    The Party's Leadership is the Guarantee for Upholding the Party Spirit Principle of the News Media
    Wang Mo
    Socialism can only be built under the leadership of the Party. Without the Party's leadership, there is no socialism. Our country's news media is part of the entire socialist cause. It is a weapon of class struggle, a tool for building socialism, and a forum for educating the people with Marxism. Therefore, it must be firmly held in the hands of the Party. If the news media is weakened or deviates from the Party's leadership, it will inevitably be usurped by the bourgeoisie and become a tool for propagating bourgeois ideology and advocating capitalist restoration, a weapon against the Party, the people, and socialism. This is the inevitable law of class struggle. The bourgeois rightists understand this very well. Therefore, when they carry out their conspiracy of restoration, they try every means to seize the weapon of the news media, stirring up trouble everywhere in order to further seize all political power.
    Party spirit is the soul of the socialist news media, and the Party's leadership is the decisive guarantee for upholding the Party spirit principle of the news media. Therefore, the spearhead of the rightists' attack on the socialist news media is mainly directed at the Party spirit and the Party's leadership of the news media.
    Let's look at the various tricks of the bourgeois rightists.
    First, the rightists stubbornly insist that the Party cannot lead the news media. They clamor that the Party committees do not understand the news business or the traditions of newspapers, so the Party committees are laymen and cannot lead the experts. Who exactly are the experts, and who are the laymen? As mentioned earlier, the socialist news media is a weapon of class struggle, a tool for building socialism, and a forum for educating the people with Marxism. Then, who understands these three tasks most clearly and thoroughly? Who are the experts? Of course, it is the political party of the working class. Any clever bourgeois political party and bourgeois intellectual cannot master socialism and Marxism, which is determined by their exploiting class nature. If it is to run a socialist news media, then the Communist Party must be the expert, while the bourgeois political party and bourgeois intellectuals must be the laymen; if it is to run a capitalist news media, then the bourgeois political party and bourgeois intellectuals can be called experts. Moreover, the news media is the sharpest weapon for conducting political struggle and ideological struggle. Politics is primary, it determines the face of the news media; technology is secondary and subordinate, it can serve both socialist news media and capitalist news media. Only the political direction of the news media is the standard that distinguishes socialist news media from capitalist news media. The primary condition for running a good socialist news media is to grasp the socialist political direction. May I ask, is there any political party in the world that can grasp the socialist political direction better than the Communist Party? As for inheriting the traditions of our country's newspapers, only our Party newspaper can do that. Among the traditions of our country's newspapers, there are the revolutionary traditions of progressive newspapers and the counter-revolutionary traditions of reactionary newspapers. Our Party newspaper is not only the inheritor of the revolutionary traditions of progressive newspapers, but also carries forward this tradition. How can it be said that the Party committees do not understand the traditions of newspapers?
    However, on this issue, some journalists still have some confused ideas and bourgeois journalistic viewpoints. They excessively exaggerate the role of technology, thus arriving at the conclusion that "technology is first, politics is second," and even embarking on the path of weakening and opposing Party spirit. This is worth being extremely vigilant about. If technology is first and politics is second, then it will inevitably lead to ignoring the political direction of the news media, being exploited by the enemy, and walking into the trap set by the bourgeoisie. It will also inevitably lead to the belief that only those who have worked in journalism are experts, while Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of Party workers are considered laymen and cannot lead the news media. This will abolish the policy of the whole Party running newspapers and the whole people running newspapers, and turn the Party and the people's news media into the business of a small number of people in the editorial department, turning the Party newspaper into a so-called "colleague newspaper." Of course, this does not mean that technical issues in the news business are insignificant. No, journalism is the most intensive writing work, and without certain writing skills, it is difficult to make it rich, colorful, lively, and vivid. Journalists must put in tremendous effort in this area.
    Secondly, the most vicious attack on the socialist news media by the rightists is to oppose Party spirit to mass character. They say that if a newspaper speaks for the Party, it cannot speak for the people; if it speaks for the people, it cannot speak for the Party. They concentrate their fire on the Party's organ newspapers. Rightist Fan Sifu said: "Organ newspapers are official newspapers, they can only speak official language, use bureaucratic jargon, and are not public opinion organs." Rightist Zhao Qi said: "Party newspapers are newspapers owned by the organs, so some things are inconvenient to say, some things cannot be said, and some things dare not be said." Moreover, they completely attribute the poor performance of newspapers to the Party's leadership, fabricating and slandering in every possible way: "Once there is a leader in mind, the newspaper will not be run well; once there are the masses, it will be run lively and vividly." Thus, they conclude: newspapers should be the mouthpiece of the masses, not organ newspapers; "colleague newspapers" should be founded, and organ newspapers should be abolished. This is the most vicious and sinister attack on the Party's news media, attempting to incite the masses to overthrow the Party's leadership over the news media, thereby overthrowing the Party's leadership over the work of the state.
    Is there a contradiction between the Party spirit and the mass character of the news media? We say, not at all. Party spirit is the concentrated expression of the class nature of the proletariat, and also the concentrated expression of mass character. The highest interests of the people are the highest interests of the proletariat, which are also the highest interests of the Party. The Party has no other interests besides the highest interests of the people. Therefore, the interests of the Party are completely consistent with the interests of the people. Now, the highest interest of the Chinese people is to realize socialism, and socialist ideology is the ideology of the proletariat; therefore, it is the proletariat that has the deepest understanding of socialism and the firmest support for it, not the petty bourgeoisie, let alone the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie's desire is to realize capitalism, and the spontaneous development of the petty bourgeoisie will only lead to capitalism. Capitalism is the road to wealth and prosperity for a few and poverty for the vast majority. Therefore, neither the bourgeoisie nor the petty bourgeoisie can represent the highest interests of the people. In short, the proletariat represents the direction of progress of human society. Only the proletariat can be selfless and consider issues from the perspective of 600 million people, taking into account both the immediate interests and the long-term interests of the people. Then, what does Party spirit contradict? Our Party spirit is extremely contradictory to bourgeois spirit, and extremely contradictory to bourgeois individualism. The mass character and people's character mentioned by the bourgeois rightists are actually just bourgeois spirit.
    Some journalists, unable to distinguish between right and wrong on this issue, have experienced ideological confusion, and some have even become prisoners of the rightists. They one-sidedly understand the mass character of newspapers, believing that to emphasize the mass character of newspapers, they can indiscriminately and uncritically publish opinions and voices from the people, regardless of whether these opinions and voices conform to the Party's policies, that is, whether they conform to the fundamental interests of the people. This is because they do not understand that the Party newspaper is both the Party's organ newspaper and the people's newspaper; the Party spirit and mass character of the newspaper are completely consistent. If a newspaper lacks sufficient mass character, it also lacks Party spirit; at the same time, if a newspaper cannot selectively and critically publish the voices and demands of the people based on the Party's policies, it is also a manifestation of a lack of Party spirit. Publishing the opinions and voices of the people indiscriminately and uncritically is precisely in line with the bourgeoisie's so-called "reporting everything heard" trick, which is extremely contrary to the Party spirit principle of newspapers and also conflicts with the interests of the people. This is because the people include different classes and strata, including the progressive, the middle, and the backward. The opinions and voices from them are sometimes correct, conforming to socialist interests; sometimes they are wrong, violating socialist interests. Therefore, newspapers should selectively and critically publish them according to the Party's policies, using Marxism and the Party's policies to educate the people. This is required by the Party spirit principle of newspapers.
    Some journalists have incorrectly understood the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, believing that since we want a hundred flowers to bloom and a hundred schools of thought to contend, newspapers can indiscriminately and uncritically open up to fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and can coexist peacefully with bourgeois ideology. This is very wrong and violates the Party spirit principle of newspapers. The Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is to promote fragrant flowers, not to develop poisonous weeds; to develop Marxism, not to propagate capitalism. Poisonous weeds cannot be released, but they should be released purposefully, and once released, they should be disinfected; once there are poisonous weeds, they should be weeded out, and poisonous weeds must never "coexist for a long time" with fragrant flowers.
    Since the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people was raised, some journalists have excessively exaggerated contradictions among the people, especially contradictions between leaders and the led, one-sidedly exaggerating the contradictory aspect between them while neglecting the more important aspect of completely consistent fundamental interests. They do not understand that in our country, contradictions between leaders and the led are contradictions that arise on the basis of completely consistent fundamental interests. The reason for their emergence is that some leaders have committed bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, while the masses inevitably have some one-sided views and incorrect understandings. Therefore, these contradictions can be smoothly resolved as long as the correct attitude and methods are adopted. The method of all-people rectification that we are currently using is to distinguish between right and wrong, raise the socialist consciousness of the masses, and overcome the three isms of leadership. This method is also the method of resolving contradictions among the people. The three isms of leadership are extremely contrary to Party spirit and mass character; the influence of bourgeois ideology among the people is completely contrary to the interests of the people. Only by strengthening the Party spirit of the news media and carrying out unremitting struggle against these bad things can we help correctly resolve contradictions among the people, transform negative factors into positive factors, and mobilize all forces to strive for the construction of socialism.
    Third, the rightists rampantly oppose the Party's leadership over the news media, stubbornly insisting that with the Party's leadership, there is no freedom of the press. Rightist Liu Binyan, under the banner of "innovator," launched a series of poisonous arrows at the Party, openly slandering: "The Party's leadership over news work is a restriction, superfluous, and hinders journalists from fully发挥their role." Rightist Ding Wang even more viciously slandered our newspapers as "semi-colonies." Their statements differ, but their purpose is the same, which is to abolish the Party's leadership over the news media and turn our news media into a weapon against the Party and socialism and a tool for restoring capitalism. Freedom is concrete and has a certain class content. With the people's socialist freedom of the press, there is no bourgeois rightists' capitalist freedom of the press; with the bourgeois rightists' capitalist freedom of the press, there is no people's socialist freedom of the press. Does the Party's leadership restrict the personal freedom of journalists? Does it hinder them from发挥 their individual roles? This depends on what kind of freedom it is and what kind of role is being 发挥. If it is the freedom of bourgeois individualism, and the role being 发挥 is to oppose socialism, then the Party must restrict and hinder it; conversely, if it is socialist freedom, and the role being 发挥 is to promote socialism, then it will not only not be restricted and hindered by the Party, but will also be encouraged and praised by the Party.
    Some journalists have extremely democratic ideas and strong bourgeois journalistic viewpoints, and have incorrect understandings of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline. They say that the Party committee interferes too much with the editorial department, restricting the full 发挥 of the personality development and creativity and initiative of journalists, and demand so-called "autonomy" and "independence." This is a wrong understanding of the relationship between the Party committee and the newspaper, and is a tendency to weaken or even negate the Party's leadership. The newspaper is a department under the leadership of the Party committee, and its relationship with the Party committee is a relationship of leadership and being led. Leadership itself includes interference. Issuing orders beforehand is one aspect of leadership; inspecting, urging, praising, criticizing, and even giving organizational punishments afterward are also important components of leadership. Not wanting interference is not wanting leadership. Newspapers should welcome and strive for the leadership of the Party committee, 发挥 their own spirit of independent responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, and should never ask the Party committee for any autonomy or independence. The Party's leadership will only help 发挥 the socialist creativity and initiative of journalists, and will never have a restrictive effect.
    Some rightists advocate that everything published in the newspaper should be "the author is responsible." This is also an idea of abolishing the Party's leadership. Our country's news media is a socialist news media, and should be responsible to the Party and the people. There are thousands upon thousands of contributors, some of whom support socialism, some of whom oppose socialism; and some understandings are one-sided and do not conform to the Party's policies. The so-called "the author is responsible" is obviously an irresponsible excuse. May I ask, what does a Party newspaper need an editorial department for? Isn't it to be responsible to the Party and the people? If this major responsibility is handed over to any contributor, then doesn't a newspaper have thousands upon thousands of editorial departments? Wouldn't the newspaper edited by such an "editorial department" become a motley crew of colors, and what socialist political direction would there be? Therefore, for any news and articles published, the editorial department should be primarily responsible to the Party and the people, although the author should also bear certain responsibility for his article.
    Fourth, some rightists want to limit the Party's comprehensive leadership over the news media. They only want the Party to provide leadership on principles and policies, but not organizational leadership; they only want the Party to issue orders, but not to "intervene" in the specific work of news organizations; they only want the Party to manage news principles and policies, but not to manage news cadres. Peng Zigang's actively advocated old Ta Kung Pao method of "only paying travel expenses" to leading reporters and the fallacy of opening a free market for news cadres, Chen Mingde's clamor for "old newspapermen" to return, Xu Zhucheng's spread of "wall demolition" experience, and the opinions of other rightists on reorganizing newspaper editorial departments are all the most poisonous conspiracies to abolish the Party's leadership organizationally. Everyone knows that the Party's principles and policies must be implemented through the Party's organizational work, and must be realized through loyal and capable cadres. If the Party only has leadership on principles and policies, but does not manage organizational leadership, does not manage cadre work, and does not conduct specific inspections and urging, then wouldn't the Party's principles and policies become empty talk? Therefore, while strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership, we must strengthen the Party's organizational leadership. The Party Central Committee's 1954 resolution and instructions on improving newspaper work instructed: "Party committees at all levels should firmly grasp their organ newspapers in their own hands, and vigorously strengthen and enrich their organ newspapers politically and organizationally." The Party Central Committee recently called on Party committees at all levels to vigorously cultivate a new force of working-class journalism. These are all major measures to ensure the implementation of the Party's principles and policies organizationally.
    The relationship between the Party committee and the newspaper and other news units is a relationship of leadership and being led. The newspaper should not only resolutely implement the Party's principles and policies, but also share the same breath, be closely connected, and be completely consistent with the Party committee, and should never make any independence. The Party's organ newspaper is also the people's newspaper, it speaks for the Party and also speaks for the people, and should never only speak for a small number of people in the editorial department. The staff of the editorial department should act completely in accordance with the Party's principles and policies, and should never mix in personal preferences and interests; they should strengthen their own training and cultivation, so that their preferences and interests conform as much as possible to the Party's principles and policies, and conform to the interests and interests of the people. If personal interests and interests conflict with the Party's policies and the interests of the people, then personal interests and interests should be unconditionally sacrificed, and the Party's principles and policies and the interests of the people should be resolutely obeyed. This is a necessary condition for upholding the Party spirit principle of newspapers.
    The Party's leadership over the news media is the decisive guarantee for implementing the socialist direction of the news media, and is a necessary condition for embodying the Party spirit of the news media. Without the Party's leadership, there is no Party spirit, and there is no socialist news media. Whether it is a Party newspaper or other news media led by the Party (including the newspapers of democratic parties), it must work under the leadership of the Party. Any weakening of the Party's leadership will open the door wide for the flooding of bourgeois ideology, and may even be exploited by the enemy to tamper with the political direction of our news media. The lessons of Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily are worthy of our deep reflection.

### 党的领导是坚持新闻事业党性原则的保证

    党的领导是坚持新闻事业党性原则的保证
    王谟
    社会主义事业必须在党的领导下才能建设起来。离开党的领导，便没有社会主义。我国的新闻事业是整个社会主义事业的一部分。它是阶级斗争的武器，是建设社会主义的工具，是用马克思主义教育人民的讲坛，因此，必须牢牢地掌握在党的手里。如果新闻事业稍一削弱或脱离党的领导，它就必然会被资产阶级所篡夺，变成宣扬资产阶级思想和鼓吹资本主义复辟的工具，变成反党反人民反社会主义的武器。这是阶级斗争的必然规律。资产阶级右派是十分了解这个道理的，因此，当他们进行阴谋复辟的时候，他们就千方百计地夺取新闻事业这个武器，到处煽风点火，以便进一步夺取全部政权。
    党性是社会主义新闻事业的灵魂，而党的领导乃是坚持新闻事业党性原则的决定性的保证。因此，右派分子对社会主义新闻事业进攻的矛头，主要是指向新闻事业的党性和党的领导的。
    请看资产阶级右派分子的种种伎俩。
    第一，右派分子硬说党不能领导新闻事业，他们大肆喧嚷：党委不懂新闻业务，不懂报纸的传统，所以党委是外行，不能领导内行。究竟谁是内行，谁是外行呢？前面说过，社会主义新闻事业是阶级斗争的武器，是建设社会主义的工具，是用马克思主义教育人民的讲坛。那末，对于这三个任务是谁了解得最清楚最透彻呢？谁是内行呢？当然是工人阶级的政党。任何高明的资产阶级政党和资产阶级知识分子，是无法掌握社会主义和马克思主义的，这是为其剥削阶级的本质所决定的。要是办社会主义的新闻事业，那末共产党就必然是内行，而资产阶级政党和资产阶级知识分子就必然是外行；要是办资本主义的新闻事业，那末资产阶级政党和资产阶级知识分子才能称为内行。并且，新闻事业是进行政治斗争和思想斗争的最尖锐的武器。政治是第一位，是决定新闻事业面目的东西；技术是第二位的、从属性的东西，它既可以为社会主义新闻事业服务，又可以为资本主义新闻事业服务。只有新闻事业的政治方向，才是区别社会主义新闻事业和资本主义新闻事业的标准。办好社会主义新闻事业的首要条件，就是掌握社会主义的政治方向。试问，世界上还有什么政党能比共产党掌握社会主义政治方向更好的呢？至于继承我国报纸的传统，这也只有我们的党报才能做得到的。我国报纸的传统中，有进步报纸的革命传统，也有反动报纸的反革命传统。我们的党报不仅是进步报纸革命传统的继承者，而且把这个传统发扬光大了。怎能说党委不懂得报纸的传统呢？
    但是在这个问题上，还有一些新闻工作者存在着一些糊涂思想和资产阶级新闻观点。他们过分地夸大技术的作用，因而得出“技术第一、政治第二”的结论，甚至走上削弱和反对党性的道路。这是值得万分警惕的。如果技术第一、政治第二，那就必然会漠视新闻事业的政治方向，就会被敌人所利用，走向资产阶级所设的陷阱。那也就必然会认为只有作过新闻工作的人才是内行，而各级党委和广大的党的工作者倒反被认为外行，不能领导新闻事业。这样就会取消全党办报、全民办报的方针，而把党和人民的新闻事业办成编辑部少数人的事业，把党报变成所谓“同人报”。当然，这并不是说，新闻业务中的技术问题是无足轻重的问题。不是的，新闻工作是最紧张的文字工作，没有一定的文字技巧，是很难把它办得丰富多采、生动活泼的。新闻工作者必须在这方面付出巨大的劳动。
    其次，右派分子对于社会主义新闻事业最恶毒的攻击，是把党性同群众性对立起来。他们说，报纸如果代表党说话，就不能代表人民群众说话；如果代表人民群众说话，就不能代表党说话。他们集中火力进攻党的机关报。右派分子范四夫说：“机关报是官方的报纸，只能说机关话，打官腔，而不是舆论机关。”右派分子赵琪说：“党报是机关所有制的报纸，所以有些话不便讲，有些话不能讲，有些话不敢讲。”并且，他们把报纸办不好的原因完全归之于党的领导，百般造谣污蔑；“心目中一有了领导，报纸就办不好；一有了群众，就办得生动活泼。”于是，他们得出结论：报纸应当是群众的喉舌，不应是机关报；应当创办“同人报”，取消机关报。这是对党的新闻事业最恶毒最凶狠的攻击，企图借此煽动群众，推翻党对新闻事业的领导，从而推翻党对国家工作的领导。
    新闻事业的党性同群众性是否矛盾呢？我们说，一点也不矛盾。党性是无产阶级的阶级性集中的表现，也是群众性集中的表现。人民群众的最高利益，就是无产阶级的最高利益，也就是党的最高利益。除了人民群众的最高利益以外，党再没有自己的其他利益。因此，党的利益同人民群众的利益是完全一致的。现在，中国人民群众的最高利益是实现社会主义，而社会主义思想是无产阶级的思想；因此，对社会主义认识最深刻、拥护最坚决的是无产阶级，而不是小资产阶级，更不是资产阶级。资产阶级的愿望是实现资本主义，小资产阶级自发地发展也只会走向资本主义。资本主义是少数人发财致富、绝大多数人贫困的道路，因此，不论资产阶级也好，小资产阶级也好，是都不能代表人民群众的最高利益的。总之，无产阶级代表着人类社会前进的方向。只有无产阶级才能大公无私，才能在考虑问题时，从六亿人口出发，既照顾到人民群众的眼前利益，又照顾到他们的长远利益。那末，党性同什么有矛盾呢？我们的党性是同资产阶级性极端矛盾的，是同资产阶级的个人主义极端矛盾的。资产阶级右派分子所说的群众性、人民性，实际上只是资产阶级性。
    有些新闻工作者，在这个问题上分不清大是大非，发生过思想混乱，有些人甚至作了右派的俘虏。他们片面地了解报纸的群众性，认为要强调报纸的群众性，就可以无选择地无批判地登载来自人民群众中的意见和呼声，不管这些意见和呼声是否符合党的政策，也就是说，是否合乎人民群众的根本利益。这是由于不了解党报是党的机关报，同时又是人民群众的报纸；报纸的党性同群众性是完全一致的。如果报纸缺乏充分的群众性，也就是缺乏党性；同时，如果报纸不能根据党的方针政策有选择有批判地发表人民群众的呼声和要求，也是缺乏党性的一种表现。无选择无批判地发表人民群众的意见和呼声，是正中了资产阶级所谓“有闻必录”的诡计，是同报纸的党性原则极端相违背的，也是同人民群众的利益相冲突的。这是因为，人民群众中包括着不同的阶级和阶层，包括着进步的、中间的和落后的三个部分。来自他们中的意见和呼声，有的是正确的，是符合社会主义利益的；有的是错误的，是违反社会主义利益的。因此，报纸应当根据党的政策有选择地有批判地给以刊载，用马克思主义和党的政策教育人民群众。这是报纸的党性原则所要求的。
    有些新闻工作者，对于党的百花齐放和百家争鸣的政策，作了不正确的理解，以为既然要百花齐放、百家争鸣，报纸就可以无选择地无批判地开放香花和毒草，可以同资产阶级的思想和平共处。这是非常错误的，是违反报纸的党性原则的。党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策，是为了繁荣香花，而不是发展毒草；是为了发展马克思主义，而不是为了宣扬资本主义。毒草不是不可以放，但是应该有目的地放，放了就要消毒；有了毒草就要锄草，绝不能使毒草同鲜花“长期共存”。
    自正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题提出后，有一部分新闻工作者，过分地夸大人民内部矛盾、特别是领导同被领导间的矛盾，片面地夸大他们之间的矛盾的一面，而忽视了根本利益完全一致的更加重要的一面。他们不了解在我们的国家内，领导同被领导之间的矛盾，是在根本利益完全一致的基础上所产生的矛盾。其产生的原因是某些领导方面犯了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，而群众方面又不免有些片面观点和不正确认识。因此，对于这些矛盾，只要采用正确的态度和方法，就可以顺利地解决。我们现在所用的全民整风的方法，就是分清是非，提高群众的社会主义觉悟，克服领导上的三个主义。这个方法也就是解决人民内部矛盾的方法。领导上的三个主义，是同党性和群众性极端相反的；人民群众中的资产阶级思想影响，是同人民群众的利益完全违背的。只有加强新闻事业的党性，向这些坏东西进行不懈的斗争，才能有助于正确地解决人民内部矛盾，化消极因素为积极因素，动员一切力量，为建设社会主义而奋斗。
    第三，右派分子猖狂地反对党对新闻事业的领导，硬说有了党的领导，便没有新闻自由。右派分子刘宾雁打着“革新者”的旗帜，向党发出一连串的毒箭，公开污蔑：“党对新闻工作的领导是限制，是多此一举，是妨碍新闻工作者充分发挥作用的。”右派分子丁望更恶毒地污蔑我们的报纸是“半殖民地”。他们的说法不一，而目的却是一致的，就是要取消党对新闻事业的领导，把我们的新闻事业变成反党反社会主义武器和复辟资本主义的工具。自由是具体的，是有一定的阶级内容的。有了人民群众的社会主义的新闻自由，便没有资产阶级右派的资本主义新闻自由；有了资产阶级右派的资本主义新闻自由，便没有人民群众的社会主义新闻自由。党的领导是否会限制新闻工作者的个人自由呢？是否会阻碍他们发挥个人作用呢？这就要看是什么样的自由，以及发挥的是什么样的作用。如果是资产阶级个人主义的自由，以及发挥的是反对社会主义的作用，那么党一定要加以限制和阻碍；反之，如果是社会主义的自由，以及发挥的是促进社会主义的作用，那么它就不但不会受到党的限制和阻碍，而且会受到党的鼓励和表扬。
    有一些新闻工作者有着极端民主化的思想和浓厚的资产阶级新闻观点，对于民主和集中、自由和纪律有着错误的认识。他们说什么党委对编辑部干涉过多，限制了新闻记者的个性发展以及创造性和积极性的充分发挥，要求所谓“自主性”和“独立性”。这是对党委同报纸的关系作了错误的了解，是削弱甚至否定党的领导的一种倾向。报纸是党委领导下的一个部门，它同党委的关系是领导同被领导的关系。领导本身就包括着干涉。事前发施号令，是领导的一个方面；事后检查督促，表扬批评，甚至给以组织处分，也是领导的重要组成部分。不要干涉，就是不要领导。报纸应当欢迎和争取党委的领导，在党委的领导下发挥自己独立负责的精神，而决不应当向党委要求什么自主性或独立性。党的领导只会有助于发挥新闻工作者的社会主义创造性和积极性，而决不会有限制的作用。
    有些右派分子主张报纸上刊登的东西一概“文责自负”。这也是一种取消党的领导的思想。我国的新闻事业，是社会主义新闻事业，是应当对党和人民负责的。投稿者千千万万，有赞成社会主义的，也有反对社会主义的；还有一些认识是片面的，是不符合党的政策的。所谓“文责自负”，显然是完全不负责任的一种借口。试问，党报要一个编辑部干什么呢？不是要它对党和人民负责吗？如果把这个重大的责任交给任何一个投稿者，那末一个报纸不是有了千千万万个编辑部了吗？这样的“编辑部”编出的报纸，岂不成了五光十色的大杂烩，还有什么社会主义政治方向呢？因此，发表任何新闻和文章，编辑部都应该是对党和人民负首要的责任的，虽然作者也要对他的文章担负一定的责任。
    第四，有些右派分子，要限制党对新闻事业的全面领导。只要党作方针政策的领导，而不要组织领导；只要党发施号令，而不要党“插手”新闻机关的具体工作；只要党管新闻方针政策，而不要管新闻干部。右派分子彭子冈所积极鼓吹的旧大公报“只发路费”的领导记者的方法和开辟新闻干部自由市场的谬论，右派分子陈铭德所发出的“老报人”归队的叫嚣，右派分子徐铸成所传播的“拆墙”经验，以及其他一些右派分子所提出的改组报纸编辑部的意见，都是要从组织上取消党的领导的最毒辣的阴谋。大家知道，党的方针政策，必须通过党的组织工作去贯彻，必须通过忠实而又能干的干部去实现。如果党只有方针政策的领导，而不管组织领导，不管干部工作，不作具体的检查和督促，那末党的方针政策岂不成了纸上谈兵？因此，在加强党的政治思想领导的同时，必须加强党的组织领导。党中央1954年关于改进报纸工作的决议指示：“各级党的委员会应该把它们的机关报紧紧地掌握在自己手里，并从政治上、组织上大力健全和充实自己的机关报。”党中央最近又号召各级党委大力培养工人阶级的新闻队伍。这都是为了从组织上保证贯彻执行党的方针政策的重大措施。
    党委同报纸和其他新闻单位的关系，是领导同被领导的关系。报纸不仅要坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策，并且要同党委呼吸与共，息息相通，步调完全一致，而决不应闹任何独立性。党的机关报同时是人民群众的报纸，它代表党讲话，同时也代表人民群众讲话，而决不应只代表编辑部少数人讲话。编辑部的工作人员，应当完全遵照党的方针政策办事，决不应当夹杂个人的好恶和兴趣；应当加强自己的锻炼和修养，使自己的好恶和兴趣尽量符合党的方针和政策，符合人民群众的利益和兴趣。如果个人的利益和兴趣同党的政策和人民群众的利益发生矛盾，那就应当无条件地牺牲个人的利益和兴趣，坚决服从党的方针政策和人民群众的利益。这是坚持报纸的党性原则所必需的条件。
    党对新闻事业的领导，是贯彻新闻事业社会主义方向的决定性的保证，是体现新闻事业党性的必要条件。没有党的领导，就没党性，就没有社会主义的新闻事业。不论是党报还是党所领导的其他新闻事业（包括民主党派的报纸），都必须在党的领导下进行工作。任何削弱党的领导的作法，都会为资产阶级的思想泛滥大开方便之门，甚至被敌人利用，篡改我们新闻事业的政治方向。文汇报和光明日报的教训，是值得我们深思的。
