The development process of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant in the past few years after its completion is an inspiration to us.

In 1954, it was called "not having enough to eat." The production capacity was lowered a lot, but it still couldn't be sold, which put such a brand-new, modern factory in a difficult situation. At the same time, the large amount of seamless steel tubes needed domestically had to be imported from abroad.

In 1956, after adding new varieties and expanding sales channels, the situation suddenly reversed, and it was no longer "not having enough to eat," but "not being able to finish eating."

In 1958, the seamless steel tubes it will produce will exceed two-thirds of its designed capacity.

Before 1962, its production will be raised even higher, and compared with the original design capacity, one factory will become two factories.

The reason we want to introduce this example is because this matter has a certain universal significance.

In the first Five-Year Plan, there were 825 large industrial construction projects above the limit in our country, more than half of which have been completed and put into production, and the rest will also be completed and put into production one after another. This is our backbone industry. It is precisely because of this batch of modern large industries that we say that our country has established the initial foundation of socialist industrialization. However, some of these new large enterprises have also experienced the "difficulties" like the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant in 1954. Some enterprises have not yet completely escaped that "difficult" situation. The reasons are various, some because of insufficient raw materials, some because of few varieties, some because of insufficient experience, and so on. And these enterprises all have many new equipment, some of which are very advanced in the world, so the potential production capacity is very large. How to quickly realize the huge potential has become an urgent issue for these enterprises.

For each such new enterprise, the realization of production potential does not need to exceed the design capacity by one time like the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant. As long as it can exceed 20%, then we are equivalent to building more than 160 new factories.

How to fully realize the potential of these newly built large enterprises? The paths are different, but one thing is certain: as long as you make serious efforts, the problem can definitely be solved. The Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant has proved this to us.

Things are often like this, it seems very difficult, but as long as you open your mind, broaden your horizons, and make a solid effort, even the highest peaks can be climbed.

    多高的山峰也能攀上

    鞍山无缝钢管厂建成以后的这几年的发展过程，对我们是一个启发。
    1954年叫做“吃不饱”，把生产能力压低了很多，还是销不出去，使这样一个全新的、现代化的大工厂，陷入了困境。而同时，国内需要的大量无缝钢管，却又不得不由国外进口。
    1956年增加了新品种扩大了销路以后，情况顿时倒过来，不是“吃不饱”，而是“吃不完”。
    1958年，它要生产的无缝钢管，将超过设计能力的三分之二。
    1962年以前，它的生产还要提得更高，和原设计能力比较，一个工厂变成了两个工厂。
    我们所以要介绍这个例子，是因为这件事有一定的普遍意义。
    在第一个五年计划中，我国限额以上的大工业建设，共有八百二十五项，一半以上已经建成投入生产，其余的也将陆续完工生产，这是我们的骨干工业。就是因为有了这一批现代化的大工业，我们才说，我国已经建立起社会主义工业化的初步基础。可是这些新的大的企业中的一部分，也出现过像鞍山无缝钢管厂在1954年那样的“困境”。有的企业，现在也还没有完全摆脱那种“困境”。原因是多样的，有的因为原材料不足，有的因为品种不多，有的因为经验不够，等等。而这些企业，都拥有很多新式设备，其中有些在世界上也是很先进的，因而生产的潜在能力很大。如何尽快地把巨大的潜在力发挥出来，就成为这些企业当前的迫切问题了。
    每个这样的新企业，生产潜力的发挥，不用像鞍山无缝钢管厂那样，超过设计能力一倍，只要能超过20％，那末我们就等于多建了一百六十多个新工厂。
    怎样充分发挥这些新建大企业的潜力？途径各有不同，但是有一点可以肯定的：只要经过认真的努力，问题一定能够解决。鞍山无缝钢管厂向我们作了证明。
    事情往往是这样，看起来困难得很，其实只要你把脑筋打开，把眼光放远，切切实实作了一番努力，多高的山峰也能攀上。
