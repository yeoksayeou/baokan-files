Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 5th. The entire workforce of the Hong Kong Naval Dockyard, at lunchtime on the 4th, were forced to take action, refusing to leave the factory, in another protest against the dockyard's unreasonable attitude regarding the dismissal of workers. This is the fifth strike protest staged by the dockyard workers.

Since the Hong Kong Naval Dockyard's closure and dismissal incident, the dockyard authorities have consistently refused to accept the workers' three demands for reasonable severance pay, provident fund, and job placement, and have continued to dismiss workers incessantly. On the morning of the 4th, the dockyard authorities issued a fifth batch of dismissal letters and insisted on dismissing a worker representative from the dockyard's gunnery department and deducting the workers' wages for the time they were on strike. The dockyard authorities' unreasonable attitude aroused even greater dissatisfaction among the workers. At noon on the 4th, over four thousand workers gathered in the square near the dock gate and at the entrances of various factory departments, refusing to leave the factory, to express a strong protest to the dockyard. The protest action ended in an orderly manner at 1 p.m. During this period, many workers' family members and workers from various industries rushed to the dockyard's gate to visit, expressing concern and support for the dockyard workers' protest action.

In the past week, Hong Kong's various trade unions have written letters of condolence to the dockyard workers. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions' support committee has decided to give greater support to the dockyard workers. Workers from Hong Kong Tramways, Electric Light, Telephone, Electricity, and Gas companies jointly held a solidarity rally, telling dockyard workers that "whatever you need, we will support you." Many social organizations have also written letters appealing to relevant parties, hoping that the dockyard incident will be resolved reasonably as soon as possible. The dismissed dockyard workers established the "Naval Dockyard Unemployed Workers Group" on the 2nd, demanding that the Hong Kong authorities' Labor Department effectively arrange employment for the workers.

    香港海军船坞当局坚持无理态度
    全体工人举行停工抗议
    新华社香港5日电　香港海军船坞全体工人在4日中午十二时放工时间，被迫采取拒绝出厂的行动，再一次抗议坞方对解雇工人事件的无理态度。这是船坞工人举行的第五次停工抗议。
    香港海军船坞闭厂除人事件发生以来，船坞当局一直拒绝接受工人提出的发给合理的遣散费、公积金和安置职业的三项要求，并且继续不断开除工人。4日清晨，船坞当局又发出第五批解雇书，并且坚持要开除船坞炮房部一名工人代表和扣除工人停工时间的薪金。船坞当局的这种无理态度，引起工人更大的不满。4日中午，船坞四千多人集中在近坞闸的广场和各厂部门口，拒绝出厂，向坞方表示强硬的抗议。抗议行动直到下午一时才有秩序的结束。在这段时间，很多工人的家属和各业工人赶到船坞的大闸口看望，对船坞工人的抗议行动表示了关怀和支持。
    在近一周来，香港各业工会纷纷写信慰问船坞工人。港九工会联合会支援委员会已决定对船坞工人给予更大的支持。香港电车、电灯、电话、电力和煤气工人曾联合举行慰问大会，向船坞工人表示他们“要什么就支援什么”。许多社会团体还写信向有关方面呼吁，希望船坞事件早日获得合理的解决。被开除的船坞工人已在2日成立了“海军船坞失业工人团”，要求香港当局劳工处切实安置工人就业。
