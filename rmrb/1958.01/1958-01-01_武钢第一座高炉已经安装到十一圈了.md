The First Blast Furnace at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corp. Has Been Installed Up to the Eleventh Ring

Today, the construction site of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is blessed with gentle breezes and warm sunshine. The construction site of the No. 1 blast furnace is enveloped in a unique atmosphere of joyful labor. The famous Jiang Xinhe hoisting team and other hoisting workers on the construction site are waving red and green flags and using crisp whistles to direct four cranes in simultaneously hoisting the furnace shell of the blast furnace and hot blast stove, as well as the steel columns of the blast furnace iron-tapping plant. The mutual challenge and response letters issued by the builders at the end of 1957, as well as slogans and resolutions guaranteeing the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace quickly, well, and economically, are densely posted on the bulletin boards on the construction site. The person in charge of the construction site took the freshly inked statistical report from the statistician and told the reporter: "We have completed the civil engineering of the No. 1 blast furnace system ahead of schedule by ten days in 1957; the metal structure installation project originally planned to install only nine rings of the blast furnace body in 1957, but today it has been installed to the eleventh ring."

    武钢第一座高炉已经安装到十一圈了
    今天，武汉钢铁公司工地风和日暖。正在建设的一号高炉工地上，今天笼罩着特有的欢欣的劳动气氛。工地上著名的江新河吊装小组和其他吊装工人们，扬着红绿旗用清脆的哨声指挥着四部起重机，在同时吊装高炉、热风炉的炉壳和高炉出铁厂的钢柱。建设者们在1957年岁尾发出的相互挑战、应战书，以及保证又多又快又好又省的建设一号高炉的标语和决心书，密密地张贴在工地上的公告栏里。工地负责人从统计员手里接过墨迹未干的统计表报对记者说：“我们已经提前十天完成了1957年一号高炉系统的土建工程；金属结构的安装工程原来计划1957年只安装九圈高炉炉体，今天已经安装到十一圈了。”
