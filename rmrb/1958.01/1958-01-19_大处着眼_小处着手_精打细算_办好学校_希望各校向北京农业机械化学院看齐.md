(Reported by this newspaper) The Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, during its rectification campaign, paid attention to implementing the principle of "running schools diligently and thriftily." It conducted a series of socialist ideological education initiatives, successively launching education campaigns on "cherishing public property" and establishing a "hardworking and simple, opposing extravagance and waste" ethos. It organized major debates on issues such as labor education, cadre assignment to lower levels, and "red versus expert," profoundly impacting the thinking of all teachers, students, and staff, and resulting in many new developments.

The institute has consistently adhered to the staffing quotas approved by the relevant ministry in terms of organizational structure and personnel allocation. Therefore, since its establishment, it has never exceeded its allocated staff. After the rectification, in accordance with the spirit of streamlining organizations and assigning cadres to lower levels, corresponding streamlining was carried out. For example, organizationally, departments were retained, while some sections were abolished or merged, the reference rooms of each teaching and research group were merged, and the reference room was merged with the office. In terms of personnel, it was decided to abolish full-time librarians, with relevant reference work being handled by teaching assistants. In addition, 40% of the teaching support staff were streamlined, and apprentices were appropriately reduced. Regarding administrative personnel, the secretaries of the president and vice-presidents and the deputy heads of departments were streamlined, and general staff were also significantly reduced. For example, the General Affairs Department was reduced from its original staffing of thirty-four to nineteen. The staffing ratio of the institute, which was 1:3.2 (teachers and staff to students) before streamlining, will reach 1:4 after streamlining.

In terms of actively participating in physical labor and establishing a hardworking and simple ethos, the institute has organized teachers and students to clean offices, classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, and toilets, repair the campus, level the grounds, and repair roads. The students have also established contact with the "May Fourth" and "Starlight" Agricultural Cooperatives and have begun to voluntarily participate in the agricultural cooperatives' voluntary labor on Sundays, with each grade taking turns. At the same time, in order to combine professional practice with strengthened management and labor, each first-year class is allocated eight mu of land, and each second-year class is allocated four mu of land. Under the guidance of teachers, they cultivate and manage the land themselves. The third-year students are responsible for the maintenance of the machine depot and machinery, and leveling the grounds. The fourth-year students participate in the maintenance of machines in the metalworking repair workshop and leveling the grounds.

Regarding the use of student aid, many students have further recognized the significance of the state's provision of student aid and the need to cultivate a hardworking and simple style and not rely entirely on the state. Therefore, since September of last year, the proportion of students receiving student aid has gradually decreased. In particular, after the Ministry of Higher Education issued instructions on resolutely implementing the principle of "building the country diligently and thriftily, and running schools diligently and thriftily," the students of Machine One immediately supported this instruction and actively proposed to lower their grade levels and suggested that the school make a major adjustment to the student aid issue. Now, many classes have automatically organized haircut mutual aid groups to save on haircut expenses, and a hardworking and simple ethos is gradually taking shape in other aspects of daily life.

Regarding the use of housing and capital construction, administrative office space was reduced by 29%, freeing up 794 square meters of space for teaching purposes, solving the problem of students' self-study and tutoring, and appropriately improving students' living conditions, from seven or eight people per room to six people per room. In 1958, capital construction will involve the construction of 1,500 square meters of simple bungalows (at a unit price of 23 yuan per square meter) for use as family housing, and the remaining investment plan has been returned to the Ministry of Agriculture.

In terms of financial expenditure, when preparing the 1958 budget, the potential capacity of existing equipment was taken into consideration as much as possible. For example, the copper sulfate solution used by the physics group in experiments is made from recycled waste products, and it is planned to reuse it after filtering. For example, the 1958 production practice expenditure budget was originally more than 130,000 yuan. After detailed research with the departments and teaching and research groups, it was decided to combine the fourth-year internship with land reclamation, and the second-year factory internship and the third-year supplementary metalworking internship, originally planned to go to the Northeast, were changed to be carried out in batches in factories in Beijing and Tianjin, saving the state 60,000 yuan.

Various measures have been taken to cherish public property and save water and electricity. For example, all the street lights in the institute were replaced, the electric bell wires were modified, a system of regular inspection and repair of water, electricity, doors, windows, and furniture was established, repair registration books were set up in each building, a system of compensation for damage to public property was established, and the practice of turning off the lights and water at 10 pm was strictly enforced. As a result, significant achievements have been made in saving water and electricity. For example, comparing the amount of water and electricity used in January and November 1957, the cost of tap water was reduced by 660 yuan, and the cost of electricity was reduced by 781 yuan.

    大处着眼　小处着手　精打细算　办好学校
    希望各校向北京农业机械化学院看齐
    本报讯　北京农业机械化学院在整改中，注意贯彻“勤俭办学”的方针，进行了一系列的社会主义思想教育，先后开展了“爱护公共财物”，树立“艰苦朴素、反对铺张浪费”的教育，组织了关于劳动教育、干部下放以及“红与专”等问题的大辩论，全体师生员工的思想受到了极深刻的影响，并出现了不少新的气象。
    该院在机构及人员编制方面，一贯能根据主管部核定的编制定额，注意掌握，因此建校以来，从无超编现象。整改以后，根据紧缩机构、干部下放的精神，又作了相应的紧缩。例如在机构上，保留处，取消和合并一部分科，各教研组资料室合并，资料室与办公室合并；在人员方面，已决定取消专任资料员，有关资料工作，由助教兼任，此外又精简了40％的教辅人员和适当地精简了徒工；在行政人员方面，精简了校院长的秘书和处的副职，一般职工也作了大力的精简，例如总务处由原编制三十四人精简为十九人。该院的编制比例，由未精简时教职工与学生的比例1∶3.2将达到精简后的1∶4。
    在积极参加体力劳动，树立艰苦朴素的风气方面，该院已组织师生自己打扫办公室、教室、实验室、寝室、厕所、修整校园、平整场地、修马路等工作。同学们并和“五四”“星光”二农业社建立联系，已开始每周利用星期日，各年级轮流自觉地参加农业社的义务劳动。同时，为了使业务实习和加强管理及劳动相结合，一年级每班分地八亩，二年级分地四亩，在老师的指导下，自己耕作，自己管理；三年级负责机库机具的保养和平场地，四年级参加金工修理实习车间的机器保养及平场地。
    在助学金的使用上，不少同学进一步认识国家发放助学金的意义，进一步认识必须养成艰苦朴素的作风，不能依靠国家全部包下来，因而自去年9月份以来，享受助学金的比例，逐步有所下降。特别自高教部发出关于切实贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭办学”的方针指示后，机一班同学立即拥护这个指示，主动提出要降低等级，并建议校方对助学金问题，应作一个大的调整。现在不少班级的同学，已自动组织了理发互助组，以节省理发费的开支，在其他日常生活上，也正在逐渐形成艰苦朴素的风气。
    关于房屋的使用及基本建设方面，紧缩行政用房29％，为教学用房腾出七百九十四平方公尺的面积，解决了同学的自习和辅导之用，并适当改善了学生的居住条件，由七、八人一屋改为六人一屋。1958年基本建设，将建一千五百平方公尺的简易平房（单价每平方公尺二十三元），用作眷属住宅，并已将剩余的投资计划，退交农业部。
    在财务开支方面，编制1958年预算时，尽量考虑现有设备的潜在能力。如物理组在实验时使用的硫酸铜液，是将过去废品加以利用的，现经过过滤后，拟再度使用它。又如1958年生产实习费用预算原为十三万余元，后经与系、教研组详细研究后，决定将四年级实习合并在开荒中进行，二年级的工厂实习和三年级补作的金工实习，由原计划到东北去的改为分批去京、津两地工厂实习，就为国家节省了六万元。
    爱护公共财物，节省水、电方面，采取了各种措施。例如更换了全院路灯，改装电铃线，建立了关于水、电、门窗、家具的定期检查修理制度，并在各楼设立修理登记簿，建立公共财物损坏赔偿制度，严格执行晚间十时熄灯和关水，因此在水、电节约方面，有了显著的成绩。如1957年1月和11月水电用量比较，自来水费节约六百六十元，电费节约七百八十一元。
