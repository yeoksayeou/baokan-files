The human body possesses a series of natural defense mechanisms to resist and repel bacteria—the enemies of mankind.

When bacteria invade the human body, the skin and mucous membranes are the first to mount a vigorous counterattack. They can be said to be the first line of defense for the human body in fighting against foreign pathogens.

The skin, as the outermost layer of tough tissue enveloping the body, is like the steel plates in the defensive works on a battlefield, offering great resistance to external harm. At the same time, the skin has a secretion that can kill bacteria. For example, on carefully washed skin, pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus, typhoid bacilli, etc., can be killed in a very short time.

Mucous membranes, like the skin, can prevent bacteria from entering the body. Mucous membranes have the mechanical ability to clear foreign objects, relying on the movement of mucous glands and the cilia of the respiratory tract epithelium, expelling tiny particles and invading bacteria from the body with mucus and phlegm through sneezing and coughing. If bacteria enter the oral cavity, they will be annihilated by lysozyme in the saliva. If bacteria slip through the cracks in the oral cavity and infiltrate the stomach and intestines, they will die under the acidity of gastric juice; certain bacterial toxins will also be destroyed and lose their combat power under the action of gastric and intestinal fluids and bile.

If, unfortunately, the first line of defense is breached and bacteria launch a deep attack on the human body, then the central nervous system (cerebral cortex)—our central command headquarters—will receive a report requesting assistance and begin emergency and comprehensive deployment. The body's lymphatic tissue and blood will all be mobilized, and millions of white blood cells and lymphocytes will be continuously sent to the front line, forming the second line of defense. White blood cells engage in close combat with bacteria, greatly exerting their phagocytic action, swallowing and devouring the bacteria. The blood, which surrounds and suppresses bacteria from all directions, can also produce a germ-killing substance—antibodies—to coordinate combat.

If the number of enemies is small, their virulence is low, and their infectiousness is not strong, then, after such a battle, the enemies will all be buried in the second line of defense.

If the second line of defense is also breached, and bacteria invade the deep tissues or internal organs of the human body, the war becomes even more intense and arduous. At this time, the central command headquarters will change its strategy, no longer engaging in large-scale positional warfare, but rather eliminating enemy strongholds one by one. This time, the body's local tissue cells mainly participate in the battle, with white blood cells coordinating the fight, which is the third line of defense.

The liver is the most powerful fortress in this line of defense. On the one hand, it stores military materials to supply needs, that is, it converts the absorbed digestive product glucose into glycogen for storage, and then converts glycogen into glucose and transports it into the blood when needed; on the other hand, it highly exerts its combat power (the interstitial cells in the liver have a high phagocytic effect), causing bacteria to lose their combat power, flowing out of the liver with bile into the duodenum, and then being excreted from the large intestine.

The kidney is also a solid fortress, continuing to perform its regular task of excreting waste during the war, expelling metabolic products such as urea and uric acid from the body, and at the same time driving out invading bacteria, allowing them to flow out with urine (typhoid bacilli can be found in the urine of typhoid patients).

The most solid and powerful fortress is, of course, the central command headquarters. It is composed of the endothelium of the brain capillaries and the choroid plexus of the ventricles (the choroid plexus is a folded structure of the pia mater rich in blood vessels), and violent and frenzied enemies find it difficult to break into this specially equipped castle.

However, generally speaking, when bacteria reach the third line of defense, that is, when they invade the deep tissues of the human body or occupy an internal organ, the problem has become serious and external support is needed; one must rely on the help of drugs.

Therefore, don't think that because the human body has an instinct to kill bacteria, you can be carefree. No, you cannot be careless; you must actively exercise your body in peacetime, develop clean and hygienic habits, and get vaccinated on time, so that bacteria have no opportunity to take advantage of, and only then can we have a healthy body.

    人体有杀灭细菌的本能
  　蒋野萍
    一个健康人的身体，具有一系列的自然防御装置，可以抵抗并反击细菌——人类的敌人的进攻。
    当细菌向人体侵袭的时候，皮肤和粘膜组织就会最先起来给以猛力的还击。它俩可说是人体对外来病菌作战的第一道防线。
    皮肤是包裹身体最外一层的坚韧组织，就像战场上防御工程中的钢板，对外界的侵害有很大的抵抗力。同时皮肤有一种分泌物，能杀灭细菌。例如在仔细地洗净了手的皮肤上，只需很短的时间，就能杀死化脓性的葡萄球菌、伤寒杆菌等。
    粘膜，同皮肤一样能够阻止细菌进入人体。粘膜具有机械的清除异物的能力，依靠粘液腺和呼吸道上皮颤毛的运动，通过喷嚏、咳嗽，促使微小的颗粒和侵犯的细菌随着粘液、痰排出体外。细菌如果进入口腔，就会被唾液里的一种溶菌酶歼灭。细菌要是从口腔里漏纲潜入胃肠，就会在胃液的酸度作用下死亡；某些细菌毒素在胃肠液及胆汁的作用下，也会被破坏到失去战斗力量。
    如果不幸第一道防线被突破，细菌向人体深入进攻来了。那末，中枢神经系统（大脑皮层）——我们的中央作战指挥部就会接到请求援助的报告，开始紧急的全面的部署，身体上的淋巴组织和血液就都进行了总动员，成千成万的白血球和淋巴球源源开向最前线，筑成第二道防线。白血球和细菌短兵相接，大大发挥吞噬作用，把细菌吞食光。从四面八方向细菌围剿的血液中，还能出现一种杀敌物质——抗体，协同作战。
    要是敌人的数量不多，毒力不大，传染力不强，那末，经过这样一场战斗，敌人就会全部被埋葬在第二道防线里。
    要是第二道防线也竟然被突破，细菌侵入了人体的深层组织或人体内脏，战争也就更加紧张和艰苦了。中央作战指挥部这时就会改变战略，不再是大规模的阵地战，而是逐一消灭敌人的据点。这时主要由身体局部的组织细胞参加战斗，由白血球协同作战，这就是第三道防线。
    肝脏是这道防线内最有力的堡垒。它一方面储备军用物质供应需要，即是把吸收的消化产物葡萄糖变为肝糖存储起来，到需要的时候再把肝糖变为葡萄糖输送到血里去；一方面高度发挥战斗力量（肝脏中的间质细胞就具有高度的噬菌作用），使细菌失去战斗力，从肝脏中随着胆汁一起流向十二指肠，再从大肠向外排泄出去。
    肾脏也是一个坚固堡垒，在战争中继续执行排泄废物的经常任务，把新陈代谢的产物——尿素、尿酸等排出体外，随着就把进犯的细菌驱逐出境，让它从小便流向外面（伤寒病人的小便中就有伤寒杆菌）。
    最巩固强大的堡垒当然是中央作战指挥部。它是由脑毛细血管的内皮和脑室的脉络丛所构成（脉络丛为软脑膜的折绉结构富于血管），凶暴疯狂的敌人是难以攻入这座特别装置的城堡的。
    不过一般来讲，当细菌进到第三道防线，也就是侵入人体深层组织或攻占某个内脏器官的时候，毛病已经严重，需要外力的支援，要依靠药物的帮助了。
    因此，别以为人体具有杀灭细菌的本能，就可以逍遥自在了。不能，麻痹大意不得，必须在平时积极锻炼身体，养成清洁卫生的习惯，按时进行预防接种，叫细菌无隙可乘，才能使我们有一个健康的身体。
