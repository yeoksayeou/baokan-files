    Visiting Choi Seung-hee

    A little over a month ago, in front of the ticket office of the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang, people lined up every day to buy tickets. This was for the 30th anniversary performance of Choi Seung-hee, a People's Actor of Korea and a famous dancer. Despite the wind and snow, the severe cold could not stop people's respect and love for the outstanding dancer.

    The curtain opened. To the elegant sound of the Gayageum and the spirited sound of the Piri, a woman wearing a red long skirt, a light green short jacket, and a red long drum slung diagonally across her back, walked backwards onto the stage. At first, people only saw her back, and it was not until she retreated to the depths of the stage and danced towards the audience that they could see her face clearly. A burst of warm applause swept through the theater. This was Choi Seung-hee performing her masterpiece - "Long Drum Dance". She smiled, her eyes shining with youth, happiness, and joy, while raising her arms and gently tapping the long drum, dancing lightly, spinning, spinning... The urgent drumbeats added so much masculine tone, and the flowing skirt outlined so many soft colors. She so appropriately expressed the unique beauty of Korean women, healthy and gentle, brave and optimistic.

    The curtain opened again. An old white-haired boatman was sailing on the sea. Although there was no scenery on the stage, people seemed to be in a hurricane-roaring, wave-filled sea, and the old boatman stubbornly fought against the wind and waves. The last ray of red light shone on the stage, the sky cleared, the wind and waves subsided, and the old boatman wiped off a sweat and took off his mask. It turned out that the old boatman was also Choi Seung-hee. For thirty years, Choi Seung-hee has created various beautiful dance images, male, female, old, and young, and she performs each role with extraordinary skill.

    When Choi Seung-hee performed her famous dance drama "Mother of Korea," the audience's emotions soared to the extreme. The audience followed the mother she played in her grief, anger, and hatred because her son was bombed to death by American planes. When the Korean mother joined the guerrillas and finally personally killed the American military officer, thunderous applause erupted throughout the audience. It is said that during the war, some Koreans who watched this dance drama went to the battlefield with tears in their eyes. This dance drama won the Peace Prize and the first prize at the World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival.

    For thirty years, Choi Seung-hee has created and performed more than two hundred dance programs with unique styles, including poetry-like pieces and multi-act, multi-scene dance dramas performed by hundreds of people. This is such a rich harvest in artistic creation. This is the result of Choi Seung-hee's extraordinary dance talent and her many years of hard work. Through programs such as "Chunhyang in Prison" and "People Away from Home" in this performance, people can see the unyielding image of the Korean people under the oppression of the Japanese rulers; through "Old Age, Young Heart" and "Breaking Through the Wind and Waves," they can see the optimistic, brave, and fearless character of the Korean people and many aspects of their lives. The large-scale dance drama "The Story of Sado Castle" depicts the story of the ancient Korean people defeating the invading Japanese pirates and defending their motherland. The dance drama "Under the Clear Sky" summarizes the struggles and life of the Korean people in the ten years since liberation, and especially vividly depicts the situation of the Korean people actively working and rebuilding their motherland after the war. Choi Seung-hee's thirty years of dance activities have expressed the struggles and life, joy and pain of the Korean people; and expressed the character and feelings of the Korean people. She has not only inherited the Korean national dance heritage, absorbed Western dance techniques, and developed Korean national dance, but her dance art also has a high degree of patriotic thought and popularity.

    After watching Choi Seung-hee's anniversary performance, we visited her. We came to a newly built building on a small hillside in Pyongyang, which is the newly built "Choi Seung-hee Dance Theater". The construction of the building has not been fully completed, but the building is already filled with music, and the actors are rehearsing dances in the open space outside the building. Intense artistic activity has already begun. I remember that last year their theater was still in a group of low wooden houses in West Pyongyang, and the environment was much more difficult than it is now. When I visited them, they were also conducting intense rehearsals, and the sound of drums and the sound of stringed instruments wove together a tense atmosphere of battle. Hard work is the most profound impression that this artistic group gives people.

    Choi Seung-hee met with us in her office. She said that in the early days of her dance activities, her desire to study dance was to show the world the excellent national culture and art of Korea and the unyielding character of the Korean people through dance art. At that time, Japan ruled Korea and obliterated everything Korean. She spent a long time going to the people, going to the countryside, and collecting and excavating Korean national dance art from the palace dancers of the Joseon Dynasty, and then organizing and improving it, and creating new dance programs. At this time, she created dances such as "Sword Dance", "Song of Abundance", "Improvisational Dance", "Buddha Statue of Seokguram Grotto", and "Mask Dance", which were performed more than a thousand times in Korea, Japan, and other places, and were welcomed by hundreds of thousands of viewers. The performance of these dances inspired the Korean people's patriotism and national pride. In particular, the dances "People Away from Home" and "Breaking the Chains" that she created and performed directly described the tragic life and struggle of the Korean people under the oppression of Japanese imperialism. The Japanese rulers later banned her from performing these programs. Once, she was arrested for performing "People Away from Home" (describing the situation of Korean people leaving their motherland to go to Northeast China because they could not bear the oppression of the Japanese rulers).

    From 1937 to 1940, she took many of her own dances to tour North and South America and Europe, where she was warmly welcomed. After returning to China, she suffered more persecution from the Japanese rulers, but she continued to fight unyieldingly and persisted in artistic activities.

    Choi Seung-hee is now leading the Choi Seung-hee Dance Theater and also serving as the principal of the Korean National Dance School. Her work is very busy. Talking about the current situation, she said with emotion that only after liberation came to northern Korea did her artistic life enter a new stage. The achievements of the ten years since liberation have greatly exceeded the past twenty years. She emphasized that on the occasion of commemorating the 30th anniversary of her dance activities, her greatest experience is that there is artistic development only with the leadership of the Party and the people's regime. Before liberation, it was difficult to engage in dance art alone in terms of economy and manpower, and she was constantly persecuted. But now, the Party and the government give her strong support, and hundreds of actors and students are engaged in artistic activities with her. Her dream of creating national ballet dramas for many years has been realized, and she has created many dance dramas such as "Mother of Korea", "Midnight Song of Wolseong", "The Story of Sado Castle", and "Under the Clear Sky". She was greatly welcomed when she performed in the Soviet Union and Eastern European brother countries in 1956. At the 6th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival held in Moscow last year, the actors of the Korean Art Theater won more than 20 gold and silver medals. In addition, after liberation, she also completed the organization of the basic movements of Korean dance, which is of great help to educating future generations.

    Choi Seung-hee also talked about her time working in China from 1950 to 1952. She said that she received care and help from the Chinese Party and government, and she expressed her gratitude to the Chinese Party and government and the Chinese people who love Korean dance art.

    Choi Seung-hee has a deep friendship with Chinese artists such as Mei Lanfang and Han Shichang. Mr. Mei Lanfang also sent a handwritten congratulatory message on the occasion of commemorating the 30th anniversary of her dance activities. When she was in Beijing, she helped these friends in the drama world organize the basic movements of dance in Chinese Peking Opera. The Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Class she hosted in Beijing trained more than 100 dance actors from China and Korea. In the dance dramas that Choi Seung-hee created after returning to Korea from China, she also absorbed some Chinese dance movements. She has done a lot of work in cultural exchanges between China and Korea.

    访崔承喜
    一个多月以前，在平壤牡丹峰剧场的售票处前面，买票的人每天都排成了长龙。这是朝鲜人民演员、著名的舞蹈家崔承喜在这里举行舞蹈活动三十周年的纪念公演。尽管刮着风，下着雪，但严寒的天气挡不住人们对杰出的舞蹈家的尊敬和热爱的心情。
    幕开了。在优雅的伽倻琴和泼辣的筚篥声中，一个穿着红色长裙、淡绿短袄、斜背着一个红色的长鼓的妇女，倒退着出场了。开始人们只看见一个背影，一直等到她退到舞台的深处迎着观众舞来时，观众才看清楚她的面影。一阵热烈的掌声卷过剧场，这就是崔承喜在表演她的名作——“长鼓舞”。她微笑着，眼睛里闪耀着青春、幸福和欢乐的光芒，一面高扬起手臂轻拍着长鼓，一面轻盈地舞着，旋转着，旋转着……激切的鼓声增加了多少刚健的调子，飘洒的长裙又描出了多少柔和的色彩。她是那么恰如其分地表现了朝鲜妇女特有的美，健康而温柔，勇敢又乐观。
    幕又开了。一个白发苍苍的老船夫，摇着船在海上航行，虽然台上没有布景，但是人们仿佛置身于一个飓风怒号、波浪滔天的大海上，老船夫顽强地同风浪搏斗着。最后一抹红光照到台上，天晴了，风平浪静了，老船夫挥一把汗拿下了假面具，原来老船夫也就是崔承喜。三十年来，崔承喜创造了各种美丽的舞蹈形象，男、女、老、少，她无论表演哪一种角色无不出神入化。
    当崔承喜演出她的著名舞剧“朝鲜的母亲”时，观众的情绪高涨到极点。观众随着她所扮演的母亲因儿子被美机炸死而悲伤、愤怒、仇恨。当朝鲜的母亲参加了游击队，最后亲手打死美军军官时，全场爆发出雷一般的掌声。据说，在战时有的朝鲜人看了这个舞剧后就含着泪走上战场。这个舞剧曾在世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节上获得了和平奖和一等奖。
    三十年来，崔承喜创作和演出了独具风格的二百多个舞蹈节目，其中有诗一般的小品，也有多幕多场上百人演出的舞剧。这是多么丰盛的艺术创造上的收获。这是崔承喜非凡的舞蹈天才和她长年来辛勤劳动的结晶。通过这次公演的“狱中春香”、“背井离乡的人们”等节目，人们可以看到朝鲜人民在日本统治者的压迫下不屈的形象；通过“人老心不老”、“冲破风浪”，可以看到朝鲜人民乐观、勇敢、不怕困难的性格和许多生活情趣。大型舞剧“沙道城的故事”表现了古代朝鲜人民打败入侵的倭寇和保卫祖国的故事。舞剧“在晴朗的天空下”则概括了朝鲜解放后十多年来的斗争和生活，特别是以鲜明的形象表现了朝鲜人民战后积极劳动、重建祖国的情形。崔承喜三十年来的舞蹈活动，表达了朝鲜人民的斗争和生活，欢乐和痛苦；表达了朝鲜人民的性格和感情。她不仅继承了朝鲜的民族舞蹈遗产，吸收了西方舞蹈技术，发展了朝鲜的民族舞蹈，而且她的舞蹈艺术，具有高度的爱国主义思想和人民性。
    在看了崔承喜的纪念公演以后，我们去访问了她。我们来到平壤市内小山坡上一座新落成的大楼里，这就是新建成的“崔承喜舞蹈剧场”。大楼的建筑工程还没有全部完成，可是楼内已乐声盈耳，楼外的空地上，演员们已在紧张地排练舞蹈，紧张的艺术活动早已开始了。记得去年他们的剧场还在西平壤的一组低矮的木屋里，环境比现在艰苦得多，我去访问他们时，他们也是正在进行紧张的排练，咚咚的鼓声和咿哑的琴声织成了一片战斗的紧张气氛。辛勤劳动是这个艺术团体给人最深刻的印象。
    崔承喜在她的办公室里会见了我们，她说，在她从事舞蹈活动的初期，自己研究舞蹈的愿望是通过舞蹈艺术来向全世界人民显示朝鲜优秀的民族文化艺术和朝鲜人民不屈的性格，那时日本统治着朝鲜，把朝鲜的一切都抹煞了。她曾用很长的时间到人民中去，到农村中去，向李朝时代的宫中舞女们搜集发掘朝鲜的民族舞蹈艺术，然后加以整理和提高，并创作新的舞蹈节目。这时她创作了“剑舞”、“丰年之歌”、“即兴舞”、“石窟庵的佛像”、“假面舞”等舞蹈，在朝鲜、日本等地演出了一千多次，受到了数十万观众的欢迎。这些舞蹈的演出，启发了朝鲜人民的爱国心和民族自豪感。特别是她创作和演出的“背井离乡的人们”、“扭断锁链”等舞蹈，更直接描写了朝鲜人民在日本帝国主义的压迫下悲惨的生活和斗争。日本统治者后来禁止她演这些节目，有一次因为她演出“背井离乡的人们”（描述朝鲜人民因不堪日本统治者的压迫离开祖国前往中国的东北的情形）而被逮捕。
    1937年到1940年间，她带着自己创作的许多舞蹈到南北美洲和欧洲等许多国家进行巡回演出，受到了热烈的欢迎。她回国后遭到了日本统治者更多的迫害，但她一直不屈地进行斗争，坚持进行艺术活动。
    崔承喜现在一面领导着崔承喜舞蹈剧场，一面还兼任朝鲜国立舞蹈学校的校长，她的工作是很忙的。谈到目前的情况，她感慨地说，只有在解放后来到了朝鲜北部，我的艺术生活才进入了一个新的阶段，解放后十年来的成就大大地超过了过去二十年。她强调说，在纪念她的舞蹈活动三十周年的时候，她最大的体会就是有了党和人民政权的领导才有艺术的发展。在解放前，一个人搞舞蹈艺术，经济、人力处处都是困难，还不断遭到迫害。可是现在，党和政府给她大力的支持，有好几百名演员和学生同她一起搞艺术活动，她多年来创作民族的芭蕾舞剧的梦想实现了，创作了“朝鲜的母亲”、“半夜月城曲”、“沙道城的故事”、“在晴朗的天空下”等许多舞剧，1956年到苏联和东欧兄弟国家演出时受到了很大的欢迎。去年在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节上，朝鲜艺术剧场的演员们获得了二十多枚金质的和银质的奖章。另外，在解放后，她还完成了朝鲜舞蹈基本动作的整理，这对教育后进有很大的帮助。
    崔承喜还谈到了1950年到1952年她在中国工作的时期，她说那时得到了中国的党和政府的关怀和帮助，她向中国的党和政府以及热爱朝鲜舞蹈艺术的中国人民表示感谢。
    崔承喜同梅兰芳、韩世昌等中国艺术家有着深厚的友谊，这次纪念她的舞蹈活动三十周年，梅兰芳先生还送来了亲笔写的贺词。她在北京时曾帮助这些戏剧界的朋友整理了中国京剧中的舞蹈的基本动作。她在北京主办的崔承喜舞蹈研究班培养了一百多名中朝两国的舞蹈演员。崔承喜从中国回朝鲜后创作的舞剧中，也吸收了一些中国舞蹈的动作。她对中朝文化交流作了不少工作。
