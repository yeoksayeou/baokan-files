Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 2nd January: The construction project of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex will enter a peak construction period this year. According to the state plan, the first automated large blast furnace, coking plant, and iron mine of this iron and steel complex will all begin construction this year. Around these main projects, dozens of other projects will also be successively constructed this year. This year, the investment in this iron and steel complex will more than double compared to last year.

In the past five years, Baotou Steel has completed various preparations for large-scale construction. In the Baotou Steel factory area, the metal structure, machine repair, cast iron, cast steel, and forging workshops that started construction last year are undergoing winter construction. Factory buildings and frameworks have formed a construction complex on the grassland. These workshops form the machine repair area of Baotou Steel and will be responsible for the mechanical maintenance and repair of the steelmaking, ironmaking, and other production systems in the future. Some enterprises will be put into production this year and will also serve the construction projects. The factory site leveling project for the ironmaking plant, coking plant, etc. is also underway. The railway connecting the iron mine and the Baolan Railway has passed through the construction base and entered the factory construction site. The water pipeline of the Baiyun Obo iron mine was put into operation last year. The mine railway, ore crushing plant earthwork project, mine industrial site, and miners' living area are all under construction.

Around the factory area, the urban-scale Baotou Steel living area and modern construction base have appeared. On a barren wasteland three years ago, there are now streets and houses. The steel bar processing plant, timber processing plant, reinforced concrete prefabrication plant, automobile base, and mechanized supply station on the construction base have all been put into production either entirely or partially, making preparations for the large-scale construction of Baotou Steel.

With the help of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of Chinese and Soviet technicians, the preliminary design of Baotou Steel has been completed, and the technical design and construction drawings have also been partially completed. Domestic scientific research units and brother factories have also helped Baotou Steel conduct scientific and industrial tests on various projects of ore.

    大规模施工准备工作完成
    包钢进入建设高峰年
    新华社包头2日电　包头钢铁联合企业的建设工程今年起进入建设高峰年代。按照国家计划，这个钢铁联合企业的第一座自动化大型高炉、焦化厂和铁矿山等工程都在今年开工；围绕这些主体工程，还有数十个工程将在今年陆续施工。今年，这个钢铁联合企业的投资比去年增加了一倍多。
    在过去的五年中，包钢已经完成了大规模施工的各项准备工作。在包钢厂区，去年开工的金属结构、机修、铸铁、铸钢、锻造等车间，正进行冬季施工，厂房、房架已在草原上形成了一片建筑群。这些车间组成包钢的机修区，将来担任炼钢、炼铁等生产系统的机械维护和修理工作。有些企业在今年投入生产后，还将为建设工程服务。炼铁厂、焦化厂等的厂地平整工程也在进行，连接铁矿山和包兰线的铁路，已通过建筑基地进入厂区工地。白云鄂博铁矿山的输水管线已在去年通水，矿山铁路、矿石破碎厂土方工程和矿山工业场地以及矿工生活区，都正在建设。
    厂区的周围，出现了城市规模的包钢生活区和现代化的建筑基地。在三年前的一片荒原上，现在已是街道纵横、房屋林立。建筑基地上的钢筋加工厂、木材加工厂、钢筋混凝土预制品厂、汽车基地、机械化供应站等生产企业，都已全部或部分投入生产，为包钢大规模施工做好了准备。
    在苏联的帮助和中苏两国技术人员合作下，包钢的初步设计已经完成，技术设计和施工图纸也完成了一部分。国内的科学研究单位和兄弟厂，还帮助包钢进行了矿石的多种项目的科学试验和工业试验。
