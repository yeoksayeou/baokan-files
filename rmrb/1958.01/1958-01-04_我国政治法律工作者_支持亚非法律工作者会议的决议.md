Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd – The Standing Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society held a meeting this afternoon, listened to the report by Tao Xijin, head of the Chinese legal workers delegation, on attending the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference, and passed a resolution strongly supporting the various resolutions made by the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference. It also called on political and legal workers across the country to work together with peace-loving and democratic legal workers around the world to realize these resolutions.

Tao Xijin said in his report that the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference was held in Damascus, the capital of Syria, from November 7th to 11th, 1957. It was the first time that legal workers from Asian and African countries had gathered together to discuss issues of common concern to the people of the two continents. This was a matter of great historical significance.

Tao Xijin said that the results of the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference showed that although the representatives of the participating countries came from regions with different political situations and countries with different social systems, and had various different political views and legal viewpoints, they were united on the general goal of striving for peace and justice. The conference passed many important resolutions on world peace, military alliances and bases, which profoundly reflected the new development of friendly cooperation between the people of Asia and Africa since the Bandung Conference, further clarified the various principles of the Bandung Conference from a legal perspective, expressed the lofty will of the people of Asia and Africa to pursue peace and justice, and specifically and powerfully supported the current struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against imperialism and colonialism.

Tao Xijin then talked about the characteristics of the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference. He said that one profound impression the conference gave us was that it put forward the unusually clear slogan of opposing imperialism and colonialism, reflecting the new development in the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa to defend peace and justice. He said that the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference believes that imperialism and colonialism are the enemies of peace and justice and the source of all crimes (war, massacre, torture, strangling nationalism, and enslaving people, etc.); and emphasized that imperialism and colonialism themselves are a crime, a constant aggression and oppression against all nations and all people. Such condemnation by legal workers is, in fact, a just trial of imperialists and colonialists. He also said that another profound impression the conference gave us was that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, initiated by China and India and affirmed by the Bandung Conference, have become generally recognized new principles of international law and have become an important weapon for the people of all countries to strive for peace and oppose aggression. The central guiding ideology of this Asian-African Lawyers' Conference was the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Tao Xijin said that among the international friends we came into contact with, some were internationally renowned jurists who had experienced the two world wars. They sincerely said that in participating in the great struggle for peace and justice, they increasingly felt that the old traditional international law, although many of its principles could still be applied, had many concepts that had to be abandoned and replaced by new principles of international law. For example, the old international law on the issue of sovereignty actually safeguarded the sovereignty of capitalist powers while disregarding the sovereignty of weak countries and the right to national self-determination. Regarding the issue of treaties, the old international law recognized the validity of unequal treaties, which was obviously unreasonable. Regarding the issue of war, the old international law did not distinguish between just and unjust wars, and therefore, in essence, it served imperialist aggression. Obviously, these stale concepts must be replaced by new content such as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in order to meet the requirements of the current era.

Tao Xijin finally said that the task facing all legal workers in Asian and African countries and other countries in the world who cherish peace and justice is mainly to defend and clarify the various principles that conform to peaceful coexistence from a legal perspective, support the freedom and independence of all nations, oppose and stop the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and their colonial policies, and safeguard lasting world peace. Tao Xijin said that in order to accomplish such a task, legal workers from all countries in the world must have further unity and cooperation.

After discussion, the Standing Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society expressed satisfaction with Tao Xijin's report and the work of the Chinese legal workers delegation, and expressed warm congratulations on the major achievements of the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference.

Tao Xijin also spoke at the meeting about the participation of the Chinese legal workers delegation in the Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Moscow in November 1957. The Standing Committee meeting of the Political Science and Law Society then passed a letter to Pritt, Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and Norman, Secretary-General, expressing agreement with the policies determined by the Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers regarding further expanding association affairs activities in the future and specific measures related to strengthening academic exchanges.

    我国政治法律工作者
    支持亚非法律工作者会议的决议
    据新华社2日讯　中国政治法律学会常务理事会今天下午举行会议，听取了中国法律工作者代表团团长陶希晋关于出席亚非法律工作者会议的情况报告，并且通过决议，坚决支持亚非法律工作者会议所作的各项决议，并且号召全国的政治法律工作者，同全世界爱好和平民主的法律工作者一起为实现这些决议而共同努力。
    陶希晋在报告中说，亚非法律工作者会议是1957年11月7日到11日在叙利亚首都大马士革举行的。亚非各国法律工作者这样的聚会一堂，来讨论两洲人民共同关切的问题，还是第一次。这是一件具有重大历史意义的事情。
      陶希晋说，亚非法律工作者会议的结果表明，与会各国代表，虽然都来自不同政治情况的地域和不同社会制度的国家，具有各种不同的政治见解和法律观点，但是在争取和平与正义的总目标上是一致的。这次会议通过了关于世界和平、关于军事联盟和基地等许多重要决议，深刻地反映了万隆会议以来亚非人民友好合作的新发展，从法律方面进一步阐明了万隆会议的各项原则，表达了亚非人民追求和平与正义的崇高意志，并且具体地、有力地支持了亚非各国人民当前反对帝国主义与殖民主义的斗争。
    陶希晋接着又谈到了亚非法律工作者会议的特点。他说，这次会议给予我们一个深刻的印象是：它提出了异常鲜明的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的口号，反映了亚非人民捍卫和平与正义的斗争已有了新的发展。他说，亚非法律工作者会议认为，帝国主义和殖民主义是和平与正义的敌人，是各种罪行（战争、屠杀、酷刑、扼杀民族主义与奴役人民等）的渊源；而且强调地指出，帝国主义和殖民主义本身就是一种犯罪行为，就是对各民族和所有人民群众经常的侵略与压迫。法律工作者们这样的谴责，实际上也就是对帝国主义和殖民主义者的一种正义的审判。他又说，这次会议给予我们另一个深刻的印象是：中印两国所倡议而又被万隆会议所肯定的关于和平共处的五项原则，已经成为公认的新的国际法原则，已经成为各国人民争取和平、反对侵略的重要武器。这次亚非法律工作者会议的中心指导思想，就是和平共处的五项原则。
    陶希晋说，在同我们接触过的国际朋友当中，有些是经历了两次世界大战的国际上的著名法学家，他们诚挚地说到，在参与为和平与正义的伟大的斗争中，越来越感到旧的传统的国际法，其中虽有不少原则还可以适用，但有许多概念已必须抛弃而代之以新的国际法原则。例如，旧的国际法对有关主权问题，实际上是维护资本主义强国的主权，而是蔑视弱小国家的主权和民族自决的权利的。关于条约问题，旧的国际法承认不平等条约有效，这显然是不合理的。关于战争问题，旧的国际法不区别正义与非正义的战争，因而在本质上它是为帝国主义侵略服务的。显然，这些陈腐的概念，已必须要用如像和平共处五项原则的新内容来代替，才能符合现时代的要求。
    陶希晋最后说，摆在亚非各国以及世界其他各国的一切珍视和平与正义的法律工作者面前的任务，主要是从法律方面捍卫与阐明符合和平共处的各项原则，支持一切民族的自由和独立，反对和制止帝国主义者的侵略阴谋及其奉行的殖民主义政策，维护世界持久和平。陶希晋说，为了要完成这样的任务，世界各国法律工作者必须有进一步的团结和合作。
    中国政治法律学会常务理事会会议经过讨论，对陶希晋的报告和中国法律工作者代表团的工作表示满意，对亚非法律工作者会议所取得的重大成就表示热烈的祝贺。
    陶希晋在会上还谈到了中国法律工作者代表团1957年11月在莫斯科参加国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议的情况。政法学会常务理事会会议接着通过了给国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特、总书记诺尔曼的一封信，表示同意这次国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议所确定的关于今后进一步扩大会务活动的方针和有关加强学术交流等的具体措施。
