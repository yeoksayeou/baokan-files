Husband and Wife Participate in Labor Training Together

Among the more than 2,000 cadres from Jiangsu Provincial government who went to the countryside to become farmers, there was a young couple who brought their family to the Tianhua’an Agricultural Cooperative. This couple are both Communist Party members. The husband, Gu Shangen, and the wife, Gao Wenying, both grew up in the city and are “three-door” cadres (out of the house door, into the school door, into the office door), who have never done any labor. This time, when the Party called on cadres to “go down to the countryside and up to the mountains,” they actively strove to be sent down and persuaded their mother to live in the countryside with them, to train themselves in actual physical labor, and to contribute their share to building a new socialist countryside.

As soon as Gu Shangen arrived at the Tianhua’an Agricultural Cooperative, he carried out "basic construction" – buying an iron rake. Old commune member Qian Houchang took the iron rake and used a knife to shave off the bamboo knots. He said, "This way it won't rub your hands raw when you use it."

The new work began. Gu Shangen (second from the right) participated in the cooperative's manure accumulation campaign – digging pond mud. This work, for intellectuals who have never labored, is not simple. Gu Shangen dug for a long time and didn't dig up a shovel of mud. Production team leader Wei Guozhong (second from the left) corrected his operating method.

Gu Shangen’s wife, Gao Wenying (center), was a very skilled typist in the office. This time, when she went down to the fields, it was like when she first learned to type, and everything was not going smoothly. But it doesn't matter, commune members Jin Qinnan (left) and Qian Xingjuan (right) will help her well.

Although Gu Shangen's family has never lived in the countryside, they quickly got used to it.

    夫妻双双参加劳动锻炼
    江苏省级机关下乡当农民的二千多名干部中，有一对年青夫妇，带着家属来到天花庵农业社。这一对夫妇都是共产党员，丈夫顾善根、妻子高文英都是在城市长大的“三门”干部（出家门、进学校门、进机关门），从来没有劳动过。这次党号召干部“下乡上山”，他们夫妇便积极争取下放，并说服了母亲一同到农村来居住，在实际体力劳动中锻炼自己，并为建设社会主义新农村献出自己的一分力量。

    顾善根一到天花庵农业社就进行“基本建设”——购买了铁耙。老社员钱厚生接过铁耙就用刀把竹节削掉。他说：“这样使用起来才不会把手磨破。”
    新的工作开始了。顾善根（右第二人）参加了社里的积肥运动——挖塘泥。这个工作，对从来没有劳动过的知识分子来说却很不简单，顾善根挖了好久，一锹泥也没有挖上来，生产队长卫国忠（左第二人）纠正了他的操作方法。
    顾善根的妻子高文英（中）在机关里原是一个很熟练的打字员。这次下到地里，又像她初学打字时，处处不能得心应手了。但不要紧，社员金琴南（左）和钱星娟（右）会很好地帮助她的。
    顾善根一家，虽然没有在农村住过，但很快他们便习惯了。
