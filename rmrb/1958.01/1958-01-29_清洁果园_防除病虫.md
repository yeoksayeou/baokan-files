    Cleaning orchards, fertilizing, and pruning are three important tasks to ensure increased fruit tree production. All three of these tasks need to be carried out gradually starting now. Doing these jobs well will better guarantee increased fruit tree production this year.
    The first task that should be undertaken now is cleaning the orchard and carrying out winter pest and disease control. Pathogens and pests that harm fruit trees all enter a dormant state in winter. Therefore, winter is a favorable time to control fruit tree pests and diseases. In particular, for apple anthracnose, citrus canker, etc., it is necessary to clean the orchard in winter, remove dry branches, diseased fruits, diseased branches, and diseased leaves, and then spray agents during the growing season to achieve better results. The pear fruit borer has a long occurrence time, and it is not easy to seize favorable opportunities by using agents alone, so it should be combined with winter removal of pest buds and early spring removal of infested fruits for prevention and control. From this, it can be seen that if the orchard can be thoroughly cleaned in winter, and then agents and manual control can be carried out during the growing season, the harm of pests and diseases can be eliminated. Due to the comprehensive implementation of winter orchard cleaning work year after year in the citrus orchards of Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, the occurrence of pests and diseases has been greatly reduced.
    Generally, pathogens and pests mostly overwinter in dead branches, fallen leaves, diseased fruits, and weeds. Winter orchard cleaning work should be targeted at the overwintering habits of these pathogens and pests, removing weeds, fallen leaves, and diseased fruits from the orchard; pruning dead branches, smoothing out moldy trunks, scraping off moss, rough bark, and peeling bark from the tree trunks, etc. Although winter cleaning of the orchard is relatively simple and easy, it must be done carefully and comprehensively, and the swept weeds, dead branches, fallen leaves, diseased fruits, rough bark, etc. must be collected and burned.
    The second task is to carry out timely and meticulous fruit tree pruning and shaping. Most apple-producing areas and many citrus and pear-producing areas have pruning habits. There is a lot of agricultural work in the spring. Agricultural cooperatives with fruit trees should prioritize the various tasks and organize technically skilled members as soon as possible to study pruning techniques and carry out pruning work. Otherwise, delaying too late will affect the effectiveness of the pruning work. Fruit tree pruning is a very meticulous crown management task, and it should not be pruned too lightly or "pulled and cut" excessively. Pruning fruit trees can promote fruit tree growth and development. Deli Temple Agricultural Cooperative in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, and Huijiang Agricultural Cooperative and Xialing Agricultural Cooperative in Huangyan, Zhejiang Province, have all increased production year after year due to reasonable and meticulous pruning combined with other agricultural technologies.
    The third thing that should be done now is to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer for the orchard. Applying base fertilizer can ensure the needs of fruit trees for year-round growth and development. Production units that have not yet carried out autumn fertilization or have insufficient fertilization should supplement it in the spring. At present, a winter fertilizer accumulation campaign is being carried out everywhere. Agricultural cooperatives with fruit trees should arrange the base fertilizer needed for orchards as early as possible.
    The time for planting fruit tree seedlings is also approaching. Agricultural cooperatives should also seize the time to prepare for planting, such as planning new orchards, deep plowing, digging tree pits, and leveling the land.

### 清洁果园　防除病虫

    清洁果园　防除病虫
    防治病虫害、施肥、修剪是保证果树增产的三件重要工作。这三件工作，都需从现在起陆续进行。作好这些工作，今年的果树增产就更有保证了。
    当前应该进行的第一件工作是清洁果园，开展冬季的病虫害防治工作。为害果树的病菌和害虫在冬季都进入休眠状态。所以冬季是防治果树病虫害的有利时期。特别是苹果炭疽病、柑桔溃疡病等，必须在冬季清洁果园，摘除干枝、病果、病枝和病叶，然后在生长期间再喷射药剂，才能取得较好的效果。梨大食心虫发生时间很长，单用药剂防治，不容易抓住有利时机，因此应当结合冬季摘除虫芽和春季早?虫果进行防治。由此可见，如果能在冬季彻底清洁果园，再在生长期间进行药剂和人工防治，才能消灭病虫的为害。广东省潮安县的柑桔园由于连年全面开展冬季清园工作，病虫的发生就大大减少了。
    一般的病菌、害虫多在枯枝、落叶、病果、杂草中潜藏越冬。冬季清园工作要针对这些病菌害虫的越冬习性，清除果园中的杂草、落叶和病果；剪除枯枝、剔平霉椿、刮除树干上的苔藓、粗皮、翘皮等。冬季清洁果园，虽然比较简单容易，但是必须做得细致全面，清扫的杂草、枯枝、落叶、病果、粗皮等要集中烧毁。
    第二件工作是：及时细致地开展果树整枝修剪工作。大部分苹果产区和许多柑桔和梨的产区，都有修剪习惯。春季农业方面的工作很多，有果树的农业社应该把各项工作进行排队，及早组织有技术的社员研究修剪技术，开展修剪工作。否则，拖的太晚，将会影响修剪工作的效果。果树修剪是一件很细致的树冠管理工作，既不能修剪过轻，又不能“大拉大砍”。对果树修剪，可以促使果树生长发育。辽宁省复县得利寺农业社，浙江黄岩汇江农业社、下凌农业社都是由于进行了合理细致的修剪，并结合其他农业技术而年年增产。
    为果园大量积肥，是当前应当作的第三件事情。施用基肥可以保证果树周年生长发育的需要。还没有进行秋季施肥或施肥不足的生产单位，应当在春季进行补施。目前各地正在开展冬季积肥的运动。有果树的农业社，应该早些安排果园需用的基肥。
    栽植果树苗的时期也快要到来，各农业社还应当抓紧时间，作好新辟果园的规划、深耕、挖树穴、整地等栽植准备工作。
