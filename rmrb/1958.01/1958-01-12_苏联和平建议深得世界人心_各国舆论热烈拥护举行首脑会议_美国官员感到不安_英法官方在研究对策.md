Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet government's new proposals for holding a summit conference of various countries and easing international tensions have aroused strong reactions in various countries around the world.

East German newspapers support the Soviet government's proposal to ease international tensions. "Neues Deutschland" pointed out: Ending the Cold War and expanding international cooperation will help solve the German problem on the basis of mutual rapprochement between the two sovereign German states - the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Hungarian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Gurós, said at a press conference on the 10th that the Hungarian government welcomes the convening of a summit conference of Eastern and Western countries and believes that holding such a conference would be very beneficial. The Hungarian government has consistently strived to ease international tensions, and therefore, it supports any proposals in this regard.

Bulganin's letters to the United States, Britain, and other countries regarding the proposal to hold a summit conference of heads of government have been warmly welcomed in New Delhi, the capital of India. All major newspapers published the news on the front page with large headlines such as "Bulganin's Peace Proposals." Many newspapers especially emphasized that India and Egypt were also proposed to participate in such high-level talks.

The French cabinet held a five-hour meeting on the afternoon of the 10th, at which it specifically studied what attitude France should take when holding top-level talks with the Soviet Union. The results of the study have not been revealed to the outside world.

The British public has reacted favorably to this latest Soviet initiative.

Tom Hubbard, chairman of the Scottish Nationalist Party parliamentary group, said, "The sincerity of Bulganin's proposal is beyond doubt. Regardless of how the numbers are counted in the House of Commons, the vast majority of people in the country will fully support Bulganin's proposal to hold a summit conference."

British newspapers across the country reported Bulganin's letter to Macmillan in prominent positions. The "Yorkshire Post" called in an editorial for Western countries to strive to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, as such an agreement would help "maintain peace and stop the devastating arms race." Public pressure is so strong that even Foreign Secretary Lloyd, when speaking to his constituents in Ellesmere Port on the 10th, had to say that the proposal to hold a summit conference in two or three months needed to be carefully considered.

He said that Britain hopes to truly live in peace with the Soviet Union. "We are willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union at any time." Lloyd believed that the best way to make progress in the new year would be: First, try to avoid open mutual accusations; second, try to increase people-to-people contacts, such as exchanging students and tourists; third, try to increase trade; fourth, try to reach mutually acceptable agreements on some specific issues.

A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 10th that the letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin to British Prime Minister Macmillan, which was delivered on the evening of the 9th, "needs very careful study." It is reported that British Foreign Office officials and experts are conducting an "urgent study" of the letter on the 10th.

The West German government is very uneasy about the new peace initiative proposed by the Soviet Union. West German government spokesman Eckardt clearly stated at a press conference held in Bonn on the 10th that the Soviet proposal is not suitable for the West German government because the West German government intends to continue to pursue its military expansion plan.

However, SPD Chairman Ollenhauer and FDP Vice Chairman Mende both believe that the Soviet proposal should be carefully and earnestly studied.

The US "Christian Science Monitor" pointed out in an editorial that the United States "risks losing touch with a large segment of world public opinion" if it "rejects Bulganin's proposal for high-level talks." The newspaper said: "If the State Department cannot come up with any meaningful new proposals, then why can't it affirmatively emphasize its readiness to negotiate in its note?"

The newspaper concluded that, given the current U.S. position on East-West negotiations, "world public opinion will get the impression that the Soviet Union is proposing to study peaceful consultation, while the United States is rejecting it."

White House Press Secretary Hagerty announced on the 10th that U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles briefly and preliminarily discussed the Soviet government's proposal on easing international tensions on the morning of the 10th. Hagerty also said that Eisenhower intends to give the proposal "the utmost attention" and has instructed the State Department to give it "careful study."

Hagerty declined to reveal what attitude the U.S. government will take toward the Soviet proposal. However, the same day, Associated Press reporter Hightower reported: "There is no indication in the White House and the State Department that the United States intends to change its basic policy of opposing new high-level talks under the current circumstances." At the same time, Hightower said that Washington officials are concerned that the Soviet proposal may "stir up new hope in Western Europe that something can now be done to avert the danger of a devastating nuclear war."

    苏联和平建议深得世界人心
    各国舆论热烈拥护举行首脑会议
    美国官员感到不安　英法官方在研究对策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联政府关于举行各国首脑会议、缓和国际紧张局势的新建议，在世界各国引起了强烈反应。
    民主德国报纸拥护苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议。“新德意志报”指出：结束冷战和扩大国际合作，将有助于在两个德意志主权国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间相互接近的基础上解决德国问题。
    匈牙利外交部发言人古阿罗什10日在记者招待会上说，匈牙利政府欢迎召开东西方国家的首脑会议，并且认为举行这样的会议是很有益处的。匈牙利政府一贯努力促使国际紧张局势缓和，因此，它支持有关这方面的任何建议。
    布尔加宁向美国、英国等国发出的关于建议举行各国政府首脑会议的信在印度首都新德里受到热烈的欢迎。各主要报纸都在第一版以“布尔加宁的和平建议”等大字标题登载了这一消息。许多报纸特别强调指出，印度和埃及也被建议参加这种高级会谈。
    法国内阁10日下午举行了一次历时五小时的会议，会上特别研究了在同苏联举行最高级会谈时法国应该采取什么态度的问题。研究结果没有向外界透露。
    英国各界公众对苏联这个最新的倡议有了赞同的反应。
    苏格兰国民党议会党团主席汤姆·哈伯德说，“布尔加宁提出的建议的诚意是毫无疑问的。不论在下议院里怎样点人数，国内绝大多数人民将充分支持布尔加宁提出的举行最高级会议的建议。”
    英国各地报纸在显著地位报道了布尔加宁给麦克米伦的信件。“约克郡邮报”在社论中呼吁西方国家努力同苏联达成协议，因为这种协议会有助于“维护和平，停止毁灭性的军备竞赛”。公众的压力非常强大，甚至外交大臣劳埃德10日在伊莱斯默尔港向他的选民讲话时也不得不说，在两三个月内举行最高级会议的建议需要予以慎重考虑。
    他说，英国希望真正和苏联和平相处。“我们愿意在任何时候和苏联进行谈判”。劳埃德认为在新的一年内取得进展的最好的办法将是：一、设法避免公开的相互指责；二、设法增加人员的接触，像交换留学生和游客等；三、设法增加贸易；四、设法在一些具体问题上达成为双方所能接受的协议。
    英国外交部的一个发言人10日说：9日晚间送来的苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给英国首相麦克米伦的信件“需要非常仔细的研究”。据报道：英国外交部的官员和专家们10日正在对这封信进行“紧急的研究”。
    西德政府对苏联所提出的新的和平倡议感到非常不安。西德政府发言人埃卡特10日在波恩举行的记者招待会上明白表示，苏联的建议对西德政府不适合，因为西德政府打算继续推行它的扩军计划。
    但是西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔和自由民主党副主席蒙德都认为应该对苏联建议进行仔细的和认真的研究。
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”在社论中指出，美国“拒绝布尔加宁关于高级会谈的建议就会有脱离世界很大一部分公众”的危险。报纸说：“如果国务院不能提出什么有意义的新建议，那么为什么它在照会中不能肯定地强调准备谈判呢？”
    报纸最后说，由于目前美国在东西方谈判问题上的立场，“世界公众就会产生一种印象，认为苏联建议研究和平协商问题，而美国却加以拒绝”。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂10日宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯在10日早上简单地初步讨论了苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议。哈格蒂还说，艾森豪威尔打算对这个建议给以“极大的注意”，并且已经指示国务院予以“仔细研究”。
    哈格蒂不肯透露美国政府对苏联这个建议将采取什么态度。但是，同一天美联社记者海托华报道说：“在白宫和国务院，并没有迹象表明美国打算改变它反对在目前情况下举行新的高级会谈的基本政策。”同时海托华说，华盛顿的官员们担心苏联的建议可能在西欧“激起新的希望，认为现在可以做一些事情来排除一场毁灭性的核战争的危险”。
