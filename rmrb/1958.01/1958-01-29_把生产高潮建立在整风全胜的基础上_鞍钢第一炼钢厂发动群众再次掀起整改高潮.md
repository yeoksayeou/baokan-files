Anshan, January 28th (Special dispatch from our newspaper by Xinhua News Agency) - Anshan Iron and Steel's First Steel Plant is correcting the tendency of focusing solely on the production upsurge and the work of transferring cadres downwards, while relaxing the continued and in-depth rectification. It is taking various effective measures to re-mobilize the masses to launch another upsurge of rectification.

The First Steel Plant's rectification campaign was launched relatively early and done relatively well, with 85% of the opinions expressed by the workers quickly resolved. Some people then felt that it was almost over. At the end of last year, the factory's main leadership force completely shifted to welcoming the production upsurge and the work of transferring cadres downwards, neglecting further in-depth rectification. This "single-minded" approach led to two unfavorable situations in the rectification work: First, about 10% of the problems were not thoroughly rectified; Second, some of the problems that were resolved deteriorated again because timely measures were not taken to consolidate them. There were still many problems in leadership style and production management.

In mid-January, the factory discovered this deviation, and the factory director and Party committee secretary personally took various approaches to launch a second large-scale mass rectification upsurge. They first summarized the more than 8,000 opinions raised by the masses and organized worker representatives to verify them one by one. Problems that were not rectified well or thoroughly were urged to be quickly rectified by the relevant personnel using big-character posters. Leading cadres also used individual conversations and door-to-door visits to seek the opinions of those who made suggestions on the rectification; anonymous proposals were also not ignored. Thus, individuals rectified their own problems; everyone rectified common problems; and problems that were not thoroughly rectified or deteriorated after rectification were re-rectified. In just five days, about 10% of the false figures in the past rectification were eliminated. Even problems that workers had raised for several years without resolution were solved this time.

This rectification review was conducted in conjunction with publicizing the current situation and tasks, which greatly encouraged the masses' production enthusiasm. The factory has set a target of increasing steel production by 50,000 tons for the whole year. In recent days, the competition between open-hearth furnaces has been very heated, and new records have been constantly emerging. Even No. 8 open-hearth furnace, which has older equipment and whose melting time used to be generally more than nine hours, has recently set four new records in a row, with the last time taking only six hours and two minutes to smelt a furnace of steel.

### 把生产高潮建立在整风全胜的基础上  鞍钢第一炼钢厂发动群众再次掀起整改高潮

    把生产高潮建立在整风全胜的基础上
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂发动群众再次掀起整改高潮
    本报特约新华社鞍山28日电　鞍钢第一炼钢厂纠正单抓生产高潮和下放干部工作，而放松继续深入整改的偏向，采取多种有效措施，重新发动群众掀起整改高潮。
    第一炼钢厂的整风运动搞得较早较好，职工鸣放的意见，很快解决了85％。有些人便认为差不多了。去年末，工厂的主要领导力量就全部转移到迎接生产高潮和下放干部工作方面，忽视了进一步深入整改。这种“单打一”的作法，使整改工作出现了两种不好的情况：一、大约10％左右的问题改得不彻底；二、部分解决了的问题，因没有及时采取巩固措施，情况又变坏了。领导作风和生产管理方面仍有不少问题。
    本月中旬，这个厂发现了这个偏向，厂长和党委书记便亲自动手采取多种方式，发动了第二次声势浩大的群众性整改高潮。他们首先归纳了群众提出的八千多条意见，组织职工代表，逐条核对。改得不好不彻底的，用大字报督促有关人员迅速改。领导干部们还用个别谈话和登门拜访的办法，找提意见人征求对整改的意见；对无名提案也不忽视。于是，个人的问题个人改；大家的问题大家改；改得不彻底或改后又坏了的问题重新改。仅五天的时间，就消灭了过去整改中的10％左右的虚假数。连工人们提了几年没有解决的问题，这次也解决了。
    这次整改复查是结合着宣传目前形势和任务进行的，对群众生产热情有很大的鼓舞作用。全厂订出了全年增产五万吨钢的指标。几天来，各平炉之间的竞赛十分热烈，新纪录不断出现。连设备较旧、过去熔炼时间一般是九个多小时的八号平炉，最近两天也连创四次新纪录，最后一次炼一炉钢只用了六个小时零二十分钟。
