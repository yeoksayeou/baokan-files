Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 26th: The Fushun, Benxi, and Dalian steel plants have adopted the practice of signing inter-plant mutual aid contracts to help each other catch up with advanced levels. These three steel plants recently signed an inter-plant mutual aid contract in Fushun for the first half of this year. According to the contract, each plant will address fifteen major technical projects and one hundred and thirty-five general technical projects through mutual learning and assistance to overcome shortcomings in the first half of this year.

The first inter-plant mutual aid contract among these three steel plants was signed in October 1956. Including this one, they have signed three contracts in a little over a year.

Before signing the mutual aid contracts, these three steel plants attached great importance to the preparatory work. They carefully compared indicators to find areas of advancement. Based on the various technical and economic indicators collected by the three plants, they conducted ranking analysis, identified the advanced indicators and experiences of fraternal plants, and also identified the lagging indicators and reasons for backwardness in their own plants, clarifying the goals for learning from fraternal plants. For example, the convergence rate of forged tool steel at the Benxi Steel Plant was always considered relatively high nationwide. However, when the three plants compared their indicators, it was discovered that the Benxi Steel Plant's indicator was the lowest, while the Dalian Steel Plant's was the highest. The Dalian Steel Plant indeed had experience in forging heating cycles and operating methods. As a result, this project was included in the mutual aid contract as a subject of learning for the other two plants. In the process of comparing indicators and seeking advancement, thorough and comprehensive investigation and research are also necessary. Often, projects that appear backward in terms of numbers may have some advanced aspects. Once, the rolling mill operation rate of the Benxi Steel Plant was the lowest among the three plants in the comparative indicators. However, it was later discovered that although their indicator was low, they were the fastest at changing large ropes and rolling cylinders. Therefore, the Dalian and Fushun steel plants learned from the Benxi Steel Plant's experience in changing large ropes and rolling cylinders.

To implement the mutual aid contracts, these three steel plants often adopted methods of sending people to provide guidance and demonstrations and to conduct observation and learning. According to statistics, the three plants sent a total of more than four hundred people, mutually assisting in resolving three hundred and eighty-five projects. When they sent skilled and experienced personnel to fraternal plants to perform demonstrations and impart knowledge, they did so not just once but twice, until they had completely helped the workers of the fraternal plant to learn.

These three factories also, in accordance with the provisions of the contract, mutually supported manpower, raw materials, tools, and equipment, and mutually exchanged drawings and data to help solve the difficulties in improving production levels. The Fushun Steel Plant planned to modify the manual blooming mill into a semi-automatic one. The Dalian Steel Plant provided the drawings and related technical data of the semi-automatic blooming mill to the Fushun Steel Plant for reference, saving the Fushun Steel Plant a lot of detours. At the same time, the three steel plants also held professional meetings to concentrate technical forces and jointly solve major technical issues. In order to ensure the implementation of the mutual aid contract, a system of regular inspections and summary meetings was established. The steelmaking electric furnace workers also launched a competition with the equipment, with evaluations every quarter. Since the electric furnace workers of these three plants launched the competition in the second quarter of last year, the national plan has been overfulfilled every quarter, and various economic indicators have been significantly improved.

    东北三个钢厂签订厂际互助合同
    互助互学　共同前进
    据新华社沈阳26日电　抚顺、本溪、大连三个钢厂采取签订厂际互助合同的作法，相互帮助向先进水平看齐。这三个钢厂最近在抚顺签订了今年上半年的厂际互助合同。根据合同的规定，各厂在今年上半年内要取长补短、互相帮助解决的重大技术项目有十五个，一般技术项目有一百三十五个。
    这三个钢厂第一次的厂际互助合同是在1956年10月签订的。除这次外，一年多来，已经前后签订了三次。
    这三个钢厂在签订互助合同以前，都很重视合同的准备工作。他们认真地对比指标，寻找先进。根据三个厂搜集的各项技术经济指标，进行排队分析，找出兄弟厂的先进指标和先进经验，也找出本厂的落后指标和落后原因，明确向兄弟厂学习的目标。比如本溪钢厂锻锋钢的收合率，大家都一向认为在全国范围内是较高的，但是，当三个厂把指标一对比，方才发现本溪钢厂指标是最低的，最高的却是大连钢厂。大连钢厂锻造火次和操作方法确有经验。结果就把这一项目列入互助合同，作为其他两个工厂的学习内容。在对比指标、寻找先进过程中还要认真地全面调查研究。往往数字上反映落后的项目也有某一点是先进的。有一次，本溪钢厂轧钢作业率在三个厂对比指标中指标最低，但是以后发现他们指标虽然低，可是换大绳、换轧辊最快。因此，大连、抚顺两钢厂就向本溪钢厂学习换大绳、换轧辊的经验。
    这三个钢厂为实现互助合同，常采用互相派人指导表演和观摩学习的办法。据统计，三个厂共派出四百多人，相互帮助解决的项目有三百八十五个。它们各派出熟练的、经验丰富的人员到兄弟厂表演传授时，一次不行两次，一直到帮助兄弟厂工人完全学会为止。
    这三个工厂还按照合同规定，相互支援人力、原材料、工具设备和相互交换图纸资料，帮助解决提高生产水平中的难题。抚顺钢厂准备把体力操作的开坯机改作半自动化，大连钢厂就把半自动化开坯机的图纸和有关技术资料供给抚顺钢厂做参考，使抚顺钢厂少走了不少弯路。与此同时，三个钢厂还以召开专业会议形式，集中技术力量，共同解决有关重大技术课题。为了保证贯彻实现互助合同，建立了定期检查、总结会议制度；炼钢电炉职工还展开同设备竞赛，每季评比一次。这三个厂的电炉职工在去年第二季度展开竞赛以来，每个季度的国家计划都超额完成，各项经济指标都显著提高。
