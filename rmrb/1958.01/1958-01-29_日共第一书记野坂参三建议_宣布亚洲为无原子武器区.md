Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 28th—According to TASS, Japanese Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Nosaka Sanzō suggested on January 27th at a Japanese Communist Party election rally in Tokyo that Asia be declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone and that a collective security treaty be concluded.

　　Speaking at the rally organized by the Japanese Communist Party's Tokyo Metropolitan Committee, Nosaka Sanzō pointed out the great significance of Bulganin's letters to the heads of many countries. He said that these letters clearly and specifically suggested stopping nuclear weapons tests to meet the demands of people all over the world, and starting negotiations to resolve international problems. He also said that the representatives of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference held in Cairo also unanimously advocated declaring atomic weapons illegal and advocated negotiations between the East and the West.

　　Nosaka Sanzō said that, on the contrary, the United States continues to pursue the notorious "position of strength" policy. The United States has turned Japan's Okinawa Island into its atomic base; it is transporting atomic weapons to South Korea and Taiwan, as well as the Japanese mainland.

　　Nosaka Sanzō pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government is colluding with the United States in this regard. He said that the Japanese people will never allow their country's territory to be turned into a breeding ground for new wars.

　　Nosaka Sanzō then said that the Communists uphold peace and firmly oppose all attempts to plot new wars in any region of the world.

    日共第一书记野坂参三建议
    宣布亚洲为无原子武器区
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社东京讯：日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三27日在日本共产党在东京举行的竞选大会上建议，宣布亚洲为无原子武器地区，并且缔结集体安全条约。
    野坂参三在这个由日共东京都委员会组织的大会上讲话时指出了布尔加宁给许多国家首脑的信件的重大意义。他说，在这些信中明确而又具体地建议停止核武器试验以满足全世界人民的要求，并且开始举行谈判来解决国际问题。他又说，在开罗举行的亚非团结大会的代表们也一致主张宣布原子武器为非法，并且主张东西方之间进行谈判。
    野坂参三说，与此相反，美国却继续奉行臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策。美国把日本的冲绳岛变成了它的原子基地；向南朝鲜和台湾以及日本本国领土运送原子武器。
    野坂参三指出，岸信介政府在这方面和美国串通一气，他说，日本人民决不允许把本国领土变成新战争的策源地。
    野坂参三接着说，共产党人拥护和平，并且坚决反对想在世界任何地区策划新战争的各种企图。
