    Turning Experiences from Other Places into Local Wealth
    Tian Xiying
    In terms of agricultural production, it is correct to emphasize summarizing and promoting local experiences; because the natural conditions in the region are basically the same, it is easy to learn and adapt to local conditions, and the results are achieved quickly. In the future, local experiences should still be summarized in a timely manner and actively promoted. However, if one only emphasizes local experience and consciously or unconsciously rejects advanced experiences from other places, then that is not right.
    Some people overemphasize the differences in terrain, climate, soil, and other natural conditions in various regions, thus rejecting or refusing to actively learn from experiences in other places; some people believe that learning from experiences in other places is "mechanical copying" and that learning will lead to "mistakes"; still others are indifferent to experiences in other places, believing that they were created by other regions, so they lack the motivation to learn. It should be said that these emotions are not right, and the result is that they become complacent and enclosed, like hiding in a snail shell.
    Whether it is advanced experience from local or other places, it is the wealth of the whole people gained from practice by the working people. Some specific and detailed experiences in technology may not necessarily be applicable everywhere. However, general principles can be derived from many experiences. In particular, the experience of leadership methods can be learned everywhere. For example, the practice of cadres at all levels in Hongan County, Hubei Province, cultivating experimental fields is a very good method for leading production. It can turn those who lead production from laymen into experts, and it can avoid and reduce subjectivism, bureaucratism, and coercive commandism in leading production. This kind of working method does not involve natural conditions, nor will it make the mistake of mechanical copying, so it can be learned everywhere. As for the advanced experiences created by other places in production technology, in areas with basically the same conditions, they are generally very useful as long as they are slightly modified. Areas with different conditions will also have a role in inspiring themselves. The specific methods of governing the Mang River in Jiyuan County, Henan Province, may not be suitable for other areas, but the basic experiences created by the county, such as "overall planning and comprehensive management," can be universally learned in all regions, especially in mountainous and hilly areas.
    The masses are constantly creating advanced experiences, so learning is endless. As long as it is a good experience, we should learn it humbly (we should even learn from the experiences of capitalist countries in production technology, let alone the advanced experiences of other regions in our country). The important thing is to understand and apply it correctly to the actual work of our own county, district, township, and commune.
    The boundary between advanced and backward is not absolute, nor is it immutable. Backward areas should learn from advanced areas, and advanced areas actually have many things to learn from other areas. Hongan County gained a lot of experience and achievements in agricultural production last year, but the comrades of the county party committee did not become proud because of this; on the contrary, they attached great importance to learning from the experiences of other areas. Recently, they organized many people to study the experience of developing diversified operations in mountainous areas in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province; they sent people to Jun County in the province to learn the spirit and drive to conquer nature; and they also sent people to advanced fertilizer accumulation areas to learn fertilizer accumulation experience. Carrying out a large-scale exchange of advanced experiences nationwide will surely greatly promote the cause of socialist construction.
    Recently, some regions have organized delegations to various advanced regions to learn from their experiences, and advanced regions have also sent people to various places to pass on their experiences. Local newspapers and periodicals have also paid attention to introducing advanced experiences from other regions across the country. For example, the Hebei Provincial Conference of Agricultural Activists invited advanced units from many provinces to introduce their experiences at the conference; Zhejiang and other provinces sent people to Henan to learn the experience of governing the Mang River and the Shaying River; Henan and other provinces went to Tianjin Prefecture to learn the experience of transforming low-lying areas; and the Foshan Prefectural Committee of Guangdong also compiled, printed, and distributed the advanced experiences of water conservancy construction from all over the country, and organized county, district, and township cadres to study them. These practices can be universally promoted.

### 把外地的经验变成本地的财富

    把外地的经验变成本地的财富
    田喜盈
    在农业生产方面，强调总结和推广本地的经验，是正确的；因为本地区的自然条件基本相同，学起来容易做到因地制宜，收效较快。今后，对本地区的经验仍然要及时总结，积极推广。但是，如果单纯地强调本地经验，自觉或不自觉地排斥外地的先进经验，那就不对了。
    有些人过分强调各个地区的地形、气候、土壤等自然条件不同，因而拒绝或不肯积极地学习外地的经验；有人认为学习外地经验就是“生搬硬套”，学了要犯“错误”；还有人对外地经验无动于中，认为是其他地区创造的，因此学起来缺乏劲头。应该说，这些情绪都是不对的，其结果是使自己故步自封，像躲在蜗牛壳里一样。
    无论是本地的或外地的先进经验，都是劳动人民从实践中得来的全民的财富。一些技术方面的具体而微的经验，固然不一定到处都能应用。但是，从很多经验中是可以引伸出来一般的原则的。特别是领导方法的经验，那是到处都可以学习的。例如，湖北红安县各级干部培育试验田，正是领导生产的很好的方法，它可以使领导生产的人由外行变成内行，可以避免和减少领导生产中的主观主义、官僚主义和强迫命令作风。像这种工作方法，既不涉及自然条件的问题，也不会犯什么生搬硬套的错误，因此各地都可以学习。至于外地在生产技术上所创造的先进经验，在条件基本相同的地区，只要稍加变通，一般也是大有用处的。条件不同的地区，也会有启发自己的作用。河南济源县治理漭河的具体办法，不一定适合其他地区，但是这个县所创造的“全面规划、综合治理”等基本经验，却是各个地区都可以普遍学习的，特别是在山区和丘陵地区。
    群众不断地创造出先进的经验，因此学习是无止境的事。只要是好的经验，就应该虚心学习（连资本主义国家在生产技术上的经验我们都应该学习，何况我们国内其他地区的先进经验呢）。重要的是融会贯通，把外地经验正确地运用到自己的县、区、乡、社的实际工作中去。
    先进和落后的界限不是绝对的，也不是一成不变的。落后的地区固然要向先进地区学习，先进地区实际上也有很多东西需要向其他地区学习。红安县去年在农业生产上取得了不少经验和成绩，县委的同志们并没有因此骄傲；相反，他们很重视学习其他地区的经验。最近，他们就组织了许多人到湖南平江县学习山区发展多种经营的经验；派人到省内的均县去学习征服自然界的气魄和干劲；还派人到积肥先进地区学习积肥经验。在全国范围内进行一个先进经验的大交流，必然会大大地促进社会主义的建设事业。
    最近，有些地区纷纷组织代表团到各种先进地区去学习经验，先进地区也派人到各地传授经验，地方报刊也注意了介绍全国其他地区的先进经验。如河北省农业积极分子代表会议就邀请了很多省的先进单位到会上介绍经验；浙江等省派人到河南学习了治理漭河、沙颍河的经验；河南等省到天津专区学习了改造窪地的经验；广东佛山地委还汇集、印发了全国各地兴修水利的先进经验，组织县区乡干部学习。这些作法，可以普遍推行。
