Xinhua News Agency, 27th: In order to fundamentally control the floods of the Songhua River and comprehensively utilize its water resources, the Songhua River Basin Planning Commission was formally established in Beijing on the 23rd. The Songhua River Basin Planning Commission was established according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. The commission has decided to set up an office in Harbin, which will soon begin formal operations.

The director of the Songhua River Basin Planning Commission is Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the deputy director is Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. The members include Wang Zhen, Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, Feng Zhongyun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, Wang Lin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and the heads of Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other relevant departments of the Central Government, a total of eighteen people.

The Songhua River Basin Planning Commission held its first plenary session from the 23rd to the 25th, discussing and studying the planning tasks for the Songhua River Basin and deciding to establish an office.

The meeting held that controlling the floods of the Songhua River and comprehensively utilizing its water resources is of great significance for ensuring the safety of cities such as Harbin and Jilin, and promoting the development of industry and agriculture in Northeast China. In accordance with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and building the country through diligence and thrift, the meeting determined the general guiding principle for the Songhua River Basin planning: overall planning, comprehensive utilization, adapting to local conditions, unified leadership, fully and rationally utilizing water resources, and rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production. At the same time, it was required that long-term planning should be combined with short-term flood control and drainage; temporary measures should be combined with permanent solutions; projects should be mainly small-scale, with a combination of large, medium, and small-scale projects; and reliance on the masses should be combined with state power. It was required that within the near future (about ten years), effective prevention and control of Songhua River floods and waterlogging disasters should be achieved. The meeting believed that the realization of this plan will be conducive to achieving the increased production targets proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) two years ahead of schedule in the Songhua River Basin, and will promote the local industry in this region to catch up with or exceed the total agricultural output value during the second Five-Year Plan period. To this end, the meeting decided to put forward a short-term flood treatment plan above Harbin City in March and April 1958, and to propose the main points of the Songhua River Basin plan in 1959.

The Songhua River is a major river in Northeast China, flowing through Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It is two thousand kilometers long, with a basin area of more than 540,000 square kilometers. The basin contains important industrial and mining cities such as Harbin, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Jilin, with a population of more than 20 million and 150 million mu of cultivated land. Moreover, it has dense forests and abundant mineral resources. However, due to the large and concentrated rainfall and soil erosion in recent years, the difficulty of controlling the floods of the Songhua River has increased. In the past few years, the state has done a lot of work in controlling the floods of the Songhua River, protecting the safety of industrial cities such as Harbin, and reducing or eliminating flood disasters for the broad masses of the people and agricultural production. In order to eliminate the floods of the Songhua River as soon as possible, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have conducted many studies on the issue of controlling the Songhua River, and instructed Heilongjiang Province and relevant departments to put forward a plan for the Songhua River Basin as soon as possible. Since 1957, preparations for the preparation of the basin plan have begun.

    根治水患　综合利用水利资源
    松花江流域规划方针确定
    新华社27日讯  为了根治松花江水患和综合利用松花江水利资源，松花江流域规划委员会23日在北京正式成立。松花江流域规划委员会是根据中共中央、国务院的指示成立的。这个委员会决定在哈尔滨市设立办事机构，即将开始正式办公。
    松花江流域规划委员会主任为中共黑龙江省委第一书记欧阳钦、副主任为中共吉林省委第一书记吴德，委员有农垦部部长王震、水利部副部长冯仲云、电力工业部副部长王林和黑龙江省、吉林省、内蒙古自治区以及中央其它有关部门的负责人等共十八人。
    松花江流域规划委员会于23日到25日期间举行了第一次全体委员会议，讨论研究了松花江流域规划任务，确定成立了办事机构。
    这次会议认为，治理松花江水患和综合利用松花江水利资源，对保证哈尔滨、吉林等城市的安全，促进东北地区工、农业的发展有重要意义。会议根据多、快、好、省和勤俭建国的精神，确定了全面规划、综合利用、因地制宜、统一领导、充分合理地利用水利资源、迅速发展工农业生产，特别是农业生产，为松花江流域规划的总方针。同时要求：长期规划和近期的防洪、排涝相结合；治标和治本相结合；工程应该以小型为主，大、中、小型相结合；依靠群众为主和国家力量相结合。要求在近期（十年左右）内，做到有效地防治松花江洪水和内涝灾害。会议认为，这个规划的实现，将有利于在松花江流域内提早两年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所提出的增产指标，将促进这个地区的地方工业在第二个五年计划期间赶上或超过农业生产总产值。为此，会议确定在1958年3、4月间提出哈尔滨市以上近期洪水处理方案，在1959年提出松花江流域规划要点。
    松花江是东北的一条主要河流，流经吉林、黑龙江两省和内蒙古自治区，全长二千公里，流域面积五十四万多平方公里。流域内有哈尔滨、长春、齐齐哈尔、吉林等重要工矿城市，有人口二千多万，耕地一亿五千万亩，而且森林茂密，矿藏丰富。但是由于近年来雨量大而集中和水土流失等原因，增加了治理松花江水患的困难。几年来，国家在治理松花江水患方面曾做了许多工作，保卫了哈尔滨等工业城市的安全，使广大人民和农业生产减轻和免受了洪水灾害。为了早日消灭松花江水患，中共中央和国务院对治理松花江的问题曾做了多次研究，并指示黑龙江省和有关部门早日提出松花江流域规划方案。从1957年起，便开始了编制流域规划的准备工作。
