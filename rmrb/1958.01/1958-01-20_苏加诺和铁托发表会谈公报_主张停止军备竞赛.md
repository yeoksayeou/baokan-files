    新华社贝尔格莱德19日电　南斯拉夫通讯社今天发表了关于印度尼西亚总统苏加诺访问南斯拉夫的公报。
    公报说，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺从1月17日到19日访问了南斯拉夫总统铁托。在访问期间，苏加诺总统同铁托总统以友好的方式充分讨论了两国共同关心的问题。参加会谈的还有：印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约，南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇，国防国务秘书长戈什尼亚克大将，外交国务秘书长波波维奇。
    公报说：“双方在会谈中再次着重讨论了印度尼西亚人民和政府的正当要求，即西伊里安的问题应该遵照希望在自由、独立和和平中发展的印度尼西亚人民的民族权利和尊严来加以解决。”
    “双方以最大的注意研究了进一步发展一切方面、特别是经济方面的相互友好关系的可能性。不久将成立一个联合委员会来促进这些关系，并且将采取措施来扩大贸易交换，其中也包括南斯拉夫方面出售某些军事装备以供应印度尼西亚武装部队的需要。”“双方表示对充满重大悬而未决的问题的严重国际局势感到忧虑，并且认为，今天人类首先需要的是：停止毫无意义的军备竞赛，停止改善其他具有巨大摧毁能力的武器，并且签订一项关于裁军的国际协定。”
    公报说，双方对现在正在为安排一次国际会议而采取广泛行动这一事实感到满意，这种会议将会结束冷战气氛，并且能为解决悬而未决的国际问题创造基础。公报还说，双方都认为，那些不参加任何集团的国家能够对发展国际合作和加强和平作出相当大的贡献。
    公报最后宣布，双方同意，铁托总统将在今年内访问印度尼西亚。
