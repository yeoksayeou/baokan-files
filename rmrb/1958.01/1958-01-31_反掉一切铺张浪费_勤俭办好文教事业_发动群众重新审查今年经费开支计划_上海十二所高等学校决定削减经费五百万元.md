Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. Twelve universities in Shanghai mobilized the masses to re-examine this year's budget expenditure plan in accordance with the spirit of running schools diligently and frugally. According to preliminary statistics, under the condition of ensuring the quality of teaching, the schools have decided to cut about five million yuan from the funds allocated by the state, which is equivalent to 1.7 times the annual expenditure of Tongji University, an industrial university with 4,000 students.

Through special forums, debates, and exhibitions, the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff realized that running schools diligently and frugally is not only to save the people's hard-earned money, but also related to the fundamental question of what kind of students socialist universities should cultivate and how to cultivate them. After the masses were mobilized, they repeatedly broke through the minimum target of using 95% of the money to do 100% of the work proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress and the savings targets proposed by the school leaders. The atmosphere of comparing diligence and comparing savings has replaced the old atmosphere of comparing ostentation, pomp, and novelty.

Fudan University, which took the lead in opposing waste, originally planned to save 7% of its expenses this year, but after mass discussion, it was raised to 10%, and then to 15.7%. The physics, chemistry and other departments of this school made full use of the original equipment, resolutely reduced unnecessary expenses, and saved more than half of the teaching funds. Universities throughout the city have proposed to learn from Fudan and catch up with Fudan. Jiaotong University has decided to save at least 15% of this year's expenses and strive for 20%. Tongji University has initially determined to save more than 880,000 yuan, accounting for more than 23% of this year's total expenditure, which is the highest savings target among universities in the city so far. After a comprehensive inspection and arrangement of the school buildings, the university found that the originally planned construction of a 9,000-square-meter library and reading room this year could be completely solved by adjusting the existing school buildings, and only a book storage room needs to be added. This alone saved more than 400,000 yuan in capital construction funds.

Many universities are actively considering how to improve the utilization rate of existing scientific instruments and equipment. Shanghai First Medical College is establishing a central laboratory and a central library to centrally manage and use some of the more versatile and valuable instruments and books. The First Medical College also suggested that it share the sports field, medicinal herb garden, and pharmacy room with the newly built Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Tongji University has established a cooperative relationship with the Shanghai Hydropower Design Institute, and the Design Institute uses the school's hydraulic laboratory to conduct some tests on the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station project. Tongji University is contacting business departments such as construction engineering, municipal engineering, gas production, and highway construction, suggesting that it share relevant experimental equipment on campus with these units. For instruments and equipment that are not needed for teaching and scientific research, the schools are clearing them up and preparing to resolutely transfer them to universities and factories that need to use them.

In order to further tap the potential for savings and drive some backward schools, the heads of Shanghai universities held a meeting on the 29th to determine that the city's eighteen universities should be divided into four groups according to their business nature to launch a socialist competition against waste, and to organize inspections and evaluations.

    反掉一切铺张浪费　勤俭办好文教事业
    发动群众重新审查今年经费开支计划
    上海十二所高等学校决定削减经费五百万元
    新华社上海30日电　上海十二所高等学校发动群众，根据勤俭办校精神，重新审查了今年的经费开支计划。据初步统计，在保证教学质量的条件下，各校确定削减国家分配的经费已有五百万元左右，相当于一个拥有四千学生的工业大学——同济大学今年全年开支的一点七倍。
    通过专题鸣放、辩论、举办展览会，广大师生员工认识到勤俭办校不仅为了节约人民的血汗，而且关系到社会主义的高等学校应当培养什么样的学生和怎样培养学生的这一根本问题。群众发动起来之后，一再突破了上海市党代会提出的用95％的钱办百分之百的事的最低指标和学校领导方面提出的节约指标。比勤俭、比节约的风气已经代替了过去比排场气派、比大比新的旧风气。
    首先开始反浪费的复旦大学，原来计划节约今年经费开支7％，经群众讨论，提高到10％，随后又提高到15.7％。这个学校的物理、化学等系充分利用原有设备，坚决削减不必要的开支，节约的教学经费都达到一半以上。全市各高校纷纷提出了要学习复旦、追赶复旦。交通大学已决定在今年经费中至少节约15％，争取20％。同济大学初步确定节约经费八十八万多元，占今年全年开支23％以上，到目前为止，是全市节约指标最高的高等学校。这个大学对校舍进行了全面检查和安排后，发现原来确定在今年动工兴建的一座九千平方公尺的图书馆和阅览室等，完全可以在现有校舍中调剂解决，只需添建藏书库就行了，只这一笔，就节约了基本建设经费四十多万元。
    许多高等学校已在积极考虑如何提高现有科学仪器设备利用率的问题。上海第一医学院正在建立中心实验室和中心图书室，将一些用途较广的贵重仪器、图书资料集中管理和使用。第一医学院还建议同邻近新建的上海中医学院合用运动场、药圃和药学室。同济大学已和上海水力发电设计院建立协作关系，由设计院利用学校水力实验室进行新安江水力发电站工程的一些试验。同济大学正在同建筑工程、市政工程、煤气生产、公路建设等业务部门联系，建议同这些单位共同使用校内有关实验设备。对于教学和科学研究上都用不着的仪器器材，各校正在清查，准备坚决调拨给需要使用的高等学校和工厂企业部门。
    为了进一步挖掘节约潜力和带动部分落后学校，29日上海各高等学校负责人举行会议，确定将全市十八所高等学校按事业性质分成四组，展开反浪费的社会主义竞赛，并将组织检查和评比。
