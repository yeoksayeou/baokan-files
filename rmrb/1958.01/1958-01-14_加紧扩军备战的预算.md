Budget for Intensifying Military Expansion and Preparations
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    U.S. President Eisenhower, after delivering his "State of the Union Address" calling for the strengthening of military strength, also issued a "Budget Message" on the 13th demanding a significant increase in military expenditure. At a time when the call for stopping the "Cold War" and the arms race is growing louder among the people of all countries, the U.S. ruling clique has thus openly embarked on the path of military expansion, war preparations, and intensifying the arms race. This is a serious challenge to the peace aspirations of the people of all countries.
    According to the 1959 budget proposed by the U.S. President, all military expenditures account for more than 81% of the total budget. Even Eisenhower himself admitted that this is more than any year since 1955. The main part of this huge military expenditure will be used to develop missiles as well as atomic weapons and nuclear weapons. The purpose of this crazy behavior of the U.S. ruling clique is undoubtedly to continue to pursue the so-called "policy of strength" backed by "deterrent power." People know that the U.S. "policy of strength" and so-called "deterrent power" have completely failed in a situation where the Soviet Union's military and important science and technology are already in a superior position. Instead of considering how to eliminate the threat of nuclear war that worries people of all countries, the Eisenhower administration still wants to continue engaging in so-called "deterrent power" under the guise of ensuring U.S. "security." The result will not only make the people of all countries greatly uneasy, but will also make the security of the American people subject to direct threat in the first place.
    In his "State of the Union Address" and "Budget Message," Eisenhower tried his best to slander the Soviet Union, making it seem as if the U.S.'s actions to strengthen military expansion and war preparations were due to the so-called "threat" from the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's "long-term refusal to achieve a feasible disarmament attitude." Facts are the most eloquent. Soviet Premier Bulganin recently wrote to the U.S. President and other Western heads of government twice in less than a month, putting forward specific proposals to stop the Cold War and the arms race in order to achieve peaceful coexistence. In order to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue, the Soviet Union also announced the reduction of its armed forces by 300,000 people not long ago. The Soviet Union's efforts to strive for peace and achieve disarmament stand in sharp contrast to the U.S.'s actions to strengthen military expansion and war preparations by all possible means. Eisenhower's attempt to conceal the U.S. government's military expansion and war preparations by slandering the Soviet Union is futile.
    The Eisenhower administration's huge expenditures will flow into the pockets of U.S. military-industrial monopolies, in order to create a so-called "recovery" of U.S. "economic expansion" and to prevent the coming economic recession in the United States. However, the vast majority of the American people will inevitably continue to endure the increasing burden of taxes as a result. This practice of the U.S. government can only further promote inflation and create more serious difficulties for the U.S. economy.
    With this budget for military expansion and war preparations, the Eisenhower administration has once again announced its intention to oppose peace. The people of all countries must step up their opposition to this anti-peace policy of the U.S. ruling clique.

    加紧扩军备战的预算
    本报评论员
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在发表了那篇号召加强军事实力的“国情咨文”之后，又于13日发表了要求大大增加军事费用的“预算咨文”。在世界各国人民要求停止“冷战”和军备竞赛的呼声日益高涨的情况下，美国统治集团就这样公然地走上了扩军备战和加强军备竞赛的道路。这是对各国人民和平愿望的一种严重的挑战。
    根据美国总统所提出1959年度的预算，其中全部军事性质开支占到总预算的81％以上。连艾森豪威尔自己也承认，这比1955年以来任何一年都要多。这个庞大的军事开支的主要部分，将用于发展导弹以及原子武器和核武器。美国统治集团的这种疯狂行为，其目的无疑是要继续推行所谓以“威慑力量”为后盾的“实力政策”。人们知道，美国的“实力政策”和所谓“威慑力量”在苏联的军事和重要的科学技术已居于优势的情况下，是已经彻底破了产的。艾森豪威尔政府不去考虑如何消除各国人民所忧虑的核战争的威胁，而却还要在保证美国“安全”的幌子下来继续搞什么“威慑力量”，其结果不仅将使各国人民大为不安，而且也将使美国人民的安全首先遭受到直接的威胁。
    艾森豪威尔在他的“国情咨文”和“预算咨文”中竭力诬蔑苏联，把事情说成好像美国加强扩军备战的行动是由于遭受到了所谓苏联的“威胁”，以及苏联“长期拒绝实现可行的裁军的态度”。事实是最雄辩的。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁最近在不到一个月的期间，已两次写信给美国总统和其他西方国家的政府首脑，提出了制止冷战和停止军备竞赛以实现和平共处的具体建议；为了促进裁军问题的解决，苏联并且在不几天以前宣布裁减武装部队三十万人。苏联为争取和平和实现裁军而进行的努力，同美国竭尽一切可能来加强扩军备战的行动，形成了何等鲜明的对照。艾森豪威尔企图以诬蔑苏联来掩饰美国政府扩军备战的行动，这种做法是徒然的。
    艾森豪威尔政府的庞大的开支将源源地流入美国军火垄断集团的口袋，以便造成所谓美国的“经济扩张”的“恢复”，来阻止已经到来的美国经济上的衰退。然而，广大的美国人民却不能不因此继续忍受日益增加的捐税负担。美国政府的这种做法只能进一步促进通货膨胀，给美国经济造成更为严重的困难。
    艾森豪威尔政府以这个扩军备战的预算，再一次宣布了它反对和平的意图。各国人民必须加紧来反对美国统治集团的这种反和平的政策。
