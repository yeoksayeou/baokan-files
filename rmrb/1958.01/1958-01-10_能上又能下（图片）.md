    Able to Go Up and Down
    Right picture: The Tianjin Machine Tool Factory plans to trial-produce several precision gear machines this year. Due to the complexity of the products, the patternmaking group felt it would be difficult to complete the task of manufacturing product models. This time, Liu Xianmin, the head of the technology section, was transferred to the patternmaking group. He led the workers in proofreading the blueprints of the new products and, together with the design section, revised unreasonable designs, solving the difficulties in patternmaking. This is Liu Xianmin (center) and the workers of the group inspecting the quality of the finished models. Liu Xianmin used to be an old worker in this group as well.
    Left picture: Zhang Zhenqing, the Party branch secretary of the power department of the Tianjin Machine Tool Factory, used to be a skilled worker in making lead screws and lead compound rests. He was very popular among the masses when he served as the branch secretary. In November last year, he responded to the Party's call and returned to the workshop. Recently, his workload has exceeded the quota by more than two times.

    能上又能下
    右图：天津机床厂今年要试制几种精密的齿轮机，由于产品复杂，木型组感到完成制造产品模型的任务有困难。这次技术科长刘宪民下放到木型组，他带动工人校对了新产品的图纸，和设计科一起修改了不合理的设计，解决了木型制造的困难。这是刘宪民（中）和这个组的工人察看已制成的模型质量。刘宪民原来也是这个组的老工人。
    左图：天津机床厂动力部门党支部书记张振卿，原是作丝槓、复箱槓的能手，在作支部书记时，很受群众欢迎。去年11月份他响应党的号召回到车间。最近他的工作量超过了定额二倍以上。
