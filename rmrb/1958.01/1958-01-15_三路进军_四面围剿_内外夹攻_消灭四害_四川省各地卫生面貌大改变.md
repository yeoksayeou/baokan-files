Three-pronged Advance, Four-sided Encirclement, Internal and External Attack, Eliminate the Four Pests
Great Changes in Sanitary Conditions in Various Parts of Sichuan Province

    (Our report) Since mid-November of last year, 106 cities and counties in Sichuan Province have successively launched a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. According to incomplete statistics, in more than fifty days, the province eliminated more than one million rats and sparrows, as well as a large number of mosquitoes and flies. At the same time, in conjunction with agricultural production, large amounts of garbage, sewage, and other natural fertilizers were accumulated. At present, the campaign to eliminate the four pests in these areas is continuing to deepen.

    In the course of carrying out the movement in various parts of Sichuan, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, and they actively eradicated the four pests. In Nanchong City, from November 25 to December 25 last year, the city eliminated a total of 162,600 rats and sparrows and more than 1,000 catties of fly pupae in one month. Among them, more than 136,000 rats were eliminated, which, calculated according to the city's population, is close to one rat per person. In order to resolutely complete the task of eliminating 300,000 rats and sparrows, the city decided to extend the month-long shock campaign to eliminate the four pests to the end of January. Chengdu City extensively mobilized the masses and adopted methods of manual capture and elimination of the four pests' hiding places. In forty-five days, they also captured and killed more than 364,000 rats and sparrows and 3,300 catties of fly pupae. In conjunction with rectifying the city's appearance, improving environmental sanitation, and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, citizens carried out a major furniture relocation and thoroughly cleaned indoors and outdoors. Government cadres and students also joined the citizens in cleaning the streets, and a clean atmosphere appeared in the streets and alleys of the city. Many residential areas established and restored health systems such as ringing bells to sweep the streets during this campaign. Quanxin Alley, a national model hygiene area of ​​the second rank in the city, also carried out four thorough cleaning operations in a row during the campaign, and the cleaning and hygiene work was done more outstandingly than in general areas. Chongqing City adopted the method of simultaneous publicity and action to set off a wave of enthusiasm for eliminating the four pests. Propaganda windows in the city's streets and public entertainment venues have set up special columns for eliminating the four pests. Various cinemas and theaters also conduct publicity on eliminating the four pests before performances. The city's Patriotic Health Campaign Committee distributed more than 100,000 copies of publicity materials to citizens. The radio station broadcast a live recording of Mayor Ren Baige's report at a mass meeting of more than 6,000 people, and more than 300,000 listeners listened. At present, government agencies, schools, factories, and residents have organized a huge shock force to eliminate the four pests, adopting the methods of "three-pronged advance" (1. eliminate the hiding places of the four pests; 2. track down and capture; 3. do not let the mice have food), "four-sided encirclement" (everyone works together to prevent the four pests from having a hiding place), and "internal and external attack" (using artificial and medicinal methods to kill, indoors and outdoors at the same time) to eliminate the four pests. Guanjing Lane in Chongqing City used this method to capture more than 4,000 rats in twenty-four days. Luzhou and Ya'an cities organized inspection organizations during the movement to conduct in-depth inspections of work in the sections, government agencies, and schools. The masses in Luzhou City also universally established a system of ringing bells and installing rat boards. In Jiangbei, Wanxian, Yibin and other cities and counties, the number of people mobilized to participate in the elimination of the four pests was more than 100,000. Yibin City captured more than 70,000 rats in twenty days. The patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests in Qijiang, Jiang'an, Ba County and other places has been universally carried out in towns and agricultural cooperatives, so that the sanitary conditions of many market towns and agricultural cooperatives have undergone unprecedented changes.

    三路进军　四面围剿　内外夹攻　消灭四害
    四川省各地卫生面貌大改变
    本报讯　从去年11月中旬以来，四川省已有一百零六个市县先后开展了以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。据不完全的统计，在五十多天内全省消灭了一百多万只鼠、雀和大量的蚊、蝇，同时结合农业生产积了大量的垃圾、污水等自然肥料。目前这些地区的除四害运动，正在继续深入开展。
    四川各地在开展运动中，群众的热情很高，积极铲除四害。南充市在去年11月25日至12月25日一个月，全市共灭鼠、雀十六万二千六百多只，蝇蛹一千多斤，其中消灭老鼠十三万六千多只，按全市人口计算，快接近一人一鼠。该市为了坚决完成三十万只鼠、雀的任务，决定将除四害突击运动月延长到1月下旬。成都市广泛地发动了群众，采取人工捕打和清除四害窝藏地方的办法，也在四十五天内，捕灭鼠、雀三十六万四千多只，蝇蛹三千三百多斤，并结合整顿市容，改善环境卫生，清除蚊蝇孳生场所，市民进行了家具大搬家，彻底的清扫室内和室外；机关干部、学生也和市民一道参加清扫街道，市区大街小巷出现一片清洁气象。有许多居民地段在这次运动中建立和恢复了摇铃扫街等卫生制度。该市全国乙等卫生模范全心巷，也在运动中连续进行了四次彻底清扫工作，清洁卫生工作比一般地区都做得出色。重庆市采取边宣传、边动手的办法掀起了除四害热潮。市区街头和公共娱乐场所的宣传橱窗都设了除四害图片专栏，各影、剧院，在上演前也要作除四害宣传，市爱国卫生运动委员会发给市民的宣传资料十多万份；广播电台将任白戈市长在六千多人群众大会上的报告，作了实况录音广播，收听的听众三十多万人。目前机关、学校、工厂、居民已组织了庞大的除四害突击队伍，采取“三路进军”（一、搞掉四害的窝藏地方；二、追踪捕打；三、不让老鼠有吃的）、“四面围剿”（大家一齐动手，不让四害有藏身之地），“内外夹攻”（用人工和药物捕杀，室内室外同时进行）的办法消灭四害。重庆市官井巷运用这个办法在二十四天里，即捕老鼠四千多只。泸州、雅安市在运动中都组织了检查组织，深入到地段、机关、学校检查工作。泸州市的群众还普遍建立了摇铃安鼠板的制度。江北、万县、宜宾等县市发动参加除四害的群众都在十万人以上。宜宾市在二十天里捕鼠七万多只。綦江、江安、巴县等地的除四害爱国卫生运动，在城镇和农业社普遍开展，使许多的场镇和农业社的卫生面貌，起了空前的改变。
