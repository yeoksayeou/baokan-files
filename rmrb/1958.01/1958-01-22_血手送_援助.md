Notes
    Bloody Hands Offer "Aid"

    According to a "France-Presse" report, the United States will soon transport more than three thousand tons of food and some blankets and tents to Tunisia as "aid" to Algerian refugees.

    In fact, if the United States truly had any goodwill towards the Algerian people, it would be doing a great service to first stop aid to the French colonialists. On the one hand, they are slaughtering the Algerian people through the hands of the French colonialists, and on the other hand, they are putting on a hypocritical appearance of pity and wanting to "aid" the Algerian refugees. There is probably nothing more hypocritical in the world than this.

### 血手送“援助”

    血手送“援助”
    据“法新社”报道，美国不久将运送三千多吨食品和一部分毯子、帐篷到突尼斯去，作为对阿尔及利亚难民的“援助”。
    其实，美国如果对阿尔及利亚人民真正有一点好意，首先停止对法国殖民主义者的援助，就会是作了一大好事。一方面通过法国殖民主义者的手屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，另一方面又装出一副悲天悯人的样子要来“援助”阿尔及利亚的难民。世界上大概没有比这更伪善的事了。
