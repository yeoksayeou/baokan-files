To support agricultural cooperatives with more agricultural machinery, approximately 1,500 standard tractors will be added to tractor stations nationwide this year to meet the needs of further developing agricultural production. Currently, tractor stations in various regions are actively carrying out preparatory work, urgently mobilizing all employees to carry out multiple operations, and improve the utilization rate of machinery to help agricultural cooperatives increase production and income.

During the high tide of agricultural production, farmers' demands for agricultural machinery are becoming increasingly urgent. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, farmers in various regions are requesting the purchase of more than 120,000 standard small tractors. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the state has decided that, in addition to continuing to widely promote various new-style farm implements and irrigation and drainage machinery, it will also supply large quantities of domestically produced tractors suitable for various needs in different regions, as well as other agricultural machinery to rural areas to support agricultural production.

Over the past few years, many facts have proven that agricultural machinery has powerfully promoted the development of production in areas served by tractor stations.

First of all, the quality of machine耕作 (gengzuo – plowing/cultivation) is significantly higher than that of animal power and old-fashioned farm implements. According to surveys from many tractor stations, machine耕作 wheat can generally increase production by 20-30 jin per mu, cotton can increase production by 15-30 jin of seed cotton, and rice and miscellaneous grains can increase production by more than 40 jin; and the more machine operations there are, the more significant the increase in production. Surveys have also proven that the income of agricultural cooperatives has definitely increased due to the use of machine耕作. For example, the Beixiangyi Agricultural Cooperative in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, began using machine耕作 in the autumn of 1954. Machine耕作 cotton fields have consistently increased production by an average of more than 20 jin of seed cotton per mu compared to animal耕作 cotton fields. The members calculated that the value of the increased seed cotton from machine耕作 cotton fields was 7.6 yuan per mu, deducting the machine耕作 cost of 2.4 yuan per mu, the agricultural cooperative's net income was still 5.2 yuan more, accounting for a strong 68% of the increased value. The survey results from many other stations are mostly similar.

Secondly, in areas served by tractor stations, the use of machine耕作 increases the power of production and also solves the difficulty of insufficient labor and animal power in rural areas to a certain extent, thereby promoting intensive cultivation and increasing the multiple cropping index. For example, the Juba Agricultural Cooperative served by the Changde Tractor Station in Hunan Province was previously unable to grow double-cropping rice due to insufficient seasonal labor and animal power. After using machine耕作 in 1956, all 300 mu of paddy fields in one production team were converted to double-cropping rice, and the yield of rice per mu increased from more than 400 jin to more than 600 jin.

In the past few years, tractors have also been used to reclaim wasteland and support production in disaster areas. After the Beitagang Tuanbowo wasteland in Tianjin Special Zone, Hebei Province, was reclaimed by tractors, the yield of rice per mu was 500 jin, and the highest reached 800 jin, several times higher than the original yield of 100 jin per mu. Jiangxi Province reported that in 1957, the Fengcheng, Nanchang, Taihe, and Pengze tractor stations used tractors to help agricultural cooperatives fight drought on more than 50,000 mu of land. The members welcomed them with firecrackers, saying, "Better than sending charcoal in the snow."

The operation and management of tractor stations have also improved a lot in recent years, accumulating a lot of experience, training many cadres, and improving the utilization rate and operation quality of machinery. The operation projects are gradually increasing, and the operation costs are gradually decreasing. This has created very good conditions for tractors to serve agricultural production more widely.

    用更多的农业机械支援农业社
    今年增加拖拉机一千五百标准台
    本报讯　今年全国拖拉机站将增加拖拉机约一千五百标准台，以适应进一步发展农业生产的需要。目前，各地拖拉机站正在积极进行准备工作，紧张动员全体职工，开展多项作业，提高机具利用率，以帮助农业社增加生产，增加收入。
    在农业生产高潮中，农民对于农业机械的要求也越来越迫切。据农业部初步统计，各地农民要求购买小型拖拉机十二万多标准台。在第二个五年计划期间，国家已决定除继续大量推广各种新式农具和排灌机械外，也将以国产的适合各地不同需要的拖拉机以及其他各种农业机械大量供应农村，支援农业生产。
    几年来，许多事实证明，在拖拉机站服务地区，农业机器有力地推动了生产的发展。
    首先是机器耕作的质量比畜力和旧式农具耕作的质量显著提高。根据许多拖拉机站的调查，机械耕作的小麦一般每亩可增产二、三十斤，棉花可增产籽棉十五到三十斤，水稻和杂粮可增产四十斤以上；并且机械作业的项目愈多，增产也愈为显著。调查还证明，由于使用机械耕作，农业社的收入也肯定的增加了，如河北成安县北乡义农业社从1954年秋开始采用机器耕作，连年机耕棉田都比畜耕棉田平均每亩增产籽棉二十斤以上。社员们计算：机耕棉田每亩增产的籽棉价值七元六角，减去每亩支出的机耕费用二元四角，农业社的纯收益仍多五元二角，即占增产值的68％强。其他许多站调查结果，大都近似。
    其次，在拖拉机站服务地区，由于使用机器耕作，增加了生产动力，也在一定程度上解决了农村劳畜力不足的困难，从而促进精耕细作和提高复种指数。如湖南省常德拖拉机站服务的聚宝农业社，过去因季节性劳畜力不足，无力多种双季稻，1956年使用机耕后，一个生产队的三百亩水田全部改种了双季稻，每亩稻谷产量由四百多斤提高到六百多斤。
    在这几年中，拖拉机还利用来开荒和支援灾区生产。河北省天津专区北大港团泊窪荒地由拖拉机开垦后，水稻亩产五百斤，最高的达到八百斤，比原来每亩产一百斤增产数倍，江西省反映，1957年丰城、南昌、太和、彭泽四个拖拉机站利用拖拉机帮助农业社抗旱五万多亩，社员们放着鞭炮欢迎，说：“胜过雪里送炭。”
    拖拉机站的经营管理工作近年也有许多改进，积累了不少经验，培养了不少干部，机具利用率和作业质量都有提高，作业项目在逐渐增加，作业成本也在逐渐降低。这就为拖拉机更广泛地为农业生产服务创造了很好的条件。
