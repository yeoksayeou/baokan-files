Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 21st: Qiliying Agricultural Cooperative in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, has successfully trial-produced nutritious pig and livestock feed using cottonseed hulls, corncobs, peanut shells, and sweet potato vines. This solves the problem of feeding pigs and livestock and enhancing the physique of draft animals with less or no grain. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee attach great importance to this economically significant initiative and have issued a joint instruction to vigorously promote it throughout the province.

Scientific research institutions have verified that cottonseed hulls, corncobs, peanut shells, and sweet potato vines are rich in starch, fat, protein, etc. The nutritional value of one jin of cottonseed hulls is equivalent to seven liang of grain, one jin of sweet potato vines is equivalent to half a jin of grain, and one jin of corncobs or peanut shells is equivalent to more than nine liang of grain.

The pig and livestock feed made by Qiliying Agricultural Cooperative using these materials employs the following methods: The picked cottonseed hulls are first stir-fried in a pot until they are scorched yellow, then ground into a fine powder, then mixed with a small amount of distiller's grains and placed in a jar to ferment. Pigs love to eat this kind of feed, and they develop normally after eating it; a fifty-jin pig fed purely on this kind of feed can gain four jin in a week. Another type of feed is made by grinding cottonseed hulls, corncobs, peanut shells, and sweet potato vines into a fine powder, combining them, and mixing nine jin of this mixture with one jin of soybean powder (soybeans are stir-fried until yellow and then crushed). This feed is very good for feeding draft animals, and cattle, horses, and donkeys all love to eat it.

Qiliying Agricultural Cooperative is now using these feeds to feed pigs and livestock in large quantities. The cooperative has a total of 1,087 households, and originally only raised 280 pigs. After the successful trial production of this feed, the number of pigs raised in the cooperative increased to 692 in less than a month. The cooperative plans to increase the number of pigs to 1,500 this year. Xinxiang Prefecture has comprehensively promoted this experience. In the past half month or so, Xinxiang County has produced more than 195,700 jin of cottonseed hull pig feed and increased the number of pigs raised by 4,215.

According to the experimental results of Qiliying Cooperative in Xinxiang County, it is estimated that Henan Province could collect about 1.49 billion jin of corncobs, cottonseed hulls, and peanut shells alone in 1957. Due to the late discovery, it is difficult to fully utilize them this year, so even if only half is utilized, according to nutritional value, approximately 370 million jin of grain can be saved.

### 河南省决定推广一项有重大经济意义的创举  用棉桃壳等制成饲料节约粮食

    河南省决定推广一项有重大经济意义的创举
    用棉桃壳等制成饲料节约粮食
    新华社郑州21日电　河南省新乡县七里营农业社，利用棉桃壳、玉米心、花生皮、红薯秧试制成功营养丰富的猪、畜饲料，解决了少用或不用粮食也能喂肥猪、畜和增强耕畜体质的问题。中共河南省委和省人民委员会十分重视这项具有重大经济意义的创举，并发出联合指示，决定在全省范围内大力推广。
    经过科学研究机关化验证明，棉桃壳、玉米心、花生皮、红薯秧都有较丰富的淀粉、脂肪、蛋白质等；一斤棉桃壳的营养价值，可以顶七两粮食，一斤红薯秧可以顶半斤粮食，一斤玉米心或花生皮都能顶九两多粮食。
    七里营农业社利用这几种物料制成的猪、畜饲料，采用了下面的方法：将摘下来的棉桃壳，先用锅炒成焦黄色，再碾成细末，然后掺上少许的酒糟放进缸里发酵，就可以了。这种饲料，猪最喜爱吃，而且吃后发育正常；五十斤重的猪，纯喂这种饲料，在一个星期内可增膘四斤。另一种饲料，是将棉桃壳、玉米心、花生皮、红薯秧碾成细末，综合起来，每九斤掺一斤大豆的细末（把大豆炒黄碾碎），搅拌均匀就可以了。这种饲料，喂耕畜很好，牛、马、驴都很爱吃。
    七里营农业社现在已经大量使用这些饲料喂猪、畜。全社共一千零八十七户，原来仅养猪二百八十头，在试制成功这种饲料以后，不到一个月的时间，全社养猪就增加到六百九十二头。社里计划，在今年内增养到一千五百头猪。新乡专区已全面推广这种经验，新乡县在最近半个多月的时间内，制成了棉桃壳猪饲料一十九万五千七百多斤，增养了四千二百一十五头猪。
    据新乡县七里营社试验结果推算，河南省1957年仅玉米心、棉桃壳、花生皮三项即能收集约十四亿九千多万斤。由于发现较晚，本年度难以全部利用，就以利用一半来计算，按照营养价值，大约可以节约粮食三亿七千多万斤。
