Combining the Cooperative's Plan with Members' Plans
--Introducing Three Experiences in Planned Management from Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Shanxi Province
Bai Xinghua

Based on the experiences of various places in Shanxi in running cooperatives, to do a good job in the planned management of agricultural cooperatives, it is not only necessary to help agricultural cooperatives formulate long-term production plans and annual production plans under the guidance of the state plan, but also to help cooperative members formulate household production plans under the guidance of the cooperative's plan, and to combine the cooperative's plan with the individual plans of cooperative members. Only in this way can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cooperative members, ensure the completion of the cooperative's plan, and increase the income of cooperative members. Shanxi has the following experiences in this regard: "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" Chart

The first experience is the experience of the Xiangyuan Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in using the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart to guide production. The "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart was proposed to solve the contradiction between the collective and the individual in the implementation of the plan. When formulating the 1957 annual production plan, the Qianjin Cooperative paid attention to formulating the plan down to each household, and used the form of the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart to register the plans of the cooperative and the households. The specific method is: First, mobilize the cooperative members to formulate an annual production plan in accordance with the long-term plan for developing production. Then, according to the annual production plan, formulate the cooperative's annual plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline income. And according to the cooperative's labor day payment plan, calculate the estimated income per labor day and announce it to the cooperative members. Second, according to the number of labor days that each household should do or voluntarily report to do, help cooperative members formulate income plans household by household. At this time, the main emphasis is on encouraging cooperative members to invest more labor in the cooperative and increase income from the collective economy, and also pay attention to increasing individual income from accumulating more fertilizer, investing more in the cooperative, and engaging in more household sideline production. Not only formulate income plans, but also formulate expenditure plans. Third, formulate charts. The "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart is divided into two major columns: one column specifies the cooperative's annual income plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations; the investments that should be made, the burdens that should be borne, the public welfare fund that should be accumulated, and the production expenses that should be paid, the physical objects and cash that the cooperative members can net distribute. The other column specifies the cooperative member's own labor investment plan, income from dividends from the cooperative, investment in the cooperative, and household sideline income, etc. The forms are filled out and distributed to the cooperative members for safekeeping.

The implementation of "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" is of great significance: First, it combines the national plan, the cooperative's plan, and the individual plans of cooperative members in terms of production, and improves the cooperative members' ideological awareness of loving the country, loving the cooperative, and managing the household diligently and thriftily. After every household formulated the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart, more and more people offered ideas and methods for the cooperative. Last year, cooperative members contributed 458 ideas to the cooperative to strive for a bumper harvest. The cooperative adopted these strategies, which increased income by 8,500 yuan and saved expenses by 600 yuan.

Second, formulating and implementing the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart is the best way to implement the policy of "overall consideration and arrangement household by household." Through the formulation of the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart, the cooperative focused on helping 60 households with more people and less labor, and households with weak labor, "five guarantees" households, handicraft households with special skills, and relatively well-off middle peasant households whose income may be reduced to make production and living arrangements. Over the past year, the income of 23 poor households in the cooperative increased by 21% compared with 1956; the income of 3 "five guarantees" households increased by 9.4%; the income of 18 handicraft households increased by 29%; and the income of 16 relatively well-off middle peasant households increased by 12%. As a result, the income of 96% of the households in the cooperative increased compared with 1956; and the income level of 63% of the cooperative member households caught up with and exceeded the income level of local relatively well-off middle peasants.

Third, the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart is the goal of the whole cooperative's struggle and the basis for inspecting work. Because the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart was formulated, the cooperative cadres and cooperative members had plans for doing things and established the idea of ​​doing things according to the plan. For example, the summer inspection showed that the cooperative's sideline production in the first half of the year only completed 68.3% of the original plan; the original plan for cooperative members' personal sideline occupations was 4,800 yuan, but only 3,000 yuan was completed. At this time, the party branch and the management committee quickly studied with the cooperative members and took measures to ensure the completion of the plan. As a result, the sideline production plans of the cooperative and cooperative members were overfulfilled by the end of the year. The original plan for cooperative members' personal sideline income was 9,000 yuan for the whole year, but the actual amount completed was 20,000 yuan.

Fourth, using the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart to guide production is the specific application of the mass line leadership method. The process of formulating and implementing the "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart is the process of mobilizing the masses to run the cooperative democratically. The masses believe that "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" links the interests of the cooperative with the interests of individuals. The implementation is very active, and the cadres also see that with the support of the masses, the leadership is stronger. Therefore, the relationship between cadres and the masses is closer. Basic Labor Day System

The second experience is the experience of the Daren County Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in implementing the basic labor day system. The so-called basic labor day system is to assess the number of basic labor days that each cooperative member should reach throughout the year based on the actual labor needs of the entire cooperative throughout the year and the actual labor ability of each cooperative member. If a cooperative member fails to complete the basic labor days that should be done, they should pay the cooperative the amount of grain, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund that should be paid on average per labor day by the entire cooperative.

Determining the basic labor days that cooperative members should do is based on the estimated labor requirements calculated based on the entire cooperative's annual production needs, and then based on the entire cooperative's labor force and the labor ability of each cooperative member, the member's base score is used as the basis, and other conditions (such as whether they are sick) are used as a reference to carry out grading and standing in line, and determine separately. Due to the complexity of the situation of female labor, the basic labor day system will not be implemented for the time being.

In order to ensure that all cooperative members complete the basic labor days they should do, and to rationally arrange the time for collective labor and individual production in the cooperative, the cooperative has also carried out control on a quarterly basis based on the total number of basic labor days in the cooperative, and stipulated reward and punishment measures.

The result of the Dongfanghong Cooperative's implementation of the basic labor day system not only guaranteed the labor needs of the cooperative's collective production, but also enabled the cooperative members to actively engage in personal sideline production after completing the basic labor days, increasing their personal sideline income. In the past, there were more than 30 laborers aimlessly wandering outside. After the implementation of the basic labor day system, they all returned. The contradiction between cooperative members engaged in sideline handicrafts and those engaged in agriculture has also been resolved. In addition to participating in cooperative labor, the 54 handicraft workers in the cooperative also earned more than 7,100 yuan, did 3,700 fewer basic labor days, and paid 740 yuan in public accumulation funds. In this way, cooperative members engaged in agriculture were satisfied, and cooperative members engaged in handicraft production also felt that it was completely reasonable to pay some public accumulation funds due to the increase in income. This overcame the two deviations in the cooperative of restricting cooperative members too strictly or cooperative members only caring about themselves and not collective production.

However, the implementation of the basic labor day system also contains sharp and complex ideological struggles. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work so that all cooperative members can understand the significance of implementing this system and prevent the forced command style of simply engaging in it. Attention should be paid to the following in practice: First, the basic labor days assessed for cooperative members should be slightly lower than the actual labor days that cooperative members can do. For those who cannot meet the basic labor days due to special reasons such as illness, weddings, or funerals, they should be reduced as appropriate. Second, the amount of public accumulation funds to be paid for failing to complete the basic labor days that should be done should generally be calculated based on the difference between the average value that can be created per labor day and the actual dividend amount. However, for some cooperative members who are engaged in sideline and handicraft production and do not have much income, the amount of public accumulation funds that should be paid should be reduced as appropriate so as not to affect their lives and the development of sideline production. Third, it is necessary to regularly check the completion of basic labor days by each cooperative member, commend the advanced, criticize the backward, and promptly solve the difficulties and problems in the implementation to ensure the implementation of this system. Advance Payment Based on Remaining Labor Days

The third experience is the method of advance payment based on remaining labor days implemented by the Pingyao County Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative.

In order to solve the problem of cooperative members needing money and overcome the chaotic phenomenon in financial management, most agricultural cooperatives in the province implemented a system of advance payment to cooperative members in 1957. However, the advance payment methods were very chaotic, and often caused the phenomenon of "dividing empty" and "overspending."

The Pingyao County Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative adopted the method of advance payment based on remaining labor days to solve this problem. The specific method is: First, deduct a part of the labor days equal to the amount of grain retention stipulated by the state from the labor days done by each cooperative member household as the necessary labor days for eating grain. This part of the labor days will not be given an advance payment. Then, subtract the necessary labor days for eating grain from the labor days done by each household, and the remaining part will be the remaining labor days; an advance payment can be made for this part of the labor days.

Households with insufficient labor are solved by other methods.

This method of advance payment has three advantages: First, it correctly implements the distribution principle of "distribution according to work, more work, more gain," overcomes the phenomenon of egalitarianism in distribution, and thus greatly stimulates the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members. Second, it can help cooperative members plan their production and life in a planned way. Because the cooperative has a plan for advance payment based on remaining labor days, the cooperative members can understand in advance when and how many labor days they do, and they can get an advance payment, and they can invest labor in the cooperative in a planned way. And they know when they can get an advance payment, and they can spend the advance payment in a planned way. Third, it can overcome the phenomena of "dividing empty," "overspending," and random spending and borrowing, and put financial work on the right track.

The above three experiences have been promoted in some agricultural cooperatives throughout the province. In the process of promotion, we further realized that these three experiences are closely related. The "Knowing the Whole Year in Advance" chart is the best form of combining the plans of the cooperative and cooperative members in terms of production. The basic labor day system is the best way to combine the plans of the cooperative and cooperative members in terms of labor allocation. And the advance payment based on remaining labor days is an effective method of combining the plans of the cooperative and cooperative members in terms of financial distribution. Therefore, combining these three experiences can comprehensively strengthen the planned management of agricultural cooperatives, guide the actions of cooperative members by the cooperative's plan, and promote cooperative members to care about the cooperative's collective economy.

    社的计划和社员的计划结合起来
    ——介绍山西省农业生产合作社进行计划管理的三项经验
    白兴华
    根据山西各地办社的经验，要做好农业社的计划管理工作，不仅必须在国家计划指导下帮助农业社制订好长远生产规划和年度生产计划，而且应该在社的计划指导下帮助社员制订出家庭生产计划，并且把社的计划和社员个人计划结合起来。这样，才能够充分调动社员的积极性，保证完成社的计划和增加社员收入。山西在这方面有以下几条经验：“一年早知道”图表
    第一条经验是襄垣前进农业社创造的用“一年早知道”图表指导生产的经验。“一年早知道”图表是为了解决执行计划中集体和个人之间的矛盾而提出来的。前进社在制订1957年度的生产计划时，注意了把计划制订到户，并且用“一年早知道”图表的形式，把社和户的计划登记下来。具体做法是：第一步，发动社员按照发展生产的长远规划订出年度生产计划。然后，按照年度生产计划订出全社全年的农业、林业、畜牧业和副业收入计划。并且根据全社的劳动日支付计划，计算出每个劳动日的预计收入，向社员公布。第二步，根据每户应做的劳动日或者自报要做的劳动日数，帮助社员逐户制订收入计划。在这个时候，主要强调社员多向社投工，从集体经济中增加收入，同时也注意从多积肥、多向社投资和多搞家庭副业生产等方面增加个人收入。不仅制订收入计划，也制订支出计划。第三步，制订图表。“一年早知道”表分为两大栏：一栏填明全社全年的农业、林业、畜牧业和副业的收入计划；应该垫的投资，应出的负担，应积累的公积金，公益金和应支出的生产费，社员能够净分的实物及现金。另一栏填明社员自己的劳动投工计划，从社内分红的收入，向社的投资和家庭副业收入等。表格填好后发社员保存。
    实行“一年早知道”有很大的意义：第一，它从生产上把国家计划、社的计划和社员个人计划结合起来，提高了社员爱国、爱社、勤俭持家的思想觉悟。在家家户户制订了“一年早知道”图表后，为社出主意想办法的人越来越多。去年社员为争取大丰收向社献计四百五十八条，社内采纳了这些计策，共增加收入八千五百元，节省开支六百元。
    第二，制订和执行“一年早知道”图表，又是贯彻执行“统筹兼顾、逐户安排”的方针的最好方法。通过制订“一年早知道”图表，社内着重帮助六十户人多劳力少和劳动力弱的困难户、“五保”户，有特别技术的手工业户，收入可能减少的富裕中农户进行了生产和生活安排。一年来，全社有二十三户困难户，收入比1956年增加了21％；三户“五保”户收入增加了9.4％；十八户手工业户收入增加了29％；十六户富裕中农收入增加了12％。因而，全社有96％的户比1956年增加了收入；有63％的社员户赶上和超过了当地富裕中农的收入水平。
    第三，“一年早知道”图表是全社奋斗的目标和检查工作的依据。由于制订了“一年早知道”图表，社干部和社员做事行动都有了计划，树立了按计划办事的思想。如夏季检查上半年社内副业生产只完成了原订计划的68.3％；社员个人副业原计划收入四千八百元，只完成了三千元。这时，党支部和管理委员会便抓紧和社员研究，采取了保证完成计划的措施。结果，到年终社和社员的副业生产计划都超额完成，社员个人副业原计划全年收入九千元，实际完成了两万元。
    第四，用“一年早知道”图表指导生产，是群众路线的领导方法的具体应用。制订和执行“一年早知道”图表的过程，就是发动群众进行民主办社的过程。群众认为：“一年早知道”把社的利益和个人利益联系在了一起，执行起来很积极，干部也看到有了群众的依靠，领导更加强。因此，干部和群众的关系更加密切了。基本劳动日制
    第二条经验是大仁县东方红农业社实行基本劳动日制度的经验。所谓基本劳动日制度，就是根据全社全年用工的实际需要和每个社员实际的劳动能力，给每一个社员评定出全年应该达到的基本劳动日数。如有社员完不成应做的基本劳动日，就应该按全社每个劳动日平均应出的公粮、公积金和公益金的数量，向社补交款。
    确定社员应做的基本劳动日，是根据全社全年的生产需要算出预计用工数，然后根据全社劳动力的情况和每个社员的劳动能力，以社员底分为依据，参照其他条件（如是否有病）进行分等站队，分别确定。妇女劳动力因情况复杂，暂不实行基本劳动日制度。
    为了保证使全体社员完成自己应做的基本劳动日，和合理安排社内集体劳动和社内个人生产的时间，社内又根据全社的基本劳动日数，分季做了控制，并规定了奖惩办法。
    东方红社执行基本劳动日制度的结果，不仅保证了社内集体生产的劳动需要，并且社员在完成基本劳动日后，积极从事个人副业生产，增加了个人副业收入。过去有三十多个劳动力在外盲目乱转，实行基本劳动日制度后都回来了。从事副业手工业和从事农业的社员之间的矛盾也解决了。全社五十四个手工业工人除参加社劳动外，还赚回七千一百余元，少做基本劳动日三千七百个，补交公积金七百四十元。这样，从事农业的社员满意了，而从事手工业生产的社员由于收入增加，也觉得缴些公积金是完全合理的。这就克服了社内对社员限制过严，或者社员只顾自己不顾集体生产的两种偏向。
    但是，贯彻执行基本劳动日制度，也包含着尖锐复杂的思想斗争，因此，必须加强政治思想工作，使全体社员弄清实行这一制度的意义，防止产生简单从事的强迫命令作风。在做法上应注意：第一，评定社员的基本劳动日应该略低于社员实际能做的劳动日数。对于有疾病、婚丧等特殊原因而做不到基本劳动日的，应该酌情减少。第二，因做不到应做的基本劳动日补交公积金的数量，一般地应该是根据每个劳动日平均所能够创造的价值和实际分红数之间的差额计算。但对某些从事副业、手工业生产而收入不多的社员，应酌情减少应缴的公积金数量，以免影响他们的生活和副业生产的发展。第三，要定期检查每个社员完成基本劳动日的情况，表扬先进，批评落后，及时解决执行中的困难和问题，以保证这一制度的执行。按剩余劳动日预支款
    第三条经验是平遥县红星农业社实行按剩余劳动日预支款的办法。
    为了解决社员要花钱的困难，克服财务管理上的混乱现象，1957年全省大多数农业社都实行了给社员预支款的制度。但预支办法很混乱，又常造成“分空”和“超支”现象。
    平遥县红星农业社对解决这个问题，是采取了按剩余劳动日预支款的办法。具体做法是：首先从每户社员所做的劳动日中，扣除与国家规定的粮食留量相等价的一部分劳动日，做为吃粮的必要劳动日数，这一部分劳动日不给预支款。再从每户所做的劳动日中减去吃粮的必要劳动日，其余部分即做为剩余劳动日；这部分劳动日可以预支款。
    劳动力不足的户另设办法解决。
    这样预支办法有三点好处：第一，正确地贯彻执行了“按劳取酬、多劳多得”的分配原则，克服了分配中的平均主义现象，因而大大激发了社员的劳动积极性。第二，能够帮助社员有计划地安排自己的生产和生活。由于社内有了按剩余劳动日预支的规划，社员事先就能够明白，到什么时候做多少个劳动日，就能够预支款，都能有计划地向社投工。并且知道什么时候才能够预支，对预支到的款进行有计划的支出。第三，能克服“分空”、“超支”现象和胡支乱借现象，使财务工作走上正轨。
    以上的三项经验，已经在全省的一部分农业社中得到推广。在推行中，我们进一步体会到这三项经验是有密切连系的。“一年早知道”图表是从生产上把社和社员计划结合起来的最好形式，基本劳动日制度是从劳动支配上把社和社员计划结合起来的最好办法；而按剩余劳动日预支款又是从财务分配上把社和社员计划结合起来的有效方法。因而把这三项经验结合起来，就能够全面地加强农业社的计划管理工作，使社员的行动受到社的计划的指导，促使社员关心社内的集体经济。
