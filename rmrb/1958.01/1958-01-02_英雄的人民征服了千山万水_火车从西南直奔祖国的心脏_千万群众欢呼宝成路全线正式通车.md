Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 1st. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway officially opened to traffic today. More than 50,000 people gathered at Chengdu Railway Station Square to hold a grand opening ceremony.

Chengdu, an ancient city with a history of more than 2,000 years, was once again dressed in festive attire today. Red arches and colorful flags decorated the streets and alleys, and joyous crowds converged on the station square from all directions in the morning. Today, the Chengdu Railway Station, surrounded by countless colorful flags, looked particularly beautiful and magnificent. Five years ago, the people of Chengdu celebrated the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had been looking forward to for forty years. Today, they gathered here again with representatives from Shaanxi and Gansu provinces to jointly celebrate the official opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the first railway in Sichuan Province to connect with the rest of the country.

At 2:00 p.m., the ceremony began. Vice Premier of the State Council He Long delivered a speech at the meeting. On behalf of the State Council, he warmly congratulated the victory of completing the arduous Baoji-Chengdu Railway project and the formal opening of the entire line. He pointed out that the opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is another great victory in China's socialist construction. It is not only a necessary transportation artery for the country to establish industrial bases in the Northwest and Southwest regions in the future, but also a major event related to the economic lives of more than 100 million people in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

U Kyaw Nyein, Deputy Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, who was visiting Chengdu, was also invited to speak at the meeting. He said that in the past, people said "The road to Sichuan is difficult, more difficult than ascending to the sky"; now, this arduous railway, more than 600 kilometers long, crossing high mountains and ridges, has been completed ahead of schedule. On this auspicious day, I express my admiration to the Government of the People's Republic of China. He finally expressed his wish that the friendship between China and Burma would continue to move forward like the train on this railway.

Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan pointed out in his speech that the formal opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway connects the Northwest, Southwest, and the entire country, which will play a significant role in industry, agriculture, and national defense. The arduousness of the construction of this railway project is rare in the history of Chinese railways. Teng Daiyuan said that China's completion of this arduous railway project provides rich experience and lessons for the construction of mountain railways in the future.

Zhao Shoushan, Governor of Shaanxi Province, Huang Zhengqing, Deputy Governor of Gansu Province, and Li Dazhang, Governor of Sichuan Province, also spoke at the meeting. They all believed that this railway would play a major role in promoting the economic construction and improving the people's lives in their respective provinces.

Soviet expert representative Piskunov also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is a masterpiece of the talent and hard work of Chinese railway workers. He congratulated on the completion and opening of this project.

Huang Xinyi, Director of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and Li Liangchen, a representative of railway workers, also spoke at the meeting.

The ceremony ended at 4:00 p.m. Then, the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening began. Vice Premier He Long cut the ribbon amidst cheers from tens of thousands of people. Immediately afterwards, China's first passenger train from the Southwest to the capital slowly started. Vice Premier He Long and Deputy Prime Minister of the Union of Burma U Kyaw Nyein, along with the crowd waving colorful scarves, stood by the platform, frequently waving goodbye to the passengers on the train. At this time, a 300-person choir sang songs praising the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in unison. The decorated train, amid songs and cheers, whistled and headed towards the heart of the motherland – the capital – along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

Also attending the ceremony today were Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Kang Sheng, Vice Minister of National Defense General Huang Kecheng, Member of the CPC Central Committee Wang Weizhou, Alternate Member of the CPC Central Committee and President of the Central Advanced Party School of the CPC Yang Xianzhen, Deputy Director of the Sports Commission Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Fu Zhong, Vice Minister of Railways Wu Jingtian, Vice Minister of Geology Li Jihuan, Vice Minister of Coal Industry Zhong Ziyun, Deputy Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council Zhang Guojian, Commander of the Railway Corps Li Shouxuan, Deputy Commander Liu Ke, Deputy Political Commissar Wang Jicheng, as well as guests from Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and other places.

    新华社成都1日电　宝成铁路今天正式通车。五万多人欢聚在成都车站广场隆重举行了通车典礼。
    成都这座具有两千多年历史的古城，今天再次披上了节日的盛装。大街小巷都装饰着红色的牌楼和彩旗，欢乐的人群清晨从四面八方汇流到车站广场。今天，被数不清的彩旗环绕着的成都车站显得格外美丽壮观；五年以前，成都人民曾经在这里欢庆四川人民盼望了四十年的成渝铁路建成，今天又重聚在这里同陕甘两省前来参加典礼的代表一起，共同庆祝四川省第一条联系全国的铁路——宝成铁路正式通车。
    下午二时，典礼宣告开始。国务院副总理贺龙在会上首先致词。他代表国务院热烈庆贺修成宝成路这一艰巨工程的胜利和全线正式通车。他指出：宝成铁路通车，是我国社会主义建设事业的又一次伟大胜利。它不仅是国家今后在西北、西南地区建立工业基地所必须的运输干线，也是关联着陕甘川三省一亿以上人民经济生活的重大事件。他的讲话一再被热烈的掌声所打断。
    正在成都访问的贵宾缅甸联邦副总理吴觉迎，也应邀在会上讲了话。他说，过去听人说“蜀道难难于上青天”；现在，这条艰巨的、长达六百多公里的、跨过高山峻岭的铁路，比计划提前建成了。在这个吉祥的日子里，我向中华人民共和国政府表示钦佩。他最后表示，愿中缅友谊像这条铁路上的火车一样不断前进。
    铁道部部长滕代远在会上讲话指出，宝成铁路的正式通车，把西北西南和全国联成一片，对工业农业和国防都将起着重大的作用。这条铁路修筑工程的艰巨程度，在中国铁路史上是少有的。滕代远说，我国建成这条艰巨的铁路工程，为今后建设山区铁路提供了丰富的经验教训。
    在会上讲话的，还有陕西省省长赵寿山、甘肃省副省长黄正清、四川省省长李大章。他们都认为这条铁路对发展本省的经济建设和提高人民生活，将起重大的促进作用。

    下午四时典礼宣告结束。接着，通车剪采仪式开始。贺龙副总理在成千成万群众的欢呼声中剪断了采绸。随即，我国第一次从西南开往首都的旅客列车徐徐开动，贺龙副总理和缅甸联邦副总理吴觉迎等同挥舞各色采巾的人群一起站在月台旁，向列车上的旅客们频频招手送别。这时，三百人组成的合唱队齐声高唱起歌颂宝成铁路的歌曲，扎采的列车在歌声和欢呼中长啸一声沿着宝成铁路奔向祖国的心脏——首都。
    今天参加典礼的还有国务院副总理聂荣臻，中共中央政治局候补委员康生，国防部副部长黄克诚大将，中共中央委员王维舟，中共候补中央委员、中共中央高级党校校长杨献珍，体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任傅钟上将，铁道部副部长武竞天，地质部副部长李济寰，煤炭工业部副部长钟子云，国务院第六办公室副主任张国坚，铁道兵司令员李寿轩、副司令员刘克、副政委王集成，以及陕、甘、川等地来宾。
