Daye Iron Mine Construction Advances by Leaps and Bounds
East Open-Pit Mine Initially Formed

(Our Dispatch) Correspondent Xiao Ding reports: The construction of the Daye Iron Mine area has achieved tremendous accomplishments. Electric locomotives have ascended the mountains; the concentrator plant has begun intensive construction; the Wu(chang)-Da(ye) railway has been fully completed. In the most abundant mineral deposits of Jianshan, Shizishan, and Xiangbishan, a vast East Open-Pit Mine has been initially formed.

A year ago, Jianshan and Shizishan were two mountain peaks standing opposite each other, over two hundred meters above sea level. Today, these two mountain peaks have been lowered by one hundred meters. At Jianshan, where construction started earliest, what used to be rocky mountain peaks have now been transformed, the rocks have been removed, and the mountains have become iron mountains exposing reddish-brown ore bodies. At the foot of the iron mountain, the newly built eighty-plus li Wu(chang)-Da(ye) railway has been fully completed. It is the main transportation line connecting the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise to the mine. In the future, ore from the mountain will be transported to the Wuhan Iron and Steel plant area from here. On the western side of Shizishan, a mountain railway connecting to the Wu-Da line has been built to the top of Shizishan. It is built on the cliffs and steep slopes of the mountain, winding upwards in a "zigzag" shape. Now, tens of kilometers of sleepers, rails, and electrified wires have been laid to the top of the mountain. Electric locomotives transported from the Soviet Union have arrived at the iron mountain and have been tested.

At the foot of the mountains, surrounded by Jianshan, Xiangbishan, and Shizishan, a large-scale concentrator plant has begun construction. This is a main plant building of Wuhan Iron and Steel. Currently, the crushing system has fully commenced operations, and it will be responsible for crushing the ore for Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace when it is put into production in 1958.

In order to ensure the ore required for Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace to be put into production in 1958, the construction tasks of the Daye Iron Mine in 1958 have increased by more than 60% compared to 1957. Wuhan Iron and Steel also requires the iron mountain builders to recover hundreds of thousands of tons of ore during stripping to supply No. 1 blast furnace. Currently, tens of thousands of workers are widely carrying out preparatory work. They will not only complete the task of ore recovery, but also ensure that the entire iron mine's basic construction project is completed this year to welcome the full-scale mining in 1959.

### 大冶铁矿建设大步前进  东露天采矿厂初步形成

    大冶铁矿建设大步前进
    东露天采矿厂初步形成
    本报讯　通讯员肖定报道：大冶铁矿区的建设取得了巨大的成就；电气机车上了山；选矿厂开始紧张施工；武（昌）大（冶）铁路全线修通。在矿藏量最丰富的尖山、狮子山、象鼻山上，一座规模巨大的东露天采矿厂已初步形成。
    一年以前，尖山和狮子山还是两座拔海二百多公尺东西对峙的山峰，今天，这两座山峰已下降了一百公尺。在最早开工的尖山上，原来还是一些岩石的山尖，现在，岩石被搬走了，变成了袒露赤褐色矿体的铁山了。在铁山脚下，新建的八十多里的武（昌）大（冶）铁路已全部建成。它是武汉钢铁联合企业通往矿山的主要交通线，将来，山上的矿石就要从这里运到武钢厂区。在狮子山的西边，联接武大线的一条上山铁路修到了狮子山的山顶。它是在悬岩陡壁的山坡上筑起来的，像一个“之”字形蜿蜒而上。现在，十几公里的枕木、铁轨、摩电线已铺设到山顶，从苏联运来的电气机车已到了铁山，并且试了车。
    在尖山、象鼻山、狮子山环抱的山脚下，一座规模宏大的选矿厂开始建设了。这是武钢的一个主体厂房，目前，破碎系统已经全面开工，它将在1958年担负武钢一号高炉投入生产的矿石破碎任务。
    为了保证武钢一号高炉1958年投入生产后所需要的矿石，1958年大冶铁矿的建设任务比1957年增加60％以上。武钢还要求铁山建设者在剥离中回收几十万吨矿，以供应一号高炉。目前，上万名职工正在广泛地开展准备工作，他们不仅要完成矿石回收的任务，而且还保证在今年完成整个铁矿的基本建设工程，迎接1959年的全面开采。
