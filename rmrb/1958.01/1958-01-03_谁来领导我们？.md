	Who Will Lead Us?
	The Andong Salt District in the southeast of Hangzhou Bay, Zhejiang, is the largest salt field in Zhejiang, with more than 40,000 people. Since the realization of advanced cooperativization in the entire district in 1956, salt production has developed rapidly, with annual output increasing from nearly three million dan to more than four million dan. In addition to supplying edible, fishing, and industrial salt to the people of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, most of the crude salt is transported to Jiangxi, Central China, and South China. In addition to salt production, the district also produces fish, cotton, rice, and salt by-products. However, such a good place is ignored by the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee. They do not issue instructions to the salt district, nor do they allow the cadres of the salt district to participate in relevant meetings, leaving the Andong Salt District Working Committee of the Communist Party of China in a state of isolation. In 1957, the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee held meetings for county and city party secretaries, etc., and people from various counties and districts participated, but no one from our district even attended as observers. After the meeting, no one conveyed the content to our district, which resulted in our district's failure to launch the increase production and practice economy campaign in a timely manner, seriously affecting the completion of the 1957 production tasks.
	In June and July 1957, the Prefectural Party Committee issued a notice stating that salt production, cooperativization, etc., were to be led by the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, and other aspects were to be led by the Cixi County Party Committee, and sent guidance documents on salt production and cooperativization to the county and city party committees, as well as to the working committee and the district people's committee. But the notice remained a notice, and everything remained the same. Although everyone raised many opinions during this rectification movement, it did not attract the attention of relevant departments. If this continues, the consequences will be disastrous. I really don't understand why the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee don't lead us.
		The Andong Salt District Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhedong

    谁来领导我们？
    浙江杭州湾东南的庵东盐区，是浙江的第一大盐场，有四万多人。自1956年全区实现了高级合作化以来，盐业生产迅速发展，年产量由将近三百万担增加到四百余万担，除供应浙江、江苏两省人民的食用和渔业、工业用盐外，大部原盐运往江西、华中、华南等地。全区除产盐外，还有渔、棉、稻及盐副产品等。但是，这么好的一个地方，省委、地委却置之不理，不给盐区发指示，不让盐区的干部参加有关会议，使中共庵东盐区工委处于四面不通风的境地。1957年省委、地委先后都召开了县、市委书记等会议，各县、区都有人参加，而我区连列席的人也没有，会后也没有人向我区传达，致使我区没有及时开展增产节约运动，严重地影响了1957年生产任务的完成。
    1957年6、7月间地委下达通知，说盐业生产、合作化等由省委、地委领导，其他方面由慈溪县委领导，发给县、市委以及有关盐业生产、合作化的指导文件，同时发给工委和区人民委员会。但通知仍然是通知，一切依然如故。这次整风运动中，虽然大家提了很多意见，但引不起有关部门的重视。长此以往，后果不堪设想。真不明白，为什么省委、地委不来领导我们。
