Xinhua News Agency, Guwahati, 18th - According to Xinhua News Agency: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, when discussing a resolution on international issues at the 63rd annual meeting of the Indian National Congress here today, said that without the participation of the Soviet Union and China, world disarmament negotiations would be unreal.

    Prime Minister Nehru said in his speech that whether people like it or not, China is a powerful country. It is strange that such a powerful country is being treated as a "pariah of the world" and excluded from disarmament talks. He pointed out that China's strength is growing day by day. He said, "If China is excluded, effective and genuine disarmament negotiations cannot be held."

    Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the world today is like "dangerously standing on the edge of a sword." Disarmament is of utmost importance in easing international tensions.

    Prime Minister Nehru also sharply criticized the United States' actions, as it had ordered its planes in Europe to fly day and night carrying hydrogen bombs. Prime Minister Nehru said that the most regrettable thing is that today the fate of mankind is tied to the judgment of the captain of an American bomber carrying hydrogen bombs, and any mistake he makes could trigger a world war. Prime Minister Nehru said that in such a tense situation, countries like India can play their role in effectively maintaining world peace.

    Indian Defense Minister Menon also expressed similar views at the meeting. He said that the US bombers flying with hydrogen bombs over Western Europe were not intended to ease international tensions, but to prepare for war. Menon said that although there has been some easing of world tensions recently, the situation is not yet reassuring. Any further deterioration of tensions would lead to war. Therefore, world disarmament has become an urgent problem to be solved. Menon also said, "Disarmament is not peace, but once disarmament is achieved, peace should follow." He pointed out that the previous United Nations disarmament negotiation mechanism was flawed, which is why disarmament negotiations are at a standstill today. He believes that effective disarmament cannot be achieved unless the Soviet Union, the United States, and China reach an agreement. Menon called on major powers to hold disarmament negotiations.

    Orissa State Chief Minister Mahatab, when presenting a resolution on international issues at the meeting, said that some people are still conducting activities to deprive the true China of its representation, thereby turning the United Nations into the United States. If this situation is allowed to continue forever, the world will be finished. He pointed out that if those undemocratic acts of controlling the voting machines in the United Nations are not stopped, the United Nations cannot function as a true world organization.

    The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution on international issues.

    Eight thousand representatives and guests attended the opening meeting.

    尼赫鲁和梅农在印度国大党年会发言
    裁军谈判必须有苏中两国参加
    抨击美国载氢弹飞机在西欧日夜飞行
    新华社高哈蒂18日电　据新华社讯：印度总理尼赫鲁今天在这里举行的印度国大党第六十三届年会上讨论国际问题决议案时说，如果没有苏联和中国参加，世界裁军谈判就将是不真实的。
    尼赫鲁总理在发言中说，无论人们喜欢还是不喜欢它，中国是一个强大的国家。奇怪的是，这样一个强大的国家竟被当作“世界的贱民”被排斥在裁军会谈之外。他指出，中国的力量正在一天天强大起来。他说，“如果把中国排除在外，那就不能举行有效的真正的裁军谈判”。
    尼赫鲁总理指出，世界今天像“危险地站在刀剑的锋刃上面”一样。裁军对于缓和国际紧张局势具有极其重要的意义。
    尼赫鲁总理还尖锐地抨击了美国的行动，因为美国曾经命令它在欧洲的飞机带着氢弹日夜飞行。尼赫鲁总理说，最令人遗憾的是，今天人类的命运竟然系于带着氢弹的美国轰炸机的机长的判断，他的任何错误都可能引起一场世界大战。尼赫鲁总理说，在这样紧张的情况下，像印度这样的国家对于有效地保持世界和平，能够起它们的作用。
    印度国防部长梅农也在会议上表示了类似的意见。他说，带着氢弹的美国轰炸机在西欧飞行并不是为了缓和国际紧张局势，而是为了准备战争。梅农说，虽然最近世界的紧张局势有某些缓和，但是情况还没有令人安心。紧张局势任何进一步的恶化就将导致战争。因此，世界裁军就成为迫切需要解决的问题。梅农还说，“裁军并不是和平，但是一旦实现了裁军，和平就应该会接着到来。”他指出，以前的联合国裁军谈判的机构是有缺陷的，这就是裁军谈判今天陷于僵局的原因。他认为，如果苏联、美国和中国之间不达成协议，就不可能实现有效的裁军。梅农要求各大国举行裁军谈判。
    奥里萨邦政府首席部长马哈塔布在会上提出关于国际问题的决议案时说，有人仍在进行活动来剥夺真正的中国的代表权，从而把联合国变成了（美利坚）合众国。如果听任这种情况永远存在下去，那么世界就要完蛋了。他指出，假使不制止那些在联合国控制表决机器人的这种不民主的行为，联合国就不能作为一个真正的世界组织进行活动。
    会议一致通过了关于国际问题的决议案。
    参加这次开幕会议的有八千名代表和来宾。
