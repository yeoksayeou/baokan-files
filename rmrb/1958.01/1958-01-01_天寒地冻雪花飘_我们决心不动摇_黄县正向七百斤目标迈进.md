Huang County is Advancing Towards the 707 Jin per Mu Target

(Reported by our newspaper) The farmers of Huang County, Shandong Province, who were the first to achieve the 500 jin per mu average grain yield target set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), are now advancing towards the 1958 target of an average yield of 707 jin per mu. Every day, over 90% of the county's men and women are actively working on various fronts, including water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and wheat field management. "Freezing weather and snowfall, our resolve remains unshaken" is the bold declaration made by the vast number of commune members during their intense labor. Qijia Township, located in the deep mountains of the south, has always been considered a backward township, but during the winter production surge, it has leaped to become the vanguard of the entire county. In order to achieve the plan of eliminating 80% of dry land this winter and next spring, and producing 796 jin of grain per mu in 1958, the young men of each commune participating in water conservancy construction have simply moved their luggage to the mountains, built warm shelters near the construction site, and are living on the mountains to do as much work as possible before the freeze-up. Their slogans are: "High mountains are the battlefield, shovels and picks are weapons, determination is strength," and "We will not come down the mountain until the task is completed." Up to now, the county has expanded its irrigated area by 58,000 mu through well-digging, spring-tapping, and reservoir construction. The plan to accumulate 180,000 loads of fertilizer in 1958 has already been 75,000 loads. The 338,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated twice.

    天寒地冻雪花飘　我们决心不动摇
    黄县正向七百斤目标迈进
    本报讯　第一个实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）粮食平均亩产五百斤指标的山东省黄县农民，正在向1958年平均亩产七百零七斤的目标迈进。每天，全县90％以上的男女劳力，活跃在兴修水利、积肥、管理麦田的各个战线上。“天寒地冻雪花飘，我们的决心不动摇”，这是广大社员在紧张劳动中发出的豪语。处在南部深山中的七甲乡，一向被认为落后乡，在冬季生产高潮中，已经一跃而成为全县的先锋。为了实现今冬明春消灭旱地80％，1958年每亩产粮七百九十六斤的计划，全乡各社参加水利建设的小伙子们，索性把行李搬上山，在工地附近搭起了暖和的窝铺，住在山上，争取封冻以前多做些工。他们的口号是：“高山是战场，锨镢是刀枪，决心是力量”“完不成任务不下山”。截至目前为止，全县由于打井、下泉、修筑水库，已经扩大灌溉面积五万八千亩。1958年积肥十八万驮的计划，已经完成七万五千驮。三十三万八千亩麦田，已浇过两次水。
