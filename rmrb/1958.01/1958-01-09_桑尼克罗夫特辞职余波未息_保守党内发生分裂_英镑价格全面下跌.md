Xinhua News Agency, London, January 8th. The division within the British Cabinet over fiscal policy has caused confusion within the Conservative Party. The resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Thorneycroft and his two junior ministers, Birch and Powell, in protest against excessive government spending in the coming year is the culmination of this division. Within the Conservative Party, some Members of Parliament who openly support Thorneycroft are forming a group similar to the "Suez Rebels." Martin Madan, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire, publicly expressed his support for Thorneycroft's resignation and called on Conservative backbenchers to insist that the government implement Thorneycroft's fiscal proposals.

Birch, the former Economic Secretary to the Treasury who resigned along with Thorneycroft, accused Macmillan of failing to support Thorneycroft's fiscal measures and of not being prepared to "genuinely stop inflation."

"The Times" expressed its support for Thorneycroft. The "Daily Telegraph," which supports the government, acknowledged that a split has occurred within the Conservative Party because some Conservative MPs support Thorneycroft.

Financial figures here are anxiously discussing that Thorneycroft's resignation demonstrates the extreme instability of the British Treasury; Britain has changed four Chancellors of the Exchequer in just over two years. They fear that abroad, this instability will be seen as a sign of the pound's weakness.

On the 7th, the price of the pound on the London foreign exchange market had already fallen across the board due to the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

    桑尼克罗夫特辞职余波未息
    保守党内发生分裂　英镑价格全面下跌
    据新华社伦敦8日电　英国内阁在财政政策问题上所发生的分裂在保守党内部引起了混乱。财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特和他手下的两个次官伯奇和鲍威尔为了抗议明年度政府开支过大而辞职，是这种分裂达到顶点的表现。在保守党内部，一些公开表示支持桑尼克罗夫特的议员们正在组成类似“苏伊士反叛集团”的集团。赫弗德郡的保守党议员马丁·马丹公开表示支持桑尼克罗夫特辞职，并且呼吁保守党后座议员坚持要求政府执行桑尼克罗夫特的财政主张。
    同桑尼克罗夫特一起辞职的前财政部经济次官伯奇指责麦克米伦不支持桑尼克罗夫特的财政措施是不准备“真正停止通货膨胀”。
    “泰晤士报”表示支持桑尼克罗夫特。支持政府的“每日电讯报”承认，由于有一部分保守党议员支持桑尼克罗夫特，保守党内部已经发生分裂。
    此间财政界人士在担心地谈论着：桑尼克罗夫特的辞职显示出英国财政部是极不稳定的，在两年多一点的时间里，英国换了四个财政大臣。他们担心，在外国，这种不稳定会被认为是英镑软弱的一种表现。
    7日，伦敦外汇市场上的英镑价格已经由于财政大臣辞职而全面下跌。
