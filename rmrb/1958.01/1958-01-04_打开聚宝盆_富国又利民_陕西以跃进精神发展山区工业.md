Open the Treasure Bowl, Enrich the Country and Benefit the People
Shaanxi Develops Mountain Industries with Leap Forward Spirit

(Reported by this newspaper) During the First Five-Year Plan, medium and small industries and processing industries in the mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province have developed significantly. According to incomplete statistics, 214 various factories and enterprises have been built in the mountainous areas of the province; the variety of industrial products has increased by 50% to 100% compared with before liberation. In order to accelerate the economic construction of the mountainous areas, the relevant leading organs of Shaanxi Province and various special districts have put forward preliminary opinions on developing medium and small industrial enterprises in the mountainous areas during the Second Five-Year Plan, and have specifically arranged construction projects for 1958. The responsible persons of the relevant leading organs at the provincial level believe that the development of medium and small industrial enterprises in the mountainous areas should be carried out with the spirit of a great leap forward, just like the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry.

The mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province account for about 85% of the province's total area. Each mountainous area has abundant resources for developing light industry and small mines. However, before liberation, these mountainous areas had only a few small industrial enterprises, which were often shut down. Even the daily necessities most needed by the people in the mountainous areas (such as matches and paper) could not be supplied. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government strengthened the leadership of mountain industries, enabling the rapid recovery and construction of medium and small factories and mines in the mountainous areas. In the past few years, factories and mines built in various mountainous areas include paper mills, power plants, farm tool factories, leather factories, match factories, food processing plants, and small coal mines, iron mines, copper mines, and asbestos mines. The output of these small factories and mines has also increased significantly. According to incomplete statistics, the annual total output of small coal kilns has reached 600,000 tons, the annual output of native paper is 1,400 tons, flour is 6,500 tons, and edible oil is 1,500 tons. The output of some products has increased more than tenfold compared with before liberation.

These small factories and mines have become an important part of the mountain economy, playing a significant role in supplying the daily needs of the people in the mountains and supporting agricultural and forestry production in the mountains. Small farm tool factories in Ankang, Hanzhong, and other places not only supply a large number of farm tools to local farmers every year, but also often repair farm tools for farmers. The paper mill in Zhenba County produces 200 tons of paper annually. The raw materials used in the factory are reed stalks purchased from farmers, and the paper produced is mainly supplied to local farmers. These small factories and mines in the mountainous areas have also strongly supported the country's economic construction. A large part of the coal produced by small coal kilns is used for industrial production; other materials such as the Da'an Asbestos Mine and the Shiquan Vegetable Tannin Factory have also provided a large amount of raw materials for national production and construction. The state-owned Shiquan Vegetable Tannin Factory also exports hundreds of tons of tannin annually.

The Second Congress of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized the need to build mountainous areas with revolutionary vigor and the heroic spirit of "no mountain is higher than the hoe, and no stone is harder than the hammer;" and pointed out that the mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province are still untapped "treasure bowls," calling on all party members in the province to pay attention to the construction of mountainous areas. In accordance with this spirit, the responsible persons of the relevant organs of Shaanxi Province and various special districts recently went deep into the mountainous areas to investigate and understand the resource situation for developing mountain industries, and found many raw materials and mineral deposits that can be used to develop small factories and mines. For example, in Hanzhong Special District, the annual output of reed stalks is more than 14.4 million catties, ramie is more than 4.4 million catties, and acorns are more than 15 million catties, all of which are raw materials needed by light industrial factories. The asbestos in the Da'an area is estimated to be more than 10 million tons. The gold mines in Lueyang, Mianxian, and Xixiang are quite rich. More than eighty taels of gold nuggets have been discovered in Maying Village, Mianxian in the past. Wang Jie, Secretary of the Shangluo Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, collected more than 20 kinds of wild oil crops and 60 to 70 kinds of ores such as gold, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, mercury, and beryl himself.

At present, many regions have put forward plans for developing small industrial enterprises in mountainous areas, and have specifically arranged construction projects for 1958. For example, Hanzhong Special District has put forward dozens of construction projects, including small iron mines with an annual output of 3,000 to 10,000 tons, phosphate mines, copper mines, power plants, paper mills, flour mills, oil presses, food processing plants, etc., of which more than ten small factories and mines have been identified for construction in 1958.

    打开聚宝盆  富国又利民
    陕西以跃进精神发展山区工业
    本报讯　第一个五年计划期间，陕西省山区的中、小型工业和加工业有了显著的发展。据不完全统计，全省山区已经建成的各种工厂企业有二百一十四个；各种工业产品比解放以前增长50％到100％。为了加速山区的经济建设，陕西省省级和各专区的有关领导机关已经提出了第二个五年计划期间在山区发展中、小型工业企业的初步意见，并且具体安排了1958年的建设项目。省级有关领导机关的负责人认为，应该像发展农业、林业和畜牧业一样，以跃进的精神来发展山区的中、小型工业企业。
    陕西省的山区约占全省面积的85％，每个山区都有发展轻工业和小型矿场的丰富资源。但是，解放以前，这些山区只有少数的小型工业企业，而且经常停工，连山区人民最需要的日用品（如火柴、纸张等）都供应不上。解放以后，党和人民政府加强了对山区工业的领导，使山区的中、小型厂矿迅速地恢复和建设起来。几年来，各地山区建设的厂矿有造纸厂、发电厂、农具厂、皮革厂、火柴厂、食品加工厂和小型的煤矿、铁矿、铜矿、石棉矿等。这些小型厂矿的产量也有显著的提高。根据不完全的统计，小型煤窑的每年总产量已经有六十万吨，土纸年产量为一千四百吨，面粉六千五百吨，食油一千五百吨。有些产品的产量比解放以前增加了十多倍。
    这些小型厂矿已经成为山区经济的一个重要组成部分，对供应山区人民的生活需要，支援山区农、林业生产起了不小作用。安康、汉中等地的小型农具厂，每年除把大批农具供给当地农民以外，还经常为农民修理农具。镇巴县的纸厂年产二百吨纸。厂里用的原料是从农民那里收购来的龙须草，制造出来的纸又主要供应给当地农民。这些山区小型厂矿还有力地支援了国家的经济建设。小型煤窑生产的煤就有很大一部分用于工业生产；其它如大安石棉矿、石泉植物鞣料厂等也都向国家提供了大量生产建设原料。国营石泉植物鞣料厂每年还有数百吨鞣料出口。
    中共陕西省第二届代表大会曾经强调要以革命的干劲，以“山高没有锄头高，石硬没有铁锤硬”的英雄气概来建设山区；指出陕西省的山区是还没有打开的“聚宝盆，”号召全省党员重视山区的建设。根据这一精神，陕西省省级和各专区有关机关的负责人最近深入山区，调查了解了发展山区工业的资源情况，找到了许多可以发展小型厂矿的原料和矿藏。例如在汉中专区，每年出产龙须草一千四百多万斤，苎麻四百多万斤，橡子一千五百多万斤，这都是轻工业工厂需要的原料。大安一带的石棉，估计约有一千多万吨。略阳、沔县、西乡等地的金矿相当丰富，沔县马营村过去曾经发现过八十多两重的金块。中共商雒地委书记王杰就自己搜集了二十多种野生油料作物，和金、镍、钼、钒、水银、绿柱石等六、七十种矿石。
    目前，许多地区已经提出了发展山区小型工业企业的规划，具体安排了1958年的建设项目。例如汉中专区已经提出了几十个建设项目，其中有年产三千吨到一万吨的小型铁矿，有磷肥矿、铜矿，有发电厂、纸厂、面粉厂、榨油厂、食品加工厂等，其中已经确定在1958年建设的就有十多个小型厂矿。
