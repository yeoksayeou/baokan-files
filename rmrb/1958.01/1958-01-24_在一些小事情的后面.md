Behind Some Small Matters

What lies before you are some small matters that could happen in any family. Because they are small matters, they are often overlooked. However, parents haven't noticed the bad influence that occurs behind these small matters! They are like invisible germs, corroding the hearts of children—many of children’s bad habits are produced in this way.

Dear parents, like preventing diseases, pay attention to the small things happening around you!

Such "Encouragement"

On his way home from school, Weiwei met his good friend Xiaoning, and as usual, a tense football match began. Weiwei and Xiaoning kicked back and forth, sweating all over. More and more spectators gathered, and it was very lively. While they were in high spirits, Xiaoning missed a kick and accidentally kicked Weiwei. Weiwei immediately burst into tears and ran home. Xiaoning quickly followed, hoping to apologize to him. But Weiwei ran too fast, and Xiaoning couldn't catch up.

Weiwei ran home crying, and his grandmother rushed out of the kitchen, asking anxiously, "What's wrong? Did you fall? Where does it hurt?" Weiwei said, "No, Xiaoning kicked me." When his grandmother heard that her grandson had been bullied, she immediately said without asking the details, "If he kicks you once, you kick him twice. Don't think our Weiwei is easy to bully." After being encouraged by his grandmother, Weiwei stopped crying and immediately ran out, found Xiaoning, and kicked Xiaoning in the butt twice. From then on, Xiaoning never played football with Weiwei again, and none of the children in the yard wanted to be friends with Weiwei. Gradually, Weiwei became a lonely person.

When children play together, small misunderstandings and conflicts may arise, but adults should provide fair and reasonable analysis to distinguish right from wrong. Children should be taught to boldly admit and recognize their mistakes, and they should also be taught to have a spirit of collectivism, unity, friendship, mutual help, and mutual understanding. It is not good for children to be afraid that they will suffer losses and to always want to be above others. (Jue Min)

Pouring Cold Water

Mom wasn't home, and the children were playing happily in the house. They moved some small stools together to form a train, and put toys, blocks, bottles, small quilts...etc. on the train. The boy was sitting in the front as the driver, the little girl was holding a doll made of a small pillow on the train, and another boy was standing aside like a stationmaster, saying, "The train is leaving." So, the boy acting as the driver started to imitate the train's sound, "Woo—choo-choo..."

The children were having fun when Mom came back. She opened the door and saw, oh dear, the bed and the floor were a mess. Mom was furious, slammed the things in her hand on the table, and yelled at the children, "You are simply rebelling when I'm not home! What a mess you've made of the house! Get out of here!"

How disrespectful this mother is to her children! She not only failed to develop their intelligence from their activities but also poured cold water on their creativity. (Yin Zhongxi)

Is Beating and Scolding Useful?

Among the six families living in our courtyard, four have children, all eight or nine years old. It's a good thing that some children in the same yard are lively and bustling; but sooner or later, all we hear is scolding and crying. Before this crying stops, scolding starts over there, the mother's roar and the child's scream blending into one.

"You won't learn to be good, you just know how to scold people, you short-lived ghost!"

"You're the short-lived ghost!" the son retorts to his mother.

——This is a mother scolding her child for cursing.

"Why did you hit your younger brother? You, watch me pull off your ears."

"You dare! I'm going to tell the teacher you hit someone."

"Good! See if I dare. Report me, report me, go ahead and report!" Before she finished speaking, the sound of slapping and the child's crying were heard.

——This is another mother scolding her child for hitting his younger brother.

Although this situation continues and repeats every day, the child has not improved. Because rough scolding and coercive measures cannot educate children well. (Dong Zhang)

"Example"

Aunt Zhang's Xiao Hua is eight years old this year. She is very pretty, with big black eyes, a chubby face, and a clever little mouth, which is loved by everyone. Unfortunately, this smart child is no longer liked—Xiao Hua has learned to lie.

This is how it started:

One day at noon, Xiao Hua came home from school. As soon as she put down her schoolbag, she heard someone calling outside, "Aunt Zhang, please come to Old Chen's house in the east courtyard at three o'clock for a meeting." It was the voice of the women's committee member, Aunt Li. "Aunt Li, I'm not feeling well today and can't attend." Aunt Li left unhappily, saying as she walked, "It's okay not to have a meeting, but as soon as there's a meeting, there's trouble..." After Aunt Li left, Mom said to herself, "Who wants to go to a meeting? I'd rather lie down for a while." These words were imprinted on the child's mind word by word.

Another day, Xiao Hua said to her mother, "Give me money to buy a pencil." "What happened to the pencil I bought for you the day before yesterday?" "I lost it." "Why aren't you more careful? Here's the money, but if you lose it again, I won't give you any more." Xiao Hua vaguely agreed and ran away jumping. She used the money she tricked from her mother to buy candy. Xiao Hua's act of deceiving money was discovered by her mother. Her mother slapped her a few times and asked, "Do you dare to lie next time?" Xiao Hua said理直气壮 "Why do you lie too?"

### 在一些小事情的后面

    在一些小事情的后面
    摆在你们面前的，是一些在每个家庭里都可能发生的小事情。既然是小事情，往往被人们忽略过去。然而，做父母的没有注意到，就在这些小事情的后面，发生了多么不好的影响啊！它们像看不见的病菌一样，侵蚀着孩子们的心灵——孩子们的许多恶习就这样产生了。
    亲爱的家长们，像预防疾病一样，注意你身边发生的小事情吧！
    如此“鼓励”
    伟伟放学回家的路上，遇见好朋友小宁，和往常一样，一场紧张的足球赛开始了。伟伟和小宁你一脚来，我一脚去，踢得满身大汗。小观众愈来愈多，热闹极了。正在兴高采烈的时候，小宁踢球未中，误踢了伟伟一脚。伟伟立即大哭起来，跑回家去。小宁赶紧跟上，希望向他道歉。但伟伟跑得太快，小宁没有赶得上。
    伟伟边哭边跑回家，奶奶从厨房里三步两脚跑出来，赶忙问“怎么回事？?跤了？跌疼那里哪？”伟伟说“不是，小宁踢了我一脚”。奶奶一听孙子给别人欺侮了，不问青红皂白，马上说“他踢你一脚，你就踢他两脚，别以为我们伟伟是好欺侮的。”伟伟给奶奶这么一鼓励，不哭了，马上跑出去，找到小宁，朝着小宁屁股就是两脚。从此，小宁再也不和伟伟踢足球了，院子里的小朋友谁也不和伟伟做朋友，渐渐地伟伟变成孤零零的一个人了。
    孩子们在一起玩，有时是会引起一些小的误会和冲突，但大人应该公平合理地给以分析，辨别谁是谁非。要教育孩子大胆的承认和认识错误，也要教育孩子有集体主义的精神，团结友爱、彼此帮助、互相体谅。唯恐自己的孩子吃了亏，处处要站在别人的头上，这样对孩子是没有好处的。　（珏民）
    泼冷水
    妈妈不在家，孩子们在屋里兴高采烈地玩起来了。他们把一些小凳子搬在一起凑成一列火车，把玩具、木块、瓶子、小被褥……等，都放在火车上。男孩子坐在前头当司机，小女孩抱着一个用小枕头做的娃娃坐在火车上，另一个男孩子站在一边像是站长的样子说：“开车了”。于是，当司机的男孩子就学火车头叫起来“嘟——嗵嗵哧哧……”。
    孩子们正玩得高兴，妈妈回来了。推开门一看，唉呀，床上、地上搞得乱七八糟。妈妈一肚子气，把手里的东西噹啷一声向桌子上一摔，对着孩子们大声叫嚷：“我不在家，你们简直造反了，屋里搞成什么样了？都给我滚出去！”
    这位妈妈对待孩子多么不尊重呀！她不但没有注意从孩子们的各项活动中发展他们的智力，而且对孩子们的创造性泼了一瓢冷水。　（殷忠席）
    打骂有用吗？
    住在我们院子里的六家人中，四家有孩子，都是八、九岁的孩子。同院里有些孩子热热闹闹的，这本是挺好的事；可是早早晚晚，听到的不是叫骂，就是哭闹。这头哭声没停，那边又传来了责骂，母亲的怒吼和孩子的尖叫嚷成一片。
    “你不学好，就会骂人，短命鬼！”
    “你是短命鬼！”儿子回敬母亲。
    ——这是一位母亲在责备孩子骂人。
    “为什么打弟弟？你，看我揪掉你的耳朵”。
    “你敢！我要告诉老师，你打人。”
    “好！看我敢不敢。告我，告我，你去告吧！”话音没落，就听到手掌噼啪声和孩子的哭叫。
   ——这是责备孩子不该打弟弟的另一位母亲。
    尽管这种情形天天都在继续，都在重复，可是孩子并没有变好。因为粗暴的叫骂和强制手段，并不能把孩子教育好。（董璋）
    “榜样”
    张大嫂家里的小华今年八岁，长得挺好看，两只大大的黑眼睛，胖胖的脸蛋，小嘴可巧啦，到处逗人喜欢。可惜这个聪明的孩子，现在不讨人喜欢了——小华学会了撒谎。
    事情是这样开始的：
    一天中午，小华放学回家，刚放下书包，就听到外面有人叫道：“张大嫂，下午三点请你到东院老陈家开会。”这是妇女委员李大婶的声音。“李大婶呀，我今天有点不舒服，不能去参加了。”李大婶不高兴地连走带说：“不开会没事，一开会就有事……。”李大婶走了以后，妈妈自言自语地说：“谁愿去开会，没事我还躺一会呢。”这些话一字一句地印在孩子的心灵上。
    又一天，小华对妈妈说“给我钱买铅笔。”“前天给你买的铅笔呢？”“丢了。”“你为什么不小心点，给你钱，再丢了可不让你。”小华含糊地答应着，连蹦带跳地跑走了。她把从妈妈那里骗来的钱买糖吃了。小华骗钱的行为被妈妈发现了，妈妈打了他几下，责问：“你下次还敢说谎不？”小华理直气壮地说：“你怎么也说谎呢？”
