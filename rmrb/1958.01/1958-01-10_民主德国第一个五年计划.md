Steel production had increased from 200,000 tons in 1948 to 2.5 million tons in 1955, and power generation reached 30 billion kilowatt-hours, ranking second among socialist countries, second only to the Soviet Union.

In agriculture, the total agricultural output increased by 44% during the Five-Year Plan period, and the socialist sector of agriculture increased from 7% in 1950 to 29% in 1955.

During the five years, the labor productivity of industrial workers increased by 54%, the average wage of workers increased by 48%, and the national income increased by 62%.
