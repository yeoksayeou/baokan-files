    In his answer to a question from the Associated Press reporter on December 29, 1957, President Sukarno once again expressed the solemn position of the Indonesian people against Dutch colonial aggression and demanding the recovery of West Irian. He powerfully clarified politically, historically, and legally that the struggle to recover West Irian is completely legitimate and just, and reiterated that all problems with the Netherlands should be resolved within the United Nations. President Sukarno's remarks greatly encouraged the Indonesian people's determination and confidence in carrying out the struggle, and excited all those who care about and support Indonesia.
    In order to strengthen the struggle to recover West Irian and safeguard Indonesia's national sovereignty and national interests, the Indonesian government has recently taken a series of measures. It has taken over many Dutch colonial enterprises in Indonesia, including: the Royal Dutch Shipping Company, the three major Dutch banks, and all Dutch plantations. At the same time, the Indonesian government announced that the seas around Indonesian islands, between Indonesian islands, and on the surface of the islands, are all part of Indonesia's inland or territorial seas within its sovereign territory.
    People see that on the one hand, the Dutch colonialists occupy Indonesian territory, infringe upon Indonesian sovereignty, and do everything possible to implement policies against and subverting Indonesia; on the other hand, they still want to preserve their economic privileges in Indonesia and do not allow Indonesia to touch a hair on their heads. On the one hand, they dispatch warships to West Irian and other Indonesian waters to threaten Indonesia with force; on the other hand, they still want to prevent Indonesia from safeguarding its own sovereignty over territorial waters. The Dutch colonialists are simply dreaming eighteenth-century dreams. It should be known that it is now the twentieth century, and colonialists cannot get away with things in today's world. As President Sukarno said, this contradiction between Indonesia and the Netherlands cannot continue. Therefore, the Indonesian government and people have taken resolute patriotic actions. They did the right thing, and they did it well!
    Recently, the Dutch colonialists are colluding with the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, attempting to rely on the joint intervention of imperialism to intimidate the Indonesian people. To achieve this goal, they are desperately distorting the Indonesian people's struggle, calling it an "anti-foreign movement." This distortion is, of course, not worth refuting. The current struggle of the Indonesian people is a patriotic movement to recover their territory of West Irian and to safeguard their independent sovereignty. This movement undoubtedly receives the sympathy and support of all people with a sense of justice. The Indonesian people are only opposed to the aggressive forces of Dutch colonialists, not all Dutch people or all foreigners. Therefore, the clamor of Western imperialists is nothing more than preparing an excuse for their intervention.
    If the Western colonialists think that this can intimidate the Indonesian people, they are overestimating themselves. The facts of the past few months have proved that the nationally unified action taken by Indonesia has greatly enhanced its own strength and打击 the power of Dutch colonialism. As Prime Minister Djuanda said, "Our position has been strengthened in the struggle to recover West Irian." The Indonesian people have already won significant victories in this struggle, and no force can stop them from continuing to move forward.
    Of course, any nation that has suffered from imperialist oppression for a long time will encounter various difficulties when it stands up and resolutely sweeps away imperialist aggressive forces. However, this difficulty is only temporary, because it is a difficulty in progress, a difficulty in victory, and it can be completely overcome. Imperialism headed by the United States is doing its best to exaggerate and publicize this difficulty, trying to thwart Indonesia's will to struggle, which is in vain. According to the logic of the American masters, it seems that without the colonialists, the Indonesian people cannot survive. But everyone knows that the opposite is true. The sooner the colonial masters get out, the better the people's lives will be. We believe that the heroic Indonesian people will be able to overcome all difficulties and carry out the anti-colonial struggle to the end, thereby winning their own beautiful future.
    The Indonesian people have friends all over the world. This is a strong guarantee that the Indonesian people will achieve final victory. As President Sukarno said, two billion people in the world support Indonesia's struggle. The ongoing Asian-African Solidarity Conference has issued a call to support Indonesia. In other parts of the world, all peace-loving and freedom-loving people also support Indonesia. At the same time, the Indonesian people's struggle has promoted the anti-colonial movement of people all over the world and greatly helps to consolidate world peace.
    Our people deeply admire the heroic struggle of the Indonesian people, and our 600 million Chinese people stand entirely on the side of the Indonesian people. At this time of year, let us extend our fraternal greetings to the Indonesian people in their patriotic struggle and wish them even greater victories in the new year.

    向印度尼西亚人民致敬！
    1957年12月29日，苏加诺总统在答合众社记者问时，又一次表示了印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民侵略和要求收复西伊里安的严正立场。他从政治上、历史上和法律上有力地阐明了收复西伊里安的斗争是完全合法的和正义的，并重申要在联合国外解决同荷兰之间的全部问题。苏加诺总统的这次谈话，大大地鼓舞了印度尼西亚人民进行斗争的决心和信心，并且使一切关心和支持印度尼西亚的人们都感到兴奋。
    为了加强收复西伊里安的斗争，为了维护印度尼西亚的国家主权和民族利益，印度尼西亚政府最近期间采取了一系列措施。它接管了荷兰殖民者在印度尼西亚的许多企业，其中包括：荷兰皇家轮船公司，荷兰的三大银行，以及全部荷兰的种植园。同时，印度尼西亚政府宣布，围绕印度尼西亚各岛屿的、在印度尼西亚各岛屿之间和岛屿的海面，都是印度尼西亚主权范围内的内海或领海的一部分。
    人们都看到，荷兰殖民者一方面霸占着印度尼西亚的领土，侵犯印度尼西亚的主权，并且千方百计地实行反对和颠复印度尼西亚的政策，另一方面却还想保存他们在印度尼西亚的经济特权，不许印度尼西亚触动他们的一根毫毛。他们一方面调遣军舰到西伊里安和印度尼西亚其他海面附近活动，用武力威胁印度尼西亚，另一方面却还想不许印度尼西亚维护自己关于领海的主权。荷兰殖民者简直是在做着十八世纪的美梦。须知现在是二十世纪，今天世界上殖民者是吃不开了。正如苏加诺总统所说，印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的这种矛盾是不能够再继续下去了。因此，印度尼西亚政府和人民采取了坚决的爱国行动。他们做得对，做得好！
    最近，荷兰殖民者正与以美国为首的帝国主义集团相勾结，企图依靠帝国主义的共同干涉，来吓倒印度尼西亚人民。为了达到这个目的，他们正在拚命歪曲印度尼西亚人民的斗争，把它说成是“排外运动”。这种歪曲当然是不值一驳的。印度尼西亚人民目前的斗争，是为了收复他们的领土西伊里安，为了维护他们的独立主权的爱国运动。这个运动毫无疑问得到一切有正义感的人们的同情和支持。印度尼西亚人民反对的只是荷兰殖民者的侵略势力，而不是一切荷兰人或一切外国人。因此，西方帝国主义者的叫嚣，不过是为他们的干涉准备借口而已。
    如果西方殖民者以为这样就可以吓倒印度尼西亚人民，那是太不自量了。几个月来的事实证明，印度尼西亚所采取的全国一致的行动，已经大大地增强了自己的力量，打击了荷兰殖民主义的势力。正如朱安达总理所说，“在收复西伊里安的斗争中，我们的地位已经加强了。”印度尼西亚人民在这场斗争中已经得到了重大的胜利，没有任何力量能够阻挡他们继续前进。
    当然，任何一个长期遭受帝国主义压迫的民族，当它站了起来坚决扫除帝国主义侵略势力的时候，总会碰到各种各样的困难。然而，这种困难只是暂时的，因为它是前进中的困难，是胜利中的困难，它是完全可以克服的。以美国为首的帝国主义正竭力夸大宣传这种困难，想要借此来挫折印度尼西亚的斗争意志，这是白费的。按照美国老爷们的逻辑，好像没有殖民者，印度尼西亚人民就不能过活似的。但是谁都知道，事情恰恰相反，殖民老爷们滚蛋得越早，人民的日子就越能过得好。我们相信，英雄的印度尼西亚人民一定能够克服一切困难，把反殖民主义斗争进行到底，从而赢得自己的美好的未来。
    印度尼西亚人民的朋友遍于全世界。这是印度尼西亚人民将会获得最后胜利的一个有力保证。正如苏加诺总统说的，世界上有二十亿人民支持印度尼西亚的斗争。正在举行的亚非团结大会，已经发出了支持印度尼西亚的呼声。在世界其他各地，一切爱好和平与自由的人民也都是支持印度尼西亚的。同时，印度尼西亚人民的斗争又推动了全世界人民的反殖民主义运动，并且大大有助于巩固世界和平。
    我国人民对于印度尼西亚人民的英勇斗争感到十分钦佩，我们六亿中国人民完全站在印度尼西亚人民这一边。在此岁序更新之际，让我们向在爱国斗争中的印度尼西亚人民致兄弟的敬礼，并祝他们在新的一年中获得更大的胜利。
