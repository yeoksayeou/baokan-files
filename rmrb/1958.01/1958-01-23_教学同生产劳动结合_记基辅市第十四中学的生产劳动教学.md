    Combining Teaching with Productive Labor
    ——On the Productive Labor Teaching at No. 14 Middle School in Kiev
    By our reporter, Dai Feng
    On a rare sunny winter day in southern Soviet Union, a reporter from the Romanian newspaper “Spark” and I visited No. 14 Middle School in Kiev.
    It’s a four-story red brick building. Walking through the school gate and up the stone steps, you arrive at a long corridor. Sunlight streamed through the windows, making the corridor particularly bright. At this time, the students were in class, and the surroundings were silent. As soon as we entered the corridor, we were attracted by an unusual sight. A row of glass cases lined the white walls on both sides, displaying various machine parts of different sizes: gears, ball bearings, spindles, hammers, rulers... Each finished product was meticulously filed and polished. If it weren't for the fact that the names of the makers, students in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, were labeled below each finished product, we would never have believed that these finished products were made by middle school students. In another row of glass cases, there were exquisite embroideries, wooden utensils, etc., with the names of third and fourth-grade students written on them.
    We were engrossed in watching when Principal Naumiko came over and met us. He led us to his office and sat down. On his desk, we saw, in addition to a pile of textbooks and notebooks, a hammer, a ruler, a screwdriver, and a two-way conversation device for amplification and paging, all handmade by a tenth-grade student.
    "Our school has been implementing labor production education courses for five years," Naumiko began his talk, "Now we can say that the combination of general knowledge education courses and labor production courses is the best way to cultivate a new type of socialist intellectual youth who are conscious, love labor, and are cultured.”
    Kiev No. 14 Middle School has more than 1,300 students. In order to cultivate students into knowledgeable working youth, the school started implementing on-campus labor classes in 1951, as the first experimental school in Ukraine after the war. The teachers' initiative was supported by the Party committee and the factory. The workers sent the school pliers, hammers, and other production tools, and helped build a small workshop. The district committee helped open up two hectares of land outside the school as a cultivation experimental field for school agricultural production.
    Kiev No. 14 Middle School is the same as general middle schools: it teaches for six hours a day, and the teaching materials and teaching plans are the same. The only difference is that students in the first to fourth grades have two hours of manual labor class per week, students in the fifth to seventh grades have four hours of labor class in small workshops and agricultural experimental fields per week, and students in the eighth to tenth grades go directly to the factory for one day (six hours) a week to participate in production.
    The students are very fond of labor classes. The school has one full-time engineer and one technician, each responsible for guiding the learning of labor classes. The school has a teaching plan for labor classes. Before the small workshop starts filing and sawing metal, the teacher first explains the properties of various metal plates, how to use tools, how to draw and make drawings, and so on. The labor class carried out in the agricultural experimental field is soil cultivation, sowing various grains, technical crops, cultivating flowers and plants, and fruit trees. Senior students participate in production in factories. Each student is led and guided by skilled workers, and they practice production in various workshops.
    The principal told us that middle school students who have not yet stepped out of the school gate are most apt to imagine what kind of person they will become in the future. Many desirable occupations attract them. Some imagine flying into the sky to fly airplanes; some imagine going to the ocean to drive ships. Therefore, it is very important to help students choose their future careers in middle school, and the establishment of labor production courses is to help solve this problem. – This is one aspect.
    On the other hand, in reality, not all middle school graduates can go to university to continue their studies. Most of the graduates have to go to factories and rural areas to engage in productive labor. The implementation of comprehensive labor education can help students master certain production skills and create conditions for them to freely choose their occupations and participate in productive labor. In short, the implementation of labor education courses is a necessity of life for the new era of intellectual youth.
    The more Naumiko spoke, the more energetic he became. He continued: "From our practical experience, there are roughly three aspects of gain: First, after implementing labor classes, the students love labor more, especially in the last three years. Students work with skilled workers to cultivate good labor habits; second, students master certain modern production technologies; third, they improve and consolidate general subject knowledge.”
    In recent years, most of the graduates of Kiev No. 14 Middle School have volunteered to go to factories as workers. In 1957, there were forty-one graduates, of whom thirty-two went to factories as fitters, turners, and milling workers.
    "Then, will the implementation of labor education courses affect the normal learning of general knowledge courses?" we asked.
    "Not only does it not affect it, but it powerfully helps consolidate general knowledge courses," the principal replied.
    It can be seen from the actual teaching in Kiev No. 14 Middle School that labor education courses must be carried out on the basis of general knowledge education courses and science education. Students obtain abstract concepts of chemistry, mathematics, and physics from textbooks, and then consolidate and improve them through practice.
    The students' academic performance is getting better and better. They are more profound and specific in answering questions, and they can use their own production practice to enrich their answers. More than 95% of the math and drawing test scores are five or four points, and there are no failures. Labor education has become intuitive teaching, greatly reducing the difficulty for students in learning and consolidating difficult to understand topics.
    The tenth-grade graduation examination in this school is conducted in two parts. One part is general courses, and the other part is labor courses. The labor course examination has a special examination committee, whose members include factory engineers and skilled workers. At the end of the examination, passing students are issued two certificates, one of which is a technical level appraisal. Graduates can work in any factory at the assessed level with the certificate. This ordinary school has cultivated hundreds of skilled and excellent young workers for various factories.
    The conversation came to an end, and Naumiko took us to visit the small workshop in the school.
    This small workshop is located in a large room on the ground floor of the school building. As soon as the door opened, there was a burst of metallic clanging. There are ten workbenches here, each workbench equipped with two pliers and a drawing rack. The tables are filled with steel files, steel saws, compasses, steel rulers, sandpaper, pencils, and so on. In the right corner of the wall are two small lathes given to the school by the factory, as well as an electric grinding wheel and a drilling machine. At this time, a group of sixth-grade students were in class: filing wheel teeth and hammers. More than a dozen boys and girls were intently standing in front of the pliers working, and they were all very skilled in using various tools. Some students gathered together in twos and threes to discuss with each other.
    We walked up to a little girl wearing a red scarf. Her name was Badawa, twelve years old. She was staring intently at the hammerhead being filed. We asked her how long it would take to file a hammerhead with one pointed end and one square end.
    "Four hours, or even more," she replied.
    "Isn't that almost equal to the technical level of a skilled worker?"
    She told us, blushing, that she was a little afraid when she first used a steel file to file parts, afraid of filing her fingers, afraid of not filing well... Now she is no longer afraid of the sharp-cornered file. In her own words, "It already listens to my command."
    "I have fallen in love with the work of filing metal, and I will be a fitter in the future," she finally said to us.
    Workshop teacher (technician) Alinov told us that planned labor class learning enables students to quickly master basic production skills. Having said that, he casually picked up two curved movable rulers from the table and asked us: "Look, which one was made by a student, and which one was bought on the market?"
    We unanimously pointed to the ruler with a very smooth surface and were sure that it was bought.
    "Wrong!" The children laughed.
    Our faces turned red. We were surprised by the exquisite craftsmanship that the students had learned in a short period of time.
    Enthusiastic Alinov opened the large wall cabinet again. Layers upon layers of machine parts and tools made by the students were placed there. The principal said: When students go to the countryside every year to help the agricultural cooperatives with harvesting, they give their finished products as gifts to the agricultural cooperative members.
    Because there was still extra time, Naumiko suggested that we go to the Kiev Film Equipment Manufacturing Factory to see the senior interns and the graduates of this school who are now working in the factory. The factory was not far from the school, and we walked there. Along the way, Naumiko talked about his past. He used to be a miner, and after joining the army, he became a car driver and electrician. After being discharged, he entered a normal school to study history. He said humorously, "My life experience tells me a truth: being able to do productive labor and understanding technology is very useful for intellectuals. Now I am the principal, a history teacher, and an electrician."
    In the front yard of the Kiev Film Equipment Factory workshop, we met the factory director and the engineer. The factory director said to us: "The graduates of No. 14 Middle School who come to work in the factory are all good: they work well, they have good discipline, they are cultured, they have a technical foundation, and they are willing to learn. In less than a year, they are all promoted to grade four or five workers.”
    The factory director accompanied us into the tool workshop. A young worker was working intently in front of an eight-foot lathe by the window. His name was Mikhlikeishi. He was a graduate of last year and is now a grade four turner. He was concentrating on turning a complex part.
    Mikhlikeishi told us that he had previously interned in this factory, and now coming to the factory as a turner is like returning home, and everything is familiar. After coming to the factory, he can work on the lathe alone. Except for the first month when he did not complete the task, he has now overfulfilled the production plan every month. He also mentioned that all the graduates who came to work in the factory are working very successfully.
    "I often think," Mikhlikeishi continued seriously, "I am a student who has just left middle school. Who made it possible for me to become a young worker without much difficulty at the beginning? When I complete the production tasks better and better, I will think even more that this is my alma mater, this is Naumiko, this is the skilled workers, they truly taught me the skills of life, the skills of serving the motherland."
    When we said goodbye to Naumiko, he said to us again: "In this regard, our school is just taking a step forward. In recent years, labor education has been universally implemented in middle schools throughout the Soviet Union. Especially in the past two years, this advanced teaching method of combining teaching with productive labor, which Lenin had already proposed, has been further promoted.”

    教学同生产劳动结合
    ——记基辅市第十四中学的生产劳动教学
    本报记者　戴枫
    是苏联南方冬季里一个罕有的大晴天，我和罗马尼亚“火花报”记者一起访问了基辅市第十四中学。
    这是一幢四层的红砖楼房。走进校门，踏上石阶，前面就是长长的走廊。阳光透过窗户射进来，走廊里格外显得明亮。这时，学生们正在上课，四周寂静无声。一进走廊，我们就被一种少见的景象吸引住了。两旁白墙上一排玻璃框里陈列着各种各样、尺寸不一的机器零件：齿轮、滚珠、轴心、铁锤、标尺……每件制成品都锉磨得十分精细。如果不是在制成品下面标写着制作者是七、八、九年级学生的话，我们决不会相信这些制成品是出于中学生之手的。在另一排玻璃框里，放着精美的刺绣、木制用具等等，上面写着三、四年级学生的姓名。
    我们正看得出神，校长纳乌米科走来和我们见了面。他把我们引到他的办公室里坐下来。在他的办公桌上，我们看见除了一堆教科书、本子之外，还放着铁锤、标尺、螺丝起子和一个十年级学生亲手制成的扩大和传呼两用对话机。
    “我们的学校实行劳动生产教育课已有五年历史了。”纳乌米科这样开始了自己的谈话：“现在可以这样说，普通知识教育课和劳动生产课相结合的教学，是培养有觉悟、爱劳动和有文化的社会主义新型知识青年的最好途径。”
    基辅市第十四中学有一千三百多个学生。为了培养学生成为有知识的劳动青年，从1951年起，作为乌克兰战后第一个试验性学校，开始实行校内劳动课。教师们的创举受到了党委和工厂的支持，工人们给学校送来了老虎钳、锤子等生产工具，帮助建起了一个小型工场。区委帮助在校外辟了两公顷土地作为学校农业生产的耕作实验场。
    基辅市第十四中学与一般中学一样：每天授课六小时，教材和教学计划也都是一样的。所不同的只是一年级到四年级的学生每星期有两小时的手工劳动课，五年级到七年级的学生每星期有四小时的小型工场和农业实验地的劳动课，八年级到十年级的学生每星期有一天（六小时）直接到工厂里去参加生产。
    同学们非常热爱劳动课。学校里有专职的工程师和技师各一名，负责指导劳动课的学习。学校订有劳动课的教学计划。小型工场开始锉锯金属之前，教师先要讲解各种金属板的性能，怎样运用工具，怎样绘图制作等等。农业实验场进行的劳动课是土壤耕作、播种各类谷物、技术作物、栽培花草和果树。高年级学生在工厂参加生产，每个学生都由熟练工人带领指导，在各车间实习生产。
    校长告诉我们说，还没有跨出学校大门的中学生，是最善于幻想着将来自己成为怎样一个人的。许许多多令人向往的职业吸引着他们，有的幻想飞上天空去驾驶飞机；有的幻想到海洋中去驾驶船只，因此，在中学里帮助同学们选择未来的职业是非常重要的事情，而劳动生产课的设立就是为了帮助解决这个问题的。——这是一方面。
    另一方面，实际上中学毕业生是不能全部升入大学继续念书的。大部分的毕业生要到工厂和农村去从事劳动生产，而实行综合性的劳动教育，能帮助同学们掌握一定的生产技能，为他们自由选择职业、参加劳动生产创造条件。总而言之，实行劳动教育课对新时代的知识青年是生活的必需。
    纳乌米科越说越有劲，他接着说：“从我们的实际经验中，大致上归结起来有三个方面的收获：一、实行劳动课后，同学们更热爱劳动了，特别是最后三年，学生与熟练工人一起劳动，培养起了良好的劳动习惯；二、使学生掌握了一定的现代生产技术；三、提高和巩固了普通学科知识。
    几年来，基辅市第十四中学的大部分毕业生都自愿到工厂当工人。1957年有四十一个毕业生，其中有三十二名进工厂当了钳工、旋工、铣工。
    “那末，实行劳动教育课会不会影响正常的普通知识课学习呢？”我们问。
    “不但不影响反而有力地帮助巩固了普通知识课。”校长回答说。
    从基辅市十四中学实际教学中可以看出：劳动教育课必须在普通知识教育课和科学教育基础上进行。学生们从课本上得到化学、数学、物理的抽象概念，再从实践中巩固提高。
    同学们的学习成绩越来越好了。在回答问题时更加深刻具体，他们能够从自己生产实践中得出的经验来充实自己的回答。数学、绘图的考试成绩95％以上得了五分或四分，没有不及格的。劳动教育成为直观性的教学，大大减轻了同学们在学习和巩固较难领会的课题时的困难。
    这个学校十年级毕业考试分两个部分进行。一部分是普通课程，另一部分是劳动课。劳动课考试设有专门的监考委员会，委员中有工厂工程师、熟练工人。最后考试及格的发给两张证书，其中一张是技术水平鉴定。毕业生凭证书可以在任何工厂按评定的级别做工。这所普通学校已为各工厂培养出了几百名熟练而优秀的青年工人。
    谈话告了一个段落，纳乌米科带着我们参观校内的小型工场。
    这个小型工场设在校舍底层的一间宽大房间里。一开门，顿时传出了一阵金属的铿锵声，这里设有十个工作台，每个工作台上装着两个老虎钳、图样架。桌上放着钢锉、钢锯、圆规、铁尺、砂布、铅笔等等。靠右墙角装有两架工厂送给学校的小车床，此外还有电动砂轮、钻眼机。这时，六年级一组同学们正在上课：锉轮齿和锤子。十多个男女学生都聚精会神地站在老虎钳前面工作着，他们都非常熟练地运用着各种工具。有的学生三三两两地聚集在一起相互讨论。
    我们走到一个带红领巾的小姑娘面前。她叫巴达娃，十二岁。她正目不转睛地注视着正在磨锉的锤头。我们问她锉一个一头尖角一头四方的锤头要用多少时间。
    “四小时，或者还多一些。”她回答。
    “那不是快等于熟练工人的技术水平了吗？”
    她红着脸告诉我们，开始，她拿钢锉锉零件时也是有些害怕的，怕锉破了手指，怕锉不好……。现在她再也不怕尖角的锉刀了。用她自己的话说：“它已经听我的指挥了。”
    “我已爱上锉金属这个活儿了，将来我会当钳工的。”她最后对我们说。
    工场教师（技师）阿里诺夫告诉我们，有计划的劳动课学习，使得同学们很快都掌握了基本的生产技能。说毕，他随手从桌上拿起两把弧形的活动标尺，问我们说：“你们看，哪一把是学生做的，哪一把是市场上买来的？”
    我们不约而同地用手指着那一把外表非常光滑的标尺，肯定它是买来的。
    “不对！”孩子们哄笑了起来。
    我们的脸红了。我们对同学们在短期内学到了精工手艺感到惊讶。
    热心的阿里诺夫又打开了大壁橱。那里一层叠一层地放着同学们制成的各式各样机器零件和工具。校长说：同学们在每年下乡帮助农庄收割时，都将自己的制成品作为礼物送给农庄庄员们。
    因为还有多余的时间，纳乌米科建议我们到基辅电影器材制造厂去，好看看高年级实习生和现在在工厂当工人的这个学校的毕业生。工厂离学校不远，我们是步行去的。一路上，纳乌米科讲起了自己的过去。他早先是个矿工，入伍后成了汽车司机和电工，复员后进了师范学校，研究历史。他颇有风趣地说：“我的一身经历告诉了我一条真理，能劳动生产，懂技术，这对知识分子非常有用。现在我是校长，也是历史教员，又是电工。”
    在基辅电影器材厂车间前院，我们会见了厂长和工程师。厂长对我们说：“来到工厂做工的十四中学的毕业生，个个都是好样的：劳动好，纪律好，有文化，有技术基础，肯学习，不上一年全升为四级或五级工了。”
    厂长陪着我们走进工具车间。一个青年工人正在靠窗的一架八尺车床前埋头工作。他叫米赫里凯西，是去年的毕业生，现在是四级旋工。他专心地旋着一个复杂的零件。
    米赫里凯西告诉我们，他早先就是在这个工厂实习的，现在来工厂当旋工，好像回老家一样，一切都熟悉。来厂后，他就能单独在车床上工作。除了开初一个月没有完成任务以外，现在已月月超额完成生产计划。他并且谈到所有来工厂工作的毕业生，都非常有成绩地劳动着。
    “我经常想，”米赫里凯西严肃地接着说：“我是刚刚离开中学的学生，是谁使我开头就没有多大困难地成了青年工人的呢？当我越来越好地完成生产任务的时候，我就更会想到这是我的母校，这是纳乌米科，这是熟练工人，是他们真正地教会了我生活的本领，为祖国服务的本领。”
    我们向纳乌米科告别的时候，他又对我们说：“在这方面，我们的学校不过是走先了一步。近年来苏联各地中学已普遍实行了劳动教育。尤其近两年，这一个先进的、列宁早已提出的教学同生产劳动结合的教学方法，更进一步地在推广。”
