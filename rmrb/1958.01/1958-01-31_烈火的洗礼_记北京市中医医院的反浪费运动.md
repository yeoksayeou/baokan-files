	Baptism of Fire
	——An Account of the Anti-Waste Movement at the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital
	Chen Daren
	Over a month ago, in the red building of the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, large character posters in red and green were pasted on every wall, upstairs and downstairs. The people of the entire hospital, with great excitement, raised thousands of criticisms to the hospital leadership. People who came here, when they realized that this building was originally a ward with fifty beds, couldn't help but ask in surprise: with such a shortage of beds, why is this place being used as a forum for airing views?

	The problem lies here. Starting with this issue, the flames of anti-waste began to burn in this building, incinerating all kinds of extravagance and waste in the hospital.

	"The moon shines bright on the nine continents, other hospitals are busy while we are idle, nurses in other hospitals are busy working, nurses in our hospital are guarding an empty building." This large character poster, put up by the nurses, was the first to expose the problems of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. The empty building refers to this red building, which is often empty without admitting patients, but is equipped with a full staff. Nurses have nothing to do, so they knit sweaters, read novels, and chat all day long, guarding this empty building. This hospital is not large, but it is equipped with full-time electricians, carpenters, plumbers, and even architectural design draftsmen. Statistical work that could be done by one person in two hours a day has three statisticians. The setup is very large, but no effort is made to meet the needs of patients. The hemorrhoid and fistula department has hundreds of patients waiting to be hospitalized, but the hospital leadership has not studied how to increase the number of beds and improve the bed turnover rate in this department for a long time. New patients need to make an appointment three months in advance to see a doctor, but the hospital has long implemented half-day outpatient clinics, and the other half-day is sometimes organized for study, and sometimes there is simply nothing to do, which the staff calls "free activity" time.

	In terms of equipment, the pursuit of modernization and showiness has caused serious waste of state funds. Using earthenware pots and coal fires to decoct medicine is economical and practical, and also in line with the habits of traditional Chinese medicine, but 872 yuan was spent to design and install a steam decoction pot. Because it was not suitable, it was dismantled, and then more than 4,700 yuan was spent to customize four electric decoction pots, which were not only unsuitable but also required frequent repairs of the heating wires, and imported goods were required. The daily electricity cost was 14 yuan. If coal fire was used, it would only cost more than 2 yuan a day. For acupuncture needles, silver needles are already the best, but they spent more than 800 yuan to customize gold needles.

	In order to give the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital a national style of decoration, they did not hesitate to spend money to buy palace lanterns. In order to beautify the environment, they specifically sent people to other places to spend more than 100 yuan to buy four pots of fir trees. In order to take care of the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, the hospital provided tea to everyone from doctors to janitors every day.

	Only caring about spending money lavishly, they were not very concerned about how much revenue came in. Anyway, if there was a loss, they would reach out to the higher authorities. Although one of the four vice presidents was responsible for this aspect, he did not really take responsibility. In addition to approving reimbursement receipts, he never raised the issue of saving and building the hospital diligently in meetings. The 40,000 yuan in medical expenses owed by patients was not collected for a long time. It was common to miss charging fees that were supposed to be collected. Last year, they checked the missed registration fees and found that 39 people were missed in one day, accounting for about 7%.

	No one was responsible for the safekeeping of property. Fixed assets were not registered. The aforementioned gold acupuncture needles were not accounted for, and no one cared about damaged or lost items. Useful things were not carefully kept. Things that they could not use themselves but other hospitals needed were also held onto. According to statistics, the hospital had more than ten kinds of valuable equipment in stock, such as microscopes, one-ten-thousandth balances, and electric refrigerators, worth nearly 20,000 yuan. For example, two shadowless lamps, which are used in the operating rooms of Western medicine hospitals, are worth more than 1,400 yuan and are not easy to buy. The hospital kept them in the warehouse for a long time and was unwilling to allocate them.

	Another important aspect of waste was increasing the burden of medical expenses on patients and the public. Prescriptions often prescribed many expensive medicines that could be used or not. Some doctors once prescribed 90 taels of American ginseng worth more than 4,000 yuan to a public-funded patient with neurasthenia. As for the public-funded medical care of the hospital's employees, the waste of taking medicine at will was even more serious due to the lack of strict management system. Employees could ask doctors for prescriptions for tonics at will, and some even prescribed prescriptions for themselves. Last year, not counting acupuncture, fluoroscopy, and other expenses, public-funded medical care exceeded the budget by more than 81%.

	What kind of bad consequences did these shocking phenomena of extravagance and waste bring to the hospital? Of course, the first bad consequence was that they not only could not accumulate a single penny for the country, but also wasted about 100,000 yuan in the past year. Last year, two-fifths of the hospital's expenditures were maintained by subsidies from higher authorities. Secondly, because there were too many people and everyone was used to being idle, labor discipline was very lax and lacked vigor. The laundry room originally had eight people and was responsible for washing used gauze in order to save gauze. Later, after installing a washing machine, the task was reduced by half. Although two people were reduced, they were still very idle, but they secretly burned the used gauze, and no one was willing to wash it.

	However, after rectification, the socialist consciousness of the entire hospital staff was raised, and they all came together to expose the phenomenon of waste, igniting the flames of anti-waste, which also aroused the attention of the leadership. The hospital leadership timely organized a special group to conduct inspections and fully mobilize the masses to discuss.

	Why did the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital have such serious waste? After accepting the criticism from the masses, the hospital's leadership comrades made a profound self-criticism. They believed that the growth of waste in the hospital was mainly the result of being influenced by bourgeois ideology, starting from the leadership.

	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is a new type of hospital in China. Because the Party and government leaders attach importance to it, it is easy to get money. In order to "create a brand" for the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, they took advantage of this loophole, engaged in many tricks to ask the higher authorities for money, and spent it lavishly. They blindly pursued the modernization of equipment and inappropriately emphasized decoration. Although they knew that some things could not be used after purchasing them, they were unwilling to allocate them to other hospitals because they were waiting for the hospital's great development. In their minds, there was no "thrift" in sight. They only cared about treatment and not about economics, and of course, they would not consider the country's expenses and the burden on the masses.

	Through exposure and inspection, the masses had a deep understanding of the Party's policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily, and they carefully calculated and tried every means to save state funds. Plans for each unit to use fewer people, spend less money, and do more things were put forward one after another and conscientiously implemented. The number of personnel in the hospital was greatly reduced. The administrative staff in the hospital office was reduced from the original 14 to 4. The number of medical staff has been reduced by 67, and some more are planned to be reduced. With fewer people, they can see more patients. The number of outpatients increased from 600 to 1,000, and no appointment is required, so that patients can see a doctor as soon as they arrive. The red building has been opened as a ward for the hemorrhoid and fistula department, and is now full of patients. After mass discussion and careful calculation, the hospital's 1958 budget can reduce expenditures by one-sixth compared to last year. In the past, two-fifths of the expenditures required state subsidies, but this year, no subsidies are needed. A new atmosphere has emerged in the whole hospital. The amount of expensive medicines prescribed by doctors has also been reduced by two-thirds compared to the past. The hemorrhoid and fistula department originally proposed to spend 60 yuan to buy new probes, but now they actively requested that 30 yuan would be enough. In the past, many people disliked the old white coats, but now they actively request not to change to new ones. The general affairs personnel proposed that the public miscellaneous expenses could be reduced by 32,000 yuan from last year's 90,000 yuan. For the registration receipts alone, imported typing paper was used in the past, costing 260 yuan per month, but now it has been changed to domestic products, costing only 120 yuan per month. The janitorial staff proposed that mops for mopping the floor could be made from waste cloth, which could save 50 to 60 yuan per month.

    烈火的洗礼
    ——记北京市中医医院的反浪费运动
    陈大任
    一个多月以前，在北京市中医医院的红楼里，红红绿绿的大字报张贴了楼上楼下的每一块墙壁。全院的人们怀着激动的心情，对医院的领导上提出了几千条批评的意见。来到这里的人，当他发觉这座楼原来是有着五十张病床的病房时，都不禁诧异地问：床位这样紧张，为什么这里却拿病房当做鸣放园地呢？
    问题就在这里。从这个问题开始，反浪费的火焰在这座楼里燃烧了起来。它烧掉了这个医院的形形色色的铺张浪费现象。
    “月儿弯弯照九洲，他院繁忙我院闲，他院护士忙工作，我院护士守空楼。”这张由护士贴出的大字报，首先揭发了中医医院的问题。空楼就是指的这座红楼，它经常空着没有收病人，却配备有全班人马，护士闲着没事，一上班只好打毛衣、看小说、聊大天，看守这座空楼。这个医院并不大。却配备有专职的电工、木工、管子工，甚至还有建筑设计的绘图员。统计工作本来一个人每天用两小时就可以做完，却有三个统计员。摊子摆得很大，可是并没有尽量设法满足病人的需要。痔漏科有几百个病人等着住院治疗，医院领导上长期没有研究增加该科病床和提高该科病床周转率。初诊病人需要预约三个月以后才能看上病，医院却长期实行半日门诊，另外半天，有时候组织学习，有时候就根本没有事，职工管它叫“自由活动”时间。
    设备上追求现代化，讲究排场，造成了对国家资金的严重浪费。用砂锅煤火煎药，本来既经济适用，也符合中医的习惯，却花了八百七十二元设计安装了蒸气煎锅，因为不适用，把它拆掉了又花四千七百多元定制四台电气煎药锅，既不适用，又要经常修理炉丝，还必需用进口货，每天要用电费十四元。如用煤火，每天有二元多就够了。针灸用的针，用银针已经最好不过了，他们却花了八百多元定制了金针。
    为了使中医医院有民族形式的装饰，不惜花钱买宫灯。为了美化环境，特地派人去外地花了一百多元买回了四盆枞树。为了照顾中医，从大夫到勤杂工每天都由医院供给茶叶。
    只顾大手大脚花钱，对收入多少是不大关心的，反正亏了就伸手向上级要。四个副院长中虽有一人分工管这方面的事，但是并没有真正负起责任来，除去做做批报销的账条以外，从未把节约和勤俭建院等问题提到会上进行讨论。病人欠下的四万元医疗费用也长期没有要。规定收的费而漏收的更是常事，去年他们检查了一次挂号费的漏费情况，发现一天就漏了三十九人，约占7％。
    财产的保管也是无人负责的。固定资产没有登记，上面说的针灸用金针就没有账，损坏或丢失了东西也无人过问。有用的东西不认真保管，自己用不上而别的医院又很需要的东西也都把着不放。据统计该院积压显微镜、万分之一的天平及电气冰箱等贵重器材共十多种，价值近二万元。如两台无影灯，是西医医院手术室用的，价值一千四百多元，不容易买到，该院把它长期的放在仓库，不愿拨出。
    浪费的另一个重要方面，是增加病人和公家对医疗费用的负担。处方经常开出许多可用可不用的贵重药，有的大夫曾给一位神经衰弱的公费病人先后开出九十两价值四千多元的西洋参。至于本院职工的公费医疗，由于缺乏严格的管理制度，随便吃药的浪费就更严重了。职工可以随意找大夫开处方要补药，甚至有的人还自己给自己开处方。去年不算针灸、透视等费用，公费医疗还超支达81％以上。
    这些触目惊心的铺张浪费现象，给医院带来了什么恶果呢？当然哪，首先一个恶果是他们不仅不能为国家积累一块钱，而且在去年一年浪费了约十万元。去年全院有五分之二的支出是靠上级的补助拨款来维持，其次，因为人浮于事，大家闲散惯了，劳动纪律非常松弛，没有朝气。洗衣房原来有八个人，为了节约纱布，还负责洗涤用过的纱布。后来安上洗衣机，任务减少了一半，虽然减去了两个人，还非常清闲，但是他们把用过的纱布偷偷地烧掉了，没人肯动手洗它。
    但是，在整改以后，全院工作人员社会主义觉悟提高了，一齐起来揭发浪费现象，燃起了反浪费的烈火，也引起了领导方面的重视，该院领导及时组织专门小组进行检查和充分发动群众讨论。
    中医医院倒底为什么会产生严重的浪费现象呢？院的领导同志在接受群众的批评以后，作了深刻的检讨。他们认为该院浪费现象的滋长，从领导起主要是受到资产阶级思想影响的结果。
    中医医院是我国的新型医院，由于党政领导上重视它，要钱方便。他们为了给中医医院“创牌子”，就钻这个空子，搞了很多名堂向上级要钱，大手大脚的花。盲目地追求设备现代化，不恰当地讲求装饰。他们对有些东西购置后虽然知道无法利用它，但为了要等着本院的大发展，也不愿拨给别的医院。在他们的思想上，“勤俭”连影子也没有，只管治疗，不管经济，当然也就不会考虑到国家的开支和群众的负担问题。
    通过揭发和检查以后，群众对党关于勤俭办医院的方针认识得深刻了，也就精打细算，千方百计地设法节约国家资金。各单位少用人、少花钱、多办事的方案也就一个接着一个地提出来并认真地执行。医院的人员大减了，院部办公室的行政干部由原来的十四人减为四人。医护人员已经减去六十七人，还准备再减一些。人少了，还能多看病人，门诊由六百人增加到一千人，而且不需预约，做到了随到随诊。红楼已经开辟为痔漏科病房，现在已经住满了病人。该院1958年预算经过群众讨论和精打细算的结果，可比去年少支出六分之一的经费。过去五分之二的开支需要国家补助，今年可以不用补助了。全院出现了新气象。大夫对贵重药品的开用量也比过去减少了三分之二。痔漏科原来提出要用六十元买新的探针，现在主动要求用三十元就可以了。过去有许多人嫌白衣破旧了，现在主动要求不要换新的。总务人员提出公杂费开支可以比去年的九万元减少三万二千元。单是挂号收据用纸，过去用的是进口打字纸，每月需二百六十元，现在改用国货，每月一百二十元就够了。勤杂人员提出擦地用的墩布可以利用废布自制，每月就可节约五、六十元。
