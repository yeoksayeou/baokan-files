The rectification movement has begun to bring new prosperity to the Shanghai drama scene. Judging from the performance plans currently being drawn up by various Shanghai theater troupes, this year will be an unprecedentedly active year for theatrical performances in Shanghai.

This year, Shanghai's theater troupes are universally implementing the literary and artistic policy of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers," making performances in factories and rural areas, as well as guiding mass cultural activities, the main work of the troupes. Many troupes plan to perform more shows in factories and rural areas this year than ever before. The Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe decided to divide the entire troupe into two teams: one team will perform in theaters in the city, and the other team will tour the three suburban districts of Shanghai for the entire year, performing 360 shows. The troupe's main actors, Ding Shi'e, Shi Xiaoying, Shao Binsun, and others will all take turns performing in the countryside for four months. The Shanghai People's Huai Opera Troupe, which went to northern Jiangsu last year to perform for peasants for more than three months and won enthusiastic praise from the peasants, will perform 200 shows for Shanghai workers this year, and will also tour industrial and mining areas in the second half of the year. The Shanghai Yue Opera Theater, the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, the Shanghai People's Pingtan Troupe, the Shanghai Experimental Opera House, the Shanghai Chorus, and other troupes have also decided to spend more time performing for workers and peasants.

When the actors of Shanghai's theater troupes go to factories and the countryside, they not only perform for workers and peasants, but also participate in labor together with them. After performing at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, the actors of the Shanghai People's Art Theater worked with the workers to transport materials, clean the furnace platform, remove coal slag, and sort iron ore. The result of participating in labor also enabled the actors to gain a lot of production knowledge. When the actors of the Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe were picking cotton with the members of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative, they learned from the members the method of picking cotton and realized that the gestures they used to sing "Picking Cotton" on stage in the past were wrong and were being performed as if they were picking tea. This year's Spring Festival will be the climax of the Shanghai theater troupes' performances in factories and the countryside. They proposed to ensure that "every township has plays to watch and every commune has activities" in the rural suburbs during the Spring Festival.

While carrying out large-scale performance activities this year, Shanghai's drama circles will continue to sort out traditional plays, create new plays, expand and enrich the repertoire, and promote the development of Shanghai's drama industry.

    整风运动带来戏剧界新的繁荣
    上海各剧团下厂下乡经常化
    本报上海24日电　整风运动已开始给上海戏剧界带来了新的繁荣，从目前上海各剧团拟订的演出计划来看，今年将是上海戏剧界演出活动空前活跃的一年。
    今年上海各剧团普遍贯彻“为工农兵服务”的文艺方针，把下厂、下乡演出和辅导群众文艺列为团的主要工作，不少剧团今年计划在工厂、农村演出的场数都是前所未有的。上海市人民沪剧团决定把全团分为两个队，一队在市内剧场演出，一队将整年在上海三个郊区巡回演出三百六十场，团内的主要演员丁是娥、石筱英、邵滨孙等都将轮流下乡演出四个月。去年去苏北为农民演出三个多月，博得农民热烈好评的上海市人民淮剧团，今年要为上海工人演出二百场，下半年还将到工矿地区巡回演出。上海越剧院、上海京剧院、上海市人民评弹团、上海实验歌剧院、上海合唱团等剧团也决定用较多的时间去为工人和农民演出。
    上海各剧团的演员在下厂、下乡时，一面为工人和农民演出，一面还和工人、农民共同进行劳动。上海人民艺术剧院的演员在上海钢铁三厂演出后同工人一起运料、打扫炉台，出煤渣、分铁矿等工作。参加劳动的结果也使演员们获得了不少的生产知识，上海人民沪剧团演员在东方红农业社和社员们一起摘棉花时，经社员们讲解摘棉花的方法，才发现过去她们在舞台上演唱“拾棉花”的手势是错了，被演成像是采茶。今年春节将是上海各剧团下厂、下乡演出的高潮，他们提出要做到郊区农村在春节中“乡乡有戏看，社社有活动”。
    今年上海戏剧界在大规模开展演出活动的同时，还将继续整理传统剧目，创作新剧目，扩大和丰富上演剧目，繁荣上海的戏剧事业。
