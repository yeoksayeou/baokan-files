    Shantou Prefecture Achieves High Yields on Two Thousand Mu of Land
    Grain Yield of Three Thousand Jin Per Mu
    Guangdong is Advancing Towards the Goal of a "Thousand Jin Province"
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, January 1st dispatch) On the joyous New Year's Day of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Southern Daily here published the following good news in a headline position: In 1957, Shantou Prefecture had approximately two thousand mu of land that achieved a grain yield of three thousand jin per mu. The number of "Thousand Jin Townships" and "Thousand Jin Cooperatives" increased by about one-third compared to 1956. The entire prefecture had one hundred and ten "Thousand Jin Townships" (large townships), accounting for about one-third of the total number of townships. There were two thousand three hundred and fifty-six "Thousand Jin Cooperatives", accounting for 39% of the total number of cooperatives.

    The main reasons for the high grain yields in Shantou Prefecture are that the local leading organs actively led agricultural cooperatives to universally build farmland water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, and carry out technological reforms. Promoting crop rotation and increasing the multiple cropping index were important factors in achieving high yields. For example, the high-yield fields in Chenghai County were all "three crops a year." Qingfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Tuopu Township of this county had 1.8 mu of high-yield land, with a yield of 3,129 jin per mu. Simply by changing the late rice crop to sweet potatoes, the yield reached as high as 9,100 jin per mu, equivalent to 2,275 jin of rice. The Xiyang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanxi Township had four mu of land. In the spring of 1957, each mu yielded 1,400 jin of sweet potatoes. The early rice yielded 573 jin per mu. Changing the late rice crop to sweet potatoes resulted in a yield of 9,000 jin per mu, averaging a total annual harvest equivalent to 3,173 jin of rice per mu.

    The Southern Daily also published an editorial entitled "Leap Forward Towards the Great Goal of a Thousand Jin Province," pointing out that the province had already reached an average yield of 510 jin per mu in 1957. In the next ten years, as long as there is an increase of 76%, that is, an average annual increase of 7.6%, with an annual increase of just over 5.8%, the target of 900 jin can be reached in 1967. Accelerating slightly more will achieve the great goal of a "Thousand Jin Province." The editorial called on the people of the entire province to meet this day with a fighting spirit.

### 汕头专区两千亩田高额丰产  亩产粮食三千斤  广东正在向“千斤省”的目标前进

    汕头专区两千亩田高额丰产
    亩产粮食三千斤
    广东正在向“千斤省”的目标前进
    本报广州1日电　在第二个五年计划的第一个喜气洋洋的元旦日，这里的南方日报以头条位置刊登了这样的喜讯：汕头专区1957年有约两千亩田达到亩产粮食三千斤，千斤乡和千斤社的数目比1956年增加了三分之一左右，全专区有千斤乡（大乡）一百一十个，约占乡的总数三分之一，千斤社有二千三百五十六个，占社的总数的39％。
    汕头专区获得粮食高额丰产的主要原因，除当地领导机关积极领导农业社普遍兴修农田水利、积肥和开展技术改革外，推行轮种和增加复种指数，是获得高产的一个重要因素。例如澄海县的高额丰产田都是“一年三熟”。这个县鮀浦乡青锋农业社有一亩八分丰产田，亩产三千一百二十九斤，其中仅把晚稻改种甘薯，亩产就高达九千一百斤，折合稻谷二千二百七十五斤。南溪乡西洋农业社有四亩田，1957年春每亩收甘薯一千四百斤，早稻亩产五百七十三斤，晚稻改种甘薯亩产九千斤，平均每亩全年收获折合稻谷三千一百七十三斤。
    南方日报还发表了以“向千斤省的伟大目标跃进”为题的社论，指出全省在1957年已达到平均亩产五百一十斤，在今后十年中，只要增长76％，即平均每年增长7.6％，每年递增仅5.8％强，就可在1967年达到九百斤的指标，稍微再加快一点，就可实现千斤省的伟大目标。社论号召全省人民要以战斗的姿态来迎接这一个日子。
