    Leap in Production, Years of Abundance
    ——On the Achievements of Schistosomiasis Control in Jianshan Township, Zhide County, Anhui Province
                Zhou Yifan, Yang Youcai
        A Miserable Past
    Jianshan Township in Zhide County, southern Anhui Province, is surrounded by lakes on three sides, with crisscrossing rivers and canals, interwoven lakes and marshes, abundant water plants, and fertile land. However, in the old society, due to the prevalence of schistosomiasis, fields were barren, the population was sparse, and the economy was bankrupt. Coupled with the exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the reactionary government and landlords, the peasants suffered from poverty and disease. This township had seventy-one natural villages, more than a thousand households, and more than two thousand three hundred people in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Due to the continuous rise in mortality, the population gradually declined. By the eve of liberation, the township had only thirty-one natural villages, three hundred and twenty-eight households, and one thousand one hundred and twenty-four people. The vast majority of people were deprived of their lives by schistosomiasis, resulting in deaths and family extinctions. Jiangyao and Oyao villages, fifty years ago, were prosperous villages with hundreds of households and more than four hundred people. By the time of liberation, only twenty-one households and twenty-two people remained, including fifteen households of widows and widowers. Therefore, people called it "Widow Village." At that time, a tragic ballad circulated among the masses:
    "Jiangyao Village,
    Oyao Village,
    Fields are barren, houses collapse,
    People die, families are wiped out, all is desolate."
    Today, the people of Jianshan Township still have vivid memories of the past suffering caused by schistosomiasis.
        On the Prevention and Control Front
    After the liberation of Jianshan Township in 1949, the Communist Party and the People's Government took a series of measures to prevent and control schistosomiasis, and have continuously achieved significant results. In 1955, in order to completely eliminate this disease, the Zhide County Committee of the Communist Party of China focused on this township for prevention and control, established a prevention and control team, and sent medical personnel and work teams to be stationed in the township for a long time to mobilize the masses and carry out comprehensive prevention and control work. In the prevention and control work, the township not only eliminated a large number of snails, but also managed feces and water sources. Now, the thirty-one natural villages in the township have forty-one collective toilets, sixty-eight field toilets, and thirty manure storage cellars. The feces of more than four hundred households are centrally stored, managed and used in a unified manner. The township has newly built and renovated thirty-four collective cattle pens, most of the pig pens are centralized, and thirty-one people have been organized into seven wild manure collection teams to be responsible for collecting wild manure in designated areas. Manure from livestock is treated by composting and high-temperature composting to kill schistosomiasis eggs. Now, it has basically achieved "clean roads, clean houses, no wild manure, and manure is applied to the fields only after the eggs are killed." "Drinking water is not used for other purposes, and water is not used for drinking" and "using water from different ponds separately" have become the daily habits of the people of Jianshan Township. Ponds, wells, ditches and canals near each village are marked to distinguish between drinking water pools (wells), vegetable washing pools, laundry pools, manure washing pools, and cattle bathing pools. The township has newly built and renovated fifty-eight earth and stone wells, newly opened one hundred and sixty-one various water use pools, and built sand filter dams in ditches and streams, adopting the method of "upstream for drinking water, downstream for water use" to segment the use of water. In recent years, the township has mobilized more than 31,000 people to carry out a month-long snail eradication campaign and six week-long campaigns, combining water conservancy construction to clean up 150 large and small ditches two to three times. The snails dug up were buried or burned, and now snails near villages have basically disappeared. In the lake and marsh areas of more than 160 million square meters, more than 80% of snails have been burned. In terms of personal protection, 70% of farmers in the township now wear leggings and waterproof cloth socks to work in paddy fields. Farmers in the township all understand the basic knowledge of prevention and control.
        A Series of Changes
    Due to the continuous victories in the fight against schistosomiasis in Jianshan Township, the health of the people has been continuously improved, which has powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production, making today's Jianshan Township a prosperous scene of leap in production and years of abundance. According to the examination of one thousand and sixty people in the spring of 1956, seven hundred and seventy-four people were infected with schistosomiasis, accounting for 73% of the total population. After the prevention and control team and Chinese medicine treated 638 patients, there are now only more than 130 patients with schistosomiasis in the township. The mortality rate has decreased year by year. In 1954, 68 people died in the township, 9 people died in 1956, and 5 people died in 1957. Now there are 417 households and 1,477 people in the township, an increase of dozens of households and 353 people compared with 1948 before liberation. Most of the original schistosomiasis patients have recovered their health after treatment and happily participated in production. According to preliminary investigations, the physical strength of 328 people has been significantly improved and they can engage in field manual labor. Chen Yubang, a member of the Houlong Cooperative, used to have to stop and rest while walking. He only worked twenty-seven labor days the year before last. After treatment, he worked 134 labor days in the first ten months of last year. This family used to rely entirely on government relief, but now they no longer need it. There are a total of sixty-seven households in the township in this situation.
    In the past, due to the lack of labor in this township, a large number of outside workers had to be hired during the busy farming season. In 1956, the five cooperatives in the township spent more than 1,900 yuan in wages. Since more than 500 patients have been cured, not only have no temporary workers been hired, but also production has been very good and output has greatly increased. In 1954, the average annual grain output per mu was 362 jin, which increased to 507 jin in 1956, and further increased to 565 jin in 1957. The township increased grain production by more than 170,000 jin in 1957 compared with 1956. Now, the farmers in the township are fully confident to make a greater leap forward on the basis of the current output and strive to achieve 800 jin of grain per mu in 1959.
    In the past, twenty-eight young people in this township were tortured by diseases and were dying and underdeveloped. Now they have become strong men, regained their youth, and some are even preparing to get married. In the past, many women were deprived of their youth by schistosomiasis. Nine women had not given birth for many years after marriage, but now some are pregnant and some have already given birth. Hua Yueying had not given birth to a child for twenty years after marriage. She was cured of her illness the year before last and now has a fat baby. Jiangyao Village, which was always known as "Widow Village," also added three children in two years. Many patients with advanced schistosomiasis have been revived from the brink of death. Chen Zhongyi of Houlong Cooperative was tortured by the disease and was about to die. His family had already prepared a coffin. After Chinese medicine doctors sent medicine to his door for treatment, he has now been cured.
    Now, the people of Jianshan Township are sincerely grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for today's happy life. Another folk song is circulating among the broad masses: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao launched the schistosomiasis prevention campaign, increasing production and eliminating diseases, making a great leap in production, the scenery is getting better every day, every household has changed, and the Widow Village has become a prosperous village."
  Strive to Thoroughly Defeat Schistosomiasis
    Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of Jianshan Township have gained a new life. They have set up a banner on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front in Anhui Province and have been awarded the honorary title of model township.
    Now the people of Jianshan Township are full of confidence and strive to achieve the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) on eliminating the most serious diseases that harm people ahead of schedule. They strive to have basically no schistosomiasis patients in the township by 1958. At present, the broad masses are combining water conservancy construction and agricultural production to vigorously eliminate snails by clearing ditches and burying soil, scraping turf, burning, spraying with chemicals, converting water fields into dry land, and supplementing with manual capture. They are determined to basically eliminate snails within half a li around larger natural villages before this spring and to achieve a snail-free cooperative. (Attached picture)

    生产跃进　人寿年丰
    ——记安徽至德县建东乡血吸虫病防治工作的成就
                周一凡、杨有才
        凄惨的往昔
    皖南山区至德县的建东乡，三面临湖，境内河渠纵横，湖沼交错，水草丰盛，土地肥沃。但是在旧社会里，由于流行着血吸虫病，田园荒芜，人烟稀少，经济破产，再加上反动政府和地主恶霸的苛捐杂税，农民贫病交迫。这个乡在明末清初拥有七十一个自然村，一千多户，二千三百多人，由于死亡率的不断上升，人口在逐渐下降。到解放前夕，该乡只剩下三十一个自然村，三百二十八户，一千一百二十四人，绝大部分人被血吸虫病夺去了生命，以致死亡绝户。江窑欧窑两村，五十年前是一个上百户拥有四百多人的兴旺村庄，到解放时只剩下二十一户二十二口人，其中并有十五户孤寡。因此。人们叫它“寡妇村”。当时群众中曾经流传着一首悲惨的歌谣：
    “江窑村、
    欧窑村、
    田园荒芜房屋倒，
    人亡户绝冷清清。”
    如今建东乡人民对于过去血吸虫病为害的伤心往事，记忆犹新。
        在防治线上
    1949年建东乡解放以后，共产党和人民政府采取了一系列的措施防治血吸虫病，不断获得了明显的成绩。1955年为了彻底消灭这一病害，中共至德县委会以这乡为防治重点，设立了防治组，派了医药人员和工作组长期驻在乡里，发动群众，进行综合性的防治工作。在防治工作中，该乡不仅大量消灭了钉螺，而且对粪便和水源加以管理。现在该乡三十一个自然村有集体厕所四十一个，田间厕所六十八个，贮粪窖三十个，四百多户的粪便集中贮存、统一管理使用。全乡新建、改建的集体牛栏三十四座，猪圈大都集中，并组织了三十一人成立七个拾野粪小组，划片包干，专门拣拾野粪。对于牲畜粪采用沤腐和高温堆肥法，来消灭血吸虫卵。现在基本上作到了“道清宅净无野粪，粪便灭卵才下田”。“吃水不用、用水不吃”和“分塘用水”，已经成为建东乡人民的日常生活习惯。每个村庄附近的塘、井、沟渠都插上了标志，分清了吃水池（井）、洗菜池、洗衣池、洗刷粪具池和牛浴池。全乡新建和修建土、石井五十八眼，新辟各项用水池一百六十一处，又在沟渠小溪里打了沙滤坝，采取了“上流为吃水、下流为用水”的分段用水方法。几年来，全乡共发动三万一千多人次，开展了一个灭螺突击月和六个突击周活动，结合兴修水利将一百五十条大、小沟渠清理了二至三次，清出来的螺采用土埋或火烧，现在村庄附近钉螺已基本上绝迹。在一亿六千多平方公尺的湖沼地区，火烧钉螺80％以上。在个人防护上，现在全乡有70％的农民打绑腿，穿油布袜子下水田生产。该乡农民已人人懂得防治的基本知识。
        一连串的变化
    建东乡由于在向血吸虫病害斗争中不断地取得了胜利，人民的健康状况也在不断地改进，有力地推动了农业生产的发展，使今天的建东乡到处出现了生产跃进、人寿年丰的兴隆景象。据1956年春检查的一千零六十人中，即有七百七十四人感染了血吸虫病，占总人口73％。经过防治组和中医治疗好六百三十八名病人后，现在全乡血吸虫病患者只有一百三十余人，死亡率逐年减少，1954年全乡死亡六十八人，1956年死亡九人，1957年全乡死亡五人，现在全乡有四百十七户，一千四百七十七人，比解放前的1948年增加了几十户，三百五十三人。原来的吸血虫病患者，经过治疗后，大部分人都恢复了健康，愉快地参加了生产。据初步调查，现在有三百二十八人的体力显著提高，能从事田间体力劳动。后垅社社员陈玉榜以前走路都要走走歇歇，前年一年只做了二十七个劳动日，治疗后，去年头十个月中就做了一百三十四个劳动日。这一家往年全靠政府救济，今年再也不要救济了。像这样情况的全乡共有六十七户。
    以前，这个乡由于劳力缺乏，每当农忙季节要雇请大批外来帮工。1956年全乡五个社花去一千九百多元的工资。自从治好五百多名病人以后，不但没有雇请临时工，而且生产搞的很好，产量大大提高，1954年粮食平均每亩年产三百六十二斤，1956年增加到五百零七斤，1957年又增加到五百六十五斤，全乡1957年比1956年增产粮食十七万多斤。现在，该乡农民完全有信心在现在产量的基础上来个更大的跃进，争取在1959年每亩产粮食达到八百斤。
    原来这个乡里有二十八个青年人被病害折磨的奄奄一息，发育不正常，现在变成了健壮大汉，恢复了青春，有的还准备结婚。原来许多妇女被血吸虫病夺去了青春，曾经有九个妇女婚后多年不生育，现在有的怀了孕，有的已生了孩子。妇女华月英结婚二十年没有生过一胎，前年治好了病，现在生了一个白胖胖的孩子。一向被人们称为“寡妇村”的江窑村，两年也添了三个孩子。许多晚期血吸虫病患者，从死亡边缘上得到了复生，后垅社的陈中贻被病害折磨的快要死了，家里人老早就准备了棺材，经过中医送药上门诊治后，现已治愈。
    现在，建东乡人民面对着今天的幸福生活，都衷心地感谢共产党和毛主席。在广大群众中又在流行着这样一个歌谣：“共产党和毛主席，发动搞血防，增产又除病，生产大跃进，光景日日新，家家户户变了样，寡妇村变兴隆村”。
  为彻底战胜血吸虫病而奋斗
    建东乡人民在党和政府的领导下，获得了新生。他们在安徽省的血吸虫病防治战线上树立了旗帜，获得了模范乡的光荣称号。
    现在建东乡人民满怀信心，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中关于消灭危害人们最严重疾病的要求，他们争取在1958年内全乡基本上没有血吸虫病人。目前广大群众正在结合着兴修水利、农业生产，采用清沟土埋、铲草皮、火烧、药剂喷杀、水改旱田和辅以人工捕捉等办法，大力歼灭钉螺。他们有决心在今年春季以前，做到在较大自然村周围半华里以内基本上消灭了钉螺，并且实现一个无螺社。（附图片）
