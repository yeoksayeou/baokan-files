    How Big is the Waste at Nanjing Normal College?
    The wasted money could buy enough rice to feed 2,400 students for a year
    (Our dispatch) Nanjing Normal College, after entering the rectification phase, has seen thousands of big-character posters sharply criticizing the phenomenon of waste. Various departments have successively held small "anti-waste" exhibitions. The college held a college-wide "anti-waste, anti-backlog, anti-destruction of public property" exhibition on the 2nd of this month.
    The exhibits are displayed in three rooms. The first thing that catches the audience's eye is a telephone switchboard, which was "snatched" from the market last year for more than 500 yuan. The machine itself has many problems, and no one can operate it. Two accordions, worth 1,560 yuan, are not used and are left to rust. A telephoto camera and two micro-projectors, worth more than 3,700 yuan, are lying silently in the room. Fourteen parallel bars, six uneven bars, and twenty mats (worth more than 2,500 yuan in total) are still sleeping in the storage room. The waste of water and electricity is astonishing. The overspending in November last year alone was 318 yuan, which amounts to 3,816 yuan for the whole year. A valuable slicer is holding up more than 4,000 yuan in funds.
    Damaged public property is displayed in the third room. One "driver" violated the rules and crashed into a basketball hoop, seriously injuring a brand-new motorcycle, causing a loss of more than 1,000 yuan. The Chemistry Department has broken more than 400 kilograms of glass instruments in the past two years, worth 2,080 yuan. The Geography Department damaged tape measures, compasses, and range poles worth 601 yuan in one year. The Music Department damaged four accordions and seventeen erhus. These are just a small part of the problem.
    At the exit of the exhibition, there is a conspicuous statistical table titled "Let's Do the Math": Damaged and backlogged materials – 6,700 items, equivalent to RMB – 100,000 yuan. The value of this money – 1. Equivalent to the annual living expenses of 1,667 farmers. 2. Can buy 5,739 dan of rice, just enough for all 2,400 students in the college to eat for a year. 3. Can buy 25,000 zhang of ordinary blue cloth, enough to make 17,857 sets of men's uniforms. 4. Equivalent to the annual salary of eighty-three lecturers.

    南京师范学院浪费有多大？
    浪费的钱买米可够二千四百学生吃一年
    本报讯　南京师范学院进入整改后，成千张大字报尖锐地批评浪费现象，各系科先后举办小型“反浪费”展览会。该学院于本月2日举办全院性的“反浪费反积压反破坏公物”展览会。
    展览品分陈三室。第一个落进观众眼内的是一架电话总机，这是去年花五百多元在市场上“抢购”来的，机器本身毛病多端，又无人能够操纵。两架手风琴，价值一千五百六十元，无人使用，只得让它生锈了。价值三千七百多元的望远照像机和两架显微放映机，无声无息地躺在屋里。十四付双杠、六付高低杠、二十个垫子（共值二千五百多元）至今还睡在储藏室中。水电的浪费使人吃惊，光去年11月份就超支三百一十八元，以全年计就得三千八百一十六元。一架珍贵的切片机就积压资金四千多元。
    被损坏的公物都陈列在第三室中。有位“驾驶员”，不遵守规则，撞坏了篮球架，使崭新的摩托车身受重伤，损失一千多元。化学系两年来打破的玻璃仪器共有四百多斤，价值二千零八十元。地理系一年中损坏了皮尺、罗盘、花标杆等共值六百零一元。音乐系损坏了四架手风琴、十七把二胡。这些仅不过一小部分而已。
    展览会出口处，有一张显目的统计表，题目为“算笔账”：损坏和积压物资——六千七百件，折合人民币——十万元。这笔钱的价值——一、相当于一千六百六十七个农民的全年生活费用。二、可买五千七百三十九担大米，刚好够全院二千四百个学生吃一年。三、可买二万五千丈普通蓝，男制服可制一万七千八百五十七套。四、等于八十三个讲师全年的工薪。
