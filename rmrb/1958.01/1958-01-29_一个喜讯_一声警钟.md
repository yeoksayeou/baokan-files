Agricultural cooperatives are divided into advanced and backward categories, which is an objective reality. However, advanced and backward are not immutable. Under certain conditions, the advanced can become backward, and the backward can surpass the advanced. This is because advanced things contain the possibility of becoming backward, while backward things also contain positive factors. In the continuous development of things, the backward, if they strive to catch up, can transform from backward to advanced. The advanced, if complacent and cease to move forward, will shift to a backward position. This news about the comparison of winter production between Category Three and Category One cooperatives in Jiangpu County uses vivid facts to illustrate this objective law of the development of things to us once again.

Relatively high awareness among members, a relatively good style of work among cadres, and a relatively solid foundation for production are common characteristics of advanced Category One cooperatives. These characteristics constitute the most favorable factors for today's great leap in production. However, a small number of Category One cooperatives in Jiangpu County did not continue to develop these positive factors in winter production, and did not become even more advanced. There are various reasons for this, but the most important is that after temporarily reaching an advanced level, they became complacent, and some even ignored the instructions of the county Party committee. As a result, positive factors turned into negative factors. For example, in the socialist education movement, they believed that the members' awareness was high and that poor and lower-middle peasants held the leadership advantage, so they did not pay attention to organizing the members to speak out freely and extensively, and did not pay attention to relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to distinguish right from wrong. The cadres believed that their work style was generally good, so they no longer listened humbly to the opinions of the members with the attitude of "drawing fire to oneself" and thoroughly improved their work style. Because of this, the relatively favorable conditions in Category One cooperatives gave way to unfavorable factors, and production fell behind. This news from Jiangpu County is worthy of a rude awakening for comrades in Category One cooperatives.

The reasons for the backwardness of Category Three cooperatives are generally the low awareness of the members, the sabotage of hostile class elements and bad elements, poor production, and the impure composition and work style of the cadres. These problems are indeed unfavorable to the great leap in production. However, it should also be seen that difficulties contain factors for overcoming difficulties. For example, the poor production of Category Three cooperatives and the many opinions of the members are bad things. However, poor production itself has aroused the strong desire of the broad masses of members, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, to improve production, and this strong desire is precisely the driving force to change the backwardness of production and promote the great leap in production. Therefore, what plays a decisive role here is the question of what attitude to take towards Category Three cooperatives. The cadres of Tongxin Cooperative in Baima Township faced up to the negative factors in the cooperative and conscientiously improved the shortcomings in their own thinking and work style. At the same time, they relied on the initiative of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and conducted extensive debates with leadership, distinguishing between major rights and wrongs, and everyone's enthusiasm was generally improved. It can be seen that as long as more Marxism-Leninism is sent to Category Three cooperatives, and every effort is made to promote the positive factors and overcome the negative factors in the cooperatives, then they are entirely possible to transform from a backward state to an advanced state in the current production upsurge, and even rapidly improve to an advanced level. The comrades of Category Three cooperatives should have such lofty ambitions and determination. In today's era of great social change, the struggle between the advanced and the backward is very significant. If advanced cooperatives lie there and sleep, it is easy to fall from an advanced position to a backward position in an instant. The objective facts are just like this. Those Category One and Two cooperatives in Jiangpu County that have fallen behind, if they are unwilling to admit defeat, should catch up and recover their honor and continue to be advanced.

    一个喜讯  一声警钟
    农业社有先进和落后之分，这是一个客观存在。但是，先进与落后并不是不会变化的，在一定条件下，先进的会变成落后，落后的也会超过先进。因为，先进的事物中间包含着落后的可能，而落后的事物中间也包含着积极因素；在事物的不断发展中，落后的如果努力赶上去，就可以变落后为先进；先进的如果因自满而不继续前进，就会转变到落后的地位。江浦县三类社和一类社冬季生产情况对比的这则新闻，就是用活生生的事实，给我们又一次地说明了这个事物发展的客观规律。
    社员觉悟比较地高、干部作风比较地好、生产比较有基础，这是一类社所以先进的共同特点。这些特点，构成了今天生产大跃进的最有利的因素。但是，江浦县少数一类社在冬季生产中，却没有继续发扬这些积极因素，做到先进更加先进。这里的原因是多种多样的，而最主要的就是因为他们在暂时达到了先进水平之后，开始自满起来，个别的甚至连县委的指示也不理不睬了。结果，积极因素变成了消极因素。如在社会主义教育运动中，他们认为社员觉悟高，贫农下中农占领导优势，就不去注意组织社员大鸣大放，不注意依靠贫农下中农辩清是非；干部们认为自己作风一般较好，也就不再以引火烧身的态度，虚心地听取社员的意见，彻底地改进自己的作风。正因为这样，一类社里的比较有利的条件让位于不利的因素，生产就落后了。江浦县这则新闻，值得一类社的同志们猛醒。
    三类社之所以落后，大体是社员觉悟不高，敌对阶级分子和坏分子捣乱、生产搞得不好、干部的成分不纯和作风不纯这几方面的问题。这些问题对生产大跃进来说，确实是不利的。但是，也应该看到，在困难中就包含着克服困难的因素。举个例说，三类社生产搞得不好，社员意见很多，这是一件不好的事。可是生产搞得不好的本身，便引起了广大社员、特别是广大贫农与下中农搞好生产的强烈愿望，而这种强烈的愿望正是改变生产落后面貌、促使生产大跃进的动力。因此，在这里起决定作用的，是对待三类社究竟采取什么态度的问题。白马乡同心社干部正视了社内的消极因素，认真地改进了自己思想作风上的毛病；同时，又依靠了广大贫农和下中农的积极性，有领导地开展了大辩论，分清了大是大非，大家的干劲也就普遍提高了。由此可见，只要多给三类社送一些马列主义思想去，千方百计地发扬社内的积极因素，克服社内的消极因素，那末他们就完全可能在当前的生产高潮中，由落后的状态向先进的状态转化，甚至迅速地提高到先进的水平，三类社的同志们应当有这样的壮志与决心。在社会大变动的今天，先进与落后的斗争是很显著的。先进的社如果躺在那里睡觉，转瞬之间很容易由先进地位降到落后地位，客观事实就是如此。江浦县那些掉下队来的一、二类社，如果不愿意认输的话，就应该奋起直追，恢复荣誉，继续做先进者。（原载新华日报）
