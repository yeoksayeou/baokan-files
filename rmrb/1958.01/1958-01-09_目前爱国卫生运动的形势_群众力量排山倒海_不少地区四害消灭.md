Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The person in charge of the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee recently gave an interview to a reporter from this agency, outlining the current situation of the Patriotic Health Campaign. He said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the broad masses have closely integrated the Patriotic Health Campaign with production and life, making it an indispensable part of their production and life, and thus it has become their conscious movement. It is precisely this conscious action of the masses, coupled with the strong leadership of the Party, that has created a magnificent new upsurge in the movement.

The Characteristics of the Upsurge

The person in charge said that the Patriotic Health Campaign has developed into a new upsurge centered on eliminating the four pests, and its breadth and depth exceed those of previous years. The movement is now gradually becoming popular in every corner of vast areas of the country. When the movement began in 1952, the main content of the movement was to oppose the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, and it was not deeply and specifically integrated with production and daily life. Now, paying attention to hygiene and eliminating the four pests has begun to become part of the daily life of many people; the masses' understanding of the movement has improved compared with the past, their experience is much richer, and the organizations at all levels leading the movement are also more sound. This is the characteristic of this upsurge of the movement.

Resounding Slogans, Great Achievements

Now, many provinces have put forward resounding slogans: one "four-free" township per county, one "four-free" cooperative per township, and one "four-free" street per city. Every township, every street, and every household across the country has been mobilized. Jiangsu Province already has 3,866 "four-free" villages, towns, and residential areas. In Shanxi Province, Jishan and Tunliu counties alone have captured and killed 643,000 rats and sparrows in this concentrated campaign, and the number of "four-free" villages has increased from 72 in the past to 104. Hebei Province's Zhangbei, Shangyi, Kangbao, Shangdu, Guyuan, and other five counties near Inner Mongolia have basically eliminated house rats and field rats. Through methods such as eliminating mosquitoes and mosquito larvae, preventing mosquito bites, and treating malaria, Hunan Province saw a 43% reduction in malaria patients in 1957 compared to 1956. Now, they are confidently proposing to further reduce the number of malaria patients by half within 1958. Hunan Province is a paddy field area with mountains, a good breeding ground for mosquitoes. The person in charge believes that if Hunan can achieve such results in eliminating mosquitoes and preventing malaria, it will not be difficult for other provinces to achieve similar results. Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, is an area where schistosomiasis is prevalent. For many years, the 6,000 boat people along the docks used to dump their feces into the river, which was a habit, creating a factor in the spread of schistosomiasis. From 1955 to the present, boat people have implemented fecal management, setting up manure cellars on the shore, controlling the spread of schistosomiasis, and at the same time, they can accumulate 800,000 dan of fertilizer every year. In Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, the masses were mobilized to bury snails (the vector of schistosomiasis), achieving three goals at once: schistosomiasis was basically eliminated; ditches were cleared and weeds removed, and the ditch mud and turf accumulated fertilizer; old ditches were filled and new ditches were dug, and irrigation was carried out in a planned way, turning many dry fields into paddy fields and increasing grain production. Pan Shifa, a farmer in Yujiang County, had suffered from schistosomiasis for more than ten years, and was unable to work and produce for a long time, and had to take medicine, so his life was very difficult. In recent years, due to the good hygiene and control of schistosomiasis transmission, and the state cured his illness, he has now become an agricultural labor model. In Tianjin, the vegetable, food, grocery, and other industries have also closely integrated hygiene work with production. For example, the soy sauce sales department not only does a good job of general cleaning, but also improved the management and operation methods used historically, so that maggots do not grow in soy sauce jars and soy sauce. Wulao Village in the suburbs of Nanjing, Jinhua Street in Guangzhou, Yuyu Village in the Great Miao Mountains of Guangxi Province, Jiujiang City in Jiangxi Province, Xingbazhan Village in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, Fushun Open-pit Mine, Tianjin Customs, and other regions and units have consistently adhered to the habit of cleanliness and hygiene since the movement began in 1952. The first three regions were national hygiene models in 1952, and their sanitary conditions have always met this glorious title in the past five years.

The Need to Eliminate Ideological Obstacles

After introducing these great achievements to the reporter, the person in charge went on to say that there are still some regions and units where hygiene work has not been done well. Upon inspection, the main reason is that some of the masses, especially a few leading cadres, have ideological obstacles. One obstacle is insufficient understanding of the great significance of paying attention to hygiene and eliminating the four pests, thinking that carrying out the health campaign hinders production; another obstacle is a lack of confidence in paying attention to hygiene and eliminating the four pests, so the leadership is weak and the masses have not been mobilized. The person in charge said that some people think that there is no theoretical basis for eliminating the four pests, and there are many doubts about whether the four pests can be basically eliminated. The person in charge emphatically pointed out: Our movement involves every household, everyone, it is universal and large-scale, the four pests are eliminated here, and they are also being eliminated there at the same time, they are being eliminated everywhere, and they must be eliminated everywhere; there are concentrated upsurges, and there is also regular work. Although the remaining four pests can reproduce, they will be constantly annihilated in the regular hygiene work, and they will inevitably become less and less, and finally achieve the goal of basic elimination. The many achievements listed above are enough to destroy this conservative thinking. The person in charge said that theory is summarized from practice, and the result of our practice is: the four pests have been eliminated in many areas, the habits of not paying attention to hygiene for thousands of years have been changed, cleanliness and hygiene work has been adhered to, fields have increased production, people have increased longevity, and the Patriotic Health Campaign is not only of great benefit to preventing and controlling human diseases and ensuring the health of livestock, but also accumulates fertilizer, improves water conservancy, and increases crop yields. This is the theory of carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign and eliminating the four pests.

The Masses Have Overwhelming Power

The person in charge further pointed out that the reason why this upsurge of the movement can quickly reach such a wide and in-depth level is due to the completion of the agricultural and handicraft industries' cooperativization. The superiority of being organized is not only reflected in production, but also in hygiene work and various other tasks. Only the organized working people, under the leadership of the Party, can have the overwhelming power to launch a vigorous health campaign across the country to change customs and eliminate the four pests; the masses have personally experienced the benefits of paying attention to hygiene and eliminating the four pests for production and life in the past few years; in the past few years, many hygiene models have emerged in the movement, and they have provided experience in transitioning from a concentrated campaign to a regular one (the main ones are: establishing systems, especially covenants established by the masses themselves; establishing grassroots mass organizations; launching concentrated campaigns at certain times to continuously improve the achievements of regular hygiene work); especially the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) puts forward the requirements of eliminating the four pests and eliminating several seriously harmful diseases; coupled with the rapid development of production and construction in various aspects such as industry and agriculture in the past few years, the improvement of people's material and cultural life has inspired the masses with thousands of pounds of energy and strengthened the masses' hundredfold confidence, giving the masses strength, direction, hope, and methods.

    目前爱国卫生运动的形势
    群众力量排山倒海　不少地区四害消灭
    新华社8日讯　全国爱国卫生运动委员会负责人最近对本社记者发表谈话，概述了目前爱国卫生运动开展的形势。他说：在中国共产党的领导下，广大群众已把爱国卫生运动和生产、生活紧密地结合起来，成为他们生产和生活中不可缺少的一部分，因而就成为他们自觉的运动。正是这种群众的自觉行动有了党的坚强领导，使运动形成波澜壮阔的新高潮。
    运动高潮的特点
    负责人说，爱国卫生运动发展到目前以除四害为中心的新高潮，它的广度和深度超过了往年。现在运动已经逐渐普及到全国广大地区的各个角落。1952年运动开始时，运动的主要内容是反对美帝国主义的细菌战，还没有深入地具体结合生产和日常生活。现在，讲卫生、除四害开始成为许多群众日常生活的一部分；群众对运动的认识比过去提高了，经验丰富得多了，领导运动的各级组织也更健全了。这是这次运动高潮的特点。
    口号响亮　成绩巨大
    现在，许多省提出了响亮的口号：每县一个“四无”乡，每乡一个“四无”社，每个市区一条“四无”街。全国每乡每街、家家户户都动起来了。江苏省已有三千八百六十六个“四无”村、镇和居民点。山西省仅稷山、屯留两县在这次突击运动中已捕灭鼠雀六十四万三千只，“四无”村已从过去的七十二个增至一百零四个。河北省靠近内蒙古的张北、尚义、康保、商都、沽源等五个县基本上已消灭了家鼠和野鼠。湖南省通过灭蚊、灭孑孓防蚊、治疟等办法，全省1957年疟疾患者比1956年减少了43％，现在他们又满怀信心地提出要在1958年年内再使疟疾患者降低一半。湖南省是水田地区，也有山地，是蚊虫孳生的好地方。负责人认为，湖南在灭蚊防疟方面能取得如此成绩，其他各省也不难取得如此成绩。江苏省镇江市是血吸虫病流行地区，沿码头的六千条船上的船民过去多年来都把粪便倒在江里，习以为常，造成了血吸虫病传布的因素。从1955年起到现在，船民实行了粪便管理，在岸上设置粪窖，控制了血吸虫病的传播，同时每年还可积肥八十万担。江西省余江县发动群众土埋钉螺（血吸虫病的媒介），一举三得：基本上消灭了血吸虫病；清沟除草，沟泥草皮积了肥；填旧沟开新沟，有计划地进行了灌溉，使许多旱田变成水田，增加了粮食产量。余江县农民潘世发，曾经患过十多年的血吸虫病，长期不能劳动生产，还要吃药，因此生活很困苦，这几年来由于搞好了卫生，控制了血吸虫病的传染，国家又替他治好了病，现在他已成为农业劳动模范。天津市蔬菜、食品、杂货等行业也把卫生工作和生产紧密结合起来。例如出售酱油部门不但做好一般清扫工作，而且改进了历史上沿用的管理操作办法，使酱缸、酱油里不生蛆。南京郊区的五老村、广州市的金花街、广西省大苗山雨玉村、江西省九江市、浙江省金华县邢八染村、抚顺露天矿、天津海关等地区和单位从1952年运动开始到现在经常不懈地坚持清洁卫生的习惯，其中前三个地区，是1952年全国卫生模范，五年来它们的卫生状况一直符合着这个光荣称号。
    还需要排除思想障碍
    负责人向记者介绍了这些伟大成绩后接着说，现在还有一部分地区和单位卫生工作没有做好，一经检查，主要的原因都是由于一部分群众、特别是少数领导干部思想上有障碍。一种障碍是对讲卫生除四害的重大意义认识不足，认为搞卫生运动妨碍生产；另一种障碍是对于讲卫生除四害缺乏信心，因而领导不力，群众没有发动起来。负责人说，有些人以为消灭四害没有理论根据，对于四害能否基本消灭怀疑很多。负责人着重指出：我们的运动是家家户户动手，人人动手，是普遍地、大片地搞，这里消灭了四害，那里也同时在消除，到处都在消除，各处都要消灭；有了突击性的高潮，还有经常的工作，尽管残余的四害能繁殖，但是在经常的卫生工作中它们将不断地被歼灭，势必越来越少，终于达到基本消灭的目的，前面所列举的许多成绩，已足以摧毁这种保守思想。负责人说，理论是从实践中概括出来的，我们实践的结果是：不少地区四害被消灭了，千百年来不讲卫生的习惯改变过来了，清洁卫生工作坚持下来了，田增产，人增寿，爱国卫生运动不但对于防除人类的疾病和保证牲畜健壮有很大好处，而且又积了肥，改进了水利，提高了庄稼产量。这就是搞爱国卫生运动除四害的理论。
    群众有排山倒海的力量
    负责人进一步指出，这次运动高潮能够迅速达到这样广泛深入的程度，是由于农业、手工业合作化的完成。组织起来的优越性不但表现在生产上，也表现在卫生工作和其他各种工作上，组织起来的劳动人民在党的领导下才能有排山倒海的力量在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地掀起移风易俗、消灭四害的卫生运动；群众在这几年来切身体会到了讲卫生除四害对生产、生活的好处；几年来运动中出现了众多的卫生模范，并且提供了从突击运动转为经常化的经验（其中主要的是：建立制度，特别是群众自己订立的公约；建立基层群众组织；在一定时期掀起突击运动，以不断提高经常卫生工作获得的成绩）；特别是全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中提出了除四害和消灭几种危害重大的疾病的要求；加上这几年来工、农业等各方面生产建设的突飞猛进，人民物质、文化生活的提高，鼓起了群众千斤的劲头，坚定了群众百倍的信心，使群众有了力量，有了方向，有了奔头，有了办法。
