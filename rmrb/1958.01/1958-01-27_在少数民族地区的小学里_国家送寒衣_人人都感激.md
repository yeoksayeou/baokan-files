In Primary Schools in Minority Areas,
    The State Sends Winter Clothing
    Everyone is Grateful
    (Our Newspaper News) Recently, the state allocated over 20,000 yuan in educational subsidies to the Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County. Among them, 10,191 yuan was used as hardship subsidies for minority students, and the rest was used to add sports equipment and books to minority primary and secondary schools, and for amateur Mongolian education work.
    After these funds were distributed to various minority primary and secondary schools and schools with minority students, they adopted democratic evaluation based on the family difficulties of minority children, graded them, and purchased practical items such as flour, cotton, cotton hats, cotton shoes, and stationery according to actual needs and distributed them to minority children in need. For example, Wu Fengqin (Mongolian), a student at Balang Township Primary School, was facing great difficulties at home and had to drop out of school because she didn't have a cotton coat. This time, when she put on the cotton coat that the state bought for her, her father was moved to tears and said to Wu Fengqin: "Child, you must study hard and listen to the teacher, so that you can be worthy of our benefactors, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." A parent of a Mongolian primary school student said to the students, "You children are lucky to be born in good times. The state spends so much money to build classrooms of red brick with full glass windows, with warm heating inside, to provide you with schooling. How happy you should be!" Now, every minority primary and secondary school also has complete sports and recreational equipment, such as bows and arrows, wrestling suits, vaulting boxes, volleyballs, basketballs, etc. There are also many kinds of books. Whenever books are allocated, the children shout: Chairman Mao has sent books to the children on our grasslands, bringing new knowledge! Then they cheer, Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao! (Yu Lin)

    在少数民族地区的小学里
    国家送寒衣
    人人都感激
    本报讯　最近国家拨给前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县少数民族教育补助费两万多元。其中一万零一百九十一元作为少数民族学生困难补助金，其余的给少数民族中、小学添置了体育器材、图书和用在业余蒙古族教育工作上。
    这批款子分别发到各少数民族中、小学和有少数民族学生的学校后，他们根据少数民族儿童家庭困难情况，采取了民主评定，分等排级，按着实际需要购买了白面、棉花、棉帽、棉鞋、文具等实物发给了少数民族困难的儿童。如八郎乡小学吴凤琴（蒙古族）同学，家庭生活很困难，没有穿上棉衣，就停学了。这次当她穿上国家给她买的棉衣时，她父亲被感动的流下眼泪，对吴凤琴说：“孩子，要好好学习，听老师的话，才能对得起咱们的恩人共产党和毛主席呀。”蒙古族小学一位学生家长对学生们说，“你们这些孩子算生在好年月了，国家花那么多的钱盖红砖房满玻璃的教室，屋里烧的暖暖的，供给你们念书，这该有多么幸福啊。”现在，每个少数民族中、小学的体育文娱设备也很齐全，如弓箭、角力服、跳箱、排球、篮球等。各类的图书也很多，每当拨来图书时，孩子们都高呼：毛主席给我们草原上的孩子送书来了，送新的知识来了。接着欢呼共产党万岁、毛主席万岁。　（玉琳）
