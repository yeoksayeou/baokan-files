Xinhua News Agency, January 29th. The Soviet "Soviet Culture Newspaper" recently published a dispatch reporting on the so-called chimpanzee painting exhibitions held by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, England, and in Los Angeles, USA.

As everyone knows, not long ago a sensational piece of news spread throughout the Western world, claiming that a new "genius" had appeared in the Western painting world—Betsy, a chimpanzee in Baltimore Park. The success and honor of this American chimpanzee aroused jealousy among some people at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. Thus, another "art master" appeared in the West—Congo, a chimpanzee at the London Zoo.

In order to decide which chimpanzee should receive the glory of first place, someone came up with an idea, advocating a joint exhibition. This exhibition was recently held with great seriousness at the prestigious Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. A total of thirty-six chimpanzee "creations" were exhibited. Many visitors to the exhibition talked with great interest about the development of the chimpanzees' "personal" style in their creations, their "remarkable characteristics," and their influence on modern art.

Alloway, the Deputy Director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, also broadcast his impressions of the exhibition on the radio. This "scholar" said, "The problem is, we don't really know what art is. We all have our own views on what art is, and there is no consensus."

Significantly, the institute ultimately gave these "works" a ridiculous evaluation, claiming that they were "the only truly abstract works of art in the entire history of painting."

### 资产阶级艺术日趋没落  美英猩猩联合“画”展大受吹捧

    资产阶级艺术日趋没落
    美英猩猩联合“画”展大受吹捧
    新华社29日讯　苏联“苏维埃文化报”最近发表了一篇通讯，报道了英国伦敦现代艺术研究所和美国洛杉矶举办的所谓猩猩绘画展览会。
    大家知道，不久前西方世界传遍了一个耸人听闻的消息，说是西方绘画界出现了一个新的“天才”——巴尔的摩公园里的黑猩猩别特西。这个美国猩猩的成功和荣誉引起了伦敦现代艺术研究所一些人的忌妒。于是西方又出现了一个“艺术大师”——伦敦动物园的黑猩猩刚果。
    为了决定哪个猩猩应得首位的光荣，有人出了一个主意，主张举办一个联合展览会。这个展览会最近竟煞有介事地在堂而皇之的伦敦现代艺术研究所举行了。会上共展出了三十六幅猩猩的“创作”。许多参观展览会的人还津津有味地大谈其猩猩创作上的“个人”风格的发展，它们的“卓越的特点”以及它们对现代艺术的影响。
    伦敦现代艺术研究所副所长阿洛维还在广播电台发表了他对展览会的观感。这位“学者”说，“问题在于，我们并不知道到底什么是艺术。对什么是艺术，我们各有各的看法，看法的一致是不存在的。”
    意味深长的是，这个研究所最后对这些“作品”的荒唐估价，它认为，它们是“整个绘画艺术史上唯一真正的抽象艺术作品”。
