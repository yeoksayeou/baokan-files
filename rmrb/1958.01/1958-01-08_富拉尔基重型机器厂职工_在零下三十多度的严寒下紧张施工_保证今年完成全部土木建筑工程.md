Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Workers constructing the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant are carrying out winter construction in severe cold of over minus 30 degrees Celsius. They aim to complete all civil engineering construction of the plant by the end of this year.

　　The five main factory buildings, which are the core of the plant, are the main task of civil engineering construction this year. Currently, workers are hoisting steel beams, steel columns, steel roof trusses and pouring concrete foundations; the riverside pumping station will also be rushed to completion during the winter dry season to ensure the supply of water for factory construction and production. During winter construction, 260,000 cubic meters of earthwork will also be excavated and backfilled across the entire construction site. On the ground, which is frozen as hard as stone, construction workers have hammered in thousands of iron rods and passed electric current through them to thaw the soil, making it soft and easy to excavate.

　　The most intense construction is the steel structure hoisting project for the main factory buildings such as the steel casting and hydraulic press workshops. Here, steam supply vehicles equipped with small boilers arrive at the construction site every morning to use steam to thaw the internal combustion engine water and oil pipes of construction machinery such as cranes and bulldozers. When the crane is started, the agile crane workers immediately climb the ladders on the steel columns and ascend to the top of the more than ten-meter-high roof frame to carry out assembly work. According to winter construction regulations, each person can take a small brazier up to work in the frigid high altitude while heating themselves, but the crane workers are afraid that heating will affect their speed, so no one is willing to take one. They say, "We warm up as soon as we work."

　　On the foundation construction site of a factory building covered by a huge windbreak, many dump trucks wearing "cotton overcoats" arrive every day, unloading the steaming concrete into the mortar troughs. Many concrete workers immediately push small iron carts quickly to send the mortar into the column foundation formwork. Surveyors check the temperature and strength of the foundation concrete day and night, taking various measures to ensure the quality of the foundation project.

　　The Nenjiang River surface has already frozen two meters thick, but the riverside pumping station construction site, which is surrounded by temporary earth dikes, often spouts several streams of icy spring water seeping through. More than a thousand workers are working on the icy and waterlogged riverbed, driving sheet piles, excavating quicksand, draining water, and pouring concrete for the walls and base plates of the pump house. The bottom sealing of the pump house has now been completed, and the concrete pouring of the entire pump house has begun.

### 富拉尔基重型机器厂职工  在零下三十多度的严寒下紧张施工  保证今年完成全部土木建筑工程

    富拉尔基重型机器厂职工
    在零下三十多度的严寒下紧张施工
    保证今年完成全部土木建筑工程
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　建设富拉尔基重型机器厂的职工正在冒着摄氏零下三十多度的严寒进行冬季施工。他们要在今年年底全部完成这个工厂的土木建筑工程。
    作为工厂核心的五大主厂房是今年土木建筑工程的主要任务。现在，工人们正在吊装钢梁、钢柱、钢屋架和浇灌混凝土基础；江上水泵站也要趁冬季枯水期间抢建完成，保证工厂建设和生产用水的供应。冬季施工中全工地还要挖掘和回填二十六万立方公尺的土方。建筑工人们在冻得像石头一样硬的土地上，锤入了成千上万根铁棒，通入电流解冻土壤，以便使土松软容易挖掘。
    施工最紧张的是铸钢、水压机等主厂房的钢结构吊装工程。在这里，每天清早都有装着小锅炉的蒸汽供应车开到工地，用蒸汽使起重机、推土机等施工机械的内燃机水油管解冻。当起重机发动起来以后，矫健的起重工人立刻攀着钢柱上的云梯，登上十多丈高的房架上进行装配工作。按照冬季施工规定，在寒风凛冽的高空作业，每人可以带一只小烤火炉上去，一边工作，一边烤火，但是起重工人们怕烤火影响速度，谁也不愿意带。他们说：“一劳动就浑身暖和了”。
    被庞大的防风棚笼罩起来的一座厂房基础工程工地上，每天开来许多辆全身穿着“棉大氅”的翻斗汽车，它们把载运来的热腾腾的混凝土，卸在灰浆槽里，许多混凝土工人立刻飞快地推着小铁车把灰浆送进柱子基础的模板里。测量人员日夜检查基础混凝土的温度和强度，采取各种措施保证基础工程的质量。
    嫩江江面已经结了两公尺厚的冰，但是用临时土堤围起来的江上水泵站工地，却常常冒出几股江水浸透过来的冰凉泉涌。一千多个工人就在冰冷积水的江底工地上打板椿、挖游泥流砂、排水和浇灌泵房的墙和底板混凝土，现在已经完成了泵房封底工程，开始了全部泵房的混凝土浇灌。
