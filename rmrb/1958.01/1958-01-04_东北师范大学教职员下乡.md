    Northeast Normal University Faculty and Staff Go to the Countryside
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) Ninety-eight faculty and staff members from Northeast Normal University have gone to the countryside. Among the cadres who went to the countryside are Zhao Qingwei, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and Deputy Director of the Department of Political Education; Zhao Peilin, Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Department of Political Education; He Yunwen, Director of the Office of the Department of Political Education; and Bai Gao, Deputy Section Chief of the General Affairs Section. They have already settled down in the "Road to Brightness" agricultural cooperative in the suburbs of the city.
    Cheng Fangwu, President of Northeast Normal University, encouraged everyone to put aside their airs, humbly learn from the peasants, and obtain the qualifications of working people. Everyone expressed that they would work as a new type of farmer in the glorious agricultural post. (Pang Yuqi)
