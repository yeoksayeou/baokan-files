Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Chemical Industry has fully ignited the flames of anti-waste as it conducts thorough rectification, with all staff posting more than 1,500 big-character posters exposing many serious cases of waste that violate the policy of building the nation through diligence and thrift.

The Ministry of Chemical Industry began a thorough rectification centered on examining the implementation of national policies and guidelines more than a month ago. Once the specialized airing of views began, it extensively exposed a large number of policy-related issues from all aspects.

The anti-waste specialized airing of views in the Ministry of Chemical Industry is now more in-depth and powerful than general rectification's airing of views. Many big-character posters are written jointly by several people after detailed investigation and research, and individual units are airing their views collectively as an entire division or section. Ninety-five percent of engineers and 80% of directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus have written big-character posters. Some engineers and directors/deputy directors of departments and bureaus did not participate in the airing of views during general rectification, but now they are exposing the waste phenomena they are most familiar with in big-character posters, and many of their big-character posters have hit the nail on the head.

The large amount of waste phenomena exposed by the masses involves all aspects of planning, design, capital construction, production management, and technical reform, as well as many enterprises and institutions under its jurisdiction. Many factories and mines have suffered significant losses due to improper planning, frequent changes in plans, and poor construction management. One big-character poster exposed a "modernized, automated workshop specifically for waste," an automated "waste acid" treatment workshop built by the Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory with an investment of more than 100,000 yuan. This workshop annually eliminates the corrosiveness of dilute sulfuric acid decomposed from the factory's ?amine workshop before discarding it. If this dilute sulfuric acid were processed and refined, it could be turned into chemical raw materials with an annual value of 180,000 yuan. Not only has it not been utilized, but about 60,000 yuan is spent annually to eliminate the corrosiveness of the dilute sulfuric acid. Given the shortage of sulfuric acid in our country, this automated workshop has turned more than 200,000 yuan of assets into waste. A big-character poster titled "Eight Years of Resistance War to Achieve Victory, Eight Years of Factory Construction Not Yet Completed" exposed that the Taiyuan Chemical Plant has been under construction for eight years, with a capital construction investment of 73 million yuan. This sum of money could have built twelve plastic factories with an annual output of more than 45 million tons of various plastics, but due to poor planning, not a single workshop in the plant has been put into production by the end of 1957. In terms of capital construction, the loss of materials is also very serious due to lack of management and responsibility. It was revealed that the materials lost during the construction of the Jilin Chemical Zone alone could fill eighty rubber-wheeled carts, including valuable imported materials such as small pieces of stainless steel plates and copper plates. According to people familiar with the area, this is just a small account compared to the entire waste phenomenon in the chemical zone. The big-character poster "More than Ten and Less than Ten" collectively aired by the Comprehensive Division of the Production Department, detailed the waste caused by bureaucracy in the management of technical measures. In the section "More overspending, less saving," this big-character poster stated that out of the ministry's 27 enterprises, 11 enterprises overspent in 1957. The Dagu Chemical Plant planned a total investment of 1.83 million yuan, but the overspending amounted to 1.33 million yuan. Moreover, most of the overspending units "acted first and reported later," rarely seeking instructions or reporting in advance. Serious waste has also formed in terms of product backlog. A big-character poster titled "It's Time to Find a New Home for Chlorine Gas" spoke out for chlorine gas, one of the important raw materials for the organic chemical industry. The big-character poster said that the ministry has more than 70,000 tons of chlorine gas products such as 666, DDT, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder stockpiled in warehouses without sales outlets, and the value of these materials will reach 63 million yuan.

The big-character posters also comprehensively exposed the prominent waste phenomena in the Shenyang Chemical Research Institute. The equipment and instruments lost and damaged by the research institute in the past period, for which there are records, are worth more than 190,000 yuan. The management of this institute is so chaotic that the extra-budgetary materials inventoried from the warehouse include as much as sixty taels of gold and silver. This chaotic situation has greatly facilitated thieves. The stolen goods found in the home of an arrested thief from the research institute numbered 109 pieces, including platinum crucibles, microscopes, radio equipment, and other valuable items. There were as many as eight sweaters woven with stolen wool (used for experimental research), and as many as forty stolen work clothes. This thief's home was simply a small warehouse. The equipment, instruments, and experimental medicines stockpiled in the research institute's warehouse are worth approximately two to three million yuan.

The Ministry of Chemical Industry is still continuing to expose various waste phenomena. In order to seriously debate and rectify the exposed problems, the ministry has formed specialized rectification groups in five areas: planning, design, capital construction, production, and research, with the minister, vice-ministers, and assistant ministers taking charge, organizing specialized debates, and making conclusions and proposing reform plans on major issues. The leadership of the ministry believes that the anti-waste specialized rectification is extremely complex, involving a wide range of aspects, and cannot be handled by a few people or a single unit. It is necessary to cross between upper and lower levels and between various departments to launch extensive debate. The leadership must actively organize everyone to debate, clarify right and wrong, and bravely initiate self-criticism to conduct serious inspections. When organizing specialized debates, it is necessary to grasp typical specific topics and debate them thoroughly to educate the entire work and the majority of people. Currently, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has been organizing a specialized debate on the sulfuric acid standard design issue since the 24th, because according to mass exposure, the ministry has found that the standard design currently underway, although greatly improved compared to past designs, still has significant waste. If improvements are not made quickly and a large number of factories are built across the country according to this standard design, it will cause a large waste of more than 40 to 50 million yuan. In order to thoroughly debate this topic and immediately improve the design, in addition to convening people who posted big-character posters, relevant design personnel, and other relevant units to participate in the meeting, relevant enterprises in Shanghai, Nanjing, Fushun, Dalian, and other places will also send people to participate in this week-long debate.

    抓着浪费典型辩深辩透
    化工部讨论改进硫酸厂标准设计防患未然
    据新华社讯　化学工业部在深入整改中全面燃起了反浪费的烈火。全部工作人员已经贴出一千五百多张大字报，揭发了许多违反勤俭建国方针的严重浪费现象。
    化工部在一个多月前就开始了以检查执行国家政策方针为主的深入整改。专题鸣放一开始，就极其广泛地从各个方面揭发了大量有关化学工业的政策方针问题。
    化工部反浪费的专题鸣放，现在已经比一般整改时的大鸣大放更加深入、更加有力。许多大字报都是几个人经过详细调查研究后联名写出来的，还有个别单位是一个处、一个科的集体鸣放。95％的工程师和80％的司局长都写了大字报。有些工程师和司、局长在一般整改时没有参加鸣放，现在都在大字报上揭发了他们最为熟悉的浪费现象，他们的许多大字报都击中了问题的要害。
    群众揭发出来的大量浪费现象，涉及到计划、设计、基本建设、生产管理、技术改革各个方面和所属的许多企业、事业单位。许多厂矿因为计划不当、计划多变以及施工管理不善，造成了重大损失。有一张大字报揭发了一个“现代化、自动化专门浪费的车间”，这个车间是东北制药总厂投资十多万元建设的自动化的“废酸”处理车间。这个车间每年要将厂里?胺车间分解出来的稀硫酸消除腐蚀性后扔掉。这种稀硫酸如果经过加工提炼可以变成年产价值十八万元的化学原料，现在不仅没有利用起来，而且为消除稀硫酸的腐蚀性，每年还要支出六万元左右的费用。在我国硫酸供应不足的情况下，这个自动化的车间就把二十多万元的资财变成了废渣。一张题为“八年抗战获得胜利，建厂八年尚未完成”的大字报，揭发了太原化工厂筹建已经八年，八年中基本建设投资七千三百万元，这笔钱可以建成十二个年产各种塑料四千五百多万吨的塑料厂，但是由于计划安排得不好，这个厂直到1957年底还没有一个车间能投入生产。在基本建设方面，由于无人管理负责，材料的丢失现象也十分严重。据揭发，吉林化工区在建设中仅仅丢失的材料一项，就可以装满八十辆胶轮大车，其中包括小块不锈钢板、紫铜板等贵重的进口物资。据熟悉这个地区的人估计，如果拿这一项和化工区的整个浪费现象比较，只不过是其中不大的一笔账。生产司综合处集体鸣放的“十多与十少”的大字报，详细地揭发了技术措施管理中官僚主义所造成的浪费现象。这张大字报在“超支的多，节余的少”一项里说，这个部的二十七个企业单位，就有十一个企业单位在1957年超支，大沽化工厂计划总共投资一百八十三万元，而超支数却达一百三十三万元。而且超支单位大多是“先斩后奏”，很少事先请示报告。在产品积压方面也形成了严重的浪费。一张题为“该为氯气找寻新婆家”的大字报，为有机化学工业重要原料之一的氯气鸣不平。大字报说，这个部有七万多吨氯气产品如六六六、滴滴涕和盐酸、漂白粉等物资积压在仓库里没有销路，这些物资的价值将达六千三百万元。
    大字报还全面地揭发了沈阳化工研究院的突出的浪费现象，这个研究院在过去一个时期中丢失、损坏的设备、仪器，有账可查的即值十九万多元。这个院的管理工作竟混乱到这样的地步：从仓库中清点出来的账外物资，仅黄金、白银便有六十两。这种混乱情况给盗窃分子大开方便之门，这个研究院从一个被捕的盗窃分子家中搜查到的脏物就有一百零九件，其中有白金坩锅、显微镜、无线电器材等贵重物品，用盗窃来的毛线（作试验研究用的）织成的毛衣就有八件，盗窃的工作服竟达四十件之多，这个盗窃分子的家里简直成了一个小仓库。这个研究院的仓库积压的设备仪器和试验用药品，约值二、三百万元。
    化学工业部现在还在继续揭发各种浪费现象。为了对揭发出来的问题认真地进行辩论和整改，这个部已经组成了计划、设计、基本建设、生产、研究事业五个方面的专题整改小组，由部长、副部长、部长助理分工负责，组织专题辩论，并就重大问题做出结论和提出改革方案。这个部的领导上认为反浪费的专题整改极为复杂，牵涉方面很广，绝非少数人或一个单位能够办到，必须上下之间、各部门之间交叉起来，展开大争大辩。领导上要一面积极组织大家辩论，辩出是非，一面还要勇敢地引火烧身，进行认真检查。在组织专题辩论的时候，必须抓住典型的具体题目，并且必须辩深辩透，才能对整个工作和大多数人有教育意义。目前化工部已从24日起组织对硫酸标准设计问题进行专题大辩论，因为根据群众的揭发，这个部已经发觉正在进行的标准设计，虽然比过去的设计大有改进，但仍有很大的浪费，如不迅速改进，按这个标准设计全国大批建厂，将会造成四、五千万元以上的大浪费。为了把这个题目辩透，立即改善设计，化工部除召集贴大字报的人、主管设计人员和其他有关单位参加会议外，上海、南京、抚顺、大连等地的有关企业单位，也将派人参加这个为时一周左右的大辩论。
