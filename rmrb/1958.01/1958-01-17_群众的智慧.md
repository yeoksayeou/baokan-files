    The Wisdom of the Masses
    Dong Shengqun
    The Carrying Pole Retires to its Village
    For millennia, on Paoma Ridge,
  The carrying pole rested on shoulders,
    Shoulders rubbed red and swollen;
  A touch brings secret sorrow.
    This year, the whole township builds water conservancy,
  Ten thousand people offer good ideas,
    Transporting earth like mountains;
  The carrying pole retires to its village. …
    The sun sets, and wisps of smoke rise from the roofs of every house. As I entered Paoma Township in Dangyang County, a series of beautiful songs came from the mountain hollow of the Wanjiachong Reservoir. Who is singing? And why do they say "the carrying pole retires to its village?"
    The next day, I accompanied the Yichang Special District Water Conservancy Construction Visiting Group to visit the Xinlong, Taishan, and Jingshan agricultural cooperatives in this township. Sure enough, at every construction site, I saw not carrying poles, but herds of cattle and various types of carts everywhere.
    The person in charge of the Paoma Township Party Branch told me that, except for three cooperatives where a few people still carried earth by shoulder, the other eight cooperatives in the township had all achieved "cartization." He said that using carts to transport earth generally increased work efficiency by two to three times compared to carrying it by shoulder. Huang Dingcui (female), a primary school graduate at Wanjiachong Reservoir, can transport more than sixteen cubic meters of earth every day driving two oxen. The person in charge of the branch also told me that, due to the improvement of tools, the intensity of labor has also been greatly reduced. More than two hundred seven-year-old children and seventy-five-year-old elderly people in the township also participated in the labor.

    "Living Pestles" and "Stone Roller Pounders"
    We saw some old people and children leading cattle to plow or roll earth at various construction sites in Paoma Township. This is the so-called "ox-driven pounder." The members here call the cattle "living pestles." Some members even wrote "Living Pestle of Five Hundred Jin" on the heads of the cattle with red and green paper.
    The "living pestle" came to the construction site and gave people a great help. Originally, the earth had to be pounded four times with a pounder, but now it only needs to be pounded three times, because one pounding with a "living pestle" is equivalent to three poundings by hand.
    We also saw a "stone roller pounder" in Xinlong Cooperative, which was created by the old member Li Wuzhen and his three sons. The "stone roller pounder" is simple in structure, using a long tree pole with a large stone roller tied to one end, placed on a four-legged frame. Three people pull down the other end, and releasing it makes a pound. After each pound, the four-legged frame automatically steps forward. The "stone roller pounder" is very efficient. Only three people can pound 1,500 cubic meters of earth a day, which is four times higher than the efficiency of eight people using a bar pounder, and can insert signs and irrigate water in one pounding. The people in the visiting group were very interested in the "stone roller pounder." Although everyone was very tired from walking, they all wanted to try this semi-automated advanced tool. Xiao Chijiu, Secretary of the Yichang Prefectural Committee, even gave it a name - "Lever Pounding Machine."

        Iron Will
    A cooperative cadre of Taishan Agricultural Cooperative told me that the cadres and masses in their township were simply obsessed with improving tools. Comrade Feng Deman, the second secretary of the township Party branch, helped the masses make tools for several nights without sleeping. Once, after the cocks crowed twice in the middle of the night, he went alone in the bone-chilling cold wind to check the situation of the members rushing to make tools. Drowsily, he suddenly heard the sound of pounding and the songs of the pounder, "Yo-ho-hey-ya, yo-ho-hey-de," and he was startled to realize that he was dozing off on the road.
    Comrade Zhang Tiangao, who works in this township, said that in order to overcome the contradiction of insufficient labor force and to successfully complete production tasks, all the cadres and the broad masses in the township were overcoming difficulties with iron will; everyone was trying their best to improve tools and improve work efficiency. Hu Zonghuai, director of the credit cooperative, carried an axe day and night to mobilize the masses to offer ideas and guide the masses to improve tools. Wang Kaiying, director of Jingshan Agricultural Cooperative, tried every means to make stone rollers. Zheng Shiying, a female member of Songshan Cooperative, used paper to cut out the shape of tools and worked with her lover for several nights in a row, finally making two earth-delivery vehicles. In this way, with one heart and not distinguishing between day and night, the township produced more than 500 various advanced tools. A comrade in the visiting group praised with deep meaning: "The masses have solved the contradiction between labor and work with their own wisdom and strength. It is truly a great miracle."

    群众的智慧

    扁担告老还乡
    千万年来跑马冈，
  扁担常在肩膀上，
    双肩磨得红又肿；
  用手摸摸暗凄惶。
    今年全乡修水利，
  万人献出好主张，
    运走土方山一样；
  扁担告老还了乡。………
    太阳落山啦，家家屋顶冒出了一缕缕炊烟。当我进入当阳县跑马乡的时候，从万家冲水库那边的山坳里传出了一阵阵优美的歌声。是谁在唱呢？为什么说“扁担告老还乡呢”？
    第二天，我随同宜昌专区水利建设参观团参观了这个乡的新龙、泰山、景山三个农业社。果然，每到一处工地，看到的不是?子、扁担，而是遍地的牛群和各色各样的车队。
    跑马乡党支部负责人告诉我说：全乡十一个社除了三个社还有少数人挑土外，其余八个社全部实现了“车子化”。他说：利用车子运土，工效普遍比肩挑提高了两至三倍。万家冲水库一个小学毕业生黄定翠（女）赶着两条牛每天就能运十六方多土。支部负责人还告诉我说：由于改进了工具，劳动强度也大大降低了。全乡有二百多个七岁的小孩和七十五岁的老人也参加了劳动。“活杵头”和“石磙硪”
    我们在跑马乡各个工地上看到了一些老人和小孩牵着牛在?土或碾土，这就是所谓“牛打硪”。这里的社员们把牛称做“活杵头”。有的社员还在牛的头上用红绿纸写上“五百斤的活杵头”等字样。
    “活杵头”来到工地上，给了人们很大的帮助。原来要打四遍硪的，现在只打三遍了。因为有了“活杵头”打一遍就抵上人工打三遍。
    我们在新龙社还看到一种“石磙硪”，这是老社员李吾珍父子三人创造的。“石磙硪”构造简单，用一根长树杆，在一端绑个大石磙，放在四脚架上，三个人拉下另一端，一放就是一硪。每打一硪以后，四脚架还自动地向前跨一步。“石磙硪”的工效很高，只消三个人一天就可以打一千五百方土，比原来用条硪时八个人的工效还提高了四倍，而且打一次就能插签灌水。参观团的人们对“石磙硪”很感兴趣，大家虽然走得很累了，也都要去试试这种半自动化的先进工具。宜昌地委书记萧持久同志还给它取了个名字——“杠杆打硪机”。
        钢铁的意志
    泰山农业社的一位社干部告诉我说，他们乡里的干部群众为了改进工具简直都入迷了。乡里党支部第二书记冯德满同志，帮助群众制工具好几夜没睡觉。一次，深夜鸡叫两遍了，他一个人冒着冷得刺骨的寒风，到处去检查社员赶制工具的情况。他昏昏沉沉的突然听到打硪声和硪号子的歌声，“唷?嘿呀，唷?嘿的”，他猛然一惊，才发觉自己在路上打瞌睡。
    在这个乡工作的张天高同志说，为了克服劳力不足的矛盾，为了顺利地完成生产任务，全乡干部和广大群众，人人都在用钢铁的意志克服困难；人人都在千方百计的改进工具，提高工效。信用社主任胡宗怀白天黑夜背起斧头到处发动群众献计和指导群众改进工具。景山农业社主任王开英想方设法制造石硪。松山社女社员郑世英用纸剪成工具样子，和爱人俩一连忙了几个通宵，终于制成了两部送土车。这样，人心一致，不分昼夜的干，全乡就制出了五百多件各式各样的先进工具。一位参观团的同志意味深长的赞扬说：“群众用自己的智慧和力量，解决了劳力和活路的矛盾，真是一个伟大的奇迹。”
