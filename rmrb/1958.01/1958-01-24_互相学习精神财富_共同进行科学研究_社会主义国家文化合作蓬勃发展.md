Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: The "Pravda" recently published an article by Mozhayev on the cultural cooperation of socialist countries.

The article stated that cultural cooperation among socialist countries is developing on the basis of treaties of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance, as well as various cultural agreements. At present, socialist countries have signed a total of about seventy general cultural agreements and about two hundred agreements on the exchange of films, radio programs, books, students, tourists, and so on.

The article then stated that the people of socialist countries have their own cultures with historical traditions and national characteristics. These traditions and characteristics, of which each country is proud, are now being carefully protected and developed. Equal and mutually enriching cooperation among socialist countries helps to achieve this. However, the nature of "cultural cooperation" between imperialist countries is quite the opposite. This kind of cultural cooperation always leads to the establishment of ideological hegemony and the suppression and assimilation of the national cultures of dependent countries. "Cultural cooperation" is often a guise for the ideological expansion of imperialist countries.

The article stated that during the cultural revolution in the fraternal socialist countries, the Communist and Workers' Parties of these countries attached great importance to the creative application of the rich experience in cultural construction accumulated by the Soviet Union. The Soviet people also showed great interest in the national cultures of fraternal countries, learning and studying the great spiritual wealth of fraternal countries with love.

The article then stated that the long-term cultural cooperation agreements signed by the Soviet government with all socialist countries in recent years have helped to further consolidate cultural ties among socialist countries. The mutual dispatch of various delegations and personal contacts plays a particularly important role in this regard. At present, not only scientists, actors, and artists are actively participating in cultural exchanges, but also thousands of workers in socialist countries.

The article stated that another new phenomenon in the development of cultural relations among socialist countries is the increasing use of an important form of cooperation: creative cooperation between scientists and cultural figures from different countries in jointly conducting scientific research and creating general works of art. Recently, this form has also been actively adopted: holding international conferences in various scientific and cultural departments. In 1957 alone, more than 500 scientific workers from socialist countries came to the Soviet Union to participate in various scientific workers' conferences.

The article stated that the new atmosphere in the development of cultural cooperation among socialist countries has brought the issue of further improving the organizational forms of this cooperation and conscientiously improving the coordination of the competent authorities in this regard to the agenda. In this regard, it must be taken into account that the cultural cooperation of socialist countries will continue to develop year by year, because communism is characterized by a prosperous spiritual culture, which must be created by the joint efforts of all socialist countries.

    互相学习精神财富　共同进行科学研究
    社会主义国家文化合作蓬勃发展
    据新华社莫斯科23日电“真理报”最近发表了莫日阿耶夫的一篇文章，论社会主义国家的文化合作。
    文章说，社会主义国家的文化合作正在友好合作和互助条约以及各种文化协定的基础上发展。现在，社会主义国家之间一共签订了约七十个一般性的文化协定，约二百个关于交换影片、广播节目、书籍、留学生、旅行者等等问题的协定。
    文章接着说，社会主义国家的人民有着自己的具有历史传统和民族特点的文化。每个国家引以为自豪的这些传统和特点，现在正在得到谨慎的保护和发展。社会主义国家之间平等和互相丰富的合作有助于做到这一点。但是，帝国主义国家之间的“文化合作”的性质恰恰相反，这种文化合作总是导致建立思想霸权、抑制和同化附属国家的民族文化。“文化合作”常常是帝国主义国家实行思想扩张的幌子。
    文章说，在兄弟的社会主义国家里实现文化革命的时候，这些国家的共产党和工人党十分重视创造性地运用苏联所积累的文化建设的丰富经验。苏联人对兄弟国家的民族文化也表现出极为深厚的兴趣，怀着热爱的心情学习和研究兄弟国家的伟大的精神财富。
    文章接着说，近年来苏联政府同所有社会主义国家签订的长期文化合作协定有助于进一步巩固社会主义国家间的文化联系。在这方面互派各种代表团和个人接触起着特别重要的作用。目前积极参加文化交流的不仅有科学家、演员、艺术家，还有社会主义国家的成千上万的劳动者。
    文章说，发展社会主义国家文化关系方面的另一个新的现象是：越来越多地利用这种重要的合作形式，即不同国家的科学家和文化人士在共同进行科学研究和创作一般的艺术作品方面进行创造性的合作。最近还积极地采用了这种形式：举行科学和文化各部门的国际会议。仅在1957年到苏联参加各种科学工作者会议的就有社会主义国家的五百多名科学工作者。
    文章说，社会主义国家文化合作发展方面的新气象把进一步改善这种合作的组织形式、认真改进主管机关之间在这方面的协作的问题提到了日程上来。在这方面，必须考虑到这种情况：社会主义国家的文化合作将逐年不断地发展，因为共产主义是以繁荣的精神文化为标志的，这种文化要靠所有社会主义国家的共同努力来创造。
