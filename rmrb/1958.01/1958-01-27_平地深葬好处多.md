    Deep Burial on Level Ground Has Many Advantages
    Good arable land should not be taken up by cemeteries
    To the Editor:
    I support Mr. Huang Yanpei's proposal for deep burial on level ground, as published in the People's Daily on the 11th. It's a good way to bury the dead without taking up land.
    Using land for graves wastes land and creates cultivation problems. Take my clan's cemetery, for example. In less than two hundred years, half of the twelve acres of land has been taken up by graves. Based on a yield of 300 catties of grain per acre per year in previous years, that's a loss of 1,800 catties of grain per year. If you add up all the land occupied by graves across the country, I don't know how large the area would be, and how much grain would be lost each year. In my hometown, graves are not placed close together, but are arranged like a fan according to seniority, with a certain amount of space between them. We feel bad about leaving this space uncultivated, but when we do cultivate it, plows, harrows, and drills are useless; we have to use shovels and hoes to turn the soil. Larger gaps can be plowed with difficulty, but if you're not careful, the plowshare will be broken when it hits a tombstone. It's hard work and inefficient. Whenever we deal with this land, we can't help but curse it as a "damn clod of earth."
    I haven't cultivated that cemetery in recent years because I left my hometown, but I imagine it's even harder to cultivate than before because the number of graves increases every year. What worries me even more is that if the old burial methods are not changed and the existing graves on level ground are not dealt with, they will not only take up more land, but also make it difficult to irrigate and cultivate the land mechanically on a large scale.
    This is a problem that cannot be taken lightly. I believe that deep burial on level ground can solve the problem of the dead taking up land, and people will be more likely to accept it.
    Mr. Huang Yanpei has set an example for advocating deep burial on level ground by mobilizing his own family. If our cadres and staff comrades can all do as Mr. Huang did, first straighten out our own thinking, then mobilize our family members, clear their minds, and take the lead in leveling the graves, to influence and educate the masses. In this way, the old burial methods will be changed, and deep burial on level ground can be promoted.
    Agricultural cooperation not only laid the foundation for developing production and giving play to the enthusiasm of farmers, but also created conditions for changing old and unreasonable customs. Farmers' political awareness has been greatly improved, and they have learned some natural science knowledge. With the actions and influence of our cadres, under the leadership of the Party, deep burial on level ground will surely be accepted by the broad masses.
    Article 23 of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) stipulates: "Change the original unreasonable customs." I am willing to follow Mr. Huang's example, mobilize my family, and change our ancestral graves to deep burial, to do my part to change old customs and realize the provisions of the program.

    Beneficial to Production, No Loss to Human Feelings
    To the Editor:
    I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Huang Yanpei's proposal for deep burial on level ground, published on page four of the People's Daily on the 11th of this month. This is an important measure to expand and protect the area of arable land.
    Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and the funeral methods of various ethnic groups are different, but burial is still the most widespread funeral method among the Han and other ethnic groups. Judging only from the existing graves in the country today (including public cemeteries), the area of arable land or planted land occupied is already very alarming. Taking our Guanyun County as an example, there are more than 130,000 households in the county. If we calculate that each household has an average of two ancestral graves, and each grave occupies five li of land, then the whole county has more than 13,000 mu of land that cannot be cultivated all year round. Just imagine how much arable land would be occupied nationwide! If each mu of land yields hundreds of catties of grain each year, how much more grain would be harvested nationwide each year? We must calculate this account.
    Secondly, I would also like to make a suggestion regarding the specific practice of "deep burial on level ground"; Mr. Huang said: "If the family members of the deceased are enlightened, even the coffin can be dispensed with. Even if the dead person wears clothes, the usual ones are fine." I agree with this. Because people who have completely thought through this problem can indeed do it. But when I think about it again, from the perspective of the current habits of most rural and urban residents, if they see the soil being buried on the body of the deceased with their own eyes, they will inevitably feel unbearable. My suggestion is: agricultural cooperatives or a certain number of households can jointly manufacture a lathe-type transportation tool, specifically for burying the dead (this is not necessary if coffins are still used). At the same time, when burying, several horizontal pieces of wood can be placed at the pit opening about a foot (market foot) above the deceased, with some firewood and mats laid on top, and then covered with soil. In this way, on the one hand, coffins can be saved, and on the other hand, the family members' feeling of unbearable sadness at seeing the deceased covered with soil can be taken care of.
    Finally, I hope that this issue can be discussed and publicized. Because this is a matter of changing customs and habits, if we only rely on one or two people to talk about it, or publish one or two articles in newspapers and periodicals, even if it is the best and most effective method, it is impossible to adopt and promote it nationwide.

### 平地深葬好处多

专栏：读者来信

    平地深葬好处多
    不应让大好耕地给坟地占去编辑同志：
    人民日报11日刊载黄炎培先生平地深葬的倡议是个埋葬死人不占土地的好办法。我表示支持。
    为死人做坟墓而占用土地，既浪费了土地，又给人们带来了耕作上的麻烦。就拿我的同族的坟地来说，至今还不到二百年，十二亩土地已经被坟堆占去了一半。按前几年的产量，一亩地年产三百斤粮食计算，一年就少收粮食一千八百斤。如果将全国的坟墓占地加起来，不知要有多大面积，每年要少收多少粮食。在我的家乡，埋坟还不是一个紧挨一个，而要依照辈份像扇面似的向前排去，坟与坟之间都有一定空隙。对这种空隙地，不耕种吧，舍不得使其荒废；耕种吧，犁、耙、耧都施展不开，得用锹镐之类去翻地。空隙大一些的，可以勉强用犁翻，但一不小心，碰到砧墓上，犁铧就被撞毁了，费力不小，工效不高。什么时候操持这块地时，就免不了骂它几声“讨厌的土疙瘩”。
    近几年因离开家乡，没有耕种那块坟地，但是我想它只能比前几年更加不好耕种，因为坟是一年年要增多的。更使人耽心的是，旧的埋葬方法不改变，平地现有的坟墓不加处理，它不但更多的占用土地，而且将给大面积灌溉和机械耕种土地带来困难。
    这个问题的确不能轻视。我认为，就目前情况，平地深葬这个办法，既能解决死人占地问题，同时人们也比较容易接受。
    黄炎培先生为倡议平地深葬，已动员自己的家庭做出了榜样。如果我们广大干部和职工同志，都像黄老先生那样，首先搞通自己的思想，然后去动员家庭成员，打通他们的思想，带头将坟堆平掉，做出样子，以影响和教育群众。这样，旧的埋葬方法就会改变，平地深葬就可推行开来。
    农业合作化，不但为发展生产，发挥农民的积极性奠定了基础，而且对改变旧的不合理习俗创造了条件，农民的政治觉悟已大大提高，并懂得了一些自然科学知识，加上我们干部的行动和影响，在党的领导下，平地深葬的办法一定能被广大群众所接受。
    农业发展纲要（修正草案）第二十三条规定：“改变原来不合理的风俗习惯”。我愿效仿黄老先生的作法，动员家庭，将祖坟改作深葬，为改变旧习俗，实现纲要的规定尽一分力量。

    有利生产　无损人情编辑同志：
    本月11日人民日报第四版刊登了黄炎培先生平地深葬的倡议，我衷心表示赞同。这是扩大和保障耕地面积的一个重要措施。
    我国是多民族的国家，各民族的殡葬方法不一，但土葬在汉族以及其他各民族中，还是流行最广泛的一种殡葬方式。仅从今天全国现有坟墓（包括公墓）来看，所占据耕地或栽植地面已很惊人。以我们灌云县为例，全县十三万多户，以平均每户有祖坟两座、每座占土地五厘计算，全县即有一万三千多亩土地终年不得耕种。试想全国要占用多少可耕土地面积呢！每亩土地每年就以百斤粮计算的话，全国一年要增收多少粮食呢？这笔帐我们不能不去算一算。
    其次，对“平地深葬”的具体做法，我也要提一点意见；黄先生说：“如果死者家属的思想已经开通的话，连棺椁都可以省掉。死人即使穿衣服，就平常穿的好了。”这一点，我也同意。因为，完全把这问题想通了的人，的确是能够作到的。但我又一想，从目前大多数农村、城市居民的习惯来看，如果亲眼看着泥土埋在死者的身上，总还是未免不忍。我的意见是：可按农业社或者多少户为单位，公共制造一个车床式的运输工具，专作运埋死人之用（如果仍用棺椁那就没有此必要）。同时，掩埋时，在坑口离死人高尺余（市尺）地方，可着几根横木，上面铺些柴、席之类，然后着土。这样一方面可以省掉棺椁，另一方面也可照顾到家属亲睹死者着土的不忍之情。
    最后，我希望对这个问题能展开讨论和宣传。因为这是一种移风易俗的事，如果单靠一两个人说一说，或者在报刊上发表了一两篇文章，即使是一种最好最有效的方法，要想在全国范围内采用和推行那是不可能的。
