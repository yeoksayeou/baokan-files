    Injustice
    Recently, the Associated Press "news analyst" Ryan admitted: "The United States has a bad reputation in many regions of Black Africa, because many people equate the United States with colonial countries." However, Ryan believes this is "unjust."
    Why is it "unjust"? Hasn't the United States supported France's bloody colonial war in Algeria? Hasn't the United States been red-eyed in its scramble for the rich resources of the Sahara? Haven't Wall Street's monopoly capitalists infiltrated Africa on a large scale? It would be truly unjust to say that Ryan is completely ignorant of these common facts.

    冤枉
    最近美联社“新闻分析员”瑞安承认：“美国在黑色非洲的好些地区内名声很不好，因为很多人把美国和殖民国家等同起来。”但是，瑞安却认为这是“冤枉的”。
    为什么是“冤枉的”呢？难道美国没有支持法国在阿尔及利亚的血腥殖民战争？难道美国没有瞪红了眼睛去争夺撒哈拉的富源？难道华尔街的垄断资本没有大规模渗入非洲吗？如果说瑞安对于这些常识完全无知，那才真是冤枉。
