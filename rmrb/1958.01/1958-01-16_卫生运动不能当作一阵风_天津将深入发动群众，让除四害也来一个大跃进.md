Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 15th: The Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, at a meeting held on the 14th with the participation of heads of various bureaus, criticized the "passing fad" approach to the public health campaign. It was decided that starting immediately, a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests would be launched. Leaders at all levels in the city would personally go to the front lines and take action, enabling a great leap forward in Tianjin's patriotic health work.

The meeting pointed out that Tianjin had seen many areas and units that were "four-free," "three-free," or "one-free" (free of one or more of the four pests), but many units exhibited a "passing fad" phenomenon. When the campaign came, they made a sudden push, but when the campaign was over, they became silent. As a result, the number of flies and mosquitoes increased again last year, and the incidence of infectious diseases exceeded previous years. The meeting believed that the main reason for this phenomenon was that in the past, attention was only paid to top-down calls, and the masses were not fully mobilized. Therefore, in this patriotic health campaign, special emphasis is placed on mobilizing the masses from the bottom up. Streets, factories, government offices, schools, and other grassroots units will fully discuss and propose their own plans, requiring a large number of "four-free streets," "four-free factories," "four-free stores," and "four-free schools" to emerge throughout the city. On this basis, a city-wide plan will be made to systematically eliminate the four pests throughout the city.

In order to fully mobilize the masses, Tianjin will organize a propaganda team of hundreds of thousands of people, starting with extensive publicity activities.

    卫生运动不能当作一阵风
    天津将深入发动群众，让除四害也来一个大跃进
    新华社天津15日电　天津市人民委员会在14日举行的有各局负责人参加的会议上，批判了卫生运动的一阵风作法，确定从即日起开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，全市各级领导干部亲自上前线，人人动手，使天津市的爱国卫生工作来一个大跃进。
    会议指出，天津市曾经出现不少四无、三无或一无的地区和单位，但是不少单位存在一阵风现象，运动一来突击一阵，运动过去就无声无息。因此，去年蝇蚊又增多起来，传染病发病率超过了往年。会议认为造成这种现象的主要原因是过去只注意了自上而下的号召，没有充分发动群众。为此，在这次爱国卫生运动中，特别强调自下而上地发动群众，由各街道、工厂、机关、学校和其他基层单位充分讨论，提出本单位的规划，要求在全市出现大量的四无街、四无厂、四无店、四无学校，在这个基础上做出全市规划，有计划地在全市消除四害。
    为了充分发动群众，天津市将组织数十万人的宣传队伍，首先展开广泛的宣传活动。
