Cultivating Forests and Greening Cities
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: The Soviet Union will launch large-scale afforestation and greening efforts. The Russian Federation has decided to plant 344,400 hectares of forest this year and to naturally regenerate 600,000 hectares of existing forest areas. Other republics will also begin afforestation this spring. Moscow, the capitals of the union republics, and industrial centers will undergo large-scale greening.
　　
The Soviet Union is a heavily forested country, with its total forest area accounting for about one-third of the world's forest area. Almost all of the Soviet Union's forests are concentrated in the Russian Federation, which has more than one billion hectares of forest. The Urals, Siberia, the Far East, and the northern regions are almost entirely covered with forests. The cities of Moscow and Leningrad are also surrounded by large forests.
　　
The recently concluded All-Russian Federation Forest Workers Conference proposed to plant more than 3 million hectares of forest by 1965. The conference also issued a call to agricultural and forestry workers, Communist Youth League members, and young people throughout the Soviet Union, urging them to actively participate in the afforestation movement.

    培植森林　绿化城市
    苏联将展开大规模造林工作
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联将开展大规模的造林和绿化工作。俄罗斯联邦决定在今年植林三十四万四千公顷，并且要在六十万公顷原有的林区进行自然更新工作。其他共和国也要在今年春天开始造林。莫斯科、各加盟共和国首都和工业中心都要进行大规模的绿化工作。
    苏联是一个森林繁茂的国家，它的森林总面积约占世界森林面积的三分之一。苏联的森林几乎全部都集中在俄罗斯联邦，这个共和国境内共有森林十亿公顷以上。乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东和北部地区几乎遍地是森林。莫斯科、列宁格勒等城市的周围也都布满了大片森林。
    最近闭幕的全俄罗斯联邦森林工作者会议提出，到1965年，要造林三百多万公顷。会议还向苏联全国的农林工作人员、共青团员和青年发出号召，要求积极参加造林运动。
