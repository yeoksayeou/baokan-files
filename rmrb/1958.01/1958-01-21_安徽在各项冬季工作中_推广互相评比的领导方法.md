Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 18th. Anhui Province's leadership method of publicizing the progress and effectiveness of projects in various regions to promote mutual competition and evaluation, which was adopted in water conservancy construction, is now being widely promoted in other winter tasks and has achieved good results.

Recently, various progress charts have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and district and township newsletters and blackboards, publicizing the progress of various tasks such as fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, field management, rectification of communes, and literacy campaigns in various regions and units. On the cinema screens, advanced and backward units in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene are also frequently announced. From these progress charts, it can be seen that revolutionary competition between regions and units is constantly driving work forward. After the "Fuyang Daily" announced the fertilizer application progress of each county in Fuyang Prefecture on January 3 this year, nearly half of the wheat field fertilizer application task in the entire Fuyang Prefecture was completed by the 13th. Funan County took the lead in fertilizer application, and other counties strived to catch up. Linquan County, unwilling to lag behind, caught up with Jieshou and Fuyang counties from fifth place and jumped to third place, but was overtaken by Fuyang again midway, and only regained third place on the 13th. Chuxian County was initially the champion in fertilizer accumulation and application in Bengbu Prefecture. However, since the "Fuxiao Daily" announced the progress of fertilizer accumulation and application, the championship was quickly taken away by Quanjiao County. In the five days after this prefecture announced the afforestation progress of each county, the afforestation area reached more than 120,000 mu, creating an unprecedented leap forward speed.

After the Hefei City cinemas announced the list of advanced and backward units in eliminating the four pests on the screen, the advanced units became more active, and the backward units also resolved to double their efforts to do a good job in eliminating the four pests. For example, the eighteen units that were originally relatively backward, such as the Public Security Department, the Health Department, the Hefei Automobile Repair Factory, and the Municipal People's Hospital, have now become advanced units.

    安徽在各项冬季工作中
    推广互相评比的领导方法
    新华社合肥18日电　安徽省在兴修水利中采用的公布各地工程进度、效益，促使各地相互竞赛、评比，推动运动前进的领导方法，现在已经在其他各项冬季工作中普遍推行，并取得良好效果。
    从各地报纸上和区乡的快报、黑板报上，近来不断出现各式各样的进度表，公布各地区、各单位积肥、绿化、田间管理、整社、扫盲等各项工作的进度。在电影院的银幕上，还经常公布除四害、讲卫生的先进单位和落后单位。从这些进度表上，可以看到地区之间、单位之间的革命竞赛不断推动着工作向前猛进。“阜阳报”从今年1月3日公布了阜阳专区各县的追肥进度后，到13日全阜阳专区麦田追肥任务就完成了近一半。阜南县在追肥中一马当先，各县奋起直追。临泉县不甘落后，由名列第五追上了界首、阜阳两县，一跃为第三名，但中途又为阜阳赶过，到13日才重新超过阜阳，保持了第三名。滁县在积肥、追肥工作上一开始是蚌埠专区的冠军，自从“拂晓报”公布积肥、追肥进度以后，很快就被全椒县把冠军夺去了。这个专区在公布各县的绿化进度后的五天中，造林面积就达十二万多亩，创造了空前未有的跃进速度。
    合肥市各电影院在银幕上公布除四害先进和落后单位名单后，使先进单位更加积极，落后单位也决心加倍努力搞好除四害工作，如原来比较落后的公安厅、卫生厅、合肥汽车修理厂、市人民医院等十八个单位，现在都已变成了先进单位。
