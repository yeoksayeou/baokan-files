    The Experience of Experiences
    Tian Xiying
    People greatly admire those advanced regions and advanced agricultural cooperatives that have achieved great leaps forward in production. Everyone wants to know what the experience of these pioneers is. Indeed, each advanced region and advanced cooperative has many good experiences of one kind or another; but they also have a common experience, which is to actively learn and promote the advanced experiences that are most useful to them, regardless of whether these advanced experiences are created by themselves or by others. This can be said to be the experience of experiences.
    Promoting advanced experiences is nothing new, hasn't it been talked about for many years? However, the way it is done is very different: some are very serious, some are half-serious, and some are not serious. Several years of practice have just proven this ordinary experience: the speed of progress of a region and unit depends, to a large extent, on how much labor people have put into promoting advanced experiences.
    Wise and diligent leaders often pay attention to what new practices and experiences have been created in their region and unit, and then seize these good things in their embryonic state, support them, and make them increasingly perfect and rich; at the same time, they actively take various measures to promote and apply these good experiences, so that they can benefit the people in a larger scope. They can also humbly learn from the good experiences of other regions and units, seriously study them in light of the specific conditions of their own region and unit, and actively promote and apply them. In this way, their work can continue to move forward and change with each passing day. On the contrary, if they do not pay attention to summarizing their own good experiences, or if they summarize them but do not work hard to organize their promotion; if they even resist the good experiences of others, find various excuses to prove that others are not advanced, or arbitrarily believe that they are completely inapplicable to their own region and unit, then they will always stand at the level they have already reached, and will no longer be able to take a step forward, or will walk very, very slowly. Today, when everyone is galloping forward like a thoroughbred horse, whoever does not move forward, or moves slowly, will soon find themselves far behind the times. The situation in some counties and agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province is like this. Some areas in other provinces also have this situation.
    Here, the most harmful thing is the conservative and complacent mood of being satisfied with the achievements already made and satisfied with the status quo. People with this kind of mood are very unwilling to often go deep into the revolutionary practice of the broad masses, breathe new air, and discover new things. They always want to avoid seeing new things, especially the new things created by others, or deny their existence. In this way, they can sit quietly in the office and do their work as usual without hurrying. This kind of person either has a decline in revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary will; or has a heart condition and is afraid of running around; or has both.
    Criticizing this conservative and complacent mood and inspiring people's revolutionary enthusiasm is a prerequisite for striving for a great leap forward in work. Promoting new experiences, new technologies, and new methods is indeed much more troublesome than sticking to a set of old rules and old methods. Because this inevitably requires more brainpower, more investigation and research, making plans, organizing mobilization, and mobilizing the masses. These are indeed very tiring to do. However, isn't this what revolutionaries should be like?

    经验中的经验
    田喜盈
    人们都很羡慕那些在生产上实现了大跃进的先进地区和先进农业社。大家都想知道这些先行者的经验是什么。的确，每个先进地区和先进社都有不少的这样或那样的好经验；但是它们也有一条共同的经验，就是积极地学习和推广对自己最有用的先进经验，不管这些先进经验是自己创造的，还是人家的。这可以说是经验中的经验。
    推广先进经验，说来也没有什么新鲜，不是过去已经讲过多年了吗？可是，做起来却大不相同：有的十分认真，有的半认真，有的不认真。几年的实践恰恰证明了这样一条平凡的经验：一个地区和单位的前进速度，在很大程度上取决于人们对于推广先进经验付出了多少劳动。
    明智和勤奋的领导者，经常注意自己地区和单位中创造出来了什么新的作法和经验，然后就抓紧这些萌芽状态的好东西，加以扶植，使它日臻完善和丰富；同时积极采取各种措施来推广应用这些好经验，使它在更大的范围内造福于人民。对于别的地区和单位的好经验，也能够虚心学习，认真地结合本地区本单位的具体条件进行研究，积极地推广应用。这样，他们的工作就能够不断前进，日新月异。反之，如果对于自己的好经验不注意总结，或者总结了而不努力组织推广；对于别人的好经验甚至抱抗拒态度，找出这样那样一些借口来证明人家并不先进，或者武断地认为完全不适用于本地区本单位，那他们就会老是站在已经达到的水平，再也不能走前一步，或者走得非常非常之慢。在大家都像骏马一样一日千里地向前奔驰的今天，谁不往前走，或走慢了，他们很快就会发现自己远远地落到时代后面去了。山西省有些县份和农业社的情形，就是这样。其他省的部分地区，也有这种情形。
    这里，最有害的就是那种满足于既得成绩、满足于现状的保守和自满情绪。有这种情绪的人，他们很不愿意经常深入到广大群众的革命实践中去，呼吸新的空气，发现新的东西。他们对于新的东西，尤其是人家创造的新东西，总是想避免看见，或者否定人家的存在。这样，他们就能够安安静静地坐在办公室里，不慌不忙地照常办公。这种人或者是革命热情和革命意志衰退了；或者是心脏有病，怕跑路；或者二者都有。
    批判这种保守和自满情绪，把人们的革命干劲鼓舞起来，是争取工作大跃进的先决条件。推广新经验、新技术、新办法，比起墨守一套旧规矩、老办法，确实要麻烦得多。因为这免不了要多动脑筋，多调查研究，作规划，组织动员，发动群众。这些，做起来确实是很吃力的。可是，革命者不正应当是这样的么？
