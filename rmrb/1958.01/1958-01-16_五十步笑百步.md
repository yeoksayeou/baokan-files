    Fifty Steps Mocking a Hundred Steps
    Former U.S. President Truman said that the most serious foreign policy mistake committed by the Eisenhower administration was "losing the friendship of our friends in Europe and South America" because "they were not treated very well."
    The U.S. government's implementation of a foreign policy of riding roughshod over other countries has been met with opposition from around the world, which even Truman had to acknowledge. In fact, when Truman was president, the U.S. policy was the same. Truman's criticism of Eisenhower is just a case of fifty steps mocking a hundred steps. However, his status as a former president cannot help but give his criticism a certain "authority."

    五十步笑百步
    美国前总统杜鲁门说，艾森豪威尔政府所犯的最严重的外交政策错误是：“失去我们在欧洲和南美洲的朋友的友谊”，因为“它们没有受到很好的对待”。
    美国政府执行骑在其它国家头上的外交政策，遭受全世界的反对，连杜鲁门都不得不承认了。其实杜鲁门做总统的时候，美国的政策也是一样。杜鲁门对艾森豪威尔的批评，不过是五十步笑百步而已。但是他的前任总统的身份不能不使得他的这种批评具有一定的“权威性”。
