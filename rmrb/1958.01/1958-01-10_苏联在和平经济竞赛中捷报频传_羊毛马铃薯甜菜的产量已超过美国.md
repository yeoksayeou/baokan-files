Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 8th: Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich said at a press conference held here on the 8th that the Soviet Union's production of wool, potatoes, and sugar beets has exceeded that of the United States, both in terms of total output and per capita output. He said that the main task of the Soviet Union's future agricultural development plan is to improve the material welfare of the working people, increase the production of agricultural products, and catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita production of meat, milk, and fats.

Matskevich pointed out that the growth rate of milk and meat production in the Soviet Union in recent years has been much faster than in the United States. He cited as an example that in 1956, the total milk production in the Soviet Union increased by 35% compared to 1953, while the United States only increased by 4.2% during the same period. In 1957, the total milk production in the Soviet Union increased by another 11%, reaching 55 million tons, while the United States only increased by 1%, with a total output of 57.6 million tons; that is to say, the Soviet Union has closely followed the United States in this regard.

In terms of meat production, with the increase in output, the Soviet Union's meat procurement volume in 1957 increased by 14% compared to 1956, while in the first eight months of last year, the output of high-quality meat in the United States not only did not increase, but decreased by 4% compared to the same period in 1956.

Matskevich pointed out that compared with the national average livestock product production indicators, the growth rate of livestock products in some regions of the Soviet Union is much faster. For example, the total number of cattle in the Soviet Union increased by 20% in 1956, while states like Kiev, Volyn, and Ryazan increased by 40%. In terms of milk production, the Soviet Union's milk production increased by 11% last year, while the Latvian Republic increased by 49%. The average milk yield per dairy cow in this republic has also increased rapidly. Before the war, the average milk yield per dairy cow here often remained between 900 and 1,100 kilograms, but in 1957 it increased to 1,853 liters (note: one liter of milk weighs more than one kilogram of milk); state farms reached 2,700 liters.

The minister said that the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture is formulating a plan for future agricultural development. Due to the vast territory of the Soviet Union and the different soil and climate conditions in various regions, the Ministry of Agriculture is now working with local agricultural agencies to determine different scientific agricultural cultivation systems according to the specific conditions of different regions. More than 4,000 scientists and agricultural experts are participating in this work.

    苏联在和平经济竞赛中捷报频传
    羊毛马铃薯甜菜的产量已超过美国
    新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联农业部长马茨凯维奇8日在此间举行的记者招待会上说，苏联的羊毛、马铃薯和甜菜的生产不论在总产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面都已经超过了美国。他说，苏联今后发展农业的计划的主要任务是要增进劳动人民的物质福利，提高农产品产量，并且在肉类、奶类、油脂的按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过美国。
    马茨凯维奇指出，最近几年来苏联的牛奶和肉类产量的增长速度比美国快许多倍。他举例说，1956年苏联的牛奶总产量比1953年增加了35％，而美国在同一时期只增加4.2％。1957年，苏联的牛奶总产量又增加了11％，达到了五千五百万吨，而美国只增加了1％，总产量是五千七百六十万吨；也就是说苏联在这方面已经紧紧跟上了美国。
    在肉类生产方面，随着产量的增加，1957年苏联的肉类收购量比1956年增加了14％，而在去年八个月之内，美国上等肉类的产量不但没有增加，反而比1956年同时期减少了4％。
    马茨凯维奇指出，和全国畜产品平均生产指标比较起来，苏联某些地区的畜产品增长速度还要快得多。例如，苏联的牛的总头数在1956年增加了20％，而像基辅、沃林和梁赞等州就增加了40％。在牛奶产量方面，去年苏联牛奶产量增加了11％，然而拉脱维亚共和国就增加了49％。这个共和国每头奶牛的平均产奶量也增加很快。战前，这里每头奶牛的平均产奶量经常停留在九百到一千一百公斤之间，而到1957年就增加到一千八百五十三公升（按：一公升牛奶比一公斤牛奶重）；国营农场则达到二千七百公升。
    这位部长说，苏联农业部正在制订今后发展农业的计划。由于苏联幅员广大，各地的土壤、气候条件不同，现在农业部正在和各地农业机构一起，按照地区不同的具体条件确定不同的科学的农业耕作制度。参加这一工作的有四千多个科学家和农业专家。
