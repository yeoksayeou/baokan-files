    Reaching for a Higher Level
    Huang Zhi
    The Tang Dynasty poet Wang Zhihuan left us with these lines: "To extend your view a thousand miles, you must ascend another story." Today, when we undertake any task, we should do the same, broadening our horizons, standing taller, and seeing farther. Let our vision become even wider, taking in all the beautiful scenery in every direction. Only by seeing far and seeing much can we make comparisons. Only through comparison can we clearly distinguish between the new and the old, the good and the bad, the fast and the slow, the advanced and the backward. Only through comparison can contradictions be fully exposed, struggles be fully launched, work be advanced more quickly, and thinking be improved more rapidly.
    In winter production, Hubei's Xishui County and other regions organized cadres from various areas to visit advanced regions, allowing everyone to evaluate each other, which yielded great results. Through comparison, learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, and encouraging each other, a tremendous force was formed, preventing the advanced from becoming complacent and pushing the backward to catch up, constantly propelling all work to new heights.
    Recently, significant achievements have been made in winter agricultural production and construction across various regions. However, we must also see the other side of things. This is that precisely because the achievements are so great compared to the past, complacency can easily arise.
    Indeed, this is the case. Hebei convened a representative meeting of socialist agricultural construction activists and simultaneously held a large-scale agricultural exhibition. Some representatives came to the meeting with the attitude of "introducing their own advanced experiences," but after visiting the exhibition and seeing others' even greater achievements, they realized that "there is always a higher mountain." This shows that after achieving significant results, if we do not set even higher goals, we can easily become conservative. Through visits and evaluations, horizons are broadened, and fighting spirit becomes even higher.

    更上一层楼
    黄植
    唐代诗人王之涣留下了这样的诗句：“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”。我们今天作任何一件工作，也应该这样，扩展视野，站得高些，看得远些。眼界开阔再开阔，把四面八方的美景尽收眼底。看得远，看得多，才好相互比较。有了比较，才能够清楚地区别新和旧、好和坏、快和慢、先进和落后。有了比较，矛盾才能充分地暴露，斗争才能充分地展开，工作才能更快地前进，思想才能更快地提高。
    湖北浠水县和其他一些地区在冬季生产中组织各地干部到先进的地区参观，让大家互相评比，收到了很大的效果。经过比较，互相取长补短，互相勉励，就形成了一种巨大的力量，使先进的不自满，落后的往前赶，各种工作都不断推向新的高度。
    最近各地冬季农业生产建设都得到了很大的成绩。但是，我们也要看到事情的另一面。这就是正因为同过去比较成绩很大，也就容易滋长自满情绪。
    事实也正是如此。河北开了一个社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议，同时举办了规模宏大的农业展览会。有些地方的代表抱着“介绍自己的先进经验”的态度来开会，但是，在参观了展览会，看到别人更高的成绩以后，才知道“天外还有天”。足见有了比较大的成绩以后，如果不悬上更高的目标，也就容易保守；经过参观评比，眼界开阔了，斗志就更高了。
