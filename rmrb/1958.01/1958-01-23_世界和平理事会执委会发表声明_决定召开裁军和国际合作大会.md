Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 22nd: The secretariat of the World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie has released the following statement to the press:

    The public knows that the increase in atomic bases, the deployment of ballistic rockets, and the flight of aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs cannot ensure peace. They understand that not the intensification of the arms race, but disarmament, can lead to the easing of international tensions and selfless cooperation between countries.

    Proposals for banning nuclear tests, establishing non-atomic zones, closing military bases, and reducing armed forces are gaining increasing support.

    Every day, the peace forces in various countries are expanding their activities and uniting to take action; this is evidenced by the following examples: the declaration of nine thousand scientists, the position of the working-class movement, the grand demonstrations of the people of Asia and Africa, the resistance in Europe against the establishment of rocket bases, the resistance in Latin America against the expansion of military treaties, and the increasing discussion within the United States about resolving problems through peaceful means.

    More and more governments recognize the urgent need to convene a summit conference, which will give the major powers the opportunity to study all proposals and break the current deadlock.

    Public opinion demands such a conference, and any method of arrangement is acceptable as long as specific dates can be determined. Public opinion fears that indefinite delays may be exploited to accelerate the establishment of atomic forces and further intensify the Cold War. On the other hand, if all forces can be concentrated and mutual distrust eliminated, public opinion can exert its full power and achieve the victory of its will.

    New efforts are needed. The World Peace Council has decided to convene a Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation from July 16th to 22nd, 1958. This conference will provide new impetus to the forces of peace.

    The conference will help to concentrate different views and find their common ground. The conference will study the conditions for achieving the greatest international cooperation, with full respect for national independence, in accordance with the supreme interests of peace and prosperity of all nations.

    The time has come when constantly vigilant public opinion can reverse the trend towards nuclear war.

    世界和平理事会执委会发表声明
    决定召开裁军和国际合作大会
    新华社巴黎22日电　世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的秘书处向报界发表了如下的声明：
    公众知道，原子基地的增加，弹道火箭的配置和载有氢弹飞机的飞行，不能够使和平得到确保。他们懂得，不是加紧武器竞赛，而是裁军才能导致国际紧张局势的缓和与各国之间无私的合作。
    禁止核试验、建立非原子地区、关闭军事基地和裁减武装部队等建议，日益获得更多的支持。
    每天，各国的和平力量都在扩大它们的活动并且团结起来采取行动；这一点由下面这些事例可以得到证明：九千位科学家的声明，工人阶级运动的立场，亚非各国人民的盛大示威，欧洲对设立火箭基地的反抗，拉丁美洲对扩大军事条约的反抗，以及美国国内现在越来越多地讨论用和平方法解决问题。
    越来越多的政府认识到迫切需要召开最高级会议，这将使各大国有机会来研究一切建议并打开目前的僵局。
    舆论要求举行这种会议，只要能确定具体的日期，不论用什么办法来进行安排都可以。舆论担心无限期地拖延下去会有可能被人利用来加速设立原子部队和进一步加剧冷战。另一方面，如果能集中一切力量并且消除相互间的不信任，那么舆论是能够发挥它的全部力量并取得自己意志的胜利的。
    需要作新的努力。世界和平理事会已经决定在1958年7月16日到22日召开一次裁军和国际合作大会。这次大会将给和平力量提供新的推动力。
    大会将帮助把不同的见解集中起来找出它们的共同之处。大会将根据各国人民的和平与繁荣的最高利益，来研究在充分尊重民族独立的情况下争取国际间最大的合作的条件。
    时刻警惕着的舆论能够扭转走向核战争的趋向的时候已经到来了。
    世界和平理事会执行委员会
