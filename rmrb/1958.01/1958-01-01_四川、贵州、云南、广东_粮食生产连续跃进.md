Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong
Continuous Leap Forward in Grain Production

    (Our report) During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, China's agricultural production achieved great success. One of the main achievements is the new situation of straight upward and continuous leap forward in grain production in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces. The total grain output of these four provinces increased from 66.79 billion jin in 1952 to 93.65 billion jin in 1957, an increase of more than 26.8 billion jin, accounting for 43.8% of the total increase in national grain production (61.2 billion jin) during the same period. That is, the output in 1957 increased by 40.2% compared with 1952, with an average annual increase rate of 7%, which is more than twice as fast as the national average growth rate. If the development speed of all provinces (regions) in the country were as fast as these four provinces, then the total national grain output in 1957 would be more than 432.9 billion jin instead of 370 billion jin, 606.9 billion jin in 1962, and 849.9 billion jin in 1967.
    In February last year, Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui pointed out in his report at the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives: If we develop to 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin according to the Forty Articles Program in twelve years, then by 1967 our total grain output will reach more than 750 billion jin, and with some land reclamation, the total output can reach more than 800 billion jin. That is to say, if all provinces (regions) in the country develop according to the speed of these four provinces, the "four, five, eight" indicators can be overfulfilled.
    The four provinces have a total cultivated land area of about 250 million mu, accounting for about 14.7% of the country. It is estimated that they will produce 93.65 billion jin of grain in 1957, accounting for 25.3% of the country's total grain output of 370 billion jin.
    It is worth noting that the natural conditions in these four provinces are not very good. Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," has mostly hills and mountains, except for the millions of mu of fertile land in the Chengdu Plain. There are fifty large mountainous counties on the edge, accounting for 25% of the province's cultivated land area. In Guizhou Province, less than one-third of the cultivated land is flat, and two-thirds are slopes. Transportation is inconvenient, and the economy is backward. It has always been known as a barren area with "no three li of flat land, no three days of sunshine, and no three fen of silver for the people." In Yunnan Province, mountain cultivated land also accounts for more than 60%, mostly distributed on plateaus above 2,000 meters above sea level. Although Guangdong Province has a better climate, it has still suffered from spring droughts, autumn droughts, typhoons, floods, etc. in recent years. The continuous leap forward in grain production is mainly due to the vigorous implementation of various production increase measures on the basis of cooperativization in the past few years. A large number of farmland water conservancy projects have been built. A large amount of farm manure has been added. The multiple cropping index of cultivated land has been greatly increased, and the cultivation system has been changed. Attention has been paid to expanding the planting of high-yield crops. On the basis of expanding water conservancy irrigation and increasing the sown area, the four provinces have expanded the rice area by more than 18.8 million mu and increased the sweet potato planting area by more than 11 million mu in the past five years. These high-yield crops were expanded on the basis of increasing the multiple cropping index, which did not affect the increase in production of other crops. These two items alone can increase grain production by about 8 billion jin per year. Sweet potatoes are high-yield crops in all regions of the country and are extremely adaptable, but some provinces (regions) do not have enough planting area.
    In addition, the four provinces have also promoted soil improvement, water and soil conservation, advanced cultivation techniques, improved varieties, and new agricultural tools according to local conditions. These are all factors for rapid production growth.
    From the grain growth rate of these four provinces, it can be seen that as long as we strengthen leadership, grasp the main key to increasing production, and mobilize the masses to vigorously implement it, agricultural production will surely make a great leap forward.

    四川、贵州、云南、广东
    粮食生产连续跃进
    本报讯　在第一个五年计划期间，我国农业生产取得了伟大的成就。其中主要成就之一，就是四川、贵州、云南、广东四省的粮食生产呈现了直线上升、连续跃进的新情况。这四个省粮食总产量由1952年的六百六十七点九亿斤，逐年递增到1957年的九百三十六点五亿斤，增长了二百六十八亿斤以上，占同时期全国粮食增产总数（六百一十二亿斤）的43.8％。即1957年比1952年增产了40.2％，平均每年递增速度为7％，比全国平均增长速度快一倍以上。如果全国各省（区）都像这四个省的发展速度这样快，那么全国粮食总产量1957年便不止三千七百亿斤而是四千三百二十九亿斤，1962年便是六千零六十九亿斤，1967年便是八千四百九十九亿斤。
    去年2月，国务院副总理邓子恢同志在全国农业劳动模范代表会议上报告中指出：如果我们在十二年内按照四十条纲要发展到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的话，那么到1967年我们的粮食总产量将达到七千五百多亿斤，加上部分开荒，总产量可达到八千多亿斤。这就是说，如果全国各省（区）都按照这四个省的速度发展，“四、五、八”的指标便可以超额完成了。
    四个省共有耕地面积二亿五千万亩左右，约占全国14.7％，1957年预计产粮食九百三十六点五亿斤，占全国粮食总产量三千七百亿斤的25.3％。
    值得注意的问题是这四省自然条件并不算很好。号称“天府之国”的四川，除去成都平原的数百万亩沃野而外，绝大部分耕地都是丘陵和山区。边缘的大山区县就有五十个，耕地面积占全省25％。贵州省平坦的耕地不到三分之一，三分之二都是坡地，交通不便，经济落后，是向来被称为“地无三里平，天无三日晴，人无三分银”的贫瘠地区。云南省山区的耕地也占60％以上，大都分布在拔海二千公尺以上的高原。广东省虽然气候较好，连年来仍然遭受到春旱、秋旱、台风、洪水等的袭击。粮食产量的连续跃进主要是由于他们几年来在合作化的基础上大力推行了各项增产措施的结果。大量兴修了农田水利。大量增加了农家肥料。大大提高了耕地复种指数和改变了耕作制度。注意扩种了高产作物。在扩大水利灌溉和增加播种面积的基础上，四省五年来共扩大了水稻面积一千八百八十多万亩，增加了薯类播种面积一千一百多万亩。这些高产作物是在提高复种指数的基础上扩种的，并不影响其它作物的增产，单此两项每年便可增产粮食八十亿斤左右。薯类在全国各地区都是高产作物，适应性极大，但有些省（区）种植面积还不够多。
    此外，四省还因地制宜的推行了土壤改良、水土保持、推广了先进栽培技术、优良品种、新式农具等等。都是生产迅速增长的因素。
    从这四个省的粮食增长速度可以看出，只要加强领导，抓住增产的主要关键，发动群众大力贯彻，农业生产一定可以大跃进。
