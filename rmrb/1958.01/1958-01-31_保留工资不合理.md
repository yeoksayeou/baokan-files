    Retaining salaries for former personnel left over from the reactionary government was necessary and correct in the early days of liberation. This allowed them to work with peace of mind. However, after eight or nine years of liberation, it is no longer necessary to retain this system. Especially after the wage reform, at a time when the entire nation is diligently building a socialist motherland, it is simply harmful and useless.
    Everyone knows that the retained salary system is not in line with the socialist principle of "distribution according to work." Many people who enjoy this benefit do indeed feel the care of the Party and the state, and are able to serve the people well; and after their awareness has been raised, they feel ashamed and are unwilling to continue receiving it. However, there are also many people who enjoy this benefit who continue to live a decadent bourgeois life of extravagance and dissipation, and do not work hard. If such people are still given retained salaries, it will objectively promote their capitalist ideology.
    If this system is not abolished, it will also increase contradictions among the people. Because the lives of those who enjoy high salaries and retained wages are far from the living standards of the working people. Moreover, because it is not in line with the principle of "distribution according to work," it will inevitably affect the work enthusiasm of other staff. As for the fact that the retained salary system costs the country a considerable amount of funds every year, that goes without saying.
    It is time to abolish the retained salary system.

### 保留工资不合理

    保留工资不合理
    解放初期，对反动政府遗留下来的旧人员采取保留工资的办法是必要和正确的。这样，可以使他们安心工作。但是，解放八、九年了，再保留这个制度实在没有必要。特别是在工资改革以后，在全国人民勤俭建设社会主义祖国的今天，简直是有害无益了。
    谁都知道，保留工资制度是不符合社会主义“按劳取酬”的分配原则的。不少享受这一待遇的人，的确从中体会到党和国家的照顾，能好好为人民服务；而且在觉悟提高以后，感到问心有愧，不愿再拿下去了。但也有不少享受这一待遇的人，依旧花天酒地，过着资产阶级的腐朽生活，不好好工作。如果还给这样的人保留工资，客观上就助长他们的资本主义思想。
    如果不取消这一制度，还会增加人民内部的矛盾。因为享受高薪保留工资的人的生活，跟劳动人民的生活水平比起来，相差很远。而且，由于不符合“按劳取酬”的原则，必然会影响其他工作人员的工作积极性。至于因保留工资制度，每年要耗费国家相当一部分资金，那是不待言的了。
    是取消保留工资的时候了。
                （王坚强、张加模）
