    Increased Sugarcane Production
    (Our dispatch) Currently, we are entering the peak sugarcane harvest season. The total national output is expected to increase by 18% compared to 1956. Compared with the highest pre-war year (1940), the increase is more than 80%. Guangdong, Yunnan, and Fujian have significantly increased production compared to 1956, while other provinces have seen slight increases; a few provinces have experienced slight decreases.
    The reasons for the increased sugarcane production are primarily the widespread adoption of improved sugarcane varieties, which nearly doubled in 1957 compared to 1956. Regions like Sichuan and Guangdong, which started earlier, have already reached two-thirds or one-half of their cultivated area with improved varieties; improved sugarcane varieties such as "Taiwan Sugar 134" are receiving increasingly widespread acclaim from sugarcane farmers in various regions. According to a survey in Fujian, the yield increase rate of improved varieties generally reaches 20%-30%, and can be as high as 70%-80% with high-yield cultivation. Secondly, dryland sugarcane planting has also seen increased production. The sugarcane in the Glorious Agricultural Cooperative and Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Neijiang, Sichuan, is not only planted in dryland but also on shallow hilly land; it has not only achieved high yields but also achieved high yields on a large scale (the Glorious Cooperative has more than 1,500 mu of sugarcane land, with an average yield of 10,144 jin per mu); not only is the yield of newly planted sugarcane high, but the yield of ratooned sugarcane is even higher. This powerfully refutes the conservative idea that "dryland sugarcane is difficult to produce at high yields." (Zheng Deqing)

### 甘蔗增产

    甘蔗增产
    本报讯　目前已进入甘蔗收获盛期。预计全国总产量可比1956年增加18％。和战前最高年（1940年）产量相比，增加了八成以上。广东、云南、福建比1956年增产较多，其它各省稍有超过；个别省则稍有减产。
    甘蔗得到增产的原因，首先是普及甘蔗良种，1957年比1956年增加了将近一倍。四川、广东等动手较早的地区，良种面积已达到栽培面积的二分之一或三分之一；“台糖134”等甘蔗良种，受到各地蔗农愈来愈广泛的欢迎。据福建调查：良种增产率，一般达20％—30％，丰产栽培的则高达70％—80％。其次，旱地种植甘蔗也得了增产。四川内江光荣农业社、顺江农业社的甘蔗，不仅是种在旱地上，而且是种在土层浅薄的丘陵地上；不仅是取得了丰产，而且是取得了大面积的丰产（光荣社一千五百多亩蔗土，每亩平均产一万零一百四十四斤）；不仅新植蔗产量高，而且宿根蔗产量更高。这就有力地否定了“旱地甘蔗难丰产”的保守思想。　（郑德庆）
