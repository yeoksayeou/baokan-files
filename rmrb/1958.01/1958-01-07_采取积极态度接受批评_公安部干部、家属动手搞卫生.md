Adopting a Positive Attitude to Accept Criticism
Cadres and Families of the Ministry of Public Security Take Action to Improve Sanitation

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Public Security has adopted a positive attitude in accepting the Beijing Daily's criticism of their lack of attention to sanitation. Starting from December 27th of last year, they mobilized cadres, workers, and their families to take action together, launching a mass sanitation campaign that has given a completely new look to the sanitation of all departments under its jurisdiction.

After the Beijing Daily exposed on December 27th of last year that the Ministry of Public Security "did not clean at all" during the "eliminate four pests, promote hygiene" campaign week, and that "indoor and environmental sanitation conditions were very poor," it immediately attracted the attention of the leaders of the Ministry of Public Security. Wang Zhao, Vice Minister of Public Security, immediately inspected the sanitation conditions in various places with the person in charge of the Ministry's Bureau of Government Offices Administration after seeing the newspaper, and studied ways to improve the situation. The CCP Committee of the Ministry of Public Security also posted big-character posters in a timely manner, calling on responsible cadres in each department to take the lead, with all personnel working together to change the backward situation in sanitation and catch up with advanced units. Starting from that afternoon until the 29th, the Ministry of Public Security headquarters and all directly affiliated units, including the Public Security Hospital and nurseries, universally carried out a major clean-up. Now, many offices and dormitories in the Ministry have truly achieved "bright windows and clean desks, free from dust." Many courtyards have been swept clean.

On January 2nd, the Bureau of Government Offices Administration of the Ministry of Public Security convened a meeting of responsible administrative cadres from various departments. It was pointed out that although the major clean-up had achieved great results, some offices and dormitories had not cleaned the doorknobs, the seams of heating pipes, and the corridors thoroughly enough, or had not cleaned at all; in the dormitories of individual cadres who had been transferred to lower levels or engaged in production, due to the age of their family members or the lack of action by their domestic helpers, cleaning had not been carried out; and individual public places had become "no-man's lands" due to unclear division of responsibilities. The meeting requested that each department must thoroughly clean the areas that had not been cleaned thoroughly, provide appropriate assistance to families with difficulties, and further mobilize the masses who had not been mobilized, so that the sanitation work of each department can be universal, thorough, and sustained through this campaign.

    采取积极态度接受批评
    公安部干部、家属动手搞卫生
    据新华社讯　公安部以积极态度接受北京日报对他们不重视卫生工作的批评，从去年12月27日起，发动干部、工人和家属们一齐动手，展开了一个群众性的卫生运动，使得所属各部门的卫生面貌为之一新。
    北京日报在去年12月27日揭露了公安部在除四害、讲卫生的突击周中，“根本没有打扫，室内卫生和环境卫生状况很糟”的消息后，立即引起公安部领导上的重视。公安部副部长王昭看到报纸后，马上偕同部里机关事务管理局负责人巡视了各处卫生情况，研究改进办法。中共公安部党委会也及时贴出大字报，号召各部门负责干部带头，全体人员一起动手，改变卫生方面的落后情况，赶上先进单位。就从这天下午开始到29日，公安部本部和各直属单位，包括公安医院和托儿所在内，普遍进行了一次大扫除。现在，这个部的许多办公室和宿舍真正做到了“窗明几净、尘土不染”。许多院落里打扫得干干净净。
    1月2日，公安部机关事务管理局召开各部门行政工作负责干部会议。指出这次大扫除虽然成绩很大，但还有部分办公室和宿舍对门把手、暖气管缝里和走廊上打扫得不够干净，或没有打扫；个别下放或生产干部的宿舍里，因家属年老或保姆未行动起来，还没有打扫；个别公共场所因分工负责不够明确，成了“三不管”地。会上要求各部门对打扫得不够彻底的地方一定要打扫彻底，对有困难的家属要给予适当帮助，对没有动员起来的群众要进一步动员，使各部门的卫生工作通过这次运动后，能做到普遍、彻底和坚持下去。
