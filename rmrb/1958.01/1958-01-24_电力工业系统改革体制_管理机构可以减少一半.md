    Reform of the Electric Power Industry System
    Management Institutions Can Be Reduced by Half
    (This report) According to the State Council's regulations on improving the industrial management system, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has formulated a reform plan for the electric power industry system, which has been approved by the State Council and will be implemented starting in January.
    With the implementation of this plan, the management institutions of the production system under the Ministry of Electric Power Industry can be streamlined by about half. After the abolition of the regional electric power administrations, the structure from the Ministry to power plants, power supply bureaus, and other direct production units will be changed from four levels to three levels.
    The plan stipulates that fifteen provincial (municipal, autonomous region) electric power bureaus, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia, as well as one train electric power bureau, will be established according to the establishment of power systems and provinces. In the future, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry will manage a total of seventy-seven state-owned power plants, with an installed capacity of approximately three million kilowatts, and nineteen large and small power grids. Twenty-one power plants in Fujian, Xinjiang, and areas such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Jiangsu that are not connected to the power grid will be handed over to local governments for management. The total power generation capacity of these power plants is about 230,000 kilowatts, equivalent to half of the total power generation capacity of local power plants nationwide in 1957. Most of them are distributed in small and medium-sized cities, and some are in remote areas. After being directly managed by local governments, they will be able to receive more leadership from local Party and government organs.
    In the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's system reform plan, specific measures have also been proposed for appropriately merging basic construction management institutions of the electric power industry and improving the internal division of labor in the basic construction work of the electric power industry system.
    In order to appropriately expand the authority of enterprises, in addition to delegating some personnel, financial, and planning authority last year, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry is currently drafting detailed methods for dividing labor and management authority between the Ministry and the bureaus, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's regulations.

    电力工业系统改革体制
    管理机构可以减少一半
    本报讯　电力工业部根据国务院关于改进工业管理体制的规定订出的电力工业体制改革方案，已经国务院批准，从1月份开始实行。
    实行这一方案，电力工业部所属生产系统的管理机构约可精简一半；撤消地区电业管理局以后，由部到发电厂、供电局等直接生产单位，由过去的四级改为三级。
    方案中确定，按电力系统和省的建制设立黑龙江、辽宁、河北、河南、山西、山东、陕西、甘肃、湖北、湖南、广东、四川、北京、上海、内蒙古等十五个省（市、自治区）电业局及一个列车电业局。今后电力工业部管理的国营发电厂共有七十七个，设备容量约三百万瓩；大小电力网十九个。福建、新疆以及黑龙江、吉林、江苏等地没有纳入电力网的二十一个发电厂，交给地方政府管理。这些电厂发电能力的总和约二十三万瓩，相当于1957年全国地方电厂总发电能力的一半。它们大都分布在中小城市，有的在边远地区，由地方政府直接管理以后，能够更多地接受地方党政机关的领导。
    电力工业部的体制改革方案中，对于适当合并电力工业基本建设管理机构、改善电力工业系统基本建设工作的内部分工等方面，也提出了具体措施。
    为了适当扩大企业权限，电力工业部除在去年下放了一部分人权、财权、计划权以外，现正按照国务院规定的精神，拟定详细的部、局分工和管理权限划分办法。
