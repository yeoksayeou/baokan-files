    Starting from the Life of a Colonel
    There is an Air Force colonel who is an old depositor at our savings office. Once, I happened to visit his home on business, and I was very moved by the frugality of his family.
    Besides two wooden beds and a few simple, rough wooden furniture, there was almost no decoration in their house. The most interesting thing was his tea set for guests, which turned out to be a chipped porcelain teapot and four small rice bowls of different styles and sizes. The colonel told us that the teacups were all broken, so he bought this bowl for the New Year, which could be used for both eating and drinking tea. During the conversation, I learned that the colonel and his wife had a monthly salary of more than 300 yuan and seven children. He had his parents and a younger sister in his hometown. His parents were old and had no labor force, and he had to send them 200 yuan every year. Since the colonel entered the city in 1949, he had not made any clothes except for a leather overcoat in 1950 during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea because of the cold weather in the Northeast. His single military uniform was worn inside and out, and the broken ones could not even be used as shoe soles. He pointed to the worn-out woolen jacket he was wearing, saying, "I dyed my old military uniform to wear it. This material is so good, even if it's torn, it's still very good clothes after being patched up." He picked up a small enamel bowl with a lot of porcelain chipped off and said, "In Shandong in 1944, my drinking bowl was crushed. The orderly gave me this war trophy to use, and I still use it for rinsing my mouth now. Our soap dish has been broken by the children for more than two years, but it can still be used after being glued together, so we didn't buy a new one. All utensils, as long as they can be used, are fine. Our current life is not only vastly different from before liberation, but also much higher than that of the peasants!"
    Since entering the city after liberation, the colonel has insisted on saving money every month. Last year, he bought 150 yuan of government bonds and donated 150 yuan. He not only saves himself but also often encourages his comrades around him to save and deposit money.
    Perhaps some people may wonder: This colonel has a lot of savings in the bank, so why doesn't he make a few new clothes and buy a few new teacups?
    The colonel's answer is very clear: "National construction needs money, and everyone should be as frugal as possible, which is good for the country and for themselves." Then, he said to me: Arranging family life is not enough to just "avoid wasting," but should also be as frugal as possible.
    I will never forget everything I saw and heard at the colonel's home, so I wrote it down, hoping that everyone can arrange their lives based on the principle of frugality. Zhang Geqian, Dongdan District Savings Office, People's Bank of Beijing

    从一位上校的生活谈起
    有一位空军上校，他是我们储蓄所的老储户。有一回，我偶尔有事到他家里去拜访，看到他家那种节俭情况，很使我感动。
    他们屋里除了两张木床和几件简单的粗木家具以外，几乎没有什么陈设。最有趣的是他待客用的茶具，原来是一只破了嘴的瓷茶壶和四个式样、大小各不相同的小饭碗。上校告诉我们，茶碗都坏了，过年买的这碗，既能吃饭，又能喝茶。谈话中，我了解到，上校夫妇每月薪金三百余元，有七个孩子。老家有父、母和妹妹，父母年老无劳动力，每年要寄去二百元。上校自从1949年进城以来，除了1950年抗美援朝时因东北天气冷做一件皮大衣外，没有做过衣服。单军服是外面穿了里面套，破的没法做鞋底。他指着身上穿的破了袖口的军呢上身说：“我把旧军装染了穿。这材料多好啊，破了缝缝，还是很好的衣服。”他拿起一个掉了很多瓷的小搪瓷碗说，“1944年在山东，我的喝水碗被压坏了。通讯员把这个战利品给我用，到现在我还用它漱口呢。我们的肥皂盒，被孩子摔破已经二年多了，粘上还可以用，也就没买。一切用具，只要能用就行了。我们现在的生活不但和解放前有天地之别，比起农民来也高的多啊！”
    上校自解放进城以来，坚持月月储蓄。去年买了一百五十元公债，还捐献一百五十元。他不仅自己节约，也常劝导周围的同志们节约储蓄。
    也许有人会想：这位上校在银行有不少存款，为什么不做几套新衣服，买几个新茶碗呢？
    上校的回答很明确：“国家建设需要钱，每个人尽量节俭些，对国家、对自己都有好处”。接着，他对我说：安排家庭生活，仅做到“不浪费”是不够的，还应该尽量的节俭。
    我永远不会忘记在上校家里看到和听到的一切，所以我写了出来，希望大家都能本着节俭的原则安排自己的生活。北京人民银行东单区储蓄处　张戈千
