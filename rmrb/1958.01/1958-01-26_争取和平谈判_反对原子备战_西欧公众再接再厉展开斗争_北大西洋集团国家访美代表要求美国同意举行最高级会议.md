Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Reports from various sources indicate that movements demanding an East-West summit and opposing the atomic arms race are further unfolding in Western European countries.

The British Peace Committee submitted a six-point peace plan to the British Parliament on the evening of the 23rd. This plan calls for Britain to prohibit U.S. aircraft carrying nuclear weapons from patrolling British airspace, to cancel the agreement to set up nuclear rockets in Britain, to immediately stop British nuclear weapons testing, to stop all nuclear weapons testing through a summit conference, to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and to sign an agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons, missiles, conventional weapons, and armies.

On the same day, a mass rally was held in central London to support the British Peace Committee's demands in its letter to Parliament to eliminate the threat of atomic war.

Prior to the mass meeting, participants held a march, chanting slogans and distributing leaflets calling for high-level negotiations, a halt to nuclear weapons testing, the abandonment of plans to build rocket bases in Scotland, and a ban on U.S. aircraft carrying atomic weapons from flying over British airspace.

In France, the Paris branch of the National Union of Secondary School Teachers passed a resolution at its recent congress, resolutely opposing the establishment of destructive rocket launching pads in France and any other country in the world, and demanding the removal of any launching pads that may have already been built. The resolution also called on the French government to take the initiative in promoting East-West negotiations in order to take preliminary measures to reduce armaments and to formulate plans to establish a Central European non-atomic weapons zone.

In the Côte d'Azur region, where the U.S. Sixth Fleet, equipped with atomic bombs, is stationed, seventeen well-known figures from Antibes, including Social Party member and First Deputy Mayor of Antibes, Corvee, called for a peaceful resolution of issues between East and West. They pointed out that setting up nuclear missile launching pads creates new factors for international tension.

City councilors from the Communist, Socialist, Popular Republican, and Independent parties in the town of Ligamarie in the department of Loir-et-Cher unanimously expressed their opposition to the establishment of launching pads on French territory. The city council of Saint-Pierre-des-Corps in the department of Indre-et-Loire made a similar protest.

In Italy, parliamentarians from the Apulia, Sardinia, and Padua regions, where U.S. rocket launching bases are planned to be built, recently held a gathering in Rome. The meeting decided to establish contact with councilors from various provinces and cities and mayors to support any initiative aimed at maintaining peace.

The city council of San Nicandro Garganico (Foggia province) unanimously passed a resolution calling on the government to pursue a policy of "atomic neutrality" and to refuse to establish U.S. rocket bases on Italian territory.

Recently, mass rallies protesting the establishment of U.S. rocket bases in Italy have been held in Ancona, Naples, Genoa, Milan, Turin, Florence, Padua, Bologna, and other places.

According to a Washington report: Most of the representatives of the ten NATO countries who were invited by the U.S. government to visit military facilities in the United States, requested Eisenhower on the 23rd to accept Bulganin's proposal for a summit conference.

Danish representative Norman, reflecting the majority opinion, said: "We believe that the United States is wrong not to accept Russia's invitation to negotiate. We feel that all possibilities for peace should be explored."

Only the representatives of France and Italy disagreed with this view.

    争取和平谈判　反对原子备战
    西欧公众再接再厉展开斗争
    北大西洋集团国家访美代表要求美国同意举行最高级会议
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：要求举行东西方最高级会议和反对原子备战政策运动正在西欧国家进一步展开。
    英国和平委员会在23日晚间向英国议会提出六点和平计划。这项计划要求英国禁止带核武器的美国飞机在英国上空巡逻，取消在英国设置核火箭的协定，立刻停止英国的核武器试验，通过最高级会议来停止一切核武器试验，在中欧建立无核武器地区，签订裁除核武器、导弹、常规武器和军队的协定。
    同一天，伦敦中心举行群众集会，支持英国和平委员会在给议会的信中提出的消除原子战争威胁的要求。
    在群众大会以前，参加大会的人举行了游行，他们齐声高呼口号，并且散发传单，要求举行高级谈判、停止核武器试验、放弃在苏格兰建立火箭基地的计划、禁止载着原子武器的美国飞机在英国上空飞行。
    在法国，全国中等教师工会巴黎分会在最近举行的代表大会上通过一项决议，坚决反对在法国和在世界上任何其他国家设置毁灭性的火箭发射台，要求撤除可能已经建立的发射台。决议并且要求法国政府采取主动促成东西方谈判，以便采取裁减军备的初步措施和拟定建立中欧非原子武器区的计划。
    在装备着原子弹的美国第六舰队停泊的蓝色海岸地区，包括社会党人翁提布市第一副市长科维在内的翁提布市十七个知名人士要求和平解决东西方之间的问题。他们指出，设置核导弹发射台是为国际紧张局势制造新的因素。
    罗亚尔省里加玛里市的共产党、社会党、人民共和党和独立党的市议员们一致表示反对在法国领土上设置发射台。昂德尔罗亚尔省圣皮埃尔戈尔市议会提出了类似的抗议。
    在意大利，准备建立美国火箭发射基地的阿浦利亚、撒丁岛和巴图亚等地区的议员最近在罗马举行了集会，会上决定同各省市议会议员及各市长建立接触，支持任何以维护和平为目的的倡议。
    圣尼坎德罗（福查省）市议会一致通过了一个决议，要求政府执行“原子中立”政策，拒绝在意大利领土上建立美国火箭基地。
    最近，在安科纳、那布勒斯、热那亚、米兰、都灵、佛罗伦萨、巴图亚、波伦亚等地方都举行了抗议在意大利建立美国火箭基地的群众集会。
    另据华盛顿消息：应美国政府邀请在美国参观军事设施的北大西洋公约组织的十个国家的代表中的多数成员，23日要求艾森豪威尔接受布尔加宁的关于举行高级会议的建议。
    反映多数意见的丹麦代表诺曼说：“我们认为美国不接受俄国的谈判邀请是不对的。我们觉得应当试探争取和平的一切可能性。”
    只有法国和意大利的代表不同意这种意见。
