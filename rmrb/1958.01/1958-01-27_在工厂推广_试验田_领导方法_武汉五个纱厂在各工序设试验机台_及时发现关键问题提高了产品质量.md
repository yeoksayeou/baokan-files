Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 25th. Today, the Hubei Daily published on its front page as the top headline news that the leading cadres of five cotton mills in Wuhan have learned from the leadership methods of rural cadres in Hubei Province in cultivating experimental plots and have been piloting "one-dragon" measures in workshops since January.

"One-dragon" means that from the first process to the last process of production, key experimental machines are designated, and the secretary and deputy secretaries of the Party Committee, members of the Party Committee, managers and deputy managers (factory directors), chief engineers, and chairmen of the trade unions of each factory go deep into the workshops to rely on workshop technicians and veteran workers to improve technology, improve operating methods, create advanced indicators, and summarize experience based on the production situation of the experimental machines for comprehensive promotion. This "one-dragon" measure was previously adopted by some cotton mills when changing product varieties or replacing machines. Since learning the leadership method of rural cadres in cultivating experimental plots, each cotton mill decided to make the "one-dragon" measure a regular practice and to have leading cadres personally manage the experimental machines in the "one-dragon" process.

Since the cotton mills have adopted the "one-dragon" measure for key experiments, they have achieved preliminary results in discovering and solving key production problems and improving product quality. Ge Ming, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill, after going deep into the South Plant's spinning workshop, heard that the machine operators were afraid of three things: "afraid of changing leather rollers, afraid of washing the machines, and afraid of leveling the machines." He immediately consulted with the maintenance workers and solved the problem in a day or two. Subsequently, the cotton waste rate of the machine operator Gao Dongyun decreased significantly, reaching the advanced level in Wuhan. Hu Boqin, manager of the No. 1 Cotton Mill, discovered air leaks in the steel wire carding machine door in the South Plant's spinning workshop and immediately organized repairs, resolving the problem in less than an hour. Thanks to the joint efforts of leading cadres and the masses of workers, the South Plant's spinning workshop of the No. 1 Cotton Mill, focusing on improving quality and reducing end breakage, changed the spacing of the machines and the specifications of the spindles and cots. The experimental results have been very effective and are waiting for technical conclusions to be drawn before comprehensive promotion can be organized.

The state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, Wuchang Yuhua Cotton Mill, and Hankou Shenxin Cotton Mill have also achieved some results in piloting the "one-dragon" measure.

The Party Committee of Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill believes that in the past, leading cadres only superficially inspected the workshops, and leadership in production was characterized by subjectivism and bureaucracy. After piloting the "one-dragon" measure, they have their own "base" and can truly delve into the work.

    在工厂推广“试验田”领导方法
    武汉五个纱厂在各工序设试验机台
    及时发现关键问题提高了产品质量
    新华社武汉25日电　湖北日报今天以第一版头条新闻地位，报道了武汉市五个纱厂的领导干部，学习湖北农村干部搞试验田的领导方法，从1月份起在车间里试行“一条龙”措施的情况。
    “一条龙”就是从生产的头一道工序到末尾一道工序，规定出重点试验机台，由各厂中共党委正副书记、党委委员、正副经理（厂长）、总工程师、工会主席分别深入到各个车间，依靠车间技术人员和老工人，根据试验机台的生产情况，改进技术，改进操作方法，创造先进指标，总结经验，全面推广。这种“一条龙”的措施，过去有些纱厂在改变产品品种、更换机台时曾经采用过，自从学习了农村干部搞试验田的领导方法以后，各纱厂决定把“一条龙”的措施经常化，并且由领导干部亲自掌握“一条龙”中的试验机台。
    各纱厂采用“一条龙”措施进行重点试验以来，在发现和解决生产关键问题、提高产品质量方面，都已获得初步效果。中共武昌第一纱厂委员会副书记葛明深入到厂的南场后纺车间以后，听到值车工有三怕，“怕换皮辊、怕洗车、怕平车”，他立即找保养工研究，一、两天工夫就把这个问题解决了。接着，值车工高冬云的回花率就显著下降，达到了武汉市的先进水平。第一纱厂经理胡伯琴在南场前纺车间发现钢丝抄针门漏气，立即组织检修，不到一个钟头就把问题解决了。由于领导干部和职工群众的共同努力，第一纱厂南场后纺车间围绕提高质量、降低断头率的关键，改变了机台的隔距、肖子和皮圈的规格，试验结果收效很大，只等做出技术结论，便可组织全面推广。
    国营武汉第一棉纺织厂、震寰纱厂、武昌裕华纱厂和汉口申新纱厂，试行“一条龙”的措施也都取得了一些成效。
    中共武昌第一纱厂委员会认为，过去领导干部深入车间只是走马看花，领导生产有主观主义和官僚主义，试行“一条龙”措施以后，自己有了“根据地”，就能真正钻进去了。
