Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The tide of demanding an East-West summit and opposing the establishment of American rocket bases continues to rise in Britain.

The British "Daily Worker" published a statement by the British Communist Party's Political Committee on the 25th, emphasizing the urgent need for the labor movement and the peace movement to make significant efforts to force the government to accept the proposal for an East-West summit.

The statement pointed out that Britain becoming a missile launch site for the United States would make it a prime target for rockets in a future war. It said: "Britain's life and death should not depend on a foreign country. Britain should break free from American control."

The statement called on the people to make their utmost efforts to ensure that those who obstruct negotiations are decisively defeated. It asked everyone to start preparing now for demonstrations at American bases on March 1st. These demonstrations will raise the following demands: close these bases, oppose the construction of rocket launch sites, and withdraw American troops back to the United States.

British Labor Party leader Hugh Gaitskell, in a televised broadcast in London on the evening of the 26th, again called for an East-West "summit" meeting.

He said that the West believes that such talks are only suitable after a long period of preparation, but "I now think that the Russians are considering holding a summit meeting to break the deadlock." At the same time, Gaitskell believes that the preparations for the talks should determine "where the talks will be held, when they will be held, who will participate, and what we will discuss." Gaitskell also said that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Central Europe and the establishment of a neutral zone there would help restore German unity.

Under the initiative of the British "Daily Worker," a mass meeting opposing the establishment of rocket bases was held in Glasgow, Scotland, on the evening of the 26th. Reports say that American rocket bases will be established here.

British famous peace advocate, the Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, said at the meeting that American government officials are afraid of peace because peace will pave the way for disarmament and bankrupt the war industry. On the other hand, they are afraid of wars they cannot win, so they have to resort to the third method, which is the threat of war.

He said: The Soviet Union, while making every progress, does not boast or threaten, but puts forward new peace proposals, "Can we, who call ourselves the Christian West, reject those proposals?"

The British Co-operative Party's "Reynolds News" demanded on the 26th that Britain play a leading role in the struggle to win international mutual understanding. It said: "Regardless of whether the United States participates, Britain should take the lead in urging summit talks."

The newspaper pointed out that Labor Party members should use all their influence to urge the British government to take action.

    英国政界要求谈判呼声日高
    英共号召人民迫使政府接受苏联建议
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：要求举行东西方最高级会议和反对建立美国火箭基地的浪潮，仍在英国继续高涨中。
    英国“工人日报”25日刊登了英国共产党政治委员会的声明，声明强调指出，目前迫切需要工人运动以及和平运动作出重大努力，来迫使政府接受关于举行东西方最高级会议的建议。
    声明指出，英国变成美国的导弹发射场将使它在未来的战争中成为火箭的头号目标。它说：“英国的生死存亡不应当取决于一个外国。英国应该摆脱美国的控制。”
    声明号召人民尽最大的努力，使得阻碍协商的人遭到决定性的失败。它要求大家现在就开始准备，以便在3月1日到美国基地去示威。在这些示威中将提出下面的要求：封闭这些基地，反对修建火箭发射场，把美国部队撤回美国。
    英国工党领袖盖次克尔26日晚在伦敦发表电视广播谈话，再次要求举行东西方“最高级”会议。
    他说，西方认为只有经过长时间的准备以后，这种会谈才适于举行，但是“我现在倒认为，俄国人在考虑的却是举行打破僵局的最高级会谈”。同时，盖次克尔认为会谈的准备工作应当是决定“会谈在哪里举行，何时举行，有谁参加，我们将讨论什么”。盖次克尔还说，从中欧撤退外国军队并且在那里建立一个中立区，将有助于恢复德国的统一。
    在英国“工人日报”的发起下，26日晚间在苏格兰的格拉斯哥举行了反对建立火箭基地的群众大会。有消息说，将要在这里建立起美国的火箭基地。
    英国著名和平人士、坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊博士在大会上说，美国的政府人士害怕和平，因为和平将为裁军铺平道路，将使战争工业倒闭。另一方面他们又害怕他们所不能取胜的战争，因此，他们只好采取第三个办法，那就是战争威胁。
    他说：苏联在取得每一个进展的同时不是吹嘘或威胁，而是提出新的和平建议，“我们这些自称为基督教西方的人难道能够拒绝那些建议吗？”
    英国合作党的“雷诺新闻”26日要求英国在争取国际互相谅解的斗争中起主导作用。它说：“不管美国是否参加，英国都应当带头催促举行最高级会谈。”
    报纸指出，工党人士应当利用自己的全部影响，促使英国政府行动起来。
