A New Contradiction and a Solution

By our reporter Lin Wei

After agricultural producers' cooperatives were established, a new contradiction appeared in the rural areas of Qin County, Shanxi Province: the development of agricultural production urgently needed the support of industry, but industry could not meet this need. For example, first, large-scale and widespread farmland irrigation and water conservancy construction required leveling instruments to survey the terrain, geological drilling for building dams, and high-pressure water gates, desilting gates, auxiliary gates, gate lifting machines, fish screens, etc. for reservoirs. However, these were very expensive. A leveling instrument cost around 400 yuan (including freight), and hiring a drilling machine to drill one meter cost around 200 yuan (including freight), and it was often difficult to get on the waiting list. High-pressure gates and gate lifting machines, etc., cost thousands of yuan, which was difficult for local areas to raise, and even if they raised the money, it was difficult to find manufacturers. Second, agricultural production required more and better fertilizers. National factories also produced some chemical fertilizers, but the price was too high, and agricultural cooperatives could not afford them. Moreover, the quantity was too small and far from enough for the actual needs of agricultural cooperatives. Third, in order to save manpower and animal power to meet the growing needs for manpower and animal power in various aspects, small simple machines and new farm tools needed to be gradually promoted; farmers did not know how to install or use these machines and new farm tools, and could not repair them when they broke down, urgently requiring industrial assistance. However, factories were too far away and had too few people to meet the requirements of so many agricultural cooperatives.

Most areas of Shanxi Province have not yet practically resolved this contradiction. Qin County has done a lot of good work in this regard in the past year and has found the correct way to solve this contradiction.

I. Manufacture and process locally using local materials in response to local needs by local factories and workshops.

Leveling instruments were needed for surveying terrain for water conservancy construction. The county's joint processing factory (local state-owned) imitated the appearance of leveling instruments and, based on the principle of leveling instruments, used cheap materials such as scrap iron and glass that could be found locally instead of expensive materials to manufacture simple leveling instruments. Each of these leveling instruments cost only 13 yuan, less than one-thirtieth of the price of leveling instruments produced by large factories. Its disadvantage was that it could not see very far, but people could divide the measurement into several sections. Judging from the situation of trial use in Qin County's reservoir and canal construction in 1957, the effect of this simple leveling instrument was very good. Several counties have now purchased from Qin County.

In order to overcome the difficulty of drilling into the stratum, the county's joint processing factory also used local materials to trial-produce a hand-cranked simple drilling machine. This drilling machine could only drill ten meters deep in total, and only one meter at a time, taking out this section to look at it before drilling down again. This was of course more troublesome, but the effect was the same in clarifying the stratum conditions within ten meters. Moreover, drilling one meter only cost 3 jiao 8 fen, less than one-five-hundredth of the price of drilling with a large drilling machine.

Under the same policy, the factory self-manufactured four-ton high-pressure water gates and gate lifting machines with the same capacity, and various important items used on reservoirs, all at about half the price of products from large factories.

In response to the needs of rural production and life, this factory produced rice milling machines, wheat sieving machines, grain throwers, corn cob grinders, various steel mills, windmills, powered waterwheels, manual water presses, water turbines for small hydropower generation, and about 40 other types of small machinery, which were generally very suitable and inexpensive.

Were there enough technical personnel? This was indeed a big problem in a county. But it was not helpless. Qin County's joint processing factory originally had only four technicians, which was not enough. Later, the county party committee searched everywhere in the handicraft system, demobilized soldiers and intellectuals in the countryside, and teachers in secondary schools, and finally found ten or so industrial technical personnel. Added to this were staff in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry who understood some technology. They formed new product trial production teams and research teams to regularly study and solve various difficult problems together. The simple leveling instrument was designed with the help of a physics and chemistry teacher from a Qin County middle school, and the glass cylinder was directly installed by the middle school's laboratory. The round iron cylinder and wooden frame were manufactured by people from the iron industry cooperative and the wood industry cooperative. Two intellectuals in the countryside who had previously studied industrial technology helped the factory with sand casting, which greatly reduced the number of defective products; they also helped to draw design drawings for various machines and other products.

The workers' high enthusiasm for learning technology, manufacturing new products, and serving the development of agricultural production under the active leadership of the county party committee was very touching. A drilling machine from the province passed through Qin County and stopped on the street. The machine was quickly covered with workers. They did not know how to draw, so they drew many circles, dots, and lines in their notebooks to help them remember. Then they trial-produced this product once, twice, and three times, never giving up. The joint processing factory now produces 94 main products, most of which are the result of the workers' hard work and courageous spirit of creation. Some workers have grown or are growing into technical personnel through long-term production practice. They are all very talented people.

Now, Qin County is still experimenting with many new machines, and even pot-boiler engines are being self-manufactured. A comrade in charge of industry in the special district highly praised the spirit of bold creation of the workers in Qin County. He joked, "The only thing they dare not build is artificial satellites."

II. Adopt diverse organizational forms to overcome investment difficulties and enable agricultural cooperatives to enjoy the fruits of industry.

Both the government and agricultural cooperatives are short of money, which is a major difficulty at the local level. Producing chemical fertilizers, various small machines and new farm tools, and running various small enterprises such as power generation and flour milling to serve agricultural production and improve farmers' lives all require a certain amount of funding. In solving this problem, Qin County has created many forms:

The first is joint operation between factories and agricultural cooperatives. There is a lot of peat in the Kaicun area of Qin County. This peat can be used to produce granular fertilizer, one jin of which can be worth one dan of farm fertilizer. However, if it were all invested by the government, the government would not have so much money; the production cost would also be too high, and agricultural cooperatives could not afford it. The method of joint operation between factories and agricultural cooperatives overcame this difficulty. The specific approach was that the factory provided equipment, and the agricultural cooperatives provided labor, and brought their own rations and simple tools. After the fertilizer was produced, it was directly distributed and used by the cooperatives, and the problem of sales was also solved. People working in the peat plant recorded work points in the agricultural cooperatives and received dividends, and the factory no longer provided other remuneration. These workers could also return to the agricultural cooperatives to work during the busy farming season, without delaying agricultural work.

The second is joint operation between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. The small power plant in Guxian Town, Qin County, belongs to this type. The power was provided by the handicraft cooperative, on the one hand driving electric saws, electric drills, lathes (for repairs), etc. in the handicraft sector, and on the other hand driving water pumps, flour mills, and rice milling machines in the agricultural cooperatives for pumping water for irrigation, milling flour, and milling rice. It also provided lighting for farmers' homes. Labor was provided by the agricultural cooperatives, and technical assistance was provided by the county's joint factory.

The third is joint operation between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. The electric mill and small hydropower station in Manshui Village, Qin County, belong to this type. In addition to a small amount of assistance from the state, all the equipment required for the electric mill and power generation was provided by the supply and marketing cooperative, and the agricultural cooperative provided labor. The agricultural cooperative could use this small enterprise to process corn stalks, grind flour, and provide lighting for itself.

The county calculated that it would take 110,000 yuan to start these three enterprises relying solely on the state, while now the state only spent 20,000 yuan to accomplish it. From the perspective of agricultural cooperatives, labor had better uses and made many money-saving deals. For example, the original price of granular fertilizer was 7 fen 4 per jin, but now it is only 3 fen 9. Some cooperatives can also simply exchange labor for fertilizer without spending any money. The low-priced electricity for lighting in villages such as Manshui is also envied by ordinary farmers. This method of joint operation may be an appropriate way to develop the economy and culture in the vast rural areas for a certain period of time.

III. Joint Operation of Various Industries

The joint processing factory itself also represents a form of organization. For a small rural area, this form should be said to be very good. Some counties doubt this form and advocate that various industries should be operated separately, without interfering with each other. Now it seems that this is inappropriate. Qin County's joint processing factory used to be a specialized egg factory. Without eggs in winter, there was nothing to do, and it had to stop work for five months of the year. Now this problem has been solved: when winter comes and the egg factory stops, everyone comes to dig saltpeter soil, boil saltpeter, and make brine (fertilizer). Oil extraction has less business in winter, and manpower can be turned to printing (there are activities such as exchanging account books at the end of the year, so the printing factory is busy). The original contradiction between the continuity required by industrial production and the seasonality of rural raw materials and markets has now been resolved due to the joint operation of various industries.

The county's lack of sufficient industrial funding also makes this joint operation necessary. For example, it costs money to trial-produce various new products; repairing farm tools also often loses some money (because you can't ask the agricultural cooperatives for too much money but you have to ensure quality). Where does the money come from? When doing a single profession, you have to reach out to the government for money; now you can use profitable industries such as the egg industry to support loss-making industries, or as the county committee members said, "use light industry to support heavy industry," so that both can be developed.

IV. Factory - School - Technical Advisor

Brine is a very good top dressing in the minds of the people of Qin County. Watering and then applying brine will make the soil loose and ventilated, and better absorb and retain moisture. Therefore, the county's joint processing factory came to produce this fertilizer. But the county's leading organs did not allow the factory's activities to be limited to within the factory. On the one hand, they organized agricultural cooperatives in various places to also produce brine, and at the same time organized the joint factory to provide technical guidance to the small-scale production of various cooperatives. The agricultural cooperatives could originally only produce water but not blocks, and could not refine fire saltpeter. Later, under the guidance of the factory's technical personnel, the cooperatives learned both skills. Under the impetus of the factory, more than 50 groups have now been organized by the cooperatives to produce brine. The factory also trains workers centrally for various agricultural cooperatives, with a five-day period (there are also those who come to learn from other counties). It can be seen here that Qin County uses the joint processing factory as a technical school and technical advisor at the same time.

The factory technicians and skilled workers in Qin County are also responsible for installing and repairing various agricultural machinery and new farm tools for agricultural cooperatives, such as pot-boiler engines, diesel engines, harvesting and seeding machines, flour milling and rice milling machines, and double-share plows, etc. At the same time, they help agricultural cooperatives train people to use machinery. Some have signed contracts for guaranteed teaching and learning. Not only that, they also help agricultural cooperatives train tailors, farriers, and people who sew and repair car covers and harnesses, etc. As long as it is something needed to develop agricultural production, no matter how small, they do not get tired of doing it.

The Correct Policy for Solving Contradictions

Shen Luming (Shēn Lǔmíng), the first secretary of the Qin County Party Committee (a member of the prefectural party committee sent to work at the grassroots level), told reporters that before 1957, the Qin County Party Committee, like many other county party committees, lacked research on the direction of local industry. When they thought of factories, they only hoped that they could help everyone turn on electric lights and make a loudspeaker for holding meetings. As for the gradual use of machinery and even mechanization in agriculture, everyone completely turned their eyes to big cities and big factories. However, the production upsurge after the cooperative movement raised more and more practical problems, forcing the county party committee to repeatedly consider ways to solve them: many machines and new farm tools were broken, and farmers did not know how to repair them; or they were missing a part that could not be replaced and could not be used; agricultural cooperatives bought waterwheels but could not install them; building reservoirs and canals required various machines and tools, but there was no way to get them; but the county's factories were soliciting work from outside the area, unable to get lucrative jobs, unwilling to do less profitable jobs, constantly stopping work, often losing money, and unable to find a direction. The county party committee's practical consideration and serious study of these practical problems enabled them to have a more concrete understanding of the policy of the higher-level party committee's instructions in February 1957 that county-run enterprises must "face the countryside and actively serve the rural economy." From the spring, they decided that the first secretary, who had more knowledge of industrial production, would be responsible for leading the joint processing factory and the county's industry. He and the county's industrial minister often went to the factory to help the factory solve various problems in its work, correct the incorrect ideas of the workers and masses, encourage everyone to serve agricultural production, and often took the farmers' requirements for the factory as topics to raise at the factory, directly helping to organize technical teams, taking the lead in labor, learning technology, and also helping to solve the funding problems for trial-producing new products…. This series of activities made everyone's vision clear, and they saw a new direction. When progress was made on the new road, praise and rewards were immediately given, which made everyone more and more energetic. Now, the county's industrial products have greatly increased, all of them have sales channels, and they have strongly supported and promoted agricultural production and water conservancy construction. The factory itself has also turned from losing money to making money and has begun to accumulate funds for the country. I think that Qin County's policy of local industry directly serving local agriculture and local industry and agriculture developing side by side can be used as a common policy for various places, because, as far as I know, this problem has not been well resolved in many counties.

    一个新的矛盾和解决的途径
    本报记者  林韦
    农业生产合作化以后，山西沁县的农村里出现了一种新的矛盾：农业生产的发展急切需要工业的支援，而工业不能满足这种需要。比如说，第一，大规模地普遍兴修农田水利需要勘测地势的水平仪，筑拦河坝需要地质钻探，水库上需要高压水闸、冲沙闸、预备闸、起闸机、拦鱼网等等。但这些都非常昂贵。一个水平仪要四百元左右（包括运费），请钻探机来钻一公尺也要二百元左右（包括运费），而且经常排不上队。高压闸和起闸机等，都要一千几百元，地方上很难筹措这么多钱，筹到钱也很难找到承制的单位。第二，农业生产要求更多更好的肥料，国家的工厂也生产了一些化学肥料，但价钱太大，农业社买不起。而且数量也太少，农业社真正要用的话就大大不够。第三，为了节省人力畜力来满足各方面对于人力畜力的日益增长的需要，要逐渐推广小型的简单机械和新式农具；这些机械和新农具，农民不会安装，不会使用，坏了不会修理，急需工业方面来帮助，但工厂离得太远，人也少，无法应付这么多农业社的要求。
    山西省的多数地区还没有在实际上解决这种矛盾。沁县一年来在这方面做了许多很好的工作，寻找到了解决这种矛盾的正确途径。
    一、针对当地需要，由当地的工厂、作坊就地取材，就地制造和加工。
    修水利勘测地势需要水平仪，县的联合加工厂（地方国营）就仿效水平仪的模样，根据水平仪的原理，用当地能够找得到的废铁、玻璃等便宜材料代替贵重的材料，制造了简易的水平仪。这种水平仪一部只要十三元，不及大工厂生产的水平仪价格的三十分之一。它的缺点是不能看得很远，但人们可以多分几段来勘测。从1957年沁县各地修筑水库、水渠时试用的情形看，这种简易水平仪的功效是很好的。若干县份现在已经向沁县购买。
    为了克服钻探地层的困难，县联合加工厂也是用当地材料，试制了一种手摇的简单钻探机。这种钻机一共只能钻十公尺深，一次只能钻一公尺，拿出这一截来看了再往下钻，这当然麻烦一些，但在弄清十公尺内的地层情况上作用是一样的。而且钻一公尺只要三角八分钱，不及大钻机钻价的五百分之一。
    在同一方针下，这工厂自制了四吨重的高压水闸及同样能力的起闸机等水库上用的各种重要东西，价格都只有大工厂产品价格的一半左右。
    针对农村生产和生活的需要，这个工厂生产了碾米机、筛麦机、甩谷机、玉米棒磨粉机、各种钢磨、风车、动力水车、人力压水机、小型水力发电用的水轮机等四十种左右的小型机械，一般都很适用，便宜。
    技术人材够用么？在一个县里，这的确是大问题。但并不是束手无策。沁县的联合加工厂原来只有四名技工，不够用。后来县委在手工业系统中，复员军人和在乡知识分子中，在中等学校的教员中到处搜罗，终于搜罗到十来个工业技术人材，加上农林牧各方面懂得一些技术的工作人员，组成新产品试制小组、研究小组，定期共同研究，解决各种困难问题。简易水平仪，是沁县中学校一个理化教员帮助设计的，并且由中学的化验室直接装置了玻璃圆筒。圆铁筒和木架子，则是由铁业合作社和木业合作社的人们制造的。两个过去念过工业专科的在乡知识分子，曾经帮助工厂搞翻砂，使次品大大减少；曾经帮助绘制了各种机械和其他产品的设计图。
    工人们在县委的积极领导之下学习技术、制造新产品、为发展农业生产服务的高度热情，是十分感人的。省里有一架钻探机路过沁县，停在街道上，机器上很快就爬满了工人。他们不会制图，就在自己的本子上画上许多圈圈，点点，道道，帮助记忆，回头就一次二次三次地试制这种产品，百折不回。联合加工厂现在生产九十四种主要产品，多半是工人们这种艰苦学习和勇敢创造精神的结晶。有一些工人经过长期的生产实践，已经或正在成长为技术人员。他们都是非常有天才的人。
    现在，沁县还在试验许多种新的机器，连锅驼机也在自制。专区搞工业的一位同志极口赞扬沁县工人们这种大胆创造精神，他开玩笑说，“只有人造卫星他们不敢造。”
    二、采取多样的组织形式克服投资的困难，并使农业社能享受工业的成果。
    政府和农业社都缺钱，这是目前地方上很大的困难。要生产化学肥料，生产各种小型机械和新农具，开办各种小型企业如发电、磨粉等来服务农业生产和改善农民生活，都需要一定数量的经费。在解决这一问题上，沁县创造了许多种形式：
    第一种，工厂和农业社合营。沁县开村一带泥炭很多。用这种泥炭可以生产颗粒肥料，一斤能顶一担农家肥料。但如果全部由政府投资开办，政府没有这么多钱；生产出来成本也太高，农业社买不起。工厂和农业社合营的办法，克服了这一困难。具体的做法是工厂提供设备，各农业社提供人力，并自带给养和简单的工具。生产出肥料以后，就由各社直接分配使用，推销的问题也解决了。在泥炭厂作工的人，都在农业社记工分红，工厂不再给其他报酬。这些工人在农忙的时候还可以回农业社劳动，不误农时。
    第二种，手工业社和农业社合营。沁县故县镇的小型电厂就属于这一种。动力是手工业社提供的，一方面带动手工业方面的电锯、电钻、元车（修理用）等，一方面带动农业社的抽水机、磨面机和碾米机，用以抽水浇田，碾米磨面。还给农家照明。人力由农业社提供，技术由县联合厂援助。
    第三种，供销社和农业社合营。沁县漫水村的电磨和小型水力发电站属于这一种。除国家给予少量援助外，电磨和发电所需一切设备都由供销社提供，农业社提供人力。农业社可以利用这个小企业为自己加工玉米轴，磨面，照明。
    县里计算了一下，光靠国家，这三个企业要拿出十一万元才行，而现在国家只拿出二万元就办成了。从农业社方面看，则是人力有了更好的用途，做了许多省钱的买卖。比如颗粒肥料原来一斤的价格是七分四，现在只有三分九。有的社还可以根本不花钱，干脆用劳力换肥料。漫水等村贱价点电灯，也为一般农民所羡慕。这种合营的办法，在一定的时期内，可能是广大农村发展经济文化的适当办法。
  三、各种行业联合经营
    联合加工厂本身也代表着一种组织形式。对于一个小小的农村地区说来，这种形式应当说是很好的。有一些县份怀疑这种形式，主张各行业分开经营，互不发生瓜葛，现在看这是不恰当的。沁县的联合加工厂过去是个专业的蛋厂，冬天无蛋即无事，一年要停工五个月。现在这问题解决了：冬天到来，蛋厂停了，大家就来挖硝土，熬硝，做卤水（肥料）。榨油冬天业务较少，人力就可以转向印刷（年终有换账簿等活动，所以印刷厂忙）。工业生产所要求的连续性和农村原料及市场的季节性之间原来有矛盾，现在因各行业联合经营而解决了。
    县里没有充足的工业经费，也使这种联合经营成为必需。比如要试制各种新产品，就得花钱；修农具也经常要赔一些钱（因为不能多向农业社要钱而又要保证质量）。钱从哪里来呢？单独搞一个专业时就得向政府伸手要钱；现在则可以用赚钱的行业如蛋业来养活赔钱的行业，或者如县委委员们所说，“用轻工业养活重工业”，使两者都得到发展。
    四、工厂——学校——技术顾问
    卤水是沁县人们心目中一种很好的追肥。浇了水再上了卤，就会使土壤松软透风，更好地吸收和保持水分。所以县的联合加工厂就来生产这种肥料。但县的领导机关没有让工厂的活动只限制在工厂以内。他们一方面组织各地农业社也生产卤水，同时组织联合厂对各社的小规模生产进行技术指导。农业社原来只能生产水而不能生产块，也不能提炼火硝。后来经过工厂技术人员指导，这两样技能各社都学会了。在工厂带动下，现在各社已经组织了五十多个小组生产卤水。工厂还为各农业社集中训练工人，五天一期（外县也有来学的）。这里可以看出，沁县是把联合加工厂同时当作技术学校和技术顾问使用的。
    沁县的工厂技术人员、技工，还负责为农业社安装和修理各种农业机械和新农具，如锅驼机、柴油机、收割和播种机，磨面和碾米机，以及双铧犁等等。同时帮助农业社训练使用机械的人。有的订有包教包学的合同。不仅如此，他们还帮农业社训练裁缝，钉马掌人，缝补车套笼头的人，等等。只要是发展农业生产所需要的事，无论多么细小，他们都不厌其烦地去干。
        解决矛盾的正确方针
    沁县县委第一书记申鲁明（下放的地委委员）告诉记者：1957年以前，沁县县委也同其他许多县委一样，对本地工业的方向缺少研究。想到工厂时只是希望他们能够帮助大家点上电灯，造个扩音器开大会用。至于农业上逐步使用机械以至机械化的问题，谁也是把目光完全朝向大城市大工厂。但是，合作化以后的生产高潮提出了越来越多的现实问题，迫使县委不得不反复考虑解决的途径：许多机械和新农具坏了，农民不会修；或者是缺了一个零件补不上，不能用；农业社买了水车安装不起来；修水库水渠要用这样那样的一些机械和工具，都没有办法；而县的工厂却在向外地揽活，赚大钱的活揽不到，赚钱少的活不想干，不断停工，时常赔钱，找不到方向。县委对这些现实问题的切实考虑，认真研究，使他们对上级党委1957年2月间所指示的县营企业必须“面向农村、积极为农村经济服务”的方针有了较为具体的理解。从春季起，他们就确定由对工业生产较有知识的第一书记分工领导联合加工厂和全县工业。他和县委工业部长经常下厂，帮助工厂解决工作中各种问题，扭转职工群众中不正确的思想，鼓励大家为农业生产服务，并且经常把农民对工厂的要求当作课题提到工厂来，直接帮助组织技术队伍，带头劳动，学习技术，也帮助解决试制新产品的经费问题……。这一系列的活动，使大家目光由暗而明，看到了新方向。在新道路上有了进展，马上给以表扬和奖励，这就使得大家越干越有劲了。现在，这个县的工业产品大大增多，件件都有销路，有力地支援和推动了农业生产和水利建设，工厂本身也由赔钱转为赚钱，开始能为国家积累资金了。沁县这种地方工业直接为地方农业服务，地方工业和农业并肩发展的方针，我以为可以作为各地的共同方针，因为，据我所知，这个问题在许多县还没有得到很好的解决。
