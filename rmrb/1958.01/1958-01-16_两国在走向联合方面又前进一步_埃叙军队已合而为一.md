    两国在走向联合方面又前进一步
    埃叙军队已合而为一
    新华社开罗14日电　叙利亚武装部队总司令兼参谋长比兹里今天下午对中东通讯社记者说，埃及军队和叙利亚军队现在已经变成一支军队了。
    比兹里又说，埃及和叙利亚在同帝国主义进行的大规模斗争中获得了胜利，这标志着这两个国家在走向联合方面又前进了一步。他说，叙利亚军队日益强大，准备应付任何紧急情况。
    比兹里表示他对于一个团结一致的阿拉伯民族具有充分信心。他说，帝国主义看到这样的一个民族时将会感到愤怒、失望和丢脸。
    比兹里13日访问了埃及军事学院。他向军事学院中的叙利亚学员们说，他们将被培养成为统一的埃叙陆军的第一批成员。
    比兹里又说，自从埃及军队去年10月为了援助叙利亚对付土耳其的军事挑衅而开到叙利亚以后，埃叙军队曾经一起防守在共同的阵地上，并且一直在进行联合演习。他强调指出，阿拉伯国家必须团结起来抵抗它们共同的敌人。
    同一天，比兹里还会见了埃及空军参谋长和陆军参谋长。
