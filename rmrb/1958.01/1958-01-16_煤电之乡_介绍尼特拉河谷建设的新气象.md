Coal and Electricity Home
——Introducing the New Look of Construction in the Nitra Valley
Czechoslovakia　A. Bednash

Before liberation, the Nitra Valley in Czechoslovakia (this river is in central Czechoslovakia, flowing south into the Danube) was a marquis's estate; in the era of the people's democratic regime, it became an industrially developed region. Indeed, in the days of the Czechoslovak Republic before 1938, there were also industrial enterprises here, but those enterprises were very weak and pitiful. At that time, the people of the Nitra Mountains were still forced to leave their homes and seek work in distant places or abroad.

Now, the Nitra Mountains are a completely different picture. From the town of Handlová along the Nitra River to the city of Nitra, there is a long snake-like complex of factory buildings and enterprises that have started operations. The mines in Handlová have been modernized, and large-scale mine shafts have been put into production. In the past decade, the mining volume of this mine has increased several times.

In the small town of Cígeľ, not far from Handlová, a mine producing 900,000 tons of coal for the country each year is about to be put into production.

The mining town of Handlová, nestled against the hillside, has now become a modern city with thousands of well-equipped and comfortable new homes. Unlike some other coal-producing areas where the sky is gray and black, the special equipment installed in the power plant has eliminated the coal smoke that used to fill the sky.

The brown coal mine, "Peace" mine, "Legoda" mine, and "Eleventh" mine located in the nearby town of Nováky, like the newly established Youth Mine, can barely supply the needs of one of the largest thermal power stations in the Czechoslovak Republic—the Zemianske Kostoľany power station. Although the power station project has not yet been completed, the electricity it currently generates is equivalent to the total electricity generated by all power stations in Slovakia in 1937. An overhead bridge connects this thermal power station to the various mines, and coal is transported directly from the mines to a huge coal storage via the overhead bridge, and then automatically fed into the boilers from the coal storage. The Kostoľany power station not only transmits electricity to central and southern Slovakia through high-voltage lines, but also helps industrial enterprises in Hungary.

Nováky also has a modern chemical plant, which is named after the president of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck. In addition to general chemical industrial products, this factory also produces many new types of plastics.

The Baťa factory in the former Partizánske has been greatly expanded, and the production of leather shoes, especially rubber shoes, has been greatly improved. More than 60% of the rubber products workshop's products are sold to ninety countries. The leather factory in Bošany recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. This factory produces high-quality conveyor belts and leather needed by shoe factories.

The timber processing industry is concentrated in the small town of Topoľčany, slightly to the south. A large joint factory mainly produces modern furniture, most of which is exported to Western countries. There are also large garment factories and the most modern "electrical appliance" factories. During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, a brewery and a huge malt manufacturing plant will be built in Topoľčany.

Many new factories will also be built in the lower reaches of the Nitra River. One of them is a porcelain factory, which will be built in Chynorany village. There are already modern enterprises in the construction industry here—asphalt concrete factories.

A dam near the village of Jarok cuts off the Nitra River, and a small hydropower station is built on the dam. A dam was also built on the Belianka River, a tributary of the Nitra River, and this artificial lake supplies water to industrial enterprises near the upper reaches of the Nitra River.

The entire area around the upper reaches of the Nitra River, stretching for one hundred kilometers, is a construction site. Not only are factories growing and expanding here, but cities and towns are also forming. From the train, you can see new residential areas, where people who work in new factories and live happy lives reside. The former Nitra Mountain area was mainly an agricultural area, and it will become a coal and electricity home with modern industry in the era of Czechoslovakia's Five-Year Plan.

    煤电之乡
    ——介绍尼特拉河谷建设的新气象
    捷克斯洛伐克　阿·别德纳斯赫
    捷克斯洛伐克的尼特拉河谷（这条河在捷克斯洛伐克中部，往南注入多瑙河），解放前是一个侯爵的田庄；在人民民主政权年代里它成了工业发达的地区。的确，在1938年以前的捷克斯洛伐克共和国年代里，这里也曾有过工业企业，但是那些企业是非常薄弱可怜的，那时，尼特拉山区的人民仍然被迫背乡离井投奔远方或到国外去寻找工作。
    现在的尼特拉山区则完全是另外一番气象了。从冈德洛瓦城沿着尼特拉河直到尼特拉城是一条长蛇般的工厂建筑群和已开工的企业。冈德洛瓦城的矿场已经现代化了，大型矿井也已投入生产，最近十年内这个矿井的开采量增加了好几倍。
    在位于冈德洛瓦城不远的茨格里小镇上，每年为国家生产九十万吨煤的矿井即将投入生产。
    紧贴山坡的冈德洛瓦这个矿工小镇，现在变成了现代化的城市，并拥有千百幢装备完善、舒适的新住宅。这个地方不像其他一些产煤地区那样天空是灰黑色的，发电厂安装的特殊的设备使过去弥漫着天空的煤烟都消失了。
    位于离此不远的诺瓦克小镇上的褐煤矿、“和平”矿、“列戈达”矿“十一号”矿，像重新建立起来的青年矿一样，刚能供得上捷克斯洛伐克共和国最大的热电站之一——泽米杨斯克·科斯多拉雷发电站的需要。尽管发电站的工程尚未完成，目前它发出的电力已相当于1937年斯洛伐克全部发电站发电量的总和。架空桥把这个热电站与各矿井连结起来，煤直接从矿井通过架空桥输送到一个巨大的煤库，然后从煤库自动地投入锅炉。科斯多拉雷发电站不仅通过高压线向斯洛伐克中部和南部输送电力，而且还帮助了匈牙利的工业企业。
    诺瓦克也有现代化的化学工厂，这个工厂是以德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克的名字命名的。除了一般化学工业产品以外，这个工厂还生产许多种新的塑料。
    从前游击城的拔佳工厂大大地扩建了，皮鞋，特别是胶鞋的生产大大地提高了。橡胶产品车间60％以上的产品行销到九十个国家。设在波山的皮革工厂不久以前刚庆祝过建厂一百周年纪念。这个工厂生产优等质量的传送带以及皮鞋厂所需要的皮革。
    木材加工工业都集中在稍向南一点的托波尔昌小城里。一家大的联合工厂主要是生产现代化的家具，大部输往西方国家。这里还有很大的成衣工厂和最现代化的“电器”工厂。第二个五年计划期内在托波尔昌将建成啤酒工厂和巨大的麦芽制造厂。
    尼特拉河下游一带也将建立许多新的工厂。其中之一就是瓷器工厂，它将建立在乔布村。这里已有建筑工业的现代化企业——沥青混凝土工厂。
    一条堤坝在叶尔索夫泽村附近把尼特拉河拦腰截断，堤坝上建立了一个不大的水电站。在尼特拉河支流别兰克河上也建立了一道堤坝，这个人造湖为尼特拉河上游附近的工业企业供水。
    尼特拉河上游周围长达一百公里的整个地带就是一个建筑工地。这里不仅工厂在成长和扩大，而且形成了城市和乡镇。从火车上可以看得见一片片新的住宅，住在这里的是在新的工厂工作、过着幸福生活的人们。从前的尼特拉山区主要是农业区，它在捷克斯洛伐克五年计划的年代将成为拥有现代化工业的煤电之乡。　（吴传铎译）（附图片）
