Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 15th. The border areas of Yunnan, once known as "lands of miasma," have now controlled the spread of malaria. In Simao, Shuangjiang, Gengma, Mangshi, Malipo, and the Menglang Dam area of the Lancang River, where malaria was once severe, the disease has been basically eliminated.

Yunnan's border areas are located in the subtropics, and the dam areas are densely covered with swamps and paddy fields, providing a good environment for the breeding of mosquitoes and larvae. According to investigations by relevant departments in Yunnan Province, there are dozens of species of mosquitoes in fourteen genera in Yunnan's border areas, among which the main carrier of malaria is the Anopheles minimus. Malaria has been prevalent here for more than 1,700 years. Legend has it that during the Three Kingdoms period, there was the story of Zhuge Liang sacrificing to the Lancang River. The "Taiping Huanyu Ji" states: "The Marquis of Wu's army suffered from epidemics here, and they were buried in a large tomb." The so-called "stuffy miasma," "mute miasma," "colorful miasma," and "toad miasma" prevalent among the minority peoples in the border areas before liberation were all symptoms of malignant malaria. This type of malaria struck quickly, with peculiar symptoms, and some people died within a few hours of onset.

Before liberation, due to the prevalence of malaria and man-made disasters, a large number of people died in Yunnan's border areas. Simao, an important town in southern Yunnan, began to suffer from malaria in 1919. By the time of liberation in 1950, the city's population had plummeted from more than 50,000 to less than 1,000, and most of the remaining population was also infected with malaria. Mangshi, Gengma, Shuangjiang, and the Menglang Dam area of Lancang also had similar histories to Simao. Since liberation in 1950, relevant departments in Yunnan Province and the People's Liberation Army stationed in the border areas have successively established thirteen malaria prevention stations, offices, and many mobile malaria prevention teams in the border areas. They have conducted detailed investigations, research, and observations and analyses on the epidemic factors, patterns, mosquito habits, and drug efficacy of malaria in the malaria-affected areas of more than 100,000 square kilometers in the border areas. Malaria prevention workers have traversed all the villages in the malaria-affected areas, spraying mosquitoes with drugs and providing free or subsidized physical examinations, malaria treatment, and drug prevention for people of all ethnic groups. At the same time, they have also mobilized and organized people of all ethnic groups to carry out patriotic health campaigns with the elimination of malaria mosquitoes as the main goal. Many villages have now established and maintained hygiene systems. Malaria mosquitoes in key areas have been basically eliminated. In recent years, the incidence and mortality rates of malaria in Yunnan's border areas have declined rapidly. The average mortality rate in 1956 had fallen from 0.419% in 1953 to 0.196%, with less than one person out of every hundred contracting the disease. By 1957, the spread of malaria had been controlled or eliminated. The population of Simao City has increased to more than 4,000.

### 云南边疆人民大喜事  流行千年的疟疾受到控制

    云南边疆人民大喜事
    流行千年的疟疾受到控制
    新华社昆明15日电　曾被人们称为“瘴疠之地”的云南边疆地区，现在已经控制了疟疾的流行，过去疟疾流行严重的思茅、双江、耿马、芒市、麻栗坡和澜沧江的勐朗坝等地，疟疾已基本消灭。
    云南边疆地处亚热带，坝区沼泽稻田密布，是蚊虫孑孓孳生的良好环境。据云南省有关部门的调查，云南边疆的蚊子有十四属几十种，其中传染疟疾的主要是微小按蚊。疟疾在这里流行已有一千七百多年的历史。相传三国时代，就有诸葛亮祭澜水的故事。“太平寰宇记”中说：“武侯军此，遭疫疠，以大塚葬之。”解放前流传在边疆少数民族人民中的所谓“闷头瘴”、“哑吧瘴”、“彩色瘴”、“蛤蟆瘴”，就是恶性疟疾的各种症状。这种疟疾来得猛，症状奇特，有的发病几小时内就死去。
    解放前，由于疟疾流行和人为的灾难，云南边疆地区大量人口死亡。滇南重镇思茅从1919年起就开始流行疟疾，到1950年解放时，全城人口已由三十多年前的五万人锐减到不足千人，仅存的人口中也大都染有疟疾。芒市、耿马、双江和澜沧的勐朗坝，也都有过类似思茅的历史。从1950年解放以来，云南省有关部门和进驻边疆的人民解放军，曾先后在边疆地区设置了十三个防疟站、所和许多巡回防疟队，先后在边疆十余万平方公里的疟疾区，对疟疾的流行因素、规律、疟蚊习性以及药物疗效等进行了详细的调查研究和观察分析。防治疟疾的工作人员踏遍了疟区所有的村寨，他们用药物喷杀蚊子，并免费或酌量收费为各族人民检查体格、治疗疟疾和进行药物预防。同时还动员组织各族人民开展了以消灭疟蚊为主的爱国卫生运动。现在已有许多村寨建立和坚持了卫生制度。各重点区的疟蚊已基本消灭。几年来，云南边疆疟疾的发病率和病死率迅速下降，1956年平均病死率已由1953年的0.419％降低到0.196％，一百个人当中发病的不到一个人，1957年已经控制或消灭了疟疾的流行。思茅城的居民已增加到四千人以上。
