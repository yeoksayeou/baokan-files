He Dejiang Guarantees 200,000 Kilometers of Safe Driving

He Dejiang, a famous young underground electric locomotive driver at the Xiaqiao Coal Mine of the Jiawang Mining Bureau, recently pledged to drive 200,000 kilometers safely during the Second Five-Year Plan. By the last day of the First Five-Year Plan, he had already driven 88,700 kilometers safely.

He Dejiang concentrates all his attention when he gets on the electric locomotive. He says this is an old habit of his. On December 20th last year, as he was driving the electric locomotive through a bend, just as the head of the locomotive turned the corner, he suddenly saw a person squatting in the middle of the track four or five meters away. He gripped the brake handle tightly and slammed on the brakes. The car stopped, but the front of the car was already close to the person's shoulder. He Dejiang can also grasp the rules of the roadways and the performance of the electric locomotive. Before going to work every day, he silently thinks about the roadway conditions, and how to prevent accidents when driving in a certain place.

He Dejiang drives the No. 3 car—a famous "old car". His apprentice wanted to exchange the best No. 1 car for him, but he refused. He said: "I should do the most difficult thing, so that I will not fail the trust of the Party and comrades in me."

    何德江保证安全行车二十万公里
    贾汪矿务局夏桥煤矿著名的青年井下电车司机何德江，最近订出在第二个五年计划内安全行车二十万公里的保证。到第一个五年计划最后一天，他已经安全行车八万八千七百公里。
    何德江一上电车全神贯注。他说这是他的老习惯。去年12月20日，他开着电车通过一段弯道，电车头刚转弯，突然发现离车四、五公尺处的铁道中间蹲着一个人。他紧紧握住闸把急煞车。车煞住了，车头已靠近那个人的肩膀。何德江开电车还能掌握巷道规律和电车性能，每天上班前总要默默地思考巷道情况，开到什么地方怎样防止事故。
    何德江开的是三号车——有名的“老爷车”，他的徒弟要把最好的一号车换给他，他拒绝了。他说：“我应该做最困难的事，这样才不辜负党和同志们对我的信任。”
