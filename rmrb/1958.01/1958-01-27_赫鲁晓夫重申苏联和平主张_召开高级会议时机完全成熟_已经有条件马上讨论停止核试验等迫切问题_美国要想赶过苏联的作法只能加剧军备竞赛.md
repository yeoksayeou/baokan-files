Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th. TASS reported from Moscow on January 25th: At a meeting of advanced agricultural producers in Belarus on January 22nd, Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stated that the Soviet government believes that the necessity for a high-level meeting of Eastern and Western countries is now fully ripe. The Soviet Union is ready to participate in such a meeting at any time.

Khrushchev cited examples of issues that could be discussed at a high-level conference, including: the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, the cessation of the "Cold War" and war propaganda, the reduction of the number of foreign troops currently stationed in Germany and other European countries, the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Europe, the situation in the Middle East, the elimination of obstacles to the development of international economics, and so on.

Khrushchev said, "We believe that conditions are right to immediately discuss these issues at a meeting of heads of state. We do not exclude other important issues; other important issues can also be discussed at a high-level meeting of heads of state, and certain, positive results can be achieved on these issues."

In this speech, Khrushchev addressed the international situation. He began by saying that the international situation has undergone significant changes and has greatly improved compared to a year ago.

Khrushchev said that in late 1956, well-known events occurred in Hungary. In some other People's Democratic countries, primarily in Poland, certain difficulties also arose. The reactionary crows cawed with glee, saying that the collapse and crisis of communism had begun and that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries were facing insurmountable difficulties. Aggressive forces in the West believed that a favorable opportunity had arrived for them to change the situation in the Middle East and consolidate their colonialist position there. At that time, the governments of Britain, France, and Israel launched a military adventure to attack Egypt. However, the imperialists' calculation of betting on the counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary failed. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary bandits were crushed in just three days, and revolutionary order was restored. Naturally, serious economic difficulties still existed there due to the activities of the counter-revolutionaries, and efforts had to be made to make up for the losses caused to the national economy by the fascist rioters.

In the People's Republic of Poland, many difficulties also remained, and measures were being taken to strengthen the People's Democratic system. Recently, at the invitation of Comrades Gomulka and Cyrankiewicz, I made a three-day visit to Poland and held friendly talks with Polish leaders. After this meeting, I am convinced that the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Gomulka, can correctly utilize all its strength and potential to overcome the existing difficulties and strive for new achievements in developing the country's socialist economy and improving the people's welfare.

**Imperialism's "Predictions" about the Soviet Union have all Failed**

Khrushchev said that the imperialists' "predictions" about the Soviet Union, about the strength and consolidation of our socialist system, have been shamefully bankrupt. When we criticized the shortcomings in our agriculture, the imperialists began to shout about a "crisis" in Soviet agriculture, saying that the Bolsheviks were now unable to "get out of it." Now everyone sees how we have emerged from this "crisis." Our Party has successfully fulfilled the plan to increase the output of many important livestock products, originally scheduled for six years, in just three years. Later, when we raised the issue of reorganizing the management of industry and construction, the capitalists again began to shout that the Soviet industrial sector was not working well and that the Bolsheviks could not overcome the difficulties in industrial development. But half a year has passed, and these predictions of our enemies have likewise been bankrupt.

The imperialists were particularly intoxicated with the idea that the socialist system could not promote the development of science and culture and that it restricted human activity. But this bourgeois lie has come to an end. Suddenly, an intercontinental ballistic rocket was launched in the Soviet Union. Based on the intercontinental ballistic rocket, an artificial Earth satellite was launched. After the launch of the two artificial Earth satellites, even the most stubborn skeptics could no longer spread lies about the state of Soviet science, culture, and technology.

**The Soviet Union Can Launch Artificial Satellites that are Much Heavier**

But some people are talking nonsense, saying that Germans helped the Russians create ballistic rockets. They say that the Russians captured a group of German scientists and engineers and used their knowledge and experience. But sober-minded people ask: If the Germans helped the Russians, then why didn't the Germans help the Americans? It should be known that the American army seized the laboratory of a German scientific research institute and a chief designer of "V-2" rockets and took him to the United States, where he is now working on rocket manufacturing.

It is no secret that there is indeed a small group of Germans working here, and these people have either returned to Germany when their contracts expired or are about to return. When these experts returned home and told what they knew, the Americans predicted that they had sufficient information to know the level of Soviet rocket manufacturing. But when we launched the artificial satellite, the Americans began to shout: "We have been deceived again! The Germans who came to us didn't know what the Russians were doing at all. It seems that the Germans did not participate in the manufacture of the rocket."

Khrushchev said that in several of the most important fields of science, our country has surpassed the most highly developed capitalist country like the United States. The Soviet Union created and successfully launched the world's first artificial Earth satellites. Of course, this is far from the latest technology of Soviet science and technology and Soviet socialist industry. The whole world is surprised that the weight of the second artificial satellite is more than six times that of the first artificial satellite, reaching half a ton, but this is not the limit. We can double or even more than double the weight of the satellite, because the Soviet intercontinental rocket has enormous capabilities and can launch heavier satellites to higher altitudes. We can definitely do this!

**Soviet Rocket Weapons Can Inflict Devastating Blows on Aggressors**

Khrushchev said that at present, the imperialists are trying to intimidate the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, saying that they will establish atomic bases and rocket launch sites in the territories of NATO and other aggressive group member states. But they do not yet have rockets for these bases; they only want to manufacture such rockets in the future. That is to say, they will only be able to guarantee the rockets needed for these launch sites in two or three years. We already have such rockets today, and when the aggressors launch a new war, they can be launched to any corner of the earth and inflict devastating blows on the aggressors. Therefore, the imperialists cannot intimidate us. The Soviets cannot be frightened. War adventurers should think carefully about themselves.

**It is Impossible to Negotiate Using Coercive Language**

Khrushchev said that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is always harping on an old tune, saying that negotiations with the Soviet Union can only take place when the United States believes that its strength certainly exceeds that of the Soviet Union, that is, negotiations using ultimatums and coercive language. We have repeatedly pointed out that this is a foolish policy. The U.S. ruling clique always believed that they were stronger than us. We did not only have different views now. After the Soviet Union launched the artificial satellite, the whole world said that the Soviet Union had surpassed the United States in many scientific and technological fields. The Americans themselves had to admit: "Yes, we have been surpassed." The U.S. ruling clique now says: We should first catch up with the Soviet Union, and only when we are on par with the Soviet Union in scientific achievements can we sit down for negotiations. This policy is obviously untenable. It should be known that the Soviet Union will not stand still while others are planning to catch up with us. This approach by the imperialists will only lead to an endless arms race.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy in the past and at present. In order to safeguard world peace, the Soviet government has put forward new, concrete proposals on the issue of easing international tensions.

The Soviet Union proposed that a meeting of heads of state of some socialist and capitalist countries be held in the next two or three months to discuss the most important and urgent international issues. We believe that the meeting of heads of state must first focus attention on the most pressing issues in order to lay the foundation for the improvement of the overall international situation. Our position is precisely this: talks must be organized to discuss those issues that can already be resolved now, and such issues (including very important ones) do exist. The study of other issues can be postponed to later stages of the talks. Studying urgent international issues in a phased and step-by-step manner is the most realistic and wise approach.

**The Ruling Group in Western Countries Does Not Want to Ease Tensions**

However, regrettably, the ruling group in Western countries does not want to ease tensions, does not want to eliminate the "Cold War" and stop the expansion of armaments. On the contrary, they propose to first discuss those issues that are more difficult or even impossible to reach an agreement on, and they put forward these issues in a form close to ultimatums. This shows that not only do they not want to ease international tensions, but they are doing everything possible to intensify these tensions and make the war maniacs even more fanatical, so that they can easily take advantage of this tense situation and the people's fear of war to achieve their own enrichment goals.

Khrushchev mentioned that world public opinion and the governments of many countries welcomed the new peace proposals of the Soviet government. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Danish Prime Minister Hansen, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud, and the governments of some other countries affirmed the proposal to convene a high-level conference in their replies to the Soviet government, although these replies contained various opinions.

When talking about the attitude of Western leaders towards the Soviet government's proposals, Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. President, in his reply to the Soviet government's letter of December 10, 1957, expressed agreement with the Soviet government's proposal to convene a meeting of leaders of Eastern and Western countries. But he actually proposed that a foreign ministers' conference be held before the high-level conference to discuss international issues.

**International Talks Cannot Interfere in the Social System of Any Country**

Khrushchev pointed out that Eisenhower put forward two "guarantees" in his reply: First, the United States will never support any aggressive actions taken by any collective defense organization or its member states; Second, the United States will be ready to develop effective United Nations collective security measures at any time to replace regional collective defense measures. However, at the same time, he requested that the issue of the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe be discussed at the high-level meeting between the East and the West, as well as the issue of German reunification aimed at eliminating the German Democratic Republic. Khrushchev said, how can this approach put forward by the U.S. President be consistent with his guarantees?

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has stated its position on the issue of the European People's Democratic countries, where the people have freely chosen their own path of development, and on the issue of Germany, more than once. The U.S. President knows the Soviet government's views on these issues. So, what exactly do Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles hope for? It seems that they want to discuss how to eliminate the socialist system in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic system in the People's Democratic countries during talks with us. These gentlemen should be told that they have probably forgotten history. Now, when our people are reaping the fruits of the Soviet regime for forty years, the imperialist gentlemen want to make our people deviate from this only correct and tested road. However, gentlemen, times have changed, and your tone is also out of tune.

Khrushchev said that the issue of the national system of any country is the internal affair of the people of these countries. If some national leaders in Western countries want to raise the issue of the socialist system in the People's Democratic countries for discussion, then the representatives of socialist countries can confidently say that if this is the case, then shouldn't the following issue also be discussed: Can the imperialists rule in capitalist countries for a long time? Shouldn't they hand over power to the workers now? But in international talks, we have not raised and do not intend to raise the issue of the social system of a certain country for discussion, because this issue is a matter of how the people of each country want to decide for themselves. We insist on the position of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

Regarding the German issue, Khrushchev said that Eisenhower, ignoring all the statements made by the Soviet government on the German issue and disregarding the fact that there are two sovereign German states, once again demanded in his letter that "we should now step up our efforts to achieve the reunification of Germany through free elections in accordance with the agreement we have reached." But, as everyone knows, no such agreement has been reached at all!

**Supervision of the Use of Outer Space Can Only Be a Part of the Disarmament Issue**

Khrushchev then talked about another proposal put forward by Eisenhower in his reply to the Soviet government, that is, to ban the use of outer (interstellar) space for testing military rockets and to stop the production of weapons that need to use interstellar space. Khrushchev said that we say: Let us ban the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are all producing these weapons, and it is said that France will soon produce these weapons as well. An agreement could have been reached on banning the testing of these weapons on an equal footing. However, Western countries are obstructing the settlement of issues related to banning atomic and hydrogen weapons. They raised the issue of banning the use of outer (interstellar) space, which is actually banning intercontinental ballistic rockets. But, sorry, the Soviet Union has this kind of rocket, but Western countries do not. Therefore, the U.S. government wants to single out only one issue from the entire disarmament issue—the intercontinental rocket issue—while refusing to take any practical steps to ban weapons of mass destruction. The intention of this U.S. proposal is to ban weapons that can threaten U.S. territory, but to maintain all other types of weapons in their own hands that can threaten the whole world. That is to say, they want to ban what they do not have, while continuing to expand armaments as usual. Gentlemen, this is impossible.

Khrushchev said that, of course, the possibility of supervising the use of outer space cannot be denied, but when studying this issue, it must be seen as part of the entire disarmament issue, including the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons. If Western countries agree to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, agree to stop testing these weapons, and agree to remove the military bases used by the United States to surround the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, then, in order to consolidate peace and reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, the Soviet Union is also prepared to discuss the issue of intercontinental ballistic rockets.

**The Soviet Union is Ready to Participate in a High-Level Meeting of Heads of State at Any Time**

Khrushchev then spoke about the replies from British Prime Minister Macmillan, French Prime Minister Gaillard, Federal Republic of Germany Chancellor Adenauer, and many other heads of government to the Soviet government's proposals. He said that Macmillan agreed with the Soviet government's view that direct contact between the leaders of the Soviet Union and Western countries is beneficial. We hope that the British government will finally come to the conclusion that a meeting at the highest level should be convened first in order to solve the most pressing international problems. The Soviet government welcomes Macmillan's remarks on the conclusion of non-aggression treaties by the countries concerned. Regrettably, apparently due to the influence of some force, Macmillan later retreated somewhat from his original proposal.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet government believes that the necessity of convening a high-level meeting of heads of state is fully ripe. We are ready to participate in such a meeting at any time.

Does there currently exist a very clear issue that needs to be resolved immediately and can be resolved today? The answer can only be one: yes, not only does such an issue exist, but there are many. The Soviet government has officially informed all countries of its views on some of the issues that should be discussed first.

**The High-Level Conference Should Discuss Issues That Need to Be Resolved Urgently and Can Be Resolved**

Khrushchev cited some of the issues that should be discussed at the high-level conference. He said that the time is long overdue for discussing an agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing. Isn't it time to end the "Cold War"? It is long overdue. We should also talk about stopping war propaganda, and it should now be recognized that it is particularly dangerous to let this propaganda continue in the current situation. We also believe that the time has come to reach an agreement on reducing the number of foreign troops currently stationed in Germany and other European countries. At the same time, we say that reducing these troops is taking into account that this should only be a beginning, only the first stage, because, in the final analysis, all troops stationed in other countries must be completely withdrawn.

Life itself shows that it is necessary to solve such a major problem: establishing a zone free of any kind of nuclear weapons in Central Europe, including the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Some foreigners say that when solving the issue of establishing a nuclear-free zone in Europe, corresponding supervision must be established. The Soviet Union is prepared to study this proposal and establish the necessary supervision.

The situation in the Near East and the Middle East is an urgent issue. In recent years, this region has had dangerous sources of war erupting here and there, which have almost dragged all mankind into the abyss of war. Precisely because of this, we believe that it is the obligation of the major powers to reach an agreement as soon as possible on not using force and not interfering in the internal affairs of countries in this region in resolving the Middle East issue.

Finally, who can deny that it is necessary to end those strange phenomena in international economic relations, such as discrimination, various embargo lists, and similar artificial obstacles to trade between countries.

**In Order for the High-Level Conference to be Successful, the Status Quo Must be Acknowledged**

Khrushchev emphasized that it goes without saying that an agreement can be reached on many issues if both sides have a sincere desire. However, in order for the high-level conference to achieve positive results, the status quo must be acknowledged, the existence of two national systems in the world—the capitalist system and the socialist system—must be acknowledged, the principle of peaceful coexistence must be acknowledged, and non-interference in internal affairs must be acknowledged. If these are acknowledged, and if the ruling group in Western countries no longer wants to solve international problems by waging war against socialist countries, then an agreement on urgent international problems can be reached without much effort, which will be conducive to consolidating peace. If the status quo is not acknowledged, the socialist countries are ignored, their sovereignty is violated, and their internal affairs are interfered with, then of course no agreement can be reached. This policy is nothing but the "position of strength" policy, a policy of war. But this approach has already been tested in the fight against the Soviet Union, and, as everyone knows, those who are keen on this policy have been thoroughly defeated. At that time, the Soviet Union was still the only socialist country. Now, the Soviet Union is no longer the only socialist country. Standing shoulder to shoulder with it in the powerful socialist camp are the great People's Republic of China and all the socialist countries in Europe and Asia. This camp unites nearly one billion people. At this time, what can the imperialists still expect? Only madmen and adventurers will ignore this and expect to solve international problems through war. If the imperialists launch a new war, then those who launch the war will inevitably be destroyed. The people will forever end the system that brings countless suffering and bloody wars to mankind.

Khrushchev also said that the Soviet government is willing to study any issues aimed at consolidating peace and establishing broader international trust, and is willing to discuss these issues with the negotiating parties. Not long ago, Eisenhower made a proposal in a speech, believing that it is necessary for the Soviet Union and the United States to work together to prevent human disasters such as cancer, tuberculosis, and malaria. We believe that this proposal can be agreed upon. Many other issues can also be pointed out, such as the prevention and treatment of polio, locusts, glanders, and foot-and-mouth disease. However, Mr. President, please do not misunderstand me, I do not think that what the whole world expects is an agreement between the major powers on these issues. People of all countries are concerned with hope and anxiety about the solution of fundamental problems in international relations. They first expect to ease international tensions so that everyone is free from the threat of devastating wars. This is what we should consider first.

### 赫鲁晓夫重申苏联和平主张  召开高级会议时机完全成熟  已经有条件马上讨论停止核试验等迫切问题  美国要想赶过苏联的作法只能加剧军备竞赛

    赫鲁晓夫重申苏联和平主张
    召开高级会议时机完全成熟
    已经有条件马上讨论停止核试验等迫切问题
    美国要想赶过苏联的作法只能加剧军备竞赛
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫22日在白俄罗斯农业先进生产者会议上讲话时说，苏联政府认为，召开东西方国家高级会议的必要性已经完全成熟了。苏联随时都准备参加这种会议。
    赫鲁晓夫举例说，在高级会议上可以讨论的问题包括：立刻停止原子武器和氢武器的试验问题，停止“冷战”和停止战争宣传问题，裁减目前驻在德国和其他欧洲国家的外国军队的数量问题以及在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的问题，中近东局势问题，消除发展国际经济的障碍问题，等等。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们认为有条件在国家领导人的会议上马上讨论这些问题。我们并不排斥其他的重要问题，在国家领导人高级会议上也可以讨论其他的重要问题，并且就这些问题取得一定的、肯定的结果。”
    赫鲁晓夫在这次讲话中谈到了国际局势问题。他首先说，现在国际局势发生了很大的变化，同一年前比较，国际局势有了很大的改善。
    赫鲁晓夫说，1956年底，在匈牙利发生了众所周知的事件。在其他一些人民民主国家，首先是在波兰，也发生了一定的困难。反动的乌鸦得意忘形地啼叫，说什么共产主义的崩溃和危机开始了，说什么苏联和人民民主国家面临着无法克服的困难。西方国家侵略势力认为，有利的时机到来了，现在他们可以改变中近东的局势，巩固他们在那里的殖民主义地位。那时候，英、法和以色列三国政府发动了进攻埃及的军事冒险。但是，帝国主义者把赌注放在匈牙利反革命势力身上的这种算盘落空了。在苏联的援助下，只有三天功夫，匈牙利反革命匪徒就被击溃了，革命的秩序恢复了。自然，那里还存在着由于反革命的活动而造成的严重的经济困难，必须设法弥补法西斯暴乱分子给国家经济所造成的损失。
    在波兰人民共和国也还存在着不少困难，它正在采取措施来加强人民民主制度。最近我应哥穆尔卡同志和西伦凯维兹同志的邀请到波兰作了三天的访问，同波兰领导人进行了友好的会谈。经过这次会谈，我确信，以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党正确地利用自己的一切力量和可能，一定可以克服现有的困难，并且争取在发展国家的社会主义经济和提高人民福利方面取得新的成就。
    帝国主义对苏联的“预言”统统破产
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义者在对苏联、对我们社会主义制度的力量和巩固性方面所作的“预言”已经可耻地破产了。当我们批评我们农业中的缺点时，帝国主义者开始叫喊苏联农业“危机”，说什么布尔什维克现在无法“挣脱出来”。现在大家都看到，我们是怎样摆脱这个“危机”的。我们党使原定六年的增加畜牧业许多重要产品产量的计划在三年内胜利实现了。后来，我们提出改组工业和建筑业的管理工作的问题，资本主义者又开始叫喊，说苏联的工业部门工作不好，布尔什维克克服不掉工业发展中的困难。但是，半年过去，我们敌人的这些预言同样破产了。
    帝国主义者特别沉醉于这种想法，他们说社会主义制度不能促进科学和文化的发展，它束缚人的活动。但是，资产阶级的这种谎言已经完蛋了。突然，在苏联发射出一颗洲际弹道火箭。在洲际弹道火箭的基础上又发射出人造地球卫星。在两颗人造地球卫星发射出去之后，甚至那些顽固的怀疑主义者也再没有办法来就苏联科学、文化和技术的状况散布谎言了。
    苏联能够发射还要重得多的人造卫星
    但是，有些人竟瞎说，是德国人帮助俄国人创造了弹道火箭。他们说，俄国人俘掳了一批德国科学家和工程师，利用了他们的知识和经验。但是头脑清醒的人发问道：如果说德国人帮助了俄国人的话，那么为什么德国人没有帮助美国呢？要知道，美国军队夺去了德国科学研究所的实验室和一名“V—2”火箭总设计师，并且把他带到美国去，现在他正在美国研究制造火箭工作。
    这并不是什么秘密：在我们这里的确有一小批德国人在工作，这些人在同他们缔结的合同满期的时候或者已经返回德国，或者正要返回德国。当这些专家回国，并且讲述了他们所知道的事情以后，美国人便预料，他掌握了充分的情报，知道苏联在火箭制造方面处于怎样的水平。但是，当我们发射了人造卫星以后，美国人开始叫嚷：“我们又受骗了！到我们这里的德国人根本不知道俄国人做的事情。看来，德国人没有参与火箭的制造。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，在科学的若干最重要的领域方面，我国已经赶过了像美国这样最高度发达的资本主义国家。苏联造成了并且成功地发射了世界上第一批人造地球卫星。当然，这远远不算苏联科学技术和苏联社会主义工业的最新技术。全世界都感到惊奇的是：第二颗人造卫星的重量为第一颗人造卫星的六倍多，达到半吨重，然而这还不是极限。我们可以把卫星的重量再增加一倍，甚至一倍以上，因为苏联的洲际火箭有巨大的能力，可以把更重的卫星发射到更高的高度。这一点，我们一定可以做到！
  苏联的火箭武器能够给侵略者以毁灭性打击
    赫鲁晓夫说，目前帝国主义者企图恫吓苏联和其他爱好和平的国家，说他们将要在北大西洋公约组织和其他侵略集团成员国境内建立原子基地和火箭发射场。但是他们现在还没有这些基地用的火箭，只不过是想在将来制造这种火箭而已。这就是说，再过两三年他们才能够保证这些发射场所需要的火箭。我们今天已经具有这样的火箭，当侵略者一旦发动新战争时，它们就可以发射到地球上任何角落而给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。因此帝国主义者是恫吓不了我们的。苏联人是吓不倒的，战争冒险家还是好好考虑一下自己吧。
    企图用强迫的语言来谈判是行不通的
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国国务卿杜勒斯总是弹着一个老调，说只有当美国认为它的力量肯定地超过苏联时才可以同苏联谈判，也就是用最后通牒和强迫的语言进行谈判。我们不断地指出过，这是愚蠢的政策。美国统治集团总是认为他们比我们强。我们并不是只是在现在才有不同的看法。苏联发射人造卫星以后，全世界都说苏联在很多科学技术部门赶过了美国。美国人自己也不得不承认：“是的，我们被赶过了”。美国统治集团现在说：我们应该先赶上苏联，等我们在科学成就上同苏联并驾齐驱的时候，才可以坐下来谈判。这种政策显然是站不住脚的。要知道，苏联在别人打算赶上我们的时候也不会是停止不前的。帝国主义者这种作法只会引起永无休止的军备竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联在过去和现在都始终不渝地奉行爱好和平的外交政策。为了保障全世界和平，苏联政府就缓和国际紧张局势问题提出了新的具体建议。
    苏联建议在最近两三个月内召开一些社会主义国家和资本主义国家的国家领导人会议，来讨论最重大的和紧急的国际问题。我们认为必须使各国领导人的会议首先把注意力集中到最迫切的问题，以便为整个国际局势的好转奠定基础。我们的立场正是这样：必须组织会谈，讨论那些现在已经能够解决的问题，而这样一些问题（其中也包括很重要的问题）是存在的。对其他问题的研究可以推迟到会谈的稍后一些阶段。这样分阶段地、逐步地来研究迫切的国际问题是最现实的和明智的作法。
    西方国家统治集团不希望缓和紧张局势
    但是，遗憾的是，西方国家统治集团不希望缓和紧张局势、不希望消除“冷战”和停止扩充军备，反而提出要先讨论比较困难的甚至不可能达成协议的那些问题，而且它们是用近似最后通牒的形式提出这些问题的。这表明他们不仅不希望缓和国际紧张局势，而且尽一切力量使这种紧张局势更加剧烈，使战争狂更加狂热，以便很容易使他们利用这种紧张局势，利用人民对战争的恐惧心理来实现自己的致富目的。
    赫鲁晓夫提到，世界舆论和许多国家的政府都欢迎苏联政府的新的和平建议。印度总理尼赫鲁、丹麦首相汉森、阿富汗首相达乌德和其他一些国家的政府给苏联政府的复信中都肯定地对待召开高级会议的主张，虽然在这些复信中包含着各种意见。
    在谈到西方国家领导人对苏联政府建议的态度的时候，赫鲁晓夫指出，美国总统在对苏联政府1957年12月10日的信件所发出的复信里表示同意苏联政府提出的召开东西方国家领导人会议的建议。可是他实际上提出在高级会议之前先举行外长会议来讨论国际问题的建议。
    国际会谈不能干预任何国家的社会制度
    赫鲁晓夫指出，艾森豪威尔在他的回信中提出了两点“保证”：一、美国决不会支持任何集体防御组织或其成员国所采取的任何侵略行动；二、美国将随时准备着手发展有效的联合国集体安全措施，以代替区域性的集体防御措施。可是，他在信中同时却要求在东西方高级会议上讨论东欧人民民主国家的问题，以及讨论旨在消灭德意志民主共和国的德国统一问题。赫鲁晓夫说，美国总统提出的这种作法怎能够同他的保证相吻合呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说，关于人民已经自由地选择了自己的发展道路的欧洲人民民主国家的问题以及德国的问题，苏联曾经不止一次地阐明过自己的立场。美国总统是知道苏联政府对这些问题的观点的。那么，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯先生所希望的究竟是什么呢？看来，他们是想在同我们会谈时讨论如何消灭苏联的社会主义制度和人民民主国家的人民民主制度。应当告诉这些先生们，他们大概忘记了历史。现在，当我国人民正在收获苏维埃政权四十年来的胜利果实的时候，帝国主义者先生们却想使我国人民离开这条唯一正确的经过考验的道路。然而，先生们，时代不同了，你们的调子也不对头。
    赫鲁晓夫说，任何一个国家的国家制度问题都是这些国家的人民的内政。如果西方国家某些国家领导人要把人民民主国家的社会主义制度问题提出来讨论，那么社会主义国家的代表可以理直气壮地说，如果这样，那末下面一个问题是不是也应该讨论讨论，即帝国主义者能否长久在资本主义国家统治下去，难道他们现在不应当把政权让给劳动者么？但是在国际会谈中我们没有提出，也不打算提出某个国家的社会制度的问题来加以讨论，因为这个问题是各国人民自己愿意怎样决定就怎样决定的问题。我们坚持不干涉他国内政的立场。
    关于德国问题，赫鲁晓夫说，艾森豪威尔不顾苏联政府就德国问题所提出的一切声明，并且无视存在着两个主权德国的事实，在他的信中再一次要求“我们现在应当加紧努力，根据我们曾经达成的协议通过自由选举以实现德国的重新统一”。但是，大家知道，根本没有达成过这种协议！
  监督对宇宙空间利用只能是裁军问题一部分
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了艾森豪威尔在他给苏联政府的复信中提出的另一个建议，即要求禁止利用宇宙（星际）空间来试验军用火箭以及停止生产要利用星际空间的那种武器。赫鲁晓夫说，我们说：让我们禁止试验原子武器和氢武器吧。美国、英国、苏联都在生产这种武器，据说，法国不久也要生产这种武器了。在平等基础上本可就禁止试验这种武器达成协议。可是西方国家阻挠解决有关禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题。他们提出禁止利用宇宙（星际）空间问题，其实也就是禁止洲际弹道火箭。但是，对不起，苏联有这种火箭，而西方国家没有这种火箭。因此美国政府想从整个裁军问题中仅仅揪出一个问题——洲际火箭问题，同时却不愿作出任何实际的步骤来禁止大规模毁灭性的武器。美国这个建议的用意是：禁止那种能够威胁美国领土的武器，但是又要保持自己手中的能够威胁全世界的所有其他类型的武器。也就是说，他们要禁止的是他们自己所没有的东西，而扩充军备他们是照旧进行。先生们，这是办不到的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当然，不能否定关于监督对宇宙空间的利用的问题的可能性，但是在研究这个问题时必须把它看作是包括禁止原子武器和氢武器问题在内的整个裁军问题的一部分。如果西方国家同意禁止原子武器和氢武器，同意停止试验这些武器，同意撤除美国用来包围苏联和其他社会主义国家的军事基地，那么，苏联为了巩固和平和就裁军问题达成协议，也准备讨论关于洲际弹道火箭的问题。
    苏联随时准备参加国家领导人高级会议
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到英国首相麦克米伦、法国总理盖伊阿、德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳和许多其他国家政府首脑对于苏联政府建议的回信。他说，麦克米伦同意苏联政府的看法，即苏联和西方国家领导人进行直接接触是有益的。我们希望，英国政府最后能得出这样的结论：为了解决当前最迫切的国际问题，首先应该召开最高级会议。苏联政府对麦克米伦关于有关国家缔结互不侵犯条约的言论表示欢迎。遗憾的是，显然由于某种力量的影响，麦克米伦后来又从他原来的建议有所后退。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联政府认为，召开有政府首脑参加的国家领导人高级会议的必要性已完全成熟了。我们随时准备参加这种会议。
    目前是否存在有那种需要立即解决，而今天又可以解决的非常明确的问题呢？答案只能有一个：有，这种问题不仅有，而且还不少。苏联政府已经把它对一些首先应当加以讨论的问题的看法正式告知所有国家。
  高级会议应讨论急需解决而又可以解决的问题
    赫鲁晓夫举出了一些应该在高级会议上讨论的问题。他说，就立刻停止原子武器和氢武器试验达成协议的问题进行讨论的时机早就成熟了。难道还不是结束“冷战”的时候吗？早就是时候了。也应该谈谈关于停止战争宣传的问题，现在应该认识到：这种宣传如果在目前的情况下让它继续下去，那是特别危险的事情。我们还认为，达成关于裁减目前驻在德国以及其他欧洲国家境内的外国军队数量的协议的时机已经到来。同时，我们说裁减这些军队，是考虑到，这仅仅应该是一个开端，只是第一阶段，因为，归根到底驻在别国境内的一切军队都要全部撤离。
    生活本身表明，有必要解决这样一个重大问题：在中欧建立包括德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志联邦共和国的无任何种类的核武器的地区。某些外国人士说，解决关于在欧洲建立无原子武器和氢武器地区的问题时，必须建立相应的监督。苏联准备研究这一建议和建立必要的监督。
    近东和中东的局势问题是一个迫切的问题。近几年来，这一地区时而在这里，时而在那里产生危险的战争策源地，它们险些把全人类卷进战争的深渊。正因为这样，我们认为，尽快地就在解决中近东问题上不采取武力和不干涉这一地区国家的内政达成协议是大国的义务。
    最后，有谁能否认必须结束那些国际经济关系方面的怪现象，如歧视、各种禁运货单以及与此类似的各国通商中的人为障碍呢。要想使高级会议获得成果必须承认现状
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，不言而喻，在双方都具有真诚愿望的情况下，可以就许多问题达成协议。但是，要想使高级会议获得肯定的成果，就必须承认现状，承认世界上存在着两种国家体系——资本主义体系和社会主义体系，承认和平共处的原则，不干涉他国内政。如果这些都被承认，并且如果西方国家统治集团不再想用对社会主义国家进行战争的办法来解决国际问题的话，那末，不费什么力便可以就迫切的国际问题达成协议，以有利于巩固和平了。如果不承认现状，无视社会主义国家，侵犯他们的主权、干涉他们的内政，那时当然就不能达成协议。这种政策不是什么别的，正是“实力地位”政策，是战争政策。但这种办法在反对苏联的时候就已经试验过了，正如大家所知道的那样，热中于这种政策的人遭到了彻底的失败。那时苏联还是唯一的社会主义国家。现在，苏联已不是唯一的社会主义国家了，和它并肩屹立在强大的社会主义阵营中的有伟大的中华人民共和国和欧亚两洲所有的社会主义国家，在这个阵营里团结了将近十亿人民，在这个时候，帝国主义者还能指望什么。只有疯子和冒险家才会忽视这一点，指望通过战争的办法可以解决国际问题。如果帝国主义者发动新战争，那末发动战争的人必然遭到毁灭。人民将永世地结束那种给人类带来无数痛苦和流血战争的制度。
    赫鲁晓夫还说，苏联政府愿意研究任何旨在巩固和平和建立更广泛的国际信任的问题，愿意同谈判对方讨论这些问题。不久以前艾森豪威尔在一篇演说中曾提出一种主张，认为苏联和美国有必要协力防治癌症、结核病、疟疾等的人类的灾难。我们认为这种主张是可以同意的。还可以指出许多其他问题，比如防治小儿麻痹症、蝗虫、鼻疽、口蹄疫等。但是，总统先生，请你不要领会错我的意思，我认为全人类所期待的并不是大国之间就这些问题达成协议。各国人民怀着希望和不安的心情关切着国际关系中根本问题的解决。他们首先期望缓和国际紧张局势，使大家不受毁灭性战争的威胁。这一点是我们应该首先考虑的。
