Frugal Housekeeping, Surplus Every Month

    Zhang Yufen, a housewife living on Xiaoshulin Street in Tianjin, is very good at managing her household. Her husband is a salesperson at a Chinese medicine store with a monthly income of 49 yuan, supporting a family of four. Since 1955, she has been able to deposit 15 to 20 yuan in the bank every month. This is the result of Zhang Yufen's careful planning and frugal housekeeping. Besides buying necessary items for the family with her savings, she is also enthusiastic about purchasing national construction bonds. In the three years of 1955, 1956 and 1957 alone, she bought 120 yuan worth of bonds. When the 1958 bonds were issued recently, they bought another 50 yuan.

    Zhang Yufen deposits the money left over from her planned living expenses into the savings bank.

    Zhang Yufen and her husband make a family expense plan together every month. When the state issued the 1958 bonds, after making a good family expense plan, she and her husband discussed and decided to buy another 50 yuan of 1958 bonds.

    勤俭持家　月月有余
    住在天津市小树林街的家庭妇女张玉芬很会过日子。她的爱人是一个中药店的售货员，每月收入四十九元，总共要养活四口之家，但从1955年以来，每月都能向银行存款十五到二十元。这是张玉芬生活开支精打细算勤俭持家的结果，她省下的存款除了添置家庭必要的东西外，还很热心购买国家建设公债，仅1955、1956、1957三年就买了公债一百二十元。最近发行1958年的公债，他们又买了五十元。　新华社记者　梁一丁摄
    张玉芬把生活开支计划以外的余钱存入储蓄所。
    张玉芬每月都和爱人一起作出家庭开支计划。在国家发行1958年公债的时候，他们作好家庭开支计划以后，她又和爱人商量再认购1958年公债五十元。
