Xinhua News Agency Report: According to the New Jiangsu Daily, the large-scale schistosomiasis prevention and control movement centered on snail eradication in winter in Jiangsu Province has been fully launched in forty counties in the Yangzhou, Suzhou, Songjiang, Yancheng, and Zhenjiang Special Districts, as well as in eight cities including Nanjing and Changzhou. The masses in these areas have launched a decisive siege against the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, the Oncomelania hupensis snail. Currently, the area where snails have been eradicated has reached 12.08 million square meters, exceeding the original snail eradication plan by 33.6%. 145 townships and communes have emerged as basically snail-free, and 110 townships and communes and 103 production teams are close to basically eliminating snails. In twelve counties and cities, including Gaoyou, Shanghai, Jiangyin, Zhenze, and Yangzhou, the snail eradication area has reached over 40%-60% of the snail-infested area. The Party committees in these areas are determined to completely eliminate snails this year.

While carrying out large-scale snail eradication movements, various localities have also combined it with increasing the accumulation of household fertilizer and carrying out patriotic health campaigns, rectifying and consolidating manure management work. They have also organized medical personnel to go deep into the countryside to arrange for patients based on production tasks and labor planning, and to carry out treatment work in a planned manner.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the schistosomiasis prevention and control movement. The Party committees of Songjiang, Wuxi, Jiangdu, and other counties have decided that the leading groups for schistosomiasis prevention and control movements in districts, townships, and communes should be headed by a secretary. In snail eradication, the prevention and control departments have also paid attention to standards, quality, and technical guidance, which has improved the quality of snail eradication work. In areas where complete eradication can be achieved in one go, the requirements for complete eradication in one go have been met.

This prevention and control movement is closely integrated with the production movement. The Yangzhou Special District has established a line of battle organizations from top to bottom for five major movements: water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, greening, schistosomiasis prevention and control, and livestock protection, ensuring unified command organizationally and unified arrangements in tasks. In terms of work methods, it has basically been achieved that wherever water conservancy is carried out, snail eradication is carried out; wherever dry riverbeds are used for fertilizer accumulation, snail eradication is also carried out. The three tasks of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and snail eradication not only proceed simultaneously, but also promote each other. For example, in Yongju Cooperative, Yongan Township, Jiangdu County, in conjunction with the dredging and widening of a three-li-long river channel, the snails in a 1,500-meter-long area were completely eradicated, ensuring the irrigation of more than 2,000 mu of fields, and more than 9,000 dan of river mud were accumulated. More than 300 mu of fields can be improved. The masses generally reflect: This approach achieves five gains at once (water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, snail eradication, catching fish, and eliminating pests).

Xinhua News Agency Report: According to the Hubei Daily, a vigorous schistosomiasis prevention and control movement has been launched in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent in Hubei Province.

Last winter, snails were eliminated on more than 170 million square meters of land in Hubei Province, and more than 47,000 schistosomiasis patients underwent treatment. Various localities have also carried out manure management work in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation to kill schistosomiasis eggs.

The masses' enthusiasm for snail eradication is extremely high. In the Huanggang Special District, 160,000 people participated in snail eradication, and the area where snails have been eradicated has exceeded the total snail eradication area in 1956 and the first three quarters of 1957 by more than four times. Through last winter's concentrated snail eradication movement, Daye County has basically eliminated snails, making it the third snail-free county in Hubei Province after Gucheng and Xiangyang basically eliminated snails. In Tianmen County, fourteen cooperatives have basically eliminated snails. The Party committees of Xiangyang, Gucheng, Nanzhang, and other three counties in the Xiangyang Special District also re-eradicated snails once on the land where snails had been eliminated last year. The Party committees of each county in this special district have stated that they will strive to eliminate snails and treat all patients within 1958. Tongshan, Yuan'an, Dangyang, Nanzhang, and other counties plan to become basically "snail-free counties" before the Spring Festival.

    江苏湖北决心根绝血吸虫病
    全面彻底除尽钉螺
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：江苏省冬季以灭螺为中心的大规模血吸虫病防治运动，已在扬州、苏州、松江、盐城、镇江专区的四十个县和南京、常州等八个市全面展开。这些地方的群众，向血吸虫中间宿主钉螺展开了歼灭性围剿。目前，灭螺面积已达一千二百零八万平方公尺，超出原定灭螺计划的33.6％，并涌现出一百四十五个基本无螺乡、社，有一百一十个乡、社和一百零三个生产队已接近基本消灭钉螺。高邮、上海、江阴、震泽、扬州等十二个县市的灭螺面积已达有螺面积的40％—60％以上，这些地区的党委决心在今年彻底消灭钉螺。
    在进行大规模灭螺运动的同时，各地还结合增积家庭肥料和开展爱国卫生运动，整顿和巩固了粪便管理工作，并组织医务人员深入农村，根据生产任务和劳力规划，安排病人，有计划地开展治疗工作。
    各级党委对血吸虫病防治运动的领导极为重视。松江、无锡、江都等县的党委决定区、乡、社血吸虫病防治运动领导小组都由一位书记任组长。在灭螺中，防治部门还重视了规格质量和技术指导，使灭螺工作的质量有了提高，在可以达到一次灭光的地区，已达到一次灭光的要求。
    这次防治运动与生产运动紧密地结合起来。扬州专区从上而下建立了水利、积肥、绿化、血吸虫病防治、保畜五大运动一条线的战斗组织，从组织上保证了统一指挥，从任务上保证了统一安排。在工作做法上，基本上做到了兴修水利到哪里，灭螺就灭到哪里；干河积肥到哪里，灭螺也就灭到哪里，水利、积肥、灭螺三项工作不仅同时并进，而且相互起了推动作用。如江都县永安乡永巨社在三里路长的一条河道上，结合水利工程的浚深拓宽，将一千五百公尺长的地区的钉螺全部灭光，保证了二千多亩田的灌溉，还干河积河泥九千多担。可垭田三百多亩。群众普遍反映：这种做法一举五得（水利、积肥、灭螺、捉鱼、驱虫害）。
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：湖北省血吸虫病流行地区，掀起了一个声势浩大的防治血吸虫病运动。
    去年冬天，湖北全省有一亿七千多万平方公尺的土地面积上消灭了钉螺，有四万七千多个血吸虫病患者经过了治疗。各地还结合积肥，开展管理粪便的工作，以杀灭血吸虫卵。
    群众灭螺的情绪极为高涨。黄冈专区有十六万人参加灭螺，已灭螺面积超过1956年和1957年前三个季度灭螺面积总和的四倍多。大冶县经过去冬突击灭螺运动，已基本上消灭了钉螺，这是湖北省继谷城、襄阳基本消灭了钉螺后的第三个无螺县。天门县已有十四个社基本上消灭了钉螺。襄阳专区襄阳、谷城、南漳等三县还在去年已消灭了钉螺的土地上覆灭了一次。这个专区各县党委表示，争取在1958年内消灭钉螺，治完病人。通山、远安、当阳、南漳等县计划在春节前成为基本“无螺县”。
