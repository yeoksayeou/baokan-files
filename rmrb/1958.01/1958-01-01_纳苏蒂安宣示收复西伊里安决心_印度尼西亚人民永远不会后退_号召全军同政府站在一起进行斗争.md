Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 31st. Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution appealed to all army personnel on December 31st to stand with the country's leadership in 1958 and fight for the recovery of West Irian.

In his New Year's address to the entire army, Nasution said that the government has made it clear that in the new stage of the struggle to recover West Irian, which has already begun, the Indonesian people will never retreat.

Nasution said that 1957 was a year of severe trials for Indonesia, and 1958 will be even more serious as a result of the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Indonesia faces intensified attacks from home and abroad in political, economic and military terms, and may even encounter psychological warfare. He said that the Indonesian military bears the primary responsibility for defending the security of the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 31st. The Jakarta military authorities formally took control of twenty Dutch enterprises on December 31st.

Since the Jakarta military authorities announced the control of all Dutch enterprises, a total of forty-three enterprises have been formally controlled. There are currently six other Dutch enterprises awaiting transfer of control.

In each enterprise under control, there is a supervisory committee composed of representatives and experts from the military authorities, the police authorities, and Indonesian workers to supervise all business activities of the enterprise. The Dutch managers and general Dutch employees of these enterprises also continue to work under supervision.

According to Antara News Agency, the Bank of Indonesia will dismiss all Dutch personnel from January 1, 1958, and replace them with Indonesians. The bank's original plan was to complete the replacement of Dutch personnel with Indonesian personnel in 1960.

Antara News Agency quoted sources from the Bank of Indonesia as saying that there were no difficulties in replacing Dutch personnel. The Bank of Indonesia is also preparing to open a branch in Jember, East Java, around January 25, 1958.

    号召全军同政府站在一起进行斗争
    新华社雅加达31日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安12月31日号召全军人员在1958年同国家的领导站在一起，进行争取收复西伊里安的斗争。
    纳苏蒂安在他向全军发布的新年祝词中说，政府已经明白表示，在已经开始的争取收复西伊里安的斗争的新阶段中，印度尼西亚人民永远不会后退。
    纳苏蒂安说，1957年是印度尼西亚经受严重考验的一年，由于印度尼西亚同荷兰之间发生争执的结果，1958年将更加严重。印度尼西亚在政治、经济和军事方面面对着来自国内外的加紧的攻击，甚至会遇到神经战。他说，印度尼西亚的军人在保卫国家的安全上负有主要的责任。
    新华社雅加达31日电　雅加达军事当局在12月31日正式管制了二十家荷兰企业。
    自从雅加达军事当局宣布管制所有荷兰企业以来，已被正式管制的企业共有四十三家。目前还有六家荷兰企业听候移交管制。
    在受管制的每一企业中，都有由军事当局、警察当局和印度尼西亚工人的代表和专家组成的监督委员会，来监督企业的一切业务活动，这些企业的荷兰管理人员和一般荷兰雇员也在监督之下继续工作。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚银行将从1958年1月1日起解除全部荷兰人员的职务，由印度尼西亚人接替。这家银行的原订计划是要在1960年完成印度尼西亚人员接替荷兰人员的工作的。
    安塔拉通讯社引述印度尼西亚银行人士的话说，接替荷兰人员的工作并没有遇到任何困难。印度尼西亚银行还准备在1958年1月25日左右在东爪哇的任抹开设一家分行。
