The Secret of "A Group of Bachelors"
Li Lü

The sky was just beginning to lighten, with only a few scattered stars remaining. A cluster of people was crowded in front of the honor roll. I squeezed in to take a look and saw it was a big-character poster with the title "We Want Money, Not Stoves." Below it said, "Our heating allowance should be given to us. Those with families all received money, why discriminate against us bachelors?" It was signed "A Group of Bachelors."

These past few days, several young apprentices in our single dormitory have been discussing the heating allowance. Because they received more than ten yuan when they first entered the factory last year, they have been planning on this money for a long time. However, last year, most people spent the money casually after it was issued, and when it snowed, they had no money to start a stove for warmth. When it got dark, they would burrow into their quilts. Some would even burn a few pieces of wood, making the air suffocating. They complained that the leadership did not care about their lives. I remember when Secretary Li of the Youth League Committee came to our dormitory last year and asked, "Are you cold? You've spent all your money and haven't even started a fire!" He touched the quilt and said, "You young people don't have families yet and only care about playing. You don't know how to take care of yourselves." Because everyone was young, no one had ever managed a household, and no one cared about building a stove or buying coal briquettes. Therefore, this year, the welfare department ordered stoves in advance, made chimneys, and solved the heating problem first.

After this big-character poster was put up, many comrades discussed it. In the evening, five or six more were posted, some refuting "A Group of Bachelors," saying, "This group of bachelors should be renamed 'Money-Grubbing Bachelors.' Can money give off warmth?" Others agreed with and supported "A Group of Bachelors."

The rectification leadership team decided to hold a discussion meeting on this issue, and the welfare department wrote a notice. People arrived one after another in the evening. I wondered curiously, "How many people are in this 'group of bachelors'?" Before long, everyone had arrived. The head of the welfare department first explained the situation and then asked everyone to discuss it. As soon as he finished speaking, Li Xiaoming, who was sitting to my right, suddenly stood up, confidently saying, "I have an opinion about starting a stove. Starting a stove is smoky, dirty, and there is a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. This money is ours and should be handled by ourselves." As soon as he sat down, Chen Shenggen, who was sitting against the wall, said angrily, "What Xiaoli said is right. It is right to give us the money. No one else can interfere with this. Does the welfare department intend to make money off us by doing this? During the rectification period, they are still committing bureaucracy. I think not starting a stove can also save coal for the country."

"Smoky and dirty? Last year you picked up some wood from outside to burn, wasn't that smoky and dirty?" The speaker was the tall Zhang Bi. Obviously, he disagreed with the above two comrades' speeches. When he mentioned the wood picking, Li Xiaoming's face turned red. It turned out that last year, Xiao Li burned his cotton shoes while picking up wood to burn, and he was criticized in the workshop's blackboard newspaper. So when Zhang Bi mentioned the wood picking, Xiao Li felt embarrassed.

"Since it's to save for the country, why ask for money?" Zhao Liangchen said unconvincingly, "If it's to save for the country, I suggest donating this heating allowance to the farmers in the disaster area." After he finished speaking, several other people wanted to speak, and the meeting became chaotic. The head of the welfare department waved his hand at everyone, and the meeting slowly calmed down. He said to everyone in a tone of resolution, "There are now two opinions on this issue. One is not to start a stove and issue the heating allowance, and the other is to start a stove and not issue the heating allowance, or to use the money to support the people in the disaster area. These opinions cannot be unified, so we will seek the opinion of the majority. Now, raise your hands if you disagree with starting a stove and want to receive money." As soon as he finished speaking, Chen Shenggen quickly raised his right hand straight up. Li Xiaoming moved his arm, looked around hesitantly, and finally lazily raised it. After the head of the welfare department looked at it, he said, "Two." Then it was decided to start the stove. However, there are still two issues to explain to everyone: We will install chimneys on all the stoves. If everyone pays attention, they will not get carbon monoxide poisoning. Regarding making money, we will not do that. A stove and a few sections of chimney cost nearly twenty yuan, plus coal, there is no way to make a profit. As he said this, he looked around, and seeing that there were no objections, he announced the adjournment of the meeting. It was then that I realized that the so-called "group of bachelors" was only two people.

    “一群单身汉”的秘密
    李履
    天刚麻麻亮，天上还有几颗疏星，光荣榜前挤了一疙瘩人，我也挤进去看看，原来是一张大字报，题目是“我们要钱，不要炉子”，下面是“我们的烤火费应该发给我们，有家属的都发了钱，为什么专来克扣我们单身汉呢？”下面的署名是“一群单身汉”。
    这几天我们单人宿舍有几个青年徒工在议论烤火费。因为他们去年进厂，首先发了十多元，所以今年老早就打算着这笔钱。可是去年把钱一发下去，大部分都随便的花掉了，等到下雪天，都没钱生炉子取暖。黑了天，便钻到被窝里去，有的还拣几块木头烧一下，把人烟的透不过气来；还埋怨领导不关心大家的生活。记得去年团委李书记到我们宿舍来时就问：“你们冷不冷？钱都花掉了，连个火也不生！”他摸着被子说：“你们这些年轻人，都还没有个家，只顾玩，不会照顾自己”。因为大家都年轻，谁也没料理过家务，至于砌炉子，买煤球，更没人来管。因此，今年福利科提前订了炉子，作好烟囱，先解决这个烤火问题。
    这张大字报贴出去，很多同志就在议论，晚上又接着贴了五六张，有的是反驳“一群单身汉”说：“这群单身汉，不如改名财迷汉，钱能放出暖气吗？”有的同意和支持“一群单身汉”。
    整风领导小组决定关于这问题开个座谈会讨论，由福利科写了通知。晚上人陆续的到了。我好奇的想：“这一群单身汉有多少人呢？”没好久人到齐了，福利科长先讲一下情况后，便让大家讨论。他刚一讲完，坐在我右边的李小明忽的站起来，胸有成竹的说：“生炉子我有意见，生炉子既有烟又脏，还有中煤毒的危险，这笔钱是我们的，应由我们自己处理。”他刚一坐下，坐在靠墙的陈生根很气愤的说：“小李说的对，把钱发给我们是应该的，这事别人管不了的，难道福利科这样作还打算赚我们的钱吗？在整风时期还犯官僚主义，我看不生炉子又能给国家节约煤。”
    “有烟又脏，去年你从外边拣些木材来烧，那没烟不脏吗？”发言的是大个子张璧，显然他不同意以上两同志的发言。他一提到拣木材的事，可就把李小明的脸说红了。原来去年小李因为拣木材烧火，把棉鞋烧着了，还受了车间黑板报批评，所以张璧一提起拣木材的事，小李便有些不好意思。
    “既然为国家节约，为什么要钱呢？”赵良臣很不服气的说：“如果为国家节约，我建议把这笔烤火费捐献给灾区农民。”他说完又有几个人要发言，会场比较乱，福利科长向大家摆摆手，会场慢慢平息下来，他带着解决的口吻向大家说：“这个问题现在有两方面的意见，一方面是不生炉子发烤火费，另一方面是生炉子不发烤火费，或把钱支援灾区人民；这些意见不能统一，还是征求多数的意见。现在不同意生炉子，要发钱的举手。”这话刚说完，陈生根刷的一下，把右手举得笔直。李小明胳膊动了一下，向四周看看犹豫了一下，终于懒洋洋的举起了。福利科长看了以后说“两个”，那就确定生炉子了，不过还有两个问题向大家交代一下：这个炉子我们都装上烟囱，如果大家注意点，不会中煤毒的。关于赚钱，我们不会这样作的，一个炉子和几节烟囱就将近二十元，再加上煤，并无可赚。他说到这里，向四周环视了一下，看着都没有异议，就宣布散会了。这时我才知道，所谓“一群单身汉”，仅只就两个人。
