    The Soviet Union Again Reduces Troops by 300,000
    By Our Staff Commentator

    The Soviet government has decided to again reduce its armed forces by 300,000, including more than 41,000 troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic and more than 17,000 troops stationed in Hungary. This is another major step taken by the Soviet government in the recent period to ease international tensions after a series of efforts.

    The Peace Manifesto of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, published last November, pointed out: "We must use our joint forces to rid the people of the burden of armaments. We must save the world from the threat of war, death and destruction." In accordance with this lofty spirit, the Soviet Union has repeatedly demonstrated to the world its sincere desire to achieve peaceful coexistence between the two systems over the past two months. The letters from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin to the heads of state of various countries, the notes from the Soviet government to the member states of the United Nations, and the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have repeatedly put forward various proposals for stopping the arms race and implementing peaceful coexistence. These Soviet proposals have given new encouragement and hope to peace-loving people all over the world. The voices in Western countries calling for talks between East and West and for a halt to the arms race are growing louder and louder, forming such a huge force that the plans of American monopoly capitalists to incite a nuclear arms race have not yet succeeded. Over the past two months, there has been chaos in the Western camp. Adenauer demanded negotiations with the Soviet Union first, and Macmillan threatened to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union later. The countries of the North Atlantic Group are all busy drafting replies to Bulganin's letters. Of course, all this cannot be affirmed at face value. The crux of the matter is that Western countries must take practical action.

    Now, the Soviet Union has taken action again. The Soviet government, in accordance with the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet, has made a new decision to reduce its troops. It has also decided to use the funds freed up by this reduction of armed forces and military expenditures for peaceful construction and to further improve the material and cultural life of the Soviet people.

    This is the third large-scale reduction of troops by the Soviet Union in the past two years or more. The Soviet Union first reduced its armed forces in 1955, when a total of 640,000 people were cut. At that time, it was shortly after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, and the international situation had eased somewhat. This decision by the Soviet Union played a positive role in further easing international tensions and building trust between major powers.

    On May 14, 1956, the Soviet Union announced for the second time a reduction of its armed forces by 1.2 million people, dissolving 63 divisions and independent brigades, and decommissioning 375 warships. Together with the Soviet Union's third troop reduction, the number of armed forces reduced by the Soviet Union since 1955 has reached a total of 2.14 million.

    The Soviet Union's repeated implementation of disarmament demonstrates the Soviet Union's sincere efforts to break the deadlock in disarmament negotiations caused by American obstruction, and to reach an international disarmament agreement.

    Dulles once said that the Soviet Union's disarmament makes demobilized soldiers "manufacture military power in factories, perhaps more threatening than when they are permanently stationed in the army." According to Dulles' absurd logic, it seems that disarmament is more "threatening" to world peace than non-disarmament. Well, even if Dulles' logic is reasonable, if disarmament is really more threatening than non-disarmament, why does Dulles, who has always advocated "deterrent power," dare not reduce the armed forces of the United States in the same way as the Soviet Union? Now is the time for the West to take action, if they really hope for world peace as they say they do.

    苏联再次裁军三十万
    本报评论员
    苏联政府决定再次裁减武装部队三十万人，其中包括驻在德意志民主共和国的军队四万一千人和驻在匈牙利的军队一万七千人以上。这是苏联政府最近时期为缓和国际局势而采取的一系列的努力之后的又一重大步骤。
    去年11月发表的各国共产党和工人党和平宣言指出：“我们要用共同的力量来摆脱压在人民肩上的军备负担。我们要使世界免受战争、死亡和毁灭的威胁。”根据这种崇高的精神，两个月来，苏联向全世界一再表明自己竭诚实现两个制度和平共处的愿望。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给各国首脑的信和苏联政府给联合国会员国的照会，以及苏联最高苏维埃决议，反复提出了停止军备竞赛、实行和平共处的各项建议。苏联这些建议，给予全世界爱好和平的人们以新的鼓舞和希望。西方国家中要求东西方举行会谈和停止军备竞赛的呼声越来越大，形成了如此巨大的力量，使得美国垄断资本家们妄想煽起核备战的计划迄未得逞。两个月来，西方阵营中呈现了一片混乱，阿登纳要求同苏联谈判于先，麦克米伦扬言同苏联签订互不侵犯条约于后。北大西洋集团的各国，正都在各自忙着起草对于布尔加宁信件的复信。当然，所有这一切，不能按其表面价值来加以肯定。问题的症结在于西方国家必须作出实际的行动来。
    现在，苏联又一次采取行动了。苏联政府遵照着最高苏维埃会议的决议，又作出了新的裁减军队的决定。并决定要把由于这次裁减武装部队和削减军费而腾出来的经费用于和平建设和用来进一步改善苏联人民的物质和文化生活。
    这是苏联在最近两年多期间的第三次大量裁军。苏联第一次裁减武装部队是在1955年，那次一共裁减了六十四万人。当时，正是日内瓦四国政府首脑会议举行后不久，国际局势有了一些缓和。苏联的这一决定，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立大国之间的信任起了积极的作用。
    在1956年5月14日苏联第二次宣布裁减武装部队一百二十万人，为此解散了六十三个师和独立旅，并把三百七十五艘军舰停止使用。连同苏联第三次裁减的军队，从1955年以来苏联裁减武装部队人数已共达二百一十四万人。
    苏联一再实行裁军，表明了苏联争取打破由于美国阻挠而造成的裁军谈判僵局，进而达成国际裁军协议的真诚努力。
    杜勒斯曾经说过，苏联裁军使复员军人“在工厂里制造的军事力量，也许比他们常驻在军队里的情况下更加有威胁性”。按照杜勒斯的荒谬逻辑，似乎裁军比不裁军更要“威胁”世界和平。好罢，就算杜勒斯的逻辑是合理的罢，如果裁军真的比不裁军具有更大的威胁性，为什么向来鼓吹“威慑力量”的杜勒斯不敢照苏联这样裁减美国的武装部队呢？现在是西方采取行动的时候了，如果他们果真像他们嘴里说的那样是希望世界和平的话。
