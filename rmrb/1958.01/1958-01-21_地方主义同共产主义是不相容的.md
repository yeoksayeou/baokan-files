Localism is Incompatible with Communism
--Zhejiang Daily Editorial, January 7--

One of the significant achievements of the Second Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Zhejiang Provincial Committee's Second Session was the earnest criticism of localistic tendencies existing within the Party. Resolving this issue is of great significance for strengthening the unity and solidarity of the provincial Party organization under the leadership of the Party Central Committee.

Since liberation, the Party Central Committee has dispatched a large number of cadres from the old liberated areas to Zhejiang, where they joined forces with cadres who had persisted in guerrilla warfare and underground struggles locally. Over the past few years, relying on the close unity and joint efforts of cadres from outside and local cadres, significant achievements have been made in the province's socialist revolution and socialist construction. In various regions and tasks, cadres from outside and local cadres have generally been united, and the vast majority of them have served the cause of the Party and the people diligently and wholeheartedly. Many cadres from outside have established close ties with the local masses and have become localized; local cadres, after being tempered in various struggles, have also produced a large number of outstanding individuals, becoming the leading backbone of Party and government organs at all levels. These achievements are the main aspects of the Party's cadre work.

However, the facts revealed at this Provincial Party Congress show that some people still have serious localistic tendencies. They always emphasize that local cadres can represent the interests of the local masses, can connect with the local masses, and complain that the leadership does not promote and care for local cadres enough. A very small number of rightist elements with ulterior motives have taken advantage of this erroneous sentiment to carry out anti-Party activities. They fabricated stories saying that cadres from outside overwhelmed local cadres, they carried out挑拨离间 and created division within the Party, and they tried to win over some local cadres and exclude some cadres from outside. This localism and sectarianism has already caused a very harmful impact on Party unity. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre should learn from this Provincial Party Congress, draw a clear line, and thoroughly criticize and overcome this localistic tendency.

Who can represent the interests of the local masses? Is it those comrades who resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, or so-called local cadres like Sha Wenhan and Yang Siyi? The matter is very clear: only by resolutely engaging in socialism and communism can we represent the greatest and most fundamental interests of the people. For any cadre, whether from outside or locally, the main criterion for the people to support or oppose him is whether he is resolutely engaged in socialism, whether he resolutely implements the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, and not whether he is a local or an outsider. Over the past few years, cadres from outside in Zhejiang, together with local cadres, have united the people of the province, implemented the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, completed the democratic revolution, carried out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and enabled Zhejiang to increase its total agricultural output by more than 80% in just eight years, transforming it from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province; the total industrial output value has increased more than fourfold, from the old and backward old industry of the past to the current preliminary foundation of modern industry; beneficial contributions have also been made in other work aspects. Since cadres from outside can serve the people of Zhejiang so diligently, why can't they represent the interests of the local masses? Conversely, people like Sha Wenhan and Yang Siyi engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Can this be called representing the interests of the local masses? Doesn't their behavior precisely represent the interests of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie? It can be seen that the localists' so-called representation of the interests of the local masses is actually just a cover for their personal ambitions and anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, and has nothing in common with the true interests of the people or the interests of socialism.

Who can maintain close contact with the masses? In this regard, it should be recognized that local cadres have more favorable conditions than cadres from outside. For example, they have the same language and habits as the local people, and they have a better understanding of the local situation, and so on. However, having these conditions does not necessarily mean being able to maintain close contact with the masses. Some people can do it, but some people cannot. The main key to success or failure lies not in whether he is a local or an outsider, but in whether he has the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, whether he can correctly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, whether he has a mass viewpoint of consulting with the masses in everything, constantly listening to the opinions of the masses, and caring for the interests of the masses, and whether he is good at using the mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses." Facts have proven that as long as active and continuous efforts are made in the above aspects, not only local cadres can maintain close contact with the masses, but cadres from outside can also do the same. Many local cadres in Zhejiang have established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses in the long-term struggle; similarly, many cadres from outside have also established close ties with the local masses after several years of efforts. Although they may not necessarily speak the local dialect, they have a common language with the local masses. Although they were not born locally, they can completely localize themselves. Conversely, anyone who lacks a mass viewpoint and lacks a high degree of socialist enthusiasm will certainly fail to maintain close contact with the masses. People like Sha Wenhan never go to factories and the countryside, and do not approach workers and peasants. Those with whom they maintain close contact are only a small group of people who share their foul odor, and the opinions they reflect are mostly the reactionary clamor of landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and bourgeois rightists. It should also be pointed out that some of them (such as Yang Siyi, etc.) also emphasize contacting the masses, but their so-called contact with the masses does not start from a socialist standpoint, but from an individualistic and localistic standpoint. They pull and tug at old colleagues and old subordinates, treating them like family members, but are incompatible with others and are very indifferent. They use their personal influence and the backward consciousness of some of the masses to expand their political capital in every possible way. Especially when criticism and self-criticism are carried out within the Party, they act as representatives of the masses and rise up to viciously attack the Party's leadership. This tells us that localists can never truly connect with the masses, and their so-called connection with the masses is just a euphemism for carrying out localistic and sectarian anti-Party activities.

Who should be selected for leadership positions? In the past few years, in addition to relying on experienced cadres from outside who came from the old liberated areas, the Party has also paid special attention to cultivating and promoting a large number of local cadres. This is absolutely necessary. Because the emergence of a large number of outstanding local cadres reflects that the Party's work has gone deep, the consciousness of the masses has been raised, and the Party has taken root among the masses. Through these local cadres, it is possible to better connect with the masses and better combine the Party's guidelines and policies with the local situation. Doing so in the past and doing so now, and continuing to do so in the future, is beyond question. However, it must be pointed out that cadre localization is not the highest principle of the Party's cadre policy. The highest principle of the Party's cadre policy is first and foremost communism. Whether local cadres or cadres from outside, we must adhere to the principle of both ability and integrity and strive to achieve communism. "Localization" must be subordinate to "communization" in all circumstances, and it is never allowed to undermine this highest principle, let alone allow those with ulterior motives to use the slogan of cadre localization to develop localism. Localism is incompatible with communism. Especially among leading cadres, if there is a tendency towards localism, the harm to the Party and the people is even more serious. Because their localism is combined with personal ambition, they have a certain status and power, and they can influence some cadres and some of the masses. They can use these things as anti-Party capital. The higher their position, the greater the losses they cause to the Party and the people; they will not only ruin themselves, but may also poison other comrades.

Why does this localistic tendency exist within our Communist Party? To explore its social and historical roots, it is because many people in the Party come from non-proletarian backgrounds, and they are deeply influenced by feudalism and capitalism; at the same time, in the long-term, decentralized rural guerrilla warfare in the past, many divided different regions and mountain strongholds had been formed. After the national liberation, some people still had very deep imprints in their minds. They often haggle over whether you are from that region and I am from this region; they only remember the glorious history of their own region, but cannot see the glorious history of other regions; they only see the interests of their own region, and disregard the overall interests of the country. They often have tendencies of xenophobia and conservatism in politics, and tendencies of decentralism and sectarianism in organization. And those with personal ambitions use these tendencies to carry out localistic and sectarian activities, attempting to turn their own regions and departments into independent kingdoms to resist the Party's unified leadership. Under such circumstances, localism becomes a combination of bourgeois individualism and feudalism, and becomes a tool for some people to realize their personal ambitions. This tendency seriously hinders the Party's unity and solidarity and damages the cause of the Party and the people. Especially in the context of the socialist revolution and construction needing a high degree of unified will and unified strength, the harm of localism is even greater. It must be pointed out that this extremely conservative and backward localistic tendency was already the object of the revolution during the bourgeois democratic revolution, let alone during the socialist revolution. The socialist revolution and socialist construction require unified will, unified strength, and exchange of experiences. If one sits in a well and looks at the sky, clings to the old and preserves the incomplete, and is greedy for personal fame and gain, regardless of the overall interests, how can we talk about building socialism?

Our Party is a Communist Party, not a family clan or a hometown association. We take the interests of the entire Party and the entire people as our own interests. As long as the cause of the Party needs it, we can go to work in any region, and we also welcome any cadres from outside to work in their hometown regions. Only when the entire Party is united and working together with one heart under the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies can we build socialism. Localists are exactly the opposite. They advocate localism, feudalism, and individualism, and they will inevitably oppose the Party's leadership and undermine the Party's unity. Therefore, every Communist Party member must draw a clear line with localism. To support communism or to support localism, one must choose one of the two, and it is never allowed to be a Communist Party member in name while actually developing localism.

Language is a bridge for exchanging ideas and connecting with the masses. Mutual communication of language will greatly help cadres from outside and local cadres, and all cadres and the broad masses to better integrate with each other in work, thought, and emotion, and develop and improve together. Therefore, all cadres from outside must learn the local dialect, and all local cadres must learn Mandarin, and plans must be made to learn it within two or three years.

Cadres from outside and local cadres must unite closely under the principles of communism. If local cadres have localistic tendencies, they must be criticized. If cadres from outside have sectarian tendencies, they must also be criticized. However, attention should be paid to seeking truth from facts and drawing clear lines in criticism. Differences in opinions on work and different characteristics in lifestyle should not be mistakenly regarded as localism or sectarianism. Although cadres from outside and local cadres have different native places, their goals of struggle are completely consistent. Everyone should unite like one person on the basis of raising socialist consciousness, learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths, overcome one's weaknesses, improve together, and devote themselves wholeheartedly to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

### 地方主义同共产主义是不相容的

    地方主义同共产主义是不相容的
    ——浙江日报一月七日社论——
    中共浙江省第二届代表大会第二次会议的重要收获之一，就是认真批判了存在于党内的地方主义倾向。解决这个问题，对于加强全省党组织在党中央领导下的团结和统一，具有重大的意义。
    解放以后，党中央派了大批老解放区的干部来到浙江，同在当地坚持游击战争和地下斗争的干部会师。几年来，依靠外来干部和本地干部的密切团结和共同努力，已经给全省的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业做出了显著的成绩。在各个地区和各项工作中，外来干部和本地干部基本上都是团结的，他们绝大多数都是勤勤恳恳、全心全意地为党和人民的事业服务的。许多外来干部已经和当地群众取得密切联系，做到了地方化；本地干部经过各项斗争的锻炼，也涌现出大批的优秀分子，成为各级党政机关的领导骨干。这些成绩，是党的干部工作的主要方面。
    但是，这次全省党代表大会所揭发的事实说明：还有些人仍然存在着严重的地方主义倾向。他们总是强调本地干部能代表地方群众的利益，能联系当地群众，抱怨领导上对本地干部提拔不够、照顾不够。极少数别有用心的右派分子，就利用这种错误情绪来进行反党活动，他们无中生有地说什么外来干部压倒了本地干部，他们在党内进行挑拨离间，制造分裂，拉拢一部分本地干部，排斥一部分外来干部。这种地方主义、宗派主义活动，已经对党内团结造成十分有害的影响。每个共产党员和革命干部都应当从这次全省党代表大会中吸取教训，划清界线，彻底批判和克服这种地方主义倾向。
    谁能够代表地方群众的利益？是那些坚决执行党中央的方针路线的同志？还是像沙文汉、杨思一那样的所谓本地干部？事情是很明显的，只有坚决搞社会主义和共产主义，才能够代表人民的最大最根本的利益。对于任何干部，不论是外来干部或者本地干部，人民赞成他还是反对他，主要的标准是看他是不是坚决搞社会主义，是不是坚决执行党中央的方针路线，而不是看他是本地人还是外地人。几年来，外来干部在浙江，同本地干部一起，团结了全省人民，执行了党中央的方针路线，完成了民主革命，进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使浙江在短短的八年当中，农业总产值增长了80％以上，从缺粮省变为余粮省；工业总产值增长了四倍以上，从过去破旧落后的旧有工业到目前的具有了现代工业的初步基础；在其他各项工作方面也都做出了有益的贡献。既然外来干部能够这样勤勤恳恳地为浙江人民服务，为什么他们不能够代表地方群众的利益呢？与此相反，像沙文汉、杨思一等人，进行反党反社会主义活动，这难道能叫作代表地方群众的利益吗？他们的所作所为，难道不正是代表了地主阶级和资产阶级的利益吗？由此可见，地方主义者所谓代表地方群众的利益，实际上不过是为他们的个人野心和反党反社会主义活动打掩护，同真正的人民利益、社会主义利益是毫无相同之处的。
    什么人能够密切联系群众？在这个方面，应当看到：本地干部比外来干部具有更多的有利条件。例如他们和当地人民有着相同的语言和习惯，比较了解地方的情况，等等。但是，具有这些条件并不等于一定能够做到密切联系群众。有些人可以做到，有些人却做不到。做到或者做不到的主要关键，不在于是本地人还是外地人，而在于他是不是具有全心全意为人民服务的精神，是不是能正确地执行党的方针政策，是不是具有遇事同群众商量、经常倾听群众意见、关心群众利益的群众观点，以及是不是善于运用“从群众中来、到群众中去”的群众路线工作方法。事实证明：只要积极地从上述方面作不断的努力，不仅本地干部可以做到密切联系群众，而且外来干部也同样可以做到。浙江有很多本地干部在长期斗争中和群众建立了血肉相连的关系；同样的，有很多外来干部，经过几年来的努力，也和当地群众取得了密切的联系。他们虽然不一定会讲本地话，但是却和当地群众有着共同的语言，他们虽然不出生于本地，但是却能够完全做到地方化。与此相反，凡是缺乏群众观点、缺乏社会主义的高度热忱的人，就一定做不到密切联系群众。像沙文汉这样的人，从来不到工厂和农村，不接近工人和农民，他们所密切联系的只是一小撮和他们臭味相投的人，他们所反映的意见多是那些地主分子、反革命分子、以及资产阶级右派分子的反动叫嚣。还应当指出：他们中间有些人（如杨思一等）也强调联系群众，但是，他们所谓联系群众，并不是从社会主义的立场出发，而是从个人主义、地方主义的立场出发。对于老同事、老部下就拉拉扯扯，亲如家人，对于其他人就格格不入，十分冷淡。他们利用个人的影响，利用部分群众的落后意识，千方百计地扩大自己的政治资本。特别是在党内开展批评和自我批评的时候，他们就以群众代表自居，起而恶毒地攻击党的领导。这就告诉我们：地方主义者决不可能真正地联系群众，他们的所谓联系群众，只不过是进行地方主义、宗派主义的反党活动的代名词而已。
    应当选拔什么人到领导岗位上来？过去几年，党除了依靠从老解放区来的较有丰富经验的外来干部以外，还特别重视培养和提拔了大量的本地干部。这样做，是完全必要的。因为大批优秀的本地干部的出现，正是反映了党的工作已经深入，群众的觉悟已经提高，党在群众中已经生根。通过这些本地干部，可以更好地联系群众，更好地把党的方针政策和当地情况结合起来。过去和现在这样做，今后还要继续这样做，这是没有疑问的。但是，必须指出：干部地方化并不是党的干部政策的最高原则。党的干部政策的最高原则首先是共产主义化。无论是本地干部或者外来干部，都必须坚持德才兼备的原则，努力做到共产主义化。“地方化”在任何情况下都必须服从于“共产主义化”，而决不容许破坏这个最高原则，更不容许那些别有用心的人利用干部地方化的口号来发展地方主义。地方主义同共产主义是不相容的。特别是在领导干部中，如果有了地方主义倾向，对于党和人民的危害就更加严重。因为他们的地方主义是和个人野心结合在一起的，他们有一定的地位和权力，又能够影响一部分干部和一部分群众，他们可以利用这些东西作为反党的资本。他们的地位愈高，对党和人民所造成的损失就愈大；他们不仅会葬送自己，而且还可能毒害其他同志。
    在我们共产党内，为什么会存在这种地方主义倾向呢？究其社会根源和历史根源，是由于党内有许多人出身于非无产阶级，他们受到封建主义、资本主义影响较深；同时，在过去长期的分散的农村游击战争中，曾经形成过许多分割的不同地区和山头。全国解放以后，有些人思想上仍然存在很深的烙印。他们往往计较你是那个地区，我是这个地区；只记得自己地区的光荣历史，而看不到别个地区的光荣历史；只看到自己地区的利益，而不顾全国的整体的利益。他们往往在政治上存在着排外主义、保守主义倾向，在组织上存在着分散主义、宗派主义倾向。而具有个人野心的人就利用这些倾向，进行地方主义、宗派主义活动，企图把自己的地区和部门变成独立王国，对抗党的统一领导。在这种情况下，地方主义就成为资产阶级个人主义和封建主义的结合物，变成了某些人实现个人野心的工具。这种倾向严重地妨害着党的团结和统一，损害着党和人民的事业。特别是在社会主义革命和建设需要高度统一意志、统一力量的情况下，地方主义的危害性更大。必须指出：这种极端保守落后的地方主义倾向，在资产阶级民主革命时期就已经成为革命的对象，更不用说在社会主义革命时期。社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业要求统一意志、统一力量、交流经验。如果坐井观天、抱残守缺，贪图个人名利，不顾整体利益，还谈得上建设社会主义吗？
    我们的党是共产主义的党，不是家族团体，也不是同乡会。我们是以全党全体人民的利益为自己的利益的。只要党的事业需要，我们可以到任何地区去工作，也欢迎任何外来干部到自己家乡地区工作。只有全党在党中央的方针路线下团结一致、同心合力，才能建成社会主义。而地方主义者正好与此相反，他们是主张地方主义、封建主义、个人主义的，他们必然会反对党的领导、破坏党的团结。因此，每一个共产党员，都必须同地方主义划清界线。赞成共产主义，还是赞成地方主义，二者必居其一，决不容许挂名做一个共产党员，实际上却在发展地方主义。
    语言是交流思想、联系群众的桥梁。语言的相互沟通，将会大大地帮助外地干部同本地干部、一切干部同广大群众在工作上思想上感情上更好地打成一片，共同发展，共同提高。因此，所有的外来干部都要学本地话，所有的本地干部都要学普通话，并且要订出规划，在两三年内一定要学会。
    外来干部和本地干部必须在共产主义的原则下亲密团结起来。本地干部当中如果有地方主义倾向，就必须受到批判。外来干部当中如果有宗派主义倾向，也必须受到批判。但是在批判中要注意实事求是、划清界线。不能把工作上的不同意见、生活作风上的不同特点也错误地当作地方主义或者宗派主义。外来干部和本地干部的籍贯虽然不同，但是奋斗目标是完全一致的，大家应当在提高社会主义觉悟的基础上，团结得像一个人一样，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高，一心一意地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
