    Not Just Two Wings
    The spokesmen of the American monopoly groups, such as Little Hoover and Dillon, clamor to cut off the wings of the French Rooster. The American wolf is truly vicious towards the French Rooster. But what is the attitude of the French rulers towards its American "ally"?
    French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard and Foreign Minister Pineau declared in unison in the French National Assembly that France cannot refuse to establish American missile bases on its territory. The French Rooster is utterly loyal to the American wolf.
    However, if France turns its territory into an American missile base, then the danger it faces will be more than just losing two wings.

    不仅两只翅膀
    美国垄断集团的代言人小胡佛和狄龙之流大喊要剪掉法国雄鸡的翅膀。美国狼对于法国雄鸡可谓用心狠毒了。但是法国统治者对于它的美国“盟友”抱着什么样的态度呢？
    法国总理盖伊阿和外长比诺在法国民议会上异口同声宣告：法国不能拒绝在它的国土上建立美国的导弹基地。法国雄鸡对美国狼却是忠心耿耿。
    但是，法国如果把自己的国土变作美国导弹基地，那么它所冒的危险就将不仅是失去两只翅膀而已。
