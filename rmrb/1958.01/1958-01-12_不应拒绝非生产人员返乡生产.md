    Non-Productive Personnel Should Not Be Refused Return to Rural Production

    Editor:
    The work of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, in mobilizing the families of employees to return to the countryside has achieved certain results. As of November 25 last year, 12,874 people had completed the procedures for transferring their household registration and grain supply, and the vast majority of them have returned to their hometowns. According to our understanding, these returning family members have generally been warmly welcomed by the local areas. Not only have the communes and townships allocated them grain and vegetables, but they have also assisted them in finding housing. Families with financial difficulties have also been granted loans by credit cooperatives. These practices have greatly promoted the mobilization of employees' families to return to the countryside. However, many agricultural cooperatives, township people's committees, and even county people's committees have adopted a negative and indifferent attitude towards this work, deliberately making things difficult for returning family members, and even using various excuses to refuse their return to participate in production. After some employees' family members returned, the township did not refuse to register them, but required them to make up for the full year's labor days and pay the share fund in one lump sum; otherwise, they would not be allocated grain. After the family members of worker Wang Tongshun of our city's Engineering Bureau returned to Zhaotuan Township, Anping County, Hebei Province, the township did not supply grain and wrote a letter saying: Our commune has already reported the population to the higher authorities and cannot add any more, please supply it on a monthly basis. Some family members have difficulty returning to the husband's hometown and are willing to return to their mother's home to participate in production, but they have also been rejected by the local area, on the grounds that they are no longer considered people of that place since they have married. For example, the wife of worker Luo Tingxiu of the Engineering Bureau wanted to return to her original home in Taigu County, but the relevant departments of the county refused to accept her. Some employees even found partners in other counties, but their household registration had not yet been moved, and the local area refused to provide grain, which in effect is encouraging employees' families to leave the countryside and enter the city.
    The above-mentioned undesirable phenomena are most serious in Pingle and Xiyang counties, and also exist in Mengxian, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, Pingyao and other counties. We believe that the reason why the relevant departments in these places have adopted a wrong attitude towards the work of mobilizing employees' families to return to the countryside is mainly because they have a fear of trouble, only see the interests of their own township and commune, and do not see the interests of the country; they only see the immediate interests, and do not see the long-term interests. It is necessary to raise this issue to attract the attention of party and government organs in various places.

    不应拒绝非生产人员返乡生产
    编辑同志：
    山西省阳泉市动员职工家属返乡的工作已获得一定的成绩，截至去年11月25日止，已有一万二千八百七十四人办理了迁移户口和粮食转供手续，其中绝大部分已回到原籍。据我们了解，这些返乡的家属大都受到当地的热烈欢迎。各乡社不仅给他（她）们分配了粮食蔬菜，而且协助他（她）们找寻房屋，有经济困难的家属，还由信用社贷款给他们。这些作法，对动员职工家属返乡起了很大推动作用。但是，也有不少农业社、乡人民委员会，甚至县人民委员会，对这项工作采取了消极冷淡的态度，有意为难返乡的家属，甚至用各种借口拒绝他（她）们返乡参加生产。有些职工家属回去以后，乡里虽然没有不让他（她）们落户，但要求他（她）们把全年的劳动日补起来，把股份基金一次缴清；否则，就不给他（她）们分配粮食。我市工程局工人王同顺的家属回到河北安平县赵疃乡后，乡里不供应粮食，并且来信说：我社已向上级报了人口，不能再添，请你处按月供应。还有一些家属，回男方的家乡有困难，愿意回到娘家所在地参加生产，也遭到当地的拒绝，理由是既已出嫁，就不算那里的人。如工程局工人罗庭秀的爱人，想回原籍太谷县，该县有关部门就不肯接受。甚至有的职工在外县找到对象，但是户口还没有迁来，当地就不给留粮，这实际上是在鼓励职工家属离乡进城。
    上述几种不应有的现象，以平定、昔阳两县最为严重，盂县、寿阳、榆次、太谷、平遥等县也有。我们认为，这些地方的有关部门，所以对动员职工家属返乡的工作采取错误态度，主要是他们有怕麻烦的思想，只看到本乡本社的利益，没有看到国家的利益；只看到眼前的利益，没有看到长远的利益。有必要把这个问题提出来，以引起各地党政机关的注意。
