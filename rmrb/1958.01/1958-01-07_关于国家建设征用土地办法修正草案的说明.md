Explanation of the Draft Amendment to the National Land Requisition for Construction Method
Tao Xijin, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council

    I will now explain the following points regarding the draft amendment to the National Land Requisition for Construction Method:

    (1) Since the promulgation and implementation of the "Government Administration Council's Method on National Land Requisition for Construction" on December 5, 1953, it has played an active role in ensuring national construction land requisition and addressing the production and livelihood issues of those whose land is requisitioned. In recent years, due to the rapid advancement of socialist construction and socialist transformation, advanced agricultural production cooperatives have become widespread throughout the country, and the ownership of means of production has undergone fundamental changes. The original method can no longer fully adapt to many new problems that have arisen in the current land requisition work. At the same time, some central state organs and provinces and cities have successively issued some normative documents based on the basic spirit of the original method in order to solve these new problems. Now, it seems that there are some conflicting and unrealistic phenomena among them. Therefore, the State Council believes that many provisions of the original method need to be uniformly revised. During the revision process, the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State Council systematically sorted out the relevant laws and regulations in this regard, and conducted extensive investigations and research on various issues, and put forward a draft amendment. This draft amendment has been discussed and approved by the 58th plenary meeting of the State Council, and is now submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and approval.

    (2) Regarding several major issues in the draft amendment:

    1.  The primary focus of this revision of the original method is on saving land. In the past eight years, the state has requisitioned more than 20 million mu of land for construction. Most of these land requisitions were necessary, ensuring the rapid development of socialist construction. However, in some areas and certain units, the phenomenon of wasting land, such as requisitioning more and using less, requisitioning early and using late, or even requisitioning without using, is also quite serious. According to the inspection of Hebei, Chengdu, Wuhan, Changsha, Beijing, Hangzhou and other provinces and cities in 1956, the wasted land in the land requisitioned in the past few years accounted for about 40%. In Taiyuan City, 22 construction units requisitioned more than 10,000 mu of land, and more than 5,000 mu were barren, reaching 50%. The reason for the waste of land is certainly related to the lack of experience in large-scale socialist construction, and the original method's provisions on saving land and preventing land waste are not specific and detailed enough, especially the lack of a clear supervision and inspection system, which is also a major reason. Since the State Council issued a notice in January 1956 on correcting and preventing waste in national construction land requisition, requiring all localities to conduct regular inspections of the use of requisitioned land, the situation has improved. For example, in Hebei Province, due to regular inspections of the use of requisitioned land, the percentage of wasted land has dropped from 34.8% in 1955 to 9.3% in 1956. In order to further emphasize saving land and establish and improve the supervision and inspection system, Articles 3, 15, and 21 of the draft amendment stipulate that: all projects that can be postponed should not be carried out; land requisition must be carefully calculated, and the building density should be strictly controlled to prevent excessive and premature requisition; if the requisitioned land is not used or is surplus due to a change in plan, it must be returned in time; the people's committees at the county level and above and the superior authorities of the land-using units must regularly supervise and inspect the use of land, and if they find land that is requisitioned but not used or requisitioned more and used less, they should promptly recover it and hand it over to the local agricultural production cooperative for cultivation.

    Whether the examination and approval procedures are appropriate is the key to controlling land use and preventing land waste. The original method's approval authority for land requisition was, on the one hand, too centralized at the central level, and on the other hand, it was not very reasonable to distinguish the approval authority of the central or local governments based on the use of land for national or local construction projects. In addition, the authorities that approved the preliminary design of construction projects were not the same as the authorities that approved the amount of land used, so they encountered some practical difficulties in implementation. In order to conform to the spirit of the central government's appropriate decentralization of administrative management authority and to more realistically control land use, the draft amendment stipulates that the amount of land to be requisitioned must be approved by the authority that has the right to approve the preliminary design of the construction project, and then the provincial or county-level people's committee where the land is located will specifically allocate the land in the spirit of using wasteland, inferior land, and vacant land as much as possible. According to the experience of the past few years, such a provision, that is, the authority that has the right to approve the preliminary design of the construction project is also responsible for approving the amount of land used, can more effectively and reasonably control land use and prevent land waste. When the people's committees at the provincial and county levels allocate land, if the land used is less than 300 mu, but the number of residents relocated exceeds 30 households, or if the number of residents relocated is less than 30 households, but the land used exceeds 300 mu, it must be allocated by the provincial people's committee. This is because in this case, it is safer for the provincial people's committee to take charge, and at the same time, it takes into account the practical difficulties of the county-level people's committee in dealing with such problems.

    2. Regarding the issue of compensation for land requisition. When the original method was formulated, the object of compensation for land requisition was individual farmers; after agricultural cooperation, the object of compensation should be agricultural production cooperatives. The original method stipulated that the land compensation standard was the total value of three to five years of output; in view of the fact that the production and living standards of farmers have been improved after agricultural cooperation, the original standard seems to be a bit too high. At the same time, the output stipulated in the original method is not clear in calculation. The draft amendment, based on the principle of taking care of the interests of the masses and saving state expenditures, changes the compensation standard to the total value of two to four years of fixed output. Judging from the actual experience of the past few years, the fixed output of land and the living standards of farmers vary from place to place, and it is appropriate to stipulate such a range for the compensation standard. In addition, due to the improvement of the political awareness of the masses, some agricultural production cooperatives whose land has been requisitioned in small amounts believe that it does not affect their production and the lives of their members, and express their enthusiasm to support national construction and do not want compensation. The state should encourage this spirit of the masses; but it must pay attention to grasping it, both to prevent underestimating the political enthusiasm of the masses, and to prevent not carefully considering whether the production and life of the masses will be affected after the land is requisitioned. Therefore, the first paragraph of Article 9 of the draft amendment stipulates: "If the members' congress or members' representative congress of an agricultural production cooperative believes that it has no impact on the lives of the members and does not require compensation, and with the consent of the local county-level people's committee, compensation may not be paid for the requisition of the agricultural production cooperative's land." In another situation, when requisitioning land used by agricultural cooperatives that does not belong to the cooperative members (such as land rented, pawned, or entrusted by relatives and friends to grow or manage before the members joined the cooperative, and they brought it into the cooperative), local authorities believe that if the owner of the land is not engaged in agricultural production and does not maintain a living on the income from the land, compensation may not be paid. We think this can be done, but it should also be with the consent of the person concerned. The second paragraph of Article 9 of the draft amendment is stipulated in this way.

    3. Regarding the resettlement of those whose land is requisitioned. The original method did not emphasize enough on-site agricultural resettlement, and farmers whose land was requisitioned excessively demanded to change their occupations, which is not in line with the state's policy of mobilizing people to "go to the countryside and mountains." Moreover, the original method did not stipulate clearly and specifically enough regarding the organization of immigration, and some localities have caused adverse effects of wasting money and manpower due to hasty immigration. In view of these situations, the draft amendment first emphasizes on-site agricultural resettlement as much as possible without affecting production and life; if it is necessary to organize immigration, the county-level and above people's committees of the relocation and resettlement areas must jointly and effectively take responsibility. When organizing immigration, special attention should be paid to the fact that the resettlement area must have long-term settlement production conditions.

    4. In the past few years, when appropriating state-owned and public land that is being used by state organs, troops, enterprises, schools, people's organizations, and other units, the original users often demanded excessively high exchange conditions for the appropriation, while some of the applicant land-using units did not solve the demands of the original users that should be solved. In order to facilitate the solution of these problems, in the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, a supplementary provision was made in the second paragraph of Article 18 of the draft amendment.

    (3) In view of the fact that the several fundamental principles of the original method are still correct in our view, and all localities are relatively familiar with the implementation of the original method in the past few years, the original method has not been re-drafted, but only some necessary revisions have been made, and the name of the original method is still used; all the original articles that can be left unchanged are also retained as much as possible and not changed. It must be especially pointed out that Article 5 of the original method, which stipulates that land requisition must be explained to the masses, has proven to be very good in the experience of implementation over the past few years. Therefore, the draft amendment still retains this provision. We believe that major events like handling land requisition that are directly related to the production and life of the masses must conscientiously implement the mass line, so that the masses can consciously obey the interests of the country and the long-term interests of the people under the conditions that their current immediate interests are properly taken care of, in order to do a good job. In fact, the requisition of land for construction in our country is consistent with the interests of the broad masses of the people. As long as it is fully explained to the masses, their consent and support will be obtained. Therefore, resolutely implementing the mass line is an important key to ensuring the successful completion of land requisition work.

    关于国家建设征用土地办法修正草案的说明
    国务院副秘书长　陶希晋
    现在我对国家建设征用土地办法修正草案，作以下几点说明：
    （一）“政务院关于国家建设征用土地办法”自从1953年12月5日公布施行以来，对于国家建设征用土地和处理被征用土地者的生产、生活问题，都起了积极的保证作用。近几年来，由于社会主义建设和社会主义改造突飞猛进，高级农业生产合作社已普及全国，生产资料所有制发生了根本变化，原办法对于当前在征用土地工作中所发生的许多新的问题已不能完全适应；与此同时，有些中央国家机关和省、市，为了解决这些新的问题，根据原办法的基本精神，先后发布了一些规范性文件，现在看来，其中也存在着有些抵触和不切实际的现象。因此，国务院认为原办法的许多规定有作统一修改的必要。在修改过程中，由国务院法制局对有关这方面的法规作了系统的整理，并就各项问题进行了多方面的调查研究，提出了修正草案。此项修正草案，业经国务院第五十八次全体会议讨论通过，现在提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议批准。
    （二）关于修正草案中的几个主要问题：
    1、这次对原办法的修改，首先着眼的是节约用地。八年多来，国家因建设征用的土地约在两千万亩以上。这些土地的征用，大部分是必需的，保证了社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。但是，在有的地区和某些单位，多征少用、早征迟用甚至征而不用等浪费土地的现象，也相当严重。根据河北、成都、武汉、长沙、北京、杭州等省市1956年的检查，几年征用土地中浪费的土地约占40％。太原市二十二个建设单位征用土地一万多亩，荒芜五千多亩，达到50％。浪费土地的原因，固然同大规模进行社会主义建设经验不足有关，而原办法对于节约用地、防止土地浪费，规定得不够具体细致，特别是缺乏明确的监督检查制度，也有很大关系。自从1956年1月国务院发布关于纠正与防止国家建设征用土地中浪费现象的通知，要求各地对已征土地的使用情况进行经常检查以后，情况有好转。比如，河北省由于对已征土地的使用情况经常进行检查，浪费土地的百分比已由1955年的34.8％下降到1956年的9.3％。为了进一步强调节约用地，建立与健全监督检查制度，修正草案的第三、第十五、第二十一等条规定：一切目前可以不举办的工程，都不应该举办；征用土地必须精打细算，严格控制建筑密度，防止多征早征；已经征用的土地，如果因计划变更而不使用或有多余，必须及时交回；县级以上人民委员会和用地单位的上级机关，必须对使用土地的情况经常进行监督检查，发现征而不用和征多用少的土地，应当及时收回交给当地农业生产合作社耕种。
    审批程序的确当与否，是控制用地、防止土地浪费的关键。原办法关于征用土地的批准权，一则中央集中的较多，二则以全国性或者地方性的建设事业用地来区别中央或者地方政府批准的权限，也不很合理，再加以批准建设工程初步设计的机关同批准用地数量的机关又不统一，因此在执行中都遇到了一些实际困难。为了符合中央关于行政管理权限适当下放的精神和更切合实际地控制用地，修正草案规定：征用土地必须由有权批准本项建设工程初步设计的机关负责批准用地的数量，然后由用地所在地的省级或者县级人民委员会本着尽量用荒地、劣地、空地的精神具体核拨用地。根据最近几年来的经验，这样的规定，亦即是由有权批准建设工程初步设计的机关一并负责批准用地数量，才能更有效地合理地掌握用地，防止土地浪费。在省、县两级人民委员会核拨用地的时候，如果用地虽在三百亩以下，但迁移居民超过三十户，或者迁移居民虽在三十户以下，但用地超过三百亩，都必须由省级人民委员会核拨。这是因为在这种情况下，由省级人民委员会掌握较为稳妥，同时也照顾到县级人民委员会处理这类问题的实际困难。
    2、关于征用土地的补偿问题。在原办法制定的时候，征用土地发补偿费的对象是个体农民；农业合作化以后，发补偿费的对象应当是农业生产合作社。土地补偿标准，原办法规定为三年至五年的产量总值；鉴于农业合作化以后农民的生产、生活都有所提高，原来的标准，就显得有些过高，同时原办法规定的产量在计算上也不明确，修正草案本着既照顾群众利益又节省国家开支的原则，将补偿标准改为二年至四年的定产量总值。从几年来的实际经验来看，各地土地定产量和农民生活水平都有所不同，对补偿标准规定这样的幅度是适当的。此外，由于群众政治觉悟提高，有的被征用了少量土地的农业生产合作社认为不影响它们的生产和社员的生活，表示热情支援国家建设，不要补偿费。对于群众的这种精神，国家应予鼓励；但必须注意掌握，既要防止对群众的政治热情估计不足，又要防止不很好考虑群众在被征用土地后生产和生活是否会受到影响。所以修正草案第九条第一款规定：“征用农业生产合作社的土地，如果社员大会或者社员代表大会认为对社员生活没有影响，不需要补偿，并经当地县级人民委员会同意，可以不发给补偿费”。另一种情况，征用农业社使用的非社员的土地（如社员在入社前租来、典来或者受亲友委托代种、代管而由他们带着入了社的土地），各地认为如果该土地所有人不从事农业生产又不以土地收入维持生活，可以不发补偿费。我们觉得可以这样做，但也必须经本人同意为宜。修正草案第九条第二款就是这样规定的。
    3、关于对被征用土地者的安置问题。原办法对于就地在农业上安置强调不够，被征用土地的农民过多地要求转业，这同国家多动员人“下乡上山”的方针不相符合。又原办法对于组织移民也规定的不够明确具体，有的地方曾因草率移民造成了劳民伤财的不良影响。修正草案针对着这些情况，首先强调在不影响生产、生活的原则下尽量就地在农业上安置；如果必须组织移民时，迁出和迁入地区的县级以上人民委员会必须共同切实负责。在组织移民时，应特别注意，迁入地区必须有长期定居的生产条件。
    4、几年来在拨用国家机关、部队、企业、学校、人民团体等单位正在使用着的国有、公有土地时，原使用单位对于拨用的交换条件，往往要求过高，而申请用地单位则有的对原使用单位的要求，应该解决的也不予解决。为了便于解决这些问题，本着勤俭建国的精神，在修正草案第十八条第二款作了补充规定。
    （三）鉴于原办法的几个根本原则，现在看来还是正确的，几年来各地对原办法的执行也比较熟悉，所以对原办法未作重新起草，而只作若干的必要修改，并且仍然沿用了原办法的名称；原条文中凡是可以不改动的，亦都尽量予以保留，不作改动。特别须指出的，原办法第五条关于征用土地必须向群众进行解释的规定，几年来执行的经验证明很好。所以修正草案仍保留这规定，我们认为像处理征用土地这样直接关系到群众生产和生活的大事，必须认真贯彻群众路线，使群众在当前切身利益得到适当照顾的条件下，自觉地服从国家利益和人民的长远利益，才能做好。事实上，我们国家因建设而征用土地，同广大群众的利益是一致的，只要向群众充分地解释清楚，就会取得群众的同意和支持。因此，坚决贯彻群众路线是保证做好土地征用工作的一个重要关键。
