To prevent Yellow Music from Poisoning the People
Relevant Departments in Various Regions Begin to Take Measures

    (Our report) Recently, the rampant spread of yellow songs has become quite serious in some large and medium-sized cities. In many dance halls, stores, parks, and even in some offices, factories, and schools, the decadent sounds of yellow songs can be heard. Yellow song records have become temporary "rare commodities," and many illegal vendors are scouring for these records, selling them at astonishingly high prices, turning over one or two thousand at a time. Many "photo developing shops" and vendors openly sell a large number of yellow song sheets printed with photos of some female movie stars from the old society. Some construction sites and individual offices and shops even broadcast them widely from morning to night with loudspeakers. Factories, offices, and workers' clubs even use yellow songs and yellow music to accompany dancing. Even some local radio stations are broadcasting yellow songs to the masses under the guise of "old song replay" concerts. Those who sing yellow songs include not only young students, but also workers, children, and even young soldiers. As a result of the proliferation of yellow songs, the will of some young people has been seriously eroded, leading to many acts of lax labor discipline, decadent lifestyles, moral corruption, and behaviors that endanger social order.
    In order to stop the continued spread of yellow songs, music associations and relevant mass organizations in some places have taken some measures. The Liaoning Branch of the Musicians Association has collected nearly five hundred popular songs from the past for analysis and research, and is preparing to propose a classified catalog of yellow songs to help the masses identify these poisonous weeds. The Wuhan Branch of the Musicians Association invited more than 30 musicians to hold a forum to criticize yellow music. After playing some yellow song records at the meeting, the musicians analyzed and criticized these "works." Many musicians expressed their willingness to actively participate in this struggle and expressed that they would create more light music songs to meet the needs of the masses. The Wuhan Lecture Hall and the Wuhan Mass Art Museum jointly held lectures criticizing yellow music. Musicians Cheng Yun and Lin Lu gave reports in Hankou and Wuchang respectively, titled "Resolutely Launch the Struggle Against Yellow Music" and "The Great Significance of Launching the Struggle Against Yellow Music."
    Newspapers in various places have also launched criticisms of yellow music. China Youth Daily published an editorial, "No Yellow Songs Allowed to Poison the Youth," calling on young people to eliminate the remaining bourgeois ideological influences in their minds, cultivate noble tastes in artistic hobbies, and resolutely and thoroughly fight against yellow music. Liaoning Daily, Shenyang Daily, Shanghai Jiefang Daily, Dagongbao, and other newspapers also published special articles or short comments such as "Struggle to Eliminate Yellow Songs," "Yellow Songs Must Not Be Allowed to Revive," "How to Identify Yellow Songs," and "Do Not Let Yellow Music Spread," exposing the reactionary and decadent consciousness promoted by yellow music and its harmfulness. Shenyang Daily also published the record of a workers' forum held by the newspaper's editorial department at the Tiexi Nonferrous Metal Mining Machinery Factory. Beijing Daily, Jiefang Daily, Wenhui Daily, and other newspapers also published letters from readers. These reports and letters fully reflect the unanimous anger of the broad masses in condemning these obscene and decadent songs and demanding that their circulation be stopped.

    不让黄色音乐毒害人民
    各地有关部门开始采取措施
    本报讯　最近以来，一些大、中城市里，黄色歌曲泛滥情况相当严重。在许多舞会上和商店、公园，甚至在个别机关、车间和学校里，也可以听到黄色歌曲的靡靡之音。黄色歌曲唱片成了一时的“奇货”，不少不法摊贩到处搜罗这类唱片，以惊人的高价出售，一转手就是一、二千张。不少“洗印社”和商贩公开大量贩卖印有旧社会中某些电影女明星照片的黄色歌曲歌片。一些工地和个别机关、商店还用大喇叭从早到晚广为播送。工厂、机关和工人俱乐部也竟用黄色歌曲和黄色音乐来伴舞。甚至某些地方广播电台，也有借用“旧歌重放”音乐会的名义向人民群众播送黄色歌曲。唱黄色歌曲的人，不仅有青年学生，而且还有工人、儿童甚至青年军人。由于黄色歌曲泛滥的结果，已经严重地腐蚀了一些青年的意志，发生了许多劳动纪律松弛、生活腐化、道德败坏和危害社会秩序的行为。
    为了制止黄色歌曲的继续泛滥，有些地方的音乐家协会和有关群众团体已经采取了一些措施。音协辽宁分会搜集了近五百首过去流行的歌曲进行了分析研究，准备提出一个分门别类的黄色歌曲的目录，以帮助群众识别这些毒草。音协武汉分会邀请了三十多位音乐家举行座谈，批判黄色音乐。会上放送了一些黄色歌曲唱片后，音乐家们针对这些“作品”进行分析批判。许多音乐家们都表示要积极投入这一场斗争中来，并表示要创作出更多的轻音乐歌曲，以满足群众需要。武汉市讲演馆和武汉市群众艺术馆联合举办了批判黄色音乐的讲座，由音乐家程云、林路以“坚决开展反对黄色音乐的斗争”和“开展反对黄色音乐斗争的重大意义”为题，分别在汉口、武昌两地作报告。
    各地报纸也展开了对黄色音乐的批判。中国青年报发表了社论“不许黄色歌曲毒害青年”，号召青年清除头脑中残存的资产阶级思想影响，培养艺术爱好上的高尚趣味，坚决彻底地向黄色音乐作斗争。辽宁日报、沈阳日报、上海解放日报、大公报等也发表了“为肃清黄色歌曲而斗争”、“不能让黄色歌曲死灰复燃”、“怎样辨认黄色歌曲”、“不让黄色音乐蔓延”等专文或短评，揭发了黄色音乐宣扬的反动、腐朽意识以及它的危害性。沈阳日报还发表了该报编辑部在铁西有色金属矿山机械厂召开的工人座谈会记录。北京日报、解放日报、文汇报等也发表了读者来信。这些报道和来信，充分反映出广大群众一致愤怒斥责这些淫秽腐朽的歌曲，要求制止它的流行。
