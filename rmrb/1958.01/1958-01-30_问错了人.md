    Asked the Wrong Person

    On the opening day of the Ankara Conference, a reporter asked Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu: Will missile bases be established in the Baghdad Pact region? Zorlu said he could not answer this question because he did not yet know whether Dulles would make such a proposal at this meeting.

    It seems that the reporter clearly asked the wrong person. It turns out that major matters concerning the Baghdad Pact should not be asked of the Foreign Minister of a member state of the treaty, but should be asked of the "observer" of the "non-member state" - he is the real master of this meeting.

    问错了人
    在安卡拉会议开幕的那一天，有一个记者问土耳其外交部长佐鲁：在巴格达条约地区是否要建立导弹基地？佐鲁表示不能回答这个问题，因为他还不知道杜勒斯是否会在这次会议上提出这种建议。
    看来那个记者显然是问错了人。原来有关巴格达条约的重大事情，是不该去问这个条约成员国的外交部长的，而应该去问那个“非成员国”的“观察员”——他才是这次会议的真正主人。
