Million Hectares of Barren Land Transformed into Fertile Fields
By our reporter Kang Weizhong

Heilongjiang Province, known as the "Great Northern Wilderness," is China's most ideal place for land reclamation. The province has about 100 million mu of reclaimable wasteland. In the few years since liberation, especially after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in 1956, almost every county launched a mass movement to reclaim wasteland and increase grain production. By 1957, the province had reclaimed more than 1,189,000 hectares of wasteland, equivalent to about one-sixth of the current cultivated area. This is only the beginning of wasteland development. According to Heilongjiang Province's agricultural plan, in the next ten years, while vigorously increasing yield per unit area, it will continue to reclaim more than 1,410,000 hectares of wasteland. By then, the cultivated area of Heilongjiang Province will reach more than 120 million mu, and Heilongjiang Province will become even more prosperous and beautiful.

Heilongjiang Province has many superior conditions for land reclamation. The province has flat terrain, fertile soil, lush forests, crisscrossing rivers, sufficient rainfall, and convenient transportation. The frost-free period in the northernmost part of the province is generally around 120 days. It is not only suitable for growing crops such as wheat, soybeans, millet, and sorghum, but also rice can grow very well. Based on these superior natural conditions, after liberation, the Party and the government regarded leading and organizing the masses to reclaim wasteland as an important measure to increase grain production throughout the province. Due to the province's vast area, sparse population, and the widespread distribution of wasteland throughout the province, in addition to the small-scale land reclamation organized by cooperatives in various counties according to local conditions, after surveying and planning, the state also established 31 large-scale state-owned farms on the Nenjiang and Hejiang plains. Starting in 1956, with demobilized officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps as the main force, several large-scale mechanized state-owned military reclamation farms were established in Mishan, Baoqing, Hulin and other counties in southeastern Heilongjiang Province. Immigrant reclamation team members, numbering more than 260,000, from Beijing, Tianjin, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Jiamusi, are also an important force in land reclamation in this province. These people formed more than 400 new immigrant villages in the main reclamation areas throughout the province. To help this group of immigrants reclaim land, the state has also successively established more than ten tractor stations in the reclamation area, equipped with 367 tractors. In this way, in 1956, a large-scale upsurge in land reclamation throughout the province was formed, and the land reclamation team members marched towards the primitive wasteland with the heroic will of "making the mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way." In this year alone, more than 600,000 hectares of wasteland throughout the province were reclaimed and turned into fertile fields. This speed is unprecedented in the history of Heilongjiang Province.

Reclaiming wasteland is a rather arduous undertaking. This not only requires huge state investment and considerable manpower and material resources; but also because many of these large numbers of reclamation team members who came from within the customs (young students) had never participated in labor, did not know how to reclaim land, and did not understand farming techniques; even those who had participated in agricultural production, their original farming experience was not suitable for the Northeast region, and they needed to learn from scratch. However, after persistent and continuous labor and learning, many team members not only learned how to drive horse-drawn carts, hold plows, harrow the land, sow seeds, fertilize, hoe and harvest grain crops, but also mastered sideline production techniques such as raising pigs, feeding chickens and ducks, weaving straw mats, weaving baskets, and going up the mountains to quarry stones.

It is difficult to statistically account for the grain produced by agricultural cooperatives through near-distance land reclamation and increased production. Here, we will only introduce the situation of grain production increases by state-owned farms and large numbers of immigrant reclamation workers. In 1956 and 1957, 31 state-owned farms newly reclaimed 120,000 hectares of wasteland and produced 220,000 tons of grain for the state. The mechanized farms under the Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau reclaimed 130,000 hectares of wasteland in 1957, and the 70,000 hectares of land sown alone yielded more than 90,000 tons of grain; and the yield per hectare of wheat in some areas was as high as more than 5,000 jin, which is rare in the province. The more than 400 new immigrant villages throughout the province, with the exception of a few areas affected by disasters and poor harvests, basically achieved bumper harvests on the 200,000 hectares of land sown in 1957, with an average yield of about one ton per hectare. Many new immigrant villages are not only self-sufficient, but can also sell large quantities of grain to the state. For example, the 55 new immigrant villages in Gannan County harvested 23,670 tons of grain in 1957, and after deducting grain for farmers to eat this year, livestock feed and seeds, they also sold 15,000 tons of grain to the state (no agricultural tax burden for four years of land reclamation). Beijing Village in Luobei County, which is famous throughout the country, harvested more than 630,000 jin of grain last year, and also sold 300,000 jin to the state after eating and using it. According to a survey of 284 new immigrant villages in 12 counties in the Nenjiang Special Zone, there are 94 villages where the average annual income of each laborer is between 300 and 500 yuan. The income of these immigrants is about the same as, or even exceeds, that of ordinary cooperative members. In Fuyu County's Immigrant Fourth Village, the average annual income per laborer is 590 yuan, an increase of two and a half to three times compared to their income in their old home of Shandong. After these immigrants obtained a bumper harvest, not only was their lives guaranteed, but many people also prepared furniture, clothing, shoes, socks and other daily necessities, and some even remitted money or deposited money to their families. According to a survey of 78 immigrant reclamation team members in 29 villages (village names) in Luobei County, in 1957, in addition to remitting 1,530 yuan to their old home in Shandong, they also deposited 1,200 yuan in the village credit cooperative. Many immigrants are satisfied with coming to the Northeast to reclaim land.

With the development of the land reclamation cause, the increase in immigrant income, and the improvement of living conditions, many immigrants have become more fond of the "Great Northern Wilderness," building houses, bringing their families, and preparing to settle down here for a long time, forming a craze. Among the existing 260,000 immigrants, including the original immigrants who brought their families, more than 33% of the immigrants have brought their families. In order to ensure that immigrant families have houses to live in, 25,000 houses were built in 1957. Many new villages have clubs and canteens; in new villages with families, more than 20 primary schools have also been established; agricultural technology extension stations and health clinics have also been established in the central villages; and supply and marketing cooperatives are available in every village. Some villages have also established amateur drama troupes and other cultural and entertainment organizations. The "Great Northern Wilderness" is not as desolate as it used to be, and its appearance is changing. Taking Luobei County as an example, since the reclamation of land began in the late Qing Dynasty, in the forty years up to liberation, the county had only more than 7,400 people, and less than 4,000 hectares of wasteland had been reclaimed. In the past two years alone, the new villages established by immigrants and youth reclamation teams in this county are more than three times the number of original villages in the county, and the labor force in the county has also increased more than three times; the reclaimed land is also close to three times the area of cultivated land in the past. The county seat, Fengxiang Town, used to be a village with only more than 3,000 people, but it has now developed into a town of about 9,000 people. Here, there are middle schools, primary schools, wired broadcasting stations, post and telecommunications bureaus, Xinhua bookstores, department stores and other stores, everything is available.

    百万公顷荒地变良田
    本报记者　康伟中
    素有“北大荒”之称的黑龙江省，是我国最理想的垦荒地方。全省有可垦荒地一亿亩左右。解放几年来，主要是1956年全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，几乎每个县都掀起了群众性的垦荒增产粮食运动。到1957年，全省开垦的荒地约有一百十八万九千公顷以上，相当于现在耕地面积的六分之一左右。这还仅仅是开发荒地的开始，按照黑龙江省农业规划，要在今后十年内，在大力提高单位面积产量的条件下，再继续开垦荒地一百四十一万多公顷。到那时，黑龙江全省耕地面积将要达到一亿二千多万亩，那时黑龙江省将要变得更加富饶和美丽了。
    黑龙江省有着许多优越的垦荒条件。全省地势平坦，土质肥沃，森林茂盛，江河纵横，雨量够用，交通便利，省内最北地区无霜期一般都在一百二十天左右。这里不但适宜种植小麦、大豆、谷子、高粱等作物，而且水稻也能长得很好。根据这些优越的自然条件，在解放后，党和政府就把领导和组织群众垦荒作为全省增产粮食的重要措施。由于全省地区辽阔、人烟稀少、荒地遍布全省等特点，所以除了各县因地制宜地组织合作社作近距离的小型垦荒之外，经过勘查和规划，国家还在嫩江、合江两个大平原上，建立起三十一个规模较大的国营农场。从1956年开始，以铁道兵复员官兵为主力，又在黑龙江省东南部的密山、宝清、虎林等县建立了几个大规模的机械化国营军垦农场。从北京、天津、河南、河北、山东、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔和佳木斯等地来的、人数在二十六万以上的移民垦荒队员，也是这个省垦荒中的重要力量。这些人分别在全省各主要垦区组成了四百多个移民新村。为帮助这批移民垦荒，国家还先后在垦区建立了十处以上的拖拉机站，配备有三百六十七台拖拉机。这样，在1956年就形成了规模宏大的全省垦荒高潮，垦荒队员们以“让高山低头，叫河水让路”的英雄意志，向原始荒地进军。仅仅这一年，全省就有六十多万公顷荒地被开垦出来变成了良田，这种速度是过去黑龙江省历史上所从来没有的。
    开垦荒地是一件相当艰巨的事业。这不仅需要国家的巨量投资，需要花费相当的人力和物力；而且还因为这些远从关内来的大批垦荒队员，有许多人（青年学生）过去根本没有参加过劳动，不会开荒，不懂耕作技术；就是那些参加过农业生产的，原有的耕作经验也不适于东北地区，还需从头学起。但是，经过顽强不断地劳动学习之后，许多队员不仅会赶马车、扶犁、耙地、播种、施肥、铲趟和粮食作物的收割打场等，而且也掌握了养猪、喂鸡鸭、编草席、编筐和上山打石头等副业生产技术。
    要统计各地农业合作社近距离开荒增产的粮食是比较困难的。这里只介绍一下国营农场和大批移民垦荒增产粮食的情况。1956年和1957年三十一个国营农场新开垦了十二万公顷荒地，就为国家生产粮食二十二万吨。铁道兵农垦局所属机械化农场，1957年开垦了十三万公顷荒地，仅播种的七万公顷土地就收到了九万多吨粮食；而他们每公顷小麦的单位面积产量有的竟高达五千斤以上，这在全省也是少有的。全省四百多个移民新村，除少数地区受灾歉收外，1957年播种的二十万公顷土地基本上得到了丰收，平均每公顷的产量都在一吨左右。许多移民新村不仅够吃够用，而且还可以卖给国家大批粮食。例如甘南县五十五个移民新村，1957年收获的粮食就达两万三千六百七十吨，除农民今年吃粮、牲畜饲料和种籽之外，还向国家卖粮（垦荒四年没有农业税负担）一万五千吨。以全国闻名的萝北县北京村去年收获了六十三万多斤粮食，除吃用外也向国家卖出三十万斤。又据嫩江专区十二个县二百八十四个移民新村的调查，平均每个劳动力年收入在三百元到五百元的就有九十四个村，这些移民的收入都和一般合作社社员的收入差不多，甚至还超过了后者。富裕县移民四村，每个劳动力平均年收入五百九十元，比在老家山东时的收入增加两倍半到三倍。这些移民获得丰收后，不但他们的生活有了保证，而且许多人还制备了家具、衣服、鞋袜等日用品，有的还向家汇款或存款。根据萝北县二十九村（村名）七十八个移民垦荒队员的调查，1957年除向山东老家汇款一千五百三十元外，还在本村信贷社存款一千二百元。许多移民对来东北开荒感到满意。
    随着垦荒事业的发展，移民收入的增加，生活的改善，许多移民更加热爱“北大荒”，兴建房屋，接家属，准备在这里长期安家落户形成了一股热潮。在现有二十六万移民中，连同原有带家属的移民包括在内，已经有33％以上的移民搬来了家属。为了保证移民家属有房子住，1957年修建了两万五千间房子。许多新村设有俱乐部和食堂；在带家属的新村，还建立了二十多座小学校；在中心村还设立农业技术推广站和卫生所；村村都有供销合作社。有些村还成立了业余剧团和其他文化娱乐组织。现在的“北大荒”已不像往日那样荒凉了，它的面貌正在发生变化。以萝北县为例，这个县从清朝末年开始垦荒以来，到解放时的四十年间，全县只有七千四百多人，开垦的荒地不到四千公顷。仅仅是最近两年，这个县的移民和青年垦荒队建立的新村，等于全县原有村庄的三倍多，全县的劳动力也增加三倍以上；开垦的土地，也接近于过去耕地面积的三倍。这个县的县城——凤翔镇，过去原是只有三千多人的村庄，现在已发展成九千人左右的城镇。这里，有中学、小学、有线电广播站、邮电局、新华书店、百货公司和其他商店，样样俱全。
