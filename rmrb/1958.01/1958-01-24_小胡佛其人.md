Personage introduction:

    Little Herbert Hoover is the son of former U.S. President Hoover. Both father and son have close ties with American oil monopoly capital. Mellon, the boss of Gulf Oil Corporation, served as Secretary of the Treasury during the elder Hoover's presidency; and Little Hoover himself is hailed as an "old hand in the oil business" due to his loyal "service" to the oil monopoly groups. Little Hoover's "service" to the oil monopoly groups has been remarkably successful. When he served as an oil advisor to the governments of Venezuela, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Iran, he faithfully carried out the special "diplomatic" missions of American oil monopoly organizations, enabling them to obtain many monopoly rights to exploit oil. The "International Oil Consortium" agreement signed between the United States, Britain, and other countries with Iran in 1954 was Little Hoover's proudest "masterpiece," and he was rewarded with the position of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State in the same year. However, due to the conflict between the Mellon oil group he represented and the Rockefeller oil group, he was forced to leave office last February. He currently serves as Dulles' informal advisor on Middle East oil policy issues. (Fang)

    小胡佛其人
    小赫伯特·胡佛是美国前总统胡佛的儿子。父子两人跟美国的石油垄断资本有密切联系。美国海湾石油公司的老板梅隆曾在小胡佛父亲任总统期间担任了财政部长职务；而小胡佛本人则由于他为石油垄断集团的忠实“服务”，被誉为“石油商业的老手”。小胡佛为石油垄断集团“效劳”是卓有功绩的。他在充任委内瑞拉、智利、秘鲁、巴西和伊朗等国政府的石油问题顾问时，忠实地执行了美国石油垄断组织的特殊“外交”任务，使他们取得了不少开采石油的垄断权利。1954年美英等国同伊朗签订的“国际石油财团”协定，更是小胡佛的得意“杰作”，他因此而在同年得到了美国副国务卿的职位。但由于他代表的梅隆石油集团跟洛克菲勒石油集团有矛盾，他被迫在去年2月去职。现任杜勒斯关于中东石油政策问题的非正式顾问。（芳）
