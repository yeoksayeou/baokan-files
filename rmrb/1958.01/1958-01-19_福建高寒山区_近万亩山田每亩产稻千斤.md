Fujian's High-Altitude Mountainous Areas

	Nearly Ten Thousand Mu of Upland Rice Fields Yield 1,000 Jin per Mu

(Reported by this newspaper) In 1957, nearly ten thousand mu of upland rice fields in the mountainous areas of Fujian Province yielded 1,000 jin per mu. Approximately one hundred mu of single-season late rice fields yielded over 1,000 jin per mu. In the northern Fujian mountainous area, where the province's rice yield has historically been the lowest and the soil quality is poor, over five thousand mu of upland rice fields yielded 1,000 jin per mu in 1957.

The yield of these 1,000-jin rice fields was two to three times higher than the local average yield. In Guangze County, where the mountains are high, the water is cold, and the soil is barren, the average rice yield per mu is just over 200 jin, and even the best upland rice fields yield only 500 jin. Last year, despite a severe drought, more than 114 mu of rice fields still achieved an average yield of over 1,000 jin. Baiyang Township in Jianyang County is a well-known low-yield mountainous area, yet four and a half mu of land averaged 1,099 jin of grain per mu. The four and a quarter mu of upland rice fields belonging to the Fangting Advanced Cooperative in Lindong Township, Anxi County, averaged 2,173 jin of grain per mu, exceeding the 1956 high-yield record of 2,150 jin per mu set by the Hongguang Cooperative in Shantou City, Guangdong, by 23 jin. In addition, tens of thousands of mu of upland rice fields in the province's mountainous areas achieved the grain production targets set by the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) for 1967, ten years ahead of schedule.

### 福建高寒山区  近万亩山田每亩产稻千斤

    福建高寒山区
    近万亩山田每亩产稻千斤
    本报讯　福建省山区1957年出现了近万亩山田千斤稻，其中约有一百亩单季晚稻田每亩产量超过一千斤。全省水稻历年产量最低、土质较差的闽北山区，1957年出现的山田千斤稻即有五千多亩。
    这些千斤稻田，产量都高过当地平均产量两、三倍以上。山高水冷、田瘦土瘠的光泽县，水稻平均每亩产量不过二百多斤，最好的山田也只有五百斤，去年虽然遭受严重干旱，仍有一百一十四亩多稻田平均产量达到一千斤以上。建阳县白洋乡是有名的低产山区，也有四亩六分半田地平均每亩产谷一千零九十九斤。安溪县林东乡芳亭高级社的四亩二分二山田，每亩平均产谷达二千一百七十三斤，比1956年广东汕头市红光社亩产二千一百五十斤的丰产纪录还超过二十三斤。此外，全省山区还有几万亩山田，提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的1967年的粮食增产指标。
