Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 13th. Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have decided to build many new forest farms, sugarcane farms and farms to welcome transferred cadres to participate in labor production.

The Provincial Forestry Department has decided to build 355 new state-owned forest farms this year, which can accommodate 21,300 transferred cadres. These forest farms will be established in Shantou, Huiyang, Zhanjiang, Hainan and other places. The main task of the cadres transferred to the forest farms is to quickly and comprehensively manage the existing 10 million mu of state-owned forests, rationally harvest and utilize them, and prepare to expand state-owned afforestation by 21 million mu during the second and third five-year plans, driving cooperatives to accelerate the construction of Guangdong Province into one of the country's timber production bases.

The five sugarcane farms newly built by the relevant business departments of the province are about to be completed. These five sugarcane farms include two sugarcane breeding farms in Qiongshan County and Xuwen County, and three raw material sugarcane farms in Dongguan, Huiyang and Yaxian, with a total planting area of ​​50,000 mu, which can accommodate 5,000 transferred cadres and are expected to produce 150,000 tons of sugarcane in the first year.

The six state-owned farms in the suburbs of Guangzhou, which are being prepared by the relevant departments of Guangzhou City and will be cultivated by transferred cadres, are now undergoing specific planning work. Most of the locations of these six farms are undeveloped barren mountains with deep soil layers, which are suitable for the growth of general plants. According to preliminary planning, in addition to a comprehensive farm mainly for fish farming and afforestation, the remaining five farms are prepared to plant a large number of fruit trees such as pineapples, lychees, citrus, and oranges, as well as crops such as peanuts and oil tea. Each farm is also preparing to develop animal husbandry on a large scale.

    迎接下放干部参加劳动
    广东将新建三百多林场
    据新华社广州13日电　广东省和广州市决定新建许多林场、甘蔗场和农场，迎接下放干部参加劳动生产。
    省林业厅决定在今年新建国营林场三百五十五个，可以容纳下放干部两万一千三百人。这些林场将建立在汕头、惠阳、湛江、海南等地。下放到林场的干部，主要任务是迅速地、全面地把现有一千万亩国有林很好地管理起来，合理地采伐利用，并且准备在第二个和第三个五年计划期间扩大国营造林二千一百万亩，带动合作社加速地把广东省建设成为国家用材基地之一。
    省有关业务部门新建的五个甘蔗场，即将筹建完成。这五个甘蔗场包括琼山县和徐闻县的两个甘蔗良种繁殖场，东莞、惠阳和崖县的三个原料甘蔗场，全部种植面积共五万亩，可容纳下放干部五千人，预计第一年可以生产甘蔗十五万吨。
    广州市有关部门在市郊筹建的六个由下放干部参加垦荒劳动的国营农场，现已进行具体规划工作。这六个农场的所在地大部分是未开垦的荒山，土层深厚，适宜一般植物生长。据初步规划，除了一个综合性农场以养鱼、植林为主外，其余五个农场都准备大量种植菠萝、荔枝、柑、橙等果树和花生、油茶等作物。各农场还准备大量发展畜牧业。
