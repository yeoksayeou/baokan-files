    Carnivorous Plant – The Pitcher Plant
    Ding Jun
    In the biological world, there are many strange and interesting things. Generally speaking, animals eat plants when it comes to the food of living things; however, there are indeed a few plants that eat animals, and the pitcher plant is such a "weird" plant.

    The pitcher plant is also a very interesting ornamental plant. Each of its leaves has a pitcher-like trap hanging on the tip (see attached picture), which is very cute. In addition to providing us with viewing pleasure, it can also help us in our work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene—eliminating mosquitoes and flies.

    It is a prostrate, dwarf, perennial green shrub. The midrib of its leaves is particularly developed, growing out of the leaves. At the tip of this protruding midrib grows a cylindrical trap with a lid. The trap is about two *shi cun* (about 6.6 cm) long and six *fen* (about 2 cm) thick, shaped like the bamboo cages used in southern China to transport live pigs, hence the name pitcher plant.

    When the pitcher plant is young, it does not have the ability to eat insects; the lid of its trap is closed. After it grows to two or three months old, it begins to eat insects, and the lid opens accordingly. The mouth of the trap has a smooth and thick lip to protect its very thin trap. The inner wall of the trap is covered with wax, which is very smooth. Once an insect falls in, it is almost impossible to climb out. The bottom of the trap can secrete a honey-like liquid containing organic acids, which is specially used to lure small insects such as mosquitoes, flies, and ants. These gluttonous insects crawl into the trap, intending to have a feast of honey, but end up being drowned by the honey. After the insects die, the organic acids in the honey decompose the proteins in the insect bodies, turning them into part of the nutrients needed for the growth and development of the pitcher plant.

    The pitcher plant's hometown is in tropical areas such as Malaya in Southeast Asia and Hainan Island in China. In the lower layer of the large forests of Hainan Island, there are wild pitcher plants. It prefers warm, shady, and humid environments. When it comes to the cold north of our country, it cannot stand the dry weather, the exposure to sunlight, and the severe winter, so it can only be cultivated in greenhouses. The ideal indoor temperature is 30 degrees Celsius, and the lowest should not be lower than 12 degrees Celsius, and shading must be added. For potted soil, it is best to use peat soil with strong water permeability. Alkaline soil is not good for it.

    Its propagation is generally done by dividing the roots. If its branches are cut off in the spring and inserted into sandy soil, maintaining a temperature of 35 degrees Celsius and humid air, it can also take root and become a new pitcher plant.

### 吃动物的植物——猪笼草

    吃动物的植物——猪笼草
    丁君
    生物界中有许许多多稀奇而又有趣的事情。就生物的食物来讲，一般情况是动物吃植物；但是，确有少数植物吃动物，像猪笼草就是这样一种“稀奇古怪”的植物。
    猪笼草而且还是一种非常有趣的观赏植物。它的每一个叶子尖上还挂着一个像瓶子状的捕虫囊（见附图），非常可爱。它除了供我们观赏外，还可以帮助我们在除四害讲卫生的工作中起到它的作用——消灭蚊子和苍蝇。
    它是一种平卧矮生的多年生绿色小灌木，叶子的中脉特别发达，长出叶子之外。在这突出的中脉的尖端上长着一个圆筒形带盖的捕虫囊。囊长约二市寸，粗约六分，形状好像我国南方运输活猪时所用的竹笼子，所以给它取名猪笼草。
    猪笼草在幼小的时候，没有吃虫子的能力，它的捕虫囊的盖是封闭着的。等它长到两、三个月以后，就开始吃虫子，盖子也随着打开。囊的口部有一圈光滑而又粗厚的唇，用以保护它那很薄的囊。囊的内壁上生有蜡质，非常光滑，虫子一旦坠入，简直无法爬出。囊底能分泌一种带有有机酸的蜜汁，专门引诱蚊子、苍蝇、蚂蚁等小昆虫。这些贪吃的小虫爬进囊中，本想大饱一顿蜜汁，结果反被蜜汁溺死。小虫死后，蜜汁中的有机酸就把虫体中的蛋白质分解，变为猪笼草生长发育时所需要的一部分养分。
    猪笼草的故乡是南洋的马来亚和我国海南岛等热带地方。在海南岛的大森林的下层，就有野生的猪笼草。它最喜欢温暖、荫蔽和潮湿的环境。来到我国寒冷的北方，它受不了干燥的天气、日光的曝晒和冬天的严寒，因此只能在温室内栽培。室内温度最理想是摄氏三十度，最低不能低于十二度，并且要加荫蔽。盆栽土壤，最好是用透水性很强的泥炭土，碱性土对它是不利的。
    它的繁殖，一般用分根的办法。如果在春天将它的枝条剪下，插在砂土内，保持摄氏三十五度的温度和潮湿的空气，也能生根成为一棵新的猪笼草。
