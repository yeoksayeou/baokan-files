Is "Living Within Your Means" Right?

When it comes to frugality in daily life, people generally take "living within your means" as the standard. At first glance, this sounds good. If you can plan your expenses based on your income, and not let your expenses exceed your income, you presumably won't be in debt, which is good.

I used to think so too, but now I have doubts.

Take myself as an example. I am a cadre in an organization, with a monthly income of over ninety-nine yuan. I'm single and have no burdens. Besides eating well and dressing nicely, I also add some decorative items to my liking. With plenty of money and a loose hand, I am, of course, very comfortable. Some people envy me, and I boast, "This is the advantage of being single!" When someone criticizes me, I argue forcefully, "I haven't been eating or using things extravagantly, and I haven't been living in debt." Indeed, although I spend all my money every month, I am living within my means and not in debt. Therefore, I think I am very planned in my spending and am very self-disciplined!

Later, I discovered that my colleague, Lao Zhang, with a monthly income of just over fifty yuan, manages his family of six very well. His wife is a housewife, diligent and simple. His three older children are already in school, and one child is at home. He himself is dressed in cloth clothes, old but clean. I never see him worry about rice or firewood, and I have never seen him borrow a penny from anyone. Several times, the trade union wanted to subsidize him, but he refused. After hearing this, I specifically asked him, "How can you manage with so little money? You must have a knack for managing the household. What method do you use?" He widened his eyes and said, "So little money? It's not little, young man. As for methods, there's nothing special, just living within your means!"

I suddenly realized: "Living within your means" does not apply to everyone. For families whose income is not enough to cover expenses, "living within your means" is a good way to avoid debt. For families whose income is just enough to cover expenses, they can avoid debt, so just mentioning "living within your means" is not enough; they should also try to squeeze out some money to save for emergencies. As for those whose income far exceeds their expenses (like me), talking about "living within your means" is something to be ashamed of and should be a subject of self-reflection. If such people insist on living within their means, they are simply looking for excuses for their extravagant spending. Even if not, at least they are cultivating the extravagant habits of a young master who spends money lavishly. What is commendable about that?

In short, generally advocating "living within your means" is too broad, and the positive significance is not enough. Only when money is scarce and there are many people, and by adhering to the spirit of "thrift," can we achieve "living within your means," which is worth advocating.

### “量入为出”对吗？

    “量入为出”对吗？
    居家过日子，讲到节俭，一般总以“量入为出”作标准。乍一听，这提法不错。能根据自家的收入来计划自家的支出，不叫支出超过收入，想必就不会负债，是不错。
    我从前也这样认为，但现在怀疑了。
    就拿我自己说。我是机关干部，月入九十九元多。单身一人，别无负担。除开吃得可口、穿得讲究，还随心所欲地添置一些摆设用品。钱多手松，当然就宽绰得很。有人羡慕我，我就夸耀：“这就是光杆的优越性嘛！”有人批评我，我还振振有辞：“我又没有乱吃乱用，又没有借债过日子”。确实，我虽然月月花光，但总算是量入为出的，并没有欠债。因而自以为用钱还很有计划，安份守己得很呢！
    后来发现，我的同事老张月入不过五十多元，却把他那六口之家安排得妥妥贴贴。他爱人是家庭妇女，勤劳朴实。他三个大孩子已经上学，一个小孩在家。他自己布衣布履，虽旧而整洁。平日也从没见他愁米愁柴，更没见他向谁借过一个子儿。好几回工会要补助他，他不要。我听说后，特地去问他：“你这么点钱怎么够用？是治家有方吧？用的什么法儿？”他瞪大了眼：“这么点钱？不少了，小伙子。说起法儿，没别的，量入为出呗！”
    我这才恍然大悟：量入为出并不适用于任何人。对于收入不太够开支的人家来说，量入为出是个好办法，可以不致负债。对于收入刚够开支的人家来说，本可以不负债，因此光提“量入为出”还不够，还应该尽可能地挤出些钱来储蓄，以防不时之需。至于对那些收入远远超过开支的人（如我）来说，也侈谈什么量入为出，应该自感惭愧、自觉检讨。这种人如果非要量入为出，那实是为自己的胡花乱用找借口罢了。即便不是，那至少是在培养大手大脚用钱的大少爷气派，有何可取？
    总之，一般的提量入为出，太笼统，积极意义也不够。只有在钱少人多的情况下，按照“节俭”精神，做到“量入为出”，才值得提倡。
