Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 9th: A smuggling group that stole and transported ancient Chinese cultural relics was recently cracked down by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and seventeen smugglers and unscrupulous merchants have been arrested according to law.

This smuggling group was composed of a group of illegal speculative merchants from Hong Kong and Guangzhou. They traveled between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, carrying diamonds, rhinoceros horns and other goods for import from Hong Kong. Through secret transactions with illegal antique dealers and speculators in Guangzhou, they acquired ancient Chinese cultural relics and smuggled them out of the country. The cultural relics they stole and sold, based solely on materials seized by customs over the past two years and confessions from these unscrupulous merchants, include painted pottery from the Neolithic Age, bronze mirrors from the Han and Tang dynasties, oracle bone fragments from the Shang Dynasty, and pottery and porcelain from various dynasties.

These smugglers were extremely cunning. They disguised some precious cultural relics as ordinary utensils, or put salted fish and rotten vegetables inside them, or placed some cultural relics in messy luggage, attempting to deceive the inspectors. However, under the strict inspection of public security personnel and customs officials, this group of speculators who betrayed the interests of the people of the motherland finally could not escape the net of the people's law.

    广州破获盗卖文物的走私集团
    十七名走私分子和不法商人被依法逮捕
    本报特约新华社广州9日电一个盗运我国古代文物的走私集团，最近被广州市公安机关破获，十七名走私分子和不法商人已依法逮捕。
    这个走私集团是由香港和广州的一批不法投机商人组成的。他们来往于香港、广州之间，从香港携带钻石、犀角和其他货物进口，通过和广州的不法古玩商人和投机分子进行秘密交易，收购我国古代文物偷运出境。被他们盗卖的文物，仅从海关两年来查获和这些不法商人供认的材料，就有新石器时代的彩陶器，汉、唐时代的铜镜，商代的甲骨文字片，和各朝代的陶、瓷器等。
    这些走私分子是十分狡猾的，他们把一些珍贵的文物充作普通器具，或在里面放上咸鱼、烂菜，或者将一些文物放在乱七八糟的杂物行李中，企图混过检查人员。但是，在公安人员和海关人员的严密检查下，这批背叛祖国人民利益的投机分子终于逃不出人民的法网。
