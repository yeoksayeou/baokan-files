On the Performance of "Liren Xing"
    Feng Zi

Ten years ago, I saw the performance of "Liren Xing" in Shanghai. Today, watching "Liren Xing" again in Beijing feels like seeing a new play for the first time. I found it so fresh and the entire performance so captivating.

Comrade Tian Han's works have their characteristics: abundant emotion, clear love and hate. This is true of "Liren Xing," "The Death of a Famous Actor," and some of his other works.

The China Youth Art Theater's performance of "Liren Xing," from the perspective of the performance itself, and from the artistic creations of the director, actors, and stage staff, has its unique creations in embodying the author's creative intentions and expressing the theme and artistic conception of the work.

First and foremost, it is worth mentioning their bold use of new forms of expression, replacing scenery with slides in stage design. This attempt, applied to a play with many scenes, complex character threads, and a broader social background to be expressed, is very harmonious. This attempt makes the performance form of "Liren Xing" more lively, and the performance time is also more compact.

Comrade Tian Han is familiar with the expressive forms of opera. How drama should inherit and carry forward national forms is a question that remains to be explored. Although "Liren Xing" was written by the author in the form of a living newspaper, it is undeniable that "Liren Xing" embodies the author's intention to learn the expressive methods of opera forms. Of course, the performance of multi-scene dramas should not be limited to one style. The Youth Art Theater's performance this time provides new approaches and enriches our stage art. In the past, our stage was once too limited to "the reality of life," and in fact, what was limited was the creativity of the artists (including stage design artists), and the imagination of the audience.

The China Youth Art Theater's performance of "Liren Xing" has some adjustments and changes in certain scenes. From the perspective of the performance effect, some changes are necessary. For example, the third scene is moved to the first scene, that is, immediately after Jinmei is insulted, it shows how the Party's underground workers are planning the struggle against the enemy. This change better highlights the power of the Party representing the interests of the people. Another example is merging the last two scenes into one, inserting the twenty-first scene into the twentieth scene, which not only makes people feel compact but also makes the thread of Jinmei's character connect from beginning to end. What is even more worthy of attention is the ending of the play. The director uses a mass scene, extending the time in the play by one year, to the day of Japan's surrender in 1945. All Chinese people who experienced the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan will never forget the joy and sorrow intertwined on this day. Was Shanghai also like this? Could the people of Shanghai possibly celebrate so joyfully? The question is not whether it is possible or not. This joy is the national sentiment of all Chinese people, and the people of Shanghai will not be an exception, nor should they be an exception. The so-called reality of life, in this question, its true starting point should be here. The director displayed their political enthusiasm in these places and also demonstrated their talent in artistic creation. Such treatment is supported by the audience.

Regarding the character of Zhou Fan, it seems that the director also made some deletions and changes, and some places seem cleaner, such as scene seventeen (this scene deleted the landlord and the little kid). However, on the whole, the thread of this character is still not clear enough. Because he "cannot control his emotions towards Xinqun and almost embarked on the road of betraying the revolution..." the script stipulates such a character, but he is not distinct enough on the stage. Xinqun mentioned Zhou Fan to Brother Liu several times. What exactly is Zhou Fan's problem? Judging from the lines and actions, it feels that the explanation is not enough. It is difficult for the audience to see that Zhang Yuliang was arrested because he followed Xinqun, and that the entire organization was destroyed because he followed Xinqun. It is also difficult for the audience to see whether he is the object of the spy's pursuit or a turncoat who has already defected and become the spy's henchman? Even until scene seventeen, when he risked his life to fight the spy and protected the organization, the audience still cannot be sure whether he has politically degenerated and is redeeming himself with his life. For intellectuals from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, the character of Zhou Fan has a certain educational significance. Some details interspersed about this character need to have clear clues.

The three leading actresses all performed very movingly. Comrade Lu Xi's portrayal of Liang Ruoying is successful. The two scenes in prison and the scene in the cafe after her release profoundly expose the "depths of the soul" of this type of character. The actress did not intentionally criticize this character, nor did she deliberately seek the audience's sympathy, and the sense of proportion was grasped just right. Comrade Liu Yansheng, who played Xinqun, has an excellent image, but she needs to be more calm. Li Yun's Jinmei should be the most sympathetic character for the audience, and the actress also created a simple and pure image of a female worker. Child actors are the most difficult to handle. Beibei is already a twelve-year-old girl, and she often says some adult words. Children will not realize that they are children, so there is no need to pretend to be more childish in tone. That way, it might sound more natural and get more sympathy from the audience.

To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the drama movement, the Beijing People's Art Theater and the China Youth Art Theater have successively staged works by Comrade Tian Han and Comrade Ouyang Yuqian. It is such a rare thing to be able to see works from different periods of a writer in a short time! If we could stage Comrade Tian Han's early works again, it would not only help the audience and readers to better understand the writer, but also allow us to see the development of the drama movement over the past fifty years through the works of writers from different periods (of course, not just Comrade Tian Han alone). This is what comrades who are interested in studying the history of Chinese drama hope for.

### 谈“丽人行”的演出

    谈“丽人行”的演出
    凤子
    十年前我在上海看过“丽人行”的演出，今天在北京重看“丽人行”，却像第一次看一个新戏上演一般，感到那样的新鲜，整个的演出那样的吸引着我。
    田汉同志的作品有他的特点，感情充沛，爱憎分明。“丽人行”如此，“名优之死”如此，其他有些作品亦复如此。
    中国青年艺术剧院演出的“丽人行”，从演出来看，从导演、演员、舞台工作的艺术创造的成果来看，在体现作者的创作意图，在表达作品的主题和意境方面，是有其独到的创造的。
    首先值得一提的，是他们大胆运用了新的表现形式，在舞台设计方面，以幻灯代替了景片。这个尝试，运用在这个场次较多、人物线索较复杂、所要表现的社会背景方面较为广泛的戏里，是非常谐调的。这个尝试使得“丽人行”演出形式更其活泼，演出时间也更紧凑了。
    田汉同志是熟悉戏曲的表现形式的，话剧如何继承并发扬民族形式这个问题尚待探索，“丽人行”虽然作者是运用活报的形式来写的，不可否认的，“丽人行”体现了作者学习戏曲形式的表现方法的意图。当然，多场次的话剧的演出，其方式应该不拘于一格。青年艺术剧院这次的演出，提供了新的做法，丰富了我们的舞台艺术。我们的舞台，过去一度的曾经过于局限于“生活的真实”，实际上被局限的是艺术家们的创造力（也包括舞台设计艺术家在内），被局限的是观众的想像力。
    青年艺术剧院演出的“丽人行”，某些场次有些调动和改动，从演出效果来看，有些改动是必要的。例如第三场倒为第一场，即金妹被侮辱后紧接着是党的地下工作者如何策划着对敌斗争，这样改动更显出代表人民利益的党的力量。又如结尾两场合并为一场，第二十场插入二十一场，不止是使人感到紧凑而已，同时使得金妹这个人物的线索，首尾衔接起来。更值得重视的是全剧的结尾，导演运用了群众场面，将剧中时间延长了一年，是1945年日本投降的一天。这一年的这一天，凡是经历过八年抗战的中国人，都忘不了这一天的狂欢和辛酸交织的心情，上海是不是也如此呢？上海人民可能不可能也如此狂欢地来庆祝呢？问题不在可能与否。这狂欢是全中国人民的民族感情，上海人民也不会例外，也不应例外。所谓生活的真实，在这个问题上，其真实的出发点应在此。导演在这些地方发挥了他们的政治热情，也表现出在艺术创造上的才华，这样的处理，是得到观众们的拥护的。
    关于周凡这个人物，看来导演也作了一些删动，有些地方似乎更干净一些，如第十七场（这场删去了房东、小毛头）。不过，整个说来，这个人物的线索还是不够清楚。由于他对新群“不能控制自己的感情几乎走上了叛变革命的道路……”剧本规定的这样一个人物，在舞台上却是不够鲜明的。新群几次同刘大哥谈到周凡，周凡究竟是什么问题，从台词动作来要求，就感到交代的不够。观众很难看出由于他跟踪新群，使得章玉良被捕，由于他跟踪新群，使得整个组织遭到破坏。观众也难看出他到底是特务的目的物，还是个已经叛变成为特务的鹰犬的变节者？一直到第十七场，他以身命同特务拼了，掩护了组织，观众也还难肯定他是否是在政治上堕落了又以身赎罪。对于小资产阶级出身的知识分子来说，周凡这个人物是有一定的教育意义的。关于这个人物一些细节穿插需要线索分明些。
    三位女主角演的都很感人，路曦同志扮演的梁若英是成功的。在监狱里两场戏，和出狱后在咖啡馆里的一场戏，相当深刻的暴露了若英这一类型人物的“灵魂深处”。留恋舒适的生活，精神上、物质上都不太能经受熬炼。演员并未有意的批判这个人物，也并未故意争取观众的同情，分寸掌握恰到好处。饰演新群的刘燕生同志，形象极好，只是需要再沉着一些。李筠同志的金妹应是最能获得观众同情的角色了，演员也创造了一个简单纯朴的女工形象。小演员是最难处理的，贝贝已是十二岁的女孩子，而且她常说一些大人话。孩子们不会意识到自己是小孩，因此语调不必要装的更幼小，那末可能听来会更自然，会得到观众更多的同情的吧。
    为了纪念话剧运动五十年，北京人民艺术剧院和中国青年艺术剧院先后排演了田汉同志、欧阳予倩同志的作品，很短的时间内，能看到一个作家不同时期的作品，多么难得的事！假如能再排演田汉同志早期的作品，不止是帮助了观众和读者们更好地理解作家，从而也可以通过作家（当然不止田汉同志一位）不同时期的作品来看话剧运动五十年的发展，这将是有兴趣研究中国话剧史的同志们所希望的。
