	Why Winter Vegetables Taste Especially Sweet

	As the saying goes, "Frost-kissed and snow-pressed, green vegetables taste sweet." Why do green vegetables taste especially sweet in winter?

	Before winter arrives, the weather is warm and the soil is fertile, allowing green vegetables to rapidly produce and store a large amount of nutrients – starch – within their bodies. When the weather turns cold, this starch is gradually broken down into sugar, which is why they taste particularly sweet.

	The decomposition of starch into sugar is a plant's innate ability to prevent itself from freezing. We all know that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius; however, sugar water or salt water requires an even lower temperature to freeze. This shows that the more concentrated a liquid is, the lower its freezing point. The cells of green vegetables are often filled with water and starch, but because starch is insoluble in water, it cannot increase the concentration of the cell sap. However, when frost and snow appear, the cells are stimulated, and the starch hydrolyzes to form sugars, increasing the concentration of the cell sap and lowering the freezing point within the plant, thus preventing frost damage. This is the plant's instinctive adaptation to environmental changes. However, the adaptability of plants is limited. For example, sometimes when sudden cold strikes, green vegetables and radishes do not have time to react, and the cell sap within them freezes.

    为什么冬天的青菜格外甜
    俗话说：“霜打雪压青菜甜”。为什么到了冬天青菜就格外甜呢？
    入冬以前，天暖地肥，青菜赶制了大量养料——淀粉储于体内。到天寒地冻时，淀粉就逐步分解成糖，所以吃起来就感到特别甜。
    把淀粉分解成糖，是植物体防止自身被冻的一种本能。我们都知道，一杯纯水在摄氏零度就能结冰；但是一杯糖水或盐水，就需要更低的温度才能结冰。由此可知：液体愈浓，结冰的温度也就愈低。在青菜的细胞内外，常充满着水分和淀粉，因为淀粉不溶于水，所以不能使细胞液变浓。但到凝霜下雪之时，细胞体受到刺激，淀粉便产生水解形成糖类，增加了细胞液的浓度，降低了体内冰点，因而防止了冻害。这便是植物体对付环境变化的一种适应本能。不过植物的这种适应性是有限度的。比如有时遇到骤寒，青菜萝卜还没有来得及应变，体内细胞液就已受冻结冰。
