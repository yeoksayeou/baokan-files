    Party Committee Personally Takes Charge to Lead Anti-Waste Campaign
    Anhui Industrial and Mining Enterprise Employees Expose Numerous Facts
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch on the 18th) The industrial and transportation sectors of Anhui Province have seized the momentum of the rectification campaign to ignite a fire against waste. To strengthen leadership over the anti-waste campaign, local prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees have designated a secretary or minister to be responsible for this work, and have dispatched cadres to various factories and mines to provide concrete assistance.
    More than seventy factories and enterprises in Hefei City have already taken action. In less than three days, the Hefei Mining Machinery Plant posted nearly a thousand big-character posters denouncing waste. Employees revealed that the plant had wasted approximately 600,000 yuan over the past five years, accounting for one-sixth of its working capital. In 1956, the plant undertook to manufacture more than 100,000 plowshares for double-wheeled, double-furrow plows. Leading cadres and technical personnel blindly believed that since the plant manufactured large machinery, making small tools would be no problem. Without successful trial production, they launched into production, resulting in substandard plowshares that were all scrapped, causing a loss of 110,000 yuan. Big-character posters from the metalworking workshop revealed that in 1957, the workshop used 2,100 alloy steel blades, of which 630 were damaged due to improper use and poor storage, resulting in a total loss of 7,815 yuan. Other areas have also exposed many instances of waste. For example, the foundation project for the small blast furnace in Ma'anshan, undertaken by the Wuhu Construction Company, suffered serious rework waste due to poor quality, resulting in a loss of more than 22,000 yuan in state funds, and delaying the date on which the blast furnace could be put into production. Since its establishment last year, the Anqing Sugar Factory has wasted more than 170,000 yuan due to poor management and inadequate planning. Last year, the value of wasted water and electricity in the collective dormitory of the Wuhu Textile Factory could have bought 21,000 jin of rice.
    Based on the province-wide anti-waste situation, the leading personnel of most units are able to boldly mobilize employees to speak out and actively make improvements. However, some ideological obstacles remain among a few cadres. Some are afraid of being punished if waste is exposed, and dare not mobilize the masses, fearing to "get burned." Some emphasize that they are too busy with work to have time. Some believe that employees have already made many anti-waste criticisms during the airing of views, and that there is currently no waste to combat. Some believe that large factories have waste, but small factories do not, or if there is waste, the amount is insignificant. Local Party committees have taken note of this situation and are working to correct it.

### 党委亲自出马领导反浪费  安徽工矿企业职工揭露大量事实

    党委亲自出马领导反浪费
    安徽工矿企业职工揭露大量事实
    本报合肥18日电　安徽省工业交通部门已经趁整风运动之风点燃起反浪费之火。各地委、市委、县委为了加强对反浪费的领导，都确定由一位书记或部长负责这一工作，并且派出干部到各个厂矿企业去具体帮助。
    合肥市七十多个工厂企业的职工已经行动起来。合肥市矿山机器厂不到三天就贴出了近千张反浪费的大字报。职工们揭发出这个厂五年来浪费约六十万元，占流动资金的六分之一。这个厂1956年承做双轮双铧犁犁镜十万多块，领导干部和技术人员都盲目地认为，本厂是制造大型机器的工厂，做小工具没有问题，不等试制成功就投入生产，结果使制成的犁镜不合标准，全部报废，损失达十一万元。金工车间的大字报揭发：1957年这个车间使用了合金钢刀二千一百把，其中有六百三十把因为使用不善、保管不好而被损坏，共损失七千八百一十五元。其他地区也揭发出了许多浪费现象。如芜湖市建筑公司承建的马鞍山小型高炉基础工程，由于质量低劣，造成严重的返工浪费，损失了国家资金二万二千多元，同时延迟了高炉投入生产的日期。安庆糖厂去年建厂以来，因管理不善，计划不周，浪费了十七万多元。芜湖纺织厂的集体宿舍去年浪费水电的价值，可买两万一千斤大米。
    根据全省反浪费的情况看来，一般单位的领导人员都能大胆放手地发动职工鸣放，并且积极改进。但是，在少数干部当中还有些思想障碍。有的怕浪费现象揭发出来以后会受到处分，不敢发动群众，“引火烧身”；有的强调工作忙没有时间；有的认为鸣放中职工提了不少反浪费的批评，目前已经无浪费可反；有的认为大厂有浪费，小厂没有，就是有浪费为数也不大。这种情况，各地党委已经注意纠正。
