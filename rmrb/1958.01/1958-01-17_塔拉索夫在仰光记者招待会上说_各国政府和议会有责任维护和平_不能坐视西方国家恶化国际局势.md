Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, January 15th: Tarasov, Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, who is currently visiting here, said here on the 15th: "Under the current circumstances, the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world not only bear responsibility for the fate of their own people, but also for the fate of world peace." They cannot sit back and watch Western countries "worsen the international situation."

Tarasov made this statement at a press conference. He also mentioned that the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation discussed relations between the two countries with Burmese leaders and members of the Burmese parliament, and exchanged views particularly on measures to safeguard international peace.

The head of the Soviet delegation said that if the Soviet Union's recent "extremely constructive and very acceptable proposal for maintaining peace had received serious, realistic, and fair consideration, the 'Cold War' could have ended long ago, and concrete results could have been achieved in easing international tensions. However, not only has this not been done, but Western countries have also played various tricks to evade the essence of the issue."

When talking about the friendship between the Soviet Union and Burma, Tarasov said that two major events, the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Burmese people's attainment of independence, enabled the Soviet Union and Burma to establish equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly relations, which are developing year by year.

Since arriving here on January 1, the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation has visited Rangoon, Mandalay, Shan State, and other cities in Burma. They are scheduled to leave here on the 16th.

    塔拉索夫在仰光记者招待会上说
    各国政府和议会有责任维护和平  不能坐视西方国家恶化国际局势
    据新华社仰光15日电　正在这里访问的苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席、苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长塔拉索夫15日在这里说：“在目前情况下，全世界各国的议会和政府不仅对它们自己人民的命运负有责任，而且也对全世界和平的命运负有责任”。它们不能够坐视西方国家使“国际局势恶化”。
    塔拉索夫是在记者招待会上发表的声明中这样说的。他还谈到，苏联最高苏维埃代表团同缅甸领导人和缅甸议会议员们谈到了两国间的关系问题，特别就保卫国际和平的措施问题交换了意见。
    苏联代表团团长说，如果苏联最近提出的关于维护和平的“极其有建设性而且十分可以接受的建议获得了认真、现实而公正的考虑的话，那么早就可以结束了‘冷战’并且在缓和国际紧张局势方面取得了具体成果。但是，不但没有作到这一点，西方国家还耍了各种花招来规避问题的实质。”
    塔拉索夫在谈到苏联和缅甸之间的友谊的时候说，伟大十月社会主义革命和缅甸人民获得独立这样两个重大事件使苏联和缅甸之间能够建立平等、互利和友好的关系，这种关系正在逐年发展。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团自从1月1日到达这里以来，曾经访问了仰光、曼德勒、掸邦和缅甸其他城市。他们预定在16日离开这里。
