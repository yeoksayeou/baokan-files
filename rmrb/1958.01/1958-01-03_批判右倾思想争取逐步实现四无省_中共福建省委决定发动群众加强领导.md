    Immediately mobilize the entire Party and all the people to launch a patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, and strengthen leadership over this movement to ensure the victorious realization of the plan to eliminate the four pests in Fujian Province within ten years, starting from 1958. This was decided by the Standing Committee of the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee at its meeting on December 30.

    Since the implementation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in Fujian Province in 1956, a patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests has been widely launched in various regions, achieving considerable results. According to incomplete statistics, more than 29 million rats and sparrows have been captured in the past two years, and a large number of mosquitoes and flies have been eliminated. More than 200 advanced regions and units, as well as thousands of activists in eliminating the four pests, have emerged during the movement. Currently, there are already many villages, towns, and agricultural cooperatives without flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows throughout the province. Many experiences have been created in factories and rural areas that combine the elimination of the four pests with production, making the movement regular. However, rightist thoughts in leadership at all levels have also hindered greater achievements in eliminating the four pests. Therefore, the meeting criticized those rightist thoughts that did not believe in the possibility of eliminating the four pests and intentionally or unintentionally abandoned the movement to eliminate the four pests, or lacked confidence in this movement, lacked effective measures, or only shouted slogans without mobilizing and relying on the masses. The meeting pointed out that thoroughly overcoming rightist thoughts in the leadership of Party and government at all levels is an important key to ensuring the sustained development of the movement and the smooth elimination of the four pests. The meeting called on Party committees at all levels to immediately conduct large-scale ideological mobilization for the elimination of the four pests among the entire Party and all the people, fully rely on the masses, and launch a movement to eliminate the four pests throughout the province.

    The meeting especially emphasized that the elimination of the four pests should be combined with production, and opposed the single-handed approach of engaging in production without eliminating the four pests, or eliminating the four pests without engaging in production. The meeting called for conscientiously promoting the planned mass campaigns to eliminate the four pests that combine production with mass customs, and combine the campaigns with regular work. The meeting also required all regions to carry out two to three mass campaigns lasting one to two months each year: one during the New Year to Spring Festival period, and the other two could be conducted during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, respectively. During the campaign to eliminate the four pests from now until the Spring Festival, all regions in the province are required to mobilize every household and everyone to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies, dig up fly pupae, eliminate mosquito larvae, capture sparrows and rats, destroy bird nests, block rat holes, remove all indoor and outdoor garbage and dust, dredge ditches, drain sewage, and remove weeds. At the same time, it is advocated that people and livestock should live separately, with pigs having pens, cattle having fences, and manure pits covered, to destroy the breeding and habitat of the four pests, improve environmental sanitation, create more villages, cooperatives, townships, districts, counties, factories, shops, schools, and streets without the four pests, and strive to gradually realize a "Four-Withouts" Province.

    In order to strengthen the ideological leadership and specific guidance of the movement, the meeting decided to establish patriotic health campaign committees for the elimination of the four pests at all levels from the province to the townships, headed by the first secretary of the Party committee and including the responsible persons of the government, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and relevant departments of the Party and government, and to establish strong working bodies led by the health departments. The meeting pointed out that in the movement, attention must be paid to commending various advanced individuals, promoting various advanced experiences, and giving appropriate rewards to advanced individuals and advanced units. All economic units should support this mass movement and promptly supply various medicines and equipment. The urban people should support the vast number of farmers in eliminating the four pests in terms of technology and manpower, and strive to realize the Agricultural Development Program. The meeting required the elimination of four pests committees at all levels to be earnestly responsible to the end and never give up until victory.

    批判右倾思想争取逐步实现四无省
    中共福建省委决定发动群众加强领导
    本报特约新华社专稿　全党全民立即动员起来，开展一个除四害的爱国卫生运动，并加强对这一运动的领导，以保证从1958年起十年内在福建全省范围内胜利实现除四害的规划。这是中共福建省委在12月30日举行的常委会决定的。
    福建省从1956年贯彻全国农业发展纲要（草案）以来，各地普遍开展了除四害的爱国卫生运动，获得不少的成绩。据不完全的统计，两年来共捕鼠、雀二千九百多万只，并消灭了大量的蚊子和苍蝇。运动中涌现了二百多个先进地区和单位，及数以千计的除四害的积极分子，现在全省已有不少的无蝇无蚊无鼠无雀的乡、镇和农业合作社。在工厂和农村中都创造了不少除四害和生产相结合使运动经常化的经验。但各级领导上的右倾思想也阻碍了消灭四害获得更大的成绩，因此会议批判了那些不相信能够消灭四害，而有意和无意丢掉了除四害运动，或对这一运动缺乏信心，措施不力，或空叫喊而不发动和依靠群众等等右倾思想。会议指出，彻底克服各级党政领导上的右倾思想，是保证运动持久的开展和顺利消灭四害的重要关键。会议要求各级党委立即在全党和全民中，广泛进行大规模的消灭四害的思想动员，充分依靠群众，在全省范围内掀起一个除四害的运动。
    会议特别强调除四害要和生产相结合，反对搞生产不消灭四害和除四害不搞生产的单打一作法。会议要求认真推广那些结合生产和群众习俗，有计划地开展群众性的除四害的突击运动，并把突击运动和经常化结合起来。会议还要求各地一年开展二次到三次为期一个月到二个月的群众性的突击运动：一次是在新年到春节期间，其他两次可分别在端阳节和中秋节进行。在从现在起到春节期间的除四害突击运动中，要求全省各地户户动员、人人动手，消灭过冬的蚊子和苍蝇，挖蝇蛹，消灭孑孓，捕捉麻雀、老鼠，捣毁雀巢、堵塞鼠洞，清除室内外所有垃圾、尘土，疏通沟渠、排除污水、铲除杂草，同时提倡人畜分居，作到猪有圈，牛有栏，粪坑加盖，以毁灭四害孳生和栖息的场所，改善环境卫生，创造更多的四无村、四无社、四无乡、四无区、四无县、四无厂、四无店、四无校、四无街，争取逐步实现四无省。
    为了加强对运动的思想领导和具体指导，会议决定从省到乡成立各级以党委第一书记为首的包括政府、各民主党派、各人民团体及党政有关部门负责人参加的除四害爱国卫生运动委员会，并设立以卫生部门为主体的强有力的办事机构。会议指出运动中必须注意表扬各种先进人物，推广各种先进经验，并给予先进人物和先进单位以适当奖励。各经济单位要支持这一群众运动，及时供应各种药械。城市人民在技术和人力上应支持广大农民消灭四害，为实现农业发展纲要而努力。会议要求各级除四害委员会要切实负责到底，不胜利，决不罢休。
