    Firing Bricks: An Inspiration
    Yao Hong, Xiaoshajiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Longhui County, Hunan

    Once, I walked into a brick factory and saw thousands of workers constantly transporting newly fired bricks to a new construction site.

    There were two kinds of bricks: one was dark gray, which people commonly called "green bricks"; the other was reddish-brown, small and exquisite, which people usually called "red bricks."

    I liked the red bricks. In construction, these bricks were both beautiful and durable.

    An old worker told me, "These bricks are made by transforming old bricks. The transformation of these bricks is to suit the needs of our country's construction."

    I asked, "Can you make bricks from just any kind of mud?"

    He smiled and said, "Look at the color of our mud and compare it to ordinary mud." I looked carefully and said, "Yours has been processed."

    "The problem isn't just processing. For example, sandy mud is not as good as the mud from this place. The mud here fires well and is more durable."

    "What happens if the firing is insufficient?"

    "It won't be red, or if it is red, it'll be half-baked. Half-baked bricks crumble into powder with a single knock and are useless." He shook his head repeatedly, and then picked up a piece of light red brick next to him, twisting it into powder with his hand: "This is because the fire wasn't hot enough. Although it's been through the furnace and looks like a brick on the surface, it's not durable in practice. If you use it to build a house, it won't stand the test."

    After hearing what the old worker said, I thought about the many experts and cadres in our country. Although they have been tempered in the furnace of revolution for several years, they are, as the old worker said, still a bit "half-baked" and cannot withstand the test in the face of storms.

    Seeing the news in the newspapers about some university professors going to the countryside to participate in labor production, I thought of what the old worker said again.

    If bricks are to be red, they must be tempered in the furnace.

### 烧砖的启示

    烧砖的启示
    湖南隆回县小沙江供销社  姚洪
    有一次，我走到一个红砖厂，看见成千的工人都在把刚出窑的砖源源不断地运到新建的工地。
    砖有两种，一种是一口青的，人们习惯叫它青砖；一种砖带赭红色，小巧玲珑，人们习惯称它红砖。
    我喜欢红砖，在建筑中这种砖既美观又耐用。
    老工人告诉我：“这种砖是把老砖改造过来的，改造这种砖是为了适合我们国家建筑的需要。”
    我问：“随便用什么泥能烧成砖么？”
    他笑了一笑，说：“你看我们这种泥色与平常的泥色怎样。”我仔细地看了看，说：“你这是经过加工的。”
    “问题还不是加工，比方说，沙泥总没有这地方的泥好，这地方的泥火色好、更耐用。”
    “那么火色不足又会怎样？”
    “不会红，如果说红，也有点夹生。夹生砖一敲就碎成粉，没什么用。”他连连地摇着头，顺便拾起旁边一截淡红的砖，用手一拧就成了粉末：“这是火功不足，虽然经过红炉，表面上像块砖，实际上不耐用，如果用他来建造房屋，是经不起考验的”。
    我听了老工人这段话，想到我们国家有很多的专家、干部，几年来他们虽经过革命这座炉的锻炼，正如这位老工人说的，还有点“夹生”，在急风暴雨中，还经不起考验。
    看到报上登的一些大学教授下到农村劳动生产的新闻，我又想到这位老工人的话。
    砖既然要红，非到炉火中锻炼不可。
