    Agrees to Set Up Missile Base in the Country
    Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, January 27th: Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu said on the 26th that Turkey has agreed to set up missile bases on its territory.

Regarding the issue of establishing links between the Baghdad Pact, NATO, and SEATO, Zorlu said: "The Baghdad Pact itself is a concrete link with the other two organizations. We have already established various contacts between NATO and the Baghdad Pact through the exchange of information." As for the connection with SEATO, Zorlu said that SEATO should take the initiative, and we must study it.
    Zorlu also said that the Baghdad Pact is committed to strengthening its Military Committee, and "we are getting closer and closer to establishing a joint command."
    Referring to the Cyprus issue, Zorlu once again emphasized the significance of the island to Turkey. Britain and Turkey have differences on this issue.

    土耳其自掘坟墓
    同意在本国设置导弹基地
    据新华社27日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其外交部长佐鲁26日说，土耳其已经同意在它的领土上设置导弹基地。
    他在记者招待会上还表示不知道美国是否打算向其他巴格达条约国家提出类似建议。关于建立巴格达条约同北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织之间的联系的问题，据佐鲁说：“巴格达条约本身就是同其他两个组织的一种具体联系，我们已经通过交换情报的方式在北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约之间建立了各种接触。”至于同东南亚条约组织的联系问题，佐鲁说，东南亚条约组织应当主动采取行动，我们必须加以研究。
    佐鲁还说，巴格达条约在致力于加强它的军事委员会，“我们日益接近建立联合司令部”。
    谈到塞浦路斯问题时，佐鲁再次强调这个岛屿对土耳其的意义。英国和土耳其在这个问题上是有分歧的。
