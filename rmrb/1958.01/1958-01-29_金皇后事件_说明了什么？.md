What Did the "Golden Queen Incident" Show?
	Feng Jianwei

    In the recent brewing of a great leap forward in agricultural production in Shanxi Province, the Department of Agricultural Construction re-examined the "Golden Queen Incident" that once caused a sensation throughout the province, and found many useful experiences and lessons for guiding the current agricultural technology reform, and also realized some thought-provoking problems.
    The "Golden Queen Incident" occurred in 1956. At that time, rural leaders, encouraged by the upsurge of the great development of agricultural cooperatives, actively guided the expansion of the "Golden Queen" corn planting area. The province increased from 6.2 million mu (including local corn) in 1955 to 9.16 million mu, accounting for 17% of the province's grain planting area, of which about 5 million mu were "Golden Queen." The Yanbei area, where the promotion was the fastest and the largest, increased from 140,000 mu to more than 860,000 mu, nearly six times larger than in 1955. Advanced technologies such as corn close planting and artificial pollination, as well as increased labor, increased fertilizer, and more watering, were also rapidly promoted accordingly. In this way, the "Golden Queen" corn really grew vigorously and luxuriantly. Unfortunately, in the late summer and early autumn, just as the "Golden Queen" was spitting ears and flowering, heavy rains followed one after another, the sun disappeared, the climate suddenly became cold, and early frost and dry frost followed, and some corn did not spit ears or the ears did not set kernels, causing serious yield reduction losses. Since then, the saying that "Golden Queen" does not produce ears spread all over the province in an instant. Newspapers and magazines also published it, and it became more and more exaggerated and mysterious. What "600,000 mu of corn in Yanbei did not produce ears, and the corn in the Xinzhou area also had no harvest!" "A typical failure in agricultural technology reform, a painful lesson", "Agricultural leadership departments were overwhelmed by the victory of cooperation, and had a hasty mood that was divorced from reality"; complaints from some farmers and accusations from cadres poured into the offices of the agricultural leadership organs from all directions and weighed on the heads of agricultural technicians. Until the spring sowing last year, it was still circulating: "If you want to expand the 'Golden Queen', unless you steal the sky and change the sun!" to resist the expansion of corn. After this evil wind blew up, the province's corn planting area really shrank from 9.16 million mu to 6.52 million mu. Corn close planting, artificial pollination, and replacement of improved varieties were no longer promoted as before, and technical operations in many areas were simply left to the "voluntary" of farmers. Moreover, under the influence of this evil wind, some people also began to doubt the effective yield-increasing experiences of cotton close planting and expanding replanting, and a surprising phenomenon of shrinking began to appear.
    Shanxi Province has been planting "Golden Queen" since 1940 and is one of the earliest regions to promote it nationwide. Although there have been some signs of degeneration in "Golden Queen" corn in recent years, it is still a high-yielding crop loved by farmers in various places. Many new high-yield records of miscellaneous grains have been achieved on it over the years. It has also been promoted to many provinces recently. According to a survey by the Department of Agricultural Construction, taking 1956, the year with the biggest problems, as an example, the corn yield increase achievements are still very significant: This year, the average yield per mu of more than 9 million mu of corn in the province was 215 jin, the average yield per mu of millet was 134 jin, the average yield per mu of sorghum was 146 jin, and the average unit yield of miscellaneous grains was also lower than that of corn by 91 jin. The average unit yield of "Golden Queen" was not only higher than that of miscellaneous grains, but also exceeded the average yield of local corn by 30% to 40%, and in some areas with good conditions, it was more than doubled. How many acres did not produce ears or the ears did not mature? Only more than 200,000 mu, accounting for only about 2% of the province's corn planting area. This is the truth of the "Golden Queen Incident" that once stirred up the public opinion for a year.
    The facts are so clear, why did it make such a big fuss? As the main organizer and leader of this expansion of "Golden Queen" promotion, the agricultural leadership organs believe that they have shortcomings in their work methods and leadership style. That is, in leadership style, there is indeed subjectivism: in some areas of Yanbei and Xinzhou, where the climate is cold and not suitable for "Golden Queen" growth, promotion was allowed. There are also individual areas that have rigidly stipulated tasks from top to bottom, and the implementation is carried out layer by layer, lacking consultation with the masses, violating the principle of adapting to local conditions, and at the same time, technical guidance has not kept up, and post-processing is not good. Due to some reasons, the seed allocation in some areas was late, which delayed the planting period, and the preparations for technical instruction, fertilizer accumulation and transportation, and solving the ideological problems of the masses were also slow and rough, etc. Coupled with unfavorable objective factors, such as poor rainfall and climate conditions, etc., more than 200,000 mu of corn suffered serious yield reduction, which was a great loss for some townships and communities in a certain area. However, the direction of promoting high-yield crops is correct, and the yield increase achievements are also certain, and yield reduction is, after all, a very small number. The reason why people are so noisy about this matter mainly reflects the resistance of conservative ideology to the great leap forward in agricultural technology reform. In the clamor of the "Golden Queen Incident", some people insisted on some specious reasons. They said that "Golden Queen" can be planted, but it must be done slowly. Because farmers are not used to it, lack technical experience, lack fertilizer and water; others said that planting "Golden Queen" is too labor-intensive, planting too much will squeeze out millet, livestock will lack feed, and people will not like to eat it, etc. Even in bumper harvest areas, some people said: "Golden Queen" increased production and reduced life! The materials of the Yanbei corn investigation team organized by the Department of Agricultural Construction refuted these arguments. It proves that most areas of Yanbei have the conditions needed to cultivate corn and can plant a large number of medium-maturity corn varieties. "Golden Queen" can also be planted in areas with a frost-free period of more than 140 days and an altitude of less than 1,200 meters. As long as attention is paid to technology and the habit of extensive cultivation is reformed, high yields can be obtained. There are also many contrasting facts in the investigation materials: In the same type of area, some leaders actively improved natural conditions to adapt to the needs of expanding the "Golden Queen" planting area, and as a result, they obtained a large area of bumper harvest, while others complained that "Golden Queen" was not good and accommodated the backward habits of the masses, and as a result, the yield was reduced. The investigation materials concluded that as long as we persist in persuasion and education, a series of farmers' habits can be changed. All conditions that are not suitable for "Golden Queen" growth can also be improved. The key to the problem lies in leadership.
    What did the "Golden Queen Incident" show? The person in charge of the Department of Agricultural Construction said: "'The Golden Queen Incident' tells us that every success or failure case in agricultural technology reform must be analyzed comprehensively and realistically. We must not be preconceived, let alone deny everything when we find shortcomings, and in correcting deviations, we must also correct things that were originally correct.
    We have now, based on this experience, re-summarized the problems in the 1956 agricultural technology reform in the province, distinguishing between regions, crops, and technical projects. We also plan to launch a debate on the issue of promoting technical experience among the vast number of farmers, in order to educate cadres and farmers, clarify ideological understanding, and eliminate negative influences. Then, all successful technical experiences will continue to be promoted in areas where conditions permit. For those that have failed, we must find out the reasons and draw lessons to ensure that they will not be repeated. For problems that are unclear whether they are good or bad and the reasons are very complicated, we will conduct experiments in a small range and decide whether to adopt or discard them based on the results."
    The person in charge of the Department of Agricultural Construction finally said that the "Golden Queen Incident" also has positive factors, that is, it once again proved a very important truth: rashness and impetuosity are temporary and easy to correct. Conservative thinking is constant and deeply rooted, and cannot be overcome in a day or two. We must, based on this experience, always be vigilant against conservatism, and constantly break its influence and constraints through various methods and various advanced facts, and promote the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    “金皇后事件”说明了什么？
    冯建伟
    在最近山西省酝酿组织农业生产大跃进中，农业建设厅重新检查了曾经轰动全省的“金皇后事件”，从中找到很多对指导当前农业技术改革有益的经验教训，也体会到一些发人深思的问题。
    “金皇后事件”发生在1956年，那时，被农业合作化大发展高潮形势所鼓舞的农村领导干部，积极指导扩大“金皇后”玉米播种面积，全省由1955年的六百二十万亩（本地玉米在内），增加到九百一十六万亩，占全省粮食播种面积的17％，其中大约有五百万亩“金皇后”。推广最快最多的雁北地区，由十四万亩增到八十六万多亩，比1955年扩大近六倍。玉米密植、人工授粉等先进技术和增工增肥多给水等，也相应地得到迅速推广。这样，“金皇后”玉米真是长得欣欣向荣，茂盛异常。不幸，到夏末秋初，正当“金皇后”吐穗扬花之际，瓢泼大雨一场接一场，阳光不见了，气候骤然变冷了，早霜和枯霜接踵而至，一部分玉米没有吐穗或吐穗不结籽粒，造成严重减产损失。从此，“金皇后”不出穗之说，霎时传遍全省，报刊杂志也有刊载，而且越传越讹，越说越玄。什么“雁北六十万亩玉米没出穗，忻县地区玉米也没收成！”“农业技术改革上典型的失败，沉痛的教训”“农业领导部门被合作化胜利冲昏了头脑，脱离实际的急躁情绪”；部分农民们的埋怨，干部们的责备，从四面八方，涌进农业领导机关的办公室，压到农业技术干部们的头上来。直到去年春播的时候，还流传着：“要想扩大‘金皇后’，除非偷天换日头！”来抵制玉米的扩大。在这股歪风邪气刮起来以后，全省玉米播种面积真的由九百一十六万亩，缩减到六百五十二万亩了。玉米密植、人工授粉和调换良种，也不像从前那样提倡了，有许多地区的技术操作也单纯听凭农民“自愿”了。而且，在这股歪风影响下，棉花密植和扩大复播这些行之有效的增产经验，也有人提出怀疑了，也开始呈现惊人的退缩现象；
    山西省本来从1940年以后就种植“金皇后”，是全国推广比较早的地区。“金皇后”玉米近几年来虽然有一些退化现象，但仍然不失为各地农民喜爱的高产作物，历年来杂粮高产新纪录很多就出在它身上。最近还推广到许多省份，根据农业建设厅调查，以问题最大的1956年来说，玉米增产成绩仍然是很显著的：这年，全省九百多万亩玉米，平均每亩产二百一十五斤，谷子平均一百三十四斤，高粱平均每亩一百四十六斤，杂粮平均单位产量也低于玉米九十一斤，而“金皇后”的平均单位产量不仅高过杂粮，还超过本地玉米平均产量三、四成，少数条件好的高过一倍还多。不出穗的或出穗未成熟的到底有多少呢？只有二十多万亩，只占全省玉米播种面积的2％左右。这就是曾经在舆论界翻腾了一年之久的“金皇后事件”的真象。
    事实这样明白，为什么还闹得这样大？作为这次扩大推广“金皇后”的主要组织和领导者的农业领导机关，认为自己在工作方法和领导作风上都是有缺点的。那就是在领导作风上，确实有主观主义：在雁北、忻县某些地高气候冷，本来不适合“金皇后”生长的地区也准许推广了。还有个别地区自上而下硬性规定任务，层层命令执行，缺乏和群众商量，违反了因地制宜的原则，同时技术指导没有跟得上，后期加工不善。由于某种原因，有些地区种籽调拨较晚，推迟了播种期，还有技术传授、肥料积运和解决群众思想问题等准备工作也都迟缓和粗糙，等等，再加上客观方面的不利因素，如雨水气候条件太差，等等，致使二十万多亩玉米严重减产，对一个地区的某些乡社来说损失很大。但是，推广高产作物的方向是对的，增产的成绩也是肯定的，减产毕竟是极少数。人们对这件事所以那样吵闹，主要是表现了保守主义思想对大踏步地改革农业技术的抵触。在“金皇后事件”的叫嚷声中，有人坚持一些似是而非的理由，他们说“金皇后”能种，可是得慢慢来。因为农民不习惯，缺少技术经验，缺少肥料和水源；还有的说种“金皇后”太费工，种的太多会挤掉谷子，牲口会缺饲料，人吃着也不顺口等，甚至丰收地区也有人说：“金皇后”增了产，降低了生活！农业建设厅所组织的雁北玉米调查组的材料，驳倒了这些论点。证明雁北大部分地区有栽培玉米所需要的条件，可以大量种植中熟品种玉米。“金皇后”也可在无霜期一百四十天以上，海拔在一千二百公尺以下的地区种植，只要讲究技术，改革耕作粗放的习惯，是可以获得高额丰收的。调查材料中还有许多鲜明对比的事实：同类地区，有的领导农民积极改善自然条件，适应扩大“金皇后”种植面积需要，结果就获得大面积丰收，有的却埋怨“金皇后”不好，迁就群众落后习惯，结果减了产。调查材料由此得出结果说，只要坚持说服教育，农民的一系列不习惯是可以改变的。一切不适合“金皇后”生长的条件也是会改善的。问题的关键在于领导。
    “金皇后事件”说明了什么？农业建设厅负责人说：“‘金皇后事件’告诉我们，对农业技术改革上每一个成败事例，都必须全面地、实事求是的分析。千万不能先入为主，更不能发现缺点就一概否定，在纠正偏差当中，把本来是对的东西也一齐纠掉了。
    “我们现在已经根据这次经验，在全省分别地区、作物和技术项目，把1956年农业技术改革中的问题，重新作了总结。还准备在广大农民中开展一次有关推广技术经验问题的辩论，用以教育干部和农民，澄清思想认识，铲除消极影响。然后，凡是成功的技术经验，继续在条件允许的地区推广。凡是失败的，就要弄清原因，吸取教训，保证不再重犯。对好坏不清、原因又很复杂的问题，就在小范围内作试验，根据结果决定取舍”。
    农业建设厅负责人最后还说，“金皇后事件”还有积极因素，那就是再一次证明了一条很重要的真理：急躁冒进是暂时的，易于纠正的。保守思想是经常的，根深蒂固的，不是一朝一夕能够克服的。我们一定要根据这次经验，时刻警惕保守主义，并且通过各种方法，各种先进的事实，不断地打破它的影响和束缚，推动农业生产大跃进。
