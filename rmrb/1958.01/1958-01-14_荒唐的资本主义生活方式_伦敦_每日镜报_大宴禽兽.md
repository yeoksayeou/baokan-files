Absurd Capitalist Lifestyle
London "Daily Mirror" Hosts a Feast for Beasts

In a magnificent "Royal Cafe" in central London, a banquet unprecedented in the world was held not long ago. The "guests" attending the banquet were all kinds of birds and beasts such as dogs, cats, horses, monkeys, and parrots. Even a large snake was a guest at this banquet. A darling of London, a gorilla named "Congo," attended the banquet accompanied by a certain doctor. This gorilla had previously made a splash for scribbling on canvases with its paws, and its "paintings" were even exhibited at the zoo. A young pony from a military camp wagged its tail and came to the banquet. A parrot famous for participating in "musical" performances was a distinguished guest at this banquet. Two French cats strode proudly from a millionaire's luxurious car to attend the banquet, famous for being the pets of the Duke of Bedford. Finally, a group of puppies jumped out of sparkling cars. They were wearing the most fashionable and brightly colored sweaters of the contemporary dog world, holding golden invitations in their mouths, and hurried to push open the glass door of the restaurant and rush to the table. They had been winners in "beauty contests" and "ice skating contests."

All kinds of beast "guests" sat in the best seats, with waiters bowing and standing in front of them, serving them food.

This strange beast banquet was held by the London newspaper "Daily Mirror" for the entertainment of wealthy readers. Nennel, the editor of the newspaper, was the host of the banquet. He actually gave a long speech at the banquet, calling out "Ladies and gentlemen," and said that he was the representative of the "Daily Mirror's" millions of kind and great-hearted readers. Their great-heartedness was entirely dedicated to four-legged animals.

Before he finished speaking, the beasts had already launched a battle for food on the table. Fierce dogs grabbed meat bones, French cats scurried around the tables, and parrots' mouths were full of chicken. When it heard the words "Daily Mirror," according to a pre-arranged plan, it mumbled a sentence. At first, no one understood it. Finally, after it scratched its mouth with its paws and repeated that sentence, everyone understood. It turned out to be: "Read the 'Daily Mirror'."

The banquet ended like this. Later, the "Daily Mirror" published news and photos of the banquet in a full two-page spread. (Xinhua News Agency)

    荒唐的资本主义生活方式
    伦敦“每日镜报”大宴禽兽
    在伦敦中央大街一座华丽的“皇家咖啡馆”里，不久前举行了一次世界上空前的宴会，出席宴会的“客人”全部是狗、猫、马、猴、鹦鹉等飞禽走兽，甚至大蛇也是这个宴会的座上客。伦敦的尤物，一只名叫“刚果”的猩猩在某一个博士的伴随下参加了宴会。这只猩猩曾经因为用脚爪在画布上乱画而出过风头，它的“画”还在动物园的展览会上展览过。一个军营的小马驹摇晃着尾巴来参加宴会。曾经因为参加过“音乐”演出而著名的一只鹦鹉是这个宴会的高贵客人。两只法国猫昂首阔步地从一辆百万富翁的华丽小轿车上走下来参加宴会，它们因为是贝德福公爵的宠物而享有盛名。最后，一群小狗从闪闪发光的小轿车上跳下来，它们身穿当代狗世界最摩登的、颜色最鲜艳的羊毛衫，嘴里衔着金色请帖，急急忙忙推开饭店的玻璃门，奔向餐桌，它们曾经是“美丽竞赛”和“滑冰竞赛”中的优胜者。
    各种各样的野兽“客人”们坐在最好的座位上，侍者躬身站在它们的面前，服侍它们吃饭。
    这个奇怪的野兽宴会是伦敦的报纸“每日镜报”为有钱的读者消遣而举办的。这家报纸的主编嫩纳尔是宴会的主人。他居然在宴会上发表了长篇的讲话，叫着“女士们，绅士们”，并且说什么他是“每日镜报”千百万善良而具有伟大心肠的读者的代表。他们的这种伟大心肠完全是献给四脚动物的。
    话犹未了，野兽们在席面上早就展开了争夺战。猛犬抢吃肉骨头，法国猫在各桌上到处奔窜，鹦鹉满嘴都是鸡肉，当它听到“每日镜报”几个字的时候，根据早就准备好的计划，它含糊地说了一句话。起初大家谁也没有听懂，最后，当它用脚爪在嘴上抓了一下，又重复了它那句话以后，大家才听清楚。原来是：“请读‘每日镜报’。”
    宴会就这样结束了。后来，“每日镜报”以整整两版的篇幅登载了这个宴会的消息和照片。　（据新华社）
