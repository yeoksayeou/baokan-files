Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th. The Soviet Academy of Sciences Publishing House has recently published the full text of the autobiography, memoirs, and personal diaries of the famous British biologist Charles Darwin. This is the first time in the world that the full texts of these works have been published; previously, only abridged versions were available.

The newly published book includes many important materials, which are sufficient to demonstrate Darwin's worldview and his relationship with his contemporaries. Darwin's description of his views on religion in his memoirs is very significant. According to the earliest published abridged versions, Darwin was generally considered an agnostic. However, based on the full text of the memoirs now available, it can be definitively said that Darwin was essentially a true atheist. The publication of Darwin's complete diaries makes it possible to more accurately determine the dates of Darwin's life and creative activities.

When preparing to publish these works, the Soviet Academy of Sciences Publishing House requested the Cambridge University Library in England to send copies of the full text of Darwin's memoirs, manuscripts, and notes to Moscow. The university agreed to this request and sent photographs of the works.

    苏联出版达尔文自传和日记
    证明达尔文是真正的无神论者
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联科学院出版局最近出版了著名的英国生物学家达尔文的自传、回忆录和个人日记的全文。这是世界上第一次出版这些著作的全文，过去只出版过删节本。
    新出版的这本书籍包括了许多重要的材料，它足可以表现出达尔文的宇宙观和他与同时代人的关系等。回忆录中达尔文叙述自己对宗教的看法的部分是很有意义的。根据最早出版的删节本，达尔文一般地被认为是不可知论者。而现在根据回忆录的全文可以肯定地说，达尔文实质上是真正的无神论者。达尔文全部日记的出版使有可能更精确的弄清楚达尔文的生活和创作活动的日期。
    苏联科学院出版局在准备出版这些著作时，曾经请求英国剑桥大学图书馆把达尔文的回忆录、手稿、笔记全文的复本寄到莫斯科，这个大学答应了这一请求，寄来了著作的照片。
