Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to news compiled by our paper: In Western Europe, the movement against the establishment of US rocket bases in their countries by the public and public opinion is rising vigorously. The West German public also continues to demand the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

The French National Peace Council convened a meeting in Paris from January 11th to 13th. The meeting decided to launch a widespread public signature campaign against the establishment of rocket launch pads on French territory.

The Peace Council called on the French people to express their opposition to the establishment of rocket launch pads on French territory through signatures, and demanded that the French government initiate negotiations between NATO countries and Warsaw Pact countries as a first step towards disarmament and easing the situation.

During the meeting, many speakers emphasized the importance of initiating a public signature campaign against the storage of atomic weapons and the establishment of rocket launch pads in France. Among the speakers were prominent French peace fighters, winners of the "Strengthening International Peace" Lenin International Prize, D'Astier de la Vigerie, Madame Faure, Madame Eugénie Cotton, Laurent Casanova, and Jacques Madaule.

The "German League" held a mass rally in Hanover. Participants in the rally protested against the West German government's arming of the West German army with atomic weapons. They demanded that the West German authorities refuse to establish American atomic rocket bases in West Germany.

On January 13th, a West German Social Democratic Party leader expressed "great regret" over Eisenhower's refusal in his reply to Bulganin regarding the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

Prominent West German atomic scientist Strassmann expressed firm protest against the West German authorities' practice of turning West Germany into a "nuclear weapons warehouse."

The Hamburg newspaper "Die Welt" published an editorial on January 13th, arguing that Western countries should consider Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe without prejudice.

Two Labour Party MPs from the Scottish region of the UK, Malcolm K. MacMillan and John Rankin, wrote to British Prime Minister Macmillan, expressing serious concern about the US plan to establish rocket bases in Scotland, demanding that the British government ensure that the UK has full sovereignty and can supervise the use of nuclear weapons within its territory, and expressing the hope that all nuclear weapons stockpiles can be destroyed in the future.

Representatives of the Western Federation of Trade Unions Council in the UK (including all major cities in the West of England) expressed their opposition to American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs flying over British airspace at a meeting in Bristol on January 8th, and called on the government to halt nuclear weapons testing as a first step towards banning nuclear weapons.

American Air Force General Brooke Allen's speech at a banquet held by the Foreign Press Association in Athens on January 11th, advocating the establishment of missile bases in Greece, aroused protests from many Greek newspapers. The "New Struggle" newspaper in Karditsa emphasized that if atomic bases were built in Greece, once war breaks out, our country would be turned into ruins for the sake of "Dulles' strategy." Greece has the right and should hold its head high and answer "No!" to Dulles' plan.
