On "Being Serious"
	Bai Fu

Chairman Mao, when meeting with students studying in the Soviet Union, said this: "In the world, what people fear most is 'being serious'; the Communist Party is the one that emphasizes 'being serious' the most." The two words "being serious" are very common and frequently used words for us, but their meaning is indeed extremely profound.

The Communist Party is most serious in its work. It always does what it says. It says things clearly and acts decisively. It speaks without ambiguity and acts without carelessness. This serious style demonstrates the thoroughness and resoluteness of the revolution and the spirit of never giving up until the goal is achieved. It is a precious characteristic of a revolutionary party and revolutionary partisans.

In the old society, we often heard maxims advising people not to be too serious, such as "Give others convenience, and you give yourself convenience," "Open one eye and close the other," "Turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems," "Let it go when it should be let go, and release it when it should be released," etc. Their meaning was nothing more than advising people to adopt a perfunctory attitude towards things and a compromising and conciliatory attitude towards disputes between people. Today, if we use this kind of perfunctory, compromising, and conciliatory attitude to treat the revolution, the revolution will suffer losses; if we use it to treat the people's cause, the people will be harmed. Therefore, we must reject this attitude and replace it with a serious attitude.

Rightist elements are very afraid of us being serious. Once we become serious, rightist elements will have nowhere to hide, and they will not be able to muddle through. Because we are determined to dig out every single rightist element and refute every single fallacy until it is completely refuted. They are afraid of us being serious, and we just happen to be the ones who emphasize "being serious" the most.

We are still most serious about rectification. Saying to let people speak out freely means truly letting them speak out freely; saying to rectify the work style means truly rectifying it. Only in this way can we overturn some bad ideas, improve our thinking, and advance the revolutionary cause. Currently, some units are organizing the masses to conduct a review after the rectification, which further demonstrates the spirit of serious rectification, that is, individual perfunctory rectification projects are not allowed to be easily let go.

Not being serious only benefits those who want to muddle through. Clearly, the speaking out is not deep or thorough, but he can claim that it has already been deep and thorough. Clearly, there has been no improvement, but he can lie that the improvement has been great. This is of course a very bad thing. However, at present, serious work has become a social trend, and the number of people who emphasize "being serious" is increasing day by day. In that case, those who do not emphasize "being serious" will not only encounter superiors who emphasize "being serious," but also masses who emphasize "being serious." This will make it impossible for him to muddle through, and he will be unable to stop even if he wants to. In the end, he will have to seriously rectify his own lack of seriousness.

In fact, if you do everything seriously, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. In the rectification, if the leaders seriously set themselves on fire, the masses will not fail to speak out freely; if the leaders seriously follow the mass line, there is no need to worry that difficult tasks will not be quickly improved. Nothing is difficult in the world; it just requires serious work.

Not only is this the case for rectification, but by extension, we must take a serious attitude towards everything we do. Saying to exercise means to exercise seriously, saying to eliminate the four pests means to eliminate them seriously, saying to improve agricultural production technology means to improve it seriously. In a word, we must treat any revolutionary work seriously and solemnly, and never deal with it carelessly or perfunctorily. This is the concrete manifestation of our vigorous and flourishing revolutionary drive.

### 谈“认真”

    谈“认真”
    白夫
    毛主席在会见留苏学生时，曾说过这样一句话：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”“认真”这两个字，对于我们，本是十分普通、常用的字，但它的意义确实极为深远的。
    共产党办事最认真，凡事说到做到，说得明白，做得坚决，说得不含糊其词，做得不马虎从事。这种认真的作风，表明了革命的彻底性、坚决性，表明了不达目的决不罢休的精神。它是革命政党和革命党人可贵的特征。
    在旧社会，我们常听到一些劝人莫认真的格言，所谓“予人方便，予己方便”啦，“睁着一只眼，闭着一只眼”啦，“大事化小，小事化无”啦，“得罢休时且罢休，须放手来且放手”啦，等等，其意总不外劝人对事要采敷衍应付的态度，对于人和人之间的争执要采取妥协调和的态度。今天我们如以此种敷衍应付、妥协调和的态度来对待革命，则革命受损失；来对待人民事业，则人民受其害。因此我们必须排斥这种态度，而代之以认真的态度。
    右派分子很怕我们认真。我们一认真起来，右派分子便无藏身之所，也休想蒙混过关。因为我们是务必做到一个个右派分子被挖掘出来，一条条谬论被驳得体无完肤而后已。他们怕我们认真，而我们恰恰就最讲“认真”二字。
    对待整改，我们也还是最讲“认真”二字。说大鸣大放，就是真鸣真放；说整改作风，就是真整真改。只有这样，才能反掉几个坏的主义，才能提高思想，把革命事业推向前进。目前有的单位，在整改以后还要组织群众来进行复查，这更加表现了认真整改的精神，即对个别马虎从事的整改项目，也不允许轻轻放过。
    不认真，只会对蒙混过关者有利。明明鸣放不深不透，他可以扬言已经深透了，明明没有改进，他可以谎称改进很大了。这当然是很不好的事。不过，目前认真办事已成为社会风气，讲“认真”的人已经一天天增多起来。那么，不讲“认真”的人，不只会遇到讲“认真”的上级，而且还会遇到讲“认真”的群众。这样便会使他想混而过不去，欲罢而势不能。到头来还得认真地整一整自己的不认真。
    其实，凡事认真去做，也没有克服不了的困难。在整改当中，领导人认真地引火烧身了，群众不会鸣放不起来；领导人认真地走群众路线，烦难的工作不愁不迅速改进。世上无难事，只是要认真地干。
    不只对于整改如此，推而广之，我们对待一切的事情，都须持取认真的态度。说锻炼就认真锻炼，说除四害就认真去除，说改进农业生产技术就认真改进，一句话，对待任何革命工作，都是认真的、严肃的，绝不草率应付、苟且从事。这也就是我们蓬勃旺盛的革命干劲的具体表现。
