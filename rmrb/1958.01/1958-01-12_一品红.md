    Poinsettia

    In the severe winter, people need to appreciate flowers to ease their mood! The poinsettia seems to understand people's thoughts, unfolding its rich, beautiful flowers and leaves, standing tall before you. The fresh green leaves look like a violin, with a group of peach-shaped green flowers (with red tips) blooming on the branches. At the tips of the flowers is a yellow nectar gland shaped like a goldfish's mouth, and below the flowers, a circle of bright red leaves provides a backdrop. What is pleasing is not only its charming appearance, but also its long flowering period, which can last from December of one year to February of the next.

    The poinsettia's hometown is Mexico in Central America, which has a tropical climate. After it came to our country, it can still be planted in the wild in Guangdong; but when it comes to North China, the climate is colder, and it cannot overwinter outdoors, so it must be moved into a greenhouse in winter.

    Spring is the season for pruning and cutting poinsettias. When pruning, leave three or four side branches on the old stems, and two or three new branches on each side branch. By winter, there can be six or seven branches blooming. The pruned branches can be cut into three or four inches long, inserted in sandy soil, and placed in a shady, humid, and warm place. They will root in about a month and can bloom one flower that year. Fertilize every ten days to half a month (fermented sesame paste residue, bean cake water, or human manure diluted with water) to make the old and newly inserted branches grow vigorously. If you want them to bloom earlier, you can move them into a greenhouse (15-30 degrees Celsius) at the end of September and give them strong sunlight, and they can bloom in November. After flowering, move them to a more shaded and cool (temperature maintained at 5-10 degrees) place to prolong the flowering time.

    Poinsettias can not only be used as potted plants for people to appreciate, but their flowers can also be used as various decorative flowers. Whether you insert them in a vase, tie them into a bouquet, or make a flower basket, matching them with poinsettias will make them look particularly fresh and pleasing to the eye. If you match a small bouquet of poinsettias with a few white and yellow chrysanthemums, making a beautiful corsage and hanging it on the chest of combat heroes and model workers, it will appear even more meaningful.

    一品红
    在严寒的冬季，人们是多么需要观赏花卉以舒畅心情啊！一品红就像猜透了人们的心思，展开了她那丰艳娇洁的花和叶，挺立在你的面前。那鲜绿的叶子好像一只小提琴，枝顶上开着一群桃形的绿色小花（花尖呈红色），花尖上有一个像金鱼嘴状的黄色蜜腺，花的下边，衬托着一轮鲜红色的叶子。逗人喜爱的，不仅在于她那娇艳的姿态，而且她的花期很长，可以从头年的12月开到次年的2月。
    一品红的故乡是中美墨西哥，那里是热带气候。她来到我们国家后，在广东一带的野地里还可以栽植；但来到华北，气候较冷，她就不能在野外过冬了，冬天必须把她搬进温室。
    春天，是给一品红剪枝和插枝的季节。剪枝时，老干上留三、四个侧枝，每侧枝再留二、三新枝。到了冬天就可以有六、七个枝条开花。剪下来的枝条，再截成三、四寸长，插在砂土里，放在阴湿温暖的地方，大约一个月左右就能生根，当年也能开一枝花。每隔十天到半月浇一次肥（经水泡后发酵了的麻酱渣、豆饼水或人粪尿），可以使老枝和新插的枝长得旺盛。如果想让她早一点开花，在9月底就可搬进温室（摄氏十五—三十度），并给她强烈的日光，11月就可以开花。开花后搬到较荫蔽而又凉爽（温度保持在五—十度）的地方，可以延长开花时间。
    一品红不但可以作盆景供人观赏，她的花还可以作各种饰花。无论你插瓶、扎花束，或者作花篮，配上一品红，会显得分外清新爽目。假若在一小束一品红中，镶配上几朵白色、黄色的菊花，作成一朵美丽的襟花，挂在战斗英雄、劳动模范的胸前，那更显得意义深远了。
