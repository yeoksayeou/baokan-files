Mountain Area Transportation Should Rely on the Masses
Jing Yu
Amidst the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward, developing mountain area transportation, changing the face of mountain areas, increasing industrial and agricultural production, and improving the lives of people in mountain areas is also a very important task at present.

China's mountain areas are extremely rich in resources. Due to rugged roads and traffic congestion, mountain area specialties cannot be transported out, resulting in very low prices; while imported daily necessities are particularly expensive. This situation is detrimental to the development of mountain area production and the improvement of people's lives. For example, the Qinling Mountains area has a mild climate and abundant rainfall. The forest area is vast, with all kinds of trees – timber forests, economic forests, and fruit tree forests. Valuable medicinal materials and rare metals are also abundant. However, due to inconvenient transportation, the people's lives cannot be rapidly improved. According to a survey by the Ministry of Communications: Farmers in Zhaochuan District, Shanyang County, Shangluo Special Zone in the Qinling Mountains need eighteen eggs to exchange for one jin of salt, and twenty jin of corn to exchange for one jin of kerosene. The masses generally have to travel about a hundred li to deliver public grain, carrying it on their shoulders and backs, which is extremely difficult. It can be seen that developing mountain area transportation is an urgent and important issue in building mountain areas.

How to develop mountain area transportation? There are only two ways: one is to rely on state investment and wait for the state to undertake it; the other is to mobilize the masses and rely on the people's manpower and financial resources to do it. According to the former method, the result is often that a lot of money is spent, progress is slow, and it cannot immediately meet the needs. According to statistics, by the end of 1957, there were still one hundred and ten mountain counties in the country, excluding Tibet, that were not accessible by road, and the construction work was very difficult. To build these roads well, the state needs to spend a great deal of effort and time. If the transportation within the county also needs to be handled by the state, it will inevitably be delayed, because the state needs to handle many things, and the construction funds are limited, and it is impossible to blossom everywhere. According to the latter method, the result will definitely be that less money is spent, more things are done, progress is fast, and the effect is good. The news about Ji County in Hebei Province relying on the masses to do a good job in road transportation, published on the front page of this newspaper today, is a powerful proof. Before liberation, the entire territory of Ji County had only one hundred and five kilometers of roads, and they were also bumpy and uneven. After liberation, relying on the strength of the masses, the county's roads increased to three hundred and ninety-one kilometers, achieving road access to every township. This shows that the potential of the masses is enormous. As long as we establish the idea of relying on the masses, things that the state could not do for a while can be done by the masses more, faster, better, and more economically.

Ji County's experience is worth popularizing. What Ji County can do, other places are also fully capable of doing.

    山区交通要靠群众办
    静宇
    在大跃进声浪中，发展山区交通，改变山区面貌、提高工农业生产、改善山区人民生活，也是当前的一项十分重要工作。
    我国山区资源极为丰富，由于道路崎岖，交通阻塞，山区的土特产无法外运，以致价格很低；而外来的日用品又特别昂贵。这种情况，对发展山区生产，改善山区人民生活都是不利的。像秦岭山区气候温和，雨量充沛，林区面积很大，各种林木——用材林、经济林、果树林应有尽有，贵重药材和稀有金属也很多，只因为交通不便，人民生活不能迅速地改善。据交通部调查：秦岭山区商?专区山阳县照川区农民用十八个鸡子才能换到一斤盐，用二十斤玉米才能换到一斤煤油。群众送公粮一般都要走百里左右，肩挑背负，极为艰难。可见发展山区交通，是建设山区的一项迫切而重要的问题。
    怎样发展山区交通？办法不外两个：一个是靠国家投资，等国家来兴办；一个是发动群众、依靠群众的人力和财力来举办。按照前一个办法，其结果往往是花钱很多，进展较慢，不能马上适应需要。据统计，到1957年止，全国除西藏而外，尚有一百一十个山区县城不通公路，修建工程十分艰巨。要修好这些公路，需要国家花很大的力量和时间，如果县境以内的交通也要国家来举办，势必拖延时日，因为国家需要举办的事情很多，而建设资金是有限的，不可能处处开花。按照后一个办法，其结果一定可以花钱很少，办事很多，进展很快，效果很好。今天本报第一版刊登的河北蓟县依靠群众办好公路交通的消息，就是有力的证明，解放以前蓟县全境公路只有一百零五公里，而且坎坷不平。解放以后依靠群众的力量，使全县公路增加到三百九十一公里，做到乡乡大路相通，这说明群众的潜力是巨大的，只要树立依靠群众的思想，原来国家一时办不到的事情，而群众办起来反而又多又快又好又省。
    蓟县的经验值得推而广之。蓟县能办到的事情，各地也完全有可能办到。
