Frontline of Eliminating the Four Pests

    More than 500,000 rats and sparrows eliminated
    Eight cities and sixty-seven counties in Anhui Province have successively launched patriotic health campaigns. According to incomplete statistics from forty-nine cities and counties, from November 1 to December 6 of last year, 23,804 jin of flies, maggots, and pupae and more than 1,930,000 matchboxes were destroyed, 130,607 rats were caught, and 451,029 sparrows were killed. Tens of thousands of workers, farmers, urban residents, students, and cadres joined this battle. Throughout the province, Bengbu City, Fuyang Special District, and Bengbu Special District have done a better job. The health propaganda work in Bengbu City has been carried out more thoroughly, greatly inspiring the masses. After the publicity, eight units, including the Normal School, the Fifth Middle School, and the East District Commercial Brigade in the city, submitted letters of guarantee and determination to the city's party and government leaders. Other units have also launched enthusiastic challenge activities. Many units, while not affecting their work and adhering to the principle of first eliminating the "four pests" internally, have also organized forces to help other units carry out health campaigns in batches.
    Not a single grain of rice for the rats
    Since October last year, Fuzhou City has extensively and deeply carried out a winter rat-catching and grain-protection campaign. The social health workers in the Taijiang District set up rat traps everywhere day and night and dug rat holes, destroying more than 190,000 rats in one month. Medical workers and Red Cross members in the Cangshan District arranged various rat-catching tools from house to house, resulting in the capture of 100,000 rats. The Yuanyang Elementary School in the suburbs used extracurricular activities and Sundays to combine gleaning rice ears in the fields with dividing areas to dig out rat holes, killing more than 21,000 rats. Hengyu Agricultural Cooperative also put forward the slogan of not letting rats eat a single grain of rice. The members of the cooperative combined autumn harvesting with hoes and brooms to go to the fields to dig rat holes, and comprehensively turned over haystacks, catching more than 17,000 rats. At present, various places are selecting rat-catching activists to exchange experiences and carry out the rat-catching campaign more widely and deeply. (Lian Jingqing)
    Glorious achievements of the rat-catching campaign in Changchun
    Changchun City: Inspired by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the people of Changchun have caught a total of 500,000 rats in the past two months, which is four times the number caught from January to October 1957.
    Before achieving this achievement, the people of Changchun City had done a lot of work. The Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Station investigated the density and distribution of rats in the city, studied the rat-killing experiences and tools created by the masses, compiled and printed various propaganda materials, trained more than 1,200 poison applicators, and summarized the rat-catching experience of rat-free streets to educate the masses, thus dispelling the idea that "rats cannot be completely eliminated." The Erdaohuzi District caught more than 40,000 rats in one month. The cleaning team of this district caught more than 5,000 rats, an average of eighty-two rats per person. After discussing the National Agricultural Development Program, farmers in the suburbs caught more than 300,000 rats. (Xinhua News Agency Special)
    Lu Yin, an activist in eliminating the four pests
    In Dongshan Village, Pinghe County, Fujian Province, there is an old man named Lu Yin, who is an activist in eliminating the four pests. As early as February 1956, he actively salvaged mosquito larvae, collecting more than 1,200 jin of larvae, and was named a model for eliminating the four pests in the county. Later, he used the money from selling poultry to buy more than eighty rat traps and actively carried out rat-catching work. Every evening, he carried rat traps to various villages and placed them from house to house. He went back to collect them at dawn the next day, and he persisted in doing so regardless of wind or rain. He is also good at analyzing the life and activity patterns of rats in different seasons. Every time he goes to a village to set traps, he first explores the local rat activity, so he catches a lot of rats. Every time the rat traps are used, he washes them with boiling water, bakes them over a fire, or exposes them to the sun to eliminate the smell of dead rats and improve the efficiency of luring rats with bait. He also pays attention to publicity to encourage more people to take action. By the end of October last year, he had eliminated a total of 213 sparrows, 2,777 rats, and salvaged 1,138 jin of mosquito larvae, and once again won the honorary title of first-class activist in health and pest elimination in the county.

    除四害前线
    消灭鼠雀五十多万只
    安徽省已有八个市和六十七个县先后开展了爱国卫生运动。据四十九个市、县的不完全统计，自去年11月1日到12月6日消灭蝇、蛆、蛹二万三千八百零四斤又一百九十三万多火柴盒，捕鼠十三万零六百零七只，打麻雀四十五万一千零二十九只。成千上万的工人、农民、城市居民以及学生、干部投入了这一战斗。全省范围内以蚌埠市、阜阳专区、蚌埠专区开展得较好，蚌埠市的卫生宣传工作做得比较深入，对群众鼓舞很大。经过宣传，该市以师范学校、第五中学、东区商业大队等八个单位，向市区党政首长递了保证书和决心书。其他各单位也都掀起了热烈的挑应战活动。许多单位在不影响工作和首先消灭内部“四害”的原则下，还组织力量，分批到别的单位帮助开展卫生运动。
    不让老鼠吃一颗稻粒
    去年10月起，福州市广泛深入地开展了冬季捕鼠保粮运动。台江区社会卫生工作，不分昼夜地到处布放捕鼠夹，挖鼠洞，一个月就捕灭了十九万多只老鼠。仓山区医务工作者和红十字会会员，挨家挨户地布置各种捕鼠工具，结果捉到了十万只老鼠。郊区远洋小学，利用课外活动时间和星期日，结合下田拾稻穗，分片围掘鼠洞，捕杀了两万一千多只老鼠。横屿农业社还提出不让老鼠吃掉一颗稻粒的口号，社员们结合秋收带着锄头、扫帚下地，挖掘鼠洞，并且全面进行翻草堆，捕到老鼠一万七千多只。目前各地正在评选捕鼠积极分子，以便交流经验，更加广泛深入地开展捕鼠运动。　（练敬情）
    长春人民捕鼠战果辉煌
    长春市　人民在全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的鼓舞下，近两个月内共捕鼠五十万只，等于1957年1到10月捕鼠的四倍。
    长春市人民在取得这个成绩之前，曾经做了许多工作。市卫生防疫站调查了全市鼠的密度和分布情况，研究了群众创造的打鼠经验和捕打工具，编印了各种宣传材料，还训练了一千二百多名投药员，总结了无鼠街的捕鼠经验教育群众，这样就解除了有人认为“耗子打不净”的思想。二道河子区在一个月的时间里就捕鼠四万多只。这个区的清洁队捕鼠五千多只，平均每人捕捉老鼠八十二只。郊区农民在讨论了全国农业发展纲要以后，共捕鼠三十余万只。　（新华社专稿）
    除四害积极分子卢饮
    福建省平和县东山村有一个名叫卢饮的老人，他是除四害的积极分子。早在1956年2月他就积极打捞孑孓，共捞了一千二百多斤孑孓，被评为全县的除四害模范。以后，他又把卖家禽换得的钱买了八十多个鼠夹，积极地开展捕鼠工作。每天黄昏，他挑着鼠夹到各个村庄，挨家逐户布放。翌日天刚曚亮就去收回，不论刮风下雨他都这样地坚持下去。他还善于分析老鼠在不同季节的生活和活动规律。每到一个村庄布放的时候，都要先摸索当地老鼠出没活动情况，因此他抓了很多老鼠。每次鼠夹用了以后，他都用开水洗净，经过火烤或放在阳光下曝晒，以消除死鼠沾染味道，提高诱鼠上饵的效率。他还注意宣传工作，以引起更多的人动手起来。到去年10月底，他一共消灭了麻雀二百十三只、老鼠二千七百七十七只、捞孑孓一千一百三十八斤，再次荣获县卫生除害一等积极分子的光荣称号。　（留汉凡）
