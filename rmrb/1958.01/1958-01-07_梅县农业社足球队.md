    Meixian Agricultural Cooperative Football Team
    Guangdong Province's Meixian held the 1957 county-wide agricultural cooperative football championship in late December last year. Twelve representative teams selected from agricultural cooperatives in twenty-five townships participated in the competition, totaling one hundred and eighty outstanding farmer football players. After seven days and twenty-one matches, the Chengbei Township and Bingcun Township teams won the championship and runner-up titles, respectively. Through this competition, Meixian selected twenty-two athletes to form the 1958 county-wide agricultural cooperative football team.
    Many agricultural cooperative members in Meixian consider football a vital cultural activity. Currently, every agricultural cooperative in the county has at least one organized football team, and this is even more common in primary and secondary schools. Therefore, the county has one thousand two hundred and eighty football teams, with more than ten thousand athletes. In 1957, nearly six hundred teams with over six thousand players participated in various football championships. The Meixian football team, composed of outstanding athletes from across the county, won the championship in the Wuhan Division of the 1955 National Football Zonal Tournament and the runner-up title in the Guangdong Province Football Championship. This team has now been approved by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission as a Class B team.

    梅县农业社足球队
    广东省梅县在去年12月下旬举行了1957年全县农业社足球锦标比赛。参加比赛的有从二十五个乡的农业社中选拔出来的十二个代表队，共一百八十名优秀的农民足球运动员。经过七天二十一场比赛后，由城北乡、丙村乡两个代表队分别获得冠、亚军。通过这次比赛，梅县选出了二十二名运动员，组成了1958年全县农业社足球代表队。
    梅县许多农业社社员，把足球运动当作一项不可缺少的文化活动。目前，全县每一个农业社都至少有一个有组织的足球队，中小学校则更为普遍。因此，全县有足球队一千二百八十个，运动员一万多人。在1957年一年间，参加过各种类足球锦标赛的球队近六百个，队员六千多人。集中全县优秀运动员组成的梅县足球队，曾取得1955年全国足球分区赛武汉区冠军和广东省足球亚军。现在这个队已被国家体委批准为乙级球队。
