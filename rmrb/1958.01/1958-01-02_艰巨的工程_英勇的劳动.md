    A report from our correspondent, Li Qian, regarding the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway: The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is one of the key new railway trunk lines built during China's First Five-Year Plan. It starts in Baoji, Shaanxi Province, connecting with the Longhai Railway in the north, passes through the southeastern corner of Gansu Province, and reaches Chengdu in Sichuan Province, connecting with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Chengdu-Kunming Railway and Sichuan-Guizhou Railway which are under construction. This railway will connect the southwestern region of China with the northwest, north China, and other regions of the country.

    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway runs through an area characterized by overlapping mountains, steep ridges and deep valleys, and crisscrossing rivers. Of the entire 668-kilometer line, over 530 kilometers pass through mountainous regions. Not far from Baoji, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is blocked by the imposing Qinling Mountains. From Yangjiawan to the southern entrance of the Qinling Tunnel, the straight-line distance is only 12 kilometers, but the altitude difference is as much as 600 meters. In order to pass through the Qinling Mountains, the line must be extended to reduce the slope; therefore, this section of the railway winds along the Qingjiang River valley, circling through the mountains of the Qinling Mountains, rising step by step, overlapping five layers, and twisting left and right into three horseshoe shapes and an "8" shape. South of the Qinling Mountains, the line runs along the Jialing River to Guangyuan in Sichuan. This section of the road winds through the high mountains and ridges of the Qinling and Daba Mountains. Except for a few terraces, most of it is cliffs and precipices, overlooking the rapids. It crosses the Jialing River sixteen times. Especially the Lingguan Gorge, known as a natural barrier, is even more characterized by towering cliffs and turbulent rivers. People call the bend of the Jialing River in the gorge the "human boiling pot" and the "mass grave." After passing Guangyuan and going through the Jianmen Mountain area, you reach the western Sichuan Plain. This section of the road is only 11.8 kilometers long. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is not only located in a dangerous terrain, but also has a very complex geological situation. Most of the mountainous areas are in the 6th and 7th degree earthquake zones, and some areas in the northern section are ancient glacial areas. In these places, the rock weathering is serious, there are many cracks, and there are many accumulation layers, coupled with particularly abundant groundwater, which easily forms various subgrade diseases such as collapses, landslides, debris flows, and mudflows. These natural conditions have created the complexity and arduousness of the project.

    Inspired by the lofty ideal of building socialism, more than 100,000 railway construction workers, with a spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, tried every means to bravely fight against the fierce mountains and bad waters. In more than four years, they have hollowed out countless mountains and leveled countless peaks. It is a very common thing for these heroic railway construction workers to make high mountains bow their heads and make rivers give way. When the railway was built near Guanyin Mountain, four hills blocked the way. With the help of Soviet experts, the railway construction workers used explosives equivalent to five train cars to cut off four hills at once, blasting 200,000 cubic meters of rock. The workers used this flat area to lay railway tracks and build a station. This blasting shortened the construction period by five months and reduced costs by 76,000 yuan. The Qing Shiya station, known as the Yunxiao station, still had cliffs and deep valleys blocking the way three years ago. In order to overcome this high mountain, workers always climbed the cliffs, pulling on ropes, whether on cold and windy nights or during snowy days. Since there was no place to stand on the cliff, they tied ropes to themselves, suspended in mid-air, to dig pilot holes for blasting. Then, they put 340 tons of explosives into the dug holes, blasting away a peak equivalent to a fifteen-story building, filling in the deep valley, and building this station.

    During the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the railway construction workers drilled through 304 mountains and built tunnels. More than 990 bridges were built along the line. In addition, in order to prevent collapses, landslides and other diseases, many retaining walls, culverts, support walls, seepage blind ditches and other projects were also built.

    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, like a well-equipped railway university, has trained tens of thousands of technical cadres and workers for the country during the construction process. In addition to a few original railway employees, the vast majority of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway builders were farmers and urban poor people, and some were demobilized soldiers and veterans from the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. When they first arrived on the site, some people had never even seen a tunnel, but now they have become skilled tunnel workers; some workers from rural areas were afraid of the sound of small-scale blasting at the beginning, but now they have become skilled workers who have mastered large-scale blasting technology; and many temporary workers have learned various technologies such as mountain opening and grouting. They have not only initially mastered the technology, but also tried every means to rapidly improve their technical level and work efficiency in order to build this road to happiness as soon as possible. For example, when workers of the Sixth Engineering Bureau started building tunnels, they could only complete 20 to 30 meters per month, but by 1956 they had reached 100 meters. The improvement of engineering and technical personnel in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was also very rapid. Many students who had just graduated from school at the beginning of construction have become engineers after several years of training; the original senior engineers have also become more experienced through these years of training. Many technical problems that engineers could not solve in the past can now be solved by general technical workers. With such a strong and brave construction team and such rich experience, what kind of difficult road construction projects can stop us in the future?

    艰巨的工程　英勇的劳动
    本报讯　记者李茜介绍宝成铁路修建情况：宝成铁路是我国第一个五年计划期间新建的重要铁路干线之一，北起陕西省的宝鸡和陇海路相接，经过甘肃省的东南角，到达四川省的成都和成渝铁路以及正在建设的成昆铁路、川黔铁路相连。通过这条铁路，我国的西南地区和西北、华北以及全国其他地区就可以连接起来。
    宝成铁路沿线多是山峦重叠、岭陡沟深、河流纵横交错的地区。在全线六百六十八公里中，有五百三十多公里都经过山岳地区。出宝鸡不远，宝成铁路便被险峻的秦岭拦住，从杨家湾至秦岭隧道南口，直线距离不过十二公里，而高度竟相差六百公尺。为了通过秦岭，必须延长线路，以减少路线的坡度；因此，这一段铁路就沿着清姜河谷，盘绕于秦岭丛山中，步步升高，重叠五层，左右辗转绕成三个马蹄形和一个“8”字形。秦岭以南，线路沿嘉陵江而下，至四川广元，这一段路多蜿蜒于秦岭和大巴山脉的高山峻岭中，除少数台地以外，多是悬崖绝壁，下临激流，先后十六次跨过嘉陵江。尤其是号称天险的灵官峡，更是峭壁遮天，江流澎湃，人们称峡内的嘉陵江转湾处为“煮人锅”，“万人坑”。过了广元，经过剑门山区，才到川西平原，这一段路仅十一点八公里。宝成路沿线不仅地势险峻，地质情况也非常复杂，山岳地区大部分是六、七级地震区，北段部分地区为古冰川地带。这些地方岩石风化严重，裂纹多，堆积层也很多，加以地下水特别旺盛，这就很容易形成坍方、滑坡、流石、流泥等种种路基病害。这些自然条件，都造成了工程的复杂和艰巨性。
    被建设社会主义的崇高理想鼓舞着的十余万筑路职工，他们拿出移山倒海的精神，想尽一切办法，英勇地向凶山恶水进行斗争。四年多的时间，他们不知掏空了多少座大山，削平了多少个高峰。让高山低头，让河水让路，这在英勇的筑路职工的工作中，已经是很平常的事了。当铁路修到观音山附近的时候，四座山头挡住了去路，修筑铁路的职工们在苏联专家的帮助下，利用相当于五个火车车皮的炸药，一次削去了四个山头，爆破了二十万立方公尺的石方，工人们就利用这块平坦的地方铺上了铁路，修起了车站。由于这次爆破，缩短了工期五个月，降低成本七万六千元。被人们称为云霄车站的青石崖车站，三年前还有悬崖峭壁和万丈深沟挡住前进的道路。为了战胜这座高山，工人们无论在寒风怒吼的夜晚或是风雪交加的白天，总是拉着麻绳攀登在悬崖峭壁上。崖上没有立足的地方，他们就用绳子拴在自己身上，悬在半空中开凿放炮的导峒空眼，然后在凿开的洞中放进三百四十吨炸药，炸掉相当于十五层楼房的高峰，填平了深谷，修成了这个车站。
    在宝成路修建过程中，筑路工人们打穿了三百零四座山，修成隧道。沿线共修建桥梁九百九十多座。另外，为了防止坍方、滑坡等病害，还修了很多挡土墙、明洞、支墙、渗水盲沟等工程。
    宝成铁路像一所设备齐全的铁路大学一样，在建设过程中为国家培养了成千上万的技术干部和工人。建设宝成路除少数原有铁路员工以外，绝大部分是农民和城市贫民，也有些从部队转业来的解放军和志愿军战士。他们刚刚到现场的时候，有些人连隧道都没有看见过，现在已经成了熟练的隧道工人；有些从农村来的工人开始时听到小型爆破的声音就害怕，现在已经成了掌握大爆破技术的熟练工人；还有很多临时工人学会了开山、压浆等各种各样的技术。他们不但初步掌握了技术，而且为了早日建成这条幸福之路，想尽办法迅速地提高了技术水平和工作效率。如第六工程局工人开始建隧道时，每月只能完成二十到三十公尺，到1956年已经达到一百公尺。工程技术人员在宝成路建设中的提高也是非常迅速的。在开始动工时的很多刚从学校毕业的学生，经过几年的锻炼已经成了工程师；原来的老工程师通过这几年的锻炼，经验也更加丰富了。过去很多工程师们都没有办法解决的技术问题，现在一般的技术工人就可以解决了。有了这样坚强而勇敢的建设队伍，有了这样丰富的经验，今后还有什么样困难的筑路工程能挡住我们呢？
