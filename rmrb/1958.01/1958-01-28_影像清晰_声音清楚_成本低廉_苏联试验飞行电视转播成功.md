Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 27th (TASS dispatch): Staff members of the Odessa Electrical Engineering Communications Research Institute in the Soviet Union recently used a special aircraft to successfully test broadcast the television broadcasts of the Bucharest Television Center to various cities in Ukraine. The experimental aircraft was equipped with two antennas, one for receiving and one for transmitting. When the aircraft flew dozens of kilometers away from Kyiv, heading towards Odessa, television images broadcast by Bucharest were received on the television screen. At this time, the altitude was about three thousand meters. When the aircraft rose to an altitude of five thousand meters, the image became clearer and the sound became clearer. During this experiment, the scientific staff on the plane rebroadcast Bucharest's television broadcasts for two hours.

Scientists in Odessa have proven through experiments that it is possible to retransmit the broadcasts of various television centers in Ukraine. The results of these experiments are very satisfactory. They are planning to turn experimental retransmissions into regular retransmissions (currently, trial regular retransmissions are carried out three times a week), and plan to install televisions on passenger planes on the Odessa-Kyiv route.

Aircraft retransmission is also economically beneficial. The cost of retransmitting for one hour is 80% lower than the cost of broadcasting for one hour from a fixed television center.

    影像清晰　声音清楚　成本低廉
    苏联试验飞行电视转播成功
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联敖德萨电工通讯研究所的工作人员最近利用一架特种飞机成功地为乌克兰各城市试验转播了布加勒斯特电视中心的电视广播。试验飞机上装有两根天线，一根是接收天线，一根是发射天线。当飞机飞离基辅数十公里，向着敖德萨航行时，电视机的萤光屏上就收到了布加勒斯特所广播的电视影像。这时的高度约为三千公尺。当飞机上升到五千公尺高空时，影像更为清晰，声音也更清楚。在这次试验中，飞机上的科学工作人员转播了布加勒斯特的电视广播达两小时。
    敖德萨的科学家通过试验证明，转播乌克兰各电视中心的广播是可能的。这些试验的结果令人十分满意。他们正打算把试验性的转播变成定期转播（目前，每星期试行三次定期转播），并且打算在敖德萨—基辅航线的客机上装置电视机。
    飞机转播在经济上也是有利的。转播一小时的成本比固定电视中心广播一小时的成本要低80％。
