Xinhua News Agency report:

    The southern Anhui tea region, famous for producing "Qihong" and "Tunlv" teas, is experiencing a very busy winter production season. Farmers in various counties are actively applying soil and fertilizer and managing tea gardens to protect the tea plants through the winter. The area of tea gardens in the entire southern Anhui tea region that has been treated with soil and fertilizer has reached 83,600 mu. In the main producing areas such as She County and Xiuning County, more than 70% of the tea garden area has undergone soil and fertilizer application. This work is still in progress.
    The farmers in the southern Anhui tea region, organized and supported by the state, are highly motivated to develop tea production. The tea region farmers are now preparing to manufacture a large number of tea rolling machines and tea fixation machines, so that all the tea produced this year can be rolled and fixed by machine. More than 150 carpenters have been trained in key tea-producing counties such as Qimen, She County, Xiuning, and Ningguo to make these machines.

    皖南茶区生产忙
    据新华社讯　以出产“祁红”、“屯绿”著名的皖南茶区，冬季生产十分繁忙。各县农民正积极培土施肥，进行茶园管理，保护茶棵过冬。整个皖南茶区培土施肥的茶园面积已达八万三千六百亩，主要产地歙县、休宁等县70％以上的茶园面积经过了培土施肥。目前这一工作仍在进行。
    组织起来的皖南茶区农民，在国家的支持下，对发展茶叶生产的积极性很高。茶区农民现在正准备制作大批的揉茶机和杀青机，以便今年所产的茶叶全部用机器揉捻、杀青。祁门、歙县、休宁、宁国等重点产茶县已经训练了制作这种机器的木工一百五十多人。
