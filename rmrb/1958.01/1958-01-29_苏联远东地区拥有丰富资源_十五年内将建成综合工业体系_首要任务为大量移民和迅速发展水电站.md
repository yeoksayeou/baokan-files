Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th - Stochinko, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Far Eastern Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently published an article in "Industrial Economics Newspaper" stating that within the next fifteen years, the Soviet Far East will become a region with comprehensive development of various industrial sectors.

Stochinko said that the Far East region is extremely rich in resources, with various mineral deposits such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals. Its forest resources are more abundant than those in Siberia and the Urals, and its water resources amount to 70 million kilowatts. It also has vast tracts of land available for cultivation, with 10 million hectares of wasteland in the Amur River basin (i.e., the Heilongjiang River on the Sino-Soviet border) within the Soviet territory alone.

Regarding the comprehensive development of the Far East region within fifteen years, Stochinko said that the most practical issue is the migration of residents to the Far East. Currently, there are only over four million residents in the Far East region's 3.1 million square kilometers of land. In addition to immigration, another way to develop the productive forces of the Far East is to rapidly increase labor productivity. The key to solving this issue is to rapidly increase electricity production, primarily through the development of hydropower stations. The long-term plan for the Amur Economic Zone for 1959 to 1965 stipulates the construction of the Upper Zeysk Hydropower Station with a generating capacity of 800,000 kilowatts. Once completed, this hydropower station can eliminate the flooding of the Zeysk-Bureinsk plain and create a deep-water waterway in the northern part of the Amur Oblast.

He also said that in the next fifteen years, it is very appropriate to build hydropower stations with large reservoirs on the various rivers of the Amur River and Ussuri River systems. The construction of all these hydropower stations should be carried out in close cooperation with China.

Stochinko said that abundant and inexpensive electricity makes it possible to produce non-ferrous metals, light metals, and rare metals in the Far East, and the development of the chemical industry is related to the non-ferrous metal industry. The Far East region has abundant raw materials for producing sulfuric acid, boric acid, nitric acid, and their salt compounds.

Regarding the establishment of a ferrous metallurgical base in the Far East region, Stochinko said that it is still too early to design and establish a ferrous metallurgical base in this region before the completion of the third ferrous metallurgical base in Eastern Siberia. The correct approach is to further expand the region's existing steel industry.

Stochinko also said that the Far East region must also develop the machinery manufacturing industry. In this regard, in addition to first expanding existing enterprises, factories should also be established to manufacture mining machinery, woodworking machinery, machinery for the fish and paper industries, and agricultural machinery suitable for the Far East region. Shipbuilding is a major industrial sector in the Far East region. In fifteen years, the Pacific coast should become the largest base for building and repairing fishing boats, transport ships, and whaling ships. As basic construction investment in the Far East region increases year by year, the construction and building materials industries here must also be developed.

    苏联远东地区拥有丰富资源
    十五年内将建成综合工业体系
    首要任务为大量移民和迅速发展水电站
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联科学院远东分院主席团副主席斯托秦科最近在“工业经济报”上发表文章说，在最近十五年内，苏联远东地区将成为一个各种工业部门综合发展的地区。
    斯托秦科说，远东地区的资源非常丰富，这里有黑色金属、有色金属和稀有金属等各种矿藏，它的森林资源比西伯利亚、乌拉尔等地区还多，水力资源达七千万瓩。这里还有着广大的可供开垦的土地，仅只苏联境内的阿穆尔河（即中苏边境的黑龙江）流域的荒地就有一千万公顷。
    谈到在十五年内综合发展远东地区的问题时，斯托秦科说，最实际的问题是向远东地区迁移居民。目前，在远东地区的三百一十万平方公里的土地上只有四百多万居民。除移民外，发展远东生产力的另一条道路是迅速提高劳动生产率。解决这一关键问题的方法是迅速提高电力生产，这首先是发展水电站。阿穆尔经济区拟订的1959年到1965年的远景计划，规定修建一座发电能力为八十万瓩的上泽伊斯克水电站。这座水电站建成后可以免除泽伊斯克—布列英斯克平原的水患，并且在阿穆尔州北部造成深水航道。
    他还说，在最近十五年内，在阿穆尔河和乌苏里江系统的各条河流上建造带有大型水库的水电站是非常适宜的。所有这些水电站的建筑都应该和中国密切合作。
    斯托秦科说，丰富低廉的电力使得有可能在远东生产有色金属、轻金属和稀有金属，和建立有色金属工业有关的是发展化学工业。远东地区有丰富的原料可以生产硫酸、硼酸、硝酸以及它们的盐类化合物。
    关于在远东地区建立黑色冶金基地的问题，斯托秦科说，在东西伯利亚第三黑色冶金基地建成以前，在这个地区设计建立黑色冶金基地还为时尚早。正确的方法是进一步扩大这个地区现有的钢铁工业。
    斯托秦科还说，远东地区还必须发展机械制造工业。在这方面除了首先扩建现有的企业外，还应该建立制造矿山机械、木材加工机械、鱼类和造纸工业用机器、以及适合远东地区用的农业机器的工厂。造船业是远东地区主要的工业部门。在十五年后，太平洋沿岸应该成为建造和修理渔船、运输船、捕鲸船的最大基地。由于远东地区基本建设投资逐年增加，还必须发展这里的建筑和建筑材料工业。
