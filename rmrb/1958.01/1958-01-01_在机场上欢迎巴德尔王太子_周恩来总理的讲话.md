Your Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense of the Kingdom of Yemen, Friends, Comrades:

The government of China and the Chinese people feel very honored to have His Royal Highness Prince Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense of the Kingdom of Yemen, visit our country at the invitation of our government. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and the distinguished Yemeni guests who have come to China with him.

China and Yemen have had close friendly relations and trade exchanges since ancient times. In the 15th century, Zheng He, the Ming Dynasty navigator of China, visited the coastal areas of Yemen and the port of Aden. We are very pleased to see that the traditional friendship between our two countries is now being restored and developed under new circumstances.

Western colonialists once severed the relations between our two countries for a considerable period of time, but once colonialism was repelled, the friendly relations between our two countries rapidly developed again. During the Bandung Conference, the delegations of our two countries conducted friendly contacts and cooperation; in September last year, China and Yemen established diplomatic relations. This has opened up new prospects for the traditional friendship between our two peoples. In this regard, the contributions made by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince are worthy of our praise. I believe that Your Highness's visit to China this time will further promote the development of friendly relations between China and Yemen and will help the unity between the peoples of Asian and African countries.

Let me once again extend a warm welcome to His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr.

Long live the friendship between China and Yemen!

Long live Asian-African and world peace!

    在机场上欢迎巴德尔王太子
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下，朋友们，同志们：
    也门王国副首相兼外交和国防大臣塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下应我国政府的邀请前来我国访问，我国政府和我国人民感到十分荣幸。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，向王太子殿下和随同王太子一起来我国访问的也门贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    中国和也门在历史上很早就有过密切的友好关系和贸易往来。在十五世纪，中国明代航海家郑和就到过也门的沿海地区和亚丁港访问。我们很高兴地看到，现在我们两国间的传统友谊又在新的情况下得到恢复和发展。
    西方殖民主义者曾经在相当长的时间内割断了我们两国的关系，但是当殖民主义一旦被击退以后，我们两国间的友好关系就又迅速地发展起来了。在万隆会议期间我们两国的代表团进行了友好的接触和合作；去年9月，中也两国又建立了外交关系。这就为我们两国人民的传统友谊开辟了新的前景。在这方面，王太子殿下所作出的贡献是值得我们称赞的。我相信，殿下这次访问中国，必将更进一步促进中、也两国友好关系的发展，并且有助于亚非各国人民之间的团结。
    让我再一次向穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下表示热烈的欢迎。
    中、也两国友好万岁！
    亚非和世界和平万岁！
