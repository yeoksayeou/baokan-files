Xinhua News Agency, 26th Dispatch: The People's Liberation Army’s various services and arms, units above the regiment level, have universally formulated plans to support agricultural production this year. All units have decided to provide comprehensive support to rural areas in terms of manpower, animal power, materials, and technology, helping to promote the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

    Since December of last year, leading organs of garrisons across the country have successively consulted with local Party committees to understand the arrangements for this year’s agricultural production and rural construction, as well as the support needed from the troops. Then, based on the tasks of their respective units and maximizing the satisfaction of local needs, they have developed specific plans, which, after being approved by the local Party committees, have begun to be implemented. Many units' plans not only specifically arrange for the number of voluntary labor days to be provided for supporting water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, flood prevention, and during various busy farming seasons, but also permanently assign subordinate units to liaise with various agricultural production cooperatives to provide timely support.

    The Nanjing Troops plan to use a total of 4.2 million voluntary labor days this year to support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, a figure that exceeds the total number of voluntary labor days used to support agricultural production last year by more than four and a half times. Officers and soldiers supporting the Huangma Reservoir construction project at Zijin Mountain have contributed more than 26,400 labor days in the past month, completing more than 21,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The Fujian Front troops, amidst tense combat readiness and training, have decided to support the local area with 2.25 million labor days this year. A certain division of the Guangxi Garrison has decided to use a total of 189,000 labor days this year to support the local masses in building water conservancy projects and engaging in agricultural production. In January alone, they will use 120,000 voluntary labor days to support the construction of ten large and small reservoirs in the suburbs of Guilin City and Lingui County.

    A certain unit of the Hebei Garrison has decided to allocate 5,000 labor days from all voluntary labor days to participate in fertilizer accumulation. This year, they plan to accumulate 3.55 million catties of fertilizer and distribute it all, free of charge, to agricultural cooperatives near the garrison. The unit's plan also stipulates that all army horses will contribute a total of 6,600 workdays this year to support agricultural cooperatives. A certain division's plan also stipulates that it will promptly help agricultural cooperatives repair agricultural tools, tractors, locomobiles, plows, waterwheels, sprayers, and other related parts, and assist in troubleshooting. They will also conduct one epidemic prevention inspection of agricultural cooperatives' livestock each in the spring and autumn, and regularly accept medical treatment for sick horses from agricultural cooperatives. In addition, this unit plans to help agricultural cooperatives train health workers and midwives; and in January and February, it will conduct intensive training for sixty veterinary epidemic prevention personnel in two townships where it is stationed.

    In order to support agricultural mechanization, some tank units have decided to help tractor stations repair machines, help solve technical difficulties, and provide material support whenever possible. A certain unit of the Railway Corps has also decided that relevant technical personnel will provide technical guidance when agricultural cooperatives build water conservancy projects and help agricultural cooperatives solve the difficulty of lacking some tools.

    各地驻军支援农业生产大跃进
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军各军种、兵种团以上单位普遍制订今年支援农业生产的规划，各部队都决定从人力、畜力、物力和技术等各个方面给予农村以全面支援，帮助促进农业生产的大跃进。
    从去年12月起，全国各地驻军领导机关便陆续向当地党委了解了对今年农业生产和农村建设的安排，以及需要部队支援的情况。然后根据自己部队的任务，在尽最大可能满足当地需要的基础上，做出了具体规划，并经当地党委批准后开始组织部队实施。很多部队的规划中，不仅具体安排了对支援兴修水利、积肥、防汛和在各个农忙季节所要提供的义务劳动日，还把所属部队固定地分配同各个农业生产合作社联系，以便及时地给予支援。
    南京部队计划今年共用四百二十万个义务劳动日来支援农业生产大跃进，这个数字超过去年支援农业生产的义务劳动日总数的四倍半以上。支援紫金山下黄马水库建设工程的官兵们，近一月来已支援了二万六千四百多个劳动日，完成了二万一千五百多土方。福建前线部队在紧张的战备和训练中，今年决定支援驻地二百二十五万个劳动日。广西驻军某师决定今年共用十八万九千个劳动日支援驻地群众兴修水利和进行农业生产，今年1月份就将用十二万个义务劳动日支援桂林市郊和临桂县的十个大小水库的建设工程。
    河北驻军某部决定在全部义务劳动日中抽出五千个劳动日来参加积肥工作，今年计划积肥三百五十五万斤，并无代价地全部分送给驻地附近的农业社。这支部队在规划中还决定全部军马今年共抽出六千六百个工作日支援农业社。某师在规划中亦决定要及时帮助农业社修配农具、拖拉机、锅驼机、犁、水车、喷雾器等有关的零件和协助排除故障，并在春季、秋季对农业社的牲畜各进行一次防疫检查，平时还接受农业社病马的医疗工作。此外，这支部队还计划帮助农业社训练卫生员、接生员；并在1、2月份为驻地两个乡集训六十名兽医防疫员。
    为了支援农业机械化，一些坦克部队决定帮助拖拉机站修理机器、帮助解决技术上的困难，并在可能条件下给予物质支援。铁道兵某部还决定有关的技术人员在农业社兴修水利时给予技术指导和帮助农业社解决所缺一部分工具的困难。
