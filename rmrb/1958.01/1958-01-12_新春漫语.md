    New Year Musings
    Japan　Neishan Wanzao
    As the old saying goes, the whole year's work depends on a good start in spring. Now, like everyone else, I am following this saying and making plans for the year at the beginning of the New Year in 1958.
    1957 was a year that marked a very significant line in the human century. No matter how much anyone boasts, the fact that Soviet science took the lead cannot be erased. The Soviet satellite that is orbiting the Earth day and night above our heads is proof of this. Fortunately, this fact was created by people who advocate peaceful competition, which makes me believe that world peace has taken a big step forward, even a hundred steps. I remember what a friend said on August 15, 1945, when Japan announced its unconditional surrender. He said that Japan's surrender would mark the end of world wars; because future wars would inevitably be atomic wars, and once a war breaks out, the problem would not only be about victory or defeat, but would also bring endless disasters to the world, so there would be no more world wars in the future. Judging from the current situation, his words may become a reality, and this is what I am happy to pray for. However, not everyone in the world is smart, and there are still many bastards. Bastards can do anything, and thinking of this, we must make greater efforts to eliminate war. Especially since Japan was still steeped in militarism not long ago, and caused a lot of disasters to neighboring countries, as a Japanese, I should not forget that this year should be a year for us to deeply reflect. For several years, I have been committed to the Japan-China friendship movement, because I believe that the friendship between Japan and China will be an important step towards world peace.
    Last year, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations delegation to China and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, as well as the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation to China and five organizations, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the Red Cross Society of China, signed a joint statement, reiterating the proposition of not recognizing "two Chinas." I am excited about this.
    At this moment, I also recall the events of August 15, 1945, when Japan surrendered, dismantled its military equipment, and disarmed. At that time, I submitted a short article to a newspaper in Shanghai, in which I wrote: "Japan has now obtained the qualifications to be a peaceful runner, which is the ideal of mankind. William Blake has a painting: a naked youth, whose body emits a radiant light. I saw Japan in this painting. No need to look left and right. Although the lamp of peace is far away, take it as your goal and run straight along the road of peace!" The new Japanese constitution, which was formulated shortly thereafter, explicitly stipulated in Article 9 that Japan would forever renounce war, which made me even happier. However, the reality afterwards cannot but make people feel worried. Now Japan already has an army that it should not have.
    After the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan was concluded in 1951, I also submitted articles to newspapers and magazines, arguing that only the People's Republic of China can represent China, but very few were published. At that time, I gave speeches everywhere, always emphasizing that concluding a peace treaty with the Taiwan government was wrong and a farce. I still say that now. This is to put our motherland Japan on the right path, and this is my biggest wish. In the past, when boasting of its military strength, Japan acted recklessly, and now it has been reduced to a semi-colonial weak country, and it is absolutely impossible to act recklessly again. "Justice is the shield of the weak," this is the only way for Japan to rise again. If Japan takes the path of justice, the future will be bright. And this is the path to Asian peace and world peace. I think Japan must never take the path of unreasonableness and illegality again.
    The people of Japan and China should further strengthen their unity and promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China as soon as possible. My personal strength is certainly limited, but "three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang," and "the voice of the masses is sacred." Some people say that even if tens of millions of zeros are put together, they are still zero. But I think that there is no completely empty zero in real life. As long as there is living life, the voice of the masses will be sacred. Our lives may be close to zero, but as long as we concentrate the voice of the masses and make it sacred, we can win world peace. Japan-China friendship is the first step towards world peace, and I would like to encourage everyone.
    Long live Japan-China friendship!
    Long live world peace!

    新春漫语
    日本　内山完造
    老话说，一年之计在于春。我现在也和旁人一样，按照这句老话，在1958年新春之始立下了一年之计。
    1957年，是在人类世纪划上了极其显著的一条线的一年。不管什么人怎样逞威风，但苏联科学占了首位这个事实，却是抹杀不了的。现在在我们头上日夜不停绕着地球飞翔的苏联人造卫星就是证明。这一事实，幸而是由主张和平竞赛的人们所创造的，这使我确信世界和平又向前迈出了很大一步，甚至百步。我想起1945年8月15日日本宣布无条件投降时一位朋友的话。他说，日本的投降将为世界战争打上终止符；因为今后的战争必然是原子战争，战争一旦爆发，问题就不仅仅在于胜败，而且会给世界人类带来无穷灾难，所以今后不再会有世界性的战争了。从目前的情况看来，他的话似乎可能成为事实，而这也是我所欣喜祈求的。然而，世界上不都是聪明人，也还有很多混蛋。混蛋是什么事都干得出来的，想到这点，我们就必须为消灭战争进行更大的努力。特别是不久以前，日本还浸透了军国主义，给邻近各国制造了很多灾难，作为一个日本人不应忘记这一年应该是我们深加反省的一年。几年来，我曾致力于日中友好运动，因为我相信日本和中国的友好将是导向世界和平的重要的一步。
    去年恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团和中国人民外交学会，以及日中友好协会访华代表团和中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民外交学会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国国际贸易促进委员会、中国红十字会五团体签订了共同声明，重申了不承认“两个中国”的主张。对于这点，我感到兴奋。
    此际，我又想起1945年8月15日日本投降、撤销军备、解除武装时的事情。我当时曾向上海的报纸投寄一篇短文，其中写道：“日本现在才得到了作为人类理想的和平的赛跑者的资格。威廉·布莱克有一幅画：一个赤裸的青年，身体放出了灿然的光。我在这幅画上看到了日本。无需左顾右盼。和平之灯虽然遥远，但以它为目标，沿着和平的大道笔直地跑吧！”不久以后制定的日本新宪法，其中第九条明文规定了日本永远放弃战争，这使我更加高兴。但以后的现实却使人不能不感到忧虑。现在日本已经拥有它所不应拥有的军队了。
    1951年旧金山对日和约缔结以后，我也向报纸、杂志投寄了文章，主张只有中华人民共和国才能代表中国，但刊载出来的极少。当时，我在各地讲演，一直强调同台湾政府缔结和约是错误的，是一出丑剧。现在我仍然这样说。这是为了使我们的祖国日本走上正路，而这也是我怀抱的最大愿望。从前，矜夸武力雄强的时候，日本曾一味蛮干，现在已经沦为半殖民地的弱国，再要蛮干是绝对行不通了。“正义是弱者的盾牌”，这是日本唯一再起的道路。日本走正义之路，前途才会是光明的。而且这是通向亚洲和平、世界和平的道路。我以为日本绝对不能再走非理非法之道了。
    日中两国人民应该进一步加强团结，早日促进日中邦交的恢复。我一个人的力量固然有限，但“三个臭皮匠，赛过诸葛亮”，“大众的声音是神圣的”。有人说，零凑起千万个仍然是零。但我以为现实生活中完全空洞无物的零是没有的。只要有活着的生命，大众的声音就会是神圣的。我们的生命也许近于零，但只要集中大众的声浪，使其成为神圣的，我们就能够赢得世界和平。日中友好是世界和平的第一步，我愿意跟大家共勉。
    日中友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
