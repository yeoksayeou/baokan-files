    Snowflake

    “Thousands of miles of snow drift” is a unique natural scene in northern China's winter. Large snowflakes dance before our eyes, as if deliberately enticing us to understand their secrets.
    At first glance, they all seem to look the same - all six-petaled, but upon closer inspection, their shapes are ever-changing and different from each other. More than four thousand different patterns have already been discovered. Some look like small stars with six rays of light, some like a flower with six petals, and some like hexagonal gemstones…
    In "Han Shi Wai Zhuan" written by Han Ying, there are these two sentences: "All plants and flowers mostly have five petals, only snowflakes have six petals." Han Ying was a person from the time of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, which would be the second century. However, in foreign countries, the phenomenon of snowflakes having six petals was not discovered until 1611 (seventeenth century) by the astronomer Kepler.
    Why do snowflakes of various shapes all have six petals?
    In nature, all matter is composed of molecules, and water is no exception. Constantly moving water molecules always try to escape the shackles of water and run into the air to roam freely, which is what is called "evaporation."
    Water on the ground evaporates quietly and continuously. Water in the sea evaporates, water in the river evaporates, water in the soil evaporates, water in living organisms also evaporates, and the water in anything evaporates, which allows the air to obtain a large amount of water vapor. However, the ability of air to absorb water is not without limit. The higher the temperature of the air, the greater its capacity to contain water vapor; the lower the temperature, the smaller its capacity to contain water vapor. When the temperature of the air decreases, the excess water vapor condenses into countless small water droplets, floating in the air, which is cloud. The small water droplets in the clouds continue to condense, becoming large water droplets, and when they fall to the ground, it is rain.
    Sometimes, however, water vapor does not necessarily condense into water. When the temperature in the high altitude is very low, it changes directly from gas to solid—ice crystals or ice grains. Most of these ice crystals or ice grains are hexagonal plates or columns. When ice crystals and ice grains fall, the temperature of the air layer they pass through is lower than their own, and the water vapor in the air continues to condense on the edges and corners of the ice crystals and ice grains, and the snowflakes become larger and larger. By the time they are about to fall to the ground, they are already large goose feather snowflakes of various shapes. This is because when they condense, due to the differences in coldness, warmth, speed, and slowness, many types are formed. There are needle-shaped, column-shaped, plate-shaped, and combinations of needle-column-shaped and plate-shaped, truly all kinds of shapes and extremely beautiful.
    People often like to compare the color of snow to the most standard white. In our lives, it is really difficult to find something whiter than snow. However, just take a snowflake and look at it carefully, and you will immediately find that the snowflake is not white, but like ice - a colorless, translucent body. How to explain this phenomenon?
    When snowflakes fall, they constantly collide and bump into each other, slowly turning into snow flakes. Many snow flakes are randomly put together, and each surface reflects a portion of light, and the surface is uneven, so the reflected light is very chaotic, so all the sunlight is reflected back. Since the accumulated snow reflects all the sunlight back, it naturally looks white. Although ice has no color, when the ice is smashed, it also turns white. The place where the glass is broken looks white, which is also the reason.
    There was such a thing: In the past, in places near the Arctic, a kind of red snow often fell. At that time, superstitious people were very afraid, thinking that the heavens were angry and brought down a disaster. In fact, this is a trick played by the wind. The wind rolled a kind of red algae plant into the air. This algae is not afraid of the cold and reproduces very quickly, and can even grow and reproduce in the snow. As long as the wind brings its spores to a place, the snow will turn red in a few hours.
    Some people have also seen green snow with their own eyes, which is also due to the wind blowing up algae plants, the difference being that this algae plant is green.
    Once, in a city in England, a black snow fell. This unexpected thing was quickly answered. It turned out that the coal smoke coming out of the power station chimney collided with the snowflakes and fell down, which became black snow.

    雪花
    林雯
    “万里雪飘”是北国的冬天独有的自然景色。雪花大片大片地在我们眼前飞舞着，好像故意引诱我们去了解她的秘密。
    乍一看来，她们好像都长得一模一样——都是六瓣，但仔细一看，它们的形状又是千变万化，各有不同。已经发现的，就有四千种以上不同的花纹。有的像有六条光芒的小星星，有的像一朵有六片花瓣的鲜花，又有的像六棱的宝石，……。
    在韩婴著的“韩诗外传”中有这样两句话：“凡草木花多五出，雪花独六出”。韩婴是汉文帝时代的人，算起来那时才是第二世纪。然而，在外国，雪花是六瓣的现象直到1611年（十七世纪）才由天文学家刻卜勒发现。
    为什么各种不同形状的雪花，又都是由六个花瓣组成的呢？
    在自然界里，任何物质都是由分子构成的，水当然也不例外。不断地运动着的水分子，总要竭力摆脱水对它的束缚，跑到空中去逍遥自在的游来游去，这就是所谓的“蒸发”。
    地面上的水，永不间断地、悄悄地蒸发着。海里的水在蒸发，河里的水在蒸发，土壤里的水在蒸发，生物体内的水也在蒸发，任何东西体内的水分都在蒸发，这就使空气中获得了大量的水蒸气。但是，空气吸收水分的本领也不是没有限度的。空气的温度越高，含蓄水蒸气的能力越大；温度越低，含蓄水蒸气的能力越小。当空气的温度减低时，多余的水蒸气就凝结成无数的小水滴，飘浮在空中，这就是云。云里的小水滴继续凝结，成了大水滴，落到地面上，就是雨。
    有时，水蒸气却并不一定凝结成水。当高空的温度很低的时候，它就由气体直接变成固体——冰晶或冰粒。这些冰晶或冰粒，大多都是六角形的板状体或柱状体。当冰晶和冰粒下降时，通过的空气层的温度比它本身更低，空气中的水蒸气就继续在冰晶和冰粒的棱角上凝结，雪花也就越长越大，快降到地面上的时候，已经是各种形状的鹅毛大雪了。这是因为在它们凝结的时候，由于冷、暖和快、慢的不同，所以形成的种类很多。有针状的，有柱状的，有板状的，也有针柱状和板状结合的，真是形形色色，极其美观。
    人们常喜欢把雪的颜色比做最标准的白色。在我们的生活里，也实在难以找到比雪更白的东西了。可是，只要取一个雪花来仔细看一下就立刻会发现，雪花并不是白色的，而是像冰一样——无色的半透明体。怎样解释这种现象呢？
    雪花在降落的时候，不断地碰碰撞撞，慢慢地变成了雪片。许多雪片任意地凑在一起，每一面都要反射一部分光线，而表面高低不平，反射出来的光线很乱，因此太阳光就被全部反射回来。既然积雪把太阳光全部反射回来，自然看起来就是白色的。冰虽然没有颜色，可是当冰被砸碎以后，也会变成白色。玻璃打碎了的地方，看起来是白色，也正是这个原故。
    曾经有过这样的事：从前，在靠近北极的地方，常常降一种红色的雪。当时迷信的人很害怕，认为是上天发怒降下灾难。其实，这是风玩的把戏。风把一种红色藻类植物，卷到了半空中。这种藻类不怕寒冷，繁殖得很快，甚至可以在雪里生长繁殖，只要风把它的胚芽带到一个地方，几小时之后，雪就整个变成了红色。
    也有人亲眼见过绿色的雪，这也是由于风吹起了藻类植物，不同的是这种藻类植物是绿色的。
    还有一次，在英国的一个城市里，降了一场黑色的雪。这个出乎意料的事，很快就得到了答案，原来是从发电站烟囱里冒出来的煤烟和雪花碰在一起，又随着降了下来，这就成了黑雪。
