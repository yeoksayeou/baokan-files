To the Editor:
    I am a prospecting worker with a monthly income of over seventy yuan, which covers the food, clothing, and other expenses of my family of four. However, because we live in a remote mountain area with high prices, coupled with business trips, relocation expenses, and family illnesses, even though I am careful with expenses, my family's finances are still quite strained. Sometimes, I even find myself looking forward to payday in the middle of the month. Therefore, I am determined to respond to the government's call to mobilize family members to return to their hometowns to participate in production and send my family back to my hometown.
    My family is of middle-peasant background, and my wife used to work in the fields in the countryside. Since she came with me, my family has felt a lack of manpower. The only people in the family who can work are my elder brother and sister-in-law. Sending my wife back home will be a help to the family, and it can also reduce my personal burden and the encumbrance of household chores, allowing me to concentrate my energy on work. At the same time, it can also reduce the country's expenses, such as housing, furniture, medical expenses, and material supplies. I think this is not a small expense. For example, this year, my family and I spent more than one hundred yuan in relocation allowances because of the change in our work area. The employees of our prospecting team's preliminary survey team have many opportunities to relocate. If everyone brought their families with them, the expense of these relocation allowances would be considerable. In addition to sending my own family back to the countryside, I will also try my best to persuade others to do the same.

    我决心把家属送回老家编辑同志：
    我是一个勘探工作人员，每月收入七十多元，供一家四口人的吃穿等费用。但是，由于住在交通不便的高山上，物价较贵，再加上出差、调差和家人疾病等原因，虽然平日注意节约，我家的经济还是比较困难，有时甚至月中就盼月底发薪。因此，我决意响应政府关于动员家属回乡参加生产的号召，把家属送回老家去。
    我家是中农成份，我的妻子原先也在农村种地。自从她跟我出来后，家里很感人力缺乏。全家能劳动的只有我哥嫂二人。我把妻子送回家去，这对家里是一个帮助，而且也可以减轻我个人的负担和生活琐事的牵累，把精力集中在工作上，同时也可以减少国家的开支，如住房、家具、药费和物资供应等等。我觉得，这不是一笔很小的开支。例如，今年我和家属因为调动工作地区，就花了公家调差费一百多元。我们勘探队预查队的职工，调动的机会是很多的，如果大家都带着家属，这笔调差费的开支是不小的。我除了把自己的家属送回乡下外，还要尽可能说服别人也这样作。
