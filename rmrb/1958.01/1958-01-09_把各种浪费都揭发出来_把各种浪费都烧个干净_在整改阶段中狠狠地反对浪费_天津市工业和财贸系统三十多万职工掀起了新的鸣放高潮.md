    (Special dispatch from Tianjin by our newspaper and Xinhua News Agency) In the rectification phase of the rectification movement, Tianjin's industrial and financial-trade systems have already stirred up a new high tide of airing views. Over 300,000 workers are concentrating their fire on the key issue in industrial and financial-trade work: business (production) management. Through big-character posters, airing-of-views meetings, and other means, the workers have exposed a large number of shocking facts of waste.

    Some waste is caused by leading cadres who fail to investigate and research, and blindly purchase and stock goods. For example, in order to build a slaughterhouse, the Food Company bought 1.2 million bricks and 100,000 tiles from other places and contracted the project to the Fifth Construction Company. As a result, the materials were unqualified and sold back to the construction company, resulting in a loss of more than 16,000 yuan. The Cultural Supplies Purchasing Station inspected 149 kinds of commodities, and found that losses due to blind purchases, lax inspections, resulting in stockpiling, mildew, deterioration, or being substandard, amounted to more than 1.07 million yuan. According to statistics of 22 cases of blind purchases exposed by the industrial and financial-trade systems in Heping District, a total of more than 890,000 yuan was wasted and more than 13 million yuan of funds were tied up.

    Some waste is caused by only caring about production and not about quality and cost, only caring about business and not about profits and losses. For example, the leading cadres of the Internal Combustion Engine Factory produced more than 1,900 units of new products when the initial experiment was successful, but many problems had not been resolved. The vast majority of them had problems and could not be used and needed to be modified. The Printing Company bought 20,000 reams of banknote paper from Beijing, which was difficult to sell. It used 1,000 reams to print playing cards, but the cost was high and the price could not be raised, resulting in a loss of 7,000 yuan. In 1956, the Sugar, Fruit and Products Company transported a batch of bananas from the south, and more than 100,000 jin rotted due to improper care along the way. In October last year, another approximately 80,000 jin of bananas rotted and turned black during transportation because no one took care of them.

    More seriously, management is chaotic, there are no systems, and no one is responsible, resulting in shocking waste. For example, the Steel Rolling Mill No. 1 used steel ingots to pave the yard when it rained last summer due to chaotic on-site management. More than 100 tons of steel were pressed into the ground alone. Because of the lack of planning, stacking steel ingots improperly seemed to be a common occurrence. According to statistics, improper stacking alone wasted more than 46,000 yuan last year. Workshops 1 and 2 of this factory are in the same yard, but the raw materials supplied by Workshop 1 to Workshop 2 are transported by carts, which wasted more than 36,000 yuan in 1957 alone.

    Lax acceptance inspection, poor storage, or reluctance to sell are also important reasons for losses and waste. The Cultural Supplies Purchasing and Supply Station relaxed the inspection of goods, allowing many shoddy and substandard goods to enter the warehouse, causing a large number of goods to become moldy, damaged, and defective. The warehouse keepers of this purchasing station stored a large number of heat-sensitive crayons on the third floor. After a summer, most of them leaked oil and the colors bled. The reed organs were originally labeled "Do Not Invert," but the warehouse keepers unilaterally stacked them horizontally and inverted in order to save warehouse space, resulting in the reed organs being out of tune and unsellable. The Shoe and Hat Company bought a batch of children's hats, but was reluctant to sell them last spring. The department store asked for only a few dozen dozen, and thousands of dozen are still stockpiled and no one wants them.

    In addition to the subjective idealism and bureaucratism of the leading cadres, all of these are also due to the fact that many cadres have developed the thinking and style of being from a large family with a big business and abundant wealth, and do not cherish state property at all. For example, the Nankai District Coal Briquette General Store had planned in advance to lose more than 40,000 yuan in the business plan for the third quarter of last year.

    把各种浪费都揭发出来  把各种浪费都烧个干净
    在整改阶段中狠狠地反对浪费
    天津市工业和财贸系统三十多万职工掀起了新的鸣放高潮
    本报特约新华社天津讯　天津市工业、财贸系统在整风运动的整改阶段中，已经掀起了一个新的鸣放高潮，三十多万职工把火力集中到工业财贸工作中的关键问题——经营（生产）管理。通过大字报、鸣放会等方式，职工们揭发了大量的惊人的浪费事实。
    有些浪费是由于领导干部不调查、不研究，盲目购置和盲目进货所造成的。如食品公司为修建屠宰场，从外地买来砖一百二十万块，瓦十万匹，将工程包给第五建筑公司，结果用料不合格，转卖给建筑公司，损失一万六千多元。文化用品采购站检查了一百四十九种商品，其中因盲目进货、检查不严，以致积压、霉坏变质或不合格而造成的损失，竟达一百零七万多元。据和平区工业、财贸两个系统揭发的二十二件盲目进货的事例统计，共浪费八十九万多元，积压资金一千三百多万元。
    有些浪费是由于只顾生产不顾质量和成本，只管经营不管盈亏所造成的。如内燃机厂的领导干部在新产品初步试验成功但还有许多问题没有得到解决的时候，就生产了一千九百多台，绝大部分有毛病不能用，需要改装。印刷公司从北京买了两万令印钞纸，不好卖，用了一千令印朴克，成本高卖不上价，赔了七千元。糖业果品公司1956年从南方运来一批香焦，因沿途照管不当，曾烂掉十万多斤；去年10月间，又有约八万斤香焦在运输途中，因无人照管而全部腐烂变黑。
    更严重的是管理混乱，没有制度，无人负责，造成了惊人的浪费。例如轧钢一厂因为现场管理混乱，去年夏季下雨时就用钢锭垫院子，仅压在地下的钢材就有一百多吨；因为缺乏计划，倒垛钢锭好像成了家常便饭。据统计，去年内因倒垛不当就浪费四万六千多元。这个厂的一、二车间在一个院子里，而一车间供应第二车间的原料却雇用大车搬运，1957年一年中即浪费了三万六千多元。
    验收不严，保管不好，或者保守惜售，也是造成损失、浪费的重要原因之一。文化用品采购供应站放松了商品检验，让许多粗制滥造、不合规格的商品进了仓库，使大量商品霉坏残损。这个采购站的保管人员把大批怕热的蜡笔存放在三层楼上，经过一个夏天，绝大部分走油串色。风琴上面本来写着“请勿倒置”，但仓库保管人员片面地为了节约仓库地位，统统横置倒放码堆，致使风琴变音卖不出去。鞋帽公司买了一批童帽，去年春季惜售，百货公司要货只给了几十打，直到现在还积压几千打没人要。
    所有这些，除了领导干部的主观主义与官僚主义的因素以外，还由于许多干部滋长了家大业大、财大气粗的思想和作风，对国家财产毫不爱惜。比如南开区煤球总店在去年第三季度的业务计划里，预先就计划赔四万多元。
