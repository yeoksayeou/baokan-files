    Criticizing Shang Yue's Historical Views
    The first issue of "Historical Research" in 1958 published an article by Comrade Liu Danian, "On Comrade Shang Yue's Preface to the Book 'Research on the Socio-Economic Formations of the Ming and Qing Dynasties,'" which raised a noteworthy issue in historical research.

    The article states that, since Marx himself, including Comrade Mao Zedong, classical writers have made many important scientific conclusions about Chinese history based on objective historical facts. Namely: (1) The feudal system lasted a very long time in Chinese history, and social development under the feudal system was very slow, even exhibiting a certain stagnation. (2) The socio-economic structure combining small-scale agriculture and household handicraft industry is a characteristic of the Chinese feudal system, and this socio-economic structure continued to play a certain role until a period after the Opium War. (3) The Anglo-Chinese Opium War of 1840 was the starting point of China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial system. The article says: These famous Marxist viewpoints are almost universally known to those who study modern Chinese history. The entire practice of the Chinese revolution has tested the correctness of these viewpoints and proved that they are in line with the actual development of history. Therefore, the study of Chinese history, especially modern history, should use these viewpoints as a guide.

    The article states: In order to establish his own peculiar views on Chinese history, Shang Yue refused to use these viewpoints as a guide and directly overturned them. In his "Preface," he exaggerated the capitalist relations in Chinese social production in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, greatly advancing the history of Chinese capitalism and changing the social nature of the Ming and Qing periods. To this end, he not only denied that the Opium War was the beginning of modern Chinese history, but also denied the long duration of Chinese feudal society and the characteristic that China still had a socio-economic structure combining small-scale agriculture and household handicraft industry after the Ming and Qing dynasties, especially after the Opium War. According to Shang Yue's view, the transition from the feudal system to the capitalist system in China began in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, and the late Ming and early Qing dynasties were the key to modern historical events and the starting point of modern Chinese history.

    The article states that, whether from a factual or theoretical point of view, Shang Yue's claim to negate Marxist viewpoints is untenable and incorrect. Therefore, in his interpretation of a series of important issues in modern Chinese history, he will inevitably violate the facts and engage in far-fetched interpretations. The article states: If we turn to Shang Yue's other works, we can see that the claims in the "Preface" are not isolated, and in the author's own view, they are very logical. He had fully developed these arguments in "A Preliminary Study of the Emergence and Evolution of Capitalist Relations in China," and the "Preface" is more concentrated and clearer.

    The article states that Shang Yue's negation of Marxist viewpoints and his making many novel assertions about modern Chinese history are inseparable from his very subjective and one-sided understanding of historical events, and even his anti-scientific attitude of deliberately distorting history. Therefore, his claims and his arguments are bound to be unstable and unreliable.

    The article states: Shang Yue's negation of the fundamental Marxist viewpoints on Chinese history and his claim to greatly advance the history of Chinese capitalism are not accidental; they have their origins. This origin is mainly that the erroneous views of some early Marxist historians abroad are deeply rooted in Shang Yue's thinking, coupled with the influence of erroneous viewpoints in some early domestic publications; it is a combination of these two.

    The article states: If we believe that the issues raised by Shang Yue are limited to negating the fundamental Marxist viewpoints on Chinese history and advancing the history of Chinese capitalism, we would be underestimating the problem. The "Preface" also involves the issue of revising certain basic principles of Marxism, such as the theory of the base and superstructure, and the theory of the role of violence or class struggle in overthrowing the old relations of production and laying the foundation for new relations of production.

    The article concludes: Shang Yue's claims not only touch upon almost all important issues in modern Chinese history, but also reflect a certain ideological tendency of some recent researchers, which deserves the attention of historians, especially those who study modern Chinese history.

### 批评尚钺的历史观点

    批评尚钺的历史观点
    1958年第一期“历史研究”上，发表了刘大年同志的文章——“关于尚钺同志为‘明清社会经济形态的研究’一书所写的序言”，提出了历史研究中一个值得注意的问题。
    文章中说，自马克思本人起，包括毛泽东同志在内的经典作家们根据历史发展的客观事实，对中国历史作了许多重要的科学的论断。即：（一）封建制度在中国历史上经历的时间很长，在封建制度下社会发展很迟缓，甚至呈现某种停滞状态。（二）小农业和家庭手工业结合的社会经济结构是中国封建制度的特点，直到鸦片战争以后的一个时期里，这种社会经济结构仍在发生某些作用。（三）1840年中英鸦片战争是中国半封建半殖民地制度的起点。文章说：这些马克思主义的著名论点，差不多为研究中国近代历史的人所家喻户晓。中国革命的全部实践，检验了这些观点的正确性，证明了它们合乎历史发展的实际。因此研究中国历史，尤其是近代史，应该以这些观点作为指针。
    文章说：尚钺为了树立起他自己的关于中国历史的奇异见解，拒绝以这些观点作为研究的指针，直接了当的推翻了这些观点。他在“序言”中极力夸张明末清初中国社会生产中的资本主义关系，把中国资本主义的历史大大提前，改变明清之际的社会性质。为了这个目的，就不仅否定鸦片战争是近代中国历史的开始，也一并否定中国封建社会的长期性和在明清以后，特别是在鸦片战争以后，中国还存在着小农业和家庭手工业相结合的社会经济结构这个特点。按照尚钺的见解，明清之际开始了中国从封建制度到资本主义制度的变化，明末清初是近代历史事变的关键，是中国近代历史的起点。
    文章中说，毋论从事实、从理论上讲，尚钺否定马克思主义的观点的主张都是站不住脚的，不正确的。因此，他在有关中国近代历史的一系列重要问题的解释上，就必然要违反事实，牵强附会。文章中说：翻开尚钺的其他著作，我们就可以知道“序言”上的主张并不是孤立的，在作者本人看来这还很是合乎逻辑。他早在“中国资本主义关系发生及演变的初步研究”上充分发挥过这些论点，序言上是更加集中，更加明确起来了。
    文章说，尚钺否定马克思主义观点，对中国近代历史作出许多新奇的论断，是和他的非常主观片面的理解历史事件、甚至有意歪曲历史的反科学态度分不开的。因此他的主张，他的论据就必然是站不稳的，靠不住的。
    文章说：尚钺的否定马克思主义关于中国历史的根本观点，大大提前中国资本主义历史的主张不是偶然的，有它的来历。这个来历主要是国外某些早期的马克思主义历史研究者的错误见解在尚钺思想中根深蒂固，再加上早年国内若干出版物中错误观点的影响，是这二者的结合。
    文章说：如果认为尚钺提出的问题，仅仅限于否定马克思主义关于中国历史的根本观点，提前了中国资本主义的历史，就未免估计不足。“序言”上还涉及到修改马克思主义某些基本原理的问题，如基础和上层建筑的理论、暴力或阶级斗争在推翻旧的生产关系奠定新的生产关系中的作用的理论等。
    文章最后说：尚钺的主张不仅几乎涉及中国近代历史上的所有重要问题，而且还反映出来了近来某些研究者的一种思想倾向，值得历史学家特别是研究中国近代史的人的注意。
