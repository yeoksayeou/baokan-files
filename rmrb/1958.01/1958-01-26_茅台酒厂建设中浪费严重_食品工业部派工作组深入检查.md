Maotai Distillery Construction Suffers Serious Waste
Ministry of Food Industry Dispatches Work Group for In-Depth Inspection

This newspaper reports that in 1956, the State Council, in order to improve the quality of famous liquors, decided to allocate special funds to various famous distilleries to add wine storage equipment and extend the aging period. In 1957, the state approved a basic construction investment of 1.3 million yuan for the Maotai Distillery. According to a recent preliminary inspection by the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry, the Maotai Distillery overspent by more than 410,000 yuan, accounting for more than 30% of the original plan, due to high construction standards, failure to make good use of local building materials, and the construction of a cement basketball court and the purchase of a Jeep.

After learning of this situation, the Ministry of Food Industry considered the waste at the Maotai Distillery to be serious, violating the central government's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. In order to learn from the lessons, the ministry recently organized an inspection team to go to Guizhou Province, together with relevant local departments, to conduct an in-depth inspection of the distillery's basic construction situation under the leadership of the provincial party committee. The ministry also plans to convene a meeting of the eight famous distilleries in March, after the waste situation inspection of the Maotai Distillery is completed, to comprehensively inspect the use of investment in famous liquors.

    茅台酒厂建设中浪费严重
    食品工业部派工作组深入检查
    本报讯　1956年，国务院为了提高名酒质量，决定拨一笔专款给各名酒厂，以便增添贮酒设备，延长酒龄。1957年国家批准给茅台酒厂的基本建设投资有一百三十万元。根据贵州省工业厅最近初步检查，茅台酒厂由于建设标准高，没有很好地利用当地建筑材料，以及修水泥篮球场、买吉普车等原因，共多花了四十一万多元，占原计划的30％以上。
    食品工业部了解这一情况以后，认为茅台酒厂的浪费是严重的，违反了中央勤俭建国的方针。为了吸取教训，这个部在最近组织了检查组，到贵州省会同当地有关部门，在省委领导下对这个厂的基本建设情况作深入检查。这个部还准备在茅台酒厂浪费情况检查结束以后，在3月份召开八大名酒会议，全面检查名酒投资使用情况。
