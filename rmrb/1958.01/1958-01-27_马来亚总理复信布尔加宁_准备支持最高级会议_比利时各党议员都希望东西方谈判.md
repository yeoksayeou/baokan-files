Xinhua News Agency, January 25th, dispatch from Kuala Lumpur: Malayan Federation Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, recently stated in his letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, that the Malayan government is prepared to support the Soviet government's proposal in its note of December last year to the member states of the United Nations regarding the holding of a highest-level meeting. However, the Malayan Federation Prime Minister advocated for "preparatory negotiations" before holding the highest-level meeting. In his view, such preparatory meetings are a "necessary prerequisite" for the highest-level meeting.

In the reply letter, published on the 24th, Rahman welcomed the proposal that the great powers should guarantee not to use force in the Middle East. The letter also stated that the Malayan Federation government highly welcomes the proposal regarding the free development of trade, because Malaya's prosperity largely depends on such freedom. The letter also expressed acceptance of the proposal regarding the cessation of hostile news and propaganda against other countries.

The letter stated that the Malayan Federation government "does not dare to easily agree" with the Soviet proposal regarding the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. At the same time, it said that the Malayan Federation government is prepared to support this proposal if it can make an effective contribution in some way to achieving international understanding and eliminating any threat of war.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th, dispatch from TASS, Brussels: The Belgian Chamber of Representatives' three-day debate on foreign policy concluded on the evening of the 23rd. In their speeches, parliamentarians of all parties expressed the hope for East-West negotiations to ease international tensions.

Catholic Party parliamentarian Audet said that negotiations must be held between East and West, and trade relations with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp must be strengthened.

Socialist Party member Boye advocated that East and West hold negotiations without any preconditions. He believes that Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe can serve as a starting point for negotiations. Another Socialist Party member, Pearson, advocated reaching agreements on issues such as the cessation of experimental nuclear explosions, supervised cessation of the arms race, and supervised disarmament through negotiations.

Liberal Party parliamentarian Demitter advocated a gradual rapprochement between East and West. He called on the Belgian government to more actively promote the easing of international tensions. He pointed out that Belgium must recognize People's China.

    马来亚总理复信布尔加宁
    准备支持最高级会议
    比利时各党议员都希望东西方谈判
    据新华社25日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦总理东古·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼最近在给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信中，表示马来亚政府准备支持苏联政府在去年12月致联合国各会员国的照会中提出的关于举行最高级会议的主张。但是这位马来亚联合邦总理主张在举行最高级会议以前先举行“预备谈判”。照他看来，这种预备会议是最高级会议的“必要的先决条件”。
    在24日发表的这封复信中，拉赫曼表示欢迎关于大国应当保证在中东不使用武力的建议。复信还说，马来亚联合邦政府非常欢迎关于自由发展贸易的建议，因为马来亚的繁荣在很大程度上有赖于这种自由。复信还表示接受关于停止敌视他国的新闻和宣传的建议。
    复信说，马来亚联合邦政府“不敢轻易赞同”苏联关于北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织缔结互不侵犯协定的建议。同时，它又说，马来亚联合邦政府准备支持这个建议，如果这个建议在某一方面会对达成国际谅解和消除任何战争威胁作出有效的贡献的话。
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时众议院历时三天的关于外交政策的辩论在23日晚结束。各党派议员在发言中都希望进行东西方谈判，来缓和国际紧张局势。
    天主教政党议员奥德说，必须举行东西方之间的谈判，并加强同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的贸易关系。
    社会党人博伊主张东西方举行谈判，而不附带任何先决条件。他认为，波兰关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议可以作为谈判的出发点。另一个社会党议员皮尔森主张通过谈判的途径，来就停止试验性的核爆炸、有监督地停止军备竞赛和有监督的裁军等各项问题达成协议。
    自由党议员德米特主张东西方逐渐接近。他要求比利时政府更积极地促成国际紧张局势的缓和。他指出，比利时必须承认人民中国。
