Appreciating Strange Writings Together and Turning Poisonous Weeds into Fertilizer
A Re-Criticism of Articles by Wang Shiwei, Ding Ling, Xiao Jun, Luo Feng, Ai Qing, etc.
Introducing the Revised "Literary Gazette"

(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that the newly published "Literary Gazette" in its second issue of 1958 has a special "Re-Criticism" section, publishing a batch of counter-revolutionary articles that were published fifteen years ago in the literary supplement of the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an and the literary magazine "Grain Rain": Wang Shiwei's "Wild Lily," Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8th" and "In the Hospital," Xiao Jun's "On Comradely 'Love' and 'Endurance'," Luo Feng's "Still the Era of Essays," and Ai Qing's "Understanding Writers, Respecting Writers."

These authors' names are quite familiar to readers. Several of them, not long ago, still held the titles of famous writers, only to have their true colors exposed during the anti-rightist struggle. Those who do not understand the details of these anti-Party elements may wonder why these self-proclaimed "great writers" and "great poets" with international influence, who have always claimed to be revolutionaries, would have such filthy right-wing souls. No, this is by no means an accidental event. The history of every rightist and anti-Party element is a mirror of themselves, but unfortunately, they have consistently and stubbornly adhered to their anti-Party and anti-people stance, unable to see their ugly 모습 in their own mirrors, and repeatedly refusing to be reformed. Ding Ling wrote a surrender letter in Nanjing, betraying the proletariat and the Communist Party to Chiang Kai-shek. She hid this, deceived the Party's trust, and became the editor of the "Liberation Daily" literary supplement. Luo Feng and Ai Qing also surrendered while in the enemy's prisons. However, not only did they feel no guilt, but they also carried out a series of anti-Party activities in the years that followed.

1942 was a year when the revolution was at its most difficult. Internationally, the Hitler bandit gang was frantically invading the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Red Army had not yet launched its offensive; domestically, the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek also launched a two-pronged attack on the revolutionary base areas. At that time, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was under the encirclement and blockade of the Kuomintang reactionaries, with its food and supplies cut off, and the lives of the revolutionary forces faced extreme difficulties. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued a resounding call – self-reliance and overcoming difficulties, and the entire border region launched a vigorous production campaign. At this time, loyal revolutionaries were united around the Party Central Committee, striving to temper themselves in hardship and overcome difficulties. In such a historical environment, however, the anti-Party elements in literary and art circles took advantage of the difficulties faced by the Party and the revolutionary people, and in coordination with the "encirclement and suppression" of the revolution by reactionary forces at home and abroad, launched a counter-revolutionary ideological offensive against the Party and the people. Wang Shiwei and Ding Ling used their dark eyes and dark pens, employing literary forms such as essays and novels, to portray the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an as a completely dark and gloomy place, almost a dark feudal kingdom; Xiao Jun's "On Comradely 'Love' and 'Endurance'" and Ai Qing's "Understanding Writers, Respecting Writers" even carried out unrestrained slander against revolutionary comradeship and the leadership of revolutionary literary and art work; and Luo Feng's "Still the Era of Essays" played the role of calling on anti-Party elements to rise up and use the "short sword that makes people tremble and also delights them" – the essay – to expose the so-called "dark side" of the revolution. This was their first anti-Party alliance, with articles "attacking" the revolution as their common theme.

The reactionaries saw these counter-revolutionary articles as if they had found a treasure. The Kuomintang secret service agencies in the White areas regarded their articles as excellent materials for anti-communist propaganda, giving them "obligatory" publication and mass distribution. And what was the reaction of the revolutionaries in Yan'an to these articles? As the "Editor's Note" in this issue of the "Literary Gazette" says: "After the above articles were published in Yan'an, they immediately aroused widespread indignation. The cultural and literary circles of Yan'an launched a solemn criticism against these anti-Party remarks." However, these anti-Party elements did not learn a lesson from this serious ideological struggle. In the era of socialist revolution, when the rightists in society took advantage of the Party's rectification to launch a frantic attack on the Party and the cause of socialist revolution, they thought they had an opportunity and formed an anti-Party clique to stage a comeback. It is a pity that, like ants trying to shake a tree, their attack only led to their own failure, and they fell into the mire of rightists. However, people cannot understand the origins and true faces of this group of anti-Party elements all at once. Therefore, re-publishing and re-criticizing are of great significance for deepening the ideological struggle in literary and art circles. The "Editor's Note" particularly emphasizes this significance:

In 1957, the "People's Daily" re-published Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8th." The other articles were not reprinted. "Appreciating strange writings together and analyzing doubts together," many people wanted to read this batch of "strange writings." We collected these things and re-read them all, and indeed there are some strange things. The strangeness lies in writing counter-revolutionary articles in the guise of revolutionaries. Those with a keen sense can see through them at a glance, but others are often deceived. Foreigners who know the names of Ding Ling and Ai Qing may want to understand what is going on. Therefore, we re-published all of these articles.

Thank you for the work of Ding Ling, Wang Shiwei, and others. Poisonous weeds have become fertilizer, and they have become teachers for the vast number of people in our country. They can indeed educate the people to understand how our enemies work. Those whose noses are blocked become clear, and young people or old people who are innocent and ignorant of the world quickly learn many things about the world.

In this issue, along with the publication of these poisonous weeds, articles criticizing them were also published: Lin Mohan's "Wang Shiwei's 'Wild Lily'," Wang Ziye's "You Reap What You Sow" (criticizing "Thoughts on March 8th"), Zhang Guangnian's "Miss Sophie in Yan'an" (criticizing "In the Hospital"), Ma Tieding's "Refuting 'On Comradely 'Love' and 'Endurance'''," Yan Wenjing's "Where Does Luo Feng's 'Short Sword' Point?", and Feng Zhi's "Refuting Ai Qing's 'Understanding Writers, Respecting Writers'." These articles analyzed the environment at the time, powerfully refuted the shameless slander of the Party and the revolutionary base areas by these anti-Party elements, and specifically dissected the souls of these anti-Party elements, all of which help readers recognize their reactionary faces and are worth reading.

This "re-criticism" is one of the signals for the deepening of ideological struggle in literary and art circles in 1958. The "Editor's Note" also said: "We hope that literary and art circles will use this material to publish profound critical articles in literary and art publications in various places to provide more help to readers." This "re-criticism" will surely promote the further development of the great debate on literary and art thought.

In this issue, there is also an article by Chen Bingyi, "On Dudintsev's 'Not by Bread Alone'," which details the distortion of the great socialist reality of the Soviet Union in this novel, and the struggle against revisionist thought in the Soviet literary and art circles surrounding this novel, which is also an article that helps us to carry out the great ideological debate.

From January 1958, the "Literary Gazette" was changed to a semi-monthly publication. In the first issue, "To Our Readers," the editors summarized the work of the "Literary Gazette" during its weekly period last year, and put forward the tasks for 1958. It will focus on literary criticism, and the central task this year is to carry out a great debate on literary and art thought, and criticize revisionist thought in literature and art.

From the first issue after the revision, this feature has already been seen. The first issue of the "Literary Gazette" contains three important articles for carrying out the great debate on literary and art thought: Mao Dun's "Night Reading Notes," Quan Lin's "An Example of Revisionist Literary and Art Thought," and Wang Yao's "On the Understanding of Several Important Issues in Modern Literary History."

Mao Dun's "Night Reading Notes" has not yet been completed by the second issue. Although the author humbly said that this article "is still in the nature of 'notes' and 'talks'," but based on the two parts we have already read, it can be said that this is a systematic essay based on extensive literary knowledge on the development of realistic literature. This essay widely involves the relationship between world outlook and realistic creative methods, the formation and development of Chinese realism, and the debate on socialist realism, which began the year before. In order to clarify the fundamental characteristics of these issues, the author provides us with an overview of the various stages of ancient Chinese literary development, discussing their achievements and characteristics.

Quan Lin's "An Example of Revisionist Literary and Art Thought," although the main target of criticism is Huang Qiuyun's literary and art thought, the nature of the issues it touches on is not limited to Huang Qiuyun's personal social thought and literary and art thought. Huang Qiuyun's touted "artistic conscience," "childlike innocence," or "upright conscience and clear reason," as well as the humanitarian spirit of "feeling the hunger and drowning of others as one's own, and regarding the people as one's own," and the heroic spirit of "defending the truth to the death and rejecting mediocrity and ignorance," were still popular in our literary world not long ago. They are the "sharp spiritual weapons" used by rightists and revisionists to attack our social system and literary and artistic creation. Now that the lid has been lifted, it turns out that these hypocritical tears are all deceptive, discharged from a shell permeated with an individualistic soul. This article historically analyzes these concepts that confuse right and wrong from the basis of two opposing ideological systems, strips off the sugar coating of these thoughts, and dissects the essence of their individualistic world outlook in conjunction with criticizing Huang Qiuyun's literary and art thought.

Wang Yao's "On the Understanding of Several Important Issues in Modern Literary History" is an article criticizing Xue Feng's literary and art thought, focusing on criticizing his "On the Literary and Art Movement of the Democratic Revolution." As everyone knows, Xue Feng's literary and art thought once had a certain market in literary and art circles and among readers. His influence is more prominent in his views on the modern literary movement. Some popular new literary histories have been more or less influenced by Xue Feng's distorted views on the modern literary movement. This anti-Party element, due to his close relationship with Lu Xun, has for many years carried the banner of Lu Xun researcher and carried out activities against the Party's literary and art line. Therefore, clearing his ideological influence will be a central task of this year's great debate on literary and art thought. This article is just a beginning.

In the first issue, there is also a record of "Symposium on Lao She's 'Teahouse'." For new creation reviews, the symposium is a lively form worth adopting, which can quickly collect the opinions of experts and readers. We hope that there will be such symposium records in the publications frequently, which will help to invigorate creation and criticism.

### 奇文共欣赏　毒草成肥料  王实味、丁玲、萧军、罗烽、艾青等文章的再批判  介绍改版后的“文艺报”

    奇文共欣赏　毒草成肥料
    王实味、丁玲、萧军、罗烽、艾青等文章的再批判
    介绍改版后的“文艺报”
    本报讯　刚出版的“文艺报”1958年的第二期有一个“再批判”的特辑，刊登了十五年前在延安“解放日报”的文艺副刊和文艺杂志“谷雨”上发表过的一批反革命的文章：王实味的“野百合花”，丁玲的“三八节有感”和“在医院中”，萧军的“论同志之‘爱’与‘耐’”，罗烽的“还是杂文的时代”，艾青的“了解作家，尊重作家”。
    这些作者的名字对于读者来说，是相当熟悉的。其中有几个，不久以前还拥有名作家的头衔，只是在反右派斗争中，才暴露出他们的本来面目。不了解这些反党分子底细的人，也许会奇怪，这些自称有国际影响的“大作家”、“大诗人”，向来以革命者自居，却为什么会有右派分子的肮脏灵魂呢？不，这绝不是一个偶然的事件。每一个右派分子和反党分子的历史，都是他们自己的一面镜子，只可惜他们一贯地顽固地坚持反党反人民的立场，看不见他们在自己的镜子里的丑态，屡教不改而已。丁玲在南京写过自首书，向蒋介石出卖了无产阶级和共产党。她隐瞒起来，骗得了党的信任，当了“解放日报”文艺副刊的主编。罗烽、艾青在敌人的监狱里也有过自首行为。可是他们不但毫不知罪，反而在此后的若干年中进行了一系列的反党活动。
    1942年，这是革命处于最艰苦的年月。在国际上，希特勒匪帮正在猖狂地进犯苏联，苏联红军还没有转入攻势；在国内，日寇和蒋介石也对革命根据地进行了两面夹攻。当时的陕甘宁边区，就处在国民党反动派的包围封锁下，粮饷断绝，革命队伍的生活发生了极大的困难。党中央和毛主席发出了响亮的号召——自力更生，克服困难，整个边区展开了热火朝天的大生产运动。忠诚的革命者，这时都团结在党中央的周围，奋发有为地在艰苦中锻炼自己，克服困难。而在这样的历史环境里，文艺界的反党分子却利用党和革命人民的困难，配合国内外反动派对革命的“围剿”，对党、对人民展开了反革命的思想攻势。王实味和丁玲用他们的阴暗的眼睛和阴暗的笔，运用杂文和小说等文艺形式，把革命圣地延安描写成漆黑一团，阴森可怖，简直是一个黑暗的封建王国；萧军的“论同志之‘爱’与‘耐’”，艾青的“了解作家，尊重作家”，更从革命的同志关系，革命文艺工作的领导关系上，进行了肆无忌惮的诽谤；而罗烽的“还是杂文的时代”，则起着号召反党的作用，他号召反党分子们起来，用“使人战栗，同时也使人喜悦的短剑”——杂文，来暴露所谓革命的“阴暗面”。这是他们的第一次反党联盟，这个联盟是以文章“讨伐”革命作为他们共同的基调。
    反动派看到了这些反革命文章，真是如获至宝。国民党特务机关在白区把他们的文章当作反共宣传的绝妙材料，给以“义务”出版，大量印发。而对于延安的革命者，这些文章的反应又是怎样呢？正像“文艺报”本期所载“编者按语”中所说的：“上述文章在延安发表以后，立即引起普遍的义愤。延安的文化界和文艺界，针对这些反党言论展开了严正的批判。”可是，这些反党分子，并没有从这次严肃的思想斗争中吸取教训，在社会主义革命时代，正当社会上的右派分子利用党的整风，对党、对社会主义革命事业展开猖狂进攻的时候，他们以为有机可乘，就又结成反党集团卷土重来了。可怜的是，蜉蝣撼大树，他们的进攻只是使他们自己遭到了失败，一直掉进了右派分子的泥坑。但是，人们也不是一下子就能了解这群反党分子的来龙去脉和他们的真面目的。因而，再发表和再批判，对于深入开展文艺思想上的斗争，就有了重大的意义。“编者按语”特别着重地阐明了这种意义：
    一九五七年，“人民日报”重新发表了丁玲的“三八节有感”。其他文章没有重载。“奇文共欣赏，疑义相与析”，许多人想读这一批“奇文”。我们把这些东西搜集起来全部重读一遍，果然有些奇处。奇就奇在以革命者的姿态写反革命的文章。鼻子灵的一眼就能识破，其他的人往往受骗。外国知道丁玲、艾青名字的人也许想要了解这件事的究竟。因此我们重新全部发表了这一批文章。
    谢谢丁玲、王实味等人的劳作，毒草成了肥料，他们成了我国广大人民的教员。他们确能教育人民懂得我们的敌人是如何工作的。鼻子塞了的开通起来，天真烂漫、世事不知的青年人或老年人迅速知道了许多世事。
    在这一期上，和发表这些毒草的同时，还发表了批判它们的文章：林默涵的“王实味的‘野百合花’”，王子野的“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”（批判“三八节有感”），张光年的“莎菲女士在延安”（批判“在医院中”），马铁丁的“斥‘论同志之“爱”与“耐”’”，严文井的“罗烽的‘短剑’指向哪里”，冯至的“驳艾青的‘了解作家，尊重作家’”。这些文章分析了当时的环境，有力地驳斥了这些反党分子对于党、对于革命根据地的无耻诽谤，具体地解剖了这些反党分子的灵魂，都有助于读者认清他们的反动面目，值得大家阅读。
    这个“再批判”，是文艺界1958年深入思想斗争的信号之一。“编者按语”中还说：“我们希望文艺界利用这个材料，在各地的文艺刊物上发表深刻的批评文章，给读者以更多的帮助”。这个“再批判”，一定能推动文艺思想大辩论的进一步开展。
    在这一期上，还有一篇陈冰夷的“关于杜金采夫的‘不只单靠面包’”，文章详细地评述了这部小说歪曲苏联伟大社会主义现实的内容，和苏联文学界围绕着这部小说展开的反对修正主义思想的斗争，这也是一篇有助于我们进行思想大辩论的文章。
    从1958年1月起，“文艺报”改成了半月刊，在第一期“致读者”里，编者总结了去年“文艺报”周刊时期的工作，并提出了1958年的工作任务。它将以文学评论为主要内容，今年的中心任务，则是开展文艺思想大辩论，批判文学上的修正主义思想。
    从改版后的第一期起，已经看到了这一特色。第一期“文艺报”，有三篇进行文艺思想大辩论的重要文章：茅盾的“夜读偶记”，荃麟的“修正主义文艺思想一例”，王瑶的“关于现代文学史上几个重要问题的理解”。
    茅盾的“夜读偶记”，到第二期为止，还没有连载完。虽然作者很谦虚地说：这篇文章“还是‘偶记’和‘漫谈’的性质”，但是，就我们现在已经读过的两部分来看，可以说，这是一篇以渊博的文学知识为基础的系统地论述现实主义文学发展的论文。这篇论文广泛地涉及了从前年就已经开始的世界观与现实主义创作方法的关系，中国现实主义的形成和发展，和社会主义现实主义等问题的争论。为了阐明这些问题的根本特征，作者使我们对中国古代文学发展的各个阶段了解到一个概貌，论述了它们的成就和特色。
    荃麟的“修正主义文艺思想一例”，虽然批判的主要对象是黄秋耘的文艺思想，而它所接触到的问题的性质，却并不局限于黄秋耘个人的社会思想和文艺思想。黄秋耘所标榜的“艺术良心”，“童心”，或者是“正直良心和清明理智”，以及什么“己饥己溺，民胞物与”的人道主义精神，“死守真理，以拒庸愚”的大勇主义精神，不久以前还在我们文坛上流行，它们是右派分子和修正主义者攻击我们的社会制度和文艺创作的“锐利的精神武器”。现在盖子揭开了，原来这些虚伪的眼泪，都是挂羊头卖狗肉，从渗透着个人主义灵魂的躯壳里排泄出来的。这篇文章从两种对立的思想体系的基础上，历史地分析了这些混淆是非的概念，剥掉了这些思想的糖衣，结合着批判黄秋耘的文艺思想，解剖了它们的个人主义世界观的本质。
    王瑶的“关于现代文学史上几个重要问题的理解”，这是一篇批判雪峰文艺思想的文章，重心是批判他的“论民主革命的文艺运动”。大家都知道，雪峰的文艺思想在文艺界和读者中间是曾经有过一定的市场的。他的影响在现代文学运动的见解上更为突出。一些流行的新文学史或多或少地都受过雪峰歪曲现代文学运动见解的影响，这个反党分子，由于和鲁迅有过密切的来往，他多年来挂着鲁迅研究者的招牌，进行了反对党的文艺路线的活动，因此，肃清他的思想影响，将是今年文艺思想大辩论的一个中心。这篇文章仅仅是一个开始。
    在第一期，还有“座谈老舍的‘茶馆’”的一个纪录，对于新的创作的评论，座谈是一种值得采用的活泼的形式，它能够迅速地搜集专家和读者的意见。我们希望刊物上经常能有这样的座谈记录，这会有助于创作和评论的活跃。
