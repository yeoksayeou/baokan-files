    Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference Declaration –
    A Letter to the People of the World
    We, the Asian-African people, met in Cairo from December 26, 1957, to January 1, 1958, to discuss international issues of particular concern to the Asian-African people.
    We explored the various political, economic, social, and cultural problems facing the Asian-African people.
    The only sentiment that motivated us was the cooperation and solidarity between our people, and perfect friendship with the people of all countries in the world.
    After seven days of harmonious discussions, our conference has reached a unanimous agreement on suggestions for resolving various problems. This proves that the Asian-African people have reached a higher degree of unity in the task of supporting peace, and have reached the point of having a common program of action. The conference unanimously agreed to establish a permanent organization in Cairo to promote the implementation of the conference resolutions.
    We declare that the principles adopted by the Bandung Conference in April 1955 should still be the basis of international relations. We reaffirm our absolute support for the following ten principles, which have been supported by our people in the past few years:
    (1) Respect for fundamental human rights, and for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
    (2) Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.
    (3) Recognition of the equality of all races, and the equality of all nations, large and small.
    (4) Non-interference or intervention in the internal affairs of another country.
    (5) Respect for the right of each nation to defend itself, either individually or collectively, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
    (6) Zi, not to use arrangements of collective defence to serve the particular interests of any of the big Powers.
    Chou, no country should exert pressure on other countries.
    (7) Abstention from acts or threats of aggression or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country.
    (8) Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement as well as other peaceful means of their own choice, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
    (9) Promotion of mutual interests and cooperation.
    (10) Respect for justice and international obligations.
    We firmly believe that if these ten principles are accepted, the current world tension will certainly be eased, and the great fear of destruction that now fills the hearts of billions of people can be dispelled.
    We declare that unless we eliminate this tension, the foundation of peace cannot be firmly established. We welcome every step taken in this regard. We call upon the people of the world to make the most of every possible means to create a scope for agreement and understanding, which will inevitably lead to disarmament, and the prohibition of the production, testing and use of nuclear weapons. We call upon the people of the world to use their scientific efforts and nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and for the service of mankind, and to achieve prosperity and full cooperation between all peoples on the basis of equality in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
    The Asian-African people believe in the Charter of the United Nations.
    The Asian-African people believe that the rule of imperialism, foreign exploitation, and other evils caused by the conquest of people, in addition to causing harmful consequences to the development of peace and international cooperation for both the government and the governed, are also a denial of basic human rights and a violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The continued existence of imperialism is incompatible with the new era in which the world is now situated. The Asian-African people firmly believe in the right of every nation to strive for freedom and independence.
    The Asian-African people hope to unite, work together, and help each other, in order to struggle for the happiness of the Asian-African people and the entire human race. We will spare no effort to strive for the realization of lasting world peace.
    Peace must triumph.
    Humanity can look forward to the future with hope and confidence. This is the New Year's message from the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo to the whole world.

    亚非人民团结大会宣言——
    告世界人民书
    我们亚非人民在1957年12月26日至1958年1月1日在开罗举行会议，讨论了特别同亚非人民有关的国际问题。
    我们探讨了亚非人民所面临的各种政治、经济、社会和文化问题。
    激励着我们的唯一的感情是我们人民之间的合作和团结，以及同世界各国人民的完满友谊。
    在七天融洽的讨论以后，我们的大会已经就解决各种问题的建议达成了一致的协议。这证明，亚非人民在支持和平的任务中已经达到了更高度的团结，而且已经达到了有共同的行动纲领的地步。大会一致同意在开罗设立常设组织，以促进大会决议的实现。
    我们宣布，1955年4月万隆会议所通过的原则仍然应当是国际关系的基础。我们重申，我们绝对支持在过去几年中受到我们的人民支持的下列十项原则：
    （一）尊重基本人权，尊重联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。
    （二）尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整。
    （三）承认一切种族的平等，承认一切大小国家的平等。
    （四）不干预或干涉他国内政。
    （五）尊重每一个国家按照联合国宪章单独地或集体地进行自卫的权利。
    （六）子、不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务。
    丑、任何国家不对其他国家施加压力。
    （七）不以侵略行为或侵略威胁或使用武力来侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。
    （八）按照联合国宪章，通过如谈判、调停、仲裁、司法解决等和平方法以及有关方面自己选择的任何其他和平方法来解决一切国际争端。
    （九）促进相互的利益和合作。
    （十）尊重正义和国际义务。
    我们完全相信，如果这十项原则被接受，目前的世界紧张局势将肯定会得到缓和，现在亿万人民心胸中所充满的对毁灭的极大恐惧将能够得以解除。
    我们宣布，除非我们消除这种紧张局势，和平的基础将不能坚固地建立起来。我们欢迎在这方面所采取的每一个步骤。我们号召世界人民尽量利用每一种可能的办法来创造协议和谅解的范围，这样做必然会引向裁军，禁止生产、试验和使用核武器。我们号召世界人民把他们的科学努力和核能用于和平目的和为人类服务，以及根据联合国宪章在平等的基础上来实现各国人民之间的繁荣和完全合作。
    亚非人民相信联合国宪章。
    亚非人民认为，帝国主义的统治、外国的剥削和由于征服人民而造成的其他的罪恶，除了对政府和被统治者都造成妨碍和平和国际合作的发展的有害结果外，还是对人类基本权利的否定和对联合国宪章的违反。帝国主义的继续存在和现在世界所处的新时代是不相容的。亚非人民坚决相信每个民族的争取自由和独立的权利。
    亚非人民希望团结起来，共同努力，互相帮助，以便为亚非人民和整个人类的幸福而斗争。我们将不遗余力地为实现世界的持久和平而奋斗。
    和平必定胜利。
    人类能够满怀希望和信心展望未来。这就是在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会向全世界的新年祝词。
