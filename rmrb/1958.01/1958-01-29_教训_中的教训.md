The Lesson in "Lesson"
Hui Zhi

In 1956, Shanxi Province vigorously promoted the high-yield crop "Golden Queen" corn, increasing the province's corn planting area from 6.2 million mu in 1955 to 9.16 million mu. However, while this corn was still growing, the rumor that "Golden Queen will not tassel" suddenly spread throughout the province, and it was said to be a "profound lesson." Because of this "lesson," the corn planting area in the province in 1957 returned to the original 6 million mu. At the same time, other effective measures to increase production were also met with indifference.

The facts have now been clarified: most of the corn planted in Shanxi in 1956 did increase production, yielding a total of more than 270 million jin of grain. Due to sudden changes in the weather, poor field management, and untimely post-processing, only about 200,000 mu, or about 2% of the total area, failed to tassel or produce kernels, resulting in a reduction of more than 20 million jin of grain. After offsetting the increase and decrease, there was still an increase of 250 million jin of grain. Obviously, the achievements are the main aspect.

This fact shows that the statement of the responsible comrade of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture is correct. He said: "Every success or failure case in agricultural technology reform must be analyzed comprehensively and realistically. We must not be preconceived, let alone deny everything upon discovering shortcomings, and eliminate what is correct along with correcting deviations." In fact, no movement can be without any problems, unless there is no movement, no progress. The correct attitude is to use proper methods to correct these problems and make the movement develop healthily. Ignoring these problems and not finding ways to overcome them is wrong, because this will hinder the development of the movement. However, exaggerating the problems, denying everything upon discovering a few shortcomings, and overturning the overall situation is even more wrong. Because this is not guiding the healthy development of the movement, but fundamentally canceling the movement. If a person has ten fingers and one of them is diseased, the correct approach is to cure the finger, not to cut off the other nine fingers as well.

The emergence and development of all new things always experiences some twists and turns and obstacles. Agricultural production is largely restricted and affected by natural conditions, and even the best measures to increase production will have some failures. Moreover, the peasants have just left the circle of small-scale farming, and there are still many conservative ideas, which determines that the promotion of certain new technologies and measures will encounter resistance from conservative tendencies and will not be smooth sailing. The responsibility of revolutionaries is to wage unremitting struggles against conservative tendencies, persuade the vast number of cadres and the masses, and change their thinking to promote the growth of new things. The leaders of every unit must act as helmsmen, maintain calmness and composure when the storm rises, and grasp the correct direction; they should not drift with the tide, parrot others, and easily change course without investigation and research. Some comrades in Shanxi Province did not do this in the work of promoting "Golden Queen" corn. They swayed in a chorus of clamor, resulting in losses. This is the lesson that people should learn from the "Golden Queen incident."

    “教训”中的教训
    慧之
    山西省在1956年曾经大量推广高产作物金皇后玉米，使全省玉米播种面积从1955年的六百二十万亩扩大到九百一十六万亩。但是，当这些玉米还正在成长的时候，“金皇后不出穗”的说法忽然传遍了全省，并且说这是“沉痛的教训”。由于这次“教训”，1957年全省的玉米播种面积又回到了原来的六百多万亩。与此同时，其他一些行之有效的增产措施也遭到了冷漠的待遇。
    事实现在已经澄清，1956年山西所种玉米绝大部分都增了产，共约多收二亿七千多万斤粮食。由于天气突然变化，田间管理不善，后期加工不及时，以致不出穗或不结籽而造成减产的，只有二十多万亩，约占总面积的2％，少收粮二千多万斤。增减相抵，还多收粮二亿五千万斤。很明显，成绩是主要的。
    这事实说明山西省农业建设厅负责同志的说法是正确的。他说：“对农业技术改革上每一个成败事例，都必须全面地、实事求是地分析。千万不能先入为主，更不能发现缺点，就一概否定，在纠正偏差当中，把本来是对的东西也一齐纠掉了。”事实上，任何一种运动都不可能一点毛病不出，除非不运动，不前进。正确的态度，就是要用妥善的方法来纠正这些毛病，使运动健康地发展。不理会这些毛病、不想办法来克服，是不对的，因为这会妨害运动的发展。但是，夸大毛病，发现一点缺点就否定一切，推翻全面，尤其不对。因为这不是引导运动健康发展，而是把运动根本取消了。人有十个指头，其中一个指头害了病，正确的作法是治好这个指头，而不是连其余九个指头都砍了。
    一切新事物的产生和发展，总要经历一些波折和阻难的。农业生产在很大程度上受着自然条件的限制和影响，再好的增产措施也会有一部分失利的。而农民又是刚刚离开小农经济的圈圈，守旧思想还很多，这就注定某些新技术、新措施的推行，要遭到保守倾向的抵制，不能一帆风顺。革命者的责任，就是要同保守倾向作不懈的斗争，说服广大干部和群众，使他们改变思想，以促进新生事物的成长。每一个单位的领导者都要起舵手作用，在风浪起来时，保持冷静和沉着，掌握住正确的方向；而不应随波逐流，人云亦云，不加调查研究就轻易转舵。山西省有些同志在推广“金皇后”玉米的工作中没有这样做，他们在一片叫嚷声中摇晃起来，结果造成了损失，这就是人们应该从“金皇后事件”中吸取的教训。
