The answers to yesterday's "Math Game" are Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows how to cut the shape: cut once from Chou to Shen, and then again from Shen to Si, dividing the paper shape into three pieces: A, B, and C. Figure 2 shows how to piece them together: connect the Zi-Chou and Chou-Yin of triangle B (the same as C), which was cut from Chou to Shen, with Zi-You and Yin-Mao; then connect the Shen-Wei of triangle C, which was cut from Shen to Si, with You-Shen of triangle B, and Wei-Si with Mao-Si. This creates a square.

The method for this game can be discovered through experimentation; however, if we know the Pythagorean theorem in geometry, it becomes easier to do.

    数学游戏答案
    图一和图二就是昨天“数学游戏”的答案。图一是它的剪法，即从丑——申剪一刀，再从申——巳剪一刀，把纸形分成甲、乙、丙三块。图二是它的拼法，即把从丑——申剪下来的三角形乙（与丙同）的子——丑与丑——寅，子——酉与寅——卯拼连一起；再把从申——巳剪下来的三角形丙的申——未与三角形乙的酉——申，未——巳与卯——巳拼连一起。这样就成为一个正方形了。
    这个游戏的作法，可以从实验中得到；但是，如果我们知道几何学上的“勾股定理”，作起来就比较容易了。
