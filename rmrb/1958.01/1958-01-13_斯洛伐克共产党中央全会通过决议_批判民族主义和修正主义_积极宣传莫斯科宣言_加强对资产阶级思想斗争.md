Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 11th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported that the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party held a meeting in Bratislava from January 9th to 10th. The meeting discussed the conclusions of the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, in the spirit of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's resolution of December 20, 1957, and discussed the main ideological problems facing the Slovak Communist Party and the tasks stipulated by the June meeting of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee last year.

    V. Bačilek, member of the Political Bureau of the CPCz Central Committee and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party, made a report on these issues. The Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party passed a resolution on this report, deciding to convene the Slovak Communist Party Congress from May 16th to 18th, 1958.

    In this resolution, the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party expressed its complete agreement with the conclusions adopted by the CPCz Central Committee on the results of the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The resolution stated that, as seen from the Moscow talks, from the meetings held by the CPCz Central Committee in June and December 1957, and from the experience of our Slovak Party work, the following ideological issues have become the most important today: to educate our people in the spirit of Czechoslovak socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism; to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in our republic; at the same time, to fight against bourgeois ideology, we must lead this struggle more consistently and specifically than before, especially the struggle against bourgeois nationalism and revisionism.

    The resolution stated that the Slovak working people have repeatedly shown in their history that they consider the Czechoslovak Republic as the only natural and legitimate national unit; the Czechs and Slovaks living in a common country is the long-standing desire of the Czech and Slovak working people.

    The resolution stated that experience shows that one of the greatest dangers to socialist construction in Czechoslovakia today is the remnants of Slovak bourgeois nationalism. In the ideological sphere, the important task facing the Slovak Communist Party today is to strengthen and persistently lead an effective ideological struggle, especially against the influence of fascist-clericals and any manifestations of bourgeois nationalism.

    The resolution then mentioned the main tasks of the Slovak Communist Party in ideological work: to explain the propositions in the Declaration and the Peace Manifesto through all propaganda tools, to strengthen fraternal relations with the Soviet Union, to explain the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the international communist and workers' movement, to educate the people to feel proud of belonging to the socialist camp and to hate imperialism, to mobilize the people to actively participate in the struggle for peace, to take responsibility for the victorious construction of socialism in Czechoslovakia, to strengthen their unity, and to resolutely support the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

    斯洛伐克共产党中央全会通过决议
    批判民族主义和修正主义
    积极宣传莫斯科宣言　加强对资产阶级思想斗争
    新华社布拉格11日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会于1月9日到10日在布拉迪斯拉发举行了会议。会议根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会1957年12月20日的决议的精神讨论了各国共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议的结论，并且讨论了斯洛伐克共产党面临的主要意识形态问题和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会去年6月的会议所规定的任务。
    捷共中央政治局委员、斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记巴契列克作了关于这些问题的报告。斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会就这个报告通过了一个决议，决定在1958年5月16日到18日召开斯洛伐克共产党代表大会。
    在这个决议中，斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会表示完全同意捷共中央对各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的结果所通过的结论。决议说，从莫斯科会谈看来以及从捷共中央1957年6月和12月所举行的会议看来和从我们斯洛伐克党工作的经验看来，下列这些思想意识上的问题今天成了最重要的问题：以捷克斯洛伐克社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神来教育我们的人民；加强我们共和国各族人民的团结；与此同时对资产阶级思想进行斗争，我们必须比以前更加一致而具体地领导这种斗争，特别是对资产阶级民族主义和修正主义的斗争。
    决议说，斯洛伐克劳动人民已经多次在他们的历史上表明：他们认为捷克斯洛伐克共和国是唯一自然和合法的国家单位；捷克人和斯洛伐克人生活在一个共同的国家内——这是捷克和斯洛伐克劳动人民亘古以来的愿望。
    决议说，经验表明，今天捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的最大危险之一是斯洛伐克资产阶级民族主义的残余。在思想意识领域中，斯洛伐克共产党今天面临着的重要任务是加强和坚持不懈地领导有效的思想意识斗争、特别是反对法西斯分子——牧师的影响以及资产阶级民族主义的任何表现的斗争。
    决议接着提到斯洛伐克共产党在思想意识工作方面的主要任务：要通过一切宣传工具来解释宣言与和平宣言中的主张，加强同苏联的兄弟般的关系，解释苏联共产党在国际共产主义和工人运动中的领导作用，教育人民使他们以属于社会主义阵营而感到自豪和痛恨帝国主义，动员人民积极参加争取和平的斗争，担负起在捷克斯洛伐克胜利建设社会主义的责任，加强他们的团结和坚决拥护捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会。
