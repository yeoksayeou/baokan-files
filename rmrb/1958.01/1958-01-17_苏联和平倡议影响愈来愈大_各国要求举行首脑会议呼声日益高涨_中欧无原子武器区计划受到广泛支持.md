Xinhua News Agency Report: The Soviet government's proposals for easing international tensions have had an increasingly strong impact in countries around the world. Public figures and celebrities in various countries, including some government leaders, have expressed support for suggestions regarding the convening of East-West summit talks and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

    German Communist Party First Secretary Points Out that the Time is Ripe for a Summit
    The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Reimann, stated on the evening of the 14th, regarding the Soviet peace initiatives and the situation in West Germany, that the idea of East-West understanding is now taking root more and more deeply in the broad population of West Germany. The current situation in West Germany is marked by: the rising chorus of opposition to nuclear armament and the establishment of missile bases in West Germany, a chorus that has spread from the working class to bourgeois figures; and the increasingly loud calls for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Reimann pointed out that the time is ripe for convening the summit meeting of East and West governments as proposed by the Soviet Union. However, the Adenauer government deliberately says that it must first explore the intentions of the Soviet government through diplomatic channels, and disagrees with the suggestion of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.
    Austrian Communist Party Chairman Says Arms Race and Cold War Must End
    The Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, Koplenig, said to a reporter from the "People's Voice" regarding the Soviet peace initiatives: "Any action to strive for peace and East-West mutual understanding will now receive broad sympathy throughout the world, because the majority of people have realized that the arms race and the Cold War must end." Koplenig said: "Peace-loving people, especially the working people, expect the Austrian government to express its willingness to participate in and promote the preparatory work for a meeting of national leaders in its reply to the Soviet government."
    Danish Prime Minister Supports the Establishment of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Europe
    Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen supports the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He suggested that this issue be discussed during East-West talks.
    Hansen made the above statement in an interview with the pacifist "Peace and Freedom Report." He said: "The plan proposed by Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki is noteworthy and should be studied as a measure to help strengthen peace."
    Faure Says Soviet Proposals Contain Nothing Unreasonable
    Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure pointed out in an interview with "Le Monde" that "obviously, we should enter a new phase of East-West negotiations."
    Faure said: "It seems that the Soviet proposals contain nothing unreasonable... However, if the formula of the proposals does not completely suit us, we must propose another formula. We should never refuse negotiations, but strive to begin negotiations."
        Western European Public Opinion Supports Soviet Proposals
    Many Italian newspapers are interested in the letters from Bulganin to Italian Prime Minister Zoli. Turin's "La Stampa" wrote: "No one can deny that partial disarmament measures (atomic or conventional armaments) are beneficial and possible, because such measures will at least ease tensions." The newspaper supports the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. An editorial in "Avanti!" refuted the slander by some bourgeois newspapers that Bulganin's letters were merely "propaganda." The newspaper said: "True, this is propaganda, but it is propaganda for peace, and its purpose is to mobilize public opinion and remind governments not to forget their responsibilities..."
    Belgian Catholic Senator Struye published an article in "La Libre Belgique" stating: Refusing to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the pretext of mutual distrust indicates pursuing a policy without vision. He condemned Western countries for prematurely rejecting proposals made by socialist countries.
    The Soviet peace proposals have been warmly welcomed by Greek public opinion. "Avgi" said: Bulganin's letter to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis was written in a friendly tone. It emphasized the role that Greece could play in establishing a peaceful region. The pro-government newspaper "Kathimerini" also believed that "accepting and implementing the specific Soviet proposals would undoubtedly lead to an improvement in the international situation."
    Western European Parliamentarians Tend to Favor Immediate Talks Between the West and the Soviet Union
    Agence France-Presse reported from Strasbourg: "The Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, with parliamentarians from fifteen countries participating, displayed a clear tendency in the debates on the 15th to favor immediate talks with the Soviet Union." The report said: "Most speakers emphasized that 'the time is ripe to study the proposal of Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki'." Belgian Socialist Rollin said that holding a meeting between Secretary of State Dulles and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko before holding high-level talks is "of no benefit."

    苏联和平倡议影响愈来愈大
    各国要求举行首脑会议呼声日益高涨
    中欧无原子武器区计划受到广泛支持
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议，在世界各国发生了日益强烈的影响。世界各国公众和社会名流，包括一些国家的政府领袖，都表示支持关于召开东西方最高级会谈和建立中欧无原子地区等建议。
    德共第一书记指出首脑会议时机成熟
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼14日晚间就苏联的和平倡议和西德形势发表谈话说，东西方谅解的思想现在在西德的广大居民中越来越深入人心。目前西德形势的标志是：拒绝进行原子武装和在西德建立火箭基地的呼声日益高涨，这种呼声已经由工人阶级一直扩展到资产阶级人士中间；要求建立中欧无原子武器地区的呼声也越来越响亮。雷曼指出，召开苏联所建议的东西方各国政府首脑会议的时机已经成熟。但是阿登纳政府还故意说要首先通过外交途径来摸一下苏联政府的意图，并且不同意在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。
    奥共主席说必须结束军备竞赛和冷战
    奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希就苏联的和平倡议对“人民之声报”记者发表谈话说：“任何争取和平和东西方互相谅解的行动，现在都会在全世界获得广泛的同情，因为大多数人民已经意识到必须结束军备竞赛和冷战。”柯普勒尼希说：“爱好和平的人们，特别是劳动人民，都期望奥地利政府在给苏联政府的答复中表示愿意参加和促进国家领导人会议的筹备工作。”
  丹麦首相支持建立中欧无原子武器地区
    丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森支持在中欧建立无原子武器地区的计划。他建议在东西方会谈过程中讨论这个问题。
    汉森在对和平主义的“和平与自由报”发表谈话时作了上述声明。他说：“波兰外交部长腊帕茨基提出的计划值得注意，应当把它作为有助于加强和平的措施而加以研究。”
  富尔说苏联建议没有任何不合理的地方
    法国前总理埃加·富尔在对“世界报”发表的谈话中指出，“显然，我们应当进入东西方谈判的新阶段”。
    富尔说：“看来，苏联的建议没有任何不合理的地方……但是，如果建议的公式不完全适合我们，我们必须提出另外的公式。无论什么时候我们都不应当拒绝谈判，而应当争取开始谈判。”
        西欧舆论支持苏联建议
    意大利许多报纸都对布尔加宁给意大利总理佐利的信件感到兴趣。都灵“邮报”写道：“谁也不能否认，局部裁军措施（原子军备或常规军备）是有益的，而且是可能的，因为这种措施至少会缓和紧张局势。”报纸支持关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议。“前进报”发表的一篇社论驳斥了某些资产阶级报纸硬说布尔加宁的信件只不过是“宣传”的谰言。这家报纸说：“不错，这是宣传，但这是在宣传和平，它的目的是发动舆论和提醒各国政府不要忘掉它们的责任……”
    比利时天主教参议员斯特律耶在“自由比利时报”发表文章说：借口互不信任而拒绝同苏联谈判，就表示在奉行没有远见的政策。他谴责西方国家过早地表示拒绝社会主义国家提出的建议。
    苏联的和平建议受到希腊舆论的热烈欢迎。“黎明日报”说：布尔加宁给希腊首相卡拉曼利斯的信是用友好的口吻写成的。它着重指出了希腊在建立和平地区方面可能起的作用。接近官方的报纸“每日新闻”也认为：“接受和实现苏联的具体建议无疑会导致国际局势的改善。”
    西欧各国议员倾向西方立即同苏联会谈
    法新社从斯特拉斯堡发出的一条消息说：有十五国议会议员参加的欧洲委员会谘询议会在“15日的辩论中显示出赞成立即同苏联会谈的明显倾向。”消息说：大部分发言者都强调指出，“研究波兰外交部长腊帕茨基的建议的时机已经成熟”。比利时社会党人罗林说，要在举行高级会谈以前先举行国务卿杜勒斯和苏联外交部长葛　罗米柯之间的会议是“没有好处”的。
