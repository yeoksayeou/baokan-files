Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. Mr. Willing, the defense attorney for John William Powell, former editor of the Shanghai China Weekly Review, arrived in Guangzhou yesterday from Hong Kong and will proceed to Beijing.

The American authorities filed charges against Powell a year and a half ago for "sedition" because he had reported and denounced American acts of aggression and germ warfare, among other crimes, in the China Weekly Review during the Korean War. His wife and former China Weekly Review assistant editor, Julian Schuman, were also charged with the same "crime".

The U.S. court in San Francisco that is hearing Powell's case sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China on September 3, 1957, requesting judicial assistance. Since there is no agreement on judicial assistance between the Chinese and American governments, the Chinese Ministry of Justice had to return the "Request for Judicial Assistance" to the American court. On December 12, 1957, at the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Geneva, the Chinese representative, Ambassador Wang Bingnan, suggested that the Chinese and American governments hold negotiations in order to reach an agreement on judicial assistance on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. However, the American side rejected this suggestion.

Mr. Willing has come to China in a situation where the U.S. government has refused to reach an agreement with the Chinese government on judicial assistance. Therefore, it is understood that the Chinese court will not be able to preside over his meetings with Chinese witnesses and the collection of evidence. After arriving in Beijing, Willing will contact Tang Mingzhao, a friend of Powell and the vice chairman of the Committee in Support of Powell.

    鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林抵广州
    新华社广州7日电　前上海密勒氏评论报主笔鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林先生昨天由香港到达广州，并将前往北京。
    美国当局在一年半以前以“煽动叛乱”罪对鲍惠尔提出了控诉，因为他曾经在朝鲜战争期间在密勒氏评论报上报道和指责美国进行侵略战争和细菌战等罪行。以同样“罪名”被控诉的还有他的妻子和前密勒氏评论报助理编辑舒曼。
    审理鲍惠尔案件的美国旧金山法院曾在1957年9月3日致函中华人民共和国司法部要求予以司法协助。由于中美两国政府之间没有关于司法协助的协议，中国司法部不得不把“司法协助请求书”退回美国法院。1957年12月12日在日内瓦中美大使级会谈上，中国代表王炳南大使曾建议中美两国政府举行谈判，以便在平等互惠基础上就司法协助问题达成协议。但是，美国方面拒绝了这个建议。
    威林先生是在美国政府拒绝就司法协助问题同中国政府达成协议的情形下来到中国的。因此，据悉中国法院将无法主持他会见中国证人和搜集证据的事。威林到北京后，将与鲍惠尔的朋友、声援鲍惠尔委员会副主席唐明照接触。
