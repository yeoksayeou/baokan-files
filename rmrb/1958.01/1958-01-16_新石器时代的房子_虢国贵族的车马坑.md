The Yellow River Reservoir Archaeological Team, jointly formed by the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture, which began archaeological excavations near Shan County and Sanmenxia City in Henan Province in 1956, continued to make rich gains in the first half of 1957. The main achievements in the first half of 1957 are as follows:

The total excavated area of the Miaodigou Neolithic site reached 4,489 square meters. Three Yangshao houses and 190 ash pits were unearthed; one Longshan house, one kiln, and 26 ash pits; 172 tombs from the Neolithic period to the Han and Tang dynasties. Pottery is the most abundant artifact found here, with more than 500 pieces restored.

The Yangshao culture houses are square or rectangular shallow pit dwellings, with the entrance facing south. Near the entrance, there is a stove pit. The foundations of the houses have four stone plinths arranged in a square, and there are vertical or inclined post holes around the walls, with as many as thirty or forty remaining post holes. Another type is a round house with a smaller diameter, with only one post hole in the center, possibly a conical shed. The artifacts include abundant painted pottery. Stone tools are mainly chipped stone tools, but there are also well-polished stone plows.

The Longshan culture houses are round pit dwellings with stepped entrances on the east side. There is a post hole in the center of the house foundation, and there are small, inclined post holes around the walls. The living surface and steps are covered with white lime. Among the pottery, there is no wheel-made pottery, the patterns are mainly cord patterns, there is a lack of typical black pottery, there are many pottery "jia" (tripod pitchers), but no pottery "li" (tripod cooking pots). The pottery cups are coated with red slip, very similar to painted pottery. The number of polished stone tools and bone tools is relatively large, and traces of wooden "lei" (digging sticks) have also been found. From the perspective of cultural nature, it is very different from the Longshan culture in Henan Province. It may belong to an earlier period.

The Yangshao artifacts at the Sanliqiao site are similar to those at Miaodigou, but the amount of painted pottery is small, and the patterns are relatively simple. The Longshan artifacts basically belong to the scope of the Henan Longshan culture, with wheel-made pottery and typical black pottery, the patterns are mainly cord patterns, the shape of the vessels is more "li" and less "jia," and the "gui" (ewer) also appears. This site is across the river from Miaodigou and is very different in cultural nature, which may represent a difference in time.

A total of 166 Eastern Zhou tombs and four chariot and horse pits were excavated at the Shangcunling cemetery. This is a fairly well-preserved cemetery, and the burial objects are also very rich. More than 600 pieces of bronze ware were unearthed, and there are inscriptions on the "ge" (halberd) such as "Guo Daizi Yuan Tu Ge" (Halberd of Yuan Tu, the Crown Prince of Guo), and there are also six containers with inscriptions such as "Guo Ji Shi Zi □" (Child of the Guo Ji Clan) and "Guo Jin Shi Sun" (Grandson of the Guo Jin Clan). There are more than 400 pieces of pottery, as well as lacquerware, jade ware, bone ware, and shells.

The chariot and horse pit of the tomb of "Guo Daizi Yuan Tu" has ten chariots and twenty horses. The other two tombs have five chariots and ten horses, and one tomb has only two horses. The traces of the chariots are very well preserved, which is an important material for studying the chariot system in the early Spring and Autumn period.

More than fifty tombs have been excavated at the Houchuan cemetery, and there have been unusually rich discoveries. Large-scale excavations are currently underway.

More than 580 pieces of bronze ware were found in a large tomb, including a large "ding" (cauldron) with a diameter of 0.8 meters, a bronze "ge" with a gold-inlaid inscription "Zi Kong Ze Jue Ji Jin Zhu Qi Yuan Yong" (Zi Kong chose auspicious bronze to cast it for his primary use), and an iron sword with a gold-plated wax head. In addition, there are many exquisite bronzes in other tombs.

The Houchuan cemetery includes tombs from the late Spring and Autumn period to the early Western Han Dynasty, as well as the Han and Tang Dynasties, with the early Western Han Dynasty being the most important. These tombs provide a lot of valuable information for understanding the material culture life and the evolution of tombs from the Eastern Zhou to the early Han Dynasty.

More than twenty tombs have been cleared at the Xincheng cemetery, mainly Tang tombs. Tang tombs are mainly porcelain, including bottles, pots, cups, water pitchers, etc. In the tomb of the sixth year of Dazhong (852 AD), in addition to porcelain containers, there were white porcelain ox carts with sauce glaze, prostrate figurines, small horse-riding figurines, sheep, monkeys, and other toys.

The problem of dating Tang porcelain was solved based on the coexisting epitaphs, and it was also known that porcelain was more prevalent in late Tang tombs.

    新石器时代的房子
    虢国贵族的车马坑
    从1956年起便在河南陕县和三门峡市附近展开考古发掘工作的科学院和文化部联合组成的黄河水库考古工作队，1957年上半年继续获得丰富的收获。1957年上半年主要的收获有下面几项。
    庙底沟新石器时代遗址发掘总面积达四千四百八十九平方公尺。出土仰韶房子三座，灰坑一百九十个；龙山房子一座，窑一座，灰坑二十六个；新石器时代到汉唐的墓葬一百七十二座。这里的遗物以陶器最为丰富，共复原了五百多件。
    仰韶文化的房子是方形或长方形的浅竖穴，门口向南，近门处有一灶坑，屋基中有排列成方形的四个石柱础，周围墙上有直的或斜的柱洞，残存的柱洞达三四十个。另外一种是圆形的房子，直径较小，只在中央有一个柱洞，可能是一座尖锥顶的棚子。遗物中彩陶丰富。石器中以打制石器为主，但也有磨制很好的石犁。
    龙山文化的房子是圆形竖穴，在东面有台阶式的入口，屋基中央有一柱洞，周围墙上有斜的小柱洞，居住面和台阶上都涂有白灰面。在陶器中不见轮制的，花纹以蓝纹为主，缺乏典型的黑陶，陶斝很多，但不见陶鬲。在陶杯上涂有红色陶衣，很像彩陶。磨制石器和骨器的数量较多，还发现了木耒的痕迹。从文化性质上来看，和河南省的龙山文化有着很大的差别。可能是属于早期。
    三里桥遗址的仰韶遗物和庙底沟相似，但彩陶数量很少，花纹也比较简单。龙山遗物基本上属于河南龙山文化的范畴，有轮制陶器和典型的黑陶，花纹以绳纹为主，器形是鬲多而斝少，同时还有鬶的出现。这个遗址和庙底沟隔河相对，在文化性质上迥然不同，可能代表有时代上的差别。
    上村岭墓地共发掘了东周墓一百六十六座，车马坑四座。这是保存相当完整的一个墓地，随葬器物也非常丰富，出土铜器共达六百余件，在戈上有“虢大子元徒戈”的铭文，还有六件容器有铭文，有“虢季氏子□”、“虢金氏孙”等铭文。陶器有四百多件，还有漆器、玉器、骨器和贝等。
    “虢大子元徒”墓的车马坑有车十辆，马二十匹，其他两座墓是五辆车，十匹马，也有一座墓仅有二匹马。车的痕迹保存得极好，这是研究春秋初期车制的重要资料。
    后川墓地已发掘了五十余座墓葬，有异常丰富的发现，目前正在大规模的发掘。
    在一座大墓中发现铜器五百八十余件，有口径达零点八公尺的大鼎，带有“子孔择厥吉金铸其元用”的错金铭文的铜戈，还有附金质腊、首的铁剑。另外，在其他墓中也有不少精美的铜器。
    后川墓地包括了春秋末期到西汉初期以及汉、唐等时期的墓葬，其中以西汉初期最为重要。这些墓葬对了解东周至汉初的物质文化生活和墓葬演变过程等情况提供了许多宝贵的资料。
    新城墓地已清理了二十余座墓葬，主要都是唐墓。唐墓中以瓷器为主，有瓶、壶、杯、水注等，在大中六年的墓中，除瓷制的容器以外，有白瓷挂酱釉的牛车、匍匐俑、骑马小俑、羊、猴等玩具。
    根据共存墓志解决了唐瓷的断代问题，同时也知道在晚唐墓葬中，瓷器是比较盛行的。
