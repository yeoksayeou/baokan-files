This is Wasteful?

Editor's Note: The letter from Comrade Huang Xiuying entitled "Is This Wasteful?" published on the "Mailbox" column of the supplement on the 5th has already attracted the attention of the majority of readers. In the past three days, we have received 218 contributions to the discussion.

The discussion on this issue will be published in the supplement every Thursday and Sunday. The discussion time is initially planned for about a month. You are welcome to relate your own thoughts and experiences in life and express your opinions on this issue.

Improving Life Should Not Be Willful

Our country is a large country, but also a poor country. To build socialism, we need a lot of money. Where does this money come from? Mainly from everyone's diligence and thrift. Factories need to be diligent and thrifty, and so does daily life. Therefore, the Party has put forward the call for building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the household diligently and thriftily.

The reason why Comrade Huang Xiuying cannot accept the criticism from the Party小组 (small group) meeting is that she has considered the difficulties of national construction too little, and she is only thinking about the improvement of personal life everywhere.

If you have an old cotton-padded coat, you should not buy a short coat. If it is old, it can be dismantled, washed, or altered. This saves the country cotton cloth and saves money for yourself. Flannel shirts are also woven from cotton yarn. Those who can do without buying them should try not to buy them and leave those flannel shirts for those who need them most. Because our country's cotton production still cannot keep up with the demand!

Of course, you can dispose of the money you earn through your own labor yourself. However, I think it is better to spend it one day later than one day earlier. Saving it in the bank for one more day means supporting national construction for one more day. As for personal birth, old age, sickness, and death, you should try to bear it yourself and not rely on the commune to take care of it. If the commune members have difficulties and wait for the commune to take care of them, can the commune take care of them? Can the commune still accumulate funds? Without funds, how can we develop production? If production cannot be developed, can the lives of the commune members still be improved?

The Party and Chairman Mao are very concerned about the lives of the people. Our lives are getting better day by day. However, improving life must never disregard the state of national production development and the difficulties in construction!

I am a cadre of a handicraft cooperative, and my wife is a member. The average monthly income for both of us is more than seventy yuan. Our cotton clothes usually last for four or five years. We take them apart and wash them, and they are neither broken nor dirty. The two of us have to support several members of our family, and we have surplus money in the bank every month, and we also actively buy public bonds. In 1957, we bought sixty yuan of public bonds, and we plan to buy more this year. Because we understand that the better the country is built, the better the people's lives will be.

### 改善生活不该随心所欲

专栏：这是浪费吗？

    编者按　5日，副刊“信箱”栏发表的以“这是浪费吗？”为题的黄秀英同志的来信，已经引起了广大读者的注意。三天来，已经收到参加讨论的稿件二百一十八件。
    关于这个问题的讨论，我们将在每星期四和星期日的副刊上发表。讨论时间初步计划为一个月左右。欢迎大家联系自己的思想情况和生活中的经验教训，对这个问题发表意见。
    改善生活不该随心所欲
    咱们的国家是个大国，也是一个穷国。要建设社会主义，需要用很多很多的钱。这些钱从哪里来呢？主要是靠大家勤俭。开工厂要勤俭，过日子也要勤俭。所以党向我们提出了勤俭建国和勤俭持家的号召。
    黄秀英同志不能接受党小组会的批评，就是因为他对国家建设的困难考虑得太少了，处处想到的只是个人的生活改善问题。
    有旧大袄就不应该买短大衣。旧了可以拆洗或翻改，这既给国家节约了棉布，自己也省了钱。绒衣也是棉纱织的，可以不买的人，应该尽量不买，把那些绒衣让给最需要的人买。因为我们国家的棉花生产还赶不上需要啊！
    自己劳动挣来的钱，当然自己可以支配。但是，我认为晚花一天比早花一天好，在银行里多存一天，就是对国家建设多支援一天。至于个人的生老病死，应该尽量自己负担，不能依赖社里照顾。如果社员们有了困难都等着社里照顾，社里照顾得过来吗？社里还能积累资金吗？没有资金，又怎样发展生产呢？生产不能发展，社员的生活还能改善吗？
    党和毛主席非常关心人民的生活。我们的生活已经一天比一天好。但是，改善生活绝不能不顾国家生产发展的情况和建设中的困难呀！
    我是一个手工业合作社干部，我爱人是社员，两人每月收入平均七十多元。我们的棉衣一般都要穿四、五年，拆拆洗洗，既不破也不脏。我俩要养活一家老小好几口，每月都有余钱存在银行里，也积极买公债。1957年我们买了六十元公债，今年准备再多买些。因为我们懂得，国家建设得愈好，人民生活也愈好。
