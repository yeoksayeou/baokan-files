    Talking About Garbage Sorting
    Resident of Xin Jian Li, Xuanwu District, Beijing　Dong Xiuying
    Garbage sorting on the streets, this is really the first time ever! Garbage sorting means separating inorganic garbage from organic garbage. Inorganic garbage can be used as raw material for "hollow bricks" in the future, and organic garbage can support rural areas in accumulating fertilizer. After listening to the mobilization report of the neighborhood committee, all of our residents automatically chipped in 18 cents per household and bought twelve large wicker baskets to put at the garbage station. Moreover, some residents also implemented mutual assistance and cooperation: your household's earthen basket holds stove ashes, and their household's earthen basket holds night soil, so there's no need to buy more earthen baskets. At the beginning, we were afraid that some residents would not be used to it, so we had people on duty every day to guide everyone to avoid mistakes. This makes the garbage station more clean and orderly.
    The People's Government is so concerned about the small living problems of us residents, even turning discarded night soil into useful things, it's really the best thing ever. This inevitably reminds me of the worries that garbage brought to us residents in the old society—"the stench was everywhere" on the streets. Despite this, the puppet government still collected "sanitation donations" and "cleaning fees" every season and month, but did not do anything good for us. Garbage still piled up like small mountains on the streets. At that time, environmental sanitation was very bad, so some people described Beijing as a "garbage city." I say this is not an exaggeration at all.
    But as soon as Beijing was liberated, the People's Government mobilized a great force to remove urban garbage and greatly improved the environmental sanitation of residents. In recent years, the government has made many improvements to garbage management. Small handcarts for carrying night soil have been replaced by large trucks, and the trucks are covered with tarpaulins during transportation, for fear of affecting street sanitation. Now, in order to better improve residents' sanitation and support agricultural construction, the government has implemented the sorting and dumping of night soil every other day. We not only support this measure of the government, but we will also take practical actions to do this new work well, and contribute our urban residents' strength to the realization of the Agricultural Development Program.

    谈垃圾分类
    北京宣武区新建里居民　董秀英
    街道上垃圾分类，这还是有史以来第一次咧！垃圾分类就是将无机垃圾和有机垃圾分开。无机垃圾今后可以作
  “空心砖”的原料用，有机垃圾可以支援农村积肥。我们全体居民在听完居民委员会的动员报告后，就自动的每户凑了一角八分钱，买了十二个荆条大筐放在垃圾站。而且有些居民还实行了互助合作，你家的土筐盛炉灰，他家的土筐盛秽土，这样就不必再买土筐了。才开始的时候，怕有些居民这样不习惯，就每天有人值班，指导大家不要搞错了。这样一作使垃圾站更整洁、更有条理了。
    人民政府对我们居民细小的生活问题都这么关心，连已经废了的秽土，也变成有用的东西，真是再好也没有了。因而这就不得不使我联想起在旧社会里垃圾给我们居民带来的心病——大街小巷“臭气熏天”。尽管如此，伪政府还是逢季按月的要什么“卫生捐”，“清洁费”，却不给我们办一点好事，大街小巷垃圾仍堆的像小山一样，那时的环境卫生非常糟糕，所以有人形容那时的北京城是“垃圾城”，我说这一点也不过分。
    可是北京刚一解放，人民政府就动员了很大力量，来清除城市垃圾，大大改善了居民环境卫生。近几年来，政府对垃圾管理有了不少的改进。由小手车垃秽土，改用大汽车拉秽土，在运输时还用帆布盖着，惟恐影响街道卫生。现在政府为了更好的改进居民卫生，支援农业建设，实行了每隔一日分类倒秽土。我们不但拥护政府这一措施，我们还要用实际行动作好这一新的工作，以此为实现农业发展纲要，贡献我们城市居民一份力量。
