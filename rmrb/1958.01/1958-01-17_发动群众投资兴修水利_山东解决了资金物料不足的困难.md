Mobilizing the Masses to Invest in Water Conservancy Projects
Shandong Solves Difficulties in Funding and Materials

(Our dispatch) Shandong Province, in its farmland water conservancy construction, has relied on agricultural cooperatives and the strength of the masses to overcome the difficulties of insufficient funds and materials. According to incomplete statistics from only twenty-six counties, the masses have already invested over 75.4 million bricks, over 4.2 million yuan in funds, over 370,000 jin of reeds, over 60,000 pieces of trees and timber, and a portion of other materials. This has not only solved the shortage of materials and funds but also ensured the timely completion of tasks. For example, the masses in Fan County have invested over 16.5 million bricks and over 140,000 yuan in funds. Among the county's more than 98,000 households, the average investment per household is 167 bricks and more than 1.4 yuan. Due to the lack of material and financial resources, the engineering plan has now been overfulfilled. The original plan was to dig 5,000 wells, but more than 11,000 wells have actually been completed. The masses in Wen Shang County, which suffered severe flooding, are both carrying out production for self-relief and actively investing in water conservancy construction. They have invested over 3.3 million bricks, 5,000 yuan in funds, and a portion of other materials. The county initially planned to dig 2,500 wells, fearing that the task could not be completed due to the severity of the disaster. After the masses mobilized, this was revised to 7,400 wells. More than 3,900 brick wells and more than 800 earth wells have now been completed, and forty ponds, dams, reservoirs, and other projects have also begun. In some places where materials cannot be bought, the masses have used their ingenuity to adopt substitutes. Some areas have created substitutes for iron wire with cotton willow strips and bamboo strips, and substitutes for palm bark with reeds, mats, bamboo curtains, and sorghum stalks. They have also used wooden hoops and tile pipes to replace bamboo pipes for draining springs.

The main experiences of Shandong Province in mobilizing the masses to invest are: 1. Strengthening investigation and research, clarifying the potential and ideological situation of the masses, and inspiring commune members to invest from reality. For example, after the plan was determined in Fan County, the county party committee organized cadres to conduct in-depth investigations in agricultural cooperatives such as Shengguang, Wuxing, and Xinhua. They discovered that Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative, which had suffered crop failures for years, had more than 80,000 bricks in storage among its more than 400 households. However, the masses had ideological concerns about repayment. Based on the above ideological situation, they strengthened political education, vigorously promoted the great significance of building the country diligently and frugally, running households diligently and frugally, and running water conservancy projects diligently and frugally, and used the method of stating facts and reasoning to carry out debates, which improved the commune members' understanding of farmland water conservancy construction and strengthened their determination to overcome difficulties.

2. Cadres take the lead in investing materials and funds and set an example. For example, cadres in Xin County invested 100,000 yuan. Meng Xiansong, the party secretary of Mengmiao Township in Shan County, invested all 500 yuan of his demobilization fee in construction. The practical actions of the vast number of cadres promoted the enthusiasm of the masses to invest materials and funds.

3. Implementing the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit and signing loan contracts: In addition to conducting extensive and in-depth publicity and ideological mobilization of the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit, contracts are signed and repayment dates are agreed upon. According to the wishes of the masses, bricks are returned for bricks, materials are returned for materials, and money is reasonably discounted, with interest calculated at the bank rate. For the investment of materials by poor households, a portion of the cash is paid in advance to meet their immediate needs. After effectively resolving the ideological concerns and practical difficulties of the masses, the vast number of commune members enthusiastically launched the action of investing materials and funds.

    发动群众投资兴修水利
    山东解决了资金物料不足的困难
    本报讯　山东省在农田水利建设中，依靠农业社，依靠群众力量，克服了资金和物料不足的困难。目前仅据二十六个县不完整的统计：群众已投资砖七千五百四十余万块、款四百二十余万元、芦苇三十七万余斤、树和木料六万余件、及其它物料一部。这样不但解决了物料和资金的不足，而且保证按期完成了任务。如范县群众，现已投资砖一千六百五十余万块、款十四万余元。全县九万八千多户，平均每户投资砖一百六十七块、款一元四角多。由于物料资金不缺，现已超额完成工程计划。原计划打井五千眼，现已实际完成一万一千多眼。水灾严重的汶上县群众，一面开展生产自救，一面积极投入水利建设，现已投资砖三百三十余万块、款五千元、及其它物料一部。全县开始计划打井二千五百眼，怕因灾情严重完不成任务，群众动起来后，又修订为七千四百眼，现已完成砖井三千九百多眼、土井八百多眼和四十座塘坝，水库及其它工程也已动工。有的地方物料买不到，群众就发挥自己的智慧，采取代用品，有的地区创造以绵柳条、竹篾黄等代替铁丝，以芦苇、席子、竹帘、高粱秸等代替棕皮，以木箍管、瓦管代替竹管下泉。
    山东省发动群众投资的主要经验是：1、加强调查研究、摸清群众潜力与思想情况，从实际出发，启发社员投资，如范县计划确定后，县委就组织了干部深入到升光、五星、新华等农业社进行调查摸底工作，发现连年遭灾歉收的新华农业社在四百多户社员中即存有砖八万多块。但群众存有怕不还等思想顾虑。根据以上思想情况，加强政治教育，大力宣传勤俭建国、勤俭持家、勤俭办水利的重大意义，并采用了摆事实、讲道理的方法开展辩论，提高了社员对兴修农田水利的认识，坚定了克服困难的决心。
    2、干部带头投资投料、以身作则。如莘县干部投资达十万元，单县孟庙乡支书孟宪松同志把自己五百元的转业费全部投入建设，广大干部的实际行动，推动了群众投资投料的热情。
    3、贯彻自愿互利政策，订立借贷合同：除广泛深入的进行自愿互利政策的宣传教育和思想发动外，并订立合同、议定归还日期。根据群众自愿：要砖还砖、要物还物、要钱合理折价，并按银行利率计息。对困难户的投料就先付给部分现金以应急需。在切实解决群众思想顾虑和实际困难之后，广大社员就热烈展开了投资投料的行动。
