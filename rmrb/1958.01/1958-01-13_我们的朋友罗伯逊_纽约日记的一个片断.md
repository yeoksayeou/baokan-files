    Our Friend Robeson – A Fragment from a New York Diary
    by Soviet Writer F. Kozhevnikov

    One day, we visited Harlem (the Black district of New York – Editor's note). We didn't go there to sightsee. We went to visit a man; millions admire him, regarding his glorious name as that of an unyielding warrior for peace. His soaring, resonant, and inspiring voice resonated at the heart of the activities of people in all countries striving for peace. But at this time, shameful laws bound this man like invisible shackles, trapping him involuntarily on the rugged soil of New York, depriving him of his freedom of movement.

    We arrived at Paul Robeson's simple and small residence, and we felt excited, warm, and proud to see him in person.

    Robeson greeted us with a hearty smile. He is a giant, with a huge, passionate heart, and at the same time, he is a great singer whose great voice has been silenced in this country.

    He smiled throughout and said to us:

    "Yes, you are right, I am deprived of the opportunity to sing to the American people, but you know…"

    Then he told us that not long ago, British peace advocates had recorded some of his songs. Just a few days ago, Soviet youth reclaiming land in Kazakhstan had called him, telling him about their labor achievements. Robeson was very excited, and to express his gratitude, he sang a few songs over the phone. His singing traveled across the ocean and, via radio broadcast, resonated in the ears of tens of thousands of newcomers on the Soviet wastelands.

    Robeson was delighted, his eyes shining, and he said to us:

    "I even envy my singing, because I want to go to the places where people can hear it, and see the people who listen to my singing."

    I told him how much people longed to see him when the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in Beijing.

    Robeson lowered his head, the white hair at his temples gleaming silver in the large head. He said in a sad and low tone:

    "If my heart could turn into a bird, I would let it fly freely, let it fly to faraway China, let it tell the great and excellent Chinese people everything I want to say. The liberation of the Chinese people has brought to humanity an exceptionally powerful force and confidence to make truth triumph over falsehood."

    He eagerly inquired about the situation in those countries he loved, where he had many friends and comrades in the struggle to defend peace.

    As he listened to us, Robeson smiled pleasantly, nodding in agreement, and he said:

    "Yes, humanity has become more beautiful and wiser. Because now there are countries that serve humanity's happiness entirely, and they will use their strength to restrain war like taming a wild beast."

    He said firmly, decisively, and proudly:

    "I have never, never felt alone, because a person who dedicates his life to the struggle to unite millions of people in defending peace will not be isolated." He looked at the telephone, affectionately stroked the receiver, and said excitedly:

    "People often call me, sometimes many unknown people call me from different countries, and their words warm my heart."

    But we learned from Robeson's son that sometimes threatening voices could also be heard on the phone. These calls all came from New York. One can imagine that these calls came from people who supported the Little Rock atrocities and regarded such atrocities as acts of consolidating the "American spirit."

    Hearing this, Robeson quickly said:

    "No! These are just the sounds of annoying mosquitoes. I would never think that is the voice of the American people," he said thoughtfully, "I believe in the power of reason, justice, truth, and peace, and they will surely overcome the forces of darkness." He repeated enthusiastically, "I believe this, and that is why I proudly tell everyone that I always fight for peace, and will fight for peace in the future. Those who long for happiness for their people should not be intimidated by the misfortunes imposed on them."

    When we parted with Robeson, our hearts were filled with deep affection and pride for this outstanding figure of the American people. The people of many countries respect him very much, but his own country does not give him the freedom to sing and speak, nor does it allow him to go where he can fulfill his duty as a peace fighter.

    Robeson's image is that of an American citizen, an image that is inspiring, simple, noble, and wise. Robeson is a loyal friend of all who fight for peace. During our visit to New York, Robeson's image warmed our hearts, as if Mr. Dulles had not gone mad at the United Nations platform, had not flaunted atomic bombs, and had not foolishly raged at the mere mention of us. Robeson firmly believes that the power of the people of all countries struggling for peace in the great socialist camp is sufficient to tame the beast of war.

    我们的朋友罗伯逊——纽约日记的一个片断
    苏联作家  弗·科热夫尼科夫
    有一天，我们访问了哈莱姆区（纽约黑人区——编者注）。我们到那里去不是为了游览风光。我们去的目的是为了拜会一个人；千百万人都景仰他，把他的光荣的名字看作是一个百折不挠的和平战士的名字。他那高亢响亮振奋人心的歌喉，激荡在为和平而斗争的各国人民的活动中枢。可是就在这个时候，可耻的法律却像无形的枷锁羁绊着这个人，他身不由主地被困在坎坷不平的纽约土地上，他被剥夺了行动的自由。
    我们来到了保罗·罗伯逊的朴素纤小的寓所，我们能以亲身面睹他的仪容，内心里感到激动，感到温暖，感到骄傲。
    罗伯逊带着爽朗的微笑迎接我们。他是一个巨人，他有着一颗巨大的火热的心，同时他又是一个在这个国家里被封住了伟大歌喉的伟大歌唱家。
    他始终微笑着对我们说：
    “是的，你们说的都对，我被剥夺了向美国人民演唱的机会，但是你们知道……”
    接着他告诉我们，不久以前英国的和平拥护者已经把他唱的几首歌录了音。就在最近几天里在哈萨克斯坦开荒的苏联青年们给他打来电话，把自己劳动成果告诉了他，罗伯逊听了很激动，为了表示感激，就在电话里唱了几个歌子。他的歌声远涉重洋，并且通过无线电广播响彻在苏联荒地上成千成万新人的耳际。
    罗伯逊欣然自得，两眼闪闪发光，他对我们说：
    “就是我也羡慕我的歌声，因为我想到那能够听到这歌声的地方去，并且看看那些听我歌唱的人们。”
    我告诉他，当北京举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议时，那是如何渴望能看到他。
    罗伯逊的头低着，在那硕大的头上两鬓的白发泛着银光，他用忧伤而低沉的语调说：
    “倘若我的心能化作一只飞鸟，我将让他自由飞翔，让它飞到遥远的中国，让它向伟大而优秀的中国人民诉说出我想说的一切。中国人民的解放给人类带来了使真理战胜谬理异常强大的力量和信心。”
    他迫不及待地询问他热爱的那些国家的情况，他在这些国家里有很多在保卫和平斗争中的朋友和战友。
    罗伯逊在听我们谈话时，愉快地微笑着，点头示意，表示赞同，他说：
    “是的，如今人类已经更加美好，更加英明了。因为现在已经有了这样一些国家，它们完全为人类的幸福服务，它们会用自己的力量像降伏猛兽一样地制止战争。”
    他坚决果断而又自豪地说：
    “我从来，从来也没有感到孤独，因为一个把自己的一生献给团结千百万人的保卫和平斗争的人，是不会孤立的。”他端详一下电话机，极为亲切地抚摸着电话听筒，激动地说：
    “常常有人给我打电话，有时许多不知名的人从各国打电话给我，他们的话温暖着我的心。”
    但是我们从罗伯逊的儿子那里得知，有时从电话里也可以听到一种威吓的声音。这些电话都是从纽约打来的。可以想像，这些电话来自支持小石城暴行一流的人，他们把这种暴行当作巩固“美国精神”的行为。
    罗伯逊听到说起这些事，便赶忙说：
    “不！这不过是一些讨厌的蚊虫之音罢了。我决不认为那是美国人民的声音”，他沉思地说，“我相信理性、正义、真理和和平的力量，它们一定能战胜黑暗的势力。”他又热情地重复着说：“我相信这个，正因为这样，我才自豪地告诉所有的人，我随时随地都为和平奋斗，将来也为和平奋斗。渴望给自己人谋幸福的人，不应该被强加给他们的祸害所吓倒。”
    在我们同罗伯逊分手时，内心里充满了对美国人民的这个杰出人物的深情厚谊和骄傲。许多国家的人民都非常尊敬他，但是他自己的国家却不给他歌唱、谈话的自由，不许他到为了尽一份和平战士的义务而去的地方。
    罗伯逊的形象是一个美国公民的形象，这个形象富有感召力、朴素、高尚和英明。罗伯逊是一切为和平而战的人的忠实朋友。在我们访问纽约的日子里，罗伯逊的形象一直温暖着我们的心，好像杜勒斯先生没有在联合国的讲坛上发狂，没有炫耀原子弹，也没有一提到我们就愚蠢地狂怒起来似的。罗伯逊坚信，伟大社会主义阵营为和平而奋斗的各国人民的力量足以能降伏战争这个猛兽。
