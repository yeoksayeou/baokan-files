Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd: A number of factories and mines in Chongqing have estimated the favorable factors in this year's production and have decided to make a great leap forward in production when formulating this year's production plan. Many factories have now revised their original, preliminary, and overly low plans and have automatically increased production tasks.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's production plan for this year was formulated in September 1957. The original decision was to increase the output of steel and steel products by 27% and 17% respectively compared to 1957. However, in the fourth quarter of 1957, the factory's production level rose rapidly, and many technical and economic indicators broke through the requirements stipulated in the original plan. Therefore, on the basis of the original plan, the company formulated a plan to increase steel and steel products by more than 36,000 tons and increase the total output value by 9.95 million yuan as the goal for increasing production and practicing economy this year.

Chongqing Cement Plant originally planned to increase cement production by 7.2% this year compared to 1957. Recently, with the advent of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production, the demand for cement in various places has been very large, and the factory's major and auxiliary types of work have continuously broken quotas since October. Therefore, they have also taken measures to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials and revised this year's production plan, deciding to increase cement production by another 14% on the basis of the original plan.

Chongqing Water Turbine Plant, Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant, Jialing Machinery Plant, 610 Textile and Dyeing Plant and other units have also decided to increase the output of water turbines, alarm clocks, steel, etc. or greatly improve product quality according to the specific circumstances this year.

While formulating or revising plans, these factories and mines have also taken many measures to strengthen preparations in all aspects of production, creating conditions for further promoting the high tide of production. All factories and mines have grasped the key issues in current production, pointed out the direction from top to bottom, and mobilized the masses to solve them. Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant recently held a factory-wide technical work conference to formulate technical measures for the first half of this year, and decided to launch all factory employees from January to summarize and promote important advanced experiences in steelmaking and steel rolling. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is solving the balance problems of equipment, raw materials, transportation, tools, etc., and sending purchasing personnel to contact and overcome the difficulty of lacking pig iron this year.

    重庆一批企业积极促进生产
    推翻保守计划　重订先进计划
    新华社重庆3日电　重庆市部分厂矿估计到今年生产上各方面的有利因素，在制订今年生产计划时决定使生产大大跃进一步。不少工厂现在已经修订了原来初步确定的过低的计划，自动增加了生产任务。
    重庆钢铁公司今年的生产计划是在1957年9月份制订的，原来决定今年的钢和钢材产量分别比1957年增加27％和17％。但是1957年第四季度厂里的生产水平迅速上升，许多技术经济指标都突破了原来计划所规定的要求。因此这个公司在原订计划的基础上又订出了再增产钢和钢材三万六千多吨，增加生产总值九百九十五万元的计划，作为今年增产节约的奋斗目标。
    重庆水泥厂原计划今年水泥产量比1957年增产7.2％。最近随着工农业生产高潮的到来，各地所提出的水泥需要量都很大，而厂里各个主要工种和辅助工种从10月份以来又连续不断突破定额。因此他们也采取措施克服原材料不足的困难，重新修订了今年的生产计划，决定在原订计划基础上再增产水泥14％。
    重庆水轮机厂、重庆第三钢铁厂、嘉陵机器厂、六一○纺织染厂等单位，也根据具体情况在决定今年增加水轮机、闹钟、钢等产量或大大提高产品质量。
    在制订或修订计划的同时，这些厂矿还采取了许多措施加强生产上各方面的准备，为进一步推动生产高潮创造条件。各厂矿都抓住当前生产上的关键问题，从上到下指出方向，发动群众进行解决。重庆第三钢铁厂最近召开了全厂技术工作会议制订了今年上半年的技术措施，并决定从1月份起发动全厂职工总结和推广炼钢、轧钢方面的重要先进经验。重庆钢铁公司正在解决设备、原材料、运输、工具等方面的平衡问题，并派出采购人员联系克服今年缺少生铁的困难。
