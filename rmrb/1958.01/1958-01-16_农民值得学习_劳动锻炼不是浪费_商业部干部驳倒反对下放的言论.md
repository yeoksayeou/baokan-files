Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: The Ministry of Commerce, before its second batch of cadres were sent down to the countryside, launched a debate on whether intellectuals needed to be tempered in the countryside and whether it was worthwhile to learn from farmers. Nearly two thousand cadres directly or indirectly participated in the debate, and hundreds of big-character posters were produced. Through debates on many different opinions, everyone received a profound socialist education.

This debate was triggered by a series of dissenting views expressed by Zhu Tongfang, a cadre in the General Office of the Ministry of Commerce, regarding the issue of intellectuals participating in agricultural labor. First, she believed that sending cadres down to the countryside would not achieve the purpose of ideological transformation and the development of class feelings, arguing that: farmers are not an advanced class, farmers are selfish and self-interested. Many intellectuals have joined the trade union for seven or eight years and are already part of the working class, especially some party members, who are already advanced. Why should they still learn from farmers? At the same time, she believed that labor is the same everywhere. Working in the office is also labor, and it is advanced and complex labor. The countryside is low-level and simple labor. Why give up advanced labor to temper oneself in low-level labor? Second, she believed that intellectuals going to the countryside is a loss to the country and to the individual. A college student who has learned some specialized knowledge will abandon what he has learned in the past when he goes to the countryside to be tempered, which is a great waste.

The Rectification Leadership Group of the Ministry of Commerce believed that the ideological education of cadres sent down to the countryside must be carried out in depth and repeatedly. Therefore, Zhu Tongfang's entire statement was compiled and distributed to various units. After many units published these opinions in big-character posters, they immediately attracted everyone's attention, and the masses spontaneously launched a wave of debate. Many people posted big-character posters refuting her arguments, and many bureaus and offices held two or three forums to express their views on these opinions.

On January 7th, the General Office of the Ministry of Commerce officially held a debate on the issue of sending cadres down to the countryside. More than a dozen cadres expressed their opinions targeting Zhu Tongfang's arguments. Wang Jiayou, Su Yuande, and others first refuted Zhu Tongfang's claim that intellectuals do not need labor training and that there is nothing to learn in the countryside. Wang Jiayou said that selecting cadres from the laboring people and sending intellectuals to the labor front for tempering is the Party's firm and unwavering cadre policy. Our regime is a people's regime that serves the laboring people. This requires a cadre team with a firm stand, able to serve the laboring people wholeheartedly, and able to withstand risks. Intellectuals lack a firm stand and the feelings of the laboring people, so they especially need to be tempered on the industrial and agricultural labor front. He said that the industrial and agricultural labor fronts are places for tempering and transforming intellectuals. Now, most cadres are sent down to the countryside because the countryside is more arduous, and only the most arduous places can cultivate strong cadres. At the same time, according to the national policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, the countryside also needs a large number of knowledgeable and cultured people to support it. Su Yuande said that Zhu Tongfang deliberately emphasized the backward side of the farmers and denied that farmers have anything worth learning, which is to find excuses for her own desire for a comfortable urban life and unwillingness to endure arduous training. It should be seen that the most essential advantages of farmers are their determination to resolutely take the socialist road, their diligent and simple thoughts and feelings, and their rich production knowledge, which are all worth learning for intellectuals.

Some also refuted Zhu Tongfang's claim that since intellectuals have joined the trade union, they are the working class and therefore do not need to learn from farmers. They said that although intellectuals join the trade union because they are mental laborers, their thinking still contains varying degrees of bourgeois ideas. Even some Communist Party members degenerate and deteriorate due to poor ideological transformation. It is completely wrong to think that there is no need for transformation after joining the trade union. Many people also pointed out that Zhu Tongfang's view of dividing labor into advanced labor and low-level labor is a completely decadent idea of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," which fully demonstrates her strong idea of despising physical labor.

The nine cadres of the first batch sent down to Jixian County, Hebei Province, by the Pharmaceutical Company affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce collectively wrote a letter to participate in this debate. They forcefully refuted Zhu Tongfang's erroneous arguments with their own practical experience. They said in their letter: "After we arrived in the countryside, we felt that there were too many things to learn. For example, in order to achieve bumper harvests and leap forward, the members of the agricultural cooperative we were in drained water, dug mud, and carried water to irrigate wheat in the severe cold of minus ten degrees Celsius. Some people's hands and feet were cracked and bleeding, but they did not retreat. Many women got up at five o'clock in the morning and went to bed in the middle of the night to do housework, and still participated in labor the next day. These seem to be very ordinary things, but they are things that we intellectuals could not do in the past." They also talked about the class education they received in the countryside. For example, when the agricultural cooperative they were in distributed dividends last year, the poor and lower-middle peasants were very satisfied, some middle peasants clamored that it was not enough, and the well-to-do middle peasants quarreled even more fiercely, which clearly showed the attitudes of various classes.

Many companies also launched discussions on whether sending intellectuals to do labor is a waste of talent. Many people believe that the Party allows us to go to the countryside to temper ourselves in order to cultivate intellectuals into cadres who are both red and expert, which fully demonstrates the Party's care and concern for intellectuals. How can it be said to be a waste? If intellectuals are unwilling to transform themselves and eventually develop into right-wing elements who oppose the Party and socialism, that is the biggest waste.

Through this debate, many cadres have more clearly understood the significance of labor training, and a few cadres who sympathized with Zhu Tongfang's arguments to some extent have also clarified their thinking. Now, the list of the second batch of cadres to be sent down to the countryside has been announced, and all those who have been approved have stepped onto the agricultural labor front with unparalleled excitement and determination.

### 农民值得学习　劳动锻炼不是浪费  商业部干部驳倒反对下放的言论

    农民值得学习　劳动锻炼不是浪费
    商业部干部驳倒反对下放的言论
    据新华社14日讯　商业部在第二批干部下放以前展开了一场关于知识分子需不需要到农村去锻炼、是否值得向农民学习等问题的大辩论。全部直接或间接参加辩论的干部近二千人，为这一问题而出的大字报有几百张，通过许多不同意见的争辩，使大家又受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    这场辩论是由商业部办公厅干部朱彤芳对于知识分子参加农业劳动问题发表了一系列不同意的看法而引起的。首先她认为把干部下放到农村达不到改造思想和锻炼阶级感情的目的，理由是：农民不是先进的阶级，农民自私自利，今天许多知识分子加入工会七、八年了，已经是工人阶级的一部分，特别是一些党员，他们已经是先进的，为什么还要向农民学习？同时她认为，劳动到处都一样，在机关工作也是劳动，而且这里是高级复杂的劳动，农村是低级简单的劳动，为什么放弃了高级劳动而到低级劳动中去锻炼？其次，她认为知识分子下乡对国家、对个人都是损失，一个大学生学了一些专门知识，到农村锻炼，过去学过的都要抛弃掉，这是很大的浪费。
    商业部整风领导小组认为对下放干部的思想教育工作，必须深入地反复地进行，因此把朱彤芳的全部言论整理后分发给各单位。许多单位用大字报公布了这些意见后，立即引起大家的注意，群众自动掀起了辩论的热潮，有不少人贴大字报反驳她的论点，许多局、处举行了二、三次座谈会，针对这些意见表示自己的看法。
    1月7日，商业部办公厅正式举行了对下放干部问题的辩论会，有十多个干部针对着朱彤芳的论点发表了意见。王家佑、苏元德等人首先反驳了朱彤芳所说的知识分子用不着劳动锻炼和农村中没有什么可以学习的论点。王家佑说，从劳动人民中选拔干部以及把知识分子放到劳动战线上去锻炼是党的坚定不移的干部政策，我们的政权是人民政权，是为劳动人民服务的，这就需要有一支立场坚定、能全心全意为劳动人民服务、经得起风险的干部队伍，而知识分子恰恰缺乏坚定的立场和劳动人民的感情，因此特别需要到工农业劳动战线上去锻炼。他说，工农业劳动战线都是锻炼和改造知识分子的场所，现在把大部分干部下放到农村，是因为农村比较艰苦，只有到最艰苦的地方才能锻炼出坚强的干部，同时根据国家工农业并举的方针，农村也需要大批有知识有文化的人去支援。苏元德说，朱彤芳故意强调农民落后的一面，否认农民有值得学习的东西，这是为她自己的贪图城市安逸生活、不愿受艰苦的锻炼寻找借口。应该看到农民最本质的优点就是他们有坚决走社会主义道路的决心、勤劳朴实的思想感情和丰富的生产知识等等，这些都是值得知识分子学习的。
    也有人反驳了朱彤芳所说的知识分子既然已经参加工会就是工人阶级，因此不需要向农民学习的说法。他们说，知识分子虽然由于自己是脑力劳动者而参加了工会，但是他们思想上还存在着程度不同的资产阶级思想，共产党员中也有因思想改造不好而蜕化变质的，认为参加了工会就不需要改造那是完全错误的。还有许多人指出，朱彤芳把劳动分为高级劳动和低级劳动的观点，完全是一种“劳心者治人、劳力者治于人”的腐朽思想，这充分表现了她存在着浓厚的轻视体力劳动的思想。
    商业部所属医药公司第一批下放到河北省蓟县的九名干部集体写信回来参加了这场大辩论，他们以自己的实际体会有力地驳斥了朱彤芳的错误论点。他们来信中说：“我们到农村后感到可以学习的东西太多了，例如为了丰产跃进，我们所在的农业社社员们在零下十几度的严寒里，排水挖泥，挑水浇麦，有的人手脚冻得裂口流血，但是他们没有退却。许多妇女起五更睡半夜做家务活，第二天一样参加劳动，这些看来是极平常的事，却是我们知识分子过去做不到的。”他们还谈到在农村受到的阶级教育，例如他们所在农业合作社去年分红时，贫雇农非常满意，有些中农嚷着不够，富裕中农吵得更凶，这就明显地看出各个阶层的态度。
    许多公司在座谈讨论中也对于知识分子下放劳动是不是浪费人才等问题展开了讨论。许多人认为，党为了把知识分子培养成又红又专的干部，才让我们到农村去锻炼，这充分表现了党对知识分子的爱护和关怀，怎么能说是浪费呢？知识分子如果不愿意改造，最后发展成反党、反社会主义的右派分子才是最大的浪费。
    通过这场辩论，使许多干部更加明确了劳动锻炼的意义，有少数在某一点上或某种程度上同情朱彤芳的论点的干部也澄清了思想，现在这个部第二批下放的名单已经公布，所有被批准的人都以无比兴奋的心情更加坚定地走上了农业劳动战线。
