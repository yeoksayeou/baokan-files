Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th:  British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Heathcoat Amory, stated at a Conservative Party conference in Chislehurst on the 17th that the British government does not intend to abandon its "tough" policy, which is primarily aimed at restricting domestic consumption.

    In explaining the basis of the economic and fiscal policies he plans to implement, the Chancellor said that inflation remains Britain's "number one enemy." Using this as an excuse, he vehemently opposed wage increases and demanded strict control over social welfare spending. He stated that he would rather stick to this unpopular policy "than take popular actions."

    "Reynolds News" commented on Heathcoat Amory's remarks, pointing out that the Chancellor's words indicate that the government intends to continue implementing further cuts in allocations for healthcare, housing, and school construction, and to continue pursuing a wage freeze policy. The newspaper suggested using other methods to balance government revenue and expenditure, such as reducing the annual military expenditure of up to £1.6 billion and raising the profit tax on capitalists.

    英国财政政策舍本逐末  不削减军费而限制消费
    新华社20日讯伦敦消息：英国新任财政大臣希思寇特—埃默里17日在夏耳登保守党员大会上表示，英国政府今后不打算放弃以限制国内消费为主要目的的“硬性”政策。
    这位财政大臣在阐述他计划实行的经济和财政政策的基础时说，通货膨胀仍然是英国的“头号敌人”。他以此作为借口，竭力反对增加工资，并且要求严格控制社会福利开支。他表示，他宁愿坚持这种不得人心的政策，“而不采取得民心的行动”。
    “雷诺新闻”就希思寇特—埃默里的言论指出，财政大臣的言论表明：政府打算继续推行进一步削减对保健、住宅和学校建筑的拨款，并且继续推行冻结工资的政策。这家报纸建议用其他办法来平衡政府的收支，例如削减每年高达十六亿英镑的军费和提高资本家的利得税等。
