Ubiquitous Eavesdropping Devices

In order to undermine the workers' movement and monitor workers and union activities, American capitalists have hired a large number of spies. Many of the spies employed by large corporations are former agents of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The person in charge of labor policy at Ford Motor Company is a former employee of the FBI.

In addition to giving false testimony in court and before the Un-American Activities Committee, framing progressives, and creating discord among workers, an important activity of the spies hired by capitalists is to eavesdrop on workers' conversations and union meetings.

The American "Popular Science Magazine" said in an article not long ago that American capitalists often install eavesdropping devices in workers' lounges, meeting rooms, and next to public telephones in order to monitor workers' speech. "Popular Science Magazine" introduced several types of small eavesdropping devices. The smallest can be hidden on the body without revealing any trace. Some eavesdropping devices are only the size of a silver dollar.

American eavesdropping devices also have an extremely vulgar use. The American yellow publication "Confidential" also uses it. This vulgar publication, which specializes in reporting on the private lives of movie actors, also equips prostitutes with eavesdropping devices when hiring them to spy on movie actors' secrets.

    无孔不入的偷听器
    为了破坏工人运动，监视工人与工会活动，美国资本家雇用了大批的密探。许多大企业雇用的密探过去大都当过中央情报局、联邦调查局的特务。福特汽车公司主持劳工政策的人就是联邦调查局从前的一个雇员。
    资本家雇用的密探除了在法庭与非美活动调查委员会上作假见证、陷害进步人士、制造工人之间的不和以外，偷听工人的谈话与工会会议的情况是他们的重要活动。
    美国“通俗科学杂志”不久以前在一篇文章里说，美国资本家为了监视工人的言论，往往在工人休息室里、会议室里以及公共电话旁边装上了偷听器。“通俗科学杂志”介绍了几种小型的偷听器。最小的可以藏在身上，丝毫不露形迹。有的偷听器只有一枚银元大小。
    美国的偷听器还有一个极端下流的用途。美国黄色刊物“秘闻”也利用了它。原来这个专以报道电影演员私生活为号召的下流刊物，在雇用妓女去刺探电影演员的秘密时，也给妓女们装上偷听器。　（乐山）
