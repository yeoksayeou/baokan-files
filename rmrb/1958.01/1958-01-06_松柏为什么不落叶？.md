Why Don't Pine and Cypress Trees Lose Their Leaves?

    The leaves of pine and cypress trees are needle-shaped, with a relatively small surface area, and there is a layer of wax on the surface of the leaves. Therefore, the water inside the tree is not easily evaporated, the metabolism is relatively slow, and the life of the leaves is relatively long, about three years. Pine and cypress leaves do not completely fail to fall; every spring, when new leaves grow, some old leaves always fall off, but the amount is small and inconspicuous. (Zhe)

    松柏为什么不落叶？
    松柏的叶子是针状的，表面积比较小，并且在叶子的表面上还有一层蜡质。因此树里边的水分便不容易蒸发出去，新陈代谢也比较慢，叶子的寿命就比较长，大约可以活三年。松柏的叶子并不是完全不落，每年春季当新叶子长出来时，总有一部分老的叶子掉下来，不过数量不大，不显著就是了。　（哲）
