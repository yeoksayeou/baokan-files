The Struggle Between Two Worldviews
——A Record of a Great Debate on Ideology in the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China
Lu Shichao

Recently, students in the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China launched a great debate on the "Two Roads," and all students in the department received a profound socialist ideological education during the debate.

Ideological Problems Exist Among Students

Most of the students in the Philosophy Department are young students who have graduated from high school. Over the past year or so, many students have shown positive enthusiasm and a desire to improve. However, generally speaking, they still lack a clear proletarian worldview, and thus have many ideological problems. Some people have serious individualism, subjectivism, and liberalism. Especially since the Hungarian incident last year, many people have exposed wavering in their political stance. This became even more obvious during the Great Blooming and Letting and the anti-Rightist struggle. Through the great anti-Rightist struggle, the wavering of political positions and certain bourgeois political views were powerfully criticized, which enabled everyone to improve politically. However, bourgeois individualism is still firmly rooted in the minds of many people. Under the domination of various "great ideals," some people arrange their studies, styling themselves as genius poets and writers, specializing in literary books, and those who want to be scientists only delve into basic natural science courses; some are even busy establishing their own theoretical systems. They do not understand what kind of science studying Marxist philosophy is, nor do they understand what kind of philosophical workers the socialist motherland needs. They are unwilling to study professional knowledge diligently, nor are they serious about improving themselves ideologically and politically. On the contrary, they often "justifiably" argue for their individualism: saying that young people should have great "ideals" and "ambitions," and only studying natural science well meets the "requirements of the times," otherwise they are "braggarts" and "jacks-of-all-trades," saying that "specialization is redness," and as long as they have knowledge, they can serve the people in the future, without the need to undergo labor training and ideological transformation.

These facts show that in order to enable students to arrange their studies according to the requirements of the socialist motherland and cultivate working-class intellectuals, especially Marxist propaganda cadres, it is necessary to launch a great debate on the "Two Lines" among students.

Raise Questions and Launch Debate

During the Great Blooming and Letting phase of the school's rectification campaign, in addition to making many correct criticisms and suggestions on the work of the leadership, students also reflected many incorrect ideas. In the spirit of carrying out socialist education while rectifying, the Party branch prepared to guide students to resolve some fundamental ideological problems through debate. First, the training objectives and teaching plan were handed over to the students for discussion, and it was repeatedly explained to the students that the purpose of the discussion was to clarify understanding and unify thinking, and to mobilize everyone to break through their concerns and express their opinions freely. Initially, the students raised some specific issues, such as requesting an increase in class hours for natural science, increasing elective literature courses, requesting the opening of Russell's philosophy, reducing the time for compulsory labor, and so on. A few individuals also expressed some opinions on the relationship between redness and expertise, such as saying "philosophers are not equal to politicians," etc. In order to inspire everyone to further expose their thoughts and launch debate, the Party branch summarized the following questions from the questions raised by everyone: First, what kind of philosophical workers does the socialist motherland need? Second, what are the requirements for departmental scientific knowledge in the study of philosophy? Which departmental knowledge should be the focus during the study period? What is our professional knowledge? To what extent should we specialize? Third, is a philosopher necessarily a politician? What is the relationship between studying philosophy and ideological transformation? What place should labor education occupy in school education? Fourth, why should we study idealist knowledge? How should we study it?

Around these central issues, everyone expressed many different opinions, which quickly brought the debate to a climax, especially on the issue of "redness and expertise," which sparked heated debate.

Two Worldviews, Two Roads

After the discussion around the above central issues unfolded, a sharp opposition of two opinions was formed. Regarding the relationship between philosophy and politics, some students believed that "philosophers are not equal to politicians." Now we should seize the time to read more books, master more knowledge, and learn more natural science; social science can be self-studied in the future, and participating in political struggle is something that will happen when we go to work in society. Some students said, "I just want to be a 'gentleman on the roof beam,' as long as I learn my skills well, I can just be a middle-of-the-road person politically." Some students said, "Politics is so dry and boring, and when I think about becoming a political teacher in the future, I feel that this fate is too sad, and this life is over." Some said that we are studying Marxist philosophy, and the major itself is "red," so there is no need for ideological transformation. Regarding the relationship between philosophy and specific sciences, many students believe that only by studying one or two specific sciences well and studying and solving the philosophical problems in them can one be called a philosopher. As for those who do political and ideological work, they are "braggarts," "jacks-of-all-trades," and "floaters." Some proposed that the physics and mathematics courses in the philosophy department should be taught in the same way as the physics and mathematics departments of universities, saying that the natural science knowledge in the philosophy department should reach the level of Engels in five years. Regarding idealism, some greatly praised its "profoundness" and its "rational part," and one student proposed to open Russell's philosophy, and some even argued that God exists. Regarding participation in physical labor and ideological transformation, some students also expressed opposition, saying that labor cannot transform anyone, it is a waste of time, and it is more beneficial for me to read a few more books.

The opinion that has been taking the upper hand has been in sharp contrast to these views, and many students have stood up to refute those erroneous views. They used the actual situation of the students and the vivid examples of the anti-Rightist struggle to illustrate that Marxist philosophy is a science with a high degree of Party spirit, and to be a Marxist philosopher, one must be a Marxist political activist. They pointed out that emphasizing the study of specific sciences and believing that studying philosophy and engaging in ideological and political work is "bragging" is essentially despising Marxist philosophy, a serious tendency to deviate from politics, and they are trying to replace the training goals of the philosophy department of a socialist university. In philosophy itself, they are also attempting to negate Marxism with idealism. Regarding the issue of participating in physical labor and ideological transformation, everyone made a powerful criticism of the idea of despising physical labor from the path of Chinese intellectuals participating in the revolution and self-transformation, as well as their own experiences in labor, explaining that intellectuals must undergo the tempering of revolutionary struggle and labor in order to transform themselves.

When various opinions had basically been expressed, the leadership clearly pointed out that the differences in our learning objectives and learning attitudes reflected the struggle between two roads and two worldviews. After the leadership pointed out the essence, many students who originally adhered to the correct views became more firm; students who were originally vague and hesitant between the two opinions gradually clarified their direction; students who originally adhered to the wrong views increasingly felt that they were in the wrong, some changed their views, and some began to doubt their views. The majority of students have initially realized that the issues discussed this time are fundamental in nature, and the two roads taken in learning are: one is to proceed from the interests of bourgeois individualism, blindly pursuing personal fame, fortune, and status; the other is to proceed from the interests of socialism, wholeheartedly serving the people. The former is the result of the bourgeois worldview at work, and the latter is the manifestation of the working-class worldview. Those propositions of "specialization first, redness later" are essentially a fig leaf for "only specialization, no redness."

It is Necessary to Establish a Communist Worldview

Through the gradually deepening debate, all students in the department have gained a great deal ideologically. These gains have laid a good foundation for future learning.

First of all, the vast majority of students have realized that there is also a struggle between two roads in learning, and the reason why students have taken two different learning paths is because they hold two different worldviews. Some students said that they originally thought that they could learn whatever they liked, and it was their own business; now they were shocked and realized the terrible influence of bourgeois ideology. After discussion, establishing a communist worldview has become the direction of everyone's efforts. The momentum of individualism no longer exists. In the past, when talking about those arrogant personal plans, they were smug, but now when they recall them, they think they are shameful. Secondly, there is a clearer understanding of the philosophy major. Many people realize that philosophy is a science with a high degree of Party spirit, it is the theoretical basis of the great communist cause, and it is the only correct method to transform the world, and it is glorious to be a propagandist of Marxist truth. Many students who did not have firm professional ideas have further stabilized their determination to study this major. Some students said, "I was not interested in philosophy in the past, and always wanted to transfer departments, but now I won't leave even if you let me." Third, many students have realized the necessity of participating in political struggle, physical labor, and transforming their thinking through debate. One student said: After the anti-Rightist struggle, he summed up a wrong lesson: "It's best not to care about politics." This time, he participated in the debate with this attitude, thinking that I would not express my opinions on political issues, only talk about the issue of studying natural science. But now I see: this still reflects the struggle between two roads, and I have not escaped from the political struggle. A student who had not been close to his classmates, often buried himself in the library to read books, and was determined to create a new theory, through this debate, discovered that he was too far away from reality and the masses, and was determined to participate in practical training in the future, and proposed to go to the countryside to participate in labor training.

Through the debate, the students clarified their direction, boosted their enthusiasm for learning, and generally attached importance to political activities, socialist education, and voluntary labor. The relationship between students is also more united than before, and a new and prosperous atmosphere has emerged in the whole department.

    两种世界观的斗争
    ——记中国人民大学哲学系的一场思想大辩论
    卢士超
    中国人民大学哲学系学生最近开展了“两条道路”的大辩论，全系学生在辩论中受到一次深刻的社会主义思想教育。
    同学中存在着思想问题
    哲学系同学大部分是高中毕业的青年学生，一年多来，许多同学表现了积极热情、要求上进等优点。但是，一般说来他们还缺少明确的无产阶级世界观，因而思想问题是很多的。有的人存在着严重的个人主义、主观主义、自由主义。特别是去年匈牙利事件以来，不少人暴露了政治立场的动摇。而在大鸣大放和反右派斗争中，表现得更为明显。经过伟大的反右派斗争，政治立场的动摇以及某些资产阶级政治观点受到了有力的批判，使大家在政治上提高了一步。但是，资产阶级个人主义在不少人头脑中还很牢固。有的人在各种“伟大理想”的支配下安排着自己的学习，自命为天才的诗人和作家的，专读文艺书籍，想做科学家的只钻自然科学基础课程；有的甚至忙着建立自己的理论体系。他们不理解学马克思主义哲学是一门什么样的科学，也不了解社会主义祖国需要什么样的哲学工作者。他们不肯踏实地学习专业知识，也不认真地在思想上政治上提高自己。相反地，他们却往往“理直气壮”地为自己的个人主义论证：说什么青年人应当有伟大的“理想”和“抱负”，只有学好自然科学才合乎“时代的要求”，否则就是“吹牛家”“万金油”，说什么“专就是红”，只要有知识将来就可以为人民服务，不必要经过劳动锻炼和思想改造。
    这些事实表明，为了使同学们按照社会主义祖国的要求来安排自己的学习，培养出工人阶级知识分子特别是马克思主义的宣传干部，就必须在同学中开展一次“两条路线”的大辩论。
    提出问题展开辩论
    在学校整改阶段的大鸣大放中，同学们除了对领导工作提出了许多正确的批评和建议外，也反映了许多不正确的思想。党总支本着一边整改一边进行社会主义教育的精神，准备引导同学通过辩论解决一些根本性质的思想问题。首先把培养目标和教学计划交给同学讨论，并反复向同学说明讨论的目的是为了澄清认识，统一思想，动员大家打破顾虑，各抒己见。最初同学们提出的都是些具体问题，如要求增加自然科学的课时，增加文学选修课，要求开设罗素哲学，减少义务劳动时间等等。个别人对红和专的关系问题也发表了些意见，如说“哲学家不等于政治家”等。为了启发大家进一步暴露思想和开展争论，党总支从大家提出的问题中概括出以下几个问题：一，社会主义祖国需要什么样的哲学工作者？二，学习哲学对部门科学知识的要求如何？在学习期间应以哪些部门知识为主？我们的专业知识是什么？应该专到什么程度？三，哲学家是否一定是政治家？学习哲学与思想改造的关系如何？劳动教育在学校教育中应占什么地位？四，我们为什么要学唯心主义知识？应如何学法？
    围绕着这几个中心问题，大家发表了许多不同的见解，很快就使辩论走向高潮，特别是在“红与专”的问题上展开了热烈的争辩。
    两种世界观两条道路
    围绕上面几个中心问题的讨论展开以后，形成了两种意见的尖锐对立。关于哲学和政治的关系，有的同学认为“哲学家不等于政治家”。现在应当抓紧时间多看书多掌握些知识，多学习些自然科学；社会科学将来可以自修，参加政治斗争是将来到社会上工作时候的事。有的同学说，“我就愿做个‘梁上君子’只要学好本事，政治上只要做个中间分子就可以了。”有的同学说，“政治就是干巴巴的，想到将来要当政治教师，就觉得这种命运太可悲了，这一辈子完了。”有的说，我们学的是马克思主义哲学，专业本身就是“红”的，不必再进行思想改造。关于哲学和具体科学的关系问题，许多同学认为只有学好一两门具体科学，研究解决其中的哲学问题才称得起是哲学家。至于作政治思想工作的人，那是“吹牛家”、“万金油”、“水上漂”。有的提出哲学系的物理数学课程也要像大学物理系数学系一样的教学，说哲学系五年内自然科学知识起码要达到恩格斯的水平。关于唯心主义，有人大加赞赏它的“深奥”，它的“合理部分”，有个同学提出要求开罗素哲学，有人甚至论证上帝是存在的。关于参加体力劳动和思想改造问题，有些同学也表示反对，说劳动改造不了什么人，浪费时间，还不如多看几本书对我有益。
    和这些看法针锋相对的意见一直是占着上风的，许多同学起来驳斥那些错误的看法。他们用同学中的实际情况和反右派斗争的生动事例说明，马克思主义哲学是具有高度党性的科学，要做马克思主义哲学家就必须是马克思主义的政治活动家。他们指出，强调学习具体科学而认为学哲学、从事思想政治工作就是“吹牛家”的实质是轻视马克思主义哲学，是一种严重的脱离政治倾向，他们是在偷换社会主义大学哲学系的培养目标。而在哲学本身，又是企图以唯心主义来否定马克思主义。对于参加体力劳动和思想改造问题，大家从中国知识分子参加革命和自我改造的途径以及自己在劳动中的体会，对轻视体力劳动的思想作了有力的批判，说明知识分子必须经过革命斗争和劳动的锻炼，才能改造自己。
    当各种意见已经基本上发表出来以后，领导上明确指出，在我们的学习目的和学习态度的分歧上，反映着两条道路、两种世界观的斗争。领导上指出实质以后，许多原来坚持正确看法的同学更加坚定了；原来模糊不清、犹豫于两种意见之间的同学，逐渐明确了方向；原来坚持错误看法的同学，愈来愈感到理屈，有的改变了自己的看法，有的开始怀疑自己的看法。大多数同学已经初步地认识到这次所讨论的问题是带有根本性质的在学习中所采取的两条道路：一条是从资产阶级个人主义的利益出发，一味追求个人的名利、地位；一条是从社会主义利益出发，全心全意地为人民服务。前者是资产阶级世界观在作祟，后者是工人阶级世界观的表现。那些“先专后红”的主张，实质上是“只专不红”的遮羞布。
    必须树立共产主义世界观
    经过逐步深入的辩论，全系同学在思想上得到了很大的收获。这些收获，为今后的学习打下了良好的基础。
    首先，绝大多数同学认识到了在学习上也有两条道路的斗争，同学们所以采取了两条不同的学习道路，是由于抱着两种不同的世界观。有的同学说原来以为我自己爱好什么就学什么，这是自己的事；现在才大吃一惊，觉悟到资产阶级思想影响的可怕。经过讨论，树立共产主义世界观已经成为大家努力的方向。个人主义的气势已经不复存在。以前谈到那些狂妄的个人打算时，洋洋得意，现在回忆起来，则认为是可耻的了。其次，对哲学专业有了比较明确的认识。许多人认识到哲学是一门具有高度党性的科学，它是伟大的共产主义事业的理论基础，是改造世界唯一正确的方法，做一个马克思主义真理的宣传员是光荣的。许多专业思想不巩固的同学，进一步稳定了学习这门专业的决心。有的同学说“过去对哲学没有兴趣，总想转系，现在让我走我也不走了。”第三，很多同学通过辩论，体会到参加政治斗争、体力劳动和改造思想的必要性。一个同学说：在反右派斗争后，自己总结了一条错误的教训：“不关心政治为妙”，这次就抱着这个态度来参加辩论的，心想有关政治的问题我不提意见，只谈学自然科学的问题。可是现在一看：这还是反映了两条道路的斗争，我又没有从政治斗争中逃避掉。一个一向不大与同学接近，常年钻在图书馆里看书，一心想创立新学说的同学，通过这次辩论，发觉自己脱离实际脱离群众太远了，决心今后要好好参加实际锻炼，并提出要求下乡参加劳动锻炼。
    经过辩论，同学们明确了方向，鼓起了学习的劲头，对政治活动、社会主义教育、义务劳动普遍地重视起来。同学之间的关系也比以前更加团结，全系出现了一片欣欣向荣的新气象。
