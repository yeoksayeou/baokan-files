    An Industrious and Hardworking Old Lady
    Zhang Yueying, an old lady from Tianjin, is a widely praised role model for learning and also an enthusiastic "little teacher" in the street's literacy campaign.

    Zhang Yueying is over forty years old this year. For half of her life, she didn't even know simple numbers. In 1951, she joined the street literacy class. During her studies, she was diligent and conscientious. Because she was busy with housework during the day and unable to study, she would seize the time in the evening and often stayed up late reading. From the time she entered the class until now, she has maintained this for six years. Thanks to her diligent study and hard work, she has now graduated from elementary school with excellent grades.

    一个勤学苦练的老大娘
    天津市张月英老大娘是一个为人们所经常称道的学习模范，同时又是热心于街道扫盲工作的“小先生”。
    张月英今年四十多岁了，过去半辈子连简单的数字都不认识。1951年她参加了街道扫盲班学习，在学习中，她刻苦、认真，白天因为忙于家务，无法学习，她就紧紧抓住晚上的时间，常常到深夜了，她还是手不释卷。从入学到现在，六年如一日。由于这样的勤学苦练，现在她已经小学毕业，而且成绩优良。
