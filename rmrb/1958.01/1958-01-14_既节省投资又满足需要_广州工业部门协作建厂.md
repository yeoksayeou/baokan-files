Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 13th: Industrial construction departments in Guangzhou are implementing many measures in carrying out the "building the country through diligence and thrift" policy.

    In the past, with the completion of new factories, service industries and medical rooms would also appear within the factory. The larger the factory, the more these industries would expand along with it. Even if several factories were closely connected, each would still have its own set. Now, the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Committee has decided that all new factories will no longer have these ancillary facilities. Instead, public service industries, medical clinics, and recreational activity places will be established within the industrial zones that are taking shape. This will not only save money but also meet the needs of the workers. Moreover, medical clinics and the like, being more centralized, can be better managed.

    Close collaboration between factories is an important method of saving. The newly built Guangzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has decided to share a boiler with the Guangzhou Ramie Textile Factory, which is under construction. Without affecting production, this can save tens of thousands of yuan. A paper mill that is being planned and another factory are located next to each other. After research, it was determined that only one wharf needs to be built for both factories to share, which will not only save construction funds but also lower future production costs. In addition, the two factories will also share dining halls and roads.

    In terms of design work, the use of steel and cement will be saved as much as possible. For example, the Guangzhou Ramie Textile Factory originally planned to use cement to pave roads, but it has now been decided not to.

    In the past, larger factories were equipped with fire engines, each with several staff members. However, when a fire actually occurred, one fire engine was not enough. Now, the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Committee has decided that all new factories will not be equipped with fire engines. Instead, they will contact the public security departments to establish fire stations in certain areas, which is beneficial for both saving money and ensuring safety.

    In terms of factory dormitory construction and furniture use, all new factories in Guangzhou will adopt reasonable and lower standards. Generally, single-person dormitories have double-decker beds, and furniture costs will not exceed ten yuan per person.

    既节省投资又满足需要
    广州工业部门协作建厂
    新华社广州13日电　广州市工业建设部门在贯彻执行“勤俭建国”方针方面采取了许多措施。
    过去随着新厂的建成，服务性行业和医疗室等便在厂内跟着出现。厂的规模愈大，这种行业也随着扩大。尽管几个厂紧紧相连，也各搞一套。现在，广州市建设委员会已决定所有新建的厂不再附设这套设备，而在即将形成的几个工业区内设立公共的服务性行业、医疗所和文娱活动场所等。这样做既可以节省费用，又能满足职工的需要。而且像医疗所等，由于比较集中，可以办得更好。
    密切厂与厂间的协作是节约的一个重要方法。新建广州第二棉纺织厂已决定和正在兴建中的广州苎麻纺织厂合用锅炉，在不影响生产的情况下，可以节省好几十万元。正在筹建的一个造纸厂和另外一个厂由于厂址相邻，经研究只要建一座码头就可以够两厂共用，不但节省建设资金，而且将来的生产成本也将降低。另外，两厂还将合用饭堂和道路。
    在设计工作方面，将尽量节约钢筋水泥的用量。如广州苎麻纺织厂原准备用水泥铺路面，现在已经决定不用。
    过去比较大的厂都设有消防车，一部消防车有好几个工作人员，而真正碰到火警的时候，一部消防车又不够用。现在，广州市建设委员会已决定新建厂一律不设消防车，而和公安部门联系在一定地区设立消防站，这对节约和安全都有利。
    在工厂的宿舍建筑和家具使用方面，广州各新建厂都将采用合理的较低的标准。一般单人宿舍是双层床铺，家具费每人不超过十元。
