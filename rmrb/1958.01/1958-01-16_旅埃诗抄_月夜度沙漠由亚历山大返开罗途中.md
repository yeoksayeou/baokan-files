Poems from a Journey to Egypt

    Passing Through the Desert on a Moonlit Night, Returning to Cairo from Alexandria
                                Guo Moruo
    The bright moon illuminates the desolate desert,
    Yellow sand stretches straight into the sky.
    Galloping past the pyramids,
    Memories of the solar boat arise.
    Labor remains the same, past and present,
    But management undergoes transformation.
    We shall see human determination prevail,
    Turning vast expanses into fertile fields.

    Before the pyramids, an excavation
    Revealed a giant wooden boat,
    Burial object of King Cheops, 4700 years ago.
    Ancient Egyptians believed the dead would be resurrected,
    Taking a boat to fly into the sun palace,
    Hence the name "solar boat" for the burial ship.
    -- Note by Pu Chu

    Visiting Luxor, the Ancient Capital of Egypt, Boating on the Nile on a Moonlit Night
                                      Guo Moruo
    The city is quiet, people have settled down,
    The sky is high, the moon is full.
    Ancient temples stand with rows of pillars,
    A light boat floats with a single sail.
    The melodious singing rises and falls,
    The murmuring waves chatter.
    A Nile River night,
    Spanning six thousand years.

    Responding to Mr. Guo Moruo's "Passing Through the Desert on a Moonlit Night"
                                 Zhao Puchu
    The great desert becomes a silver sea,
    Clear light shines across the sky.
    We think of the old horse in difficulty,
    And thank the spaceship for its vastness.
    We have already seen the world changing,
    And can cause mountains and valleys to shift.
    Wherever clear streams flow,
    Lotus leaves will naturally fill the fields.

    Responding to Guo Lao's Poem "Luxor Night"
                                 Zhao Puchu
    Poetic thoughts rise to the distant sky,
    The moon overhead is round again.
    We should cherish thoughts of a thousand years,
    And live up to this full moon hanging high.
    The souls of the people live in the ancient tombs,
    The spark of fire is passed on in the broken monuments.
    Our eyes behold the future world,
    And our bodies enter the primordial age.

    Luxor has extremely rich ancient relics. The ancestral halls and buildings of three to four thousand years ago are magnificent, and the murals and sculptures are numerous and exquisite. The hieroglyphs on the stone tablets are important historical materials for the study of ancient Egypt.

    Passing Through Budapest, Spending the Night on the Danube
                          Zhao Puchu
    We all admire the good blue sky,
    Now passing over the Danube River.
    Ancient bunkers cast disorderly reflections,
    A deep meaning echoes back.
    The October winds and clouds have changed,
    Tonight the moonlight is abundant.
    We watch the evil atmosphere being cleansed away,
    And joy exudes in clear songs.

    旅埃诗抄
    月夜度沙漠由亚历山大返开罗途中
                                郭沫若
    明月照荒漠，黄沙直入天，驰过金字塔，回忆太阳船。劳力无今古，经纶有变迁，会看人定胜，万顷化良田。
    金字塔前发掘，得一巨型木船，为四千七百年杰俄普王殉葬之物。古埃及人信死者将复活，乘船飞入日宫，故名殉葬之船为太阳船。——朴初注
    访问埃及古都洛克沙月夜尼罗河上泛舟
                                      郭沫若
    市静人初定，天高月正圆。古祠群柱立，轻舸一帆悬。袅袅歌声发，琮琮浪语传。尼罗河上夜，上下六千年。
    月夜度沙漠和郭沫若先生　赵朴初
    大漠成银海、清光照满天。艰难思老马，辽阔谢飞船。已见乾坤转，能教陵谷迁，清溪流到处，荷叶自田田。
    和郭老洛克沙月夜之作　赵朴初
    诗思起遥天，当头月又圆。应怀千载想，不负一轮悬。古墓民魂活，残碑火种传。眼观未来世，身入太初年。
    洛克沙古代文物极为丰富。三四千年前祠墓、建筑宏丽，壁画雕刻，甚多精美。石碑上象形文字，为研究古埃及重要史料。
    过布达佩斯夜宿多瑙河上
                          赵朴初
    竞羡天蓝好，今过多瑙河。古碉纷倒影，深意一回波。十月风云换，今宵月色多。魔氛看净洗，喜气发清歌。
