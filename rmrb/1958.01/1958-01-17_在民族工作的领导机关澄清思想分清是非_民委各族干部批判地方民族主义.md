    Clarifying Thoughts and Distinguishing Right from Wrong in the Leading Organs of Ethnic Work
    Cadres of All Nationalities in the Nationalities Affairs Commission Criticize Local Nationalism

    (Our Dispatch) The Central Nationalities Affairs Commission and its subordinate units, on the basis of the victory of the general rectification stage, have launched a critique of local nationalism. At the beginning of the critique of local nationalism, Liu Chun, Vice-Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, made a mobilization report to all cadres.

    In his report, Liu Chun said: Since most of the minority nationalities have basically achieved the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, local nationalism has developed anew among the minority nationalities, and has become a dangerous trend that deserves serious vigilance. The manifestations of local nationalism are multifaceted, the most serious of which are: 1. Separatism against the motherland. Right-wing elements and nationalists among the minority nationalities slander the basic policy of national regional autonomy as being unable to solve China's national problems. They oppose the unified family of the motherland and attempt to separate from it. 2. Opposition to the Chinese Communist Party. They oppose the unity and solidarity of the working-class party and the principles of communism, attempting to organize local Party committees according to the ethnic composition of Party members, arrange Party leaders, and split the Party organization. 3. Opposition to socialism. They emphasize that everything old in the minority nationalities should remain unchanged; they oppose mutual contact and influence between nationalities and the acceptance of new things, as well as any phenomenon of mutual integration between nationalities arising therefrom. They oppose all the work carried out by the Party and the state in minority nationality areas, including the construction of large-scale industries, the construction of railways, and the training of the working class, intellectuals, and cadres. In particular, they oppose the socialist revolution and democratic reform, as well as the help given by the Han nationality to the minority nationalities and their participation in production and work in the minority nationality areas.

    Liu Chun pointed out: Nationalism is an important aspect of bourgeois ideology, incompatible with socialism and also incompatible with patriotism. It is worth noting that the reactionary remarks of right-wingers and nationalists in minority nationalities have influenced some minority nationality Party members, cadres, and even responsible Party cadres. Because these comrades have not yet stood firm on the proletarian stand and lack a correct view of nationality, they still have incorrect national feelings in their thinking, and often place national interests above class interests. It is easy to stir up national prejudices among such people.

    When talking about the important significance of the Nationalities Affairs Commission launching a critique of local nationalism, Liu Chun said: There are many cadres of all nationalities in the organs of the Nationalities Affairs Commission. According to the situation of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, local nationalism has undoubtedly grown in some minority nationality cadres, and some are very prominent, which cannot be ignored. Liu Chun said that in order to distinguish between major rights and wrongs on the national question, correct the ideological understanding of cadres, improve our work, give play to the socialist enthusiasm of cadres of all nationalities, and prepare ideologically for the transfer of cadres in the next stage, it is very necessary to conduct a universal and in-depth critique of local nationalism in the organs of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, which is an important part of the rectification movement in the Nationalities Affairs Commission.

    Liu Chun pointed out: The critique of local nationalism must be carried out resolutely, but local nationalism must be distinguished from those who have some incorrect national feelings. In particular, we must pay attention not to regard the deviations in understanding and certain confused thoughts that occur in actual work as local nationalism for criticism. However, incorrect national feelings, deviations in understanding and confused thoughts should also be criticized and educated. In his report, Liu Chun asked cadres of all nationalities to resolutely criticize local nationalist ideas and conduct self-education through this rectification movement. At the same time, he asked Han nationality cadres to examine their incorrect views on national issues, and overcome the work style of ideological backwardness and detachment from reality in national work.

    After listening to Liu Chun's mobilization report and studying relevant documents, the Nationalities Affairs Commission and its subordinate units, in accordance with the principle of "universal education, key criticism, relying on minority nationality backbones," from December 27, 1957, through forms such as the Great Blooming and Great Contending, writing big-character posters, and holding forums, first examined and criticized the shortcomings and errors reflected in the work of the various units of the Nationalities Affairs Commission. Then, ideological examination and criticism were launched among the cadres. Cadres of all minority nationalities strictly criticized the reactionary fallacies of right-wing elements and nationalists in minority nationalities who opposed the motherland, opposed the Party, and opposed socialism; and examined and criticized their own local nationalist thoughts and feelings, expressing their willingness to humbly accept the help of comrades of other nationalities.

    From the situation of this examination and criticism, some Uyghur cadres have the idea of ​​establishing an independent country or a federal republic, opposing the name of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and wanting to change it to "Uyghuristan." Some Tibetan cadres have proposed to establish a large Tibetan Autonomous Region. Some Mongolian cadres, under the pretext of being afraid of being "assimilated," opposed the joint establishment of agricultural production cooperatives by farmers of all nationalities, and even opposed the establishment of the steel industry in Baotou and the construction of the Jining-Erlian railway by the state, distorting the work carried out by the state to help and promote the development and prosperity of minority nationalities as "artificial, conscious, and accelerated assimilation." Some Yi people took the reactionary standpoint of slave owners against democratic reforms, and described the riots in the Liangshan Yi area where slave owners sabotaged the democratic reform movement as "caused by the mistakes of cadres"; The necessary armed strikes taken by the people's government against armed rebels who resolutely opposed the people in order to safeguard the interests of the people were described as "national struggles." Koreans have extremely wrong views on the motherland, and some even say that Koreans have three motherlands. Some Hui cadres described the rules and doctrines of Islam as customs and habits of the Hui nationality, and attempted to force everyone to follow them. Even living in the same dormitory, they had to build sheds and dig doors separately to isolate themselves from other households. In addition, some other minority nationality cadres also have varying degrees of local nationalist ideas.

    Han nationality cadres also examined that they did not have enough understanding and in-depth understanding of the Party's policies and principles in national work, and lacked the spirit of studying professional work; therefore, they caused ideological backwardness in their work compared to the development situation, or exceeded the objective reality.

    As of January 13, the general examination and criticism in the organs of the Nationalities Affairs Commission had basically come to an end. After this examination and criticism, the class consciousness of cadres of all nationalities has been improved, and their understanding of the unity of the motherland and domestic ethnic relations, as well as their understanding of ethnic policies, has also been improved, and the brotherly friendship between cadres has become closer. In-depth criticism is now being carried out on several major issues and key targets.

    在民族工作的领导机关澄清思想分清是非
    民委各族干部批判地方民族主义
    本报讯　中央民族事务委员会及其所属单位，在一般整改阶段的胜利基础上，展开了对地方民族主义的批判。在批判地方民族主义开始时，民族事务委员会副主任刘春向全体干部作了动员报告。
    刘春在报告中说：自从少数民族绝大部分基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，在少数民族中，地方民族主义有了新的滋长，并且已经成为一种值得严重警惕的危险。地方民族主义的表现是多方面的，最严重的是：一、反对祖国的分离主义。少数民族中的右派分子和民族主义者，污蔑民族区域自治这一基本政策不能解决中国民族问题。反对祖国统一的大家庭，企图分离出去。二、反对中国共产党。反对工人阶级政党的统一、团结和共产主义原则，企图按照党员的民族成分来组织地方的党委，安排党的负责人，分裂党的组织。三、反对社会主义。强调少数民族旧有的一切都应该原封不动；反对各民族互相接近，互相影响和接受新事物，以及由此而产生的民族间任何互相溶合的现象，反对党和国家在少数民族地区进行的一切工作，包括建设大工业、修铁路、培养工人阶级、知识分子和干部等。特别反对社会主义革命和民主改革，以及汉族对少数民族的帮助和到少数民族地区去参加生产和工作。
    刘春指出：民族主义是资产阶级思想的一个重要方面，同社会主义不相容，同爱国主义也不相容。值得警惕的是少数民族中的右派和民族主义者的反动言论，在一些少数民族党员干部甚至是党员负责干部中也有影响。因为这些同志还没有站稳无产阶级立场，缺乏正确的民族观，在他们的思想中还有不正确的民族感情，常常把民族利益放在阶级利益之上，对于这样的人很容易煽起民族偏见。
    刘春在谈到民族事务委员会展开批判地方民族主义的重要意义时说：在民委机关里，有着不少的各民族干部。根据大鸣大放的情况来看，在某些少数民族干部中地方民族主义无疑的也有了滋长，有的还很突出，这种情况决不能忽视。刘春说，为了在民族问题上分清大是大非，端正干部的思想认识，改进我们的工作，发挥各民族干部的社会主义积极性，并为下一阶段下放干部做好思想准备，在民委机关中普遍、深入地批判地方民族主义是很必要的，是民委进行整风运动的重要内容之一。
    刘春指出：批判地方民族主义必须坚决进行，又必须把地方民族主义同具有某种不正确的民族感情的人加以区别，特别注意不要把那些在实际工作中发生的认识上的偏差和某些糊涂思想，当作地方民族主义去批判。但对于错误的民族感情，认识上的偏差和糊涂思想也应该批评和教育。刘春在报告中要求各民族干部坚决批判地方民族主义思想，通过这次整风运动进行自我教育。同时要求汉族干部也要检查对民族问题的不正确看法，克服在民族工作中思想落后于客观形势和脱离实际的作风。
    民族事务委员会及所属单位听了刘春的动员报告及学习了有关文件后，根据“普遍教育、重点批判、依靠少数民族骨干”的方针，由1957年12月27日起，通过大鸣大放、写大字报、开座谈会等形式，首先检查和批评了民委机关各单位工作中反映出来的缺点和错误。然后在干部中展开思想检查和批判。各少数民族干部对少数民族中的右派分子和民族主义者反对祖国、反对党、反对社会主义的反动谬论作了严格的批判；并检查和批判了自己的地方民族主义思想情绪，表示虚心接受其他民族同志的帮助。
    从这次检查批判的情况来看，维吾尔族干部中有些人有搞独立国或者联邦共和国的思想，反对新疆维吾尔自治区的名称，要改为“维吾尔斯坦”。藏族干部中有的人提出要搞大藏族自治区。蒙古族干部中有人借口怕被“同化”，反对各民族农民联合建立农业生产合作社，甚至反对国家在包头建立钢铁工业和修筑集二铁路，把国家帮助和促进少数民族发展繁荣所进行的工作，曲解为“人为的，有意识的，加速的同化”。彝族中有人对进行民主改革持着奴隶主的反动立场，对在凉山彝族地区奴隶主破坏民主改革运动的骚乱事件说成是“干部的错误造成的”；把人民政府为了维护人民群众的利益对坚决与人民为敌的武装叛乱分子采取必要的武装打击，说成是“民族斗争”。朝鲜族中对祖国有极端错误的看法，甚至有人说朝鲜族有三个祖国。回族干部中有人把伊斯兰教中的教规教义都说成是回族的风俗习惯，并且企图强制一切人都要遵行。住在同一个宿舍中也要另搭棚凿门和其他住户隔离开来。此外，其他一些少数民族干部中也存在着不同程度的地方民族主义思想。
    汉族干部也检查了对党在民族工作方面的政策、方针体会不够，深入了解不够，钻研业务的精神不够；因此，造成工作中思想落后于发展形势，或者超过了客观实际情况。
    到1月13日止，民委机关一般的检查批判已基本上告一段落。经过这一次的检查和批判，各民族干部的阶级觉悟提高了，对祖国的统一和国内民族关系的认识以及对民族政策的了解也有了提高，干部之间的兄弟友谊更加亲密了。现正在对若干重大问题和重点对象进行深入批判。
