Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th -机关干部in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, recently used voluntary labor to build a reservoir for farmers. This reservoir can irrigate more than 11,000 mu of land in dozens of agricultural cooperatives. It has now begun to intercept the winter surplus water from the Qilian Mountains and can be used this spring.
    机关干部at the county level in Yongchang County, from the county party secretary and county head to correspondents, participated in the construction of this reservoir. The dam of the reservoir, which is 2.5 meters high, 4 meters wide, and 320 meters long, is entirely built of stone. There were no stones on the construction site, so the 机关干部劈took more than 3,700 cubic meters of stones from a nearby stone mountain, piece by piece, to build the dam.
    The 机关干部at the county level in Yongchang County have also recently donated more than 11,000 yuan for agricultural capital construction and have given 7,000 carts of fertilizer to agricultural cooperatives. Many 机关干部have also put forward plans to help farmers cultivate the land and accumulate fertilizer for farmers.
    Since May 1957, all the 机关单位in Yongchang County have established a system for 干部to participate in physical labor and have consistently implemented it. Now, a love of labor has become widespread among the 机关干部in this county, and each 干部has purchased his own labor tools. Each 干部also has a labor manual, and after participating in labor, they record their labor time in it.

    永昌县机关干部用义务劳动
    为农民修建了一个水库
    新华社兰州6日电　甘肃永昌县的机关干部最近用义务劳动为农民兴修了一个水库。这个水库可以使几十个农业社的一万一千多亩地得到灌溉。它现在已经开始拦蓄祁连山的冬季余水，今年春季就可以使用。
    永昌县级机关，从县委书记、县长到通讯员，都参加了这个水库的修建。水库的高二点五公尺、宽四公尺、长达三百二十公尺的堤坝，完全是用石块筑成的。工地上没有石块，机关干部们就从附近的一座石山上一块一块地劈下了三千七百多立方公尺，来筑成这个堤坝。
    永昌县级机关的干部最近还为农民捐献了一万一千多元的农业基本建设费用，向农业社赠送了七千车肥料，许多机关干部还提出了帮助农民整地和为农民积肥的计划。
    永昌县各机关单位从1957年5月开始，建立了干部参加体力劳动的制度，一直坚持执行。现在热爱劳动的风尚已在这个县的机关干部中普遍形成，每个干部自己都购置了劳动工具。每个干部还有一本劳动手册，参加劳动以后，就将自己的劳动时间数字记在上面。
