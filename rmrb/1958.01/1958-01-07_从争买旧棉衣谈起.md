    Starting with the Scramble to Buy Old Cotton Clothes
    Yang Zhifu, Ministry of Metallurgical Industry

    The ministry, in order to take care of us comrades going to the countryside, specially ordered a batch of old cotton clothes. Everyone rushed to buy them upon hearing the news. With more people than clothes, the old cotton clothes became treasures. Little Liu arrived late and didn't get one. He sighed in disappointment, looking at the old cotton clothes: "Alas, these old cotton clothes, I wouldn't have wanted them even if they were given to me in the past..."

    Little Liu spoke the truth, and at the same time, he talked about the changes in the lives of us intellectuals in recent years. Take myself for example. I remember when I was in middle school, I could still wear some coarse cloth clothes and eat simple meals, but after entering university, I felt that wearing those old clothes seemed a bit shabby. I always wanted to buy some new clothes like student blue or gabardine to show off. After graduating and being assigned to work as a translator in Beijing, I always thought that I would be in contact with experts frequently, and wearing old clothes would be unsightly, so I spent my entire first month's salary on clothes. Later, I bought a woolen pants, but still didn't get my wish. I complained that if I didn't have family burdens, watches, bicycles, fabric clothes, and satin quilts would probably have been complete long ago. …

    This is enough to illustrate that my bourgeois thinking of being greedy for enjoyment and admiring vanity has been growing in recent years. Now that the Party is calling on us to go to the countryside to labor and temper ourselves, and to thoroughly transform ourselves, this is truly a timely refreshing medicine for me. I am honored to have been approved to go to the countryside in the first batch. These days, I am busy packing my luggage, and I opened the old clothes that had been pressed at the bottom of the box for many years. My feelings are completely different from before. Every old garment seems to be shining brightly at me. Wearing them not only feels warm, but also feels intimate and lovely.

    从争买旧棉衣谈起
    冶金工业部　杨直夫
    部里为了照顾我们下乡同志，特去订购了一批旧棉衣。大家闻讯争购，人多衣少，旧棉衣简直成了珍宝。小刘晚来了一步，没买到手，望着旧棉衣失望地长叹了一声：“唉，这些旧棉衣过去奉送给我，我也不要……”
    小刘说出了实话，同时也谈出了我们这些知识分子近年来的生活变化。就以我来说吧，记得我在中学时还能穿些粗布衣服，吃些粗茶淡饭，但是考入大学后，就觉得再穿那些旧衣服似乎有些寒酸，总想买些学生蓝、华达呢之类的新衣来装装门面。毕业后分配来北京作翻译工作，那时总以为要经常与专家接触，穿得旧了有碍观瞻，曾把第一个月的全部工资都买了衣服。后来，又买了一条呢子裤，但仍未遂心愿，自怨如果我没有家庭负担的话，手表、自行车、料子服、缎子被恐怕早已样样齐全了。……
    这些已足够说明我这几年来贪图享受、羡慕虚荣的资产阶级思想在日益滋长。现在党号召我们下乡劳动锻炼，彻底改造自己，这对于我真是一服适时的清凉剂。我荣幸地被批准第一批下乡。这几天我忙于整理行装，翻开了压在箱底多年的旧衣服，观感与从前迥然不同，件件旧衣似乎在向着我闪闪发光。穿起来不仅暖和，而且觉得亲切可爱。
