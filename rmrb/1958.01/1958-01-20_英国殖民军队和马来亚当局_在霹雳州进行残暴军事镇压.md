Xinhua News Agency, January 18th, Kuala Lumpur dispatch: British military authorities and the Federation of Malaya authorities began a military operation on the 16th in a vast area of Perak state to suppress the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army, while also implementing strict control measures on residents.

A full brigade of Commonwealth troops, composed of British and Australian soldiers, along with Malayan police forces, totaling more than 10,000 people, participated in this large-scale military suppression operation.

Prior to this, Chen Ping, the General Secretary of the Malayan Communist Party, had repeatedly requested to end the Malayan war through negotiations and had put forward further suggestions for holding preliminary talks, but these were rejected by the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman.

In recent days, Commonwealth troops have used artillery to bombard some areas in Batu Gajah, Sungei Siput and other regions. Malayan police arrested fifty-one residents in the area who were considered suspicious, many of whom were women.

According to Malayan newspapers, on the 16th, the Federation of Malaya authorities began implementing martial law in Sungei Siput, Ulu Kinta, South Kinta, and the southwest area of Parit, east of the Perak River in Perak state, and implemented the largest-scale food control measures since the "Emergency Ordinance" was promulgated in 1948. The affected area totals 1,660 square miles, and the affected population is 245,000.

    据新华社18日讯　据吉隆坡消息：英国军事当局和马来亚联合邦当局16日开始在霹雳州一个广大地区展开了镇压马来亚共产党和马来亚民族解放军的军事行动，同时还对居民施行严厉的管制措施。
    由英国兵和澳大利亚兵等组成的整整一旅的英联邦军队以及马来亚的警察部队等合计一万多人，参加这一次大规模的军事镇压行动。
    在这以前，马来亚共产党总书记陈平曾经一再要求通过谈判来结束马来亚的战争，并且提出了举行初步谈判的进一步建议，但是，遭到了马来亚联合邦总理拉赫曼的拒绝。
