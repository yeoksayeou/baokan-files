Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th – Shaanxi Province is taking measures to organize a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural technology reform with revolutionary spirit.

    Recently, a large-scale propaganda campaign has been launched throughout the province. Five "Agricultural Technology Teaching Groups" composed of forty-four agricultural model workers and eleven agricultural scientific and technical personnel, went to northern Shaanxi and Guanzhong areas on the 15th to teach. According to the plan, this year two million farmers across the province will directly receive instruction in advanced agricultural technology, and ten million person-times will receive general scientific and technological knowledge propaganda. Xi'an City will also build a new agricultural exhibition hall to exchange advanced experience in agricultural production.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Association for Science Popularization plans to organize a core team of propaganda and popularization of agricultural science and technology from the 100,000 middle and primary school graduates who returned to their hometowns to engage in production last year and the 60,000 cadres who were transferred to lower levels. It has also been decided to add content on scientific and technological knowledge to the teaching in 140 cultural centers, more than 12,000 rural clubs, and literacy studies with four million participants across the province.

    A large number of scientific and technical personnel have left classrooms and laboratories to go to the mountains and the countryside and cultivate experimental fields in agricultural cooperatives. Four scientific working teams composed of some teachers from Northwest Agricultural College, the Department of Water Conservancy of Jiaotong University (Xi'an Branch), and other agricultural scientific research personnel have been engaged in investigation and research on water conservancy, agriculture, and animal husbandry in mountainous areas or rural areas. Soon, two other comprehensive scientific and technological survey teams composed of agricultural scientists will also set off to work in mountainous areas. The technical personnel of agricultural technology promotion stations throughout the province have launched a universal movement to cultivate experimental fields. The 370 agricultural technical cadres in Hanzhong Prefecture are all preparing to establish experimental fields and guarantee that the yield will increase by more than 50% compared with local general crops.

    The practical experience of agricultural technology reform in Shaanxi Province in recent years has proved that as long as the mass line can be implemented, a leap forward in technological reform is entirely possible. For example, when promoting the improved wheat variety Bima No. 1, due to the firm reliance on the strength of the masses, the planting area in the province has developed from more than three million mu to more than seventeen million mu in just eight years, and the increased wheat production has reached more than 2.4 billion jin. By mobilizing the masses to prevent and control insect pests, the damage of devastating pests such as wheat bugs has been basically controlled in the past five years, and 370 million jin of grain have been protected. However, some technical cadres often do not believe in the power and wisdom of the masses, are very poor at cultivating and promoting advanced experience, and lack confidence and perseverance in technical reform, which has affected the rapid development of agricultural production in the province.

    At present, with the leap forward in agricultural production and the arrival of machinery in the countryside, a series of agricultural technology problems urgently need to be solved, such as the water conservancy projects going up the mountains and ridges and the establishment of small hydropower stations in the water conservancy movement, the comprehensive development of mountainous areas, the selection and breeding of improved varieties of double-cropping and miscellaneous grain crops, soil and water conservation and fertilizer accumulation, and the use of agricultural machinery and other important technical issues. In order to make agricultural technology keep up with the needs of agricultural production development, the relevant departments of Shaanxi Province recently convened science popularization and science association symposiums, agricultural technology conferences, and water conservancy, cotton, and other conferences, and decided to take various measures to carry out a revolution in agricultural technology.

### 农业技术改革也要大跃进  陕西省科学技术人员下乡上山培育试验田  讲授组下乡讲学大规模普及农业科学技术

    农业技术改革也要大跃进

    讲授组下乡讲学大规模普及农业科学技术
    新华社西安19日电　陕西省正在采取措施，以革命精神组织农业技术改革工作全面跃进。
    最近，规模宏大的宣传工作，已在全省范围内初步展开。由四十四名农业丰产模范和十一名农业科学技术人员组成的五个“农业技术传授组”，15日分别到陕北和关中一带讲学。按照计划，今年全省将有二百万农民直接受到先进农业技术的传授；受到一般科学技术知识宣传的将达一千万人次。西安市还将新建一座农业展览馆，以交流农业生产先进经验。
    陕西省科学普及协会准备在去年回乡生产的十万名中、小学毕业生和下放的六万名干部中，组织一支宣传普及农业科学技术的骨干队伍。还决定在全省一百四十个文化馆、一万二千多个农村俱乐部和有四百万人参加的扫盲学习中，增加讲授科学技术知识的内容。
    大批科学技术人员纷纷走出课堂和研究室，上山下乡和到农业社培育试验田。西北农学院、交通大学（西安部分）水利系等高等学校部分教师和其他农业科学研究人员等组成的四支科学工作队伍，已经在山区或乡间从事水利、农业和畜牧方面的考察研究工作。不久，另外两支由农业科学家们组成的综合科学技术调查队也将出发到山区去工作。全省各农业技术推广站的技术人员已发起普遍培植试验田的运动，汉中专区三百七十名农业技术干部，人人准备建立试验田，并保证产量比当地一般作物增产50％以上。
    几年来，陕西省农业技术改革的实践经验证明，只要能贯彻群众路线，技术改革上的跃进是完全可能的。例如，推广良种小麦碧蚂一号时，由于坚决依靠群众力量，在短短八年中全省种植面积已从三百多万亩发展到一千七百多万亩，增产的小麦达二十四亿多斤。由于发动群众进行防治虫害，五年来已基本控制小麦吸浆虫等毁灭性病虫的危害，保产粮食达三亿七千多万斤。但是也有些技术干部常常不相信群众的力量和智慧，培养和推广先进经验很差，对技术改革缺乏信心和毅力，影响了全省农业生产的迅速发展。
    目前，随着农业生产的跃进和机械下乡，出现了一系列农业技术上极待解决的问题，如兴修水利运动中出现的水利上山上塬和建立小型水力发电站、综合开发山区、复种和杂粮作物良种的选育、水土保持和积肥、农业机械的使用等重要技术问题。为了使农业技术跟上农业生产发展的需要，陕西省有关部门最近召开了科普、科联座谈会，农业技术会和水利、棉花等会议，决定采取各种措施进行农业技术上的革命。
