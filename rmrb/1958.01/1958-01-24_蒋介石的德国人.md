	"Chiang Kai-shek's Germans"
	By Our Staff Commentator

	A West German parliamentary delegation led by the Vice President of the West German Federal Parliament, Richard Jaeger, visited Taiwan, the Chinese territory currently occupied by American imperialism and its puppet Chiang Kai-shek clique, on January 6th. The main members of this delegation were parliamentarians from the Adenauer government's ruling party, including six members of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union and two members of the German Party. Buch, an employee of the West German government's holding company, also accompanied the delegation. These Bonn parliamentarians announced that the purpose of their visit to Taiwan was to strengthen cooperation, develop economic and cultural relations between West Germany and Taiwan, and to study the possibility of West German investment in Taiwan. After arriving in Taiwan, in addition to expressing active support for the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which had long been spurned by the Chinese people, they also inspected Jinmen, our coastal island occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army, to boost "morale."

	It is quite clear that the activities of this small group of Bonn parliamentarians in Taiwan are extremely unfriendly and hostile actions toward the People's Republic of China, but these actions have received the support and encouragement of certain anti-China forces within the West German ruling group. They not only attempt to obstruct and undermine the traditional friendship and growing economic and cultural relations between the West German and Chinese people, but also openly support the American imperialist conspiracy to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and create so-called "two Chinas" in order to maintain tension in the Far East and the world. Although the West German Foreign Ministry says "this is entirely a private visit," judging from the personnel involved in the activities in Taiwan, eight of the parliamentarians are members of the ruling party of the Federal Government, and mainly members of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union. Isn't the background obvious?

	It should be pointed out that this policy of hostility towards China and pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States completely violates the desire of the Chinese and West German people to promote friendly relations between the two sides, and is also incompatible with the interests of the entire German people in demanding the easing of international tensions and striving for the peaceful reunification of their country. Because the powerful existence and growing development of New China is a fact that no force can change. American imperialism knows that its plan to support Taiwan's attack on the mainland in order to regain its rule over China has completely and forever failed, and that the Chinese people will surely recover Taiwan is also certain. Therefore, despite American pressure to obstruct recognition of China, the world trend is that the number of countries recognizing China will increase day by day, and no one can stop this trend, so the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the United States. Since the United States cannot overthrow New China and cannot change the world trend, in order to continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, it is now turning to attempt to create "two Chinas" internationally, so that Taiwan can break away from the motherland and become "independent," and to legitimize its armed occupation of Taiwan. To this end, the United States is actively recruiting certain countries and some politicians to carry out conspiratorial activities for its "two Chinas" policy. It is not difficult to see that the visit of some West German parliamentarians to Taiwan is being carried out against the above background. It is inevitable that it will arouse the resolute opposition of the Chinese people. American imperialism wants to create "two Chinas" in order to permanently occupy Taiwan and obstruct the easing of tensions in the Far East and the world. This is something that the Chinese people will never allow, and it is also something that all peace-loving people in the world resolutely oppose. The fact is very clear that supporting the American policy of creating "two Chinas" is not only not conducive to the easing of international tensions, but also not conducive to the German people's efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany, but rather is conducive to the American imperialist conspiracy to permanently divide Germany, and is therefore resolutely opposed by the German people. As for these West German parliamentarians' plans to carry out so-called investment in China's territory of Taiwan against the will of the People's Republic of China government, which is the only representative of the Chinese people, it is of course illegal and will not be recognized by the Chinese government.

	In short, the hostile actions of a group of West German parliamentarians visiting Taiwan not only harm the friendly relations between the Chinese and West German people, but also bring no benefit to West Germany itself. As the West German Social Democratic Party correctly pointed out, the visit of these "Chiang Kai-shek's Germans" to Taiwan "will not only be seen as a provocation to China, which has a population of 600 million, but also as a provocation to the people and governments of many countries in Asia," and support for the Chiang Kai-shek government, which is "in the shadow of world politics," "will certainly not receive any sympathy from us." We believe that any West German politician with a sense of reality will not sympathize with this anti-China activity. The Chinese people are willing to work with the West German people to oppose this activity that poisons the friendly relations between the people of the two countries and creates international tension.

    “蒋介石的德国人”
    本报评论员
    一个由西德联邦议院副议长理夏德·耶格尔率领的西德议员访问团1月6日前往现被美帝国主义和它的傀儡蒋介石集团所盘踞的中国领土台湾进行了访问。这个访问团的主要成员都是阿登纳政府执政党的议员，其中六人是阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的议员，二人是德意志党的议员，西德政府的控股公司人员布赫也随同该团前往访问。这些波恩议员宣布他们访问台湾的目的是要加强西德同台湾之间的合作，发展经济和文化关系，以及研究西德在台湾进行投资的可能性。他们到达台湾之后，除了对早被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团表示了积极的支持外，还到蒋介石军队盘踞的我国沿海岛屿金门进行视察，鼓舞“士气”。
    十分明白，这一小撮波恩议员访台的活动是对中华人民共和国极不友好和充满了敌意的行动，可是这种行动却得到了西德统治集团中某些敌视中国的势力的支持和鼓励。他们不但企图极力阻挠和破坏西德人民同中国人民的传统友谊和日益发展的经济、文化关系，而且公然不讳地支持美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾和制造所谓“两个中国”。以便保持远东和世界紧张局势的阴谋。尽管西德外交部说“这完全是私人性质的访问”，但是从这批到台湾活动的人员看，八个议员都是联邦政府执政党的议员，而且主要是阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的议员，其背景不是昭然若揭吗？
    应该指出，这种敌视中国、替美国火中取栗的政策完全有背于中国和西德人民促进双方友好关系的愿望，也是同全体德国人民要求和缓国际局势和争取祖国的和平统一的利益不相容的。因为新中国的强大存在和日益发展是任何力量都无法改变的事实。美帝国主义知道支持台湾进攻大陆以便它重新统治中国的计划是彻底地、永远地破产了，而中国人民必将收复台湾，也是确定不移的。因此尽管美国施加压力，阻挠对中国的承认，但世界的趋势是：承认中国的国家必将一天比一天增加，这个趋势谁也无法阻止，因而形势对美国愈来愈不利了。美国既然无法推翻新中国，无法改变世界的趋势，为了继续霸占中国领土台湾，它现在就转而企图在国际上制造“两个中国”，使台湾脱离祖国“独立”，使它对台湾的武装占领合法化。为此目的，美国正积极招募某些国家和一些政客为它的“两个中国”政策进行阴谋活动。不难看出，若干西德议员访问台湾的活动，正是在上述背景下进行的。它之引起中国人民的坚决反对是必然的。美帝国主义要制造“两个中国”以便永远霸占台湾，阻挠远东和世界紧张局势的和缓，这是中国人民决不允许的，也是世界一切爱好和平的人民所坚决反对的。事实很明显，支持美国制造“两个中国”的政策，不但不利于国际紧张局势的和缓，同时也不利于德国人民争取德国和平统一的努力，反而恰恰有利于美帝国主义永远分裂德国的阴谋，因此也是德国人民所坚决反对的。至于这些西德议员打算违反唯一代表中国人民的中华人民共和国政府的意志在中国领土台湾进行所谓投资，当然是非法的，不会得到中国政府的承认。
    总之，一批西德议员访问台湾的敌意行动，不但有损于中国和西德人民之间的友好关系，而且对西德本身也不会带来任何好处。正如西德社会民主党所正确地指出的，这些“蒋介石的德国人”访问台湾，“不仅将被看成是对拥有六亿人口的中国的挑衅，而且也会被看成是对亚洲许多国家的人民和政府的挑衅”，对“处在世界政治阴影中”的蒋介石政府的支持，“肯定地不会得到我们的任何同情”。我们相信，任何具有现实感的西德政治家都不会同情这种敌视中国的活动。中国人民愿意同西德人民一道反对这种毒化两国人民友好关系和制造国际紧张局势的活动。
