To reflect the extraordinary anti-Rightist struggle, playwrights have enthusiastically written many scripts. The "Fighting Sunday," "Higher Garbage," and "Huang Tan Visits Prison," currently being performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater, are examples of one-act comedies on different themes and in different styles about the anti-Rightist movement. Among them, "Oh Dear, the American Little Moon," is a script co-written by Chen Baichen, Liu Canglang, Wang Mingfu, and Huang Ti. Taking the U.S. leaders' delusion of sending a pitiful "little moon" into the sky as the subject, they use satirical strokes to vividly expose the decadent social system of the United States.

The different styles of the four skits determine the richness and diversity of their performance forms. "Fighting Sunday" and "Higher Garbage" are full of light and lively comedic atmosphere. "Huang Tan Visits Prison" adopts a combination of ancient opera and cartoons in its stage management, highlighting its characteristics. The performance of "Oh Dear, the American Little Moon" is a series of cartoon-like whimsical scenes. In the arrangement of directors and actors, it also changed the past practice of mostly young actors performing in skits, with famous actors such as Ye Zi, Diao Guangqin, Fang Guande, and Zhu Lin taking on major roles.

    四出反右时事小戏
    剧作家为了反映不平凡的反右派斗争，热情地写出了不少剧本。北京人民艺术剧院正在公演的“战斗的星期天”、“高等垃圾”和“黄谭探监”，就是不同题材、风格的反右时事独幕喜剧。其中“哎呀呀，美国小月亮”，则是陈白尘、刘沧浪、王命夫和黄悌合写的剧本。他们以美国首脑们妄想把可怜的“小月亮”送上天去为题材，用讽刺的笔触形象地揭露了美国腐朽的社会制度。
    四出小戏的不同风格，决定了它们演出形式的丰富多彩。“战斗的星期天”、“高等垃圾”充满轻松明快的喜剧气氛，“黄谭探监”采用了古装戏和漫画相结合的形式调度着场面，突出了它的特点。“哎呀呀，美国小月亮”的演出，是一连串卡通片似的奇趣场面。在导演和演员力量的安排上，也改变了过去多是青年演员演小戏的作法，名演员如叶子、刁光覃、方琯德、朱琳等都担任了主要角色。
