The bugle of battle has sounded!
Guangning County to afforest all barren mountains this year

    (Our dispatch) According to a *Southern Daily* report: Guangning County, Guangdong Province, which has already basically achieved afforestation, is now, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and the revolutionary heroic spirit of overturning rivers and seas, bravely advancing towards the mountains, planning to plant 200,000 mu of trees this year, afforest all barren mountains, comprehensively cultivate bamboo forests and oil-tea forests, and renew the existing remnant forests. It aims to expand the existing 110,000 mu of oil-tea forests to 800,000 mu within ten years, and turn it into the province's oil-tea base in twelve years.

    The county's mountains account for 87% of the county's total area. Since 1951, the county has planted more than 456,000 mu of trees and renovated 190,000 mu of remnant forests. The afforestation in seven years is more than that in the two hundred years before liberation. These achievements have not made the farmers of Guangning County complacent. After the promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, it further inspired their confidence and determination to develop mountain areas and build mountain areas, resulting in unprecedented enthusiasm. At the Second Session of the First Congress of the Guangning County Committee of the Communist Party of China, which ended on December 23, 1957, based on this situation, a plan was made to build the economically and culturally backward mountain areas into progressive, prosperous, healthy, and happy mountain areas within ten years. After this bugle call of battle was sounded, the entire county mobilized 130,000 laborers (accounting for more than 90% of the county's labor force) and bravely threw themselves into the struggle to build and prosper the mountain areas.

    战斗的号角响了！
    广宁县今年绿化全部荒山
    本报讯　据南方日报消息：已经基本实现了绿化的广东省广宁县，现在又以愚公移山的精神和排山倒海的革命英雄气概，勇猛向山地进军，要在今年造林二十万亩，绿化全部荒山，全面抚育竹林和油茶林，将现有的残林更新，要在十年内从现在的十一万亩油茶林扩大到八十万亩，十二年后变成全省的油茶基地。
    这个县的山地占全县总面积87％，从1951年以来，全县造林四十五万六千多亩，整理残林十九万亩，七年造林比解放前二百年还要多，现在97％的山岭已是青葱翠绿。这些成绩并没有使广宁县的农民自满，全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，更进一步鼓舞了他们开发山区建设山区的信心和决心，出现了空前未有的干劲。在1957年12月23日结束的中共广宁县第一届代表大会第二次会议上，根据这种情况，作出了在十年内把经济、文化落后的山区建设成进步、繁荣、康乐、幸福的山区的规划。这个战斗的号角吹响以后，全县出动了十三万劳动大军（占全县劳动力90％以上）勇猛地投入建设山区繁荣山区的斗争。
