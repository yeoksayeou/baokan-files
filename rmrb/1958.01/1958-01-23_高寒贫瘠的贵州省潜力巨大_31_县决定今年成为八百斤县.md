Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st. Known for its high altitude and poverty, Guizhou Province has 31 counties and cities planning to achieve or exceed an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu this year, realizing the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. This was decided at the four-level cadre meetings of the counties (cities).

　　At the meeting, rural cadres at all levels in these counties (cities), through criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and exploring the production potential of mountainous areas in all aspects, believed that mountainous areas are rich in resources and have great potential. As long as they muster revolutionary spirit, it is entirely possible to achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu ahead of schedule. Therefore, the grain production increase plans formulated by the cadres attending the meeting from various counties based on the specific conditions of their counties have an average yield per mu that is 100 to 300 jin higher than last year. Among them, the suburbs of Zunyi City have the highest, planning to reach a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year; Shibing County, which had a grain yield of 577 jin per mu last year, is striving to increase production by 35% this year, reaching 890 jin.

　　Among these 31 counties (cities), although there are the suburbs of Guiyang and Zunyi, which have relatively flat terrain and fertile soil; more are remote mountainous areas and ethnic minority mountainous areas with relatively poor soil. Jiangkou County, the first to propose a competition for 800 jin of grain per mu in the province, is located in the Fanjing Mountain area of the Wuling Mountains and is a remote county in eastern Guizhou. Leishan, Taijiang, and other nine counties in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, where the Miaoling Mountains wind, are also striving to create an unprecedented record of 800 jin of grain per mu this year.

　　In order to ensure that mountainous areas with high altitude and barren soil can achieve or exceed the target of 800 jin of grain per mu like plain areas, these counties (cities) have formulated various production increase measures based on local conditions, focusing on soil and water conservation, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation. Tongren County, which is often affected by drought, plans to complete the water conservancy task of expanding the irrigated area by 50,000 mu before the Spring Festival, so that more than 85% of the paddy fields have a drought resistance capacity of 60 days; and it is necessary to apply an average of 13,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of field. Yinjiang County, located in a remote mountainous area, has decided to convert 110,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields in February. Xingyi County, which has a relatively mild climate in the south, plans to plant 100,000 mu of double-cropping rice this year, and also intercrop a season of corn in more than 10,000 mu of sugar cane and flue-cured tobacco fields. Jinsha County, in the western mountainous area, has decided to convert 90,000 mu of barren land and sloping soil into fertile soil and terraced fields this year. Jiangkou County, which increased production last year due to the promotion of triangular rice planting, plans to implement triangular planting in more than 70% of the rice this year; and use new-style plows for more than 70% of the cultivated land.

　　More than two-thirds of the cultivated land in Guizhou Province is on mountain slopes. In the past, the farming technology was quite backward, and it was a mountainous area with very low grain yield. Until 1952, the average yield per mu was only 271 jin. During the first five-year plan period, under the leadership of the Communist Party, farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas realized agricultural cooperation, which enabled them to implement a series of production increase measures, so that grain production increased year after year. In 1957, according to incomplete statistics, 104 townships and 990 agricultural cooperatives in the province created an advanced record of an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu in mountainous areas. Among the above-mentioned 31 counties (cities), some counties already had a yield of about 600 jin per mu last year.

### 高寒贫瘠的贵州省潜力巨大  31县决定今年成为八百斤县

    高寒贫瘠的贵州省潜力巨大
    31县决定今年成为八百斤县
    新华社贵阳21日电　以高寒贫瘠著称的贵州省，有三十一个县市计划今年粮食平均每亩产量达到或超过八百斤，提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的粮食增产指标。这是各县（市）四级干部会议讨论决定的。
    这些县（市）的各级农村干部在会上通过批判右倾保守思想，从各方面挖掘山区生产潜力后，都认为山区资源丰富，潜力巨大，只要鼓起革命干劲，提前实现亩产粮食八百斤是完全可能的。因此各县到会干部根据本县具体情况订出的今年粮食增产计划，平均每亩产量比去年高一百斤到三百斤。其中以遵义市郊区最高，今年计划达到亩产粮食一千斤；去年亩产粮食五百七十七斤的施秉县，今年争取增产35％，达到八百九十斤。
    在这三十一个县（市）中，虽然有地势较平坦、土壤较肥沃的贵阳、遵义两市的郊区；但更多的是土壤较贫瘦的边远山区和少数民族山区。第一个向全省倡议开展亩产粮食八百斤竞赛的江口县，就是处在武陵山脉的梵净山麓中，是贵州东部的一个边远县份。黔东南苗族侗族自治州内苗岭盘亘的雷山、台江等九县，也争取在今年创造亩产粮食八百斤的空前纪录。
    为了保证在地势高寒、土质瘠薄的山区，能像平原地区一样达到或超过亩产粮食八百斤的指标，这些县（市）都因地制宜地订出以做好水土保持、兴修水利和积肥为主的各项增产措施。经常受旱的铜仁县计划在春节前完成扩大灌溉面积五万亩的水利任务，使85％以上的稻田抗旱能力达六十天；并且要做到平均每亩田施肥一万三千斤。地处边远山区的印江县，决定在2月份内把十一万亩旱地变为水田。南部气候较温和的兴义县，今年计划种双季稻十万亩，还要在一万多亩甘蔗、烤烟地里间种一季玉米。西部山区里的金沙县，今年决定把九万亩瘦地、坡土改为肥土和梯田。去年由于推广水稻三角丛植获得增产的江口县，今年计划70％以上的水稻都实行三角丛植；并使70％以上的耕地都用新式犁翻犁。
    贵州省三分之二以上的耕地都在山坡上，以前耕作技术相当落后，是一个粮食产量很低的山区，直到1952年平均每亩产量只不过二百七十一斤。在第一个五年计划期间，山区各族农民在共产党领导下实现了农业合作化，才有能力推行一系列增产措施，使粮食产量连年提高。在1957年，据不完全统计，全省就有一百零四个乡和九百九十个农业社创造了山区平均亩产粮食八百斤的先进纪录。在上述三十一县（市）中，就有一部分县去年亩产已达六百斤左右。
