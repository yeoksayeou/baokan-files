Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 12th: This year, all industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union's entire machine-building industry, coal mining industry, cement, and non-ferrous metal industries will implement a seven-hour workday. This means that by the end of this year, most industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union will shorten their workday and work according to a seven-hour system. Only light industry, the food industry, the transportation sector, local industries, and several service industries will implement the seven-hour workday later.

The implementation of the seven-hour workday was proposed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and this work system is to be implemented gradually during the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). By the end of last year, some factories in Moscow, the Donbass Volyn coal mining area, more than 20% of enterprises in the ferrous metallurgy sector and the chemical industry sector, as well as hundreds of factories in the machine-building industry, had already implemented the seven-hour workday. Certain industries in these sectors that involve heavier labor or are detrimental to health have implemented a six-hour workday.

The principle of implementing a shorter workday system is to increase labor productivity without reducing workers' income. Therefore, various industrial enterprises have been preparing for more than half a year before transitioning to the seven-hour workday.

The Moscow Second Clock Factory, which was the first to implement the seven-hour workday, began preparing for the shorter workday in September 1956. All factory employees discussed production improvement issues for two months and put forward 940 rationalization proposals. After these suggestions were adopted, the factory's labor productivity increased by 18%, and each worker could complete the eight-hour production quota in seven hours. Thus, this factory comprehensively implemented the seven-hour workday in January 1957. The Kursk Rubber United Factory also implemented the seven-hour workday after taking measures to automate production processes and improve labor organization, thereby increasing labor productivity. Many factories regard the preparation process for transitioning to the seven-hour workday as a process of developing workers' production enthusiasm and increasing production. The preparation work at the Obukhov Lenin Textile Factory lasted for a year. During this year, workers thoroughly examined the shortcomings of wasted working hours and the failure to fully utilize the capacity of machinery and equipment, and improved the division of labor. As a result, the yarn factory's production increased by 36%, and the weaving factory's production increased by 11%.

Currently, a large number of industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union's machine-building, coal mining, and other industrial sectors are preparing for the implementation of the seven-hour workday system based on the experience of factories that have already implemented the seven-hour workday last year. Shortening the workday brings great benefits to the majority of workers, allowing them to have more time to study, rest, and take care of their families.

### 苏联更多职工将每天工作七小时  大部分工业企业今年内都要缩短工作日

    苏联更多职工将每天工作七小时
    大部分工业企业今年内都要缩短工作日
    新华社莫斯科12日电今年，苏联的整个机器制造业、煤矿工业、水泥、有色金属工业部门的全部工业企业都将实行七小时工作制。这就是说，到今年年底，苏联大部分的工业企业都要缩短工作日，按七小时工作制工作。只有轻工业、食品工业、交通部门、地方工业和若干服务性的行业要在较晚的时候才实行七小时工作制。
    实行七小时工作制是苏联共产党第二十次代表大会提出来的，这个工作制要在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间逐步实行。到去年年底，莫斯科的一些工厂、顿巴斯沃林煤矿区、黑色冶金部门和化学工业部门的20％以上的企业，以及机器制造业的几百个工厂都已经实行了七小时工作制。这些部门中某些劳动较繁重、对身体健康不利的行业则实行了六小时工作制。
    实行较短的工作日制度是以提高劳动生产率、不减少工人的劳动收入为原则的。所以，各个工业企业在过渡到七小时工作日之前，都做了半年以上的准备工作。
    最先实行七小时工作制的莫斯科第二钟表厂，从1956年9月起就为缩短工作日作了准备，全厂职工对改进生产问题讨论了两个月，提出了九百四十项合理化建议。这些建议被采用后，全厂劳动生产率提高了18％，每个工人都能在七小时内完成八小时的生产定额。这样，这个工厂就在1957年1月全面地实行了七小时工作制。库尔斯克橡胶联合厂也是在采取了使生产过程自动化和改善劳动组织的办法提高了劳动生产率之后，才实行七小时工作制的。许多工厂都把过渡到七小时工作日的准备过程看作是发挥工人生产积极性和提高生产的过程。像奥布霍夫列宁纺织厂的准备工作就进行了一年。在这一年中，工人们彻底地检查了浪费工时和机器设备能力未能充分利用的缺点，改进了劳动分工，结果，纱厂的生产增加了36％，织布厂的生产增加了11％。
    现在，苏联机器制造业和煤矿等工业部门的大批工业企业正在根据去年已经实行了七小时工作制的工厂的经验，为实行七小时工作日制度进行准备工作。缩短工作日给广大工人带来很大好处，工人们可以有更多的时间来学习、休息和照顾家庭。
