    Facts Refute the Skeptics
    There is a kind of "skeptic" who is suspicious of all reforms in agricultural production, always afraid to take a step forward. Even after they have plucked up their courage to take a step and have already received some benefits, they still think it is "luck" and stop moving forward. There are also people who have taken a few steps under the urging of others, but because of insufficient effort or unexpected difficulties, they have suffered some setbacks, and then, "once bitten by a snake for one year, they are afraid of eels for three years," and they dare not move forward boldly.
    Their doubts are often "based" on something. Some say that it has never been done this way before. Some say that someone here has done this before and failed. Some say that doing this is good, but the conditions here are not sufficient. In fact, these "bases" of theirs are outdated. The most fundamental point is: they have not truly recognized the power of the cooperative system, and have not adopted the attitude of a revolutionary to deal with natural conditions.
    The issue of planting double-cropping rice is like this. The "skeptics" hold on to reasons such as: insufficient manpower, insufficient water, insufficient fertilizer, and incorrect climate, etc. In the era of individual economy, these were indeed difficult problems to overcome. Now, the situation is very different. With unified allocation and flexible use of manpower and land resources, coupled with the improvement of basic construction and production tools under the support of the state and the working class, these difficulties cannot be overcome. The promotion of double-cropping rice in various places the year before last was very good, and the vast majority were successful. However, individual cases of failure scared some people, causing the "skeptics" to gain the upper hand in some places for a while. If this had not been the case, more grain would have been produced last year.
    The facts in Anqing Prefecture in Anhui and Songjiang Prefecture in Jiangsu all show that double-cropping rice should only be expanded, not reduced; in agricultural production reform, one can only move forward, not backward. The key to success or failure lies in whether the leaders are resolute promoters.

### 事实驳斥了怀疑派

    事实驳斥了怀疑派
    有一种“怀疑派”，对于农业生产上的各项改革，疑神疑鬼，总怕前进一步。甚至于在勉强壮起胆来走了一步已经得到一些好处之后，还以为这是“侥幸”，又停步不前了。也有人在别人催促下走了几步，因为劲头不足或者碰到意外的困难而受了一些挫折，于是“一年遭蛇咬，三年怕黄鳝”，更不敢大胆前进了。
    他们的怀疑，往往还是有“根据”的。有的说是过去从来没这样做过。有的说是我们这里曾经有人这样做过，失败了。有的说这样做好是好，就是我们这里条件不够。其实，他们的这些“根据”，都是过了时的。最根本的一点是：没有真正认识合作制度的威力，没有采取革命者的态度对待自然条件。
    种双季稻的问题就是这样。“怀疑派”所持的根据，不外是：人力不够，水不够，肥料不够，气候不对，等等。在个体经济时代，这些的确是难以克服的困难。现在，情况大不相同了，人力、地力统一调配、灵活运用，再加上在国家和工人阶级支援下对基本建设、生产工具等方面的改进，这些困难没有不能克服的。前年各地推广双季稻本来搞得很好，绝大部分是成功的。可是，个别失败的事例就把一些人吓怕了，使“怀疑派”在一些地方一时占了上风。如果不是如此，去年就会增产更多的粮食。
    安徽安庆专区和江苏松江专区的事实都说明了双季稻只该扩大，不该缩小；在农业生产改革方面，只可前进，不可后退。成败的关键，就在于领导者是不是坚决的促进派。
