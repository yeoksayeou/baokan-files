Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 6th. The Romanian newspaper "Spark" recently published an article by Iliescu exposing and criticizing the views of Benedict Kautsky, son of the traitor Karl Kautsky, a renegade who openly denied Marxism in the draft party program he put forward at the recent Austrian Socialist Party Congress.

The article first pointed out that at this congress of the Austrian Socialist Party, the traditional workers' international anthem was not sung, and the red flag, which had accompanied the development of the workers' movement for more than a hundred years, was replaced by the flags of the United Nations and others. The atmosphere lacked the militant slogans of the working class. What is even more regrettable are the guidelines put forward in some reports and documents, especially in the draft party program. This draft program was drawn up by Benedict Kautsky, the son of Karl Kautsky, the deceased leader of international opportunism and a traitor to Marxism.

The article then said that the draft party program submitted by the younger Kautsky to the congress had gone so far as to completely abandon Marxism. He believes that Marx and Engels are merely historical figures, and that their theories are outdated or even wrong. In the party program, Kautsky Jr. openly declared that "modern society is developing in a direction completely opposite to that predicted by Marx in the 'Communist Manifesto.'"

The author said that just as the entire course of historical development has fully confirmed the genius and foresight of Marx and Engels; just as the communist movement, as predicted by Marx and Engels in the "Communist Manifesto," has become a powerful movement; just as nearly one-third of humanity, or ten billion people, are advancing along the path pointed out by Marx and Engels, and, as Marx predicted long ago, many colonial countries have become independent countries after long struggles, and the shameful colonial system or its remnants have completely collapsed; is it not the case that what we see is enough to confirm the foresight of Marxism?

The author of the article pointed out that Kautsky Jr. advocates abandoning the basic principles of Marxism in the draft party program. He does not recognize class struggle and declares war on the dictatorship of the proletariat. He believes that class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat are "useless," "outdated," and "have a bad effect." He trumpets a "brotherly friendship" between exploiters and the exploited. He does not even mention the ultimate goal of eliminating human exploitation in form. He also believes that a working-class party based on class struggle is no longer needed. He also strongly opposes nationalization, opposes criticizing bourgeois ideology, and attacks nationalization as an "attack on the scope of capitalist privilege."

The author of the article emphasized that Kautsky Jr.'s advocacy of abandoning the basic principles of Marxism is in line with a situation that has long existed not only in the Austrian Socialist Party but also in other Social Democratic parties, namely, that the right-wing leaders of these parties do not want to have anything in common with Marxism. Because they are afraid of the growing trend within the party demanding joint action with the Communists, and at the same time they want to use "theoretical" arguments to convince Social Democratic workers that there is nothing in common between them and the Communists.

The author also said that Kautsky Jr. believes in the draft party program that the "mortal enemies of democratic socialism" are socialist countries and newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. He even suggested that socialist countries and independent countries in Asia and Africa must be opposed through "revolution (i.e., counter-revolution), civil war, and even foreign war," i.e., through open imperialist wars. In the name of democratic ideals, he cherishes an alliance with monopoly capital and frantically attempts to slander communism to terrorize Austrian workers. The author said that Kautsky Jr.'s purpose is to conceal from the workers the fact that the people's power in socialist countries implements democracy for the vast masses of the oppressed and exploited, and that it is not just empty talk but actually builds socialism, defends, and develops the socialist achievements of the people.

The author emphasized that no matter how rampant modern revisionism attacks Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the facts prove that it is only re-plagiarizing the old arguments of opportunism, reformism, anarchism, and other "predecessors" that have long been shattered by Marxism and life experience. Revisionism will inevitably form an alliance with imperialist reactionary forces, as the Hungarian incident fully confirmed.

    批判小考茨基修正主义观点
    新华社布加勒斯特6日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”最近发表了伊里埃斯库的一篇文章，揭露和批判叛徒卡尔·考茨基的儿子贝纳第克脱·考茨基在不久以前举行的奥地利社会党代表大会上所提出的党纲草案中公开否定马克思主义的观点。
    文章首先指出，在奥地利社会党这次代表大会上，这次大会不唱传统的工人阶级的国际歌，一百多年来伴随着工人运动发展的红旗也为联合国的和别的旗子所代替了，会场里没有工人阶级的战斗性口号。而更遗憾的是一些报告和文件、首先是党纲草案中所提出的方针。这个党纲草案是马克思主义的叛徒、已故的国际机会主义首领卡尔·考茨基的儿子——贝纳第克脱·考茨基起草的。
    文章接着说，小考茨基向大会提出的党纲草案已经走到了完全抛弃马克思主义的地步。他认为，马克思、恩格斯只不过是历史人物。他们的理论已经过时，甚至是错误的了。小考茨基在党纲里公开宣称，“近代社会是朝着完全同马克思在‘共产党宣言’中预言的相反方向发展的”。
    作者说，正当整个历史发展完全证实了马克思、恩格斯天才的预见性；正当共产主义运动正如马克思、恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中所预言的那样变成了声势浩大的运动；正当将近占人类三分之一的十亿人口朝着马克思、恩格斯所指的道路前进，同时，正如马克思早就预言的，许多殖民地国家经过长期的斗争已经成为独立的国家，而可耻的殖民体系或它的残余已经完全崩溃；正在这样的时候，贝·考茨基却提出了他的上述这些观点，难道我们眼见的一切还不足以证实马克思主义的预见性吗？
    文章作者指出，小考茨基在党纲草案中主张放弃马克思主义的基本原理。他不承认阶级斗争，并且向无产阶级专政宣战。他认为阶级斗争和无产阶级专政都是“无用的”、“过时的”和“起坏作用的”。他鼓吹实行一种剥削者和被剥削者之间的“兄弟般友好”。他甚至在形式上都只字不提消灭人剥削人这一最终目的。他还认为以阶级斗争作基础的工人阶级政党已不需要。他并且极力反对国有化、反对批判资产阶级思想，攻击国有化是“向资本主义特权范围的袭击”。
    文章作者强调说，小考茨基主张放弃马克思主义的基本原理，这就符合了一个实际上不仅在奥地利社会党内、也在其他社会民主党内长期存在的情况，这就是这些党的右翼领袖不想使自己和马克思主义有任何相同之点。因为他们害怕在党内存在的要求同共产党人统一行动的越来越强大的趋向，同时也想用“理论”论点来说服社会民主党工人，说在他们和共产党人之间没有任何共同之处。
    作者又说，小考茨基在党纲草案中认为“民主社会主义的死敌”是社会主义国家和亚非新出现的独立国家。他竟然建议，必须通过“革命（按即反革命）、内战、甚至外战”，即通过公开的帝国主义战争来反对社会主义国家和亚非独立国家。他假借民主理想的名义，珍惜同垄断资产阶级的联盟，疯狂地企图诽谤共产主义来恐吓奥地利工人。作者说，小考茨基的目的在于向工人隐瞒这样的事实：社会主义国家的人民政权对不久前被压迫、剥削的广大群众实行民主，它不是空口说而是在实际上建设社会主义，保卫和发展人民群众的社会主义成果。
    作者强调说，不管现代修正主义如何猖狂进攻马克思列宁主义学说，事实证明它只是重新瓢窃早就被马克思主义和生活的经验所粉碎了的机会主义、改良主义、无政府主义等等“前辈”们的陈旧论点。修正主义最后必然会同帝国主义反动力量结成联盟，匈牙利事件完全证实了这一点。
