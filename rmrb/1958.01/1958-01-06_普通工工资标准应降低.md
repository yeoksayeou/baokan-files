Ordinary Workers' Wage Standards Should Be Lowered

    I fully support the State Council's interim regulations on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and odd-job men in enterprises, institutions, and state organs, and I suggest that they be formally promulgated and implemented as soon as possible.
    In our construction industry, the proportion of ordinary workers used each year is very large. During the peak construction season, the ratio of ordinary workers to skilled workers can be as high as 1.3:1, and the annual average is at least 0.5:1. During the wage reform in 1956, the wage standards for ordinary workers were raised too high and too drastically, with wage increases generally exceeding those of skilled workers. Looking at several key areas in North China, the new monthly wage standards for ordinary workers in the construction industry increased by an average of more than 15% compared to the original monthly wage standards, exceeding the increase for skilled workers. For example, in the Beijing area, ordinary workers increased by 15.95%, while skilled workers increased by only 0.69%; in Baotou, ordinary workers increased by 22.34%, while skilled workers increased by only 7.13%; in Taiyuan, ordinary workers increased by 16.34%, while skilled workers increased by 1.18%. The work of ordinary workers in the construction industry mainly relies on physical strength, with little or no technical elements. It is clearly unreasonable for their wage increases to greatly exceed those of skilled workers who mainly rely on technical skills. Most ordinary workers are temporary workers and new workers. It is also not conducive to the unity of new and old workers if their wages are higher than those of older workers (skilled workers).
    In particular, most ordinary workers in the construction industry come from rural areas, and many of them are farmers from disaster areas. Their wage treatment is so high that it is obviously excessively disparate from the income of farmers' labor. According to a survey in Shanxi Province, after the wage reform in 1956, the daily time-based standard wage for a second-grade ordinary worker in the Taiyuan construction industry was 1.57 yuan (ordinary workers are generally paid according to the second-grade wage standard), which was 65% higher than the average income per working day of agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province, 124% higher than in the Yuci Special District, 106% higher than in the Yanbei Special District, 89% higher than in the Xinxian Special District, 96% higher than in the Changzhi Special District, and 39% higher than in the Jinnan Special District. Most of these ordinary workers come from the Yanbei, Xinxian, and Yuci Special Districts. The intensity of agricultural physical labor is not lower than that of the construction industry. Yesterday, they were farmers; today, they are doing the same kind of physical labor in the city, and their wage treatment is raised so high. This is also not conducive to consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    In reality, the income of ordinary workers is even higher than what is mentioned above. Currently, most ordinary workers implement a piece-rate wage system, which has a piece-rate coefficient 6% to 10% higher than the time-based wage standard. In addition, there are many problems with quota management now, and ordinary workers can generally exceed the quota by more than 20%. Calculating with a 20% excess and adding the piece-rate coefficient, an ordinary worker in the Taiyuan area can earn about two yuan per day. Such high wages are not commensurate with the work they undertake.
    The wages are high, and the political work for ordinary workers is not done well enough. Some ordinary workers have become infected with the unhealthy, frivolous and pleasure-seeking style of urban life. For example, the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering recruited a group of temporary workers from Jingle County. Although this county has suffered from disasters and reduced production since 1955, some of them eat extravagantly and spend recklessly. Some don't even have complete bedding, yet they buy watches, leather shoes, bicycles, want to smoke Daqianmen cigarettes, and drink "four liang of white liquor." When someone criticizes this bad phenomenon, they say, "We only spend the part that exceeds our agricultural income." Therefore, the excessively high wage standards for ordinary workers are also not beneficial to themselves.
    The high wage standards for ordinary workers are due, on the one hand, to our overestimation of the income of agricultural production cooperatives when formulating wage standards in 1956; on the other hand, the wages of these ordinary workers with great local variations were also unified by various industrial departments using a coefficient according to the wages of skilled workers. Therefore, I fully support the state's decentralization of ordinary workers' wage standards to local unified management.
    Our country has not yet overcome natural disasters in agriculture. Therefore, I suggest that when the State Council decentralizes the management of ordinary workers' wage standards to provinces (cities) and autonomous regions, it should also clearly stipulate that they should be published and revised at least once a year, so as to correspondingly increase or decrease the wage standards of ordinary workers according to whether the previous year's agriculture was a bumper harvest or a poor harvest. Because if agriculture has a bumper harvest and the wage standards of ordinary workers are not increased, it will be impossible to guarantee the labor needs of the basic construction sector; if agriculture has a poor harvest and the wages are not lowered, it will promote the blind influx of farmers into cities.

### 普通工工资标准应降低

    普通工工资标准应降低
    我完全拥护国务院关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定，并建议尽早正式颁布实施。
    我们建筑业每年使用普通工的比重非常大，在施工旺季普通工与技工的比例最高可达1.3∶1，全年平均至少也在0.5∶1。1956年工资改革的时候，普通工的工资标准提得过高过猛，增加工资幅度普遍地超过了技工。从华北几个重点地区看，建筑业普通工新的月工资标准较原来月工资标准增加幅度平均超过技工的15％左右。如北京地区普通工增加15.95％，技工仅增0.69％；包头普通工增加22.34％，技工只增7.13％；太原普通工增加16.34％，技工增加1.18％。建筑业的普通工的工作，主要依靠体力，没有或很少有技术因素，他们工资的增长幅度大大超过主要依靠技术因素操作的技工，显然是不合理的。普通工大都是临时工，并且都是新工人，他们的工资比老工人（技术工人）多，也不利于新老工人的团结。
    特别是建筑业普通工大部来自农村，其中很多是灾区农民，他们的工资待遇这样高，显然与农民的劳动收入过分悬殊。据在山西省调查，1956年工资改革后，太原建筑业二级普通工日计时标准工资是一元五角七分（普通工一般按二级工工资标准支付），要高于山西全省农业合作社每个劳动日平均收入的65％，高于榆次专区124％，高于雁北专区106％，高于忻县专区89％，高于长治专区96％，高于晋南专区39％。这些普通工又多来自雁北、忻县和榆次专区。农业体力劳动强度并不比建筑业低，昨天还是个农民，进了城干着同样性质的体力劳动，工资待遇就提得那么高，这也不利于巩固工农联盟。
    实际上，普通工的收入比上面讲的还要高。目前大部分普通工都实行计件工资制，这样就有高于计时工资标准6％至10％的计件系数，加上现在定额管理问题很多，普通工一般可以超额20％以上。以超额20％计算，加上计件系数，太原地区一个普通工每天就可以拿到二元左右工资。这样高的工资与他们所负担工作是不相适应的。
    工资高，对普通工的政治工作又做得不够，一部分普通工就沾染上城市不良的浮华享受作风。例如，建筑工程部华北太原工程局曾招了一批来自静乐县的临时工，虽然这个县从1955年就受灾减产，但其中有些人却乱吃乱花。有的连被褥也不全，却买手表、皮鞋、自行车、要吸大前门香烟，喝“四两白干酒”。有人对这种不良现象提出批评，他们却说：“我们只花超过农业收入的部分”。所以普通工工资标准过高，对他们自己也不利。
    普通工工资标准高，一方面是由于我们在1956年制订工资标准时过高的估计了农业生产社的收入；另一方面是把这种地方性很大的普通工的工资也由各产业部门按照技工工资采用一个系数给统一起来。因此，我完全拥护国家把普通工工资标准下放地方统一管理。
    我国农业自然灾害还不能克服，因此，我建议国务院在下放普通工工资标准由省（市）、自治区管理时，还需明确至少每年公布、修订一次，以便根据上一年度农业丰收还是歉收而相应提高或降低普通工的工资标准。因为农业丰收不提高普通工工资标准，就无法保证基本建设部门劳动力的需要；农业歉收不降低，就会促使农民盲目流入城市。
