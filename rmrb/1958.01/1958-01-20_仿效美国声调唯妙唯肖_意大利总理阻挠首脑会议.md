Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 19th: Italian Prime Minister Zoli, in his reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin on the 18th, echoed the American tune, emphasizing that a summit meeting could only be held after "agreeing on the issues to be studied and on which some consensus can be reached through diplomatic channels or through personal contact between foreign ministers." This letter was a response to Bulganin's letter of December 13. Zoli also tried his best to defend the Western proposals that have brought disarmament negotiations to a standstill and reiterated his support for the Western position obstructing the resolution of the German question.

In his letter, Zoli said that he "noted" Poland's proposal, supported by the Soviet Union, to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. At the same time, he insisted that a series of other major peace initiatives by the Soviet Union contained "nothing new."

In his reply, Zoli also slandered the Soviet Union, attempting to place the responsibility for the tense situation in the Middle East and the failure to achieve German reunification on the Soviet Union.

    仿效美国声调唯妙唯肖
    意大利总理阻挠首脑会议
    据新华社19日讯　罗马消息：意大利总理佐利18日在给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信中，追随美国的调子，强调必须先“通过外交途径或者通过外长之间的个人接触商妥要研究的而且以后可以取得某种一致意见的问题”以后，才能举行最高级会议。这封信是对布尔加宁12月13日的信的答复。佐利还竭力为西方使裁军谈判陷于僵局的建议辩护，并且重申支持西方阻挠解决德国问题的立场。
    佐利在信中说，他“注意到”波兰提出受到苏联支持的在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。同时，他硬说，苏联其他一系列重大和平倡议“没有什么新东西”。
    佐利在复信中还对苏联进行诽谤，企图把中东局势紧张以及德国未能实现统一的责任硬推到苏联身上去。
