Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 8th: In the mass anti-waste movement during the rectification phase, Fudan University uncovered a large number of facts about squandering state assets, giving all faculty, staff, and students a profound education.

At the university's anti-waste exhibition, faculty, staff, and students painfully saw that some people, in their pursuit of ostentation and grandeur, greedily sought excessive quantities and sizes, resulting in serious stockpiling and waste of state property. The Physics Department originally had four spectrometers. In 1956, it spent a huge sum of 180,000 yuan to purchase two spectrometers with automated equipment from abroad. The new spectrometers have not been used to this day, serving only for viewing; they also require dedicated personnel to strictly prevent moisture and maintain a certain temperature. This department used magnetic crucibles and copperware costing only a few cents for sodium chloride crystal cultivation experiments, but instead spent 12,000 yuan to buy a set of platinum equipment. The Plant Physiology Teaching and Research Group of the Biology Department already had equipment equivalent to that of a second-class weather station, but blindly purchased a set of wind speed, wind direction, and wind travel measuring instruments that the department's teachers and students were not very familiar with. Expensive instruments such as four steel analyzers worth 36,000 yuan, a high-pressure reactor worth 8,800 yuan, and an automatic recording polarograph worth more than 6,000 yuan were all purchased from abroad by the Physics and Chemistry Departments without clarifying the specifications, resulting in their inability to be used. Under the guidance of the thought of "preparing more and using less," the school stored microanalysis combustion tubes that could be used for more than 100 years, and stainless steel that could be used for 20 years. The exhibition also displayed a lot of usable equipment found in the trash.

The university's anti-waste movement also revealed that in the school's capital construction, in order to pursue beauty and symmetry, emphasis was placed on making two large buildings equally tall and large, resulting in an additional 70,000 yuan being spent on building costs. The school's Biology Department also built elaborate dog houses and chicken coops, and the catering department also built elaborate pigsties. The dog house, dubbed the "Dog Palace" by the masses, has 60 rooms, all with brick and wood structures and cement floors, costing as much as 50 to 55 yuan per square meter, which is higher than the cost of ordinary civilian housing. Every dog that is fortunate enough to live here has its own bedroom, bed, and exercise yard. There are also dog care rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, etc. Chickens with an average height of only 0.3 meters live in "Chicken Mansions" that are 2.2 meters high. The flooring used here is "tongue-and-groove flooring," which is rarely used even in urban residences. The pigs raised for food by the catering department also live in houses with brick walls and tile roofs, vermilion painted doors and windows, and cement floors.

Localism and individualism, unwillingness to mutually allocate instruments and materials, or greed for convenience emphasizing having their own set, are also causes of waste. Of the 1,273 kinds of journals from capitalist countries subscribed to by the whole school, 308 kinds are duplicates. The eight teaching and research groups of the Biology Department did not communicate with each other, and the whole department now has 22 incubators and 10 refrigerators. The Solid State Physics Laboratory and the Intermediate Physics Laboratory of the Physics Department each developed a set of electronic instruments.

After the countless cases of waste in the school were initially revealed, the teachers, staff, and students of Fudan University were greatly surprised. Many people said: Squandering the people's hard-earned money is a criminal act. Some professors who usually took great care of instruments and designed and assembled them themselves, and technicians who actively repaired damaged instruments, became role models for everyone to learn from. At present, Fudan University is discussing how to rationally handle stockpiled equipment and save on this year's expenditures.

    贵重仪器积压，有用器材丢弃  “狗宫”“鸡楼”胜过民用住宅
    复旦大学反对讲排场的坏风气
    据新华社上海8日电　复旦大学在整改阶段的群众性的反浪费运动中，揭发出挥霍国家资财的大量事实，使全校师生员工受到一次深刻的教育。
    在这个大学的反浪费展览会上，教职员工和学生们痛心地看到，因为有些人讲究排场和气派，贪多贪大，使国家财产遭到严重的积压和浪费。物理系原有四台光谱仪，1956年又以十八万元的巨款从国外购来两台有自动设备的光谱仪。新的光谱仪至今未使用，只供参观；还需要专人负责严格防潮和保持一定温度。这个系做培养氯化钠晶体实验，用磁坩埚和铜器只要几角钱，却用了一万二千元买了一套白金设备。生物系植物生理教研组本来已有相当于二等测候站的设备，又盲目购来一套系里师生还不大会使用的风速、风向、风程测定仪。价值三万六千元的四架析钢仪和值八千八百元的一台高压釜、值六千多元的自动记录极谱仪等贵重仪器，都是没有弄清规格就由物理系和化学系从国外购来，结果无法使用。在少用多备的思想指导下，这个学校储存的微量分析燃烧管可用一百年以上，不锈钢可用二十年。展览会还展出了从垃圾堆里找出来的许多可用的器材。
    这个大学反浪费运动还揭发出，在学校基本建设中，为了追求美观、对称，强调二座大楼同样高大，结果房屋造价多支出了七万元。这个学校的生物系还建筑了考究的狗房、鸡舍，膳食科也建筑了考究的猪屋。被群众称作“狗宫”的狗房共有六十间，一律采用砖木结构，水泥地坪，每平方公尺造价高达到五十至五十五元，比一般民用住宅的造价还高。幸运地居住在这里的每一条狗，都有独自的卧室、卧床和运动场。另外还有狗的护理室、浴室、厨房等。身体平均高度只有零点三公尺的鸡，住的是二点二公尺高的“鸡楼”，这里所用的地板，是城市居房中也很少采用的“企口地板”。膳食科饲养的供食用的猪，住的也是砖墙瓦顶、朱漆门窗、水泥地坪的房子。
    本位主义和个人主义，不肯互相调用仪器材料，或贪图方便强调各备一套，也是造成浪费的原因。全校订购的资本主义国家期刊一千二百七十三种中，有复本的达三百零八种。生物系八个教研组互不通气，全系现有温箱二十二个，冰箱十个。物理系固体物理实验室和中级物理实验室各搞了一套电子学仪器。
    学校里的不胜枚举的浪费现象初步揭发以后，使复旦大学教师、职工和学生们大吃一惊，很多人说：挥霍人民的血汗，真是犯罪的行为。一些平时十分爱护仪器并自己动手设计装配仪器的教授、积极修理损坏仪器的技术员，成了大家学习的榜样。目前，复旦大学正对如何合理处理积压的器材，节约今年的经费开支的问题展开讨论。
