Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th. Anshan Iron and Steel's construction workers, reversing the previous situation of doing little work at the beginning of the year, are determined to complete more than 27% of the year's construction plan in the first quarter of this year. They aim to complete and partially complete twelve projects to ensure balanced construction and create conditions for striving to achieve a great leap forward in construction this year.

Despite Anshan being in the cold, icy, and snowy season, construction workers, encouraged by the rectification movement, are undertaking the construction of more than thirty projects and have launched a construction upsurge to complete the state plan ahead of schedule. On the vast construction site of the Dong Anshan iron ore preparation plant, thousands of workers swing tools to dig frozen soil, or pour steaming concrete into huge foundations, not stopping construction even at dusk when it snows lightly. Lang Yunzhi, the famous excavator operator and Anshan model worker on this construction site, and his partners proposed to guarantee the excavation and transportation of one million cubic meters of earthwork during the Second Five-Year Plan, exceeding the current state quota by more than double. Now, they are braving the cold wind, starting excavators to gnaw at the frozen soil. The construction workers on the site are guaranteeing to complete this huge project in a little over a year, one month ahead of schedule. The people building the second phase of the Dashiqiao Magnesite Brick Factory and the Qingshanhuai Magnesite Mine in the valley are also working day and night, striving to complete these two huge projects in the first half of the year. The brand-new No. 3 large coke oven, due to the construction workers creating the fastest record for building refractory bricks in recent years, has been preheated ahead of schedule, and the workers are nervously preparing all conditions to put it into production in February.

In this construction upsurge, various construction departments have adopted various measures to actively prepare the building materials needed for construction. Many leading cadres have also gone to the construction site to inspect the quality of the project, trying to eliminate major quality accidents and reduce general quality accidents to ensure the quality and progress of the project.

    变前松后紧为均衡施工
    鞍钢建设者决心在一季度完成全年27％的工作量
    新华社鞍山10日电　鞍钢的建设者们一反过去年初干活少的情况，决心在今年第一季度完成占全年施工计划27％以上的工作量，建成和部分建成十二项工程，以保证均衡施工，为争取实现今年建设的大跃进创造条件。
    尽管鞍山正处在冰天雪地的寒冷季节，但是受到整风运动鼓舞的建设者们，承担着三十多项工程的施工任务，仍然掀起了提前完成国家计划的建设热潮。在广阔的东鞍山铁矿石准备厂工地上，数千名职工抡着工具开凿冻土，或者把蒸汽腾腾的混凝土浇灌到巨大的基础里，即使在夜幕降临、小雪纷纷的时刻，也未停止建设。这个工地上的著名挖土机手、鞍山市劳动模范郎运治和他的伙伴们提出保证，要在第二个五年计划期间挖运一百万立方公尺土方，超过国家目前的定额一倍以上。现在，他们正迎着寒风，开动挖土机啃啮着冻土。工地的建设者们，保证提前一个月，以一年多的时间建成这座巨大的工程。在山谷里建设着大石桥镁砖厂第二期工程和青山怀镁矿的人们，也在日夜不停地工作着，争取在上半年建成这两个巨大的工程。全新的三号大型炼焦炉，由于建设者创造了历年来砌耐火砖最快的纪录，已经提前烘炉，职工们正紧张地准备一切条件，使它在二月份投入生产。
    在这个建设热潮中，各个施工部门采取了各种措施，积极准备施工需要的建筑材料。许多领导干部也到工地检查工程质量，设法消灭重大质量事故，减少一般质量事故，以保证工程质量和进度。
