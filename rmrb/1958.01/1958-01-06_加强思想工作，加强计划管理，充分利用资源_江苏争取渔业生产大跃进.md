Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 5th: Jiangsu Province plans to produce 400,000 tons of aquatic products this year, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. This was determined at the recent provincial aquatic work conference after criticizing conservative ideas and analyzing the favorable conditions for a great leap forward in fishery production.

In 1957, Jiangsu Province produced 300,400 tons of aquatic products, exceeding the state plan by 11%, and turned over more than 2.24 million yuan in profits to the state.

Some representatives attending the meeting believed that the fishery production base in the province was poor and that a great leap forward was impossible. After research and analysis, it was unanimously agreed that Jiangsu Province, known as the land of fish and rice, has great potential for increased production. The province has eight million mu of freshwater area suitable for fish farming, but only more than two million mu are currently utilized. Even the areas that have been utilized have low yields, with an average of only 62 jin of fish per mu, while the highest has reached 1,700 jin. There are 600,000 mu of shallow sea along the coast that can be used for breeding shellfish and algae, but most of them have not been utilized. In terms of fishing, the current actual catch is only one-quarter of the possible catch. If breeding and protection measures can be earnestly implemented, production tools can be improved, fishing grounds can be expanded, and year-round operations can be carried out, production can be greatly increased.

Some representatives believed that a great leap forward was possible, but the state needed to provide funds. The meeting concluded that appropriate state support was necessary, but the main thing was to rely on the masses to actively expand public accumulation and overcome difficulties such as lack of funds and materials. Many representatives cited typical examples of relying on the masses to overcome difficulties, criticizing the idea of simply relying on the state.

The meeting held that to complete this year's aquatic product production tasks, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological education work for cadres and the masses, carry out the struggle between the two roads, appropriately adjust the prices of fish fry and summer seedlings, strengthen planning management, and strictly crack down on speculative activities.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has listed the development of aquatic industry as one of the three major construction priorities of Jiangsu Province, requiring the total output of aquatic products in the province to reach two million tons by 1967.

### 加强思想工作，加强计划管理，充分利用资源  江苏争取渔业生产大跃进

    加强思想工作，加强计划管理，充分利用资源
    江苏争取渔业生产大跃进
    新华社南京5日电　江苏省计划今年出产水产品四十万吨，比去年增加30％以上。这是最近举行的全省水产工作会议，在批判了保守思想，分析了渔业生产大跃进的有利条件以后确定的。
    江苏省1957年出产了水产品三十万零四千吨，超过国家计划11％，上缴给国家的利润达二百二十四万多元。
    出席会议的代表中，有些人认为本省渔业生产基础差，不可能大跃进。经过研究分析，一致认为江苏省素称鱼米之乡，增产潜力很大。全省有八百万亩淡水面积可以养鱼，但目前只利用了二百二十多万亩，即使已经利用起来的，产量也很低，全省平均每亩仅产鱼六十二斤，而最高的已达一千七百斤。沿海有六十万亩浅海可以养殖贝、藻类，但是大部分没有利用起来。在捕捞方面，目前实际捕捞量仅等于可捕捞量的四分之一，如能认真贯彻繁殖保护措施，改进生产工具，扩大渔场范围，开展常年作业，还可以使产量大大提高。
    有些代表认为：大跃进是能够的，但要国家拿钱。会议讨论结果，认为国家适当支持是必要的，但主要应依靠群众积极扩大公共积累，克服缺乏资金、物资等困难。很多代表举出依靠群众克服困难的典型事例，批判了单纯依赖国家的思想。
    会议认为，要完成今年水产品生产任务，必须加强对干部和群众进行政治思想教育工作，开展两条道路的斗争，并须适当调整鱼种、夏花价格，加强计划管理，严格取缔投机活动。
    中共江苏省委已把发展水产事业列为江苏省三大重点建设之一，要求到1967年全省水产总产量达到二百万吨。
