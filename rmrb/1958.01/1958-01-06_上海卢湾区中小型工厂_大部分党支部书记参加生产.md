Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 5th: The Party organizations in more than two hundred factories in Shanghai's Luwan District have recently adopted a revolutionary measure: the Party branch secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party have left their desks and returned to their production posts.

Of the 270 factories and handicraft production cooperatives in this district, with the exception of 39 units that are undergoing rectification, the majority of the Party branch secretaries in the remaining 231 units have already returned to their production posts; the remaining part will return to their production posts in the next day or two.

These factories are generally small and medium-sized, and the branch secretaries do not have many daily affairs. After returning to production, their connection with the masses has become closer, and their work is easier to do. The implementation of this measure has also brought new problems. The first is to force the district committee to change its old leadership style and working methods. At the same time, new questions are raised for branch work: such as how branch secretaries grasp the overall situation, how to better realize the Party's leadership and supervisory role, and how to strengthen political and ideological work. The district committee is now working on studying these issues.

    上海卢湾区中小型工厂
    大部分党支部书记参加生产
    据新华社上海5日电　上海卢湾区的二百多个工厂党组织最近采取了一项革命性措施：中共党支部书记离开自己的办公桌，回到生产岗位上去了。
    这个区的二百七十个工厂和手工业生产合作社中，除了正在进行整风的三十九个单位以外，其余二百三十一个单位的党支部书记大部已经回到生产岗位；还有一部分，在最近一两天内就要回到生产岗位上去。
    这批厂一般都是中小型厂，支部书记日常事务不很多，回到生产中去以后与群众的联系密切了，工作更加好做。这项措施实行以后，也带来新的问题。首先是逼着区委要改变老的领导作风和工作方法。同时，对支部工作也提出新的问题：如支部书记怎样掌握全面情况？怎样更好实现党的领导和监督作用？怎样加强政治思想工作等。区委现在正在着手研究这些问题。
