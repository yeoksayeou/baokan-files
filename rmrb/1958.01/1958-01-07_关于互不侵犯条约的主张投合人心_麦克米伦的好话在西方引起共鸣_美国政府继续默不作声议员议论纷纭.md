Comprehensive report from our newspaper: British Prime Minister Macmillan's talk about Western countries being able to sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union has aroused strong reactions in political and public opinion circles in many Western countries.

French officials welcomed Macmillan's suggestion. Sources close to the French Foreign Ministry believe that Macmillan's speech will help ease international tensions and establish contact with the Soviet Union.

At a reception celebrating his eighty-second birthday on the 5th, West German Chancellor Adenauer told reporters that the British Prime Minister Macmillan's proposal to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union gave him "a very good impression," but he needed to "carefully study Macmillan's speech before he can say more." At the same time, some government officials in Bonn reiterated the consistent arguments of the United States and other Western countries, attempting to deny the significance of signing a non-aggression treaty under the pretext of the existence of the United Nations Charter.

A spokesperson for the West German Social Democratic Party's parliamentary group said: Support must be given to several parts of Macmillan's speech, especially the parts about holding disarmament talks with the East and signing a non-aggression treaty. The spokesperson also called for simultaneous discussion of Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

Canadian Acting Secretary of State for External Affairs David Fulton on the 4th welcomed British Prime Minister Macmillan's suggestion that a non-aggression treaty could be signed with the Soviet Union. He regarded this statement as opening up new possibilities for East-West negotiations. He said Canada hopes to see the realization of East-West negotiations.

Former Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Pearson said on the same day that Macmillan's suggestion was "a good idea." He said, "It is time for the West to show a little initiative that is not just for propaganda purposes."

Meanwhile, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Sidney Smith, on his way to Calgary to attend a conference, said in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, that Canada could "play a mediating role" in future East-West talks to ease tensions.

The Italian "Avanti!" believes that Macmillan has suddenly changed the West's "traditional" position on East-West negotiations. He created the impression that the "satellite era" has forced most members of the Western bloc to adopt a more sensible position.

The bourgeois newspaper "Il Giorno" also believes that "Macmillan's initiative seems to be very much in line with the wishes of the British public representatives to the British government."

The U.S. government continued to refuse to comment on Macmillan's proposal on the 5th. A State Department spokesman said on the 4th that the suggestion was "unexpected." White House Press Secretary Hagerty, in a conversation with reporters on the 5th, again tried to cover up by saying that U.S. President Eisenhower had been in contact with British Prime Minister Macmillan recently, and the two of them "correspond very frequently." But when reporters asked whether Eisenhower and Macmillan had ever discussed the proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the East and West, Hagerty declined to comment.

Sources say that Macmillan did not consult with Eisenhower or State Department officials before making the proposal.

Some U.S. senators continue to discuss the proposal. U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Sparkman, commenting on Macmillan's proposal to conclude an East-West non-aggression treaty on the 5th, said that the proposal showed "a lack of cooperation" between Britain and the United States and meant that the United States did not occupy the "recognized leadership position" as in the past. Sparkman also spread skepticism about the value of a non-aggression treaty. Senator Morse said he did not "completely" agree with Macmillan, but he also did not completely agree with Dulles' firm opposition to concluding a non-aggression treaty or holding top-level talks with the Soviet Union now. He said he believed that negotiations should be conducted at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly. Senator Mansfield said he believed that an East-West non-aggression treaty "wouldn't do much good or much harm." He said the West "should start from the basics" and try to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet Union on important issues such as disarmament.

### 关于互不侵犯条约的主张投合人心  麦克米伦的好话在西方引起共鸣  美国政府继续默不作声议员议论纷纭

    关于互不侵犯条约的主张投合人心
    麦克米伦的好话在西方引起共鸣
    美国政府继续默不作声议员议论纷纭
    本报综合报道　英国首相麦克米伦关于西方国家可以同苏联签订一项互不侵犯条约的谈话，在西方许多国家政界和舆论界引起了强烈的反应。
    法国官方人士对麦克米伦的建议表示欢迎。接近法国外交部的人士认为，麦克米伦的讲话将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和同苏联建立接触。
    西德总理阿登纳5日在庆祝他的八十二岁生日的招待会上对记者们说，英国首相麦克米伦提出的关于同苏联签订互不侵犯条约的建议使他获得“一个很好的印象”，但是，他需要“仔细研究麦克米伦的谈话以后才能说更多的话”。同时，波恩一些政府人士重申美国和其他西方国家一贯的论点，借口有联合国宪章存在而企图抹杀签订互不侵犯条约的意义。
    西德社会民主党议会党团发言人说：对于麦克米伦的演说的几个部分必须给予支持，特别是同东方举行裁军谈判和签订互不侵犯条约这些部分。这个发言人还要求同时讨论波兰所提出的在中欧建立无原子武器地区的方案。
    加拿大代理外交部长戴维·弗尔顿4日表示欢迎英国首相麦克米伦关于可以同苏联签订一项互不侵犯条约的建议。他把这个声明看作是给东西方谈判打开了新的可能性。他说，加拿大希望看到东西方谈判的实现。
    加拿大前外交部长皮尔逊同一日说，麦克米伦的建议是一个“好主意”。他说，“现在是西方表示一点点不仅仅以宣传为目的的主动性的时候了”。
    同时，加拿大外交部长悉尼·史密斯前往卡尔加利参加一个会议途中在加拿大的安大略州的温索尔发表谈话说：加拿大可以在未来的东西方举行的缓和紧张局势的会谈中“起调解人的作用”。
    意大利“前进报”认为麦克米伦突然改变了西方在东西方谈判问题上的“传统”立场。他造成这样一种印象：“卫星时代”使西方集团的大部分成员国不得不采取更加明智的立场。
    资产阶级报纸“日报”也认为，“麦克米伦的倡议看来很符合英国公众代表向英国政府提出的愿望”。
    美国政府5日继续拒绝评论麦克米伦的建议。国务院发言人在4日说过，这个建议是“出乎意料之外的”。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂5日在同记者谈话中又进行掩饰说，美国总统艾森豪威尔最近一直同英国首相麦克米伦保持接触，他们二人“十分经常地通信”。但是当记者问及艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦是否曾经讨论过关于东西方缔结互不侵犯条约的建议时，哈格蒂拒绝加以说明。
    有消息说，麦克米伦在提出这个建议前，事先并未曾同艾森豪威尔或国务院官员商量过。
    美国一些参议员继续在谈论着这个建议。美国参议院外交委员会委员斯巴克曼5日在评论麦克米伦关于缔结东西方互不侵犯条约的建议时说，这个建议表明英国同美国之间“缺乏合作”，并且意味着美国不像过去那样占有“公认的领导地位”。斯巴克曼并对互不侵犯条约的价值散布怀疑论调。参议员莫尔斯说，他不“完全”同意麦克米伦的意见，但是也不完全同意杜勒斯坚决反对缔结互不侵犯条约或者现在同苏联举行最高级谈判的意见。他说，他认为谈判应当在联合国大会特别会议上进行。参议员曼斯菲尔德说，他认为东西方签订互不侵犯条约“不会有多大好处，也不会有多大坏处”。他说，西方“应该从根本做起”，设法同苏联就像裁军这样重要的问题达成令人满意的协议。
