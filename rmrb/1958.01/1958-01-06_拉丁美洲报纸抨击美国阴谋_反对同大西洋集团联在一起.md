Xinhua News Agency, January 4th dispatch: According to TASS, Montevideo, January 3rd: Progressive newspapers in Latin American countries continue to criticize the plan proposed by Peruvian President Prado, orchestrated by the U.S. State Department, to link Latin American countries with the North Atlantic Group.

    The Brazilian "Worker's Voice" pointed out that "Pradoism" seeks to establish a closer link between the Rio de Janeiro Treaty signed in 1947 and the North Atlantic Treaty. The newspaper said that recently, Peruvian President Prado discussed this proposal with Brazilian Foreign Minister Macedo Soares in Lima, and Soares then made a statement saying that Brazil might join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "if Brazil receives an invitation."

    The Argentine "People's Resistance" published an editorial saying, "Currently, our weak Organization of American States, like a pack of hounds leashed by its master, is suffering the threat of merging with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. What do we have in common with the North Atlantic military organization?"

    The Uruguayan "People's News" pointed out that the purpose of the Prado-Dulles plan is simply to tie Latin America more tightly to the chariot of war.

    The Chilean "Century" wrote in an article: "The people of Latin American countries do not want to add another burden to their backs, even without this new burden, they are already bent over by the burden of the arms race."

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th dispatch: According to TASS, Buenos Aires, January 3rd: The Chilean "Century" published an article entitled "The Consequences of the Arms Race," pointing out that the expansion of armaments has brought a heavy burden to the economies of Latin American countries and has forced them to spend a large amount of money on unproductive expenditures, while the people of these countries live in hunger, cold, and poverty, and have no opportunity to receive the necessary education and medical care.

    According to the statistics of this newspaper, Brazil's annual military expenditure is 800 million to 1 billion US dollars; Argentina's annual military expenditure accounts for 23% of the national budget; Colombia, 20%; Ecuador, 40%; Venezuela, 20%; Chile, 23%. At the same time, there are 14 million school-age children in Latin America who have not received any education. The newspaper opposes the plan to make American countries join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and points out the harm of this military alliance to the people of Latin American countries.

    拉丁美洲报纸抨击美国阴谋
    反对同大西洋集团联在一起
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚3日讯：拉丁美洲国家的进步报纸继续抨击美国国务院策划的而由秘鲁总统普拉多提出的关于把拉丁美洲国家同北大西洋集团联在一起的计划。
    巴西“工人呼声报”指出，“普拉多主义”追求的目的是使1947年签订的里约热内卢条约同北大西洋条约之间建立更密切的联系。报纸说，不久前，秘鲁总统普拉多曾经同巴西外交部长马塞多·索雷斯在利马讨论了这个建议，索雷斯并且接着发表谈话说，巴西可能加入北大西洋公约组织，“如果巴西接到邀请的话”。
    阿根廷“人民抵抗报”发表社论说，“目前，我们这个弱小的美洲国家组织像被主人用皮带拴着的一群猎狗一样，正在遭受同北大西洋公约组织合并的威胁。北大西洋军事组织同我们之间有什么共同之处呢？”
    乌拉圭“人民报”指出，普拉多—杜勒斯计划的目的仅是为了要把拉丁美洲更紧地绑在战车上。
    智利“世纪报”在一篇文章中写道：“拉丁美洲各国人民不愿在自己背上再加一付重担，即使没有这付新的重担，也已经被军备竞赛的重担把身子压弯了。”
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯3日讯：智利“世纪报”刊载了一篇题为“军备竞赛的后果”的文章，指出扩充军备给拉丁美洲国家的经济带来了重担，并且不得不使它们把大量金钱花在非生产性的支出上，而这些国家的人民却过着饥寒和贫困的生活，也没有机会受到必要的教育和医疗。
    根据这家报纸的统计材料，巴西每年军费支出为八亿到十亿美元；阿根廷每年军费支出占国家预算23％；哥伦比亚，占20％；厄瓜多尔，占40％；委内瑞拉，占20％；智利，占23％。同时，拉丁美洲有一千四百万完全没有受过任何教育的学龄儿童。这家报纸反对使美洲国家加入北大西洋公约组织的计划，并且指出了这个军事联盟对拉丁美洲各国人民的危害性。
