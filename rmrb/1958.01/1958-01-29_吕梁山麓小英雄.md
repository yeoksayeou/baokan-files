    Little Hero of the Lüliang Mountains
    By Our Correspondent Gu Ye

    It was a clear day in early January when we left Jishan County and headed towards a steep peak at the southern end of the Lüliang Mountains, entering the village of Gaoqu at the foot of the mountain. In a clean and tidy courtyard, we met a child not yet seven years old. His forehead was covered by a lock of soft, black hair left on the top of his head. His eyes and eyebrows were full of smiles. He was wearing a black padded jacket and patterned trousers, his height only slightly taller than the table. This is Jiao Danwa, the little hero of catching mice and exterminating sparrows, praised by the people at the foot of the mountain.

    He entered the first grade of Xishe Township Primary School in Jishan County in the autumn of 1957. From the beginning of his schooling, he regarded his textbooks as very precious, and wrapped each book with a cover. One day, his Chinese textbook was gnawed by a mouse. He sat uneasily in the classroom all morning. After school, he rummaged through boxes and cabinets, taking out bowls and basins. His mother asked, "What are you going to do?" Danwa said, "I'm going to use the basin for kneading dough to trap mice." His mother was afraid that he would carelessly injure his hands and feet, so she said, "What if the basin breaks?" Danwa had to use tongs to hit the mice.

    One day, Danwa was rolling in his mother's arms, pouting and saying, "Mom! Why are you always unhappy when I hit mice?" "Who asked you to meddle in other people's business? Aren't you disgusted by the dirtiness of the mice?!" When little Danwa heard his mother say this, he immediately ran to get his Chinese textbook and held it out in front of her chest, saying, "Mom! Look, the book has been gnawed by it. You said that my jacket has also been chewed up by the mice. Don't you hate mice? You said mice are dirty, and it is precisely because they are dirty that we have to eliminate them, not let them stay at home and build nests. The teacher said that mice dig holes in the walls and search for food, which will spread plague to us. The plague means getting sick. If you get seriously ill, you won't survive!" These words made his mother grin. His mother touched his head and said, "Okay! I agree. You can hit the mice. But be careful not to hit your hands."

    Now that no one was stopping him, the number of mice and sparrows he caught in his home and yard increased day by day. After he joined the "Eliminate the Four Pests" group organized in his class on December 7th last year, he caught even more mice and sparrows. For several days, in order to wait for the sparrows to enter the sieve he had set up, he even missed his studies. The teacher told him that eliminating the four pests and studying should not be neglected, and that he should be able to catch mice and sparrows without someone watching. When Danwa returned home, he thought hard, staring blankly at the sieve for trapping sparrows, muttering to himself: If the sparrow itself knocks down that stick and traps itself, it won't delay my going to school. He thought that if the thing he used to trap them was smaller and the stick was thinner, wouldn't that work? He put two bricks together, then used a thin stick to prop up one brick, and put bird feed next to the stick. Sure enough, the sparrow knocked down the stick itself and was pressed under the brick. From then on, Danwa would get up before dawn and quietly go to the yard, using seven or eight bricks to build three or four small shelters. Then he would rush to school. When he came back for breakfast after school, he could pick up one or two sparrows under each pile of bricks. Later, he also tried to use drawers to trap mice, but he could not catch them. He told the teacher, and the teacher asked him to find out the rat holes in his home. He found six rat holes at home and sealed them with paper. If the paper was pierced, he knew that there were rats in the hole, and then he put the drawer and rat bait near the rat hole where there were rats, and the rats were caught. These two methods were really good. They didn't cost any money, didn't require anyone to watch, didn't delay studying, and could catch mice and sparrows. From December 7th of last year to January 4th of this year, Danwa caught seventy-seven sparrows and killed thirty-nine mice. Including the previous catches, he caught a total of one hundred and twelve sparrows and exterminated a total of forty-six mice, becoming a model for eliminating the four pests in Xishe Township. Speaking of his studies, his grades were good. The results of the first semester exam: Chinese 92 points, Arithmetic 100 points, Drawing 90 points, Physical Education 87 points, Singing 91 points, and Conduct 90 points. The little classmates all proposed to learn from Danwa.

    Danwa also said to people: "Chairman Mao calls on us to turn China into a country free of the four pests. I am a child of New China, and I must actively respond to Chairman Mao's call and be a little hero in eliminating the four pests!"

    As dusk approached, we walked out of this village surrounded by thick earthen walls. There were no sparrows to be seen in the trees by the village, and everything around was very quiet. I thought: If everyone were like Danwa, it would not be difficult to turn China into a country free of the four pests.

    吕梁山麓小英雄
    本报记者　顾页
    是1月上旬的一个晴朗日子，我们离开稷山县城，朝着吕梁山南端一座陡峭山峰的方向进发，走进了山脚下的高渠村。在一家清扫得十分洁净的院落里，见到了一个不足七岁的孩子。他的前额披着留在头顶的一绺细软黑发，眉眼含着笑意，穿一身黑袄花裤，个子只比桌子稍高些。这就是山下的人们赞许的捕鼠灭雀的小英雄焦蛋娃。
    他是1957年秋季进入稷山县西社乡完小一年级的，从当学生起，就把课本看得很贵重，每一本书都包上了封皮。一天，他的语文课本被老鼠咬破了。他在课堂上不安地坐了一个上午，放学回家，便翻箱倒柜，拿碗弄盆。妈妈问道，“你要干什么？”蛋娃说：“拿和面的瓦盆扣老鼠。”妈妈怕他不仔细砸了手脚，借口说：“瓦盆打烂了怎么办？”蛋娃只得用夹子打。
    一天，蛋娃滚在妈妈的怀里，噘着小嘴说：“妈妈！我打老鼠，你怎么总不高兴？”“谁让你管闲事，你就不嫌老鼠肮脏！？”小蛋娃听妈妈说出这话，立即跑去拿了语文课本来，伸到她胸前，说：“妈妈！你看书都给它咬破了，你说过，我的袄也给老鼠咬烂了，你不恨老鼠？你说老鼠肮脏，就是肮脏才要消灭它，不让它在家里停留造窝。老师说，老鼠在家里掏墙洞、搜吃食，会给我们传鼠疫，鼠疫就是生病，病重了，人就不得活啦！”一席话把妈妈说得咧开了嘴，妈妈摸着他的头说：“好！妈妈情愿了，你打老鼠吧。可也要小心点，别打着手。”
    没有人阻碍他了，他在家里、院里捉的老鼠麻雀一天一天增多起来。他在去年12月7日加入班上组织的除四害小组以后，捕鼠灭雀就更多了。有几天他为了等着麻雀进入他布置好的筛子，甚至误了功课。老师对他说，除四害和学习应该两不误，要做到不用人守着也能捉到鼠雀。蛋娃回家就左思右想，看着扣麻雀的筛子发呆，自言自语地说：让麻雀自己撞倒那根棍，自己扣住自己，就不耽误我上学了。他想扣的东西小些，棍细些，不就行了吗。他把两块砖头放在一起，然后用细棍撑起一块砖来，棍旁放上雀食，麻雀果然自己撞倒了棍，被压在砖下了。从此，蛋娃在天不明，就起来轻手轻脚走到院里，用七八块砖搭好三、四个小棚，就赶到学校去，等他上罢学回来吃早饭，每堆砖下便可以拣到一两只麻雀。后来他又想法用抽屉扣老鼠，但是老扣不着，他去告诉老师，老师要他查清家里的鼠洞，他回家查出六个鼠洞，用纸糊了。纸被戳破的，就知道洞里有老鼠，然后把抽屉和鼠食放在有鼠的鼠洞附近，老鼠就被抓住了。这两个办法确实好，既不花钱，又不用人看守，不耽误学习，还能捉到鼠雀。蛋娃从去年12月7日到今年1月4日就捉到了麻雀七十七只，打死了老鼠三十九只，连同以前一起计算，他捕雀共一百一十二只，灭鼠共四十六只，成了西社乡的除四害模范。说到他的学习，成绩不错，第一学期考试结果：语文九十二分，算术一百分，图画九十分，体育八十七分，唱歌九十一分，操行九十分。小同学们都提出要向蛋娃学习。
    蛋娃还对人说：“毛主席号召我们把中国变成四无国。我是新中国的儿童，一定要积极响应毛主席的号召，当一个除四害的小英雄！”
    临近黄昏时分，我们走出了这个被厚土墙环绕的村庄，村边的树上，看不见麻雀，四周也很宁静。我想：如果人们都像蛋娃那样，要把中国变成四无国并不是件难事。
