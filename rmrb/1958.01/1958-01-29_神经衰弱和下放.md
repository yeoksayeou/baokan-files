    Neurasthenia and Going Down to the Countryside
    Wang Yi
    A friend who used to frequently ask me for prescriptions for sleeping pills and headache medicine suddenly stopped coming for a long time. I was making all sorts of guesses when he came to my house. As soon as he entered, he blurted out, "Doctor, I'll never bother you again. Going down to the countryside cured my illness. I've only been in the countryside for a little over a month, and now I can fall asleep as soon as I go to bed, and my head doesn't hurt anymore...". I looked him over and, sure enough, he was energetic, radiant, and not at all like his previous listless, yawning self.

    He was originally a neurasthenia patient who hadn't been able to fall asleep without sleeping pills for over a year. I had also advised him to engage in physical labor for a period of time, but the conditions weren't right. Now that the Party has proposed the policy of cadres going down to the countryside, in my opinion as a neurologist, this policy is an unprecedentedly effective prescription that can not only cure ideological illnesses but also neurasthenia.

    Neurasthenia is a disease that has existed for a long time. The Baihe disease described by the famous ancient Chinese doctor Zhang Zhongjing is very similar to this disease. Foreign countries also began to widely record and discuss this disease from the eighteenth century onwards. However, it was not until the development of Pavlov's theory that the truth about this disease became clear.

    It turns out that neurasthenia is caused by excessive tension and imbalance in the higher nervous activity of the cerebral cortex, which cannot restore normal function for a while. Overly heavy work without adequate rest, excessive grief, sadness, fear, and anxiety, as well as prolonged suppression of one's emotions, can all cause neurasthenia. Statistically, intellectuals suffer from this disease the most because they are mostly mental laborers, so people also call it an "intellectual occupational disease." The symptoms of this disease are diverse and ever-changing. Some people feel prominently mentally fatigued and weak, while others find memory loss, palpitations, shortness of breath, or spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation to be the most prominent, but almost all have common symptoms such as insomnia and headaches. Regardless of the symptoms, they all have their pathophysiological basis, which cannot be confused with ideological problems.

    There are many methods for treating neurasthenia, such as various drug therapies, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, mud therapy, oxygen baths, tissue therapy, sleep therapy, etc., but they all have a certain scope of use and are subject to certain conditions, and not every neurasthenia patient is suitable. Only physical labor therapy, except for those with severe conditions (bedridden), is suitable for general neurasthenia patients, and is particularly beneficial for the treatment of insomnia. Because, the principle of treating neurasthenia, in addition to eliminating the causes of the disease, is mainly to allow the cerebral cortex to get adequate rest in order to restore its normal function. Appropriate physical labor is one of the most effective ways to achieve this.

    First of all, for mental laborers, appropriate physical labor, like regular physical exercise, is a "positive rest," is "nerve cells doing gymnastics" (Pavlov's words). It can not only enhance the analytical and synthetic abilities of the brain, promote the brain's metabolism, improve the brain's nutrition, and adjust brain function; but also strengthen the activity of internal organs, make the connection of all parts of the body more coordinated, which in turn will promote the health of the nervous system.

    Secondly, the physical hardship of physical labor can cultivate various qualities such as strength, courage, resourcefulness, decisiveness, confidence, patience, as well as collectivism and revolutionary optimism. This also plays a significant role in the treatment of neurasthenia.

    Thirdly, it is important to specifically mention the good effect of physical labor on sleep. This point is very important. Everyone knows that sleep is a form of rest. Sleeping pills can certainly make insomniacs fall asleep, but according to Soviet scientists' animal experiments, sleep induced by large doses of sleeping pills cannot achieve the effect of real sleep. Moreover, relying on drugs for a long time without treating insomnia is not a fundamental solution after all. Only after physical labor, when the limbs are tired, but the spirit is very calm, does it often easily induce sleepiness, and after falling asleep, one often sleeps very deeply and sweetly, and the symptoms of insomnia disappear naturally.

    In addition, the good air and relatively regular life in the countryside are also favorable conditions.

    I hope that neurasthenia patients will strive to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, happily engage in physical labor, and not miss this good opportunity to go down to the countryside!

    神经衰弱和下放
    王壹
    一位经常找我开方要安眠药和头痛药的朋友，忽然好长时间没有来。我正在百般猜测，他却上我家来了。一进门，他抢着便说：“大夫，我可永不再来麻烦你了，下放医好了我的病。我到农村才一个多月，现在一上床就能睡着，头也不痛了，……”。我一打量他，果然精神勃勃、红光满面，全不似先前那副萎糜不振、呵欠连连的模样了。
    他原是个神经衰弱患者，已经足有一年以上离开安眠药就不能入睡了。我也曾劝他去从事一时期的体力劳动，可惜没有条件。如今党提出干部下放政策，依我这神经科医生看来，这政策是一服空前的良方，不仅能医治思想上的病，还能医好神经衰弱症。
    神经衰弱这病由来已久。我国古代名医张仲景所描写的百合病，就很像这病。外国从十八世纪开始，对这病也有了广泛的记载和讨论。但是，直到巴甫洛夫学说发展以后，这个病的真相才弄清楚。
    原来，神经衰弱是大脑皮层的高级神经活动过度紧张而失调，一时不能恢复正常的功能所致。工作过度繁重而没有适当休息，过度的悲恸、忧伤、恐惧和焦虑不安，以及长时期压抑自己的情感等等，都可以引起神经衰弱。从统计上看，知识分子患这病的最多，因为他们大都是脑力劳动者，所以人们又称它为“知识分子职业病”。这病的症状是多种多样、千变万化的，有人突出地感到精神萎糜、全身无力等，有人却以记忆力减退、心跳、气短或遗精、早泄为最突出，但差不多都有失眠和头痛等共同症状。无论那种症状，都有它的病理生理基础，这和思想问题是不能混为一谈的。
    治疗神经衰弱的方法很多，譬如各种药物疗法、针灸、水疗、泥疗、氧气浴、组织疗法、睡眠疗法等，但都有一定的使用范围，而且受着一定条件的限制，并不是每一个神经衰弱病人都适用的。只有体力劳动疗法，除开病情严重（躺倒不起）者外，适用于一般神经衰弱患者，特别是有利于失眠的治疗。因为，治疗神经衰弱的原则，除了消除引起这病的原因外，主要是使大脑皮层得到充分的休息，以便恢复它的正常功能。适当的体力劳动正是最能收到这种成效的一种方法。
    首先，对脑力劳动者来说，适当的体力劳动，同经常性的体育锻炼一样，是一种“积极性的休息”，是“神经细胞在做体操”（巴甫洛夫语）。它不但可以增进大脑的分析和综合能力，促进大脑的新陈代谢作用，改善大脑的营养情况，使脑的功能得到调整；同时可以使内脏器官的活动能力加强，身体各部的联系更加协调，而这反过来又会促进神经系统的健康。
    其次，体力劳动在肉体上的艰苦性，可以培养人具备坚强、勇敢、机智、果断、有信心、有耐心等各种品质，以及集体主义和革命乐观主义的精神。这对神经衰弱的治疗也起着很大的作用。
    再次，要专门提一提体力劳动对睡眠的良好作用，这一点很重要。谁都知道，睡眠是一种休息。安眠药固然能使失眠者入睡，但据苏联科学家从动物实验证明，大量安眠药引起的睡眠，并不能起到真正睡眠所起的作用。况且长期依靠药不去治疗失眠，终究不是根本办法。只有体力劳动过后，肢体累了，精神却很平静，因而常常容易引起睡意，而且入睡后又往往睡得很熟很香，失眠症状自然而然消失。
    此外，农村空气好，生活比较有规律，也都是有利条件。
    我愿神经衰弱患者争先恐后地上山下乡，愉快地进行体力劳动，莫放过下放这个好机会！
