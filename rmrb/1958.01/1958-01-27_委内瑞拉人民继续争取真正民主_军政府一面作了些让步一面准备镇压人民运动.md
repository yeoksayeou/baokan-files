Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, January 26th: Following the overthrow of the Jiménez dictatorship, the Venezuelan people are continuing to fight for the establishment of a truly democratic regime throughout the country. A mass rally with many participants was held in Caracas. At the meeting, representatives of the "Patriotic Civic Committee" spoke, calling on all sectors of the Venezuelan people to maintain unity and strive to hold truly democratic elections nationwide in the shortest possible time to elect a national parliament and government.

According to the "New York Times," the "Patriotic Civic Committee" includes representatives from four parties: the Republican Democratic Union, the Communist Party of Venezuela, Democratic Action, and the left-wing members of the Christian Social Party. All four of these parties were declared illegal during the Jiménez dictatorship.

The people's struggle has now risen to such a level that the military government committee has had to make some revisions to its original attempts to limit democratic reforms in Venezuela. To this end, after announcing the removal of two committee members accused of helping the Jiménez regime oppose the mass uprising, the military government committee ordered the dissolution of the secret police and replaced them with the army to take over the city's police force. However, this measure by the military government committee was only taken under duress after the insurgent masses stormed the headquarters of the secret police and threatened to occupy it.

In addition, the military government committee also announced that workers and staff who participated in the strike movement against the Jiménez regime would continue to receive their wages, that those in the government who had cooperated with the Jiménez regime would be dismissed, that a general amnesty for political prisoners would be declared, and that preparations would be made to try those in the dictatorial regime who had committed the most heinous crimes. At the same time, the military government committee began preparing to suppress the people's movement. The head of the military government committee, Larrazábal, has ordered the conscription of reservists, the continuation of martial law in Caracas, and the military government's troops have also used force against the people, injuring 160 people since the establishment of the military government committee.

    委内瑞拉人民继续争取真正民主
    军政府一面作了些让步一面准备镇压人民运动
    新华社26日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉人民群众在推翻了希门尼斯的独裁政权之后，现在正继续为在全国建立一个真正的民主政权而斗争。在加拉加斯举行了一个有许多人参加的群众大会。在会上，“公民爱国委员会”的代表讲了话，号召委内瑞拉各阶层人民保持团结，争取在最短时间内，在全国举行真正的民主选举，选出全国的议会和政府。
    据“纽约时报”报道，参加“公民爱国委员会”的有四个党派的代表，它们是：共和民主联盟、委内瑞拉共产党、民主行动党和基督教社会党的左翼成员。这四个政党在希门尼斯独裁专政时期，都曾被宣布为非法。
    现在人民群众的斗争已经高涨到这样的程度，以致军政府委员会不得不对它原来打算限制委内瑞拉民主改革的企图，作出某些修改。为此，军政府委员会在宣布撤除了两名被指责帮助过希门尼斯政权反对群众起义的委员会成员以后，又下令解散秘密警察，用陆军来接管全城警察。但是军政府委员会这个措施只是在起义群众冲进了秘密警察总部、并且威胁要占领秘密警察总部的情况下，被迫采取的。
    此外，军政府委员会还宣布，在反对希门尼斯政权的罢工运动期间的工人和职员的工薪照发，开除政府中同希门尼斯政权合作过的人，宣布大赦政治犯以及准备审判独裁政权中罪大恶极的人。同时，军政府委员会开始准备镇压人民运动。军政府委员会的首脑拉腊萨巴耳已经下令征募后备军，在加拉加斯继续实行戒严，军政府的军队还用武力对付人民群众，在军政府委员会成立以来，已经有一百六十人被打伤。
