Wuhan Iron and Steel Builders Use Revolutionary Spirit to Overcome All Difficulties
    Guaranteeing No. 1 Blast Furnace Will Be Put Into Production This Year

    (Our newspaper's Wuhan, 3rd dispatch, correspondent Xiao Ding reports:) The builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation are determined to use a revolutionary spirit to overcome all difficulties and guarantee that No. 1 Blast Furnace will be put into production within 1958, responding to the Central Committee's call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years.

    In 1958, Wuhan Iron and Steel's construction entered a new period of comprehensive crossover between civil engineering and installation, with the installation workload exceeding civil engineering. At the same time, No. 1 Blast Furnace and its corresponding mining, mineral processing, sintering, coking, power facilities, and auxiliary facilities systems will be partially completed or put into production. Therefore, this year's construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel will be an unprecedentedly busy year, with total investment increasing by more than 70% compared to 1957, exceeding the total investment of the first Five-Year Plan.

    According to the overall progress of No. 1 Blast Furnace, about 70% of the entire blast furnace system's tasks are concentrated in 1958. At the same time, there are significant difficulties in design, equipment, and construction that must be resolved through various means. To adapt to this new situation, the company included the first and second quarters in the construction peak when formulating the 1958 plan, with the workload accounting for 60% of the annual plan, ensuring the construction period of No. 1 Blast Furnace from the plan. This is a major reform that fundamentally changes the old pattern of construction enterprises, which have historically experienced idleness in the first quarter, light work in the second quarter, rushing work in the third quarter, and frantic work in the fourth quarter. In terms of design, in addition to strengthening contact with foreign countries, the company also adopted a policy of classifying, prioritizing, and coordinating overall when addressing design modification issues. Any design modifications that conflict with construction progress or production will be resolutely stopped. Regarding the equipment problem, which is currently the most difficult, the company is conducting a comprehensive review and making every effort to absorb various domestic and foreign experiences to appropriately arrange the construction period to ensure supply. Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, and Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute, which are responsible for the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel, have decided to comprehensively merge and change the system, implement unified leadership, and divide responsibilities according to the engineering system. Leaders will go deep into the construction site to solve problems on the spot.

    武钢建设者用革命气概克服一切困难
    保证一号高炉今年投入生产
    本报武汉3日电　通讯员萧定报道：武汉钢铁公司的建设者决心用革命的精神，克服一切困难，保证一号高炉在1958年年内投入生产，响应中央提出的十五年赶上英国的号召。
    1958年，武钢的建设进入了土建、安装全面交叉的新时期，而且安装工作量大于土建。同时，一号高炉和相应的采矿、选矿、烧结、焦化，以及动力设施、辅助设施等系统都要部分建成或投入生产。所以，今年武钢的建设将是空前繁忙的一年，总投资比1957年增长了70％以上，比第一个五年计划的总和还多。
    根据一号高炉总进度，整个高炉系统还有70％左右的任务集中在1958年完成，同时，设计、设备和施工都存在很大困难，必须想各种办法来解决。为了适应这新形势，这个公司在编制1958年计划时，就把一、二季列入施工高峰，工作量占年计划60％，从计划上保证一号高炉的工期。这就是一个重大的改革，从根本上改变了建筑企业历年来一季窝工、二季闲工、三季赶工、四季抢工的旧规律。在设计上，他们除了采取加强与国外联系外，对于修改设计的问题，也采取分类排队、统筹兼顾的方针，凡是修改设计与施工进度、生产发生矛盾的，坚决停止修改。对目前困难最多的设备问题，这个公司正在进行全面清理，并且想尽一切办法，吸收国内外各种经验，适当安排工期，以便保证供应。担任武钢建设的武汉钢铁公司、武汉冶金建筑总公司和黑色冶金设计院武汉分院等甲、乙、丙方面，已经决定全面合并改变体制，实行统一领导，按工程系统分工负责。领导深入工地，在现场解决问题。
