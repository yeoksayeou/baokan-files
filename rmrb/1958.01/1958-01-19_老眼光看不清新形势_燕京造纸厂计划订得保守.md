Old Perspective Fails to See New Situation
Yanjing Paper Mill Sets Conservative Plan

(Reported by this newspaper) The Yanjing Paper Mill in Beijing has set a conservative production plan for this year.

The factory initially submitted a plan to the Beijing Second Local Industry Bureau for an output value of 17.38 million yuan, far short of the bureau's requirement of 21 million yuan. The Local Industry Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Second Local Industry Bureau both criticized the plan as being conservative. The factory's leading cadres then re-studied and discussed the matter, and the second submission to the bureau raised the output value to 19.9 million yuan, an increase of 2.52 million yuan over the first submission and a 15.96% increase over the estimated completed output value for last year. However, it was still conservative.

In 1955, due to the shortage of paper on the market, the factory had a tendency to neglect product quality, resulting in a backlog of products. Later, many measures were taken, and from the second half of 1956, product quality basically stabilized. When discussing the production plan this year, some people thought of the events of 1955 again, fearing that mentioning "more" and "faster" would affect quality, so they dared not propose an advanced production plan.

The factory's main product is letterpress paper for printing books and periodicals. In August and September of last year, sales of this type of paper were temporarily sluggish. When formulating this year's production plan, some people, based on this situation, believed that the output of letterpress paper in 1958 could only maintain last year's level and could not be increased. In fact, the situation in August and September last year was temporary. Currently, there is a lot of printing of books and documents in various places during the rectification campaign and the socialist education movement; with the development of the literacy campaign, the demand for letterpress paper will also increase. Moreover, from a national perspective, the quantity of paper is not too much, but rather insufficient.

These comrades also lacked sufficient consideration of the potential of the enterprise and, on the contrary, exaggerated the difficulties. For example, the machine speed (i.e., the rotation speed of the paper machine), which has a direct impact on increasing output, averaged 87 meters per second last year and reached a maximum of 90 meters per second. However, when these comrades initially formulated the plan this year, they only set it at 85 meters. They emphasized that the machine quality was not very good and that the technology was poor, fearing that speeding up the machine would cause malfunctions. However, the Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Mill has the same machine equipment as them, and it is even older than theirs, but the machine speed has already reached more than 110 meters. The machine repair indicators in this year's plan are also lower than the actual level achieved last year. For example, the average monthly repair time for machine No. 3 last year was 25 hours, but this year it is set at 38 hours. Their reason is that although the repair time was short last year, some machines were not repaired on time, and the repair quality of some machines was not good enough. In fact, as long as efforts are made, these shortcomings can be overcome without increasing the repair time. Moreover, after the safety topic was freely aired and debated this year, safety accidents have been greatly reduced, and the repair time can be shortened. They did not fully estimate these favorable factors.

Now, after studying, the conservative thinking of some leading personnel in this factory has begun to change. Currently, they have sent people to other factories to learn, find advanced indicators, explore various favorable factors within the factory, and are about to hand over the plan to all workers for discussion, preparing to revise the plan to be as advanced as possible.

### 老眼光看不清新形势  燕京造纸厂计划订得保守

    老眼光看不清新形势
    燕京造纸厂计划订得保守
    本报讯　北京市燕京造纸厂今年的生产计划订得保守。
    这个厂最初报给北京市第二地方工业局的今年的计划产值，是一千七百三十八万元，同局里要求的两千一百万元相差很远。中共北京市委地方工业部和北京市第二地方工业局都批评这个计划是个保守计划。这个厂的领导干部又重新研究讨论，第二次报局的产值提高到一千九百九十万元，比第一次增加了二百五十二万元，比去年预计完成的产值增加15.96％，但是仍然是保守的。
    1955年，这个厂因为市场上纸张供不应求，曾经发生过忽视产品质量的偏向，结果积压了一批产品。后来采取许多措施，从1956年下半年起，产品质量基本上稳定了下来。今年讨论生产计划的时候，有些人又想起了1955年的事，恐怕一提多快，又会影响质量，因此不敢提出先进的生产计划。
    这个厂生产的主要品种是印刷书刊用的凸板纸。去年八、九月间，这种纸曾经有一度销路不够畅快。在制定今年生产计划的时候，有些人就根据这个情况，认为1958年凸板纸产量只能保持去年的水平不能再增产了。实际上，去年八、九月的情况是暂时的。目前，在整风和社会主义教育运动中，各地印书、印文件很多；随着扫盲运动的开展，凸板纸需要量也将增加。而且从全国来看，目前纸张数量不是太多，而是不足。
    这些同志对于企业的潜力也缺乏充分的考虑，相反地却夸大了困难的一面。例如对提高产量有直接影响的车速（即造纸机的转动数），去年平均达到了每秒八十七公尺，最多曾达到过九十公尺。但是，这些同志在今年最初订计划时，只订了八十五公尺。他们强调机器质量不太好，技术差，怕加快车速出故障。可是，上海江南造纸厂机器设备和他们是一样的，而且比他们的还旧，车速已经达到了一百一十多公尺。机器检修指标，今年的计划也比去年实际达到的水平低。如三号机去年平均每月检修时间是二十五小时，今年却订为三十八小时。他们的理由是：去年检修时间虽短，但是有的机器没有按时检修，有的机器检修质量不够好。其实，只要经过努力，不增加检修时间，这些缺点也可以克服。而且今年经过安全专题鸣放以后，安全事故已经大大减少，检修时间可以缩短。这些有利因素，他们都没有充分估计。
    现在经过学习，这个厂的一部分领导人员的保守思想已开始扭转。目前，他们已派人到外厂学习，找先进指标，在厂内发掘各种有利因素，并且即将把计划交给全体工人讨论，准备把计划修订得尽可能的先进。
