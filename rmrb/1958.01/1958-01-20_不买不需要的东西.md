    Don't Buy Things You Don't Need
    Our school spent more than 300 yuan to buy two leather rocking horses, and another 800 or 900 yuan to buy a set of iron basketball hoops. I think that after the leadership called for running the school diligently and thriftily, the students actively responded and took the initiative to repair the uneven dirt roads in the school into cinder roads, collecting firewood and picking up coal cinders, which was praised by the leadership. Our school already bought a leather rocking horse, and we haven't even played on it once. Why did we buy two more? Our school has many basketball hoops, why did we buy another set of iron hoops? We shouldn't buy things we don't need.

    不买不需要的东西
    我校用三百多元买了两个皮木马，又花八、九百元买了一付铁篮球架。我想当领导上号召勤俭办校后，同学们积极响应了，主动地把校内各处高低不平的土路修为煤碴路，拾柴拣煤核，得到了领导上的表扬。我校已经买了一个皮木马，我们连一次也没玩过，为啥又买了两个呢？我们学校球架也不少，为啥又买一付铁球架呢？我们不应该买不需要的东西。
