A Good Way to Accelerate the Greening of Barren Mountains
    Concentrate Efforts to Plant Trees on a Large Scale
    Pinggu County Adopts This Method, One Year's Afforestation Equals the Past Six Years
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Pinggu County, Hebei Province, has greatly accelerated the speed of greening barren mountains and wastelands by adopting the method of long-term preparation, short-term arrangement, and concentrating efforts on afforestation.
    Pinggu County, Hebei Province, is a semi-mountainous area with 800,000 mu of barren mountains, accounting for 62% of the county's total area. In the years after liberation, the speed of greening was very slow. In 1956, county leaders discovered that Nanshan Village had adopted the method of long-term preparation, short-term arrangement, and concentrated efforts on afforestation. Over the years, they had planted more than 6,000 mu of trees and more than 30,000 fruit trees, which were growing well. Therefore, the leaders of Pinggu County decided to conduct pilot projects in Zhanggezhuang Township and Donggaocun Township in 1956, adopting the method of concentrating efforts on afforestation to create a "10,000-mu forest." Before afforestation, county leaders and township cadres personally took action to advance agricultural work in a planned way, organize manpower to measure afforestation sites, select tree species, and prepare seeds. At the same time, relying on the Communist Youth League and women's organizations, they used meetings, broadcasts, blackboards, individual visits, and contracted sections to carry out publicity, raising the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation. Three days before afforestation, the afforestation land was divided into sections and areas by team and group, and 80 people, including the heads of each team and township and commune cadres, were organized to go to the mountains to learn afforestation techniques to ensure the quality of afforestation. During the afforestation, the county magistrate and the county party secretary personally took charge and participated in the afforestation. Because the ideological work was thorough and the organizational work was meticulous, the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation was unprecedentedly high, and the work efficiency was also very high. The young people collected seeds themselves, donated seeds, cooked meals in the middle of the night, and went to the mountains at three or four o'clock in the morning. More than 7,000 people from the two townships participated in afforestation (accounting for 65% of the total labor force), and completed 13,000 mu in three days, exceeding the original plan by 30%. The survival rate of this afforestation reached more than 80%.
    In 1957, the county promoted the experience of concentrating efforts on large-scale afforestation, and organized cadres from various townships and communes to visit Nanshan Village's young forest management and intercropping of grain and trees. The county organized more than 46,000 people, and according to the spirit of afforesting the sunny slopes first, then the shady slopes, and wherever it thaws first, they took action in advance, and in just five days, they afforested 52,391 mu on the mountains and river valleys, exceeding the original plan by 64%; in addition, 1.6 million trees were planted around houses, exceeding the original plan by 69%. Seven townships, including Zhanggezhuang, completed three 10,000-mu forests, greening 113-li-long riverbanks and 58-li-long Zhenluoying mountains. The amount of afforestation in 1957 was equal to the total amount of afforestation in the six years from 1950 to 1955.
    When the "10,000-mu forest" was first proposed, some people doubted that concentrating a large amount of labor to afforest a large area in a few days could not guarantee quality. However, the experience of 1956 and 1957 proves that the quality of afforestation depends on preparation. Take 20 days to a month to make full preparations before afforestation. Once the afforestation time arrives, the whole people can be mobilized to adopt a large-scale battle method to concentrate on afforestation. This is not only convenient for leadership, but also boosts the morale of the masses; it is not only fast, but also of good quality, and the chaos of the so-called "afforestation rush" in the past will not occur. At the same time, because the teams and groups responsible for fixed sections are divided, the original teams and groups are still responsible for nurturing and protecting after afforestation, which avoids the phenomenon of no one being responsible and no forests being seen after afforestation. Concentrating efforts on large-scale afforestation can not only grasp the afforestation season and increase the survival rate, but also promote the early completion of agricultural work by arranging agricultural work in a unified way in advance. For example, Angu Village in Zhanggezhuang Township rushed to plant more than 600 mu of wheat fields three days in advance for afforestation.
    The achievements of large-scale afforestation in the past two years have greatly increased the confidence of leaders and the masses in greening barren mountains. If we follow the speed of small-scale sporadic tree planting in the past, it will be difficult to green the county's barren mountains by 1972; at the current speed, all the barren mountains that can be greened in the county can be greened by 1961.
    In 1958, Pinggu County plans to afforest 85,000 mu, striving to complete five "10,000-mu forests" and thirteen "1,000-mu forests," greening the 60-li-long Cuo River, and completing greening around houses throughout the county.

    加速绿化荒山的一个好办法
    集中力量大面积造林
    平谷县采取这个办法一年造林数量等于过去六年
    本报讯　河北省平谷县采取长准备、短安排、集中力量造林的办法，大大加速了绿化荒山荒地的速度。
    河北省平谷县是个半山区，全县有荒山八十万亩，占全县总面积的62％。解放后几年来，绿化速度很慢。1956年，县领导方面发现了南山村采取了长准备、短安排、集中力量造林的方法，几年来共造林六千多亩、果树三万来棵，生长良好。于是，平谷县领导方面决定1956年在张各庄乡和东高村乡进行试点，采取集中力量造林的方法营造一个“万亩林”。在造林前，县领导干部和乡干部亲自动手，有计划地把农活提前，组织人力测量造林地点，选择树种，准备种子。同时依靠青年团和妇女组织，利用开会、广播、黑板报、个别访问、分片包干等形式进行宣传，提高群众的造林热情。在造林前三天，把造林地按队、组划段划片，并组织各队负责人和乡干社干八十人上山，学习造林技术，以保证造林质量。造林的时候，县长和县委书记都亲自挂帅，参加造林。由于思想工作做的透彻，组织工作做得严密，群众造林热情空前高涨，工作效率也很高。青年们自己采种子、献种子，半夜做饭，三、四点钟就上山。两乡有七千多人参加了造林（占总劳力的65％），三天就完成一万三千亩，超过原计划30％。这次造的林，成活率达80％以上。
    1957年全县又推广了这种集中力量大面积造林的经验，并组织各乡各社干部参观了南山村的幼林抚育和粮林混作。全县共组织了四万六千多人，根据先阳坡，后阴坡，哪里先解冻哪里就造林的精神，提前行动，只用五天时间就在山上、河谷造林五万二千三百九十一亩，超过原计划64％；此外，四旁植树一百六十万株，超过原计划69％。张各庄等七个乡就完成了三个万亩林，绿化了长达一百一十三里的沟河两岸、五十八里的镇罗营山川。1957年造林数量，等于1950到1955年六年造林数量的总和。
    在开始提出“万亩林”的时候，有人怀疑集中大量劳力在几天内大面积造林不能保证质量。可是，1956、1957两年的经验证明，造林质量的好坏决定于准备工作。在造林前拿出二十天到一个月的时间进行充分准备。造林时间一到，就可以全民出动，采取大兵团作战方式，集中造林。这样既便于领导，群众劲头也足；不但速度快，而且质量好，不会发生过去所谓“造林一窝蜂”的混乱现象。同时，由于划分了负责固定地段的队、组，造林后仍由原队原组负责抚育、保护，这就避免了造林后无人负责、造林不见林的现象。集中力量大面积造林，不但可以掌握造林季节，成活率高，同时由于提前统一安排农活，还推动了农活提前完成。例如张各庄乡安固村为了造林，就提前三天抢种六百多亩麦田。
    两年来大面积造林的成就，大大地增加了领导干部和群众绿化荒山的信心。如果按照过去小面积零星植树的速度，到1972年也难以把全县荒山绿化；按现在的速度，只要到1961年就可以把全县可能绿化的荒山全部绿化。
    1958年平谷县计划造林八万五千亩，争取完成五个“万亩林”、十三个“千亩林”，绿化长六十里的错河，并将在全县完成四旁绿化。
