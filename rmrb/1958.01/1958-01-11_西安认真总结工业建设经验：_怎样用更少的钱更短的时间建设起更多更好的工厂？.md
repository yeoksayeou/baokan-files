    Xi'an Conscientiously Summarizes Industrial Construction Experience:
    How to Build More and Better Factories with Less Money and in Less Time?
    (Our Dispatch) Xi'an is summarizing one of the important questions from the experiences of construction during the First Five-Year Plan: how to spend less money and use less time to build more and better factories.
    Xi'an is one of the key cities for industrial construction in our country. During the First Five-Year Plan, dozens of large-scale industrial enterprises were newly built and expanded, which greatly changed the face of this ancient city and added a large amount of production capacity for the country. In such a large-scale industrial construction, the vast number of cadres, workers, and technicians have gained rich experience, and a large number of basic construction talents have grown up.
    In order to accept the lessons of past experience, so as to carry out the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan more, faster, better, and more economically, in November last year, Xi'an City formed a working group composed of the city's party and government leading organs to summarize the construction experience during the First Five-Year Plan. As early as the second quarter of last year, units such as the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the State Construction Commission, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry also sent people to Xi'an to conduct a general inspection of some key factories that had been built and were under construction, in the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, and appropriately revised the factory construction plans of some factories. After that, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed each factory to transfer forces to conduct a detailed review of the design and factory construction plans item by item, further discover problems, and tap production potential. In this way, the foundation was laid for conducting a city-wide summary.
    In the summary, the relevant units fully estimated the great achievements made in construction, and at the same time, did not avoid revealing the shortcomings in the work. For example, in the process of building these new factories, the unified arrangement and cooperation were insufficient, resulting in each doing its own thing, wasting manpower and material resources. Also, the architectural standards of many factories were too high and the area was too large, thus using more construction funds. These shortcomings were mainly caused by the lack of construction experience in the past, and many were unavoidable.
    Many factories under construction have already modified the original factory construction plan in accordance with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, according to the experience and lessons learned in the summary. For example, the factories under construction have accepted the lessons learned from the experience of early equipment installation and early arrival of personnel in the newly built factories, and began to adopt the method of simultaneous construction and production. In this way, some products can be produced earlier to supply the needs of the country, technical strength and management ability can be exercised, and some expenses can be solved by themselves. Many factories have modified the design according to the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, appropriately lowered the architectural standards, and strengthened cooperation with neighboring brother factories.

    西安认真总结工业建设经验：
    怎样用更少的钱更短的时间建设起更多更好的工厂？
    本报讯　在工业建设中，如何花更少的代价，用更短的时间，建设起更多更好的工厂，这是西安地区总结第一个五年计划建设经验的重要问题之一。
    西安是我国工业建设的重点城市之一，在第一个五年计划期间，新建和扩建了几十个大型工业企业，使这座古城的面貌有了重大的改变，为国家增加了大量的生产能力。在这样大规模的工业建设中，广大干部和工人、技术人员取得了丰富的经验，大批基本建设人材成长起来。
    为了接受过去的经验教训，以便更多、更快、更好、更省地进行第二个五年计划的建设，西安市在去年11月份，由全市党、政领导机关组成了工作组，对第一个五年计划期间的建设经验进行总结。早在去年第二季度，国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、国家建设委员会、电机工业部等单位也派人到西安，根据勤俭建国的精神对一些已经建成和正在建设的重点工厂进行了普遍的检查，并且适当地修改了一些工厂的建厂方案。此后，中共西安市委又指示各厂，抽调力量对设计和建厂方案逐项进行了详细的审查，进一步发现问题，挖掘生产潜力。这样，就为进行全市范围的总结打下了基础。
    各有关单位在总结中充分估计了建设中取得的巨大成就，同时也没有回避对工作中缺点的揭露。如在建设这些新厂的过程中，统一安排和协作不够，结果各搞一套，浪费了人力物力。又如许多工厂的建筑标准偏高，面积偏大，因而多用了一些建设资金。这些缺点主要是由过去建设经验不足而造成的，有很多是不可避免的。
    很多正在建设的工厂已经根据总结中提出的经验教训，按照多、快、好、省的精神，适当修改了原订的建厂方案。例如，正在建设的各厂都接受了新建成的工厂部分设备安装过早和人员到厂过早的经验教训，开始采取一边建设一边生产的办法。这样，可以早些生产出部分产品供应国家需要，可以锻炼技术力量和管理能力，又可以自己解决一部分开支。有不少工厂根据勤俭建国的精神修改了设计，适当降低了建筑标准，加强了同邻近的兄弟厂的协作。
