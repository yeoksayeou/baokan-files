Eliminating Schistosomiasis Can Increase Lifespan and Land Productivity
Hunan Treats 90,000 Patients and Eliminates Large Numbers of Snails in Two Years

    (Our report) Hunan Province has vigorously carried out schistosomiasis prevention and control work. In the past two years, it has treated 90,000 schistosomiasis patients. Many townships and communes have basically eliminated schistosomiasis and snails, greatly promoting the development of agricultural production in these areas.

    In 1956, after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the schistosomiasis-endemic areas of Hunan Province, under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, actively carried out large-scale schistosomiasis prevention and control work and preventive measures such as managing manure and water, achieving "maximum control of infection, universal reduction of the epidemic, and gradual compression of the epidemic area." In the past two years, the province has treated 90,000 patients; snail elimination has been carried out on more than one million mu of snail-infested areas, and more than 100,000 mu have basically no snails; one county and two townships have basically eliminated schistosomiasis; more than 20 townships have basically eliminated snails; 55 townships, 384 communes, 15 market towns, and 3,341 boat-dwelling households have basically achieved manure management, safe water protection, and individual protection. Last spring, when harvesting lake grass, schistosomiasis prevention and control work teams provided personal protection for 210,000 migrant workers, reducing and avoiding infection with schistosomiasis.

    In the past, in some areas of Hunan Province, due to the severe harm of schistosomiasis, the large-scale damage to the rural labor force, and the large number of deaths, agricultural production was severely hindered. In some areas, there were even tragic scenes of families being destroyed, people dying, and fields lying barren. According to a survey in the first half of 1956, among the 570,000 patients in the province, about 10,000 late-stage patients had completely lost their labor force, 190,000 mid-stage and symptomatic patients had suffered some degree of damage to their labor force, and more than 370,000 early-stage patients' labor force was also gradually affected. A survey in Xiangyin County showed that among the 60,000 patients in the county, there were 48,100 male and female laborers aged 14 to 19, accounting for 80% of the total number of patients.

    Due to the province's active efforts in schistosomiasis prevention and control, many people have avoided and reduced infection with schistosomiasis, rescued and protected the labor force, and also promoted the development of agricultural production. All late-stage ascites patients in the province have been basically treated, and 87% of the patients have regained their labor force. Qiu Deren, a patient in Ma Kuang Township, Yueyang County, had lost his labor force for seven years. After treatment, he was able to carry a 100-jin load and walk ten li back and forth, and now he earns ten work points every day. Qingtan Township in Xiangyin County added 218 laborers last year. In Xiangyin County, 656 schistosomiasis patients in 109 agricultural production cooperatives have regained their labor force after treatment. According to a survey of 46 agricultural production cooperatives, after recovering their health through treatment, 64 households with 269 people were transformed from "five guarantees" households to self-sufficient households. These cooperatives reduced their burden by more than 147,900 jin in grain alone. For example, Li Dongsheng, a poor peasant member of the Gonghe Cooperative in Saitou Township, had five people in his family and became a "five guarantees" household due to schistosomiasis. The cooperative subsidized his family a total of 176 yuan the year before last. After he was cured of schistosomiasis, he worked a total of 150 workdays in nine months last year and accumulated more than 200 dan of fertilizer. His family has now bought back all their grain and no longer needs the cooperative's "five guarantees." Through actively preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, the Dunshang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mi Shui Township increased its attendance rate from 50% to 90%, changing the phenomenon of failing to complete production plans in previous years. Last year, Xiangyin County combined weeding, snail elimination, and fertilizer accumulation to reach more than 2.3 million dan. Qingtan, Yingtian, and Shikuang Townships in the county reclaimed wasteland to eliminate snails on more than 3,700 mu the winter before last. Rapeseed was planted in these areas, and more than 192,000 jin of rapeseed were harvested last year. Han Gongdu Township in Changde reclaimed wasteland to eliminate snails on 2,000 mu the winter before last, and harvested 160,000 jin of rapeseed last year, and planted 1,300 mu of sorghum, harvesting 260,000 jin of sorghum last year.

    The broad masses of cadres and peasants in the schistosomiasis-endemic areas of Hunan Province have been educated by the facts and have raised their understanding of schistosomiasis prevention and control work. Many peasants say that prevention and control work guarantees "increased lifespan and increased land productivity."

    消灭血吸虫病可以使人增寿地增产
    湖南两年来治疗九万病人消灭大量钉螺
    本报讯　湖南省大力开展血吸虫病防治工作，两年来共治疗血吸虫病患者九万人，有许多乡、社已经基本上消灭了血吸虫病和钉螺，大大促进了这些地区农业生产的发展。
    1956年，全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，湖南省的血吸虫病疫区，在各级党委的统一领导下，积极开展了大规模的防治血吸虫病工作和管粪管水等预防工作，做到了“尽量控制感染、普遍减轻疫情、逐步压缩疫区”。两年来全省共治疗了九万病人；在一百多万亩钉螺面积上进行了灭螺，有十多万亩已经基本上没有钉螺；有一个县和两个乡基本上消灭了血吸虫病；有二十多个乡基本上消灭了钉螺；有五十五个乡、三百八十四个社、十五个集镇和三千三百四十一户船民已经基本上做到管理粪便、保护用水安全和个体防护工作。去年春季打湖草时，防治血吸虫病工作组对二十一万民工做了个人防护工作，使民工减少和避免了感染血吸虫病。
    过去湖南省有些地区由于血吸虫病的严重危害，农村劳动力的大量损害和人口的大量死亡，给农业生产带来了严重的阻碍，个别地区甚至出现家破人亡、田园荒芜的惨痛景象。据1956年上半年调查，全省五十七万病人中，有一万左右晚期病人已全部丧失劳动力，有十九万中期和有症状的病人劳动力已遭到一定程度的损害，三十七万多早期病人劳动力也逐渐受到影响。湘阴县调查，全县六万病人中，十四岁一十九岁的男女劳动力就有四万八千一百多人，占病人总数的80％。
    由于全省积极开展血吸虫病的防治工作，使许多人避免和减少了感染血吸虫病，抢救和保护了劳动力，也促进了农业生产的发展。全省的晚期腹水病人已经基本上治疗完毕，有87％的病人恢复了劳动力。岳阳县麻圹乡病人丘德仁丧失劳动力已经七年，治疗后能挑一百斤担子走十里路打回转，现在每天做十个工分。湘阴青潭乡去年增加劳动力二百一十八个。湘阴县一百零九个农业生产合作社有六百五十六个血吸虫病患者经过治疗恢复了劳动力。据四十六个农业生产合作社的调查，经过治疗恢复健康以后，由五保户转为自食其力的有六十四户二百六十九人，仅口粮一项，这些社就减少负担十四万七千九百多斤。如赛头乡共和社贫农社员李冬生，全家五口人，由于患血吸虫病成了五保户，前年社里共救济他家一百七十六元，他治愈血吸虫病以后，去年九个月共出工一百五十个，积肥二百多担，他家的口粮已全部买回，再不要社里五保了。汨水乡墩上农业生产合作社通过积极防治血吸虫病，全社出勤率由50％上升到90％，改变了历年完不成生产计划的现象。湘阴县去年结合铲草灭螺积肥二百三十多万担，该县青潭、营田、石圹等乡前年冬天结合生产开荒消灭钉螺三千七百多亩，这些地方都种了油菜，去年收油菜籽十九万二千多斤。常德韩公渡乡前年冬天开荒灭螺二千亩，去年收油菜籽十六万斤，种高粱一千三百亩，去年收高粱二十六万斤。
    湖南省血吸虫病疫区的广大干部和农民群众在事实面前受到了教育，提高了对血吸虫病防治工作的认识，许多农民说，防治工作保证“人增寿，地增产”。
