Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 17th. Since last autumn, Xiangyang Special District in Hubei Province has launched a mass, large-scale water conservancy construction movement, achieving a great leap forward in solving the key issue of increasing production. Based on this new situation, the Xiangyang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently planned and determined to complete the grain and cotton production increase targets originally planned for the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1958. This means that the total grain output of the district will increase from 4 billion jin in 1957 to 7 billion jin, and cotton production will increase by 50% compared to 1957.

Since the special district proposed the principle of "self-raising, self-repairing, self-using, and self-managing" to run water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily last autumn, a high tide of mass water conservancy construction has rapidly formed, fully embodying the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical." According to local plans, a total of more than 120,000 large and small water conservancy projects and more than 20,000 canals will be built in the district this winter and spring, with a total length of 40,000 kilometers. In the past three months, the number of people participating in water conservancy construction every day has reached more than 1.7 million. Thanks to the hard work of the broad masses and cadres, great achievements have been made. According to statistics from early January, more than 10,000 large and small canals, and more than 26,000 reservoirs, ponds, and wells have been completed in the district. These completed water conservancy projects can convert 3 million mu of dry land into paddy fields, improve irrigation for 1.5 million mu, and increase the guaranteed harvest area of 2 million mu. These projects are seven times larger than last year, but the state investment is only 5.74 million yuan, which is 1.7 million yuan less than last year. Jun County, known for its thrifty water conservancy efforts, completed the Guanshan River project, which is 400 li long and can irrigate 400,000 mu of farmland, with only 50,000 yuan of state investment. The newly built Juji Canal in Nanzhang County is more than 200 li long and can irrigate 300,000 mu of farmland. This canal project is large and arduous, requiring passage through 43 mountains, drilling 5 mountain tunnels, crossing 32 ditches, and 23 li of the canal must be carved out of stone, but it only requires about 40,000 yuan of state investment.

    襄阳专区水利大跃进带来了生产大跃进
    今年要达到五年后粮棉增产指标
    粮食从四十亿斤跃增到七十亿斤，棉花跃增50％
    据新华社武汉17日电　湖北省襄阳专区自去年秋天以来，开展了群众性的大规模的兴修水利运动，在解决增产的关键问题上有了大跃进。中共襄阳地委根据这一新的情况，最近规划确定，把原来计划在第二个五年计划最后一年达到的粮、棉增产指标，提前在1958年完成。这就是全区粮食总产量将由1957年的四十亿斤增加到七十亿斤，棉花比1957年增产50％。
    这个专区自从去年秋天提出了“自筹、自修、自用、自管”的勤俭办水利的方针后，群众兴修水利的高潮迅速形成，并且充分体现了“多、快、好、省”的方针。根据各地规划，去冬今春全区兴修的大小水利工程共达十二万多处，渠道两万多条，这些渠道的总长度达四万公里。近三个月来，每天参加修水利的人数达一百七十多万。由于广大群众和干部艰苦奋斗，目前已获得了巨大成绩。据1月上旬统计，全区已完成大小渠道一万多条，水库、塘堰、水井二万六千多处。这些已完成的水利工程就可改旱地为水田三百万亩；改水浇地一百五十万亩，并且能增加二百万亩田的保收面积。这些工程比去年大七倍，但国家投资只有五百七十四万元，比去年还少一百七十万元。以勤俭办水利著称的均县，修了一个长达四百里，可灌田四十万亩的官山河大工程，仅仅由国家投资五万元就完成了。南漳县新修的九集大渠，全长二百多里，可灌田三十万亩。这条渠工程大而且艰巨，要通过四十三座山，钻五个山洞，穿三十二条沟，而且有二十三里完全要开石成渠，但只用国家投资四万元左右。
