    A Voice of Reason
    People's Daily Commentator

    Nine thousand two hundred scientists from forty-four countries have jointly appealed to the United Nations, requesting the conclusion of an international agreement to halt atomic and nuclear bomb testing. This is an action with immense moral force.

    Scientists have high authority to speak on this issue; many of them have made significant contributions to the discovery of atomic energy. The appeal points out that nuclear bomb testing will increase the amount of radioactive elements around the world, which will cause damage to human health and future generations. The scientists' call to stop nuclear testing represents the voice of humanity's clear reason.

    For the sake of world peace, and for the health and welfare of mankind and future generations, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed to Western countries to halt nuclear testing. The scientists' appeal demonstrates how urgent the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing is. However, due to the fact that Western countries, especially the United States, care nothing for the lives and deaths of people for the profits of a few monopoly capitalists, and insist on a nuclear arms race, they have consistently refused to take such measures. Recently, U.S. President Eisenhower, in his reply to a letter from Soviet Premier Bulganin, still used the cessation of nuclear weapons production as a prerequisite for stopping nuclear testing. This has nothing in common with the wishes of people of all countries to immediately stop nuclear testing and ultimately abolish nuclear weapons.

    The forces demanding an end to the "Cold War" and a halt to the arms race are becoming wider and stronger. The appeal of authoritative scientists from various countries is a vivid example of the growing strength of this force. The ruling groups in Western countries, especially the United States, should calmly consider the wishes of the people of all countries.

    理智的呼声
    本报评论员
    四十四个国家的九千二百多名科学家联合向联合国发出呼吁，要求缔结国际协定以停止原子核炸弹的试验。这是一个具有极大道义力量的行动。
    科学家们在这个问题上是有很高的发言权威的，他们之中有很多人对于发现原子能的力量曾作出过重大的贡献。呼吁书指出，原子核炸弹试验会使世界各地的放射性元素的数量增加，这将给人类的健康和后代带来损害。科学家们提出停止核试验的呼吁是代表了人类清醒理智的呼声。
    为了世界和平的利益，也为了人类的健康和后代的福利，苏联已无数次向西方国家提出过停止核试验的建议。科学家们的呼吁，表明了停止核武器试验是一个何等迫切的问题，然而，由于西方国家，特别是美国，为了少数垄断资本家的利润，是不管人民死活的，坚持核备战竞赛，竟一直拒绝采取这种措施。最近，美国总统艾森豪威尔在答复苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信中，依然以停止核武器的生产作为停止核试验的先决条件。这是与各国人民要求立即停止核试验并最后废弃核武器的愿望毫无共同之处的。
    要求制止“冷战”和停止军备竞赛的力量是越来越广泛和强大了，各国权威的科学家们的呼吁，就是这种力量日益增长的一个鲜明的例证。西方国家，特别是美国的统治集团应当冷静地考虑一下各国人民的愿望了。
