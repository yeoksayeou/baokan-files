Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 3rd -- Egyptian President Nasser said on January 2nd that he hopes the proposed Egypt-Syria federation will be fully established before the end of 1958.

    He also said that Iraq could also join the federation if it withdraws from the Baghdad Pact and abrogates the Anglo-Iraqi Special Agreement.

    President Nasser made these remarks in an interview with a reporter from the newly established Lebanese "Al Kifah" newspaper. All Cairo newspapers published the interview today.

    President Nasser charged that the Anglo-Iraqi Special Agreement placed even more onerous obligations on Iraq than the Baghdad Pact.

    The Anglo-Iraqi Special Agreement was signed in April 1955. The agreement stipulated that Britain would train and equip the Iraqi army, and Iraq would provide Britain with military bases and all necessary supplies and facilities.

    President Nasser also said that Egypt is paying the greatest attention to strengthening its armed forces in order to counter the threat from Israel.

    He reiterated that the United Nations Emergency Force is stationed in Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula with Egypt's consent. Whether it will continue to fulfill its responsibilities depends on Egypt's opinion, and its future status will also be determined according to Egypt's policies.

    President Nasser also pointed out that Egypt's policy is based on cooperation with all countries while maintaining its independence and dignity. The reason for the breakdown in Egypt's relations with Western countries is due to their policy of exerting high pressure and aggression against Egypt.

    纳赛尔希望埃叙联邦在年内建成
    伊拉克如退出巴格达条约和废除英伊协定也可加入这个联邦
    新华社开罗3日电　埃及总统纳赛尔1月2日说，他希望拟议中的埃—叙联邦将在1958年年底以前完全建成。
    他还说，伊拉克也可以参加这个联邦，如果它退出巴格达条约，并且废除英伊特别协定的话。
    纳赛尔总统是在对新创办的黎巴嫩“斗争报”记者的谈话中这样说的。开罗所有的报纸今天都刊载了这篇谈话。
    纳赛尔总统指责说，英伊特别协定使伊拉克承担的义务比巴格达条约还要苛重。
    英伊特别协定是1955年4月签订的，协定规定由英国训练和装备伊拉克军队，伊拉克向英国提供军事基地和物质供应等一切便利。
    纳赛尔总统还说，埃及对于加强自己的武装部队给予最大的注意，以便对付以色列的威胁。
    他重申，联合国紧急部队是得到埃及的同意而驻在加沙和西奈半岛的。它是否要继续履行它的职责，要看埃及的意见而定，它未来的地位也要根据埃及的政策来决定。
    纳赛尔总统还指出，埃及的政策是建立在同一切国家进行合作，同时保持自己的独立和尊严的基础之上的。埃及同西方国家的关系之所以破裂，是由于它们对埃及实行高压政策和侵略。
