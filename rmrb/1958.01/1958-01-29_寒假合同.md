The Guangzhou Municipality middle school Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer organizations have formulated winter vacation activity plans.

The school Young Pioneer divisions universally place great importance on the Young Pioneers' review of schoolwork, actively organizing Young Pioneers to participate in public welfare labor and social service work. Many schools have stipulated that Young Pioneers go out to sweep the streets once a week, and also signed "winter vacation contracts" with the agricultural production cooperatives with which they regularly maintain contact during the semester, continuing to regularly engage in physical labor. Middle and small groups from some middle schools, such as the Fifth Middle School and the Thirty-third Middle School, have all "hooked up" with the Star Agricultural Production Cooperative. The Twenty-third Middle School also organized young people to help wash dishes and sell dim sum at the Lianxiang Teahouse.

    寒假合同
    广州市各中学团、队组织订出了寒假活动计划。
    各校队部普遍都很重视少年儿童的复习功课，积极组织少年儿童参加公益劳动和社会服务工作。许多学校都规定了少年儿童每周出动扫街一次，还与学期中经常联系的农业生产社订好了“寒假合同”，仍定期去进行体力劳动。五中、三十三中等一些中学里的中、小队都到明星农业生产社去挂上了“钩”。二十三中还组织了少年们到莲香茶楼去帮洗碗卖点心。
