Is Beauty the Idea of Beauty?
A Critique of Mr. Lü Ying's Aesthetic Views
Zhu Guangqian
Mr. Lü Ying's aesthetic views, as expressed in his article "What is Beauty" published in the People's Daily on December 3rd last year, are confused and self-contradictory.

His basic argument is: beauty is the "idea of beauty," the "concept of beauty," the "consciousness of beauty," the "aesthetic viewpoint." He also says that beauty is also "social consciousness." Clearly, he has not given a scientific and clear analysis of this pile of abstract nouns he uses, because these nouns cannot be completely identical in meaning.

First, let's talk about whether beauty is "social consciousness." As far as I understand it, his so-called "social consciousness" is generally known as "social ideology." Marx and Engels told us that literature and art are a kind of social ideology. Is beauty also a kind of social ideology? Lü Ying says it is, which is to regard beauty as an entity. He forgets that "beauty" was originally just an attribute of a certain entity. As an attribute, beauty cannot exist independently of the entity to which it belongs, let alone be said to be the entity itself. For example, the sentence, "a work of art is beautiful," is neither equivalent to saying, "beauty originally exists independently outside this work of art and then is added to it," nor is it equivalent to saying, "beauty is this work of art." Since beauty is an attribute of art, and art itself is a kind of social ideology, beauty (attribute) cannot simultaneously be a kind of social ideology (entity); it can only be ideological. This is just like saying "profiteering is a characteristic of the bourgeoisie", "the bourgeoisie is an exploiting class" and we cannot conclude "profiteering is the exploiting class", we can only say "profiteering is characteristic of the exploiting class". Therefore, Lü Ying's view of beauty as a "social consciousness" commits an obvious logical error. Behind this error, there are also two serious errors in aesthetic views. The first is that he substantizes "beauty," which is also to absolutize "beauty" (beauty can be separated from the entity to which it belongs and become an entity in itself). This is precisely Platonic objective idealism. Secondly, according to Lü Ying's view, the relationship between beauty and art has only two possibilities: either equating "beauty" and "art," or juxtaposing "beauty" and "art," because he denies that the relationship between art and beauty is the relationship between entity and attribute and affirms that both are entities. The former is exactly Croce's view (Croce believes that "art is beauty"), and the latter is similar to Tolstoy's view (Tolstoy denies that beauty is a characteristic of art). In either case, the error is very obvious.

Secondly, let's talk about "the consciousness of beauty." According to general usage, this refers to people's consciousness of beauty, that is, people are conscious of something being beautiful. In this sense, beauty certainly cannot be said to be "the consciousness of beauty," just as when the eyes see flowers, the vision caused by the eyes cannot be the flowers themselves. What Lü Ying refers to is probably still his so-called "social consciousness." Social consciousness cannot be beauty, as mentioned above, and "consciousness" and "social consciousness" cannot be equated either. Confusion in the use of words reflects confusion in thinking on the one hand, and can also lead to confusion in thinking on the other.

Third, "the idea of beauty" cannot be "the concept of beauty." "The concept of beauty" is a definition of beauty after scientific analysis. Our aesthetic discussions in the past two years are enough to prove that we have not yet obtained a clear "concept of beauty" that is generally recognized. But this does not prevent us from feeling that some things are beautiful, nor does it prevent us from having some views on beauty, thinking about what things are beautiful and what things are ugly. And this kind of view of beauty is exactly what Lü Ying calls "the idea of beauty" or "aesthetic viewpoint." This kind of "idea of beauty" is a part of the sum total of social ideology, that is to say, it is determined by the world view and class consciousness under certain historical conditions. Lü Ying vaguely recognizes the importance of social ideology to beauty, and we should acknowledge this advantage of his. However, his understanding in this area is still extremely confused. First, he did not see the distinction and relationship between social ideology as a whole and the "idea of beauty" as a part of it. He sometimes says that beauty is "the idea of beauty" and sometimes says that beauty is "social consciousness," as if the two can be equated. In this way, the part is equal to the whole. Obviously, not all social ideologies are beautiful, and the task of aesthetics is to find out the characteristics of the social ideology of beauty that are different from other social ideologies. Lü Ying's arbitrary interchange of the words "idea of beauty" and "social consciousness" conceals this problem. Secondly, the more important question is: is this kind of "idea of beauty" equal to "beauty"? Saying that the two are equal is tantamount to saying that "the idea of flowers" is equal to "flowers." Anyone can see that this is thorough subjective idealism. Even if you admit that "the idea of flowers" is determined by the objective world, this cannot save you from idealism, because you still affirm that consciousness (the idea of beauty) is existence (beauty), replacing existence with ideas. According to Lü Ying's logic, as long as there is "the idea of beauty," there is "beauty." We can lie in bed, close our eyes, and let "the idea of beauty" spin in our minds, and then artistic beauty, social beauty, natural beauty, etc., "all beauties are available to me." This is a remarkable invention!

But Lü Ying's point of view is too changeable. "Beauty is a kind of idea of people," the words are not finished, and then he says that beauty seems not to be a kind of idea of people. Listen, "People have seen many flowers in life, and the concept of the beauty of flowers has been formed, so a direct judgment can be made on whether the flowers are beautiful or not," "We usually use the word beauty not only to evaluate things in the natural world such as landscapes, flowers, and plants,... but mainly to evaluate social life and social things." From this, it can be seen that he also regards "the idea of beauty" as the standard of beauty, that is, the basis for "judging" or "evaluating" whether things are beautiful or not. Then "beauty" and "the idea of beauty" are two different things, because the ruler for measuring cloth cannot be the cloth being measured. Here, he is clearly self-contradictory.

Furthermore, is beauty measured according to the scale of "the idea of beauty"? Is beauty produced by "the idea of beauty"? We do not deny that "the idea of beauty" may affect beauty, but this is not a comprehensive objective fact. In many cases, the psychological process of a person discovering that a woman is beautiful or a musical tune is beautiful is very direct and without thinking. There is no comparison of her or it with his or her "idea of beauty". Conversely, there are also many people (especially aestheticians) who have a lot of clichés about how things can be beautiful, a lot of Lü Ying's so-called "ideas of beauty," but when it comes to concrete beautiful works of art, they know nothing and talk nonsense. These phenomena are what Lü Ying has not considered.

Lü Ying also exposes here that he holds an incorrect view of the relationship between social ideology and beauty. It seems that he divides social ideology into several small squares, occupied by "the idea of beauty," political ideas, religious ideas, philosophical ideas, etc. When people "judge" or "evaluate" whether things are beautiful or not, they measure them based on the "idea of beauty" in one of the small squares. In fact, ideology does not work so mechanically. Taking class consciousness as an example, the class consciousness of the general public does not necessarily have to contain "the idea of beauty" in order to react to beautiful things, but it determines everyone's attitude towards things, and thus determines whether everyone feels that things are beautiful or not. If he is an intellectual of the exploiting class in the old society, his ideology of wanting to enslave people determines that he feels the beauty of delicate, melancholy, and sickly women, and if he is a working person, his ideology of loving labor and healthy life determines that he feels the beauty of strong women. A person's ideology is an organic whole, and it works by making the organic whole work. If this organic whole also contains "the idea of beauty," this "idea of beauty" cannot function in isolation from the whole.

Lü Ying also shows confusion of thought on the issue of aesthetic feeling. He said, "Pleasing beauty, pleasing beautiful sounds, pleasing deliciousness... everyone feels a kind of pleasure (or aesthetic feeling). But... whether these shapes, colors, sounds and tastes are beautiful or not, and to what extent they are beautiful, and what is the meaning of this beauty, must be judged through consciousness;" "The recognition of beauty must go through the perceptual stage - aesthetic feeling, but feeling (aesthetic feeling) cannot be used to replace or even cancel rational understanding (concepts, ideas of beauty)." From this, several points can be seen: First, he regards "aesthetic feeling," "pleasure," and "feeling" as synonymous. Aesthetic feeling is indeed a feeling, a pleasure, but not all feelings or pleasures are aesthetic feelings. The task of aesthetics is to find out the characteristics of aesthetic feeling that are different from general feelings or pleasures. And Lü Ying's "aesthetic feeling" in the perceptual stage is actually just "pleasure," because since he has an aesthetic feeling for something, he must feel that that thing is beautiful, but Lü Ying says that the question of "whether it is beautiful or not" has to wait for the judgment of the rational stage. In this way, he canceled the true function of aesthetic feeling in the perceptual stage. Secondly, the so-called "aesthetic feeling judgment" is an old trick of Kant's. Many people have already argued in the past that this is a self-contradictory term. If it is aesthetic feeling, it is not judgment (this requires the use of concepts), and if it is judgment, it is no longer aesthetic feeling (this is direct and full of emotional factors). This is not to say that rational activity does not play a role in aesthetic feeling. Aesthetic feeling activity is a process of gradual deepening. In some cases, aesthetic feeling can stop at the perceptual stage, and in some cases, aesthetic feeling is the result of rational understanding. However, the viewer cannot stay at the rational understanding. He must feel a deeper level of aesthetic feeling on the basis of rational understanding. If this deeper level of aesthetic feeling does not occur, and the viewer is not emotionally moved more deeply, then his rational understanding is still only an activity in the scope of science, not an activity in the scope of art. Lü Ying's serious error is not only that he canceled aesthetic feeling in the perceptual stage and replaced it with pleasure, but also that he canceled aesthetic feeling in the rational stage and replaced it with "judgment." In this way, aesthetic feeling plays no role at all in his aesthetic viewpoint. Third, rational understanding is the final stage of the aesthetic process in Lü Ying's mind. After "rational understanding," he added parentheses to explain that it is "the concept and idea of beauty." From this, it can be seen that in Lü Ying's mind, "the idea of beauty" is not only beauty itself, but also the cause of beauty (the basis of judgment) and the result of beauty. This view of beauty starting with "idea" and ending with "idea," to put it mildly, is at least "intellectualist aesthetics" as described by idealist aesthetic historians.

Finally, talking about whether beauty is objective, subjective, or a unity of the objective and subjective, the self-contradiction of Lü Ying's thinking is still very prominent. He affirmed that beauty is a "secondary phenomenon," which I think is correct. I also see it this way. My reason is: art is a kind of social ideology, which reflects reality, so it is secondary. Beauty is an indispensable characteristic of art (it cannot be art without beauty), and it can only be secondary like the entity to which it belongs. But I have these two fundamental differences with Lü Ying: First, he regards beauty as an entity (ideology), equal to or juxtaposed with art. I do not recognize that beauty is an independent entity, and I affirm that it is an attribute of art (ideology), that is, ideological. Secondly, I believe that since beauty is secondary, it cannot simply be an inherent attribute of objective things in nature. Natural things can only have the conditions of beauty. The contradiction and unity of the objective conditions and the conditions of the subjective aspect of ideology can lead to art, and with art, there can be the unique beauty of art. In short, I deny the natural attribute theory of beauty. Lü Ying, on the one hand, admits the secondary nature of beauty, saying that "thoughtful materialists have never regarded beauty as an objective existence separate from people" (from this, we can know that he denies the objective existence of beauty), on the other hand, he also says that "beauty in reality is reflected in people's consciousness," "If there is no existence of beauty in real life, then there is no existence of beauty in the idea" (From this it is known that he affirms the objective existence of beauty). We may as well ask, is the "beauty in reality" that Lü Ying understands primary? Or secondary? If he says it is primary, he is self-contradictory, and it also raises a more serious question: primary and secondary, non-ideological and ideological, is a distinction in essence. Since beauty has both primary and secondary, how can these two essentially different "beauties" be unified? In other words, according to Lü Ying's self-contradictory view, the question of "what is beauty" has not yet been resolved. Secondly, if he says that "beauty in reality" is still secondary (he did not say so), then he admits that ideology has played a role in the image seen by the viewer when appreciating "beauty in reality." This is exactly my view of "natural beauty," that is, "natural beauty is embryonic artistic beauty," which is also the view of the unity of the subjective and the objective, and my view is what Lü Ying thinks "cannot explain beauty."

In short, Lü Ying's entire aesthetics only has these few sentences: "The idea of beauty" is beauty, which is the cause of beauty, and also the result of beauty. Beauty is also secondary, and it is not secondary. Aesthetic feeling is only pleasure, and aesthetic appreciation depends on rational judgment. How did Lü Ying get into such a self-contradictory dead end? I think the reason is very simple. His basic argument is only one: "Beauty is a kind of idea of people." The subjective idealist color of such a statement is too glaring, so he tried every means to cover it up. One method is to steal beams and replace pillars, using "social ideology" to decorate his so-called "idea." Another method is to sit on the fence. He also wants to cater to the popular mechanical materialist view, saying that beauty is still objectively existent. He forgot that in the same article he has repeatedly denied the objective existence of beauty. He also quoted Chernyshevsky's words to show self-importance. In fact, his point of view has nothing in common with Chernyshevsky's point of view, which anyone can see.

Incidentally, I will also answer Lü Ying's criticism of my theory of the unity of the objective and the subjective. He not only brought out "materialism," but also brought out "dualism" and "idealism" to prove that my view "cannot explain beauty." First, from the point of view of "materialism," he said that "this unity is consistency." I think this is distorting my original intention. I clearly said that this unity is the contradictory unity of two opposite sides, and never said that it is a simple consistency. The simple consistency of the objective and the subjective is the view of mechanical materialism. Dialectical materialism believes that this final consistency comes from the development process of contradictory unity. In the creation and appreciation of art, the objective conditions of beauty and the conditions of ideology and artistic cultivation on the subjective side are melted into an image, which is the process of this contradictory unity. Secondly, from the point of view of "dualism," Lü Ying said, "This means that the subjective and the objective are independent existences, canceling the objectivity of the subjective." Dualism is precisely the advocacy of the independent existence of the subjective and the objective. I emphasize the unity of the subjective and the objective. Why is this advocating the independent existence of the subjective and the objective? Why does this cancel the objectivity of the subjective? I don't understand this set of logic. Thirdly, from the point of view of "idealism," Lü Ying said, "This means that the subjective (absolute concept) is completely manifested in the objective (image), that is to say, beauty is an independent and free absolute idea." I think that the "idealism" he refers to seems to refer to Hegel. Hegel's understanding of beauty is the unity of the subjective and the objective, the unity of sensibility and rationality, but he believes that beauty must be the manifestation of the idea in a concrete image, and he never said that the absolute concept belongs to the subjective side, and he never said that beauty can be separated from a concrete image and become an "independent and free absolute idea." Moreover, my theory of the unity of the objective and the subjective is basically based on the Marxist theory of ideology, not on Hegel. Therefore, I think Lü Ying's three criticisms are somewhat "barking up the wrong tree."

    美就是美的观念吗？
    评吕荧先生的美学观点
    朱光潜
    吕荧先生在去年12月3日人民日报所发表的“美是什么”一文所表现的美学观点是混乱的，自相矛盾的。
    他的基本论点是：美就是“美的观念”，“美的概念”，“美的意识”，“审美观”，他还说，美也就是“社会意识”。很显然，他对于他所用的这一大堆抽象的名词，没有给以科学的明确的分析，因为这些名词在涵义上不能是完全相同的。
    首先说美是否就是“社会意识”。据我的了解，他所谓“社会意识”就是一般所谓“社会意识形态”。马克思、恩格斯告诉过我们，文学艺术是一种社会意识形态，美是否也是一种社会意识形态呢？吕荧说它也是，这就是把美看成一种实体，他忘记了“美”原来只是表明某种实体的一种属性，作为属性，美是不能脱离它所属的实体而独立存在的，更不能说它就是那实体本身。比如说，“一件艺术作品是美的”，这句话既不等于说，“美原来独立存在于这件艺术作品之外而后附加上去的，”更不等于说，“美就是这件艺术作品”。美既然是艺术的一种属性，而艺术本身既然是一种社会意识形态，美（属性）就不能同时是一种社会意识形态（实体），它只能是意识形态性的；这正如说“唯利是图是资产阶级的特性”，“资产阶级是一个剥削阶级”，我们从此不能得出结论说，“唯利是图就是剥削阶级”，只能说，“唯利是图是剥削阶级性的”。所以吕荧把美看作一种“社会意识”，就犯了一个显而易见的逻辑错误。在这个错误后面还隐藏着两个严重错误的美学观点。第一是他把“美”加以实体化，这也就是把“美”加以绝对化（美可以脱离它所属的实体而自成一种实体），这正是柏拉图式的客观唯心主义。其次，依吕荧的看法，美与艺术的关系只有两种可能，不是把“美”和“艺术”等同起来，就是把“美”和“艺术”并列起来，因为他否定了艺术与美的关系就是实体与属性的关系而肯定了二者同是实体。前一种正是克罗齐的看法（克罗齐认为艺术就是美”，后一种则近似托尔斯泰的看法（托尔斯泰否认美是艺术的特性）。无论是哪一种，错误都是很显然的。
    其次说“美的意识”。依一般的用法，这是指人对于美的意识，即有某物美而人意识到了。在这个意义上，美当然不能说就是“美的意识”，正如眼睛看花，眼睛所起的视觉不能就是花。吕荧所指的大概还是他所谓“社会意识”，社会意识不能就是美，上文已经说过，而且“意识”和“社会意识”也不能等同起来。用词的混淆一方面反映出思想的混乱，一方面也会导致思想的混乱。
    第三，“美的观念”也不能就是“美的概念”。“美的概念”是经过科学分析后对于美所下的定义。我们最近两年的美学讨论就足以证明我们还没有得到一个大家公认的明确的“美的概念”。但是我们并不因此就不能感到某些事物美，也并不因此就不能对美抱有某种看法，认为事物怎样才是美，怎样才是丑。而这种美的看法正是吕荧所说的“美的观念”或“审美观”。这种“美的观念”倒是社会意识形态总和中的一部分，也就是说，它是一定历史条件下的世界观和阶级意识决定的。吕荧模糊地认识到社会意识形态对于美的重要性，他的这一点好处我们是应该承认的。但是他在这方面的认识仍然是极端混乱的。第一，他没有看出作为全体的社会意识形态与作为其中一部分的“美的观念”之间的分别和关系。他时而说美是“美的观念”，时而说美是“社会意识”，好像二者可以等同，这样一来，部分就等于全体了。很显然，不是所有的社会意识形态都是美的，美学的任务就要找出美的社会意识形态所不同于其它社会意识形态的特点。吕荧对于“美的观念”和“社会意识”两词的任意互换使用就把这个问题掩藏起来了。其次，更重要的问题是：这种“美的观念”是否就等于“美”呢？说二者相等，就无异于说“花的观念”就等于“花”。谁也可以看出，这是彻头彻尾的主观唯心主义。尽管你承认“花的观念”由客观决定，这也不能挽救你，使你摆脱唯心主义，因为你毕竟肯定了意识（美的观念）就是存在（美），把观念代替了存在。依吕荧的逻辑，只要有“美的观念”就有“美”，我们大可睡在床上把眼睛闭起，让“美的观念”在脑里打转，于是艺术美，社会美，自然美等等“万美皆备于我”了。这倒是一个了不起的发明！
    但是吕荧的观点是太善变了，“美是人的一种观念”，话犹未了，接着就说美仿佛又不是人的一种观念。请听，“人在生活中见过许多花，关于花的美的概念已经形成，所以对于花的美与不美可以进行直接的判断”，“我们平常用美这个字，不仅仅用于评价山水花草等自然界的事物，……主要的是用于评价社会生活和社会事物。”从此可以看出他又把“美的观念”看作美的标准，即“判断”或“评价”事物美与不美的根据。然则“美”与“美的观念”又是两回事了，因为量布的尺不能就是所量的布。这里显然他是自相矛盾。
    再说美是否按照“美的观念”这个尺度量出来的呢？美是否就由“美的观念”产生出来的呢？我们并不否认“美的观念”可能影响美，但是这并非全面的客观事实。在很多的场合下，一个人发见一个女子美或是一个乐调美，心理过程是很直接的，不假思索的，并不拿她或它和自己的“美的观念”来比较一番。反之，也有许多人（特别是美学家们）头脑里装了一大堆事物怎样才能是美的陈词滥调，有很多的吕荧所谓“美的观念”，可是临到具体的美的艺术作品，却一窍不通，胡言乱道。这些现象却是吕荧所没有考虑到的。
    吕荧在这里也暴露出他对于社会意识形态对于美的关系抱着一种不正确的看法。他好像把社会意识形态分成若干小方格子，由“美的观念”，政治的观念，宗教的观念，哲学的观念等等分别占住，人在“判断”或“评价”事物美与不美时，就根据其中某一小方格里的“美的观念”来衡量。其实意识形态起作用，并不这样机械。姑举阶级意识为例来说，一般人民大众的阶级意识里并不一定要含有“美的观念”在内而后才能对美的事物起反应，但是它决定每个人对事物的态度，因而也就决定每个人感觉事物美或不美。是旧社会的剥削阶级的知识分子，他的要奴役人的意识形态就决定了他对于娇弱的多愁善病的女子起美感，是劳动的人民，他的爱劳动爱健康生活的意识形态就决定了他对于健壮的女子起美感。一个人的意识形态是一个有机整体，它起作用也是叫有机整体去起作用。假如这有机整体里也包含“美的观念”，这“美的观念”也不能离开整体而孤立地起作用。
    吕荧在美感的问题上也表现出思想的混乱。他说，“悦目的美色，悦耳的美音，悦口的美味……人人都感得一种快感（或美感）。但是……这些形色声味是美还是不美，以及美到什么程度，这种美的意义如何，就要通过意识的判断”；“美的认识必须经过感性阶段—美感，但是不能够用感觉（美感）代替乃至取消理性认识（美的概念、观念）”。从此可以看出几点：第一，他把“美感”，“快感”，“感觉”都看成同义字。美感固然是一种感觉，是一种快感，但是不是所有的感觉或快感都是美感，美学的任务就是要找出美感之所以不同于一般感觉或快感的特点。而吕荧的感性阶段的“美感”其实只是“快感”，因为对事物既然起了美感，当然就是感到那事物美，而吕荧却说“是美还是不美”的问题要待理性阶段的判断。这样他就取消了感性阶段的真正的美感作用。其次，所谓“美感判断”是康德的老玩艺，过去已经有许多人论证了这是个自相矛盾的名词，是美感就不是判断（这要运用概念），是判断，就已经不是美感（这是直接的，充满情感因素的）。这并非说，理性活动对于美感不起作用。美感活动是一种逐渐深化的过程。有些场合的美感可以止于感性阶段，也有些场合的美感是理性认识的结果。但是观赏者不能停留在理性的认识，他必须在理性认识的基础上感到深一层的美感；如果这深一层的美感不发生，观赏者在情感上没有受到更深的感动，那么，他的理性认识就还只是科学范围的活动而不是艺术范围的活动。吕荧的严重错误不仅在他在感性阶段取消了美感而代之以快感，而且在理性阶段里也取消了美感而代之以“判断”。这样一来，美感在他的美学观点中就根本不起作用了。第三，理性认识在吕荧的思想中是审美过程的终结阶段，在“理性认识”之后他加了括弧说明它就是“美的概念，观念”。从此可见，在吕荧的思想中“美的观念”不但就是美本身，而且又是美的原因（判断的根据），又是美的结果了。这个美以“观念”始，以“观念”终的看法，如果用比较温和的字样来说，至少也是唯心派美学史家所说的“理智主义的美学”。
    最后，谈到美是客观的，主观的，还是主客观统一这一个基本问题，吕荧的思想的自相矛盾仍然是很突出的。他肯定了美是“第二性的现象”，这一点我认为是正确的。我也是这样看，我的理由是：艺术是一种社会意识形态，是反映现实的，所以它是第二性的；美是艺术的一种必不可少的特性（没有美就不成其为艺术），它也只能像它所属的实体一样是第二性的。但是我与吕荧有这两点根本性的差别：第一，他把美看成一种实体（意识形态），和艺术相等或是并列，我不承认美是一种独立的实体，肯定它是艺术（意识形态）的一种属性，即意识形态性的。其次，我认为美既是第二性的，它就不能单纯地是自然界客观事物本有的一种属性，自然物只能有美的条件，这客观条件与主观方面意识形态的条件两对立面的矛盾统一之后才能有艺术，有了艺术才能有艺术所特有美，总之，我否定了美的自然物的属性说；吕荧一方面承认美的第二性，说“深思的唯物论者从来没有把美当做离开人的客观存在看待”（从此可知他否定了美的客观存在），一方面却又说，“现实中的美反映在人的意识中”，“在现实生活中没有美的存在，因而在观念中也没有美的存在”（从此可知他又肯定了美的客观存在）。我们不妨问一声，吕荧所了解的“现实中的美”是第一性的呢？还是第二性的呢？如果他说这是第一性的，他就是自相矛盾，而且还引起了一个更严重的问题：第一性与第二性，非意识形态性与意识形态性，这是一种本质上的分别，美既然有是第一性的，又有是第二性的，这两种本质不同的“美”如何统一起来呢？换句话说，依吕荧的自相矛盾的看法，“美是什么”这个问题就还没有得到解决。其次，如果他说“现实中的美”还是第二性的（他并没有这样说），那就是承认在欣赏“现实中的美”时意识形态对欣赏者所见到的形象已起了作用，这正是我对于“自然美”的看法，就是“自然美是雏形的艺术美”的看法，也就是主观与客观统一的看法，而我这个看法又是吕荧所认为“不能解释美”的。
    总之，吕荧的全部美学只有这样几句话：“美的观念”就是美，就是美的原因，也就是美的结果；美又是第二性的，又不是第二性的；美感只是快感，审美要靠理性判断。吕荧何以走到这样自相矛盾的死胡同里呢？我看原因很简单。他的基本论点只有一个：“美是人的一种观念”，这样的提法的主观唯心主义的色彩太刺眼了，于是他想尽方法来遮掩。一种方法是偷梁换柱，用“社会意识形态”来装饰他所谓“观念”，另一种方法是骑墙，他又要迎合流行的机械唯物主义的看法，说美仍然是客观存在的，他忘记了就在这同一篇文章中他已经一再否定了美的客观存在。他还援引车尔尼雪夫斯基的话以自重，其实他的观点与车尔尼雪夫斯基的观点毫无共同之处，谁也可以看得出。
    趁便也答复一下吕荧对我的客观与主观统一说的批评。他不但搬出“唯物论”来，还搬出什么“二元论”和“唯心论”来，证明我的看法“不能够解释美”。第一，从“唯物论”的观点，他说“这个统一就是一致”。我觉得这是歪曲我的原意，我明明说这个统一是两对立面的矛盾统一，从来没有说它是单纯的一致。主客观的单纯的一致是机械唯物论的看法，辩证唯物论却认为这最后的一致是经过矛盾统一的发展过程而来的，而在艺术的创作和欣赏中，客观的美的条件与主观方面意识形态和艺术修养等条件的熔铸成为形象，就是这种矛盾统一的过程。其次，从“二元论”的观点，吕荧说，“这就是说主观与客观是各自独立的存在，取消了主观的客观性”。二元论正是主张主客观各自独立的，我强调主客观的统一，为什么这就是主张主客观各自独立？为什么这就取消了主观的客观性？我不懂这套逻辑。第三，从“唯心论”的观点，吕荧说，“这就是说主观（绝对概念）在客观（形象）上的完全显现，也就是说美是独立自在的绝对观念。”我想他所指的这种“唯心论”像是指黑格尔，黑格尔所了解的美是主观与客观的统一，感性与理性的统一，但是他认为美必然是理念在具体形象里的显现，从来没有说绝对概念就属于主观方面，从来也没有说美可以离开具体形象而成为“独立自在的绝对观念”。而且我的主客观统一说基本上是根据马克思主义关于意识形态的理论，而不是根据黑格尔。因此，我认为吕荧的三点批评都有些“无的放矢”。
