Good News for Young Audiences: Two New Sets of Plays to be Staged

While rectifying its work style and continuing its work, the China Children's Theatre has prepared two new sets of plays. The first set includes the one-act plays "The Red Ball," "By the River," and the song and dance dramas "Picking Pine Cones" and "Magpie and Child." "The Red Ball" tells the story of a child who, influenced by his mother's bad habit of taking advantage of others, unconsciously steals a classmate's red ball, and later recognizes his mistake with the help of his sister and the principal. "By the River" reflects the Young Pioneers' bravery and resourcefulness in capturing special agents who attempted to sabotage the people's railway. "Picking Pine Cones" and "Magpie and Child" also reflect the children's courageous spirit and educate children to be honest.

This set of plays was performed exclusively for children at the Chongwen and Eastern Suburban District Workers' Clubs in early January and was warmly welcomed by the young audience. Recently, it will be performed for children at the Dongdan District, Dongsi District, Haidian District, Qianmen District, and Xidan District Workers' Clubs.

Another set of plays includes "Fighting Sunday," which reflects children's anti-rightist struggle, "A Pumpkin," which reflects the lives of children in rural areas today, and the fairy tale song and dance drama "Three Great Kings and Old North Wind." This set of plays will be performed for children at the China Youth Art Theatre in early February.

    小观众的好消息
    两组新戏将上演
    中国儿童剧院在整风、工作两不误的情况下，排出了两组新戏。第一组戏包括独幕话剧“红皮球”、“在河边上”和歌舞剧“采松塔”、“喜鹊与小孩”等。“红皮球”表现了一个孩子因为受了妈妈爱占便宜的坏思想影响，不自觉地偷了同学的红皮球，后来在姐姐和校长帮助之下认识了错误的故事。“在河边上”反映了少先队员英勇机智捉住了企图破坏人民铁路的特务分子。“采松塔”和“喜鹊与小孩”也反映了孩子们的勇敢精神，并且教育孩子要诚实做人。
    这组戏于1月初旬曾在北京市崇文、东郊区工人俱乐部专为儿童演出过，受到小观众热烈的欢迎。最近又将在东单区、东四区、海淀区、前门区、西单区工人俱乐部为孩子们演出。
    另外一组戏中有反映儿童反右斗争的“战斗的星期天”，有反映现在农村儿童生活的“一个南瓜”，还有童话歌舞剧“三大王和老北风”。这组戏将于2月初在中国青年艺术剧院剧场为孩子们演出。
