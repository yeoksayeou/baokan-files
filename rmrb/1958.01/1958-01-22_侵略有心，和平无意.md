　　Aggression in Mind, No Intention of Peace

　　Foreign dispatches report that several batches of American military engineers have followed U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor to Iraq, actively preparing to establish rocket bases. U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy also revealed in a secret testimony to the House Appropriations Committee that the establishment of missile bases in the Far East is being considered. However, the second letter from Eisenhower to Bulganin, published by the White House on the 21st, contained only a mere five lines and remained silent on Bulganin's suggestion to hold a summit meeting of the heads of various governments in two or three months to ease international tensions. These short messages have vividly outlined the true face of the American ruling group: aggression in mind, no intention of peace.

    侵略有心，和平无意
    外电传来，美国已经有几批军事工程师继美国陆军参谋长泰勒之后前往伊拉克，积极着手准备建立火箭基地。美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊在美国众院拨款委员会会议上秘密作证时又透露了正在考虑在远东建立导弹基地。而21日白宫公布的艾森豪威尔给布尔加宁的第二封复信，却只有寥寥五行，对于布尔加宁为缓和国际紧张局势，建议两三个月里举行各国政府首脑会议，却在装聋作哑，只字不提。几条短短的消息，已经活活地勾出了美国统治集团的本来面目：侵略有心，和平无意。
