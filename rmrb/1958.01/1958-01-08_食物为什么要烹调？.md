　　Why Cook Food?

　　Since our ancestors discovered fire, mankind has evolved from eating raw food to cooked food. Today, cooking has become a science, and it is also an art, reflecting our cultural life.

　　Why do we cook food?

　　The same food, due to different cooking methods, or due to different ingredients and seasonings added, makes the food have various different shapes and flavors. Well-prepared food, its color, aroma, and taste will bring people a very pleasant feeling, playing a role in increasing appetite, thereby enabling the human body to obtain a variety of nutrients.

　　Secondly, food undergoes a series of physical and chemical changes during the cooking process, increasing its digestibility. For example, vegetables after cooking, the cellulose they contain can be softened, and part of the hemicellulose becomes soluble. This change alters the hardness and structure of plant-based foods, thereby increasing digestibility.

　　Third, it can kill germs. Animal foods after slaughter and plant foods contaminated by soil fertilizers contain many pathogenic bacteria and parasite eggs. If they are not cooked or disinfected, they can bring diseases. For example, in some places, people have the habit of eating raw fish and raw clams, and the proportion of people suffering from parasitic diseases in these areas is very high. Large pieces of whole meat only reach a temperature of 60 to 70 degrees Celsius inside after boiling for one hour. In order to effectively kill germs in food, steamed stuffed foods must be thoroughly cooked before eating; meat chunks for boiling and stewing should not be cut too large; when stir-frying meat with high heat, try to stir evenly until the meat color changes and no longer has any traces of blood; when eating raw vegetables, rinse them with clean water first, and then put a small amount of vegetables in boiling water for 30 seconds to one minute and take them out (the water needs to be kept at the boiling point) to achieve the purpose of disinfection.

### 食物为什么要烹调？

专栏：为什么？

    食物为什么要烹调？
    自从我们的祖先发现了火，人类从生食进化到熟食。到今天，烹调已经成为一门科学，同时它又是一门艺术，反映了我们的文化生活。
    食物为什么要烹调呢？
    同一种食物，由于烹调的方法不同，或是由于所加的配料与调味品不同，就使得食物具有各种不同的外形和滋味。制备得很好的食品，它的色、香、味会带给人们非常愉快的感觉，起着增进食欲的作用，从而使人体获得多种营养素。
    其次，食物在烹调过程中，会引起一系列的物理和化学的变化，提高它的消化率。例如蔬菜经过烹调，所含的纤维素可以软化，一部分半纤维素变成可溶性状态。这种变化，改变了植物性食品的硬度和结构，从而提高了消化率。
    第三，可以杀灭病菌。屠宰后的动物性食品及被土壤肥料等污染过的植物性食品，都带有不少致病的细菌和寄生虫卵，如果不经过烹调或消毒处理，就能带来疾病。例如：有些地方，人们有吃生鱼、生蛤等习惯，这些地区的人患寄生虫病的比例很高。大块的整肉，煮沸一小时之后，肉内部的温度才达到摄氏六十到七十度。为了有效地杀灭食物中的病菌，蒸煮带馅的食品，必须熟透之后再吃；煮肉炖肉的肉块不要切得过大；用急火炒肉时，需尽量炒匀，直到肉色转变，不再带有血迹才行；蔬菜生食时，应先用清水冲净，然后将少量蔬菜放在正开的水中历三十秒到一分钟取出（水需保持沸点），以达到消毒的目的。　（杜寿玢）
