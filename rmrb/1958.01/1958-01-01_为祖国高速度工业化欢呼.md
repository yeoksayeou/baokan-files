    Yesterday, our country realized the great First Five-Year Plan; the 600 million Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, laid the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. This is a great leap forward in history.
    The construction of our country's socialist industrialization foundation has been achieved at the fastest speed. The result of five years of hard work is that the total output value of modern industry has increased by more than 132%, which is an extremely extraordinary figure. This figure means: the strength of the motherland has grown rapidly, like a ten-year-old child growing into a young adult; this figure means: the speed of industrial development in the past five years has surpassed that of the previous hundred years. This speed is
	Rarely Seen
    This speed is rarely seen in the history of world industry, and the track of this speed of development is the socialist system. This can be compared with another track of industrialization in the world – the capitalist system. The industrial growth rate of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries in 1957 has not yet been published, so let's calculate it based on the five years from 1952 to 1956! The United States increased by 19%, Britain by 16%, and France by 35.7%. Two "tracks," two speeds, China on the socialist system track took one hundred and thirty-two steps, while the fastest of the United States, Britain, and France on the capitalist system track could not even take thirty-six steps.
    In particular, the growth rate of our country's heavy industry should be written like a poet wrote: "Use the biggest font, like steel nails hammered into steel plates, write these numbers, no—these poems." Write the past five years of the motherland: steel, calculated in tons, jumped from 1.35 million to 5.24 million, with an average annual increase of 31.2%; coal, calculated in tons, jumped from 63.53 million to 122.44 million, with an average annual increase of 14%; electricity, calculated in kilowatt-hours, jumped from 7.26 billion to 19.003 billion, with an average annual increase of more than 21.4%;... The development of heavy industry far exceeded the speed stipulated in the plan.
    Let us also write down the numbers of the leading capitalist country—the United States—and the industrially developed Britain, Germany, Japan, and France, and see how long it took them in history to increase from the level of our country in 1952 to the level of 1957. First, let's write about the "uniquely endowed" United States: from 1880 to 1896, its steel increased from 1.27 million tons to 5.36 million tons, taking sixteen years; from 1880 to 1888, its coal increased from 64 million tons to more than 134 million tons, also taking three years longer than our country; from 1902 to 1912, its electricity increased from 6 billion kilowatt-hours to 24.8 billion kilowatt-hours, taking two full five-year periods. The old British Empire was even more "stable." From 1880 to 1903, its steel increased from 1.31 million tons to 5.11 million tons, taking twenty-three years; from 1855 to 1872, its coal increased from 62 million tons to 124 million tons, taking seventeen years; from 1923 to 1933, its electricity increased from 9.4 billion kilowatt-hours to 18.6 billion kilowatt-hours, taking a full ten years. Let's compare with the "rising star" Germany: from 1886 to 1897, its steel increased from 1.36 million tons to 5.09 million tons, taking a total of eleven years; from 1885 to 1905, its coal increased from 61 million tons to more than 132 million tons, taking twenty years; from 1913 to 1925, its electricity increased from 5.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 20.3 billion kilowatt-hours, taking twelve years. Japan..., France....
    It is not necessary to cite too many examples. These figures have already formed a vivid race walking chart of socialist industrialization speed surpassing capitalist industrialization speed.
    We are Proud, Proud of Our New System
    Today, the Second Five-Year Plan begins. According to the outline of the "Eighth National Congress" of the CPC on the Second Five-Year Plan, on the existing basis, the Second Five-Year Plan will increase steel to 12 million tons; coal to 210 million tons; electricity to 43 billion kilowatt-hours;... Many situations indicate that the industrial development of our country's Second Five-Year Plan, which is being compiled, will exceed these figures. Even based on these figures, the industrial development of our country continues to maintain a fast speed. This speed is too abstract to measure in percentages, so let's use the same situation in the industrial history of capitalist countries to measure it! It took the United States five years to increase steel from 5.36 million tons to more than 13 million tons (this is the unprecedented speed of the American steel industry in nearly a century); it took eleven years to increase its coal from more than 134 million tons to 229 million tons; it took five years to increase its electricity from 24.8 billion kilowatt-hours to 43.4 billion kilowatt-hours. It took Britain more than six five-year periods plus three years to increase steel from 5.11 million tons to more than 12 million tons; it took a full twenty-five years to increase its coal from 124 million tons to 200.2 million tons; it took two five-year periods plus three years to increase its electricity from 18.6 billion kilowatt-hours to more than 42.7 billion kilowatt-hours. It took Germany eleven years to increase steel from 5.09 million tons to 12.06 million tons; it took thirty-two years to increase its coal from more than 130 million tons to more than 210 million tons; it took eleven years to increase its electricity from 20.3 billion kilowatt-hours to 42.5 billion kilowatt-hours. Japan..., France....
    It is not necessary to cite too many examples. The comparison of these figures cannot but make the Chinese people proud, proud of the speed of the motherland's industrialization, and proud of the new system established by the Party leading the people.
  Two Upsurges are Coming Side by Side, We Cheer:
        Long Live! The Second Fast Five Years!
    The speed of our country's industrialization has brought some people's thoughts from nostalgia for the capitalist system to praise for the socialist system. Five years ago, some people in technology, "worshipped the United States, believed in Germany, admired Japan, doubted the Soviet Union, and looked down on China." This is not only the sense of inferiority left to people by history, not only the historical concept of the backwardness of old China's industry in the world, but also a big question mark hidden in this concept—is the socialist system better or the capitalist system better? Now, this gray concept and question mark have been overthrown and answered by the speed of our country's industrialization and by the help of the Soviet Union. It can be said that this is a revolution in the minds of some people caused by our country's socialist construction, especially the speed of our country's industrialization.
    Now, a new upsurge in agricultural production and a new upsurge in industrial production and construction are coming side by side. This is very different from the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. At that time, the borders of our country were resounding with the flames of the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea, we had a moldy capitalist system in our country, our hands did not have the skills to build industry, and our feet did not have the initial foundation for industrialization.... Today, we have many things that we did not have in the previous five years. The new situation, the people's wishes, the strength of the country,... many signs show that the industrial growth of the Second Five-Year Plan may exceed the currently projected speed.
    At the beginning of this Second Five-Year Plan, on the New Year's Day of the first year of catching up with Britain, looking back at the industrial growth rate of the previous five years and looking forward to the industrial growth rate of the next five years, comparing the industrial growth rate of capitalist countries, people can see: with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the socialist system, with the intelligent and hardworking 600 million people, with our rich and vast land, with the help of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, with all this that will never be lost, the construction of our country's industrialization can always maintain an extremely high speed. We proudly cheer for this: Long live—the speed of the motherland's industrialization.

### 为祖国高速度工业化欢呼

    为祖国高速度工业化欢呼
    新华社记者　李峰
    昨天，我国已实现了伟大的第一个五年计划；占地球人口四分之一的六亿中国人民，打下了社会主义工业化的初步基础。这是历史的大跃进。
    我国的社会主义工业化基础的建设，用的是最快的速度。五年艰苦劳动的结果，现代工业总产值增加了132％还多，这是个极不平凡的数字。这数字是说：祖国的力量有了飞速的增长，就像十岁的孩子长成了青壮年；这数字是说：近五年工业发展的速度胜过从前一百年。这速度在世界工业史上
      快得罕见
    这速度在世界工业史上快得罕见，这速度发展的轨道就是社会主义制度。这可以同世界上另一条工业化的轨道——资本主义制度作比较。1957年美、英、法等国的工业增长速度还没有发表，就按1952年到1956年这五年算吧！美国增长19％，英国增长16％，法国增长35.7％。两种“轨道”，两种速度，在社会主义制度这条轨道上的中国走一百三十二步，在资本主义制度轨道上的美、英、法，最快的也还走不到三十六步。
    特别是我国重工业的增长速度，应该像一位诗人所写的那样：“要用头号大字，像钢钉钉在钢板，写上这些数字，不——这些诗篇。”写上祖国前五年：钢，用吨算，从一百三十五万跳到了五百二十四万，平均每年增长31.2％；煤，用吨量，从六千三百五十三万跳到一亿二千二百四十四万，平均每年增长14％；电，以度算，从七十二亿六千万跳到一百九十亿零三千万，平均每年增长21.4％以上；……。重工业的发展，远远超过了计划规定的速度。
    我们且写下头号的资本主义国家——美国，写下工业发达的英国、德国、日本和法国的数字，看看他们历史上从我国1952年那样的水平提高到1957年的水平，用了多长时间。先写“得天独厚”的美国：1880年到1896年，它的钢，从一百二十七万吨提高到五百三十六万吨，用了十六年；1880年到1888年，它的煤，从六千四百万吨提高到一亿三千四百多万吨，用的时间也比我国多三年；1902年到1912年，它的电，从六十亿度提高到二百四十八亿度，用了两个整五年。老牌的大英帝国更“稳健”，1880年到1903年，它的钢，从一百三十一万吨提高到五百一十一万吨，用了二十三年；1855年到1872年，它的煤，从六千二百多万吨提高到一亿二千四百万吨，用了十七年；1923年到1933年，它的电，从九十四亿度提高到一百八十六亿度，用了整十年。我们再同“后起之秀”的德国比，1886年到1897年，它的钢，从一百三十六万吨提高到五百零九万吨，用的时间共十一年；1885年到1905年，它的煤，从六千一百多万吨提高到一亿三千二百多万吨，用的时间是二十年；1913年到1925年，它的电，从五十一亿度到二百零三亿度，用的时间是十二年。日本……，法国……。
    不必举例太多，这些数字，已经组成了一幅鲜明的社会主义工业化速度胜过资本主义工业化速度的竞走图。
    我们自豪，自豪我们的新制度
    今天第二个五年计划开始了。根据中共“八大”对第二个五年计划建议的轮廓，第二个五年计划在现有的基础上，钢，要提高到一千二百万吨；煤，要提高到两亿一千万吨；电，要提高到四百三十亿度；……。许多情况表明，我国正在编制的第二个五年计划工业的发展，将要超过这些数字。就按这些数字来说，我国工业的发展又继续保持了很快的速度。这速度之快，用百分数测量太抽象，还是用资本主义国家工业史上相同的情况来量吧！美国的钢，从五百三十六万吨增到一千三百多万吨，用的时间是五年（这是美国近百年炼钢工业空前绝后的速度）；它的煤，从一亿三千四百多万吨增到两亿二千九百万吨，用的时间是十一年；它的电，从二百四十八亿度增到四百三十四亿度，用的时间是五年。英国的钢，从五百一十一万吨增到一千二百多万吨，用的时间是六个五年还多三载；它的煤，从一亿二千四百万吨增到两亿零二百万吨，用的时间是二十五整年；它的电，从一百八十六亿度增到四百二十七亿多度，用的时间是两个五年还得加三年。德国的钢，从五百零九万吨增到一千二百零六万吨，用的时间是十一年；它的煤，从一亿三千多万吨增到两亿一千多万吨，用的时间是三十二年；它的电，从二百零三亿度增到四百二十五亿度，用的时间是十一年。日本……，法国……。
    不必举例太多，这些数字的对比，不能不使中国人民自豪，自豪祖国工业化的速度，自豪党领导人民建立的新制度。
  两个高潮正在并肩走来，我们欢呼：
        万岁！第二个快速的五年！
    我国工业化的速度，已经把一些人的思想，从恋念资本主义制度带到了赞美社会主义制度。五年前，有些人在技术上，“崇拜美国，迷信德国，佩服日本，怀疑苏联，看不起中国”。这不光是历史留给人的自卑感，这不光是旧中国工业在世界上落后的历史的概念，而且，这概念里还隐藏着一个大问号——社会主义制度好还是资本主义制度好。现在，这灰溜溜的概念和问号，已经被我国工业化的速度，被苏联的帮助，所推翻和回答。可以说，这是我国社会主义建设，特别是我国工业化的速度，在一些人的思想上引起的革命。
    现在，新的农业生产高潮，新的工业生产建设高潮，正在并肩走来。这同第一个五年计划的开端已大不相同。那时，我们国土的边沿响着美帝国主义侵朝战争的炮火，我们国内有发霉的资本主义制度，我们的双手没有建设工业的技能，我们的脚下没有工业化的初步基础……。今天，我们有了很多前五年所没有的东西。新的局势，人民的心愿，国家的力量，……很多迹象显示着第二个五年计划的工业增长，可能超越现在预计的速度。
    在这第二个五年计划的开端，在这提出追赶英国的第一年的元旦，回顾前五年的工业增长速度，展望今后五年的工业增长速度，比比资本主义国家工业增长的速度，人们就可以看出：有中国共产党的领导，有社会主义制度，有聪明勤劳的六亿人民，有我们丰富辽阔的国土，有苏联等社会主义国家的帮助，有这永远不会失去的一切，我国工业化的建设，就能永远保持极高的速度。我们为此自豪地欢呼：万岁——祖国工业化的速度。
