The South-Central Fourth Engineering Company
Chaotic Management, Enormous Waste

(Our dispatch) Recently, the employees of the South-Central Fourth Engineering Company launched a vigorous "big blooming, big contending" campaign, focusing on the problems existing in enterprise management.

During the "blooming and contending," the workers revealed many instances of waste. For example, in the Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Factory project undertaken by the company, the expansion holes in the sawtooth steel roof truss of the main factory building were not carefully reviewed during the drawing review process. As a result, rework was required due to the holes being too small, wasting more than 34,000 yuan and prolonging the construction period. Last spring, the company transported white lime from other places, which was placed in the open air and lost more than 10,000 jin due to wind and rain. Farmers near the company reflected: "Before the Fourth Company came, we only had yellow dust storms here; after they came, we have white dust storms."

The company's employees also vigorously exposed the company's wasteful practices in conjunction with the year-end inventory check. Preliminary statistics from materials revealed by the masses show that in the two years since the end of 1955, the loss and damage of tools and labor protection equipment alone amounted to 237,000 yuan. For example, workers revealed that the temporary water pipes used in the Machine School construction project last year have been buried in the ground to this day, even though the project has been completed for a long time. Due to the lax distribution system for tools and labor protection equipment, a steelworker once received nine raincoats.

Currently, the company is studying improvement methods and further mobilizing the masses to offer improvement suggestions on the problems that have been exposed.

### 中南第四工程公司  管理混乱浪费大

    中南第四工程公司
    管理混乱浪费大
    本报讯　最近，中南第四工程公司职工针对着企业管理方面存在的问题，展开了大鸣大放。
    职工群众在鸣放中揭发了许多浪费现象。如这个公司承建的郑州砂轮厂工程，在图纸会审时对主厂房锯齿形钢屋架扩孔未认真审查，结果因孔小返工，浪费三万四千多元，同时延长了工期。去年春季这个公司由外地运来的白灰，放在野外因风刮雨淋已经损失一万余斤。公司附近农民反映：“四公司未来之前，我们这里刮的是黄风，来了之后刮的是白风”。
    这个公司的职工还结合年终清产核资，大力揭发了公司的浪费现象。从群众揭发出来的材料初步统计，从1955年底以来的两年时间，仅工具、劳动保护用品丢失和损坏的，即达二十三万七千元。如工人揭发去年在机校施工的临时用水管，工程早已竣工，但水管到现在还埋在土里。由于工具、劳动保护用品的发放制度不严，一个钢筋工人曾领了九件雨衣。
    目前，这个公司正在研究改进办法，并进一步发动群众对已揭发出的问题提改进意见。
