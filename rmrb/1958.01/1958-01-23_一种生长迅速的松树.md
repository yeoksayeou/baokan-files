    A Fast-Growing Pine Tree
    A new species of pine tree that grows very quickly was recently discovered in South Carolina, USA. A twenty-year-old tree can grow to a height of 22 meters and a thickness of 38 to 40 centimeters, while ordinary pine trees need 35 to 40 years to grow to this height and thickness.
    This tree has aroused the interest of some paper manufacturing companies in the United States, and they are starting to cultivate this pine tree.

    一种生长迅速的松树
    美国南卡罗来纳州不久以前发现了一种生长很快的新种松树。一棵二十年的树就可以长到高二十二公尺，粗三十八到四十公分，而普通松树长到这么高和这么粗需要三十五年到四十年。
    这种树木已经引起了美国一些纸张制造公司的兴趣，它们正在着手培植这种松树。
