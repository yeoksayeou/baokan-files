    苏联出版“诗经”俄译本
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联科学院出版了中国著名文学遗产“诗经”的俄文译本，苏联出版这样完整的“诗经”译本还是第一次。“诗经”的译者是苏联著名汉学家什图金，他二十多年来一直从事“诗经”的翻译工作。什图金对中国诗歌有深刻的研究，他流畅地表达了原诗的风味和情调。译文都有严格的韵律。苏联著名汉学家费德林博士为这本书写了长达六十多页的题为“诗经”的跋，这是苏联汉学家研究“诗经”的一篇最详细的文章。
    最近在苏联出版的还有苏联汉学家们七年前开始编译的“中国诗选”，全部四卷，已经出版三卷。全部诗选包括中国优秀的古典和现代诗歌，其中唐代的诗约占一卷。即将出版的第四卷中有毛主席的十八首诗词。这部诗选是郭沫若和苏联汉学家费德林主编的，有十余人参加翻译工作。郭沫若为诗选写了短序。
