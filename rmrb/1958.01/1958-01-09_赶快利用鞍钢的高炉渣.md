    Hasten the Use of Anshan Iron and Steel's Blast Furnace Slag
    Anshan Iron and Steel produces approximately 3.3 million tons of blast furnace slag annually (the waste remaining after ore smelting into iron). This slag, after processing, can be used to make slag cement, soundproof and heat-insulating building materials, and to pave roads. Slag bricks that have been pressed are beautifully colored and have a compressive strength approximately twice that of ordinary red bricks, making them the best material for building foundations for multi-story buildings.
    However, in recent years, due to insufficient attention from our leadership regarding the use of blast furnace slag, currently only 20% of the slag is used to make slag cement, while the remaining 80% is discarded in slag disposal sites. Calculating at two yuan per ton of slag, Anshan Iron and Steel is throwing away 5.3 million yuan of wealth into the slag heaps each year. Moreover, because the slag is not being utilized, it is necessary to build a slag disposal site with a railway line five or six kilometers long. This slag disposal site requires seven or eight hundred sleepers each month and two hundred and seventy workers for maintenance. More seriously, the slag disposal site is expanding day by day, taking up more and more of the agricultural cooperative's cultivated land, and even blocking agricultural irrigation canals. If the slag disposal site is allowed to expand indefinitely, it will occupy even more cultivated land, causing dissatisfaction among the peasants.
    Therefore, I hope that the leadership can seriously consider this issue and quickly build cement plants and slag brick factories near Anshan to fully utilize the slag. This will not only save the expenses of the slag disposal site each year but also increase the country's wealth by more than 5 million yuan. Moreover, the increased grain production due to not occupying farmland is not even included in this calculation.

### 赶快利用鞍钢的高炉渣

    赶快利用鞍钢的高炉渣
    鞍钢每年约有三百三十万吨高炉渣（矿石冶炼成铁后所剩下的废物）。这种炉渣经过处理以后，可以做矿渣水泥，可以做隔音保温的建筑材料，可以铺设公路。经过压制的矿渣砖颜色美丽，耐压力约比一般红砖高二倍左右，是多层建筑物做墙基的最好材料。
    可是，这几年来，由于我们领导上对利用高炉渣的工作注意不够，目前仅有20％的炉渣被用来做矿渣水泥，其余80％都被抛弃在矿渣处理场里。每吨矿渣以二元计算，每年鞍钢将有五百三十万元的财富被扔到矿渣场去。而且由于矿渣没有被利用，还必须修建一个铺设有五、六公里长铁路的矿渣场，这个矿渣场每月需要消耗七、八百根枕木，还要二百七十个工人维护。更严重的是矿渣场一天天扩大，占用农业合作社的耕地也一天比一天增加，甚至堵塞了农业引水渠。如果让矿渣场无限制地扩大下去，则将占用更多的耕地，会引起农民的不满。
    因此，我希望领导上能很好地考虑这个问题，迅速在鞍山附近修建水泥厂和矿渣砖厂，把矿渣充分利用起来。这样，不仅每年可以节约矿渣场的费用，而且将给国家增加五百多万元的财富，由于不占用农田，增产的粮食还不计在内。
