    Hoping Dongfeng Will Turn Defeat into Victory
    Tian Xiying

    Dongfeng County in Jilin Province was one of the counties where grain production decreased during the first Five-Year Plan. After seeing the People's Daily editorial "Achieve Another Bumper Harvest, Leap Forward Again" and its criticism, the Dongfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately examined the reasons for the production decrease, proposed effective solutions, and resolved to overcome conservative thinking, stir up revolutionary vigor, strive to achieve the target of 400 jin per mu stipulated in the Agricultural Program ahead of schedule, and start reversing the trend of production reduction this year. This revolutionary spirit of catching up is worthy of applause and congratulations.

    Dongfeng has failed to complete its plan for the past five years, and now it has set such a high target. Can it be achieved? Can a region like Dongfeng with unfavorable objective conditions make a leap forward? It is undeniable that objective conditions have a certain impact on agricultural production, but they do not play a decisive role. The decisive role is played by human effort. Unfavorable factors can be transformed into favorable factors through human effort, and bad conditions can also be improved through effort. There are countless examples of this. Conversely, if subjective effort is abandoned, even with good factors and good conditions, their role cannot be fully utilized. The conditions in the Taihu Lake area of southern Jiangsu cannot be considered bad, but the annual grain increase rate in the past five years has been only 3.49%. It is evident that simply relying on natural conditions is not enough.

    There is also the question of attitude. Zhouzhi and Qingjian counties in Shaanxi Province have experienced annual production decreases since 1953. After being criticized at the recent commissioner and county head meeting, the cadres from these two counties adopted different attitudes towards the criticism. The comrades from Qingjian, like the Dongfeng County Committee, examined the reasons for the production decrease and resolved to catch up. This year, they will make a great leap forward and strive to become a surplus grain county. Ten years later, the grain yield per mu will be increased from the current forty-odd jin to four hundred jin. The comrades from Zhouzhi County, on the other hand, argued that the figures reported by the statistics department were inaccurate and that the provincial criticism was not consistent with the facts. When the participants asked them to talk more about the situation so that everyone could analyze it, they emphasized that they had only been in the county for a few years, were not familiar with the situation, and were unwilling to talk more. Such an attitude of not examining from the depths of one's thinking, but simply making excuses and sophistry, is certainly not the attitude of a revolutionary. With such an attitude, the enthusiasm for work can be imagined, and a leap forward would be very difficult.

    Qingjian and Dongfeng were defeated generals on the agricultural production front in the past five years; however, failure is the mother of success. As long as they can learn from their lessons, catch up quickly, and not be discouraged, they will certainly be able to turn defeat into victory after a period of effort.

    In addition to Dongfeng County, there are other counties and cities mentioned in the People's Daily editorial that reduced production during the first Five-Year Plan. There are also some counties and cities that were not mentioned in the editorial. What attitude do these counties and cities have towards this matter, and what are their views? We have not yet seen any reaction. People can't help but ask: Are these counties and cities working hard and striving to improve? Or are they drawing a line and resigning themselves to lagging behind?

    预祝东丰转败为胜
    田喜盈
    吉林省的东丰县，是第一个五年计划中粮食减产的县份之一。中共东丰县委看到人民日报“丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进”社论中的批评以后，立即检查减产原因，提出有效办法，决心克服保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，争取提前实现农业纲要规定的亩产四百斤的指标，并从今年起开始扭转减产局面。这种迎头赶上的革命精神是值得鼓掌称贺的。
    东丰过去五年一直没有完成计划，现在一下定了这样高的指标，能不能实现呢？像东丰这样客观条件不好的地区，能跃进吗？不可否认，客观条件对农业生产有着一定的影响，但不起决定作用，起决定作用的是人的努力。不利因素，经过人的努力可以变成有利因素，不好的条件，经过努力也可以变好。这样的例子是不胜枚举的。反之，如果放弃主观努力，虽有好的因素，好的条件，也不可能充分发挥它的作用。江苏南部太湖地区的条件不能算坏，但五年中粮食递增率只有3.49％。可见单纯依靠自然条件是不行的。
    这里还有态度问题。陕西省盩厔（读周至）、清涧两县，1953年以来，年年减产。最近在专员、县长会议上受到批评以后，这两县参加会议的干部对待批评采取了不同的态度。清涧的同志和东丰县委一样，检查减产原因，下决心迎头赶上，今年就要来个大跃进，争取变为余粮县，十年以后，粮食每亩产量要从现在的四十多斤提高到四百斤，盩厔县的同志则相反，他们推说统计部门报的数字不准，省里的批评不符合事实。当与会者要他们多谈一些情况让大家分析的时候，他们又强调到这个县没有几年，情况不熟悉，不愿多谈。像这样不从思想深处检查，一味推诿、强辩，当然不是革命者的态度。态度如此，工作的劲头也就可想而知，跃进当然很困难。
    清涧和东丰，过去五年在农业生产战线上做了败将；但是，失败是成功之母，只要他们能接受教训，急起直追，不灰心、不气馁，经过一个时期的努力，一定能转败为胜。
    在第一个五年计划期间降低产量的，除东丰县而外，人民日报社论中提到的，还有其他一定县市。社论中没有提到的，还有一些县市。这些县市对这件事究竟抱着什么态度，有些什么看法，到现在还未看到反应。人们不禁要问：这些县市是在埋头苦干，发愤图强呢？还是划地为牢、自甘落后呢？
