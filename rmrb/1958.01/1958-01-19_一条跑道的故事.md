The Story of a Running Track

    Before liberation, Beijing Women's No. 14 Middle School was a missionary school. Most of the students here were children of poor city residents. The school grounds were small, and the facilities were very basic. After liberation, the state built a new teaching building for them. However, the school was located between factories and many residential houses, and a large playground and a long-distance running track suitable for students' physical exercise could not be solved for a while.

    During the airing of views period of the rectification movement, nearly a thousand big-character posters were put up by all teachers and staff in the school, many of which demanded a solution to the problem of student sports venues. In particular, the sports group's demands were even more intense. With a complaining mood, they described the small sports venue as stacking arhats, developing towards the sky. They criticized the Municipal Education Bureau for shouting slogans about exercise, but what could they do if conditions were not provided! After entering the rectification phase, the teachers of the sports group, in light of the spirit of "running schools diligently and thriftily" taught by the Party, thought, is it right to only complain to the leaders and wait for the superiors to solve the problem? Could the factory stop production and move because of the school's sports field problem? With so many residential houses, where would people move to all at once? This was obviously not feasible. Then, have we taken the initiative to think of ways to overcome the difficulties ourselves? No. At this time, the teachers quickly came up with a plan: there was an alley next to the small playground on the west side of the school, more than one hundred meters long, which could be completely renovated as a running track for students to race on.

    After the sketch of the running track was handed over to the rectification team, it was immediately approved. After the news of the construction of the running track spread, the students jumped up happily and said, "Building sports venues for ourselves to exercise, how could we not be happy! This kind of hands-on labor is a very good exercise!"

    In this way, a running track was built without demolishing any residential houses or spending state funds.

    The sports group put up a big-character poster with a complaining tone on October 28th last year.
    The running track has been built. From now on, they will no longer just play stacking arhats. They can compete for the 100-meter champion. Look how fast they are running on the field they built with their own labor.
    The students are working hard and happily to clean up the alley.

    一条跑道的故事
    北京市女十四中解放前是一所教会中学。在这里念书的大部分都是贫苦市民子女。学校场地狭小，设备非常简陋；解放后国家给他们盖了新的教学大楼。但是，这所学校处在工厂和许多民房之间，大的操场和适合学生体育锻炼的长距离跑道，一时无法解决。
    在整风运动的鸣放时期，全校教职员共贴了近千张大字报，其中有许多是要求解决学生体育活动场地的，尤其是体育组的要求更为激烈，他们带着埋怨的情绪，形容体育场地狭小为叠罗汉，向高空发展。批评市教育局空喊锻炼，你不给条件怎么办！进入整改阶段后，还是体育组的教师们，对照党所教导“勤俭办学校”的精神，想到光埋怨领导，等待上级解决对吗？工厂能因学校的体育场问题就停止生产搬家吗？这样多的民房叫人家一下搬到那儿去呢？这显然是行不通的。那么我们自己主动想办法克服困难了没有呢？没有。这时，教师们动脑筋很快就想了一个方案：学校西边小操场旁有一条夹道，有一百多公尺长，完全可以修作学生们赛跑用的跑道。
    修跑道的草图交给整改小组后，立即获得了同意。修跑道的消息传出去后，同学们高兴的跳了起来说：“为我们自己锻炼身体修体育场地，那能不高兴呢！这种亲自动手的劳动，就是很好的锻炼呀！”
    就这样，一条既不拆毁民房，又不花费国家资金的跑道修成了。

    体育组在去年10月28日出了一张带有埋怨口吻的大字报。
    跑道修成了。从现在起，她们不再光玩叠罗汉了。她们可以争夺百公尺冠军。看她们在用自己的劳动修筑的场地上跑得多快活。
    学生们在紧张、愉快地做清理夹道的劳动。
