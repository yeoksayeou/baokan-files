    In Favor of Unified Geological Work
    Li Guanghe
    Comrade Wang Hanfu's article "Geological Work Needs Unification" (see page 3 of this newspaper on January 4th) is an important suggestion for improving the current geological system. In addition to completely agreeing, I would like to offer some supplementary opinions based on my experience working in the geological department for several years. These are for those studying this issue to consider.
    (1)
    Since the founding of the People’s Republic, geological work has been led separately by various departments of the Central Government, with each responsible for exploring the mineral resources needed for national industrial and agricultural construction. The proven reserves of urgently needed minerals have been able to guarantee national needs, fully leveraging the initiative of various departments. This proves that the past policy of multiple development and simultaneous progress was correct and adapted to the objective historical circumstances at the time. At the same time, it created a material basis for the current unification of geological work.
    However, judging from the current situation: on the one hand, the geological exploration force has greatly increased, and the originally urgently needed major minerals are basically guaranteed; on the other hand, new urgently needed minerals—such as chromium, nickel, other rare metals, and certain non-metallic minerals—urgently need to be found; the issue of regional balance also urgently needs to be resolved. At the same time, in order to implement the central government's policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, geological work must be unified.
    (2)
    What are the benefits of unifying geological work? To summarize, the main ones are roughly as follows:
    First, it can strengthen the overall planning of national underground resource exploration, and can comprehensively consider and fully guarantee the mineral resources needed for national and local enterprises, foreign trade, and the issue of regional balance. Such overall consideration and long-term planning are difficult to achieve under a decentralized system.
    Second, it can rationally use geological exploration forces and exploration funds, avoid duplication and waste, offset forces, and affect geological exploration results. At present, there are many overlaps in institutions and duplication of work in geological work departments. In order to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities, various departments compete for mineral locations and keep secrets from each other; areas that have been rejected by Department A are then worked on by Department B; or two units are conducting roughly the same work in the same area; or they are looking for different mineral resources in the same area; some even dig trenches and drill wells to grab mineral locations, conducting layer-by-layer encirclements or even using artillery bombardment (using explosives for blasting in mountainous areas), wasting a lot of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and time, which is not in line with the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. The unification of geological work organization is the fundamental solution to these problems.
    Third, it can further strengthen the leadership of local Party and government organs over geological work. At present, there are more than fifty provincial-level geological institutions in the country, and many provinces have four to seven parallel geological bureaus (departments) and their affiliated geological teams. There are many overlapping institutions and leaders. Everyone asks the local Party and government leading organs for leadership and support. However, often no unit can grasp comprehensive geological data and report to the local Party and government leading organs in a unified manner. This not only increases the difficulty for the local Party and government leading organs to lead and supervise geological work, but also fails to play its due role in local planning for industrial and agricultural construction. After the unification of geological work organization and leadership, there will be a general leader in each province, which will facilitate the leadership of the local Party and government leading organs, concentrate forces, and obtain fruitful geological exploration results.
    (3)
    How can we achieve the unification of geological work and embody the benefits of unification?
    There are two views on how to achieve unified geological work: one view is: the center is unified, the blocks are unified, but the departments are not unified. That is to say: at the central level, the Party Central Committee and the State Council—the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission—carry out unification (various departments are still decentralized); at the local level, the provincial Party committees and people's committees adopt methods of dividing territories, delimiting boundaries, and handling registration to avoid phenomena such as competing for mineral locations and duplicate work causing waste. This approach can relatively solve problems in certain areas and during certain periods. However, this approach is a palliative measure and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. The other view is: unify everything from top to bottom, left to right, department to department, block to block. That is, unify the geological work currently scattered in various departments under the Ministry of Geology, and let the Ministry of Geology conduct comprehensive geological research on the entire national territory, conduct general surveys and explorations of all mineral resources. Only in this way can the problem be completely solved.
    After the geological work of various departments is unified under the Ministry of Geology, a geological bureau should be established in each province (autonomous region) across the country (which has basically been set up), under the dual leadership of the Ministry of Geology and the province. The provincial geological bureau can determine areas based on geological structure and national needs, combined with transportation conditions, and establish regional comprehensive geological brigades. In areas with good geological conditions, two or three comprehensive geological brigades can be set up within a special district. Each brigade should work in the designated area for a long time. In addition to conducting general surveys and explorations of known promising mineral locations, a comprehensive geological team should be established in counties with good mineralization conditions, and gradually expanded to every county, responsible for general mineral prospecting and exploration, scientific research, providing geological technical guidance to local enterprises, and mobilizing the masses to report mineral deposits.
    Since the regional comprehensive geological brigade works in a certain area for a relatively long period of time—five years, eight years, or even ten years, twenty years...—it can set up full-time personnel and specialized equipment to study the geological structure and mineral conditions of the region, and gradually prepare comprehensive long-term plans in order to carry out planned general surveys, explorations, and regional geological surveys. At the same time, since the brigade basically has an established structure and is relatively fixed, it can save the state a lot of organization, cancellation, or transfer costs. Since comprehensive mineral prospecting is carried out by region, it can not only give full play to the role of geological technicians, especially senior geological technicians, but also enable all geological technicians to be trained in actual work, rapidly improve their technical level, cultivate regional experts, and find promising mineral locations as soon as possible. At the same time, since the brigade organizes construction faster, dispatches more flexibly, and analyzes and appraises more quickly (because there is a chemical analysis station) than when the provincial bureau directly leads production, the geological data and analysis and appraisal results are also obtained more quickly, and the evaluation of geological conditions is also faster. In this way, it is possible to explore more and better mineral resources quickly and economically, and to obtain geological results year by year; and it is also possible to gradually understand the distribution and reserve status of all mineral resources in the motherland within a certain number of years. It can not only balance the issue of regional distribution, but also comprehensively guarantee the mineral resources needed for large enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and foreign trade.
    (4)
    What are the ideological reactions to the unification of geological work at present? There are roughly two types. One is the demand for unification; the other is attachment to decentralization.
    The idea of ​​demanding unification is manifested in many ways. During the great contending and blooming stage of the rectification, the vast number of employees of the geological departments and related organs of various ministries of the Central Government across the country demanded that unification be realized as soon as possible to avoid duplication of work and waste, which would affect geological results. The vast number of employees who merged from the geological departments of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry into the Ministry of Geology warmly welcomed the merger and supported unification. Local Party and government organs and farmers believed that there were too many leaders and too much confusion in the past, and they also supported unification.
    The main reason for clinging to the idea of decentralization is: worry that mineral resources will not be guaranteed after the geological institutions are merged into the Ministry of Geology. This idea essentially does not believe in science and collective power. As everyone knows: the Ministry of Geology is a professional ministry specializing in geological work. The leadership is strong, there are many experts, and the geological technical force and scientific research force are relatively strong. And the geological technology and scientific research forces of units such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Coal Industry are not weak, and they also have some good experience in enterprise management. Then, after the unification of geological work, it will be even better to learn from each other's strengths, draw on collective wisdom, learn from each other, and improve together, which can only increase strength and will not weaken strength. Therefore, the worry that mineral resources will not be guaranteed after the merger is unnecessary. Comrade Wang Hanfu said it well: "Can it be that the tasks that the geological forces scattered in various departments can complete, the powerful unified collective force gathered together cannot complete?"
    Judging from the above situation, the unification of geological work not only has a material foundation, but also has an ideological foundation and a mass foundation. It is not only necessary, but also possible. The unification of geological work organization is an important measure for the geological work to implement the construction policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. When the first five-year plan is successfully completed and the second five-year plan has just begun, in the high tide of rectification in this rectification movement, it is time to summarize past experience and study how to improve future work. I firmly believe that the responsible comrades of the relevant units will definitely consider the opinions of all parties and take revolutionary measures to achieve the unification of geological work at an early date.

    赞成统一地质工作
    李光和
    王含馥同志的“地质工作需要统一”一文（见1月4日本报第三版），是对改进当前地质事业体制的一项重要建议。我除了完全同意外，并根据在地质部门工作几年来的体验，提出一些补充意见。供研究这一问题者参考。
    （一）
    建国以来，地质工作由中央各部分别领导，分工负责勘探国家工农业建设所需要的矿产资源，探明的国家急需矿产的储量，能够保证国家的需要，充分发挥了各部的积极性。这证明过去采取多方发展、齐头并进的方针是正确的，是适应当时客观历史情况的。同时给现在统一地质工作创造了物质基础。
    但是，从目前的情况看来：一方面，地质勘探力量有了很大的增长，原来急需的主要矿产基本上有了保证；另一方面，新的急需矿产——铬、镍等稀有金属和某些非金属等，急需大力寻找；地区平衡问题也急需要解决，同时为了贯彻中央关于大中小型企业相结合的方针，地质工作都必须要统一。
    （二）
    统一地质工作究竟有那些好处呢？归纳起来，主要的大体有以下几点：
    第一、能够加强对全国地下资源勘察的全面规划，对国家和地方企业及对外贸易所需的矿产资源，以及地区平衡问题，可以统筹兼顾和全面保证。这种通盘考虑，长期规划，在分散的情况下，是很难实现的。
    第二、能够合理使用地质勘探力量和勘察资金，避免重复浪费、抵消力量、影响地质勘探成果。目前地质工作部门的机构重叠、工作重复很多。各部门为了完成上级机关交给的任务，互抢矿点，互相保密；甲作过已经否定的地区，乙又去作；或者是两个单位同在一个地区进行大体相同的工作；或者是同在一个地区而分别找不同的矿产资源；甚至有的为抢矿点以挖槽、井探，互相进行层层围攻甚或要用炮轰（山地工作用炸药爆破），不知浪费了多少人力、物力、财力和时间，是不符合多快好省的建设方针的。而地质工作组织上的统一，是解决这些问题的根本办法。
    第三、能够进一步加强地方党政机关对地质工作的领导。目前全国有省一级的地质机构五十多个，不少省份有四个到七个的平行的地质局（处）及其所属地质队。机构重复，头领很多。大家都要求地方党政领导机关领导和支援。但往往没有一个单位能够掌握全面的地质资料，统一向地方党政领导机关报告。这不但增加了当地党政领导机关对地质工作领导和监督的困难；同时对地方规划工农业建设不能起到应起的作用。地质工作组织领导统一以后，一个省将有一个总的领导，这就便于当地党政领导机关进行领导，能够集中力量，获得丰硕的地质勘探的成果。
    （三）
    怎样才能实现地质工作的统一和体现统一的好处呢？
    对怎样实现统一地质工作有两种主张：一种意见是：中央统、块块统，条条不统。就是说：在中央，由党中央和国务院——国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会进行统一（各部仍然分散）；在地方，由省委和省人委采取分地盘、划界限和办理登记的方法，来避免争夺矿点重复工作造成浪费等现象。这种作法，在一定地区和一定时期内是能够相对的解决问题的。但是，这种作法，是一种治标的方法，因而不能彻底解决问题。另一种意见是：上下左右条条块块都统一，就是把目前分散在各部的地质工作，统一于地质部，由地质部对全国领土进行全面的综合的地质研究，对全部矿产进行普查和勘探，只有这样，才能彻底解决问题。
    各部的地质工作统一在地质部以后，应该在全国各省（自治区）设立一个地质局（目前基本上已设齐），受地质部和省的双重领导。省地质局可根据地质构造和国家需要，结合交通条件，基本上按专区范围划定区域，设立区域性综合地质大队。地质情况良好的地区，一个专署内可设置两三个综合地质大队。每个大队基本上在划定的区域内长期进行工作，除对已知的有希望的矿点进行普查与勘探外，应该在成矿条件好的县份设立一个综合地质队，并逐步扩展到每一个县都设一个综合地质队，负责普查找矿和勘探、科学研究、对地方企业进行地质技术指导和发动群众报矿等工作。
    由于区域性综合地质大队在一定区域内工作的期间较久——五年、八年甚至十年、二十年……，就可以设置专职人员和专门设备，着手研究本区域内地质构造和矿产状况，逐步编制全面的长远规划，以便有计划地开展普查、勘探和区域地质测量工作。同时由于大队基本上有了建制和比较固定，就能为国家节约不少组成、撤销或转移费用。由于按区域进行综合找矿，既能充分发挥地质技术人员特别是高级地质技术人员的作用，同时又能够使所有地质技术人员在实际工作中得到锻炼，迅速的提高技术水平，能够培养地区专家和尽快的找到有希望的矿产地。同时由于大队比在省局直接领导生产的情况下，组织施工快，调度灵活，化验分析及时（因设有化验站），从而获得地质资料和分析鉴定结果也就及时，对地质情况的评价也就更快。这样，既能够又快又省地探明又多又好的矿产资源，逐年获得地质的成果；又可在一定年限里逐步摸清祖国全部矿产资源的分布与储量状况。既能够对地区分布问题作到平衡，又能对大型企业和中小型企业以及对外贸易所需的矿产资源，统筹兼顾，全面保证。
    （四）
    目前，对统一地质工作有那些思想反应呢？大体上有二种。一种是要求统一；一种是留恋分散。
    要求统一的思想表现是多方面的。在整改阶段的大鸣大放中，全国各地属于中央各部的地质部门和有关机关的广大职工，要求尽快的实现统一，避免工作重复浪费，影响地质成果。从化学工业部和建筑材料工业部的地质部门合并到地质部来的广大职工，都热烈欢迎合并，拥护统一。地方党政机关和农民认为过去头多太乱，也都拥护统一。
    而留恋分散的思想主要是：担心将地质机构合并到地质部以后，矿产资源没有保证。这种思想，实质上是不相信科学和集体力量。大家知道：地质部是专门从事地质工作的专业部。领导强，专家多，地质技术力量和科学研究工作的力量比较强大。而冶金工业部和煤炭工业部等单位的地质技术和科学研究力量也不弱，同时在企业管理方面还有些好经验。那末，地质工作统一以后，就更能取长补短，集思广益，互相学习，共同提高，只能增加力量，不会削弱力量。因此，那种怕合并后矿产资源没有保证的担心，是不必要的。王含馥同志说得好：“难道分散在各部的地质力量能够完成的任务，集中起来的强大的统一的集体力量反而完不成吗？”
    从上面的情况看来，统一地质工作既有了物质基础，也有了思想基础和群众基础，不仅有必要，而且有可能。地质工作组织上的统一，是地质工作贯彻又多又快又好又省的建设方针的重要措施。当这第一个五年计划胜利完成，第二个五年计划刚刚开始的时候，在这整风运动的整改高潮中，正是总结过去经验，研究改进今后工作的时候，我很相信：各有关单位的负责同志，一定会考虑各方面的意见，采取革命措施，早日实现地质工作的统一。
