Editorial:
    To further rationally resolve the many new problems that have arisen in national construction land requisition work after agricultural cooperation, the State Council has revised the "Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction" issued in December 1953, and it has been re-promulgated with the approval of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. This is an important measure taken by our state organs in this rectification movement to revise and supplement some outdated laws and regulations in a timely manner.
    The revised and promulgated "Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction" adapts to the new situation in which the private ownership of the means of production has been fundamentally changed. Appropriate revisions have been made to the original measures regarding the procedures for land requisition, land compensation, and the resettlement of those whose land has been requisitioned. More importantly, it further emphasizes the principle that attention must be paid to economizing on land for national construction and makes specific revisions and supplements to several provisions.
    Our Party and government have always proceeded from the principle of combining the interests of the state with the interests of the masses in national construction land requisition, and have strictly required economizing on land use on the basis of ensuring the requisition of necessary land for national construction. According to the results of inspections, most of the large amount of land requisitioned over the years for socialist construction has been reasonable. However, it must be pointed out that the phenomenon of wasting land, such as excessive requisition and underutilization, early requisition and delayed use, and requisition without use, is still quite serious in some areas and among some land-using units. For example, recently, in order to further economize on land use, Beijing inspected the land use of thirty-three units. These units requisitioned a total of 10,800 mu of land. If the number of floors of the original design remained unchanged, simply increasing the building density to the general standard of about 25% would save approximately 4,000 to 5,000 mu of cultivated land, save approximately 500,000 yuan in state land requisition funds, and increase grain production by approximately 1 million jin per year using this land. Xuzhou recently inspected fourteen land-using units, of which seven units requisitioned a total of more than 2,100 mu of land, and more than 700 mu were surplus. The Chongqing Railway Administration requisitioned land in the city in 1951, and some of it was requisitioned but not used, and has been barren for six years. All these serious phenomena of land waste have aroused dissatisfaction among the local masses. From the above examples, it can be seen that the phenomenon of wasting land and harming the interests of the masses deserves serious attention.
    Why have our Party and government repeatedly emphasized economizing on land use in land requisition, and why has the phenomenon of wasting land not been completely overcome to this day? The reason for this is, of course, that some land waste is caused by insufficient experience and poor planning in the context of the rapid development of large-scale socialist construction; but the main reason is that many construction units do not have a sufficient understanding of the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and its implementation is not vigorous. They blindly pursue the so-called "socialist standards" in form, unilaterally demanding "large," "new," and "high"; their approach to land requisition is similar to the incorrect thinking of some people in financial budgeting who hold the so-called "wide calculation and narrow use." They only care about their own convenience, disregard the interests of the masses, and only calculate the small accounts of their own units, not the big accounts of the state. Therefore, they turn a deaf ear to the central government's instructions on economizing on land use and preventing waste, and turn a blind eye to the land they are currently wasting. They also do not understand that we are a country with a large population and little cultivated land. If we do not pay attention to economizing on agricultural land as much as possible under the principle of ensuring the necessary land for national basic construction, it will inevitably harm socialist construction and the vital interests of the broad masses of people. In addition, some local party and government organs and the superior organs of land-using units lack regular supervision and inspection of this work, and even treat the excessive demands and erroneous practices of some land-using units with a bureaucratic attitude, and fail to adhere to principles to carry out the struggle, which also makes it impossible to effectively and thoroughly overcome the phenomenon of wasting land. All localities must pay serious attention to these situations, and must combine the problems in this regard with the ongoing rectification movement, and conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection in accordance with the now promulgated Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction, and thoroughly correct them.
    Another key issue in land requisition work is to resolutely implement the mass line. We are a socialist country, and the state's requisition of land for construction is completely in line with the interests of the broad masses of people; whether land requisition is in line with the principle of both ensuring the needs of national construction and strictly economizing on land use is a matter of great concern to the broad masses of people. Past experience has proved that as long as we explain things clearly to the masses when requisitioning land, we will inevitably gain their consent and support; as long as we humbly solicit the opinions of the masses in land requisition work, the masses will inevitably put forward reasonable suggestions on the selection of land and on compensation and resettlement, help us make correct decisions, and smoothly implement them. As a result of doing so, both national construction and the production and life of the masses are taken care of, and both the land-using units and the masses are satisfied. Conversely, if, when requisitioning land, we neither solicit the opinions of the masses in advance, nor fully carry out mobilization and persuasion afterwards, and even, like some construction units or government organs, announce the start of construction quickly without carrying out mass work once a decision is made to requisition land, the result will either be land waste or will cause dissatisfaction among the masses, thereby hindering the smooth progress of national construction. From this, it can be seen that while paying attention to economizing on land use, we must pay attention to the mass line in land requisition work, and must conscientiously handle affairs in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction. This is an important link in doing a good job in land requisition work.
    Of course, when implementing the Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction, we must also pay attention to educating the masses to actively support national construction. Over the past few years, the smooth progress of national construction land requisition work has been inseparable from the continuous improvement of the political awareness of the broad masses and their active support. However, in some places, due to insufficient socialist education for the masses, some masses do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between individual interests and national interests, and current interests and long-term interests. Therefore, when the state requisitions land, they often make excessive demands on issues such as land compensation and living arrangements. To this end, party and government organs at all levels must adhere to the mass line and strengthen mass work in land requisition work, so that the masses can recognize the important significance of the state's requisition of land for construction, and thereby consciously and actively support socialist construction.
    In short, in the future national construction land requisition work, we must strictly abide by this regulation newly issued by the State Council, further pay attention to economizing on land use, do a good job in mass work, and both meet the land needs of the state for carrying out socialist construction and take care of the vital interests of farmers.

### 必须注意节约国家建设用地

    必须注意节约国家建设用地
    为了进一步合理地解决农业合作化以后在国家建设征用土地工作中所发生的许多新的问题，国务院把1953年12月发布的“国家建设征用土地办法”作了修改，经全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准，现在重新公布了。这是我们国家机关在这次整风运动中，对一些现已不合时宜的法律规章及时进行修改、补充的一个重要措施。
    这次修正公布的“国家建设征用土地办法”，适应着目前生产资料私人所有制已经根本改变的新情况，对原办法有关征用土地的程序、土地的补偿和对被征用土地者的安置等规定，都作了适当的修改；但更重要的是它进一步强调了国家建设用地必须注意节约这一原则，并且在若干规定上作了具体的修改和补充。
    我们党和政府对国家建设征用土地，一向是从国家利益与群众利益相结合的原则出发的，是在保证为国家建设征用必需土地的基础上严格要求节约用地的。根据检查的结果，历年来因进行社会主义建设而征用的大量土地，大部分是合理的。但是，必须指出，某些地区和某些用地单位多征少用、早征迟用和征而不用等浪费土地的现象，还是相当严重。例如，最近北京市为了进一步节约用地，检查了三十三个单位的用地情况，这些单位共计征用土地一万零八百亩，如果照原设计房屋的层数不变，只要把建筑密度提高到一般的标准，即25％左右，就可以少占四、五千亩左右的耕地，可以节约国家征用土地的资金约五十万元，利用这些土地每年可以增产粮食约一百万斤。徐州市最近检查十四个用地单位，其中七个单位共征用土地二千一百多亩，而多余的就有七百多亩。重庆铁路管理局1951年在该市征用的土地，有一部分征而未用，一直荒芜了六年之久。所有这些浪费土地的严重现象，都引起了当地群众的不满。从以上的事例中可以看到，浪费土地、损害群众利益的现象是值得严重注意的。
    为什么我们党和政府在征用土地上一再强调节约用地，而浪费土地的现象到现在还没有彻底克服呢？究其原因，固然有些土地的浪费是在大规模的社会主义建设迅速发展的情况下，由于经验不足和计划不周所造成的；但主要原因，则是由于不少建设单位对勤俭建国的方针，认识不足，贯彻不力。他们盲目地追求形式上的所谓“社会主义标准”，片面地要求“大”、“新”、“高”；对土地的征用，也如同有些人在财政预算上持有那种所谓“宽打窄用”的不正确思想那样，只贪图自己方便，不照顾群众利益，只算本单位的小账，不算国家的大账，因而对中央节约用地、防止浪费的指示，置若罔闻，而对自己眼前浪费着的土地，熟视无睹。他们还不了解，我们是一个人口多而耕地少的国家，如果不注意在保证国家基本建设必需用地的原则下尽量节约农业用地，就必然损害社会主义的建设和广大人民的切身利益。此外，有些地方党政机关和用地单位的上级机关，对这方面的工作缺乏经常的监督和检查，甚至以官僚主义态度对待有些用地单位的过分要求和错误作法，而不坚持原则进行斗争，也致使浪费土地的现象不能有效地彻底克服。各地对这些情况，必须予以严重注意，必须把这方面的问题结合正在进行的整风运动，根据现在公布的国家建设征用土地办法，全面地深入地进行一次检查，彻底加以纠正。
    征用土地工作中的另一个关键问题，是坚决贯彻群众路线。我们是社会主义国家，国家因建设而征用土地，同广大人民群众的利益是完全一致的；土地征用是否合乎既保证国家建设需要，又严格节约用地的原则，这是广大人民群众十分关心的。过去的经验证明，我们在征用土地的时候，只要向群众解释清楚，就必然会取得群众的同意和支持；只要我们在征用土地的工作中，虚心地征求群众意见，群众就必然会在选择用地以及补偿和安置等方面，提出合理的建议，帮助我们作出正确的决定，并顺利地贯彻执行。这样作的结果，对国家建设和群众的生产、生活都得到了照顾，用地单位和群众都满意。反之，如果在征用土地的时候，既不预先征求群众意见，事后也不充分进行动员说服，甚至如像有的建设单位或政府机关那样，一经决定征用土地，没有进行群众工作，很快就宣布动工，其结果不是造成土地浪费，就是招致群众不满，因而妨碍国家建设的顺利进行。由此可知，在注意节约用地的同时，必须注意征用土地工作中的群众路线，必须认真地按照国家建设征用土地办法中所规定的程序办事。这是做好征用土地工作的一个重要环节。
    当然，我们在贯彻执行国家建设征用土地办法的时候，也还必须注意教育群众积极支援国家建设。几年来，国家建设征用土地工作能够顺利进行，是同广大群众的政治觉悟不断提高和他们的积极支持分不开的。但是，有的地方，由于对群众进行社会主义教育不够，有些群众对于个人利益和国家利益、目前利益和长远利益的关系，还没有正确的认识，因而在国家征用土地的时候，对于土地补偿和生活安置等问题，往往要求过高。为此，各级党政机关在征用土地的工作中，必须坚持群众路线，加强群众工作，使群众认识到国家因建设而征用土地的重要意义，从而自觉地积极支援社会主义建设。
    总之，在今后国家建设征用土地的工作中，必须严格遵守国务院新发布的这个法规，进一步注意节约用地，做好群众工作，既要满足国家进行社会主义建设的用地需要，又要照顾农民的切身利益。
