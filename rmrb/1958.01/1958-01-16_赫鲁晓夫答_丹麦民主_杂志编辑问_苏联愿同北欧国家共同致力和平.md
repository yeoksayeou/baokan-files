Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: TASS reported from Moscow on January 15th: In response to questions posed by an editor of the "Danish Democracy" magazine regarding the Soviet Union's relations with Nordic countries, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, stated that the Soviet Union is willing to develop comprehensive friendly relations with Scandinavian countries on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality between both parties. Strengthening contact between the Soviet Union and Scandinavian countries will help transform Northern Europe into a region of genuine and lasting peace.

Sinnebeck asked what impact the deployment of atomic rockets in Denmark and Norway would have on the relations between Scandinavian countries and the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that this would cause significant harm to the relations between the Soviet Union and these countries. The deployment of such weapons would naturally make Denmark and Norway vulnerable to retaliation and would also pose a serious threat to other Nordic countries because it would deepen the risk of expanding atomic war in this traditionally peaceful region.

Khrushchev also pointed out that the establishment of atomic bases in Denmark and Norway would directly affect the security and sovereignty of Sweden and Finland. The people of these two countries would likely not be indifferent to this prospect.

Khrushchev welcomed the recent statements by Danish Prime Minister Hansen and Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen regarding their refusal to accept atomic weapons and establish rocket launching pads in their countries. He said that these steps taken by the two countries would not only help improve relations between the Soviet Union and them but would also help improve the international situation worldwide.

Sinnebeck asked whether Soviet leaders would make a formal visit to Scandinavian countries.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU said that the Soviet side had already expressed a positive attitude towards a visit to Denmark, Sweden, and Norway by Soviet government leaders. As for the timing of the visit, this still requires consultation between both parties.

Khrushchev pointed out that favorable conditions now exist for expanding and consolidating friendly relations between Soviet and Danish youth. For example, regional gatherings of young people from countries bordering the Baltic Sea, exchanges of youth delegations, and travel would be very beneficial.

In evaluating the current relations between Scandinavian countries and the Soviet Union, Khrushchev emphasized that the existing conditions in this regard have not yet been fully utilized. There is no doubt that a shared concern for consolidating peace in the Baltic Sea region will help the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Scandinavian countries. This common interest is of particular importance now because, regardless of the peaceful traditions and national interests of Scandinavian countries, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization insists on implementing its plans to militarize the countries of the Scandinavian and Baltic Sea regions, thereby exacerbating the situation in this region.

Khrushchev said that some individuals in Scandinavian countries are also involved in such activities, which contradicts the task of consolidating peace in the region. Khrushchev cited, for example, Denmark's participation in the plan to jointly establish a naval command in the Baltic Sea with West Germany and the United Kingdom.

In addition to questions about the Soviet Union's relations with Nordic countries, Sinnebeck also posed other questions to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

Sinnebeck asked Khrushchev whether the launch of the Soviet Union's two artificial earth satellites had significantly changed the balance of power between socialist and capitalist countries.

Khrushchev's answer to this question was affirmative. He emphasized that this change was in favor of socialist countries.

Sinnebeck asked Khrushchev when the Soviet Union would be able to catch up with the living standards of the United States.

Khrushchev pointed out that the living standards of the Soviet people have greatly improved recently. In many areas, such as medical facilities, organization of rest for working people, and several other aspects, the Soviet Union is now able to compete with any capitalist country, including the United States. Americans themselves have already acknowledged the achievements currently made by the Soviet Union in education. At the same time, Khrushchev compared the situation in the Soviet Union with the situation in the United States and emphasized that in the Soviet Union, the living standards of all people are much more balanced than in the United States because the Soviet Union no longer has exploiting classes, and the Soviet people are now busy building a communist society after building socialism. The Soviet Union eliminated unemployment long ago.

    赫鲁晓夫答“丹麦民主”杂志编辑问
    苏联愿同北欧国家共同致力和平
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在回答“丹麦民主”杂志的一位编辑所提出的一些关于苏联同北欧国家的关系的问题时说，苏联愿意在互相尊重国家主权、互不干涉内政和双方平等的基础上来发展它同斯堪的纳维亚各国的全面的友好关系。加强苏联同斯堪的纳维亚各国之间的接触，将会有助于把北欧变成一个真正永久和平的地区。
    辛内贝克问道，丹麦和挪威一旦配置原子火箭，这会对斯堪的纳维亚各国同苏联的关系发生怎么样的影响？
    赫鲁晓夫说，这将会对苏联同这些国家的关系产生重大的危害。配置这种武器自然会使丹麦和挪威可能受到反击，而且也会使北欧的其他国家受到严重威胁，因为，这样就会加深在这个传统的和平地区扩大原子战争的危险性。
    赫鲁晓夫同时指出，在丹麦和挪威建立原子基地，这就会直接关系到瑞典和芬兰的安全以及它们的主权。这两国人民未必会对这种前途漠不关心。
    赫鲁晓夫对丹麦首相汉森和挪威首相基哈德森不久以前发表的关于拒绝接受原子武器和在他们国家建立火箭发射台的声明表示欢迎。他说，这两个国家采取这种步骤不仅有助于改进苏联同它们之间的关系，而且有助于改善全世界的国际局势。
    辛内贝克问，苏联领导人会不会到斯堪的纳维亚国家作一次正式访问？
    苏共中央第一书记说，苏联方面对苏联政府领导人访问丹麦、瑞典和挪威的问题已经表示了肯定的态度。至于访问的时间，这还需要两方面进行协商。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在具备着扩大和巩固苏联和丹麦青年的友好关系的有利条件。比如，波罗的海沿岸各国青年举行区域性的联欢、互派青年代表团、旅行，这都会有很大益处。
    赫鲁晓夫在评价斯堪的纳维亚国家和苏联之间的目前的关系时强调指出，这方面现有的条件还远没有充分加以利用。毫无疑问，共同关心巩固波罗的海区域的和平，这会有助于苏联和斯堪的纳维亚国家间友好关系的发展。现在，这种共同的利害关系具有特别重要的作用，因为，北大西洋公约组织不顾斯堪的纳维亚国家的和平传统和民族利益，坚持实现他们要使斯堪的纳维亚和波罗的海区域的国家军国主义化的计划，从而使这一地区的局势尖锐化。
    赫鲁晓夫说，有一些斯堪的纳维亚国家的人士也参与了这种活动，这是同巩固这一地区的和平的任务矛盾的。赫鲁晓夫举例说，比如丹麦就参与了同西德和英国在波罗的海共同建立海军司令部的计划。
    除了关于苏联同北欧各国的关系的问题以外，辛内贝克还向苏共中央第一书记提出了其他一些问题。
    辛内贝克问赫鲁晓夫，苏联两个人造地球卫星的发射是不是大大地改变了社会主义国家同资本主义国家的力量对比？
    赫鲁晓夫对这个问题的答复是肯定的。他强调指出，这种改变是有利于社会主义国家的。
    辛内贝克问赫鲁晓夫，苏联在什么时候能够赶上美国的生活水平？
    赫鲁晓夫指出，近来苏联人民的生活水平已经大大提高了。在许多方面，譬如在医疗设施、组织劳动人民休养和其他若干方面，苏联现在就已经能够同包括美国在内的任何资本主义国家较量。美国人自己就已经承认目前苏联在教育方面所取得的成就。同时，赫鲁晓夫把苏联的情况和美国的情况加以比较并且强调指出，在苏联，全民生活水平要比美国均衡得多，因为苏联已经没有剥削阶级，苏联人民在建成社会主义后现在正在忙着建设共产主义社会。苏联老早就消灭了失业现象。
