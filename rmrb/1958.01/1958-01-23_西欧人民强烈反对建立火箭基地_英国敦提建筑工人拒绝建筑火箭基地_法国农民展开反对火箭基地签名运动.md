　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The struggle against establishing rocket bases in their own countries has become an urgent task for the Western European people's movement to defend peace. This struggle is currently unfolding rapidly, extensively, and deeply in various Western European countries.

　　The movement against establishing American rocket bases in Britain is developing. The Dundee branch of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers passed a resolution at a recent construction workers' conference stating that construction workers will refuse to build rocket bases. They also called on construction workers across Britain to emulate them.

　　The British Cooperative Union wrote to Acting Prime Minister Butler expressing opposition to the establishment of rocket bases, stating that these bases "cannot guarantee security and instead hinder attempts at disarmament and peace."

　　The Whitburn (a mining town in West Lothian) Town Council unanimously passed a resolution opposing the construction of rocket bases.

　　British Labour MP Frank Allaun, speaking at a meeting of the Cambridge Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said that the decision to establish rocket bases was "rash" and "absurd" because it put Britain on the "front line." He said, "Please do not forget that only five hydrogen bombs are enough to destroy our country." Allaun also pointed out that establishing American military bases in Britain would cost British taxpayers an additional 30 million pounds in taxes.

　　The French "National Committee for Farmers Defending Peace and Agricultural Development" called on all French farmers to support the signature campaign initiated by the French National Peace Council against the installation of rocket launch pads in France. The committee pointed out: Agreeing to cede French territory to set up rocket launch pads "is tantamount to making France an atomic desert in the event of an unfortunate war between the United States and the Soviet Union."

　　People from all walks of life in Italy have protested against the establishment of American rocket bases in Italy. Former Italian Prime Minister Parri published an article in the "Forum" magazine, condemning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to establish rocket bases in Europe. Parri pointed out: The NATO plan will "expose Italy to greater danger," and only maintaining peace can guarantee Italy's security. The Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti!" opposed the Italian government undertaking any obligations without parliamentary consent.

　　French and Greek Authorities
　　Readily Allow Their Territories to Be Used as Rocket Bases

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd dispatch: According to a TASS report from Paris: Parisian newspapers reported that the French Ambassador to the United States, Hervé Alphand, said in a speech in the United States on the 20th that rocket launching devices will be set up on French territory by the end of this year. Alphand stated that the French government fully agrees with the suggestion of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, American General Norstad, who is currently selecting areas for the establishment of rocket bases. Alphand said that the United States and France will sign a bilateral agreement on this issue "in the near future."

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd dispatch: Greek Foreign Minister Averoff said on the 20th that the Greek government would agree to establish atomic missile launch sites in Greece "if these launch sites are indispensable for its security."

    西欧人民强烈反对建立火箭基地
    英国敦提建筑工人拒绝建筑火箭基地
    法国农民展开反对火箭基地签名运动
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：反对在本国建立火箭基地的斗争，已经成为西欧人民保卫和平运动的迫切任务。这个斗争目前正在西欧各国迅速地、广泛深入地展开。
    反对在英国建立美国火箭基地的运动正在发展。英国全国建筑工人联合会敦提地方分会在最近召开的一次建筑工人大会上通过决议说，建筑工人们将拒绝建筑火箭基地。他们还号召英国全国的建筑工人都效法他们。
    英国合作社联合会写信给代理首相巴特勒表示反对建立火箭基地，这封信说，这些基地“不可能保证安全，反而妨碍裁军和和平的尝试”。
    威特伯恩（西娄西恩郡的矿工城）市议会一致通过一项决议，反对建筑火箭基地。
    英国工党议员弗兰克·阿隆在剑桥废除核武器试验委员会会议上说，决定建立火箭基地的行动是“轻率的”和“荒唐的”，因为这使得英国处在“最前线”。他说：“请不要忘记，只要五颗氢弹就可以毁灭我们的国家了。”阿隆还指出，在英国建立美国的军事基地将使得英国的纳税者多付出三千万英镑的捐税。
    法国“农民保卫和平与农业发展全国委员会”号召法国全体农民支持法国全国和平理事会创议的反对在法国设置火箭发射台的签名运动。这个委员会指出：同意出让法国领土来设置火箭发射台。“无异于要使法国在美国和苏联之间战争一旦不幸爆发时成为原子沙漠。”
    意大利各阶层人士纷纷抗议在意大利境内建立美国火箭基地。意大利前总理帕里在“论坛”杂志上发表文章，谴责北大西洋集团关于在欧洲建立火箭基地的计划。帕里指出：北大西洋集团的计划将“使意大利遭到更大的危险”，而只有维护和平，才能保证意大利的安全。社会党机关报“前进报”反对意大利政府在议会同意之前擅自承担任何义务。
    法国和希腊当局
  甘让国土充当火箭基地
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎报纸报道，法国驻美国大使埃尔弗·阿尔芳20日在美国发表的演说里说，今年年底将在法国领土上设置发射火箭的装置。阿尔芳表示，法国政府完全同意北大西洋公约组织欧洲盟军最高统帅、美国将军诺斯塔德的建议，诺斯塔德目前正在选择建立火箭基地的地区。阿尔芳说，美国和法国将“在最近时间内”就这一问题签订双边协定。
    据新华社22日讯　希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫20日说，希腊政府将同意在希腊建立原子导弹发射场，“如果这些发射场对于它的安全是不可缺少的话”。
