Mobilize the Whole Nation to Launch the Patriotic Health Campaign

In recent months, the people of the whole country, in response to the call of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have launched a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the Four Pests. Many city and local party and government leaders have personally campaigned among the masses and taken the lead in eliminating the Four Pests, setting off a high tide in the patriotic health campaign.

In our country, launching a large-scale patriotic health campaign is of extremely important significance. For more than a century, the Chinese people, under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, fought year after year, lived in misery, and suffered from successive famines and diseases. Taking plague alone, it occurred three times in Northeast China in 1910, 1920 and 1947, killing about 100,000 people; it occurred in Shaanxi and Shanxi in 1931, killing about 20,000 people; and from 1937 to 1949, about 20,000 people died of plague in Fujian Province. Highly contagious diseases such as malaria, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and smallpox often spread widely. Chronic tuberculosis, venereal diseases, and trachoma also spread extensively.

The harm caused by various diseases to the people was tragic. Fuxing Town in Simao County, Yunnan Province, originally had 35,000 people. Due to the extremely high prevalence of malaria, by the time of liberation, the town was deserted, with only 1,950 people remaining. The remaining 1,950 people were all "sick and weak," "lacking energy." Li Gao Village in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, was called "Village of Demons" due to the prevalence of various diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, malaria, and smallpox. Among them, in Xia Li Gao Village, 83 people died of typhoid out of 114 households. Twenty-nine households, including Xing Jinke and Wang Laijin, were completely wiped out, so that the neighboring villages spread the saying: "No daughter marries into Li Gao Village." Before liberation, the Chinese people suffered deeply, afflicted by poverty and disease, malnutrition, and exhaustion. People's lives were extremely miserable, and it was impossible to change their own sanitary environment and sanitary habits. Foreign bourgeois scholars called the Chinese nation "the sick man of East Asia." Only after liberation did conditions change. People had been liberated politically and economically and entered a socialist society. Only then was it possible to change living conditions and realize the ideal of a civilized and healthy life. Bad things can turn into good things. In the past, the Chinese people were unsanitary, sick, and dying, which was a bad thing, but the bad thing contained the factor of turning into a good thing. Unsantitariness and sickness prompted people to urgently demand hygiene and health after changing the fundamental conditions of being oppressed and impoverished. This is extremely favorable for carrying out the patriotic health campaign. Today, the Chinese people are determined to build the motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Such a great construction undertaking increasingly requires the rapid improvement of the people's cultural and health levels. Therefore, "eliminating the Four Pests" and "eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger people's health" have been put on the important agenda. Actively carrying out a mass, regular patriotic health campaign, its fundamental spirit, is to cultivate good habits of everyone paying attention to hygiene, every family loving cleanliness, to eliminate diseases, to invigorate everyone, to change customs and habits, and to transform the country. After this ideal is realized, our country can be truly transformed, and the title of "sick man of East Asia" will never return. At that time, a moving scene of everyone being strong and vigorous will appear among the people of the whole country.

Eliminating the Four Pests and eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people is a bold initiative. No one in human history has dared to propose it. This initiative can only be proposed and realized in a socialist country actively supported by the masses. In the so-called capitalist countries with material civilization, the rulers do not want to and cannot guide the broad masses of the people to do such a significant thing. But for the Chinese people, it is a completely achievable and gradually being implemented practical measure. As early as 1952, the Party and the government called for launching a patriotic health campaign centered on opposing the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism throughout the country. The people of the whole country enthusiastically responded to this call and shattered the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. By 1954, this large-scale movement had shifted to regular work to prevent disease and improve people's health. In 1956, the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" promulgated by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China further proposed the requirements for eliminating the Four Pests and eliminating the diseases that harm the people the most within twelve years. Under the call of the Central Committee, a larger-scale campaign to eliminate the Four Pests was launched throughout the country. Over the past six years, the patriotic health campaign has been gradually deepening. In the course of the movement, the people of the whole country have generally received health education, and the environmental and personal hygiene in urban and rural areas have greatly changed. Diseases that are most harmful to the people, such as plague and smallpox, have been brought under control; cholera has not occurred; and the incidence of general diseases has also decreased significantly. The "Four Pests" have been greatly reduced, and many "four-free" villages, towns, and units have emerged. Due to the great achievements of the patriotic health campaign and the reduction of diseases, the attendance rate of industry and agriculture has increased, ensuring the rapid development of the socialist construction cause. Many international friends have praised our great achievements in the patriotic health campaign. However, the Chinese people are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. "Eliminating the Four Pests" and "eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people" will not stop until this goal is completely achieved. The Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reiterated this requirement. The Party and the government, representing the wishes of the Chinese people, have issued a call to continue to move forward. In recent months, the national patriotic health campaign has made great progress. Large numbers of rats, sparrows, and overwintering mosquitoes and flies are being exterminated. Villages and streets that have achieved "four-free" have emerged one after another. The comprehensive competition in Beijing is in full swing. In Shanghai, under the slogan of eliminating seven pests, millions of citizens have been mobilized, and more than 80% of families have participated in the health campaign. Many provinces and cities have put forward the goal of eliminating the "Four Pests" within a few years. This movement has had a good start and has already entered a high tide.

However, on a national scale, there are still some cities and regions where party and government leaders do not pay enough attention to this movement, and the movement is not being carried out very enthusiastically in those areas. There are also a considerable number of towns and counties where party and government leaders have not yet begun to deploy the patriotic health campaign. Even in cities and villages where the movement has been enthusiastically launched, there are still some factories, institutions, schools, shops, and residential areas that have only made general mobilizations and have not really taken action. The blank spots in the movement must be eliminated, and the phenomenon of uneven development of the movement must be eliminated. Because the Four Pests are extremely stubborn enemies, if one household does not take action, the Four Pests will use this household as a base to reproduce rapidly. Only by mobilizing every household and everyone taking action can we ensure the complete elimination of the Four Pests.

In order to ensure the smooth development of this movement, it is also necessary to deeply resolve several ideological problems. First of all, it is necessary to repeatedly publicize to the masses the importance of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the Four Pests, and to publicize scientific health knowledge to the masses in a popular and in-depth manner, and to combine the explanation of scientific health knowledge with examples of past diseases suffered in the local area, in order to make the masses intimately realize the serious significance of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the Four Pests in their lives. Secondly, attention should be paid to persuading the leading cadres of various departments. Because the production and work of various units are generally relatively tight, it is easy to neglect health work. In factories, shops, institutions, and schools, if the leading cadres do not pay attention to it, the movement will not be thorough. At present, there are still many leading cadres who do not fully recognize the practical significance of the patriotic health campaign to the work of the unit they lead, and often emphasize that the work tasks are heavy and that the patriotic health campaign is in conflict with production, etc. It is necessary to start from the actual situation of each unit and use vivid examples to arouse the attention of the leading cadres. There are also individual leading cadres who know that the health situation of their unit is not good, but they are irresponsible and find it troublesome. This is a bureaucratic attitude that lacks a mass viewpoint. There are also some leading cadres who consider themselves special, do not respect the leadership of the local party and government, and do not implement the resolutions of the local party and government leadership. These two types of unit leading cadres should be given criticism, and should be reported to his superior for serious advice and education. There are also some cadres, intellectuals by origin, who despise physical labor and regard the patriotic health campaign as someone else's business. In the institution, he completely pushes these things to the logistics personnel; in the family, he pushes these things completely to the family nanny. He does not do it himself. This kind of thinking of indulging in ease and despising physical labor is also an obstacle to carrying out the health movement at present. The Party, Communist Youth League, and trade unions of all institutions and units should fight against this phenomenon. In coordination with propaganda work, it is necessary to widely publicize the effective scientific methods for eliminating the Four Pests and eliminating the diseases that are most harmful to the people, and teach the methods to the masses.

Winter is a good season to carry out the patriotic health campaign. All localities must concentrate their efforts to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows. A national-scale patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the Four Pests should be carried out in winter and spring. Eliminating one pest in winter is equivalent to eliminating dozens or hundreds in summer and autumn. But it is not enough to rely solely on shock attacks. In 1956, great achievements were made in "eliminating the Four Pests," but the leadership neglected the reproductive capacity and environmental adaptability of the "Four Pests," and once relaxed this work. In many places, the "Four Pests" have developed again. Therefore, the movement must have shock attacks, but also "ups and downs" and repeated sweeps. In a year, grasp the main seasons for eliminating the Four Pests, launch several shock attacks, and then shift to regular work at ordinary times, and establish some regular systems to gradually cultivate good hygiene habits for urban and rural people. This movement must also achieve urban-rural integration, organize institutions, schools, troops, and agricultural cooperatives to establish regular contact systems, and use urban feces and garbage to help rural areas increase fertilizer. Many regions are formulating plans for the patriotic health campaign, which is very necessary. The formulation of plans should be adapted to local conditions and should be based on the different work foundations, sanitary habits, and environmental climate characteristics of different regions; at the same time, it is necessary to fully estimate the enthusiasm of the masses after they are mobilized, and to fully estimate the arduousness of this movement.

The task is arduous, but it is necessary to carry out such a movement. This is a great feat of changing customs and habits and transforming the country. If we do our work well, our descendants will benefit endlessly. As long as we are determined, we can definitely do it. Hundreds of "four-free" villages have appeared in Shanxi Province. The Qile Village Agricultural Cooperative in Lechang County, Guangdong, and Nanxun Town in Zhejiang have already presented outstanding achievements to the people of the whole country. Ambitious Chinese people are not afraid of difficulties. Once the Chinese working people put forward their demands, they will realize them with the spirit of the foolish old man who moved the mountain and perseverance. The will of 600 million people is invincible and indestructible. Our ideal—a clean, hygienic, "four-free" civilized country—will surely be realized.

### 全民总动员开展爱国卫生运动

    全民总动员开展爱国卫生运动
    近几个月来，全国人民响应中共中央三中全会的号召，先后发动了以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。许多城市和地方的党政负责人都亲自向群众作宣传，亲自动手除四害，掀起了爱国卫生运动的高潮。
    在我们的国家里，开展一个规模宏大的爱国卫生运动，是有极其重大的意义的。一百多年以来，中国人民在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫下，征战连年，民不聊生，灾荒、疾病接踵而来。只就鼠疫一种疾病来说，1910年、1920年、1947年三次在东北流行，死亡人数约达十万人；1931年在陕西、山西流行，死亡约二万人；1937年到1949年福建省死于鼠疫的约两万人。疟疾、痢疾、伤寒、霍乱、天花等烈性传染病，经常广泛流行。慢性结核病、性病和砂眼蔓延范围也很广。
    各种疾病对人民的危害是惨痛的。云南省思茅县城区的复兴镇原有三万五千人，由于疟疾的超高度流行，到解放时全镇死的死逃的逃，只余下一千九百五十个人。这没有死的一千九百多人也都“七病八痨”，“有气无力”了。山西省屯留县的李高村叫作“病魔乡”，流行伤寒、痢疾、疟疾、天花各种疾病。其中下李高村有一百一十四户，患伤寒就死了八十三人；邢金科、王来金等二十九户死得绝了后，以至邻近村庄流传着一句话：“有女不嫁李高村”。解放前，中国人民灾难深重，贫病交加，营养不良，疲惫无力，人们的生活极为悲惨，根本没有可能改变自己的卫生环境和卫生习惯。外国的资产阶级学者们把中华民族称为“东亚病夫”。只有在解放以后，条件变了，人们已经在政治上经济上获得了解放，进入了社会主义社会，这时才有可能来改变生活条件，实现文明健康生活的理想。坏事是会变成好事的。过去中国人民不卫生、多病、死亡，这是坏事，但是坏事中就蕴藏着变好事的因素，不卫生和多病就促使人们在改变了被压迫和贫困等根本状况之后迫切地要求卫生和健康。这对开展爱国卫生运动来说，又是极为有利的好事。今天，中国人民决心把祖国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。这样一个伟大的建设事业，日益要求迅速提高人民的文化和健康水平。因此，“除四害”，“消灭危害人民健康最严重的疾病”，就被提到了重要的议事日程。积极开展群众的经常性的爱国卫生运动，它的根本精神，是为了养成人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的良好习惯，是为了消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造国家。这一理想实现后，我们的国家才能真正的得到改造，“东亚病夫”这一称号也将一去不复返。那时，在全国人民中将出现一个人人身强力壮，个个生龙活虎的动人景象。
    除四害，消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，这是一个大胆的倡议。在人类历史上还没有人敢于提出。这一倡议，只有人民群众积极拥护的社会主义国家才有可能提出并有可能实现。在所谓拥有物质文明的资本主义国家，统治者们根本不想也不可能去引导广大人民群众作这样一件有重大意义的事情。但在中国人民来说，却是一项完全可以实现的、而且已经在逐步实现的实际措施。早在1952年，党和政府就号召在全国范围内开展一个以反对美帝国主义细菌战为中心的爱国卫生运动。全国人民热烈地响应了这个号召，粉碎了美帝国主义的细菌战。到了1954年，这一规模宏大的运动转入了为防止疾病提高人民健康水平的经常工作。1956年，中共中央政治局颁发的“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”中，进一步提出十二年内消灭四害和消灭危害人民最大的疾病的要求。在中央的号召下，在全国开展了一个更大规模的除四害运动。六年来，爱国卫生运动逐步深入开展，在运动的过程中，全国人民普遍地受到了卫生教育，城乡环境卫生和个人卫生已经有了很大的变化。对人民危害最大的疾病，如鼠疫、天花，已经受到控制；霍乱没有发生；一般疾病的发病率也都显著下降。“四害”已经大为减少，并且出现了许多“四无”的村镇和单位。由于爱国卫生运动取得了巨大成绩和疾病的减少，使得工农业的出勤率提高，保证了社会主义建设事业的迅速开展。许多国际友人都盛赞我们爱国卫生运动的巨大的成就。但是，中国人民对已有的成就是不满足的。“除四害”，“消灭危害人民最严重的疾病”，不彻底达到这一目的，决不罢休。中共中央三中全会重申了这个要求。党和政府代表中国人民的心愿，提出了继续前进的号召。几个月来，全国爱国卫生运动已经有了很大的开展。大量的老鼠、麻雀和过冬的蚊子苍蝇正在被扑灭中。已经达到“四无”的乡村和街道相继出现。北京市全面的竞赛正热火朝天。上海市在消灭七害的口号下，已推动了几百万市民，80％以上的家庭都参加了卫生运动。许多省和市提出了在几年内消灭“四害”的奋斗目标。这一运动已经有了一个良好的开端，并且已经进入高潮。
    但是，在全国范围来说，还有一些城市和地方，党政负责人对这一运动的重视还不充分，运动在那些地区是开展得很不热烈。也还有相当数量的城镇和县，那里的党政负责人直到现在，还没有开始布置爱国卫生运动。就是在运动热烈开展起来的城市和乡村，也还有一些工厂、机关、学校、商店和居民区，只是作了一般的动员，没有真正行动起来。运动中的空白点必须消灭，运动开展不平衡的现象必须消除。因为四害是极为顽强的大敌，一户不动手，四害就会以这一户为根据地迅速繁殖起来，只有家家动员、人人动手，才能保证除尽四害。
    为了使这一运动能够顺利的开展，还必须深入的解决几个思想问题。首先必须反复地向群众宣传以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的重要意义，和通俗深入地向群众宣传科学的卫生知识，并且把科学的卫生知识的解释和本乡本土过去遭受病害的事例结合起来，才能使群众亲切地认识到以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动在他生活中的严重意义。其次，就是要注意说服各部门的领导干部。由于各单位的生产、工作一般比较紧张，很容易忽视卫生工作。在工厂、商店、机关、学校中，领导干部不重视，运动就不会彻底。目前还有不少领导干部，没有充分认识到爱国卫生运动对他所领导的单位的工作有何实际意义，往往是强调工作任务重，爱国卫生运动和生产有矛盾等等。这就必须从各个单位的实际情况出发，用生动的事例来引起领导干部的重视。也有个别的领导干部明知本单位卫生情况不好，但是不负责任，嫌麻烦。这是一种缺乏群众观点的官僚主义态度。还有某些领导干部以特殊自居，不尊重当地党政的领导，不执行当地党政领导的决议。对这两种单位的领导干部，应该给他们以批评，并且应该报请他的上级机关给予严肃劝告和教育。还有一些干部，知识分子出身，轻视体力劳动，把爱国卫生运动看作是别人的事。在机关里，他把这些事完全推给勤杂人员去作；在家庭里他又把这些事完全推给家属保姆去作。自己不动手。这种好逸恶劳，轻视体力劳动的思想，也是当前开展卫生运动的一种障碍。各机关单位的党、团、工会对这种现象应该进行斗争。配合着宣传工作，要把除四害和消灭对人民危害最严重的疾病的确实有效的科学办法，广为宣传，并且把作法教给群众。
    冬天是开展爱国卫生运动的好季节，各地必须集中力量消灭过冬的蚊、蝇、鼠、雀。在冬春两季应该开展一个全国规模的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。冬天消灭一个害虫，等于夏秋消灭几十几百个。但是仅仅依靠突击是不够的。1956年“除四害”获得了很大的成绩，但是领导上忽视了“四害”的繁殖能力和适应环境的能力，曾一度放松了这项工作，许多地方“四害”又有所发展。因此，运动要有突击，还要“几起几伏”和反复扫荡。在一年中抓住消灭四害的主要时令，突击几次，而平时则转入经常工作，并建立一些经常的制度，使城乡人民逐步养成讲求卫生的良好习惯。这一运动还必须作到城乡结合，组织机关、学校、部队和农业社建立经常的联系制度，把城市里的粪便、垃圾用去帮助农村增加肥料。许多地区正在拟制爱国卫生运动的规划，这是很必要的，拟制规划要因时因地制宜，要根据不同地区不同的工作基础和卫生习惯、环境气候的特点；同时既要充分估计群众发动起来以后的积极性，又要充分估计这一运动的艰巨性。
    任务是艰巨的，但是，开展这样一个运动是必要的。这是移风易俗改造国家的壮举，我们的工作作好了，我们的子孙万代都将得益无穷。只要我们有决心，我们是一定可以作到的。山西省出现了上百个“四无”村，广东乐昌县的岐乐村农业社、浙江的南浔镇，都已经拿出了出色的成就摆在全国人民的面前。有志气的中国人民是不怕困难的。中国劳动人民一经提出自己的要求，就将以愚公移山、始终不懈的精神来实现这个要求。六亿人民的意志是无战不胜无坚不摧的。我们的理想——一个清洁的、讲究卫生的“四无”的文明国家——一定会实现。
