Paoma Township Improves Water Conservancy Tools
Winter Production Labor Shortage Begins to Ease

(Reported by our newspaper) Paoma Township in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, relying on the masses, has improved tools for water conservancy construction, saving a large number of laborers to invest in other production.

Paoma Township's seven plans, including water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, require a total of 300,000 workdays. However, even if all the township's labor force works for three months, it would only amount to 210,000 workdays, a shortage of 90,000 workdays. Recently, after the vast majority of the township's labor force was invested in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, field management, sideline production, and other tasks could not be taken care of at the same time. In order to solve this problem, the Party Branch told the masses about the current labor shortage affecting the comprehensive development of winter production, and organized the masses to debate one question: should we compress the winter production plan due to insufficient labor, or should we find ways to overcome the labor shortage and ensure the comprehensive completion of the winter production plan? After debate, everyone unanimously proposed: In order to achieve a great leap forward this year and increase grain production by 50%, we must find ways to overcome the labor shortage and ensure the comprehensive completion of the winter production plan. As a result, a movement to offer suggestions for improving water conservancy tools was launched throughout the township. 544 commune members proposed methods for improving tools, and 366 people personally made tools. At present, more than 500 improved tools for digging soil, transporting soil, and ramming have been made in the township. On the construction sites, various types of carts pulled by oxen or pushed by people can be seen everywhere transporting soil; some of the heavy labor of manually carrying soil and lifting soil has begun to be replaced. Due to the improvement of tools, work efficiency has been greatly improved. The average work efficiency of each workday in the township has increased from 0.7 cubic meters to 2.5 cubic meters. In nine days, 9,396 workdays were saved, and the labor shortage has begun to ease.

Because Hubei's winter production tasks are heavy and there is a shortage of labor, the Provincial Party Committee has decided to promote the experience of this township throughout the province.

    跑马乡改进兴修水利工具
    冬季生产中劳力不足现象开始缓和
    本报讯　湖北当阳县跑马乡依靠群众，改进兴修水利的工具，节约出大批劳力投入其他生产。
    跑马乡的兴修水利、积肥等七项计划，共需三十万个工。但全乡劳力全部出勤三个月，也只有二十一万个工，尚差九万个工。最近全乡以绝大部分劳力投入兴修水利后，积肥、田间管理、副业生产等，都无法兼顾。为了解决这个问题，党总支把当前劳力不足，影响冬季生产全面开展的情况告诉群众，组织群众辩论一个问题：让劳力不足，压缩冬季生产计划呢，还是想法克服劳力不足，保证全面完成冬季生产计划？经过辩论，大家一致提出：为了今年大跃进，增产粮食50％，必须想法克服劳力不足，保证全面完成冬季生产计划。于是全乡开展了一个改进兴修水利工具的献计运动，有五百四十四个社员提出改进工具的办法，有三百六十六人亲自动手做工具。目前全乡在挖土、运土、打夯等方面改进的工具达五百多件。在工地上，到处可以看见牛拖着、人推着的形形色色的车子运土；人工挑土、抬土等繁重劳动有部分开始得到代替。由于工具的改进，工效大大提高。全乡每个工的平均工效由原来零点七方提高到二点五方。九天当中，节约劳力九千三百九十六个，劳力紧张的现象开始缓和。
    由于湖北冬季生产任务繁重，劳力不足，省委决定把这个乡的经验在全省推广。
