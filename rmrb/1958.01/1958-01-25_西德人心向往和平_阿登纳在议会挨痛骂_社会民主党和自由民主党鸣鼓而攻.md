Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: Bonn dispatch: West Germany's opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party, today unanimously criticized the Adenauer government's rude rejection of Poland's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe during the foreign policy debate in the Federal Parliament. Observers believe that it is a rare phenomenon in the West German parliament that the two opposition parties are so clearly opposed to the Adenauer government on issues related to the vital interests of all German people, which to some extent reflects the public sentiment in West Germany.

In today's Federal Parliament debate, Adenauer reiterated his repeatedly expressed position, saying that "patient preparatory work" must be carried out first, perhaps a meeting of foreign ministers, before an East-West summit can be held. He also once again rejected Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He expressed concern that accepting Poland's proposal would lead to the collapse of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Foreign Minister Brentano, in his long speech, insisted on a policy of "strength." He not only rejected the East German government's proposal for German reunification through the establishment of a confederation by the two Germanys, but also rejected Poland's plan.

Mende, chairman of the Free Democratic Party's parliamentary group, spoke and severely criticized Adenauer. He pointed out that Adenauer's dictatorial means of creating a fait accompli on major issues, such as refusing to hold a foreign policy debate before the NATO Paris meeting and before replying to Bulganin's letter, were not in accordance with the "democratic spirit."

Mende's accusation angered the members of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union, who immediately shouted loudly. Whistles, roars, table-thumping and stomping feet immediately resounded in the parliament hall, and the speaker repeatedly asked to maintain order but to no avail. Amidst the noise, Mende protested loudly, saying: It is clear that the opposition party is not allowed to speak here! We cannot let the Federal Parliament degenerate into the Reichstag of the past...

After order was restored, Mende continued, the Free Democratic Party believes that the East and West must negotiate, and that Soviet and Western troops must withdraw from East and West Germany simultaneously. He also believes that building missile launch sites in West Germany is a "military stupidity."

Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer criticized Adenauer for saying he wanted to negotiate with the Soviet Union, but lacking sincerity in his heart. He reiterated that the Social Democratic Party supports Poland's proposal, believing that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe "will be a start and may become a bridge." Ollenhauer demanded that West Germany clearly state that it would not use nuclear weapons and, together with Denmark and Norway, refuse to set up medium- and long-range missile bases on its territory.

Former Free Democratic Party Chairman Dehler blamed Adenauer and his party members for talking about German reunification but not sincerely striving to achieve it. Former Interior Minister and Social Democrat Heinemann also questioned Adenauer whether he intended to resign.

The Social Democratic Party put forward a proposal requesting a halt to the testing of nuclear weapons for a certain period, not to equip the West German army with nuclear weapons, not to build medium- and long-range missile bases in West Germany, and to support the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party also jointly put forward a proposal requesting the government to begin negotiations with Poland on the establishment of diplomatic relations.

Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union and the German Party, which participated in the government, also jointly put forward a proposal. In view of strong domestic pressure, this proposal vaguely advocated that the government should strive to hold an East-West summit, while emphasizing that "diplomatic preparations" must be made first. It said that such preparations would be carried out at a meeting of foreign ministers if appropriate.

The West German Federal Parliament finally voted by a show of hands to pass the proposal put forward by the government party, rejected the proposal of the Social Democratic Party, and submitted the joint proposal of the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party to the parliamentary committee for further study.

    西德人心向往和平
    阿登纳在议会挨痛骂
    社会民主党和自由民主党鸣鼓而攻
    据新华社柏林23日电　波恩消息：西德的反对党社会民主党和自由民主党今天在联邦议院的外交政策辩论中，一致抨击阿登纳政府粗暴地拒绝了波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器区的计划。观察家们认为，这两个反对党在关系到全体德国人民切身利益的问题上同阿登纳政府如此鲜明地对立，这在西德议会中还是罕见的现象，它在一定程度上反映了西德的人心向背。
    在今天的联邦议院辩论中，阿登纳重申他过去一再表示过的立场，说什么必须先进行“耐心的准备工作”，或许是举行外交部长会议，然后才能举行东西方高级会议。他还再次拒绝波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议。他表示担心接受波兰的建议会导致北大西洋集团的垮台。
    外长勃伦塔诺在他的长篇发言中坚持“实力”政策。他不但拒绝了民主德国政府所提出的由两个德国成立邦联来实现德国重新统一的建议，而且也拒绝了波兰的计划。
    自由民主党议会党团主席蒙德发言，猛烈抨击阿登纳。他指出，阿登纳在北大西洋集团巴黎会议开会之前以及在给布尔加宁复信之前都拒绝举行外交政策辩论，这种在重大问题上造成既成事实的独裁手段是不符合“民主精神”的。
    蒙德的责难触怒了阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的议员，他们立刻大叫大喊起来，议会大厅里口哨声、吼叫声、拍桌子和跺脚声顿时响成一片，议长屡次要求保持秩序都无效。蒙德在鼓噪声中高声抗议说：这显然是不让反对党在这里讲话了！我们不能让联邦议院堕落成为当年的帝国议会……
    秩序恢复后，蒙德接着说，自由民主党认为东西方必须谈判，并且认为苏联军队和西方军队必须同时撤出东、西德。他还认为，在西德建立导弹发射台是“军事上的蠢事”。
    社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔批评阿登纳嘴里虽然说要同苏联谈判，但是心里缺乏诚意。他重申社会民主党赞成波兰的建议，认为建立中欧无原子武器区“将是一个开始，或许可以成为一座桥梁”。奥伦豪尔要求西德明白表示不使用原子武器，并且同丹麦和挪威一道拒绝在自己的领土上设置中程和远程导弹基地。
    前自由民主党主席戴勒责备阿登纳和他的党徒虽然谈论德国重新统一，却并不衷心争取这件事实现。前内政部长、社会民主党人海?曼也质问阿登纳是否打算辞职。
    社会民主党提出一个提案，要求在一定期间停止试验原子武器，不用原子武器装备西德军队，不在西德建立中程和远程导弹基地，并且支持在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。社会民主党和自由民主党还联合提出一个提案，要求政府着手同波兰谈判建立外交关系问题。
    阿登纳的基督教民主联盟和参加政府的德意志党也联合提出一个提案。鉴于国内的强大压力，这个提案含糊地主张政府为谋求举行东西方最高级会议而尽力，同时又强调必须先作好“外交准备工作”。它说，如果适宜，就在一次外交部长会议上进行这种准备。
    西德联邦议院最后举手表决通过了政府党提出的提案，而否决了社会民主党的提案，并且把社会民主党和自由民主党的联合提案送交议会委员会作进一步研究。
