Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The Ministry of Geology will organize over five hundred field geological survey and exploration teams this year to find mineral resources for the Second Five-Year Plan and the Third Five-Year Plan.

This news was obtained by our reporter today from the National Geological Bureau Chiefs Conference convened by the Ministry of Geology. The conference made preliminary arrangements for the Ministry of Geology's geological exploration work in 1958.

According to the conference's deployment, there are more than 500 mineral survey and exploration projects this year, an increase of more than 200 from last year. In addition to organizing a large number of specialized single-mineral prospecting teams, more than 90 comprehensive prospecting teams searching for various minerals have also been organized. Single-mineral prospecting teams and comprehensive prospecting teams will search for new mineral deposits in hundreds of regions across the country. Geological exploration teams will explore various minerals in more than 300 mineral deposits across the country this year. This year, it is required to prove definite reserves of 46 kinds of minerals, an increase of 21 from last year.

An important task of prospecting and exploration this year is to vigorously search for nickel, oil, gold, as well as non-metallic and rare metal resources urgently needed for national construction.

The tasks of prospecting and exploring iron, manganese, coal, copper, lead, zinc, phosphorus, tin, tungsten, and molybdenum minerals are also quite heavy this year. In addition to proving definite reserves, new mineral deposits must also be found. In particular, new coal deposits must be found in the south, and new manganese and phosphorus mineral deposits must be found in the north, to change the situation of coal shortage in the south and phosphorus and manganese shortage in the north. At the same time, the uneven regional distribution of other mineral species must be changed as soon as possible to ensure the rational distribution of productive forces in the country.

In order to meet the needs of local industrial development, considerable efforts will also be made this year to survey and explore small and medium-sized mineral deposits for local areas. The number of small and medium-sized mineral deposit survey and exploration projects has increased significantly this year compared to last year.

This year, the Ministry of Geology also plans to send more than a dozen hydrogeological engineering teams to more than a dozen provinces to survey water sources, create conditions for the construction of water conservancy projects, and provide geological data for some major projects.

In order to ensure the realization of this year's geological exploration plan, the meeting decided to complete more work than last year with a small increase in investment. According to preliminary plans, geological exploration investment will increase by 8.8% this year compared to last year, and capital construction investment will decrease by 45% compared to last year, but all types of workload will be greatly increased compared to last year. Among them, mechanical core drilling footage will reach about 1.9 million meters, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year, underground and mountain workload will increase by about 38% compared to last year, and geological survey workload will increase by about 48% compared to last year.

The meeting formulated specific measures to ensure "spending less money and doing more things," requiring the vast number of employees in the geological exploration departments to improve work efficiency and quality, widely adopt and promote new technical methods, improve enterprise management, and overcome all waste. It is required that the average efficiency of each drilling rig reaches more than 200 meters per month this year, an increase of about 6% compared to last year, while saving 5% to 7% of geological exploration investment.

The meeting believes that as long as leaders at all levels exert their full efforts and mobilize the vast number of employees to tap their potential, it is entirely possible to find more and better reserve mineral deposits and prove more mineral reserves with less money.

    为今后十年建设找矿藏
    地质部今年将出动五百多个普查勘探队
    新华社24日讯　地质部今年将组织五百多个野外地质普查队和勘探队，为第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划寻找矿产资源。
    这是本社记者今天从地质部召开的全国地质局长会议上得到的消息。这次会议对地质部1958年地质勘探工作初步作了安排。
    按照会议的部署，今年矿产普查项目和勘探项目共有五百多项，比去年增加二百多项。今年除了组织大批专门寻找一种矿产的单项普查队以外，还组织了九十多个寻找多种矿产的综合普查队。单项普查队和综合普查队将在全国几百个地区寻找新的矿产地。地质勘探队今年要在全国三百多个矿产地勘探各种矿产。今年要求探明一定储量的矿产共有四十六种，比去年增加二十一种。
    今年普查勘探的一项重要任务，是大力寻找国家建设急需的镍、石油、黄金，以及非金属、稀有金属等资源。
    今年普查勘探铁、锰、煤、铜、铅、锌、磷、锡、钨、钼等矿产的任务也相当重，除了要探明一定的储量以外，还要找新的矿产地，特别是在南方要找到煤的新产地，在北方要找到锰、磷等矿产的新产地，以改变南方缺煤、北方少磷少锰的情况，同时也要尽快地改变其他一些矿种地区分布不平衡的情况，保证国家合理地分布生产力。
    为适应地方工业发展的需要，今年还要用相当的力量为地方普查勘探中、小型的矿产地。今年中、小型矿产地普查勘探项目比去年增加了许多。
    今年，地质部还打算派出十几个水文工程地质队，到十多个省份勘察水源，为兴修水利工程创造条件，并且为一些重大工程提供地质资料。
    为了保证实现今年的地质勘探计划，会议决定在增加投资不多的情况下，比去年完成更多的工作量。根据初步计划，今年地质勘探投资比去年增加8.8％，基本建设投资比去年减少45％，但是各种工作量都比去年大大增加。其中机械岩心钻探进尺将达一百九十万公尺左右，比去年增加40％以上，地下山地工作量比去年增加38％左右，地质测量工作量比去年增加48％左右。
    会议拟订了保证做到“少花钱、多办事”的具体措施，要求地质勘探部门广大职工提高工作效率和工作质量，广泛采用和推广新的技术方法，改善企业管理，克服一切浪费；要求今年每台钻机每月平均效率达到二百公尺以上，比去年提高6％左右，同时节约地质勘探投资5％到7％。
    会议认为，只要各级领导干部鼓足干劲，发动广大职工挖掘潜力，完全有可能在花钱少的情况下，找到更多更好的后备矿产地，探明更多的矿产储量。
