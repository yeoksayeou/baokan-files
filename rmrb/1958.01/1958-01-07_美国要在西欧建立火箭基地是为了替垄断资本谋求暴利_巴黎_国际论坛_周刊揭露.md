    U.S. to Build Rocket Bases in Western Europe to Seek Huge Profits for Monopoly Capital
    Paris "International Forum" Weekly Reveals
    (Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 6) The "International Forum" weekly recently published an article by Michel O'Ala stating that American leaders also regard the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an economically significant "battlefield" for the United States, as a market for dumping surplus products from the American military-industrial complex. The new U.S. plan to establish rocket bases in Western Europe is aimed at significantly increasing military spending, "stimulating" the American economy, and seeking greater profits for American monopoly capital.
    O'Ala said that until recently, most of the funds the United States used for so-called "defense" were invested in military facilities within the United States. These large-scale military investments were used to build aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, bombers, hydrogen bombs, and factories and shipyards to manufacture these weapons. U.S. national expenditures alone reached several hundred billion dollars, and only because of this investment could American economic activity maintain a "relatively satisfactory" level.
    O'Ala pointed out that some people in the American ruling group are not satisfied with the current scale of military expansion. He said that when Eisenhower was elected President of the United States five years ago, some American leaders unanimously launched a large-scale propaganda campaign advocating the establishment of a new "defense system" based primarily on reconnaissance radar and interceptor rockets on and around American territory. This propaganda, called "Operation Candor," lasted for several months, and a plan to immediately invest 100 billion dollars was also proposed. Initially, it seemed that Eisenhower secretly supported this plan, but because he was still bound by his election promises and worried about the economic and social consequences of the plan causing budget imbalances and worsening inflation, he could not forcefully implement it at that time. At that time, "Operation Candor" failed in terms of the original goal. However, other, more limited and less stimulating actions taken for the same purpose achieved success, partially compensating for this failure. The United States recklessly built a large number of radars, missiles, and various new weapons; and the financial groups that advocated "Operation Candor" also strengthened their position, and their representatives occupied key positions within the government; they immediately intervened to use national investment for their cause. In this regard, the U.S. government spent hundreds of billions of dollars. At the same time, everyone who advocated increasing military spending also invariably advocated maintaining and developing foreign "aid" in order to use foreign "aid" to justify budget deficits and inflation.
    O'Ala said, what is the U.S. government seeking today? It mainly seeks to use the situation created by the Soviet Union's technological achievements and the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to relaunch "Operation Candor" in a new way and achieve in Western Europe the goals that failed to be achieved in the United States five years ago.
    O'Ala said that the U.S. recently proposed a plan at the Paris conference to establish missile bases in Western Europe. This plan is precisely to realize the facilities that the advocates of "Operation Candor" had hoped to build in the past. Because in terms of light missile bases, it would cost roughly an estimated ten billion dollars to build each stronghold. And the unit cost of establishing heavy-duty installations suitable for launching "Atlas" or "Jupiter" missiles may be between 250 million and 500 million dollars. In short, the effort that the United States intends to engage in under the cover of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is mainly to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in a very short period of time to create what economists in power in the United States believe is the "only 'sudden prosperity' capable of stopping the total crisis threatening the United States."

### 美国要在西欧建立火箭基地是为了替垄断资本谋求暴利  巴黎“国际论坛”周刊揭露

    美国要在西欧建立火箭基地是为了替垄断资本谋求暴利
    巴黎“国际论坛”周刊揭露
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：“国际论坛”周刊最近刊载密歇尔·奥阿拉一篇文章说，美国领导人也是把北大西洋公约组织当作美国经济意义上的“战场”，当作倾销美国军备工业的剩余产品的市场。美国目前要在西欧建立火箭基地的新计划，是要以此来大量增加军费开支，“刺激”美国经济，而为美国垄断资本谋求更大的利润。
    奥阿拉说，在最近时期以前，美国用于所谓“防务”的大部资金都是投在美国国内的军事设施上的。这些大规模军事投资是用来建造航空母舰、原子潜水艇、轰炸机、氢弹以及制造这些武器的工厂和造船厂等等，单是美国国家的支出，就达到好几千亿美元，只是由于这种投资，美国的经济活动才能够保持“相对令人满意”的水平。
    奥阿拉指出，美国统治集团里一部分人是不满足于目前的扩军规模的。他说，当艾森豪威尔五年前当选为美国总统的时候，美国的一部分领导人曾经一致发动了一场大规模宣传，主张在美国领土上和美国领土周围建立主要是以侦察雷达和截击火箭为基础的新的“防御体系”。这场定名为“坦率行动”的宣传进行了好几个月，并且还提出了立即投资一千亿美元的计划。最初看来艾森豪威尔是暗中支持这一方案的，但是，由于他仍然受到选举诺言的束缚，由于担心这个方案将引起预算不平衡和通货膨胀恶化等经济和社会方面的后果，他当时不可能强行实施这个计划。当时从原定的目标来看，“坦率行动”是失败了。但是，另一些为同样目的而进行的比较有限的、刺激性较少的行动获得了成就，从而部分地弥补了这一失败。美国不顾一切地大量建造了雷达、导弹和种种新式武器；而倡导“坦率行动”的金融集团也加强了它们的地位，它们的代表在政府内部占据了关键性的职位；立即出面干预，把国家投资用于它们的事业上。在这方面，美国政府开支了数百亿美元。同时，凡是主张增加军费的人也毫无例外都主张维持和发展对外“援助”，以便利用对外“援助”来为预算赤字、通货膨胀辩解。
    奥阿拉说，美国政府今天所谋求的是什么呢？主要是利用由于苏联技术成就而造成的局面和北大西洋组织的存在，来以新的方式重新发动“坦率行动”，在西欧实现五年前在美国未能实现的目的。
    奥阿拉说，美国最近在巴黎会议上提出在西欧建立导弹基地的计划。这个计划正是实现鼓吹“坦率行动”的人们以往希望建造的设施。因为在轻型导弹基地方面，建立每一据点粗略估计都得花费十亿美元。而建立适宜于发射“阿特拉斯”式或“丘辟特”式导弹的重型装置单位造价可能在二亿五千万至五亿美元之间。简而言之，美国打算在北大西洋公约组织掩盖下从事的努力，主要是要在很短的时期内投资数百亿美元，以制造据美国当权的经济学家认为“唯一能够阻止威胁着美国的总危机的‘突然繁荣’”。
