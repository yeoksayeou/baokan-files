    A New Starting Point
    Yan Ling
    As the new year begins, we enter a new era once again.

    In the era of the First Five-Year Plan, we worked enthusiastically and well. We won victories every year on the agricultural front. Agricultural cooperativization was achieved many years ahead of schedule, and the total output value of agricultural and sideline production, grain output, and cotton output all exceeded the original plan. In the first year of the promulgation of the great "Forty Articles" program for developing agriculture, twenty-nine counties and cities across the country reached and exceeded the grain unit yield targets stipulated in the "Forty Articles" eleven years ahead of schedule; in the second year, the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, according to preliminary statistics, another forty counties and cities caught up with those twenty-nine counties and cities.

    The first spring plowing of the Second Five-Year Plan is about to arrive, and it has already begun in the southernmost part of our country. This is by no means a simple "new beginning," but a starting point for advancing towards a new peak. The past two years have only been a preliminary demonstration of the collective agricultural economy that has just been established. Although "a newborn calf fears no tiger," some of the momentum of rushing and fighting hard was displayed in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956; but, after all, it was a "newborn calf," lacking both experience and perseverance. When some hostile forces in nature and society came out to block the way, some "calves" did not resolutely fight and forge ahead, but stopped, dodged, or even retreated a few steps. After the second half of 1956, that momentum was not seen in many places. If it were not for this, the number of counties and cities reaching the output targets stipulated in the "Forty Articles" in 1957 would not have been just sixty-five, but many more.

    Regret? Sigh? Be discouraged? None of that is useful. We should draw necessary experiences and lessons from the past, but we must not always immerse our thoughts in the past. Do not mistake the countercurrent by the river as the mainstream, nor mistake the whirlpool in the heart of the river as the rapid current. We are the masters of the world, the masters of life, and the masters of our own destiny. We must always face the future with confidence, and not always twist our necks to look back, nor always circle in one place. We can no longer say things like "lack of experience." If there was no experience two years ago, why is there still no experience after two years of practice? If you don't have experience yourself, haven't many examples already been made in other places? Don't say discouraging things like "the conditions are not good." Haven't many areas with very poor natural conditions also moved to the forefront? "If others have done it, why can't we do it?" Write this sentence down today as your motto, and read it once every day! Today is a new starting point; in the final, let's see who the winner is!

    If you have already reached the program target, does that mean you have reached the finish line? No! Our great communist cause has no end. It is glorious to have reached the target, and it is even more glorious to have reached the target ahead of schedule. However, in the long journey of creating an increasingly beautiful new world, this is another new starting point. Those who have only reached the target in one or two projects have even less reason to think that they no longer need to put in greater efforts. Every one of the "Forty Articles" must be realized; after realizing the "Forty Articles," we must give greater play to our initiative and creativity, and set out "Fifty Articles," "Eighty Articles," and "One Hundred Articles" to climb one new peak after another, full of exotic flowers and herbs. Many pioneers have already set higher goals and have bravely, resolutely, and practically embarked on a new journey. Wonderful! Let us all applaud and cheer for them, and at the same time, keep up with them closely!

    新的起点
    燕凌
    一元复始，我们又跨入一个新的年代。
    第一个五年计划的年代，我们干得挺欢，也干得很好。在农业战线上，年年打胜仗。农业合作化提前许多年实现了，农业副业总产值、粮食产量和棉花产量都超额完成了原定计划。发展农业的伟大的“四十条”纲领公布的第一年，全国就有二十九个县市提前十一年达到了和超过了“四十条”里规定的粮食单位产量指标；第二年，第一个五年计划的最后一年，据初步统计，又有四十个县市赶上了那二十九个县市。
    第二个五年计划的第一次春耕就要到来了，在我国的最南端的土地上已经开始了。这决不是简单的“一元复始”，而是向新的高峰前进的起点。过去的两年，只不过是刚刚建立起来的集体农业经济的锋芒初试。虽然“初生之犊不畏虎”，在1955年冬天1956年春天已经施展出来了一些猛冲猛打的干劲；但是，毕竟是“初生之犊”，既缺少经验，也缺少毅力。当碰到自然界和社会上的一些敌对的力量出来拦住去路的时候，有一些“牛犊”不是坚决斗争，奋勇前进，而是停了下来、躲避开来，甚至倒退几步。1956年下半年以后，在许多地方，看不到了那股干劲。如果不是这样，1957年达到“四十条”规定的产量指标的，决不会只是六十五个县市，而会是更多更多。
    懊悔吗？叹息吗？垂头丧气吗？都没有用。应当从过去了的事情中间吸取必要的经验和教训，可是，决不能老是把思想沉溺在过去了的事情里边。不要错把河边的逆流当作主流，也不要错把河心的漩涡当作激流。我们是世界的主人，是生活的主人，是我们自己的命运的主人，我们要永远满怀着信心面对着未来，而不要老是扭着脖子向后瞧，也不要老是在一个地方兜圈子。不能再说“缺乏经验”之类的话了。两年前没有经验，经过两年的实践，为什么还会没有经验？自己没有经验，在别的地方不是已经做出许多榜样了吗？也不要再说“条件不好”之类的泄气话了。许多自然条件很不好的地区，不是也走到最前列了吗？“别人做到了的，我们为什么做不到？”今天，就把这句话写下来作为自己的座右铭，每天念它一遍吧！今天，就是新的起点；在决赛中，看究竟谁是优胜者！
    已经达到纲要指标的，就算已经跑到终点了吗？不！我们的伟大的共产主义事业是没有终点的。达到了指标是光荣的，提前达到了指标更是光荣的。可是，创造日益美好的新世界的长途中，这又是新的起点。只在一个两个项目上达到了指标的，更没有理由认为已经不需要拿出更大的力量来。“四十条”条条要实现；实现了“四十条”，还要发挥更大的积极性创造性，定出“五十条”“八十条”“一百条”来，攀登一个又一个长满奇花异草的新的高峰。许多先行者已经悬起了更高的目标，勇敢地坚决地踏实地走上了新的行程。好啊！我们大家为他们鼓掌欢呼，同时也紧紧地追赶上去吧！
