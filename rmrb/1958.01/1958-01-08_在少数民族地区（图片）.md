    In Minority Areas
    Not Feeding a Single Grain of Rice
    Pigs are Big and Fat
    The feeders of Huayan Agricultural Cooperative in Anshun County, Guizhou Province, fed sixty piglets without using a single grain of food. Instead, they used alternative feed such as duckweed, carrot leaves, pumpkin, rice bran, wheat bran, and distillers' grains. After half a year of mixed feeding, all the piglets are now big and fat.

    一片薄叶传深情
    在广西，僮族青年男女善吹树叶。一叶接唇，就能够吹出各种美妙的民歌，音调悠扬悦耳，在很远的地方都能听见，有时僮族姑娘们也常吹树叶来传达爱情。
