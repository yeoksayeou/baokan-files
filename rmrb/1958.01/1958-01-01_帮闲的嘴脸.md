　　The Face of a Lackey
　　When Egypt took back the banks and companies of Western colonialists a year ago, the "New York Times" said: "Due to the loss of foreign capital, foreign aid, and much-needed management skills, Egypt's already shaky economy will become even more difficult..."
　　Now, when the Indonesian people rise up against the Dutch colonialists, the "New York Times" is saying again: "Indonesians are already starving, shipping has come to a standstill, and rice prices are soaring..." It's as if without the colonialists, the Indonesian people would not be able to survive.
　　However, the facts in Egypt prove that without the colonialists' "capital," "aid," and "management skills," the Egyptian people are managing their own country very well. Similarly, without the Dutch colonialists, Indonesians will not only survive, but will certainly live better. The "New York Times"'s arbitrary slander of the Indonesian people only exposes its face as a colonialist lackey.

    帮闲的嘴脸
    当一年前埃及把西方殖民者的银行、公司收回来的时候，“纽约时报”曾经说：“由于丧失了外国资本、外国的援助和非常需要的管理才能，埃及摇摇欲坠的经济更加困难……”
    现在，印度尼西亚人民起来反对荷兰殖民者的时候，“纽约时报”又在说：“印度尼西亚人已经在挨饿，航运已经陷于停顿，米价疯狂高涨……。”好像没有殖民者，印度尼西亚人民就会活不下去似的。
    可是，埃及的事实证明，没有殖民者的“资本”、“援助”和“管理才能”，埃及人民把自己的国家管理得很好。同样，没有荷兰殖民者，印度尼西亚人不但不会活不下去，并且一定会生活得更好。“纽约时报”对印度尼西亚人民的任意诽谤，只暴露了它的殖民主义帮闲者的嘴脸。
