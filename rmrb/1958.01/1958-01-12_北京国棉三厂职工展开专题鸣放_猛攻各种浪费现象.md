    Resolutely Oppose Waste, Persist in Building the Country Through Thrift and Diligence
    Beijing No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Mill Workers Launch Special Criticism and Airing of Views
    Fiercely Attacking Various Wasteful Phenomena
    Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: Workers at the Beijing No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Mill recently exposed shocking wasteful phenomena in various aspects of the factory during a special criticism and airing of views campaign focused on "improving quality and opposing waste." Waste caused by poor product quality and the stockpiling of machinery, materials, and raw materials alone amounted to over 200,000 yuan in the past year.
    The factory had more than eleven types of machinery, materials, and raw materials stockpiled in the warehouse for over a year, with a value of more than 133,000 yuan. The entire factory consumes only a little over one kilogram of heald cord per month, while the warehouse has enough stockpiled to last for eighteen years. Due to poor planning, only water pumps were purchased, but no boilers were bought, resulting in the pumps being unusable and a waste of more than 29,000 yuan. The workers were most dissatisfied with the more than 2,500 sanitary napkins stockpiled in the warehouse. Some had already deteriorated due to the passage of time. This item alone amounted to more than 1,300 yuan. The workers indignantly said: Sanitary napkins are originally provided by the workers themselves. Why did the public buy so many and stockpile them? Whose responsibility is this? Don't they feel the pain?
    The factory uses good quality raw cotton in its production, and the amount of yarn used for weaving is also large, but the quality of the woven cloth is very low. Losses caused by this alone amounted to more than 80,000 yuan in the months of September, October, and November last year. The planning section personnel calculated three accounts based on the production situation in these three months last year: First, the actual yarn consumption of the entire factory in these three months was 7,901 kilograms more than the national advanced target, amounting to more than 25,900 yuan. If this yarn were woven into cloth, it could weave 58,831 meters, enough for 11,766 people to make a set of clothes each. Second, because the quality of the yarn and cloth was poor, good cotton was desperately used, resulting in a significant increase in costs and a loss of 39,000 yuan in three months. Third, out of the 345,872 pieces of cloth produced in three months, 35,817 pieces were substandard. These substandard cloths had to be sold at low prices, resulting in a reduction of more than 22,200 yuan in national revenue.
    Workers revealed that poor production management and incomplete systems also caused significant waste. For example, the sorting workshop does not strictly enforce the regulation of 40.22 meters in length per piece of cloth. Many workers arbitrarily increase the length, with city cloth increasing to 40.38 meters per piece and fine plain cloth increasing to 40.41 meters per piece. As a result of the increased length, 13,973 meters of cloth were given away for nothing in the three months of last year, resulting in a loss of more than 24,800 yuan.
    Workers also revealed the waste caused by leading cadres emphasizing ostentation in their lives. The factory's conference room had red corduroy-backed wooden chairs that were originally sturdy, durable, simple, and beautiful, but the factory leaders thought they were not good enough. With a stroke of the pen, they ordered the purchasing staff to buy sixty-five leather chairs, wasting more than 1,500 yuan. Many people said, why is the factory director so generous with the country's money?
    The exposure of waste in various aspects shocked the factory's leaders and all the workers, and they received a most vivid education on running enterprises diligently and thriftily and cherishing national property. Now, the factory leaders are further mobilizing the workers to continue to criticize and air their views on the issues of poor quality and serious waste, and are preparing to organize debates to find the reasons and come up with solutions, so as to systematically and thoroughly solve the problems ideologically and institutionally.

### 北京国棉三厂职工展开专题鸣放  猛攻各种浪费现象

    坚决反对浪费　坚持勤俭建国
    北京国棉三厂职工展开专题鸣放
    猛攻各种浪费现象
    据新华社10日讯　国营北京第三棉纺织厂职工最近在“提高质量反对浪费”的专题鸣放中，揭发了厂内各方面惊人的浪费现象，一年来仅产品质量低劣和机物料、原材料积压两项所造成的浪费即达二十多万元。
    这个工厂在仓库里积压了一年之久的机物料和原材料有十一种之多，价值十三万三千多元。吊综绳全厂每月只消耗一公斤多，而仓库积压的足够用十八年之久。因计划不周，只买来了水泵，没买来锅炉，结果水泵不能用，积压浪费两万九千多元。职工们最不满意的是，仓库里积压着两千五百多个月经带，因为天长日久，有的已经变质，这一项合人民币一千三百多元。工人们愤慨地说：月经带本来都是工人自备，公家为什么买这么多积压起来？这是谁的责任？心痛不心痛？
    这个厂生产中用的原棉质量好，织布用纱量也大，但是织出来的布质量却很低，去年9、10、11三个月就因此造成八万多元的损失。计划科人员根据去年这三个月的生产情况算了三笔账：一、三个月全厂实际用纱量比全国先进指标多用七千九百零一公斤，这一项合两万五千九百多元。如果把这些纱织成布，可织成五万八千八百三十一公尺，可供一万一千七百六十六人每人作一套衣服。二、因为纱、布的质量不好，就拼命用好棉，结果使成本大大提高，三个月损失三万九千元。三、三个月所生产的三十四万五千八百七十二匹布中，次布就有三万五千八百一十七匹，这些次布不得不低价出售，国家因而少收入二万二千二百多元。
    职工们揭发：因为生产管理不善，制度不健全，也造成了很大浪费。如整理车间不严格执行每匹布长度四十公尺零二十二公分的规定，很多工人擅自增加长度，市布每匹增加到四十公尺零三十八公分，细平布增加到四十公尺零四十一公分。长度增加的结果，去年三个月中就白白送出了一万三千九百七十三公尺布，损失两万四千八百多元。
    职工们还揭发了领导干部在生活上讲排场所造成的浪费。工厂会议室红灯芯绒靠背的木椅子，本来结实耐用，也朴素美观，但是厂的领导人却认为不好，大笔一挥，就叫采购人员买了六十五把皮椅子，浪费一千五百多元。很多人说，厂长为什么拿着国家的钱这么慷慨？
    各方面的浪费现象被揭发出来以后，使这个工厂的领导人和全厂职工大吃一惊，受到了一次最生动的关于勤俭办企业、爱护国家财产的教育。现在，厂的领导方面正在进一步发动职工对质量不好、浪费严重的问题继续进行鸣放，并且准备组织辩论，找原因，想办法，以便从思想上、从制度上系统地彻底地解决问题。
