    Congratulations on Going to the Countryside
    Wu Boxiao
    Going up to the mountains and down to the countryside for comprehensive training is the resounding call of the motherland. Congratulations, brave warriors, the first to step onto the frontline of labor. This isn't visiting a strange place as a guest, it's being the master of our own rivers and mountains; working and living alongside uncles, brothers, and sisters. This isn't a farewell, it's a reunion, using diligent hands, using plows and hoes, to write rich and magnificent poems on the vast and deep land. Labor is like a crucible, a crucible that can refine pure gold; legend has it that the Old Lord's furnace can forge copper tendons and iron bones. Labor is like sunshine, in sunshine all things flourish and grow; flowers in greenhouses are too delicate, only wind and sun can make people strong. Shake off the dust brought by old clothes, put on a new outfit, a new spirit; take the burden of the times from the shoulders of predecessors, and bravely advance on the road to happiness. Let the cities and countryside be connected by roads, let mental and physical labor blend harmoniously, let workers and peasants hold hands even tighter, and let 600 million people bathe in the socialist spring breeze. A feather sent from afar is a small gift, please don't mind the shortness of the poem, congratulations, comrades who are used to swords and pens, may everyone become skilled laborers, and become excellent members of the cooperative.

    祝贺下乡
    吴伯箫上山下乡，全面锻炼，这是祖国响亮的召唤。祝贺啊，勇敢的战士，第一批走上劳动的前线。这不是到陌生的地方作客，这是作自家河山的主人；跟伯叔、兄弟、姊妹，一道儿劳动，一道儿生活。这不是分手，这是团圆，用勤劳的双手，用犁和锄，在辽阔深厚的土地上，写下丰饶的绚丽的诗篇。劳动比就是熔炉，熔炉里能够炼出纯金；传说在老君炉里能炼就铜筋铁骨。劳动比就是阳光，阳光里万物发荣滋长；温室里的花太娇弱，风吹日晒人才会健壮。拍掉旧日衣衫带来的灰尘，换一套新的装束，新的精神；从前辈肩上接过时代的担子，在通往幸福的路上奋勇前进。让城市跟乡村路路相通，让脑力跟体力水乳交融，让工人跟农民手拉得更紧，让六万万人沐浴社会主义春风。千里送鹅毛，请不要嫌诗短，祝贺啊，拿惯剑和笔的同志们，愿大家都成为劳动的能手，都成为优秀的合作社的社员。
