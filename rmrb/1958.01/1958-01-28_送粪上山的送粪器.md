Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 26th. Zhao Boqin, the Party Secretary of Tal Township in Datong County, Qinghai Province, and Ma Hailimu (Hui), the Director of the Liberation Agricultural Cooperative, collaborated to manufacture a pulley-based manure conveyor for sending manure up the mountain.

The manure conveyor involves erecting two large wooden posts at the top and bottom of the mountain. Thick iron wires are tightly fastened to the posts, and two pulleys are attached to the wires. Two baskets are hung on the pulleys, circulating to transport manure up the mountain and transport soil down the mountain for terrace construction. In the future, it can also be used to transport seeds and bundles during sowing and harvesting.

This manure conveyor only cost 90 yuan in materials and can be adjusted according to the terrain's elevation and distance. It requires five people to operate, but it is equivalent to the workload of fifty people. The Liberation Cooperative has more than 600 mu of land on steep and narrow mountains, where transporting manure was previously very difficult. Now, using the manure conveyor makes it very convenient.

    送粪上山的送粪器
    新华社西宁26日电　青海省大通县塔尔乡党委书记赵伯琴和解放农业社主任马亥力木（回）合作制造了滑轮送粪器，用来送粪上山。
    送粪器是在山顶和山脚各树两个大木椿，椿上紧拴粗铁丝，铁丝上系两个滑轮，挂上两个筐子，循环着把粪送上山和把修梯田的土运下山。将来播种及收割时还可以运送籽种和捆子。
    这个送粪器只用了九十元材料费，可以随地势高低远近调整。它需要五个人操作，但相当于五十个人的工作量。解放社有六百多亩地在坡陡路窄的山上，以前送粪很困难，现在用送粪器送粪，就很方便。
