Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The United States' plot to intensify atomic war preparations in the Middle East by exploiting the Baghdad Pact meeting has provoked strong opposition from the people of Middle Eastern countries.

    Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on the 27th, commenting on the Baghdad Pact Ankara meeting, that any conspiracy against Syria or Egypt will be met with staunch Arab resistance and is destined to meet the same failure as all past imperialist conspiracies.

    "Al-Shaab" (People's) newspaper said on the 28th that the Baghdad Pact countries are "holding secret meetings under police protection, engaging in plots that violate the interests of their own people and all mankind."

    The newspaper said that the reason they are holding secret talks is because they fear their own people, who recognize the dangers being plotted against them. The newspaper said that the bomb explosion at the US Embassy in Ankara on the 27th and the recent warnings by Iraqi parliamentarians against the Baghdad Pact are both expressions of the people of these two countries' dissatisfaction with the treaty.

    Today's editorial in "Al-Khabar" (News) said that the purpose of the Baghdad Pact meeting is only to discuss "war, atomic bombs, missiles, military and economic aid." It said: "Wherever imperialism exists, there will be slaughter and incessant struggle."

    The newspaper warned that the Arab people do not recognize the right of the participants in the Ankara meeting to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs.

    Ihtiyar, a commentator for Damascus Radio in Syria, pointed out on the 27th that US Secretary of State Dulles's participation in the Baghdad Pact Ankara meeting means that "the United States has moved from behind-the-scenes activities to open activities," with the aim of realizing its direct leadership of the Baghdad Pact.

    The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Anbaa" (Information) wrote in a commentary on the opening of the Baghdad Pact Council meeting: The Ankara meeting, like the NATO Council meeting held in Paris, aims to set up and establish atomic and rocket bases within the territory of the Baghdad Pact participating countries, intensify international tension, consolidate the positions of American oil monopoly groups, attempt to integrate the Baghdad Pact with NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and plan to drag Lebanon and Jordan into the Baghdad Pact.

    The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union's position reflects the desire of the Arab people and the people of Middle Eastern countries not to establish atomic weapons and rocket weapons bases on their own territory.

    中东舆论抨击巴格达集团会议
    强烈反对美国在中东玩火
    叙总理指出阿拉伯人将坚决抵抗一切新阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国利用巴格达条约会议加紧在中东进行原子备战的阴谋，引起了中东各国人民的强烈反对。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利27日在评论巴格达条约安卡拉会议时说，任何反对叙利亚或埃及的阴谋将遭到阿拉伯人的坚强抵抗，注定要遭到同过去帝国主义的种种阴谋同样的失败。
    “人民报”28日说，巴格达条约国家“正在警察保护下举行秘密会议，进行违反它们本国人民和全人类利益的谋划”。
    这家报纸说，它们所以要秘密进行会谈，是由于它们畏惧自己的人民，人民认识到正在策划中的对它们的危险。报纸说，27日在安卡拉美国大使馆的炸弹爆炸事件和伊拉克议员最近对巴格达条约的警告都是这两个国家人民对这个条约不满的表示。
    “消息报”今天的社论说，巴格达条约会议的目的只在于讨论“战争、原子弹、导弹、军事和经济援助”。它说：“凡是有帝国主义存在的地方，就会有屠杀和减少不了的斗争。”
    这家报纸警告说，阿拉伯人民不承认安卡拉会议的参加者有权干涉中东事务。
    叙利亚大马士革电台广播评论员伊赫提尔27日指出，美国国务卿杜勒斯参加巴格达条约安卡拉会议，意味着“美国已经从幕后活动转为公开活动”，其目的是要实现它对巴格达条约的直接领导。
    黎巴嫩“消息报”在评论巴格达条约理事会会议开幕时写道：安卡拉会议和在巴黎召开的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议一样，其目的是在巴格达条约参加国境内设置和建立原子基地和火箭基地，加剧国际紧张局势，巩固美国石油垄断集团的阵地，企图把巴格达条约同北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织纠合在一起，并且计划把黎巴嫩和约旦拉进巴格达条约。
    这家报纸指出，苏联的立场反映了阿拉伯人和中东各国人民希望不要在本国境内建立原子武器和火箭武器基地的愿望。
