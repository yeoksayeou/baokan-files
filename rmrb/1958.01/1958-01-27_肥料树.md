    Fertilizer Tree
    In the deep mountains of the Ma Lichang area of Huayuan County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, a fertilizer tree with very high fertilizer efficiency has been discovered.
    This tree, called "Tu Nai" by the local Miao people, is a clump-forming shrub, shaped like a tea-oil tree. The leaves are broad, green and thick, and are the most effective part for fertilizer. Sowing or transplanting can be done every winter and spring, and fertilizer can be harvested in one year. If it grows for two or three years, each tree can produce two to three dan of fertilizer, and it can be harvested and cut three times a year. Wherever "Tu Nai" grows, the surrounding soil is loose and black, and wild grasses and miscellaneous trees grow particularly luxuriantly. In the past, Miao farmers used to pick "Tu Nai" leaves or cut branches and apply them to rice fields, and the soil was also loose and black, increasing grain production by about 20% to 30% per mu.
    The Autonomous Prefecture is preparing to send technical cadres to investigate and study, so as to promote it universally throughout the prefecture.

    肥料树
    在湘西土家族苗族自治州花垣县麻里场一带深山里，发现一种肥效很高的肥料树。
    这种树当地苗族人称为“图耐”，是丛生灌木，形状像油茶树。树叶阔而青厚，是肥效最高的部分。每年冬天、春天都可以播种或移植，一年就能采肥，如果长到两三年后，每蔸树能产肥两三担，一年可以采、砍三次。凡是生长“图耐”的土壤，四周都蓬松污黑，野草杂木长得特别茂盛。过去，苗族农民曾采下“图耐”树叶或砍下树枝施放在稻田里，泥土亦蓬松呈黑色，每亩约能增产粮食20％到30％。
    自治州准备派技术干部前去调查研究，以便在全州普遍推广。
