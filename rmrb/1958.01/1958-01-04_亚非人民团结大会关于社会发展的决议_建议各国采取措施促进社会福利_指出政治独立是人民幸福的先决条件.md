The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference Resolution on Social Development

Suggests Countries Take Measures to Promote Social Welfare

Points out that Political Independence is a Prerequisite for People's Happiness

Preface:

Colonialism and imperialism, in all their forms, have deprived men and women, as creative members of society, of their dignity, exploited the people's energy to achieve their imperialist goals, and exploited the labor of male and female workers to advance their own civilization.

Suppression, massacres, racial discrimination, and deprivation of social rights have become the hallmarks of colonial policy. The ultimate result of this policy is the destruction of the foundations of social structure and national unity.

Serious efforts to achieve social progress can never be separated from the persistent and unwavering struggle for political independence and self-determination. Therefore, all social welfare plans are inevitably closely linked to complete liberation from all kinds of imperialist pressures. Recent liberation movements have demonstrated that only when people fully realize that their efforts will benefit themselves, rather than oppressive countries from the outside or internal exploiting agents, can the creative and constructive forces of the country be liberated.

A fundamental principle is that all economic and social development should have the welfare and prosperity of the people as its ultimate goal. It should seek to develop individual capabilities and fully mobilize the material and spiritual strength of men and women to guide society towards continuous and complete development.

In accordance with the above principles, the Conference makes the following recommendations on the following three issues:

I. Women and Child Welfare; II. Youth Welfare; III. Medical and Social Services.

I. Women and Child Welfare

This Conference, considering that imperialism has hindered and continues to hinder the welfare of the family, which is the primary foundation of society and an important social component, resulting in the weakening and often the disintegration of this structure;

Considering that under colonial rule, or in countries that have suffered colonial fate, women and children have been deprived of social rights to varying degrees and subjected to various forms of exploitation;

Considering that promoting the welfare of women, children, and the entire family is one of the important responsibilities of the state;

Recommends:

(I) The state should enact and implement laws that are necessary to adequately guarantee the family as a component of society, enhance the dignity of motherhood, and ensure the welfare of children. These laws are:

A. The minimum marriage age for women should be set at eighteen years.

B. Marriage should be based on the principle of free personal choice of spouse.

C. Marriage counseling and family planning agencies should be established to conduct health check-ups and provide advice on marriage issues to young men and women.

D. Divorce should be handled and supervised with consideration of the family as a constituent institution of society.

E. Decisive measures should be taken to abolish polygamy or polyandry.

F. In the event of divorce, the mother should have the right to care for the children until they reach an appropriate age.

(II) The state should provide equal opportunities for both sexes in the following areas:

A. Equal voting rights.

B. Legal rights.

C. Labor.

D. Employment in state organs.

(VII) Maternal and child health centers and adequate recreational facilities must be provided and expanded throughout the country as extremely important measures to improve health conditions.

(VIII) Protecting children and shielding them from conditions that may lead them to crime is an important duty of the state. Orphanages, reformatories, and other institutions should be established to educate unfortunate and defective children so that they become productive members of society.

(IX) Considers that juvenile courts with female magistrates are necessary for reforming and dealing with juvenile offenders.

(X) Steps should be taken to provide adequate livelihoods for all members of society in order to eliminate prostitution.

The Conference instructs the Secretariat:

II. Youth Welfare

The Conference

Considering that today's youth are the people the country will rely on tomorrow;

Considering that if the youth are weak and corrupt, it will affect the present and future of the country and may lead to the ultimate degradation of the country; conversely, if the youth are strong physically, intellectually, socially, and morally, the strength and unity of the country will be guaranteed;

Considering that one of the major goals of youth welfare is to cultivate and inspire a sense of civic responsibility and to provide the comprehensive education needed for the benefit of individuals and the entire country;

Considering that civic education is the foundation for the comprehensive cultivation of upright citizens;

Considering that proper attention should be paid to the ways and means of formulating and implementing necessary civic education programs;

Considering that more appropriate ways should be found to strengthen solidarity and mutual understanding among Afro-Asian youth;

Recommends:

(I) Youth should be educated in the spirit of solidarity, friendship, patriotism, peace, and respect for human rights.

(II) The various needs of youth should be studied to help them make better use of their leisure time, and necessary legal measures should be enacted to provide security and welfare for youth.

(III) A comprehensive policy on youth welfare in sports and social education should be formulated, and the various needs of youth should be taken into account.

(IV) Plans to implement this policy should be carefully executed.

(V) The leaders who implement these plans should be trained, and the necessary plans to train these leaders should be formulated.

(VI) For the social welfare of youth, camping, travel, and other outdoor education activities should be organized.

(VII) Sports and recreation centers, clubs, and other institutions should be established to promote the welfare of youth and provide guidance to them.

(VIII) Sufficient funding should be allocated from the budget to achieve the above objectives, which are considered necessary for cultivating good citizens.

(IX) Necessary legal measures should be enacted to protect youth from the influence of immoral publications or films.

(X) Audio-visual tools such as films, slides, and publications should be produced to enhance the welfare of youth in Afro-Asian countries.

B. Promote and support sports and mutual visits of sports teams.

C. Organize Afro-Asian Youth Conferences.

D. Provide all possible assistance to Afro-Asian youth when they stay in any Afro-Asian country.

G. Promote the establishment of an All-Afro-Asian Youth Union.

III. Medical and Social Services

The Conference

Considering that providing a reasonable standard of living for all citizens is the primary responsibility of the state;

Considering that this should be achieved through a comprehensive planning system that combines economic plans for production with plans for social welfare;

Considering that a balance must be established between economic production and social services in accordance with a careful scientific analysis of the needs, resources, and potential of the country;

Considering that any broad national development plan must in any case include facilities for social, educational, health, and housing services as an integral part of the entire plan;

Recommends:

(I) Access to social, educational, health, and housing services is one of the inalienable rights of individuals. These service facilities must be of sufficient quantity and quality to ensure fair distribution and technical efficiency.

(II) Countries should take all necessary steps to better guarantee the current and future security of citizens and their families. This can be achieved through legal measures for social insurance and social relief for the elderly, the disabled, the sick, and all other kinds of the poor.

(III) Since education is one of the most important means of enlightening society and promoting economic progress, the right of individuals to education should be recognized. The state must enact the necessary laws to ensure that all children receive compulsory (primary) education, as well as all the resulting provisions sufficient to enable the state's obligations to be fulfilled. The principle of equal educational opportunities for all, regardless of race, religion, creed, or economic capacity, and the measures involved in all its aspects must be effectively implemented. A nationwide organized movement to eliminate illiteracy among adults must be launched to educate citizens.

(IV) Access to health services is one of the rights to which everyone is entitled. This can be achieved through an entire health plan. The plan includes the following two main aspects:

A. Public health, including the supply of clean water, sanitary housing, and garbage disposal, etc., as well as the supply of medicines for the prevention of endemic and infectious diseases; and to inspire awareness of hygiene and conduct hygiene education, especially in rural areas.

B. Medical aspects, including the convenience of hospitalization and various facilities for clinics and training technicians at all levels. The medical plan can be achieved through health insurance plans or public medical care.

(V) In view of the tragic situation of Palestinian refugees who have been driven out of their homes, the Conference calls on Afro-Asian countries to provide them with material and social assistance to fully demonstrate the shared destiny of these countries until the Palestinian issue is finally resolved.

(VI) It is also urgently necessary for all Afro-Asian countries to provide material and social assistance to alleviate the suffering of the Algerians in their heroic struggle against French imperialism.

(VII) Since hundreds of Cypriots have been deprived of their basic social rights and confined in concentration camps and prisons, the Conference condemns this atrocity of British imperialism and calls on all Afro-Asian peoples to provide moral and material support by all possible means.

The Conference instructs the Secretariat to study and take the necessary steps, when it deems possible, to establish a permanent body for medical, pharmaceutical, and social service undertakings in Afro-Asian countries in order to promote continuous cooperation between these countries in medicine, scientific and technological discoveries, and social services. This body will also be responsible for organizing conferences and seminars to exchange experiences and for coordinating medical and social service undertakings in times of crisis and emergency.

This body, in cooperation with other Afro-Asian organizations, may also engage in the coordinated planning of the pharmaceutical industry. Such coordinated planning will help these countries achieve a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the near future, enabling them to rely on themselves and promote mutual trade exchange in medical supplies.

    亚非人民团结大会关于社会发展的决议
    建议各国采取措施促进社会福利
    指出政治独立是人民幸福的先决条件
    序言：
    以各种形式出现的殖民主义和帝国主义剥夺了作为社会中有创造能力的社会成员的男女个人的尊严，榨取人民的精力来达到他们的帝国主义目的，并且剥削男女劳动人民的劳动来增进它们自己的文明。
    镇压、大规模屠杀、种族歧视和剥夺社会权利已经成了殖民政策的标志。这种政策的最后结果是破坏社会结构和民族团结的基础。
    争取社会进步的认真努力决不能同争取政治独立和自决的持久的和坚持不渝的斗争分开。因此，一切社会福利的计划不可避免地要同从各种各样的帝国主义压力下获得完全解放紧密联系在一起。最近的解放运动已经证明，只有当人民充分认识到他们的努力能使他们自己得到好处、而不是让从外界进行压迫的国家或内部的剥削代理者得到好处的时候，才能解放国家的创造性和建设性的力量。
    一切经济和社会发展应该以人民的福利和繁荣为最终目的，这是一条基本原则。它应该谋求发展个人的能力，和充分动员男男女女的物质和精神力量，以引导社会向不断的、完整的发展方面前进。
    按照上述原则，大会就下面三个问题提出如下建议：
    一、妇女和儿童福利；二、青年福利；三、医疗和社会服务。
    一、妇女和儿童福利
    这次大会考虑到帝国主义过去妨害了而且继续在妨害家庭的福利，而家庭是社会的主要基础和重要的社会组成部分，结果是削弱，并且常常是瓦解这种结构；
    考虑到在殖民统治下，或者在曾经遭到殖民地命运的国家里，妇女和儿童在不同程度上被剥夺了社会权利，并且遭到各式各样的剥削；

    甲、女子最低限度的结婚年龄应该规定为十八岁。
    乙、婚姻应该建立在个人自由选择配偶的原则的基础上。
    丙、应该建立婚姻谘询和计划生育的机构，以便进行健康检查，并且对男女青年提供关于婚姻问题的建议。

    二、青年福利
    大会
    考虑到今天的青年是国家明天将依靠的人；
    考虑到如果青年孱弱和腐化，将对国家的现在和将来产生影响，并且可能导致国家最后的败坏；反过来说，如果青年在体质上、智力上、社会关系上和道德上都很强，国家的力量和团结就将得到保障；

      （十二）应当建立一个隶属于亚非人民团结理事会常设秘书处的临时的青年福利机构，以便：
    甲、鼓励发展亚非青年之间的文化联系。
    乙、促进和支持体育运动以及体育队的相互访问。
    丙、组织亚非青年会议。
    丁、当亚非国家青年在任何亚非国家停留时给予一切可能的帮助。
    戊、促进在一切亚非国家中建立青年组织。
    己、支持并且鼓励举行定期的亚非国家青年联欢节的主张。
    庚、促进全亚非青年联盟的成立。
    三、医疗及社会服务
    大会
    考虑到为全体公民提供合理的生活标准是国家的主要责任；
    考虑到这应该通过一个把关于生产的经济计划同社会福利事业的计划结合起来的全盘计划制度来加以实现；
    考虑到必须按照对国家的需要、资源和潜力所进行的仔细的科学分析而在经济生产和社会服务这两个方面之间建立平衡；
    考虑到任何广泛的国家发展计划在任何情况下都必须包括社会、教育、卫生和房屋方面的服务的设施，作为整个计划中不可分割的一部分；
    建议：
    （一）享受社会、教育、卫生和房屋方面的服务是个人的不可剥夺的权利之一。这些服务设施必须有足够的数量和质量以便保证公正分配和技术上的效率。
    （二）各国应该采取一切必要的步骤来使公民本人和他的家庭在目前和将来的安全得到更好的保证。这可以通过对老人、残废者、病人和所有其他种类的穷人的社会保险和社会救济的法律措施来实现。
    （三）由于教育是使社会开明和经济进步的最重要的手段之一，个人受教育的权利应该得到承认。国家必须制订让所有的儿童都受到义务（初级）教育的必要的法律，以及足以使国家的义务得到履行的一切由之而来的规定。不管种族、宗教、教派或经济能力如何，所有的人受教育机会均等的原则和它所牵涉到的各方面的措施必须有效地加以实施。必须发动全国性的扫除成人中的文盲的有组织的运动来教育公民。
    （四）享有卫生服务是每个人应有的权利之一。这可以通过整个卫生计划来实现。计划包括以下两个主要方面：
    甲、公共卫生，包括供应清洁的水、卫生的房屋和清除垃圾等，以及供应预防地方病和传染病的药品；并且要启发注意卫生的自觉和进行卫生教育，特别是在农村地区。
    乙、医疗方面，包括住院的便利以及诊疗所和训练各级技术人员的各种设备。医疗计划可以通过健康保险计划或公费医疗来实现。
    （五）鉴于被赶出自己家乡的巴勒斯坦难民的悲惨情况，大会要求亚非国家给予他们物质援助和社会援助，以充分表明这些国家的休戚相关，直到巴勒斯坦问题最后得到解决为止。
    （六）还迫切需要一切亚非国家提供物质和社会援助来减轻阿尔及利亚人在他们反对法帝国主义的英雄斗争中所遭到的苦难。
    （七）由于成百的塞浦路斯人被剥夺了他们的基本社会权利，关在集中营和监狱中，大会谴责英帝国主义的这种暴行，并且要求一切亚非人民用一切可能的办法给予道义上的和物质上的支持。
    大会指示秘书处在它认为可能的时候研究并采取必要的步骤为亚非国家设立一个负责医疗、制药和社会服务事业的常设机构，以促进这些国家在医药、科学和技术发现以及社会服务方面的不断的合作。这个机构还将负责组织会议和讨论会以交流经验，并且在发生危机和紧急状况时负责统筹安排医药和社会服务事业方面的工作。
    这个机构在同其他亚非组织的合作下也可以从事医药工业的统筹安排工作。这种统筹安排将帮助这些国家在最近的将来达到某种程度的自给自足，使它们能够自己靠自己，并且促进相互间医疗用品的贸易交流。
