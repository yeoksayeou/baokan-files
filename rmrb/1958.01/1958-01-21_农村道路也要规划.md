    Rural Roads Also Need Planning
    Based on investigations in Gaojiazhuang, Zhaobuxinzhuang, and Buli villages in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, after the cooperativization movement, village and commune cadres relaxed management of rural roads, and the masses did not cherish public property. This resulted in an increase in rural roads compared to before. Some small paths became main roads, and main roads widened. Counting only the eleven newly added roads, large and small, in the above three villages, more than 36 mu of land were occupied. There were also nine unnecessary roads, occupying 34 mu, totaling more than 70 mu of land. At a yield of 200 jin of grain per mu, this represents a loss of 14,000 jin of grain. Based on 168 villages in Gaoyang County, if rural roads were planned in a unified way, and unnecessary roads were eliminated through consultation with the masses and neighboring villages, the cultivated area could be expanded by more than 3,900 mu, and grain production could be increased by more than 780,000 jin. Therefore, the issue of unified road planning is very worthy of attention. Gaoyang County is currently instructing all agricultural cooperatives to carry out road planning in conjunction with production planning. However, I believe that similar situations may exist in other places. Therefore, I suggest that all localities conduct a check, and in conjunction with current production planning, unify road planning under the principle of not affecting traffic and agricultural operations, which is very necessary. At the same time, through this work, the masses should be educated to love the commune and cherish public property, making them aware of how much cultivated land area will be lost if they only consider saving themselves a few steps.

### 农村道路也要规划

    农村道路也要规划
    根据河北高阳县高家庄、赵布辛庄、布里三个村的调查，合作化以后，由于村社干部对农村道路放松了管理，群众对公共财物不爱护，致使农村道路比以前增了许多。有的小路走成了大道，大道又增宽了。仅以上三个村新增的大小道十一条计算，占地三十六亩多；还有九条不必要的道路，占地三十四亩，共计占地七十多亩。以每亩产粮二百斤计算，即损失粮食一万四千斤。按高阳县一百六十八个村计算，如将农村道路统一规划一下，通过与群众及邻村的协商，将不必要的道路取消，就可以扩大耕地面积三千九百多亩，可增收粮食七十八万多斤。所以统一规划道路的问题，是很值得注意的。高阳县目前正指示各农业社结合生产规划进行道路规划。但是，我想类似情况在其它地方也可能存在，因此，建议各地进行一次检查，同时结合当前生产规划，在不影响交通及农业操作的原则下，统一规划一下道路是很必要的。同时通过这一工作，应向群众进行一次爱社、爱护公共财物的教育，使他们知道只顾自己少走几步路会要损失多少耕地面积。
