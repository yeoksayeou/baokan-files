On Welcoming and Sending Off Cadres Being Sent Down
	Mei Ersan

That a large number of cadres go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to participate in physical labor is a good thing, a major thing. This is not only a matter for some cadres being sent down, but also a matter for all cadres; this is not only a matter for all cadres, but also a matter for all the people of the country. Because doing so can train our cadre ranks into a cadre force that is loyal to the cause of communism and can withstand risks.

It is absolutely necessary to conduct a vivid and concrete socialist education for cadres and the people through this matter. Therefore, all regions should publicize this matter, and should publicize it vigorously. Hold cadre meetings, hold mass meetings, hold broadcast meetings, and use various forms to publicize it, so that it is known to every household.

However, it must also be done appropriately, especially in accordance with the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, and it must be both grand and simple. Some places' propaganda, although vigorously carried out, does not quite conform to the principle of diligence and thrift. According to reports in various newspapers, Nanchang, Jiangxi, once held a farewell meeting of more than 100,000 people, and Zhengzhou, Henan, also held a grand farewell meeting of 70,000 people. Taiyuan City, Shanxi, organized a grand parade, with 300,000 people lining the streets to welcome and see them off. Xining City, Qinghai, had 150,000 people to see them off. What a scene of bustling crowds and deafening gongs and drums! Although this approach greatly encourages cadres and the people, it excessively wastes the time and energy of cadres and the people. Take Qinghai as an example. The entire population of Xining is more than 280,000 (according to 1955 statistics), and this time the sending off of cadres being sent down mobilized more than half of the population. And not only that, these cadres being sent down continued to receive excessive welcomes when they arrived in various places. Those who arrived in Huangyuan County were welcomed by more than 10,000 local people, and those who arrived in Huzhu County were also welcomed by more than 10,000 people. This kind of welcome continued all the way to the township and the commune. These areas have not yet let the cadres being sent down participate in labor, but have already wasted many workdays for the masses. Taking the welcome in Huangyuan County as an example, the number of cadres sent down to this county is forty-seven. If each person works an average of 250 workdays a year, it will be just over 10,000 workdays, but the workdays spent on this welcome are probably several thousand.

Is it that without holding large farewell meetings, without erecting decorated archways, without setting off firecrackers, without wearing flowers and sending flags, and without beating gongs and drums, we cannot carry out vigorous publicity? Can we not achieve the purpose of publicity? No. Holding smaller farewell and welcome meetings, holding various forums, organizing broadcast meetings, and writing articles in newspapers are all vigorous publicity, and all can achieve the purpose of publicity.

Moreover, some units, because they paid too much attention to this large-scale welcoming and sending off, relaxed or even abandoned the necessary ideological work. As a result, many ideological problems that could be solved were not solved in time.

From the current situation, the most important thing we need to pay attention to in this work is not over-large welcomes and farewells, but meticulous political and ideological work.

    谈欢送和欢迎下放干部
    梅而三
    大批干部上山下乡参加体力劳动，是件好事，是件大事。这不仅仅是部分下放干部的事情，也是所有干部的事情；这也不仅仅是所有干部的事情，也是全国人民的事情。因为这样做，可以把我们的干部队伍锻炼成一支忠诚为共产主义事业奋斗的、经得起风险的干部队伍。
    通过这件事情，对干部对人民进行一次生动具体的社会主义教育，是完全必要的。因此，各地都应该来宣传这件事情，并且要大张旗鼓地来宣传这件事情。开干部大会，开群众大会，开广播大会，用各种各样的形式进行宣传，作到家喻户晓。
    但是也要作得恰当，特别要符合勤俭建国的方针，要作到既要隆重，又要朴素。现在有些地方的宣传，虽然作到了大张旗鼓，但是不大符合勤俭的原则。据各地报纸报道，江西南昌曾举行十万余人的欢送大会，河南郑州也举行了七万人的盛大欢送大会，山西太原市组织了大游行，沿途有三十万人民夹道欢送，青海西宁市有十五万人欢送。真是人山人海，锣鼓喧天，好不热闹！这种作法虽然对干部对人民有很大的鼓舞，但是过分地浪费了干部和人民的时间和精力。以青海为例。西宁全市人口二十八万多（根据1955年统计），这次欢送下放干部就发动了一半多人口。还不仅仅如此，这些下放干部到各地时，还继续受到过分地欢迎。到达湟源县的，又受到当地一万多人的欢迎，到达互助县的，也受到一万多人的欢迎，这种欢迎一直继续到乡到社。这些地区还没有让下放干部参加劳动，就让群众浪费了许多劳动日。以湟源县欢迎为例，下放到这个县的干部是四十七名，今年劳动一年，以平均每人二百五十个劳动日来计算，不过一万多个劳动日，而这次欢迎所花去的劳动日，也怕有好几千个。
    是不是不举行大的欢送会，是不是不扎牌楼，是不是不放鞭炮，是不是不戴花送旗，是不是不敲锣打鼓，就不能大张旗鼓的宣传呢？就不能达到宣传的目的呢？不是的。举行规模较小的欢送会和欢迎会，召开各种座谈会，组织广播大会，在报纸上写文章，都是大张旗鼓的宣传，都可以达到宣传的目的。
    而且某些单位因为过分地注意了这种大规模的欢送欢迎，就放松甚或放弃了必要的思想工作。结果，许多可以解决的思想问题没有能够及时解决。
    从目前情况来看，在这件工作上需要我们注意的事情，最主要的不是过大的欢迎欢送，而是细致的政治思想工作。
