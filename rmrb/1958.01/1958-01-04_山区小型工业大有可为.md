    Small-Scale Industry in Mountainous Areas Holds Great Promise
    Wu Lü
    After reading the news about Shaanxi Province developing small and medium-sized industries and processing industries in mountainous areas, I would like to discuss the construction of industry in mountainous regions.
    Mountainous areas account for more than two-thirds of China's land area, and the people living in mountainous areas account for about one-third of China's total population. There is no doubt that building socialism and improving people's lives cannot be done without mountainous areas. Whether or not mountainous areas should build industry, and whether or not they can build industry, should also be beyond doubt. However, in reality, some people always feel that mountainous areas are poor, transportation is inconvenient, and there is a lack of industrial foundation. Therefore, many places have not yet put the development of small-scale industry in mountainous areas on the agenda.
    The example of Shaanxi Province positively educates these doubters.
    Mountainous areas need to build industry. The reason is simple: the people in mountainous areas need industrial products. If there is no industry in mountainous areas, all means of production and consumer goods must be transported from outside, which is expensive, and supply is difficult to be timely. Especially the production and repair of means of production such as agricultural tools, if they cannot be solved locally, it will have a great impact on production in mountainous areas. For the country, developing small and medium-sized industries in mountainous areas, processing the rich industrial raw materials in mountainous areas into finished and semi-finished products for export, and even exporting them, is also very important to change the situation where large quantities of raw materials are difficult to transport out due to the lack of industry in mountainous areas, and many useful resources are ignored. This will increase the income of the country and farmers, and meet the needs of society.
    Can industry be built in mountainous areas? Yes. Mountainous areas are rich in resources, which is the most favorable condition for the development of small and medium-sized industries. The people in mountainous areas need means of production and livelihood, which is the broadest market for industry in mountainous areas. With the advantage of obtaining materials locally and the convenience of selling locally, why can't industry be developed?
    Of course, there are difficulties, and many. Weak industrial base, insufficient technical strength, inconvenient transportation conditions, and so on. However, as long as two ideas are established, all difficulties are not difficult to solve. One is to truly have the drive to build socialism. The other is to develop industry in mountainous areas realistically, starting from the specific conditions of mountainous areas. Do not attempt to move the construction standards of large-scale industry to mountainous areas. Therefore, the scale may be smaller, and the equipment may be older, as long as the machines can be started up as soon as possible, the manpower can be organized, and the treasures of the mountainous areas can be picked up. With such a starting point, difficulties such as insufficient funds, insufficient equipment, and insufficient technical strength can also be easily solved by simple methods.
    After investigation and research, many areas in Shaanxi Province have put forward plans for developing small-scale industry in mountainous areas and have made specific arrangements for construction projects in 1958, so that industry in mountainous areas can also make a leap forward like agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. It is hoped that more areas will put forward plans for developing industry in mountainous areas and put them into action.

    山区小型工业大有可为
    吴滤
    读了陕西省发展山区中、小型工业和加工业的新闻，想谈一谈山区工业的建设。
    山区面积占我国土地面积三分之二以上，生活在山区的人民，占我国人口总数三分之一左右。建设社会主义，改善人民的生活等等，不能撇开山区，这是没有疑问的。山区要不要建设工业，能不能建设工业，这也应该是没有疑问的。但实际上有些人总觉得山区穷，交通不便，缺乏工业基础，因而不少地方还没有把发展山区小型工业放到议事日程上来。
    陕西省的例子从正面教育了这些怀疑论者。
    山区需要建设工业。理由很简单，山区的人民需要工业品。若是山区没有工业，不论任何生产资料、消费资料，都要从外面运去，运费贵，供应也难以及时。特别是农具等生产资料的生产和修理，若是不能就地解决，更会对山区的生产发生很大的影响。对国家说来，在山区发展中、小型工业，把山区富饶的工业原材料就地加工成成品和半成品外运，甚至出口，改变因为山区没有工业，大批原料外运困难，许许多多有用的资源无人问津的情况，增加国家和农民的收入，满足社会的需要，也是十分重要的。
    能不能在山区建设工业呢？能。山区资源丰富，这是发展中、小型工业的最有利的条件。山区人民需要生产资料和生活资料，这是山区工业最广阔的市场。既有就地取材之利，又有就地销售之便，为什么不能发展工业呢？
    当然，困难也是有的，而且还很多。工业基础薄弱、技术力量不足、交通条件不便等等。但是，只要树立了两种思想，一切困难都不难解决。其一是真正有了建设社会主义的干劲。其二是从山区的具体情况出发，实事求是地发展山区的工业，不要企图把大工业的建设标准搬到山区去，因而规模不妨小些，设备不妨旧些，只要能尽快地把机器发动起来，把人力组织起来，把山区的财宝捡起来就行。有了这样的出发点，诸如资金不足、设备不足、技术力量不足等等困难，也就不难用因陋就简的办法得到解决。
    陕西省许多地区经过调查研究之后，已经提出了发展山区小型工业的规划，并具体安排了1958年的建设项目，要使山区的工业也像农业、林业和牧畜业一样，来一个跃进。希望能看到有更多的地区提出发展山区工业的规划，并付之于行动。
