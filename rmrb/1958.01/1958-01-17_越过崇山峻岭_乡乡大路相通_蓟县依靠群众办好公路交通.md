Xinhua News Agency, Baoding: At the Hebei Province Agricultural Bumper Harvest Exhibition's transportation hall, there is a three-dimensional model showing the development of Ji County's highways over the years and the long-term plan for 1967. The guide explained to the audience: Before liberation, only two and a half highways passed through Ji County, with a total length of only 105 kilometers within the territory, and they were bumpy and uneven. From liberation to 1957, the county, relying on the strength of the masses, built more than ten highways, increasing the total length of highways to 288 kilometers, and extending them to high mountains and ridges. The masses also built 182 township and commune roads themselves, with a total length of 391 kilometers. Now, every township in the county is connected by highways, simple roads, or cart and horse roads, becoming a model county for relying on the masses to improve highway transportation nationwide. According to the plan, by 1967, the county will have 602 kilometers of regular highways and 126 kilometers of simple roads.

Ji County is located at the foot of the Great Wall in northeastern Hebei Province. The northern part is a range of undulating mountains and ridges, accounting for 40% of the county's total area; the southern part is a low-lying area, accounting for nearly 25% of the county's total area. Because of poor drainage, the low-lying areas are prone to churning mud, making the roads difficult to travel. The local people are eager to improve transportation conditions to facilitate the smooth exchange of local specialties and other materials.

In 1951, the Ji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principle of "relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and improving transportation," conducted a survey of the county's transportation situation and decided to mobilize the masses to build highways well within three to five years. Every year, the county committee integrates transportation work with other central tasks according to different seasons, and the transportation authorities formulate construction plans and construction schemes. Because this principle and plan conformed to the wishes of the masses, it quickly turned into the actual actions of the masses. From 1951 to the present, the masses have contributed a total of more than 2.04 million labor days and more than 48,300 cart and wheelbarrow days. In addition to repairing existing highways, simple roads, and cart and horse roads, they have also built 202 bridges and culverts on 14 large and small rivers, 103 of which were self-funded and self-built by the masses. In 1956, on the highway from Bangjun to Houpanzhuang, the state invested only 42 yuan, and the masses built a large five-arch stone bridge. The original plan was to use 160 working days for technicians, but later experienced elderly farmers with bridge-building experience were hired as technical instructors, and no technicians were used.

In the process of construction, the enthusiasm of the vast number of migrant workers was very high due to the reasonable solution of the comparative price of road construction labor remuneration and agricultural labor remuneration. The state also saved the expenditure on technician wages by using demonstration, visits, mutual teaching and mutual learning and other methods to help migrant workers quickly learn technology. The masses are also very active in road maintenance, and agricultural cooperatives along the main lines have organized road maintenance teams, with the number of team members increasing from 340 in 1951 to 650 now, ensuring that damage is repaired, snow is swept away after snowfall, and water is drained after rain. Moreover, from 1951 to the present, road maintenance workers have also planted more than 388,000 trees along the highways, greening several main lines into tree-lined avenues.

### 越过崇山峻岭　乡乡大路相通  蓟县依靠群众办好公路交通

    越过崇山峻岭　乡乡大路相通
    蓟县依靠群众办好公路交通
    据新华社保定讯　正在举办的河北省农业丰产展览会的交通馆里，有一个表现蓟县公路几年来的发展情况和1967年远景规划的立体模型。说明员向观众介绍说：解放前，蓟县全境只有两条半公路通过，境内路段共长只一百零五公里，而且坎坷不平。从解放后到1957年，全县依靠群众的力量修建了十多条公路，使公路总长增加到两百八十八公里，并且延伸到了高山峻岭里。群众还自己修了乡、社道路一百八十二条，共长三百九十一公里。现在全县不管那个乡，都有公路、简易公路或车、马大路相通，成了全国依靠群众办好公路交通的模范县。按照规划，到1967年全县将有正规的公路六百零二公里，简易公路一百二十六公里。
    蓟县处在河北省东北部长城脚下，北部是起伏的崇山峻岭，占全县总面积40％；南部是低洼地区，占全县总面积近25％。低洼地区因为排水不良，翻浆严重，道路也很难行。当地人民渴望改善交通条件，使土特产等物资交流畅旺。
    1951年，中共蓟县委员会根据“依靠群众，发动群众，搞好交通”的方针，对全县交通情况作了调查，决定在三、五年内发动群众把公路修建好。县委每年按不同季节将交通工作同其它中心工作统一安排，由交通主管部门制订修建计划和施工方案。由于这个方针和计划符合于群众的愿望，很快就变成了群众的实际行动。从1951年到目前，群众共出人力二百零四万多个劳动日，出大车、手推车四万八千三百多个车日，除修好现有公路、简易公路和车马大路以外，还在十四条大、小河流上修建桥涵二百零二座，其中一百零三座是由群众自筹自建的。1956年在邦均到候盘庄的公路上，国家只投资四十二元，群众就修了一座五孔的大石桥。这个桥原计划用技工一百六十个工作日，后来聘请了有建桥经验的老年农民作技术指导，一个技工也没有用。
    在施工过程中，由于合理解决了筑路劳动报酬和农业劳动报酬的比价，广大民工情绪很高。由于用示范、参观、互教互学等各种方法帮助民工很快学会技术，也给国家节省了技工工资的开支。群众对护路养路也都很积极，各个主要干线沿线的农业社都组织了护路组，组员由1951年的三百四十人增加到现在的六百五十人，做到损坏有人补，雪后有人扫，雨后有人放水。而且，从1951年到现在，护路民工还沿公路栽植了三十八万八千多株树，使几条主要干线绿化成为林荫大道。
