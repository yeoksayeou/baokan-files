Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 8th. The Guangzhou Railway Bureau has emphasized ideological work in the cadre transfer process, ensuring that the vast majority of transferred cadres can happily embark on new labor posts.

The Guangzhou Railway Bureau began mobilizing cadres for transfer in November of last year, and quickly launched a vigorous upsurge of registration and applications to go to the mountains and countryside for road maintenance and coal hauling; those who wrote letters of determination and applications accounted for 94% of all staff. In the face of this upsurge, the bureau's leadership maintained a clear head, and from the beginning put forward the slogan of "Those who stay feel secure, those who leave feel happy." They conducted a thorough investigation and specific analysis of the thinking of the cadres who signed up for transfer, and found that among the 1,304 people who signed up, only 596 resolutely demanded transfer, while the rest still had more or less ideological problems that had not been truly resolved. Therefore, they decided to do in-depth ideological work, adopting methods such as large group or small group discussions, leadership talks, and individual heart-to-heart talks, to allow cadres to express their difficulties, talk about their aspirations, and speak their minds.

Through discussions, many real ideological situations were revealed. One Party member cadre talked about his thinking, believing that he came from a rural family, had participated in labor when he was studying, and no longer needed training; he had expertise, and going down would be a waste; he could do all the work in the department, and did not need to be transferred. Everyone sincerely helped him analyze the situation, pointing out that although he had participated in labor in the past, he mainly lived a school life and received bourgeois education, so it was still necessary to carry out labor training; he was engaged in statistical work, which was not a special expertise, and only by going to the countryside for training could his position and views be more firm and clear. After everyone's help, the Party branch committee also had an individual talk with him, further helping him to raise his ideological understanding, and finally he happily embarked on the labor front.

A technician in this bureau, Zhang Juesheng, also wrote an application and guarantee in the upsurge of applying to go to the mountains and countryside, but when he was approved to go to the countryside as a road maintenance worker, he asked to go to the vehicle repair department, saying that he would resolutely not go as a road maintenance worker. Leading cadres and everyone talked to him many times, but it didn't work, so he was left behind. After seeing off the first batch of transferred cadres, the energetic spirit and sense of honor of the transferred cadres gave him great inspiration. He once again asked to be transferred, and guaranteed to overcome all difficulties, earnestly transform himself, and make contributions on the labor front.

In order to establish the idea of labor being glorious and the need to obey socialist construction among cadres, the Guangzhou Railway Bureau also organized veteran workers to talk about their experiences in labor, and organized everyone to discuss their experiences in studying documents, so that all cadres further realized that what intellectuals lose after participating in labor will be non-proletarian ideological consciousness, and what they gain will be deep feelings for the working people and the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and courage of cadres to participate in labor.

In addition to conducting individual talks with each transferred cadre, the leading cadres of this bureau also visited the cadres' families and held family forums. Many family members enthusiastically encouraged their relatives to go to the labor front. The Railway Bureau also took many measures to help the transferred cadres solve some difficulties as much as possible. This also played a certain role in strengthening and encouraging the confidence of the transferred cadres.

    广州铁路局思想工作做得好
    下放干部愉快地走上新的劳动岗位
    据新华社广州8日电　广州铁路管理局在干部下放工作中重视做好思想工作，做到绝大部分下放干部都能愉快地走上新的劳动岗位。
    广州铁路管理局从去年11月开始动员干部下放，并且很快就掀起了轰轰烈烈的报名申请上山下乡、养路抬煤的热潮；写决心书和申请书的占全体工作人员的94％。在这个热潮前面，局的领导保持了清醒的头脑，一开始就提出了“留的安心，走的愉快”的口号。他们对报名下放干部的思想进行了摸底和具体分析，发现报名的一千三百零四名人员中，坚决要求下放的只有五百九十六人，其余的人都还有或多或少的思想问题没有真正解决。因此，他们决定深入地做好思想工作，采取了大组或小组漫谈、领导谈话、个别谈心等方法，让干部摆困难，谈志愿，说出心里话。
    经过漫谈，许多真实的思想情况讲出来了。有一个党员干部谈出了自己的思想，他认为自己出身农村家庭，读书时已参加过劳动，不再需要锻炼；自己有专长，下去是浪费；科里一切工作都可以做，不下放也可以。大家诚恳地帮助他作了分析，指出：过去他虽然参加过劳动，但主要是过的学校生活，受的资产阶级教育，还是有必要进行劳动锻炼；他搞的是统计工作，不算特别的专长，下乡经过锻炼，立场、观点才更坚定、明确。经过大家的帮助，党支部委员又找他个别谈话，进一步帮助他提高思想认识，最后他愉快地走上了劳动战线。
    这个局的一个技术员张觉生，在申请上山下乡的热潮中也写了申请书、保证书，但当他被批准下乡当养路工人时，他便要求到车辆修理部门去，说当养路工人就坚决不走。领导干部和大家同他多次谈话，但是不起什么作用，后来就把他留下来。在欢送第一批下放干部之后，下放干部朝气勃勃的精神和光荣感给了他很大启发，他又重新要求下放，并且保证克服一切困难，认真改造自己，在劳动战线上立功。
    广州铁路管理局为了在干部中树立劳动光荣和服从社会主义建设需要的思想，还组织老工人谈劳动的体会，组织大家漫谈学习文件的心得，使全体干部都进一步认识到：知识分子参加劳动后失去的将是非无产阶级的思想意识，得到的将是对劳动人民的深厚感情和无产阶级的立场观点。这样就大大地鼓舞了干部参加劳动的积极性和勇气。
    这个局的领导干部除了同每个下放干部进行个别谈话以外，还访问了干部们的家属，召开了家属座谈会，很多家属都热情地鼓励亲人到劳动战线上去。铁路局还采取很多措施，尽量帮助下放干部解决一些困难。这对坚定和鼓舞下放干部的信心，也起了一定作用。
