Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 26th: U.S. Senator Green, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democratic Senator, admitted in a report on the 25th that due to internal contradictions and difficulties within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, many countries in this bloc have not completed the military expansion plans expected by the United States. He clamored that the United States must further spur these countries to step up their military expansion and war preparations.

Green submitted this report to Congress after visiting various member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last fall. He said that in his investigation, he found that "disagreements exist" among member states regarding the question of what policies the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should now implement, and that the military strength of this organization is significantly "lower" than the agreed-upon strength. He said that a series of complex factors have caused this situation, mainly because politicians in these countries are "unwilling to face" the economic problems caused by expanding armaments.

Green said that the government leaders he met had talked about their plans to reduce military spending, reduce troop numbers, shorten compulsory military service, or postpone the modernization of the military, and the reasons they gave for these plans were all budgetary. Some countries also believe that with modern weapons, they can reduce the number of armed forces and cut military budgets. He believes this idea is "absurd."

Green expressed great dissatisfaction with the fact that the public in the member states of the North Atlantic group are unwilling to sacrifice their living standards for the sake of unlimited military expansion. In the tone of an American master, he demanded that the governments of these countries "do more vigorously and bravely" in forcing the people to carry out military expansion and war preparations. He reminded the governments to face the fact that "their military spending in the next few years will cost more money, not less." He emphasized that "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is first and foremost a military alliance," and any non-military activities of this bloc must not "blur" this point.

Green said that West Germany and France are the "key to the success or failure" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Western Europe. When West Germany joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1955, according to the plan, it was to provide twelve divisions within three years and a small number of naval and a large number of air force personnel within four years. But today, West Germany's armed forces are "far from the original target." At the same time, some people in West Germany are dissatisfied with the Western occupation policy, and they have a kind of "anti-militarism sentiment." Green said that the United States must currently accelerate the rearmament of West Germany, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council can discuss this issue with the Bonn government.

Green said that many divisions of the troops that France should have provided to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have now been transferred to Algeria. He said that the Algerian issue affects the "strength" of the North Atlantic group, and he believes that some people in France talking about "making progress in the military" is a "dangerous subjective wish." He said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should express "concern" about the Algerian situation.

Green also said that the Cyprus issue involving Britain, Greece, and Turkey "is greatly weakening the right wing of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is deteriorating the relations between the countries concerned, especially Greece and Turkey." He suggested holding secret negotiations to resolve this issue.

### 美参院外委会主席狂敲备战锣鼓  要大西洋伙伴舍命扩军

    美参院外委会主席狂敲备战锣鼓
    要大西洋伙伴舍命扩军
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会主席、民主党参议员格林25日在一份调查报告中承认，由于北大西洋公约组织的内部矛盾和困难，这个集团的许多国家都没有完成美国所期望的扩军计划。他叫嚷美国必须进一步鞭策这些国家加紧进行扩军备战。
    格林在去年秋季访问北大西洋公约组织各个成员国后向国会提出了这个报告。他说，他在调查中发现各成员国对于北大西洋公约组织现在应当执行什么政策这样一个问题“存在着分歧”，这个组织的军事力量大大“低于”商定的力量。他说，造成这种情况有一系列的复杂因素，而主要是由于这些国家的政界人士“不愿面对”由于扩充军备而引起的经济问题。
    格林说，和他会谈的政府领袖们曾经谈到他们削减军事费用、减少军队、缩短义务兵役期或推迟军队现代化的计划，他们为这些计划提出的理由都是预算方面的。某些国家还认为由于有了现代武器，就可以减少武装部队人数和削减军事预算。他认为这种想法是“荒谬”的。
    格林对于北大西洋集团成员国的各国公众不愿意因无限制地扩张军备而牺牲生活水平这件事表示非常不满。他以美国主子的口吻要求这些国家的政府在迫使人民进行扩军备战工作方面“做得更有力和勇敢些”。他提醒各国政府要正视这样一个事实：“它们今后几年的军事开支是要花更多的钱而不是更少的钱。”他强调：“北大西洋公约组织首先是一个军事同盟”，这个集团的任何非军事方面的活动都决不能“模糊”这一点。
    格林说，西德和法国是北大西洋公约组织在西欧的“成败关键”。当西德在1955年参加北大西洋公约组织的时候，按照计划它是要在三年之内提供十二个师，并且在四年内提供少量的海军和大量的空军的。但是今天，西德的武装力量“比原来确定的目标差得很远”。同时，西德有些人不满西方的占领政策，他们有一种“反对军国主义的情绪”。格林说，美国目前必须加速重新武装西德，关于这个问题可以由北大西洋公约组织理事会同波恩政府讨论。
    格林说，法国本应提供给北大西洋公约组织的部队现在有许多师已经调往阿尔及利亚。他说，阿尔及利亚问题影响北大西洋集团的“力量”，他认为法国某些人谈论“在军事方面会取得进展”，这是“危险的主观愿望”。他说，北大西洋公约组织应当对阿尔及利亚局势表示“关心”。
    格林还说，牵涉英国、希腊和土耳其的塞浦路斯问题“正在大大削减北大西洋公约组织的右翼，并且正在使有关国家、特别是希腊和土耳其的关系恶化”。他建议举行秘密谈判来解决这个问题。
