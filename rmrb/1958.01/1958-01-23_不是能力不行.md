It's Not a Lack of Ability
Huang Deshu

"The rectification campaign is truly like a good medicine, curing many of my old problems." Zhao Jinshan, the section chief of the Transportation Section of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, started by saying this to me.

What were some of his old problems? The workers raised a total of fifty-eight opinions about him during the rectification campaign. Some said, "The nine-ton crane is only missing one herringbone gear, but it hasn't been repaired for months. How are you leading?" Others said, "You didn't issue cotton clothes to those of us working outside, but you issued them to those at home. Where is your sense of principle?" Still others said, "You asked the team leader to drive the car out for one trip and then set the fuel consumption standard based on that. As a result, the task couldn't be completed, and everyone lost enthusiasm for their work."

With so many opinions, what could be done? Zhao Jinshan thought: I was originally a truck driver; I can still drive a truck, but it's just not working out for me as a section chief! Besides, this section is different from other sections. The entire section has more than 180 workers, with car teams, crane teams, horse-drawn cart teams, and warehouses, scattered in every corner of the factory and related to all departments of the factory. How can I shoulder this burden? Forget it, it's better to drive a truck and have peace of mind!

One day, after reading the big-character posters, he ran to look at the large crane again. His mind was churning: The large crane is the largest power transport vehicle in the factory. The several-ton mining machinery produced in the factory relies on it to be lifted onto trains, and the raw materials transported from various places also rely on it to be lifted from the trains to various workshops. Because it has been broken for a long time, when loading, unloading, and installing machine parts, two cranes have to be used instead, which is not only inconvenient but also requires increased labor. One of the cranes is rented from another factory, with a daily rental fee of one hundred yuan. The various parts of an eighty-ton oil drilling rig manufactured by the factory are about to be processed. If the nine-ton crane is not repaired, the installation will be a problem. No wonder the workers are urging me to repair the crane all day long! Because I wanted to save myself trouble, I procrastinated and caused losses to the country! The Party wants us to "ignite the fire on ourselves and temper ourselves," but I want to avoid difficulties when I encounter them. Is this appropriate? He immediately contacted the Electrical and Mechanical Section, the Repair Workshop, the Forging and Riveting Workshop, and the Tool Workshop, and carried the herringbone gear to the Repair Workshop, asking them to repair it quickly. He supervised them step by step, and as a result, the large crane that had been delayed for five months was repaired in just five days this time.

He felt a burst of joy in his heart: It's not that I can't be a section chief, but that I didn't do a good job as a section chief because of procrastination. From then on, his confidence in overcoming shortcomings became even greater. The factory originally had a small car, which often broke down due to disrepair. People were afraid that it would delay things and were unwilling to ride in it, and the driver was unwilling to drive it. Last year, the factory department was asked to approve it for scrapping. This time, the workers said that this was a waste of state property and should be repaired and used. But where to find the parts? Zhao Jinshan was finding it difficult when he suddenly thought of "consulting with the masses when encountering problems," so he went to the workers to study. The workers said: "We can put up big-character posters, and naturally we have a way to repair it, it just depends on whether you believe in the masses." The solution was found: some people went to the warehouse to find old parts, and some people went to the workshop to process or prepare parts. After some repairs, the small car that had been scrapped for more than a year was "revived." Zhao Jinshan felt even more the greatness of the wisdom and strength of the masses. Not long ago, when formulating the winter car fuel consumption standard, he learned from his previous lessons and asked the team leader and some old workers to study it together, using the average of the fuel consumption in the most recent three months as the winter fuel consumption standard. When distributing winter clothing, he organized everyone to discuss it, so that everyone was satisfied.

    不是能力不行
    黄德淑
    “整风真像一服良药，治好了我的许多老毛病。”太原矿山机器厂运输工段段长赵进山开头就跟我这样说。
    他有些什么老毛病呢？工人们在整风中给他提的意见，一共有五十八条。有的说：“九吨大吊车只缺少一个八字牙轮，修理了几个月还没修好，你是怎么领导的？”有的说：“我们在外面干活的，你不发给棉衣；在家里的，却发给他们，你的原则性到哪儿去了？”有的说：“你叫小组长把汽车开出去跑一趟，就订出了用油标准，结果完不成任务，弄得大家伙儿一个个干活没有情绪。”
    这么多意见，怎么办呢？赵进山想：我原来也是一个汽车司机，要我开汽车还可以，要我当工段长就是不行嘛！再说这个工段又和别的工段不同，全段一百八十多个工人，有汽车组、吊车组、马车组、库房，分散在全厂各个角落，和全厂各部门都发生关系。我怎么能担得起这个担子？算了吧，还不如去开汽车省心哩！
    一天，他看了大字报以后，又跑去看大吊车。他脑子里直翻腾：大吊车是全厂最大的一个动力运输车，工厂里生产的几吨重的矿山机器，要靠它吊到火车上去，从各地运来的原料，也靠它从火车上吊送到各个车间，由于它老修不好，装卸和安装机器的部件时，只好用两个吊车来代替，不仅工作起来不方便，还需要增加劳力。其中一部吊车又是从别厂租来的，每天租费一百元。厂里制造的一台八十吨石油钻机，各种部件就要加工好，如果九吨吊车修不好，安装就成问题。难怪工人们整天催促我修理吊车啊！我因为个人图省心，拖拖拉拉，使国家遭受了损失！党要我们“引火烧身，锻炼自己”，我遇到困难就想逃避，这像话吗？他立刻亲自和机电科、修理车间、锻铆车间、工具车间等单位联系，并且到锻铆车间去把八字牙轮扛到修理车间，要求他们快修理。他一步跟一步地督促着，结果，这部拖了五个月没修好的大吊车，这次只五天就修好了。
    他心里感到一阵快慰：并不是自己当不了工段长，而是拖拖拉拉才没当好工段长。从此，他克服缺点的信心更大了。厂里原来有一部小汽车，因年久失修，经常出毛病，人们都怕它误事，不肯坐，司机也不乐意开它，在去年就申请厂部批准报废。这次，工人们说这是浪费国家资财，应当修理使用。但是，到哪里去弄零件呢？赵进山正着难，猛然想起了“遇事同群众商量”，便去找工人们研究。工人们说：“我们能贴大字报，自然有办法修，就是看你相信不相信群众。”办法想出来了：有的人到仓库去找旧零件，有的人到车间去加工或配制零件，经过一番修理，报废了一年多的小汽车“复活”了。赵进山更加感到群众的智慧和力量的伟大。不久前，制订冬季汽车用油标准的时候，他接受了以往的教训，找组长和一些老工人共同研究，以最近三个月用油的平均数作为冬季用油标准。发放御寒衣物的时候，又组织大家讨论，作到了人人满意。
