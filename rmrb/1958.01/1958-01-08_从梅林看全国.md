Today's newspaper publishes news of the Shanghai Meilin Canned Food Factory launching a special campaign against waste. It raises a very important issue that deserves widespread attention from all regions and departments across the country. That is, during the rectification phase of the rectification movement, it is crucial to launch a special criticism and self-criticism campaign and a special rectification centered on anti-waste.

The Meilin Canned Food Factory is a factory of modest size, but the special anti-waste campaign revealed a staggering 450,000 yuan in various wastes over the past four years. This is both shocking and gratifying. It is shocking because the waste over four years accounts for about half of the factory's existing working capital. It is gratifying because it shows how enormous the potential for savings is. The factory's management is not particularly bad, and its production situation cannot be said to be particularly prone to waste. Precisely because of this, the factory's waste phenomenon has particularly significant implications for the whole country. Currently, there are tens of thousands of factories of similar size to Meilin in China. If each factory has waste like Meilin's (i.e., annual waste accounts for 10% to 15% of the total working capital), the combined amount would be enormous. Waste is widespread not only in production but also in capital construction. According to estimates by the State Construction Commission, based on the experience of the First Five-Year Plan, capital construction investment can be saved by 20% to 25% with some specific measures. That is to say, eighty yuan or even seventy-five yuan can be used to do what used to cost one hundred yuan. If this can be achieved, China can save a large amount of funds, which can be used to start more undertakings. It can be said that all undertakings across the country have waste, whether large or small. Whether it is industrial and mining enterprises, transportation departments, financial and trade departments, cultural and educational departments, or agricultural production cooperatives, whether it is the central government or local governments, whether it is urban or rural areas, there is potential for savings. The question is how to uncover all these wastes and overcome them, and conduct our socialist construction more economically.

Our Party and government have always advocated practicing thrift and opposing waste. Because socialist construction requires huge amounts of funds, these funds will neither fall from the sky nor be solved by relying on foreign debt. The basic method is to rely on internal accumulation. Internal accumulation is hard-earned, and any squandering or waste is a crime against the cause of socialism. Moreover, China is a large country that is "poor and blank," and it is particularly difficult to accumulate construction funds, and there are particularly many undertakings that need to be started. Since the founding of the country, the Party and government have led the people of the whole country in continuously fighting against various waste phenomena. Among them, the larger-scale ones were the Three-Anti Movement in 1952 and the Thrift Movement in 1955. The main thrust of the Three-Anti Movement was against corruption, but it also fought against waste and achieved great results. On the basis of the Three-Anti Movement, China began the construction of the First Five-Year Plan in 1953. The main thrust of the Thrift Movement in 1955 was to oppose waste and practice thrift. As a result of this movement, China's fiscal expenditure in 1955 was greatly saved, which not only balanced the budget but also had a large surplus, promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1956. Now, the scale of socialist construction in China is larger than it was a few years ago, and the state spends more funds on various construction undertakings. If we do not pay more attention to saving, a little waste in this place and a little waste in that place will add up to an alarming amount.

In the process of socialist construction in China, some waste is unavoidable due to lack of experience. In this sense, we are "inevitabilists." Because for us, socialist construction is still a relatively unfamiliar thing. We still need to accumulate experience. In the process of construction, it is inevitable to stumble, it is inevitable to make mistakes, and it is inevitable to have shortcomings. However, "inevitabilists" are by no means protectors of errors and shortcomings. On the contrary, once we discover errors and shortcomings, we draw lessons from them, absorb fertilizer, and resolutely fight against these errors and shortcomings. Now that we have the experience of the First Five-Year Plan construction, we should be able to save more effectively. Any excuse of insufficient experience not to expose waste phenomena, not to learn from waste, and not to carry out a resolute struggle against waste phenomena is wrong. It should be pointed out that much waste is not due to lack of experience, but to a lack of the idea of building the country through diligence and thrift. Chairman Mao said in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "We must make all cadres and all the people constantly think that our country is a large socialist country, but also an economically backward poor country. This is a very big contradiction. To enrich and strengthen our country, it will take decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of a policy of building the country with diligence and thrift and opposing waste." Building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift are the fundamental policies for building socialism in our country. To implement this policy, we must resolutely fight against all waste phenomena.

The rectification movement currently underway across the country is a very favorable opportunity to eliminate various waste phenomena. In the rectification movement, many shortcomings and errors in the work that had not been discovered for many years have been exposed, and many problems that had not been solved for many years have been solved. The flames of the mass movement are burning all over the place. Waste phenomena in various places and departments are widespread and massive. Taking advantage of the wind of the rectification movement and igniting the fire of anti-waste can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The reason why the news of the Shanghai Meilin Canned Food Factory published in today's newspaper deserves the attention of the whole country is not only because it illustrates the seriousness of the waste phenomenon, but also because it provides an effective way to overcome this waste, which is to organize a special anti-waste criticism and self-criticism campaign during the rectification phase of the rectification movement to expose all waste phenomena. We believe that all regions and departments across the country should also, like Meilin, launch a high tide of special anti-waste criticism and self-criticism and special rectification, and set a fire to burn all kinds of waste clean. Waste is a loss of national wealth. Overcoming waste can increase national wealth and enable our country to carry out socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically, and give our country a good start to the Second Five-Year Plan starting this year. May the fire of anti-waste ignited from Meilin spread throughout the country! May "Oppose Waste, Build the Country with Diligence and Thrift" become the action slogan of the people of the whole country!

### 从梅林看全国

    从梅林看全国
    今天本报发表的上海梅林罐头食品厂展开反浪费专题鸣放的消息，提出了一个值得全国各地方、各部门普遍注意的十分重要的问题。这就是在整风运动的整改阶段中，十分需要发动一个以反浪费为中心的专题鸣放和专题整改。
    梅林罐头食品厂是一个不大不小的工厂，但是，在反浪费专题鸣放中揭发出过去四年中各种浪费达四十五万元之巨，这是一件十分惊人的事情，同时也是一件十分可喜的事情。说它惊人，就是四年的浪费约占这个厂现有流动资金的一半；说它可喜，就是这件事情说明了节约的潜力多么巨大。这个厂的经营管理并不是特别差，它的生产情况也不能说特别容易发生浪费，唯其如此，这个厂的浪费现象对全国有着特别重大的意义。目前我国有成千上万像梅林这样规模的工厂，如果每个厂都有像梅林这样的浪费（即每年有占流动资金总值10％到15％的浪费），加起来是一个多么巨大的数目。不仅生产方面普遍存在着浪费，而且基本建设方面也普遍存在着浪费。据国家建设委员会估计，根据第一个五年计划的经验，只要采取一些具体措施，基本建设投资可以节省20％到25％，就是说，可以用八十元、甚至七十五元办过去用一百元办的事情。如果能够做到这样，我国可以节省一大笔资金，拿这笔资金就可以兴办更多的事业。可以这样说，全国各项事业，都有或大或小的浪费。无论是工矿企业、交通运输部门、财政贸易部门、文化教育部门或农业生产合作社，无论是中央或各地方，无论是城市或农村，都有可以节省的，节约的潜力是很大的。问题在于怎样把所有这些浪费都通通揭发出来，并且把它们加以克服，更节省地进行我国的社会主义建设。
    我们党和政府向来就主张厉行节约，反对浪费。因为社会主义建设需要巨额的资金，这些资金既不会从天上掉下来，也不能依靠借外债来解决，基本的办法就是依靠内部积累。内部积累一点一滴来之不易，任何挥霍、浪费都是对社会主义事业的犯罪行为。而且我国又是一个“又穷又白”的大国，积累建设资金尤其不易，需要兴办的事业又特别众多。建国以来，党和政府领导全国人民不断地对各种浪费现象进行了斗争。其中规模较大的有1952年的三反运动和1955年的节约运动。三反运动的主要锋芒是反对贪污，同时也对浪费现象进行了斗争，并且收到了很大的成绩。在三反运动的基础上，我国从1953年开始了第一个五年计划的建设。1955年的节约运动主要的锋芒是反对浪费，厉行节约。由于这个运动，我国1955年的财政开支大大节省了，不仅平衡了预算，而且有了很大的结余，促进了1956年工农业生产的大跃进。现在，我国社会主义建设的规模较之几年以前更大了，国家用在各项建设事业上的资金更多了，如果不更加注意节约，这个地方浪费一点，那个地方浪费一点，加起来就是一个惊人的数目。
    在我国社会主义建设过程中，由于缺乏经验，有些浪费是难以避免的。在这个意义上，我们是“难免论者”。因为对于我们来说，社会主义建设还是一件比较生疏的事情，还需要积累经验，在建设过程中难免不跌跤，难免不犯错误，难免没有缺点。但是“难免论者”决不是错误和缺点的保护者。恰恰相反，我们一经发现了错误和缺点，就从中吸取教训，吸取肥料，并且坚决地同这些错误和缺点作斗争。现在我们已经有了第一个五年计划建设的经验，应该可以更有效地进行节约了。任何借口经验不足而不去揭发浪费现象，不去从浪费中吸取经验教训，不去同浪费现象进行坚决斗争，都是错误的。应该指出，有许多浪费并不是由于缺乏经验，而是由于缺乏勤俭建国的思想。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中说：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业，这是我国建设社会主义的根本方针。要贯彻这个方针，就必须同一切浪费现象进行坚决的斗争。
    目前正在全国进行的整风运动，正是消灭各种浪费现象的十分有利的时机。在整风运动中，许多多年没有发现的工作中的缺点和错误被揭发出来了，许多多年没有解决的问题解决了。群众运动的烽火，正在烧遍各个角落。各个地方和各个部门中的浪费现象是普遍的大量的。乘整风运动之风，点起反浪费之火，可以收到事半功倍之效。今天本报刊载的上海梅林罐头食品厂的新闻之所以值得全国重视，不仅在于它说明了浪费现象的严重性，而且它还提供了克服这种浪费的有效办法，这就是在整风运动的整改阶段中，组织反浪费的专题鸣放，把浪费现象通通揭发出来。我们认为，全国各个地方、各个部门，也应该像梅林这样，掀起一个反浪费的专题鸣放和专题整改的高潮，放一把火把各种浪费烧个干净。浪费是国家财富的损失，克服了浪费，就可以为国家增加财富，使我们的国家能够又多又快又好又省地进行社会主义建设，使我国从今年开始的第二个五年计划有一个良好的开端。愿从梅林点起反浪费之火燃遍全国！愿“反对浪费、勤俭建国”成为全国人民的行动口号！
