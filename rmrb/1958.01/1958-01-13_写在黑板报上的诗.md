Poems Written on the Blackboard Newspaper
Li Xue'ao

          First
    Always thinks of oneself as good steel,
    Only suitable for making blades and pillars.
    Throw yourself into the furnace,
    Let the raging fire test—
    Don't paste pretty slogans on your mouth!

          Second
    Go to the countryside! Go to the countryside! Go to the countryside!
    Go to the mountains! Go to the mountains! Go to the mountains!
    The Party's bugle is loud and clear,
    The mighty队伍 advances quickly.
    But you, why are you hesitating at the crossroads,
    Hesitating and struggling to decide?
    Is it because you can't bear to leave the comfortable life in the city?
    Are you afraid of the wind and sand in the fields stinging your face?
    Do you dislike the "dirty" and "smelly" environment in the countryside?
    Or is it from the depths of your heart
    That you look down on the hoe?
    Ah, quickly put down your airs!
    With the steps of contemporaries,
    Catch up with the mighty队伍!
    Catch up!

    写在黑板报上的诗
    李学鳌
          其一总认为自己是好钢，只可以做刀刃、栋梁。投入到熔炉中去吧，让熊熊的烈火检验——不能把漂亮的标语贴在嘴上！
          其二下乡！下乡！下乡！上山！上山！上山！党的号角嘹亮，雄壮的队伍快步向前。而你呀，为什么徘徊在十字路口，踌踌躇躇左右为难？是离不开城市的安逸生活？是怕田野里的风沙刺脸？是嫌农村环境“脏”、“臭”？还是从心底深处
    看不起那锄杆？啊，快放下你的架子！以同时代人的脚步，把雄壮的队伍追赶！追赶！
