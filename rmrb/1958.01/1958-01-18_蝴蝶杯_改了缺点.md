    "Butterfly Cup" Corrects Shortcomings
    The "Butterfly Cup," recently revised and performed by the China Peking Opera Theatre, is a traditional play quite popular in various operas, originally depicted with delicacy and strong expressiveness. However, the latter part had a rather serious shortcoming: the sharp struggle between Hu Fenglian, Tian Yucuan, and Governor-General Lu Lin actually compromised because Tian Yucuan married Lu Lin's daughter, which cast a layer of feudal dust over the play.
    This performance of "Butterfly Cup" deleted the plot of Tian Yucuan marrying Lu Lin's daughter, and made the struggle between Tian Yucuan and Lu Lin run through to the end, thus making the themes of justice and injustice more prominent. (Zhong Wen)

    “蝴蝶杯”改了缺点
    中国京剧院最近整理、演出的“蝴蝶杯”，是一出在各种戏曲中相当流行的传统剧目，原本描写细腻、表现力很强。但后半部有较为严重的缺点：胡凤莲、田玉川与总督卢林的尖锐斗争，竟因田玉川娶了卢林的女儿而妥协，使这出戏蒙上了一层封建性的灰尘。
    这次演出的“蝴蝶杯”删去了田玉川和卢林女儿结婚的情节，并使田玉川和卢林之间的斗争贯串到底，正义和非正义的主题因而更加突出。　（锺文）
