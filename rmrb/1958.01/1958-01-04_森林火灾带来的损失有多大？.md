How Great is the Loss from Forest Fires?

　　Fire is the greatest enemy of forests. Before 1956, an average of 1.61 million hectares of forest were damaged by forest fires each year throughout the country.

　　Taking 1951 as an example: 1.6 million hectares of forest were burned down, resulting in a loss of 5.2 million cubic meters of timber. This timber could be used to build 38 million square meters of houses. If this timber were used to make railway sleepers, it could lay 18,000 kilometers of railway tracks. If this timber were converted into money, it could buy more than 12,660 tractors, several hundred more than the total number of agricultural tractors added during China's First Five-Year Plan.

    森林火灾带来的损失有多大？
    火灾是森林最大的敌人。1956年以前，全国由于山林火灾，平均每年有一百六十一万公顷森林被害。
    以1951年为例：烧毁的森林一百六十万公顷、损失木材五百二十万立方公尺；这些木材可以建筑三千八百万平方公尺房屋；用这些木材作成枕木，可以铺铁轨一万八千公里；这些木材如果折成钱，可以买一万二千六百六十多台拖拉机，比我国第一个五年计划期间增加的农业拖拉机总数还多几百台。
