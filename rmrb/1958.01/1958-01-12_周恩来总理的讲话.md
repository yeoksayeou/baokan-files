Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respectable Ambassador, respectable Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr, ladies and gentlemen:

Thank you to Ambassador Ragheb and his wife for holding this banquet, giving us the opportunity to once again gather with Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr and other distinguished Yemeni guests. Just now, Ambassador Ragheb praised the Chinese people's resolute support for the people of Egypt, Yemen, and other Arab countries. On behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to thank Ambassador Ragheb. At the same time, I want to state that the Chinese people do this because it is our bounden international duty. The Chinese people have always believed that the struggle of the people of Arab countries against colonialism and for the achievement and maintenance of national independence is our struggle, and the victories achieved by the people of Arab countries in this just struggle are also our victories. The Chinese people feel very honored to have the people of many Arab countries as their friends. This visit to China by Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr has further developed the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Arab countries, and has created a very good start for future mutual visits and contacts between the leaders of China and Arab countries.

The Chinese people are very pleased to see that the people of Arab countries are strengthening their unity, waging a resolute struggle to safeguard national independence and territorial integrity, and constantly thwarting the various aggressive plots of imperialism in Yemen, Egypt, and Syria. However, the imperialist aggressive bloc has not given up because of their failures. They are still strengthening military bases in the Middle East, carrying out subversive activities, and creating tension. Recently, the meeting of the North Atlantic Group in Paris not only decided to step up arms expansion and war preparation, but also attempted to arrogantly interfere in the affairs of the people of Middle Eastern Arab countries. However, now that the people of Asia and Africa have awakened, the imperialist conspiracy is doomed to failure. The Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group has been severely condemned by the people of Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and peace-loving countries around the world. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which recently closed victoriously in Cairo, fully demonstrated the common desire of the Asian and African people to unite to safeguard national independence, strive for peaceful coexistence among countries, and defend world peace, and it has received enthusiastic support from the people all over the world. The repercussions caused by these two meetings of opposite nature in the world fully reflect the general trend and the direction of popular sentiment. The course of history will further prove that the will of the people of the world to demand peace will surely defeat the conspiracy of war and aggression by the imperialist bloc.

The day after tomorrow, Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr will conclude his visit to China. I would like to ask the Crown Prince to bring back to the Yemeni people, who are waging a heroic struggle against imperialism, the highest respect of the Chinese people. The people of Yemen are by no means isolated. First of all, the tens of millions of people of Arab countries resolutely support you, and the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world also resolutely support you. Although there are still difficulties and twists and turns ahead, your struggle is bound to be victorious.

Ladies and gentlemen, I propose:

    For the unity and friendly cooperation of the people of Arab countries and the people of Asian and African countries,
    For world peace,
    For the health of His Majesty King Imam Ahmad of Yemen,
    For the health of His Excellency President Nasser of Egypt,
    For the health of Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr and all distinguished Yemeni guests,
    A toast to the health of today's host, Ambassador Ragheb and his wife!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    尊敬的大使阁下，尊敬的穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下：女士们，先生们：
    感谢拉加卜大使阁下和他的夫人举行这个宴会，使我们有机会再一次同穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下和其他各位也门贵宾欢聚在一起。刚才拉加卜大使阁下称赞了中国人民对埃及、也门和其他阿拉伯各国人民的坚决支持。我代表中国人民向拉加卜大使阁下表示感谢。同时，我要说明，中国人民这样作，是因为这是我们应尽的国际义务。中国人民一向认为，阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争就是我们的斗争，阿拉伯各国人民在这个正义斗争中取得的胜利也就是我们的胜利。中国人民能够有许多阿拉伯国家的人民作为自己的朋友，感到十分荣幸。这次穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下到中国来访问，使中国人民同阿拉伯各国人民的友谊又向前发展了一步，并且为中国和阿拉伯各国的领导人员今后的互相访问和接触，创造了一个非常良好的开端。
    中国人民很高兴地看到，阿拉伯各国人民正在加强团结，为维护国家的独立和领土的完整，进行坚决的斗争，并且不断地挫败帝国主义在也门、埃及和叙利亚的各种侵略阴谋。但是，帝国主义侵略集团并没有因为他们的失败而罢手。它们还在中东地区加强军事基地，进行颠覆活动，制造紧张局势。最近，北大西洋集团在巴黎举行的会议，不仅决定加紧扩军备战，而且还企图横暴地干涉中东阿拉伯各国人民的事务。但是，在亚非人民已经觉醒的现在，帝国主义的阴谋是注定要失败的。北大西洋集团的巴黎会议已经遭到了阿拉伯国家、亚非国家和全世界爱好和平国家的人民的严厉谴责。最近在开罗胜利闭幕的亚非人民团结大会充分地表现了亚非人民团结起来维护民族独立、争取各国和平共处和保卫世界和平的共同愿望，它受到了全世界人民的热烈支持。这两个性质相反的会议，在世界上所引起的反响，充分地反映了当前的大势所趋和人心所向。历史的进程将会进一步证明，全世界人民要求和平的意志，一定会战胜帝国主义集团的战争和侵略的阴谋。
    后天，穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下将要结束他在中国的访问。我请王太子殿下把中国人民最崇高的敬意带回给正在同帝国主义进行英勇斗争的也门人民。也门人民决不是孤立的。首先有阿拉伯各国的几千万人民坚决地支持你们，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民也坚决地支持你们。尽管前面的道路还有困难和曲折，你们的斗争是一定会取得胜利的。
    女士们，先生们，我提议：
    为阿拉伯各国人民和亚非各国人民的团结和友好合作，
    为世界和平，
    为也门国王伊玛姆·艾哈迈德陛下的健康，
    为埃及总统纳赛尔阁下的健康，
    为穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下和各位也门贵宾的健康，
    为今天宴会的主人，拉加卜大使阁下和他的夫人的健康，干杯！
