    China Zhi Gong Party Standing Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting
    Decides to Launch Rectification Movement in Local Organizations

    (Dispatch) The seventh enlarged meeting of the Sixth Central Standing Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party was held in Beijing from January 16th to 23rd. In addition to the members of the Central Standing Committee, central committee members in Beijing and principal leaders from provinces and cities also attended the meeting. The meeting summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the anti-Rightist struggle and discussed how to launch a rectification movement within the entire Zhi Gong Party on the basis of the victory in the anti-Rightist struggle.

    The meeting unanimously held that, because the Zhi Gong Party is a bourgeois democratic party, although the anti-Rightist struggle has basically concluded victoriously within the entire party (some local organizations have not yet concluded), the entire party received a profound socialist education in the struggle, and politically and ideologically demarcated itself from the Rightists. However, the anti-Rightist struggle also exposed that most members of the Zhi Gong Party still have various degrees of errors in politics and ideology. Therefore, it was resolved that local organizations must, after the end of the anti-Rightist struggle, immediately, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, move into a general rectification movement focused on changing their stance.

    During the meeting, problems such as "big party" thinking (competing with the Communist Party) and the malicious development of organizations were also examined, and the leadership and relevant personnel were seriously criticized.

    中国致公党常委会召开扩大会议
    决定各地方组织开展整风运动
    本报讯　中国致公党第六届中央常务委员会第七次扩大会议于1月16日至23日在北京举行。除中央常务委员会委员外，在京中央委员和从各地来的省、市主要负责人也参加了这次会议。会议总结了反右派斗争的经验教训，讨论了如何在反右派斗争胜利的基础上在致公党全党范围内展开整风运动等问题。
    会议一致认为，由于致公党是资产阶级性的民主党派，反右派斗争虽然在全党范围内基本上胜利结束了（有的地方组织还未结束），在斗争中全党受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，在政治上和思想上与右派分子划清了界限；但从反右派斗争的过程中，也暴露了致公党的大多数成员在政治上和思想上还存在着各种不同程度的错误。因此，决议各地方组织必须在反右派斗争结束后，立即在中国共产党领导下转入以改变立场为主的一般整风运动。
    会议中还对大党思想（与共产党分庭抗礼）、恶性发展组织等问题做了检查，领导上和有关的人员都受到了严肃的批判。
