    In many areas, young people have formed special teams (groups) and reconnaissance teams to eliminate the four pests, based on their production and living conditions. They put forward the slogans "Scout the enemy during the day, raid the camps at night" and "Combine family and field elimination." They used slingshots, sieve traps, brick presses, net captures, hand captures, and mud nests to kill sparrows everywhere. They used wooden cats (tools for hitting rats), door panels, water irrigation, smoke fumigation, blocking, poisoning and other methods to eliminate rats. According to incomplete statistics from five counties, including Lintao, Yongchang, and Ningshuo, more than 30,000 young people eliminated more than 720,000 sparrows and rats in half a month.
