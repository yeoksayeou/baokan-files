    Quickly Stop This Wasteful Trend
    The trend of "treating guests" in rural areas is still very prevalent. I conducted a detailed survey in the third team of the Huxi Agricultural Cooperative in Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province. In this team, out of twenty households, except for one household from a distant village and one widowed and orphaned household, the other eighteen households held banquets and gave gifts a total of two hundred and ten times last year, spending more than 550 yuan, an average of more than 30 yuan per household. Among them, the household that gave the most gifts spent more than 40 yuan, and the least spent more than 10 yuan.
    Because this expenditure is large, the lives of the commune members have undoubtedly been affected to some extent. The team increased production in both agriculture and sideline occupations last year, with an average income of about 60 yuan per person. However, after the distribution of profits, apart from two households with income, the other dozen households had a total of more than 6,000 jin of grain pledged to the cooperative that they could not afford to buy back, with the household with the most pledged grain reaching more than 1,000 jin. Li Duohai's family, for example, could have had a surplus of more than 80 yuan after deducting food rations, feed, and debts from their total annual income, but now they have also pledged more than 690 jin of grain and have no money to buy it back. The reason is that the money was spent on banquets (weddings) and gift-giving. Li Qianfu's family has eight mouths to feed, with three full laborers. Last year, the average income per person reached more than 100 yuan, and their life should be very prosperous. But due to gift-giving and the banquet for his second son's wedding, they spent more than 200 yuan and also ate more than 100 jin of pork. Now his family's life is also feeling strained, not only lacking money but also having consumed more than two-thirds of their annual grain ration by the end of December.
    "Human affection is like fire." Some people, in order to maintain "face," have no money to give gifts, so they go around borrowing from others, some even sell the grain they bought back home, and some even sell an egg or a breeding hen. At present, the Party and the government are calling on us to be diligent and thrifty in managing our households, so the trend of "holding wedding banquets" and "treating guests" in rural areas should be stopped quickly. This is indeed a great waste.

    赶快制止这种浪费之风
    现在农村“请客”的风气仍然很盛。我在江西省弋阳县的湖西农业社第三小队详细地摸了一下底，这个队去年“办喜事”的和“送礼”的，全队二十户人家，除了一户远乡人和一户孤寡外其它十八户共请客和送礼二百一十次，共花去五百五十多元，平均每户达三十元以上。其中送礼最多的一户达到四十元以上，最少的也达到十元以上。
    由于这笔开支大，社员的生活无疑地受到了一些影响。这个队去年农业、副业都增了产，每人平均收入达到六十元左右。可是收益分配以后，除了两户有进款以外，其它十几户共计押在社里未买回家的口粮有六千多斤，最多的户押粮达到一千斤以上。社员李度海家，全年总收入除了口粮、饲料、欠款等以外，本来可以剩余八十多元，可是现在也押了口粮六百九十多斤无钱买回去。原因就是那些钱请客（娶亲）和送礼花光了。社员李千福家里有八口人吃饭，三个全劳动力，去年每人平均收入达到一百元以上，生活应当是很富裕的。但由于送礼和二儿子结婚请客就花了二百多元，还吃了一百多斤猪肉，现在他家的生活也感到紧张起来了，不仅缺钱用，而且全年的口粮到12月末为止已经吃掉了三分之二多。
    “人情逼如火”，有些人为了顾全“情面”，没有钱送礼，就到处向人家扯账，有的将自己买回家的口粮又挑去卖掉，甚至有的连一个鸡蛋，或者母鸡种也拿去卖掉。目前，党和政府正号召我们勤俭持家，所以，农村中这种“办喜事”“请客”的风气应当赶快制止一下，这确是一种很大的浪费。
