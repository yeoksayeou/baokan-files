Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 25th. Tens of thousands of cadres in Jiangxi Province who have been sent down to the mountainous areas have already settled in over a hundred mountain locations, and through their courageous labor, they have achieved the first batch of successes in developing the mountainous regions.

After arriving at their bases in late December and early January of last year and this year, these labor warriors immediately built thatched huts and set up stoves, settling in within a few days. Then, they began the work of reclamation, road building, and vegetable planting. "Minor injuries are nothing; don't leave the front line!" became their battle cry. More than two hundred cadres sent down to Jinping Farm in the Ji'an Special District persisted in reclaiming wasteland in the cold weather of howling north winds and heavy fog turning into drizzle, digging up more than 40 mu of tree stumps every day. The cadres at Donggu Farm in the Ji'an Special District, regardless of the heavy rain and snow, steep slopes, and slippery roads, persisted in surveying the Dagan Mountain. One team member described their magnificent spirit: "Riding the morning breeze, climbing steep cliffs, floating through clouds and mist; treading the setting sun, crossing the forest sea, returning home to meet the night." Veterans who had participated in the 25,000-li Long March showed undiminished courage in their hard fight against nature. Old Red Army soldier Yang Shunhe, after arriving at the Qianshan No. 2 Reclamation Farm, went to the fields and climbed the mountains every day like a young man, leading by example even with blisters on his hands. Zhang Xuefu, a demobilized old company commander in his fifties at Moshanchang, refused to admit he was old and often overfulfilled his weeding and plowing tasks. Young people became even more active in their work. The Paul Youth Reclamation Team at Phoenix Mountain Farm always volunteered to undertake arduous tasks, and female cadres worked just as vigorously as male cadres in their labor.

Currently, simple highways have been built at the headquarters of Yunshan, Jinping, and other farms. Some farms have already set up telephones, and some have built power stations, with electric lights beginning to illuminate the bases in the mountains. Jinping Farm has already reclaimed more than 1,000 mu of land, cut hundreds of thousands of jin of firewood, and planted dozens of mu of vegetables. Mengshan Farm has already picked 61 dan of tree seeds, enough to green 1,800 mu of barren mountains. A large amount of timber felled at Yunshan Farm has been transported down the mountain. Some farms have already sown seeds.

    垦荒、筑路、种菜开始了建设山区的第一步
    江西数万下放干部干劲十足
    他们的气概是：乘晨风，登峭壁，腾云驾雾；踏夕阳，渡林海，迎夜而归
    新华社南昌25日电　江西省下放到山区的数万名干部，已经在一百多个山头安好了家，并且在奋勇的劳动中取得了开发山区的第一批成绩。
    这批劳动战士在去年12月和今年1月初先后到达基地后，立即盖起了茅棚，搭起了炉灶，几天内就安好了家。接着，他们就开始了垦荒、筑路和种菜的劳动。“轻伤不下火线”成了他们的战斗口号。下放到吉安专区金坪场的二百多个干部，在北风呼啸、大雾变成细雨的寒冷天气中坚持开荒，每天挖四十多亩的树兜。吉安专区东固场的干部们不顾大雨大雪，坡陡路滑，坚持勘测大甘山。一个队员这样描写他们的磅礴的气概：“乘晨风，登峭壁，腾云驾雾；踏夕阳，渡林海，迎夜而归。”曾经参加过二万五千里长征的战士，在与大自然进行苦战中奋勇不减当年。老红军战士杨顺和到铅山第二垦殖场后，天天同青年人一样地下地上山，即使手上打起血泡，也是领先苦干。墨山场五十多岁的复员老连长张学富也毫不服老，往往超额完成锄草翻地任务。青年们在劳动中更加活跃。凤凰山场保尔青年垦荒队，总是自告奋勇地担负艰苦的工作，女干部在劳动中也和男干部一样干得很起劲。
    现在，云山、金坪等场已修好了场部简便公路，有些场已经架好电话，有的场已经建造了发电站，电灯开始照亮山间的基地。金坪场已经开荒一千多亩，砍柴几十万斤，种菜几十亩。蒙山场已经摘下六十一担树种，足够绿化一千八百亩荒山。云山场大量采伐的木材部分已运下山。有的场已经播下种子。
