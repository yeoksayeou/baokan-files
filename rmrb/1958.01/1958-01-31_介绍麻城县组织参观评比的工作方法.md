Organizing mass visits and comparisons has become an important method for guiding agricultural production in Macheng County, Hubei Province. The county has made many creative efforts in organizing visits and comparisons. Due to the rich content and frequent use of visits and comparisons, they have played a very significant role in the development of agriculture.

The visits and comparisons in Macheng County can basically be divided into two types. One type mainly focuses on disseminating advanced experiences. For example, when a new achievement or experience is discovered in a certain township or commune in a certain area of work, representatives from all townships and communes in the county, or nearby townships and communes, are organized to visit, depending on the value of the achievement or experience. Discussions are organized during the visits to gradually spread the experience. This type of visit and comparison is irregular, organized whenever something is discovered. The other type is mutual visits and comparisons, which involves visiting advanced townships and communes as well as ordinary and backward ones. Participants include representatives from each township and commune. This type of visit and comparison is basically regular, organized according to different production seasons. It can both disseminate advanced experiences and serve as a means of inspection and supervision.

The above two methods of visits and comparisons were widely used in Macheng County last year. Regarding the former, in addition to those organized by the county leadership, many were also organized by districts and townships. Last year, Li Sheng Township alone received thousands of visitors from all over the county, and the advanced experiences in cotton production created by this township were widely promoted throughout the county. Regarding the latter, a total of three large-scale county-wide visits and comparisons were organized before the autumn harvest last year, with more than 1,000 representatives from each township and commune participating each time.

Macheng County organizes the latter type of visits and comparisons with leadership, preparation, and clear goals. The specific methods are: First, leaders from the county party committee and the county people's committee personally participate in each visit, along with representatives from each township and commune in the county. They are divided into several groups to visit all townships and communes in the county. When they arrive at a township or commune, they use field visits and individual interviews to affirm achievements and shortcomings according to the comparison criteria, and point out the direction for future progress. Second, each visit and comparison is conducted during important production seasons, and the comparison criteria are formulated based on the key issues of different seasons. Each place is notified a month before each visit and comparison. Third, after the visits, the townships and communes are classified and ranked by group, with rewards for the good ones and criticism for the bad ones. At the same time, experiences and lessons are exchanged through the comparisons, and improvement measures are studied. Fourth, after the visits and comparisons, effective measures are taken to strengthen the leadership of those backward townships and communes with greater difficulties, and provide them with material support to help them change their backwardness. The result of this is that before each visit and comparison, the cadres and masses in the vast townships and communes check and improve the work of their own township or commune according to the comparison criteria that have been notified in advance, thereby forming a new production upsurge. After the visits and comparisons, the advanced ones continue to organize forces to overcome shortcomings in order to maintain their glory, while the backward ones strive to catch up with the advanced ones, thereby further promoting the production upsurge. From the leadership's perspective, through the visits and comparisons, they can have a relatively comprehensive understanding of which townships and communes have what experiences and which townships and communes have what problems, which helps to further strengthen leadership. When this type of visit and comparison is combined with the type mentioned earlier that mainly disseminates advanced experiences, the effect is even greater.

In the process of striving for large-scale balanced production increases in Macheng County last year, many facts vividly illustrated the role of visits and comparisons. During the first county-wide large-scale visit and comparison last year, representatives from various townships found that the cotton in Wangjiaji Township was not growing well and criticized it. However, the township cadres were not convinced, saying that it was not because of poor cultivation, but because the land was not good and could not grow good cotton. The representatives were dissatisfied with the attitude of the township cadres and wrote a allegro verse to criticize them: "Visiting Wangjiaji, cotton is really sparse, the cultivation is too shallow, only scratching the surface, the cotton doesn't grow well, always blaming the land." After receiving this satirical poem, Township Head Gui Zhenyou was both ashamed and embarrassed, and quickly called together the township cadres and the masses to a meeting. He read the poem aloud to everyone and said, "You see, the representatives have visited our township like this, what should we do?" After listening, the township cadres, commune cadres, and the masses who attended the meeting all patted their chests and promised to catch up within seven days. As a result, the masses in the entire township took action and worked hard for seven days, cultivating, weeding, and topdressing all the fields where cotton was not growing well, so that the cotton seedling growth gradually improved. Later, the township sent representatives to Li Sheng Township several times to visit and learn, and promoted the advanced experience there. By the time of the second visit and comparison, it had jumped from a third-class township to a first-class township. After the autumn harvest, the average yield of ginned cotton in this township reached 120 jin per mu. Baijiao Township had 8,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the first visit and comparison last year, and was also rated as a third-class township. However, the situation in this township was somewhat different from that in Wangjiaji Township. Although its backwardness was related to insufficient subjective efforts, it did have greater objective difficulties. In response to this situation, the representatives not only criticized it, but also suggested that the county find ways to provide assistance. As a result, the county sent six cadres to strengthen leadership and provided 100,000 jin of cake fertilizer. By the time of the second visit and comparison, all the third-class seedlings in the township had been eliminated. Last year, the township also achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. According to statistics, during the first visit and comparison last year, there were a total of 12 third-class townships, 126 third-class communes, and 120,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the county. By the time of the second visit and comparison, only four third-class townships remained, the number of third-class communes had dropped to 62, and the number of third-class seedlings had dropped to 60,000 mu. By the time of the third visit and comparison, all third-class townships, communes, and seedlings had been eliminated, and the county had achieved a great leap forward in grain and cotton production: the grain yield per mu reached 809 jin, an increase of 17% over the previous year; the ginned cotton yield per mu reached 103 jin, an increase of 70% over the previous year.

After last year's bumper harvest, the Macheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experience of last year's visits and comparisons, believing that widely organizing visits and comparisons is a good way for the masses to educate and inspect themselves and supervise each other, so that the advanced can lead the backward and the backward can catch up with the advanced. It is a huge driving force for promoting an all-round leap forward in production. It was decided to continue this method and continue to develop it.

During the winter production, mass visits and comparisons have become more colorful. In particular, during a county-wide visit and comparison conducted from the end of last year to the beginning of January this year, the experience of Wangjiaji Township's transformation last year was summarized and promoted, and the form of allegro verse was widely used in the comparisons. In addition, these allegro verses created by the masses on the spot were published in large characters, which greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of the visits and comparisons. These allegro verses contain both praise and criticism, as well as suggestions, and the language is vivid and easily accepted by the masses. For example, the allegro verse praising the Flying Leap Fourth Cooperative of Xicheng Township reads: "Walking, walking, walking, the Flying Leap Fourth Cooperative is in sight. The representatives carefully watch, and see everything clearly: the rapeseed is good, the wheat is green, fertilizer has been applied to every plot; the weeds have been hoeed, everything is new, and the ditches are neatly opened." The allegro verse criticizing and suggesting improvements to the tea mountain management of the Jianxin First Cooperative of Xiongjiagou says: "Upon entering the oil tea garden, near the edge of the First Cooperative, the tea trees are truly extensive, covering the mountains; one mu of tea garden is worth ten mu of fields, the potential of the mountainous area is better than the plains, the direction of management is unclear, no one cares; such good tea seed mountains, the representatives praise, only regretting that no one asks, how pitiful; the representatives suggest, quickly change the barren mountains, and should allocate labor to manage them." There are many such allegro verses. After visiting a township or commune, the representatives of the visits and comparisons expressed their feelings in allegro verses. In particular, allegro verses were created in large numbers after visiting those townships and communes that were doing well and those that were not doing well. Because the allegro verses were posted in the most conspicuous places, the criticisms and praises of the representatives immediately spread throughout the township and commune, having a great impact. The townships and communes that were criticized immediately took action to overcome their shortcomings, while those that were praised actively sought ways to maintain their glory. After being criticized, Cai Dian Township mobilized 2,000 people as soon as the visiting delegation left, and in two consecutive days and nights, they topdressed, weeded, and cleared the ditches of more than 1,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the Pai Dui Gang area, quickly changing the backward appearance of those third-class seedlings. In the days following the county-wide visits and comparisons, the labor force engaged in emergency topdressing, weeding, and water conservancy reached as many as 180,000 people.

    介绍麻城县组织参观评比的工作方法
    新华社记者　方堤
    组织群众性的参观评比，在湖北省麻城县已经成为一种领导农业生产的重要方法。这个县在组织参观评比中进行了许多创造性的工作。由于参观评比的内容丰富，运用经常，对农业的发展起了十分显著的作用。
    麻城县的参观评比基本上可以分成两种。一种主要是传播先进经验。如发现某乡或某社在某项工作上有新的成就和经验时，就根据其价值的大小，组织全县各乡、社或附近乡、社派代表前往参观，并在参观过程中组织讨论，使这种经验逐步地得到传播。这种参观评比是不定期的，随时发现就随时组织。还有一种是相互参观评比，即既要参观先进的乡、社，也要参观一般的和落后的乡、社，参加参观评比的人，包括各乡、各社的代表。这种参观评比基本上是定期的，根据不同的生产季节来组织，它既能起传播先进经验的作用，又能起检查、督促的作用。
    上述两种参观评比方法，去年就已经在麻城县得到极广泛的运用。关于前一种，除了县的领导上组织的以外，各区、各乡组织的也很多。去年，仅李胜乡就接待了本县各地前来参观的几千人，这个乡创造的有关棉花生产的先进经验大都在全县范围内得到推广。关于后一种，仅全县性的大型参观评比，去年秋收前共组织了三次，每次都有各乡、社代表一千多人参加。
    麻城县组织后一种参观评比时，完全是在有领导、有准备、有明确目标的情况下进行的。具体作法是：第一，每次都由县委和县人民委员会的领导干部亲自参加，同时也有全县各乡、社的代表参加。他们分成几个片，把全县所有乡、社都走到，每到一个乡或一个社时，都采用田间参观和个别访问等形式，按评比条件，肯定成绩和缺点，并且指出前进的方向；第二，每次参观评比都是选重要的生产季节来进行，评比条件也根据不同季节的关键问题来拟定，并且每次都在进行参观评比前一个月通知各地；第三，参观完后，按片将各乡、社分类站队，好的奖励，坏的批评，同时通过评比交流经验教训，研究改进措施；第四，经过参观评比后，对那些困难较大的落后乡、社，采取有效措施加强领导，在物质上给以支援，帮助它们改变落后面貌。这样作的结果是：每次参观评比前，广大乡、社的干部和群众为了迎接参观评比，纷纷根据早已通知的评比条件来检查和改进本乡、本社的工作，从而形成新的生产高潮；参观评比以后，先进的为了保持光荣，落后的为了赶上先进，继续组织力量，克服缺点，从而又推动生产高潮前进；从领导方面来看，通过参观评比后，哪些乡、社有什么经验，哪些乡、社有什么问题，都能比较全面地了解，这就有助于进一步加强领导。而当这种参观评比和前面谈到的那种主要是传播先进经验的参观评比相结合后，所产生的作用就更大了。
    麻城县去年在争取大面积平衡增产的过程中，许多事实生动地说明了参观评比的作用。去年举行第一次全县大参观评比时，各乡代表发现王家集乡的棉花长得不好，提出了批评。可是乡干部还不服气，说不是耕作不好，而是土地不好，长不出好棉花来。代表对乡干部的态度不满意，作了一首快板诗来批评：“参观王家集，棉花真稀奇，中耕太浅了，只刮一层皮，棉花长不好，老是怪土地。”乡长桂真友拿到这首讽刺诗后，又羞又愧，连忙把乡干部和群众找来开会，向大家宣读了这首诗，他对大家说：“你们看，代表们把我们乡参观成这样子了，看怎么办吧？”乡干部、社干部和到会群众听了后，一个个都拍胸保证，要在七天内赶上去。结果，全乡群众都行动起来了，紧张地突击了七天，把所有棉花长得不好的田都进行了中耕、锄草和追肥，使棉苗生长情况逐日好转。以后，这个乡又几次派代表到李胜乡去参观学习。推行了那里的先进经验。到第二次参观评比时，由三类乡一跃而为一类乡。秋收后，这个乡亩产皮棉平均达到一百二十斤。拜交乡在去年第一次参观评比时，全乡有三类苗八千亩，也被评为三类乡了。但是，这个乡的情况和王家集乡有些不同，它的落后虽然和主观努力不够有关，但客观上的确也有较大困难。针对这种情况，代表们除给以批评外，还建议县里设法给予帮助。结果，县里派了六个干部去加强领导，还先后支援了十万斤饼肥，到第二次参观评比时，全乡的三类苗全都消灭了。去年，这个乡的粮食、棉花也都获得了丰收。据统计，去年第一次参观评比时，全县共有十二个三类乡，一百二十六个三类社，十二万亩三类苗。到第二次参观评比时，三类乡只剩下四个，三类社降到六十二个，三类苗降到六万亩。而到第三次参观评比时，已全部消灭了三类乡、社和三类苗，全县因而实现了粮、棉生产大跃进：粮食亩产达到八百零九斤，比前年增产17％；皮棉亩产达到一百零三斤，比前年增产70％。
    去年丰收以后，中共麻城县委对去年参观评比的经验进行了总结，认为广泛地组织参观评比，是群众自我教育、自我检查和相互督促，使先进带动落后，落后赶上先进的好办法，是推动生产全面跃进的巨大动力，决定把这种方法坚持下去，并继续加以发展。
    冬季生产中，群众性的参观评比活动更加丰富多彩了。特别是从去年年底到今年1月上旬进行的一次全县性的参观评比，由于总结推广了去年王家集乡转变的经验，广泛地在评比中采用了快板诗的形式，并且把这些群众就地创作的快板诗用大字公布出来，大大地提高了参观评比的战斗性。这些快板诗，既有表扬，也有批评，还有建议，而且语言生动，容易为群众所接受。例如表扬西城乡飞奔四社的快板诗写道：“行行走，走行行，飞奔四社在眼前。代表仔细来观看，一项一项看得清：油菜好，麦子青，块块丘丘下了粪；锄了草，一片新，沟厢开得齐正正。”对熊家沟建新一社茶山管理的批评和建议的快板诗说：“一上油茶院，靠近一社边，茶树真正广，满山；一亩茶园十亩田，山区潜力胜平原，经营方向不明确，没管；这样好的茶籽山，代表看了都称赞，只怨无人来过问，可怜；代表提意见，快把荒山来改变，应该分配劳动力，专管。”这种快板诗多得很，参观评比的代表们每当看完一乡一社后，纷纷用快板诗发表他们的观感，特别是到那些搞得好和搞得不好的乡、社参观后，快板诗也就创作得特别多。因为快板诗都被贴在最显眼的地方，代表们的批评、表扬立即传遍全乡、全社，影响很大。受到批评的乡、社，立即行动起来克服缺点；受到表扬的乡、社，也积极设法保持光荣。蔡店乡受到批评后，参观代表团刚走，全乡就出动二千人，接连两天两夜内把排剅岗一带的一千多亩三类苗全部追了肥，锄了草，清了沟，使那些三类苗迅速地改变了落后面貌。全县在参观评比后的几天内，日夜突击追肥、锄草和修水利的劳动力，达到十八万人之多。
