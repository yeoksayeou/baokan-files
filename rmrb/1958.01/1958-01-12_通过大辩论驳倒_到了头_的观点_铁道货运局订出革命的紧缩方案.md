Refuting the "Reached the Limit" Argument Through Great Debate
Railway Freight Bureau Formulates Revolutionary Austerity Plan

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Mu Yang reports: The Railway Ministry's Freight Bureau, through a mass debate, has formulated a revolutionary plan for streamlining its organization. The decision has been made to reduce the existing staff from one hundred and nine people to sixty, a reduction of 44.9%.

The Freight Bureau was formed in June 1957 by merging the original Freight and Business Bureaus. Before the merger, the two bureaus had a total of one hundred and twenty-five people; after the merger, this was reduced to one hundred and nine. During the rectification campaign, they formulated a plan to further reduce this to seventy-five people. However, had they already streamlined to the limit? Was there still potential to be tapped? Some people answered this question affirmatively: further streamlining was possible, and they even proposed staffing levels of fifty-two or fifty-four people. The Railway Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group's System Group, based on the opinions of these comrades and in light of various factors, also believed that the staff could be reduced from seventy-five to sixty people.

The Freight Bureau's task is to organize freight transportation, with dispatching work continuing day and night; the work of compiling transportation plans and technical work is also quite busy. According to the seventy-five person staffing plan, they had already reduced the staff by fifty people compared to before the bureaus merged. Now, a plan has been proposed to staff the bureau with sixty people, which has made some people, including some department leaders, feel that it is impossible to achieve. Some people believe that they have repeatedly "carried out revolutions" and that streamlining has "reached the limit"; others believe that arranging work with a staff of seventy-five people is already difficult, and if they have to streamline further, they will just have to "do as much as they can with what they have."

Seventy-five people is not the final number. The administrative leaders of the Freight Bureau were in agreement on this point, but they were not clear enough on how to further streamline. However, some Party members, especially department-level leading cadres, could not accept this for a time; therefore, the bureau's Rectification Leadership Group decided to launch a mass debate across the bureau.

In the initial stage of the debate, especially during the debates within departments, many department-level leading cadres still emphasized the complexity and importance of their department's work, and generally advocated maintaining the seventy-five person staffing level. Although some departments agreed to further streamline, they lacked confidence and determination. A leading comrade from the Planning Department believed that freight planning work was time-sensitive and the workload was originally relatively large. After the abolition of the railway branch bureaus, the workload was even greater, and the department was already working overtime. Further staff reductions would only make things more difficult. But what was the actual situation? During the debate, Ding Guangen and other comrades from the Loading and Unloading Operations Department made a realistic analysis: Although the area for dispatching goods had increased after the abolition of the railway branch bureaus, not every area had goods being shipped to and from each other every month. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the work, some comrades in the Planning Department had to work overtime in the evenings and even on Sundays during the second half of each month to develop the transportation plan for the following month. However, there was not much work during the first half of each month, and those who had worked overtime could take compensatory leave in turn.

A leading comrade from the Freight Operations Department also believed that the freight dispatching platform they managed had to add a platform as the number of management bureaus increased, and the staff could not be reduced. However, everyone believed that the Railway Ministry's dispatching work was different from that of the management bureaus. It was not necessary to understand the freight situation in various places continuously. It was enough to understand the overall situation twice a day at fixed times. For a few key sections with busy transportation tasks that might have problems, further understanding could be made during the remaining time. Therefore, the Freight Operations Department had the conditions to change the three dispatching platforms into two platforms. This could reduce the staff by three to four people.

Of course, it was difficult to get everyone to accept such opinions immediately. To convince the small number of comrades who still had doubts about these opinions, Freight Bureau Director Zhuang Lin, based on the opinions of the masses, randomly checked the freight transportation plan for January 1958 from the Planning Department, proving that the actual number of calculations in the plan only accounted for 60% to 70% of the Planning Department's original estimated number. The Freight Operations Department also used two dispatching platforms to work according to the new method from New Year's Day, and it was progressing smoothly. In the face of the facts, the comrades who originally had doubts completely dispelled their doubts.

It is indeed difficult to reduce staff further for some tasks based on the existing scope of work and work methods, but if the scope of work between upper and lower levels and between left and right is slightly adjusted and the work methods are improved, a large amount of manpower can be saved. This view was also clarified through debate. In the past, the loading and unloading plans and loading and unloading operations for freight transportation were managed separately by the Business Organization and Guidance Department and the Loading and Unloading Operations Department, and the plan management and loading and unloading work were often disjointed. Some people proposed that the two departments should be merged into a Cargo Operations Management Department in the future, which would not only eliminate the disjointed phenomenon, but also reduce the staff from the original twenty-six people to sixteen people. This includes a department director. In the past, no matter how large or small the amount of compensation for freight accidents was, all cases were reported by the management bureaus to the Freight Bureau for approval. In the future, compensation issues within one hundred yuan will be handled by the management bureaus with full authority. The Freight Bureau can reduce one-third of the manpower from this part of the work, and the management bureaus can also save a lot of trouble in reporting and conveying information, and the cargo owners will also be satisfied. For unplanned temporary transportation issues, the Planning Department must have a special person to manage them. This person does not have a grasp of the transportation plans for various goods and cannot answer the cargo owners' questions directly and in a timely manner. If it is handled directly by the person in charge of the transportation plans for classified goods in the future, one person can be reduced, and the problems raised by the cargo owners can also be solved in a timely and accurate manner.

Through such a debate of analyzing the situation, tapping potential, and thinking of solutions, everyone was universally educated and improved their understanding of streamlining institutions. Comrades who originally lacked revolutionary spirit and had conservative ideas also changed their attitudes and worked with everyone to find ways to improve their work. Everyone unanimously agreed that the plan to staff the bureau with sixty people was completely feasible. The Planning Department, which was originally thought to have been streamlined to the limit, could be reduced from the existing twenty-six people to fifteen people.

Now, the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Railways has approved the Freight Bureau's plan to staff the bureau with sixty people. The bureau's Rectification Leadership Group is leading the masses to gradually implement this plan. The Loading and Unloading Operations Department and the Business Organization and Guidance Department have been merged into the Cargo Operations Management Department; the Freight Operations Department has decided to reduce one dispatching platform; and the powers that can be delegated to the management bureaus are being delegated.

### 通过大辩论驳倒“到了头”的观点  铁道货运局订出革命的紧缩方案

    通过大辩论驳倒“到了头”的观点
    铁道货运局订出革命的紧缩方案
    本报讯　记者穆扬报道：铁道部货运局通过群众性的大辩论，订出了革命的紧缩机构方案。决定由现有的一百零九人，减为六十人。减少人员44.9％。
    货运局是在1957年6月间，由原来的货运和商务两局合并成立的。合并前，两局共有一百二十五人；合并后，减为一百零九人。在整改中，他们又订出了再度紧缩为七十五人的方案。但是，是不是已经紧缩到底了呢？还有没有潜力可挖？有一部分人对这个问题作了肯定的答复：还可以紧缩，而且他们还提出了定员五十二人或五十四人的方案。铁道部整风领导小组的体制小组，根据这一部分同志的意见，结合各方面的情况进行了研究，也认为可以从七十五人减少到六十人。
    货运局的任务是组织货物运输，调度工作昼夜不停；编制运输计划的工作和技术性的工作，也相当繁忙。按照七十五人的定员方案，他们已经比合并局前减掉了五十人。现在，又提出了定员为六十人的方案，这就使得一部分人，包括某些处室领导人员，感到无法实现。有人认为，他们已经一再地“革过命了”，紧缩已经“到了头”；也有人认为，按定员七十五人安排工作，已非易事，如果还要紧缩，就只好“有多少人，办多少事”。
    七十五人还不是最后的数字。对于这一点，货运局的几位行政领导同志认识是一致的，但怎样进一步紧缩，思想上还不够明确。而在一部分党员中，特别是处级领导干部中，却一时不能接受；因此，局的整风领导小组便决定发动全局群众进行一次大辩论。
    辩论的最初阶段，特别是在处室内部辩论时，许多处级领导干部，仍然强调本部门工作的复杂性和重要性，一般都主张维持七十五人的定员。有的处虽然同意再度紧缩，但是信心不足，决心不大。计划处的一位领导同志，认为货运计划工作时间性强，工作量原来就比较大，各铁路分局撤消后，工作量更大，处内现在已有加班加点现象，再减人就会更加困难。但是，实际情况究竟怎样呢？在辩论中装卸作业处的丁关根等同志作了实事求是的分析：计划处在各铁路分局撤消后，调度货物划分的区域虽然增加了，但是各区域之间并不是每个月都有相互发到的货物。由于工作的时间性强，计划处在每个月的下半月，为制定下月的运输计划表，有些同志必须晚间加班，甚至星期日也不能休息。但是每个月的上半月工作不多，加过班的人都可以轮流补假。
    货运工作处的一位领导同志也曾认为，他们管理的货运调度台要随着管理局的增加而增设一个台，人员也不能减少。可是大家认为铁道部的调度工作，不同于管理局，它没有必要毫不间断地了解各地货运情况，每天只要定时了解两次全面情况就够了。对于少数运输任务繁忙、可能会发生问题的重点区段，可以在其余的时间里再作了解。因此，货运工作处有条件把三个调度台，改为两个台。这样可以减少三个人到四个人。
    当然，要使所有的人都能马上接受这样的意见是困难的。为了说服对这些意见还有怀疑的一小部分同志，货运局局长庄林根据群众意见，抽查了计划处1958年1月份的货物运输计划表，证明计划表的实际计算次数，只占计划处原估计数字的60％到70％。货运工作处用两个调度台，从元旦日开始按新的方法工作，也进行得很顺利。在事实的面前，原来心怀疑虑的同志，也完全打消了疑虑。
    有些工作，按现有的工作范围和工作方法，再减少人员确有困难，但如果把上下左右之间的工作范围稍加调整，改进工作方法，就可以节省大批人力。这个观点，通过辩论也明确了。货物运输的装卸计划和装卸作业，过去由商务组织指导处和装卸作业处分管，计划管理和装卸工作时常脱节。有人提出，今后两个处合并为货物作业管理处，不但可以消灭脱节现象，还可以由原来的二十六人减为十六人。其中包括一名处长。货运事故的赔偿问题，过去不管赔款数字大小，一律由各管理局报送货运局批办。今后，一百元以内的赔偿问题，交管理局全权处理，货运局可以从原来的这一部分工作中，减少三分之一的人力，各管理局也可省去很多上报下达的麻烦，货主也会满意。计划处，对于计划外的临时运输问题，要专设一人管理。这个人不掌握各种货物的运输计划，就不能及时地直接回答货主的问题。如果今后直接由管货物分类运输计划的人处理，就可以减少一个人，而且还能及时而准确地解决货主提出的问题。
   经过这样分析情况、挖潜力、想办法的辩论，大家普遍受到了教育，提高了对紧缩机构的认识，原来缺乏革命精神有保守思想的同志，也转变了态度，和大家一起想办法改进工作。大家一致认为，定员六十人的方案，是完全可行的。原来认为已经紧缩到顶点了的计划处，就可以由现有的二十六人减少到十五人。
    现在，铁道部党组已经通过货运局定员为六十人的方案。局的整风领导小组，正领导群众逐步实现这个方案。装卸作业处和商务组织指导处，已经合并为货物作业管理处；货运工作处已经决定减少一个调度台；可以下放到管理局去的职权，正在下放。
