    Spanning the North and South of the Pearl River, Connecting the Beijing-Guangzhou and Guangzhou-Sanshui Railways
    Southwest Bridge is under Preparation

    (Our dispatch) Guangzhou—The Southwest Bridge in Guangzhou, which spans the north and south of the Pearl River and connects the Beijing-Guangzhou and Guangzhou-Sanshui Railways, is under active preparation for construction.

    The Southwest Bridge will be a dual-purpose railway and highway bridge across the Pearl River. The entire bridge is divided into east and west sections, with a total length of 500 meters, more than twice the length of the Haizhu Bridge. The bridge body is also relatively high, so that ordinary ships can pass unimpeded at normal water levels.

    As early as 1933, during the rule of Guangdong by the warlord Chen Jitang, preparations were made to build the Southwest Bridge, but after only a few piers were built, work was suspended due to "insufficient funds."

    Since liberation, the economic construction of the Guangzhou area has developed rapidly. In order to meet the needs of industrial development in Guangzhou, especially in the Fangcun area, and the increasingly busy transportation tasks between Guangzhou and the southwest region, the state has decided to build the Southwest Bridge during the Second Five-Year Plan period, with a total investment of approximately 10 million yuan.

    西南大桥正在筹建
    本报讯　横跨珠江南北连接京广、广三铁路的广州西南大桥，正在积极筹建。
    西南大桥将是一座横跨珠江两岸的铁路、公路两用桥。全桥分为东西两段，总长度为五百公尺，比海珠桥长一倍以上。这座桥的桥身也较高，在平常水位时，一般轮船可畅通无阻。
    早在1933年军阀陈济棠统治广东时代，就曾经准备建设西南大桥，可是只建了几个桥墩，就因“工款支绌”而停工。
    解放以来，广州地区的经济建设事业迅速发展，为了适应广州特别是芳村地区工业发展的需要，以及广州与西南地区运输任务日益繁忙的要求，国家决定在第二个五年计划期内兴建西南大桥，全部投资约为一千万元左右。
