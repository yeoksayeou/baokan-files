We fully accept the criticism of us in the People's Daily article "‘Kingdom of Freedom’ - Guanzhuang" published on November 30, 1957. We fully support the State Council's dispatch of a work team to inspect and help us solve the Guanzhuang issue. We must, with revolutionary spirit, thoroughly change the chaotic state of Guanzhuang through rectification and build Guanzhuang into a new Guanzhuang with leadership and order.

The occurrence of the Guanzhuang issue should be considered a serious problem. The Guanzhuang issue shows that our ministry's leadership had subjectivist errors from the very beginning when constructing Guanzhuang. At that time, we only unilaterally considered concentrating the ministry's geological, design, scientific research, and construction units together, which could satisfy the construction land needs, facilitate management, and save investment. We did not anticipate what problems might arise after these units were established, nor did we consider how to strengthen the unified management and cooperation among these units, and how to strengthen the political and ideological leadership work of these units in accordance with socialist principles. On the contrary, we adopted bureaucratic leadership methods for these units. In terms of Party work, we did not establish a unified Party committee in Guanzhuang, but instead assigned the Party organizations of each unit to the Party committee of the ministry's organs and the general branch leadership of the relevant bureaus separately. We did not pay enough attention to the Party organizations and work of each unit, and lacked specific assistance, which weakened the Party's political and ideological leadership work for these units. In terms of administrative work, we handed over each unit to the management of several departments and bureaus within the ministry, resulting in each unit becoming a self-contained system, with each doing its own thing in work and not coordinating with each other. Our ministry's leadership did not take effective measures in time to address these phenomena, and as a result, departmentalism and decentralism grew increasingly serious. In addition, due to the blind expansion of these setups by our ministry's leadership, some were arranged too early, resulting in serious phenomena of bloated organizations and overstaffing. All of these not only brought many difficulties and losses to our work, but also planted the seeds of chaos in Guanzhuang. The rampant spread of bourgeois ideology in the Guanzhuang units was not accidental; it was inseparable from our ministry's leadership's long-term neglect of political and ideological work. Guanzhuang is a place where intellectuals are concentrated. According to statistics from the Cement Industry Design Institute, the Building Materials Industry Design Institute, the Cement Industry Research Institute, and the Building Materials Industry Research Institute, there are a total of 2,574 employees, of which engineering and technical personnel account for about 40% of all employees, and young intellectuals account for the vast majority of all employees. Some of them were deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology in the old society, or had just come out of school and had not experienced class struggle and labor training. This situation shows that if we do not carry out socialist ideological transformation for such a technical team, it is impossible to complete the socialist construction tasks we are undertaking. The Guanzhuang units are undertaking some of the country's geological exploration, design, new product testing and research, and construction and installation tasks, and the work is heavy. Therefore, it is wrong not to pay attention to business, but it is also wrong to only pay attention to business and relax political and ideological work. Our mistake lies in emphasizing business and neglecting politics. In our work, there is often more general guidance and less specific assistance; we rarely conduct inspections of work and ideological situations, or when we do inspect, we see more of the good and less of the bad. When we solve the difficult problems in the work of the Guanzhuang organs, we often only look at the phenomena and not at the essence; we consider material life more and do less political and ideological education work for the employees, and therefore we cannot improve their socialist ideological consciousness and cannot fundamentally solve many problems ideologically. Our mistake of neglecting political and ideological work also seriously exists among some leading cadres and Party members in the Guanzhuang organs. Individual leading cadres in the Guanzhuang organs not only lacked a correct understanding of the meaning of "both red and expert," but also did not implement the Party's cadre policy of "both virtue and talent." Some leading cadres even publicly advocated "technology as the main, politics as the auxiliary" when evaluating wages; some even declared that Party organizations conducting activities during administrative work hours was "illegal," and said that Party work cadres were "political loafers." Under the influence of this erroneous thinking, the tendency of some engineering and technical personnel and young intellectuals to break away from politics and bourgeois ideology has developed even more seriously. For example, some people only want technology and do not want politics, and some even say, "I will not do it if you ask me to spend time on politics," believing that technology is an "iron rice bowl" and that "with technology, you have everything." Some people regard studying technology as a means of pursuing personal fame and fortune; they "do not hear anything outside the window and only read books on business." Even the Communist Youth League organizations in some units have so-called "absorb all people with technology into the League" statements when developing League members. In some Party organizations, the political atmosphere is thin, criticism and self-criticism are not carried out, there is a lack of courage to struggle against unhealthy tendencies, and even the phenomenon of a small number of Party members being uninterested in political struggle and organizational life is quite serious.

The development of the chaotic phenomenon in Guanzhuang is directly related to the right-leaning thinking of our ministry's leadership. In the process of establishing and expanding institutions, we not only lacked foresight, but also lacked a high degree of political vigilance. We did not conduct strict political reviews of the personnel we recruited, which allowed a small number of hooligans, thieves, and counter-revolutionaries to mix in, causing serious impurity within the organs. In addition, some political movements in the past were not thorough enough, and the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries and those who violated laws and disciplines was not strong enough and the punishments were not severe enough, so they became even more unscrupulous in doing whatever they wanted. For example, in hundreds of theft cases, there were disguised engineers and senior intellectuals committing crimes, and there were daytime thefts. As for the activities of hooligans, they were even more lawless, and some even dared to insult women in public places, and even cases of raping young girls occurred. Our ministry's leadership has long lacked sufficient understanding of this serious situation, and even believed that: with more people, the situation will inevitably be complicated, and it is inevitable that there will be both good and bad, so counter-revolutionaries and those who violated laws and disciplines were not promptly and resolutely dealt with seriously; some, although they were dealt with, were also too lenient; and there were also some problems in handling them that were tolerant and accommodating. It is precisely because of our right-leaning thinking that the socialist order in Guanzhuang has been seriously damaged.

In the past, although we also knew some of the Guanzhuang problems, we did not go deep into the lower levels and grasp the essence of the problem for serious handling. Even when the leaders of the Guanzhuang units reflected on the difficulties in their work, we did not adopt an attitude of listening humbly and studying carefully, but often pushed the responsibility to the lower-level departmentalism. After the People's Daily publicly exposed the situation of the "Kingdom of Freedom," although it began to attract our attention, we still did not have enough understanding of the seriousness of the problem. Even after the State Council sent a work team to go deep into Guanzhuang, we still did not send the main responsible cadres to Guanzhuang to carry out rectification, and we did not even consider checking the responsibilities that our ministry's leadership should bear from the occurrence of the Guanzhuang problem and drawing lessons from it. Instead, we only believed that: the ministry has already transferred a bureau director and a cadre specializing in Party work to form a Design Administration Bureau and establish a unified Party committee to lead Guanzhuang during the rectification process, which can solve the Guanzhuang problem. This attitude is obviously not serious enough, and it is also a manifestation of our lack of political sensitivity and responsibility. It should be admitted that the reason why Guanzhuang formed a "Kingdom of Freedom" is that our ministry's leadership committed serious subjectivism, bureaucracy, and serious right-leaning ideological errors. That is to say, after we blindly set up organs of tens of thousands of people (including family members) in Guanzhuang, we did not take the necessary measures to strengthen the Party's leadership and unified administrative management of these units, and seriously neglected political and ideological work; in addition, some criminal elements and those who violated laws and disciplines in these units were not promptly and severely dealt with, so the Guanzhuang problem became more and more serious, and was finally exposed in this rectification movement. My speech at the first meeting of the Guanzhuang organ staff representatives without self-criticism was wrong. The Guanzhuang problem has caused a bad influence among the people, damaged the prestige of the Party and the government among the people, and brought many losses to our work. It should be said that I am primarily responsible for these errors.

The Guanzhuang issue profoundly taught us: wherever Party leadership is relaxed and there is serious bureaucracy, there will inevitably be disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchic states, and there will inevitably be illegal and undisciplined behaviors. The Guanzhuang issue also taught us: political and ideological work is the soul of all work. The facts in Guanzhuang powerfully demonstrate that any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology means a strengthening of the influence of bourgeois ideology. It also proves that any business work, if not closely combined with political and ideological work, cannot be completed well, and will inevitably bring incalculable losses to our cause.

There are many shortcomings and errors in the leadership of our Ministry of Building Materials Industry, and the Guanzhuang issue is a concentrated exposure of our shortcomings and errors. Our current main task is to vigorously strengthen political and ideological work, concentrate our efforts on solving the Guanzhuang issue, and list this issue as one of the key points of the rectification movement. We must mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and conscientiously carry out an in-depth rectification movement among the Guanzhuang organ staff, strengthen rectification with revolutionary spirit, and persevere to the end. And through rectification, we will effectively rectify the organization, overcome the phenomenon of bloated organizations and overstaffing, so that our organizational structure and work system can better adapt to the needs of national construction tasks. In order to strengthen the leadership of the Party's work in the Guanzhuang units, we must establish a unified Party committee in Guanzhuang. The Guanzhuang Organ Party Committee, in addition to being led by the Party Committee of the higher-level organ, must also obey the leadership of the local Party Committee, and conscientiously implement the instructions of the local Party Committee. In order to overcome the phenomena of departmentalism and decentralism in which each goes its own way and does not cooperate with each other, we must immediately establish a unified administrative management institution to strengthen the unified management of the administrative work of the Guanzhuang units. At the same time, we must launch a struggle against waste, so that all employees can receive a profound education in building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and doing everything with diligence and thrift, and establish a good style of hard work and simplicity. In order to eliminate the chaotic phenomena in Guanzhuang, we must also launch a mass struggle against various criminal elements and illegal and undisciplined behaviors in Guanzhuang. Through this struggle, we will resolutely crack down on saboteurs and protect good people. At the same time, we will strengthen the socialist ideological education of employees and improve their political awareness. We must educate every national organ staff member and their families in Guanzhuang to obey the leadership of the local government, conscientiously implement the government's policies and decrees, closely contact the masses, and actively participate in the activities of the local people. Our national cadres and staff family members are all ordinary citizens in the local area, and do not have any special rights.

Finally, I believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and through our own efforts, the Guanzhuang issue will definitely be completely resolved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    关于“自由王国”——管庄问题的检讨
    建筑材料工业部部长　赖际发
    我们完全接受人民日报1957年11月30日发表的“‘自由王国’——管庄”一文对我们 的批评；我们完全拥护国务院派工作组来检查和帮助我们解决管庄问题；我们必须以革命的精神，通过整风，坚决彻底地改变管庄的混乱状态，把管庄建设成一个有领导、有秩序的新管庄。
    管庄问题的发生，应该认为是一个严重的问题。管庄问题，说明我们部的领导上一开始在管庄进行建设的时候，就存在着主观主义的错误。当时我们只是片面地考虑到把部属的地质、设计、科学研究和施工等单位集中设在一起，既可以满足建设用地，又便于管理、节省投资，而没有估计到这些单位建立以后，可能会发生一些什么问题，也没有很好地考虑到如何加强这些单位的统一管理和互相之间的协作，以及如何按照社会主义的原则，加强这些单位的政治思想领导工作。相反地，我们对这些单位却采取了官僚主义的领导方法。在党的工作方面，我们没有在管庄成立统一的党委，而是把各单位的党组织分头划归部的机关党委和有关局的总支领导；我们对于各单位党的组织和工作关心不够，缺乏具体的帮助，这就削弱了党对这些单位的政治思想领导工作。在行政工作方面，我们把各单位分头交给部内的几个司、局管理，致使各单位自成系统，工作上各搞一套，互不协调。对于这些现象，我们部的领导上没有及时地采取有效措施，结果本位主义、分散主义也就日益严重地滋长起来了。另外，由于我们部的领导上盲目地把这些摊子铺的很大，有些摆的过早，因此造成了机构臃
        肿、人浮于事的严重现象。所有这些，不仅给我们的工作带来了很多的困难和损失，而且也给管庄种下了混乱的根子。管庄各单位资产阶级思想影响的泛滥，不是偶然的，这是同我们部的领导上长期忽视政治思想工作分不开的。管庄是一个知识分子成堆的地方。根据水泥工业设计院、建筑材料工业设计院、水泥工业研究院、建筑材料工业研究院四个单位的统计，共有职工二千五百七十四人，其中工程技术人员约占全体职工的40％左右，青年知识分子又占全体职工的绝大多数。他们中间有些人在旧社会里受资产阶级思想的影响很深，或者是刚从学校出来不久，没有经过阶级斗争和劳动锻炼。这种情况说明，对于这样一支技术队伍，如果不进行社会主义的思想改造，要完成我们所担负的社会主义建设任务是不可能的。管庄各单位担负着国家的部分地质勘探、设计、新产品试验研究和建筑安装等项任务，工作是繁重的。因此，不抓业务是不对的，但是只抓业务，而放松政治思想工作也是不对的。而我们的错误就在于偏重了业务，忽视了政治。在我们的工作中，常常是一般指导多，具体帮助少；很少进行工作和思想情况的检查，或者检查的时候也是看好的多，看坏的少。我们在解决管庄机关工作中的困难问题时，往往只看现象，不看本质；从物质生活上考虑的多，而对职工群众的政治思想教育工作做的少，因而也就不能提高他们的社会主义思想觉悟，不能使许多问题从思想上求得根本的解决。我们这种忽视政治思想工作的错误，在管庄机关的一些领导干部和党员中也严重地存在着。管庄机关的个别领导干部，不仅对“又红又专”的意义缺乏正确的理解，而且也没有贯彻执行党的“德才兼备”的干部政策，甚至有的领导干部在评定工资时公开主张“以技术为主，政治为辅”；有的还竟然宣称：党组织在行政工作时间进行活动是“非法”的，说党的工作干部是“政治二流子”。在这种错误思想影响之下，一些工程技术人员和青年知识分子脱离政治的倾向和资产阶级思想，也就更加严重地发展起来了。例如有些人只要技术，不要政治，有的人竟说：“让我拿时间来搞政治我是不干的”，认为技术是“铁饭碗”，“有了技术就有了一切”。有些人把钻研技术当成了追求个人名利的一种手段，他们是“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书”。甚至有的单位的团组织，在发展团员的时候，也有所谓“把一切有技术的人都吸收到团内来”的说法。在某些党的组织中，政治空气稀薄，批评和自我批评不开展，对不良倾向缺乏斗争的勇气，甚至少数党员对政治斗争和组织生活不感兴趣的现象，也相当严重。
    管庄混乱现象的发展，同我们部的领导上的右倾思想有直接关系。我们在建立和扩大机构的过程中，不仅存在着盲目性，而且缺乏高度的政治警觉性。我们对招收来的人员没有进行严格的政治审查，使少数流氓分子、盗窃分子和反革命分子混了进来，造成了机关内部的严重不纯。加上过去的一些政治运动搞得不够彻底，对于反革命分子、违法乱纪分子打击不力，处理不严，因此他们就更加肆无忌惮地为所欲为。例如在几百件盗窃案件中，有伪装的工程师和高级知识分子作案，有白天行窃的勾当。至于流氓分子的活动，更是无法无天，有的竟敢在公开场所侮辱妇女，甚至强奸幼女的案件也有发生。对于这种严重的情况，我们部的领导上长期以来缺乏足够的认识，甚至认为：人员多了情况不免复杂，良莠不齐在所难免，因而对反革命分子和违法乱纪分子，就没有及时地、坚决地进行严肃处理；有的虽然处理了，也失之过宽；也还有些问题在处理上存在着姑息迁就的错误。正是由于我们存在着这种右倾思想，使管庄的社会主义秩序遭到了严重的破坏。
    管庄问题，以往我们虽然也知道一些情况，但是我们并没有深入下层，抓住本质的问题进行认真的处理。甚至当管庄各单位的领导人员反映工作上的困难时，我们不是采取虚心听取、仔细研究的态度，而是往往把责任推到下面的本位主义方面。人民日报公开揭发“自由王国”的情况以后，虽然开始引起了我们的注意，但是对于这个问题的严重性却仍然认识不够。直到国务院派了工作组深入管庄之后，我们也还没有派出主要负责干部去管庄进行整顿，更没有考虑到从管庄问题的发生来检查我们部的领导所应当负的责任，并且从中吸取教训，而只是认为：部里在整风过程中已经抽调一名局长和专做党的工作的干部，成立设计管理局，建立统一领导管庄的党委，就可以解决管庄的问题，这种态度显然是不够严肃的，也是我们在政治上缺乏敏感性和责任心的表现。应该承认，管庄之所以形成“自由王国”，是由于我们部的领导上犯了严重的主观主义，官僚主义和严重脱离政治的右倾思想错误。这就是说，我们盲目地把上万人（包括家属）的机关设在管庄以后，没有采取必要的措施去加强这些单位的党的领导和行政的统一管理，严重地忽视了政治思想工作；再加上对这些单位中的一些刑事犯罪分子和违法乱纪分子没有及时地严肃处理，因而就使管庄问题越来越加严重，终于在这次整风运动中暴露了出来。我在管庄第一次机关职工代表会议上的讲话，没有进行自我批评是错误的。管庄问题已在人民群众中造成了不良的影响，损害了党和政府在人民群众中的威信，给工作带来了不少损失。应该说，这些错误我是要负主要责任的。
    管庄问题，深刻地教训了我们：凡是放松党的领导，存在着严重官僚主义的地方，就必然会产生无组织、无纪律、无政府状态，就必然会发生违法乱纪的行为。管庄问题，还教训了我们：政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂。管庄的事实有力地说明了：社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都意味着资产阶级思想影响的加强。同时也证明了：任何一项业务工作，如果不同政治思想工作密切结合起来，就不可能很好地完成任务，就必然给我们的事业带来无可估量的损失。
    我们建筑材料工业部领导上的缺点和错误是很多的，管庄问题是我们的缺点和错误的一次集中暴露。我们当前的主要任务，就是大力加强政治思想工作，集中力量解决管庄问题，把这个问题列为整风运动的重点之一。我们必须发动群众，依靠群众，在管庄机关工作人员中，认真开展一个深入的整风运动，以革命的精神，加强整改，坚持到底。并且通过整改，切实整顿组织，克服机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象，使我们的组织机构和工作制度能够更好地适应国家建设任务的需要。为了加强管庄各单位党的工作的领导，我们必须在管庄建立统一的党委。管庄机关党委除了受上级机关党委的领导以外，同时还必须服从地方党委的领导，认真贯彻执行地方党委的指示。为了克服各自为政、互不协作的本位主义、分散主义的现象，我们必须立即建立统一的行政管理机构，加强对管庄各单位行政工作的统一管理。与此同时，我们还必须开展一个反对浪费的斗争，使全体职工群众受到一次勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的深刻教育，树立艰苦朴素的优良作风。为了消灭管庄的混乱现象，我们还必须在管庄开展一个群众性的反对各种刑事犯罪分子和违法乱纪行为的斗争，通过这个斗争，坚决打击破坏分子，使好人得到保护。同时，加强对职工群众的社会主义思想教育，提高他们的政治觉悟。我们必须教育管庄的每一个国家机关工作人员及其家属，服从当地政府的领导，认真执行政府的政策、法令，密切联系群众，积极参加当地人民群众的活动。我们的国家干部和工作人员家属，在当地都是普通公民，并没有任何特殊的权利。
    最后，我相信在党中央和国务院的领导下，经过我们自己的努力，管庄的问题，一定可以得到彻底的解决。　（新华社）
