Nanjing, January 1st (Our Dispatch) - Nanjing, a city once recognized as a national model of sanitation, is currently engaged in a large-scale and unprecedented patriotic health campaign. All 600,000 people in the city's urban area have joined the battle to eliminate the four pests. Every household and every street is greeting the new year of 1958 with a completely new look.

Nanjing's winter patriotic health campaign, after a full mobilization in mid-December of last year, immediately launched into the first wave of concentrated effort, focusing on the elimination of mosquitoes and flies. Due to the personal involvement of the First Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and responsible cadres at all levels, and the adoption of the method of "every unit mobilize, every sector leads," the previous phenomenon of "residents actively participate, cadres are slack" was changed, and all organs, factories, schools, and residents of the city were mobilized. Therefore, the first wave came with great momentum and energy. By the 28th of last month, more than 80% of the residents in the urban area had carried out a thorough clean-up with one to three rounds of major indoor relocation. More than 9,200 cesspools and toilets in the entire urban area had been thoroughly dug once to eliminate fly pupae. According to incomplete statistics on the 26th, 48 catties of mosquitoes, 112 catties of flies, and 2,700 catties of pupae had been eliminated; more than 138,300 rats and nearly 20,000 sparrows had been captured; and more than 36,000 dan of garbage had been cleared.

During the first wave of concentrated effort to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, the People's Liberation Army and the cadres, workers, students, and residents of various organs, factories, and schools played a significant role. Regardless of the level of their organ or the type of their factory, they all formed thousands of shock brigades together with residents under the unified leadership of the local street offices, assigning responsibilities and contracting tasks to carry out large-scale cleaning work. Leaders of 20 units, including a motor vehicle company of a certain PLA unit, the Radio Industry School, and the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, led nearly 10,000 people, not only cleaning all the major streets and public places with residents, but also actively participating in digging fly pupae. More than 100 cadres of the East China Branch of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry dug fly pupae around more than 800 cesspools in Guanghua Gate. Chen Liping, Vice Mayor of Nanjing, introduced experience and encouraged the surrounding masses while digging fly pupae by the cesspool. On the 26th, more than 100 shock brigades in Qinhuai District eliminated more than 200 catties of fly pupae and cleared 18 tons of garbage and sludge. The streets and alleys were also cleaned thoroughly. During this concentrated effort, the masses also used the form of big-character posters to supervise and promote each other. Near the Wulaocun, a national first-class health model unit, there was a slaughterhouse with poor sanitation. The residents of Wulaocun beat gongs and drums and posted a big-character poster on the gate of the slaughterhouse, saying: "We are vigorously carrying out sanitation work, and you are creating bacteria." The leaders of the slaughterhouse accepted the residents' opinions and carried out a thorough clean-up. Under the slogan of "Move well, wash cleanly, and arrange neatly," every household moved and cleaned large and small items, and captured and killed residual mosquitoes and flies. Yao, a 76-year-old woman on Huaihai Road, had not moved her bed for 30 years. In this "major relocation," she also personally moved the bed and carried out a thorough cleaning.

The city-wide campaign is still continuing. The Municipal People's Committee requires all districts to carry out three more concentrated campaigns with different content before the Spring Festival: organize forces to attack all mosquito and fly overwintering places and breeding grounds; carry out a large-scale publicity and inspection campaign; and carry out another large-scale indoor and outdoor clean-up and personal hygiene activities. The goal of the campaign is to strive to achieve a "fly-free city" in 1958 and become a "four-without" city by 1962. This goal has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the masses. Lu Dama, a national first-class health model who is at the forefront, has proposed the initiative to strive to turn her area into a "four-without" area in 1958. This initiative has been immediately responded to by various districts. 117 neighborhood committees in Qinhuai and Gulou districts have accepted the challenge.

    条条动员　块块领导　居民积极　干部带头
    南京六十万人痛歼四害
    争取1958年成为无蝇城　1962年成为四无城
    本报南京1日电　曾被评为全国卫生模范的南京市，目前正在开展一个声势浩大、规模空前的爱国卫生运动，全市城区已有六十万人民投入了除四害战斗。家家户户、大街小巷都以焕然一新的面貌，迎接新的1958年。
    南京市的冬季爱国卫生运动，自去年12月中旬全面动员后，立即卷入了以消灭蚊蝇为主的第一个突击浪潮。由于中共南京市委第一书记和各级党政负责干部亲自动手，并采取了“条条动员、块块领导”的方法，改变了以往“居民积极，干部松劲”的现象，把全市所有的机关、工厂、学校和居民全部发动了起来。因此第一个浪头就来势勇猛，劲头很大，到上月28日为止，城区80％以上的居民都进行了一次到三次的室内大搬家的彻底大扫除，全城区九千二百多处粪坑、厕所已彻底地挖过一次蝇蛹。据26日不完全统计，已灭蚊四十八斤，灭蝇一百一十二斤，灭蛹二千七百斤，捕获老鼠十三万八千三百多只，麻雀近二万只，清除垃圾三万六千余担。
    在第一个歼灭蚊蝇的突击浪潮中，解放军及各机关、工厂、学校的干部、工人、学生和居民一起，发挥了很大的力量。他们不论是哪一级机关，哪一类工厂，都在当地街道办事处统一领导下，和居民一起组成上千个突击队，分工包干，展开了规模巨大的清扫工作。解放军某部汽车连、无线电工业学校、南京机床厂等二十个单位负责人率领了近万人，不仅和居民一起把几条大街和公共场所全部清扫干净，很多干部、学生还积极参加挖蝇蛹。冶金工业部地质局华东分局的百余干部，分头在光华门的八百多个粪坑旁挖蝇蛹。南京市副市长陈立平一边在粪坑边挖蝇蛹，一边还介绍经验，向周围群众做鼓动工作。秦淮区一百多个突击队26日一天灭蝇蛹两百多斤，清除垃圾和污泥十八吨。大街小巷也打扫得干干净净。在这次突击中群众还采用大字报的形式，互相督促推动。全国甲等卫生模范单位五老村附近有个屠宰场，卫生工作搞得差，五老村的居民就敲锣打鼓，把大字报贴在屠宰场门上说：“我们轰轰烈烈搞卫生，你们制造细菌”。场领导上接受居民的意见，彻底地进行了一次大扫除。在“搬得好，洗得清，摆得齐”的口号下，家家户户做到大小物件搬家清扫，捕打残蚊残蝇。淮海路七十六岁姚老太的床铺，三十年没有搬动过。在这次“大搬家”中，她也亲自动手，搬动了床铺，进行了彻底大扫除。
    现在全市的运动还在继续，市人民委员会要求各区在春节前再搞三个内容不同的突击运动：组织力量向一切蚊蝇越冬场所和蚊蝇孳生地进攻；开展一次大规模宣传检查运动；再进行一次室内外大清扫和个人卫生活动。运动的目标是争取1958年实现“无蝇城”，到1962年成为“四无”城市。这个奋斗目标，大大鼓舞了群众的热情。走在最前面的全国甲等卫生模范鲁大妈，已提出了争取1958年将她所在地区变为“四无”地区的倡议，这个倡议立即得到各区响应，秦淮、鼓楼二区已有一百一十七个居民委员会应了战。
