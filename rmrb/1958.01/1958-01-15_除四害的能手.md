In the patriotic health campaign of "Eliminating the Four Pests and Emphasizing Hygiene" carried out in various places, a large number of activists and experts in eliminating the four pests have emerged. They not only do everything possible to fight against the four pests themselves, but also actively lead the masses to eliminate the four pests. The following are some deeds of these activists.

Turning Stinky Street into a Model Hygienic Street

Li Daoying, a sixty-two-year-old resident committee deputy director of Miao Street in Hefei City, learned and created more than a dozen rat-catching methods in her rat-catching work, such as smoking rat holes, bottle traps, and flooding, and promoted them among the masses. All the two hundred and seventy households in this residents' committee took action to eliminate the four pests and achieved great results. From 1953 to the end of November 1957, Li Daoying caught more than 5,000 rats and eliminated a large number of fly pupae. The masses caught more than 3,400 rats and eliminated a large number of flies, so that mosquitoes and flies were basically eliminated on Miao Street, and sparrows were rarely seen. Li Daoying also often helped neighbors clean up their homes, improve toilets, dredge sewers, and formulate a system for checking and cleaning up hygiene, turning the "Stinky Street" where garbage was piled up and dirty water overflowed into a model hygienic street. Li Daoying has been awarded more than a dozen times in recent years.

An Old Clerk Who Hates Flies

Cha Chengli, a sixty-four-year-old clerk of the Preparatory Committee of the Yanziji District Branch of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, extremely hates flies. According to his long-term observation of the fly activity pattern, he used fly traps to catch flies. He set up the traps around 10:00 AM every day, added bait again around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and collected the traps around 5:00 PM in the afternoon. Each trap could kill hundreds or thousands of flies every day. Since 1956, he has killed flies totaling more than 300 jin. He was once named an advanced activist in eliminating the four pests in Nanjing. Recently, he has been commended by relevant departments in Yanziji District.

New Plans of a Rat-Catching Expert

Wang Zhixian, a rat-catching expert and activist in eliminating the four pests in Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, recently made a rat-catching plan, intending to catch another 36,000 rats in the next five years. Wang Zhixian is an oiler in a dyeing and weaving factory. In the past two years, Wang Zhixian has gone to places such as Outang Township, Anshi Township, and Qianxi Township to mobilize farmers to catch more than 17,000 rats. Together with the rats he caught in the four years before 1955, he has caught a total of 64,900 rats.

Every Sunday, he got up early and went to the countryside to organize farmers to catch rats, and did not return until dark. He had never interrupted this for six years. When it snowed or rained, he was even more enthusiastic, knowing that rats hid at home to find food and were easy to catch.

Training Sparrow-Catching Skills

Cheng Falin, a member of the Baota Agricultural Cooperative in Pukou District, Nanjing City, has caught more than 9,000 sparrows since the late October of last year. Together with those caught in 1956, the total number of sparrows caught in two years is about 13,000.

Cheng Falin's sparrow-catching technique is passed down from his family. He started learning to catch sparrows from his father at the age of seventeen, and now has twenty-five years of experience. Cheng Falin told reporters: Sparrows lay eggs after the Beginning of Spring every year, so it is difficult to catch them in large numbers. During the one and a half months from Cold Dew to Minor Snow, sparrows fly in groups near villages to forage for food, which is the easiest time to catch them in large quantities. After the Frost's Descent last year, he took eighteen days to set up nets in the fields near the villages, casting one or twenty nets every day, and never missed a net. The most he caught in a day was 975.

Now the Baota Agricultural Cooperative plans to purchase another ten sparrow nets, and Cheng Falin will train a group of sparrow catchers to launch a large-scale sparrow-catching campaign.

A Female Cooperative Member Who Persists in Rat-Catching for Five Years

Zhang Jinkou, forty-eight years old, is a female member of the Changfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province. In the past five years, she has used various rat traps to catch more than 3,370 house rats, averaging two rats a day. Her son helped her imitate the ferret trap and made a rat trap out of yellow mud. She caught three rats the first night with this rat trap. In order to catch rats, she thought of many methods and tricks, often paying attention to the activity pattern of rats, listening to the sound of rats at night when others were asleep, and carefully observing the routes of rats during the day. Later, she almost always caught rats with a hundred percent success rate.

Zhang Jinkou not only catches rats in her own home, but also enthusiastically helps neighbors catch rats and encourages others to actively catch rats. Now, almost every household in the bay where she lives has one or two rat traps. Her two sons have now become rat-catching experts.

Heng Yongfeng, a noodle worker in Chongqing, is an active rat catcher. Last year, he caught more than 3,500 rats. Regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, Heng Yongfeng went out to catch rats every day after finishing work. Sometimes he caught more than thirty rats a day, and he would not stop his rat-catching activity for the day until he had caught at least ten rats. Heng Yongfeng handed over the rats he caught every day to the seventy-five-year-old Dragon, a street health committee member who was enthusiastic about eliminating the four pests, to record the numbers.

    除四害的能手
    在各地开展“除四害讲卫生”的爱国卫生运动中，涌现了大批积极分子和消灭四害的能手。他们不仅自己千方百计地同四害作斗争，而且积极带动群众消灭四害。下面就是这些积极分子的一些事迹。
  把臭人街变成卫生模范街
    合肥市庙街居民委员会副主任，六十二岁的李道英老太太，在捕鼠工作中学习和创造用烟熏鼠洞、瓶诱、水淹等十几种捕鼠办法，并且在群众中推广。这个居民委员会二百七十多户人家，人人动手消灭四害，获得很大成绩。从1953年至1957年11月底统计，李道英捕鼠五千多只，消灭了大量蝇蛹。群众捕鼠三千四百多只，和消灭大量苍蝇，使庙街基本上消灭了蚊蝇，麻雀也很少见到。李道英还经常帮助邻居家打扫卫生，改善厕所，疏通阴沟，制订检查和打扫卫生的制度，把垃圾成堆、脏水四溢的“臭人街”，变成讲卫生模范街。李道英几年来连续荣获十几次奖励。
    厌恶苍蝇的老工务员
    南京市工商联合会燕子矶区分会筹委会工务员六十四岁的查成礼，极端厌恶苍蝇。根据他长期观察苍蝇活动规律，用蝇笼捕蝇，每天在上午十时前后安笼，中间在下午2时前后再添放一次食饵，下午5时前后收笼，每只笼子每天可以捕杀成百上千的苍蝇。1956年以来，他打苍蝇累计重三百多斤。他曾被评为南京市除四害的先进积极分子。最近又受到燕子矶区有关方面的表扬。
      捕鼠能手的新打算
    浙江省金华市除四害积极分子——捕鼠能手汪志贤在最近订出一个捕鼠计划，打算在今后五年内争取再捕三万六千只老鼠。汪志贤是染织厂的加油工人。两年来，汪志贤曾到藕塘乡、安狮乡、乾西乡等地发动农民捕鼠一万七千多只，加上他在1955年以前四年中所捕的老鼠，共有六万四千九百多只。
    他每到星期天就起早下乡组织农民捕鼠，到天黑才回来，六年来从未间断过，碰到下雪下雨天，他的劲头更大，知道老鼠躲在家里找食吃容易捕获。
      训练捕雀本领
    南京市浦口区宝塔农业社社员成发林，去年10月下旬后已捉到九千多只麻雀，连同1956年捉到的在内，两年捉雀总数约有一万三千多只。
    成发林捉麻雀的技术是家传的，他从十七岁开始跟父亲学捉雀，到现在已有二十五年的经验。成发林对记者说：麻雀习性，每年立春后卵雏，大批捕捉较困难。从寒露到小雪的一个半月中，麻雀在村旁附近群飞觅食，这时候最易大量捕捉。他去年霜降后抽空打了十八天，在村落附近田里安网，每天打一、二十网，网网不落空，最多的一天曾捉住九百七十五只。
    现在宝塔农业社准备再置十副雀网，由成发林训练一批捉雀手，开展大规模的捕雀运动。
  坚持五年捕鼠活动的女社员
    四十八岁的张金扣是湖北省孝感县长凤农业生产合作社的女社员。五年来她先后用各种捕鼠器已捕打了三千三百七十多只家鼠，平均每天打鼠两只。她儿子帮助她仿照捕黄鼠的关箱用黄泥巴做成一个捕鼠器，她用这种捕鼠器第一晚就捕了三只老鼠。为了捕鼠，她想了许多办法和窍门，经常注意老鼠的活动规律，晚上别人睡了她还在倾听老鼠的响声在什么地方，白天细心地观察老鼠来去路线。到后来她捕老鼠几乎是百发百中。
    张金扣不仅捕自己家里的老鼠，而且热情帮助邻居捕鼠，动员别人也积极捕鼠。现在，她所在的那个湾子，差不多家家户户都有一、两件捕鼠器。她的两个儿子现在也成为捕鼠能手了。

    重庆市切面工人衡永丰是个捕捉老鼠的积极分子，去年一年捕到了三千五百多只。衡永丰不管天晴或下雨，每天在工作完毕之后都要出去捕鼠，有时一天要捕三十多只，一般也要捕到十只，他才肯停止一天的捕鼠活动。衡永丰把每天捉到的老鼠，交给热心除四害工作的街道卫生委员七十五岁的龙老太太记下数字。　新华社记者　刘诗临摄
