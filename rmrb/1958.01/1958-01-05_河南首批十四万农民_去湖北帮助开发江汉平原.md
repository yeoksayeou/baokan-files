    Henan's First Group of 140,000 Farmers
    To Help Develop the Jianghan Plain in Hubei

    (Our newspaper reports) Farmers from Shangqiu, Nanyang, Kaifeng and other areas of Henan Province are actively responding to the Party's call and are heading to Hubei Province to support the development of the Jianghan Plain. The first group of 140,000 people will all arrive at the construction site by mid-January.

    Hubei Province is one of the key areas for expanding agricultural bases in our country. The province has already surveyed 14 million mu of wasteland, of which more than 7 million mu are mostly distributed in the Jianghan Plain, where rivers and lakes intersect, the soil is fertile, and transportation is convenient. Hubei Province has decided to vigorously build state-owned mechanized farms on this wasteland during the Second Five-Year Plan period. In 1958, it was decided to build and expand 42 new mechanized farms and reclaim 1.2 million mu of wasteland. In order to complete the above tasks, Hubei Province requested support from Henan due to insufficient labor. Of this group of Henan farmers going to the Jianghan Plain, 30,000 will settle permanently in Hubei Province to serve as agricultural workers; more than 110,000 are temporary workers, participating in the construction of water conservancy, transportation, and other projects for the farms. The families of the permanent workers will also be relocated to Hubei in batches. (Zhang Dong)

    河南首批十四万农民
    去湖北帮助开发江汉平原
    本报讯　河南省商丘、南阳、开封等地区的农民，积极响应党的号召，正前往湖北省支援江汉平原的开发工作。第一批十四万人，1月中旬可全部到达工地。
    湖北省是我国当前扩展农业基地的重点之一。全省已经过勘测的荒地达一千四百万亩，其中七百余万亩大多分布在河湖交错、土质肥沃、交通便利的江汉平原上。湖北省决定在第二个五年计划期间，在这片荒地上大力兴建国营机械农场。1958年内，决定新建、扩建四十二个机械农场和开荒一百二十万亩。为完成上述任务，湖北省因劳力不足，曾要求河南予以支援。这一批河南农民去到江汉平原，其中有三万人将在湖北省长期安家落户，充当农业工人；有十一万余人是临时工，参加农场的水利、交通等建设。长期工人的家属，也将分批迁到湖北定居。　（章栋）
