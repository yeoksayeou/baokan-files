Island Nations of the Western Hemisphere

The West Indies Federation, also known as the Caribbean Federation, is composed of a group of British-owned islands scattered in the Caribbean Sea within the West Indies, with a total of thirteen main islands. This newly established country is the smallest in the Americas, with a total area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers, equivalent to half the area of Switzerland. The largest island, Jamaica, accounts for more than half of the total area.

In the 1490s, Columbus arrived in the Caribbean Sea and discovered America. Following him, Spanish colonists established colonies on the numerous islands of the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea. Later, the Spanish colonial empire declined. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Britain began to occupy the islands that make up today's West Indies Federation. The remaining parts of the West Indies were successively divided up by France, the Netherlands, and the United States. Originally, over a million indigenous people with ancient cultures inhabited the entire West Indies, but almost all of them were killed by the colonizers' fire and sword. Colonialists brought millions of black people from Africa to work as laborers, and the descendants of these black people and people of mixed black and white race constitute the main ethnic groups of the West Indies today. Europeans, on the other hand, account for only a very small percentage; for example, in Jamaica, with a population of 1.5 million, Europeans make up less than 1%.

Britain implemented a long period of dark colonial rule in the West Indies region it occupied. It established governors in various regions, stationed colonial rulers, and established so-called "autonomous" institutions, hoping to continue exploiting and enslaving the West Indies people. However, in recent years, the national and democratic movements of the West Indies people have been surging. In 1951, agricultural workers on the island of Grenada, with a population of only 80,000, held a large-scale strike. In 1953 and 1956, workers in Jamaica held multiple strikes. British imperialists have continuously carried out brutal armed suppression. Since the end of World War II, Britain has sent troops to the West Indies six times to suppress strikes and progressive organizations. However, these high-pressure measures of the British colonizers cannot extinguish the fighting will and activities of the West Indies people.

In recent years, the United States' infiltration into the British West Indies has also been deepening, with large amounts of American capital pouring into the region. American companies have already controlled Jamaica's bauxite and bought up the largest British oil company on Trinidad Island – Trinidad Oil Company. The United States had already obtained the right to establish military bases in the British West Indies during World War II. The United States also uses the "Caribbean Commission" (later joined by France and the Netherlands), which it had jointly established with Britain long ago, as a powerful tool to exclude Britain under its control.

In order to attempt to maintain its colonial interests and deal with the United States' encroachment, Britain proposed the idea of forming a British West Indies Federation as early as 1947. In April 1953, the first conference to prepare for the federation was held in London; in February 1956, a second conference to prepare for the federation was held in London. Later, the British Parliament passed the British Caribbean Federation Act in August 1956, stipulating that the federation was "the first step towards independent, self-governing dominion status." Last August, the British Colonial Office stated that the West Indies Federation was scheduled to be formally established in January 1958. Now, the West Indies Federation has been declared established. This step is undoubtedly a sign that Britain's colonial rule has suffered a new blow and a new milestone on the road of the West Indies people's struggle for complete independence and freedom.

The newly established West Indies Federation will be ruled by a governor appointed by Britain. A federal cabinet will be established, with some important positions held by appointed cabinet members. The federal legislative body will consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. Senators will all be appointed, and members of the House of Representatives will be elected.

The main political parties active in the West Indies Federation are: the People's National Party of Jamaica, the Jamaica Labour Party, the West Indies Independence Party of Trinidad, the People's National Movement Party, and the Labour Party of Barbados.

The islands of the West Indies Federation have fertile land and abundant products. The main products are sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa, bananas, rum, oil, bauxite, etc. However, under the rule of the colonial system, their economy is a colonial economy dominated by single crop production. Almost all food is imported throughout the year. The concentration of land is very serious. Only a few industries are mostly processing industries for sugarcane, cotton, and cocoa, as well as winemaking and fruit canning industries. The national economic lifeline is completely controlled by capitalists who monopolize export crops, and the living conditions of the working people are very difficult.

### 西半球的群岛之国

    西半球的群岛之国
    西印度联邦又称加勒比联邦，它由散布在西半球加勒比海的在西印度群岛范围内的一群英属岛屿组织而成，主要的岛屿共十三个。这个新成立的国家是美洲最小的国家，各岛总面积共约二万余平方公里，等于瑞士面积的一半，其中最大的岛屿牙买加岛占总面积的一半以上。
    十五世纪九十年代，哥仑布来到加勒比海，发现了美洲。跟着来到的西班牙殖民者，在加勒比海内西印度群岛的成群岛屿上建立了殖民地。西班牙殖民帝国以后衰落了。英国开始在十七、十八世纪占领了今天的西印度联邦的各岛，西印度群岛的其余部分则陆续被法国、荷兰、美国所瓜分。整个西印度群岛原来居住有一百万以上的有着古老文化的印第安人，他们几乎都在殖民者的火与剑下被杀害殆尽。殖民主义者从非洲运来成百万的黑人充当苦工，这些黑人的后代和黑白混血种人今天构成西印度群岛的主要民族。至于欧洲人仅占极小一部分，例如在牙买加岛的一百五十万人口中，欧洲人不到1％。
    英国在它占领的西印度地区实行了长期的黑暗的殖民统治。它在各个地区分设总督，屯驻殖民统治人员，建立所谓“自治”机构，希望继续对西印度人民进行剥削和奴役。可是近年来西印度人民民族、民主运动日益高涨。1951年，只有八万人口的格林那达岛的农业工人举行大罢工，1953年和1956年，牙买加的工人又多次举行罢工。英帝国主义者不断进行残暴武力镇压，二次大战结束以后，英国已经六次派军到西印度地区镇压罢工和进步组织，但是英国殖民者的这种高压措施，扑灭不了西印度人民的斗争意志和活动。
    近年来，美国对英属西印度的渗入也日益加深，美国资本大量侵入这个地区。美国公司已经控制了牙买加的铁矾土和收买了特立尼达岛上英国最大的石油公司——特立尼达石油公司。美国在第二次大战期间，就已经取得在英属西印度群岛建立军事基地的权利。美国还利用早已和英国联合建立的“加勒比委员会”（后来法国、荷兰也加入）作为在它把持下排挤英国的有力工具。
    为了企图保持自己的殖民利益并对付美国的侵入，英国早在1947年提出筹组一个英属西印度联邦的建议。1953年4月，第一次筹组联邦的会议在伦敦召开；1956年2月，又在伦敦召开第二次筹组联邦的会议。以后，英国议会在1956年8月通过英属加勒比联邦法，规定联邦是“走向独立的、自治领地位的第一步。”去年8月，英国殖民地部表示，西印度联邦定于1958年1月正式成立。现在，西印度联邦宣告建立了。这个步骤无疑是英国的殖民统治遭到新的打击的标志，是西印度人民争取完全的独立自由的斗争道路上一个新的里程碑。
    新成立的西印度联邦将由英国任命的总督进行统治。将设立联邦的内阁，其中有些重要职位由指派的阁员担任。联邦的立法机构由参议院和众议院组成。参议员全部指定，众议员由选举产生。
    在西印度联邦进行政治活动的主要政党有：牙买加岛的人民国家党、牙买加工党，特立尼达岛的西印度独立党、人民民族运动党和巴巴突岛的工党。
    西印度联邦的各个岛屿土地肥沃，物产丰富。主要出产有糖、棉花、咖啡、可可、香蕉、甜酒、石油、铁矾土等。可是在殖民制度的统治下，它们的经济是以单一农作物生产为主的殖民地经济，全年粮食几乎全部依靠进口，土地集中的情况十分严重，仅有的一些工业绝大部分都属于甘蔗、棉花、可可的加工工业、制酒业和水果罐头业。全国经济命脉完全操纵在那些垄断出口作物的资本家手中，劳动人民生活状况十分困苦。　（新华社）
