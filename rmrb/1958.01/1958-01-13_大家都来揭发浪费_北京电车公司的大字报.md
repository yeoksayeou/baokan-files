Let Everyone Expose Waste
Big Character Posters from the Beijing Tram Company

We are very distressed
The company spent 32,800 yuan to buy two sets of dispatch telephones that are not suitable for our use. We request the Party committee to promptly investigate and affix responsibility, and properly handle these two sets of telephones. (Technical Section Group)

Who should be responsible for this waste?
In 1957, the repair shop newly manufactured forty trailer electric brakes. From March to June, one-third had been completed, and some parts were already complete. However, production was stopped midway. Because samples of hand-operated electric brakes were bought from Tianjin, the trailer electric brakes had become obsolete. As a result, the two items of manufactured magnetic steel sleeves and magnetic coils alone wasted more than 1,000 yuan.

We want to ask: When the trailer electric brakes were being put into production, the finished electric hand brakes from Tianjin had already appeared, why didn't the company leadership know? Can such a slow awareness of advanced technology be forgiven?

Suggestions regarding the Nursery
Our company's nursery has had waste since its establishment. Now there are more than fifty children, but there are twenty-three staff members, and the company spends more than 1,000 yuan per month (paid from the welfare fund of all employees). This 1,000 yuan plus is only spent on thirty-nine employees (some employees have two children in care), and we feel this is unreasonable.

Our comrades in the whole nursery propose the following improvement measures:
Cancel the current nursery and entrust the children to nursery institutions near the employee's residence. This will not increase the burden on employees. Currently, the mothers in our nursery pay 10 yuan per month for the children's food, plus round-trip transportation costs, totaling about 12 yuan. Street nursery institutions only cost 12 or 13 yuan per month, so the amount is roughly the same.

The advantages of this improvement measure are: First, the more than 1,000 yuan spent on thirty-nine employees can be saved and used for all employees. Second, the nursery can free up twenty-seven large rooms, which can solve the urgent housing needs of dozens of employees. Third, all twenty-three nursery staff can be transferred to production positions.

If the nursery cannot be cancelled, then the site needs to be expanded to take in a large number of children to meet the childcare needs of the majority of employees; in the staffing, it must conform to the principle of streamlining. (All members of the Nursery)

True Thrift, or False Thrift?
Our factory only pays attention to superficial thrift, and no one pays attention to the details. For example, our factory has been clamoring to save coal, but half-burned coal kernels are everywhere.

Please leaders personally check the coal ash pile of our factory. (Chen Shusen, Trolleybus Factory)

    大家都来揭发浪费
    北京电车公司的大字报
    我们很心疼
    公司花了三万二千八百元买了两套不适合我们用的调度电话。请党委迅速调查追究责任，妥善处理这两套电话。（技术科小组）
  这一浪费应由谁负责？
    1957年修理厂新制拖车电闸四十辆，从3月到6月已经完成了三分之一，有的零件已经齐了。但是中途停止了生产。因为从天津买来了手电闸的实样，拖车电闸已成落后的东西。结果，仅制好的吸铁钢套和吸铁线圈两项，就浪费一千多元。
    我们要问：当拖车电闸正投入生产的时候，天津的电手闸成品已经出现，公司领导为什么不知道？对先进技术的嗅觉如此迟钝是可以原谅的吗？
                  （修理厂生产股）
    关于托儿所的建议
    咱们公司托儿所自成立到现在，一直存在着浪费现象。现在有五十多个孩子，却有二十三个工作人员，公司每月支出一千多元（由全体职工福利费中开支）。每月这一千多元，只花在三十九个职工身上（有的职工托两个孩子），我们感到这样是不合理的。
    我们全所同志提出如下的改进措施：
    把现在托儿所取消，把儿童托于职工住宅附近的托儿机关。这样并不会增加职工负担。现在，咱们托儿所的妈妈们每月交儿童伙食费十元，加上往返车费，合计十二元左右。街道的托儿机关每月也只是十二、三元，钱数大致相等。
    这一改进措施的好处是：一、把花在三十九个职工身上的一千多元节省下来，用在全体职工身上。二、托儿所腾出二十七间宽大房屋，可以解决数十个职工急需住房的问题。三、托儿所二十三个职工都可以转到生产岗位。
    如果托儿所不能取消，那就需要扩大所址，大量吸收儿童，满足广大职工托儿的要求；在工作人员配备上，要合乎精简的原则。　（托儿所全体）
  真节约，还是假节约？
    我厂节约只注意表面，细节地方就没人注意。例如，我厂一直嚷节省煤，但是半生的煤核满处都是。
    请领导亲自检查一下我厂的煤灰堆。　（无轨厂陈树森）
