    Don't Blindly Recruit Soldiers and Buy Horses
    Our Longmen Township is currently engaged in a vigorous winter production campaign, and some agricultural cooperatives are feeling the strain of having too much work and not enough people. However, some departments are blindly recruiting "private soldiers" and buying "private horses" in more than a dozen agricultural cooperatives in my township, including Longxing, Yinqiu, Zhangbi, Kuqian, Guantian, Shatian, and Yuanxing. As a result, members of these dozen or so cooperatives are leaving, both openly and secretly. According to current statistics, more than 300 people have left. The main units recruiting soldiers and buying horses in my township are the timber industry units of Tianhe, Lianhua, and Yongxin. They neither go through the relevant departments for introductions or certifications, nor do they sign contracts for labor needs with the agricultural cooperatives, but instead pull away the labor force of the agricultural cooperatives through private collusion. The Longxing cooperative has a relatively large medium-sized water conservancy project that requires concentrating more than 200 laborers from the entire cooperative for half a month to a month to complete. However, the cooperative has already lost more than 100 laborers (accounting for 50% of the labor force), which has caused those remaining at home to feel uneasy, seriously affecting the cooperative's inability to fully develop water conservancy construction. Therefore, we suggest that these departments do not recruit private soldiers or buy private horses.

    不要盲目招兵买马
    我们龙门乡目前正轰轰烈烈地搞冬季生产运动，有的农业社都感到事多人少。可是，有些部门却盲目地在我乡龙星、吟秋、樟陂、库前、灌田、沙田、沅兴等十几个农业社，招私兵买私马。这样，使得这十几个社的社员，明走一个，暗走一个。据现在统计外出的有三百多名。在我乡招兵买马的，主要是天河、莲花、永新等木材业单位。他们既不通过有关部门的介绍证明，又不与农业社签订需要劳力的合同，而是通过私人串联的办法，把农业社的劳力拉走了。龙星社有一座比较大的中型水利，需要集中全社二百多个劳力修半个月至一个月才能完工。可是，该社已外出劳力一百余名（占劳力50％），这样就引起了在家的社员也不安心，严重影响该社水利建设不能全面展开。因此，我们建议这些部门不要招私兵买私马。
