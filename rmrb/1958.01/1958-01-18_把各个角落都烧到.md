    Burn the Fire to Every Corner
    Wan Xiangxin

    Practicing strict economy and opposing waste are major issues related to building our poor country into a prosperous and strong socialist power. In the past, many people did not fully understand this principle, and there were large or small loopholes of waste in many regions and units. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to launch an anti-waste movement in the midst of the rectification campaign.

    This fire against waste, ignited by the wind of the rectification movement, will spread to every corner of the country, awakening all those who do not understand the principle of practicing strict economy. Are there still such people? Yes. According to the inspection of the industrial and transportation departments in Anhui and other places, when the broad masses rose up to oppose waste, the leading personnel of some units remained inactive. They believed that the masses had already exposed some wasteful phenomena during the airing of views, and now there was no waste to combat; or they believed that large enterprises had significant waste, while small enterprises had no "profit" to be gained; some were even afraid of "getting burned," worrying that exposing waste would put them in a "passive" position... These ideas are all unreasonable, and the flames of anti-waste should first burn away these thoughts.

    The previous several economy drives have achieved great results, but there have also been phenomena of "water passing over the skin of the earth" and "the wind passes but the roots do not move, and the grass grows again in spring." How to overcome this superficial problem? There are two key points: one is to profoundly criticize and thoroughly correct the erroneous ideas of leaders who blindly pursue grandeur, novelty, and think "with a large family and a big business, it doesn't matter"; the other is to establish concrete measures to prevent waste in enterprise management, rules, and regulations. The specific measures stipulated by the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the allocation of land for construction, and the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's decision to regularly hold anti-waste exhibitions, are all good ways to prevent waste.

    To spread the fire of this anti-waste campaign to every corner, it is also necessary for all employees to give play to their conscious role as masters of the country. The employees of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have set a good example. In the anti-waste struggle, they boldly exposed waste and actively put forward suggestions for improvement; they sharply criticized the bureaucracy of leading personnel and also seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism. We can imagine that when everyone understands the principle of practicing strict economy, and everyone pays attention to opposing waste, a style of diligence and thrift will be truly established. As soon as wasteful phenomena are encountered, everyone will denounce them, so that they can no longer damage our construction cause.

    把各个角落都烧到
    万向辛
    厉行节约，反对浪费，是关系到把我们这个穷国建设成富足的社会主义强国的大事情。过去，许多人还不完全懂得这个道理，不少地区、不少单位都存在着或大或小的浪费漏洞。因此，在整风中间来一个反浪费运动就完全必要了。
    这把乘整风运动之风点起的反浪费之火，将燃遍全国各个角落，唤醒所有不懂厉行节约道理的人。目前还有这种人吗？有。据安徽等地工业交通部门的检查，在广大群众起来反对浪费现象的时候，有一部分单位的领导人员却按兵不动。他们认为：鸣放中群众已经揭发了些浪费现象，现在没有浪费可反了；或者认为：大企业浪费大，小企业没有什么“油水”；有的人甚至害怕“引火烧身”，耽心揭发出浪费来会“被动”……这些想法都是毫无道理的，应当首先让反浪费的烈火烧掉这些思想。
    过去几次的节约运动收到了巨大成效，但也有过“水过地皮湿”、“风过根未动，春来草又生”的现象。这种不深不透的毛病怎么克服？关键有两个：一是深刻批判和彻底纠正领导人员盲目贪大、求新，“家大业大，满不在乎”等错误思想；一是在企业管理、规章制度等方面确立防止浪费的具体办法。中共昆明市委规定的关于调拨建设用地的具体措施，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂决定经常举办反浪费展览会，都是防止浪费的好办法。
    要把这次反浪费之火燃遍各个角落，还需要全体职工群众发挥主人翁的自觉。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的职工树立了良好的榜样。他们在反浪费斗争中既大胆地揭发了浪费，又积极地提出改进的意见；既尖锐地批评了领导人员的官僚主义，又严肃地开展了批评和自我批评。我们可以想见，人人都懂得了厉行节约的道理，人人都注意反对浪费，就将会切实树立起勤俭节约的风气。一遇见浪费现象，就会人人喊打，使它们不能再损害我们的建设事业。
