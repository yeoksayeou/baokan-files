    Shandong Province's Great Leap Forward in Winter Patriotic Health Campaign
    Technical Issues in Eliminating the Four Pests Begin to Receive Attention
    (Our dispatch) Shandong Province's winter patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, is surging towards a new climax.
    At the end of last year, Shandong Province carried out a vigorous winter patriotic health campaign and achieved great results, with countless advanced sanitary villages emerging. In November of last year, Pingyuan County launched the "Three Cleans and Four Digs" campaign (clean indoor spaces, clean streets, clean courtyards; dig toilets, chicken coops, livestock pens, and millstones). In twenty-seven days, the county's eleven districts, one hundred and eight townships, and one thousand and forty-six villages dug over 100,400 toilets, over 20,000 chicken coops, 5,500 millstones, over 15,000 livestock pens, dug out over 150,700 catties of fly pupae, and accumulated over 210,000 large cartloads of fertilizer. One hundred and thirty-four villages implemented manure management, and 685 "Three Cleans" villages emerged. At the end of last year, Chengwu County captured over 90,000 rats and sparrows in two months, used "666" powder to exterminate large numbers of overwintering mosquitoes and flies in over 140,000 houses, eliminated over 300 catties of fly pupae, improved over 54,300 toilets, built over 1,000 new toilets, and 297 advanced sanitary villages emerged. Linzi County improved over 3,000 toilets and eliminated over 1,000 catties of fly pupae. The entire Linyi Special District saw the emergence of 683 "Three Cleans and Four No's" villages. Since October of last year, Shan County, a model sanitary county in Shandong Province, has launched a patriotic health campaign of "everyone participating, every household mobilized" centered around its core work. In forty days, it eliminated over 155,000 rats and sparrows, fumigated over 57,000 houses with "666," and launched a "Three Cleans and Five Digs" campaign, accumulating over 178,700 large cartloads of fertilizer. Currently, 90% of the agricultural cooperatives in the county have implemented "unified manure management with designated personnel in charge," and 434 model sanitary villages have emerged.
    Jinan City plans to become a basically "Four No's" city within five years. During the Spring Festival, the city will launch a large-scale, vigorous blitz campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote sanitation, laying the foundation for basically achieving a fly-free city this year. On January 4th, the city convened a meeting of over 1,000 administrative leaders from all sectors of Shandong Province and Jinan City. Jinan City Deputy Mayor Di Jingxiang gave a report. Subsequently, under the personal leadership of provincial and municipal Party and government leaders, over 20,000 staff members of state organs in the city were organized, divided into responsibility areas, and contracted to clean streets. Each district organized over 100,000 residents to clean streets and household courtyards. More than twenty propaganda teams and five broadcasting propaganda vehicles were organized to conduct propaganda activities on the city's major streets. Blackboards and theaters throughout the city also carried out extensive propaganda to the masses. Jinan City also plans to organize a mass inspection of ten thousand people during the blitz campaign, learning from each other, and making the campaign regular. A summary evaluation will be conducted after the Spring Festival. In order to strengthen the campaign to eliminate the four pests, the health department will take the lead and hire experts to establish a planning committee for eliminating the four pests to solve technical measures issues.
    Many counties in Shandong Province have put forward their future goals for carrying out the patriotic health campaign. Gaotang County plans for 60% of the county's villages to become advanced sanitary villages this year. Currently, the county has 377 advanced sanitary villages. This year, the county wants to create 39 "Three Cleans and Four No's" townships, 11 near "Three Cleans and Four No's" townships, and 79 "Three Cleans and Four No's" villages.
    In order to launch a large-scale winter patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, Junan, Pingyin, Pingyuan, Mengyin, Jimo, Chengwu, Yanggu, Laiyang, and other counties have organized many people to visit and learn from advanced sanitary areas. In early December of last year, Junan County organized over 50 medical and health leaders from the county to visit 49 villages, organs, and schools, and summarized ten major experiences in sanitary movements in advanced areas. More than fifty cities and counties throughout the province have successively held conferences to evaluate model sanitation, selecting tens of thousands of sanitation models and advanced figures.
    In order to push the province's winter patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests to a new climax, the Shandong Provincial Department of Health and the Patriotic Health Movement Committee convened a meeting on the 7th with the heads of health and epidemic prevention stations or patriotic health movement committee leaders from special districts and sixteen counties and cities to summarize and exchange experiences in eliminating the four pests and promoting sanitation.

    山东省冬季爱国卫生运动大跃进
    除四害中的技术问题开始引起重视
    本报讯　山东省以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动正推向新的高潮。
    去年年底，山东省各地开展了轰轰烈烈的冬季爱国卫生运动，取得了很大的成绩，出现了无数个卫生先进村。平原县去年11月开展三洁四挖运动（室内洁、街道洁、院内洁，挖厕所、鸡窝、栏圈、磨道），全县十一个区一百零八个乡一千零四十六个村，二十七天里挖厕所十万零四百多个，鸡窝二万多个，磨道五千五百个，栏圈一万五千多个，挖蝇蛹十五万零七百多斤，积肥二十一万多大车，有一百三十四个村实行了粪便管理，出现了六百八十五个三洁村庄。城武县去年年底两个月捕捉鼠雀九万多只，有十四万多间房屋用“六六六”粉消灭了大量过冬蚊蝇，消灭蝇蛹三百多斤，改良厕所五万四千三百多个，新建厕所一千多个，出现了二百九十七个卫生先进村。临邑县改良厕所三千多个，消灭蝇蛹一千多斤。临沂全专区出现六百八十三个三洁四无村。山东省卫生模范县单县去年10月以来围绕中心工作，开展了一个“人人动手、户户动员”的爱国卫生运动，四十天里共消灭鼠雀十五万五千多只，用“六六六”熏屋五万七千多间，并且开展了三净五挖运动，积肥十七万八千七百多大车。目前全县有90％的农业社实行了“粪便统一管理、专人负责”，出现了四百三十四个卫生模范村。

    山东省不少县提出了今后开展爱国卫生运动的奋斗目标。高唐县计划今年全县60％的村成为卫生先进村，现在全县有三百七十七个卫生先进村，今年该县要创造三十九个三洁四无乡，十一个接近三洁四无乡和七十九个三洁四无村。
    为了掀起一个规模宏大的以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动，莒南、平阴、平原、蒙阴、即墨、城武、阳谷、莱阳等县，还组织许多人到先进卫生地区参观学习。莒南县在去年12月上旬组织全县五十多名医疗卫生负责干部，到四十九个村庄、机关、学校参观，并且总结出先进地区卫生运动十大经验。全省有五十多个市县先后召开评选卫生模范会议，选出了成千上万的卫生模范和先进人物。
    为了使全省以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动推向新的高潮，山东省卫生厅和爱国卫生运动委员会在7日召开专区和十六个县市的卫生防疫站站长或爱国卫生运动委员会负责人会议，总结和交流除四害、讲卫生运动的经验。  （冰峰）
