Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: Soviet newspapers published on the 19th a decree from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, awarding the title of Hero of Socialist Labor to thirty-two agricultural workers of the Belarusian Republic. They were also awarded the Order of Lenin and the "Hammer and Sickle" Gold Medal in recognition of their outstanding achievements in developing agriculture. In addition, four thousand nine hundred and seventy agricultural workers in Belarus received orders and medals.

Belarusian agricultural production achieved great success last year, with collective farms and state farms harvesting 25% more grain than in 1956. The plans for the requisition and purchase of grain, meat, milk, potatoes, vegetables, and other agricultural products in 1957 were completed almost two months ahead of schedule. Belarus's flax production ranks second among the Soviet Union's republics, producing more flax fiber than France and Belgium combined.

This year, collective farms and state farms in Belarus plan to increase the average per-unit area yield of grain, potatoes, flax, and sugar beets by 20% to 30%. On a per capita basis, Belarus's milk production this year will exceed that of the United States. By the end of this year, Belarus's production level of major meat and dairy products will reach the level planned for 1960.

    白俄罗斯农业生产突飞猛进
    大批农业工作者获奖
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联报纸19日登载了苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令，授予白俄罗斯共和国的三十二名农业工作者以社会主义劳动英雄称号，同时授予他们列宁勋章和“镰刀和锤子”金质奖章，以表扬他们在发展农业中的卓越成就。此外，白俄罗斯还有四千九百七十名农业工作者得到了勋章和奖章。
    白俄罗斯共和国的农业生产在去年取得了巨大成就，集体农庄和国营农场收获的谷物比1956年增加了25％。1957年粮食、肉类、牛奶、马铃薯、蔬菜和其他农产品的征购和收购计划差不多提前两个月就完成了。白俄罗斯的亚麻生产在苏联各加盟共和国中占第二位，它生产的亚麻纤维比法国和比利时两国产量的总和还多。
    今年，白俄罗斯的集体农庄和国营农场计划把谷物、马铃薯、亚麻、甜菜的单位面积产量平均提高20％到30％。按人口平均计算，白俄罗斯的牛奶产量今年将超过美国。到今年年底时，白俄罗斯主要肉制品和奶制品的生产水平将达到1960年计划规定的水平。
