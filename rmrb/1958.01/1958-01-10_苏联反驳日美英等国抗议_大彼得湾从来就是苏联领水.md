Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: TASS, Moscow, 8th: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 7th, refuting the Japanese government's protest against the Soviet government's decision on Peter the Great Bay promulgated last July, pointing out that its protest was unfounded.

    This note was a reply to a note from the Japanese government to the Soviet government on July 26th of last year regarding the Soviet decision on Peter the Great Bay. In the aforementioned decision adopted by the Soviet government on July 20th of last year, it was stipulated that the straight line between the mouth of the Tumen River and Cape Povorotny shall be the boundary of the Soviet internal waters in the Peter the Great Bay area and the baseline for calculating the breadth of Soviet territorial waters. Foreign ships and foreign aircraft must obtain the permission of the relevant Soviet authorities to navigate and fly in this area.

    After the publication of this decision, the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union, in the aforementioned note to the Soviet government, declared a protest on behalf of its government against the Soviet government's decision.

    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply note to the Japanese Embassy stated that Peter the Great Bay has always been Soviet territorial waters. The Regulations on Marine Fishing Grounds within the Territorial Waters of the Amur Province promulgated by the Russian government in 1901 expressly stipulated that the straight line from the mouth of the Tumen River to Cape Povorotny is the boundary of the Russian internal waters in the Peter the Great Bay area.

    The note said that it is completely unfounded to insist that the decision promulgated by the Soviet government on this issue undermines the freedom of navigation and fishing. Because the freedom of navigation and fishing only exists on the high seas, and Peter the Great Bay is Soviet internal waters.

    Since the United States and the British governments had also lodged protests, the Soviet Union also delivered notes with the same content to the United States and Britain.

### 苏联反驳日美英等国抗议  大彼得湾从来就是苏联领水

    苏联反驳日美英等国抗议
    大彼得湾从来就是苏联领水
    据新华社9日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联外交部7日照会日本驻苏联大使馆，反驳日本政府对苏联政府去年7月颁布的关于大彼得湾的决定的抗议，指出它的抗议是毫无根据的。
    这个照会是对日本政府去年7月26日就苏联关于大彼得湾的决定给苏联政府的一项照会的答复。苏联政府在去年7月20日通过的上述决定中，规定以图们江江口和波沃罗特尼角之间的直线为大彼得湾区域的苏联内海界限和计算苏联领海宽度的起点线，外国船只和外国飞机必须取得苏联有关机关的许可才能在这一区域航行和飞行。
    在这个决定发表以后，日本驻苏大使馆在给苏联政府的上述照会中，代表它的政府声明抗议苏联政府的决定。
    苏联外交部给日本大使馆的复照说，大彼得湾从来都是苏联的领水。在俄国政府1901年颁布的阿穆尔省领水内的海上渔场条例中就曾经明文规定，从图们江江口到波沃罗特尼角的直线是俄国大彼得湾区域内海的界线。
    照会说，硬说苏联政府颁布的关于这一问题的决定破坏了航行和捕鱼的自由，这是毫无根据的。因为，航行和捕鱼的自由只存在于公海上，而大彼得湾却是苏联的内海。
    由于美国和英国政府也曾提出抗议，苏联还把同样内容的照会递交给美国和英国。
