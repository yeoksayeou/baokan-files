Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: According to a France-Presse report from Tokyo, the Japanese Defense Agency is accelerating its plan to build a second missile base on Niijima, a small island outside Tokyo Bay.

The Japanese Defense Agency has announced that it will build a missile launch site on this island to install rocket launch equipment to be purchased from Switzerland this spring. The Defense Agency also decided to build military facilities such as airports on the island.

This plan of the Japanese "Defense Agency" has aroused strong opposition from peace-loving people in Tokyo and residents of Niijima.

Currently, Japan has already built a missile base at the Tsuchiura Air Force Base in Ibaraki Prefecture. There is also a rocket research center in Michikawa, Akita Prefecture, managed by the University of Tokyo and working under the guidance of Professor Itokawa.

    日本忙于建立第二导弹基地
    据新华社25日讯　据法新社东京消息，日本防卫厅正在加速推行在东京湾外的小岛新岛上建立第二个导弹基地的计划。
    日本防卫厅曾经宣布要在这个岛上建立导弹发射场，以安装将在今年春季从瑞士买来的火箭发射装备。防卫厅同时决定要在岛上修建飞机场等军事设施。
    日本“防卫厅”的这个计划已经引起东京爱好和平人士和新岛居民的强烈反对。
    目前，日本在茨城县的土浦空军基地已经建成一个导弹基地。在秋田县的道川还设有由东京大学管理的、在系川教授指导下工作的火箭研究中心。
