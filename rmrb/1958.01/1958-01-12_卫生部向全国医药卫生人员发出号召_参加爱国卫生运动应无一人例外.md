Xinhua News Agency, 10th -- The Ministry of Health issued a "Notice on Mobilizing National Medical and Health Personnel to Actively Participate in the Patriotic Health Campaign" on the 9th.

The notice stated that currently, the Patriotic Health Campaign has been launched vigorously throughout the country, from cities to villages. All medical and health personnel at all levels of health administration departments, hospitals, medical colleges, epidemic prevention stations, clinics, district health centers, health stations, joint clinics, and other business units, as well as mass health organizations and individual practitioners, must recognize the great significance of carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign. It lies in eliminating diseases, invigorating everyone, changing customs, and transforming the country. Every medical and health worker must participate in the Patriotic Health Campaign without exception. All levels of health departments and all institutions must do a good job of eliminating the four pests, environmental sanitation, and personal hygiene in accordance with the regulations and requirements of the local Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. It is very inappropriate for some health units to lag behind the masses in the Patriotic Health Campaign. Health agencies and health personnel must practice what they preach in the movement, strive for advancement, and should not lag behind, only promote, not hinder. They should become active promoters and organizers of the movement, and play a leading and backbone role in the mass movement, using concrete actions to inspire and drive the masses. They should also pay attention to maintaining consistency and setting an example for the masses.

Health cadres who have been sent down to rural areas, factories, and grassroots organizations should actively participate in the grassroots Patriotic Health Campaign in conjunction with labor training, and should publicize health knowledge and introduce health work experience to the masses.

The notice stated that in the Patriotic Health Campaign, health and medical units must conscientiously assume the responsibility of scientific and technical guidance under the unified leadership of the local Party and government. Effective and simple methods that are currently being promoted should be taught to the masses in a timely manner, so that the masses not only know how to do it, but also understand why it is being done. Arming the masses with technical methods and health knowledge, and enhancing the confidence and determination of the masses, will enable the movement to achieve greater results. All health units should also pay close attention to the creations of the masses in the "eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene" movement, and absorb the wisdom of the masses to enrich the content of science and technology.

The notice also requires health administrative departments at all levels to contact local Red Cross societies and medical and health organizations, grasp the current favorable situation of the Patriotic Health Campaign, seize typical cases and experiences, summarize them in a timely manner, and promote them rapidly, so as to make the movement more widespread and in-depth.

    卫生部向全国医药卫生人员发出号召
    参加爱国卫生运动应无一人例外
    新华社10日讯　卫生部9日发出“动员全国医药卫生人员积极参加爱国卫生运动的通知”。
    通知说，目前全国各地，从城市到农村，爱国卫生运动已经轰轰烈烈地开展起来。各级卫生行政部门、各医院、医学院、卫生防疫站、门诊部、区卫生所、保健站、联合诊所等业务单位和群众性卫生团体以及个体开业等全体医药卫生人员，必须认识开展爱国卫生运动的重大意义，是在于消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造国家。每一个医药卫生人员，要毫无例外地参加爱国卫生运动。各级卫生部门、各个事业单位，都必须按照所在地区爱国卫生运动委员会的规定与要求，做好除四害、环境卫生和个人卫生。有些卫生单位在爱国卫生运动中落后于群众，这种情况是很不应该的。卫生机关、卫生人员在运动中必须身体力行，争取先进，不应落后，只能促进，不能促退。要成为运动的积极宣传者和组织者，并且在群众运动中起带头和骨干作用，用具体行动来启发和带动群众。并应注意保持经常，为群众树立榜样。
    下放到农村、工厂和基层组织中的卫生干部，应结合劳动锻炼，积极参加基层爱国卫生运动，并应向群众宣传卫生常识，介绍卫生工作经验。
    通知说，在爱国卫生运动中，卫生医疗单位必须在当地党政统一领导下认真担负起科学技术指导的责任。对目前行之有效推行简便的方法，应及时教给群众，使群众不仅会做，还要懂得为什么要这样做的道理。在技术方法与卫生知识上武装群众，提高群众的信心与决心，就能使运动获得更大成果。各卫生单位还要密切注意群众在“除四害、讲卫生”运动中的创造，吸收群众的智慧来丰富科学技术的内容。
    通知还要求各级卫生行政部门，联系各地红十字会和医药卫生团体，掌握当前爱国卫生运动的有利形势，抓典型、抓经验，及时总结，迅速推广，以使运动更普及、更深入。（附图片）
