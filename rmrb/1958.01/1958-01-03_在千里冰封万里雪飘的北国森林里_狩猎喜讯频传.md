    In the Frozen Northland Forests, Where Ice Extends a Thousand Miles and Snow Drifts Ten Thousand
    Hunting Successes Frequently Reported
    (Our Dispatch) In the frigid winter season of the northern lands, where "ice stretches a thousand miles and snow drifts ten thousand," hunters active in the virgin forests of the Xing'an and Wanda Mountains of Heilongjiang Province are tracking and hunting wild animals on the snow. The winter hunting season began earlier in 1957 and is on a larger scale than in previous years. The first group of nearly ten thousand experienced hunters from various mountain counties entered the forest areas in early December. They brought with them a large number of hunting tools and various supplies and will settle in the mountains for three months. During this "golden" hunting season, they will ensure the overfulfillment of the province's original target of capturing 320,000 wild animals of various types.

    Recently, Heilongjiang Province had a heavy snowfall, creating favorable conditions for hunting. In recent days, news of the hunters' abundant harvests has frequently been reported from the cold mountain areas and forests. In the mountainous areas of Yilan County, hunters captured four unusually ferocious tigers. In the mountainous areas of Baoqing, Qing'an, and Dongning counties, hunters captured more than fifty live deer in just a few days. Hunters active in the vast grasslands and mountainous areas of Baoqing County have captured 10,000 wild animals, including yellow weasels, field mice, gray rats, and sables, in less than a month. According to the investigation of Zhou Xianzhao, an old hunter from Shuangzihe Town in the Lesser Xing'an Mountains forest area, last year this forest area was able to catch 30 yellow weasels within ten square miles, three times more than the catch in the same area in previous years. The province has currently captured more than 80,000 wild animals.

    With the arrival of the hunting season, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also strengthened their supply and marketing work in this area. In addition to going deep into the mountainous areas to supply hunters with the necessary materials, some supply and marketing cooperatives also provide technical guidance on the rectification standards of animal skins and ensure timely purchase.

    In order to prevent rare and valuable wild animals such as deer, roe deer, otters, lynx, mink, and tigers from decreasing year by year or becoming extinct, many hunters are taking various measures to capture these animals alive so that they can be handed over to state-owned farms for breeding. At present, state-owned wildlife farms have been established in Hengdaohezi, Yuquan, Mudanjiang, Yabuli, Xunke, Shanshi, Yichun, and other places throughout the province. Some agricultural cooperatives are also conducting small-scale experimental breeding. The largest state-owned Hengdaohezi Wildlife Farm in China, in addition to raising many locally produced wild animals, also raises some Arctic foxes, silver-gray foxes, and minks imported from the Soviet Union.

    Heilongjiang Province is one of the key wild fur producing areas in China. The highest annual output of only thirteen main furs such as mink, muskrat, gray rat, ermine, otter, and fox has reached more than 910,000 pieces, with a total value of more than 2.2 million yuan; the export volume of mink, muskrat, and gray rat accounts for more than 50% of the total national export volume. However, the current annual output of valuable mountain furs is only about 40% of the highest historical output, far from meeting the needs of domestic and foreign markets. In order to vigorously develop the hunting industry, the state not only provided loans to hunters last year and supplied various hunting tools, but also adjusted the regional price differences for fur purchases. Various agricultural cooperatives have also stipulated incentive systems for hunters (members) (in addition to the normal work points, 40% to 70% of the excess will be extracted as dividends), which has encouraged the enthusiasm of hunters to enter the mountains for hunting.

### 在千里冰封万里雪飘的北国森林里  狩猎喜讯频传

    在千里冰封万里雪飘的北国森林里
    狩猎喜讯频传
    本报讯　在“千里冰封，万里雪飘”的北国寒冬季节里，活跃在黑龙江省兴安岭和完达山脉原始森林的狩猎者们，正在雪地上跟踪追迹捕打野兽。1957年冬季狩猎开始早，规模也较往年为大。山区各县首批有经验的近万名猎人已经在12月初先后进入林区。他们携带了大量捕兽工具和各种物资，要在山林里定居三个月。他们要在这狩猎的“黄金”季节里，保证超额完成全省原订三十二万只各种野兽的捕打任务。
    日前黑龙江降了一阵大雪，为捕打野兽工作创造了良好条件。这些日子，寒山区和森林里频繁地传来了狩猎者们丰收的喜讯。在依兰县的山区里，猎手们捉到了四只凶猛异常的大老虎。在宝清、庆安、东宁县山区的猎人们，几天内就捕捉到五十多只活鹿。活跃在宝清大片荒草地和山区的猎手们，不到一个月打到了黄鼬、山老鼠、灰鼠和紫貂等野兽一万只。据小兴安岭林区双子河镇老猎人周显志的调查，去年这个林区在十平方里内能打住三十个黄鼬，比往年同一面积的捕获量增加三倍。全省目前已捕到八万多只野兽。
    随着狩猎季节的到来，各地供销社也加强了这方面的供销工作。有的供销合作社除深入山区跟随猎人供应他们必需的物资外，还对兽皮的整治规格都作了技术指导，并做到了及时收购。
    为了使稀有的贵重野生动物——鹿、獐子、水獭、猞猁、貂、虎等不致逐年减少或断种，许多猎人对这些动物采取各种办法捕捉活的，以便交国家饲养场饲养和繁殖。目前，全省已经在横道河子、玉泉、牡丹江、牙不利、逊克、山市、伊春等地建立了国营野生动物饲养场。有的农业合作社也进行小型的试验性的饲养。我国规模最大的国营横道河子野生动物饲养场除饲养了许多本地出产的野生动物外，还饲养了一些苏联进口的北极貉、银灰貉和水貂。
    黑龙江省是我国野生皮张重点产区之一，仅元皮、香鼠、灰鼠、艾虎、水獭、狐狸等十三种主要皮张，最高年产量曾达九十一万多张，总值二百二十多万元；出口的元皮、香鼠、灰鼠均占全国出口总量的50％以上。但山产贵重的皮毛目前年产量仅达到历史上最高产量的40％左右，远不能满足国内外市场的需要。为了大力开展狩猎事业，国家去年不仅给猎民贷了款，供应了各种狩猎的工具，对皮张的收购地区差价也作了调整，各地农业合作社又对狩猎者（社员）规定了奖励制度（超过定额，除照常给工分外，再按超额部分提取40％到70％作为分红）等，这些鼓励了猎人们入山狩猎的积极性。（康伟中）
