    Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 17th - The Tunisian government spokesman announced on the 16th that Tunisian President Bourguiba refused to receive General Buchalet, the "military envoy" sent by French Prime Minister Gaillard. Tunisia believes that France's sending of military personnel to make unreasonable demands on Tunisia is an infuriating act of intimidation.
    Buchalet was sent to Tunisia on the 15th. He carried a strongly worded letter from Gaillard, which falsely claimed that several French soldiers captured by the Algerian National Liberation Army on the Algerian-Tunisian border had been transported to Tunisia, and Tunisia must hand these people over. The French press believes that this is tantamount to presenting Tunisia with an "ultimatum."
    While sending Buchalet to Tunisia, France also unilaterally suspended the Franco-Tunisian relations negotiations that had been ongoing in Paris, using the same excuse. It is believed that all these actions by France are intended to put pressure on Tunisia to make concessions in the negotiations.

    对法国的威吓行动忍无可忍
    突尼斯总统拒见法国特使
    据新华社17日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯政府发言人在16日宣布，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴拒绝接见法国总理盖伊阿派来的“军事特使”布夏勒将军。突尼斯认为，法国派军人来向突尼斯提出无理要求，是一种令人气愤的威吓行动。
    布夏勒是在15日被派往突尼斯的。他随身携带盖伊阿的一封措词强硬的信，信中无中生有地硬说阿尔及利亚民族解放军在阿尔及利亚—突尼斯边境俘虏的几个法国兵已经运往突尼斯，一定要突尼斯交出这几个人来。法国报刊认为，这无异于向突尼斯提出“最后通牒”。
    在派布夏勒去突尼斯的同时，法国还以同样的借口片面中断了一直在巴黎进行的法突关系问题谈判。人们认为，法国这种种作法都是为了向突尼斯施行压力，要它在谈判中让步。
