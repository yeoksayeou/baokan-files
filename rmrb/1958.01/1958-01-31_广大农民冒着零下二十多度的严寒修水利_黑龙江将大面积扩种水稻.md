Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th. Farmers in Heilongjiang Province are carrying out large-scale water conservancy construction in the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, expanding paddy fields by more than 1.5 million mu. This province, which has only 90 to 150 frost-free days a year, will have a total paddy field area of 5.25 million mu this year. From the Mudanjiang River banks in the southernmost part (43 degrees north latitude) to the Huma County area (near 52 degrees north latitude) on the Heilongjiang River, every county will have a large area of rice.

In recent years, rice in Heilongjiang Province has developed on a large scale towards the north, breaking the traditional saying that rice is not suitable for large-scale planting north of 45 degrees north latitude. The rice produced here is sweeter than the rice from the southern provinces and can be compared with the famous Tianjin Xiaozhan rice. Although only one crop of rice is grown per year, the yield is not low. In the past three years, the average yield per mu in the province has been as high as 432 jin. In Ai Hui and other counties around 50 degrees north latitude, there have been high-yield records of an average of 660 jin per mu over large areas of rice.

It is very tight to plant one crop of rice a year in Heilongjiang Province. In years with normal temperatures, sowing begins as soon as the late frost stops, and early frost arrives within a few days after the rice matures. If there is any delay in any production link during this period, production will be greatly threatened. In the twelve years since liberation, the agricultural department has sorted, cultivated, and selected to propagate a variety of early-maturing rice varieties. For example, the "Xiao Beihai" and "Guoguang" varieties can mature in just over ninety days after planting, so even in the northern Huma County, it is possible to grow rice. In addition, the farmers here have also taken many measures to shorten the rice growing season and harvest period.

### 广大农民冒着零下二十多度的严寒修水利  黑龙江将大面积扩种水稻

    广大农民冒着零下二十多度的严寒修水利
    黑龙江将大面积扩种水稻
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省农民正在零下二十多度的严寒中大规模地兴修水利，扩展一百五十多万亩稻田。这个一年只有九十天到一百五十天无霜期的省份，今年的水田总面积将达到五百二十五万亩，从最南部（北纬四十三度）的牡丹江两岸，直到黑龙江边呼玛县一带（北纬五十二度附近），每县都将有大面积的水稻。
    这几年黑龙江省水稻大面积向北发展，打破了北纬四十五度以北地区不宜大量种植水稻的传统说法。这里出产的大米比江南各省的大米更加香甜，可以同有名的天津小站米相比美。所种水稻虽然是一年一熟，但产量也不低，近三年来全省每亩平均产量高的达到四百三十二斤。北纬五十度左右的爱辉等县，出现过大面积水稻平均每亩产六百六十斤的高产纪录。
    黑龙江省一年种植一季水稻是很紧张的。在气温正常的年头，晚霜一停止就开始播种，在水稻成熟后几天内早霜就会来到，这期间只要在任何一个生产环节上延误几天，生产就大受威胁。解放十二年来，农业部门经过整理、培育和选拔，繁殖了多种早熟的水稻品种，像“小北海”、“国光”两个品种种下后，只要九十几天就可以成熟，因此即使在北部的呼玛县也有了种植水稻的可能。另外，这里的农民还采取了许多办法，缩短了水稻生育时间和收获期。
