    Jottings

    Can it come true?

    Eisenhower and Republican congressional leaders, in a meeting, predicted this year's U.S. economy, saying that although there may be some recession in the first half of the year, the second half "will significantly rebound."

    Why is it certain that the second half of the year will "significantly rebound"? This is not difficult to understand, because the U.S. President has already budgeted 74 billion U.S. dollars for the next U.S. fiscal year starting in the second half of the year, of which 40 billion will be for military expenditures, in order to stop the recession of the U.S. economy.

    People remember that in the past year, the U.S. ruling group also pinned its hopes on the second half of the year to stop the economic recession that began at the beginning of the year, but this hope was dashed. So, can this year’s increase of only 8 billion U.S. dollars in military expenditure make the U.S. President's prediction for the U.S. economy particularly accurate?

    Ulterior Motives

    Ray Wicker, a reporter for the U.S. "Wall Street Journal," recently wrote in an article that U.S. private investment in Australia has increased by 25% since 1955, because "the supply of British foreign investment capital has decreased." The material provided by Wicker is just one glimpse of the overall picture of American capital infiltration into the British Commonwealth.

    Why has British foreign investment decreased? Macmillan once admitted that heavy military expenditure is an important reason. It seems that the United States welcomes Britain to become a "nuclear power," not to mention, it at least has such advantages: letting the burden of armaments plunge Britain's finances into trouble, and Britain's economic interests in the Commonwealth will slowly fall into the hands of the United States.

    Vicious Dreams

    U.S. Senator Johnson told Democratic senators on the 7th that the current U.S. congressional session must make a decision to compete with the Soviet Union for control of outer space in order to "completely control" the earth. The method of control is to "cause drought or flood on the earth, change tides and raise sea levels, change river courses, and turn mild climates into severe winters."

    Johnson's vicious dreams are the most typical portrayal of the wolfish ambitions of imperialists in the atomic age. After the failure of their atomic "deterrence policy," they even want to run to outer space to realize their goal of "controlling" the earth and enslaving all mankind.

    However, Johnson and his ilk have obviously forgotten: Can the socialist countries that have already entered outer space allow them to realize such arrogant ambitions?

    Casino on the Moon

    "Widely open casinos" will appear on the moon. This is not crazy talk. Recently, Dr. Wernher von Braun made this unusual prediction at a meeting in the United States where seven major scientists discussed the scientific development in 2057.

    When people are envisioning the wonderful prospects of mankind conquering the universe, Wernher von Braun thinks of gambling, which is not accidental. Because, for him, scientific endeavors are just a kind of bet. At the beginning, he bet on Hitler and built V-2 rockets for the Nazis. He lost this game. He then changed his bet to the United States and became the director of the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This game has also been lost now. The mood of a frustrated gambler took him into the realm of fantasy, wanting to find satisfaction from it.

    能够灵验吗？
    艾森豪威尔和共和党国会领袖们在一次会议中为今年美国的经济算了一个命，说是虽然上半年可能发生一些衰退现象，但下半年“将要显著地回升”。
    为什么算定下半年准会“显著地回升”呢？这是不难理解的，因为美国总统已经为从下半年开始的美国下一个财政年度制定了七百四十亿美元的预算，其中军费即占四百亿，以便阻止住美国经济的衰退。
    人们记得，在过去的一年中，美国统治集团也曾把阻止从年初开始的经济衰退的希望寄托在下半年，但是这种希望落空了。那么，今年仅仅靠增加八十亿元军费就能使美国总统为美国经济算的命特别灵验吗？
    别有用心
    美国“华尔街日报”的记者雷·维克尔最近在一篇文章里写道，美国在澳大利亚的私人投资从1955年以来增加了25％，其原因是“英国国外投资资本的供应减少了”。维克尔所提供的材料，不过是美国资本渗入英联邦的全豹之一斑。
    英国对外投资为什么会减少了呢？麦克米伦曾经承认，军费沉重是重要原因之一。由此看来，美国欢迎英国成为“核子强国”，别的不说，至少有这样的妙处：让军备负担使英国的财政陷入困境，英国在英联邦的经济利益也就慢慢落到美国手里来了。
    狠毒的梦想
    美国参议员约翰逊7日对民主党的参议员们说，美国本届国会会议必须作出决定，和苏联争夺外层空间控制权，以便对地球“实行完全的控制”。控制的办法是：在地球上“造成旱灾或水灾，改变潮流和提高海平面，改变河道，使温和的气候变为严冬”。
    约翰逊的狠毒的梦想，是原子时代帝国主义者狼子野心的最典型的写照。他们在原子“威慑政策”失败之后，竟想跑到外层空间去实现他们“控制”地球和奴役全人类的目的。
    但是，约翰逊之流显然忘记了：已经进入外层空间的社会主义国家能够容许他们实现这种狂妄的野心吗？
    月亮上的赌场
    月亮上将出现“广泛开放的赌场”。这并不是疯话。最近，韦尔纳·布劳恩博士在美国七个主要科学家座谈2057年科学发展情况的会议上作了这个不寻常的预言。
    当人们都在设想人类征服宇宙的美妙前景时，韦尔纳·布劳恩想到了赌博，这并不是偶然的。因为，对他说来，科学事业也不过是一种赌注而已。开始时，他把宝押在希特勒身上，为纳粹制造了V—2式火箭。这一局输掉了。他又把宝改押在美国身上，当了美国陆军弹道导弹局局长。这一局，现在也输掉了。失意的赌徒的心情把他带进了幻想的境界，想从那里面找到满足。
