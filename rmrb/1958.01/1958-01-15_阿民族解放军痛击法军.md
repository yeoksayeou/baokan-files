Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 14th: The Algerian National Liberation Army continues to engage in fierce battles with the French colonial army. The fighting in the areas of Oran and northern Saida is particularly intense.

On the 11th, a strong unit of the Liberation Army clashed with a French patrol unit near the Algerian-Tunisian border. The French troops were surrounded. According to official French materials, twelve French soldiers were killed and five were captured by the Liberation Army in this battle. Only after a large number of French reinforcements and aircraft arrived did the surrounded French troops break through. Fighting also took place in Ténès, Cap Djinet, Mount Tarf, and Boufarik (Algiers and Constantine provinces).

The French newspaper "Libération," commenting on the situation in Algeria, said that the Algerian National Liberation Army is stubbornly resisting the French army. The newspaper pointed out that a policy of military suppression will not solve the problem. The only correct path to solving the Algerian problem is to negotiate with the representatives of the Algerian people.

    阿民族解放军痛击法军
    新华社14日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军同法国殖民军继续进行激战。阿兰省和北赛伊达地区的战斗特别激烈。
    一支强有力的解放军部队11日在阿尔及利亚和突尼斯边境附近同法军的一个巡逻部队发生战斗。法军被围困。据法国官方发表的材料，法军在这次战斗中有十二人被击毙，五人被解放军俘虏。直到大批法国援军和飞机赶来之后，被围的法军才突围出来。在特尼耶特哈德、崩角、塔尔弗山和布法里克（阿尔及尔和康士但丁省）也发生了战事。
    法国“解放报”在评论阿尔及利亚形势时说：阿尔及利亚民族解放军正在顽强地抵抗法国军队。这家报纸指出：军事镇压政策解决不了问题。解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一正确道路就是同阿尔及利亚人民的代表进行谈判。
