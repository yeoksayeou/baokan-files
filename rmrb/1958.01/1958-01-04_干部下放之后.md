    After greatly streamlining the organizational structures of factories and mines, many cadres have been sent down to workshops to directly participate in production. What changes have these people brought to the enterprises by engaging in production? What changes have they themselves undergone? To understand this situation, I visited some of the cadres who were sent down at the Gansu Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Factory.
    The Gansu Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Factory, based on the principles of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and training and reforming cadres, began sending down more than eighty cadres from offices and workshops (accounting for 50% of the original enterprise management personnel) starting in April of last year, including technicians, accountants, typists, general administrative cadres, deputy workshop directors, and section chiefs. In addition, more than thirty new graduates from secondary vocational and technical schools were also sent down. These cadres who were sent down generally can endure hardship, are not afraid of fatigue, and are not afraid of getting dirty. They abide by labor discipline and have earned the praise of the workers. Those who had never engaged in physical labor before have received labor education and have been tempered and reformed in working alongside the workers. They all have a certain level of education, so they are relatively quick to master techniques, and many have been able to operate lathes independently. In particular, cadres who were promoted from among the veteran workers have become shock troops for solving major technical problems after returning to production posts, playing a significant role in promoting the enterprise's production.
    Old Masters Display Their Skills Again
    The return of veteran masters who have been sent down to the production front is especially welcome. Most of them have ten to twenty years of experience and were originally production experts. However, in recent years, as the enterprise has developed from a simple repair shop into a machinery manufacturing factory, and the number of employees has expanded from less than one hundred to more than one thousand, these veteran workers have been promoted to leadership positions, serving as section chiefs and workshop directors. In these positions, they are busy with administrative affairs and unable to exert their expertise, while also weakening the technical strength of production. Now that they have returned to production posts, they have quickly become a reliable force for solving technical problems, and good news continues to pour in. The story of Zhang Zhengyi casting a cupola furnace is an example that is often cited in conversations.
    In September, the casting workshop encountered a major production problem: the supply of molten iron could not meet the demand. As workers became more skilled in making new products, the output increased dramatically. The production of heating boiler sections increased from eight to ten sections per day, and the number of heating fins increased from 350 to 600, but the molten iron used for casting blanks was far behind. All of the factory's cupola furnaces were utilized, but they could only melt fifteen tons of molten iron per day, while production required twenty-eight tons. If this problem was not resolved, not only would the casting workshop be idle, but even the factory workshops responsible for machining would also be in a state of semi-shutdown. At this time, Zhang Zhengyi, a veteran master who had previously served as a section chief, stepped forward and said that he could cast a cupola furnace and put it into production quickly. Zhang Zhengyi is an old foundry worker with twenty years of experience and has worked with many furnaces, so the workshop entrusted him with the task with great confidence. According to the conditions of the agricultural tool factory, it would take a month to design and draw a blueprint for such a furnace, and half a month to make a model, which would take too long. In order to save time, Zhang Zhengyi did not ask anyone to design and draw a blueprint, nor did he ask anyone to make a model. After discussing with a few people, he used his experience to scrape the outer skin and inner core in the pit and cast it. Later, he equipped it with two small blowers that had been stockpiled in the factory for a long time, and it was put into production in about a month, supplying the casting workshop with thirteen tons of molten iron per day, with a maximum of fifteen tons of molten iron. This key problem related to the completion of the entire factory's production tasks was quickly solved by the veteran worker.
    In addition to providing a guarantee for solving major technical problems, these veteran workers who have been sent down have also created favorable conditions for improving the overall technical level of the factory. Many workers were very happy to see them sent down and were willing to apprentice to them and learn techniques from them. Through their specific guidance and demonstrations, the operating level of the factory's workers will certainly be greatly improved in the future.
    Those Who Wielded Pens are Catching Up with Workers
    If the veteran workers are like veteran soldiers, and they become vigorous and active as soon as they go to the production front, then the general administrative cadres who have been sent down are like new recruits, and they need a period of training to become true combatants. However, these "new recruits" are different from ordinary "new recruits." They have a certain level of education and have worked in offices for many years, so they are more likely to discover problems in their work and help leaders solve them, becoming assistants to workshop leaders. Fu Mingliang is an example. He used to work in the personnel section and is now sent down to the seed drill workshop. The work group he was in was always behind the other work groups. Other groups could lathe six or seven pieces of heating boiler sections, but they could only lathe four or five pieces. What was the reason? He thought about it for a long time and saw some problems, but in order to turn his views into a consensus and mobilize everyone to find solutions together, he called a meeting to study the issue together. After a discussion, things became clear. The reason was that his work group had long auxiliary time during work hours and the production order was chaotic. Tools were not prepared in advance and had to be found after work started, wasting a lot of effort. There was no fixed division of labor within the group, and movers sometimes did the work of lathe operators, and lathe operators pulled chain hoists, forming a chaotic situation. Based on this situation, everyone formulated improvement measures and consciously abided by them. As a result, their output quickly increased to seven pieces. Later, although three people were transferred from their group, they were still able to maintain such a high number. It is believable that as these cadres grow longer with the time of exercising, many of them will become backbone elements in production, and their role in enterprise production will become more obvious, becoming a new force.
    Of course, these comrades also encountered some difficulties in the labor process. But more importantly, these difficulties have made them stronger and more courageous. Zhao Junru, who used to work in the Party Committee, can represent the road that many comrades have experienced in the process of training. Zhao Junru had been studying since he was a child and had never done any heavy physical labor. This time, when he was sent down to the hillside plow workshop, he really felt tired when he operated it on the first day. A plow beam weighs four or five kilograms, and the plow beam, plowshare, plow support, and plow mold add up to fourteen or fifteen kilograms. Not only do you have to drag such a heavy thing back and forth, but also install it on it. The edge of a plow support was not neat, so he took it to the grinding wheel to grind it. As soon as the plow support touched the grinding wheel, it was forced away, and he staggered suddenly, almost falling. Then he went to grind it again, and one hand was too strong, and the plow support slid to one side, and the grinding wheel tore a glove completely. That day, he was very discouraged. After the Party Secretary found out, he asked: In the years of war, many comrades risked their lives for the revolution, and they did not even care about their lives. Do we not have the courage to overcome this difficulty today? This was a very severe criticism and an encouragement. He regained his courage and returned to his post. After more than twenty days of training, he slowly got used to it. Now, the number of hillside plows he installs has increased from thirty or forty to sixty-six, and his efficiency has increased by about half. This beginning has laid the foundation for him to become a worker who masters technology. He told me with great confidence: "It is still impossible to reach the level of ordinary workers now, but I will be able to do it soon!"
    A More Practical Classroom
    "The state spent a lot of money to train us, and now it wants us to be workers. Isn't this a waste! If I had known this, why should I have studied!" Many students thought this way before participating in physical labor. Some people said it publicly, and some people muttered it behind their backs. Although they had discussed this issue in school, the ideological problems of some people had not been resolved. After participating in a period of actual labor, they generally reflected that the workshop is a more practical classroom.
    Xu Yaoguo, who is working in the seeder workshop, is a very quiet young man who just graduated from Lanzhou Industrial School last year. Thanks to his efforts and his willingness to learn from the veteran workers, he and another worker recently created a record of lathing three hundred and twenty pieces of heating fins (generally, they can only lathe about one hundred and ten pieces). He told me about his experience in this stage: "Seeing it a thousand times is not as good as doing it once. When you actually operate it, you encounter many problems and learn many things. What kind of work to lathe? What kind of knife to use? What speed to use on the lathe? These things are talked about a lot in books. But when you get to the lathe, you are dumbfounded and flustered. Although the veteran masters cannot explain these basic principles, they have accumulated rich experience. We can truly master the technology only by combining the theory in the books with the experience of the veteran masters through actual operation."
    "Actual operation has also overcome some of my subjective ideas. For example..." Xu Yaoguo continued to help me understand his meaning: "When we first came out of school, we always thought of everything as very ideal, but this kind of ideal is often divorced from reality. When we entered the workshop and saw the fixture of the three-eyed boring machine, we felt it was too clumsy. After boring one side, we unloaded it, clamped it again, and bored the other side. This was too inconvenient! It would be better to change it to a mobile type or a rotary type. At first, I thought it was quite simple. But after working in the workshop for a few days, I realized that the problem was not that simple. If it is changed to a mobile type, it will be blocked by the screw shaft. If it is changed to a rotary type, it will inevitably be large, heavy, and uneconomical. Now, if I were asked to start improving this tool, I would have to consider these factors and would never be so rash."
    Every student who participates in physical labor can talk about many similar experiences. After these students are trained in this way, they will certainly be able to write and fight: sitting in the office drawing and designing, they are technical personnel with practical experience; returning to the workshop for actual operation, they are workers with theoretical knowledge.

    干部下放之后
    燕树桂
    厂矿企业大力紧缩机构之后，有许多干部下放到车间直接参加生产。这些人从事生产，对企业带来哪些变化？他们自己本人又有哪些变化？为了了解这方面的情况，我访问了甘肃省农具制造厂一些下放干部。
    甘肃省农具制造厂本着勤俭办企业和锻炼改造干部的方针，从去年4月间开始，先后下放了八十多名科室车间干部（占原有企业管理人员50％），包括技术员、会计、打字员、一般行政干部、车间副主任、工段长。另外还下放了三十多名新由中等专业技术学校毕业出来的学生。这些下放干部，一般都能吃苦，不怕累，不怕脏，遵守劳动纪律，得到工人的好评。一向没有从事过体力劳动的，在和工人一块操作中，受到了劳动教育，得到锻炼和改造。他们都具有一定的文化水平，所以在掌握技术上都比较快，有不少人已能够在车床上单独操作。特别是由老工人当中提拔起来的干部，重返生产岗位之后，变成了解决重大技术问题的突击队，对企业的生产起着很大的推动作用。
    老师傅重显身手
    下放的老师傅，重返生产战线，特别受到欢迎。他们大部分都有十多年到二十年的工龄，原来是生产上的能手。但是近几年来，这些老工人随着企业由一个简陋的修配厂发展成为一个机械制造厂、职工从不到一百人扩大到一千多人，纷纷被提拔到领导岗位，担任了工段长和车间主任。在这些工作岗位上，他们忙于行政事务，无法发挥他们的专长，同时也削弱了生产上的技术力量。现在他们重新回到生产岗位上，很快成为解决技术问题的可靠力量，喜讯不断传来。张正义浇铸冲天化铁炉的事迹，便是人们在交谈中经常被引用的一个事例。
    9月间，铸工车间生产上遇到一个很大的问题：铁水供不应求。由于工人在制作新产品中，技术日趋熟练，产量突飞猛进的增加，暖气锅炉片一天由八片上升到十片，暖气片由三百五十片增加到六百片，浇铸毛胚用的铁水却远远的落在后面。厂里几个化铁炉全部利用起来，一天只能化出十五吨铁水，而生产上需要二十八吨。这个问题如果不解决，不仅铸工车间要窝工，连负责给加工的工厂车间也要陷于半停工状态。这时原来担任工段长的老师傅张正义挺身而出，说他可以浇铸一个化铁炉很快投入生产。张正义是个老铸工，有二十年的工龄，手里翻过不少炉子，车间便很信任的交给他。按农具厂的条件，要做这样一个炉子，设计绘图得一个月，作模型得半个月，时间拖得太长。张正义为了赶时间，没有找人设计绘图，更没有找人做模型，和几个人合计了一下，根据经验，用刮板在地坑里刮成外皮和里芯，就浇铸起来。后来又把厂里积压很久的两个小型鼓风机给配备上，先后一个月的光景就投入了生产，每日供应铸工车间十三吨铁水，最高化到十五吨铁水。这一下关系到全厂生产任务完成好坏的关键性问题，很快在老工人手里解决了。
    这些下放的老工人，除了为解决重大技术问题提供了保证以外，还为提高全厂技术水平创造了有利条件。很多工人看到他们下放非常高兴，都愿意拜他们为师傅，跟他们学习技术。通过他们的具体指导和示范，全厂工人的操作水平今后一定会有很大的提高。
    摇笔杆的快赶上工人
    如果说老工人像老战士一样，他们一上到生产战线就像生龙活虎一般，那末下放的一般行政干部就是刚入伍的新兵，要成为一个真正的战斗员还需要一个时期的锻炼。但是这些“新兵”，毕竟还和一般的“新兵”不同，他们都有一定的文化水平，又在科室工作过多年，所以他们在工作中就比较能发现一些问题，帮助领导解决，成为车间领导的助手。傅明亮就是一个例子，他原在人事科工作，现在下放到播种机车间。他所在的工组老是赶不上别的工组，别的组车暖气锅炉片车到六、七片，他们总是四、五片。什么原因呢？他想了很久，也看出一些问题，但是为了把自己的看法变成大家一致的看法，动员大家一起想办法，便召集全组一块儿开会研究。一讨论，事情弄明了，原因是自己这个工组在工作时间辅助时间长，生产秩序乱。工具事前没有准备好，上班才找，浪费不少工夫。组内大家没有固定的分工，搬运工一会儿干起车工活，车工又拉起倒链，形成一窝蜂。根据这个情况，大家制订出改进的办法，每个人都自觉的遵守。这样一来，他们的产量很快的升到七片，后来他们组虽然调出三个人，但仍然能够保持这样高的数字。可以相信，这些干部随着锻炼时间的增长，将有不少人会成为生产上的骨干分子，他们在企业生产上的作用也将更明显的表示出来，成为一支新生力量。
    当然，这些同志在劳动过程中也遇到一些困难。但是更主要的，这些困难使得他们变得更坚强了，更勇敢了。以前在党委会工作的赵俊儒的锻炼过程，便可以代表许多同志所经历的这段道路。赵俊儒从小一直念书，重的体力活啥也没有干过。这次下放到山地犁车间，当他第一天操作时，确实感到累的慌。一个犁辕就是四五公斤，犁辕、犁铧、犁托、犁镜加在一起，又是十四五公斤。这样笨重的东西，不仅要拖来拖去翻来翻去，而且要在上面安装。有个犁托边沿不整齐，拿到砂轮跟前去磨，犁托刚挨上砂轮被逼跑了，猛不防打个趔趄，险些跌倒。接着再去磨去，一个手用力过猛，犁托滑到一边，砂轮把一支手套全给划破了。这一天，他非常灰心。党委书记发觉后，问道：在战争的年月里，许多同志为了革命出生入死，连性命都不顾，难道今天这个困难我们都没有勇气克服？这是很严厉的批评，也是一个鼓励。他重新鼓着勇气回到工作岗位，经过二十多天的锻炼，慢慢习惯了。现在他安装山地犁的件数，已由三四十部上升到六十六部，效率提高了约一半左右。这个开端，已为他成为一个掌握技术的工人奠定了基础。他很有信心的告诉我说：“现在要和一般工人拉平还不行，不过不久就能做到这一点！”
    更实际的课堂
    “国家拿出很多钱把我们培养出来，现在又叫当工人，这不是浪费！早知如此，何必读书！”不少学生在参加体力劳动之前这样想。有的人公开讲出来，有的人背地里嘀咕。虽然他们在学校里就这个问题进行过讨论，但有些人的思想问题并未得到解决。在参加了一个阶段的实际劳动之后，他们普遍反映：车间是更实际的课堂。
    正在播种车间工作的徐耀国，是个很沉静的青年，去年才从兰州工业学校毕业出来。由于他的努力，虚心地向老工人学习，最近他和另外一个工人曾创造了车暖气片车到三百二十片的纪录（一般只能车到一百一十片左右）。他向我叙述这一阶段的体会道：“眼过千遍，不如手过一遍。具体一操作，碰到的问题多，学到东西也多。车什么样的活？用什么样的刀子？车床上用什么速度？这在书本上讲的很多。但是一到车床跟前，就傻了眼，慌了手脚，老师傅虽然对这些基本道理讲不出来，却积累有丰富的经验。我们通过实际操作，把书本上的理论和老师傅的经验结合在一起，才算真正的掌握了技术。”
    “实际操作还克服了我的一些主观主义的想法。打个比方说……”徐耀国为了帮助我了解他的意思，继续讲道：“我们刚出学校，把一切总想的很理想，但是这种理想常常脱离实际。一进车间，看见三眼镗床的夹具，就觉得太笨，把这一面镗好后，卸下来，再夹住，再镗另一面，这多不方便！干脆改为移动式的，或者改为旋转式的。起初倒觉得挺简单。但是在车间工作了几天，才发觉这个问题并不那样简单。改为移动式的，有螺丝轴挡着，改为旋转式的，势必很大，笨重，不经济。现在要叫我着手改进这个工具，像这些因素就得考虑进去，绝不会那样贸然。”
    类似这样的体会，每个参加体力劳动的学生都能谈出很多。这些学生经过这样培养之后，一定会能文能武：坐在办公室里绘图设计，是个具有实际经验的技术人员；回到车间实际操作，又是一个具有理论知识的工人。
