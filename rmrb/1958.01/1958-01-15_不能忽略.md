    Cannot be Ignored
    Zu Nian
    Since the promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, it has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to actively learn culture. They say, "Increased production is the center, technology is the most important, and without culture, it won't work." This shows that farmers have deeply realized that to improve agricultural production technology and increase grain production, they must improve their cultural level.
    Starting in 1956, our country will basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people within twelve years. Many rural areas have organized the broad masses of farmers to learn to read in winter, according to different circumstances. However, the farmers' high enthusiasm for learning culture has not been valued by the leadership in some areas. They formally arrange the literacy work, and after organizing it, they don't pay attention to it anymore. In some places, because problems such as teachers, kerosene, evening heating, and desks and chairs have not been well resolved, the number of farmers going to school has gradually decreased, and those who are studying are not focused. Farmers are dissatisfied with this situation. They criticize, "Enter school in winter, collapse in spring, enter school every winter, start from scratch every year."
    This shortcoming must be corrected. We must meet the farmers' urgent demand for learning culture and carry out this work with revolutionary vigor. We must fully recognize the economic and political significance of turning agricultural laborers into cultured farmers. Eliminating illiteracy may seem to have temporary contradictions with the immediate production work, but in fact, it has long-term benefits. A visionary leader should not ignore this point.

    全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，更加鼓舞了广大农民积极学文化的热情。他们说，“增产是中心，技术最要紧，没文化可不行”。这说明农民们已经深深地认识到要提高农业生产技术，增产粮食，必须提高自己的文化水平。
    从1956年开始，我国将分别在十二年内，基本上扫除青年和壮年中的文盲。很多农村都按照不同情况，组织广大农民入冬学识字。但是，农民这种积极学文化的高涨情绪，在一部分地区，并没有被领导部门所重视。他们把扫盲工作形式上安排一下，组织起来以后就不去过问了。某些地方，由于教师、灯油、晚间取暖、桌椅等问题没有得到很好解决，农民上学的人数渐渐少了，在学的人也不专心了。对于这种状况，农民是不满意的。他们批评说，“冬入学，春垮台，年年入冬学，年年从头来”。
    这个缺点必须纠正，我们要满足农民学文化的迫切要求，要拿出革命的干劲来进行这项工作。必须充分认识。把农业劳动者变成有文化的农民的经济和政治的意义。扫除文盲对于眼前的生产工作，乍看起来有暂时的矛盾，实际上却有长远的好处。有预见的领导者是不应该忽视这一点的。
