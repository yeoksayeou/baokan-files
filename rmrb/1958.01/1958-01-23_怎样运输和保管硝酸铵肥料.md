    How to Transport and Store Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer
    Ammonium nitrate is a chemical fertilizer and also an explosive, prone to deterioration or explosion. Therefore, extra care should be taken when transporting and storing this item.
    1. Do not mix with oils, metals, wood shavings, dry firewood, rags, oily rags, etc.
    2. Do not place on heated brick beds or near stoves.
    3. Ammonium nitrate is hygroscopic and can absorb moisture from the air or ground and melt, so the storage area should be dry and the bag openings should be sealed tightly. If the bag has been opened, it can be placed in a waterproof container.
    4. The warehouse should be ventilated. Ammonium nitrate should not be mixed with lime or wood ash to avoid reducing its effectiveness as fertilizer.
    5. There should be no fire in the warehouse where ammonium nitrate is stored, no smoking indoors, and it should not be too hot.
    6. Stacks should not be too high; a stack is best at around ten to fifteen bags. Too high, and it easily forms large clumps.
    7. If it has already formed large clumps, it can be dissolved in water or broken up with a wooden hammer; if using an iron hammer, a wooden board must be placed underneath, as sparks may cause an explosion.
    8. If damage or melting is found, it should be promptly removed and the bags replaced, re-sewing them securely.

    怎样运输和保管硝酸铵肥料
    硝酸铵是化学肥料，也是一种炸药，容易变质或爆炸。因此，在运输和保管这种物品的时候要加倍小心。
    1．不可和油类、金属、木屑、干柴、破布、油抹布等混在一起。
    2．不可放在热炕上或炉灶旁边。
    3．硝酸铵有吸湿性，能够吸收空气中或地上的水分而熔化，因此保管的地方要干燥，袋口要封严。如果已经拆开袋子，可以放在不漏水的容器里。
    4．仓库应该通风。硝酸铵不能和石灰、草木灰混在一起，以免降低肥效。
    5．放硝酸铵的仓库，不能有火，屋里不能吸烟，不要太热。
    6．堆垛不能太高，一垛最好在十袋到十五袋左右。因为太高容易结大块。
    7．如已结成大块，可以用水溶解或用木锤打碎；如果用铁锤打，就要加木板垫着，如果打出火花来会引起爆炸。
    8．发现破损或溶化现象，应该及时取出换袋子，重新缝好。
