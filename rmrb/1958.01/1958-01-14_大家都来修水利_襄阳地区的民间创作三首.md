Everyone Participate in Water Conservancy Construction
Three Folk Creations from Xiangyang Area

    Black Cyan River
      Xie Chaojiang
    Black Cyan River, "Black-hearted River," caused much disaster in the old society. Whenever summer and autumn came, it flooded and caused havoc beyond remedy, submerging tens of thousands of acres of fertile land, causing a life of food and clothing shortage. Black Cyan River, River of Happiness, many good things in the new society. A rolling dam is built to block the river, irrigating more than ten thousand acres of fertile land, from then on, the banks are free from flooding, singing songs of bumper harvest every year.

  Love Song
      Chu Chuanfa
    A pair of mandarin ducks floating on the water, the younger sister digging soil, the older brother carrying it, digging fast and running diligently, carrying a lot and digging well. The bright red sun is about to set, the sister helps the older brother light the fire, the older brother returns home to lift the lid of the pot, joy in his heart, smile on his face: "I know what she is thinking, I will work harder tomorrow."

    Old Man Wang and Zhang San
      Huang Rui
    Old Man Wang, fifty-seven, very active in water conservancy construction, originally digging three and a half cubic meters a day, later digging four and seven-tenths cubic meters. There is a commune member named Zhang San, young and strong but very passive, working hard with his head but not his back, only digging two and one-tenth cubic meters a day. One is old but not in spirit, the other is young but afraid to work, four and seven-tenths, two and one-tenth, it seems this matter is quite strange! Zhang San was so ashamed that he didn't answer, Zhang San was so ashamed that cold sweat dripped.

    大家都来修水利
    襄阳地区的民间创作三首
    黑青河
      谢朝江黑青河，“黑心河”，旧社会里祸害多，每当夏秋季节到，泛滥成灾没奈何，万亩良田被淹没，缺吃少穿实难过。黑青河，幸福河，新社会里好事多，拦河筑起滚水坝，灌溉良田一万多，从此两岸不受淹，年年欢唱丰收歌。
  情歌
      褚传发一对鸳鸯水上飘，干妹挖土干哥挑，挖得快来跑得勤，挑得多来挖得好。艳艳红日快下山，妹帮干哥把火烧，干哥回家揭锅盖，喜在心头，笑上眉梢：“她的心思我知道，明天更要加油搞。”王老汉和张三
      黄锐王老汉，五十七，兴修水利很积极，原来一天三方三，后来挖到四方七。有个社员叫张三，年青体壮很消极，干活头出腰不出，一天只挖两方一。一个年老心不老，一个年青怕出力，四方七，二方一，看来这事多稀奇！羞得张三不答话，羞得张三冷汗滴。
