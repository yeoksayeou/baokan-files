Title: Strange Logic

A United Press reporter named Gonzales, in order to dilute the huge impact of the Soviet peace proposals, suddenly concocted a marvelous logic. He said that the Soviet Union's recent peace proposals were all put forward "on the eve of so-called 'major Western events'," and were therefore "suspicious." The major events he was referring to were: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris Conference, the U.S. President's State of the Union Address, the Baghdad Pact Ankara Conference, etc.

This kind of argument is naturally not worth a smile. The reason why Gonzales had such a "discovery" is actually because the Soviet Union is constantly making efforts for peace and constantly putting forward peace proposals; while the United States is constantly stepping up its plans for arms expansion and war preparation, and constantly creating "major events" that obstruct the easing of the international situation.

    怪逻辑
    合众社记者冈萨雷斯为了冲淡苏联和平建议的巨大影响，忽然创造了一个奇妙的逻辑。他说，苏联最近的和平建议都是在所谓“西方重大事件前夕”提出的，因而是“可疑”的。他所指的重大事件，就是：北大西洋集团巴黎会议，美国总统国情咨文，巴格达条约安卡拉会议等等。
    这种论调自然是不值一哂的。冈萨雷斯所以有这样的“发现”，其实是因为苏联不断在为和平进行努力，不断提出和平建议；而美国却是不断在加紧策划扩军备战，不断制造阻挠国际局势缓和的“重大事件”。
