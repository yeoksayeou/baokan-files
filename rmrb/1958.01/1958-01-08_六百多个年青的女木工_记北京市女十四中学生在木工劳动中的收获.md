Over Six Hundred Young Female Carpenters
    ——A Record of the Achievements of Students at Beijing Girls’ No. 14 Middle School in Carpentry Labor
    By Our Reporter Sun Zunian

    In the classrooms, libraries, and teachers' offices of Beijing Girls' No. 14 Middle School, one can see captivating and exquisite small wooden bookshelves and torch-shaped towel racks. When strangers see these items for the first time, they always ask curiously, "Where did you buy these unique items?" And the answer they hear is always: "These items were created by our first-year junior high school students with their intelligence and hardworking hands during carpentry labor practice classes. Telling you the whole story would take a while!"

    In order to cultivate young students into laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and good health, the teachers of Girls’ No. 14 Middle School attach great importance to labor education. Since the beginning of the school year on September 1st the year before last, carpentry labor practice classes have been added to the twelve classes of the first year of junior high school.

    Initially, the students had insufficient understanding of the purpose and significance of carpentry labor practice classes. Many people thought that carpenters in society were all men, and they had never seen any female carpenters! We are all girls, are we all going to be carpenters after graduation? That would be so uncivilized! If it wasn't for becoming carpenters in the future, what is the benefit of learning carpentry now? It is truly a superfluous course that will hinder the learning of other courses!

    Everyone approached this course with different moods. However, carpentry labor requires using both hands to make a product from pieces of wood, which cannot be dealt with perfunctorily! At first, the students braced themselves and frowned when they picked up the planes and saws, because if the plane was not properly controlled, the planed surface would not be smooth and flat, and if the saw was not properly controlled, it would not saw straight. Sometimes, their hands were blistered, and they were covered in sweat, but they could not meet the standard requirements. Student Xu Shufen used the plane and applied too much force forward, causing the wood to curl up like fish scales, and she was so anxious that she was covered in sweat, but she couldn't plane it flat. Student Wang Guixian stared blankly at the wood with unfamiliar tools—plane, saw, wooden hammer—and dared not start. Even when she did, it took a lot of effort, and the wood was still a mess. She thought, "How difficult it is to make a beautiful finished product!" Everyone felt the same as Xu and Wang, and they were not interested in carpentry labor practice classes, nor did they have the confidence to truly learn carpentry in this course. In the beginning, every student looked forward to the end-of-class bell as soon as they entered the carpentry class.

    Teacher Song, who taught carpentry labor practice classes, was very clear about these feelings of the students. Facing a group of innocent and lively female students, what should he do? He felt that his responsibility was to cultivate students' interest and feelings for labor in the process of carpentry labor and gradually change their ideas of belittling carpentry labor. Therefore, whenever the students became impatient, Teacher Song always patiently guided them, explaining to everyone and demonstrating for them the specific knowledge of how to design, compose, and operate various tools, in order to inspire the students to study hard and love labor.

    Although the students participating in carpentry labor practice classes had learned various units of measurement in arithmetic, their understanding was very abstract, and they could not apply them in practice. The first time they made mailboxes for the post office, they were not clear about how many centimeters or millimeters were in a meter, or the relationship between a meter and a meter. As a result, everyone treated millimeters as centimeters and meters as ten thousand millimeters. Designing drawings according to such a scale would make a mailbox ten times larger, making it a box for clothes rather than a mailbox. In labor, everyone learned from the teacher's methods of using tools that the reason they couldn't plane flat or saw straight was because they were using too much force. Therefore, they gradually learned to stabilize the tools and apply force evenly during operation. This was not only less laborious, but also allowed them to plane and saw straight. When everyone learned to use tools, make a material, and finally synthesize a finished product, they deeply felt that carpentry labor could not rely on brute force alone, but also required skill! After such labor practice, the students suddenly realized that taking carpentry labor practice classes was not simply for becoming a carpenter, but to connect with reality, consolidate what they had learned, cultivate an understanding of basic production knowledge, and exercise labor skills, laying a further foundation for the future learning of other subjects. From then on, the students became very interested in and passionate about the carpentry labor class, and no one said it was a superfluous course anymore. Every time this lesson came, the students worked with concentration. When six hundred and thirty-six brightly lacquered mailboxes were neatly placed on the operating table, everyone faced their labor achievements and jumped up happily, saying: Even being a carpenter is glorious!

    Over the past year, the students have also made 174 wooden bookshelves, 55 torch-shaped towel racks, 56 erasers, 24 fish seedling boxes, 28 coat hangers, and 24 starting blocks for races. These utensils and teaching aids have played a direct role in teaching and created nearly one thousand yuan of wealth for the school.

    More than six hundred first-year students have gained a lot from the carpentry labor practice classes. A new atmosphere of loving labor, loving science and technology, and cherishing public property has emerged among the students. In the past, Girls' No. 14 Middle School always found that the desks and chairs in the first-year classes were the most damaged at the end of the semester, but last semester, due to learning carpentry, they realized the difficulty of making finished products and knew how to take care of them. As a result, when checking during last summer vacation, very few desks and chairs were damaged. If you want to find some students and ask them to talk about the gains of carpentry labor, they will talk endlessly.

    One day, when I was having lunch, I ran into four students, Wang Guixian, Liu Meiyu, Xu Shufen, and Zhang Shurong. I asked them what they had gained from labor? Wang Guixian thought for a while and then said to me: "Take arithmetic, for example, the scales and unit conversions we learned in the past have been further consolidated in the application of carpentry labor. Also, carpentry labor has added practical knowledge to our current second-year botany, geometry, and physics, making it easier to understand!" At this time, Liu Meiyu suddenly interjected: "In the past, I didn't understand the carpentry labor practice class and the benefits it had for learning other subjects, so I was annoyed every time this lesson came. I have always disliked labor. Once at home, my younger sister blamed me, saying that a girl as big as me opens her mouth to eat and reaches out for clothes, and that the older sister should do more housework for her parents than her younger sister. I angrily replied, not necessarily, who told you that! Since participating in the school's carpentry labor class, I have seen that every product is created by the students' hands. At this time, I realized that my attitude towards my sister was wrong, and I felt ashamed for not working. From then on, I changed my habit of disliking labor. I actively participate in physical labor at school, and when I go home after school, I always try to find time to help with housework in addition to reviewing my lessons. Soon, my father came to school to praise me to the teacher! Once, my younger brother's extracurricular study group collectively reviewed their lessons at my home. One of the classmates' brother-in-law was a carpenter, and everyone was sarcastically laughing at his brother-in-law for being hopeless and becoming a small carpenter! I couldn't bear it, so I walked over and said righteously, what's so funny about being a carpenter? Think about it, without carpenters, could you study well today? Would there be desks and chairs in the classroom? Would there be good school buildings? Can any of our country's major construction projects do without carpenters? I also cited many examples of school carpentry labor. After I said this, the elementary school students said repeatedly, Sister, sister, we were wrong, we promise you that we will no longer despise working people in the future, but we will learn from working people."

    The students and Teacher Song who were sitting there laughed and praised Liu Meiyu repeatedly. Everyone also repeatedly expressed that they now love the carpentry labor practice class! Currently, everyone is making teaching instrument shelves and is determined and confident to learn and work more outstandingly in the carpentry labor practice class. They said that if the motherland allows them to do this work in the future, they will have no second thoughts and will be ready to become the first batch of female carpenters in New China at any time, serving socialist construction.

    六百多个年青的女木工
    ——记北京市女十四中学生在木工劳动中的收获
    本报记者　孙祖年
    在北京女十四中的教室里、图书室里、老师的办公室里，都可以看到一种引人入胜的小巧伶珑的木制小书架，火炬形的毛巾架子。当陌生人第一次看到这些物品的时候，总是要好奇地问：“这些别致的物品是从那里买来的？”而他们听到的回答总是：“这些物品，是我们初中一年级的学生们，在木工劳动实习课中，用她们的智慧和勤劳的双手创造出来的，说给你听，那话可就长啦！”
    为了把青年学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者，女十四中的老师们十分重视劳动教育，从前年9月1日开学以后，初中一年级的十二个班，增设了木工劳动实习课。
    开始，同学们对木工劳动实习课的目的和意义是认识不足的。许多人认为，在社会上做木匠的都是男人，还没有见过有女木匠哩！我们都是女孩子，难道毕业后都要去做木匠？那又多么不文明呀！要不是为了日后当木匠，那现在学习木工课又有什么益处呢？真是一门多余的课，它会妨碍其他课程的学习啊！
    大家抱着不同的心情去应付这门课程。但是，木工劳动是要用双手把一根一根的木材做出一种成品来，是应付不过去的啊！起初同学们硬着头皮，拿起刨子和锯非常发愁，因为刨子要掌握不好刨出来的面就不光不平，锯掌握不好就锯不直。有的时候，把手都磨出泡，累得满头大汗，也不能达到合乎标准的要求。徐淑芬同学使用刨子由于前力用的过猛，把木材刨的像鱼鳞一样一片一片翘起来，急得满头是汗，怎么也刨不平。王贵贤同学拿着生疏的工具——刨、锯、木锤，面对着木材发呆，不敢动手。就是动起手来费了九牛二虎之力，木材也搞的不成样子。她想：“要做成一件美丽的成品，那是多么难啊！”大家和徐、王同学的心情一样，对木工劳动实习课不感兴趣，也没有信心会想到在这门课程中真正学会木工。开头那几天，每个同学一上木工课，就期望着下课的铃声。
    对学生们的这些心情，教木工劳动实习课的宋老师，是非常清楚的。他面对着一群天真活泼的女学生怎办呢？他觉得自己的责任是，在木工劳动过程中，培养学生对劳动的兴趣和感情，逐步改变轻视木工劳动的思想。因此，每当学生们不耐烦时，宋老师总是从一件产品的设计、构图，一直到如何掌握和使用各种工具，进行操作的具体知识，谆谆诱导，讲给大家听，做给大家看，来启发同学们努力学习，热爱劳动。
    参加木工劳动实习课的同学，虽然学过算术中各种量度单位，但了解得很抽象，在实际中却不会运用。她们第一次给邮局做邮箱作业时，不太清楚一米是多少厘米或毫米、一米和一公尺的关系，结果大家把毫米当公分、把一公尺当一万毫米。按照这样的比例计算去设计图样，那么做出一个邮箱就要大出十倍，那就不是邮箱而成了装衣服的箱子了。在劳动中，大家按照老师使用工具的方法，了解到原来所以刨不平、锯不直，是用力过猛的缘故，从而逐步学会了把工具放稳，均衡地运用力量进行操作。这样既不费大力气，又能把一根木材刨平锯直。当大家学会使用工具，能做出一种材料，最后合成一件成品时，都深深地感到：木工劳动光凭蛮干可不行，这里面还有一种技术啊！经过这样的劳动实践，同学们才恍然大悟，原来上木工劳动实习课，不单纯是为了当木匠，而是为了联系实际，巩固已经学到的成果，培养对基本生产知识的了解和劳动技能的锻炼，为今后其他学科的学习进一步打下基础。从此，同学们对木工劳动课发生了很大的兴趣和浓厚的感情，再没有人说这是一门多余的课程了。每到上这一节课时，同学们都聚精会神地劳动着。当六百三十六个漆得发亮的邮箱，整齐地摆在操作台上时，每个人面对着自己的劳动成果，高兴得跳起来说：就是当个木匠，也是光荣的啊！
    一年多来，由同学们亲手做出来的还有木制小书架一百七十四个，火炬形毛巾架五十五个，板擦五十六个，育鱼苗箱二十四个，挂衣板二十八个，赛跑用的起跑板二十四个。这些用具和教具，对教学发挥了直接作用，为学校创造财富近一千元。
    六百多个初一学生，在木工劳动实习课中，都有很大的收获。在学生中出现了热爱劳动、热爱科学技术、爱护公共财物的新气象。女十四中过去在学期结束时，总以初一各班教室内的桌椅坏得最多，但上学期初一各班，由于学习了木工，体会到成品制作的艰难，知道加以爱护，结果在去年暑假检查时，桌椅坏的很少。如果要找一些学生，请她们谈谈木工劳动的收获，她会滔滔不绝给你讲出许多许多。
    有一天，我在吃过午饭的时候，碰到了王贵贤、刘美玉、徐淑芬、张淑荣四个学生。我问她们劳动有哪些收获？王贵贤想了一想后，就对我说：“就拿算术来说吧，过去学的比例尺、单位换算等，在木工劳动运用中，更加巩固了。还有，木工劳动为我们现在初二的植物、几何、物理学增加了实际知识，学起来就更容易理解啦！”这时，刘美玉突然接上来说：“过去我不了解木工劳动实习课，对其他学科的学习有这些好处，一到上这节课时就厌烦。我一向不爱劳动。有一次在家里，我的妹妹责备我，说我这么大的姑娘，是饭来张口，衣来伸手，做姐姐的应比妹妹多给父母做些家务事。我气愤地回答，不见得，谁给你规定的！自从参加了学校木工劳动课，看到每一件产品，都是同学们用双手创造出来的。这时，我才认识到对妹妹那种态度是不对的，感到不劳动是可耻的。从此，我改变了不爱劳动的习惯。在校积极参加体力劳动，就是放学回家，除了复习功课以外，我总是争取时间帮助做家务事。不久，爸爸还来学校向老师夸奖我哩！有一次，我弟弟的课外学习小组，在我家集体温习功课。有一个同学的姐夫是木匠，大家都在讽刺地笑他姐夫没出息，怎么当一个小木匠呀！我听了实在忍不住，就走过去理直气壮地说，做木匠有什么值得大家这样好笑呢？你们想一想，没有木匠，你们今天能很好地学习吗？课堂上会有桌子椅子吗？会有很好的校舍吗？我们祖国那一项大的建设工程，少得了木匠吗？我还举了学校木工劳动的许多例子。经我这样一说，小学生们连声地说，姐姐，姐姐，我们错了，向您保证，以后我们不再轻视劳动人民了，而要向劳动人民学习”。
    在坐的几位同学和宋老师都笑了，连连称赞刘美玉。大家还一再地表示，现在我们爱上了木工劳动实习课啦！目前大家正在做教学仪器架子，有决心有信心在木工劳动实习课中，学习、劳动得更出色。她们说，如果祖国将来让她们干这工作，绝没有二话，随时准备着做新中国第一批女木匠，为社会主义建设服务。
