    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 3rd: Bonn dispatch: West German government spokesman Felix Eckardt said at a press conference held in Bonn today that the West German government is "carefully studying" the proposal made by Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki regarding the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. However, he also said that he could not yet say whether a positive or negative conclusion would be reached.
    Observers in Bonn generally believe that the West German government's attitude towards the Polish proposal has changed from "outright rejection" to "careful study" within half a month due to increasing pressure from public opinion at home and abroad. Not only do increasingly broad sections of society and the opposition parties unanimously agree with the Polish proposal, but even the bourgeois newspapers that often support the government's foreign policy advocate holding negotiations on the Polish proposal.

    西德官方在舆论的压力下改变腔调
    表示正在仔细研究波兰倡议
    据新华社柏林3日电　波恩消息：西德政府发言人费利克斯·埃卡特今天在波恩举行的记者招待会上说，西德政府正在“仔细地研究”波兰外长拉帕茨基所提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议。但是他又说，目前他还不能说将得出肯定的还是否定的结论。
    波恩的观察家们普遍地认为，西德政府对波兰建议的态度在半个月内从“断然拒绝”转变到“仔细研究”是由于它受到了国内外舆论的越来越大的压力。不但越来越广泛的社会各阶层人士和反对党一致赞同波兰的建议，就是经常支持政府外交政策的资产阶级报纸也主张就波兰的建议举行谈判。
