Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: A massive mass-based Spring Festival literary and artistic promotion campaign is about to unfold in rural areas across the country.

Currently, fifteen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, including Liaoning, Anhui, Guangdong, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia, have made specific arrangements for the Spring Festival literary and artistic promotion activities. "Every commune has activities, everyone receives education, celebrate the Spring Festival joyfully, and vigorously engage in production." This is the slogan put forward by many provinces. Shanxi Province requires that literary and artistic activities be carried out throughout the province, regardless of plains, mountains, large villages, or small villages, so that men, women, old, and young can participate. Jiangsu Province requires that in general areas, every county should have performances, every township should have operas to watch, every commune should have activities, and every team should have songs to sing.

This year's Spring Festival literary and artistic promotion activities are closely integrated with the current central tasks and the high tide of great production in rural areas. The great debate between the two lines of socialism and capitalism, the victory of the First Five-Year Plan, striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year, and the East Wind prevailing over the West internationally are all themes for rural amateur literary and art enthusiasts and folk artists. They compose songs and write plays to praise the great leap forward in socialist construction and their new life. The two central clubs in Huanggang County, Hubei, have arranged the "Canal Construction" drama to praise the heroic labor of the peasants. A large number of cadres sent to lower levels also actively participate in amateur cultural and artistic activities. This year's Spring Festival literary and artistic promotion activities will take many forms, and various places are promoting some new activity methods and traditional folk art forms that are popular among the masses. Shanxi Province plans to establish the "Patriotic Day" and "Love-the-Commune Day" systems in suitable places through Spring Festival literary and artistic activities. All localities also pay attention to running literary and artistic activities frugally and oppose waste.

Provinces and cities are organizing art performance groups, film projection teams, and mobile book supply teams to go to the countryside and mountains during the Spring Festival, and have prepared a large number of singing materials for rural Spring Festival literary and artistic promotion activities. Before and after the Spring Festival, Liaoning Province will have 70 various art performance groups and more than 230 film projection teams go deep into rural areas, mountainous areas, and coastal islands for activities. In addition to performing in the countryside, these art performance groups will also guide rural amateur literary and artistic activities.

All localities plan to consolidate and vigorously develop rural clubs, train backbone members of amateur literary and artistic activities, and promote the gradual regularization of rural amateur literary and artistic activities and amateur literary and artistic creation activities through Spring Festival literary and artistic activities. Shaanxi Province has decided to vigorously develop rural clubs in places where rural clubs have not been established, especially in mountainous areas, to encourage the enthusiasm of the people in the mountains.

    快快乐乐过春节　轰轰烈烈搞生产
    今年春节农村文娱活动将更加热闹
    据新华社30日讯　一个规模巨大的群众性春节文艺宣传活动就要在各地农村展开。
    目前辽宁、安徽、广东、云南、陕西、江苏、四川、山西、内蒙古等十五个省、自治区、市已经就春节文艺宣传活动作了具体布置。“社社有活动，人人受教育，热热闹闹过春节，轰轰烈烈搞生产。”这是不少省提出的口号。山西省要求在全省范围内，无论平川、山地、大庄、小村都开展文艺活动，作到男女老少都参加。江苏省要求在一般地区做到县县有会演、乡乡有戏看、社社有活动、队队有歌声。
    今年的春节文艺宣传活动是密切结合各地农村当前的中心任务和大生产高潮进行的。社会主义和资本主义两条路线大辩论、第一个五年计划的胜利、争取今年农业生产大跃进和国际上的东风压倒西风等，都是农村业余文艺爱好者和民间艺人们的创作主题，他们作歌、编剧来歌颂社会主义事业的大跃进和自己的新生活。湖北黄冈县两个中心俱乐部编排了“修渠”剧，来歌颂农民的英雄劳动。大批下放干部也积极参加业余文化艺术活动。今年春节文艺宣传活动的形式将很多样，各地都在推广一些受到群众喜爱的新的活动方法和传统的民间文艺活动形式。山西省准备通过春节文艺活动，在有条件的地方将“爱国日”和“爱社日”的制度建立起来。各地还注意勤俭搞文艺活动，反对浪费。
    各省市正在组织文艺表演团体和电影放映队、流动图书供应队等在春节期间下乡上山，并为农村春节文艺宣传活动准备了大批演唱材料。辽宁省春节前后将有七十个各类艺术表演团体和二百三十多个电影放映队深入农村、山区和沿海岛屿活动。这些艺术表演团体除下乡演出外，还将辅导农村业余文艺活动。
    各地都计划通过春节文艺活动，巩固并大力发展农村俱乐部，训练业余文艺活动的骨干分子，以推动农村业余文艺活动和业余文艺创作活动逐步走向经常化。陕西省决定在没有建立农村俱乐部的地方，特别是山区，大力发展农村俱乐部，来鼓舞山区人民的干劲。
