The musical comedy "Carnival" is an extremely moving film. It tells the story of how young people at a cultural palace are enthusiastically preparing for the New Year's Eve party. However, the acting director of the cultural palace, Aoguerzhuofu, is picking and choosing, finding fault everywhere, because he is determined to put on a "serious" party. The young people appear to comply with him on the surface, but secretly they are trying to deal with him. As a result, at the New Year's Eve party, performances are staged that are completely contrary to the director's expectations, which are brilliant and humorous, making the director furious...

The film's content is novel and colorful, including not only songs, dances, magic, and acrobatics, but also vivid and lively characters, such as the bureaucratic Aoguerzhuofu and the energetic young girl Lena. The film's form of expression is also very clever: the film does not directly point out that Aoguerzhuofu is a bureaucrat, nor does it make any direct condemnation of him; however, no matter what role he appears in, he unconsciously becomes a clown in the ongoing program, a target of ridicule.

Aoguerzhuofu was supposed to convey the instructions from above in this way, letting comrades "welcome the New Year happily." But because he has endless worries in his heart, concerned that the young amateur actors are not steady, feeling that every program is suspicious, he has to put on a gloomy face to review each program. Here, the conflict unfolds. And each round leaves Aoguerzhuofu crestfallen due to failure.

Aoguerzhuofu himself drafted the party program: he himself would deliver the opening speech, then invite a speaker to give a forty-minute report on whether there is life on Mars, and then... But no one expected such a wonderful scene to appear before the audience: when Aoguerzhuofu went on stage to speak, what he took out of his pocket was not his speech, but a goose; he frantically groped around, but then took out endless colorful paper strips from his pocket. It turned out that the magician had replaced his speech with his magic box! Here, the artist brilliantly integrated the performance of the program and the depiction of the character Aoguerzhuofu, arousing people's laughter.

Does Aoguerzhuofu not need joy, not like interesting things? No, he likes them too. He just wants to pretend to be so solemn. This is fully revealed when he reviews the clown's comical performance. The actor Iljinsky, who plays Aoguerzhuofu, gave a very excellent performance in this scene. A red bow tie with a rubber band on the clown's neck aroused Aoguerzhuofu's interest. He curiously pulled it two or three times, a hint of a smile squeezing out on his face, as if saying, "This thing is not bad!" But he immediately felt that this was wrong, so he immediately put on a stern face and taught the actor: "Is this what a Soviet person is like?" And he asked the clown to "appear before the audience in his true colors." This forced the actor playing the clown to make a self-criticism.

This scene, on the surface, seems to be a victory for Aoguerzhuofu, but in reality, he failed. Because this not only exposed his backwardness and stubbornness, but also revealed something deep in his heart, making people realize that he also likes interesting things, but the taste is not high!

"Carnival" powerfully ridicules those who are indifferent to new things and timid. It not only brings us laughter with its comedy plot but also burns away some of the outdated ideas in our minds.

    音乐喜剧片“狂欢”
    呼延熺
    “狂欢”是一部极其动人的音乐喜剧片。它叙述了这样一个故事：文化宫里许多青年正兴高采烈地在准备新年晚会节目；但是文化宫代理主任敖古尔卓夫却在那里挑三挑四，处处感到不称心，因为他一意要搞一个“严肃”的晚会。青年们表面上顺着他，背地里却想法对付他。结果在新年晚会上，演出了与主任的预计完全相反的精彩而又幽默的节目，使得主任暴跳如雷……
    影片内容新颖多彩，其中不但有歌，有舞，有魔术，有杂技，而且也有鲜明、生动的人物形象，譬如官僚主义者敖古尔卓夫，生气勃勃的年青姑娘列娜等；影片的表现形式也非常巧妙：片中没有直接指明敖古尔卓夫是个官僚主义者，也没有对他作任何正面的谴责；然而不论他以什么身份出现，他都不自觉地成为正在进行的节目中的一个丑角，成为人们讽刺的对象。
    敖古尔卓夫本来应该这样传达上级的指示，让同志们“快快活活地迎接新年”。但是由于他内心有着无限的忧虑，耽心年青的业余演员们不稳重，觉得每个节目都有可疑之处，于是他不得不摆起一副阴沉的面孔来审查每个节目。在这里，矛盾展开了。而每一个回合，都使敖古尔卓夫因失败而垂头丧气。
    敖古尔卓夫自己拟定了晚会程序：由他自己致开会词，然后请报告员作四十分钟的关于火星上是否有生物的报告，然后……但是谁也没有想到出现在观众面前的是如此奇妙的景象：敖古尔卓夫上台讲话时，从怀里掏出来的不是讲演稿，而是一只鹅；他慌慌张张地浑身乱摸，但接着从口袋里掏出的却又是抽不完的五颜六色的纸条。原来魔术师用自己的魔术箱换去了他的讲演稿！在这里，艺术家非常出色地把节目的演出和对敖古尔卓夫这一人物的描叙有机地揉合起来，逗起了人们的笑。
    难道敖古尔卓夫不需要欢乐，不喜欢有趣的事物吗？不，他也是喜欢的。他不过是要把自己硬装得那样道貌岸然罢了。这从他审查那个小丑的滑稽表演时便充分地表露了出来。饰演敖古尔卓夫的演员伊林斯基在这场戏里作了非常出色的表演。小丑脖子上的一个带有橡皮筋的红球领结，引起了敖古尔卓夫的兴趣，他好奇地扯了两三下，脸上挤出了一丝笑，似乎在说：“这玩意儿倒不错！”但他马上觉得这是不对的，于是立刻板起面孔来教训演员：“苏维埃人是这样的吗？”并且要小丑“以本来面目出现在观众面前”。使演小丑的演员不得不作自我检讨。
    这场戏，在表面上看，似乎是敖古尔卓夫胜利了，但实际上他却失败了。因为这不仅暴露了他的落后和顽固，同时也流露了他内心深处的东西，使人们觉察到，原来他也是喜欢有趣的东西的，然而格调却并不高！
    “狂欢”有力地嘲笑了那些对新事物冷淡的、畏缩不前的人。它不但以它的喜剧情节带给我们欢笑，也烧掉我们心头的一些陈旧的意识。
