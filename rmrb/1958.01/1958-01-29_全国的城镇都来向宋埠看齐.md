Let All Towns in the Country Learn from Songbu

Under the current situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production, how towns support the countryside and how urban and rural areas promote each other is a very important issue. In this regard, Songbu Town in Macheng County, Hubei Province, has set an example.

Songbu is a small town with only more than 8,000 residents. In the past year, it has exceptionally supported agricultural production. Almost everyone in the town has contributed to supporting agricultural production. Handicraft workers took their furnaces to the countryside, lived there, and repaired and manufactured farm tools for farmers. Technicians organized themselves to improve and trial-produce dozens of new farm tools; when agricultural cooperative members didn't know how to use double-wheeled double-shared plows, they went to the countryside to experiment and teach the techniques. When the water tank of the agricultural cooperative's water pump froze and broke, the workers at the bus station's maintenance shop immediately helped repair it, coming whenever called and teaching while repairing. Commercial workers went to the countryside, not only delivering goods to the door but also to the fields, digging pond mud with the farmers. Barbers also carried their tools to the countryside, setting up small thatched sheds in the fields to cut hair for farmers. As for helping farmers with emergency harvesting and planting, fighting drought to protect seedlings, and accumulating and delivering fertilizer, it was almost a mobilization of the entire population, with everyone pitching in. During the drought resistance and seedling protection last year, more than 4,000 people were mobilized at one time, accounting for half of the town's population. They spent a day and two nights building a large reservoir dam, guaranteeing a bumper harvest on 20,000 mu of land. In January of this year, more than 4,000 people were mobilized again, delivering more than 7,000 dan of fertilizer to the countryside at one time. This kind of drive, this kind of atmosphere, and this kind of practice in Songbu Town deserves to be greatly promoted and popularized in all towns across the country.

A small town like Songbu can do so much to support agricultural production and achieve such good results. There are countless towns like this across the country. It is clear that the potential of towns to support agricultural production is very great. However, potential is latent power. If you cannot see it and do not explore it, you cannot turn it into actual power. All those who do not see this potential or underestimate it should learn from the example of Songbu. Before 1957, the Party organization in Songbu also did not see this potential and did not have a clear idea of supporting agricultural production. At that time, Songbu and the surrounding villages were disconnected. "Cadres wandering the streets, not caring about production" was a local rhyme that expressed the farmers' dissatisfaction with this disconnection. In 1957, the thinking of the Party organization here caught up with the situation. They put forward the fighting slogan: "Mobilize all forces, try every means, overcome all difficulties, support agricultural production, everything for a great agricultural harvest," boosting morale, and the situation completely changed. Now, many places across the country are beginning to reverse the disconnection between towns and the countryside. Many towns in Jiangsu Province have launched revolutionary competitions to support agricultural production. The town work conference in Jiangyin County made a more comprehensive plan for the current work, setting off a surge of comparing resolutions, comparing enthusiasm, comparing creativity, and comparing contributions. If all towns across the country do this, if everyone living in the towns—including cadres, workers, handicraft workers, commercial, banking, cultural, educational, and health workers, as well as all residents—rallies their energy and contributes to the great leap forward in agricultural production, then it can be predicted that the methods people create and the power they unleash will be infinite.

Promoting the countryside, in turn, promotes the city; supporting agriculture, in turn, promotes industry, commerce, and all other sectors. This relationship of mutual support and mutual promotion between urban and rural areas is a new type of socialist urban-rural relationship. This relationship embodies our country's fundamental policy of the worker-peasant alliance, and it also embodies the principle of mutual promotion and mutual support between industry and agriculture. After the people gained power, especially after the basic completion of the three major transformations, the relationship between towns and villages, of course, is no longer the relationship of exploitation and being exploited in the old China, and there is no fundamental opposition. Our towns and villages have consistent fundamental interests. However, this does not mean that there are no contradictions between urban and rural areas. Rural areas have been cooperativized, and agricultural production has greatly developed, which has greatly increased the demands on towns. This is a contradiction in the current new situation. Correctly understanding this situation, correctly handling this contradiction, and catching up with all the work in the towns will not only support the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also the work in the towns will follow the great leap forward. Here, we would also like to talk about the example of Songbu. Because Songbu Town's handicraft cooperative vigorously supported agriculture, this year's total output value will increase by 43.4% compared to 1957. Isn't this a leap forward? In order to transport large amounts of fertilizer to the countryside, the town cleaned up many ditches and built many toilets in 1957, eliminating more than 50,000 rats. Now the town's patriotic health work is done very well. Isn't this also a leap forward? In 1956, the town had to pay 600 to 800 yuan in relief funds to needy households every month. In 1957, the town organized these needy households to engage in production such as raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and growing vegetables. This year, the government does not need to pay relief funds anymore. Isn't this also a leap forward? These three examples illustrate the general situation. This new type of socialist relationship of mutual promotion between urban and rural areas is vividly reflected in Songbu Town. However, not everyone understands this principle of urban-rural relations. Some people still hold the view that urban and rural areas are "unrelated," thinking that rural affairs are "nothing to do with oneself"; others handle urban-rural relations with a departmentalist attitude, doing what is beneficial to themselves and not doing what is not beneficial to themselves, shirking responsibility when something happens. As a result, it is not beneficial to the countryside, not beneficial to the towns, and not beneficial to oneself. It is not promoting, but retarding. Therefore, in the current work of launching towns to support the countryside, it is very necessary to conduct a debate, allowing all cadres and all people to recognize the new type of relationship between urban and rural areas, recognize the relationship between agricultural production and all work in the towns, and correct various erroneous views and practices.

We hope that all towns across the country will learn from Songbu and launch a revolutionary competition in supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production.

### 全国的城镇都来向宋埠看齐

    全国的城镇都来向宋埠看齐
    在目前农业生产大跃进的形势下，城镇如何支援农村，城乡如何互相促进，是一个十分值得重视的问题。在这方面，湖北省麻城县的宋埠镇已经作出了榜样。
    宋埠，是一个只有八千多居民的小镇。在过去的一年中，它异常出色地支援了农业生产。差不多全镇每一个人，都为支援农业生产出了力。手工业工人把红炉带下了乡，住在乡里，为农民修理和制造农具。技术工人组织起来了，改良和试制了几十种新农具；农业社员不会使用双轮双铧犁，他们就下乡试验，传授技术。农业社抽水机的水箱冻坏了，汽车站保养场的工人就马上帮助修理，随唤随到，随修随教。商业工作人员下乡，不仅把货送上门，而且把货送到田边，跟着农民一起挖塘泥。理发工人也把用具挑下乡，在田边搭起了小草棚，为农民理发。至于帮助农民抢收抢种、抗旱保苗、积肥送肥，几乎做到了全民动员、人人动手。去年抗旱保苗时，一次就出动了四千多人，占全镇人口的一半，他们用了一天两夜的时间，修起了一条蓄水大坝，保证了二万亩地的丰收。今年1月又出动了四千多人，一次送了七千多担肥料下乡。宋埠镇的这种干劲，这种风气，这种做法，值得在全国的一切城镇大大提倡和推广。
    像宋埠这样的一个小镇，就能够为支援农业生产做出这么多的事情，获得这么好的成绩，全国这样的城镇，何止成千上万。可见，城镇支援农业生产的潜力是非常大的。但是，潜力者，潜在的力量也。如果你看不见它，不去发掘它，就不能把它变为实际的力量。所有看不到这种潜力，或者对它估计不足的人，应该从宋埠的例子中得到教训。1957年以前，宋埠的党组织也没有看到这种潜力，没有明确支援农业生产的思想。那时候，宋埠和它周围的乡村是脱节的。“干部满街转，生产他不管”，这是当地农民编的顺口溜，表达了他们对这种脱节的不满。1957年，这里的党组织的思想才跟上了形势，他们提出了战斗的口号：“动员一切力量，想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，支援农业生产，一切为了农业生产大丰收”，鼓起了干劲，局面就完全改观了。现在，全国许多地方都正在着手扭转城镇和乡村脱节的局面。江苏省的许多城镇已经开展了支援农业生产的革命竞赛。江阴县的城镇工作会议把目前各项工作作了一个比较全面的规划，掀起了比决心、比干劲、比创造、比贡献的热潮。如果全国所有的城镇都来这样做，如果每个住在城镇的人——包括干部，工人，手工业者，商业、银行、文教、卫生工作者以及所有的居民，都鼓足干劲，为农业生产大跃进做出贡献，那末，可以预计，人们创造出来的办法和发挥出来的力量，将是无穷无尽的。
    促进了农村，反过来也就促进了城市；支援了农业，反过来也就促进了工业、商业和其它各行各业。这种城乡互相支援、互相促进的关系，就是社会主义的新型的城乡关系。这种关系，体现了我国工农联盟的根本政策，也体现了工业和农业互相促进、互相支援的方针。人民取得政权之后，特别是三大改造基本完成之后，城镇和乡村的关系，当然不再是旧中国时代的那种剥削同被剥削的关系，不再存在什么根本性的对立了。我国的城镇和乡村，在根本利益上是一致的。但是，这并不是说在城乡之间已经没有任何矛盾。城乡之间还是有各种各样的矛盾的。农村合作化了，农业生产大大发展了，对城镇的要求也就大大增加了，这就是在目前新形势下的一个矛盾。正确地认识这种形势，正确地处理这个矛盾，把城镇的各项工作都赶上去，就不仅能支援农业生产大跃进，而且城镇的工作也会跟着大跃进。在这里，我们还要谈一下宋埠的例子。宋埠镇的手工业合作社由于大力支援农业，今年的生产总值将比1957年提高43.4％，这不是一个跃进吗？为了向农村输送大量肥料，这个镇在1957年就清理了很多阴沟，修建了很多厕所，消灭了五万多只老鼠；现在这个镇的爱国卫生工作做得很好，这不也是一个跃进吗？1956年，全镇要给困难户每月发救济费六百到八百元，1957年，镇里组织这些困难户从事养猪积肥和种菜等生产，今年就不用政府再发救济费了，这不也是一个跃进吗？举此三例，即可说明一般。城乡互相促进的这种社会主义的新型的关系，在宋埠镇得到了生动的体现。可是，城乡关系的这个道理，并不是所有的人都懂得了。有人还抱着城乡“无关”论，以为乡村的事情，“与己无关”；有人则以本位主义的态度来处理城乡关系，对己有利的就干，对己没利的就不干，遇事推诿，结果是，对乡村不利，对城镇不利，对己也不利，不是促进，而是促退了。因此，在目前开展城镇支援农村的工作中，就这个问题进行一次鸣放辩论，使全体干部和全体人民都认清城乡之间的新型关系，认清农业生产和城镇一切工作的关系，纠正各种错误的看法和做法，很有必要。
    我们希望全国的城镇都来向宋埠看齐，在支援农业生产大跃进方面，也来一个革命大竞赛。
