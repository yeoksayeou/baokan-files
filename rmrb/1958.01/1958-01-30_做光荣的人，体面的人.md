    Be a Glorious Person, a Decent Person
    Wang Pu
    In the thousands upon thousands of tasks involved in building socialism, are there distinctions between noble and base, decent and indecent? This question is debated not only among intellectuals but also among the working masses. The news report "This is Also Labor for Building Socialism" published in today's newspaper reflects this debate: some people believe that Liu Zhencai's work as a general service worker is indecent.
    In feudal society, there was a distinction between nobles and commoners; in bourgeois society, there was also a distinction between high society and the lower class. Feudal aristocrats, the bourgeoisie, and the officials who served them, large and small, all called the work of exploiting and oppressing the people noble or decent, and all physical labor base or indecent. Dividing social occupations into noble and base, decent and indecent, is linked to class exploitation and class oppression, and is inseparable from the exploiting classes' contempt for working people. At that time, when people said they wanted to find a noble or decent job, it meant they wanted to stand on the heads of the working people and climb into the camp of the exploiting classes.
    Now, in our country, the feudal landlord and capitalist exploitation systems have been basically eliminated, and the exploiting classes are on the path to being eliminated. Six hundred million people are equal before the law. We also have a social division of labor, with distinctions between physical and mental labor, between leaders and the led, and between engaging in this kind of physical labor and that kind of physical labor, and so on. But these are just differences in work posts; there is no such thing as noble and base, decent and indecent. Whether you are teaching in a school, working in an office, operating a machine in a factory, farming in the countryside, or fetching water and sweeping the floor, all are indispensable jobs for building socialism. All labor is glorious, noble, and decent.
    Of course, in our country, there are also distinctions between glorious and disgraceful, decent and indecent. However, these distinctions are not determined by people's work posts but by their attitude towards labor. No matter what work post you are in, as long as you have high awareness, a good work attitude, great work achievements, and make significant contributions to the country, you will be respected by the people, valued by the Party and the government, and you will be the most glorious person, the most decent person. If you do not work hard, or if you are picky and choose only the easy tasks, harming the interests of the country for personal gain, you will be despised by society, criticized by the masses and superiors, and you will be the most disgraceful person, the most indecent person. Liu Zhencai, who does general service work, has been repeatedly named an advanced producer; while some people, although doing work they consider "superior," have never been named advanced producers. The reason lies in this.
    Currently, some people call relatively easy or lucrative jobs noble and decent, while calling relatively tiring or low-paying jobs base and indecent. They are picky about what they do, and if they cannot find a suitable job, they become emotional and dawdle. This is mainly because these people are looking at new social issues with old eyes, which means they have bourgeois individualism in their minds. This kind of thinking hinders both individual progress and the development of production. All those who love socialism should take advantage of this rectification movement to examine themselves thoroughly, dig out this bad thing, and eradicate it completely.

    做光荣的人，体面的人
    王朴
    在建设社会主义的千千万万种工作中，有没有高贵和卑贱、体面和不体面的区分？对这个问题，不仅在知识分子中有争论，而且在工人群众中也有争论。今天本报发表的“这也是建设社会主义的劳动”的通讯中就反映了这种争论：有人认为刘振才做勤杂工作是不体面的。
    在封建社会里，有贵族和平民的区分；在资产阶级社会里，也有上流社会和下层社会的区分。封建贵族、资产阶级和为他们服务的大大小小的官儿，都把从事剥削和压迫人民的工作，叫做高贵的或体面的工作，把一切体力劳动都叫做卑贱的或不体面的工作。把社会职业分为高贵与卑贱、体面与不体面，是跟阶级剥削、阶级压迫相联系着的，是跟剥削阶级鄙视劳动人民分不开的。在那时候，人们说要找一个高贵的或体面的工作，这就意味着他要站在劳动人民的头上，往剥削阶级的营垒里爬。
    现在，在我们国家里，封建地主和资本主义的剥削制度已经基本消灭，剥削阶级正处在消灭的途中，六亿人民在法律面前是平等的。我们也有社会分工，有从事体力劳动和脑力劳动的区别，有领导和被领导的区别，有从事这种体力劳动和那种体力劳动的区别等等。但这只是工作岗位的区别，并不存在所谓高贵和卑贱、体面和不体面的问题。在学校教书的也好，在机关里工作的也好，在工厂里开机器的也好，在农村里种田的也好，打水扫地的也好，都是建设社会主义所不可缺少的工作。一切劳动都是光荣的，都是高贵的和体面的。
    当然，在我们国家里，人也有光荣和不光荣、体面和不体面的区别。只是这种区别不是根据人们的工作岗位来决定，而是根据人们对待劳动的态度来决定的。不论你在什么工作岗位上，只要觉悟高，劳动态度好，工作成绩大，对国家贡献多，就受到人们的尊敬，受到党和政府的器重，你就是最光荣的人，最体面的人。如果你不好好地劳动，或者挑肥拣瘦，为了个人利益损害国家利益，你就会受到社会的鄙视，受到群众和上级的批评，你就是最不光荣的人，最不体面的人。刘振才做勤杂工作，连续被评为先进生产者；而有些人虽然做的是自以为“高人一等”的工作，却从来也没有被评为先进生产者，其道理就在此。
    现在，有些人把比较轻松的或者能挣大钱的工作叫做高贵的、体面的工作，把比较劳累的或者挣钱较少的工作叫做卑贱的、不体面的工作，做起事来挑挑拣拣，挑不到适合的就闹情绪、泡蘑菇。主要是因为这些人用旧眼光来看新社会的事情，也就是脑子里有着资产阶级个人主义思想。这种思想既妨碍个人的进步，也阻碍生产的发展。一切热爱社会主义的人，应当利用这次整风的机会，好好检查一下，把这个坏东西搜出来，连根拔掉。
