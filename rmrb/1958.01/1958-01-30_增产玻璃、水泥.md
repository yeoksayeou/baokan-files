Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: This reporter learned from the Ministry of Building Materials Industry that, according to preliminary plans, the national annual cement production this year will reach 7.65 million tons, an increase of 12% compared to last year.

The Ministry of Building Materials Industry tentatively plans to produce 47.9 million square meters of flat glass this year, an increase of about 4% compared to last year.

New cement products put into production this year include dam cement, plugging cement, and quick-hardening cement. Cement products being trial-produced include high-grade cement, silicate expansive cement, and silicate cement with a high magnesium oxide content.

New building material products to be trial-produced this year also include glass fiber and products to replace industrial insulation gauze, glass pipes for construction needed by the food and chemical petroleum industries, asbestos cement pipes for oil and gas pipelines, and reinforced concrete pressure pipes for water supply.

Key construction projects include the continued construction of three large cement plants in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Henan. A cement plant will begin construction in Guizhou this year. Zhejiang and Anhui provinces will begin construction of two small cement plants this year.

In the Central China region, Henan and Hunan provinces will begin new construction and continue existing construction of two glass factories this year.
