Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 4th: Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today saying that the Japanese government's attempt to forcibly repatriate Korean residents detained in Japan to South Korea in exchange for Japanese fishermen detained in South Korea is an unacceptable and inhumane act.

Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement was issued in response to the "Joint Statement" issued by the Japanese government and the South Korean authorities on December 31, 1957. In their "Joint Statement," the Japanese government and the South Korean authorities decided to forcibly repatriate more than 1,200 Korean residents detained in the Omura and Hamamatsu detention centers in Japan to South Korea and "exchange" them with Japanese fishermen detained in South Korea. At the same time, they decided to resume comprehensive negotiations between the Japanese government and the South Korean authorities.

Foreign Minister Nam Il said in the statement that the government of the Republic has repeatedly emphasized to the Japanese government that Korean residents detained in Japan must not be used for improper political purposes. However, the Japanese government, disregarding the claims of the Republic government, disregarding the ardent desire of the majority of Korean residents detained in Japan to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and violating humanitarianism, has decided to forcibly repatriate these Korean residents to South Korea.

The statement said that if the Japanese government disregards the legitimate demands of the Republic government and forcibly repatriates Korean residents detained in Japan to South Korea, or unilaterally resolves issues related to the interests of the entire Korean people with the South Korean authorities, then the Japanese government will bear full responsibility for the consequences.

    南日外务相发表声明
    斥日本同南朝鲜做人口买卖
    反对日政府把朝鲜侨民强送到南朝鲜
    新华社平壤4日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天发表声明说，日本政府企图把被扣留在日本的朝鲜侨民强迫遣送到南朝鲜以交换被扣留在南朝鲜的日本渔民的措施，是不能容许的不人道的行为。
    南日外务相的这项声明是就日本政府和南朝鲜当局在1957年12月31日发表的“联合声明”而发表的。日本政府和南朝鲜当局在它们的“联合声明”中，决定把被扣留在日本的大村收容所和滨松收容所的一千二百多名朝鲜侨民强迫遣送到南朝鲜，并且同被扣留在南朝鲜的日本渔民“交换”。同时，他们决定恢复日本政府和南朝鲜当局之间的全面谈判。
    南日外务相在声明中说，共和国政府曾经多次向日本政府强调，不得把被扣留在日本的朝鲜侨民用于不正当的政治目的。但是，日本政府不顾共和国政府的主张，不顾被扣留在日本的大部分朝鲜侨民热烈希望回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的愿望，违反人道主义而决定把这些朝鲜侨民强迫遣送到南朝鲜。
    声明说，日本政府如果不顾共和国政府的正当要求，把被扣留在日本的朝鲜侨民向南朝鲜强迫遣送，或者同南朝鲜当局片面解决有关全朝鲜人民的利益的问题，那么，日本政府将对其后果负完全责任。
