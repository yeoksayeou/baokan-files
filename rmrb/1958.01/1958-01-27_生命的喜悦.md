　　I stepped on the small path I ran along as a child, and when I saw the hills and fields I was familiar with, I fell into childhood memories, and a kind of uncontrollable excitement and joy made my whole mood tense. I remembered many people, those who herded cattle with me on the hillsides as children, those who caught fish with me in the river, or those friends who had argued and fought with me, and who had gone to school with me. I also remembered the older generation of uncles and aunts, especially Aunt Zhang. Aunt Zhang's fate was bumpy. The bleak, sorrowful, and impoverished dark life she lived in the old society made her linger in emptiness and illusion, pinning her hopes on the afterlife; it made her young life like a withered flower, a faded ribbon. She became a widow very young, and she often sighed that living was suffering; but no matter how hard it was, she relied on her maiden family to finally raise her daughter. When her daughter got married, she went to her daughter's place to live, relying on her daughter to make a living. Her son-in-law was also a farmer, and life was not good, and she herself felt very uncomfortable. But besides this, what other choice did she have?

　　Running into the village, my eyes fell on the place where Aunt Zhang had lived. That dilapidated house was gone. The old site of the house was taken by people to open up as a vegetable garden. Before I could even think about how Aunt Zhang was doing, many people ran towards me.

　　I planned to inquire whether Aunt Zhang was dead. If Aunt Zhang was still alive, she would definitely come to see me. Now that she hasn't come, I guess she is no longer in this world. Therefore, I didn't mention Aunt Zhang.

　　In the evening, I went outside to chat with the villagers and returned late at night. Just as I closed the door, preparing to rest, suddenly an old woman with completely white hair quietly pushed the door open and came in. I was stunned for a moment. What? Aunt Zhang is still alive?

　　Perhaps she saw me staring at her in astonishment, so she said kindly to me: "Do you still recognize me?" Before she let me answer, she continued: "I said long ago that you would come back. You drank the water from this well in our village, and you will definitely come back."

　　I asked her to sit down and carefully looked at her. She was very old, with a face full of wrinkles, and many teeth had fallen out. However, it seemed that her body was still fine. I asked her if she was doing well. She smiled and said: "Is there any need to ask? Your Aunt Zhang has lived to this day, do you still worry about starving to death?" Then, she happily told me that after liberation, she returned from her daughter's place, was allocated land, and allocated a watchtower. When the village established an agricultural cooperative, she was in the cooperative, sometimes herding cattle, sometimes taking care of children for the child-care group. Relying solely on her own labor, she could still maintain her own life. After the transition to the advanced cooperative, she was rated as a "Five-Guarantee Household," and life became even more prosperous.

　　I saw that she was in a very cheerful mood, as if she had something to say to me, but she couldn't say it. I was about to ask her, but she said that I was tired from the journey and should rest early, and declined and left. I was very excited and didn't want to sleep. I sat under the kerosene lamp, staring intently and thinking: Although she is old, her life has not withered, nor has it faded.

　　The next day, I found some time to go and see her, to see what she had to say to me. I ran to the entrance of the watchtower and saw an old man with a large frame inside. His head was already bald, and his beard was snow-white. He looked like a northerner. I didn't recognize this person. I was strange. Why is there an old man in Aunt Zhang's house?

　　Aunt Zhang was not at home, so the old man and I chatted.

　　This old man is also a "Five-Guarantee Household" with no relatives and no one to rely on. The people in the township believe that both he and Aunt Zhang are of good character. If they could live together and take care of each other, it would be good for them personally, and also good for the cooperative. So, they asked for their opinions. After consideration, they both agreed. People moved the old man into this watchtower. The old man stepped over the threshold of this watchtower and became younger. They lived together and lived well. A strong feeling of warm family made their spirit and life more closely integrated with the new society.

　　I sat for a while, but Aunt Zhang hadn't returned yet, so I left, but still looked back constantly with infinitely nostalgic eyes.

　　In the afternoon, I had to catch the last bus to leave. Aunt Zhang came to see me off. She apologized and said:

　　"You went to see me, but I wasn't at home, making you run for nothing."

　　"I didn't run for nothing. Although I didn't see you, I saw... your life is very good."

　　She and the others saw me off out of the village. The people went back, but she didn't go back; she saw me off to the bridgehead of the big bridge. I urged her to go back, but she still refused to go back. When we reached the mountainside, the road at the mountainside was relatively rugged, so I deliberately sat down, so she could go home. When she saw me sit down, she looked a little flustered, and a little embarrassed. I could see that she, like last night when she went to see me, had something to say in her heart, but she didn't want to say it, so I asked her. She pondered for a while before saying: "Nephew, I heard that there are some medicines for immortality? Is that true?"

　　I couldn't figure out for a moment why she brought up this question out of nowhere. I haven't heard of any medicines for immortality except in ancient mythology. So, I told her the truth:

　　"I haven't heard of such a medicine."

　　She was stunned, as if she realized she had said the wrong thing, or as if she suspected that I didn't respect the elderly. I hurriedly added:

　　"Maybe there will be in the future. If there is, I will ask someone to bring some back."

　　She smiled. But she said in a self-blaming tone: "Alas, in two more years I will be seventy, and I still don't want to die!"

    生命的喜悦
    马荫隐
    我踏着儿时跑过的小路，见到自己所熟识的山岗和田垅，自己就跌落在童年的回忆中，一种难以抑制的兴奋和欢乐，使我整个心情紧张起来。我记起很多人，记起那些在儿时和我一起到山坡上放过牛的，到河里去捉过鱼的，或者，和我吵过嘴、打过架，而又和我一起上过学的朋友。也记起前一辈的叔伯婶姆，特别是长婶，长婶的命运是颠簸的，她在旧社会那种凄苦、忧愁、穷困的沉暗生活，使她萦绕于空虚和幻觉里，寄希望于来世；使她那年青的生命，像枯了的花，褪色了的缎带。她很年青就成为寡妇，她时常叹息说活着是受罪；但不管怎样苦，她依靠着她的娘家，终于把女儿养大了。待她女儿出嫁，她就到女儿那里去，依靠女儿过活。她的女婿，也是种田人，生活并不好，她自己的心也很难受。但除了这，她还有什么办法呢？
    跑进村里，我的眼光就落在长婶住过那地方，那所破房子没有了，房子的旧址被人拿来开辟做菜园，我还来不及想想长婶是怎样，许多人都向我跑来了。
    我打算探问一下，长婶是否死了？长婶要是还活着，她一定来看我，现在，不见她来，大约她已不在人世。因此，我就不提长婶了。
    晚上，我到外面去和乡亲们闲聊回来，已经是深夜了。刚掩上门，准备休息，忽然有一个头发全白的老妇人，悄悄地推门进来，我心里怔了一下。怎么？长婶还活着？
    大约是她见我愕然地凝望着她，她就和蔼地对我说：“你还认得我吗？”她还没让我回答，又接续着说：“我早就说了，你会回来的，你喝过咱们乡里这口井的水，一定会回来的。”
    我请她坐下来，仔细端详她，她很老了，满脸皱纹，牙齿脱落了许多，不过，看来她的身体还行。我问她过得好不好。她笑着说：“这还用问哩，你长婶活到了今天，难道还耽心饿死不是？”跟着，她就欢欣地告诉我，解放后她从女儿那边回来，分到了地，分到了一座碉楼，村里建立农业合作社，她就在社里，有时放放牛，有时给带儿组看看孩子，单靠自己的劳动，还能维持自己的生活，转高级社之后，她被评为“五保户”，生活就更红火了。
    我见她心情很开朗，好像有些话对我说，但又说不出来，我正想问她，她却说我在旅途上疲劳，要早点歇息，推辞走了。我很兴奋，不想睡了，我坐在火油灯下，凝神地呆想起来：她虽然年老了，但生命没有萎谢，没有失色。
    第二天，我瞅个空儿去看她，看她有啥话对我说。我跑到碉楼门口，看见里面有一个骨胳粗大的老头儿，他的头已经光秃，胡须雪白，看来像一个北方人。他专心在编织竹篮。这个人我不认识他，我心里奇怪，为什么长婶的家里有个老头儿呢？
    长婶不在家，我和老头两个聊开了。
    这老头也是一个无亲无戚，无所依靠的“五保户”，乡里的人，认为他和长婶的人品都很好，要是他们两人能住在一起，彼此互相照顾，这对他们本人有好处，对社也有好处。于是，征求他们的意见，他们经过考虑，都同意了，人们就把老头搬到这碉楼里来了。老头跨进了这碉楼的门限，变年青了。他们住在一起，过得很好，一种强烈的温暖家庭的感觉，使他们的精神和生活，更紧密地跟新社会交融起来。
    我坐了好一会，长婶还没有回来，我就走了，但还用无限依恋的眼光，不断回头看。
    下晌，我要赶上最后一班车离开，长婶来送行。她抱歉地说：
    “你去看我，我偏不在家，害你白跑了。”
    “我没有白跑，我虽然没有见到你，但我见到……你的生活很好。”
    她和人们送我出了村，人们回去了，但她没有回去；她送我到大桥桥头，我劝她回去，她依然不肯回去。到了山边，山边的路是比较崎岖的，我就故意坐下来，好让她回家去。她见我坐下来，样子就有点烦乱，又有点为难。我看出她像昨夜去看我时一样，心里有些话要说，但又不肯说出来，我就问她。她沉吟了一会，才说：“侄呀：听说有些长生不死的药哩？是吗？”
    我一时搞不清楚，为什么她没头没脑想起这话来。长生不死的药，除了在古代神话中，我还没有听说过。于是，我照实对她说：
    “我还没有听说有这种药呀。”
    她楞住了，好像发觉她说错了话，又好像怀疑我对老年人的尊敬。我急急补充说：
    “将来或许会有的，要是有，我就叫人捎一点回来。”
    她笑了。但又用责备自己的口气说：“唉，再过两年就满七十了，还不愿意死哩！”
