Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: Moscow newspapers today published the speech made by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on January 22nd at the Conference of Advanced Agricultural Producers in Belarus.

Khrushchev said that the high-speed growth of product production is the current characteristic of Soviet agricultural development. If we compare the annual growth of agricultural product production and procurement in the last three or four years with the previous years, the difference is very large. From 1954 to 1957, Soviet grain production increased by an average of 27% per year compared to each year from 1950 to 1953, and procurement increased by 22%; cotton production and procurement increased by 13% and 12% respectively; meat increased by 26% and 51% respectively; and milk increased by 29% and 62% respectively.

Khrushchev said that along with the development of Soviet industry, socialist agriculture is also constantly advancing. In 1957, the procurement of live livestock increased by 550,000 tons compared to 1956, and by 1.4 million tons compared to 1953. In 1957, the production of animal oil was 77,000 tons more than in 1956, and 282,000 tons more than in 1953.

Khrushchev pointed out that the cash income of collective farms has also increased. It was 42.8 billion rubles in 1952, and reached 94.6 billion rubles in 1956, an increase of 1.2 times, and the income in 1957 will be even more.

Khrushchev said that from these figures, it can be concluded that the increase in product production in recent years confirms the consolidation of Soviet agricultural achievements.

Speaking of the significance of machine and tractor stations in modern conditions, Khrushchev said that machine and tractor stations played a historically significant role in establishing a new socialist economic system in rural areas. Machine and tractor stations acted as organizers of large-scale production and guides to technological progress. They played a huge political role and promoted the transition of individual peasant economies to collective farms.

Now that the collective farms have been consolidated, farm cadres capable of solving any task have grown up, the Party organizations in the countryside have been consolidated, and the Party committees have begun to pay more in-depth attention to the economy, and the people who lead these Party committees are generally people with more comprehensive theoretical training, at this time, there is no need to put the role of production organizers on the machine and tractor stations. Khrushchev said, isn't it better to sell the machines to the collective farms and let them use the technology and operate themselves? He said that undoubtedly, transferring the machines to the direct producers of the products will promote the universal upsurge of the economy, and perhaps will promote the growth of the total product. And this means that the amount of products controlled by the state will not only not decrease, but will certainly increase. Both collective farms and the state can benefit. Machines will be used more rationally, and collective farms will only buy those machines that they need.

Khrushchev emphasized that the reorganization of the work of machine and tractor stations is one of the fundamental issues for further developing agriculture.

    赫鲁晓夫谈苏联农业当前发展特点
    几年来各种农产品高速度增长证实农业成就巩固
    把机器卖给集体农庄将进一步促进农业普遍高涨
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：莫斯科报纸今天刊登了苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫1月22日在白俄罗斯农业先进生产者会议上的讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，产品生产的高速度增长是苏联农业当前发展的特点。如果把最近三、四年里农产品的生产和采购的每年增长额同以前的几年比较一下，那么这个差别是非常大的。在1954年到1957年期间，苏联谷物生产平均每年比1950到1953年期间的每一年增加27％，采购量增加22％；原棉的生产和采购量分别增加13％和12％；肉类分别增加26％和51％；牛奶分别增加29％和62％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在苏联工业发展的同时，社会主义农业也在不断地前进。1957年活牲畜的采购量比1956年增加了五十五万吨，比1953年增加了一百四十万吨。1957年动物油的生产比1956年多七万七千吨，比1953年多二十八万二千吨。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，集体农庄的现金收入也增多了。它在1952年是四百二十八亿卢布，1956年就达到九百四十六亿卢布，增加了一点二倍，而1957年的收入还要更多。
    赫鲁晓夫说，从这些数字可以得出结论，近年来产品生产的提高证实了苏联农业成就的巩固。
    在谈到机器拖拉机站在现代条件下的意义时，赫鲁晓夫说，机器拖拉机站在农村确立新的社会主义经济制度方面起了具有历史意义的作用。机器拖拉机站作了大生产的组织者、技术进步的向导。它们起了巨大的政治作用，促进了个体农民经济向集体农庄的过渡。
    而现在，集体农庄巩固了，能够解决任何任务的农庄干部成长起来了，农村中的党组织巩固了，党的委员会开始更深入地注意经济了，而领导这些党委员会的一般都是有较充分理论修养的人，在这个时候，就没有必要把生产组织者的作用放在机器拖拉机站的身上了。赫鲁晓夫说，把机器卖给集体农庄，让他们自己运用技术、进行经营，不是更好吗。他说，无疑地，把机器转让给产品的直接生产者，将促进经济的普遍高涨，也许会促进总产品的增长。而这就意味着国家所掌握的产品数量不仅不减少，反而一定会增加。集体农庄和国家都可得到好处。机器将运用得更合理，集体农庄将只买它们所需要的那些机器。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，机器拖拉机站工作的改组是进一步发展农业的根本问题之一。
