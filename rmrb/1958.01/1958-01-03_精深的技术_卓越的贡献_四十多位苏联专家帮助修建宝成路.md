Profound Technology, Outstanding Contributions
Over Forty Soviet Experts Helped Build the Baoji-Chengdu Railway

(Our dispatch) During the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, it received comprehensive and systematic assistance from more than forty Soviet experts. Consequently, over one hundred and sixty major problems, including surveying, design, and construction, were successfully resolved.

The complexity of the terrain and geological conditions along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and the arduousness of the project, are rare in the history of railway construction in our country. Soviet experts first proposed the suggestion of "perfect design before construction." Our engineering and technical personnel accepted this suggestion, and made meticulous calculations in advance, from the surveying and design of the line, the economic investigation along the line, slope limits, construction organization, to the installation of bridges. Soviet line expert Shokin suggested using vertical curves instead of the originally designed parabolas when determining the slope of the line, shortening the slope of the line. In the Chengdu to Mianyang section alone, more than 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork were reduced. The section from Baoji to Dongheqiao was the most difficult of the entire line. Construction expert Baskukin suggested changing the slope limit of this section from 20‰ to 30‰, using electric locomotives with double-engine traction, shortening the line by eighteen kilometers, and shortening the total length of the tunnels from twenty-five kilometers to fourteen kilometers, reducing the entire project by one-third. Based on the suggestion of expert Shaburi, Jialing River Bridges No. 1 and No. 2 had four fewer spans, and the Baishui River Bridge did not increase its span, greatly saving project costs and time. Expert Ruda introduced Soviet complete sets of standard drawings, standardized design drawings, and design theories and methods, which improved the quality of the design work of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway line is long, uses a lot of manpower and material resources, and there is mutual interference between the line and the highways and rivers, and between the construction sites. Therefore, arranging the construction sequence and the use of manpower and material resources became an extremely complicated organizational task. Construction organization experts Troyanov and Ovcharov imparted advanced Soviet construction organization designs to the construction personnel. Comrade Troyanov inspected the construction situation of the Chengdu to Mianyang section and proposed thirty-nine construction methods, solving problems such as the rational use of manpower and material resources and the elimination of interference. Comrade Ovcharov put forward forty-seven suggestions, compiled a comprehensive construction organization design, and implemented construction industrialization, mechanization, and structural standardization. Due to the adoption of the above suggestions, not only was the project quality good when building the Qingjiang Bridge, but also the project cost was reduced by 20%. Comrade Ovcharov also suggested dividing the railway construction into three stages of use: running construction trains, opening temporary business, and officially handing over to the state for use, so as to fully utilize railway transportation potential and state funds.

After leaving the western Sichuan Plain, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway crosses turbulent rivers such as the Fujiang, Tuojiang, and Jialing Rivers, and passes through many large mountains with continuous peaks and overlapping mountains. Soviet experts, unafraid of hardships, climbed mountains and waded through rivers, imparting the technology of building tunnels, bridges, and splitting mountains to open roads. The various tunnel excavation, lining, and grouting methods introduced by tunnel expert Salter Zevillagde increased the tunnel excavation progress from more than forty meters per day to one hundred meters. After grouting, all 304 tunnels on the entire line were basically kept dry and leak-free all year round, extending their service life. Large blasting expert Chechikin proposed using large-scale blasting to split mountains and open roads, and trained a group of engineering technicians and blasting workers for us, so that blasting projects across the entire line were quickly launched. Converting the Sanxian Bridge to large-scale blasting, making high embankments, and converting the Sanxian Tunnel to abandoned large-scale blasting, making deep trenches alone saved 520,000 yuan. In a large blasting at Qingshi Cliff in the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, more than 300 tons of explosives were used, and the blasting area reached 235,000 cubic meters, which enabled the northern section of the project to be completed ahead of schedule.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway line passes through earthquake zones and landslide areas, and geological hazards are very serious, including fault landslides, karst cave collapses, groundwater, and debris flows. In order to overcome these hazards, Soviet design, geology, and roadbed experts put forward solutions to eradicate the hazards, and personally went to the site to investigate the design and guide the construction. There were three major landslides at Baishui River Station, which were very harmful. Geological expert Dudayev and roadbed expert Zhilichov suggested building a ten-meter-thick concrete earth retaining wall, building a seepage blind ditch behind the wall to drain the groundwater inside the landslide, and building blind caves on the hillside, thereby eradicating the landslide hazards.

Expert Zagandayev said: "In railway construction and in transportation, as long as we understand, we will do our best to help the Chinese people." Fifty-year-old engineering organization expert Troyanov had just arrived in Chengdu in 1952, and as soon as he got off the train, he asked people to understand the construction situation of the entire line. When people asked him to rest on Sunday, he said: "I am here to work, not to rest." When expert Ovcharov inspected the project at Qianfu Bridge in the Chengdu-Mianyang section, he saw that the bridge was completed and several pieces of rubble were left untreated, and he severely criticized: "This is the style of a young master." The great internationalist spirit of the Soviet experts has set a brilliant example for us. (Li Raoding)

    精深的技术  卓越的贡献
    四十多位苏联专家帮助修建宝成路
    本报讯　宝成铁路修建期间，先后得到四十多位苏联专家的全面的系统的帮助，因而顺利地解决了包括勘测、设计、施工等的一百六十多项重大问题。
    宝成铁路沿线的地形地质情况的复杂，工程的艰巨，在我国修建铁路史上是罕见的。苏联专家首先提出“先有完善的设计而后施工”的建议。我国工程技术人员接受了这个建议，从线路的勘测设计、沿线的经济调查、坡度限制、施工组织到桥梁安砌等方面，事先都作了周密计算。苏联线路专家肖金在决定线路坡度的时候，建议用竖曲线代替原设计的抛物线，把线路坡度改短。仅成都到绵阳一段就减少了土石方工程十三万多立方公尺。宝鸡到东河桥一段是全线最艰巨的。工程专家巴斯库金建议把这段坡度限制由20％改为30％，用电气机车双机牵引，缩短了线路十八公里，隧道全长由二十五公里缩短到十四公里，全部工程减少了三分之一。根据专家沙布里的建议，嘉陵江一、二号桥减少了四个孔径，白水江大桥不增加孔径，大大节约了工程费用和时间。专家鲁达把苏联成套的标准图、定型设计图和设计理论方法介绍过来，提高了宝成铁路设计工作的质量。
    宝成铁路线路长，使用人力物力多，线路与公路河流之间，工点与工点之间相互干扰。因此，安排施工次序和人力物力的使用就成为一项极为繁杂的组织工作。施工组织专家特洛扬洛夫、奥夫洽洛夫把苏联先进的施工组织设计传授给了施工人员。特洛扬洛夫同志检查了成都到绵阳段的施工情况后，提出了三十九项施工方法，解决了合理使用人力物力以及排除干扰等问题。奥夫洽洛夫同志提出四十七项建议，编制了全面的施工组织设计，实行施工工厂化、机械化、结构标准化等。由于采纳了上述建议，修建清江大桥时不但工程质量良好，还降低了工程造价20％。奥夫洽洛夫同志还建议，把铁路修建分为行驶工程列车、开办临时营业和正式交付国家使用等三段使用方法，以充分利用铁路运输潜力和国家资金。
    宝成铁路出川西平原后，横跨涪江、沱江、嘉陵江等激流，穿过峰峦连绵山岭重叠的许多大山。苏联专家们不畏艰险，爬山涉水，传授修建隧道、桥梁、劈山开路的技术。隧道专家萨尔特热维拉杰介绍的各种隧道开挖衬砌灌浆方法，使隧道开挖进度由日进四十多公尺提高到一百公尺。全线三百零四座隧道，经过压浆基本上保持常年干燥、不漏水，延长了使用寿命。大爆破专家契契金，提出用大量爆破法劈山开路，并替我们训练了一批工程技术人员和爆破工人，使全线爆破工程很快地开展起来。仅把三线桥改为大量爆破，作高填方，和把三线隧道改为扬弃大量爆破，作深堑的，就节省费用五十二万元。宝成铁路北段青石崖的一次大爆破中，使用炸药三百多吨，爆破范围达二十三万五千立方公尺，使北段工程提前完成。
    宝成铁路线路经过地震区和坍方地区，地质病害十分严重，有断层滑坡、溶洞崩坍、地下水和流石流泥等。为了战胜病害，苏联设计、地质、路基等专家提出了根治病害的方案，并亲临现场考查设计，指导施工。白水江车站有三个大滑坡，危害甚大，地质专家杜达也夫和路基专家日里卓夫，建议修筑十公尺厚的混凝土御土墙，在墙后修渗水盲沟，排出滑坡内的地下水，以及在半山腰修建盲洞等，从而根治了滑坡病害。
    专家扎冈达也夫说：“在铁道建设上，在运输事业上，只要我们懂得，就全力帮助中国人民”。五十多岁的工程组织专家特洛扬洛夫1952年刚到成都，一下车就找人了解全线施工情况。星期天人家请他休息，他说：“我是来工作的，不是来休息的。”专家奥夫洽洛夫在成绵段千福桥检查工程时，见桥修完了剩下几块料石未处理，就十分严肃地提出批评说：“这是阔少爷的作风。”苏联专家伟大的国际主义精神，给我们树立了光辉的榜样。（李饶丁）
