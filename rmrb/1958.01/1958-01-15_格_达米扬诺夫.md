    Georgi Damyanov was a veteran fighter of the Bulgarian working class and the Communist Party. He was born into a poor peasant family in the Berkovitsa district in 1892. While in middle school, he actively participated in the socialist youth movement. At the age of twenty, he joined the "Close" faction of the Social Democratic Party, which, after reorganization in 1919, became the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    In September 1923, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Bulgarian people held the famous popular uprising against the fascist government. Comrade Damyanov was one of the leaders of the uprising. After the failure of the uprising, he and other comrades were forced into exile abroad, residing in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union successively.

    From 1924 to 1925 and from 1935 to 1936, Comrade Damyanov returned to Bulgaria to carry out secret revolutionary work. The reactionary Bulgarian government twice sentenced him to death in absentia. From the period of his second return to the country, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    From 1937 to 1943, he returned to the Soviet Union and participated in the responsible work of the Communist International and the Foreign Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    On September 9, 1944, after the liberation of Bulgaria, Comrade Damyanov immediately returned to his country and worked in the Central Committee of the Party. He made outstanding achievements in strengthening the people's democratic regime and thwarting the reactionary派's attempts to restore their power. From November 1946 to May 1950, he served as the Minister of National Defense. In May 1950, Comrade Damyanov was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly. In 1954 and 1958, he was re-elected twice in succession. In this position, he made valuable contributions to the socialist cause of Bulgaria.

    To commend Comrade Damyanov's achievements, the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly awarded him the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and the Dimitrov Medal on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday last year. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also awarded him the Order of Lenin at the same time.
