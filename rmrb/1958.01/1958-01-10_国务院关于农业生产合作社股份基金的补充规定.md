The "Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter" does not stipulate how to handle the share fund when the labor force of agricultural cooperative members' families increases or decreases, nor does it specify how demobilized soldiers, veterans, urban residents, staff of state organs, enterprises, and institutions, and young students going to the countryside should contribute to the share fund when joining cooperatives. In order to provide guidance for agricultural cooperatives in handling these issues, and in line with the spirit of encouraging urban residents and other non-agricultural populations to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, while appropriately taking into account the interests of original members, the following supplementary provisions are now made:

    I. When the labor force of agricultural cooperative members' families increases due to soldiers' demobilization, veterans' discharge, students' graduation, children's marriage, or children growing up, no further contribution to the share fund will be required. When the labor force decreases due to family members serving in the military, transferring to other jobs, children's marriage, aging, or death, the contributed share fund will not be refunded.

    II. Retired or resigned staff of state organs, enterprises, and institutions, demobilized soldiers, veterans, and urban residents who do not have family members living in the countryside and who are now newly participating in agricultural cooperatives generally must contribute to the share fund. However, since they do not have means of production to offset the share fund, and poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans have already been discontinued, if they are indeed in economic difficulty, they may, by referring to Article 21 of the "Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter," have their share fund deferred or reduced by decision of the members' congress or members' representatives' congress. In cases of special economic hardship, they may be exempted from contributing.

    III. Urban young students who go to the countryside to participate in agricultural cooperative production may be exempted from contributing to the share fund upon joining the cooperative, because they have not yet been employed and have no income.

    IV. Family members of staff of state organs and institutions, family members of enterprise workers, family members of military officers, etc., who return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, who already have family members in the cooperative and have contributed to the share fund, may not be required to contribute again. Those whose families had no members in the cooperative before, and who are now returning to their hometowns to join the cooperative, shall be handled in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article II.

    V. Staff of state organs and enterprises and institutions who are sent to agricultural cooperatives for labor training will not receive labor remuneration in the first year, because their salaries will be paid by their original units.

    Among them, those who participate in production in agricultural cooperatives for more than one year should contribute to the share fund, which should be offset by the labor day remuneration they should have received in the first year. If the labor day remuneration they should have received in the first year is more than the share fund they should contribute, the surplus may be recorded under the public accumulation fund of the agricultural cooperative, and the original unit and the agricultural cooperative should commend them. If the labor day remuneration they should have received in the first year is not enough to offset the share fund, the shortfall should be made up by the individual with the salary received from the original unit. If they are transferred out of the agricultural cooperative or leave the agricultural cooperative for any reason, this share fund shall be entirely transferred to the agricultural cooperative as a public accumulation fund.

    Personnel who participate in production labor training in agricultural cooperatives for a period not exceeding one year shall not receive labor remuneration, nor shall they contribute to the share fund. All labor day remuneration they should have received shall be donated to the agricultural cooperative as a public accumulation fund.

    VI. Family members of staff of state organs and institutions, revolutionary soldiers, enterprise workers, etc., in the countryside, who have not joined the cooperative due to lack of or loss of labor and rely on salaries from relatives working elsewhere, their future participation in the cooperative shall be entirely voluntary. Agricultural cooperatives should not force them to join the cooperative, nor should they demand share funds from them. However, their land should be cultivated by some means, or turned over to the agricultural cooperative for use, and should not be arbitrarily left barren.

    国务院关于农业生产合作社股份基金的补充规定
    （一九五七年十二月十三日国务院全体会议第六十五次会议通过）
    （一九五八年一月六日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十次会议批准）
    对于农业合作社社员家庭的劳动力增加或者减少的时候，他们的股份基金如何处理，以及复员军人、退伍军人、城市居民、国家机关和企业、事业单位的工作人员、青年学生下乡上山入社，应当如何交纳股份基金，这些问题，在高级农业生产合作社示范章程里没有规定。为了使农业合作社处理这些问题有所遵循，本着鼓励城市居民和其他非农业人口下乡上山参加农业生产的精神，同时适当地照顾原有社员利益的原则，现作如下的补充规定：
    一、农业合作社社员家庭中，因军人复员退伍、学生毕业、子女婚入、子女长大等原因增加了劳动力的，一律不再交纳股份基金。因家中有人服兵役、转业、子女婚出、衰老、死亡等原因减少了劳动力的，所交纳的股份基金一律不予退还。
    二、没有家属在农村居住的退职或者退休的国家机关和企业、事业单位的工作人员、复员军人、退伍军人和城市居民，现在下乡上山新参加农业合作社的，一般的都要交纳股份基金。但是，由于他们没有生产资料可以抵交股份基金，贫农合作基金贷款又已经停止发放，如果在经济上确实困难的，可以援引高级农业生产合作社示范章程第二十一条的规定，由社员大会或者社员代表大会决定，其股份基金可以缓交或者少交。在经济上特殊困难的可以免交。
    三、城市青年学生下乡上山参加农业合作社生产，因为他们本人尚未就业，原来并无收入，入社时可以免交股份基金。
    四、国家机关和事业单位的工作人员的家属、企业职工家属、军官家属等回乡参加农业生产的，凡是家里已经有人入社并且交纳了股份基金的，可以不再交纳；原来家中无人入社，现在回乡入社的，照第二条有关规定办理。
    五、国家机关和企业、事业单位的工作人员下放到农业合作社进行劳动锻炼的，因为第一年由原机关照发工资，所以他们第一年不取劳动报酬。
    其中，在农业合作社参加生产超过一年的，应该交纳股份基金，就用第一年应得的劳动日报酬抵交。如果第一年应得的劳动日报酬多于应交的股份基金，可将多余的部分，记入农业合作社的公积金项下，并由原机关和农业合作社予以表扬；如果第一年应得的劳动日报酬，不足抵交股份基金，不足部分由本人用从原机关领得的工资补足。调出农业合作社或者因故脱离农业合作社的，这项股份基金全部转归农业合作社做为公积金。
    在农业合作社参加生产劳动锻炼为期不超过一年的人员，一律不取劳动报酬，也不交纳股份基金，他们应得的劳动日报酬，全部赠予农业合作社做为公积金。
    六、凡是国家机关和事业单位的工作人员、革命军人、企业职工等在农村的家属，因缺乏或者丧失劳力没有入社而依靠外出亲属薪给供养的，他们今后是否入社完全由其自愿，农业合作社不要强迫他们入社，也不要向他们索取股份基金。但是，他们的土地应该设法耕种，或者交农业合作社使用，不得任意荒芜。
