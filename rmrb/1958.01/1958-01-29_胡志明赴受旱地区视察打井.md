Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 28th. President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam visited Hung Son Commune, Dong Anh County, Vinh Phuc Province, more than 20 kilometers north of Hanoi on the 27th, to inspect the local people's efforts to combat drought by drilling wells using Chinese experience.

In Hung Son Commune, several Chinese experts and workers who recently arrived in Vietnam to assist in drought relief are working with Vietnamese cadres and farmers to test-dig four different types of water wells. President Ho Chi Minh listened to the Chinese experts' introduction of the well-drilling methods and viewed the wells that had already produced water, the wells being dug, and various well-digging and water-pumping tools. President Ho Chi Minh spoke to the local cadres and people, urging them to learn the well-drilling experience well so that the experience could be promoted throughout the region. The drought-stricken area of Vinh Phuc Province lacks surface water sources, and drought relief work faces considerable difficulties; however, Chinese experts have found that the area has abundant groundwater resources after surveying the area. It is estimated that the four wells currently being dug can irrigate 20 hectares of dry land.

    胡志明赴受旱地区视察打井
    新华社河内28日电　越南民主共和国胡志明主席在27日到河内北面二十多公里的永福省东英县雄山乡，视察当地人民试行采用中国经验来打井抗旱的情况。
    在雄山乡，最近到越南协助进行抗旱工作的几位中国专家和工人正在同越南干部和农民一起试挖四口不同类型的水井。胡志明主席听中国专家介绍了打井的方法，并且观看已经出水和正在挖掘的水井以及各种挖井和抽水的用具。胡志明主席向当地的干部和人民讲了话，要他们好好学习打井经验，以便把打井经验推广到各地。永福省受旱地区缺少地面水源，抗旱工作遇到较大困难；但是，中国专家勘测后发现这个地区的地下水源丰富。目前，正在挖掘的四口水井，估计可以灌溉旱地二十公顷。
