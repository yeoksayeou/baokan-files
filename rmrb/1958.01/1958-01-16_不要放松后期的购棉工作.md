    Do not relax the post-purchase cotton work
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The 1957 cotton unified purchase work has entered the later stage of acquisition and the final stage, and the season for large-scale centralized cotton marketing has passed. The main task now is to acquire all the scattered commodity cotton from agricultural cooperatives, members, and individual farmers. The task is still very arduous.
    The 1957 cotton unified purchase work was carried out under extremely favorable conditions such as the attention and importance attached by party organizations and governments at all levels, the widespread and in-depth development of the socialist debate in rural areas, and the bumper cotton harvest. Generally speaking, the acquisition progress was faster than in any previous year, and the grade and quality of cotton were also better than in any previous year. The state's unified purchase task can not only be completed, but many places can also over fulfill it. However, many regions, seeing that the cotton unified purchase work was proceeding smoothly and that the unified purchase task had been completed or was close to completion, developed an impermissible slack mood in the later stage of the purchase work. The purchasing units and personnel in some areas mistakenly believed that there was not much cotton to be purchased now, and they even canceled cotton collection points that should not have been canceled and transferred purchasing personnel. This practice is inconsistent with the central government's policy of unified purchase of all commodity cotton and the requirement to collect as much as possible.
    It should be recognized that it is normal for the cotton source to be less concentrated and the acquisition progress to be slower than before as the cotton purchase work enters the later and final stages. But we must not therefore think that there is no cotton to be collected. According to many typical materials from Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and other places, it is estimated that about three million dan of cotton have not been acquired in rural areas across the country. Jiangsu and other provinces and cities still have some regions with later seasons, which are cleaning up cotton fields. Some areas are waiting for the cotton picked at home to be spread and processed due to rain or insufficient manpower. Although the cotton fields in some areas have been cleaned up and the cotton stalks have been pulled out, there are still many cotton bolls, catkins, and petals left on the cotton stalks due to rough work. The bottom of the warehouses of some agricultural cooperatives and production teams is still to be cleaned up. There are also cotton grown by members' private plots and individual farmers, as well as cotton that should be sold in more quantities. In short, there are still many sources of cotton purchase. Whether the state's unified purchase of all commodity cotton can be realized depends on whether these cotton can be acquired.
    Organizing the masses to pick up the cotton bolls, catkins, and petals left on the cotton stalks is also an important link in doing a good job in the later stage of cotton purchase and increasing the income of cotton farmers. Most areas have mobilized the masses to pick up fallen cotton, eyelashes, and stiff petals, and have achieved great results. It is estimated that this work alone can acquire or reduce the loss of more than one million dan of cotton. This is a great benefit to the country and cotton farmers. However, many areas do not pay enough attention to this work, thinking that picking cotton bolls, catkins, and petals on the pulled cotton stalks is a lot of effort and little income, and not worth the loss. Many agricultural cooperatives even distributed the cotton stalks to members as firewood, which is a great waste. As some farmers say, "You can't find all the melons, and you can't pick all the flowers." Thirty agricultural cooperatives in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, found more than 20,000 jin of seed cotton on 1.91 million jin of cotton stalks. The county has 22 million jin of cotton stalks, and it is expected to find more than 500,000 jin of seed cotton. This shows that as long as you look carefully, you can find a lot of cotton.
    Recently, many supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to help agricultural cooperatives and members clean up the cotton left on the cotton stalks, have taken the initiative to consult with agricultural cooperatives to understand the processing of seed cotton, whether the pulled cotton stalks have been cleaned up, and the approximate amount of cotton in the members' private plots and individual farmers. Then, under the leadership of the local party and government, they help the agricultural cooperatives to arrange labor in a unified manner, organize the old, weak, women, children and other semi-laborers to pick the cotton on the cotton stalks, and appropriately stipulate labor remuneration. These methods have achieved good results in encouraging members to pick up all the cotton. Therefore, it is hoped that the areas where the work is done roughly will learn from the experience of advanced areas and carry out a make-up lesson.
    Local experience has proved that in order to achieve the goal of collecting all commodity cotton, it is also necessary to strictly implement the principle of agricultural cooperatives and members retaining less and selling more, retaining inferior cotton and selling good cotton to the state. In the past year, all localities have also made great achievements and created many successful experiences in conscientiously implementing the policy of appropriately reducing the amount of cotton retained by cotton farmers. For example, 86 agricultural cooperatives in Guanxian County, Shandong Province, retained an average of 1 jin and 12 taels of cotton per member, which was 74,700 jin less lint cotton than the national standard, and sold all of it to the state. Twenty-eight agricultural cooperatives in Xincheng area of ​​Shulu County, Hebei Province, had eight cooperatives retaining inferior cotton, and seventeen cooperatives retaining half good cotton and half inferior cotton, and converted the national cotton retention quota into cash and distributed it to the members, and then the members purchased according to actual needs. Experience has proved that it is feasible and effective to adopt the method of unified control by agricultural cooperatives, giving money when needed, giving cotton when needed, and making up the price for inferior cotton. In the later stage of cotton purchase, the Qiaozhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jin County, Hebei Province, cooperated with the agricultural cooperatives to hold a forum for single households and cotton growers in private plots, repeatedly explained the national unified purchase policy, and specifically organized the delivery of cotton. In one go, it collected more than 300 jin of cotton produced in private plots from 44 households in Houcheng Village, and more than 5,000 jin of cotton from individual cotton farmers.
    In order to implement the policy of acquiring all commodity cotton, it is also necessary to strengthen the management of the domestic cloth market and plug the loopholes in cotton loss. The Xinfacheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, cooperated with the market management department and cleared out more than 100 jin of seed cotton and more than 700 chi of domestic cloth in Tongshan Township Four Village alone that were prepared for domestic spinning. Similar phenomena in other regions are also very serious. If this activity is not resolutely stopped, it will bankrupt the state's policy of unified purchase of all commodity cotton. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly ban domestic cloth vendors, implement the national cotton unified purchase policy from the administrative management level, and plug all loopholes that may cause loss and waste of cotton.

    不要放松后期的购棉工作
    本报评论员
    1957年度的棉花统购工作，已进入后期收购和扫尾阶段，棉花大量集中上市的季节已经过去。今后的任务主要是把分散在农业社、社员和个体农民手里的零星商品棉全部收购上来，任务仍然是十分艰巨的。
    1957年度的棉花统购工作，是在各级党组织和政府领导重视、农村社会主义大辩论普遍深入开展和棉花丰收等极为有利的条件下进行的。一般说来，收购进度比以往任何一年都快，棉花的品级、质量也比以往任何一年都好。国家的统购任务不仅可以完成，而且不少地方还可以超额完成。但是也有不少地区看到棉花统购工作进行得较为顺利，统购任务已经完成或接近完成，就在购棉工作的后期产生了不能允许的松劲情绪。有些地区的采购单位和采购人员错误地认为现在已没有多少棉花可收，竟把不应该撤销的收棉点撤销了，把采购人员调走了。这种作法是与中央关于统购全部商品棉的政策和能多收一斤就多收一斤的要求不相符的。
    应该认识到，在购棉工作进入后期和扫尾阶段，棉源不如以前集中，收购进度不如以前快，是正常的现象。但决不能因此就认为没有什么棉花可收了。根据河北、山东、江苏等地不少典型材料来推算，全国农村还约有三百万担棉花没有收购进来。江苏和其他省、市尚有若干季节较晚的地区，正在清理棉田。有的地区由于阴雨或人力不足，摘到家里的棉花尚待摊晒和加工。部分地区的棉田虽已清理完毕，拔完了棉秸，但由于工作粗糙，棉秸上仍遗留不少的棉桃、花絮、花瓣。有的农业社、生产队的库底尚待清理。社员的自留地和个体农民种的棉花，以及多分还应出售的棉花等等。总之，购棉的来源还是很多的。国家统购全部商品棉能否实现，关键就在于能否把这些棉花收购上来。
    组织群众把遗留在棉秸上的棉桃、花絮、花瓣拾干拣净，也是做好后期购棉工作、增加棉农收入的一个重要环节。大部地区发动群众拾摘落地棉、眼睫毛和僵瓣花，收效很大。估计仅这一项工作，就可多收购或少流失一百多万担棉花。这对国家、对棉农都是一笔极大的收益。但是也有不少地区对这项工作不够重视，认为在拔下来的棉秸上拾摘棉桃、花絮、花瓣，是费力大，收入少，得不偿失。还有不少农业社竟把棉秸分给社员当柴烧了，这是很大的浪费。正如有些农民所说：“找不净的瓜，摘不净的花”。河北武清县三十个农业社，在一百九十一万斤棉秸上找出籽棉二万多斤，全县有二千二百万斤棉秸，预计可找到五十多万斤籽棉。由此可见，只要认真地查找，就可以找到不少棉花。
    最近不少供销社为了帮助农业社和社员把遗留在棉秸上的棉花拾摘干净，主动地同农业社进行协商，了解留种棉加工、拔下来的棉秸是否已经找干净、社员自留地和个体农民的棉花大体有多少等概况，然后在当地党政领导下，帮助农业社统一安排劳动力，组织老弱、妇女、儿童等半劳力，拾摘棉秸上的棉花，并适当规定劳动报酬。这些办法都收到了鼓舞社员把棉花拾干拣净的良好效果。因此希望工作做得粗糙的地区，仿照先进地区的经验，普遍地进行一次补课。
    各地经验证明，要达到把全部商品棉收足的目的，还必须严格执行农业社和社员少留、多卖，留次棉、卖好棉给国家的方针。一年来，各地在认真贯彻执行适当压缩棉农自留量的政策方面，也做出了很大成绩，创造了不少成功的经验。例如山东省冠县有八十六个农业社，每个社员平均留棉一斤十二两，比国家规定的留量标准少留七万四千七百多斤皮棉，并全部卖给了国家。河北束鹿县新城地区的二十八个农业社，留次棉的有八个，留好棉和次棉各半的有十七个，并把国家规定的留棉量折成现款，分给社员，然后由社员根据实际需要购买。经验证明，采取由农业社统一掌握，要钱给钱，要棉给棉，要次棉找补差价的办法是可行的，效果也是良好的。河北省晋县樵镇供销社在进入后期购棉阶段，协同农业社召开了单干户和自留地种棉户座谈会，反复讲解国家统购政策，并具体地组织交售，一次就在侯城村收进四十四户自留地产的棉花三百多斤，个体棉农的棉花五千多斤。
    为了贯彻执行收购全部商品棉的政策，还必须加强对土布市场的管理，堵塞棉花流失的漏洞。四川中江县新发供销社配合市场管理部门，仅在通山乡四村就清查出准备搞土纺的皮棉一百多斤，土布七百多尺。其他地区类似现象也很严重。这种活动如不坚决加以制止，就会使国家收购全部商品棉的政策破产。因此必须严格取缔土布商贩，从行政管理上贯彻国家的棉花统购政策，堵塞一切可能流失浪费棉花的漏洞。
