　　The character "腊" (là) contains the meaning of "sacrifice." Ancient people believed that the year's agricultural work came to an end in the twelfth month. Farmers rested, and in this month, they combined the captured birds and beasts for sacrifice, to celebrate the year's harvest and to pray for a good harvest in the coming year. Therefore, the twelfth month is also called 腊月 (là yuè), or "Sacrifice Month."

　　In some ancient books, one often sees the words "腊鼓" (là gǔ), "Sacrifice Drum." This is because in ancient times, people beat drums in the twelfth month to drive away plague demons. The booming sound of the drums would cause the plague demons to flee far away. This foreshadowed that life in the coming spring would be happy and fulfilling!

　　The eighth day of the twelfth month is customarily called "腊八" (là bā), or the Laba Festival. In the lunar calendar, "腊八" falls roughly between "大寒" (dà hán, Major Cold) and "立春" (lì chūn, Beginning of Spring), and the weather is particularly cold. People all know the saying: "On the seventh and eighth days of the twelfth month, the crows freeze to death!"

　　On "腊八," people throughout the country, both in the north and the south, cook and eat Laba porridge. Legend has it that this day is the day when the Buddha Sakyamuni attained enlightenment. Initially, only temples held bathing Buddha ceremonies and cooked porridge with fragrant grains and fruits to offer to the Buddha. Later, ordinary households—especially farmers—also imitated it, and it has continued to this day. Farmers like to do this, and it is still inseparable from production. Because Laba porridge is cooked with various beans, dried melon, grains, etc., cooking such a pot of porridge after a year of hard work is also a review of the year's labor achievements.

　　Speaking of Laba porridge, although the name is the same, the contents are different: there are coarse and fine distinctions, and sweet and salty variations. The general method for cooking porridge is to first select and wash barley rice, white kidney beans, red kidney beans, cowpeas, red beans, mung beans, etc., and cook them until they are half-cooked. Then add white rice, millet, yellow rice, and glutinous rice. Add enough water at once, and do not add water as you cook. When cooking the porridge, first use a strong fire, and when the rice is about to bloom, switch to a gentle fire, stirring as you cook to prevent sticking to the bottom. In addition, cook red dates and chestnuts (peeled) until cooked through, and add them when the porridge is done. Add brown sugar or white sugar when eating. There is also a fine Laba porridge, which omits several of the former porridge ingredients and adds lotus seeds, Job's tears, water chestnut rice, and ginkgo nuts. Add dried longan pulp after cooking.

　　In some places, Laba porridge is cooked salty. In addition to the aforementioned rice and beans, add rapeseed (washed, chopped, and stir-fried in oil), and peeled taro, broad beans, fried tofu, etc. Add an appropriate amount of salt when the porridge is almost cooked.

　　Customarily, Laba porridge is given as a gift to each other. On this day, housewives get up as early as possible, even rising before dawn to cook the porridge. When the porridge is cooked, before it is fully light, the porridge is served, and brown sugar and shredded green and red ginger are sprinkled on the surface. Some even put on a flower basket or lion's head made of golden thread dates, melon seeds, etc., as decorations and distribute them to neighbors, relatives, and friends. The other party also returns the porridge cooked by her family, seemingly in a competition of whose porridge is better. This custom adds a lot of interest to life in the cold winter.

　　Most families eat dumplings during the Spring Festival, and eating dumplings with Laba vinegar is even more flavorful. Laba vinegar is made on Laba day by peeling garlic cloves and putting them in vinegar (the ratio of vinegar to garlic is about two heads of garlic to one catty of vinegar), sealing them in a bottle, and placing them in a warmer place. On New Year's Eve, the bottle is opened, and the vinegar becomes spicy, the garlic becomes sour, and the garlic cloves turn into emerald green, which is not only beautiful but also delicious.

    腊八杂谈
    左宦
    腊字含有“祭”的意思。古人以为一年的农作业，在十二月告一段落，农民休息，就在此月把打来的禽兽，合在一起祭祀，以庆祝当年的丰收和为来年丰收作祈祷。因此，十二月又叫腊月。
    在一些古书上，常看见有“腊鼓”二字，这是因为古人在腊月有击鼓驱除疫鬼的事情。咚咚的鼓声，会使疫鬼逃避远遁。这里预示着，明春的生活将是幸福美满的！
    十二月八日，这天在习俗上又叫“腊八”。在农历上，“腊八”大约处于“大寒”“立春”之间，天气特别冷。人们都知道有这样一句话：“腊七腊八冻死寒鸦！”
    “腊八”这天，我国不分南北，家家都要煮锅腊八粥吃。相传这天是佛祖释迦牟尼成道日，最初只是寺院里举行浴佛会，并用香谷果实等煮粥敬佛，后来普通人家——尤其是农家也都模仿起来，相沿至今。农民喜欢这样作，还是与生产分不开的。因为腊八粥是用各种豆类和瓜干、粮食等煮的，在一年辛勤劳动之后，煮这样一锅粥，也是对一年的劳动成绩的检阅。
    谈起腊八粥来，名称虽一，但内容却不相同：有粗细之分，甜咸之别。一般粥的煮法，是先把大麦米、白云豆、红云豆、江豆、赤小豆、绿豆等，拣好洗净，煮成半熟；然后再放入白米、小米、黄米和江米。水要一次加足，不要随煮随加水。煮粥时先用旺火，等米快开花了，再换文火，随煮随搅，不要粘底。另外，将红枣、栗子（去皮）煮熟，等粥煮好投入，吃时再加红糖或白糖。还有一种细腊八粥，就是把前者粥料，略去数种，再加入莲子、薏仁米、菱角米和白果等，煮成后再加上桂圆肉。
    有的地方的腊八粥是煮咸的，除上述米豆外，再加油菜（油菜洗净切碎用油炒过），和去皮芋头、蚕豆、油炸豆腐等。粥快熟时放入适量的盐。
    在习俗上，腊八粥是互相餽送的。这天，家庭主妇们起得愈早愈好，甚至五更头就起来煮粥。等粥煮好，天还没有十分亮，把粥盛好，在粥面上撒上红糖和青丝、红丝，有的还放上一个用金丝枣、瓜子仁之类作成的花篮或狮子头等装饰品，分赠邻舍亲友。对方也以她家所煮的粥回赠，似乎在比赛谁家的粥好。这个风气，无形中给严寒的冬天，增添了不少生活的兴趣。
    春节里大多数人家要吃饺子，吃饺子蘸腊八醋更别有风味。腊八醋是在腊八这天把大蒜头剥好，投入醋内（醋与蒜的比例，约是两头大蒜兑一斤醋），装瓶封严，放在较暖的地方。到除夕日启瓶开封，醋变辣了，蒜变酸了，蒜头变成翡翠般的绿色，不但好看，而且好吃。
