    Hunting on Elephant Back
    Zhan Chao
    Towards evening, we arrived at a tribal village. This was one of the many small tribes of the Phnong people in the Kingdom of Cambodia, situated in a small clearing in the forest. The women were busily pounding rice with thick wooden pestles and carrying water in pottery jars on their heads; children chased each other amidst the chickens, ducks, pigs, and dogs in the nearby harvested rice paddies and cornfields, emitting joyous cries. Upon seeing the guests, the people automatically gathered around and led us to rest in a stilt house. As darkness slowly fell, almost all the men, women, and children of the tribe gathered on this spacious and sturdy stilt house, skillfully constructed of tree trunks and bamboo. Illuminated by the flickering pine torches and firelight, the house owner happily opened his treasured wine jar, inserted a reed straw, and, according to traditional custom, let the guests try a few sips first. Then, the eldest elders sprinkled a small amount of rice grains and salt on the mouth of the jar, chanting words of blessing for everyone's friendship and health. Thus began the joyful gathering and drinking. People sucked with reed straws while adding water to the wine jar. They didn't want to part until late at night.

    Several young and strong Phnong men, having prepared everything for the hunt, beckoned us to set off. We divided into three groups to hunt. My group consisted of only four people: a young Phnong man riding on the elephant's neck, holding a spiked fork to steer the giant beast; a spirited hunter riding slightly behind, his hunting lamp constantly searching in all directions; and my Overseas Chinese friend, Mr. Lin, and I, sitting on either side of the elephant saddle made of wood frames and woven rattan. The bottom layer of the saddle was padded with a kind of unknown tough and soft bark, so every time the giant beast took a step, you would feel a strong vibration.

    It is said that all kinds of wild animals live in this large forest, and herds of wild elephants appear from time to time. The hunter who accompanied us said that he had encountered wild elephants more than once. He said that elephants are very united. When they move, the young and strong ones lead and guard the rear, while the old and weak walk in the middle. The mother elephants even use their trunks to curl up and lift the baby elephants as they move forward. Hunters, besides trying to capture individual stray wild elephants, generally dare not touch the elephant herds, otherwise, they risk being attacked. When the elephant herd is approaching, experienced hunters can tell. They either avoid them or lie still in the trees because these massive creatures moving in herds, with their large ears constantly flapping, sound like a tide from afar.

    Since we climbed into the elephant saddle, I don't know how much time has passed or how far we have traveled, but we have not yet encountered a decent wild animal. We only heard crisp gunshots from the left and right from time to time, which were obviously the good news from the other two groups of friends. Our hunter seemed unmoved, still calmly letting the elephant move step by step into the depths of the forest, only occasionally using his hand to direct it to move to nearby pools and bushes. Suddenly, he spotted a pair of emerald-yellow eyes staring unblinkingly at the hunting lamp. The hunter took the opportunity to fire a shot, and we heard something jump twice before falling heavily. In the darkness, the elephant confidently walked forward step by step, finally finding the prey—a large yellow muntjac. Not long after, we shot another yellow muntjac that was also not small. Each time we reached the prey, the elephant obediently lowered its body at the command of the young rider, allowing Mr. Lin and me to dismount. Then the hunter quickly tied the still-warm yellow muntjac to the bottom of the elephant saddle, and our seats became higher and higher.

    The night grew deeper and deeper. Except for the elephant's heavy footsteps and the sound of it occasionally breaking branches in front with its long trunk, it was silent all around. Both of us felt a little tired, especially our legs, which became numb from being cramped for so long. If we stretched them out, we were afraid of being caught by the trees, so we repeatedly changed our sitting posture. But the two hunters and the rider were full of energy, and the hunting lamp continued to search around.

    After who knows how much more time, as the elephant walked into a low-lying area in the forest, the hunting lamp suddenly caught a pair of fierce, glittering eyes in the dense bushes. The hunter held his breath and fired a shot at it, but missed. The elephant turned a few circles and found the peculiar eyes again. As the hunter was correcting the angle and raising his gun to aim, the monster moved its eyes away. By the time he fired another shot, it had already escaped, leaving a gust of wind. After a moment of silence, the hunter whispered to us, "Tiger!" Upon hearing this, our nerves immediately tightened because "tiger" is what it meant.

    Before dawn, we returned to the tribal village where we had rested last night, followed by Mr. Qu, the Overseas Chinese friend who was skilled at hunting, and some Phnong hunters. By the time the third group returned, we were already asleep on the stilt house's terrace, fully clothed.

    When we woke up from the cold in the morning, we saw the strong Phnong men still half-naked. They casually set up some firewood on the ground to warm their hands and feet, then peeled the hides of the animals hunted last night, cutting the meat into pieces and roasting it to eat. The salt and tobacco we brought were warmly welcomed and distributed by the elderly elders, equally, to everyone in the tribe, even the children in pregnancy received the same portion. At this time, another joyful gathering and drinking began. The elephant, which had been working hard all night, was also enjoying a hearty breakfast of bananas and various wild fruits in the nearby fields.

    When it was time to say goodbye, the Phnong friends repeatedly urged us to come again next time to hunt on elephant back together, and on behalf of the hunters in faraway China, wished everyone a life of peace and friendship for generations to come.

    骑象打猎
    展潮
    傍晚时分，我们来到了一个部落。这是柬埔寨王国仆侬族的许多小部落里的一个，座落在森林中的一小片开阔地上。女人们正在忙碌地用粗大的木棒舂米、用头部顶着陶罐去取水；孩子们跟鸡、鸭、猪、狗，在附近收割过的干稻田和玉米地里互相追逐着，发出欢乐的嘶叫声。看见了客人，人们都自动围拢来，把我们让到一座高脚屋上休息。天色慢慢黑齐了，在这座用树干和竹片巧妙地造成的、宽大而牢固的高脚屋上面，聚集着几乎整个部落里的男、女和孩子们。在跳动不定的松明和火光照耀下，屋主人兴高采烈地把那珍贵的酒坛子打开，插进一根芦管，按照传统的习惯，让客人们先试几口，然后由年岁最大的长者们把少许米粒和咸盐洒在坛子口上，念念有词地为大家的友谊和健康祝福。于是欢乐的聚饮便开始了。人们一面用芦管吸着，一面往酒坛里添水。直到深夜还不想分手。
    几位年轻力壮的仆侬人把打猎的一切都准备停当了，招呼我们启程。我们分作三路去打猎。我这一路只有四个人：一位仆侬族青年骑在象脖子上，手里拿着把带刺的叉子在左右这头巨兽的行动；一位神采奕奕的猎手骑在稍后一些地方，他头上那盏猎灯不停地向四处探索着；我和华侨朋友林君坐在用木头作架子、以藤条编造成的象鞍的两侧，这象鞍的底层是用一种不知名的坚韧而绵软的树皮当垫子，因此每当那头巨兽移动一步，你都会感到一次强烈的震动。
    据说这个大森林里各种野兽都有，成群成群的野象也不时地出没着。和我们同行的猎手说，他不只一次地和野象照过面。他说象的团结性是很强的，每逢它们行动的时候，领头和压尾的都是些青壮年，老弱者走在中间，母象还用鼻管把小象卷着、高举着前进。猎人们除了设法捕捉个别迷途走失的野象外，一般都不敢触动象群的，否则就有遭受围攻的危险。当象群过来的时候，有经验的猎人是可以判断得出的，他们不是避开就是伏在树上不动，因为这些成群结队的庞然大物走起路来，两扇大耳朵还不断地搧动着，老远听去就仿佛是一片海潮声。
    我们自从爬进象鞍里，不知经过了多少时刻，也不知走过了多少路程，还没有遇见一头像样的野兽。只听到左边和右边不时传来清脆的枪声，那显然是另外两路朋友们的捷音了。我们的猎手似乎并不为所动，依然沉着地让那头象一步步走向森林的深处，只是偶尔用手指挥往旁边的池沼和草丛移动，忽然发现一副碧黄色的大眼珠对着猎灯凝然不动，猎手顺势给了一枪，只听见一个东西卜通地跳跃两下，便沉重地跌倒了。在黑暗里，那头大象却满有把握地一步步向前走，终于找到了猎获物——一头大黄?。不大一会，我们又打中了另一头也不太小的黄?。每次走到猎获物跟前，大象便顺从着青年御者的指挥伏低身子，让林君和我下来，这时猎手便快手快脚地把身上还有暖气的黄?缚在象鞍下面，于是我们的座位越来越高了。
    夜越来越深了，除了大象沉重的脚步以及它不时用长鼻管折断前面树枝的声音外，四下里一片寂静。我们两个人都有点倦意了，尤其难受的是两条腿，窝久了发麻，伸出去又怕给树木挂住，于是便三番两次地变换着坐的姿势。而那两位猎手和御者呢，精力却十分充沛，那盏猎灯不停地向四周探索着。
    又不知过了多少时刻，当大象走进森林中一片洼地里的当儿，猎灯突然在茂密的草丛中捉住了一副凶光闪闪的眼珠，猎手屏息住呼吸对着那里开了一枪，没有打中；大象转了几圈，又找见了那副奇特的眼珠。猎手正在校正角度托枪瞄准，那怪物却把眼珠移开了，等到补上一枪时，它已经逃走了，留下一阵风。沉默了一会儿，猎手才轻声地告诉我们说：“古”！我们一听，神经立刻为之紧张，因为“古”就是老虎的意思。
    在天亮之前，我们回到了昨晚歇脚的部落里，随后是那位擅长打猎的华侨朋友区君和一些仆侬猎人。等到第三路转来时，我们已经在高脚屋的露台上和衣熟睡了。
    早上冻醒的时候，看见强壮的仆侬人还是半裸着，他们在地上随便架起些柴火暖暖手脚，然后剥开昨夜猎获的兽皮，把肉切成一块块烤来吃。我们带来的咸盐和烟草受到热烈的欢迎，由年老的长者一份份地把它分开，一视同仁地送给部落里每一个人，连在怀孕中的孩子也得到同样的一份。这时候，又一次欢乐的聚饮开始了。劳累了一夜的大象，也在附近的野地里享受一顿丰美的早餐——巴蕉和各种野生果品。
    当告别的时候，仆侬族朋友们一再叮嘱下次再来一起骑象打猎，并代向遥远的中国的猎人们祝福，愿大家世世代代过着和平和友谊的生活。
