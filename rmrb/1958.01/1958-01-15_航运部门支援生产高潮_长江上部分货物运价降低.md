Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 14th: Starting in January, the Yangtze River shipping routes from Hankou to Chongqing and Luzhou to Hankou have reduced freight rates for twenty types of goods, including pig iron, steel billets, and fertilizer. This is a measure taken by the Yangtze River shipping department to support the high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

　　The freight rates for steel and other materials transported upstream to support industrial construction in the Southwest region have generally been reduced by 40% to over 60%. The freight rate for pig iron transported from Hankou to Chongqing was previously over 29 yuan per ton, but now it is only 14.5 yuan. The freight rate for refractory bricks has been reduced from over 32 yuan per ton to over 12 yuan. On the Yichang to Luzhou section, there were originally two different freight rates for upstream and downstream traffic. Now, the transport of four types of goods, including sacks, fertilizer, talcum powder, and ore, on this section will be calculated at the lower downstream rate.

    航运部门支援生产高潮
    长江上部分货物运价降低
    据新华社武汉14日电　长江航线汉口至重庆、泸州至汉口等段，自1月份起，降低了生铁、钢坯、肥田粉等二十种货物的运价。这是长江航运部门支援工农业生产高潮而采取的一项措施。
    上行支援西南地区的工业建设的钢、铁等物资，运价一般降低了40％到60％以上。过去从汉口运往重庆的生铁每吨运价二十九元多，现在只需十四元五角；耐火砖每吨运价由三十二元多降低到十二元多。宜昌至泸州段，原分上水下水两种不同运价，现在在这一段运送麻袋、肥田粉、滑石粉、矿石等四种物资，统按较低的下水运价计算。
