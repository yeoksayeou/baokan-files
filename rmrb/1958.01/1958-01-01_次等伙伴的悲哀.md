Notes

    The Tragedy of a Second-Rate Partner
    When answering a question posed by a journalist from "U.S. News & World Report" about what the United States could do to "help" France, French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard said that the most important thing the United States could do was to help foster a common view on African territories, especially North Africa; he also said that the United States should make efforts to achieve a common attitude on policies toward Arab countries; and that the United States should show the world that it recognizes the Algerian issue as France's affair and should not interfere. From these words, one can hear a bellyful of complaints about Washington. However, after saying all this, Gaillard suddenly made a 180-degree turn, saying what he thought the United States should do, which was in fact the opinion of the U.S. government.
    One cannot help but ask: Since Gaillard believes that this is the opinion of the U.S. government, then why did he bother to say so much? And who was he talking to?
    Clearly, his own colonial interests in the Middle East and North Africa are being coveted and encroached upon, and he couldn't help but complain a few words; however, he was afraid of offending the United States and had to make a self-contradictory compromise. Being a pathetic second-rate partner, even the freedom to complain is deprived, how pitiful!

    次等伙伴的悲哀
    在回答“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的记者所提出的，美国能够做些什么来“帮助”法国这一问题的时候，法国总理盖伊阿说，美国最重要的事情是帮助促成一个对非洲领地特别是北非的共同看法；还说美国应当进行努力以便在对阿拉伯国家的政策方面取得共同态度；又说美国应当向全世界表明它承认阿尔及利亚问题是法国的事情，不应当干涉。人们从这些话里面，可以听出对华盛顿的满腹牢骚。然而，盖伊阿在说了这些之后，忽然转了一个一百八十度的大弯，说他认为美国应当如何如何，事实上也就是美国政府的意见。
    人们不禁要问：既然盖伊阿认为这就是美国政府的意见，那末他为什么还要多费这些口舌呢？他那些话又是讲给谁听的呢？
    明明是自己在中东、北非的殖民利益受到觊觎和侵夺，禁不住要抱怨几句；然而又怕得罪美国，不得不打一个自相矛盾的圆场。作了一个可怜的次等伙伴，连发牢骚的自由都被剥夺，何其可怜也。
