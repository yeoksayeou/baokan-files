    Reading "Notes from Prison"
    Jiang Zhi Shui
    I greedily finished reading the recently discovered posthumous work of Martyr Fang Zhimin, "Notes from Prison," and I was deeply moved by it.
    In addition to exposing the dark life of the reactionary prison and the brutality of the Kuomintang, what left the deepest impression on me was Comrade Fang Zhimin's loyalty and confidence in the proletarian revolution, and his deep hope and love for the motherland and the people. After Comrade Zhimin was captured, he did not give up the slightest struggle in prison. He told his comrades to prepare the revolutionary slogans to shout before their execution; he even wanted to plan a prison break under extremely difficult circumstances; he never missed an opportunity to conduct propaganda and education for the lower-ranking soldiers of the Kuomintang. He showed such integrity in front of the enemy, full of class hatred. He wrote similar words on many occasions: "The enemy can only cut off our heads, but can never shake our beliefs!"
    In order to report to the Party Central Committee and introduce the successes and failures of the work to the comrades in the base areas, Comrade Fang Zhimin wrote more than one manuscript full of revolutionary spirit in prison. He said to the enemy that he wanted to write an account of the Red Army's revolutionary struggle and the details of the Gan-northeast Soviet area. The enemy was "so happy that they quickly ordered the detention center to provide tables, chairs, pens, ink, and manuscripts. They hoped to get some 'bandit suppression' (?) materials from this, so as to more fiercely devastate the Soviet area. In fact, I took advantage of this opportunity to write and preserve a number of manuscripts to expose the Kuomintang's conspiracy." During that hot season, he "sweated like rain, holding a pen, writing while conceiving, and at the same time guarding against the enemy entering the room." The six articles included in "Notes from Prison," such as "Death" and "Letter to a Certain Couple," were written and preserved in this way. While reading, I strongly felt Comrade Zhimin's serious and ardent longing for the Party Central Committee and all Party comrades. As an outstanding communist fighter, Comrade Fang Zhimin was thinking about the revolution and the Party at all times.
    This is a book that narrates facts with a "very honest writing attitude" and without "ostentation and exaggeration," but it is also a moving work of literature. Who can read "Historical Preface to the Founding of the Gan-northeast Soviet" and "Our Words Before Death" without being stirred by the magnificent text? And "Death!" and "Remembering the Deaths of Comrades Hu Hai, Lou Mengxia, and Xie Mingren" are even more novels and essays full of emotion and blood and tears. I will never forget the description of the scene when the deputy director of the military law office interrogated the martyr in "Death!". One side is the image of a solemn revolutionary; the other is a "dog" that makes people hate from the bottom of their hearts! Comrade Zhimin portrayed this schemer who came to persuade him to surrender very vividly and meticulously. He was truly a seasoned and cunning Kuomintang member. Comrade Fang Zhimin used his pen, filled with contempt and anger, to outline the enemy's insidiousness and shamelessness. We held our breath and did not breathe a sigh of relief until he ended the interrogation without gaining anything.
    "Remembering the Deaths of Comrades Hu Hai, Lou Mengxia, and Xie Mingren" is a very concise essay. On the day of the old lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival, someone sent some dishes to the martyrs, and the martyrs also invited Comrade Lou Mengxia, who was arrested and imprisoned for working in the Security Bureau, to gather together. Several Party cadres fighting fell into the enemy's prison to eat Dragon Boat Festival rice. A deep sense of sadness arose in Comrade Zhimin's heart. They tore off a chicken leg and politely offered it to each other. Comrade Lou Mengxia handed it to the comrades who were sick and injured. Comrade Zhimin gave it to Comrade Lou Mengxia to eat. He wrote: "I know that the enemy will kill without mercy the comrades who work in our Security Bureau. The piece of chicken that I sent to him is probably the last time." How noble and moving this close class feeling between comrades is!
    Early on the third day, Lou Mengxia (Director of the Security Bureau of Jiangxi Province), that strong young man with a smiling face, was indeed shot! Immediately afterwards, the land minister of the Soviet Central Government, Hu Hai, who was from a peasant background, and Xie Mingren, the secretary of the Xingguo County Party Committee, were also shot the next day! They were unyielding in the face of disaster and died heroically. Comrade Fang Zhimin used his pen with deep mourning and anger to write down the bloodshed of these revolutionaries for us!
    The pseudo-military law office deputy director in "Death!" once confidently and triumphantly said to the martyr: "Your doctrine will not succeed, and even if it does succeed, it will probably take five hundred years." His arrogant prediction was too casual, and history has proved that it has long gone bankrupt. In fact, even at the time, these words would not shake the will of a true revolutionary in the slightest. However, we should understand today how hard-won the success of this doctrine is, and how many comrades' blood has been shed on the red flag of this doctrine. "I am very willing to shed blood for the Party and the Soviet. The day of bloodshed will always come." Finally, Martyr Fang Zhimin also dedicated his blood to our cause.
    I enthusiastically recommend it to readers, how much we need these books full of proletarian revolutionary spirit!

### 读“狱中纪实”

    读“狱中纪实”
    江之水
    我贪婪地读完新近发现的方志敏烈士的遗著“狱中纪实”，我深深地为它感动了。
    书中除了暴露反动监狱的阴暗生活，和国民党的残暴以外，留给我印象最深的还是方志敏同志对于无产阶级革命的忠诚和信心，对于祖国和人民的深沉的希望和爱。志敏同志被俘以后，在狱中也不放弃丝毫的斗争，他告诉同伴们准备好就义前喊的革命口号；在极端困难的环境下还想筹划越狱；对于国民党的下级士兵，也从不放过宣传教育的机会。在敌人面前他表现得那么有气节，充满了阶级的仇恨。他在好多场合写到类似的话：“敌人只能砍下我们的头颅，决不能动摇我们的信仰！”
    为了向党中央汇报和向根据地的工作同志们介绍工作的成功和失败的教训，方志敏同志在狱中写下了不止一篇充满了革命精神的文稿。他向敌人说，要写一篇红军革命斗争的经过与赣东北苏区的详情，敌人听了“乐得什么似的，赶快令看守所供给桌椅笔墨和稿本。他们满望从此得到一点‘剿匪’（？）材料，以便更凶恶地来摧残苏区。实在，我却利用这个机会，写成了好些文稿保藏着，以揭露国民党的阴谋。”就在那个炎暑的季节里，他“汗流如雨，手执着笔，一面构思在写，一面却要防备敌人进房来”。包括在“狱中纪实”里的“死”、“给某夫妇的信”等六篇文章，就是这样写成并保存了下来的。读书时，我强烈地感触到志敏同志这种严肃、热烈地向往党中央和全党同志的心情，作为一个卓越的共产主义战士的方志敏同志，他是无时无刻不想着革命，想着党的。
    这是一部“写作态度十分诚实”，毫无“铺扬和夸耀”的叙述事实的书，但，也是一部动人的文学作品。像“赣东北苏维埃创立的历史序言”和“我们临死以前的话”，谁读了能不会为那大气磅礴的文字而被鼓动了呢？而“死！”、“记胡海、娄梦侠、谢名仁三同志的死”更是充满了感情，充满了血泪的小说和散文。我难忘在“死！”中，那个军法处副处长审讯烈士时的那场描写。一面是庄严的革命者的形象；一面则是看了令人从内心憎恶的“狗”！志敏同志把这个来劝降的阴谋家描绘得十分形象、细致，那真是一个老练而狡猾的国民党，方志敏同志用他带着轻蔑和愠怒的笔，给我们勾画出了敌人的阴险和无耻，我们是屏着气，一直读到他毫无所得的结束了那场审讯以后才松了一口气的。
    “记胡海、娄梦侠、谢名仁三同志的死”是一篇十分简炼的散文。旧历端午节的一天，有人给烈士们送来几样菜，烈士们把被捕入狱的作保卫局工作的娄梦侠同志，也找来聚会。几个党的斗争干部，落在敌人牢狱中，吃端午饭，志敏同志的心里发生了一种深沉的伤感。撕下一只鸡腿也彼此谦让着，娄梦侠同志把它递到病中和负伤的同志的碗中，志敏同志却给娄梦侠同志吃，他写道：“我知道，敌人对于我们做保卫局工作的同志，是杀无赦的。经我手送给他的一块鸡，怕算是最后的一次了。”这种同志间亲密的阶级感情是多么崇高，多么令人感动！
    第三天的绝早，那个面带着笑容的强壮的青年——娄梦侠（江西省保卫局长），果然被枪杀了！紧接着，在第二天，农民出身的苏维埃中央政府的土地部长胡海同志和兴国县委书记谢名仁同志也被枪杀了！他们临难不屈，悲壮就义，方志敏同志又用他那带着深深的哀悼和愤怒的笔，为我们写下了这几个革命者的流血！
    “死！”中的那位伪军法处副处长，曾经自信而得意地跟烈士说：“你们的主义，是不得成功的，就是要成功，恐怕也还得五百年。”他的这个狂妄的预言说得过于随便了，历史证明它早已完全破产。其实，即或在当时这些话也丝毫不会动摇一个真正革命者的意志。只是，我们今天应该明白，这主义的成功，得来的是多么不易，不知有多少同志的血就洒在了这主义的红旗上。“为党为苏维埃流血，这是我十分情愿的。流血的一天，总是要来的。”最后，方志敏烈士也以他的鲜血献给了我们的事业。
    我热诚地向读者推荐它，我们多么需要这些充满了无产阶级革命精神的书啊！
