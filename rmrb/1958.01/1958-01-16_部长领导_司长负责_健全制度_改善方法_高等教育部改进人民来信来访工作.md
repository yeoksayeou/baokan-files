    Ministerial Leadership, Department Director Responsibility, Sound Systems, Improved Methods:
    Ministry of Higher Education Improves Work on People's Letters and Visits
    (Our dispatch) Beijing – Recently, the Ministry of Higher Education conducted a key inspection of the work of handling people's letters and visits during the rectification campaign, and in response to the existing problems, adopted specific measures to strengthen and improve this work.

    Minister Yang Xiufeng and Vice-Minister Liu Zizai, who is in charge of the work related to people's letters, both instructed all departments within the ministry to vigorously improve the work on people's letters and visits in conjunction with the rectification campaign, and focused on inspecting the problems existing in the Department of Secondary Specialized Education's handling of people's letters. The results of the inspection showed that individual units in the Ministry of Higher Education still had serious shortcomings in handling people's letters.

    During the inspection of 1,309 letters received by the Department of Secondary Specialized Education over four months, 404 were backlogged and not processed; among the 863 letters that had been processed, 663 were forwarded to relevant departments or filed, and only 200 were directly answered. Among the letters that had been processed, 207 had been delayed for more than a month. In addition, the whereabouts of 71 letters could not be found (42 of which had not been processed). The serious delays caused dissatisfaction among the letter writers and increased the number of repeat letters. The practice of simply copying and forwarding letters resulted in letters being forwarded that should not have been, and the original letters were returned by several departments due to incorrect forwarding. Due to carelessness and lax review, the content of the replies was incomplete, unsatisfactory, and even irrelevant or incoherent in many cases. In order to educate cadres, the Ministry of Higher Education has exposed the shortcomings and errors found in the inspection on big-character posters, and the Department of Secondary Specialized Education, which was inspected, held a small exhibition of letters with shortcomings and errors in processing within the department.

    In order to overcome bureaucracy and further strengthen and improve the work on people's letters, in addition to arranging for all departments to conduct inspections, listen to reports, and give instructions on how to do a good job in handling people's letters in the future, the Ministry of Higher Education also participated in the research and decision-making on improvement measures.

    The first is to strengthen leadership over the work on people's letters and visits. In addition to a vice-minister leading the ministry's work on people's letters and visits, each department has a director or deputy director responsible for the work on people's letters and visits in their respective units. Letters involving principles and policies, as well as important criticisms and suggestions, will be handled and signed by the minister, vice-ministers, directors, or deputy directors, depending on the circumstances. Putting the work on people's letters on the agenda of the ministerial office meetings and departmental affairs meetings, and studying the work on people's letters once every three months and half a year.

    Secondly, changing the method of handling people's letters. The characteristic of the Ministry of Higher Education's people's letters is that the quantity is large, but most of them are general inquiries. In the past, these letters were handled by the respective competent departments. Facts have proved that this method of handling not only increases the operation process and is very easy to cause backlog, but also is not necessary to combine with business processing. Therefore, in the future, except for letters involving principles and policies, regulations and systems, and more important criticisms and suggestions, which will still be handled by the respective competent departments, all general inquiries will be handled centrally by the People's Letters and Visits Office.

    Third, improving the system of handling people's letters. Expediting and inspecting the handling of people's letters, expediting once a week and once a month, depending on the importance and urgency, and conducting an inspection every quarter. Completing the registration and circulation procedures for letters and unifying the receipt and dispatch of letters, etc., in order to eliminate or reduce the chaotic phenomena such as delays, backlogs, and lost letters caused by imperfect systems.

    Fourth, strengthening comprehensive research. Timely classify and conduct comprehensive research on letters related to criticisms and suggestions on the implementation of principles and policies and letters with general problems, and write written materials for the leadership to understand the problems in the work and consider improving work and publicity and education.

    Fifth, in conjunction with the current streamlining of institutions and decentralization of cadres, the Ministry of Higher Education has decided to conduct a thorough review of the people's letters of the past year, promptly handle the backlogged and unprocessed letters, uniformly answer the questions that can be answered publicly in the newspapers, and organize and file the letters that should be archived.

    In addition, the Ministry of Higher Education has formed a temporary planning group for people's letters to conduct a comprehensive study and planning on how to do a good job in handling people's letters. Judging from the current situation, the speed and quality of the Ministry of Higher Education's handling of people's letters have been improved. (Wang Jingyu)

    部长领导　司长负责　健全制度　改善方法
    高等教育部改进人民来信来访工作
    本报讯　最近，高等教育部在整改中对人民来信和接待人民来访工作进行了重点检查，并针对存在的问题，采取了加强和改进这一工作的具体措施。
    杨秀峰部长和主管人民来信工作的刘子载副部长都指示部内各司结合整改大力改进人民来信来访工作，并重点检查了中等专业教育司处理人民来信工作中存在的问题。检查的结果表明，高等教育部个别单位在处理人民来信工作中还存在着严重的缺点。
    在检查中等专业教育司四个月的一千三百零九件来信中，积压未处理的四百零四件；在已处理的八百六十三件来信中，转有关部门和存查的六百六十三件，直接答复的只有二百件。在已处理的来信中，拖到一个月以上处理的达二百零七件。另外还有七十一件信查不到下落（其中未处理的四十二件）。由于严重的拖拉，引起了来信人的不满和重复来信的增加。照抄照转的结果使不该转的信也转出去了，因转错而被几个部门把原信退回。由于粗心大意和审查不严，复信内容不全面，不完满，甚至答非所问、文理不通的例子也很不少。为了教育干部，高等教育部已把检查中发现的缺点和错误在大字报上揭露，被检查的中等专业教育司，并把处理上有缺点和错误的信件，在司内举办了小型展览会。
    为了克服官僚主义，进一步加强和改进人民来信工作，高等教育部除了布置各司检查、听取汇报和对今后如何做好人民来信工作作了指示外，并参予研究和决定了改进措施。
    首先是加强对人民来信来访工作的领导，除了有一位副部长领导部的人民来信来访工作外，各司均有一位司长或副司长负责本单位的人民来信来访工作。对于涉及到方针政策及重要批评建议的来信，将分别情况由正副部长或正副司长批办和签发。把人民来信工作列为部长办公会议和司务会议的一项内容，每三个月和半年研究一次人民来信工作。
    其次，改变处理人民来信的方法。高等教育部人民来信的特点是，数量大，但大部分属于一般询问，过去这类来信是分由各主管司处理。事实证明，这样处理不但增加了运转过程极易造成积压，而且也无必要结合业务处理。因此，今后除涉及方针政策及规章制度等较为重要的批评建议的来信仍由各主管司处理外，凡属一般询问的来信均集中于人民来信来访办公室处理。
    第三，健全人民来信工作制度。对人民来信处理情况催办检查，分别轻重缓急每周和一个月进行一次催办，每季进行一次检查。完备信件的登记运转手续及收发信件统一归口等等，以消灭或减少因制度不健全而产生的拖拉积压和丢失信件等混乱现象。
    第四，加强综合研究。把有关对执行方针政策的批评建议和带有普遍性问题的来信，及时的分类进行综合研究，写出书面材料，以供领导上了解工作中的问题，考虑改进工作和宣传教育的参考。
    第五，结合目前精简机构、下放干部，高等教育部已决定把一年来的人民来信进行一次彻底的清理，积压未处理的来信迅速处理，可以公开答复的问题，在报纸上统一答复。应该归档的整理归档。
    此外，高等教育部组成了人民来信临时规划小组，就如何作好人民来信工作进行全面的研究、规划。就目前情况看来，高等教育部在处理人民来信的速度和质量上已经有所提高。（王敬禹）
