Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: Materials cited by Belov, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, in an article recently published in the "Soviet Russia" newspaper, show that the Soviet Union's industrial development rate in 1957 was approximately nine times faster than that of the United States. The article stated that the Soviet Union's total industrial output increased by 10% in 1957, while according to estimates by the "Standard & Poor's Corporation" Market Statistics Bureau, the United States' total industrial output only increased by approximately 1% last year.

Belov pointed out that, according to the national plan, the Soviet Union's industrial growth rate in 1958 will be faster than the original development target for last year. Last year, Soviet industrial production was originally planned to increase by 7.1%, and this year it will increase by 7.6%.

He said that the main task of the Soviet national economic development this year is to greatly accelerate the chemical industry, especially the production of plastics, artificial fibers, and artificial leather. At the same time, special attention will also be paid to the development of the oil and oil processing industry, the gas industry, and the metallurgical industry, especially the metallurgical raw material base. To this end, the maximum manpower, material resources, and funds will be concentrated this year to develop these industrial sectors.

Belov said that in order to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, the total amount of basic investment in the Soviet chemical industry in 1958 will increase to 1.5 times that of last year. Among them, the basic investment used to build plastics factories will increase to 2.5 times, and the basic investment used to build artificial fiber factories will increase to 1.8 times.

This year, the basic investment used to develop the oil and gas industry will be nearly 4 billion rubles, which is more than 30% higher than last year. In this year, the total amount of Soviet oil extraction will increase by 14%. The area with the largest increase in production will be the "Second Baku" oil region between the Urals and the Volga River basin. This year, the proportion of oil extraction in this oil region in the total national oil output will increase from 70% last year to 84%. In terms of the gas industry, this year's gas extraction volume will increase by approximately 11 billion cubic meters.

Belov pointed out that this year the Soviet Union will take major measures to accelerate the construction of metallurgical plants and the expansion and renovation of mining enterprises. This year, a total of seven giant blast furnaces, seven rolling mills, and mining enterprises that can mine a total of 10 million tons of iron ore per year will be completed. The putting into production of new production capacity and the improvement of labor productivity in existing enterprises will enable the Soviet Union's pig iron output to increase to 39.1 million tons this year, steel output to reach 53.6 million tons, and steel product output to reach 41.7 million tons.

The output of the Soviet machine-building industry will increase by 11% this year. A series of measures will be taken to strengthen the specialization of machine-building factories in various regions and to improve their degree of production automation.

Belov also pointed out that the long-term plan formulated by the Soviet Communist Party and the government to ensure that residents' demand for consumer goods is fully met in the next five to seven years has now begun to be implemented. This year, the Soviet Union will greatly increase the production of textiles and leather shoes, and the output of sugar, meat, fats and oils, and dairy products will increase particularly rapidly. The consumer goods industrial enterprises to be built this year include: a batch of textile factories with a total of 224,000 spindles and more than 8,000 looms, as well as 45 milk and oil processing factories, etc.

    在和平经济竞赛中阔步向前
    苏联去年工业发展速度比美国快九倍
    今年增长速度会更快　石油钢铁产量将激增
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联国家计划委员会副主席别洛夫最近在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”发表的一篇文章中所引证的材料表明，1957年苏联工业的发展速度比美国大约快九倍。这篇文章说，1957年苏联工业的总产量增加了10％，而据美国“史坦德普尔公司”行情统计局的估计，去年美国工业总产量只大约增加了1％。
    别洛夫指出，根据国家计划，1958年苏联工业的增长速度将快于原定的去年发展指标。去年，苏联工业生产原计划增加7.1％，今年将增加7.6％。
    他说，今年苏联国民经济发展的主要任务是大大加快化学工业，特别是塑料、人造纤维和人造皮革的生产。同时，还将特别注意石油和石油加工工业、煤气和冶金工业，首先是冶金原料基地的发展。为此，今年将集中最大限度的人力、物力和资金来发展这些工业部门。
    别洛夫说，为了加速发展化学工业，1958年对苏联化学工业的基本投资总额将增加为去年的一点五倍。其中用来建设塑料工厂的基本投资将增加为二点五倍、建设人造纤维工厂的基本投资将增加为一点八倍。
    今年，用来发展石油和煤气工业的基本投资将近四十亿卢布，即比去年增加30％以上。在这一年，苏联石油总开采量将增加14％，增产最多的将是乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域之间的“第二巴库”油区，今年这个油区的石油开采量在全国石油总产量中所占的比重将由去年的70％提高到84％。在煤气工业方面，今年的煤气开采量将增加约一百一十亿立方公尺。
    别洛夫指出，今年苏联将采取重大的措施来加速冶金工厂的建设以及采矿企业的扩建和改建。今年总共将建成七个巨型高炉、七个轧钢机和每年总共可以开采一千万吨铁矿砂的采矿企业。新的生产能力的投入生产和现有企业劳动生产率的提高，将使今年苏联的生铁产量增加到三千九百一十万吨、钢产量达五千三百六十万吨、钢材产量达四千一百七十万吨。
    苏联机器制造工业的产量今年将增加11％。将采取一系列措施来加强各地机器制造厂的专业化，并且提高它们的生产自动化程度。
    别洛夫还指出，苏联共产党和政府制定的保证在最近五年到七年内充分满足居民对消费品的需求的长远计划，现在已经开始执行。今年，苏联将大大增加纺织品和皮鞋的生产，砂糖、肉类、油脂和奶制品的产量将增加得特别快。将在今年建成的消费品工业企业包括：一批总共有二十二万四千纱锭、八千多台织机的纺织厂，以及四十五座牛奶和油脂加工工厂等。
