    Intercropping Coarse Grains, Using Short-Term Gains to Support Long-Term Development, Developing Forestry
    XinChong Township's Afforestation Closely Integrates with the Current Interests of the Masses
    (Based on a report from the Fujian Daily) Fujian Yong'an County, Gongchuan District, XinChong Township, has accumulated valuable experience in developing forestry by intercropping coarse grains in forest land, creating a method of "using short-term gains to support long-term development."
    Over the past five years, XinChong Township has continuously expanded intercropping in forest land, which has first and foremost significantly increased the income of commune members. For example, Chong Er Cooperative afforested more than 300 mu from 1953 to 1955, and the actual income from intercropping coarse grains and oil crops reached 364.8 yuan. The total expenditure for afforestation and intercropping in these three years was 266 workdays, with an average income of 1.37 yuan per workday. Since last year, the tung trees intercropped in the forest land have begun to bear fruit, and in the next five or six years, the income will increase by an average of 40 to 50 yuan per year. According to statistics from nine cooperatives, the income from intercropping cassava, sweet potatoes, and canna edulis in forest land last year alone amounted to more than 12,650 yuan, with an output value of approximately 400 to 500 jin of rice per mu in terms of grain; each household's income increased by an average of more than 36 yuan as a result. The commune members deeply realized that utilizing forest land for intercropping coarse grains not only yields quick returns but also provides high labor remuneration, playing a role of "using short-term gains to support long-term development and quenching immediate thirst."
    Second, intercropping in forest land resolves the contradiction between current and long-term interests, greatly encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation and promoting forestry production. Before the implementation of intercropping coarse grains in forest land in the spring of 1953, the entire township afforested only more than 250 mu, which did not even reach half of the district committee's requirements. After implementing this method of combining short-term and long-term production, the peasants received real benefits, and the afforestation plan was exceeded every year. Up to now, 85% of the suitable barren mountains have been eliminated, and more than 3,200 mu of Chinese fir and economic forests such as tung trees and oil tea trees have been cultivated, making it the township with the largest afforestation area in the entire district. The survival rate of forest seedlings has also reached over 80%, ranking first in the county. At the same time, according to the township's inspection of the afforestation situation in the past few years, it was found that the Chinese fir trees that were intercropped with tung trees and coarse grains grew well. Experienced forest farmers said that they will mature four years earlier than Chinese fir trees that have not been intercropped with crops. While afforesting, the township has also done a good job in forest protection and fire prevention, maintaining its title of a disaster-free township since liberation.
    Third, intercropping coarse grains in forest land also provides a large amount of feed for pig raising. For example, each household in Chong Er Cooperative now raises an average of nearly two pigs, half of the feed comes from intercropped coarse grain crops such as sweet potatoes, cassava, and canna edulis in forest land. Now, the number of pigs raised in the entire township has increased from an average of half a pig per household in the past to 1.6 pigs. With more pigs, there is also more fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland has increased year by year, and increased grain production is guaranteed.

    间作杂粮  以短养长  发展林业
    新冲乡造林同当前群众利益密切结合
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：福建永安县贡川区新冲乡在林地间作杂粮，创造了“以短养长”发展林业的宝贵经验。
    五年来，新冲乡不断扩大林地间作，首先使社员的收入大大增加。如冲二社从1953年至1955年共造林三百多亩，间作杂粮和油料作物的实收入达三百六十四元八角。这三年造林和间作一共花了二百六十六个工，每工平均收入达一元三角七分。从去年起林地间作的油桐已开始结果，往后五、六年内平均每年还能增加收入四、五十元。据九个社的统计，去年仅林地间作的木薯、番薯、芭蕉芋三项收益就有一万二千六百五十多元，每亩产值以粮食计，约合稻谷四、五百斤；每户因此平均增加收入三十六元多。社员们深深体会到利用林地间作杂粮，不仅收益快，而且劳动报酬高，起了“以短养长，近水解渴”的作用。
    第二、林地间作解决了目前利益和长远利益的矛盾，大大鼓舞了群众造林积极性，促进了林业生产。在没有推行林地间作杂粮以前的1953年春天，全乡只造林二百五十多亩，还达不到区委要求的一半；而推行这种长短期生产相结合的办法以后，农民得到现实利益，造林计划年年突破，到现在，已经消灭了占总数85％的宜林荒山，营造杉木和油桐、油茶等经济林三千二百多亩，成为全区造林面积最多的一个乡，而林苗成活率也达80％以上，居全县首位。同时，据乡里检查了以往几年来的造林情况，发现凡是间作油桐和杂粮的杉木都生长良好，据有经验的林农说，将比没有间作过作物的杉木能提早四年成材。在造林的同时，该乡护林防火工作也做得很好，解放以来，一直保持着无灾乡的称号。
    第三、林地间作杂粮，也为养猪提供了大量的饲料。如冲二社现在每户平均养猪近两头，其中一半饲料就是从林地套种的番薯、木薯、芭蕉芋等杂粮作物中得来的。现在，全乡养猪数量已从过去平均每户半头增加到一点六头。养猪多了，肥料也多，农田施肥量逐年增加，粮食增产就有了保证。
