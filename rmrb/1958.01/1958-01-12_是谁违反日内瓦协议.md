	Who is Violating the Geneva Agreement
	By Our Staff Commentator
	Recently, "an official" of the U.S. State Department stated that the United States seems to have implemented the agreement reached at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks regarding the repatriation of civilians from both sides, and all Chinese nationals who wish to return to China "have been allowed to leave the United States." At the same time, this official even said that China "has not complied with the Geneva Accords" because China "still holds six Americans in prison."
	This is complete nonsense. Everyone knows that the Chinese government has adopted a problem-solving attitude from the very beginning regarding the issue of repatriation of civilians between China and the United States, and has conscientiously implemented the agreement since the Geneva Accords were reached. All general American nationals in China can leave the country at any time, and the Chinese government provides them with various forms of assistance. Even the U.S. government cannot deny this point. As for the American prisoners in China, they do exist, but this is clearly a separate issue. These American prisoners have violated Chinese laws and must be sanctioned by Chinese law; their handling must follow Chinese legal procedures. The U.S. State Department should know that the era in which Americans could commit crimes in China with impunity has long passed, and the United States has no right to interfere in China's laws and sovereignty.
	Moreover, even for these American prisoners who have violated the law in China, the Chinese government has repeatedly taken lenient measures based on the nature of their crimes and their performance during their imprisonment, and has successively released them early. As a result, to date, only six of the original forty American criminals remain. At the same time, out of humanitarian considerations, the Chinese government expressed its agreement as early as January 1955 to allow the direct relatives of these American prisoners to visit them in China. However, due to obstruction from the U.S. side, only three relatives of American prisoners have come to China so far.
	Therefore, the U.S. State Department has repeatedly tried to confuse the issue of American prisoners in China with the issue of repatriation of civilians between China and the United States, attempting to slander China and provoke the feelings of the people of China and the United States, which is extremely sinister.
	Who is violating the Geneva Accords? It is precisely the United States. From the very beginning, the United States has obstructed Chinese nationals from returning to China. After the Geneva Accords were reached, the United States still did not change this policy. On the contrary, in order to prevent Chinese nationals from returning to China, the U.S. government has exhausted all kinds of difficulties, threats, and persecution. To cite a recent example, the experience of Zeng Guangzhi, a Chinese student who returned from the United States last autumn, is one such case. Zeng Guangzhi was originally studying at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana. In the spring of 1956, when the U.S. Immigration Bureau learned that he wanted to return to China, they sent him to a mental hospital, locked him in a room like a prisoner, restricted his freedom to communicate with his family, and even put him in handcuffs. In this way, Zeng Guangzhi was tortured for fourteen months before being "deported." This is what the official of the U.S. State Department refers to as Chinese nationals being "allowed to leave the United States"!
	However, there are still many Chinese nationals like Zeng Guangzhi who eagerly hope to return to their motherland but are still being detained by the United States. In recent years, government agencies and newspapers in our country have received a large number of letters from family members of Chinese nationals, who have called on the U.S. government to "return my loved ones"! At the same time, letters from many Chinese nationals to their families have also proven that, although they are eager to return to China "with hearts burning with anxiety," they are subjected to all kinds of obstruction from the U.S. side. These facts cannot be denied by the U.S. government no matter what. The U.S. government itself violates the Geneva Accords but instead attempts to bite China back, which is doubly shameless.
	We believe that the Geneva Accords must be earnestly implemented. The U.S. obstruction of Chinese nationals seeking to return home is not only contrary to the agreement but also contrary to humanitarian principles. The U.S. obstruction of Chinese nationals seeking to return home must be stopped immediately.

    是谁违反日内瓦协议
    本报评论员
    最近美国国务院的“一位官员”声明说，美国似乎已经执行了中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议，所有希望回国的中国侨民“都已获准离开美国”。同时，这个官员竟说中国“没有遵守日内瓦协议”，因为中国把“六名美国人仍然关在牢中”。
    这完全是胡说八道。谁都知道，中国政府对于中美双方平民回国问题一开始就采取解决问题的态度，并且在日内瓦协议达成以后认真地执行了协议。所有在中国的一般美国侨民都可以随时离境，中国政府并且给予他们种种协助。关于这一点就是美国政府也不能不承认。至于在中国的美国犯人，的确是有的，但这明明是另外一个问题。这些美国犯人违犯了中国的法律，就必须受中国法律的制裁，对于他们的处理必须按照中国的法律程序。美国国务院总该知道，美国人在中国犯了罪可以逍遥法外的时代早已过去了，美国根本无权干涉中国的法律和主权。
    而且，就是对于这些在中国犯了法的美国犯人，中国政府也是根据他们的罪状和在服刑期间的表现，一再采取了宽大措施，陆续地提前予以释放。因此，到今天为止，原有的四十名美国罪犯，只剩下六人。同时，中国政府出于人道的考虑，早在1955年1月就表示同意让这些美国犯人的直系亲属来华探亲。只是由于美国方面的阻挠，到现在才有三名美国犯人的亲属到中国来。
    因此，美国国务院一再把在中国的美国犯人问题同中美双方平民回国问题硬搅在一起，企图诬蔑中国，并挑拨中美两国人民的感情，居心是极为险恶的。
    违反日内瓦协议的是谁？恰恰就是美国。美国方面从一开头就阻挠中国侨民回国。在日内瓦协议达成以后，美国仍然没有改变这种政策。相反地，为了阻止中国侨民回国，美国政府用尽了种种刁难、威胁、迫害的手段。远的不说，去年秋天从美国归来的中国留学生曾广植的遭遇就是一个例子。曾广植原在美国印第安纳州拉斐德城的帕都大学读书。1956年春，当美国移民局知道他想回国以后，竟把他送进精神病院，像囚犯一样地被锁在一间房子里，限制他和家庭通信的自由，甚至给他戴上了手铐。就这样，曾广植被折磨了十四个月之久，才被“驱逐出境”。这就是美国国务院的那位官员所说的中国侨民“获准离开美国”！
    可是，还有许多像曾广植这样热望返回祖国的中国侨民，至今仍被美国扣留着。近年来我国政府机关和各报刊接到了大批中国侨民家属的来信，他们纷纷要求美国政府“还我亲人”！同时，从许多中国侨民给他们的家属的信件中，也证明了，他们虽然渴望回国“心急如烧”，但是却受到美国方面的百般阻挠。这些事实是美国政府无论如何也抹煞不了的。美国政府自己违反日内瓦协议，却反而企图向中国倒咬一口，这是双倍的无耻。
    我们认为，日内瓦协议必须切实执行，美国方面阻挠要求返国的中国侨民的行为，不仅有悖于协议，而且有悖于人道原则。美国对于要求回国的中国侨民的阻难必须立即停止。
