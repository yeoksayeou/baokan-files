    Establishing Industrial "Experimental Fields"
    Kong Sang
    Leading comrades at all levels in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, through the demonstrative role of cultivating experimental fields, promoted advanced agricultural technologies, enabling the county's agriculture to achieve an unprecedented and comprehensive bumper harvest. Leading comrades of the Dong Mine at the Heshan Coal Mine in Guangxi, through cadre workfaces – industrial "experimental fields" – rapidly resolved problems that had remained unsolved for a long time, greatly promoting the development of production. These two events show that running "experimental fields" is a very good leadership method. It is applicable to the grassroots, applicable to leaders at all levels, and applicable to all walks of life, and it is worth promoting.
    When we do anything, from setting guidelines and policies to proposing a specific measure, we must conform to the laws of the development of objective things, otherwise we will commit subjectivist errors. However, because people's understanding of objective things is restricted by many conditions, the thought lags behind the reality, or, in other words, the subjective guiding ideology does not conform to the objective reality and is not correct, things often go wrong. Our socialist construction requires mobilizing millions of people to complete, and any mistake will cause economic losses or politically dampen the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The responsibility of a leader is to try to overcome or reduce the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality, and to try to avoid making mistakes, or to reduce the scope of making mistakes. How can we overcome and reduce the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality? The only way is to constantly delve into reality.
    There are many ways to delve into reality, including non-fixedly delving into a basic unit for investigation, holding symposiums, and running "experimental fields," etc. Running "experimental fields" is a better method. By running "experimental fields," leading cadres can quickly become familiar with and master production technologies and business, understand the difficulties in the work, and find ways to overcome the difficulties. Moreover, because these methods come from practice, from the most basic level, they have a demonstrative effect on the broad masses, can most effectively overcome various conservative ideas, and rapidly promote the development of production. The process from experimentation to demonstration (promotion) is the process of coming from practice and then being taken to practice for testing, and it is also the process of combining individual leadership with general appeals. With this constant practice and constant combination, our understanding of objective things will become more comprehensive each time, and the guidelines, policies, and measures we propose will be more correct each time, thus more forcefully promoting the development of production and work.
    Running "experimental fields" is not simply a matter of leadership methods, but more importantly, it improves cadres' ability to manage their work. Many comrades who are now leading economic work are "newcomers" who have relatively rich experience in political and ideological work, but do not know much about business and technology. If comrades who do leadership work do not understand production technology, when they talk about production with the masses, they will be like the comrades of Heshan Coal Mine said: "Lack of a common language." In this case, it is difficult for them to specifically lead the development of production.
    How can we quickly learn technology and business? The best way is to run "experimental fields" and learn in actual production. To transform oneself from a layman into an expert.
    Now, the broad masses of workers have actively acted, trying every means to tap potential, think of ways, and strive for a great leap forward in production and construction this year. But at this time, some leading comrades do not delve into reality, but sit in the office and repeatedly talk about: "What is the sign of this industrial production upsurge?" "Is the term 'Great Leap Forward' appropriate?..." They stand outside the fiery production movement, commenting and worrying. For these comrades, we especially hope that they will step out of the office and go to the grassroots to run an "experimental field."

    建立工业的“试验田”
    孔桑
    湖北红安县各级领导同志，通过培育试验田的示范作用，推广先进的农业技术，使全县农业获得空前的全面大丰收。广西合山煤矿东矿场的领导同志，通过干部工作面——工业上的“试验田”，迅速地解决了过去长期不能解决的问题，大大推动了生产的发展。这两件事情说明，搞“试验田”是一个很好的领导方法。它适用于基层，适用于各级领导，适用于各行各业，值得提倡。
    我们办任何事情，大至定方针、定政策，小至提出一个具体措施，都要符合客观事物的发展规律，否则就会犯主观主义的错误。但是，因为人们对客观事物的认识受着许多条件的限制，所以思想落后于实际，或者叫做主观的指导思想与客观的实际情况不相符合，不对头的事是常有的。我们搞社会主义建设，是要动员千千万万群众去完成的，任何错误都会造成经济上的损失，或者在政治上挫伤群众的积极性和创造性。做领导的责任，就是尽量克服或缩小主观思想与客观实在的矛盾，尽量避免犯错误，或者缩小犯错误的范围。怎样才能克服和缩小主观思想与客观实际的矛盾呢？唯一的办法，是经常地深入实际。
    深入实际的方法是多种各样的，有不固定地深入某一个基层单位考察的，有召开座谈会的，有搞“试验田”的等等。搞“试验田”则是一个比较好的办法。通过搞“试验田”，领导干部可以很快地熟悉和掌握生产技术和业务，了解工作中的困难，找到克服困难的办法。而且，因为这些办法是从实践中来的，从最基层来的，所以对广大群众就有示范的作用，就能最有效地克服各种保守思想，迅速地促进生产的发展。从试验到示范（推广）的过程，就是从实践中来，再拿到实践中去考验的过程，也是把个别领导与一般号召相结合的过程。这样不断地实践、不断地结合，我们对客观事物的认识就一次比一次全面，提出的方针、政策、措施，就一次比一次正确，因而也就一次比一次更有力地促进生产和工作的发展。
    搞“试验田”，还不简单是一个领导方法问题，更重要的是提高干部管理业务的能力。现在有很多领导经济工作的同志，都是“半路出家”的，有比较丰富的政治工作和思想工作经验，但对业务和技术却知道得不多不深。如果做领导工作的同志不懂得生产技术，跟群众谈起生产来，就会像合山煤矿的同志所说的那样：“缺乏共同的语言”。在这种情况下，他们就难以去具体领导发展生产。
    怎样才能迅速地学会技术和业务呢？最好的办法就是搞“试验田”，在实际生产中学习。使自己从外行变成内行。
    现在，广大职工都已积极行动起来，千方百计地挖潜力，想办法，争取今年生产和建设的大跃进。但在这个时候，有的领导同志不深入实际，却坐在办公室里一次又一次地谈论：“这一次工业生产高潮的标志是什么呀？”“‘大跃进’的提法妥当不妥当呀！……”他们站在火热的生产运动外面，评头品足，忧虑重重。对于这些同志，特别希望他们走出办公室，到基层去搞一个“试验田”。
