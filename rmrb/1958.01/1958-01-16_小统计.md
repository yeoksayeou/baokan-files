    Small Statistics
    △ Currently, the average actual output of China's textile industry per minute is: 3,215 catties of cotton yarn, 28,555 feet of cotton cloth (of which 15,370 feet are printed and dyed), 22 catties of knitting wool, 99 feet of woolen fabric, and 792 feet of silk.
  △ The amount of cotton used by the Chinese people for padding is very large, exceeding 40% of the amount of cotton used for spinning. If everyone makes more use of old cotton batting and reduces the use of new cotton batting by one-tenth, then the cotton batting saved in one year could supply spinning mills to spin an additional 76.612 million catties of cotton yarn. This cotton yarn could be used to weave 848.8 million feet of cotton cloth, which could supply more than 60 million people with a set of clothes each.
  △ If each person in the country buys one more foot of cloth per year, it would require the operation of 7,992 modern looms or 68,588 wooden looms to weave the cloth. To weave this cloth, 210,000 spindles would first be needed to spin the yarn. To spin this cotton yarn, 61.75 million catties of cotton would be needed. To produce this cotton, 1.63 million mu of cotton fields would need to be planted.

    小统计
    △目前我国纺织工业平均在每一分钟里实际生产出：棉纱三千二百十五斤，棉布二万八千五百五十五尺（其中经过印花和染色的有一万五千三百七十尺），编织用的绒线二十二斤，呢绒九十九尺，绸缎七百九十二尺。
  △我国人民用来做絮棉的棉花，数字很大，比纺纱用棉花数量的十分之四还要多。如果大家多利用一下旧的棉絮，少用十分之一新的絮棉，那末，一年内省下来的絮棉，就可以供给纺纱厂多纺出七千六百十二万斤棉纱；用这些棉纱可以织成八亿四千八百万尺棉布；这些棉布可以供给六千多万人各做一套衣服。
  △全国人民每人每年多买一尺布，就得开动七千九百九十二台现代化的织布机或者六万八千五百八十八台木质织布机织布；织成这些布，先要用二十一万个纺纱锭纺纱；纺成这些棉纱，要用六千一百七十五万斤棉花；这些棉花，要用一百六十三万亩棉田种植出来。
