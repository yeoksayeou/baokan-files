Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th: Anhui Province held a swearing-in rally to eliminate the four pests on the 14th and established the Anhui Province Headquarters for Eliminating Four Pests, with Anhui Province Vice Governor Lu Xuebin as the commander-in-chief.

    Participating in this swearing-in rally were: secretaries of local Party committees, municipal committees, and county committees of the Chinese Communist Party, representatives of military regions, and representatives from agencies, factories, streets, schools, shops, agricultural cooperatives, mass organizations, etc., from Anhui Province and Hefei City, totaling more than 1,500 people.

    The First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, Zeng Xisheng, made an important instruction at the meeting. He said: Our work tasks are many, but they can be summarized into two: eliminating harm and promoting benefits. These two tasks are closely linked; eliminating harm inevitably brings benefits, and promoting benefits requires eliminating harm. We have eliminated much harm and promoted many benefits for the people in the past, but we must eliminate more harm and promote more benefits for the people. Now that the four pests are before us, we must be determined to eliminate them completely with the spirit of eradicating evil. On the basis of eliminating the four pests, we will further eliminate bedbugs, fleas, lice, midges, cockroaches, snails, etc.

    When talking about how to eliminate the four pests, Zeng Xisheng said that we must fully recognize the harm of the four pests and eliminate them like we eliminate class enemies. We must resolutely overcome the passivity in eliminating the four pests and turn passivity into initiative. For thousands of years, mosquitoes have bitten people, and rats and sparrows have rampaged and caused harm; people have always dealt with the four pests reactively, in a passive position. Why? Because the reactionary ruling classes in the past did not care about the suffering of the people, and the people suffered cruel exploitation and oppression from the ruling classes, their lives were very painful, and it was impossible for them to actively fight the four pests, let alone conceive of eliminating them. Now that the people have become the masters of the country, we must not let the four pests harm us anymore, and we must actively and thoroughly eliminate them. He said that passivity and initiative are two contradictory aspects; if you are not proactive, you will be passive, and to be proactive, you must get rid of passivity. We must turn to the opposite of passivity and take the initiative. Zeng Xisheng said that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and fully mobilize the masses. Party committees at all levels should actively lead this struggle, truly ensure that secretaries take action, Party members take the lead, and the whole people are mobilized, so that all men and women, young and old, in the province are engaged in the battle to wipe out the four pests, and comprehensively arrange the elimination of the four pests and other tasks.

    Zeng Xisheng emphasized that to eliminate the four pests, we must thoroughly criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, strengthen our revolutionary fighting spirit, pay attention to strategies and tactics in battle, summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner, carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests with the same drive as water conservancy construction, and make the movement to eliminate the four pests a regular activity.

    Lu Xuebin, the commander-in-chief of the Anhui Province Headquarters for Eliminating Four Pests, issued a general mobilization order to the people of the province at the meeting, calling on the people of the province to take immediate action and join the battle to eliminate the four pests.

    Fu Dazhang, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Anhui Province Headquarters for Eliminating Four Pests and commander-in-chief of Hefei City for Eliminating Four Pests, said at the meeting that he was confident of eliminating six pests, including rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, bedbugs, and cockroaches, in Hefei within two years.

    Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, 17th: Zhejiang Province's plan to eliminate the "four pests" in about seven years and strive to become a "four-without" province was officially passed on the 15th at the sixth meeting of the First People's Congress of Zhejiang Province as one of the six resolutions of the meeting.

    Zhejiang Province's plan to eliminate the "four pests" puts forward different requirements for urban and rural areas and areas with good or poor original sanitary environments: Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Jinhua and seven other cities, as well as Quzhou, Jiande, Linhai, Dinghai and other towns, should eliminate the "four pests" in advance within two to three years and achieve "four-without"; general towns and important transportation routes should achieve "four-without" within five years; at the same time, bedbugs, fleas, lice and cockroaches should be completely eliminated.

    At present, more than 50 cities and counties in the province have formulated long-term or crash plans to eliminate the "four pests." Hangzhou City has proposed to eliminate the "four pests" within two years, and provincial and municipal agencies have formulated action plans to basically eliminate the four pests within one year and completely eliminate the four pests within two years. In Jiaxing area, where schistosomiasis is more prevalent, while formulating plans to eliminate the four pests, it is required to actively eliminate snails, striving to achieve "five-without towns" in every county and "five-without villages" in every township this year; the whole area will create 67 "snail-free townships," 53 "mosquito- and fly-free towns," and two "fly- and mosquito-free" cities.

    Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 17th: Jiangsu Province plans to become a "four-without" province in eight years. This was announced at the first meeting convened on the 14th by the Patriotic Health Campaign Leading Group for Eliminating Four Pests, which was recently established by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This leading group consists of twelve comrades, with Chen Guang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as the leader, and Sun Jiano, Guan Wenwei, and He Binghao as deputy leaders.

    At the meeting of the leading group, it was decided to turn Jiangsu Province into a "four-without" province within eight years, and strive to achieve it ahead of schedule; it was required that from now until the Spring Festival, the province capture 25 million rats, catch 10 million sparrows, kill 2,000 catties of mosquitoes, kill 9,000 catties of flies, and accumulate 40 million dan of miscellaneous fertilizer.

    The meeting considered that the prevalence of schistosomiasis in Jiangsu Province is serious and decided to list the intermediate host of schistosomiasis—snails—as a pest to be eliminated along with the other four.

    The meeting also studied the publicity work for the Patriotic Health Campaign for Eliminating Four Pests and the establishment of leadership organizations at all levels, as well as specific office structures, etc., in order to better guide the movement forward.

    全民动员向四害发起歼灭战
    除害必然兴利　兴利必须除害
    安徽举行除四害誓师大会
    浙江江苏分别规划七、八年内成为“四无”省
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省在14日举行除四害誓师大会，并成立了安徽省除四害总指挥部，由安徽省副省长陆学斌任总指挥。
      参加这次誓师大会的有：中共各地地委、市委、县委的书记，军区代表，安徽省和合肥市的机关、工厂、街道、学校、商店、农业社、群众团体等代表共一千五百多人。
    中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣在会上作了重要指示。他说：我们的工作任务是很多的，但归纳起来是两个，一是除害，一是兴利。这两个任务是密切结合的，除害必然兴利，兴利必须除害。我们过去已经给人民除了许多害，兴了许多利，但是我们还要给人民除更多的害，兴更多的利。现在四害摆在我们面前，我们必须下定决心，拿出除恶务尽的精神把四害消灭干净，并在消灭四害的基础上，进一步消灭臭虫、跳蚤、虱子、白蛉子、蟑螂、钉螺等。
    曾希圣在谈到怎样除四害时说，必须充分认识四害的危害性，必须像消灭阶级敌人一样消灭它们。要坚决克服除四害的被动性，变被动为主动。几千年来，蚊子咬人，鼠雀猖狂为害；人们对四害总是应付，处于被动地位。为什么呢？因为过去的反动统治阶级不关心人民疾苦，而人民受着统治阶级的残酷剥削和压迫，生活非常痛苦，根本不可能主动向四害进行斗争，更不可能设想要消灭四害。现在人民成了国家的主人，不能再让四害危害我们，必须主动地积极地彻底消灭四害。他说，被动和主动是矛盾的两个方面，不主动就被动，要主动就必须摆脱被动，我们一定要转到被动的对立面，掌握主动。曾希圣说，要加强党的领导，充分发动群众。各级党委应该积极领导这一斗争，切实做到书记动手，党员带头，全民动员，使全省男女老少全部投入到歼灭四害的战斗中去，并对除四害和其他各项工作全面加以安排。
    曾希圣强调指出：除四害必须彻底批判和克服右倾保守思想，坚定革命斗志，在战斗中要讲究战略战术，及时总结和推广先进经验，要拿出兴修水利的干劲来开展除四害运动，并使除四害运动经常化。
    安徽省除四害总指挥部总指挥陆学斌在会上向全省人民发布了除四害总动员令，号召全省人民立即行动起来，投入除四害战斗。
    安徽省除四害总指挥部副总指挥兼合肥市除四害总指挥傅大章，在会上表示有信心两年内在合肥消灭老鼠、麻雀、蚊子、苍蝇、臭虫、蟑螂等六害。
    本报杭州17日电　浙江省七年左右消灭“四害”，争取成为“四无”省的规划，已在15日浙江省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上正式通过，作为大会六项决议之一。
    浙江省消灭“四害”的规划，针对了城乡和原来卫生环境好或差的地区，提出了不同的要求：杭州、宁波、温州、嘉兴、绍兴、湖州、金华等七市及衢州、建德、临海、定海等城镇，提前在两年至三年内消灭“四害”，达到“四无”；一般城镇和重要交通沿线，在五年内达到“四无”；在此同时，并要彻底消灭臭虫、跳蚤、虱子和蟑螂。
    现在全省已有五十多个市、县制定了消灭“四害”长远或突击计划。杭州市提出要在两年内消灭“四害”，省、市级机关并已制订出一年内基本消灭四害，两年内彻底消灭四害的行动计划。在血吸虫病流行较广的嘉兴地区，在制定消灭四害规划的同时，要求积极消灭钉螺，争取今年内做到县县有“五无镇”，乡乡有“五无村”；全区将要创造六十七个“无钉螺乡”，五十三个“无蚊无蝇镇”和两个“无蝇无蚊”市。
    本报南京17日电　江苏省规划八年成为“四无”省。这是中共江苏省委最近成立的除四害爱国卫生运动领导小组在14日召开的第一次会议上宣布的。这个领导小组由十二个同志组成，由中共江苏省委书记陈光担任组长，孙加诺、管文蔚、何冰皓担任副组长。
    在领导小组会议上，研究决定在八年内把江苏省变成“四无”省，并且力争提前实现；要求自目前起至春节，全省捕鼠二千五百万只，捉雀一千万只，灭蚊二千斤，灭蝇九千斤，积杂肥四千万担。
    会议认为，江苏省血吸虫病流行是严重的，决定将血吸虫中间宿主——钉螺列为一害，同时消灭。
    会议对除四害、爱国卫生运动的宣传工作和建立各级领导组织，以及具体办公机构等也作了研究，以便更好地指导运动前进。
