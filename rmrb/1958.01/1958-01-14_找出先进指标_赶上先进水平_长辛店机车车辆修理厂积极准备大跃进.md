    Find Advanced Indicators, Catch Up with Advanced Levels
    Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Actively Prepares for the Great Leap Forward

    (Our Dispatch) Finding advanced indicators, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced – this is the resounding slogan the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has put forward to all its workers amidst the Great Leap Forward.
    This year, the factory's locomotive repair tasks will increase by 44% compared to last year, and passenger car repair tasks will increase by 33%. However, the state has only approved 40% of the raw material allocation for the first half of the year. With increased tasks and insufficient raw material supply, what should be done?
    In 1957, none of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's indicators reached the national advanced level, but it was also not particularly backward. Some employees developed a mentality of being "better than those below but not as good as those above," content with the status quo and lacking ambition. At the beginning of the new year, the factory's Party Committee believed that this stagnant atmosphere could not be allowed to persist. To move forward with great strides, this stagnation must be swept away. Finding advanced indicators and establishing a contrasting comparison within the enterprise, using advanced achievements to compare with the factory's backward phenomena, would encourage those who were content with the status quo to rouse themselves and catch up. To find advanced indicators, they sent some cadres to other factories to search for them, while analyzing the key factors behind those factories' advanced achievements.
    The cost of overhauling each locomotive at the Changxindian Factory was 28,000 yuan, while at the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory, it only cost 21,000 yuan. Why did the Changxindian Factory's repair cost per locomotive exceed the advanced factory's cost by 7,000 yuan? In terms of intermediate locomotive repairs, the Mudanjiang Factory only spent 18,500 yuan per locomotive, while the Changxindian Factory's cost was 22,000 yuan. For hard-seat steel passenger cars, the Puzhen Factory's cost was 13,000 yuan, while the Changxindian Factory's cost was 21,000 yuan. The difference was 8,000 yuan. The overhaul cost for wooden hard-berth sleeper cars at the Harbin Factory was 11,000 yuan, while the Changxindian Factory's cost was 15,000 yuan. In other important indicators, such as the number of days a locomotive spent in the factory, the Qishuyan Locomotive Repair Factory took 14.8 days, while the Changxindian Factory took 16.8 days. The latter extended the time by two days. For passenger car overhauls, the Harbin Factory took 28.1 days, while Changxindian took 32.7 days. The time spent in the factory at Changxindian was more than four and a half days longer than the advanced indicators.
    After these backward and advanced figures were announced inside and outside the Party, they inspired people to strive for progress, to study key production factors, improve operational techniques, fully tap the potential of the enterprise, eliminate waste, change the backward state, and establish the idea of catching up with the advanced. However, some people also thought: "Our factory is leaping forward, and the advanced factories are also leaping forward. As soon as you catch up with them, they will surpass you again. How can we catch up?" Others said: "To catch up with the advanced, we should bury our heads and work quietly. Why make such a big fanfare about it?" Still others, without seriously analyzing the favorable and unfavorable factors within the enterprise, blindly shouted: "Catching up with the advanced is nothing great. With just a little effort, we will leave the past advanced indicators behind." Although the number of people holding these opinions was not large in the factory, their influence was not small. To truly create a situation in the enterprise where everyone was united and working together, the factory's Party Committee decided to conduct meticulous educational work among these people. In various meetings, they not only talked about production tasks but also paid attention to the domestic and international political situation, the ideological state of the factory's employees, and the principles of the Great Leap Forward. As a result, those who previously had narrow horizons and were confined to a small circle broadened their minds and increased their ambition. A spirit of striving for the top also appeared in their thinking.
    Currently, the factory's state tasks have been discussed many times, and everyone unanimously guarantees that, in addition to unconditionally accepting the state tasks, they will also propose to complete the annual production plan for locomotive and passenger car repairs one month and half a month ahead of schedule, respectively. At the same time, they have identified advanced indicators in terms of improving quality, shortening the production cycle, reducing product costs, and increasing labor productivity, and have taken concrete measures to catch up with these advanced indicators. In terms of cost reduction, they are learning from the advanced indicators of Mudanjiang, Huangguantun, and Puzhen. Specific measures include: vigorously saving non-ferrous metals and wood, and fully utilizing waste materials, old materials, and substitutes. Recently, they are organizing a large-scale special forum to expose waste. In terms of shortening the production cycle, they have proposed a target of no more than fourteen days. According to statistics from early January, the number of days their locomotives spent in the factory has already reached twelve days; thus, they have surpassed the advanced indicator of 14.8 days at Qishuyan. Of course, the Qishuyan Factory will also break through its original indicator. The employees of the Changxindian Factory have made full ideological preparations for this. Specific measures include starting repair work on incoming locomotives and rolling stock on the second day; and widely adopting parts interchangeability, parallel operation of work sections, and implementing a one-time material issuance system to ensure the shortening of the cycle.
    To ensure the implementation of the above measures, the factory is preparing, after the special forum on exposing waste, to lead the production upsurge that has already appeared in the factory to a newer stage.

### 找出先进指标　赶上先进水平  长辛店机车车辆修理厂积极准备大跃进

    找出先进指标　赶上先进水平
    长辛店机车车辆修理厂积极准备大跃进
    本报讯　找先进指标，向先进看齐，赶上先进，这是长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在大跃进声中，向全厂职工提出的响亮的口号。
    这个工厂今年的机车修理任务将比去年增加44％，客车修理任务增加33％。而原材料的供应，今年上半年国家只批准调拨40％。任务加大了，原材料又供应不足，在这样的情况下，应该怎么办呢？
    1957年长辛店机车车辆修理工厂没有一项指标是全国先进水平的，但是也不十分落后。部分职工思想上就产生了一种比上不足比下有余，安于现状、不求上进的情绪。新的一年开始，工厂党委会认为不能让这种暮气存在下去，要大踏步前进，必须扫除这种暮气。寻找先进指标，在企业里树立对立面，用先进的事物和企业里的落后现象作评比，激励那些安于现状的人，鼓起劲来，迎头赶上。为了寻找先进的指标，他们曾派了一些干部到外厂去找先进指标，同时对外厂所以获得先进成就的关键进行了分析。
    每一辆机车大修的成本，长辛店工厂是花二万八千元，而在牡丹江机车修理工厂只花二万一千元。为什么长辛店工厂每台机车的修理成本要比先进厂的成本多花七千元呢？在机车中修方面，牡丹江工厂每台只花一万八千五百元，长辛店工厂的成本却是二万二千元。在钢壁硬席客车方面，浦镇工厂的成本是一万三千元，长辛店工厂却是二万一千元。其中差距是八千元。木制硬席卧车大修费哈尔滨工厂是一万一千元，长辛店工厂是一万五千元。其他方面的重要指标，如机车在厂日数，戚墅堰机车修理工厂是十四点八天，长辛店工厂是十六点八天，机车在厂日数后者比前者多延长了两天。客车大修，哈尔滨工厂是二十八点一天，长辛店却要三十二点七天。在厂时间，长辛店工厂比先进指标多延长了四天半以上。
    这些落后与先进的数字，在党内外宣布以后，它启发人们上进，启发人们研究生产关键、改进操作技术、充分挖掘企业潜力、杜绝浪费、改变落后状态，树立赶上先进的思想。但是，也有人认为：我们厂在跃进，人家先进工厂也在跃进，你刚赶上他，他又超过你了。这怎么能够赶得上呢？另外也有些人说：赶上先进，埋下头来不声不响地赶就是了，何必要大张旗鼓讲呢？还有一些人，他们并没有认真地分析企业里的有利因素和不利因素，却在盲目地哄叫：赶上先进，没什么了不起，只要稍稍努一把力，过去的先进指标，就被我们扔在屁股后面了。持这些意见的人，在这个工厂人数虽不多，影响却不小。为了使企业真正形成一种上下一致全厂同心的促进派，工厂党委会就决定在这些人中间，进行细致的教育工作。在各种会议上，他们除了讲生产任务以外，还注意讲国内外的政治形势，讲厂里职工的思想状况，讲大跃进的道理。这样，那些过去目光短浅限在一个小圈子里的人，心胸开阔了，气魄也大了，在这些人的思想上也出现了一股力争上游的劲头。
    目前这个工厂的国家任务已经过多次讨论，大家一致保证，除不折不扣地接受国家任务外，还提出机车客车修理任务，要分别提前一个月和半个月完成全年的生产计划。同时在提高质量、缩短生产周期、降低产品成本、提高劳动生产率等方面，找出了先进指标，并采取具体措施，赶上这些先进指标。在降低成本方面，他们是向牡丹江、皇姑屯、浦镇等先进指标看齐。具体措施是：大力节约有色金属和木材，充分利用废料旧料和代用品。最近他们正在组织一次大规模反对浪费的专题鸣放。在缩短生产周期方面，他们提出了不超过十四天的指标。据1月上旬的统计，他们机车在厂日数，已经达到了十二天；这样就赶过了戚墅堰十四点八天的先进指标，当然戚墅堰工厂也会突破原来的指标的，对于这一点，长辛店工厂的职工已经做了充分的思想准备。具体措施是，入厂机车车辆在第二天就开工修理；同时还广泛采用配件互换、工段开展平行作业、贯彻一次发料制度等来保证周期的缩短。
    为了保证上述措施的实现，这个厂准备继揭发浪费的专题鸣放以后，把全厂已经出现的生产高潮，引向更新的阶段。
