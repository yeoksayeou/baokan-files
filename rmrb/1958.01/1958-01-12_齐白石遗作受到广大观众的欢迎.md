    Qi Baishi's posthumous works are welcomed by the broad audience
    (Our report) The Qi Baishi's posthumous works exhibition has been open for a week in the Soviet Exhibition Hall, and the audience has reached more than 20,000 people.
    There is a feature in the audience's visit to this exhibition: generally, they spend two to four hours in the venue; some people go out for lunch after visiting for half a day and then buy tickets to enter again; some people even visit four times and want to come again; many audiences copy Qi Baishi's quotations, painting title poems, and descriptions of the works at various stages in the venue. The lounge is often full of people, smoking and drinking water, while talking about their personal feelings and their favorite works. The counter in the sales area is also crowded with people, because the audience can add a commemorative stamp of the exhibition on the replicas of Qi Baishi, Xu Beihong, and Huang Binhong's works they bought.
    Whether it is people who originally loved Qi Baishi's works or people who originally thought Qi Baishi's paintings were just a quick stroke but cleverly vivid, they are deeply moved after seeing them. Many viewers wrote down their opinions, believing that after reading Qi Baishi's early works and drafts, they realized how much hard work and creative perseverance it takes to become a great artist. Some people said that they were educated from the old man's works that satirized the exploitation of the old society and corrupt officials (such as "Abacus" and "Roly-poly Toy"). Some people have a particularly deep understanding of the fact that the old man's works are full of the feelings of the working people. A viewer praised the old man's simple qualities in the form of a poem in the opinion book. At the same time, the audience also appreciated the works of Huang Binhong and Xu Beihong and asked for more introductions and publications.
    Artists and young art workers regard these exhibits as objects of research and learning. For example, Li Keran, a Chinese painter who once studied under the old man Baishi, said that there is too much to learn from here. The Chinese painting department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts suspended classes for three days from the 6th to allow all students to study at the exhibition. On the first day, teachers led the students to explain the works, on the second day, they observed and took notes, and on the third day, they prepared to have a discussion on issues such as formal likeness and spiritual likeness, sketching and copying. Students from other departments are also asking teachers to attend classes at the venue. The Chinese Artists Association will prepare to hold a symposium in the near future.
    In the short exhibition days, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, as well as heads of various government departments and literary and art groups such as Xie Juezai, Zhang Xiruo, Qian Junrui, Xia Yan, and Yang Hansheng also visited the exhibition, some even watched it twice or four times.
    At the request of cadres, workers, and students, the exhibition has extended the daily visit time to 8:30 pm.

### 齐白石遗作受到广大观众的欢迎

    齐白石遗作受到广大观众的欢迎
    本报讯　齐白石遗作展览会在苏联展览馆开幕一星期以来，观众已达两万余人。
    这一展览会观众参观的情况有一个特点：一般的在会场中看到两小时至四小时；有些人参观半日后出去进餐再购票入场；也有的一连参观了四次还要再来；许多观众在会场中抄写齐白石语录、画题诗和会场中对于作品各阶段的说明。休息厅里经常坐满了人，一面吸烟喝水，一面交谈着个人的观感和他们最欣赏的作品。这里售品处的柜台前面也挤满了人，因为观众在所买的齐白石、徐悲鸿、黄宾虹作品的复制品上面可以加盖展览会的纪念图章。
    无论是原来爱好齐白石作品的人或原来以为齐白石的画只不过是大笔一挥但却巧妙生动的人，看后都深深的受到感动。许多观众写下他们的意见，认为看了齐白石早年的作品和画稿才体会到成为一位伟大的艺术家是需要多少的艰苦劳动和多大的创造毅力。有人说，他从老人对于旧社会的剥削和贪官污吏的辛辣讽刺的作品（如“算盘”“不倒翁”等）中受到教育。也有人对于老人作品中充满了劳动人民的感情这一点体会的特别深刻，一位观众在意见簿上以题诗的方式歌颂着老人这种朴素的品质。同时观众也非常欣赏黄宾虹和徐悲鸿的作品，要求更多的介绍和出版。
    美术家和青年美术工作者更把这些展品当作研究和学习的对象。如曾拜白石老人为师的国画家李可染说，从这里值得学习的太多了。中央美术学院彩墨画系从6日起停课三天，让全体同学到展览会学习。第一天由教员带领讲解作品，第二天观摩记笔记，第三天准备座谈讨论一些如形似与神似、写生与临摹的问题。其他各系的同学也在纷纷要求教员到会场上课。中国美术家协会将准备在最近召开座谈会。
   在短短展出的几天中，陈毅副总理、李先念副总理，李济深副委员长、陈叔通副委员长以及政府各部和文艺团体负责人谢觉哉、张奚若、钱俊瑞、夏衍、阳翰笙等也都参观了展览，有的甚至一连看了两次或四次。
    展览会应干部、工人和学生的要求，已将每日参观的时间延长至下午八时半。
