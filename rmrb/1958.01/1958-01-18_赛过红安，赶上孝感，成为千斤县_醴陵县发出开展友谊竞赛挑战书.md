Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: Liling County in Hunan Province, the first to achieve a grain yield of 802 jin per mu, issued a friendship competition challenge on the 15th to the nationally renowned Xiaogan County and Hong'an County in Hubei Province with the slogan "Surpass Hong'an, Catch Up with Xiaogan," aiming to become a "Thousand-Jin County" this year. The county also hopes that their challenge will receive a widespread response from the 65 advanced counties and cities nationwide that have already achieved the targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin.

The challenge states: "In 1957, the comrades in Xiaogan and Hong'an counties achieved large-scale, high-yield grain production, which is a glory for the Party and also a glory for the working people. It is a great encouragement to the people of the whole country, especially to us in Liling County. In addition to expressing our warm congratulations to you, we recently convened the county's Party Congress, implemented the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee and the Hunan Provincial Party Congress, learned from your region's experience in agricultural high-yield production, and analyzed the specific situation in all aspects of Liling County, criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking. Everyone unanimously believes that it is entirely within our grasp to achieve a grain output of 1,000 jin per mu in 1958 on the basis of the average yield of 802 jin per mu in 1957. We have decided to transfer seven of the twenty-two county committee members to serve as Party secretaries of townships, and more than half of the other members will spend time in the countryside to lead production. A number of key personnel from the townships will also be transferred to lead the cooperatives. At the same time, a large number of cadres will be transferred from county-level organs to the countryside to run cooperatives in order to strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural production. We have also decided that all county and township leaders and general cadres will work on experimental plots this year, learning skills in practice, and requiring all cadres in the county who go to the countryside to run cooperatives to achieve 'three heads,' 'three transformations,' and 'two changes,' that is, 'barefoot, bald head, holding a hoe, taking the lead in production,' 'cadres become peasants, life is integrated with the masses, production is regularized,' and 'laymen become experts, experts become specialists,' organizing the broad masses, with the strong will of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, to work hard and forge ahead bravely.

The challenge states: "In order to realize a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 and complete the glorious and great task of a thousand-jin county, we will take the following measures to increase production:

　　1. This winter, we will complete a water conservancy plan involving 6.4 million labor days to ensure that we can resist drought in times of drought and prevent drought in times of no drought, so that the entire county will not suffer from disaster or reduced production even with severe drought for more than 65 days.

　　2. In 1958, each mu of paddy field in the county will be fertilized with more than 300 dan of mixed fertilizer, and each mu of dry land will be fertilized with more than 150 dan. The main methods of accumulating fertilizer are: (1) Cultivating green manure. All 410,000 mu of red clover seed fields in the county will have drainage ditches opened on the mounds, and fertilizer will be applied twice in winter and spring, requiring an average yield of more than 2,500 jin per mu. (2) Improving the experience of all farmers in the county in accumulating, making, preserving, and rationally using fertilizer, vigorously accumulating household fertilizer, fermenting pond fertilizer, burning fire-soil ash, and increasing the accumulation of various soil fertilizers. (3) Vigorously developing animal husbandry and increasing livestock fertilizer. In 1958, the county will develop 725,000 pigs (including 250,000 collectively raised pigs), with an average of five pigs per household.

　　3. Improve the soil and increase the yield of 250,000 mu of low-yield fields to overcome the phenomenon of unbalanced production.

　　4. Promote advanced experience, and reform the cropping system and cultivation techniques according to local conditions: (1) Change intercropping to continuous cropping, and change sparse planting to dense planting. On the basis of 330,000 mu of continuous cropping in 1957, it is required that the entire county reach 570,000 mu this year, accounting for 84% of the total farmland, and universally implement dense planting. (2) Early rice will universally promote Nantuo No. 1 and some Red Foot Early varieties; late rice will universally promote excellent varieties from Zhejiang. At the same time, the county will expand the planting of late japonica rice by more than 100,000 mu. (3) Ensure seizing the season and grasping the right moment, not missing the farming season. Implement meticulous cultivation, deep plowing and dense harrowing, and cultivate strong seedlings. Achieve careful threshing and harvesting, and return every grain to the household. It is also necessary to implement the pest control policy of "treating early, treating small, and treating thoroughly," promptly eliminating and controlling pests, implementing rational fertilization, and preventing lodging from green wind, and other technical measures.

The challenge concludes, "In order to exchange experiences, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, and better organize a great leap forward in agricultural production, we confidently put forward the battle cry of 'Surpass Hong'an, Catch Up with Xiaogan' to carry out a revolutionary friendship competition with you. We believe, and also eagerly hope, that the comrades of Xiaogan and Hong'an counties, who have already become advanced elder brothers, will definitely be able to give us assistance in all aspects during the competition."

    赛过红安，赶上孝感，成为千斤县
    醴陵县发出开展友谊竞赛挑战书
    新华社长沙16日电　湖南省第一个实现粮食亩产八百零二斤的醴陵县，15日以“赛过红安、赶上孝感”的口号，向全国闻名的湖北省孝感县和红安县发出了开展千斤丰产友谊竞赛挑战书，要在今年变成“千斤县”。这个县还希望他们的挑战能得到已经实现四百、五百、八百斤指标的全国六十五个先进县市的广泛反应。
    挑战书说：“1957年孝感和红安两县的同志们获得了粮食作物的大面积高额丰产，这是党的光荣，也是劳动人民的光荣。对全国人民尤其对我们醴陵县来说，是一个很大的鼓舞。我们除了向你们表示热烈的祝贺外，最近召开了县的党代表大会，贯彻了党的三中全会与湖南省党代表大会的精神，学习了你们地区农业丰产的经验，分析了醴陵县各方面的具体情况，批判了右倾保守思想。大家一致认为在1957年每亩平均产粮八百零二斤的基础上，实现粮食千斤县是完全有把握的，我们决定在二十二个县委委员中抽调七人下乡担任乡的党委书记，其他委员要有一半以上的时间下乡领导生产。乡的骨干也要抽调一批担任社的领导。同时还要从县级机关中抽调大批干部下乡办社，以加强党对农业生产的领导。我们还决定所有的县、乡领导干部和一般干部在今年都要搞试验田，要在实践中学会本领，要求全县下乡办社的干部，做到“三头”、“三化”、“两变”，即“赤脚光头、手拿锄头，生产带头”、“干部农民化、生活群众化、生产经常化”和“外行变内行，内行变专家”，组织广大群众，以愚公移山的坚强意志，苦战苦干，奋勇前进。
    挑战书说：“为了实现1958年农业生产大跃进，完成粮食千斤县的光荣伟大任务，我们将采取以下增产措施：
    一、今冬要完成六百四十万个劳动日的水利计划，做到有旱抗旱，无旱防旱，使全县大旱六十五天以上也不受灾减产。
    二、1958年全县水田每亩施混合肥三百担以上，旱土一百五十担以上。积肥的主要办法是：（1）培育绿肥。全县四十一万亩红花草子，丘丘开沟排水，冬春追肥两次，要求平均每亩产二千五百斤以上。（2）提高全县农民积肥造肥保肥与合理用肥的经验，大力积聚家肥，沤制氹肥，烧制火土灰，增积各种土肥。（3）大力发展畜牧业，增加牲畜肥料。1958年全县发展生猪七十二万五千头（其中集体养猪二十五万头），每户平均五头。
    三、改良土壤，提高二十五万亩低产田产量，克服生产不平衡现象。
    四、推广先进经验，因地制宜改革耕作制度和耕作技术：（1）改间作为连作，改稀植为密植。在1957年连作三十三万亩的基础上，要求今年全县达到五十七万亩，占总田亩84％，并普遍实行密植。（2）早稻普遍推广南特号和部分红脚早；晚稻普遍推广浙江优良品种。同时全县扩种晚粳十万亩以上。（3）做到抓住季节，抓住火色，不误农时。实行精耕细作，深犁密耙，培育壮秧。做到细打细收，颗粒还家。还要贯彻“治早、治少、治了”的治虫方针，及时除治虫害，实行合理施肥，防止青风倒伏等一系列的技术措施。
    挑战书最后说，“为了互相交流经验，鼓舞革命干劲，更好地组织农业生产大跃进，我们满怀信心地提出‘赛过红安、赶上孝感’的战斗口号，来和你们开展革命的友谊竞赛。我们相信，同时也迫切希望已经成为先进老大哥的孝感和红安县全体同志们，在竞赛中一定能够给我们以各方面的帮助。
