Salty Wasteland on the Bohai Coast Can Also Yield a Thousand Jin Per Mu
Zhang Zongyin

According to the "Forty Articles," the Hebei region's "crossing the Yellow River" (average grain yield reaching or exceeding four hundred jin per mu) is a twelve-year journey; "crossing the Huai River" again (grain yield of eight hundred jin per mu), the road will naturally be even more distant. On the sandy land of the Bohai Sea coast, a red steed appeared—the Shajingzi Village Mutual Aid Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuanjing Township, Huanghua County. It galloped and leaped on the arduous road, crossing the Yellow River and the Huai River in two years, and reached an even more distant destination—more than a thousand jin per mu. How encouraging and inspiring!

From Disaster-Ridden to Bumper Harvests

Shajingzi Village was originally a place on the "edge of the sea of suffering," "barren twice a year," and plagued by disasters. The village was surrounded by large tracts of saline-alkali wasteland, covered with weeds, with only a few crops. Locust plagues were particularly severe here. When locusts swarmed, one could step on seven or eight locusts with one foot. The dense swarms of locusts could cover the sky and the sun when they took off. When locusts came, they could wipe out crops, reeds, and weeds overnight. The people here mostly relied on carrying long-term labor or doing odd jobs in Xiaozhan or other areas, or gathering firewood, catching small fish, and collecting grass seeds for a living, with an average annual income of about eight yuan per person. They mainly ate "wild grains" such as yellow alfalfa seeds, wild millet seeds, Heluo seeds, and slag grass seeds. They wore ragged clothes that had been worn for half a lifetime, sewn and patched repeatedly, barely able to cover their bodies. In this small village of dozens of households, about forty people starved to death and fourteen fled the famine in the year or so from 1943 to 1944, and five families sold their children.

After the Cangxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed vigorously carrying out the "One Reclamation and Three Transformations" movement, under the correct leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the state, the mutual aid agricultural production cooperative was established in 1956. Seven hundred and ninety-eight new households were relocated from places thirty or forty miles away from Shajingzi Village. Their original situation was slightly better than that of Shajingzi Village, but it was also very difficult. Together with the original seventy-six households in Shajingzi, they formed the mutual aid agricultural cooperative, reclaimed large tracts of wasteland, and planted rice. (They had more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields in total, of which about 9,000 mu were planted with rice seedlings.) They achieved a bumper harvest that year, with an average yield of 625 jin per mu. All the members of the cooperative continued their efforts and worked diligently, creating another miracle of large-scale high-yield and bumper harvests in 1957—more than 9 million jin of rice were produced in 9,000 mu of fields (an average yield of 1,023 jin per mu; of which 40 mu averaged 1,500 jin per mu), more than 10 million jin of rice straw, 1 million jin of reeds, and 190,000 jin of fish. In 1957, they sold 7.2 million jin of rice, 1.3 million jin of rice straw, 1 million jin of reeds, and 190,000 jin of fish to the state; they also planned to buy 20,000 yuan of public bonds. This year, the average income per labor force was 1,223.8 yuan, the average income per household was 1,453.5 yuan, and the average income per person in the entire cooperative was 538 yuan.

The Driving Force Behind the Miracle

Cangxian Prefecture has many wastelands, many perennially waterlogged depressions, and a large proportion of saline-alkali land and low-lying waterlogged land in cultivated land (accounting for 53% of the total cultivated land). In response to the characteristics of the entire prefecture, the Cangxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, adhering to the principle of actively leading, steadily advancing, adapting to, utilizing, and transforming nature, advocated a "One Reclamation and Three Transformations" movement.

(One reclamation refers to reclaiming wasteland; three transformations refer to the transformation of saline-alkali land, the transformation of low-lying land, and the reform of crop planting.) The mutual aid agricultural cooperative is a socialist flower blooming in this movement. With the "One Reclamation and Three Transformations" movement, another thousand-jin cooperative appeared on the Hebei Plain, on the perennially waterlogged saline-alkali wasteland. The reclamation and transformation headquarters jointly organized by the party committees at the prefecture, county, district, and township levels, as well as the special and county party and government leaders, conducted in-depth and specific leadership of the mutual aid cooperative, helping to come up with ideas and solutions, and promptly helping to solve some difficult problems in production and work. The secretary of the prefectural committee came to the cooperative many times; the secretary of the district committee went deep into a production team for a long time to understand the situation and guide the work. The party branch also truly played the role of a fighting fortress. The party members and members of the Communist Youth League realized that they were the vanguards of the socialist great march, and consciously played an exemplary and leading role in production and work. In the early morning of the second month of the lunar calendar, when the ice was still half a finger thick, party members Feng Changqing and Zuo Shaoshan led the members to break the ice and go into the water to dig ditches. As a result, they completed the arduous task of digging ditches in the cold weather. In April 1957, when the supply and marketing cooperative was shipping chemical fertilizers by boat, it encountered a strong wind, and thirteen boats sank. In the pouring rain and the strong northeast wind, under the leadership of party members Wang Tonglin and Fang Yingpu, 300 members took off their cotton clothes and jumped into the water to rescue the fertilizers in the Beidagang, which was one and a half people deep, saving 56,000 jin of chemical fertilizers from loss. On the Beidagang dike, the culvert of the water diversion channel built by the mutual aid cooperative broke, and the large dike breached. Comrade Cai Wanfa, a member of the general branch and deputy director of the cooperative affairs management committee, at this extremely urgent and dangerous moment, bravely stepped forward at the risk of his life and jumped into the torrent to explore the water bottom and water flow situation, found a way to quickly block the breach, and avoided flood disasters.

Among the members of the mutual aid cooperative, there were 605 households of former farm laborers and poor peasants, accounting for 69.2% of the total households; 262 households of lower-middle peasants, accounting for 30%. This cooperative can be called a "poor peasant cooperative." They suffered poverty and hardship in the old society. Their average income in 1957 was more than 500 yuan per person, an increase of more than 60 times compared to the average annual income of eight yuan per person in the past. They resolutely followed the Communist Party on the socialist road, and they did whatever the Party directed. Xu Jinheng, Fang Lanpu, and more than a dozen other poor peasant members, who used to work as long-term laborers or odd jobbers in Xiaozhan, have been trained to become experts in rice cultivation. Now, they are producing rice for themselves. They are particularly enthusiastic about running the cooperative, and often use the rest time during ditch digging to use horsetail grass as rice seedlings to demonstrate planting operations on the ground, teaching young people how to germinate seeds and how to transplant seedlings.

The Most Valuable Thing is Labor

The mutual aid cooperative started from scratch on the wasteland, and there were many difficulties. Most of the members did not know rice planting techniques; production materials were lacking this and that.... The members fought bravely and tenaciously against the difficulties with their diligence and wisdom, overcame numerous difficulties, and gained rich experience in the struggle.

In 1956, in order to study technology, they used comparative methods to plant some experimental fields. After experiments, they summarized the relatively systematic technical experience of "five earlies (early seedling cultivation, early digging, early alkali washing, early transplanting, early seedling replacement), three rationals (rational close planting, rational irrigation, rational fertilization), one deep (deep digging), one shallow (shallow plowing of seedbeds)", and combining weeding and manure accumulation.

The most valuable thing is labor. They used the superior conditions of collectivization to give full play to the role of labor. During the busy farming season, men, women, full, and semi-labor forces concentrated their efforts on planting rice; during the slack season, male laborers fished, cut reeds, and gathered grass, and female laborers bundled rice straw and weaved fishing nets. In 1957, there were 126,000 agricultural workdays, 60,000 sideline workdays, 20,000 other workdays, and 1,800 cooperative affairs workdays, totaling 207,800 workdays in the cooperative; in addition, 30,000 workdays of voluntary labor were contributed to the state. The entire cooperative has 1,038 male, female, full, and semi-labor forces, with an average of 274 workdays per person per year (of which male laborers averaged 311 workdays and female laborers averaged 220 workdays), exceeding the national agricultural development outline requirements to be achieved in seven years. They also gave full play to the enthusiasm of auxiliary labor forces and female labor forces burdened with housework. Old men around sixty years old raised pigs, collected pig feed, and accumulated manure; old men around seventy years old carried manure baskets to collect manure; old women and women who could not work in the fields, in addition to taking care of housework, weaved fishing nets at home; children picked up rice ears. Everyone with labor ability truly did their best and got what they deserved. There were 64 old men around seventy years old in the cooperative, who carried manure baskets to collect manure all year round, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. In 1957, they collected a total of 1 million jin of dry manure and 1 million jin of livestock manure. The manure was converted into money for the cooperative, and cash was paid. The cooperative received 2 million jin of manure and paid a total of 28,000 yuan in manure money. Kuang Daibo, the father of Kuang Qifeng, the secretary of the general branch, is seventy-six years old this year. He is the most active in collecting manure. He collected 26,000 jin of dry manure in a year, which was converted into 676 yuan in cash. There are many migrant workers here, and there are many vehicles, horses, and pedestrians on the large dike, making it easy to collect manure.

This year, children are organized to pick up rice ears in the fields; pick up dropped rice ears on the rice straw; the two items yielded a total of 80,000 jin of rice, and remuneration was paid according to the number of jin of rice ears picked up by each person. The cooperative paid out a total of 5,600 yuan in cash.

The labor efficiency of the members has also been greatly improved. When transplanting seedlings, people go to the fields at dawn with dry food, send meals to the fields at noon, and return home at dark, working continuously in the fields for twelve hours. Not only is the working time extended, but people also work very hard, transplanting an average of two mu of seedlings per person per day (the old habit was one mu per person per day), which can complete the seedling transplanting task half a month in advance.

The rice fields of the mutual aid cooperative are sixteen li long from south to north and four li wide from east to west. The heavy transportation tasks of transporting fertilizers and rice every year cannot be completed in two years with the existing manpower and animal power using large carts. This is the biggest difficulty. The wisdom of the masses is the source of great power. They came up with a good way to replace large carts with ice sleds on the canals in winter, overcoming this difficulty.

No Collective Interest, No Personal Interest

The lives of the members of the mutual aid cooperative are indeed very happy. More than 700 new houses have been built in two years, and another 1,000 are planned to be built. Usually, they eat mostly the rice they produce, and sometimes eat some white flour and corn flour. Broken clothes and broken quilts, except for those left in the exhibition shed as "teaching materials," can no longer be seen. There is a supply and marketing cooperative in the village, with more than 2,000 kinds of goods, and the members can buy whatever they want. The cooperative has electric mills, mechanical threshers, and sewing machines. Rice milling, flour grinding, making clothes, making large shoes, and other household chores that used to burden women are all done by machines, and most women can easily and happily participate in field labor with men.

The living standards of the cooperative cadres have also greatly improved with the improvement of the cooperative's production level and the living standards of the members. Zhang Chengxian, the vice governor of Hebei Province, said after talking with Yuan Yutian, the deputy secretary of the general branch and the deputy director of the cooperative: "Comrade Yutian, your treatment is generally as high as that of the county party secretary of your county."

How did these happy lives come about? This is not what individualists who always want to harm the collective interest can pursue, but is obtained under the socialist system, on the basis of striving for and safeguarding the collective interest.

When the cooperative was first established in the spring of the year before last, the members only had a strong socialist spirit and hardworking hands, and nothing else. Because they started from scratch on the wasteland, the state loaned them 180,000 yuan and allocated 50,000 yuan of rice as advance deposit. More than 300 laborers from brother cooperatives helped them dig two canals with more than 20,000 cubic meters of earth. Comrades from the technology station constantly went to guide the technology. These are all practical benefits that can be obtained under the socialist system. Without these conditions, there would be no mutual aid cooperative, no "thousand-jin rice per mu" in the mutual aid cooperative, and therefore no happy life as it is now.

How can the members of the mutual aid cooperative not love the collective interest and love socialism? They have made extremely important contributions to the collective interest. In 1957 alone, they sold 7.2 million jin of grain to the state, 190,000 jin of fish (exported to exchange for machinery), more than 1 million jin of rice straw, and 1 million jin of reeds (raw materials for papermaking). In 1957, they contributed 30,000 workdays of voluntary labor to the state. They also plan to buy 20,000 yuan of public bonds.

Has the mutual aid cooperative's contribution to the state and assistance to brother cooperatives harmed the interests of the members, or affected their production and life? No. Precisely because their personal interests are closely linked with the collective interest, their personal interests are growing year by year. Now the cooperative has a public accumulation worth 431,180 yuan, and has strong funds, machines, farm tools, transportation tools, seeds, and fertilizers. In addition, there are 280,000 yuan in cash as working capital. In 1956 and 1957, each member household had prepared houses, clothes, bedding, and furniture, and had a lot of savings. This year, they will distribute labor remuneration, and there will be even fewer ways to spend money, so the savings plus income will appear even more abundant. According to the 1958 production plan, the total output value can reach 1,664,300 yuan, an increase of 35.2% compared to 1957. With the increase in production, the income of the members will inevitably continue to increase. The mutual aid cooperative has been able to do not fear the three disasters (namely, floods, droughts, and insect pests), and the completion of the production plan is relatively guaranteed.

"Under the socialist system, there is no personal interest without collective interest." This truth has been confirmed in the mutual aid cooperative.

    渤海边沙荒地也能亩产千斤
    张宗荫
    按照“四十条”的规定，河北地区“跨过黄河”（粮食平均亩产达到或超过四百斤），是十二年的路程；再“渡过淮河”（粮食亩产八百斤），路途当然就更遥远了。渤海海滨的沙地上，出现了一匹红色的骏马——黄骅县远景乡沙井子村互助农业生产合作社，它在艰苦的道路上奔腾跳跃，两年就跨过了黄河、淮河，并且走到了更遥远的目的地——亩产千斤以上。多么令人欢欣鼓舞啊！
    从多灾多难到丰产丰收
    沙井子村原来是“苦海边缘”、“一年两光”、多灾多难的地方。村的周围，大都是大片的盐碱荒地，地上长满了野草，只有很少的庄稼。这里的蝗灾特别严重。闹蝗灾的时候，人走路一脚可以踩死七、八个蝗虫。密集的飞蝗群起飞之后，可以遮盖天日。飞蝗来了，一夜就能使庄稼、苇子、野草一扫而光。这里的人们，多是依靠到小站或其他地区扛长活、卖短工，或是打柴草、捕小鱼、采草籽为生，每人每年平均收入八元左右。吃的主要是黄蓿菜籽、野稗子籽、合洛籽、渣草籽等“野粮草种”。穿的是一穿半辈、缝了又缝、补了又补仅能遮体的破衣服。这个几十户人家的小村子，在1943年至1944年一年左右的时间内，就饿死了四十口人，外出逃荒的十四人，有五户卖儿女。
    中共沧县地委提出大力开展“一垦三改”运动以后，在党的正确领导下和国家的大力支持下，互助农业生产合作社于1956年建立起来了。新迁来七百九十八户，都是离沙井子村三、四十里地的人，原来的处境比沙井子村稍好些，但也非常苦。他们同沙井子原来的七十六户组成了互助农业社，开垦了大片荒地，种上了水稻。（他们共有水田一万亩多一些，其中栽秧面积约九千亩。）当年就得到了丰收，平均亩产六百二十五斤。全体社员再接再厉，辛勤劳动，1957年又创造出大面积高额丰产的奇迹——九千亩田里共生产出稻谷九百多万斤（平均亩产一千零二十三斤；其中有四十亩平均亩产一千五百斤），稻草一千多万斤，苇子一百万斤，鱼十九万斤。1957年卖给国家七百二十万斤稻谷，一百零三十万斤稻草，一百万斤苇子，十九万斤鱼；还准备买两万元的公债。这一年，每个劳力平均收入一千二百二十三元八角，每户平均收入一千四百五十三元五角，全社每人平均收入五百三十八元。创造奇迹的原动力
    沧县专区荒地多、常年积水的洼淀多，耕地中的盐碱地和低洼易涝地多（合计占总耕地的53％）。中共沧县地委针对全区特点，本着积极领导，稳步前进，适应、利用和改造自然的方针，倡导了一个“一垦三改”运动。
  （一垦是开垦荒地；三改是盐碱地改造、低洼地改造、农作物种植改革。）互助农业社就是在这个运动中开放出来的一朵社会主义之花。有了“一垦三改”运动，才在常年积水的盐碱荒地上，出现了河北平原上的又一个千斤社。地、县、区、乡各级党委及专、县党政领导共同组织的垦改指挥部，对互助社进行了深入、具体的领导，帮助出主意、想办法，及时地帮助解决生产上和工作上发生的一些困难问题。地委书记多次到这个社里来；区委书记长期深入一个生产队，了解情况，指导工作。党总支也确实发挥出战斗堡垒的作用。党员团员们认识到自己是社会主义大进军的先锋，自觉地在生产和工作中起模范作用和带头作用。旧历2月天的早晨，还冻着半指厚的冰凌，党员冯常青、左少山带动社员砸冰下水挖渠。结果完成了在大冷天下水挖渠的艰巨任务。1957年4月，供销社用船运送化学肥料的时候赶上大风，沉了十三支船。下着倾盆大雨，刮着大东北风，在党员王桐林、方应普等人的带动下，有三百个社员脱下身上的棉衣，跳下水去，到一人半深的北大港里去抢救肥料，使五万六千斤化学肥料免受损失。在北大港围堤上，互助社修的引水渠道的涵洞坏了，大围堤决口了，总支委员兼社务管理委员会副主任蔡万法同志，在这万分紧急而又危险的关头，冒着生命的危险挺身而出跳入急流，探清水底和水流情况，找出抢堵方法，很快堵住决口，免遭洪水灾害。
    在互助社的社员中间，原先的雇农和贫农共六百零五户，占总户数69.2％；下中农二百六十二户，占30％。这个社可以叫做“贫农社”。他们在旧社会受尽了贫穷和苦难的折磨。他们1957年每人平均收入五百多元，同过去每人每年平均收入八元相比，增加了六十多倍。他们坚决跟着共产党走社会主义道路，党指到哪里，他们干到哪里。徐金恒、方兰普等十几个贫农社员，原来在小站扛长活、卖短工，锻炼成了种稻的能手。现在，是为自己生产稻谷了。他们对办社特别积极，时常利用挖渠当中休息的工夫，用马鞭草当作稻秧，在地上作操作表演，教给青年们如何起芽子，如何栽秧，……。
    最可贵的是劳动力
    互助社在荒地上起家，困难是很多的。大部分社员不会种稻技术；生产资料缺这、少那……。社员们以自己的勤劳和智慧，向困难作了英勇顽强的斗争，战胜了重重困难，在斗争中取得了丰富的经验。
    1956年，他们为了研究技术，用对比的办法种了一些试验田。经过试验，总结出来了“五早（早育苗、早掘地、早洗碱、早栽秧、早补苗）、三合理（合理密植、合理灌水、合理施肥）、一深（深掘地）、一浅（苗床浅耕）”、除草积肥结合等比较系统的技术经验。
    最可贵的还是劳动力。他们运用集体化的优越条件，使劳动力充分地发挥了作用。在农忙季节，男、女、整、半劳动力集中力量种稻；农闲季节，男劳力捕鱼、割苇、打草，女劳力捆稻草、织鱼网。1957年农业用工十二万六千个，副业用工六万个，其他用工两万个，社务用工一千八百个，社内共计用工二十万零七千八百个；另外为国家出义务工三万个。全社共有男、女、整、半劳动力一千零三十八个，每人每年平均出工二百七十四天（其中男劳力平均出工三百十一天，女劳力平均出工二百二十天），提前超过了全国农业发展纲要要求七年达到的指标。他们也充分地发挥了辅助劳力和有家务劳动拖累的女劳力的积极作用。六十岁左右的老头们养猪、采打猪饲料、积肥；七十岁左右的老头们背粪筐拾粪；老太太和不能下地的妇女们除了料理家务以外，在家织鱼网；儿童们拾稻穗。凡是有劳动能力的人，真正作到了用其所长，各得其所。全社有六十四个七十岁左右的老大爷，无论春、夏、秋、冬，成年背着粪筐拾粪，1957年他们共拾了一百万斤大粪干和一百万斤牲口粪，这些粪折价归社，付给现款，社收了二百万斤粪，共付出粪款二万八千元。总支书记况其峰同志的父亲况大伯，今年七十六岁，他拾粪最积极，一年拾了二万六千斤大粪干，折现款六百七十六元。这里民工多，大围堤上车马、行人多，拾粪好拾。
    今年组织儿童们在地里拾稻穗；在稻草上拣丢落的稻穗；两项共收获了稻谷八万斤，按每人拾的稻穗斤数折款付酬，社里共付出现款五千六百元。
    社员们的劳动效率也大大地提高了。栽秧时人们拂晓带着干粮下地，中午往地里送饭，天黑才回家，在地里连续工作十二小时。不但劳动时间延长了，人们工作起来也非常紧张，每人每天平均栽秧二亩（过去老习惯是每人每天栽一亩），这样能提前半月完成栽秧任务。
    互助社的稻田从南到北有十六里地远，从东到西也有四里远。每年运送肥料、稻谷等繁重的运输任务，以现有的人力畜力，用大车运送，两年也完成不了。这是最大的一个困难。群众的智慧是巨大的力量的源泉。他们想出了冬季在渠道上用凌盘（冰床子）代替大车的好办法，把这个困难克服了。
    没有集体利益就没有个人利益
    互助社社员们的生活，确实是很幸福的。两年共盖了七百多间新房，准备再盖一千间。平时吃的多半是自己生产的大米，有时吃些白面和玉米面，副食品都是吃鱼。破衣服、破被，除了在展览棚留作“教材”的以外，再也看不到了。村里有一个供销社，有两千多种商品，社员想买的东西应有尽有。社里有电磨，有机碾，还有缝纫机，碾米、磨面、作衣服、作大鞋等等这些原来拖累妇女的家务劳动，都由机器代劳，妇女们大部分可以轻松愉快地同男人们在一起参加田间劳动了。
    社干部的生活水平，随着社的生产水平和社员生活水平的提高，也大大地提高了。河北省副省长张承先，在同总支副书记兼社的副主任元玉田谈过他的生活状况以后说：“玉田同志，你和你们县的县委书记一般高的待遇。”
    这些幸福生活究竟是怎样得来的呢？这不是总想损害集体利益的个人主义者所能追求到的，而是在社会主义制度下，在争取和维护集体利益的基础上得来的。
    前年春季刚建社的时候，社员们只是有一股热烈的坚强的社会主义劲头和勤劳的双手，别的什么也没有。因为他们是在荒地上起家，国家贷款十八万元给他们，又拨给了五万元的稻谷预付定金。兄弟社的三百多个劳力，帮助他们挖成了两万多方土的两条渠道。技术站的同志经常不断地去指导技术。这些都是在社会主义制度下才能得到的实惠。没有这些条件，就没有互助社，没有互助社的“亩产千斤稻”，也就没有现在所得到的幸福生活。
    互助社的社员们怎能不热爱集体利益热爱社会主义呢？他们对集体利益作了极重大的贡献。他们光1957年就卖给国家七百二十万斤粮食，十九万斤鱼（出口换取机器），一百多万斤稻草，一百万斤苇子（造纸的原料）。1957年给国家出了三万个义务工。他们还准备买两万元的公债。
    互助社对兄弟社也给予了无私援助。1956年借给红旗农业社二千三百八十九亩开好、整好并且已经施上肥的稻田，还帮助他们栽了七百九十亩地的秧苗；另外还有技术较好的七个社员帮助和指导他们放水，工作了二十五天。1956年帮助北大港十八个社用本社的土地育苗，并且帮了四千个工。他们还帮助常庄社育苗，帮助东升三社出秧苗。1957年，派大车帮助先锋社运砖。他们帮助的这些工，没要任何报酬。
    互助社对国家的贡献和对兄弟社的援助，是不是损害了社员们的利益，或者影响了他们的生产和生活呢？没有。正因为他们的个人利益和集体利益紧密地联结在一起，他们的个人利益才一年比一年增长。现在社里有了价值四十三万一千一百八十元的公共积累，有了雄厚的资金，机器、农具、运输工具、种籽、肥料应有尽有。另外还有二十八万元现金作为流动资金储备着。各户社员家庭，在1956年、1957年都把房屋、衣服、被褥、家具准备齐全了，并且有很多积蓄，今年再分了劳动报酬，该花钱的道就更少了，积蓄加收入就会显得更富足了。按照1958年生产规划，总产值可以达到一百六十六万四千三百元，比1957年提高35.2％。生产提高了，社员的收入也就必然要不断提高。互助社已经能作到不怕三灾（即水灾、旱灾和虫灾），生产计划的完成是比较有保障的。
    “在社会主义制度下，没有集体利益就没有个人利益。”这个真理在互助社得到了证实。
