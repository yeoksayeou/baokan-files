Let Facts Correct People's Understanding
Editor

In various provinces and regions of our country, there are some barren farmlands with poor soil and very low yields. Can the yields of these farmlands achieve a great leap forward? Is it possible for them to become fertile fields? People have two answers to this question:

One answer is negative, believing that "it would be good enough for poor land to improve gradually; a leap forward is absolutely impossible." During the discussion of the agricultural development outline, some people said: "We can meet the targets of the outline here, but all the bad land should be excluded."

The other answer is positive, believing that poor land, like everything else, can be changed. The question lies in whether we grasp the laws of their development and change, and whether we actively strive to promote their development and change.

Which answer is correct? The reports of the soil revolution in Bijie Prefecture, Guizhou Province, and the leap forward in the per-mu yield of ginned cotton from a dozen catties to 140 catties by the Jiufeng First Agricultural Cooperative in Xinzhou County, Hubei, tell people with irrefutable facts that the latter answer is correct. That is to say, poor land can be transformed into fertile fields, and low yields can be transformed into high yields.

Clarifying this issue is of great practical significance. Our country's arable land is not surplus but insufficient (less than three mu per person on average), and a considerable part of the insufficient arable land is poor land. Even in high-yield areas like Guangdong Province, there are still more than 20 million mu of low-yield fields with a per-mu yield of less than 400 catties, accounting for more than 40% of the grain crop area. Without transforming these low-yield fields into high-yield fields, it is impossible to rapidly increase the total agricultural output. However, the leading cadres in many places have been unable to view this issue from a developmental perspective. They have always lacked confidence in the improvement of poor land and the leap forward in yields. Some even allow large areas of poor land to be abandoned and uncultivated. In this way, the agricultural production of their regions cannot but be seriously affected.

We hope that these comrades can draw necessary knowledge and lessons from the above two examples and completely change their static view of certain things. The ideological understanding that has been changed through practice will, in turn, guide their actions, so that they can make fewer mistakes in new practices and achieve more complete results.

    让事实来矫正人们的认识
    编者
    在我国各个省区，都有一部分土质不良的瘠薄耕地，产量很低。这些耕地的产量能不能跃进呢？它们有没有可能变成肥田呢？人们对于这问题有两种答案：
    一种答案是否定的，认为薄地“只要能够渐进就算不错了，跃进决不可能”。在讨论农业发展纲要的时候有人说：“我们这里可以达到纲要指标，但所有的坏地要除外。”
    另外一种答案是肯定的，认为薄地也同其他一切事物一样，都是可以改变的。问题就在于是不是掌握了它们发展变化的规律，是不是积极努力去促使它们发展变化。
    哪一个答案是正确的呢？贵州省毕节专区实行土壤革命和湖北新洲县久丰第一农业社亩产皮棉由十来斤跃进到一百四十斤的报道，用无可辩驳的事实告诉人们，后一种答案是正确的。就是说，薄地可以变成肥田，低产可以变成高产。
    澄清这个问题，是有重要的实践意义的。我国耕地不是有余而是不足（每人平均不到三亩），而不足的耕地中又有相当大的一部分是薄地。就是在广东省那样的高产区，亩产四百斤以下的低产田仍有二千多万亩，占粮食作物面积十分之四以上。不把这些低产田变为高产田，农业总产量要想迅速提高是做不到的。可是有好多地方的领导干部一直不能用发展的观点看这个问题，他们对薄地的改变和产量的跃进始终缺乏信心，有的甚至听任把大片薄地抛荒不种。这样，他们地区的农业生产就不能不受到严重的影响。
    我们希望这些同志能够从上述两个事例中吸取必要的知识和教训，彻底改变自己对某些事物的静止不动的看法。经过实践而改变了的思想认识，将反转来指导他们的行动，使他们在新的实践中少犯错误，取得更加完满的效果。
