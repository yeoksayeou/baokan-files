    Big Character Posters in the Meilin Factory
    A shocking waste - 5,000 yuan
    The ducks used for canning this month (December 1957) had a lot of feathers. Some could barely be used for canning, but a large portion had so many feathers that they had to be sold at a reduced price. There were about 300 such ducks every day. In the sixteen days of production so far, there have been a total of 4,800 ducks. If each duck averages 2.5 catties, that's a total of 12,000 catties. The purchase price is currently 0.9 yuan per catty, but the selling price of these ducks is less than 0.5 yuan per catty, resulting in a loss of more than 0.4 yuan per catty, for a total loss of about 5,000 yuan. Isn't this figure shocking? Of course, it is unlikely that every duck will be without feathers, but there are too many ducks with too many feathers that do not meet the standards. The reason for this needs to be investigated. It is hoped that the purchasing department will take this wasted figure as a lesson in future raw material purchases. (Hu Gaolong)
    
    1000 Cans = ?
    In September this year (referring to 1957), a total of 75,000 cans of 1000-gram steamed pork were produced, but 1,000 cans were scrapped. What is the cost of these 1,000 cans? (1) At 3 yuan per can, the total is 3,000 yuan. (2) It takes 10 days for each person to produce 100 cans per day. (3) This money could buy monthly passes for 500 comrades to ride buses and trolleybuses for a month.
  (4) ...

    Precious time is wasted
    1. During the middle shift of the tangerine workshop, due to the restrictions of the canteen system, each person has to use 20 minutes of production time for meals. With a total of 220 people per shift, a total of 73 hours are wasted. Calculated at 5 cans of 560-gram orange segments produced per hour, 365 cans less are produced.
    2. To register at the factory's health station, one has to queue, and after seeing the doctor, one has to wait for the medicine to be dispensed. A lot of time is often wasted from queuing to register, waiting for the number to see the doctor, and then waiting for the medicine to be dispensed. In this way, working time is wasted by the health station.
    3. Due to poor supply and marketing management of the raw materials for steamed pork, the raw materials have a lot of coal dust, which forces the workshop workers to scrape or peel off a layer of skin with a knife during operation. This unexpected process reduces production by one-third. (Lu Yaqin)

    Large accumulation of funds - 30,000 yuan
    During the finance department's meeting notice in September, a resolution was made on how to handle stagnant materials: the supply and marketing department should handle the accumulated and surplus scrap iron materials in the can-making workshop. However, until now, the accumulation has only increased, to about 40,000 catties. Calculated at a purchase price of 1,500 yuan per ton, this is an accumulation of 30,000 yuan. Isn't this a waste? Please consider this, leaders. We suggest that the cut products and scrap iron materials should be controlled by the supply and marketing department, and the workshop should send the surplus iron to the supply and marketing department every day for timely handling.

    梅林厂中的大字报
    一笔惊人的浪费——五千元
    本月份（1957年12月）用来作罐头的鸭子，鸭毛非常多。有一部分勉强可以做罐头；另一部分毛多得实在没有办法的，迫得贬价出售。像这样的鸭子每天有三百只上下。到目前为止的十六天生产中，共计有四千八百只，如果每只平均二斤半，共计一万二千斤。现在进价每斤九角，而这种鸭子出售的价格却每斤五角不到，每斤要损失四角多，总的损失约五千元左右。这笔数字岂不惊人吗？当然，每只鸭子都没有毛是不大可能的，但鸭毛太多了，不符合规格的太多了，这就需要追究一下原因。希望采购部门以后在购买原料时，应以这个浪费数字作为教训。　（胡高龙）
    1000罐＝？
    今年（指1957年）9月份共生产1000公分清蒸猪肉75，000罐，而报废的却有1000罐之多。这1000罐是什么代价呢？（1）每罐以三元计算，共计3000元。（2）每人每天生产一百罐，共需十天。（3）这笔钱如果买月季票，能供五百位同志乘公共汽车、电车一个月。
  （4）……
    宝贵的时间被浪费了
    1、桔子工段的中班吃饭时间，由于食堂制度的限制，每人要利用生产时间二十分钟。每班共二百二十人，共浪费七十三小时。每小时以生产五百六十公分橘柑五罐计算，就要少生产三百六十五罐。
    2、本厂保健站去挂号要排队，看好病又要等配药。由排队挂号，等号看病，再等配药，常浪费不少时间。这样，工作时间就被保健站浪费了。
    3、清蒸猪肉的原料由于供销管理不善，原料上带有很多煤屑，使车间工人在操作时，还要用刀去刮或者剥去一层皮，这道意外的工序，要使产量降低三分之一。　（陆雅琴）
    大量积压资金——三万元
    在9月份财务科通知开会时，曾对呆滞物资如何进行处理作出了决议：把制罐车间所积压的和多余的零铁料部分由供销科进行处理，但是直到现在，反而越积越多，约有四万市斤。如以每吨进价一千五百元计算，要积压资金三万元，这是不是浪费呢？请领导上考虑。我们建议：裁制品与零铁料应由供销科掌握，车间每天把余铁再送到供销科，以便及时处理。　（制罐车间办公室）
