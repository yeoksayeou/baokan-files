    At School
    Realizing the Small Five-Year Plan
    The Young Pioneers of Dahui Factory Primary School in Fengtai District, Beijing, are striving to complete their small five-year plan. Last autumn, the Young Pioneers of this primary school collected more than 2,960 jin of grain, helped agricultural cooperatives harvest more than 500 mu of old corn, and cut 77,500 jin of grass, saving a total of 480 labor days for the agricultural cooperatives.
    Now, the members have built a "Red Scarf Zoo" that can raise nine kinds of animals, and made more than 30 flower pots for winter planting activities. The members also helped the school paste the ceilings of ten classrooms, saving the country more than 100 yuan in funds. Seeing that the school's heating coal was piled in the backyard, the members used their spare time to build two small houses, one as a storage room and one as a coal shed, to prevent rain and snow from wetting the coal.
    The members also plan to establish a Young Pioneers' small weather station in the mountainous area to help the peasant uncles observe the weather. Everyone said that they must strive to over fulfill the small five-year plan. (Dahui Factory Primary School, Beijing)
    Peking University Opens Persian Language Class
    With the direct help of Soviet experts, China's first Persian language class was established in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University. The class currently has seven students, taught by two Soviet experts, and the students' study period is tentatively set for three years. This is the first time China has trained Persian language translation personnel itself. Persian uses Arabic script and is the national language of Iran. The Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic and the Kingdom of Nepal use this language. (Pan Leng)
    Cultivating Musical Talents of Ethnic Minorities
    In order to cultivate musical talents of ethnic minorities and meet the needs of music undertakings in ethnic minority areas, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music has held a preparatory class for ethnic minority students, absorbing thirteen young people from Uyghur, Korean, Miao, Tibetan, Zhuang, Yi, Xibe, Dong, and other ethnic groups to study in the preparatory class. After one to two years of study, they will transfer to advanced study classes and undergraduate studies respectively.
    After these ethnic minority youths arrived at the school, they received attention and care from the school leaders, who prepared good learning conditions for them. After this stage of study, their results have improved significantly. Comrade Dede, who did not even recognize the staff before, can now sing simple staff notation melodies. Zhuang student Wu Yongcheng had never even seen a piano before entering school, and now he can play simple piano pieces. (Wu Rongfa)
    Labor in the Kitchen
    The Chinese Department of the Huazhong Normal College organized sixty fourth-year students to help the cooks with their work on Sundays. The students who participated in this labor had great enthusiasm. As soon as they entered the kitchen, they peeled carrots, cut vegetables, washed vegetables, washed dishes, and cleaned the dining hall. The most interesting thing was selling vegetables and rice. At first, everyone felt very unfamiliar. How much rice should be given for one cent, and how much should be given for three cents? They couldn't make up their minds. But with the patient guidance of the cooks, they finally learned to master the proportions. They wore work clothes and worked cautiously. One cook even praised, "You are doing very well."
    Through this voluntary labor, everyone realized the hard work of the cooks. In order for everyone to eat dinner, they have to work from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Everyone believes that only by participating in actual labor can they appreciate the glory and greatness of labor.

    在学校里
    实现小五年计划
    北京丰台区大灰厂小学少先队努力争取完成小五年计划。这个小学少先队员们在去年秋后拾粮二千九百六十多斤，还帮助农业社打老玉米五百多亩，打草七万七千五百多斤，共节省农业社四百八十个劳动力。
    现在队员们又盖起了一所能饲养九种动物的“红领巾动物园”，并做了三十多个花盆，进行冬季种植活动。队员们还帮助学校糊了十间教室顶棚，给国家节约了一百多元资金。队员们看到学校烤火煤都堆在后院中，为了不让雨雪淋着，利用课余时间盖起了两间小屋，一个做贮藏室，一个做煤棚。
    队员们还计划建立一个山区少先队小气象站，帮助农民叔叔观测天气。大家表示，一定要争取超额完成小五年计划。　（北京市大灰厂小学）
    北京大学开设波斯语言班
    在苏联专家直接帮助下，我国第一个波斯语言班在北京大学东语系建立。这个班现有学生七人，由两位苏联专家开课，学生学习期限暂定三年。这是我国第一次自己培养波斯语言翻译人材。波斯文习用阿拉伯字母，为伊朗国语。苏联阿塞尔拜疆加盟共和国和尼泊尔王国使用这种语言。　（潘冷）
    培养少数民族音乐人才
    上海音乐学院为了培养少数民族音乐人才，适应少数民族地区音乐事业的需要，举办了少数民族学生预备班，吸收了维吾尔族、朝鲜族、苗族、藏族、僮族、彝族、锡伯族、侗族等十三名各族青年进入预备班学习。他们学习一年到两年后，将分别转入进修班和本科学习。
    这些少数民族青年到校后，受到了学校领导上的重视和照顾，给他们准备了良好的学习条件。经过这一阶段学习后，成绩有显著提高，原来连五线谱也不认识的得朵同学，现在能够唱出简单的五线谱曲调。僮族学生吴永成入学前连钢琴也没见过，现在能弹奏简单的钢琴曲子了。　（吴荣发）
    厨房里的劳动
    华中师范学院中文系团总支组织了四年级六十个同学，利用星期日的时间，帮助炊事员进行工作。参加这次劳动的学生热情很高，他们一进入厨房就削红萝卜、切菜、洗菜、洗碟子、打扫饭厅。最有意思的是卖菜卖饭。开始时大家觉得很生疏，一分钱该给多少饭，三分钱又该给多少？都拿不定主意。但在炊事员的耐心指导下，终于学会了掌握分寸。他们穿着工作服，谨慎地进行工作。一位炊事员还称赞说：“你们干得很好。”
    通过这次义务劳动，大家都体会到炊事员劳动的辛勤。他们为了大家吃一餐晚饭，要从下午两点多钟忙到六点钟。大家认为，只有自己参加了实际劳动，才能体会到劳动的光荣和伟大。
