    Reflections on an Untitled Incident
    Zhong Huai
    In a corner of the newspaper, I occasionally saw the following passage:
      Zhan Yitong, a cadre from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League participating in labor in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, used to be very generous with water in the office. But now, simply because the "water" is carried step by step from the ditch by his own shoulders, he "cherishes water like gold." A little water in the basin, after washing his face in the morning, he is reluctant to pour it out, and keeps it for washing his hands when he returns from the fields at noon and in the evening. Truly: Who knows the water in the basin, each drop is hard-earned.
    If this comrade were still in the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League office today, and only needed to turn on the tap to get water, he wouldn't have this kind of experience, would he?
    I respectfully record this small matter and present it to those who are hesitant about going to the countryside and mountains because of personal "gain" and "loss."

    在报纸的一角，偶尔看到下面的一段：
      在平顺县西沟乡参加劳动的团中央的干部占一同志，以前他在机关用水很大方，可是现在，仅仅因为“水”是由自己肩膀一步一步从沟里挑来的这一点，就“爱水如金”了。盆子里的一点点水，早上洗了脸还舍不得倒，还要留到中午和晚上从地里回来洗手用。真是：谁知盆中水，滴滴皆辛苦。
    如果这个同志今天仍然呆在团中央机关里，要用水，只消拧一下自来水龙头，他是不会有这种体会的吧。
    谨录这样一件小事，赠给那些因为个人的“得”“失”，在下乡上山问题上犹疑不决的人们。
