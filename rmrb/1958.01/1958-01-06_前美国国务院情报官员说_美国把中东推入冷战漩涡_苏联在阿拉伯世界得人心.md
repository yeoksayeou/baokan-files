Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, New York dispatch: Former U.S. State Department intelligence official Charlton Ogburn recently criticized U.S. policy in the Middle East in a conversation with "New York Post" reporter Wallace. He pointed out that this policy is "sharpening local contradictions in the Middle East" and pushing the Middle East into a "Cold War". "If a real war breaks out, the United States should definitely bear most of the responsibility."

Ogburn said that there is currently no form of "Russian aggression" in the Middle East. The governments of Middle Eastern countries simply want to find a force to resist the United States. "They look to the Soviet Union for protection against neighbors that are being supplied with weapons by the United States." He said that the Soviet Union respects neutralism in the Middle East, and it is popular in the Arab world. But "the United States is considered a country colluding with the ruling groups that exploit the Arabs."

Ogburn advocated that the United States accept the Soviet proposal on non-interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. He also said that the United States should respect the Arabs, respect neutralism, and withdraw from the Middle East.

    美国把中东推入冷战漩涡  苏联在阿拉伯世界得人心
    新华社4日讯  纽约消息：前美国国务院情报官员查尔顿·奥格堡最近在同“纽约邮报”记者华莱斯谈话时抨击美国对中东的政策。他指出，这个政策正在使“中东当地的矛盾尖锐化”，并且把中东推入“冷战”。“万一真正发生战争，美国肯定应当负大部分责任。”
    奥格堡说，目前在中东根本不存在任何形式的“俄国侵略”。中东国家政府只是想找一个抵抗美国的力量。“它们指望苏联给以保护，来防备正在由美国供应武器的邻国”。他说，苏联在中东尊重中立主义，它在阿拉伯世界得人心。而“美国却被认为是同剥削阿拉伯人的统治集团相勾结的国家。”
    奥格堡主张美国接受苏联提出的关于不得干涉中东国家内政的建议。他还说，美国应当尊重阿拉伯人、尊重中立主义并且从中东撤退。
