    New York Diary Fragments
    Soviet Writer, F. Kozhevnikov

    "But I want real butter, not this thimble-sized sticky thing wrapped in paper."
    "Are you related to Rockefeller?" the doctor asked sarcastically.
    I couldn't help but get a little angry and said that since the country I had arrived in ranked first in the world in terms of meat, milk, and butter production, shouldn't I be able to satisfy my appetite? I certainly wasn't prepared to be a vegetarian in America.
    The doctor sighed and said in a fatherly voice:
    "You're not wrong. But if you take a look at the average American's plate these days, you'll find that there's still a huge gap between our country's production volume and the consumption power of the vast majority of the people." Then he said with a reproachful tone: "Your TASS journalist friend is unwilling to adapt to the American standard of living. He wants to eat to his heart's content like he's used to in the Soviet Union. As a result, he spends more on food in a month than my whole family does, even though I earn a lot more than he does."
      "So how do you spend your money?"
    "24% goes to rent, and it costs two thousand dollars to send my son to college. On top of that, there are heavy taxes, so there's very little left in 'lean times'."
      "What do you mean by 'lean times'?"
    "Yes," the doctor said, "lean times are what we here call times when 'economic activity declines a bit'."
    Here, I have indeed heard this statement more than once from many Americans, and they always have a look of panic and dejection on their faces when they say this word.
    When I told the doctor about my gloomy impressions of the West Side of New York City, he said in a reproachful tone: "What's wrong with you, friend? This is a very sophisticated area. You can forget about finding a place for less than a hundred dollars a month here." Then he said seriously: "Of course, this forces people to save in other areas."
    "But why do people there drink so heavily?"
    The doctor thought for a moment and replied: "Most of the people who drink are middle-income Americans. Those who experience material difficulties often turn to narcotics." Then, with the calm demeanor of a philosopher, he explained to me that using narcotics is much cheaper than drinking.
    Almost every day I see news in American newspapers about the police fighting with the owners of secret narcotics warehouses. These warehouses have huge stocks, and frankly, you can tell what they're hiding at a glance. But the doctor continued with the philosopher's tone, "Lack of confidence in the future creates a nervous disposition, which is why we rank first in the world in alcohol consumption. As for those with limited incomes, they, of course, can only turn to cheaper items." Then he reproached me, "I think you've exaggerated the number of drunks you saw on the West Side. I believe most of them are not drinking to excess but simply abusing too many narcotics."
      "But you, as a doctor, are talking about this so nonchalantly!"
    The doctor frowned, rubbed his hands, and then pointed to an iron pole used to reinforce a streetlight pole with the words "Public Air Raid Shelter" written on it, explaining, "There were no such signposts during World War II, but now there are many of these things."
      "So do you believe that America will eventually need them one day?"
    The doctor replied listlessly, "The President promised to limit defense spending to $38 billion, but the government's current military spending has exceeded $40 billion. This money is being dug out of our pockets with ever-increasing taxes." Then he said sadly, "Now my son, who is in college, has to drive a bus on Saturdays and Sundays because I can no longer afford his tuition. He's a capable and good kid. If prices rise again, my son won't even be able to become an ordinary engineer, but will only be able to become a good driver." Then the doctor smiled apologetically and said, "You know, now even I don't mind having a small glass of whiskey, which can help you get rid of those tedious thoughts."

    From materials published by the U.S. Census Bureau, I learned that more than 1.5 million New Yorkers living in 250,000 homes do not even have the most basic requirements for human life.
      "Therefore," the New York Herald Tribune wrote, "the city's most terrible slum, covering five thousand acres, is very difficult to completely eliminate, and it is very difficult to erect new buildings on this land."
    The writers of this respectable newspaper merely stated the facts and did not mention that the rent for these slum dwellings is also seventy to eighty dollars a month. No wonder that after sunset, the huge, elegant Central Park of New York has become a place for thousands of homeless people to spend the night. Even New York City Police Commissioner Kennedy himself said at a press conference that the police authorities could not rid the park of these unpaid overnight guests.
    There is currently a popular song in America: "Shoes shined, mood lifted." One day I also wanted to lift my mood, so I stepped on a shoeshiner's wooden box next to the public library on 72nd Street.
    New York's humid and hot climate is very bad for the body. While this middle-aged shoeshiner was shining my shoes, I caught a cold and kept coughing, sniffling, and sneezing.
    Suddenly the shoeshiner raised his head and said uneasily: "This gentleman obviously has a cold. I advise you to go to the pharmacy to buy some medicine!" Then the shoeshiner told me the name of the medicine in the purest Latin.
    "Excuse me, did you cure yourself with this medicine too?" I asked in surprise.
    "No," the shoeshiner said softly, "There was a time when I was a doctor. But due to changes in living conditions, I later switched careers." Then he ordered, "Please extend your foot!"
    When I returned to my respectable doctor, I didn't tell him how I met one of his colleagues... Although my shoes were shiny, my mood did not feel lifted because of it.
    All kinds of dazzling cars with the latest bodywork drive along the streets in an endless stream.
    In some large stores, salespeople huddle by the counters, complaining to customers. A neatly dressed gentleman pulled a discarded newspaper from under a metal trash can and read it carefully.
    But such things no longer surprise me. This person is merely saving five cents, and the people around him do not feel embarrassed by this. People don't even glance at him.
    The steel and concrete spires of skyscrapers rise high into the clouds. I am now on my way to attend a regular meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. On this day, Dulles announced on the podium that for the United States, the main thing is to create a clean hydrogen bomb, and until this bomb is made, the United States will use all its resources to achieve this goal.
    Mr. Dulles supported the interests of American monopoly capital with the enthusiasm of a waiter who solicits customers in a small hotel on Broadway.
    As I gazed at this elderly gentleman, this representative of the American ruling group, I thought of the residents of the West Side of New York and the article in the New York Herald Tribune. The article said that 1.5 million New Yorkers live in slums. To illustrate the situation, the author also described one of the houses: "In a dilapidated kitchen used by thirteen children and fourteen adults, the window glass has long been shattered, and gas is constantly leaking. The walls are full of rat holes. A bathroom used by the same number of people has become a breeding ground for infectious diseases. The air here is suffocating."
    In order to give these Americans living in hardship a little comfort, the people they elected are giving them new and improved atomic bombs as gifts. To manufacture these things, millions of dollars have been taken from the pockets of ordinary Americans through heavier taxes.
    I am now beginning to understand the doctor's anxiety about the future, his thrift in diet, and his worries about the fate of his son as a college student.
    Yes, America's prosperous wealth is only a superficial phenomenon, beneath which lies a very disparate people's lives. Millions of people long for happiness, peace, and clean housing, but their government authorities would rather give them "clean" hydrogen bombs.

    纽约日记片断
    苏联作家　弗·科热夫尼科夫
    “不过我想要一份货真价实的黄油，而不是这块纸包的钮子般的粘东西。”
    “你是洛克菲勒的亲戚吗？”医生讽刺地问我道。
    我不由得有点生气并说道，我所到的国家既然是在肉、奶和牛油的产量方面占世界第一位，难道我想满足一下自己的胃口都不行，我决没有准备在美国做一个素食者。
    医生叹了一口气，并用父亲般的声音说道：
    “你没有错。不过你先看一看现在一般美国人的食盘，那你就会发现我国的产品数量和广大人民的消费能力两者间仍然存在着很大的鸿沟。”接着他又带着责备的口吻说：“你的那位塔斯社记者朋友不愿意适应美国人的生活水平，想按苏联习惯放开肚子地吃，结果他一个月用在吃东西上的钱超过了我们全家的花费，尽管我赚的钱要比他多得多。”
      “那么你怎样花用你的钱呢？”
    “24％付房租，供儿子读大学要花两千美元。此外再加上很重的税，那么在‘惨淡光景’时期就所剩无几了。”
      “惨淡光景是指什么呢？”
    “是的”，医生说道，“惨淡光景就是我们这里所谓的‘经济活动有点下降’的时候。”
    在这里，我的确已不止一次从很多美国人口里听到这一说法，他们在说到这个字眼时脸上总是带着惊慌和颓丧的神色。
    当我向医生讲述我对纽约市西区的阴暗印象的时候，他以责难的口吻说道：“朋友，你是怎么回事，这是很讲究的地区，在这里你休想找到月租在一百元以下的房子。”接着他又严肃地说：“当然，这就使人们不得不在其他方面节省一些。”
    “但是为什么那里的人们那样厉害地酗酒呢？”
    医生想了一想回答说：“喝酒的人多半是中等收入的美国人。而那些感受物质困难的人则常去求助于麻醉品。”接着，他以一种哲学家的安详的神情向我说明，使用麻醉品要比饮酒便宜得多。
    我几乎每天都在美国报纸上看到警察同麻醉品秘密仓库的所有者搏斗的消息。这些仓库有大量的存货，不客气地说，它们一眼就能被人看出是藏的什么货色。但是医生继续带着哲学家的口吻说道，“对于明天缺乏信心造成了一种神经质，这就是我们在酒类消耗方面占世界第一位的原因。至于那些收入有限的人，那么他们当然只有求助于更廉价的物品了。”接着他又责备我道：“我觉得，你把在西区看到的醉汉的人数多少夸大了。我相信，他们中多数人并不是饮酒过度而只是滥用了过多的麻醉品。”
      “不过，您作为一个医生，竟这样满不在乎地谈起这件事！”
    医生皱起了眉、搓搓手，然后指着用以加固路灯柱的一根上面写有“公共防空洞”的铁杆解释道，“在第二次世界大战期中根本没有这类指路标，而现在却很多这类东西。”
      “那么您是否相信有一天美国终会用到它们？”
    医生无精打彩地回答说：“总统答应把国防费限制在三百八十亿这个数字以内，但是政府目前的军费已超过了四百亿。这些钱是用日益提高的赋税从我们口袋中挖走的。”接着他又悲哀地说：“现在我的念大学的儿子已不得不在星期六和星期日去开公共汽车，因为我已越来越付不起他的学费了。他是一个能干的好孩子。如果物价再上涨，我的儿子就连一个普通工程师也当不成，而只能去做一个好的司机了。”于是医生负疚地笑了一下道，“你知道，现在甚至我也不反对来一小杯威士忌，这可以使人摆脱那些无聊的思虑。”
              ×　×　×
    从美国国情普查局公布的材料中，我获悉，住在二十五万所住宅中的一百五十多万纽约人连人类生活最起码的要求都不具备。
      “因此”，“纽约先驱论坛报”写道，“这个城市的占地五千英亩的最可怕的贫民窟是很难全部消灭，在这片土地上是很难立起新建筑物的。”
    这份可尊敬的报纸的撰稿人仅仅叙述了事实，而没有提到这些贫民窟的住宅的租费每月也得七十至八十美元。难怪在日落之后，巨大的、幽雅的纽约中央公园竟成了成千无家可归的人的过夜处。甚至纽约市警察局长肯尼迪先生本人在记者招待会上也说，警察当局无法使这个公园摆脱这些不付钱的过夜者。
    目前美国有一首流行歌曲：“皮鞋擦亮，心境舒畅。”有一天我也很想使心境舒畅一下，于是就在第七十二街的公共图书馆旁，把我的一只脚踏到一个擦鞋人的木箱上。
    纽约的又湿又热的气候对人身体很不好。当这个中年的擦鞋人正在擦亮我的皮鞋的时候，我受了凉，连连咳嗽、流鼻涕、打喷嚏。
    突然擦鞋人抬起了头，不安地说道：“这位先生显然受凉了。我劝你还是去药房买点药吧！”接着这位擦鞋者就以最纯的拉丁语告诉我药的名称。
    “请问，您自己也是用这种药治好的吗？”我惊异地问道。
    “不，”擦鞋人低声说，“从前有个时候，我当过医生。不过由于生活情况的变化，后来改行了。”于是他又命令似地说，“请伸出您的那只脚！”
    我在回到我的那位可尊敬的医生那里的时候，没有告诉他我在怎样的情况下碰见了他的一位同行……虽然我的皮鞋贼亮，但我的心情并没有因而感到舒畅。
    有着最新式的车身的各色各样耀目的汽车沿着街道川流不息地行驶。
    在一些大的商店里，售货员挤在柜台旁向顾客诉苦。一个衣著整洁的绅士模样的人从金属的垃圾箱的下面抽出了一张被人丢掉的报纸，用心地读了起来。
    但是这类事情已不会使我感到惊讶。这个人仅仅是为了节省五分钱，而他身旁的人也并不觉得这有什么难为情。人们甚至连瞧都不瞧他一眼。
    摩天大楼的钢骨水泥的尖顶高耸入云。我现在已经在出发参加联合国大会的例会了。这一天杜勒斯在讲台上宣布说，对于美国，主要的事是制造出一种干净的氢弹，在这种炸弹还没有制成以前，美国将动用它的全部资源来达到这一目的。
    杜勒斯先生以一种百老汇路小酒店的强拉客人的侍者的热情来支持美国垄断资本的利益。
    当我谛视着这个上了年纪的绅士、这个美国统治集团的代表的时候，我想起了纽约西区的居民以及“纽约先驱论坛报”的那篇文章。这篇文章说有一百五十万纽约人住在贫民窟中。为了说明情况，作者还对其中的一所住宅作了描述：“在由十三个孩子和十四个成年人使用的一间破厨房里，窗玻璃早已被打得粉碎，瓦斯经常漏气。墙上到处是鼠洞。由同样数量的人使用的一间洗澡间则成了传染疾病的温床。这里的空气使人窒息。”
    为了使这些艰苦生活的美国人得到一点安慰，他们所选举的人竟把新的更完善的原子弹作为给他们的礼物。为了制造这类东西，曾用更重的税从普通美国人的腰包里挖走了千百万的美元。
    我现在开始懂得了医生对明天的惊惶不安、他在饮食上的克勤克俭以及他对作为大学生的儿子的命运的忧虑。
    是的，美国的繁荣的富裕，这仅是一种表面现象，在这种现象下面有着十分悬殊的人民生活。成百万的人渴望幸福、安宁、清洁的住宅，而他们的政府当局却宁愿给他们“干净的”氢弹。
