Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd – The People's Bank of China, at its recent national branch governors' meeting, determined that the central task of the bank for 1958 is to serve the high tide of industrial and agricultural production by doing a good job in financial work.

The meeting considered that vigorously developing urban and rural people's savings work and widely mobilizing mass funds are important methods for promoting the development of national construction. Therefore, it is required to adhere to the principles of "voluntary deposit, free withdrawal, and confidentiality for depositors," and strive to complete the urban and rural savings tasks for 1958.

The meeting determined that rural financial work in 1958 should serve the high tide of agricultural production. The current national agricultural loan quota has reached 4.4 billion yuan, and the increase in the future will not be large. At the same time, the potential of rural funds is very large. Therefore, the policy of rural financial work should be: rationally allocate and fully utilize existing agricultural loan funds, and actively organize rural funds to support the development of agricultural production. In order to better exert the role of agricultural loans, the meeting believes that the management of agricultural loan funds in the future should be the responsibility of the local party and government on how to use the loans, while adhering to the principle of borrowing and repaying, and reasonable turnover.

When discussing industrial and commercial credit work, the meeting believed that, according to national needs, the bank's task of managing national working capital through handling credit work for socialist enterprises will become increasingly heavy. In order to gradually realize this task, starting from 1958, the bank will begin to handle fixed-amount loans, using loans to participate in the fixed quota of industrial working capital and the capital quota of basic-level stores.

    为工农业生产高潮服务
    人民银行行长会议确定1958年中心任务
    据新华社2日讯　中国人民银行在最近召开的全国分行行长会议上，确定1958年银行的中心任务，是通过做好金融工作，为工农业生产高潮服务。
    会议认为大力开展城乡人民储蓄工作，广泛动员群众资金，是推进国家建设事业发展的重要方法之一。因此要求坚持“存款自愿、取款自由、为存户保密”的原则，努力完成1958年的城乡储蓄任务。
    会议确定1958年的农村金融工作应当为农业生产高潮服务。目前国家农贷指标已达四十四亿元，今后增加的数字不会多，同时农村资金潜力很大，因此农村金融工作的方针应当是：合理分配和充分运用现有农贷资金，积极组织农村资金，以扶持农业生产的发展。为了更好地发挥农贷的作用，会议认为今后农贷资金的管理，应当在坚持有借有还、合理周转的原则下，贷款如何使用，由地方党政负责。
    会议在讨论工商业信贷工作时，认为根据国家需要，银行通过办理社会主义企业的信贷工作所担负的管理国家流动资金的任务，将日益加重。为了逐步实现这个任务，从1958年起银行开始办理定额贷款，以贷款参加工业流动资金定额和基层商店的资金定额。
