Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidam, 25th: A great leap forward in agricultural production is being organized in various state-owned farms in the Qaidam Basin. In what was previously considered barren Gobi desert, despite the freezing weather, carts carrying manure are still moving back and forth in an endless stream. The eight farms in Delingha, Golmud, and others have accumulated over 260 million jin of fertilizer. The fourth and seventh work stations of the Delingha Farm have stored enough fertilizer to guarantee 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of wheat, fifteen times more than last year. The second production team of the Mahai Farm mobilized its workers to find fertilizer sources everywhere, and as a result, they found more than 30 old sheepfolds in one day, containing more than 2 million jin of sheep manure. Currently, people can be seen breaking ice and digging ditches everywhere in the Qaidam Basin. More than 1,000 people from the Mahai Farm are participating in breaking ice and digging ditches. Last year, the Nuomuhong Farm could only irrigate more than 22,000 mu of land. After renovating the canals, searching for water sources, and implementing planned water use, it can now guarantee irrigation for 32,000 mu. More than 2,000 cadres and workers in the Da Qaidam area are braving the severe cold to rush-repair a 6.72-kilometer-long canal, with a depth and width of about one meter or more, striving to use it for irrigation in time.

This year, the cultivated area of various state-owned farms in the Qaidam Basin will increase from more than 140,000 mu last year to 200,000 mu. The total grain output will increase from more than 32 million jin last year to more than 67 million jin. The vegetable supply will progress from self-sufficiency in several coarse vegetables to complete self-sufficiency in fine vegetables. These leap forward targets were formulated by grassroots units such as work stations and production teams of various farms after repeated discussions and continuous criticism of conservative thinking.

From mid-December last year to January this year, the Qaidam Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized three work groups to go to various farms to understand the actual situation of organizing the production leap forward. They found that the work station chiefs of various farms generally believed that last year's bumper harvest was hard-won, and a 10% increase this year would already be a significant achievement, and that further increasing production targets would be difficult. Some work stations that had already achieved relatively high bumper harvests also believed that the natural conditions in the Qaidam Basin were poor, and even a slight increase in production would be good enough. In response to these right-leaning conservative ideas, the Qaidam Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized large-scale debates among the responsible cadres of the farms, as well as in the work stations and production teams, mobilizing the masses to tap potential and find solutions. It also pointed out that although the Qaidam Basin has many unfavorable factors for agricultural production, it also has many favorable aspects. First of all, the construction of irrigation canals has been completed in five farms, including Delingha, Golmud, and Nuomuhong. Other farms have also built simple and convenient canals, and now 130,000 mu of land can be guaranteed to be irrigated. This year, the irrigation area will be expanded by more than 60,000 mu. Over the years, the number of livestock such as pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses on the basin farms has also greatly increased, and the amount of fertilizer has also increased accordingly. Last year, inexhaustible peat fertilizer sources were also discovered in the vicinity of Mahai, Golmud, and other farms, which provided favorable conditions for the agricultural production leap forward. Over the past four years, some practical experience has been accumulated in cultivating crops in high-altitude, arid areas in the Qaidam Basin, and a large number of junior agricultural technicians who have initially mastered crop cultivation techniques in the basin have been trained. Various farms also have a considerable foundation and possess some mechanical agricultural implements and other equipment, which also provide a reliable guarantee for the production leap forward.

    柴达木盆地农业生产将有大跃进
    粮食比去年提高一倍  细菜做到全部自给
    据新华社大柴旦25日电　柴达木盆地各个国营农场正在组织农业生产大跃进。在过去认为荒凉的戈壁滩上，尽管目前是天寒地冻的日子，积肥送粪的大车仍然络绎不绝。德令哈，噶尔穆等八个农场已经积肥两亿六千多万斤。德令哈农场第四、第七作业站积储的肥料已能保证每亩小麦施肥一万斤的计划，比去年积的肥料多了十五倍。马海农场第二生产队发动职工四处找肥源，结果一天内就找到三十多个老羊圈，共有羊粪两百多万斤。目前在柴达木盆地的各个渠道上，到处可以看到人们在破冰掏渠，马海农场参加破冰掏渠的就达一千多人。诺木洪农场去年只能灌二万二千多亩地，经过整理渠道，找寻水源，实行计划用水，目前可以保证灌溉三万二千亩。大柴旦地区的两千多名干部职工，正冒着凛冽的寒风抢修一条长六点七二公里、深宽约一公尺以上的水渠，争取能及时用来灌溉。
    今年，柴达木盆地各个国营农场的耕地面积将由去年的十四万多亩增加到二十万亩，粮食总产量将由去年的三千二百多万斤提高到六千七百多万斤，蔬菜将由原来的几种粗菜自给达到细菜也能全部自给。这些跃进的指标是由各个农场的作业站、生产队等基层单位经过反复讨论不断批判保守思想后制定出来的。
    中共柴达木工作委员会在去年12月中旬到今年1月组织了三个工作组，分赴各农场了解组织生产跃进的实际情况，发现各农场的作业站长比较普遍地认为去年丰产来得不易，今年增加10％已是一个不小的进展，再提高生产指标有困难；有些已经取得较高额丰产的作业站，也认为柴达木盆地自然条件差，能略有增产已不错了。针对这些右倾保守思想，中共柴达木工委在农场的负责干部中，在作业站和生产队中组织了大辩论，发动群众挖潜力，找窍门；并指出柴达木盆地虽有不少对农业生产不利的因素，但它的有利方面是很多的。首先在德令哈、噶尔穆、诺木洪等五个农场已完成灌溉渠道的修建工程，其他几个农场也修了简易便渠，现已有十三万亩土地能保证得到灌溉。今年还将扩大灌溉面积六万多亩。连年盆地农场的猪、羊、牛、马等牲畜也有了很大的发展，肥料也有了相应的增加。去年在马海、噶尔穆等农场邻近地区还发现了有取之不尽的泥炭肥源，这都为农业生产跃进提供了有利条件。四年来在柴达木盆地还积累了一些在高寒、干旱地区耕作的实际经验，并培养了大批已初步掌握盆地作物栽培技术的初级农业技术员。各个农场也都具有相当的基础，并拥有部分机械农具等设备，这也为生产跃进提供了可靠的保证。
