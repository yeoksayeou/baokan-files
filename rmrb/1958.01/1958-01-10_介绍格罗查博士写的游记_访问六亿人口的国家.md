Introducing Dr. Groza's Travelogue "Visiting a Country of Six Hundred Million People"
In the autumn of 1954, Dr. Petru Groza was invited by Chairman Mao Zedong to pay a friendly visit to our country for more than a month. After returning to his country, Dr. Groza wrote a book about his impressions during his visit to China, entitled "Visiting a Country of Six Hundred Million People," which was published by the Romanian State Publishing House for Literature and Art in 1957.

In this book of more than 300 pages, Dr. Groza enthusiastically describes his observations and experiences during his visits to various places in China, and praises the selfless labor of the Chinese people in building socialism, and their love and support for the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. In this book, the author also describes some of China's cities, rural areas, economic enterprises, construction projects, cultural institutions, and places of scenic and historical interest, and introduces China's culture and art with its long historical tradition and unique national style.

Because this travelogue has rich content and vivid descriptions, it is welcomed by the majority of readers in Romania.
