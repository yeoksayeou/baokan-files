Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch:  In the past two months, farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, braving the cold wind and drizzle, have overfulfilled the winter afforestation task by 55.3%.  The responsibility system of contracted planting, guaranteed survival, guaranteed tending, and guaranteed afforestation has been widely implemented in various places, resulting in a general improvement in the quality of afforestation compared with previous years.

The rapid progress, high enthusiasm, and good quality of winter afforestation in this province are mainly due to the fact that relevant leading departments at all levels have strengthened their leadership over greening work while carrying out the winter production campaign centered on farmland water conservancy construction.  Since November of last year, various places have successively established greening committees or afforestation headquarters, with the deputy secretaries of the CPC prefectural committees, deputy commissioners, heads of autonomous prefectures, and county heads serving as directors or commanders, personally leading afforestation, which has greatly encouraged the masses.  The county party secretaries of Jinsha and Zhijin counties also led hundreds of cadres from organs and teachers and students from schools to the mountains to carry out afforestation demonstrations.

Unifying the planning of afforestation work with other winter production activities is also one of the important reasons for the rapid and successful development of the afforestation movement.  In some counties of the Bijie Special Zone, many agricultural cooperatives have arranged for 10% to 20% of their labor force to be specifically responsible for greening and afforestation.  In most agricultural cooperatives in Fuquan, Anshun, and other counties in the Anshun Special Zone, afforestation assault weeks and assault days were stipulated, and about 30% of the labor force was drawn out to carry out afforestation assaults.

    贵州山区超额完成冬季造林任务
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州山区各族农民最近两个月来，冒着寒风细雨，超额55.3％完成了冬季造林任务。各地广泛推行包栽、包活、包抚育、包成林的责任制度，使造林质量普遍比往年提高。
    这个省冬季造林进度快、劲头高、质量好的原因，主要是各级有关领导部门在开展以兴修农田水利为中心的冬季生产运动中，加强了对绿化工作的领导。从去年11月份以来，各地先后建立了绿化委员会或造林指挥部，中共地委副书记、正副专员、州长和县长分别担任主任委员或指挥长，亲自领导造林，给群众很大鼓舞。金沙、织金等县的县委书记，还带领几百名机关干部和学校师生，上山进行造林示范。
    把造林工作和其他各项冬季生产统一规划，也是使造林运动开展较快、较好的重要原因之一。毕节专区部分县的许多农业社，安排了10％到20％的劳力专门负责绿化造林。安顺专区福泉、安顺等县多数农业社，规定了造林突击周、突击日，抽出30％左右的劳力突击造林。
