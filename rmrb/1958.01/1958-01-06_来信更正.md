    Letter of Correction

    To the Editors:
    In the article "Blind People Actively Participate in Production, Breaking Away from a Life of Wandering and Begging" published on the fourth page of your newspaper on November 27th of last year, the statement "Out of the 1.5 to 1.6 million blind people in the country, only one in a thousand is currently participating in production" was an error in our original manuscript. This is because the majority of the 1.5 to 1.6 million blind people nationwide are in rural areas. The article only discussed the participation of urban blind people, and did not include the participation of rural blind people in production. We haven't yet grasped the situation of rural blind people participating in production, so such a calculation is not realistic. Please correct this.

    来信更正编辑同志：
    去年11月27日您报四版刊登的“摆脱流浪、乞讨的生活，盲人积极参加生产”一文中“全国盲人约一百五、六十万，现在参加生产的不过千分之一”，这是我们当时稿件中的错误。因为全国一百五、六十万盲人，大部分在农村，该文所述都是城市盲人参加的事实，没有包括农村盲人参加生产的情况，因农村盲人参加生产的情况我们还没有掌握，这样的算法是不合实际的。请予更正。
