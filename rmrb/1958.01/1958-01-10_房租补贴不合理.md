    Unreasonable Housing Subsidy

    I am a staff member engaged in labor protection and welfare work. I feel that some current welfare systems are not reasonable, which not only increases the expenses of enterprises but also affects the work enthusiasm of employees. Here, I will only cite the actual results of implementing the housing subsidy system to illustrate this problem.

    The system of enterprises providing subsidies to employees of Beijing commercial enterprises who rent private houses and houses from the Housing Management Bureau was implemented in July 1956. Among the more than 20,000 employees of enterprises under the Beijing Commercial Bureau, more than 8,500 people enjoy this subsidy. Generally, they receive eight or nine yuan per month, and the most receive eighteen yuan, which is equivalent to a one- or two-grade salary increase. The annual expenditure of enterprises on housing subsidies amounts to more than 330,000 yuan. According to the survey, among the employees receiving housing subsidies, only more than 1,100 people have different degrees of financial difficulties and need enterprises to help solve part or all of their rent; the remaining more than 7,400 people have the ability to bear all the rent and do not need subsidies at all. Tian Min of the No. 3 Sales Department of the Beijing Department Store, both husband and wife have jobs, with a monthly salary income of more than 100 yuan, and only one child, still receives a housing subsidy of 9.1 yuan per month. Due to this system, some employees are prompted to rent houses with good structure and large space regardless of the rent, which increases the burden on enterprises. Liu Qichao of the Municipal Chemical Raw Materials Company originally lived in a house with a rent of seven yuan. After the implementation of the housing subsidy, he actively looked for a good house and moved into a house with a monthly rent of eighteen yuan in January last year. Such things are not isolated cases. Some employees whose families are not in this city have actively rented houses and brought their families since the implementation of the housing subsidy system. In the No. 3 Sales Department of the Department Store alone, 20 people have moved their families from the countryside to the city, which has increased the tension in urban housing. Because of these shortcomings, employees have many opinions. Many employees have proposed opinions on improving or abolishing this system.

    Based on the above situation, I believe that the state should consider it as a whole and improve this unreasonable system through this rectification campaign.

### 房租补贴不合理

    房租补贴不合理
    我是一个作劳保福利工作的工作人员，我觉得目前有些福利制度不够合理，不仅增加了企业的开支，还影响到职工的工作积极性。这里，我只举出实行房租补贴制度的实际结果来说明这个问题。
    北京市商业企业职工租用私房和房管局房屋，企业给予补贴的制度，是1956年7月开始实行的。市商业局所属各级企业的二万多职工中，有八千五百多人享受这项补贴。一般是每月拿八、九元，最多的拿十八元，等于升一级到二级。企业每年支出房租补贴费达三十三万多元。据调查，在领房贴的职工中只有一千一百多人生活上有不同程度的困难，需要企业帮助解决一部或全部房租；其余七千四百多人都有负担全部房租的能力，根本不需要补助。市百货公司第三门市部田敏，夫妇都有工作，每月工资收入一百多元，只有一个小孩，每月还拿到房租补贴九元一角。由于有了这个制度，促使了一些职工不管租金高低，抢租结构好、间量大的房屋，加大了企业的负担。市化工原料公司刘起超原住着七元租金的房子，实行房租补贴以后，就积极找好房，在去年1月搬进了每月十八元租金的房舍。这样的事并不是个别的。也有些家属不在本市的职工，自从实行房租补贴的制度后，就积极的租房子，接家属来。仅百货公司第三门市部一个单位，就有二十人把家属从农村搬进城来，增加了城市住房紧张。因为有上述这些缺点，所以职工们的意见很多。不少职工提出了改进或取消这个制度的意见。
    根据以上情况，我认为国家应该统一考虑，通过这次整风，改进这个不合理的制度。
