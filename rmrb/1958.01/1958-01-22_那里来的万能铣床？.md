    Where Did the Universal Milling Machine Come From?
    On November 27th last year, the Jiamusi Agricultural Economics School suddenly received a universal milling machine sent from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. Strange! The school did not order this machine from the factory, so what happened? It turned out that the factory mistakenly sent the milling machine destined for the South China State Farms General Bureau in Guangzhou to the school.
    Due to this milling machine blindly going back and forth between the South and the North, not counting the loss of production caused by the delay, the freight costs alone wasted more than three thousand yuan.

    那里来的万能铣床？
    去年11月27日，佳木斯农业经济学校突然接到从北京第一机床厂发来的一台万能铣床。奇怪！学校并没有向这个厂订货，是怎么一回事呢？原来是这个厂把发到广州华南农垦总局的铣床，错发到学校来了。
    由于这台铣床盲目的南来北往，不算耽误生产的损失，单运费就浪费了三千多元。
