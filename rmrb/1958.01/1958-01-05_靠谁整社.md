Who to Rely on to Rectify the Cooperative
Hui Zhi

“In the leadership composition of cooperatives, maintain the advantage of the original poor and lower-middle peasants (mainly the current poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants), and at the same time pay attention to ensuring that the upper-middle peasants also have appropriate representation.” This is the first condition stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for consolidating cooperatives. This is also the Party's class policy in rural areas. It was precisely by implementing this policy that the great victory of agricultural cooperativization was quickly achieved in the spring of 1956. Over the past two years, cooperatives have been relatively consolidated and continuously improved in places that have adhered to this policy. In the rural rectification movement, significant results have been achieved wherever this policy has been followed. It must not be assumed that the lines between the various classes and strata in rural areas no longer exist after the realization of advanced cooperativization.

In Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, 56% of the original team leaders of the Qunxing Cooperative were upper-middle peasants. As a result, this cooperative had many problems in grasping the direction and implementing management policies and Party policies. After the most recent rectification, the leadership composition was adjusted, reducing the proportion of upper-middle peasants in the leadership to about 30%, and the cooperative became relatively consolidated. When the members of the Baimiao Village Cooperative in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, discussed the qualifications of cadres, the well-to-do middle peasants proposed that it was enough to have a democratic work style and be fair in handling affairs. The poor peasants disagreed, believing that these two points were not enough and that "progressive thinking, resolutely following the socialist road; active work, conscientiously implementing policies" should be added. This shows that although the upper-middle peasants are also working people, they often waver between the socialist and capitalist roads due to their relatively better living conditions; the most resolute in following the socialist road are the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Some people believe that the class policy is no problem to implement in general cooperatives, but it may not work in backward cooperatives. It is probably said that backward cooperatives are all backward, and even the reliable majority of the masses is gone. The fact is not like this. The situation in backward cooperatives is of course much more complicated than in general cooperatives. Here, there are both contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, both existing simultaneously and intertwined. To rectify backward cooperatives, we must first use the method of class analysis to distinguish the nature of the problem, so that it is easy to treat them separately. To do this, we must rely on the basic masses. Are the majority of the masses in backward cooperatives reliable? The answer is yes. Some backward cooperatives seem smoky and impossible to clean up. In fact, only a few bad elements are making waves, plus some well-to-do middle peasants who are cheering them on. The broad masses are in a state of being confused and suppressed, and justice cannot be upheld. As long as we can implement the class policy well, follow the mass line, mobilize, educate, and rely on the basic masses and their backbone, and organize the class ranks, the work will start smoothly immediately.

Some cadres, in the rectification of cooperatives, were afraid of "offending" the well-to-do middle peasants and did not dare to publicly promote and implement the class policy, which also caused losses to the work. The aforementioned Qunxing Cooperative took a detour in the re-election of cadres. The comrades of the work team believed that after the great debate and the rectification of the Party and the cooperative, the awareness of the masses had been raised, and the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants was no longer a problem. Therefore, they neither publicized the class policy nor paid attention to mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants. As a result, the well-to-do middle peasants gained an advantage. Although a lot of work was done later to reverse this situation, many detours had already been taken. This is a lesson that should be remembered.

    靠谁整社

    “在合作社的领导成份中，保持原来的贫雇农和下中农（主要是现在的贫农和新中农中间的下中农）的优势，同时注意使上中农也有适当的代表。”这是农业发展纲要（修正草案）第一条中规定的巩固合作社的第一个条件。这也就是党在农村中的阶级政策。正是由于贯彻执行了这个政策，1956年春天很快地取得了农业合作化的大胜利。两年来，凡是坚持执行这个政策的地方，合作社都是比较巩固而且不断提高的。在农村的整风运动中，凡是按照这个政策办事的，又都收到了显著的效果。决不可以认为，实现高级合作化以后农村各阶级各阶层之间的界线已经不再存在了。
    福建晋江县群星社原来的小队长有56％是上中农担任的，因而这个社在方向的掌握上、在贯彻经营方针和党的政策上，都发生过不少问题。经过最近一次整社，调整了领导成份，使上中农在领导人员中的比例降低到30％左右，合作社才比较巩固了。河北行唐县白庙村社员讨论干部条件时，富裕中农提出：只要作风民主、办事公道就行。贫农不同意，他们认为：光这两条不行，还必须加上“思想进步，坚决走社会主义道路；工作积极，认真执行政策”这两条。由此可见，上中农虽然也是劳动人民，但由于生活条件比较优越，经常动摇在社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间；走社会主义道路最坚决的还是贫农和下中农。
    有人认为：阶级政策在一般社执行起来没问题，但在落后社怕就不行了。大概是说落后社一切落后，连可依靠的群众多数也没有了。事实并不是这样的。落后社的情况比一般社当然复杂得多，这里既有人民内部矛盾，又有敌我矛盾，两者同时并存，互相交错。整顿落后社首先要用阶级分析的方法分清问题性质，而后才便于分别对待。要做到这点，就非依靠基本群众不行。落后社的大多数群众是不是可依靠的呢？肯定是的。有些落后社表面看来乌烟瘴气，好像是不可收拾了。实际上兴风作浪的只是少数坏分子，再加上一些摇旗呐喊的富裕中农。而广大基本群众则处于被迷惑被压制的状态，正气不得伸张。只要我们能很好地执行阶级政策，走群众路线，发动、教育并依靠基本群众及其骨干分子，组织起阶级队伍，工作马上便会顺利展开。
    有些干部在整社中，怕“得罪”了富裕中农，不敢公开宣传和贯彻执行阶级政策，结果也使工作遭到损失。前面提到的群星社在改选干部中就走了一次弯路。工作组同志认为经过大辩论和整党整社，群众觉悟已经提高，贫农和下中农的领导优势已经没问题了。因此，他们既不宣传阶级政策，也不注意发动贫农、下中农。结果，富裕中农反而占了优势。虽然后来做了许多工作，扭转了这个局面；但已经走了不少弯路。这是应该记取的教训。
