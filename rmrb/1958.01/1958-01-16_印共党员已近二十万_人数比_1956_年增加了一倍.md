    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 15th: According to the Indian News Agency, the membership of the Indian Communist Party has now increased to nearly 200,000, almost double the number at the time of the Fourth Congress of the Indian Communist Party in April 1956. At that time, the membership was over 100,000.

    The report says that the movement to develop party membership is expected to reach a climax by the end of March this year, when the Indian Communist Party's state conferences conclude.

    Compared with the membership in 1956, the membership in West Bengal has more than doubled, from 10,775 at that time to more than 22,000 at present; in Andhra, it has increased from 28,000 to 49,000; in Tamil Nadu (Madras), it has increased from 7,700 to 20,000; and in Uttar Pradesh, it has increased from 5,600 to 12,000. Materials from other states, including Kerala, have not yet been obtained because the Communist Party congresses in these states have not yet been convened.

    印共党员已近二十万
    人数比1956年增加了一倍
    新华社新德里15日电　据印度新闻社报道，印度共产党的党员人数现在已经增加到将近二十万，比1956年4月印度共产党举行第四次代表大会的时候差不多增加了一倍。那时候的党员人数为十万多。
    消息说，预期到今年3月底印度共产党各邦会议结束的时候，发展党员的运动将达到高潮。
    同1956年的党员人数比较，目前西孟加拉邦的党员已经增加一倍多，即从当时的一万零七百七十五人增加到目前的二万二千多人；在安得拉，已经从二万八千人增加到四万九千人；在泰米尔纳德（马德拉斯），已经从七千七百人增加到两万人；在北方邦，已经从五千六百人增加到一万二千人。包括喀拉拉邦在内的其他各邦的材料现在还没有得到，因为这些邦的共产党代表会议还没有召开。
