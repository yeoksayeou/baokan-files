    Differentiated Treatment
    Zeng Zhi
    Streamlining institutions and transferring personnel to lower levels is a very complex and meticulous task. Its complexity and meticulousness mainly lie in the arrangement and handling of people. As far as we understand, there are two different approaches to arranging and handling personnel for retirement, resignation, job transfer, and transfer for labor training. One approach is that the leadership first fully understands and considers all aspects of each cadre's situation: work ability, education level, expertise, health, and family situation, and then makes different arrangements and handles them differently according to their specific situations. Those who should be sent to lower levels for labor training are sent down in batches according to the principle of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training." Those comrades who have lost the conditions for work and should retire are patiently persuaded and mobilized to retire and return home to enjoy their old age, or resign and return home to engage in housework, starting from the overall interests of the country. For some people who are not suitable for working in this institution but can still work in other institutions or engage in other social work, we should try our best to find job opportunities for them so that they can be placed in suitable positions. In handling these matters, we must never mobilize people who can be sent to lower levels for training to resign and return home, nor can we send people who should retire to lower levels for labor training. Even for those who should be sent to lower levels for labor training, we should give as much consideration as possible to their expertise and specific circumstances and handle them differently. Many units of central government institutions have adopted this differentiated approach in the work of "streamlining institutions and transferring personnel to lower levels." The Ministry of Culture not only adopted a differentiated approach to literary and art workers but also conducted multiple reviews of those who had already decided to go to the countryside for labor. The purpose of the review was to prevent people who should not go down from going down. Because they adopted this attitude, before the first batch of personnel set off, they found that some units had sent down personnel who should not have been sent down. Therefore, the Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group resolutely retained these people and re-handled them according to their different situations. The Railway Department sent personnel to lower levels, combining their expertise as much as possible, to suitable positions for labor training or to work at the grassroots level. And they also took care of the special circumstances and difficulties of some comrades whenever possible.

    However, the approach of some units is just the opposite of what has been said above. They regard the arrangement and handling of people as too simplistic. They only proceed from the task of reducing personnel, and rarely consider and understand the situation of each person, and rarely consider how to handle and arrange them most appropriately so that they can be placed in suitable positions. They only consider the work and personnel situation of their own units, and do not consider the overall national construction situation. Therefore, in handling these matters, it is very likely that those who should be sent to lower levels for labor training are not sent down, and those who should retire are sent down; or although they are not suitable for working in this unit, they can still work in other units, but they are also mobilized to resign and retire, and other improper handling phenomena occur. A certain ministry in the central government has a high quality and large number of cadres, and this time it needs to reduce a lot of staff. However, they did not handle this issue responsibly. In addition to sending some people to the grassroots level and to the countryside for labor training, they also mobilized many people to resign and retire. Among them, there are some comrades who have not yet lost the conditions for work and can still serve socialist construction. Similar situations have occurred in other regions. This approach of simply handling matters without distinguishing different situations and without considering the staff is rare, but it is worth paying attention to. Because this approach violates the spirit of being responsible for the staff to the end, and it also violates the overall and long-term interests of the country.

    区别对待

    紧缩机构、人员下放是一件十分复杂、细致的工作。说它复杂、细致，主要是指对人的安排和处理而言。如何安排和处理退休、退职、调换工作和下放劳动锻炼的人员，根据我们的了解，有两种不同的作法。一种作法是领导上首先充分了解和考虑了每个干部的各方面情况：工作能力、文化水平、有无专长、身体和家庭情况等等，然后再根据不同情况作不同的安排和处理。凡是应该下放劳动锻炼的，就根据“统一安排、全面锻炼”的原则，分期分批地放下去劳动锻炼；凡是丧失了工作条件，应该退职退休的同志，就耐心地说服动员他们从国家的整体利益出发，退休回去养老，或者退职回家从事家务劳动。对于一部分虽然不适合在本机关工作，但仍然可以在别的机关工作或者可以从事其他社会工作的人，尽量想办法为他们找寻工作出路，使之各得其所。在处理的时候，决不能把可以下放锻炼的人动员退职回家，也决不能把应该退职退休的人下放劳动锻炼。就是对于应该下放劳动锻炼的人，也尽可能地照顾到他们的专长和具体情况，作不同的处理。中央国家机关许多单位在这次“紧缩机构、人员下放”的工作中，都采取了这种区别对待的作法。文化部不仅对文学艺术人员采取了分别对待的办法，而且对已经决定下放到农村去劳动的人员，也进行多次的审查。审查目的，就是不让不应下去的人下去。正因为他们采取了这个态度，第一批下放人员临出发前，还发现有些单位把不应该下放的人员下放了，于是部的整风领导小组坚决把这些人留了下来，按照不同情况重新处理。铁道部下放人员，尽可能地结合了各人的专长放到合适的岗位上去劳动锻炼，或者到基层担任工作。并且还在可能条件下照顾某些同志的特殊情况和困难。
    也有些单位的作法，和上面所说的恰恰相反。他们把对人的安排、处理看得过于简单化了，他们只是从完成减少人员的任务出发，而很少考虑和了解每个人的情况，很少考虑应该怎样处理、安排他们才最合适，才能使他们各得其所。他们只考虑本单位的工作情况和人员情况，而不考虑整个国家建设情况。因此，在处理的时候，就很可能发生应该下放劳动锻炼的没有下放，应该退职退休的下放了；或者虽然不适合在本单位工作但还可以在别的单位工作的人，也动员退职退休等等处理不当的现象。中央有一个部，干部质量较高，数量又多，这次需要减少很多工作人员，但是他们没有认真负责地处理这个问题，除下放了一部分人到基层、到农村去劳动锻炼以外，还动员了不少的人退职退休。当中，就有一些人是还没有丧失工作条件，还可以为社会主义建设服务的同志。其他地区也发生了类似情况。这种不区别不同情况、不多为工作人员着想就简单地进行处理的作法，虽然是极少数，但却是值得引起注意的。因为这种作法违反了对工作人员负责到底的精神，也违反了国家的整体和长远利益。
