Notes

    Wonderful "Bridge" Role
    Philippine Acting Foreign Minister Serrano recently said at a gathering that the Philippines' role in international relations is as a "bridge between East and West."
    The East and West that Serrano refers to are the Asian countries that recently broke free or are in the process of breaking free from the Western colonial shackles, and those Western countries that are still trying to re-impose colonial shackles on the heads of Asians.
    In order to play the "bridge" role he spoke of, Serrano in his speech urged Asians "to eliminate hatred of the West," but did not ask Westerners to abandon their colonialism.
    It turns out that the Philippines' "bridge" is just a one-way street to guide Asians into the embrace of Western colonialism.
    Wonderful! "Bridge" role.

### 妙哉“桥梁”作用

    妙哉“桥梁”作用
    菲律宾代理外长塞兰诺最近在一次集会上说，菲律宾在国际关系中的作用就是“东西方之间的桥梁”。
    塞兰诺所说的东西方，是指不久前才挣脱或正在挣脱西方殖民锁链的亚洲国家，和那些还力图把殖民锁链重新加在亚洲人头上的西方国家。
    为了起他所说的“桥梁”作用，塞兰诺在演说中竭力敦促亚洲人“要消除对西方的仇恨”，但是却没有要求西方人放弃他们的殖民主义。
    原来菲律宾这个“桥梁”只是要把亚洲人引导到西方的殖民主义的怀抱中去的一股单行道。
    妙哉！“桥梁”作用。
