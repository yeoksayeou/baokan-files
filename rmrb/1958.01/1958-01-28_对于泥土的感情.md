    Feelings for the Soil
    Jiang Xianfan, Dongzha Township Agricultural Cooperative, Tianjin
    Although I have only been participating in agricultural labor in the countryside for a little over a month, my understanding and feelings towards the soil have changed dramatically.
    Previously, as a "three-door" cadre (out of the family door, into the school door, and then into the office door), I was unfamiliar with the soil. I rarely saw soil throughout the year. I walked on asphalt roads and cement paths, and lived in buildings with a mixed structure of cement, brick, and wood. Although the foundations underneath were all soil, there was still a layer separating me, so I couldn't directly face the soil. White rice, white flour, chives, and scallions were fragrant when placed on the table and eaten, and I could distinguish them. However, I was not clear about what the five grains and vegetables looked like growing in the soil. It was difficult to find any direct relationship with the soil. Thinking carefully, there were still some. For example, someone would suddenly shout, "Hey, hey, there's a piece of mud on your face!" "What, what! Where, where?" I would ask anxiously, reaching out to touch it and taking out a handkerchief to wipe it off. Another example was that there were two brushes in the bedroom, one with a mirror attached to the handle, specifically for brushing the soil off the bed, and another with a small rope for hanging on the wall, specifically for brushing the soil off the clothes. So, from early morning to late at night, all you could hear was the sound of "brush, brush, brush" brushing off the soil.
    In short, in the actual life of urban intellectuals, soil was such an unfamiliar and even repulsive thing. It seemed useless, and there was no talk of having any feelings for it.
    After going to the countryside, the situation completely changed. Only then did it seem like I had truly become a person growing on the land. Every step you took was on solid ground. The house you lived in was made of mud, and you even helped the old men mix mud and build the kang (heated brick bed) and build the stove. As for labor, whether it was turning the soil, carrying mud, or digging ditches to fill the river, every lift of your leg and every swing of your arm was part of the great struggle to conquer the soil.
    During labor, I naturally and gradually began to care about the soil. When I woke up in the middle of the night and heard the wind howling, I would wonder in my blanket whether the soil would freeze and whether it would still be possible to use the hoe. When I saw the black, oily silt carried up from the river and accumulated in the fields, I would ask in the local dialect, "Old man, is this soil 'strong'?" "Timely snow promises a good harvest" was originally an idiom that I had memorized in my childhood, but in the past, whenever it snowed, I didn't have that sense of joy. Only now, after the first two snowfalls, when the villagers said it was good snow, I also felt joy from the bottom of my heart. Looking at the agricultural cooperative's vast white fields, I imagined a golden world of abundant harvests in front of me, like every farmer: heavy rice swaying in the wind, wheat, fist-sized cotton bolls, and sorghum ears as thick as horsetails.
    Originally, labor on the land is the labor of five hundred million out of the six hundred million people in our country, and it feeds everyone. In the hearts of the working people, soil is precious and亲可亲. However, intellectuals do not share the same feelings as the masses. I remember that there are often such scenes and situations in movies and novels: farmers kissing the land, and soldiers on expeditions treasuring a handful of soil from their hometowns. In the past, I couldn't understand why I had to do that with black mud. Recently, I have gained a little understanding of the deep and profound meaning in it. Truly, pitiful intellectuals! If they don't go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, they will even have difficulty understanding the feelings of the workers and peasants depicted by writers!
    In fact, being far away from the land is also being far away from the working people. Being unfamiliar with the soil and having no feelings for the soil is also being unfamiliar with the people and having no feelings for the people. Intellectuals have never been down-to-earth; they are a class suspended in mid-air.
    You can see an elephant through the eye of a needle. From these small thoughts about the soil, you can also figure out some great truths: how much intellectuals need to go to the countryside and to the masses to share the same hardships and feelings; and how wise and decisive the great revolutionary measures of cadres being sent to lower levels and intellectuals going up to the mountains and down to the countryside are.
    Go up to the mountains and down to the countryside! The hard soil will grind iron-like calluses on your palms. On the land, you will grow the hands of the working people who create the world and are indestructible; on the land, you will grow the minds of the working people who are devoted to defending and building socialism.

### 对于泥土的感情

    对于泥土的感情
    天津东闸乡农业社　蒋先凡
    下乡参加农业劳动虽然才一个多月，对于泥土的认识和感情前后却是判若两人。
    以前，作为一个“三门”干部（出家门，进校门，再进机关大门），对泥土是陌生的，一年见不到几回土。走的是柏油路、洋灰道，住的是水泥砖木混合结构的楼房，虽然底下基础都是土，但究竟隔着一层，跟土照不了面。白米、白面、韭菜、葱花摆在桌上吃进口里香喷喷，分得出来；五谷蔬菜长在土上又各是什么样，很不清楚。要说跟泥土发生什么直接关系，实在难找。仔细想想呢，还是有的。譬如说有人突然叫起来了：“嗳嗳，你的脸上一块泥巴。”“什么，什么！那里，那里？”一面急急地问，一面顺手去摸，掏手帕去擦。还譬如说卧室里备着两把刷子，一把柄上装镜子的，专刷床上的土，一面带小绳可以挂墙上的，专刷衣上的土，于是一早一晚只听见“刷刷刷”“刷刷刷”刷土的声音。
    总之，在城市知识分子的实际生活中，泥土就是这样一种陌生甚至可厌的东西。它似乎一无用处，对它有什么感情是谈不上的。
    下乡以后，情况完全变了。只有到这时候似乎才真正成了生长在土地上的人了。你每一步都走在实实在在的土地上。住的房子是泥盖的，还跟着老大爷亲手和泥盘炕，拌土砌灶。至于劳动，无论翻土担泥、挑河填沟，一抬腿一?胳膊全都是征服泥土的伟大斗争中的一部分。
    在劳动中，自然而然地逐渐关心起土来了。半夜睡醒听见风声呼呼，你在被窝里就琢磨开土会不会冻上，还下得了铣吗。看到从河里挑上来和田头积起来的黑油油的淤泥，你会用老乡的口吻问：“老大爷，这土‘有劲’吗？”“瑞雪兆丰年”本是幼年就熟读的成语，但以往每逢瑞雪，并没有那种应有的喜悦。只有现在，刚下了头两场雪，老乡说好雪，自己打心田深处也喜吱吱的，望着农业社白茫茫的庄稼地，像每个农民那样以眼前长起一片丰收的金黄世界：随风摇曳的沉甸甸的稻子，小麦，拳头大的棉花苞和马尾巴粗的高粱穗子。
    本来，在土地上进行的劳动是我国六亿人中五亿人的劳动，它养活着所有人。在劳动人民的心眼里泥土是可贵而又可亲的。可是知识分子就不与群众同感情。记得电影和小说里常有这样的镜头和场面：农民和土地亲吻，远征的士兵贴身珍藏着一把故乡的泥土。以往看到这种地方就有点想不通，干吗对黑黑的泥块一定要那样做。近来才略略领会其中情深意厚。真是，可怜的知识分子啊！如果不上山下乡，他连体会文人笔下的工农感情都有困难哪！
    事实上，远离土地也就是远离劳动人民。和泥土陌生、对泥土无情也就是和人民陌生、对人民无情。知识分子历来就没脚踏实地，是悬在半空的阶层。
    透过针眼瞧得见大象。从以上这些对于泥土的小感想里也能琢磨出点大道理来：知识分子何等需要到农村去、到群众中去共甘苦同感情；干部下放、知识分子上山下乡这个伟大的革命措施又是何等英明果断。
    上山下乡去！硬帮帮的泥土要在你的掌上磨起铁般的老茧。在土地上，你要长起劳动人民创造世界和无坚不摧的双手；在土地上，你要长起劳动人民奋身捍卫和建设社会主义的头脑。
