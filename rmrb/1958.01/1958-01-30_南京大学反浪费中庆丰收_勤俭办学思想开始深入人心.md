    (Reported by this newspaper) Nanjing University launched a special "Speak Out Freely" campaign centering on diligence and thrift in running the university on January 3rd, setting off a high tide of anti-waste. According to preliminary statistics, the amount of waste throughout the university is close to one million yuan, with the Physics and Chemistry departments alone wasting more than four hundred thousand yuan. Currently, the university has taken concrete measures to eliminate waste. President Guo Yingqiu has proposed four competition conditions for diligence and thrift in running universities to the Jiangsu Provincial Higher Education Bureau.

    According to exposures, the accumulation and waste of instruments and equipment are significant. In the procurement of instruments and medicines, there was a mentality of being greedy for new things, greedy for good things, and blindly ordering, resulting in serious waste. The Physics Department did not carefully study specifications and varieties when purchasing instruments, rendering them unusable after purchase and causing waste. For example, a precision heating furnace and three metal creep testing machines, worth 114,000 yuan, were accumulated for two years before being transferred to factories and other schools. The Chemistry Department blindly ordered 800 grams of D-arabitol (500 grams of which have been transferred to other units), wasting more than 150,000 yuan. Due to the influence of departmentalism, departments and research groups within departments could not borrow instruments from each other. For example, the entire university has 63 cameras, reel-to-reel recorders, and nine steel wire recorders, which are not used efficiently. However, because they are not borrowed from each other, there is still a feeling that they are not enough. The Biology Department has 243 microscopes and dissecting microscopes. Because many teachers occupy one each, or even two or three each, the utilization rate is not high, resulting in waste. The damage to instruments is also very serious. Fourteen reflecting polarizing microscopes in the Geology Department, with a total value of 28,000 yuan, were placed in a dark room and have become delaminated because the quality was not suitable. The Physics Department has currently exposed and verified by the leadership 21 major instrument damages, accumulations, and wastes, amounting to 333,300 yuan.

    In addition, there is also waste in books and magazines. Thousands of books in the library have been lost or damaged. The Biology Department library subscribes to more than 130 kinds of foreign language magazines and more than 60 kinds of Chinese magazines. Some magazines are never read at all. The Biology Department ordered 297 kinds of periodicals (140 kinds of periodicals from capitalist countries), two-thirds of which were unnecessary to order.

    The exposed waste has prompted people to wake up, and the ideology of diligence and thrift in running the university has begun to take root. Currently, all personnel are both exposing waste and improving their work. Departments with more instruments and equipment (such as the Chemistry Department and Physics Department) are mobilizing the masses to focus on inspecting and counting materials to better understand the situation. As for departments with fewer instruments and equipment, they have also made achievements in the utilization of books and houses. Among students, there is a heated discussion about the People's Scholarship program, and many students have voluntarily requested to reduce or abandon parts that do not need to be subsidized. Currently, a large-scale debate on diligence and thrift in running the university is underway, and a style of hard work and simplicity is taking shape.

    南京大学反浪费中庆丰收
    勤俭办学思想开始深入人心
    本报讯　南京大学从1月3日起，开始了以勤俭办学为中心的专题鸣放，掀起了反浪费的高潮。据初步统计，全校浪费数字将近百万元，仅物理、化学两系就浪费了四十余万元。目前，该校已采取具体措施杜绝浪费现象，校长郭影秋向江苏省高等学校提出四项勤俭办学的竞赛条件。
    根据揭发，仪器设备方面的积压浪费很大。在采购仪器、药品时，存在着贪新、贪好、盲目订购的思想，造成严重浪费。物理系在购买仪器时，不仔细研究规格品种，买来后就不能用，造成浪费，如精细化加热炉、金属蠕变试验机三架，价值十一万四千元，积压了两年才转给工厂与其他学校。化学系盲目订购了D阿拉伯糖醇八百克（内五百克已转交其他单位），浪费了十五万余元。由于本位主义思想作祟，系与系之间，系内教研组之间都不能互借仪器。如全校有照像机六十三架，胶架、钢丝录音机九架，利用率不高，但因互不借用，还嫌不够。生物系有显微镜、解剖镜二百四十三架，由于许多教师一人占一架，甚至一人占二、三架，因而利用率不高，造成浪费。仪器损坏情况，也非常严重。地质系十四架反光偏光显微镜，总价值二万八千元，因质量不合用，放在暗室里已脱胶了。物理系目前揭发出来并经领导上查明的二十一项重要仪器损坏、积压、浪费已达三十三万三千元。
    此外，图书杂志也有浪费现象，图书馆的上千册书被遗失和损坏。生物系图书室订有外文杂志一百三十多种，中文杂志六十多种，有的杂志根本没有人看。生物系订了期刊二百九十七种（资本主义国家期刊一百四十种），这些期刊有三分之二是没有必要订购的。
    通过揭发出来的浪费现象，促使人们猛醒，勤俭办学的思想开始深入人心。目前，全校人员正在一面揭发浪费，一面改进工作。在仪器设备较多的系（如化学系、物理系）正在发动群众重点检查和清点物质，更好地摸清底细。至于仪器设备较少的系，也在图书及房屋利用上做出了成绩。在学生中正在热烈地讨论人民助学金问题，并有不少学生自动要求减少与放弃不必补助的部分。目前，勤俭办学的大辩论正在开展，艰苦朴素的风气正在形成。
