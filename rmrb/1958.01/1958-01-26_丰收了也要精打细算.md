    Even in Times of Plenty, Careful Calculation is Essential

    After the year-end distribution in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province in 1957, some agricultural cooperatives lavishly spent money and resources under the guise of celebrating the victory of increased income for their members, slaughtering pigs and sheep. In Panzhong Township, all sixteen agricultural cooperatives in the township deducted over 100 yuan each as funds for purchasing pigs during the distribution. On the day of the victory celebration, the Xinju Cooperative in the township slaughtered two pigs weighing over 100 jin each, consumed over sixty tables of food and wine, wasting over 90 yuan, and delaying the labor of over two hundred people for a day. The Jiandu Cooperative planned to use the cooperative's public accumulation and welfare funds for feasting. Some agricultural cooperatives in Yueguang Township also slaughtered two fat pigs and five fat cattle, wasting over 300 yuan. In particular, the Seventh Cooperative slaughtered an ox, which was eaten by cadres above the group leader level, excluding the members. The members reflected: the cadres lead well, leading to slaughtering draught cattle for eating. This kind of wasteful phenomenon is serious and incompatible with the Party Central Committee's policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily." It is suggested that relevant departments immediately stop it.

    丰收了也要精打细算
    江西永新县1957年年终分配以后，有部分农业社用庆祝社员增加收入的胜利大会的名义大肆铺张浪费，杀猪宰羊。泮中乡全乡十六个农业社，在分配时，各社都扣出一百多元，作为买猪资金。该乡新居社在开胜利大会这一天，杀了二头百多斤重的肥猪，吃了六十多桌酒饭，共浪费掉九十多元，并耽误了二百多个劳力一天的时间。枧度社准备将社里的公积、公益金拿来吃掉。月光乡的部分农业社也杀了二头肥猪、五头肥牛，共浪费三百多元。特别是第七社宰了一头牛，由小组长以上干部来吃，社员没有吃。社员反映说：干部领导好，领导宰耕牛吃。这种浪费现象是严重的，是与党中央提出的“勤俭办社，勤俭持家”的方针不相容的，建议有关部门立即制止。
