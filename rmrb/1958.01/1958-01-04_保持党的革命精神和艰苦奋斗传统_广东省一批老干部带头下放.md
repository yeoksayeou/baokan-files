To Maintain the Party's Revolutionary Spirit and the Tradition of Hard Struggle
A Group of Veteran Cadres in Guangdong Province Take the Lead in Going Down to Lower Levels

(Our newspaper's special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou) Eighty-eight leading cadres at the level of deputy director and director of departments and bureaus in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have requested to go down to lower levels, including ten members of the Provincial Party Committee. Lin Liming, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, has already gone to work on Hainan Island and set off on December 23 last year.

These eighty-eight department and bureau directors registered at the provincial and municipal cadres' mobilization meeting held on December 23 last year. On the spot, 3,047 cadres above the section level, most of whom were Communist Party members, also applied to go to the mountains and countryside, participate in agricultural production on Hainan Island, and go down to the grassroots.

Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, made a mobilization report at the meeting. He called on veteran revolutionary cadres to maintain the Party's revolutionary spirit and the tradition of hard struggle and take the lead in going down to lower levels. He said that whether veteran cadres can go to the most difficult places is a test of our revolutionary qualities. He also called on new cadres to go down to lower levels and temper themselves in the storm.

Many veteran Communist Party members who had been tested in struggle during the war years took the lead in signing up at the meeting, requesting to go down to lower levels. Rao Zhangfeng, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, was the first to run to the podium to express his determination to the Party. He said that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he relied on the protection of the peasants to escape the pursuit of the enemy and had a deep affection for the peasant brothers. However, after the Japanese surrender, his job was transferred to the city. For twelve years, his life and work have been separated from the countryside and detached from the basic masses, resulting in his thinking lagging behind the rapid changes in the situation. Therefore, he needs to be tempered and transformed. Luo Keming, Acting Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department, although he had been working in the countryside five years ago, also signed up this time and resolutely demanded to return to the rural work post. Luo Keming said excitedly: "I will take up the sickle and axe on the Party flag, march towards production, and march towards labor!" He has prepared to move his family to the countryside.

Comrade Tao Zhu, on behalf of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, approved the requests of Rao Zhangfeng, Luo Keming and other thirteen people on the spot. Among these thirteen people are Wei Nanjin, Deputy Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department, Li Wenhua, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Zhang Jie, Deputy Director of the Provincial Public Security Department, and Huang Dafang, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    保持党的革命精神和艰苦奋斗传统
    广东省一批老干部带头下放
    本报特约新华社广州电　广东省和广州市有八十八位正副厅长、局长级领导干部要求下放，其中有十名省委委员。省委书记林李明同志已下放到海南岛工作，并于去年12月23日启程。
    这八十八位厅、局长是在去年12月23日召开的省、市干部下放动员大会上报名的。当场申请上山下乡、到海南岛去参加农业生产和下放基层的还有科级以上干部三千零四十七人，他们大部都是共产党员。
    中共广东省委第一书记陶铸在大会上作了动员报告。他号召革命老干部要保持党的革命精神和艰苦奋斗的传统，带头下放。他说，老干部能不能到最艰苦的地方去，是对我们革命品质的一个考验。他也号召新干部下放，到风雨里去锻炼。
    许多在过去战争年代里经受过斗争考验的老共产党员，都在这个大会上争先报名，要求下放。中共广东省委统战部部长饶彰风同志，第一个跑上讲台向党表示了他的决心。他说，在抗日战争时期，他依靠了农民的掩护才逃避了敌人的追捕，和农民兄弟有着深厚的感情。但是，日本投降以后，他的工作岗位转移到了城市。十二年来，他的生活与工作都离开了农村，脱离了基本群众，致使自己的思想落后于形势的迅速变化，因此，需要锻炼，需要改造。省委财贸部代部长罗克明，虽然五年前还一直在农村工作，但这次也报了名，坚决要求再回到农村工作岗位去。罗克明激动地说：“我要拿起党旗上的镰刀斧头，向生产进军，向劳动进军！”他已准备把家庭搬到农村去。
    陶铸同志代表中共广东省委当场批准了饶彰风、罗克明等十三人的请求。这十三人中还有省委财贸部副部长魏南金、省农业
  厅厅长李文华、省公安厅副厅长张杰、省团委副书记黄大仿等人。
