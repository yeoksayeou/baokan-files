    Militia Capture "Bandits" on a Rainy Night
    Liu Chenyu
    On the evening of November 5, 1957, at a little past eight o'clock, members of the Pengdong Agricultural Cooperative in Pengjie Township, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, were performing entertainment programs after finishing their "blooming and contending" meeting. Communist Party member Huang Jinkui quietly left the venue, thinking he should check on the cooperative's warehouse. He was a demobilized soldier and a member of the militia, and during times of general merriment, he habitually felt he should be more vigilant than others. As soon as he stepped out of the venue's gate, he suddenly heard the roar of airplane engines and the sound of anti-aircraft shells exploding in the night sky. Then he saw a ball of fire suddenly appear in the sky, growing from small to large, falling like a meteor, and dropping on the northeast side of the village.
    "The enemy's plane has been shot down! Let's go capture the prisoners!" Huang Jinkui shouted, rushing home to grab his gun and leading several militiamen toward the direction of the fire. When they reached the vicinity of the wreckage of the Chiang Kai-shek plane, Chen Tiantang, a cadre from the Jinqing Farm, ran over and told them that he had seen several dark figures running towards the eastern coast from the fire. He fired a few shots, and these figures turned northwest. Huang Jinkui immediately led the militia to a bridge at the northwest intersection to intercept them.
    At this time, the sky was pitch black, and the rain was pouring down. Militiamen from Shizhu, Sanjia, Pengxi, and Pudong braved the rain to search every ditch and furrow around the wreckage of the Chiang Kai-shek plane for hidden Chiang Kai-shek military flight personnel.
    There were originally five people on the downed Chiang Kai-shek plane. Two had died in the crash. The remaining three were dreaming of finding a chance to escape by sea. With the militia shouting to fight them everywhere, they couldn't go east or escape west, and they confusedly ran towards the edge of the village, where they were spotted by agricultural cooperative members Ruan Menggen, Ying Youman, and others, who immediately shouted, "They're here, come and capture the prisoners!" Militiamen Zheng Shiyun and Wang Liqing, who were searching nearby, rushed over and fired two shots at the enemy. The frightened enemy immediately rolled down the embankment into the sorghum field, crouching and daring not to move. At this moment, Huang Jinkui and Cao Fubing arrived after hearing the shouts. They dashed to the embankment and lay down next to a small tree. With the unique keen eye of a soldier, Huang Jinkui spotted the enemy lying in the sorghum field. He aimed his gun at the enemy and shouted sternly, "Hands up! Surrender your weapons and you will not be killed. The People's Government treats prisoners leniently!"
    The three Chiang Kai-shek Air Force officers, their faces blackened by burns, obediently raised their hands, trembling as they walked out of the sorghum field, becoming prisoners of the militia. These three prisoners were: Wang Weiduo, Major and primary pilot of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force B-26 type No. 482 bomber; Kong Xiangzhang, Major and co-pilot; and Li Fuquan, Captain and navigator.

    民兵雨夜捉“飞贼”
    刘臣玉
    1957年11月5日晚上八点多钟，浙江省黄岩县蓬街乡蓬东农业社的社员们开完了鸣放大会，正在表演文娱节目。共产党员黄金魁轻轻迈出会场，心想去查看一下合作社的仓库。他是复员军人，又是民兵，在大家欢乐的时刻，他照例要比别人更加警惕些。他刚一走出会场的大门，突然听到一阵阵飞机马达的轰鸣声和高射炮弹在夜空中的爆炸声，接着又看见空中突然出现了一团火球，从小到大，像流星一样坠下，掉在村子的东北边。
    “敌人的飞机被咱们打下来啦！快去捉俘虏啊！”黄金魁一边大喊着，一边急忙回家拿了枪，带领几个民兵朝着火光的方向奔去。他们赶到蒋机残骸附近的时候，金清农场干部陈天堂跑来告诉他们说，他从火光中看见几条黑影向东海岸跑去，他打了几枪，这几条黑影就拐向西北去了。黄金魁立即带领民兵奔向西北路口的一座桥上去堵击。
    这时，天色漆黑，大雨如注。石柱、三甲、蓬西和浦东等地的民兵都冒雨在蒋机残骸周围逐沟逐畦地搜索隐藏起来的蒋军飞行人员。
    被击落的蒋机上原有五个人，除两名已摔死外，剩下三个家伙正在梦想寻机下海逃跑。他们在民兵到处喊打的情况下，东走不成，西逃不脱，竟昏头昏脑地向村边跑来，恰好被农业社员阮孟根、应有满等撞见，当即大喊起来：“在这里呀，快来捉俘虏！”正在附近搜索的民兵郑士云、王立庆奔过来就朝敌人打了两枪。吓的敌人立刻滚下海塘边的高粱地里，蜷伏着不敢动弹。这时，黄金魁和曹傅炳两人闻声赶到了，他们一个箭步冲到堤上，在一棵小树边卧倒。黄金魁以军人独有的敏锐的眼光，发现了趴在高粱地里的敌人。他把枪口对准了敌人，厉声喝道：“举起手来！缴枪不杀，人民政府宽待俘虏！”
    三个被烧得焦头烂额的蒋军空军军官都乘乘地举起手来，颤抖着走出高粱地，做了民兵的俘虏。这三个俘虏就是：蒋军空军B——二六型第四八二号轰炸机少校正驾驶员王为铎，少校副驾驶员孔祥璋，上尉领航官李复权。
