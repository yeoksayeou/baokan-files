(Our newspaper, Hefei, January 22nd) Anhui Province's rural rectification work has been fully underway since December of last year. Currently, over half of the province's cooperatives, a total of 8,841, are undergoing rectification, with 855 cooperatives already rectified. During the rectification, the focus is first on rectifying the third-category cooperatives and teams. All 1,701 third-category cooperatives and 15,000 third-category teams in the province have entered a high tide of rectification. Among them, one-third of the third-category cooperatives have been upgraded to first or second-category cooperatives after rectification.

During the rectification, leaders at all levels have paid attention to using the rectification to promote all rural work, enabling the simultaneous advancement of various winter and spring agricultural production tasks. Farmers throughout the province have achieved significant results in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, elimination of the four pests, and afforestation.

Through the rectification of cooperatives, a new atmosphere has emerged in the countryside, cadres have changed their work style, agricultural cooperatives have improved their management, the class line in the countryside has been implemented, and agricultural cooperatives have been consolidated. According to statistics from 339 agricultural cooperatives in ten counties of the Bengbu and Fuyang districts, before the rectification, there were 5,043 brigade leaders and team leaders who did not participate in production. After the rectification, 96% of them have participated in production. Li Bingjun, director of the Lieshan Cooperative in Suixi County, now carries a manure basket to collect manure when he goes to work in the team. Cadres of the Beiyu Cooperative in Lujiang County not only lead production by participating in production, but each person also cultivates high-yield experimental plots to gain experience and better lead agricultural production. In terms of business management, agricultural cooperatives in various places have implemented a system of contracting production quotas once a year based on the opinions of the masses, with tasks submitted in the summer and autumn seasons, and advance payments and bonuses (overproduction is proportionally returned to the team) and advance compensation (compensation for reduced production) are implemented when summer grain is harvested, with settlement at the end of the year. All cooperatives have cleared their finances.

In terms of implementing the class line, judging from the election of cooperative cadres after the rectification of twenty-two cooperatives in four counties, including Chuxian, Dangtu, Wuwei, and Jixi, among the 290 directors and members of the management committees and supervisory committees before the rectification, 75 were upper-middle peasants, accounting for 26%. After the rectification, among the 280 directors and members of the management committees and supervisory committees, poor peasants accounted for 64.3%, and upper-middle peasants accounted for 20%, accounting for 11%. The chairmen of the management committees and supervisory committees are all held by party members of poor peasant origin.

During the rectification of cooperatives, farmers have received a profound education and have more confidence in building a socialist countryside. They said: "Propose three things and change three things, the Communist Party's leadership is really good, as long as you work hard, socialism will be done well!" Those who originally wavered and asked to withdraw from the cooperative no longer withdraw, and individual farmers are also applying to join the cooperative. Individual villages that did not originally organize agricultural cooperatives have also established advanced cooperatives. According to a survey of thirty cooperatives in ten counties, including Fuyang, Linquan, Jiashan, and Shexian, 859 cooperative members who originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative no longer withdrew, and 167 individual farmers requested to join the cooperative. Daduanjiacun in Fengtai County is a well-known backward village in the county with individual farming. Most of the village is composed of wealthy middle peasants. The surrounding villages have been cooperating for two years, and they still say: "No mutual assistance, no cooperation, freedom to farm individually to the end." After being greatly influenced by the rectification of the third-category cooperatives and receiving socialist education, the entire village has established an advanced cooperative.

At present, Anhui Province plans to complete the rectification of 40% of the cooperatives (including all third-category cooperatives) before the Spring Festival, and it is expected to complete the rectification of another 40% of the cooperatives before the spring plowing. At the same time, it will solve the problems related to production, such as contracting work and production, and financial clearing, in the remaining 20% of agricultural cooperatives in order to prepare for spring plowing in a timely manner.

    安徽农村全面开展整风
    整顿了农业社推动了农业生产
    本报合肥22日电　安徽省的农村整风工作，从去年12月起全面展开。目前占全省一半以上的社共八千八百四十一个社都进行了整社，有八百五十五个社已整顿完毕。在整社中首先着重整顿三类社、队。全省一千七百零一个三类社和一万五千个三类队都进入整改高潮。其中有三分之一的三类社经过整顿后已跃升为一、二类社。
    在整社中各级领导都注意以整风推动农村中一切工作，使冬春季各项农业生产齐头并进。全省农民在兴修水利、积肥、除四害、绿化等方面都获得显著成绩。
    经过整社，农村中已出现了新的气象，干部转变了作风，农业社改进了经营管理，农村中的阶级路线得到贯彻，农业社巩固了。据蚌埠、阜阳两专区十个县三百三十九个农业社的统计，在整社前，不参加生产的社干部大队长有五千零四十三名，整社后已有96％的人参加生产。濉溪县烈山社主任李秉钧现在下队工作都背着粪筐拾粪。庐江县北圩社的干部，不仅通过参加生产来领导生产，每个人还种了丰产试验田，以便取得经验，更好地领导农业生产。在经营管理方面，各地农业社都根据群众意见实行了全年一次包产，分夏秋两季交任务，收夏粮时就实行预支预奖（超产按比例归队），预赔（减产赔偿），年终结算的办法。各个社都清理了财务。
    在贯彻阶级路线方面，从滁县、当涂、无为、绩溪等四个县二十二个社整顿结束后选举社干部的情况来看，整社前管委、监委的主任和委员二百九十人中，上中农有七十五人，占26％；整顿后管委监委主任和委员二百八十人中贫农占64.3％，上中农有二十人占11％，管委会主任和监委会主任都由贫农成份的党员担任。
    在整社中农民们都受到了一次深刻的教育，对建设社会主义的农村更有了信心，他们说：“提三条改三条，共产党领导实在好，只要下劲干，社会主义办得好！”那些原来动摇要求退社的不退了，单干农民也纷纷申请入社，个别原来没有组织农业社的村也办起了高级社。据阜阳、临泉、嘉山、歙县等十个县三十个社的调查，原来要求退社的八百五十九户社员不退社了，一百六十七户单干农民要求入社。凤台县大段家庄是全县出名的单干落后庄，全庄大多数是富裕中农，周围村庄实现合作化已两年，他们还说：“一不互助，二不合作，自由自在单干到底。”在受到大力整顿三类社的影响和对他们进行了社会主义教育后，全庄已办起了高级社。
    目前安徽全省计划在春节前将40％的社整顿结束（包括全部三类社），春耕前预计再整顿完40％的社，同时解决其余20％农业社中的有关生产如包工包产、财务清理等的问题，以便及时做好春耕生产。
