    Our newspaper reports that at the model representative conference of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers in Hubei Province, Fang Heming, who once served as a regiment commander in the Red Army, returned home and worked as a farmer for eight years, diligently and thriftily building his hometown. His exemplary deeds greatly educated and encouraged the more than 500 representatives attending and present at the conference.
    Fang Heming is now the political director and Party branch secretary of the Liulin Township Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Hong'an County, Hubei Province. This man, hailed as "the model of models," was originally from a peasant background. He joined the revolution in 1929 and the Chinese Communist Party in 1930. During the Red Army and the Eighth Route Army periods, he served as a soldier, squad leader, platoon leader, company commander, battalion commander, regiment commander, and other positions. He went through the Long March, climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands, enduring many hardships. He fought bravely and resolutely, was wounded seven times, and received thirteen awards. After the national liberation in 1949, the superiors decided to let Fang Heming rest due to his weakened body from too many injuries, but he disagreed. He said, "I don't want the Party and the country to support me for nothing. I am from a peasant background, and although my body is weak now, I can still work. Please allow me to go home and work as much as I can." Thus, Fang Heming, who had participated in the revolution for twenty years, only took 500 jin of millet as resettlement allowance, carried a small roll of luggage, and returned to his hometown in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, located in the Dabie Mountains. At that time, although the country was liberated, the land reform had not yet been carried out. Fang Heming's family, like twenty years ago, was still a tenant farmer renting land, but the population had increased, his father was old, and his younger brother and sister-in-law were in poor health. His two young nieces, who were only a few years old, had also been given away as child brides due to difficult living conditions. As soon as Fang Heming returned home, he immediately took these two young nieces back. This matter was quickly known to the neighbors, who praised him, saying, "The old Red Army soldier! He has excellent virtues!" Later, in order to make a living, he temporarily rented nine mu of land from a rich peasant to cultivate. From then on, Fang Heming worked like ordinary farmers all day long, but because he had been injured many times and his physical strength was weak, he felt particularly tired. Unfortunately, not long after he returned home, his younger brother died of illness, and the burden of supporting a family of seven fell on his shoulders. Many villagers advised him, "Old Fang! You have been in the revolution for twenty years, suffered so much, and shed a lot of blood. Even if you don't have merit, you have worked hard. You should ask the government for relief!" Fang Heming always replied with a smile, "No! If one person asks the government, two people ask the government, and everyone asks the government, where will the government get the money for relief?"
    "He is really a good person!" those who advised him always said, nodding their heads and walking away.
    In 1950, when the state issued economic construction bonds for the first time, this old Communist Party member, who had participated in the revolution for twenty years, was extremely excited. However, he did not have the money to buy the bonds, but he felt uneasy if he didn't buy them. So, he worked odd jobs for a few days and earned more than 10,000 old currency, which he used to buy the bonds. The masses advised him, "Old Fang! You have so many difficulties! Don't buy them." He said, "The country's affairs are like my own affairs. The country's difficulties must be resolved first, and personal difficulties are secondary."
    Later, the land reform was realized, and his family was allocated land. He had only worked as a hired laborer since he was a child, and only knew how to herd cattle and sheep, and didn't know how to cultivate fields or transplant rice seedlings. His elderly father was already blind and could not go to the fields. In order to learn how to cultivate fields and transplant rice seedlings, he studied diligently. In less than a year, he became an expert in farming. Just as life was beginning to improve, his father and sister-in-law unfortunately passed away one after another. From then on, he had to shoulder all the work inside and outside the house alone. In addition to farming, he also had to take care of the children's food, clothing, and shelter. However, such difficulties did not overwhelm him. In terms of clothing and use, he was extremely frugal. He rarely wore shoes from March to November every year. He turned his father's and brother's large gown, which they had worn for eight years, into a short jacket and wore it for another two years. He still often wears a cotton-padded jacket he brought back from Yan'an. A gray cotton quilt that the army issued to him during the Anti-Japanese War, with many patches, is still used as a cover. He was also very frugal in terms of food. During the winter slack season, he would pick water chestnuts and wild vegetables as the family's staple food, so as to save the grain for eating during the busy farming season. When he saw that the children were reluctant to eat water chestnuts and wild vegetables, he would tell them stories of the Red Army's hard life, comforting them by saying, "Eat it! Children, the Red Army sometimes couldn't even eat grass roots!" The children listened and ate mouthfuls. He often said, "When suffering, look forward and see the big picture; when enjoying happiness, look back and don't forget your roots." He said that this was the experience he had gained from participating in the revolution for more than twenty years.
    Since returning to his hometown, Fang Heming has been enthusiastic and sincere towards the villagers, willing to help people, and has a good relationship with the masses. Farmers are willing to talk to him and consult him when they have something to do. Although he is never proud, never boasts, and never mentions to others what positions he held after participating in the revolution; however, over time, the masses slowly learned that he had already been a regiment commander during the Red Army period. Therefore, some well-meaning farmers and villagers often advised him when talking to him, "You are a person who has worked hard even if you have no merit. If you hadn't returned, you would have become a high-ranking cadre and enjoyed happiness. You have also been injured many times and your body is not good. You should go to the government more often and ask for some relief. It's better than suffering and living in difficult conditions every day. Or find a job, it's better than farming." Fang Heming replied, "No, I can't do that. Being a cadre is not for enjoying happiness, but for socialism. We Communist Party members must especially obey the interests of the Party. In the past, when there was a need to fight, I went to fight. Now that there is a need for labor and production, I will come back to farm. Both the past and the present are glorious, and both are for socialism." Those who advised him had no choice but to nod and walk away. When resting from working in the fields, some people often said to him half-jokingly, "Old Fang! I see it's a bit uneconomical for you to work so hard! You don't want to be a regiment commander and come back to do this. It was hard to suffer in the army in the past because there was war. Now it's peaceful, but you come back to suffer. You just don't know how to enjoy happiness!" Fang Heming replied, "Who said it's uneconomical? I used to be a hired laborer for others, and I was oppressed and impoverished for generations. I joined the revolution, defeated the enemy, and now I'm back to work and produce on my own land. That's what's economical! If you say that's uneconomical, then the comrades who sacrificed themselves are even more uneconomical. If everyone planned like you, where would today's revolutionary victory come from?" Finally, the person asking the question was speechless and had to nod and walk away.
    After the land reform in his hometown, life was still very difficult due to the mountainous area, and his villagers were no better off than him. Therefore, he thought of Chairman Mao's instructions: organize and develop production, only in this way can we live a prosperous life. Therefore, he organized mutual aid and cooperation, but at that time many farmers were not used to mutual aid. He carried out patient persuasion work. Some farmers had weak labor force, so he put down his own work and took the initiative to help. Some lacked food, and he also took the initiative to lend it out, willing to overcome some difficulties himself to help solve the difficulties of others. In this way, they first organized a mutual aid group, with him as the leader. After a year, practice proved that the mutual aid group produced more than 20 jin of grain per mu than individual households. Therefore, mutual aid groups were generally established throughout the township. Later, when the mutual aid group was transferred to a lower-level cooperative, Fang Heming again patiently explained the various specific ideological concerns of the farmers. The lower-level cooperative was finally formed, and the masses elected Fang Heming as the chairman of the cooperative. At that time, he felt that he was too old and his production technology was not strong, so he recommended others to be the chairman of the cooperative. But the masses did not agree, saying, "If you don't be the chairman of the cooperative, we won't cooperate." So, he became the chairman of the cooperative. Their cooperative was one of the first to be established in the county. In order to consolidate the cooperative and set an example among the masses, Fang Heming always took the lead in labor, regardless of whether it was cold or hot. During the autumn harvest that year, each mu produced more than 120 jin. In the spring of 1955, under the call of the Party, three cooperatives in the township were merged into one advanced cooperative. Fang Heming served as the Party branch secretary and political director of the cooperative. Although Fang Heming was in charge of the Party work and administrative management work of the cooperative, he also actively participated in labor. In the summer, he worked barefoot in the fields; in the winter, he went up the mountain to chop firewood and picked pond mud. Sometimes, due to overwork, the wound on his chest would flare up and hurt badly. The cooperative members advised him to rest, and he said, "I didn't leave the front line when I was injured in the past. Now that the scar hurts a little, I can still participate in production." He always endured the pain of the wound and worked tirelessly from morning to night. Last year alone, he did more than 2,000 work points. Adding up the work points of his children, there were a total of more than 3,000, equivalent to more than 210 yuan in cash. He immediately took out 110 yuan to repay the government loan. He said to the children, "The country needs money for construction now. It doesn't matter if our life is a little tight, it's still important to repay the loan. Even if we suffer a little, it's much better than a few years ago." Now the yield per mu of his cooperative has increased to 700 jin, an increase of more than 300 jin compared to the yield per mu during the period of individual households.
    Fang Heming is so hardworking and simple. Is it that he really doesn't want to eat well, dress well, and live well? No. He often said to those who asked him, "Making everyone dress well, eat well, and live well is the goal of the revolution. From the first day I joined the Red Army, I fought and shed blood for this; now I am also actively engaged in production and labor for this. The reason why I don't ask to eat well, dress well, and live well now is because now is not the time to enjoy, our country and people are not yet very rich."
    Under his influence, sixteen demobilized soldiers in Liulin Township are all at ease with agricultural production. They said:
    "Regiment Commander Fang has been in the revolution for twenty years and still works and produces the same way. What reason do we have not to work hard?"
    Disabled soldier Xu Shiqing used to have a proud attitude towards the government. Since hearing about Fang Heming's deeds, he said to others: "I have no merit. Compared with Regiment Commander Fang, he has crossed more bridges than we have walked roads."
    Cooperative member Yu Qingshan thought all day about going outside to find a job and did not work hard. Fang Heming's drive deeply educated him. He said:
    "...Regiment Commander Fang does not rely on the state to support him, and he strives to work with us young people. If I don't settle down to production again, who can I be worthy of!"
    Sometimes when something happens to the young people in the cooperative, Fang Heming patiently educates them like his own nephews and nieces, telling them stories of the Long March and making them understand the difficulty of starting a business. If some cooperative cadres show signs of being out of touch with the masses, Fang Heming will persuade them individually, telling them to be vigilant and to maintain good contact with the masses. It is still Chairman Wang Degeng who said it well, he said:
    "With Fang Heming, our cooperative will always be consolidated and will not collapse..."
    Fang Heming's exemplary deeds caused a great shock among the model representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers in Hubei Province. After listening to his moving report, some people said that they had received a most vivid and specific communist ideological education, and many people praised him as "the model of models." During the meeting, General Chen Zaidao, the leader of the Wuhan garrison of the People's Liberation Army, met with him. They were old comrades-in-arms from the Red Army era. When General Chen Zaidao was still a battalion commander, Fang Heming was the communications squad leader of his battalion. Later, when General Chen Zaidao became the army commander, Fang Heming was already a capable commander: the regiment commander. These two comrades-in-arms, after a long separation, had a long talk. When Chen Zaidao asked him about his life in recent years, Fang Heming said: Just like the Party's cause in the countryside, mutual aid group - lower-level cooperative - advanced cooperative, it is getting better and better every year, and it will be even better in the future.

    战斗廿载功在国家　劳动八年誉满乡里
    红军老团长解甲当农民
    方和明全心全意为革命的高贵品质值得大家学习
    本报讯　在湖北省烈军属、复员军人模范代表会议上，曾经在红军中担任过团长的方和明回家当了八年农民、克勤克俭地建设家乡的模范事迹，对出席和列席会议的五百多名代表发生了极大的教育和鼓舞作用。
    方和明现在是湖北省红安县柳林乡高级农业社的政治主任兼党分支书记。这位被誉为“模范中的模范”人物，原是农民出身，于1929年参加革命，1930年加入中国共产党。在红军中和八路军时期，他历任战士、班长、排长、连长、营长、团长等职。他经过长征、爬过雪山草地，受过许多艰难困苦。他作战勇敢坚决，曾七次负伤，受过十三次奖功。1949年全国解放后，上级为了照顾方和明负伤过多日见衰弱的身体，决定让他去休养，但他不同意。他说“我不愿意让党和国家白白养活自己。我是农民出身，现在身体虽弱，还能劳动。请允许我回家，能劳动多少算多少。”于是，这位参加革命二十年的方和明，只领了五百斤小米的安家费，背着一小卷行李，回到了位于大别山区的湖北红安县他的家乡了。那时，虽然全国解放了，但还没有进行土地改革，方和明的家里同二十年前一样，仍是租田种的佃农，只是人口多了，父亲老了，弟弟和弟媳的身体也都不好。两个几岁的小侄女，也因生活困难送给人家作童养媳了。方和明一回到家，马上便把这两个小侄女接回来。这事很快被邻居们知道了，都称赞说：“老红军！有极好的德性啊！”以后，为了生活，他便从富农那里暂时租来了九亩田种着。从此，方和明便同一般农民一样整天整天地劳动，只是他因多次负伤体力不强，所以感到格外劳累。不幸的是，他到家不久，弟弟就得病死了，全家七口人的生活重担便落到了他的肩上。不少乡亲劝他说：“老方啊！你革了二十年命，受了多少苦，也流了不少血，没功劳也有苦劳，你找政府救济一下吧！”方和明总是笑着回答说：“不啊！一个找政府，两个找政府，都去找政府，政府那来的钱救济？”
    “真是好人啊！”劝他的人总是这样说着，点着头走开了。
    1950年国家第一次发行经济建设公债时，这位参加革命二十年的老共产党员异常兴奋，但是他没有钱购买，不买公债他又于心不安，于是他给人家打了几天短工，赚了一万多元旧币，买了公债。群众劝他说：“老方啊！你困难极多啊！不要买了。”他说：“国家的事就跟我的事一样，国家的困难首先要解决，个人困难是其次。”
    以后，土地改革实现了，他家里分得了土地。他从小给人家当雇工，只会放牛放羊，不会耕田插秧。年老的父亲已经两眼昏花，不能下田。他为了学会耕田插秧，就刻苦地学习，不到一年，庄稼活他都成了内行了。眼看日子刚有起色，他的父亲和弟媳不幸又先后去世了，从此家里家外的活，都由他一人来承担，除了种田，他还得照顾孩子们的吃喝穿戴。可是，这样的困难并没有压倒他。在穿用方面，他格外俭朴。他每年从3月到11月，很少穿鞋子；父亲和弟弟穿过八年的一件大褂，他改成短褂又穿了两年；他从延安带回来的一件棉袄，现在还常常穿着；抗战时期部队发给他的一条灰棉被，补钉很多了，现在还盖着。在吃的方面一样非常俭朴，当冬闲的时候，他就采菱角采野菜作为一家的主食，以便把粮食节省下来到农忙时再吃，当他看到孩子们不乐意吃菱角和野菜时，他便讲红军艰苦生活的故事，安慰孩子们说：“吃吧！孩子，当年红军有时连草根都吃不上啊！”孩子们听了，都大口大口地吃着。他常说：“吃苦的时候要朝前看，看远景，享福的时候要朝后看，别忘本。”他说这是他参加革命二十几年来得到的经验。
    方和明自回乡以后，对待乡亲们热心诚恳，肯帮助人，同群众的关系很好，农民们有话就愿意同他说，有事也愿意找他商量。虽然他从不骄傲，从不夸功，也从不对人提起他参加革命后担任过什么职务；但是日久天长，群众也慢慢地知道了他在红军时期已经是团长了。于是，有些好心的农民们和乡亲们在同他谈心时，也常劝他说：“你是没功劳也有苦劳的人，要不回来，也当了大干部享福了，你又多次挂彩，身体不好，应该多去政府走动走动，要点救济，总比天天吃苦过困难日子好，要不就找个工作做，也比种田好。”方和明回答说：“不能，我不能那样。当干部也不是为了享福，而是为了社会主义。我们共产党员，特别要服从党的利益。过去需要打仗，我就去打仗。现在需要劳动生产，我就回来种田。过去和现在都光荣，都是为了社会主义。”于是，劝他的人也只好点头走开了。在田里干活休息的时候，也常有一些人半开玩笑地对他说：“老方啊！你这样下力气干活，我看有点划不来嗳！团长不当，回来搞这，从前在部队吃苦那是有战争，现时太平了，你却回来吃苦，你总是不晓得享福啊！”方和明回答说：“谁说划不来呢？我过去给人家当长工，受压迫，几辈子受穷，我参加革命，打垮了敌人，现在回到自己的土地上劳动生产，这才划得来嗳！若说这划不来，牺牲了的同志更划不来。假若都照你那样打算，今天的革命胜利从哪里来？”终于，问话的人无言以对，只好点点头走开了。
    在他的家乡土改以后，由于是山区，所以生活仍然很贫困，他的乡亲们也不比他好，于是，他便想起了毛主席的指示：组织起来，发展生产，只有这样，才能过富裕生活，于是，他便组织互助合作，但是当时很多农民对互助不习惯，他便进行耐心的说服工作，有的农民劳动力不强，他便放下自己的活主动去帮助，有的缺口粮，他也主动出借，宁愿自己克服些困难，也要帮助解决别人的困难。这样，他们便首先组织起一个互助组，由他任组长。过了一年，实践证明了互助组比单干户每亩多产二十多斤粮食，于是，互助组便在全乡普遍成立了。后来，由互助组转低级社时，方和明又针对农民的各种具体思想顾虑作了耐心解释，低级社终于组成了，群众便选方和明为社长。当时，他认为自己年龄太大，生产技术不太强，所以推荐别人当社长。但群众不答应，说：“你不当社长，我们就不合作化。”于是，他便当起社长来了。他们这个社是全县最先成立的一个。为了巩固社，在群众中做个样子，方和明不管天冷天热，总是带头劳动。这年秋收时，每亩多产一百二十斤。1955年春天，在党的号召下，全乡三个社合并为一个高级社，方和明担任了社的党分支书记兼政治主任。方和明虽然担负着社的党的工作和行政管理工作，但也积极劳动，夏天，赤着背在田里做活，冬天，上山打柴，下水挑塘泥，有时劳动过度，他胸前的伤口发作，痛得厉害，社员们劝他休息，他说：“过去负伤都不下火线，现在伤疤痛一点，还能不参加生产。”他总是忍着伤口的疼痛，从早到晚，劳动不息。去年一年他又做了二千多个工分。加上他家孩子们的工分一共有三千多个，合现款二百一十多元。他一下就拿出一百一十元偿还政府的贷款。他对孩子们说：“现在国家建设正需要钱，咱们生活紧一点没关系，还是还贷款要紧。咱们就是苦一点，也比前几年好多了。”现在他这个社的亩产量提高到七百斤，比单干户时期的亩产量增加了三百余斤。
    方和明这样艰苦朴素，是不是他真的不愿吃好、穿好、住好呢？不是的。他常常向询问他的人说：“使人人穿好、吃好、住好，是革命的目的。我从参加红军的第一天起，就是为了这个打仗、流血的；现在也是为了这个在积极地生产劳动。我所以现在不要求吃、穿、住好，是因为现在还不是享受的时候，我们的国家和人民还不很富裕。”
    在他的影响下，柳林乡有十六个复员军人，个个都安心农业生产。他们说：
    “方团长参加革命二十年还一样劳动生产，我们有什么理由不好好劳动。”
    残废军人徐仕清，过去对政府有居功骄傲的表现，自从听到方和明的事迹以后，便向人说：“我没有功，比起方团长来，人家过的桥也比咱走的路多。”
    社员余清山，整天想到外面去找工作，不好好劳动，方和明的那股干劲深深地教育了他。他说：
    “……方团长不依靠国家养活，和我们青年人一起还竭力地干，我要是再不安心生产，能对得起谁！”
    有时候社里的小伙子们发生了什么问题，方和明就像教育自己的侄儿和侄女一样耐心，给他们讲长征故事，叫他们懂得创业的艰难。有的社干部有脱离群众的表现，方和明就个别说服，叫他引起警惕，很好地联系群众。还是王德庚社长说得好，他说：
    “我们有了方和明，我们的社就永远巩固，不会垮台。……”
    方和明的模范事迹，在湖北省烈军属、复员军人模范代表中震动很大。听了他的动人的报告以后，有人说是受了一堂最生动、最具体的共产主义思想教育，不少人赞誉他是“模范中的模范”。会议期间，武汉驻军领导人陈再道上将接见了他。他们是红军时代的老战友，当陈再道将军还是营长的时候，方和明是他营的通讯班长。以后陈再道将军当了军长的时候，方和明已是一位能干的指挥员：团长了。这两位战友久别重逢，作了很长时间的畅谈。当陈再道问起他这些年的生活时，方和明说：就像党在农村的事业一样，互助组——低级社——高级社，一年比一年好，以后还会更好。
