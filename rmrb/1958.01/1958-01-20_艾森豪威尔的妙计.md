Notes

    Eisenhower's Clever Plan
    On January 16th, Eisenhower presented an agricultural policy message to the U.S. Congress. He devised a "clever plan" to "rescue" the increasingly serious agricultural crisis in the United States. He said that an important policy measure of the U.S. government in the future is to strengthen the plan to make small and medium-sized farmers reduce their cultivated land area, so as to prevent the situation of American farmers in "extremely difficult" situations from further deteriorating by means of this mandatory reduction in agricultural production.

    The mystery of this is indeed difficult to comprehend. Forcing small and medium-sized farmers to reduce their cultivated land, resulting in reduced agricultural production, will undoubtedly alleviate the crisis of overproduction and raise the price of agricultural products. However, in this way, the real beneficiaries are obviously not those small and medium-sized farmers in "extremely difficult" situations, but those agricultural capitalists who pursue maximum profits.

    艾森豪威尔的妙计
    艾森豪威尔16日向美国国会提出了农业政策咨文，他为“解救”美国日益严重的农业危机想了一条“妙计”。他说：美国政府今后一个重要的政策措施是加强使中小农民缩小耕地的面积的计划，以这种强制削减农业生产的办法来防止处境“极其困难”的美国农民的处境进一步恶化。
    此中奥妙，确实令人很难领会。强迫中小农民缩小耕地，造成农业减产，无疑将会缓和生产过剩危机，抬高农产品的价格。不过这样一来，真正得到好处的显然不是那些处境“极其困难”的中小农民，而是那些追求最大利润的农业资本家。
