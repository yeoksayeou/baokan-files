Xinhua News Agency, 3rd January: Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Xuan reports: The data obtained from geological surveys during the First Five-Year Plan prove that China is a country with very rich underground resources of all kinds. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed the task of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products in about the next fifteen years, and from the perspective of resources, this can be fully guaranteed with continued efforts.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, China explored forty-one kinds of mineral raw materials that are of great importance to industrialization, and the currently known reserves greatly exceed the estimates made before liberation. According to preliminary materials provided by relevant departments, China's reserves of tungsten, tin, and molybdenum are currently the largest in the world. The prospective coal reserves are one trillion tons, second only to the Soviet Union and the United States, ranking third in the world. There are 560 known iron ore producing areas. Estimating from the main producing areas, the ore reserves are at least 12 billion tons, nearly five times more than the estimates before liberation, ranking seventh in the world and second in Asia. In addition, minerals such as manganese, magnesium, copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, sulfur, and phosphorus are also very abundant.

Geologists in imperialist countries once asserted that China was a country lacking copper, but at present, there are more than 2,500 known copper deposit locations in China. Among them, the confirmed reserves of just three large copper mines in North China, Southwest China, and Central South China each exceed the estimated national reserves by the Central Geological Survey of the Kuomintang government.

As for manganese, an important raw material for the steel industry, the reserves currently controlled by China are more than ten times the estimates before liberation.

On the basis of the general survey work, geological departments in China also carried out unprecedented exploration work during the First Five-Year Plan period, providing the state with a large number of geological data for design and exploitation. At present, most of the 28 kinds of mineral raw materials such as iron, manganese, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, coal, petroleum, and phosphorus listed in the Five-Year Plan for exploration have exceeded the industrial exploitable reserves stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. The industrial reserves of iron ore required by the First Five-Year Plan were 2.47 billion tons, and are expected to reach 4.4 billion tons, exceeding the target by 80%. The industrial reserves of coal required by the First Five-Year Plan were 20.27 billion tons, and are expected to reach 32.5 billion tons, exceeding the target by more than 60%. If these industrial reserves obtained during the First Five-Year Plan are calculated based on Britain's 1956 production level—an annual output of 13.17 million tons of pig iron and 220 million tons of coal—China's industrial reserves of iron ore can be mined for at least 100 years, and the industrial reserves of coal can be mined for 110 years.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, Chinese geological personnel also discovered many new mineral deposits. The important ones include the large iron ore deposits discovered in Northwest and Southwest China, copper deposits discovered in North China, Central South China and other places, molybdenum deposits in Northeast and Northwest China, lead-zinc deposits in the Qaidam Basin, chromite deposits in Qinghai, phosphate deposits in Hubei, and the Karamay oil field in Xinjiang, etc. Among these new mineral deposits, some not only have large prospective reserves, but have also been confirmed to have huge exploitation value, which is of great significance for promoting China's industrial development. For example, the Jingtieshan iron mine in the Qilian Mountains and the Panzhihua iron mine on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan, the currently proven part of the reserves alone is enough to build two large-scale iron and steel joint enterprises with an annual output of more than 1.5 million tons, and there are abundant metallurgical auxiliary raw material producing areas nearby, making them more suitable areas for building iron and steel bases in Northwest and Southwest China. The discovery of the Karamay oil field and the eruption of crude oil from many structures in the Qaidam Basin further negated the slanderous remarks of bourgeois scholars that "China is poor in oil." Now, the proven oilfield area of the Karamay oil field alone is several times larger than that of China's original largest oil field—the Yumen Laojunmiao oil field.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, China also discovered many rare metal mineral deposits. The discovery of these mineral deposits is of great significance for the development of China's new industries and the adoption of new technologies.

China also has many inland salt lakes and salt mines. According to chemical analysis, these salt lakes contain a variety of useful elements, which can be used in the future to make up for several minerals that China still lacks.

When a person in charge of a relevant department introduced the above situation to Xinhua News Agency reporters, he pointed out that according to geological data published by various countries in the world, there are few countries with such rich resources of various kinds as China. Although the United States in the capitalist camp has relatively abundant coal, iron, copper, and oil resources, it lacks minerals such as manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, tin, aluminum, mercury, asbestos, and diamonds. Generally speaking, Britain only has relatively more coal resources, but according to the data published by the Fifth World Power Conference, the total possible buried amount of British coalfields is only 173.9 billion tons, only 17% of the prospective reserves of China's coalfields. Britain's iron ore resources are even more scarce. The proven industrial reserves are only 2.4 billion tons, and the prospective reserves are only 3.8 billion tons, equivalent to 31.6% of China's already controlled prospective iron ore reserves, and the grade is very low, with most containing only about 30% iron.

### 我国地下到处是宝  钨锡钼矿世界第一  煤铁储量远超英国

    我国地下到处是宝
    钨锡钼矿世界第一  煤铁储量远超英国
    新华社3日讯　新华社记者罗漩报道：经过第一个五年计划地质勘探获得的资料证明，我国是各种地下资源都非常丰富的国家。中共中央提出争取今后十五年左右在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的任务，从资源方面来说，只要继续努力是完全可以保证的。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国共计勘探了四十一种同工业化有着重大关系的矿产原料，目前已知的储量都大大超过解放以前曾经作过的估计。根据有关部门提供的初步材料，目前我国的钨、锡、钼的储量都居世界第一位。煤的远景储量是一万亿吨，仅次于苏联和美国，占世界第三位。已知的铁矿产地有五百六十个，以其中主要产地估计，矿石储量至少有一百二十亿吨，超过解放前的估计将近五倍，占世界第七位，亚洲第二位。此外，像锰、镁、铜、铝、铅、锌、硫、磷等矿藏也都很丰富。
    帝国主义国家的地质学者曾经断言我国是一个缺铜的国家，但是目前我国已知的铜矿点就有二千五百多个。其中只是在华北、西南和中南经过勘探而证实的三个大铜矿，每个矿的储量都超过了国民党政府中央地质调查所所估计的全国储量。
    作为炼钢工业重要原料的锰，目前我国掌握的储量也已经超过解放以前估计的十倍以上。
    在普查工作的基础上，我国各地质部门在第一个五年计划期间还进行了规模空前的勘探工作，为国家提供了大批可供设计开采的地质资料。现在，列入五年计划勘探的铁、锰、铜、铅、锌、钼、钨、煤、石油、磷等二十八种矿产原料，绝大部分都超额完成了第一个五年计划任务规定的具有工业开采价值的储量。铁矿在第一个五年计划中规定要求获得的工业储量是二十四亿七千万吨，预计达到四十四亿吨，超额80％。第一个五年计划要求获得的煤的工业储量是二百零二亿七千万吨，预计完成三百二十五亿吨，超额60％以上。这些在第一个五年计划内获得的工业储量，如果以英国1956年的生产水平——生铁年产一千三百一十七万吨，煤年产二亿二千万吨计算，我国铁矿的工业储量至少可以开采一百年，煤矿工业储量可供开采一百一十年。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国的地质人员还发现了很多新的矿产地。重要的有在西北和西南发现的大型铁矿，华北、中南等地发现的铜矿，东北和西北的钼矿，柴达木盆地的铅锌矿，青海的铬铁矿，湖北的磷矿，以及新疆的克拉玛依油田等等。这些新的矿产地中，有的不但远景储量很大，而且已证实具有巨大的开采价值，对促进我国的工业发展有着重要意义。如在祁连山区和川滇边境的镜铁山铁矿和攀枝花铁矿，仅目前已经探明的一部分储量，就足够建设两个年产一百五十万吨以上的大型钢铁联合企业的需要，而且附近都有着丰富的冶金辅助原料产地，是西北和西南两地建设钢铁基地比较适宜的地区。克拉玛依油田的发现和柴达木盆地许多构造的喷出原油，更进一步否定了资产阶级学者认为“中国贫油”的谰言。现在只是克拉玛依油田已经探明的油田面积，就比我国原来最大的油田——玉门老君庙油田面积大好几倍。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国还发现了很多稀有金属矿产地。这些矿产地的发现，对发展我国的新工业和采用新技术有着非常重要的意义。
    我国的内陆盐湖和盐矿也很多。据化验证明，这些盐湖中都含有多种有用元素，将来加以利用以后，可以弥补几种我国还缺乏的矿产。
    据有关部门负责人向新华社记者介绍以上情况时指出，根据世界各国已经公布的地质资料，像我国这样各种资源都很丰富的国家是少有的。资本主义阵营的美国虽然拥有比较丰富的煤、铁、铜、石油资源，但是缺乏锰、铬、镍、钨、锡、铝、汞、石棉、金刚石等矿藏。英国一般说来只有煤矿资源比较多，可是根据第五届世界动力会议公布的资料，英国煤田的可能总埋藏量也只有一千七百三十九亿吨，只及我国煤田远景储量的17％。英国铁矿的资源更为贫乏，已经探明的工业储量只有二十四亿吨，远景储量也只有三十八亿吨，相当于我国已经掌握的铁矿远景储量的31.6％，而且品位很低，大部分含铁量只有30％左右。
