Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei Province's manure collection campaign has entered a full-scale climax. As of recently, the region has collected 4 billion dan of fertilizer, accounting for 45% of the province's planned manure collection for this winter and spring.

The manure collection upsurge in Hubei Province rapidly formed after nearly half of the province's water conservancy projects were completed. Now the scale of the manure collection campaign has caught up with the scale of water conservancy construction, especially since the beginning of January, the manure collection campaign has progressed very rapidly. Xiaogan Prefecture, in its statistics for early January, only collected 620 million dan of fertilizer, but in the week after the 11th, it accumulated an additional 310 million dan. Huanggang Prefecture had accumulated only 1.2 billion dan of fertilizer in early January, but by January 18, statistics showed that the region had completed 1.8 billion dan of fertilizer collection. Yicheng and Xiangyang counties in Xiangyang Prefecture have recently exceeded their original planned manure collection figures for the winter and spring seasons ahead of schedule.

The manure collection campaign in Hubei Province is being carried out in close conjunction with the "Eliminate the Four Pests, Promote Hygiene" campaign. Thousands of medium-sized and small towns and small marketplaces throughout the province have successively invested in a hygiene and manure collection campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. In rural areas, the focus is on combining the basic construction of manure collection centered on "Five-Have" (cows have pens, pigs have sties, people have toilets, production teams have manure pits, and fields have fertilizer storage) with the patriotic health campaign. At present, in addition to Huangmei, Huangpi, Tongshan, Tongcheng and other counties that have basically achieved "Five-Have," about 15,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have also achieved "Five-Have."

In order to improve the quality of manure, many places have launched major inspections and comparisons of manure collection.

    湖北积肥运动进展迅速
    黄梅黄陂通山等县实现“五有化”
    据新华社武汉讯　湖北省积肥运动已进入全面高潮。到最近止，各地已积肥四十亿担，占全省去冬今春积肥计划的45％。
    湖北省的积肥高潮是在全省水利工程完成近半数后迅速形成的。现在积肥运动的规模已经赶上修水利的规模，特别是从1月上旬以来，积肥运动进展十分迅速。孝感专区在1月上旬统计仅积肥六亿二千万担，但在11日以后的一周间就增积了三亿一千万担。黄冈专区1月上旬累计积肥仅十二亿担，到1月18日统计全区已完成积肥十八亿担。襄阳专区的宜城、襄阳两县已在最近提前超额完成原定冬春两季的积肥规划数字。
    湖北省的积肥运动是密切结合“除四害、讲卫生”运动开展起来的。全省数千个中、小城镇和小街市先后都投入了以除四害为中心的卫生积肥运动。在农村中，主要是把“五有”（牛有栏、猪有圈、人有厕所、生产队有粪窖、田头有肥壋）为中心的积肥基本建设和爱国卫生运动结合起来。目前，除黄梅、黄陂、通山、通城等县基本“五有化”了以外，全省还约有一万五千个农业社已实现了“五有”。
    为了提高积肥质量，许多地方开展了积肥评比大检查。
