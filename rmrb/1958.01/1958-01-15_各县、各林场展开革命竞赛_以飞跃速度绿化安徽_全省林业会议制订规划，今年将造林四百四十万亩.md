Various Counties and Forestry Centers Launch Revolutionary Competition
    To Greening Anhui at Flying Speed
    Provincial Forestry Conference Formulates Plan to Afforest 4.4 Million Mu This Year

    (Our newspaper, Hefei, January 14th) At the recent Anhui Provincial Forestry Work Conference, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on everyone to exert great efforts to rapidly green Anhui, and to ensure that water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, greening, and the elimination of the four pests are carried out simultaneously and developed together.

    Currently, while vigorously engaging in water conservancy construction, the entire province is carrying out greening work at a flying speed. The province-wide winter afforestation has reached more than 930,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by more than one time, and is more than 2.6 times the actual total of winter afforestation in 1955 and 1956. In the Hepeng District of Shucheng County, 60,000 people have been投入 into the afforestation movement, with an average of 1.3 mu of afforestation per person. Fuyang and Taihe counties, in the process of repairing the Ying River levee project, planted trees while restoring the levee. By the end of the project, more than 510,000 trees had been planted.

    At the Anhui Provincial Forestry Work Conference held from December 15th to 28th, 1957, a preliminary plan for the development of forestry in the province was initially formulated, requiring the afforestation of 4.4 million mu this year, equivalent to 56.7% of the province's afforestation area during the first five-year plan period.

    The province's forestry production workers are full of confidence in successfully completing this task, and a competition upsurge to accelerate greening work has now been launched. Wuhu, Anqing, and Liuan Special Districts and most of the counties under their jurisdiction, as well as forestry centers, horticultural farms, and forestry work stations throughout the province, have launched competitions with each other. Huoshan County has proposed five conditions to Jinzhai County, including vigorously implementing the principle of "self-seed collection, self-seedling cultivation, and self-afforestation," adopting strip and fish-scale block land preparation methods, and overfulfilling this year's afforestation tasks. He County proposed to Wuwei and Chao County the goal of transforming villages and homesteads into forest gardens within three years and turning barren mountains into forest mountains and fruit mountains within five years. Eight mountainous counties, including Jingxian and Xiuning, warmly responded to the proposal made by Shexian County to ensure no forest fires. Jingxian County, which is most severely affected by pine caterpillars, also guarantees to eliminate pine caterpillars this year. All forestry centers and horticultural farms have expressed their determination in the challenges and responses to build Anhui into a large garden with "a peach blossom shop every five miles, an apricot blossom village every ten miles, with green trees, red fruits, birds singing, and flowers fragrant."

    各县、各林场展开革命竞赛
    以飞跃速度绿化安徽
    全省林业会议制订规划，今年将造林四百四十万亩
    本报合肥14日电　在最近召开的安徽省林业工作会议上，中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志号召大家，拿出一股干劲来，迅速绿化安徽，要做到水利、积肥、绿化、除四害这四项工作齐头并进，同时发展。
    目前全省在大力兴修水利的同时，正以飞跃的速度进行绿化工作。全省冬季造林已达九十三万多亩，超过原计划的一倍多，为1955、1956年两年冬季造林实际总和的二点六倍多。舒城县河棚区有六万人投入造林运动，平均每人造林一点三亩。阜阳、太和两县在修复颍河大堤工程中，一面复堤，一面植树，工程结束时，已栽树五十一万多棵。
    在1957年12月15日到28日召开的安徽省林业工作会议上，全省发展林业的初步规划已经初步制定，要求在今年造林四百四十万亩，相当于第一个五年计划期间全省造林面积的56.7％。
    全省的林业生产工作者对胜利完成这一任务信心百倍，目前已掀起了一个加速绿化工作的竞赛热潮。芜湖、安庆、六安三个专区和所属的大部分县，全省的林场、园艺场、林业工作站相互之间，都展开了竞赛。霍山县提出大力贯彻“自采种、自育种、自造林”的方针，采用带状和鱼鳞式的块状整地法，超额完成今年造林任务等五个条件，向金寨县提出挑战。和县向无为、巢县提出挑战的目标是三年内使村庄宅园变林园，五年内荒山变林山、花果山。泾县、休宁等八个山区县热烈响应歙县提出保证无森林火灾的倡议。松毛虫危害最严重的泾县，还保证在今年内消灭松毛虫。各个林场和园艺场在挑战应战中都表示了决心，要把安徽建设成“五里一个桃花店，十里一个杏花村，绿树红果，鸟语花香”的大花园。
