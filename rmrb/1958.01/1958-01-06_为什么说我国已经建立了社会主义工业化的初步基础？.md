Why is it said that our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization?
    Kong Sang

    Someone asked: Why is it said that our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization?
    Before answering this question, we must first explain the main signs of socialist industrialization in our country.
    As a populous country with large needs and abundant resources, our country's socialist industrialization must build a basically complete industrial system. Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in the "Report on the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The main requirement for socialist industrialization in our country is to basically build a complete industrial system in about three five-year plan periods. Such an industrial system can produce various major machinery and equipment and raw materials, basically meeting the needs of expanded reproduction and technological transformation of the national economy in our country. At the same time, it can also produce various consumer goods to appropriately meet the needs of the continuous improvement of people's living standards."
    Heavy industry is the backbone of the entire industry. To build a basically complete industrial system, we must first have relatively fully developed and mutually coordinated modern heavy industrial sectors, such as: metallurgical industry, fuel industry, power industry, machine manufacturing industry, basic chemical industry, building materials industry, etc.; in terms of the requirements of modern industrial development, there must also be atomic energy industry and radio industry and other departments. In the process of realizing socialist industrialization, we must adhere to the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, with economic construction centered on heavy industry. We should not only generally develop various basic heavy industrial sectors, but also especially establish and strengthen heavy industrial sectors that are currently blank or weak, so that machinery and equipment and raw materials can be basically self-sufficient, ensuring the needs of socialist expanded reproduction, ensuring the needs of technological transformation of the national economy, and ensuring the needs of the increasing modernization of national defense.
    Due to its vast territory, to build a basically complete industrial system, our country must also establish several powerful industrial bases. These industrial bases themselves should have relative independence to meet the requirements of national defense security and regional balance, and at the same time, they should divide labor and cooperate with each other to maximize production effectiveness.
    A complete industrial system undoubtedly requires relatively strong technical forces and relatively high technical levels, capable of undertaking the arduous tasks of geological exploration, construction project design and construction, and new product design and manufacturing by relying on domestic forces.
    We are implementing socialist industrialization, so we must develop state-owned industry as much as possible, and at the same time transform private industry with socialist principles, and gradually make socialist industry under the ownership by the whole people and collective ownership occupy an absolute advantage in the entire industry, and even become the only economic component.
    Industrial production occupying a major position in social production, heavy industrial production occupying a significant advantage in the entire industrial production, and socialist industry becoming the only economic component in the entire industry are the inevitable results of establishing a basically complete industrial system.
    We have all the favorable domestic and international conditions to build a basically complete industrial system in our country within three five-year plans or a little longer, and realize socialist industrialization.
    In the process of realizing socialist industrialization in our country, when industry develops rapidly, other economic sectors must be developed accordingly, and agriculture must be developed accordingly first. As the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized, our policy is: on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, we should develop industry and agriculture simultaneously. Experience has proved that this is a correct path to industrialization.
    Our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization, which is manifested in the following aspects:
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, our country concentrated its main efforts on industrial construction centered on the 156 construction units designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union, which were composed of 694 construction units above the quota. Of the 156 major projects designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union, more than 130 were started during the First Five-Year Plan, of which 57 have been fully or partially completed and put into production; of the 694 construction units above the quota that started construction during the First Five-Year Plan, the actual number reached 825, of which about 450 have been fully or partially completed and put into production. These industrial enterprises are all large in scale and technically new, many of which our country has never had before. The 450 industrial enterprises that have been completed have established the first batch of backbones for our country's industrialization. This batch of backbones has provided huge production capacity for our country's industry. During the First Five-Year Plan, the production capacity increased by the central competent departments due to investment alone was: more than 2.8 million tons of pig iron, more than 2.2 million tons of steel, more than 2 million kilowatts of power generation capacity, more than 52 million tons of coal, more than 70,000 tons of metallurgical machinery and mining machinery, 30,000 trucks, more than 300,000 tons of sulfuric acid, more than 2.4 million tons of cement, more than 1.3 million cotton spindles, more than 130,000 tons of machine-made paper, and more than 150,000 tons of machine-made sugar. Most of these production capacities exceeded all the production capacity accumulated by old China in nearly a hundred years. For example, the production capacity of steel in old China was less than 2 million tons at its highest (less than 1 million tons utilized), while our country increased by more than 2 million tons in the First Five-Year Plan. And when all 825 construction units above the quota that started construction during the First Five-Year Plan are all completed during the Second Five-Year Plan, the production capacity they increase will be much larger than the above figures.
    With the completion of 450 industrial construction units above the quota, our country has not only generally strengthened the modern iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, power industry, coal mining industry, petroleum industry, machine manufacturing industry and building materials industry, and improved the production volume of our country's industry, but more importantly, our country has established many new industrial sectors that have never existed before, thereby initially changing the incomplete and uncoordinated state of our country's industry in the past. Before the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, our country's machine manufacturing industry only had the ability to manufacture accessories and small machines, and did not have the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment, mining equipment and power generation equipment, nor the manufacturing of airplanes, automobiles and tractors. The complete sets of equipment and important machines necessary for national construction had to rely on imports to solve. Our country's metallurgical industry not only had low output, but also had very few varieties, and many important metal materials also had to rely on imports to solve. And now, as Comrade Li Fuchun announced at the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union: Our country has become a country with airplane manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, high-efficiency steam locomotive manufacturing, new machine tool manufacturing, power generation equipment manufacturing, metallurgical and mining equipment manufacturing, and advanced alloy steel and important non-ferrous metal smelting industries. In 1952, our country could only produce more than 180 kinds of steel and more than 400 specifications of steel products, and the types of machine tools were also very few. In 1957, our country was able to produce more than 370 kinds of steel and more than 3,000 specifications of steel products, and the types of machine tools also increased by about 200 kinds; many complete sets of equipment have also been able to manufacture themselves.
    During the First Five-Year Plan, our country basically built the Northeast Industrial Base centered on the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex. This industrial base has various types of heavy industry and various types of light industry, and has more than ten large industrial cities. The steel production of Anshan Iron and Steel alone accounts for more than half of the country's steel production. During this period, we also greatly strengthened the industrial foundations of coastal cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin. Shanghai's total industrial output value increased by nearly one time in five years. Our country's Central China Industrial Base centered on the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, the North China (Inner Mongolia) Industrial Base with the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex as the backbone, and the new industrial zone in the Northwest all started large-scale construction during the First Five-Year Plan; at the same time, partial industrial construction also started in the Southwest and South China regions. The construction and strengthening of all these industrial bases and industrial zones has begun to change the original unreasonable distribution of our country's industry, and has made it possible for us to rely on a much stronger industrial foundation than in 1952, especially the Northeast Industrial Base, to develop the construction of inland industries more quickly.
    During the First Five-Year Plan, our country built a large number of new industrial enterprises on the one hand, and transformed the original industrial enterprises on the other hand, either by renovating and expanding them, or by adjusting and adding equipment, and adopted new technical organizational measures, thereby greatly increasing production capacity.
    The great development of industry during the First Five-Year Plan strengthened and trained our country's technical forces. As everyone knows, the weakness of technical forces and the low level of technology were one of the great difficulties our country encountered at the beginning of planned construction. However, after five years of efforts, we have initially overcome this difficulty. During this period, the number of surveying and design technicians in our country's basic construction departments increased by seven times, the number of construction and installation technicians increased by 3.4 times, and the number of technicians in industrial production departments increased by 2.6 times. In 1957, the total number of these three types of technicians reached approximately 600,000. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts and the conscientious study of Soviet advanced experience, the technical level of our country's technicians has been greatly improved in the process of practical work. Now, except for some geological conditions that are more complex and technical conditions that require very high standards, all large and medium-sized construction projects, including various industrial, railway, and water conservancy projects, can be designed and constructed by ourselves. Many types of important industrial products have begun to transition from the stage of imitation to the stage of self-design.
    The large-scale construction of our country's industry and the rapid development of state-owned industry are being carried out simultaneously with the socialist transformation of private industry. Since capitalist industry was completely transformed into joint state-private ownership in 1956, and the vast majority of private small industry and individual handicrafts have also turned to cooperativization, the structure of our country's industrial economy has also undergone fundamental changes. At the end of 1956, in the total industrial output value including handicrafts, the state-owned economy accounted for 54.5%, the cooperative economy accounted for 13%, the joint state-private economy accounted for 27.2%, the capitalist economy was completely eliminated, and the remaining non-socialist economic nature was only 5.3% of individual handicrafts. By the end of 1957, the proportion of state-owned industry had further increased.
    The rapid development of our country's industry, especially heavy industry, has caused the following changes in proportions. In 1957 compared to 1952: the proportion of total industrial output value in the total output value of industry and agriculture has increased from 41.5% to 55.5%; the proportion of total modern industrial output value in the total output value of industry and agriculture has increased from 26.7% to about 40%; the proportion of the output value of the means of production industry in the total industrial output value has increased from 39.7% to about 52%; the proportion of the output value of the machine manufacturing industry (excluding the output value of the metal processing industry) in the total industrial output value has increased from 5.2% to more than 9%. Importantly: the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment in our country during the First Five-Year Plan reached more than 60%; the self-sufficiency rate of steel reached more than 80%, both of which were higher than in 1952. It should be pointed out that the improvement of our country's self-sufficiency capacity in machinery and equipment and raw materials has been realized under the condition of increasingly expanding construction scale. In 1952, our country only had a small amount of new construction, while in 1957, the amount of construction and installation work in our country's basic construction increased by more than two times compared to 1952.
    From the above series of changes, a natural conclusion can be drawn: Our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization.
    Of course, compared with industrialized countries, and compared with the huge domestic needs, our country's current industrial level is still very low. We must go through another two five-year plans or a little longer of arduous construction to establish a basically complete industrial system, realize the country's socialist industrialization, and further catch up with or exceed the level of the United Kingdom in terms of the output of steel and other important products when the Fourth Five-Year Plan is completed. We must do this, and we will definitely be able to do this. The victorious completion of our country's First Five-Year Plan has not only enhanced the confidence of the people across the country in building socialism, but has also laid a solid foundation for the great cause of socialism. Relying on this foundation, we will be able to more powerfully promote the further development of various sectors of the national economy.

    为什么说我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础？
    孔桑
    有人问：为什么说我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础？
    在回答这个问题之前，必须首先说明我国社会主义工业化的主要标志。
    作为一个人口众多、需要很大并且资源丰富的国家，我国实现社会主义工业化，必须建成一个基本上完整的工业体系。周恩来同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告”中指出：“我国社会主义工业化的主要要求，就是要在大约三个五年计划时期内，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系。这样的工业体系，能够生产各种主要的机器设备和原材料，基本上满足我国扩大再生产和国民经济技术改造的需要。同时，它也能够生产各种消费品，适当地满足人民生活水平不断提高的需要。”
    重工业是整个工业的骨干。要建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，首先必须有比较充分发展的和互相配合发展的现代重工业各部门，如：冶金工业，燃料工业，电力工业，机器制造工业，基本化学工业，建筑材料工业等等；以现代工业发展的要求来说，还必须有原子能工业和无线电工业等部门。我们在实现社会主义工业化的过程中，必须坚持优先发展重工业的方针，经济建设以重工业为中心。我们不仅应当一般地发展各个基本的重工业部门，而且应当特别地建立和加强目前还空白的或者薄弱的重工业部门，使机器设备和原材料能够基本上自给，保证社会主义扩大再生产的需要，保证国民经济技术改造的需要，并且保证国防日益现代化的需要。
    我国由于地域广阔，要建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，还必须建立几个强大的工业基地。这些工业基地，本身应当具有相对的独立性，以适应国防安全和地区平衡的要求，同时又应当彼此分工和互相配合，以发挥最大的生产效果。
    完整的工业体系无疑要求有比较强大的技术力量和比较高的技术水平，能够依靠国内的力量担负起地质的勘察、建设工程的设计和施工、新产品的设计和制造等艰巨任务。
    我们实行的是社会主义的工业化，因此必须尽可能发展国营工业，同时用社会主义的原则改造私营工业，逐步地使全民所有制的和集体所有制的社会主义工业在整个工业中占绝对的优势，以至成为唯一的经济成分。
    工业生产在社会生产中占主要地位，重工业生产在整个工业生产中占显著的优势，以及社会主义工业在整个工业中成为唯一的经济成分，这是建立一个基本上完整的工业体系的必然结果。
    我们有国内和国际的一切有利条件，使我国在三个五年计划或者再多一点的时间内建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，实现社会主义的工业化。
    我国在实现社会主义工业化的过程中，当工业迅速发展的时候，必须使其他各个经济部门得到相应的发展，首先是农业得到相应的发展。正像党中央和毛泽东同志强调地指出的，我们的方针是：在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举。经验证明，这是一条正确的工业化道路。
    我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，表现在哪些方面呢？
    我国在第一个五年计划期间，集中主要力量进行了以苏联帮助设计的一百五十六个建设单位为中心的、由限额以上的六百九十四个建设单位组成的工业建设。苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六项重大工程，在第一个五年内开始施工的是一百三十多项，其中有五十七项已经全部或部分建成并且投入生产；在第一个五年内开始施工的全部限额以上工程原定为六百九十四项，实际上达到了八百二十五项，其中约有四百五十项已经全部或部分建成并且投入生产。这一批工业企业，规模都很大，技术都很新，许多是我国过去所从来没有的。已经建成的四百五十个工业企业，为我国的工业化树立了第一批骨干。这批骨干为我国工业提供了巨大的生产能力。第一个五年计划期间仅中央主管部门由投资而增加的生产能力就有：生铁二百八十多万吨，钢二百二十多万吨，发电容量二百多万瓩，煤五千二百多万吨，冶金机械和矿山机械七万多吨，载重汽车三万辆，硫酸三十多万吨，水泥二百四十多万吨，棉纺绽一百三十多万枚，机制纸十三万多吨，机制糖十五万多吨。这些生产能力，其中大多数超过了旧中国近百年来所积累的全部生产能力，例如钢的生产能力，旧中国最高的数字不到二百万吨（利用的不到一百万吨），而我国在第一个五年内就增加了二百多万吨。而当第一个五年计划开工建设的所有八百二十五个限额以上的建设单位在第二个五年计划期内全部建成以后，它们增加的生产能力要比上列数字大得多。
    随着四百五十个限额以上的工业建设单位的建成，我国不仅一般地加强了现代化的钢铁工业、有色金属工业、电力工业、煤矿工业、石油工业、机器制造工业和建筑材料工业，提高了我国工业的生产量，而且重要的还在于我国建立了许多以前从来没有过的新的工业部门，从而初步地改变了我国工业过去残缺不全和互不配合的状态。我国在实行第一个五年计划以前，机器制造工业只有制造配件和小型机器的能力，没有冶金设备、采矿设备和发电设备的制造业，也没有飞机、汽车和拖拉机的制造业，国家建设所必需的成套设备和重要的机器，都要依靠进口来解决。我国的冶金工业不仅产量低，而且品种很少，许多重要的金属材料也要依靠进口来解决。而现在，正像李富春同志在中国工会第八次全国代表大会上所宣布的：我国已经变成为一个具有飞机制造业、汽车制造业、高效率蒸汽机车制造业、新式机床制造业、发电设备制造业、冶金和矿山设备制造业及高级合金钢、重要有色金属冶炼业的国家了。我国在1952年只能够生产一百八十多种钢和四百多种规格的钢材，机床的种类也很少，而在1957年，我国已经能够生产三百七十多种钢和三千多种规格的钢材，机床的种类也大约增加了二百多种；许多成套设备也已经能够自己制造了。
    我国在第一个五年计划期间，基本上建成了以鞍山钢铁联合企业为中心的东北工业基地。这个工业基地拥有各类重工业和各类轻工业，有十个以上大工业城市，仅鞍钢一个企业，钢的生产量就占了全国钢产量的一半以上。在这期间，我们也大大地加强了上海、天津等沿海城市的工业基础，五年内上海的工业总产量即增长了将近一倍。我国以武汉钢铁联合企业为中心的华中工业基地，以包头钢铁联合企业为骨干的华北（内蒙古）工业基地，和西北的新工业区，都在第一个五年计划期间开始了大规模的建设；同时，在西南地区和华南地区，也开始了部分的工业建设。所有这些工业基地和工业区的建设和加强，使我国工业原来分布不合理的状态开始有所改变，并且使我们有可能依靠比1952年强大得多的工业基础，特别是东北工业基地，来更快地发展内地工业的建设。
    我国在第一个五年计划期间，一方面建设了大批的新工业企业，另一方面改造了原有的工业企业，或者进行改建和扩建，或者调整和增加设备，采取了新的技术组织措施，从而大大地增加了生产能力。
    第一个五年计划期间工业的大发展壮大了和锻炼了我国的技术力量。大家知道，技术力量薄弱和技术水平低下曾经是我国在有计划建设初期所遇到的巨大困难之一。可是，经过五年的努力，我们已经初步地克服了这种困难。在这期间，我国基本建设部门的勘察、设计技术人员增加了七倍，建筑安装的技术人员增加了三点四倍，工业生产部门的技术人员增加了二点六倍，在1957年，这三类技术人员的总数大约达到了六十万人。我国的技术人员由于得到了苏联专家的指导和帮助，认真地学习了苏联的先进经验，在实际工作的锻炼过程中，技术水平已经有了很大的提高。现在，除了某些地质条件比较复杂和技术条件要求很高的以外，所有大中型的建设工程，包括各类工业和铁路、水利等工程在内，都可以自己进行设计和施工了。各类重要的工业产品，有许多已经由仿造的阶段开始向自己设计的阶段过渡。
    我国工业的大规模建设，国营工业的迅速发展，是同对私营工业的社会主义改造同时进行的。由于资本主义工业在1956年已经全部转变为公私合营，私营小工业和个体手工业的绝大部分也已经转向合作化，我国工业经济的结构也就发生了根本的变化。1956年底在包括手工业在内的工业总产值中，国营经济已经占54.5％，合作经济占13％，公私合营经济占27.2％，资本主义经济已全部消灭，剩下的非社会主义性质的经济只有5.3％的个体手工业。到1957年底，国营工业的比重已进一步有了提高。
    我国工业特别是重工业迅速发展的结果，引起了如下一些比重的变化，1957年比1952年：工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重，已经由41.5％上升为55.5％；现代工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重，已经由26.7％上升为40％左右；生产资料工业产值在工业总产值中的比重，已经由39.7％上升为52％左右；机器制造工业的产值（不包括金属加工工业的产值）在工业总产值中的比重，已经由5.2％上升为9％以上。重要的还在于：我国第一个五年计划期间的机器设备自给率，达到了60％以上；钢材的自给率达到了80％以上，都比1952年有所提高。应当指出，我国的机器设备和原材料的自给能力的提高，是在建设规模日益扩大的情况下实现的。在1952年，我国只有少量的新建设，而在1957年，我国基本建设的建筑安装工作量比1952年增长了二倍以上。
    从上面一系列的变化可以自然地得出一个结论：我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。
    诚然，比之工业发达的国家，比之国内的巨大需要，我国目前的工业水平还是很低的。我们必须再经过两个五年计划或者再多一点时间的刻苦建设，建立起一个基本上完整的工业体系，实现国家的社会主义工业化，并且进一步在完成第四个五年计划的时候，在钢铁和其他重要产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的水平。我们必须做到这一点，也一定能够做到这一点。我国第一个五年计划的胜利完成，不但增强了全国人民建设社会主义的信心，而且已经为社会主义的伟大事业奠定了一个牢固的基础。依靠这个基础，我们就能够更加有力地促进国民经济各部门的进一步发展。
