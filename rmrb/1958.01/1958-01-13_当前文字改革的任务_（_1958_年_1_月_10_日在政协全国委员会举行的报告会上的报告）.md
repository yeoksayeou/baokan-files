	The Current Tasks of Language Reform
	(Report given on January 10, 1958, at a report meeting held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference)
	Zhou Enlai
		(I)
	The current tasks of language reform are: simplifying Chinese characters, promoting Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese), and formulating and implementing a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.
	First is simplifying Chinese characters. The "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" was announced by the State Council in January 1956. This scheme contains three parts: The first part is the First Table of Simplified Characters, containing 230 simplified characters, which have been in general use since the scheme was announced. The second part is the Second Table of Simplified Characters, containing 285 simplified characters, of which 95 have been in trial use since June 1956. The third part is the Table of Simplified Radicals, containing 54 simplified radicals, from which 30 simplified characters derived by analogy have been in trial use since the scheme was announced. Combining the above three items, there are now a total of 355 simplified characters used in newspapers and periodicals. Since the announcement of the scheme, simplified characters have been widely used in newspapers, magazines, textbooks, and general books for the past two years, and have been welcomed by the broad masses, who find them convenient. They have indeed done a great good, especially for children and adults who are learning to read and write. A teacher in Henan introduced simplified characters to primary school students, saying that the "豐" (fēng) in "豐收" (fēngshōu, bumper harvest) can now be simplified to "丰" (fēng), which is three horizontal strokes and one vertical stroke. The children applauded with joy. A worker in Tianjin said, "I've been trying to learn '盡' (jìn), '邊' (biān), '辦' (bàn)' for half a year, but I can never remember them. Now they are simplified to '尽' (jìn), '边' (biān), '办' (bàn)', and I can remember them immediately." Comrade Li Fenglian has a younger brother who farms in his hometown. He wrote to Li Fenglian, complaining that the peasants generally find Chinese characters difficult to learn. Some commonly used characters by peasants, such as "農" (nóng) in "農民" (nóngmín, farmer), "瑴" (què) in "穀子" (gǔzi, millet), "麵" (miàn) in "麵粉" (miànfěn, flour), "麥" (mài) in "麥子" (màizi, wheat), and even the two characters "雜糧" (záliáng, miscellaneous grains), are all difficult to write. Comrade Li Fenglian sent him a book on simplified Chinese characters. Her younger brother was extremely happy and wrote back, saying, "These new characters are much easier to learn," and even complained that his sister didn't send it to him earlier. Simplified characters are indeed easier to learn and write than traditional characters. Therefore, it is only natural that the broad masses, including workers, peasants, primary school students, and teachers, warmly welcome simplified characters.
	As for intellectuals like us, who have been dealing with Chinese characters for decades, the memories of being reprimanded or even hit on the hand by teachers for writing wrong characters have gradually faded. Therefore, we feel that traditional and simplified characters are the same, and we are not enthusiastic about simplified characters. Some even find them unpleasant and have ideological resistance. On this point, I very much agree with Mr. Li Zhuchen's view. Mr. Li wrote an article for "Chinese Language Reform Monthly." He said: "Whenever the reform of Chinese characters is mentioned, some people raise various reasons to disagree or even resolutely oppose it. For example, some people say, 'Chinese characters are not difficult.' I think these people are like those who 'forget the pain once the sore heals,' forgetting the pain they experienced when they first learned the 'Three Character Classic' and the 'Thousand Character Classic.' I think if these people could recall the pain they experienced when they learned Chinese characters and put themselves in the shoes of children and illiterate people, they might not disagree or resolutely oppose it." Li Zhu also criticized those who oppose the simplification of Chinese characters in his article. He said: After the announcement of the Chinese character simplification scheme, some people said, "We are about to become illiterate." He believes that this kind of sigh and worry is superfluous. Many of the simplified characters are already familiar to people. How could this "become illiterate"? Of course, some characters are relatively unfamiliar, but as long as you use your brain a little, the problem will be solved, and you will never "become illiterate." For the sake of the broad working people and millions of children, intellectuals should use their brains. Therefore, Li Zhu not only agreed to simplify the character 燭 (zhú, candle) to "烛" (zhú), but also agreed to simplify the character 塵 (chén, dust) to "尘" (chén). I think the problem is indeed like this. Since the simplification of Chinese characters is in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people, we intellectuals should actively support this work, rather than passively treat it. We should consider the issue of language reform from the perspective of 600 million people, rather than from personal habits and temporary convenience.
	In the early stages of the rectification campaign, some right-wing elements viciously attacked language reform, saying that the simplification of Chinese characters was messed up, that the masses opposed it, and that the State Council should withdraw its order and revoke the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters." The right-wing elements' attack on language reform was naturally with ulterior motives. They wanted to use this to attack the Party and the government, but they were indeed opposed to language reform. The simplification of Chinese characters is a good thing that is in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people, and the anti-people right-wing elements naturally oppose it. Standing on the position of the broad masses of the people, we should first affirm the work of simplifying Chinese characters. The simplification of Chinese characters is a good thing that is in line with the interests of the masses and is warmly welcomed by the masses. Two years of trial use have also proved that it is effective and should be firmly supported.
	Does that mean that the work of simplifying Chinese characters has no shortcomings? Does that mean that there are no inappropriate simplified characters in the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters"? No, it is not. It should be pointed out that the policy adopted by the work of simplifying Chinese characters, "agreement through common usage, steady progress," is correct and has been proven by the experience of the past two years, but there are still some areas that have not been considered thoroughly in the specific work. Practice has proved that a small number of simplified characters are not appropriate in application, or may cause misunderstanding. These few simplified characters that are not properly simplified and have been proven to have shortcomings in use should be separately stipulated with their simplified forms, or the original traditional forms should be retained. In the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" announced by the State Council in January 1956, in addition to the 230 simplified characters in the First Table of Simplified Characters being announced and promoted, the 285 simplified characters in the Second Table and the 54 simplified radicals in the Third Table are still under solicitation of opinions and have not yet been finalized. Even the 230 simplified characters in the First Table, if there are indeed inappropriate ones, can be made necessary revisions. The Chinese Language Reform Committee is now soliciting opinions from all parties and carrying out the work of sorting out and revising the simplified characters. Everyone can submit their opinions on the simplified characters to the Chinese Language Reform Committee for their consideration, and then further finalize the plan.
	At present, there are still some chaotic phenomena in the use of simplified characters in society. Some people arbitrarily create simplified characters. Apart from the person who recognizes it, almost no one else recognizes it. This phenomenon is naturally not good. This phenomenon of indiscriminate creation of simplified characters should be appropriately controlled. When a person takes notes or writes a private letter, no one can control what kind of characters he writes. However, writing notices or notifications is for everyone to read, so they should abide by unified norms. Especially in printed materials and typed documents, the abuse of simplified characters must be prevented. It is hoped that the press and publication departments and the document work departments will pay attention to this. The existence of some confusion in the use of simplified characters is often used to accuse the Chinese Language Reform Committee. Yes, we can criticize the Language Reform Committee, saying that it has not done enough publicity work on the simplification of Chinese characters and has not controlled the phenomenon of abuse of simplified characters well. But on the other hand, we should also admit that the phenomenon of creating new simplified characters has existed throughout history. The simplified characters that are now generally recognized were also initially created by a few people, and this process cannot be completely stopped in the future.
	From the history of Chinese characters, the existence of multiple forms of a single character has existed since oracle bone inscriptions. If you want to say it's chaotic, then this kind of chaos has "existed since ancient times," at most it's just "more intense today." The main reason for this "more intense today" is that today the broad masses are beginning to master the written language and are urgently demanding to reform the written language. This has never happened in any dynasty in history. The general trend of the evolution of Chinese character forms is simplification. Because Chinese characters are difficult to write, the people have constantly created many simplified characters. Although the rulers of the past dynasties did not recognize them, calling them "incorrect characters" and "vulgar characters," simplified characters still circulated among the people and were welcomed by the masses. Therefore, we should say that long before the establishment of the Language Reform Committee, the people had already been reforming the written language, and the work of the Language Reform Committee was nothing more than collecting, sorting out the creations of the masses, and promoting them after discussion by all parties. At the same time, we also adopted some Japanese-simplified Chinese characters. It can be seen that some confusion in the use of simplified characters is not caused by the work of simplifying Chinese characters, and the formulation of the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" aims to guide this confusion to a unified norm. Only by taking active measures in the work of simplifying Chinese characters can this chaotic phenomenon be gradually changed.
	In addition, there is another question: Will the simplification of Chinese characters hinder the dissemination and love of Chinese calligraphy? I don't think so. Calligraphy is an art, and of course it can be free from the restrictions of Chinese character simplification. Simplified characters are mainly used in printing. We cannot force everyone to write according to the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters." Therefore, the simplification of Chinese characters will not have any adverse impact on Chinese calligraphy art. At the same time, we should also welcome calligraphers to write in simplified Chinese characters to improve the artistic level of simplified characters.

	Second is promoting Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese). There are still very serious dialect differences in the language of the Han nationality in our country. Among them, a large number are problems in the phonetic aspect. People from different regions, if they speak their own dialects, are often not easy to understand each other. Even in the same province, for example, people from southern Fujian and people from northern Fujian, people from southern Jiangsu and people from northern Jiangsu, have difficulty communicating. This dialect difference has brought adverse effects to the political, economic, and cultural life of the people of our country. Northern cadres sometimes have to be transferred to the south, southern college students sometimes have to be assigned to the north, and workers in coastal cities have to go to support industrial construction in the interior—if there is no common language, our construction work will encounter certain difficulties. It often happens that an important report or an important course is greatly hindered from the understanding of the listeners due to the obstruction of dialects. Radio and film are our important propaganda tools, but because Putonghua has not yet been popularized, their effectiveness in dialect areas is bound to be limited. Since liberation, our country has achieved unprecedented unity in history. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the whole country are striving for the common goal of building socialism, and people are increasingly feeling the urgent need to use a common language. Therefore, striving to promote Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation among the Han people in our country is an important political task.
	Since the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955, the work of promoting Putonghua has achieved some results. By the end of 1957, 721,000 Chinese language teachers in primary and secondary schools and normal schools across the country had received Putonghua phonetic training. In primary and secondary schools across the country, a large proportion have already begun to use Putonghua for teaching. More than two million people across the country listen to the Putonghua phonetic teaching broadcasts organized by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. According to Education Minister Zhang Xiruo, when he went to Xi'an for inspection, he found that some primary school students in Xi'an could speak very good Putonghua. This shows that as long as everyone attaches importance to this work and earnestly promotes it, it can achieve results. We hope that the education departments in various places can complete the training of all primary and secondary school Chinese language teachers in a relatively short period of time, so that all primary and secondary schools across the country can universally begin teaching Putonghua.
	Promoting Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation does not require all Han people to be able to speak like Beijing people. This is both impossible and unnecessary. Beijing pronunciation is a standard. Having a standard means having a direction, and everyone can learn from it. However, in specific promotion and teaching work, different requirements should be made for different objects. For example, stricter requirements should be made for broadcasters, film and drama actors, and Chinese language teachers in normal schools, while broader requirements can be made for the general public, and this general requirement need not be made for people over middle age. Only in this way can the resistance to promoting Putonghua be reduced and everyone's confidence and interest in learning Putonghua be improved. Where should Putonghua be promoted? I think it should first be promoted in schools, among children and young people.
	We promote Putonghua in order to eliminate the barriers between dialects, not to prohibit and eliminate dialects. Does promoting Putonghua mean prohibiting or eliminating dialects? Of course not. Dialects will exist for a long time. Dialects cannot be prohibited by administrative orders, nor can they be eliminated by artificial methods. The promotion of Putonghua should distinguish between the elderly and the young, between national activities and local activities, and between today and tomorrow. It cannot be generalized. On the contrary, those who can only speak Putonghua should also learn some local dialects in order to penetrate the working masses in various dialect areas.
	To gradually unify the dialects of the 600 million Han people is an arduous task that must be accomplished through long-term unremitting efforts. How long will it take? It depends on the development of transportation, economy, and culture and our work, but as long as we continue to work earnestly, this task can definitely be accomplished. We should have such confidence. I hope that everyone will do more publicity work to create a social atmosphere conducive to the promotion of Putonghua. We should also hold Putonghua speech contests from time to time, and reward students who speak Putonghua well and teachers who teach well. In short, we should use more methods to publicize and encourage, to change the social atmosphere, so that it is conducive to the promotion of Putonghua.
		(III)
	Third is formulating and promoting a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. First of all, it should be made clear that the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is used to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters and to promote Putonghua. It is not a phonetic writing system to replace Chinese characters. The first use of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Are Chinese characters difficult to learn? Should phonetic alphabets be used to help learning? There are still some different opinions on this issue. Some people say, "Phonetic writing systems are not easy either, and foreign languages are also difficult to learn." This question can only be compared between the same ethnic groups. With phonetic alphabets to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters, it is naturally easier than without phonetic alphabets to annotate the pronunciation. As for foreign languages: After learning Chinese characters for decades, it is natural to feel that foreign languages are more difficult than Chinese characters. Learning another ethnic group's language is always more difficult than learning one's own language. Russian is more difficult to learn, but Russians find Russian easier than English and German. The issue of the difficulty of phonetic writing systems is different from the issue of the difficulty of nationals learning foreign languages and cannot be confused. I think it should be admitted that Chinese characters are difficult to read and write, and therefore difficult to remember. Not to mention children who are just learning Chinese characters, even adults who have been learning for many years still do not recognize many Chinese characters or read them incorrectly. Now we are simplifying the strokes of Chinese characters on the one hand and annotating them with phonetics on the other, aiming to reduce the difficulty of reading and writing Chinese characters and make them easy for the broad masses to master. Using phonetics can improve the teaching efficiency of Chinese characters. This has been proven by the past quick literacy methods and the current experience of teaching phonetic alphabets first in primary schools. It is hoped that after the phonetic alphabet scheme is approved by the National People's Congress, it can be used to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters in primary school Chinese textbooks and literacy textbooks in the Northern dialect area. It can be asserted that primary school literacy education and illiteracy elimination work will be greatly facilitated.
	Secondly, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme can also be used to spell Putonghua as an effective tool for teaching Putonghua. It is not enough to learn Putonghua by relying solely on the ears and mouth. It is easy to forget after learning. There must be a set of phonetic symbols to compile and print phonetic reading materials and phonetic dictionaries for learners to consult and constantly correct their pronunciation. Only then can it be effective. In the past, we did not have a universally popular and satisfactory phonetic tool, which was a major obstacle to the promotion of Putonghua. Now, because the phonetic alphabet scheme has not yet been finalized, phonetic symbols are still being used. However, although phonetic symbols have been around for more than 40 years, and the government in the past also promoted them in primary schools, most people forget them after learning them, and very few people understand them today. In the future, we will adopt the Latin alphabet Chinese phonetic alphabet. This set of alphabets is widely used in science, technology, and other fields. Everyone has many opportunities to use and come into contact with them, and it is not easy to forget after learning them. Therefore, adopting this set of alphabets will be of great benefit to the promotion of Putonghua.
	Thirdly, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme can be used as a common basis for the creation and reform of writing systems by various ethnic minorities. Our country has nearly 50 ethnic groups, many of which do not have their own writing systems, and other ethnic groups that do have writing systems also need to improve them. Among the ethnic groups that already have writing systems, in addition to the Han people using Chinese characters, there are those who use Tibetan alphabets, Mongolian alphabets, Arabic alphabets, Korean Hangul, and other various alphabets. What alphabets should be used as the basis when these fraternal ethnic groups create and reform their writing systems? Can Chinese characters be used as the common basis for the writing systems of all ethnic groups? Some people have tried this in the past, but it has not been successful, proving that this road is impassable. If dozens of ethnic groups each create their own set of alphabets, this will not only be an obstacle to mutual learning and exchange of experience among the people of all ethnic groups, but also the printing, typing, and telegraph equipment will inevitably be set up separately, which will be extremely detrimental to the future development of all ethnic groups in culture and education. Many fraternal ethnic groups have expressed such a desire, that is, to achieve consistency with the Han nationality in alphabets in order to facilitate the exchange of culture, learn Chinese, and absorb Chinese nouns and terms. In the past few years, there was still some indecision about what alphabets to use in Chinese, which also affected the work of creating and reforming writing systems by some fraternal ethnic groups. Now more than a dozen ethnic groups in the Southwest region have created ethnic minority writing systems using Latin alphabets, but they are still not very relieved, because our plan has not yet been finalized. Therefore, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme cannot be delayed any longer, otherwise it will delay other people's affairs. Since Chinese has now decided to use Latin alphabets as phonetic alphabets, the following principle should be established: In the future, when all ethnic groups create or reform their writing systems, they should in principle be based on Latin alphabets and should strive to achieve consistency with the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in the pronunciation and usage of alphabets. It can be predicted that the formulation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme will be of great benefit to the creation and reform of writing systems by all fraternal ethnic groups, as well as to the mutual learning and communication among the people of all ethnic groups in the future.
	Fourthly, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme can help foreigners learn Chinese to promote international cultural exchange. Because our country's position in international affairs is rising, in many countries, especially in socialist fraternal countries and Asian-African friendly countries, more and more people are willing to learn Chinese. The biggest difficulty they encounter is Chinese characters, so they often feel a sense of despair. Now that we have the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, we can use this set of alphabets to compile and print textbooks, dictionaries, and reading materials for people from all countries to learn Chinese, to help them overcome this difficulty. The foreign students' special training class at Peking University used the first draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme for teaching and it was very effective, which shows that the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has great advantages in this regard. Chinese characters and phonetic symbols are far from comparable to it. After foreign friends learn Chinese, they can still rely on this set of phonetic alphabets as a phonetic tool, and then further learn Chinese characters and Chinese, which will definitely be much easier than without phonetic alphabets. This is the function of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in promoting international cultural exchange.
	In addition, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has various other uses, such as being used to transliterate foreign names of people and places and scientific and technical terms, to transliterate Chinese names of people and places in foreign documents and newspapers, and to compile indexes, etc.
	From the above functions of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, we say that the formulation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is a major event in the cultural life of the Chinese people, which is not an exaggeration.
	Chinese characters, starting from oracle bone inscriptions, have a history of 3,400 or 500 years. Over the past 3,000 years, Chinese characters have undergone many changes: the shape of characters has been simplified, new characters have been added, and some old characters have been eliminated. The early Chinese characters were pictographs, and then many pictophonetic characters, or phonetic loan characters, were produced—most of the characters we use now are pictophonetic characters. However, due to the evolution of ancient and modern phonetics, the phonetic components of many pictophonetic characters have lost their phonetic function, such as "江" (jiāng, river) and "河" (hé, river), which are no longer pronounced "工" (gōng) and "可" (kě). Therefore, as Lu Xun said, Chinese characters have become "non-pictographic pictographs and non-phonetic phonetic characters." Since it is not easy to see its pronunciation from the characters, we have to find other ways to remedy it. One way is "direct pronunciation," which is to use character A to annotate the pronunciation of character B, that is, to use homophones to annotate each other. This method often encounters difficulties: sometimes a character does not have a homophone, or although there is a homophone, this character happens to be an obscure character, and annotating it is equivalent to not annotating it. Another way is "fanqie," which is to use two characters to spell a sound: the upper character takes the initial consonant, and the lower character takes the final. The invention of fanqie can be said to be the budding of phonetics. However, because the phonetics in various parts of our country vary greatly, often two characters have the same pronunciation in place A, but different pronunciations in place B, which further increases the chances of divergence and error in direct pronunciation and fanqie. Especially whether it is direct pronunciation or fanqie, you must first recognize many characters, so it is difficult for children and adults who are just learning the written language to master. After the Revolution of 1911, phonetic symbols were produced. This is the first set of phonetic alphabets in China that was officially announced by the state and universally promoted in primary and secondary schools. Phonetic symbols have made certain contributions to literacy education and pronunciation unification. Although phonetic symbols have many shortcomings in today's view (for example, as a common basis for the writing systems of all ethnic minorities and a tool for promoting international cultural exchange, phonetic symbols are obviously far inferior to Latin alphabets), we should affirm the historical achievements of phonetic symbols. Phonetic symbols have also played a pioneering role in the phonetic alphabet movement in the past 40 years. Now this Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, one of its main functions is to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. In this sense, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme inherits the tradition of direct pronunciation, fanqie, and phonetic symbols, and is developed on their basis.
	Another aspect of the historical development of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, namely, using Latin alphabets to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters, has experienced a history of more than 350 years. In 1605, the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci, who came to China, first used Latin alphabets to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. In 1625, another French missionary, Nicolas Trigault, also used Latin alphabets to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters and wrote a "Xiru Ermuzi." Their purpose was to meet the needs of foreigners learning Chinese and Chinese. After the Opium War, more and more merchants and missionaries from imperialist countries came to China. In order to learn Chinese and spread religion, they formulated many different Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes, among which the so-called postal style and Wade-Giles style had the greatest impact. They also used Latin alphabets to formulate phonetic alphabet schemes for various local dialects in our country, among which the vernacular characters of Southern Fujian (that is, the Latin alphabet phonetic alphabet scheme of Xiamen dialect) had the greatest impact. Many books have been published. It is said that even today, many people in the Xiamen area understand this scheme, and many relatives of overseas Chinese still use this set of Latin alphabets to communicate with relatives overseas. Starting from Lu Zhuangzhang's "Qieyin Xinzi" in 1892, many patriotic people in our country at that time also actively advocated language reform and created various phonetic alphabet schemes. In 1926, the "National Romanization" formulated by Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, Zhao Yuanren, etc. was produced, and was officially announced by the then Nanjing University in 1928. Then, in 1931, the "Latinized New Writing" formulated by Qu Qiubai, Wu Yuzhang, etc. was produced. Latinized New Writing and National Romanization are two relatively complete Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes in Latin alphabets created by the Chinese themselves. When talking about the current phonetic alphabet scheme, we cannot but recognize their contribution.
	The now-announced draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is developed on the basis of the past direct pronunciation, fanqie, and various phonetic alphabet schemes. From the adoption of Latin alphabets, its historical origin can be traced back to more than 350 years ago, and more recently, it can be said to be a summary of the experience of the Chinese people in creating Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes for 60 years. This scheme is indeed more complete than the various Latin alphabet phonetic alphabet schemes that have existed in history and are still in use. Since the Chinese Language Reform Committee published the first draft in February 1956, it has been widely discussed by people from all walks of life organized by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It has also been repeatedly reviewed and revised by the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee established by the State Council. In October last year, it was discussed by the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and on November 1, it was passed by the 60th meeting of the State Council, and it was decided to publish it in the newspaper and prepare to submit it to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. It is not difficult for people to see from this that the government has taken a responsible and cautious attitude towards this issue. It is by no means as the right-wing element Zhang Bojun said, "a few people shut themselves up and worked on it," "only after the discussion of a few enthusiastic people."
	Does the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme's adoption of Latin alphabets conflict with the patriotic feelings of the Chinese people? Why can't we create our own set of alphabets or continue to use phonetic symbols? Since 1952, the Chinese Language Reform Committee has spent nearly three years working on creating its own alphabets (including revising phonetic symbols), but it has not been able to obtain satisfactory results, and finally decided to give up and adopt Latin alphabets. There are now more than 60 countries in the world that use Latin alphabets as symbols for writing languages. For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Albania, Hungary, Polond, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Vietnam, Indonesia, and three allied republics of the Soviet Union – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all use Latin alphabets. After accepting the Latin alphabets, they all made necessary adjustments or processing to adapt them to the needs of their own languages, so they have all become their own alphabets of each ethnic group. On the other hand, Latin alphabets can indeed be said to be not the exclusive alphabets of any country, but international common symbols. We cannot say that the French use English alphabets, just as we cannot say that the British use French alphabets. We can only say: the French use French alphabets, and the British use English alphabets. Similarly, after we adopt Latin alphabets and make adjustments to make them adapt to the needs of Chinese, they have become our own Chinese phonetic alphabets, no longer the alphabets of ancient Latin, and even less the alphabets of any foreign country. Alphabets are tools for spelling phonetics, and we use them to serve us, just as we use trains, ships, cars, and airplanes (from the source, these things are also foreign) to serve us, just as we use Arabic numerals to calculate, use the Gregorian calendar to record years, use kilometers to express distances, and use kilograms to express weight. Therefore, this will not cause any damage to our patriotic feelings.
	In addition to this, there is another issue that everyone is concerned about, that is, what is the future of Chinese characters? Chinese characters have made indelible achievements in history. On this point, we all agree. As for the future of Chinese characters, will they be immortal and remain unchanged forever? Or will they change? Will it change towards its own form? Or will it be replaced by a phonetic writing system? Will it be replaced by a Latin alphabet phonetic writing system? Or will it be replaced by another form of phonetic writing system? We are not in a hurry to draw conclusions on this issue now. But writing systems are always going to change. The past changes in Chinese characters can prove it. It will always change in the future. And it can be said that the writing forms of various ethnic groups in the world will gradually become unified one day, and even languages will gradually become unified in the end. The ultimate trend of the development of human language and writing is to gradually approach, and in the end, there may not be much difference. This kind of ideal is not bad, but good. As for what scheme to use, we are not in a hurry to affirm it now. Regarding the future of Chinese characters, everyone has different opinions and can argue about them. I don't intend to talk too much about it here, because this is not within the scope of the current language reform tasks.
	The above is said to be the three tasks of the current language reform work promoted by the government. We hope that the current language reform work can get everyone's support. Language reform is a major event related to the people of the whole country. The steps taken by the government on it are very cautious. We are willing to listen to the opinions of all parties as much as possible, so as to gather ideas and work hard together to do this work well. If there are shortcomings in the work, we will correct them—this is the policy of our Party and government in carrying out all work, and it is the same for the language reform work. Regarding language reform, the past publicity work has been done very poorly, so many people still don't understand it, and there are even many misunderstandings. I hope everyone will do publicity to eliminate this misunderstanding. I hope everyone will actively support the language reform work, promote this work instead of "demoting" this work, so that Chinese writing can be reformed steadily and actively to meet the needs of 600 million people to get rid of cultural backwardness and to meet the needs of developing socialist undertakings with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    第一是简化汉字。“汉字简化方案”是1956年1月由国务院公布的。这个方案包含三个部分：第一部分即汉字简化第一表，包含230个简字，从方案公布的时候起即已通用。第二部分即汉字简化第二表，包含285个简字，其中的95个简字已从1956年6月起开始试用。第三部分即汉字偏旁简化表，包含54个简化偏旁，已有30个根据这个表类推出来的简字从方案公布的时候起开始试用。以上三项合计，现在报刊上使用的简字一共有355个。方案公布后，两年来，简字已经在报纸、刊物、课本和一般书籍上普遍采用，受到广大群众的欢迎，大家称便，特别是对初学文字的儿童和成人的确做了一件很大的好事。河南一位老师向小学生介绍简字，说“豐收”的“豐”字今后可以简写成三横一竖的“丰”字，孩子们高兴得鼓掌欢呼。天津一个工人说，“盡、邊、辦”这三字学了半年了，总记不住，这会简化成“尽、边、办”，一下就记住了。李凤莲同志有个弟弟，在家乡种地，写信给李凤莲同志诉苦，说农民普遍感到汉字难学。农民常用的一些字，像“農民”的“農”，“穀子”的“瑴”，“麵粉”的“麵”，“麥子”的“麥”，还有“雜糧”这两个字，这一类字都不好写。李凤莲同志给他弟弟寄了一本简化汉字的书去，他弟弟高兴极了，回信说“这些新字好学得多”，还埋怨他姐姐为什么不早些给他寄去。简体字是要比繁体字好学好写，因此包括工人、农民、小学生和教师在内的广大群众热烈欢迎简字，这是很自然的事。
    至于像我们这样的知识分子，跟汉字已经打了几十年的交道，当初写了别字给老师责备甚至打手心的事在记忆中已经渐渐淡薄，因此觉得繁体简体都无所谓，对于简字不热心，甚至还觉得不顺眼，思想上有抵触。在这一点上，我很赞成李烛尘先生的看法。李先生给“文字改革月刊”写了一篇文章。他说：“一提到汉字改革，总有些人提出这样那样的理由，不同意甚至坚决反对。如有人说，‘汉字并不难’。我看这样的人和‘好了疮巴忘了痛’的人一样，忘记了当年初学‘三字经’、‘千字文’时的痛苦了。我想这些人如果能回想一下当年自己学习汉字的痛苦，再设身处地为儿童和文盲的利益着想，也许不至于不同意或者坚决反对。”李烛老又在他的文章中批评了那些反对汉字简化的人。他说：汉字简化方案公布后，有人说什么“快变成文盲了”。他认为这种感叹和顾虑是多余的。简字中有很多字是人们早就熟悉的。这怎末会“变成文盲”？当然，有些字比较生疏，但是也只要稍微动动脑筋，问题也就解决了，决不至“变成文盲”。为了广大的劳动人民和千千万万的儿童，知识分子应该动动脑筋。因此，李烛老不仅赞成把燭字简化成“烛”，而且赞成把塵字简化为“尘”。我看问题确实是这样。汉字简化既然符合广大人民的利益，我们知识分子就应该积极支持这个工作，而不是消极对待。我们应该从六亿人口出发来考虑文字改革的问题，而不是从个人的习惯和一时的方便来看这个问题。
    在整风运动初期，一些右派分子对文字改革进行了恶毒的攻击，说汉字简化搞糟了，群众都反对，要国务院收回成命，把“汉字简化方案”撤回。右派分子的攻击文字改革，自然是别有用心，他们是要借此向党和政府进攻，但是另外他们确实也是反对文字改革。汉字简化是符合广大人民利益的好事，反人民的右派分子自然要反对。我们站在广大人民的立场上，首先应该把汉字简化这项工作肯定下来。汉字简化是符合群众利益并且受到群众热烈欢迎的好事，两年来的试用也证明是有成效的，应该给以坚决支持。
    那末是不是说汉字简化工作就没有缺点呢？是不是说“汉字简化方案”中的简字就没有不合适的呢？不是的。应该指出：汉字简化工作所采取的方针“约定俗成，稳步前进”是正确的，已为两年来的经验所证明，但是在具体工作中还有考虑得不周到的地方。实践证明，少数简字在应用上还不够妥善，或者可能发生误解。这些少数简化得不恰当、在使用中证明有缺点的简字，应该另行规定它们的简体，或者保留原来的繁体。1956年1月国务院公布的“汉字简化方案”中，除了汉字简化第一表中的230个简字作为公布推行以外，第二表中的285个简字和第三表中的54个简化偏旁尚在征求意见，本来还没有定案。就是第一表中的230个简字，如果的确有不适当的，也可以作必要的修改。中国文字改革委员会现在正在征求各方意见，进行简字的整理和修订工作，大家对简字有什么意见，可以向中国文字改革委员会提出，请他们考虑，然后再进一步定案。
    目前社会上使用简字，还存在一些混乱现象。有些人任意自造简字，除了他自己认识以外，几乎没有别人认识，这种现象自然不好。这种滥造简字的现象，应该加以适当的控制。一个人记笔记，或者写私信，他写的是什么样的字，谁也无法管。但是写布告或者通知，是叫大家看的，就应该遵守统一的规范。特别在印刷物和打字的文件上，必须防止滥用简字。希望新闻出版方面和文书工作方面加以注意。使用简字方面存在一些混乱，人们往往以此指责中国文字改革委员会。不错，我们可以批评文字改革委员会，说它对简化汉字的宣传工作做得不够，对滥用简字的现象控制得不好。但是在另外一方面，我们也应该承认，这种新造简字的现象，是历来就存在的，现在大家公认了的简字，最初也是少数人新造的，今后这个过程也无法完全停止。
    我们从汉字的历史上来看，一字多体是从甲骨文起就一直存在的。要说是混乱，那末这种混乱是“古已有之”，顶多不过“于今为烈”罢了。这个“于今为烈”的主要原因，在于今天广大群众正在开始掌握文字并且迫切要求改革文字，这是历史上任何一个朝代所没有的。汉字字形演变的总的趋势是简化。由于汉字难写，人民群众不断创造了许多简字。尽管历代的统治者不承认，说它们是“别字”“俗字”，简字还是在民间流行，并且受到群众的欢迎。因此，我们应该说，远在文字改革委员会成立之前，人民群众早已在改革文字，而文字改革委员会的工作，无非是搜集、整理群众的创造，并且经过各方的讨论加以推广罢了。同时，我们也采用了某些日本简化了的汉字。可见使用简字方面存在的一些混乱并不是汉字简化工作引起的，而“汉字简化方案”的制定，目的正在于把这个混乱引导到一个统一的规范。只有在汉字简化工作方面采取积极的措施，才能逐渐转变这种混乱现象。
    此外，还有一个问题，就是汉字简化会不会妨碍我国书法的流传和爱好呢？我想是不会的。书法是一种艺术，当然可以不受汉字简化的限制。简字本来主要是用在印刷上的，我们不可能强制大家必须按照“汉字简化方案”写字。因此汉字简化不会对我国的书法艺术有什么不利的影响。同时我们也应当欢迎书法家按照简化汉字书写，以提高简字的艺术水平。
              （二）
    第二是推广普通话。我国汉民族的语言还存在着很严重的方言分歧。其中大量的是语音方面的问题。不同地区的人，如果各说各的方言，往往不容易互相了解。甚至在同一个省里，例如闽南人跟闽北人，苏南人跟苏北人，交谈就发生困难。这种方言的分歧，对于我国人民的政治、经济、文化生活都带来了不利的影响。北方的干部有时要调到南方去，南方的大学生有时要分配到北方来，沿海城市的工人要去支援内地的工业建设——如果没有一种共同的语言，我们的建设工作就会遭到一定的困难。常常有这样的事情：一个重要的报告，一门重要的课程，由于方言的作梗，大大妨碍了听讲的人的理解。广播和电影是我们的重要的宣传工具，但是由于普通话还没有普及，它们的功效在方言地区不能不受到一定的限制。解放以来，我国实现了历史上空前的统一，全国人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗，人们就越来越感觉到使用一种共同语言的迫切需要。因此，在我国汉族人民中努力推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话就是一项重要的政治任务。
    自从1955年10月全国文字改革会议以来，推广普通话的工作已经收到了一些成效。到1957年年底为止全国中小学和师范学校语文教师中已经有七十二万一千人受过普通话的语音训练。全国中小学校中，有很大一部分已经开始用普通话进行教学。全国收听中央广播电台举办的普通话语音教学广播讲座的在二百万人以上。据教育部张奚若部长说，他去西安视察，发现西安的一些小学生能说一口很好的普通话。这就说明了：只要大家重视这个工作，认真地加以推广，就能够收到成效。我们希望各地教育部门，能在较短期间把中小学语文教师全部训练完毕，好使全国所有的中小学校普遍开始教学普通话。
    推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，并非要求全体汉族人民都能说得像北京人一样，这样既不可能，也是不必要的。北京语音是个标准，有个标准就有了个方向，大家好向它看齐。但是在具体推广和教学工作中，对不同对象应有不同的要求。比方对广播员、电影和话剧演员、师范学校的语文教师就应该要求严些，对一般人就可以要求宽些，对中年以上的人就可以不必有此一般要求。这样，才能减少推广普通话的阻力，提高大家对学习普通话的信心和兴趣。在什么地方推广普通话？我看首先应该在学校里、在儿童和青年中努力推广。
    我们推广普通话，是为的消除方言之间的隔阂，而不是禁止和消灭方言。推广普通话是不是要禁止或者消灭方言？自然不是的。方言是会长期存在的。方言不能用行政命令来禁止，也不能用人为的办法来消灭。推广普通话，要区别老年和青年，要区别全国性活动和地方性活动，要区别今天和明天，不能一概而论。相反地，只会说普通话的人，也要学点各地方言，才能深入各个方言区的劳动群众。
    要把六亿汉族人民的方言逐渐统一起来，这是一项艰巨的任务，必须作长期不懈的努力，才能实现。究竟要多长？就要看交通、经济和文化的发展和我们的工作，但是只要我们不断地认真地工作，这个任务是一定可以实现的。我们应该有这样的信心。我希望大家多做一些宣传工作，造成有利于推广普通话的社会风气。我们还应该随时举办一些普通话演说竞赛，对于普通话说得好的学生、教得好的教师给以奖励。总之，要多用一些办法来宣传鼓励，来改变社会风气，使它有利于普通话的推广工作。
              （三）
    第三是制定和推广汉语拼音方案。首先，应该说清楚，汉语拼音方案是用来为汉字注音和推广普通话的，它并不是用来代替汉字的拼音文字。汉语拼音方案的第一个用处，就是给汉字注音。汉字难不难学呢？究竟要不要用拼音字母来帮助学习呢？关于这个问题还有些不同的意见。有人说，“拼音文字并不容易，外国文也有难学的。”这个问题，本民族只能跟本民族比。我们有了拼音字母给汉字注音，自然比没有拼音字母注音容易。至于外国文：我们学了几十年汉字，再学外国文，自然觉得外国文比汉字难。学别一个民族的文字，总比学本民族的文字要难。俄文比较难学，但是俄国人觉得俄文比英文、德文还容易。拼音文字难易问题，跟本国人学外国文的难易问题是两个不同的问题，不能混为一谈。我看应该承认：汉字是难读难写的，因而也就难记。不要说初学汉字的儿童，就是学了多年的成人，对于不少的汉字也还是不认识，或者要读错。现在我们一方面简化汉字的笔画，另一方面给它注上拼音，目的在乎减少汉字的读和写的困难，让它容易为广大群众掌握。利用拼音可以提高汉字的教学效率，这一点已经为过去的速成识字法以及现在小学的先教注音字母的经验所证明。希望拼音方案经过全国人民代表大会批准之后，小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本上就能用来给汉字注音，小学识字教育和文盲扫除工作将得到极大的便利，这是可以断言的。
    其次，汉语拼音方案还可以用来拼写普通话，作为教学普通话的有效工具。学习普通话光靠耳朵和嘴巴是不够的，学了容易忘记，必须有一套标音符号，用来编印拼音的读物和注音的字典，供学的人随时查考，不断校正自己的发音，收效才大。过去我们没有一种普遍流行的较为满意的拼音工具，这对于推广普通话的工作是个很大的阻碍。现在因为拼音方案尚未定案，还在使用注音字母。可是注音字母虽然已有四十来年的历史，过去的政府也曾经在小学推行过，但是大多数人学过之后就丢了，至今懂得的人很少。今后我们采用拉丁字母的汉语拼音字母，这套字母是科学、技术等方面广泛使用的，大家使用和接触的机会很多，学过之后就不容易忘记。因此，采用这套字母，对于推广普通话的工作会有很大的好处。
    第三，汉语拼音方案可以作为各少数民族创造和改革文字的共同基础。我国共有近五十个民族，其中有许多民族还没有自己的文字，另外一些民族虽然有文字，但是也需要改进。已有文字的民族中，除汉族用汉字以外，有用藏文字母的，有用蒙文字母的，有用阿拉伯字母的，有用朝鲜谚文的，还有用其他各种字母的。这些兄弟民族创造和改革文字的时候，应该采用什么字母作为基础呢？能不能就用汉字作为各民族文字的共同基础呢？过去曾经有人这样试过，没有成功，证明这条路是走不通的。如果几十个民族大家各搞一套字母，这不仅对于各族人民之间的互相学习和交流经验是个障碍，而且印刷、打字、电报的设备势必各搞一套，对于各民族今后在文化教育方面的发展极其不利。许多兄弟民族都表示这样的愿望，就是要同汉族在字母上取得一致，以便于交流文化，学习汉语，和吸收汉语的名词术语。前几年，汉语采用什么字母还有些举棋不定，使一些兄弟民族创造和改革文字的工作也受了影响。现在西南区已经有十几个民族创造了拉丁字母的民族文字，但是他们还是不大放心，因为我们的方案还没有最后定案。因此，汉语拼音方案再不能拖延下去了，否则还要耽误人家的事情。汉语现在既然决定采用拉丁字母作为拼音字母，应该确定这样一条原则：今后各民族创造或者改革文字的时候，原则上应该以拉丁字母为基础，并且应该在字母的读音和用法上尽量跟汉语拼音方案取得一致。可以预料，汉语拼音方案的制定，对于各兄弟民族的创造和改革文字，以及今后各族人民之间的互相学习和沟通，将有极大的利益。
    第四，汉语拼音方案可以帮助外国人学习汉语，以促进国际文化交流。由于我国在国际事务中的地位日益提高，在许多国家中，首先是在社会主义兄弟国家和亚非友好国家中，愿意学习汉语的人是越来越多了。他们遭到的最大困难就是汉字，因此常有望洋兴叹之感。现在我们有了汉语拼音方案，就可以用这套字母来编印供各国人民学习汉语的课本、词典和读物，来帮助他们解除这个困难。北京大学的外国留学生专修班采用了汉语拼音方案的第一个草案进行教学，很有成效，说明汉语拼音方案在这方面有很大的优越性，汉字和注音字母是远不能跟它相比的。外国朋友学会了汉语之后，可以仍然依靠这套拼音字母作为注音工具，再进而学习汉字汉文，也一定可以比没有拼音字母容易得多。这是汉语拼音方案在促进国际文化交流方面的功用。
    此外，汉语拼音方案还有其他方面的各种用处，例如可以用来音译外国的人名地名和科学技术术语，可以在对外的文件、书报中音译中国的人名地名，可以用来编索引，等等。
    从汉语拼音方案的上述各项功用看来，我们说汉语拼音方案的制订是中国人民文化生活中的一件大事，是不算夸大的。
    中国文字从甲骨文算起，到现在已经有三千四、五百年的历史，三千多年来，汉字曾经经历过许多变迁：字形简化了，新字增加了，一部分旧字被淘汰了。初期的汉字是象形字，之后产生了许多形声字，或称谐声字——我们现在使用的字，大多是形声字。但是由于古今语音的演变，许多形声字的声符已经失去了标音的作用，例如“江”“河”，已经不念“工”“可”。因此，正如鲁迅所说，汉字变成了“不象形的象形字，不谐声的谐声字”。既然字面上不容易看出它的音，就不得不另行设法补救。一种办法是“直音”，就是用甲字来注乙字的音，也就是用同音字互相注音。这个办法常常会碰到困难：有时候一个字就没有跟它同音的字，或者虽然有同音的字，这个字恰巧是个冷僻字，注了等于不注。另外一个办法是“反切”，就是用两个字来拼切一个音：上字取声，下字取韵。反切的发明可以说是拼音的萌芽。但是由于我国各地语音出入甚大，常常两个字在甲地读音相同，在乙地就有不同的读音，这种情况就更增加了直音和反切发生分歧差误的机会。尤其是无论是直音或者反切，都须先认识不少字，因此对于初学文字的儿童和成人都是很难掌握的。辛亥革命之后，产生了注音字母，这是中国第一套由国家正式公布并且在中小学校普遍推行过的拼音字母。注音字母对于识字教育和读音统一有过一定的贡献。尽管今天看来，注音字母还有不少缺点（例如，作为各少数民族文字的共同基础和促进国际文化交流的工具，注音字母显然远不如拉丁字母），但是注音字母在历史上的功绩，我们应该加以肯定。对于近四十年来的拼音字母运动，注音字母也起了开创的作用。现在这个汉语拼音方案，它的主要功用之一是为汉字注音，在这个意义上，汉语拼音方案正是继承了直音、反切和注音字母的传统，在它们的基础上发展起来的。
    汉语拼音方案历史发展的另外一个方面，即：采用拉丁字母为汉字注音，已经经历了三百五十多年的历史。1605年，来中国的意大利传教士利玛窦最初用拉丁字母来给汉字注音。1625年，另外一个法国传教士金尼阁又用拉丁字母给汉字注音的办法著了一部“西儒耳目资”。他们的目的是为适应外国人学习汉语汉文的需要。鸦片战争以后，帝国主义国家派来中国的商人和传教士愈来愈多。他们为了学习汉语和传播宗教的需要，拟订了许多不同的汉语拼音方案，其中影响最大的有所谓邮政式和威妥玛式。他们还用拉丁字母拟订了我国各地方言的拼音方案，其中如闽南的白话字（即厦门话的拉丁字母拼音方案）影响最大，曾经出版过许多书籍。据说至今厦门一带还有很多人懂得这个方案，许多侨眷还用这套拉丁字母跟海外的亲属通信。从1892年卢戆章的“切音新字”开始，当时我国的许多爱国人士也都积极提倡文字改革，并且创制各种拼音方案。1926年产生了由钱玄同、黎锦熙、赵元任等制订的“国语罗马字”，至1928年由当时南京的大学院正式公布。接着，1931年产生了由瞿秋白、吴玉章等制订的“拉丁化新文字”。拉丁化新文字和国语罗马字是中国人自己创制的拉丁字母式的汉语拼音方案中比较完善的两个方案。在谈到现在的拼音方案的时候，不能不承认他们的功劳。
    现在公布的汉语拼音方案草案，是在过去的直音、反切以及各种拼音方案的基础上发展出来的。从采用拉丁字母来说，它的历史渊源远则可以一直推溯到三百五十多年以前，近则可以说是总结了六十年来我国人民创制汉语拼音方案的经验。这个方案，比起历史上存在过的以及目前还在沿用的各种拉丁字母的拼音方案来，确实更加完善。自从1956年2月由中国文字改革委员会发表了第一个草案以后，曾经经过全国政协和各地政协委员会所组织的各方面人士的广泛讨论，又经国务院成立的汉语拼音方案审订委员会反复审议和多次修订，去年10月间复经全国政协常委会扩大会讨论，才于11月1日由国务院全体会议第六十次会议通过，并决定登报公布，准备提请全国人民代表大会下次会议讨论和批准。人们从这里不难看出，政府对于这个问题是采取了负责的和慎重的态度的，决不是如右派分子章伯钧所说，是少数人关起门来搞的，“只经过少数热心分子的讨论”。
    汉语拼音方案采用了拉丁字母，这是不是会跟我国人民的爱国感情相抵触呢？为什么我们不能自创一套字母或者就沿用注音字母呢？从1952年起，中国文字改革委员会曾经用了近三年的功夫从事于自创字母（包括修订注音字母）的工作，没有能够得到满意的结果，最后才决定放弃，采用拉丁字母。现在世界上有六十多个国家采用拉丁字母来作为书写语言的符号。例如英国、法国、德国、意大利、西班牙、荷兰、丹麦、瑞典、挪威、阿尔巴尼亚、匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、越南、印度尼西亚以及苏联的三个加盟共和国——爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛，都是用的拉丁字母。它们接受了拉丁字母之后，都对它作了必要的调整或者加工，使它适应本民族语言的需要，因此都已经成为各个民族自己的字母了。另一方面，拉丁字母也因此确实可以说不是哪一个国家专有的字母，而是国际公用的符号。我们不能说法国人用的是英文字母，正像不能说英国人用的是法文字母一样。我们只能说：法国人用的是法文字母，英国人用的是英文字母。同样，我们采用了拉丁字母，经过我们的调整使它适应了汉语的需要之后，它已经成为我们自己的汉语拼音字母，已不再是古拉丁文的字母，更不是任何一个外国的字母了。字母是拼写语音的工具，我们用它来为我们服务，正像我们采用火车、轮船、汽车、飞机（从来源来说，这些东西也都是外来的）来为我们服务一样，正如我们采用阿拉伯数字来计算，采用公历来纪年，采用公里来表示距离，采用公斤来表示重量一样。因此，这是不会使我们的爱国感情受到任何损害的。
    除此以外，还有一个问题是大家都关心的，就是汉字的前途究属如何的问题。汉字在历史上有过不可磨灭的功绩，在这一点上我们大家的意见都是一致的。至于汉字的前途，它是不是千秋万岁永远不变呢？还是要变呢？它是向着汉字自己的形体变化呢？还是被拼音文字代替呢？它是为拉丁字母式的拼音文字所代替，还是为另一种形式的拼音文字所代替呢？这个问题我们现在还不忙作出结论。但是文字总是要变化的，拿汉字过去的变化就可以证明。将来总要变化的。而且可以说，世界各个民族的文字形式将来总有一天会逐渐统一，甚至语言最后也会逐渐统一。人类的语言文字发展的最后趋势是逐渐接近，到最后也许就没有多大区别了。这种理想不是坏的，而是好的。至于用什么方案，现在不忙把它肯定。关于汉字的前途问题，大家有不同的意见，可以争鸣，我在这里不打算多谈，因为这不属于当前文字改革任务的范围。
      以上所说是政府所推行的当前文字改革工作的三项任务。我们希望，当前文字改革的工作能够得到大家的支持。文字改革是关系到全国人民的一件大事，政府对它采取的步骤是很慎重的。我们愿意尽量听取各方面的意见，好集思广益，大家一起来努力做好这项工作。工作中如果有缺点，我们就改正——这是我们党和政府进行各项工作的方针，对于文字改革工作也是这样。关于文字改革，过去的宣传工作做得很差，因此有许多人还不了解，甚至有不少误解。希望大家来做宣传，消除这种误解。希望大家积极支持文字改革工作，促进这一工作而不要“促退”这一工作，好使中国文字能够稳步地而又积极地得到改革，以适应六亿人民摆脱文化落后状态的需要，以适应多、快、好、省地发展社会主义事业的需要。
