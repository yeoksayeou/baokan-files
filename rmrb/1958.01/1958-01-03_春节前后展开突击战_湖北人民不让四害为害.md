　　This newspaper's Hankou, 2nd Dispatch: The broad masses of Hubei Province, with revolutionary spirit, are fighting against the four pests, and have achieved great results. In Wuhan City, thirteen grain stores, five hundred and sixteen civilian boats, and dozens of residential committees are basically free of rats. Chu Jia Wan in Xiaogan is basically free of flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, and fleas, and has very few rats and sparrows. The masses also have new hygiene habits. The traditional saying that "soy sauce is not made without maggots" has now also gone bankrupt, because some soy sauce gardens here are now maggot-free. In 1957, Huanggang County appeared as the first "Four-Free Wan" in the province -- Xinwu Wan. Beizha Township in Gong'an County, with 1,791 households, has also basically eliminated flies and mosquitoes, and in another two or three years, it will be able to basically eliminate rats and sparrows. From the winter of 1956 to the present, they have eliminated more than 100,000 rats and more than 60,000 sparrows, destroyed more than 3,000 sparrow nests, found more than 5,000 sparrow eggs, and dug up more than 3,250 catties of fly pupae. In 1957, in conjunction with the elimination of the four pests, the township accumulated 320,000 dan of fertilizer. In previous years, three out of ten people suffered from malaria, but in 1957, only one and a half out of a thousand people suffered from malaria. In previous years, six and a half out of ten people had diarrhea, but in 1957, only five out of a thousand people had diarrhea. In Hongguang Cooperative in this township, with a total of 527 people, not a single person fell ill in 1957, and infectious diseases such as typhoid fever also disappeared.
    In order to seize the opportunity of eliminating the four pests in winter and spring, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all localities to carry out shock month and shock week campaigns to eliminate the four pests before and after the Spring Festival. At present, this movement is vigorously developing. Jiangling, Zhongxiang, and other counties have convened county-wide conferences of youth activists in eliminating the four pests to summarize achievements, commend advanced individuals, exchange experiences, and formulate plans for eliminating the four pests. Zhongxiang County has already organized an 110,000-strong youth army to eliminate the four pests and put them into the activities of eliminating the four pests. The four pests elimination movement in various places is also closely combined with central tasks such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. They labor and produce during the day, eliminate the four pests at night, and widely carry out propaganda and mobilization. Zhushi Township in Honghu County, in conjunction with water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, launched a week-long campaign to eliminate the four pests. In one month, they eliminated 4,000 rats and 850 sparrows. Youths in Xiaofan Township in Xiangyang captured more than 17,400 rats and sparrows in the early morning, at night, and during rest periods.

    春节前后展开突击战
    湖北人民不让四害为害
    本报汉口2日电　湖北省广大群众以革命的精神，和四害进行斗争，获得了巨大的成绩。武汉市已有十三个粮店，五百一十六只民船和数十个居民委员会基本无鼠。孝感楚家壪已经基本上没有苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、跳蚤，很少有老鼠和麻雀。群众也有了新的卫生习惯。“无蛆不成酱”这个传统的说法，现在也破产了，因为这里已有
  一些酱园无蛆了。黄冈县在1957年更出现了全省第一个四无壪——新屋壪。公安县北闸乡有一千七百九十一户，也基本上消灭了苍蝇、蚊子，再有两、三年就可以基本上消灭老鼠、麻雀。从1956年冬天到现在，那里消灭了十万多只老鼠、六万多只麻雀，捣毁三千多个雀窝，摸了五千多个雀蛋，挖了三千二百五十多斤蝇蛹。1957年，结合除四害，该乡积肥三十二万担。往年十人中要有三人害疟疾，而1957年在一千个人中只有一个半人害疟疾。往年十个人中有六个半人泻肚子，1957年也是一千个人中只有五人泻肚子。这个乡的红光社共有五百二十七人，1957年没有一个害病，伤寒等传染病也绝迹了。
    为了抓住冬春除四害的时机，中共湖北省委指示各地在春节前后开展除四害突击月和突击周运动。目前，这一运动正在蓬勃开展。江陵、锺祥等县召开了全县青少年除四害积极分子大会，总结成绩，表扬先进，交流经验，订出除四害规划。锺祥县已经组织了一个十一万青少年除四害大军，投入除四害的活动。各地除四害运动还紧密结合兴修水利和积肥等中心工作进行。他们白天劳动生产，晚上除四害，并且广泛地进行宣传动员。洪湖县朱市乡结合兴修水利和积肥，开展除四害运动周，在一个月中，消灭老鼠四千只，麻雀八百五十只，襄阳小樊乡青少年在清晨、夜晚和休息时间，共扑捉老鼠、麻雀一万七千四百多只。
