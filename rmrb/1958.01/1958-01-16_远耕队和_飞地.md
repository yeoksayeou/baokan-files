    Distant Farming Teams and "Enclaves"
    Editor
    Some agricultural cooperatives organize their surplus labor into distant farming teams to reclaim some wasteland in other townships and counties to increase income. Farmers call this land "enclaves." This method of organizing distant farming teams is worth promoting. The practice of Cha Ling County in Hunan, introduced on the first page of today's newspaper, is a very good example.
    China's existing cultivated land area is 1.6 billion mu, and the uncultivated wasteland is close to this number. It can be seen that land reclamation is a promising undertaking. However, the establishment of farms by the state or the organization of large-scale long-distance migration to reclaim wasteland with machinery is currently limited by the state's financial and material resources. Organizing agricultural cooperatives to engage in small-scale, short-distance land reclamation and to create "enclaves" is a practical and feasible method at present. This kind of small-scale land reclamation mainly relies on the financial and material resources of the masses themselves, does not require state investment, and is relatively easy to do; at the same time, it can also make full use of the surplus labor of some agricultural cooperatives to increase production and increase the income of members.
    Some people think that wasteland is all in the Northeast, Northwest, and other border areas, and that the interior is densely populated with no wasteland to reclaim. This is not the case. It is true that there are large areas of wasteland in the border areas, but the provinces and counties in the interior are not lacking in small pieces of barren or semi-cultivated wasteland waiting to be reclaimed. Zhejiang's population is considered dense, but the five special zones of Ningbo and others have nearly three million mu of wasteland. Chao'an County in Guangdong, which has the densest population, originally had an average of only one mu of cultivated land per person, but the county has also discovered more than 13,000 mu of wasteland. It is estimated that, including hills, beaches, sandy wasteland, alkaline land, as well as scattered wasteland along ditches, roadsides, in front of houses, and behind houses, there are about 100 million mu of small pieces of wasteland across the country.
    Some people also think that small pieces of scattered wasteland are not very profitable and are not worth reclaiming. This is also wrong. In the spring of 1956, Zhongning County in Gansu Province organized the surplus labor of 19 townships to go out for land reclamation. Before the spring plowing, they had reclaimed more than 80,000 mu of wasteland, increasing the county's cultivated land area by one-third. At that time, the Zhongzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Chengmai County, Guangdong, had only 1,300 mu of land for more than 900 people in the whole cooperative, which was not enough to plant, and the grain harvested was not enough to eat. Later, they reclaimed more than 1,000 mu of wasteland in the Beicha area more than 30 miles away, increasing their grain income by more than 100,000 jin, solving the food shortage problem for most farmers. Those who despise small pieces of wasteland should learn a lesson from these examples. If the approximately 100 million mu of small pieces of wasteland across the country are all reclaimed, even if each mu yields 200 jin, it can increase grain production by 20 billion jin. Isn't this a very considerable amount?
    Some people also believe that the main aspect of increasing agricultural production in our country is to increase the yield per unit area, so they are not actively reclaiming the wasteland that can be reclaimed. This is also wrong. It is certainly very important to increase the yield per unit area, but the wasteland that can be reclaimed should still be reclaimed as much as possible, because this is completely beneficial and harmless.
    Short-distance land reclamation is an undertaking that benefits both the country and the people, and is in line with the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and building the country diligently and thriftily. Article 16 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) clearly stipulates: "In places where conditions permit, immigrants should be organized and cooperatives should be encouraged to organize branch offices or send out production teams to carry out land reclamation." Comrades who lead rural work in various places should consider the conditions in their own regions and strive to reclaim all the small pieces of wasteland that can be reclaimed.

    远耕队和“飞地”
    编者
    有些农业合作社把本社的剩余劳动力组织成远耕队，到外乡外县去开垦一些荒地，增加收入。农民把这种地叫做“飞地”。这种组织远耕队的办法很值得提倡。今天本报一版介绍的湖南茶陵县的作法，就是一个很好的例子。
    我国现有耕地面积是十六亿亩，而未开垦的荒地也接近这个数字，可见开荒是一项大有可为的事情。但是，由国家建立农场或者组织大规模的远距离移民，用机器垦荒，目前还受着国家财力物力的限制。组织农业合作社搞近距离的小型开荒，搞“飞地”，则是目前切实可行的办法。这种小型开荒主要依靠群众自己的财力物力，不需要国家投资，做起来也比较容易；同时也可以充分利用一部分农业社的剩余劳力来增加生产和增加社员收入。
    有些人认为荒地都在东北、西北和其他边疆地带，内地人口稠密，无荒可开，事实并不如此。边疆有大片荒地是事实，但内地各省各县也并不缺乏尚待开垦的小片生熟荒地。浙江人口算是密了，而宁波等五个专区就有荒地近三百万亩。广东人口最密的潮安县，原来每人平均只有一亩带零的耕地，而县境内却也曾发现过荒地一万三千多亩。据估计，包括丘陵、滩地、沙荒、碱地以及沟边、路旁、家前、屋后等零星荒地在内，全国约有小片荒地一亿亩左右。
    也有人认为小片零星荒地没有多大油水，不值得开垦。这也是不对的。甘肃省中宁县1956年春季曾经组织十九个乡的剩余劳力外出开荒，春耕前共开荒八万多亩，使全县耕地面积增加三分之一。广东澄迈县钟寨农业社，当时全社九百多口人只有一千三百多亩田，不够种，收的粮食也不够吃。后来他们在三十多里以外的北插地区开了一千多亩荒，增加了十万多斤粮食的收入，大部分农户的缺粮问题解决了。轻视小片荒地的人们，应当从这些事例中得到教训。全国一亿亩左右的小片荒地如果都开垦出来，就按一亩收二百斤计算，也能增产粮食二百亿斤，这还不是一个非常可观的数目么？
    也有人认为我国农业增产的主要方面是提高单位面积产量，因此就对能开的荒地也不积极去开，这也是错误的。提高单位面积产量固然非常重要，但能够开的荒地也还是应该尽量去开，因为这是完全有利无害的。
    近距离开荒是一项既利国又利民，符合于勤俭办社、勤俭建国原则的事业。全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第十六条里明确规定：“在有条件的地方，应当组织移民和鼓励合作社组织分社或者派出生产队，进行垦荒。”各地领导农村工作的同志，都应该考虑一下自己地区的条件，争取把能够开垦的小片荒地都开出来。
