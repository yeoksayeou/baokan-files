    Shenyang Textile Machinery Factory Runs Enterprise Diligently and Thriftily
    Old Equipment Produces Precision Machines
    (Our Newspaper News) The state-owned Shenyang Textile Machinery Factory has only been formally producing textile machines for a little over two years. During this period, it has only added five new pieces of equipment, yet it has manufactured more than ten new products for the country. Among them is a drawing frame that supplies modern textile factories, which has been exported in large quantities to foreign countries. It has a streamlined, piano-like beautiful appearance, single motor drive, and electrical automatic parking and indicator lights. The automatic weft winding machine being trial-produced by this factory has a rotation speed of up to 9,000 revolutions per minute. Engineering and technical personnel are studying how to improve its performance to the international advanced level of 12,000 revolutions per minute.
    This factory was originally a factory that repaired and fitted textile machinery. Why can it quickly manufacture many precision machines? The director of this factory said that this is mainly due to the implementation of the Central Government's spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, giving full play to equipment capabilities, and improving workers' technical levels. Seventy percent of the factory's original equipment was old-fashioned belt lathes. They cleverly used the gearboxes of old cars to convert some of the belt lathes into automatic lathes. Some enterprises believe that old equipment cannot improve product quality, but this factory has made up for the shortcomings of old equipment by actively improving tools (expanding the coefficient of technological equipment), and also ensuring product quality. For example, in the past, workers' drilling was not straight, and it took a lot of man-hours. The factory then studied and prepared a series of drilling tools. This not only ensured quality and improved work efficiency, but also reduced production costs by more than half. Another positive factor that ensures that this factory can manufacture precision machines is that workers and technicians have worked together to change backward processing methods. For example, the gears produced in the past had a lot of noise when running. The employees studied and changed the original spur gears to 45-degree helical gears, completely eliminating the noise. In the past two years, employees have proposed nearly 30 major methods for improving precision-machined parts. (Wen Tianshen)

    沈阳纺织机械厂克勤克俭办企业
    旧设备制出精密机器
    本报讯　国营沈阳纺织机械厂正式生产纺织机器才只有两年多时间，这期间仅增加了五台新设备，却为国家制造了十多种新产品。其中有种供应现代化纺织厂用的并条机，曾经大量向国外出口。它有流线型钢琴般漂亮的外观，有单个马达传动，还有电气自动停车和指示灯。这个工厂正在试制的自动卷纬机，每分钟转速高达九千转。工程技术人员正在研究把它的性能提高到每分钟一万二千转的国际先进水平。
    这个工厂原来是个修配纺织机械的工厂，为什么它能够很快地制造出许多精密机器呢？这个厂的厂长说，这主要是因为贯彻了中央勤俭办企业的精神，发挥了设备能力，提高工人技术水平的结果。这个工厂原有的设备70％是旧式的皮带车床，他们巧妙地利用旧汽车的变速箱把部分皮带车床改装成了自动车床。有的企业认为，旧设备不能提高产品质量，可是这个工厂却以积极改进工具（扩大工艺装备系数）的办法弥补了旧设备的缺陷，同样保证了产品质量。例如过去工人干活钻孔不直，花费工时大，工厂便研究制备了一系列的钻孔工具，这样不仅保证了质量，提高了工作效率，同时也使生产成本降低了一半以上。这个厂另一个保证能够制造精密机器的积极因素，是工人和技术人员同心协力地改变了落后的工艺加工方法。例如，过去生产的机器齿轮，运转起来噪音大，职工们研究将原来的直齿轮改为四十五度的斜齿轮，彻底消除了噪音。近两年来职工们提出的改进精密加工部件的办法，仅是重大的就将近三十种。　（文天申）
