    Everyone Must Start From the Basis of Six Hundred Million People

    After reading the People's Daily editorial of December 18, 1957, "A Good Way to Solve the Housing Problem for Workers," I felt it was very persuasive, as if it had thoroughly understood the situation of every unit.

    Worker welfare, especially the housing problem, is a rather complex issue, and in the past, people had many opinions on this matter. Accusations such as the organization not caring about people! Utter bureaucracy! Denying housing as intentional retaliation! and so on. In fact, apart from a few cases of inappropriate allocation, most leaders were concerned about the housing issue for workers.

    Our hospital has a head nurse who was allocated a new dormitory room when she got married. After she had a child and hired a nanny, the leadership specially allocated a nanny room for several nannies to share. Not long after, she let a married younger sister live with her. Her sister also had children and needed to hire a nanny, so she repeatedly asked the hospital for housing. When the hospital couldn't meet her demands, she would cry and say it was "inhumane!" Another nurse, who originally lived in a single dormitory, immediately wanted a house when she saw the new dormitories being built. For the sake of housing, her husband, who was a teacher in a middle school in Northeast China, even quit his job and came here. Now that they live together, what about work? So she asked the organization to find a job for her husband. When the leaders couldn't meet her demands, she also called them bureaucrats. The above are just individual examples, and there are even more people from rural areas who blindly flowed into the city without housing, and they also have many opinions.

    The problem now is not only that leaders should consider the issue from the perspective of six hundred million people when dealing with it, but more importantly, the workers who request housing should also start from the perspective of six hundred million people. The solution pointed out by the People's Daily editorial is, in my opinion, a fundamental solution. Now, the visiting relatives regulations (draft) and the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on preventing the blind outflow of rural population have been promulgated. I hope to widely publicize this method among workers. I believe that as long as the reasons are made clear, it will surely win the support of workers across the country.

### 人人都要从六亿人口出发

    人人都要从六亿人口出发
    看了人民日报1957年12月18日“一个解决职工宿舍问题的好办法”的社论以后，觉得非常有说服力，好似摸透了每个单位的情况一样。
    职工福利，尤其是宿舍问题，是一个相当复杂的问题，过去，人们对这个问题的意见很多。指责组织上不关心人啦！十足的官僚主义啦！不配给宿舍是有意报复啦！等等。其实除了少数分配得不够妥当以外，多数领导者都是关心职工住宿问题的。
    我们医院有一位护士长，结婚时配到了新宿舍一间，生了孩子雇上保姆以后，领导上特地拨了一间保姆房间，让数家保姆合住。不久以后，她让一个已出嫁的妹妹住在家里，她妹妹也有孩子，也要雇保姆，于是一而再地向医院要房子。当医院没法满足她的要求时，她就哭哭啼啼地说这是“惨无人道！”另外有位护士，本来是住在单身宿舍里的，看到新宿舍一盖成就马上要房子。为了房子，她的远在东北某中学当教员的丈夫竟弃职而来，现在固然住在一起了，可是工作怎么办？于是她又要求组织上给丈夫介绍工作。当领导上不能满足她的要求的时候，她也骂领导是官僚主义者。以上举的不过是个别例子，至于让农村人口盲目流入城市而没有房子住的就更多了，他们也有很多意见。
    现在的问题，不但是领导者在处理这个问题时要从六亿人口出发，更主要的是要求宿舍的职工也要从六亿人口出发。人民日报社论指出的解决办法，我认为是根本办法。现在，探亲条例（草案）和中共中央、国务院关于制止农村人口盲目外流的指示都已公布，我希望广泛地在职工中宣传这个办法。我相信只要把道理讲清楚，定会取得全国职工的拥护。
