    Stop the Large-Scale Poisoning of Chickens
    Currently, the phenomenon of poisoning chickens and killing chickens on a large scale is occurring in the Songjiang area of Jiangsu. For example, the Fengxian County newspaper once published an exchange of experiences on poisoning chickens under the title "How to Manage Chickens Well." Baoshan County once held a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists in an agricultural cooperative to specifically study how to poison and kill chickens. Similar situations have occurred in other counties such as Qingpu, Shanghai, and Jiading, and in some places, killing chickens is even recorded as work points.
    The main reason why these areas are poisoning and killing chickens on a large scale is because chickens eat grain. In fact, this is a passive method. The active method should be to strengthen management. During the harvest season, the chickens should be kept locked up, and after the harvest, they should be released. This will not only prevent damage to the grain but also allow them to eat some pests, reducing diseases and pests in the coming year. At the same time, chicken and duck manure is also a good fertilizer.
    The situation of poisoning chickens in this area is serious, and we urge the relevant departments to stop it as soon as possible.

### 制止大量毒鸡

    制止大量毒鸡
    目前在江苏松江地区发生毒鸡和大量杀鸡的现象。如奉贤县报曾以“怎样管理好鸡”为标题登载交流毒鸡的经验。宝山县曾有一个农业社召开党团员积极分子会议，专门研究如何毒鸡、杀鸡。其他如青浦、上海、嘉定等县都有类似的情况发生，而且有些地方杀鸡还记工分。
    这些地区所以大量毒鸡、杀鸡，主要是因为鸡吃粮食。其实，这是消极的办法，积极的办法应当加强管理。收获季节将鸡关起来，收获后将鸡放出去。这样不仅不会损坏粮食，而且可以吃掉一部分害虫，减少来年的病虫害。同时鸡鸭粪也是很好的肥料。
    这个地区毒杀鸡的情况是严重的，我们要求有关部门及早制止。
