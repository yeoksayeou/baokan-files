Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 4th: According to recent reports in "Literary Front," the organ of the Bulgarian Writers Association, the Communist Party organization of the Bulgarian Writers Association held a continuous meeting from November 29th to December 1st, 1957, to criticize some party member writers' revisionist views, such as negating the Party's leadership role in literature and art.

    G. F. Gavrilov, Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, and A. V. Avramov, Minister of Science, Art, and Education of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, participated in the meeting.

    Guryashki, the secretary of the Party organization of the Writers Association, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that after the April 1956 Plenary Session of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, some harmful phenomena that had hindered the normal development of writers' creative activities were eliminated, and a situation of rapid upsurge in literary and artistic development appeared. The strength of writers was brought into full play, struggling to complete the tasks put forward by the Party in the field of literature and art. In this process, the ranks of writers became more closely united around the Party and its Central Committee. However, a small number of writers, including some Party member writers, insisted on a position that essentially opposed the Party's literary and artistic policies.

    In his report, Guryashki discussed in detail the revisionist views of some Party member writers, including: "The Party restricts writers' creative activities," "The Party Central Committee should not interfere with what Party member writers write," "Literature and art should mainly reflect the negative phenomena in reality," "Revisionism is the product of dogmatism, not the ideological product of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie," "Socialist realism cannot become the writers' program of action," and so on. He said that these views were not limited to words, but had already been expressed in the works of some writers. It is not difficult to see that these writers' views and actions are opposed to the Party Central Committee's political line.

    Guryashki emphasized that a struggle must be waged against those erroneous and harmful views that have nothing in common with the Leninist principles of literature and art. This struggle is especially necessary because the most obvious revisionist manifestations are disguised under the banner of "defending Leninism."

    Guryashki called on writers to launch a wide-ranging debate against the most important danger currently - bourgeois ideology and revisionist influence. He said that opposing the danger of right-leaning does not at all mean ignoring opposition to dogmatism and sectarianism, or underestimating dogmatism and sectarianism on the literary and artistic front.

    After Guryashki's report, the meeting discussed the leading role of the Party and its Central Committee in literary, artistic, and cultural construction, the creative method of socialist realism, and other issues. Some Party member writers with revisionist views made preliminary self-examinations at the meeting, while others continued to adhere to their erroneous views.

    In his speech after the discussion, Guryashki said that this meeting showed that the vast majority of Party member writers, in the past and now, firmly support the Party on all issues. He pointed out that this meeting was only the beginning of a debate on some basic issues.

    坚决捍卫列宁主义文艺原则
    保作家协会批判修正主义
    据新华社索非亚4日电　据保加利亚作家协会机关报“文学阵线报”最近报道，保加利亚作家协会的共产党组织在1957年11月29日到12月1日连续举行会议，批判了一些党员作家的否定党对文艺的领导作用等修正主义观点。
    保共中央书记加?夫，保共中央科学、艺术和教育部部长阿弗拉莫夫参加了这次会议。
    作家协会党组织书记顾里亚什基在会上作了报告。他指出：保共中央1956年4月全会后，一些曾经阻碍作家创作活动正常发展的有害现象被消除了，文艺发展的迅速高涨的局面出现了，作家的力量都发挥起来，为完成党在文艺方面提出的任务而斗争。在这一过程中，作家的队伍更加紧密地团结在党和它的中央委员会的周围。但是，一小部分作家，其中包括一些党员作家，却坚持实质上是反对党的文艺政策的立场。
    顾里亚什基在报告中较详细地谈到一些党员作家的修正主义观点，这些观点包括：“党限制了作家的创作活动”、“党中央不要过问党员作家写什么”、“文艺主要地应当反映现实中的反面现象”、“修正主义是教条主义的产物，而不是资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想产物”、“社会主义现实主义不能成为作家的活动纲领”，等等。他说，这些观点不只限于口头上，而且已经表现在某些作家的作品中。不难看出，这些作家的观点和行动是反对党中央的政治路线的。
    顾里亚什基强调指出，必须进行斗争来反对那些同列宁主义的文学艺术原则毫无共同之处的错误和有害的观点。这一斗争之所以特别需要，还因为最明显的修正主义表现是用“维护列宁主义”这一旗帜来作掩护的。
    顾里亚什基号召作家们广泛展开辩论，反对目前最主要的危险——资产阶级思想和修正主义影响。他说，反对右倾的危险，完全不意味着忽视反对教条主义和宗派主义，或者低估文艺战线上的教条主义和宗派主义。
    在顾里亚什基报告后，会议讨论了党和它的中央委员会在文艺和文化建设方面的领导作用、社会主义现实主义创作方法等问题。一些有修正主义观点的党员作家在会上进行了初步的自我检查，也有的作家仍继续坚持错误的观点。
    顾里亚什基在讨论后讲话时说，这次会议表明，绝大多数党员作家，过去和现在在所有问题上都是坚决拥护党的。他指出，这次会议仅仅是对一些基本问题进行辩论的开始。
