    Stepping Out of the Office
    Amidst the upsurge of water conservancy construction, the office of the Lianjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangdong Province moved to the countryside. Zhao Huaijun, the First Secretary of the County Committee, visited various water conservancy construction sites every day to inspect and understand the situation. This is Zhao Huaijun (first from the left) discussing work with Deputy County Head Xu Yizhang, the township Party Secretary, and others at the "4-1" Reservoir construction site.
    Xu Yizhang (wearing white), Deputy County Head of Lianjiang County, brought his own tools to participate in the construction of the "4-1" Reservoir. He ate sweet potatoes with the farmers during labor. Xu Yizhang's practical actions changed the idea of ​​"repairing water conservancy to receive subsidies" among the farmers in the county.

    走出办公室
    在兴修水利的高潮中，广东省中共廉江县委的办公室搬到了乡村。县委第一书记赵怀君每天到各水利工地去巡回视察和了解情况。这是赵怀君（左一）正在“四一”水库工地和副县长许以章、乡党委书记等研究工作。
    廉江县副县长许以章（穿白衣者），自带工具，参加“四一”水库的修建。他在劳动中和农民一起吃蕃薯。许以章的实际行动，改变了全县农民“修水利要发补助粮的想法”。　新华社记者　张家昌摄
