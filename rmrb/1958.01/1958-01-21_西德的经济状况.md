West Germany's Economic Situation
    Xi Linsheng

    As the political and economic difficulties within the imperialist camp increase, the contradictions among imperialist countries are becoming increasingly acute. The current weakening of the American "leadership" provides an opportunity for its "allies" to strengthen their position in the Western world. Thus, there is a fierce struggle, both overt and covert, within the imperialist camp. West Germany is particularly ambitious in this struggle, as demonstrated at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. West Germany's ambition has its economic background. The purpose of this article is to provide some material for this background.

    Industrial Production

    Since the end of the war, West Germany's industrial production has recovered and developed extremely rapidly, reaching pre-war levels in 1950. The current level is more than one and a half times higher than before the war. The following table shows the growth of West German industrial production in recent years:

              (1936 = 100)
          Year　　Industrial Production Index
              1948　　63.1
              1949　　89.8
              1950　　113.0
              1951　　134.8
              1952　　144.9
              1953　　158.1
              1954　　177.3
              1955　　204.0
              1956　　213.0
              1957　　249.3

    In the development of West German industrial production, the means of production industry has grown the fastest. Since 1950, the development of the means of production industry has been almost twice the growth rate of the consumer goods industry. The rapid rise of industrial power has made West Germany jump to third place in the capitalist world. In terms of the absolute amount of industrial production, West Germany has already surpassed France. West Germany accounts for 9.4% of the total industrial production in the capitalist world, while France only accounts for 4.2%. In some major industrial products, West Germany has also surpassed the United Kingdom. For example, in 1957, West Germany produced 27 million tons of steel, while the United Kingdom only produced more than 24 million tons. West Germany has also surpassed the United Kingdom and ranks first in Western Europe in the production of pig iron, automobiles, chemical products, aluminum, tractors, cement, man-made fibers, and chemical fertilizers.

    West Germany's continuous progress in industrial production has greatly encouraged the ambitions of West German monopoly capitalists, who openly stated that they want to surpass the United Kingdom in the early 1960s and become the second largest industrial country in the capitalist world after the United States.

    The Resurgence of Monopoly Capital

    With the rapid growth of industrial power, the power of monopoly capital has re-emerged and further developed.

    Those who launched the world wars in the past, after being reorganized and concentrated, have once again dominated the fate of West Germany. Krupp, the arms king who made his fortune by destroying millions of lives, has now become a large concern with assets of 3 billion marks and employing 120,000 workers. It controls a large number of steel plants, shipyards, coal mines, and machine manufacturing plants. The Farben chemical concern, formerly Hitler's arms chemical factory, now has assets of more than 4 billion marks and controls 11 chemical concerns and 82 affiliated enterprises in West Germany.

    The concentration of capital has reached an unprecedented height in German history. Nine steel concerns, including Krupp and Thyssen, monopolize 93.9% of metallurgical industrial production, 99.9% of iron ore mining, 69.9% of coal mining, and 75.2% of coke production. Five automobile concerns control 88.6% of automobile production; five oil concerns control 95.1% of oil production; and only two potash mining concerns monopolize 83.8% of potash mining. The three largest monopoly banks of the former German Empire, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank, have made great progress in re-concentration. Their assets account for 60% of the total banking assets in West Germany, which is more than double the total capital in the pre-war years.

    External Expansion

    The resurgence of West German monopoly capital and the growth of their economic strength have made West Germany a strong competitor in the capitalist world market. In recent years, West Germany has been expanding in the capitalist market faster than any other capitalist country.

    In 1947, West Germany ranked twenty-sixth in trade in the capitalist world, but by 1955 it had surpassed France and ranked third after the United States and the United Kingdom. West Germany's share of total exports in capitalist countries has increased from 1.1% in 1948 to 7.5% in 1955. During the same period, the United States' share fell from 23.7% to 18.8%; the United Kingdom's share fell from 12.1% to 9.9%; France's share only increased from 3.8% to 5.9%. In terms of individual important commodities, West German exports have surpassed the United Kingdom and even the United States.

    A major feature of West Germany's foreign trade is the huge trade surplus. Since 1952, foreign trade has had a surplus year after year, and the surplus has been increasing rapidly. The following table shows the changes in foreign trade in the past few years:
Year　　Exports　　　　　Imports
　　　　Unit: Billion Marks　Percentage 1950=100 Unit: Billion Marks Percentage 1950=100
  1950　8.4　　　　　100　　　　　11.4　　　　　100
  1951　14.6　　　　174　　　　　14.7　　　　　129
  1952　16.9　　　　202　　　　　16.2　　　　　142
  1953　18.5　　　　220　　　　　16.0　　　　　141
  1954　22.1　　　　264　　　　　19.3　　　　　170
  1955　25.7　　　　306　　　　　24.5　　　　　215
  1956　30.8　　　　367　　　　　27.9　　　　　244
  1957 (First Half)　17.3　　　　—　　　　　15.3　　　　　—

    Due to the huge surplus in foreign trade, West Germany's gold and dollar reserves have also increased sharply. By the end of 1957, West Germany's gold and dollar reserves reached 5.712 billion US dollars, more than one and a half times that of the United Kingdom. In the European Payments Union, West Germany is the largest creditor, with a surplus of more than 3.2 billion US dollars by the end of May last year, while the United Kingdom and France are the largest debtors.

    In the struggle for the world market, West Germany is increasingly squeezing out its competitors. In the Western European market, which occupies an important position in the Western world, West Germany has surpassed the United States, the United Kingdom, and France in 1950, 1951, and 1953 respectively and occupies the top position. In 1955, West Germany had an advantage in the imports of ten of the fourteen countries in Western Europe, while the United Kingdom only had an advantage in Denmark, Norway, and Ireland. West Germany has also made rapid progress in the Latin American market. From 1948 to 1957, West Germany's exports to Latin America rose from 6 million US dollars to about 700 million US dollars, an increase of more than 100 times. In 1953, West Germany had surpassed the United Kingdom and France and was second only to the United States. Compared with the United Kingdom, West Germany now has an advantage in the imports of fifteen countries in Latin America, while the United Kingdom still has an advantage in only four countries. In the Middle East market, West Germany had surpassed France as early as 1952 and was second only to the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1948, West Germany's exports to the Near and Middle East were only more than 12 million marks, but in 1956 it reached 2.1 billion marks. West Germany's share in the foreign trade of the ten countries in the Near and Middle East has increased from 6% in 1951 to 18.2% in 1955, while the United Kingdom has fallen from 31% to 26.7% during the same period. The United States' share has also declined. After the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, West Germany took the opportunity to actively expand in this region. West Germany's trade with Iran and Egypt, which were the main trading partners of the United Kingdom in the past, has greatly increased. In Iran, West Germany has even surpassed the United States and the United Kingdom and jumped to the top. West Germany has also made great progress in the Southeast Asian market, with exports to the region increasing from 580 million marks in 1948 to 2.15 billion marks in 1956. West Germany's exports to India, the United Kingdom's main market, have increased particularly rapidly. From 1954 to 1955, the United Kingdom's exports to India increased by 11.3%, while West Germany's increased by 57.3%. In 1956, West Germany's exports to India increased by another 48% compared to 1955. Only in trade with the United States, West Germany is still in deficit and has a large deficit.

    While expanding foreign trade, capital exports have also increased rapidly. In the more than five years since the resumption of capital exports in 1952, West Germany's foreign investment has increased from 27 million marks to 1.658 billion marks, an increase of more than 60 times. This speed is unmatched by other capitalist countries. West Germany's largest investments are in Europe and Latin America, each with 500 million marks. West German capital has now spread to every corner of the capitalist world and infiltrated various industrial and mining enterprises, banks, and other fields.

    The huge development of West Germany's external expansion shows that an old German imperialism has re-emerged in the world and is rapidly changing the balance of power in the capitalist world.

    Several Factors

    The reason why West Germany's economy has been able to develop so rapidly after the war is due to its special favorable factors.

    First of all, West Germany possesses the main industrial base of the former Germany, especially the Ruhr area, an industrial center. Although it went through World War II, this industrial base was not severely damaged in general. For example, according to statistics, the production capacity of the metallurgical industry and mining industry has only decreased by 10%.

    Secondly, an important reason is the support of American monopoly capital. In the early post-war period, the United States provided West Germany with "revival aid" of 14.6 billion marks, which played an important role in restoring West Germany's industry. At the same time, in foreign competition, American monopoly capital has continued to provide assistance to West German monopoly capital in order to use West Germany to counter the forces of the United Kingdom and France. This is conducive to West Germany's external expansion.

    Thirdly, due to the large-scale reconstruction at home and abroad after the war, a high level of industrial demand was formed. After the war, West Germany experienced a huge wave of fixed capital investment. Since June 1948, West Germany's investment has reached as much as 240 billion marks. This is much higher than other Western European countries. This investment boom has powerfully stimulated industrial production, and has also renewed and expanded industrial technical equipment, putting West German industry in a strong competitive position.

    Fourthly, it is the high exploitation of workers by West German monopoly capital. During the Nazi era, German monopoly capital carried out particularly cruel exploitation of workers, pushing their living standards very low. West German monopoly capital inherited this tradition after the war, so West German workers' wage levels are far lower than those of workers in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and other countries. Low wages plus higher labor productivity have created huge profits for West German monopoly capital and made West German commodities have favorable competitive prices in the international market.

    In addition, West Germany's military burden has been lighter than other North Atlantic Group countries in the past few years, which has also enabled it to use more force for industrial production and export competition.

    Current Problems and Future Trends

    But now some favorable factors are slowly disappearing. The development of industrial production has slowed down, and investment is decreasing. The slowdown in industrial development in the past two years can be clearly seen from the following table:
Year　　Growth compared to the previous year %
          1952　　6.4%
          1953　　10.0%
          1954　　11.7%
          1955　　15.0%
          1956　　7.8%
          1957　　6.0%

    The amount of industrial investment has also decreased significantly in the past two years. From 1948 to 1955, the amount of industrial investment increased by an average of 19% per year, and in 1955 it increased by 34%. But in 1956, the amount of investment only increased by 9%, and in the first half of 1957 it only increased by 2% compared to the same period in 1956. The slowdown in industrial activity has led to an increase in the number of unemployed, reaching 1.21 million by the end of last year. The highest number in four years.

    Coexisting with the trend of industrial stagnation is the trend of inflation. From June 1956 to June 1957, the cost of living in West Germany rose by 20%. Inflation has greatly reduced people's purchasing power, causing the domestic sales of industrial products to decline as well.

    At the same time as the domestic market is shrinking, West Germany is also encountering difficulties in terms of external expansion. First of all, the economies of some capitalist countries, which are West Germany's main trading partners, are in recession. This affects the demand for West German industrial products in these countries. This can be seen from the decreasing trend of West German foreign orders. In the first half of 1957, foreign orders for West German factories increased by 12% compared to the same period in 1956, but by July they only increased by 4%, in August they increased by 5%, and in September they only increased by 1%. Secondly, many countries have been in deficit in their trade with West Germany, especially underdeveloped countries, they have already owed West Germany a lot of debt, and they are preparing to reduce their purchases of West German goods. This naturally affects West Germany's export trade. In the first half of last year, the growth rate of West German exports had already decreased compared to last year. The deterioration of trade conditions in the capitalist world is also the reason why West German monopoly capital has become increasingly interested in the prosperous socialist market in recent years.

    Faced with the increasing difficulties in economic development and export trade, West German monopoly capital is taking two measures.

    First, consolidate and strengthen its existing dominant position in the European market and further seize European hegemony. A primary step in this regard is to organize a European Common Market with the other five countries of the European Coal and Steel Community. In the Coal and Steel Community group, West Germany's strength already accounts for more than 45% (excluding the Saar), occupying an absolute advantage. Organizing a common market is not only conducive to West Germany further controlling the Western European continental market, but also opens the door for West German monopoly capital to infiltrate the overseas territories of other members of the common market, especially French North Africa.

    Second, strengthen the competition for overseas markets, especially the activities of infiltrating underdeveloped regions. West Germany is particularly interested in regions such as Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, and has sent a large number of economic delegations to these regions to conduct activities everywhere.

    Due to the increasing difficulties in export trade, and at the same time a large surplus of funds, West German monopoly capital is now particularly keen on foreign investment. The Federation of German Industries announced in November last year: it is necessary to greatly strengthen capital exports. Adenauer recently publicly stated that West Germany is preparing a huge "aid program" for underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa.

    This ambitious plan of West German monopoly capital will inevitably increase its contradictions with other imperialist countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Since the United States still retains a considerable influence on West Germany, some West German large monopoly capital and American monopoly capital still have many connections. They still hope to get American support when competing with British monopoly capital and further expanding into backward areas. Therefore, in the initial stage of realizing the West German monopoly capital plan, West Germany temporarily expresses obedience to the United States, and first directs the spearhead at the United Kingdom and France. However, as West Germany's economic strength further grows, the contradictions between West Germany and the United States will inevitably become acute.

    西德的经济状况
    席林生
    随着帝国主义阵营政治和经济方面困难的增加，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾也愈来愈尖锐。目前美国“领导地位”的削弱，对于它的“盟国”，是加强自己在西方世界的地位的机会。这样，就在帝国主义阵营里出现了激烈的明争暗斗的现象。在这一斗争中间，西德是特别野心勃勃的，正像在北大西洋公约巴黎会议上所表现出来的一样。西德的这种野心，有它的经济背景。本文的目的就是要为这种背景提供一些材料。
    工业生产
    战后以来，西德工业生产的恢复和发展极其迅速，在1950年，即已达到战前的水平。而目前水平更超过战前约一倍半。战后历年西德工业生产增长的情况如下表：
              （以1936年＝100）
          年　份　工业生产指数
              1948　63.1
              1949　89.8
              1950　113.0
              1951　134.8
              1952　144.9
              1953　158.1
              1954　177.3
              1955　204.0
              1956　213.0
              1957　249.3
    在西德工业生产的发展中，增长速度最快的是生产资料工业。从1950年以来，生产资料工业的发展几乎等于消费品工业增长速度的两倍。工业力量的急剧上升，已使西德一跃而居于资本主义世界中的第三位。在工业生产的绝对量上西德已经超过法国。在资本主义世界工业总生产中，西德所占比重达9.4％，而法国只有4.2％。在一些主要工业产品方面，西德还赶过了英国。例如，1957年西德生产了二千七百万吨钢，而英国只有二千四百多万吨。在生铁、汽车、化学制品、铝、拖拉机、水泥、人造纤维、化学肥料等生产方面，西德也已经超过英国而居于西欧的第一位。
    西德在工业生产上的节节进展大大激励起西德垄断资本家的野心，他们公开表示要在二十世纪六十年代初期超过英国而成为居于美国之后的资本主义世界第二位工业国家。
    垄断资本的再起
    随着工业力量的急速增长，垄断资本的势力已经重新抬头并进一步发展起来。
    过去那些发动世界大战的罪魁，经过重新组织和集中，已经再度主宰着西德的命运。曾经靠毁灭千百万人的生命而发迹起来的枪炮大王克虏伯，今天重又变为拥有三十亿马克资产和雇佣十二万工人的大康采恩了。它控制着大批钢铁厂、造船工厂、煤矿、机器制造厂。曾经是希特勒军火化学工厂的法本化学康采恩，现在拥有四十亿马克以上的资产，并控制着西德十一个化学康采恩和八十二个附属企业。
    资本的集中达到了德国历史上空前高度。包括克虏伯和蒂森的九个钢铁康采恩垄断了冶金工业生产的93.9％，铁矿开采量的99.9％，煤开采量的69.9％，焦炭生产的75.2％。五个汽车康采恩控制了汽车生产的88.6％；五个石油康采恩控制了石油生产的95.1％；而仅仅二个钾矿康采恩就垄断了钾矿开采的83.8％。前德意志帝国的三家最大垄断银行：德意志银行、德累斯顿银行和商业银行重新集中有很大进展。它们拥有的资产占了西德全部银行资产的60％，已超过战前年代总资本一倍以上。
    对外扩张
    西德垄断资本的再起以及它们经济实力的增长，使得西德又成为资本主义世界市场上的一个强有力的竞争者。几年来西德在资本主义市场上进行扩张，速度比任何其他一个资本主义国家都快。
    1947年西德在资本主义世界贸易中居于第二十六位，但是到1955年已超过法国，居美英之后而名列第三。在资本主义国家输出总额中，西德所占比重已经从1948年的1.1％增加到1955年的7.5％。而同期美国的比重从23.7％降到18.8％；英国从12.1％降到9.9％；法国只从3.8％增加到5.9％。在个别重要商品方面，西德出口已经超过英国甚至美国。
    西德对外贸易的一个主要特点，是巨大的贸易顺差。从1952年以来对外贸易连年出超，而且出超额迅速增大。过去几年对外贸易变化的情况如下表：年　份　输　出　输　入单　位：十亿马克百分比1950＝100单　位：十亿马克百分比1950＝100
  1950　8.4　100　11.4　100
  1951　14.6　174　14.7　129
  1952　16.9　202　16.2　142
  1953　18.5　220　16.0　141
  1954　22.1　264　19.3　170
  1955　25.7　306　24.5　215
  1956　30.8　367　27.9　244
  1957（上半年）　17.3　—　15.3　—　
    由于对外贸易的巨大顺差，西德的黄金美元储备也急剧增加。到1957年底西德的黄金美元储备达到五十七亿一千二百万美元，比英国多一倍半以上。在欧洲支付同盟中西德是最大的债权国，至去年5月底共盈余了三十二亿多美元，而英、法则是最大的债务国。
    在争夺世界市场的斗争中西德正愈来愈有力地排挤着它的竞争者。在西方世界中占重要地位的西欧市场上，西德已经分别在1950、1951、1953几年中先后赶过美英法而占着首位。1955年在西欧十四个国家的进口中，西德占优势的有十个国家，而英国只有在丹麦、挪威和爱尔兰三个国家还占有优势。在拉丁美洲市场上，西德的进展也极为迅速。从1948年到1957年，西德对拉丁美洲的出口从六百万美元上升到七亿美元左右，增加了一百多倍。在1953年西德即已超过英法而仅次于美国。和英国相比，现在西德在拉丁美洲十五个国家的入口中占有优势，而只有在四个国家中英国还占着优势。在中东市场上，西德早在1952年就超过法国而仅次于美英。1948年西德对中近东的输出只有一千二百多万马克，1956年已达到二十一亿马克。在中近东十个国家的对外贸易中，西德所占比重已经从1951年的6％上升到1955年的18.2％，而同期英国却从31％下跌到26.7％。美国所占的分额也有了下降。在英、法侵埃战争失败后，西德更乘机积极地在这地区进行扩张。西德对过去英国在这地区的主要贸易对象伊朗和埃及的贸易已大为增加，在伊朗，西德甚至超过英美而跃居首位。在东南亚市场上西德也获得了很大的进展，对该地区的输出已经从1948年的五亿八千万马克增加到1956年的二十一亿五千万马克。西德对英国的主要市场印度的输出特别增加得快。1954年到1955年，英国对印度输出增长了11.3％，而西德却增长了57.3％。1956年西德对印度的输出又比1955年增加了48％。只有在对美国的贸易中西德至今仍是入超累累，赤字很大。
    在对外贸易扩张的同时，资本输出也迅速增加。从1952年开始恢复资本输出以来的五年多中，西德在国外投资已经从两千七百万马克增加到十六亿五千八百万马克，增加了六十倍多。这个速度是其他资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。西德最大的投资是在欧洲和拉丁美洲，各为五亿马克。现在西德的资本已经遍及资本主义世界各个角落，并渗入各种工矿企业、银行等范围。
    西德对外扩张的巨大发展，表明一个旧日的德国帝国主义又重新在世界上出现了，并且正在急剧地改变着资本主义世界力量的对比。
    几个因素
    西德战后经济所以能够发展得这样迅速，是有它的特殊的有利因素的。
    首先，西德拥有过去德国的主要工业基地，特别如鲁尔区这样一个工业重地。虽然经过第二次世界大战，但是一般来说这个工业基地并没有遭到严重的破坏。例如据统计，冶金工业和矿业的生产能力只减少了10％。
    其次，一个重要原因是美国垄断资本的扶植。战后初期美国曾经给于西德“复兴援助”达一百四十六亿马克，这对恢复西德的工业起了重要的作用。同时在对外竞争中，美国垄断资本为了利用西德对抗英法势力也不断给予西德垄断资本以帮助。这有利于西德对外扩张。
    第三，由于国内外在战后的大规模重新建设，形成了高度的工业需要，在战后西德出现了巨大的固定资本投资热潮。从1948年6月以来西德的投资已达二千四百亿马克之巨。这比其他西欧国家都要高得多。这种投资热潮有力地刺激了工业的生产，又更新和扩大了工业技术设备，使西德工业处于有力的竞争地位。
    第四，是西德垄断资本对工人的高度剥削。在纳粹时代，德国垄断资本对工人进行了特别残酷的剥削，把他们的生活水平压得很低。战后西德垄断资本继承了这个传统，因此西德工人工资水平远较英国、法国、比利时等工人为低。低廉的工资加上较高的劳动生产率就为西德垄断资本造成了巨额的利润，并使得西德商品在国际市场上有有利的竞争价格。
    此外，过去几年西德军备负担较其他北大西洋集团国家为轻，这也使它能够以较多的力量用于工业生产和出口竞争。
    目前的问题和今后的趋势
    但是现在一些有利的因素正在慢慢消失作用。工业生产的发展已在减缓、投资在减少。最近两年工业发展减慢的趋势从下表可以明显地看出来：年　份比上一年增长％
          1952　6.4％
          1953　10.0％
          1954　11.7％
          1955　15.0％
          1956　7.8％
          1957　6.0％
    工业投资额在过去两年中间也有显著降低。从1948年到1955年工业投资额每年平均增加19％，1955年更增加了34％。但是在1956年投资额只增加了9％，1957年上半年比1956年同期只增加2％。工业活动的减慢已使得失业人数增加，到去年底失业人数达到一百二十一万人。为四年来的最高数字。
    和工业发展停滞趋势并存的是通货膨胀的趋势。1956年6月到1957年6月西德生活费用上涨了20％。通货膨胀大大降低了人民的购买力，使得工业品在国内销售额也随之下落。
    和国内市场缩小同时，在对外扩张方面西德也遭遇到了困难。首先是作为西德主要贸易对象的一些资本主义国家经济都在衰退。这就影响到这些国家里对西德工业品的需求。这一点从西德国外定货的减少趋势可以看出来。1957年上半年西德工厂的国外定货比1956年同期增加12％，到7月只增加4％，8月增加5％，9月只增加了1％了。其次，许多国家在对西德贸易中一直入超，特别是经济不发达的国家，它们已欠下了西德不少债，都在准备减少购买西德的商品。这自然影响到西德的出口贸易。去年上半年，西德出口的增加率已比去年减少。资本主义世界市场上贸易条件恶化，也是西德垄断资本近年来对繁荣的社会主义市场日益感兴趣的原因。
    面对着经济发展和出口贸易方面日益增加的困难，西德垄断资本正在采取两方面的措施。
    第一，巩固和加强在欧洲市场上既得的优势地位，进一步攫取欧洲霸权。在这方面的一个首要的步骤就是同欧洲煤钢联营的其他五个国家组织欧洲共同市场。在煤钢联营集团中，西德力量已经占45％以上（还不包括萨尔），居于绝对优势地位。组织共同市场不仅有利于西德进一步控制西欧大陆市场，而且也为西德垄断资本渗入共同市场其他成员国的海外领土特别是法属北非开方便之门。
    第二，加强争夺海外市场、特别渗入经济不发达地区的活动。西德对拉丁美洲、中东、非洲和东南亚等地区特别感觉兴趣，派遣了大批经济代表团去这些地区到处进行活动。
    由于出口贸易的困难增加，同时资金大量过剩，西德垄断资本现在特别热衷于对外投资。西德工业家联合会去年11月宣布：必须大大加强资本输出。阿登纳不久前公开表示，西德正在准备一项给亚非两洲不发达国家巨大的“援助计划”。
    西德垄断资本这种野心勃勃的计划必然会增加它同美英等其他帝国主义国家的矛盾。由于目前美国对西德仍保有不小影响，一些西德大垄断资本和美国垄断资本还有千丝万缕的联系，它们在同英国垄断资本进行竞争和进一步向落后地区扩张时还希望得到美国的支持。因此，在实现西德垄断资本计划的最初阶段，西德暂时对美国还表示顺从，而把矛头首先对着英法。但是随着西德经济实力的进一步增长，西德跟美国之间的矛盾也将会不可避免地尖锐起来。
