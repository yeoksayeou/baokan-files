Sweet Potato is a Treasure
Sichuan Makes 142 Kinds of Sweet Potato Foods

Chengdu, January 27th (This newspaper) – Various brewing, manufacturing, food, and catering industries in Sichuan are paying great attention to utilizing sweet potatoes. They are processing them meticulously and have trial-produced eight categories and one hundred and forty-two kinds of palatable foods from sweet potatoes, including wine, dried noodles, soy sauce, vinegar, candy, pastries, dishes, and common snacks, which are welcomed by the vast number of people in urban and rural areas.

Sichuan Province produces approximately 28.8 billion jin of sweet potatoes annually, accounting for about 15% of the total grain output; in some areas, sweet potato production accounts for 60% of the total grain output. In the past, due to the strong seasonality of sweet potato production, concentrated market supply, and difficulty in storage, spoilage losses were significant. At the same time, due to transportation difficulties, the amount of sweet potatoes shipped to cities in previous years accounted for only 2% to 3% of the total output. Last year, in order to enable farmers in the main sweet potato producing areas to eat more fine grains and to enable urban residents to eat more sweet potatoes, the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau and Service Bureau decided to universally adopt the method of meticulous processing of sweet potatoes throughout the province to produce a variety of sweet potato foods. In the process of promoting sweet potato processing, some areas also held sweet potato food exhibitions.

Currently, the Chengdu Local State-owned Winery has used sweet potatoes to produce white wine, rose wine, and lemon wine, with every 700 jin of sweet potatoes yielding 100 jin of wine. The Chengdu New Shanghai Food Factory, Wenhua Food Factory, Suining Candy Factory, Yibin Hongxin Processing Factory, and others have used sweet potatoes to make biscuits, bread, cakes, and various fruit candies. Famous restaurants such as Chengdu Jingchengyuan have also made sweet potatoes into twenty-four dishes and twenty-one common snacks. (Ding Fan)

    甘薯是个宝
    四川制成142种甘薯食品
    本报成都27日电　四川各地酿酒业、酿造业、食品业、饮食业很重视利用甘薯。他们进行加工细作，把甘薯试制成酒、挂面、酱油、醋、糖果、糕点、菜肴、家常小吃等八类一百四十二种可口的食品，受到城乡广大人民的欢迎。
    四川省每年大约生产甘薯二百八十八亿斤，约占粮食总产量的15％；有的地区甘薯产量占粮食总产量的60％。过去由于甘薯生产季节性强，上市集中，保管不易，霉烂损失甚大；同时由于运输困难，往年运销城市的甘薯仅占总产量的2％到3％。去年，四川省粮食厅、服务厅为了使甘薯主产区农民多吃一些细粮，使城镇居民多吃一些甘薯，决定在全省各地普遍采用甘薯加工细作的办法，制成多种多样的甘薯食品。在推广甘薯加工的过程中，有的地区还举办了甘薯食品展览会。
    现在，成都地方国营酒厂已经利用甘薯制成白酒、玫瑰酒、柠檬酒等，每七百斤甘薯可以酿酒一百斤。成都新上海食品厂、文华食品厂、遂宁糖果厂、宜宾宏新加工厂等，用甘薯制成饼干、面包、蛋糕和各种水果糖。成都竟成园等著名饭馆，还把甘薯制成了二十四种菜肴和二十一种家常小吃。　　　（丁帆）
