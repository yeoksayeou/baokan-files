    The Train is Coming!
    The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, which is under construction, starts from Baotou in Inner Mongolia in the north and ends in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, in the south, with a total length of 1,009 kilometers. Now the northern section of track laying has passed Baiyin City.
    The train drove into the grassland, and Grandpa Dai, who was over eighty years old, was very happy to see it. Photo by Zhao Xiuzhu

    火车来了！
    正在修筑的包兰铁路，北起内蒙古的包头，南到甘肃省的兰州，全线长达一千零九公里。现在北段铺轨已经铺过了白银市。
    火车开进了草原，八十多岁的戴老大爷看见了，真是高兴。赵修柱摄
