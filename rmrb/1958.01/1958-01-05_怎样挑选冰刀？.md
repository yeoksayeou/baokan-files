Ice skates come in three types: figure skates – used for general skating practice and ice games. Speed ​​skates – used for ice racing. Hockey skates – used for playing ice hockey.

Here is a simple method for choosing:

(1) Pick up the back support of the skate with one finger, and tap the blade with a finger of the other hand. If it makes a "ding-ding" sound without any noise, it is good.

(2) Gently rub the edges of two blades against each other. If they make a rustling sound, they are better; if they are slippery, the wear resistance will be poor.

(3) The blade holder should be straight and strong; the electroplating should be uniform, and the blade should not have heavy skin or cracks.

When installing ice skates, you must use round-head screws specifically for ice skates. The skates should be accurately and firmly installed in the middle of the sole. If the blade is installed incorrectly or unstable, it is easy to fall while skating.

After skating, be sure to wipe the surface of the ice skate dry with a cloth. Speed ​​skates and hockey skates should have the water shaken out of the tube. When the skating season ends, you can apply some acid-free butter to the ice skate and store it in a dry place to prevent rust. (Xing)

    怎样挑选冰刀？
    冰刀有三种：花样冰刀——是一般练习滑冰和作冰上游戏用的刀。跑刀——是冰上赛跑用的刀。球刀——打冰球时用的。
    挑选的简单方法介绍如下：
    （一）用一只手指挑着刀的后托，用另一只手的手指敲弹刀身，如果发出噹噹的声音而没有杂音，就是好的。
    （二）将两把刀口互相轻轻摩擦，如果发出沙沙的声音，就比较好；如果滑溜溜的，耐磨力就差。
    （三）刀托要正，要坚固；电镀要均匀，刀身不能有重皮、裂纹现象。
    安装冰刀时，必须使用冰刀专用的圆帽螺钉。冰刀应该准确地、牢固地安装在鞋底中间。如果刀身安得不正、不稳，滑行时容易?跤。
    滑冰后，务必用布将冰刀表面擦干，跑刀和球刀要将筒内存水甩净。当滑冰的季节结束时，可在冰刀上涂一些没有酸性的黄油，放在干燥的地方，以防生锈。　（邢）
