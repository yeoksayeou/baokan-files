    Family Work Must Not Be Neglected
    In the upsurge of cadres going to lower levels for labor training, one situation cannot be ignored: some cadres originally strongly requested to go to lower levels, but as soon as they returned home, they were surrounded by their families, who wouldn't allow them to go, and even the cadres themselves wavered.
    This situation shows that in the work of sending cadres to lower levels, ideological work must be done not only on the cadres themselves, but also on the cadres' families. In a sense, doing family work is even more important than doing work on the cadres themselves. Because whether the family work is done well is directly related to whether the cadres can go to their new labor posts with a happy mood, and whether they can labor well and be reformed well at the lower levels.
    Sending cadres to lower levels is a good thing, as it is intended to improve and cultivate cadres. Every family member loves their relatives and hopes that their relatives can become useful people for the country and the people. So, why does it happen that cadres themselves request to go to lower levels, but their families insist on holding them back? It turns out that some family members do not understand the significant political meaning of cadres going to lower levels for labor training, nor do they understand the benefits of participating in labor at the lower levels for their relatives and the country; some have practical difficulties in their families and are afraid that no one will help solve them after their relatives go to lower levels; some are afraid that life and labor in rural areas or grassroots units are too hard for their relatives to bear; and some are simply "reluctant" and do not want their relatives to leave their side. In short, family members holding back involves ideological and cognitive issues, as well as practical life issues. These problems require timely assistance from the leaders of relevant units. To help families solve these problems, it is necessary to do in-depth and meticulous family work.
    Not only should in-depth and meticulous family work be done before cadres are sent to lower levels, explaining to the families the significance of cadres going to lower levels for labor training, resolving the doubts and problems existing in the families' minds, and helping families with practical difficulties to solve some specific problems. Moreover, after the cadres are sent to lower levels, it is necessary to continue to do family work, understand the families' new ideological situations and problems, care for their lives, and help them solve some difficulties as much as possible, taking responsibility for the families to the end.
    The leaders of the Ministry of Railways, precisely because they recognized the significant impact of family work on the work of sending cadres to lower levels, dispatched a large number of personnel to patiently and meticulously do a lot of work for the families of the dispatched employees. In particular, after Comrade Chang Xuezheng was sent to the lower levels, the leaders of the Statistics Bureau carefully discovered and timely helped his family solve their difficulties; the leaders of the Labor and Wage Bureau helped Niu Wenxiang solve a family dispute that had not been resolved for more than ten years, which is very touching. Their work vividly embodies the Party and the state's deep concern for cadres and the spirit of taking responsibility to the end, and embodies the spirit of the Party's cadre line that sending cadres to lower levels is for the purpose of training and improving cadres, and is definitely not about shirking responsibility. The family work of the Ministry of Railways is worthy of being learned from by other units.

### 家属工作不容忽视

    家属工作不容忽视
    在干部下放劳动锻炼的热潮中，不能忽视这样一种情况：有的干部本人原来要求下放很坚决，但一回到家里，就被家属包围，不让下放，甚至本人也就动摇了。
    这种情况，说明在下放干部的工作中，不但要对干部本人做思想工作，而且要对干部家属做思想工作。在某种意义上说，做家属工作甚至比对干部本人做工作还重要。因为家属工作做得好不好，直接关系到干部能不能心情舒畅地走上新的劳动岗位，能不能在下面劳动得好，改造得好的问题。
    干部下放是一件好事情，是为了提高和培养干部。每个家属都热爱自己的亲人，都希望自己的亲人能够成为一个对国家、对人民有用的人。那么，为什么又会发生干部本人要求下放而家属偏偏要拉后腿的情况呢？原来有些家属是因为不了解干部下放劳动锻炼的重大政治意义，不了解下放参加劳动对自己的亲人、对国家有什么好处；有的是因为自己家庭中有实际困难，怕自己的亲人下放以后没人帮助解决；有的是怕农村或基层单位生活苦、劳动苦，自己的亲人吃不消；有的就是出于单纯的“舍不得”，不愿意自己的亲人离开身边。总之，家属拉后腿，有思想上、认识上的问题，也有实际生活中的问题。这些问题，都需要有关单位的领导上及时帮助解决。要帮助家属解决这些问题，就必须深入、细致地做家属工作。
    不但在干部下放以前要深入、细致地做家属工作，要向家属讲清干部下放劳动锻炼的意义，解决家属思想上存在的疑虑和问题，帮助有实际困难的家属解决一些具体困难。而且，干部下放以后还要继续做家属工作，了解家属新的思想情况和问题，关怀他们的生活，尽可能地帮助他们解决一些困难，对家属负责到底。
    铁道部领导上正是由于认识到家属工作对干部下放工作的重大影响，因此抽出了大批人力，耐心地、细致地对下放职工家属做了许多工作。特别是在常学正同志下放以后，统计局领导同志细心地发现并及时帮助他家解决困难的情形；劳动工资局领导上帮助牛文祥解决了十几年不能解决的家庭纠纷的事情，使人十分感动。他们的工作，生动地体现了党和国家对干部深切的关怀和负责到底的精神，体现了下放干部是为了锻炼、提高干部，决不是甩包袱的党的干部路线的精神。铁道部的家属工作，值得其他单位借鉴。
