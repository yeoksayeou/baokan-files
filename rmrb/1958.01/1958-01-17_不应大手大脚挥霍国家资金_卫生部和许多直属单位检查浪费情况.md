The Ministry of Health and its directly subordinate units recently inspected instances of extravagance and waste, and discovered that the phenomenon of reckless spending and the resulting accumulation of national funds was very serious.

In terms of the purchase of equipment, some units, without considering the current economic situation of the country, blindly pursued modernization, resulting in a large amount of accumulation and waste. For example, the Institute of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health ordered a Type C electrostatic electron microscope from abroad in 1953, at a cost of 300,000 yuan. This precious instrument, the only one of its kind in the Ministry of Health, was only used once for an operational demonstration for the graduation of the first advanced training class in epidemiology, and once for an informal specimen photograph of "Brucella." It has never been formally used in epidemiological research work. Currently, although someone is responsible for dust prevention, moisture prevention, and other maintenance work, the machine is malfunctioning and experiencing obstacles due to long-term disuse. In addition, in recent years, the institute has purchased many instruments that have been left idle in the warehouse, including a spectrograph worth more than 13,000 yuan, an electrophoresis apparatus, and a vacuum freeze dryer worth more than 30,000 yuan, all of which have failed to play their due role.

The Shanghai First Medical College of the Ministry of Health needed carotene for its research work. The annual consumption was usually one to two grams, but they purchased one hundred grams from abroad, worth 8,000 yuan, enough for the college to use for fifty to one hundred years. The Beijing Northwest Wang Medicinal Plant Planting Farm of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences of the Ministry of Health spent nearly 10,000 yuan to buy a tractor from abroad, but because it did not come with an attached cultivator, they had to use the tractor to pull a horse-drawn double-wheeled double-share plow, until they bought a formal cultivator half a year later. In order to increase the application of "green manure," the farm did not hesitate to plow all fifty acres of soybeans into the ground. In 1956, the Harbin Medical College of the Ministry of Health, disregarding the budget situation for 1957, blindly ordered books from abroad worth more than 170,000 yuan, which not only caused accumulation but also created serious confusion in terms of financial expenditure.

Due to the serious subjectivism of the leading comrades of the Ministry of Health and some of its affiliated units, and their lack of a perspective starting from the 600 million people, improper work arrangements have also caused serious waste. A new hospital started construction in 1955, with very high construction costs. All rooms were single-person wards, and the building area was very large. One hundred beds totaled 8,889 square meters, with an average of 88.69 square meters per bed. Compared with the quota of 37.7 square meters per bed set by the Ministry of Health, it was more than double the amount, with a total expenditure of more than 1.9 million yuan for civil engineering and installation.

In 1956, the epidemic encephalitis vaccine produced by the Beijing Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health caused people to faint during use. At that time, the Ministry of Health notified the units using it to suspend use, but due to the fact that the leaders of the Ministry of Health were high above and work was slow, a conclusion could not be reached in a timely manner. Although it was during the epidemic period of brain inflammation in some provinces and cities, it could not be used. After a conclusion of qualified quality was reached, the vaccine's effectiveness and the encephalitis epidemic period had passed, and the vaccine became waste, which not only caused a loss of 223,000 yuan in national funds but also affected the completion of epidemic prevention tasks. The serum originally produced by the Shanghai and Wuhan Biological Products Research Institutes of the Ministry of Health was very popular in various places. Later, the Ministry of Health decided that other research institutes should produce serum, and the Shanghai Biological Products Research Institute alone abandoned its original six horse stables with 300 horses and its original building equipment from 1956.

The waste situation at the Beijing Fuchengmenwai Hospital was very serious due to inappropriately raised construction standards. Most of the wards in the hospital were single-person and two-person wards, and the building area was also very large. Three hundred beds totaled 21,072 square meters, with an average of 70.24 square meters per bed, more than double the required area. Due to excessive demands, the exterior wall facing of the main building of the hospital alone cost 50,000 yuan. At a time when the supply of steel pipes at various construction sites was very tight, the hospital also used steel pipe stair railings. Compared with general hospitals of the same scale, the hospital wasted approximately 2 million yuan in national funds.

The serious waste of some directly subordinate units of the Ministry of Health is also specifically reflected in housing and daily life. Among some health workers, there is a fairly serious bourgeois hedonistic ideology, and they pay attention to ostentation. For example, the Nanjing Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences of the Ministry of Health rented 36 houses in Shanghai in March 1956, and soon bought houses in Nanjing for 330,000 yuan. The houses in Shanghai were empty for four months, with a rent expenditure of nearly 7,000 yuan. However, after the institute purchased the houses in Nanjing, it decided to move to Shanghai. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital converted 1,000 square meters of high-grade buildings into research rooms, spending nearly 30,000 yuan on repairs.

    不应大手大脚挥霍国家资金
    卫生部和许多直属单位检查浪费情况
    本报讯　卫生部和它的直属单位最近检查了铺张浪费情况，发现胡花乱用，造成国家资金积压的现象很为严重。
    在仪器设备的购置方面，有些单位不考虑国家的当前经济情况，盲目地追求现代化，是一笔很大的积压浪费。如卫生部流行病学研究所在1953年向国外订购的一台C型静电式电子显微镜，价值三十万元。这架卫生部仅有的珍贵仪器，除去为第一期流行病进修班学员毕业时作了一次操作表演和作了一次非正式的“布氏杆菌”的标本照像以外，在流行病研究工作上，从来没有正式使用过它。目前，该所虽有人负责进行防尘、防潮等维护工作，但由于长期不用，机件失灵并发生障碍。此外，几年来，该所还购进很多仪器，也闲置在仓库里，其中有一台光谱仪价值一万三千多元，电泳器、真空冷冻干燥器等价值三万多元，都没有发挥应有的作用。
    卫生部上海第一医学院研究工作上需要的胡萝卜素，经常年用量为一到二克，他们却从国外购进了一百克，价值人民币八千元，足够该院五十年到一百年之用。卫生部中国医学科学院北京西北旺药用植物种植场，花了近一万元从国外买进一台拖拉机，因没有附带的机耕犁，只得用拖拉机拖着马拉的双轮双铧犁，直到半年后才买到了正式机耕犁。该场为了增施“绿肥”，不惜把五十亩大豆全部翻在地里。卫生部哈尔滨医学院在1956年，不顾1957年的预算情况，盲目向国外订购价值十七万多元的图书，不仅造成压积，而且造成资金开支方面的严重混乱现象。
    由于卫生部及其所属某些单位领导同志存在严重的主观主义，缺乏从六亿人民出发的观点，工作安排不当，也造成了严重的浪费。在1955年开始新建一个医院，造价很高，全部是一人病房，建筑面积很大，一百床位共计八千八百八十九平方公尺，平均每床位占八十八点六九平方公尺。如按卫生部的定额，每床三十七点七平方公尺来比较，高出了二倍，全部土建及安装工程共计开支一百九十多万元。
    1956年卫生部北京生物制品研究所生产的流行性脑炎疫苗，在使用注射中曾发生人晕倒的情况。当时卫生部曾通知使用单位暂停使用，但由于卫生部的领导高高在上，工作拖拉，未能及时作出结论，虽然处在某些省市大脑炎流行期而未能使用，待作出质量合格的结论后，疫苗有效和脑炎流行期已过，疫苗即成废品，不仅损失国家资金二十二万三千元，而且影响了防疫任务的完成。卫生部上海、武汉生物制品研究所原生产的血清在各地很受欢迎，后来卫生部确定要其他研究所生产血清，仅上海生物制品研究所即将原有三百匹马的马厩六幢及其原有建筑设备从1956年弃置不用。
    北京阜城门外医院由于不恰当的提高建筑标准，浪费的情况非常严重。该院大部病房是一人病房和二人病房，建筑面积也很大，三百床位共计二万一千零七十二平方公尺，每床位平均为七十点二四平方公尺，超过应有面积的一倍以上。由于要求过高，该院的主楼外墙贴面砖就用了五万元。在当时各工地钢管供应情况非常紧张的情况下，该院还用了钢管楼梯扶手。若与相同规模的一般医院比较起来，该院约浪费国家资金二百万元左右。
    卫生部有些直属单位的严重浪费，也具体地表现在住房和日常生活方面。在有些卫生工作人员中，存在着相当严重的资产阶级的享乐思想，讲求排场。如卫生部中国医学科学院南京寄生虫病研究所，于1956年3月在上海租了三十六幢房子，不久又在南京以三十三万元购买了房子，上海的房子空了四个月，支出租金近七千元。可是，该所在南京把房子购妥后，又决定搬去上海。中苏友谊医院将一千平方公尺高级建筑改为研究室，共用去修缮费近三万元。
