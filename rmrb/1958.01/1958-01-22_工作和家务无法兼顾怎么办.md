What to Do When Work and Housework Cannot Be Balanced
By our reporter Jin Yukun

A responsible comrade from the Liaoning Provincial Department of Commerce recently returned from inspecting work in Anshan and Dalian and told the reporter about two things he heard:

In Dalian, someone calculated the accounts for a female salesperson at the Tianjin Street Department Store. This salesperson was a mother of four children. If the mother is to work, the children must be taken care of. Therefore, her two older children were sent to a kindergarten (full-time), so the enterprise had to pay her 45 yuan per month for childcare fees (currently, in general nurseries here, employees only pay for the children's food, and the public subsidizes each child with more than 20 to 30 yuan per month), and the other two younger children were sent to a nursing room (day care), and the enterprise also had to subsidize 25 yuan per month. In this way, the public subsidized her a total of more than 70 yuan. Her entire basic salary was only more than 40 yuan. This additional wage alone (not including others) was much more than her basic salary.

A nursery worker in a kindergarten affiliated with the Lüda City Bureau of Commerce already had four children, three of whom were in the kindergarten full-time, and one in day care. According to the general quota of nursery workers in Lüda taking care of four to five children, this is equivalent to the state giving her a salary, and she only completed the task of taking care of her own children. A bureau chief in the bureau joked: In a few years, our kindergarten nursery workers will not have to have four children each, but when they all have three children each, then the kindergarten will only be able to accommodate the children of the nursery workers!

These two examples, on the one hand, illustrate that in our country, in order to enable women to participate in the country's political life in the same way as men, and to participate in various kinds of labor within their capabilities, the state has done everything possible to spend a lot of money to create working conditions for them. This was unimaginable in the old society. At the same time, on the other hand, it also reflects such a problem: Although it is necessary to give appropriate care to employees with many children, the current problem is that the state's burden in this regard is indeed too heavy, especially compared with the country's current economic situation and her own labor contribution, it seems disproportionate and unreasonable. Therefore, it is worth considering: for some female employees with many children, when their living and physiological conditions have undergone great changes, and it is difficult to balance work and housework, is it more beneficial to the country and the individual to continue to increase the state's burden and continue to work in the enterprise? Or is it more beneficial to the country and the individual to temporarily change the nature of labor and engage in labor suitable for her own conditions?

However, some female comrades do not consider it this way. They believe that to solve this contradiction, we should mainly rely on large-scale state investment to continue to rapidly develop the childcare industry. We believe that this is not only impossible under the current conditions, but also should not be done. According to the inspection of the commercial departments in Anshan and Dalian, it is believed that the current number of nurseries is not small, but quite a few, and the state's burden in this regard is not light, but too heavy. In those places, almost every store has a nursery behind it. The store manager's energy has been greatly affected by the nursery problem. The Anshan City Commercial System has 49 nurseries, with a total construction area of more than 5,000 square meters, which is larger than the largest large store in Anshan—the Youth Store with more than 1,000 employees and a business area of more than 3,000 square meters. However, it is still far from meeting the actual needs. According to the survey, to fully meet the needs, it is necessary to increase the existing nursery area by more than double. And even if it is increased in this way, the problem of existing children entering nurseries is solved, but children will continue to be born next year, and the problem of children entering nurseries will still exist. In a certain store in Anshan, out of 400 female employees, an average of 15 take maternity leave every month, which means that 180 female employees give birth to children throughout the year. According to statistics, the Anshan City Commercial System alone needs to build at least 3,000 square meters of nurseries every year to keep up with the number of children increasing every year. Needless to say, the commercial system of just one city requires the state to invest 150,000 yuan to build nurseries every year, which the state cannot afford, and even an increase of 30,000 yuan in nursery expenses every year is unaffordable. If we must do this, it will inevitably seriously affect the state's capital accumulation, and at the same time, an abnormal phenomenon will occur in which the nursery area greatly exceeds the store's business area. Obviously, this method cannot solve the problem at present.

Appropriately controlling fertility is of course the best way to solve this contradiction. However, before family planning has not yet aroused widespread attention and has not yet achieved practical results, we cannot but consider the work arrangements of some female employees who are overburdened with housework. If they continue to work reluctantly, it will be detrimental to both work and family. Among young mothers, it is not uncommon to have two children in three years. According to the calculation of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Commerce, if a female employee has two children in three years, if her maternity leave, personal leave, sick leave (including leave for sick children) and the time affected by pregnancy and breastfeeding are all included, the attendance rate can only reach about 60%. Such a low attendance rate will inevitably affect the improvement of enterprise management and the increase of labor efficiency. Assuming that a store has 300 female salespersons, one-third of the staff has an attendance rate of 60%, another one-third has an attendance rate of 80%, and the remaining one-third has an attendance rate of 100%, in reality, it is only equivalent to the work efficiency of 240 people.

In saying this, it is not to say that our agencies and enterprises should not recruit women to participate in work. Not only did we need women to participate in work in the past, but we need them today, and we will need them in the future. There is no doubt about this. The problem is just that, for some women whose children are born too closely together and too many, who are heavily burdened with housework, and who have no elderly people to help take care of them, and can only do 60% of the work in the enterprise, while the public has to hire a nanny to take care of her children for her (and it is difficult to say that the contribution of a salesperson is more than that of a nanny!), why can't we consider temporarily changing the nature of labor and taking care of the children ourselves? So that the state can reduce the expenditure of a nanny, and let people with higher work efficiency replace their work?

In fact, mothers with more than three children, who have no elderly people to take care of them at home, although they are very strong-willed and able to endure hardship, still have many difficulties. They have to get up before dawn every day, not only to wash their faces, brush their teeth, and eat, but also to dress, wash their faces, and feed each of the children, and it will take even more time to deal with poop and pee. Then they have to send the children to the nursery one by one before they can rush to work in a hurry. There are even more difficulties in windy and snowy weather. After work, they cannot go to bed early, but have to rush to wash clothes, sew and mend, and take care of the children, etc. At night, this child cries, that child cries, and it is simply unimaginable to sleep through the night. Due to overwork and lack of sleep, they become sallow and skinny, the home is messy, and there are frequent errors at work, and as a result, nothing is taken care of properly.

Therefore, instead of this, why can't we consider temporarily putting down the burden of social work and concentrating on taking care of housework and taking good care of the children? Although housework is also very stressful, it generally does not lead to physical collapse due to overwork. And it is also economically worthwhile. Although the woman's wage income is gone, after paying for the childcare fees of several children in the past, there is often little left. At the same time, it was also very wasteful to cook in several places in the past. When managing the household oneself, the money is spent less, and life can be good. Dong Ziju, deputy manager of Liaoning Provincial Department Store, felt many benefits after his wife recently retired to do housework: in the past, when their older children went to school, they often ate instant noodles soaked in boiling water, and sometimes they couldn't even eat this, which made the children's stomachs very bad. Now that his wife has returned home, the whole family can eat hot meals on time, and the children are very happy. In the past, the children were left unattended after returning home, and they ran around outside, and their homework was often graded two or three. Now with the help of their mother to tutor them, the twos have disappeared, and there are not many threes either, and most are fours and fives. In the past, if the socks were torn, there was no time to mend them, so I had to buy new ones. There was no time to wash the clothes, and they were often rotten because they were soaked for a long time in the summer. Now that the mother is at home to mend the socks, she can wear them for two years without buying new ones. If old clothes are mended, there is still a surplus of cloth coupons. Now the children are dressed neatly, and the house is cleaned up, and the home "really looks like a family." In fact, a family without a head of the household will inevitably have a hard time.

However, at present, it is not easy to get some female employees with many children to understand this idea. In some places, as soon as someone mentions mobilizing female employees with many children to engage in housework, they are immediately attacked by the women, who think that this is a great discrimination and insult to women! This requires the full support of public opinion and more publicity and education work so that people can correctly recognize that housework is an indispensable part of social labor, and can consciously take on the responsibility of educating the second generation.

In order to remove the obstacles to mobilizing some female employees with many children to engage in housework, I think two problems need to be solved: Some female employees are unwilling to retire, mainly because they are worried that they will never be able to participate in work again. Based on this situation, can we consider adopting the method of retaining employment status, that is, engaging in housework for a period of time, and when the children are grown up and do not need too much care from their mother, they can continue to participate in work according to the needs of the work. Or, although they have been treated as retired, they can be given priority for employment when there are conditions for work in the future. Second, some people may indeed have difficulties in life after retirement. Can we give them certain subsidies for a certain period of time based on their specific living conditions? In addition, it is also unreasonable that some nurseries currently only charge for the food expenses of the children in nurseries, while the enterprise bears all the childcare fees. This makes some children who have someone to take care of them at home also sent to kindergartens. Therefore, appropriately adjusting a part of the childcare fees to be borne by the employees themselves can not only reduce the state's expenses and the current tension in kindergartens, but also be conducive to the implementation of family planning and mobilizing some female employees with many children to return home to engage in housework.

The above opinions are only a summary of some opinions heard by the reporter in the interviews in some units with more female employees. The views may be one-sided, immature, and not comprehensive, but we believe that this is indeed a question worth raising for discussion.

    工作和家务无法兼顾怎么办
    本报记者　金雨困
    辽宁省商业厅有一位负责同志，不久前从鞍山、大连检查工作回来，和记者谈起他听到的两件事情：
    在大连时，曾有人为天津街百货商店一位女营业员算了一笔账。这位女营业员是一位四个孩子的妈妈。妈妈要工作，孩子就必须有人照顾。因此她的两个较大的孩子就送进了幼儿园（全托），这样企业就得每月给她付出保育费四十五元（目前这里一般托儿所职工仅负担孩子的伙食费，每个孩子每月需公家补助二、三十元之多），另外两个较小的送在哺乳室（日托），企业每月也得给贴补二十五元。这样公家一共给她的补贴是七十多元。而她本人的全部基本工资是四十多元。仅这一笔附加工资（还不包括其它）就比她的基本工资多很多。
    旅大市商业局所属的幼儿园有一个保育员，她已有四个孩子，三个在院里全托，一个是日托。依照旅大一般保育员的看四个到五个孩子的定额，这样就等于国家给了她工资，而她仅完成了看自己的孩子的任务。这个局的一位局长开玩笑地说：再过几年，我们幼儿园里的保育员不用都生四个孩子，只要都生到三个孩子的时候，那时幼儿园就只能收容保育员的孩子了！
    这两个例子，一方面是说明了在我们国家里，为了使妇女能和男子同样参加国家的政治生活，和参加她们力所能及的各种劳动，国家尽了一切可能花了很多钱来为她们创造工作条件。这在旧社会是不可想像的事情。同时另一方面也反映了这样一个问题：虽然给多子女职工适当的照顾是必要的，但是目前的问题是国家在这方面的负担确是过重了，特别是与国家当前的经济状况及她本人的劳动贡献来比较，就显得不相称也很不合理。因此值得考虑的是：对一部分孩子多的女职工，当她们生活和生理条件已起了很大变化，工作和家务已很难兼顾的情况下，是继续增加国家负担，仍然在企业工作下去，对国家和个人更有利呢？还是暂时改变劳动性质，从事适于她本人条件的劳动，对国家和个人更有利呢？
    但是有的女同志却不这样考虑，她们认为要解决这个矛盾，主要应该靠国家大量投资来继续迅速发展托儿事业。我们认为，这不仅是目前条件所不能做到的，而且也是不应该这样做的。据商业部门在鞍山、大连两地的检查，认为目前托儿所不是办得少了，而是办得不少，国家在这方面的负担不是轻了，而是太重。在那些地方，几乎每一个商店后边都有一个托儿所。为了托儿所的问题，商店经理的精力已很受影响。鞍山市商业系统有四十九个托儿所，建筑面积共五千多平方公尺，已比鞍山最大的大型商店——有千余职工、营业面积三千多平方公尺的青年商店还要大。但是与实际的需要距离还很远。据调查，要充分满足需要，还得增加现有托儿所面积一倍以上。而且就是这样增加了，现有的小孩入托的问题解决了，明年小孩还要继续生出来，小儿入托问题还会存在。鞍山某商店四百女职工，平均每月有十五名请产假，全年即有一百八十名女职工生孩子。据统计，仅鞍山市商业系统，每年至少需要建筑三千平方公尺的托儿所，才能赶上每年增加小孩的数字。不用说，仅仅一个市的商业系统，每年就要国家投资十五万元建筑托儿所，国家负担不了，就是每年增加三万元托儿所的开支，也是无法负担的。假如一定要这样做的话，势必使国家的资金积累受到严重影响，同时也会发生托儿所面积大大超过商店营业面积的不正常现象。显然，用这个办法在目前是无法解决问题的。
    适当地节制生育，当然是解决这一矛盾的最好办法。但是在目前节育尚未引起普遍重视，而且还未取得实际效果以前，这就不能不考虑部分家务负担过重的女职工的工作安排问题。如果继续勉强工作下去，这对工作和家庭都是不利的。在年青的妈妈中，目前三年生两个孩子的并不是个别的。据辽宁省商业厅的计算，如果一个女职工三年生两个孩子的话，把她的产假、事假、病假（包括孩子生病请假）和怀孕、喂奶影响的时间都计算在内，出勤率只能达到60％上下。出勤率这么低，这对改进企业的经营和提高劳动效率必然是会有影响的。假定一个商店有三百名女营业员，三分之一的人员出勤率是60％，另外三分之一是80％，其余三分之一是百分之百的话，实际上只等于二百四十人的工作效率。
    这样说，并不是说我们的机关和企业就不应吸收妇女参加工作。不仅过去需要妇女参加工作，今天需要，将来还是需要，这是无可怀疑的。问题只是说，在一部分子女生育过密过多，家务负担很重，又无老人可以帮忙照顾，在企业里只能做60％的工作，而公家还得为她请一个保育员替她看孩子（而且一个营业员的贡献，很难说比一个保育员更多！），为什么不可以考虑暂时改变劳动性质，自己去看孩子呢？使国家减少一个保育员的开支，并让工作效率更高的人代替自己的工作呢？
    事实上，有三个孩子以上的妈妈，家里又无老人照顾，尽管自己很要强，能够刻苦耐劳，但是困难还是很多的。每天天不亮就得起床，不仅自己要洗脸、漱口、吃饭，而且还要为孩子一个个穿衣、洗脸、吃饭，赶上拉屎撒尿就更要耽误时间。然后把孩子一个个送进托儿所，自己才能匆忙地赶去上班。遇到风雪天困难就更多。下班以后还不能早睡，要赶着洗衣服，缝缝补补，照顾孩子等。晚上这个孩子叫，那个孩子哭，想一觉睡到大天亮，简直是不敢想像的事情。由于操劳过度，睡眠不足，把自己弄得脸黄肌瘦，家里又弄得乱七八糟，工作还要经常出差错，结果什么都没有管好。
    因此，与其这样，为什么不可以考虑暂时放下社会工作的担子，集中精力去料理家务、照顾好孩子呢？家务劳动虽然也很紧张，但一般还不致因劳累过度把身体搞垮。而且在经济上也还是合算的。虽然女方的工资收入没有了，但是过去她收入的工资，除了付出几个孩子的托儿费后，往往也就所剩无几了。同时过去一家几处开伙浪费也很大。自己管家，钱花得少，日子又能过得好。辽宁省百货公司副经理董滋九的爱人最近退职从事家务劳动后，就感到好处很多：过去他们的大孩子上学时，常常是用开水泡饭吃，有时连这也吃不上，弄得孩子的胃很不好。现在爱人回到家里后，全家都能按时吃上热饭，孩子们很高兴。过去孩子回来后没人管，就在外边乱跑，功课常常是二分三分。现在有了妈妈帮助辅导，二分的消灭了，三分的也不多了，大部都是四分和五分。过去袜子破了没有时间补，只好买新的穿。衣服没有时间洗，夏天还因衣服泡的时间久都泡烂了。现在妈妈在家把袜子一补，可穿二年不用买新的。旧衣补补穿，布票还有多余。现在孩子穿得很整齐，家里也收拾得很干净，家就“真像个家庭样了”。事实上，一个家庭没有一个当家人，日子必然是很难过好的。
    但是，目前要使一部分多子女的女职工搞通思想，还不是很容易的事情。有的地方有人一提动员多子女的女职工从事家务劳动，马上遭到了女同志们的群起而攻之，认为这是对妇女莫大的歧视和侮辱！这就需要社会舆论的充分支持，进行更多的宣传教育工作，使人们能够正确认识家务劳动是社会劳动不可少的一部分，才能自觉地把教育第二代的责任担当起来。
    为了解除动员部分孩子多的女职工从事家务劳动的障碍，我认为需要解决两个问题：有些女职工所以不愿意退职，主要是顾虑今后再也无法参加工作。根据这一情况，是否可考虑采取保留工籍的办法，即在一段时期内去从事家务劳动，等把孩子养大了，不需妈妈过多照顾时，可以根据工作需要继续参加工作。或是虽已作了退职处理，但将来有条件工作时可予以优先录用的机会。第二，有些人退职后生活确实可能发生困难，是否可以根据具体生活情况在一定时期内给予一定的补助。此外，目前一些托儿所只收入托儿童的伙食费，而保育费等全由企业负担，也是不够合理的。这样就使一些在家有人看的孩子，也都送进了幼儿园。因此适当调整一部分保育费由职工本人负担，这样既可减轻国家开支和当前托儿所的紧张状况，同时也会有利于实行节育和动员部分孩子多的女职工回家从事家务劳动。
    以上这些意见，仅是记者在采访中，在某些女职工较多的单位听到的一些意见的综合，看法可能有片面和不成熟、不周到之处，但是我们认为这确是值得提出来商榷的问题。
