Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: According to TASS reports, Soviet scientists and engineers, in interviews published in the Soviet "Industrial Economics Newspaper" on the 19th, envisioned some technological innovations that would appear in the Soviet national economy in the near future.

Academician Barkin believes that the metallurgical industry in the Soviet Union will undergo fundamental changes in the near future. It will be entirely possible to obtain pure iron or standard steel directly from ore deposits and immediately produce finished products such as steel rails, channel steel, and I-beams. This new type of equipment can be simply envisioned as a large rotary drum. At one end of the rotary drum, very pure ore powder, that is, metal oxides without any impurities, is continuously supplied; at the other end, a gaseous reducing agent, such as hydrogen, is supplied. The pure metal powder obtained in this way can be immediately sent for casting or pressed into the required products.

Barkin also said that experiments have shown that in the near future, a completely new form of metal processing will appear, that is, irradiating steel with neutron beams to improve the mechanical properties of the steel (such as quenching, annealing, etc.). This new type of equipment will be designed and manufactured in the near future.

This Soviet scientist predicted that a new industrial sector will emerge in the future - the radiation metallurgy industry, which can turn lead into gold. Obtaining rare chemical elements from widely distributed metals will become as common as obtaining metals from ores is now.

Soviet scientist Gudenmacher believes that there is now a realistic prospect of creating a "remote-controlled library" machine that utilizes the so-called electronic "machine memory" principle. This "remote-controlled library" can allow many readers to directly use its "book repository" from their homes or offices simultaneously. In the future, the "reader" only needs to dial the title of the book on a special keyboard, and almost instantaneously, they can see the content of the book on a television screen or hear its content. Dr. Gudenmacher believes that in addition to a large amount of "memory," this machine will also have corresponding "answer" devices. It can indirectly answer questions based on the information accumulated in the "machine memory." The use of these electronic machines by people will fundamentally change all forms of intellectual labor and allow everyone to utilize all the knowledge accumulated by mankind in science and technology.

Soviet physics and mathematics expert Zabotinsky, in discussing the new achievements of quantum radio technology in the future, said that by using molecular oscillators and amplifiers on many artificial satellites orbiting along different paths, complex research can be conducted on the universe, and the research results can be sent back to Earth. Molecular oscillators will help to successfully solve tasks such as checking the general theory of relativity, studying the imbalance of the Earth's rotation, and formulating extremely precise atomic standards. Quantum radio technology will contribute to exploring many secrets of the interaction of forces inside molecules, atoms, and atomic nuclei. Discovering these secrets will allow for more effective control of chemical processes and the creation of substances with new and excellent properties. Radiation spectra with wavelengths of a few tenths of a millimeter or a few hundredths of a millimeter can potentially determine whether substances that exist in quantities of only one part per billion exist. He also believes that a new scientific sector will emerge - direct television. At night or in fog, the image obtained by this television will be much clearer than the image on a radar screen.

Soviet engineers Garkusha and Fedorov mentioned in their article that in the future, it may be possible to adopt the method of drilling horizontal wells instead of vertical wells to achieve underground coal gasification of coal seams. They believe that it is possible in the future to drill wells using ultrasound or high-frequency current. Using this method, a trench in the underground coal seam can be "burned out" directly from the ground.

    苏联科学家谈技术革新前景
    矿床出钢材  点铅成黄金  机器解疑难　钻井用声音
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学家和工程师在19日苏联“工业经济报”发表的谈话中展望了不久的将来将在苏联国民经济中出现的一些技术革新的情况。
    巴尔金院士认为，不久的将来，苏联的冶金工业将出现根本的变化。将来完全有可能从矿床里直接获得纯铁或者合乎规格的钢，而且立即能够生产出钢轨、槽钢和工字钢等成品。这种新型设备，可以简单设想为一个大旋转筒。旋转筒的一端源源供应很纯的矿石粉，即没有任何杂质的金属氧化物；另一端供应气体还原剂，例如，氢。这样得到的粉状纯金属就可以立即送去熔铸或者压成必需的制品。
    巴尔金还说，试验的结果表明，不久的将来，就可以出现一种完全新的金属加工形式，即用中子流照射钢，来提高钢的机械性能（如淬火、退火等）。这种新型设备在最近即将设计和制造。
    这位苏联科学家预言，未来将出现新的工业部门——辐射冶金工业，这一工业部门可以把铅变成金子。从分布很广的金属中获得稀有化学元素的事情，将像现在从矿石中获得金属一样，成为习见的现象。
    苏联科学家古登马赫尔认为，现在已有现实的前景，可以创造一种利用所谓电子“机器记忆”原理的“遥控图书馆”的机器。这种“遥控图书馆”可以使许多读者同时从家里或机关里直接使用它的“书库”。未来的“读者”只要在特别的键盘上拨叫书名，几乎一瞬间，就可以在电视银幕上看到这本书的内容或是听到它的内容。古登马赫尔博士认为，这种机器除了大量“记忆”外，还将有相应的“解答”装置。它能在“机器记忆”所积累的情报基础上间接地解答问题。人们利用这些电子机器，将使各种形式的智力劳动发生根本变化，并且可以使每一个人都能利用人类在科学技术方面所积累的一切知识。
    苏联物理数学专家扎伯丁斯基在谈到将来的量子无线电技术的新成就时说，利用沿着不同轨道运行的许多人造卫星上的分子震荡器和放大器，可以对宇宙进行复杂的研究，并把研究结果发回地球。分子震荡器将有助于成功地解决检查广义相对论、研究地球旋转的不均衡性，制定各项极度精确的原子标准等任务。量子无线电技术将对探索分子内部、原子和原子核的力的互相作用的许多秘密作出贡献，发现了这些秘密，就可以更加有效地控制化学过程和制造有新的优良特性的物质。波长为数十分之一公厘或数百分之一公厘的放射光谱有可能确定那些数量只有十亿分之一克的物质是否存在。他还认为，将会产生一种新的科学部门——直接电视。在夜间或在雾中，这种电视机得到的形象要比雷达幕上的形象清楚得多。
    苏联工程师加尔库沙和费多罗夫在文章中谈到，将来可能采取钻横井而不钻竖井的方法使煤层地下煤气化。他们认为，将来用超声波或用高频率电流来钻井是可能的，用这种方法可以直接从地面“烧出”一条地下煤层的沟来。
