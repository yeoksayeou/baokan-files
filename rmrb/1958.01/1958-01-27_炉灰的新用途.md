    New Uses for Furnace Ash
    The steam boiler workshop of the Northeast Petroleum Seventh Factory consumes hundreds of tons of bituminous coal and produces more than ten tons of furnace ash every day. This furnace ash has always been used only for filling the sea, paving roads, and filling potholes.
    Recently, based on the suggestion of Zhang Wenke, an insulation worker in the maintenance workshop, adding 30% furnace ash to the insulation ash for insulating oil pipelines, the effect is only 0.5 degrees Celsius worse than pure insulation ash, which is perfectly applicable.
    After adopting this method, the factory can save more than 200 tons of insulation ash annually, worth more than 36,000 yuan. (Liu Baohai, Tao Jiaju)

    炉灰的新用途
    东北石油七厂的蒸汽锅炉车间，每天吞入几百吨的烟煤，吐出十几吨的炉灰。这些炉灰从来就是只能用去填海、铺道、垫坑的。
    最近，这个厂根据保修车间保温工张文科的建议，在保温灰内加30％炉灰给输油管保温，效果比纯保温灰只差摄氏0.5度，完全可以适用。
    这个厂采用这个办法后，全年可以节约二百多吨保温灰，约值人民币三万六千多元。　（刘宝海、陶家聚）
