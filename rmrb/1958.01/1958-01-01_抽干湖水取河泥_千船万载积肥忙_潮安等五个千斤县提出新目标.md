Draining Lake Water to Collect River Mud: Thousands of Boats and Tens of Thousands of Loads Busy Accumulating Fertilizer
Chao'an and Five Other Thousand-Jin Counties Set New Goals

(Reported by this newspaper) The five thousand-jin counties in the Chao-Shan Plain of Guangdong Province, namely Chao'an, Chenghai, Jieyang, Puning, and Chaoyang, have recently set new goals. In 1958, Chao'an plans to achieve an average grain yield of 1,420 jin per mu, an increase of 18% compared to 1957; Chenghai aims for 1,378 jin per mu, Jieyang for 1,300 jin per mu, Puning for 1,216 jin per mu, and Chaoyang for 1,262 jin per mu. Among these five counties, except for Jieyang and Chaoyang, the other three counties have basically or preliminarily eliminated drought. Currently, apart from some areas that are still persisting in large-scale water conservancy projects, all counties are fully organizing farmers to engage in fertilizer accumulation activities based on their local characteristics. The conservative and backward thinking that "there is no fertilizer source in the plains" and "fertilizer accumulation has reached its limits" is being shattered by the great scene of "thousands of boats and tens of thousands of loads." At present, on the Han River, Rong River, Lian River, and various large-scale irrigation canals, boats accumulating fertilizer shuttle back and forth, end to end. Thousands of waterwheels are creaking day and night by the ponds and ditches, and countless ponds and ditches have been drained, their fertile mud being carried away. In the fields, there are endless teams carrying fertilizer everywhere, and in many places, groups of people lighting fires to accumulate fertilizer can be seen at night. According to statistics from relevant leading departments, the number of people mobilized for fertilizer accumulation in these five counties exceeds 500,000 every day. Since the beginning of winter, the five counties have accumulated a total of 93.81 million dan, which averages more than 50 dan per mu, calculated over 1.75 million mu of paddy fields. The counties have also acted in accordance with unified planning, with villages acting jointly, and have drained many large lakes and streams that could not be drained in previous years, extracting hundreds of thousands or even millions of dan of fertilizer. Eleven villages in Chao'an County acted jointly and drained Chaozhou City's West Lake, which had not been exposed in fifty or sixty years, estimating that it could accumulate 2 million dan of fertilizer. The county is now cutting off five large irrigation canals to dry them and collect mud. Chao'an, Chenghai, Jieyang, and Chaoyang counties are also preparing to jointly drain the lake in Zhongshan Park in Shantou City after New Year's Day, estimating that they can accumulate no less than several million dan of fertilizer.

    抽干湖水取河泥　千船万载积肥忙
    潮安等五个千斤县提出新目标
    本报讯　广东省潮汕平原潮安、澄海、揭阳、普宁、潮阳等五个千斤县，最近又制定了新的奋斗目标。1958年，潮安计划平均亩产粮一千四百二十斤，比1957年增产18％，澄海亩产一千三百七十八斤，揭阳亩产一千三百斤，普宁亩产一千二百一十六斤，潮阳亩产一千二百六十二斤。这五个县，除揭阳、潮阳两县以外，其余三县已经基本上或初步消灭旱灾。现在各县除一部分地区仍然坚持大兴水利而外，都在根据当地特点，全力组织农民投入积肥运动。“平原无肥源”、“积肥已到山穷水尽”的保守落后思想，正在为“千船万载”的伟大积肥场面所粉碎。目前，在韩江、榕江、练江和各个大水利灌溉渠上，积肥的船只来往如梭，首尾相接。千百架水车在塘边、沟边日夜轧轧作响，无数池塘、沟渠被车干了，它们的肥泥被挑了起来。在田野上，到处都有一眼望不见尽头的挑肥队伍，不少地方在夜间还可看见点火积肥的人群。据有关领导部门的统计，这五个县每天出动积肥的人数在五十万以上。入冬以来，五县共已积集九千三百八十一万担，按一百七十五万亩水田拉平计算，每亩已达五十多担。各县还按照统一规划，各乡联合行动，把许多历年无法车干水的大湖、大溪也车干，取出了数十万以至数百万担肥。潮安县十一个乡联合行动，车干了五、六十年来没有露底的潮州市西湖，估计可以积肥二百万担。这个县现正把五个大灌溉渠拦腰截断，干水取泥。潮安、澄海、揭阳、潮阳四个县还准备在元旦后联合行动，车干汕头市中山公园的湖水，估计积肥也不下数百万担。
