Fudan University's Sanitation Blitz Day

In Shanghai's Patriotic Health Campaign, Fudan University's faculty and students are also actively participating. On one Sunday, over six thousand faculty and staff members across the university, led by the vice president and the Party Secretary, took action with a blitz spirit. Many white-haired professors in their sixties and seventies enthusiastically joined the "eliminate the four pests" commando team. Guo Shaoyu, a seventy-year-old professor from the Chinese Department, also helped young men clean the classroom building with great energy.

On this day, from early morning, Fudan's beautiful campus resounded with joyful labor songs. The more than six thousand people across the university were divided into twelve areas, and after a full day of intense labor, the entire university was cleaned and tidied up. Everyone cleared more than two tons of garbage and weeds, and also blocked many rat holes, emptied a lot of sparrow nests, and filled in the low-lying areas and sewage ditches in the school. The flies and mosquitoes hiding in the dining hall and library for the winter were also basically annihilated. They also helped residents clean several main streets near the school. The slogan proposed by everyone was "To make Fudan a school free of the four pests!"

    复旦大学卫生突击日
    上海市爱国卫生运动中，复旦大学师生也积极投入运动。一个星期日，全校教职员工六千余人在副校长和党委书记等领导同志的带动下，都以突击的姿态动起手来。很多鬓发斑白的六、七十岁老教授，都热情地参加除四害突击队。七十多岁的中文系郭绍虞老教授，也精神抖擞地帮助年轻小伙子打扫教室大楼。
    这一天，从清晨起，复旦美丽的校园内就响彻着欢乐的劳动歌声。全校六千多人分成十二个地区，经过全日紧张的劳动，把全校打扫得焕然一新，整理得井井有序。大家共清除垃圾和杂草两吨多，而且还堵死了很多鼠洞，掏了不少麻雀窝，填平校中的低地和污水沟，躲藏在饭厅和图书馆过冬的苍蝇与蚊子也基本上被歼灭。他们还帮助居民清扫了学校附近的几条主要街道。大家提出的口号是“要使复旦成为四无学校”
