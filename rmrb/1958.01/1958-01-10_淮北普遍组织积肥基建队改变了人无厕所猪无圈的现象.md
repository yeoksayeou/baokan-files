Xinhua News Agency report: Huaibei region, Anhui province, is using the method of universally organizing manure collection and infrastructure teams to change the long-standing situation of "people without toilets, pigs without pens."

The region has now organized over 72,000 manure collection and infrastructure teams, with over 480,000 members participating. In the past two months, they have built 1.66 million toilets, 980,000 pig pens, and also built 1.1 million manure pits and many ash houses. In the Bengbu region, 90% of farm households have built toilets, and 80% of the pigs have pens. It is expected that by the Spring Festival, they will be able to achieve "people having toilets and pigs having pens."

In the Huaibei region, building toilets, pens for pigs, and collecting manure has a significant impact on changing the region's habit of extensive planting and low yields, and increasing the yield per unit area of crops. If human and animal manure is fully utilized, it can solve the fertilizer problem for more than 60% of the cultivated land in the region.

The disaster-prone Huaibei region has historically lacked the habit of building toilets, pens for pigs, and collecting manure, and agricultural cooperatives have not had anyone specifically responsible for this. It was not until last autumn, when the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the establishment of manure collection and infrastructure teams to achieve "people having toilets and pigs having pens," that the situation quickly changed. The manure collection and infrastructure teams are organized by the cooperative or production team, and are composed of masons, carpenters, and members with manure collection experience. They help members build toilets, repair pig pens, and make ash houses; they help production teams dig manure pits. The cooperative adopted the "four guarantees" method for the infrastructure teams: guaranteeing tasks, guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing work points, and guaranteeing time, and paid by the piece, with dividends distributed in the same year. In order to take care of the difficulties of the members, the cost of materials for building toilets is paid from the agricultural cooperative's public accumulation fund, and the materials for repairing pig pens are prepared by the members themselves.

### 淮北普遍组织积肥基建队改变了人无厕所猪无圈的现象

    淮北普遍组织积肥基建队改变了人无厕所猪无圈的现象
    新华社讯　安徽省淮北地区用普遍组织积肥基建队的办法，改变了向来“人无厕所猪无圈”的现象。
    这个地区目前已组织起了七万二千多个积肥基建队，参加的社员有四十八万多人。他们在最近两个多月来，共修建厕所一百六十六万个，猪圈九十八万个，还修建了一百一十万个粪池和很多灰屋。蚌埠专区90％的农户都已经修起厕所，80％的猪有了圈，预计在春节以前就可以做到“人有厕所猪有圈”。
    淮北地区修建厕所、圈猪积肥，对于改变这个地区广种薄收习惯，增加农作物单位面积产量有重大的作用。如果把人畜粪充分利用起来，就可以解决这个地区60％以上耕地的肥料问题。
    多灾的淮北地区，群众历来没有修建厕所、圈猪积肥的习惯，农业社也没有专人负责这方面的事。直到去年秋天，中共安徽省委指示采用建立积肥基建队的办法，做到“人有厕所猪有圈”，情况才很快改变。积肥基建队是以社或生产队为单位，吸收泥水匠、木匠和有积肥经验的社员组成，他们帮助社员盖厕所，修猪圈，做灰屋；帮助生产队挖粪坑。社里对基建队采取了包任务、包质量、包工分、包时间的四包办法，按件计工，当年分红。为了照顾社员的困难，盖厕所的材料费由农业社公积金中开支，修猪圈材料由社员自备。
