    Compete in Enthusiasm, Compete in Advancement
    Jing Yu
    On January 3rd, this newspaper published an article by Comrade Wang Pu on page three, reviewing the example of the Industrial and Transportation Department of the CCP Zhejiang Jiande Prefectural Committee and the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Tonglu County Committee, which promoted production development through the comparison of advanced and backward practices. Today, this newspaper also reports that the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, when formulating its 1958 production plan, sought advanced indicators from the national locomotive and rolling stock repair factories, determined to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced level. This approach of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is of great significance for improving leadership effectiveness and promoting production progress, and it is also worthy of being promoted.
    The fundamental purpose of revolution is to liberate the productive forces and develop production. Under the socialist system, the leadership consciously promoting production development through the comparison of advanced and backward practices is the best leadership method. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his congratulatory message to the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives in 1956: "Production is always in a state of development and change, and new production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies. Therefore, in any era and in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who adopt relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their technology and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the whole society, and social production is improved." It has been more than a year since Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instruction, and today, rereading this instruction, how fresh it still is!
    The difference between advanced and backward is always present. The responsibility of production leaders lies in how to analyze this difference, and to try every means to continuously narrow this difference, continuously eliminate this difference, and promote production forward. Generally speaking, the production indicators of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory are not advanced. For example, the cost of locomotive overhaul: the Mudanjiang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory only needs 21,000 yuan for each overhaul, while the Changxindian Factory costs 28,000 yuan; another example is the number of days a locomotive stays in the factory: the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory only needs 14.8 days, while the Changxindian Factory needs 16.8 days. Of course, there are also factories that take longer than the Changxindian Factory, such as the Taiyuan, Jinan, and Zhuzhou repair factories, which all take more than 24 days. Due to the different construction histories, technical equipment, line conditions, and locomotive damage conditions of each factory, it is impossible to require complete uniformity. However, how to reduce costs and reduce the time locomotives are in the factory is completely possible to improve through effort. The leading personnel of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory are able to humbly study the situation of brother factories, find out the advanced things, and dare to put forward the slogan of catching up with the advanced. This spirit and boldness are worth learning. We hope that production leaders can base themselves on their own factories and face the whole province and the whole country, constantly study the advanced indicators and advanced experiences of brother factories and mines, and catch up with them.
    Now, the socialist revolutionary enthusiasm on the economic front is thriving. We advocate that all production enterprises put forward comparable indicators of the same nature, put them in front of the workers, so that everyone can see: Who has more enthusiasm? Who is more advanced? Who is lagging behind? Then mobilize everyone to be determined to catch up with the advanced level. In this way, our industrial production can continuously develop.
    Let us all compete in enthusiasm and compete in advancement, and build our country into an advanced socialist power as soon as possible.

    比干劲比先进
    静宇
    1月3日本报三版曾发表了王朴同志的文章，评述中共浙江建德地委工业交通部和桐庐县委工业交通部，通过先进与落后的对比促进生产发展的范例。今天，本报又报道了长辛店机车车辆修理厂在制订1958年生产计划的时候，从全国机车车辆修理厂的指标中，寻找先进的指标，决心向先进者看齐，赶上先进水平。长辛店机车车辆修理厂的这种做法，对于提高领导效能、推动生产前进有着十分重要的意义，也值得推而广之。
    革命的根本目的是解放生产力、发展生产。在社会主义制度下，领导上有意识地通过先进与落后的对比来促进生产的发展，是最好的领导方法。刘少奇同志在1956年对全国先进生产者代表会议的祝词中指出：“生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。”刘少奇同志的指示已经一年多了，今天，重读这个指示，还是多么的新鲜啊？！
    先进与落后的差别是经常存在的。生产领导者的责任就在于如何分析这个差别，并且想尽一切办法不断地缩小这个差别，不断地消灭这个差别，推动生产前进。长辛店机车车辆修理厂的生产指标总的说来，并不是先进的，譬如说机车大修成本，牡丹江机车车辆厂每大修一台只要二万一千元，而长辛店厂要花费二万八千元；又如机车在厂天数，戚墅堰机车车辆修理厂只要十四点八天，而长辛店厂却要十六点八天。当然，也有比长辛店厂费时更多的，如太原、济南、株洲等修理厂都在二十四天以上。由于各厂的建厂历史，技术配备以及线路情况不同与机车损害情况不同，要求完全一模一样是不可能的，然而，如何降低成本，减少机车停厂时间，则是完全可以努力改进的。长辛店机车车辆修理厂的领导人员能够虚心地研究兄弟厂的情况，找出先进的东西，并且勇于提出赶上先进的口号，这种精神和气魄是值得学习的。我们希望生产领导者都能立脚本厂，面向全省全国。经常地研究兄弟厂矿的先进指标和先进经验，迎头赶上。
    现在，经济战线上的社会主义革命干劲蒸蒸日上，我们主张一切生产企业把相同性质的可比指标摆出来，摆在职工群众的面前，让大家看看：哪个干劲大？哪个先进？哪个落后？然后发动大家下决心赶上先进的水平。这样我们的工业生产就能不断地发展。
    让我们大家都来比干劲比先进，把我们的国家尽速地建成为一个先进的社会主义强国。
