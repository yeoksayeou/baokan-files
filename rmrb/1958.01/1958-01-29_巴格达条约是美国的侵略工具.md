The fourth meeting of the Baghdad Pact Organization Council is being held in Ankara. Although the United States is not a formal member of this group, it has sent Dulles to lead an "observer group" to participate in the meeting. This shows that the United States has moved from behind the scenes to the front, directly manipulating this aggressive bloc. However, U.S. officials are still trying to cover this up, deliberately emphasizing that "the United States currently does not intend to join the Baghdad Pact," as if the United States has no close relationship with the Baghdad Pact.

This concealment by the United States is useless. Everyone knows that the Baghdad Pact was originally a product of the U.S. policy of colonial aggression in the Near and Middle East. As in other parts of the world, the United States has always regarded the organization of military blocs as an important means for carrying out colonial aggression in the Near and Middle East. The entire process of the Baghdad Pact's creation can prove this.

As early as 1951, when Iran launched a vigorous oil nationalization movement and it was having a widespread impact in various countries in the Near and Middle East, the United States colluded with Britain, France, and Turkey to propose the organization of a so-called "Middle East Joint Command" to countries in the Near and Middle East, demanding that these countries hand over their armies, bases, communications equipment, ports, etc., to this "command" for management and command. This blatant plan of aggression was resolutely opposed by the people of the Near and Middle East countries and failed. In August 1952, the United States put forward a modified plan alone, demanding that the countries of the Near and Middle East establish a so-called "Middle East Defense Organization." This plan met the same fate as the first one. In May 1953, Dulles personally went to the Near and Middle East for a so-called "inspection" tour. Shortly after returning home, he proposed a so-called "Northern Tier Defense Organization" plan, which was expected to be participated in by Turkey, Pakistan, Iraq, and Iran. This was the prototype of the Baghdad Pact group that was later established.

In the spring of 1954, the United States began to piece together the Baghdad Pact. Under the direction of the United States, Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Pakistan, a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, first signed a so-called military and economic cooperation agreement. In February 1955, Turkey and Iraq signed the so-called "Mutual Cooperation Treaty," which is the "Baghdad Pact." Pakistan and Iran joined the treaty in September and October respectively.

Britain is also one of the planners of the Baghdad Pact. This old colonial country also attempted to use the method of organizing military blocs and "divide and rule" to maintain its colonial position in the Near and Middle East. Moreover, in order to prevent being squeezed out by the United States, Britain hurriedly joined the Baghdad Pact as soon as it was established. In this way, the struggle for leadership between the two colonial powers, the United States and Britain, inevitably occurred within the Baghdad Pact group.

The reason why the United States allowed Britain to participate but did not participate in the Baghdad Pact group itself was for its own considerations. The United States saw that the sentiment of the Arab people against Western military blocs was growing stronger, so it preferred to let Britain come forward to put together and expand the Baghdad Pact, thereby bearing the risk of Arab people's resistance. The United States thought that this would conceal its colonial and aggressive face in front of the Arab people on the one hand; on the other hand, if Britain expanded the treaty, its own strength would definitely not be able to bear it and it would still require help from the United States.

In this way, the United States chose a role as a backstage manipulator for itself. It controls the economic, diplomatic, and military activities of these countries through bilateral military agreements signed with the four Near and Middle Eastern countries of this group, through a network of military bases and military advisory groups. In addition, although the United States is nominally not a member of the Baghdad Pact group, it has long participated in the "Anti-Subversion Committee" and the "Economic Committee" of this treaty organization. After the Suez War, Britain's influence in the Near and Middle East was severely weakened, and the United States further participated in the "Military Committee" and served as the permanent Deputy Chief of Staff of the group's Joint Chiefs of Staff. So far, the United States has controlled all the activities of this group and has become the actual leader of this group.

For more than two years, the United States has used the Baghdad Pact group to carry out a series of aggressive activities in the Near and Middle East, seriously threatening the independence and peace of the Near and Middle Eastern countries.

First, the United States forced the four Near and Middle Eastern countries participating in the Baghdad Pact group to embark on the path of arms expansion and war preparation. Turkey has become the largest barracks and arsenal of the United States in the Near and Middle East. Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan have also rapidly embarked on the road to militarization. The U.S. large-scale arming of the Baghdad Pact countries has, on the one hand, made the people of these countries bear a heavy burden, and the financial and economic crisis has deepened; on the other hand, it has also created mutual opposition between the Near and Middle Eastern countries, making the situation in the Near and Middle East often in a state of tension.

Second, the United States has used the armies and bases of the Baghdad Pact group countries to continuously carry out military threats against the Near and Middle Eastern countries that pursue a policy of peace and independence, vainly attempting to force these countries to abandon national sovereignty and accept the U.S. policy of aggression. In particular, Turkey's military force has become a tool constantly used by the United States. Shortly after the establishment of the Baghdad Pact group, the United States instructed Turkey to assemble troops on the Turkish-Syrian border, coercing Syria to join the Baghdad Pact. Since then, whenever the national independence movement in the Near and Middle East is surging, Turkey has invariably created tension on the Turkish-Syrian border. The U.S. decision to join the Baghdad Pact's "Military Committee" in June last year further strengthened military control over this group. At the same time, the United States conspired with Turkey to carry out a major conspiracy to invade Syria, attempting to ignite dangerous flames of war in the Near and Middle East. This conspiracy was defeated by the Syrian people and the world's peaceful forces; but it most clearly exposed the seriousness of the United States using the Baghdad Pact group countries to carry out adventures.

The United States also uses the Baghdad Pact to interfere in the internal affairs of Near and Middle Eastern countries and carry out subversive activities within these countries. The Baghdad Pact's "Anti-Subversion Committee," in which the United States participates, is essentially a command organization for carrying out subversive activities against the nationally independent countries of the Near and Middle East. In June last year, the "Anti-Subversion Committee" notified its member states that the committee's activities should not only target socialist countries, but also neutral countries such as India, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Syria. Some representatives of the Baghdad Pact countries openly stated that "neutralism is the biggest enemy of the Baghdad Pact." Shortly after the meeting, Syria uncovered a large-scale subversion case directly led by personnel from the U.S. Embassy.

All of the above facts prove that the Baghdad Pact group is an important tool for the United States to carry out frenzied aggressive activities in the Near and Middle East. Its purpose is to turn the Near and Middle East into a hotbed of new wars and a colonial sphere of influence of the United States, so that U.S. monopoly capitalist groups can plunder the rich resources of this region at will. For this reason, the Arab people regard the struggle against the Baghdad Pact group as an important struggle to safeguard national independence and peace in the Near and Middle East. The Baghdad Pact, like the "Eisenhower Doctrine," has become the target of public criticism in the Near and Middle East, and since the day it appeared, it has been met with increasingly strong opposition from the people of the Near and Middle East. Now, noteworthy changes are also taking place within some Baghdad Pact countries. Some of the U.S. aggressive activities have caused unease among some Baghdad Pact member states and have not been supported by these countries. These situations indicate that this group has been paralyzed.

However, the United States is not reconciled to its failure. Dulles' personal attendance at the Ankara meeting this time is aimed at boosting the morale of this group, further controlling this group, and using it to intensify arms expansion and war preparation activities to threaten peace in the Near and Middle East.

On January 21, TASS was authorized to issue a statement, forcefully exposing the U.S. activities of threatening peace by using the Ankara meeting, and proposed to turn the Near and Middle East into a nuclear-free zone. This statement has been valued and welcomed by the people of various countries in the Near and Middle East. They are fighting against the conspiracy of the Ankara meeting and for safeguarding peace in the Near and Middle East. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has condemned the Baghdad Pact group and the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which is the common will of the 1.7 billion people of Asia and Africa. If the United States goes its own way recklessly, it will be the one who suffers.

    巴格达条约是美国的侵略工具
    邢象超
    巴格达条约集团理事会第四次会议正在安卡拉举行。美国虽然不是这个集团的正式成员国，但却派遣了杜勒斯率领“观察团”参加这次会议。这表明美国已经从幕后走到台前，直接操纵这个侵略集团。可是，美国官方还竭力对此加以掩饰，故意强调“美国目前并不打算参加巴格达条约”，似乎美国同巴格达条约并没有密切关系。
    美国的这种掩饰是没有用的。谁都知道，巴格达条约本来就是美国在中近东推行殖民侵略政策的产物。和在世界上其他地区一样，美国在中近东也一直把组织军事集团作为它进行殖民侵略的重要手段。巴格达条约产生的整个过程就可以证明这一点。
    早在1951年，正当伊朗展开轰轰烈烈的石油国有化运动，并在中近东各国发生广泛影响的时候，美国就曾勾结英、法和土耳其向中近东国家提出了组织所谓“中东联合司令部”的建议，要求中近东各国把军队、基地、通讯设备和港口等移交这个“司令部”管理指挥。这个露骨的侵略计划，遭到了中近东各国人民的坚决反对而失败。1952年8月，美国又单独提出了一个改头换面的方案，要求中近东各国建立所谓“中东防务组织”。这个方案也遭到第一个方案的同样的命运。1953年5月，杜勒斯亲自去中近东进行所谓“视察”旅行。他回国后不久，就提出了预计由土耳其、巴基斯坦、伊拉克和伊朗参加的所谓“北层防御组织”方案。这就是后来建立的巴格达条约集团的雏型。
    1954年春，美国开始拼凑巴格达集团。在美国指使下，北大西洋集团成员国土耳其和东南亚集团成员国巴基斯坦首先订立所谓军事和经济合作协定。1955年2月，土耳其和伊拉克又签订了所谓“互助合作条约”，也就是“巴格达条约”。9、10月间巴基斯坦和伊朗先后参加了这个条约。
    英国也是巴格达条约的策划者之一。这个老牌殖民国家同样企图利用组织军事集团和“分而治之”的方法来保持它在中近东的殖民阵地。而且，为了防止被美国所排挤，英国在巴格达条约刚一成立的时候，就赶忙参加了这个条约。这样，在巴格达条约集团内部，就不可避免地发生了美英两个殖民国家争夺领导权的斗争。
    美国所以让英国参加而自己并不参加巴格达条约集团，是有它自己的打算的。美国看到阿拉伯各国人民反对西方军事集团的情绪日益强烈，所以它宁愿让英国出面来拼凑和扩大巴格达条约，从而担当阿拉伯人民反抗的风险。美国以为这样可以一方面在阿拉伯人民面前掩饰自己的殖民侵略的面目；另一方面，如果英国扩大了条约，它本身的力量一定负担不起而仍然要求助于美国。
    这样，美国便给自己选中了一个幕后操纵人的角色。它通过同这个集团的四个中近东国家签订的双边军事协定，通过军事基地网和军事顾问团，控制着这几个国家的经济、外交和军事活动。此外，美国虽然名义上不是巴格达条约集团的成员，但却早就参加了这个条约组织的“反颠覆委员会”和“经济委员会”。苏伊士战争以后，英国在中近东的影响遭到严重的削弱，美国又进一步参加“军事委员会”，并且担任了这个集团的联合参谋部的常任副参谋长。至此，美国已控制了这个集团的全部活动，并且成为这个集团的实际领导者。
    两年多来，美国利用巴格达条约集团在中近东进行了一系列的侵略活动，严重地威胁了中近东各国的独立和和平。
    首先，美国迫使参加巴格达条约集团的四个中近东国家走上扩军备战的道路。土耳其事实上已经成了美国在中近东的最大的兵营和军火库。伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦也迅速走上军事化的道路。美国大规模武装巴格达条约国家的做法，一方面使这些国家的人民承受了沉重的负担，财政经济危机日益加深；另一方面，也造成了中近东国家之间互相对立，使中近东局势经常处于紧张状态。
    其次，美国利用巴格达条约集团国家的军队和基地，不断对执行和平独立政策的中近东国家进行军事威胁，妄想强迫这些国家放弃民族主权，接受美国侵略政策。特别是土耳其的军事力量，成了美国不断使用的工具。在巴格达条约集团成立不久，美国就指使土耳其把部队集结在土叙边境，胁迫叙利亚参加巴格达条约。此后，每当中近东民族独立运动高涨的时候，土耳其都无例外地在土叙边境制造紧张局势。去年6月美国参加巴格达条约“军事委员会”的决定，又进一步加强了对这个集团的军事控制。同时，美国就同土耳其一起策划了侵略叙利亚的重大阴谋，企图在中近东燃起危险的战火。这个阴谋在叙利亚人民和世界和平力量的打击下，宣告失败了；但是它最清楚地暴露了美国利用巴格达条约集团国家进行冒险的严重性。
    美国还利用巴格达条约干涉中近东国家的内政并从内部对这些国家进行颠覆活动。有美国参加的巴格达条约“反颠覆委员会”，实质上是个对中近东民族独立国家进行颠覆活动的一个指挥机构。去年6月间，“反颠覆委员会”通知各成员国说，这个委员会的活动不仅要针对社会主义国家，而且也要针对印度、阿富汗、埃及和叙利亚等中立国家。巴格达条约国家的某些代表公开说“中立主义是巴格达条约的最大敌人”。会后不久，叙利亚就破获了由美国大使馆人员直接领导的大规模颠覆案。
    以上事实都证明，巴格达条约集团是美国在中近东进行疯狂侵略活动的一个重要工具。它的目的就是要把中近东变为新战争的温床和美国的殖民势力范围，以便于美国垄断资本集团为所欲为地掠夺这个地区的丰富的资源。正因为这样，阿拉伯各国人民把反对巴格达条约集团的斗争看作是维护民族独立和中近东和平的重要斗争。巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”一样，在中近东已成为众矢之的，从它出现的一天起，就遭到中近东人民越来越强烈的反对。现在，在某些巴格达条约国家内部，也在发生着值得注意的变化。美国有些侵略活动，已引起某些巴格达条约成员国的不安，因此并没有得到这些国家的支持。这些情况表明，这个集团已陷于瘫痪状态。
    但是，美国对于它的失败并不甘心。这次杜勒斯亲自出席安卡拉会议，目的就是要为这个集团打气，进一步控制这个集团，并利用它来加紧进行扩军备战活动，以威胁中近东的和平。
    1月21日，塔斯社受权发表声明，对于美国利用安卡拉会议进行威胁和平的活动，作了有力的揭露，并建议把中近东变为无原子区。这个声明受到了中近东各国人民的重视和欢迎。他们正为反对安卡拉会议的阴谋、为维护中近东的和平而斗争。亚非人民团结大会已经谴责了巴格达条约集团和“艾森豪威尔主义”，这是亚非十七亿人民的共同意志。美国如果不顾一切蛮干下去，那么倒霉的将是它自己。
