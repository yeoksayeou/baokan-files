Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch—After mobilizing the masses, breaking boundaries, conducting mutual comparisons, and shattering conservative thinking, the planned total output value of Beijing's local industry for this year has risen several times, now leaping to exceed last year's actual completion by 25%.

At the beginning of drafting this year's production plan, many leading cadres in Beijing's local industrial departments did not have a sufficient understanding of the current high tide of industrial and agricultural production, and the planned targets for the city's local industry were set even lower than the actual completion figures for last year. The second revised plan, although with great effort, only increased by 5% compared to last year. Later, many factories handed the plans over to the masses of workers for discussion, and the situation changed greatly. The planned targets of many factories increased not by a few percent, but by tens or even hundreds of percent. After the joint state-private enterprise Tongyi Water Pump Factory accepted the state's task of producing 4,000 water pumps, the enterprise's administrative leaders believed that there were difficulties, and requested the higher authorities to add 116 people, 11 precision machine tools, and build a factory building to accommodate 100 people. After the task was handed over to the masses for extensive discussion, the masses believed that the factory had great production potential. According to careful calculation, the man-hour quota could be compressed by 46%. As long as a shed was built, without adding machines or personnel, the production task could be completed, exceeding last year's by 133%. The boiler-camel machines produced by the Beijing General Machinery Factory are of good quality and low ex-factory prices, and there is no problem with sales. When compiling this year's production plan, the initial plan was for 500 units, which was later increased to 800 units. However, after all the workers in the factory studied the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), everyone was very motivated. Based on the specific situation of their workshops and work sections, they carefully calculated and tapped potential item by item, and came up with a large number of ways to increase production and save resources. As a result, this year's production plan for boiler-camel machines was increased to 2,220 units, nearly three and a half times higher than the initial plan. Now, a heated and vigorous competition has been launched between the workshops, teams, and individuals in this factory.

The main difficulty encountered by Beijing's local industry in organizing the Great Leap Forward in production is that the supply of many raw materials is insufficient. Their solution to overcome this difficulty is: on the one hand, to send people around to find raw materials; on the other hand, to strive to save, change varieties, or use substitutes. Last year, due to insufficient copper supply, the Beijing Wire Factory only utilized about 85% of its production capacity. Now, this factory has trial-produced aluminum wires, which can produce 5,000 kilometers of wires this year, not only saving more than 170 tons of copper, but also allowing the production capacity to be fully utilized. According to the situation of insufficient wood supply this year, the Guanghua Wood Factory plans to utilize the scrap materials that were sold as firewood in the past to manufacture sewing machine table tops and inexpensive furniture. In this way, the wood utilization rate will be increased from 68% last year to more than 80%. This year, the Renli Flax Spinning Factory plans to mix more than 50,000 catties of cotton stalk skin to weave 400,000 sacks, saving more than 40,000 catties of flax, which can increase the production of 50,000 sacks.

Some factories had difficulties in selling their original products and lacked confidence in increasing production. Now, after breaking conservative thinking, these factories have actively tried to understand market needs and increase new products. The Beijing Chemical Reagent Factory, which had a large backlog of products last year, recently sent more than 30 technicians to more than 30 units of various central ministries and more than 20 cities such as Baotou, Harbin, Urumqi, and Kunming to investigate the needs for reagents. They decided to include 104 new products in the production plan based on the opinions of users. In this way, the total output value of the factory this year can be increased by more than 30%. The Beijing Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced a truck crane, and has now received orders for more than 100 units.

Some factories that are unwilling to lag behind have organized their workers to visit advanced factories, compare their quality, cost, and various technical and economic indicators, find out the reasons for lagging behind, and vow to catch up. Some cadres of the Beijing Heating Material Factory originally thought that the cost could not be reduced and the output value could not be increased. Later, they sent technicians and workers to the Tianjin Steel Plant and the Xinxing Steel Plant to learn. Comparing the situation of their factory with these two factories, they found that their factory had advanced equipment, but the cost was high, the material consumption was high, and the economic indicators were backward. The factory absorbed the advanced experience of the Tianjin Steel Plant, and is now close to the level of the Tianjin Steel Plant in terms of saving electricity and quartz sand and improving the product qualification rate. On this basis, all the workers in the factory confidently set a production value plan that was 42.5% higher than last year. The Xinhua Rubber Factory also recently sent people to the Shanghai Dahua Rubber Factory to learn advanced experience, and formulated a plan to catch up with the Dahua Rubber Factory in terms of quality and cost indicators of rain boots this year.

At present, this is only the starting point for Beijing's local industry to leap forward, and the progress of each factory is not very balanced. In order to drive all factories to advance together, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the competent departments of Beijing's local industry have sent capable cadres to some factories with slower progress to organize the exchange of experiences between the relevant factories, further mobilize the masses, and conduct competitions while leaping forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch—After the factories under the Nanjing Municipal Local Industry Bureau continuously criticized conservative thinking and repeatedly mobilized the masses to carefully calculate, they formulated a plan for the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958.

According to statistics from 78 factories in the city's machinery, chemical, light industry, textile, and food industries, the planned total output value for this year will increase by 48.66% compared to last year's actual results, the profit will increase by 53%, and 308 new products will be trial-produced.

The 1958 production plan initially compiled by these factories last year was mostly conservative. The planned output value of 48 light industry, textile, and food factories only increased by an average of 3.1% compared to 1957. Some leaders of the Nanjing Glass Factory emphasized difficulties such as the inability to open up sales channels, insufficient technical strength, basic construction not keeping up with needs, and the decline in the price of wine bottles. The initial planned targets were even lower than the actual figures for 1957.

In response to the above situation, the Nanjing Municipal Local Industry Bureau held a meeting of factory directors, party committee secretaries, and cadres above the section chief level to examine, analyze, and criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking that underestimated the potential of enterprises. After discussion and analysis, it was pointed out that the Nanjing local industrial system already has the conditions for a Great Leap Forward in production, and leaders must not be lazy people on the economic front. Recently, the leaders of each factory, based on the initiative of the Nanjing Chemical Plant and 13 other factories to launch a socialist competition among the city's factories, and the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, further criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and analyzed the potential of each factory. After two revisions, the planned output value of 30 heavy industrial factories increased from 24% higher than last year to 58% higher than last year. After continuously overcoming conservative thinking, the planned output value of the Nanjing No. 1 Machinery Factory has now been increased to double that of last year.

By mobilizing the masses to carefully calculate and tap potential, the thinking of some enterprise leaders who were afraid to leap forward was further eliminated. This year, some old products of the Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory will be handed over to other factories for production, so they face the threat of reduced production. Later, they organized technicians, workers, and sales personnel to travel to 43 cities across the country, visited 859 user units, and found out the user units' requirements for new products. Now they can change from reduced production to increased production. In the process of visiting the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, the director, workshop director, and skilled workers of the Nanjing No. 1 Machinery Factory found that the man-hours consumed per unit of the 1617 lathe produced by the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory were more than half less than those of their own factory. By checking the man-hour quota, they finally found a series of technical and management problems and the potential for increased production. Through the symposium of veteran workers, the Nanjing Glass Factory found out the bottom of the potential, and the revised planned output value and profit plan have been greatly improved.

    北京南京不断克服右倾保守思想
    地方工业今年将有大跃进
    发动群众算细账挖潜力  组织各厂互相交流经验
    新华社18日讯　在发动群众、打开限界、互相评比、打破保守思想以后，北京市地方工业今年的总产值计划几度上升，现在已经跃进到超过去年实际完成数25％。
    在刚开始编制今年生产计划的时候，北京市地方工业部门许多领导干部对当前工农业生产高涨的形势认识不足，全市地方工业计划指标订得比去年实际完成的数字还低。第二次修订的计划，虽然经过很大的努力，也才比去年提高5％。后来，很多工厂把计划交给职工群众讨论，情况发生了很大的变化，许多工厂的计划指标不是百分之几，而是百分之几十以至百分之一百以上地上升。公私合营同益水泵厂今年接受了国家四千台水泵的任务，企业的行政领导干部认为有困难，向上级要求增加一百一十六个人、十一台精密机床和修建一座容纳一百人的厂房。把任务交给群众广泛讨论以后，群众认为厂里生产潜力很大，据仔细计算，可以把工时定额压缩46％，只要搭一个天棚，不添机器不加人，就可以完成超过去年133％的生产任务。北京市通用机械厂生产的锅驼机质量好、出厂价格便宜，销路没有问题。在编订今年生产计划时，第一次订五百台，后来提高到八百台，但是全厂职工学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）以后，大家劲头很足，他们根据本车间、本工段的具体情况，逐项算细账、挖潜力，就想出了大量增产节约的办法。结果今年锅驼机的生产计划就提高到二千二百二十台，比最初计划数提高近三倍半。现在这个厂的各车间、小组和个人之间已经展开了热火朝天的大竞赛。
    北京市地方工业在组织生产大跃进中，碰到的主要困难是许多原材料供应不足。他们克服这个困难的办法是：一面派人四处找原料；一面努力节约，改变品种或使用代用品。北京市电线厂去年由于铜供应不足，生产能力只发挥了85％左右。现在，这个厂试制了铝制电线，今年可以生产五千公里长的电线，不仅节省了一百七十多吨铜，而且可以使生产能力得到充分发挥。光华木材厂根据今年木料供应不足的情况，计划把过去当劈柴出售的碎料利用起来，制造缝纫机台面和廉价家具，这样，木材利用率将由去年的68％提高到80％以上。仁立麻纺厂今年准备掺用五万多斤棉秆皮来织四十万条麻袋，节省下来的四万多斤麻能增产五万条麻袋。
    有些工厂原有产品销路困难，增产信心不足。现在这些厂在打破保守思想以后，已积极设法了解市场需要，增加新产品。去年产品积压较多的北京市化学试剂厂，最近派了三十多个技术人员到中央各部的三十多个单位和包头、哈尔滨、乌鲁木齐、昆明等二十多个城市调查试剂需要情况，决定根据使用者的意见，将一百零四种新产品列入生产计划。这样，全厂今年的生产总值就可以提高30％以上。北京市机械厂试制成功了一种汽车起重机，现在已经接到一百多部的定货。
    有些不甘落后的工厂，纷纷组织职工到先进工厂参观，同他们比质量，比成本，比各种技术经济指标，找出落后的原因，立志赶上前去。北京市暖气材料厂有些干部原来总认为成本降不下来，产值提不上去，后来派了技术人员和工人去天津钢厂和新兴钢厂学习，把本厂同这两个厂的情况相比，发现本厂设备先进，可是成本高、用料多、经济指标落后。这个厂吸收了天津钢厂的先进经验，现在在节约电和石英砂、提高产品合格率方面，快要接近天津钢厂的水平了。在这个基础上，全厂职工就信心百倍地订出比去年提高42.5％的产值计划。新华橡胶厂最近也派人到上海大中华橡胶厂学习先进经验，并且订出了在今年内雨鞋的质量和成本指标赶上大中华橡胶厂的计划。
    目前，这只是北京市地方工业开始向前跃进的起点，各厂进展的情况还不很平衡。为了带动所有工厂共同前进，北京市工会联合会和北京市地方工业的主管部门已派出得力干部，到一些进展较慢的工厂中去，组织有关各厂互相交流经验，进一步发动群众，一边评比，一边跃进。
    新华社南京18日电　南京市地方工业局所属各工厂不断批判保守思想、反复发动群众算细账以后，制订出了1958年生产大跃进的计划。
    据全市机械、化学、轻工、纺织、食品等工业系统七十八个工厂统计，今年生产总值计划比去年实绩增长48.66％，利润增长53％，试制新产品三百零八种。
    这些工厂在去年第一次编制的1958年生产计划，绝大多数偏于保守。四十八个轻工、纺织、食品工厂的产值计划，平均只比1957年增长3.1％。南京玻璃厂部分领导人员强调销路打不开，技术力量不足，基本建设跟不上需要，以及酒瓶价格下降等等困难，第一次编制的计划指标比1957年实际还低。
    针对以上情况，南京市地方工业局曾召开各厂厂长、党委书记和科长以上干部会议，检查、分析和批判了对企业潜力估计不足的右倾保守思想，经过讨论分析，指出南京地方工业系统已经具备生产大跃进的条件，领导人员决不能做经济战线上的懒汉。最近，各厂领导人员根据南京化工厂等十四个工厂向全市工厂提出的开展社会主义竞赛的倡议，以及中共南京市委扩大会议的精神，又进一步批判右倾保守思想，分析各厂的潜力。经过先后两次的修订，三十个重工业工厂的产值计划，由比去年增长24％提高到了比去年增长58％。南京第一机械厂经过不断克服保守思想，现在产值计划已提高到比去年增加一倍。
    通过发动群众算细账、挖潜力，也进一步消除了某些企业领导人员不敢跃进的思想。南京水工仪器厂今年有些老产品要交给其他工厂生产，因此面临着减产的威胁。后来，他们组织技术人员、工人和供销人员走遍全国四十三个城市，访问了八百五十九个使用单位，摸清了使用单位对新产品的要求，现在已经可以变减产为增产。南京第一机械厂厂长、车间主任和技术工人在访问南京机床厂过程中，发现南京机床厂生产一六一七车床的每台耗用工时，比自己厂少一半以上。他们通过检查工时定额，终于找到了技术上和管理上一系列问题以及增产的潜力。南京玻璃厂通过老工人座谈会，摸到了潜力的底，修订后的产值计划和利润计划都大大提高。
