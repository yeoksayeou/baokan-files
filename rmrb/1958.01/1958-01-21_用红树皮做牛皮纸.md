    Making Kraft Paper from Red Mangrove Bark
    The Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill has successfully manufactured high-grade kraft paper using 80% red mangrove bark and 20% wood pulp, and officially started production on the 18th.
    Red mangrove bark is produced in Guangxi. Although the place of origin is far away, the quantity is large and the price is cheap. Using it can also reduce costs a lot. Red mangrove bark is a newly discovered raw material for papermaking. It can be mixed with rice straw pulp to replace hemp root to manufacture hemp board paper; it can also replace wood pulp to manufacture cement bag paper.

    用红树皮做牛皮纸
    天津市第一人民造纸厂用80％的红树皮和20％的木浆制造高级牛皮纸成功，18日正式投入了生产。
    红树皮产在广西，虽然产地远，但数量多，价钱便宜。用它成本也可以降低很多。红树皮是新发现的一种造纸原料。它可以和稻草浆混合代替麻根制造麻板纸；也可以代替木浆制造水泥袋纸。
