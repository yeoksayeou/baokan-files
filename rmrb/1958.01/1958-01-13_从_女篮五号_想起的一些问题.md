Some Questions Inspired by "Woman Basketball Player No. 5"
    Ren Hui

    "Woman Basketball Player No. 5," which received favorable reviews at the Asian Film Week and the World Youth Festival, has recently been released in major cities across the country. It is an excellent film worth watching. In addition to Liu Qiong and Qin Yi, the young director Xie Jin and many actors appearing on screen for the first time have achieved great success in this film, which is a gratifying achievement.

    Besides the achievements that should be affirmed, does this film also have shortcomings? I would just like to share some of my personal feelings.

    I want to point out a possible shortcoming of this film that may be easily noticed, but is quite important in nature. It can also be said to be a flaw on a jade, although this shortcoming will not overshadow the brilliance of the entire film.

    The shortcoming I want to point out is just a set design. However, due to the improper design of this set, the theme, story structure, and even the characters' personalities of this film have been somewhat damaged.

    This is the set when Lin Xiao Jie returns to her mother's home from Shanghai.

    Viewers who have seen this film will know that the film does not explain the process of the dozen or so years after Xiao Jie's mother was abused by her husband and divorced. From the specific circumstances of this film, it is entirely possible, and perhaps even necessary, not to explain it. However, the problem lies in the design of this set. Judging from the current situation in the film, it is difficult for the audience to understand what kind of life Lin Jie has lived in the past ten years. Judging solely from the set and the furnishings in the house, it seems that Lin Jie is living the life of a wealthy landlord or capitalist. Because in that era—roughly from after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan to before liberation in Suzhou—it would have been impossible for a single woman with a child to support to live in such a beautiful house and have such luxurious furnishings solely by relying on her own efforts. Rely on her father? She had already broken with her father long ago. Did she accept the inheritance? Not only is there no explanation, but even if that were the case, our common sense tells us that in that difficult era, it would have been difficult to maintain such a situation. Therefore, I say that due to the improper design of this set, the audience has many questions that could have been avoided, which has given a certain degree of damage to the character of Lin Jie, a positive character. I imagine that if this set were designed very simply, with simple furnishings, and a few lecture papers waiting to be graded or other small props that could suggest the profession she is engaged in were placed on Lin Jie's desk, then the audience would not only understand at a glance that Lin Jie is living a self-reliant life, but would also be more sympathetic to this character. In this way, the set can be smaller, the furnishings can be fewer, the production costs can be lighter, the work of the film crew can be simpler, and, on the contrary, the quality of the film can be improved. Why do things the hard way when it is possible to save effort? I think this is a not very commendable trend in our film and drama circles, and it can also be said to be an ideological problem.

    What kind of trend is this? This is not starting from the theme and highest mission of the entire play, but considering the problem in isolation, creating scenery for the sake of scenery, furnishing for the sake of furnishing—that is, deliberately and unrealistically "beautifying life."

    We do not approve of naturalism, but we disapprove even more of hypocritically "beautifying life." In films in recent years, whether they are farmers, workers, students, or government cadres, it is rare to see characters who are dressed a little old and simple. It is a fact that people's lives have improved, but it is obviously not a fact that everyone wears new clothes, everyone lives in new houses, and everyone dances at night. This situation is not only reflected on the screen and on the stage, but also in the descriptions in novels and the photographs in pictorials. If you don't believe me, you might as well take a look at the popular pictorials. Haven't even the rural girls and tea-picking girls all put on brand-new, brightly colored clothes? Look at our scenic documentaries. Haven't all the female comrades in the park put on cheongsams, and all the male comrades put on woolen suits or uniforms?

    From an artistic point of view, any set, costume, prop…everything on the stage and screen must be subordinate to the theme of the work, and even a small prop should have a clear purpose. From a political and ideological point of view, at this time when we are vigorously promoting "building the country diligently and frugally" and "running undertakings diligently and frugally," we should not use unrealistic images to promote extravagance and waste through powerful propaganda tools such as movies.

    I want to say it again, "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" is a good film, and what I have pointed out is just a small flaw that does not overshadow the merits of the film. However, behind this shortcoming, there is a trend reflected, and this trend is worthy of deep thought by our literary and art workers.

### 从“女篮五号”想起的一些问题

    从“女篮五号”想起的一些问题
    任晦
    在亚洲电影周和世界青年联欢节得到了好评的“女篮五号”，最近在全国各大城市公映，这是一部值得一看的优秀影片。除出刘琼秦怡之外，年青的导演谢晋和许多第一次上镜头的演员们都在这部影片中取得了很大的成绩，这是可喜的收获。
    除出应该肯定的成绩之外，这部影片是不是也还有缺点呢？我只想谈谈我个人的一点感想。
    我想指出这部影片的一个可能很被人注意、可是性质上却是相当重要的缺点，也可以说，这是美玉上的一点瑕疵，尽管这一缺点不会掩盖整个影片的光彩。
    我要指出的缺点只不过是一堂布景。可是，由于这堂布景的设计不当，而使这部影片的主题、故事结构、甚至人物性格，都受到了一定的损害。
    这就是林小洁从上海回到她母亲家里的那一堂布景。
    看过这部影片的观众都会知道，小洁的母亲自从遭受到她丈夫的虐待而离婚之后，中间十几年的过程，片子里并没有交代，从这部片子的具体情况来说，不交代是完全可以的，也许可以说是应该的，但是，问题就出在这一堂布景的设计。照现在片子中的情形来看，观众很难了解，林洁在这十几年中，究竟过着怎样的生活。单从布景和家里的陈设来看，似乎林洁过的是大地主、或者资本家的生活。因为，在那个年代——大概是抗战胜利之后到解放之前的苏州，一个单身的女人还带着一个需要抚养的孩子，单靠自食其力，是决不可能住这样漂亮的房子、有这样华丽的陈设的。靠她父亲么？她和父亲是早已决裂的了，她接受了遗产么？不仅没有交代，即使果有其事，我们的常识告诉我们，在那个艰难的时代，恐怕也很难维持这么一个局面的。因此我说，由于这堂布景的设计不当，使观众发生了许多本来可以不发生的疑问，也就是对林洁这个正面人物的性格，给了一定的损害。我设想，假如这一堂布景设计得很朴素，陈设很简单，在林洁的案头放几本待批改的课卷，或者别的什么可以暗示她正在从事的职业的小道具，那么，观众不仅一看就会了解，林洁过着自食其力的生活，而且，从此而更能引起对这个人物的同情。这样，布景可以小一些，陈设可以少一些，制片成本可以轻一些，摄影场工作人员的工作可以简单一些，而相反，影片的质量可以提高一些。为什么可省事而不省事，一定要做这种“吃力而不讨好”的事呢？我以为这是我们电影戏剧界的一种不很值得提倡的风气，也可说是一个思想问题。
    这是怎么样的风气呢？这就是不从整个戏的主题思想、最高任务出发，孤立地考虑问题，为布景而布景，为陈设而陈设，——也就是刻意地、不真实地“美化生活”的问题。
    我们不赞成自然主义，但是我们更不赞成虚伪地“美化生活”，最近几年来的影片中，不论是农民、工人、学生、机关干部，很少看到穿得破旧一点朴素一点的人物了，人民生活改善了是事实，但是人人都穿新衣、人人都住新屋、人人都在晚上跳舞则显然不是事实。这种情况不仅反映在银幕上、舞台上，同时也反映在小说的描写中，画报的照片上。谓予不信，不妨去看看流行的画报，不是连农村姑娘、采茶姑娘人人都穿上了全新的花衣服了么？看看我们的风景纪录片，不是公园里的女同志都穿上了旗袍，男同志都穿上了呢料西装或者制服了么？
    从艺术的角度看，舞台、银幕上的任何一堂布景、一套服装、一件道具……一切都得服从于这个作品的主题思想，连一件小道具也应该有明确的目的性，从政治思想角度说，值此大力提倡“勤俭建国”、“勤俭办事业”之时，更不应该通过电影这种强有力的宣传工具，用不真实的形象，来提倡铺张浪费。
    我要再说一遍，“女篮五号”是一部好影片，我指出的，对这部片子来说，也只是一个瑕不掩瑜的小缺点。但是，在这一个缺点后面，却反映出一种风气，而这种风气，却值得我们文艺工作者深思。
