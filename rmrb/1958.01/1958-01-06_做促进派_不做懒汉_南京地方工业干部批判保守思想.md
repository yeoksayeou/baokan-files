    Be Promoters, Not Loafers
    Nanjing Local Industry Cadres Criticize Conservative Thinking

    (Our Dispatch) Nanjing recently held a meeting of local industry cadres to review the 1957 plan fulfillment and discuss the 1958 production plan. Based on the new situation and tasks on the current industrial front, the meeting criticized right-leaning conservative thinking. Everyone believed that Nanjing's local industry is now capable of achieving a great leap forward in production, and leaders must not be economic loafers. Attendees all pledged to actively mobilize the masses and lead the new upsurge in industrial production after returning to their factories.

    The meeting first reviewed right-leaning conservative thinking in the 1957 production. According to statistics from 59 factories under the Municipal Industrial Bureau, the total output value exceeded the plan by more than 9% in 1957. The actual production of many factories far exceeded the annual plan. For example, the planned output of the Cannery was 1,600 tons, but the actual output was 2,674 tons; the planned output of the Qinfeng Cigarette Factory was 17,800 cases, but the actual output was 26,775 cases. These situations show that the originally compiled production plan for 1957 was somewhat conservative. The main reasons for the emergence of right-leaning conservative thinking were a one-sided understanding of the "launch" and "dismount" issues at the beginning of last year, an underestimation of the potential of enterprises, and especially an inappropriate assessment of the achievements and shortcomings of the work in 1956. Therefore, when arranging the production plan, they adopted a passive attitude of "rather be conservative than commit rashness," wanting to reduce trouble, save effort, and live a "stable" life. Now it seems that if the plan had been more advanced when the annual plan was formulated last year, the production situation last year would have been even better.

    After discussion, the leaders of each factory unanimously agreed that building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way is the urgent demand of the people of the whole country, and that it is a glorious and important task to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years. Enterprise leaders and Communist Party members should live up to the expectations of the people and be genuine revolutionaries and promoters. Everyone also cited many facts to show that there is still great potential in enterprises. For example, the equipment utilization rate of the Fourth Machinery Factory, the Electrical Machinery Factory, and the Clock Factory is only about 60%-68%. After the rectification movement, the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has been unprecedentedly high, and the leadership style and production management have been greatly improved. Therefore, the conditions for a great leap forward in production are already mature. Many factories with faster rectification progress have already seen a new upsurge in production. Through realistic and concrete analysis, the attendees greatly increased their confidence and boosted their revolutionary spirit. Enterprises under the Heavy Industry Bureau alone proposed to add 46 new products in 1958; the First Machinery Factory guaranteed that the output value in 1958 would increase by more than 49% compared to last year.

    做促进派　不做懒汉
    南京地方工业干部批判保守思想
    本报讯　南京市最近召开了一次地方工业干部会议，检查了1957年完成计划的情况，讨论了1958年的生产计划。会议根据当前工业战线上的新形势和新任务，批判了右倾保守思想。大家认为，目前南京地方工业已经具备了生产大跃进的条件，领导人员决不能做经济战线上的懒汉。到会人员都保证回厂以后要积极发动群众，领导好新的工业生产高潮。
    会议首先检查了1957年生产中的右倾保守思想。据市工业局所属五十九个工厂的统计，1957年总产值超过计划9％以上。许多工厂实际生产情况超过年度计划很多。例如罐头食品厂原计划产量是一千六百吨，实际完成二千六百七十四吨；勤丰烟厂原计划产量是一万七千八百箱，实际完成二万六千七百七十五箱。这些情况表明1957年原编的生产计划有些偏于保守。产生右倾保守思想的原因，主要是在去年年初对“上马”、“下马”的问题有片面的理解，对企业潜力估计不足，特别是对1956年工作的成绩和缺点估计不当；因而在安排生产计划的时候，采取了“宁可保守，不犯冒进”的消极态度，想减少麻烦，少费力气，“四平八稳”地过日子。现在看来，如果去年在编制年度计划的时候，把计划订得先进一些，去年的生产情况将会比现在更好。
    各厂领导人员经过讨论，一致认为多快好省地建设社会主义是全国人民的迫切要求，十五年左右在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国是一件光荣重大的任务，企业领导人员、共产党员应该不辜负人民的期望，做一个名副其实的革命者、促进派。大家还列举了许多事实，说明企业中还有很大的潜力，例如第四机械厂、电机厂、造钟厂的设备利用率都只有60％—68％左右；经过整风运动，广大职工的政治热情空前高涨，领导作风和生产管理都有很大改进，因此生产大跃进的条件已经成熟。不少整风进度较快的工厂已经出现了新的生产高潮。通过实事求是的具体分析，到会人员都大大增强了信心，革命干劲都鼓起来了。仅重工业局所属企业就提出1958年要增加四十六项新产品；第一机械厂保证1958年的产值要比去年再增长49％以上。（陈浩然）
