Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Ministry of Forestry issued a notice at the beginning of the year, requiring forestry departments in various regions to rapidly launch a large-scale mass greening movement to welcome a new upsurge in forestry construction.

The notice stated: In the current production upsurge, forestry departments in various regions should actively plan and rely on the masses to create various new forests, such as timber forests, economic forests, fuel forests, and water and soil conservation forests to support mountainous area construction, etc. Continuing to carry out the "four-sides" tree planting movement (note: the four sides are: beside houses, beside villages, beside roads, and beside waterways) deeply and extensively is one of the most important tasks at present. To this end, the agricultural and forestry departments or forestry departments (bureaus) of each province (city) and autonomous region should first help agricultural cooperatives to prepare greening plans and incorporate greening work into the production plans of agricultural cooperatives, striving for the emergence of more afforestation "thousand-mu cooperatives," "five thousand-mu cooperatives," and "ten thousand-mu cooperatives" nationwide. In the four-sides tree planting movement, especially in the plains areas, it is required that farmers universally plant trees, and that "ten-tree households," "hundred-tree households," "five hundred-tree households," and "thousand-tree households" universally emerge.

The Ministry of Forestry also requested that all regions fully prepare seedlings and pay attention to promoting advanced experiences and improving the quality of afforestation during afforestation.

    林业部号召迎接林业建设新高潮
    广泛开展四旁植树运动
    积极规划，依靠群众营造各种新林
    新华社6日讯　林业部年初发出通知，要求各地林业工作部门迅速开展大规模的群众性绿化运动，迎接林业建设的新高潮。
    通知上说：在当前生产高潮中，各地林业部门应积极规划，依靠群众营造各种新林，如营造用材林、经济林、薪炭林和配合山区建设的水土保持林等等。深入广泛地继续开展四旁植树运动，更是当前的重要工作之一（按：四旁是宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁）。为此，各省（市）、自治区的农林厅或林业厅（局）首先应帮助农业社作好绿化规划，把绿化工作切实纳入农业社的生产计划之内，争取全国出现更多的造林“千亩社”、“五千亩社”和“万亩社”。在四旁植树运动中，特别是平原地区要求农户普遍植树，普遍出现“十株户”、“百株户”、“五百株户”、“千株户”。
    林业部还要求各地充分作好种苗的准备工作，并在造林中注意推广先进经验和提高造林的质量。
