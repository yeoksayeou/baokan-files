        Speaking Against His Conscience
    Chen Haiguan is a worker in the sawmill workshop of the Xiantao Farm Implement Factory in Mianyang, Hubei. He is a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party, a member of the Mianyang County Trade Union Executive Committee, the vice-chairman of the factory's trade union, and has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced producer more than ten times.
    After the factory launched the rectification movement in October last year, he made a series of erroneous statements at various speaking out meetings, maliciously attacking the Party and the socialist system. He said: "The lives of farmers have not improved at all after collectivization. Saying collectivization is good is entirely a lie by the cadres"; "The living standards of workers have not improved. Workers have not been liberated in their lives. They don't eat enough, the liquor isn't strong, and the problem of the stomach can't be solved"; "Workers don't have freedom...". Those who knew his background said he was speaking against his conscience, forgetting his roots, and treating paradise as hell.
              Twenty Years of Hellish Life
    Looking at Chen Haiguan's family and personal life history, it is truly shocking and horrifying. He was originally from Liuhe Township in Xiaogan County. His father, Chen Yiyuan, made a living by working as a long-term laborer and tilling tenant land. When he was eight years old, his mother became seriously ill due to overwork and had no money for treatment. Just as she was dying, the landlords Tu Houyuan and Chen Shuzhi came to press for debts, literally forcing her to death. After his mother died, the debts grew more and more. In less than two years, the ancestral house that had been passed down for generations was seized by the landlord Tu Houyuan, and more than two mu of ancestral graveyard land was seized by the landlord Chen Shuzhi. The whole family had no roof over their heads or land to stand on and had to settle in a dilapidated thatched shed. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese devils came, the thatched shed was also occupied by the devils as a stable, and the whole family's life was precarious. In order for the whole family to survive, the father hardened his heart, with tears in his eyes, sent his ten-year-old sister to be a child bride, sent his six-year-old sister to the Catholic Church to be a nun, and gave his one-year-old brother to someone else as a foster child. Then the father and son went out to escape the famine, begging door to door for a living.
    Chen Haiguan, who was not yet twelve years old, followed his father to carry "foot power" (transporting goods), earning a few coins to barely make a living. Unfortunately, his father, who had been ravaged by wind, frost, hunger, and cold for many years, fell ill in a dilapidated temple, and his life was cut off. The young Chen Haiguan had no relatives or neighbors on his left or friends on his right. He cried to heaven but received no answer, and called out to people but no one paid attention. He had no choice but to dig up wild water chestnuts and wild garlic every day and boil them into soup to fill his stomach. At the age of fifteen, he worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord, but the landlord thought he was too young and weak and not worth keeping as a long-term laborer. He was only allowed to work for four months during each busy farming season, and his livelihood for the rest of the year was still uncertain. For the sake of survival, his father tried every means to introduce him to a private wooden board factory in Wuchang as an apprentice. But the life of an apprentice was even worse than that of a slave. He had to get up before dawn every day to make a fire and cook, carry dozens of loads of water during the day, climb the dock more than forty times, and could not sleep until everyone else was asleep. During his three years as an apprentice, he never wore a new pair of shoes, and a patched-up short coat could only cover his body and not keep him warm. As soon as his apprenticeship was over, he was fired by the boss. He had to pull a cart and carry stones in the Hanyangmen area of Wuchang to make a living. When he could not survive, he secretly prayed to heaven: "Heaven! When will we poor people have a chance to stand up"!
            The Day the Poor Rose Up Has Arrived
    On May 16, 1949, Wuchang was liberated, and the day the poor rose up had arrived. Chen Haiguan returned to his hometown of Xiaogan and actively participated in the rent reduction and anti-hegemony and land reform movements. He became the militia squad leader in the township, and his father was also elected as a member of the poor peasants' association. During the land reform, his family recovered the houses and land that had been seized by the landlords, and were allocated cattle, farm tools, and two mu of good land, as well as clothes, furniture, and more than five hundred jin of grain. Then, he married a women's federation member in the township, and a happy family was established. At that time, he himself said with emotion: "This is something I never dreamed of!"
    In 1952, he entered the Xiantao Farm Implement Factory in Mianyang as a sawyer, earning a monthly salary of 43.30 yuan. His family could not finish eating all the grain every year, and they could not spend all the money. In 1955, after setting aside enough grain for the family, he sold more than 1,200 jin of surplus grain. After his family joined the cooperative in 1956, the grain they received was more than enough to eat, and they also had a three-fen private plot to grow vegetables. Now, his family also raises a large fat pig and more than fifty chickens. His wife and children make two new sets of clothes every year. From the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth to the present, he himself has used 297 chi of cloth for making clothes and quilts. The whole family has leather shoes, rubber shoes, and sneakers, and there are more than 90 yuan in savings. It is truly a family of plenty. In the past, he was illiterate, but now he is in the fifth grade of the workers' night school and can read books, newspapers, and general documents. Both his material and cultural life have been significantly improved. But he closed his eyes and hardened his heart, obliterating these convincing and vivid facts. He truly "forgot the pain once the sores healed, and forgot the well-digger when drinking water."
            Bourgeois Ideology Confused His Mind
    Chen Haiguan's release of many erroneous remarks this time has its reasons. This is because he has been eroded by bourgeois ideology, and despicable and shameful individualism has confused his mind. He believes that now that he has been liberated, he should enjoy a little, eat better, and dress better. In order to make his life happier, he perversely came up with some evil ways. In 1955, he did not allow his wife to engage in agricultural production in the countryside, but brought her to live idly in Xiantao Town, and contracted the fields allocated to his family to his former poor friend Peng You to cultivate, paying him 12 yuan per mu of land from planting to harvesting and storing. That year, there was a bumper harvest, and he was happy and smiling, saying: "It's so good to be able to sit and collect grain without participating in labor!" "There is income in the countryside and income in the factory. If we accumulate for another two years, we can buy land and become rich!" The upsurge of agricultural collectivization in 1956 blocked his path to getting rich through exploitation, and his family also joined the cooperative. From then on, he began to become dissatisfied with the Party and collectivization.
    In the factory, he also began to despise labor, only wanting to work less and earn more money. He felt that being a sawyer was manual labor and had no future, so he asked to become a cadre or a technician. He said: "Mechanical workers drive lathes effortlessly, how comfortable!" When these demands were not met, he became emotional, complained, and bargained in production. During the wage reform in 1956, he said: "Manual labor has no future, there is no increase in wages or promotion for me, I am the one who suffers losses and takes the lead, others enjoy the benefits, what's the point? Don't work yourself to death, save some capital (referring to the body) and then talk." Therefore, he worked passively, sawing one or two chi less wood per day on average. Because his despicable individualistic desires were not satisfied, he spoke against his conscience in the rectification movement.
          Rein in at the Brink of the Precipice, Turning Back is the Shore
    Since he made a series of erroneous remarks at various meetings, the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Mianyang County Party Committee and the County Trade Union have successively sent people to talk to him individually. The comrades of the working group sent to the factory by the county talked to him eight times. At the training meeting for rectification activists held in the county, his remarks were taken out for debate. Only then did he begin to admit his mistakes and make a preliminary self-criticism of some of his erroneous remarks. He said: "Peng You and I used to work as long-term laborers for the landlord Chen Shuzhi. Now I am exploiting him again. It is truly a shameful act and taking the old road of one person becoming rich and thousands becoming poor in the old society." He said: "In the past, when I worked as a long-term laborer, I earned three shi of grain per season. When I was sick, the landlord would not allow me to rest and forced my father to replace me. Now, my monthly salary is 43.30 yuan. When I am sick, my salary is still paid, and the medical expenses are reimbursed by the public. There are also holidays. Compared to the past, it is a world of difference." In order to further help him turn back, the County Trade Union, with his consent, held an exhibition of the contrast between new and old life for him at the Xiantao Workers' Club. During the exhibition, he went to see the exhibition three times. The first time, he hesitated at the entrance of the exhibition hall, afraid to go in. He said: "It seems like thousands of people are questioning me." After a period of fear and hesitation, he finally mustered the courage to enter the exhibition hall. He had only just seen three pictures when the tragic scenes of his mother being forced to death and his whole family of five being scattered and separated reappeared before his eyes. Tears kept streaming down his face. Someone asked him to explain it himself, but he choked with sobs and could not speak. The second time, with tears in his eyes, he looked through it from beginning to end. The more he looked, the more sad he felt, as if he was being pricked by needles, hating himself for taking the wrong path. A group of elementary school students who were visiting the exhibition surrounded him and asked: "Uncle Chen Haiguan, why did you forget your roots?" His face turned red, and he was too ashamed to answer a word. The third time, he looked at the exhibition again, touching each of the exhibits. The contrast was truly one in the ground and one in the sky. At this time, his ideological struggle became more intense. He said: "I can't sleep after returning from the exhibition. The more I think about it, the more I feel sorry for the Party. Every night I have dreams. One night I dreamed that I came home from work, lifted the pot lid, and the pot was empty, the stove was cold, my stomach was so hungry that it kept crying, and I couldn't help but cry. I woke up from this cry."
    Now, Chen Haiguan has turned back. He asked to tell the worker brothers about his experience of forgetting his roots and turning back. His production has improved, and he can now overfulfill the plan. (Attached picture)

    陈海官回头
    唐永耀
                昧着良心说话
    陈海官是湖北沔阳仙桃农具厂锯木车间的工人，是中共正式党员，沔阳县工会执委，厂工会的副主席，并连续十几次被评为先进生产者。
    去年10月间，厂里开展整风运动以后，他在大小鸣放会上，发表了一系列的错误意见，恶意地攻击党，攻击社会主义制度。他说：“合作化以后农民生活一点没有提高，说合作化好完全是干部撒的谎”；“工人生活水平没有提高，工人在生活上没有翻身，吃饭不饱，喝酒不辣，肚子不能解决问题”；“工人不自由……”。知道他的底细的人，都说他昧了良心，忘了根本，把天堂当地狱。
              地狱生活二十年
    揭开陈海官的家庭和他个人的生活历史一看，真是令人惊心动魄，毛骨悚然。他原是孝感县六合乡人，父亲陈贻远靠打长工、种佃田为生。他八岁时，母亲由于劳累过度，得了重病，无钱医治，正当病势垂危、奄奄一息的时候，地主涂厚元、陈书之上门逼债，活活的被逼死了。母亲死后，债越欠越多，不上两年，祖传几代的一栋房屋就被地主涂厚元盘剥去了，二亩多祖坟田也被地主陈书之盘剥去了。全家人上无片瓦，下无寸地，只好在一间破茅棚内安身。不料日本鬼子一来，茅棚也被鬼子占去做马棚，全家生活朝不保夕。为使全家人能活下去，父亲硬着心肠，噙着眼泪，把他十岁的姐姐送给人家做童养媳，把六岁的妹妹送进天主堂当修女，把一岁的弟弟给人家做螟蛉子，然后父子俩出外逃荒，沿门乞讨维生。
    不满十二岁的陈海官，就随着父亲挑“脚力”（搬运货物），挣几个钱糊口度日，不幸，长年累月受风霜、饥寒摧残的父亲病倒在破庙里，生活绝了路。年幼的陈海官，左无亲邻，右无朋友，喊天天不应，呼人人不理，只好每天去挖些野荸荠和野蒜头煮点汤来充饥度日。十五岁上，他就给地主打长工，但地主嫌他年纪小，体力弱，留着长年干活不合算，每年农忙时准他做四个月的活，全年的生活仍没着落。为了生计，他父亲想尽千方百法，托人把他介绍到武昌一家私营木板厂当学徒。那知学徒生活比奴隶还不如，每天天不亮就起来烧火做饭，白天挑几十担水，爬四十多次码头，晚上人不睡完他不能睡。他学徒三年，没有穿过一双新鞋，一件补上加补的短袄，只能遮体，不能御寒。学徒生活刚刚满期，就被老板解雇了。他不得不在武昌汉阳门一带拖板车，挑石头渡日子，无法生活下去时，他暗暗地祷告苍天：“天哪！我们穷人那天才能有出头之日”！
            穷人出头的日子盼到了
    1949年5月16日，武昌解放了，穷人出头的日子到了。陈海官回到孝感老家，积极参加减租反霸和土地改革运动。他当上了乡里的民兵分队长，他父亲也被选为贫农团的委员。土改时，他家收回了被地主霸占的房屋和土地，分得了耕牛、农具和二亩好地，还有衣服、家具和五百多斤谷子。接着，他和乡里一位妇联委员结了婚，幸福的家庭建立起来了。当时他自己也感动地说：“这真是做梦也没想到的事！”
    1952年他进沔阳仙桃农具厂当锯工，每月工资四十三元三角，家里每年粮吃不了，钱用不完。1955年留足一家口粮后，还售余粮一千二百多斤。1956年他家参加合作社后，分得的粮食够吃有余，还有三分地的自留地种菜，现在家里还喂了一口大肥猪，五十多只鸡。他的爱人、小孩每年都做两套新衣。他自己从实行棉布计划供应到现在，做衣服、被子就用去二百九十七尺布。全家皮鞋、胶鞋、球鞋齐全，还有九十多元的余款，真是丰衣足食之家。过去他一字不识，现在在职工夜校读五年级，能看书看报和一般文件了。不管是物质生活、文化生活都有了显著的改善和提高。但他却闭着眼睛、横着心，把这些令人信服的活生生的事实一笔抹杀了。他真是“好了疮疤忘了疼，喝水忘记了挖井人”了。
            资产阶级思想迷了心
    陈海官这次放出许多错误的言论，是有由来的，这就是受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，卑鄙可耻的个人主义迷了心。他认为翻了身，自己应享受一点，吃好点，穿好点。为了让自己的生活更幸福一些，就偏着良心想出了一些邪门道。1955年，他不让自己的爱人在农村劳动生产，把她接到仙桃镇上闲住，把家里分得的田，包给他往日的穷朋友彭友耕种，从下种到收割归仓，每亩田给十二元工资。这年丰收了，他喜在眉头笑在心，说：“不参加劳动也能坐着收谷，多么好啊”！“农村有收入，厂里有收入，再积累两年就能买田置地，大大发家了”！1956年农业合作化高潮堵死了他想靠剥削发家致富的门路，他家里也入社了。从此，他就开始对党、对合作化不满起来。
    在工厂里，他也开始轻视劳动，光想少干活多拿钱。他嫌当锯工是手工操作，没有前途，就要求当干部、当技术工人。他说：“机械工人开着车床不费力，多舒服呀”！当这些要求得不到满足的时候，他就闹情绪，发牢骚，生产上讨价还价。1956年工资改革时，他说：“体力劳动没前途，增工资提级没有我的份，吃亏带头是我，享受是别人，这有啥搞头呢？别给累死了，留点老本钱（指身体）再说”。因此，他消极怠工，平均每天少锯一、二尺木板。由于他的卑鄙的个人主义欲望没有得到满足，所以，在整风运动中就昧着良心说话。
          悬崖勒马，回头是岸
    自从他在大小会上放出一系列的错误言论以后，中共沔阳县委工业交通部、县工会都先后派人同他个别谈话。县里下厂工作组的同志，就同他谈了八次话。在县里举办的整风积极分子集训会议上，把他的言论拿出来辩论。他才开始认错，并对自己的一些错误言论作了初步的自我批判。他说：“我同彭友过去一道给地主陈书之打长工，现在我又剥削他，真是可耻的行为，是走旧社会一人富千人穷的老路。”他说：“我过去打长工，一季三石谷，病了地主不准休息，硬逼着父亲去顶替。现在每月工资四十三元三角，病了工资照发，药费公家报销，还有例假，比起来真是天壤之别”。为了进一步帮助他回头，县工会在取得他的同意后，在仙桃工人俱乐部为他举办了一个新旧生活对比展览会。展览期间，他三次去看了展览。第一次，他走到展览馆门口，犹豫不前，怕进去，他说：“好像有成千上万的人在责问我”，经过一段时间的惶恐徘徊，终于鼓足勇气走进了展览馆。刚刚看了三张画，他母亲被逼死，全家五口人四分五离的凄惨情景，就重新呈现在他眼前。他的眼泪不住地往下淌。有人请他自己讲解，但他泣不成声地讲不下去。第二次，他噙着眼泪，从头到尾的看了一遍，越看心里越难过，像被针子扎一样，痛恨自己走错了道路。参观展览会的一群小学生，围着他问：“陈海官叔叔，你为什么要忘本呀”？他面红耳赤，惭愧得一句话也答不出来。第三次，他又看了展览，陈列的实物，件件都亲自摸过，对比起来，真是一个在地下，一个在天上。这时他的思想斗争更加激烈，他说：“看了展览会回来就睡不着觉，越想越觉得对不起党。每夜我都作梦，有一夜梦着我干活回家，把锅盖一揭，锅里空空的，灶冷冰冰的，肚子饿得直叫，不觉哭起来。这一哭就醒了”。
    现在，陈海官回头了。他要求向工人兄弟们讲述自己忘本回头的经过。他的生产有了起色，计划又能超额完成了。（附图片）
