On the Performance of "Liren Xing"
Tián Hàn

The China Youth Art Theater selected my old work "Liren Xing" for its performance commemorating the 50th anniversary of the spoken drama movement. I am both apprehensive and happy. Its rehearsal was taking place while I was abroad, and as the playwright, my exchange of ideas with the director and actors was insufficient. However, I have watched it three times in a row since the official dress rehearsal. I agree with some of the director's handling and have also offered some suggestions to them, some of which have been revised later. For example, the scene where Jinmei returns home late at night and gets up again after sleeping was deleted by the director, but I disagreed and it was added back. The overall performance of the play is very good. But I also have some things I want to say.

First, some comrades asked, since the author of this play was inspired by the Shen Chong case in Beijing and the street vendor case in Shanghai, and the Shen Chong case occurred at the end of 1946, how can the play's description say it happened in 1945? This is of course because under the rule of the Kuomintang at that time, it was difficult to perform plays that opposed the United States and the dark rule, so they were all changed to events before the Japanese imperialists surrendered. But at that time, the audience was very clear in their minds. Therefore, in the final scene, when it was already known that Japan had surrendered, when Liu Jinmei asked Li Xinqun: "From now on, will foreign imperialists dare not bully Chinese women anymore? Will street vendors no longer be interfered with by the police when selling goods on the streets?" etc., it was actually a kind of satire, because these tragedies all happened after the Japanese surrender, and the effect was very good at that time, but today's audience does not feel that way (the director seems to lack detailed explanation here).

Second, in the final scene, when the Japanese imperialists surrendered and Chinese planes were dispatched to scatter leaflets, the original script did not emphasize this point, because the planes belonged to the Kuomintang side. Instead, the final spotlight was cast on the three women. Have Jinmei and the others' problems really been solved? Is the "bitter victory" at that time really worth being enthusiastically happy about? Our workers are concerned and deeply worried, so I would rather have an ending that is closer to Chekhov's "Three Sisters," one that is more thoughtful and profound, rather than pursuing too much excitement. I wonder if Comrade Jin Shan agrees with this opinion?

Third, this play has three lines. Originally, Xinqun's line was always weaker, because she always helped others and rarely had her own independent scenes. Now that the character of Zhou Fan has been added, there are more scenes. However, the performers' understanding of Zhou Fan seems to be lacking, and they have not given him enough play. The two scenes of Xinqun's primary school are combined into one, which seems more compact, but there are inevitable hasty points in the development of the plot.

Zhang Yuliang's line with Liang Ruoying is generally richer. Are there some scenes (such as the arrest and dinner scenes) that could be more detailed and powerful? Comrade Lu Xi's makeup often covers her face with rich hair, making it impossible to see her expressions, which is quite a loss. In the prison scene, when they hear the screams of their fellow prisoners being tortured, they should not only have comradely concern, but also psychological and physiological reactions because this kind of suffering is waiting for every prisoner at any time. They shouldn't be indifferent. They should express their silent anger towards the enemy. – “What kind of world is this!” Then slowly move to the problem of military blankets, which would be more appropriate. The voices of the female comrades in the same prison should be louder. I always feel that our actors' voices are too low at times, and they are simply inaudible, causing audience anxiety. Such a low voice is naturalism, not realistic. Performances in Soviet theaters rarely have inaudible lines. Even when a low voice is needed, it can still be heard, which requires the actors to have training in diction.

You Sheng's voice is low and loud, which is a good condition. But he shouldn't always be sleeping in bed. He has bad eyesight, but his body is not paralyzed. A person who comes from a metalworker background should be solid and active. In the final fight with the hooligan, generally speaking, a person with poor eyesight suffers because he cannot touch the enemy. Once he catches the enemy, he will never let go easily and will definitely twist the enemy until he yields. Such a big hooligan wouldn't easily escape. Can it be handled better and more credibly?

Fourth, a Japanese Kempeitai captain like Shimada is very sinister and capable. The actor's appearance is good, but he should speak Chinese more fluently in order to convey his mischievous insidiousness. Don't have too many meaningless "cooperation" words. He said, "Discovering that you are not Meng Nan is no advantage, because Zhang Yuliang is what we want to see even more." The word "advantage" was missing in the printed script. Therefore, the actor said, "Discovering that you are not Meng Nan is nothing," and the meaning changed.

The Japanese special service agencies, governments, and the army and navy each have their own systems, and there are also contradictions between the navy and the army. This also gives us a gap. Originally, using only one plainclothes agent oversimplified the enemy too much, which was not in line with the situation. Later, a different actor was replaced to monitor Yuliang, which was correct.

I always feel that there should be a script that reflects that revolutionary stage. I hope that through continuous performances and criticisms, this play can be improved.

This kind of drama form is very common in the Soviet Union. It is not necessarily a living newspaper play. Many classical and modern plays also adopt this form. This reduces the burden of scenery, allows for rapid scene changes, and reflects a wide range of life.

What the audience wants to see is always the play, not the scenery itself. According to the accounting comrades of the Qingyi Theater, this play is very much in line with the spirit of thrift they have implemented. The performance cost of each play at Qingyi has increased to a maximum of 9,000 yuan. Generally, it is also around 4,000 yuan. The lowest performance cost has never been less than 1,500 yuan. In addition to making more than 600 yuan worth of costumes and props, the scenery and lantern slides were slightly modified based on the existing ones, and almost no money was spent. The total performance cost was 740 yuan, breaking the previous record. I am very proud to have this benefit in the high tide of anti-waste.

Some comrades have also written to question me why I have not worked hard to express the new and greater reality since liberation? I should fully accept this question and have already started to catch up and do so.

    关于“丽人行”的演出
    田汉
    中国青年艺术剧院纪念话剧运动五十年演出选定了我的旧作“丽人行”，我又是惶恐，又是高兴。它的排演正在我出国的时候，作为剧的作者，我和导演演员交换意见是很不够的。但从正式彩排起我一连看过三次。我同意导演者一些处理，也跟他们提过一些意见，有的后来也做了修改了。如金妹深夜回家，睡了又爬起来那一场导演删去了，我不同意，又加上了。整个戏的演出是很好的。但我也还有一些想说的话。
    一、有的同志问，既然这个戏的作者是受了北京沈崇案和上海摊贩案的刺?，而沈崇案是1946年年底的事，怎么这戏的说明者却说是1945年的事呢？这当然因为当时在国民党统治下，要演出反美和反黑暗统治的戏是困难的，所以都改成日本帝国主义者投降以前的事。但当时观众心里是很明白。因此当最后一场，已知道日本投降了，刘金妹问李新群：从今以后外国帝国主义者是不是不敢再欺负中国女人了？摊贩在马路上卖货是不是不再受警察干涉了？等等，那实际是一种讽刺，因为这些悲剧都是日帝投降以后的事，当时效果是很好的，而今天观众听起来就没有那样的实感了（导演同志在这里似乎也欠缺细致的交代）。
    二、末一场，日本帝国主义投降，中国飞机出动撒传单，原剧本没有强调这一点，因为飞机是国民党方面的。而把最后的脚光投射在三个女人身上。金妹她们的问题是不是真正解决了呢？当时的“惨胜”是不是真值得狂热地高兴呢？我们的工作者是操心彻，虑患深的，因此我宁愿有一个近乎契诃夫的“三姊妹”那样较为思索的深沉的结尾，而不必太追求热闹。不知道金山同志同意这意见么？
    三、这戏有三根线，原来总是新群这根线较弱，因为她总是帮助别人，很少自己独立的戏，于今加了周凡这个人物，戏多了些了。但演出者对周凡这人物的理解似乎还欠明确，也没有给他足够的发挥，新群的小学校两场拼为一场，似乎紧凑些，但在情节发展上难免有草率之处。
    章玉良跟梁若英这根线一般总是较为充实的。有几场戏（如被捕和晚餐那两场）是不是还可以细致有力一些？路曦同志的化妆，时常让丰富的头发遮住了脸，看不见表情，是颇为损失的。监狱那场，她们听到难友受刑的惨叫，不止是应有同志式的关怀，而且由于这种苦难是随时等待着每一个囚犯的，她们应该有心理的以及生理的反应。不应该不甚关心。她们应该表示对敌人的无言的愤怒。——“这是什么世界！”然后慢慢移到军毯问题才较为合适。同狱女同志的声音要大一些，我总觉得我们的演员有时声音太低，简直听不见，引起观众焦烦。这样低的声音是一种自然主义，不是生活化。苏联各剧院的演出很少让人听不见的台词。需要低声的也能让人听得见，固然这是要求演员吐词有训练的。
    友生的嗓音低而响亮，这是好的条件。但他不应老睡在床上，他是眼睛不好，但身体并未瘫痪，五金工人出身的人应该坚实活跃些。最后与流氓打架那场，大体眼睛看不见的人吃亏在摸不到敌人的方面，一旦抓到了敌人，便决不轻于放手，一定扭住敌人非打到他屈服不止。那样的大流氓按说也不会轻易逃走的。是不是可以处理得再好一点，再可信一点。
    四、日本宪兵上尉岛田这样的人是很险恶能干的，演员造型好，但中国话讲得要较流畅，才能传达他的俏皮阴险。不要有太多意义不明的协和语。他说“发现你不是孟南也没有什么便宜，因为章玉良更是我们要看见的。”这里的“便宜”两字剧本里印丢了。所以演员说成“发现你不是孟南也没有什么。”意思就走了样了。
    日本的特务机关，政府与陆海军各有系统，海军与陆军也有矛盾。这也就给我们以间隙。原来只用一个便衣特务就把敌人太简单化了，也不合情况。后来监视玉良的换了一位演员，这是对的。
    我总觉得，还是应该有反映那一革命阶段的剧本，希望在不断的演出和批评之下，改好这个戏。
    这一种戏剧形式在苏联是很多的，不一定活报剧才这样，许多古典剧和现代剧也有采这种形式的。这样搞布景负担轻，场面变化迅速，反映生活面宽。
    观众要看的始终是戏，而不是布景自身。据青艺的会计同志告诉我这个戏很符合他们所贯彻的节约精神。青艺每个戏的演出费，最多的增到九千元。一般地也是四千元左右。最低的演出费也没有下于一千五百元。这个戏除制了六百多元的服装道具以外，布景、灯片都是就原有的略加改动，几乎没有用什么钱。全部演出费七百四十元，打破了以前的记录。在反浪费的高潮中能有这个好处，我很引以为荣。
    也有些同志写信来责问我，何以解放以来不努力表现新的更伟大的现实？这一责问我完全应该接受，已经在急起直追地这样办了。
