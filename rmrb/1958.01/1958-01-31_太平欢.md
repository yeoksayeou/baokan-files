    Joy of Peace

    Celebrating the ninth anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Beijing,
    On this very day,
    See the red flag raised above Tiananmen Gate.
    Destroying millennia of feudal fortresses,
    Without a drop of blood shed.
    Baskets of food and pots of drink,
    Yangko dances and waist drums,
    Joyful shouts resound through the heavens.
    The wind spreads far and wide,
    The merit of peace shines in the forefront.
    Rejoicing in the foundation of the nation,
    People's democracy,
    Creating a new China.
    Vibrant and flourishing new atmosphere of the East,
    Year after year the landscape increases in beauty;
    Spring melts on Hainan Island,
    Golden Terrace shines in the sun,
    Broadening the great cause of peace and prosperity.
    Singing in unison,
    May the divine capital flourish without end!

    太平欢
    李济深
    喜颂和平解放北京九周年纪念日当年今日，看红旗、升上天安门阙。摧毁千年封建垒，兵刃未沾点血。箪食壶浆，秧歌腰鼓，霄汉欢呼彻。风从遐迩，和平功昭前列。喜自奠定邦基，人民民主，创造新中国。勃勃东方新气象，岁岁河山增色；琼岛春融，金台日丽，宏拓升平业。同声欣颂，神京昌盛无极！
