Since the 29th, the Beijing Children's Palace's Juvenile Hall has hosted New Year's Eve celebrations for children for four consecutive evenings. The China Children's Art Theatre, China Children's News, New Children's News, China Children's Publishing House, and Beijing Children's Palace jointly organized over two thousand four hundred children to joyfully celebrate the New Year of 1958.

On the evening of the 31st at 6:00 PM, groups of children dressed in colorful clothes arrived at the hall, which was decorated with palace lanterns. Next to a row of pine trees adorned with colorful light bulbs, they participated in prize-winning games and group dances. Suddenly, two beautiful "little birds" lit firecrackers, attracting all the children present, and the party officially began. Amidst the joyful sounds of gongs and drums, the New Year Old Man arrived at the venue. He used a recitation poem to wish the children a happy new year and enthusiastically praised:

"1957 was an extraordinary year,
The flowers of our motherland's socialist construction,
Appeared like a myth, one after another
..."

He also brought many guests who were very familiar to the children, such as Sun Wukong, Wu Song, and other opera performers, as well as the main characters from the plays "Children's Corps" and "Magic Lotus Lantern." These guests introduced themselves through performances and danced and played games with the children. In circles around the venue, actors from the performing arts troupes and acrobatic troupes performed acrobatics and sang songs, filling the entire venue with joyful laughter and a lively atmosphere.

Just as the children were having fun, the lights in the hall went out. A crescent moon and a starry night sky appeared on the stage. The Soviet artificial satellite moved slowly across the sky. To the melodious sounds of flutes and music, Chang'e walked and danced, bringing her little white rabbit from the moon palace to the human world. She welcomed the children to travel to the stars on artificial satellites in the future. The children welcomed her to join the party and share the joy of the New Year.

Finally, the Old Dragon King came on stage to bid farewell to the children because he had to move his home to avoid being disturbed by the workers building the Yangtze River Bridge and the Sanmenxia Dam on the Yellow River. At this moment, the loud chimes of the clock struck twelve times. The New Year Old Man announced the arrival of 1958. He wished the children new achievements in their studies, exercise, and labor in the new year, along with the vigorous development of the motherland's socialist construction. The children, with excitement, bid farewell to 1957.

    红领巾的除夕
    少宫
    从29日起，在北京市少年宫的少年厅里，连续四天晚上都举行了少年儿童的新年同乐晚会。中国儿童艺术剧院、中国少年报、新少年报、中国少年儿童出版社和北京市少年宫共同组织了二千四百多小朋友欢欢乐乐地庆祝1958年新年。
    31日晚上六时，一队队穿着花衣裳的孩子们来到了悬挂着宫灯的大厅中，在一排缀着彩色灯泡的松树旁作有奖游戏比赛和跳集体舞。突然，两个美丽的“小鸟”点响了爆竹，吸引了全场的孩子们，晚会正式开始了。在欢乐的锣鼓声中，新年老人来到会场。他用朗诵诗，向孩子们祝贺新年好，并热情地歌颂：
    “1957年是不平常的一年，
    我们祖国社会主义建设的花朵，
    就像神话一般地一朵一朵地出现
  ……”。
    他还带来了许多孩子们非常熟识的客人，像孙悟空、武松等戏曲演员，“儿童团”“马兰花”等剧中主人公。这些客人用表演作了自我介绍，并且和孩子们一起跳舞、做游戏。在一圈圈的场地中，还有文工团、杂技团的演员们玩杂耍和唱歌，使整个会场充满了愉快的欢笑和热闹的气氛。
    正当孩子们玩得高兴时，台下灯光熄灭了。台上现出一钩弯月和闪耀着星星的夜空。苏联的人造卫星在天幕上缓缓移动，在悠扬的笛声和音乐声中，嫦娥边走边舞，带着她的小白兔也从月宫来到了人间。她欢迎孩子们将来坐人造卫星去星空旅行。孩子们欢迎她参加晚会共享新年的快乐。
    最后，老龙王登台向孩子们告辞。因为他要回去搬家，免得修建长江大桥和筑黄河三门峡水坝的工人们赶他。这时，洪亮的钟声“当当”地响了十二下。新年老人宣布1958年来临了。他祝孩子们在新的一年，随着祖国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，也在学习、锻炼和劳动方面取得新的成绩。孩子们带着兴奋的心情，送走了1957年。
