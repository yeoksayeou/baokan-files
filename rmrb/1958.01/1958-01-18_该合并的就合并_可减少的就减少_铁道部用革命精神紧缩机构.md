Merge What Should Be Merged, Reduce What Can Be Reduced:
Ministry of Railways Uses Revolutionary Spirit to Streamline Organizations

(Our report) The Ministry of Railways has essentially completed its work on streamlining organizations.

According to preliminary decisions, the Ministry of Railways' affiliated units have been streamlined from thirty-two to twenty-three. Among them, the original Engineering General Bureau, Design General Bureau, and Capital Construction Bureau have been merged into the Capital Construction General Bureau; the Personnel Bureau and Education Bureau have been merged into the Personnel and Education Bureau; the Planning Bureau and Statistics Bureau have been merged into the Planning and Statistics Bureau; and the Freight Bureau and Business Bureau have been merged into the Freight Bureau.

The original units of the Ministry of Railways had a total of 276 sections, offices, divisions, groups, and teams, which have been streamlined to 128 sections, offices, divisions, and groups. For example, the merged Capital Construction General Bureau has been streamlined from the original sixteen sections, forty-nine divisions, and five offices to fourteen sections and two offices. Due to the streamlining of organizations, the number of staff has been reduced by 1,128 people, a reduction of 40.6%. The merged Capital Construction General Bureau has been reduced from the original 638 people to 255 people, a reduction of 60%.

Throughout the streamlining of organizations and personnel allocation, the Ministry of Railways consistently implemented the mass line method of combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, and combining leadership with the masses, boldly mobilizing the masses to conduct discussions. The rectification leading groups of the Ministry of Railways and its various units particularly emphasized the need to present tasks, make detailed calculations, raise questions, reason things out, and implement the revolutionary spirit of seeking truth from facts. Therefore, this work of streamlining organizations and personnel allocation has been done well and thoroughly. Not only has there been a significant reduction in organizational structure and staffing, but also cadres and the masses have been educated in the process of streamlining organizations and personnel allocation.

In early December of last year, after the general rectification had come to a close, the Minister of Railways, Teng Daiyuan, made a mobilization report to all staff on streamlining organizations and decentralizing personnel. While discussing Teng Daiyuan's mobilization report, the staff also studied relevant documents, gaining a preliminary understanding of the spirit and significance of streamlining organizations and decentralizing personnel. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways' rectification leading group comprehensively studied the opinions of the staff on the organizational structure of the ministry expressed during the period of vigorous airing of views, put forward a preliminary plan for streamlining organizations and personnel allocation within the ministry, and submitted it to various units for discussion. At the same time, the opinions raised by the staff during the discussion were promptly collected, revised, and resubmitted to the masses for discussion. This repeated top-down and bottom-up discussion, revision, rediscussion, and rerevision resulted in a relatively reasonable and practical plan. For example, when the Engineering Bureau discussed streamlining its organization, it held 24 small group discussions, one large group meeting combining four divisions, and three small group leader symposiums from December 7th to 16th last year. After ten days of mass repeated discussions and debates, a relatively unified plan was finally reached. The majority agreed to merge the existing eight divisions, one office, one team (bridge inspection team), and one station (labor productivity quota determination station) into two sections, two divisions, and one office, reducing the number of staff from 116 to 55 to 60.

During the mass discussions on streamlining organizations and personnel allocation, the various units of the Ministry of Railways also paid special attention to ideological work. For example, when the Freight Bureau discussed the plan for streamlining organizations and personnel allocation proposed by the Ministry's rectification leading group, some people felt that it lacked a basis and could not be realized, believing that the Freight Bureau had already been streamlined to the limit, had already "undergone revolution" (i.e., had been streamlined in the past), and could not "re-revolutionize." In response to this situation, the Freight Bureau's rectification leading group was determined to mobilize the masses for debate. After a major debate and clashes between various sections and offices, the staff of the entire bureau overcame their erroneous ideas, and the majority finally clarified that the staffing could still be reduced, and the work could still be done well.

After the mass discussion on streamlining organizations and personnel allocation came to an end, the Party Group of the Ministry of Railways convened the directors of various bureaus to discuss and finalize the organizational structure and personnel allocation of each unit on a case-by-case basis. During the discussion, the leaders of the Ministry of Railways emphasized that what should be merged should be resolutely merged, the power that should be decentralized should be decentralized, and what should be managed should be managed well, so that there would be fewer people, but the work would be done well. For example, the discussion of the People's Supervision Bureau resulted in a need for twenty-nine people, and the leadership believed that twenty-nine people were still too many, and finally decided on twenty people. The Design Budget Appraisal Committee originally had thirty-one people. Because its task is to appraise and approve railway capital construction engineering design budget technical documents on behalf of the minister, according to the established technical policies, national capital construction plans, and existing relevant regulations and laws, the quality requirements are high. In order to strengthen the design budget appraisal work, it was also decided to add one person.

### 该合并的就合并　可减少的就减少  铁道部用革命精神紧缩机构

    该合并的就合并　可减少的就减少
    铁道部用革命精神紧缩机构
    本报讯　铁道部的紧缩机构工作已经基本结束。
    根据初步的决定，铁道部所属单位由三十二个紧缩为二十三个。其中原工程总局、设计总局和基本建设局已合并为基本建设总局；人事局和教育局合并为人事教育局；计划局和统计局合并为计划统计局；货运局和商务局合并为货运局。
    原铁道部各单位共有处、室、科、组、队二百七十六个，紧缩后共有处、室、科、组一百二十八个。如合并后的基本建设总局即由原来的十六个处、四十九个科、五个室精简为十四个处、两个室。由于机构紧缩，工作人员就减少了一千一百二十八人，即减少了40.6％。合并后的基本建设总局即由原来的六百三十八人减少到二百五十五人，减少60％。
    铁道部在紧缩机构定员中，自始至终贯彻了自下而上、自上而下、领导与群众相结合的群众路线的方法，放手发动群众进行讨论。铁道部和各单位的整风领导小组都特别强调了要摆任务、算细账、提问题、讲道理，和贯彻革命的实事求是的精神。因此这次紧缩机构定员工作做得较好，较彻底，不仅机构定员有了很大的减少，而且在紧缩机构定员的过程中教育了干部和群众。
    去年12月初，铁道部在一般整改告一段落以后，即由部长滕代远向全体职工作了紧缩机构、人员下放的动员报告。职工在讨论滕代远的动员报告的同时，又学习了有关的文件，对紧缩机构、人员下放的精神和意义有了初步的认识。以后，铁道部整风领导小组即把职工在大鸣大放中对部的机构体制方面的意见加以综合研究，提出部内紧缩机构定员的初步方案，交各单位讨论。同时又及时收集职工在讨论中提出的意见，再修改再交群众讨论，这样反复的自上而下和自下而上地进行讨论、修改，再讨论、再修改，就得出比较合理而又切合实际的方案。如工务局，在讨论紧缩机构时，从去年12月7日到16日的十天中先后召开了二十四次小组座谈会，一次四个科合起来的大组会和三次小组长座谈会。经过十天的群众性反复讨论和争辩，终于得出了一个比较统一的方案。多数人同意将现有的八科一室一队（桥梁检定队）一站（工率定额检定站）合并为二处二科一室，定员从一百十六人，减为五十五人到六十人。
    在群众讨论紧缩机构定员中，铁道部各单位还特别注意了思想工作。如货运局在讨论部整风领导小组提出的货运局紧缩机构定员的方案时，有的人认为缺乏根据，无法实现，认为货运局已经紧缩到头了，已经“革过命”了（即过去曾紧缩过），不能“再革命”了。根据这种情况，货运局整风领导小组下定决心，发动群众辩论。全局职工经过大辩论和各处室之间交锋，克服了错误思想，最后大多数人都明确了定员还能减少，工作还是能做好的。
    在群众性的讨论紧缩机构定员告一段落以后，铁道部党组召集了各局局长对各单位的机构定员逐个讨论定案。在讨论时，铁道部领导上强调该合并的坚决合并，权力该下放的下放，该管的要管起来，既要人少，又要把工作作好。如人民监察局讨论结果需要二十九人，领导上认为二十九人仍太多，最后决定为二十人。设计预算鉴定委员会，原来有三十一人，由于它的任务是根据已定的技术方针政策、国家基建规划和现行各项有关规程法令，代部长鉴定批准铁路基本建设工程设计预算技术文件，质量要求高，为了加强设计预算鉴定工作，还决定增加一人。
