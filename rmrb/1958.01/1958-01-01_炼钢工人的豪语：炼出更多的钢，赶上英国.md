Steelworkers' Bold Declaration:
	Smelt More Steel, Catch Up with Britain
	In the first and second large-scale steel plants of Anshan Iron and Steel, the steelworkers fighting by the steelmaking furnaces victoriously completed the task of increasing steel production by 100,000 tons for the country this year, on the last day of this Five-Year Plan.
	At noon today, dazzling sparks of steel erupted from the Youth Friendship Furnace, marking the 938th heat of steel produced by this furnace throughout the year. While tapping the steel, the steelworkers were busy repairing the furnace and immediately adding raw materials, striving to produce another heat of quick steelmaking tonight to see off the last day of the first Five-Year Plan. After a period of intense labor, Li Shangzhong, a famous steelmaking expert, told reporters, "The Youth Friendship Furnace has overfulfilled the state plan by more than 8,000 tons of steel this year. Next year, we will use new enthusiasm and new methods to protect the furnace even better and strive to increase steel production by another 18,000 tons compared to this year."
	On the No. 2 open-hearth furnace, the sister furnace of the Youth Friendship Furnace, Li Shaokui, a nationally renowned steelmaking expert, began working as a steelmaker today; he had been working as a furnace protection technician for the previous period. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years, he expressed his determination to use his own hands and wisdom to participate in this race to catch up with Britain. Today, the workers of No. 2 open-hearth furnace were all smiles, greeting the second Five-Year Plan with full of victorious confidence, and preparing to produce more high-quality steel for the country.

    炼钢工人的豪语：
    炼出更多的钢，赶上英国
    在鞍钢第一第二两座大型的炼钢厂里，战斗在炼钢炉旁的炼钢工人们，在这五年计划的最后一天，胜利地完成今年给国家增产十万吨钢的任务。
    今天中午，从青年友谊炉上喷射出耀眼的钢铁火花，这是这个炉子全年炼出的第九百三十八炉钢水。炼钢工人一面出钢一面紧张地修补炉子，马上又加原料，争取今晚再出一炉快速炼钢，来送别第一个五年计划的最后一天。著名炼钢能手李尚忠结束了一阵紧张的劳动之后，对记者说：“青年友谊炉今年超额八千多吨钢完成了国家计划，明年我们要用新的干劲、新的办法，把炉子保护得更好，争取在明年比今年的钢产量再提高一万八千吨。”
    在青年友谊炉的姊妹炉——二号平炉上，闻名全国的炼钢能手李绍奎从今天开始，在这座平炉上当了炼钢工；前一个时期，他改作了护炉技师。当党中央提出十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召以后，他表示要用自己的双手和智慧，来参加这个赶上英国的竞赛。今天二号平炉的工人，个个满面笑容，他们满怀着胜利的信心迎接第二个五年计划，准备为国家增产更多的优质钢。（附图片）
