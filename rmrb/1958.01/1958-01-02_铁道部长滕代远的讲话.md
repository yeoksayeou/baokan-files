Comrades, friends:

The newly built Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been inspected and delivered for operation, and today it is officially open to traffic on the entire line. This is another victorious achievement of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in carrying out socialist construction. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways and the national railway workers, I would like to extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the conference!

The official opening of the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway line is of great significance politically and economically in our country. The construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been the wish of the Chinese people, especially the people of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan, for many years, but only after the people became the masters of the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has this wish become a reality. The railway began surveying and designing from Chengdu to Lueyang in May 1950 and from Baoji to Lueyang in September 1952. After comparing many route plans, it broke the conclusion that railways were difficult to pass through the Qinling Mountains before liberation. Finally, the current route was selected. Construction started from Chengdu northward in July 1952, and construction started simultaneously in sections from Baoji to Fengxian, Fengxian to Huangshahe, and Lueyang to Huangshahe in 1954. The section from Chengdu to Shangxiba opened to traffic in October 1955, and the section from Baoji to Shangxiba was connected at Huangshahe in July 1956, thirteen months ahead of the original connection plan. The entire line is 668 kilometers long and took five and a half years to complete and officially open for business. The completion of this railway connects the southwest and northwest regions of our country and connects the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway with the national railway network. Through it, it also supports the construction projects of the Sichuan-Guizhou and other southwest railways that are being extended. Sichuan Province has been known as the "Land of Abundance" since ancient times. The abundant rice and local products it produces can be transported out from this line; the rich mineral and power resources it contains can be transported in machinery for development from this line. The completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will play a huge role in strengthening material exchange, further improving people's lives, promoting the cultural and economic development of the southwest region, and supporting national industrial and agricultural construction and national defense construction.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway passes through many dangerous mountains and passes, and the terrain and geology along the line are extremely complex. The project is arduous, and the degree of difficulty is rare in the history of railway construction in the world. The route selection is correct. Due to poor geological conditions along the line, some sections of the construction had suffered from subgrade diseases, and a large landslide occurred in 1956; after active rectification, the diseases that had occurred in the past have been basically rectified. After the evaluation of the National Acceptance and Handover Committee, it is considered that the bridges, tunnels, and large buildings are solid and beautiful, the subgrade is stable, and the overall project quality is rated as excellent, and it can be delivered for official operation.

The successful completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is first and foremost due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council; secondly, the concern and support of the people across the country, especially the timely leadership and assistance given by the Party, government, and military organizations and social groups of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces, and the strong support given by various brotherly departments and enterprises. These support and assistance provided an important guarantee for the successful completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Party, government, and military leading departments and social groups of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, various central departments, and brotherly enterprises!

The achievement of this great achievement in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is inseparable from the help of the experts sent by the Soviet government. The experts' superb technology and high degree of internationalist spirit helped us overcome many technical difficulties and gave our employees a profound education and a good example. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways and all the railway construction workers, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet experts!

In the process of designing and constructing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the entire team of railway builders, with heroic spirit, made the high mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way. They resolutely overcame difficulties and carried out a tenacious struggle with nature day and night. They put in hard work, enriched their skills in building the motherland, and strengthened the technical team. In particular, they completed the glorious task of completing and opening the Baoji-Chengdu Railway ahead of schedule, making a great contribution to the country and the people. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the railway construction workers!

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has connected the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the nationally constructed railways into a whole. All the employees of the management department that took over the Baoji-Chengdu Railway! I hope that you will conscientiously do a good job in maintenance and repair, continuously improve the quality of the line, closely connect with the neighboring brother bureaus, work diligently, and run the transportation business well, so as to better serve the people of the whole country. I wish you success and victory in your future work!

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway project is rich and colorful. The completion of this railway has provided rich experience and lessons for our country to build railways in mountainous areas in the future. All the employees who built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway! I hope that you will summarize and carefully remember the experience and lessons of building this railway, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to work hard to learn from Soviet experts, conscientiously implement the policy of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, so as to meet the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country, and strive to complete the task of building new railways more, faster, better, and more economically.

### 铁道部长滕代远的讲话

专栏：

    铁道部长滕代远的讲话同志们、朋友们：
    新建宝鸡成都铁路，已经经过验收，交付运营，今天全线正式通车了。这是我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，进行社会主义建设的又一胜利成就。我谨代表铁道部和全国铁路职工向大会致以衷心的、热烈的祝贺！
    宝成铁路的全线正式通车，在我国政治上、经济上有着重大的意义。修建宝成铁路是我国人民、特别是陕西、甘肃、四川人民多少年来的愿望，但是只有在人民作了国家的主人之后，在中国共产党的领导下，才使这个愿望变成了现实。这条铁路在1950年5月、1952年9月分别从成都到略阳、宝鸡到略阳，开始进行勘测设计，经过许多条线路方案的比较，打破了在解放前认为铁路难以通过秦岭山岳地带的结论，最后才选定了现在的这条线路，并且在1952年7月由成都开工往北修筑，1954年宝鸡至凤县间、凤县到黄沙河间、略阳到黄沙河间相继同时分段开工，1955年10月成都到上西坝间通车营业，1956年7月宝鸡到上西坝间在黄沙河接轨，比原定接轨计划提前了十三个月。全线共长六百六十八公里，共历时五年半全线建成并正式交付营业。这条铁路的建成，把我国西南和西北地区联结起来了，把成渝铁路同全国铁路联接起来了。通过它，也支援了正在延伸的川黔等西南各铁路的修建工程。四川省自古称为“天府之国”，它所出产的富饶的大米和土特产品，可以从这条线运出去；它所蕴藏着的丰富的矿产和动力资源，可以从这条线运入机器加以开发。宝成线的建成，对于加强物资交流，进一步改善人民生活，促进西南地区文化和经济的发展，以及支援国家工农业建设和国防建设，都将起着巨大的作用。
    宝成铁路所经过的地方多为险山隘道，沿线的地形地质极其复杂，工程是艰巨的，其艰巨的程度在世界铁路修建历史上也是少有的。线路方向的选择是正确的。由于沿线地质不良，在修建中的一些地段曾出现过路基病害，1956年曾发生过大的坍方；经过积极整治之后，过去发生的病害已经基本上整治完竣。这次经过国家验收交接委员会的评定认为：桥梁、隧道大型建筑坚固美观，路基稳定，全部工程质量总评为优良，可以交付正式营业。
    宝成铁路的胜利建成，首先是党中央和国务院领导的正确；其次是全国人民的关怀和支援，特别是甘肃、陕西、四川三省党、政、军和社会团体给予的及时的领导和帮助，各兄弟部门、各兄弟企业给予各方面的大力支援。这些支援和帮助，给宝成铁路的胜利建成提供了重要保证。我谨代表铁道部，向陕西、甘肃和四川省的党、政、军领导部门和社会团体，各中央部门和各兄弟企业，致以衷心的感谢！
    修建宝成铁路这一伟大成就的取得，是同苏联政府派来的专家们的帮助分不开的。专家们精湛的技术和高度的国际主义精神，帮助我们克服了不少技术上的困难，并且给了我们广大职工以深刻的教育和良好的榜样。我谨代表铁道部及全体筑路职工，向苏联专家们致以衷心的感谢！
    在宝成铁路设计和施工的过程中，筑路的全体职工们以豪迈的气魄，使高山低头、河水让路，遇到困难坚决加以克服，日日夜夜同自然界进行着顽强的斗争，付出了辛勤的劳动，丰富了建设祖国的本领，壮大了技术队伍，尤其是提前完成了宝成铁路修竣通车的光荣任务，为国家和人民作出了巨大的贡献。我谨代表铁道部，向筑路的全体职工同志们致以衷心的感谢！
    宝成铁路已经把成渝铁路和全国已建成的铁路联成一个整体。接管宝成铁路的管理部门的全体职工同志们！希望你们认真作好养护和维修工作，不断提高线路质量，密切联系相邻的兄弟局，兢兢业业，办好运输事业，更好地为全国人民服务。我预祝你们未来工作的成就和胜利！
    宝成铁路工程是丰富多彩的。这条铁路的建成，为我国今后修建山岳地区铁路取得了丰富的经验教训。修建宝成铁路的全体职工同志！希望你们总结并好好记取修建这条铁路的经验教训，戒骄戒躁，继续努力向苏联专家学习，认真贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，以迎接我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，为又多又快又好又省地完成新建铁路任务而努力。
