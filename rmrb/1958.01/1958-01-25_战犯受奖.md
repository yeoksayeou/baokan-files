    Awarding a War Criminal

    The Japanese government has decided to posthumously award a medal to the war criminal Takebe Rokuzo, the former chief of general affairs of the puppet "Manchukuo," who died a few days ago. According to the Japanese news agency, this decision was made by the cabinet as an exception, because, according to regulations, Takebe was not on the list of those eligible for awards.

    The mourner's tears are for the living to see. Awarding a medal to the dead soul of a war criminal is nothing more than encouragement for the living war criminals. However, to describe Takebe's crimes of aggression in China as "posthumous achievements," could it be that some Japanese authorities today have not forgotten the "brilliant achievements" of the "September 18th Incident"? However, those who award medals to war criminals should be clear-headed; the times have long changed, and since the past "sweet dreams" have been completely shattered, today's dreams are at most just dreams.

    战犯受奖
    日本政府决定对前几天死亡的战争犯罪分子、前伪“满洲国”总务长官武部六藏授予勋章。据日本通讯社说，这个决定是由内阁破格作出的，因为按规定，武部并不在授勋之列。
    吊客的眼泪，是给活人看的。为战犯的死魂灵授勋，也无非是对活着的战犯的鼓励。但是，把武部在中国的侵略罪行，说成是什么“生前的功绩”，莫非今天日本当局人士中还有人没有忘怀于“九一八”的“赫赫战果”吗？不过，给战犯授勋的人们应该放明白些，时代早就变化了，过去的“美梦”既然都已经完全破灭了，今天的梦想顶多也不过是梦想而已。
