Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 1st: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on December 31, 1957, that the Jordanian government had not stopped its provocative policies against Syria, nor had it ceased its practice of deviating from the independent Arab line.

On the same day, the Syrian Foreign Ministry published the full text of its official note to the Jordanian government on February 11, 1957.

The spokesman said, "We believe that publishing the full text of this note is the best way to respond to the recent interview given by Jordanian King Hussein to the Associated Press. In this interview, Hussein said that the Syrian note was a blatant interference in Jordan's internal affairs. Hussein also insisted that Syria's policies were largely similar to those of the Soviet Union and that the Syrian Foreign Minister was defending Soviet policies and Soviet interests."

    叙利亚发言人
    指责约旦仍在对叙挑衅
    据新华社大马士革1日电　叙利亚外交部发言人在1957年12月31日说，约旦政府并没有停止对叙利亚的挑衅政策，也没有中止它脱离阿拉伯独立路线的作法。
    同一天，叙利亚外交部发表了它在1957年2月11日致约旦政府的正式照会的全文。
    发言人说，我们认为，发表这个照会的全文，是最好地答复约旦国王侯赛因最近向美联社记者发表的谈话。侯赛因在这次谈话中说，叙利亚的那项照会是对约旦内政的公开干涉。侯赛因还硬说，叙利亚的政策同苏联的政策大体相似，并且说叙利亚外交部长正在维护苏联的政策和苏联的利益。
