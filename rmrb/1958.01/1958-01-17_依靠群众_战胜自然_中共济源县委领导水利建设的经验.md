Relying on the Masses to Conquer Nature
    ——The Experience of the CCP Jiyuan County Committee in Leading Water Conservancy Construction
              By our reporter, Shang Kai
    Many people want to know the experience of Jiyuan County, Henan Province, in leading water conservancy construction. For this reason, I visited the Jiyuan County Committee of the CCP. Comrade Zhao Shimin, the County Party Secretary, told me: There is no mystery here. It's just that the Party grasped the demands of the masses, fully mobilized the masses, and closely relied on the masses, with everyone working together to launch an attack on nature.
    The natural characteristics of Jiyuan County are severe drought in the mountainous areas and severe flooding in the plains. The vast majority of the masses have a very urgent need for soil and water conservation and flood drainage. At previous county people's congresses, there have been many proposals on governing the Mang River, which requires the County Party Committee to fundamentally consider the overall governance of drought and flood disasters.
    How should the problem be solved? This was still a new problem for the Jiyuan County Committee, which had just shifted from leading class struggle to leading production struggle. There was no experience and no method. However, the Jiyuan County Committee was not intimidated by the difficulties. On the one hand, they called on the masses to "everyone contribute ideas and everyone come up with suggestions." On the other hand, led by the County Party Secretary, they went up the mountains and down to the countryside, visited the masses, conducted investigations and research, and sought solutions. In the Huling area of the mountainous region, they saw that some hilltops were covered with trees and grass slopes, and the phenomenon of soil erosion had stopped. In the hilly areas, they found that some people used earthen cellars to store rainwater, enough for a year's consumption. During droughts, a farmer named Zhao Guanyi in Xiaye Village used cellar water to irrigate two mu of corn, yielding more than 240 jin per mu. In Gengzhang Township, they found that many people were imitating the method of Zhao Xinze, a model laborer from Meng County, building terraced fields into arc-shaped terraces that were high around the perimeter and low in the middle, and also building soil ridges on the field surface to retain mud. After observation, it was proved that such terraced fields had a high capacity for water storage and moisture retention. In the river gullies and tributaries, they saw that a large amount of rainwater was being wasted. This reminded them of the good experience of Yichuan County in building small reservoirs to intercept floods for irrigation. In the low-lying areas, they found that some people had achieved good harvests by changing to planting rice or building ditch-terrace fields. The Jiyuan County Committee believed that these were all good ways to resist drought and flood disasters created by the masses and promoted them in many places. However, at that time, they did not consider them as a whole. For example, when building earthen cellars in the hilly areas, they only thought of storing water for drought resistance, and did not think that it could also control slope runoff and reduce water damage downstream. Also, in the mountainous areas, they only paid attention to the fact that closing the mountains for afforestation could maintain soil and water, and did not consider leaving pasture to develop animal husbandry, which created conflicts between forestry and animal husbandry. Later, the County Party Committee studied the experience of the state in governing the Huai River, and their guiding ideology suddenly became clear. They said: The Huai River can have large-scale basin planning, why can't we have small-scale basin planning? The Huai River can build large projects, why can't we build small projects? The Huai River mainly relies on state investment, why can't we mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to govern it? Therefore, they linked together the various governance experiences and made a comprehensive plan for the overall management of the Mang River. According to this plan: In the mountainous areas, trees should be planted and forests should be cultivated, mountains should be closed for afforestation, grass slopes should be protected, and soil erosion should be controlled; in the ridge and slope areas, terraced fields should be universally renovated, water cellars should be built, water should be stored to prevent drought; small reservoirs should be built on the tributaries of the Mang River to intercept floods and develop irrigation; in low-lying and flood-prone areas, drainage ditches should be dug, ditch-terrace fields should be built, and suitable crops should be changed to be planted; for the Mang River itself, control gates should be built to use it for power generation, flood diversion, and irrigation. The main method to achieve this plan is to resolutely rely on the masses.
    With a clear direction and specific methods, the remaining question was to mobilize the entire Party and all the masses to march toward nature. However, the peasant masses, who had lived under the long-term rule of the feudal system, lacked the habit of carrying out large-scale basic construction projects. They did not believe that it could be done, let alone that it could be done well. They even held a fatalistic attitude, saying, "Born in Jiyuan County, destined to suffer, any method is in vain." On the other hand, the small-scale peasant economy also greatly restricted the construction cause.
    "Peasants are realists." The Jiyuan County Committee firmly grasped this characteristic of the masses and decided to conduct different pilot projects in different types of areas. Leading cadres, led by the County Party Secretary, went deep into key areas, personally took action, created experiences, set examples, organized visits, and then gradually promoted them. The pilot process was a process of educating and mobilizing the masses, and also a process of sharp struggle between advanced ideas and conservative ideas, individual interests and collective interests. This was most prominently manifested in the construction of the first small reservoir—the Nanyao Reservoir. Nanyao Village is located in the upper reaches of the Shipan River. During droughts, the ditches and rivers are dry, and during the flood season, mountain floods erupt, washing away land and houses. The masses of Nanyao Village urgently demanded to eradicate water and drought disasters. However, when the county decided to first build a reservoir here, it encountered many obstacles. On the one hand, the masses resisted the idea, fearing that the water would be too large to hold back and would wash away the village, and fearing that they would not be able to store water during droughts and would waste their labor. On the other hand, the small-scale peasant economy posed limitations. The masses in the west of the village feared that they would not be able to use the water and were unwilling to collect materials. The masses in the east of the village feared that their land would be occupied and were unwilling to start construction. At this time, the Jiyuan County Committee and the Nanyao Village Branch mobilized the masses to talk about the suffering of drought disasters and calculate the benefits of increased production. They also made a model of the reservoir to explain to the masses the principle and function of the reservoir. Finally, they let the masses elect representatives to visit the small reservoirs in Yichuan County. The representatives personally saw the production-increasing effect of the small reservoirs in Yichuan and publicized it to the masses. The concerns of the masses were dispelled, and they began construction. After several stoppages and restarts, the county's first small reservoir was finally completed in the spring of the following year. The reservoir was filled with water that year and irrigated more than 3,000 mu of land, increasing grain production by more than 100 jin per mu. The County Party Committee timely organized the masses of the entire county to visit the Nanyao Reservoir, and all the concerns and doubts of the masses disappeared from then on. In the winter of that year, Wanghu, Chengliu and other villages successively built seven small reservoirs. At the same time, the pilot work of water cellars and arc-shaped terraces in Gengzhang Township, closing mountains for afforestation and planting trees in Libazhuang, ditch-terrace fields in Matou Village, well-digging in Guanqiao, and changing to planting rice in Shuitun have all successively gained experience and received benefits. Although, due to the various restrictions of the small-scale peasant economy on investment, land occupation, and the use of labor, during this period from 1952 to 1955, the various water conservancy projects were generally still in a scattered state. However, due to the attention to typical demonstrations, organized visits, and a series of publicity and education work, a good ideological foundation was prepared for the subsequent large-scale water conservancy construction movement.
    In the winter of 1955, the Mang River basin realized agricultural cooperation. The socialist collective economy opened up broad prospects for large-scale farmland water conservancy construction. According to this situation, the Jiyuan County Committee put forward a new task to the people of the county: "Eliminate drought disasters in five years, eliminate flood disasters in two years, and green the entire territory in seven years." The new situation and tasks inspired the vast people of the county. From the Taihang Mountains in the north to the Yellow River in the south, a vigorous water conservancy construction upsurge was set off. The upsurge brought many new problems. The problem of insufficient technical force was particularly serious. At that time, there were only three water conservancy technicians in the county, while the masses reported that they wanted to build more than 100 small reservoirs, more than 1,000 brick wells, more than 10,000 water cellars, and countless canals and culverts. Such a large-scale water conservancy construction task could not be met even if there were thirty water conservancy technicians, let alone only three. What should be done? The Jiyuan County Committee believed that the only way was to train troops on the spot, impart technology to the vast number of cadres and masses, and let the cadres and masses master the technology themselves. Therefore, the County Party Committee put forward the slogan of "cadres becoming technical" and designated Deputy County Chief Li Chuanqing to be responsible. Taking the Sanhe Reservoir as the focus, they adopted the method of using the construction site as a school, the project as teaching material, and teaching, learning, and doing at the same time. In one month, they trained 98 farmer technicians on the spot. In addition, they also used the same method to train more than 100 well-digging technicians, more than 1,000 water cellar technicians, more than 400 lime-burning technicians, and more than 3,800 rammer workers. This batch of technical forces that grew up from practical work played a decisive role in the widespread development of various water conservancy construction projects.
    Large-scale water conservancy construction requires a large number of materials, funds, and labor, which must be solved by the masses themselves. At the beginning of the project, the Jiyuan County Committee paid attention to publicizing and implementing the policy of "mainly run by the people, supplemented by government assistance," mobilizing the masses to find tricks, tap potential, raise funds and materials, obtain materials locally, and process them locally, so as to solve the difficulties of insufficient funds, materials, and labor. According to statistics, in the total investment of the 100 small reservoirs that have been built in the county, the funds raised by the masses accounted for more than 70%. As for well-digging, water cellar construction, canal repairs, and afforestation projects, no material subsidies from the state were required.
    The water conservancy construction in Jiyuan County has achieved remarkable results. Here, ordinary drought and flood disasters have been basically eliminated, and agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production has developed by leaps and bounds. The total grain output of the county increased from 98 million jin in 1952 to 197.7 million jin in 1956, 180,000 mu of trees have become timber, and the number of cattle and sheep has increased three to four times. Under these circumstances, some right-leaning conservative ideas have emerged among some cadres and masses, who believe that water conservancy construction has been done almost enough and are unwilling to continue to work hard. For example, Zizhong Township already has 12 reservoirs, which can irrigate 9,400 mu of land, and they are unwilling to dig wells anymore. Another example is that the ditch-terrace fields in the Matou Township area can yield 400 jin per mu without fertilizer, so some people don't want to accumulate fertilizer. Others believe that the easy projects have all been done, and the remaining ones are not easy to do. They are afraid of difficulties and lack confidence, and they have the idea of relying on the state. The Jiyuan County Committee promptly discovered this problem and timely convened an enlarged four-level cadre meeting for the entire county. Then, they led the masses of the entire county to launch a major debate centered on water conservancy construction, asking whether there was too much or not enough water conservancy construction? Is it necessary to continue to expand in the future? Should the difficulties be solved by relying on the state or by relying on the masses themselves? After presenting the facts and reasoning, right-leaning conservative ideas were gradually overcome. The original plan for Zizhong Township to build water cellars was 500, which was later revised to 800. Finally, after the masses reported themselves, it reached more than 1,700. The water conservancy construction plans of other townships and communes were also revised time and time again, and broken through by the actual actions of the masses time and time again. Now, there are 78 reservoirs under construction in the county, more than 4,300 water cellars, 450 water wells, more than 200 newly built and renovated rivers and canals, 10,000 mu of afforestation, and 500,000 trees planted....
    A new upsurge of water conservancy construction has once again formed in Jiyuan County.

    依靠群众　战胜自然
    ——中共济源县委领导水利建设的经验
              本报记者　商恺
    许多人都想知道河南济源县领导水利建设的经验，为此，我访问了中共济源县委会。县委书记赵世珉同志告诉我说：这里边并没有什么奥秘，只不过是党抓住了群众的要求，充分地发动了群众，又紧紧地依靠了群众，上下一股劲，一齐向大自然展开了进攻。
    济源县的自然特点是山区苦旱，平原苦涝。广大群众对保土蓄水、治水排水的要求都非常迫切，在历届县人民代表大会上，关于治理漭河的提案很多，这使县委必须从根本上来考虑全面治理旱涝灾害的问题。
    问题怎样解决呢？这对当时刚刚由领导阶级斗争转入领导生产斗争的济源县委来说，还是一个新问题。既没经验，又没办法。但是，济源县委并没有被困难吓住，他们一面号召群众“人人献计策，个个出主意”，一面以县委书记为首，分头上山下乡，访问群众，调查研究，寻求办法。在山区虎岭一带，他们看到有些山头上长起了林木，披满了草坡，水土流失现象已经停止。在丘陵地区，他们发现有些群众用土窖存储雨水，够一年的吃用。天旱时，下冶村有个名叫赵官义的农民，用窖水浇了二亩玉米，每亩收了二百四十多斤。在耿章乡，他们发现有许多人仿照孟县劳动模范赵新泽的办法，把梯田修成了周边高里边低的弧形梯田，田面上还加筑了拦泥用的土埂；经过观测，证明这样的梯田蓄水保墒能力很高。在河沟港岔，他们看到大量的雨水被白白地流走了，联想起伊川县修建小型蓄水库拦洪灌溉的好经验。在低洼地区，他们发现有的群众改种水稻或修筑沟洫台田，都获得了丰收。这些，济源县委认为都是群众创造出来的抵抗旱涝灾害的好办法，在许多地方进行了推广。但是，当时却没有把它们联系起来作全盘的考虑。比如，在丘陵地区打土窖，便只想到了蓄水抗旱，没有想到它还可以控制坡面流水，减少山下水害。又如，在山区只注意了封山育林能保持水土，没考虑到留出牧场发展畜牧，造成了林牧矛盾。后来，县委学习了国家治理淮河的经验，领导思想这才豁然开朗。他们说：淮河能搞大流域规划，我们为什么不可以搞小流域规划？淮河能修大工程，我们为什么不可以修小工程？淮河主要靠国家投资，我们为什么不可以发动群众，依靠群众来治理？于是他们把各方面的治理经验联系起来，作出了综合治理漭河的全面规划。按照这个规划：在山区要植树造林和封山育林，培护草坡，控制水土流失；在岭岗坡地，要普遍整修梯田，打水窖纲，蓄水防旱，在漭河支流上要兴建小型水库，拦蓄洪水发展灌溉；在低洼易涝地区，要挖排水渠，修筑沟洫台田，改种适应作物；对漭河本身，要修节制闸，利用它发电分洪和灌溉。实现这个规划的主要方法，是坚决依靠群众。
    有了明确的方针和具体的办法，剩下的问题便是动员全党和全体群众，向大自然进军了。但是，在长期的封建制度统治下生活过来的农民群众，对于大规模地进行各项基本建设工程还缺乏习惯，不相信能办到，更不相信能办好，甚至抱着宿命论的态度，说什么“生在济源县，命该受熬煎，想什么办法也枉然。”另一方面，小农经济也给建设事业很大的限制。
    “农民是现实主义者”，济源县委紧紧地掌握住了群众这一特点，决定在不同类型的地区，进行不同的试点，以县委书记为首的领导干部，深入重点，亲自动手，创造经验，作出样子，组织参观，然后逐步推广。试点的过程，是教育和发动群众的过程，也是先进思想和保守思想、个人利益和集体利益尖锐斗争的过程。这在修建第一座小型水库——南姚水库的时候，表现的最为突出。南姚村在石盘河的上游。天旱时沟干河涸，汛期山洪暴发，冲地冲房。南姚村的群众迫切要求根治水旱灾害，但是当县里决定首先在这里修建水库的时候，却遇到了重重障碍。一方面是群众思想上的抵触，怕水大拦不住，冲了村子，怕天旱蓄不上水，白费工。一方面是小农经济的限制，村西头的群众怕自己用不上水，不愿凑料，村东头的群众怕占用自己的土地，不愿动工。这时候，济源县委和南姚村支部便发动群众诉旱灾苦、算增产账，并制作了水库模型，向群众讲清楚水库的原理和作用，最后又让群众选派代表，去参观伊川县的小型水库。代表们亲眼看到了伊川小水库的增产效果，回来向群众作了宣传，群众的顾虑打消了，这才动起工来。中间经过几度停工和开工，到第二年春天，全县第一座小水库才算全部竣工。这座水库当年就蓄满了水，当年就浇了三千多亩地，每亩增产粮食一百多斤。县委及时组织全县群众到南姚水库参观，群众的一切顾虑怀疑，从此烟消云散。就在这年冬天，王虎、承留等村，接连修起了七座小水库。和这同时，耿章乡的水窖和弧形梯田、李八庄的封山育林和植树造林、马头村的沟洫台田、官桥的打井、水屯的改种水稻等试点工作，都先后取得了经验，收到了效益。虽然由于小农经济在投资、占地、使用劳力上的种种限制，从1952年到1955年的这一段时间里，各项水利工程一般说来都还处在星星点点的状态中，但由于注意了典型示范、组织参观等一系列地宣传教育工作，就为以后大规模的水利建设运动准备好了思想基础。
    1955年冬季，漭河流域实现了农业合作化，社会主义的集体经济为大规模的兴修农田水利事业开辟了广阔的前途。济源县委根据这一形势，向全县人民提出了新的任务：“五年消灭旱灾，二年消灭涝灾，七年绿化全境。”新的形势和任务，鼓舞了全县广大人民，北起太行山，南到黄河边，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的水利建设高潮。高潮带来了许多新的问题。技术力量不足的问题特别严重。当时全县只有三个水利技术员，而群众自报要修建的小型水库就有一百多座，砖井一千多眼，水窖一万余个，渠道、桥涵无从统计。这样大规模的水利建设任务，不要说只有三个水利技术员，就是三十个也不能满足需要。怎么办呢？济源县委认为，唯一的办法就是就地练兵，把技术传授给广大干部和群众，让干部和群众自己掌握技术。于是县委提出了“干部技术化”的口号，并指定副县长李传清同志负责，以三合水库为重点，采取以工地为学校，以工程为教材，边教边学边作的方法，用了一个月的时间，就地训练了九十八名农民技术员。另外，还采取同样的方法，训练了一百多名打井技术员，一千多名水窖技术员，四百多名烧石灰的技术员，还有三千八百多名硪工。这批从实际工作中生长起来的技术力量，对各项水利建设工程的普遍开展起了决定性的作用。
    大规模的水利建设，需要大批的物料、资金和劳力，这必须依靠群众自己去解决。济源县委在工程一开始，便注意宣传贯彻“民办为主，政府扶助为辅”的方针，发动群众找窍门，挖潜力，集资凑料，就地取材，就地加工，解决资金物料和劳力不足的困难。据统计，在全县已建成的一百座小型水库的总投资中，群众自筹的就占到70％以上，至于打井、打水窖、修渠、造林等工程，更没有要国家任何物质上的补助。
    济源县的水利建设已收到了显著的效果。在这里，普通的旱涝灾害已经基本消灭，农业、林业、畜牧业生产有了飞跃发展。全县粮食总产量由1952年的九千八百万斤提高到1956年的一亿九千七百万斤，林木已有十八万亩成材，牛羊增加了三倍到四倍。在这种情况下，部分干部和群众中产生了一些右倾保守思想，认为水利建设搞得差不多了，不愿再艰苦奋斗了。如子中乡已有了十二座水库，能浇九千四百亩地，便不愿再打井了；又如马头乡一带的沟洫台田不施肥料，每亩就能收到四百斤，因而有些群众就不想积肥了，还有的认为好作的工程都作完了，剩下的都不好搞了，畏惧困难，信心不足，产生了依靠国家的思想。济源县委及时发现了这一问题，及时召开了全县四级扩大干部会议，接着领导全县群众以水利建设为中心展开了大辩论，提出水利建设是多了呢还是不够？今后还需要不需要继续扩大？有困难是依靠国家还是依靠群众自己解决？经过摆事实，讲道理，右倾保守思想被逐步克服。子中乡打水窖的计划，开始定的是五百个，后来修订为八百个，最后经过群众自报，达到了一千七百多个。其他各乡各社的水利建设计划，也是一次一次地修订，一次一次地为群众的实际行动所突破。现在，全县动工兴建的水库已有七十八座、水窖四千三百多个，水井四百五十眼，新修和整修河渠二百多条，造林一万亩，植树五十万株……。
    一个新的水利建设高潮又在济源县形成了。
