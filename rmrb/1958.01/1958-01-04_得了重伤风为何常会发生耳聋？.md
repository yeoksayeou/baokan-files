Why does hearing loss often occur after a severe cold?

People are most susceptible to catching colds during seasonal changes (especially in winter). A more severe case is what people generally call a severe cold. This condition is medically known as acute rhinitis because clinical examinations reveal that the mucous membrane inside the patient's nasal cavity exhibits acute inflammation and swelling.

But why does a severe cold affect the ears and cause hearing loss?

The reason is that there is a passage connecting the nose and the ear, called the Eustachian tube. Normally, it sends air from the nasal cavity to the middle ear to balance the air pressure inside the middle ear with the atmospheric pressure, which is necessary to maintain normal hearing. Once the Eustachian tube is blocked, the middle ear becomes isolated from the nasal cavity, air cannot circulate, and the air originally present in the middle ear cavity gradually becomes thinner due to absorption by the mucous membrane. The pressure slowly decreases, eventually resulting in a negative pressure (vacuum), or even a vacuum state, meaning it is lower than the external air pressure. At this point, the eardrum will be drawn inward and collapse, fluid will accumulate in the middle ear, and it will be unable to transmit sound waves to the inner ear. The person will feel deafness, hearing loss, and may even experience tinnitus and headaches.

During a severe cold, the nasal mucosa has acute inflammation, and swelling often extends to the Eustachian tube. The blockage of the passage causes the aforementioned series of pathological changes.

If this type of hearing loss is not treated promptly, it may sometimes result in lifelong disability. The best approach is, of course, to avoid severe colds. If you already have a severe cold, you should seek treatment promptly. The key is to reduce swelling of the nasal mucosa and reduce the chance of Eustachian tube blockage. Instilling a 1% ephedrine solution or nasal spray into the nasal cavity can reduce mucosal swelling and reduce nasal congestion. In addition, avoid blowing your nose forcefully; gargling with saline or disinfectant solution to maintain oral and pharyngeal hygiene may also prevent inflammation from affecting the Eustachian tube.

专栏：为什么？

    得了重伤风为何常会发生耳聋？
    人在季节变化（特别是冬季）时最容易着凉感冒。厉害一些的，就是一般人所谓重伤风了。这种病在医学上又叫急性鼻炎，因为临床检查，发现病人鼻腔里的粘膜呈现急性炎症，并有肿胀现象。
    可是重伤风为什么会波及耳朵，使听觉失聪呢？
    原来鼻与耳之间有一个管道相通。这个管名叫欧氏管。平时，它从鼻腔把空气送入中耳，使中耳里的气压与大气压平衡，才能维持人的正常听力。一旦欧氏管被堵塞，中耳就与鼻腔隔绝，空气便不能流通，原存在中耳腔里的空气因被粘膜所吸收而渐渐稀薄了，压力慢慢降低，最后呈现负压状态（阴压），甚至呈现真空状态，也就是说小于外界气压。这时，耳膜就会被吸引向内塌陷，中耳里产生液体，无法把音波传到内耳，人就觉得耳背、耳聋，甚至还会感到耳鸣和头痛。
    在重伤风时，鼻粘膜有急性炎症，肿胀往往延及欧氏管。管道被堵塞，所以发生上述一系列的病理变化。
    这种耳聋若不及时治疗，有时可能造成终生残疾。最好的办法当然是避免重伤风。已经重伤风了，就应及时治疗。要紧的是使鼻腔粘膜消肿，减少欧氏管堵塞的机会。用百分之一的麻黄素液或鼻通滴入鼻腔，能使粘膜消肿，减少鼻腔堵塞。此外，勿用力擤鼻；用食盐水或消毒药水漱口，保持口腔及咽部卫生，欧氏管也就可能不受炎症波及。
