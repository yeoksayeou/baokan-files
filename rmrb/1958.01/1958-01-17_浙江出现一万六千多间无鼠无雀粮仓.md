Xinhua News Agency report:

    Zhejiang Province has reported over 16,000 rat-free and sparrow-free granaries. In counties like Yuhang, Lin'an, and Yuqian, over 90% of the granaries now show no signs of rats or sparrows on the grain surfaces, and the granaries have no rat holes or sparrow nests. It is estimated that the province has reduced the loss of over 18 million jin of grain for the country in the past year.
    In the "Four-Without" granary campaign launched last year, thousands of granary workers in Zhejiang Province paid special attention to rat and sparrow extermination work. Grain warehouse keepers in various places devised many methods to eliminate rats and sparrows. Zhang Ziwei, a warehouse keeper in Ningbo City, adopted the "Four Diligences" rat-catching method: diligent inspection, diligent bait replacement, diligent setting of rat traps, and diligent searching for rat paths. He has caught over 1,000 rats in the past year.

    浙江出现一万六千多间无鼠无雀粮仓
    新华社讯　浙江省出现了一万六千多间无鼠无雀粮仓。余杭、临安、于潜等县现在已经做到90％以上的粮仓粮面无鼠迹雀象，仓房无鼠洞雀巢。估计一年来全省共为国家减少一千八百多万斤粮食的损失。
    浙江省几千名粮仓职工去年在开展“四无”粮仓运动中，特别注意捕鼠灭雀工作。各地粮仓保管员想出了许多消灭鼠雀的办法。宁波市仓库保管员张自伟采取“四勤”捕鼠法：勤检查、勤换饵、勤架鼠夹、勤找鼠路，一年来共捕鼠一千多只。
