Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 17th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a foreign policy speech at the National Press Club on the 16th and subsequently held a press conference. In his speech and press conference, he reiterated the U.S. reluctance to hold a summit meeting and demanded that the American people make "necessary efforts and sacrifices" to support the government's massive nuclear arms expansion plan.

Dulles vigorously poured cold water on the unprecedentedly loud calls from both within the United States and abroad for East-West talks. While he pretended to say that "there is room for negotiation," he immediately emphasized that believing a summit meeting could end the "Cold War" was "a long-held human delusion," and that "peace will never be achieved in this way."

He said, "If we think that by heads of government announcing a set of platitudes about peace at a summit meeting, all our dangers will be eliminated, and act on that belief, then nothing could be more foolish." Because in that case, the people of Western countries would "no longer be willing to support military and economic aid programs," which would cause "various inconveniences" to the Western alliance, and the people of these countries would think that "peace has been declared, and all these things can be thrown away."

United Press International reporter Gonzalez said that Dulles's speech was an "elaboration" of Eisenhower's reply to Bulganin and a "new international warning" against hastily "conducting any ill-prepared meetings" with the Soviet Union.

In the opening part of his speech, Dulles acknowledged that the launching of Soviet artificial satellites marked "a decisive turning point" in the world balance of power, and that the socialist camp had "undoubtedly achieved a victory." The Soviet Union's "industrial strength is constantly growing," and its potential is "not to be underestimated." However, Dulles described this as "a more powerful challenge" facing the "free world" and used it to demand that the American people make "necessary efforts and sacrifices" to support the U.S.'s "countermeasures." The first of these so-called "countermeasures" is to "maintain a strong, balanced military force, including a permanent and ever-ready retaliatory force." The other items include economic penetration of newly independent countries and promoting the American way of life.

At the press conference, someone asked Dulles what the U.S.'s goal for its current policy toward China was. He replied that it was to serve so-called "enlightened American interests." He said, "Any time it is advantageous to the United States to recognize the Chinese Communist regime, we will do so. If there is no benefit, then we will not recognize it, and the current answer is that there is no benefit." Dulles also expressed opposition to China's participation in a summit meeting.

### 杜勒斯力竭声嘶反对谈判  要美国人民为核扩军作出牺牲

    杜勒斯力竭声嘶反对谈判
    要美国人民为核扩军作出牺牲
    据新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯16日在全国新闻俱乐部发表外交政策演说，并且随后举行了记者招待会。他在演说和记者招待会中重申美国不愿意举行最高级会议的态度，并且要求美国人民作出“必需的努力和牺牲”来支持政府的庞大的核扩军计划。
    杜勒斯竭力向美国国内外要求东西方会谈的空前响亮的呼声泼冷水。他虽然也假惺惺地说“谈判的余地是有的”，但是，他接着就强调说，认为在最高级会议上可以结束“冷战”是“长期以来人类所抱有的一种幻想”，“和平决不会通过这种方法求得”。
    他说，“假如我们认为，通过政府首脑在最高级会议上宣布一套和平的陈词滥调，我们的一切危险就可以消除，并且根据这种信念来采取行动，那就是再愚蠢不过的事了。”因为这样西方国家的人民就“不再愿意支持军事计划和经济援助计划”，这样就会给西方联盟造成“种种不便”，这些国家的人民就会认为“已经宣告了和平，所有这些东西都可以扔掉了”。
    合众社记者冈萨雷斯说，杜勒斯的演说是对艾森豪威尔给布尔加宁的复信的“发挥”，是一个“新的国际警告”，告诫不要仓促同苏联“进行任何准备不充分的会议”。
    杜勒斯在他的演说开头部分承认苏联人造卫星上天标志着世界力量对比的“一个决定性的转折点”，社会主义阵营“无疑得到了一个胜利”。苏联的“工业力量不断增长”，它的潜力是“不可轻侮”的。但是，杜勒斯把这说成是“自由世界”面临的“更加有力的一种挑战”，并且借此要求美国人民作出“必需的努力和牺牲”来支持美国的“对策”。他所谓的这种“对策”的第一项就是“保持一种强大的、均衡的军事力量，包括一支永远存在的和永远戒备的报复力量”。其他几项包括对新独立国家经济渗入和推销美国生活方式等。
    在记者招待会上，有人问杜勒斯美国对中国现行政策的目标是什么。他回答说是为所谓“开明的美国利益服务”。他说，“任何时候，只要承认中国共产党政权对美国是有利的，那我们就会那样作。如果没有好处，那我们就不承认，而目前的答案是没有好处。”杜勒斯还表示反对中国参加最高级会议。
