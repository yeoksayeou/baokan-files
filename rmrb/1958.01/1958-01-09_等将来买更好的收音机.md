    Waiting to Buy a Better Radio in the Future
    I love drama and music. But in this remote mountainous area, it is not easy to see a good play. Therefore, I can only pin my hopes on the radio. To buy a radio, I have been saving my small monthly wage surplus, accumulating one hundred yuan over two years. After the publication of the 1958 National Economic Construction Bond Regulations in the newspaper, the idea of buying a radio started turning in my mind. After repeated considerations, I have now decided to use this money to buy bonds to support national economic construction. Because I know that when industry is developed in the future, the country will be able to produce more and better radios to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. Moreover, isn't it a win-win situation to save this money now and buy cheaper and better goods in the future! I plan to save another one hundred yuan this year in addition to these one hundred yuan in savings. Added together, I can buy two hundred yuan worth of economic construction bonds.

    等将来买更好的收音机
    我喜爱戏剧音乐。但在这偏僻的山区，不容易看上一场好戏。因此，只能把希望寄托在收音机上。为了买收音机，我把每月很少的一点工资余额积存起来，两年来积下了一百块钱。1958年国家经济建设公债条例在报上公布以后，买收音机这个念头就开始在我的脑子里打开了转转。经过三番五次的考虑，我现在决定把这笔钱用来买公债，支援国家经济建设。因为我知道将来工业发达了，国家就能造出更多更精美的收音机来，满足广大人民的需要。再说，现在能把这笔钱省下来，将来去买价廉物美的，这岂不是两全其美吗！我计划除这一百元积蓄外，今年还可节约一百元，加在一起，我就可以买二百元的经济建设公债。
