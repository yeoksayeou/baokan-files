Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st – In Zhejiang Province, rice grown in paddy fields cultivated with double-wheel double-share plows has seen significant increases in production.

In 1956, fifty-two production units in Zhejiang Province conducted comparative experiments under the same conditions, using double-wheel double-share plows and traditional plows. The results showed that land cultivated with double-wheel double-share plows increased rice production by about 10%. Furthermore, according to the practices of fifty-six agricultural cooperatives and farms across the province in 1957, rice cultivated with double-wheel double-share plows increased by an average of 12.82%. In Huangyan County, more than 50,000 mu of land cultivated with double-wheel double-share plows yielded higher outputs than those cultivated with traditional plows. The farms in this county produced 483 jin of rice per mu using double-wheel double-share plows, compared to 419 jin per mu using traditional plows. The Xin Xing Agricultural Cooperative in Jinhua County saw an increase of 113.25 jin of rice per mu when using double-wheel double-share plows compared to traditional plows.

In areas where the double-wheel double-share plow has proven effective, farmers have praised it extensively. Farmers in the Xinhe District of Wenling County reported that the double-wheel double-share plow has "seven advantages" (stable, deep, level, fast, even soil turning, fine soil crushing, and good grass covering) and "four savings" (saving labor, saving animal power, saving time, and saving effort). According to experiments at the Shuangqiao Farm in Jiaxing County, the cultivation efficiency of one double-wheel double-share plow is equivalent to two to three traditional plows.

Zhejiang Province began to focus on experimenting with double-wheel double-share plows in paddy field areas in 1954, and expanded to multi-point trials in 1955. After experimentation, modifications were made to the original double-wheel double-share plow, replacing the iron wheels with wooden wheels and adding plowshare covers and auxiliary plow blades. The modified double-wheel double-share plow can be used in most areas of the province and is welcomed by farmers. By the end of last year, more than 36,500 double-wheel double-share plows had been promoted throughout the province.

    双轮双铧犁有“七好”“四省”
    浙江农场和农业社用它耕种水田普遍增产
    新华社杭州21日电　浙江省水田地区凡是用双轮双铧犁耕作的水稻，都获得显著增产。
    1956年，浙江省有五十二个生产单位在相同的条件下，用双轮双铧犁和土犁进行对比试验的结果，凡使用双轮双铧犁的地，水稻增产一成左右；又根据1957年全省五十六个农业社和农场的实践，用双轮双铧犁耕作的水稻，平均增产12.82％。黄岩县有五万多亩田用双轮双铧犁耕作，产量都比用土犁耕作的高。这个县的农场用双轮双铧犁耕的田，每亩产稻四百八十三斤；用土犁耕的田，每亩产稻四百一十九斤。金华县新星农业社用双轮双铧犁耕作的水稻，比用土犁耕作的增产一百一十三点二五斤。
    在使用双轮双铧犁获得成效的地区，农民对双轮双铧犁称赞不已。温岭县新河区农民反映：双轮双铧犁有七好（稳、深、平、快、翻土匀、碎土细、盖草好），四省（省劳力、省畜力、省时间、省力气）。据嘉兴县双桥农场试验，一部双轮双铧犁的耕作效率相当两部到三部土犁。
    浙江省从1954年起就开始有重点地试验双轮双铧犁在水田地区的耕作问题，到1955年就扩大到多点试验。经过试验，对原有的双轮双铧犁进行了改装，把铁轮改木轮，加装犁头套和辅助犁壁。改装后的双轮双铧犁，在全省大部地区都能使用，受到农民欢迎。到去年止，全省已推广双轮双铧犁三万六千五百多部。
