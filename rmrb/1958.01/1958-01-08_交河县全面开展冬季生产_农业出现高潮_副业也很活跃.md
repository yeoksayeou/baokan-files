    Jiaocheng County Fully Launches Winter Production
    Agricultural Production Reaches a Climax; Sideline Occupations Are Also Very Active
    (Our newspaper reports) Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, has made overall arrangements for agricultural and sideline production. Not only has winter agricultural production formed a climax, but sideline production is also very active.
    In agricultural production, starting from late October 1957, water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, wheat field management, and winter plowing have successively set off mass upsurges. By December 14th, the county had dug 193 canals (excavating 630,000 cubic meters of earth), built more than 3,700 new brick wells, and repaired 2,000 old wells. Labor invested in water conservancy construction accounted for 40% of the total labor force. Labor invested in manure accumulation accounted for 25% of the total labor force, and 1.8 million cartloads of fertilizer have been accumulated, averaging more than 2,400 catties per mu. More than 160,000 mu of wheat fields have been watered, accounting for 70% of the county's total wheat fields. More than 620,000 mu of land have been winter-plowed, accounting for 90% of the land to be cultivated.
    At the same time, sideline production has also been carried out relatively actively. There are more than 40 types of sideline production in the county, including raising livestock, fishing, pasting matchboxes, transportation, making shoe soles, weaving, cotton processing, and sweeping niter soil. Among the sideline production activities, the greatest achievement is the increase in raising small livestock and poultry, which can both accumulate fertilizer and increase the income of commune members. Every household is engaged in it, and every commune is very enthusiastic. At the end of October, the county had 30,000 pigs; now it has grown to 70,000, averaging 1.08 pigs per household. It is expected that the task of developing 100,000 to 120,000 pigs can be completed before the Spring Festival. Communes with better sideline production not only increased the income of commune members but also strongly supported water conservancy construction and agricultural production. Zhouzhuang Agricultural Cooperative used its sideline income to buy two waterwheels and ten water buckets. The sideline income of Huozhuang Agricultural Cooperative not only supported production but also solved the clothing and pocket money problems for most of the commune members. The commune members happily said, "Their commune has four autumns a year (meaning that in addition to the wheat harvest and autumn harvest, there are two sideline income dividends)."
    Why can Jiaocheng County achieve both agricultural and sideline production without neglecting either?
    1. The leadership attaches importance to it, makes overall arrangements, and assigns special personnel to be in charge and be responsible at all levels. The Jiaocheng County Party Committee deeply accepted the lessons of neglecting sideline production in 1956. In late October, arrangements were made for sideline production at the three-level cadre meeting, criticizing some cadres who feared that engaging in sideline production would divert energy from water conservancy and manure accumulation movements. It was emphasized that agricultural and sideline production must be combined with each other, and one cannot be grasped and the other be lost. Counties, districts, and townships all designated special personnel to be responsible. The county party committee and work teams going to the countryside paid attention to checking and supervising the combination of agricultural and sideline occupations, and the development of sideline occupations.
    2. Fully mobilize the masses and strengthen education for cooperative and team cadres and the broad masses. Specific arrangements were made for agricultural work, labor, and time. For sideline occupations suitable for collective operation by cooperatives and teams, fixed labor was used to engage in them; for household sideline occupations and scattered, sporadic ones suitable for commune members to operate, women, semi-laborers, or commune members were mobilized to carry them out in their spare time.
    3. Reasonably solve the problem of work points and remuneration. The labor remuneration for commune members participating in sideline production is generally based on the amount of income to assess work points. Appropriate rewards were given to commune members with specialized skills. The cooperative does not control auxiliary labor; after the labor participating in the cooperative's production completes its assigned tasks, it can engage in household sideline production. This has stimulated the enthusiasm of commune members for production.

### 交河县全面开展冬季生产  农业出现高潮　副业也很活跃

    交河县全面开展冬季生产
    农业出现高潮　副业也很活跃
    本报讯　河北省交河县对农、副业生产进行了统筹安排，不仅冬季农业生产形成高潮，副业生产也很活跃。
    在农业生产上，从1957年10月下旬开始，水利建设、积肥、麦田管理和冬耕一个接一个地掀起了群众性的高潮。到12月14日，全县已挖成水渠一百九十三条，（挖土六十三万公方），打成新砖井三千七百多眼，修旧井二千眼。投入水利建设的劳力占劳力总数的40％。投入积肥的劳力占劳力总数的25％，已经积肥一百八十万车，平均每亩二千四百多斤。已浇麦田十六万多亩，占全县麦田总数70％。全县已冬耕地六十二万多亩，占应耕地90％。
    在同时，副业生产也开展得比较活跃。全县已有饲养，捕鱼，糊火柴盒，运输，纳鞋底，编织，棉花加工，扫硝土等四十多种，在副业生产中，以既能积肥，又能增加社员收入的增养小家畜家禽的成绩最大，家家户户都搞，社社都很火热。10月底，全县有猪三万只；现在已发展到七万只，平均每户一点零八只。预计到春节前即可完成发展十至十二万只的养猪任务。副业生产开展较好的社中，不仅增加了社员收入，更有力地支持了水利建设和农业生产。周庄农业社用副业收入买了两辆水车，十个水斗子。霍庄农业社的副业收入不仅支持了生产，还解决了绝大部分社员的穿衣和零花钱。社员们高兴地说：“他们社里一年有四个秋（意思是指一年除了麦秋、秋收外，还有两次副业分红）。
    交河县为什么能做到农、副业生产两不误呢？
    一、领导重视，统筹安排，专人分管、层层负责。交河县委深刻接受了1956年忽视副业生产的教训，10月下旬，在三级干部会上对副业生产就作了安排，批判了某些干部怕搞副业分散搞水利，积肥运动精力的思想，强调农副业生产必须相互结合，不能抓一个丢一个。县、区、乡都确定专人负责。下乡县委和工作组对农副业的结合、副业生产开展的情况，都注意检查督导。
    二、充分发动群众，加强对社、队干部和广大群众的教育。对农活、劳力、时间作了具体安排。对适宜社、队集体经营的副业，固定劳力，专门去搞；对社员家庭副业和分散零星的适合社员经营的，发动妇女半劳力或社员在业余时间去进行。
      三、合理解决记工付酬问题。对参加副业生产社员的劳动报酬，一般的是参照收入多少评定工分。对有专业技术的社员，适当地作了奖励。对辅助劳力社里不加控制；对参加社里生产的劳力在完成自己分担的任务以后，就可以自己去搞家庭副业生产。这样作，就激发了社员生产的积极性。
