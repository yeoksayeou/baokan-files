    Individualism and Cancer
    Zhang Guangnian
    Cancer—the most dangerous enemy of human health. I didn't know how terrible it was before. In the past two or three years, several respectable friends have been defeated by this enemy one after another. Thinking about it now, I feel very sorry. This enemy lurks deep inside the body and can lurk for a long time, cleverly evading the diagnosis of modern medicine. For a long time, the patient does not know that this deadly toxin is buried in his body. Even when the doctor diagnoses it, he is reluctant to tell him directly. By the time he discovers it himself and is still doubtful, the virus has already penetrated deep into the vital organs, developing malignantly in the key parts of the body, and even famous doctors can do nothing about it.
    In the recent political and ideological revolutionary struggle, we have seen another dangerous enemy, and its name is individualism. This is an extremely base and selfish disease. Like cancer, it lurks in the depths of some people's minds; compared to cancer, it is even more dangerous and terrible. Because the patient is not completely unaware of his own problems; the people around him have also pointed out his symptoms; but the patient avoids treatment for his illness, which makes the condition worse and worse. Some young people are infected with this disease, refuse treatment, and become uncontrollable. Some patients have been in the revolutionary ranks for twenty or thirty years, but they always hide their condition and do not have the determination to take strong measures. As a result of the malignant development of this virus, they become insane and become madmen against the Party and socialism. The cancerous tumor destroys a person's organic tissues; while the cancer of individualism, while destroying a person's political life, also causes great damage to the revolutionary cause. We will always feel sorry when a friend suffers from cancer. The malignant tumor of extreme individualism erupting on a person can only arouse our hatred.
    It is said that individualism had a glorious history in the anti-feudal struggle. I have heard this saying for a long time, but it still cannot be fully convinced. We don't know much about foreign countries. In our feudal society, the factors of resisting feudal oppression and pursuing individual liberation have long existed. In the past century, people with lofty ideals who opposed imperialism and feudalism have emerged one after another. However, the reason why these people with lofty ideals have won the love and respect of the people is primarily because they are people who are concerned about the country and the people, and who are selfless and forgetful of themselves. Although their world view cannot be said to be collectivist, it is completely different from the selfish and profit-seeking individualism. I do not deny that bourgeois individualism played a certain positive role in breaking down the barriers of the feudal system; but the good reputation of the bourgeoisie is also at the cost of the exploitation and bullying of the working people. The positive role of individualism in our history has obviously been exaggerated too much.
    Under the conditions in our country, even the tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism that belong to the category of bourgeois revolution—economically, politically, not to mention ideologically—bourgeois individualism is incapable of doing. Only the New Democratic Revolution led by the working class can overthrow the mountains that have been pressing on the people for a long time. And we have seen many examples of the bourgeoisie and the landlord class joining hands, and bourgeois ideas and feudal ideas burning incense and worshipping each other. Bourgeois individualism has even exposed its reactionary identity in the New Democratic Revolution. During the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, people like Luo Longji and Zeng Zhaolun used the banner of "democratic individualism" to engage in anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities. The Hu Feng Group raised the banner of individualism and individual liberation, and engaged in anti-Marxist and anti-people activities. We have not forgotten these things. Now that the revolution has entered the socialist stage, individualism has become a thorough poisonous weed; the individualistic toxins lurking in a revolutionary become terrible cancer cells, developing into a fatal terminal illness; it is not difficult to understand.
    I will not talk about those who are completely immersed in the poisonous juice of individualism for the time being. Even these people can find all the convenient conditions for disinfection and treatment in the new society, depending on whether he has the determination to transform himself. What I want to say is the individualistic toxins in many revolutionary intellectuals. It is most appropriate to say that it is private ownership in the mind. This is a strange disease brought from the exploiting class: always keeping their eyes wide open, wanting fame, profit, power, and very high enjoyment; always stretching out their hands, wanting to compete, to grab, to steal, to rob things that do not belong to him. These extremely despicable demands in the mind may be encouraged in the old society, but they will be criticized in the new society. Deeply hidden individualism is therefore linked to the old system and resented the new system. The root of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments lies here. If there is one point of individualism, that one point is incompatible with socialism and collectivism. If there are ten points of individualism, it is completely incompatible with socialism and collectivism. When individualism occupies a dominant position in a person, he feels that he is "unfree" everywhere in collective life, that his "individuality" is suppressed. According to the laws of class struggle, he must "struggle," "resist," "liberate his individuality," and "sacrifice himself for righteousness." When individualism develops malignantly, just like cancer reaching the outbreak stage, he will violently conflict with socialism and collectivism, and do all kinds of evil things.
    If cancer in a patient is discovered early, there are ways to treat it. The fear is that it cannot be discovered early. And the cancer of individualism, no matter how deeply hidden, the patient has some self-awareness. If you are willing to boldly expose it, dare to face it when others point out the symptoms, and rely on the help of the collective to eliminate it, then the possibility of turning misfortune into good fortune is entirely possible. The benefits of our collective life are also manifested here: it emphasizes mutual assistance and mutual love, treating illnesses and saving people. Once the root cause is removed, the private ownership in the mind is gone, and the subjective things are consistent with the laws of objective development, then you can experience the true freedom and true individual liberation after jumping out of the sickbed. Do not believe the deception of the rightist Xu Maoyong; he advocated maintaining "optimistic calmness" about ideological diseases, so-called "putting life and death aside," and letting it develop freely to the "extreme stage" of unconsciousness. It is said that this "will keep going to the right, and can also turn to the left"! Therefore, he wanted us to "also be calm" in the face of the rightist offensive, "and not to despair because the patient has a fever too violently" (see Xu Maoyong's article "The Extreme Stage"). However, Xu Maoyong's extreme individualism was because he refused to undergo surgery. After several "extreme stages," he only saw it "keep going to the right," but did not see it "turn to the left." In a recent extremely frantic "extreme stage," all the cancer toxins in the body erupted together, becoming a rightist who refused to turn back. Xu Maoyong's "extreme stage" theory could not deceive others, but it harmed himself. This should be taken as a warning.

    个人主义与癌
    张光年
    癌——人类健康最危险的敌人。我从前不知道它的厉害。最近两三年间，几位可尊敬的朋友，接二连三地被这个敌人打倒了。现在一想起来就感到痛惜。这个敌人在身体内部潜藏很深，也能潜藏很久，能够很狡猾地躲过现代医学的诊断。病人长期间不知道自己体内埋藏着这个致命的毒素。大夫诊断出来，也不忍直接告诉他。等到他自己发现而又将信将疑的时候，那病毒早已深入膏肓，在身体的要害部门恶性地发展起来，虽有名医，也无所措手了。
    在最近的一场政治上、思想上的革命斗争中，我们看到了另一个危险的敌人，它的名字叫个人主义。这是一种极其卑污的自私病。像癌一样，它潜藏在一些人心灵的深处；比起癌来，它更要危险和可怕得多。因为患病的人，对自己的毛病不是毫无自觉；周围的人，也不是没有指出他的病象；而患者讳病忌医，就使病情越变越沉重起来。有些年青人染上了这种病，拒绝医疗，一发而不可收拾。有些病人在革命队伍里混了二三十年，却总是隐瞒自己的病情，没有痛下针砭的决心，这病毒恶性发展的结果，竟使他丧心病狂，成为反党、反社会主义的狂人。癌的毒瘤，破坏的是一个人的机体组织；而个人主义的癌，在毁坏了一个人政治生命的同时，还给革命事业造成很大的损害。一个朋友患了癌症，永远引起我们的痛惜。一个人身上的极端个人主义的恶性瘤发作了，却只能引起我们的痛恨。
    据说，个人主义在反封建斗争中，曾经有过光荣的历史。听到这说法已经很久了，到底还不能使人完全信服。外国如何，我们知道的不多。在我国封建社会中，反抗封建压迫、追求个性解放的因素是长期存在的。近百年来，反帝、反封建的仁人志士更是前仆后继。但这些仁人志士其所以赢得人民的敬爱，却首先因为他们是忧国忧民、公而忘私的人。他们的世界观虽然说不上是集体主义的，但和那种自私自利、唯利是图的个人主义却完全不是一回事。我不否认，资产阶级个人主义在冲毁封建制度的藩篱中起过一定的积极作用；但是资产阶级的这点好名声，同时也是以劳动人民的被榨取、被欺凌作为代价的。个人主义在我国历史上的积极作用，显然是被过分地夸大了。
    在我国条件下，甚至属于资产阶级革命范畴的反帝、反封建的任务——经济上的，政治上的，更不要说是思想上的任务了，资产阶级个人主义都是无能为力的；只有等到工人阶级起来领导的新民主主义革命，才把长期压在人民身上的大山推倒了。而资产阶级和地主阶级携手合作、资产阶级思想和封建思想烧香拜把的例子，我们倒是看得不少的。资产阶级个人主义，甚至在新民主主义革命运动中，已经暴露出它的反动身分了。抗日战争后期，罗隆基、曾昭抡之流打起“民主个人主义”的招牌，从事反苏反共的活动，胡风集团揭起个人主义、个性解放的旗帜，干出反马克思主义和反人民的勾当，这些事我们还没有忘掉。革命进入社会主义阶段，个人主义成为彻头彻尾的毒草；在一个革命者身上潜伏的个人主义毒素，成为可怕的癌细胞，发展起来成为致命的绝症；那就是不难理解的了。
    我暂且不说那些浑身浸透了个人主义毒汁的人。就是这些人，在新社会也可以找到消毒去病的一切方便条件，只看他有没有改造自己的决心。我要说的是许多革命知识分子身上的个人主义毒素。说它是头脑中的私有制，是再恰当不过的。这是从剥削阶级那里带来的一种怪毛病：总是眼睛睁得尖尖的，要名，要利，要权，要很高的享受；总是手伸得长长的，想争，想夺，想偷，想抢不该属于他的东西。头脑中的这些极端卑鄙的要求，在旧社会可能受到鼓励，在新社会是会受到指责的。潜藏很深的个人主义，因此就和旧制度挂了钩，和新制度结了怨。反党、反社会主义的根子，埋在这里。个人主义有一分，这一分就和社会主义、集体主义格格不入。个人主义有十分，就和社会主义、集体主义十分格格不入。个人主义在一个人身上居于主导地位的时候，他就觉得他在集体生活中处处“不自由”，“个性”受压抑，按照阶级斗争的规律，他就要斗“争”，要“反抗”，要“个性解放”，要“杀身成仁”。个人主义得到恶性的发展，正像癌症到了迸发期，他就和社会主义、集体主义猛烈地冲突起来，干下了一切恶事。
    病人身上的癌，如果发现得早，是有办法医治的。怕就怕在不能及早地发现它。而个人主义的癌，不管潜藏得多么深，患者多少是有些自知之明的。要是你肯于大胆地暴露它，别人指出病象的时候敢于正视它，并且依靠集体的帮助决心消除它，那么，逢凶化吉的可能性是完全存在的。我们集体生活的好处也表现在这里：它讲究的是互助互爱，治病救人。病根一除，头脑中的私有制没有了，主观的东西和客观发展的规律趋于一致，这时候才能体会到跳下病床之后的真正的自由和真正的个性解放。千万不要听信了右派分子徐懋庸的欺骗；他主张对思想上的病症保持“乐观的镇静”，所谓“置生死于度外”，让它自由发展到昏迷不醒的“极期”，据说这样“会得一直往右，也可以回头向左”！因此他要我们在右派进攻的面前“也要镇静，不要因为患者发烧太猛而就陷于绝望”（见徐懋庸作“极期”一文）。但徐懋庸的极端个人主义的癌症，就是因为不肯动手术，经过几次“极期”，只见其“一直往右”，未见其“回头向左”，在不久以前的一次极端疯狂的“极期”中，全身癌毒一齐迸发起来，成为不肯回头的右派分子。徐懋庸的“极期”论骗不了别人，却害了他自己。这是应当引以为戒的。
    新年试笔，并以自警。
