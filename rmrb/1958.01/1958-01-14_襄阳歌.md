Title: The Song of Xiangyang

The House of Xi in Xiangyang, a place passed down from the Jin Dynasty,
With wine banquets held amidst flowers and willows.
Even more, there's Mount Xian to ascend,
To linger and lament at the Tablet of Fallen Tears;
Li Bai's "Song of Xiangyang,"
Mount Xian, for a thousand years, has been immortalized in poetic history.
I come now, a thousand years later,
The grass on Mount Tongtong Xian is lush and green;
The wailing wind in the ancient pines is no longer seen,
Only ruined pavilions and broken walls remain for wistful remembrance.
The Han River has changed course, winding around distant shoals,
No flowing water beneath Mount Xian;
Su Shi once savored the shortened-neck bream,
But searching for his haunts, there is no news.
Elegant demeanors and fleeting clouds, a mere transmission of empty fame,
The remaining mountains and waters are not worth seeing.
Suddenly, I hear voices rising from the front of the mountain,
Running east and west, busily carrying earth,
Red flags flashing as they build high embankments,
A long canal winding left and right.
Youths raise hammers to smash the mountain,
Sparks and dust swirling around their waists,
Maidens carry earth with swift steps,
Their long braids like butterflies dancing on their shoulders.
Even more, strong men surround the embankment,
Raising stone pestles high in unison, singing,
As the song ends, the stone pestles fall,
The mountain shakes and the earth trembles for a long time.
Going down the mountain and up the embankment, I inquire in detail,
Cooperative members speak with joy.
They want to draw mountain springs to all directions,
The reservoir embraces the south of Mount Xian,
Cultivating green forests on the mountain,
Bream fish will return to swim in deep pools.
Recreating the scenic spot of Mount Xian,
And irrigating ten thousand acres of fields;
Clear water flows in front of thousands of homes,
Girls wash clothes under the eaves.
Talking about love on the reservoir,
Fish and rice will be abundant throughout the countryside.
Uprooting the bitter cork trees from their roots,
Sowing the seeds of happiness for everyone,
If you ask who initiated this,
It's because the social system is good,
It's because the cooperative strength is strong,
It's because the wisdom of the masses is great,
It's because it's the Party's good proposition.
A conversation that makes my heart feel joyful,
Raising my head to look again at the new scenery,
Not looking at the moss-covered Yang Hu Tablet,
Laughing at the ancients shedding tears in vain!
Not looking at the withered willow of the House of Xi,
Laughing at Shanyang Gong pretending to be drunk in the mud!
The healthy and beautiful girls before my eyes,
Put to shame the women working on the embankments of the past!
The earth-shaking pestle pounding song,
Overwhelms the white copper boots of the past!
If Li Bai were fortunate enough to be born today,
He would grind ink and unfold paper to write new poems!
Heaven is not old, and the earth is not barren,
Rivers and mountains have long awaited new people to rise.

    襄阳歌
    蔡其矫久传晋代习家池，花前柳下摆酒席，更有岘山登临处，沉吟徘徊堕泪碑；李白一篇襄阳歌，岘山千年垂诗史。我来已是千年后，童童岘山草萋萋，鸣风苍松既不见，颓亭残垣空追忆。汉江改道绕远滩，岘山底下无流水，苏轼曾尝缩项鳊，探访游处无消息。风流云散虚名传，剩山余水不足看。忽闻人声起山前，东奔西走挑土忙，红旗闪处垒高堤，一条长渠左右盘。青年举起砸山锤，火花尘烟绕腰间，少女运土步如飞，长辫蝴蝶舞双肩。更有壮汉围堤上，高举石硪齐歌唱，歌句一停石硪落，山摇地动久盘旋。下山上堤细访问，合作社员开怀谈。要引山泉来四方，水库抱揽岘山南，山上栽培绿林帐，鳊鱼重游深水潭。再造岘山风景地，又能灌溉万亩田；千家屋前流碧水，闺女檐下洗衣衫。谈情说爱水库上，渔米丰足遍四乡。黄连苦树连根拔，幸福种子大家撒，要问这事谁发起，那是社会制度好，那是合作力量强，那是群众智慧大，那是党的好主张。一席谈话畅胸臆，抬头重看新景色，不看青苔羊祜碑，笑那古人空堕泪！不看枯柳习家池，笑那山公假泥醉！眼前健美好姑娘，羞杀当时大堤女！震天动地打硪歌，压倒从前白铜鞮！李白有幸生今日，磨墨展纸写新诗！天既不老地不荒，河山久待新人起。
