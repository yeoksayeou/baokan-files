Xinhua News Agency report: Egyptian and Syrian public opinion has commented on Dulles' preparation to attend the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council, believing that this shows that U.S. imperialism is plotting a new aggressive conspiracy in the Middle East.

    Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Minister of Justice Kazbari said on the 30th that regardless of whether Dulles attends the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, the free Arab countries will resolutely pursue a policy of active neutrality. He said that the number of people supporting this policy is increasing.
    Kazbari said that no matter what efforts the imperialist bloc makes, it is impossible to prevent the free people of all countries or the people of countries striving for freedom from moving forward.
    The "Victory News" said that Dulles' attendance at the meeting "proves that imperialism is planning a new conspiracy against the free Arab countries." The "Opinion News" said that Dulles' attendance is related to a new imperialist conspiracy against Syria. The newspaper said that the imperialists will never give up their attempts to overthrow the current national systems of Syria and Egypt.
    Cairo Dispatch: Egypt's "News" reported on the 30th that representatives from the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, representing more than half of the world's population, have unanimously expressed their opposition to the Baghdad Pact, which is a fatal blow to this military treaty. It seems that Dulles' current action is related to this. The newspaper added: "But it is clear that Dulles' previous efforts to pull Middle Eastern countries to the U.S. side have been frustrated, and this time his new actions will not achieve greater success."

    美国要在中东策动新阴谋
    埃叙舆论斥杜勒斯将出席巴格达集团会议
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：埃及和叙利亚两国舆论就杜勒斯准备出席巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议一事发表评论，认为这表明美帝国主义要在中东策动新的侵略阴谋。
    大马士革消息：叙利亚司法部长卡兹贝里30日说，不管杜勒斯是否参加巴格达条约理事会会议，自由的阿拉伯各国将坚决奉行积极中立政策。他说，拥护这一政策的人日益众多。
    卡兹贝里说，无论帝国主义集团作出怎样的努力，都不可能阻止各国自由人民或者正在争取自由的各国人民向前迈进。
    “胜利报”说，杜勒斯将出席会议这件事，“证明帝国主义要策划新的阴谋反对自由阿拉伯国家”。“舆论报”说，杜勒斯的出席同反对叙利亚的新的帝国主义阴谋有关。这家报纸说，帝国主义者任何时候都不会放弃推翻叙利亚和埃及现在的国家制度的企图。
    开罗消息：埃及“消息报”30日说，代表世界半数以上人口的参加亚非团结大会的代表已经一致表示反对巴格达条约，这是对这个军事条约的致命打击。看来杜勒斯这一次的行动同这个有关。这家报纸又说：“但是很明显，以前杜勒斯想把中东国家拉到美国方面去的努力遭到了挫折，而这次他的新的行动也不会获得更大的成就。”
