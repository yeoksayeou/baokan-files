Yunnan Province will send 90,000 cadres to the labor front and grassroots work posts, while also mobilizing 50,000 temporary workers to return to their hometowns for production.

The entire province of Yunnan has only more than 450,000 cadres and workers and more than 170,000 temporary workers, but judging from the situation revealed in this rectification movement, bloated organizations and overstaffing are still very common, and some are quite prominent. The Provincial Highway Engineering Bureau, due to its oversized organization and unclear division of labor, resulted in a "ping-pong" phenomenon: work was pushed back and forth. The administrative welfare section of the Yunnan Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau has as many as 76 employees, of which 28 are management cadres. Because there are too many people and not enough work, one person is used to sell barber tickets, and one person is used to issue letters of introduction... Some agencies have too many levels and complicated procedures, making it difficult to do their work well. For example, the notification issued by the Provincial Department of Agriculture regarding the prevention and control of cotton pests was still traveling in the office when the cotton was harvested. Therefore, the vast majority of cadres urgently requested to streamline the organization.

At the same time, in the struggle against the Rightists and the rectification movement, cadres from intellectual backgrounds universally felt the need to transform themselves through labor. In addition, with a clearer understanding of the significance of going to the countryside and up to the mountains, "Working hard for ten years to build a new countryside" has become the common slogan of the vast majority of cadres.

In order to strengthen the leadership work at the grassroots level, many cadres with rich practical work experience will also be sent down. Currently, the CPC Yunnan Provincial Committee has approved the sending down of nine people, including members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Yunnan Provincial Committee, deputy ministers, and deputy directors of the Provincial People's Committee.

This newspaper reports that Anhui Province has formulated a further reorganization plan to continue to vigorously streamline organizations and send down another 41,000 cadres to participate in production and strengthen grassroots leadership.

The plan stipulates that the number of personnel in provincial-level agencies should be reduced by an average of another 10%, and some departments should be reduced by 20%-40%. Special districts and municipal-level agencies should be streamlined as much as possible depending on the specific circumstances. The number of staff in county-level agencies should be reduced by an average of 10% based on the special district. The administrative management personnel of factories and mines should be reduced by 30% to 50%, and the proportion of management personnel to the total number of employees should be controlled at around 10%, with a maximum not exceeding 15%. The staff of enterprises and institutions in the financial, trade, agricultural, and other systems should be reduced by an average of another 15%, of which the management personnel of enterprises should be reduced by another 30%. The staffing of schools and hospitals should also be streamlined as much as possible.

These transferred cadres will go to rural areas and mountainous areas to participate in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other production in accordance with the policy of facing the countryside and facing production. At present, the Provincial Party Committee has decided to establish a large-scale forestry and animal husbandry farm in the mountainous area of southern Anhui, and will send a responsible comrade to personally lead 3,000 to 4,000 people to participate in the development of the mountainous area, a considerable part of whom are section and department-level cadres from various departments, commissions, and offices of the province.

In the spring of 1957, Anhui Province had already sent down more than 92,000 cadres, of which more than 48,000 participated in labor production. They have been tempered in agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and organized collective production units, and have created a large amount of wealth for society. According to statistics from 303 collective production units, the output value produced by more than 6,000 people is approximately 6.25 million yuan, of which 91 units have been able to be self-sufficient and have a surplus.

### 云南九万干部将到劳动中锻炼  安徽决定再下放干部四万多名

    云南九万干部将到劳动中锻炼  安徽决定再下放干部四万多名
    本报讯　云南省将下放九万干部到劳动战线和基层工作岗位上去，同时并动员五万临时工回乡生产。
    云南全省只有干部职工四十五万多人，临时工十七万多人，但从这次整改中所揭露出的情况来看，机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象仍然是很普遍的，有的还相当突出。省公路工程局，由于机构过大，分工不清，结果形成了“打乒乓”的现象：工作上推来推去。云南有色金属工业管理局的行政福利科职工多达七十六人，其中单是管理干部就有二十八人，由于人多事少，结果卖理发票用一个人，开介绍信用一个人……。还有一些机关，层次过多，手续繁琐，很难做好工作。如省农业厅拟发的有关防治棉花虫害的通知，到棉花收完了，文件还是在办公室里旅行。因此，广大干部都迫切要求紧缩机构。
    与此同时，在反右派斗争和整风运动中，知识分子出身的干部都普遍的感到有到劳动中改造自己的必要，再加上对下乡上山的意义有了较明确的认识，“苦干十年，建设新农村”已成了广大干部的共同口号。
    为了加强基层的领导工作，不少具有丰富的实际工作经验的干部也将下放，目前已经中共云南省委批准下放的有中共云南省委常委、副部长及省人委副厅长等共九人。
    本报讯　安徽省已制定了进一步整编的方案，继续大力紧缩机构，再下放四万一千名干部参加生产和加强基层领导。
    方案中规定省级机关的人员平均再减10％，有的部门要减少20％—40％。专区和市级机关应根据具体情况尽量紧缩。县级机关的工作人员以专区为单位平均减少10％。厂矿行政管理人员要减少30％到50％，管理人员占职工总数的比例应控制在10％左右，最高不能超过15％。财、贸、农等系统的企业和事业单位的工作人员，平均再减少15％，其中企业管理人员再减少30％。学校、医院的编制也要尽量紧缩。
    这些被抽调的干部，将根据面向农村、面向生产的方针到农村、山区去参加农业、林业、畜牧业和其他生产。目前省委已决定在皖南山区建立一座大型林牧农场，并将派一位负责同志亲自率领三千到四千人去参加开发山区，其中有相当一部分是省各部、委、厅的科、处长级干部。
    安徽省1957年春天已经下放干部九万二千多人，其中四万八千多人都参加了劳动生产。他们在农业社、手工业合作社和组织的集体生产单位中得到了锻炼，并已为社会创造了一笔很大的财富。据三百零三个集体生产单位统计，六千多人生产的产值约计六百二十五万多元，其中已有九十一个单位都能自给并有盈余。
