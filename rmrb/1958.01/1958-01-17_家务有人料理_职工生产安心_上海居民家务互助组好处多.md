Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 15th: Nine neighborhood committees in Shanghai have organized household mutual aid groups to help working families with few available hands manage their household chores, while also enabling some housewives to increase their income and supplement their household budget.

In these neighborhoods, some professional women do not have enough time to manage household chores, some couples both go out to work and have no one to take care of their children at home, and are often physically away but with their minds at home; there are also some families with many children, elderly people, and women who have just given birth who also need help. Therefore, many people, even if they are not financially well-off, have to hire nannies, increasing the burden on their families. Due to the large-scale employment of nannies in the city, a large number of rural women have been attracted to Shanghai. Among the ninety-two nannies in the Fuson Lane and Mingyuan Lane neighborhoods, sixty-four are new arrivals from rural areas.

Based on the needs of the masses, the neighborhood residents' committees and women's representatives have organized some housewives in the neighborhoods who have surplus labor and are willing to help their neighbors to do housework for their neighbors, charging a small fee. The content of household mutual aid is diverse, helping with whatever is needed, on call and very convenient. From cooking and washing clothes to taking care of children, everything can be mutually assisted. Various labor compensations have certain regulations.

With household chores taken care of, workers can also concentrate on production. The female worker Wang Aizhen and her husband both work and have to take care of five children when they return home, leaving no time for other household chores. Now she entrusts the household chores to her neighbors, and both she and her husband can concentrate on production. Some single workers living in the neighborhood originally planned to bring their wives from the countryside to Shanghai to handle household chores, but now, with the help of the household mutual aid group, they have also abandoned this idea. With the household mutual aid group, some housewives have also increased their income and improved their lives. The eleven members of the Rongchang Lane Mutual Aid Group earned more than 250 yuan in November last year. After joining the mutual aid group, many families in difficulty have increased their income and have taken the initiative to request that the government stop providing relief or reduce the amount of relief money.

The Shanghai Women's Federation and labor departments believe that these organizational forms, in which the masses use their own strength to carry out mutual aid and solve their own livelihood and welfare problems, are good ways to cooperate with the work of mobilizing agricultural populations to return to their hometowns and to implement the policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift among residents. Several districts in Shanghai are now introducing and promoting this practice.

### 家务有人料理　职工生产安心  上海居民家务互助组好处多

    家务有人料理　职工生产安心
    上海居民家务互助组好处多
    新华社上海15日电　上海有九条里弄居民组织家务互助组，帮助人手少的职工家庭料理家务，同时使一部分家庭劳动妇女增加收入，补贴家用。
    在这些里弄中，有些职业妇女没有足够的时间料理家务，有的夫妻俩都外出工作，家中孩子无人照应，常常人在外边，心在家里；还有些多子女的家庭妇女、老人和产妇也需要人帮助。因此许多人在经济并不宽裕的情况下，也不得不雇了保姆，增加了家庭负担。由于城市大量雇用保姆，吸引了大批农村劳动妇女流入上海。福森里和明园里两条里弄的九十二名保姆中，就有六十四人是新近由农村流入城市的。
    根据群众的需要，里弄居民委员会和妇代会将里弄里一些有多余劳动力的、而且愿意帮助邻居的家庭妇女组织起来，为邻居做家务，略为取一些报酬。家务互助的内容是多种多样的，需要帮助什么就帮做什么，随叫随到，非常方便。从烧饭、洗衣服到带孩子，样样都可以互助。各种劳动报酬都有一定规定。
    家务有人料理，职工生产也安心了。女工王爱珍夫妻俩工作，回来要照顾五个孩子，其他家务来不及做。现在她把家务委托给邻居料理，夫妻俩人都可以安心生产了。有些住在里弄的单身职工本来准备把乡下的妻子接到上海来处理家务的，现在得到家务互助组的帮助，也打消了这主意。有了家务互助组，一部分家庭劳动妇女也增加了收入，改善了生活。荣昌里互助组十一人在去年11月份共收入二百五十多元。好多困难户参加互助组后收入增加，主动提出不要政府救济或减少救济金。
    这些群众运用自己的力量进行互助，解决自己生活福利问题的组织形式，上海市妇联和劳动部门认为是配合动员农业人口回乡工作和在居民中贯彻勤俭建国与勤俭持家方针的好办法。现在上海已有好几个区正在介绍推广这一作法。
