    Guangzhou Zoo Opens

    The newly built Guangzhou Zoo opened on New Year's Day. The zoo covers an area of ​​30 hectares, and the construction of the first phase of 15 hectares of land has been completed. Apart from the Beijing Zoo, this zoo is already one of the larger zoos in China.

    The Guangzhou Zoo has domesticated animals that grow in South China's tropical and subtropical regions, such as the clouded leopard, golden cat, and South China tiger among carnivores, the water buffalo deer and Sumatran serow among herbivores, as well as various apes such as macaques and white-cheeked gibbons, and Hainan parrots, thrushes, and white swallows among birds. In addition, there are the most characteristic amphibians and reptiles of Guangdong, such as various snakes, giant salamanders, and newts, which have not yet moved into their new homes because the houses have not been built yet. The zoo will build a special amphibian and reptile hall in the first quarter of this year. In terms of fish, in addition to goldfish, it is also prepared to greatly develop tropical fish.

    广州动物园开放
    新建的广州动物园已在元旦开放。动物园共占地三十公顷，第一期十五公顷土地的建筑工程已经完成，除了北京动物园以外，这个动物园已经是我国目前较大的动物园了。
    广州动物园里，驯养了华南热带、亚热带生长的动物，如食肉类中的云豹、金猫、华南虎，食草类中的水牛鹿、苏门羚，还有各种猿猴如猕猴、白胡长臂猿，和鸟类中的海南鹦鹉、画眉、白燕等。另外还有最具有广东特点的两栖爬行类，如各种蛇、鲵鱼、蝾螈等，因为房子未建好，还没有迁进新居。动物园在今年第一季度将特别建设一个两栖爬行馆。鱼类方面除了金鱼以外，还准备大量发展热带鱼。　（新华社）
