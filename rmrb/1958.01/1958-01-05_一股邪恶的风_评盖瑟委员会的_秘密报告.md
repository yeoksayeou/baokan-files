An Evil Wind
——Commenting on the Gaither Committee's "Secret Report"
Gao Ji

    Recently, the Gaither Committee's "secret report," formulated by some American monopoly capitalists and their various agents, has stirred up an evil wind of intensified and frenzied arms expansion in the United States. The Gaither Committee and their supporters are using all their power and influence to put their plans into practice; at the same time, they are clamoring through the newspapers and other propaganda machines they control, creating a kind of mad war hysteria to poison the minds of the American public. Therefore, this "report" cannot but attract the attention of public opinion in various countries.
    The "Gaither Report" began to be written in the summer of 1957, and it was formally submitted to the United States National Security Council after the Soviet Union's second artificial earth satellite went into space. During this period, more and more facts proved that the socialist camp had greatly surpassed the imperialist camp in terms of the balance of power. The Gaither Committee was very sensitive to this point. According to a report in the American "New York Herald Tribune," the Gaither Committee investigated all aspects of the strength of the Soviet Union and the United States. The result of the investigation was that "the Russians are currently stronger than the United States," and the committee members all acknowledged that "the Soviet Union's leading position is irresistible." The "Washington Post" reported that the "Gaither Report" revealed the "extremely unpleasant reality" of the balance of power between the Soviet Union and the United States for the United States, and that the United States "is on the road to becoming a second-rate country."
    The Soviet Union's surpassing the United States in the development of important science and technology and military technology is a result of the competition between the two social systems. On the one hand, the Gaither Committee could not but admit the advantages possessed by the Soviet Union, but on the other hand, it fabricated the Soviet Union's advantages as a "threat" to the United States out of nothing, and attempted to use this situation to stir up a frenzy of arms expansion and war preparation in the United States. For this reason, the "Gaither Report" shouted loudly that "the United States is in serious danger," that the United States has been "exposed to the almost direct threat of the Soviet Union's missile array," and that if the United States does not step up arms expansion and war preparation, it will face "catastrophe," and so on.
    If this hysterical shouting of the "Gaither Report" had the slightest bit of truth, the United States should have been destroyed by now. Because, if the Soviet Union really had aggressive intentions towards the United States, the best way would be to realize this intention now, and not sit idly by while the United States boasted about implementing the arms expansion plan recommended by the "Gaither Report." However, the fact is that although the Soviet Union has the military advantage of possessing the latest weapons, it is doing its utmost to advocate the prohibition of the use of such weapons in order to end the "cold war" and the arms race, and to carry out peaceful competition between the two social systems. Where is the "threat" to the United States from the Soviet Union that the "Gaither Report" clamors about?
    On the contrary, it is the "Gaither Report" that is a great threat to the peace and security of the people of all countries, including the American people. According to American newspapers, the "Gaither Report" advocates that the United States' arms expansion and war preparation activities should continue from now until the end of 1970, and that the "main military emphasis should be placed on offensive forces." This so-called "offensive force" is to increase the "initial operational capability" of medium-range missiles to four times its current level; and to increase the capacity of planned intercontinental missiles to almost ten times. As for the purpose of strengthening this "offensive force," according to a report by "Washington Post" reporter Drew Pearson, it is to launch a "preventive war," that is, a so-called "preemptive" war.
    In addition, the "Gaither Report" also advocates that the United States, after establishing the above-mentioned so-called "offensive capability," should also "greatly strengthen the preparation for limited warfare." The report also pointed out that the so-called "limited war" is "a more likely war to occur," especially in the Middle East and Asia.
    The "preemptive" war and "limited war" clamored by the "Gaither Report" are not surprising novelties. Former U.S. Secretary of the Navy Matthews had already issued a shout about launching a "preemptive" war as early as August 1950. However, this proposition, supported by the extremely bellicose forces in the United States, even under the balance of power at that time (when the United States considered itself to have an atomic advantage over the Soviet Union), some people in the American ruling group were worried about its serious consequences. At that time, officials of the U.S. State Department said that Matthews' concept was wrong because "in a war between modern great powers, neither side can avoid major sacrifices and permanent losses to win the war." The current balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union is such that even the "Gaither Report" admits that it is completely at a disadvantage. In this case, acting according to Matthews' old tune will not only cause the United States to "inevitably suffer major sacrifices and permanent losses," but will also cause the American imperialism to suffer a devastating blow. Therefore, the Gaither Committee's clamor about "preemptive" war can only be seen as a desperate attempt after the bankruptcy of the American "policy of strength."
    As for the so-called "limited war," this is a fantasy of a part of the American ruling group. Under the current conditions of military technology, a war involving major powers will not be a "limited war." If the so-called "limited war" has any real meaning, it is that the "Gaither Report" and other figures in the American ruling group attempt to use "limited war" to carry out armed plunder against colonies and newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. In the autumn of 1957, the United States' plot to instigate Turkey and other countries to launch a war of aggression against Syria was a plan to launch a so-called "limited war." However, due to the Syrian government and people's firm opposition to imperialist aggression, and due to the solemn warning issued by the Soviet Union, the American aggressive forces finally had to withdraw their hands. It can be seen that "limited war" is not a satisfactory calculation for the United States either.
    The Gaither Report's mad propositions reflect the panic of certain powerful groups in the American ruling group in the face of the world situation in which the east wind prevails over the west wind. They are clearly trying to use arms expansion and war preparation to save the United States' "strength" status that has already been lost, so as to continue to pursue its policy of aggression. But the fact that the American "policy of strength" has suffered more and more serious failures has long proved that this is a dead end that cannot be followed. The American "New York Post" once denounced the Gaither Committee's report in an editorial as a "new madness" that would even "pale in comparison with the stupidity of going back to the cave age," and believed that the American government's consideration of such mad suggestions after the bankruptcy of its "policy of strength" was "unimaginable." Even a bourgeois newspaper like the "New York Post" believes that this is only a desperate struggle, not a way out.
    In order to realize its mad plan, the "Gaither Report" "urgently demanded a great increase in military spending." According to a report in the "Washington Post," this demand is divided into two aspects: one is to cope with the so-called "top priority task," that is, the expenditure for developing missiles, etc., which will increase by 8 billion US dollars per year compared with the current expenditure when it reaches the "peak" of this expenditure in 1960 and 1961; the other is to cope with the so-called "second priority task," that is, the expenditure for building so-called "civilian shelters," which will be 5 billion US dollars per year. In addition, there are other expenses that must be increased. It is estimated that to do everything that the "Gaither Report" suggests, an average of 20 billion or more US dollars will have to be spent each year during the period ending in 1970.
    According to the budget, the US government's revenue and expenditure are close to balance, but it is reported that the actual expenditure in 1957-58 will be overspent. In this case, it is already difficult for the US government to maintain the balance of the budget. How can it scrape together this annual increase of 20 billion US dollars for arms expansion and war preparation? The Gaither Committee's methods are: 1. Increase tax rates; 2. Increase the maximum limit of national debt to 300 billion US dollars (currently 275 billion US dollars); 3. Abandon certain domestic welfare programs.
    The US government's expenditure, including the expenditure of state and local governments, is estimated to reach 123.1 billion US dollars in 1957, accounting for 29.2% of the gross national product. On the other hand, the United States' public and private debt had reached 693 billion US dollars by the end of 1956, which is approximately equal to 203% of one year's national income, which is only slightly better than the situation in the economic crisis years of 1929, when public and private debt was equal to 217% of national income. Such a heavy burden on the national economy is considered by many important figures in the American ruling group to be an important source of inflation. Humphrey, the former US Secretary of the Treasury who recently left office, advocated in January last year to "quickly stop" the "trend of increasing the federal budget"; he believed that unless the budget was cut, the United States would "encounter a terrible depression." Humphrey's proposition was supported by some people in the American bourgeoisie.
    Now, the United States is facing an increasingly obvious economic recession, but the Gaither Committee is trying to use the method of increasing government spending to resist this recession. According to the Gaither Committee, as long as the Washington government tries its best to take money out of the pockets of the people, it can guarantee the "prosperity" of the military industry, thereby guaranteeing the war profits they desire. They have clearly forgotten that what Humphrey was worried about was precisely the approach they were planning, because it would not only fail to stop the economic recession that was already arriving, but would instead strengthen the trend of inflation, prompting "a terrible depression" to arrive more quickly.
    The "Gaither Report" has caused different reactions in the United States. Although some forces that are extremely keen on aggressive expansion and stepped-up war preparations are doing their best to advocate and support this report, the Washington authorities cannot but worry that this report will cause opposition from the broad masses of the American people. A report in the "Washington Post" said: Although Eisenhower had stated that he personally was willing to follow the report's recommendations, he was very uneasy about the fact that the American people would refuse to pay the bill. A commentary in the "New York Times" also pointed out: This report from the Gaither Committee would "create electoral dangers" for the government. Under the pressure of the real situation and the broad masses of the people, more and more people in the American ruling group are advocating adopting realistic policies and holding East-West talks to seek peaceful coexistence with socialist countries. It is by no means accidental that a bourgeois newspaper like the "New York Post" publicly denounced the "Gaither Report." It can be seen from this that the forces of resistance encountered by the Gaither Committee's mad attempts in the United States will not be small.
    However, it is worth noting that the Gaither Committee represents the forces of the powerful and most aggressive oil and arms companies in the American monopoly group. Foster, one of the leaders of the Gaither Committee, and McCloy, a member of its advisory group, are both important figures in the Rockefeller Consortium. Foster is the vice chairman of "Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation," which belongs to the Rockefeller Consortium, while McCloy is the chairman of the Chase Bank of the Rockefeller Consortium. The Rockefeller Consortium not only controls a large part of the oil production in the United States and the capitalist world, but also occupies an important position in the American arms industry. Howard, the head of missile production at the U.S. Department of Defense, is a manager of New York Mobil Oil Company of the Rockefeller Consortium. The representatives of the Morgan Consortium on the committee and advisory group are Primm, Keller, and Fickes of Bell Telephone Laboratories, while the Bell System's American Telephone and Telegraph Company ranks sixth among the thirteen largest US arms suppliers. Other members of the advisory group include important figures from Westinghouse Corporation, which belongs to the Mellon family, retired Admiral Carr, and partner Rowett from Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Westinghouse Corporation is one of the largest US arms companies; Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. not only controls most of the US railways, but also has considerable influence in aircraft and missile production. As for the enterprises in which retired Generals Hull and Doolittle, members of the advisory group, are involved, they are all closely related to oil and arms production.
    The most ardent supporter of the "Gaither Report" is U.S. Vice President Nixon. Behind this vice president stands the Southern California Consortium, which also made its fortune by manufacturing military aircraft and extracting oil. Douglas Aircraft Company, which is currently manufacturing and designing various types of missiles for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, is an enterprise controlled by Giannini, a big financier in Southern California.
    In short, the members of the Gaither Committee and their supporters are all figures who are eager to make a fortune from arms expansion, war preparation, and aggressive expansion. No wonder the "Chicago Daily Tribune" pointed out not long ago: "When this group of people (the members of the Gaither Committee) gather, the war drums will sound." The "Gaither Report" shows a mad trend of this part of the American monopoly forces, which must be guarded against by the people of all countries and all peace-loving forces.

    一股邪恶的风
    ——评盖瑟委员会的“秘密报告”
    高集
    最近，由一些美国的垄断资本家和他们的各式各样的代理人所制订的盖瑟委员会的“秘密报告”，在美国煽起了一股加紧疯狂备战的邪恶的风。盖瑟委员会和他们的支持者一面在运用他们的全部势力和影响，使他们的计划见诸实行；同时还通过他们所控制的报纸和其他宣传机器大肆叫嚷，制造一种疯狂的战争歇斯底里，以毒化美国公众的心灵。因此，这个“报告”就不能不引起各国舆论的注意了。
    “盖瑟报告”是1957年的夏天开始编写的，而正式向美国国家安全委员会提出则是在苏联第二个人造地球卫星上了天之后。在这个期间有越来越多的事实证明，社会主义阵营在力量对比方面已大大地超过了帝国主义阵营。对于这一点，盖瑟委员会是十分敏感的。据美国“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，盖瑟委员会调查了苏联和美国的力量的各方面的情况，调查的结果认为：“俄国人目前比美国强大”，并且，这个委员会的委员们都承认“苏联的领先地位是势不可当的”。“华盛顿邮报”在报道中说，“盖瑟报告”显示了苏联和美国力量对比对于美国的“极其不愉快的现实情况”，美国“正走在通向第二等国家地位的道路上”。
    苏联在重要的科学技术和军事技术的发展方面超过了美国，这是两种社会制度竞赛的一个结果。盖瑟委员会一方面不能不承认苏联所拥有的优势，但另一方面却又无中生有地把苏联的优势说成是对美国的“威胁”，并企图利用这种情况在美国煽起扩军备战的狂潮。为此，“盖瑟报告”大嚷大叫地说什么“美国处于严重危险中”啦，美国已经“暴露在导弹林立的苏联的几乎是直接的威胁下”啦，以至于如果美国不加紧扩军备战就要面临“奇灾大祸”啦，等等。
    “盖瑟报告”这种歇斯底里的叫嚷如果有丝毫真实性的话，美国现在就应该被毁灭了。因为，苏联如果真对美国有侵略意图的话，最好的办法是现在就实现它的这种意图，而不会坐待美国大吹大擂地去实现“盖瑟报告”所建议的扩军计划。然而，事实是苏联虽然掌握了最新式武器的军事优势，它却竭力主张禁止使用这种武器，以结束“冷战”和军备竞赛，并在两个社会制度之间展开和平竞赛。那里有什么“盖瑟报告”所叫嚷的苏联对美国的“威胁”呢？
    相反的，正是“盖瑟报告”才是对包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民的和平与安全的绝大威胁。据美国报纸透露，“盖瑟报告”主张把美国扩军备战行动从现在起一直进行到1970年底，而且要把“主要军事侧重点放在进攻力量上”。这种所谓的“进攻力量”就是把中程导弹的“初步作战能力”提高到目前的四倍；把计划中的洲际导弹的能力增加到差不多十倍。至于加强这种“进攻力量”的目的，据“华盛顿邮报”记者德鲁·皮尔逊的报道说，是为了发动一场“预防性战争”，也就是所谓“先发制人”的战争。
    此外，“盖瑟报告”还主张，美国在建立了上述的所谓“进攻能力”的情况下，还要“大大加强进行有限战争的准备工作”。报告并指出，所谓“有限战争”是“一种比较可能发生的战争”，特别是在中东和亚洲。
    “盖瑟报告”所叫嚷的“先发制人”战争和“有限战争”，并不是什么惊人的新鲜货色。美国前海军部长马休斯早在1950年8月就曾发出过关于发动一场“先发制人”战争的叫嚷。但是，这种受到美国的极端好战的势力支持的主张，甚至就在当时力量对比的情况下（那时美国自认为对苏联是拥有原子优势的），美国统治集团中也有人担心它的严重后果。当时美国国务院的官员就说，马休斯的观念是错误的，因为“近代大国间的战争中任何一方均不能避免重大的牺牲与永久的损失而获得战争”。现在美国与苏联的力量的对比，连“盖瑟报告”也承认完全居于劣势。在这种情况下，要按马休斯的那种老调来办事，其所引起的后果就绝不止是美国“不能避免重大的牺牲与永久的损失”，而是使美国帝国主义遭到毁灭性的打击。所以，盖瑟委员会的关于“先发制人”的战争的叫嚣，只能被看作是美国“实力政策”破产后的一种绝望的企图。
    至于所谓“有限战争”，这是美国统治集团一部分人的幻想。在目前的军事技术条件下，大国卷入的战争就不会是什么“有限战争”。如果说所谓“有限战争”有什么真实的含义的话，那就是“盖瑟报告”和美国统治集团的其他人物企图利用“有限战争”来对殖民地和亚非新独立的国家进行武装掠夺。1957年秋天，美国策动土耳其和其他国家发动对叙利亚的侵略战争的图谋，就是发动所谓“有限战争”的策划。但是，由于叙利亚政府和人民的坚决反对帝国主义侵略，由于苏联发出的严正警告，美国侵略势力终于不能不缩回手去。可见，“有限战争”对于美国来说也并不是什么如意算盘。
    “盖瑟报告”疯狂的主张，反映了美国统治集团中的某些有势力集团面对着东风压倒西风的世界形势，感到惊慌失措了。他们显然是想用扩军备战的办法来挽救已经丧失掉的美国的“实力”地位，以便继续推行其侵略政策。但是美国的“实力政策”所遭到的越来越严重的失败的事实，早已证明这是一条走不通的死胡同。美国“纽约邮报”曾在一篇社论中指斥盖瑟委员会的报告是甚至使“那种要回到穴居时代去的蠢事”都要“黯然失色”的“新的疯狂”，并认为美国政府在它的“实力政策”破产之后去考虑这种疯狂的建议，是“不可想像的”。连“纽约邮报”这样的资产阶级报纸也认为这只是一种绝望的挣扎，而不是什么出路。
    为了实现它的疯狂计划，“盖瑟报告”“急切地要求大大地增加军事费用”。据“华盛顿邮报”报道，这种要求分两方面：一种是应付所谓“头等优先任务”，即发展导弹等等的开支的，在达到这种开支的“高峰”的1960和1961年，每年要比目前的开支增加八十亿美元；另一种是应付所谓“二等优先任务”，即建筑所谓“民用防避室”的开支的，每年要五十亿美元。此外还有其他的必须增加的开支。据有人估计要做到“盖瑟报告”所建议的一切事情，到1970年底止的这段时期内平均每年得多花费二百亿或者更多的美元。
    按照预算，美国政府的收支是接近于平衡的，但是据报道，1957—58年的实际支出将要超支。在这种情况下，美国政府维持预算的平衡已很困难，它怎样去搜刮这笔每年要增加的二百亿美元的扩军备战的费用呢？盖瑟委员会的办法是：一、提高税率；二、提高国债最高限额到三千亿美元（目前是二千七百五十亿美元）；三、放弃某些国内福利计划。
    美国政府的开支，包括州和地方政府的支出在内，在1957年据估计将达一千二百三十一亿美元，占国民生产总值的29.2％。另一方面，美国的公私债务，在1956年底就已达到六千九百三十亿美元，大约等于一年国民收入的203％，这仅比1929年经济危机年代的情况稍好一些，那时公私债务等于国民收入的217％。国民经济的这样沉重的负担，连美国统治集团中的许多重要人物都认为是促使通货膨胀的重要根源。去职不久的美国前财政部长汉弗来在去年1月就主张“赶快制止”“增加联邦预算的趋势”；他认为除非削减预算，美国就会“碰到一次可怕的萧条”。汉弗来的主张得到美国资产阶级中部分人士的支持。
    现在，美国正面临着越来越为明显的经济上的衰退，然而盖瑟委员会却企图用增加政府开支的办法来抵住这种衰退。照盖瑟委员会看来，只要华盛顿政府尽量从老百姓的荷包里掏出钱来，就可以保证军火工业的“繁荣”，从而也就保证了他们所渴望的战争利润。他们显然是忘记了汉弗来所担忧的正是他们所策划的这种做法，因为它不但不能制止住已经在到来的经济上的衰退，相反的却会加强通货膨胀的趋势，促使“一次可怕的萧条”更加迅速地到来。
    “盖瑟报告”在美国引起了不同的反响。尽管一些极端热衷于侵略扩张和加紧备战的势力，在全力鼓吹和支持这个报告，但是华盛顿当局却不能不担心这个报告将引起广大的美国人民的反对。“华盛顿邮报”的报道说：艾森豪威尔虽曾表示他个人是愿意照着报告的建议办，可是他又十分不安地担心美国人民会拒绝付这笔钱。“纽约时报”在一篇评论中也曾指出：盖瑟委员会的这个报告会给政府“造成选举上的危险”。在现实局势和广大人民群众的压力下，美国统治集团中主张采取现实政策，并举行东西方会谈以寻求与社会主义国家和平共处的人是越来越多了。像“纽约邮报”这样的资产阶级报纸对“盖瑟报告”公开地加以斥责，这绝不是偶然的。由此可见，盖瑟委员会的疯狂企图在美国所遇到的抗拒力量是不会小的。
    但是，值得注意的是，盖瑟委员会代表着美国垄断集团中实力强大的、最具侵略性的石油和军火企业的势力。盖瑟委员会的领导人之一福斯特和它的顾问小组中的成员麦克洛埃，都是洛克菲勒财团的重要人物。福斯特是属于洛克菲勒财团的“奥林·梅提森化学公司”的副董事长，而麦克洛埃则是洛克菲勒财团的大通银行的董事长。洛克菲勒财团不仅控制着美国和资本主义世界的很大一部分的石油生产，并且在美国的军火企业中也占据着不可忽视的地位。美国国防部主管导弹生产的负责人霍拉德，就是洛克菲勒财团的纽约美孚油公司的一个经理。委员会和顾问小组中的摩根财团的代表是贝尔电话实验所的普里姆、凯莱和费克斯，而贝尔系统的美国电话电报公司在十三家美国最大的军备供应者中名列第六。顾问小组的其他成员还有属于梅隆家族的威斯汀豪斯公司的重要人物、退休海军上将卡?，以及布朗兄弟哈里曼公司的合伙人罗维特。威斯汀豪斯公司是美国的最大军火企业之一；布朗兄弟哈里曼公司则不仅控制着美国的大部分铁路，而且在飞机和导弹生产方面也有着可观的势力。至于顾问小组成员中的退休将军赫尔和杜利特所投身的企业，也都是与石油和军火生产有密切的关系的。
    “盖瑟报告”的最狂热的支持者是美国副总统尼克松。在这位副总统后面站着的是美国南加利福尼亚州财团，这个财团也是依靠制造军用飞机和开采石油发财的。现在正在为美国陆、海、空军制造和设计各种类型的导弹的道格拉斯飞机公司，就是南加利福尼亚州的大财阀基安尼尼所控制的企业。
    总之，盖瑟委员会的成员们和他们的支持者都是渴望着从扩军备战和侵略扩张中发财的人物。怪不得“芝加哥每日论坛报”在不久前指出：“这批人（即盖瑟委员会的成员）集合的时候，战鼓就要响起来了”。“盖瑟报告”表明了这一部分美国垄断势力的一种疯狂动向，这是各国人民和所有爱好和平力量必须警惕的。
