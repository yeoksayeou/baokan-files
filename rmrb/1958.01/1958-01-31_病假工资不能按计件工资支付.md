    Sick Pay Should Not Be Paid According to Piece-Rate Wages
    The piece-rate wage system is very effective in stimulating workers to improve labor productivity. However, this system also has many problems. For example, the calculation method of sick pay for workers engaged in piecework is a problem that has not been well resolved.
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Labor Insurance Department recently issued an instruction: for piece-rate workers whose sick leave does not exceed seven working days, pay should be based on the average hourly wage of the previous month's piece-rate wage; for those exceeding seven days, pay should be based on the average hourly wage of the previous three months' piece-rate wage.
    I think this instruction is still inappropriate. It is only natural for piece-rate workers to receive excess wages for exceeding production quotas; but when they are sick and not producing, why should they receive excess wages like they did in the previous month or the previous three months? This unreasonable "consideration" not only fails to comply with the principle of "payment according to work," but also has a negative impact on hourly-paid workers; in other words, the state spends more money, but the effect is not good.

    病假工资不能按计件工资支付
    计件工资制度对刺激工人提高劳动生产率的作用很大。不过，这一制度的问题也不少。比如，干计件活的工人的病假工资计算法，就是一个一直没很好解决的问题。
    全总劳动保险部不久前发了一个指示：计件工人病假不超过七个工作日的，按上月计件工资平均小时工资支付；超过七日的，按前三个月的计件工资平均小时工资支付。
    我觉得，这个指示还是不妥当。计件工人生产超额了得超额工资是理所当然的；但是病了，没有生产了，为什么还要像上个月或者前三个月那样领取超额工资呢？这种不合理的“照顾”，既没有遵守“按劳付酬”原则，对计时工人的影响也不好；也就是说，国家多花了钱，但效果并不好。　（心石）
