    The Back Waves Push the Front Waves
    Things are in motion, and there are always those who are advanced and those who are backward. It's useless to be troubled by "uneven development" all the time.
    The backward are not necessarily always backward, and the advanced are not necessarily always advanced. It would be wrong to look at the advanced and the backward from a fixed and unchanging point of view.
    What is leadership? The most important thing is to discover the advanced, encourage the advanced, take the advanced as examples, and help the general and the backward catch up with the advanced level. At this time, either the original advanced become even more advanced, or the latecomers run to the forefront at a greater speed. This creates new role models and higher goals to strive for. The back waves push the front waves, one wave after another, constantly rising and constantly moving forward.
    In backward units, there are always relatively advanced parts. The methods to help backward units catch up with advanced units are, firstly, to promote the experience of advanced units in backward units, and secondly, to promote the positive factors existing in the backward units themselves. The positive factors within themselves play a decisive role.
    The winter production in Junan County, Shandong Province, has been able to have climax after climax, with increasing momentum and greater achievements, because the county party committee's leadership methods have adapted to the laws of the movement of things.

    后浪推前浪
    事物在运动着，总是有先进的，有落后的。如果老是为“发展不平衡”而苦恼，那是没用处的。
    落后的不一定老落后，先进的也不一定总先进。如果用固定不变的观点看待先进和落后，那就不对了。
    什么是领导？最重要的就是发现先进，鼓励先进，以先进的为榜样，帮助一般的和落后的赶上先进的水平。这时，不是原有的先进者更先进了，就是后来者以更大的速度跑到了最前列。这就出现了新的榜样，有了更高的奋斗目标。后浪推前浪，一浪又一浪，不断高涨，不断前进。
    在落后的单位中，总有比较先进的部分。帮助落后的单位赶上先进的单位的方法，其一是在落后单位推广先进单位的经验，其二是发扬落后单位本身存在的积极因素。本身的积极因素是起决定作用的。
    山东莒南县冬季生产能够高潮接着高潮，劲头越来越高，成绩越来越大，就因为县委的领导方法适应了事物运动的规律。
