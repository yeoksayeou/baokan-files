Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: According to plans formulated by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and various provinces, thirty-five above-quota power generation projects across the country will be fully or partially put into production this year. There will also be twenty-four above-quota hydropower stations under construction this year.

The total installed capacity of power generation projects put into production this year will reach over 900,000 kilowatts, with an annual power generation of more than 4.5 billion kilowatt-hours. This figure is equivalent to half of the total installed capacity of power generation equipment in 1952 before the start of planned construction in China, and will account for 40% of the total installed capacity of new power generation equipment added during the First Five-Year Plan.

The number of power generation, transmission, and substation projects started this year across the country is also more than in any previous year. Adding the projects started in the past few years, a total of one hundred and nineteen above-quota projects will be under construction simultaneously this year. The total production capacity after the completion of these projects will be more than the current total power generation equipment capacity in China.

China's electric power industry experienced great development during the First Five-Year Plan period. The newly added installed capacity of power generation equipment in five years was more than the original total installed capacity of power generation equipment in 1952. High-voltage transmission lines of 110,000 volts and above have also increased more than threefold. However, because the growth of electricity use for industrial and residential purposes has been even faster, many areas still experienced power shortages during the First Five-Year Plan period. This year, due to the arrival of a nationwide upsurge in production and construction, the phenomenon of power shortages will continue to exist. Therefore, this year's capital construction of the electric power industry must, on the one hand, meet the needs of power-deficient areas as much as possible, and on the other hand, actively prepare for new industrial areas. For example, in the Northeast region, eighteen above-quota thermal power plants will be under construction simultaneously this year. In addition to accelerating the construction of the Liaoning and Jilin large power plants currently under construction, the Fularji, Fuxin, Fushun, Dalian, Jinxi, and Benxi power plants will also undergo new expansions, and strive to generate electricity this year or next year. New power plants will also be built in Harbin, Fushun, Dalian, and other places. In the North China region, the newly built Beijing Thermal Power Plant, Baotou Second Thermal Power Plant, Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, and the expansion project of the Shijingshan Power Plant will all begin production this year. The Baotou First Thermal Power Plant and Baoding Thermal Power Plant will also begin construction this year. In addition, in many new industrial areas this year, such as Baoji, Xi'an, and Urumqi in the Northwest, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and Chongqing in the Southwest, and Luoyang and Zhuzhou in the Central South, many new and expanded power plants will be put into production and start construction this year.

In order to actively utilize China's abundant hydropower resources, the investment in hydropower construction this year has also increased by nearly one time compared to last year. Among the above-quota hydropower stations included in this year's national construction plan, in addition to the Sanmenxia, Xin'anjiang, and Yili River hydropower stations that have already started construction, the Huanren in Hunjiang, Liaoning Province, the Zipingpu in Minjiang, Sichuan Province, and the Zhexi in Zishui, Hunan Province, and other places will all begin construction of new hydropower stations this year. These new hydropower stations are relatively large in scale, with installed capacities of 250,000 kilowatts or more.

### 三十五个大工程投入生产  二十四个水电站  今年施工今年发电能力将增加九十多万瓩

    三十五个大工程投入生产
    二十四个水电站
    今年施工今年发电能力将增加九十多万瓩
    新华社30日讯　根据电力工业部和各省制定的计划，今年全国将有三十五个限额以上的发电工程全部或部分投入生产，将在今年建设的限额以上的水电站也有二十四个。
    今年投入生产的发电工程的设备容量总计达九十多万瓩，每年可以发电四十五亿多度。这个数字相当于我国开始有计划建设前1952年的全部发电设备容量的一半，将占第一个五年计划期间新增加的全部发电设备容量的40％。
    今年全国开工建设的发电、输电和变电等工程项目，也比过去任何一年都多。加上前几年开工建设的工程，今年共计将有一百一十九个限额以上的工程同时施工。这些工程建成以后的全部生产能力，将比我国目前全部发电设备能力还多。
    我国电力工业在第一个五年计划期间就有了很大发展，五年内新增加的发电设备容量，比1952年原有的全部发电设备容量还多；十一万伏以上高压输电线，也比过去增加了二倍以上。但是因为各地工业用的和民用的电增长更快，在第一个五年计划期间，仍有不少地区出现了缺电现象。今年由于全国性生产和建设高潮的到来，缺电现象将继续存在。因此，今年电力工业的基本建设，一方面要尽可能地满足缺电地区的需要，另一方面积极为新的工业地区做好准备。例如在东北地区，今年就将有十八个限额以上的火力发电厂同时施工。其中除加快建设正在施工的辽宁和吉林两个大电厂以外，富拉尔基、阜新、抚顺、大连、锦西、本溪等电厂，也都将进行新的扩建，并且争取在今年或明年就要发电。哈尔滨、抚顺、大连等地，还将建设新的电厂。在华北地区，新建的北京热电站、包头第二热电厂、太原热电厂和石景山发电厂的扩建工程等，今年都将开始投入生产；包头第一热电厂和保定热电厂，也将在今年开工兴建。除此以外，今年在许多新的工业地区，如西北宝鸡、西安、乌鲁木齐，西南的成都、昆明、贵阳、重庆，中南的洛阳、株洲等，也都有不少新建和扩建电厂将在今年投入生产和开工建设。
    为了积极地利用我国丰富的水力资源，今年水电建设的投资额也比去年增加了将近一倍。列入今年国家建设计划的限额以上的水电站中，除了过去已经开工的三门峡、新安江、以礼河等水电站以外，辽宁省浑江的桓仁、四川省泯江的紫坪铺，湖南省资水的柘溪等地，今年都将开始建设新水电站。这些新水电站的规模比较大，装机容量都在二十五万瓩以上。
