Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 7th: Since the New Year, famous opera actors Zhou Xinfang, Yuan Xuefen, Ding Shi'e and others have led performance teams to perform for farmers in the suburbs, and have been warmly welcomed by the farmers.

When sixty-four-year-old Peking Opera performing artist Zhou Xinfang performed his famous play "Xu Ce Runs the City" for farmers in the eastern suburbs, an elderly farmer said: "I knew the name 'Qilin Tong' when I was young, but in the old society, farmers couldn't afford to watch operas. After liberation, farmers can not only watch operas, but Zhou Xinfang personally brings the opera to our door to watch, which is really remarkable." Before the performance, Zhou Xinfang was worried that the farmers would not understand Peking Opera. He was very moved when he saw the farmers appreciating their performance.

    上海戏曲演员为工农演出
    据新华社上海7日电　新年以来，著名戏曲演员周信芳、袁雪芬、丁是娥等纷纷带领演出队为郊区农民演出，受到农民的热烈欢迎。
    当六十四岁的京剧表演艺术家周信芳用他的拿手好戏“徐策跑城”等为东郊农民演出时，一个老年农民说：“麒麟童”的名字我年轻时就晓得，但旧社会农民那里看得起戏。解放后农民不但能看戏了，周信芳还亲自把戏送上门来给我们看，真是了不起的事。周信芳在演出前曾担心农民看不懂京戏，他看到农民欣赏他们的表演后，很受感动。
