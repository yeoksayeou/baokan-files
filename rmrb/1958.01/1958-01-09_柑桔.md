Small Information

    China's climate and soil are very suitable for the growth of citrus fruits. Citrus fruits are cultivated from Hainan Island in the south to the Yangtze River basin in the north. It is estimated that about one-third of the world's area suitable for citrus cultivation is in China.
    There are many types of citrus fruits, including: mandarin oranges, tangerines, sweet oranges, pomelos, lemons, kumquats, etc. Each type has many varieties. For example, the tangerines produced in Huangyan include: early tangerines, "local early" tangerines, late tangerines, golden tangerines, vermilion tangerines, etc.
    Citrus fruits originated in China. Over thousands of years, Chinese farmers have worked hard to cultivate many excellent citrus varieties. The "Shantou Honey Mandarin" and Zhao Mandarin (also known as Banana Mandarin) are among the best varieties in the world. The goose-egg mandarin from Jiangjin, Sichuan, the "local early" tangerine from Huangyan, Zhejiang (also known as Tiantaishan tangerine), the Nanfeng honey tangerine (also known as Tribute tangerine) from Jiangxi, and the Shatin pomelo are all famous and excellent varieties.
    The nutritional value of citrus fruits is the highest among general fruits. They contain a variety of minerals and are rich in vitamins. The vitamin C content of general citrus fruits is about four times that of apples.
    Citrus fruits are one of the main export fruits. Since liberation, the export volume of citrus fruits has increased year by year. If 1950 is taken as 100, 1956 is 1,503, an increase of more than ten times.
    The economic value of citrus fruits is very high. Exporting one ton can be exchanged for two tons of steel.

    柑桔
    我国气候土质很适宜柑桔生长，南迄海南岛北至长江流域都有柑桔栽培。据估计，全世界宜于栽培柑桔的面积，有三分之一左右在我国。
    柑桔的种类很多，其中包括：柑、桔、甜橙、柚子、柠檬、金桔等。在每一种当中又有许多品种，以黄岩产的桔子说就有：早桔、“本地早”桔、槾桔、金钱桔、朱红桔等。
    柑桔原产我国。几千年来，经过我国农民辛勤劳动，培育出许多柑桔优良品种。“汕头蜜柑”和招柑（又叫蕉柑），都是世界上最好的品种。四川江津的鹅蛋柑、浙江黄岩“本地早”桔（又叫天台山桔）、江西南丰蜜桔（又叫贡桔）、沙田柚子等，都是著名的优良品种。
    柑桔的营养价值在一般水果当中数第一位，它含有多种矿物质和丰富的维生素。一般柑桔维生素丙的含量相当苹果的四倍。
    柑桔是主要出口的果品之一。解放以后柑桔的出口量逐年增加，如以1950年为一百，1956年是1，503，增长十几倍。
    柑桔的经济价值很高，出口一吨可以换回钢材两吨。
