Xinhua News Agency, January 16th dispatch from Moscow via TASS: The Soviet Union's per capita production of electricity, steel, and cement has now exceeded the average level of all capitalist countries combined.

The high-speed development of the economy enables Soviet industrial production to continuously and rapidly approach the production level of the most industrially developed capitalist country – the United States. This can be seen even from a comparison of the production of some of the most important industrial products in the Soviet Union and the United States over the past three years. For example, in 1955, Soviet coal production was 80% of that of the United States, 88% in 1956, and already reached 97% in 1957. In the above three years, Soviet steel production was 42%, 47%, and 48% of U.S. steel production, respectively. It is estimated that the Soviet Union will be able to surpass the current production level of the United States in the most important industrial products within the next fifteen years.

Generally speaking, the Soviet Union will need approximately six or seven years to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita production of agricultural and livestock products. In the next few years, the Soviet Union will catch up with the United States in terms of per capita production of milk, meat, and fats; milk production will be able to exceed the United States in the shortest period. In the past three years, the average growth rate of Soviet milk production was 10.5%, while it was only 1.6% in the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, January 16th dispatch from Krasnodar via TASS: A drilling team in the Azov Sea region of the Soviet Union achieved the world's highest drilling speed last year.

The drilling team led by drilling expert Solokhin drilled 39,187 meters last year, and another team led by Apanasenko drilled 39,163 meters.

They used eight-hour electric turbo drills to sink wells in sandy and clayey areas. Drilling was carried out to a depth of 1,750 meters.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th dispatch from New York: According to reports in the American press, U.S. industrial production is continuing to shrink.

"U.S. News & World Report" quoted figures from the Federal Reserve System Administration as saying that the current U.S. industrial production index has fallen to 123 (with 1947-1949 as 100), compared to 146 a year ago. The magazine said that the national industrial production level has fallen by 8% in the last thirteen weeks. Currently, the steel industry, the automobile industry, and other industrial sectors are continuing to reduce production.

Orders for heavy industrial products and machinery manufacturing products from industrial and commercial companies have fallen by more than 11% compared to the end of 1956. The production level of the automobile industry in early January this year was 15% lower than the level in the same period last year. Last week, the operating rate of the ferrous metallurgy industry only reached 56.1% of its production capacity.

The American Iron and Steel Institute announced that it has decided to no longer publish weekly forecasts of the U.S. steel industry's operating rate. For more than twenty-four years, this research institute has published the approximate operating rate of U.S. ferrous metallurgy factories at the beginning of each week. These data are an important indicator of the condition of the U.S. steel industry.

A survey report on the production of thirty important U.S. industries published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on January 12 indicated that the production of machine tools, copper, mining machinery, industrial boilers, and railway equipment in the United States will all decline this year. It pointed out that the production of the aircraft industry was also originally going to decrease this year, but like some other industries, it will receive substantial government military spending support.

The number of unemployed continues to grow. According to official statistics released by the Labor Department on the 14th, in December 1957, the number of unemployed in the United States increased to 3,374,000, an increase of 186,000 from November of the same year and an increase of 660,000 from December 1956. The Labor Department said that the unemployment figure for December 1957 was the highest unemployment figure since February 1950. In some important industrial areas, such as the Detroit industrial area, 8.8% of the total workforce is now unemployed, while in New York State and Seattle, it is 10%.

The increase in unemployment and the decline in residents' living standards are also reflected in the shrinking of retail trade, which in turn has led to a further reduction in the production of industrial sectors producing consumer goods.

The domestic economic situation is so serious that Liu Jike, editor of the "Commercial Daily," expressed concern in an article published on January 13, saying that 1958 may be "a year of testing" for the entire U.S. economic system. Liu Jike concluded that the decline in domestic production levels will continue.

### 按人口平均计算电、钢和水泥产量  苏联超过资本主义国家平均水平  美国工业生产不断缩减失业人数增加

    按人口平均计算电、钢和水泥产量
    苏联超过资本主义国家平均水平
    美国工业生产不断缩减失业人数增加
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联按人口平均计算的电力、钢和水泥的产量，现在已经超过了目前所有资本主义国家按人口总数平均计算的水平。
    经济的高速度发展使得苏联的工业生产能够不断地和迅速地接近工业最发达的资本主义国家——美国的生产水平。即使是从最近三年来苏美两国的某些最重要的工业品产量的比较中也可以看出这一点。例如，1955年，苏联的采煤量为美国的80％，1956年为88％，而1957年已经达到97％。在上述三年中，苏联钢产量先后为美国钢产量的42％、47％和48％。据计算，苏联在今后十五年内在最重要的工业产品上就能够超过美国目前的生产水平。
    总的说来，苏联大约需要六、七年的时间就可以在按人口平均计算的农畜产品数量上赶上和超过生产最发达的资本主义国家。在最近几年中，苏联就将在按人口平均计算的牛奶、肉类和油脂产量方面赶上美国；牛奶产量将能够在最短期间内超过美国。在过去三年中，苏联牛奶生产的平均增长速度为10.5％，而美国只有1.6％。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社克拉斯诺达讯：苏联亚速海地带的一个油田的钻探队去年的钻井速度达到了世界最高水平。
    钻探能手索洛欣的工作队在去年一年中钻了三万九千一百八十七公尺，另一个以阿帕纳先科为首的工作队钻了三万九千一百六十三公尺。
    他们是在沙土和粘土地带用八时电动透平钻探机凿井的。钻探在深达一千七百五十公尺地方进行。
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：据美国报刊报道，美国工业生产在继续缩减。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”引联邦储备系统管理局的数字说，目前美国工业生产指数已经下降到一百二十三（以1947—1949年为一百），一年以前是一百四十六。这家杂志说，最近十三个星期来，全国工业生产的水平下降了8％。现在炼钢工业、汽车工业以及其他的工业部门的生产正在继续缩减中。
    工商业公司对重工业产品和机器制造业产品的订货比1956年底下降了11％以上。今年1月初汽车工业的生产水平比去年同一时期的水平降低了15％。上周黑色冶金工业的开工率总共只达到它生产能力的56.1％。
    美国钢铁研究所宣布，它决定今后不再发表美国炼钢工业开工率的每周预报。二十四年多以来，这个研究所在每周之初一直发表美国黑色冶金工厂的大体开工率。这些资料是美国炼钢工业状况的重要指标。
    美国商务部1月12日发表的对美国三十种重要工业生产情况的调查报告指出，今年美国的机床、铜、采矿机械、工业用锅炉和铁路设备的生产都要下降。它指出，飞机工业的生产今年本来也要减少，但是它像其他某些工业一样，将得到大量的政府军事开支的支持。
    失业人数继续增长。据劳工部在14日发表的官方统计，1957年12月，美国失业人数增加到三百三十七万四千人，比同年11月增加了十八万六千人，比1956年12月增加了六十六万人。劳工部说，1957年12月份的失业数字是1950年2月以来的最高失业数字。在一些重要的工业区，如底特律工业区，现在有占工人总数8.8％的失业工人，而在纽约州和西雅图则有10％。
    失业的增长和居民生活水平的下降也表现在零售贸易的萎缩上面，而这又导致了生产消费品的工业部门生产的进一步缩减。
    国内经济状况是那么严重，以至“商务日报”编辑刘吉克在1月13日所发表的一篇文章中表示耽心说，1958年可能将是美国整个经济制度受到“考验的一年”。刘吉克得出结论说，国内生产水平的下降将继续下去。
