    Thoughts on an Untitled Subject
    Zhong Huai
    Perhaps because the hand that wields the pen and the hand that wields the hoe have never been the same, we hear the phrase "abandon the pen and take up the plow" amidst the calls for cadres to go down to the countryside.
    Those who used to hold pens, now determined to "take up farming," should of course be encouraged. However, there's no need to "abandon" the pen. Don't you see that the number of people who previously could only hold a hoe but now have a fountain pen in their breast pocket is increasing day by day? What we need is the combination of the hoe and the pen, as well as the combination of the pen and the hoe. So, let's "bring the pen to the farm"!
    The employees of the Shanghai Meilin Canned Food Factory criticized the leadership's indifference to many wasteful phenomena: they don't feel the pain of losing one yuan of public money as they would if they lost one yuan of their own.
    This truly hits the nail on the head regarding the reason why the serious wasteful phenomena in some enterprises, schools, and institutions have been difficult to overcome for a long time.
    It is hoped that all leaders, large and small, as well as those being led, will imagine that it is their own yuan when spending one yuan of public money. Even if we discount that, it would be very good if they imagined that it was their own yuan when spending ten yuan of public money.

    大概是因为挥舞笔杆的手和挥动锄头的手从来就不是同一双手的原故吧，在干部下放声中，我们听到了“投笔从农”的说法。
    过去拿笔杆的，现在决心“从农”，当然应该鼓励。不过，那笔倒是无需“投”的。君不见原先只能手拿锄头而现在胸前挂着自来水笔的人，已经一天天多起来了。我们需要的，既是锄头同笔杆的结合，也是笔杆同锄头的结合。那么，还是“带笔从农”吧！
    上海梅林罐头食品厂的职工这样批评领导上对许多浪费现象漠不关心：还没有像自己失掉一元钱心疼。
    真是一语道破了某些企业、学校、机关浪费现象严重而又长期不得克服的原因。
    希望大大小小的领导者，还有被领导者，在开支公家的一元钱的时候，设想这是自己的一元钱。即使打个折扣，在开支公家十元钱的时候，设想这是自己的一元钱，那也很好。
