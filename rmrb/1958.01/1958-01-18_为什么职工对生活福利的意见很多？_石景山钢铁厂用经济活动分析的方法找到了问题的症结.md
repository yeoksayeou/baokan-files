Why do workers have so many opinions on living welfare?
    ——Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant used economic activity analysis to find the crux of the problem
      Organized by Cai Youlin, Labor and Wages Department, Ministry of Metallurgical Industry
    During the rectification movement, the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant raised many criticisms and opinions on the issue of living welfare. These can be roughly divided into three aspects: First, the contradiction between needs and possibilities; second, unreasonable phenomena in the allocation and use of welfare expenses; third, shortcomings in the system and management. Most of these criticisms and opinions are correct, but some opinions need to be studied, explained, or are wrong. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant used economic activity analysis to find clear standards of right and wrong, thereby correctly carrying out rectification.
    In the economic activity analysis, the distribution of net output value was first grasped to clarify the relationship between living welfare and value creation. Since 1952, the distribution of average annual net output value created by employees is shown in the following table:
      (Note: 1. The portion returned to the national treasury includes taxes; 2. Enterprise bonus funds have been distributed into relevant items; 3. Labor protection supplies include clothing, shoes, hats, cool drinks, and union funds; 4. The 1953 planned remittance was not completed, so the portion returned to the national treasury is lower than in 1952.)

    From the analysis of the above table, it can be seen that:
    1. The wages, bonuses, and welfare of workers are increasing every year. Wages and bonuses increase by an average of 14% per year, and in 1956 increased by 62.9% compared to 1952; expenses for welfare undertakings increased by an average of 16.2% per year, and in 1956 increased by 76.7% compared to 1952. This speed exceeds the growth of net output value and is even faster than the growth of the portion remitted to the state.
    2. From 1953 to 1956, the average expenses for wages, bonuses, and welfare undertakings accounted for 37.5% of the net output value, reaching 39.4% when labor protection supplies are added; the portion remitted to the state for construction accounted for 60.6%. In other words, two-fifths of the wealth created by this factory has been directly distributed to the workers by the enterprise.
    Such a growth rate and distribution ratio, given our country's current low level of productivity and weak foundation, is not slow or small, but rather too fast and too high.
    The growth of welfare facilities also depends on the correctness of the allocation and use of welfare expenses. After calculating the distribution of net output value, the portion used for welfare undertakings should be further analyzed in depth. The factory's average annual welfare expenses reached more than 2.4 million yuan. In 1956, it was as high as 3,726,000 yuan, which could be used to build 74,000 square meters of housing, enough to accommodate more than 2,000 workers. The factory's welfare expenses include six parts:
    Housing expenses paid from non-operating income and expenses and within costs totaled more than 1,239,000 yuan, accounting for 33.7% of the total welfare expenses;
    Supplementary wages paid from within costs (including medical funds, labor insurance funds, cultural and educational funds, and welfare funds for canteens, nurseries, bathhouses, etc.) totaled more than 1,517,000 yuan, accounting for 40.71% of the total;
    The welfare portion of the enterprise bonus fund totaled more than 470,000 yuan, accounting for 12.62%;
    Subsidies for spare-time schools from non-operating income and expenses totaled more than 100,300 yuan, accounting for 2.77%;
    Cultural, educational, health, public utilities, and depreciation expenses from enterprise management fees (transferred to costs) totaled 191,000 yuan, accounting for 5.13%;
    Other – heating coal subsidies and coal washing stones used as fuel totaled 204,000 yuan, accounting for 5.49%.
    Housing expenses and supplementary wages account for the largest proportion of welfare expenses, yet workers have the most opinions on these two items. What is the reason? A more in-depth analysis of these two items of expenditure is needed:
    First, analysis of housing expenses:
      Housing expenses totaled more than 1,239,000 yuan, of which the specific items are:
    Subsidies for workers renting civilian housing 248,400 yuan;
    Housing depreciation 594,500 yuan;
    Housing surtax 80,600 yuan;
    Water and electricity fees 55,100 yuan;
    Medium and small repair costs 76,300 yuan;
    Management fees (wages and miscellaneous expenses) 172,700 yuan;
    Housing insurance premiums 12,100 yuan.
    Housing expenses only have expenditures and no income. Workers living in enterprise housing not only do not pay rent (rent was charged in 1957, but only 4 to 8 fen per square meter), but also water and electricity are provided free of charge by the public, and the houses are repaired by the public. The state bears more than 0.59 yuan per square meter (with significant waste and excessively high depreciation standards). Those who cannot live in public housing and rent civilian housing are given housing subsidies by the enterprise. Housing expenses are paid according to the actual needs of the current year, thus separating welfare from production. The proportion of housing expenses in the profits remitted over the years is as follows: 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 4.36% 12.22% 10.3% 6.68% 6.02%
    The proportions are very irregular. In 1953, the planned remittance of profits was not completed, but housing expenses increased with the increase in housing (invested by the state in 1952 and completed in 1953). This is mainly due to the enterprise's "taking over" management policy for workers' living welfare. The same is true for other welfare undertakings. Taking nurseries as an example, it is stipulated that children enter the nursery two months after birth and do not leave until they are sent to the employee's children's primary school at the age of seven. The enterprise supports them for six years and ten months (parents only pay for the children's food and 0.6 yuan of miscellaneous expenses per month). The enterprise spends approximately 40,000 yuan per year, with the enterprise bearing an average of 1,640 yuan per child (six years and ten months). It is impossible to "take over" the entire living welfare of all factory workers. In the case of children, 10,116 were born in the three years from 1954 to 1956, but nurseries currently only accommodate 203 children. This makes workers feel that the distribution of benefits is not equal. After simply categorizing the expenses used for welfare according to the actual usage of the workers, the following results are obtained:
    The average worker currently living in public housing enjoys 380.2 yuan;
    The average worker renting housing enjoys 263.4 yuan;
    The average worker whose family is in the countryside and who lives in a single dormitory enjoys 202.7 yuan;
    The average worker who owns their own housing enjoys 193.3 yuan.
    Workers living in enterprise housing not only save trouble and worry, with everything taken care of by the public, but also enjoy welfare benefits that are about twice as much as those with their own housing or whose families are in the countryside. This is just an average. In the typical survey materials, happiness and hardship are very disparate, with the highest and lowest differing by more than ten times. Such a wide difference naturally prompts workers whose families are in the countryside to request to bring their families to the factory (and can receive subsidies from the enterprise after coming to the factory), and prompts those who own their own housing or rent civilian housing to sell or return their houses and squeeze into public housing. Having children leads to requests to enter nurseries. When requests cannot be met or are resolved slowly, this generates dissatisfaction with the leadership, with people frequently causing trouble in the housing department. Workers hand over all their difficulties to the state, which is the consequence of "taking over."
    Second, analysis of supplementary wages:
    The welfare fund and medical fund within the supplementary wages totaled 1,100,668.81 yuan in expenses and 194,963 yuan in income. Specific usage items are as follows:

    Through analysis of the above table, it was found that the proportion of service personnel wages and drug costs is the largest, reaching 58.1%—71.8%. The number of service personnel is obviously high compared with other enterprises. There is one cook for every 25 to 35 workers (better enterprises have one for every 50 to 70 workers). The reason is that the canteens are scattered. In addition to the large canteens, each single dormitory has its own canteen, even though they are less than 40 to 50 meters apart. The proportion of medical personnel also reaches 2.57 per thousand. The high proportion of drug costs is due to the lax implementation of the system and the lack of proper education for some unreasonable workers. Some workers demand expensive or tonic drugs as soon as they see a doctor, or they will make trouble. Sometimes, it is not the doctor's prescription but the "patient" who makes the decision. After grasping these materials, the sick leave wages in the supplementary wages were re-analyzed. In 1956, a total of 287,678 yuan was paid, accounting for 3.13% of the total wages. Sick leave wages have been increasing over the years, but the workers' incidence rate has been declining year by year:
    Medical quality is constantly improving, but more and more workers are receiving sick leave wages. This shows that the factory's ideological education work for workers is still very weak, and the assistance to some backward workers is insufficient, allowing them to only consider their personal interests and exploit loopholes in the national system (because in order to take care of workers' actual income, the labor insurance regulations stipulate that sick leave wages are paid according to the average piece-rate wages of the previous three months). Some people "play sick" when they encounter more tiring work or fail to meet the quota, forcing doctors to issue sick leave slips. Some people, even though they have recovered from their illness and are able to participate in light labor, are unwilling to work, or "stay" in the hospital and refuse to be discharged. Although this is only the case for individual workers, the impact is very bad, making the actual income of those who do not work more than the income of those who do work.
    Through the above economic activity analysis, it is clear that the living welfare of workers has greatly improved in recent years. The reason for the contradictions between the leadership and the led within the enterprise, as well as the excessive demands and abnormal phenomena, is precisely because the enterprise's welfare undertakings have developed too quickly, exceeding the capacity that the country can bear. Needs exceed possibilities (the financial income cannot "take over" the living welfare of workers, while the actual expenditure is implementing the "taking over" policy). Enterprise leaders rarely analyze and study welfare work (systems and expenditures) on weekdays, nor do they disclose the financial situation to workers. Workers do not understand the actual situation of the enterprise's production and welfare, the distinction between right and wrong is unclear, and the opinions they raise are easily biased towards comparing people or starting from personal interests, resulting in dissatisfaction with welfare undertakings and dissatisfaction with leaders. In addition, insufficient ideological education is carried out for backward workers on weekdays, leading to bad phenomena of taking advantage of the public and disrupting labor discipline. Only by correcting the "take over" management policy, implementing reasonable burdens, and turning some welfare undertakings into enterprises, will it be possible to use part of the welfare expenses to develop permanent, collective welfare facilities, so that workers' welfare undertakings can gradually improve with the development of production, and it will be possible to eliminate contradictions in workers' living welfare. This is the conclusion. (Attached tables and charts)

    为什么职工对生活福利的意见很多？
    ——石景山钢铁厂用经济活动分析的方法找到了问题的症结
      冶金工业部劳动工资司　蔡幼林整理
    在整风运动中，石景山钢铁厂的职工对生活福利问题提出了很多的批评和意见。归纳起来大致可分为三个方面：一、需要与可能的矛盾；二、福利费用的分配和使用存在着不合理的现象；三、制度与管理方面有缺点。这些批评和意见绝大部分是正确的，但也有部分意见是需要研究、解释或是错误的。石景山钢铁厂通过经济活动分析的方法找出了明确的是非标准，从而正确地进行了整改。
    在经济活动分析中，首先抓住了净产值的分配，搞清生活福利与创造价值的关系。从1952年以来，职工创造的每人每年平均净产值分配情况如下表：
      （注：1、归国库部分内已包括税金，2、企业奖励基金已分摊各有关项内，3、劳保用品等项内包括衣鞋、帽、清凉饮料以及工会经费，4、1953年上缴计划没有完成，故归国库部分低于1952年。）
    从上表分析，可以看出：
    一、职工的工资、奖励和福利，每年都在提高。工资和奖励平均每年提高14％，1956年比1952年提高62.9％；用于福利事业的费用平均每年提高16.2％，1956年比1952年提高76.7％。这样的速度是超过了净产值的增长；比上缴给国家部分的增长速度更为迅速。
    二、1953年到1956年平均用于工资、奖励和福利事业的费用占净产值的37.5％，加上劳动保护用品后达39.4％；上缴给国家用来建设的部分占60.6％。换句话说，这个厂所创造的财富中，已有五分之二直接由企业分配给了职工。
    这样的增长速度和分配比例，在我国目前的生产力水平还很低，家底子不雄厚的情况下，不是慢或少，而是过快过高了。
    福利设施的增长，还取决于福利费用的分配和使用的正确程度。计算出净产值的分配后，应对用于福利事业的部分再深入分析。该厂平均每年支出的福利费用达二百四十余万元。1956年高达三百七十二万六千元，用这钱可以修建住宅七万四千平方公尺，可以供二千余名职工居住。这个厂的福利费支出包括六个部分：
    由营业外损益项下及成本内支付的住宅事业费计一百二十三万九千余元，占福利费用总数的33.7％；
    由成本内开支的附加工资（其中包括医疗基金，劳保基金，文教基金及用于食堂、托儿所、浴室等的福利基金）计一百五十一万七千余元，占总数的40.71％；
    企业奖励基金中用于福利部分计四十七万余元，占12.62％；
    由营业外损益项下贴补业余学校计十万零三千余元，占2.77％；
    由企业管理费（转成本）的文教、卫生、公用事业、折旧费计十九万一千元，占5.13％；
    其它——取暖煤贴与供作燃料用的洗煤石计二十万四千元，占5.49％。
    福利费用的组成中以住宅事业费及附加工资占的比重最大，然而职工对这两项的意见最多。这是什么原因？需要具体地对这两项经费进一步深入分析：
    第一，住宅事业费用的分析：
      住宅事业费用共计支出一百二十三万九千余元，其中具体项目是：
    补贴租民房职工房贴　二十四万八千四百元；
    住宅折旧　五十九万四千五百元；
    房屋附加税　八万零六百元；
    水电费　五万五千一百元；
    中、小修理费　七万六千三百元；
    管理费（工资及杂费）　十七万二千七百元；
    房屋保险费　一万二千一百元。
    住宅事业费用只有支出，没有收入。职工住企业的住宅不但不收房租（1957年已收费，但每平方公尺只收四分到八分钱），而且水电也由公家免费供应，房子坏了由公家修理，每平方公尺由国家负担五角九分多（其中浪费很大，折旧标准也过高）。住不上公家住宅而租民房住的由企业发给房贴。住宅事业费是按照本年度内实际的需要支付的，因而使福利离开了生产。历年来住宅事业费占上缴利润的比例如下：1952年1953年1954年1955年1956年4.36％12.22％10.3％6.68％6.02％
    比例数很不规律，其中1953年上交利润计划没有完成，而住宅事业费却随着住宅（国家在1952年投资，1953年交工的）增长而增长了。这主要是企业对职工的生活福利采取了“包下来”的管理方针所形成的。在其它福利事业上也是如此，以托儿所为例，规定儿童自出生后二个月入所，直至七岁送入职工子弟小学后方出所，由企业扶养六年十个月（家长只交儿童伙食费及每月六角杂费），每年企业支出约四万余元，平均每名儿童由企业负担一千六百四十元（六年十个月）。对全厂职工的生活福利要全包是包不下来的。以儿童来说，从1954年至1956年三年内出生了一万零一百一十六名，而现在托儿所只收了二百零三名儿童。这样就使职工感到苦乐不均。简单地将用于福利部分的费用按职工实际使用情况分类后，得出以下的结果：
    现住公家住宅的平均每名职工享受三百八十元二角；
    租用房的平均每名职工享受二百六十三元四角；
    家属在农村、本人住单身宿舍的平均每名职工享受二百零二元七角；
    自己有住宅的平均每名职工享受一百九十三元三角。
    住企业住宅的职工不但省事、省心，一切都有公家负责，而且福利待遇要比自有房的或家在农村的职工多享受一倍左右。这只是个平均数，在典型调查的材料中，苦、乐十分悬殊，最高、最低竟差十倍以上。相差这样悬殊，自然促使家在农村的职工要求接家属来（来厂后生活困难还可由企业补助），促使自有房的或租民房的卖掉或退掉房子，挤向公家住宅。有了孩子就要求入托。当无法满足要求或解决较慢时，就产生了对领导不满的情绪，在房产科大吵大闹的大有其人。职工将自己的困难全交给了国家，这是“包下来”的后果。
    其次，对附加工资的分析：
    附加工资中福利基金和医疗基金共计支出一百一十万零六千六百八十一元，收入十九万四千九百六十三元。具体使用项目如下：
    通过上表分析，找出了服务人员的工资及药品费占的比重最大，达58.1％—71.8％，服务人员在同其它企业对比之下显然是多了。每二十五到三十五个职工就有一个炊事员（较好企业为五十到七十人），原因是食堂分散，除了有大食堂以外，每个单身宿舍虽相隔不到四、五十公尺，也各有各的食堂。医务人员的比例亦达千分之二点五七。药品费的支出比重大，原因是制度执行不严，对某些无理取闹的职工没有适当地进行教育。有的职工一去看病就要求开贵重药品或补药，不然就吵闹，有时甚至不是医师处方而是“病人”作主。掌握了这些材料，又重新对附加工资中病伤假工资作了分析。1956年共计支付二十八万七千六百七十八元，占工资总额3.13％。病伤假工资是历年增长的，但职工的发病率却逐年下降：
    医疗质量在不断地改进和提高，而领病假工资的职工却越来越多，这说明了厂里对职工的思想教育工作还很薄弱，对某些落后职工的帮助不够，使他们只考虑个人的利益而钻了国家制度的空子（因为为了照顾职工实际收入，劳保条例规定病假工资按前三个月的平均计件工资支付）。有的人遇到较累的工作或达不到定额时，就“泡病号”，强迫医师开病假单。有的人病愈以后虽已能参加轻微劳动，但也不愿劳动，或“泡”在医院里不出院。这虽是个别职工，但影响很坏，使不劳动的实际所得比劳动的收入还多。
    通过以上经济活动分析，明确了几年来职工的生活福利是大大地提高了。所以会产生企业内部领导与被领导之间的矛盾，所以会有过高的要求以及不正常的现象，这正是由于企业的福利事业发展过快，超过了国家所能负担的能力，需要超过了可能（财务收入上对职工生活福利是包不下来，而实际支出上执行的是包下来的方针）。企业领导平时对福利工作（制度和经费）很少分析和研究，也不向职工交家底，职工们不了解企业的生产和福利的实际情况，是非不明确，提的意见就容易偏向于人比人或从个人利益出发，对福利事业不满，对领导不满。加上平时对落后工人思想教育作得不够，而发生占公家便宜，破坏劳动纪律的不良现象。只有纠正“包下来”的管理方针，实行合理负担，将某些福利事业改成企业化后，才有可能将其中一部分福利费用用来发展永久性的、集体性的福利设施，使职工的福利事业随着生产的发展而逐步提高，才有可能消除职工在生活福利上的矛盾。这就是结论。（附图表）
