    One day in early January, Chairman Mao came to Xiaoying Lane in Hangzhou to inspect patriotic hygiene work. He first strolled into the large courtyard at No. 61.

    At the threshold of the gate of No. 61, two girls were concentrating on playing chess. Chairman Mao gently walked up to them and said:
    "I've come here to take a look at your hygiene work, is that okay?"
    "Okay! Okay! Welcome!" the girls replied cheerfully in unison.
    One of the girls, Dai Guifang, a middle school student, saw that the guest who came in looked like Chairman Mao, so she stood up and greeted him warmly.
    Chairman Mao continued:
    "Would you be my guides and take me on a tour?"

    Chairman Mao and the girls walked side by side into the aisle, looked at the dining table there, and then looked at the food cabinet, all as clean as if they had just been scrubbed. Chairman Mao turned to ask the people gathered in the room:
    "Do you have flies here? Do you have mosquitoes?"
    "No flies, and very few mosquitoes," everyone replied proudly.
    Chairman Mao smiled and nodded, then walked into the kitchen. This kitchen was shared by a dozen or so households in the courtyard. Chairman Mao carefully looked at the neatly arranged pots and pans, coal stoves, and surrounding cooking utensils, and then walked to a house.

    This house was very tidy, with several stacks of books on the table. This was the home of young worker Zheng Zhaoyong. Chairman Mao sat down here and asked Zheng Zhaoyong with concern what books he was reading and where he worked. When Chairman Mao saw a clean washbasin with the words "Awarded to Advanced Producer" written on it, knowing it was an award received by Zheng Zhaoyong's older brother, Zheng Zhaoji, Chairman Mao said happily, "Your family is all very good."

    The news that Chairman Mao had come to Xiaoying Lane to inspect hygiene immediately spread to every corner of the lane. Adults and children rushed outside No. 61, some even forgetting to eat. They stood on both sides of the lane, welcoming Chairman Mao with applause like spring thunder.

    Chairman Mao then walked into the courtyard of No. 56. The houses here were a little better than the previous one. The living room and bedroom were bright and clean, spotless. Chairman Mao walked across the newly scrubbed floor and stopped next to the courtyard. He lifted the lid of one of the five water tanks lined up in a row and looked at it carefully. Cheng Yu, the health committee member of the Xiaoying Lane residential area standing next to him, explained to Chairman Mao: The tank contains rainwater, and fish are raised inside so there are no mosquito larvae.
    Chairman Mao praised this method as good.

    Chairman Mao walked into the vegetable garden behind the house. In the left corner of the vegetable garden was a manure tank storing human manure and urine for watering the vegetables.
    Chairman Mao walked to the side of the manure tank. Cheng Yu opened the lid of the manure tank and said that this manure tank does not breed maggots even in summer.
    Chairman Mao asked, "How do you prevent maggots?"
    Cheng Yu replied, "We sprinkle lime on it, once every three days."
    Chairman Mao smiled and nodded.

    Before leaving, Chairman Mao also encouraged everyone, saying, "You are doing a good job with your hygiene work."

    Next, Chairman Mao visited the large courtyard at No. 42. This was a house built during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era. Although the house was old, there was no garbage on the dirt ground, and not even a single weed could be found on the uneven cobblestone road.

    After looking at the bedrooms of two residents here, Chairman Mao came to the home of military family member Ju Suwu. There were wintersweet flowers in a vase on old Mrs. Ju Suwu's table, and the glass window was spotless and transparently bright.

    Chairman Mao saw that there were no mosquito nets on either bed in the room and asked with concern, "Without mosquito nets, are there no mosquitoes?" Someone immediately told him: Even in summer, there are very few mosquitoes here.

    Chairman Mao left the courtyard with satisfaction.

    As soon as Chairman Mao appeared at the entrance, cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao, Long live Chairman Mao" rang out from the crowd. Countless hands were extended, vying to shake hands with Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao walked with a smile, constantly waving to everyone and constantly shaking hands with the people in front of him.

    Xiaoying Lane in Hangzhou has persistently done a good job in patriotic hygiene work and has been rated as a hygiene model unit in Hangzhou for several consecutive years. No infectious patients have been found for more than two years, and the residents are very healthy. The attendance rate of workers living here is also higher than in other residential areas.

    毛主席在杭州查看卫生工作
    新华社记者　伊心恬　浙江日报记者　庞佑中
    1月初旬的一天，毛主席来到杭州市小营巷查看爱国卫生工作。他首先信步走入了六十一号那个大院落。
    在六十一号墙门的门槛边，两个姑娘聚精会神地在下棋。毛主席轻轻地走到她们身边，对她们说：
    “我到这里来看一看你们的卫生工作，好吗？”
    “好！好！欢迎！”姑娘们欢乐地齐声回答。
    其中一个姑娘戴桂芳，是中学生，她看到走进门来的客人面貌像毛主席，便站起身来热情地招呼。
    毛主席接着说：
    “你们做向导，带我参观好吗？”
    毛主席和姑娘们并肩走进过道，看了那里的饭桌，又看了菜橱，都像刚擦洗过一样的干净。毛主席回头问聚集在屋里的人：
    “你们这里有没有苍蝇？有没有蚊子？”
    “没有苍蝇，也很少蚊子。”大家自豪地回答。
    毛主席微笑地点点头，然后走进了厨房。这个厨房是这个院落中上十户居民共用的。毛主席细细地看了放得很整齐的锅灶、煤球炉和周围的烧饭用具，又向一户人家走去。
    这家房子收拾得很整齐，桌上放着几叠书。这是青年工人郑肇勇的家，毛主席在这里坐下来，关怀地问郑肇勇在看些什么书，在哪里工作。当毛主席看到一个洁净的题有“奖给先进生产者”几个字的脸盆，知道是郑肇勇的哥哥郑肇基得到的奖品，毛主席高兴地说：“你们一家都很好。”
    毛主席来到小营巷查看卫生的消息，顿时传遍了这条巷子的每一个角落。大人、小孩都奔到六十一号的外面来，有的甚至顾不得吃饭。他们站在巷子的两旁，用春雷般的鼓掌声来欢迎毛主席。
    毛主席又走进五十六号院子。这里的房子比前面一幢好一些，客厅、卧室窗明几净，一尘不染。毛主席走过刚擦洗了的地板，在天井旁边停下来。他用手揭开一字排列着的五只水缸中的一个缸盖子，仔细瞧了瞧。站在旁边的小营巷居民区卫生委员程瑜向毛主席解释：缸里装的是雨水，里面养了鱼，就没有孑孓。
    毛主席称赞这个办法好。
    毛主席走进了屋后的菜园，在菜园的左角上有一个粪缸贮存着浇菜用的人粪尿。
    毛主席走到了粪缸旁边。程瑜揭开了粪缸盖子说，这个粪缸在夏天也不生蛆。
    毛主席问：“怎样才不生蛆呢？”
    程瑜回答：“用石灰撒在上面，三天撒一次。”
    毛主席笑着点点头。
    毛主席临走时还鼓励大家说：“你们的卫生工作做得不错。”
    接着，毛主席又访问了四十二号大院落。这是一座太平天国时代建筑的房屋。房子虽然古老，但是泥地上没有一点垃圾，连高低不平的碎石子路上也找不出一根杂草。
    毛主席在这里看了两家居民的卧室以后，来到了军属居素吾的家里。居素吾老太太的桌上瓶子里插着腊梅花，玻璃窗上一尘不染，透明得发亮。
    毛主席看到室内两张床都没有挂帐子，关怀地问道：“不挂帐子，没有蚊子吗？”立刻有人告诉他：这里就是在夏天，蚊子也很少。
    毛主席满意地离开了这个院子。
    毛主席一在门口出现，人群中便响起了“毛主席好，毛主席好”的欢呼声。人们伸出了无数的手，争着要和毛主席握手，毛主席微笑地走着，不断向大家挥手致意，不断和跟前的人握手。
    杭州市小营巷坚持不懈地作好爱国卫生工作，已连续几年被评为杭州市的卫生模范单位，近两年多来没有发现过一个传染病人，居民都很健康。住在这里的工人的出勤率也比别的居民区高。
