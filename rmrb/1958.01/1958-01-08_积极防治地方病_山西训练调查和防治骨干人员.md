Actively Prevent and Control Endemic Diseases

Shanxi Trains Key Personnel for Investigation and Prevention

(Our report) In order to "eliminate the four pests" and eradicate diseases such as kala-azar, malaria, and goiter, Shanxi Province has recently intensified its efforts to prevent and control endemic diseases and vector-borne infectious diseases. The Provincial Department of Health has issued a current work plan for the investigation and prevention of endemic diseases and has immediately launched training programs for key personnel involved in the investigation and prevention of endemic diseases throughout the province. As of now, preliminary statistics from 22 cities and counties, including Datong, Daren, Changzhi, and Yangquan, indicate that training for over 600 key personnel for the investigation and prevention of endemic diseases has been completed. The participants in these training programs are mostly medical personnel from grassroots medical and health units in cities and counties, including doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, nurses, disease prevention workers, and health workers. The training period generally lasts about 15 to 20 days. The training content mainly focuses on the symptoms of diseases such as kala-azar, large joint diseases, and goiter, as well as investigation methods and prevention and control measures. Some counties and cities also incorporate lectures on several major infectious diseases prevalent in winter and spring, based on their specific local conditions.

Through this large-scale training effort, these medical personnel are now preliminarily capable of formulating investigation plans for endemic diseases, familiar with investigation content, understand how to fill out investigation forms, and can conduct examinations, differential diagnoses, and prevention and control work for various endemic diseases. This has not only prepared for the province-wide prevention and control of endemic diseases in 1958 but has also attracted the attention of leaders at the city and county levels due to the training of prevention and control personnel in various regions. Various counties and cities have successively established leading organizations for the prevention and control of endemic diseases. For example, seven counties, including Yuci, Tianzhen, and Wuzhai, have established endemic disease prevention and control committees, with many counties led directly by the county party secretary, county head, and deputy county head. Qinshui County has achieved the most significant results. In addition to convening relevant departments to establish a county-wide leading organization for the prevention and control of endemic diseases, the county has also set up two guidance points, eight township investigation stations, ten investigation and prevention institutes, and one investigation team per township. Furthermore, after training the key prevention and control personnel, the county formulated a county-wide prevention and control work plan. The county was divided into three types—plains, hills, and mountains—and a new round of comprehensive survey and statistical assessment was conducted to accurately grasp the scope, area, and number of people affected by endemic diseases throughout the county. It was also decided to convene a county-wide conference on the prevention and control of endemic diseases in January 1958 to adopt a plan for the comprehensive investigation and prevention of endemic diseases, in order to carry out organized investigation and prevention work under leadership throughout the county.

    积极防治地方病
    山西训练调查和防治骨干人员
    本报讯　为了“除四害”和消灭黑热病、疟疾、甲状腺肿等疾病。最近，山西省大力加强了对地方病和虫媒传染病的防治工作，省卫生厅已经颁发了当前地方病调查防治工作计划，并且立即在全省各地普遍展开了关于地方病调查防治骨干人员的训练工作。截至目前为止，据大同、大仁、长治、阳泉等二十二个市、县的初步统计，已先后完成了六百多人的地方病调查防治骨干人员的训练工作。参加这次训练的对象，大都是市、县基层医疗保健单位的中、西医生、护士、防疫员、保健员等医务人员。训练的时间一般在十五到二十天左右。训练内容主要以黑热病、大关节病、甲状腺肿等疾病的症状以及调查方法和防治办法等为教学课程，有些县、市还结合了当地的具体情况讲授了冬、春季的几种主要传染病。
    通过这次大规模的训练工作，这批医务人员已经初步能够制定地方病的调查计划，熟悉调查内容，懂得填写调查表格，能够进行对各种地方病的检查、鉴别诊断和防治工作。不仅为1958年全省开展地方病防治工作做好了准备工作，而且由于各地训练了防治人员，也引起了各市、县领导的重视。各县市都先后成立了地方病防治领导机构。如榆次、天镇、五寨等七个县还建立了地方病防治委员会，许多县都是由县委书记、县长和副县长亲自领导这一工作。沁源县的成绩最为显著，该县除召集有关部门成立了全县地方病防治领导机构外，还设立了两个指导点、八个集镇调查站、十个调查防治所，以及每乡一个调查小组。同时在训练防治骨干之后，又制定了全县防治工作计划。全县按平川、丘陵、山地分为三种类型，重新进行了普查统计摸底工作，确实掌握了全县地方病的发病范围、发病面积和发病人数。并且决定在1958年1月份召开全县地方病防治工作会议，通过普查防治地方病工作计划，以在全县开展有领导有组织的调查防治工作。
