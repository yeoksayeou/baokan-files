　　In the course of carrying out winter exercises, some places have seen the phenomenon of crash training. For example, in some schools in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, students get up at four o'clock in the morning to exercise. Some male students run 16,000 meters a day, and some female students run 9,900 meters a day. In Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, some men ran 134,048 meters in ten days, and women ran 37,200 meters in ten days. This practice of demanding too much too quickly is inappropriate, and is likely to cause injuries and affect health, turning a good thing into a bad thing.

　　Rome wasn't built in a day, and getting your body in shape is not something that can be done overnight. Therefore, when organizing the masses to participate in winter sports (especially long-distance running), all localities should especially emphasize the principle of gradual progress and not be eager for quick results. In particular, people of different genders, ages, and physiques must be treated differently. The relevant departments responsible for leading and organizing the exercises should promptly go deep into the grassroots level to check the exercise situation, and if problems are found, specific guidance should be given. Some units have formulated exercise standards and reward methods, and if they are too high, they should be appropriately revised.

　　In addition, some people's participation in winter sports has hindered production and learning, and this issue should also be brought to the attention of the relevant departments.

　　The purpose of carrying out winter exercises is to improve physical fitness and work and study better. If, during the exercises, the body is damaged, or production and learning are delayed, then the meaning of carrying out sports exercises is lost. Therefore, it is important to prevent deviations and allow winter exercises to develop healthily.

    不要要求过急过高
    曹弟
    在开展冬季锻炼中，有些地方出现了突击锻炼的现象。如湖南衡阳市个别学校学生在早晨四点钟就起床锻炼，男学生有的一天就跑了一万六千公尺，女学生有的一天跑了九千九百公尺；江西赣州市有的男子在十天中跑了十三万四千零四十八公尺，女子在十天中跑了三万七千二百公尺。这种要求过急过高的做法是不妥当的，很可能发生伤害事故和影响健康，把好事变成了坏事。
    冰冻三尺非一日之寒，炼好身体也非朝夕之事。因此各地在组织群众参加冬季体育锻炼（特别是长跑）时，应该特别强调循序渐进的原则，不要急于求成。尤其是性别、年龄和体质不同的人，一定要分别对待。负责领导和组织锻炼的有关部门都要及时地深入基层检查锻炼情况，发现问题，要加以具体指导。有些单位制定的锻炼标准和奖励办法，如有过高的，也应该适当修改。
    另外，在冬季体育锻炼中，有的人因为参加锻炼而妨碍了生产和学习，这个问题也应该引起有关部门的注意。
    开展冬季锻炼的目的，就是要练好身体，更好地工作和学习。要是在锻炼中，反而把身体炼坏了，或者耽误了生产和学习，那就失去了开展体育锻炼的意义。因此，防止发生偏差，让冬季锻炼健康地发展，是很重要的。
