	Fighting the Cold Wave
	Fushi
	Braving the cutting cold wind, I cross the open space, from this workshop to that workshop. The cold inside cannot suppress the fire in my heart; even at nineteen degrees below zero outside, I do not shiver. To deliver the parts to the assemblers, to connect the bloodlines to the hearts of my brothers, I am steaming with heat for the sake of the motherland's leap forward! Can the cold wave stop me?! It's just wishful thinking! Roar! Steam hammers and punch presses, sing together! All the knives and drills...! Our transport vehicle does not sing in a low voice; it opens its throat and drowns out the roaring cold. The temperature line drops, the task line rises; our potential has not yet been tapped at all. What is to be mined—don't rush, when that time comes, it will soar straight into the clouds like a satellite.

    战寒潮
    俯拾迎着刀割的寒风穿过空场，从这边的车间到那边车间，屋内变冷不能压下我的心火，在零下十九度的屋外我也不抖颤。要把零件送到装配者身边，要使血脉接通我弟兄们心房，为祖国飞跃我热到冒烟，寒潮能阻止我么？！真是妄想！轰响吧！汽鎚、冲床，齐唱吧！所有的刀、钻……！我们的运输车不唱低音，它开大嗓子压住咆哮的严寒。温度线下降、任务线升高，我们的潜力还未出动分毫，就要挖掘的——不要着忙，到那时会像卫星一样直上云霄。
