The Arab People Love Chinese Films
Li Weihe

Since 1956, Chinese films have been shown in Egypt and Syria, and have been warmly welcomed and praised by the people of Egypt and Syria.

The film "Chicken Feather Letter" was first released in Cairo when the Egyptian people were heroically resisting the Anglo-French aggressors. When the scene of the Japanese invaders being defeated and fleeing appeared on the screen, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically for several minutes. They also went to congratulate the Chinese ambassador who was present, shouting slogans such as "Long live Sino-Egyptian friendship" and "Long live peace." In the first two days of its screening at the Om Film Theater, the film attracted more than 4,500 viewers, surpassing the box office performance of the most popular American and Italian films. Egyptian newspapers also published extensive reviews, warmly congratulating the film.

In 1957, according to the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Agreement, China and Egypt held film weeks, which marked the entry of film art exchange between the two countries into a broader and deeper stage. The Chinese Film Exhibition Week held in Cairo screened feature films such as "The New Year's Sacrifice," "Reconnaissance Across the River," and "Guerrillas on the Plain," as well as short films such as "On the Banks of the Nile," "Scenic Spots in Beijing," and "The Magic Brush." The film "The New Year's Sacrifice" deeply moved the audience. A member of parliament said after watching the film that it reminded him of the fate of many Egyptian farmers under the rule of the Farouk dynasty and under the oppression of imperialism. "Reconnaissance Across the River" and "Guerrillas on the Plain" were also warmly welcomed by the audience. When the Chinese People's Liberation Army or the August 1st Army flag appeared on the screen, the audience responded with warm applause. Nadim, a famous Egyptian film critic, also expressed his opinion that the theme of Chinese films is sincere and expresses the real life of the people. It is particularly worth mentioning that President Nasser personally attended the opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Week.

The Syrian people are no strangers to Chinese films. In September 1956, at the Damascus International Fair, the Chinese color puppet film "The Magic Brush" and the color landscape film "Guilin Landscape" won silver and bronze medals respectively at the film festival. On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day in 1957, the Chinese Embassy in Syria hosted Syrian government officials and social figures to watch films such as "The Glorious Fifth Anniversary" and "Taking Huashan Mountain by Strategy," which were generally well received. The Syrian Minister of Agriculture said excitedly after watching the film, "The price of freedom in China is very high!" The Director of the Cultural Department of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he admired the high level of Chinese films. The Syrian "Call Newspaper" also said in its review: "These are two great films that every Syrian should see."

Although Chinese films have not yet been released in Lebanon, the Lebanese film delegation that visited China expressed interest in importing Chinese films for screening in Lebanon after watching some Chinese films. This shows the enthusiasm of Lebanese filmmakers for distributing Chinese films.

Currently, three Egyptian film companies have purchased films such as "The New Year's Sacrifice," "Railway Guerrillas," "Hassan and Gamila," and "Reconnaissance Across the River." Syrian film distributors have purchased "Taking Huashan Mountain by Strategy," "Chicken Feather Letter," and "Plaza Sketches." Some of the purchased films include distribution rights for the entire Arab region, which indicates that through the efforts of friends in the Egyptian and Syrian film distribution circles, Chinese films may have the opportunity to meet the people of Sudan, Iraq, Jordan, and other regions.

    阿拉伯人民喜爱中国电影
    李唯和
    1956年以来，我国影片先后在埃及、叙利亚映出，受到埃、叙人民的热烈欢迎和赞美。
    影片“鸡毛信”是在埃及人民英勇抗击英法侵略者时在开罗首次公映的。当银幕上出现日寇被击溃逃窜的场面时，全场观众热烈鼓掌达数分钟之久，他们并且拥去向出席观看的中国大使祝贺，同时高呼“中埃友好万岁”、“和平万岁”等口号。影片在奥姆影院映出头两天观众即达四千五百多人次，卖座情况超过了最叫座的美国片和意大利片。埃及各报也广为评论，热烈称贺。
    1957年根据中埃文化协定，中埃双方举办了电影周，这标志着中埃两国的电影艺术的接触已进入了更为深广的阶段。在开罗举行的中国电影展览周映出了“祝福”、“渡江侦察记”、“平原游击队”等故事片和“尼罗河畔”、“北京名胜”、“神笔”等短片。影片“祝福”深深感动了观众。一位国会议员看后说，这部影片使他回忆起在法鲁克王朝统治下和在帝国主义压榨下的许多埃及农民的命运。“渡江侦察记”、“平原游击队”等也受到观众热烈欢迎。当银幕上出现中国人民解放军或八一军旗时，观众就报以热烈的掌声。埃及著名电影评论家纳迪姆并发表意见说，中国电影的主题是真率的，它表现了人民的真实生活。特别值得提到的是纳赛尔总统亲自出席了中国电影周的开幕式。
    叙利亚人民对于中国影片也不陌生。1956年9月份在大马士革国际博览会期间举行的电影联欢节上，我国的彩色木偶片“神笔”和彩色风景片“桂林山水”就分别获得了银质和铜质奖章。1957年“八一”建军节前夕，我驻叙使馆曾招待叙政府官员和社会知名人士观看了“光辉的五周年”、“智取华山”等影片，普遍反映良好。叙农业部长观后很兴奋地说：“中国获得自由的代价是很高的啊！”叙外交部文化司司长表示他很佩服中国影片已有这样高的水平。叙“呼声报”在评论中也说：“这是两部伟大的影片，每个叙利亚人民都应该看一看。”
    中国影片在黎巴嫩虽然还未公映过，但是到过中国的黎巴嫩电影代表团，看了一些中国影片后，表示有兴趣输入中国影片到黎巴嫩去放映。这显示了黎巴嫩电影工作者对于发行中国影片的热心。
    现在埃及的三家电影公司已经购买了“祝福”、“铁道游击队”、“哈森与加米拉”、“渡江侦察记”等影片。叙利亚的电影发行人已经购买了“智取华山”、“鸡毛信”和“广场杂记”。购买的影片中有些是包括全阿拉伯地区的发行权的，这种情况表明：通过埃、叙电影发行界的朋友们的努力，中国影片将有可能和苏丹、伊拉克、约旦等地区的人民相见。
