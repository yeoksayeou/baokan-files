Xinhua News Agency, January 16th dispatch from Bonn: West German newspapers report that the West German Ministry of Defense has formulated a wide-ranging military expansion plan. The plan stipulates the acceleration of the construction of barracks, infantry and artillery training grounds, airfields, and tank training grounds.

　According to this plan, West Germany will build 160 new barracks in the next three years. The barracks will be surrounded by training fields, shooting ranges, and target ranges. These will require the occupation of large tracts of land.

    Newspapers report that the West German Ministry of Defense is also selecting locations for establishing missile bases.
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 16th dispatch: Bonn dispatch: West German Chancellor Adenauer delivered a lengthy radio address on the 15th. Adenauer adopted a very cold attitude towards the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a summit meeting. He said that the proposal to convene a meeting should be subject to the following reservations: "The number of participants should not be too large, and it should only be held when there is a definite possibility of reaching an understanding through the most cautious diplomatic preparations."

    Adenauer opposed the Soviet government's proposals for resolving the German question. He said, "We can never agree to such proposals." He also spoke in negative terms about the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He said: "The creation of this zone would mean the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the end of freedom in Western Europe, and the end of our own freedom."

    西德拟定扩军行动纲领
    阿登纳竟拒绝欧洲无原子区建议
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社波恩讯：西德报纸报道，西德国防部已经拟定了广泛的扩军计划。计划规定要加速建造兵营、步兵和炮兵的练兵场、飞机场以及坦克部队训练场。
  　根据这个计划，西德在最近三年内要建造一百六十座新兵营。兵营的四周将建筑教练场、射击场和打靶场。这些都需要占用大片的土地。
    报纸报道，西德国防部还在选择建立火箭基地的地方。
  据新华社柏林16日电　波恩消息：西德总理阿登纳15日发表了长篇广播演说。阿登纳对苏联关于举行最高级会议的建议采取非常冷淡的态度。他说，应该对召开会议的建议作以下的保留：“参加者的数目不能过多，而且只有在通过外交上最谨慎的准备工作而肯定有取得谅解的可能时才能举行。”
    阿登纳反对苏联政府关于解决德国问题的建议。他说，“我们永远也不能同意这样的建议。”他还用否定的口气谈到关于在欧洲中部建立无原子武器区的建议。他说：“这个地带的产生将意味着北大西洋公约组织的终结，也将意味着西欧自由的终结以及我们自己的自由的终结。”
