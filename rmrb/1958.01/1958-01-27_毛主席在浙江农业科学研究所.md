Chairman Mao at the Zhejiang Agricultural Science Research Institute
Zhejiang Daily Reporter Lü Shaoyu

    Early in January, on a Sunday. The winter sun was particularly warm that day, and the nearly one thousand mu of experimental fields at the Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute outside Hangzhou seemed so peaceful. Many staff members of the institute had gone to the city, and no one expected it to be an unusual Sunday.

    After lunch, Director Lou Yuguang entered his office. He had been sitting down for only a short while when he suddenly saw two cars appearing on the highway extending from downtown Hangzhou through the window. The cars got closer and closer, driving into the institute. Lou Yuguang hurriedly ran downstairs. The cars had already stopped in the open space between the two experimental buildings. The doors opened, and a responsible comrade with a robust figure and wearing a silver-gray overcoat stepped out. Ah! Chairman Mao is here? Lou Yuguang could hardly believe his eyes. He took a closer look, and it was indeed Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's face was rosy, his hair was black, and he was energetic, not like an old man over half a century old. Seeing Chairman Mao in such good health was truly gratifying. At this moment, Lou Yuguang realized that he had been standing in front of the door for too long. What was he doing here? He should quickly greet our most beloved Chairman Mao! He rushed to Chairman Mao in three steps. Chairman Mao extended his hand and shook Lou Yuguang's hand. Lou Yuguang felt a warm current flowing through his entire body.

    While shaking hands with Lou Yuguang, Chairman Mao asked him his name, where he was from, and how old he was. The kind questions were like a mother meeting her children after a long separation.

    Lou Yuguang was originally a little restrained and uneasy, and he couldn't speak. Upon contact with Chairman Mao, he immediately calmed down, feeling warm in his heart and wanting to pour out his feelings to the leader. He led Chairman Mao into the experimental building. In the corridor of the experimental building, there was a light green double-wheeled double-shared plow. Seeing this mechanical farm tool, Chairman Mao bent down, touched it, and asked Lou Yuguang:
    "Is this your improved double-wheeled double-shared plow?"
    Lou Yuguang said, "Yes, it is."
    Chairman Mao asked again, "Have the improved plow arms been installed?"

    After Lou Yuguang answered Chairman Mao's questions, he thought: Chairman Mao is so busy with state affairs every day, yet he even knows about the improvement of double-wheeled double-shared plows in our Zhejiang agricultural sector. Lou Yuguang also recalled that more than half a month ago, Premier Zhou had also come to the institute to inspect the use and promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows. How much Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou value the work of improving agricultural tools!

    After viewing the double-wheeled double-shared plow, Lou Yuguang led Chairman Mao into the lounge. Chairman Mao took off his hat and kindly asked Lou Yuguang to sit down together and talk about the institute's situation. This institute mainly focuses on researching how to increase the yield per unit area of rice, and also does some research on high-yield miscellaneous grains and cash crops. The institute is divided into four departments: agronomy, soil and fertilizer, plant protection, and animal husbandry, as well as a horticulture group. ...

    While Lou Yuguang introduced the situation, Chairman Mao gazed at Lou Yuguang with a kind look, showing great interest in every research work Lou Yuguang mentioned. It wasn't just interest; Chairman Mao was familiar with many research projects. Lou Yuguang spoke too quickly and initially forgot to introduce the research work on oil crops. Chairman Mao immediately interjected:
    "Do you also research oil crops such as peanuts, sesame, and oil tea?"
    Lou Yuguang made a supplement. Chairman Mao asked again:
    "Have you carried out research work on agricultural tools?"
    Lou Yuguang replied, "We have only done some in conjunction with other work."
    Chairman Mao continued, "To do research work, would it be good for you to establish a special department to carry out agricultural tool research work?" Lou Yuguang replied, "Good." Chairman Mao smiled and asked a provincial party committee leader next to him, "He (referring to Lou Yuguang) has agreed. Do you agree?" The responsible comrade replied, "Agree." Chairman Mao said, "That's good, then you should make a suggestion to the provincial party committee!"

    Chairman Mao then asked Lou Yuguang:
    "What did you study?"
    "I studied soil agrochemistry."

    Chairman Mao then said with great interest, "I would like to know, which element has the largest proportion in the elements contained in crops?"

    After Chairman Mao and Lou Yuguang discussed the proportions of various elements contained in crops, they also talked about the aggregate structure of the soil, as well as the relationship between sunlight, water, and crops. Finally, Chairman Mao asked Lou Yuguang to borrow a book on soil to read. Seeing Chairman Mao's spirit of eagerness to learn, Lou Yuguang didn't know what to say, so he immediately went to fetch the book.

    At this time, Chairman Mao left the lounge and walked to the experimental field in front of the building, stopping on a small path and looking around. This area used to be farmland. The two experimental buildings used for agricultural scientific research, as well as the glass greenhouses and staff dormitories used for experiments near the experimental buildings, were all built half a year ago. They indicate that Zhejiang's agricultural scientific research work has made new progress.

    To the east of the experimental field, a group of people were busy preparing to plow the land with a double-wheeled double-shared plow. It turned out that some of the workers and technicians in the institute had seen Chairman Mao come, so they specially ran to the experimental field to prepare a demonstration of plowing the field with a double-wheeled double-shared plow for Chairman Mao to see. Although worker Zhang Yougen had learned to use the double-wheeled double-shared plow a long time ago, today he was still carefully adjusting the adjusting rod repeatedly, fearing that something might go wrong; he was also softly urging the two yoked oxen in front, fearing that they would not be well-behaved. Someone next to him whispered, "Look! Chairman Mao is coming over." Then, Chairman Mao had already walked up to them and asked Zhang Yougen kindly:

    "Can you plow the land?"
    "I can plow the land."
    "Good! Then you plow."

    Zhang Yougen tugged on the ox rope, and the two oxen pulled the double-wheeled double-shared plow straight forward. At this time, Chairman Mao closely followed behind Zhang Yougen, attentively observing the dark gray soil turned over by the double-wheeled double-shared plow.

    Following the plowing to the edge of the field, Chairman Mao looked at Zhang Yougen and Lou Yuguang, who had just run over, with thoughtful eyes, and asked:
    "Is it less strenuous to use a double-wheeled double-shared plow than to use an old-fashioned wooden plow?"
    "It's less strenuous. It's also easier to operate than the old-fashioned wooden plow."
    "Can I do it?" Chairman Mao turned his face and asked everyone. People were amused by this humble question. Workers Zhang Yougen and Lü Qiqian knew that our most beloved Chairman Mao wanted to use the double-wheeled double-shared plow to plow the field himself, so they immediately turned the double-wheeled double-shared plow around and reinserted the plow into the soil.

    Chairman Mao turned to Lou Yuguang, who was standing next to him, and asked with concern, "Can you do it?"
    Lou Yuguang didn't say anything, and his face flushed. He had never plowed the land.

    At this time, Chairman Mao approached the double-wheeled double-shared plow and used this new type of agricultural tool to plow the field. The people around, especially Lou Yuguang, watched the furrows plowed by Chairman Mao, feeling that this was the happiest and most inspiring moment.

    After Chairman Mao followed the plow to the end of the field, he accepted the books presented by Deputy Director Li of the Provincial Farm Agricultural Machinery Administration and Lou Yuguang, and also inquired about the living conditions of the staff with concern. Before leaving, Chairman Mao once again warmly shook hands with the staff. Zhang Yougen and Lü Qiqian's hands were a little dirty from labor, and they were wondering where to wipe them. But it was too late. Chairman Mao reached out and shook their hands.

    The two cars started. Chairman Mao had left. This is how the staff of the Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute spent an unusual Sunday.

    It was late at night, and whose window was still shining with light? Ah! It was young technician Zhang Yanyu. He was writing in his diary. This young man had once wanted to go to college, feeling that there was no future in his agricultural work position. Today, he saw Chairman Mao attaching so much importance to agricultural work, actually plowing the field himself, and this was something he had never even thought of before! Zhang Yanyu wrote in his diary, "I was so wrong to be uneasy about my work. I am determined to devote all my energy to the cause of agricultural construction in the motherland." What was Lou Yuguang thinking? He said he didn't sleep well all night. He said that in his brief contact with Chairman Mao, he had further recognized his weaknesses. Before six o'clock in the morning on January 6, Lou Yuguang came to the office and seriously revised the 1958 agricultural scientific research work plan again. ...

    毛主席在浙江农业科学研究所
    浙江日报记者　吕韶羽
    1月初旬的一个星期天。这天，冬日的阳光格外和煦，杭州市郊外省农业科学研究所的近千亩试验田上显得那么宁静。所内许多工作人员都到市里去了，谁也没有料想到这是一个不平常的星期天。
    吃过午饭，所长楼宇光走进办公室。他坐下来不多会儿，忽然从窗口里看见那条从杭州市区伸延出来的公路上出现了两辆小汽车。小汽车越来越近，驶进了所内。楼宇光赶忙跑下楼，小汽车已经停在两幢试验大楼中间的空地上，车门敞开，有一位身材魁梧，身着银灰色的大衣的负责同志走出来。啊！毛主席来了？楼宇光简直不相信自己的眼睛，他再定神一看，果真是毛主席。毛主席脸色红润，头发乌黑，精神矍铄，不像是年过半百的老人。看到毛主席有这样好的身体，真教人快慰。这时，楼宇光发觉自己呆在门前的时间太长了，停在这里做什么，快去迎接我们最敬爱的毛主席！他三步并作两步跑到毛主席面前。毛主席伸过手来握住楼宇光的手。楼宇光感到一股暖流通遍全身。
    毛主席一面和楼宇光握着手，一面问他叫什么名字，是哪里人，有多大年纪。那亲切的问话，就像是母亲遇见了久别的儿女。
    楼宇光本来有些拘束、不安，话也说不出来。一和毛主席接触，他马上不慌乱了，只觉得心里热呼呼的，有一肚子话想向领袖倾吐。他领着毛主席走进试验大楼。在试验大楼的走廊里，放着一部淡绿色的双轮双铧犁。毛主席看到这部机械农具，弯下腰摸了摸，问楼宇光：
    “这是不是你们改进的双轮双铧犁？”
    楼宇光说：“是的。”
    毛主席又问：“改进的犁臂是不是已经装上了？”
    楼宇光回答了毛主席的问话后，心里想：毛主席他老人家每天忙于处理国家大事，真想不到竟连我们浙江农业部门改进双轮双铧犁的事情都知道。楼宇光又想起，在半个多月以前，周总理也曾到所里检查双轮双铧犁的使用和推广的情形。毛主席和周总理对农具的改进工作多么重视呀！
    参观完这部双轮双铧犁，楼宇光引毛主席走进休息室。毛主席脱下帽子，和蔼地要楼宇光一同坐下来谈谈所里的情况。这个研究所主要是研究提高水稻的单位面积产量，同时也作一些高产杂粮和经济作物的研究工作。所内共分农艺、土壤肥料、植物保护、畜牧等四个系和一个园艺组。……
    在楼宇光介绍情况时，毛主席用慈祥的目光注视着楼宇光，对楼宇光说的每一件研究工作，都很有兴趣。不止是有兴趣，毛主席对许多研究工作都很熟悉。楼宇光说话过快，开始忘记介绍油料作物的研究工作，毛主席马上插问：
    “还有花生、芝麻、油茶等油料作物你们是否研究？”
    楼宇光作了补充。毛主席又问：
    “你们有没有进行农具方面的研究工作？”
    楼宇光答道：“我们只结合做了一些。”
    毛主席接着说：“要作研究工作，你们设立一个专门部门来进行农具研究工作好不好？”楼宇光回答说“好的”，毛主席笑着又问旁边的一位省委负责同志说：“他（指楼宇光）是同意了，你赞成不赞成？”那位负责同志回答：“赞成。”毛主席说：“那好，你们就向省委提个建议吧！”
    毛主席又问楼宇光：
    “你是学什么的？”
    “我学的是土壤农化。”
    毛主席接着兴致勃勃地说：“我想了解一下，农作物所包含的元素以什么元素的比重最大？”
    毛主席和楼宇光谈了农作物所含各种元素的比重后，还谈到了土壤的团粒结构以及日光、水分与农作物的关系。末了，毛主席向楼宇光借一本关于土壤方面的书籍看看。楼宇光见到毛主席这种好学的精神，一时不知说什么才好，便立刻取书去了。
    这时，毛主席离开休息室，走到大楼前面的试验地，在一条小道上停下来，环顾四周。这一带地方，原是一片农田。那两幢供作农业科学研究工作之用的试验大楼，和在试验大楼附近作试验用的玻璃温室、职工宿舍，都是在半年前盖起来的。它们表明浙江农业科学研究工作有了新的发展。
    在试验地的东边，有一群人正忙着准备用双轮双铧犁耕地。原来，所里的一部分工人和技术人员看到毛主席来了，就特地跑到试验地上，准备作一次使用双轮双铧犁耕田的表演给毛主席看。工人张有根虽然很早就学会使用双轮双铧犁，可是今天他仍然反复用心地调整着调节杆，唯恐出了什么差错；又?喝着前面两只摇头摆尾的耕牛，唯恐它们不老实。旁边有人轻声地告诉他：“你看！毛主席走过来啦。”接着，毛主席已经走到跟前，和气地问张有根：
    “你会耕地吗？”
    “我会耕地。”
    “好哇！你就耕吧。”
    张有根牵动一下牛绳，两头耕牛拉着双轮双铧犁笔直地前行。毛主席这时紧紧跟在张有根的后面，聚精会神地观察双轮双铧犁翻过的深灰色的土壤。
    跟着犁耕到地边，毛主席用深思的眼光望着张有根和刚刚跑过来的楼宇光，问道：
    “用双轮双铧犁比用旧式木犁省力吧？”
    “省力。比起旧式木犁来，还容易操纵。”
    “我行吗？”毛主席把脸转过来问大家。人们被这谦逊的问话引笑了。工人张有根、吕其千知道我们最敬爱的毛主席要亲自使用双轮双铧犁耕田，立刻调过双轮双铧犁的头，把犁重新插入土壤。
    毛主席对着站在旁边的楼宇光，关心地问：“你行吗？”
    楼宇光没有说出什么，唰地一下脸红了。他没有耕过地。
    这时，毛主席走近双轮双铧犁，用这部新式农具犁田。周围的人，特别是楼宇光，注视着毛主席犁过的田沟，感到这是最幸福、也是受启发最深刻的时刻。
    毛主席随犁耕到地头后，接受了省农场农具管理局李副局长和楼宇光赠送的书籍，又关怀地询问了职工们的生活情况。在临走的时候，毛主席又一次热情地同职工们握手。张有根和吕其千的手，因为劳动有些脏，他们正在为难不知往哪儿擦一擦。可是来不及了。毛主席向前握住了他们的手。
    两辆小汽车开动了。毛主席他老人家走了。省农业科学研究所的职工们就是这样度过了一个不平凡的星期天。
    夜深了，那是谁的窗户还闪耀着灯光？啊！是青年技术员张燕誉。他在写日记。这个小伙子曾经要求去考大学，嫌在农业工作岗位上没有什么奔头。今天，他看到毛主席这样重视农业工作，竟亲自扶犁耕田，而这件事，他过去连想也没有想到呀！张燕誉在日记本上写道：“我不安心工作太错了。我决心把自己的全副精力用在祖国的农业建设事业上。”楼宇光呢？他在想些什么呢？他说他一夜也没睡好。他说他在同毛主席短暂的接触中，更认清了自己的弱点。1月6日早晨不到六点钟，楼宇光就来到了办公室，重新认真地修改1958年的农业科学研究工作规划。……
