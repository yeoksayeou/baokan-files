    Relying on the Masses to Build Hospitals Through Thrift
    ——The Growth of An'yi People's Hospital in Shanxi
    Shan Wei
    Since its establishment in 1947, An'yi People's Hospital in Shanxi Province has consistently maintained and promoted the fine traditions of hospitals in revolutionary base areas of "managing affairs diligently and thriftily, and studying assiduously." It has actively improved the skills of existing health technical personnel and cultivated new forces for the people's medical cause. Moreover, it has used its own experience and example to guide and drive the medical and health institutions of seventeen counties in the entire district, initially forming a new type of rural health business technical guidance network. In just a few years, it has transformed a region with very backward medical technology into an advanced region.
    A few years ago, the medical and healthcare technology in the Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi was quite backward. There was not a single public health institution in the entire district capable of performing abdominal surgery. An'yi People's Hospital also had only thirty beds and just over ten medical staff. The doctors' skills were very low; internists couldn't use a sphygmomanometer, and surgeons couldn't treat hemorrhoids. But the situation is very different now. An'yi Hospital has become a fairly large rural central hospital. The hospital has two hundred beds, more than 150 medical and technical personnel, and is equipped with X-ray machines and various modern medical science equipment for medical examinations and tests. It can independently solve difficult and complicated diseases and handle major surgeries. According to incomplete statistics, since 1955 alone, the hospital has performed 3,247 various surgeries, including 969 abdominal surgeries. Many diseases that could not be cured in the past can now be cured, and many chronic diseases that were previously difficult to cure can now be cured quickly. Under the technical guidance of An'yi People's Hospital, the technical level of health centers, hospitals, and nearby industrial and mining medical health care institutions in seventeen counties of the district has improved significantly. At present, health centers and hospitals in various counties have established laboratories and operating rooms. Some counties have also established new therapy rooms, which can solve general difficult and complicated diseases locally and perform relatively complex surgical and abdominal operations. To facilitate the work in various places, the hospital has also created simple decompression, oxygen transfusion, blood testing equipment and supplies. This has not only allowed thousands of patients to receive treatment nearby but has also greatly reduced the medical expenses burden on the masses, basically achieving the goals of minimizing travel, spending less money, receiving early treatment, and recovering quickly, thereby protecting the health of farmers and supporting agricultural production.
    The funds required by An'yi People's Hospital in guiding and improving rural medical and health care undertakings are mostly solved through self-reliance. For example, from 1947 to 1951, the hospital's total income was more than 105,000 yuan, and the state subsidized more than 48,000 yuan. But from 1952 to 1957, the hospital's total income reached more than 1.38 million yuan, and the state only subsidized more than 360,000 yuan, a 19.7% reduction in the need for state assistance compared to the previous stage.
    The problem of health cadres is also basically solved by relying on the hospital itself. In the ten years from 1947 to 1957, the higher authorities only allocated twelve health technical cadres to the hospital. However, in recent years, the hospital has trained and improved more than 1,700 various health technical cadres through various means. These personnel include twenty-four senior medical personnel above the level of physician, and are currently distributed in counties, districts, townships, and towns throughout the district, becoming the main technical force for eliminating serious diseases.
    Under the leadership of the Party, how did the entire staff of An'yi People's Hospital overcome difficulties, rely on their own efforts, and transform backwardness into advancement?
    The predecessor of An'yi People's Hospital, Yuncheng Hospital, was established in Xia County in 1947. At that time, it was in a wartime environment, and material conditions were very difficult. The beds were only door panels and earthen beds, patients could only lie down on the spot, there was no medicine or equipment, the entire hospital only had one knife pack and a few stethoscopes, and business income was not enough to maintain life. But they did not succumb to difficulties. While engaging in salt transportation, medicine sales and other sideline production, they actively treated diseases for the masses.

          Relying on the Masses and Building the Hospital Through Thrift 　 At that time, the entire hospital was desolate, a pile of rubble. In order to build wards and clear the roads, all the staff spent 2,470 workdays, built sixty yards of walls, and paved four roads. They turned the rubble pile into a ward courtyard and the dirty pit into a basketball court. They also built artificial hills, greened the environment, and planted more than 5,000 trees. In order to make up for the shortage of building materials, they also dug more than 110,000 bricks from the abandoned city walls, saving more than 1,650 yuan. In addition, they repaired 127 pieces of tables, chairs and utensils, and the old gas lamps and loudspeakers were also repaired and utilized, transforming a dilapidated old site into a very comfortable sanatorium.
    Having a hospital but lacking doctors, the Party branch made a special study of this issue and organized rural doctors in accordance with the principle of "absorbing, training, and transforming simultaneously." President Cheng Zhenshan personally took the lead, visiting famous doctors everywhere, and absorbed a total of nineteen doctors over the years. At the same time, more than 100 nursing staff were trained through self-funded study. The number of hospital beds also gradually increased, from thirty in 1947 to sixty in 1951.
    Having doctors but no equipment, having equipment but no electricity, this series of problems was also solved by relying on the hard work of all the staff. For example, an operating lamp was needed for surgery, but shadowless lamps were too expensive to buy, so two washbasins were put together to make an operating spotlight. Under the illumination of this lamp, more than 3,000 patients have safely undergone various operations in recent years. In addition, simple gastrointestinal decompression devices and oxygen transfuers, as well as methods for manufacturing oxygen, were created, which not only ensured the quality of medical care but also saved funds. In recent years, surgeon Wei Biqing alone has created and repaired more than twenty kinds of physiotherapy equipment. In order to solve the problems of electricity and lighting, doctors and workers cooperated to renovate and repair the waste generators and internal combustion engines that had been stockpiled for many years, basically guaranteeing the hospital's electricity supply, saving more than 40,000 yuan in this single item.
    The spirit of "thrift in managing the family and labor in building the hospital" is implemented in all aspects of the hospital's work. For example, in terms of general affairs, rational use of houses, turning toilets into dormitories, and turning dormitories into wards increased the number of inpatients by more than fifty, which could save more than 57,000 yuan in basic construction costs. Turning the gatehouse into a classroom, living on both sides and teaching in the middle, solved the accommodation and teaching problems of forty people. In terms of material supply, more than 216,000 catties of coal were saved in 1955 and 1956 alone. At the same time, cloth was saved, the method of using bedding was improved, and the "life" of bedding was extended. In recent years, a total of forty-two pieces of white cloth were saved.
    The doctors of An'yi People's Hospital all came from the countryside. Although they were diligent and simple, they also had many confused ideas, such as being more free and undisciplined, selfish and conservative due to their long-term decentralized practice in the past. In response to these characteristics, in recent years, the hospital, in accordance with the principle of both uniting and transforming, has taken care of them in many aspects of life, making them feel warm and have feelings for the people's cause, and happily accept education and transformation. At the same time, through regular political theory study, they gradually clarified the bright prospects of socialism, the relationship between the individual and the country, and eliminated confused ideas such as "the country has a future, but the individual has no future."
    All the Party members of the hospital regard uniting and transforming technical personnel as a political task, actively care about their ideological situation, and lead them forward with their own exemplary actions. The Party branch often studies the ideological changes of the doctors, and uses summaries, weekly reports, evaluations and other methods to commend and criticize typical figures, establish model banners, and clarify the direction of efforts. The advanced workers movement has also been widely and deeply carried out, and model workers are evaluated once a year, with a total of fifty-seven advanced workers and twenty-five models selected, and more than eighty people promoted, including twenty-four senior medical personnel and fifty-seven intermediate medical personnel. As a result of the above series of work, the political and ideological situation of the medical staff has undergone fundamental changes. Originally, progressive senior medical personnel accounted for 27%, and intermediate personnel accounted for 65%. Now, progressive medical personnel account for 65%, and intermediate personnel account for 30%. At the beginning of the establishment of the hospital, there were only two Party members in the entire hospital. Now it has developed to thirty-two Party members and sixty-five League members, accounting for 64.2% of the total number of medical personnel.

        Overcoming Difficulties and Training Technical Cadres
    In order to overcome the difficulties of medical technology, An'yi People's Hospital adopted the technical cooperation method of advanced driving backward, which generally improved the technical level of medical staff. First of all, in all departments of the hospital, the method of "contracting responsibility, driving at all levels" was adopted to train technical cadres. Old doctors lead new doctors, doctors lead medical assistants, head nurses lead nurses, nurses lead nursing staff, advanced departments lead backward departments, and so on, achieving remarkable results. For example, Director Li Jinxin of the Department of Surgery alone took five apprentices, so that Wang Renkuan, a primary school student who joined the work in 1949, also mastered the basic knowledge of surgery and could handle general surgery. At the same time, the combination of medical care and teaching further improved the technical level of senior medical personnel and strengthened the differential diagnosis of diseases. In the past, doctors relied only on general concepts for the diagnosis of diseases, lacking etiological analysis and classification research, so sometimes misdiagnosis occurred. Now, twenty-four kinds of diagnosis and treatment nursing routines have been determined in internal medicine. In the past, typhoid fever could not be diagnosed for a month, but now it can be diagnosed in a week.
    In order to improve the quality of medical care, An'yi People's Hospital attached great importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promoted new therapies, fundamentally reversing the "old-fashioned" methods of some doctors who stick to conventions and treat headaches for headaches and foot pain for foot pain, and further encouraged the atmosphere of scientific research.
    In recent years, An'yi People's Hospital has also sent twenty-six doctors to major hospitals in the province and city for further study to train professional technical backbones. For example, Han Wenbin went to Shanxi University to study and carried out forty kinds of ophthalmic surgery, with 100 cases of cataract excision alone, with a curative effect of 99%. Li Xun went to the Provincial Hospital to study and carried out thirty kinds of kidney and spleen resection, gastrointestinal anastomosis and other operations. In addition, thirty-seven intermediate medical personnel were selected and sent to various health schools for study.

        Facing the Countryside and Serving Production
    In order to further solve the problem of rural medical and health care, with the specific help of the Jinnan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, An'yi People's Hospital has vigorously strengthened the technical guidance of rural medical and health institutions since 1954, and initially established a technical guidance network with a three-level linked guidance center at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels. The activity modes of this technical guidance network include eight types: centralized further study, professional training, technical decentralization, clinical practice, on-site guidance, technical appraisal, linked training, and driving backward. Through these activities, the health business technology of seventeen counties in the district is unified into a whole, maintaining regular and close technical business contacts, learning from each other, and improving together. This technical guidance network has not only trained more than 1,700 excellent technical personnel for the country but also greatly improved the technical quality of medical and health care work in various counties.
    An'yi People's Hospital has always been concerned about the suffering of the masses and maintains close contact with the masses. For example, in order to cooperate with the high tide of agricultural cooperation and prevent the spread of various infectious diseases, An'yi People's Hospital regularly and irregularly organizes medical forces to go deep into the countryside to specifically help county health centers in mountainous and old areas with weak foundations, solve difficult and complicated diseases and improve technology. The health centers visited by the medical teams have all received strong assistance. For example, when the medical team arrived in Yuanqu, the hospital had only six beds and no operating room. The medical team helped them establish an operating room, which greatly developed the business. The masses reflected that An'yi People's Hospital is not only a hospital that rescues the dying and heals the wounded but also a good school for training cadres.
    The medical staff of An'yi People's Hospital not only actively relieve the suffering of the masses but also care about production and participate in production. Every year during the wheat harvesting season, medical staff help the masses harvest wheat. They are also not behind in the labor of building dikes and preventing floods. In 1957, in order to fight drought and survive the famine, all the staff of the hospital worked together to collect more than 17,000 catties of wild vegetables, an average of about 80 catties per person. This close contact with the masses, sharing weal and woe with the masses, serving production, and providing a good example for the work of rural hospitals.

    依靠群众勤俭办医院
    ——记山西安邑人民医院的成长
    山卫
    山西省安邑人民医院自从1947年建院以来，一贯保持和发扬了革命根据地医院“勤俭办事，刻苦钻研”的优良传统，积极地提高现有卫生技术人员和为人民的医疗事业培养新生力量，并且以自己的经验和榜样，指导和带动了全区十七个县的医疗卫生机构，初步形成了一个新型的乡村卫生业务技术指导网。在短短的几年中，它就带动原来是医药技术十分落后的地区成为先进的地区了。
  　几年前，晋南运城地区的医疗保健技术是相当落后的，全区没有一个能够做腹部手术的公立卫生机构。安邑人民医院也只有病床三十张，医务人员十余人。医生的技术很低，内科医生不会用血压计，外科医生治不了痔疮。但是现在的情况就大不相同了，安邑医院已成为一个具有相当规模的乡村中心医院。全院有病床二百张，医务技术人员一百五十余人，并且设有X光机和各种医疗、化验等现代医学科学设备，可以单独解决疑难病症和处理重大手术。据不完全统计，仅1955年以来，该院就作了各种手术三千二百四十七次，其中腹部手术九百六十九次。过去许多不能治的病现在都能治了，过去许多久治不愈的病，现在也能迅速治好了。在安邑人民医院的技术指导下，全区十七个县的卫生院、医院以及附近工矿医疗卫生保健机构的技术水平有了显著提高。目前，各县卫生院，医院都建立了化验室、手术室，一部分县还建立了新疗法室，都能就地解决一般性疑难病症和做比较复杂的外科手术及腹部手术。为了便利各地开展工作，该院还创造了简易的减压、输氧、验血等器具和用品，这样不仅使成千上万的患者可以就近治疗，而且也大量减少了群众的医药费负担，基本上作到了少跑路，少花钱，早治病，早痊愈，保护了农民健康和支援了农业生产。
    安邑人民医院在指导和提高农村医疗保健事业的过程中，所需要的经费大部分是自力更生解决的。例如：1947年至1951年该院总收入十万五千余元，国家补助了四万八千余元。但1952年至1957年该院总收入就达一百三十八万余元，国家只补助三十六万余元，比前一个阶段需要国家帮助费用减少了19.7％。
    卫生干部问题，也基本上是靠自己解决的。在1947年至1957年的十年间，上级仅给该院分配了卫生技术干部十二人，而该院几年来通过各种方式就培养和提高了各种卫生技术干部一千七百余人，这些人员中包括医师以上的高级医务人员二十四人，目前分布全区各县、区、乡、镇，成为消灭危害严重疾病的主要技术力量。
    安邑人民医院的全体工作人员在党的领导下，是如何克服困难，自力更生，变落后为先进的呢？
    安邑人民医院的前身运城医院，是1947年在夏县成立的。当时处于战争环境，物质条件十分困难，病床只是门板、土炕，病人只能就地而卧，无医药，无器械，全院只有刀包一个和听诊器几具，业务收入不足维持生活。但是他们并没有为困难屈服，一边搞运盐、售药等副业生产，一边积极地为群众救治疾病。
          依靠群众，勤俭办院 　 当时，全院满目荒凉，一片瓦砾。为了修建病房，通畅道路，全体工作人员花费了二千四百七十个劳动日，打墙六十丈，铺平马路四条。把瓦碴堆变为病房场院，把脏土坑变为篮球场。并且修造假山，绿化环境，植树五千余株。为了弥补建筑材料的不足，还从废城墙挖砖十一万余块，节约了一千六百五十余元，此外还修补桌椅用具一百二十七件，破旧的汽灯、扩音器也都经整修利用起来，把一个破烂不堪的旧院址改造成为一个很舒适的疗养场所。
    有了医院还缺少医生，党支部对这一问题又专门作了研究，按照“边吸收，边培养，边改造”的方针，去组织在乡医生。院长程震山同志亲自出马，遍访名医，几年中共吸收了十九位医生。同时，采取自费学习的办法，训练了护理人员一百多名。医院的病床也逐渐增加，由1947年的三十张，到1951年增加到六十张。
    有了医生没有器械，有了器械没电力，这一系列的问题也是依靠全体工作人员的辛勤劳动去解决的。例如：作手术需要个灯，但无影灯买起来太贵，就用两个洗脸盆合在一起，做了个手术聚光灯。在这个灯的照耀下，几年来就有三千多病人，安全的进行了各种手术。此外，还创造了简易的胃肠减压器和输氧器，以及制造氧气的办法，不仅保证了医疗质量，而且节约了资金。几年来，仅外科医生卫毕卿就创造和整修了二十多种理疗器械。为了解决用电和照明的问题，医生和工人合作，将积压多年的废发电机、内燃机，加以改装修整，基本上保证了全院的用电，仅此一项就可节约四万余元。
    “勤俭治家，劳动建院”的精神贯彻在医院工作的一切方面。例如：在总务方面，合理使用房屋，把厕所变为宿舍，把宿舍变为病房，就增收了病员五十余人，可以节约基本建设费用五万七千余元。把门楼改成教室，两边住人，中间上课，解决了四十人的住宿教学问题。在物资供应方面，仅1955、1956两年就节约煤炭二十一万六千余斤。同时节用布匹，改进被服使用办法，延长被服“寿命”，几年来，共节约了白布四十二匹。
    安邑人民医院的医生都是从乡下来，虽然勤俭朴素但也有很多糊涂思想，如由于过去长期分散开业，比较自由散漫、自私保守等。针对这些特点，几年来该院根据既团结又改造的方针，对他们在生活上多方面照顾，使他们感到温暖，对人民事业发生了感情，愉快的接受教育改造。同时，通过经常性的政治理论学习，使他们逐步明确社会主义的美好远景，个人同国家的关系，消除了“国家有前途，个人没前途”等糊涂思想。
    该院全体党员把团结改造技术人员作为一项政治任务，主动的关怀他们的思想情况，以自己的模范行动带动他们前进。党支部经常研究医生们的思想变化情况，利用总结、周会报告、评比等方式，表扬批评典型人物，树立模范旗帜，明确努力方向。并且普遍、深入地开展了先进工作者运动，每年评模一次，共评选先进工作者五十七人，模范二十五人，提拔八十余人，其中高级医务人员二十四人，中级医务人员五十七人。由于以上一系列的工作，医务人员的政治思想情况已经起了根本变化，原来高级医务人员进步的占27％，中间的占65％。现在医务人员中进步的占65％，中间的占30％。在建院初期，全院仅有党员二人，现已发展到党员三十二人，团员六十五人，占医务人员总数的64.2％。
        克服困难，培养技术干部
    为了克服医疗技术的困难，安邑人民医院采取了先进带动落后的技术合作办法，普遍提高了医务人员的技术水平。首先，在全院各科室采取“包干负责、逐级带动”的办法培养技术干部。以老医生带新医生，以医师带医士，以护士长带护士，以护士带护理员，以先进科室带落后科室等，取得了显著效果。如外科李金鑫主任一人带了五个徒弟，使1949年参加工作的高小学生王仁宽，也掌握了外科基本知识和能处理一般手术。同时，通过医疗和教学结合也进一步提高了高级医务人员的技术水平，加强了疾病的鉴别诊断，过去医生对疾病的诊断只依靠一般概念，缺乏病因分析分类研究，因而有时误诊。现在确定了内科二十四种诊疗护理常规，过去伤寒病一个月不能确诊，现在一个星期即可确诊。
    为了提高医疗质量，安邑人民医院十分重视学习苏联的先进经验，推行了新疗法，从根本上扭转了有些医生墨守成规，头痛医头，足痛医足的“老一套”办法，进一步鼓励了科学研究风气。
    几年来，安邑人民医院还派出医生二十六人到省市各大医院进修，以培养专业技术骨干。如韩文斌到山大学习，开展了眼科手术四十种，仅割治白内障一百例，疗效达到99％。李询到省立医院学习，开展了肾脏脾脏截除，胃肠吻合及其他手术三十余种。另外还选派中级医务人员三十七人到各卫生学校学习。
        面向农村，为生产服务
    为了进一步解决乡村医疗保健问题，该院在晋南专署的具体帮助下，从1954年以来，大力加强对农村医疗卫生机构的技术指导工作，初步建立了一个省、专、县三级连环指导为中心的技术指导网。这个技术指导网的活动方式有集中进修、专业训练、技术下放、临床实习、上门指导、技术鉴定、连环培养、带动落后等八种。通过这些活动把全区十七个县的卫生业务技术统一为一个整体，保持经常密切的技术业务联系，互相学习，共同提高。这个技术指导网不仅为国家培养了一千七百多名优秀的技术人员，而且把各县的医疗保健工作的技术质量大大地提高了一步。
    安邑人民医院一贯的关心群众疾苦，密切联系群众。如为了配合农业合作化的高潮和防止各种传染病流行，安邑人民医院定期和不定期组织医疗力量深入农村，具体帮助基础薄弱的山区、老区县卫生院，解决疑难病症和提高技术。凡医疗队到过的卫生院，都得到有力的帮助。例如，医疗队到垣曲的时候，该院只有六张病床，没有手术室，医疗队就帮助他们建立了手术室，使业务有了很大的开展。群众反映说：安邑人民医院既是救死扶伤的医院，又是培养干部的好学校。
    安邑人民医院的医护人员，不仅积极为群众解除疾苦，而且关心生产、参加生产。每年割麦季节，医护人员就帮助群众割麦。在修堤防洪的劳动中，他们也不落后。1957年为了抗旱度荒，全院人员一齐动手采野菜一万七千余斤，平均每人八十斤左右。这种密切联系群众，和群众同甘共苦，为生产服务，为乡村医院工作提供了良好的榜样。
