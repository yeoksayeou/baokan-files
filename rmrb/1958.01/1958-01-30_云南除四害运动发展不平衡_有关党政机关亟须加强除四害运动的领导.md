　　This newspaper reports: The winter patriotic health campaign in Yunnan Province, centered on eliminating the four pests, is progressing very unevenly and urgently needs strengthened leadership.

　　Over the past few years, the patriotic health movement in Yunnan Province has achieved certain results. According to statistics from the provincial health department, in the past year alone, Kunming and nineteen other cities and counties eliminated more than 650,000 rats and more than 900,000 sparrows, and accumulated more than 43 million dan of fertilizer. Ten rat-free villages, such as Lefeng Township in Jianchuan, seven mosquito- and fly-free villages, such as Hongha Village in Xichou County, and one sparrow-free village have emerged. These types of villages are continuing to appear. However, for many years, apart from a few special districts, counties, and cities such as Wenshan, the work of eliminating the four pests in most parts of the province has been fluctuating. During the anti-bacterial warfare campaign in 1952, a spirited patriotic health campaign was carried out for a period of time, but afterwards, it was left to drift for a long time. When the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) was published in the spring of 1956, another climax of pest elimination was launched, but then there was a lack of regular activity. Even during the movements, the work of eliminating the four pests in most areas mostly remained in the county towns and one or two key areas, and had not yet extended to the vast rural areas.

　　At present, the winter patriotic health campaign in Yunnan can be roughly divided into three types: forty counties and cities, such as Xichou, Kunming, Wenshan, Chenggong, and Dali, are launching winter health campaign blitzes in conjunction with rural water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. In mid-month, more than 130,000 cadres, students, soldiers, and residents in Kunming City, under the leadership of the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, launched a concentrated attack on the four pests. Now, a climax in the city's winter patriotic health campaign has basically formed. However, most cities and counties in the province have not yet taken action. The plans of the health departments in dozens of cities and counties, such as Yuanjiang, are still in the offices and have not been transformed into mass action. Some counties believe that it is not good to carry out water conservancy construction and eliminate the four pests at the same time, delaying and procrastinating with insufficient enthusiasm. A few counties and cities, such as Kaiyuan, have not yet taken any action at all, with neither plans nor mobilization of the masses.

　　The climate in most areas of Yunnan is relatively mild, and the time for winter is running out. Seizing the opportunity to eliminate the hibernating four pests and maggots, pupae, eggs, and larvae is already imperative. To this end, the Yunnan Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has issued instructions to all special districts, cities, and counties in the province, requiring all localities to vigorously launch a mass-based winter health campaign to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and prevent diseases from now until the Spring Festival, in conjunction with water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. The provincial health department has formulated specific plans and is preparing to organize a tour group to visit Xichou County, the province's health model county, and send a working group to summarize experience and reorganize the Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee to strengthen leadership.

### 云南除四害运动发展不平衡  有关党政机关亟须加强除四害运动的领导

    云南除四害运动发展不平衡
    有关党政机关亟须加强除四害运动的领导
    本报讯　云南省以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动，进展很不平衡，亟需加强领导。
    几年以来，云南省爱国卫生运动获得了一定成绩，据省卫生部门统计：仅去年昆明等十九个市县共消灭老鼠六十五万多只，麻雀九十多万只，积肥四千三百多万担。出现了剑川乐凤乡等十个无鼠乡村，西畴县哄哈村等七个无蚊无蝇村和一个无麻雀村。目前这种乡村还在继续出现。但多年以来，除文山等少数专区、县市外，全省大部地区消灭四害的工作却处于几起几伏中间。1952年反对细菌战时，热火朝天地进行了一段时间的爱国卫生运动，以后即长期陷于自流；1956年春天全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布时，又掀起了除四害的高潮，随后就又缺乏经常的活动。即使在运动中，多数地区消灭四害的工作也大多停留在县城和一、二个重点上，尚未向广大农村伸展。
    现在，云南的冬季爱国卫生运动大体可以分成三种类型：西畴、昆明、文山、呈贡、大理等四十个县市，正结合农村水利积肥开展冬季卫生运动突击月。昆明市在本月中旬，已有十三万多干部、学生、战士和居民，在市委第一书记的率领下对四害进行了一次歼击，现在全市冬季爱国卫生运动高潮已基本形成。但全省多数市县至今还未行动起来，元江等几十个市县卫生部门的计划还放在机关里，没有变成群众的行动；有的县认为兴修水利和除四害不好同时进行，因循延误，干劲不足。开远等少数县市现在还根本没有动手，既无计划也没有发动群众。
    云南省大多数地区的气候比较温和，冬天的时间已经不多，抓紧时机消灭冬眠状态的四害和蛆、蛹、蛋、卵，已经刻不容缓。为此，云南省爱国卫生运动委员会已向全省各专区、市县发出指示，要求各地从即日起到春节前结合水利积肥，大力开展全民性的除四害、讲卫生、防疾病的冬季卫生运动。省卫生部门已制订出具体计划，准备再组织参观团去全省卫生模范县——西畴县参观，并派出工作组前往总结经验，重新组织省爱国卫生运动委员会，以加强领导。（新华社专稿）
