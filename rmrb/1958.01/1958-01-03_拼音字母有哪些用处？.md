    What are the Uses of Pinyin Letters?
    Lü Shuxiang
    The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme was announced by the State Council on the 11th of last month. Since February 1956, when the Chinese Language Reform Committee published the first draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, it has undergone extensive discussions among people from all walks of life across the country, repeated deliberations and multiple revisions by the State Council's Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee, before finally being approved and announced by the State Council, and a decision made to submit it to the next session of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. In these two years, people from all walks of life, whether participating in discussions or writing directly to the Chinese Language Reform Committee, have put forward many valuable opinions and different requirements for the pinyin scheme. These opinions and requirements have been carefully considered and met as much as possible in the process of revising and reviewing the pinyin scheme draft. On the other hand, since the publication of the first draft, a broad mass of people have expressed warm welcome and support, actively learning and experimenting with its application in various ways, and constantly inquiring about when it could be officially finalized. This proves that the masses' need and expectation for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme are very keen. The People's Daily editorial said: "Formulating and promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is an important task in the current language reform and a major event in the cultural life of our people." This statement is absolutely correct. However, there are still some people in society who, because they don't usually pay much attention to this issue, inevitably have doubts when they suddenly hear such a statement: "What are the uses of pinyin letters that make them worthy of such importance?" We intend to answer this question simply here. Before describing the various uses of pinyin letters, it must first be clarified: pinyin letters are not equal to pinyin writing. Whether Chinese characters should be reformed into pinyin writing needs further research and discussion and is not a problem to be solved at present. Pinyin letters, even if not used as a tool for pinyin writing, will play a huge role in China's cultural and educational undertakings.
    First, pinyin letters can be used to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Chinese characters have one characteristic: there is no direct and systematic connection between the shape of the character and its pronunciation. The vast majority of writing systems in the world are phonetic, which means that you can pronounce the sound of a character by looking at its shape (although some writing systems, such as English, have inconsistencies between spelling and pronunciation in some places due to historical reasons). Only Chinese characters are not like this. You cannot immediately pronounce the sound of a character by looking at its shape. You must be taught by someone or look it up in a dictionary. In the past, there were two methods for annotating pronunciation in dictionaries: one was fǎnqiè (a method of indicating the pronunciation of a Chinese character by using two other characters), and the other was zhíyīn (direct pronunciation). The fǎnqiè method was used the most. Not only old dictionaries like the Kangxi Dictionary, but also modern publications like the Ciyuan and Cihai, still mainly use the fǎnqiè method, supplemented by the zhíyīn method at times. Both of these annotation methods have shortcomings. The fǎnqiè method uses two Chinese characters quickly and continuously to make it one sound. When using this method to annotate pronunciation, the fǎnqiè characters selected must be easy to pronounce in succession, otherwise there will be difficulties. For example, "渠, 群余切" (cited from Cihai's phonetic annotation as an example, the same below), "群余" is not easy to pronounce in succession. (The fǎnqiè method originally had a rule, which is that the first character only takes its initial consonant, and the second character only takes its final vowel, but the average person using the dictionary does not necessarily understand this rule.) The zhíyīn method uses one character to annotate another character, avoiding the trouble of fǎnqiè. However, among homophones, some are common and some are rare. Using a common character to annotate a rare character is no problem; using a rare character to annotate a rare character cannot serve the purpose of annotating pronunciation. For example, "惕, 音逖" (tì, pronounced as tì), people who do not recognize the character "惕" probably do not recognize the character "逖" either, so this annotation is useless. The fǎnqiè and zhíyīn methods also have a common shortcoming: the pronunciation of Chinese characters changes over time and varies from place to place. Therefore, sometimes reading according to the fǎnqiè or zhíyīn in the dictionary can lead to mispronunciation. For example, "松, 徐容切" (sōng, pronounced as xú róng qiē), which sounds like "熊" (xióng); "兀, 吴滑切" (wù, pronounced as wú huá qiē), which sounds like "娃" (wá). Using fǎnqiè and zhíyīn simultaneously seems to give readers more convenience - if you can't achieve the purpose with this method, you can use that method - but sometimes it also creates confusion. For example, "灼, 职约切, 音酌" (zhuó, pronounced as zhí yuē qiē, sounds like zhuó), the sound cut out by "职约" (zhí yuē) is different from "酌" (zhuó) (and is a sound that does not exist in Mandarin); "允, 欲窘切, 音尹" (yǔn, pronounced as yù jiǒng qiē, sounds like yǐn), the sound cut out by "欲窘" (yù jiǒng) is different from "尹" (yǐn). What should the reader do? (In the former case, the zhíyīn is correct, and the fǎnqiè is wrong; in the latter case, the fǎnqiè is correct, and the zhíyīn is wrong.) In short, using Chinese characters to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters is difficult, and there are many opportunities for errors. With pinyin letters, each letter represents a certain phoneme, and combining them naturally yields the correct pronunciation. There are only twenty-six letters in total, of which V is usually not used, so only twenty-five letters can be used to annotate the pronunciation of all Chinese characters. Wouldn't it be convenient to learn these twenty-five letters and the pinyin method, so that you can read the sound of any Chinese character according to the annotation?
    Second, pinyin letters can be used to help learn Mandarin. The Han nationality has nearly six hundred million people, and although they use the same language, Chinese, dialects are diverse, and people from different regions often have difficulty communicating, which has an adverse impact on popularizing and improving culture and carrying out socialist construction. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously promote Mandarin so that everyone can speak a common spoken language in addition to their own local dialect. The differences between dialects and Mandarin are manifested in three aspects: pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. To learn Mandarin, you have to learn all three aspects. Grammar and vocabulary can be learned through written materials, but only pronunciation is passed down orally and aurally and must be taught by someone. However, there are so many people who want to learn Mandarin, and if everyone has to be taught by someone for several months, where are so many teachers to teach them? It would be good to have pinyin letters. Writing out Mandarin words and sentences in pinyin letters can be used as a textbook for learning Mandarin. As long as you study with a teacher for a short period, you can use this textbook to continue learning on your own. If the textbook is not written in pinyin letters but in Chinese characters, learning will easily be affected by the dialect pronunciation of the Chinese characters, the pronunciation will be incorrect, and Mandarin will be difficult to learn well. Using phonetic symbols is an effective way to learn spoken language, which has been fully proven in language teaching. Not only in the case of using non-phonetic Chinese characters, it is necessary to compile pinyin spoken language textbooks, but even if the writing system used is basically phonetic, but the spelling and pronunciation are not completely consistent, such as English and French, you have to use textbooks written in phonetic symbols to learn spoken language well.
    The above two items can be summarized as one function: pronunciation correction. This is the main use of pinyin letters at the present stage. Before this, phonetic symbols were also used as a tool for pronunciation correction, and dictionaries and language teaching have been widely used, playing a certain role in unifying pronunciation and assisting literacy education. However, phonetic symbols still have shortcomings: the shapes of the characters are difficult to distinguish, and the strokes are inconvenient to write in succession. More importantly: it is not an internationally used alphabet, which is not conducive to cultural exchange. After a person learns phonetic symbols, they still have to learn the Latin alphabet when studying mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other sciences and technologies. Now that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme adopts the Latin alphabet, this problem is solved, and from now on, there is no need to learn one set and then learn a second set.
    In addition to pronunciation correction, pinyin letters have other uses. Let us talk about them in order.
    Third, Chinese pinyin letters can be used as the basis for ethnic minorities to create writing systems. Our country is a multi-ethnic country. In addition to the Han nationality, there are many fraternal ethnic groups, many of which do not yet have a common writing system, and some, although they have a writing system, have shortcomings and need to be reformed. What writing system should these fraternal ethnic groups adopt to create or reform their writing systems? In order to facilitate mutual learning between ethnic groups, and in order to facilitate the absorption of nouns and terms from Chinese, it is best to adopt a writing system that is the same as that of the Han nationality. The Han nationality now uses Chinese characters. It is very difficult to create writing systems for fraternal ethnic groups based on Chinese characters. It can even be said to be impossible. In the past, some fraternal ethnic groups in the southwest region have made such attempts, but none of them have succeeded. When the New Yi script was created a few years ago, the Latin alphabet was adopted. At that time, the Chinese pinyin scheme was still hesitating between the Latin alphabet and the national form derived from the strokes of Chinese characters. People of the Yi ethnic group were very worried about the New Yi script. When the Zhuang script was created the year before last, the Chinese pinyin scheme had already decided to adopt the Latin alphabet, so it was no problem for the Zhuang script to adopt the Latin alphabet as well. However, there was still some hesitation in the arrangement of the alphabet table, because it was not known what the details of the Chinese pinyin scheme would be when it was finally determined. Now that the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been announced, the fraternal ethnic groups that need to create a writing system feel relieved, and those who have drafted plans that are not well connected with the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme are also working on adjustments. This shows how important the determination of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to the writing system problems of ethnic minorities in our country and even the entire cultural and educational undertaking.
    Fourth, the Chinese pinyin letters can solve the translation problems of personal names, place names, and scientific and technological terms. In the past, foreigners used a variety of pinyin systems to spell the personal names and place names of our country. Not only did English, French, and German each have their own spelling methods, but even within English, there were the Wade-Giles system, the Postal system, and other methods, which can be said to be quite chaotic. Our own foreign language publications and foreign documents, because we did not stipulate a set of rules for spelling Chinese characters in Latin letters, can only follow their spelling methods, which is both unreasonable and inconvenient. Now that we have the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, there are certain rules to follow when transliterating the personal names and place names of our country. The previous chaotic situation can be terminated. When it becomes popular, foreigners will also reform their spelling methods and adopt our spelling methods. This is one aspect. On the other hand, we know that Chinese characters are not suitable for use as a phonetic tool, but we have to use Chinese characters to transliterate foreign personal names and place names. As a result, we have "斯库达列夫斯基" (Sīkùdálièfūsījī) and "乌斯特卡米诺哥尔斯克" (Wūsītekǎmínuògēěrsīkè), which are not easy to pronounce or remember, and "普希金" (Pǔxījīn) and "普式庚" (Pǔshìgēng), whose spellings are inconsistent and difficult to unify. Now that we have the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, as long as we stipulate a few rules for transliteration, foreign personal names and place names can have fixed forms in Chinese. Translators and readers can save a lot of trouble.
    There are also terms in science and technology, most of which are internationally used. Although there are slight changes in spelling due to different national languages, they can still be recognized at a glance. This is extremely convenient for cultural exchange. Only our country, due to the difficulty of phonetic translation using Chinese characters, has always adopted the method of semantic translation. As a result, first, the translated names are inconsistent and confusing. Even the difference in translated names is mistaken for different things. Whether translators or learners feel extremely headache. As a result, unifying the translated names has become an indispensable task, consuming a lot of scientists' time and energy, but the effect is still difficult to satisfy. Secondly, even if the translated names are unified, scientific workers still have to learn the internationally used set of terms, otherwise they will not be able to refer to foreign literature. Our students' burden in memorizing terms alone is doubled compared to students in other countries, which has a certain adverse effect on the forward development of science and technology in our country. Now that we have the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, we can appropriately consider the translation of terms. All the more specialized terms, which are only used among scientific workers, can be transliterated using Chinese pinyin letters. In this way, we can save the labor of translators, saving the trouble of "hesitating for months to establish a name", greatly reduce the work of unifying translated names, and facilitate scientific workers to refer to foreign literature and absorb advanced scientific achievements from the world. (See Liu Zexian: "The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is the Basis for Unifying Translated Names," "Chinese Language" December 1957 issue.)
    Fifth, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can solve the problem of compiling dictionaries, indexes, and other things that require "character retrieval." The Latin alphabet has a great use in cultural work: arranging everything that can be arranged according to the alphabet in the order of the letters. Because there are only twenty-six letters in the alphabet, and there is a fixed order, the arrangement is simple and rigorous; searching for an item inside, you can find it quickly, it is there if it is there, and it is not there if it is not there, you do not have to try in many ways. Chinese characters are not like that. The number of Chinese characters is large, there are thousands of commonly used ones, and there is no fixed order, so it is very difficult to arrange them. There are many kinds of Chinese character retrieval methods: radical retrieval method, stroke count retrieval method, stroke order retrieval method, four-corner numeral retrieval method, and many other retrieval methods that are not as famous as these, but none of them are easy to learn and efficient. (Therefore, there are still many people racking their brains, trying to invent new retrieval methods.) There are many places that need character retrieval, first of all, compiling dictionaries. Because the character retrieval problem has not been well solved, few intellectuals in our country have the habit of using dictionaries. Secondly, academic works in foreign countries are accompanied by indexes, which are very convenient to consult, while in our country, only a few are accompanied by indexes, also because character retrieval is inconvenient. In addition, there are name lists, place name lists, data, archives, telephone directories, commodity books, and many things that need character retrieval, but because there is no simple character retrieval method, the efficiency of using these things cannot be improved. The simplest character retrieval method is to arrange according to the alphabet. In fact, we have to take this path. The "Guoyu Dictionary" and the "Homophone Dictionary" are both arranged in "phonetic order," and the "Xinhua Dictionary" has a "phonetic order version." The various indexes printed by the Harvard-Yenching Institute are not arranged in phonetic order themselves, but they have to be accompanied by pinyin retrieval, and most of the people who use these indexes do so through pinyin retrieval. The comparison of the efficiency of pinyin retrieval and non-pinyin retrieval can be illustrated by one thing: the Beijing Union Medical College Hospital has more than 700,000 medical records, arranged in phonetic order of name, and it is very quick to look them up. Some hospitals have only a fraction of the number of medical records of the Union Medical College Hospital, but it takes much longer to look them up because they are not arranged in phonetic order. It can be seen that the character retrieval problem can only be completely solved by applying phonetic order arrangement, and the so-called phonetic order arrangement is to first pinyin the Chinese characters and then arrange them according to the order of the pinyin letters. In the past, there were relatively few people who understood pinyin, so phonetic order retrieval was not popular. Now that we have the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, everyone will be learning this scheme, and phonetic order retrieval can be widely promoted, which will not only add a powerful tool to cultural work, but also improve the efficiency of other aspects of work.
    Sixth, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can solve the problems of telegrams, flag signals, and the application of written character codes. The telegram currently used in our country is the so-called "four-code telegram," which uses four digits to represent a Chinese character. Therefore, sending a telegram requires a translation procedure first, and receiving a telegram requires another translation procedure. The time spent on these two translations is several times more than the time it takes for the telegram itself to be transmitted. A telegraph operator must be familiar with the numerical codes of thousands of Chinese characters, and must undergo a long period of training, and still cannot completely get rid of the codebook. Because it requires two translations, telegrams are more prone to errors. In the past, many people tried to improve the Chinese character telegram, but the results were not great. Only by replacing numerical codes with pinyin letters can we improve the rate, save manpower, ensure quality, and reduce costs. After liberation, the Northeast Railway System piloted Latinized New Writing telegrams with remarkable results, which has fully proven this point. Now that the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been announced, more and more people will understand pinyin letters, and pinyin telegrams are in a position to be gradually promoted.
    Flag signals are used in navigation and other occasions, but it is impossible to use Chinese characters to send flag signals. In the past, the navigation industry in our country used English flag signals, which is not only unreasonable, but also takes a lot of effort to train a flag signal talent. With Chinese pinyin letters, this is no longer a problem.
    There are many types of industrial products, and the same type of product has various specifications, which often require the use of letters and numerical codes as codes. In the past, because there were no formal pinyin letters, the codes were quite chaotic, some using phonetic symbols, and some using English or Russian letters. After the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is announced, this aspect will also be much more convenient.
    The above are some of the more significant uses of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. In addition, there are other uses that can be exploited. Pinyin letters are an indispensable thing in modern civilization. They play a direct role in culture and education, and indirectly serve production and construction. Therefore, it is absolutely correct to say that the formulation and promotion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a major event in the cultural life of our people.

    拼音字母有哪些用处？
    吕叔湘
    汉语拼音方案草案已经在上月11日由国务院公布了。自从1956年2月中国文字改革委员会发表汉语拼音方案的第一个草案以来，曾经经过全国各方面人士的广泛讨论，国务院汉语拼音方案审订委员会的反复审议和多次修订，最后才由国务院通过公布，并且决定提交全国人民代表大会下次会议讨论批准。在这两年里，各界人士或是参加讨论，或是直接给中国文字改革委员会写信，对拼音方案提出了许多宝贵的意见和不同的要求，这些意见和要求在拼音方案草案的修改和审订的过程中都得到认真的考虑和尽可能的满足。另一方面，第一个草案公布之后就已经有广大群众表示热烈的欢迎和拥护，主动学习，多方面试验应用，并且不断地催询什么时候可以正式确定。这可以证明群众对于汉语拼音方案的需要和盼望是十分殷切的。人民日报社论说：“制定和推行汉语拼音方案是当前文字改革的一项重要任务，是我国人民文化生活中的一件大事。”这句话一点也不错。但是社会上也还有些人，因为平时不大注意这个问题，骤然听见这样的说法，难免有所怀疑：“拼音字母都有哪些用处，值得这样重视？”我们打算在这里简单地回答这个问题。在叙述拼音字母的各种用处之前，还必须先说明：拼音字母不等于拼音文字。汉字是否改革成拼音文字，需要继续研究讨论，不是目前所要解决的问题。拼音字母，不作为拼音文字的工具，也将在我国的文化教育事业中发挥巨大的作用。
    第一，拼音字母可以用来给汉字注音。汉字有一个特点：字形和字音之间没有直接的和系统的联系。世界上绝大多数的文字是表音的，这就是说，看了字形就能读出字音（尽管有些文字，如英语，由于历史的原因，它的拼法和读音有些地方参差不齐）。唯独汉字不是这样，看了字形不能马上读出字音，必得有人教，或是查字典。字典里注音，从前有两种办法，一种是反切，一种是直音，尤其是反切法用得最多。不但像康熙字典等老字典，就是现代出版的辞源、辞海，也还是主要用反切法，有时用直音法来补充。这两种注音法都有缺点。反切法用两个汉字快速连续使它成为一个音。用这个方法注音，选的反切字必须便于连读，否则就会有困难。例如“渠，群余切”（引辞海注音作例，下同），“群余”就不便于连读。（反切法本来有一条规则，就是，上一字只取它的声母，下一字只取它的韵母，可是一般用字典的人不一定懂得这个规则。）直音法用一个字注另一个字，避免了反切的麻烦。可是同音的字有生有熟，用熟字注生字，没有问题；用生字注生字，就不能起注音的作用。例如“惕，音逖”，不认得“惕”字的人大概也不认得“逖”字，这个注音就算白注了。反切法和直音法还有共同的缺点：汉字的读音古今有变化，各地也不一致，因此有时候按字典上的反切或直音来读反而会读错。例如“松，徐容切”，读出来是“熊”；“兀，吴滑切”，读出来是“娃”。反切和直音同时并用，好像给读者更多方便，——用这个法子不能达到目的还可以用那个法子，——可是有时候也造成混乱。例如“灼，职约切，音酌”，用“职约”切出来的音跟“酌”不一样（并且是普通话里没有的音）；“允，欲窘切，音尹”，用“欲窘”切出来的音跟“尹”不一样。叫读者何去何从呢？（前者是直音对了，反切不对；后者是反切对了，直音不对。）总之，用汉字给汉字注音，困难多，错误的机会也不少。有了拼音字母，每个字母代表一定的音素，彼此拼合，自然得出正确的读音。一共才二十六个字母，其中V平常用不着，只二十五个字母就能给全部汉字注音。学会这二十五个字母和拼音的方法，就能按照注音读出任何汉字的音，岂不方便？
    第二，拼音字母可以用来帮助学习普通话。汉民族有近六亿的人口，尽管使用的是同一语言，汉语，可是方言纷歧，不同地区的人往往通话有困难，这对于普及和提高文化，进行社会主义建设事业，都有不利的影响。因此必须大力推广普通话，使人人除了自己的家乡话之外都能说一种共同的口语。方言和普通话的分别表现在语音、语法、语汇三方面，学习普通话，三个方面都得学习。语法和语汇可以通过书面材料来学习，只有语音是口耳相传，非有人教不可。可是要学普通话的人这么多，要是每人都要有人教上几个月，哪有这么多教师来教呢？有了拼音字母就好了。把普通话的词句用拼音字母写出来，就可以作为学习普通话的课本。只要跟教师学习一个短时期，就可以利用这种课本自己继续学下去。如果不是用拼音字母写成的课本而是用汉字写成的课本，学习起来就容易受汉字的方言读音的影响，发音不正确，普通话就难学好。利用音标是学习口语的有效办法，这已经在语言教学中得到充分证明。不但在使用不表音的汉字这种情况下，有必要另编拼音的口语课本，就是所用文字基本上是表音的，但是拼法和读音不完全相符，像英语和法语，要学好口语也得利用音标写成的课本。
    以上两项总起来说是一个作用：正音。这是拼音字母在现阶段的主要用途。在这以前，注音字母也曾经被用来作正音的工具，字典注音和语文教学都曾广泛利用，在统一读音和辅助扫盲教育方面起过一定的作用。可是注音字母还是有缺点，字形较难分辨，笔画不便连写。更重要的是：它不是国际通用的字母，不便于文化交流。一个人学会了注音字母，在学习数学、物理、化学以及其他科学技术的时候，仍然不得不学习拉丁字母。现在汉语拼音方案采用拉丁字母，这个问题就解决了，从此以后不必学了一套再学第二套了。
    除了正音，拼音字母还有别的用处，让我们顺次说下去。
    第三，汉语拼音字母可以用来做少数民族创造文字的基础。我国是个多民族的国家，汉族以外还有很多兄弟民族，其中有许多至今还没有通用文字，有些虽有文字但是有缺点，需要改革。这些兄弟民族创制或是改革文字，应该采用什么文字系统呢？为了便于民族之间相互学习，为了便于从汉语吸收名词、术语，最好是能采取跟汉族的文字系统相同的文字。汉族现在用的是汉字，用汉字做基础为兄弟民族创造文字是很困难的，竟可以说是办不到的。过去西南地区有些兄弟民族做过这种尝试，都没有成功。早几年创制新彝文的时候，采用了拉丁字母，那时候汉语的拼音方案还在拉丁字母和由汉字笔画变化出来的民族形式之间徘徊不定，彝族人士对于新彝文就很有顾虑。到了前年创制僮文的时候，汉语拼音方案已经决定采用拉丁字母，僮文采用拉丁字母也就不成问题，但是在字母表的安排上也还有些踌躇，因为不知道汉语拼音方案的细节最后确定下来是怎么样。现在汉语拼音方案草案已经公布，需要创制文字的兄弟民族心里都踏实了，已经拟制的方案有跟汉语拼音方案的联系得不够好的也都在从事调整。这可以说明，汉语拼音方案的确定对于我国少数民族的文字问题以至整个文化教育事业，关系如何重大。
    第四，汉语拼音字母可以解决人名、地名和科学技术术语的翻译问题。过去外国人拼写我国的人名、地名有多种多样的拼音系统，不但英语、法语、德语各有各的拼法，单是英语里就有威妥玛式、邮政式，还有其他方式，可说是相当混乱。我们自己的外语出版物以及对外文件，因为自己没有规定一套用拉丁字母拼写汉字的法式，也只能沿用他们的拼法，既不合理，也不便利。现在有了汉语拼音方案，转写我国人名、地名有一定的规则可循，以往的混乱局面可以终止，等到行开了以后，外国人也会改革他们的拼法，采取我们的拼法，这是一方面。另一方面，我们明知汉字不适合作标音的工具，可是转写外国的人名、地名又不得不用汉字。结果是“斯库达列夫斯基”、“乌斯特卡米诺哥尔斯克”，既不好念，更难记忆，而且“普希金”、“普式庚”，用字纷歧，难于统一。现在有了汉语拼音方案，只要规定几条转写的规则，外国人名、地名在汉语里都可以有固定的形式，译者和读者都可以省去不少麻烦。
    还有科学技术方面的术语，其中绝大部分都是国际通用的，虽然由于各国文字不同，在拼法上略有变化，还是可以一望而知。这对于文化交流是极其便利的。只有我国，由于用汉字译音的困难，一向采用意译的办法。结果，第一是译名纷歧，莫衷一是，甚至因为译名之异而误会为事物不同，无论翻译者或是学习者都感到极其头疼，以致统一译名成为必不可少的工作，耗费许多科学家的时间和精力而效果还是难于满意。其次，即使译名统一了，科学工作者仍然不得不学习国际通用的那一套术语，否则就无法参考外国文献。单是在术语的记忆上，我国学生的负担就比别的国家的学生加一倍，这对于我国科学技术的向前发展有一定的不利影响。现在有了汉语拼音方案，我们在术语的翻译上就可以适当地考虑一下，凡是比较专门的术语，只在科学工作者中间应用的，都可以用汉语拼音字母转写。这样一来，既可节省翻译工作者的劳力，省得“一名之立，旬月踟蹰”，又可以大大减少统一译名的工作，更可以便利科学工作者参考外国文献，吸取世界先进科学成果。（参看刘泽先：“汉语拼音方案是统一译名的基础”，“中国语文”1957年12月号。）
    第五，汉语拼音方案可以解决编字典、编索引以及其他需要“检字”的问题。拉丁字母在文化工作中有一项极大的用处：依照字母的次序编排一切可以依照字母编排的东西。因为字母只有二十六个，又有固定次序，所以编排起来，既简单，又严密；在里边寻找一个项目，很快就能查到，有就有，没有就没有，不必多方试探。汉字则不然。汉字的数目多，常用的也有几千，又没有一定的次序，编排起来十分为难。汉字的检字法种类很多，部首检字法、笔数检字法、笔顺检字法、四角号码检字法，还有许多不像这些个有名的检字法，可是没有一种是容易学而又效率高的。（因此，还有不少人在绞脑汁，企图发明新的检字法。）需要检字的地方很多，首先是编字典。因为检字问题没有很好地解决，我国知识分子中间很少人有用字典的习惯。其次，学术性的著作在外国都附有索引，查阅非常便利，在我国则附有索引的是少数，也是因为检字不便。此外，人名表、地名表、资料、档案、电话簿、商品簿，需要检字的东西是很多的，但是因为没有简便的检字法，这些东西的使用效率就提不高。最简便的检字法是依照字母排列，事实上也已经不得不走这条路。“国语辞典”和“同音字典”都是依“音序”编排的，“新华字典”有“音序本”。哈佛燕京学社所印的各种索引，本身不依音序排列，但是不得不附拼音检字，而用这些索引的人多半是通过拼音检字的。拼音检字和非拼音检字的效率的比较，可以用一件事情来说明：北京协和医院的病历有七十多万张，按姓名的音序排列，查起来很快，有些医院的病历只有协和医院的几分之一，可是因为不依音序排列，查起来就慢得多。可见检字问题只有应用音序排列才能彻底解决，所谓音序排列就是先把汉字拼音然后依照拼音字母的次序编排。过去懂得拼音的人还是比较少，所以音序检字还不普及。现在有了汉语拼音方案，大家都将要学习这个方案，音序检字可以普遍推广，不但文化工作上增加了一个有力的工具，就是其他方面的办事效率也将因此而有所提高。
    第六，汉语拼音方案可以解决电报、旗语以及应用文字代号的问题。我国现在用的电报是所谓“四码电报”，就是用四位数字代表一个汉字，因此拍发电报先得经过一道翻译手续，收到电报又得经过一道翻译手续。这两道翻译所费的时间比电报本身传递的时间要多好几倍。一个电报员要熟习几千个汉字的数码，必须经过长时期的训练，也还不能完全脱离电码本。因为要经过两道翻译，电报就更容易发生错误。过去有很多人想办法改良汉字电报，成绩都不大。只有用拼音字母代替数码，才能提高速率，节省人力，保证质量，降低成本。解放后东北铁路系统试办拉丁化新文字电报，成绩显著，已经完全证明了这一点。现在汉语拼音方案草案已经公布，懂得拼音字母的人将越来越多，拼音电报就有条件逐步推广了。
    旗语在航海以及别的场合都用得着，可是要用汉字打旗语，那是无法办到的。我国航海界过去用过英语旗语，这不但是不合理，而且训练一个旗语人材也要费大事。有了汉语拼音字母，这也就不成问题了。
    工业产品种类繁多，同类产品又有各种规格，常常需要用字母加数码作代号。以往因为没有正式的拼音字母，代号相当乱，有用注音字母的，有用英语或俄语字母的。汉语拼音方案公布之后，这方面也便利多了。
    以上是汉语拼音方案的较显著的一些用途，此外也还有可供利用之处。拼音字母是近代文明中不可缺少的东西，直接在文化教育上起作用，间接为生产建设服务。所以说制定和推行汉语拼音方案是我国人民文化生活中的一件大事，这句话一点也不错。
