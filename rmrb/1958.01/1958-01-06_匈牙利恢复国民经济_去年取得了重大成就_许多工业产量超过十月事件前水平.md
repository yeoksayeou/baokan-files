Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 3rd: In 1957, Hungary achieved significant success in restoring its national economy, which had been damaged by the counter-revolutionary events of October 1956. The annual industrial and agricultural production plans were fully completed, and some sectors exceeded their annual production targets.

In industry, the coal and electricity industries, which are crucial for the recovery of the national economy, completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule on December 18th. By the time the plan was completed, a total of 20.5 million tons of coal and 5.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity had been produced. The metallurgical, chemical, light industrial, and other industrial sectors also exceeded their annual production plans successively on December 6th and 10th last year.

In the past year, the average monthly production indicators of some industrial sectors have reached or exceeded the levels before the October 1956 events. For example, in the first eleven months of 1957, the average monthly output of the light industry sector exceeded the pre-event average monthly production level by 2.7%, while the production volume in November was 20% higher than the pre-event average monthly output for the entire year. Overall, although the average monthly industrial output for the entire year last year was still lower than the average monthly output before the October events, the output in October last year exceeded this level.

In 1957, Hungary's agricultural production level greatly exceeded that of 1956. According to newspaper reports, Hungarian agricultural workers exceeded the annual agricultural production plan by 4.8% last year. Among them, agricultural product output was 4.5% higher than the original plan, and livestock product output was 5.2% higher than the original plan.

In the past year, Hungary has also achieved success in agricultural collectivization. Most of the agricultural cooperatives that were dissolved due to the impact of the counter-revolutionary events have been re-established, and new cooperatives have been established in some places. The production performance of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions is also very good, and their grain yield per unit area is 30% higher than that of individual farmers.

Due to the rapid recovery of industrial and agricultural production, as well as the assistance from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, the supply of daily necessities for the Hungarian people is now guaranteed, the threat of inflation has been eliminated, and the people's lives have not only been restored to the pre-event level but have also improved.

    匈牙利恢复国民经济  去年取得了重大成就
    许多工业产量超过十月事件前水平
    据新华社布达佩斯3日电　1957年，匈牙利在恢复因1956年10月反革命事件而遭受破坏的国民经济方面，取得了巨大的成就。全年的工农业生产计划已经全部完成，有些部门超额完成了年度生产计划。
    在工业方面，对恢复国民经济有决定意义的采煤工业和电力工业都在12月18日提前完成了年度生产计划，到计划完成时为止共生产了两千零五十万吨煤和五十三亿度电力。冶金、化学、轻工业等工业部门也在去年12月6日和10日先后超额完成了年度生产计划。
    在过去一年中，有些工业部门每月的平均生产指标已经达到或者超过了1956年10月事件前的水平。例如，在1957年头十一个月中，轻工业部门的平均月产量已经超过了事件前每月平均生产水平的2.7％，而11月份的生产量则比事件前全年平均月产量高20％。整个说来，虽然去年全年的工业平均月产量还低于十月事件前的平均月产量，但是去年10月份的产量则超过了这一水平。
    1957年，匈牙利的农业生产水平大大超过了1956年。据报纸报道，去年匈牙利农业劳动者超额4.8％完成了全年的农业生产计划。其中，农产品产量比原计划高4.5％，畜产品产量比原计划高5.2％。
    过去一年中，匈牙利在农业生产合作化方面也取得了成就。由于反革命事件的影响而解散的农业合作社大部分已经重新建立起来，有些地方还建立了新的合作社。各地农业生产合作社的生产成绩也很好，它们的谷物单位面积产量要比个体农户高30％。
    由于工农业生产的迅速恢复以及苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，现在匈牙利人民生活必需品的供应已经有了保证，通货膨胀的威胁已经消除，人民生活不但已经恢复到事件前的水平，而且还有了提高。
