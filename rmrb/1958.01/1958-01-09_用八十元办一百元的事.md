Using Eighty Yuan to Accomplish One Hundred Yuan's Worth of Work
Wen Ying

In implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality, every unit should try every possible means to spend less money and accomplish more, or even accomplish things well without spending money. This year, many industrial departments have proposed to accomplish one hundred yuan's worth of work with eighty yuan when arranging new production and construction tasks. The news from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry published in today's newspaper mentions this point. We believe that this matter is worthy of great promotion.

Building the country through diligence and frugality is a very concrete matter. It is naturally difficult to spend less money and accomplish more, to have the horse run fast while eating less grass. However, as long as we adopt a positive attitude, promote a spirit of hard work and simplicity, give play to the wisdom of the masses, and truly practice careful calculation, the difficulties encountered in our work can be overcome. In order to reduce investment in field drilling, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry advocates building fewer roads and houses and utilizing more trails and tents in exploration areas; it advocates the extensive use of light drilling rigs to drill small exploratory wells. From these deployments, it seems that their determination to overcome difficulties is great, and there are many ways to save. Moreover, in many enterprises, wasteful phenomena still exist widely. As long as we conduct a serious inspection and expose them, the potential for savings is great. The example of the Meilin Cannery published in yesterday's newspaper proves this point.

We often see that some enterprises can accomplish more with the same amount of money or less, or produce more and better products with the same or even inferior production equipment, while other enterprises cannot. Why is there such a difference between the advanced and the backward? We believe that the primary reason is the lack of a concept of building the country through diligence and frugality in their thinking. Because of this, they do not exploit the potential that can be tapped, they do not try to overcome the difficulties that can be overcome, and they do not save the funds that can be saved. For example, recently some factories in Beijing have been reaching out to the state for money and people under the pretext of "more and faster." Some factories are requesting increased investment that even exceeds the enterprise's planned profit for the entire year. According to their view, to increase production, it is necessary to increase investment; to reduce investment, it is only possible to accomplish less; to produce good things, it is necessary to use good production equipment, otherwise, quality cannot be guaranteed; as for how to strive to eliminate waste and practice strict economy subjectively, they rarely consider it. Comrades in these enterprises, think carefully about yourselves. Does what you are doing conform to the spirit of building the country through diligence and frugality?

    用八十元办一百元的事
    文英
    在贯彻执行勤俭建国方针的时候，任何单位都应该想尽一切办法，做到少花钱、多办事，或者不花钱也能把事办好。今年有不少工业部门，在安排新的生产建设任务的时候，提出了用八十元钱办一百元钱的事。今天本报发表的石油工业部的消息中，就讲到这一点。我们认为这件事值得大大提倡。
    勤俭建国是一件十分具体的事情。既要少用钱，又要多办事，既要马儿好，又要马儿少吃草，困难自然是很多的。但是，只要我们采取积极的态度，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，发挥群众的智慧，真正作到精打细算，那么，工作中所遇到的困难是可以克服的。石油工业部为了减少野外钻井的投资，提倡在勘探地区要少修路、少盖住房，多利用便道、多住帐篷；提倡大量采用轻型钻探机钻小眼探井。从这些部署看来，他们克服困难的决心是很大的，节约的办法也是很多的。而何况在许多企业里，浪费的现象还普遍存在，只要认真检查，揭发一下，节约的潜力是很大的，昨天本报发表的梅林罐头厂的事例就证明了这一点。
    我们常常看到有一些企业，他们可以用同样多或较少的钱，就能办更多的事，或者用同样的甚至较差的生产设备，生产出更多更好的东西来，而另一些企业却做不到。为什么会产生这种先进和落后的差别？我们认为，首先是思想上缺乏勤俭建国的观念。正因为如此，明明可以挖掘的潜力就不去挖掘，可以克服的困难也没有想尽办法去克服，可以节省的资金也没有节省。例如，北京市最近就有一些工厂，借口“又多、又快”，伸手向国家要钱要人。有的厂要求增加的投资，甚至超过了企业全年的计划利润。按照他们的看法，要增产，就要增加投资；要减少投资，就只有少办事；要生产好东西就要用好的生产设备，否则，就不能保证质量；至于主观上如何努力去想尽办法消除浪费厉行节约，却很少考虑。这些企业的同志，好好想一想自己，我的所做所为，符合勤俭建国的精神吗？
