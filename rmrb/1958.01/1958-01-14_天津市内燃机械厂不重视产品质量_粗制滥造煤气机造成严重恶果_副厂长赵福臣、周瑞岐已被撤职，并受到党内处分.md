Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant Disregards Product Quality
Shoddily Made Gas Generators Cause Serious Consequences
Deputy Directors Zhao Fuchen and Zhou Ruiqi Have Been Removed from Their Positions and Received Party Disciplinary Actions

(Our report) The gas generators and dual diesel-gas generators produced by the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant are of very poor quality, wasting state funds and causing significant losses to agricultural production. The Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Machinery and Electrical Industries, and other units conducted inspections on this issue in the second half of last year. Recently, the Xinhau District Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Tianjin and the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Machinery and Electrical Industries have taken action against the relevant personnel who neglected their duties.

From June 1956 to June 1957, the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant produced 1,904 gas generators and dual diesel-gas generators. 1,663 units have been sold, distributed in 18 provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Tianjin. These machines have defects such as small volume of the internal combustion engine gasifier, lack of filters, insufficient wind power from the hand-cranked blower, and malfunctioning governors, making them difficult to start and mostly unusable. In eleven provinces and cities, including Hubei, Guangdong, and Hebei, the relevant units requested returns of 1,114 units.

The total value of the more than 1,900 gas generators and dual diesel-gas generators produced by this factory is over 2.97 million yuan. Currently, the state has lost more than 1.07 million yuan, including fuel costs for trial runs, travel expenses for sending people to repair them, replacement parts, and preliminary estimated modification costs.

This batch of low-quality machines has caused considerable losses to farmers and agricultural production. For example, the Huaguang Agricultural Cooperative in Echeng County, Hubei Province, bought two gas generators from this factory, spent a lot of work installing the machines, burned more than 3,000 catties of charcoal, and spent more than 300 yuan on repairs and purchasing parts, but the machines could only be used for seven or eight hours before they became unusable. In Hebei and other places, some agricultural cooperatives used the factory's machines for drought resistance and drainage, but they could not function effectively, resulting in some crops dying from drought and some farmland being flooded. Some farmers in Guangdong, Hubei, and other places even criticized the government for selling bad machines to deceive farmers; this kind of political loss is quite serious.

According to inspections by the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Bureau, the Bureau of Machinery and Electrical Industries, and other units, the poor quality of the factory's products is mainly due to chaotic production management and the factory leaders' serious capitalist business ideology. This factory originally produced iron shovels and water pumps. In 1956, in order to support agricultural production, it began to manufacture more precise gas generators and dual diesel-gas generators. Faced with new tasks, the factory leaders did not diligently and responsibly try to overcome some of the difficulties in equipment and technology to ensure the task was completed well. On the contrary, they only saw the development of the factory, blindly boasted and became complacent, and adopted a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude from the beginning. They did not follow the new product trial procedures and carried out mass production without strict appraisal. Over the past year, many employees of the factory have continuously raised opinions about shoddy workmanship and poor product quality, but the factory leaders turned a deaf ear and ignored them. They only pursued the factory's superficial production achievements and profits, without considering what impact the sale of the products would have on the state and the people. Even when farmers in various places wrote letters reflecting that the machines were unusable and requesting repairs and returns, the factory leaders still did not examine their mistakes and make serious improvements, but repeatedly emphasized that "farmers do not understand technology and do not know how to use them," and continued to produce shoddy products. They even resorted to deception and self-deception to cover up the machine's faults, allowing unqualified products to leave the factory.

Based on the above situation, the Xinhua District Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Tianjin and the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Machinery and Electrical Industries recently took serious action against the relevant personnel who neglected their duties. Zhao Fuchen, the deputy director in charge of technology, received a disciplinary warning of being placed on probation within the Party for one year and an administrative punishment of removal from his post; Zhou Ruiqi, the deputy director, received a disciplinary punishment of removal from his position within the Party and an administrative punishment of removal from his post; Liu Wenxiang, the factory director who arrived at the factory in October 1956, received an administrative demerit and was required to make a profound self-criticism within the Party; Fang Chengren, the former Party branch secretary, received a serious warning from within the Party. Other personnel who neglected their duties were also dealt with separately.

Regarding this batch of low-quality machines produced by the factory, the State Council has decided on a solution: all machines currently in stock at supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must be removed from sale; those that cannot be used after repeated repairs and are requested for return will be taken back by the supply and marketing cooperatives at the original price; and the factory will be responsible for compensating the direct expenses incurred by agricultural cooperatives due to the use of this machine, such as transportation fees and repair costs.

On the 10th, the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant held a general meeting of all employees, announcing the punishments for the relevant personnel who neglected their duties. At the meeting, the heads of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Machinery and Electrical Industries and the Xinhua District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Tianjin also reviewed their failure to promptly check and stop this serious mistake, and mobilized all employees to carry out a large-scale airing of views and rectification, focusing on the shortcomings and errors existing in the factory leadership and the problems existing in production management. Through airing views, rectification, and thorough improvement of product quality, they aimed to better support agricultural production.

    天津市内燃机械厂不重视产品质量
    粗制滥造煤气机造成严重恶果
    副厂长赵福臣、周瑞岐已被撤职，并受到党内处分
    本报讯　天津市内燃机械厂生产的煤气机和柴油煤气两用机质量十分低劣，浪费了国家资金，给农业生产造成了巨大损失。天津市监察局、天津市机电工业局等单位在去年下半年对这一问题进行了检查。最近，中共天津市新华区监察委员会和天津市机电工业局已经对有关失职人员作了处理。
    天津市内燃机械厂从1956年6月到1957年6月生产了一千九百零四台煤气机和柴油煤气两用机。已经卖出去的有一千六百六十三台，分布在山西、陕西、河南、浙江、北京、天津等十八个省市。这些机器因为存在着内燃机煤气炉容积小、缺少过滤器，手摇鼓风机风力不足和调速器不灵等毛病，起动困难，大部分不能使用。仅湖北、广东、河北等十一个省市，经有关单位要求退货的就有一千一百一十四台。
    这个厂生产的一千九百多台煤气机和柴油煤气两用机，总共价值二百九十七万余元。现在，仅试车耗用的燃料费用、派人检修出差费、更换零件以及初步计算的改装费用等项，就使国家损失一百零七万多元。
    这批质量低劣的机器使农民和农业生产受到了相当重大的损失。例如，湖北省鄂城县华光农业社买了这个厂的两台煤气机，安装机器等用了许多工，烧了木炭三千多斤，修配、购买零件花了三百多元，但是机器仅仅开了七、八个小时就不能使用了。河北等地有的农业社在抗旱、排涝中使用这个厂的机器，不能发挥作用，有的旱死了庄稼，有的淹坏了农田。广东、湖北等地有的农民甚至因此批评政府不该卖坏机器哄农民；这种政治上的损失性质相当严重。
    据天津市监察局、机电工业局等单位检查，这个厂产品质量所以如此低劣，主要是因为生产管理混乱、工厂领导人员存在着严重的资本主义经营思想。这个厂原来是生产铁锨和水泵的工厂，在1956年为了支援农业生产，开始制造比较精密的煤气机和柴油煤气两用机。在新的任务面前，这个厂的领导人员不是以兢兢业业、认真负责的精神，努力克服设备上和技术上的一些困难，保证很好地完成任务。相反地，他们却只是看到工厂的发展，盲目地骄傲自满，从一开始就采取了马马虎虎、不负责任的态度，不遵守新产品试制程序，不经严格鉴定，就大批地进行生产。一年来，这个厂许多职工对粗制滥造、产品质量低劣，曾不断提出意见，但是工厂领导方面却当作耳旁风，不加理睬。他们所追求的只是本厂表面上的生产成绩和利润，而不考虑产品出售以后对国家和人民会造成什么影响。甚至当各地农民纷纷写信反映机器不能用、要求修理和退货时，这个厂的领导人员仍然不检查错误，认真改进，竟一再强调什么“农民不懂技术，不会使用”，继续粗制滥造。他们甚至还弄虚作假，以自欺欺人的办法掩盖机器的毛病，允许不合格的产品出厂。
    根据上述情况，中共天津市新华区监察委员会和天津市机电工业局最近对有关失职人员作了严肃的处理。技术副厂长赵福臣受到党内留党察看一年处分和行政撤职处分；副厂长周瑞岐受到党内撤销工作处分和行政撤职处分；1956年10月到厂的厂长刘文祥受到了行政上的记过处分，并要在党内作深刻检讨；原党支部书记方成仁受到党内严重警告处分。其他失职人员也分别作了处理。
    对于这个厂出产的这批质量低劣的机器，国务院已经决定了处理办法：各地供销社现存的机器一律停止出售；经检修多次仍不能使用而要求退货的，由供销社按原价收回；农业社因使用这种机器所花的运杂费、修理费等直接费用，由工厂负责赔偿。
    10日，天津市内燃机械厂召开全体职工大会，宣布了对有关失职人员的处分。会上，天津市机电工业局、中共天津市新华区委员会的负责人，也分别对他们没有能及时检查和制止这一严重错误作了检查，并且动员全厂职工针对工厂领导方面存在的缺点和错误，以及生产管理上存在的问题，进行大鸣大放，通过鸣放、整改彻底改进产品质量，更好地支援农业生产。
