Xinhua News Agency, London, January 4th: TASS London, January 4th: British Prime Minister Macmillan delivered a lengthy speech on basic issues of British foreign policy on London Radio on the evening of the 4th. Macmillan tried his best to defend the foreign policy pursued by the British government. He recklessly touted the notorious North Atlantic Treaty Organization and nuclear weapons as "deterrents." He said that the hydrogen bomb is the "best guarantee of security" and that the sole task of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to "care about maintaining peace."

Macmillan also tried every possible means to defend the British government's decision to allow the United States to establish rocket bases in Britain and U.S. planes carrying hydrogen bombs to fly over British airspace. Macmillan believed that this could "ensure the reliability of British defense."

Macmillan also rudely made some anti-Soviet slanders and distorted reality. He insisted that the Soviet Union ruled the Baltic states and Eastern European countries, insisted that the Soviet Union's policies were the cause of international tension, and insisted that the Soviet Union only talked about hoping to ease tensions in words, but in reality, did not take any measures.

Macmillan avoided mentioning the constructive proposals made by Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin in his letter to him not long ago, which aimed at quickly easing international tensions and eliminating the threat of atomic war.

At the same time, Macmillan assured his listeners that the British government "will continue to strive to reach an agreement with the Russians in the future."

He went on to say that there are two ways to maintain world peace: strengthening the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and holding negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Macmillan said: "We can start by signing a solemn non-aggression treaty. This has been done before. There is no harm in doing so, and it may bring benefits."

He also said: "We must reach an agreement on the testing, use and quantity of nuclear weapons. We must also deal with the so-called conventional armaments issue. Empty talk cannot achieve peace; we also need action."

Xinhua News Agency, January 5th, Washington: After British Prime Minister Macmillan mentioned in his radio speech on the evening of the 4th that a non-aggression treaty could be concluded with the Soviet Union, U.S. officials expressed their opposition to the conclusion of such a treaty on the same day.

According to Reuters, Washington authorities said on the 4th that the United States firmly believes that "at the current stage of international affairs, concluding such a treaty would do more harm than good." A State Department spokesman said on the 4th that Macmillan's mention of this issue in his radio speech on the 4th was "unexpected." He declined to comment on the speech. In addition, news said that senior officials in Washington said they did not know in advance that Macmillan would talk about this issue.

Senate Republican Leader Knowland made a statement expressing his opposition to the conclusion of such a treaty, believing that such a treaty has "no benefits."

    麦克米伦在叫嚷“威慑”和反苏滥调之余
    谈到可同苏联签订互不侵犯条约
    美国官方害怕乱了拍子连忙表示非议
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社伦敦4日讯：英国首相麦克米伦4日晚在伦敦广播电台就英国外交政策的基本问题发表了一篇冗长的演说。麦克米伦挖空心思地为英国政府奉行的外交政策进行辩解。他信口开河地把臭名远扬的北大西洋集团和核武器当做“威慑因素”大加吹嘘。他说，氢弹是“安全的最好保证”，北大西洋集团的唯一任务是“关心维护和平”。
    麦克米伦还千方百计地为英国政府允许美国在英国建立火箭基地和美国载有氢弹的飞机在英国上空飞行的决定辩解，麦克米伦认为，这可以“确保英国防御的可靠性”。
    麦克米伦还粗暴地发表了一些反苏谰言并对现实进行歪曲。他硬说苏联统治了波罗的海沿岸国家和东欧国家，硬说苏联的政策是造成国际紧张局势的原因，硬说苏联只是在口头上谈论希望缓和紧张局势，而实际上却没有采取任何措施。
    麦克米伦避而不谈苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁不久以前在给他的信中提出的旨在尽速缓和国际紧张局势和消除原子战争威胁的建设性建议。
    同时，麦克米伦向他的听众保证：英国政府“今后仍将努力同俄国人达成协议”。
    他接着说，维护世界和平的道路有两条：加强北大西洋集团的实力和同苏联举行谈判。
    麦克米伦说：“我们可以从签订一项庄严的互不侵犯条约开始。这在以前已经做过了。这样做不会有什么害处，而且可能带来好处。”
    他还说：“我们必须就核武器的试验、使用和数量问题达成协议。我们还必须处理所谓常规军备问题。徒托空言是不能获得和平的，我们还需要行动”。
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：在英国首相麦克米伦4日晚的广播演说中谈到可以同苏联签订一项互不侵犯条约以后，美国官方人士在当天就表示反对签订这种条约。
    据路透社报道，华盛顿的权威人士4日说，美国坚持地认为：“在国际事态的现阶段，签订这样一项条约害处要比好处大。”美国国务院的一个发言人在4日说：麦克米伦在4日的广播演说中谈到这个问题是“出乎意料之外的”。他拒绝对这篇演说发表评论。另外有消息说，华盛顿的高级官员说，他们事先不知道麦克米伦谈这个问题。
    参议院共和党领袖诺兰发表了谈话，表示反对签订这种条约，他认为这种条约没有“什么好处”。
