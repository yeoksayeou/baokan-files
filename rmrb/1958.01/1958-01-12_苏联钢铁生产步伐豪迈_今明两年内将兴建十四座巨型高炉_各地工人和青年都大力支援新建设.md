　　(By our Moscow correspondent, 11th) Another great leap forward has occurred in the Soviet steel industry's production. The Soviet Union will build fourteen new giant blast furnaces in the next two years, and the total productive capacity of these furnaces after completion will be equivalent to the total productive capacity of all the blast furnaces in the Soviet Union's first and second five-year plans. The completion of these blast furnaces will increase the annual production of pig iron by several million tons, which is of great significance for the further development of the Soviet national economy.
    The Director of the Ferrous Metallurgy Department of the Soviet State Planning Committee, Boiko, said in this regard that 1958 and 1959 are unique years in the history of Soviet blast furnace construction. Never before has such a large-scale metallurgical industry construction plan been drawn up, nor has such a plan been realized in such a short period of time.
    The construction of these fourteen blast furnaces will utilize the most advanced technology, and four of them will be the largest in the Soviet Union, with all operations automated. Seven blast furnaces will be built first in 1958, and material preparations will be made for the construction of another seven blast furnaces next year. The seven blast furnaces to be built this year will be located in areas with abundant iron ore reserves: Orsk, Chelyabinsk, Krivoy Rog, Dnepropetrovsk, and Zhdanov. Next year, another seven giant blast furnaces will be built in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the Urals, Siberia, and other places.
    In order to ensure the supply of a large amount of ore required when the new blast furnaces start operation, while starting the construction of the blast furnaces, new mines are being vigorously developed and new ore dressing plants are being built.
    The enthusiasm of workers and youth from all over the Soviet Union to support the construction of new blast furnaces is growing. More than 760 members of the Communist Youth League and young people in Chelyabinsk have volunteered to participate in the construction site. The working people and students in this city organized voluntary labor on Sundays to help build new blast furnaces. The builders of this largest blast furnace have issued a challenge competition, and they decided to complete the construction task ahead of schedule before the October Revolution Day this year. Factory workers in many economic regions across the country are also actively producing various construction equipment for new blast furnaces.

    苏联钢铁生产步伐豪迈
    今明两年内将兴建十四座巨型高炉
    各地工人和青年都大力支援新建设
    本报莫斯科11日电　苏联钢铁工业生产上出现了又一个巨大跃进。苏联将在今年和明年两年内建成十四座新的巨型高炉，这些高炉建成后的总生产力，相等于苏联在第一和第二两个五年计划里全部高炉的总生产力。这些高炉的建成将给苏联每年增产数百万吨生铁，对于进一步发展苏联国民经济具有重大意义。
    苏联国家计划委员会黑色冶金部主任波伊科就此发表谈话说，1958年和1959年是苏联高炉建设史上独特的年份，过去从来没有订过这样庞大的冶金工业建设计划，也没有在这样短的时期内实现过这样的计划。
    这十四座高炉的建设将运用最先进的技术，其中有四座高炉将是全苏最大的，全部操作都是自动化。1958年内先建起七座高炉，并为明年建设另外七座高炉作好材料准备。今年建设的七座高炉分别建在铁矿蕴藏丰富的地区：奥尔斯克、车里雅宾斯克、克里伏姆洛格、第聂伯彼得洛夫斯克和日丹诺夫等地。明年将在乌克兰、哈萨克斯坦、乌拉尔、西伯利亚等地建设另外七座巨型高炉。
    为了保证新高炉开工时需要的大量矿石供应，在开始高炉建设同时，大力开采新的矿藏和兴建新的选矿厂。
    全苏各地工人和青年为支援建设新高炉的热情日益增长。车里雅宾斯克七百六十多名共青团员和青年已自愿到建设工地参加工作。这个市区的劳动人民和学生们组织了星期日义务劳动，帮助建设新高炉。这个最大型的高炉建设者们已发出挑战竞赛，他们决定于今年的十月革命节以前提前完成建设任务。全国许多经济区的工厂工人也正在为新高炉积极生产各种建设器材。
