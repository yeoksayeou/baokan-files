On the Question of "National Assimilation"
    Liu Chun

    The development of socialist ethnic relations domestically is manifested not only generally as the unity, solidarity, equality, mutual assistance, common development, and common prosperity between the state and various ethnic groups, and between brotherly ethnic groups within the socialist family of the motherland, but also increasingly and more universally as the fraternal and comradely relationship of common labor and common life among members of all ethnic groups in cooperatives, factories, enterprises, schools, armies, state organs, Party organs, League organs, and mass organizations. This is reflected in:

    1.  Representatives and staff from all ethnic minorities participate in the work of state organs at all levels, from the central to the local level. Ethnic groups practicing regional autonomy have a large number of personnel managing their own national autonomous area's state organs and affiliated enterprises and institutions. Other ethnic groups in the autonomous regions and Han people who come to the autonomous regions to help with work also have a group of personnel participating in the state organs and enterprise and institution work of the autonomous regions.

    2.  Individual farmers, herdsmen, handicraftsmen, and other laborers from all ethnic minorities and the Han ethnic group have organized many joint ethnic group cooperatives. Private industrialists and businessmen, small merchants, and unemployed people from all ethnic groups are organized separately in the same joint state-private stores and factories, or absorbed into the same state-owned enterprises.

    3.  Many factories, farms, and schools have been established in minority areas, railways and highways have been built, and various economic, cultural, and mass organizations have been established, absorbing a large number of workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and staff from all ethnic minorities and the Han ethnic group.

    4.  Immigration of Han people and other ethnic groups into minority areas has gradually increased.

    5.  Factories, schools, enterprises, and institutions in Han areas have paid special attention to recruiting ethnic minority personnel in order to train ethnic minority workers, technical cadres, and intellectuals.

    6.  Ethnic minority personnel and Han people simultaneously fulfill the rights and obligations of military service, and the People's Liberation Army has absorbed a large number of ethnic minority members.

    7.  Our Party has developed many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among ethnic minorities, and has cultivated a group of Party cadres and League cadres.

    Compared with the old society where ethnic minorities had no equal status and employment opportunities, where there were barriers between ethnic groups and little interaction, this is a completely new scene. The development of the socialist cause and socialist ethnic relations, and the development of the common labor and common life relationship among members of all ethnic groups, will inevitably lead to a phenomenon of mutual integration among ethnic groups due to the increasing proximity of members of different ethnic groups, the mutual acceptance of the influence of language, writing, customs, and cultural life in order to adapt to the new situation of ethnic relations. This is a natural and progressive trend that conforms to the laws of social development and the development of our society. It is beneficial to the development and progress of all ethnic groups in our country and to the strengthening of ethnic unity, and is by no means a bad tendency. Members of all ethnic groups should welcome the emergence and development of various new things, and should never oppose them. "The goal of socialism is not only to eliminate the phenomenon of humanity being divided into small countries and all the barriers between ethnic groups, not only to bring ethnic groups closer together, but also to integrate ethnic groups." (Lenin: "The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination")

    However, in this rectification movement, nationalists among ethnic minorities have raised the issue of opposing national assimilation, and have used this as an excuse to attack the Party, the motherland, and socialism. They propose that everything old in ethnic minorities should remain unchanged, that all systems of exploitation and oppression should not be changed, and that no ethnic characteristics or ethnic forms should be changed. They oppose mutual contact and influence between ethnic groups, the acceptance of new things, and any phenomenon of mutual integration between ethnic groups arising therefrom. They oppose all the work done by the Party and the state in ethnic minority areas (including the construction of large-scale industry, the construction of railways, and the training of the working class, intellectuals, and cadres), especially the socialist revolution and democratic reforms. They slander all this work and ethnic policies as assimilation policies, all of which are detrimental to ethnic minorities, believing that the Han ethnic group has assimilated ethnic minorities in history, and that the Han ethnic group's assistance to ethnic minorities and participation in production and work in ethnic minority areas are all for the purpose of assimilating ethnic minorities. They slander ethnic minority cadres who are loyal to the motherland, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the socialist cause, especially those who work and live well with Han cadres, or who can use Chinese language and writing, as being assimilated and betraying "ethnic interests." But from the reactionary fallacies of nationalists among ethnic minorities, it is not difficult to see that they do not hesitate to abandon patriotism to oppose the motherland, completely disregard ethnic interests to oppose the progress of their own ethnic group, and even oppose undertakings that are obviously beneficial to ethnic development and prosperity, such as developing large enterprises, building railways, and training intellectuals and revolutionary cadres in their own ethnic group (because these undertakings are connected to the socialist motherland). Therefore, they are the true opponents and betrayers of ethnic interests.

    A nation is a historical category. It has its own process of emergence and development, and eventually all nations will inevitably merge into a common whole. Mutual assimilation between nations arising from mutual contact and mutual influence has occurred since very early times, and the development and formation of modern nations themselves is a process of mutual integration under certain conditions. Without this process, it would be impossible to develop and form modern nations. However, the complete disappearance of differences between nations and the mutual integration of all nations into a common whole is a distant future event after the economic and cultural levels of all nations reach the same level and communism is realized. Now we have only achieved political equality between nations, and there is still an imbalance in the level of economic and cultural development between nations. Our task is still to help all nations reach a balance in the level of economic and cultural development, and this can only be achieved by working according to the different characteristics of each nation and fully taking into account national characteristics and national forms. To see the rapid development of the socialist cause and the universal formation of the relationship of common labor and common life among members of all ethnic groups, and therefore not only not to take care of national characteristics and national forms, but even to take advantage of this situation to try to eliminate national characteristics and national forms, is in essence a forced assimilation ideology. If this is done, it will not only be impossible to eliminate any national characteristics and national forms, but will instead cause suspicion and dissatisfaction among ethnic minorities, thus further hindering mutual contact and mutual influence between ethnic groups, as well as the acceptance of progressive things by ethnic minorities and the development of ethnic minority economies and cultures. There have been two types of assimilation in history. We have opposed the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' policy of forced assimilation of ethnic minorities, because that was the oppression of one nation by another. Opposing forced assimilation is opposing national oppression. But we do not oppose mutual contact and mutual influence between nations, mutual interaction and living together, and the phenomenon of mutual integration that naturally and gradually occurs as a result, because this is a natural and progressive trend in historical development, not national oppression. Lenin once said in discussing the assimilation of capitalism: "Whoever has not fallen into nationalistic prejudice cannot fail to see that this process of capitalist assimilation of nations contains a tremendous historical progressive role, and cannot fail to see the fact that national conservatism is being destroyed in every remote corner—especially in all backward countries like Russia." ("Critical Remarks on the National Question") It can be seen that it is by no means necessary to oppose any assimilation phenomenon. It must be seen that as long as society continues to develop forward and nations themselves continue to develop forward, the possibility of mutual contact and mutual influence between nations, as well as the possibility of mutual acceptance of each other's excellent traditions and advanced experiences, will only become greater and greater, the common things between nations will only become more and more, and the various differences between nations will gradually become smaller and smaller. This natural trend of social development is inevitable, cannot be stopped by anyone, and should not be stopped. Lenin said: "Any argument that advocates separating the workers of one nation from the workers of another nation, any attack on the 'assimilation idea' of Marxism, any act of opposing the culture of one nation as a whole to the culture of another nation, which seems to be a whole, in matters involving the proletariat, is a manifestation of bourgeois nationalist ideology and should be ruthlessly opposed." ("Critical Remarks on the National Question")

    National characteristics and national forms are what distinguish one nation from another, but it does not mean that all national characteristics and national forms are absolutely necessary and beneficial components for the forward development of a nation. Like any social phenomenon, national characteristics and national forms have excellent traditions, which are indispensable for promoting the forward development of the nation and the economic and cultural life of the people, and therefore must be promoted; but there are also outdated components that are useless to national development, to the socialist cause, and to the economic and cultural life of the people, which should not be promoted. With the improvement of the people's level of awareness and the promotion of national excellent traditions, naturally and without reluctance, gradually changing some outdated and useless components is extremely beneficial to the development of all ethnic groups. On the contrary, developing all national characteristics indiscriminately, and therefore also developing those outdated and useless components; or simply emphasizing the development of national forms, regardless of whether they are adapted to socialist content and detached from the socialist track, is obviously extremely detrimental, which in fact hinders the smooth forward development of all ethnic groups. The revolutionary and construction experience of other nations (especially the revolutionary and construction experience in the Han ethnic group for ethnic minorities) must definitely be learned and applied. It is wrong to refuse to learn and apply them, especially under the pretext that they are not original to one's own ethnic group, opposing the realization of socialist revolution and democratic reforms and socialist economic and cultural construction, which is extremely reactionary national conservatism and national isolationism. The historical facts of our country show that those nations that can often receive advanced and excellent components from other nations and constantly change outdated and useless components in their own nations are always more likely to achieve progress and development; and in ethnic minority areas where social development is relatively backward, there are more outdated and useless components that need to be changed, and there are more advanced and excellent components that can be accepted from other nations. All nations should learn from history. However, whether national characteristics and national forms are promoted or changed is entirely a matter for each nation itself, and any interference from other nations is wrong.

    All ethnic groups in our country have their own excellent historical traditions and rich cultural heritage. The historical traditions and cultural heritage of all ethnic groups must be respected, and should never be despised. The cultural heritage of every nation has components that are beneficial to the people, and it is necessary for all ethnic groups to respect and learn from each other. This is not only necessary for the development of the cultures of all ethnic groups, but also indispensable for making our motherland's culture richer and more prosperous. The various ethnic minorities in China, in their own development, have jointly created the historical culture of the great motherland together with the Han ethnic group, and have made great contributions to the founding of the motherland. Because the economy and culture of ethnic minorities are still more backward than those of the Han ethnic group, it is obviously wrong to obliterate the excellent historical traditions of hard work and long-term struggle that ethnic minorities also possess, and to describe the history of ethnic minorities as completely dark. However, it is also obviously wrong to regard the Han ethnic group's entry into ethnic minority areas in history, and the Han ethnic group's influence and assistance to ethnic minorities in economy and culture, as national oppression and forced assimilation, and to believe that they have only a destructive effect on the socio-economic development of ethnic minorities and have no positive significance. There have been times in Chinese history when certain ethnic minorities ruled the Han ethnic group, but more often it was the Han ethnic group that ruled various ethnic minorities. Due to the oppression of the Han ruling class, certain damage to the economy and culture of various ethnic minorities was caused in history, although this should not be the responsibility of the Han working people, especially not the responsibility of the current Han people, but without a doubt, this historical situation directly increases the Han ethnic group's unavoidable responsibility to help the economic and cultural development of various ethnic minorities now. Although there has been mutual oppression between ethnic groups in history, and even wars have occurred, the result of historical development is that economic ties, cultural exchanges, and mutual contact between ethnic groups have increased day by day, and relations of mutual assistance and cooperation have developed, and brotherly friendship has been established. The main aspect of ethnic relations in history is still that the Han ethnic group has helped the development of ethnic minorities in economic and cultural aspects, as well as mutual assistance and common development between ethnic groups, and through long-term unity and struggle, has jointly achieved the great victory of building a family of the motherland and the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Therefore, the history of the motherland, including all ethnic groups, and the ethnic relations in history should be correctly understood, and used to inspire the will and enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups to unite and work hard to build socialism, and to educate the people of all ethnic groups to further strengthen the equal, united, mutual assistance, and cooperative relations between all brotherly ethnic groups, and to forever consolidate the unified unity of the family of all ethnic groups in the motherland.

    关于“民族同化”问题
    刘春
    国内社会主义的民族关系的发展，不仅一般地表现为祖国社会主义大家庭中国家和各个民族之间以及各个兄弟民族之间的统一、团结、平等、互助、共同发展、共同繁荣的关系，并且愈来愈多地、愈来愈普遍地表现为合作社、工厂、企业、学校、军队、国家机关、党的机关、团的机关和群众团体中各民族的成员之间共同劳动、共同生活的兄弟和同志关系。这表现在：
    1、各少数民族都有代表和工作人员参加从中央到地方各级国家机关的工作，实行区域自治的民族有大批人员自己管理民族自治地方的国家机关和所属企业、事业，自治地方的其他民族和到自治地方帮助工作的汉族也有一批人员参加自治地方的国家机关和企业、事业的工作。
    2、各少数民族和汉族的个体农民、牧民、手工业者和其他劳动人民组织了很多民族联合社，各民族的私营工商业者、小商贩和失业人员分别组织在同一公私合营商店和工厂中，或者分别吸收参加到同一国营企业中。
    3、少数民族地区开办了许多工厂、农场、学校，修筑了铁路、公路，建立了各种经济、文化机构和各种群众团体，大量吸收了各少数民族的和汉族的工人、农民、学生、知识分子和工作人员。
    4、少数民族地区逐渐增加了汉族和其他民族的移民。
    5、汉族地区的工厂、学校、企业、事业机构中，为了培养少数民族工人、技术干部和知识分子，特别注意吸收了少数民族人员。
    6、少数民族人员和汉族同时履行服兵役的权利和义务，人民解放军吸收了大量少数民族成员。
    7、我们党在少数民族中发展了很多共产党员和共青团员，培养了一批党员干部和团员干部。
    和旧社会少数民族没有平等地位和就业机会、各民族间存在着隔阂、互相来往不多的情况相比，这完全是一种新的景象。社会主义事业和社会主义民族关系的发展，各民族成员之间共同劳动共同生活关系的发展，势必由于不同民族成员的日益接近，导致各民族成员之间为了互相适应民族关系的新情况，彼此互相接受语言、文字、风俗习惯、文化生活的影响，产生民族间某种互相融合的现象，这是符合社会发展规律以及我国社会发展情况的一种自然的进步的趋势，对于我国各民族的发展和进步，对民族团结的加强都是有利的，决不是不好的倾向。各民族的成员都应该欢迎各种新事物的出现和发展，决不应该加以反对。“社会主义的目的，不但是要消灭人类之分散为各小国的现象及各民族的一切间隔，不但是要使各民族接近起来，而且要使各民族融合起来。”（列宁：“社会主义革命与民族自决权”）
    但是在这次整风运动中，少数民族中的民族主义者提出了反对民族同化的问题，并且以此作为借口向党向祖国向社会主义进行攻击。他们提出少数民族旧有的一切都应该原封不动，一切剥削压迫制度不能改变，任何民族特点、民族形式都不能改变。他们反对各民族互相接近、互相影响和接受新事物以及由此产生的民族间任何互相溶合的现象，反对党和国家在少数民族地区进行的一切工作（包括建设大工业、修铁路、培养工人阶级、知识分子和干部等），特别反对社会主义革命和民主改革。他们污蔑所有这些工作和民族政策都是同化政策，都不利于少数民族，认为汉族在历史上是同化少数民族的，现在汉族对少数民族的帮助和到少数民族地区去参加生产和工作都是为了同化少数民族。他们污蔑忠实于祖国、忠实于党和忠实于社会主义事业的本民族干部，特别是和汉族干部共事共处得很好的，或能够使用汉语汉文的干部是被同化了，是背叛“民族利益”。但是从少数民族中的民族主义者的反动谬论中，不难看出他们不惜抛弃爱国主义来反对祖国，完全不顾民族利益来反对自己的民族向前进步，甚至连在自己民族中发展大企业、修铁路以及培养知识分子和革命干部等显然有利于民族发展和繁荣的事业也反对（因为这些事业都和社会主义祖国相连）。因此他们才是民族利益的真正反对者和背叛者。
    民族是一个历史范畴，它有自己的发生和发展过程，各民族最后必定会互相溶合成为一个共同的整体，民族之间由于互相接近和互相影响所产生的互相同化，在很早以来就发生了，并且现代民族的发展和形成本身也是人们在一定的条件下互相溶合的过程，没有这个过程，不可能发展和形成为现代民族。但是民族间的差别完全消失，各民族互相溶合成为一个共同的整体，还是各民族的经济、文化达到相同的水平和共产主义实现了以后的遥远将来的事。现在我们还只实现了各民族间政治上的平等，还存在各民族间经济、文化发展水平的不平衡，我们的任务仍然是要帮助各民族在经济、文化的发展水平达到平衡，而这是只有在根据各民族不同的特点和充分照顾民族特点、民族形式的情况下进行工作才能够实现的。看到社会主义事业迅速发展和各民族成员共同劳动共同生活的关系普遍形成，因而不仅不去照顾民族特点和民族形式，甚至还借此形势设法去消灭民族特点和民族形式的思想，实质上就是强制同化思想。如果这样作，不仅不可能消灭什么民族特点和民族形式，反而会引起少数民族中的怀疑和不满，因而更阻碍了各民族间的互相接近和互相影响，以及少数民族对进步事物的接受和少数民族经济、文化的发展。历史上曾经有两种同化。我们曾经反对过国民党反动统治者对少数民族的强制同化政策，因为那是一个民族对另一个民族的压迫，反对强制同化就是反对民族压迫。但是我们并不反对民族间的互相接近和互相影响，互相来往和共同居住生活在一起，以及由此自然地逐渐地发生的互相溶合的现象，因为这是历史发展中自然的进步的趋势，并不是民族压迫。列宁在论及资本主义的同化的时候就曾经说过：“谁没有陷入民族主义的偏见，谁就不能不看出资本主义同化民族的这一过程包含有极大的历史进步作用，谁就不能不看出各个偏僻角落——特别是在一切像俄国这样落后的国家中——民族保守状态破坏的事实。”（“关于民族问题的批评意见”）可见决不能对任何同化现象都加以反对。必须看到，只要社会继续向前发展，各民族自己也继续向前发展，各民族间的互相接近和互相影响的可能，以及互相接受彼此之间的优良传统和先进经验的可能只会愈来愈大，民族之间共同的东西只会愈来愈多，民族之间的种种差别也会逐渐小一些和逐渐少一些。这种社会发展的自然趋势是不可避免的，不是任何人能够阻止的，并且也不应该加以阻止。列宁说：“任何一种鼓吹把一个民族的工人与另一民族的工人分开的论调，任何一种对马克思主义的‘同化思想’进行攻击的言论，任何一种在涉及无产阶级的问题上把一个民族文化当作整个东西来与另一个似乎是整个东西的民族文化对立的行为，都是资产阶级民族主义思想的表现，都是应该受到无情反对的。”（“关于民族问题的批评意见”）
    民族特点和民族形式是表明一个民族和另一个民族之间的差别，并不是表明所有的民族特点和民族形式都是民族向前发展所绝对必需的和有益的成分。和任何社会现象一样，民族特点和民族形式中有优良的传统，这是促进民族向前发展和人民的经济、文化生活所不可缺少的，因而必须发扬；但是也有过时的、对民族发展、对社会主义事业和对人民的经济文化生活无益的成分，这是不应该发扬的。随着人民觉悟水平的提高和民族优良传统的发扬，自然地毫不勉强地逐渐去改变一些过时的无益的成分，对各民族的发展是极为有利的。相反的，无区别地发展一切民族特点，因而也发展那些过时的无益的成分；或者单纯强调发展民族形式，不论它是否适应社会主义内容和脱离社会主义轨道，显然是极为不利的，这实际上妨碍了各民族顺利地向前发展。其他民族的革命和建设经验（对少数民族来说特别是汉族中的革命和建设的经验），肯定地说必须学习和运用，拒绝学习和运用是错误的，特别是借口不是本民族原有的东西，反对实现社会主义革命和民主改革以及社会主义经济、文化建设，更是极端反动的民族保守主义和民族孤立主义。我国的历史事实说明：凡是能够常常接收其他民族中先进的优良的成分，不断改变自己民族中过时的无益的成分的，总是更能获得进步和发展的民族；并且社会发展比较落后的民族地区，过时的无益的因而有必要改变的成分更多些，可以从其他民族接受的先进的优良的成分也更多些。任何民族都应该从历史吸取经验。但是民族特点和民族形式的发扬或改变与否，完全是各民族自己的事情，来自其他民族中的任何干涉都是错误的。
    我国各民族都有着自己优秀的历史传统和丰富的文化遗产。对于各民族的历史传统和文化遗产必须互相尊重，决不应该互相轻视。每一个民族的文化遗产中都有有益于人民的成分，各民族彼此互相尊重、互相学习是必须的。这不仅对于发展各民族的文化有必要，而且是使我们祖国的文化更加丰富和繁荣所不可缺少的。中国各少数民族在自己的发展中，和汉族一起共同创造了伟大祖国的历史文化，对祖国的缔造有很大贡献。由于少数民族的经济文化现在还比汉族落后，因而抹杀少数民族同样具有辛勤劳动和长期奋斗的优良历史传统，把少数民族的历史说成是漆黑一团，显然是错误的。但是把历史上汉族进到少数民族地区去，和汉族在经济文化上对少数民族的影响和帮助，都看成是民族压迫和强制同化，认为对少数民族社会经济发展只有破坏作用，没有任何积极意义，也显然是错误的。中国历史上有过某些少数民族统治汉族的时候，但是更多的时候是汉族统治各个少数民族。由于汉族统治阶级的压迫，在历史上对各少数民族造成了经济、文化的某种破坏，虽然这是不应该由汉族劳动人民负责，特别不应该由现在的汉族人民来负责的，但是毫无疑义，这种历史情况直接加重了现在汉族帮助各少数民族经济、文化发展的不可推卸的责任。历史上各民族间虽然发生过互相压迫，甚至发生过战争，但是历史发展的结果，各民族间还是日益增多了经济联系、文化交流和互相接近，还是发展了互助合作的关系，建立了兄弟的友谊。历史上民族关系的主要方面，还是汉族帮助了少数民族在经济、文化方面的发展以及各民族之间的互相帮助和共同发展，并且经过长期团结奋斗，共同取得建成祖国大家庭以及民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利。因此应该正确地理解包括各民族在内的祖国历史和历史上的民族关系，并且用来鼓舞各民族人民团结、努力建设社会主义的意志和热情，教育各民族人民更加增强各兄弟民族之间的平等、团结、互助、合作关系，永远巩固祖国各民族大家庭的统一团结。
