The Whole Story of the Macheng County Party Secretary Cultivating Experimental Plots

Last year, the secretaries of the Macheng County Party Committee all cultivated experimental plots, and many cadres at all levels also cultivated them. Cultivating experimental plots to participate in production and lead production, and to promote various new cultivation techniques, is one of the main reasons why the county achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton last year. Why can cadres cultivating experimental plots play such a big role? To answer this question, I recently visited Zhao Jinliang, the secretary of the County Party Committee. His introduction of his experience in cultivating experimental plots profoundly and vividly illustrates the superiority of this leadership method.

Selected a "Backward Field" for Experimentation

Among the County Party Committee secretaries, Zhao Jinliang was responsible for leading cotton production. He started cultivating experimental plots later than most cadres. This is because: cadres cultivating experimental plots is a completely new job, and it is not easy to get the majority of cadres to accept it, so systematic education and arrangements must be carried out; at that time, the County Party Committee decided that he would be responsible for these tasks in the county, and the other secretaries would go down first to take the lead. By the time he had arranged these tasks, it was already the end of May.

In early June, Zhao Jinliang went to Lisheng Township, which is dozens of kilometers away from the county seat. This is a township that mainly produces cotton. At that time, the cotton seedlings had been unearthed for a long time, but some grew well and some grew poorly. Which cotton field should be selected as his experimental field? Zhao Jinliang thought: if the seedlings that grow well are selected, the masses will not be convinced when there is a bumper harvest in the future, so he decided to select a field with poorly grown seedlings. As a result, he found a cotton field of more than one mu in the 14th production team of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative to serve as his experimental field. This field was a backward field in the whole township at that time, with uneven seedlings and yellow and thin plants.

Although Zhao Jinliang has been engaged in rural work for a long time, he is not very familiar with cotton production. After he took over the backward cotton field, he was not clear about how to change its original appearance and catch up with and surpass the advanced fields, but he believed that diligent cultivation could gradually transform it.

Identify the Reasons, Come Up with Solutions, and Dare to Try

But things are not that simple. After he put up the sign for the experimental field, he had individually top-dressed those backward cotton seedlings, and paid close attention to keeping the field free of weeds. Although this made the seedlings more uniform, the seedlings in the whole field still grew very slowly, and compared with those fields with good seedlings, it looked worse and worse. What is the reason for this? He had talked to the people in the team. But no one could figure it out, they just said that the field was not good in the first place. This made Zhao Jinliang both anxious and distressed. Later, he decided to discuss with Han Guangdou, the head of the technical section of the County Agriculture Bureau, to see what the problem was.

Han Guangdou came. They went to the field together, studied the growth of the cotton seedlings, and analyzed the soil. Finally, Han Guangdou believed that the reason why the seedlings did not grow was because the soil in this field was too hard, and the roots of the cotton seedlings could not extend downwards, thus affecting growth. He believed that the solution to this problem was to carry out intertillage, loosening the soil, and deep plowing to a depth of five inches. When Zhao Jinliang heard him say this, he felt that it made sense, so he decided to use a three-pronged cultivator to intertill and loosen the soil. Han Guangdou also participated in the operation. This experimental field happened to be on the side of the road, and there were originally many people coming and going. When people heard that the County Party Secretary had decided to use intertillage and loosening the soil to help the seedlings grow, they rushed to watch.

It is difficult to reach a depth of five inches with a three-pronged cultivator for intertillage. So Zhao Jinliang had to adopt this method: first use it to plow about three inches deep, and then use an ordinary hoe to dig. In this way, they plowed and dug between the rows of cotton, finishing one row and then doing the second row. Some of the onlookers expressed doubts about their methods; those with serious conservative ideas even watched and laughed, saying sarcastic remarks: "This is not leading production, it is simply destroying production!" "Anyway, they are doing experiments, and they don't have to pay for the reduced production, so what are they afraid of!" Others, worried that this would really reduce production, came to persuade them not to do this. After so many people spoke and persuaded, Zhao Jinliang himself was a little worried, but he had no other way, so he decided to persevere. He thought: "Even if it fails, we can learn a lesson!" At the same time, he also declared to everyone: "If my experimental field reduces production, I will compensate for the loss."

This work was done one morning in July. By the afternoon, the cotton seedlings slowly lowered their heads. This was because some root hairs were broken during intertillage. At that time, Zhao Jinliang had asked Han Guangdou whether this would affect the growth of the cotton seedlings. Han Guangdou said: "It doesn't matter, it will change quickly." However, the masses did not know this principle and thought that something was really wrong. So, those who had made sarcastic remarks earlier felt even more that they were "right" at this time; some of the masses and cadres who were concerned about this experiment automatically went to fetch water to help them water, hoping to make the lowered seedlings raise their heads again through watering. Zhao Jinliang, who already knew why the cotton seedlings were lowering their heads, went to dissuade them after seeing this situation, telling them that this was not due to a lack of water and that it would naturally improve in a few days.

Sure enough, the next morning, when Zhao Jinliang came to the field to see, he found that the cotton seedlings were no longer the same as yesterday. After that, the cotton seedlings grew very quickly, like people who had just recovered from illness, growing an average of about one inch per day, and catching up with the seedlings in those advanced fields in five or six days. This incident caused a sensation in the whole township, and people everywhere spread the word: "Secretary Zhao's cotton has changed!" "I didn't expect intertillage and loosening the soil to have such a big effect!"

Organize Visits and Comparisons, and Teach Techniques on the Spot

Also at this time, Zhao Jinliang discovered that some farmers nearby were secretly going to see the experimental field and doing the same thing. He thought, everyone should come and see. So, he first gathered the cadres of Lisheng Township and the surrounding masses, and told them why intertillage was needed and how to intertill while letting them visit. Then, he held a forum with them on the spot, asked them to raise questions, and discussed with them whether this method could be promoted throughout the township. Facts are the most convincing. In this township, everyone knew what the experimental field was like before. After seeing and comparing, they all said, "This is good, we will do the same when we go back!" In just three days, more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields in the township had been intertilled, and the old habit of not intertilling that had been passed down in history was thus broken. Seeing this effect, Zhao Jinliang also brought the cadres and representatives of agricultural cooperatives from the cotton-producing areas of the whole county to see, and also used methods such as visits, comparisons, and discussions to quickly solve everyone's ideological problems. When these people returned to their respective townships and cooperatives, this technology was also widely promoted throughout the county.

This is the first role played by Zhao Jinliang's experimental field. He recalled that if it were not for cultivating experimental plots, the technique of intertillage and loosening the soil would not have been promoted throughout the county, and it would not even have been discovered that not intertilling cotton fields would affect the growth of cotton seedlings. From this practice, Zhao Jinliang drew the following experience: only by cultivating experimental plots can we promote cadres to truly study technology; only by cooperating well with technical cadres can we penetrate technology more thoroughly; and to make the role of experimental plots fully play out, we must consciously organize visits, comparisons, and organize discussions and teach techniques on the spot. So, from then on, he and Han Guangdou experimented together, and every time they successfully tried or created a new technology, they adopted the above methods to promote it. He described this method of promotion as: "Graduating in five minutes, deep and thorough."

In the entire cotton seedling growth process that followed, Zhao Jinliang and Han Guangdou successfully adopted a series of important measures in the experimental field, such as striving for more fruit branches, preserving flowers, and preserving bolls. For example, they implemented topdressing during the flowering period and adopted the methods of "strip application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers" and "sending the fertilizer to the cotton seedlings' mouths" (that is, digging four-inch-deep pits near the roots and then applying the fertilizer in the pits) to apply topdressing. Topdressing during the flowering period and applying topdressing in this way were also unprecedented in Macheng County, but this is an important link in preserving buds, preserving flowers, and preserving bolls. For example, they also implemented timely pruning, side topping, and wiping off redundant buds to ensure that there was ventilation and light between rows and between plants, so as to control the growth of cotton, so as to protect the lower bolls and consolidate the middle bolls. These measures were also promoted throughout the county through on-site visits, comparisons, and on-the-spot technology transfer, which was of great significance for promoting the bumper harvest of cotton throughout the county.

Experiment with Old Farmers

Zhao Jinliang believes that to cultivate experimental plots well, in addition to combining with technical personnel, it is also necessary to combine with the masses, that is, on the one hand, we must pay attention to adopting the inherent advanced experience of the masses, and at the same time, it is best to find a few people to work together when cultivating. He believes that after doing this, it will promote the masses to care about the experimental field, cherish the experimental field, and at the same time, they can learn specific operation techniques from the masses at any time. He once told me this: When the cotton in the experimental field began to bear bolls, he returned to the county because he had something to do. One day, He Yuankui, the secretary of the township branch, told him on the phone that several elderly farmers in the township took the initiative to suggest that they should "chase boll fertilizer" (that is, apply topdressing when bearing bolls) in the experimental field, and at the same time hit the main top, saying that this could promote more bolls on the upper part. After receiving the call, he immediately rushed back to the township and followed this suggestion, and the effect was very good. This is a very valuable experience. Someone in the township had done this before, but it was not promoted throughout the township. And this practice is said to be not found in books on cotton planting, so agricultural technician Han Guangdou did not know about it. Later, this experience was also promoted throughout the county.

Zhao Jinliang's experimental field completely changed its original appearance and played a significant role in promoting cotton production throughout the county. When harvesting cotton, one-third of the cotton plants in this original backward field had 20 layers of fruit branches per plant, and the cotton bolls were large and abundant from top to bottom. The entire experimental field averaged 600 jin of seed cotton per mu, which was more than 30% higher than the average yield of Lisheng Township, the township with the highest cotton yield in the county.

Now, the masses in Lisheng Township are very interested in experimental plots and generally say: "Using this method to lead production, who is still ideologically blocked?"

    麻城县委书记种试验田的始末
    新华社记者　方堤
    去年，中共麻城县委的书记们个个都种了试验田，各级干部种试验田的也很多。通过种试验田来参加生产和领导生产，推广各种新的耕作技术，是这个县在去年获得粮、棉大丰收的主要原因之一。干部种试验田为什么能起到这样大的作用呢？为了回答这个问题，我最近访问了县委书记赵金良。他介绍自己种试验田的经过情形，深刻而又生动地说明了这种领导方法的优越性。
    选了一块“落后田”来试验
    在县委书记中，赵金良是负责领导棉花生产的。他开始种试验田的时间比一般干部要晚一些。这是因为：干部种试验田是一件全新的工作，要使广大干部接受它，不是一件容易的事，必须进行系统的教育和安排；当时县委决定由他在县里负责这些工作，其他的书记们先下去带头搞。当他把这些工作安排就绪时，已是5月末了。
    6月初，赵金良到了离县城几十公里的李胜乡。这是一个主要生产棉花的乡。那时，棉花的苗儿出土好久了，但有的长得好，有的长得差。选那块棉田来作自己的试验田呢？赵金良想：如果选苗长得好的，将来丰产了群众也是不服气的，便决定选一块苗长得差的。结果，他在红星农业社十四生产队里找了块一亩多的棉田来作自己的试验田。这块田在当时是全乡的落后田，苗出得不齐，而且又黄又瘦。
    赵金良虽然长期搞农村工作，但对棉花生产却很不熟悉。当他把那块落后的棉田接受下来后，究竟怎样才能使它改变原来面目，赶上并超过那些先进田，开始是不明确的，但他相信，勤耕细作可以使它慢慢地转变过来。
    看准原因，想出办法，大胆试行
    可是事情并不那样简单。当他把试验田的牌子插下后，就曾对那些落后的棉苗进行过个别追肥，又很注意不让田里有杂草。这样作虽然使苗整齐了些，但整块田的苗却仍然长得很慢，与那些苗长得好的田比起来，眼看是越来越差得远了。这究竟是什么原因呢？他和队里的人谈过。可是大家也谈不出所以然来，只是说这块田本来就不好。这使得赵金良又着急又苦恼。后来，他才决定和县农业局的技术股长韩光斗商量，看看毛病到底在那里。
    韩光斗来了。他们一起到田里去，研究了棉苗的生长情况，又对土壤进行了分析。最后，韩光斗认为苗不长的原因，是因为这块田的土壤太板结，棉苗的根不能伸到下面去，因而影响生长。他认为解决这个问题的办法是进行中耕、松土，并且要深耕到五寸。赵金良听他这样一说，觉得有道理，就决定用三齿耘锄来中耕、松土。韩光斗也参加了操作。这块试验田正好是在大路边，来往的人本来就较多。当人们听说县委书记决定用中耕、松土的办法来助苗生长时，就纷纷跑来观看。
    用三齿耘锄中耕，要达到五寸深是困难的。所以赵金良只得采用这样的办法：先用它耕约三寸深后，再用普通的锄来挖。就这样，他们在棉行间耕了又挖，一行作完又作第二行。旁边观看的群众，对他们的作法有的表示怀疑；保守思想严重的人，甚至边看边笑，大说风凉话：“这那里是领导生产，简直是破坏生产！”“反正人家是作试验的，减了产又不赔，怕啥！”另一些人，耽心这样作真会减产，就来劝他们不要这样搞。经这样多人又说又劝，赵金良自己也有些不大放心，但又没有别的法子，还是决定坚持下去。他想：“就是失败了，也可得到教训嘛！”同时，他还向大家声明说：“如果我的试验田减了产，损失多少就赔多少。”
    这些工作是在7月间的一天上午作的。到下午，棉苗慢慢地低下头来。这是因为中耕时搞断了一些根须造成的。当时赵金良曾问过韩光斗，这对棉苗的生长是否会影响。韩光斗说：“没有关系，很快就会变过来的。”可是，群众不知道这个道理，以为是真的坏了事。于是，先前那些说风凉话的人，这时更觉得自己“有理”了；有些群众和关心这一试验的干部，就自动去挑水帮他们浇，想通过浇水使低头的苗儿又昂起头来。已经知道棉苗为什么要低头的赵金良看到这种情况后，就去劝阻他们，告诉他们这不是缺水的关系，过两天自然会好转。
    果然，到第二天清早，当赵金良一起来到田里去看时，就发现棉苗已经不是昨天那个样子了。这以后，棉苗像刚消除了病患的人一样，长得很快，平均每天要长一寸左右，五、六天就赶上了那些先进田的苗。这件事轰动了全乡，人们到处纷纷传说：“赵书记的棉花变了哩！”“想不到中耕、松土有这大作用！”
    组织参观、评比，就地传授技术
    也是这个时候，赵金良发现附近有些农民偷偷地去看试验田，并且照样干了起来。他想，得让大家都来看看。于是，他先把李胜乡的干部和周围的群众找来，一面让他们参观，一面告诉他们为什么要中耕和如何中耕。然后，又和他们一起在现场开座谈会，要他们提问题，并同他们讨论能否把这个办法在全乡推广。事实是最能说服人的。在这个乡，谁都知道那块试验田原先是什么样子，经这么一看一比，都说“这样好，回去就照办！”仅仅三天，全乡五千多亩棉田都进行了中耕，历史上流传下来的不中耕的旧习惯，就这样被打破。看到这种效果后，赵金良又把全县各棉产区的干部和农业社的代表找来看，也是用参观、评比、讨论等方法，很快就解决了大家的思想问题。当这些人回到各乡、各社后，这项技术在全县也随着普遍地推广起来。
    这就是赵金良的试验田第一次发挥的作用。他回忆说，要不是种试验田，中耕、松土这一技术不说在全县范围内推广，甚至根本就不会发现棉田不中耕是会影响棉苗生长的。从这次实践中，赵金良得出了如下经验：只有种试验田，才能促使干部真正地钻研技术；只有和技术干部很好合作，才能把技术钻得比较透；而要使试验田的作用得到充分的发挥，还得有意识地组织参观、评比，就地组织讨论和传授技术。于是，从这以后，他就同韩光斗一起试验，每试行成功或创造出什么新技术时，都采用上述办法来推广。他形容这种推广的方法是：“五分钟毕业，又深又透。”
    在以后的整个棉苗成长过程中，赵金良和韩光斗一起曾在试验田里成功地采用了争取多长果枝、保花、保桃等一系列重要措施。例如他们曾实行花期追肥，并且采用了“氮磷钾肥混合条施”和“把肥料送到棉苗口边”（即在根附近挖四寸深的坑，再把肥料追在坑内）的办法来施追肥。花期追肥和用这种办法追肥，在麻城县也是史无前例的，但这却是保蕾、保花、保桃的重要环节。又如，他们还曾实行过适时整枝、打旁顶、抹赘芽等技术措施，使行与行、棵与棵之间既能通风又能通光，这样来控制棉花的生长，以保护下部桃和巩固中部桃。这些措施，也都通过现场参观、评比和就地传授技术的方法，在全县推广，对促使全县棉花丰产意义很大。
    同老农一起试验
    赵金良认为，种好试验田，除了和技术人员结合外，还得和群众结合，即一方面要注意采用群众固有的先进经验，同时在耕作时最好也能找几个群众一起来搞。他认为这样作以后，会促使群众关心试验田，爱护试验田，同时也可以随时向群众学习具体的操作技术。他曾告诉我这样一件事：试验田的棉花开始结桃时，他因为有事回到县里。一天，乡支部书记何原魁在电话里对他说，乡里有几个老年农民主动建议要在试验田里“追桃肥”（即在结桃时追肥），并且同时打正顶，说这样可以促使上部多结桃。他接到电话后，立即赶回乡里，照这个意见办了，效果很好。这是很可贵的经验，过去乡里有人曾这样作过，但并未在全乡推广。而这种作法据说在植棉的书上也是没有的，农业技术干部韩光斗因此也不知道。以后，这项经验也向全县推广了。
    赵金良的试验田就这样完全改变了原来的面貌，在推进全县棉花生产中起了重大作用。到收摘棉花时，这块原来的落后田有三分之一的棉树每株有二十层果枝，从上到下棉桃结得又多又大。整个试验田每亩平均产籽棉达到六百斤，比所在的李胜乡——全县棉产量最高的乡的平均产量还高出30％以上。
    现在，李胜乡的群众对试验田很感兴趣，普遍反映说：“用这种办法来领导生产，那个还思想不通呢？”
