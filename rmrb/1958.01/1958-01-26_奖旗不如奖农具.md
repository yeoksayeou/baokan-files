    Awarding Pennants Is Not As Good As Awarding Farm Tools

    When I walked into the office of the Beilizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Pingxiang County, Hebei Province, several cooperative cadres were arguing about the issue of awarding pennants. The accountant said, "Just watch, the county will award many pennants at this model meeting!" Another person chimed in, "The higher-ups only know how to make and issue award pennants, wasting cloth and money. Awarding them to agricultural cooperatives doesn't help much." The third production team leader said bluntly, "If I had to choose between an award pennant and a sickle, I'd take the sickle over the pennant." The second production team leader said, "Our cooperative doesn't have many yet, but you haven't seen the big room in the township government; the walls are covered with award pennants. The higher-ups are calling for saving cloth, so why are they wasting so much cloth? We must raise an objection." After listening to this discussion, I felt it made a lot of sense.

    Last December, Pingxiang County held a commendation meeting for model workers, awarding a total of thirty-eight pennants to various model units and individuals. Calculating three feet of cloth per pennant, this required a hundred and fourteen feet of cloth, costing a hundred and ninety yuan in labor and materials. This is just one county at one meeting; if it were the whole province or the whole country, the figures would be astonishing. If this money were used to buy farm tools to award to each model, the value would be much greater.

    Giving banners to model workers as a reward is a noble honor. However, regardless of the size of the achievements, it's always "one banner," which is not only a waste but also trivializes the banners. The argument among the cadres of the Beilizhuang Agricultural Cooperative is an example of this.

    Now is the peak season for evaluating achievements and commending models. I believe awarding farm tools is better than awarding pennants. Liang Gan

    奖旗不如奖农具
    当我走进河北省平乡县北李庄农业社办公室的时候，几个社干部正在争论着奖旗的问题。会计说：“你们看着，县里在这次表模会上要奖多少旗吧！”另一个人插着说：“上级光知道制发奖旗，遭踏了布，又浪费了钱，奖给农业社也顶不了啥事。”第三生产队长直接了当的说：“若有一面奖旗和一把镰刀让我拣，我要镰刀也不要奖旗。”第二生产队长说：“咱社还不多，你们没见乡政府的大屋里呢，墙上都挂满了奖旗。上级号召节约布，为啥还浪费这些布呢？可得提个意见。”我听了这番争论觉得满有道理。
    去年12月份平乡县召开了一次评功表模会，奖给各模范单位和个人的奖旗共三十八面，按每面用布三尺计算，就得用布一百一十四尺，工本费一百九十元。这仅一个县一个会，如果是全省全国的话，那数字是很惊人的。如果把这些钱买成农具奖给每个模范，其价值是大得多的。
    对模范者给以锦旗的奖励，是一种崇高的荣誉。但是不分事迹的大小，动不动就是“锦旗一面”，这不但是一种浪费，同时把锦旗也庸俗化了。如北李庄农业社干部们的争论就是一个例子。
    现在正是评功表模的旺季，我认为奖旗不如奖农具。　良干
