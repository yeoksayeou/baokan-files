The Three Fairies
Worker at Shijingshan Power Plant, Yan Yizhong

Last spring, the young people in the factory often talked about the "Three Fairies" behind my back. When I asked what the Three Fairies were all about, whoever I asked would wink at me and grin. The more they wouldn't tell me, the more I wanted to know this secret. One day, I grabbed a young fellow and insisted that he tell me what the Three Fairies were, and I wouldn't let him go until he did. As luck would have it, he cunningly pursed his lips and whispered, "Aren't the Three Fairies coming?" I looked in the direction he was pointing, and I suddenly understood; it turned out that "Three Fairies" was a collective nickname.

Coming towards us were three girls, all from our workshop. One was Li Xiuzhen, one was Sun Min, and one was Zhang Li. The three of them were walking side by side, talking and laughing. Li Xiuzhen was wearing a red sweater with small pink flowers embroidered on the chest, Sun Min was wearing a green sweater, and Zhang Li was wearing a yellow sweater with a red-flower-patterned collar. Below, they all had bright skirts. Their half-high-heeled leather shoes made crisp "click," "click" sounds on the cement road. No wonder everyone called them the Three Fairies; they were walking leisurely among people wearing work clothes, which was quite eye-catching.

In the summer, the situation became even more serious. The four newly arrived female apprentices who had graduated from junior high school began to imitate the Three Fairies, developing into Seven Fairies. The mischievous young men discussed them in private.

Xiao Zhang told me, "Yan Yizhong, Li Xiuzhen spent seventeen yuan to make a vest, and Zhang Li bought three pairs of leather shoes this month."

I asked, "Is production going well?" Xiao Zhang curled his lips and said, "Humph! How could it be? None of them want to do hard work. Sun Min is a technician who sits in the laboratory reading all day long, never coming out. She spends six hours of her eight-hour shift reading. I don't ask her to do anything, and it's more of a burden to lead them."

The rectification began, but the Three Fairies rarely participated in activities or debates, as if the wind couldn't touch them, which made me feel even heavier. Later, when the Party Central Committee proposed the nationwide rectification movement, they reluctantly participated.

At a group meeting at the end of September, veteran worker Yao Fu said, "The young people these days are too outrageous. They don't like to do this, they don't like to do that, always picking and choosing. In the future, when new people come, they should first be sent to push coal for three years to reform themselves."

After Master Yao proposed this excellent method, the young people murmured among themselves for a while. Some muttered their dissatisfaction, but no one came out to refute it. Just then, Li Xiuzhen adjusted herself, scanned the young people at the meeting, and said, "I disagree with Master Yao's statement. This is limiting the future of young people. What is there to learn from pushing coal? It's unnecessary." After she finished speaking, Master Yao lit a cigarette and frowned as he smoked.

The young people became active after listening to Li Xiuzhen's speech. Li Xiuzhen continued, "I think the veteran workers are upset that we young people are being promoted too quickly, and it's wrong to ask us to push coal!" This touched Master Yao, who leaned forward slightly and said excitedly to Li Xiuzhen, "Let everyone hear what you're saying, Xiuzhen. Have you forgotten picking coal nuggets when you were a child?" When Li Xiuzhen heard Master Yao reveal her past, her face turned red to the roots of her ears, then turned from red to pale.

The next day, I heard Zhang Li say that Li Xiuzhen was crying with her eyes red, wearing a mask all day, and ignoring everyone she saw. At dusk, when she saw me, she walked past with her head down. I knew she didn't want to recall the past days, let alone let others know about her past life. I clearly remembered that before liberation, Aunt Li led me and Li Xiuzhen to the factory to pick coal nuggets. Once, her hand was burned by a red coal block, and there is still a small scar on her hand. At that time, she was a little girl carrying a broken bamboo basket and wearing ragged clothes. I really wanted to chat with her, but time didn't allow me to fulfill my wish. Not two days later, Li Xiuzhen joined a delegation to visit the countryside and went to the Taihang Mountains.

One evening in late October, after dinner, I went to Zhang Li's dormitory to learn about her and Sun Min's experiences visiting the Jingxi Coal Mine, and their thoughts on visiting small, jointly-operated public-private factories in the city. From a long distance away from Zhang Li's dormitory, I could hear the noise coming from the room. Familiar voices told me that there was more than one person in the room. Sure enough, in addition to Zhang Li, there were Sun Min and Li Xiuzhen. The three of them were vying to talk about their experiences. They greeted me and then started arguing again. I jokingly asked, "Are you three sisters arguing about whose fabric is better again? Come on, let me be the judge; my conclusion will be fair." Sun Min said unhappily, "You're always jumping to conclusions; it's none of your business. You just listen carefully; Li Xiuzhen is talking about things in the countryside."

Li Xiuzhen continued, "Don't think that the farmers' lives are hard, but they have a spirit of hard work. They want to increase production next year and hand over more grain to the state, and hand over the best, fullest grain." I asked, "What's so hard about it?" Li Xiuzhen said, "A county magistrate only earns ninety yuan a month. He fought in the guerrilla war and is still a veteran cadre. The farmers are even worse off." I asked again, "Compared to whom?" Li Xiuzhen thought for a moment and said, "Compared to me! I get eighty or ninety yuan a month, which is about the same as a county magistrate." I asked again, "Why do they still have the drive?" Li Xiuzhen immediately said, "Now there's enough to eat, enough to drink, houses to live in, and clothes to wear, which is much better than before liberation. An old farmer told me that now we add a little dish, and we eat our fill every day, but before liberation, who ever had a full meal?" Zhang Li breathed a sigh of relief, "We still have to compare, comparing to before liberation is good." Li Xiuzhen said, blushing, and took out a letter for us to read. She also said, "Master Yao told my father everything about me. My father sent me a letter from Taiyuan, and this is it. He scolded me severely, saying that Master Yao watched me grow up, and I should listen to him. He also asked me to talk about the bitter days of the past during the rectification, so that everyone would know the bitterness of the past and appreciate the sweetness of today." Sun Min chimed in, "Yes, I'll also tell everyone about the situation in the coal mine. People mine coal from dozens of feet underground, never seeing the sun, and having to wade through water. Compared to them, our work is too easy."

Now, the young men are not talking about the flamboyant Three Fairies, but secretly praising them as hard-working and thrifty girls. No one ever says they are afraid of dirt and fatigue anymore, but praises them as brave and hardworking girls.

One day, Xiao Zhang told me again, "The Three Fairies have changed. The other day, I went to push coal with them, and they had more energy than me. The cart was pushed so fast, you could hear them everywhere, their faces full of ash, and their whole bodies looking like coal miners, but they happily sang and danced. Sun Min's hand got a blister from shoveling coal, but she kept working. I told her to take a break, and guess what she said? She said that the veteran workers in the Jingxi Coal Mine work much harder than this, and building socialism requires drive. Hey! Rectification is really good."

The Three Fairies have indeed changed. One day, I ran into them in the dining hall. They were all wearing plain clothes, and Zhang Li had braided her permed hair, which made her look even more petite. I jokingly asked, "You three sisters have changed your appearance." Sun Min said frankly, "We are the working class; we have to look like the working class." Li Xiuzhen continued, "The three of us have established a rule: we don't eat first-class dishes, we eliminate second-class dishes, and we eat more cornbread. Are you brave enough to join us?" I said, "Sure! If the fairies can eat it, how can I, a mere mortal, not eat it?" Zhang Li blushed and threatened me, "If you talk nonsense again, we won't spare you."

From then on, the names "Three Fairies" and "Seven Fairies" disappeared from our factory, swept away from the young people without a trace.

    三仙
    石景山发电厂工人　阎一忠
    去年春天，厂里的青年们，常常在背地里谈论三仙。我问三仙是怎么回事，问谁，谁就冲我挤挤眼，咧开嘴笑一笑。大家越不说，我越想知道这个秘密。一天，我抓住一个小伙子，非让他告诉我三仙是怎么回事不可，不说我不放他走。说也凑巧，他狡猾的努努嘴小声说：“那不是三仙来了”。我朝他努的方向望去，我恍然大悟，原来三仙是个集体外号。
    走来的是三位姑娘，她们都是我们车间的，一个是李秀珍，一个是孙敏，一个是张丽，三个人并排有说有笑的走着。李秀珍穿着一件在胸部绣有小粉花的红毛衣，孙敏穿一件绿毛衣，张丽穿一件黄地红花的翻领毛衣。下面全是鲜艳的裙子。半高跟的皮鞋走在水泥路上，发出清脆的“格得”、“格得”的声音。怪不得呢，大家称她们三仙，她们晃晃悠悠走在穿工作服的人们当中，实在有些扎眼。
    到了夏天，形势更严重了，新来的四个初中毕业的女徒工，学起了三仙的样子，发展成了七仙，挑皮的小伙子们，私下里议论着她们。
    小张告诉我说：“阎一忠，李秀珍花十七块钱做了一个汗衫，张丽这个月买了三双皮鞋”。
    我问了句：“生产搞的还好吧？”小张撇了撇嘴说：“哼！好什么，她们那伙人都不愿干累活，孙敏是个技术员，整天坐在实验室里看书，从不出来，八个钟头的班，看六小时的书，我干活也不叫她，带她们更累赘。”
    整风开始了，可是三仙很少参加活动，辩论会也不参加，好像风刮不到她们身上，这使我心里更沉重，后来，党中央提出全民整风运动，她们才勉强参加了。
    9月末的一个小组会上，姚福老师傅发言说：“现在的年青人太不像话，不爱干这个，不爱干那个，挑挑拣拣，以后来了，先推三年煤改造改造。”
    姚师傅提出这个绝好的方法后，青年们三三俩俩的嘀咕了一阵，有人不满意的吱吱两声，可就是没有人出来反驳。正当这当儿，李秀珍活动了一下身子，用眼睛扫了扫会上的年青人说：“我不同意姚师傅的说法，这是限制青年人的前途，推煤有什么学头，没必要。”她说完后，姚师傅点起了一袋烟，皱着眉抽起来。
    青年们听完李秀珍的发言，活跃了。李秀珍又接着说了一句：“我觉得老师傅们嫌我们青年人升级快，去叫我们推煤这么做不对！”这一下可触了姚师傅，姚师傅微微欠起了身子，激动的冲李秀珍说：“你叫大家伙听听，你说的是什么话，秀珍，你忘了你小时候拣煤核啦！”李秀珍一听姚师傅揭她的底，脸刷的一下子红到耳根，又由红变得苍白了。
    第二天，我听张丽说，李秀珍哭的眼睛通红，终日戴着口罩，见到谁也不理，黄昏的时候，她见到我，低着头走过去，我知道她不愿回想过去的日子，更不愿让别人知道她过去的生活。我清清楚楚的记得，解放前李大娘领着我和李秀珍到厂里拣煤核。有一次她的手被红煤块烫伤了，至今手上还有一个小伤疤。那时她是个手里提着一个破竹篮子，衣裳褴褛的小女孩。我真想和她聊一聊，然而时间没能使我遂愿，不两天，李秀珍参加访问农村的代表团，到太行山区去了。
    10月下旬的一个晚上，吃过饭后，我去找张丽，想向她了解了解她和孙敏访问京西煤矿的经过，和访问城里公私合营小型工厂的感想。离张丽的宿舍老远，就听到屋里传出的喧闹声，熟悉的声音告诉我，屋中不只一个人，果然，屋里除了张丽以外还有孙敏，李秀珍，三个人争先恐后的嚷着说自己的经历，她们招呼了我一声，就又吵起来，我假问道：“你们姐三个又在争论谁的衣料好呐，来，给我鉴赏鉴赏，我的结论准公平。”孙敏不高兴的说：“你老下结论，没你事，你好好听着，李秀珍正说乡下事呢。”
    李秀珍接着说：“别看农民生活苦，可有一股干劲呢，人家明年还要增产多交公粮，交还交最好的饱实的。”我问：“苦什么？”李秀珍说：“一个县长一个月才挣九十块钱，人家打过游击，还是个老干部，农民就更差了。”我又问：“和谁比呢？”李秀珍想了一想说：“和我比呗！我一月拿八、九十块钱，和一个县长差不多。”我又问：“怎么人家还有劲头呢？”李秀珍立即说：“现在够吃、够喝、有房住有衣穿，比起解放前强多喽，一个农民老大爷对我说，现在添点菜，天天有饱吃，可解放前，谁吃过一顿饱饭呀。”张丽嘘了一口气：“还是得比，比比解放前是好。”李秀珍说着红着脸拿出一封信，让我们看，还说：“姚师傅把我的事全告诉我爸爸了，我爸从太原给我寄来一封信，就是这个，他狠狠的骂了我一顿，说姚师傅是看着我长大的，要听他的话，还叫我在整风中给青年们讲讲过去的苦日子，只有让大家知道过去的苦，才体会到今日的甜。”孙敏又插上去说：“对，我也给大家介绍介绍煤矿里的情况，人家从几十丈深的井底下，往上采煤，见不着太阳，还得趟水，和咱们比起来，咱们工作太轻松了。”
    现在，小伙子们谈论的不是花枝招展的三仙，而暗地里夸她们是勤劳节俭的姑娘，从来也没有人再说她们怕脏怕累，而赞她们是勇敢肯干的女孩子了。
    有一天，小张又告诉我说：“三仙可变啦，那天我和她们推煤去，她们比我的劲头还足。车推的飞快，到处就听她们的了，满脸灰，浑身上下像个煤黑子，可是却高兴的唱呀、跳呀。孙敏的手铲煤磨出了个泡，还干，我劝她歇会，你猜她说什么，她说，京西煤矿的老师傅，干活比这累多了，建设社会主义要有干劲，嘿！整风真好啊。”
    三仙确实变了，一天我在饭厅碰到了她们，她们穿的全是朴素的衣裳，张丽把烫的头也梳成了小辫，更显得玲珑了，我打趣地问：“姐儿仨变了样啦。”孙敏痛痛快快地说：“工人阶级嘛，就得像个工人阶级样。”李秀珍接着说：“我们三个定了个制度，不吃甲菜，消灭乙菜，多吃窝头。你敢参加吗？”我说：“行！仙女们都吃得了，我凡夫俗子怎么吃不了？”张丽红着脸威胁我说：“以后你再胡说，我们可饶不了你。”
    从此，三仙和七仙的名字，在我们厂里销声匿迹，它从青年人的身上刮走了，刮的无影无踪。
