Xinhua News Agency, 8th - In order to meet the needs of further expanded reproduction, the proportion of agricultural cooperatives' public accumulation funds can be appropriately increased. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a resolution.
The Resolution of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Regarding Appropriately Increasing the Proportion of Public Accumulation Funds of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives

Adopted at the 90th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on January 6, 1958

Adopted at the 90th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on January 6, 1958, after discussing Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal from the State Council regarding appropriately increasing the proportion of public accumulation funds of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and in view of the development of a new high tide in agricultural production, in order to appropriately meet the needs of agricultural production cooperatives to further expand reproduction, the proportion of public accumulation funds retained by agricultural production cooperatives can be appropriately increased. Therefore, it is decided to make the following changes to Article 43 of the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives regarding the proportion of public accumulation funds retained by agricultural production cooperatives: On the basis of continuous production growth, and under the principle of ensuring that the income of the vast majority of members increases year by year, the proportion of public accumulation funds retained by agricultural production cooperatives from the total annual income in kind and cash, after paying taxes in accordance with national regulations and deducting production expenses, and after discussion and decision by the members' congress or members' representative congress, including the repayment of basic construction loans and investments that are due, can exceed 8%. For cooperatives engaged in economic crops, it can exceed 12%. However, it should not be exceeded by too much, so as not to affect the annual increase in the income of the vast majority of members. As for situations of bumper or lean years, where more or less public accumulation funds need to be retained, or none at all, it shall still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 43 of the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

    为了满足进一步扩大再生产的需要
    农业社公积金比例可适当提高
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议通过决定
    新华社8日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于适当提高高级农业生产合作社公积金比例的决定
    一九五八年一月六日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十次会议通过
    一九五八年一月六日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十次会议讨论了国务院周恩来总理提出的关于适当提高高级农业生产合作社公积金比例的议案，鉴于农业生产新高潮的发展，为了适当满足农业生产合作社进一步扩大再生产的需要，农业生产合作社所留公积金的比例可以适当提高，因此决定对高级农业生产合作社示范章程第四十三条关于农业生产合作社所留公积金比例的规定作如下的改变：在生产不断增长的基础上，并且在保证绝大多数社员的收入逐年有所增加的原则下，农业生产合作社全年收入的实物和现金在依照国家的规定纳税并且扣除生产消耗以后，经过社员大会或者社员代表大会讨论决定，农业生产合作社所留公积金的比例包括归还到期的基本建设的贷款和投资在内，可以超过8％，经营经济作物的合作社，可以超过12％。但是，也不宜超过太多，以免影响绝大多数社员收入的逐年增加。至于遇到丰年或者荒年，公积金需要多留或者少留或者不留，仍然按照高级农业生产合作社示范章程第四十三条的规定办理。
