Dear comrades who have been sent to lower levels to participate in labor training:

    Today is the first day of 1958, and also the first day of our country's socialist construction entering the Second Five-Year Plan. Please allow me to extend to you exceptionally warm congratulations.

    The sending down of cadres, for the most part, involves participation in physical labor, primarily agricultural labor, with a small portion participating in grassroots work. This means that those who have not labored before will go to labor for training; those who come from labor can also return to labor. On the other hand, our cadres can move up or down; they can work at the higher levels or at the lower levels; they can lead others in their work, or they can be led by others in their work. This is a major change in the system, that is, a change in people's consciousness. You were the first to respond to the call of the Party and the government, seizing the first credit for "organ cadres going to the countryside and up to the mountains, and intellectuals participating in labor training." This is the beginning of your personal extraordinary undertaking, and also the beginning of an extraordinary undertaking for the entire social system and cause.

    As everyone knows, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce only achieved victory in the socialist revolution in changing the private ownership of the means of production, and not yet in achieving victory in the socialist revolution in people's ideologies. It is necessary to carry out a great socialist revolution politically and ideologically in order to prevent the bad ideas and bad habits of the old society that remain among the people from being revived, to prevent domestic and foreign reactionaries and enemies who plot to undermine the people's cause from having any opportunity to take advantage of, and to enable the socialist construction cause to advance a thousand miles a day. Organ cadres and intellectuals are an important link in this revolution; they are transforming people, and first they must be transformed themselves; they are educating people, and first they must be educated themselves. How to be transformed and how to be educated is not only靠靠 on books, but must be trained in labor. Through labor, establish genuine feelings with the working people; through labor, transform oneself into a genuine working-class intellectual.

    Our country has already set off a new upsurge in production. The people of the whole country are engaging in various intense labors of building socialism in a vigorous and unprecedentedly enthusiastic manner. The resounding slogans of "catching up with England in fifteen years" and "completing the agricultural production development program targets ahead of schedule and exceeding them" excite the heartstrings of everyone and become a great driving force to inspire people to march forward to socialism. This is an extremely favorable condition for you to participate in labor training. You should, together with the local working people, forge ahead bravely, actively and diligently, and thoroughly complete the labor training tasks entrusted to you by the leadership and expected of you by the people.

    Of course, you will encounter some difficulties in your actual work, such as being unaccustomed to life, having poor production skills, and feeling physically tired, etc. However, this is not to be feared. As long as you have a correct understanding of labor training, and do not bow your heads to difficulties, the difficulties will bow their heads to you, and you will achieve a complete victory.

    You will certainly become a strong and powerful force in socialist construction.

    In order to congratulate the comrades on their work victory and good health, I write a poem:

    Who laments the difficulty of travel, going down to the countryside and up the mountains again. The countryside is a treasure countryside, the mountains are embroidered mountains.
    Labor creates everything, with thousands of patterns. Sowing, transplanting, plowing, harrowing, harvesting, only then can there be food on the plate.
    Workers are diligent and skillful, only then can there be a list of general merchandise. Go to labor yourself, only then will you know the sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness.
    Grassroots workers, knowledge is endless. What is learned from books is insignificant and not worth mentioning.
    People welcome you, and you are not just playing. Physical strength and mental strength, train them into one pill.
    "Nothingness" flourishes and "capital" is completely destroyed, eliminating the enemy from the roots. His name is: passing the test of socialism.

### 元旦致下放干部
谢觉哉

    元旦致下放干部
    谢觉哉亲爱的下放参加劳动锻炼的同志们：
    今天是1958年的第一天，也是我国社会主义建设进入第二个五年计划的第一天。请让我向你们致以异乎寻常的热烈的祝贺。
    干部下放，绝大部分是参加体力劳动，首先是农业劳动，很小部分是参加基层工作。这就是说：没劳动过的人要去劳动中锻炼；从劳动中来的人也可以仍回到劳动中去。另一方面，我们的干部，可上可下；可以在上层工作，也可以在下层工作；可以领导别人工作，也可以被别人领导工作。这是一个很大的制度改变，也即是人们意识上的改变。你们首先响应了党和政府的号召，抢了“机关干部下乡上山、知识分子参加劳动锻炼”的头功。这是你们个人不平凡事业的开始，也是整个社会制度与事业不平凡的开始。
    大家晓得，农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，只是在改变了生产资料的私人所有制上取得社会主义革命的胜利，还并不是在人们的意识形态上取得了社会主义革命的胜利。必须是政治上、思想上实行伟大的社会主义革命，才能使残存在人们中间的旧社会的坏思想、坏习惯不能复活，才能使国内外反动派、阴谋破坏人民事业的敌人无机可乘，才能使社会主义建设事业一日千里的前进。机关干部和知识分子是这个革命中的重要环节，他们是改造人的，首先自己要得到改造；他们是教育人的，首先自己要受到教育。怎样得到改造和怎样受教育，不是只靠书本子，而是必须到劳动中去锻炼。通过劳动，同劳动人民建立真正的感情；通过劳动，使自己变成真正的工人阶级的知识分子。
    我们国家已经掀起了新的生产高潮，全国人民正在风起云涌地、热情空前地从事着建设社会主义的各种紧张劳动，“十五年赶上英国”、“提前和超额完成农业生产发展纲要指标”的响亮口号，激动着每一个人的心弦，成为鼓舞人们向社会主义大进军的伟大动力，这是你们参加劳动锻炼的极其有利的条件。你们应当同当地劳动人民一道，勇往直前，积极努力，彻底地完成领导上交给你们的、也是人民期望你们的劳动锻炼的任务。
    当然，你们在实际工作中会遇到一些困难，比如生活不习惯，生产技术差，身体会感到疲累等等。但是，这并不足怕，只要你们对劳动锻炼有正确的认识，不向困难低头，困难就会向你们低头，你们就会取得彻底的胜利。
    你们一定能成为社会主义建设的强有力的队伍。
    为了祝贺同志们的工作胜利、身体健康，写诗一首：
    谁嗟行路难，下乡又上山。乡是宝玉乡，山是锦绣山。
    劳动造一切，花样有千般。播、莳、犁、耙、割，才有盘中餐。
    工人勤又巧，才有百货单。躬自去劳动，才知甜酸咸。
    基层工作者，知识数不完。书本上所学，渺小不足谈。
    人家欢迎你，你也不是玩。体力与脑力，锻炼成一丸。
    “无”兴“资”全灭，从根除敌顽。他的名字是：过社会主义的关。
