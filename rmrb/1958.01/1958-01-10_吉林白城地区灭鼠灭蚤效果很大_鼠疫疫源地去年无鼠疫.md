    Significant Results in Rat and Flea Extermination in Baicheng Area, Jilin
    No Plague in Plague Focus Area Last Year

    (Our dispatch) Baicheng area in Jilin Province, where plague had been prevalent for over 40 years, reported no cases of plague last year. It is projected that the plague will be completely eradicated in the next three to five years.

    In the past two years, the Party and government organs in the Baicheng area have conscientiously implemented the central government's directives on eliminating endemic diseases and eradicating the four pests, mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to launch a large-scale rat and flea extermination campaign. In the spring of 1956, over 360,000 people in the entire region participated in poisoning yellow rats, recovering over 116,900 rat carcasses. In 1957, over 440,000 people in the entire region were mobilized to poison yellow rats, recovering over 69,300 rat carcasses. According to surveys, in 1950, there were 58 rat holes per hectare of land, while in 1957, there were only 6 rat holes per hectare. In 1951, there were over 100 rat holes per 100 rooms, while in 1956, there were only 3 rat holes per 100 rooms. The number of fleas indoors has also been significantly reduced.

    The eleven counties in the Baicheng area were previously plague focus areas. According to historical records, human plague cases first appeared in a few areas of this region in 1910 (or 1911). After 1932, the plague-affected areas gradually expanded, and the number of cases increased year by year. According to incomplete statistics, from 1910 to 1920, there were a total of over 1,520 plague patients, with a mortality rate of 98%. From 1931 to 1944, there were a total of over 9,230 plague patients, with a mortality rate of 83%. From 1945 to 1948, there were as many as 6,890 plague patients, with a mortality rate of 90%. Since the founding of New China, the state has allocated large amounts of epidemic prevention funds, mobilized the broad masses, and adopted comprehensive epidemic prevention measures (rat and flea extermination, preventive vaccinations, and promotion of sanitation campaigns, etc.), vigorously carrying out epidemic prevention work, which has resulted in a gradual decrease in plague cases year by year. From 1949 to 1955, there were a total of 795 plague patients, with a mortality rate of 37%. Last year, no plague patients were found in this area.

    The Baicheng area plans to eliminate the plague by 1960, or at the latest by 1962, and to eradicate the rats and fleas that transmit the plague. (Wen Shuxian)

    吉林白城地区灭鼠灭蚤效果很大
    鼠疫疫源地去年无鼠疫
    本报讯　鼠疫流行了四十多年的吉林省白城地区，去年没有发生鼠疫，今后三、五年里将完全消灭鼠疫。
    近两年来，白城地区党政机关认真地贯彻了中央关于消灭地方病和除四害的指示，动员全党和全体人民，展开了大规模的灭鼠灭蚤运动。1956年春天，全专区有三十六万多人次进行毒杀黄鼠的工作，收回鼠尸十一万六千九百多只。1957年全专区动员了四十四万多人次进行毒杀黄鼠的工作，收回鼠尸六万九千三百多只。据调查，1950年每公顷地有鼠洞五十八个，1957年每公顷只有六个鼠洞；1951年每百间房子有一百多个鼠洞，1956年每百间房子只有三个鼠洞；室内的跳蚤也大大减少了。
    白城地区十一个县过去是鼠疫疫源地。根据历史资料记载，1910年（或1911年）人间鼠疫便在这个地区的少数地方发生，1932年以后，鼠疫传染地区逐年扩大，发病人数逐年增多。据不完全统计，1910年至1920年的十一年里，鼠疫患者共有一千五百二十多人，死亡率达到98％；从1931年到1944年的十四年里，鼠疫患者共九千二百三十多人，死亡率占83％；从1945年至1948年的四年中，鼠疫患者达六千八百九十人，死亡率占90％。新中国成立以后，国家拨出了大笔防疫经费，发动广大群众，采取了综合性防疫措施（捕鼠灭蚤、预防注射、开展清洁卫生运动等），大力开展了防疫工作，使鼠疫患者逐年减少。自1949年至1955年，鼠疫患者共有七百九十五人，死亡率占37％，去年这个地区没有发现鼠疫患者。
    白城地区计划在1960年最迟在1962年消灭鼠疫，并且消灭传播鼠疫的老鼠和跳蚤。　（温述仙）
