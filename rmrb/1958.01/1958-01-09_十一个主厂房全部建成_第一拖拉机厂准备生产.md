Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 7th - The construction of all eleven main workshops of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant has been completed. Thus, the plant has entered a new stage of construction focused on production preparations.

Since construction of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant began in mid-September 1955, despite encountering many difficulties, the construction of most of the workshops was completed at a relatively fast pace. Through a series of construction projects, the construction engineering departments have accumulated experience in building large-scale enterprises. If construction were to be carried out with the current construction force, the construction period for a plant of the same scale could be shortened by half.

Currently, among the eleven main workshops of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, auxiliary, forging, non-ferrous metal casting, and woodworking workshops have been put into trial production. In the auxiliary workshop, tools, fixtures, and non-standard equipment for manufacturing tractors are being produced. Thousands of production workers and enterprise management personnel have been assembled in the entire plant. They are currently engaged in the translation and replication of products and technical preparations for product production.

    十一个主厂房全部建成
    第一拖拉机厂准备生产
    新华社洛阳7日电　第一拖拉机制造厂的十一个主厂房建筑工程已经全部建成。至此，这个厂已进入以生产准备工作为中心的建设新阶段。
    第一拖拉机制造厂从1955年9月中旬动工兴建以来，尽管遇到许多困难，但是大部分厂房的建筑工程，都以比较快的速度完成了。通过一系列的建设，使建筑工程部门积累了建筑大型企业的经验。如果以现在的施工力量进行建设，今后建设同样规模的一个厂，施工期限可以缩短一半的时间。
    目前，第一拖拉机制造厂的十一个主要工场中，已有辅助、锻工、有色修铸、木工等工场投入了试生产。在辅助工场里，正在生产制造拖拉机的工具、夹具和非标准设备。全厂的生产工人和企业管理人员，已集中了几千人。他们正在进行产品的翻译复制工作和产品生产的技术准备工作。
