The Third Broadcast Gymnastics Exercise has been promulgated, and a high tide of participating in broadcast gymnastics exercises has been set off among workers, soldiers, students, and cadres in institutions across the country. Many provincial and municipal sports commissions and related departments have jointly issued notices on carrying out winter sports activities, making broadcast gymnastics more widespread and in-depth than in previous years. Many good methods have been adopted, such as organizing instructor "short training classes," "teaching stations," and "evaluation months." Many units in Beijing sent special personnel to learn the new exercise and invited sports workers to explain the key points of the new exercise and conduct teaching. This attracted a wide range of people to participate in broadcast gymnastics exercises and promoted other sports activities. This has played a significant role in popularizing mass sports and promoting human health.

According to reports from various places, the eight sections of the Third Broadcast Gymnastics Exercise for adults are simple and easy to learn, which meets the physical conditions of the majority of people participating in the exercise. The amount of exercise is greater than the previous two sets of exercises, and people feel relaxed and comfortable throughout their bodies after doing the exercises. Many people insist on doing the exercises seriously, their appetite has become sweeter, their sleep has improved, and they are full of energy. Therefore, it has had a good effect on improving production, work, and study efficiency.

Some people also reported that they felt strenuous when doing this set of exercises and felt muscle pain after starting to exercise. As everyone knows, the first section of stretching exercises, the second section of squatting exercises, the third section of leg-kicking exercises, the fourth section of forward and backward bending exercises, and the sixth section of body circling exercises all have gentle and strong chest expansion movements. Because we lack the foundation of sports and chest movements in our daily life, the chest muscles are stretched and feel sore when we start to exercise, which shows that the exercisers are doing the exercises seriously and achieving results. If you persist in exercising gradually, you will not feel sore after a short period of soreness, and the muscles and bones will be developed. The horse-riding stance in the second section of squatting exercises, the leg-spreading stance in the seventh section of full-body exercises, and the jumping exercises in the eighth section are important movements for strengthening lower limb strength. This has a positive effect on comrades who often sit in the office. Some comrades feel sore in their legs when they start to exercise, which is the same as the situation mentioned above, and they must persist in exercising. Some comrades also reported that the arm circling movements to the left (right) in the fifth section of lateral bending exercises are not easy to master. The key to doing this movement is to relax the arm joints and muscles to make it easier to do well. This section of exercise and the sixth section of body circling exercises are the exercises with the largest waist and spine movements in this set of exercises. Everyone must gradually increase the activity according to their physical fitness and physical condition, and do not make sudden and excessive movements.

When doing broadcast gymnastics, it is also necessary to master the correct posture in order to achieve effective exercise purposes. Doing it seriously, vigorously, and regularly can enhance physical fitness. If you feel that the amount of exercise is small after doing the exercise once, you can do it a second time in a row. Work breaks, mornings, and evenings can be appropriately adjusted and increased the amount of exercise. In areas with severe cold weather in winter, it is even more important to persist in exercising. The folk proverb of practicing martial arts: "Practice kung fu in winter, practice skills in summer" means that it is not easy to sweat and feel tired when exercising in winter, the exercise effect is great, and it also enhances the ability to resist cold; it is easy to sweat when exercising in summer, which is convenient for flexing joints and stretching muscles.

Composers such as Shi Lemeng have composed music for the third set of broadcast gymnastics for children, teenagers, and adults, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station has recorded the records. These musical pieces are composed according to the tension and relaxation, fast and slow, exertion and relaxation of each section of the gymnastics movements. Each record has its own characteristics and national style. Many people do not understand the benefits of matching broadcast gymnastics with music. The purpose of matching music is to increase the interest of the exercisers and make them feel relaxed and happy when doing the exercises, so as to achieve better exercise results. Soviet sports physiologists have proved in experiments that doing gymnastics with musical accompaniment will increase the breathing rate and lung ventilation of the exercisers, and at the same time, the amplitude, depth, and oxygen absorption of breathing will also increase. Experiments have also proved that the combination of music and movement becomes the stimulator of this movement, making the exercisers do it more easily.

    第三套广播体操有哪些好处？
    江平
    第三套广播体操公布后，全国各地工人、战士、学生和机关干部掀起了参加广播体操锻炼的高潮。有许多省市体育运动委员会和有关方面联合发出了开展冬季体育活动的通知，使广播体操比往年更加广泛深入地开展起来；并采取了许多好的办法，如组织了领操员“短训班”、“传授站”和“评比月”。北京市不少单位，派了专人学新操和邀请了体育工作者讲解新操要领，进行教操。这样作吸引了广泛的人们参加广播体操的锻炼，并推动了其他体育活动。这对普及群众体育运动、促进人体健康起了很大的作用。
    各地反映第三套成人广播体操中的八节动作，简单易学，符合广大人民参加锻炼的身体条件。运动量比前两套操大，作操后感到全身肌骨舒展轻松。许多人坚持认真地作操，吃饭香甜了，睡眠也好了，精神充沛，因而对提高生产、工作和学习效率，收到了良好的效果。
    也有人反映作这套操感到吃力和开始锻炼后觉得肌骨酸痛。大家知道第一节伸展运动、第二节下蹲运动、第三节踢腿运动、第四节体前后屈运动和第六节体回环运动中，都有缓和的、强烈的扩胸动作。由于我们缺少体育运动的基础和平时生活中的胸部动作，因之开始锻炼时，胸腔肌肉拉长觉得酸痛，这正是说明作操人认真作操收到的效果。如果循序渐进地坚持锻炼，在经过一个短时期的酸痛的过程后就不会再觉得酸痛，肌骨会得到发育。这套操第二节下蹲运动中的骑马蹲裆式、第七节全身运动中的铺腿式和第八节的跳跃运动，是锻炼下肢力量的重要动作。这对于常坐办公室的同志有积极作用，有的同志开始锻炼时觉得两腿酸痛，同上边所谈的情况是相同的道理，必须要坚持锻炼下去。有的同志还反映第五节体侧屈运动中两臂向左（右）绕环动作不好掌握，作这动作的要领，两臂关节和肌肉必须放松才容易作好。这节操和第六节体回环运动，是这套操腰部和脊椎运动很大的动作，每人必须根据体质和体能条件，逐步由小到大，不要作突然过猛的活动。
    作广播操时还必须要掌握正确的姿式，才能达到有效的锻炼目的。认真作、用力作和经常作，才能增强体质。如果作完一次操觉得运动量小，可以连续作第二次。工间、早晨和晚间都可适宜的调剂和增加运动量。冬季天气严寒的地区，更要坚持锻炼。民间练武术的谚语：“冬练功夫，夏练身手”，就是说冬天锻炼不易出汗和疲惫，锻炼效果大，也增强了抗寒的力量；夏天锻炼容易出汗，对于灵活关节和伸长肌肉就方便。
    第三套儿童、少年和成人广播体操，已有作曲家时乐蒙等配好了乐曲，由中央人民广播电台灌好了唱片。这些乐曲根据每节体操动作的紧张和弛缓，快和慢，用力和放松的情况而配制的，各个唱片有其特色和民族风格。有很多人不了解广播体操配音乐的好处，配音乐的目的就是因为有了悦耳的音乐，使作操人增加了兴趣和作操时感到轻松愉快，因而收到更好的锻炼效果。苏联的运动生理学家在实验中证明：在音乐伴奏之下作体操，会增加作操人的呼吸率和肺脏换气量，同时呼吸的幅度、深度以及氧气的吸收量也有所增加。实验还证明音乐和动作相结合后，就成了这种动作的激发者，使作操人作得更轻松。
