    Peach Blossom Spring, Qu Zi Temple
    Restored to Ancient Appearance

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: Relevant departments in Hunan Province have recently renovated famous historical sites such as Peach Blossom Spring, Qu Zi Temple, and Cai Lun's Tomb.

    Peach Blossom Spring is located fifteen kilometers south of Taoyuan County, on the right side of the Tao (yuan) Yuan (ling) highway, in a valley between two small mountains. Here, ancient trees tower to the sky, and bamboo forests abound. The famous scenic spots that have captivated generations of poets and writers, such as the Six-Corner Pavilion, Encounter Immortal Bridge, Eight-Corner Pavilion, Jixian Temple, Xiangyang Bridge, Chrysanthemum Pavilion, Ancient Peach Blossom Pool, and Qin People's Ancient Cave, have now been restored to their ancient architectural appearance. The restoration is based on the architectural style of the Qing Dynasty.

    The ancestral hall, temples, and tombs of our great poet Qu Yuan have also been repaired. Qu Zi Temple is located about ten miles west of Miluo Station in Xiangyin County, and Qu Zi Tomb is located about six or seven miles east of the station. On Yusu Mountain, where Qu Yuan lived in exile, in addition to the Qu Zi Temple rebuilt during the Qing Dynasty, there are also the remains of his former residence.

    The ancestral hall and tomb of Cai Lun, the first person in our country to invent papermaking in the Han Dynasty, have also been renovated. The ancestral hall and tomb are located outside the south gate of Leiyang County, which was where Cai Lun lived at the time.

    桃花源　屈子祠
    恢复古代面貌
    据新华社长沙18日电　湖南省有关部门最近整修了桃花源、屈子祠、蔡伦墓等名胜古迹。
    桃花源在桃源县城南十五公里桃（源）沅（陵）公路的右侧，在两座小山夹着的一片山谷里。这里古树参天，修竹成林。引起历代骚客诗人留连忘返的六角亭、遇仙桥、八角亭、集贤观、向阳桥、菊花亭、古桃花潭和秦人古洞等名胜，现在已一一恢复了古代建筑的面貌。现在是按照清代建筑的风格重新修复的。
    我国伟大诗人屈原的祠堂、庙宇和坟墓也都已修葺好了。屈子祠在湘阴县汨罗车站西约十里，屈子墓在车站东约六七里。屈原被流放时居住的玉笥山上，现在除了有清代移建的屈子祠外，还有他的旧宅的遗址。
    我国第一个发明造纸的人——汉代蔡伦的祠堂和他的坟墓也同样整修好了。祠堂和坟墓都在耒阳县城南门外，就是当时蔡伦居住的地方。
