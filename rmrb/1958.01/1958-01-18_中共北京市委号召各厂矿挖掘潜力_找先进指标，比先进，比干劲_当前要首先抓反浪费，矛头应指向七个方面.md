    Beijing News - The person in charge of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a recent joint meeting of party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders, requested that all 54 state-owned factories and mines in the city find advanced indicators, compete with the advanced, and compete with enthusiasm. The meeting decided that the Party committees of all factories and mines should finalize their annual plans for this year by the end of January and put forward the indicators of their respective enterprises for comparison with the advanced indicators of brother factories and mines across the country. Those with lagging indicators must analyze the reasons for the lag, actively improve, and catch up.

    The person in charge of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee believes that large potential and large waste are the basic situations of state-owned industries in Beijing. To fully tap the potential strength of enterprises, eliminate waste, and improve the management level of enterprises, it is necessary to have a revolutionary spirit of finding advanced indicators, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, like the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory.

    Facts have proven that as long as the thinking of the enterprise leaders is clear, there is great potential to be tapped in the enterprise. For example, when the Beijing Municipal Postal and Telecommunications管理局 originally formulated the 1958 plan, the profit to be turned over was only 250,000 yuan. Later, the leaders of this enterprise considered that the actual performance in 1957 was 1.2 million yuan. Could this year be worse than last year? After criticism and self-criticism, and a full investigation and study of the enterprise's situation, their thinking was clear, and the profit plan to be turned over suddenly rose to 3 million yuan. Another example is the Agricultural Machinery Factory, which last year used 1,800 workdays to produce one combine harvester. The original plan for this year was more than 1,600 workdays, but after several investigations and calculations, only 1,000 workdays were needed. In this way, the factory can free up 650,000 workdays throughout the year to accept other agricultural machinery production tasks.

    This person in charge believes that, under the current circumstances, to fully tap the potential of enterprises, the first task is to continue to deepen the special topic of anti-waste. The aspects of opposing waste in factories and mines are broad. In addition to non-productive items such as operating expenses, cultural and living supplies, and labor protection supplies, the waste of raw materials, man-hours, and tools is also alarming. Therefore, the spearhead of anti-waste should be directed at the following seven aspects:

    First, stockpiling raw materials, materials, and equipment. According to the materials currently revealed by employees in the anti-waste campaign, the figures in this area are considerable. A certain type of drill bit stockpiled by the Radio Factory can be used for 40 years; the files stockpiled by the Auto Parts Factory can be used for 30 years; a certain type of report stockpiled by the No. 3 State Cotton Mill will not be used up in 40 years; the Trolleybus Company spent 32,000 yuan to buy a dispatch telephone, which has been placed in the warehouse for more than a year and has not yet been used. The company has 11 cement poles worth 3,300 yuan, which have been placed in Donghuangchenggen for three years. The management department did not know about it until the workers raised their opinions recently before they began to use them.

    Second, waste caused by unreasonable work quotas. A certain work quota in the Auto Parts Factory has exceeded six times, but has not been revised.

    Third, waste caused by the stockpiling of materials in numerous small warehouses. Facts have proven that there are small warehouses not only in the workshops but also in the work sections. For example, in a work section of the repair workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant, there are only 38 people, but the stockpiling of tools is quite serious. There are 38 hand hammers in their small warehouse, but in fact, three are enough; 28 adjustable wrenches, but in fact, three are enough; 14 steel shears, 12 too many; some calipers, levels, saw blades, sledgehammers, and other tools are stockpiled in more than ten pieces, some are stockpiled in more than thirty pieces, and some are simply not used. A certain factory's assembly workshop cleared out its small warehouse and removed more than 70,000 yuan worth of surplus materials and tools in one go.

    Fourth, waste caused by defective products. The No. 3 State Cotton Mill produced 35,000 defective bolts of cloth within three months last year, and used more than 7,900 kilograms of extra cotton yarn. The NanKou Parts Factory's defective products accounted for 6% of the total output in the year before last and 3% last year.

    Fifth, waste caused by random scrapping. Instead of trying to repair defective products, they are simply scrapped. For example, the Electron Tube Factory found 1,200 meters of valuable good tungsten wire from defective tungsten filaments. Another example is that the General Affairs Section of the Radio Equipment Factory found 400 yuan worth of materials from the garbage dump. The appraisal and repair team of a workshop in a certain factory put forward the slogan of asking for materials from the scrap warehouse and repaired a batch of gears worth 5,000 yuan with these materials in one go.

    Sixth, waste caused by inconsiderate design. For example, the rough casting for the drawbar designed by the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory weighed 450 kilograms, but the finished product weighed only 200 kilograms. This not only wasted more than 200 kilograms of steel but also wasted cutting time.

    Seventh, waste caused by poor planning and scheduling. This is more prominent in the transportation sector. For example, after the Beijing Railway Bureau initially adjusted its planning and scheduling work, it can save the country 30 locomotives this year alone.

    Finally, the person in charge pointed out that opposing waste not only has huge economic significance but also has extremely profound political influence. For enterprises, opposing waste is also a work of changing customs and habits, which enables people to develop a style of cherishing national property and paying attention to economy at all times and in all places. In this way, it is possible to gradually root the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical in enterprises.

    中共北京市委号召各厂矿挖掘潜力
    找先进指标，比先进，比干劲
    当前要首先抓反浪费，矛头应指向七个方面
    本报讯　中共北京市委工业部负责人在最近召开的一次党政工团负责人联席会议上，要求全市五十四个国营厂矿企业都来找先进指标，比先进，比干劲。会议决定各厂矿党委要在1月底做好今年年度计划，并且把本企业的指标拿出来和全国兄弟厂矿的先进指标评比。凡是指标落后的，就必须分析落后的原因，积极改进，迎头赶上。
    北京市委工业部负责人认为，潜力大、浪费大，是北京市国营工业的基本情况。要充分发掘企业的潜在力量，杜绝浪费，提高企业的管理水平，必须像长辛店机车车辆修理工厂那样，拿出找先进指标，向先进看齐和赶上先进的一股革命干劲来。
    事实证明，只要企业领导人员的思想通了，企业里就大有潜力可挖。如北京市邮电管理局原来在拟定1958年计划时，上交利润只有二十五万元，后来这个企业的领导人员一考虑，1957年的实绩是一百二十万元，难道今年还不如去年吗？经过批评与自我批评，对企业的情况作了充分的调查研究，思想通了，上交利润计划一下子就上升到三百万元。又如农业机械厂，去年生产一台联合收割机要用一千八百个工作日，今年原计划为一千六百多个工作日，后来经过几番摸底算账，只要一千个工作日就行了。这样，这个厂全年就可以抽出六十五万个工作日，来接受其他农业机械的生产任务。
    这位负责人认为，在当前的情况下，要充分挖掘企业潜力，首先要抓的工作，就是要把反浪费的专题鸣放继续深入地开展下去。在厂矿企业中反对浪费的方面是宽广的，除了非生产性的如事业费、生活文化用品、劳动保护用品外，在原材料、工时、工具等方面的浪费情况也是惊人的。因此，反浪费的矛头，应当指向如下的七个方面。
    第一、积压原材料、机物料和设备。仅据目前职工们在反浪费专题鸣放中揭发的材料来看，这方面的数字是相当可观的。无线电厂积压的一种钻头可用四十年；汽车附件厂积压的锉刀可用三十年；国棉三厂积压的一种报表四十年也用不完；电车公司花三万二千元买了一部调度电话，放在仓库里已经一年多了，还用不上它。这个公司有十一根价值三千三百元的水泥杆子，放在东皇城根已经三年了，管理部门一直不知道，直到最近工人提意见，才开始启用。
    第二、工时定额不合理所造成的浪费。汽车附件厂有一种工时定额已超过六倍，仍不作修改。
    第三、由众多的小仓库积压物资所造成的浪费。事实证明，小仓库不仅车间有，工段里也有。如石景山发电厂检修车间的一个工段，只有三十八个人，而积压工具的情况却相当严重。他们的小仓库里有三十八把手锤，实际上有三把就够用了；二十八把活扳子，实际有三把就够了；十四把钢剪，多了十二把；卡钳、水平仪、锯条、大锤等工具，有的积压十多件，有的积压三十多件，有的根本用不上。某厂装配车间清理了一下小仓库，一次就拿出了七万多元的多余物资和工具。
    第四、由于废品次品造成的浪费。国棉三厂在去年三个月之内，就出了三万五千匹次布，还多用了七千九百多公斤的棉纱。南口配件厂前年的废品，占总产量的6％，去年占3％。
    第五、随便报废所造成的浪费。出了废品不设法修复，而随便报废。如电子管厂，从废品钨丝团中找出了一千二百公尺长的价值昂贵的好钨丝。又如无线电器材厂总务科从垃圾堆里，找到了价值四百元的物资。某工厂一个车间的鉴定修理组，提出了向废品库要材料的口号，一次就用这些材料修复了一批价值五千元的齿轮。
    第六、因为设计上的不周到而造成的浪费。如长辛店机车车辆修理工厂设计的拉杆，毛坯四百五十公斤，成品只有二百公斤。这不仅浪费了二百多公斤钢材，而且也浪费了切削时间。
    第七、计划调度不善所造成的浪费。这一点在交通运输部门更为突出。如北京铁路管理局在初步调整了计划和调度工作以后，今年一年，就可以为国家节省三十台火车头。
    最后，这位负责人指出：反对浪费，不仅有巨大的经济意义，而且还有极为深远的政治影响。在企业来说，反对浪费也是一种移风易俗的工作，它使人们养成一种爱护国家财产，随时随地注意节约的风尚，这样就有可能使多快好省的建设方针在企业里逐步地扎下根来。
