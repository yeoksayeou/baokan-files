    Inner Mongolia to Produce Two Million Improved Sheep This Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 26th: This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will improve two million sheep, equivalent to four times the number of sheep improved in the autonomous region since liberation. At present, preparations are actively underway in all aspects.
    In accordance with the growing needs of the country's socialist construction and people's lives, the Autonomous Region will, starting this year, vigorously develop the number of livestock while accelerating the improvement of livestock breeds. On the basis of the existing 300-plus sheep breeding stations, more than 1,500 stations will be added, using Xinjiang, Tsigai, Caucasian, and Altai fine-wool sheep breeds to improve two million sheep. Various measures will also be taken to improve the conception rate and lamb survival rate of improved sheep, striving for a bumper harvest of improved lambs next year. In this way, starting in 1959, the Autonomous Region will be able to provide the country with more fine wool and semi-fine wool year by year.
    In order to successfully complete this task, the Autonomous Region has also transferred a group of technicians, trained more than 3,000 artificial insemination workers from various ethnic groups of farmers and herdsmen, and strengthened the improvement work. At the same time, a large-scale stud farm will be newly built to cultivate a large number of excellent purebred sheep.

    给国家提供更多的细毛和半细毛
    内蒙古今年要生产二百万只改良绵羊
    新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古自治区今年要改良二百万只绵羊，相当于自治区解放以来所改良羊只的四倍。目前，各方面的准备工作正在积极进行中。
    根据国家社会主义建设和人民生活日益增长的需要，自治区从今年开始大力发展牲畜头数的同时，要加速牲畜的品种改良事业。在现有三百多个绵羊配种站的基础上，再增建一千五百多个站，用新疆、茨盖、高加索和阿尔泰等细毛羊种，改良二百万只绵羊。并采取各种措施，尽力提高改良羊只的受胎率和仔畜成活率，争取明年改良羊羔获得丰收。这样，从1959年开始，自治区逐年就能给国家提供更多的细毛和半细毛。
    为胜利完成这项任务，自治区还调配一批技术人员，训练三千多名各民族农牧民人工授精员，加强改良工作。同时，还新建一个大型种羊场，大量培育优良纯种羊只。
