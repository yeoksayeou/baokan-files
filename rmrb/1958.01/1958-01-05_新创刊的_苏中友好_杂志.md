    Newly Published "Sino-Soviet Friendship" Magazine
    Zhao Chun
      "The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has published the first issue of its magazine to celebrate the New Year. The mission of this magazine is to further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries. I believe this is a good and necessary initiative." These are the opening words written by Comrade Khrushchev to the readers of the inaugural issue of "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine, clearly indicating the important significance of the magazine's publication. The inaugural issue, rich in content and diverse in style, vividly expresses the enthusiasm for serving the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. As its first reader, I cannot help but be moved by this enthusiasm.
    Chairman Mao Zedong personally inscribed the title of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine. The cover of the inaugural issue features a photograph of Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Khrushchev, and others at the celebration meeting of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In the photograph, we see Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev standing together so intimately, bringing us infinite happiness and hope. "Needless to say, the foundation of the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp is the unbreakable friendship between the two great nations of the Soviet Union and China." This sentence from the article by Andrei Andreev, the famous state and political activist and Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, deepens our impression.
    "More Precious Than Gold," wrote Kochetov, the author of the novel "The Zhurbin Family" and editor-in-chief of the Soviet "Literary Gazette," under this title, about the friendship he felt during his visit to China. In this article, he clearly distinguished his impressions of China from those of "any tourist from a capitalist country." The author recounted the vibrant construction scenes he witnessed throughout China and the people struggling for a new life, believing that "the strength of People's China is growing year by year" and that "the material well-being of the Chinese people is also improving." He said, "We visited agricultural cooperatives where the public income allowed farmers to dress warmly, eat well, and live well. We saw the nurseries in factories, where healthy and lively children are being educated. Perhaps it's not like this everywhere, but it's the first step on the road to improving the material well-being of the Chinese people." Kochetov firmly believes that "the Soviet Union and People's China will always be friends."
    Indeed, history tells us this. The article about the Chinese volunteers during the Russian Revolution, co-written by writers Dunayevsky and Novogrudsky in the inaugural issue, is a true page of history. The authors gave a lofty evaluation of this page of history, saying, "The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people, forged on the battlefield during the Russian Civil War, has become an example of the close unity of the socialist camp today."
    The report on "Cultural Exchanges Between the Soviet Union and China in 1958" in the inaugural issue showcases the colorful picture of further development of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation to the readers. This issue also reported news of Sino-Soviet friendship activities from various aspects.
    In order to promote the further development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine used more than half of its inaugural issue to elaborate on the achievements of the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction and scientific research, reported on the rich resources and scientific and technological news of the Soviet Union, and introduced the life and labor of the Soviet people and their struggles for the noble cause of building communism. Articles such as "Speaking of Artificial Earth Satellites," "The Kingdom of Diamonds - Yakutia," and "Air Express Aircraft" not only allow readers to understand the strength and advancement of the Soviet Union but also provide readers with modern scientific knowledge in popular language and complete concepts. An elderly milkmaid, Koflova, expressed her love for the new life and optimism in the language of true working people in her article "Our Generation." She described a story: A beautiful girl named Chernova said at a production meeting, "After graduating from ten-year secondary school, I couldn't decide what to do. Later, I became a milkmaid. As for my work, you can comment yourselves. In 1956 alone, I earned 40,000 rubles." Someone exclaimed, "What a wealthy fiancé!" Koflova said in this article, "A milkmaid receives seven or ten years of education, and now our collective farm cadres are such people." At the end of the article, she gave the readers a long-lasting and inspiring encouragement like a poem: "The working people of our country look forward to the future with joy. Every day brings us new happiness, and every year we get closer to communism, just as the morning glow on the Oka River heralds the sunrise."
    L.F. Rogov, the editor-in-chief of "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine, said in the inaugural issue that the task of this magazine is to report on the life of the Soviet Union, introduce the experience and achievements of the Soviet people, and the Soviet people's struggle for world peace, and serve the great cause of further uniting the people of the Soviet Union and China wholeheartedly. This magazine takes expanding Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation and scientific and technological cooperation, and expanding the exchange of experience in this area as its specific tasks. This magazine will elaborate on the issues of Soviet state and party building and introduce Soviet culture, history, customs, and natural wealth. This Soviet friend, Rogov, who has lived and worked in our country for many years, also said that this magazine is also prepared to answer questions raised by readers about the Soviet Union and publish answers from prestigious Soviet experts on Soviet economy and culture, geography and history, science and technology, and other issues.
    The broad masses of Chinese readers have expressed great concern and strong interest in the publication of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine, because it will fully express all the labor creations and brilliant achievements of the Soviet people, so that our people can learn many things and draw infinite wisdom and strength from it.

    新创刊的“苏中友好”杂志
    赵纯
      “苏中友好协会出版了自己的杂志的第一期来庆祝新年，这个杂志的使命是进一步加强我们两国人民的兄弟友谊。我认为，这是一个良好的必要的创举。”这是赫鲁晓夫同志在“苏中友好”杂志创刊号上写给这个杂志的读者的开头几句话，是这样明确地指出了这个杂志的创刊的重要意义。具有丰富内容和多样体裁的创刊号，鲜明地表现出为中苏两国伟大友谊服务的热情。作为它的第一个读者，我不禁为这种热情激动着。
    毛泽东主席亲笔为“苏中友好”杂志题了刊头。杂志创刊号的封面上刊登了毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志等在苏联最高苏维埃十月革命四十周年庆祝会议上的照片，在照片上我们看到毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志那样亲密地站在一起，它给我们带来无限的幸福和希望。“不言而喻，社会主义阵营统一和团结的基础，就是苏联和中国两个伟大国家之间的牢不可破的友谊。”著名的国家活动家和政治活动家——苏中友好协会主席安德烈耶夫的文章中的这句话，加深了我们的印象。
    “比金子更宝贵”，小说“茹尔宾一家”的作者、苏联“文学”报总编辑柯切托夫在这样的标题下，写下了他在中国访问时感受到的友谊。他在这篇文章中以鲜明的立场把自己对中国的印象和
  “任何一个资本主义国家的游客”对中国的印象区别开来。作者追述了他在中国各处见到的蓬勃的建设景象和为新生活而斗争的人们，认为“人民中国的实力逐年增长”，认为“中国人民的物质福利也在提高”。他说：“我们到过农业合作社，社内的公共收入使得农民们穿得暖，吃得饱，住得好。我们看到了工厂的托儿所，健壮活泼的孩子们在这里受着教育。也许不是各处都这样，但它是中国人民物质福利提高道路上的第一步。”柯切托夫坚信：“苏联和人民的中国永远友好。”
    的确，历史是这样告诉我们的。作家杜纳耶夫斯基和诺沃格鲁德斯基在创刊号上合写的关于俄国革命时期的中国志愿兵的那篇文章，就是一页真实的历史。作者对这一页历史给了崇高的评价，他们说：“在俄国内战中，在疆场上结成的苏中两国人民的友谊，到今天已成为社会主义阵营亲密团结的榜样。”
    创刊号上“1958年苏中两国的文化交往”的报道，向读者展示了中苏文化合作进一步发展的丰富多彩的图景。这一期杂志还多方面报道了中苏友好活动的新闻。
    “苏中友好”杂志为了促进苏中友谊和合作的进一步发展和巩固，在创刊号上用一半以上的篇幅阐述了苏联经济、文化建设和科学研究的成就，报道了苏联的丰富资源和科学技术新闻，介绍了苏联人民的生活和劳动以及他们在为建成共产主义的崇高事业中所作的斗争。“话说人造地球卫星”、“金刚石的王国——雅库特”和“空中特快飞机”等文章，不仅使读者从中了解苏联的强大和先进，还以通俗的文字和完整的概念给读者以现代科学知识。上了年纪的挤奶员柯弗洛娃在“我们这一代”一文中，用真正劳动人民的语言表达了她对新生活的热爱和乐观情趣。她描述这样一个故事：一个名叫切尔诺娃的漂亮姑娘在一个生产会议上说：“十年制中学毕业以后，我打不定主意干什么。后来我做了挤奶员。关于我的工作，你们自己可以评论，1956年一年我就赚了四万个卢布。”有人大声称赞了一声：“多么有钱的未婚妻啊！”柯弗洛娃在这篇文章中说：“一个挤奶员都受到七年或十年的教育，现在我们集体农庄的干部都是这样的人。”她在文章结尾像诗句一样给读者以久久难以平静的鼓舞：“我国劳动人民怀着愉快的心情展望着未来，每过一天都有新的幸福带给我们，像奥卡河上的早霞预报太阳的升起一样，每过一年我们都向共产主义更接近了。”
    “苏中友好”杂志总编辑罗果夫在创刊号上说：这个杂志的任务是报道苏联的生活，介绍苏联人民所获得的经验和成就，和苏联人民争取世界和平的斗争，全心全意地为苏中两国人民进一步团结的伟大事业服务。这个杂志把扩大苏中文化合作和科学技术合作，扩大这方面的经验交流作为自己的具体任务。这个杂志将阐明苏联国家和党的建设问题，介绍苏联文化、历史、风俗习惯和天然财富。这位在我国居住和工作过多年的苏联朋友罗果夫还说：这个杂志还准备解答读者提出的关于苏联的问题，登载有威望的苏联专家对苏联经济和文化、地理和历史、科学和技术等问题的解答。
    广大中国读者对于“苏中友好”杂志的出版表示极大的关心和浓厚的兴趣，因为它将把苏联人民的一切劳动创造和光辉成就充分表达出来，使我国人民学到许多东西，从中吸取无限的智慧和力量。
