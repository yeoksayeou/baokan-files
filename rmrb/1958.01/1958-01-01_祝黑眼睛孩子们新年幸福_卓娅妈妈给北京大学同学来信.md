Wishing Happiness to the Black-Eyed Children in the New Year
--Mother Zoya's Letter to Peking University Students

    On the evening of December 25th, a "family letter" from Moscow broke the peace of the fourth-year students of the Russian Department of Peking University, who were immersed in their studies. "A letter from Zoya's mother!" As the good news spread, everyone couldn't contain the excitement in their hearts. This was the third time they had seen a letter from the mother. After reading the letter, everyone couldn't help but recall the scene of meeting this kind mother at Yanyuan a year ago. Before this year's October Revolution Day, the fourth-year students of the Russian Department had written a letter to the mother. This time, the mother's letter congratulated them on the New Year and also talked about the grand occasion of this year's October Revolution Day. My dear young friends:

    I am very happy to receive your letter written in Russian, and I thank you for your heartfelt congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. This year, we celebrated the festival in a particularly grand way. The streets of the capital were decorated with dazzling colorful flags, flowers, and slogans. In the evening, the sky was illuminated by the festive fireworks and fire. On this day, I saw the military parade and the jubilant crowd in Red Square. Every Soviet person's heart was filled with joy for the great victories achieved by their motherland. When we are elated by the victory of socialism, we should not forget that this victory was achieved by all our people through unimaginable labor struggles and vigorous efforts. We should remember that the best sons and daughters of the motherland sacrificed their lives for the happiness of their people and all peace-loving humanity, for the sake of defending this happiness, and for the happy lives of the people of all nations who have embarked on the road of freedom and democracy. We must vigilantly watch the enemy's conspiracies and tricks. We will spare no effort to defend and consolidate lasting peace, as has been stated in the historically significant document – the Peace Manifesto. This manifesto appeals to the conscience of ordinary people all over the world: this manifesto has received the warmest response among all Chinese youth, and among my dear friends, which fills me with even more confidence. You should know that each of you is a youth who is unhesitatingly prepared to engage in creative and constructive labor, and you are always ready to unswervingly defend lasting world peace.

    I congratulate you on your desire to go to the countryside to participate in physical labor in order to help improve agricultural production and to combine the knowledge you have learned with practical work. Because the combination of physical and mental labor can enable socialist society to develop talents in an all-round way.

    I wish you a Happy New Year, and with a mother's heart, I congratulate you on your great new achievements in labor and study in the New Year.

    I embrace my black-eyed children studying at Peking University tightly! And I wish you happiness, health, and a bright future.

    With motherly greetings,

                                          Kasmozyemyanskaya
                           11th, Moscow

    The letter also included a colored portrait of Pushkin, which the students cherished as a precious gift. After receiving the letter, the fourth-year students of the Russian Department prepared to write a letter to thank this mother who is loved by young people all over the world. (Shi Deming)

    祝黑眼睛孩子们新年幸福
    ——卓娅妈妈给北京大学同学来信
    12月25日晚上，一封来自莫斯科的“家书”，打破了正在埋头学习的北京大学俄语系四年级的同学们的平静。“卓娅的妈妈来信了！”喜讯传来，大家都抑制不住内心的激动。这已经是第三次看到妈妈的来信了。当大家看完信后，不由得想起了一年前和这位慈祥的妈妈在燕园见面的情景。在今年十月革命节的前夕，俄文系四年级同学曾写信给妈妈。这次妈妈的来信，一方面是祝贺新年，一方面也谈到今年十月革命节的盛况。我亲爱的年青的朋友们：
    接到你们用俄语写来的信，我非常高兴，感谢你们在十月革命四十周年之际，对我衷心的祝贺。今年的节日，我们庆祝得特别隆重，首都的街道上装饰着鲜艳夺目的彩旗、鲜花和标语。晚上，天空也被节日的礼炮和火花映得通明。这一天，我在红场上看到了军队的检阅和欢腾的人群。每个苏联人的心都为自己的祖国所取得的伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞。当我们为社会主义胜利而欢欣鼓舞的时候，不应当忘记这胜利是我们全体人民以难以想像的劳动斗争和奋发努力争取来的。我们应当记住，祖国最优秀的儿女为了争取自己人民和全体爱好和平人类的幸福，为了保卫这种幸福，为了保卫我们已经走上的自由民主道路的各民族人民的幸福生活，他们献出了自己的生命。我们应当警惕地注视着敌人的阴谋鬼计。我们不遗余力地保卫和巩固持久和平，关于这一点，在具有历史意义的文件——和平宣言中已经说过了。这个宣言对全世界普通人民的良心发出了呼吁：这个宣言在全体中国青年当中，在我亲爱的朋友当中获得了最热烈的反映，这使我更加充满了信心。要知道，你们当中的每一个人都是毫不犹豫地准备着投入创造性和建设性劳动的青年，你们时刻在准备着坚持不渝地捍卫世界持久和平。
    为了帮助提高农业生产，为了把自己学到的知识与实际工作结合起来，你们愿意到农村去参加体力劳动，我祝贺你们有这样的愿望。因为体力劳动和脑力劳动的结合能够使社会主义社会的人材得到全面的发展。
    祝你们新年好，并以一颗母亲的心祝贺你们在新的一年中，劳动和学习取得巨大的新成就。
    紧紧地拥抱我的在北京大学学习的黑眼睛的孩子们！并祝你们幸福健康和前途灿烂。
    致以母亲般的问候
                                          卡斯莫捷扬斯卡娅
                           11日于莫斯科
    在信里面还附一张彩色的普希金画像，同学们把它当作珍贵的礼物保存着。接到来信后，俄文系四年级同学就准备写信感谢这位为全世界青年敬爱的妈妈了。　　（石德明）
