Qingyuan Farmers' Subscription to Public Bonds Exceeds Quota

    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reports that after large-scale socialist education, the farmers of Qingyuan County, Zhejiang Province, have raised their political consciousness and are now launching a high tide of advance subscription to the 1958 economic construction bonds. According to incomplete statistics, as of November 26, 1957, the county had already subscribed to 61,252 yuan of the 1958 public bonds, an increase of 60% compared to the county's subscription to public bonds in 1957. Furthermore, advance payments of 9,211 yuan have already been made, accounting for 15.04% of the already subscribed amount for the 1958 public bonds. In the subscription process, every farmer adheres to the spirit of "thrift and diligence in managing the household," arranging their lives to strive for more subscriptions. Yao Qinglin, a poor peasant member of the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Nankeng Township, was allocated a piece of woodland during land reform. Last year, he earned 1,500 yuan from selling wood. He has already subscribed to 1,200 yuan of the 1958 public bonds.

    The enthusiasm of staff and workers in government offices for subscribing to the 1958 public bonds is also very high. Hu Ruoxi, a comrade from the Qingyuan County Party Committee Office, immediately subscribed to 200 yuan after reading the People's Daily editorial "How Much Public Bonds Are You Preparing to Subscribe to Next Year?"

    Currently, the work of subscribing to the 1958 economic construction bonds is still actively underway in the county. It is estimated that when the entire subscription phase is completed, the subscription amount will be more than double the subscription amount for public bonds in 1957.

    庆元农民认购公债已超出定额
    本报讯　浙江庆元县的农民经过大规模的社会主义教育，提高了政治觉悟，目前已掀起提前认购1958年经济建设公债的高潮。据不完全统计，截至1957年11月26日止，全县已认购1958年公债六万一千二百五十二元，比该县1957年认购公债数增加了60％，并已预缴了现款九千二百十一元，占1958年公债已认购数的15.04％。在认购中，每个农民都本着“节约朴素、勤俭持家”的精神，安排生活，努力争取多购。该县南坑乡灯塔农业社贫农社员姚庆廩，土改时分到一片林木，去年出卖木头收入一千五百元。他已经认购了一千二百元1958年公债。
    在机关职工中认购1958年公债的积极性也很高，中共庆元县委办公室胡儒溪同志，看了人民日报社论“你准备明年认购多少公债”后，立即认购了二百元。
    目前，该县认购1958年经济建设公债工作还在积极进行中。估计整个认购阶段结束时，将比1957年公债认购数增加一倍多。
