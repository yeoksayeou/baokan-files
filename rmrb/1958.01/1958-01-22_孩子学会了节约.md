    Child Learns Thrift
    Carried by Hunan Province, Jiahe County People's Bank, Che Keding

    The child came back from school, before even putting down his bag, he jumped and ran to me, took out a handful of new fen coins from his pocket and put them on the table, his other small hand still reaching into his pocket. I was very surprised: "Where did this child get so much money?" I saw him fumble for a while, and then took out a few bright fen coins from his pocket. He stammered to tell me: this was what he saved from the money I gave him for lunch every day, following the teacher's instructions. The money used to be kept with the teacher, and today he brought it back for me to buy him a pair of gloves. Looking at his expression, with a bit of shyness, and a bit of excitement.

    Facing these fen coins, my thoughts churned like boiling water, it wasn't a matter of how much money, but I was thinking about the new and beautiful things that were emerging in this child. I only give him a few fen each day, and only give him a little more when it's a holiday or when I don't have any fen notes on hand, so that he can eat some snacks at noon; I didn't expect that this child could follow the teacher's instructions and learn to be thrifty. This small saving, though not even a yuan, must have taken the eight-year-old child to overcome many temptations of candy to accumulate to today's amount! This also made me think of the Party Central Committee's call for "increasing production and practicing economy" and "building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift" as deeply rooted in the hearts of the people! I also thank the people's teachers for not only educating our next generation on the meaning of thrift from books, but also gently guiding them to practice it.

    孩子学会了节约
    湖南省嘉禾县人民银行　车克定
    孩子从学校里回来，书包还没有放下，就连跳带跑地走到我面前，从口袋里掏出了一把新分币放在桌上，另一只小手还在往口袋里摸。我很诧异：“这孩子从那儿弄到这么些钱呢？”只见他摸索了一阵，又从口袋里掏出几枚亮晃晃的分币。他结结巴巴地告诉我：这是他遵照老师的嘱咐，从我给他每天的吃中午饭的钱里省下来的，这钱过去存在老师那里，今天拿回来要我给他买一副手套。看他那说话的神气，带着几分害羞，又显着几分兴奋。
    面对着这些分币，我的思潮像水沸了似地上下翻腾，不是钱的多少问题，我想到的是这孩子身上正在产生着一种新的美好的东西。我每天只给他几分钱，要遇着节日或我手边没有分票的时候，才多给一点，好让他在中午时吃点心；没想到这孩子却能遵照老师的教导，学会了节约。这虽然不上一元钱的小积蓄，该让一个八岁的孩子战胜了多少次糖果的诱惑，才能积成今天这个数字啊？这又使我联想到党中央提出的“增产节约”和“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的号召是多么地深入人心！我也感谢人民教师不仅从书本上教育我们的后一代认识节约的字义，还能循循地诱导他们身体力行。
