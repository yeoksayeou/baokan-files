Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia is Developing
By Our Correspondent Yang Yi

The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party put forward the slogan of completing socialist construction during the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) at its plenary session in October last year. In the past few months, this inspiring call has become a huge driving force for encouraging the Czechoslovak people to move forward.

Following the Central Committee’s plenary session, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party published a letter to the whole party and all working people in October, requesting a nationwide discussion on the implementation of the resolutions of the National Party Congress in 1956 and the further tasks of socialist construction. This discussion is of great significance. Its purpose is to mobilize the people of the whole country to strive to improve the efficiency of the national economy and accelerate the pace of socialist construction. The focus of the discussion is the principles and plans proposed by the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party at its October plenary session regarding the reform of industrial organization, management, planning and financial work.

Now, this discussion is coming to an end, and the annual meetings of party organizations at all levels and specialized sub-committees are carefully dealing with the results of the working people's discussions. In more than two months, millions of working people held tens of millions of meetings and put forward a large number of useful criticisms and suggestions.

On what basis was such a large-scale mass movement launched?

To illustrate this point, it is necessary to briefly review the basic situation and important measures of Czechoslovakia's economic work in the past year.

In the first year of the second Five-Year Plan (1956), Czechoslovakia achieved considerable economic success. Industrial production increased by 9.5% compared with the previous year, agricultural production also increased by 3.4% compared with 1955, and the volume of foreign trade increased by 16%. The overall economic situation is booming, but there are also some problems and difficulties in the work that need to be solved.

The first problem is the insufficient supply and excessive consumption of raw materials. Czechoslovakia is a highly developed industrial country, and some important materials need to rely on imports. However, since the end of 1956, due to the influence of the international situation, there have been certain difficulties in the supply of raw materials. At the same time, the raw material consumption plans for the first half of 1956 and 1957 were exceeded. This situation cannot but hinder the further development of production and the rapid growth of national income.

Secondly, the rate of increase in living standards exceeds the rate of increase in production. Since 1953, due to the active adoption of various measures by the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, the people's monetary income and personal consumption have grown rapidly, so the rate of production increase and national income increase has not kept up. For example, compared with 1956, the national income increased by 7.3% in 1957, while the residents' personal monetary income increased by 7.2%, and personal consumption increased by 9.1%. In this way, the people's increasing purchasing power has formed increasing pressure on the market and the national economy.

Another problem is the proportion between accumulation and consumption in the distribution of national income. In recent years, due to vigorous capital construction, expansion of domestic raw material bases, and acceleration of agricultural mechanization, there have been higher requirements for national investment. At the same time, continuously improving people's living standards and increasing various cultural and welfare facilities also require large sums of money. On the other hand, the growth rate of national income has slowed down in recent years. This has also caused certain difficulties in the country's finances.

In response to these situations, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held two plenary sessions in February and October 1957 to discuss economic issues and put forward the policy of "improving the efficiency of the entire national economy." The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party believes that the rate of improvement in people's living standards cannot be slowed down, and the original requirement to increase personal consumption by one-third during the second Five-Year Plan cannot be shaken; but at the same time, it is necessary to vigorously accelerate the growth of production and national income, so that the national income increases faster than the national production, and that the improvement of living standards adapts to the growth of labor productivity.

According to this policy, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government have made a series of major efforts in the economic field over the past year. On the one hand, they mobilized and tapped all the resources and potential of the domestic economy, vigorously increased production and practiced economy, emphasized saving raw materials, reducing costs, developing new technologies, and launching labor competitions, so that production can be "more, better, and more economical." At the same time, they vigorously carried out the agricultural cooperativization movement, established new unified agricultural cooperatives, and expanded the original cooperatives, in order to change small-scale production into large-scale production, so as to lay the foundation for rapidly improving agricultural production. National investment in capital construction was reduced by one-tenth. In terms of foreign trade, through strengthening economic cooperation and mutual assistance with socialist countries, through signing long-term trade contracts, and implementing multilateral trade, to expand foreign trade and improve profitability.

The above-mentioned measures have achieved considerable results in the past year. According to statistics up to the end of November 1957, industrial production increased by 9.8% compared with the same period of the previous year, agricultural production increased by 2%, and national income increased by 7.3%. Through the first stage of review of capital construction, more than 5.3 billion crowns (the name of the Czech currency) have been saved. In 1957, 1.2 billion crowns more goods were produced than the original plan. The achievements of the labor competition were also the best in recent years in 1957, with more than 2 million people participating in the first half of the year alone. The agricultural cooperativization movement has made great progress, with more than 2.6 million new members and more than 1.2 million hectares of cultivated land added in one year. Socialist components have accounted for 64% of the country's cultivated land area. The volume of trade with socialist countries has also generally increased.

These achievements are of great significance for improving the efficiency of the entire national economy, but the "Red Right Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, pointed out in an editorial on January 8 this year: "A decisive shift has not yet been achieved in improving the efficiency of the national economy last year, and one of the main tasks this year is to complete this shift."

In order to fundamentally solve the problem of improving the efficiency of the national economy, one of the important links is to further improve the level of current economic management work and give full play to the superiority of the socialist system.

At present, Czechoslovakia's economic management system can reflect the superiority of the socialist system, and the leap forward progress in all aspects since liberation fully illustrates this point. However, due to the further development of socialist construction, some of the original forms of economic planning and management cannot fully meet the needs of the new situation, and therefore certain defects have appeared between individual links. This is manifested in: the central government is too concentrated in management, and the institutions of the central ministries and general administrations are large and overlapping. In terms of planning, the central government controls annual plans too much and too rigidly. In terms of finance, enterprises have too little authority and it is difficult to carry out large-scale construction and reforms. Enterprises are not responsible for the sales of products, so they are not concerned enough about technological innovation; at the same time, because the issuance of bonus payments only considers the completion of the total output value indicators, enterprises also tend to ignore variety and quality indicators and do not pay attention to saving raw materials. These defects more or less affect the improvement of the efficiency of the entire national economy.

The principles and plans for reforming industrial organization, management, planning and financial work proposed by the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party at its plenary session in October last year were formulated to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings and fundamentally improve the level of economic management. The basic principles and central content of this plan are:

1. Change the organizational form of enterprises so that each enterprise becomes an independent production unit and economic accounting unit. Such enterprises will be formed or jointly formed by merging enterprises producing the same products. At the same time, the institutions of the central ministries will be greatly reduced, the general administration level will be basically abolished, and most of the streamlined cadres will be transferred to strengthen enterprises. The main tasks of the central ministries in the future will only be to formulate long-term plans for the development of their departments, solve important issues related to economic policies, and conduct effective supervision and inspection of their subordinate enterprises.

2. Strengthen the planning of national economic development. In the future, the central government will mainly formulate long-term plans for ten to fifteen years. On this basis, it will formulate five-year plans, and each enterprise will formulate its own annual production plan according to the five-year plan indicators and the main tasks of annual production, and then the central government will make an overall balance.

3. Fully use the principle of material incentives to manage the economy so that enterprises have the greatest concern for their own operating results. Enterprises will have the right to expand production and can own a certain amount of funds based on the level of profits of the enterprise itself. The operating losses and product sales are basically the responsibility of each enterprise itself.

It is not difficult to see that the complete implementation of this plan will, on the one hand, enable the central government to more effectively concentrate leadership and management of the national economy, and ensure the proportionate and planned development of various departments; on the other hand, it will also encourage the production enthusiasm of enterprises and employees, and promote them to tap potential and improve operations.

Because this reform involves a wide range of issues and touches on very complex issues, it must be carried out cautiously and properly arranged; therefore, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party submitted this principle plan to the whole party and the whole people in October last year for extensive discussion. The discussion was conducted under the direct and specific leadership of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Before the discussion, 700 outstanding staff members were dispatched from the central government to the 19 states across the country to first unify the ideological understanding of cadres at the state level, and then work with the cadres of each state to form working groups to explain the content of the open letter of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the significance of the national discussion to grassroots cadres and working people. Specialized small committees for collecting and processing mass opinions were established from the Party Central Committee to various levels of organizations, units, and enterprises. The discussion became the most concerning event for the people of Czechoslovakia since October last year.

It can be seen from the discussion that the vast majority of the masses wholeheartedly support this economic reorganization plan. They believe that this plan is in line with the actual situation and national traditions of Czechoslovakia. The discussion also showed the political awareness and initiative of the working people. The opinions they put forward are mostly of a high level. This discussion was a good socialist education for the working people, and it also enabled them to further participate in national leadership and economic management.

The discussion was conducted in two stages. The first stage was to mobilize and conduct general discussions; the second stage began on November 15 last year, and turned to discuss the specific plan for economic reorganization. One of the significant features of this discussion is that the useful suggestions put forward by the masses have been dealt with and resolved in a timely manner within their own units; only those important, universal, or nationally significant issues are submitted to higher authorities or the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party for overall solution.

The discussion greatly promoted the democratic atmosphere of enterprises, encouraged the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the working people, and also stimulated the development of production and the improvement of work. Employees are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy, and members of agricultural cooperatives have also proposed guarantees for completing the five-year production increase target in four years.

Now, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party will hold a meeting in the near future based on the discussion results of the national working people to determine the economic reorganization plan, and will begin to implement it from April, and it is expected that this major change will not be fully completed until next year.

This year is the third year of Czechoslovakia's second Five-Year Plan, which is a crucial year. At the same time, this year is also the tenth anniversary of the Czechoslovak people's victory day - the February event, and the fortieth anniversary of Czechoslovakia's national independence from Austro-Hungarian rule and the establishment of the Republic. In order to welcome the 11th National Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party scheduled to be held in June this year, the Czechoslovak working people will respond to the call of the trade union to carry out labor competitions and strive to increase national production by 8.8%, agricultural production by 12%, national income by 9.8%, and personal consumption by 5.4% this year.

The 11th National Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party will specifically discuss the issue of building socialism in three years (during the second Five-Year Plan) on the basis of summarizing past achievements. In order to complete socialist construction, it is first necessary to complete the reorganization of the national economy, further improve the overall national economic effect, and thoroughly realize socialist industrialization; secondly, it is necessary to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. This year, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government will accelerate the pace of cooperativization on the basis of last year's cooperativization upsurge, change small-scale production into large-scale production, so as to rapidly increase agricultural production, strive to complete the target of increasing agricultural production by 30% stipulated in the second Five-Year Plan one year in advance, and enable socialist components to account for 80% to 85% or more of the cultivated land area in 1960, occupying an absolute dominant position in the countryside. Finally, it is also necessary to complete the political and ideological socialist revolution and strengthen political and ideological education work. The "Red Right Daily" said it well in its editorial on January 4: "Completing socialist construction not only means building the necessary economic conditions, especially completing the socialist transformation of agriculture, but also means raising the socialist awareness of the broadest strata of the people, so that in the process of successfully completing socialist construction and in the process of building communism in the future, the people's awareness can become the decisive driving force for social progress."

These are the glorious tasks and goals of struggle placed before the Czechoslovak people. Now the Czechoslovak working people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, are advancing bravely with full confidence to complete socialist construction!

    捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设在发展中
    本报记者　杨翊
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在去年10月全会上提出了在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）内完成社会主义建设的口号。几个月来，这一动人心弦的号召已经成为鼓舞捷克斯洛伐克人民向前迈进的巨大动力。
    紧接着中央全会，捷共中央在10月份公布了致全党和全体劳动人民的信，要求对1956年全国党代表会议决议的执行情况和社会主义建设的进一步任务，开展全民性的讨论。这一讨论具有重要意义。它的目的是动员全国人民为提高国民经济效率、加速社会主义建设步伐而努力。讨论的重点是捷共中央10月全会上提出的关于改革工业组织、管理、计划和财务工作的原则方案。
    现在，这一讨论即将结束，正由各级党组织的年会和专门性的小组委员会，对劳动人民的讨论成果慎重加以处理。两个多月中，成百万的劳动人民举行了成千万次集会，提出了大量有益的批评和建议。
    这样一个大规模的群众运动是在怎样的基础上开展起来的呢？
    为了说明这点，我们有必要简单回顾一下一年来捷克斯洛伐克经济工作的基本情况和重要措施。
    捷克斯洛伐克在第二个五年计划的第一年（1956年），在经济上取得了不小的成就，工业生产比前一年增加了9.5％，农业生产也比1955年提高了3.4％，对外贸易额增加16％。整个经济情况是蒸蒸日上的，但工作中也还面临一些需待解决的问题和困难。
    第一个问题是原材料供应不足和消耗过多。捷克斯洛伐克是工业高度发达的国家，某些重要物资有一部分需要依靠进口。但从1956年底以来，由于国际局势的影响，原材料供应产生一定困难。与此同时，1956年和1957年上半年的原材料消耗计划又都被超过。这种情况不能不阻碍生产的进一步发展和国民收入的迅速增长。
    其次是生活水平提高的速度超过了生产增长的速度。从1953年以来，由于捷共和政府积极采取各种措施，人民的货币收入和个人消费增长得很快，因而生产提高和国民收入增加的速度有些跟不上。如1957年同1956年比较，国民收入增加7.3％，而居民的个人货币收入却提高了7.2％，个人消费增长了9.1％。这样，人民不断增加的购买力形成了对市场和国民经济越来越大的压力。
    还有一个问题是国民收入分配中积累和消费之间的比例。近年来，由于大力进行基本建设、扩大本国原料基地和加速农业机械化，对国家投资有了更高的要求。同时，不断提高人民生活水平和增加各种文化福利设施，也需要大笔资金。而另一方面，国民收入增长速度近年来有所减慢。这也造成了国家财政上的一定困难。
    针对着这些情况，捷共中央在1957年2月和10月先后两次召开中央全会讨论经济问题，提出了“提高整个国民经济效能”的方针。捷共中央认为人民生活水平提高的速度不能减慢，在第二个五年计划内把个人消费提高三分之一的原定要求不可动摇；但同时必须大力加速生产和国民收入的增长，使国民收入比国民生产增加得更快，使生活水平的提高同劳动生产率的增长相适应。
    根据这个方针，捷共和政府一年来在经济方面作了一系列重大的努力。一方面动员和挖掘本国经济的全部资源和潜力，厉行增产节约，强调节约原材料，降低成本，发展新技术，开展劳动竞赛，使生产做到“更多更好更省”。同时大力开展农业合作化运动，建立新的统一农业合作社和扩大原有的合作社，为变小生产为大生产，以便为迅速提高农业生产打下基础。在基本建设上减少了十分之一的国家投资。在对外贸易方面，通过加强同社会主义国家的经济合作与互助，通过签订长期贸易合同、实行多边贸易，来扩大对外贸易和提高赢利。
    上述措施一年来已收到了不小的成效。根据到1957年11月底为止的统计，工业生产比前一年同期增加了9.8％，农业生产增加了2％，国民收入增长了7.3％。通过对基本建设的第一阶段的审核，已可节约出五十三亿多克朗（捷币名）。1957年还比原订计划多生产了十二亿克朗的商品。劳动竞赛的成绩1957年也是几年来最好的一年，单是上半年就有二百多万人参加。农业合作化运动更是取得巨大进展，一年中新增了二百六十多万社员和一百二十多万公顷耕地，社会主义成份已占有全国耕地面积64％。对社会主义国家的贸易额也普遍有所增长。
    这些成就对提高整个国民经济效率具有重要意义，但捷共中央机关报“红色权利报”在今年1月8日社论中也指出：“在提高国民经济效率方面去年尚未取得决定性的转变，今年的主要任务之一就是完成这个转变。”
    为了从根本上解决提高国民经济效率的问题，重要环节之一是进一步提高现时经济管理工作的水平，充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性。
    目前捷克斯洛伐克经济管理体系是能体现社会主义制度的优越性的，解放以来各个方面的飞跃进展充分说明了这一点。但由于社会主义建设的进一步发展，原有的某些经济计划管理形式就不能完全符合新形势的需要，因而在个别环节之间出现了某些缺陷。这表现在：管理上中央集中得多了些，中央各部和各总管理局机构庞大、重叠。计划编制方面，中央对年度计划统得太多、太死。财务方面，企业权限太小，很难进行较大规模的建设和改革。企业对产品销路不负责任，因而对技术革新不够关心；同时由于颁发超额奖金只考虑到生产总值指标完成的情况，也使企业产生忽视品种和质量指标，不注意节约原材料的偏向。这些缺陷或多或少都影响到整个国民经济效率的提高。
    捷共中央在去年10月全会上提出的改革工业组织、管理、计划和财务工作的原则方案，就是为了克服上述缺点、根本性地提高经济管理水平而制定的。这一方案的基本原则和中心内容是：
    一、改变企业的组织形式，使每个企业都成为独立的生产单位和经济核算单位。这样的企业将由生产相同产品的各企业合并组成或联合组成。同时中央各部机构将大大缩小，总管理局一级基本撤销，精简出来的干部大都下放加强企业。中央各部今后的主要任务将只是制定本部门发展的长远规划，解决有关经济政策的重要问题和对所属企业进行有效的监督和检查。
    二、加强国民经济发展的计划性。今后中央主要制定十年到十五年的远景计划，在这基础上再制定五年计划，而由各企业根据五年计划指标和年度生产的主要任务来制定本企业的年度生产计划，然后由中央加以总的平衡。
    三、充分运用物质刺激原则管理经济，使企业对本身的经营效果具有最大的关心。企业将有权扩大生产，并可根据企业本身利润的高低，拥有一定数量的资金。经营的亏损和产品的销售也基本上由各企业自己负责。
    不难看出，这一方案的完整实现，将一方面使中央能更有效率地集中领导和管理国民经济，保证各部门按比例有计划地发展；另一方面也鼓舞各企业和职工的生产积极性，促使他们挖掘潜力，改善经营。
    由于这项改革牵涉的面很广泛，触及的问题也十分复杂，必须谨慎从事，妥善安排；因此，捷共中央在去年10月份把这一原则方案提交全党和全体人民，进行广泛讨论。讨论是在捷共中央直接和具体领导下进行的。讨论前从中央派遣了七百名优秀的工作人员到全国十九个州，首先统一州一级干部的思想认识，然后会同各州干部组成工作组，向基层干部和劳动人民解释捷共中央公开信的内容和全民讨论的意义。从党中央到各级组织、各单位和各企业都成立了专门搜集和处理群众意见的小组委员会。讨论成为去年10月份以来捷克斯洛伐克全国人民最关心的事件。
    从讨论中可以看出绝大多数群众是衷心拥护这一经济改组方案的。他们认为这个方案符合捷克斯洛伐克的实际情况和民族传统。讨论也显示了劳动人民的政治觉悟和主动精神。他们提出的意见多具有高度水平。这次讨论是对劳动人民的一次很好的社会主义教育，也使他们进一步参预了国家领导和经济管理工作。
    讨论是分两个阶段进行的，第一阶段进行动员和一般性讨论；第二阶段从去年11月15日开始，转而讨论经济改组的具体方案。这次讨论的显著特色之一是，群众提出的有益建议，都在本单位内及时得到了处理和解决；只有那些重要的、带普遍性的或有全国意义的问题，才送交上级机关或捷共中央去统筹解决。
    讨论大大发扬了企业的民主气氛，鼓舞了劳动人民的政治热情和生产积极性，也刺激了生产的发展和工作的改进。职工们正以增产节约的实际行动响应党中央的号召，农业合作社社员们也纷纷提出了四年完成五年增产指标的保证。
    现在，捷共中央将根据全国劳动人民的讨论成果，在最近期间开会确定经济改组方案，并从4月份起开始付诸实施，预计要到明年才能全部完成这一重大变革。
    今年是捷克斯洛伐克第二个五年计划的第三个年头，是具有关键性的一年。同时今年也是捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利日——二月事件的十周年，是捷克斯洛伐克从奥匈帝国统治下获得民族独立、建立共和国的四十周年。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民为迎接预定在今年6月召开的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一届代表大会，将响应工会号召，开展劳动竞赛，争取今年内使国民生产增加8.8％，农业生产增长12％，国民收入增加9.8％，个人消费提高5.4％。
    捷共第十一届代表大会将在总结过去成就的基础上，具体讨论在三年内（第二个五年计划期间）建成社会主义的问题。为了完成社会主义建设，首先需要完成国民经济改组工作，进一步提高整个国民经济效果，彻底实现社会主义工业化；其次需要完成农业的社会主义改造，捷共和政府今年将在去年合作化高潮的基础上，加速合作化的步伐，变小生产为大生产，以迅速增加农业生产，争取提前一年完成第二个五年计划所规定的农业增产30％的指标，并使1960年时社会主义成份能占有耕地面积的80％到85％以上，在农村中居于绝对优势的地位。最后，还需要完成政治上和思想上的社会主义革命，加强政治思想教育工作。“红色权利报”1月4日社论说得好：“完成社会主义建设，这不仅是意味着要建成必需的经济条件，特别是完成农业的社会主义改造，而且，还意味着要提高最广泛阶层人民的社会主义觉悟，以便在胜利地完成社会主义建设的过程中以及以后建设共产主义的过程中，人民的觉悟能成为社会进步的决定性推动力。”
    这些就是摆在捷克斯洛伐克人民面前的光荣任务和奋斗目标。现在捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民正在捷共领导下，满怀信心地为完成社会主义建设而奋勇前进！
