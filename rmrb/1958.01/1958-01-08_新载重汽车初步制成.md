    New Truck Initially Manufactured

    (Our dispatch) The First Automotive Works recently trial-produced a new type of vehicle—the CA-11A truck.

    This truck is an improved version of the Liberation truck, based on domestic conditions and the experiences of using Liberation trucks in various regions over the past two years. Its power and economy have been significantly improved. At the same time, with the same load capacity, the weight of the vehicle itself has been reduced by about 500 kilograms. The new truck's engine uses an aluminum cylinder head, increasing the horsepower from 90 to 110. The rear axle of the chassis has been improved, which saves materials and is easy to maintain. The gearbox has been changed from the original five-speed to a four-speed, and the clutch has also been changed from a double-disc to a single-disc, which not only reduces weight but also makes driving more flexible. The total volume of the cargo bed has also increased by 0.49 cubic meters. In addition, the cab and water tank have also been improved.

    Currently, the automobile factory is preparing to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of this new type of vehicle.

    新载重汽车初步制成
    本报讯　第一汽车制造厂最近试制出一种新品种汽车——CA—11A型载重汽车。
    这种汽车是根据国内条件和两年来各地使用解放牌汽车的情况，把解放牌汽车加以改进制成的。它的动力性及经济性有显著提高。同时，在载重吨位不变的情况下，车身自重减轻了五百公斤左右。新车的发动机采用铝制汽缸盖，马力由九十匹提高到一百一十匹。底盘部分后桥经过改进，既能节省材料又便于保养。变速箱由原来的五级排档改为四级排档，离合器也由双片改为单片，不仅减轻了重量，驾驶起来更加灵便。车箱的总容积也增大了零点四九立方公尺。此外，驾驶室、水箱等也有所改进。
    目前，汽车厂正准备对这种新型汽车的性能作全面鉴定。
