Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 23rd: In the past few days in Chongqing, an average of nearly half of the city's total population has been involved daily in the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests." On January 18th, 800,000 cadres, workers, soldiers, and urban residents participated in the blitz to eliminate the Four Pests; on January 19th, this number reached 890,000. According to preliminary statistics, these two days saw the extermination of more than 81,500 rats, more than 20,900 sparrows, the digging up of more than 1,650 jin of fly pupae, and the removal of more than 118,500 dan of garbage, sludge, and weeds.

In the past few days, the enthusiasm of Chongqing's government cadres and young students for eliminating the Four Pests has been very high, reversing the previous phenomenon in health campaigns where government offices lagged behind the streets, and cadres lagged behind the masses. In the central urban area alone, more than 140 government units have organized blitz teams and groups to attack the "Four Pests" separately. Cadres and students have also gone to the suburbs to work with farmers to wipe out the "Four Pests."

In order to compete with cadres and students, the enthusiasm of urban residents for eliminating the Four Pests has become even higher. Most of the residents in more than 30 street offices in the central urban area have participated in the campaign to eliminate the Four Pests and clean up the environment.

According to the arrangements of the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, Chongqing will also conduct several more such large-scale encirclement and annihilation activities against the "Four Pests" on January 25th and in February and March.

    重庆扭转机关卫生落后的现象
    干部和城市居民展开竞赛
    据新华社重庆23日电　重庆市这几天来平均每天有占全市总人口将近半数的人卷入以除“四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动。18日全市参加除四害突击的干部、职工、部队和城市居民是八十万人，19日达到八十九万人。据初步统计，这两天共扑灭老鼠八万一千五百多只，麻雀二万零九百多只，挖出蝇蛹一千六百五十多斤，清除垃圾污泥杂草十一万八千五百多担。
    这几天重庆市的机关干部、青年学生除四害的劲头很大，扭转了以往卫生运动中机关落后于街道，干部落后于群众的现象。单是市中心区，这几天就有一百四十多个机关单位的干部组织了突击队和小组，分头出击“四害”。干部和学生们还到郊外去同农民一起歼灭“四害”。
    为了和干部、学生们竞赛，城市居民的除四害热情更加高涨。市中心区三十几个街道办事处的绝大部分居民都投入了除四害及打扫环境卫生运动。
    根据市爱国卫生运动委员会的安排，重庆市在1月25日和2、3月内，还要进行多次这种大规模的围歼“四害”活动。
