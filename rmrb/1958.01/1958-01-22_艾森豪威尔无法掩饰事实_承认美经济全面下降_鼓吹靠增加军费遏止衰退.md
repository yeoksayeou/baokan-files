Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th—U.S. President Eisenhower today submitted his annual economic report to the U.S. Congress. This report acknowledges that the U.S. economy is in a recession, and that this recession will continue to develop. The report clearly states that the U.S. government's main reliance is on massively increasing military spending, strengthening arms expansion and war preparation, and increasing government expenditures to inject a stimulant into the sluggish U.S. economy.

The report indicates that this recession came earlier than expected, and the impact has been more severe than officials anticipated. The report acknowledges overproduction, stating that the market demand not keeping pace with the development of production capacity is the main reason for this recession.

The report points out that obvious signs of recession appeared in the summer of last year, and by the fourth quarter of last year, it had developed into a "decline in comprehensive economic activity." The report says that due to a decrease in orders for new equipment, and because industry and commerce were "generally adopting cautious policies" due to concerns about economic prospects, corporate purchases decreased, and the amount of inventory accumulation declined. At the same time, "further declines in (commercial) sales and reductions in (industrial) accumulated unfilled orders have led to cuts in production plans." Due to reductions in both the employed population and income, retail sales have also declined. The report says that the six billion dollar drop in the gross national product in the fourth quarter of last year compared to the third quarter, calculated on an annual basis, reflects this change.

The report says that the employed population in December of last year (excluding agriculture) also decreased by 2% compared to the same summer, and the number of unemployed people (according to Department of Commerce figures, has already increased to 3,374,000) reached 5.2% of the total labor force. Personal income decreased by two billion dollars in the fourth quarter of last year, and personal consumption expenditures decreased by one billion dollars.

The economic report also points out that the decline in U.S. foreign trade in the second half of last year was also a factor contributing to the economic recession. It says that due to economic difficulties in other capitalist countries last year and the disappearance of some temporary factors that had promoted increased U.S. exports, the amount of U.S. exports has declined from the level of the first half of last year.

When discussing estimates of the current economic situation, the report tries to make people believe that "the decline in business activity is not necessarily long-term," but it has to admit that "based on the materials of new orders and contracts, and based on the information about the investment intentions of business people," the decline in expenditures on factories and equipment will be extended into 1958. On the other hand, the economic disadvantages of other capitalist countries (including their declining economic activity, dollar foreign exchange difficulties, and U.S. reductions in their imports) causing a reduction in demand for the United States will also have a "contractionary impact" on U.S. economic activity.

The report then puts forward some measures to overcome the economic recession, which focuses on increasing military expenditure. It says that the U.S. now spends militarily, accounting for 30% of the U.S. national product. In the future, it is also necessary to continue to strengthen armaments work "regardless of cost." At the same time, the report also advocates that it is necessary to continue to increase the expenditures of state and local governments at a rate of three billion U.S. dollars per year in recent years to support economic activity. The report makes it clear that it is necessary to "offset" the reduction in business investment with "the inevitable increase in expenditures on defense procurement projects and the increasing expenditures of national and local governments." The report also mentioned taking measures to lower interest rates and relax loans to stimulate the economy.

The report emphasizes the importance of expanding foreign exports to the U.S. economy, and in this regard, it proposes a number of measures to expand U.S. exports, with the main content being the extension of the "Trade Agreements Act" for five years.

### 艾森豪威尔无法掩饰事实  承认美经济全面下降  鼓吹靠增加军费遏止衰退

    艾森豪威尔无法掩饰事实
    承认美经济全面下降
    鼓吹靠增加军费遏止衰退
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天向美国国会提出一年一度的经济报告。这份报告承认美国经济处在衰退之中，而这种衰退还将继续发展。报告明白表示，美国政府的主要依靠是要用大量增加军费、加强扩军备战和增加政府开支的办法来给萎靡不振的美国经济注射强心针。
    报告表明，这次衰退来得比预期的要早，而所受到的打击比官员们预料的还要严重。报告承认生产过剩，市场的需求跟不上生产能力的发展是出现这次衰退的主要原因。
    报告指出，明显的衰退迹象是在去年夏季出现的，到去年第四季发展成为“全面经济活动的下降”。报告说，由于新设备的订单减少，而且工商业因为担心经济前景而“普遍采取慎重的政策”，因此企业的进货减少，存货积累数额下降。同时，“（商业方面的）销售额的进一步下降和（工业方面）积存的未完成的订货单的减少使得生产计划受到了削减”。由于就业人口和收入都有减少，商品零售额也下降了。报告说，按年率计算，去年第四季的国民生产毛值比第三季下降了六十亿美元正是反映了这种变动。
    报告说，去年12月的就业人口（农业除外）也比同年夏季减少了2％，失业人数（据商业部数字，已经增加到三百三十七万四千人）达到全部劳动力的5.2％。个人收入在去年第四季减少了二十亿美元，个人的消费开支减少了十亿美元。
    经济报告还指出，美国去年下半年对外贸易的下降也是促成经济衰退的一个因素。它说，由于去年其他资本主义国家经济也发生困难和一些曾经促使美国输出增加的暂时因素的消失，美国出口数额已经从去年上半年的水平下降了。
    报告在谈到对当前经济局势的估计时，力图使人相信“企业活动下降不一定是长期的”，但是却不得不承认“根据新的订货和合同的材料，以及根据关于企业界人士的投资打算的情报”来判断，对工厂和装备的支出的下降将要延长到1958年。而另一方面，其他资本主义国家的经济不利因素（包括它们的经济活动下降，美元外汇困难和美国削减了它们的进口）造成对美国需求的减少，也将对美国经济活动起一种“收缩的影响”。
    报告接着提出一些克服经济衰退的措施，其中着重谈到增加军费开支。它说，美国现在军事性开支，占美国国民生产的30％。今后还要“不计代价”地继续加强军备工作。同时，报告还主张必须继续以最近几年来每年增加三十亿美元的速度来增加州和地方政府的支出来支持经济活动。报告明白表示，要以“防御采购项目的必然增加的开支以及国家和地方政府不断增加的开支”来“抵销”企业投资的减少。报告也提到采取降低利率和放宽贷款来刺激经济。
    报告强调扩大对外输出对美国经济的重要性，在这方面它提出要求以延长“贸易协定法”五年为主要内容的扩大美国输出的一些措施。
