    Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference for Peace and Justice
    Tao Xijin
    (Summary of a report given at the 11th meeting of the Standing Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society on January 2, 1958)
    The Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference was held in Damascus, the capital of Syria, from November 7 to 11, 1957. Our Chinese legal workers' delegation attended this conference.
    The Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference was originally proposed by the Sixth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in May 1956. In January 1957, the Arab Lawyers Union decided to hold the conference in Damascus, Syria. The Damascus Lawyers Union was then responsible for the preparations and consulted with relevant parties to determine the date, agenda, and other arrangements for the conference.
    The preparation time for this conference was quite short, but as many as twenty-five delegations arrived in Damascus to attend the conference. As early as January 1955, legal workers from various Asian countries successfully held a conference in Calcutta, India; however, this was the first time that legal workers from Asia and Africa gathered together to discuss issues of common concern to the people of Asia and Africa.
    It should be particularly pointed out that this conference was held in the capital of Syria. Just as the Syrian people, united as one, were engaged in a heroic struggle to defend national independence and oppose the US imperialists' conspiracy to launch armed aggression using Turkey and Israel, the Asian-African legal workers chose such a frontline in the struggle against imperialism—Damascus—as their meeting place. This meant that the Asian-African legal workers stood with the struggling Arab people, raising the banner of peace and justice, and marching towards the lawless and sinful imperialists.
    The Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference was conducted in an atmosphere of unity and friendship. The results of the conference showed that although the participating representatives came from regions with different political situations and countries with different social systems, and had various different political views and legal opinions, they were united on the general goal of striving for peace and justice. The conference not only completely contradicted the "prophecy" of some people who thought that there would be quarrels and no results, but it also exceeded the achievements expected by some of our friends. The conference adopted many important resolutions, which profoundly reflected the new development of friendly cooperation among the people of Asia and Africa since the Bandung Conference, further clarified the principles of the Bandung Conference from a legal perspective, expressed the lofty aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa in pursuit of peace and justice, and specifically and forcefully supported the current struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism and colonialism. It should be pointed out that the achievements of the conference were the result of the joint efforts of the representatives of the participating countries, and were also inseparable from the strong support of the Syrian government, especially the valuable labor devoted by the host of the conference—the Damascus Lawyers Union—in preparing for the conference.
    The conference gave us a deep impression: it put forward unusually clear slogans against imperialism and colonialism, reflecting the new development of the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa to defend peace and justice.
    The Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference unanimously agreed that imperialism and colonialism are the enemies of peace and justice, and the source of all kinds of crimes (war, massacre, torture, stifling nationalism, and enslaving people, etc.).
    The Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference's clear and firm slogan against imperialism and colonialism prominently reflects the confidence of the people of Asia and Africa in the victory of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Because not only from the victorious example of the anti-imperialist struggle of our Chinese people, but also from the fact that the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt failed not long ago, the people of Asia and Africa have clearly seen that as long as everyone unites and persists in the struggle, imperialist aggression can be completely defeated.
    This conference also educated our legal workers: legal struggle must be combined with the great political struggle of the world's people to defend peace and oppose aggression. This once again exposes the long-exposed lie of law being above politics.
    Another deep impression the conference gave us is that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated by China and India and affirmed by the 1955 Bandung Conference, have become generally recognized new principles of international law and an important weapon for the people of all countries to strive for peace and oppose aggression.
    The convening of this Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference, as Mr. Malki, the Secretary-General of the conference, said in his report on the preparations for the conference at the opening session, "It is only a continuation of the Bandung Conference in the legal field; at the same time, it is a practical application of the principle of peaceful coexistence advocated by the Bandung Conference."
    Therefore, the central idea of this Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The discussions at the conference on issues such as nationalization, imperialism and colonialism, human rights, as well as aggression and its legal consequences, world peace, and nuclear explosions, were actually a continuation of the Bandung Conference in the legal field, all embodying the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    In order to defend the principle of peaceful coexistence, which is the cornerstone of the Five Principles, the conference held that all imperialist acts are incompatible with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The conference advocated that all countries in the world should quickly reach agreements on banning the manufacture, use, and testing of nuclear weapons, reducing armaments, abolishing military blocs and military treaties, and withdrawing troops and abolishing military bases from foreign territories. At the same time, because active neutrality contains the affirmation of the principle of peaceful coexistence, the conference supported the policy of active neutrality.
    Regarding the principle of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. This principle actually contains two concepts: mutual respect for sovereignty and mutual respect for territorial integrity. So-called sovereignty also means that any country and nation has the absolute right to independence and autonomy. The Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference condemned colonialism, which violates national sovereignty, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and declared it a criminal act; reaffirmed its belief in the universal and permanent importance of the right to national self-determination and demanded that all nations deprived of this right immediately and unconditionally restore this right. The conference solemnly declared that only when France immediately recognizes Algeria's independence and negotiates with the Algerian National Liberation Front can the Algerian issue be resolved; only by implementing the principle of national self-determination can the Cyprus issue be resolved; only by unifying and making Cameroon independent can it meet the hopes of the Cameroonian people and the principles of international law. The conference also sternly condemned the actions of US, British, and French imperialists in establishing military bases in foreign countries and forcing some small and weak countries to sign unequal treaties, considering this a gross violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. On the issue of nationalization, the conference unanimously supported Egypt's legitimate action of nationalizing the Suez Canal in accordance with the principle of sovereignty.
    In order to further clarify the principle of non-aggression, the conference carefully discussed the definition of aggression and its legal consequences. On this issue, the conference basically adopted the definition of aggression that the Soviet Union had proposed to the United Nations. However, in order to avoid causing too much controversy over some specific concepts, the final agreement did not distinguish between direct, indirect, economic, and ideological acts of aggression, but realistically listed various different forms of aggression as seventeen types. The conference also declared that any country that carries out or instigates aggression, regardless of whether its aggressive purpose is achieved or not, should bear full responsibility in accordance with international law, and that any country's support for a country that has been invaded is legitimate.
    As for the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, we know that it is an extension of the principle of sovereignty, and it is a traditional principle of international law. Only when countries adhere to this principle can they guarantee their sovereignty and improve international relations. However, in this regard, the most prominent problem now is the infamous "Eisenhower Doctrine," which uses various pretexts and means to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and it is the most vicious new type of colonialism. This is especially familiar to the people of Asia and Africa, especially the people of the Middle East. Therefore, the conference exposed it as a typical manifestation of imperialism, a serious act of interference in internal affairs, and a serious act of aggression.
    Regarding the principle of equality and mutual benefit, everyone knows that at the Bandung Conference, it was extended into two principles, namely, the principle of recognizing the equality of all races and all countries, large and small, and the principle of promoting mutual benefit and cooperation. At this Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference, in addition to condemning differential treatment based on race or skin color, in the resolution on unequal treaties and military alliance treaties, it solemnly declared that the right to national equality, like the right to national independence and sovereignty, is a fundamental and inviolable right; unequal treaties, due to the obviously unequal obligations borne by the two parties to the treaty, are a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, and countries forced to sign such treaties have the right to abolish them. The conference held that aggressive military alliance treaties such as the North Atlantic Treaty, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty are all used to make weak countries subservient to strong countries and constitute a threat to world peace. In order to promote peaceful coexistence, the conference also suggested that countries take active steps to expand international trade, increase mutual visits, develop cultural exchanges, and strengthen economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
    These resolutions of the Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference were made based on the new development of the international situation since the Bandung Conference and are in line with the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa; therefore, it is obviously a concrete implementation of the principles of the Bandung Conference and a further clarification of these principles from a legal perspective.
    Imperialism and the Five Principles always run counter to each other. Therefore, the process of striving for the realization of the Five Principles must also be the process of the world's people's struggle against imperialism, and resolutely defending and continuing to clarify these five principles from a legal perspective is naturally the sacred responsibility of all legal workers.
    The main task facing all legal workers in Asian and African countries and other countries in the world who cherish peace and justice is to defend and clarify the various principles of peaceful coexistence from a legal perspective, which are in line with the wishes of all good people in the world, support the freedom and independence of all nations, oppose and prevent the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and their colonial policies, and maintain lasting world peace, thereby leading mankind to a bright and happy future. This is the glorious and arduous common task of legal workers of all countries. In order to accomplish such a task, legal workers must have further unity and cooperation. This requires not only the unity and cooperation of legal workers in our Asian and African regions, but also the broader unity and cooperation of legal workers around the world; not only to consolidate and develop the close unity and cooperation between legal workers, but also to consolidate and develop the unity and cooperation between legal workers and all forces that love peace and justice.
    Here, we do not need to shy away from the fact that at this Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference, the political and legal views of friends from countries with various different social systems were not completely consistent. Therefore, there were more or less disputes on some of the issues discussed at the conference, and even the disputes on some issues were quite intense. However, in fact, it was precisely because of these disputes that the conference was held even better. There are mainly two points here that are worth our pointing out:
    First, despite the disputes over different opinions and different concepts on some issues, there was a consensus on the overall goal of defending peace and opposing imperialism; and subjectively, the disputed issues were raised under this overall goal and premise; the attitude of the disputes was also frank, rational, and mutually respectful. Therefore, such disputes are obviously disputes that are conducive to the cause of peace and justice, and beneficial disputes that are conducive to consolidating unity. Therefore, for all the disputes, everyone followed the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and after frank consultation and discussion inside and outside the meeting, almost all of them finally smoothly reached a consensus agreement.
    Second, all legal concepts are produced in actual struggle and tested by actual struggle. Among the international friends we have contacted, some are internationally renowned jurists who have experienced two world wars. They sincerely said that in participating in the great struggle for peace and justice, they increasingly feel that the old traditional international law, although many of its principles can still be applied, many concepts must be abandoned and replaced by new principles of international law. For example, the old international law on issues related to sovereignty actually maintained the sovereignty of capitalist powers, but despised the sovereignty of small and weak countries and the right to national self-determination; for example, regarding treaty issues, the old international law recognized the validity of unequal treaties, which is obviously unreasonable; for example, regarding war issues, the old international law did not distinguish between just and unjust wars, and thus was essentially serving imperialist aggression. Obviously, these outdated concepts must be replaced by new content such as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in order to meet the requirements of the current era. Facts have proved that disputes over different concepts in law can be easily resolved as long as they touch on the specific analysis of the current struggle. Because the only criterion for distinguishing whether a law can serve peace and justice is actual life and actual struggle.
    Under the banner of peace and justice, the vast majority of legal workers in the world can unite and cooperate. The key lies in the fact that legal workers must pay better attention to the principles and methods of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual consultation, and mutual respect in their joint work; at the same time, legal workers of all countries should maintain more contact, mutual visits, and exchange of culture and academic ideas on weekdays, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and thus gaining close unity and cooperation.

    为和平与正义而斗争的亚非法律工作者会议
    陶希晋
    （1958年1月2日在中国政治法律学会常务理事会第十一次会议上的报告摘要）
    1957年11月7日到11日在叙利亚首都大马士革举行了亚非法律工作者会议，我们中国法律工作者代表团参加了这个会议。
    亚非法律工作者会议，原是1956年5月国际民主法律工作者协会第六届大会建议召开的。1957年1月阿拉伯律师联盟作出了在叙利亚大马士革举行这个会议的决定。大马士革律师工会随即负责筹备，并征询有关方面决定了召开会议的日期、议程和其他各种安排。
    这个会议的筹备时间相当短促，但先后赶到大马士革出席会议的代表团有二十五个之多。早在1955年1月，亚洲各国的法律工作者，曾在印度的加尔各答圆满地举行过一次会议；但亚非两洲的法律工作者聚会一堂来讨论亚非人民共同关切的问题，这还是第一次。
    特别应当指出，这个会议是在叙利亚首都举行的这一事实。正当叙利亚人民举国一致为捍卫民族独立、反对美国帝国主义者利用土耳其和以色列阴谋发动武装侵略而进行着英勇斗争的时候，亚非法律工作者选择了这样一个反对帝国主义斗争的前哨阵地——大马士革，作为自己的集会地点，这就意味着亚非法律工作者是同斗争中的阿拉伯人民在一起，举起和平与正义的旗帜，向无法无天的罪恶的帝国主义者进军。
    亚非法律工作者会议是在团结友好的气氛中进行的。会议的结果表明，与会各代表虽然来自不同政治情况的地域和不同社会制度的国家，具有各种不同的政治见解和法律观点，但是在争取和平与正义的总目标上是一致的。会议同某些人认为将争吵一番无结果而散的“预言”不仅完全相反，而且它还超过了我们有些朋友预期的成就。会议通过了许多重要决议，深刻地反映了万隆会议以来亚非人民友好合作的新发展，从法律方面进一步阐明了万隆会议的各项原则，表达了亚非人民追求和平与正义的崇高意向，并且具体地、有力地支持了亚非各国人民当前反对帝国主义与殖民主义的斗争。应当指出，会议获得的这些成就，是与会各国代表共同努力的结果，也是同叙利亚政府的大力支持，特别是会议主人——大马士革律师工会为筹备这次会议所付出的极有价值的劳动分不开的。
    这次会议给予我们一个深刻的印象，就是：它提出了异常鲜明的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的口号，反映了亚非人民捍卫和平与正义的斗争的新发展。
    亚非法律工作者会议，一致认为：帝国主义和殖民主义是和平与正义的敌人，是各种罪行（战争、屠杀、酷刑、扼杀民族主义和奴役人民等）的渊源。
    这次亚非法律工作者会议提出鲜明的、坚决的反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的口号，突出地反映了亚非人民对反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争的胜利信心。因为不仅从我们中国人民反帝斗争的胜利榜样上，而且从不久以前英、法和以色列侵埃战争失败的事实上，亚非人民已清楚地看到：只要大家团结一致，坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略是完全可以击败的。
    这次会议，还教育了我们法律工作者：法律斗争必须同世界人民保卫和平、反对侵略的伟大的政治斗争结合起来。这再一次地揭穿了早经揭穿过的法律超政治的谎言。
    这个会议给予我们另一个深刻的印象是：中印两国所倡议而又被1955年万隆会议所肯定的关于和平共处的五项原则，已经成为公认的新的国际法原则，已经成为各国人民争取和平、反对侵略的重要武器。
    这次亚非法律工作者会议的召开，诚如会议秘书长马尔基先生在开幕大会上报告会议筹备经过时所说：“它只是万隆会议在法律方面的继续；同时也是对万隆会议所提倡的和平共处原则的实际适用。”
    因此，这次亚非法律工作者会议的中心思想，就是和平共处的五项原则。会议上关于国有化问题、帝国主义和殖民主义问题、人权问题，以及侵略及其法律上的后果、世界和平和核子爆炸等问题的讨论，实际上都是万隆会议在法律方面的继续，都体现了和平共处的五项原则。
    为了捍卫作为五项原则基石的和平共处的原则，会议认为一切帝国主义的行为是同和平共处的五项原则不相容的。会议主张全世界各国，应当迅速地就禁止核子武器的制造、使用和试验，裁减军备，取消军事集团和军事条约等达成协议，并从外国领土上撤退军队和取消军事基地。同时，因为积极中立包含着对于和平共处的原则的确认，所以会议支持了积极中立的政策。
    关于互相尊重领土主权的原则。这一原则实际上包含着互相尊重主权和互相尊重领土完整的两个概念。所谓主权，也即意味着任何国家和民族都有独立自主的绝对权利。亚非法律工作者会议谴责了侵犯国家主权、民族主权和领土完整的殖民主义，把它宣告为犯罪行为；重申了对于民族自决权以及对于这个权利的普遍、永久的重要性的信念，并且要求对所有被夺去这个权利的民族立即无限制地恢复这个权利。会议庄严地宣告：只有法国立即承认阿尔及利亚的独立，并且同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线进行谈判，才能解决阿尔及利亚问题；只有实行民族自决原则，才能解决塞浦路斯问题；只有使喀麦隆统一和独立，才符合喀麦隆人民的希望和国际法的原则。会议还严正地指责了美、英、法帝国主义者在外国建立军事基地、迫使一些弱小国家签订不平等条约的行为，认为这是粗暴地侵害了他国的主权和领土的完整。在国有化的问题上，会议一致支持了埃及根据主权的原则将苏伊士运河收归国有的正当行动。
    为了进一步阐明关于互不侵犯的原则，会议慎重地讨论了侵略的定义及其法律上的后果问题。对于这问题，会议基本上采取了苏联曾向联合国提出过的关于侵略的定义。但是为了避免在若干具体概念上引起过多的争论，最后协议对直接、间接、经济、思想等侵略行为不加区分，而把各种不同方式的侵略行为实事求是地列举为十七种。会议并且宣告：任何实行或者唆使侵略的国家，不论其侵略目的既遂、未遂，都应当依照国际法负完全的责任，而任何国家对于被侵略国家的支持是合法的。
    就不干涉内政的原则来说，我们知道它就是主权原则的引伸，它是传统的国际法原则。只有各国奉行这一原则，才能保障各国的主权，有利于国际关系的改善。可是，在这方面，现在最突出的问题就是臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”，它用各种借口和各种手段对别国内政横加干涉，它是最凶恶的新型的殖民主义。这一点，对于亚非人民，特别是中近东的人民，分外熟悉。因此，会议揭穿它是帝国主义的典型表现，是严重的干涉内政的行为，也是严重的侵略行为。
    关于平等互利的原则，大家知道，在万隆会议上曾被引伸为两个原则，即承认一切种族、一切大小国家平等的原则，和促进相互利益与合作的原则。这次亚非法律工作者会议，除谴责了根据种族或者肤色的不同而实行的差别待遇外，在关于不平等条约和军事同盟条约的决议中，庄严地宣告：国家平等的权利，正如国家独立和主权的权利一样，是基本的和不可侵犯的权利；不平等条约，由于订约两方所负担的义务显然不平等，是对于联合国宪章的彰明较著的违反，被迫签订这种条约的国家有权予以废弃。会议认为侵略性的军事同盟条约如北大西洋公约、巴格达条约、东南亚条约都是使弱国屈从强国，并且构成对世界和平的威胁。为了促进和平共处，会议还建议各国采取积极步骤，扩大国际贸易，增加互相访问，发展文化交流，并且在平等互利的基础上加强经济合作。
    亚非法律工作者会议的这些决议，都是根据万隆会议以来国际形势新的发展而作出的，并且符合于当前亚非人民的共同愿望；因而它显然也就是万隆会议各项原则的具体贯彻，并且是从法律方面对这些原则的进一步阐明。
    帝国主义和五项原则总是背道而驰的。因此，争取五项原则实现的过程，也必然就是世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的过程，而从法律方面坚决地捍卫与继续阐明这五原则，也自然就是一切法律工作者的神圣责任。
    摆在亚非各国以及世界其他各国的一切珍视和平与正义的法律工作者面前的任务，主要就是从法律方面，捍卫与阐明符合全世界一切善良人们意愿的和平共处的各项原则，支持一切民族的自由和独立，反对和制止帝国主义者的侵略阴谋及其奉行的殖民主义政策，维护世界持久和平，从而使人类走向光明和幸福的未来。这是各国法律工作者的光荣而艰巨的共同任务。为要完成这样的任务，法律工作者就必须要有进一步的团结和合作。这不仅要有我们亚非地区的法律工作者的团结和合作，而且要有全世界法律工作者的更广泛的团结和合作；不仅要巩固与发展法律工作者之间的亲密的团结和合作，而且要巩固和发展法律工作者与一切爱好和平与正义的力量的团结和合作。
    在这里，我们无须讳言，在这次亚非法律工作者会议上，反映来自各种不同社会制度国家朋友们的政治法律观点，是并不完全一致的，因此，在会议所讨论的一些问题上，或多或少是曾有争论的，甚至对有的问题的争论，还相当激烈。但是，实际上正由于有了这些争论，才使会议开得更好。这里主要有两点值得我们
  指出：
    第一，尽管对有些问题有不同意见和不同概念的争论，但是在保卫和平与反对帝国主义的这一总目标上，却是一致的；而且主观上都是在这个总目标和总前提下提出的争论问题；争论的态度也是坦率的、说理的、互相尊重的。因此，这样的争论，显然是有利于和平与正义事业的争论，有利于巩固团结的有益的争论。也因此，对所有的争论，大家本求同存异的方针，经过会内会外的坦率的协商和讨论，几乎没有一个不是最后顺利地取得了一致协议。
    第二，一切法律观念是在实际斗争中产生而又被实际斗争所考验的。在同我们接触过的国际朋友当中，有些是经历了两次世界大战的国际上的著名法学家，他们诚挚地说到，在参与为和平与正义的伟大的斗争中，越来越感到旧的传统的国际法，其中虽有不少原则还可以适用，但有许多概念已必须抛弃而代之以新的国际法原则。例如，旧的国际法对有关主权问题，实际上是维护资本主义强国的主权，而是蔑视弱小国家的主权和民族自决的权利的；又如关于条约问题，旧的国际法承认不平等条约有效，这显然是不合理的；再如关于战争问题，旧的国际法不区别正义与非正义的战争，因而在本质上它是为帝国主义侵略服务的。显然，这些陈腐的概念，已必须要用如像和平共处五原则的新内容来代替，才能符合现时代的要求。事实证明，法律上不同概念的争论，只要接触到当前斗争的具体分析时，也就容易迎刃而解。因为鉴别法律是否能为和平与正义服务的唯一标准，就是实际生活和实际斗争。
    在和平与正义的旗帜下，世界上绝大多数的法律工作者是能够团结与合作的，关键在于我们法律工作者在共同工作中，必须更好地注意求同存异、彼此协商和互相尊重的方针和方法；同时各国的法律工作者，平时应保持更多的接触，相互访问，相互交流文化与学术思想，从而增进相互的了解，并由此获得亲密的团结和合作。
