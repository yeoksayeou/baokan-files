    Rural Letters
    Sha Ou
      What can express my joy on this first night? Dear, I feel like I've flown out of a cage. The sky has become bigger, and there are more stars. I truly love this place I've longed for. There's not a sound from next door; everyone is sound asleep, including that big auntie who's like a mother. Guess what's exciting my heart? Tomorrow morning, I'll be entering the classroom of labor for the first time.
      Collecting Manure
      Before the morning glow could even dye the east red, I was already out the door, carrying my manure basket. I carefully searched along the road, wishing a thousand carts would pass by. A group of children quietly followed me, their laughter making me momentarily flustered; was my posture wrong, or what? The little teacher explained the first chapter of labor to me.
      Building Canals
      In the canal we're building, the soft water is so clear; this section of the canal connects to that section, like countless searchlights interwoven in the sky. Dear, I'm telling you, no one in our team has fallen behind! The aching back and legs are long gone. I'm happy, I'm very busy.
      Cooking
      The comrades who dug the canal have returned, and the rice pot is still bubbling away; you don't know how anxious I am, with no one to help me at this moment. The room is filled with loud laughter—the millet rice has been cooked into a pot of soup! It's a little embarrassing, but it'll be fine soon. I failed today, but I'm sure to pass tomorrow!
      After Dinner
      The children came again after dinner, sitting on the warm kang. The oil lamp flickers, illuminating their chubby faces. I teach them to sing, and the songs resonate throughout the village. They don't laugh at me anymore; they only laugh heartily when they hear stories.

    农村来信
    沙鸥
      第一夜用什么能说出我的舒畅？亲爱的，我像飞出了笼子一样。天变大了，星星也多了，我真喜爱这久久想望的地方。隔壁已没有一点声音，熟睡了，那像母亲一样的大娘。你猜，是什么激动着我的心？明晨，将第一次走进劳动的课堂。
      拣粪朝霞还来不及染红东方，我就出门了，背着粪筐，顺着大路我细心找寻，多想有千辆大车走过身旁。一群孩子悄悄跟着我，他们的笑声使我一时心慌；是动作不对，还是什么呢？小先生给我讲了劳动的第一章。
      修渠在我们修的水渠里，软软的水多么清亮；这一段渠连着那一段渠，像无数照空灯交织在天上。亲爱的，我告诉你，我们的队无人落榜！腰酸腿疼早过去了，我快乐，我很忙。
      煮饭挖渠的同志们回来了，饭锅还在咕咕咕地响；你不知道我多么着急，这时谁也没法来帮忙。满屋都是哈哈大笑，小米饭煮成了一锅汤！有点难为情，很快就好了，今天不及格，明天准考上！
      晚饭后孩子们又来了，坐在暖炕上。油灯闪呀闪的，照着胖胖的面庞。我教他们唱歌，歌声响遍了村庄。他们不笑我了，听故事才笑声琅琅。
