    Add a Brick to Socialist Construction!
    Cheng Huimin, Railway Worker's Family Member
    My home is in Botou City, Hebei Province. My family has nine people, with seven children, four of whom are in school. Before the 1956 wage reform, my husband's monthly salary was 50 yuan, averaging just over 5.5 yuan per person per month. This was a tight budget even in Botou City. With so many people and such a low income, I deeply felt that managing the household well, easing my husband's burden, and allowing him to focus on his work was my way, as a worker's family member, of contributing to our country.
    I make a detailed spending plan every month. The family needs 230 jin of grain each month, buying 200 jin of coarse grains and 30 jin of fine grains, costing 28 yuan in total; oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, soap, and alkali cost 4 yuan; coal and firewood 3 yuan; groceries 9 yuan; water bill 1 yuan; the remaining 5 yuan is for my husband and children's membership fees, subscriptions, pocket money, etc. Because my husband never encounters any difficulties in his family life, he concentrates on his work. He has never been absent in the past four years and constantly receives full attendance awards and task completion awards. The bonuses are saved for buying clothes and public bonds. Because I pay attention to thrift everywhere, carefully calculating everything, 50 yuan can support our nine-person family with food, clothing, and even savings. Not only have we never asked for public assistance, but from 1954 to 1956, my family also bought 70 yuan of public bonds.
    After the wage reform, my husband's salary increased. Last autumn, my eldest daughter also became a temporary teacher on the railway. Their combined monthly income is 90 yuan. Although income has increased, I will never forget the hard days of the past. I feel that we should still live frugally, save more money, and save more to support national construction. I allocate 56 yuan per month for living expenses, plus 10 yuan for my husband and daughter to buy some necessary items, deposit 14 yuan in the bank each month, put 1 yuan into the economic mutual aid group, and constantly send 10 or 8 yuan to the elderly in the countryside.
    I often think that in everyday life, if you don't start with the big picture and focus on the small details, paying attention to saving every little bit is impossible. In terms of food, the principle is to ensure my husband eats well and the whole family is full. We usually eat more coarse grains and less fine grains, and often mix in some substitute foods. Last year, in February and March, we bought a total of 150 jin of sweet potatoes and gourds. In April, I also organized more than 40 railway workers' families to gather wild vegetables, collecting more than 1,500 jin in total. When cooking, I cook only as much as we need, not letting the children snack. In this way, my family saves 45 jin of grain each month (the supply quota is 275 jin). I always buy the cheapest vegetables, taking the time to cook them deliciously in different ways. When eating Chinese cabbage, I first stew or pickle the stems for my children and me, and stir-fry the tender hearts for my husband. This arrangement ensures my husband eats well without spending too much money. Every few days, I make some meat buns or dumplings for my husband to improve his diet. The whole family improves their diet once a week, mostly by making coarse grains in a refined way. No matter how I vary the meals, the grocery bill never exceeds 10 yuan per month. In terms of daily necessities, I also try to save as much as possible. For example, for household coal, I buy coal dust and make my own briquettes, and 300 jin of coal dust is enough for a month. When cooking, I only turn the stove on high when needed, and immediately seal it with small cinders when not in use; I pick out the unburnt black cores from the coal briquettes and burn them again, and the burnt cinders can be sifted and reused. In autumn, I lead the family members to sweep leaves and burn them together, saving 50 jin of coal per month. In terms of water use, I also encourage the two older children to carry water themselves after school, saving money to buy stationery for the children, which not only saves money but also pleases the children and cultivates their habit of diligence and thrift. I also save as much as possible on clothing, mending and altering. Last year, I only used 72 chi of the 258 chi of cloth coupons I had, saving 186 chi. I bought hairdressing tools, and I do all the haircuts for the whole family myself, saving several yuan each month.
    Sometimes, some family members advise me, "Your income has increased, you should improve your life. Aren't you afraid of becoming a capitalist by saving money?" But I always think this way: now is the period of national construction, and a lot of funds are needed. Our country is big and has a weak foundation. To build socialism, every family must be diligent and thrifty, adding strength to socialism. When buying public bonds in 1957, my husband and I discussed: what actions can we take to support socialism? Even if we buy a brick for the country, it will show our good intentions! In the end, we decided to use the 100 yuan we had saved over the years, three yuan and two yuan at a time, to buy public bonds. I also bought five yuan in the family dormitory. The chairman of the trade union didn't believe my family could buy so many public bonds and even came to my house to investigate if we had any difficulties. Later, when they saw that we had taken out our bank savings and bought public bonds all at once, they even put up a big-character poster praising us. Now, not counting the savings from participating in the economic mutual aid group, my family has already saved 84 yuan.

    给社会主义建设添一块砖瓦！
    铁路工人家属　程惠敏
    我家住河北省泊头市，全家九口人，有七个孩子，四个孩子都已上学。1956年工资改革以前，我丈夫每月工资是五十元，平均每人每月的生活费是五元五角多，这在泊头市来说生活也是够紧的。在这种人多收入少的情况下，我深深感到：安排好家庭生活，减轻丈夫的家庭负担，使他安心工作，也就是我这个工人家属对咱们国家的一分心意。
    我每月都作细致的开支计划。全家每月需粮二百三十斤，买二百斤粗粮，三十斤细粮，共用二十八元；油、盐、酱、醋、胰子、碱等四元，煤、柴三元，菜金九元，水费一元；余下的五元给丈夫、孩子交会费、团费，订杂志、零用等。丈夫因为家庭生活上从没有遇到什么困难，工作精力集中，四年来从没缺过勤，不断地得到全勤奖和完成任务奖。奖金留着添衣物，买公债等。由于处处注意俭省，精打细算，五十元钱九口人过活，有吃有穿，还有储蓄。不仅从来没有要过公家补助，从1954年到1956年，我家还买了七十元公债。
    工资改革后，丈夫工资提高了。去年秋天大女儿在铁路上又当上临时教员。他父女俩每月总收入九十元。收入虽然增多了，但我永远忘不了过去的苦日子，觉得无论如何还是应当节约过日子，多攒钱，多储蓄，好支援国家建设。每月拿出五十六元作为生活费，另外给他父女两人十元添些必要用品，每月往银行存十四元，入经济互助组一元，还不断地给农村的老人捎个十元八元的。
    我经常这样想，家常过日子，如果不从大处着眼，小处着手，一点一滴注意节省是不行的。在吃上是本着让丈夫吃好、全家吃饱的原则，平时多吃粗粮少吃细粮，还时常掺些代食品。去年2、3月共买山芋、葫萝卜一百五十斤。4月间我又组织了四十多户铁路工属去打野菜，共打了一千五百多斤。在做饭上吃多少，做多少，不让孩子吃零食。这样，我家每月节约粮食四十五斤（供应指标是二百七十五斤）。吃菜总是拣便宜的买，回家费些功夫，变着样把它做的好吃。吃大白菜，先把菜帮炖着或是腌起来我和孩子吃，嫩菜心给丈夫炒着吃。这样安排使丈夫吃的好，也用不了多少钱。隔几天给丈夫弄点肉包个饺子，改善一下生活。全家是每周改善一次，大都是粗粮细做。不论怎样调着样吃，每月超不过十元菜金。在日常需用上，也是尽量节约。如家常用煤，都是买煤沫自己团煤球，一个月三百斤煤沫就够了。做饭时才把炉火通旺，不用火立即用小渣封上；没烧透的煤球将黑心拣出来再烧，烧下的煤焦子筛筛还可以再用。秋天我带动家属们扫树叶搭着烧，每月能省下五十斤煤。用水上也都是鼓励两个大孩子下学后自己去抬，省下的钱给孩子们买文具，既省钱，孩子又喜欢，也培养了他们勤俭的习惯。穿衣上也是能省就省，翻翻改改，去年二百五十八尺布票只用了七十二尺，节省了一百八十六尺。我买了理发用具，全家人的理发都是我自己动手，每月也省下好几元钱。
    有时，有的家属劝我说；“你们收入增多了，生活该改善一下了，你存着钱不怕发展成资本家呀？”可是我总是这样想：现在国家正在建设时期，需要大量资金。咱们国家大，家底空，要建设社会主义，就要每一个家庭都勤俭持家，给社会主义增添力量。1957年买公债时，我和丈夫合计：拿什么行动支援社会主义呢？那怕给国家买一块砖瓦添上，也表示我们一点心意！最后我们决定将几年来三元、两元积攒起来的一百元钱都买了公债，我在家属宿舍还买了五元。工会主席都不信我家能买这么些公债，还特地上我家来调查有没有啥困难。后来见我们把银行存款取出来一下都买了公债，还给我们贴了表扬的大字报。现在我家不算参加经济互助组的存款，又已储蓄了八十四元。
