Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 17th. Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhao Zukang reported on Shanghai's greening plan at the 13th meeting of the Municipal People's Committee on the 15th. This year, Shanghai will plant six million trees, a number exceeding three times the total number of trees planted in Shanghai in the eight years since liberation. In order to transform Shanghai into a city of "lush greenery and blooming flowers" within the Second Five-Year Plan, Shanghai will launch a mass tree-planting campaign after the Spring Festival this year. The greening of the suburbs will mainly be based on the principle of "collectively planted and collectively owned, self-planted and self-owned," relying on various agricultural cooperatives to utilize the open spaces along rivers, beside houses, along roads, and around villages, focusing on the development of fruit trees, planting four million trees. The urban area will combine the elimination of the four pests and the improvement of environmental sanitation, and according to the principle of "collectively planted and collectively owned, self-planted and self-owned," utilize the open spaces in workers' new villages, sidewalks, in front of and behind houses, or in factories, schools, hospitals, and private gardens to plant two million trees with ornamental value, achieving "every family plants trees, every household grows flowers, everyone maintains them, and every tree survives."

    上海今年要植树六百万株
    五年内将变成绿树成荫、百花争妍的城市
    新华社上海17日电　上海市副市长赵祖康15日在市人民委员会第十三次会议上报告了绿化上海的规划。今年上海要植树六百万株，这个数目超过解放八年来上海植树总数的三倍。为了使上海在第二个五年计划内变成“绿树成荫、百花争妍”的城市，上海将在今年春节后展开一个群众性的植树运动。郊区的绿化，主要是根据社种社有、自种自有的原则，依靠各农业社利用河旁、宅旁、道旁和村旁等空地，以发展果树为主，种植四百万株树木。市区要结合除四害和改善环境卫生，根据集体种集体有、自种自有的原则，利用工房新村、人行道、宅前屋后或工厂、学校、医院和私人庭园的空地，种植有欣赏价值的树木二百万株，做到“家家种树、户户栽花、人人养护，棵棵成活”。（附图片）
