Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Japanese Friendship Delegation to China, which attended the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and then visited China, and some members of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held a symposium in Beijing on the 30th. From the Japanese side, the participants in the symposium were: Takashi Ichinose, head of the Japanese Friendship Delegation to China; Chokichi Yamada, Kenji Mimura, deputy heads; Unpei Saito, secretary-general; Takehito Makinouchi, Hiroo Miyagawa, Giichiro Yoneyama, Tadashi Mizusawa, Tadao Kota, Yoshihisa Kajitani, Kisuke Miyakoshi, Shinichi Okubo, Tokuo Akiyama, Ken Hideshima, and Tasuku Asano; From the Chinese side: Burhan and Chu Tunan, deputy heads of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, Wang Li, Wang Guangying, Deng Guang, Dapu Sheng, Zhu Ziqi, Wu Han, Jin Zhonghua, Tang Mingzhao, Qi Mugang, Han Youtong, Yang Chunsong, Dong Xin, and Zhao Puchu.

At the symposium, representatives from both sides exchanged views on various issues of mutual concern in a friendly atmosphere. First of all, both sides unanimously affirmed the significant achievements of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, from December 26, 1957, to January 1, 1958, and believed that this conference made a historic contribution to strengthening the friendly unity of the people of Asian and African countries and promoting the common cause of the people of Asian and African countries in upholding national independence and striving for lasting world peace. Representatives from both sides unanimously expressed their willingness to strive to realize the declaration and various resolutions of the conference.

Mr. Takashi Ichinose, head of the Japanese Friendship Delegation to China, read a statement from the Japanese Friendship Delegation to China at the symposium:

　　After the conclusion of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, more than 500 representatives from 45 countries who attended the conference are all striving to convey the strong desire for peace, independence, and friendship to the masses in their respective countries.

　　At this moment, fifteen representatives from the Japanese delegation organized a friendship delegation and were honored to be invited by the Asian Solidarity Committee and the Peace Committee of the Soviet Union and China to visit the two countries and promote peace and friendship.

　　Since arriving in China, the Japanese Friendship Delegation to China has visited various facilities and had cordial talks with people from all walks of life in China. Although some members of the delegation have visited China several times or studied Chinese issues, they were indeed surprised by the magnificent development and construction of China, expressed their admiration, and were deeply grateful for the enthusiastic hospitality of the Chinese side. At the same time, thinking of the past and present situation in Japan, we are ashamed.

　　Due to the erroneous policies of the Japanese militarists and Zaibatsu, Japan brought indescribable disasters to China and has not yet made any compensation. However, the Chinese people still extend unlimited understanding and friendship to the Japanese people, which deeply moves us.

　　The Japanese Friendship Delegation to China, while feeling the importance of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo, especially feels that the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the only China, the People's Republic of China, supported by 650 million people, is an indispensable condition for peace not only in Asia but also in the whole world. In view of this, the Japanese Friendship Delegation to China is willing to strive to achieve the following goals:

　　1. Strive to realize the declarations and various resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference;

　　2. Strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges;

　　3. Support the summit conference and promote its early realization;

　　4. Demand an immediate and complete ban on the testing and use of nuclear weapons;

　　5. Strive to consolidate world peace.

After Mr. Takashi Ichinose read the statement, Burhan, the deputy head of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, made a speech:

　　Today, we are very happy to be able to meet again in Beijing with the fifteen Japanese friends who came to our country to visit after attending the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and exchange opinions. On behalf of the Chinese delegation attending the conference, I warmly welcome all friends.

　　We welcome the statement just read by Mr. Takashi Ichinose.

　　The Chinese people fully support the declaration and various resolutions adopted by the Cairo Conference, and are willing to realize the declaration and resolutions of the conference, to implement the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to oppose imperialism, colonialism, the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty, and racial discrimination, for the purpose of striving for and defending the independence and happiness of the people of Asian and African countries and lasting world peace, the Chinese people are willing to unite with the Japanese people and the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people in the world to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and make unremitting efforts to achieve greater victories in our common cause of independence, peace, friendship, and unity.

　　The Chinese people have always advocated an immediate ban on the testing and use of nuclear weapons and universal disarmament. We fully support the Soviet Union's recent rational proposals on banning nuclear weapons testing, achieving disarmament, and holding a summit conference of major powers. However, at present, the U.S. war forces are stepping up the implementation of their war preparation policies and infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of other countries, and the aggressive acts of expanding atomic and missile bases in various parts of the world endanger world peace and security, which we Chinese people resolutely oppose.

　　We Chinese people support the active efforts of the Japanese people to defend peace, oppose military bases, oppose nuclear weapons, and demand the return of Okinawa from the United States. We wish the Japanese people new victories in their struggle.

　　U.S. aggressive forces must withdraw from Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait, and the Penghu Islands. The Chinese people must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. We resolutely oppose any conspiracy to create "two Chinas." All conspiracies and actions that attempt to split China and so-called "independize" China's territory of Taiwan will surely be utterly defeated!

　　We Chinese people are friendly to the Japanese people. We are willing to work together with the Japanese people to promote the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan at an early date, to develop economic and cultural cooperation, and to defend peace in Asia and the world!

　　We hope that you friends will bring the friendship and peaceful wishes of the Chinese people to the Japanese people.

    努力实现亚非团结大会宣言和决议
    日本友好访华团和我国出席亚非团结大会代表举行座谈
    并愿共同努力恢复中日邦交和发展两国经济文化合作
    新华社30日讯　出席亚非人民团结大会后访问中国的日本友好访华代表团和中国出席亚非人民团结大会代表团的一部分团员30日在北京举行了座谈会。参加座谈会的，日本方面：日本友好访华代表团团长一之濑隆富，副团长山田长吉、三村贤治，秘书长斋藤耘平，团员牧之内武人、宫川宽雄、米内山义一郎、水泽正、子田忠男、梶谷善久、宫腰喜助、大久保信一、秋山德雄、秀岛乾、浅野辅；中国方面：出席亚非人民团结大会中国代表团副团长包尔汉、楚图南，团员王力、王光英、邓光、达浦生、朱子奇、吴晗、金仲华、唐明照、戚慕光、韩幽桐、杨春松、董昕、赵朴初。
    在座谈会上，双方代表就相互关切的各项问题，在友好的气氛中交换了意见。首先，双方代表一致肯定了1957年12月26日至1958年1月1日在埃及首都开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会的重大成就，并认为这次大会对于加强亚非各国人民的友好团结和促进亚非各国人民拥护民族独立和争取世界持久和平的共同事业作出了历史性的贡献。双方代表一致表示要为争取实现大会的宣言和各项决议而努力。
    日本友好访华代表团团长一之濑隆富先生在座谈会上宣读了日本友好访华代表团的声明：
    亚非人民团结大会闭幕后，参加这次大会的四十五个国家的五百多名代表，都在各自的国家努力向群众传达和平、独立和友好的强烈愿望。
    正当此时，日本代表团中的十五名代表组织了友好代表团应苏联和中国的亚洲团结委员会、和平委员会的邀请，获得访问两国、促进和平与友好的机会，实感荣幸。
    日本友好访华代表团到达中国以来，参观了各方面的设施并同中国各界人士进行了亲切的交谈。访华代表团的团员中，虽然有的人曾经数次访问过中国，也有的人研究过中国问题，但是对于中国建设发展得这样雄伟确实是出乎意料的，都表示敬佩，并对于中国方面的充满热情的款待，深为感激。同时想到日本过去和目前的情况，不胜惭愧。
    由于日本军阀和财阀的错误政策，日本给中国带来了笔墨难以形容的惨祸，至今丝毫未予补偿。但是中国人民对日本人民仍给予无限的谅解和伸出友谊之手，这使我们深为感动。
    日本友好访华代表团感到在开罗召开的亚非人民团结大会的重要性的同时，特别感到日本同六亿五千万人民所拥护的唯一的中国——中华人民共和国之间的正常邦交的恢复，不仅是亚洲而且是全世界和平不可缺少的条件。有鉴于此，日本友好访华代表团愿为实现以下各项目标而奋斗：
    一、努力实现亚非人民团结大会宣言和各项决议；
    二、为日中邦交的恢复和经济文化交流而努力；
    三、支持首脑会议，并促其早日实现；
    四、要求立即全面禁止试验和使用核武器；
    五、为巩固世界和平而奋斗。
  在一之濑隆富先生宣读了声明后，中国出席亚非人民团结大会的代表团副团长包尔汉作了发言：
    今天我们能够在北京再次和出席亚非人民团结大会后来我国访问的十五位日本朋友们见面和交换意见，感到非常高兴。我谨代表出席大会的中国代表团热烈欢迎各位朋友。
    我们欢迎一之濑隆富先生刚刚所宣读的声明。
    中国人民完全支持开罗大会所通过的宣言和各项决议，并愿意为实现大会的宣言和决议，为贯彻大会所明确肯定的万隆会议十项原则、和平共处五项原则和反对帝国主义、殖民主义、艾森豪威尔主义，反对巴格达条约、东南亚条约，反对种族歧视，为了争取与保卫亚非各国人民的独立、幸福和世界持久和平，中国人民愿同日本人民和亚非各国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民团结一致克服一切困难和阻碍，不懈地努力，使我们的为独立和平和友好团结的共同事业取得更大的胜利。
    中国人民一贯主张立即禁止试验、使用核武器和普遍裁减军备。我们完全支持苏联最近提出的关于禁止试验核武器、实现裁军的合理主张和召开大国首脑会议的建议。但是，目前美国战争势力正加紧推行备战政策和侵犯他国的独立、主权，在世界各地扩建原子、导弹基地的侵略行为，危害世界和平和安全，这是我们中国人民坚决反对的。
    我们中国人民支持日本人民保卫和平、反对军事基地、反对核武器，要求从美国手中收回冲绳岛的积极努力。我们祝日本人民的斗争取得新的胜利。
    美国侵略势力必须撤出台湾、台湾海峡和澎湖列岛。中国人民一定要解放自己神圣的领土台湾。解放台湾是中国的内政问题，决不容许外国的干涉。我们坚决反对任何制造“两个中国”的阴谋。一切企图分裂中国、使中国领土台湾所谓“独立化”的阴谋和行为，都一定会遭到彻底失败的！
    我们中国人民对日本人民是友好的。我们愿意和日本人民为促进中日人民的友谊，为早日恢复中日两国邦交的正常关系，为发展经济和文化合作和保卫亚洲及世界和平而共同努力！
    我们希望各位朋友们把中国人民的友好与和平的愿望带给日本人民。
