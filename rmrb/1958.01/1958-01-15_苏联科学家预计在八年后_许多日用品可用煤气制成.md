Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: It is expected that by 1965, almost everything in our rooms can be made from hydrocarbons in oil, coal, and gas. In another ten to fifteen years, we will be able to use ethylene to make woolen fabrics. At that time, air will also be an important raw material, and many daily necessities will be made from "nothing" but gas. This was mentioned by Professor Shuykin, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in an interview with a reporter from the "Soviet Russia" newspaper.

Professor Shuykin said that in the future, in the kitchen, we will use methane to cook. One cubic meter of methane will be enough to cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and to boil water for washing dishes. Hydrocarbon gas can be used to make soft leather, and these artificial leathers can be made into exquisite handbags, gorgeous suitcases, and beautiful leather shoes.

Recently, the "Institute of Organoelement Compounds," led by Academician Nesmeyanov, used ethylene and carbon tetrachloride to make a peculiar fiber. This fiber is very strong; a thickness of one millimeter can bear the weight of a person. Clothes woven from it are durable, warm, and several times cheaper than woolen fabrics.

Professor Shuykin pointed out that in the future, gas will be a substitute for steel, glass, wood, cotton, and fur. For example, gas can be used to make furniture, decorations, and toys that look like iron, ivory, wood, and platinum. It can also be used to make alcohol and synthetic rubber. Even publishing a newspaper will be inseparable from gas. Printing ink will be made from soot, and lead type will be replaced by plastic molds. This new type of mold is lightweight, durable, and harmless to health, and will surely be welcomed by workers.

    苏联科学家预计在八年后
    许多日用品可用煤气制成
    新华社莫斯科14日电　预计到1965年，我们房间中一切东西差不多都可用石油、煤和煤气中的碳氢化合物来制成。再过十年到十五年，我们就可用成油气（乙烯）来制造毛织物了。那时，空气也将是一种重要原料，许多日用品将由“一无所有”的气体制成。这是苏联科学院通讯院士舒伊金教授在同“苏维埃俄罗斯报”记者谈话中所提到的。
    舒伊金教授说，将来，在厨房里，我们将用沼气（甲烷）来烧饭。只要有一立方公尺的沼气便可做好早饭、午饭和晚饭，并且烧水洗濯器皿。用烃气将可制成柔软的皮革，这些人造皮革可以制成精致的皮包、华丽的皮箱和漂亮的皮鞋。
    最近，由?斯米扬诺夫院士领导的“元素有机化合物研究所”用成油气（乙烯）和四氯化碳制成了一种奇异的纤维。这种纤维很坚韧，只要有一毫米的厚度便可载负一个人的重量。用它织成的衣服很耐用，温暖，价格比羊毛织品要便宜几倍。
    舒伊金教授指出，将来，煤气将是钢铁、玻璃、木材、棉花和毛皮的代用物。例如，用煤气可以制造外形像铁、象牙、木料和白金的家具、装饰品和玩具，还可以制成酒精和人造橡胶。就说出版一张报纸吧，也将离不开煤气。印刷颜料将由煤烟制成，铅字将被塑料字模所代替。这种新式字模，既轻便耐用，又对健康无害，必将很受工人的欢迎。
