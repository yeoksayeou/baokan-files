Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 16th: A press communique issued here tonight regarding the talks between Indonesian President Sukarno and Egyptian President Nasser stated: "President Nasser reaffirmed the Egyptian government and people's complete support for the Indonesian government and people's struggle to liberate West Irian."

    This communique, released by Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio at a press conference, said that President Nasser has accepted an invitation to visit Indonesia "once circumstances permit."

    The communique said: During Sukarno's visit, the two presidents held several talks. They explored political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries and agreed that there are broad prospects for development in these areas. They expressed their determination to further strengthen relations between the two countries. They also discussed the general international situation.

    The two presidents reaffirmed their loyalty to the principles of the Bandung Conference and the principles of the United Nations Charter.

    The communique stated that the two presidents "fully agreed that a policy of non-alignment is the best way to safeguard the national interests of Egypt and Indonesia, thereby completing their respective contributions to world peace, prosperity, and stability."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 16th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated at a press conference here tonight that Indonesia does not oppose purchasing Soviet arms.

    Subandrio said that Indonesia is interested in understanding the benefits of Egypt's arms deals with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, as well as the prices and quality of these arms. The recent visit of an Indonesian military delegation to Egypt was for this purpose.

    He continued, if new sources of arms and industrial equipment were opened to Indonesia, then, in principle, it would not object to purchasing from these sources on a commercial basis and without political or military conditions. He said, therefore, "I can say that we are not opposed in principle to purchasing Russian arms."

    He also said that he had materials showing that Soviet weapons were "excellent" and "cheaper" than similar weapons from other countries.

    Subandrio confirmed earlier rumors that Indonesia was exploring the possibility of purchasing light weapons from Egypt.

    In answering questions, Subandrio also said that West Germany had not offered to mediate between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Indonesia does not intend to bring the issue to the United Nations, at least not in the old form of demanding negotiations with the Netherlands.

    Subandrio said that the current political trends in the Netherlands do not guarantee swift negotiations. On the other hand, Indonesia is not in a hurry to conduct such negotiations. He said that as far as Indonesia is concerned, there will be no armed conflict over the West Irian issue.

    When asked for his opinion on the proposal by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin to hold a summit meeting, Subandrio said, "We support any efforts that may lead to the easing of international tensions, although we cannot play a major role in this regard. It is up to the major powers to seek common ground."

    Regarding relations between Indonesia and Japan, Subandrio said that negotiations between the two countries have reached a certain stage. The Japanese Foreign Minister is expected to arrive in Jakarta on January 19, and he himself will fly back from Belgrade to sign a reparations agreement with the Japanese side. He also said that the prospects for economic cooperation between the two countries are "quite good."

    苏加诺和纳赛尔举行多次会谈
    埃及重申支持解放西伊里安斗争
    印度尼西亚外长表示不反对购买苏联军火
    据新华社开罗16日电　今晚在这里发表的关于印度尼西亚总统苏加诺和埃及总统纳赛尔会谈的新闻公报说：“纳赛尔总统重申埃及政府和人民完全支持印度尼西亚政府和人民解放西伊里安的斗争。”
    这项公报由印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在记者招待会上公布，它说，纳赛尔总统已经接受邀请，在“一旦情况许可时访问印度尼西亚”。
    公报说：在苏加诺访问期间，两位总统举行了几次会谈。他们探讨了两国间的政治、经济和文化合作，并且同意在这些方面有广大的发展前途。他们表示了进一步加强两国间关系的决心。他们也讨论了一般国际局势。
    两位总统重申忠于万隆会议的原则和联合国宪章的原则。
    公报说，两位总统“完全一致地认为，不参加集团的政策是维护埃及和印度尼西亚的民族利益，从而完成它们两国各自对世界和平、繁荣和稳定的贡献的最好办法。”
    据新华社开罗16日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今晚在这里举行的记者招待会上说，印度尼西亚不反对购买苏联军火。
    苏班德里约说，印度尼西亚对于了解埃及同苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的军火交易的好处，以及这些军火的价格和质量方面都感到兴趣。印度尼西亚军事代表团最近访问埃及就是为了这个目的。
    他接着说，如果对印度尼西亚开放了提供军火和工业设备的新的来源的话，那么，它原则上是不反对在商业基础上和不附有政治或军事条件的情况下，向这些来源去购买的。他说，因此，“我可以说，我们原则上是不反对购买俄国军火的。”
    他还说，他有材料表明，苏联的武器是“精良的”，而且比别的国家同类的武器“要便宜些”。
    苏班德里约证实了前些时传闻的关于印度尼西亚正在试探从埃及购买轻武器的可能性的消息。
    苏班德里约在答复问题时还说，西德并没有提出它要在印度尼西亚和荷兰之间进行调停。印度尼西亚不打算把这个问题提到联合国，至少不会以要求荷兰谈判的这种旧的形式提出。
    苏班德里约说，目前荷兰的政治趋势并不能保证会迅速进行谈判。而另一方面，印度尼西亚也并不急于进行这样的谈判。他说，就印度尼西亚方面来说，在西伊里安问题上不会有武装冲突。
    有人要求苏班德里约对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁提出的关于举行最高级会议的建议发表意见，他说，“我们支持可能导致缓和国际紧张局势的任何努力，虽然我们在这方面起不了多大作用。这要由大国来寻求共同的基础。”
    苏班德里约在谈到印度尼西亚和日本的关系时说，两国之间的谈判已经达到了一定的阶段。日本外务相预期在1月19日到达雅加达，而他自己将由贝尔格莱德乘飞机回国，和日本方面签订一项赔偿协定。他还说，两国间进行经济合作的前景是“相当好的”。
