    People Eliminate the Four Pests, Invite the Star of Longevity: Yangxiao Village is Fresh, Clean and Tidy, Every Family is Happy and Healthy
    Yangxiao Village in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, is a village that has basically eliminated the four pests.
    Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign in 1952, the masses of Yangxiao Village have persisted in this movement for five years, developing a habit of loving cleanliness and hygiene. They have achieved no cobwebs on the ceiling, no messy clothing, no accumulated dust on the ground, and neat and orderly furniture. The village roads are flat and clean, the ditches are unobstructed, with no stagnant water, and few weeds. The well platforms of public drinking wells are all above the ground, and the wellheads are covered. The small manure ponds in each household courtyard are all leveled, and the village has built two public fertilizer accumulation sites and two public toilets, which are regularly kept clean and free of flies and maggots. They have also achieved separation of humans and livestock, with livestock pens that are swept daily and kept dry and clean.
    Because Yangxiao Village has paid attention to eliminating the four pests and maintaining cleanliness and hygiene, the incidence of diseases has been greatly reduced over the years. Taking malaria and dysentery, which are mainly transmitted by flies and mosquitoes, as an example, in 1951, 39 people in the village suffered from malaria and 22 from dysentery. The numbers decreased year by year. In 1957, the number of malaria cases had been reduced to seven, and no dysentery cases have been found in the past two years. Due to the good cleanliness and hygiene in the village, the amount of accumulated fertilizer in 1957 doubled compared with 1951. Therefore, grain production has greatly increased. Elderly farmer Yu Shaozhi said, "In the past, a wheat harvest of four dou per mu was considered a top harvest, but in 1957, wheat yielded more than five dou, and sweet potatoes used to be only about a thousand jin, but in 1957 it reached more than two thousand jin. This is all because we have accumulated more manure by cleaning up." Zhu Wenzhong said, "People eliminate the four pests, invite the star of longevity. I am seventy-three years old, and I have not been sick in recent years."
    Yangxiao Village is surrounded by embankments, with a clean main road running through the village. Clusters of white-walled thatched houses are scattered among the green trees, everywhere is fresh and tidy, and everyone is healthy and happy. People who come to this village from other places feel particularly refreshed, and some praise, "This village looks good no matter how you look at it."

    人民除四害  请来长寿星  杨小寨清新整洁  一家家快乐健康
    安徽省界首县杨小寨村是一个基本消灭了四害的村庄。
    从1952年开展爱国卫生运动以来，杨小寨的群众五年如一日地坚持了这一运动，养成了喜爱清洁卫生的习惯。他们已做到房内顶无蛛丝、屋衣，地无堆积尘土，家具物件整洁有序。村内道路平坦清洁，水沟畅通，无积水坑，杂草也很少。公共饮水井的井台都高出地面，井口上加盖。每户院内小粪池全部垫平，全村建有两个公共积肥所和二个公共厕所，厕所内经常保持清洁无蝇蛆。他们并做到了人畜隔离，牲畜有圈，畜栏每天打扫，保持干燥清洁。
    杨小寨村由于注意了除四害，保持了清洁卫生，历年来的发病率大大减少。以苍蝇蚊子传染为主的疟疾、痢疾来看，1951年全村患疟疾三十九人，痢疾二十二人，以后逐年减少，1957年患疟疾已减为七人，两年来未发现痢疾。该村由于清洁卫生搞得好，1957年的积肥数量比1951年增加了一倍，因此，粮食产量大大增加。老年农民于绍治说，“过去每亩麦收四斗就是上等的收成，1957年麦子合五斗多，红芋过去只千把斤，1957年达到了二千多斤，这都是因为打扫卫生多攒了粪土的缘故。”朱文仲说，“人民除四害，请来长寿星。我这七十三岁的人，这几年也没有害过病。”
    杨小寨村四周圩堤环绕，一条整洁的大路贯通村内，一簇簇的粉墙草屋分散在绿树中，处处清新整洁，人人健康快乐。从外地走到这个村里的人，都感到心情特别舒畅，有的赞扬说：“这个村庄怎么看怎么好”。
