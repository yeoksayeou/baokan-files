Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - The news published recently in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" about Soviet scientist Pronin observing the "Snowman" twice last year has aroused great interest in the Soviet Union. (Note: Pronin, the head of the hydrology team of the joint expedition of Leningrad University and the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Republic, discovered a human-like animal standing on a cliff in the uninhabited area along the Balyandkik River Valley on August 10, 1957. It was a bit hunchbacked, not tall, walked on two feet, covered in reddish-brown fur, and had long forelimbs. He saw it for five to eight minutes. Three days later, on August 13, Pronin saw the "Snowman" again in the same place, quickly disappearing into a cave.) On the 18th, the Soviet "Izvestia" published an interview with the hydrologist by an "Izvestia" correspondent in Leningrad under the title "Is this really a Snowman?"

Pronin told the "Izvestia" reporter that when his hydrology team left the Pamirs, they lost a rubber boat on the river bank near their survey site and couldn't find it anywhere. A month later, the boat was suddenly found intact five kilometers upstream from where it was lost. Pronin asked nearby residents if they had seen any strange animals similar to humans. Some people answered affirmatively. They also said that this mysterious animal likes to play pranks. For example, some residents often lose furniture and sundries, such as washbasins, face basins, and even clothes, but afterwards, these items are often found in the mountains. Pronin said that these facts may be related to the mysterious movement of the rubber boat.

Pronin also said that the place where these things happened is a valley called Balyandkik. The name means "one million goats." Various delicious wild fruits grow in this area.

Pronin continued, "Some people blame me for not going to the rock wall where this animal appeared and not investigating the cave where it was hiding. However, only those who do not understand the Pamirs would say such things. The animal I saw was on a very high and steep rock wall. Even experienced mountaineers would find it difficult to reach there."

    苏联科学家普罗宁谈他亲眼所见
    帕米尔有“雪人”出没
    这种混身兽毛的类人动物喜欢恶作剧
    据新华社莫斯科20日电　不久前苏联“共青团真理报”上发表的关于苏联科学家普罗宁去年曾经两次观察到“雪人”的消息，已经在苏联引起了很大的兴趣。（按：苏联列宁格勒大学和乌兹别克共和国科学院联合考察队的水文队队长普罗宁于1957年8月10日，在沿着巴梁德基克河谷没有人烟的地区进行考察时，发现在悬崖高处站着一个类人动物，他有点驼背，身材不高，用两脚走路，身上长着暗红色的兽毛，前肢很长。这一次他看到了有五到八分钟。过了三天，8月13日，普罗宁又在原地看到“雪人”，很快隐没在山洞中。）18日，苏联“消息报”又以“这真正是雪人吗？”为题发表了这位水文学家对“消息报”驻列宁格勒记者的谈话。
    普罗宁向“消息报”的记者说，当他所率领的水文队离开帕米尔以前，在他们考察地点附近的河岸上遗失了一只橡皮船，到处找不到。一个月后，忽然在离遗失地点五公里的上游地带发现这只船完整无损地放在那儿。普罗宁曾问过附近居民，他们是否看见过类似人的奇异的动物。有些人肯定地回答了这个问题。他们还说，这种神秘的动物喜欢恶作剧。例如有些居民时常丢失家具杂物，如洗衣盆、脸盆、甚至衣服等，但过后，这些物件常常在山上找到。普罗宁说，可能，这些事实和橡皮船的神秘移动有着联系。
    普罗宁还说，发生这些事情的地方，是一个名叫巴梁德基克的河谷。这个地名的意思是“一百万只山羊”。在这个地区生长着各种美味的野果。
    普罗宁继续说，有人责怪我，为什么我没有到这个动物出现的岩壁上去，并且没有侦查出它所隐藏的洞穴。但是，只有那些不了解帕米尔的人才会这样来议论。我所看见的动物是在极高的陡峭的岩壁上。那里甚至是有经验的爬山运动员也不容易到达的。
