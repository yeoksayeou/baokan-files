    France Kills Algerian Patriotic Young Woman
    Last April, the French colonial authorities, under the pretext of a bomb explosion in a cafe in Algiers, carried out massive searches and arrests, and illegally sentenced four Algerian patriotic young women to death. Among them, Raymond Beschad died under torture, and Jamila Bouassa was driven insane in the court of the French colonial authorities. A young woman named Jamila Bouhide was hanged.
    Jamila Bouhide, only twenty-two years old, was a nurse in the Algerian National Liberation Army. She was shot in the arm when she was arrested, and documents of the Algerian National Liberation Front were seized from her. The French colonialists tortured her for three months, falsely accusing her of being the "culprit" of the bomb explosion. This young woman and her lawyer refuted the French colonial authorities' shameful slander, and showed heroic spirit of defiance in the face of death after being sentenced to hang. She spoke with fervor in the enemy's court: "I know you will sentence me to death, ... but I am innocent. ... The fact is that I love my country, and I want it to be free, therefore, I support the National Liberation Front. ... You cannot stop Algeria from moving towards independence."
    This atrocity of the French colonial authorities has aroused anger and protests from the people of France, Asia, and Africa. The French Women's Union and the French Young Women's Union called on French women to unite and fight to save Jamila Bouhide. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at the open meeting of the 63rd National Congress of the Indian National Congress: "It is clear that the execution of these young women will not intimidate the Algerian nation, but only arouse their more intense anger."
    The Indonesian Women's Congress issued a statement on the 20th of this month, protesting against the French government's death sentence to four Algerian girls who fought for national independence, and demanding that the French government revoke this verdict that violates humanitarian principles. Indonesian youth organizations, including the Indonesian Youth Front, which represents two million youths of various tendencies, the Indonesian National Student Union, and the Indonesian Islamic Women's Association, have also protested against the barbaric actions of the French government.

    法国杀害阿尔及利亚爱国女青年
    去年4月，法国殖民当局借口阿尔及尔市一家咖啡馆发生炸弹爆炸事件，大肆进行搜捕，并对四位阿尔及利亚爱国女青年非法判处死刑。其中雷蒙德·贝斯夏德在严刑拷打中被折磨而死，加米拉·布阿萨在法殖民当局的法庭上被逼疯了。有一个名叫加米拉·布伊海德的女青年则被处绞刑。
    加米拉·布伊海德，还只有二十二岁，她是阿尔及利亚民族解放军的女护士。她在被捕时臂上中了一枪，身上携带的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线文件被搜去了。法国殖民者对她进行了三个月的酷刑拷打，硬诬指她是炸弹爆炸事件的“凶手”。这位女青年和她的辩护律师驳斥了法国殖民当局可耻的诬陷，并在被宣判绞刑后表现了临难不屈的英雄气概。她在敌人的法庭上慷慨陈词：“我知道你们要判我死刑，……不过我是无罪的。……事实就是我爱我的国家，我希望它得到自由，因此，我拥护民族解放阵线。……你们阻止不了阿尔及利亚走向独立。”
    法国殖民当局的这一暴行，激起了法国和亚非各国人民的愤怒和抗议。法兰西妇女联盟和法国女青年联盟号召法国妇女团结一致，为拯救加米拉·布伊海德而斗争。印度总理尼赫鲁在印度国大党第六十三届年会的公开会议上说：“很显然，处决这些女青年是吓不倒阿尔及利亚民族的，而只是激起他们更激烈的愤怒”。
    印度尼西亚妇女大会在本月20日发表了一项声明，抗议法国政府判处四位为争取民族独立的阿尔及利亚姑娘以死刑，并要求法国政府取消这一违反人道原则的判决。代表二百万各种不同倾向的青年组成的印度尼西亚青年阵线、印度尼西亚全国大学生联合会、印度尼西亚伊斯兰妇女协会等团体也对法国政府这种野蛮行动提出抗议。上面就是加米拉·布伊海德的照片。（士义）
