Reported by our newspaper: A nationwide mass movement for farmland irrigation and water conservancy construction is continuing to surge forward. From October of last year to early January of this year, in just one hundred days, nearly four-fifths of the 1958 annual farmland irrigation and water conservancy plan has been achieved (note: the annual farmland irrigation and water conservancy period runs from October of the previous year to September of the following year). The various projects that have been completed can expand the irrigated area by a total of 73,589,000 mu; at the same time, the irrigation area has been improved by 25,228,000 mu, 33,948,000 mu of low-lying land has been controlled, and 22,343 square kilometers of soil erosion area has been controlled. From a global perspective, the speed of progress and the scale of the movement are both unprecedented. Looking at individual regions, the suburbs of Tianjin have completed nearly three times their original annual plan, Anhui Province, Guangxi Province, and Shaanxi Province have completed more than one and a half times their original annual plan, and Hubei Province, Hebei Province, and Gansu Province have also exceeded their original annual plan. In addition, with soil and water conservation projects, the achievements of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are even greater. The absolute numbers of the completed projects expanding the irrigated area are the largest in Hebei and Henan provinces. Hebei Province has increased the irrigated area by more than 17 million mu, and Henan Province has increased the irrigated area by more than 15 million mu. The two provinces combined account for more than 44% of the total increase in irrigated area nationwide. Compared with regions where the movement has progressed rapidly, some regions appear to lack enthusiasm and have made slow progress. For example, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Fujian, Guizhou, and other provinces and regions had not achieved one-fifth of the planned area for expanding irrigation for the entire year by early January. In order to exchange information on the progress of farmland irrigation and water conservancy work in various regions in a timely manner and promote the further development of the farmland irrigation and water conservancy construction movement, this newspaper is today publishing a table of the 1958 annual farmland irrigation and water conservancy and soil and water conservation plans of various provinces, regions, and cities, showing the progress made up to early January (see page 2). In the future, we plan to publish it once every ten days, scheduled for the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month.

    先进的再前进　迟缓的赶上去
    请看一看各地农田水利建设运动进展的情况
    本报讯　全国规模的群众性的农田水利建设运动正在继续高涨。从去年10月到今年1月上旬，一百天的光景，已经实现了1958年度农田水利计划数的将近五分之四（按：农田水利年度是从头一年10月到第二年9月）。已经完成的各项工程，总共可以扩大灌溉面积七千三百五十八万九千亩；同时，又改善灌溉面积二千五百二十二万八千亩，治理洼地三千三百九十四万八千亩，控制水土流失面积二万二千三百四十三平方公里。从全局来看，进度的迅速和规模的巨大都是史无前例的。就各个地区来看，天津郊区已经完成了原定全年计划的将近三倍，安徽省、广西省、陕西省已经完成了原定全年计划的一倍半以上，湖北省、河北省、甘肃省也都超过了原定的全年计划。再加上水土保持工程，陕西、甘肃两省的成绩就更大了。已经完成的工程扩大灌溉面积的绝对数字最大的是河北、河南两省，河北省已经增加灌溉面积一千七百多万亩，河南省已经增加灌溉面积一千五百多万亩，两省合计占全国增加灌溉面积总数的44％强。同运动进展迅速的地区比较起来，相形之下，有些地区就显得劲头不足、进展迟缓。如新疆、云南、福建、贵州等省区，到1月上旬为止都还没有实现全年扩大的灌溉面积计划数的五分之一。为了及时交流各地农田水利工作进展情况，促进农田水利建设运动进一步开展，本报今天把各省、区、市1958年度农田水利及水土保持计划到1月上旬为止实现的情况列表公布（见第二版）。今后打算每旬公布一次，时间定为每月1日、11日、21日。
