Giving Full Play to the Promoting Role of Youth in the Revolution

The recent enlarged Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League fully reflected the vigorous revolutionary spirit of our country's youth. This is a promoting meeting for the cause of educating the younger generation in our country with the spirit of communism, and for the current high tide of industrial and agricultural production in our country. We believe that under the promotion of this meeting, the communist youth movement in our country will surely achieve a new leap forward.

Our youth have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They closely followed the Chinese Communist Party, bravely standing at the forefront of the revolutionary ranks in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, demonstrating that they are a powerful shock force in the revolutionary struggle. The great contributions made by our youth in the struggle to successfully realize the First Five-Year Plan further demonstrated that "they are the vanguards of our country's socialist construction cause" (Deng Xiaoping: Speech at the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League). Especially after this nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, that is, the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts, the fighting spirit of the vast number of young people has become even more vigorous. In the new socialist production upsurge, the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of young workers and peasants has soared unprecedentedly. The vast number of educated youth enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, bravely going to the mountains and the countryside to participate in physical labor, and students in schools are implementing work-study programs, striving to train and transform themselves. The political and ideological outlook of our country's youth is rapidly changing. Diligence and thrift, and vitality have become the prominent characteristics of the youth movement during this period. And the vigorous youth movement has further promoted the development of our country's socialist construction cause. All these facts vividly show that under the education of the Chinese Communist Party, the vast number of young people in our country can not only play a revolutionary promoting role in the revolutionary struggle, but also play a revolutionary promoting role in the construction struggle. Now, the Party has called for catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of steel and important industrial products in fifteen years or more, and at the same time, making our country a country with high yields per unit area in the world in agriculture. The next fifteen years will be decisive fifteen years for both the world and our country. And these fifteen years are precisely the period when our generation of young people grow up and contribute to socialism. Therefore, giving full play to the revolutionary promoting role of youth under the leadership of the Party has extremely great and far-reaching significance.

To give full play to the promoting role of youth in the revolution, we must tirelessly strengthen the political and ideological education of youth. The facts of the past one or two years vividly illustrate that when we strengthened ideological work, the socialist consciousness of youth rapidly improved, their fighting spirit was high, and they were full of energy. Conversely, when we relaxed ideological work, bourgeois ideology would take the opportunity to enter and corrode youth. Because, in the transition period, the main contradiction in our society is still the contradiction between the socialist and capitalist roads. The struggle between the working-class ideology and the bourgeois ideology is still a long-term struggle. Our country's socialist system provides very favorable conditions for the healthy growth of youth. But we cannot therefore think that bourgeois ideology will automatically disappear without struggle, and that youth will spontaneously become socialist fighters without education and training. How can we make our country's youth grow into true communists? The most important thing here is to attract youth to participate in the actual struggle of socialism, and to educate youth through struggle. A person must go into the water first to learn to swim. Only by participating in actual struggles with workers and peasants, and in the big melting pot of the collective, can youth get rid of the influence of capitalist ideology, especially individualism. Lenin said: "Only by working and integrating with workers and peasants can one become a true communist." Therefore, we cannot separate the ideological and political education work of the Communist Youth League from organizing youth to participate in political struggle and production struggle, but should combine ideological and political education with actual struggle. Guiding youth to actively participate in the labor of building socialism, and making youth receive communist education from it, these two are consistent. This is the principle of combining theory and practice that our Party has always advocated, and the viewpoint of unifying the transformation of the objective world and the transformation of the subjective world.

To give play to the promoting role of youth in socialist construction, we must combine heroic labor with mastering technology. Courageous drive is needed for both revolution and construction. Without this drive, the revolution cannot succeed; without this drive, construction will not succeed. But in order to build our country into a strong country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we must not only have courageous drive but also strive to master various advanced technologies. To build, we must march toward nature and conquer nature. Just as we must learn to master the laws of class struggle in the revolutionary struggle, we must learn to master the laws of conquering nature in the construction struggle, and this is to learn science and technology. To quickly change the backward face of our motherland, we must use the most advanced science and technology to equip our country's industry and agriculture, and carry out the technical transformation of our country's industry and agriculture as soon as possible. Our country's youth not only have the responsibility to learn and inherit the excellent production technology of the older generation, but also have the responsibility to accept the latest science and technology as soon as possible. Politics plus technology, drive plus diligence, should be our battle cry to encourage youth. Whether among young workers, young peasants, or educated youth, we must greatly promote the atmosphere of diligence and thrift in study and hard work, quickly master and promote the advanced experience created in various places, and implement the method of learning while doing, doing while learning, and closely combining learning with practical operation. For young students, we should advocate work-study programs and half-work half-study, which not only embodies the spirit of diligence and thrift in seeking knowledge, but also makes the process of seeking knowledge a process of combining mental labor and physical labor. For young workers and peasants, we should not only make them proficient in the skills of their positions, but also organize them to take refresher courses in their spare time to improve their cultural and scientific knowledge level.

In short, the task of our Party and the Communist Youth League is to train the younger generation into a new type of worker with communist consciousness and a certain level of cultural and technical skills, that is, to make our country's youth both politically firm and have a clear stand, and have labor skills and professional abilities. Among these two, politics is the commander and the soul, and technology is the weapon and the tool. Both red and expert, both political and technical, this is the direction of efforts for our generation of young people.

Our Party has always attached importance to the active force of youth. Young people are brave and active, accept new things quickly, and have a strong spirit of enterprise and shock, which is a valuable feature and a powerful factor in promoting the revolutionary cause. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "Youth is the most active and vigorous force in the entire social force. They are the most willing to learn, and have the least conservative thinking, especially in the socialist era. It is hoped that Party organizations in various places, in coordination with the Communist Youth League organizations, will pay attention to studying how to especially give play to the strength of young people, and not treat them generally, obliterating their characteristics." At the same time, young people also have unavoidable weaknesses, that is, their foundation is shallow, their experience is insufficient, and they are also easily invaded by non-proletarian consciousness. This requires the older generation to care about their education, and also requires young people to humbly learn from their elders. In the past few years, Party and League organizations in various places have accumulated many good experiences and created many lively working methods and organizational forms in educating and organizing young people to actively participate in the country's economic and cultural construction. Methods and forms such as youth shock teams and shock activities of various natures, youth production teams and groups, mountain basic construction teams, youth planting groups, youth experimental fields, youth technology learning groups, and youth activist conferences have been significantly effective in giving play to the labor enthusiasm of youth, cultivating youth with a socialist labor attitude, organizing them to learn technology and promote advanced experience, and creating excellent production achievements. Experience has proved that as long as under the leadership of the Party organization and with the support of adults and old people, unfolding various activities suitable for the characteristics of young people will not only not affect but also promote the completion of the central task; it will not only not affect but also consolidate the production order; it will not only not distract but also enrich the mass movement.

The Communist Youth League is the core that leads the vast number of young people, and is the strongest link between the Party and educating young people. Party committees at all levels should further strengthen the leadership of the League, regularly check and discuss the work of the League, point out the direction of work, assign work tasks, and guide the League committees at all levels to actively and proactively carry out work in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, especially to help the League cadres improve their thinking and work style, learn the working methods of the mass line, guide them to go deep into the grassroots, boost revolutionary drive, and develop our country's youth movement more vigorously.

### 充分发挥青年在革命中的促进作用

    充分发挥青年在革命中的促进作用
    最近召开的中国共产主义青年团扩大的三届二中全会，充分地反映了我国青年朝气蓬勃的革命干劲。这对于用共产主义精神来教育我国青年一代的事业，对于当前正在发展的我国工农业生产的高潮，都是一次促进的会议。我们相信，在这次会议的推动之下，我国共产主义的青年运动，必将得到新的跃进。
    我国青年有着光荣的革命传统。他们紧紧地跟着中国共产党，在民主革命和社会主义革命当中，英勇地站在革命队伍的前头，表明了自己是革命斗争中一支有力的突击部队。我国青年在胜利实现第一个五年计划斗争中所作出的巨大贡献，又进一步表明“他们是我国社会主义建设事业的急先锋”（邓小平：在共青团第三次代表大会上的祝词）。特别是经过这次全民整风和反右派斗争，也就是思想战线和政治战线上的社会主义革命，广大青年的斗志更为昂扬。在新的社会主义生产高潮里面，广大工农青年的劳动积极性空前高涨。广大知识青年热烈响应党的号召，奋勇地上山下乡，参加体力劳动，在校学生实行勤工俭学，努力锻炼和改造。我国青年的政治思想面貌正在迅速地发生变化。勤劳节俭，生气勃勃，已成为这个时期中青年运动显明的特征。而蓬勃的青年运动又进一步促进了我国社会主义建设事业的发展。这一切事实生动地表明了，在中国共产党的教育下，我国广大青年不但在革命斗争中能够发挥革命的促进作用，在建设斗争中也同样地可以发挥革命的促进作用。现在，党已经号召：在十五年或者更多的时间内，要在钢铁和重要工业产品的产量方面赶上并且超过英国，同时，在农业上也要相应地使我国成为世界上单位面积高产量的国家。今后的十五年，不论对世界或是我国，都是有着决定意义的十五年。而这十五年中，又正是我国这一代青年成长和为社会主义作出贡献的时期。因此，充分地发挥青年在党领导下的革命的促进作用，有着极为巨大和深远的意义。
    要充分发挥青年在革命中的促进作用，就要不倦地加强对青年的政治思想教育。这一、二年来的事实生动地说明，当我们加强了思想工作的时候，青年的社会主义觉悟就迅速提高，斗志昂扬，浑身是劲。相反的，当我们放松了思想工作的时候，资产阶级思想就会乘机而入，腐蚀青年。因为，在过渡时期中，我国社会的主要矛盾还是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争，还是一个长期的斗争。我国的社会主义制度，为青年的健全成长提供了十分有利的条件。但是不能因此认为资产阶级思想会不经斗争就自动消除，青年会不经教育和锻炼就自发地成为社会主义的战士。怎样使我国青年成长为一个真正的共产主义者呢？在这里最重要的是必须吸引青年去参加社会主义的实际斗争，并且通过斗争去教育青年。一个人要学会游泳，就必须先下水。青年只有在和工农群众一起参加实际斗争中，在集体的大熔炉里，才能摆脱资本主义思想特别是个人主义思想的影响。列宁说：“只有在劳动中和工人、农民打成一片，才能成为真正的共产主义者。”因此，不能把共青团的思想政治教育工作和组织青年参加政治斗争、生产斗争割裂开来，而应当很好地把思想政治教育和实际斗争结合起来。引导青年积极参加建设社会主义的劳动，并且使青年从中受到共产主义教育，这两者是一致的。这是我们党一贯主张的理论和实践相结合的原则，改造客观世界和改造主观世界相统一的观点。
    要发挥青年对社会主义建设的促进作用，必须把英勇劳动和掌握技术结合起来。勇敢的干劲，这对革命和建设都是需要的。没有这种干劲，革命不能成功；没有这种干劲，建设也不会成功。但是为了把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强国，我们不只要有勇敢的干劲而且要努力掌握各种先进技术。要建设，就要向自然进军，征服自然。正像我们在革命斗争中要学会掌握阶级斗争的规律一样，我们在建设斗争中要学会掌握征服自然的规律，这就是要学习科学和技术。我们要迅速地改变我们祖国的落后面貌，我们必须运用最先进的科学技术来装备我国的工业和农业，尽快地对我国工农业实行技术改造。我国青年不仅有学习和继承老一辈的优良的生产技术的责任，而且有尽先接受最新式的科学技术的责任。政治加技术，干劲加钻劲，应当是我们鼓舞青年的战斗口号。无论在青年工人、青年农民和知识青年中，都要大大提倡勤工俭学和勤学苦练的风气，迅速地掌握和推广各地创造的先进经验，实行边学边做、边做边学、把学习和实际操作紧密结合的办法。对于青年学生应当提倡勤工俭学、半工半读，这不仅体现了勤俭求学的精神，而且使求学的过程成为脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的过程。对于青年工人和农民，不但应当使他们熟练本岗位的技巧，而且还应在业余时间中组织他们进修，提高文化和科学知识水平。
    总之，我们党和共青团的任务，是要把青年的一代培养成为有共产主义觉悟和一定文化技术水平的新型的劳动者，就是要使我国青年既是政治坚定、立场鲜明的人，又是具有劳动技能和业务本领的人。这二者当中，政治是统帅、是灵魂，技术是武器、是工具。又红又专，又有政治又有技术，这是我国这一代青年的努力方向。
    我们党历来就是重视青年这一支积极力量的。青年人勇敢积极，接受新鲜事物快，具有强烈的进取心和突击精神，这是一种可贵的特点，这是促进革命事业的有力因素。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中指出：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。希望各地党组织，协同青年团组织，注意研究如何特别发挥青年人的力量，不要将他们一般看待，抹杀了他们的特点。”同时，青年人也有难于避免的弱点，这就是根底浅，经验不足，也容易受非无产阶级意识的侵袭。这就需要年长的一辈关心对他们的教育，也要求青年虚心地向长者学习。在过去几年中，各地党和团的组织在教育和组织青年积极参加国家经济和文化建设的工作中，已经积累了许多好经验，创造了许多生动活泼的工作方法和组织形式。像各种性质的青年突击队和突击活动，青年生产班、组，山区基本建设队，青年种植小组，青年试验田，青年技术学习小组以及青年积极分子会议等方法和形式，在发挥青年的劳动积极性，培养青年具有社会主义的劳动态度，组织他们学习技术和推广先进经验、创造优异的生产成绩等方面，都是有显著的效果的。经验证明，只要在党组织的领导之下，取得了成年人和老年人的赞助，那么，展开各种适合青年特点的活动，不仅不会影响并且会促进中心任务的完成；不仅不会影响并且会巩固生产秩序；不仅不会分散并且会更加充实群众运动。
    共青团是领导广大青年的核心，是党联系和教育青年最强靱的纽带。各级党委应当进一步加强对团的领导，定期检查和讨论团的工作，指明工作方向，分配工作任务，并且指导各级团委按照党的方针和政策积极主动地开展工作，特别是帮助团干部改进思想和作风，学会群众路线的工作方法，指导他们深入基层，鼓起革命干劲，把我国青年运动更加蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
