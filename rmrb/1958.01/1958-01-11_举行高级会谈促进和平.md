Whether to take action to ease international tensions or merely pay lip service to disarmament is the standard by which to measure whether a country has genuine sincerity for peace. By this standard, people see two distinctly different situations between the Soviet Union and the Western powers headed by the United States.

The Soviet government announced a few days ago a reduction of 300,000 troops, more than 40,000 of whom will be withdrawn from the territory of the German Democratic Republic and demobilized. On January 9, the Soviet government once again made a peace proposal to the governments of the United States, Britain, and more than a dozen other countries, advocating that a top-level meeting be held within two to three months with the participation of countries from both the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as some countries that do not participate in military blocs and pursue peaceful policies, such as India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Austria. The purpose is to reach agreements on some major issues in the international situation that are currently most pressing and fully amenable to resolution, in order to improve the international situation, create an atmosphere conducive to resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation rather than through an arms race and war, and facilitate the finding of avenues for agreement on other major outstanding international issues.

Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France in 1955, the Soviet Union, in the spirit of taking practical actions to ease the situation and promote peace, has unilaterally reduced its armed forces for the third time, bringing the total reduction to over two million. The Soviet Union has also reduced its defense expenditures year by year, decreasing the proportion of military spending in the national budget from 20% in 1955 to 16% in 1957. While taking these practical actions, the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward specific proposals to improve the international situation and stop the arms race. The Soviet Union's persistent efforts demonstrate its sincerity for peace, which cannot be erased by the Western countries with the words "propaganda tricks."

On the same day that the Soviet Union put forward a new proactive proposal following new concrete actions, people saw the latest typical example of Western countries paying lip service to peace. This was President Eisenhower's annual State of the Union Address. In this address, he said: "There is only one way to solve the major problems we face. The world must stop the current dangerous course of building up ever-greater destructive weapons and change direction." If the US President were to act in accordance with his own declaration, the whole world would welcome it. However, after carefully reading the US President's address, it is difficult to believe that this declaration contains any genuine sincerity. Although Eisenhower emphasized that his address this year would focus on the issue of peace, in reality, it mainly advocated strengthening military strength, demanding more military spending, and asking the people to make more sacrifices for this. As for peace, as an American congressman said, the address did not put forward any proactive proposals. The address did not even mention a word about Bulganin's proposal, although this is currently the most widely discussed and most eagerly awaited issue for the United States to take a proactive attitude towards.

Eisenhower's State of the Union Address, if it can be said to represent the US government's desire for peace, is more accurately a demonstration that the US government still adheres to the policies of the Cold War and the arms race. Further increasing the military budget and taking a negative attitude towards high-level talks between East and West have nothing in common with genuine sincerity in seeking to ease international tensions and strengthen peace. Eisenhower's continued dissemination of anti-Soviet slanders does nothing to improve international relations, but only poisons the international atmosphere. The US government's actual actions can only lead people to believe that it has no intention of easing the situation, is unwilling to stop the arms race, and opposes peaceful coexistence.

In the past two years, the heads of Western governments have also pretended to talk about peace, but their actions have been to accelerate the arms race and war preparations. The military spending of the North Atlantic Group has increased by about 5% in the past two years, reaching nearly 60 billion US dollars in 1957. The main contributor to this is the United States, which allocates a large part of its annual budget to armaments and military blocs. At the same time, Western countries have used various methods to prevent disarmament negotiations from making progress. They have also used their majority in the United Nations to present unreasonable conditions from the Western countries in a take-it-or-leave-it manner, actually trying to shut the door on disarmament negotiations. All these activities by Western countries have repeatedly stirred up anti-peace currents, worsening the international situation and running counter to the ardent desire of people all over the world to reduce the burden of armaments and eliminate the threat of war.

However, the situation has not developed in the direction hoped for by the Cold War planners. Their attempt to shut the door on negotiations has proven unpopular.

The emergence of intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites has posed a fundamental question to the world: if the Cold War and the arms race continue, it will lead to a war of unprecedented scale. In this war, no place in the world is safe, and the damage and destruction caused will be enormous. If the Cold War is stopped and the human and material resources currently used for the arms race are used to promote social progress and improve people's lives, then the scientific progress shown by artificial satellites will open up a brilliant prospect for mankind to conquer the universe and live a better life. The choice between these two is so obvious and so urgent that many people who have never participated in peace activities are now calling for peace. Recent public opinion polls in Western countries show that the majority of people advocate negotiations with the Soviet Union to ease the situation. Many heads of government and prominent social figures have also joined the ranks of calling for peace. It is this irresistible powerful trend that was reflected in the recent United Nations General Assembly, which unanimously adopted a resolution advocating peaceful coexistence. It is this trend that forced the recent Paris meeting of the heads of state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to shift from the original main topic of strengthening military preparations to discussing Bulganin's proposal, and to express in the meeting's declaration and communiqué its "willingness to resolve international issues through consultation." It is also this trend that has led British Prime Minister Macmillan to sing the tune of concluding a non-aggression treaty, and has forced US President Eisenhower, even if he has no sincerity, to talk about "peace work."

The US government and its followers also know that their policy of continuing the Cold War and the arms race while resisting high-level talks is very unpopular, so they have to rack their brains to come up with excuses to cover up their policies. They say that the West must catch up with the Soviet Union in military strength in order to have safe and equal negotiations. They say that holding top-level talks at the moment will not be beneficial. But these sophistical "reasons" are completely untenable.

Everyone remembers that for a long period of time in the past, when the West was particularly complacent in boasting about its military superiority, the Western group did not seriously seek consultation and peace. On the contrary, that was the time when they clamored for war the most and East-West relations were the most tense. They once described the Soviet Union's efforts at that time to reach a disarmament agreement as an attempt to eliminate Western military superiority. Now, when the so-called "military superiority" has been lost, they are as stubbornly opposed to disarmament, opposed to peaceful consultation, and opposed to peaceful coexistence as they were in the past, demanding an acceleration of the arms race and demanding "arming first before negotiating." The monopoly groups in the United States and Britain are trying to tie the people of Western countries to a merry-go-round, always revolving around the arms race. One cannot help but ask, if disarmament can really eliminate military superiority, why are Western countries now afraid to reach a disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union and eliminate Soviet military superiority?

As for saying that holding East-West top-level talks is not beneficial at the moment, that is just an excuse from Western countries, because they are afraid that holding East-West top-level talks will, like the last Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, lead to an easing of the international situation. Facts have proven that the most effective way to solve urgent international problems is through direct contact between the leaders of the relevant countries—here, first and foremost, the major powers of East and West. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the talks, it is possible not to solve all the problems in one meeting, but to select the most pressing and fully amenable problems to solve, and seek a partial agreement in order to create a favorable atmosphere for the next step of the solution. The Soviet proposal suggests: immediately stop nuclear testing, ban the use of atomic weapons, establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, sign a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Alliance countries and the Warsaw Treaty countries, reduce the foreign troops stationed on German territory, expand international trade relations, ban war propaganda, and agree that major countries will not violate the independence of Middle Eastern countries and will not use force on issues related to the Middle East. These are all urgent problems that can be solved immediately. Solving these problems will not harm the interests of any country, but will immediately help to ease the situation, reduce the danger of war, and increase international trust and security, which will also help to solve other outstanding issues, including complete disarmament, complete abolition of atomic weapons, and even major issues such as the reunification of Germany. It is obvious that if the Western governments truly wish to seek an East-West agreement to stop the arms race and ease the international situation as they have stated, there should be no reason to disagree with holding high-level talks as soon as possible to reach an agreement on the current pressing issues.

The widespread welcome that the Soviet Union's new proposal has received, and the universal criticism of Eisenhower's State of the Union Address issued on the same day, are sufficient to illustrate the direction of popular sentiment. The peace-loving forces of the world now have full confidence to force the war planners to succumb to the will of the people: hold East-West top-level talks to promote peaceful coexistence.

### 举行高级会谈促进和平

    举行高级会谈促进和平
    用行动来缓和国际紧张局势，还是空口唱裁军高调，这是衡量一个国家是否真正有和平诚意的标准。用这个标准，人们看到苏联和以美国为首的西方大国之间两种截然不同的情况。
    苏联政府在几天以前宣布裁减武装部队三十万人，其中有四万多人将从德意志民主共和国境内撤退并复员。1月9日，苏联政府又一次向美、英以及其他十几个国家政府提出和平建议，主张在两三个月内举行有华沙条约和北大西洋公约双方国家以及一些不参加军事集团和执行和平政策的国家如印度、阿富汗、埃及、南斯拉夫、瑞典、奥地利等参加的最高级会议，就国际局势中当前最迫切而又完全有条件可以解决的一些重大问题达成协议，以改善国际局势，创造有利于通过和平协商而不是通过军备竞赛和战争的办法来解决国际争端的气氛，便于进一步就其他悬而未决的重大国际问题找出协议的道路。
    在1955年苏美英法四国首脑日内瓦会议以后，苏联本着用实际行动来缓和局势和促进和平的精神，已经是第三次单方面裁减它的武装部队，使得裁减的总数超过二百万。苏联还逐年削减了它的国防费用，使得军费在国家预算支出中所占的比重从1955年的20％下降到1957年的16％。在采取这些实际行动的同时，苏联多次提出了改善国际局势和停止军备竞赛的具体建议。苏联这种坚持不渝的努力，表现了苏联的和平诚意，这决不是西方国家用“宣传花招”几个字所抹煞得了的。
    就在苏联继新的具体行动之后又提出新的积极性建议的同一天，人们却看到西方国家空谈和平的最近一个典型例子。这就是美国总统艾森豪威尔发表了他的一年一度的国情咨文。在这个咨文里他说：“对于面临的重大问题只有一个解决办法。世界必须停止目前从事制造越来越多的毁灭性武器的冒险，并且改变方向。”假如美国总统果真按照他自己的这个宣告来行动，那末全世界都会欢迎。但是，当人们仔细看完美国总统的咨文时，很难相信美国总统的这个宣告含有任何真正的诚意。虽然艾森豪威尔强调他今年的咨文将集中谈和平的问题，但是实际上却以最大部分鼓吹加强军事实力，要求支出更多的军费，要人民为此作出更多的牺牲。而关于和平，正如一个美国议员所说的，咨文中没有提出任何积极的建议。咨文甚至对于布尔加宁的建议只字不提，虽然这是当前全世界最广泛地议论和最急切地期待美国对之采取积极态度的问题。
    艾森豪威尔的国情咨文如果说是为了表示美国政府的和平意愿，倒不如说是表明美国政府仍然坚持冷战和军备竞赛的政策。进一步增加军事预算和对东西方高级会谈采取消极态度，同真正谋求缓和国际局势和加强和平的诚意，没有丝毫共同之点。艾森豪威尔继续散布的反苏谰言也丝毫无助于改善国际关系，而只能毒化国际气氛。美国政府的实际行动只能使人认定它无意缓和局势，不愿停止军备竞赛，反对和平共处。
    最近两年来，西方国家政府首脑也装模作样地谈论和平，但是它们的行动却是加紧军备竞赛和战争准备。北大西洋集团的军费，在过去两年中间又增加了约5％，1957年总额达到近六百亿美元。其中主要的是美国，它把每年预算支出的大部分用于军备和军事集团上面。同时，西方国家用各种方法使裁军谈判无法获得进展。它们还利用联合国里的多数，以一种不接受就拉倒的方式，要苏联接受西方国家的无理条件，实际上想关死裁军谈判的大门。西方国家的这一切活动，一再掀起反和平的逆流，使国际局势恶化，同全世界人民要求减轻军备负担和消除战争威胁的热切愿望背道而驰。
    但是形势没有朝着冷战策划者所希望的方向发展。他们想关死谈判的大门的作法已证明是不得人心的。
    洲际导弹和人造卫星的出现，已向全世界提出了这样一个根本性的问题：如果让冷战和军备竞赛继续下去，它将导致一次空前规模的战争。在这次战争中，世界上没有一片地方是安全的，而且所造成的破坏和毁灭将是极其巨大的。如果制止冷战，把各国目前用于军备竞赛的人力物力用于促进社会的进步和改善人民的生活，那末，人造卫星所显示的科学进步将为人类开辟征服宇宙和美好生活的灿烂前景。这两者之间的选择是如此明显而又如此紧迫，使得许多从来不参加和平活动的人现在都出来呼吁和平了。西方各国最近的民意测验表明，主张同苏联谈判缓和局势的人占压倒的多数。许多国家的政府首脑和有名望的社会人士也参加到呼吁和平的行列里来了。正是这一股势不可当的强大潮流，反映到不久前的联合国大会里，全体一致通过了主张和平共处的决议。正是这股潮流，迫使上月北大西洋公约国家首脑巴黎会议，从原定的加强军事准备的主要议题，转过来讨论布尔加宁的建议，并且在会议的宣言和公报中表示“愿意通过商谈来解决国际问题”。也是这股潮流，使得英国首相麦克米伦唱出缔结互不侵犯协定的调子，使美国总统艾森豪威尔纵然毫无诚意，也不得不在谈论“和平工作”。
    美国政府和它的追随者也知道，他们继续进行冷战和军备竞赛而抵制高级会谈的政策是十分不得人心的，因此他们不得不挖空心思想出一些借口来为它们的政策打掩护。他们说，西方必须在军事力量上赶上苏联才能有安全和平等的谈判。他们说，在目前举行最高级的会谈不会有好处。但是这些诡辩的“理由”都是完全经不住一驳的。
    大家记得，在过去很长时期里，当西方特别洋洋自得地吹嘘它们的军事优势的时候，西方集团丝毫没有认真地寻求协商和和平，恰恰相反，那个时候，正是它们叫嚣战争最凶和东西方关系最为紧张的时候。他们曾经把苏联当时谋求达成裁军协议的努力，说成是想取消西方军事优势。现在，当所谓“军事优势”已经丧失了之后，他们也像过去一样固执地反对裁军，反对和平协商，反对和平共处，而要求加速军备竞赛，要求“武装起来再进行谈判”。美国和英国的垄断集团，企图把西方国家的人民绑在走马灯上，总是围绕着军备竞赛转来转去。人们不禁要问，如果裁军真的可以取消军事优势，为什么西方国家现在不敢同苏联达成裁军协议，取消苏联的军事优势呢？
    至于说东西方最高级会谈目前召开没有好处，那只是西方国家的遁词，因为他们害怕，举行东西方最高级会谈会像上次日内瓦四国首脑会议那样使得国际局势趋向于缓和。事实证明，解决国际上紧迫的问题的最有效办法，就是有关国家——在这里首先是东西方大国——的领导人物的直接接触。为了使得会谈能够顺利进行，可以在一次会谈中不去解决所有的问题，而选择当前最迫切而又完全有条件解决的问题，求得一部分协议，以便为下一步的解决创造有利气氛。苏联建议中提出：立即停止核试验，禁止使用原子武器，在中欧建立无原子武器地区，北大西洋联盟国家和华沙条约国家之间签订互不侵犯条约，缩减外国驻扎在德国领土上的军队，扩大国际贸易关系，禁止战争宣传，大国约定不侵犯中东国家独立和不在中东有关问题上使用武力。这些都是当前马上可以解决的紧迫问题。解决这些问题不会损及任何国家的利益，而能够马上有助于缓和局势，减轻战争危险，增加国际的信任和安全感，从而也将有助于解决其他悬而未决的问题，包括全面裁军，完全废除原子武器，以至于像德国恢复统一这样的重大问题。显而易见，如果西方国家政府果真像它们所声明的那样愿意谋求东西方协议来停止军备竞赛和缓和国际局势，就不应当再有什么理由不同意尽速举行高级会谈，就当前紧迫的问题达成协议。
    苏联的新建议发表后所受到的广泛欢迎，和艾森豪威尔在同一天发表的国情咨文所受到的普遍责难，足以说明人心向背。全世界爱好和平的力量现在有充分的信心，来迫使战争策划者屈从人民的意志：举行东西方最高级会谈，促进和平共处。
