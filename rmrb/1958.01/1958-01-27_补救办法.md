Notes

    A Remedy
    The pro-government West German newspaper "General-Anzeiger" complains that the current foreign policy debate in the Bundestag features repetitive speeches, and the results are known in advance, failing to advance matters in any way. The remedy proposed by this newspaper is: to limit future debates to a small circle, with "clever" members of each party conducting their arguments without loudspeakers.
    Parliamentary debate in a capitalist system is, by its very nature, a hypocritical formality. This has always been the case, so why does the "General-Anzeiger" now have an opinion? From the method proposed by this newspaper and the timing of its publication, it is not difficult to see that this is because the people of West Germany are increasingly yearning for peace, causing the Adenauer government's policies to recently come under fierce criticism in parliament; therefore, the "General-Anzeiger" has come out to advocate that even this hypocritical "democratic" form of public debate should simply be discarded.

### 补救办法

    补救办法
    西德亲政府的“总汇报”埋怨目前联邦议院的外交政策辩论发言内容重复，而结果又是事先就知道的，不能使事情有任何进展。这家报纸提出的补救办法是：把今后的辩论限制在一个小圈子里，由各个党“聪明的”议员不用扩音机来进行他们的争论。
    资本主义的议会辩论，本来就是一种虚伪的形式。情况历来如此，为什么“总汇报”现在有起意见来了呢？从这家报纸所提的办法和发表这个意见的时机，不难看出，这是因为，西德的人心越来越向往于和平，使得阿登纳政府的政策最近在议会里受到了猛烈的抨击；于是，就让“总汇报”出来主张，最好公开辩论这种虚伪的“民主”形式也干脆丢掉。
