    Still, Be a Little Calmer
    William Rian, an Associated Press reporter who has always engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda, said in a telegram that Macmillan's suggestion of "signing a treaty of non-aggression between the East and West" made the Soviet Union "feel embarrassed." He believes that the British Prime Minister's move is "the first real challenge to Moscow in months," and it "seems to have frightened the Kremlin."
    Rian's blind anti-Soviet instinct has hit a rock again this time. He doesn't even know that the proposal to sign a treaty of non-aggression between East and West was first put forward by the Soviet Union. The British Prime Minister responded to this proposal not out of sincerity, which can only be said to be a "challenge" to the US Cold War policy. Therefore, the US officialdom showed extreme indifference to Macmillan's remarks. Rian's praise of Macmillan didn't hit others' sore spots, but precisely hit the US's sore spot.
    One can only advise this anti-Soviet expert: Still, be a little calmer!

    还是冷静点吧
    一向进行反苏宣传的美联社记者威廉·瑞安在一则电讯中说，麦克米伦的“签订东西方互不侵犯条约”的建议使苏联“感到为难”。他认为英国首相的此举是“几个月来对莫斯科的第一次真正的挑战”，它“似乎吓坏了克里姆林宫”。
    瑞安的盲目的反苏本能这回又碰到岩石上了。他甚至不知道，关于签订东西方互不侵犯条约的建议，首先是由苏联提出的。英国首相并非出于真意地响应这个主张，这只能说是对美国的冷战政策的一个“挑战”。因而，美国官方对麦克米伦的言论，表现了极度的冷淡。瑞安对麦克米伦的表扬不是戳到了别人的痛处，而恰恰是戳到了美国的痛处。
    人们只能奉劝这位反苏专家：还是头脑冷静一点吧！
