Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: Mr. Willens, the defense lawyer for Mr. Powell, the former editor of the Shanghai Millard's Review, presented his passport to the responsible official at our border inspection station when entering the country from Shenzhen yesterday afternoon. The U.S. State Department had written on Mr. Willens' passport, referring to the People's Republic of China as "those parts of China under Communist control." The Chinese official immediately pointed out to the passport holder that this wording on the passport by the U.S. government was an act of hostility towards China. Such a passport is unacceptable. He said, however, considering that this was not the passport holder's fault, and to show consideration for Mr. Willens' long journey, we made a special exception and issued a separate visa, permitting entry.

Furthermore, the passports of the American dependents of criminals who entered the country on the same day as Mr. Willens also contained similar hostile language towards China. The responsible official at the Chinese border inspection station also made the above-mentioned representations to them.

    美国发给威林等人的护照上有敌视我国辞句
    我边防检查站不接受美方护照另行发给签证
    新华社广州7日电　前上海密勒氏评论报主笔鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林先生昨天下午从深圳入境时向我国边防检查站的负责官员缴验了他的护照。美国国务院在威林先生的护照上把中华人民共和国称为“在共产党控制下的中国各部分”。中国官员当即向持照人指出：美国政府在护照上的这种写法，是敌视中国的行为。这种护照是不能接受的。他说，但是，考虑到这不是持照人的过错，为了体谅威林先生远道前来，我们特予通融，发给另纸签证，准予入境。
    又讯，在同威林先生同日入境的美犯家属的护照上，同样注有敌视中国的词句。中国边防检查站负责官员也曾向他们作了上述表示。
