Notes

    "Survival" and the Moneybag
    American oil magnate Rockefeller, in a television program broadcast to the entire United States, boasted that military plans should "override all other considerations," even if it leads to the country's financial deficit. He demanded that military spending be increased at an "accelerated" rate, with a massive increase of nearly $30 billion over four years. According to him, this is necessary for the "survival" of the United States.

    In essence, what Rockefeller calls the "survival" of the United States is the moneybag of the monopoly capitalists. The American economy is brewing a serious crisis, and the monopoly capital groups urgently need a large number of military orders to stimulate the recessionary economic activity.

    Rockefeller personally came forward to speak for this reason.

    “生存”和钱口袋
    美国石油大王洛克菲勒在向美国全国广播的电视节目中鼓吹说，军事计划应当“压倒其他一切考虑”，即使因此要造成国家的财政赤字也好。他要求以“累进的”速度来增加军事开支，在四年的时间里就要增加近三百亿美元的庞大数目。据他说，这是美国为了“生存”所必需的。
    说穿了，洛克菲勒所谓的美国的“生存”就是垄断资本家的钱口袋。现在美国经济正在酝酿一次严重的危机，垄断资本集团急需要一大笔军事订货来刺激衰退中的经济活动。
    洛克菲勒亲自出来讲话，也就是为了这个缘故。
