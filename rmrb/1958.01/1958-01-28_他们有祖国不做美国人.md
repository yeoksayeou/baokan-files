Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 27th: Four foreign students invited to participate in a debate organized by the "New York Herald Tribune" said on a television program today that they only want to be citizens of their own countries and do not want to be Americans.

The moderator of the debate asked four middle school students from Egypt, Malaya, Thailand, and Greece a question: "Would you like to be Americans?" All four middle school students answered in unison: "No."

Thai student Saro said that if being an American means "not respecting parents and teachers, then I would rather be a barbarian."

Malayan student Suan said that she was sure the "American way of life" was not suitable for her.

Egyptian student Ahmed said he didn't want to give up "Egypt's great civilization and splendid culture."

Greek Angiliki said that Americans only want others to praise them.
