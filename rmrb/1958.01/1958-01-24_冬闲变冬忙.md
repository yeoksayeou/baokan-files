    Winter Leisure Turns to Winter Busyness
    Kong Fusheng
    [Kong Fusheng (poor peasant), a record keeper of the Eighth Team of Shujiang Cooperative in Guandu Township, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, studied in a private school for two years. After the cooperative completed the tasks of vigorously developing water conservancy and carrying out fertilizer accumulation campaigns, he wrote two poems to report the good news to the cadres.]
    Winter leisure is turned into winter busyness, weeds are swept away, the fields turn green, and not an inch of wasteland remains on the sandbars and slopes; the cooperative members engage in production, bravely rushing to the battlefield, working diligently for what? To produce a thousand catties of grain.
    The winter scene is like the spring scenery in Shujiang Cooperative, every household is busy with production, a bustling scene of production, calling it daylight at three in the morning. [Note] The withered and yellow fields turn green, the sleeping green mountains are re-dressed, the earth already has the intention of returning to spring, only lacking the east wind to send the fragrance of flowers. [Note] A positive element in the cooperative, seeing the moonlight in the middle of the night, mistakenly thought it was dawn, so he got up and called people to work.

    冬闲变冬忙
    孔福生
    〔湖南省浏阳县官渡乡书江社第八队记工员孔福生（贫农），读过两年私塾。在这个社完成大兴水利和开展积肥运动的任务后，他写了两首诗，向干部报喜。〕
    冬忙冬闲变冬忙，杂草一扫光，田园转青色，洲坡无寸荒；社员搞生产，奋勇奔战场，勤劳为何事，要产千斤粮。
    冬景春色书江社里好风光，家家户户生产忙，热火朝天闹生产，三更半夜叫天光。〔注〕枯黄田园变绿色，已睡青山又换装，大地早有回春意，只少东风送花香。〔注〕社里有个积极分子，看到半夜的月色，误以为天亮，就起床叫人出工。
