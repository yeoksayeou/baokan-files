    The most deep-rooted things about a person’s ideological feelings are that they will consciously or unconsciously be revealed at any time and any place, and that is what is called "natural expression." If what is expressed is the ideological feeling of the proletariat, then of course that is very good; the problem is that many intellectuals now are always expressing the ideological feelings of the bourgeoisie. This kind of ideological feeling is incompatible with the laboring people, so it must be changed. Letting intellectuals go to the countryside to temper themselves is precisely for this purpose.

    Can going down to the countryside change bourgeois ideological feelings? Some people have given a negative answer. According to their view, peasants are not an advanced class, they are selfish and short-sighted; and intellectuals have generally joined trade unions for many years and are already part of the working class, so there is no reason to learn from peasants. Moreover, labor is the same everywhere. Working in an office is also labor, and it is high-level, complex labor, while agricultural labor is low-level and simple. Abandoning high-level labor to go to low-level labor for tempering, and letting intellectuals with professional knowledge engage in physical labor, does not make sense in principle and is actually a waste.

    There are many such reasons, but in fact there are only two sentences: first, peasants are selfish and backward; second, physical labor is low-level and not worth learning. This is a typical bourgeois ideological feeling: first, looking down on physical labor, and second, looking down on physical laborers.

    What we mean by changing bourgeois ideological feelings is precisely to change this ideological feeling of looking down on physical labor and physical laborers.

    When it comes to changing ideological feelings, some comrades always feel that it is a bit general, not easy to grasp, or even mysterious. In fact, there is nothing mysterious about it. The bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes exploit the blood and sweat of the laboring people, squander it wantonly, and in turn falsely accuse peasants of being selfish; they monopolize the right to education and other rights, and in turn slander the laboring people as ignorant, and they instill their views of the laboring people into intellectuals in various ways. Thus, they build a wall between intellectuals and the laboring people, and dig a ditch. The so-called changing ideological feelings is to tear down this wall, fill in this ditch, and let intellectuals go from that side to this side, to understand the essence of peasants and other laboring people. As long as we truly abandon the set of views instilled by the bourgeoisie that slander the laboring people, and establish a correct view of the laboring people, then we have changed our ideological feelings, from the standpoint of the exploiting class to the standpoint of the proletariat.

    No one opposes changing bourgeois ideological feelings in words. However, there are doubts, and there are also disputes. Doubts and disputes often focus on this point: is it necessary to go down to the countryside and up to the mountains to participate in physical labor and live with peasants? Can't education be effective? According to some people, since bourgeois ideological feelings are instilled into intellectuals through bourgeois education, then it is of course possible to change this ideological feeling by reading Marxist theoretical books, so it is not necessary to go down to the countryside and up to the mountains.

    The bourgeois ideological feelings of intellectuals are not only the result of bourgeois education; their family economic status and social environment also have a great influence. Regardless of the source of bourgeois ideological feelings, to change it, one must understand the ideological feelings of the laboring people. To understand the ideological feelings of the laboring people, reading books certainly has a great effect, but it is impossible to achieve the goal by relying solely on books. One must go among the laboring people, live with them, and struggle with them. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that "cognition begins with practice" and that "all genuine knowledge originates from direct experience." Comrade Mao Zedong introduced his experience of emotional changes, proving that it is necessary to be with the laboring people in order to understand the feelings of the laboring people and change bourgeois feelings. He said: "After the revolution, when I was with the workers, peasants, and revolutionary army soldiers, I gradually became familiar with them, and they gradually became familiar with me. Only then, only at this time, did I fundamentally change the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feelings that the bourgeois school had taught me." People can understand each other in various ways, but the easiest way for people to understand each other is through common struggle. In the past, the main task was to make revolution, so we had to struggle against the enemy together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; now, the main task is to engage in construction, so we should naturally engage in production together with the laboring people. As for some people engaged in special businesses who cannot participate in physical labor, they should also go to the countryside, up to the mountains, and down to the factories to directly serve the laboring people and directly contact the laboring people. Otherwise, it is also impossible to understand the laboring people.

    From the above quotation of Comrade Mao Zedong, we can also realize that if we go to the countryside to understand peasants with a cold eye, there will be no good results. To truly understand peasants, we must also let peasants understand us. That is what Comrade Mao Zedong said, "I gradually became familiar with them, and they gradually became familiar with me." If an intellectual cannot be understood by the laboring people, he cannot hear the truth from the laboring people, and therefore cannot truly understand the laboring people, and will still be incompatible with the laboring people. Therefore, it is not only necessary to go down to the countryside and up to the mountains to labor and live with peasants, but also to understand each other with peasants and become intimate friends.

    Living and laboring in the countryside, and having intimate peasant friends, we can slowly understand peasants, establish the ideological feelings of the laboring people, and abandon the bourgeois ideological feelings.

    谈思想感情的变化
    崔蒙
    人的思想感情，最是根深蒂固的东西，随时随地都会自觉不自觉地流露出来，这就是所谓“自然流露”了。如果流露的是无产阶级的思想感情，那当然很好；问题是现在的许多知识分子，老是流露资产阶级的思想感情，这种思想感情同劳动人民格格不入，所以非改变不可。让知识分子到农村锻炼，也正是为了这个目的。
    下放到农村，能不能改变资产阶级的思想感情呢？有些人作了否定的回答。据他们的看法，农民不是先进的阶级，自私自利，眼光短浅；而知识分子一般都加入工会多年，已经是工人阶级的一部分了，没有理由向农民学习。何况劳动到处都是一样，机关工作也是劳动，而且是高级的复杂的劳动，农业劳动却是低级的简单的，放弃高级劳动而到低级劳动中去锻炼，让有专业知识的知识分子从事体力劳动，道理上说不通，实际上也是浪费。
    这样的理由叙述起来多得很，其实只有两句话：第一，农民自私自利，落后；第二，体力劳动是低级的，不值得学习的。这是典型的资产阶级的思想感情，第一，轻视体力劳动，第二，轻视体力劳动者。
    我们所说的改变资产阶级的思想感情，正是改变这种轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的思想感情。
    谈到改变思想感情，有些同志总觉得有点儿笼统，不大好捉摸，或者说，有些神秘。其实，这没有什么神秘。资产阶级以及其他剥削阶级剥削了劳动人民的血汗，挥霍无度，反过来诬指农民自私自利；他们垄断了受教育权以及其他的权利，反过来诬蔑劳动人民愚昧，并且把他们这一套对劳动人民的看法，通过各种方式，灌输给知识分子。于是，他们就在知识分子和劳动人民之间筑起了一道墙，挖开了一条沟。所谓改变思想感情，就是要拆掉这道墙，填平这条沟，让知识分子从那边到这边，认识农民以及其他劳动人民的本质。只要真正抛弃了资产阶级灌输的那一套诬蔑劳动人民的观点，建立了对劳动人民的正确观点，这就是改变了思想感情，从剥削阶级立场转到了无产阶级立场。
    改变资产阶级的思想感情，没有人在口头上反对。然而怀疑是有的，争论也是有的，怀疑和争论往往集中在这一点上：是不是非下乡上山参加体力劳动，同农民一起生活不可？教育的方法不是满能奏效的么？据有些人的意见，资产阶级的思想感情，既然是通过资产阶级教育灌输给知识分子的，当然也可以通过阅读马克思主义的理论书籍，来改变这种思想感情，就不一定下乡上山了。
    知识分子的资产阶级思想感情，不只是资产阶级教育的结果，他们的家庭经济地位和社会环境，都有很大的影响。不论资产阶级思想感情的来源如何，要改变它，就非了解劳动人民的思想感情不可。要了解劳动人民的思想感情，读书当然有很大的作用，然而单凭书本是达不到目的的，必须到劳动人民当中去，同他们一起生活，一起斗争。毛泽东同志教导说，“认识从实践始”，“一切真知都是从直接经验发源的”。毛泽东同志介绍过他的感情变化的经验，证明必须同劳动人民在一起，才有可能了解劳动人民的感情，改变资产阶级的感情。他说：“革命了，同工人农民和革命军的战士在一起了，我逐渐熟悉他们，他们也逐渐熟悉了我。这时，只是在这时，我才根本地改变了资产阶级学校所教给我的那种资产阶级的和小资产阶级的感情。”人们可以通过各种各样的方式互相了解，但最容易使人们互相了解的还是共同的斗争。过去，主要的任务是搞革命，所以必须同工农兵一起对敌人斗争；现在，主要的任务是搞建设，自然应当同劳动人民一起搞生产了。至于某些从事特殊业务的人，不能参加体力劳动，也应当下乡、上山、下厂，为劳动人民直接服务，同劳动人民直接接触，否则，也不可能了解劳动人民。
    从上引毛泽东同志的那段话里，我们还可以体会到，如果到了农村，冷眼旁观地去了解农民，也是不会有好的结果的。要真正了解农民，还一定要让农民了解我们。就是毛泽东同志说的，“我逐渐熟悉他们，他们也逐渐熟悉了我”。如果一个知识分子不能被劳动人民了解，他就不可能从劳动人民那里听到真心话，因而也就不可能真正了解劳动人民，而依然同劳动人民格格不入。所以不仅要下乡上山，同农民劳动和生活在一起，而且还必须同农民互相了解，成为知心朋友。
    生活和劳动在农村，又有知心的农民朋友，我们就能够慢慢地了解农民，建立劳动人民的思想感情，而抛弃掉资产阶级的思想感情。
