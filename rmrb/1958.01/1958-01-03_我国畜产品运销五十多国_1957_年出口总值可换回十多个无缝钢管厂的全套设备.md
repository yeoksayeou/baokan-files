China's Animal Products Sold to Over Fifty Countries
1957 Export Value Can Be Exchanged for Complete Equipment for More Than Ten Seamless Steel Tube Plants

(Our Newspaper) News: Animal products occupy an important position in the country's export trade. The total value of animal products exported by the country in 1957 is expected to be exchanged for more than 1.1 million tons of steel. If exchanged for factory equipment, it would be equivalent to importing complete equipment for more than ten seamless steel tube plants. In this year, the state paid farmers and herdsmen approximately 400 million yuan for purchasing animal products, which can buy 4 billion jin of grain. If calculated based on an average consumption of one jin of grain per person per day, it can feed 500 million farmers nationwide for eight days.

Currently, China exports a total of 150 to 160 types of animal products. In 1957, they were sold to 55 countries.

In recent years, the production of animal products in China has continuously increased. Compared to 1952, in 1957, wool increased by 69%, sheepskin increased by 80%, cashmere increased by 81%, cowhide increased by 75%, goatskin increased by 75%, sable skin increased by 21%, and other products also experienced varying degrees of increase. At the same time, the state's purchasing work has gradually deepened in various production areas, greatly reducing the loss and waste of animal products. In the past five years, the state has paid a total of 1.6 billion yuan to farmers for purchasing animal products, of which 450 million yuan was increased income for farmers and herdsmen due to increased production and in-depth purchasing.

With the development of China's light industry, many manufactured animal products have also been exported in the past two years, such as pig bristle brushes, leather shoes, leather suitcases, and various leather goods. These manufactured products are generally welcomed in foreign markets. In 1957, the export value of various leather manufactured products accounted for approximately 9% of the total export value of all animal products.

Now is the peak season for the production and purchasing of animal products. It is estimated that the number of hunters organized nationwide in the winter of 1957 is approximately 200,000, an increase of approximately 30,000 compared to the previous year. It is expected that the production of wild animal pelts will have a certain increase. This year's state investment plan for purchasing animal products will also increase by 12% compared to 1957.

Approximately 70% of the animal products purchased by the state are supplied for export. However, the animal products supplied to the domestic market this year will also increase by 8.7% compared to 1957.

In order to develop the production of valuable pelts in a planned way, the state established three wild animal breeding farms in Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Guizhou in 1957, based on the Soviet Union's experience, to try raising five species that produce valuable pelts, such as coypu, mink, arctic fox, muskrat, and silver fox. The results were good. (Song Keqiang)

    我国畜产品运销五十多国
    1957年出口总值可换回十多个无缝钢管厂的全套设备
    本报讯　畜产品在国家出口贸易中占有重要地位，1957年国家出口的畜产品总价值，预计可换回一百一十多万吨钢材。如换工厂设备，就相当于进口十多个无缝钢管厂的全套设备。这一年国家通过收购畜产品付给农牧民的钱约四亿多元，可买原粮四十亿斤。如果按每人每天平均吃粮一斤计算，可供全国五亿农民吃八天。
    现在我国出口的畜产品共有一百五、六十种。1957年共销往五十五个国家。
    几年来，我国畜产品的生产不断增长。1957年比1952年绵羊毛增加了69％，绵羊皮增加了80％，羊绒增加了81％，牛皮增加了75％，山羊板皮增加了75％，黄狼皮增加了21％，其他产品也都有不同程度的增加。与此同时，国家收购工作也逐步深入各产区，大大减少了畜产品的损失和浪费。五年来，国家在收购畜产品中共付给农民十六亿元，其中因产量增加，深入收购而使农牧民增加的收入就达四亿五千万元。
    随着我国轻工业的发展，近两年来也出口了许多畜产品的制成品，如猪鬃刷子、皮鞋、皮箱、各种皮件等。这些制成品在国外市场普遍受到欢迎。1957年各种皮革制成品出口的价值约占全部畜产品出口总值的9％。
    现在正是畜产品的生产、收购旺季。据估计，1957年冬季全国组织起来的猎民约有二十万人，比前年增加约三万人。预计野生皮张的生产将有一定数量的增长。今年国家收购畜产品资金的投放计划，也将比1957年增加12％。
    国家收购的畜产品有70％左右是供应出口。但供应国内市场的畜产品今年也将比1957年增加8.7％。
    国家为了有计划地发展贵重皮张的生产，根据苏联的经验，1957年在黑龙江、山东、贵州建立了三个野牲饲养场，试养了出产贵重皮张的海狸鼠、水貂、北极狐、麝鼠、银狐等五种。结果良好。（宋克强）
