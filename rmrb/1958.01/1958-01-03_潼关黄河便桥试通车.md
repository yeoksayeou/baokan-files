Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 1st: The Tongguan Yellow River provisional bridge, connecting the Longhai and Nantongpu Railways, held a trial opening ceremony on January 1st and began undertaking transportation tasks.

Construction of the Tongguan Yellow River provisional bridge began in July 1957 and was fully completed by December 30th. During the bridge construction process, the workers saved a large amount of steel for the country.

Shaanxi and Shanxi were separated by the Yellow River, making transportation very inconvenient. For generations, wooden boats were used for ferrying from Fenglingdu, which was risky and had a very small transportation capacity. After the completion of the Tongguan Yellow River provisional bridge, the coal needed in the Shaanxi area and the large amount of materials transported from the Northwest to Shanxi will no longer need to bypass the Jinghan Line and the Shitai Line via the Longhai Road. This will greatly shorten the transportation distance.

    潼关黄河便桥试通车
    据新华社西安1日电　沟通陇海和南同蒲铁路的潼关黄河便桥1日举行试通车仪式，并开始担负运输任务。
    潼关黄河便桥工程是在1957年7月动工的，到12月30日全部完工。职工们在建桥过程中，为国家节省了大量钢料。
    陕西、山西因被黄河隔开，交通很不方便。历代都是用木船从风陵渡摆渡，风险大而运输量极小。潼关黄河便桥建成以后，陕西地区所需的煤和西北运往山西的大量物资，就不再经陇海路绕京汉线、石太线，这就将大大缩短了运输里程。
