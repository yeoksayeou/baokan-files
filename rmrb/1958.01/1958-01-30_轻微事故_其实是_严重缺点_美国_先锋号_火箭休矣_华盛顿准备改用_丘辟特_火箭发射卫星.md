    "Minor Accident" is Actually a "Serious Defect"
    The US "Vanguard" Rocket Bites the Dust
    Washington Prepares to Use "Jupiter" Rocket to Launch Satellites
    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, Washington Dispatch: According to a January 28th report by Agence France-Presse, the US government has disappointedly and temporarily abandoned its plan to launch an American "artificial satellite" using the "Vanguard" rocket. The "Vanguard" launch facility at Cape Canaveral has already begun dismantling.
    The reporter said that although Washington officials have remained silent about the failed "Vanguard" test last week, well-informed sources revealed that the frustration within the government caused by this failure is actually no less than that of December 6th of last year.
    The reporter said that "serious defects" were discovered in the second stage of the rocket during dismantling, while American officials had described the rocket's failure to launch successfully as due to a "minor accident." The reporter also said that in last week's test, an expert named Donald Roxbury was burned on the head and shoulders by the rocket's fuel, and the injuries were quite serious.
    The report said that the US government is now preparing to use the Army's "Jupiter" rocket to launch the "artificial satellite."
    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th, New York Dispatch: "New York World-Telegram" reporter Fred Speak reported on January 27th that US President Eisenhower had been prepared three times in the past week to announce "in the most dramatic way" that the United States had successfully launched an artificial Earth satellite, but the news of continuous problems with the "Vanguard" rocket from Cape Canaveral shattered his hopes.
    Speak said that the White House regarded the anticipated success of the American satellite launch as "an eagerly awaited psychological weapon." The President had hoped that he "could make a phone call to Dulles, who was trying to convince those nervous allies in Ankara, to make them believe that the United States really possessed magical missiles just like the Soviet Union."
    The reporter said that in the past week, people at Cape Canaveral were shouting everywhere, "We must get the American satellite into space this week!" As a result, the continuous failures of the "Vanguard" rocket caused "one hundred percent crisis and the most dismal frustration" at the test site.

### “轻微事故”其实是“严重缺点”  美国“先锋号”火箭休矣  华盛顿准备改用“丘辟特”火箭发射卫星

    “轻微事故”其实是“严重缺点”
    美国“先锋号”火箭休矣
    华盛顿准备改用“丘辟特”火箭发射卫星
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：据法新社记者28日报道，美国政府已经失望地暂时放弃用“先锋号”火箭发射美国“人造卫星”的计划。卡纳维拉尔角的“先锋号”发射装置已经开始卸除。
    这位记者说，华盛顿官员们尽管对上星期“先锋号”试验失败表示沉默，但是消息灵通人士透露，这次失败在政府内所造成的沮丧情绪实际上并不下于去年12月6日的那一次。
    记者说，在拆除中在火箭的第二级发现了“严重的缺点”，而美国官员曾把火箭没有发射成功说成是由于“轻微事故”。记者还说，在上星期试验中，一位名叫唐纳·罗克斯巴里的专家被火箭的燃料烧伤了头部和肩部，而且伤得很严重。
    消息说，现在美国政府正在准备用陆军的“丘辟特”号火箭来发射“人造卫星”。
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：“纽约世界电讯报”记者弗雷德·斯派克27日报道说，美国总统艾森豪威尔在上一个星期内曾经有三次准备“以最富戏剧性的方式”来宣布美国已经成功地发射了一颗人造地球卫星，但是从卡纳维拉尔角传来的“先锋号”火箭连续出毛病的消息把他的希望打破了。
    斯派克说，白宫把期望中的美国卫星发射成功的消息当作“一个迫不及待的心理武器”，总统本来盼望他“可以打一个电话给正在试图说服安卡拉的那些神经有些不安的盟友们的杜勒斯，要它们相信美国也像苏联一样真的拥有神奇的导弹”。
    这位记者说，在上一星期中，卡纳维拉尔角的人到处在叫嚷“我们必须在这个星期把美国卫星送上天去”。结果，“先锋号”火箭的连续失败在试验场造成了“百分之一百的危机和最惨淡的沮丧情绪”。
