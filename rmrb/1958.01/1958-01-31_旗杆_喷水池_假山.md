Flagpole, Fountain, Rockery
　　Railway Ministry Rectification Office, Feng Ying

In order to beautify the grounds, the Railway Science Academy decided to build a beautiful flagpole in front of the new office building. Therefore, many people were assigned to use various steel pipes and iron pipes to make a flagpole twenty-one meters high. In order to make the flagpole strong and durable, and to last forever, a reinforced concrete foundation was laid, and the flagpole was sprayed with tin. Every piece was meticulously crafted, and every aspect was required to be beautiful and elegant. The total cost was 1,188 yuan and 4 fen in Renminbi. After this flagpole, which was taller than a five-story building, was erected, it shone with a silvery-white light in the sun and was indeed beautiful and graceful. Who would have thought that its lifespan would not be long? After only flying the flag once, it was removed. It is said that its location was not good and affected the beauty of the grounds. After some deliberation, a fountain was built in the place where the flagpole was built, and a delicate rockery was installed in the middle of the fountain. What will their fate be in the future?

What is perplexing is that the construction of this beautiful flagpole was personally approved by the leaders, and its removal was also personally approved by the leaders. Didn't he ever think about how much money would be wasted? If the odd change of this 1,188 yuan and 4 fen construction fee were to come out of the leader's own pocket, he might have carefully considered it when wielding the pen.

    旗杆·喷水池·假山
    铁道部整风办公室　冯影
    铁道科学研究院为了院内美观，决定在新建的办公大楼前面修建一座美丽的旗杆。因之，抽出很多人，用各种钢管、铁管制成了一根二十一公尺高的旗杆。为了使旗杆坚固耐久，万古千秋，特用钢筋混凝土打了基础，而且在旗杆上喷上了锡，件件精工细做，样样要求美观大方，前后共花费人民币一千一百八十八元零四分。这个比五层楼房还高的旗杆立起来以后，在阳光下闪烁着银白色的光芒，确是秀丽多姿。谁想它寿命并不长，只挂了一次旗，就把它除掉了，据说它的位置不好，影响院内美观。经过一番斟酌，现在，在修建旗杆的地方又修起一个喷水池，喷水池中间装上了小巧玲珑的假山。那末，它们以后的命运又如何呢？
    使人莫解的是：修建这个美丽的旗杆时，是领导人亲手批准的，除掉时，也是领导人亲自批准的。难道他就没想过要浪费掉多少钱吗？这一千一百八十八元零四分钱的修建费，如果最后的零数是从领导人自己腰包掏出来的话，他在挥动大笔时，也许就要仔细考虑一番了。
