Xinhua News Agency Report: In Guangdong Province's winter production, the peasants' enthusiasm for production is particularly high, and the movement is especially vigorous, in all the places where extensive publicity and debates were conducted on the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft).

To date, 12 million people in Guangdong Province have been投入into winter production. A high tide of winter production, centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, has basically formed. Guangdong Province's water conservancy construction plan has been raised from the initial five million mu to ten million mu, and then to fifteen million mu. Currently, large and medium-sized water conservancy projects have commenced, and the commencement and completion of small-scale water conservancy projects have also reached 40% of the planned number. In the Chaoshan area, where fertilizer accumulation is the highest, an average of 50 dan of fertilizer per mu has been accumulated. In the Shaoguan area, where soil improvement is the most extensive, 400,000 mu of soil have been improved. It is expected that in a very short period, the number of people participating in winter production in Guangdong Province will increase to 15 million.

The experience of Guangdong Province in organizing the high tide of winter production proves that in places where extensive publicity and debates have been conducted on the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), the peasants' thinking becomes more open, they feel they have a future, their confidence is firm, and they work harder. The winter production movement is particularly vigorous. For example, this is the case in Boluo County and the Mapo and Louzhai villages in Huiyang County. They first seized upon the clauses in the National Programme for Agricultural Development that the masses were most concerned about and most interested in for publicity, and put forward requirements in conjunction with the situation of their own township and commune, allowing the masses to conduct free and extensive debates. Secondly, after the debates, they immediately mobilized the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm into the current production, and combined production to deepen the debates. Whether it was free and extensive debate or in-depth debate in conjunction with production, both villages adopted the methods of "big blooming, big contending, big debating" to reflect the various opinions of the masses, especially to fully reflect the negative opinions, and then select typical cases, use facts and reasoning to criticize the right-leaning thoughts and the idleness of the masses, so that the positive and correct opinions overwhelmed the negative and erroneous opinions. In this way, the masses' ideological problems were truly resolved, their production enthusiasm was fully mobilized, and production became a completely conscious act of the broad masses. The peasants repairing water conservancy projects in Mapo Township numbered only six hundred people per day before the great debate, but increased to two thousand four hundred people after the great debate, and the amount of earthwork completed in five days was equal to the work of the past twenty-five days.

According to current statistics, agricultural cooperatives that have initiated a high tide of winter production account for about 50% of the total number of cooperatives in Guangdong Province; agricultural cooperatives that have initially initiated a high tide of production account for about 30%; and only 20% of the agricultural cooperatives are not doing well in production. Among the agricultural cooperatives that have initiated a high tide of production, the most important reason for success, in addition to the good publicity and debate of the National Programme for Agricultural Development and the good mobilization of the masses' thinking, is that the leadership work has kept up closely. The characteristic of this year's winter production is that tens of thousands of peasants eat and live on the water conservancy construction sites, and the personnel are relatively concentrated. The general leadership methods of the past are no longer suitable. The Huiyang Prefectural Committee working group of the Chinese Communist Party conducted publicity on the National Programme for Agricultural Development at the Louzhai Agricultural Cooperative on the construction site, during the masses' work breaks, with very good results. The county party committee offices of Lianjiang, Suixi, Xinyi, and Haikang counties moved to important water conservancy construction sites to work, leading more than eighty township party committees and many community committees to go deep into the construction sites and fields to work, with very good results. This approach has played a very positive role in solving many specific problems brought about by the heavy production tasks, such as adjusting labor organization, strengthening political work, organizing cooperation in all relevant aspects, supplying materials, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience. As for the good influence that the leading comrades gave to the masses politically after arriving at the construction sites and fields, it is even more incalculable.

Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has summarized the above experiences. On the 7th, the Provincial Party Committee also issued instructions, stating that the Central Committee and Chairman Mao had clearly instructed us to launch a discussion of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) among the entire people, especially to launch a great debate in the countryside. The preliminary implementation of these instructions from the Central Committee and Chairman Mao in Guangdong Province proves that these instructions are completely correct. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to more resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and all cooperatives should, without exception, hold a great debate on the National Programme for Agricultural Development in the next half month, in conjunction with production, with ten to fifteen discussions. It is necessary to strive to further criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative thoughts, tap potential, and formulate or revise the long-term and annual production plans of each agricultural cooperative through this debate, so as to promote a further upsurge in the winter production movement.

### 广东省对四十条作过大宣传大辩论的地方  冬季生产运动有声有色

    广东省对四十条作过大宣传大辩论的地方
    冬季生产运动有声有色
    据新华社讯　广东省冬季生产中，凡是就农业发展纲要（修正草案），做过大宣传大辩论的地方，农民生产劲头就特别高，运动来得特别有力。
    到目前止，广东省投入冬季生产的已达一千二百万人。一个以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮已经基本上形成。广东省兴修水利的计划，已经由前期的五百万亩，提高到一千万亩后，再提高到一千五百万亩。现在，大、中型水利工程已经开工，小型水利工程开工和完成的也达到计划数的40％。积肥最多的潮汕地区，每亩已平均积肥五十担，改良土壤最多的韶关专区已改良土壤四十万亩。预料在很短的时间内，广东省参加冬季生产的人数将要增加到一千五百万人。
    广东省组织冬季生产高潮的经验证明，凡是对农业发展纲要（修正草案），做过大宣传大辩论的地方，农民的思想便愈加开朗，感觉到有奔头，信心坚定，更加努力，冬季生产运动来得特别有声有色。譬如博罗县和惠阳县的麻陂、楼寨两村，就是这样。他们首先抓住农业发展纲要中群众最关心、最有兴趣的几条进行宣传，并结合本乡本社的情况提出要求，让群众进行自由大辩论；其次是经过争辩之后，立刻把群众的革命热情调动到当前生产上去，结合生产将辩论引向深入。无论是自由大辩论，或者结合生产深入辩论，这两个村都采取了大鸣、大放、大争的方法，把群众各种各样的意见反映出来，特别是把反面的意见充分反映出来，然后选择典型，通过摆事实、讲道理，批判群众中的右倾思想和游手好闲思想，使积极的和正确的意见压倒消极和错误的意见。这样一来群众的思想问题真正解决了，生产积极性便充分发动起来，生产便完全成为广大群众的自觉的行为。麻陂乡修水利的农民，大辩论前，每天只有六百多人，大辩论之后，增加到二千四百多人，五天完成的土方等于过去二十五天的工作。
    据目前的统计，广东省搞起冬季生产大高潮的农业社约占社的总数50％；初步搞起生产高潮的农业社约占30％；只有占20％的农业社的生产搞得不好。在搞起生产大高潮的农业社中，有许多农业社，除了农业发展纲要宣传得好、辩论得好、群众思想发动得好外，最重要的成功原因是，领导工作紧紧跟上去了。今年冬季生产的特点是成千上万的农民食宿在水利工地上，人员比较集中。平日那种一般性的领导方法，已不能适应了。中共惠阳地委工作组在楼寨农业社宣传农业发展纲要就是在工地上，在群众作工休息时进行，效果很好。中共廉江、遂溪、信宜、海康等县的县委办公室，搬到重要水利工地上办公，带动八十多个乡党委，和许多社委会层层深入到工地、田间工作，效果很好。这种作法对解决生产任务繁重带来的许多具体的问题，如调整劳动组织、加强政治工作、组织各有关方面协作、器材供应、总结和推广先进经验，都起了极好的作用。至于领导同志到工地、田间后，政治上给予群众的良好影响，那就更不可估量了。
    最近，中共广东省委已经总结了上述经验。7日省委还发出指示说，中央和毛主席曾明确指示我们，要把农业发展纲要（修正草案）在全民中展开一次讨论，特别在农村要展开一次大辩论。广东省初步执行中央和毛主席这一指示的情况，证明这个指示完全正确。因此省委要求各地更坚决地执行中央和毛主席的指示，所有合作社都毫无例外地在最近半个月内，结合生产，就农业发展纲要举行一次大辩论，讨论次数在十次到十五次之间。务求通过这一辩论，进一步批判和克服右倾保守思想，挖掘潜力，制订或修改各农业社长远的和今年度的生产规划，以推动冬季生产运动进一步高涨。
