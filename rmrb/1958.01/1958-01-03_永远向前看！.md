    Always Look Forward!
    In this era of rapid change, people's thinking often lags behind reality. If people cannot keep their thinking closely aligned with the constantly developing reality, they will inevitably fall into the quagmire of new conservatism.
    After achieving certain successes in winter production in some parts of Jiangsu, they thought they were almost there, and their momentum for progress diminished. Why is this? Listen to what Xu Yongzheng, director of the He Ping Agricultural Cooperative in Suihe Township, said: "Since cooperativization, the entire cooperative has only produced 120,000 dan of fertilizer, but now we have accumulated 900,000 dan of fertilizer in just a few days. The achievement is significant." Although this sentence sounds ordinary, it reveals some of their actual thinking: they are comparing today's achievements with the past!
    Leading production is also revolution. The division between the promoters and obstructors of revolution is that the former always looks forward, while the latter always looks backward. It is hoped that in those areas that have achieved some success, they will set their sights on those areas that are progressing further and those people who are climbing higher, and always look forward! Always move forward!

    永远向前看！
    在这急剧变化的年代里，人的思想常常是落后于现实的。人们如果不能使自己的思想紧跟上不断发展的现实，必然要陷于新的保守主义的泥坑。
    江苏有些地方冬季生产作出一定成绩之后，他们就以为差不多了，前进的劲头就不大了。为什么这样？听听睢河乡和平农业社主任徐永正的说法吧：“合作化以来，全社只搞了十二万担肥料，现在不几天就积肥九十万担，成绩不小了。”这句话听起来虽平常，但却道出了一些他们的思想实际：原来他们是拿今天的成绩同过去比哩！
    领导生产同样是革命，革命的促进派和促退派的分野，就是前者永远向前看，而后者老是向后看。希望在那些有了一些成绩的地区，眼光要看到那些前进得更远的地区和攀登得更高的人们，永远向前看！永远向前进！
