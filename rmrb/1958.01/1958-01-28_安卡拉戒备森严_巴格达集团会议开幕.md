Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Ankara dispatch: The fourth meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council opened on January 27th in Ankara, the Turkish capital, in the heavily guarded Parliament Building.

The delegations from the five member states of this military treaty—Britain, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan—and the U.S. "observer" delegation all attended the opening meeting.

The meeting started somewhat later than scheduled. Because of an anti-American demonstration bomb explosion that occurred the night before the meeting opened, the atmosphere around the venue was tense. The Turkish security police force doubled in size, and plainclothes detectives even searched the briefcases of news reporters who came to cover the opening meeting. At the same time, the army and police conducted an emergency search throughout the city.

Turkish Prime Minister Menderes presided over the opening ceremony. After the bomb explosion, Menderes spent most of the evening in charge of directing the activities of the troops and police. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd both spoke at the opening session.

Prior to the Council meeting, the treaty's "Military," "Economic," and "Anti-Subversion" committees had already held separate meetings. The "Anti-Subversion Committee" issued a communique at the close of its meeting on the 25th, calling for a "vigorous expansion" of its activities.

    安卡拉戒备森严
    巴格达集团会议开幕
    新华社27日讯　安卡拉消息：巴格达条约理事会第四次会议27日在土耳其首都安卡拉戒备森严的议会大厦开幕。
    这个军事条约的五个成员国——英国、伊拉克、伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦——的代表团和美国的“观察员”代表团都参加了开幕会议。
    会议开始时间比预定的推迟了些。由于会议开幕前夜发生了反美示威炸弹爆炸事件，会场四周气氛紧张。土耳其保安警备力量加了一倍，便衣警探甚至在新闻记者前来报道开幕会议时，搜查了他们的公事皮包。同时，军队和警察在全市进行紧急搜查。
    土耳其总理曼德列斯主持了会议的开幕式。曼德列斯在炸弹爆炸之后，晚上大部分时间一直在负责指挥部队和警察的活动。美国国务卿杜勒斯、英国外交大臣劳埃德都在开幕会上讲了话。
    在理事会会议之前，这个条约的“军事”、“经济”和“反颠覆”委员会都已经分别举行了会议。“反颠覆委员会”在25日结束会议时发表公报，要求“大力扩大”它的活动。
