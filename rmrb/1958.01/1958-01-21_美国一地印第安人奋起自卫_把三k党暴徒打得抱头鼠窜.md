Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: American Indians in Robeson County, North Carolina, are resisting persecution by armed Ku Klux Klan members. After a conflict with Ku Klux Klan members on the 18th, they vigorously pursued Ku Klux Klan members on the 19th who were attempting to continue armed provocations.

With the connivance of local authorities, Ku Klux Klan members in Robeson County had recently prepared to carry out new persecutions against the Indians. This move by the racists aroused the indignation of all the Indians in Robeson County. On the evening of the 18th, hundreds of young and middle-aged men of the Indian tribe gathered at the meeting place of the Ku Klux Klan members, demanding that the meeting cease. However, because the Ku Klux Klan members refused this request, a conflict occurred between the two sides. The Indians fired thousands of shots into the sky and ground and prepared to arrest all the Ku Klux Klan members. At this time, the Ku Klux Klan members fled headlong, and only by using tear gas were these people able to avoid being captured by the Indians.

With the support of some upright white people, the Indians continued to search for the fleeing Ku Klux Klan members on the 19th and have already captured two of them. The Ku Klux Klan leader, Cole, now dares not show his face and has gone into hiding.

On the 19th, the Indians held a gathering, and many of those attending wore national costumes. They joyfully burned the crosses they had captured from the Ku Klux Klan members to celebrate their repulse of the racists' attack. At the meeting, the Indian leader announced that the Indians did not want to provoke racial conflict and did not want to kill white people, and that the incident was caused by the Ku Klux Klan members. If the Ku Klux Klan members continue to provoke, the 30,000 Indians in Robeson County will retaliate further.

    美国一地印第安人奋起自卫
    把三K党暴徒打得抱头鼠窜
    据新华社20日电　华盛顿消息：美国北卡罗来纳州罗伯逊县的印第安人反抗武装三K党徒的迫害。他们在18日同三K党徒发生冲突以后，又在19日大力追击企图继续进行武装挑衅的三K党徒。
    在地方当局的纵容下，罗伯逊县的三K党徒最近曾经准备对印第安人进行新的迫害。种族主义者这种举动激起了罗伯逊县全体印第安人的愤慨。数百名印第安族的青壮年在18日晚上聚集在三K党徒开会的地点，要求会议停止进行。但是由于三K党徒拒绝这个要求，双方发生冲突。印第安人向天空和地面放了数千发枪，并且准备把三K党徒全体逮捕。这时，三K党徒纷纷抱头鼠窜，这些人靠着摧泪弹才没有给印第安人捉住。
    印第安人在一些正直的白人的支持下，19日继续在搜寻逃遁的三K党人，并且已经抓住了两名。三K党的头子科尔现在已经不敢露面，隐藏了起来。
    印第安人19日举行了一个集会，参加集会的人许多都穿上民族服装。他们喜气洋洋地烧毁了他们从三K党徒那里虏获的十字架，来庆祝他们击退了种族主义者的进攻。印第安人的领袖在会上宣布说，印第安人并不想挑起种族冲突，也不想杀害白人，这次事件是三K党徒造成的。如果三K党人要继续进行挑衅，罗伯逊县的三万名印第安人还要进一步还击。
