Xinhua News Agency, January 11th, Fukuoka (Japan) message: According to the "Nishi Nippon Shimbun," Japanese scientists are conducting research into using chlorella to replace grain, and have achieved results in using it to feed animals. It is said that with further research, it may be used as food for humans during space flight.

Chlorella is a green, tiny, single-celled algae that reproduces in water. It propagates extremely widely and can be found everywhere in fish tanks, rivers, ponds, ditches, and moats.

The newspaper points out that chlorella contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, and eleven vitamins (particularly rich in vitamins A and C), much like a mixture of soybeans and spinach. Its fat content is twenty-five times that of rice. Therefore, people call chlorella "water pork."

In the past, it was said that chlorella was difficult to digest. However, recent animal experiments have shown that by heating and decolorizing it with wood alcohol, the digestion and absorption rate can be increased to 75%. Professor Kandatsu of Tokyo University, Professor Nakamura of Utsunomiya University, and others have used ordinary feed mixed with 10% chlorella to raise chickens. As a result, the chicken combs grew larger, the chicken legs became stronger, feather loss was reduced, resistance to disease was strengthened, and the egg production rate increased.

Chlorella has a strong photosynthetic capacity, reproduces quickly, and is not affected by climate. As long as natural conditions are good, its weight can increase a hundredfold in a single day.

However, whether chlorella can be directly used as human food remains a question. Dried chlorella has a taste similar to green laver powder, which is not suitable for human palates. The Japan Food Life Association is trying to incorporate chlorella into bread, candy, and other foods.

As early as World War I, the Germans wanted to use chlorella as food. It was not until after World War II that countries around the world began to conduct formal research. The Tokugawa Biological Research Institute in Japan began its research in this area in 1951. Now, they have built an outdoor chlorella cultivation pond with a total area equivalent to six Chinese mu (approximately one acre), with an annual output of up to ten tons.

### 小球藻代替粮食  日本科学家研究已有成效  “水中猪肉”营养丰富  繁殖极快一日长百倍

    小球藻代替粮食
    日本科学家研究已有成效
    “水中猪肉”营养丰富  繁殖极快一日长百倍
    据新华社11日讯　福岗（日本）消息：据“西日本新闻”报道，日本科学家正在进行以小球藻来代替粮食的研究，并且在试用它来饲养动物方面获得了成效。据说，经过进一步研究，可能将它用作宇宙飞行时人类的食粮。
    小球藻是在水中繁殖的绿色的微小的单细胞藻。它繁殖极广，在金鱼缸、河流、水塘、濠沟中到处可见。
    这家报纸指出，小球藻含有蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物、矿物质和十一种维生素（特别富于甲种和丙种维生素），很像是大豆和菠菜的混合物。它的脂肪含量等于大米的二十五倍。因此，人们称小球藻为“水中猪肉”。
    过去，人们曾说小球藻很难消化。但是，最近用动物实验结果证明，用木酒精使它加热褪色，可以把消化吸收的比率提高到75％。东京大学教授神立、宇都宫大学教授中村等人曾用掺有小球藻10％的普通饲料来养鸡。结果鸡冠长大，鸡足挺健，脱毛减少，对疾病抵抗力加强，产卵率增加。
    小球藻光合能力很强，繁殖快，不受气候影响。只要自然条件好，它的重量在一日之间可以增加到一百倍。
    但是小球藻能否原样不动地拿来作为人们的食物，这还是一个问题。晒干了的小球藻有一种绿紫菜粉末那样的味道，不适合人的口味。日本食生活协会正尝试将小球藻掺入面包、糖果等食品中。
    远在第一次世界大战期间，德国人就想要把小球藻作为食粮。直到第二次大战后，世界各国才开始正式进行研究。日本德川生物学研究所在这方面的研究是从1951年开始的。现在，他们已建成一个总面积相当于中国六市亩的小球藻野外培养池，年产量将达十吨。
