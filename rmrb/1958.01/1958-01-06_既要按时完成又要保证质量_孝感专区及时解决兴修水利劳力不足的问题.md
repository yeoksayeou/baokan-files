    How to deal with large-scale water conservancy projects, insufficient labor, the need to complete tasks on time, and ensure quality at the same time? Leading bodies in various parts of Xiaogan Special District, Hubei Province, are taking effective measures to solve this problem.
    There is a great enthusiasm for water conservancy construction in Xiaogan Special District, and the planned figures have been changing repeatedly. Originally, the district planned eighty-six large-scale irrigation projects, which has now increased to one hundred and nineteen; one hundred and fifty-two medium-sized irrigation projects have now soared to more than five hundred and twenty, more than double the original plan; in addition, there are more than five thousand small irrigation projects. Most of these projects have already started.
    Due to the huge scale of water conservancy projects and the heavy tasks, counties generally allocate half of their labor force to water conservancy. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage, counties in Xiaogan Special District have conscientiously strengthened labor management. Xiaogan, Hanyang, Dawu, Yingcheng and other counties implement project sequencing and contract quotas, that is, according to the size of the project, they are contracted to districts, townships, and cooperatives, which are responsible to the end. XinJian Agricultural Cooperative in Dawu County organized four groups for digging, carrying soil, blasting stones and miscellaneous work, according to the physical strengths of the people participating in water conservancy construction. Then, the thirty-three ponds built by the whole cooperative were contracted to teams and groups, which was very popular among the masses. Anlu and other places also held and organized construction site canteens and nursery groups, which solved the difficulty of women's attendance and improved labor efficiency.
    Various places widely mobilized the masses to contribute ideas, improve tools, and improve work efficiency. Some counties have adopted tools such as "steel wire pulley," "double earth-ramming frame," and "derrick earth-ramming hammer" to accelerate the progress of the project. The migrant workers participating in the Xiaojiawan water conservancy project in Yingcheng County created more than 20 kinds of tools and advanced operating methods. When they encountered rainy days, the earth-ramming hammer was easy to stick to the soil, so they wrapped the hammer with straw and named it "ramming hammer wearing straw shoes"; it was inconvenient to ram the earth at night, so they created the "Imperata cylindrica ramming method," which allowed them to ram the earth without lighting; in addition, there were "high-altitude soil transportation" and "animal-powered soil lifting," etc. These creations played a great role in overcoming the difficulty of soil extraction and improving work efficiency. Judging from the current situation, the construction period of Xiaojiawan can be shortened by at least half the time. In addition, the counties also accepted the suggestions of the masses and widely adopted animal power to extract and transport soil, using existing dog carts and chicken carts to push soil, which generally increased work efficiency by 20% to 50%.
    At present, the number of people participating in water conservancy construction in the district every day has reached about 1.3 million, and the project is progressing rapidly. In order to keep the technology up to date and prevent practices that disregard quality, the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a notice, instructing counties to quickly take measures to continue training a group of technical cadres, and also calling on all localities to conscientiously rely on the masses, submit the construction plan of each project to the masses for discussion, give play to the wisdom of the masses, overcome all difficulties, and make the district's water conservancy projects fast, good and economical.

### 既要按时完成又要保证质量  孝感专区及时解决兴修水利劳力不足的问题

    既要按时完成又要保证质量
    孝感专区及时解决兴修水利劳力不足的问题
    据新华社武汉电　水利规模大，劳动力不足，任务必须按时完成，同时又要保证质量，怎么办？湖北省孝感专区各地领导机关正采取有效办法解决这个问题。
    孝感专区兴修水利的劲头很大，规划数字一再变动。原来全区规划大型灌溉工程八十六处，现在增加到一百一十九处；中型灌溉工程一百五十二处，现在激增到五百二十多处，超过原来规划的二倍多；另外还有小型灌溉工程五千多处。这些工程大部已经动工。
    由于水利规模巨大，任务繁重，各县一般都拿出一半的劳动力放在水利上，为了解决劳动力紧张的问题，孝感专区各县都认真地加强了劳动管理。孝感、汉阳、大悟、应城等县实行工程排队、包工定额，即按工程大小，分别包给区、乡、社，负责到底。大悟县新建农业社根据参加兴修水利的各人的体力特长，组织挖土、挑土、炸石头和杂工等四组，然后把全社兴修的三十三个塘，分别包工到队和组，很受群众欢迎。安陆等地还举办和组织了工地食堂和托儿组，解决了妇女出勤的困难，提高了劳动效率。
    各地广泛地发动群众献计，改进工具，提高工效。有些县已采取“钢丝滑车”、“双硪打土架”、“吊杆打土硪”等工具，加速了工程进度。参加应城县肖家畈水利工程的民工们，创造的工具和先进操作方法达二十多种。他们碰到雨天，打硪容易粘土，就用稻草把硪包住，取名“硪穿草鞋”；夜里打硪不便，他们就创造了“茅腰子打硪法”，不用照明照样打硪；另外，还有“高空运土”、“畜力起土”等。这些创造对克服取土困难、提高工效起了很大作用。从现在的情况看，肖家畈工期至少可以缩短一半时间。此外，各县还接受了群众的建议，广泛地采用了畜力取土、运土，利用现有的狗头车、鸡公车推土，一般提高工效20％到50％。
    目前，全区每天参加兴修水利的人数达一百三十万左右，工程进展很快。为了使技术跟上去，防止不顾质量的作法，中共孝感地委会最近发出通知，除指示各县迅速采取措施继续训练一批技术干部外，还号召各地认真地依靠群众，把每一项工程的施工计划交群众讨论，发挥群众智慧，克服一切困难，使全区水利工程搞得又快又好又省。
