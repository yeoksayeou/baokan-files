    A Beautiful Lyric Poem
    ——After Reading "Late Night on the Railway Construction Site"
            Chen Xiaoyu
    I was very happy to finish Comrade Du Pengcheng's beautiful lyric poem – "Late Night on the Railway Construction Site" (published in the January 11th People's Daily supplement).

    The heart of driver Zhao Yuqin, the heart of the chief commander, and the heart of me, the reader, are all connected. Listening closely: it seems that three hearts are beating on one string – the string of socialist construction.

    Late at night – 2:05 AM, an important meeting at the construction site adjourned. Driver Lao Zhao was to take the chief commander into the city.

    The whole piece has very few lines of dialogue, but the author subtly and closely leads you into a sublime, poetic spiritual realm: the relationship between Lao Zhao and the chief commander is the crystallization of revolutionary friendship, the condensation of class feelings.

    Lao Zhao is so familiar with the chief commander – familiar with his living habits, familiar with his thoughts and feelings, familiar with his selfless dedication to work... Therefore, he tries his best to reduce and share the chief commander's fatigue. He prepares boiled water, sweet potatoes, biscuits, and beef for the chief commander; he speeds up to bypass construction site number 51, aiming to give the chief commander a chance to rest, even if it's for a very short time... Lao Zhao knows that once the chief commander gets into the city, he will immediately immerse himself in work again, so there will be no possibility of sleep? And the chief commander's sleep is often in the car, so he deliberately slows down the car, and later simply stops.

    "Lao Zhao rubs his eyes hard and sees the chief commander leaning his head against the iron support of the car door, sleeping soundly. His right arm is hanging outside the car, and his sleeve is rolled up… This arm is thick and strong. If you put your ear to it, you will surely hear the sound of blood rushing and surging in the blood vessels. Also, those three scars on the arm, placed side by side, are so clear in the moonlight.”

    Ah! The scars on the chief commander's arm are glorious battle records;
    The chief commander's expression is as innocent as a child;
    The chief commander's sound sleep is a sweet moment after intense fighting.

    Through the spoken and unspoken language between the chief commander and Lao Zhao, through the journey of Lao Zhao's jeep, you will feel the entire construction site is busy and tense. Including the moonlight, the late-night wind, the whistle, and everything else, are all busy and tense. Although it is so, it is not chaotic: trucks and horse-drawn carts are constantly flowing, small birds are chirping, and the river water underfoot is flowing quietly. The chief commander is a brilliant band conductor, and the symphony of labor is playing day and night.

    优美的抒情诗
    ——读“铁路工地上的深夜”后记
            陈笑雨
    我很高兴地读完了杜鹏程同志一篇优美的抒情诗——“铁路工地上的深夜”（载1月11日人民日报副刊）。
    司机赵玉勤同志的心，总指挥同志的心，和我这个读者的心，心心相连。侧耳细听：仿佛三颗心在一根弦上——社会主义建设的弦上砰砰拍动。
    深夜——两点零五分，工地上一个重要会议散会了。司机老赵要把总指挥送进城里去。
    全篇很少几句对话，但作者丝丝入扣地把你带进了一个崇高的、诗化了的精神境界：老赵和总指挥的关系，是革命友爱的结晶，是阶级感情的凝炼。
    老赵是那么熟悉总指挥——熟悉他的生活习惯，熟悉他的思想感情，熟悉他的沉浸在工作中的忘我的战斗。……因此，他想尽一切办法减少和分担总指挥的疲劳。他为总指挥准备好开水、地瓜、饼子和牛肉；他就加快车速，躲过五十一号工点，目的是，争取让总指挥有个那怕是极短时间的休息机会；……老赵知道：一进城总指挥一定马上又泡在工作里，那有睡眠的可能？而总指挥的睡眠往往是在汽车上的，他故意把车速放慢，后来干脆停下来了。
    “老赵狠狠地揉揉眼，看见总指挥头靠在车门的铁撑子上，睡得挺香。右胳膊在车外边吊着，而且袖子拥上去了。……这条胳膊又粗又壮，你试试把耳朵贴在上边，准能听到血液在血管里奔流激荡的响声。还有，那胳膊上并排摆着的三个伤疤，在月光下看得多么清楚。”
    呵！总指挥胳膊上的伤疤，是光荣的战斗纪录；
    总指挥这神态是孩子般的天真；
    总指挥的酣睡是紧张战斗之余的甜蜜的一瞬。
    通过总指挥和老赵之间的有声的和无声的语言，通过老赵吉普车前进的一段旅程，你会感到整个工地的繁忙、紧张。连同那月色、那深夜的风、那哨子声、那一切的一切，都在繁忙、紧张。虽然如此，并不紊乱：卡车、马车在川流不息的走，小鸟在?噜噜的飞，脚下的江水在静静的流。总指挥是高明的乐队指挥，劳动的交响曲在日夜演奏。
                                  1958年1月13日夜
