　　Zhang Shuanzhu, the director of the Women's Federation in Dawangnou Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, is an expert in managing her household thriftily. Her family has a total of eleven members, three older children attending elementary school, four younger children at home, and her mother-in-law and mother handling household chores separately. She and her husband, Sun Baozhi, participate in agricultural production.

　　Last year, she saved over 500 jin of grain by eating more vegetables and less grain. She planted vegetables in her 0.7-mu private plot and some available open spaces, harvesting over 8,000 jin of cabbage, 1,000 jin of radish, and over 1,000 jin of kohlrabi.

　　Zhang Shuanzhu is also good at educating her children about managing the household thriftily. Her two older children, Jilin and Ruilin, have collected over 1,300 jin of manure fertilizer since the beginning of winter, using their time in the mornings and evenings. She also pays attention to saving in clothing. She altered larger old clothes to fit smaller children, and made old clothes new again. Last year, she only bought 1.2 zhang of cloth, which was enough to keep the whole family warm and clean.

    她会打算
    河北省定县大王耨村的妇联主任张拴竹，是个勤俭持家的能手。她全家共十一口人，三个大孩子在小学念书，四个小孩子都在家里，婆母和母亲分头料理家务，她和丈夫孙保志参加农业生产。
  　去年，她采取多吃菜少吃粮的办法，节省了五百多斤粮食。她在七分自留地里和一些能利用的空地上种了菜，光白菜就收了八千多斤，萝卜一千斤，根苔菜一千多斤。
    张拴竹也善于对孩子进行勤俭持家的教育。她的两个大孩子吉林和瑞林，入冬以来利用早晚的时间拣了一千三百多斤粪肥。在穿衣方面，她也注意节约。她把过去的衣服大改小，旧改新，去年只买了一丈二尺布，就让全家都穿得暖暖和和，干干净净的。

    张拴竹把节约下来的三块钱买了建设公债。这是她把公债券拿给她的丈夫孙保志看。
