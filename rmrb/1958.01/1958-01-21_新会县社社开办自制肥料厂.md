    Xinhui County Communes Establish Self-Made Fertilizer Plants
    (Our dispatch) Five hundred and fifty out of five hundred and fifty-five agricultural production cooperatives in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, have already established self-made fertilizer plants. From November of last year to early January of this year, they have produced a total of more than 900,000 dan of various artificial fertilizers, including more than 230,000 dan of granular fertilizer, which can solve the fertilizer needs of 260,000 mu of paddy fields.
    The experience of agricultural cooperatives establishing self-made fertilizer plants was first created by the Longbang No. 1 Cooperative in Xinhui County. Over the past few years, Longbang No. 1 Cooperative has provided a good example in solving fertilizer problems. In addition to launching a mass and regular fertilizer accumulation campaign to ensure that everyone contributes ideas and every household accumulates fertilizer, they also established a self-made fertilizer plant. Using 200 yuan to build a mud-walled, thatched-roofed factory building and purchase fertilizer-making tools, they used soil and miscellaneous fertilizers containing various different fertilizer elements, based on soil properties and the needs of various crops, to make mixed fertilizers, granular fertilizers, and other fertilizers with high fertilizer efficiency and small volume, with very good results. This cooperative has basically achieved self-sufficiency in fertilizer.
    The Xinhui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began to promote the experience of Longbang No. 1 Cooperative in the first half of last year, but the work was intermittent. Starting in November of last year, it vigorously carried out this work again, and to date, it has organized more than 7,000 cadres from various districts, townships, and cooperatives to visit and learn from Longbang No. 1 Cooperative. Recently, the County Committee has decided to further concentrate the fertilizer plant directors of more than 500 agricultural cooperatives in Longbang No. 1 Cooperative in batches to learn the advanced working methods of this agricultural cooperative's fertilizer plant on the spot.
    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee also issued a decision on December 27th of last year to learn from the experience of Longbang No. 1 Cooperative. At present, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of the Foshan Special District have organized delegations to visit and learn from Longbang No. 1 Cooperative.

### 新会县社社开办自制肥料厂

    新会县社社开办自制肥料厂
    本报讯　广东省新会县五百五十五个农业生产合作社，已有五百五十个社开办了自制肥料厂。从去年11月到今年1月上旬，共制成各种人造肥料九十多万担，其中颗粒肥料二十三万多担，可以解决二十六万亩稻田施肥的需要。
    农业社开办自制肥料厂的经验，是新会县龙榜一社首先创造的。几年来，龙榜一社在解决肥料问题方面，提供了一个好榜样。他们除了发动群众性经常性的积肥运动，做到人人献策、户户积肥以外，还开办了自制肥料厂，用二百元建筑一间泥墙草盖的厂房和购买制肥工具，根据土质性能和各种农作物的需要，把含有各种不同肥素的土杂肥，制成肥效高、体积小的混合肥、颗粒肥等肥料，效果很好。这个社已经基本上达到肥料自给。
    中共新会县县委会在去年上半年就开始推广龙榜一社的经验，但是工作时断时续。从去年11月开始，又大力进行这一工作，到现在为止，已先后组织各个区、乡、社干部七千多人前往龙榜一社参观学习。最近，县委已决定进一步把五百多个农业社的制肥厂厂长，分批集中到龙榜一社，实地学习这个农业社制肥厂先进的工作方法。
    中共广东省委和省人民委员会在去年12月27日也发布了学习龙榜一社经验的决定。目前，佛山专区各地农业社，已纷纷组织代表团前往龙榜一社参观、学习。
