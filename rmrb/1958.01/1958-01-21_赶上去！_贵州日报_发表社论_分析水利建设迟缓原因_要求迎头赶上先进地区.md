Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 19th. Following the People's Daily's dispatch on the 15th, which announced the national situation of farmland water conservancy and soil and water conservation plans, pointing out that Guizhou Province is one of the provinces with slow progress and insufficient drive, the Guizhou Daily published an editorial on the 18th entitled "Catch Up," analyzing the reasons for the slow progress and demanding that the people of the province summon revolutionary vigor and strive to catch up with advanced regions.

The editorial said that according to statistics from January 8th, the province only increased the irrigated area by 675,164 mu, accounting for 16.7% of the annual target. Compared with the same period in previous years, the scale and speed of water conservancy construction this year are unprecedented; however, looking at others and thinking about ourselves, we are undoubtedly lagging behind.

The editorial said that according to recent understanding, in many areas where water conservancy construction is progressing slowly, some have adopted "take it slow" as their guiding ideology from the beginning, saying "there is no need to rush, the task will be completed sooner or later," and "according to last year's experience, a sprint after the Spring Festival will do." This is a kind of conservative, lethargic, and lacking revolutionary vigor thinking. People with this kind of thinking always treat the old calendar as new, neither studying whether their production plan is advanced or conservative, nor looking at the fact that others are leaping forward in the execution of their plans, and always finding various "reasons" to excuse their backwardness. The editorial emphasized that certain counties in the Southeast Guizhou and South Guizhou regions, such as Huishui, are particularly slow in water conservancy construction and must catch up quickly.

The editorial proposed: Perhaps some people suspect that others have exceeded their annual target by three times or one and a half times in the same amount of time as us, is it because the specific circumstances are different? The editorial immediately replied that the circumstances are different, but the facts of the past few years have shown that in the process of marching towards nature, although there are differences in natural conditions in various places, the most important issue is people, is people's thinking and attitude; for things with the same objective factors, due to different viewpoints and different attitudes, promoters and inhibitors will draw completely opposite conclusions. Hebei Province has a population of more than 32 million, and the increased irrigated area is more than 17 million mu, averaging 1.88 people per mu of water conservancy area; Henan Province has a population of more than 40 million, and the increased irrigated area is more than 15 million mu, averaging 2.66 people per mu of water conservancy area; our province has a population of approximately 16 million, and the increased irrigated area is more than 675,000 mu, averaging 23.8 people per mu of water conservancy area. Doesn't this fully illustrate that whether the task of building farmland water conservancy can be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, the results of executing the plan in the same period are good or bad, and the division between advanced and backward is so obvious, isn't it a concrete reflection of the existence of two opposing ideas, positive and negative, in people's minds?

The editorial concluded: The current task is that we sincerely and humbly accept the criticism from the People's Daily, earnestly improve our shortcomings and mistakes, make up our minds, make vows, catch up quickly, summon strong revolutionary vigor, and strive to catch up with advanced regions. As long as all cadres and the broad masses correctly treat these issues with a revolutionary attitude, we believe that the upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction in the province will rapidly increase, and great achievements are just around the corner.

### 赶上去！  “贵州日报”发表社论  分析水利建设迟缓原因  要求迎头赶上先进地区

    赶上去！
    “贵州日报”发表社论
    分析水利建设迟缓原因
    要求迎头赶上先进地区
    新华社贵阳19日电新华社15日播发人民日报于当天公布的全国各地农田水利及水土保持计划执行情况的消息中，指出贵州省是进度迟缓和劲头不足的省份之一以后，贵州日报在18日以“赶上去”为题发表社论，分析了进度迟缓的原因，要求全省人民鼓起革命干劲，力争迎头赶上先进地区。
    社论说，据1月8日的统计，全省只增加扩灌面积六十七万五千一百六十四亩，占全年任务数的16.7％。如果和以前几年同期比较，今年水利建设的规模和速度都是空前的；但是，看看人家，想想自己，无疑是落后了。
    社论说，据不久前的了解，在许多水利建设进展迟缓的地区，有的一开始就以“慢慢来”作为指导思想，说什么“不必着急，任务迟早都会完成”，“根据去年的经验，到春节后来一个突击就行了。”这是一种墨守成规，暮气沉沉，缺乏革命朝气的思想。有这种思想的人总是把老皇历当成新的看，既不研究自己的生产计划是先进还是保守，更不看人家在执行计划中快步跃进的事实，总是找出种种“理由”为自己的落后解嘲。社论着重指出黔东南、黔南地区某些县，如惠水，水利建设特别迟缓，必须急起直追。
    社论提出：也许有人怀疑，人家在和我们同样的时间里，兴修水利的任务超过了全年计划数的三倍或一倍半，是不是具体情况不同呢？社论随即回答说，情况是有不同的，但是几年来的事实表明，在向自然进军的过程中，各地自然条件虽有差异，而最重要的问题是人，是人的思想和态度；对各种客观因素相同的事物，由于观点不同，态度不同，在促进派和促退派看来，就会得出完全相反的结论。河北省人口三千二百多万，已增加的扩灌面积为一千七百多万亩，平均一点八八人兴修水利面积一亩；河南省人口四千多万，已增加的扩灌面积为一千五百多万亩，平均二点六六人兴修水利面积一亩；本省人口约一千六百万，已增加扩灌面积六十七万五千多亩，平均二十三点八人才兴修水利面积一亩。这难道不能充分说明：兴修农田水利任务能不能提早超额完成，在同一时期内执行计划的结果有好有坏，先进和落后的分野是这样的明显，不正是在人们的思想上存在着积极和消极两种对立思想的具体反映么？
    社论最后说：当前的任务是，我们诚恳而又虚心地接受人民日报的批评，认真地改进自己的缺点和错误，下定决心，立下志愿，急起直追，鼓起坚强的革命干劲，力争迎头赶上先进地区。只要全体干部和广大群众以革命的态度正确对待这些问题，我们相信，全省兴修农田水利的高潮必将迅速增高，而巨大的成就也是指日可待的。
