    A Toast to the Longevity of an Extraordinary Elder!
    Tián Hàn
    After congratulating Mr. Xiāo Chánghuá on his 70th anniversary of stage life, listening to Mr. Xiāo’s speech, and watching the commemorative performance by Mr. Méi and others, I feel there are still some things I want to say.
    Mr. Xiāo is just a very ordinary elder. He was born into a theatrical family. He started learning opera at the age of eleven, and made his stage debut the following year. Later, he was promoted by Wáng Lěngxiān and performed with Yú Yùqín and Tán Xīnpéi. In 1904, at the age of twenty-seven, he was hired to join the teaching staff of the Xǐliánchéng Opera School. After the Xīnhài Revolution, Xǐliánchéng was renamed Fùliánchéng, and he persisted there for thirty-six years until he left in 1940. From 1922 until the Japanese invasion in 1937, Mr. Xiāo collaborated with Mr. Méi Lánfāng for fifteen whole years. After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, he continued to cooperate with Mr. Méi until today. This, generally speaking, is a rather ordinary experience. Moreover, Mr. Xiāo plays the "small painted face" role, portraying ordinary, even villainous, characters. In his daily interactions with people, he is so modest and cautious. He lives a frugal life, loves to work, and always walks to and from work, never liking to take a car, consistently for decades. All of this seems to give a common impression.
    But, on the other hand, I feel that Mr. Xiāo is truly extraordinary.
    In an era when opera art was not valued, Mr. Xiāo loved it so much. Through diligent practice in both summer and winter, he never allowed himself to slacken for a single day. He treated each performance with such seriousness and earnestness, meticulously creating characters from the perspectives of character and story logic, cooperating seamlessly with others, neither lukewarm nor overzealous, never arbitrarily making jokes to ruin the plot and pander to the audience. He was never self-satisfied or selfish, always enthusiastically and patiently passing on his skills to his students. He is a versatile teacher of all types of roles, including male, female, painted face, and clown roles. Many important figures from the "Xǐ," "Lián," "Shèng," and "Shì" periods of contemporary Peking Opera actors were personally cultivated by Mr. Xiāo. After the national liberation in 1950, Mr. Xiāo served as a professor in the Peking Opera Department of the China Opera Experimental School, and was later appointed as the vice principal of the China Opera Experimental School. He progressed from fighting alone in the past to conducting opera teaching with the strong support and guidance of the Party and the government, further displaying his experience and talent. In reality, Mr. Xiāo is not only a very comprehensive Peking Opera teacher but also an excellent organizer of opera teaching, so much so that some estimate that nearly a thousand actors have come from his tutelage in the past forty years. It can truly be said that "peach and plum trees are all over the world" for him. Can this be considered a common thing?
    The extraordinary nature of his career is not only measured by the number and quality of the talents he has cultivated. His greatness lies in accepting and developing the excellent traditions of Chinese opera art and effectively passing these excellent traditions on to a generation of talented successors. In the words of Mr. Xiāo and others, it is to make this excellent artistic spark "pass on forever."
    Chinese opera art is increasingly valued by theater artists from various countries. People say that the unique dramatic expression form created by the Chinese people is sufficient to save Western theater from its plight. Therefore, Mr. Xiāo's long-term ordinary work as a propagator of tradition has increased its extraordinary and glorious significance.
    Chinese opera, from its nascent stage of development, has had a sharp, critical, and realistic tradition. The art of the clown is often a magnifying glass for unjust phenomena and backward realities. Chinese clown actors, in order to fight against these ugly things through art, often disregard their personal safety and even their lives.
    After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Lǐ Hóngzhāng ceded Taiwan to Japan. The famous clown Liú Gǎnsān, in his eighties, went on stage to perform, sharply and powerfully satirizing Lǐ Hóngzhāng's corruption, incompetence, and betrayal of national sovereignty. He was hit with a teacup by Lǐ Hóngzhāng's son, who was in the audience, and even thrown into prison. Liú Gǎnsān died not long after being released from prison. This is something many people still remember.
    Mr. Xiāo has also largely inherited this tradition.
    After the fall of Beijing in 1937, traitors colluded with the Japanese invaders, engaging in speculation and exploitation of the suffering people. At that time, Mr. Xiāo joined Zhāng Jūnqiū's Qiānhé Society. During the performance of "The Chaste Martyr," Mr. Xiāo used the character's voice to denounce the traitors and running dogs who were selling out the country for personal glory, almost leading to disaster.
    After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Kuomintang once again rode roughshod over the people. At this time, Mr. Xiāo joined the Méi Troupe. During the performance of "Farewell My Concubine," he used the watchman's voice to subject the Kuomintang reactionaries to cold ridicule and abuse.
    In May of this year, right-wing elements such as Lǐ Wànchūn and Yè Shènglán, under the instructions of Zhāng Bójūn and others, insisted on trying to get Mr. Xiāo and others to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, believing that as long as Mr. Xiāo and others joined, a gap would be opened in the entire opera community. Who knew that as soon as they made this request, they were met with a stern rejection from Mr. Xiāo, who said that if he were to join any party, it would be the Communist Party. During the joint struggle against right-wing elements in the opera community, Mr. Xiāo vehemently condemned these people for trying to drag him, an eighty-year-old man, into the fire pit. He spoke with tears in his eyes, giving the entire opera community great inspiration and making the distinction between right and wrong even clearer.
    It should be said that Mr. Xiāo has been tested in the national democratic revolutionary struggle. It is rare that he has maintained such a firm position in the socialist revolution. Some of our veteran Party members in the literary and art circles have also failed all three tests, while the eighty-year-old Mr. Xiāo has passed all three tests. Can this be considered too common?
    We have reason to commemorate the eightieth birthday of this extraordinary artist and drama educator. We support the certificate of merit given to Mr. Xiāo by the Ministry of Culture. We ask the theater community to learn from Mr. Xiāo's exquisite artistic achievements, especially his noble moral character as a working person.
    I wrote a poem on the day I congratulated him on his birthday and have attached it here because Mr. Xiāo said: "Ah, my whole life is here!"
    “Through arduous cultivation in summer and winter, a veteran soldier in the hundred-year pear garden:
    Stealing documents and contesting suspicions, truly Jiǎng Gàn, reviewing heads and saying live Tāng Qín;
    Artistic talent is already as mellow as wine, and today peach and plum trees are as dense as clouds,
    It is rare to celebrate in the new society, putting in effort again to benefit the people."

### 祝一位不平凡的老人长寿！

    祝一位不平凡的老人长寿！
    田汉
    在祝贺了萧长华老先生舞台生活七十年纪念，听了萧先生的讲话，看了梅先生们的纪念演出之后，觉得还有一些话想说。
    萧先生只是一位极平凡的老人。他出身于戏剧世家，十一岁上学戏，第二年就登台演唱，后来受王楞仙的提拔，与余玉琴、谭鑫培合演。1904年他二十七岁起，又被聘参加喜连成科班的教学工作，辛亥革命后喜连成改为富连成，到1940年脱退为止，他一直坚持了三十六年。从1922年起到1937年日寇入侵为止，萧先生与梅兰芳先生整整合作了十五年，及至1949年北京解放又跟梅先生继续合作，直到今天。这说起来也还是一个较为平凡的经历。再加萧先生演的是小花脸，扮的是平凡的、甚至是反派的人物；他平日待人接物又是那样的谦和谨慎；自奉是那样的俭朴，爱劳动，出外办事，上下园子，老是步行，不爱坐车，几十年如一日；这些似乎都给人一个平凡的印象。
    但反过来一想，又觉萧先生真是太不平凡了。
    在戏曲艺术还那样十分不被重视的时代，萧先生就是那样地热爱它，三冬两夏，勤修苦练，不肯一天懈怠；对待每次的演出他是那样的严肃认真，从人物性格和故事情理上精心创造，跟别人配搭丝丝入扣，不瘟不火，不任意抓哏，破坏剧情，取媚观众。他又从不自足自私，总是热心耐性地把自己的本事传给学生，他是生旦净丑各行的教学全材，当代京剧名演员包含“喜”“连”“盛”“世”各期的重要人物多是萧先生亲自培养出来的。1950年全国解放之后，萧先生任中国戏曲实验学校京剧系教授，其后又被任命为中国戏曲实验学校副校长，他由过去的孤军奋斗，进一步在党和政府大力支持指导下进行戏曲教学，更能展布他的经验和才能。实在的，萧先生不只是一位很全面的京剧教师，也是很好的戏曲教学组织者，以致有人估计，四十几年来从他手下出来的演员，将近千人。他真可说是“桃李满天下”了，这能说是很平凡的事吗？
    他的事业之不平凡还不只是就他培养的人材的数和质量说的，他的伟大在于接受和发展了中国戏曲艺术的优秀传统，而且把这一优秀传统有效地交给了一些有才能的后一代。用萧先生们的话说是使这一优秀的艺术火种“流传永载”。
    中国戏曲艺术越来越被各国戏剧艺术家们重视了。人们说中国人民创造的独特的戏剧表现形式，足以挽救西方戏剧的厄运。因而作为传统传播者的萧先生的长期的平凡的工作就增加其不平凡的、光辉的意义了。
    中国戏曲从它的发展的萌芽状态就有着尖锐的批判的现实主义传统。丑角艺术常常是对不公正的现象、落后现实的放大镜，中国丑角演员为着通过艺术对这些丑恶事物做斗争常常不顾惜他的个人安全甚至生命。
    甲午中日战争之后，李鸿章把台湾割给日本，名丑刘赶三，八十多岁了，登台演戏，冷隽有力地讥刺李鸿章的腐朽无能，丧权辱国。被在座的李鸿章的儿子用茶杯打他，还抓他入狱，刘赶三在出狱后不久就死了。这是许多人都还记得的事。
    萧老先生也大体继承了这个传统。
    1937年北京沦陷后，汉奸们投靠日寇，投机倒把，剥削痛苦人民。那时候萧先生参加了张君秋的谦和社，在演出“奇烈女”的时候，萧先生借人物的嘴里痛骂当时卖国求荣的汉奸走狗，几乎因此得祸。
    1945年日本投降之后，国民党又骑在人民头上作威作福，萧先生这时参加梅剧团，在演出“霸王别姬”的时候，他从更夫的嘴里又对国民党反动派加以冷嘲热骂。
    今年5月间，李万春、叶盛长等右派分子奉章伯钧们的指使一定要争取萧先生们加入农工民主党，以为只要萧先生们加入了，整个戏曲界就打开缺口了。谁知他们一提出这个要求，就遭到了萧先生的严词拒绝，说他要入就入共产党。在戏曲界联合斗争右派分子的时候，萧先生痛斥这些人想把他这八十岁的老人也拖入火坑，他谈得声泪俱下，给了全体戏曲界极大感动，使大是大非更加明白。
    应该说萧先生在民族民主革命斗争中是通过考验了。难得是在社会主义革命中也立场站得这样坚决。我们文艺界某些多年的老党员也大有在三次考验中都不及格的，而八十高龄的萧老先生却在三次考验中都及了格，这也能说是太平凡的事吗？
    我们有理由纪念这位不平凡的老艺术家和戏剧教育家的八十诞辰。我们拥护中央文化部给萧先生的奖状。我们要求戏剧界向萧先生的精湛的艺术造诣特别是他的高贵的劳动人民的道德品质学习。
    我在跟他祝寿的那天写了一首诗也附在这里，因为萧先生说：“我呀，我的事都在这里了！”
    “三冬两夏苦耕耘，百载梨园一老军：
    盗柬争疑真蒋干，审头都说活汤勤；
    艺能已是醇如酒，桃李于今密似云，
    难得称觞新社会，再抛心力福人群。”
