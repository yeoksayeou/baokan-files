Official Bureaucracy Begins to Dissipate; Vigor is Being Promoted
A Great Transformation in the Leadership Style of Central State Organs after General Rectification

    (Our report) A new atmosphere has emerged in many units of the central state organs as the leadership style has improved. This is one of the new phenomena that has appeared after the general rectification phase of the rectification movement.

  Deeply Investigating Situations at Lower Levels
    Personally Rewriting Official Documents
    A prominent sign of the improvement in leadership style is that many leading cadres are personally involved in their work, changing the past practice of not being in touch with reality and relying too much on subordinates. In the past, when the Ministry of Foreign Trade held large-scale meetings, the ministry's leading cadres generally did not participate in the preparation work. Recently, the ministry is about to convene a meeting on export work to capitalist countries. During the preparation for the meeting, Vice Minister Li Zheren personally went to the nine affiliated companies to understand the situation and study the problems; he spent half a day each time and has continued for nine days. This has provided a reliable guarantee for improving the quality of the meeting. Before the rectification movement, in the Ministry of Coal Industry, except for a few important documents, a large number of official documents were handled by secretaries, and the “signature stamps” of directors and deputy directors of bureaus and departments were handed over to the secretaries. Therefore, the directors and deputy directors of bureaus and departments could not know the problems reflected in many documents at all. After the rectification, the “signature stamps” were cancelled, and all directors and deputy directors of bureaus and departments personally drafted and approved official documents. Yan Zhisan, Deputy Director of the Local Industry Bureau, has drafted more important documents such as "How to Give Play to the Enthusiasm of Local Coal Industry" and "1958 Local Industry Work Arrangement" after the rectification. He also put forward detailed opinions on the handling of official documents, so that lower-level cadres can follow when handling official documents. In the past, various summaries and reports of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry were drafted by cadres responsible for specific work, and leading cadres rarely did it themselves, so the quality was not high. Now, after Deputy Director Wang Tieyun gathered everyone to study the situation, he has summarized the experience and lessons of the ministry's basic construction plan in the past five years. All parties are relatively satisfied with this summary. In the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, many directors, bureau chiefs, institute directors, and institute heads have begun to break away from the shackles of offices and conference tables and directly go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and solve problems. The director of the Design Bureau has also stipulated a regular system of going to various design institutes in Beijing at least once every two weeks. Wu Boxiao, Deputy Director of the People's Education Publishing House affiliated to the Ministry of Education, now goes to the editorial offices he leads regularly every week for half a day to work and study and solve problems on the spot, changing the shortcomings of not being thorough in his work and not being able to solve problems in time in the past.
    After the rectification, senior engineering and technical personnel who are in charge of leadership responsibilities also have a great improvement in their leadership style. For example, Yang Changquan, Cao Rongjiang, Wang Jintang and other engineers from the Nonferrous Metals Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, personally went to the laboratory not long ago to solve the germanium explosion problem, so that the actual recovery rate of germanium chlorination distillation increased from 30% to 40% to 90%.

  Leaders Personally Receive Visitors
    The Phenomenon of Procrastination Has Been Greatly Reduced
    Another manifestation of the improvement of leadership style is that the phenomenon of procrastination in handling affairs has been greatly reduced. The following two things can best illustrate this change. Recently, someone from Baotou came to the Ministry of Coal Industry to talk about coal prices. In the past, such problems were received by ordinary cadres, so the problems were often not solved quickly and were not solved well enough, resulting in delays. This time, Liu Kexian, Deputy Director of the Sales Bureau, personally came forward to receive the interview, so that the problem was solved at that time. Cadres from the No. 401 Factory affiliated to the Nonferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry who came to Beijing on business said that they spent a full seven days to go to the ministry and bureau to handle three matters last year, while this time it only took six hours to handle the same three matters. He said that the directors and section chiefs were also very kind when receiving them, but in the past, he felt that he had entered a large agency, "not knowing whether to stand or sit." In some units of the central state organs, the official style of procrastination, perfunctoriness, showing off, and rude attitude is being cleaned up, and what is replacing it is the vigorous revolutionary vigor and humble style.

    Regularly Participate in Social Activities and Mingling with the Masses
    In addition to the above-mentioned improvements in work style, the leading cadres of many units of the central state organs are also closer to the masses in their daily life style and mingle with the masses. As early as August last year, the directors and section chiefs of the Ministry of Public Security went to the large canteen to eat with ordinary cadres, and the original small stove canteen was changed to a sick ward canteen. The directors and section chiefs also divided their cleaning areas like the cadres, often cleaned the yard, and swept snow with the cadres after the heavy snow. Xu Zhiyin, Director of the Labor and Wages Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, rarely participated in the social activities of the bureau in the past. From 1954 to before the rectification, she had not participated in the trade union group meetings. Now she participates in all meetings of the trade union group and regularly studies work with the trade union committee. In the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, few leading cadres participated in collective activities such as voluntary labor, trade union life, and work-break exercises in the past, and some people even enjoyed special treatment in life. Now these phenomena of being divorced from the masses and special treatment have been changed, and special care in life has also been actively cancelled.

    Caring about the Ideology and Life of the Masses and Closer Relations between Superiors and Subordinates
    The leading cadres of many units have also further cared about the ideology and life of the masses, and understood and helped the masses to solve difficulties. Leading cadres at all levels of many departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry often talk with the masses to understand what opinions the cadres have on work and leaders, what difficulties they have in life, what ideological distresses they have, and what problems need to be solved with the help of the organization. The leading cadres at all levels of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau alone have talked with 300 cadres, accounting for about 70% of the total number of people in the bureau. Zhu Xiangchu, a cadre of the Finance Section of the Basic Construction Bureau of the ministry, had been depressed for a long time because of his bad relationship with his lover. When the leading cadres of the section talked with him, he talked about his problems. After the leaders' enlightenment and help, his mood improved. In the previous period, many designers of the Coal Preparation Research and Design Institute of the Ministry of Coal Industry worked overtime at night, but the heating in the office was not hot and the temperature was very low. After Dean Yang Zesheng discovered this, he immediately presided over the adjustment of the office. Lu Zezhong, Dean of the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute of the ministry, used to have a stiff attitude and rarely approached the masses. Now he goes to the cadres' dormitory with his comrades on Wednesday and Saturday evenings and Sundays to participate in recreational activities or have heart-to-heart talks. Once he went to a dormitory and found that a water pipe was broken, he immediately notified the relevant unit and repaired it quickly. Because he cared about the suffering of the masses and his attitude became amiable and approachable, many cadres took the initiative to talk to him, and even family trivial matters were willing to ask him for help to solve.

### 官风开始消散　朝气正在发扬  中央国家机关一般性整改后领导作风大转变

    官风开始消散　朝气正在发扬
    中央国家机关一般性整改后领导作风大转变
    本报讯　中央国家机关许多单位的领导作风有了改进。这是经过整风运动一般性整改阶段之后出现的新气象之一。
  深入下层了解情况
    自己动手改写公文
    领导作风改进的突出标志，是许多领导干部在工作中亲自动手，改变了过去那种不大接触实际、过多地依靠下级办事的作风。对外贸易部过去召开大型会议，部领导干部一般不参加准备工作。最近，该部将召开对资本主义国家出口工作会议。在会议准备期间，李哲人副部长亲自到所属九个公司了解情况，研究问题；每次下去半天时间，已经连续了九天。这对提高会议的质量提供了可靠的保证。煤炭工业部在整风运动之前，除少数重要文电外，大量公文都由秘书办理，司、局长的“签名章”交由秘书掌握，因此，许多文件中反映的问题，司、局长根本不能知道。整改之后，“签名章”取消了，所有司、局长都亲自起草和核批公文。地方工业局副局长阎植三在整改后已经动手拟出“如何发挥地方煤炭工业的积极性”、“1958年地方工业工作安排”等较重要的文件。他并且提出了处理公文的详细意见，使下级干部在处理公文时有所遵循。冶金工业部基本建设局的各种总结、报告，过去都是由作具体工作的干部负责起草，领导干部很少动手，因而质量不高。现在，副局长王铁云召集大家研究情况之后，已对五年来部的基本建设计划的工作，总结了经验教训。对这个总结，各方面都比较满意。在冶金工业部，许多司长、局长、院长、所长，都开始摆脱办公室、会议桌的羁绊，直接深入下层了解情况，解决问题。设计局局长还规定了至少每两周深入北京各设计院一次的经常制度。教育部所属人民教育出版社副社长吴伯肖，现在每星期定期到所领导的各编辑室办公半天，就地研究处理问题，改变了过去工作不深入、解决问题不及时的缺点。
    一些负有领导责任的高级工程技术人员，在整改以后，领导作风同样有很大改进。如冶金工业部有色研究所工程师杨长全、曹蓉江、王金堂等，不久以前亲自到试验室解决了锗的爆炸问题，使锗的氯化蒸馏实收率由30％到40％提高到90％。
  领导亲自接待来访
    拖拉现象大大减少
    领导作风改进的另一表现，是办事拖拉的现象大大减少了。下面的两件事情最能说明这种转变。最近，包头有人到煤炭工业部来谈煤价问题。这类问题，在过去是由一般干部接谈的，因而问题往往不能很快解决，而且解决得不够好，以至拖延时日。这次，销售局副局长刘克先亲自出面接谈，使问题当时就得到解决。冶金工业部有色局所属四○一厂来北京出差的干部谈到，去年来北京找部、局办三件事，整整花了七天的时间，而这次来办同样性质的三件事，只花了六个钟头。他谈到，处长、科长在接待的时候，态度也很亲切，而过去却感到是进了大机关，“站不是，坐也不是”。在中央国家机关一些单位中，办事拖拉、敷衍、摆大架子、态度生硬的官风正在被清扫，代之而起的是蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气和谦虚的作风。
    经常参加社会活动和群众打成一片
    中央国家机关许多单位的领导干部除了在工作作风上有上述改进之外，在日常生活作风上也更加接近群众，和群众打成一片。公安部早在去年8月间，局长、处长就到大食堂和一般干部一起用饭，原来的小灶食堂改为病号食堂。局处长们还同干部们一样划分了自己的清洁范围，经常打扫院子，大雪之后和干部们一起扫雪。铁道部劳动工资局的局长徐芝寅，过去很少参加局内的社会活动，从1954年起到整风以前，没有参加过工会小组会。现在她参加了工会小组的一切会议，并且定期地同工会委员会研究工作。在冶金工业部，义务劳动、工会生活、工间操等集体活动，过去领导干部很少有人参加，有些人生活上还享受特殊待遇。现在这些脱离群众的特殊化的现象已经得到改变，对生活上的特殊照顾也主动取消了。关心群众的思想和生活上下之间关系更加密切
    许多单位的领导干部还进一步关心群众的思想和生活，了解和帮助群众解决困难。冶金工业部很多司局的各级领导干部，经常和群众交谈，了解干部对工作、对领导还有些什么意见，生活上有些什么困难，思想上有些什么苦闷，有那些问题需要组织上帮助解决。仅有色局的各级领导干部就和三百名干部谈过话，占全局总人数的70％左右。该部基建局财务处干部朱香初，因为和爱人关系不好，长期以来都很苦闷。在处的领导干部和他谈心时，他把自己的问题谈了出来，经过领导的开导和帮助，情绪有了好转。煤炭工业部选煤研究设计院在前一个时期，许多设计人员夜间加班工作，但办公室暖气不热，温度很低，院长杨泽生发现后，立即主持调整了办公室。该部北京煤矿设计院院长陆泽中过去态度生硬，很少接近群众，现在则在每星期三、六的晚上和星期日，到干部宿舍和同志们一起参加文娱活动，或促膝谈心。一次他到一个宿舍去，发现有个自来水管坏了，便立即通知有关单位，很快修理好了。由于他关心群众的疾苦，而且态度变得和蔼可亲，许多干部就主动找他谈心，甚至连家庭琐事也愿意请他帮助解决。
