The Second Session of the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province enthusiastically discussed the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft). During the discussions, the representatives used methods of comparing outputs, contrasting high and low levels, and identifying causes to summarize and exchange a large number of experiences in achieving high yields and abundant harvests, and they seriously criticized right-leaning conservative ideas. Everyone unanimously believed that the grain production targets and other major indicators stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) could not only be achieved in Zhejiang but could also be achieved ahead of schedule within the Second Five-Year Plan or a slightly longer period. Therefore, the Congress unanimously passed a resolution calling on all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the people of the province to bring out their revolutionary drive and strive to achieve the grain and other major production targets stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. This resolution profoundly reflects the strong will and revolutionary optimism of the Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the people of the province, especially the vast number of peasants. It will powerfully motivate people to overcome all difficulties and make great efforts to build a new socialist countryside.

The forty articles of the National Program for Agricultural Development are our great program for building a new socialist countryside. Its enormous power was already demonstrated in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956. Under its encouragement and inspiration, people were able to unleash limitless strength and boundless wisdom. This year, thanks to the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, and thanks to the great debate on the two roads in the countryside, the socialist upright wind has overwhelmed the capitalist evil wind, creating very favorable ideological and political conditions for the upsurge in winter agricultural production. Therefore, this year's upsurge in winter production in our province, compared with the winter of 1955, has the characteristics of being larger in scale, faster in action, more planned, and more organized. Now, from cities to villages, from government offices, factories, schools, and shops to agricultural cooperatives, from intellectuals to peasants, tens of thousands of people are taking action. Government cadres and intellectuals are all eager to try, preparing to respond to the Party's call at any time to go to the countryside, with some already taking up agricultural production posts and starting new lives and labor. Leading organs at all levels in industry, handicrafts, commerce, transportation, finance, banking, culture, education, and health are all actively formulating plans to serve agricultural production. The vast number of rural work cadres and peasants have long been engaged in intense labor, actively carrying out water conservancy projects, accumulating and producing fertilizer, cultivating spring seedlings, developing sideline occupations, and planting trees and afforestation. High mountains, deep valleys, plains, rivers, and the vast ocean are all filled with a new atmosphere.

Whether the National Program for Agricultural Development can be achieved ahead of schedule, and whether there is courage to promote a great leap forward in agricultural production on the current basis, there is a struggle between two opposing ideologies—positive and negative—in people's minds. Those who have courage and dare to act are the "promoters" of our cause; those who lack courage and harbor endless worries are the "obstructors." Promoters and obstructors will have two fundamentally different views on any matter and will draw two fundamentally different conclusions.

First, let's take the experiences and lessons of agricultural production during the First Five-Year Plan. In the eyes of the promoters, the experience of the First Five-Year Plan proves that agricultural production can take a great leap forward and that the National Program for Agricultural Development can be achieved ahead of schedule. Because during the First Five-Year Plan, the average per-mu yield of grain in Huangyan, Wenling, and the suburban areas of Wenzhou, and the per-mu yield of cotton in Cixi County, had already reached the targets set by the National Program for Agricultural Development. In addition, many cooperatives and many townships have also achieved this target. Why can these places do it, while other places cannot do it even after a few more years? Moreover, it should be seen that the Second Five-Year Plan has more favorable conditions than in the past: the small-peasant economy has been replaced by the cooperative economic system; cadres and the masses have more experience than in the past; and socialist industry will provide more assistance to agriculture. Seeing these situations, they are full of confidence and enthusiasm. The same situation is completely different in the eyes of the obstructors. They draw a conclusion from the fact that some counties, such as Longyou, Quzhou, and Tiantai, did not increase or even decreased production during the First Five-Year Plan: agricultural production is unstable, disasters occur every year, and production can only increase slightly, and sometimes it even regresses. They attribute the fact that other places have achieved large-scale increases in production to accidental phenomena, which are "uniquely blessed." They actually deny the possibility of achieving the National Program for Agricultural Development. Therefore, they lack vitality in their work, exaggerate difficulties, and are lifeless and stagnant.

It is the same in dealing with natural conditions. In the eyes of the promoters, natural conditions do have a great relationship to production, so they are determined to transform nature and find ways to increase production that are suitable for the local natural conditions. Facts have proved that as long as this is done, it is possible to overcome poor mountains and bad waters, transform nature, and achieve increased production. The deeds of Tongshan Township in Zhuji, which were previously published in this newspaper, are a clear example. The obstructors, on the other hand, are slaves to nature. In their view, people can only wait for the gifts of nature, and those places with poor natural conditions can only maintain the status quo and cannot increase production. In their view, it is not enough for the National Program for Agricultural Development to divide the country into three types of regions; it cannot include the "special circumstances" in their areas. Therefore, while other places are vigorously carrying out water conservancy projects, improving soil, and building terraced fields, their places are still cold and deserted, and no action can be seen.

On the issue of who to rely on to achieve the National Program for Agricultural Development, promoters and obstructors also have fundamental differences. In the eyes of the promoters, to achieve the National Program for Agricultural Development, it is necessary to rely on the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the masses and to rely on agricultural cooperatives to continuously increase public accumulation. Therefore, they pay great attention to running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily, educating peasants to put the development of production and expanded reproduction first, and to put improving living standards on a solid foundation of gradually developing production. They also pay attention to careful calculation in various tasks, paying attention to achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. The obstructors have a completely different idea. They believe that to achieve the National Program for Agricultural Development, the state must provide a large amount of investment and materials, otherwise it is impossible. They want state loans to build water conservancy projects, state loans to buy fertilizers and agricultural tools, the state to supply more grain for raising pigs, the state to supply more rations during the busy farming season, and even the state to pay wages for repairing roads. As a result, the masses in their areas have money to buy wool fabrics and yarn, spending hundreds of yuan on a single wedding, but no one is willing to spend money to repair water conservancy projects, buy agricultural tools, or purchase tree seedlings. As a result, many urgent matters in production have to be put on hold.

In terms of promoting advanced production increase experiences, promoters and obstructors also hold completely opposite attitudes. In the eyes of the promoters, to increase production and achieve the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, it is necessary to promote advanced experiences. Learning and applying advanced experiences is the conscious requirement of the broad masses, especially the masses with a high level of socialist consciousness. They advocate standing in front of the masses and leading them forward. Therefore, they pay attention to using various methods, such as exhibitions, visits and comparisons, technical instruction, and inviting experienced masters, so that typical advanced experiences can be quickly promoted, blossom and bear fruit, and transform from small-area production increases to large-area production increases. The obstructors lack sensitivity to advanced things, stick to conventions, and dare not boldly promote advanced experiences. In their view, there is a great danger in promoting advanced experiences, and the old methods are more stable. They always emphasize that the masses are not accustomed to them and do not accept them, without patiently persuading and educating the masses or personally conducting experiments. Therefore, the advanced experiences in their areas have been promoted in other places, achieving significant results, but in their areas they are still "typical" and even become extinct.

Achieving the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule is a glorious cause, but it is also an extremely arduous cause, and there must be difficulties. However, promoters and obstructors also have fundamental differences in their attitudes towards difficulties. Promoters are better able to see problems comprehensively, seeing both the difficult side and the favorable side, so they can fully utilize positive factors and overcome difficulties. The obstructors, on the other hand, often only see difficulties, exaggerate difficulties, and are helpless and afraid of difficulties in the face of them.

We are communists, we are liberated working people, our Party is a symbol of the progress of the times and society, and our working people are the creators of history. Therefore, we should all be promoters in the cause of revolution and construction, and we should not be obstructors. However, after all, there are many obstructors in our ranks. What is the reason for this?

It should be pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon, in addition to ideological reasons, there is also a social root. The long-term feudal rule and the production relations of the decentralized small-peasant economy have shackled the development of agricultural productive forces, causing agricultural production to stagnate for a long time, and sometimes even regress, leaving people with a deep impression that agricultural production is destined not to take a great leap forward, but can only develop in a crawling manner. Although the relations of production have now changed and the productive forces have been liberated, some people's thinking has not changed all at once, and they still look at new problems with old eyes. This phenomenon will be unavoidable for a considerable period of time. The problem is whether we can often contact the advanced, pay attention to new things, and often use the advanced and new things to drive out the old and backward things in our minds. Here, the transformation of the objective world and the transformation of the subjective world are consistent.

The train of the times is advancing rapidly, and the beautiful prospects of socialism are waiting for us. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and peasant brothers and sisters of the whole province! Laborers on all fronts! Let us act! Use our own hands to build a new socialist countryside!

    是促进派，还是促退派？
    一九五七年十二月三十一日浙江日报社论
    中共浙江省第二届代表大会第二次会议，热烈地讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。在讨论中，代表们采用了摆产量、比高低、找原因的办法，总结和交流了大量的高额丰产的经验，严肃地批判了右倾保守思想。大家一致认为：全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的粮食生产指标和其他各种主要指标，在浙江不仅可以实现，而且可以争取在第二个五年计划或稍多一点的时间内提早实现。因此，代表大会一致通过决议，号召全省共产党员、共青团员和全省人民，拿出革命的干劲来，为提早实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的粮食和其他主要的生产指标而奋斗。这个决议，深刻地反映了全省共产党员、共青团员和全省人民特别是广大农民的坚强意志和革命的乐观主义精神，它将有力地推动人们克服一切困难，为建设社会主义新农村而作极大的努力。
    农业发展纲要四十条，是我们建设社会主义新农村的伟大纲领。它的巨大威力，早在1955年冬季和1956年春季就已表现出来，在它的鼓舞和激励之下，人们能够发挥出无限的力量和无穷的智慧。今年，由于进行了整风和反右派斗争，由于在农村中进行了两条道路的大辩论，社会主义的正风压倒了资本主义的歪风，更给冬季农业生产高潮创造了思想上和政治上非常有利的条件。因此，今年本省冬季生产的高潮和1955年冬季比较，具有规模更大、行动更快、更有计划、更有组织等特点。现在，从城市到乡村，从机关、工厂、学校、商店到农业合作社，从知识分子到农民，千千万万的人都正在行动起来，机关干部和知识分子一个个跃跃欲试，准备着随时响应党的号召，带笔从农，有的已经走上了农业生产的岗位，开始了新的生活和劳动；工业、手工业、商业、交通运输业、财政金融和文化、教育、卫生事业的各级领导机关，都正在积极地制订为农业生产服务的规划；广大农村工作干部和农民，早已投入了紧张的劳动，积极进行兴修水利、积肥造肥、培育春花、发展副业、植树造林等。高山深谷、平原河川、辽阔海洋，到处洋溢着一片新气象。
    农业发展纲要能不能提早实现，是否有勇气促进农业生产在现在的基础上来一个大跃进，在人们的思想上，存在着积极和消极两种对立思想的斗争。有勇气、敢作敢为的人，是我们事业的“促进派”；没有勇气、怀着无穷忧虑的人，是“促退派”。促进派和促退派，对于任何事物都会有两种根本不同的看法，都会得出两种根本不同的结论。
    先拿对待第一个五年计划期间农业生产的经验教训来说。在促进派看来，第一个五年计划期间的经验证明，农业生产可以来一个大跃进，农业发展纲要可以提早实现。因为在第一个五年计划期间，黄岩、温岭、温州市郊区等县市的粮食和慈溪县的棉花，平均亩产量都已达到全国农业发展纲要所规定的指标；此外，还有许多合作社、许多乡都达到了这个指标。为什么这些地方能办到，而其他地方再经过几年还不能办到呢？不仅如此，还应当看到第二个五年计划期间比过去具备了更多的有利条件：小农经济已经被合作经济制度代替了；干部和群众的经验比过去更多了；社会主义工业将对农业提供更多的援助。看到了这些情况，因而他们信心百倍，干劲十足。同样的情况，在促退派看来，则完全是另一回事。他们从有些县如龙游、衢县、天台等县在第一个五年计划期间没有增产或者减产的事实中，得出一条结论，即：农业生产不稳定，灾害年年有，只能少量增产，有时还要倒退。他们把其它地方获得大量增产的事实，一概归为偶然现象，是“得天独厚”。他们实际上否定了实现农业发展纲要的可能性。因此，他们在工作中缺乏朝气、夸大困难、死气沉沉。
    在对待自然条件方面也是一样。在促进派看来，自然条件确实对生产有很大的关系，因而下定了改造自然的决心，寻找适合当地自然条件的增产办法。事实证明，只要这样做就可以战胜穷山恶水，改造自然，获得增产。以前本报发表过的诸暨同山乡的事迹就是明显的例证。促退派与此相反，他们是自然界的奴隶。在他们看来，人只能等待自然的恩赐，那些自然条件不好的地方就只能维持现状，不能增产。在他们看来，农业发展纲要把全国分为三种类型地区还不够，还不能包括他们那里的“特殊情况”。因此，其他地方已经轰轰烈烈兴修水利、改良土壤、修筑梯田，他们那里还冷冷清清，看不到动静。
    在依靠谁来实现农业发展纲要的问题上，促进派和促退派也有根本性的分歧。在促进派看来，实现农业发展纲要一定要依靠群众的人力、物力和财力，依靠农业合作社不断地增加公共积累。因而他们十分注意勤俭办社、勤俭持家，教育农民把发展生产扩大再生产放在第一位，把改善生活放在逐步发展生产的稳妥基础之上，并且在各种工作中注意精打细算，注意又多又快又好又省。促退派则完全是另一种想法，他们认为实现农业发展纲要，就要国家拿出大批投资和物资，否则就不可能。他们修水利要国家贷款，购买肥料农具也要国家贷款，养猪要国家多供应粮食，农忙要国家多供应口粮，甚至修道路要国家发工资。因而他们那里的群众却有钱买呢子、买毛线，结婚一次花几百元，但是没有人肯拿钱修水利、买农具、购树苗。结果，只好把生产上许多急需办的事情搁置下来。
    在推广先进的增产经验方面，促进派和促退派也持有完全相反的态度。在促进派看来，要增产，要提早实现全国农业发展纲要，一定要推广先进经验。学习和运用先进经验，是广大群众特别是社会主义觉悟高的群众的自觉要求。他们主张站在群众的前面，领导群众前进。因此，他们注意运用各种办法，如展览会、参观评比、技术传授、请老师傅等，使典型的先进经验迅速推广，开花结果，由小面积增产变为大面积增产。促退派对先进的事物缺乏敏感，墨守陈规，不敢大胆推广先进经验。在他们看来，推广先进经验有很大的危险性，不如老办法稳当。他们老是强调群众不习惯，不接受，而不对群众进行耐心的说服教育，不亲自动手进行试验。因此，他们那里的先进经验在其他地方推广了，获得了显著的效果，但在他们那里仍然是“典型”，甚至绝了种。
    提早实现农业发展纲要是光荣的事业，同时，也是异常艰巨的事业，困难一定是有的。但是促进派和促退派在对待困难的态度方面也有根本分歧。促进派比较能够全面地看问题，既看到困难的一面，也看到有利的一面，因而他们能够充分发挥积极因素，克服困难。促退派则往往只看困难，夸大困难，在困难面前束手无策，消极畏难。
    我们是共产党人，我们是解放了的劳动人民，我们党是时代和社会进步的标志，我们劳动人民是历史的创造者。因此，我们在革命和建设事业当中都应当是促进派，而不应当是促退派。但是，在我们的队伍中，毕竟有许多人是促退派，这是什么原因呢？
    应当指出：所以出现这种现象，除了认识上的原因以外，还有一种社会根源。长时期来的封建统治和分散的小农经济的生产关系束缚着农业生产力的发展，使农业生产长期处于停滞状态，有时甚至倒退，给人们留下一个深刻的印象，好像农业生产注定了不会大跃进，只能以爬行方式发展。现在生产关系虽然变了，生产力获得了解放，但是有些人的思想一下子还转不过来，还用老眼光看新问题。这种现象在一个相当长的时期内将是难免的。问题在于能否经常接触先进，重视新生事物，经常用先进的、新生的东西，驱除思想上陈旧的、落后的东西。在这里，改造客观世界和改造主观世界是一致的。
    时代的列车在飞速前进，社会主义的美好前景在等待着我们。全省的共产党员们！共青团员们！农民兄弟们！各个战线上的劳动者们！行动起来吧！用自己的双手来建设社会主义的新农村！
