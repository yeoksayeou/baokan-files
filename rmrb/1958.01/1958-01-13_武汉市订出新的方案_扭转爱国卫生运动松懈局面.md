Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan – At a plenary meeting of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee held on the 8th, a new plan for carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign to eliminate the Four Pests was adopted. The plan aims to reverse the previous slackening of the Patriotic Health Campaign in the city, catch up, and launch a high tide of "eliminating the Four Pests and paying attention to hygiene" with everyone participating.

According to this new plan, from now until the end of March, a concentrated campaign to "eliminate the Four Pests and pay attention to hygiene" will be carried out throughout the city to comprehensively eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies, rats, and sparrows in the suburbs. This campaign requires "leaders to take the lead, cadres to take action, and everyone to participate." Each district should have one to several "Four-Without" (no rats, no flies, no mosquitoes, no bedbugs) streets, townships, or communes. As the campaign deepens, patriotic health covenants will be further formulated, and systems will be established and improved to regularize the Patriotic Health Campaign.

The plan also stipulates that the Wuhan Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and relevant departments should establish special groups to vigorously strengthen the publicity of common knowledge about eliminating the Four Pests and hygiene, ensuring that it is well-known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Special efforts will also be made to study and resolve problems related to garbage, feces, street cleaning, stagnant water and sewage, and food hygiene.

In the past, due to insufficient and shallow publicity and ideological work, and the relaxation of regular leadership by leading departments, Wuhan's hygiene campaign had limited effectiveness and unstable results. The problems of garbage, feces, sewage, lakes, ponds, and ditch disposal have not been properly resolved for a long time.

    武汉市订出新的方案
    扭转爱国卫生运动松懈局面
    据新华社武汉讯　在8日举行的武汉市人民委员会全体会议上，通过了一项开展除四害爱国卫生运动的新的方案，决定扭转过去市内爱国卫生运动松懈的局面，迎头赶上，掀起一个人人动手的“除四害、讲卫生”突击运动的高潮。
    根据这个新的方案，要求从即日起到3月底止，在全市范围内开展“除四害、讲卫生”的突击运动，全面歼灭过冬蚊蝇、老鼠和郊区的麻雀。这一运动要求“领导带头、干部动手、人人参加”，每个区要做到有一个到数个四无街道、乡或社。随着运动的逐步深入展开，将进一步订立爱国卫生公约，建立和健全制度，使爱国卫生运动经常化。
    这个方案还规定由武汉市爱国卫生运动委员会和有关部门成立专门小组，大力加强除四害卫生常识的宣传工作，作到家喻户晓、深入人心。并且专门研究和解决垃圾、粪便、街道清洁、积水污水和食品卫生等问题。
    武汉市的卫生运动过去由于宣传和思想工作不深不透，领导部门放松了经常领导，以致爱国卫生运动效果不大，成绩也不稳定，垃圾、粪便、污物、湖塘和沟道的处理问题长期没有得到妥善解决。
