    Wholehearted or Halfhearted
    Yi Huai

    Although the time that cadres have been sent to lower levels in various places is not very long, many comrades have already wholeheartedly devoted themselves to the production and life of agricultural cooperatives. They are not just formally eating, living, and working with the farmers, but are enthusiastically learning from the farmers' excellent qualities—diligence and thrift—cultivating the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and becoming familiar with all aspects of rural life. Many cadres who have been sent to lower levels miss their "home" whenever they leave the village to attend meetings in the county for a few days. Many comrades have already developed the feeling of "sharing joys and sorrows with the farmers," worrying with the farmers about drought and frost, and rejoicing together over the general winter rains that relieve the drought. Many comrades feel excited and proud that they can contribute to the struggle to realize the National Agricultural Development Program.

    There are also comrades who have been sent down to participate in labor who have adopted a different attitude. They also eat, live, and work with the farmers, they also have blisters on their hands, and they also swallow coarse food. However, these comrades are very different from those mentioned above. If the former comrades have wholeheartedly thrown themselves into the fiery struggle in the countryside, these comrades can only be said to be halfhearted. In the depths of their hearts, they still retain an intellectual's "spiritual kingdom," which they do not allow the outside world to touch. They eat the same food and do the same work as the members of the cooperative, but they do not think about the same things. They do not understand or are not interested in what problems or difficulties the cooperative has, or what kind of struggle is currently being carried out. Autumn harvest distribution, which is the most important thing that cooperative members care about in a year, does not interest them, and some even feel that it is a selfish and backward manifestation when farmers discuss this matter. When the farmers find them during rest periods to talk and play, they just read their thick books. The problem between them and the farmers is not just a language barrier, but mainly a lack of a common language. They always want to retain as much as possible their intellectual interests and sentiments, and are unwilling to cultivate common interests and hobbies with the peasant masses. They would rather lock themselves in their rooms and sing than go to the masses to "rejoice with the people." When they turn on the radio, the farmers like to listen to local operas, but they insist on listening to their favorite light music. In the words of some people, this is called "being a farmer during the day and an intellectual at night."

    Is it better to wholeheartedly throw oneself into the entire struggle in the countryside, or is it better to "be a farmer during the day and an intellectual at night?" At least, comrades who hold the latter attitude believe that there is not much harm in reserving a small world for intellectuals. They feel that since they do not have to be farmers for the rest of their lives, and they will eventually return to the organs to live the life of intellectuals, there is no need to live exactly like farmers; they feel that as long as they have learned to work and can endure the hard life in the countryside, haven't they exercised and transformed themselves?

    Labor, and the hard rural life, has a great effect on ideological transformation, but if there is a lack of awareness of comprehensively transforming oneself, the effect will not be very great. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve the goal of comprehensively transforming oneself by relying on labor alone. There was such a college student who had been in the countryside for more than half a year, had calluses on his hands, and his face was tanned. He did the hardest and most tiring work. However, he could not feel that there was anything lovely about the countryside, nor could he see anything worth learning from the farmers. He lived out of tune with the farmers and was indifferent to many things in the agricultural cooperative. In this way, after this young man "exercised" for half a year, he felt very depressed and did not feel any ideological gains. He did not know what to do in the future. Why is this? It is because he has not wholeheartedly thrown himself into the various struggles in the countryside and consciously transformed his position, viewpoints, and methods of thinking.

    In fact, the problem is very clear. Since we want to comprehensively transform ourselves in the practice of production struggle and class struggle, we cannot just formally eat, live, and work with the farmers, and we cannot live half the life of an intellectual and half the life of a farmer. To comprehensively transform ourselves, we must first truly become a member of the large army of the countryside marching towards socialism, and wholeheartedly throw ourselves into the production and class struggle for the construction of a new socialist countryside. If we live in an agricultural cooperative without any feelings or interest in it, and do not devote all our efforts to promoting its prosperity and development, can we say that our feelings for the socialist cause are real?

    We say that intellectuals, through labor training, make up for their shortcomings of only having one-sided and incomplete book knowledge. If they lock themselves in their rooms after working in the fields, how can this goal be fully achieved? For intellectuals, the countryside is a vast source of knowledge. Why not take advantage of this rare opportunity to conduct more investigations and research, such as investigating and researching the social conditions and class contradictions and changes in the countryside, and learning to treat all things with the viewpoint of class analysis; investigating and researching the development of production and the series of new problems brought about by the development of production; understanding the changes in the lives of farmers.... Reading is certainly a good thing. As the cultural level of farmers gradually improves, they will also like to read in their spare time. It is worth noting why these comrades are not so enthusiastic about learning from farmers, learning practical production and class struggle knowledge, and becoming familiar with rural conditions. When farmers come to chat and play, isn't this a good opportunity to learn from farmers? Why are they bored with farmers and eager to learn from books?

    We say that we must learn from farmers and have the thoughts and feelings of the working people. We need to understand farmers more comprehensively and deeply from production, life, and various struggles, understand their thoughts and feelings, be familiar with their advantages and disadvantages, and see how socialist thoughts, ideology, and moral qualities grow in them. Only in this way can the healthy thoughts and ideology of the working people gradually replace the negative and unhealthy things in the intellectuals. Some comrades may say that these may all be necessary, but there is not much harm in retaining some intellectual interests and hobbies, right? Of course, intellectuals can have intellectual hobbies and interests. Listening to light music, singing, and reading novels are not bad things; we say that intellectuals should learn from farmers, but we do not mean that intellectuals should be exactly the same as farmers in all aspects and should no longer have any of their own characteristics and hobbies. The problem is that since we live with farmers, since we want to learn from the masses, why can't we cultivate our hobbies and interests more widely? Why not cultivate ourselves to also love those art forms that are popular with the broad masses? There are some issues in the middle that are worth further consideration. Moreover, how can we cultivate the thoughts and feelings of the working people if we do not have common interests with the masses in more aspects?

    Things are afraid of comparison. Those comrades who cannot figure out why they should wholeheartedly devote themselves to rural life may wish to compare and debate with other comrades to see which method has the greater gains and better results. Comparison will naturally reveal the high and low. As long as they truly understand what is good and what is bad, those comrades who adopt bad methods will definitely change their attitude and wholeheartedly throw themselves into the furnace of the rural socialist cause to train themselves to be stronger and more resilient!

    全心全意还是三心二意
    易槐
    尽管各地下放干部的时间还不很长，可是，已经有许多同志全心全意投入农业社的生产和生活中去。他们不是形式上的和农民同吃同住同劳动，而是满怀热情地向农民学习优良品质——勤劳、俭朴，培养劳动人民的思想感情，熟悉农村生活的各个方面。很多下放干部离开住村到县里开上几天会，心里就一直惦念着自己的这个“家”。很多同志已经产生了“同农民共忧乐”的感情，和农民们一起担心天旱，担心霜冻，一起为普降冬雨解除旱象而欢欣鼓舞。很多同志为自己能够在实现农业发展纲要的斗争中贡献一份力量而感到兴奋和自豪。
    下放参加劳动的同志，也有采取另外一种态度的。他们同样和农民同吃同住同劳动，他们手上也磨起了血泡，他们也咽下了粗菜淡饭。可是，这些同志和前面谈到的那些同志还有很大的不同。如果说前面那些同志已经全心全意投入农村的火热斗争的话，这些同志就只能说是三心二意。在他们的心灵深处还保留着一个知识分子的“精神王国”，不许外界去触动它。他们和社员们吃一样的饭、干一样的活，想的却不是一样的事。社里有什么问题，有什么困难，当前在进行什么样的斗争，他们不了解，也不感兴趣。秋收分配，这是一年中社员们最关心的大事，但是他们不感兴趣，农民议论这件事时，有人甚至觉得这是自私落后的表现。农民们在休息时间找他们谈谈玩玩，他们只是看自己的大本头书。他们和农民之间不只是语言不通，主要是缺少共同的语言。他们总想尽可能地保留知识分子的爱好和情调，而不愿培养和农民群众共同的兴趣和爱好，他们宁愿把自己关在房子里唱歌，也不愿到群众中去“与民同乐”。打开收音机，农民爱听地方戏曲，他们偏偏要听自己喜爱的轻音乐。用有些人的话说，这叫做“白天当农民，晚上当知识分子”。
    究竟是全心全意地投入农村的整个斗争中去好呢，还是“白天做农民，晚上做知识分子”好呢？起码，持后一种态度的同志认为给自己保留一个知识分子的小天地并没有多大坏处。他们觉得既然并不要当一辈子农民，终久还是要回到机关过知识分子的生活，有什么必要要生活得完全像农民一样；他们觉得只要学会了劳动，能过农村的艰苦生活，不就是锻炼和改造了自己吗？
    劳动，艰苦的农村生活，对于改造思想的作用是很大的，可是，如果缺少全面改造自己的自觉，效果是不会很大的。而且，仅只靠劳动，也很难达到全面改造自己的目的。有这么一个大学生，他到乡下已经半年多了，手上已经磨起了老茧，脊背面孔也晒得黝黑，最苦的最累的活他都干了。可是，他却感觉不到农村有什么可爱的，也看不出农民身上有什么值得学习的东西。他和农民生活得格格不入，对农业社里的许多事情他不闻不问。就这样，这个青年“锻炼”了半年之后，自己却生活得十分苦闷，感觉不到思想上有什么收获，不知道以后应该怎么办。这是为什么呢？就因为他还没有全心全意投入农村的各项斗争中去，自觉地改造自己的立场、观点和思想方法。
    其实，问题是很清楚的。既然要在生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践中全面改造自己，就不能只是形式上和农民同吃同住同劳动，就不能过着一半知识分子一半农民的生活。全面地改造自己，要求我们首先真正成为农村向社会主义进军的大队伍中的一个成员，全心全意地投入为建设社会主义新农村而进行的生产和阶级斗争中，生活在农业社中，而对这个社没有感情没有兴趣，不倾全力促进它的繁荣发达，这能说我们对社会主义事业的感情是真实的吗？
    我们说知识分子经过劳动锻炼，弥补自己只有片面的不完整的书本知识的缺点，如果在下地劳动之后就把自己关在房子里，这一目的又怎能完全达到呢？对于知识分子来说，农村是浩如烟海的知识源泉，为什么不可以利用这个难得的机会，更多地进行一些调查研究，比如，调查研究农村社会情况和农村阶级矛盾以及变化情况，学会用阶级分析的观点来对待一切事物；调查研究生产的发展以及生产的发展所带来的一系列新问题；了解农民生活的变化……。读书当然是好事，农民的文化水平逐步提高以后，在业余时间也会爱好读书的。值得注意的是，这些同志为什么对向农民学习，对学习实际的生产和阶级斗争知识、对熟悉农村情况的热情不那么高呢？农民来找着玩，这不正是向农民学习的好机会吗，为什么对农民厌烦而急于要从书本上学习呢？
    我们说要向农民学习，要具有劳动人民的思想感情，就需要从生产、生活以及各种斗争中，更全面更深刻地去了解农民，懂得他们的思想感情，熟悉他们的优点和缺点，看到社会主义的思想意识道德品质如何在他们身上生长起来。只有这样，劳动人民的健康的思想意识才能逐渐代替知识分子身上的消极的不健康的东西。有些同志或许会说，这些或者都是必要的吧，可是保留一些知识分子的兴趣和爱好总没有多大妨碍吧？当然，知识分子可以有知识分子的爱好兴趣，听轻音乐、唱歌、看小说……也都不是什么不好的事情；我们说知识分子要向农民学习，也并不是说知识分子在各方面都得和农民一模一样，不应再有自己的任何特点和爱好。问题是，既然和农民生活在一起，既然要向群众学习，为什么不可以把自己的爱好和兴趣培养得更广泛一点，为什么不培养自己也同样喜爱那些为广大群众所喜闻乐见的艺术形式呢？这中间是有些问题值得进一步思考的。而且，不在更多方面和群众有共同的兴趣，怎么能够培养起劳动人民的思想感情来呢？
    事情是怕比较的。那些一时想不通为什么要全心全意地投入农村生活的同志，不妨和另一些同志比较辩论一下，看看究竟那种办法的收获大效果好。比较之中自会见出高低。只要真正懂得哪好哪不好，那些采取不好的办法的同志就一定会改变态度，全心全意地投入农村社会主义事业的烘炉里，把自己锻炼得更为健壮坚强！
