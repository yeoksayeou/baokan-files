Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 29th. The Egyptian government issued a statement tonight condemning the establishment of missile bases in Middle Eastern countries, a move that further brings the "Cold War" to the region. The statement points out that this is precisely the purpose of the Baghdad Pact's Ankara meeting.

A spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Egypt is watching with concern the news that some countries in the Middle East may agree to establish nuclear weapons and missile bases on their territory.

The statement said that the establishment of such bases would not only endanger and destroy the people of the entire region, but also destroy the entire Islamic and Christian holy places cherished by Muslims and Christians. At the same time, the region's wealth and prosperity will also be endangered, especially oil and the Suez Canal.

It is reported that Egypt issued this statement after understanding the views of some Asian, African, and Arab countries on the Baghdad Pact and military alliances, as well as on rocket bases, and after explaining its own position to them.

The statement also said: Egypt believes that pursuing a policy of concluding military pacts will exacerbate international tensions and endanger international peace. Therefore, Egypt pursues a policy of active neutrality and non-alignment. Especially on issues related to the Middle East, Egypt must firmly pursue this policy, because its future is inseparable from the future of this region.

It is reported that copies of the statement have been sent to diplomatic envoys of Asian and African countries—especially member states of the Baghdad Pact—and Latin American countries.

Xinhua News Agency, January 30th. TASS, Istanbul, January 29th: Although the organizers of the Baghdad Pact's Ankara meeting officially stated that the issue of setting up American rocket and atomic bases in the territory of the Baghdad Pact member states would not be discussed at this council meeting, news from Ankara regarding the council meeting proves that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has submitted this issue to the meeting participants for discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, January 30th. Ankara News: When the Baghdad Pact Council held a meeting on the morning of the 29th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles announced that the United States was willing to provide a small amount of aid—ten million U.S. dollars—to the four Muslim countries, attempting to eliminate the strong dissatisfaction of these four Muslim countries with the United States' refusal to provide the economic assistance they requested.

The morning meeting on this day approved the report of the treaty's economic committee. Dulles spoke at the meeting, trying his best to slander the Soviet Union's unconditional economic assistance to Middle Eastern countries. In addition to promising to give ten million U.S. dollars as "symbolic assistance," he refused to undertake to provide a larger amount of assistance. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, like Dulles, emphasized that the so-called "obligations" his country assumed were all over the world, thus strictly limiting Britain's ability to provide assistance.

According to Western news agencies, Dulles's speech sparked fierce debate among the four Muslim countries—Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan—which frequently criticized the attitudes of the United States and Britain on the issue of aid. Pakistani Prime Minister Noon expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' preparation to provide India with a large dollar loan. Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal and Turkish Prime Minister Menderes spoke about the dangers their countries faced due to economic weakness and inflation.

The small amount of aid promised by the United States will be used to establish a telecommunications network linking the treaty member states. The amount of this aid only accounts for a very small part of the funds needed to establish the transportation and telecommunications network.

The meeting on the 29th also decided that the Baghdad Pact Council will hold its next meeting in London in July of this year. The final communiqué of the meeting has also been drafted and will be submitted to the Council meeting for approval on the 30th, and then published.

### 埃及外交部发表声明  谴责在中东建立导弹基地  杜勒斯要安卡拉会议讨论在中东配置导弹

    埃及外交部发表声明
    谴责在中东建立导弹基地
    杜勒斯要安卡拉会议讨论在中东配置导弹
    新华社开罗29日电　埃及政府今天晚上发表声明，谴责在中东国家建立导弹基地，而把“冷战”更进一步带到这个地区的做法。声明指出，这种做法正是巴格达条约安卡拉会议的目的。
    埃及外交部发言人在声明中说，埃及关切地注视着传闻中的中东地区某些国家可能同意在它们领土上建立核武器和导弹基地的消息。
    声明说，建立这种基地不仅将使整个地区的人民遭到危险和毁灭，而且将使穆斯林和基督教徒所珍贵的整个伊斯兰教和基督教的圣地遭到毁灭。同时，这个地区的财富和繁荣也将遭受危险，特别是石油和苏伊士运河。
    据悉，埃及是在了解了某些亚非国家和阿拉伯国家对巴格达条约和军事联盟以及对火箭基地的看法以后，并且在向它们解释了埃及自己的立场以后发表这项声明的。
    声明还说：埃及认为，奉行缔结军事公约的政策会加剧国际紧张局势，并且使国际和平遭到危险。因此，埃及奉行积极中立和不参加集团的政策。特别在有关中东的问题上，埃及更加要坚定地奉行这种政策，因为它的未来同这个地区的未来是分不开的。
    据报道，声明的副本已经送交亚非国家——特别是巴格达条约的成员国——和拉丁美洲国家的外交使节。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社伊斯坦布尔29日讯：尽管巴格达条约安卡拉会议的组织者正式说，关于在巴格达条约成员国境内设置美国火箭和原子基地的问题，似乎在这次理事会会议上将不予讨论，但是来自安卡拉的关于理事会会议的消息证明，美国国务卿杜勒斯已经把这个问题提交会议参加国讨论。
    据新华社30日讯　安卡拉消息：巴格达条约理事会29日上午举行会议时，美国国务卿杜勒斯宣布美国愿意向四个穆斯林国家提供一笔小额援助——一千万美元，企图以此来消除这四个穆斯林国家对美国不肯提供它们所要求的经济援助的强烈不满。
    这一天的上午会议通过了条约的经济委员会的报告。杜勒斯在会上发言时，竭力诽谤苏联对中东国家的无条件的经济援助。他除了答应给予一千万美元作为“象征性援助”以外，拒绝承担提供更大量的援助。英国外交大臣劳埃德也像杜勒斯一样，强调所谓他的国家所承担的“义务”遍及全世界，因此严格限制了英国提供援助的能力。
    据西方通讯社透露，杜勒斯的发言使四个穆斯林国家——土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦的辩论激烈起来，这些国家不时批评美英两国对援助问题所持的态度。巴基斯坦总理努恩对于美国准备给印度一大笔美元贷款表示不满。伊朗首相埃格巴尔和土耳其总理曼德列斯谈到了他们的国家由于经济弱点和通货膨胀而遭到的危险。
    美国允诺的这一小笔援助将用来建立联结条约成员国的电讯网。这笔援助的数目只占为建立交通和电讯网所需经费的极小一部分。
    29日的会议还决定，巴格达条约理事会将在今年7月在伦敦举行下一次会议。会议的最后公报也已经草拟完毕，将在30日提交理事会会议通过，然后发表。
