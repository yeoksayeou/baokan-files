Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 7th: The President of the International Union of Students (IUS), Mr. Běilìkāng (likely a transliteration, as it does not easily correspond to a Chinese name), delivered a major report at the IUS Executive Committee meeting on the tasks of the IUS in the current situation of the international student movement and on the convening of the Fifth World Student Congress.

    When discussing the current situation of the international student movement, Běilìkāng said that the majority of the IUS member organizations strongly oppose the tendency to provoke a new Cold War and deepen existing divisions in the student movement, and have established the principle that international tensions and differences of opinion should not be obstacles to expanding cooperation and understanding.

    Běilìkāng said that the increasingly active role played by students and student organizations, together with the people, in avoiding the danger of a new war is the most prominent feature of this period. Another important feature is the increasingly frequent activities of students in the struggle against colonialism and for national independence, as well as in supporting students in colonial countries.

    Běilìkāng said that the main tasks of the IUS in the future are: to develop bilateral cooperation between IUS members and non-members; to develop regional cooperation, the importance and scope of which has recently increased; to organize various forums, conferences, and other activities organized by national student unions, independent of international organizations or with broad support, welcoming all student organizations to participate without any political discrimination; and to improve relations between the IUS and other international student organizations.

    Běilìkāng emphasized that the Fifth World Student Congress and its preparation period will be a good opportunity to strive for a comprehensive improvement in the work of the IUS, and an opportunity for student organizations to intensify their activities to meet student demands within their own countries and to enhance the role of national organizations in resolving the most acute problems in the international student movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 6th: The IUS Executive Committee began its six-day meeting in Leipzig today. The main agenda items are: preparations for convening the Fifth World Student Congress and the tasks of the IUS in 1958.

    At today's meeting, the Secretariat of the International Union of Students recommended to the Executive Committee that it accept the invitation from the All-China Students' Federation to hold the Fifth World Student Congress in Beijing in September this year.

    据新华社来比锡7日电　国际学生联合会主席贝利康6日在国际学联执行委员会会议上作了关于目前国际学生运动形势下的国际学生联合会的任务和关于召开第五届世界学生代表大会的主要报告。
    贝利康在谈到目前国际学生运动形势时说：国际学生联合会大多数会员组织都强烈地反对在学生运动中挑起新的冷战和加深现存的分裂的倾向，并且确定了关于国际紧张局势和意见分歧不应该成为扩大合作和谅解的障碍的原则。
    贝利康说：学生和学生组织同人民一道在避免新战争危险方面所起积极作用愈来愈大，这是这一时期最突出的特征。另一重要特征是学生在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争中以及在支持殖民地国家学生方面的活动愈来愈频繁。
    贝利康说：国际学生联合会今后的主要任务是：发展国际学生联合会会员和非会员之间的双边合作；发展地区合作，最近这种合作的重要性和范围日益增长；组织各种由各国学联组织的、同国际组织无关或是得到大家支持的讨论会、会议以及种种其他活动，这种种活动毫无政治歧视地欢迎一切学生组织参加；改善国际学生联合会和其他国际学生组织相互间的关系。
    贝利康着重谈到，第五届世界学生代表大会和它的准备期间将是争取全面改善国际学生联合会的工作的好机会，并且是各个学生组织加紧进行活动以便在一国范围内满足学生要求并且提高各国组织在解决国际学生运动中最尖锐的问题方面的作用的机会。
    据新华社来比锡6日电　国际学联执行委员会今天开始在来比锡举行为期六天的会议。主要议程是：召开第五届世界学生代表大会的筹备事宜和国际学联1958年的任务。
    国际学生联合会书记处在今天的会议上向执行委员会建议接受中华全国学生联合会的邀请：今年9月间在北京召开第五届世界学生代表大会。
