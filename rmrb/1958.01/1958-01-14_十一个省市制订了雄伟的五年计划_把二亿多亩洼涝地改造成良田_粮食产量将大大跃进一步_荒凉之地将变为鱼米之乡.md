Xinhua News Agency, Yangliuqing, January 13th: The nine provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, and the two municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, which together account for more than half of the country's cultivated land, have decided to basically eliminate common waterlogging disasters during the Second Five-Year Plan period, thereby greatly increasing grain production. This was proposed in the ambitious plan for a major campaign against low-lying waterlogged areas, formulated at the Eleven Provinces and Cities Low-Lying Area Improvement and Waterlogging Control Conference, which concluded on the 9th.

The plan requires that from 1958 to 1962, all 260 million mu of low-lying waterlogged land in the main disaster areas of the eleven provinces and cities, including Hebei, be transformed into fertile fields. In the low-lying saline-alkali areas, more than 78 million mu of paddy rice and more than 6 million mu of dry rice will be developed. In 1958, the plan calls for completing over 80 million mu of low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control projects, developing over 21 million mu of paddy rice and over 1.9 million mu of dry rice, with yields of 400 to 500 jin or more per mu.

The conference was held in Yangliuqing Town, Tianjin Special District, because Tianjin Special District has rich experience in low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control. Under the leadership of the Party, the peasants of Tianjin Special District, after three years of hard struggle, have transformed many low-lying areas that were plagued by floods year after year, increasing grain production. Many agricultural cooperatives in the low-lying areas have gone from being grain-deficient to having surplus grain, and many disaster victims who relied on state relief year after year have become peasants selling surplus grain to the state. In addition to visiting the Tianjin Special District Low-Lying Area Improvement and Increased Production Exhibition, the delegates spent eight days visiting six low-lying areas with outstanding achievements in low-lying area improvement and increased production, including Kuangergang Beimao in Wuqing County, Tuanbowo in Jinghai County, and Jianchapuwo in Ba County. They visited many agricultural cooperatives in the low-lying areas. Based primarily on the experience of Tianjin Special District, they discussed the experiences of various regions in low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control, and believed that under unified planning, comprehensive management of low-lying areas, turning water hazards into water conservancy, and adopting appropriate measures to reform the production system would lead to a leap forward in agricultural production. Over the past three years, Tianjin Special District, based on its characteristics of being near the Bohai Sea, having a low-lying terrain, and being prone to flooding due to being at the lower reaches of nine rivers, has adopted a policy of focusing on water storage to stabilize water areas, developing paddy rice cultivation, and breeding reeds and fish, fundamentally changing the poor and desolate appearance of rural villages in the low-lying areas and turning them into a land of fish and rice. The delegates believed that the direction of Kuangergang and Tuanbowo is the direction of all low-lying areas in the country.

The conference put forward the following guidelines for future low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control: (1) Overall planning, comprehensive utilization, adapting to local conditions, and studying history; (2) Planting according to local conditions, planting according to water conditions, focusing on increasing grain production, and developing diversified economies; (3) Relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, and combining large, medium, and small-scale projects; (4) Focusing on water storage, supplementing with drainage, combining storage and discharge, and taking into account both upstream and downstream areas; (5) Adapting to, utilizing, restricting, and transforming nature, turning water hazards into water conservancy; (6) Combining water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and crop replanting measures; (7) Combining waterlogging control with irrigation, and emphasizing both construction and management.

He Jifeng, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Conservancy, pointed out in his summary at the conference: Low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control has an important position in agricultural production. Because it is the fundamental problem for the development of agricultural production in low-lying areas, it is an important measure for achieving "four, five, and eight" [referring to the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956-1967], and it is also the key to consolidating and improving agricultural cooperatives in low-lying areas. Because low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control is a large-scale struggle against nature, and it is a long-term, arduous, and complex task, all regions must, under the strong leadership of the Party, unremittingly struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking, rely on the masses, and complete the task of low-lying area improvement and waterlogging control with the heroic spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.

### 十一个省市制订了雄伟的五年计划  把二亿多亩洼涝地改造成良田  粮食产量将大大跃进一步　荒凉之地将变为鱼米之乡

    十一个省市制订了雄伟的五年计划
    把二亿多亩洼涝地改造成良田
    粮食产量将大大跃进一步　荒凉之地将变为鱼米之乡
    新华社杨柳青13日电　耕地面积占全国一半以上的河北、河南、山东、山西、安徽、江苏、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁九省和北京、天津二市，决定在第二个五年计划期内基本消灭普通的水涝灾害，使粮食产量大大跃进一步。这是9日结束的十一省市洼改治涝会议制订的向洼涝地大进军的雄伟计划中提出的。
    这个计划要求，从1958年到1962年内，把我国主要涝灾地区河北等十一个省市的全部洼涝地二亿六千万亩改造成良田，并在洼涝盐碱地区发展水稻七千八百多万亩，旱稻六百多万亩；在1958年，首先要完成八千多万亩的洼改治涝工程面积，发展水稻二千一百多万亩和旱稻一百九十多万亩，每亩稻谷产量达到四百斤或五百斤以上。
    这次会议在天津专区杨柳青镇召开，是因为天津专区有丰富的洼改治涝经验。天津专区农民在党的领导下，经过三年苦战，已经把许多连年受涝的洼地改造好了，粮食增产了，许多洼地的农业社从缺粮变成了余粮，许多过去连年依靠国家救济的灾民变成了卖余粮给国家的农民。参加会议的代表除参观了天津专区洼改治涝展览会外，还用八天时间参观了洼改增产成绩卓著的武清县筐儿港北洼、静海县团泊洼、霸县煎茶铺洼等六处洼地，访问了许多洼地的农业社。他们以天津专区的经验为主，讨论了各地的洼改治涝经验，认为洼涝地区在统一的规划下全面治理，把水害变成水利，配合适宜的改革生产制度的措施，农业生产就能跃进。三年来，天津专区根据地临渤海、地势低洼、是九河下梢易遭涝灾的特点，采取了以蓄水为主固定水区，发展水稻种植和种苇养鱼等多种生产的方针，从根本上改变了洼地农村贫苦、荒凉的面貌，把洼地变为鱼米之乡。代表们认为，筐儿港、团泊洼的方向就是全国所有洼地的方向。
    会议提出了今后洼改治涝的方针。这就是：（一）全面规划，综合利用，因地制宜，研究历史；（二）因地种植，因水种植，以增产粮食为主，发展多种经济；（三）依靠群众，以小型工程为主，大中小型工程相结合；（四）以蓄水为主，以排水为辅，蓄泄兼施，上下游兼顾；（五）适应、利用、限制、改造自然，变水害为水利；（六）兴修水利、改良土壤、农作物改种措施相结合；（七）治涝与灌溉结合，兴修与管理并重。
    水利部副部长何基沣在这次会议的总结中指出：洼改治涝在农业生产上具有重要的地位。因为它是洼涝区发展农业生产的根本问题，是实现“四、五、八”的重大措施，也是巩固和提高洼涝区农业社的关键。由于洼改治涝是大规模地向自然作斗争，是一项长期、艰巨而又复杂的工作，各地必须在党的坚强领导下，不懈地与右倾保守思想做斗争，依靠群众，以愚公移山的英雄气概来完成洼改治涝的任务。
