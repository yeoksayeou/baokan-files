Xinhua News Agency, Jiaozuo, 2nd: Jiaozuo Wangfeng Mine adheres to the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and takes measures to tap the potential of old mines. In the past five years, it has produced a total of more than 5.94 million tons of coal. The profits turned over to the state by this mine can be used to build a new mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the amount of state investment in the reconstruction and addition of machinery and equipment to this mine was only a quarter of the investment in building a new mine with the same output.

    改建后的焦作王封矿
    据新华社焦作2日电焦作王封矿坚持勤俭办企业的方针，采取措施发挥老矿井的潜力，五年来共出产了五百九十四万多吨煤。这对矿井上缴利润，可建设一对年产六十万吨的新矿井。
    在第一个五年计划期间，国家对这对矿井的改建和增加机器设备的投资数额，只相当于新建同样产量新矿井投资的四分之一。
