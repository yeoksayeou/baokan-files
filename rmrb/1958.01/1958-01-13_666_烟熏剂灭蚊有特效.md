“666” Smoker Effective for Mosquito Extermination

Since 1955, Changsha City, Hunan Province, has investigated the habits and species of mosquitoes in urban areas, and proposed methods for eliminating and controlling them. Over the past few years, with the assistance of the Hunan Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Station, Changsha City has trial-produced 666 mosquito coils and 666 smoke powder, using smoke to kill mosquitoes. After more than two years of repeated laboratory and field tests with the above-mentioned drugs, it has been proven to be suitable for mosquito control in sewers with stone slab covers, mud retention wells, water wells, air-raid shelters, basements, and indoors.

The preparation of 666 mosquito coils is as follows: First, take 2.5 kilograms of 666 emulsion, add 10 kilograms of water, then add 0.5 kilograms of potassium nitrate. Then, place 5 kilograms of coarse paper sheets into the medicinal solution and soak until the solution is completely absorbed. Take them out, dry them in the sun, and roll them into paper rolls weighing about 50 centimeters each. One 50-centimeter roll contains about 1.5 grams of 666 beta isomer, which can fumigate 150 cubic meters of space, and has a burning time of about 20 minutes. It will not extinguish even in humid air. For example, when conducting smoke fumigation in sewers, the gaps between the sewers and wells must be filled with waste paper, yellow mud, rags, etc. Then, health and epidemic prevention personnel will light the 666 mosquito coils and simultaneously use 666 wettable powder in some of the sewers with more accumulated water. After the fumigation, Changsha City conducted key inspections of 26 streets on the second and third days, and the results showed that all adult mosquitoes and larvae were dead. However, it had no killing effect on mosquitoes that flew back in, which proves that 666 smoke lacks residual effect.

In order to save paper, Changsha City has also successfully trial-produced 666 smoke powder. This is made by thoroughly mixing 1,250 grams of 6% wettable 666 powder with 1,000 grams of sawdust powder. Then, pour in 2,000 milliliters of 20% crude nitric acid solution (if a higher concentration of smoke is desired, it can be increased to 25%) and stir evenly. Dry it in the sun and then put it in small earthenware jars with ignition wicks attached. During smoke fumigation, hang the earthenware jar by its wick, ignite the wick, and the smoke will gradually increase, with each burning lasting about two to three minutes. When applied, each cubic meter requires two to three grams of smoke powder; for mosquito control in water wells, air-raid shelters, basements, and indoors, one gram is used per cubic meter.

    “666”烟熏剂灭蚊有特效
    湖南省长沙市自1955年开始，调查了市区蚊子生活的习性和蚊种，提出了消灭和控制它的方法。几年来，长沙市在湖南省卫生防疫站的协助下试制了六六六蚊烟卷和六六六烟熏剂粉末，以烟来杀灭蚊虫。经过两年来以上述药物进行实验室和现场的反复试验，证明适用于以石板做盖的下水道阴沟、泥留井、水井、防空洞、地下室和室内灭蚊。
    六六六蚊烟卷的配制是：首先取六六六乳剂二公斤半，加水十公斤，再加硝酸钾半公斤，然后再把五公斤的粗纸分张放进药液里泡浸，待药液全部吸尽，取出晒干，卷成每个约重五十公分的纸卷。一个五十公分重的纸卷约含有六六六丙体一点五公分，可以烟熏一百五十立方公尺的空间，耐燃时间约二十分钟，虽在潮湿的空气中，也不会熄灭。例如在进行阴沟熏烟的时候，必须把沟、井间的缝隙用碎纸、黄泥、破布等填塞好，然后再由卫生防疫人员燃点六六六蚊烟卷，同时对一部分积水比较多的阴沟配合使用六六六可湿剂。长沙市在熏烟后的第二、三天，对二十六条街作重点检查的结果，成蚊和孑孓全部死亡，但对再飞进去的蚊子没有杀灭作用，这证明六六六烟熏还缺乏残留作用。
    为了节约纸张，长沙市又试制成功六六六烟熏剂粉末，这是由6％可湿性六六六粉一千二百五十公分，同锯木粉一千公分，充分混合均匀，再把20％的粗制硝酸液二千毫升（如烟的浓度要大，可以增加到25％）倒进去搅拌均匀，晒干制成，然后用小瓦罐盛装，并在瓦罐上加插引燃线。烟熏时，着引硝把瓦罐挂起，燃点引线，烟雾由小而大，每次耐燃时间约二、三分钟。应用在每一立方公尺需用烟熏剂粉末二、三公分；水井、防空洞、地下室和室内灭蚊，每一立方公尺用一公分。
