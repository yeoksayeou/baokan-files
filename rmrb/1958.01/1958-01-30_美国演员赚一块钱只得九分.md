    American Actors Only Get Nine Cents for Every Dollar Earned
    American film actor Ronald Reagan told a House committee on the 27th that the government taxes actors' income too heavily. Many famous actors actually only get nine cents out of every dollar they earn because 91% is taxed away.
    Reagan said, "Even during the 'boom' years of the past few years, film industry workers have encountered unemployment and hardship."

    美国演员赚一块钱只得九分
    美国电影演员罗纳尔·雷根27日向众议院的一个委员会说，政府对演员的所得税抽得太重了，许多有名演员在每一美元的收入中实际上只拿到了九分钱，因为有91％缴了税。
    雷根说：“就是在过去几年的‘繁荣’时期中，电影业工作人员也碰到了失业和苦难。”
