    Professor's Gains
    ——A Visit with Associate Professor Wu Cangping After Downward Transfer for Labor

    Not long ago, one afternoon, I went to Nanping Village, Xishan Township, Beijing, to visit Wu Cangping, associate professor of the Department of Statistics at Renmin University of China, who was undergoing labor training.

      Became a "Cook"
    A cadre who was sent down led me into Nanping Village, turned several corners, and stopped in front of a small house.
    The small door opened, and a person walked out of the steaming, smoky room. This person was about thirty-five or six years old, wearing a worn-out cotton hat, dressed in a faded gray cotton uniform, sleeves rolled up, hands covered in water and flour. This was Associate Professor Wu Cangping.
    "This week it's my turn to be the 'cook'," Wu Cangping said with a smile, wiping his hands, "Today, we're improving everyone's meal with steamed vegetable buns."
    Our conversation began with the issue of him learning to be a "cook." He said, "In the past, like many intellectuals, I was someone who didn't lift a finger for clothing and opened my mouth for food. Moreover, I was very particular about food, never eating steamed buns, let alone corn buns or cornmeal pancakes. This time, not only can I eat coarse grains, but I've also learned to cook."
    Wu Cangping led me to his residence and continued to talk enthusiastically about the problem of him learning to cook: "Speaking of cooking, especially cooking for many people, I now realize it's not an easy thing. In the beginning, the meals weren't on time, and often the comrades were served half-cooked food. Now, our cooking skills have improved, and we can do coarse grains elaborately and change the variety."

    Why Did He Request Downward Transfer?
    "Some people ask me why I requested a downward transfer?" Wu Cangping said, "It's not difficult to answer this question. I come from an exploiting class family, a bourgeois intellectual. I lived in the old society for more than twenty years and studied in the United States. After returning to China in 1951, the Party gave me a lot of help, enabling me to clear away my pro-American thoughts and bourgeois individualism, have a desire to serve the people, and initially master Marxist-Leninist statistical science, doing some work for the Party and the people. In the last year or two, I started to become complacent, always feeling that I had reformed almost completely and wouldn't have any problems. However, when confronted with any disturbance, I lost my way."
    Wu Cangping gave an example: Last spring, at a symposium for non-Party teachers held by the school's Party committee, the rightist Ge Peiqi openly opposed socialism and the Communist Party, even clamoring to "kill Communists." Wu Cangping also attended this symposium, and like the more than one hundred teachers present at the time, he did not immediately stand up to refute. But later he saw that the attitude of the workers and peasants was not like this. After Ge Peiqi's reactionary remarks were published in the newspapers, batches of workers and peasants came to the school to find Ge Peiqi, and engaged in face-to-face reasoning with him on many major issues of right and wrong without ambiguity. This sharp contrast deeply educated Wu Cangping, he said: "From then on, I suddenly woke up and realized that my standpoint problem had not been resolved, and I lacked deep feelings for the Party and the working class. Since I am determined to take the socialist road, how can I not thoroughly reform myself? Therefore, when the Party put forward the call to send cadres down to the countryside for labor training, I resolutely requested to be sent down to the countryside, to train and reform myself in labor, and transform myself into a true working-class intellectual."

    Putting Down the Pretentions to Learn from the Peasants
    Wu Cangping was sent down to the countryside on October 26 last year. When he first arrived, he didn't understand the peasants at all, and he didn't know how to do any farm work. His physical strength couldn't keep up either. However, Wu Cangping put down his airs and sincerely became a primary school student of the peasants, quickly finding peasant teachers. Now, he has learned many kinds of work, his physical strength has increased, and he can carry a load of about one hundred catties for more than half a kilometer. According to Shu Baorui, the work point recorder of Nanping Village: In the forty-one days of Wu Cangping's actual labor (excluding meetings, cooking, studying, and resting), he has already earned three hundred and twenty-eight work points, averaging eight work points per day.
    Wu Cangping learned a lot from his peasant teachers. He said, "In the past, we taught six or seven hours of classes a week at school and complained that the burden was too heavy and that we didn't have time for personal study. The living conditions at school were already very good, but we still complained that the houses weren't spacious enough, the treatment wasn't high enough, the lights weren't bright enough, and we weren't taken care of well enough. This time, I saw many peasants treating the cooperative as their home, working from dawn till dusk, doing more than ten hours of work a day, never complaining. Some cadres of cooperatives and production teams, forgetting their own interests for the public good, worked in the fields during the day and served the members in the evening, contributing all their energy. In contrast, our intellectual's individualistic thinking that considers personal gains and losses everywhere is too shameful."
    Once, Wu Cangping and the peasant Liu Wanzhi were on the same cart to transport rice straw to Liulang Village. When the cart came to a crossroads, a person wearing an overcoat and a leather hat, riding a bicycle, came speeding towards them. Suddenly, that person shouted, "Hey, how do I get to the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology?" Wu Cangping thought someone was asking for directions, and Liu Wanzhi would definitely answer, but Liu Wanzhi looked at that person, raised his whip, and the cart went faster. Wu Cangping quickly turned around and shouted loudly, "To get to the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, turn east." Later, when he talked about this issue with Liu Wanzhi, Liu Wanzhi – this peasant who had already turned over – told him, "That person saw that we were peasants, and his tone was rough when asking for directions, he didn't even stop his bicycle, he had no manners at all." After finishing this matter, Wu Cangping said to the reporter, "Intellectuals put on airs when they have a little culture, look down on physical labor, and despise the working people. Now it seems, it's really hateful."

    Peasants Praise, Wife Commends
    When I visited for the second time, Wu Cangping and several peasants were turning over cabbages in a cellar in the south of the village. Production team leader Liu Delin and sixty-three-year-old peasant Cai Lian praised Wu Cangping continuously, saying that he was not afraid of getting dirty and did all kinds of work, even vying to carry manure. Liu Delin said, "One night, many people went to dig a well. In order to take care of Lao Wu's health, they didn't let him go, but he ran ahead of everyone else." Cai Lian repeatedly said to the reporter, "Lao Wu has no airs, he talks with us whenever he has time, and he also helps us learn to read. Some time ago, Lao Wu also gave a report to us at the opening ceremony of the literacy class!"
    Wu Cangping's wife, Li Yashu, once studied together in the United States and is now a lecturer in the Department of History at Beijing Normal University. When Wu Cangping applied for downward transfer for labor training, Li Yashu encouraged him in many ways, and gave him a copy of the third issue of "Red Flag Fluttering" magazine, telling him to read the heroic struggles of the revolutionary predecessors if he encountered difficulties. Li Yashu told the reporter: "Wu Cangping has only been working down there for more than two months, but the changes are quite big. In the past, he didn't pay much attention to working people at home. Now it's different. Once, the husband of our child's nanny, Zhu Shaoxia, who is a peasant, came to our house from the countryside. Wu Cangping warmly welcomed him, and the two of them talked about agricultural production and peasant life, talking more and more vigorously. This was rare in the past. Another time, on a Sunday, our family went to visit my younger brother's family. After dinner, the nanny went out, and Wu Cangping went to the kitchen to wash the dishes by himself. Later, when we found out, everyone joined in washing the dishes. (Attached picture)

    教授的收获
    ——访下放劳动的副教授邬沧萍
    新华社记者　任志樵
    不久前的一个下午，记者到北京市西山乡南平庄，访问了正在进行劳动锻炼的中国人民大学统计系副教授邬沧萍。
      当了“火头军”
    一个下放干部领着记者走进南平庄，转了几个弯，在一间小屋的门前停下了。
    小门开处，从烟气腾腾的屋里走出一个人来。这人大约有三十五、六岁的年纪，头上戴着一顶破旧的棉帽，身上穿着一身退了色的灰棉制服，卷着袖子，手上沾满了水和面粉。这就是邬沧萍副教授。
    “这个礼拜轮到我当‘火头军’”，邬沧萍一边擦手，一边笑嘻嘻地说：“今天给大家改善生活，蒸菜包子吃。”
    我们的谈话就从他学会当“火头军”这个问题开始。他说：“过去，我和很多知识分子一样，是一个衣来伸手、饭来张口的人。而且，吃饭方面很讲究，从来不吃馒头，更不用说窝窝头和贴饼子了。这次下来，我不仅能吃粗粮，而且学会做饭了。”
    邬沧萍把我带到他的住处，继续津津乐道地谈他学会做饭的问题：“提起做饭，特别是给很多人做饭，现在才知道是一件很不容易的事情。刚开始，做饭不及时，还常常给同志们吃半生不熟的。现在，我们做饭的技术提高了，已经能够粗粮细做和变换花样了。”
    为什么要求下放？
    “有人问我为什么要求下放？”邬沧萍说：“回答这个问题并不困难。我是出身于剥削阶级家庭的一个资产阶级知识分子，在旧社会生活了二十多年，而且到美国留过学。1951年回国以后，党给了我很多的帮助，使我清算了崇美思想和资产阶级个人主义思想，有了为人民服务的愿望，初步掌握了马列主义的统计科学，给党和人民做了些工作。最近一、两年开始自满起来，总觉得自己改造得差不多了，不会出什么问题了。但是，一遇到风吹草动，就迷失方向了。”
    邬沧萍谈到这里举了一个事例：去年春天，学校党委召开的一次党外教师座谈会上，右派分子葛佩琦公开反对社会主义，反对共产党，甚至叫嚣要“杀共产党人”。邬沧萍也参加了这次座谈会，他和当时在场的一百多位教师一样，没有立即起来驳斥。但是他后来看到：工人、农民们的态度却不是这样的。葛佩琦的这些反动言论在报纸上公布后，成批的工人和农民到学校里来找到葛佩琦，在许多大是大非问题上毫不含糊地同他展开了面对面的说理斗争。这个鲜明的对比，深深地教育了邬沧萍，他说：“从那以后，我才猛醒，发现自己的立场问题还没有解决，对党和工人阶级还缺乏深厚的感情。我既然决心走社会主义道路，不彻底改造怎么行。因此，当党提出了下放干部、劳动锻炼的号召以后，我就坚决要求下放到农村，在劳动中锻炼自己，改造自己，把自己改造成为一个真正的工人阶级知识分子。”
  放下架子向农民学习
    邬沧萍是去年10月26日下放到农村的。刚来的时候，对农民一点不了解，庄稼活什么都不会干，体力也赶不上。但是，邬沧萍放下了架子，诚诚恳恳地当农民的小学生，很快就找到了农民老师。现在，他已经学会了不少活茬，体力也增加了，能够挑一百斤左右的担子走一里多路了。据南平庄的记工员舒宝锐说：邬沧萍实际劳动（除开会、做饭、学习和休息外）的四十一天中，已经得了三百二十八个工分，平均每天得八个工分。
    邬沧萍从农民老师那里学到很多东西。他说：“过去，我们在学校里一个星期教六七个小时课，就叫喊负担过重，没有时间搞个人进修；学校里生活条件已经很好了，还嫌房子不宽，待遇不高，电灯不亮，照顾不好。这次下来，看到很多农民以社为家，起早带晚地劳动，一天干十几个小时的活，从不喊一声累。有些合作社和生产队的干部，公而忘私，白天下地干活，晚上给社员们办事，把他们的精力全都贡献出来了。对比之下，我们知识分子那种处处考虑个人得失的个人主义思想太可耻了。”
    有一次，邬沧萍和农民刘万芝同坐一辆大车去六郎庄运稻草，大车行到一个十字路口，对面有一个穿大衣戴皮帽的人，骑着一辆自行车飞驰而来，忽然那人喊了一声：“喂，到北京钢铁工业学院怎么走？”邬沧萍原以为有人问路，刘万芝一定会回答的，可是刘万芝瞧了瞧那个人，扬起一鞭，马车走得更快了。邬沧萍连忙回过头来大声喊道：“到北京钢铁工业学院，转弯向东就到了。”后来他同刘万芝谈到这个问题的时候，刘万芝——这个已经翻了身的农民就告诉他说：“那个人看见我们是农民，问路都粗声粗气，连自行车都不停，一点礼貌也没有。”邬沧萍在说完这件事后对记者说：“知识分子有了点文化，就摆架子，轻视体力劳动，看不起劳动人民，现在看来，真是可恨。”
  农民夸奖　爱人称赞
    在记者第二次去访问的时候，邬沧萍和几个农民正在村南头的一个菜窖里倒白菜。生产队长刘德林和六十三岁的老农民蔡连续不断地夸奖邬沧萍，说他不怕脏，什么活都干，连抬粪都抢着抬。刘德林说：一天晚上，很多人去打井，为了照顾老邬身体，不让他去，可是他却跑在头里。”蔡连续连连地向记者说：“老邬没有架子，有空就和我们谈心，还帮助我们识字，前些时候，老邬还在民校开学典礼会上给我们做报告呢！”
    邬沧萍的爱人李雅书，曾经在美国一块留学，现在是北京师范大学历史系的讲师。邬沧萍申请下放进行劳动锻炼的时候，李雅书多方面给予鼓励，并且送给他一本第三期“红旗飘飘”杂志，让他如果遇到困难，就看看革命前辈英勇奋斗的故事。李雅书对记者说：“邬沧萍下去劳动才两个多月，变化可不小。过去，他在家里遇到劳动人民，不大理会。现在可不同啦，有一次，小孩保姆朱少霞的丈夫，是个农民，从乡下到我们家来，邬沧萍热情招待，两个人谈农业生产和农民生活，越谈越有劲。这是从前少有的情况。又有一次，星期日，我们一家到弟弟家里作客，吃完饭以后保姆出去有事，邬沧萍一个人跑到厨房里去洗碗，后来我们发现了，大家一窝蜂地都去参加了洗碗的劳作。（附图片）
