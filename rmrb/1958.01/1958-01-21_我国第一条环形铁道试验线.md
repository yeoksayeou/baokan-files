    China's First Circular Railway Test Line
    (Reported by this newspaper) China's first large-scale circular railway test line has been completed in the Nanga and Dongba areas of the eastern suburbs of Beijing.
    This circular railway test line is seventeen kilometers long, including a large loop and six intra-loop lines of different radii... . Its roadbed is wide, the ballast is thick, and below the ballast there are about twenty to thirty centimeters of sand, capable of withstanding various locomotives and vehicles of different weights and speeds running on it.
    The circular railway test line is designed according to the Soviet circular railway. It will have new technical equipment to be used by railway scientific institutions for testing and research. Here, the performance of various locomotives can be assessed, and many railway-related scientific and technological studies can be conducted. For example: the efficiency of steam locomotives, internal combustion locomotives, electric locomotives, etc.; the function and lifespan of various parts; the interaction between locomotives, vehicles, and lines; research on the structural integrity of track construction and track strength, etc. (Yan Qing)

    我国第一条环形铁道试验线
    本报讯　我国第一条规模宏大的环形铁道试验线，已经在北京东郊区南皋、东坝一带建成。
    这条环形铁道试验线路长达十七公里，包括大环线和六种不同半径的环内线……。它的路基宽，石碴厚，石碴下边有二十至三十公分左右的砂子，能够经得住各种不同重量和不同速度的机车、车辆在上面行驶。
    环形铁道试验线是根据苏联的环形铁道设计的，它将具备新的技术装备，供给铁道科学机构作试验和研究用。在这里能鉴定各种各样的机车的性能，作很多铁道方面的科学技术研究。例如：蒸汽机车、内燃机车、电气机车等的效率；各个零件的功能、寿命。机车、车辆和线路间的相互作用；线路上建筑结构和线路强度等的研究。		（延清）
