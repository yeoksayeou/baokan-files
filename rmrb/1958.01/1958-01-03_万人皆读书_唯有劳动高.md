Everyone Studies, But Labor is Supreme
    Qian Qichen
    Having lived in the Soviet Union for several years, one thing I deeply feel is the attitude and view towards labor, especially manual labor. The attitude and view towards labor mentioned here refers to the social ethos of the Soviet people and youth generally being diligent and loving labor.
    This is very clear among the educated youth. During the summer vacation, in many university dormitories, you can see announcements from nearby construction sites recruiting temporary workers. University students put down their books, put on coarse clothes, and start doing "rough work" like carrying bricks and tiles, pushing earth, and digging mud. Some go to stations and docks to work as temporary loaders and unloaders for a month. It is even more common for university students to go to wasteland or farms every year to participate in labor and help with harvesting, and it has become an integral part of ideological education for young people in Soviet universities. They receive certain remuneration for participating in manual labor, which is used as a supplement to their study and life.
    It is common to meet girls whose families are well-off, but they are willing to use the money they earn from their labor to sew a beautiful "blouse." There are also young people who, in order to give their loved ones a more precious gift on their birthday, go to work themselves and are unwilling to ask their families for money.
    The root of this is that people's ideological understanding has changed. Socialism has opened the doors of schools, allowing everyone to be educated.
    The seven-year universal education system has been implemented in Soviet rural areas, and the ten-year universal education system has been implemented in central cities. This means that every resident, regardless of their work or labor, must have a cultural level equivalent to that of a junior high school and high school graduate in our country. As a result, ordinary workers, farmers, and even cleaning ladies can appreciate Tchaikovsky's music, Repin's paintings, and classical and modern literary and artistic works.
    In the Soviet Union, it is "Everyone studies, but labor is supreme." Reading in the newspaper that a upsurge of going to labor for training has been set off in China, cadres are being sent to lower levels, and educated youths are determined to become the first generation of cultured workers and farmers, the entire social ethos will be like that of the Soviet Union. This is truly a great revolutionary movement of changing customs and habits that is gratifying.

### 万人皆读书  唯有劳动高

    万人皆读书  唯有劳动高
    钱其琛
    在苏联生活了几年，有一点感受得很深，那就是人们对待劳动，特别是体力劳动的态度和看法。这里所说对待劳动的态度和看法，是指苏联人民和青年一般都是勤勤恳恳，热爱劳动的社会风尚。
    这一点在知识青年中间看得很清楚。暑假的时候，在许多大学的宿舍里可以看到附近建筑工地招募临时小工的布告。大学生们放下书本，穿上粗布衣，就干起抬砖搬瓦，推土挖泥的“粗活”来。有的到车站、码头上去做临时的装卸搬运工，一干一个月。大学生们每年到荒地或农庄去参加劳动，帮助收割，那更是普遍极了，并且已经成为苏联高等学校中对青年进行思想教育的组成部分之一。他们参加体力劳动有一定的报酬，就作为自己学习生活的贴补。
    常可以遇见这样的姑娘，家里生活很好，但她却愿意用自己劳动所得的报酬来缝制一件漂亮的“布拉吉”。也有这样的青年，为了给自己的爱人在过生日时送比较珍贵的礼物，而自己去劳动，不愿向家里伸手。
    所以这样，归根结蒂，是由于人们的思想认识变了。社会主义打开了学校的大门，让每个人都能受教育。
    在苏联农村中实行了七年制普及教育，中心城市里是十年制普及教育，这就是说，每个居民，不管从事什么工作或劳动的，都要具有相当于我国的初中和高中毕业的文化程度。于是，普通的工人、农民，甚至是打扫房间的女工，都有可能欣赏柴柯夫斯基的音乐，列宾的油画，古典和现代的文艺作品。
    在苏联是“万人皆读书，唯有劳动高”。从报上看到国内已掀起了到劳动中去锻炼的热潮，干部下放，知识青年立志成为第一代有文化的工人和农民，整个社会风尚也会像苏联一样。这真是一个令人可喜的移风易俗的伟大革命运动。
