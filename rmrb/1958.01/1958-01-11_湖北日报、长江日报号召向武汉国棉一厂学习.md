Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 10th: Hubei Daily and Yangtze Daily both published editorials on the 9th, calling on enterprises throughout the province to learn from the experience of the State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in organizing workers to visit and study in rural areas, to further boost the revolutionary enthusiasm of workers and launch a new upsurge in production.

Hubei Daily's editorial stated that this experience is a new development in the methods of political work in enterprises, and it is a good experience worthy of universal promotion in all enterprises throughout the province. Learning and promoting this experience will powerfully promote the arrival of a new upsurge in production on a provincial scale, and make the province's industrial production leap forward. The editorial said: At present, agricultural production is in the midst of a great leap forward, and agriculture is making many new demands on industry. If we live in the city, sit in the office, and do not go to the countryside to investigate and understand, we cannot accurately understand the needs of agriculture. If we do not understand the needs of agriculture, how can we support agriculture well? Going to the countryside regularly to visit and study is a good way to understand the needs of agriculture and support agriculture well.

The editorial pointed out that going to the countryside to visit and study is an effective way to educate the working class in the spirit of being masters of their own affairs; it is a good way to help leading cadres overcome the three bad styles, improve leadership methods, and improve leadership skills.

The Yangtze Daily pointed out in an editorial entitled "Learn from Each Other, Leap Forward Together" that many workers in Wuhan's industrial departments have not yet clearly seen, and therefore have not been fully ideologically and organizationally prepared to meet the current new situation. This is a prominent manifestation of people's thinking lagging behind objective reality in the current rapidly developing upsurge of socialist revolution. Stepping out of the small circle of a factory, broadening one's horizons, looking at advanced factories, especially looking at the new face of the countryside, has a significant effect on overcoming ideological backwardness and realizing a great leap forward in thinking. The editorial said: The experience of the No. 1 Cotton Mill proves that visiting the countryside is a very good way to promote in-depth rectification and socialist education at present. It is vivid and effective, and can solve ideological problems that require a lot of time to debate in a relatively short period of time, such as the leadership responsibility of the working class, the relationship between workers and peasants (mainly the living standards of workers and peasants), the relationship between production and life, etc.

    湖北日报、长江日报号召向武汉国棉一厂学习
    据新华社武汉10日电　湖北日报和长江日报都在9日发表社论，号召全省企业，学习国营武汉第一棉纺织厂组织职工到农村参观学习，进一步鼓起职工的革命干劲，掀起生产新高潮的经验。
    湖北日报的社论说，这个经验是企业政治工作方法的新发展，是值得全省各企业普遍推广的好经验。学习和推广这一经验，将有力地促进全省规模的生产新高潮的到来，使全省的工业生产跃进一步。社论说：目前，农业生产正在大跃进中，农业向工业提出了许多新的要求。我们住在城市，坐在办公室里，不到农村去调查了解，就不能确切地了解农业的需要，不了解农业的需要，又怎么能支援好农业呢？定期到农村去参观学习，就是了解农业需要，支援好农业的一个好办法。
    社论指出，到农村去参观学习，是向工人阶级进行主人翁思想教育的一个有效办法；是帮助领导干部克服三个坏主义，改善领导方法，提高领导水平的一个好办法。
    长江日报在题为“互相学习，共同跃进”的社论中指出，在武汉市各工业部门的职工中，很多人还没有清楚地看到，因而还没有充分的思想准备和组织准备去迎接当前的新形势。这是当前迅速发展的社会主义革命高潮中，人们的思想落后于客观实际的一个突出表现。跳出一个工厂的小圈子，把眼界扩大一下，看看先进工厂，特别是看看农村的新面貌，对于克服思想上的落后和实现思想上的大跃进，有重大作用。社论说：国棉一厂的经验证明：参观农村，是当前推动深入整改、深入进行社会主义教育的一种很好的方式。它生动、有效，可以用较短的时间解决需要许多时间来辩论的思想问题，例如工人阶级的领导责任问题，工农关系（主要是工农生活水平）问题；生产与生活的关系问题等。
