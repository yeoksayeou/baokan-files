Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th January - The British "World News" reported today that the heads of government of India, Ceylon, and Rhodesia all support an early East-West conference.

The newspaper asked government leaders around the world for their opinions on the suggestion to hold an East-West conference as soon as possible. India, Rhodesia, and Ceylon were the first three countries to reply to the newspaper.

The private secretary of the Indian Prime Minister replied: "Mr. Nehru is deeply convinced that any effective step leading to the elimination of the Cold War could contribute to security and bring a sigh of relief to millions of people in Asia, Europe, and America. Now is the psychologically significant moment when action is needed immediately. Letting this moment slip away would lead to great disappointment and bring more danger."

Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said: "I firmly support an East-West summit. I feel that the current international situation can hopefully obtain reasonably satisfactory results from such a meeting. I welcome Prime Minister Macmillan's recent statement on the possibility of signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union."

Rhodesia and Nyasaland Federal Prime Minister Welensky said: "I think an East-West summit should be held immediately. To begin the pursuit of peace, no high-level meeting is too high."

    印度、锡兰和罗得西亚三国总理
    支持尽早召开东西方会议
    新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：英国“世界新闻报”今天说，印度、锡兰和罗得西亚政府首脑都支持早日举行东西方会议。
    这家报纸请世界各国政府负责人对尽早举行东西方会议的建议发表意见，印度、罗得西亚和锡兰是最先答复该报的三个国家。
    印度总理的私人秘书回答说：“尼赫鲁先生深信，任何导致消除冷战的有效步骤都可以有助于安全并且给千千万万的亚洲、欧洲和美洲人民带来松一口气的感觉。现在正是需要马上采取行动的具有心理意义的时刻。如果听任这个时刻溜过去，那就会导致很大的失望和带来更多的危险。”
    锡兰总理班达拉奈克说：“我坚决支持东西方最高级会议。我觉得目前的国际局势可以有希望从这样的会议中获得合理地令人满意的结果。我欢迎麦克米伦首相最近发表的谈到同苏联签订互不侵犯条约的可能性的声明。”
    罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦总理韦伦斯基说：“我认为应当立即举行东西方最高级会议。为了着手追求和平，任何高级的会议都不嫌过高。”
