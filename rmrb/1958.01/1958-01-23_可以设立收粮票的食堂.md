    A Canteen That Accepts Grain Coupons Can Be Established
    Since December 1st of last year, the Grain Bureau of Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, has specifically designated a joint state-private restaurant in the county seat to supply meals and dishes in exchange for circulating grain coupons. Since the implementation of this method, it has achieved great results, and customers have expressed their convenience.

    The restaurant is open from 7:30 AM to 10:00 PM daily, and customers can eat whenever they arrive during this period. At the same time, grain coupons can be promptly collected. This greatly reduces the pressure on the supply of other non-staple foods. All staff members who have been to Yiwu believe this method is very good and can be promoted in other county towns.

    可以设立收粮票的食堂
    浙江义乌县粮食局从去年12月1日起，在县城里专门指定了一家公私合营饭店，采取凭流动粮票供应饭、菜的办法。这个办法实行以来，成绩很好，顾客莫不称便。
    这家饭店每天营业时间是上午七时半到晚上十时，在这段时间内，顾客可以随到随吃。同时可以及时收回粮票。这样就大大的减少了对其他副食品供应的压力。凡来过义乌的工作人员都认为这个办法很好，可以在其它县城推广。
