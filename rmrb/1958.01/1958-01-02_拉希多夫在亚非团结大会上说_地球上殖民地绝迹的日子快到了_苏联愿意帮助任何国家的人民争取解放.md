Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 31st - Rashidov, head of the Soviet delegation, said at the plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference this afternoon that the time has now come for the people of the East to become masters of their own destiny and to participate in deciding the destiny of all mankind. "No important international issue can be resolved today without the participation of the Asian and African people."

Rashidov pointed out that it is difficult to underestimate the importance of this conference. He said, "The unity of the Asian and African people is strengthening year by year. This unity will never be destroyed by any hostile forces." He said: "All honest people in the world support this meeting, support its spirit and propositions, because this meeting is anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and anti-war, and it is just, progressive and humane in nature."

Rashidov pointed out that the Soviet people fully agree with and support the growing strength and unity of the Asian and African countries. Now this force is playing a very important role in expanding the peace zone and in the struggle against the moribund, decadent and predatory imperialist system.

He then talked about the economic and cultural development of the Soviet Central Asian republics—Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and the Soviet Transcaucasian republics—Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia. He said that the economic and cultural development of these countries "completely refutes the slanderous fabrications of colonial theorists who imagine that the people of the East cannot develop and prosper independently."

Rashidov reiterated the Soviet Union's policy of peace. He said that the Soviet Union "has always been willing to help the people of any country in their liberation struggle, and after liberation, to help them strengthen their political and economic independence."

Rashidov then reaffirmed, "We do not attach any political, military or other conditions to our assistance, and we do not interfere in the internal affairs of the countries that receive our assistance. We have only one sentiment, one wish, and one purpose as a guide. This is peace and friendship between the people of all countries."

Speaking of the current international issues, Rashidov said that the Soviet Union demands an end to the colonial war in Algeria and demands a just solution to the problems of Taiwan, West Irian, Goa, Okinawa, and all other urgent issues concerning the national independence of Asian and African countries. He also supports the demand of the Arab people that Palestinian refugees should return to their homes and that they should be compensated for the damage they have suffered due to forced displacement.

Rashidov condemned the imperialist attempt to link the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He said that most Eastern countries are opposed to these conspiracies. He also pointed out that the Eisenhower Doctrine is "a tool to enslave the people of the East."

Rashidov concluded by saying that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference "marks a further unity and unification of the strength of the people of the East in the common struggle against colonialism and in the common struggle for the complete liberation of the people of the Asian and African countries from the political and economic rule of the imperialist countries. The Asian and African people who have already achieved independence will neither be deceived nor intimidated or enslaved. Their will to fight for freedom and peace is unbreakable."

He said, "The day is not far away when there will be no colonies and dependent countries on the earth; the banner of friendship of the people and the banner of freedom, progress and creative peaceful labor will fly victoriously all over the world."

    拉希多夫在亚非团结大会上说
    地球上殖民地绝迹的日子快到了
    苏联愿意帮助任何国家的人民争取解放
    据新华社开罗12月31日电　苏联代表团团长拉希多夫今天下午在亚非团结大会全体会议上说，东方各国人民成为他们自己命运的主人和参加决定全人类命运的时候，现在到来了。“如果没有亚非人民参加，今天没有一个重要的国际问题能够得到解决”。
    拉希多夫指出，要想低估这次大会的重要性是很困难的。他说，“亚非各国人民的团结正在逐年加强。这种团结决不会被任何敌对力量所破坏”。他说：“全世界所有正直的人都支持这次会议，支持它的精神和主张，因为这次会议是反帝国主义、反殖民主义和反战争的，它在性质上是正义的、进步的和人道的”。
    拉希多夫指出，苏联人民完全赞成和支持亚非国家力量的日益增长和团结。现在这种力量在扩大和平地区以及同苟延残喘的、腐朽的、掠夺性的帝国主义制度进行斗争时起着很重要的作用。
    他接着谈到苏联中亚细亚各共和国——乌兹别克、塔吉克、土库曼、吉尔吉斯、哈萨克，以及苏联外高加索各共和国——阿塞拜疆、格鲁吉亚和亚美尼亚的经济和文化发展情况。他说，这些国家的经济和文化发展，“完全驳斥了殖民主义理论家想像出来的关于所谓东方人民不能独立地发展和繁荣的诽谤性捏造”。
    拉希多夫重申了苏联的和平政策。他说，苏联“一直愿意帮助任何国家的人民进行解放斗争，以及在获得解放后，帮助他们加强政治独立和经济独立”。
    拉希多夫接着再次申明，“我们不在我们的援助上附有任何政治、军事或其他条件，我们不干涉得到我们援助的国家的内政。我们只有一个情绪、一个愿望、一个目的作为指南。这就是各国人民之间的和平和友谊。”
    拉希多夫在谈到目前的国际问题时说，苏联要求结束阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，并且要求公正地解决台湾、西伊里安、果阿、冲绳岛等问题，以及其他一切关于亚非国家的民族独立的迫切问题。他还支持阿拉伯各国人民的这个要求：巴勒斯坦的难民应该回到他们的家乡，他们应该得到他们由于被迫迁移而受到损害的赔偿金。
    拉希多夫谴责帝国主义企图把东南亚条约组织、巴格达条约和北大西洋公约组织及“艾森豪威尔主义”联系起来的阴谋。他说，大多数东方国家是反对这些阴谋诡计的。他并且指出，艾森豪威尔主义是“奴役东方人民的工具”。
    拉希多夫最后说，亚非团结大会“标志着东方各国人民的力量在反对殖民主义的共同斗争中，以及在争取亚非各国人民从帝国主义国家的政治和经济统治下获得完全解放的共同斗争中的进一步团结和统一。已经取得了独立的亚非各国人民既不会受骗，也不会被吓倒和被奴役。它们争取自由和和平的意志是牢不可破的。”
    他说，“现在离开这样的一天已经不太远了，那就是：地球上将没有殖民地和附属国；人民友谊的旗帜以及自由、进步和创造性的和平劳动的旗帜，将在全世界胜利地飘扬。”
