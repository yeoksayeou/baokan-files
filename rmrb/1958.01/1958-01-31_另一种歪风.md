Another Unhealthy Trend

Wang Fan, Railway Worker, Matou Station, Beijing-Guangzhou Line

To beautify the station, last summer the station specially bought dozens of small goldfish, kept in a large tank on the platform. The colorful little goldfish swimming around in the tank looked very cute. The passenger service comrades changed the water and fed them every day, protecting them like treasures. After a few days, suddenly a dozen or so were missing. This was strange. Such small fish, kept in such deep water, couldn't be eaten by cats, and besides, there were no cats at the station at all. So where did these fish go? Someone said they must have flown away. It is said that on foggy nights, fish can fly away on the moist air. Since no other reason could be found for a while, we had to believe this comrade. Besides, maybe goldfish really can fly away; they do have very large wings.

In order to prevent the fish from flying away again, the service comrades painstakingly twisted a dense cover out of thin wire to cover the tank, but they continued to "fly away" constantly, until a way was found to lock the lid onto the tank, and then they stopped disappearing. At the same time, the flowers on the platform, even with their heavy pots, also kept "flying away" together.

Later, it was discovered that these goldfish and flowers had flown to the homes of certain people.

In fact, it's not just flowers and fish. Our station's staff canteen, which is a very small canteen, still loses more than a hundred pieces of tableware every month. According to the person in charge of the canteen, some people spend five cents to buy a dish but take away a plate worth thirty or forty cents, spend two cents to buy a soup, but take away a bowl worth twenty or thirty cents. Some people take them to their own homes, and some people throw them away casually after eating, thinking that they don't spend any money anyway. So, in the dormitories, in the offices, there are canteen plates and bowls everywhere, and some even "go on business trips" with the train attendants to Anyang and Handan, dozens of miles away.

Among our workers, there are still some people like this now, whose old ideas are more serious, and who cannot distinguish the relationship between the collective and the individual from the old "public" and "private." In the past, because of the pressure of life, stealing "public" property often became a habit, so now they secretly take public property without feeling ashamed. This is an unhealthy bad habit that is incompatible with the socialist system. This kind of atmosphere should also be rectified in the rectification movement. I believe that the great fire of the rectification movement should not only burn away the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership, burn away all waste, but also burn away all bad habits that damage the public interest.

    另一种歪风
    京广线马头车站铁路工人　王凡
    为了美化站容，去年夏天站上特意买回来几十条小金鱼，养在站台上的一个大缸里，五颜六色的小金鱼在缸里游来游去，看着很可爱，客运服务员同志，每天换水喂食，像宝贝一样的护佑它。几天之后，忽然发现少了十几条，这就奇怪了，这样小的鱼又放在这样深的水里，猫是吃不了的，况且车站根本就没猫，那么这些鱼到那里去了呢？有人说一定是飞走了，据说在大雾的夜里，鱼是能够趁着潮湿的空气飞走的。既然一时找不到别的原因，于是只好相信这个同志的话，再说金鱼也许真会飞走吧，它确实长着很大的翅。
    为了不让鱼再飞走，服务员同志还煞费苦心地用细铁丝拧了一个密密的罩子，把缸给罩起来，但还是不断的要“飞走”，直等后来设法把盖锁到缸上，才不再丢了。与此同时，站台上的花，而且还带着那样沉重的花盆也不断的一齐“飞走”。
    后来才发现这些金鱼和花是飞到某些人的家里去了。
    其实不只花和鱼是这样，我们车站职工食堂，本来是个很小的食堂，但是食堂的碗盘等物，每月都要丢失一百多件。据食堂的负责人说，有些人花五分钱买一个菜却端走一个价值三、四角的盘子，花二分钱买一个汤，却端走了一个价值二、三角的碗，有些人是端到自己家里去了，有些人吃了饭就随地乱扔，认为自己反正不花钱，于是在宿舍里，在办公室里，到处都是食堂里的盘碗，甚至还有些随着乘务员跑到几十里远的安阳、邯郸“出差”去了。
    在我们工人中，现在还有这样的一些人，他们的旧观点比较严重，弄不清集体同个人的关系已和过去的“公家”和“私人”有所不同。过去因为生活的逼迫，常常偷盗“公家”的财物成了习惯，所以现在偷偷摸摸地拿公物，也不觉得可耻。这是一种不健康的、与社会主义制度不相容的坏风气，在整风运动中也应将这种风气整一整，我认为，整风运动的大火，不但要烧去领导上的官僚主义、主观主义、烧掉一切浪费，而且也应当烧掉一切损害公共利益的不良习惯。
