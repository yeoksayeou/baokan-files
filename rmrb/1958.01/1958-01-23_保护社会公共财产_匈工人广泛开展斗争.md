Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 21st: According to "People's Freedom," a large-scale struggle, involving all strata of society, to protect social public property is unfolding in Hungary.

This struggle was initiated last week by workers at the Diósgyőr Lenin Iron and Steel Works, one of Hungary's largest steel mills. The workers of this factory called on workers across the country to promote the working class's traditional spirit of discipline and, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, resolutely oppose theft, fraud, and waste of state property. So far, this call has been echoed by staff at the Csepel Iron and Steel Works, Ikarus Bus Factory, Ganz Locomotive and Wagon Works, Old Buda Shipyard, Ganz Electrical Works, Gamma Optical Works and other industrial enterprises, and has aroused the attention and discussion of workers in factories, state-owned farms, and production cooperative members in various states.

"People's Freedom" published an editorial today, believing that the call from the Lenin Iron and Steel Works is of great significance. The editorial pointed out that in the past, the amount of damage to social property exposed by state organs each year was nearly 200 million forints, and the amount not exposed was far more than that. What a huge loss for the working people! The reason for this phenomenon is that some staff members have been influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes and have embarked on the path of theft and deception; the lack of supervision and the irresponsible laissez-faire and lack of resolute struggle against these phenomena are also the reasons why these phenomena can exist.

The editorial pointed out that the struggle to protect social property should not be simply against theft, but should strictly practice economy, strengthen labor discipline and wage management, oppose the creation of waste products, oppose lowering quotas, and oppose waste. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen vigilance and inspection systems, so as to establish a new order in every factory, cooperative, and state-owned farm.

### 保护社会公共财产  匈工人广泛开展斗争

    保护社会公共财产
    匈工人广泛开展斗争
    新华社布达佩斯21日电　据“人民自由报”报道：匈牙利国内正在展开了一个规模巨大的、包括社会各阶层的保护社会公共财产的斗争。
    这个斗争是由匈牙利最大的炼钢厂之一——迪奥日吉厄尔列宁钢铁厂的工人在上星期发起的。这个工厂的工人号召全国工人发扬工人阶级遵守纪律的传统精神，并且在社会主义工人党的领导下坚决反对盗窃、舞弊和浪费国家财产的现象。截至目前为止，这个号召已经得到了切佩尔钢铁厂、伊卡鲁斯汽车工厂、甘兹机车车辆厂、旧布达造船厂、甘兹电气厂、加马化学仪器厂等工业企业的工作人员的响应，而且引起了各州的工厂、国营农场的工人和生产合作社社员的注意和讨论。
    “人民自由报”今天发表社论，认为列宁钢铁厂这一号召具有很重大的意义。社论指出，过去每年由国家机关揭发出来的损害社会财产的数目都将近两亿福林，而未被揭发出来的还远不只这个数目。这是劳动人民的多么巨大的损失。造成这种现象的原因是有些工作人员受了剥削阶级思想的影响，走上了偷盗、欺骗的道路；而缺乏监督、对这些现象采取不负责任的放任不管和不进行坚决斗争的态度，也是使这些现象能够存在的原因。
    社论指出，保护社会财产的斗争不应当只是单纯地反对偷盗，而应当严格节约、加强劳动纪律和工资管理，反对造成废品、反对降低定额、反对浪费等。另一方面，还要加强警惕和检查制度，这样才能在每个工厂、合作社和国营农场内建立起新的秩序。
