A Comparison of Soviet and American Economic Development
Zhang Zhenya

In his speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said, "Our planning staff's calculations show that in terms of the production of various most important products, the Soviet state will not only catch up with but also surpass the current United States within the next fifteen years."

In Washington, American commentator Edson uneasily pointed out that the Soviet Union is approaching the scale of the United States in the production of means of production, equipment for power station enterprises and heavy machinery, and the amount of steel used. "Chicago Daily News" Washington correspondent Edwin Leahy said that Russia, which was one of the most backward countries in Europe two generations ago, is now the second strongest power in the world. The Soviet Union's industrial growth rate is much faster than that of the United States. Major American newspapers and periodicals such as "The New York Times," "Time" magazine, "Business Week," and "U.S. News & World Report" have also expressed unease about the scale of Soviet industrial development.

            Historical Review

Before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia was a very backward country in terms of both industrial and agricultural production. Compared with the United States at that time, which had implemented large-scale modern production in both industry and agriculture and whose power generation had jumped to the first place in the world, there was no comparison. In terms of industrial production, in 1913, Russia's steel was only one-seventh of that of the United States, coke was only one-tenth of that of the United States, electricity was only one-thirteenth of that of the United States, and coal mining was only one-sixteenth of that of the United States... The per capita industrial output was almost one-thirteenth to one-fourteenth of that of the United States. In terms of agriculture, the United States already had 1,000 tractors nationwide in 1910, and this number increased sharply to nearly 250,000 in 1920. However, before the October Revolution, Russia mainly used primitive tools such as wooden plows and iron plows in agriculture. In 1920, under the destruction of the war, the Soviet Union's agricultural output was even only half of that in 1913.

However, in just forty years, the Soviet Union has not only greatly shortened the distance with the United States in industrial and agricultural production, but has also surpassed the United States in some products.

Currently, the Soviet Union's wool, potatoes, and sugar beets have exceeded the United States in both total output and per capita output; the total output of wheat, timber harvesting, and sugar has also exceeded the United States. Four Union Republics, including Ukraine and Lithuania, have already exceeded or are in the process of exceeding the United States in per capita livestock product output. The Moldavian Republic has surpassed the United States in the production of a series of agricultural products, especially vegetable and animal oils, vegetables, and wool. The Soviet Union's coal and iron ore mining volume is approaching the figures of the United States, steel production has reached one-half of that of the United States, and the electricity consumption per worker in industry is equivalent to one-third of that of each worker in the United States, and cement production has increased from only one-ninth of that of the United States in 1913 to one-half at present. In terms of per capita industrial output, the ratio of the Soviet Union to the United States has also narrowed from 1:13 to 1:14 in 1913 to 1:2.6 in 1957.

If we review the unfavorable environment in which the Soviet Union achieved this achievement, it will be even more helpful to explain the problem.

In 1917, under the dual impact of World War I and domestic revolutionary turmoil, the Soviet Union's industrial production decreased by 29% compared with 1913. Then came the imperialist armed intervention from 1918 to 1920, which further reduced the Soviet Union's industrial production to one-seventh of that in 1913 and agricultural production to one-half of that in 1913. It was not until 1928 that the Soviet Union completed the restoration of the national economy with incomparable difficulties.

Thirteen years later, Hitler's Germany's attack interrupted the Soviet Union's peaceful construction work again. During the war, 1,710 towns and cities were destroyed and burned by the Soviet Union, 31,850 factories were destroyed, and the national economic loss reached 2,569 billion rubles. In 1944, the Soviet Union's steel production fell to about one-tenth of that of the United States.

Thus, apart from the domestic war from 1918 to 1920, the fascist German attack from 1941 to 1945, and the restoration work from 1921 to 1928 and 1945 to 1948, the Soviet Union actually only had less than twenty-two years to engage in construction.

But during this time, the United States not only was not ravaged by war, but both world wars greatly revitalized its already stagnant industry. Especially during World War II, its industrial productivity increased by 50%, steel production increased by 17%, and the smelting capacity of aluminum (the main raw material for manufacturing aircraft) even increased by more than 200%.

However, despite this, the Soviet Union's socialist industry, with its unparalleled superiority over the capitalist system, overcame numerous difficulties and greatly surpassed the United States in terms of development speed.

      Comparison of Industrial Development Speed

The industrial development speed of the Soviet Union and the United States has differed greatly over the past forty-four years.

As of 1956, the Soviet Union's industrial output had increased by more than approximately 29 times compared to 1913, while the United States had only increased by more than three times. If 1957 is also included, the Soviet Union's industry has actually increased by 32 times compared to 1913. However, the United States' industrial production for the entire year of 1957 still remained at the level of 1956.

If we take the development speed of some important industrial products, this disparity is particularly prominent. For example, the Soviet Union's coal mining volume increased nearly twelve times from 1913 to 1956, while the United States decreased by 7%; the Soviet Union's steel production increased by ten and a half times during the same period, while the United States only increased by more than two times; the Soviet Union's electricity production increased nearly 98 times, while the United States increased by less than 27 times.

The occurrence of this situation is inseparable from the Soviet Union's socialist economy forging ahead, while the United States' capitalist economy is constantly troubled by crises.

From 1918 to 1929 was the most difficult period in the Soviet Union's socialist economic construction. In addition to the destruction of the war, the shortage of funds and the weakness of technical forces seriously affected the Soviet state's economic progress. But even during this period, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industry was 6.9%, while the speed of the United States was only 3%.

Although the United States greatly developed its industry and agriculture from the World War from 1914 to 1917, a crisis of surplus production appeared in the United States as soon as the war stopped. In 1921, when the Soviet Union was turning to the restoration of the national economy, the United States' industry was hit by a crisis, and production fell by nearly 20%, and steel production fell by 53%. It was not until 1923 that it recovered to the level of 1919.

In 1928, the Soviet Union got rid of the difficult environment of the early days of the founding of the country and began the construction of the first five-year plan. From 1930 to 1940, before the Second World War, the Soviet Union's industrial advancement at a large stride left the American industry even further behind in speed. In these eleven years, the Soviet Union's industry increased by an average of 16.5% per year, while the United States only increased by an average of 1.2% per year. The total crisis of the capitalist economy in October 1929 broke out on the eve of this period. This crisis caused the United States' industrial production to fall by 54% in the next four years, steel production fell by 76%, pig iron production fell by 79%, coal mining fell by 41%, and industrial production gradually recovered until 1936, while the production of durable industrial products did not rebound to the level of 1929 until August 1940, one year after the outbreak of World War II.

In the eleven years after the Second World War, due to the needs of postwar European reconstruction, the delayed needs of the American people during the war, and the needs of the capitalist world to update fixed capital, the American economy experienced a period of "prosperity." But despite this, the average annual increase in Soviet industrial production after the war was 15.9%, while the average annual increase in American industry was only 4.7%. The difference in the growth rate of steel, coal, and electricity production between the Soviet Union and the United States after the war was particularly huge.

In 1957, the Soviet Union's steel production increased by about 2.8 times compared with 1946, but the United States' steel production did not even increase by one time (the United States' steel production in 1957 is expected to be not much different from 1956). At the same time, the United States' coal production not only did not rise but also showed a downward trend.

In addition, in contrast to the continuous development of Soviet industrial production, the American economy experienced three more declines in 1949, 1953-1954, and 1957.

From October 1948 to July 1949, due to the surplus production of consumer goods and spreading to machine manufacturing, smelting, and mining industries, the United States' production fell by 18.3%. Later, the United States relied on the implementation of the Marshall Plan, especially the war boom caused by the Korean War in 1950, to escape from this decline.

In 1953-1954, the surplus production of consumer goods and a slight reduction in military spending caused the United States to fall into another industrial decline crisis. Later, only by relying on the expansion of credit by the US federal government, increasing government spending, reducing corporate taxes, and the absorption of American industrial products by the economic rise of Western European countries at that time, did this decline not develop into a serious economic crisis.

But in 1957, the United States' industrial production declined again. The industrial production index fell from 147 in December 1956 (100 in 1947-1949) to 139 in November last year. Currently, this decline is still developing.

From the above situation, it can be seen that when the Soviet socialist society, which has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of productive forces, is advancing by leaps and bounds, the American capitalist society, which has become a shackle on productive forces, has to be busy dealing with the problem of its surplus productive forces. And with the rapid development of science and technology in the future, the conflict between American productive forces and production relations will only become more acute.

        Comparison of Technical Potential

Another important factor contributing to the Soviet Union's economic advantage over the United States is the strength of the Soviet Union's scientific and technological forces. According to estimates by the US Central Intelligence Agency, the current number of scientists in the United States is 1.3 million, while the Soviet Union has 1.5 million. The number of engineers in the United States is 400,000, while the Soviet Union has 721,000. According to a report by the Patman Economic Stabilization Subcommittee of the US Congress, as early as 1945, the total number of Soviet scientists and engineers was slightly higher than that of the United States. This committee made the following statistics on the number of engineers who graduated from schools in the Soviet Union and the United States in the three years from 1954 to 1956:

                  United States  Soviet Union
      1954          22,000          53,000
      1955          23,000          63,000
      1956          26,000          71,000

In addition, in terms of the number of industrial workers, the United States had 13,725,000 industrial workers in 1956, while the Soviet Union had 15,180,000.

From this simple comparison, it can be seen that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in scientific and technological strength. At the same time, since the Soviet Union's annual increase in scientists and engineers is equal to two to three times that of the United States, then the comparison of scientific and technological strength between the Soviet Union and the United States in fifteen years will obviously undergo changes that are more unfavorable to the United States. No wonder that as early as February 15 last year, the famous physics professor Edward Teller, who is known as the "father of the hydrogen bomb" in the United States, said: In the next ten years, the world's best scientists will come from the Soviet Union. After the two artificial Earth satellites of the Soviet Union went into the sky, no one can doubt that the Soviet Union's scientific and technological strength is far ahead of the United States in terms of both quality and quantity.

          Comparison of Resources

The vast Soviet Union has abundant mineral resources, which has enabled the Soviet Union to build its own modern industry in the past forty years without relying on foreign raw material supplies. In recent years, Soviet geologists have discovered rich oil deposits between the Urals and the Volga River, and discovered tin, molybdenum, and iron mines in Siberia... New coalfields have been discovered in Ukraine, rich iron mines have been discovered in Kursk, and various non-ferrous metals and rare metals have been discovered in Kazakhstan and Central Asia... All of this has made the Soviet Union rank first in the world in terms of the reserves of iron, manganese, coal, copper, bauxite, nickel, tungsten, lead, zinc... and other mineral raw materials. The reserves of coal account for 57% of the world's known reserves, and the reserves of manganese account for 88% of the world's known reserves. Its iron ore reserves account for 41% of the world's reserves, more than twice the total of the known reserves of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany. Oil reserves also rank among the world's best.

But the United States, which has always been known for its abundant resources, has seen depletion in recent years due to the monopoly capital's abuse of national resources and wasteful use. The rich ore of the American Lake Superior iron ore region, which once supplied 85% of the country's iron ore, is no longer sufficient to meet the needs. At present, the United States imports 10% of its iron ore consumption from Chile, Venezuela, Liberia, and Labrador. Although the United States still ranks first in the world in oil production, since the 1920s, the depletion of oil deposits has become a concern for Washington. Although new oil deposits have been continuously discovered in Alaska and the Rocky Mountains in recent years, the rate of discovery of new oil deposits in the United States lags far behind other oil-producing regions. At the same time, due to huge consumption, it needs to import one-tenth of its oil every year. The maximum depth of oil well drilling has increased from 3,000 feet in 1900 to more than 20,000 feet in 1950. Those speculators who abuse oil well exploitation can only find oil in one well out of an average of twenty-five wells. As for other raw materials, according to a survey report by the Raw Materials Policy Committee of the Truman government in 1952, the United States will increasingly lack raw materials in the next generation, and it will need to import five-sixths of its natural rubber, 50% of its tin, as well as antimony, graphite, cobalt, manganese, asbestos, nickel, chromium, diamonds... from underdeveloped countries. Therefore, recently, "The New York Times" said when talking about the resources of the United States: "In this half century, the United States has changed from a country with abundant natural resources to a country lacking natural resources," so this newspaper suggested: "Go to develop and expand those extremely important foreign resources." But whether the people of the colonial countries who have stood up will still allow American big monopoly capital to plunder their resources in the future is a big question.

From the above situation, it can be seen that, whether from the speed of industrial development, the strength of technology, or the situation of national resources, the American economy is in a state of decline and powerlessness to move forward. Therefore, just as Comrade Khrushchev said, the Soviet Union's plan to catch up with the United States in fifteen years "may be revised in practical life. The most likely thing is that the deadline for the implementation of the drafted plan may be shortened." That is to say, in less than fifteen years, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in the output of various most important products.

    苏美经济发展的对比
    张振亚
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在庆祝十月革命四十周年的讲话中曾说，“我们的计划工作人员的计算表明，在各种最重要的产品产量方面，苏维埃国家在今后十五年内不仅能赶上，并且能超过目前的美国。”
    在华盛顿，美国评论员埃德逊不安地指出，苏联在生产资料、电站企业设备和重型机器设备以及用钢量等方面都正在接近美国的规模。“芝加哥每日新闻”的驻华盛顿记者埃德温·累希说，俄国在两代以前是欧洲的一个最落后国家，现在苏联在实力方面已占居世界第二位。苏联工业增长速度比美国快得多。“纽约时报”、“时代”周刊、“商业周刊”和“美国新闻与世界报道”等美国重要报刊，对苏联工业的发展规模也表示了不安。
            历史的回顾
    十月革命前的沙皇俄国，是一个工农业生产都十分落后的国家，同当时工农业已实行大规模现代化生产、发电量已跃居世界第一的美国相比，是不可同日而语的。在工业生产方面，1913年俄国钢铁只有美国的七分之一，焦炭只有美国的十分之一，电力只有美国的十三分之一，煤的开采量只有美国的十六分之一……在按人口计算的工业产量上几乎等于美国的13到14分之一。在农业方面，美国早在1910年全国已有拖拉机一千台，1920年，更激增至近二十五万台。而十月革命前俄国农业中用的主要是木犁、铁犁等原始工具。1920年苏联在战争破坏下，农业产量甚至只有1913年的二分之一。
    但是在短短的四十年中，苏联在工农业生产上不仅大大缩短了同美国的距离，而且在一些产品上已超过了美国。
    目前苏联的羊毛、马铃薯和甜菜不论在总产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面都已超过了美国；小麦、木材采伐和糖的总产量也已超过美国。乌克兰、立陶宛等四个加盟共和国在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量上已经和正在超过美国。摩尔达维亚共和国在一系列农产品的生产，特别是植物油和动物油、蔬菜、羊毛等生产上已超过美国。苏联煤和铁矿砂的采掘量已接近美国的数字，钢的产量已达到美国的二分之一，工业中每个工人的用电量已相当于美国每个工人用电量的三分之一，水泥的产量由1913年仅为美国的九分之一达到目前的二分之一。在按人口计算的工业产量上，苏联同美国的比例也由1913年的一比十三到十四缩小到1957年的一比二点六。
    如果回顾一下苏联是在怎样的不利环境中取得这一成就，那就会更有助于问题的说明。
    1917年在第一次世界大战和国内革命动荡的双重影响下，苏联的工业生产比1913年下降了29％。接着就是1918—1920年的帝国主义武装干涉，使苏联的工业生产进一步下降为1913年的七分之一，农业生产下降为1913年的二分之一，直到1928年苏联才在无比的困难中完成了国民经济的恢复。
    十三年之后，希特勒德国的进攻又中断了苏联的和平建设工作。在战争期中，苏联被破坏和烧毁的城镇达一千七百一十座，被毁掉的工厂达三万一千八百五十所，国民经济的损失达二万五千六百九十亿卢布。1944年苏联的钢铁生产量下跌到大约只有美国的十分之一。
    这样，除去1918—1920年的国内战争、1941—1945年法西斯德国的进攻、1921—1928年和1945—1948年的恢复工作，苏联实际上只有不到二十二年的时间在从事建设。
    可是在这当儿，美国本土不仅没有受到战火蹂躏，而且两次大战都使它的已陷入停滞的工业大大活跃起来。特别是在第二次世界大战中，它的工业生产力增加了50％，钢的产量提高了17％，铝（制造飞机的主要原料）的冶炼能力甚至提高达200％以上。
    可是，尽管如此，苏联的社会主义工业仍能以它胜过资本主义制度的无比优越性，克服了重重困难，在发展速度上大大超过了美国。
      工业发展速度的比较
    苏联和美国四十四年来工业发展速度相差很大。
    截至1956年止，苏联工业产量比1913年增加了约二十九倍多，而美国仅增加了三倍多。如果把1957年也计算在内，苏联的工业实际上比1913年增加了三十二倍。而美国1957年全年的工业生产却仍然停在1956年的水平上。
    如果以一些重要工业品的发展速度来说，这种悬殊尤其突出。例如苏联煤的开采量从1913到1956年增加近十二倍，而美国却下跌了7％；苏联钢的产量在同时期增加了十点五倍，而美国只增加了两倍多；电力生产苏联增加近九十八倍，而美国增加不到二十七倍。
    这种情况的发生是同苏联社会主义经济一往直前发展，美国资本主义经济却不断为危机所困扰分不开的。
    从1918到1929年是苏联社会主义经济建设中最困难的年代。除了战争的破坏以外，当时资金短绌、技术力量薄弱都曾严重地影响着苏维埃国家经济的前进。但是即使在这段时期，苏联工业的每年平均增长速度是6.9％，而美国的速度仅为3％。
    美国虽然从1914—1917年的世界大战中大大发展了它的工农业，但是战争一停，生产力过剩危机就在美国出现。1921年正当苏联转向国民经济恢复工作的时候，美国工业却在危机袭击下，生产量下跌了近20％，钢产量下跌了53％，直到1923年还没有恢复1919年的水平。
    1928年苏联摆脱了建国初期的艰苦环境，开始了第一个五年计划建设。从1930到1940年二次大战为止，苏联工业的大踏步前进在速度上把美国工业更加丢落在后面。在这十一年中，苏联工业每年平均增长16.5％，而美国每年平均只增加1.2％。1929年10月的资本主义经济总危机就是在这个时期的前夕爆发的。这次危机使美国工业生产在以后四年中下跌了54％，钢产量下降了76％，生铁产量下降了79％，煤的开采量下降了41％，工业生产直到1936年才逐渐恢复，而耐用工业品的产量则直到1940年8月第二次大战已爆发后一年才回升到1929年的水平。
    第二次世界大战后的十一年中，由于战后欧洲重建的需要、美国人民在战时推迟了的需求以及资本主义世界固定资本更新的需求，曾使美国经济出现过一段“繁荣”时期。但是尽管如此，战后苏联工业生产平均每年提高的速度是15.9％，而美国工业平均每年只提高4.7％。苏联和美国战后在钢、煤和电力生产上的增长速度的差异尤其巨大。
    1957年苏联钢产量比1946年增加了约2.8倍，但是美国的钢产量却连一倍都增加不到（1957年美国钢产量预料同1956年没有多大出入）。同时，美国的煤产量则不但没有上升反而呈现了下降的趋势。
    此外，和苏联工业生产一直向前发展的情况相反，美国经济在1949年、1953—1954年和1957年又发生了三次下降。
    从1948年10月到1949年7月，由于消费品生产过剩并波及到机器制造、冶炼和采掘工业，美国的生产曾下跌了18.3％。后来，美国借助于马歇尔计划的实施，特别是1950年朝鲜战争所引起的战争景气，才使它从这次下降中脱身出来。
    1953—1954年，消费品生产过剩和军费的稍许减缩又使美国再度陷入一次工业下降的危机中。后来只是依靠美国联邦政府扩充信贷、增加政府开支、减轻企业课税以及当时西欧各国经济上升对美国工业品的吸纳，才使这次下降没有发展为严重的经济危机。
    但是到1957年美国工业生产再次下降。工业生产指数从1956年12月的一百四十七（1947—1949年为100）下跌到去年11月的一百三十九。目前这种下跌仍在继续发展中。
    从上述情况中可以看出：为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔前途的苏联社会主义社会在飞跃前进的时候，已经成为生产力桎梏的美国资本主义社会却不得不忙于应付它的生产力过剩的问题。而随着今后科学技术的日新月异，美国生产力和生产关系的冲突只会更加尖锐起来。
        技术潜力的比较
    造成苏联经济对美国的优势的另一个重要的因素是苏联科学技术力量的强大。根据美国中央情报局的估计，目前美国科学家的人数是一百三十万人，而苏联是一百五十万人。美国工程师人数是四十万人，而苏联则有七十二万一千人。另据美国国会的派特门经济稳定小组委员会的报道，早在1945年时，苏联科学家和工程师的总数就已略高于美国。这个委员会曾就苏美两国1954—1956年三年中从学校毕业的工程师人数作了以下统计：
                  美国　苏联
      1954 22，000 53，000
      1955 23，000 63，000
      1956 26，000 71，000
    另外，从产业工人的人数来说，1956年美国有产业工人一千三百七十二万五千人，而苏联则有一千五百一十八万人。
    从这一简单比较就可以看出，苏联在科学技术力量上已超过美国。同时，由于苏联每年增加的科学家和工程师等于美国的二到三倍，那么，在十五年后苏美两国的科学技术力量的对比显然将发生更不利于美国的变化。难怪早在去年2月15日，美国的被称为“氢弹之父”的著名物理学教授爱德华·泰勒就说：今后十年，世界最好的科学家将出在苏联。在苏联的两颗人造地球卫星上天以后，苏联的科学技术力量无论在质上和量上都大大领先于美国，这就没有人可以怀疑了。
          资源的比较
    幅员辽阔的苏联拥有丰富的矿物蕴藏，这曾使苏联能够在过去四十年中不依赖国外原料供应建立起它自己的现代化工业。近年来苏联地质勘探人员更在乌拉尔和伏尔加河之间发现丰富的石油矿层，在西伯利亚发现锡矿、钼矿、铁矿……在乌克兰发现新煤田，在库尔斯克发现有丰富铁矿，在哈萨克和中亚细亚发现各种有色金属和稀有金属……所有这一切已经使苏联在铁、锰、煤、铜、铝土、镍、钨、铅、锌……等矿物原料的蕴藏量上占世界首位。煤炭的蕴藏量占世界已知蕴藏量的57％，锰的蕴藏量占世界已知蕴藏量的88％。它的铁矿砂蕴藏量占世界蕴藏量的41％，超过了美、英、法、西德四国已知蕴藏量的总和的两倍。石油蕴藏量也名列世界前茅。
    但是一向以资源丰富见称的美国，近年来却因垄断资本对国家资源的滥肆采掘和浪费使用出现了枯竭的现象。曾经供应全国85％的铁矿石的美国苏必利尔湖产铁区的富矿石已经不足应付需要。目前美国每年从智利、委内瑞拉、利比里亚和拉布拉多等地输入它所消费的10％的铁矿石。尽管在石油产量上美国仍占世界第一位，但是从二十年代起，石油矿层的枯竭就成为华盛顿所担心的问题。虽然近年来在阿拉斯加、落矶山区不断发现新的油藏，可是美国新油藏的发现速度，远远落后于其他产油地区。同时由于巨大的耗费，它每年需要进口十分之一的石油。油井钻探的最高深度已由1900年的三千英尺，增加到1950年的二万英尺以上。那些滥肆开采油井的投机商人平均每钻探二十五眼井才能碰到一眼井有石油。至于其他原料，根据1952年杜鲁门政府的原料政策委员会的调查报告，未来一个世代中美国的原料将日益缺乏，它所需用的六分之五的天然橡胶、50％的锡以及像锑、石墨、钴、锰、石绵、镍、铬、金刚石……等都需要从不发达国家输入。因此最近“纽约时报”在谈到美国的资源时说：“在这半个世纪里，美国从一个天然资源丰富的国家变成了一个缺乏天然资源的国家”，因而这家报纸建议：“去发展和扩大那些极为重要的外国资源。”但是已经站立起来的各殖民地国家人民今后是否仍会听任美国大垄断资本去掠夺他们的资源，这是很大一个疑问。
    从以上所述的情况中可以看出，无论是从工业发展的速度、技术力量和国家资源的情况来说，美国的经济都处于衰退和无力前进的状态中。因此，正像赫鲁晓夫同志所说，苏联十五年赶上美国的计划，“在实际生活中可能有所修正。最可能的是实现草拟的计划的期限可能缩短”。也就是说，在不到十五年中，苏联在各种最重要的产品产量上就会超过美国。
