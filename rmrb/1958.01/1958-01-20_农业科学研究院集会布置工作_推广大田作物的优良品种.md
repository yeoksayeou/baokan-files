Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences held its first National Field Crop Variety Conference in Beijing from the 8th to the 15th. The conference preliminarily studied the requirements for popularizing improved varieties before 1962 and arranged for the collection and preservation of farmer varieties of field crops.

In order to gradually meet the urgent need for improved varieties in the great leap forward of agricultural production in various regions, the conference believed that it is necessary to quickly organize forces starting this year to carry out local improved variety identification work (including the introduction of improved varieties from corresponding regions) in areas where improved varieties are not clear, especially in mountainous areas, border areas, arid areas, saline-alkali and low-lying areas, in a planned and focused manner for various major field crops. In areas where improved varieties already exist but have not been popularized, extensive comparative demonstrations should be conducted, small-scale variety comparisons and regional trials should be organized to determine the adaptation areas and cultivation conditions of improved varieties in order to expand their utilization. As for areas where improved varieties have been popularized or basically popularized, efforts should be made to update and replace them, and to supplement auxiliary varieties. Agricultural research institutions at all levels should formulate plans based on specific circumstances and determine the excellent varieties of major field crops suitable for various regions within three years.

According to statistics from the conference, as of now, 43 kinds of field crop farmer varieties have been collected in various parts of the country in the past three years, with nearly 210,000 materials. This illustrates the unparalleled richness of China's agricultural resources and the great achievements our ancestors have made in fighting against nature for thousands of years. The conference believes that this large and valuable heritage has become a basic material for tapping the potential of agricultural production increase and improving the quality of varieties in scientific research work. Therefore, preserving and sorting out these nearly 210,000 variety materials is an urgent and arduous task. In addition to providing these collected materials to local agricultural institutions for selecting and utilizing improved varieties, they must be preliminarily sorted out and suitable storage locations arranged to avoid accumulation, mildew, insect infestation, and rodent damage. In addition, there are approximately 12,000 copies of materials introduced from abroad scattered throughout the country, which are also of equal importance to our country's selection of improved varieties and research work to improve the quality of varieties, and should be given equal attention.

From this conference, it is understood that China has made remarkable achievements in promoting improved varieties of field crops in recent years. Including those evaluated by farmers, selected and bred by scientific institutions, and introduced from abroad, a total of 772 improved varieties of 18 crops, including rice, deep-water rice, upland rice, wheat, barley, oats, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potato, potato, soybean, peanut, rapeseed, sesame, sunflower, flax, and cotton, have been promoted nationwide, with a promotion area accounting for 55% of the total sown area. Rice varieties such as Nanthe No. 1, Jiefanggu, and Yinfang, wheat varieties such as Bima No. 1, Zaoyangmai, and Biyu Wheat, corn variety Fangza No. 2, sorghum variety Hongbangzi, sweet potato variety Huabei 117, potato varieties Wutaibai and Saibaiguo, soybean varieties Xiaojinhuang and Manchangjin, and Victory rapeseed have all been planted on more than one million mu, generally increasing production by 10%-30%.

    农业科学研究院集会布置工作
    推广大田作物的优良品种
    据新华社18日讯　中国农业科学研究院8日到15日在北京召开第一次全国大田作物品种会议，初步研究了1962年以前对普及良种的要求，安排了大田作物农家品种的收集和保存工作。
    为了逐步满足各地农业生产大跃进对于良种的迫切需要，会议认为必须从今年开始迅速组织力量，在良种不明确的地区，特别是山区、边区、干旱地区、盐碱和低洼等地区，有计划有重点地开展各种主要大田作物的地方良种鉴定工作（包括由相应地区引进良种的工作）；在已有良种但尚未普及的地区，要广泛进行对比示范，组织小型品种比较和区域试验，确定良种的适应地区和栽培条件，以便扩大利用。至于良种已经普及或基本普及的地区，要设法予以更新更换，并补充辅助品种。各级农业试验研究机构都要根据具体情况，制定规划，在三年内确定适合各地区的主要大田作物的优良品种。
    根据会议资料统计，到目前为止，全国各地在最近三年搜集到的大田作物农家品种有四十三种，材料近二十一万份。这说明了我国农业资源的无比丰富，说明了我们祖先数千年来向大自然作斗争所获得的伟大成就。会议认为，这一大宗宝贵遗产，已成为发挥农业增产潜力和在科学研究工作上改进提高品种质量的基本材料。因此，保存和整理这近二十一万份品种材料是急迫而艰巨的任务。这些搜集到的材料，除了供当地农业机构选择良种利用以外，必须加以初步整理，安排适宜保存的地点，以免积压霉烂、虫蛀、鼠咬而遭致损失。另外，分散在各地的国外引种的材料约有一万二千份，这对我国选择良种及改进提高品种的研究工作方面也有着同样重要的意义，应一并加以重视。
    从这次会议了解，我国这几年来在推广大田作物优良品种方面已经取得显著成绩。包括农家评选的、科学机关选育的及国外引种的，全国共已推广水稻、深水稻、陆稻、小麦、大麦、燕麦、玉米、高粱、粟、甘薯、马铃薯、大豆、花生、油菜、芝麻、向日葵、亚麻、棉花等十八种作物七百七十二个优良品种，推广面积已占全部播种面积55％。水稻如南特号、解放谷、银坊，小麦如碧蚂一号、早洋麦、碧玉麦，玉米坊杂二号，高粱红棒子，甘薯华北一一七，马铃薯五台白、赛白果，大豆小金黄、满仓金，胜利油菜等都有百万亩以上的种植面积，一般增产10％—30％。
