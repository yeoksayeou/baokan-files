Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th -- Washington dispatch: Just as the US Congress is investigating why the US is lagging behind the Soviet Union in artificial satellites and rockets, Lieutenant General James Gavin, Director of the US Army Research and Development Office, who is responsible for developing the "Jupiter" missile, suddenly announced on the 4th his decision to retire from the Army.
	Gavin, when testifying before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee recently, said that he and a considerable number of officers believed that the Soviet Union "has replaced the United States as the most advanced military power in the world," and he demanded that the United States completely reorganize the structure of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	American newspapers have reported that Gavin's testimony angered higher-level officials in the Department of Defense, who demanded that he retract his claims.
	Gavin said that after his retirement, he could "comment and discuss" military issues with "more freedom."

    五角大楼内部发生风波  发展导弹负责人掼纱帽
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：正当美国国会在调查美国为什么在人造卫星和火箭方面落后于苏联的时候，负责发展“丘辟特”式导弹的美国陆军研究和发展室主任詹姆斯·加文中将4日突然宣布他决定退出陆军。
    加文最近在参议院军备小组委员会作证的时候曾经说，他和相当大的一部分军官都认为苏联“已经代替美国成为世界上最先进的军事强国”，他要求美国彻底改组参谋长联席会议的机构。
    美国报纸曾经报道说，加文的那次作证惹怒了国防部的高一级官员，他们要求他收回他的主张。
    加文说，他退休以后可以“较自由地评述和议论”军事问题。
