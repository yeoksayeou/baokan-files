Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first meeting of the Presidium of the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which concluded in Beijing on the 17th, determined that the main task of the national trade union system this year is to lead the emerging new upsurge in production effectively. In order to make this upsurge develop more broadly, deeply, and sustainably, the current focus should be on grasping the central link of the rectification campaign, raising the class consciousness of workers, and improving trade union work, so that trade union organizations become vibrant fighting organizations closely linked to the masses.

This meeting began on the 15th of this month. The meeting studied the current work situation in the industrial, transportation, commercial and other departments, and held that since the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, the new production upsurge in various places has further developed. In particular, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call in its congratulatory message to the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions to strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years, the revolutionary zeal of workers in various places has been great. Workers in Shanghai, Liaoning, Beijing and other places have already put forward the goal and initiative of learning from the advanced and carrying out socialist emulation. In the discussion of this year's national plan, many units have repeatedly broken through the original targets. New rationalization proposals and inventions are also constantly emerging. Therefore, the meeting pointed out that in the face of this surging new production upsurge, trade union organizations at all levels must seriously solve the problems raised by the masses and promptly study and summarize new work experiences under new conditions. When various enterprises concentrate on carrying out an anti-waste campaign during the rectification and reform stage, trade union organizations should call on workers to expose various wasteful phenomena, educate workers to conserve raw materials, cherish machines, and further implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results and building the country through diligence and thrift. The meeting also demanded that trade union organizations at all levels oppose conservative thinking, promote the pioneering spirit of the masses, improve technology, increase production efficiency, and strive for a great leap forward in industrial production in organizing workers to carry out socialist emulation.

According to the progress of the rectification movement in factories, mines and enterprises and the trade union system in various places, the meeting held that continuing to deepen the rectification movement is still the central task of trade union organizations at all levels. The task of the trade union in the rectification is, on the one hand, to continue to strengthen socialist education for workers, help enterprise administrations improve management and purify the ranks of the working class, and on the other hand, to thoroughly rectify the work of the trade union itself. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, various industrial and provincial and municipal trade unions must conscientiously help grassroots trade unions to comprehensively rectify, and at the same time, formulate methods for training and improving cadres and improving work style.

The meeting requested trade unions at all levels to spend the necessary time to investigate and study issues such as workers' wages, living conditions, and labor insurance, and to cooperate with relevant departments to rely on the masses to conscientiously solve these problems. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the work of county and township trade unions, agricultural and water conservancy trade unions, publicize the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program among workers, and educate workers to support agriculture with practical actions.

    今年工会系统的主要任务是什么？
    发扬职工首创精神争取生产大跃进
    据新华社讯　17日在北京结束的全国总工会第八届执行委员会主席团第一次会议确定，今年全国工会系统的主要任务是：必须领导好已经出现的生产新高潮。为了使这个高潮更加广泛、深入、持久地发展起来，当前要抓住整风运动这一中心环节，提高职工的阶级觉悟，改进工会工作，使工会组织成为密切联系群众的、朝气勃勃的战斗组织。
    这次会议是在本月15日开始的。会议研究了目前工业、交通、商业等部门的工作情况，认为自从中国工会第八次代表大会以来，各地的生产新高潮已经有了进一步发展，特别是中共中央在工会“八大”祝词中提出争取十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的号召以后，各地职工的革命干劲很大。上海、辽宁、北京等地的职工，都已经提出了向先进看齐和开展社会主义竞赛的目标和倡议。在讨论今年的国家计划中，许多单位都已经一再突破了原定的指标。新的合理化建议和创造发明也在不断出现。因此，会议指出，在这个汹涌澎湃的新的生产高潮面前，各级工会组织必须认真解决群众提出来的问题，及时研究和总结在新的条件下面的新的工作经验。当各企业在整改阶段集中进行一次反浪费运动时，工会组织要号召职工揭发各种浪费现象，教育职工节约原料，爱护机器，进一步贯彻多、快、好、省和勤俭建国的方针。会议还要求各级工会组织在组织职工开展社会主义竞赛中，必须反对保守思想，发扬群众首创精神，改进技术，提高生产效率，争取工业生产上的大跃进。
    会议根据各地厂矿企业和工会系统整风运动的进展情况，认为继续深入开展整风运动，仍然是各级工会组织的中心工作。工会在整风中的任务，一方面要继续加强对职工的社会主义教育，帮助企业行政改进经营管理和纯洁工人阶级队伍，另一方面要彻底整改工会本身的工作。全国总工会、各产业和各省市的工会，都要认真地帮助基层工会全面整改，同时要订出锻炼、提高干部和改进工作作风的办法。
    会议要求各级工会花费必要的时间，对职工工资、生活和劳动保险等问题进行调查研究，配合有关部门依靠群众认真解决这些问题。同时，要加强县镇工会、农业水利工会的工作，在职工中宣传全国农业发展纲要修正草案，教育职工以实际行动支援农业。
