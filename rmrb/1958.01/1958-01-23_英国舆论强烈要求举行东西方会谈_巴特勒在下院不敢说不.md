Xinhua News Agency, London, January 22nd: The pressure within Britain for holding East-West summit talks is constantly growing. The British House of Commons reconvened on January 21st after the Christmas recess. Labour Party members put a series of questions to the government regarding the issue of holding East-West summit talks. In his reply, acting Prime Minister Butler had to admit that "the majority of public opinion in Britain is in favor of such talks," and he promised that the British government would "consider" "such strong sentiments."

Labour MP Swingler demanded in his questioning that the government propose a date for holding a summit meeting and expressed opposition to holding the foreign ministers' meeting that Western countries were trying hard to promote in order to delay the summit meeting. He pointed out that "the vast majority of people in all parts of Britain are demanding such a summit meeting as soon as possible."

Former Labour Foreign Secretary Morrison criticized the government for failing to put forward its own positive proposals to promote world peace. He asked: Is the government intending to spend its entire term in office simply responding to letters from the Soviet government?

In answering these questions, acting Prime Minister Butler admitted that "the majority of public opinion" in Britain was in favor of holding an East-West summit meeting. He also said that he had seen the results of public opinion polls held on this issue. He said that when Macmillan replied to Bulganin's second letter, which specifically addressed the summit meeting, "the issues that public opinion has such strong feelings about will undoubtedly be considered."

Labour MP Henderson demanded that diplomatic negotiations begin immediately to prepare for the holding of an East-West summit meeting. Butler replied that there should be a period of preparation before holding such a meeting and that there "must be cooperation and consultation with the United States."

Labour MP Dodds expressed opposition to this point. He asked: Why doesn't the British government take steps on its own to enable the summit meeting to be convened in order to resolve international problems through peaceful negotiations? He accused the government of lacking initiative on this issue.

At the same time, Dodds emphasized that Macmillan's reply to Bulganin's first letter not only did not improve the situation but made it worse.

Labour leader Gaitskell demanded clarification on the issue of so-called "preparation" for the summit meeting. He pointed out that it was not necessary to hold a foreign ministers' meeting to carry out preparatory work. He asked, is it impossible to carry out preparations through diplomatic channels?

Labour foreign affairs spokesman Bevan expressed support for Gaitskell's opinion. Bevan emphasized that if the preparatory work was for the purpose of convening a summit meeting, a resolution on convening a summit meeting should first be adopted, and a date for the meeting should be set as early as possible.

Butler replied that he agreed that, in preparing for the summit meeting, "there is no need to specifically prescribe the exact method of preparation." Butler said that they should wait for Macmillan to reply to Bulganin's second letter, and he hoped that Macmillan's second reply "would not disappoint the House of Commons."

Outside Parliament, the British Peace Committee has prepared a letter to be submitted to Parliament demanding that summit talks be held. Many trade union leaders and prominent figures have signed the letter.

These days, British newspapers have been publishing calls for a summit meeting almost every day. Many Labour MPs are giving talks and writing articles.

    英国舆论强烈要求举行东西方会谈
    巴特勒在下院不敢说不
    据新华社伦敦22日电　英国国内要求举行东西方最高级会谈的压力正在不断增长。英国下院在圣诞节休假之后在1月21日复会。工党议员就举行东西方最高级会谈问题向政府提出了一连串质问。代理首相巴特勒在答复中不得不承认，英国“大部分舆论是赞成这样的会谈”的，他许诺英国政府要“考虑”“这样强烈的情绪”。
    工党议员斯文格勒在质问中要求政府提出举行最高级会议的日期，并且表示反对举行西方国家竭力主张举行的外长会议来拖延举行最高级会议。他指出，英国“各地绝大多数的人民要求早日举行这样的最高级会议”。
    前工党外交大臣摩里逊指责政府提不出自己的可以促进世界和平的积极建议，他问道：政府是不是打算在它的全部执政期间都只是在回答苏联政府的信件呢？
    代理首相巴特勒在回答这些问题时承认，英国“大部分舆论”都主张举行东西方最高级会议。他还说，他看到了就这个问题举行的民意测验的结果。他说，在麦克米伦回答布尔加宁特别谈到最高级会议的第二封信的时候，“舆论对之有这样强烈的情绪的这些问题无疑是会得到考虑的”。
    工党议员汉德逊要求立即开始进行外交谈判来筹备举行东西方最高级会议。巴特勒回答说，在举行这种会议以前，应该有一个准备的时期，并且“必须同美国进行合作和磋商”。
    工党议员多兹表示反对这一点。他问道：为什么英国政府不自行采取步骤使得最高级会议得以召开以便通过和平谈判来解决国际问题呢？他指责政府在这个问题上缺乏主动精神。
    同时，多兹强调指出，麦克米伦首相对布尔加宁第一封信的复信不仅没有使情况好转，反而使情况恶化了。
    工党领袖盖次克尔要求对所谓“准备”最高级会议的问题加以澄清。他指出，没有必要非举行外长会议来进行准备工作不可。他问道，通过外交途径来进行准备难道是不可能的吗？
    工党外交问题发言人比万表示支持盖次克尔的意见。比万强调指出，如果进行筹备工作是为了召开最高级会议的话，首先就应该通过一项关于召开最高级会议的决议，并且应该尽可能早地定出召开日期。
    巴特勒回答说，他同意，在为最高级会议进行准备方面，“并不需要具体规定准备的确切办法”。巴特勒说，应该等待麦克米伦来答复布尔加宁的第二封信，希望麦克米伦的第二封复信“不致使下院失望”。
    在议会外面，英国和平委员会已经准备好了将要提交给议会的要求举行最高级会谈的信件。许多工会领袖和著名人物都在这封信上签了名。
    这些日子来，英国许多报纸上几乎每天不断地刊载着要求举行最高级会议的呼声。不少工党议员在发表着谈话和文章。
