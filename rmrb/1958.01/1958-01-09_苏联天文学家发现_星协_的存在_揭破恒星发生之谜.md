Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: The Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory of the Armenian Republic Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union has become world-renowned for its significant contributions to the study of the origin and evolution of celestial bodies over the past few years. One of the world's largest radio telescopes was built at this observatory last year.

Under the leadership of Academician Ambartsumian, the observatory has recently solved an important mystery of stellar formation. They discovered the existence of "stellar associations," proving that stars are formed at different times and that the process of star formation within these associations is still ongoing. This refutes the idealists' hypothesis that stars are created simultaneously and will be destroyed billions of years later. They have also mastered the method of determining the speed at which young stars leave their natal cradles. Sunspots are particularly active. Ambartsumian believes that this is due to the seepage of certain substances from deep inside the sun, which reach the surface, emit enormous amounts of energy, and greatly enhance radio waves. The staff of the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory are currently studying the powerful processes of sudden energy release that occur particularly frequently in some young stars within stellar associations. Ambartsumian believes that the release of energy is also determined by the matter from which those stars originated, the so-called "pre-stellar matter." The earlier the stage of development of the star being studied, the more fully the unusual properties of matter will be elucidated.

Ambartsumian emphasized that astronomical research is of great significance for using science to benefit mankind. After astrophysicists discovered that the energy source of solar radiation is thermonuclear reactions, people created similar phenomena on Earth in the form of hydrogen bomb explosions. Now astronomers are observing energy release processes occurring on some stars that are much stronger than those occurring inside the sun, and explosions that are billions of times stronger than hydrogen bomb explosions.

    苏联天文学家发现“星协”的存在
    揭破恒星发生之谜
    据新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联亚美尼亚共和国科学院布拉干天体物理观测台已经因为它几年来对天体的发生和发展的研究做出的巨大贡献而闻名全世界。世界上最大的无线电天文望远镜之一去年就是在这个观测台上建成的。
    这个天文台近年来在阿姆巴楚米扬院士领导下解决了一项重要的恒星发生之谜。他们发现了“星协”的存在，证明恒星是在不同时期形成的，星协内恒星形成过程现在还在继续。这就推翻了唯心主义者关于恒星是同时产生并将在数十亿年后消灭的假说。他们还掌握了确定年青的恒星离开它们出生时的窠的速度。太阳黑子部分是特别活动的。阿姆巴楚米扬认为，这是从太阳内部深处渗出某种物质，这种物质来到表面，发出巨量的能和增强许多倍的无线电波。布拉干天体物理观测台人员目前正在研究星协内的一些年青的恒星上特别频繁发生的、突然释放能量的强力过程。阿姆巴楚米扬认为，能的释放也是由那些恒星所由发生的物质、即所谓“星前物质”决定的。被研究的恒星发展阶段越早，物质的这种不平常的性质也将被阐明得更充分。
    阿姆巴楚米扬强调指出，天文学研究对利用科学造福人类有重要意义。在天体物理学家发现太阳辐射能源是热核反应以后，人们在地球上也以氢弹爆炸形式造成了类似现象。现在天文学家们正在观察某些恒星上发生的、比太阳内部发生的强得多的释放能的过程和比氢弹爆炸强烈数十亿倍的爆发了。
