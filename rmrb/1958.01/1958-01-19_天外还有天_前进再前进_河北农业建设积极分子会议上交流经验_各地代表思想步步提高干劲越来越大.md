Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, January 17th: The Hebei Province held a Socialist Agricultural Construction Activists Representative Conference in Baoding from the 8th to the 15th. More than 1,000 representatives unanimously stated that they would muster even greater revolutionary enthusiasm to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain and cotton production this year.

This conference was a mobilization meeting for activists on the agricultural front in Hebei Province, an inspection meeting for the production leap forward team, and it was convened when the province's winter agricultural production had achieved great victories. The participants included various model figures and activists on the agricultural front, and representatives from well-known agricultural model units from all over the country were also invited.

The representatives of the nationally renowned Da Shan Agricultural Cooperative from Junan County, Shandong Province, the representatives from Macheng County, Hubei Province, who created the miracle of both cotton and wheat bumper harvests, the representatives from Xinxiang Special Zone, Henan Province, who managed the Mang River, the representatives from Xingyang County, Shaanxi Province, who had rich experience in advanced shallow irrigation, and the representatives from Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, who managed Daquan Mountain, all introduced their advanced experiences to the conference.

Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, pointed out in his report: Last year, nine counties and two cities in Hebei Province had already achieved or exceeded the target of an average yield of 400 jin of grain per mu; eight counties and one city had achieved or exceeded the target of an average yield of 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu. At the same time, many advanced cooperatives and high-yield fields with grain yields of 500 jin, 800 jin, 1,000 jin, and even double 1,000 jin per mu, and cotton yields of more than 100 jin and even more than 300 jin per mu, have emerged. Since the beginning of winter, a production leap forward upsurge centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation has emerged throughout the province. Wheat winter irrigation, topdressing, and other management activities are being carried out enthusiastically. Yan Dakai said that the central topic of this conference is how to muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm on the basis of such great victories and continue to advance by leaps and bounds.

During the conference, in addition to fully exchanging experiences through general meetings, group meetings, and forums, the representatives also visited the large-scale Hebei Provincial Agricultural Bumper Harvest Exhibition. The exhibition compared the grain and cotton yields of each county and city in the province in 1957 and the increase or decrease compared to 1952, which greatly inspired and educated the representatives. After the visit, the representatives from backward areas expressed that they would speed up and catch up with the advanced areas, and the representatives from advanced areas also expressed that they would overcome and prevent complacency and continue to move forward. Some representatives originally came to the conference with a complacent attitude of "introducing their own advanced experience." After seeing the high-yield achievements of the advanced areas at the exhibition, they realized that "there is a sky beyond the sky." Some representatives from mountainous and saline-alkali areas, after seeing the achievements of the mountainous cooperatives in Xingtai Special Zone and the coastal cooperatives in Cangxian Special Zone with yields of 1,000 jin per mu, strengthened their confidence and expressed that they would work hard to change production conditions and realize a great leap forward in production.

The advanced experiences introduced by the representatives of Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong and other provinces gave everyone great encouragement and enabled them to learn a lot of skills.

During the conference, the thinking of the representatives of agricultural activists from various regions improved step by step, and their enthusiasm became greater and greater. Many people called or wrote to their respective counties, townships, and cooperatives several times, asking to raise the originally set leap forward targets, and the representatives from the nearby Baoding Special Zone also invited people from their area to study together in person. The representatives reflected that this was an agricultural promotion meeting, but first and foremost a thought promotion meeting.

On the last day of the conference, all the representatives unanimously adopted a letter to the members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, expressing that they must, together with the members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, actively respond to the call of the Party, strive to realize the great leap forward in agriculture in the province, complete this year's 22 billion jin of grain, 700 million jin of cotton, and 800 million jin of peanuts, catch up with or exceed the production level and income level of well-to-do middle peasants, and strive to complete the glorious task of the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Thirty advanced counties and cities and fifteen advanced cooperatives with yields of 800 jin and 1,000 jin per mu also issued a letter of initiative to agricultural cooperatives in various counties and cities throughout the province. The initiative of the thirty advanced counties and cities proposed that, except for Shangdu in the high and cold area of ​​Saibei Ba ​​Shang, Wanquan in the mountainous area at the foot of the Great Wall, and Jinghai and Qingxian in the low-lying saline-alkali area, twenty-six counties should achieve a grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu this year. Among them, Gaocheng, Zhengding, and Luancheng counties plan to achieve an average yield of 800 jin per mu, and Xingtai City, Zunhua, Anguo, Ningjin, Baixiang, Shijiazhuang City, Linzhang, Funing, Leting, Jin County, Wuji, and Lulong twelve counties and cities plan to achieve an average yield of more than 500 jin and 600 jin per mu. This initiative was immediately warmly responded to by the representatives of eight special zones and sixty-seven counties and cities attending the meeting.

Finally, Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor, spoke. He put forward ten specific requirements for increasing production, and asked all localities to thoroughly implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally, increasing accumulation, and saving consumption; and to organize competitions in a planned way. He said that experience has proved that organizing competitions can encourage enthusiasm and exchange experience. Special zones should organize competitions between counties, counties should organize competitions between townships and cooperatives, and townships and cooperatives should organize competitions between production teams and members. However, in the competition, the spirit of humbly learning and self-criticism should be implemented to prevent possible deviations.

    天外还有天  前进再前进
    河北农业建设积极分子会议上交流经验
    各地代表思想步步提高干劲越来越大
    据新华社保定17日电　河北省在8日到15日在保定召开社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议，一千多名代表一致表示要鼓起更高的革命干劲，确保今年粮棉生产全面丰收。
    这次大会是河北省农业战线上积极分子誓师大会，是生产跃进队伍的检阅大会，并且是在全省冬季农业生产取得巨大胜利的时候召开的。参加大会的有农业战线上各种各样的模范人物和积极分子，同时还邀请了全国各地著名的农业模范单位的代表。
    应邀参加大会的全国著名的山东莒南县大山农业社代表、创造棉麦两丰收奇迹的湖北麻城县代表、治理蟒河的河南新乡专区代表、有丰富的细水浅浇先进经验的陕西陉阳县代表、治理大泉山的山西阳高县代表等，都向大会介绍了他们的先进经验。
    中共河北省委书记、副省长阎达开在报告中指出：去年河北省已经有九个县和两个市粮食平均亩产达到或超过了四百斤的指标；有八个县和一个市皮棉平均亩产达到或超过了六十斤的指标。同时，还出现了许多粮食亩产五百斤、八百斤、一千斤甚至双千斤的和棉花亩产一百斤以上甚至三百斤以上的先进社、丰产田典型。入冬以来，全省出现了以水利、积肥为中心的生产跃进高潮。小麦冬浇、追肥等管理活动正在热烈展开。阎达开说，这次会议的中心议题就是如何在这样巨大的胜利基础上，鼓起更大的革命干劲，继续大踏步地前进。
    大会期间，代表们除通过大会、小组会、座谈会等充分交流经验以外，还参观了规模宏大的河北省农业丰产展览会。展览会把全省各县、市1957年粮棉产量高低、较1952年增减情况加以对比，给代表们很大启发和教育。参观后，后进地区的代表表示要快马加鞭赶上先进地区，先进地区代表也表示要克服和防止自满情绪继续前进。有些代表原来抱着“介绍自己先进经验”的自满情绪来参加会议，在展览会上看到先进地区高额产量的事迹以后，才知道“天外还有天”。一些山区、盐碱地区的代表，在看了邢台专区的山区社和沧县专区沿海社亩产千斤的事迹以后，增强了信心，表示要努力改变生产条件，实现生产大跃进。
    湖北、河南、陕西、山西、山东等省代表介绍的先进经验，给大家以极大的鼓舞，使大家学到了很多本领。
    会议过程中，各地农业积极分子代表们的思想步步提高，干劲越来越大，许多人几次给本县、本乡、本社打电话写信，要求提高原订的跃进指标，附近的保定专区代表还把本地区人请来当面研究。代表们反映，这是一个农业促进会，首先又是思想促进会。
    会议最后一天，全体代表一致通过了给全省农业社社员的一封信，表示一定要同全省农业社社员们一起，积极响应党的号召，为实现全省农业大跃进，为完成今年二百二十亿斤粮食、七亿斤棉花、八亿斤花生，赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平和收入水平，提前实现农业发展纲要的光荣任务而奋斗。三十个先进县、市和十五个亩产八百斤、一千斤的先进社，并且向全省各县市的农业社提出倡议书。三十个先进县、市的倡议书中提出，除塞外坝上高寒地区的商都、长城脚下山区的万全、低洼盐碱地区静海、青县以外，二十六个县要在今年达到粮食亩产四百斤以上。其中藁城、正定、栾城三县计划达到平均亩产八百斤，邢台市、遵化、安国、宁津、柏乡、石家庄市、临漳、抚宁、乐亭、晋县、无极、卢龙十二个县市计划平均亩产达到五百斤、六百斤以上。这个倡议立即得到参加会议的八个专区六十七个县市代表的热烈响应。
    最后，中共河北省委第一书记、省长林铁讲了话。他提出了十项具体增产要求，并要求各地深入地贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，增加积累，节约消费；要有计划地组织评比。他说，经验证明，组织评比可以鼓舞干劲，可以交流经验。专区要组织县与县的评比，县要组织乡、社的评比，乡、社要组织生产队、社员之间的评比。但评比中要贯彻虚心学习和自我批评的精神，防止可能发生的偏向。
