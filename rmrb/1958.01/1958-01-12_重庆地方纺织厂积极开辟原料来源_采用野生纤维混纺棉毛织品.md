Chongqing Local Textile Factories Actively Explore Raw Material Sources
Use Wild Fibers Blended with Cotton and Wool to Produce Fabrics

(Reported by our newspaper) Chongqing's local textile and knitting industries will extensively use wild fibers this year to increase production of various colored wool-linen and cotton-linen blended and interwoven fabrics, to further meet market needs.

The China Wool Textile Factory recently produced its first batch of tweed woven with 50% hemp down and wool. After testing, the quality was found to be good, with wear resistance, strength, and warmth retention all meeting clothing requirements. Various women's clothing made from these tweeds were exhibited and welcomed by consumers, and the price was more than half that of pure wool fabrics. The China Wool Textile Factory has now arranged to produce 100,000 meters of this wool-linen blended fabric this year and will begin supplying it to the market before the Spring Festival. The Chongqing Knitting Factory has also decided to use 25% hemp down blended yarn this year to weave 7,000 dozen spring and autumn shirts, which will not only meet market needs but also increase the country's wealth by 170,000 yuan.

In order to extensively use wild fibers this year and increase production of fabrics such as purple serge, denim, plain cloth, and canvas, the Chongqing Textile Industry Company has sent special personnel to the producing areas to purchase them.

    重庆地方纺织厂积极开辟原料来源
    采用野生纤维混纺棉毛织品
    本报讯　重庆市地方纺织、针织工业各厂，今年将大量采用野生纤维增产许多花色的毛麻、棉麻混纺织品和交织品，以进一步满足市场需要。
    中国毛纺织厂最近第一批利用50％麻绒与羊毛织出的花呢，经过鉴定质量良好，耐磨、强力和保温度都合乎衣着要求。用这些花呢制成的各式女式服装展出后，受到消费者的欢迎，价格也比纯毛织品低一半以上。现在，中国毛纺织厂已经安排今年要生产这种毛麻混纺织品十万公尺，并在春节前即开始供应市场。重庆针织厂也决定今年采用麻绒25％混纺纱织造春秋衫七千打，这样既满足了市场需要，又可为国家增产十七万元财富。
    重庆市纺织工业公司为了在今年大量地采用野生纤维，增产紫色呢、劳动布、平布、帆布等布匹，已派出专人到产地收购。
