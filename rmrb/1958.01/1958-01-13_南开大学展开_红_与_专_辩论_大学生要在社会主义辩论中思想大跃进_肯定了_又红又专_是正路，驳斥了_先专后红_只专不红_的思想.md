    Nankai University Launches "Red" Versus "Expert" Debate
    College Students to Make Ideological Great Leap Forward in Socialist Debate
    Affirmed "Both Red and Expert" as the Correct Path, Refuted Ideas of "Expert First, Red Later" and "Only Expert, Not Red"
    (Our Newspaper News) Nankai University's three thousand students recently launched a debate on the issue of "Red and Expert" within the socialist ideological education curriculum, in conjunction with rectification. The debate has now come to a conclusion, and every student has received a profound socialist ideological education.
    This debate, under the leadership of the Party Committee and the Socialist Ideological Education Research Group, guided everyone to engage in heated debates based on some ideological problems exposed by students in the relationship between "politics and professional work." From December of last year to the beginning of January this year, the entire university held thousands of group, class, grade, and department-wide debates. Some professors, including the Academic Affairs Director and department heads, were also invited to participate in the discussions. The professors' special speeches and reports, combined with their personal experiences of the political direction of intellectuals before and after liberation, aroused students to further deepen the debate. Some classes and departments also used big-character posters and blackboards to raise questions and answer each other, forming a good atmosphere of free debate throughout the school.
    In this great debate, the issues that were debated endlessly were which was more important and fundamental between "Red and Expert," whether there was a contradiction between "Red and Expert," and whether the path of "Expert First, Red Later" was viable. Some students advocated for professional work first. They believed that "Red" meant politics, which meant class struggle. "At present, our country's large-scale class struggle has basically ended. From now on, our main task is to build socialism and open fire on nature. Building socialism requires scientific experts." Some students believed that living in a socialist society, there was no difference between being "Red" or not being "Red." After learning skills, they would serve socialism anyway and could not serve capitalism. Some students affirmed that "the task of college students is to learn certain professional knowledge and skills, and to participate in construction after graduation. From this stage's perspective, professional work is obviously more important than politics." Some students suggested that there should be different political requirements for students in liberal arts and science. Some liberal arts students said, "Our professional work is highly political. Learning professional work is learning politics. In Marxist-Leninist history and literature, we can learn the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method. Natural science has no class nature, and science students should engage in more politics." However, many science students said, "The work that liberal arts students do is highly political. An erroneous viewpoint in an article can harm thousands of readers, so they should pay more attention to politics. It doesn't matter much if we science students engage in less politics. For a natural scientist, the most important thing is the conscience of a scientist. As long as they have the interest in studying science and the ideal of benefiting mankind, that's enough."
    When discussing whether there was a contradiction between "Red" and "Expert," some students believed that there was a contradiction. "A person's energy is limited. Engaging in more politics will inevitably lead to less professional work." They proposed "division of labor between politics and professional work" based on the principle of social division of labor. Some people can specialize in politics and become politicians, while others can specialize in professional work and become scientists.
    When discussing the fundamental path of intellectuals, some students advocated "Expert First, Red Later" and "More Expert, Less Red." They believed that this path actually existed, although it was somewhat dangerous. They said: "Both Red and Expert" is like the Yangtze River Bridge, safe and secure, while "Expert First, Red Later" is like a "single-plank bridge." As long as you are careful, there will be no accidents. Based on the fact that many old experts in our country were unable to contact Marxism-Leninism in the past, transform their thinking, and only improved their consciousness after liberation, some of whom became both Red and Expert working-class intellectuals; and the fact that not all experts cultivated after liberation are "Red experts," they concluded that: "If it is said that in the old society, one who stays near vermilion gets stained red, then in the new society, one who stays near red will naturally be red. Everything you hear and see is socialism, and those who are not 'Red' will naturally become 'Red.' The path of Expert First, Red Later is feasible." Some students explained that "Expert First, Red Later" and "More Expert, Less Red" still require being "Red." "Only Expert, Not Red" is problematic and easily becomes a rightist or acts as a prisoner of rightists. Having "a little Red" eliminates these concerns. Some students even believed that most college students support socialism, can obey assignments, and are basically "Red." "Red" is easy, while "Expert" is "a lifelong matter," "learning is endless."
    After the above-mentioned ideological viewpoints were put forward one after another, students asked to launch a debate, and a sharp confrontation emerged. Many students sharply pointed out, based on the nature of our country and what kind of specifications socialist college students should have: what kind of intellectuals do we want to be, and what kind of path do we want to take? They refuted the view of professional work first. Throughout history, professional work has first and foremost served politics and a certain class; socialist society is no exception. Although our country's large-scale class struggle has basically ended, class struggle has not been extinguished, and "the socialist communist political direction is a primary issue." Liu Ziming, a student in the mathematics department, said, "Any wavering of the primacy of politics will lead to a blurring of the enemy and ourselves." Li Guangyu exposed that the slogan "politics serves professional work" "essentially requires class struggle to serve scientific research and the working class to serve intellectuals." Many students, in connection with the performance of students in the school's anti-rightist struggle, realized that the political education and ideological transformation of college students is still an arduous process, with more than half of the students still being middle-of-the-roaders, and it cannot be generally assumed that all college students are already "Red." Many students believed that "Red" and "Expert" should not be opposed to each other, and saying that there is a contradiction is an excuse to refuse ideological transformation. "Both Red and Expert" is not only necessary but also possible, and many working-class intellectuals have already set a learning example.
    Contrary to the understanding of those who advocate "Expert First, Red Later," many students clearly pointed out that this is definitely not a "shortcut" or an "effective method" issue, but a fundamental opposition in fundamental path and direction. "Expert First, Red Later" and "Only Expert, Not Red" are both "birds of a feather," both "abandoning socialism." Some students said that "Expert First, Red Later" is equal to "Expert First, White First," and those who advocate "a little Red" are "conciliators of capitalism and socialism, individualism and collectivism, and are essentially individualistic," while "the material basis of individualism has been eliminated in our country, and the individualistic expert path is definitely hopeless." The middle-of-the-road line is also destined to be shattered. Some students made an analogy: "The middle-of-the-roader is stepping on two boats, half-hearted about socialism, and reluctant to part with capitalism. When the wind and waves are calm, they may be able to stand firm, but when the great wind and waves come, they are in danger of being submerged." Liberal arts students also conducted an in-depth criticism of the view that learning professional work is learning politics. History students, in connection with the rightist Lei Haizong's saying that "slave society does not exist" and tampering with the principles of Marxist-Leninist historical science, and Chinese students, in connection with Feng Xuefeng and Liu Shaotang's opposition to socialist realism and promotion of bourgeois literary views, refuted the hypocrisy of this slogan, which is a "common trick" of rightists to confuse young people, and must be vigilant.
    At the end of the debate, Deputy Academic Affairs Director Teng Weizao made a summary report on the issue of Red and Expert. He emphasized that politics is fundamental and the soul. Expert First, Red Later or Only Expert, Not Red is a dangerous and impassable road and should be criticized. Only Both Red and Expert meets the requirements of all-round development.
    Teng Weizao pointed out that our Party has always adhered to the cadre policy of both moral integrity and ability. Studying politics well is very necessary for natural science workers. Scientists are individuals, and no one can be divorced from politics. Rightists do not allow young people to ask about politics, but they are very interested in politics. Their slogans should be exposed. To be divorced from socialist politics is to ask about capitalist politics.
    He said: Politics and professional work are not contradictory. From the perspective of long-term cultivation of talents with both moral integrity and ability, there is no contradiction. Among them, politics is the most fundamental and the soul, because to cultivate working-class intellectuals, they must first have clear political views. Only by establishing a communist worldview, standing firm, and serving the people wholeheartedly can we contribute our knowledge to the socialist cause. Without the desire to serve socialism, even if the professional work is very good, what contribution can such a person make to the country? It can even play a more negative and destructive role. Technology is very important in our country, but there is no reason to say that professional work is important and negate politics. To build socialism, it is impossible without political and organizational leadership, and without talents who wholeheartedly serve the people. The fact that the Soviet Union's two artificial satellites went into the sky proves the superiority of the socialist system and the high socialist consciousness of Soviet scientific and technical cadres.
    "Expert First, Red Later" is a bourgeois slogan, a refusal to transform thinking, to take the path of bourgeois intellectuals, and to lure young people not to ask about politics in order to be prisoners of the bourgeois rightists. People like Qian Weichang and Lei Haizong are calling on young people in this way. "Expert First, Red Later" reflects two problems: one is ignoring politics, and the other is not demanding high politics. In essence, it is a fame and fortune mentality for personal consideration. In the depths of their minds, they believe that professional work is easy to get along with and is capital. This is a hired worker's point of view. In the process of the debate, some students admired the old experts very much, thinking that they had come from the path of Expert First, Red Later, and therefore affirmed that Expert First, Red Later is a path. Scientists who came from the old society are now undergoing transformation and self-struggle. Today's old scientists, due to insufficient politics, have affected their work. Now they are making up for it. Under the current historical conditions, it is impossible to take the path of "Expert First, Red Later."
    Teng Weizao finally pointed out that in the era of the Great Leap Forward in the socialist revolution, the problem before us is whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. Taking the socialist road is a glorious road. But for bourgeois intellectuals, it will not be without difficulties. The road to reaching working-class intellectuals is arduous and tortuous and requires arduous ideological struggle. The idea of ​​smooth sailing is naive.
    This Nankai University's school-wide debate on the issue of "Red and Expert" has yielded rich ideological gains. Through the debate, students have greatly improved their understanding, clarified the training goals of socialist college students, and generally felt that it is necessary to be "Red," and it is not possible not to be "Red." They have a clear understanding of the ideological essence and harm of "Only Expert, Not Red," "Expert First, Red Later," and "More Expert, Less Red," and the rights and wrongs have been basically clarified. The mass public opinion to resist "Expert First, Red Later" has begun to form. They also have a deeper understanding of the significance of participating in labor production to exercise and transform, and their enthusiasm for participating in physical labor has increased. At the same time, combined with the debate, the bourgeois individualist thinking existing among the students has also been criticized to a certain extent. Some people have taken the initiative to make self-criticisms in the discussion, and many classes have launched criticism and self-criticism. Through discussion, some new atmosphere has also begun to appear in the school. For example, recently, when discussing participation in physical labor, more than 90% of the students in the school signed up to participate in labor in the countryside during the winter vacation.

    南开大学展开“红”与“专”辩论
    大学生要在社会主义辩论中思想大跃进
    肯定了“又红又专”是正路，驳斥了“先专后红”“只专不红”的思想
    本报讯　南开大学全校三千名学生最近结合整改在社会主义思想教育课程中开展了“红与专”问题的大辩论，现在辩论已经告一段落，每个学生都受到了一次深刻的社会主义思想教育。
    这次辩论是在党委和社会主义思想教育教研组的领导下，根据学生中在“政治和业务”的关系上所暴露出来的一些思想问题引导大家展开热烈争辩的。从去年12月到今年1月初，全校举办了小组、班、年级及全系大会辩论上千次。部分教授包括教务长、系主任也被邀请参加了讨论会。教授们结合解放前后知识分子政治方向的亲身体验所作的专题发言及专题报告，引起了学生进一步深入展开了辩论。有的班系还利用大字报、黑板报提出问题，互相答辩，全校形成了自由争论的良好风气。
    在这次大辩论中，争论不休的是关于“红和专”那个更重要更根本，“红和专”有没有矛盾，“先专后红”的道路是否走得通的问题。有些同学主张业务第一。他们认为“红”就是政治，就是阶级斗争，“目前我国大规模阶级斗争已基本结束，从现在起我们主要的任务是建设社会主义，向自然界开火，建设社会主义非要科学专家不可。有的学生认为生活在社会主义社会，“红”不“红”没有什么差别，学了本领，横竖为社会主义服务，不可能为资本主义服务。有的同学肯定，“大学生的任务是学习一定的专业知识技术，毕业后参加建设，就这阶段来看，业务显然比政治重要”。有些学生提出，对文科和理科学生在政治上应该有不同要求。有的文科学生说，“我们的业务政治性很强，学业务就是学政治，马列主义的历史学、文艺学，都可学到无产阶级的立场观点方法；自然科学没有阶级性，理科学生要多搞点政治”。但是不少的理科学生说，“文科学生从事的工作政治性很高，写一篇文章观点错误便贻害千百个读者，应该多注意政治；我们理科学生少搞点政治关系不大，对一个自然科学家来说，最主要的是科学家的良心，只要有研究科学的兴趣和造福于人类的理想就行了。”
    在讨论“红”和“专”有没有矛盾时，有些同学认为是存在矛盾的。“一个人的精力有限，多搞些政治，势必少搞些业务”。他们根据社会分工的原则提出“政治和业务分工”，有的人可以专搞政治，成为政治家；有的人可以专搞业务，成为科学家。
    在讨论知识分子的根本道路时，有些学生主张“先专后红”、“多专少红”。他们认为这条路事实上是存在的，虽然有些危险。他们说：“又红又专”好像长江大桥，保险安全，而“先专后红”犹如“独木桥”，只要小心在意，照样不出事故。他们根据我国许多老专家过去未能接触马列主义，改造思想，解放后才提高觉悟，其中有部分人成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的事实；和解放后培养出来的专家也不都是“红色专家”的事实，得出结论说：“如果说在旧社会，近墨者黑，那么在新社会，必然近朱者赤，耳濡目染全是社会主义，不‘红’的人也自然而然‘红’起来，先专后红的道路是可行的。”有的学生解释说：“先专后红”、“多专少红”还是要“红”的，“只专不红”才有问题，容易变成右派或充当右派俘虏，有“一点红”就没有这种顾虑了。有的学生更认为大多数大学生拥护社会主义，能服从分配，基本上是“红”了；“红”是容易的，“专”才是“一辈子的事情”，“学无止境”。
    以上这些思想观点陆续提出后，学生们纷纷要求展开辩论，出现了针锋相对的局面。许多学生根据我们国家的性质，社会主义大学生应该具备什么样的规格尖锐地指出：到底我们要做什么样的知识分子，走什么样的道路，批驳了业务第一的观点。有史以来，业务首先是为政治服务的，为一定阶级服务的；社会主义社会，也不能例外。固然我国目前大规模阶级斗争基本结束了，但阶级斗争并未熄灭，“社会主义共产主义政治方向是个首要的问题”。数学系学生刘子明说，“对政治首要性的任何动摇，都要导致敌我不分”。黎光禹揭穿“政治为业务服务”这口号“实质上要求阶级斗争为科学研究服务，要求工人阶级为知识分子服务”。许多学生联系本校学生反右派斗争的表现，认识到大学生政治教育思想改造还是一个艰巨的过程，半数以上学生还是中间派，不能一概认为大学生都已经是“红”的了。许多学生认为不应该把“红”和“专”对立起来，说有矛盾的就是拒绝思想改造的借口。“又红又专”不但是必要的，也是可能的，许多工人阶级知识分子已经树立了学习的榜样。
    和“先专后红”论者的认识相反，许多学生明确指出，这绝对不是一条“捷径”，不是什么“有效方法”问题，而是根本道路根本方向的对立。“先专后红”和“只专不红”同是“一丘之貉”，同是“背弃了社会主义”。有的学生说“先专后红”等于“先专先白”，“一点红”论者便是“资本主义和社会主义，个人主义和集体主义的调和派，本质上是个人主义的”，而“个人主义的物质基础已在我国消灭了，个人主义的专家道路肯定是没有前途的”。中间派路线也是注定要破灭的。有的学生作了比喻说：“中间派是脚踩两只船，对社会主义三心两意，对资本主义恋恋不舍，风平浪静时或者站得住，大风大浪来了，就有惨遭没顶的危险”。文科学生还对学业务即学政治的观点进行深入批判。历史系学生结合右派分子雷海宗说什么“奴隶社会不存在”，篡改马列主义历史科学原理，中文系学生结合冯雪峰、刘绍棠的反对社会主义现实主义，宣扬资产阶级文艺观点，驳斥了这个口号的虚伪性，是右派分子迷惑青年的“惯技”，必须警惕。
    辩论最后，副教务长滕维藻作了红与专问题的总结报告。他着重指出政治是根本的，是灵魂。先专后红或只专不红是危险的，走不通的道路，应当批判。只有又红又专才符合全面发展的要求。
    滕维藻指出，我们党历来坚持德才兼备的干部政策。学好政治对自然科学工作者是非常必要的。科学家是个人，任何人是不能脱离政治的。右派分子不让青年人过问政治，但他们对政治兴趣很大，应当把他们的口号揭穿，脱离社会主义政治就是过问了资本主义的政治。
    他说：政治与业务并不矛盾，从长期培养德才兼备的人才来看是没有矛盾的。其中政治是最根本的，是灵魂，因为要培养工人阶级知识分子，就首先应具有明确的政治观点。只有建立起共产主义人生观，立场坚定，全心全意为人民服务，才能把知识贡献给社会主义事业。没有为社会主义服务的愿望，即使业务很好，这样的人对国家有什么贡献呢？甚至更能起消极破坏的作用。技术在我国很重要，但没有理由说业务重要而否定政治。要把社会主义建成，没有政治、组织领导，没有全心全意为人民服务的人才，是不可能的。苏联两个人造卫星上了天，正说明社会主义制度的优越性，以及苏联科学技术干部具有高度的社会主义觉悟。
    “先专后红”，是资产阶级的口号，是拒绝改造思想，走资产阶级知识分子的道路，是引诱青年不过问政治以作为资产阶级右派的俘虏。如钱伟长、雷海宗等，就是这样号召青年的。“先专后红”，反映了两个问题，一个是忽视政治，一个是对政治要求不高。实质上是为个人打算的名利思想。他们的思想深处认为业务是吃得开的，是资本。这就是雇佣观点。在辩论过程中，有些同学很羡慕老专家，认为他们是从先专后红的道路走过来的，因而肯定先专后红是一条道路。从旧社会来的科学家，现在正进行改造，自我斗争。今天的老科学家，由于政治上不够好，影响了他们的工作。现在他们正进行补课。在现在的历史条件下，不可能走“先专后红”的道路。
    滕维藻最后指出，在社会主义革命大跃进时代，摆在我们面前的问题就是走社会主义还是走资本主义道路问题。走社会主义道路是光荣的道路。但对资产阶级知识分子来说，是不会没有困难的。达到工人阶级知识分子的道路是艰巨曲折的，要经过艰苦的思想斗争。一帆风顺的想法是天真的。
    这次南开大学全校性“红与专”问题的大辩论是有丰富思想收获的。通过辩论，学生在认识上有了很大的提高，明确了社会主义大学生的培养目标，普遍感到必须要“红”，不“红”是不行的。对“只专不红”、“先专后红”、“多专少红”的思想本质及危害性有了明确的认识，是非基本上弄清了，抵制“先专后红”的群众舆论开始形成。对参加劳动生产来锻炼改造的意义也有了较深刻的了解，参加体力劳动的积极性提高了。同时，结合辩论，在同学中存在的资产阶级个人主义思想也受到了一定的批判，一些人在讨论中主动做了检讨，很多班展开了批评与自我批评。通过讨论在学校中也开始出现了一些新的气象。例如最近在讨论参加体力劳动时，全校有90％以上的学生报名要求在寒假中去农村参加劳动。
