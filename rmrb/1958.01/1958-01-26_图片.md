    Henan Linxian Shilou Village is located in the Taihang Mountains. During the Anti-Japanese War, the trees were all cut down by the enemy. Look, the youth afforestation team in this village is heading towards the barren mountains to plant trees on a large scale. Photo by Wei Dezhong (manuscript from Henan Daily)
