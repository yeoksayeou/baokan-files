    独裁政权激起人民不满
    委内瑞拉发生武装政变
    据新华社2日讯　加拉加斯消息：据西方通讯社报道，位于加拉加斯以西五十英里的马拉凯主要空军基地的空军和陆军在1日发动了反对希门尼斯独裁政权的武装政变。有一些其他地方的军队也参加了政变。同时，有消息说，在加拉加斯和其他大城市，学生们在街上游行示威。
    据举行武装政变部队的电台广播，他们占领了马拉凯城，现在正向委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯前进。他们还派了喷气飞机扫射了加拉加斯并且轰炸了总统府。广播电台要求希门尼斯立即辞职。
    希门尼斯政权现在正赶紧在纠集忠实于它的武装部队，对政变部队进行镇压。
    委内瑞拉这次武装政变是在委内瑞拉独裁政权正遭到国内各阶层人民强烈不满的情况下爆发的。
    来自华盛顿的消息说，美国政府官员对这次政变表示“异常关切”，并且认为“局势严重”。
