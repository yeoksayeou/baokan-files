	A Magnificent Heroic Ode
	—Watching the Soviet Film "The Brest Fortress"
	Ning Gan
	After watching the Soviet film "The Brest Fortress," it was like drinking a glass of strong vodka, my whole body felt warm, and I was excited for a long time.
	The film depicts the historical events of the Soviet Red Army defending the Brest Fortress on the border at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. Major Badulin, the regiment commander, and his subordinates, with no hope of breaking through, decided to perish with the fortress; they fought bloody battles for twenty-eight days and nights, and in the end, except for Regiment Commander Badulin, who fainted and was captured, all the remaining personnel heroically sacrificed in the battle.
	The story itself is extremely tragic; and the success of the film lies in its creation of several unforgettable heroic images, through their hard fighting, heroic sacrifice, fully demonstrating the Soviet Red Army's high patriotism and revolutionary heroism, powerfully illustrating the Soviet people's unyielding, inviolable heroic character, therefore, although the film depicts the successive sacrifices of many characters and the tragic scenes of the fall of the castle, it does not give you a gloomy, sad feeling, on the contrary, it burns like fire, giving you great excitement, encouragement and strength.
	The heroes of "The Brest Fortress" are not peculiar figures. Like all the people of the Soviet Union, they have their own relatives and friends, and different interests and hobbies. They love life, but they love the Soviet motherland even more. They know that without the Soviet motherland, there is nothing, therefore, for her, they are willing to sacrifice everything.
	Although Major Badulin and his wife have been married for many years and their son is already a teenager, the day before the outbreak of the war, when Badulin left home to take a vacation elsewhere, they were still reluctant to part like newlyweds and kissed goodbye on the street; Badulin loves his wife, and cares more about his troops. New recruits just came to the unit, and the veterans are about to demobilize; more importantly, they are defending the border on a small river, and on the other side is the fascist German army that has occupied fourteen countries in Europe, he is worried, so he unexpectedly returned from the station that night. He inspected the barracks, listened to the report, and late at night, returned to the dormitory. His wife greeted him with such surprise...The night, a beautiful and peaceful night, the soldier Gogolev, who is about to be demobilized, lies in bed reminiscing about his love with Valya, the daughter of the regimental political commissar, planning to marry after retirement and go to university together, but seeing the fascist German army walking around on the other side of the small river, he feels that his plan is not good; officer Ustinov and his lover are still talking intimately outside the window; Quartermaster Kukharkov, who loves photography, is developing photos; soldier Xie Ming does not want to go to political school and plans to return to the tractor station as a technician; regimental political commissar Peter is playing chess with an officer at the outpost outside the city, planning to go fishing at dawn...What a happy peaceful night for people!
	However, suddenly cannons roared, bombs fell, ... all the beautiful hopes and plans were shattered!
	The Brest Fortress was surrounded, cut off from all contact with the outside world. At first, they thought it was a local provocation, hoping for reinforcements to relieve the siege; but when they realized the truth of the situation, knowing that there was no hope of breaking through, they decided to defend the fortress to the end. Defense is very difficult, with few personnel, heavy casualties, and more seriously, no water to drink, which the army cannot endure, and the families hiding in the basement are even more difficult to endure! Many people were sacrificed to grab water. Because of the small number of people, Badulin sent his teenage son to grab water, and he also sacrificed,...At this time, the female military doctor Sasha suggested sending women and children out of the castle, but she stayed to continue fighting. After persuasion, Badulin's wife went out with the family members, but the German general forced her to come back with a white flag to persuade them to surrender. After she came back, she did not leave, threw the white flag on the ground and joined the battle. She knew that the future of the battle was death, but she was willing.
	When only Badulin, Kukharkov and other four people were left in the battle, they talked about surrendering in the basement in a mocking tone.
	"For example, take you, Comrade Kukharkov, why don't you surrender?" Badulin asked. Kukharkov smiled contemptuously and answered by singing: "For the Soviet regime, we must fight bravely, live and die together, bravely fight..."
	This is the reason why the Soviet Red Army of "The Brest Fortress" – Major Badulin and his subordinates would rather die than surrender, this is the inviolable heroic character of the Soviet people.
	Just as the film says at the end, the heroes who sacrificed in Brest did not see the victory of the war, of course, they did not know that on the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, a Soviet artificial satellite has appeared in the sky, and they will never know that today there are not two hundred million, but nine hundred million people advancing under the banner of socialism, but all these brilliant achievements are inseparable from their heroic sacrifices, they will always live in people's memory!

    一首雄壮的英雄颂歌
    ——看苏联影片“坚守要塞”
    宁干
    看完苏联影片“坚守要塞”之后，像喝了一杯浓烈的伏特加，全身热烘烘的，激动的心情很久难以平静。
    影片描写了卫国战争初期坚守着国境线上的布列斯特要塞的苏联红军的史迹。团长巴杜林少校和他的部下，突围无望，决心与城共存亡；他们浴血苦战二十八昼夜，打到最后，除了团长巴杜林昏厥被俘之外，其余人员全部在战斗中壮烈殉国了。
    这个故事本身便是极为悲壮的；而影片的成功之处，又在于它创作了几个令人难忘的英雄形象，通过他们苦守奋战、英勇牺牲的事迹，充分地表现出苏联红军的高度爱国主义精神和革命英雄主义精神，有力地说明了苏联人民不能屈、不可侮的英雄性格，因此，尽管影片描写了很多人物的相继牺牲和城堡陷落时的凄惨情景，但并不给你阴沉、伤悲之感，相反的倒像火一样燃烧着你，给你以莫大的激动、鼓舞和力量。
    “坚守要塞”的英雄们，并不是什么奇特人物，和苏联所有的人民一样，他们各有自己的亲人和朋友，各有不同的志趣和爱好。他们热爱生活，但更热爱苏维埃祖国。他们知道，没有苏维埃祖国，便没有一切，因之，为了她，他们愿意牺牲一切。
    少校巴杜林夫妇虽然结婚多年儿子都已经十几岁了，但是战争爆发前一天，巴杜林离家到外地休假时，他们还像新婚夫妇似的恋恋不舍地在街上吻别；巴杜林爱妻子，更关怀自己的部队部队里新兵刚来，老兵们要复员了；更主要的是他们防守在国境线小河上，对岸就是侵占了欧洲大小十四个国家的法西斯德国军队，他放心不下，因此当晚又从车站回来了。他视察了营房，听取了汇报，夜深时，才出家人意外地回到宿舍。妻子那样惊喜地接待他……夜，美丽而宁静的夜，即将复员的战士果戈列夫，躺在床上回味着和团政委女儿瓦丽亚的爱情，打算退伍后结婚，一同上高等学校，但是看到小河对岸法西斯德国军队走来走去，又感到自己这种打算不好；军官乌斯季诺夫和爱人仍在窗外谈情；爱好摄影的司务长库哈尔科夫在洗照片；战士谢明不愿上政治学校，计划回拖拉机站当技术员；团政委彼得在城外哨站和一个军官下棋，打算天亮时去钓鱼……和平宁静的夜，人们是多么幸福呀！
    可是，突然大炮轰鸣，炸弹落下，……一切美好的希望和打算都破灭了！
    布列斯特要塞陷入重围，与外界断了一切联系。开始他们还以为是局部的挑衅攻击，指望援军解围；但是当弄清局势真象时，知道突围无望便决定坚守要塞拼到底。坚守是很困难的，人员少，伤亡大，更严重的是没有水喝，军队难以忍受，躲在地下室的家属更难忍受！为了抢水牺牲了很多人。因为人员少，巴杜林把十几岁的儿子也派出抢水，结果也牺牲了，……这时，女军医莎莎提议把妇女孩子送出城堡去，可是她却留下来坚持战斗。巴杜林的妻子经过动员后和家属们一块出去了，但德国将军却逼她打着白旗回来劝降。她回来之后不走了，把白旗摔在地下参加了战斗。她明知战斗的前途是死，可是自己心甘情愿。
    战斗到只剩下巴杜林、库哈尔科夫等四个人时，在地下室中他们曾以嘲讽的口吻谈论到投降。
    “譬如拿你来说吧，库哈尔科夫同志，你为什么不投降？”巴杜林问道。库哈尔科夫轻蔑地一笑，唱起歌来回答：“为了苏维埃政权，我们要勇敢战斗，同生共死，勇敢地去战斗……”
    这就是“坚守要塞”的苏联红军——巴杜林少校和他的部下宁死不屈的原因，这就是苏联人民不可侮的英雄性格。
    正像影片结尾所说的，在布列斯特牺牲的英雄们，未能看到战争的胜利，当然，也不知道在伟大的十月革命四十年的今天，天空中已经出现了苏联人造卫星，也永远不能知道，今天已经不是两万万，而是有九万万人在高举着社会主义旗帜前进，可是，这一切辉煌成果，是与他们的英勇牺牲分不开的，他们永远活在人们的记忆里！
