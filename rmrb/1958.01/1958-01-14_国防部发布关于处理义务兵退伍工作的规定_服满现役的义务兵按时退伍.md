    Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China recently issued the "Regulations on Handling the Retirement of Conscripted Soldiers," stating that all sergeants and soldiers conscripted into the army after November 1, 1954, will be handled in accordance with these regulations upon retirement.
    The regulations state: Sergeants and soldiers who have completed their active service period should retire on time. When sergeants and soldiers retire, all units should organize intensive training to conduct education on socialism, patriotism, labor production, participation in militia organizations, compliance with government laws and decrees, unity with township and commune cadres, contact with the masses, and the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft)," to establish concepts of patriotism, love for the commune, and thrift. When sergeants and soldiers retire and leave their units, the leaders of each unit should give them a warm send-off and encourage them to actively participate in labor production, practice thrift, and maintain the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army.
    The regulations state: When sergeants and soldiers retire, they should be issued reserve service certificates and reserve service registration forms, and the head of the division or equivalent should determine their reserve service status. If they are unable to serve in the reserve for some reason, they will be designated as retired. After returning to their hometowns, they should take their military service certificate and military service registration form to the local county or city military service authority to register for reserve service. If the unit needs sergeants and soldiers who have completed their active service to serve beyond their term, they should explain the reasons to them, conduct education, and obtain their voluntary consent.
    The regulations point out that when sergeants and soldiers retire, they should be given retirement benefits according to the standards and allowed to take away their personal belongings as stipulated. Chronic patients may be given recuperation subsidies upon retirement, depending on their condition and length of service. Sergeants and soldiers who are disabled due to injury during their active service should have their disability level assessed upon retirement in accordance with the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Revolutionary Disabled Servicemen of the People's Republic of China, and be issued a certificate of revolutionary disabled serviceman and the disability allowance to which they are entitled.
    The regulations finally point out that when retired sergeants and soldiers arrive in their hometown counties and cities, the people's committees of their hometown counties and cities should organize welcomes, and the responsible cadres of the counties and cities should introduce them to the local situation and encourage them to settle down for production and work actively.
