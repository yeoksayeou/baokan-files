Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 7th: TASS reported that Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, wrote a letter to British philosopher Bertrand Russell on December 9, 1957, stating that in our era, the struggle for peace, for stopping the escalation of international tensions and the "Cold War" that could lead to enormous human catastrophe, and for the peaceful coexistence of countries, is the vital concern of people of all countries and all good people. He said that we advocate proving which system is superior not on the battlefield, but in the competition to achieve progress and improve people's living standards.

Khrushchev's letter was published in the British magazine "New Statesman" on December 21st last year and in the first issue of the Soviet magazine "International Life" this year. It was a reply to an open letter from Russell published in the British magazine "New Statesman" on November 23rd last year, addressed to Khrushchev and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In his letter, Russell requested the U.S. President and the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee to hold negotiations in order to be able to "frankly discuss the conditions for coexistence" and "seek to reach an agreement to eliminate future discord." Russell also talked about other international issues.

In his reply to Russell, Khrushchev said that your letter's basic idea—to save humanity from the threat of war using destructive weapons, to guarantee universal peace and prosperity on the basis of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, primarily by resolving Soviet-American relations—is understood by us, the Soviet people. The Soviet government and the Communist Party will now and in the future make every effort to stop the outbreak of a new war.

Khrushchev mentioned that the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed not deploying nuclear weapons outside the territories of countries that possess them, and specifically suggested that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union reach an agreement on not deploying nuclear weapons on the territories of West Germany and East Germany. He also mentioned the proposals put forward by Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic on establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe. Khrushchev said in the letter that socialist countries are making every effort to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, this has not yet received a positive response from Western countries. On the contrary, the other two countries possessing nuclear weapons—the United States and Britain—are taking every possible measure to drag their partners in the North Atlantic bloc deeper into the atomic arms race.

Khrushchev then pointed out that even if it is possible to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world, this will by no means eliminate the danger of nuclear war breaking out. The Soviet Union believes that the danger of atomic war can only be completely eliminated after the production and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons are universally prohibited, and the stockpiles of such weapons are destroyed. Khrushchev said that for almost twelve years, the Soviet government has insisted on solving the problem in this way and has put forward many concrete proposals to the United Nations aimed at achieving this goal. If Western countries show a sincere desire to eliminate the threat of atomic war, then steps can be taken tomorrow to immediately stop testing and renounce the use of nuclear weapons as a starting point for solving this problem, thereby making progress on the road to eliminating the threat of atomic war.

However, unfortunately, until now, we have not seen such a desire on the part of the U.S. government, as well as the governments of Britain and France. The problem lies in the fact that the groups that determine the policies of these countries hope to continue to have war in their arsenals as a means to achieve diplomatic goals.

Khrushchev expressed his agreement with a passage in Russell's letter, where Russell said, "The only need is: East and West recognize their mutual rights, recognize that both sides must learn to live side by side, and when trying to promote their own ideologies, be able to use arguments instead of force. It is not necessary for either side to abandon its belief in its own doctrines, it is only necessary for it to abandon the attempt to promote its beliefs by force."

Khrushchev said that he agrees with this passage because these words are fully in line with the Soviet Union's advocacy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, which has been the basis of its foreign policy since the first day of its founding.

Khrushchev also agreed with Russell's view that the abnormal U.S.-Soviet relations are one of the main reasons for the current international tension and the "Cold War."

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has been and is committed to improving relations with the United States in this way. We have taken many concrete steps in this regard. For example, in January 1956, the Soviet government proposed to the U.S. government to sign a U.S.-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. Our proposal is still valid.

Khrushchev went on to say that the leaders of the Soviet Union have always believed that direct contact with the leaders of other countries is an effective way to improve international relations. I fully support your suggestion for the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States to hold talks and frankly discuss the conditions for coexistence. The Soviet side has stated more than once that talks between high-level representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States would be of great benefit to both the Soviet Union and the United States and to the cause of world peace. We have absolutely no intention, and we do not want, to negotiate with the United States at the expense of the interests of any other country—whether it is a Western or Eastern country, a large or small country—or by worsening U.S. relations with any country. We advocate talks between Soviet and American leaders, but whether or not these talks can take place depends on the American leaders.

Khrushchev continued, undoubtedly, the cause of easing international tensions relies not only on the Soviet Union and the United States, but other countries, including Britain, should also contribute to this cause. Regrettably, it cannot be said that the current policy of the British government has been of any help in solving this important task. Turning the British Isles into a base for U.S. nuclear weapons and rocket weapons is of no benefit either to the cause of international peace or to Britain's own security.

It seems clear that Britain is playing almost the role of the main base for U.S. medium-range rockets in Europe. One might ask, who can believe that the latest weapons on the U.S. bases in Britain will not be used according to the instructions of the U.S. military command, without notifying the British people, parliament, or even the British government? Is it possible that a situation could arise where Britain could become an offensive base for launching a war against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries? Imagine, if due to some accident, for example, because an order was misunderstood, a lethal weapon of war was launched from a U.S. military base on British soil to attack a peace-loving country, a deadly retaliation would follow. In this case, the British people could suddenly be plunged into an atomic war, and the very existence of Britain would be threatened. Khrushchev said to Russell, please believe me, I am not saying this to scare your compatriots. I am saying this because I know the power of modern weapons of war.

As for the Soviet Union, it advocates joint efforts by all countries to ease international tensions. Both meetings between representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States and broader meetings between representatives of capitalist and socialist countries could contribute to this goal.

Khrushchev emphasized that today's world situation has become so serious that everyone who can contribute to reducing the danger of war and eliminating the threat of war should do their best. The louder the people of all countries raise their voices in the struggle for peace, the less chance the adherents of war adventures will have to launch a new war.

Khrushchev said to Russell, I believe that your call for the Soviet Union and the United States to work together to consolidate peace on the basis of peaceful coexistence will be echoed and supported by all those who cherish the interests of peace. My colleagues and I fully agree with this call and hope that your sincere desire to improve relations between countries will be supported by the leaders of other countries.

### 赫鲁晓夫发表公开信答复罗素  主张苏美会谈讨论共处条件  呼吁各国人民更加宏亮地发出和平呼声

    赫鲁晓夫发表公开信答复罗素
    主张苏美会谈讨论共处条件
    呼吁各国人民更加宏亮地发出和平呼声
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫1957年12月9日写信给英国哲学家罗素说，在我们的时代里，争取和平、争取停止加剧国际紧张局势和可能导致人类巨大灾难的“冷战”、争取各国和平共处的斗争，是世界各国人民、一切善良人们的切身事业。他说，我们主张，不是在战场上、而是在争取进步和提高人民生活水平的竞赛中证明到底哪一种制度较是优越的。
    赫鲁晓夫的这封信分别发表在去年12月21日英国“新政治家”杂志和今年第一期苏联“国际生活”杂志上。它是对罗素去年11月23日在英国“新政治家”杂志上发表的一封给赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔的公开信的答复。罗素在他的信中要求美国总统和苏共中央第一书记举行谈判，以便能够“坦率地讨论共处条件”和“寻求达成协议以消除未来的不和”。罗素还谈到了国际局势的其他问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在给罗素的复信中说，您的信的基本思想——拯救人类不受使用毁灭性武器的战争的威胁，在不同社会制度的国家和平共处的基础上，首先是通过解决苏美关系的途径来保证普遍和平和繁荣——是为我们苏联人民所理解的。苏联政府和共产党现在和将来都要尽一切努力来制止新战争的爆发。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到，苏联不止一次地建议不要在拥有核武器的国家的领土以外的地方配置核武器，还特别建议，美国、英国、苏联就不在西德和东德的领土上配置核武器的问题达成协议。他还谈到波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国提出的关于在欧洲建立无原子武器的地区的建议。赫鲁晓夫在信中说，社会主义国家在尽一切努力来防止核武器的进一步推广。遗憾的是，这在目前还没有得到西方国家的积极响应。相反地，其他两个拥有核武器的国家——美国和英国正在采取一切能够采取的措施，把自己的北大西洋集团的伙伴更深地拖入原子备战之中。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，即使能够防止核武器在世界上进一步推广，这也决不能消除爆发核战争的危险。苏联认为，只有原子武器和氢武器的生产和使用得到普遍禁止，并且把这类武器的储存销毁以后，原子战争的危险才能完全消除。赫鲁晓夫说，差不多十二年来，苏联政府一直坚持这样解决问题，并向联合国提出了不少旨在达到这一目的的具体建议。如果西方国家表现出消除原子战争威胁的真诚愿望，那么在明天就可以采取步骤立即停止试验和放弃使用核武器，作为解决这一问题的开端，从而在消除原子战争威胁的道路上有所进展。
    但是，遗憾的是直到现在为止，我们没有看到美国政府以及英国和法国政府有这种愿望。问题在于：决定这些国家的政策的集团希望在自己的武库中仍然拥有战争这样一种作为达到外交目的的手段。
    赫鲁晓夫表示他同意罗素在信中的一段话，罗素说，“唯一的需要就是：东方和西方承认它们的相互的权利，承认双方都必须学会同对方肩并肩地生活，并且在企图推广自己的意识形态的时候，能以论据代替武力。不需要某一方放弃对自己的学说的信念，只需要它放弃用武力推广自己的信念的企图。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，他之所以赞成这段话，是因为这些话完全符合苏联从立国的第一天起就作为外交政策基础的不同社会制度的国家和平共处的主张。
    赫鲁晓夫也同意罗素这样的看法：美苏关系不正常是造成目前国际紧张局势和“冷战”的主要原因之一。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联过去和现在一直致力于这样来改善同美国的关系。我们在这方面已经采取了不少具体步骤。例如，1956年1月苏联政府曾向美国政府建议签订一项美苏友好合作条约。我们的这一建议仍然有效。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联的领导人过去和现在一向认为同其他国家的国家领导人直接接触是改善国际关系的有效方法之一。我完全支持您提的关于要苏联和美国的领导人进行会谈并坦率讨论共处条件的建议。苏联方面曾不只一次地表示，苏联和美国的高级代表人物的会谈，无论对苏美两国或是对世界和平事业都会有极大的好处。我们根本不打算、而且也不愿意依靠牺牲任何其他国家——不论是西方国家或东方国家、大国或小国的利益，或是依靠恶化美国同任何国家的关系来同美国进行谈判。我们主张美苏领导人会谈，但是，能否进行会谈就要看美国领导人了。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，毫无疑问，缓和国际紧张局势的事业不仅有赖于苏联和美国，其他国家，其中当然包括英国，也应当对这一事业提供自己的贡献。很遗憾，不能说英国政府目前的政策对这一重要任务的解决有过什么帮助。把不列颠群岛变成美国核武器和火箭武器的基地，不论对国际和平事业或是对英国本身的安全都没有什么好处。
    看来很清楚，英国在欧洲几乎起着美国中程火箭的主要基地的作用。试问，谁能相信，在英国的美国基地上的最新式武器不会根据美国军事指挥部的指示，没有通知英国人民、议会，甚至没有通知英国政府就加以使用呢？是否会造成这样一种情况，即英国可能成为发动反对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的战争的进攻基地呢？请设想一下，如果由于某种意外，比如，因为命令被误解，从英国本土的美国军事基地上发出了致人死命的战争武器来进攻爱好和平的国家，致命的回击就将接踵而来。在这种情况下，英国人民就可能突然地陷入原子战争之中，连英国本身的存在都要受到威胁。赫鲁晓夫对罗素说，请相信，我这样说并不是要吓唬您的同胞。我之所以这样说，是因为我晓得现代战争武器的威力。
    至于苏联，它主张各国共同努力缓和国际紧张局势。无论是苏美两国代表的会见或是资本主义国家和社会主义国家代表的更广泛的会见都可能促成这个目的的实现。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，今天的世界局势已经严重到这种地步，以致凡是能够为减少战争危险和消除战争威胁出一把力的人都应该尽力为之。各国人民在争取和平的斗争中越是宏亮地发出自己的呼声，战争冒险的信奉者发动新战争的机会就越少。
    赫鲁晓夫对罗素说，我相信，您发出的要求苏美共同努力在和平共处的基础上巩固和平的呼吁，一定会得到一切珍视和平利益的人们的共鸣和支持。我的同事和我完全同意这个呼吁，并且希望您对改善各国相互关系的热诚愿望得到其他国家的领导人的支持。
