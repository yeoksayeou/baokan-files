    Expose Wasteful Phenomena, Discover Potential Strengths
    Zhejiang University Practices Economy in Managing Affairs

    (Reported by this newspaper) Zhejiang University, in the Rectification Movement, actively implemented the policy of running the university with diligence and thrift, achieving significant results.

    Regarding teaching equipment: Through thorough inspections by each department, various wasteful and stockpiling phenomena were exposed and criticized. After careful calculation, the costs of teaching equipment were greatly reduced. For example, the Department of Mechanical Engineering reduced its budget by 54,706 yuan, and the Department of Electrical Engineering reduced it by 32,691 yuan. This year, the university as a whole reduced teaching equipment and book expenses by more than 42%, totaling 474,672 yuan. Teachers also found ways to tap potential, combined with scientific research, and self-made some important experimental supplies. For example, the research group on hydraulic copying led by Associate Professor Ren Chuanfeng of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, manufactured a hydraulic copying machine suitable for lathes in the university's practice factory. In 1957, the practice factory also repaired and manufactured nine mechanical instruments for the university, totaling 705 pieces, self-made over 1,000 kilograms of welding rods, and turned over more than 10,000 yuan in funds. In addition, they processed parts for outside factories, saving the state more than 7,000 yuan. The mechanical instruments and scientific research equipment repaired and manufactured by the repair factory totaled 443 sets and tens of thousands of pieces, saving the state a huge amount of funds.

    Regarding capital construction: The principle of running the university with diligence and thrift, streamlining and saving, was also implemented. Except for the construction of necessary housing for teaching and living, the rest was greatly reduced. This year, a total of 600,000 yuan was reduced.

    Regarding people's scholarships, the university accepted students' reasonable criticisms and suggestions and corrected the past phenomena of being too high and too broad. A general review was conducted in the second, third, and fourth grades, which not only made it reasonable but also reduced the state's monthly expenditure by 3,910 yuan, saving the state 46,925 yuan a year.

    Currently, the leadership of Zhejiang University will further follow the spirit of the recent instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education, combine rectification and reform, mobilize the masses, deeply implement the policy of building the country and running the university with diligence and thrift, save more manpower and material resources to support industrial and agricultural construction, and cultivate a good style of study of diligence, thrift, and hard work.

    揭发浪费现象　发掘潜在力量
    浙江大学精打细算办事情
    本报讯　浙江大学在整风运动中，积极贯彻勤俭办学方针，取得了很大成果。
    在教学设备方面：由于各系通过深入检查，揭发批判了各种浪费、积压现象。经过精打细算，大大削减了教学设备费用。如机械系就核减了五万四千七百零六元，电机系核减了三万二千六百九十一元。今年全校教学设备和图书费用共核减了42％以上，计四十七万四千六百七十二元。经教师们找窍门、挖潜力结合科学研究，还自制一些重要实验用品。如机械系任传丰副教授等组成的液压靠模的科研小组，就制造了一架适用于本校实习工厂车床上的液压靠模机。在1957年中，实习工厂还为本校修造了机械仪器九部，计七百零五件，自制电焊条一千余斤，上缴资金一万余元，此外替外面工厂加工零件，为国家节约七千多元。修造工厂修造的机械仪器、科研用具等，就有四百四十三套、二万几千件，为国家节约了巨量资金。
    在基本建设方面：也贯彻了勤俭办学精简节约的原则，除了满足教学和生活必需用房的兴建外，其余都大大削减，今年共削减了六十万元。
    在人民助学金方面，学校接受了同学们合理的批评建议，纠正了过去偏高偏宽的现象。在二、三、四年级普遍进行了复查，不仅做到合理，而且每月可减少国家支出三千九百一十元，一年可为国家节约四万六千九百二十五元。
    现在，浙江大学领导上，还将进一步按照高等教育部最近指示精神，结合整改，发动群众，深入贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针，节省更多的人力物力支援工农业建设，并养成勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的良好学风。　（弓人）
