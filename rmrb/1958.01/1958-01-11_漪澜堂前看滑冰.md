Watching Skating in front of Yilan Hall
Tian Ming

　　Winter in Beihai Park is not as crowded as in other seasons. In the large park, it seems a bit quiet. But when you walk to the skating rink in front of Yilan Hall, you will see a lively scene. Especially at night, when everything around is quiet, the strong lights on the skating rink illuminate the entire ice surface with a silvery white glow, bustling with activity and a constant stream of people.

　　The ice rink has only been open for a short time, but more than a thousand people come to skate every day from 8:30 in the morning to 9:00 in the evening. The 24,000 square meters of ice surface are filled with people. There are men, women, children of six or seven years old, and middle-aged people in their thirties and forties. Some skate easily and freely, while others struggle like toddlers taking their first steps.

　　On the 400-meter-long track around the rink, one person follows another, forming a moving wall of people. Several young men wearing speed skates dart back and forth through the crowd like butterflies flitting through flowers. Many people who are not very skilled quickly move aside when they see them coming, afraid of being knocked over. But that is an unnecessary worry.

　　In the middle of the human wall is the figure skating area, where many people practice figure skating moves such as figure eights, figure threes, brackets, and hook shapes. A young woman, while skating, suddenly performed a beautiful Ina Bauer, a graceful pose that immediately attracted people's attention. It seems that these people are all ice sports masters.

　　The northeast side of the rink is the activity area for children and beginners. Every scene here is fascinating. Many children fly across the ice, making the adults who are just learning to skate endlessly envious. A female comrade is walking slowly while holding onto an ice cart, always wanting to let go of the extra support, but as soon as she lets go, she falls with a "plop." She has to pick herself up and hold onto it again. The crutch cannot be discarded until the time is right. Several soldiers with southern accents are carefully walking hand in hand. It seems that they are probably on the ice rink for the first time. Suddenly, one of them falls, bringing the other two down with him, and a burst of light laughter erupts around them. Probably falling is a common occurrence, they pat the ice off their bodies and start skating again.

　　In the northern part of the ice rink, a small area has been set aside. There are two small wooden goals that resemble soccer goals. That is the ice hockey rink. Several young men are practicing shooting there. Soon, twelve people gather on the rink. They divide into two sides and start a game. Watching ice hockey is perhaps more interesting than watching speed skating and figure skating, and people immediately gather around. The young men's speed, sharp turns, and accurate shots are amazing.

　　There are many people skating on the rink, and there are also many people watching from outside the rink. A row of kindergarten children are standing outside the rink fence, and when they see children about the same age as them speeding around on the rink, how can they not be moved? Some watch intently, while others keep telling their teacher, "I want to skate too." (Attached picture)

    漪澜堂前看滑冰
    天铭
    冬日的北海公园里，已不似其他季节那样人涌如流。在偌大的园子里，显得有点清静。可是当你走到漪澜堂前的滑冰场时，就会看到一番热闹景象。尤其是晚上，四周都已寂静下来，而滑冰场上，强烈的灯光把整个冰场照得一片银白，熙熙攘攘，人流不绝。
    冰场开放不多久，可是，每天从早上八点半到晚九点，前来滑冰的总有一千多人。二万四千多平方公尺的冰面上，到处是人。这里有男的，有女的，有六、七岁的儿童，有三、四十岁的中年。他们有的溜得轻松自如，有的还像初学走步的孩子那样步履艰难。
    在周围四百公尺的跑道上，一个人接着一个人，成了一道流动着的人的围墙。几个穿跑刀鞋的小伙子，飞快地在人流中穿来插去，就像穿花蝴蝶一样。很多技术不太熟练的人看到他们过来，连忙躲在一旁，就怕把自己碰倒。其实那是多余的顾虑。
    在人墙的中间是花样滑冰区，很多人在那里练习8字形、3字形、括弧形、钩手形等花样动作。一个青年姑娘，滑着滑着，忽然来了个燕式平衡，这一个美妙的姿势，立刻吸引了人们的注意。看来他们这些人都是冰上运动的健将。
    场子的东北面是儿童们和初学者的活动范围。这里的每一个场面都是引人入胜的。很多小朋友在冰上来去如飞，令那些初学溜冰的大人羡慕不止。一个女同志扶着冰车蹒跚地走着，她老是想把那多余的东西丢掉，可是刚一放手，就是噗咚一交。她起来还得再扶着它。没到火候，拐棍是不能丢的。几个操南方口音的战士，小心地手拉手在走步。看样子，大概是初次上冰场。忽然间，一个摔倒了，把其他的两个也带倒了，四围发出一阵轻笑声。大概摔交是常事，他们拍拍身上的冰花，又开始滑了起来。
    在冰场的北部，辟出一块小天地。那里安有两个足球门似的小木门。那就是冰球场。几个年青小伙子在那里练习射门。不一会场上凑够了十二个人。他们分开两边比赛了。看冰球或许比看速度滑冰和花样滑冰更有意思，人们立刻都围了过去。小伙子们打起球来，那惊人的速度，急遽的转弯，准确的射门，使人惊叹不已。
    在场上溜的人很多，在场外边看的人也不少。在冰场栏干外面围了一排幼儿园的小朋友，当他们看到同他们差不多的孩子在场上驰骋时，怎么会不为之心动。他们有的看得出神，有的不断地跟老师说：“我也要滑冰。”（附图片）
