    Villages and Communes Building Schools, Every Household Hears the Sound of Reading
    -- A Record of Mass Education in Wushan County
    By Our Correspondent Gu Lei
    In Wushan County, Gansu Province, a gratifying atmosphere of rural cultural prosperity has emerged: primary school education has been basically popularized. The county has 172 primary schools (including higher primary and lower primary), with 24,839 students. Excluding children over the school age, the number of school-age children enrolled is 20,699, accounting for 81% of the total number of school-age children. The farmers proudly say: "Our county has schools in every village and commune, and students in every household!"
    Now, under the encouragement of the "National Program for Agricultural Development," the county has put forward a resounding slogan: to achieve universal primary education in 1958.
    Before liberation, only 6,329 children attended school in Wushan County. By 1953, the number of students was only 7,416, accounting for only 18% of the total number of school-age children. So, in just a few years, why has primary school education in Wushan County developed so rapidly? What kind of path have they taken? These questions can be answered in one sentence: it is the result of relying on the masses to run schools.
    Here are a few figures: Currently, there are 172 primary schools in the county, of which 124 are run by the masses; there are 24,839 students in school, and 13,185 are in people-run primary schools, more than 50%; according to this year's statistics, the county's expenditure on primary schools is 426,000 yuan, of which 233,000 yuan is borne by the masses, accounting for more than half.
    Relying on the Masses
    Relying on the masses to run schools is not an easy task. This is a struggle. The main issue in this struggle is to solve two problems in leadership thinking: one, whether to understand and sincerely sympathize with the farmers' urgent desire for their children to attend school; and the other, whether to believe that the power of the masses can run schools well.
    Farmers feel that being uneducated is painful. In Yanan Township, far from the county seat, few people went to school in the past. After liberation, during the land reform, when the township sent documents to the villages, the village chief had to look around for someone to read them, and often things were delayed because he couldn't find anyone. One village cadre received seven notices one night, and used a burning broom as a lamp, running back and forth seven times, burning seven brooms, before he could understand the contents of each notice. The farmers said: "In the old society, we couldn't go to school. Now we have difficulties everywhere. We can't let our children suffer this again!" Therefore, as early as 1953, farmers were asking the county to approve their schools.
    At that time, it was the height of the educational policy of "consolidation and rectification, key development, steady progress, and improved quality." In addition, the leaders of Wushan County were afraid that mass-run schools would be difficult to consolidate, so they did not fully encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to run schools, and even stipulated that "mass-run schools must be approved by the township people's congress and guarantee that there are funds to supply the school for more than three years before the county can approve them." By 1954, under the pressure of the masses' enthusiasm for running schools, the county approved one complete primary school and seven junior primary schools run by the masses. Until 1955, they still did not dare to develop boldly, and approved two more complete primary schools and seventeen junior primary schools. In short, due to right-leaning conservatism in thinking, the hands and feet of the masses enthusiastic about running schools were tied.
    In 1956, there were sixteen complete primary schools and one hundred junior primary schools run by the masses. There are four factors for such rapid development. First, this year was a year of great leap forward in agricultural cooperation, and the right-leaning conservative thinking of the leadership was opposed; second, the farmers' desire for their children to attend school was even stronger than in the past, and the leadership had to reconsider this issue; third, the economic situation of the farmers had improved greatly, and they had the ability to run schools; fourth, the county leadership saw from the activities of the schools that had already been established that the masses could not only run schools, but also run them well.
    From then on, the leaders of Wushan County clearly established the idea of relying on the masses to run schools, carried out a comprehensive plan for the development of primary school education, publicized the conditions and benefits of mass-run schools, called on farmers to actively run schools, and strengthened the business leadership of people-run primary schools. At the same time, the authority to run schools was decentralized: (1) As long as there are conditions for running schools and the masses voluntarily run schools, the township people's congress can discuss and approve it, and then report it to the county for the record; (2) The selection and dismissal of teachers shall be handled by the township government, the school board or the school management committee; (3) The school building plan can be discussed by the masses, and the county only provides business guidance.
    Thrifty School Management
    The Wushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wushan County People's Committee put forward the policy of thrift in running schools: to be thrifty in basic construction, to spend less money and get more done; the equipment in schools should be simple and crude, and it is enough to ensure learning, and there is no need to pursue complete and new sets; the salaries of teachers can be adapted to people, communes, and local conditions, and should not be too high. It is necessary to run schools hard, and teachers should share weal and woe with commune members.
    The introduction of this policy greatly accelerated the development of primary school education. Farmers used all available houses, such as temples, ancestral halls, and public houses. Where there were no houses available, the masses built them themselves. When Yangjiagou Village ran a junior primary school, the farmers automatically donated rafters, burned bricks, chopped firewood, and provided labor. A classroom that could accommodate sixty students was built, and only nine yuan was spent on buying nails and hemp stalks. The equipment in many schools is very simple. Many primary schools use adobe and wooden boards to build desks and teaching desks. Without blackboards, they use plaques, doors, and offering tables from temples instead, or brush a layer of red clay on the wall. Some students bring their stools to school and take them home after school. Some desks and stools are temporarily borrowed from farmers. According to a survey of 2,882 desks and stools, 290 were borrowed, 1,050 were made by the masses with donated materials, and 542 were made of earth platforms and wooden boards. The masses said: "We spend less money and get more done, and we do things even if we don't spend money. Anyway, we want our children to go to school."
    It is precisely because the masses have implemented the policy of thrift in running schools that many things are done more economically than in public primary schools. According to a survey by the Education Section of the County People's Committee, there are several aspects of comparison: it costs at least 2,700 yuan for a public primary school to build a classroom (capacity 120 people), but it costs less than 1,000 yuan for the masses to build; each set of desks and stools in public primary schools costs an average of 18 yuan, while each set of desks and stools made by the masses costs no more than 10 yuan; the average salary of teachers in public primary schools is 46 yuan, while the average salary of teachers in people-run primary schools is 25 yuan. Overall, the investment in mass-run schools is more than one-half less than the investment in public primary schools.
    Sources of Funding
    The forms of mass-run schools in Wushan County are diverse, and the fundraising methods are also different. The salary payment methods for teachers are not uniform either.
    There are three forms of mass-run schools.
    The first is completely run by the masses. The basic construction, teaching equipment, hiring of teachers, and teachers' salaries are all borne by the masses. The government only helps solve some teacher problems. This form of school is mostly in relatively wealthy areas, with 94 in the county, accounting for the vast majority.
    The second is people-run with public assistance. The basic construction and teaching equipment are all funded by the masses, and the government only subsidizes a small portion of the teachers' salaries. For example, among the 98 teachers in 16 complete primary schools, 61 are subsidized by the government.
    The third is publicly run with people's assistance. The basic construction and teaching equipment are built with state funds, and the masses only pay part of the teachers' salaries. For example, among the 74 teachers in the 31 public junior primary schools, 33 are paid by the masses.
    Adopting various forms of mass-run schools can concentrate more financial and material resources, and absorb more children into school from many aspects, such as increasing schools and expanding classes.
    In people-run primary schools, there are also various ways to raise various economic expenditures. The basic construction of the school (including houses and equipment) is mostly built by the masses donating labor, materials, and money, or by the cooperative subsidizing a portion at a time. There are three ways to source the school's regular expenses (including teachers' salaries and tuition fees): First, charge tuition fees. Generally, junior primary school students pay 3 yuan per year, and higher primary school students pay 4 yuan per year. Those with good family economic conditions pay in full at one time, and those with financial difficulties pay in installments or for free. The tuition fee standard is lower than that of public primary schools. The second is to pay from the public welfare fund of the agricultural cooperative. The third is that the cooperative leaves a little land for the school, and the teachers lead the students to participate in labor, grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise sheep, or the teachers lead the students to chop firewood and collect grain, etc., to increase some economic income.
    Regarding the payment of teachers' salaries, after discussion by the masses, three payment methods are adopted. The first is to record workdays. This is suitable for teachers whose families are local and for cooperatives with financial difficulties. The scoring standard is the same as that of the best labor force in the cooperative. If the teacher particularly needs cash, they can temporarily borrow a small amount from the cooperative. The second is to pay all in cash. This is suitable for cooperatives with economic crops and more sideline income, and also takes care of the problem of out-of-town teachers supporting their families. The third is half cash and half workdays. This method was decided by the cooperative and the teacher after mutual consultation and taking care of each other's difficulties. Regardless of which of the above three forms, the teacher's salary is not higher than the income of the strongest labor force in the local area, so as not to increase the burden on farmers and cooperatives.
    Improving Quality
    It is wrong to subjectively think that mass-run schools cannot be run well; however, it is also wrong not to pay special attention to helping these schools improve the quality of teaching. People-run schools have weaknesses, such as being too scattered and difficult to lead, and the quality of teachers is low. According to a survey of the educational level of 209 teachers at the end of last year, 74 had junior high school or above, 110 had higher primary school, and 25 had lower primary school. Many people lack teaching experience. At the same time, some teachers are emotional because their wages are lower than those of public primary school teachers, and some are not at ease with their work due to political treatment and other issues. The leaders of Wushan County, in response to this situation, carried out the following work to ensure the quality of teaching.
    The first is to strengthen the ideological education of teachers. On the one hand, it is explained that they are entrusted by the masses, and it is glorious to educate the second generation. On the other hand, it also explains that under the current situation where the living standards of farmers are still relatively low, they should share weal and woe with the farmers, and it is impractical to have excessive demands. After such education, many people improved their work enthusiasm.
    Second, solve some specific problems that are not treated equally. For example, in the past, only teachers in public primary schools were allowed to organize political study classes and issue teacher badges, but not teachers in people-run primary schools. This incident caused many teachers to be emotionally agitated. Later, the county thoroughly resolved these issues, absorbing them to participate in political study, issuing badges, and electing outstanding model teachers, etc., all treated equally, making many teachers feel that working in people-run primary schools is also glorious.
    The third is to strengthen the leadership and assistance of teaching business. In addition to running three training courses during the summer vacation, the county also established a guidance network. Eighteen guidance areas were established with the public complete primary school as the center, and experienced teachers from the public primary school conducted regular guidance work.
    Because the above-mentioned work was carried out, the quality of teaching was guaranteed. For example, the best school in the county (including good student learning performance, good discipline, and good teacher unity) is the complete primary school run by the masses in Dongshun Township. Judging from the exam scores, the students who graduated from Nanshan Complete Primary School ranked first when taking the Tannanch Middle School exam. This shows that as long as the work is done, it is completely possible to guarantee the quality of teaching.
    Worthy of Learning
    Wushan County, through mass-run schools, can accelerate the speed of popularizing education in the case that the state cannot make large investments in this area. This year will be the year when primary school education is popularized in Wushan County, four to five years ahead of the original plan. It can be imagined that if Wushan County did not rely on the masses to run schools, but only reached out to the state for money, it would be impossible to increase 124 primary schools in a short period of time. If all counties in the country learn from Wushan County's approach, and primary school education reaches the existing level of Wushan County, then the country can realize the task of popularizing primary school education ahead of schedule.
    In the schools run by the masses in Wushan County, it is more conducive to carrying out labor education for children. Many schools not only mobilize students to help agricultural cooperatives or families with labor during the busy farming season, but also mobilize students to participate in labor such as growing vegetables, chopping firewood, and raising pigs in order to solve some of the school's economic problems. Children are often in a working environment and in an atmosphere of diligence and thrift, which enables children to establish the view that labor is glorious.
    Mass-run schools in Wushan County quickly change the unbalanced development of schools in rural areas, shorten the radius of schools, and facilitate students to attend school nearby. Before 1954, seven of the eleven complete primary schools in the county were along the railway line, and there were none in the remote mountainous areas. 50% of the 53 junior primary schools were in the river areas, and there were also few in the mountainous areas. In the past, the radius of a complete primary school was 15 li, and the average radius of a junior primary school was 20 to 30 li. This situation made it impossible for many children to attend school because there were no schools or they were too far away from the school. Now, the distribution of schools is basically balanced, and the radius of schools is between 2 and 5 li, which greatly facilitates children's enrollment. This is an important condition for improving the enrollment rate of school-age children, and because most students are day students, it saves investment in housing construction.
    Of course, Wushan County's experience in mobilizing the masses to run schools is not yet perfect, and there are still many problems that need to be studied and solved in the future, such as the unbalanced economic burden. However, this does not affect the development of this work. The road of mass-run schools has been opened up by the people of Wushan County. It is hoped that all places will also embark on this road and move forward like Wushan!

    村村社社建学校　家家户户读书声
    ——记武山县群众办学
    本报记者　顾雷
    甘肃省武山县出现了令人欣喜的农村文化繁荣的气象：小学教育基本上已经普及了。全县有小学校（包括高小和初小）一百七十二所，学生二万四千八百三十九人，其中除去超学龄的儿童，入学的学龄儿童是二万零六百九十九人，占学龄儿童总数的81％。农民们自豪地说：“我们县是村村社社有学校，家家户户有学生了！”
    现在，全县在“全国农业发展纲要”的鼓舞下，又提出一个响亮的口号：1958年实现普及小学教育。
    解放以前，武山县入学儿童只有六千三百二十九人。到1953年，学生人数不过七千四百十六人，只占学龄儿童总数的18％。那么，在短短的几年内，武山县的小学教育为什么会发展的这样快呢？他们走的是一条什么样的道路呢？这些问题可以一语道破：就是依靠群众办学的结果。
    有这样几个数字：现在全县有小学一百七十二所，其中有一百二十四所是群众办的；在校学生二万四千八百三十九人，民办小学的学生是一万三千一百八十五人，50％以上；据今年统计，全县开支小学经费四十二万六千元，其中由群众负担的是二十三万三千元，占一半以上。
    依靠群众
    依靠群众办学，不是一件轻而易举的事。这是一场斗争。在这个斗争中主要是解决领导思想上的两个问题，一个，是不是了解与衷心同情农民迫切希望子女上学的要求；另一个，是不是相信群众的力量可以把学办好。
    农民觉得没有文化是痛苦的。离县城很远的延安乡，过去很少有人上学。解放以后土地改革时，乡里往村里送文件，村长得四处找人念，往往因找不到人把事情耽误了。有一位村干部，一天夜里接到七个通知，便用火点上扫帚当灯，跑了七次，烧了七把扫帚，才弄清楚各个通知的内容。农民们说：“在旧社会，咱上不了学，现在处处有困难，以后再不能叫孩子们再受这个罪了！”因此，远在1953年，农民就纷纷要求县上批准他们办学。
    这时，正赶上教育上“整顿巩固，重点发展，稳步前进，提高质量”的风头；加上武山县领导上怕群众办学难以巩固，就未能充分鼓励群众办学的热情，而且还规定：“群众办学要经乡人民代表大会通过，保证有能供给学校三年以上的经费，县上才能批准。”到1954年，在群众办学热情的压力下，全县才批准了一处群众办完小、七处初小。直至1955年，仍然不敢大胆发展，又批准了两处完小、十七处初小。总之，由于思想上的右倾保守，把群众热心办学的手脚捆住了。
    1956年，群众办的完小有十六处，初小有一百处。所以发展这样快，有四个因素。第一，这一年是农业合作化大跃进的一年，反对了领导上的右倾保守思想；第二，农民要求子女入学的愿望，比过去更强烈了，领导上不能不重新考虑这个问题；第三，农民的经济状况已有很大改善，有了办学的能力；第四，县的领导从已办的小学活动中，看到了群众不但可以办学，而且可以办好。
    从此，武山县的领导，明确树立了依靠群众办学的思想，进行了发展小学教育的全面规划，宣传群众办学的条件和好处，号召农民积极办学，加强对民办小学的业务领导。同时，下放了办学的权限：（一）只要有办学条件，群众自愿办学，乡人代会可以讨论批准，而后报县备案；（二）教师的选用和解聘，由乡政府或校董会或学校管理委员会全权处理；（三）建校计划等由群众讨论即可，县上只作业务指导。
    勤俭办学
    中共武山县委、武山县人民委员会提出了勤俭办学的方针：基本建设时要勤俭，少花钱多办事；学校中的设备要因陋就简，能保证学习即可，不要追求成套的、新的；教师的工资，可因人、因社、因地制宜，不要太高，要艰苦办学，教员要同社员同甘苦、共呼吸。
    这个方针的提出，大大加快了小学教育的发展。农民把庙宇、祠堂、公房等一切可以利用的房屋，都加以利用了。没有房屋可利用的地方，群众动手盖。杨家沟村办初级小学时，农民自动献椽木、烧砖、打柴、出工。盖了一所可容纳六十个学生的教室，只花了九元钱买钉子、麻杆。许多学校里的设备是十分简单的。有不少的小学，用土坯加木板搭成桌子和教桌。没有黑板，用庙里的匾、门扇、供桌代替，或者在墙上刷一层红粘土。有的学生，上学时把凳子带上，下学时再带着回家。有些桌凳是暂时借用农民的。根据对二千八百八十二件桌凳的调查，其中借用的二百九十件，群众捐料自做的一千零五十件，用土台和木板搭成的五百四十二件。群众说：“我们是少花钱多办事，不花钱也办事，反正是要叫孩子上学。”
    正由于群众贯彻了勤俭办学的方针，许多事情办得比公立小学节省。根据县人民委员会教育科的调查，有这样几个方面的对比：公立小学修一座教室（容一百二十人）最低需二千七百元，群众修要不了一千元；公立小学每套桌凳平均十八元，群众做桌凳每套不超过十元；公立小学教师的工资平均四十六元，民办小学教师工资平均二十五元。总起来看，群众办学的投资，要比公立小学的投资少二分之一以上。
    经费来源
    武山县群众办学的形式是多种多样的，集资的方法也各有不同，教师的工资支付办法也不是统一的。
    群众办学有三种形式。
    第一种，完全由群众办。基本建设、教学设备、聘请教师和教师的工资，全部由群众负担，公家只帮助解决部分教师问题。这种形式的学校，大都在较富裕的地区，全县有九十四处，占绝大部分。
    第二种，民办公助。基本建设、教学设备全由群众出资，公家只补助少部分教师的工资。如在十六所完小的九十八个教师中，由公家补助的有六十一个。
    第三种，公办民助。基本建设、教学设备由国家出钱建设，群众只出部分教师的工资。如公立的三十一所初级小学中七十四个教师，由群众负担工资的有三十三人。
    采用多种群众办学的形式，就可以集中更多的财力、物力，从许多方面，如增加学校、扩大班级等方面吸收更多的儿童入学。
    民办小学中，各种经济开支的筹措方法，也是多种多样的。学校的基本建设（包括房屋、设备），大都由群众献工、献材、献钱，或由合作社补助一部分一次建成。学校中的经常费用（包括教师工资和学杂费等）来源，有三种办法：第一，收学费。一般的初小学生每年收三元，高小学生每年收四元，家庭经济情况好的一次交清，经济困难的分期交或者免费。学费标准，都比公立小学低。第二种，由农业社公益金中出。第三种，社内给学校留一点地，由教师带领学生参加劳动，种菜、养猪、养羊，或者由教师带学生去打柴、拾粮食等，增加部分经济收入。
    对于教师工资的支付，经过群众讨论，采用三种支付办法。第一种，记劳动日。这适用于家在本地的教师和经济较困难的社。记分标准和社内最好的劳动力一样。教师如特别需要现金，可暂时向合作社借一小部分用。第二种，全部支付现金。这适用于经济作物、副业收入多的社，也照顾外来教师养家的问题。第三种，一半现金、一半劳动日。这个办法，是社和教师在互相商量、照顾双方困难的时候定下来的。以上三种形式，不管是那一种，教师的工资都不高于当地最强的劳动力的收入，以免加重农民和合作社的负担。
    提高质量
    主观认为群众办学办不好是不对的；但是，不特别注意帮助这些学校提高教学质量也是不对的。群众办的学校是有弱点的，如太分散不易领导，教师质量低等。据去年底对二百零九个教师文化程度的调查，初中以上的七十四人，高小的一百一十人，高小以下的二十五人。有很多人缺乏教学经验。同时，还有的教师，因为工薪比公立小学教师低而闹情绪，还有的因政治待遇等问题而不安心工作。武山县的领导针对这种情况，进行了下列工作来保证教学质量。
    首先是加强教师的思想教育。一方面，说明他们受到群众委托，教育第二代是光荣的。另一方面，也说明在目前农民生活水平还比较低的情况下，应该同农民同甘共苦，如果有过高的要求是不实际的。经过这样的教育，许多人提高了工作热情。
    其次，解决一些不是一视同仁的具体问题。例如，过去组织政治学习班、发教师证章等，只有公立小学教师的份，没有民办小学教师的事。此事曾引起很多教师情绪波动。后来，县里彻底地解决了这些问题，吸收他们参加政治学习，发给证章，选举优秀模范教师等，都一视同仁，使许多教师感到在民办小学里工作，也是光荣的。
    再就是加强教学业务的领导和辅助。除了在暑假期间办了三次训练班外，全县又建立了辅导网。以公立完全小学为中心成立了十八个辅导区，由公立小学有经验的教师进行定期的辅导工作。
    由于进行了上列工作，就保证了教学质量。例如，全县最好的学校（包括学生学习成绩好、纪律好、教师团结好），是东顺乡群众办的完全小学。从考试成绩看，南山完小毕业的学生考滩南中学时是第一名。这说明，只要工作做到了，是完全可以保证教学质量的。
    值得学习
    武山县通过群众办学，可以在国家不可能在这方面进行较大投资的情况下，加快普及教育的速度。今年将是武山县小学教育普及的一年，比原计划提前四年到五年。可以设想，如果武山县不是依靠群众办学，而只是伸手向国家要钱，想在短期内增加一百二十四所小学是不可能的。如果全国各个县都学习武山县的做法，小学教育都达到武山县的现有水平，那末全国就可以提前实现小学教育普及化的任务。
    武山县群众办的学校里，更有利于对儿童进行劳动教育。许多学校不仅在农忙时动员学生帮助农业社或家庭劳动，为了解决学校部分经济问题，还发动学生参加种菜、打柴、养猪等劳动。儿童经常处于劳动的环境中，经常处在勤俭的生活气氛中，使儿童能树立劳动光荣的观点。
    武山县群众办学，在农村中迅速改变学校发展不平衡的状况，缩短学校的半径，便利学生走读。1954年以前，全县十一所完小有七所在铁路沿线，边远的山区根本没有，五十三所初小50％在河川地区，山区也很少。过去完小的半径是十五华里，初小的平均半径是二十至三十华里。这种情况，使许多儿童因没有学校或离学校太远不能入学。现在，学校分布基本平衡，学校半径均在二到五华里之间，大大方便了儿童入学，这是提高学龄儿童入学率不可少的一个重要的条件，而且由于大部分学生是走读，节省了房屋建设的投资。
    当然，武山县发动群众办学的经验还不十分完备，尚有许多问题有待今后研究解决，如经济负担不平衡等。但是，这并不影响这一工作的开展。群众办学这条路，是被武山县的人民打通了，希望所有地方也都走上这条路，而且像武山一样大步前进！
