Building Roads into the Deep Mountains

    (From Our Correspondent) Hubei Provincial Highway Department, in accordance with the needs of economic development in mountainous areas, has decided to build 489 kilometers of new highways in 1958, of which more than 80% will be in the mountainous areas of western and northern Hubei.

    The two major mountain trunk lines in western Hubei, from Yidu to Laifeng, and in northern Hubei, from Nanzhang to Zhushan, will have sections completed in 1958. The abundant local specialties that could not be transported out of these mountainous areas in the past will be continuously transported to the cities along the highways. Construction has already started on parts of these two trunk lines. In Hecheng and Laifeng alone, there are more than 10,000 migrant workers enthusiastically building roads. Seven highway branch lines with heavy transportation tasks, including Hongan to Yangluo, Suixian to Hongshan, Nanzhang to Yicheng, Jingmen to Shayang, Zaoshi to Zhongxiang, Dangyang to Yuan'an, and Yingcheng to Sanyangdian, will also be improved in 1958. After these routes are improved, they will be passable in all weather conditions.

    In addition, Hubei Province also plans to build 142.5 kilometers of large-vehicle roads in mountainous areas in 1958.

    把公路修进深山
    本报讯　湖北省公路厅根据山区经济发展的需要，决定1958年新建公路四百八十九公里，其中80％以上在鄂西、鄂北大山区。
    鄂西从宜都至来凤和鄂北从南漳至竹山的两条山区干线，1958年将修通一部分。过去这些山区无法运出的丰富的土特产，将沿公路源源不断运往城市。目前以上两条干线，已经局部开工。仅鹤峰和来凤境内就有一万多民工在热火朝天地修路。红安至阳逻、随县至洪山、南漳至宜城、荆门至沙洋、皂市至锺祥、当阳至远安、应城至三阳店等七条运输任务繁重的公路支线，1958年也将进行改善。这些路线改善以后，可以晴雨通车。
    此外，湖北省在1958年还准备兴建山区大车道一百四十二点五公里。
