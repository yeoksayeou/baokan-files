(Reported by Liberation Daily) The Mei Lin Canned Food Factory, based on significant achievements in focused rectification, the leadership again expressed its determination to "ignite fire on themselves," mobilizing all factory workers to launch a heated "speaking out" campaign on the special topic of anti-waste. In just three or four days, workers posted over 300 big-character posters, sharply criticizing the factory's waste over the past few years and the lack of a spirit of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift among leading cadres. Preliminary estimates based on revealed materials suggest that since 1954, the factory has wasted approximately 450,000 yuan in raw materials, property, supplies, quality accidents, and labor, accounting for about half of the factory's existing working capital.

One big-character poster revealed that the factory's losses from swollen (spoiled) canned goods alone amounted to over 51,800 yuan between 1956 and 1957. The Production Technology Section revealed that losses from defective products from January to November 1957 amounted to over 9,600 yuan. Another material revealed that in 1956 alone, 61 accidents such as canned goods bursting (cracking) and leaky cans resulted in losses of over 32,500 yuan according to factory cost calculations.

Waste of raw materials was also very serious. In the third quarter of 1955, during the production of pineapple cans, poor storage resulted in the loss of over 180,000 jin, totaling over 49,000 yuan. In the summer of 1957, poor storage also caused over 10,000 kilograms of apricots to rot, resulting in a loss of over 5,000 yuan; spoiled pig knuckles resulted in a loss of over 1,100 yuan. Lax quality inspection of ducks forced them to be sold at a reduced price, and the devaluation of just 12,000 jin of ducks resulted in a loss of approximately 5,000 yuan.

Due to improper estimation and arrangement of production plans within the factory, sometimes blindly recruiting temporary workers also resulted in a large waste of labor. Big-character posters in the food workshop revealed that from January to November 1957, a waste of over 12,800 workdays occurred. Waste in labor use in 1956 alone amounted to over 20,000 yuan.

Big-character posters also criticized the factory for not considering the needs of 600 million people when running welfare programs, but rather being extravagant. The factory already had bathrooms and kitchens, and only needed minor repairs or appropriate expansion, but instead spent over 27,000 yuan to build new bathrooms and kitchens. Workers wrote a doggerel titled "Basic Construction is Very Wasteful, When Will the Bourgeois Bathrooms Open?" criticizing this waste phenomenon. In addition, the factory and Mei Lin Ranch jointly built a ball field for 2,000 yuan, and although few people played ball in the evening, it was equipped with excellent lighting equipment.

Workers criticized the leadership for being indifferent to these waste phenomena, lacking "the heartache of losing one yuan themselves," and adopting a bureaucratic attitude of turning a blind eye. For example, the problem of canned goods "swelling," which occurred frequently, was not actively addressed by the leadership by organizing technical personnel to research improvements, but was instead considered normal, and even thought that "swelling" was common in other brother factories, so they did not pay attention to it.

Through the powerful criticism of the masses, the factory's leading cadres began to deeply realize how much damage it would cause to the enterprise and the country if they, as enterprise leaders, did not establish the idea of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and did not change their bureaucratic and subjective style. Therefore, they are determined to continue to deeply mobilize the masses to further comprehensively expose waste, dig out the root causes, find solutions, so as to rely on the masses to formulate practical and feasible rectification plans to correct and prevent waste.

(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th) Workers of Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 17, focusing on checking the policy of running enterprises with diligence and thrift, have launched a new upsurge of "speaking out," further exposing serious waste in enterprises. In recent days, the masses have put forward more than 1,000 opinions exposing waste. Many big-character posters, based on the spirit of presenting facts and reasoning, have sharply criticized the leadership for not well implementing the policy of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and some even hung physical objects in front of the big-character posters as evidence.

Judging from the facts revealed in the symposiums and big-character posters, the waste in the enterprise is enormous. For example, a cadre of the Supply Section revealed that 19 fine spinning machines’ carriages and other parts were made but the Conservation Section did not carefully examine the drawings, and only after the parts were made did they realize that the drawings were wrong, rendering the parts worth more than 8,000 yuan unusable. Another big-character poster entitled "Save the Lives of Roving Bobbins!" revealed that the Fourth Workshop actually used hundreds of roving bobbins, each worth 8 jiao, as fuel, throwing them into the woodpile. Another big-character poster "Please Explain What This Measure Is" criticized the Second Weaving Workshop for "exiling" 400 oil shields used to prevent oil stains to the scrap pile. A big-character poster "Wasteful Rationalization Proposal" criticized the leadership for not carefully reviewing rationalization proposals. For example, 60 carding machine circular templates were made based on a rationalization proposal, 30 were installed, but they did not improve quality, resulting in waste. Many big-character posters also hung up the physical objects of waste. On a new reed clip hanging, there was a note saying "This new reed clip cannot be used when bought. 20 have been inspected. How many are there in total? Ask the purchaser." Some big-character posters criticized the waste caused by poor design, such as "Fourth Spinning Large Furnace Bottom Cut Twice" and "Why is the Second Spinning Dust Collector Placed in the Scrap Warehouse?" There were also criticisms of the "young master" style, such as the material requisition form of the Supply Section, which originally only cost 3 jiao 5 fen per book, but after "design" modification, the fourth copy used Daolin paper, costing more than 1 yuan per book, wasting 1,720 yuan. The factory's night university has just over 40 teachers, students and staff, but the budget for 1958 reached 170,000 yuan, of which 30,000 yuan was planned for repairing houses. After inspection, only 10,000 yuan was sufficient.

Now, the masses have put forward more than 1,000 opinions on this aspect. The factory's leaders are studying and solving them by category according to the spirit of "rectifying while correcting," and some have already been resolved. For example, systems such as technical measures management and drawing organization responsibilities have been established, fundamentally changing the past chaotic and wasteful phenomena. Some of the waste that has already been caused is also being salvaged, such as the parts for the 19 fine spinning machines being repaired and reused, and hundreds of roving tubes have been rescued.

    愿反浪费之火燃遍全国
    梅林罐头厂反浪费专题整改的做法值得推广
    上海国棉十七厂职工尖锐批评企业中的浪费现象
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：梅林罐头食品厂在着重整改已经取得一定成绩的基础上，领导上再次表示引火烧身的决心，动员全厂职工掀起了反浪费的专题鸣放的热潮。全厂职工仅在三、四天内就贴出了三百多张大字报，对厂内几年来的浪费现象和领导干部缺乏勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的思想，提出了尖锐的批评。据初步揭发出来的材料估计，这个厂从1954年以来，在原材料、财产、物资、质量事故和劳动力上的浪费几达四十五万元，约占全厂现有流动资金的一半。
    一张大字报揭发了厂内从1956年到1957年两年中，仅在罐头胖听（变质）方面的损失就达五万一千八百多元。生产技术科揭发：1957年1月至11月的废品损失为九千六百多元。另一个材料揭发，仅1956年发生的如罐头爆节（裂开）、漏罐等六十一件事故，按照工厂成本计算，损失达三万二千五百多元。
    原材料的浪费也是很严重的。1955年第三季度在生产菠萝罐头的时候，由于保管不善，损失十八万多斤，合计四万九千多元。1957年夏天也因为保管不善，烂了一万多公斤杏子，损失五千多元；猪脚变质损失一千一百多元。鸭子的质量检验不严格，不得不贬价卖出，仅一万二千斤鸭子的贬值，就损失了五千元左右。
    由于厂内对生产计划估计和安排不当，有时盲目招收临时工，也造成了劳动力的很大浪费。食品车间的大字报上揭发，1957年1月至11月浪费的人工达一万二千八百多个劳动日。1956年在劳动力使用上的浪费即合二万多元。
    大字报也批评了厂内在举办生活福利事业的时候，没有从六亿人口出发来考虑，而是大手大脚。厂内本来有浴室和厨房，只要稍加修理或适当扩大一下就可以了，可是又花了二万七千多元新建了浴室和厨房。工人以“基本建设浪费很大，贵族化的浴室什么时候开幕”为题，写了一首打油诗，批评了这种浪费现象。此外，厂内又和梅林牧场花了二千元合建了一个球场，虽然晚间打球的人不多，可是也装了很好的照明设备。
    职工们批评领导上对这些浪费现象漠不关心，还没有“像自己失掉一元钱的心痛态度”，而是采取睁一只眼闭一只眼的官僚主义态度。如罐头“胖听”问题，这是经常发生的，领导上却不积极组织技术人员研究改进，而认为这是常事，甚至认为“胖听”的问题其他兄弟厂也不少，因此就不重视这个问题。
    通过群众有力的批评，厂的领导干部开始深深体会到作为企业的领导人，如不树立勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的思想，不改变官僚主义主观主义的作风，会给企业和国家带来多么大的损失；因此，决心继续深入发动群众，进一步全面揭发浪费，挖根源，找办法，以便依靠群众订出切实可行的整改方案，纠正和防止浪费现象。
    本报上海7日电　上海国棉十七厂职工围绕检查勤俭办企业方针，掀起新的鸣放高潮，进一步揭发企业中严重的浪费现象。连日来群众提出揭发浪费的意见一千多条。许多大字报根据摆事实讲道理的精神，对领导上没有很好贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，提出了尖锐的批评，有的还用实物挂在大字报前面作见证。
    从座谈会和大字报揭发出来的事实看，企业中的浪费是巨大的。如供应科一个干部揭发，有十九台细纱机的车面等机件，由于保全科没有仔细审查图纸，结果机件做好后，才发觉图绘错了，使八千多元的机件不能使用。又如一张题为“救救粗纱筒管的命吧！”的大字报，揭发第四工场竟将每只价值八角的粗纱筒管几百只当作燃料，掼在木柴堆里。又如“请问这是什么措施”的大字报，批评二织布机间把四百只防止油渍用的牵手油罩“发配”到废料堆里。一张“浪费的合理化建议”大字报，批评领导上对合理化建议审查不认真。如根据合理化建议做的梳棉圆形样板，做了六十台，装了三十台，结果对提高质量不起作用，造成浪费。许多大字报还挂出浪费的实物，在一根吊着的新筘夹上，贴着一张字条“这种新筘夹买来不能用，检来二十根，究竟有多少，要问采购人”。有的大字报批评因设计不周而造成的浪费，如“四纺大炉底开刀两次”、“二纺吸尘器为啥放在废料仓库里”等。还有批评“大少爷”作风的，如供应科领料单原来只要三角五分一本，经“设计”修改后，第四联用道林纸，每本竟要一元多，浪费了一千七百二十元。这个工厂的夜大学全校师生员工不过四十多人，但1958年度预算经费竟达十七万元，其中修缮房屋计划用三万元，经过检查，只要一万元就足够了。
    现在，群众提出有关这方面的意见已经有一千多条。这个厂的领导人员正根据边整边改精神，分门别类研究解决，有的已经获得解决。如技术措施管理、绘画组织职责范围等制度已经建立，从根本上改变了过去混乱、浪费现象。有些已经造成的浪费，能挽救的也在设法挽救，如十九台细纱机的机件正在设法修配后再用，几百支粗纱管已抢救回来。
