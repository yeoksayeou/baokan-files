	Of the several types of weather – sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, and windy – the most annoying and harmful is probably the gale. When a gale arises, sand and stones fly, the sky darkens, making it impossible to open one's mouth or eyes, and inconvenient to travel. Moreover, it can bring great disasters. Strong gales can destroy crops, blow down houses, scatter herds of cattle, horses, and sheep, causing casualties among people and livestock. In desert areas, gales can even bury people and tents in the sand. Typhoons in the southeastern coastal areas often cause terrible disasters. According to records, on August 2, 1922, a typhoon landed in Shantou, Guangdong. In that one instance alone, more than 70,000 people died, and property losses amounted to about 70 million yuan. Gales pose a serious threat to people's production and life.

	Where do winds come from? They come from cold fronts, from changes in air pressure, and from thunderstorms.

	If a large-scale mass of cold air moves towards a mass of warm air, the boundary between the leading edge of the cold air and the warm air is called a cold front. The cold air behind the cold front is dense and has high air pressure; the warm air in front of the cold front is less dense and has low air pressure. Air flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, thus creating a gale. The greater the pressure difference between two adjacent areas, the greater the wind speed. This type of gale is very strong, generally reaching level six or higher, with gusts reaching level ten or higher. It usually lasts for about a day, sometimes up to two or three days; it is usually stronger during the day and weakens significantly in the evening. If the cold air behind the cold front is very strong, the gale, which has already weakened, may strengthen again the following afternoon. This type of gale is most common in winter and spring.

	Changes in the relative high and low air pressure in adjacent areas can also produce gales. A sudden surge in high pressure or a sharp drop in low pressure significantly increases the pressure difference between high and low pressures, which then produces a gale. High-pressure airflow rotates clockwise, while low-pressure (including typhoon) airflow rotates counterclockwise. If the high pressure remains stationary in the east, and the low pressure moves from west to east, with its air pressure constantly decreasing, the pressure difference between the high and low pressures becomes very large as it approaches the high pressure, resulting in a southerly gale. If the low pressure remains stationary in the east, and the high pressure moves from west to east, strengthening continuously during its eastward movement, a northerly gale is produced as it approaches the low pressure. The force of this type of wind is generally less than that of a gale caused by a strong cold front. However, it can sometimes reach level seven or higher, lasting for varying periods, generally not exceeding three days.

	Strong, localized thunderstorms in spring and summer are often accompanied by gales. This is because the raindrops in thunderstorms are very large, and the airflow cannot support them in the air, so they suddenly descend. During the descent, some raindrops evaporate due to the higher temperature below the clouds, and only the unevaporated raindrops fall to the ground. When raindrops evaporate, they inevitably absorb a large amount of heat, which lowers the temperature of the air at high altitude and increases its density. However, the air at lower levels is warm and less dense, so the cold air from high altitude violently rushes down to the lower levels, producing a gale. This type of gale lasts for a short period, about ten minutes to half an hour, and at most one or two hours.

	In the low-latitude tropical oceans, violent storms often occur, with very low air pressure at their center, but high air pressure near the center. As a result, the airflow rotates rapidly counterclockwise, producing gales of level six or higher. This is a typhoon. The closer to the typhoon center, the stronger the wind force, which can reach level ten to twelve or higher. Fortunately, after landing in China, the typhoon weakens and eventually disappears due to friction from the land and the inability to continue supplying water vapor. Therefore, the duration of the gale is not long. As for the causes of typhoon formation, there are currently various theories, which will not be listed here.

	Of these four types of gales, although the disasters caused by typhoons are serious, they are limited to the southeastern coastal areas. The most harmful and widespread is the gale generated by cold fronts.

	The strength of a gale is closely related to the geographical environment. For example, when a strong mass of cold air sweeps across China in winter, the wind force in Inner Mongolia, the Northeast Plain, the coastal areas of Shandong Peninsula, Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, and Taiwan Strait is always one or two levels higher than in other places.

	Although gales are a serious natural disaster, they can be prevented by human effort. Whenever the meteorological station issues a gale warning, the extent of the damage from the gale can be reduced or completely avoided by carrying out preventive measures.

    大风麟生
    晴、阴、雨、雪、风几种天气中，最令人讨厌和为害最大的，恐怕要算是大风。大风一起，飞沙走石，天昏地暗，不但使人口不能张、眼不能睁，不便出行，而且还会给人带来很大灾害。强烈的大风，可以吹毁庄稼，刮倒房屋，吹散牛、马、羊群，造成人畜伤亡。沙漠地带的大风，还会连人和帐篷埋在沙中。东南沿海地区的台风，就常常造成可怕的灾害。据记载，1922年8月2日台风曾在广东汕头登陆。仅那一次，就死七万余人，损失财产七千万元左右。大风，对人们生产和生活确有严重的威胁。
    风，是从哪儿来的呢？它来自冷锋，来自气压的变化，还来自雷雨。
    如果有大规模的冷空气向暖空气一方移动，冷空气前缘与暖空气的交界处，就叫冷锋。冷锋后部的冷空气，密度大，气压大；冷锋前部的暖空气，密度小，气压小。空气就从气压大的地方向气压小的地方流去，因而就产生了大风。如果相邻两地气压相差越大，风速就越大。这种大风风力很强，一般能达到六级以上，阵风可达十级以上；持续时间多在一天左右，有时能达二三日之久；通常是白天风力强，傍晚才显著减弱。如果冷锋后部的冷空气很强烈，则已减弱了的大风，次日午间还会再增强起来。冬春两季最常见的就是这种大风。
    相邻两地的高低气压相对地发生变化，也会产生大风。高气压突然猛升或低气压急剧下降，高低气压之间的气压差显著增大，就产生了大风。高气压气流是作顺时钟方向旋转，低气压（包括台风）气流作反时钟方向旋转的。如果高气压在东面不动，低气压从西面向东移动，并且气压不断下降，当它移近高气压的时候，高低气压之间的气压差就变得很大，这时就产生偏南大风。如果低气压在东面不动，高气压从西向东移动，并且在东移过程中不断加强，当其移近低气压的时候，就产生了偏北大风。这种风的风力，一般要比强冷锋所造成的大风为小。但有时也可刮七级以上的大风，持续时间有长有短，一般不会超过三天。
    春天和夏天强烈的地方性雷雨，常伴有大风发生。这是因为雷雨的水滴很大，气流不能支持它们悬浮于空中，于是突然下降。在下降途中，因云层以下的温度较高，一部分雨滴被蒸发掉，没有被蒸发的雨滴才落到地面。雨滴蒸发时，必然要吸收大量的热量，这样就使高空空气的温度降低，密度增大。但是在低层的空气是暖的，密度小，于是高空冷气流就向低层猛烈的冲击下来而产生大风。这种大风持续时间很短，约十几分钟到半小时左右，最长的也不过一、二小时。
    在低纬度热带海洋上，常产生猛烈的风暴，其中心气压非常低，但在中心附近的气压却很大，因此气流做反时钟方向急进旋转，刮六、七级以上的大风，这就是台风。靠近台风中心风力越强，可达十至十二级以上。所幸台风在我国登陆后，因受陆地摩擦和水汽不能继续供应的影响，很快就减弱以至消失。因此大风持续时间是不长的。至于台风形成的原因，目前尚有多种说法，这里不列举。
    在这四种大风中，台风所造成的灾害虽然严重，但只限于东南沿海地区。为害最大、范围最广的是冷锋产生的大风。
    大风的强弱与地理环境有密切关系。例如，当冬季强大的冷空气横扫我国时，在内蒙古、东北平原、山东半岛沿海、鄱阳湖、洞庭湖、台湾海峡等地的风力，总要比别处大一、二级。
    虽然大风是一种严重的自然灾害，但是它可以用人为的力量来预防。每当气象台发布大风警报的时候，只要做好防御工作，就可以减轻或完全避免大风的危害程度。
