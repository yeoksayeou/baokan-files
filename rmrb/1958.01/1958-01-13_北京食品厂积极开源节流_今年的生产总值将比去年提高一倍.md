Beijing Food Factory Actively Practices Increasing Income and Reducing Expenditure
This Year's Total Output Value Will Double Last Year's

(Our Dispatch) Beijing Food Factory workers are actively overcoming raw material difficulties and increasing product varieties, preparing to increase this year's total output value by double that of last year.

The Beijing Food Factory specializes in the production of cold foods such as popsicles, soda water, fruit juice, jam, and artificial ice. Last year, almost every major raw material needed for production was felt to be lacking. However, they were not intimidated by the difficulties, and promptly sent people to various places to find sources of supply, which not only ensured production, but also increased the production of popsicles by more than double that of 1956, and fruit juice increased by two times.

They began preparing the raw materials for this year as early as three months ago. More than 1,000 tons of oranges used for producing orange juice have already been purchased in Shantou and Changsha, and sugar is also being negotiated for purchase with relevant departments. The laboratory is currently researching the production of "invert sugar" (this sugar is sweeter than granulated sugar), and it is expected that a trial production can be successfully completed in the first quarter. At that time, the same amount of granulated sugar can be used to produce 20% more products.

The Beijing Food Factory not only adopted a positive attitude in finding raw material sources, but also made full use of raw materials. For example, they use oranges to make orange juice, and orange peel to make orange oil to replace flavorings. Last year, they extracted more than 520 kilograms of orange oil from orange peels, which solved the problem of the flavoring needed for making orange juice. They sold orange fibers and orange seeds to medicinal material companies, increasing income by more than 2,000 yuan. In the past, after they soaked hawthorns to extract the juice, all the pulp was thrown away. After research, they decided to mash it into a paste to make popsicles.

Due to different seasonal needs, this factory originally had nothing to do every winter, and production was difficult to arrange. Before the New Year, according to the slogan of changing the off-season to the peak season put forward by the higher authorities, they increased the production of fruit juice and hawthorn cake in winter. In summer, the second and fourth workshops produce cold foods such as popsicles and ice bricks, and in winter they make hawthorn cake, preserved plum cake, candied fruit, and small pastries; the third workshop makes soda water, various fruit juices, and fruit juice in summer, and makes more fruit juice in winter. Now they no longer feel the difference between the off-season and the peak season.

### 北京食品厂积极开源节流  今年的生产总值将比去年提高一倍

    北京食品厂积极开源节流
    今年的生产总值将比去年提高一倍
    本报讯　北京食品厂职工积极克服原料困难，增加产品品种，准备把今年的生产总值比去年提高一倍。
    北京食品厂是专门生产冰棍、汽水、果子露、果酱、人造冰等冷食的工厂。去年生产上需要的主要原料几乎样样都感到缺乏。但是他们没有被困难吓倒，及时派人到各地去寻找货源，不仅保证了生产，而且使冰棍的生产比1956年增加一倍多，果子露增加两倍。
    今年用的原料，他们早在三个月以前就开始准备了。生产桔汁用的一千多吨桔子，已经在汕头、长沙买妥，砂糖也正在和有关部门接洽采购中。现在试验室正在研究制“转化糖”（这种糖比砂糖还甜），预计在第一季度内就可以试制成功，那时候，用同样数量的砂糖，就可以多生产20％的产品。
    北京食品厂不仅在寻找原料货源上采取了积极态度，在原料的使用上也做到充分利用。例如他们用桔子做成桔汁，用桔皮做桔油代替香精。去年，他们从桔皮中提取桔油五百二十多公斤，解决了做桔汁所需香精的问题。他们把桔络、桔籽卖给药材公司，增加收入二千多元。过去他们把红果泡制取出汁以后，果肉全部扔掉，经过研究，决定打成酱做冰棍。
    因为季节需要的不同，这个厂原来每到冬天就没有活干，生产很难安排。年前，他们根据上级提出来的变淡季为旺季的口号，在冬季增加了果汁、金糕（山渣糕）的生产。夏季，第二和第四车间生产冰棍、冰砖等冷食，冬天做金糕、酸梅糕、密饯和小点心；第三车间夏季做汽水、各种果子汁，果子露，冬季就多做些果子汁。现在他们已经感觉不到有淡季和旺季的区别了。
