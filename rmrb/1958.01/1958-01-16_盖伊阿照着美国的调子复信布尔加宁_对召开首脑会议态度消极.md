Xinhua News Agency, January 15th, Paris Dispatch: The reply of French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard to the letter of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nikolai Bulganin dated December 10th of last year was released on the 14th.

In the letter, Gaillard stated that “a meeting at the level of heads of government can be resumed at an appropriate time,” but he also expressed his unwillingness to hold such a meeting promptly. He insisted that a meeting of foreign ministers must be held first before any meeting of heads of government. He advocated that this “preparatory” meeting of foreign ministers should “not study the substance of the issues,” but rather discuss “the agenda of the final high-level meeting.”

He said in the letter that he was willing to explore with Bulganin "ways to resume discussion of the issues that divide us" on the issue of disarmament and was willing to "re-discuss the specific problems of Europe, including the proposals you (Bulganin) have put forward." However, he said that heads of government could only meet to discuss these issues after “thorough preparations” had been made.

Gaillard's letter was drafted in close consultation with the allied countries of the North Atlantic bloc. The strong desire of the French and Western European public for a summit meeting prompted Gaillard to mention the necessity of holding a summit meeting in his letter. However, the influence from the U.S. side can also be seen in this letter. U.S. authorities are currently repeating the argument that a summit meeting must have such and such "thorough preparations" beforehand, attempting to achieve their goal of actually delaying and obstructing the convening of such a meeting by using various "preparations."

Apart from the issue of a summit meeting, Gaillard held a negative attitude towards almost all of the Soviet Union's other major peace initiatives in the letter.

Although Gaillard said in the letter that he hoped to reach an agreement on "specific issues that would partially help solve those that divide the world today," he did not put forward any new proposals in this regard.

    盖伊阿照着美国的调子复信布尔加宁
    对召开首脑会议态度消极
    据新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理盖伊阿对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁去年12月10日的信件的答复，在14日公布。
    盖伊阿在信中表示“在适当的时候可以重新举行政府首脑级会议”，但是，他又表示不准备及早来举行这样的会议，他坚持必须先召开外长会议，才能举行政府首脑的任何会议。他主张，这种进行“准备”的外长会议“不是研究问题的实质”，而是来讨论“最后举行的高级会议的议程”。
    他在信中说，准备同布尔加宁一道来研究在裁军问题上“恢复讨论使我们分裂的问题的办法”，准备“重新讨论欧洲的具体问题，包括你（布尔加宁）所提出的建议在内”。但是，他说，必须先进行“缜密的准备”后，政府首脑才能集会来讨论这些问题。
    盖伊阿这封信是在同北大西洋集团盟国密切磋商中草拟出来的。法国及西欧各国公众要求举行最高级会议的强烈愿望，促使盖伊阿在信中谈到举行政府首脑会议的必要性。但是，从这封信中也可以看到来自美国方面的影响。美国当权人士目前正在重复着最高级会议事先必须这样那样的“缜密准备”的论调，企图达到他们实际上要用种种“准备”来竭力拖延和阻挠这种会议的召开的目的。
    在政府首脑会议问题以外，盖伊阿在信中几乎对苏联其他许多重大和平倡议都抱否定态度。
    盖伊阿虽然在信中说，他希望就“部分地有助于解决今天使世界陷于分裂的那些具体问题”达成协议。但是，在这方面，他没有提出什么新的建议。
