Xinhua News Agency report: Western European political and social figures are increasingly demanding high-level talks to resolve international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Even some who have consistently supported the aggressive policies of the United States are expressing support for talks with the Soviet Union.

French Socialist leader and former Prime Minister Mollet said on the 5th at the Socialist Party Congress that he believes a "peace of collective security, including arbitration and disarmament" can be achieved through discussions and coordination between countries. He also believes that Europe can become a bridge for the peaceful coexistence of different systems.

Mollet acknowledged that the Soviet Union does not want war. As for the United States, he said there are various opinions in the United States, some of which are "very dangerous," such as the war policy.

Rome's "Giustizia" published an article by Italian Social Democratic leader Saragat on the 5th. Although he supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he also said that Bulganin's proposals are "worthy of careful study." Saragat believes that the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is the most important. Saragat also wrote that the proposal for the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to destroy their stockpiled atomic and hydrogen bombs should also be given attention. Regarding the issue of holding East-West summit talks, Saragat believes that these negotiations should address specific issues such as disarmament, German reunification, and the establishment of neutral zones in Europe.

Austrian Chancellor Raab, in a radio address on the 5th, advocated holding high-level East-West talks in order to reach a "just compromise agreement." He said that a "just compromise agreement" means "an agreement that is not detrimental to either side," which would calm the regions where tensions currently exist.

The British Peace Committee has called for a large-scale peace march on January 23, demanding East-West summit talks. Committee Chairman Canon Collins said that demands for negotiations and the rejection of missile bases are emerging all over Britain. He said: "Opposition to American bombers carrying hydrogen bombs, refusal to accept missile bases, and rejection of American domination are all signs that the attitude of the masses is rapidly changing, and this is a shift that no political leader can ignore."

Robert Willis, Secretary-General of the London Typographical Society, advocated in his New Year's message for a halt to hydrogen weapons testing and that the government seek peaceful solutions to outstanding international issues. The Yorkshire Association of Trades Councils, representing 250,000 trade union members, urged the Trades Union Congress to make Macmillan aware of the strong desire of the British people for peace.

Many prominent figures in British cultural circles have also advocated resolving disputes between East and West through negotiations. The renowned philosopher Bertrand Russell, in an article published in "The Observer," sharply criticized the Western countries' policy based on the principle of "deterrence." He said, "The idea that making hydrogen bombs will enhance the security of our country is simply too stupid to imagine." Russell believes that talks are the best way to eliminate the threat of nuclear war. Russell hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union will hold frank discussions as a first step in exploring the possibility of a compromise policy that does not only benefit one side. Russell also expressed support for the establishment of a neutral zone in Central Europe.

Richard Goold-Adams, Far East commentator for "The Economist" magazine, wrote in an article in "The Sunday Times" on the 5th that the proposal to withdraw foreign troops from the territories of members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact has "appeared with a new face and has a new appeal." He went on to say that "a careful study should not be refused" of the Soviet proposals.

    西欧人士普遍要求同苏联谈判
    摩勒、萨拉盖特和奥总理也表示赞成
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：西欧政界和社会人士越来越多地要求举行最高级会谈，通过和平谈判来解决国际争端，甚至一些向来替美国侵略政策帮腔的人，也表示赞成同苏联会谈。
    法国社会党领袖、前总理摩勒5日在社会党代表大会上说，他认为，可以通过各国之间的讨论和协调来取得“集体安全的和平，包括仲裁和裁军在内的和平”。他还认为，欧洲可以成为让不同制度和平共处的桥梁。
    摩勒承认，苏联是不希望战争的。至于美国，他说，在美国有各种不同的意见，其中有些是“很危险的”，例如战争政策就是这些危险的意见之一。
    罗马“正义报”5日登载了意大利社会民主党领袖萨拉盖特的一篇文章。他虽然替北大西洋集团捧场，但是同时也说，布尔加宁的建议“值得仔细地研究”。萨拉盖特认为关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议是最重要的。萨拉盖特还写道，关于苏联、美国和英国销毁它们所储存的原子弹和氢弹的建议也应当予以重视。关于举行东西方最高级会谈问题，萨拉盖特认为，这次谈判应当解决像裁军、德国统一和在欧洲建立中立区等具体问题。
    奥地利总理拉布5日在广播演说中主张举行东西方高级会谈，以便达成“公正的折衷协议”。他说，所谓“公正的折衷协议”是指“对双方都没有损害的协议”，这样的协议将使目前存在着紧张局势的地区平静下来。
    英国和平委员会号召在1月23日举行要求举行东西方最高级会谈的大规模和平游行。委员会主席戈旦·谢菲尔说，英国各地纷纷提出要谈判不要导弹基地的要求。他说：“反对载有氢弹的美国轰炸机、拒绝接受导弹基地、拒绝美国的统治这些都是表明人民群众的态度正在迅速转变的迹象，而这种态度的转变是没有一个政界领袖能够忽视的。”
    伦敦印刷业协会秘书长罗伯特·韦利斯在新年文告中主张停止氢武器试验，主张政府设法和平解决悬而未决的国际问题。代表二十五万工会会员的约克郡工会联合会敦促职工大会要麦克米伦重视英国人民要求和平的强烈愿望。
    英国文化界许多著名人士也纷纷主张通过谈判来解决东西方之间的争端。著名哲学家伯特朗德·罗素在一篇刊登在“观察家报”的文章中尖锐地斥责西方国家建筑在“威慑因素”原则上的政策。他说，“认为制造氢弹就能加强我们国家的安全的想法简直愚蠢得使人不能想像。”罗素认为会谈是消除核战争威胁的最好方法。罗素希望美国和苏联举行坦率的讨论，作为探讨不只让一方占便宜的折衷政策的可能性的第一步。罗素并且表示赞成在中欧建立中立区。
    英国“经济学家”杂志远东问题评论员理查德·固尔德·亚当斯5日在“星期日泰晤士报”上发表一篇文章说，关于从北大西洋集团和华沙条约各成员国的领土上撤退外国军队的建议已“出现了新的面貌，并且具有新的吸引力”。他接着说，“不应该拒绝仔细研究”苏联的建议。
