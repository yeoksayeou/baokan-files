    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on December 31st, the first artificial satellite had orbited the Earth 1,336 times, and the second artificial satellite had orbited 815 times.
    According to recent observations, the orbit of the first satellite has greatly shrunk and approached the Earth. The maximum distance of the satellite from the Earth is now no longer the 950 kilometers at the time of launch, but about 320 kilometers.
    Its orbital period is already slightly less than 90 minutes and is continuing to shorten rapidly. It is expected that the first satellite will enter the dense atmosphere and perish in early January.
    By Moscow New Year's time, that is, at midnight Moscow time on December 31, 1957, the first artificial satellite will have completed 1,348 orbits around the Earth, covering a distance of approximately 57.6 million kilometers; the second artificial satellite will have completed 826 orbits, covering a distance of approximately 37.6 million kilometers.

    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到12月31日莫斯科时间早晨六点钟为止，第一个人造卫星围绕地球转了一千三百三十六圈，第二个人造卫星转了八百一十五圈。
    根据最近观测结果看来，第一个卫星的轨道已经大大缩小和接近地球。卫星距地面的最大高度现在已经不是在发射时的九百五十公里，而是三百二十公里左右。
    它的运行周期已经稍小于九十分钟，并且正在继续迅速缩短。预计第一个卫星在1月初即将进入稠密大气层而陨灭。
    到莫斯科新年的时候，即到莫斯科时间1957年12月31日午夜十二点的时候，第一个人造卫星将围绕地球转完一千三百四十八圈，走完约五千七百六十万公里的路程；第二个人造卫星将转完八百二十六圈，走完约三千七百六十万公里的路程。
