    Agricultural Cooperatives Should Stop Members from Gambling
    In Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, many agricultural cooperative members are unwilling to participate in labor production after the income distribution. They gamble in groups of three or four day and night. For example, Sun Buchang and Wang Hongshun, members of the Zhu Lian Cooperative in Luduo Township, gambled for a whole day and night on December 18th. Sun Buchang lost more than 20 yuan in one night, even losing the money for buying a quilt. Wang Hongshun stole wood from the supply and marketing cooperative for gambling and even sold a boat belonging to the agricultural cooperative. Another example is Liang Guangfa and Zhou Wenbin, cadres of the Daxin Cooperative in Renli Township, who lost more than 70 yuan in two days and two nights on the 18th and 19th. Because they lost all their money, they almost caused a murder case. This bad trend not only affects agricultural production but also seriously damages local public security. Therefore, I suggest that all agricultural cooperatives should educate and stop members from gambling.

    农业社要制止社员赌博
    江苏省宝应县有不少农业社社员在收益分配以后，不愿参加劳动生产，日夜三、四个一伙进行赌博。例如鲁垛乡朱连社社员孙步昌、王洪顺等人在12月18日赌了一天一夜。孙步昌在一夜中就输了二十多元，连买被子的钱也输光了。王洪顺为了赌博偷了供销社的木头，把农业社的一条船也卖掉了。又如仁里乡大新社社干部梁光发、周文斌等人在18、19日两天两夜中输了七十多元，因为输光了钱，险些还逼出人命案。这种坏风气不但影响了农业生产，同时严重地破坏了地方治安。因此我建议各农业社应当教育和制止社员赌博。
