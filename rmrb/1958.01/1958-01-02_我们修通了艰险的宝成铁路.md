We Built the Treacherous Baoji-Chengdu Railway
Xiong Yuzhong, former Director of the Baoji Unified Command Post of the Ministry of Railways, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways

Building a railway transportation artery connecting Northwest and Southwest China on the "more difficult than ascending to heaven" Shu Road is indeed an extraordinary feat. Only the liberated, heroic, and hardworking Chinese working class and its intellectuals, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, could accomplish such a heroic undertaking that no predecessors had ever done with their own hands and minds.

This railway artery, with a total length of 668.2 kilometers, passes through 19 cities and counties in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. Except for 20% of the line passing through hills and plains, the rest of the line runs along towering mountains, steep cliffs, winding canyons, and turbulent rivers. It is indeed a place where "mountains and rivers reach their end, and one suspects there is no road" and "apes and monkeys try to cross but worry about climbing." These sections are also mostly in grade six and seven earthquake zones, with extremely complex geological and hydrological conditions, including ancient glacial relics, large and small transverse faults, and ancient landslides. The rock strata are highly jointed and severely weathered, with heavy rainfall and loose soil along the line, and abundant groundwater. Such complex terrain and geological conditions brought a series of difficulties to design and construction.

After leaving Baoji Station and crossing the Wei River, within an aerial distance of 23 kilometers, the line uses a 30‰ electric double-engine traction slope, adopting three horseshoe-shaped and one "8"-shaped line, winding 40 kilometers to ascend 817 meters, and passing through the Qinling Mountains' pass with the 2,364-meter Qinling Long Tunnel. From the south of the Qinling Mountains, the line relies on the mountains and water, following the Jialing River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River, for 310 kilometers, crossing the Jialing River 16 times, meandering in the Qinling and Daba Mountains, and then reaching Guangyuan. From Guangyuan, it leaves the Jialing River and enters the Jianmen Mountain area, known as "one man guarding the pass, a million cannot approach," going up along the Jing River, crossing the Jianmen Mountain watershed with a 20‰ steam double-engine traction slope, and reaching Mianyang along the Fu River and its tributaries. Leaving Mianyang, the terrain undulates, and the terrain opens up, entering the West Sichuan Plain crisscrossed by rivers and canals, and then reaching Chengdu.

The construction workload of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is extremely large: the earthwork and stonework for the roadbed alone amount to 68.77 million cubic meters. If it were built into an earth and stone wall one meter high and one meter wide, it could reach Beijing from Chengdu 34 times. The average earthwork and stonework volume per kilometer is 100,300 cubic meters; in sections with more earthwork and stonework, the average is 164,000 cubic meters per kilometer. There are 623 retaining walls between Baoji and Shangxiba alone, and the volume of masonry and concrete work is 405,607 cubic meters. There are 304 tunnels along the line, with a total length of 84,428 meters, accounting for 12.6% of the total length of the line; among them, the total length of tunnels in the three sections from Yangjiawan to Qinling accounts for 56.7% of the length of this section, and some people call this section an "underground railway." There are 981 large, medium, and small bridges, with a total length of 26,708 meters, accounting for 4% of the total length of the line. In the process of road construction, China's traditional construction technology was also developed, combined with "local materials," and more than a hundred stone arch bridges were built. Among them, there is the Shensha River stone arch bridge with six spans and a length of 176.5 meters; and the Songshupo Bridge, a stone-arched bridge with a span of 38 meters and a height of 50 meters, hangs high on the mountainside, like a rainbow, which is extremely spectacular. There are 989 culverts, with a total length of 15,422 meters.

The amount of engineering is large, and the materials used are also large, and the amount of material transportation is also large. The main materials used in the Baoji to Shangxiba section alone include 370,000 tons of cement, 300,000 cubic meters of wood, and 55,000 tons of steel (including steel rails and steel beams). 1,700 trucks, more than 1,000 wooden boats and other transportation tools were used to transport these materials, with a total transportation volume of 120 million ton-kilometers; after the track was laid, a large number of materials were also transported by train.

In order to build this railway, the Ministry of Railways concentrated a large number of forces to engage in battle. For example, the Second Engineering Bureau started construction northward from Chengdu on July 1, 1952. The Sixth Engineering Bureau and the comrades who returned from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea attacked the stubborn "enemy" of the Qinling Mountains together. Most of the strength of the Fourth Engineering Bureau was concentrated in the middle and southern sections of Baoji-Chengdu, and the tasks undertaken by its Second Engineering Division were almost equivalent to the tasks of an engineering bureau. The Tunnel Engineering Company was organized on the basis of the strength of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway between Mianyang and Guangyuan. This professional team built 25% of the tunnels on the entire line. In terms of design, there are the First and Second Design Institutes, and the Second and Sixth Basic Construction Bureaus are responsible for contracting, inspection, and acceptance. There are also several units that have undertaken some local or individual construction tasks. All these units worked intensively on this line for three to five years. When construction was in full swing, there were hundreds of thousands of employees working hard, some forgetting to eat and sleep, suffering from illnesses due to overwork, and even sacrificing their lives. This powerful railway construction army, on the entire construction site, was like entering an extremely complex railway "university," enriching the ability to build the motherland and strengthening the team. In the past few years, 1,404 engineering and technical personnel, 6,458 management personnel, and 11,864 workers who did not understand technology originally have understood technology, and those with lower technical levels have also improved to varying degrees. Recalling that originally they were having a headache when they encountered tunnels, and timid when they encountered tunnels of thousands of meters long, after the training of the Baoji-Chengdu Road, even the 4,000-meter-long tunnels on the Sichuan-Guizhou Line, the employees are also very confident to complete it, which precisely shows the rapid growth of our construction strength.

The broad masses of workers fully demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, widely promoted advanced experiences, put forward rationalization proposals, and improved labor productivity and reduced costs. After several years of exploration and experimentation, by the first quarter of last year, the Second Bureau had summarized 206 effective advanced experiences and produced 133 advanced production units and 9,765 advanced producers. According to incomplete statistics over the years, the employees of the entire line put forward 8,114 rationalization proposals, adopted 3,611 of them, and saved a total of more than 27 million yuan. The labor productivity of the entire line is constantly improving. Taking the Second Bureau as an example, with the labor productivity of 1953 as 100, it was 107 in 1954, 153 in 1955, and 190 in 1956. While labor productivity increased, advanced experiences and rationalization proposals were widely promoted, so that the number of workdays used for engineering worth 10,000 yuan was gradually reduced from 1,954 in 1953 to only 1,004 in 1956; the number of workdays used per cubic meter of earthwork and stonework (including stonework) was 0.68 in 1953, and 0.47 in 1956; the number of workdays used per meter of tunnel was 500 in 1953, and only 125 in 1956. The use of advanced methods has greatly saved raw materials. For example, in 1956, the promotion of grouting and masonry of rubble and concrete plus rubble saved 15,500 tons of cement throughout the year, and the continued use of the above methods and concrete plasticizers in the first half of last year also saved 5,695 tons of cement, with a value of 426,840 yuan.

In order to complete the construction of this railway, mechanized, industrialized, and small-scale mechanized construction were gradually developed and improved. The main construction machinery used on the entire line gradually increased to more than 1,200 units. Due to the high engineering density, electric machinery was mostly used for construction. The mechanization of tunnel excavation on the entire line reached more than 80%. Reinforced concrete T-beams of 16 meters and below were all centrally manufactured in the finished product factory and transported to the site for erection. Self-created simple track laying machines were also used for track laying, which once reached a record of 4.26 kilometers per day. Small-scale mechanized construction is a good method that is enthusiastically liked by employees and has become the development direction of future construction.

After the serious collapses were discovered during the rainy season of 1955, the Party and the higher authorities made timely and correct decisions to rectify the diseases. Leaders at higher levels and Soviet experts have repeatedly gone deep into the scene for inspection, specific guidance and help. Responsible comrades of relevant bureaus and institutes also took this as the central task and actively deployed. The number of surveying and designing personnel reached more than 1,300 at most, and the number of construction teams reached more than 50,000 at most. The diseases that have occurred have been basically cured except for a few construction points that are continuing to be rectified (which do not affect traffic), so that traffic safety has been guaranteed.

In the process of building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the 321-kilometer line from Chengdu to Mianyang and Mianyang to Shangxiba was officially handed over to the state for operation in 1954 and 1955 respectively. After the entire line was connected at Huangsha River thirteen months ahead of schedule in July the year before last, in addition to transporting more than 2 million tons of construction materials, it also transported more than 2 million tons of materials and more than 3 million passengers to the local area.

The successful completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is another proof of the superiority of my country's socialist system and the necessity of the Party's leadership, and that the Party can lead technology. It is the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, and a heroic and glorious page in the history of railway construction.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been completed, and from now on, "the Shu Road is no longer difficult, and natural barriers have become a smooth road." This is a heroic cause, and this is the result of the hard work of heroic people. We must have a more high-spirited will to overcome difficulties, and we must have a vigorous, indomitable, and persistent spirit to do heroic undertakings and be heroic people without arrogance or impetuosity, to welcome the second five-year plan and a new upsurge in production.

    我们修通了艰险的宝成铁路
    铁道部原宝鸡统一指挥所所长  铁道部第二工程局党委书记  熊宇忠
    在“难于上青天”的蜀道上，修起一条贯串我国西北同西南的铁路运输干线，的确是一件不平常的事情。只有解放了的英勇、勤劳的中国工人阶级及其知识分子，在中国共产党的领导下，才能够用自己的双手和头脑干出这样前人所没有做过的英雄事业来。
    这条全长六百六十八点二公里的铁路干线，经过陕西、甘肃、四川三省的十九个市、县，全线除20％的线路经过丘陵和平原地区外，其余线路沿途都是丛山峻岭，悬崖绝壁，峡谷曲折，河流湍急，确是“山穷水尽疑无路”和“猿猱欲度愁攀缘”的地方。这些地段又多是六、七级地震区，地质水文情况极为复杂，有古代冰川遗址、大小横断和古老滑坡，岩层节理发达，风化严重，沿线雨量大，土质松散，地下水旺盛。这样复杂的地形地质情况，就给设计和施工带来了一系列的困难。
    线路出宝鸡站跨过渭河后，在航空距离二十三公里内，以千分之三十电气双机牵引坡度，采用三个马蹄形、一个“8”字形线路，迂回四十公里上升八百一十七公尺，以二千三百六十四公尺的秦岭长隧道过秦岭垭口。从秦岭以南，线路依山靠水，沿长江的主要支流嘉陵江而下三百一十公里，跨过嘉陵江十六次，蜿蜒于秦岭和大巴山山脉中，然后到达广元。由广元离开嘉陵江进入“一夫怒临关，百万未可傍”的剑门山区，沿靖江而上，以千分之二十蒸气双机牵引坡度越过剑门山分水岭，沿涪江及其支流直达绵阳。离开绵阳，丘陵起伏，地势开阔，进入河渠交织的川西平原，然后到达成都。
    宝成铁路的建筑工程量是极其庞大的：路基土石方工程就有六千八百七十七万立方公尺，如果垒成高宽一公尺的土石墙，可从成都通到北京三十四次。平均每公里土石方工程量有十万零三千立方公尺；在土石方较多的区段，平均每公里有十六万四千立方公尺。御土墙仅宝鸡到上西坝间就有六百二十三座，砌石和混凝土工程量有四十万五千六百零七立方公尺。全线有隧道三百零四座，总长八万四千四百二十八公尺，占全线总长度的12.6％；其中杨家湾到秦岭三个区间，隧道总长度占这段线路长度的56.7％，有人把这一段称为“地下铁路”。大、中、小桥共九百八十一座，总长二万六千七百零八公尺，占全线总长度的4％。筑路过程中还发展了中国传统的建筑技术，结合“就地取材”，修建了百多座石拱桥。其中有六孔长达一百七十六点五公尺的深沙河石拱桥；有跨度三十八公尺、高五十公尺的石砌连拱的松树坡桥，高悬山腰，宛如长虹，极为壮观。涵管有九百八十九座，总长度为一万五千四百二十二公尺。
    工程量大，使用的材料也多，材料运输量也大。宝鸡到上西坝段使用的主要材料，就有水泥三十七万吨，木材三十万立方公尺，钢材五万五千吨（包括钢轨、钢梁）。运送这些材料使用了一千七百辆汽车，一千多条木船和其他各种运输工具，共计运量一亿二千万吨公里；铺轨以后还用火车运了大批材料。
    为修建这条铁路，铁道部集中了大批力量投入战斗。如第二工程局在1952年7月1日从成都向北修筑。第六工程局和抗美援朝回来的同志一起攻打秦岭这个顽强的“敌人”。第四工程局大半力量集中到宝成中段和南段，他们所属第二工程处担负的任务几乎等于一个工程局的任务。隧道工程公司是以修建成渝铁路和宝成铁路绵阳广元之间隧道的力量为基础组织起来的。这支专业队伍，修建了全线隧道的25％。在设计上有第一、第二设计院，执行发包、检查、验收工作的有第二、第六基本建设分局。还有几个单位分别担任了一些局部的、或是个别工程项目的建设任务。所有这些单位，在这条线上紧张地工作了三、五年，全面施工时有十几万职工在辛勤的劳动，有的废寝忘餐，因劳成疾，奋不顾身，甚至有的付出了生命。这支强大的铁路建设大军，在整个施工现场，像进了一个极其复杂的铁路“大学”，丰富了建设祖国的本领，壮大了队伍。几年来，培养和提拔了一千四百零四名工程技术人员，六千四百五十八名管理人员，有一万一千八百六十四名工人原是不懂技术的懂得了技术，原来技术水平较低的也有了不同程度的提高。回想原来碰到隧道就头疼，遇到千把公尺长的就胆怯，经过宝成路的锻炼，现在就是川黔线上四千多公尺长的隧道，职工们也很有信心的完成它，这正说明我们的建设力量的迅速成长。
    广大职工在宝成铁路的建设中充分发挥了积极性和创造性，广泛推行先进经验、提合理化建议、提高了劳动生产率降低了成本。经过几年来的摸索试验，到去年一季度止，二局已总结出行之有效的先进经验二百零六种，涌现了先进生产单位一百三十三个，先进生产者九千七百六十五人。据几年不完全统计，全线职工提出合理化建议八千一百一十四件，采用了三千六百一十一件，共节约二千七百多万元。全线劳动生产率不断地提高，就二局来说，以1953年劳动生产率为一百，1954年为一百零七，1955年为一百五十三，1956年为一百九十。在劳动生产率增长的同时，广泛推行了先进经验和合理化建议，使价值每一万元的工程所用的工数由1953年的一千九百五十四个，逐渐降到1956年只要一千零四个工；土石方（包括石方）每立方公尺在1953年用零点六八个工，到1956年为零点四七个；隧道每公尺在1953年为五百个工，到1956年只要一百二十五个。使用了先进方法，更大大节约了原材料，如1956年推行挤浆安砌片石及混凝土加片石等方法，全年节约水泥一万五千五百吨，去年上半年继续采用上述方法及混凝土塑化剂等也节约水泥五千六百九十五吨，其价值为四十二万六千八百四十元。
    为完成这条铁路的修筑，逐步发展提高了机械化工厂化和小型机械化施工。全线使用的主要建筑机械逐渐增加到一千二百多台，由于工程密度大，大部采用电动机械施工。全线隧道开挖的机械化程度达到80％以上。十六公尺及以下的钢筋混凝土丁字梁都是集中在成品厂制好，运往现场架设的。还采用了自创的简易铺轨机关来进行铺轨，曾达到每日四点二六公里的纪录。小型机械施工是受到职工热烈喜欢的好方法，并成为今后施工的发展方向。
    1955年雨季发现坍方情况严重后，党和上级及时正确地做出整治病害的决定，上级领导和苏联专家，曾先后多次深入现场检查，具体指导与帮助。有关局、院负责同志，也以此为中心任务，积极部署。勘测设计人员最多时达一千三百余人，施工队伍最多时达五万余人。现在已发生的病害，除少数工点正在继续整治（已不影响行车）外，基本上得到根治，使行车安全得到了保证。
    在宝成铁路的修建过程中，成都至绵阳、绵阳至上西坝三百二十一公里的线路，已于1954年、1955年分别交付国家正式营业了。前年7月份全线在黄沙河提前十三个月接轨后，除运送筑路材料二百多万吨外，还给地方运送了物资二百多万吨，运送了旅客三百多万。
    宝成铁路的胜利建成，是我国社会主义制度优越和必须有共产党领导，而党能领导技术的又一证明，是中苏友好合作的结晶，是铁路建筑史上英雄光辉的一页。
    宝成铁路修通了，从此“蜀道不再难，天险变坦途”，这是一种英雄的事业，这是英雄的人辛劳的成果。我们要有更昂扬的战胜困难的意志，要有朝气蓬勃、百折不挠、再接再厉的精神，不骄不躁地做英雄的事业、做英雄的人，来迎接第二个五年计划和新的生产高潮。
