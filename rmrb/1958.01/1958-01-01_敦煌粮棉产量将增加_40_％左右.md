　　Dunhuang Grain and Cotton Production Will Increase by About 40%

　　(Our dispatch) In 1957, the per-unit yield of grain and cotton in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, had already reached the targets set by the National Program for Agricultural Development: 401 jin for grain and 105.5 jin for cotton. Now, the county has formulated a production plan for the next ten years. In 1958, the grain planting area will increase by 45,000 mu (wasteland) compared to 1957, with an average yield of 402 jin per mu for the entire county. The total output will increase by about 40%.

　　In order to realize this plan and strive for a bumper harvest in the first year of the plan – 1958, the county's farmers are braving the severe cold to carry out a winter production campaign. The plan for 1958 is to apply ten cartloads of fertilizer per mu, requiring a total of more than 2 million cartloads of fertilizer. More than 1.6 million cartloads have already been accumulated, which is more than 400,000 cartloads more than the total amount of fertilizer applied in 1957. In addition, considerable progress has been made in dam construction, canal repair, and land improvement.

    敦煌粮棉产量将增加40％左右
    本报讯　甘肃省敦煌县1957年的粮棉单位产量已达到农业纲要所规定的指标：粮食四百零一斤，棉花一百零五点五斤。现在这个县又订出了今后十年的生产规划，1958年的粮食播种面积要比1957年增加四万五千亩（荒地），全县平均亩产四百零二斤。总产量将增加40％左右。
    为了实现这个规划，并争取实现规划第一年——1958年的大丰收，全县农民正在冒着严寒天气开展冬季生产运动。1958年计划每亩施肥十车，共需肥料二百多万车，现在已经积了一百六十多万车，比1957年全年施肥量还多四十多万车，此外，打坝、修渠、整理土地等方面也都做出不少成绩。
