Are there enough seeds for the spring sowing? What about the quality? These are the keys to determining whether this year's spring sowing plan can be completed. At present, various places are actively engaged in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, but some places have neglected the inspection of spring sowing seeds as a result. This will cause adverse consequences. While carrying out the above tasks, all localities need to seize the opportunity to take stock of the preparation of this year's spring sowing seeds, so as to avoid the passive phenomenon of being caught off guard by a shortage of seeds and having to look for them everywhere.

Some cadres simply rely on the transfer of seeds from other places and do not prepare themselves. However, the seeds transferred from commercial grain from other places are generally of poor quality. For example, when Heilongjiang Province lacked rice seeds during the spring sowing last year, the rice seeds transferred from other provinces were not only of many varieties but also of poor quality, which greatly affected rice production.

Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), all localities have been actively organizing a great leap forward in agricultural production. The original agricultural production plans have been appropriately revised and improved after extensive debates; increasing the planting of high-yield crops and expanding the area of land reform, and overfulfilling the production increase targets have also become the common goals of struggle on the agricultural production front. As a result, many places do not have enough seeds in terms of quantity and variety, or they are not suitable for the requirements of land reform. For example, Hubei Province plans to expand double-cropping rice by more than 4 million mu this year, and the seeds originally reserved in the province are in short supply, and the amount relying on transfers from other provinces is nearly 100 million jin. Hunan Province is organizing a great leap forward in production, and this year it is also short of more than 50 million jin of early and late rice seeds. It can be seen that under the new production conditions this year, it is extremely important for agricultural cooperatives in various places to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the spring sowing seeds reserved by themselves and the state, and to realistically calculate the amount of seeds used based on the planting plan of various spring sowing crops as preparation.

Areas where the quantity of seeds is insufficient should be resolved by means of transfer under the unified leadership of the local party and government organs and the close cooperation of agricultural, grain, supply and marketing and other relevant departments. In solving the problem of seed shortage, it is necessary to implement the principle of "mass mutual exchange as the main method and national transfer and supply as the auxiliary method", and vigorously organize the masses to tap the potential of seeds to reduce the burden on the country. Last year, in many areas of Hebei Province, seed exchange meetings were held at the township level to mobilize the exchange of surpluses and deficiencies and mutual exchange between cooperatives. In terms of transfer methods, mutually beneficial methods such as pricing according to quality, exchanging grain for seeds, exchanging seeds for seeds, and making up the difference are generally adopted, which has a good effect. For example, Ping'an County planned to plant more than 120,000 mu of spring sowing crops last year, requiring 430,000 jin of seeds. Because of the severe disaster, there was a shortage of seeds. Through the above methods, 200,000 jin of seeds were exchanged, which basically solved the difficulty of seed shortage. Last year, Lu Liang County in Yunnan Province held a transfer meeting for spring sowing and broad bean seeds three months before the harvest of broad beans, and carried out the transfer of small spring seeds and the reservation and breeding of large spring seeds. The townships and cooperatives that needed seeds signed seed purchase contracts with the seed stations, thus ensuring the immediate sowing of small spring seeds. The methods of these provinces and counties to solve the shortage of seeds are worth referring to. At present, some rural cadres in some areas are still somewhat paralyzed and careless in their thinking. They believe: "It's only the winter solstice, and there are still three or four months before the spring sowing season. It's too early to check the seeds now. The state will always find a way to solve it when the time comes..." This idea is wrong. Because whether it is organizing the masses to exchange seeds or transferring them from other places, it requires a series of meticulous work and takes a long time, especially the transfer of seeds from other places, which involves whether the varieties are suitable, the quality is good or bad, the transportation capacity, and the balance of grain and oil. If any aspect of the work cannot keep up, the seeds cannot be supplied to the masses as scheduled. Therefore, the preparation for next year's spring sowing seeds should be arranged in a unified manner and started early, and it is necessary to avoid the passive situation of "temporary solutions".

### 春播种子够不够？好不好？

    春播种子够不够？好不好？
    春播种子够不够？质量如何？这是决定今年春播计划是否能够完成的关键。目前，各地正在积极兴修水利和积肥，有些地方却因此忽视了春播种子的检查工作。这样将造成不良的后果。各地需要在开展以上几项工作的同时，抓紧时机，对今年春播种子的准备情况摸一次底，以免临时发生缺种少种，到处寻找的忙乱被动现象。
    有些干部单纯依靠外地调剂种子，自己不作准备。但是，从外地商品粮中调拨的种子，一般质量较差。如黑龙江省去年春播时水稻缺种，临时从外省调入的稻种不但品种多，质量也不高，大大影响了水稻的产量。
    自从全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布以后，各地都在积极组织农业生产大跃进。原来订的农业生产计划，经过大辩论，都作了适当的修改和提高；增种高产作物和扩大改制面积，超额完成增产指标，也成了农业生产战线上一致奋斗的目标。这样，许多地方准备种子的数量和品种，就不够用了，或是不适合改制后对品种的要求了。例如湖北省今年计划扩大双季稻四百多万亩，省内原来留的种子即供不应求，依靠外省调剂的数量将近一亿多斤。湖南省组织生产大跃进，今年也缺早、晚稻种五千多万斤。可见，在今年新的生产条件下，各地农业社对自留的和国家贮备的春播种子进行一次全面检查，根据各种春播作物的种植计划，切实计算种子的用量，作为准备是极其重要的工作。
    凡是种子数量不足的地区，应在当地党政机关的统一领导和农业、粮食、供销等有关部门的密切配合下，设法调剂解决。在解决缺种的工作中，要贯彻“群众互相串换为主，国家调剂供应为辅”的方针，大力组织群众挖掘种子潜力，以减少国家的负担。去年，河北省很多地区，以乡为单位，召开种子交流会，发动社与社之间进行余缺调剂，互通有无。在调剂方法上，一般采用按质论价，以粮换种、以种换种，差额找齐等互利办法，效果很好。如平安县去年计划种植春播作物十二万多亩，需种四十三万斤，因为灾情重，缺种多，通过上述办法，即串换种子二十多万斤，基本上解决了缺种困难。云南省陆良县去年在蚕豆收获前三个月，即召开了春播和蚕豆种子的调拨会议，开展了小春种子调拨和大春种子的预约繁殖工作，需要种子的乡、社向种子站订立购种合同，因此保证了小春的即时播种。这些省、县解决缺种少种的办法是值得参考的。目前，有些地区的农村干部，思想上还有些麻痹大意。他们认为：“才过冬至，离春播季节还有三、四个月，现在来检查种子，未免为时过早，到时候国家总会想办法解决的……”这种想法是不对的。因为，无论是组织群众串换，或是从外地调拨，都要经过一系列细致工作，需要花费很长时间，尤其是从外地调入种子，牵涉到品种是否适应，品质好坏，交通运输能力、粮食油料的平衡等问题，那一方面工作赶不上，种子就不能如期供应到群众手中。因此，关于明年春播种子的准备，应当统一安排，及早动手，一定要避免“临时抱佛脚”的被动局面。
