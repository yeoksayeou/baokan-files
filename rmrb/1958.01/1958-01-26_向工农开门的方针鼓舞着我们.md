    The Policy of Opening to Workers and Peasants Inspires Us
    Recently, we have continuously seen articles in the People's Daily about schools opening their doors to workers and peasants, and we are deeply moved. The news that nine higher education institutions in Nanjing are preparing to enroll a large number of students from worker and peasant backgrounds this year makes us even more excited!
    Since the liberation of the whole country, the Party has tried in various ways to cultivate a large number of worker and peasant cadres and children of workers and peasants. For example, running worker-peasant rapid middle schools, old cadre cultural supplementary schools, and so on, have achieved remarkable results and cultivated many cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds who are both red and expert. However, if we look at the composition of university students at present, the proportion of workers and peasants is still not large. In schools, the bad habits of bourgeois young masters and misses still exist to varying degrees.
    We are cadres doing Party work in factories. We have seen that among the university students assigned to factories over the years, students from bourgeois families account for the majority. Among them, some have bourgeois ideas of seeking pleasure and comfort, are not at ease in their work, are unwilling to work in more difficult places, and lie down and refuse to work if they don't achieve their goals. Compared with university students from worker and peasant backgrounds, they are really far behind. Of course, some of them also do relatively well in their work. Therefore, we believe that if we want to cultivate qualified cadres who are both red and expert, we must first change the composition of today's university students.
    In short, we wholeheartedly approve of schools opening to workers and peasants. Only when schools open to workers and peasants, only when students from worker and peasant backgrounds occupy a dominant position among the students, can cadres who are wholeheartedly striving for the cause of communism be cultivated.

### 向工农开门的方针鼓舞着我们

    向工农开门的方针鼓舞着我们
    最近我们连续在人民日报上看到关于学校向工农开门的文章，深受感动。南京九所高等院校今年准备大量招考工农成份学生的消息，更使我们兴奋！
    全国解放以来，党设法从各个方面，大量培养工农干部和工农子弟，譬如开办工农速成中学、老干部文化补习学校，等等，取得了显著的成就，培养了不少工农出身的又红又专的干部。但是，如果从目前大学学生的成份来看，工农成份还不多。在学校里少爷、小姐的资产阶级恶劣的习气，依然不同程度地存在着。
    我们是做工厂党的工作的干部。我们看到历年来分配到工厂的大学生，资产阶级家庭出身的学生占了多数。他们之中，有些人存在着资产阶级贪图享乐、安逸的思想，工作不安心，不愿在较艰苦的地方工作，不达目的，躺倒不干。他们和工农出身的大学生比较起来，真是差得很多。当然他们之中也有工作比较好的。因之，我们认为要想培养合格的又红又专的干部，必须首先改变今天大学学生的成份。
    总之，我们对学校向工农开门是举双手赞成的。只有学校向工农开门，只有工农成份的学生在学生中占了优势，才会培养出为共产主义事业衷心奋斗的干部。
