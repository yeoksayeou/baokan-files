To Prevent Land Waste in Construction
    Kunming Municipal Party Committee Stipulates Four Measures
    (Our dispatch from Kunming, January 17th) The Kunming Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is actively taking measures to correct the phenomenon of land waste in capital construction by some units. Currently, twenty-four units have returned 765 mu of barren farmland to agricultural cooperatives for cultivation.

    During the First Five-Year Plan period, some units in Kunming occupied too much farmland, too early, for capital construction. The Yunnan Iron Factory occupied nearly 300 mu of land as early as June 1956, which had been barren for more than a year due to changes in tasks. Among the land occupied by the Kunming Institute of Technology, more than 70 mu have been barren for more than three years. Some units could have built houses on the mountains, but insisted on occupying fertile land. According to statistics from the Yunnan Provincial Construction Bureau, there are fourteen such units, which have occupied 1,048 mu of paddy fields and 144 mu of vegetable land, resulting in the state collecting 1 million fewer jin of grain and 860,000 fewer jin of vegetables each year. The Kunming Railway Bureau even occupied farmland to build staff dormitories without the approval of the Municipal Construction Bureau.

    In order to minimize the waste of farmland, the Kunming Municipal Party Committee recently stipulated several specific measures: (1) In urban construction, strictly implement the policy of "first inside, then outside, filling in the gaps and making it solid" and occupy more mountain slopes and barren land, and less farmland. Strive not to allocate or allocate less of the existing farmland in 1958. (2) Any unit applying for land allocation must have the approval document from the higher-level competent department; after the location is selected, there must be a construction contract signed by the construction unit before boundary stakes are allowed to be placed. (3) Strictly control the building density, with multi-story buildings controlled at 30% to 35% and single-story buildings controlled at 40%. (4) All excessively requisitioned farmland should be immediately cleaned up and returned to the peasants for cultivation. All farmland that is requisitioned early but used late, and cannot be built on this year, should also be returned to the peasants for temporary cultivation. In order to further prevent the waste of farmland, relevant departments should establish a system of regular inspections, and any inappropriate use of farmland should be corrected immediately.

    防止建设中浪费土地
    昆明市委规定四项措施
    本报昆明17日电　中共昆明市委积极采取措施，纠正部分单位在基本建设中浪费土地的现象。目前已经有二十四个单位退出了荒芜的七百六十五亩农田，交给农业社耕种。
    第一个五年计划期间，昆明部分单位在基本建设中过多过早地占用了一些农田。云南铁工厂从1956年6月就占用了近三百亩土地，因为任务变更，一直荒芜了一年多。昆明工学院占用的土地中，有七十多亩已经荒芜三年多。有些单位本来可以上山修建房屋，也坚持要占用良田。据云南省建设局统计，这样的单位有十四个，他们占用了水田一千零四十八亩，蔬菜地一百四十四亩，使国家每年少收粮食一百多万斤，蔬菜八十六万多斤。昆明铁路局甚至不经市建设局批准，径自占用农田修建职工宿舍。
    中共昆明市委为了最大限度地减少浪费农田的现象，最近规定了几项具体措施：（一）在城市建设中严格执行“先内后外，填空补实”和多占山坡荒地、少占农田的方针。争取1958年不拨或少拨现有的农田。（二）凡是申请拨用土地的单位，必须有上级主管部门的批准文件；地点选定以后，必须有施工单位签订的施工合同，才准许钉椿划界。（三）严格控制建筑密度，楼房控制在30％到35％，平房控制在40％。（四）凡是多征用的农田，应即清理退还农民耕种。凡是早征晚用，今年还不能建筑的，也要退还农民暂时耕种。为进一步防止浪费农田的情形发生，有关部门应订出定期检查的制度，发现使用农田不当的情形，应立即纠正。
