Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 16th: Last year, twelve survey and design units in Shanghai, while examining and re-examining design projects, revised and compressed the investment figures for a number of projects, saving the country over 110.7 million yuan in funds.

Some of these design units are responsible for the design of expansion and new construction of electromechanical, chemical, and shipbuilding factories in Shanghai, as well as the design of Shanghai workers' residential areas; others are responsible for the design of mines and factories in other regions. Every year, a large amount of investment has to be specifically allocated through them. Starting from the third quarter of last year, design personnel in these units, following the principles of "building the country with diligence and thrift" and "running enterprises with diligence and thrift," universally reviewed and re-examined the design projects they handled, striving to adopt advanced and economical building structures and technical equipment, and modifying excessively high living welfare facilities, thereby greatly reducing the cost and investment expenses of various projects.

The housing cost standard adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Civil Architecture Design Institute, after revision, has dropped from 52 yuan per square meter to 50 yuan. The pulp washing project designed by the Shanghai Paper Design Institute for the Wuhu Paper Mill, after repeated research, decided to use a suitable "flat vibrating screen" instead of a "rotary drum filter washer." This one improvement alone can save ten valuable concentrators and motors, saving an investment of 290,000 yuan. When designing the Beijing People's Machine Factory project, the Second Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building saved an investment of 1.18 million yuan by using domestically produced equipment instead of imported equipment and reducing some non-essential production equipment.

By improving the factory's process arrangement, design personnel also boldly compressed and modified some non-productive projects and projects that were not absolutely necessary for production. For example, a batch of basic construction projects in the shipbuilding industry saved 37.8% of the total investment as a result. Investments in general industrial construction projects were also reduced by 34.7%.

### 上海勘察设计单位复查设计项目  节省投资一亿一千多万元

    上海勘察设计单位复查设计项目
    节省投资一亿一千多万元
    新华社上海16日电　上海市十二个勘察设计单位，去年在审查和复查设计项目时，修订和压缩了一批工程的投资数字，为国家节省了一亿一千七百多万元资金。
    这些设计单位有的担负着上海市机电、化学、船舶工厂扩建和新建的设计和上海工人住宅区的设计；有的担负着外地矿山、工厂的设计。每年都有大量的投资要从它们手中具体分配出去。去年第三季度开始，这些单位的设计人员根据“勤俭建国”、“勤俭办企业”的方针，普遍审查和复查了自己经手的设计项目，尽力采用先进的经济的建筑结构和技术设备，修改了过高的生活福利部分设施，从而大大地降低了各项工程的造价和投资费用。
    上海市民用建筑设计院采用的住宅造价标准经过修订以后，已从每平方公尺五十二元下降为五十元。上海造纸设计院为芜湖纸厂设计的洗浆工程，经过多次研究后，确定用合用的“平板跳筛”代替“装涤转筛”，只此一项改进，就可以省掉十台贵重的浓缩机和电动机，节约投资二十九万元。第一机械工业部第二设计分局在设计北京人民机器厂的项目时，由于采用国内生产设备代替进口设备和削减了一部分非必需的生产设备，因此也节约了投资一百一十八万元。
    由于改进了工厂的工艺安排，设计人员对某些非生产性的工程和生产上不是十分必需的工程，也进行了大胆的压缩修改。如船舶工业方面的一批基本建设项目，就因此节约了整个投资的37.8％。一般性工业建筑项目的投资也节约了34.7％。
