Many universities and colleges across the country, in conjunction with rectification work, are implementing the policy of running schools through diligence and thrift. They have exposed wasteful phenomena in areas such as basic construction, teaching equipment, and land use, and have begun to formulate improvement measures.

In terms of basic construction, many universities and colleges have paid attention to saving investment and reducing costs when compiling their 1958 basic construction plans. However, some universities and colleges have not sufficiently tapped the potential of existing funds, and there are still extravagant and wasteful phenomena such as demanding excessive standards, excessive scale, pursuing novelty, completeness, and emphasizing symmetry. Some schools have already built classrooms, laboratories, teaching buildings, and dormitories according to the maximum development scale, which is currently sufficient for use (and in some cases, there is even surplus). However, instead of making reasonable adjustments and using them, they are preparing to build other rooms. Since its establishment, East China Normal University has expanded its school buildings by 6.9 times, and more than 50 households and more than 200 rooms in the dormitories are vacant. However, some faculty and staff still live off-campus, and the public subsidizes their rent every month, causing a double waste. Some schools, in order to emphasize symmetry and pay attention to aesthetics, also want to build rooms that are not urgently needed and are of high quality. The building standards of school buildings in many universities and colleges exceed the local construction standards. In terms of basic construction, Northeast Institute of Technology suffered a loss of 750,000 yuan due to the pursuit of aesthetics and extravagance. At present, some schools have begun to correct these wasteful phenomena in basic construction. Xi'an Institute of Architecture and Engineering reduced the construction standards of family dormitories and instrument repair rooms, which can save 15,000 yuan. Xi'an Normal University originally planned to spend 100,000 yuan to build a covered playground. Later, they converted the construction shed into a simple covered playground, which saved all the money. Although the Ministry of Higher Education approved East China Normal University's basic construction control number for 1958 to be more than 500,000 yuan, the school can stop building houses for one or two years after fully utilizing the potential of the school buildings.

In terms of teaching equipment, judging from the previously exposed situations, the waste is shocking. Some schools do not proceed from the current actual needs, and would rather prepare without using, or prepare more and use less, blindly purchase, causing serious backlog and waste. The Department of Physics of Fudan University purchased a photoelectric automatic recording quartz spectrograph and a grating automatic spectrograph from abroad last year, worth more than 180,000 yuan. Because the research plan has not been determined, it has not been used so far. In recent years, the accumulation and waste of instruments and equipment in the Department of Chemistry of Northeast People's University has totaled more than 180,000 yuan. The warehouse of the Department of Stomatology of Sichuan Medical College is piled with 1,121 pieces of large glass bricks used to mix cement powder, which is enough to use for more than 100 years; it also stores 7,849 dozens of metal film pieces for filling teeth, which are difficult to buy on the market. One dozen can be used for one year, which is enough to use for 7,849 years. According to incomplete statistics from Northwest University from January to September last year, a total of 4,407 pieces of teaching equipment were damaged in the school, worth more than 6,100 yuan. The Organic Group of the Department of Chemistry of Nanjing University ordered 800 grams of D-arabitol from abroad in 1954, which has not been used yet. The high-frequency quenching equipment ordered from abroad by the Metallographic Laboratory of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing of Jiaotong University costs 30,000 to 40,000 yuan for parts alone, but it has been stockpiled and unused since it was purchased. In order to prevent and overcome this wasteful phenomenon, many universities and colleges are currently formulating various management measures, establishing sound property accounts, and seriously handling stockpiled materials on the basis of rectifying laboratory work. According to the extravagant and wasteful phenomena exposed by various schools, the Ministry of Higher Education has required all schools to re-examine and revise this year's foreign order cards.

Since the Ministry of Higher Education issued the "Notice on Checking Land Use and Promptly Returning Surplus Land" to universities and colleges across the country, universities and colleges in Beijing, Shanghai, Changsha, Xi'an and other places have checked the land use situation, returned some land, and determined the number of lands that may be returned this spring. For example, Beijing Medical College, Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, Beijing Mining College, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and other 15 universities and colleges can return 700 acres of land. Tongji University, East China Institute of Chemical Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai Second Normal University and other four schools in Shanghai have returned 110 acres of surplus or temporarily unused land. The Ministry of Higher Education conducted inspections on nine universities and colleges in Xi'an, including Jiaotong University and the Institute of Architectural Engineering. It was found that the area of land requisitioned by these schools exceeded the land quota per student stipulated by the Ministry of Higher Education by 1.8 times. In addition, due to unreasonable arrangements and lack of careful calculations, a total of 1,800 acres of land were wasted, accounting for 38.7% of the total land area. At present, these schools are actively preparing to return the surplus land.

In addition, some universities and colleges have taken various measures to pay attention to saving expenses. Some schools have voluntarily requested to lower the standard of expenses, and have also adjusted the standard and coverage of people's scholarships. Some schools want to gradually reduce public subsidies for the expenses of nurseries and kindergartens. (Attached picture)

Beijing University ignited the fire of anti-waste in the rectification. The science departments sorted out a batch of stockpiled instruments and equipment, which will be allocated to units in need. The first batch of stockpiled instruments and equipment processed was worth more than 130,000 yuan. Staff members of the State Planning Commission are allocating the required instruments and equipment at this school.

    革新办学风气　贯彻勤俭方针
    全国许多高等学校向各种浪费现象开火
    本报讯　全国许多高等学校，结合整改工作，贯彻勤俭办学的方针，揭发了基本建设、教学仪器设备、建筑用地等方面的浪费现象，开始订出改进办法。
    在基本建设方面，不少高等学校在编制1958年基本建设计划时，注意了节约投资，降低造价。但也有部分高等学校对现有资金的潜力挖掘不够，还有要求过高、过大、求新、求全、强调对称等铺张浪费现象。有的学校已经按照最大发展规模建成了目前已足够使用（有的还有多余）的教室、实验室、教学楼、宿舍，但是，他们不但不进行合理调整使用，还准备建筑其他用房。华东师范大学建校以来，校舍扩大了六点九倍，宿舍空了五十多户、二百多间，但是有些教职员还住在校外，每月由公家补贴房租，造成双重浪费。有的学校为了强调对称，注意美观，还要建筑目前并不急需而且质量较高的用房。不少高等学校的校舍建筑都超过了当地的建筑标准。东北工学院在基本建设方面，由于追求美观、铺张所造成的损失就达七十五万元。目前，有些学校已经在着手纠正基本建设中的这些浪费现象。西安建筑工程学院降低眷属宿舍和仪器修配室等房屋的建筑标准，可节约一万五千元。西安师范学院原来准备花费十万元修建一幢风雨操场，后来，他们把工棚改为简易的风雨操场，就把这笔费用全部节省下来。华东师范大学虽经教育部批准1958年基本建设控制数为五十余万元，但是，该校在充分发挥校舍的潜力后，一二年内可以不再建造房屋。
    在教学仪器设备方面，从过去揭发出来的情况看，浪费情况是怵目惊心的。有的学校不从目前实际需要出发，宁可备而不用，或多备少用，盲目购置，造成严重的积压浪费现象。复旦大学物理系去年向国外购置的光电自动记录石英摄谱仪和光栅自动摄谱仪，价值十八万元以上，由于研究计划未确定，至今未曾使用。东北人民大学化学系，近几年来仪器设备的积压和浪费共值十八万多元。四川医学院口腔系的仓库里堆着一千一百二十一块用来调粘固粉的大玻砖，足足够用一百多年；还存放着一种市面上难买到的补牙齿用的金属型片七千八百四十九打，一打可用一年，算起来足够用七千八百四十九年。西北大学从去年1月到9月的不完全统计，全校损坏教学设备四千四百零七件，共值六千一百多元。南京大学化学系有机组在1954年向国外订购D—阿拉伯糖醇八百克，至今尚未用。交通大学机械制造系金相实验室向国外订购的高频淬火设备，单是零件即值三、四万元，但买来以后一直积压未用。为了防止和克服这种浪费现象，目前许多高等学校在整顿实验室工作的基础上，正制订各项管理办法，建立健全的财产账目，严肃认真地处理积压物资。高等教育部已根据各校揭发的铺张浪费现象，要求各校将今年国外订货卡片，重新审查填改。
    自从高等教育部向全国高等学校发出“关于检查用地和从速退出多余土地”的通知以后，北京、上海、长沙、西安等地的高等学校都检查了建筑用地情况，退出了一部分土地和确定了今春可能退出土地的数字。如北京医学院、北京地质勘探学院、北京矿业学院、北京航空学院等十五所高等学校，可以退出七百亩土地。上海市的同济大学、华东化工学院、华东师范大学、上海第二师范学院等四校，退出多余或暂时不用的土地一百一十亩。高等教育部曾对西安地区交通大学、建筑工程学院等九所高等学校进行了检查，发现这些学校征用土地的面积超出高等教育部规定的每个学生用地定额的一点八倍，加上安排不合理和缺乏精打细算，共浪费土地一千八百亩，占用地总数的38.7％，目前这些学校正积极准备退出多余土地。
    此外，有些高等学校已采取各种措施，注意节省开支。有的学校自动要求降低开支标准，对人民助学金的标准和补助面也作了调整。有的学校要把托儿所、幼儿园的费用，逐步做到不再由公家补助。（附图片）
    北京大学在整改中燃起了反浪费之火。理科各系清点出一批积压的仪器设备，将调拨给需要的单位使用。第一批处理的积压的仪器设备就价值十三万多元。国家计划委员会工作人员正在这个学校调拨所需要的仪器设备。
