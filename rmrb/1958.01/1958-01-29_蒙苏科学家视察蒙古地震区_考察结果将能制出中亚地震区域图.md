Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" recently published a dispatch reporting on the inspection by Mongolian and Soviet scientists of the area in Mongolia recently affected by earthquakes.

The dispatch stated that after a rare magnitude 11 earthquake occurred in the Bogdo Mountain area of western Mongolia on December 4th of last year, continuous landslides occurred, collapsing millions of cubic meters of rock. When they went to inspect the area at the end of December, they could clearly see a frightening yellow-smoked dust fog, one to one and a half kilometers high, densely covering the mountain peaks sixty kilometers away from the earthquake area. The scale of the destruction was particularly large. Some mountain peaks burst, and half of them collapsed, forming cliffs hundreds of meters high.

During the inspection, a rumbling roar could be constantly heard in the surrounding area. According to the results of the survey by the Soviet earthquake research department, a major fault was formed in the epicenter. The fault was more than 250 kilometers long and 20 meters wide. Roads and waterways were displaced by three meters along the entire 250-kilometer fault line. Water disappeared in many places, but new rapid rivers, 10 to 12 kilometers long, appeared. In the epicenter on Bogdo Mountain, a deep ditch 15 to 18 meters long appeared, and many cracks developed in all directions, completely changing the face of the mountain. Soviet scientist Florensov, who participated in the inspection, said that according to preliminary calculations, the earthquake's focus was only 20 to 30 kilometers deep. Their survey results will provide new materials for the scientific community. At the same time, after surveying the distribution of earthquake intensity in Mongolia and the adjacent Soviet and Chinese regions, it will be possible to create a seismic regional map of this area of Central Asia. This is of utmost importance for the planning and construction of various basic construction projects.

    蒙苏科学家视察蒙古地震区
    考察结果将能制出中亚地震区域图
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联“消息报”最近发表了一篇通讯，报道了蒙古和苏联科学家考察蒙古不久前发生地震区域的情况。
    这篇通讯说，蒙古西部博格多山区在去年12月4日发生了世界上罕见的十一级地震后，还接连不断地发生了山崩，崩坏了数百万立方公尺的岩石。12月底当他们前去考察的时候，在离地震地区六十公里以外就可以清楚地看到那一带山顶上密布着一公里到一公里半高的可怕的黄烟弥漫的尘雾。破坏的规模特别大。有些山峰爆裂，有一半已经崩溃。形成了几百公尺高的悬崖绝壁。
    考察时，周围地区还可以不断地听到隆隆的轰鸣声。根据苏联地震研究部门考察的结果，发现地震中心区形成了主要断层。断层长达二百五十多公里，宽达二十公尺。在二百五十公里的断层全线上道路和水流都被移动了三公尺。有许多地方的水消失了，但是却新出现了长达十公里至十二公里的湍急的河流。在地震中心博格多山上还出现了一条长达十五公尺到十八公尺的深沟，许多条向各个方向发展的裂缝，把这座山的面貌完全改变了。参加考察的苏联科学家弗洛连佐夫说，根据初步计算，地震震源离地面才不过二十公里到三十公里深。他们的考察结果将给科学界提供新的材料。同时，考察出蒙古境内以及相邻的苏联和中国地区地震强度的分布后，就可以制出中亚细亚这一带的地震区域图。这对于各种基本建设的计划和施工具有极重要的意义。
