Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 15th: The Commander-in-Chief of the Syrian Armed Forces, General Bizri, who is currently visiting Egypt, told reporters from the Cairo "Evening News" today that the United States' conspiracy to undermine the unity of the Syrian National Front in the past few weeks has failed.

He said that other conspiracies will also fail, "because we are very united and cannot be undermined by imperialist conspiracies and agents."

Bizri pointed out that American imperialism is using agents who have not yet been exposed or who have had no connection with the Baghdad Pact or other imperialist plans in the past to confuse and deceive the people. These agents spread rumors saying that the United States had made mistakes in the past, but that it would change its policy towards Arabs in the future. At other times, they attribute all the blame to Dulles alone.

Bizri said, "This is a very dangerous statement, because whether it is Dulles or someone else in Washington, they are serving the interests of imperialism. To place any hope in imperialism is like placing hope in the devil."

Referring to the news that Dulles intends to attend the Baghdad Pact meeting, Bizri said that his approach will not be more fortunate than that of his colleague, American Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson, who visited Istanbul last year.

He said that if the United States stops its conspiracies against Syria, Syrian-American relations can return to normal.

Regarding Syrian-Soviet relations, Bizri said, "This relationship was established after Syria overturned the obstacles and restrictions imposed on its freedom by imperialism. This relationship complies with the United Nations Charter. There is nothing strange or incomprehensible about this relationship, with the exception of the imperialists' views, who always want slaves to obey their orders."

    比兹里将军在开罗说
    美国休想破坏叙利亚人民团结
    苏叙两国的关系符合联合国宪章
    据新华社开罗15日电　正在埃及访问的叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里将军今天对开罗“晚报”记者说，美国在过去几星期中企图破坏叙利亚民族阵线团结的阴谋已经失败了。
    他说，其他阴谋也将失败，“因为我们团结得很好，不是帝国主义阴谋和代理人破坏得了的”。
    比兹里指出，美帝国主义利用那些尚未暴露的或是过去同巴格达条约或帝国主义其他计划没有任何联系的代理人，来迷惑和欺骗人民。这些代理人散播言论说，美国过去犯了错误，但是今后它会改变对阿拉伯人的政策。在另外一些时候，他们又把一切罪咎全部推在杜勒斯一个人身上。
    比兹里说，“这是非常危险的说法，因为不论是杜勒斯还是华盛顿方面的别的人都是为帝国主义利益服务的。对帝国主义寄托任何希望，就像对魔鬼寄托希望一样。”
    比兹里在谈到杜勒斯打算参加巴格达条约会议的消息时说，他这种做法并不会比去年访问伊斯坦布尔的他的同事、美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊走运一些。
    他说，如果美国停止它对叙利亚进行的阴谋的话，叙美关系是能够恢复正常的。
    在谈到叙苏关系时，比兹里说，“这种关系是在叙利亚把帝国主义对它的自由强加的障碍和限制推倒以后建立起来的。这种关系符合于联合国宪章。对于这种关系，并没有什么奇怪或费解的地方，只有帝国主义者的看法是例外，他们总是要奴隶们听从他们的命令的。”
