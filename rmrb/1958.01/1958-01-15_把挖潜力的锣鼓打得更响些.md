Beating the Drums of Digging Potential Louder
　　Qian Yin

Whether there is potential to be tapped in enterprises is a question that seems to be widely debated at present. Some people say that in recent years, campaigns for increasing production and practicing economy have been carried out every year, and potential has been tapped every year, sometimes even several times a year. After so much digging, is there any oil left, and how much oil is there?

Today's news from the Beijing Joint State-Private Tongyi Water Pump Factory in this newspaper gives a resounding answer to the doubters. The Tongyi Water Pump Factory is a small factory that originally produced only more than 1,700 water pumps. Now, with the same manpower and equipment, it has decided to complete a task of 4,000 units. Why do they have such great enthusiasm? In addition to the great inspiration from the national spirit of building socialism, the main reason is that they have confidence, and this confidence comes from fully estimating the various potential forces in the enterprise.

The potential in an enterprise is an objectively existing thing, like a mineral deposit. As long as people pay attention to discovering and digging it, it can be unearthed.

Although people's understanding often lags behind reality, as long as people's active role is vigorously brought into play, changes in things are constantly observed, changing conditions are carefully analyzed, and the laws of motion are grasped, it is possible to foresee the trends of events and greatly reduce the distance between understanding and reality. Facts have proved that the main reason why many people cannot see the production potential of enterprises is that they have not deeply observed and analyzed the reality of production, have not grasped the changes in things, and have not kept up with them all the time, resulting in their understanding often lagging behind reality.

We advocate an active role, but we are by no means advocating subjectivism. We certainly do not want to unrealistically do things that are currently impossible, but we must do our best with the most vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm for what can be done. The potential power of an enterprise exists on the one hand in people and on the other hand in machinery and equipment. Of course, people are the masters of machines. Ultimately, tapping the potential of an enterprise means giving play to the role of people and arousing their enthusiasm. The people are the creators of history, the power of the people is endless, and the enthusiasm of the people is immeasurable. Precisely because of this, the potential power of an enterprise can never be fully tapped.

The rectification movement currently underway in enterprises has created favorable conditions for tapping production potential. Taking advantage of the momentum of the rectification movement to further promote the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and further eliminate obstacles to tap the potential of enterprises is not only promising but very promising.

At present, all factories and mines across the country are using the spirit of promotion to make their enterprises take a big leap forward in 1958. At this moment of great strides forward, some units are placing their hopes on getting more from higher authorities. Of course, it is not impossible for the higher authorities to give more. But where does the higher authority's assistance come from? The funds and materials that the higher authority controls are not falling from the sky, but are the result of active increases in production and adherence to running enterprises diligently and frugally in all aspects. In order to overcome difficulties and for industrial production to catch up with the great leap forward in agriculture, the drums of digging potential in enterprises should be beaten louder.

    把挖潜力的锣鼓打得更响些
    千音
    企业里到底有没有潜力可挖，看来这是当前争论较多的问题。有人说，这几年来，年年搞增产节约运动，年年要挖潜力，甚至有的一年要挖几次，这样的挖法，究竟有没有油水，有多大的油水？
    今天本报发表的北京公私合营同益水泵厂的消息，对怀疑论者做了响亮的答复。同益水泵厂是个小厂子，这个厂原来只生产一千七百多台水泵，现在，人力和设备不变，决定完成四千台的任务。他们为什么会有这么大的干劲？除了全国建设社会主义的促进精神大大地鼓舞了他们以外，主要的，还是由于他们心中有底，这个底就是充分地估计了企业里潜在的各种力量。
    企业里的潜力是一种客观上已经存在的东西，它就像矿藏一样，只要人们注意去发现、去挖掘，就有可能挖掘出来。
    虽然人们的认识常常落后于实际，但是，只要大力发挥人们的能动作用，经常观察事物的变化，仔细地分析变化条件，掌握运动的规律，就可能预见事变的动向，使认识与实际的距离大大地缩小。事实证明，很多人之所以看不到企业的生产潜力，最主要的也就是他们没有深入地去观察和分析生产的实际，没有掌握事物的变化，并且一刻不停地紧赶上去，结果使自己的认识往往落在现实的后面。
    我们提倡能动作用，决不是提倡主观主义。我们决不想入非非地去办一些目前还不可能办到的事情，但对于能够办到的则一定要以最旺盛的革命干劲把它办好。企业里的潜在力量，一方面存在于人的身上，一方面存在于机器设备方面。当然人是机器的主人，归根结底，挖掘企业的潜力，就是要发挥人的作用，发挥人的积极性。人民群众是历史的创造者，人的力量是无穷无尽的，人的积极性也是无法估量的。正由于是这样，企业里的潜在力量永远是挖不完的。
    企业里正在进行整风运动，已经为挖掘生产潜力创造了良好条件。乘整风之风，进一步发扬广大职工的生产积极性和创造性，进一步扫除阻碍，挖掘企业的潜力，不是小有可为而是大有可为。
    目前，全国所有的厂矿企业都在用促进的精神，使本企业在1958年大大地向前跃进一步。在这个大踏步前进的时刻，有的单位却把希望寄托在上级多给东西方面。当然，上面多给一些东西也未尝不可。但是上面的东西又从哪里来呢？上面所掌握的资金和材料，也不是天上掉下来的，而是各个方面积极增产、坚持勤俭办企业的结果。为了克服困难，为了使工业生产赶上农业大跃进，在企业里挖潜力的锣鼓应该打得更响些。
