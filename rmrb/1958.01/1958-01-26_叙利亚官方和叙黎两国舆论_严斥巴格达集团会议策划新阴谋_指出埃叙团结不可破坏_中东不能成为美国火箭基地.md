Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Syrian officials and the press of both Syria and Lebanon have expressed strong indignation in the run-up to the Baghdad Pact's Ankara meeting, accusing the meeting of attempting to plot new conspiracies against Egypt and Syria, and to establish American rocket bases in the member countries of the Baghdad Pact.

The Syrian Minister of State in charge of Information and Propaganda, Akil, said that we believe that the Ankara meeting can only bring new conspiracies against Egypt and Syria. He pointed out that the Baghdad Pact is purely an imperialist treaty.

He assured that Syria and Egypt will adhere to their policy of neutrality, and nothing can force them to abandon this policy.

Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party member of parliament, Malki, said on the 23rd: "The upcoming Ankara meeting is a blatant conspiracy against the union of Syria and Egypt." He also said that unless imperialism is forced to leave the entire Middle East, it will not be able to abandon its aim of opposing free Arab countries.

"Al-Nasr" newspaper published an editorial saying that this meeting would openly plot conspiracies to deal with any plans that might support Arab nationalism, such as the federation of Egypt and Syria. The newspaper said that therefore we must carefully maintain our unity, because unity is in fact a rock, and all conspiracies against us will be crushed when they encounter it.

Mahounk, the editor-in-chief of the Lebanese "Beirut Evening News", published an article pointing out that the purpose of the United States' decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Council meeting is to use money to support the treaty, to supply the member countries of the treaty with rockets, and to link this military bloc with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Mahounk pointed out that after the failure of the "Eisenhower Doctrine", the Americans began to make desperate struggles, trying to strengthen the Baghdad Pact.

Damascus's "Al-Jamahir" newspaper, in commenting on the TASS statement, emphasized the timeliness and importance of this statement exposing the sinister intentions of the Baghdad Pact leaders. The newspaper wrote: The Soviet Union's stern warning should sober up the governments of the Baghdad Pact member states. Now these national governments should understand that these national governments and the United States should bear full responsibility for setting up US atomic weapons and rocket weapons bases on the territories of these countries. The United States is trying to save its own territory from rocket counterattacks, while making the territory of the Baghdad Pact member states subject to counterattacks.

    叙利亚官方和叙黎两国舆论
    严斥巴格达集团会议策划新阴谋
    指出埃叙团结不可破坏　中东不能成为美国火箭基地
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在巴格达条约安卡拉会议前夕，叙利亚官方和舆论以及黎巴嫩报纸表示强烈愤慨，指责这个会议企图策划反对埃及和叙利亚的新阴谋。并在巴格达条约成员国建立美国火箭基地。
    叙利亚负责新闻和宣传事务的国务部长阿基勒说，我们认为，安卡拉会议只能带来对付埃及和叙利亚的新阴谋。他指出，巴格达条约纯粹是一个帝国主义性质的条约。
    他保证，叙利亚和埃及都将坚持它们的中立政策，什么东西也不能迫使它们放弃这个政策。
    阿拉伯复兴社会党议员马尔基23日说：“即将举行的安卡拉会议是针对叙利亚同埃及结成联邦的明目张胆的阴谋。”他还说，除非帝国主义被迫离开整个中东，否则它是不可能放弃它反对阿拉伯自由国家的目的的。
    “胜利报”发表社论说，这次会议公然会策划阴谋来对付可能支持阿拉伯民族主义的任何计划，譬如埃及和叙利亚的联邦。这家报纸说，因此我们必须谨慎地保持我们的团结，因为团结实际上就是一块磐石，一切反对我们的阴谋一碰到它都将粉碎。
    黎巴嫩“贝鲁特晚报”总编辑马雄克发表文章指出，美国决定参加巴格达条约理事会会议的目的，是想用金钱来支持这个条约，供给这个条约成员国以火箭，并且想把这个军事集团同北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织联系起来。马雄克指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”破产以后，美国人开始作绝望的挣扎，力图加强巴格达条约。
    大马士革“群众报”在评论塔斯社发表的声明时，强调指出了这项揭露巴格达条约领导人罪恶意图的声明的及时和重要性。这家报纸写道：苏联的严厉警告应该使巴格达条约成员国政府清醒过来。现在这些国家政府应该明白，这些国家政府和美国对在这些国家领土上设置美国原子武器和火箭武器基地应负全部责任。美国力图使本国领土免遭火箭的回击，而使巴格达条约成员国的领土成为遭受回击的对象。
