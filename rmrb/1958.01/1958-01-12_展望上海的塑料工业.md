    Outlook for Shanghai's Plastics Industry

    During the Second Five-Year Plan, Shanghai will develop a comprehensive chemical industry centered on plastics.

    Plastics are compounds made from raw materials such as air, water, coke, and limestone. They have the hardness of metal, the toughness of leather, and the lightness of silk and satin, and can be made into a variety of textiles and daily necessities.

    A number of large-scale chemical plants are now being planned and built in the suburbs of Shanghai; employees of the original chemical plants are also preparing to trial-produce a variety of chemical fibers. During the Second Five-Year Plan, Shanghai's plastic production will increase from 13,000 tons to 58,000 tons, and the number of products will increase from eight to twenty-four. (Attached picture)

    展望上海的塑料工业
    在第二个五年计划期间，上海将发展以塑料为中心的综合化学工业。
    塑料是用空气、水、焦炭、石灰石等原料制成的化合物。它具有金属的坚性、牛皮的韧性，绸缎似的轻盈，可以制成多种纺织品、日用品。
    现在上海市郊正在筹建一批规模巨大的化工厂；原有的化工厂的职工也正在准备试制多种化学纤维。在第二个五年计划期间，上海的塑料产量将由一万三千吨提高到五万八千吨，产品由八种增加到二十四种。（附图片）
