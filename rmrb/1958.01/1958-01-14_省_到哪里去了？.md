Where Did "Economy" Go?
	Zhuang Nong
	Another fire has been lit in the rectification campaign, called the "Anti-Waste Fire." The People's Daily's headline in large characters is "May the Anti-Waste Fire Burn Throughout the Country." It also published an editorial saying, "Waste phenomena in various places and departments are widespread and massive." The purpose of lighting this fire is to "take advantage of the rectification movement" to "achieve twice the result with half the effort" and "burn all kinds of waste clean."
	We originally had a guideline for action in construction called "more, faster, better, and more economical." But in actual practice, many people have ignored the word "economical." Thus, what remains are only some one-sided or even the opposite of "more, faster, better": superficially "more, faster, better," but in reality, "less, slower, worse." Although this was not the original intention of our comrades, it is an undeniable fact.
	How can this be seen?
	Please read on:
	Fudan University's "stored microanalysis combustion tubes can be used for over a hundred years, and stainless steel for twenty years," "four steel analyzers worth 36,000 yuan and a high-pressure autoclave worth 8,800 yuan, and an automatic recording polarograph worth over 6,000 yuan... were all purchased from abroad and cannot be used." This is truly "much," but their utilization rate, calculated annually, is only 1%, one-twentieth, or even "zero," which is not "little" and pathetic.
	"Leading cadres of the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory produced more than 1,900 units when the new product was initially tested successfully, but many problems had not been resolved." This is certainly "fast." But the result is that "the vast majority have problems and cannot be used, requiring modification." This is actually slower.
	As for things turning from "good" to "bad," there are even more examples. During the reconstruction of the Tongchuan No. 1 Coal Mine, there was a so-called "thoroughly innovative method." Everything new certainly looks better than half-old and half-new; however, the result was "spending more money and accomplishing less," and the original facilities were also abandoned. This, of course, becomes not good. The Wangjiahe No. 1 mine was built on a thin coal seam and had to be "large," with an annual output of 450,000 tons. It is said that "the leaders thought this would produce more coal." "Being able to produce more coal" is certainly a good thing; however, the result was "slow coal production" and "high costs." This, of course, is bad.
	So where did "economy" go? Has it really been thoroughly eliminated by these people? The answer is, it is still there; but it has not been used in these events, but has been diverted by those comrades to their own minds.
	How can this be seen?
	Please read on:
	The People's Daily's editorial quoted a passage from Chairman Mao: "It is necessary to make all cadres and all people constantly think that our country is a large socialist country, but also an economically backward and poor country. This is a major contradiction. To make our country rich and strong, it will take decades of arduous struggle, including a thrifty and industrious national construction policy of practicing strict economy and opposing waste." I believe that "large population" is the biggest characteristic of our big country, so the Party calls on us to proceed from the 600 million population in everything. A large population and poverty is naturally a big contradiction. However, some people simply do not "think about" it, fearing to "think about" it; because to "think about" it and to "constantly think about" it requires understanding the situation, investigating and researching, using brains and thinking; and after thinking, it is necessary to take some measures to spend less money and accomplish more, which requires mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and relying on the masses. In short, this is very troublesome. So, they diverted the word "economy" and didn't even "think" about it.
	People who "constantly think about" it will clearly establish a "thrifty and industrious national construction policy" in their minds, while people who do not "think about" it will naturally "lack the thought of thrifty and industrious national construction" in their minds. However, thoughts cannot be blank, so thoughts such as "greed for large and new," "stockpiling more and using less," "stressing pomp and grandeur," "a big family and a big business, being rich and powerful... not cherishing national property at all," "only caring about production, not caring about quality and cost; only managing regardless of profit and loss," etc., are crowded into the minds of these comrades, making it impossible to squeeze in those things that should be "constantly thought about."
	So, I have some enlightenment again. Not only should "the anti-waste fire burn throughout the country," but it should also burn on everyone, in everyone's mind; not only should "various waste phenomena be burned clean," but also those things crowded in the mind and the diverted "economy" should be burned clean, making room to put that "contradiction" in, so that in the future, we will "constantly think about" it. Only then can a "thrifty and industrious national construction policy" truly appear in the mind. Otherwise, just shouting about economy will not solve the problem. Wasn't it precisely because the warehouse keeper of the Tianjin Cultural Supplies Purchasing and Supply Station wanted to "save warehouse space" that he "horizontally placed and stacked" a batch of reed organs, making them unsellable?
	A large country, a large population, and poverty, this is a contradiction; not admitting this poverty, but instead thinking "a big family and a big business, being rich and powerful," this will further expand this contradiction; to overcome this contradiction, it is necessary to first eliminate the view of not admitting poverty. This is to make everyone understand that precisely because we have a large population and are poor, we should spend less money and accomplish more, and accomplish it quickly and well. And this is precisely the true thing that should be born from the anti-waste fire.

### “省”到哪里去了？

    “省”到哪里去了？
    庄农
    整改中又烧起了一把火，叫作“反浪费之火”。人民日报的大字标题是“愿反浪费之火燃遍全国”。还发了社论，说“各个地方和各个部门中的浪费现象是普遍的大量的”。烧起这把火的目的，就是要“乘整风运动之风”，以“收事半功倍之效”，“把各种浪费烧个干净”。
    我们在建设上原有一个行动的方针，叫作“多、快、好、省”。可是在实际行动中，有许多人把“省”字忽略了。于是剩下的便只是些片面的甚至是反面的“多、快、好”：表面上是“多、快、好”，实质上是“少、慢、坏”了。尽管这并不是我们这些同志的原意。但却是不可否认的事实。
    何以见得？
    请往下看：
    复旦大学“储存的微量分析燃烧管可用一百年以上，不锈钢可用二十年”，“价值三万六千元的四架析钢仪和值八千八百元的一台高压釜，值六千多元的自动记录极谱仪……都是从国外购来，无法使用”。这真是“多乎哉”，然而它们的使用率，以年来计算，有的只是1％，有的二十分之一，有的甚至是“零”，岂不又“少”得可怜。
    “天津内燃机厂的领导干部，在新产品初步试验成功，但还有许多问题没有得到解决的时候，就生产了一千九百多台”。这当然“快”的很。但结果“绝大部分有毛病不能用，需要改装”。这其实又是慢了的。
    至于“好”变“坏”的事就更多一些，铜川第一煤矿改建中，有所谓“彻头彻尾革新的办法”，全新看起来当然比半旧半新好；然而结果却是“多花了钱少办了事”，原有的设施也都废置了。这当然变成不好了。王家河一号矿井建在薄煤层上，也要“大”到年产四十五万吨，据说“领导人员以为这样就能多出煤”，“能多出煤”当然又是好事；然而结果却是“出煤慢”又“成本高”。这当然又是坏了。
    那末“省”到哪里去了呢？它果真已被这些人彻头彻尾的消灭了么？答曰，它还在的；不过并没有被使用在这些事件上，而是被那些同志们挪用到自己脑子里去了。
    何以见得？
    请再往下看：
    人民日报的社论引了毛主席的一段话：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”我以为“人多”又是我们这大国的最大特征，所以党又号召我们，一切从六亿人口出发。人多又穷，自然是一个很大的矛盾。但是，有些人偏偏不“想到”，怕“想到”；因为“想到”而且要“经常想到”，是要了解情况、调查研究、花脑筋、用思想；而且想到之后，还要采取一些少花钱多办事的办法，那又得要去发动群众、组织群众、依靠群众，总之这是很费事的。于是便把那个“省”字就挪用了来。连“想”也不想了。
    “经常想到”的人，脑子里就会明确树立一个“勤俭建国的方针”，而不“想到”的人，脑子里自然就“缺乏勤俭建国的思想”。然而思想又不能空白，于是“贪大求新”、“多备少用”、“讲求排场和气派”、“家大业大，财大气粗……对国家财产毫不爱惜”、“只顾生产，不顾质量和成本；只管经营不管盈亏”等等思想，便在这些同志脑壳里挤的满满的，使得应该“经常想到”的那些，挤也挤不进去。
    于是我便又有所悟。不仅要“反浪费之火燃遍全国”，而且还要燃到每个人身上，每个人脑子里去；不仅要“把各种浪费现象烧个干净”，而且要把挤在脑子里的那些东西以及挪用来的“省”也都烧个干净，腾出地方来把那个“矛盾”安置进去，这样今后才会“经常想到”。也才能在脑子里真正出现“一个勤俭建国的方针”。否则只嚷节约，也还不能解决问题。天津文化用品采购供应站的仓库保管员，不就是为了“节约仓库地位”，才把一批风琴“横置倒放堆码”，弄得卖不出去了的吗？
    国大、人多而穷，这是一个矛盾；不承认这穷，反而认为“家大业大，财大气粗”，这就会更加扩大这个矛盾；要克服这个矛盾必先去掉不认穷的观点。这就是要使人人都明白，唯其我们人多又穷，所以更要少花钱多办事，而且要办得又快又好。而这正是应该从反浪费之火里所诞生的真正的东西。
