Xinhua News Agency, Xining - In the freezing temperatures of over twenty degrees below zero Celsius, the herdsmen of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province are intensely carrying out livestock pregnancy preservation and fattening work. More than 3,678,000 head of livestock in the prefecture have been safely transferred to winter pastures.

Last year, the Hainan area had abundant water and grass. A large number of cadres went to the pastoral areas in the summer and autumn to lead the fattening work and promptly treated more than 900,000 sick animals suffering from sheep pox, bovine pleuropneumonia, and sheep scabies. Before winter, they organized herdsmen inside and outside the pastoral cooperatives to cut grass and build enclosures, cutting more grass than in any previous year. The herdsmen universally repaired cold-proof livestock pens. For example, the Lighthouse First Cooperative in Xinghai County built two sheep pens and one cattle and horse pen each.

After the livestock entered the winter pastures, each pastoral cooperative and mutual aid group divided them into groups for feeding based on their size and fatness. Advanced feeding experiences such as herding closely, preventing crowding, slow driving, avoiding eating frosted grass, and not drinking water in the morning and evening were promoted. Old, weak, and young animals were supplemented with fried noodles, hemp bran, and other feeds. Herdsmen outside the cooperatives also organized temporary mutual aid groups for wintering.

Currently, the peak lambing season has arrived, and the herdsmen are full of confidence in ensuring that livestock safely survive the snow and blizzard disaster period.

In order to better carry out epidemic prevention and livestock protection work, the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has trained a total of 1,080 Tibetan folk veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel in the past three years. These Tibetan veterinary technicians were trained by Han Chinese full-time veterinarians through short-term training courses and leading internships. They have played a significant role in epidemic prevention and livestock protection work. Last year, the prefecture treated more than 900,000 livestock of various kinds, of which Tibetan folk veterinarians treated more than 570,000. In Guinan County, where the foundation of prevention and control work is relatively good, each folk veterinarian treated an average of 1,700 livestock last year.

The Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is currently actively training Tibetan veterinary personnel, planning to train another 6,000 people within five years to meet the needs of great production development.

    作好牲畜保胎保膘工作
    海南藏族自治州牲畜安全转入冬季牧场
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省海南藏族自治州的牧民在摄氏零下二十多度的严寒中，紧张地进行着牲畜保胎保膘工作。全州三百六十七万八千多头牲畜已经安全地转入冬季牧场。
    去年海南地区水草丰美，大批干部曾在夏秋两季到牧区领导抓膘工作，并且及时防治了患有羊痘、牛肺疫、羊疥癣等的九十多万头病畜。入冬前，他们又组织牧业社内和社外牧民打草打圈，打的草比以往任何一年都多。牧民们普遍修了御寒的畜圈。如兴海县灯塔一社打了羊圈两个，牛圈、马圈各一个。
    牲畜进到冬季牧场以后，各牧业社和互助组根据牲畜的大小和膘情作了分群饲养。推广了跟群放牧、防挤、慢赶、不吃霜草、晨昏不饮水等先进饲养经验。对老弱幼畜用炒面、麻碴等饲料进行了补饲。社外牧民也组织了过冬临时互助组。
    目前接羔旺季来到了，牧民们满怀信心地保证使牲畜安全度过风雪灾害期。
    为了更好地作好防疫保畜工作，海南藏族自治州三年来共培养训练了藏族民间兽医和防疫员一千零八十人。这些藏族兽医技术人员是由汉族专职兽医人员用开办短期训练班、带领实习等形式培养起来的。他们在防疫保畜工作中起了很大作用。去年全州防治各种牲畜九十多万头，其中藏族民间兽医防治的就有五十七万多头。防治工作基础较好的贵南县，去年平均每个民间兽医人员防治牲畜一千七百头。
    海南藏族自治州目前仍在积极培养训练藏族兽医人员，计划在五年内再培养六千人，以适应生产大发展的需要。
