    Six Nights of Battle
    Shi Gang, Liping
    The sky was clear of clouds, and nearly two and a half months had passed without a drop of rain. Old Hu, the Communist Party branch secretary of Linjiang Township in Echeng, Hubei Province, stared blankly at the boundless drought-stricken land, his brow furrowed with worry.
    Speaking of Luziwan in Linjiang Township, everyone would say, "It's a good place, the land is flat, with the Yangtze River behind and a lake in front." But the water conservancy conditions were poor, three days of rain would turn it into a vast lake, and half a month of drought would create a sandstorm. People watched helplessly as the water in the Yangtze River flowed away, while the water in the lake was difficult to pump up – to pump lake water, it required more than twenty stages and a three-mile haul.
    The Party branch committee held a special meeting to discuss drought resistance and winter planting.
    "What do we do when dry land prevents planting?"
    "Can we try to draw water from the Yangtze River?" someone suggested.
    Branch Secretary Old Hu pondered for a while and said, "Yes! We can draw it in!"
    "How?"
    "Dig a long canal along the river embankment and use pumps to lift the water over the embankment. Then we can irrigate more than three thousand mu of land in the entire cooperative."
    The branch committee agreed with this idea. But making it happen was not so simple.
    The next day, the news about building the long canal spread, and people were so excited! For days, the cooperative members discussed the plan to build the long canal and draw water from the Yangtze River. Sixty-year-old Shen Lao Die pulled Branch Secretary Old Hu aside and said, "Since the beginning of time, no one has ever heard of drawing water from the Yangtze River to irrigate fields." After calculating the detailed account of increased production that opening the canal could bring, the masses agreed to the plan. But the canal had to pass through Auntie Yu's doorstep, and she was afraid of damaging the "feng shui," so she initially disagreed with the canal passing through her doorway. Later, after everyone's explanation, her old mind also opened up.
    Because the autumn harvest was too busy, it was decided to start work at night. The old women couldn't dig or carry, so every night, everyone sent a lamp, more than eight hundred lamps from the whole cooperative. They dug the soil, and the women stood beside them holding the lamps. The five-guarantee household, Grandma Yuan, also came. Someone said, "Grandma: You use this oil, and you can get a receipt and be reimbursed by the cooperative!" She said, "You are not really enlightened, construction is everyone's business, what does this little bit of oil count for? A duck laying one extra egg a day is enough."
    Female teacher Zheng Yunying was a young girl who had just stepped out of school and had never done farm work before, but this time she also joined the group of female cooperative members, working until her feet were blistered.
    The sixth night of battle passed, and the canal was completed.
    The workers used trucks to transport the pumps and installed them on the riverbank at the foot of Huangbai Mountain. The motors roared, and a stream of water gushed out of the iron pipes, flowing from west to east along the canal that people had dug, through the forests, through the villages, towards the vast fields...
    "The water is here!" A burst of laughter echoed across the fields. The people who were working swarmed towards the canal, and an old man excitedly cupped a handful of water and smeared it on his mouth: "Children! This is the Yangtze River water that we have drawn in ourselves!"

    六个战斗的黑夜
    石岗　力平
    天空中万里无云，将近两个半月没下一滴雨了。湖北鄂城临江乡中共支部书记老胡，望着一望无边的干旱的土地发愁得发呆。
    一提起临江乡的芦子湾，谁都会说，这是好地方，地一崭平，后面是江，前面是湖；可就是水利条件不好，连下三天雨就成了四海湖，一干上半个月，又成了飞沙阵。人们眼巴巴地望着大江里的水跑了，而湖里的水又很难车上来——要车湖水，得车二十多节，翻三里路。
    党的支委会专门开会讨论抗旱进行冬种的问题。
    “干地不能播种怎么办？”
    “看看能不能把大江的水引来呢？”有人提醒说。
    支部书记老胡沉思了一会，也说：“能！能引进来！”
    “怎么引法？”
    “沿江堤开一条水渠，用抽水机把水翻到堤这面来，全社三千多亩地都能灌。”
    支委会同意了这个意见。可是要做成这件事并不那么简单。
    第二天，关于修长渠的消息传开了，人们多么兴奋啊！一连几天，社员们都在讨论修长渠引江水的计划。六十多岁的沈老爹，拉着支书老胡说：“自从盘古开天地，没有听说引大江水来灌田。”算过开渠可以增产的细帐以后，群众同意了这个计划。可是水渠要从余大娘的门口过，她怕挖坏了“风水”，开头不同意从她门口开渠，后来经过大家解释，她的老脑筋也开了。
    由于收秋挤在一起忙不过来，决定夜间动工。老婆婆们挖不动，挑不动，每到天黑，人人送上一盏灯，全社送了八百多盏，别人挖土，她们就在旁边端上灯。五保户袁大婆也来了，别人说：“大婆：点了这些油，你打个条子找社里报销！”她说：“你们真不觉悟，办建设是大家的事，用这点油算什么？鸭子一天多生一个蛋就够了。”
    女老师郑云英是个刚跨出校门的小姑娘，从小也没做过庄稼活，这次也钻进了女社员群中，干得脚上起了泡。
    第六个战斗的黑夜过去了，渠修成了。
    工人用汽车搬来了抽水机，把它安装在黄白山脚下的河边，马达啸起了轰轰轰的响声，一股水从铁管中冒出来，顺着人们开出的渠道从西往东流，穿过丛林，穿过村庄，向辽阔的田野上流去……
    “水来啦！”田野上一片欢笑声。正在做活的人们一窝蜂的朝着渠道边涌去，有一个老头子兴奋地用双手捧起一捧水往嘴上一抹：“孩子们！这是咱们自己引来的江水。”
