    A school-wide winter sports activity—the "Hundred-Day Exercise"—has become a craze at the Beijing Mining Institute.
    In the quiet campus in the early morning, only gusts of cold wind blow. The 6:20 AM bell, tense and powerful, sends out the signal for the start of the day, breaking the morning silence and arousing a burst of lively noise: "Exercise for health! Build the motherland! Overcome the severe cold! Persist in exercising!..." The loud slogans are inspiring. The darkness of the night has not completely disappeared, and the courtyard is vaguely visible, only people are seen, not faces. "Second group, assemble!..." "Fifth group, start running!..." The students followed the voice of the group leader, found their teams, and started running according to their plans.
    It seems that long-distance running is the most popular sport in winter at the Beijing Mining Institute. In an instant, the long-distance running team formed layers of human walls, which kept turning, with the representative team being the fastest. But the girls with their two little braids were not showing any weakness, they were also running lap after lap. Those overweight students found it a bit difficult to run, but their will was strong, one thousand meters, two thousand meters, some even ran five thousand meters in one morning. They had a plan to run from "fat" to "strong". Those young and strong lads ran easily and happily, and one after another overtook the girls on the track. They ran more and more vigorously. The playground is ultimately a playground with a 400-meter track, and there are more and more people, three to four thousand people, and the playground cannot accommodate them. It is more convenient to run long-distance on the roads in the campus. Yes, the roads have long been arranged into long snake formations, without heads or tails, one line after another.
    No! There is an even more lively place, and that is the apparatus field. Row upon row of horizontal bars and parallel bars, surrounded by dense crowds of people...one...two..., come on!...two more and you'll reach excellent!.... There are always two or three students hanging on the bars, bending the bars again and again, doing pull-ups or arm flexions and extensions up and down. This is the physical strength project in the "Hundred-Day Exercise".
    Looking at the weightlifting field, those light and heavy barbells are going up and down, rising and falling non-stop. The girls skipping rope next to them swing the rope round and round, single jumps, double jumps, with many variations. All of this broke the silence in every corner of the sports field....
    A few colorful clouds hang in the east, and the campus is full of vigorous vitality. But even more full of vitality are those young girls and lads who are being tempered into steel. (Attached picture)

    百日锻炼中的一个早晨
    丁慧
    一个全校性的冬季体育活动——“百日锻炼”在北京矿业学院已经形成热潮。
    清晨寂静的校院里，只有吹来的阵阵寒风。六点二十分的电铃，紧张有力地发出了一天开始的信号，它冲破了清晨的寂静，唤起了一片热闹的喧声：“锻炼身体！建设祖国！战胜严寒！坚持锻炼！……”。响亮的口号，激动着人心。夜的黑暗还没有全部消失，院子里模模糊糊，只见人不见面。“第二组集合，……”“第五组开始跑啦！……”同学们追踪着组长的声音，找到了队伍，按照自己的计划，跑起来了。
    看来长跑在北京矿业学院已经是冬季最受人欢迎的运动。刹那间，长跑队伍形成了一层层的人墙，它不停地转动，其中代表队的速度最快。可是摆动着两只小辫子的姑娘们一点也不示弱，她们也是跑了一圈又一圈。那些体胖的同学跑起来，实在有点吃力，但他们的意志坚强，一千公尺，两千公尺，有的一个早晨就跑五千公尺。他们有个打算，要把“胖”跑成“壮”。那些年轻力壮的小伙子们，跑的轻松愉快，跑道上的姑娘们被他们一个又一个地赶过了。他们越跑越起劲。操场终究是四百公尺跑道的操场，人越来越多啦，三、四千人，操场是容不下的。校院内的各条马路，跑长跑更便当。是的，马路上早已摆成了长蛇阵，就是没有头尾，一行接着一行。
    不！还有更热闹的地方，那就是器械场。一排一排的单双杠，它们的四周，都围着密密麻麻的人群，……一个，……两个……，加油！……再来两个就达到优秀啦！……。杠子上总是吊着两三个同学，把杠子压的弯又弯，又上又下地作引体向上或双臂屈伸。这是“百日锻炼”中的体力项目。
    再看举重场，那些轻的、重的杠铃，上上下下，起落不停。旁边跳绳子的姑娘，把绳子抡得圆又圆，单跳，双跳，变化多端。所有这一切都冲破了运动场每个角落的寂静……。
    东方挂起了几缕彩霞，校院内充满了蓬勃的朝气。但是更充满朝气的，还是那些百炼成钢的年青的姑娘和小伙子们。（附图片）
