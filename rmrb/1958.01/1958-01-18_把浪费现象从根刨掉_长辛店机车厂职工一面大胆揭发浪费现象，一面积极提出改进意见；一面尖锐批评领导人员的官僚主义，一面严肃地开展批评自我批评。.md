    Eradicating Waste from the Root
    Workers at the Changxindian Locomotive Factory are boldly exposing waste, actively proposing improvement suggestions, sharply criticizing the bureaucracy of leading personnel, and earnestly conducting self-criticism.
    This newspaper reports: In order to catch up with or surpass the advanced indicators of fraternal factories across the country this year, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has launched a large-scale special rectification campaign against waste. According to statistics from January 12th to 15th, more than twenty workshops and work sections in the factory held anti-waste exhibitions, displaying more than one thousand kinds of wasted materials and supplies. Workers also posted more than seven hundred big-character posters, exposing more than two thousand instances of waste. According to the materials currently revealed, the state funds wasted in the locomotive and passenger car workshops alone amounted to more than 250,000 yuan in one year. The phenomenon of idle funds in this factory is also quite serious, with a total of 2.29 million yuan in idle funds, accounting for two-thirds of the enterprise's entire circulating funds, resulting in more than 10,000 yuan in interest payments each month.
    While exposing waste, workers actively put forward constructive improvement suggestions. For example, passenger car workshop worker Ma Xiang, under the title "An Astonishing Figure," suggested that the second-layer floor of passenger cars does not need to be oiled, provided that quality is ensured. This one item alone could save the workshop more than 1,000 yuan in material costs per year. Another example is the old worker Nan Dianchen, who wrote in a big-character poster: Passenger car water tank cleaning holes are all made of copper, but in fact they can be changed to iron, which would not only save a large amount of non-ferrous metals, but also save more than 9,000 yuan per year. A big-character poster from the materials section said that the sand casting workshop currently uses more than 70 tons of charcoal per year, worth 18,000 yuan, but in fact coke and Yangquan coal can be used instead. Adopting this measure could save at least 15,000 yuan per year. Another big-character poster was titled: "Can we save 100,000 yuan?" It turned out that the silica sand used in the factory's sand casting workshop was purchased from remote places such as Xiangtan, etc. The workshop uses 3,000 tons of silica sand per year, and the purchase price plus freight costs amount to 199,500 yuan per year. The poster suggested sourcing materials locally, and if purchased from Qikeshu in the Northeast, more than 129,000 yuan could be saved per year.
    Workers also conducted mutual criticism. For example, some workers in the passenger car workshop drew a cartoon criticizing dismantling workers for kicking down the wind canopies from a high place when dismantling cars, in order to be quick and pursue piecework wages. As a result, some steel bars were broken, and some were bent out of shape; workers in the next process had to spend two or three days straightening and welding these broken and bent parts, which wasted both time and materials. There was also a cartoon criticizing paint workers for wasting paint, depicting paint workers not using brushes to paint the car body, but instead lifting up the paint barrel and pouring it on. Below this painting was also written a jingle: "Paint comrades are highly skilled, don't use a brush, use a barrel to spill, wasting paint, an awful bill!"
    Some workers, while criticizing the bureaucracy of leaders for causing waste, also conducted self-criticism based on their own responsibilities. For example, Han Zhe, foreman of the boiler workers in the power workshop, exposed the phenomenon of coal waste in the boiler squad, and said that in the past, the leadership had helped them learn Sun Shousong's advanced coal burning method from the Harbin Railway Factory, but because they only cared about saving their own energy, they still added coal to the boiler with large shovels. He promised to lead the entire squad to add less coal and more frequently. If they insisted on doing so, they could save the country three to four hundred tons of coal a year. Zhang Hongchao, a paint worker in the passenger car workshop, used to not sift gypsum powder when mixing putty in order to save trouble, which resulted in the scrapping of entire buckets of putty because of sand particles. When he saw the waste product he had created himself at the anti-waste exhibition this time, he felt very sad. The next day, he went to the workshop leaders to make a self-criticism and promised not to produce any more waste products in the future.
    This factory has been exposing, examining, and correcting problems simultaneously in its anti-waste campaign. After waste phenomena were exposed in the workshops, workers and cadres immediately studied the causes of waste and methods to plug loopholes, and made immediate corrections where possible. On the 13th, workers from the passenger car workshop, together with the chief engineer and the resident acceptance inspector, studied methods to overcome waste and solved six major waste problems in one afternoon, which could save the country more than 13,000 yuan within a year.
    Currently, the factory's special rectification campaign against waste is developing in depth. The factory's Party committee has proposed to all employees that the principle of running enterprises diligently and frugally should take root in the factory through this campaign. In addition, they also plan to use the small-scale exhibitions in the workshops as a regular educational tool to oppose waste, in order to remind employees to pay attention to opposing waste and maintain a frugal style.

    把浪费现象从根刨掉
    长辛店机车厂职工一面大胆揭发浪费现象，一面积极提出改进意见；一面尖锐批评领导人员的官僚主义，一面严肃地开展批评自我批评。
    本报讯　长辛店机车车辆修理工厂为了在今年内赶上或超过全国各兄弟厂的先进指标，在整改中掀起了一个声势浩大的反浪费的专题鸣放。据12日到15日的统计，全厂有二十多个车间和工段举办了反浪费的展览会，展出浪费的器材和物资一千多种。职工们还贴出了七百多张大字报，揭发了两千多件浪费事实。根据目前揭发出的材料，仅机车和客车两个车间，在一年内浪费的国家资金即达二十五万元以上。这个厂积压资金的现象也相当严重，现在共积压资金二百二十九万元，占企业整个流动资金的三分之二，每个月为此付出的利息达一万多元。
    职工们在揭发浪费现象的同时，积极地提出了建设性的改进意见。如客车车间工人马骧以“一笔惊人的数字”为题，提出在保证质量的前提下，客车二层地板可以不必涂油的建议。仅此一项，这个车间一年内可以节省一千多元的材料费。又如老工人南殿臣在一张大字报上写道：客车水箱清扫孔都是铜制的，事实上可以改用铁制，这样不仅可以节省大量的有色金属，而且每年可以节约九千多元。材料科的一张大字报上说，目前翻砂车间每年要用七十多吨木炭，价值一万八千元，事实上完全可以用焦炭和阳泉煤代替。采用这项措施，每年至少可以节约一万五千元。还有一张大字报的标题是：“能不能省下十万元？”原来这个厂翻砂车间所用的硅砂，是从遥远的湘潭等地买来的，这个车间每年要用三千吨硅砂，连购价加运费，每年的支出就是十九万九千五百元。他建议就近取材，如果到东北七棵树去买，一年可节约十二万九千多元。
    职工和职工之间也相互开展了批评。如客车车间有的工人画了一幅漫画，批评拆车工在拆车风棚时，为了图快追求计件工资，由很高的地方，一脚将风棚踹下来，结果有的钢筋摔断了，有的钢筋摔得七歪八扭；下一道工序的工人，费上两三天的时间才能把这些断了的、扭歪了的部件调直焊好，这样既浪费了时间，又浪费了材料。还有一张批评油漆工人浪费油漆的漫画，画面上画着油漆工在油刷车身时，不是用刷子刷，而是掀起油筒往上面倒。在这幅画的下面还写了一段顺口溜：油工同志窍门高，不用刷子用桶倒，浪费了油漆不知多多少！
    有的职工在批评领导方面官僚主义造成浪费的同时，也根据自己应负的责任作了自我检查。例如，动力车间司炉工长韩哲揭发了司炉班浪费煤炭的现象，并且说，过去领导方面曾经帮助我们学习过哈尔滨铁路工厂孙寿松的先进烧煤法，但是由于我们只顾自己省力气，仍然是大锹大锹往锅炉里添煤。他保证今后要带领全班同志做到少添勤添。如果坚持这样做的话，一年可以为国家节省三四百吨煤。客车车间油工张鸿超，过去干活为了省事，和油腻子时不筛石膏粉，结果因为里面有砂粒，使整桶的油腻子报废了。当他这次在反浪费展览会上看到自己亲手造成的废品时，心里很难过。第二天，他就找车间领导人员作了检讨，并保证今后不出废品。
    这个厂在反浪费中作到了边揭发边检查边改正。车间里揭发出浪费现象以后，工人和干部立即共同研究造成浪费的原因和堵塞漏洞的办法，能改的马上就改。13日，客车车间的工人和总工程师、驻厂验收员共同研究克服浪费的办法，一下午就解决了六项重大的浪费问题，一年之内就可以为国家节约一万三千多元。
    目前，这个厂的反浪费专题鸣放正在向纵深发展。工厂党委向全体职工提出，要通过这次大鸣大放，把勤俭办企业的方针在工厂里扎下根来。另外，他们还打算把车间里的小型展览会，作为一种经常反对浪费现象的教育工具，以便及时地提醒职工注意反对浪费，保持节约的风尚。　（建群、学勤）
