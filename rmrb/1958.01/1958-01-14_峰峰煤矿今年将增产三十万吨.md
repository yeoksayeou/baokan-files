Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, January 13th. In discussing the national plan, workers at the Fengfeng Coal Mine, implementing the spirit of the rectification campaign, proposed to increase raw coal production by 300,000 tons for the entire year. The mine's total coal production this year will increase by 18% compared to the actual production level of 1957, while the original plan approved by the state only aimed for a 9% increase compared to the 1957 level.

After the rectification campaign in some units of the Fengfeng Coal Mine, the class consciousness of the workers has been raised to an unprecedented level, with attendance rates frequently reaching over 90%, and new records constantly emerging. According to an analysis by the CCP Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee, the current potential in production is enormous. With the comprehensive and in-depth development of the rectification movement, the improvement of leadership style and production management, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers will be further manifested. However, some cadres believe that the national plan has just been finalized, and proposing an increase in production immediately seems "premature," "lacking sufficient basis," and that "failure to complete it would dampen the enthusiasm of the workers," etc. During the discussion, these backward and conservative ideas were criticized. Currently, all mines under the Mining Bureau are arranging and revising first-quarter production targets based on their specific circumstances.

    峰峰煤矿今年将增产三十万吨
    新华社保定13日电　峰峰煤矿职工在讨论国家计划中贯彻整风精神，提出今年全年要增产原煤三十万吨的计划。今年全矿的产煤量将比1957年的实际生产水平提高18％，而原来经过国家批准的计划只比1957年水平提高9％。
    峰峰煤矿的一些单位经过整风，职工群众的阶级觉悟已空前提高，出勤率经常达到90％以上，新纪录不断出现。据中共峰峰矿务局委员会分析，当前生产中的潜力是巨大的，随着整风运动全面深入的开展，领导作风和生产管理的改进，工人的积极性、创造性将会更加表现出来。但是也有一些干部认为国家计划刚刚定下来，马上提出增产似乎“为时过早”、“根据不充分”、“一旦完不成会打击工人的积极性”等。在讨论中，这些落后保守思想受到了批判。目前，矿务局所属各矿正根据本单位具体情况，安排和修订第一季度生产指标。
