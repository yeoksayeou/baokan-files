    According to a communiqué issued by the Soviet and Egyptian sides, in accordance with the agreement between the Soviet government and the government of the Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian government economic delegation headed by Dr. Sidky, Minister of Industry, and the Soviet delegation headed by Belousov, Chairman of the State Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union for Foreign Economic Relations, held talks in Moscow from January 6th to 29th. During the talks, both sides exchanged views broadly and comprehensively on various economic and technical issues of mutual interest. The talks were filled with an atmosphere of sincerity, friendship, cordial concern, and mutual understanding.
    The economic and technical cooperation agreement signed after the talks stipulates that the two governments will strive to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries and develop economic and technical cooperation. They will jointly cooperate to realize Egypt's plans for developing the national economy in geological work, mining industry, oil exploration and oil product production, as well as in metallurgy, machine manufacturing, electrical equipment and chemical industries, light industry, textile industry, food industry, and pharmaceutical industry.
    According to this agreement, Soviet institutions will supply Egypt with machines, equipment, and certain materials, and provide Egypt with technical assistance in designing industrial enterprises and constructing these enterprises through consultation and on-site visits by designers, as well as in assembling machines and equipment, adjusting equipment and putting enterprises into operation, enabling enterprises to reach their designed capacity, and in carrying out geological work and organizing the training of skilled personnel for Egyptian industry.
    The agreement also stipulates that Soviet institutions may invite relevant institutions of various people's democratic countries (if they agree) to carry out design work and provide various equipment, machines, and materials.
    In order to enable Egypt to pay for the design work carried out by Soviet institutions, to pay for the equipment, machines, and materials provided by the Soviet Union to Egypt, and for other services required, the Soviet government will provide the government of the Republic of Egypt with a long-term loan with a term of twelve years and an annual interest rate of 2.55%.
    As remuneration for the equipment, machines, materials, and technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union to Egypt, the Egyptian government will provide the Soviet Union with Egyptian goods, including cotton and other agricultural products, as well as freely convertible foreign exchange.
    Belousov signed the agreement on behalf of the Soviet government, and Sidky signed on behalf of the Egyptian government.
    Khrushchev, Bulganin, Mikoyan, Kosygin and others attended the signing ceremony on the Soviet side.
    Salaama, Deputy Minister of Industry, and Rahman, Secretary-General of the National Planning Committee, attended the signing ceremony on the Egyptian side.
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th — TASS Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government held a reception for the Egyptian government economic delegation in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the 29th.
    Bulganin and Sidky delivered speeches at the reception.
    Bulganin said, we are very aware of the efforts made by the Egyptian people in overcoming the backwardness caused by years of colonial oppression, establishing an independent national economy, and improving their material and cultural living standards. We are also very aware of the serious difficulties that Egypt needs to overcome on this path. We believe that with the support of peace-loving people in all countries, the Egyptian people will succeed in eliminating the consequences of colonialism and consolidating and developing their national economy and culture. In this regard, the Egyptian people can count on the assistance and support of the Soviet Union.
    Bulganin said, we have no doubt that the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed by the Soviet Union and Egypt on the 29th on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit will help to further strengthen the friendship between the people of the two countries, which is in line with the interests of both our countries and the interests of consolidating peace and security in the Near East and the world.
    Sidky said in his reply: Since arriving in the Soviet Union, we have felt everywhere the most friendly attitude and sympathy towards Egypt, the sincere wishes for its independence, and the desire to help it revive. This humanitarian sentiment and the most beautiful wishes for the freedom, peace, and happiness of all peoples, burst out from the bottom of the hearts of the Soviet people, and their government has proven this with practical actions on the international stage. Not only we Egyptians, but all Arabs are deeply convinced of this. The position taken by the Soviet people and the Soviet government towards Egypt at the critical moment of Egypt's survival, at the critical moment when imperialism and evil forces were invading us, and its support for the wishes of freedom-loving people, have made us even more convinced of this. Sidky went on to say that we Arabs are particularly pleased that the Soviet Union not only supports us in achieving freedom, progress, and revival, but also helps us to achieve unity and solidarity.
  When talking about the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Egypt, Sidky said, I think this agreement has given us everything we need to help us complete our industrial development plan. We see that the Soviet Union truly understands our wishes and sincerely helps us realize our hopes. I am deeply convinced that after we have taken this big step, we will make more progress on the road to strengthening cooperation between our two countries in all aspects.

    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联和埃及两国政府的代表29日在莫斯科签订了经济技术合作协定。
    据苏埃双方发表的公报说，根据苏联政府同埃及共和国政府的协议，以工业部长西德基博士为首的埃及政府经济代表团同以苏联部长会议国家对外经济关系委员会主席别尔乌辛为首的苏联代表团在1月6日到29日在莫斯科举行了会谈。在会谈过程中，双方广泛而全面地就彼此感到兴趣的各种经济问题和技术问题交换了意见，会谈充满了真诚友好、亲切关怀和互相谅解的气氛。
    双方在会谈后所签订的经济技术合作协定规定，两国政府力求进一步加强两国间的友好关系和发展两国间的经济和技术合作，将共同合作来实现埃及在地质工作、采矿工业、石油勘探和石油产品的生产，以及冶金、机器制造、电工器材和化学工业、轻工业、纺织工业、食品工业和制药工业等方面的发展国民经济的计划。
    根据这个协定，苏联各机构将供应埃及机器、装备和某些物资，在设计工业企业和建筑这些企业时通过咨询方式和设计者亲临现场的方式给予埃及技术援助，在装配机器和设备、调整装备和使企业开工、使企业达到设计能力方面，在进行地质工作和为埃及工业培养熟练干部的组织工作方面也将给予技术援助。
    协定还规定，苏联各机构可以邀请各人民民主国家的有关机构（如果它们同意的话）进行设计工作，提供各种设备、机器和物资。
    为了使埃及能够支付苏联各机构所进行的设计工作的费用，支付苏联提供给埃及的装备、机器和物资以及其他服务所需的费用，苏联政府向埃及共和国政府提供为期十二年的、年息为2.55％的长期贷款。
    作为对苏联提供给埃及的装备、机器、物资和所给予的技术援助的报酬，埃及政府将向苏联提供埃及商品，其中包括棉花和其他农产品，还有自由外汇。

    埃及方面出席签字仪式的有工业部副部长萨拉马、国家计划委员会秘书长拉赫曼等人。
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府29日在大克里姆林宫为埃及政府经济代表团举行了招待会。
    布尔加宁和西德基在招待会上先后致词。
    布尔加宁说，我们非常了解埃及人民在克服由于多年的殖民主义压迫所造成的落后状态、建立独立的民族经济和提高自己的物质和文化生活水平方面所作的努力。我们也非常了解埃及在这条道路上需要克服的那些严重的困难。我们相信，在各国爱好和平人民的支持下，埃及人民在消除殖民主义后果、巩固和发展民族经济和文化上将会获得成功。在这方面埃及人民可以指望得到苏联的援助和支持。
    布尔加宁说，我们毫不怀疑，苏埃两国29日在完全平等和互利的原则基础上签订的经济和技术合作协定将有助于进一步加强两国人民的友谊，这既符合我们两国的利益，也符合巩固中近东和世界和平和安全的利益。
    西德基致答词说：自从到达苏联以来，我们处处都感到对埃及的最友好的态度和同情，对它的独立的真诚祝愿，以及帮助它复兴的愿望。这种人道主义的情感和对各国人民获得自由、和平和幸福的最美好的祝愿，是从苏联人民心底迸发出来的，而他们的政府在国际舞台上用实际行动证明了这一点。不仅我们埃及人，而且全体阿拉伯人都深信这一点。苏联人民和苏联政府在埃及生死存亡的关头，在帝国主义和邪恶势力对我们进行侵略的关头对埃及所采取的立场，以及它对爱好自由人民的愿望的支持，更使我们深信这一点。西德基接着说，我们阿拉伯人感到特别高兴的是，苏联不仅支持我们取得自由、进步和复兴，并且帮助我们达到统一和团结。
  西德基在谈到苏联和埃及签订的经济和技术合作协定的时候说，我认为，这个协定使我们获得了帮助我们完成发展工业计划所需要的一切东西。我们看到苏联是真正了解我们的愿望和真诚帮助我们实现自己的希望的。我深信，我们迈出了这一大步之后，在加强我们两国各个方面的合作的道路上将会取得更多的进展。
