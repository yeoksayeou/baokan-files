Exhaust All Means to Support Agricultural Production
Zhuzhou Diverts City Sewage to Irrigate Farmland

(Our Dispatch) A report from New Hunan Daily: Zhuzhou City has adopted measures to support agricultural production, including using urban domestic sewage to irrigate farmland and launching a patriotic health campaign to accumulate one million dan of fertilizer.

The method of using domestic sewage to irrigate farmland was first created by factories. In 1956, factories diverted sewage to irrigate 200 mu of farmland to help agricultural cooperatives fight drought. In 1957, they irrigated 400 mu, with a yield of 750 jin per mu, an increase of 150 jin compared to unirrigated land. Moreover, by diverting sewage to the fields, the factory also saved 80,000 jin of bleaching powder needed for sewage treatment.

The Zhuzhou Municipal Party Committee summarized and promoted this factory innovation and is now expanding the use of sewage for farmland irrigation, planning to irrigate 7,000 mu of land this year.

The method of diverting sewage for irrigation involves the sewage flowing through sewage pipes and concentrating in a reservoir. A water pump is used to pump the sewage from the reservoir to a high point, and then it flows into the farmland through prepared channels. To divert Zhuzhou City's sewage to irrigate farmland, some changes are needed to the existing sewage pipelines. A large amount of farmland is on the opposite bank of the Xiang River, so it is also necessary to find a way to get the sewage across the river. Zhuzhou City is now working on changing the sewage pipeline route and is also establishing a pumping station on the riverbank, and preparing to install an inverted siphon pipe under the Xiang River, so that the sewage can be diverted to the opposite bank. Together with the 4,000-meter channel built by agricultural cooperatives and horticultural farms, this will form a sewage irrigation network.

Implementing this method can increase grain production significantly, help maintain the fish fry production area of the Xiang River channel near Zhuzhou, and save the money spent on sewage treatment every year.

This initiative of Zhuzhou City has been supported by the Wuhan Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction and the agricultural and health departments of Hunan Province.

### 想尽各种办法支援农业生产  株洲引城市污水灌溉农田

    想尽各种办法支援农业生产
    株洲引城市污水灌溉农田
    本报讯　新湖南报消息：株洲市采取了利用城市生活污水灌溉农田和结合爱国卫生运动积肥一百万担的措施，支援农业生产。
    利用生活污水灌溉农田的办法是工厂首先创造的。1956年工厂为帮助农业社抗旱，曾引污水灌田二百亩。1957年灌四百亩，亩产七百五十斤，较未灌的增产一百五十斤。而且，由于厂里把污水引到田里去，还节约了处理污水所需的漂白粉八万斤。
    株洲市委总结推广了工厂这个创造，现在正在扩大利用污水灌溉农田，计划在今年灌溉七千亩田。
    引污水灌田的办法是：污水流过污水管道，集中在蓄水池里，用水泵将蓄水池里的污水打到高处，然后顺着开好的渠道灌入农田。要把株洲市的污水引灌农田，目前已经建设的污水管道就需要作一些改变；大量的农田在湘江对岸，还需要设法使污水过江。株洲市现正着手改变污水管道线路，同时在江岸建立一个水泵房，并准备在湘江底下装置一个倒虹吸管，这样就可以把污水引到江对岸。加上农业社和园艺场自行修筑的四千公尺渠道，就形成了一个污水灌溉网。
    实行这个办法，可以增产大量粮食，有利于保养株洲附近的鱼苗产地——湘江河道的鱼苗；同时，也可以省去年年处理污水的钱。
    株洲市这一创举，已经得到了城市建设部武汉给水排水设计院和湖南省农业、卫生等部门的支持。
