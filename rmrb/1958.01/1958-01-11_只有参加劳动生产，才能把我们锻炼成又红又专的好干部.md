    Only by Participating in Labor Production Can We Train Ourselves into Good Cadres Who are Both Red and Expert

    In order to accomplish the great and arduous historical mission, we must resolutely implement the Party's cadre work line and cultivate a cadre team for the Party and the country that strives for the cause of communism, is both Red and expert, and can withstand risks. Our cadre team has developed rapidly. In 1949, there were only more than 10,000 cadres in our province. Now, it has grown to more than 500,000. Many of these cadres have grown up among the working people and have been tempered by wars and land reform struggles, maintaining close ties with the broad masses of working people. They have also made great progress in the past few years under the education of the Party. However, a considerable number of young cadres come from non-working-class backgrounds. They have neither been tempered by actual struggles nor have production knowledge and grassroots work experience. They lack contact with the workers and peasants, are not familiar with how the broad masses of workers and peasants produce and live, do not understand the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and are not clear about how to turn the Party and the state's guidelines and tasks into the actions of the broad masses and into the productive practices of the broad masses. Therefore, they must go to the grassroots level, to the production and labor front, live with the workers and peasants, and be tempered to truly obtain the qualifications of a laborer in order to meet the needs of socialist construction. Because without understanding production and construction, there is no way to guide production and construction. Looking further ahead, in order to build a communist society, ten or twenty years from now, the current young cadres will gradually be promoted to leadership positions. If this group of cadres does not undergo labor training and testing, they will not be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of successors to the cause of socialism and communism. The current international situation is very favorable. The East wind prevails over the West wind, and there may be no opportunity for war training. At the same time, large-scale mass class struggles have also passed. The main opportunity for the younger generation to be tempered is to participate in labor production. Some veteran cadres, although they have participated in labor production and have grassroots work experience during the war, on the one hand, there is a need for lower-level work and a need to strengthen the leadership of grassroots work. On the other hand, these cadres still lack experience in building a new socialist countryside and in grassroots work during the period of peaceful construction. In this way, they cannot act as good commanders in their work, so it is also necessary for them to go down and be tempered.

### 只有参加劳动生产，才能把我们锻炼成又红又专的好干部

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    只有参加劳动生产，才能把我们锻炼成又红又专的好干部
    为了完成伟大而艰巨的历史任务，我们就必须坚决地贯彻执行党的干部工作路线，为党和国家培养一支为共产主义事业奋斗的、又红又专的、经得起风险的干部队伍。我们的干部队伍发展的很快，1949年时我们全省只有一万多个干部，现在已经发展到五十多万干部，这些干部许多是从劳动人民中间生长起来的，经过战争和土改等斗争的锻炼，同广大劳动人民保持着密切的联系，几年来在党的教育下也有很大的进步；但是也有相当一部分青年干部，出身于非劳动阶级，既没有经过实际斗争的锻炼，又没有生产知识和基层工作经验，同工农群众缺乏联系，对广大工农群众怎样生产、怎样生活不大熟悉，对广大工农群众的思想感情不大了解，对怎样把党和国家的方针、任务变成广大群众的行动，变成广大群众的生产实践也不大清楚。因此，必须到基层去，到生产劳动战线上去，同工人、农民一起生活，加以锻炼，真正取得一个劳动者的资格，才能适应社会主义建设事业的需要。因为不懂生产建设，就没有办法去指导生产建设。再从远处看，为了建设共产主义社会，十年、二十年以后，现在的青年干部，将要逐渐被提拔到领导岗位上来，如果这批干部不经过劳动锻炼和考验，他们将无法担负起社会主义和共产主义事业接班人的重担。现在国际形势很有利，东风压倒了西风，战争锻炼的机会可能没有了；同时大规模的群众性的阶级斗争也已经过去，青年一代经受锻炼的主要机会，就是参加劳动生产。有些老干部，虽然参加过劳动生产、有过战争时期的基层工作经验，但是一方面目前下层工作需要，需要加强基层工作的领导，而另一方面这部分干部对于建设社会主义的新农村，对于和平建设时期的基层工作还缺乏经验，这样在工作中，就不能充当一个好的指挥员，所以也有下去锻炼的必要。
