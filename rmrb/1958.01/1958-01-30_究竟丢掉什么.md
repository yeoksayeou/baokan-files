    What Exactly is Being Lost?
    Yi Huai
    When discussing the issue of cadres being sent to lower levels, there's a line of argument that goes like this: labor training can certainly solidify one's stance of serving the people, but after two or three years, one's professional skills become rusty. At that point, even if one has the desire to serve the people, one no longer has the "capital" to do so. Wouldn't that be regrettable! Some comrades who have already gone down for labor training also have similar thoughts.
    Serving the people indeed requires both a firm political stance and specialized professional skills. Without professional skills, merely talking about a political stance will lead to becoming a political empty talker. However, without a firm political stance, even with brilliant professional skills, one is merely a "pragmatist" who has lost their way and cannot truly serve the people well. Didn't many intellectuals shout a few months ago about feeling unappreciated and advocating that scholars should die for those who understand them? The Party's reason for sending cadres to lower levels is precisely to give everyone the opportunity to strengthen and clarify their political stance, which is precisely what many cadres urgently need. The problem arises here. Why don't some comrades feel that they are lacking in this most fundamental aspect, and are not anxious about their shortcomings in these areas, but are only afraid that their professional progress will be somewhat affected? Professional skills can become the ability to serve the people, or they can become the so-called "capital" for pursuing personal fame and gain. Demanding progress in professional skills should be considered a good thing, but if it is divorced from politics, then what is the purpose of delving into professional skills? Isn't it easy for a pragmatist who has lost his way to regard his expertise as capital for pursuing personal fame and gain, and even to be unable to distinguish between friend and foe politically? In the old society, there was a popular saying: "If you learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry, you can go anywhere without fear." Today, whether this argument is still corrupting people to a greater or lesser extent is a matter worthy of attention.
    Will cadres' participation in labor at lower levels really lead to the neglect of professional skills, or even the loss of the ability to serve the people? No, it won't! Although politics cannot replace professional skills, it is the main driving force for professional progress. On today's industrial and cultural and educational fronts, there are many Communist Party members with not very high educational levels, who originally only knew how to fight wars or do rural work. A few years ago, they were complete outsiders, with almost no say in the work they led. At that time, weren't some people waiting to see the Communist Party make a fool of themselves? However, in just a few years, many of these comrades have become true red experts. The reason is obvious: it is not because they are smarter than others, but only because they have a firm and unwavering stance of serving the people wholeheartedly. It is this force that encourages them to overcome difficulties that ordinary people cannot overcome, and to master the work assigned to them by the Party at a speed that ordinary people cannot match. Isn't this a good example for the comrades being sent to lower levels? Although it is impossible to concentrate one's main energy on professional skills during the period of being sent to lower levels as it is in one's work post, one can still take some spare time after labor to review one's professional skills. Especially when these comrades have been trained to have a more full political passion, learning professional skills will be easier, and professional skills will inevitably be trained to be stronger.
    Cadres' participation in labor at lower levels will lead to the loss of some things, but that is not professional skills, but the idea of regarding professional skills as capital for pursuing personal fame and gain, as well as all kinds of other ideological baggage. Why can't this kind of baggage be discarded?!

    究竟丢掉什么
    易槐
    在谈到干部下放问题的时候，有这么一种论调：劳动锻炼固然可以坚定为人民服务的立场，可是两三年后，业务荒疏了，那时候，纵有为人民服务的思想，但已没有了为人民服务的“本钱”，岂不遗憾！已经下去劳动锻炼的同志中，也有类似的想法。
    为人民服务的确是既需要有坚定的政治立场，又需要有专门的业务技能。没有业务技能只讲政治立场，是会变成政治空谈家的。但是，没有坚定的政治立场，纵有高明的业务技能，也只是迷失方向的“实际家”也不可能很好地为人民服务。几个月前不少知识分子不是在那里高喊怀才不遇，主张士为知己者死吗？党所以要让干部下放，正是要使大家能够有机会把政治立场锻炼得更为坚定明确，而这，恰恰正是许多干部所迫切需要的。问题也就发生在这里。为什么有些同志感觉不到自己在这最根本的方面有所欠缺，不为自己这些方面的缺点感到焦虑，而只怕业务的进展多少受到影响呢？业务技能可以成为为人民服务的本领，也可以成为追逐个人名利的所谓“本钱”。要求业务上的进步，应当说是好事情，可是如果脱离了政治，那么，钻研业务的目的究竟是什么呢？迷失了方向的实际家不是很容易把自己的专长当成追求个人名利的资本，甚至在政治上分不清敌我吗？在旧社会有这么一种流行的说法：“学会数理化，走遍天下都不怕。”在今天，这种论调是否还在或多或少的腐蚀人，是很值得注意的问题。
    干部下放参加劳动是不是真会荒疏业务，甚至使人失掉为人民服务的本领呢？不会的！政治虽然不能代替业务，可是政治却是业务进步的主要推动力量。在今天的工业和文教战线上，都有很多文化水平并不很高的原来只会打仗或只会搞农村工作的共产党员，几年前他们还是地地道道的门外汉，对自己所领导的业务几乎没有什么发言权。那时候，有些人不是在等着看共产党的笑话吗？可是，仅仅过了几年，这些同志中有许多已经成了真正的红色专家。道理很明显，并不是因为他们比别人聪明，而仅只是因为他们具有坚定不移的全心全意的为人民服务的立场，正是这种力量鼓舞他们克服了常人所克服不了的困难，以常人所不能及的速度掌握了党所交给他的业务。这不正是下放同志们的好榜样吗？下放期间虽然不可能像在工作岗位上一样把主要精力集中在业务上面，但是在劳动一个时期后还是可以抽出一些工余时间温习业务的，特别是当这些同志锻炼得政治热情更为饱满的时候，学习业务技能也就更加容易，业务本领也必然会锻炼得更强。
    干部下放参加劳动是会丢掉一些东西，但那不是业务技能，而是把业务技能当成追逐个人名利的本钱的以及其他各色各样的思想包袱。这种包袱为什么不能丢掉呢？！
