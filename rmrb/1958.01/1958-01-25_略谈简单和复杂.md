    A Brief Discussion on Simplicity and Complexity
    Ruo Shui
    In his essay "Simplicity and Complexity" (see page 8 of the People's Daily, March 15, 1957), Xu Maoyong introduced two lines of thought to the readers: "First, when encountering simple things, see them as more complex; second, when encountering complex problems, simplify them."
    He also gave the following examples: An old cadre with "low cultural level" talked to him about poetry, starting with the question "What is poetry?" and raised many questions in succession, resulting in more and more complexity and "discovering many problems." Also: Marx studied commodities, "examining and researching, exploring many principles, so complex that we... become dizzy." These are all "turning simplicity into complexity." As for "turning complexity into simplicity," there are also examples, such as making summaries at meetings.
    Xu Maoyong also "instructed" his lackeys in his small clique in this way: one of the secrets of his writing essays is to "transform the simple into the complex, and the complex into the simple."
    Therefore, this issue is worth investigating.
    Indeed, many seemingly simple things become complex after in-depth research. Then, can we take "turning simplicity into complexity" as a line of thought like Xu Maoyong? This needs to be analyzed. The problem is that Xu Maoyong did not clearly distinguish between things and the process of understanding them. Take poetry and commodities as examples. From a certain perspective, these two things are indeed becoming more and more complex as they are studied, but it is not people's research that makes them complex; they were not so simple in the first place. People's initial understanding of them is very simple, but they themselves are not that simple. What is poetry? What is a commodity? If we say: "Poetry is just writing in lines," "Commodities are things that can be bought and sold," these are just extremely poor and superficial concepts; they do not grasp the essence of poetry and commodities. In subsequent research, people gradually found out the various characteristics of poetry and commodities, and the internal connections of poetry and commodities with other things. Only then did their concepts of poetry and commodities gradually become comprehensive, rich, and profound, and only then did they realize that poetry and commodities each have their own essence, the essence of poetry determines that poetry takes the form of lines, and the essence of commodities determines their trading relationship. Objective things themselves are concrete, with many aspects and many connections. Marx said, "The concrete is concrete because it is the sum of many stipulations, hence unity in diversity." People's concepts of concrete objective objects are always relatively simple at first, and later this concept gradually becomes richer and reflects the essence of the object. In the terms of dialectics, this is the process of rising from abstract concepts to concrete concepts. From the formal aspect, this is also the process of "from simple to complex." Marx emphasized that this is not the process of the genesis of the concrete thing itself, and Hegel's absurdity lies in equating these two processes. (See "Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy")
    In people's understanding, the process of "turning complexity into simplicity" is also often carried out. Generally speaking, people's understanding is always much simpler than the object it reflects, because people's understanding cannot exhaust all the content of the objective object. From rich sensory materials to the formation of preliminary concepts, from the formal point of view, is also a process of "turning complexity into simplicity." But if we think that the purpose of understanding is only to turn complexity into simplicity, then we are very wrong. Mach grasped this point and put forward the so-called "principle of economy of thought." In fact, our purpose is to understand the essence and laws of objective things, not to save trouble, not to simplify thinking.
    From the formal point of view, scientific generalization is indeed expressed as turning complexity into simplicity, but if we depart from the principle of seeking truth from facts and put forward "turning complexity into simplicity" in isolation, the result will not be scientific generalization but the "oversimplification" of problems as commonly said. Scientific generalization is derived from comprehensive analysis, while unscientific simplification replaces the whole with the partial, abandoning the essence and interconnections of things, and observing problems only from the surface.
    Roughly speaking, people's understanding goes from sensation to concept, from complex to simple, and from abstract concept to concrete concept, from simple to complex. But generally speaking, human understanding is constantly going from unknown to known, from partial knowledge to more aspects of knowledge, so the overall process is still from simple to complex, and from complex to simple is only a local manifestation of this overall process. Whether it is from simple to complex, or from complex to simple, it should be a process that reflects the objective. Simply putting forward a principle of "turning simplicity into complexity, turning complexity into simplicity" without combining it with the process of understanding and giving specific explanations is itself a kind of simplification.
    Xu Maoyong himself seems to vaguely feel that this statement has the danger of being criticized, so he added a "proviso" saying: not all ways of "turning simplicity into complexity, turning complexity into simplicity" are correct. However, he did not say what the specific criteria are for being correct, but only quoted the examples criticized by Hegel to tell readers to beware of falling into "abstract thinking."
    However, Xu Maoyong seems not to know that this Hegel himself made a big mistake on this issue. He simplified the complex objective things to a very simple extent, not worth mentioning; while he made the simple abstract concepts mysterious and extremely complex. Therefore, Marx criticized him in "Hegel's Philosophy of Law": "Here, the simplest thing is described as the most complex thing, and the most complex thing is described as the simplest thing." Obviously, Hegel is very good at "turning simplicity into complexity, turning complexity into simplicity," but Hegel used this method upside down on the basis of idealism, and Xu Maoyong just obliterates this point.
    Materialism, as Engels said, is to understand the original appearance of the world as it is, without any additions. Although there is a process from simple to complex and from complex to simple in understanding, the result is always required to conform to the objective. Things that are originally simple should be returned to simplicity; things that are originally complex should be returned to complexity. Idealism, on the one hand, adds some things to the objective world that it does not have, such as gods, reason, the cosmic spirit, etc., which complicates the world; on the other hand, they deny material entities, deny objective laws, etc., which simplifies the world.
    Xu Maoyong is also like this. His essay never explained the issue of "simplicity and complexity" from the perspective of truthfully reflecting the objective, which is in line with his own true thoughts. For him, "turning simplicity into complexity" and "turning complexity into simplicity" are just a technique that can be arbitrarily manipulated. Xu Maoyong was punished by the Party for making serious mistakes in the past. This was originally a simple problem, but in Xu Maoyong's mind, it became complicated and turned into a series of problems such as "bureaucratism" and "sectarianism," and he wrote many essays to vent his dissatisfaction and attack the Party with many vicious words. (Even when citing Hegel in the essay "Simplicity and Complexity," he was alluding to something.) On the other hand, the complex issue of being anti-Party and anti-socialist was simplified by Xu Maoyong, in order to cover it up, as simply being dissatisfied with someone or something. The same is true for the issue of essays. Dissatisfaction with essays is partly due to certain bureaucrats and dogmatists who do not like correct satire, and partly due to certain essay writers themselves who did not write from the correct standpoint. However, this issue, under Xu Maoyong's pen, was simplified in the first step, becoming simply a problem of external constraints and blows, and then complicated in the second step, adding branches and leaves, adding fuel to the fire, so the essay is facing a "crisis of extinction." In short, whether it is "turning complexity into simplicity" or "turning simplicity into complexity," the purpose is not to better reflect reality at all, but is determined by one's own subjective needs! This is the true face of Xu Maoyong, the so-called "Marxist."

    略谈简单和复杂
    若水
    徐懋庸在“简单与复杂”（见人民日报1957年3月15日八版）这篇杂文里，向读者介绍了两条思想方法：“第一条，碰到简单的事情，把它看得复杂些；第二条，碰到复杂的问题，把它弄得简单些。”
    他还举了这样的例子：有一位“文化水平很低”的老干部同他谈诗，从“诗是什么”问起，一连提出了好多问题，结果是越谈越复杂，“发现了很多问题”。还有：马克思研究商品，“考察来，考察去，研究出许多道理，复杂得使我们……头昏眼花”。这都是“化简单为复杂”。至于“化复杂为简单”呢，也有例子的，比如开会做总结。
    徐懋庸在给他的小集团里的喽囉的信里，也这样“教导”说：他写杂文的秘诀之一，就是“化简为复，化复为简”。
    因此，这个问题值得考察一下。
    的确，有许多看来很简单的事物，经过深入的研究，就变得复杂起来了。那末，是不是可以像徐懋庸那样把“化简单为复杂”作为一条思想方法呢？这是要加以分析的。问题在于：徐懋庸没有把事物和对于这一事物的认识过程明确地区别开来。就拿诗和商品作例吧。从某一方面看来，这两件事物固然是越研究越复杂，可是这并不是人们的研究使得它们变复杂起来的，它们原来就不是那么简单的事物。人们在开始对它们的认识是很简单的，可是它们本身并不那样简单。什么是诗？什么是商品？如果说：“诗就是分行的文字”，“商品就是可以买卖的东西”，这只是极贫乏极肤浅的概念，它们并没有抓住诗和商品的本质。在往后的研究中，人们逐渐找出了诗和商品的各种特性，诗和商品同其他事物的内部联系，于是他们对于诗和商品的概念才逐步全面起来，丰富起来，深刻起来，才认识诗和商品各有其本质，诗的本质决定诗采取分行的形式，商品的本质决定它的买卖关系。客观事物本身都是具体的，具有许多方面和许多联系。马克思说，“具体之所以为具体，因为它是许多规定的总结，因而是复杂物的统一。”人们对于客观的具体对象的概念，起初总是比较简单的，以后这个概念才逐步丰富起来，并反映了对象的本质。用辩证法的术语来说，这就是由抽象概念上升到具体概念的过程。从形式方面看，这也就是“由简单到复杂”的过程。马克思强调指出，这并不就是具体事物本身的产生过程，而黑格尔的荒谬就在把这两个过程等同起来。（见“政治经济学批判导言”）
    在人的认识里，也经常进行着“化复杂为简单”的过程。一般的说，人的认识比起它所反映的对象来，总是简单得多，因为人的认识不可能穷竭客观对象的全部内容。从丰富的感觉材料到形成初步的概念，从形式上看，也是一个“化复杂为简单”的过程。但是如果以为认识的目的只在化复杂为简单，那就大错特错了。马赫就是抓住这一点而提出所谓“思惟经济原理”。其实我们的目的是认识客观事物的本质和规律，而不是图省事，不是为了简化思惟。
    从形式上说，科学的概括固然表现为化复杂为简单，但如果离开实事求是的原则，孤立地提出“化复杂为简单”，那结果就不会是科学的概括而是普通所说的看问题的“简单化”了。科学的概括是从全面的分析得出的，而非科学的简单化是用片面代替全体，抛开事物的本质和相互联系，仅仅从表面上观察问题。
    粗略地说，人的认识从感觉到概念，是从复杂到简单，从抽象概念到具体概念，又是从简单到复杂。但是总的说来，人类的认识是不断地由不知到知，由片面的知到更多方面的知，因此总的过程还是由简单到复杂，而由复杂到简单不过是这个总的过程的局部表现。不论从简单到复杂也罢，从复杂到简单也罢，都应该是一个反映客观的过程。单单提出一条“化简单为复杂，化复杂为简单”的原则来，不结合认识的过程而予以具体的说明，这本身就是一种简单化的提法。
    徐懋庸自己似乎也模糊地感到这种提法有受批评的危险，所以他加了一条“但书”说：并不是一切“化简单为复杂，化复杂为简单”的办法都是对头的。不过怎样才对头，他又并没有说出具体的标准来，只是引用了黑格尔所批评过的例子，告诉读者要提防陷入“抽象的思惟”。
    不过徐懋庸看来是不知道，这个黑格尔本人正是在这个问题上犯了大错误，复杂的客观事物被他弄得简单非常，不值一顾；而简单的抽象概念却被他搞得神秘莫测，复杂万分。所以马克思在“黑格尔法哲学”里批评他说：“在这里，最简单的东西被描绘成最复杂的东西，而最复杂的东西又被描绘成最简单的东西。”显然，黑格尔是很善于“化简单为复杂，化复杂为简单”的，只是黑格尔是在唯心论的基础上颠倒地运用这个方法的，而徐懋庸恰恰抹煞了这一点。
    唯物主义，正如恩格斯所说，是对世界的本来面貌作如实的了解，不作任何附加。尽管在认识里有由简单到复杂和由复杂到简单的过程，但那结果总是要求符合客观的。本来是简单的事物，还它一个简单；本来是复杂的事物，还它一个复杂。唯心主义，一方面是给客观世界加上了一些它本来没有的东西，如什么神呀，理性呀，宇宙精神呀，等等，这一方面是把世界复杂化了；另一方面他们又否认物质实体，否认客观规律，等等，这一方面他们又把世界简单化了。
    徐懋庸也正是这样。他的这篇杂文始终没有从如实地反映客观来说明“简单和复杂”的问题，这是符合于他自己的真实思想的。对于他来说，“化简单为复杂”和“化复杂为简单”不过是一条可以任意玩弄的手法。徐懋庸过去由于犯了严重的错误而受到党的处分，这本来是一个简单的问题，到了徐懋庸的思想里，却复杂化起来，变成了“官僚主义”“宗派主义”等等一系列的问题，写了许多篇杂文来发泄他的不满，用许多恶毒的词句来攻击党。（就连在“简单与复杂”这篇文章中援引黑格尔时，他也是暗有所指的。）另一方面，明明是反党反社会主义的复杂问题，徐懋庸为了掩饰的原故，又简单化为只是对某人某事不满。关于小品文的问题也是这样。小品文引起不满，有的责任是在于某些官僚主义者和教条主义者，他们对于正确的讽刺也不喜欢，有的责任是在于某些小品文作者本身，他们没有站在正确的立场上来写作。可是这个问题在徐懋庸笔下，第一步是简单化，变成了仅仅是外力束缚和打击的问题，第二步是再加以复杂化，添枝生叶，添油加酱，于是小品文就面临着“消亡的危机”了。总之，“化复杂为简单”也罢，“化简单为复杂”也罢，那目的，根本不是更好地反映现实，而是决定于自己主观上的需要！这就是所谓“马克思主义者”的徐懋庸的真正面目。
