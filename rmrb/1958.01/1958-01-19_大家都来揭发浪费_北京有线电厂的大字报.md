    Everyone Exposes Waste
    Big Character Posters from the Beijing Wire Factory
      Excessive Stockpiling is Waste
    Under the guidance of the factory leadership's thought of "rather buy more, to be prepared for the unexpected," they successively purchased large quantities of high-quality steel plates, soft aluminum plates, plexiglass, insulating tape, and other valuable materials, sixteen kinds in total, in the past two years. For example, thirty tons of steel plates were purchased, worth nearly 100,000 yuan. What is the use of buying these things?
    Since the establishment of the factory, these production materials or auxiliary materials have never been used; as it stands now, it seems that our factory doesn't even have the possibility of using them as substitutes. We ask, if the materials our factory needs cannot be purchased, and other factories buy them and leave them unused, what should we say? If everyone practices "rather buy more, to be prepared for the unexpected," what is the point of planned production? Especially at present, when the country is short of raw materials, excessive stockpiling is waste.

          Two Suggestions
    I. Overcome the phenomenon of waste in the use of materials. Our factory wastes a lot of materials. For example, the steel pipes used to make testing instruments are five meters long when purchased, but we only use three meters, wasting 40%. The state cannot produce according to our needs, so we must find ways to avoid this waste. To this end, I suggest that the General Design Section, the General Technology Section, and the Technical Supervision Section quickly study the rational use of these materials.
    II. Some workshops, especially the workers in Workshops No. 2 and No. 4, like to dump waste from the windows, causing copper shavings and iron filings to mix together. Copper shavings are worth one or two yuan per kilogram, while iron filings are only worth one jiao per kilogram. Mixing them together will reduce the factory's income. More importantly, copper shavings mixed into iron filings will affect the quality of copper smelting. I hope the workers pay attention when dumping waste.

    For Whom Do the Lights Shine Brightly?
    The waste of electricity in our factory is very serious. We conducted an inspection and found that even two hours after work, many workshops, living quarters, and toilets were brightly lit, especially Workshops No. 2 and No. 5. Workshop No. 2 had 53 lights on, the living quarters had 6 lights on, and the toilets had 4 lights on. Workshop No. 5 had 45 lights on, and the living quarters had 4 lights on. The lights used in the workshops are 150 watts each, and the lights used in the living quarters and toilets are 40 watts each. Comrades, please calculate how much electricity is wasted! Waste of electricity not only directly affects the cost of our factory's products, but also increases the tension of the city's power supply.
    I hope that the workshop leaders will designate someone to manage electricity use; and mobilize all comrades to turn off the lights when leaving work, and to minimize the use of general lighting.

    Please Look at the Waste in Workshop No. 6
    Please look at the waste in Workshop No. 6: Two nickel plating tanks are left unused; 198 kilograms of nickel sulfate, 36 kilograms of magnesium sulfate, 60 kilograms of sodium sulfate, 24 kilograms of boric acid, 6 kilograms of sodium cyanide, and a large tank of copper cyanide plating solution—these chemicals, worth several thousand yuan, are left idle in the ventilation room. If they are not used, why were they claimed? Furthermore, disregarding actual needs, a chromium plating tank was blindly made, which was too large to use. It was only usable after the rubber lining was changed, wasting more than 1,000 yuan. The degreasing tank didn't need rubber lining but was lined with rubber, these few items alone wasted more than 10,000 yuan of state funds. Are these things just going to be wasted like this? Please leaders consider an inspection.
                  (Chen Kuan, Workshop No. 6)
    Why Claim So Much?
    Phenolic varnish was purchased from Shanghai. Each bucket weighs eighteen jin and is worth more than ninety yuan. Workshops No. 16 and No. 19 each claimed two buckets, almost all of which was wasted. After Workshop No. 16 claimed the varnish on September 2nd of last year, they used a little bit, but didn't seal the bucket after use, and just threw it outside the door. When they wanted to use it at the end of the year, they found that the varnish had deteriorated and could not be used. I ask, why claim so much?

    大家都来揭发浪费
    北京有线电厂的大字报
      大量积压就是浪费
    厂领导在“宁愿多买，以防万一”的思想指导下，前年和去年陆续买了大量的优质钢板、软铝板、有机玻璃、绝缘带等十六种贵重的器材。比如钢板就买了三十吨，价值近十万元。这些东西买来有什么用？
    从建厂以来，生产材料或辅助材料都没有用过；现在看，我厂连代用的可能都没有。试问，如果我厂需要的材料买不到，而别的厂买去又放着不用，我们该怎么说呢？假如大家都来个“宁愿多买，以防万一”，还叫什么计划生产呢？特别是在目前，国家原材料缺乏的时候，大量积压就是浪费。
                  （原材料检验组）
          两点建议
    一、克服材料使用上的浪费现象。我厂在材料使用上的浪费很大，比如制测试仪器用的钢管，进货时每根长五公尺，我们只用了三公尺，浪费了40％。国家不能按照我们的需要生产，我们必须设法避免这方面的浪费。为此，我建议总设计科、总工艺科和技术监督科迅速研究这些材料的合理使用问题。
    二、有些车间，尤其是二号车间、四号车间的工人同志，爱从窗口往外倒废料，使得铜屑和铁屑混起来了。铜屑每公斤价值一两元，铁屑每公斤仅值一角。混了起来会减少工厂的收入。更重要的，铁屑里混入铜屑，会影响炼铜的质量，希望工人同志注意倒废料。

    灯火辉煌为的谁？
    我厂浪费电的情况很严重。我们作了一次检查，检查的时候已是下班两个多钟头了，但好些车间、生活间、厕所都灯火辉煌，尤其是二号车间、五号车间最为严重。二号车间开着五十三只灯，生活间开着六只灯，厕所开着四只灯。五号车间开着四十五只灯，生活间开着四只灯。车间用的灯每只一百五十瓦，生活间和厕所用的灯每只四十瓦。请同志们算算，这浪费了多少电啊！浪费电力不但直接影响我厂产品成本，也加重了全市供电的紧张。
    希望车间领导指定专人管理用电；并发动全体同志下班时随手关灯，尽量少开一般照明用灯。
          （机械动力科青年监督岗）
    请看六号车间的浪费
    请看六号车间的浪费：两个镀镍槽摆着不用；硫酸镍一百九十八公斤、硫酸镁三十六公斤、硫酸钠六十公斤、硼酸二十四公斤、氰化纳六公斤、以及氰化镀铜溶液一大槽子，这些价值几千元的药品，都闲放在通风间里。既然搁着不用，为什么又要领呢？还有，不顾实际需要，盲目地做了一个镀铬槽，大了不好用，换过胶板才算用上了，浪费了一千多元；去油槽本来不需要胶板而用了胶板，单是上边这几项，就浪费了国家资金一万多元。难道这些东西就这样浪费了吗？请领导考虑检查。
                  （六号车间陈宽）
    为什么要领那么多？
    酚醛清漆，是从上海买来的。每桶重十八斤，值九十余元，十六号车间、十九号车间各领了两桶，差不多全给浪费了。去年9月2日十六号车间把漆领来后，用了一点点，用过后没把桶封上，就随便扔在门外，到年底想用时才去找，结果漆变质不能用了。请问，为什么要领那么多？
