Science popularization work must also have a Great Leap Forward!
The Science Popularization Association plans future work.

(Our dispatch) The work of popularizing science and technology can also have a Great Leap Forward. This was affirmed by the National Science and Technology Popularization Work Planning Conference held by the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization in Beijing starting from the 13th. The meeting pointed out that in the future, science popularization organizations at all levels should carry out science and technology popularization work in rural areas, continue to strengthen science and technology popularization work among workers and cadres, and strive for the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the new high tide in industry, and the historical task of cultivating intellectuals from the working class!

At the beginning of the meeting, the representatives launched a fierce debate on the question of "can science popularization work have a Great Leap Forward?" Some people felt that "science popularization work is amateur work; it is okay to do more or less, and it is not a mistake not to do it." Many people mentioned that "they don't have enough enthusiasm for science popularization work, like women with bound feet, always swaying and shaking, and never thought that science popularization work also needs a Great Leap Forward." Measures such as presenting facts, comparing the past, comparing conditions, and finding reasons were adopted to seriously criticize conservative thinking. The facts presented by the representatives proved that one of the problems in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production was that scientific and technological guidance did not keep up. Representatives from Anhui, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other places reported that farmers have great enthusiasm for learning scientific and technological knowledge. At the same time, after the emergence of new production upsurges in industrial and mining enterprises in various places, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff to learn scientific and technological knowledge is getting higher and higher. After the debate, the representatives unanimously agreed that science and technology popularization work must adapt to the new situation and greatly develop.

In order to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the meeting required that the more than 1,300 counties and cities across the country that have established branch associations should achieve "establishing organizations in every township and carrying out work in every commune" within one to two years. Counties and cities that have not yet established branch associations should strive to establish branch associations within the year in accordance with the spirit of active promotion, and gradually carry out rural work. In terms of industrial enterprises, it is required that large and medium-sized factories and mines have association organizations within one to two years, and small factories and mines also have association work. In counties and cities that have already established branch associations, the number of beneficiaries of science popularization propaganda in 1958 will reach one-quarter to one-half of the local population.

The meeting required all levels of association organizations to vigorously hold lectures on agricultural technical knowledge for cadres going to the countryside, absorb cadres going to the countryside to participate in science and technology popularization work, and cooperate closely with agricultural cooperative administrations and the Communist Youth League, using agricultural technical night schools, rural clubs, and people's schools as positions, and in accordance with the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), vigorously promote scientific and technical knowledge such as water conservancy construction, fertilizers, agricultural tools, pesticides, cultivation techniques, soil improvement, and eliminating the four pests; cooperate closely with factory administrations, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to do a good job in spare-time technical education, actively promote advanced experience, and carry out general science knowledge promotion; work in the military, ethnic minorities, and other areas should also be strengthened.

    科学普及工作也必须大跃进
    科普协会规划今后工作
    本报讯  科学技术普及工作也能够大跃进。这是中华全国科学技术普及协会从13日起在北京举行的全国科学技术普及工作规划会议肯定的。会议指出，今后各级科普组织应该开展农村科学技术普及工作，继续加强职工和干部的科学技术普及工作，为农业的大跃进，为工业的新高涨，为培养工人阶级知识分子的历史任务而奋斗！
    会议开始，代表们就“科普工作能不能大跃进”的问题展开了激烈的辩论。有些人觉得“科普工作是业余工作，多搞也行，少搞也行，不搞也不犯错误”。有不少人谈到，“自己对科普工作劲头不足，像小脚女人一样，总是东摇西摆，没想到科普工作也要大跃进”。采取摆事实、比过去、比条件、找原因等办法，严肃地批判了保守思想。代表们提出来的事实证明，农业生产大跃进中出现的问题之一就是科学技术指导没跟上去。安徽、浙江、山西、陕西等地的代表们反映，农民学习科学技术知识的劲头很大。同时，各地工矿企业中新的生产高潮出现以后，广大职工群众要求学习科学技术知识的热情愈来愈高涨起来。经过辩论，代表们一致认为科学技术普及工作，必须适应新的形势大发展。
    为了适应农业生产大跃进的形势，会议要求全国已经建立支会的一千三百多个县市，应该在一、两年内作到“乡乡建立组织，社社开展工作”；还没有建立支会的县、市根据积极促进的精神，年内要争取建立支会，并逐步开展农村工作。在工业企业方面，要求一、两年内做到大、中型厂矿都有协会组织，小厂矿也都有协会工作。在已经建立支会的县市，1958年科普宣传的受益人次达到当地人口总数的四分之一到一半以上。
    会议要求协会各级组织，大力为下乡干部举办农业技术知识讲座，吸收下乡干部参加科学技术普及工作，和农业社行政、共青团密切合作，以农业技术夜校、农村俱乐部、民校为阵地，按照全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）精神，大力宣传兴修水利、肥料、农具、农药、耕作技术、改良土壤、除四害等科学技术知识；同工厂行政、工会、共青团密切合作，办好业余技术教育，积极推广先进经验并开展一般科学知识宣传；部队、少数民族等方面工作也要增强。
