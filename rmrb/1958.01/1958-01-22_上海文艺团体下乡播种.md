    The fifty-two comrades drawn from the Shanghai Chorus, Shanghai Experimental Opera House, Shanghai Song and Dance Troupe, Shanghai National Orchestra, Shanghai Wind Orchestra, and other literary and art organizations in Shanghai to participate in the guidance of mass cultural activities in rural areas have already gone to the countryside to begin their work.

    Among the fifty-two people are professional talents in various aspects such as creation, singing, directing, musical accompaniment, and stage art. Among them, thirty people have gone to the Western Suburbs, twelve to the Eastern Suburbs, and ten to the Northern Suburbs. They will go deep into the agricultural producers' cooperatives and production teams to study how mass cultural activities can serve agricultural production, and how to carry out mass cultural work during the busy farming season. At the same time, they will create singing materials with the themes of model deeds and heroic figures emerging in production, personally perform them, vigorously organize mass singing and creation activities, and scout and cultivate literary and artistic backbone elements in rural areas.

    上海文艺团体下乡播种
    上海合唱团、上海实验歌剧院、上海歌舞团、上海民族乐团、上海管乐团等文艺团体抽调出的参加农村群众文艺活动辅导工作的五十二位同志，已经下乡开始工作。
    五十二人中，有创作、演唱、导演、音乐伴奏、舞台美术等各方面的专业人材，其中到西郊区的有三十人，东郊区的十二人，北郊区的十人。他们将深入各农业社生产队，研究群众文艺活动怎样为农业生产服务，以及在农忙的时候怎样展开群众文艺工作。同时他们将创作以生产中涌现出来的模范事迹、英雄人物为主题的演唱材料，亲自进行演唱，大力组织群众的演唱和创作活动，物色和培养农村中的文艺骨干分子。
