Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The broad masses of workers and staff in Beijing's factories, mines, construction, transportation, and financial and trade systems are successively raising the torch of anti-waste, fiercely burning all kinds of wasteful phenomena. This is a new high tide in rectification.

Large scale, fierce momentum, high mass enthusiasm, and close integration with the high tide of production are the prominent characteristics of this anti-waste movement. In many advanced units, the following situation has emerged: on the one hand, the broad masses are conducting merciless exposure, and on the other hand, leading cadres are joining the masses in calculating big accounts, comparing with advanced units, and raising key issues. Some units with slower actions are also working hard to catch up.

Having undergone the tempering of the rectification movement, the workers and staff of state-owned large-scale factories and mines launched a fierce offensive against all kinds of wasteful phenomena with great fanfare from the beginning of the movement. In many factories and mines, the use and maintenance of tools and equipment, the quality of products, the "waste products" that are scrapped, the materials that have been stockpiled in warehouses for years or decades and cannot be used up, and the unreasonable work quotas have all become the main objects of people's inspection, cleanup, or exposure. Workers and staff of the North China Radio Equipment Factory revealed that the spare parts, electrical appliances, and insulation materials stockpiled in the factory's thermal power station filled three entire warehouses, including nine tons of seamless steel pipes, three tons of glass fiber, and more than 29,000 firebricks, all of which are in short supply on the market, with a total value of more than one million yuan, and some materials will not be used up in six or seven years. They demanded that the leadership deal with this batch of stockpiled materials as soon as possible with revolutionary spirit. Workers and staff of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory criticized the factory for its lax inspection, which resulted in a loss of more than 340,000 yuan due to waste products alone in 1957. Some workers in the First Automobile Accessories Factory pointed out that they have exceeded the prescribed work quotas by six times in actual operation and criticized the factory leadership for not revising them until now. Leading cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant compared the advanced indicators of Anshan Iron and Steel in several major aspects, such as the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, the amount of coke consumed in ironmaking, the quota for ore consumption, and equipment accidents, and found that if they could catch up in these aspects, they could increase profits by several million yuan a year. While exposing waste, workers and staff in many units are actively thinking of ways to plug the loopholes of waste.

The workers and staff of local industries who have just formulated this year's Great Leap Forward plan are advancing victoriously, pursuing waste. Some factories have already established several specialized groups according to the nature of the problems, rectifying while opposing; some factories are holding special meetings of technology, material supply, finance, and veteran workers to further expose waste phenomena. A large number of facts revealed by the workers and staff of various factories show that the chaotic enterprise management and backward production technology of Beijing's local industries are the fundamental causes of waste. Workers and staff of the Beijing Metal Structure Factory revealed that due to poor management, the factory wasted 60,000 workdays last year. In one workshop of the Beijing Glass Factory, the loss of waste products alone amounted to 250,000 yuan in one year. Workers and staff of this factory pointed out that opposing poor product quality and changing backward technology are the main key issues in the factory's anti-waste campaign, and they demanded that the leadership quickly study and improve them. In the anti-waste movement, many factories have sent people to advanced units to learn while mobilizing the masses to expose. Workers and staff of the Qinghe Woolen Mill revealed that the factory has a high re-dyeing rate and uses a lot of materials, costing 4.5 yuan to dye one meter of serge, while Shanghai State-owned No. 3 Woolen Mill only needs a little more than 2 yuan. Now, the factory has sent a group of people to Shanghai to learn. The competent departments of Beijing's local industries are preparing to organize comparisons among all similar factories in the city and with advanced factories in other places.

In the construction sector, nearly 20,000 construction workers are conducting winter training with anti-waste as the central topic; in addition, more than 30,000 workers are fighting against the severe cold at construction sites during the day and firing at waste phenomena at night. At the beginning, construction workers in some units conducted self-examination with a sense of ownership. In order to better mobilize the masses, the leadership immediately called on everyone to first point the spearhead of anti-waste at the leadership and management. Feng Guicheng, deputy director of technology at the Telegraph Building construction site, also examined the incident on big-character posters that caused a loss of more than 8,000 yuan due to his ineffective leadership. This method of the leadership showing its determination to "ignite themselves" with action further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to expose waste. What is now being exposed by the construction workers is mainly the two key issues of poor engineering quality and excessively high engineering costs, which cause serious waste in capital construction. They revealed on big-character posters that when building the state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, the experience of using white ash slag to level the floor was promoted without good prior testing, resulting in the rework of more than 4,000 square meters of floor, wasting more than 3,000 yuan of state funds. Many construction sites have not adhered to the three regulations of no contract, no budget, and no construction organization design, resulting in wasteful phenomena such as blind material preparation and improper labor allocation during construction, which are being exposed one after another.

The workers and staff of the financial and trade system launched an offensive against serious wasteful phenomena such as poor management, huge circulation expenses, and large losses of commodities. In the six or seven days after the start of the movement, workers and staff revealed many shocking wasteful phenomena in the financial and trade system. In the past year, the Beijing Food Company lost more than 10 million yuan due to overestimating the weight of live commodities (such as live pigs) and poor breeding, resulting in weight loss and deaths. The Vegetable Company caused a backlog due to blindly purchasing goods, resulting in the complete rotting and deterioration of 300,000 kilograms of tomatoes and 140,000 kilograms of wax gourds in August and September last year. More than 200,000 kilograms of spring oranges supplied by the dried fruit business department during the Spring Festival last year were moldy due to poor storage. The workers and staff of these units posted big-character posters saying, "It hurts us to see good things rot!" Now the anti-waste movement in the commercial system is becoming more and more intense. At the same time, various units have begun to study the management and operation of advanced enterprises and carry out activities such as comparing cost levels, comparing losses, and comparing measures.

Before the start of this movement, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened responsible party cadres from these departments to discuss the current key tasks in the rectification movement. According to the general rectification of these units has ended, the work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to lower levels has been mostly completed, the production upsurge has appeared, and the workers and staff have made a large number of exposures of serious wasteful phenomena in their enterprises, it was decided to directly guide the socialist debate that has been launched and is being prepared to issues related to promoting production leaps, and immediately allocate a period of time to concentrate efforts to carry out a mass anti-waste movement. At the same time, combined with the actual situation of each unit, carry out the struggle against conservative ideas and improve the quality of products, projects, or services. In this struggle, first mobilize all workers and staff to boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly fully expose all aspects of waste. The purpose of exposing waste is not to pursue responsibility, but to summarize experiences and lessons, get rid of waste, boost morale, and promote the Great Leap Forward in production and operation. At the same time, it is also necessary to launch a major comparison between the same units, comparing output, quality, cost, variety, and business management, and demanding oneself with the highest standards that can be achieved. The great debate starts from these issues. Under the guidance of the above spirit, when mobilizing the masses, factories, mines, construction, transportation, and financial and trade systems have first explained the international and domestic revolutionary situation and tasks to all workers and staff, and clarified the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and building the country with diligence and thrift, so that the broad masses of workers and staff not only economically but also politically understand the significance of the anti-waste movement.

    领导干部同群众一起算大账比先进提出关键问题
    北京向各种浪费展开猛攻
    目的是：总结经验教训，改掉浪费，鼓足干劲，推动生产、经营大跃进
    据新华社22日讯　北京市各厂矿、建筑、交通运输和财贸系统的广大职工群众，正陆续举起反浪费的火把，猛烧各种浪费现象。这是整改中又一个新的高潮。
    规模大，来势猛，群众热情高，紧紧结合生产高潮，是这次反浪费运动的一个显著的特点。许多先进单位都出现了这种情景：一方面广大群众进行无情的揭发，另一方面领导干部同群众一起算大账，比先进，提出关键问题。有些动作比较迟缓的单位，也正在努力赶上。
    经历过整风锻炼的国营大型厂矿企业的职工，在运动一开始时，就有声有色地向各种浪费现象展开了猛烈的攻势。在许多厂矿企业里，从工具设备的使用、维修情况，产品的质量、被报废的“废品”、积压在仓库的几年几十年都用不了的物资，到不合理的工时定额，都成了人们检查、清理或揭发的主要对象。华北无线电器材厂的职工揭发出厂内热电站积压的备件、电器和保温材料就堆满了整整三大间仓库，其中包括现在市场上缺少的无缝钢管九吨、玻璃丝三吨、耐火砖二万九千多块，价值共一百多万元，有些物资六、七年也用不完。他们要求领导上用革命精神从速处理这批被积压的物资。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的职工，批评工厂检验不严，以致在1957年内光废品一项就造成了三十四万多元的损失。第一汽车附件厂有些工人提出自己在实际操作中已超过规定的工时定额六倍，批评工厂的领导上到现在还不作修改。石景山钢铁厂领导干部在高炉的利用系数、炼铁耗用的焦炭数量、矿石消耗定额以及设备事故等几个主要方面，和鞍钢的先进指标作比较，发现如能在这些方面赶上去，一年就可增加数百万元的利润。在揭发浪费的同时，许多单位的职工并积极想办法堵塞浪费的漏洞。
    刚刚订出今年大跃进计划的地方工业职工们，正乘胜前进，追击浪费。有的厂已经按问题的性质成立了若干个专门小组，边反边改；有的厂正在召开技术、材料供应、财务和老工人等专门会议，进一步揭发浪费现象。各厂职工揭发的大量事实，说明北京市地方工业的企业管理混乱和生产技术落后是造成浪费的根本原因。北京市金属结构厂的职工揭发，由于管理不善，这个厂去年就浪费了六万个工作日。北京市玻璃厂有一个工段在一年中仅废品的损失即达二十五万元。这个厂的职工指出反对产品质量低劣和改变技术落后状况，是本厂反浪费的主要关键问题，他们要求领导上迅速研究改进。在反浪费运动中，许多工厂一方面发动群众揭发，一方面派人到先进单位学习。清河制呢厂的职工揭发了本厂回染率高，用料多，染一公尺哔叽要四角五分，而上海国营第三毛纺厂只要两角多钱，现在，这个厂已经派出一批人到上海去学习。北京市地方工业的主管部门，正准备组织全市各同类工厂之间以及和外地先进工厂进行评比。
    在建筑部门，近两万建筑工人正以反浪费为中心课题进行冬训；另外三万多工人白天在工地和严寒搏斗，晚上向浪费现象开火。在开始的时候，有些单位的建筑工人曾以主人翁态度进行自我检查。领导上为了更好地发动群众，立即号召大家把反浪费的矛头首先指向领导，指向管理。电报大楼工地技术副主任冯贵成并且在大字报上检查了由于自己领导不力造成八千多元损失的事件。领导上这种用行动表示“引火烧身”决心的办法，更加鼓舞起群众揭发浪费的热情。现在被建筑工人们揭发的，主要是造成基本建设中严重浪费的工程质量低劣和工程成本过高这两大关键问题。他们在大字报上揭露：在修建国营北京第三棉纺织厂时，事先没有很好试验，就推广了白灰炉渣抹地坪的经验，造成了四千多平方公尺地坪返工，浪费国家资金三千多元。许多建筑工地由于没有坚持无合同、无预算、无施工组织设计概不开工这三条规定，造成施工中盲目备料、劳动力调配不当等浪费现象，正在陆续地被揭发出来。
    财贸系统的职工向经营管理不善，流转费用浩大，商品大量损耗等严重的浪费现象展开进攻。在运动开始后的六、七天内，职工们揭发了财贸系统很多令人触目惊心的浪费现象。北京市食品公司在去年一年内因对活体商品（活猪等）估称过高和饲养不善造成的亏称、死亡，共赔钱一千多万元。蔬菜公司因盲目进货造成积压，去年八、九两月使三十万斤西红柿和十四万斤冬瓜完全腐烂变质。干果经营处去年春节供应的春桔因保管不善有二十多万斤霉烂了。这些单位的职工贴出大字报说，好好的东西烂掉了，我们心痛！现在商业系统的反浪费运动越来越猛。各单位同时已开始着手研究学习先进企业的管理经营，开展比费用水平、比损耗、比措施等活动。
    在这个运动开始以前，中共北京市委分别召集了这些部门的党员负责干部，就整风运动中当前的工作重点进行了讨论。根据这些单位的一般整改已经结束、紧缩机构下放干部的工作多数已经完成、生产高潮已经出现、职工群众对本企业的严重浪费现象进行了大量揭发的情况，决定把已经开展和正在准备开展的社会主义大辩论，直接引导到有关促进生产跃进方面的问题上来，并且立即划出一段时间，集中力量开展一个群众性的反浪费运动，同时，结合各单位的实际情况，开展反对保守思想、提高产品、工程或服务质量的斗争。在这个斗争中，首先发动全体职工，大胆地、坚决地、彻底地把各方面的浪费现象都充分揭露出来。揭发浪费的目的，不在于追究责任，而是总结经验教训，改掉浪费，鼓足干劲，推动生产、经营大跃进。同时还要在相同的单位之间展开大评比，比产量、比质量、比成本、比品种、比经营管理，用可能达到的最高标准要求自己。大辩论就从这些问题开始。在上述精神指导下，各厂矿、建筑、交通运输和财贸系统，在发动群众的时候，都曾首先向全体职工讲解国际、国内的革命形势和任务，讲清多快好省、勤俭建国的进行社会主义建设的方针，使广大职工不仅从经济而且从政治上了解了反浪费运动的意义。
