Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: This year, China's steel industry plans to produce 7.32 million tons of pig iron, 6.24 million tons of steel, and 4.82 million tons of commercial steel products. These figures were recommended to the State Council by the State Economic Commission.

Compared with last year's estimated output, this year's planned output of the steel industry will increase by 24.1% for pig iron, 19.2% for steel, and 13.1% for steel products.

Since last year, provinces and cities across the country have actively built small and medium-sized iron smelting plants and mines. Therefore, the planned output of pig iron from local iron smelting industries this year has increased by 86% compared to last year. The pig iron output of these local iron smelting industries accounts for more than 15% of the total national pig iron output. The production capacity of iron ore mines nationwide has also been greatly improved. This year, the national output of iron ore is more than 24 million tons, and it is estimated that more than one million tons can be over-produced, which provides important conditions for over-fulfilling this year's steel production plan.

The revolutionary drive that emerged after the rectification campaign has led to repeated revisions of China's steel industry production plan, with each plan being more advanced and each output target higher than the last. The national steel industry production plan has now been distributed to factories and mines for discussion by workers. Judging from the current discussions in enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, this plan may be broken through by the enthusiasm of the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: This year, the steel production capacity of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry will have a leap-forward growth. This year, 1.036 million tons of steel and 1.38 million tons of iron production capacity will be put into production. This is the plan recently proposed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. This plan has been submitted to the State Council for approval.

This year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has more than 50 construction projects above the quota included in the construction plan. The iron smelting capacity to be put into production this year exceeds any year during the First Five-Year Plan period, equivalent to more than 44% of the newly added iron smelting capacity in the previous five years. The steel smelting capacity to be put into production this year is equivalent to more than 43% of the newly added steel smelting capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period.

Anshan Iron and Steel, a powerful steel base basically completed during China's First Five-Year Plan, will continue to build mines, ore dressing, sintering, steel smelting, steel rolling, refractory materials, and power systems this year.

The construction work of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel, two large steel bases that began construction during the First Five-Year Plan, will be unprecedentedly busy and intense this year. Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace can be put into production this year. To meet the needs of putting this project into production, more than 20 systems of Wuhan Iron and Steel, including coking and chemical industry, sintering, mining and power, railways, highways, water supply and drainage, will be under intense construction this year. The main projects of Baotou Iron and Steel, such as the first automated large blast furnace, coking plant, and iron ore mine, will also start construction this year. In China's Yunnan, Hunan, Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui and other provinces, metallurgical factories will also be started this year.

The use of capital construction investment by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry this year thoroughly implements the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, and building the country with diligence and thrift. This year, about 90% of the ministry's investment is used for projects above the quota, thereby ensuring the progress of key projects; at the same time, it also takes care of the investment in small projects that do not cost much and produce quick results. Last year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry built a total of more than 2 million square meters of new dormitories, and this year it only plans to build 560,000 square meters. This year, investment in productive construction accounts for about 96% of the total investment, and investment in non-productive construction accounts for about 4%. Investment in non-productive construction is lower than any year during the First Five-Year Plan period. According to the new situation of the industrial production and construction upsurge that is emerging across the country after the rectification campaign, and according to the central government's task of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also included some projects that were not prepared to be included in this year's construction plan in this year's plan according to specific conditions, in order to advance construction and accelerate the development of the steel industry.

    钢铁战士们开始十五年赶上英国的长征
    今年要炼钢六百二十四万吨
    钢铁生产能力将比去年各增加一百万吨以上
    新华社25日讯　今年我国钢铁工业计划生产七百三十二万吨生铁，六百二十四万吨钢和四百八十二万吨商品钢材。这是国家经济委员会向国务院建议的数字。
    今年钢铁工业的计划产量同去年预计产量比较，生铁增长24.1％，钢增长19.2％，钢材增长13.1％。
    去年以来，全国各省市积极地建设了中小型的炼铁厂和矿山，因此，今年地方炼铁工业的生铁计划产量比去年增加了86％；这些地方炼铁工业的生铁产量占全国生铁总产量的15％以上。全国铁矿的生产能力也大大提高了，今年全国的铁矿石产量是二千四百多万吨，估计还可以超额生产一百多万吨，这为超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划提供了重要条件。
    整风以后出现的革命干劲，使我国钢铁工业的生产计划再次修改，计划一次比一次先进，产量一次比一次提高。现在全国钢铁工业的生产计划已下达到各厂矿，交给职工讨论。从鞍钢和石景山钢铁厂等企业目前讨论的情况来看，这个计划可能被群众的干劲所突破。
    新华社25日讯　今年冶金工业部的钢铁生产能力将有飞跃的增长，今年将有一百零三点六万吨钢和一百三十八万吨铁的生产能力投入生产。这是冶金部最近提出的计划。这个计划已提请国务院批准。
    冶金工业部今年列入建设计划的限额以上的工程项目有五十多个。今年将要投入生产的炼铁能力超过了第一个五年计划期间的任何一年，等于前五年新增加炼铁能力的44％以上；今年将要投入生产的炼钢能力，等于第一个五年计划期间新增加的炼钢能力的43％以上。
    我国第一个五年计划期间基本上建成的强大的钢铁基地鞍钢，今年仍然要继续建设矿山、选矿、烧结、炼钢、轧钢、耐火材料和动力等系统等工程。
    第一个五年计划期间开始建设的两个大钢铁基地武钢和包钢的建设工作今年空前繁忙紧张。武钢一号高炉在今年就可以投入生产。为着这一工程投入生产的需要，武钢的炼焦化工、烧结、矿山和动力、铁路、公路、供水排水等二十多个系统的工程，今年都要进行紧张的建设。包钢的第一座自动化大型高炉、焦化厂和铁矿山等主要工程，今年也要开工建设。在我国的云南、湖南、河北、山西、安徽等省，今年也都有冶金工厂开工兴建。
    冶金部今年基本建设投资的使用，贯彻执行了多快好省和勤俭建国的方针。今年这个部90％左右的投资用到了限额以上的工程，从而保证了重点工程的进度；同时也照顾了那些花钱不多、收效很快的小工程的投资。去年冶金部新建宿舍共二百多万平方公尺，今年只计划修建五十六万平方公尺；今年用于生产性建设的投资占全部投资的96％左右，非生产性建设的投资占4％左右；非生产性建设的投资低于第一个五年计划期间任何一年。根据整风后全国正在出现的工业生产建设高潮这一新的形势，根据中央提出十五年后在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国这一任务，冶金部把去年没有准备列入今年建设计划的某些项目，也根据具体条件列入了今年的计划，以提前建设，加速钢铁工业的发展。
