  Soviet Writers Discuss Linguistic Problems
    Recently, Moscow writers gathered to discuss linguistic issues. Prominent Soviet linguist Academician Vinogradov delivered a speech on Stalin's papers on Marxism in linguistics last summer. He elaborated on the importance of Stalin's series of papers, which explained that language is a social phenomenon with its own characteristics, and that the development of language is related to the history of the people. Vinogradov quoted Gorky's views on language. Gorky called language the material of literature. "We must pursue the high expressiveness of words and the power to evoke associations. We can achieve this goal if we train ourselves to respect language, distinguish between good and bad language, and no longer distort words, making them difficult to understand and ugly. The simpler the words, the greater the power of the sentence." Vinogradov concluded: "Analyzing a writer's style and his language, as well as analyzing the relationship between his language and the common language of the people, should be the common goal of linguists, writers, and critics." After his speech was published, it aroused much discussion among writers, who unanimously believed that Stalin's papers had unusually profound scientific ideas and contained an inexhaustible source of creative inspiration, and were directly related to the cause of Soviet writers. While the rulers of the capitalist world are engaged in a policy of launching new wars, the leaders of the Soviet government have published fine scientific works on linguistics, which proves the greatness of the leaders of the Soviet people and the unshakable belief of the Soviet Union in peace and cultural undertakings. Attendees unanimously pointed out that writers must pay full attention to the skills of literary works and make full use of the wealth of the Russian language, so that their thoughts and feelings can be expressed through perfect forms. Fadeyev, chairman of the Soviet Writers' Association, said: "The language of literary works must be pursued with tireless effort. The labor spent on language is no less than the creation of characters and the structure of works. You cannot publish a prose work without revising it three, four, or even five or ten times." At the end of the discussion, a resolution was passed: all parts of the Writers' Association must continue to discuss Stalin's brilliant works on language and strive for the perfection of the skills of the works.
  Paintings of Chairman Mao at the All-Soviet Art Exhibition
    At the All-Soviet Art Exhibition held in Moscow in December 1950, some paintings of Chairman Mao by Soviet painters were displayed.
    Georgy Nabandyan, a young Georgian painter who won the Stalin Prize, is good at depicting Stalin and his comrades in oil paintings. He painted "Marshal Stalin Meets Chairman Mao." In this painting, the painter conveyed the historical brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, which is deeply reflected in the peaceful and sincere images of Stalin and Chairman Mao. The painter carefully described Chairman Mao's steady, simple, and humble demeanor, but the facial expressions were handled too tensely, and Chairman Mao's character was not fully and correctly expressed.
    The prints of the Stalin Prize winner, painter Fino-Grantov, mostly depict the historical process of the Chinese revolution and major events in the lives of the people of New China, as well as portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, all of which have unique success.
  Korean Literary and Art Workers Surge to the Front
    After the start of the Korean War for the Defense of the Fatherland, Korean literary and art workers have formed more than 130 literary and art work teams, active in the war zone and the rear. In the early days of the war, more than 40 writers, including Han Xueye, Li Taijun, and Xuan Qingjun, went to the front. They created many works. "Front Literature Series" has been published, including excellent works such as "For the Motherland," "Heroic Battle Collection," and "Oath to the Motherland." Composers such as Zheng Lvcheng and Li Mianxiang wrote songs such as "We Are the Tank Troops," "People's Guerrilla Warfare Song," and "Ode to the Torpedo Boat." Filmmakers produced documentaries such as "Appeal to the People of the World" and "Just War." With the victorious development of the war, more literary and art workers flocked to the front. Poet Zhao Bitang is collecting the heroic deeds of the Anzhou Juvenile Guerrilla Team in combating the American aggressors. Other literary and art workers are using various creative forms to record and sing the heroic struggle and brilliant victory of the Korean people. Literary and art workers fighting on the front also bravely dedicated their lives and blood. The famous actress Huang Xinzi (female), dancer Li Xichao (female), and film actor Liu Xuan have gloriously sacrificed their lives in their work on the front, and the famous actor Huang Che was blown off an arm. Now there are more than 100 literary and art workers working selflessly for the motherland on the front and in the guerrillas.

  苏联作家讨论语言学问题
    最近莫斯科作家集会讨论关于语言学的问题。著名苏联语言学家费诺格拉特夫院士在会上发表关于去年夏季斯大林论马克思主义在语言学中的问题的论文。他详细阐述斯大林的一系列的论文的重要性。这些论文说明了语言是一种具有特性的社会现象，它们说明了语言的发展与人民的历史的关系。费诺格拉特夫引用了高尔基对于语言的见解。高尔基把语言称为文学的构成材料。“我们必须追求文字的高度的表现性和引起联想的力量。我们是能够达到这目的的，只要我们训练我们自己，使我们能够尊敬语言，把好的与坏的语言区别开，不再歪曲文字，使它们变得不易了解和丑恶。文字越简洁，语句的力量也更大。”费诺格拉特夫结语说：“分析一个作家的文体和他的语言，以及分析他的语言与人民的通用语言之间的关系，应该是语言学家、文学家和评论家共同努力的对象。”他的论文发表后，引起了许多作家的讨论，一致认为斯大林的论文具有异常深刻的科学思想，和含有无穷的创造的灵感的源泉，并且和苏联作家的事业有直接关系。当资本主义世界的统治者从事于发动新战争的政策时，苏联政府的领袖却发表了精粹的关于语言学的科学著作，这证明了苏联人民领袖的伟大和苏联对和平、文化事业的不可动摇的信念。出席者一致指出作家必须充分注意文学作品的技巧和充分利用俄罗斯语言的财富，使他们的思想与感情通过完美的形式而表现出来。苏联作家协会主席法捷耶夫说：“文学作品的语言必须以辛勤不倦的努力来从事。在语言上所用的劳力并不少于人物创造和作品的结构上。你不能不经过三次、四次，甚至五次、十次的修改，就能发表一部散文作品。”讨论会结束时通过了一个决议：作家协会各部分必须继续讨论斯大林论语言的天才著作并为作品的技巧的完美而奋斗。
  全苏艺术展览会上关于毛主席的绘画
    在一九五○年十二月在莫斯科举行的全苏艺术展览会上，陈列了苏联画家的一些关于毛主席的绘画。
    斯大林奖金获得者乔治亚青年画家纳班江是以油画描写斯大林及其战友的能手，画了《斯大林大元帅和毛主席会见》。在这幅画中，画家传达出了历史性的中苏两国人民兄弟的友谊，深刻体现在斯大林和毛主席的安详、真诚的形象上。毛主席稳重、朴实、谦虚的神态，画家做到了认真的描写，但在面部表情上处理的过分紧张，没有完全正确地表现毛主席的性格。
    斯大林奖金获得者，画家费诺格诺夫的版画，大都是描写中国革命的历史过程和新中国人民生活重大的事件，及毛主席和朱总司令的肖像，都有独到的成功。
  朝鲜文艺工作者涌上前线
    朝鲜卫国战争开始后，朝鲜的文学艺术工作者，已经组成了一百三十多个文艺工作队，活跃在战地和后方。在战争初期，曾有韩雪野、李泰俊、玄卿俊等四十多位作家走上了前线。他们创作了很多作品。现已出版了《战线文库》一种，其中有《为了祖国》、《英雄战斗集》、《给祖国宣誓》等优秀作品。郑律成、李冕相等作曲家写下了《我们是坦克部队》、《人民游击战歌》、《鱼雷艇颂》等歌曲。电影工作者摄制了《告世界人民》、《正义战争》的记录片。随着战争的胜利发展，文艺工作者们更多地涌向了前线。诗人赵碧宕正在收集安州少年游击队打击美国侵略军的英雄事迹。其他的文艺工作者们都正在运用各种创作形式来记录和歌颂朝鲜人民的英雄斗争和光辉的胜利。战斗在前线的文艺工作者也英勇地献出了自己的生命与鲜血。著名的演员黄信子（女），舞蹈家李熙朝（女），电影演员柳玄等在前线工作中已光荣牺牲，名演员黄澈被炸断了一只臂膀。现在还有一百多位文艺工作者在前线以及游击队里忘我地为祖国工作着。
