　　The Masses Urgently Demand the Promotion of Acupuncture Therapy

　　Since the introduction of acupuncture therapy in this newspaper, it has been warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses. Zhu Lian, of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, a warm advocate of this therapy, has recently received an average of about 40 letters from readers across the country every day. The number of people who come to request treatment every day also reaches 40 to 50, and some even come from afar from other regions. The content of letters from various places fully expresses the masses' support for acupuncture therapy. They eagerly hope that the medical circles of New China will give due attention to this acupuncture science with a long history, and demand that it be rapidly promoted in the vast cities and rural areas to save thousands upon thousands of patients. Many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are calling for the universal promotion of acupuncture therapy. For example, Dr. Guo Yinnan of Yonghegong Street in Beijing wrote: "I was very excited after seeing the article on acupuncture therapy published by Comrade Zhu Lian. Acupuncture has a strong belief among the broad masses of people in the vast rural areas of China, and it is also more economical in treatment, which is in line with the current national economic conditions, and it is indeed necessary to promote it." He has two specific suggestions: "First, we must quickly organize acupuncture training classes to explain the efficacy of acupuncture with scientific theories and cultivate a large number of acupuncture talents. Second, acupuncture treatment departments should be added to various clinics in Beijing in the short term, on the one hand to cooperate with treatment work, and on the other hand to study the efficacy and effect of medical treatment." Dr. Li Qinglin of Sanzhuan Bridge, District 3, Beijing wrote: "For the future health of the broad masses, I suggest that acupuncture should be vigorously promoted, the practical efficacy of acupuncture should be promoted, and the backward acupuncture workers should be reformed so that the broad masses of patients can be saved." Dr. Tang Jingsheng of Zongmao Hutong, District 4, Beijing wrote: "The reason why acupuncture in our country has not been eliminated so far is that it has thousands of years of valuable experience. Patients come to see doctors from time to time, and they are cured by acupuncture without expecting it." He suggested that "Chinese medicine acupuncture comrades should take this opportunity to gather together, jointly study the principles of acupuncture, encourage each other, exchange experiences and knowledge, and selflessly provide the effects and experiences of acupuncture treatment in the past." In his letter, he expressed to Comrade Zhu Lian: "I am willing to study. Although I am a little older, my desire to learn is no less than that of young people. If I can get further education, I am willing to go to the countryside to serve the working people." The Chinese Medicine Research Association of Putai County, Shandong, the Suzhou Chinese Acupuncture Research Society, and many Chinese medicine practitioners in Guangzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou and other places have sent many similar letters. On the part of the masses, Ms. Fan Moyan, 52, of Erlizhuang outside Dongzhimen, Beijing, said in a letter to Comrade Zhu Lian: "If you allow me to study, I will definitely be willing to learn from you. In the past, I worked as a technician in the pathology laboratory of Peking Union Medical College for nine years, and I also entered a Chinese medicine correspondence school, wanting to study some of the theories of Chinese medicine. However, the textbooks sent were all about gold, wood, water, fire, earth, yin, yang, birth, and restraint, which made me dizzy and felt too far away from scientific therapy and too unscientific, and I couldn't read them at all, and I didn't learn anything. I now live in the suburbs outside the city, where there are too many poor people who have no money to treat their illnesses and dare not treat them." Therefore, she begged to "accept her as an old student who is willing to study acupuncture." In addition, Professor Zhang Guangyan of the Department of Dentistry of Peking University Medical College also wrote to Comrade Zhu Lian, saying: "Although I am a 'Western medicine' doctor; I will never resist 'Chinese medicine', because I deeply feel that curing the disease is the truth. Why is there a distinction between Chinese and Western medicine! Moreover, we are all medical workers, and we are both serving the people, so there is a necessary for close connection. This is the attitude I want to declare. The following is my request: In our Peking University Dental Clinic, there are many patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Although we use alcohol injection or nerve resection and other treatments; however, this method cannot satisfy the patients, and even we ourselves are not satisfied. Because after the operation, the patient's face loses sensation and there is a possibility of recurrence. We request you to take some time to come to our clinic once a week to provide acupuncture treatment specifically for patients with trigeminal neuralgia. This will not only relieve the pain of patients, but also be a good way to promote acupuncture therapy." Ge Yingwu, Dean of the North China Cadre Sanatorium, wrote that there are eleven patients in their sanatorium who want to be treated with acupuncture therapy and asked Comrade Zhu Lian to help. Li QinFang, a teacher in the Department of Anatomy of Tianjin Military Medical University, wrote: "I have liked to study acupuncture early on, and I have also done it practically for several years, but I have not yet achieved success. At present, I am working on the "relationship between different parts of the human body and certain acupoints". I plan to truly find the accurate anatomical position of certain acupoints on the surface from anatomy, and look for connections in the central nervous system (especially the spinal cord), in order to discover the root cause, find the law, and explain the effect of certain holes on certain organs. I also want to use scientific methods to study "the beginning and end of meridians" to see if they are all illusory." Therefore, he hopes to "maintain a certain connection in work" with Comrade Zhu Lian. The vast number of patients have written to request acupuncture treatment. Many letters from readers and patients have expressed their inner urgent demands, suggesting that the new acupuncture therapy be rapidly promoted to the masses. Recently, the General Affairs Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, the Logistics Department of the Second Division of the Public Security of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Tianjin Municipal Second Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital, the Chahar Provincial Health Bureau, the Medical Office of the Liaoxi Chemical Plant and other agencies, departments or individuals have also written to Comrade Zhu Lian, introducing doctors Zhang Zhiyi, Teng Yisheng, Cheng Heng and others to learn acupuncture therapy.

　　群众迫切要求推广针灸疗法
    针灸疗法自本报介绍后，获得了广大群众极热烈的欢迎与拥护。这一疗法的热心提倡者中央人民政府卫生部妇幼卫生局朱琏同志近日来每日平均收到各地读者来信约四十封。前往请求治疗的每日亦达四、五十人。且有从其他地区远道而来的。各地来信的内容，充分表露了群众对针灸疗法的拥护，他们非常热切地祈望着新中国的医学界对这具有悠久历史的针灸学，给以应有的重视，要求能迅速地把它广泛地进行于广大城市和农村，拯救千千万万的病患者。许多中医要求普遍提倡针灸疗法。如北京市雍和宫大街的郭荫楠大夫来信说：“见到朱琏同志发表的关于针灸疗法的文章后，甚为兴奋。针灸在全中国广大的乡村人民群众中，有浓厚的信仰，且在治疗上也比较经济，这也合乎目前国家经济条件，实有提倡之必要。”他有两点具体建议，“一、要迅速组织针灸学习班，用科学理论来解释针灸的效能，大量培养针灸人材。二、在短期内北京市各门诊部应添设针灸治疗部，一面为配合治疗工作，一面也可研究医疗的功效与作用。”北京市三区三转桥李庆林大夫来信说：“为了广大群众将来的健康，我建议应大力提倡针灸，发扬针灸的实效功能，并改造落后的针灸工作者，以使广大的病人得以拯救。”北京市四区宗帽胡同唐镜生大夫来信说：“我国针灸迄今所以不能泯灭者，实具有数千年宝贵的经验，时有患者就诊，每用针灸不期然而愈。”他提议“中医针灸同志们，应趁此时机，萃聚一堂，共同研讨针灸原理，互相砥砺，交换心得与知识，将过去用针灸治疗效果与经验，不自私的提供出来。”他在信上向朱琏同志表示：“愿随学习。本人年岁虽稍长，好学的心情不亚于青年。倘能得到深造，即下乡为劳动人民服务均所愿往。”山东蒲台县中医研究会，苏州中国针灸学研究社、以及广州、无锡、杭州等地的许多中医，都寄来了许多类似这样的信件。在群众方面，北京东直门外二里庄五十二岁的范默奄女士在信上对朱琏同志说：“如果您允许我学习，我一定愿向您学习的。过去我在协和医校病理科试验室做过九年的技士，也曾入过中医函授学校，想研究些中医的学理。但寄来的课本里，竟是些金、木、水、火、土、阴、阳、生、克，将我弄得头昏，觉得离着科学疗法太远，太不科学，一点也读不下去，什么也没有学成。我现住在城外关厢，此地穷人太多，有病无钱治，也不敢治。”因此她恳求“接受她这位愿学习针灸的老学生。”此外，北京大学医学院牙学系张光炎教授也给朱琏同志写信说：“我虽是个‘西医’；但决不抵抗‘中医’，因为我深深感到治好了病就是真理。何有中、西之分！况且我们都是医务工作者，同是为人民服务，实有密切连系的必要。这是我要申明的态度。以下是我的请求：在我们北大牙科门诊部里，有许多三义神经痛患者，我们虽然施用酒精注射或神经切除等疗法；但是此法不能使患者满意，就连我们自己也都不满意。因为在施手术后患者面部失去知觉，而且有复发的可能。我们请求您分出一点时间，每星期来我们门诊部一次，专为三义神经痛患者作针灸治疗，此不但解除患者痛苦，也是推广针灸疗法的一个好办法。”华北干部疗养院院长葛英武来信说，他们疗养院中有十一名病患者想用针灸疗法医治，要求朱琏同志能去帮助。天津军医大学解剖学系教员李沁舫来信说：“我在早便也喜欢研究针灸，并且也切实做了几年，但尚无成就。目前我正在做“人体不同部位与一定穴位的关系”的工作，我打算经解剖学上，真正在外表上求得一定穴位的准确解剖位置，并在中枢神经（特别是脊髓）里，寻求连系，以便发现根源，找到规律，把一定的孔穴作用于一定的脏器，能加以说明。还想用科学的办法来研究“经络起止”看是否全属玄虚。”因此，他希望与朱琏同志“保持工作上一定的连系。”广大的病患者纷纷来信要求施以针灸治疗。许多读者和病患者的来信都表示了他们内心的迫切要求，建议迅速推广新针灸疗法到群众中去。近日来，军委总政治部总务处、中国人民解放军公安第二师后勤处、天津市立第二结核病防治院、察哈尔省卫生局、辽西化工厂医务所等机关，部门或个人也都写信给朱琏同志，介绍医师张志一、滕毅生、程恒等学习针灸疗法。
