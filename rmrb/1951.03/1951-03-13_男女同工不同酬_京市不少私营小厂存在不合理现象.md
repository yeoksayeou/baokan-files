　　Unequal Pay for Equal Work

    Unreasonable Phenomena Exist in Many Small Private Factories in Beijing

To the Editor:

    In some small private factories in Beijing, the unreasonable phenomena of unequal pay for equal work between men and women, unequal access to labor insurance benefits for men and women, and women workers being treated as temporary workers for extended periods still exist. This seriously violates the policy of "developing production for the benefit of both labor and capital" and the wage policy of "payment according to work," hindering the development of production. For example, in the He Xing Binding Bureau in the Sixth District, there are 18 male workers, all of whom are paid a monthly salary. Among the 14 female workers, 12 are paid on a piece-rate basis. (Note: The piece-rate wage system is a more advanced form of wage payment and should be promoted, but what is being criticized here is unequal pay for equal work.) In addition to providing male workers with 100 jin of millet per month for food, the capitalist also distributes a welfare bonus of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per person per month from the sale of paper scraps. Female workers not only do not receive a food allowance, but also do not share in the money from the sale of paper scraps. The actual monthly wage (including salary, food, and commission) of male workers is a minimum of 310 jin and a maximum of 460 jin, with an average of 410 jin. The highest wage for female workers is only 360 jin, and the lowest is 100 jin. The average wage difference between male and female workers is as high as 170 jin. However, the technical requirements in this factory are not high, and the only slight difference is in the level of labor skill, yet the wage disparity is so great, which is unreasonable. In the private Fuxing Binding Bureau in the same district, in addition to receiving a food allowance of 70 jin of millet per month, male workers are also provided with expenses for two haircuts and baths per month, and overtime pay for overtime work. However, the 15 female workers do not receive food allowances, overtime pay, or welfare benefits such as haircuts and baths. The average actual monthly wage of male workers is 337 jin, while the average actual wage of female workers is 116 jin, which is 221 jin less than that of male workers. The female workers in this factory have repeatedly raised suggestions for improvement with the capitalist, but have not been resolved. Similar phenomena of unequal pay for equal work between men and women also exist in other factories, such as the private Xin Jian Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory and the Global Pencil Factory.

    In terms of welfare, the treatment of male and female workers is also unequal in many factories and shops. For example, in the Jian Bei Factory in the Second District, the factory is responsible for the medical treatment of male workers when they are sick, but not for female workers. The capitalist of the private Dalu Binding Shop gives 50% of the waste paper scraps to the workers as a welfare bonus, but refuses to give it to female workers. For example, when female worker Bai Suzhen wanted wages during her maternity leave, she was denied the welfare bonus, with the capitalist arguing that the two could not be combined. The Municipal Labor Bureau believes that using paper scrap money for welfare is acceptable, but it should not be mixed with maternity leave wages. The Labor Insurance Regulations clearly stipulate that wages should be paid during maternity leave. Although the Labor Bureau has mediated many times on this matter, the capitalist firmly refuses to accept it and it has now been submitted to the Arbitration Committee for arbitration.

    The work done by binding female workers in the printing industry, tassel-making and shaft-winding female workers in the textile and dyeing industry, and packaging female workers in the cigarette industry are all indispensable processes in production. Many of these female workers in the city have been working for more than six months, and some have even been working for five or six years, but they are still treated as temporary workers and cannot enjoy labor insurance benefits. For example, this is the case for more than 100 female workers in factories such as the Sanming Asbestos Factory in the First District, the Tonglihe Thread Factory and the Xinjiang Clothing Factory in the Seventh District. This situation of treating female workers as temporary workers for extended periods of time is another manifestation of unequal pay for equal work between men and women, which is very unreasonable and should be resolved quickly.
              
Reader Li Ming

    Editor's Note: The phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work between men and women that exists in many small private factories in Beijing reflects the old society's view of belittling women; it is also a concrete manifestation of the fact that Article 6 of the Common Program "…women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational and social life…" and the wage policy of "payment according to work, more pay for more work" have not yet been universally implemented. This unreasonable phenomenon that violates policy must be corrected. Only by correcting this erroneous phenomenon can we encourage female workers to actively participate in production and protect the special interests of female workers. We hope that the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, and the Industrial Bureau can pay attention to the situation reflected by the reader, and further conduct in-depth investigations and research to propose effective improvement measures. In addition, we also request readers from all regions, especially female worker comrades, to frequently report to the Party newspaper on the situations, problems, and difficulties of female workers on the production front, so as to strengthen the connection between the Party newspaper and female workers.

### 男女同工不同酬  京市不少私营小厂存在不合理现象

　　男女同工不同酬
    京市不少私营小厂存在不合理现象编辑同志：
    北京市某些私营小型工厂，现在仍存在着男女工同工不同酬、男女工享受劳动保险福利不平等及女工长期被当为临时工等不合理现象，严重地违背了“发展生产劳资两利”和“按劳取酬”的工资政策，阻碍着生产的发展。如：六区合兴装订局有男工十八人，都是月薪；而十四名女工中，十二名是按件计资（按：计件工资制是进一步的工资形式，是应该提倡的，这里所批判的是同工不同酬）。资方除供给男工每月伙食一百斤小米外，每月每人并可分得卖纸边的福利金六、七万元；女工不但不能领到伙食费，也不能分卖纸边钱。男工每月实得工资（包括工资、伙食、提成），最低的是三一○斤，最高的是四六○斤，平均为四一○斤；女工最高的仅三六○斤，最低的一百斤，平均工资较男工相差竟达一七○斤。但该厂工人的技术性并不大，仅是劳动熟练程度稍有差异，而工资却悬殊很大，这是不合理的。该区私营复兴装订局，男工每月除可领伙食费七十斤小米外，资方并供给他们二次理发、洗澡的费用，加班时有加班费；而十五个女工则无伙食费、加班费和理发、洗澡等福利待遇。男工每月实得工资平均三三七斤，女工实得工资平均为一一六斤，竟较男工少二二一斤之多。该厂女工曾多次向资方提出改进意见，迄未获得解决。其他如私营新建化学制药厂、环球铅笔厂，也有这类男女工同工不同酬现象。
    在福利方面，很多厂店男女工的待遇也是不平等的。如二区建北工厂男工有病，厂方负责治；女工有病则不管。私营大陆装订所资方以废纸边百分之五十分给工人作为福利金，而拒绝发给女工。如女工白素珍要产假期间的工资，则不给福利金，资方意见是二者不可兼得。市劳动局认为用纸边钱作福利是可以的，但不应和产假工资混在一起，产假应发工资在劳动保险条例中已有明文规定。此事虽经劳动局调解多次，资方坚不接受，现已提交仲裁委员会仲裁。
    印刷业的装订女工，织染业的打穗打轴女工，卷烟业的包装女工所作的工作，都是生产中不可缺少的过程。而本市这类女工很多都是工作了六个月以上，有的甚至工作了五、六年的工人，但现在仍按临时工看待，不能享受劳动保险福利待遇。如一区三明石棉厂，七区同立合线厂、新建被服厂等的一百多名女工都是这样。这种长期视女工为临时工的情况，是男女工同工不同酬的另一种表现形式，是非常不合理的，应该很快求得解决。
              读者  黎明
    编者按：目前北京市不少私营小厂中所存在的男女同工不同酬的现象，是旧社会的轻视妇女观点；也是共同纲领第六条“……妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。……”，及“按劳付酬，多劳多得”的工资政策至今仍未能普遍执行的具体表现。这种违反政策的不合理的现象必须加以纠正，只有纠正了这一错误现象，才能鼓励女工积极参加生产，保护女工的特殊利益。我们希望北京市总工会、市民主妇女联合会及工业局能重视读者所反映的情况，并进一步深入调查研究，提出有效的改进办法。此外，我们并要求各地读者，特别是女工同志，能经常向党报反映女工在生产战线上的情况、问题和困难，以便加强党报和女工的联系。
