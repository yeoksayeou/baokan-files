Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The American people's voices demanding peace, withdrawal from Korea, and condemning the Truman administration's war policies are growing louder.

The American capitalist Gallup poll recently conducted surveys across the country, the results of which show that 50% of Americans believe that the United States "made a mistake by participating in the Korean War." The institute also compared the results of this survey with those of a survey conducted in August of last year, when only 20% of Americans believed that "participation in the war was a mistake."

The American Worker's Daily reported on February 26th that a survey conducted by the Chicago Daily News among its readers showed that more than two-thirds of the people of Chicago (one of the largest cities in the United States) advocate withdrawing from Korea.

The American people's opposition to the war of aggression is also expressed in letters to local newspapers. The "Capital Times" published in Madison, Wisconsin, published a reader's letter stating: "We ourselves admit that we are killing tens of thousands of innocent Korean civilians and turning that blood-stained land into scorched earth. Is this the policy we are using to win friends in Asia?" The Los Angeles Herald Express published a reader's letter saying: "I demand an end to the slaughter. I demand that our lives be taken seriously." The Chicago Daily News published a letter from a "lame Chicago veteran" saying: "Send Truman, Dewey, and all the war-mongers to Korea, and bring our children back." Reuters pointed out that this type of letter appearing in American newspapers is becoming more and more common.

　　美人民反战呼声日高
    【新华社九日讯】美国人民要求和平、要求撤出朝鲜，谴责杜鲁门政府战争政策的呼声，正越来越高。
    美国资产阶级的盖洛普民意测验所最近在全国各地调查的结果显示：有百分之五十的美国人认为美国“参加朝鲜战争是犯了错误”。该所并把这次调查的结果和去年八月调查的结果加以对照，当时还只有百分之二十的美国人认为“参战是一个错误”。
    美国工人日报二月二十六日报道，芝加哥《每日新闻》在读者中进行调查的结果，表明三分之二以上的芝加哥（这是美国最大的城市之一）人民主张退出朝鲜。
    美国人民反对侵略战争的情绪也表现在给各地报纸的信件上。威斯康星州麦迪逊出版的《首府时代报》刊载一封读者来信说：“我们自己承认，我们正在杀害成千成万的无辜朝鲜平民，已把那块血迹遍野的土地化为焦土。我们要争取亚洲的朋友，难道就用这种政策吗？”洛杉矶先驱快报刊载一读者来信说：“我要求停止屠杀。我要求把我们的人命当一回事。”芝加哥《每日新闻》刊载一个“跛腿的芝加哥退伍军人”的信说：“把杜鲁门、杜威及所有战争贩子送到朝鲜去，把我们的孩子送回来。”电通社指出：出现在美国报纸上的这一类信件是越来越多了。
