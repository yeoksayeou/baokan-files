    Hebei Fengfeng Mining District Yihua Yarn Factory
    Doctor's Insult of Female Workers Case
    Central Authorities Investigate and Clarify, Propose Handling Opinions
    Editor's Note: The facts of the case of Guo Yueyu, a doctor at the state-owned Yihua Yarn Factory in Fengfeng Mining District, Hebei Province, raping female worker Lian Jiping are as follows: In July 1949, Lian Jiping (also working at the factory), the eldest daughter of Lian Haokun, an old worker at the factory, was ill and went to the clinic for treatment. Guo Yueyu, a doctor at the clinic, who has always had an improper work style, raped the fifteen-year-old female worker Lian Jiping. At the time, Lian Jiping was afraid of losing face and did not dare tell anyone about it. Later, because she felt unwell, she went to the clinic again for treatment. Doctor Guo Yueyu then discovered that Lian Jiping was pregnant and threatened Lian Jiping not to tell her parents, and forcibly performed an abortion on Lian Jiping. He gave Lian Jiping a total of twenty-two injections. Each time she received an injection, Lian Jiping bled two or three times. Finally, the child was aborted (already dead), but Lian Jiping's body suffered severe damage. Now Lian Jiping is unable to stand and is becoming disabled.
    Liu Jinfu, the deputy director of the factory's trade union, discovered this incident in June 1950 and repeatedly mobilized Lian Jiping; Lian Jiping then told the truth. The trade union questioned Guo Yueyu on June 18. However, Guo Yueyu quibbled and firmly denied it. The trade union had no choice but to send Guo Yueyu to the Hecunzhen Police Station.
    However, the factory director Hao Cheng shielded Guo Yueyu without any principles, not only bailing out the perpetrator but also reversing right and wrong, falsely accusing the old worker Lian Haokun of having illicit relations with his daughter Lian Jiping. He privately set up a court in the factory and detained the old worker Lian Haokun for two days. The insulted female worker Lian Jiping was fired by the factory in April 1950. Later, when the factory sent Lian Haokun and Guo Yueyu to the People's Court of the Mining District Government for handling, Hao Cheng also defended Guo Yueyu. Cui Guiyuan, the secretary of the factory's CCP branch, also had no stance and shielded the perpetrator.
    After interrogation, Guo Yueyu admitted the facts of the crime. The Mining District People's Court formally sentenced Guo Yueyu to two and a half years in prison on August 9th last year. The investigation process and handling opinions of relevant departments such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government are published below:
    After the Worker's Daily, the organ of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, published the relevant events of Guo Yueyu, a doctor at the Yihua Yarn Factory in Fengfeng Mining District, Hebei Province, raping female worker Lian Jiping, on the second page of its January 17th issue, it has aroused deep concern from all parties. On January 24th, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China organized a working group to conduct an in-depth investigation at the factory; the Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government immediately telegraphed Comrade Liu Dong, director of the Light Industry Department, to investigate on the spot, and telegraphed Director Hao Cheng to report the situation to the department; the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Handan Office of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Fengfeng Mining District Party Committee, the Fengfeng Mining District People's Supervision Committee, the Fengfeng Mining District Federation of Trade Unions, and the Mining District People's Court also sent people to the factory to investigate. After the working group arrived at the factory, they conducted repeated in-depth investigations among workers, staff, cadres, party members, villagers, cadres, neighbors, and parties concerned, and convened a factory-wide cadre meeting, a trade union committee meeting, and a staff meeting. By February 3rd, the entire case was finally clarified, and a unanimous understanding was reached.
    After the working group returned, on the afternoon of February 13th, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China invited representatives from the Central People's Supervision Committee, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, the Supreme People's Court, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, and the Worker's Daily to hold a symposium to report the investigation process and results. After research and discussion by representatives of various units, the following handling opinions were unanimously adopted and submitted to Hebei Province for reference in handling this issue (the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee has also instructed the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the CCP to immediately grasp and correctly resolve this issue):
    1.  Female worker Lian Jiping was raped by Guo Yueyu and illegally aborted, suffering severe damage. Guo Yueyu should be held responsible, and the administratively incorrect dismissal of Lian Jiping was also inappropriate. The administration should restore Lian Jiping's factory status, pay her back wages, and bear the cost of her medical treatment; if treatment is unsuccessful and she becomes disabled, Guo Yueyu should bear the main responsibility for Lian Jiping's living expenses, guaranteeing Lian Jiping's life and treatment.
    2.  Doctor Guo Yueyu disrupted the social order of the new democratic society, raped an underage woman, and illegally performed abortions, killing lives, which is a double violation of the law; at the same time, after the incident was exposed, he not only showed no remorse during interrogation, but also cunningly quibbled, relying on the support of the factory director and others to falsely accuse Lian Haokun and his daughter of having illicit relations, which is a great insult to the working class. Therefore, the local government's original sentence of two and a half years in prison is too lenient; the case should be retried, and the punishment should be increased according to law.
    3.  Factory director Hao Cheng is usually arrogant and does not rely on the working class, suppressing democracy; after the incident occurred, he did not rely on the masses, subjectively believed in bias, did not handle the matter based on facts, reversed right and wrong, privately set up a court, shielded criminals, insulted good people, and disrupted the law and discipline, causing a bad influence on the Party and the government among the masses. Therefore, he should be given the administrative punishment of dismissal from all positions held, and the Party committee and the government are advised to give him Party discipline and legal discipline punishment.
    4.  Cui Guiyuan, the secretary of the factory's Communist Party branch, lost the Communist Party's position and did not promptly correct or stop the occurrence of the mistake. Instead, he supported and obeyed Factory Director Hao Cheng and personally went to the government to defend the perpetrator Guo. The North China Bureau is advised to give him the punishment he deserves to educate the entire Party and Cui Guiyuan himself.
    5.  Yu Gaoxiang and Liu Jinfu, the director and deputy director of the factory's trade union, usually detached themselves from the masses and did not understand the insults and hardships suffered by the Lian family in this incident, resolutely protecting the interests of the workers and fighting against administrative mistakes, losing the position of the working class. Therefore, the higher-level trade union should give them the punishment of dismissal, and the staff and workers should re-elect them.
    6.  After accepting this case, the Fengfeng Mining District Government did not conduct the trial locally, but repeatedly interrogated Lian Jiping, who was only half a month postpartum and had not recovered, three times, requiring her to travel sixty li of mountain road each time, resulting in illness and her lower body still unable to stand upright. Such a working method that does not care for the suffering of the masses should be deeply reviewed.
    7.  The factory director, the director and deputy director of the trade union, and the secretary of the Party branch should conduct a deep self-criticism of the mistakes made in this incident in front of the workers and masses and publish it in the newspaper.
    8.  Comrade Gao Fudong of the Fengfeng Mining District Party Committee bravely stood on the position of the working class and exposed the truth and should be commended; the Minister of the Organization Department of the Fengfeng Mining District Party Committee failed to adhere to principles and ridiculed Gao Fudong for writing the manuscript and should conduct a self-criticism.

    河北峰峰矿区益华纱厂
    医生污辱女工案
    中央有关部门调查明白，提出处理意见
    编者按：河北省峰峰矿区省营益华纱厂医生郭月宇强奸女工连吉平的事实经过是这样：一九四九年七月间，该厂老工人连好坤的长女连吉平（亦在该厂做工）有病，到医务所看病。该所医生郭月宇历来作风不正派，就将十五岁的女工连吉平强奸了。当时，连吉平怕丢人，没敢向别人说出这事。后来，她因身体不舒服，又去医务所看病。医生郭月宇当时发现连吉平有孕，即威胁连吉平不许告诉其父母，并强行替连吉平打胎。先后共给连吉平打了二十二针。每打一次针，连吉平就流血两三次。最后，孩子打下来了（已死），连吉平的身体却遭受到严重的摧残。现连吉平下身已经不能站立，将成残废。
    该厂工会副主任刘金富于一九五○年六月间发现这一事件后，即向连吉平一再动员；连吉平才说出了真实的情形。工会于六月十八日追问郭月宇。但郭月宇强词夺理，坚不承认。工会不得已乃将郭月宇送到和村镇派出所。
    但是，该厂厂长郝诚却毫无原则地包庇郭月宇，不仅将郭犯保出，并颠倒是非，诬蔑老工人连好坤与其女连吉平通奸，在厂内私立公堂，将老工人连好坤押了两天。被侮辱的女工连吉平却被该厂于一九五○年四月间开除。后来该厂将连好坤、郭月宇送交矿区政府人民法院处理时，郝诚还替郭月宇辩护。该厂中共支部书记崔贵元亦毫无立场，包庇郭犯。
    经过审讯，郭月宇才承认了犯罪事实。矿区人民法院乃于去年八月九日正式判决郭月宇有期徒刑二年半。兹将全国总工会、中央人民政府纺织工业部等有关部门的调查经过和处理意见发表如下：
    中华全国总工会机关报工人日报一月十七日二版刊出了河北省峰峰矿区益华纱厂医生郭月宇强奸女工连吉平等有关事件之后，已引起了各方面之深切注意。一月二十四日，全国总工会、中央人民政府纺织工业部、中国纺织工会全国委员会即组织工作组到该厂进行深入调查；河北省人民政府工业厅当即电令轻工业处处长刘栋同志就地调查，电令郝诚厂长回厅报告情况；河北省总工会、河北省总工会邯郸办事处、峰峰矿区党委会、峰峰矿区人民监察委员会、峰峰矿区总工会、矿区人民法院等单位也派人到该厂去调查。工作组到该厂后，分别在工厂工人、职员、干部、党员，村中群众、干部、邻居、当事人等各方面再三深入调查，并召开了一次全厂干部会议、工会委员会会议和职工大会。到二月三日，终于把全部案件弄清，并取得了一致的认识。
    工作组回来后，二月十三日下午，全国总工会、中央人民政府纺织工业部、中国纺织工会全国委员会三个单位邀请中央人民监察委员会、中央人民政府劳动部、最高人民法院、全国民主妇联、中央人民政府卫生部、中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会、工人日报等单位代表，开了一次座谈会，报告了调查经过和调查结果。经过各单位代表的研究讨论，并一致通过以下处理意见，提交河北省处理这一问题时参考（中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会并已指示中共河北省委纪律检查委员会即时抓紧，正确解决这一问题）：
    一、女工连吉平，遭郭月宇强奸，且遭非法打胎，受到严重的摧残，郭月宇固应负责任，行政上错误地解雇连吉平，亦为不当。行政应恢复连吉平厂籍，补发其工资，负担疾病之医疗；如果治疗不愈而残废，连吉平之生活费应由郭月宇负主要的责任，保障连吉平的生活和治疗。
    二、医生郭月宇，破坏新民主主义社会秩序，强奸未成年之妇女，并非法打胎杀命，实属双重违法；同时，事件暴露后，审讯中不但无悔过表示，反狡诈诡辩，倚仗厂长等支持，诬赖连好坤父女通奸，这是对工人阶级莫大侮辱。因此，地方政府原判二年半的徒刑，实属太轻；应从新审判，依法加重治罪。
    三、厂长郝诚，平日骄傲自大不依靠工人阶级，压制民主；而事件发生后又不依靠群众，主观偏信，不据实办理，颠倒是非，私立公堂，庇护罪犯，污辱好人，破坏法纪，给党和政府在群众中造成了不良影响，故在行政上应给以撤销本兼各职的处分，并建议党委和政府给予党纪和法纪的处分。
    四、该厂共产党支部书记崔贵元，失去共产党的立场，没有及时纠正或制止错误的发生，反而支持顺从郝诚厂长，亲到政府替郭犯辩护，建议华北局给以应得处分，以教育全党和崔贵元本人。
    五、该厂工会正、副主任郁高翔、刘金福平时脱离群众，在此事件中又没有体会连氏父女所受的污辱与困苦、坚决保护工人利益、向行政上的错误作斗争，丧失了工人阶级的立场。因此，上级工会应给以撤职处分，由职工群众另行改选。
    六、峰峰矿区政府在受理此案后未到当地就审，让产后半月未恢复健康的连吉平连续提审三次，每次往返都要走六十里地山路，致成疾病，至今下身仍不能直立，如此不体贴群众疾苦的工作方法，应作深刻检讨。
    七、该厂厂长、工会正副主任、党支部书记应把此事件所犯错误在工人群众面前做深刻检讨，并在报纸上公布。
    八、峰峰矿区党委会高福东同志勇于站在工人阶级立场，暴露真相，应受表扬；峰峰矿区党委会组织部长不能坚持原则，讥讽高福东写稿，应做检讨。
