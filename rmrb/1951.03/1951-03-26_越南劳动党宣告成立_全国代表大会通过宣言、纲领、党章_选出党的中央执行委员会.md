Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, North Vietnam: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the National Congress convened to establish the Vietnam Workers' Party was held in a location in North Vietnam from February 11th to 19th. Two hundred delegates attended, including Ho Chi Minh, Truong Chinh, Hoang Quoc Viet, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong were hung in the meeting hall. The Congress unanimously elected Stalin, Mao Zedong, Thorez, Kim Il-sung, as well as the armies of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos as honorary presidium members of the Congress.

Truong Chinh first delivered a political report to the Congress entitled "Complete National Liberation, Develop People's Democracy, and Advance Towards Socialism." This report summarized the experience of the Vietnamese revolutionary movement over the decades and pointed out the future of the Vietnamese people. The Congress discussed Truong Chinh's report. It discussed the issue of building the Party into a strong, pure, and mass-based party, and adopted the declaration, program, and constitution of the Vietnam Workers' Party. President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the constitution would give the Party the necessary strength to "resist to the end and certainly win victory."

The Congress elected the Central Executive Committee of the Party. The General Secretary of the Party, Truong Chinh, received the unanimous trust of the Congress.

The Congress heard reports on the military situation, the national united front, the people's regime, national economic construction, finance, education, ideological struggle, and the patriotic emulation movement.

During the Congress, good news from the Vietnam People's Army on the central front of North Vietnam kept pouring in, repeatedly arousing enthusiastic cheers from the Congress. Vo Nguyen Giap's military report received thunderous applause from the Congress.

President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "This Congress is first and foremost a congress for resistance." He praised the patriotism and heroism displayed by the Vietnam People's Army in the war of liberation. He described the rapid growth of the People's Army, saying: The regular army of the People's Army, now supported by militias and local forces, initially developed from a guerrilla unit of twelve people. This achievement is the result of the guidance of Marxism-Leninism.

The Congress successfully concluded after eight days. Truong Chinh delivered the closing speech, issuing a call to all members of the Vietnam Workers' Party: to transform the resolutions of the Congress into an invincible force of millions of people, and to defeat the French colonialists and American interventionists.

    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社北越消息：为成立越南劳动党而召开的全国代表大会，已于二月十一日到十九日在北越某地举行。出席的有胡志明、长征、黄国越、武元甲等代表二百人。会场中悬有马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志的照片。大会一致选举斯大林、毛泽东、多列士、金日成，以及越南、柬埔寨和老挝的军队为大会的名誉主席团。
    长征首先向大会作了一个题为《完成民族解放、发展人民民主、向社会主义前进”的政治报告。这个报告总结了越南数十年来革命运动的经验，并指出了越南人民的前途。大会讨论了长征的报告。讨论了把党建设为一个强大的纯洁的群众性的党的问题，并通过了越南劳动党的宣言、党纲和党章。胡志明主席指出：党章将给予党以“抗战到底及一定赢得胜利”所必需的力量。
    代表大会选出了党的中央执行委员会，党的总书记长征，受到代表大会的一致信任。
    大会听取了关于军事形势、民族统一阵线、人民政权、国家经济建设、财政、教育、思想斗争和爱国主义竞赛运动等报告。
    大会进行期间，北越中部前线越南人民军的捷报纷纷传来，一再引起大会的热烈欢呼。武元甲的军事报告获得大会雷动的掌声。
    胡志明主席指出：“这次大会首先是抗战大会。”他盛赞越南人民军在解放战争中所表现的爱国主义精神与英雄气概。他叙述人民军的飞跃成长说：现在有着民兵和地方部队支持的人民军正规军，最初是由十二个人的游击队发展起来的。这个成就，是马克思——列宁主义思想指导的结果。
    大会历时八天胜利闭幕。最后由长征致闭幕词，他向越南劳动党全体党员发出号召：要把大会的决议变为千百万人民的不可被战胜的力量，击败法国殖民者和美国干涉者。（附图片）
