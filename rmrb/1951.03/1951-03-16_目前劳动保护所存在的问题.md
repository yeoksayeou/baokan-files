Regarding the existing problems in labor protection

Tang Guifen, Executive Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Since the central Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Textile Workers' Union conducted a key inspection of factory hygiene in Tianjin in February of last year, labor protection in state-owned textile factories in various regions has improved considerably. Some state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin and Qingdao, individual factories in Shanghai, and the Chengtong Textile Factory in Jinan have installed ventilation or air-conditioning equipment in their workshops. State-owned textile factories in Tianjin, Northeast China, Qingdao, Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places have successively established or expanded workers' canteens, enabling workers to eat hot meals. Most state-owned textile factories in Qingdao and Tianjin have provided workers with tea mugs with lids. State-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai have added medical staff, and some medical staff even work shifts in the workshops at night. Trade unions in some factories in Tianjin and Shanghai have also established mutual aid funds, using everyone's money to solve everyone's difficulties. The improvement of working conditions has further enhanced the enthusiasm of employees for production, playing a certain role in ensuring the completion of national production tasks. However, some state-owned textile enterprises still neglect worker safety. For example, on December 2nd of last year, the Shanghai State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 1 assigned Qu Yixing, a new worker who had been in the factory for only fifteen days, to work on cleaning the chimney, resulting in him falling from a height of twenty-four feet, suffering serious injuries, and dying. Similar incidents had occurred three times in the past at this factory, but the administrative department consistently ignored worker safety and never paid attention to it, leading to such a tragedy. Other state-owned factories also have many serious shortcomings in their safety and health work, but the most serious problems exist in private textile enterprises.

A small number of capitalists who do not understand the greater good still only care about making money and disregard the lives and deaths of workers. Private factories generally lack safety devices, and accidents occur constantly in various places. In addition to the Litaiheng incident in Shenyang, Northeast China, an unfortunate incident occurred on May 15th of last year at the Qingdao Huaxin Textile Factory, where a worker, Yue Xirong, was strangled to death by a dyeing machine. On September 25th, the Shanghai Private Zhongfang No. 1 Factory did not pay attention to repairing the safety devices of the hoist ladder, resulting in the steel wire rope on the hoist ladder breaking, and a worker, Chen Dongfu, being crushed to death by the hoist ladder. In the same month, Huang Dingyi, a worker at the Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory, was electrocuted to death while cleaning an electric motor. On October 9th, the Changzhou Xinye Dyeing and Weaving Factory had no safety device on the overpass shaft of the engine, resulting in an unfortunate incident where a female worker, Yang Xiupan, was entangled to death by the shaft. On November 8th, Dai Juqiao, a worker at the Qingdao Yangben Dyeing and Weaving Factory, was splashed with sulfuric acid all over his body and lost sight in his left eye because the rope broke when he was carrying a sulfuric acid jar with a rope. Forty days before this incident, the trade union had suggested to the management to use iron clips to carry sulfuric acid, but the management did not accept it, resulting in the tragedy. The boiler of the Pingyuan Chengxing Yarn Factory has been in use for eighty years and is very dangerous, but it has never been repaired. Flying shuttle injuries are even more common and widespread in various factories. At the Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory, six people were injured in the cloth workshop every day. In Shanghai's eighteen private cotton textile factories alone, there were 2,299 work-related injuries in the thirteen months from August 1949 to August 1950. In Tianjin's Hengyuan, Dongya, and Renli factories, there were twenty-four such injuries in July, August, and September of last year. This alarming number is a serious consequence of private textile factories neglecting safety devices and lacking safety education for employees.

The working conditions of workers in some private textile factories are so poor that they are intolerable. The temperature and humidity are generally very high, and there is no ventilation equipment. In Wuhan last summer, the temperature was as high as one hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit, and many workers fainted at the Wuhan No. 1 Factory every day. In some private textile factories in southern Jiangsu, Changzhou, and Wuxi, the cloth workshops, especially in the alley of the Shenxin No. 3 Factory, are mixed with water and fluff, and the roads are muddy, and people often slip and fall. Some female workers use a piece of wood horizontally and a brick vertically as a pad, and the workers have to wear wooden-soled shoes. In fact, this situation can be solved with a little more management, moderate spraying, no leaks in the pipes, and regular cleaning of the ground, without spending much money. But it is said that because "it has always been like this," there has never been any active improvement. The Changzhou Dacheng Textile Factory stopped supplying water from mid-October, saying that it was because the workers were not thirsty when it was cold, but in fact, the workers were drinking water in groups of three or five with kettles. Generally, there are no spittoons in the workshops of private factories, and the floors of the workshops are covered with sputum. The toilets in the factories are generally few and not clean. The toilets in the factories in Shanxi are smelly and cold. The Lixin Yarn Factory in Wuxi has only one toilet for the six workshops in the front spinning and foreign thread room, and it takes more than three hundred steps to get there. Some private factories in southern Jiangsu do not even have ordinary commode pits, and some still use chamber pots. In some small factories in Shanghai, the toilets are in the workshops, separated from the machines by a piece of cloth. The workshops are small and full of bad smells. The chamber pot of the Huayang Yarn Factory is even set on one side of the dining room, which is extremely unhygienic. The production efficiency of workers at the Shanghai Hengfeng Yarn Factory is quite high, but the workshops are covered with dust, and the ceilings are full of dust-covered webs. The workers complain that the lighting is not enough, but the dust and fluff on the lamps are hanging down for more than a foot, which affects the lighting in the workshop.

In terms of canteens, the dining rooms in some factories in Changzhou are terribly dirty and even let workers eat leftovers. Each time the remaining pot crusts are piled on the table, flies eat them, and then they are given to the workers to eat. In one factory, more than a dozen people fell ill in one day.

In terms of medical care, some small private factories cannot afford the necessary medical and health equipment, and large factories are perfunctory. The Dacheng No. 1 Factory in southern Jiangsu only provides three or four hours of medical treatment a day. The Changzhou Minfeng Yarn Factory has only one nurse for more than 1,500 employees, and a doctor is specially contracted outside the factory, who only comes to the factory for medical treatment for four to six hours a week. The average monthly drug cost per person is only 392 yuan. What medicine can this buy and what disease can it treat? A female worker at the Wuxi Minsheng Yarn Factory died because the factory did not have medical equipment and delayed the time for treatment.

There are many female workers in textile factories, but some private factories do not have nurseries, or even lactation rooms. Female workers in some small factories in Shanghai have to breastfeed in the toilets, and the toilets have become "temporary lactation rooms." Some female workers hide in the gatehouse to breastfeed, and female workers at the Jinan Chengtong Yarn Factory even breastfeed at the factory gate, basking in the sun in summer and eating northwest wind in winter. Among the female workers in Shanghai's twenty-one private factories, 171 had miscarriages, accounting for 5.4% of the 3,154 women who gave birth. But there are even more cruel things. Many silk reeling factories in southern Jiangsu generally employ child labor, with children as young as six or seven years old working twelve hours a day. After deducting the cost of eating biscuits, they only have about 1,600 yuan RMB left, which is completely illegal exploitation of child labor.

The poor working conditions are a serious obstacle to the further improvement of production in these factories. It is entirely possible to gradually improve these working conditions at little or no cost. Some capitalists simply emphasize the difficulties and believe that it is necessary to spend a lot of money to improve labor protection and welfare, saying that it cannot be done at present. Some capitalists only seek to make money and do not make long-term plans, maintaining the old view of valuing machines over people and not paying attention to the safety and health of workers. Some trade union cadres believe that labor protection work cannot be done well in one or two years and has been like this for decades. They do not think the problem is serious, so they ignore this aspect of work.

We believe that doing a good job in labor protection is inseparable from doing a good job in production. If we only require workers to improve in production without improving labor protection and ensuring the safety of employees, then employees will not be able to do a good job in production, production results cannot continue to improve, and it will inevitably cause serious losses to the state and society. At present, labor protection work should do everything possible to improve safety and health equipment, and mobilize the masses to use their brains to gradually improve from the original basis. When sizing the yarn in Qingdao, retaining some humidity can reduce the humidity between the cloth machines, while the work can still be done well. The state-owned Shanghai No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory uses old pipes to sprinkle water on the roof in summer to reduce the temperature in the workshop. These are all good ways to protect labor. We hope that comrades in trade union work will make more such efforts and attach importance to labor protection work.

### 目前劳动保护所存在的问题

　　目前劳动保护所存在的问题
    中华全国总工会执行委员  汤桂芬
    自去年二月中央劳动部、卫生部、纺织工业部和纺织工会等，对天津工厂卫生工作进行了重点检查以后，各地国营纺织工厂中的劳动保护工作已有相当改善。天津、青岛有些国营棉纺织厂，上海个别厂和济南市成通纺织厂等都在车间按装了通风装置或打冷气的装置。天津、东北、青岛、武汉、上海等地纺织厂相继建立或扩大了工人食堂，使工人们能吃到热饭。青岛、天津大部国营纺织厂工人都有了带盖的茶缸。天津、青岛、上海国营棉纺织厂增添了医务人员，有些医务人员夜里还到车间值班。天津、上海部分厂的工会还建立了互助基金的组织，用大家的钱来解决大家的困难。由于劳动条件的改善，就更加提高了职工生产积极性，对保证国家生产任务的完成起了一定的推动作用。但某些国营纺织企业仍然忽视工人安全，如上海国营棉纺织厂机械一厂在去年十二月二日调派进厂十五天的小工瞿义兴担任通烟囱工作，致从二十四尺高处跌下，重伤而死。该厂过去同样事件曾发生过三次，但行政方面一贯忽视工人安全，始终未予重视，致酿成如此惨剧。其他有些国营厂的安全卫生工作，也还存在着许多严重的缺点，但最为严重的却是私营纺织企业。
    少数不明大义的资本家至今仍是只图赚钱，不顾工人死活。一般私营厂普遍缺乏安全装置，各地事故不断发生，除了东北沈阳利泰恒事件外，去年五月十五日青岛华新纺织厂即曾发生工友岳锡荣被染布机绞死的不幸事件。九月二十五日上海私营中纺一厂因为平时不重视修理吊梯的安全装置，吊梯上的钢丝绳折断，工友陈东福被吊梯压死。同月上海申新九厂工友黄鼎彝在清理电机时触电身亡。十月九日常州新业染织厂由于引擎的过桥地轴没有安全装置，发生了工女杨秀盘被地轴缠死的不幸事件。十一月八日青岛阳本染织厂工友戴居桥因用绳子抬硫酸坛，绳子折断，全身被硫酸浸溅，左眼被烧失明。在这一事件发生的前四十天，工会曾向资方提出用铁卡子抬硫酸，资方没有接受以致酿成惨祸。平原成兴纱厂锅炉已使用八十年，十分危险，始终未加修理。各厂飞梭伤人更是经常普遍的事。上海申新九厂布场一天要伤六人，仅仅工伤一项，上海十八个私营棉纺织厂自一九四九年八月到一九五○年八月十三个月中即有二二九九人之多，天津恒源、东亚、仁立三个厂去年七、八、九三个月共有二十四人，这个惊人的数目字正是私营纺织工厂忽视安全装置，对职工缺乏安全教育的严重恶果。
    私营纺织厂车间工人的劳动条件有些更是恶劣到令人难以容忍的地步，温度、湿度普遍很高，没有通风设备。武汉去年夏季更高达一百十几度，武汉第一厂一天就晕倒好多工人。苏南、常州、无锡有些私营纺织厂的布场，特别是申新三厂弄堂上水和花毛混在一起，泥泞满道，常常有人滑倒。有些女工垫得横一块木板竖一块砖头，工人都只好穿上木底鞋子。其实这种情况只要稍稍加强管理，使喷雾适中，管子不漏水，地上常打扫，不要花多少钱就可以解决问题。但是据说因为“一向就这样”，所以也就始终没有积极改进。常州大成纺织厂从十月中旬开始就停止供水，据说是因为天冷了工人不渴，但实际上工人都是三五成群地提着水壶打水喝。各私营厂车间一般都没有痰盂设备，车间地板上到处都是痰。工厂的厕所普遍少而不干净。山西各厂的厕所又臭又冷，无锡丽新纱厂前纺和洋线间六个车间只有一个厕所，远的要走三百多步才能走到。苏南有些私营厂连个普通马桶便坑也没有，还有用便盆的。上海有些小厂厕所就在车间里，所差的只是和机器隔了一块布，车间又小，满屋都是臭味。华阳纱厂便桶甚至设在饭间的一边，极不卫生。上海恒丰纱厂工人的生产效率相当高，但车间的房子却尘土满布，天花板到处都是灰尘结成的网。工人嚷着灯光不够，但灯上的灰尘和花毛结在一起下垂竟有一尺多长，以致影响到车间灯光的不够。
    食堂方面，常州有些厂子的饭间脏的不像样，还让工人吃剩饭，每次剩下的锅巴堆在案子上，蝇子吃过了再拿来工人吃，有个厂一天里就病倒了十几个人。
    医疗方面，必不可少的医药卫生设备，有些私营小厂办不起，大厂也是敷衍了事。苏南大成一厂一天只给看病三、四小时。常州民丰纱厂一千五百余职工只有一个护士，在外面特约了一个医生，每礼拜只到厂看病四至六小时，药费每人每月平均只有三九二元，这能买什么药治什么病？无锡民生纱厂的一个女工就是因为厂里没有医药设备耽误了时间不治而死。
    纺织厂的女工人数很多，但有些私营厂不但没有托儿所，甚至连哺乳室都没有。上海一些小厂的女工就只好到厕所里喂奶，厕所成了“临时哺乳室”。有的厂女工则躲到门房去喂奶，济南成通纱厂的女工甚至还到厂门口喂奶，夏天晒太阳，冬天吃西北风。上海二十一个私营厂女工小产的有一七一人，占产妇三一五四人的百分之五点四。但还有更惨酷的事情，苏南的许多缫丝厂普遍是童工，六、七岁的小孩，每天要作十二小时的工作，而他们一天所得的，除去吃饼外，剩下米只合一千六百元人民币，这完全是非法剥削童工的行为。
    劳动条件的恶劣，是目前这些工厂生产不能进一步提高的严重障碍，在钱花不多或甚至不花钱的条件下来逐步改善这些劳动条件，是完全可能的。有些资方单纯强调困难，认为要搞好劳动保护福利就必须花很多钱，说在目前办不到。有些资方只求赚钱，不做长远打算，保持着过去的只重机器不重人的老观点，没有重视工人的安全和健康。某些工会干部中则认为劳动保护工作不是一、二年内所能办好的，几十年已经如此了，思想上并不以为问题严重，因此，忽视了这方面的工作。
    我们认为搞好劳动保护工作，是和搞好生产分不开的，如果我们只要求工人在生产上提高，而不改进劳动保护工作，不保障职工的安全，那么职工是无法搞好生产的，生产成绩是不可能继续提高的，而且还必然会造成国家社会的严重损失。目前劳动保护工作应尽一切可能来改进安全卫生设备，并且应发动群众，开动脑筋，以便从原有基础上逐步提高。青岛浆纱盘头烘燥时，保留部分湿度，这样布机间的湿度便可减低，而工作则照常好作；国营上海第七棉纺织厂夏天用旧管子装在屋顶上洒水，减少车间温度，都是保护劳动力的好办法，我们希望工会工作同志多作这样的努力，重视劳动保护的工作。
