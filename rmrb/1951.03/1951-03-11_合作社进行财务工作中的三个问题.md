Three Problems in Cooperative Financial Work
       Huang Zhaoxing

Economic accounting is one of the management methods for all enterprises. For cooperatives to implement economic accounting, the correct use of assets is of paramount importance. The correct use of assets constitutes the central link of the cooperative's financial work. Stalin, in his article "New Situation and New Tasks of Economic Construction," stated regarding economic accounting: "In many of our enterprises and economic organizations, the principle of economic accounting has been completely destroyed as a result of wasteful management methods. In fact, many people in many enterprises and economic organizations have long ceased to engage in calculation, valuation, and preparation of accurate balance sheets." Economic accounting is what our current cooperatives need to establish in handling finances. The specific content of cooperative financial work is to engage in the calculation and planning of funds and their correct use, so that both income and expenditure are balanced in quantity and time; at the same time, to save expenses, accelerate capital turnover, and improve reasonable accumulation, so as to promote the normal development of cooperative enterprises. Since March of last year, prices have been basically stable, which has created favorable conditions for financial work. The National Cooperative Conference in July clarified the principle of "cooperatives serve members," and the business had a scope, which provided a basis for finance, and another favorable condition was obtained within the cooperative. This year, the State Bank is implementing currency management and universally promoting cash revenue and expenditure plans. All cooperative federations and some grassroots cooperatives are included in management, which will specifically promote the financial work of cooperatives further. However, all of this has only been happening for the past six months or so. There is little experience, wide scope, a lack of cadres, and urgent demands, which brings many problems. The main problems are three: the understanding of asset inventory, the proportion of capital composition, and the combination of financial plans and business plans.

  I. The Problem of Correctly Understanding Asset Inventory Work

    For cooperatives to implement economic accounting, they must first understand their own assets, clarify property rights relationships and the nature of the source of funds, and prepare conditions for strict accounting. In May of last year, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives investigated the capital property situation of cooperative societies at all levels above the county level across the country. In the reports of 694 cooperatives, it was found that the source of the total amount of 278.8 billion yuan of funds was diverse. Among them were more than 11,900 rooms of houses, nearly 900 acres of land, more than 1,600 pieces of machinery, and more than 1,300 pieces of equipment and materials. The vast majority of property rights were unclear, and trusteeship or lease relationships were also not certain. Funds included state appropriations, local appropriations, undistributed fruits, shares, investments, temporary custody, undistributed surplus, surplus transfers, etc., with complex subjects and inconsistent accounting treatments. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives arranged for cooperative societies at all levels to inventory funds and properties before the end of last year. This work proceeded simultaneously with the promotion of a unified accounting system, in order to enrich accounting content with asset inventory, so that accounting subjects can truly reflect reality; at the same time, to control the inventoried assets with a unified accounting system, consolidate all the assets of the cooperative, and enable the financial situation of nationwide cooperative societies to be uniformly summarized and expressed.

    So far, preliminary reports on the asset inventory work have been made by fifteen units including Pingyuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, Jilin, Songjiang, Anshan, Zhejiang, Subei, Southern Anhui, Shanghai, Gansu, the Central South Cooperative Bureau, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The remaining provinces are also in the process of inventory. One of the initial gains of this stage of inventory work is the discovery of several important problems: First, the length of assets varies. The superior cooperatives in Pingyuan Province had an overdraft of more than 230 million yuan, and losses of funds and goods of more than 930 million yuan. A unit of the Huanggang County Cooperative in Hubei Province discovered extra-accounting property of about 20 million yuan. The Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative's warehouse inventory of 178 kinds of goods found that one-third did not match the accounts. Second, there were accumulated goods and bad debts. The Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative found tung oil, sewing machines, various twill fabrics, brick tea, and some groceries that had been accumulated for more than a year, with a value of more than 550 million yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative had more than 4 million yuan in bad debts. Third, there was serious corruption and waste. Seventy-one people were found to be corrupt in a special zone of Xinxiang. A grassroots cooperative in Qilingzi, Anshan, had transportation expenses of up to 200 million yuan (Northeast currency) in half a year. In addition, there was chaos in accounting, with no accounts found according to documents, no documents found according to accounts, inconsistencies between voucher records and ledger records, and cashiers frequently making credit differences (no income, but expenditure had already occurred). Although the cooperative property has been initially clarified after this inventory, there are still several problems in the understanding of the inventory work: First, many leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the important significance of the asset inventory for understanding their own assets and paving the way for economic accounting. During the inventory, they failed to personally go deep and provide specific leadership, but only a few cadres from the finance and accounting departments "tinkered," and could not concentrate their efforts. Some comrades also have a paralyzing thought about asset inventory, believing that it is troublesome, checking accounts, or finding faults. These tendencies seriously affect the implementation of the inventory work. Second, some cadres did not clearly recognize that asset inventory is only the first step in strengthening financial work. The most important thing is to adhere to the system and maintain the results after the inventory, so that assets are no longer chaotic. For example, Jiahe County, Jilin, had 1.3 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in arrears before the inventory, which was reduced to more than 300 million yuan after the inventory, but it increased to 2 billion yuan soon after because it could not be sustained. The persistence of the system must be maintained by discipline. Protecting people's property, opposing corruption and waste, and strictly implementing the economic accounting system must be achieved through systems and strict discipline. At the beginning of establishing the system, it should be done step by step to prevent the tendency of using money too flexibly, such as "issuing notes to handle affairs at will," "completing tasks without reporting accounts," or "using it first and then talking about it," so that the accounting system cannot be sustained, and the inventoried assets will tend to chaos again.

  II. The Problem of Mastering the Current Ratio of Capital Composition of Cooperatives

    The capital composition of cooperatives mainly has two ratios: one is the ratio of own capital to external capital; the other is the ratio of basic capital to circulating capital. These two ratios need to be appropriate. At present, the sources of cooperative capital are: own capital, such as share capital, membership fees, non-refundable income, surplus accumulation, etc.; government funds, such as national treasury allocations, local allocations, etc.; borrowed funds, such as bank credit, commercial credit, etc. According to the accounting statistics of cooperative units above the provincial and municipal levels in the four major regions of North China, Northeast China, East China, and Central South China at the end of last year, the average own capital accounts for about 22 percent of the total capital, government funds account for about 19 percent, and borrowed funds account for about 59 percent. Government funds plus borrowed funds account for 78 percent, which is about three and a half times the own capital. This ratio is quite appropriate and similar to the ratio of bank loans to cooperatives in the Soviet Union (accounting for 70 to 80 percent). This shows that cooperatives currently have considerable financial strength. However, the development in individual regions is very unbalanced. For example, the own capital in North China accounts for 39 percent of the total capital, 17 percent in the Northeast, 5 percent in East China, and 0.05 percent in Central South China. This imbalance is mainly due to the different times of development. However, in the Northeast, the ratio of own capital of grassroots cooperatives is greater than that of superior cooperatives.

    Another composition of capital is: one is basic capital, which is used for fixed assets such as building houses and equipment, and the other is circulating capital, which is used for direct commodity circulation. These two types of funds must also have a certain appropriate ratio. According to the accounting statistics of 24 units, the average basic capital accounts for 16 percent and the circulating capital accounts for 84 percent. This shows that most of the cooperative's funds are in a circulating state and have sufficient flexibility and turnover capacity. The use of houses, equipment, etc., is necessary for any enterprise, but it is not appropriate to put a large amount of funds in this area before the enterprise's production capacity is consolidated. The appropriate approach should be to use own capital to purchase houses, equipment, etc., which can not only avoid the burden of interest but also prevent it from reducing the ability to turn over funds. In addition to being used for fixed assets such as houses and equipment, own capital must also retain a portion for use as circulating capital. After the bank implements currency management, it stipulates in Beijing that loans to cooperatives shall not exceed 80 percent of the price of goods, and the rest shall be the responsibility of the cooperative itself. This further illustrates the necessity for cooperatives to retain a portion of their own capital as circulating capital. On a national scale, own capital currently accounts for 22 percent of the total capital of cooperatives. The part of own capital used for fixed assets such as houses and equipment accounts for about 73 percent. This ratio is generally sound. However, it varies when viewed separately by region. For example, the fixed assets of some cooperatives in North China account for only 51 percent of own capital, and only 54 percent in the Northeast; conversely, fixed assets in East China exceed own capital by about 6 times, and those in Central South China exceed it by about 240 times. This is also a phenomenon caused by uneven development. In areas with later development, there is no accumulation of their own, and the use of houses, equipment, etc., is already very urgent, so the difference between fixed assets and own capital is huge.

    The ratio of own capital to external capital and the ratio of basic capital to circulating capital of cooperatives are currently relatively normal and sound on a national scale, but there are great imbalances in regional development. In this case, regarding economic accounting in finance, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives can only grasp the unified provisions of the accounting system; as for the accounting standards, they will be temporarily formulated and mastered by the local areas according to the regions. When the implementation of a province or region has achieved effective results, it will gradually improve and gradually concentrate and unify with the development of the business.

  III. The Problem of Combining Financial Plans and Business Plans

    Although the financial plan of the cooperative should be based on the development plan, business plan, labor wage and expense plan, etc., it does not blindly follow. The most important link is how to closely integrate with the business plan.

    It is generally believed that the financial plan should follow the business plan. This understanding is correct when the source of funds is wide and the plan is approved by the government, and the bank can support it. But there are no such conditions at present. At present, the source of funds for cooperatives is limited, and the bank's loans to cooperatives this year are far from the requirements of cooperatives. That is to say, when financial resources are limited, the business must be planned according to the limited financial resources. It can be seen that the financial plan and the business plan are mutually dependent at present, rather than simply one-sidedly who follows whom.

    In order for the financial plan to guarantee and supervise the completion of the business plan, the business plan must be accurate and specific. Its content should not only include the amount of business, but also be specific to the allocation of business time. It is not enough to simply do what business and how much business in the whole year and each quarter. It must be specific to the monthly allocation plan, or even more specific to the first, middle, and last ten days of the month. The balance of fund receipts and payments in time is the basic point of the financial plan. The disconnection of fund use is often not a shortage in quantity, but a failure of turnover at a certain time. If the business plan does not have a relatively detailed and practical time allocation, the financial plan will not be able to grasp it, causing the plan to be out of touch with reality. The so-called guarantee, supervision, and accelerated capital turnover will inevitably fall through.

    It is difficult to master the time allocation of the business plan, which is specific to each month or even every ten days. For example, the promotion of the contract system is not yet universal, and the implementation of the contract has not achieved the due strictness, and the transportation links are often disconnected. The allocation of cadres may not be able to quickly go to work, which will increase some difficulties in the business process. Therefore, the financial plan needs to maintain some flexibility so as not to become a plan for the sake of planning, or be hindered by the plan. In this way, it can provide practical help to the business, and it will not hinder the active conduct of the business due to the constraints of the financial plan. However, it is still necessary to grasp the spirit of striving for rigor and discretionary flexibility, otherwise it will hinder the realization of the plan or make the plan fail. The business and finance departments should jointly understand and grasp this key in formulating the plan.

　　合作社进行财务工作中的三个问题
       黄肇兴
    经济核算制是一切企业的管理方法之一。合作社为要实行经济核算制，对正确利用资财，是头等重要的事。正确利用资财，构成了合作社财务工作的中心环节。斯大林在“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”文中论经济核算制时说：“在我们许多企业和经济组织中，由于用一种浪费办法来经营的结果，经济核算的原则已被破坏无余。事实上，有许多企业和经济组织中的人早已不复从事于计算、估价及拟制正确收支对照表的工作。”经济核算是我们目前合作社在处理财务上所要建立起来的。合作社财务工作具体的内容是从事资金的计算和计划及其正确利用，使收支两方，在数量上和在时间上得到平衡；同时节约开支，加速资金周转，提高合理积累，以促成合作社企业的正常发展。去年三月以后，物价基本稳定，这为财务工作创造了有利条件。七月全国合作会议，明确了“合作社为社员服务”的方针，业务有了范围，使财务有所依据，在合作社内部又获得了一个有利条件。今年国家银行实施货币管理，普遍推行现金收支计划，所有合作社联合社和一部分基层社都列入管理，这更将具体地把合作社的财务工作促进一步。不过，凡此种种，仅仅是大半年来的事，经验少，方面广，干部缺，而要求迫切，这就带来了许多问题。其中主要的问题有三个：对清理资产的认识、资金构成的比例、财务计划与业务计划的结合。
  一、对清理资产工作的正确认识问题
    合作社要实行经济核算制，首先应了解自身家当，明确产权关系和资金的来源性质，为严密核算准备条件。去年五月间全国合作总社调查了全国县以上各级合作社的资金财产情况。在六百九十四个合作社报告中，发现总额二千七百八十八亿元的资金中，来源是多种多样的。其中有房屋一万一千九百余间，地皮近九百亩，机器一千六百余件，设备材料一千三百余件，绝大多数产权不明，托管或租赁关系亦均不肯定。资金中有国家拨款，地方拨款，未分果实，股金，投资，暂时保管，未分盈余，盈余转账等等，科目繁杂，账务处理极不一致。全国合作总社因而在去年年底以前布置了各级合作社清理资金财产的工作。这种工作和推行统一会计制度同时并进，是为了要用清理资产来充实会计内容，使会计科目真能反映实际；同时用统一会计制度来控制已清理的资产，巩固合作社的所有资财，并使全国规模的合作社财务状况能统一汇总表现。
    到目前为止，清理资金财产工作已作初步报告的，有平原、察哈尔、绥远、吉林、松江、鞍山、浙江、苏北、皖南、上海、甘肃、中南合作局、湖南、湖北、江西等十五个单位，其余各省亦均在清理之中。这一阶段清理工作的初步收获之一是发现若干重要问题：首先是资产的长短不一。平原全省上级社长出现款二亿三千余万元，损失款、货九亿三千余万元；湖北黄冈县社一个单位发现账外财产约二千万元，绥远省社仓库盘点一七八种货品发现有三分之一账实不符。其次是积压货品和呆账等。绥远省社发现积压年余的桐油、缝衣机、各色斜纹布、砖茶及一些杂货，价值五亿五千余万元；浙江省社呆账四百余万元。再次是严重的贪污浪费。新乡一个专区查出贪污有七十一人；鞍山七岭子一个基层社曾在半年内开支达二亿元（东北币）的运输费。另外还有会计账务的混乱，按单据找不到账，按账找不到单据，传票记载与账簿记载不符合，现金出纳经常发生贷差（没有收进，已有付出）等现象。合作社财产经过这次清理后，虽然初步澄清了，但在清理工作的认识方面还存在着若干问题：第一、不少领导干部对清理资产的目的在于了解自身家当，为经济核算制铺平道路的重要意义认识不足，在清理当中，未能亲自深入，具体领导，只由财务、会计部门少数干部“零打碎敲”，不能集中力量。又有部分同志对清理资产存在着麻痹思想，认为这是多事、查账或找错。这些倾向都严重地影响了清理工作的贯彻执行。第二、若干干部没有明白认识清理资产仅是加强财务工作的第一步。最重要的还在清理过后，坚持制度保持已获的成果，使资产不再紊乱。如吉林蛟河县在清理前有赊欠十三亿元（东北币），清理后减剩三亿多元，后因不能坚持。不久又增加到二十亿元。至于制度的坚持是要靠纪律来维持的。保护人民财产，反对贪污浪费行为，严格经济核算制度，必须通过制度和严肃纪律方能实现。在建立制度的开始，应该按步就班，要防止用钱过于灵活的偏向，如“随便开条子办事”，“完成任务不报账”，或“先用再说”等，使会计制度不能坚持，已经清理的资产，将再度趋于混乱。
  二、目前合作社资金构成比率的掌握问题
    合作社资金构成，主要有两个比率：一是自有资金与外来资金的比率；一是基本金与流动金的比率。这两个比率需要适当。目前合作社资金来源有：自有资金，如股金，入社费，不返还收入，盈余积累等；政府基金，如国库所拨，地方所拨等；借入资金，如银行信贷，商业信贷等。据去年底华北、东北、华东、中南四大区二十四个省、市以上合作社单位的会计统计，自有资金平均占资金总额约百分之二十二，政府资金约百分之十九，借入资金约百分之五十九。政府基金加借入资金共占百分之七十八，约为自有资金的三倍半。这种比率是相当适当的，和苏联银行贷款给合作社的比率（占百分之七十至八十）也相彷。这说明目前合作社是有相当的资力的。但个别地区的发展则很不平衡，如华北自有资金占资金总额百分之三九，东北百分之十七，华东百分之五，中南百分之点零五。这种不平衡主要是由于发展时间有先后。但东北是基层社自有资金的比率大于上级社。
    资金的另一构成是：一种是基本金，用于房屋建筑，设备等固定资产方面，一种是流动金，用于直接关联商品流通的方面。这两种资金也要有一定的适当的比率。据二十四个单位的会计统计，平均基本金占百分之十六，流动金占百分之八十四。这说明目前合作社的大部分的资金在流动状态，有充分灵活周转的能力。房屋、设备等用途是任何企业所必需，但在企业生产能力没有巩固以前，即将大量资金搁置在这方面，是不恰当的。适当的做法，应该是用自有资金来置备房屋、设备等，既可免除利息的负担，又不致因此减低资金周转的能力。自有资金除用于房屋、设备等固定资产外，至少还要留一部分充作流动金。银行实行货币管理后，在北京对合作社贷款规定不超过商品价款的百分之八十，其余要由合作社自己负责。这样更说明合作社有保留一部分自有资金充作流动金的必要。就全国范围说，目前合作社资金总额中有百分之二十二是自有资金。自有资金中用于房屋、设备等固定资产的部分约占百分之七十三，这样的比率一般地说是稳健的。但以各地区分别来看，则有不同。如华北若干社的固定资产仅占自有资金百分之五十一，东北仅占百分之五十四；反之如华东固定资产则超过自有资金约六倍，中南则超过约二百四十倍。这也是由于发展的不平衡而产生的现象，发展较晚的地区，自身还无积累，而房屋、设备等用途，已很急迫，因而固定资产与自有资金相差悬殊。
    合作社自有资金与外来资金的比率，基本金与流动金的比率，目前以全国范围来说，是相当正常和稳健的，但在地区发展上则存在着很大的不平衡。在这种情况下，关于财务方面的经济核算，在全国合作总社来说，仅能掌握核算制度的统一规定；至于核算的标准，暂先按地区分别由地方掌握拟订，待一省、一区实行已有成效时，再随事业的发展，逐步提高，逐步集中统一。
  三、财务计划与业务计划的结合问题
    合作社的财务计划虽然要依据社务发展计划，业务计划，劳动工薪和费用开支计划等订定，但并不是盲目地跟随。其中最重要的环节在于怎样和业务计划紧密结合。
    一般认为财务计划应跟着业务计划走。在资金来源宽畅，计划经政府核准后，银行即能予以支持的条件下，这种认识是正确的。但目前还没有这样的条件。目前合作社的资金来源是有限的，今年银行对合作社贷款和合作社的要求相差很远。这就是说，在财力有限时，业务就要根据有限的财力去计划，可见财务计划和业务计划在目前是相互依据的，而不是单纯片面的谁跟着谁走。
    财务计划要能对业务计划起保证和监督完成的作用，业务计划就必须确切、具体，其内容不仅有营业数量，还要具体到营业时间的分配。单单全年及每季要做那些业务和多少业务是不够的，必须具体到每月的分配计划，甚或月份中再具体到上、中、下旬。资金收付在时间上的平衡是财务计划的基本要点，资金运用的脱节常常不是数量上的不够，而是在某一时间上的周转不灵。如果业务计划没有比较详细而切实的时间分配，则财务计划就要捉摸不住，造成计划与实际脱节，所谓保证、监督，所谓加速资金周转等等就必然落空。
    业务计划的时间分配，具体到每月甚或每旬，在掌握上是有困难的。如合同制的推行尚未普遍和执行合同中没有做到应有的严格，运输环节时有脱节，干部配备未必能迅赴事功等，都会增加业务进行中的若干困难的，所以，财务计划就有必要保持若干机动性，才不至流于为计划而计划，或是因计划而受到窒碍。这样，才能对业务有切实帮助，才不致因财务计划的约束而妨害业务的积极进行。但是，还必须掌握力求严密、酌情机动的精神，否则会妨碍计划的实现，或是使计划落空。业务和财务工作部门应该共同体会，在订定计划中掌握这一关键。
