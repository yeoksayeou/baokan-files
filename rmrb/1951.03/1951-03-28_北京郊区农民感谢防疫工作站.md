　　Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Thank the Epidemic Prevention Station:
    Editor:
    Since the beginning of spring, more than 50 children in Beiding Village, the 14th district of suburban Beijing, have been infected with measles, and two children have already died. This has made the farmers in the village very uneasy. After the village cadres reported the epidemic to the district government, the People's Government sent comrades from the epidemic prevention station to the village for rescue, and they have now all been cured. The sons of farmers Liu Chunlin and Chen Deyu were in very serious condition, and their parents thought there was no hope of saving them, but they were cured by injections from the comrades at the epidemic prevention station. They said to the village chief: "My son was saved by the People's Government. I really don't know how to thank our government." The masses are very satisfied with the work of the epidemic prevention personnel. Some farmers reflected: "In the past, it was extremely difficult to get an injection. Even if you had money, you couldn't hire a 'foreign doctor'. Now, no matter day or night, they come as soon as you ask."

　　北京郊区农民感谢防疫工作站编辑同志：
    入春以来，北京市郊第十四区北顶村有五十余名儿童感染了瘟疹症（即麻疹），两个小孩子已经死了。这使该村农民非常不安。经该村干部把疫情报告给区政府后，人民政府就派了防疫站的同志来村抢救，现已全部治好了。农民刘春林、陈德钰的儿子，病情十分严重，家长都以为无救了，经防疫站的同志打针治好。他们向村长说：“我的儿子被人民政府救活了，我真不知道怎样感谢咱们的政府。”对于防疫工作人员的工作，群众非常满意，有的农民反映：“过去打一针不知要多么难，‘洋大夫’有钱也请不来，现在不论白天黑夜，一说就来了。”
