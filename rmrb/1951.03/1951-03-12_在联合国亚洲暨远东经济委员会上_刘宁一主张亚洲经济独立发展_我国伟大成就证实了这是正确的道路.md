Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th: Lahore dispatch: Liu Ningyi, head of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation attending the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, delivered a speech on March 2nd during the committee's discussion of a report on industrial and trade issues, proposing suggestions for the independent economic development of Asian countries.

Liu Ningyi stated: We feel that the committee's report on industrial and trade issues does not point out the real reasons for the economic backwardness of Asian and Far Eastern countries, and therefore, the solutions it proposes will certainly not be effective. He pointed out: The real reason for the economic backwardness of Asia and the Far East and the long-term suffering of people living under inhuman living standards is that these countries do not have independent and autonomous economies, but are instead under the control of foreign monopoly capital and the economies of suzerain states.

Liu Ningyi refuted the report's upside-down arguments regarding agricultural technology and other issues. He pointed out: The key to solving this problem is to abolish the feudal exploitation weighing on the vast masses of poor peasants and distribute the land confiscated from landlords without compensation to them. Only in this way can agricultural productivity be liberated and favorable conditions for industrial development be formed. Regarding the issue of industrial development, we would like to point out that without independent national industries, and only promoting the export of raw materials and the import of manufactured goods, the result will only be recession and even economic bankruptcy in these countries.

Liu Ningyi concluded: Establishing an independent and autonomous national economy is the correct way to solve the problem of economic backwardness in this region. This truth has been fully confirmed by the achievements of the People's Republic of China. In just over a year, the People's Republic of China has achieved outstanding and astonishing achievements in industrial construction, soil improvement, irrigation system construction, and improvement of people's living standards. Some reports compiled by the Secretariat have mentioned these achievements of China, but they have not pointed out the main reasons for the achievements, and the information is also very poor. On behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and especially on behalf of the people of Asian countries, I request the committee to carefully consider the opinions and suggestions in the memorandum we have submitted to the Secretariat.

　　在联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会上
    刘宁一主张亚洲经济独立发展
    我国伟大成就证实了这是正确的道路
    【新华社新德里十一日电】拉合尔讯：出席联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会的世界工联代表团团长刘宁一，在该委员会三月二日讨论关于工业和贸易问题的报告时发表演说，提出关于亚洲各国经济独立发展的建议。
    刘宁一称：我们觉得委员会关于工业和贸易问题的报告并未指出亚洲和远东各国经济落后的真正原因，因此，它提出的解决办法当然不会是有效的。他指出：亚洲和远东地区经济落后和人民长期在非人的生活水准下过着痛苦生活的真正原因，是由于这些国家没有独立自主的经济，而相反地处在外国垄断资本和宗主国经济的控制之下。
    刘宁一驳斥了报告中关于农业技术等问题上倒因为果的说法。他指出：解决这个问题的关键，就是取消压在广大贫苦农民群众头上的封建剥削，把无代价地没收的地主的土地分给他们。只有这样做，农业生产力才能解放，工业发展的有利条件才能形成。至于工业发展的问题，我们愿意指出，如果没有独立的民族工业，而仅是促进原料的出口和制造品的入口，结果只会在这些国家造成不景气，甚至要引起经济破产。
    刘宁一最后说：建立独立自主的民族经济，是解决本区经济落后问题的正确办法。这个真理已经由中华人民共和国的成就而完全证实了。在短短的一年多的时间内，中华人民共和国已在工业建设、改良土壤、建设灌溉系统和改善人民生活水准方面，获得了杰出的和惊人的成就。秘书处所编制的某些报告中，曾经提到中国的这些成就，但是并没有指出成就的主要原因，而且其中的资料也是十分贫乏的。我代表世界工会联合会，特别是代表亚洲各国的人民，要求委员会仔细地考虑我们向秘书处所提出的备忘录中的意见和建议。
