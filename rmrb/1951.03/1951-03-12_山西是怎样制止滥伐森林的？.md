How Shanxi Stopped Indiscriminate Logging
      Xiao Ying
    After the liberation of Shanxi in 1949, the province transitioned to a phase of peaceful construction. With the rapid recovery of industry, mining, and transportation, and the improvement of people's lives, the demand for timber surged. Both public and private entities competed to purchase timber at high prices, leading to a supply shortage. Some even ventured deep into the forest regions, buying from mobile vendors and contracting to fell entire mountains. Consequently, the forests in various areas suffered severe damage. From May 1949 to May 1950, a total of 260,000 mu of forest land in the province was indiscriminately logged. In Lingshi alone, the situation escalated to the point where 3,000 people would ascend the mountains daily, felling trees day and night, from the largest to the smallest, leaving only bare mountains behind, not even sparing the flood control forests along the riverbanks.
    Faced with this situation, the province established a Forestry Bureau in October 1949 and implemented a series of emergency measures: requesting transportation departments to halt the transportation of timber; investigating and holding accountable those responsible for the destruction; confiscating a portion or all of the indiscriminately logged timber from speculative merchants; and, when necessary, using armed guards to protect the forests. While these measures halted the large-scale destruction of forests, sporadic incidents of damage continued to occur. To consolidate the protection of the mountains and forests, it was necessary to fundamentally address the issue of timber supply for public and private enterprises, the livelihoods of people in forest areas, and the issue of forest rights.
    The Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau adopted the approach of "unified management of timber, proactively organizing sideline production for people in forest areas, and clarifying forest rights" to resolve these issues.
    Unified management of timber was implemented because timber was a material urgently needed for the recovery and development of industry, mining, and transportation. If various entities simultaneously purchased from the market, it would inevitably stimulate timber price increases, leading to competition for tree felling in pursuit of high profits. This would render the forestry authorities' forest protection efforts ineffective or bring them into conflict with the immediate interests of the people. In response to this situation, Shanxi organized a Timber Company, requiring all enterprises to place orders uniformly with the company, which would then conduct harvesting in a planned manner. In one year, the company proactively supplied over 18,000 cubic meters of timber to industrial, mining, and transportation departments, and transported over 28,000 cubic meters of timber to areas along the Datong-Puzhou Railway. The company also controlled timber prices. Furthermore, the company cleared indiscriminately logged forest areas, creating favorable conditions for forest regeneration, gradually guiding Shanxi's timber harvesting work onto a scientific path, meeting the needs of construction while nurturing the forests.
    The Timber Company not only solved the timber supply problem but also addressed the livelihoods of some residents in forest areas. In one year, the company spent over 10.4 million catties of millet and 500,000 catties of sorghum on wages for logging, transportation, and clearing forest areas. This substantial investment improved the living standards of residents in forest areas, leading to a significant increase in the sales volume of cloth in local markets. Consequently, residents in forest areas personally experienced the benefits of forests. For example, after halting indiscriminate logging in Lingshi, the Forestry Bureau carried out thinning and nurturing work. Residents in forest areas commented that only such felling could ensure long-term reliance on the mountains, whereas indiscriminate felling would leave the mountains bare in two years, leaving them with nothing to live on! They spontaneously rose up to protect the forests and prevent illegal logging.
    In other forest areas where logging work had not yet begun or was not suitable, the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau proactively organized the masses to engage in mountain and forest sideline production, promoting the idea of "relying on the mountains to eat, but also nurturing the mountains," encouraging mountain residents to make long-term plans. Based on residents' original habits, the bureau organized them into various mountain and forest sideline production groups, enabling residents to derive income from the forests without destroying them. This increased the masses' enthusiasm for protecting forests, enabling the development of forest protection work. More than 2,000 villages across the province have established forestry committees. Those who lead residents in mountain and forest sideline production through the leadership of forestry committees can effectively carry out forest protection and nurturing work. For example, the Forestry Committee of Gaojiazhuang in Heshun County divided the village's mountains and forests into many responsibility areas, with dedicated personnel responsible for management, preventing theft and fires, and constantly educating the masses to cherish the forests. Last year, when the county requisitioned electric poles, the Gaojiazhuang Forestry Committee ensured that felling was carried out in a planned manner based on the density of the forests and the specifications of the materials, through democratic discussion.
    When Shanxi launched forest protection work, hidden special agents and lawless landlords took the opportunity to spread rumors, inciting forest owners to destroy the forests. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Forest Management" last August, and various regions followed suit by launching work to determine forest rights, measuring areas, burying boundary markers, and issuing mountain and forest ownership certificates. As a result, private forests received legal protection. This exposed the unfounded rumors of special agents, bandits, and lawless landlords, and encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation.
    Shanxi's resolution of the above three issues has led to significant achievements in forest protection work, laying a favorable foundation for afforestation work. Residents of Jingzi Village in Heshun County, through forest protection work, recognized the benefits of forests and realized that clearing mountain wasteland was not cost-effective, spontaneously launching "returning farmland to forest" and "closing hillsides for afforestation" initiatives.

### 山西是怎样制止滥伐森林的？

　　山西是怎样制止滥伐森林的？
      萧颖
    一九四九年山西全境解放后，转入了和平建设的局面。由于工矿交通事业的迅速恢复和人民生活的改善，木材的需要骤增，公私单位争相高价收购，市场供不应求。有的单位更深入林区，流动收买，包山砍伐。因此各地森林遭到严重的破坏。自一九四九年五月，到一九五○年五月，全省被滥伐的森林达二十六万亩。灵石一地，曾发展到每日三千人上山，日夜砍伐，由大到小，树尽山留，连沿河地带的防洪林都未能幸免。
    在这种情况下，该省于一九四九年十月成立林业局，并采取了一连串的紧急措施：函请交通部门停运木材；追究破坏责任；没收投机商人滥伐木材的一部门或全部；必要时更以武装护林。这些办法虽然停止了森林的大规模破坏，但零星破坏事件仍不断发生。为巩固对山林的保护，就必须从根本上解决公私企业建设用材的供应问题，林区群众的生活问题，和林权问题。
    山西省林业局对这些问题，是采取“统一经营木材，主动组织林区群众副业生产，和确定林权”的办法来解决的。
    统一经营木材，是因为木材是工矿交通事业恢复与发展所急需的材料，各单位如同时在市场收购，势必刺激木价上涨，仍会因谋高利而竞相伐树，以致林业机关的护林工作变成形式，或与群众的眼前利益冲突。针对这一情况，山西省遂组织木材公司，让各企业单位统一向公司订购，然后由公司有计划地进行采伐。一年来该公司主动地供给了工矿交通部门木材一万八千多立方米，运至同蒲路沿线木材二万八千多立方米。并掌握了木材价格。该公司又清理了滥伐的林场，给森林的更新造成了有利条件，使山西木材采伐工作逐步走上科学的道路，既满足了建设事业的要求，又抚育了森林。
    木材公司不但解决了木材供应问题，也解决了林区部分群众的生活问题，该公司在一年中，开支了采伐、搬运和清理林场等项工资小米达一千零四十余万斤，高粱五十万斤。这一巨额的投资，使林区居民生活得到改善，使当地市场布匹销售量显著增加。这样一来，林区居民亲身体验了森林对自己的利益。像灵石制止滥伐后，林业局进行了间伐抚育工作。林区居民反映，这样伐树才能长远靠山吃山，像过去大家乱砍，二年山就光了，我们还吃什么！就自动起来护林，制止偷伐。
    山西省林业局另外又在尚未开展采伐工作或不宜采伐的林区，主动去组织群众搞山林副业生产，宣传靠山吃山要养山的思想，使山区居民作长远打算。并根据居民原有的习惯，组织他们成立各种山林副业生产小组，使居民在不破坏森林的条件下，依然能从森林获得收益。这样提高了群众爱护森林的情绪。使护林工作得到开展，全省已有两千多个村成立了林业委员会，凡通过林业委员会领导居民进行山林副业生产的，都能很好地开展护林养林工作。如和顺县郜家庄的林业委员会，把全村山林分成许多责任区，专人负责管理，防止偷盗和火灾，并经常向群众宣传要爱护森林。该县去年征购电杆，郜家庄林业委员会就做到根据山林的密度，及材料的规格，民主讨论有计划的采伐。
    山西在展开护林工作时，暗藏的特务分子和不法地主曾乘机造谣，引起了林主的破坏。山西省人民政府于去年八月即公布森林管理暂行条例，各地区跟着即展开确定林权工作，测量面积，埋置界标，颁发山林所有证。因而私人山林得到了法律的保障。这样就揭破了特务匪徒、不法地主的无稽谣言，鼓励了群众造林的情绪。
    山西解决了以上三个问题，使护林工作得到显著的成绩。又给造林工作打下了有利的基础。该省和顺县井子村居民，通过护林工作，认识到森林的好处，觉得开山荒不合算，就自动开展“停耕还林”、“封山育林”的工作。
