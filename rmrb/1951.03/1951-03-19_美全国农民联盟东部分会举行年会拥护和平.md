Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 12th: According to a telecommunications report, the Eastern Branch of the US National Farmers Union recently held its eighth annual meeting, with peace as the central theme.

　　For several months, the Eastern Branch has steadfastly opposed the Korean War, despite this opposition being consistently denounced as "subversive" activity. According to the annual meeting report, the branch's membership has increased by fifteen percent in the past year. The branch's Executive Secretary, Slocum, pointed out that this is the result of implementing a policy of peace. Slocum said: "Under a war economy, family farms are facing disaster. Conscripting farm youth and the currently proposed method of conscripting eighteen-year-olds will greatly destroy family farms." Iowa Farmers Union Chairman Stouffer also said at the annual meeting: "Our membership is increasing because we advocate for peace. The people in small towns all support the peace movement."

　　美全国农民联盟东部分会举行年会拥护和平
    【新华社十六日讯】据电通社纽约十二日讯：美国全国农民联盟的东部分会最近举行第八届年会，会议的中心议题是和平。
    几个月以来，东部分会始终不渝地反对朝鲜战争，而不顾这种反对一直被诬蔑为“颠覆”行为。据年会报告，分会会员人数一年来增加了百分之十五。分会执行书记斯洛坎指出，这是执行和平政策的结果。斯洛坎说：“在战争经济下，家庭农场正面临灾难。征召农场青年入伍和现在拟议中的征召十八岁青年的办法，将大大摧毁家庭农场。”衣阿华州农民联盟主席史图佛也在年会上说：“我们的会员人数正在增加，因为我们主张和平。小城镇的人民都拥护和平运动。”
