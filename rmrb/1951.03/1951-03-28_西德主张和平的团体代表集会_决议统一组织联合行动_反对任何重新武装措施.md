　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A conference of representatives from thirty-five West German peace groups, including pacifist, social democratic, and bourgeois groups and organizations, totaling one hundred and thirty people, was held in Frankfurt on the 17th and 18th. The conference decided to unify their organizations into a single group to take concerted action against the remilitarization of West Germany.

　　Shen Ke (Hamburg) gave a report to the conference opposing Adenauer and Schumacher's assertion that peace would be guaranteed by German rearmament and remilitarization. When Shen Ke said, "Rearmament inevitably leads to war," the conference responded with warm applause.

　　Ke He (Hamburg) told the conference that public opinion polls showed that an average of 82 percent of West Germans opposed remilitarization. The vast majority of those surveyed advocated an immediate popular vote on the issue of remilitarization.

　　German Rights Party Chairman Osto spoke, vehemently opposing the war preparations underway in West Germany. He pointed out that remilitarization would lead to Germany's destruction in a Third World War.

　　The conference elected a council of thirty-four members to guide the work of the group. The council plans to convene the second conference of those advocating German neutrality in West Germany within the next three months. The conference also decided to issue an appeal to the people of West Germany, calling on all those who hate war to rise up against all types of measures that would remilitarize West Germany.

　　西德主张和平的团体代表集会
    决议统一组织联合行动
    反对任何重新武装措施
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西德三十五个主张和平的团体，包括和平主义者、社会民主党和资产阶级的团体和组织的代表一百三十人，于十七、十八两日在法兰克福举行大会，决定将他们的组织统一成为一个单一的集团，以采取联合一致的行动，反对西德重新军国主义化。
    沈克（汉堡）向大会作报告，反对阿登纳与舒马赫所谓和平将因德国重新武装与重新军国主义化而得到保障的说法。当沈克说到“重新武装必然导向战争”时，大会报以热烈的掌声。
    科黑（汉堡）告诉大会说：民意测验表明：西德人民平均有百分之八十二反对重新军国主义化。被征求意见的人，绝大多数都主张立即就重新军国主义化问题举行人民投票。
    德国权利党主席奥斯托发言，猛烈反对正在西德进行的战争准备。他指出，重新军国主义化将使德国在第三次大战中遭到毁灭。
    大会选出了一个由三十四人组成的理事会，负责指导该集团的工作。理事会计划在今后三个月内，在西德召开主张德国中立的人士的第二届代表大会。大会并决定向西德人民发出呼吁，号召一切憎恨战争的人们起来反对一切类型的使西德重新军国主义化的措施。
