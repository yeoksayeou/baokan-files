　　Introduction to the Leipzig Fair
    China Participates for the First Time with Goods and Pictures
    He Jiang
    This year's Leipzig Spring International Fair will be held from March 4th to 11th. New China is participating in the fair for the first time with goods and pictures. This is widely regarded as an important feature of this year's Leipzig Fair. In addition, 1951 is the year when the German Democratic Republic begins its five-year plan after the successful completion of its two-year plan. Therefore, this fair does have its special significance compared to the past.
    Let me first briefly introduce the history of the Leipzig International Fair. Leipzig is located southwest of Berlin, and it has long been one of the world's academic and publishing centers. The term "fair" (die Messe in German, Ярма Рка in Russian, and Fair in English) is equivalent to the Chinese "market" or "temple fair." International fairs gradually took shape from the 12th to the 14th centuries. From the end of the 15th century, Leipzig became the commercial center of Eastern Europe. Eastern and Southeastern Europe exchanged so-called East Indian and West Indian goods through the Leipzig market. By the 18th century, due to its convenient location, the Leipzig International Fair had surpassed other fairs around the world and became the first. Until World War II, the Leipzig Fair maintained its position as the world's largest international fair in terms of the number of participating countries and the number of exhibits. After the war, it remains the largest international fair in Europe.
    According to the usual practice, the Leipzig International Fair holds sample and technical fairs in the spring, and only sample fairs in the autumn. The sample fair is held in fourteen tall exhibition halls in the city of Leipzig, divided into twenty-one departments. The technical fair is held in eleven concentrated exhibition halls in the suburbs. Consumer goods usually participate in the sample fair; industrial equipment, production equipment and other technical products participate in the technical fair.
    Due to the changing times and the changing composition of participants, the significance of the Leipzig Fair is now not only international business, but also political. In addition to promoting international trade, it is also a great exhibition of the unparalleled power of the peaceful economy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The largest pavilion in the Leipzig suburb technical fair area - Pavilion 5 - is dedicated to the Soviet exhibition. Pavilion 10 is dedicated to the exhibition of China and other people's democratic countries. In addition to the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, some enterprises in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria also participated in the fair separately.
    The Soviet exhibition area covers 16,000 square meters and is the largest exhibition unit. The scope of exhibits covers the products of various light and heavy industrial sectors of the Soviet republics, including various types of cars, various types of tractors, various types of machine tools for the machinery manufacturing industry, and various excellent consumer goods, as well as models of the Moscow subway trains, etc. This shows the glorious achievements of Soviet communist construction and the unity of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union in friendship and politics.
    This year, China is participating in the fair for the first time with more than 3,000 kinds of goods and hundreds of pictures. The goods include China's export goods and various products that show the achievements of New China's economic construction, such as petroleum and metallurgical industry products (including tungsten and antimony, etc.), fuels, building materials, oils and fats, cotton yarn, cloth, fur, silk and silk products, hog bristles and other specialties, as well as rice, egg products, salt, tea, and works of art. According to the materials distributed by the press office of the Leipzig Fair Administration, a 20-meter-high model of Tiananmen Square in Beijing will be set up on the front of the Chinese exhibition area. On both sides of the center of the venue, there will be two to four giant walls made of glass夹成大豆, tea, rice and peanuts. The display is magnificent and shows the unlimited economic potential of the great People's China. The pictures participating in the exhibition include various photos, charts and other paintings illustrating the political and economic development, production and resource conditions of New China.
    Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania each hold large-scale comprehensive exhibitions in Pavilion 10 of the Technical Fair Area, displaying the special products, light and heavy industrial products, agricultural products, and mineral products of each country.
    In addition to participating in the sample fair by category, the German Democratic Republic also holds a comprehensive exhibition in the entire Pavilion 2 of the Technical Fair Area. The achievements of the peaceful economic construction of Democratic Germany and the prospects for the future will be explained here.
    In addition, forty-four publishing companies in the United Kingdom will participate in the sample fair of books. French literary books and various famous wines, and food industry products from Denmark and the Netherlands are also on display.
    A total of 8,400 units are participating in this fair. The fairground covers a total area of 145,000 square meters. As usual, participating units will receive a large number of orders during the fair.
    At the same time, two fashion exhibitions will be held in Leipzig between March 5th and 11th.
    Last year, 1.5 million people came from all over to visit the fair. This year, it is estimated that as many as two million people will come from afar to visit.

　　莱比锡博览会介绍
    我国以货品、图片首次参加博览
    何疆
    今年的莱比锡春季国际博览会于三月四日到十一日举行。新中国破天荒第一次以货品及图片参加博览。这一点被普遍认为是本届莱比锡博览会的重要特点。此外，一九五一年是德意志民主共和国在二年计划胜利完成之后开始实行五年计划的一年。所以，这次博览会比起以往来确实有其特殊的意义。
    这里先附带简单介绍一下莱比锡国际博览会的历史沿革。莱比锡在柏林西南，它很早以来就是世界的学术与出版业中心城市之一。博览会按其原文（德文是die Messe，俄文译为Ярма　Рка，英文译为Fair）来讲，等于中国的市集或庙会。国际性的博览会在十二世纪至十四世纪渐渐形成。从十五世纪末叶起，莱比锡就成为东欧的商业中心。东欧和东南欧各地都要通过莱比锡的市场来交换当时所谓东印度和西印度的商品。到十八世纪时，由于地点适中，莱比锡国际博览会已经凌驾世界其他各地的博览会而跃居第一位。直到第二次世界大战之前，就其参加国家的数目以及陈列品的数目而言，莱比锡博览会一直保持着世界最大国际博览会的地位。大战以后它仍然是欧洲最大的国际博览会。
    按照往例，莱比锡国际博览会，每年春季举行样品和技术博览，秋季只举行样品博览。样品博览在莱比锡城内十四个高大的博览馆分二十一个部门举行。技术博览则在近郊十一个集中的博览馆举行。消费品通常参加样品博览；工业设备，生产器材及其他技术品则参加技术博览。
    由于时代不同，由于参加者成份的改变，现在莱比锡博览会的意义就不仅是国际商务上的，而且还具有政治的意义。它除了促进国际贸易之外，同时还是苏联和人民民主国家的和平经济无比威力的大展览。莱比锡市郊技术博览区内最大一个博览馆——第五馆专供苏联博览。第十馆专供中国及其他各人民民主国家博览。除了苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国和西德之外，还有英国、法国、意大利、荷兰、丹麦、比利时、瑞士和奥地利等国的某些企业各别地参加博览。
    苏联博览会场占地一万六千平方米，是最大的博览单位。博览品范围及于苏联各加盟共和国轻重工业各部门的产品，包括各式汽车，各式拖拉机，机器制造业的各式工作机和各种出色的消费品，还有莫斯科市地下铁道列车模型等等。这里表现出苏联共产主义建设的辉煌成就，并表现出苏联各族人民在情谊上及政治上的团结。
    中国今年有货品三千余种与图片数百幅首次参加博览。货品里包括中国的出口货品以及足以显示新中国经济建设成就的各种制品，诸如石油及冶金业产品（包括钨及锑等等）、燃料、建筑器材、油脂品、棉纱、布匹、皮毛、丝及丝制品、猪鬃等各种特产及米、蛋制品、盐、茶等，还有艺术品。根据莱比锡博览会管理局新闻处所散发的材料，中国博览会场内的正面将布置一座高达二十米的北京天安门模型。会场中间的两侧将矗立两座到四座用玻璃夹成的大豆、茶、米和花生的巨墙。陈设富丽宏伟，显示伟大的人民中国的无限的经济潜力。参加陈列的图片中包括了说明新中国政治及经济发展以及生产与资源状况的各种照片、图表和其他画片。
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚及阿尔巴尼亚在技术博览区第十馆各举行大规模的综合博览，陈列各国的特产，轻重工业产品、农产品、矿产品等。
    除了分类参加样品博览外，德意志民主共和国还在技术博览区第二馆全馆举行综合博览。民主德国和平经济建设已有的成绩以及今后的前景将在这里获得说明。
    除此之外，英国的四十四家出版公司将参加书籍的样品博览。法国的文艺书籍和各种名酒，丹麦和荷兰的食品工业产品等等也在博览之列。
    这次博览的参加单位总共有八千四百个。博览会场占地共十四万五千平方米。照例，博览期间各参加单位都会收到大批定货。
    与此同时，三月五日到十一日之间，莱比锡将举行两次时装展览。
    去年有一百五十万人从各地赶来参观博览。今年人们估计，远道前来参观者将达两百万。
