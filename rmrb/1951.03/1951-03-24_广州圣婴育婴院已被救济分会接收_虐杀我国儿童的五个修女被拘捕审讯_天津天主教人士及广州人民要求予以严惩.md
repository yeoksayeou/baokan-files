Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 23rd. The Holy Infant Nursery in Guangzhou, run by the Canadian Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, has been taken over by the Guangzhou branch of the China People's Relief Association. The former director of the nursery, Pan Yafang, the deputy director, Gao Zhongchen, and staff members Lian Dewang, Tang Yaqin, and Lü Xinde, five Canadian nuns who abused and killed Chinese children, have been arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at the unanimous request of the city's people and sent to the Guangzhou People's Court for handling. They are currently under interrogation.

According to statistics, the nursery admitted a total of 2,216 infants from January 1950 to mid-February this year. On March 5th, when the Guangzhou branch of the China People's Relief Association took over, only 48 female infants under the age of two remained (the nursery did not accept male infants); 29 of them were ill. In just over a year, a total of 2,168 infants died, a mortality rate of 97.8%. The nursery has been open for 18 years, and it is now impossible to calculate how many children have died in these 18 years. According to the confession of the culprit, the former director of the nursery, Pan Yafang, more than 4,000 infants have died in the past two years alone. According to the local public security bureau's materials on birth and death registration, the nursery admitted six infants one day and reported the deaths of six infants the next day. On another occasion, ten were admitted and ten died. The nursery stipulated that parents must fill out a "no responsibility for life or death" agreement when sending infants to the nursery. After the infants were admitted, they were first placed in the basement; after a day and a half, if they had not yet died, they were sent for baptism; those who had already died were thrown into a specially designated "dead baby well." The "dead baby well" was about thirty feet deep and five feet wide, with a wooden lid on the well opening. The nursery dug three wells last year; two of them had already been filled after being piled with children's corpses, and the one that was still open was now piled with infant corpses wrapped in small sacks, arranged horizontally and vertically in layers. In the past, many mothers who visited their children at the nursery found that their children had died for some unknown reason, and they were filled with grief and indignation. The nuns deceived them by saying, "This is the will of God." The nuns deceived the older girls in the nursery by saying, "We are all 'sinners'; we must 'endure hardship' while alive, and those who have died have gone to 'happy heaven'!"

After the Guangzhou branch of the China People's Relief Association took over the nursery, doctors examined the surviving infants and found that their faces were covered with red mosquito bites, and the muscles on their buttocks were red and rotten in eight or nine cases out of ten. The older children were covered in lice. The majority of the 29 sick infants suffered from pneumonia. The nursery had only one set of bottles and nipples for feeding. Many children used them in rotation, causing the spread of disease. The deputy director of the nursery, Gao Zhongchen, was originally a caregiver, but the nursery had her serve as a doctor. When she treated the children, she diagnosed and prescribed medicine haphazardly, and many infants were killed by her medical treatment.

The Holy Infant Nursery engaged in fraud in the name of "charity." Many parents had to pay "food expenses" and "handling fees" when sending their children to the nursery. The nursery also solicited donations from Guangzhou businesses and the people of Canada. The heavy labor in the nursery was done by the older children, such as washing clothes, growing vegetables, raising pigs, and caring for the younger infants. These children were cruelly abused by the nuns. They were often forced to line up and prostrate themselves on the ground to be beaten by the "girls" (Canadian nuns). Chen Luxi, 23, said that a three-year-old child named "Fang Xuan" was beaten to death by the nuns.

After the Guangzhou branch of the China People's Relief Association took over the nursery, it sent doctors and nurses to work in the nursery. The living and sanitary conditions of the infants have been improved. The sick infants have received medical treatment. Since March 10th, the deaths of children have stopped occurring.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 23rd. Catholics in Tianjin have expressed extreme indignation at the crimes of Guangzhou's "Holy Infant Nursery" and Nanjing's "Loving Infant Nursery," etc., in harming Chinese children, and have demanded that the government severely punish the murderers.

Zhao Zhenya, Deputy Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese of the Catholic Church, said: We Catholic parishioners should promote the sacred cause of the church based on the spirit of love. However, these "nuns" have created such a great tragedy. From a religious standpoint, I cannot tolerate such crimes. I hope the People's Government will give the responsible persons of each hospital the punishment they deserve to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents. Wu Kezhai, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Catholic Renewal Movement Promotion Association, and committee members Nie Guoping, Li Depei, and others, priests of the Catholic Jizhuangzi Church, unanimously pointed out that the crimes of imperialists in Nanjing and Guangzhou in harming Chinese children exposed the essence of imperialism in using religion and engaging in aggression in the name of "charity" and "relief." These cruel acts are an insult to Catholicism. They demanded that the government severely punish the murderers. In addition, teachers and students from Hebei Provincial Medical College, Tianjin Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School, No. 2 Girls' Middle School, and the attached middle school of Jingu University also unanimously demanded that the government severely punish the murderers.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 23rd. People from all walks of life in Guangzhou have expressed boundless anger at the evil deeds of the Holy Infant Nursery, run by the Canadian Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, in abusing and killing Chinese infants, and demanded that the government severely punish the murderers. Representatives from more than 80 units, including the city's health, cultural, and educational organs, people's organizations, religious circles, schools, and child care institutions, held a symposium on March 16th. After hearing the report on the takeover of the Holy Infant Nursery by Zhuo Xuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Guangzhou Branch of the China People's Relief Association, the representatives unanimously stated that such a serious and evil incident could not be tolerated; the criminals must be severely punished. Xiong Zhenpei, a representative of the Guangzhou church group, said: "The administrators of the Holy Infant Nursery have adopted an extremely cruel and extremely careless attitude towards the lives of Chinese children, resulting in an infant mortality rate of more than 90 percent. These murderers who harm infants must be punished according to law." Representatives from groups such as the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, and the Women Workers' Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions all made speeches demanding the punishment of the murderers.

Many readers' letters published in the "Southern Daily" and "United Daily" unanimously demanded that the government severely punish the murderers. Many relatives of the victimized infants have demanded revenge and redress for the thousands of unfortunate infants and unfortunate parents!

　　广州圣婴育婴院已被救济分会接收
    虐杀我国儿童的五个修女被拘捕审讯
    天津天主教人士及广州人民要求予以严惩
    【新华社广州二十三日电】加拿大无原罪女修会在广州举办的圣婴育婴院已由中国人民救济总会广州分会接办。该院前院长潘雅芳、副院长高忠臣，职员连德望、唐雅琴、吕信德五个虐杀中国儿童的加拿大修女，在全市人民的一致要求下，已由广州市公安局拘捕，送交广州市人民法院法办，现正审讯中。
    据统计，该院自一九五○年一月至今年二月中旬，共收容婴儿二千二百一十六名。三月五日中国人民救济总会广州分会接办时，仅存二岁以下的女婴（该院不收男婴）四十八名；其中患病的占二十九名。一年多来，共死亡婴儿二千一百六十八名，死亡率达百分之九十七·八。该院开设已经十八年，在这十八年中究竟死了多少孩子，现已无法统计。仅据凶犯该院前院长潘雅芳供认：近两年来死亡婴儿就有四千多名。据当地公安分局关于出生、死亡登记的材料，该院有一天收容六个婴孩，第二天便报死亡婴孩六名。又一次收十名，死十名。该院规定：家长送婴孩入院时，必须填具“生死不负责任”的切结。婴孩入院后先被放在地下室里；过一天半天以后，如还没有死，才被送去洗礼；已死的就投在特设的“死仔井”里。“死仔井”深约三丈，阔五尺，井口装有木盖。该院在去年共掘了三个井；其中两个已经在堆满孩尸后被填塞，还开着的一个里面现在也已纵横层叠地堆着用小麻袋裹着的婴尸。过去许多母亲们到该院探望孩子时，都发现她们的孩子不知怎么就死掉了，悲愤万分。修女们欺骗她们说：“这是上帝的意旨。”修女们欺骗院里年龄稍大的女孩说：“我们都是有‘罪’的；活着就要‘刻苦’，那些死掉的都已到了‘快乐的天堂’！”
    中国人民救济总会广州分会接办该院后，经医生检查，活着的婴孩脸上都是蚊虫咬的红点，屁股上的肌肉十之八九都红烂，较大的孩子满身都生了虱子。二十九名生病的婴孩中，绝大部分是患肺炎。该院喂奶用的奶瓶和奶嘴就只有一套。许多孩子轮流使用，致疾病蔓延。该院副院长高忠臣本来是一个看护，但该院却以她担任医生。她替小孩看病时，胡乱诊断、用药，许多婴孩被她医死。
    圣婴育婴院借“慈善”之名进行骗财。许多家长送小孩入院时要交“伙食费”、“手续费”等。该院并向广州商号和加拿大人民募捐。院内繁重的劳动都由年龄稍大的小孩做，如洗衣、种菜、养猪和看护幼婴等工作都由她们担任。这些小孩受着修女们残酷的虐待。她们常被强迫排成队，俯伏地上，遭受“姑娘”（加拿大修女）殴打。二十三岁的陈露西说：有一个三岁的名叫“芳宣”的小孩就是被修女毒打致死的。
    中国人民救济总会广州分会接办该院后，即派出医生、护士驻院工作。婴孩们的生活和卫生情况已经改善。患病的幼婴已经得到医疗。自三月十日起孩子们的死亡现象已停止发生。
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津天主教人士对广州“圣婴育婴院”及南京“慈爱育婴院”等残害中国儿童的罪行，表示极端愤慨，纷纷要求政府严惩凶手。
    天主教天津教区副主教赵振亚说：我们天主教教友应本博爱的精神推行圣教事业。然而这些“修女”却制造了这样大的惨剧。我站在宗教的立场，不能容忍这种罪行。我希望人民政府对各该院的负责人给予应得的惩罚，以免类似事件的重演。天主教革新运动促进会筹备会主任委员吴克斋及委员聂国屏、天主教纪庄子教堂神甫李德培等一致指出：帝国主义者在南京广州残害中国儿童的罪行，暴露了帝国主义利用宗教，假借“慈善”、“救济”等名义进行侵略的本质。这些残忍行为是对天主教的污辱。他们要求政府严惩凶手。此外，河北省立医学院、天津市立第一女子中学、第二女子中学、津沽大学附属中学等校师生也一致要求政府严惩凶手。
    【新华社广州二十三日电】广州市各界人民对加拿大无原罪女修会举办的圣婴育婴院虐杀中国婴孩的罪恶行为表示无限愤怒，要求政府严惩凶手。该市卫生、文教机关、人民团体、宗教界、学校、儿童保育机关等八十余单位的代表于三月十六日举行座谈会。与会代表听了中国人民救济总会广州分会副秘书长卓璇的接办圣婴育婴院经过的报告后。一致表示对这种严重罪恶事件不能容忍；凶犯必须严惩。广州市教会团体代表熊真沛说：“圣婴育婴院管理人对中国儿童的生命采取极端残忍和极端轻率的态度，致使婴儿死亡率达百分之九十以上。这些残害婴儿的凶手必须依法惩处。”广东省民主妇女联合会、广州市民主妇女联合会、广州市总工会女工部等团体代表都发表谈话，要求惩办凶手。
    “南方日报”、“联合报”发表的许多读者的信中，一致要求政府严惩凶手。许多被害婴儿的亲属都要求为万千不幸的婴儿、不幸的父母们报仇雪冤！
