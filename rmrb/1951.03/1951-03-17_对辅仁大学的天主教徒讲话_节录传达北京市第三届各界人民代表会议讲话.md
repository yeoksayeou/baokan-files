　　Speech to Catholic Students and Faculty at Fu Jen Catholic University
　　-- Excerpts from the Speech at the Third Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress
　　Chen Yuan

　　We have finished conveying the spirit of the Third Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. Taking this opportunity, I would like to say a few words to our Catholic students and faculty at Fu Jen. In Comrade Peng Zhen's report, the political aspect particularly emphasizes the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Our school has put in considerable effort in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and we should continue to work hard in the future. As for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we have not done enough. We have discovered several remaining secret agents in our school, but they were all discovered by the public security departments, not by our school's own reporting. In the future, we must be especially careful, especially vigilant, and especially alert.

　　Our Fu Jen was originally a church school. Among the faculty, staff, and students, there are many Catholics, especially among the students, there are more than seventy Chinese priests. If this force is added to the patriotic movement, it can play a significant role. However, the "Declaration of Independence and Reform Movement of Catholics in Beijing" has not yet been issued, which is a disgrace to the Catholics in Beijing. Since our Fu Jen possesses a group of intellectual Catholics and more than seventy Chinese priests as students, we must take some responsibility. There must be resistance in the middle as to why this declaration has been delayed. Where is the resistance? It is because behind them there are imperialist elements holding, manipulating, spreading rumors, and intimidating, saying things like "Catholicism is supra-political and supra-national," and so on. Isn't the big secret agent leader Yu Bin engaged in politics all day long? Recently, many foreign priests have been found to be spies for American imperialism. What is this if not engaging in politics?

　　Recently, there have been many publications, such as *The Holy and Universal Church*, *Learning Reference*, and *Basic Philosophical Problems*, etc., saying all kinds of nonsense such as "The Three-Self Patriotic Movement is apostasy and schism," which clearly shows that there are still manipulators lurking behind the scenes; also saying that "The Catholic Church has never had any connection with any imperialism, and if it admits to severing ties, it is tantamount to admitting that there was a connection," and so on. If these words are not imperialist elements trying to control Catholicism and enslave the Chinese people, then what are they? As for the recently uncovered "Catholic Patriotic Corps," "People's National Construction Advancement Association," and a large number of secret agents using Catholicism as a cover, it is enough to prove that the idea that Catholicism is supra-political is deceptive.

　　The Chinese people have stood up, which is intolerable to the imperialists. In fact, few of our Catholics have not been subjected to imperialist bullying; few of our Chinese priests have not been insulted by imperialists. Let's close our eyes and think for a moment, when did the imperialists treat us as human beings, when did they treat our Chinese priests as priests? There is a Bishop Wen in Tianjin, who is still alive, who said, "You Chinese priests are not priests at all." I heard this sentence many years ago, and yesterday (March 13th), the *Guangming Daily* also published it. "Chinese people are stupid and not qualified to be bishops." This sentence has also been heard by Chinese priests. "If you engage in patriotic movements, you should temporarily set aside your divine authority." This sentence has also been heard by someone. It is clear that the authority was given by them, but they insist on calling it divine authority; it is clear that the authority was given by the imperialists, but they insist on calling it divine authority. Isn't this greatly laughable?

　　In the past, Catholicism was often used by imperialist elements; nowadays, Catholicism is still inevitably controlled and manipulated by a small part of imperialist elements. Our patriotic Catholics, our patriotic Chinese Catholic priests, must greatly awaken, unite with the broad masses, recognize that we are Chinese, love our motherland, and not be intimidated by imperialists or anesthetized by petty favors. Be independent and unafraid. The founders of our Fu Jen, Ma Xiangbo and Ying Lianzhi, received very serious warnings from their superiors because they wanted to carry out a reform movement in Catholicism. This is glory, not shame. Stand up! If you are punished by imperialists for the sake of the patriotic movement, the people of the whole country will definitely support you. Are you willing to be an imperialist running dog like Yu Bin, or are you willing to be a patriotic Catholic like Xu Guangqi? Please choose for yourselves. I am very worried that individual members among you will be used by imperialists and will be subject to the sanctions and suppression of the people, so I am taking this opportunity to talk to you all.

　　Our Common Program has clearly stipulated freedom of religious belief, and the Chinese people will certainly guarantee your freedom of religious belief. Only a very small part of the Catholics are being used by imperialists; the majority of our Catholics love the motherland and oppose imperialist aggression, which is consistent with the political demands of the entire Chinese people, and also consistent with the goals of all the non-Catholics in our Fu Jen. I hope you will not easily believe rumors, and not mistakenly believe the absurd remarks of imperialists and their running dogs. Stand firm on the people's position, jointly assist the People's Government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries, strive for the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, and strive to build our happy and beautiful New China!

### 对辅仁大学的天主教徒讲话——节录传达北京市第三届各界人民代表会议讲话

　　对辅仁大学的天主教徒讲话
    ——节录传达北京市第三届各界人民代表会议讲话
      陈垣
    我们传达北京市第三届各界人民代表会议完毕，趁这个机会，对我们辅仁的天主教徒说几句话。彭真同志的报告里，政治方面特别着重抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命分子两项。抗美援朝运动，我们学校曾相当努力，今后仍当继续不断努力。至于镇压反革命分子，我们做得还不够，我们学校里曾发现过几个残余的特务分子，但都是公安部门发现，不是我们学校检举出来的。今后我们要特别小心，特别防范，特别警惕。
    我们辅仁本来是一个教会学校，教职学工里，不少教徒，尤其是同学中有中国籍神甫七十多人，如果把这种力量加入爱国主义运动中，可以起很大的作用。但是北京市天主教徒自立革新运动宣言，至今还未发出，这是北京天主教徒的耻辱。我们辅仁既然拥有一部分知识分子的教徒，又有七十多位中国籍的神甫同学，我们就要负一部分责任。这宣言迟迟发不出来，中间一定是有阻力。阻力在那里？就在背后有帝国主义分子把持、操纵、造谣、恐吓，说什么“天主教是超政治的，超国籍的”等等。大特务头子于斌，不是整天搞政治么？近日发现许多外籍神甫为美帝国主义作间谍，这不是搞政治是搞什么？
    近日又发现有不少的刊物，如《圣而公教会》，如《学习参考》，如《基本哲学问题》等等，说什么“三自运动就是背教，就是裂教”种种谰言，显见背后尚潜伏有操纵的人；又说“天主教会既不曾与任何帝国主义发生联系，如果承认斩断联系，就等于承认发生过联系”等等。这些话不是帝国主义分子想把持天主教，奴役中国人民，是什么？至于近来破获的“公教报国团”、“民众建国协进会”和大批借天主教为掩护的特务分子，更足以证明天主教超政治的话是蒙人的。
    中国人民站起来了，这是帝国主义者不能忍受的。其实我们的天主教徒，未受过帝国主义者气的，恐怕很少；我们的中国籍神甫，未受过帝国主义者侮辱的，也恐怕很少。我们试闭着眼睛想一想，帝国主义者几时当我们是人，几时当我们中国籍的神甫是神甫。天津有个文主教，现在还活着，他说：“你们中国神甫，都不是神甫。”这句话我好些年前就听见，昨天（三月十三日）的光明日报也登出来了。“中国人愚蠢，没有升主教的资格。”这句话也是中国神甫们听见过的。“你们若作爱国运动，就把你们的神权暂搁起来。”这句话又有人听见过的。明明是他给的权，偏要说是神权，明明是帝国主义者所给的权，偏要说是神权，这不是大大的可笑吗？
    以往的天主教，常为帝国主义分子所利用，现在的天主教，仍不免有一小部分为帝国主义分子所控制和把持。我们爱国的天主教徒们，爱国的中国籍天主教神甫们，一定要大大的觉悟，与广大群众团结起来，认清自己是中国人，热爱自己的祖国，不要受帝国主义者的恐吓和私恩小惠的麻醉，要独立不惧。我们辅仁的创办人马相伯、英歛之，就是因为要作天主教的革新运动，受过他们的神长很严重的警告。这是光荣，不是耻辱。你们站起来吧！你们如果为爱国主义运动而受到帝国主义者的处罚，全国人民一定支持你们的。你愿意作帝国主义者的走狗像于斌之流，还是愿意作一个爱国的天主教徒像徐光启那样呢？就请你们自己选择了。我很担心你们之中的个别分子会被帝国主义者所利用，要受到人民的制裁和镇压，所以借这个机会为诸君一谈。
    我们的共同纲领，已明确规定宗教信仰自由，中国人民一定会保障你们的宗教信仰自由的。教徒里受帝国主义者所利用的，只是教会里极少的一部分；我们大多数的教徒，都是热爱祖国的，都是反对帝国主义的侵略的，是和中国全体人民的政治要求一致的，和我们辅仁全体非教徒的目标也是一致的。希望你们不要轻信谣言，不可误信帝国主义者和其走狗们的荒谬言论，要站稳人民立场，共同协助人民政府肃清反革命分子，为抗美援朝爱国主义运动而努力，为建设我们幸福美好的新中国而努力！
