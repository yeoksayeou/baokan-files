　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The European Workers' Congress against the remilitarization of Germany will be held in Berlin from March 23rd to 25th. Workers from all over Europe are actively preparing for the congress.

　　In the German Democratic Republic, workers in various places are enthusiastically electing representatives to attend the congress. 280,000 miners in the Born coal mining area of ​​Saxony also submitted a letter of entrustment to the delegation of Saxony-Anhalt, which will attend the congress, suggesting the establishment of action committees against war in all European mines, and demanding that all miners unite under the slogan of "Not giving the imperialists a piece of coal or a grain of ore, and not allowing them to realize their war plans."

　　In West Germany, workers have elected 150 representatives. They dealt a powerful blow to the Schumacher elements who were plotting to sabotage the conference in the election. In the middle of last week, a total of 59 trade union committee chairmen in the Rhine-Ruhr area sent telegrams to the conference organizing committee to express their congratulations.

　　As of the 14th, French workers have elected 130 representatives. Miners in the Loire region, workers at the Renault car factory, and many other machine and metallurgical factories held election meetings and elected their own representatives.

　　Italian workers have also elected many representatives. Their delegation will be one of the largest at the conference.

　　Polish workers decided to elect 20 representatives. The mass meeting held to elect representatives has become a powerful demonstration.

　　Czechoslovak workers elected outstanding shock workers and production improvers as their representatives. Bulgarian workers have elected a delegation headed by Kodzekov, a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Federation of Trade Unions. Factories in Romania also held meetings and elected representatives. The resolution passed at the workers' meeting of the October Revolution Factory stated: "The crimes of the Hitler bandits should not be repeated, and must never be allowed to be repeated."

　　Hahnich, a representative of the conference organizing committee, pointed out in a recent interview with a reporter from the Berliner Zeitung: The task of this meeting is to establish unified action of the European working class and carry out the struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany. This meeting will pass a resolution that will make it impossible for the American and British warmongers and their lackeys in West Germany to turn Germany into a battlefield and drag the people of Europe into a third world war.

    在德意志民主共和国，各地工人正在热烈选举出席大会的代表。萨克森州波尔恩煤矿区二十八万矿工并向即将出席大会的萨克森——安哈尔特州的代表团提出委托书，建议在欧洲所有的矿场中成立反对战争的行动委员会，并要求一切矿工在“不给帝国主义者一块煤、一粒矿砂，不让他们实现战争计划”的口号下团结起来。
    在西德，工人们已经选出了一百五十名代表。他们在选举中对于阴谋破坏大会的舒马赫分子给予了有力的打击。上星期中，莱因—鲁尔区共有五十九个工会委员会主席致电大会筹委会表示祝贺。
    迄十四日为止，法国工人已选出一百三十名代表。罗亚尔省的矿工、雷诺汽车工厂的工人及其他许多机器厂和冶金厂都举行了选举大会，选出了他们自己的代表。
    意大利工人也已选出了很多代表。他们的代表团将是大会最大的代表团之一。
    波兰工人决定选出二十名代表。为选举代表而举行的群众大会已成为强大的示威。

    大会筹委会代表哈恩尼希在最近向柏林日报记者发表的谈话中指出：这次会议的任务，是要建立欧洲工人阶级的统一行动，进行反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争。这个会议将通过使美英战争贩子和他们在西德的走狗不可能把德国变为战场，把全欧洲人民拖入第三次大战的决定。
