Peng Zhen, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered the opening speech, stating: "Today, we welcome the victorious return of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council, headed by Guo Moruo. The Chinese delegation conveyed the Chinese people's firm determination to defend world peace at the World Peace Council meeting. The proposals made by the delegation have been fully adopted by the meeting and have become resolutions of the meeting, becoming the common resolutions of peace-loving people worldwide. Now, the delegation has brought back the resolutions of the meeting to report to everyone. We hope that these resolutions can be transformed into the common action of all Chinese people. All Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world unite together, we will surely be able to stop the war and maintain world peace."

Guo Moruo then reported on the achievements of the first session of the World Peace Council amidst warm applause.

Peng Zemin and Wu Yaozong successively reported on their impressions of attending the meeting and the impressions they gained along the way. They unanimously pointed out: The people of all countries warmly welcomed the Chinese delegation and strongly expressed their firm determination and confidence in victory in defending world peace.

Xiao San said in his speech: "The World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers is a concentrated expression of the will of peace-loving people all over the world. The five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, have the greatest responsibility for maintaining peace. Therefore, the World Peace Council calls on the people of all countries to launch a signature campaign to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. China is a strong member of the World Peace Council. We must closely combine the response to the World Peace Council's resolutions with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and carry out this movement universally and in depth."
