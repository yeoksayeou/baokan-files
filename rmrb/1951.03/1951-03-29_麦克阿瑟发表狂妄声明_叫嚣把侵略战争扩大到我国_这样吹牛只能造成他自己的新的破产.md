Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: MacArthur issued a mad and shameless statement before leaving Tokyo for Korea on the 24th, attempting to incite the American and British aggressors to expand the war of aggression to China. This war-monger, known for his boasting, deliberately pretended to forget the repeated defeats he suffered on the Korean battlefield, forgot the bankruptcy of each of his boasts, and boasted wildly about the "sea and air control" of the US troops invading Korea, saying that the strength of the Chinese People's Volunteers was "overly exaggerated," and that the "necessities of the forward troops of the Chinese People's Volunteers are not enough to maintain combat," etc. Then he arrogantly said: "If the United Nations decides to change its tolerant efforts to limit the war to Korea, and expand military operations to its coastal areas and inland bases, Red China will inevitably be in danger of immediate military collapse." MacArthur, therefore, declared like an idiot: he is "ready to hold talks with the commander-in-chief of the enemy forces on the battlefield at any time, seeking any military method that can achieve the United Nations' political goals in Korea without continuing bloodshed." MacArthur's statement was intended to intimidate the Chinese people and incite the American war-mongers' impulse to expand the war of aggression. But the Chinese people are obviously not intimidated, and MacArthur's mad statement can only lead to his own new bankruptcy and new crises within the aggressive camp.

　　麦克阿瑟发表狂妄声明
    叫嚣把侵略战争扩大到我国 
    这样吹牛只能造成他自己的新的破产
    【新华社二十八日讯】麦克阿瑟二十四日从东京赴朝鲜之前，发表了一个疯狂无耻的声明，企图煽动美英侵略者将侵略战争扩大到中国。这个以吹牛著名的战争贩子故意装作忘记了他在朝鲜战场上所受的迭次大败，忘记了他每次吹牛的破产，大肆吹嘘侵朝美军的“制海权与制空权”，说什么中国志愿军的力量是“过分夸张”的，说什么中国志愿军的“前方战区部队的必需品已经不足以维持战斗”，等等，然后狂妄地说：“如果联合国决定改变它为了把战争限制在朝鲜境内而作的容忍的努力，把军事行动扩展到它的沿海区域与内地基地的话，红色中国就必定有立即发生军事崩溃的危险。”麦克阿瑟因此像白痴一样地声明：他“准备随时和敌军总司令在战场上举行会谈，寻求可以不须继续流血而实现联合国在朝鲜的政治目标的任何军事方法”。麦克阿瑟在声明中妄想以此来恐吓中国人民，并煽起美国战争贩子们扩大侵略战争的冲动。但是中国人民显然是吓不倒的，麦克阿瑟的疯狂声明只能造成自己的新的破产和侵略阵营内部的新的危机。
