Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: According to TASS news: The Committee for Investigating the Atrocities of the American Armed Aggressors and the Syngman Rhee Gang of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, submitted to the Chairman of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly and the Chairman of the United Nations Security Council on March 1, 1951, the fourth investigation report on the atrocities committed by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang in Seoul, Inchon, and nearby cities.

The report begins by stating: The countless facts in the possession of the committee all confirm that the bloody crimes committed by the American thugs and the Syngman Rhee gang against the lives, freedom, and property of the Korean people have reached an extreme degree of barbarity. In the more than three months that the US-Syngman Rhee forces occupied Seoul, they killed, hanged, or executed with torture a total of 72,390 Korean patriotic people. Approximately 300 children and infants died of cold and starvation in Seoul prisons. In Inchon, the US-Syngman Rhee forces murdered over 10,000 civilians.

The report lists many instances of the bloody atrocities committed by the US-Syngman Rhee gang. On October 9, 1950, among the sixteen innocent people murdered by the bloodthirsty hands of the US-Syngman Rhee forces, some were cruelly had their arms and legs chopped off, their tongues, ears, and noses cut off, and their eyes gouged out. The breasts of two women were cut off. In Seoul, the American barbarians even scalped Korean patriotic people alive and kept them as "souvenirs." The US-Syngman Rhee forces inhumanely raped and murdered Korean women, even old women of fifty years old were not spared. They put Korean women in damp cellars, bound them naked to pillars, and used them as targets for shooting or bayonet practice.

The report continues: The US-Syngman Rhee forces destroyed or burned 80 percent of the buildings in Seoul. Seoul, an ancient Korean capital with a population of 1.5 million, was turned into ruins and a no-man's land, leaving only rubble and charred telephone poles. The American bandits destroyed 179 schools, three hospitals, two radio stations, six theaters, one museum, four newspaper offices, and many cultural institutions in Seoul. They razed priceless Korean historical heritages such as the bell tower, the stone hall of Deoksugung Palace, and the Gwanghwamun monument. They plundered or burned treasures and rare books in museums and libraries.

The report concludes forcefully: The American armed aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang, covered in blood, should bear full responsibility for all these unparalleled atrocities that cannot be fully enumerated, and for all the damage they have caused to the Korean people, and will be subjected to the most severe punishment.

　　朝鲜祖国战线发表调查报告
    揭露美、李匪帮在汉城的暴行
    在三个多月中七万余爱国人民被残杀
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查美国武装侵略者与李承晚匪帮暴行委员会，于一九五一年三月一日向联合国本届大会主席及联合国安全理事会主席，提出关于美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮在汉城、仁川及附近各城市所犯暴行的第四号调查报告。
    报告首称：委员会所掌握的无数事实，都证实了美国暴徒们和李承晚匪帮对朝鲜人民的生命、自由与财富所加的血腥罪行，已达到极端野蛮的程度。美、李匪军占领汉城的三个多月中，杀死、绞死或用毒刑处死的朝鲜爱国人民共达七万二千三百九十人。在汉城的监狱中冻死、饿死的小孩与婴儿约三百名。在仁川，美、李匪军杀害了一万人以上的平民。
    报告列举了美、李匪帮血腥暴行的许多事例。一九五○年十月九日，美、李匪军的血腥屠手杀害的十六个无辜人民中，有几个人被残酷地砍掉胳膊、大腿、割掉舌头、耳朵和鼻子，有的眼睛被挖去，其中有两个妇女的乳房被割去。在汉城，美国野蛮人竟然活剥朝鲜爱国人民的头皮，并把它保留下来当做“纪念品”。美、李匪军毫无人性地强奸并残杀朝鲜妇女，就连五十岁的老妇也难幸免。他们把朝鲜妇女放在潮湿的地窖里，混身赤裸裸地缚在柱子上，把她们作为射击或刺刀演习的目标。
    报告继称：美、李匪军使汉城建筑物百分之八十被破坏、被焚毁了。拥有一百五十万人口的朝鲜古都汉城变成了废墟和无人区，只剩下了一片瓦砾和烧焦了的电线杆。美国强盗毁灭了汉城的一百七十九所学校、三所医院、两个无线电台、六个剧院、一个博物院、四个报馆和许多文化机关。他们夷平了钟塔、德寿宫的石殿、光华门纪念碑等无价珍贵的朝鲜历史遗产。他们劫走了或焚毁了博物馆、图书馆里的宝藏和图书珍本。
    报告最后力称：满身污血的美国武装侵略者及李承晚匪帮，应该对这一切罄竹难书的空前暴行，对他们使朝鲜人民遭受的一切损害，负完全责任，并将受到最严厉的惩罚。
