　　The Living Welfare of the Soviet Working People

　　Due to the great victory of socialist construction, the Soviet Union has continuously reduced prices four times from the end of 1947 to this year. The first three price reductions have benefited the people by at least 267 billion rubles. This year's price reduction, together with the impact on collective farm market prices, will benefit the people of the entire Soviet Union by 34.5 billion rubles annually.

　　Due to the continuous growth of national income, the income of Soviet workers has increased year by year, increasing by 12 percent in 1949 compared to 1948, and by 24 percent compared to before the war. In 1950, it increased by another 19 percent compared to 1949.

　　In addition to receiving increasing wages each year, the Soviet people also enjoy benefits in medical care, vacations, and other aspects from state subsidies. In 1950, the total value of such remuneration and benefits reached 120 billion rubles, which is about three times that of the pre-war period.

　　Soviet workers enjoy a high level of cultural life. The various trade unions in the Soviet Union now have more than 8,000 clubs and cultural palaces, more than 9,000 large-scale libraries, 80,000 reading rooms, and thousands of cinemas. In the past two years, more than 4,000 new large libraries have been opened, with a collection of 14 million books. The trade unions now have a total collection of 45 million books. 104,000 amateur art groups already have 1.6 million members.

　　The Soviet working people enjoy the full right to rest guaranteed by the Constitution. Trade unions now have 1,100 sanatoriums, rest homes, and occupational disease prevention stations, all of which are located in scenic areas such as the Black Sea coast and the North Caucasus. Last year alone, 43 new sanatoriums were opened, and the trade unions' sanatoriums accommodated more than 2.5 million people.

　　苏联劳动人民的生活福利
    由于社会主义建设的伟大胜利，苏联自一九四七年底到今年已连续四次减低物价。前三次减价至少使人民获益二千六百七十亿卢布。今年的减价连同对集体农场市场价格的影响将使全苏人民一年获益三百四十五亿卢布。
    由于国民收入的不断增长，苏联工人的收入逐年上升，一九四九年比一九四八年增加百分之十二，较战前增加了百分之二十四。一九五○年又比一九四九年增加了百分之十九。
    苏联人民除了得到逐年增加的工资之外，还由国家的补助费中享受到医疗、休假等方面的利益。一九五○年这类的报酬和利益总值共达一千二百亿卢布，约相当于战前的三倍。
    苏联工人享受高度的文化生活。苏联各工会现在共有八千多个俱乐部和文化宫，九千多个大规模的图书馆，八万个阅览室和数千个电影院。在过去两年内共开办了四千多个新的大图书馆，藏书一千四百万册，现在工会藏书共达四千五百万册。十万零四千个业余艺术团体已拥有会员一百六十万人。
    苏联劳动人民享受着宪法保障的充分的休息权。工会现有疗养院、休养所、职业病预防站等机构一千一百所，它们都设在黑海沿岸、北高加索等风景优美的地带。单在去年，新开放的疗养院便有四十三所，工会的各疗养院共容纳了二百五十多万人。
