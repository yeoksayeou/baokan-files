Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 27th, commenting on the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions, stating: The peace-loving people of all countries will regard the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact and other resolutions as expressions of their hopes and desires. The development of the international situation increasingly convinces millions of people that defending peace is the cause of all nations worldwide. The Anglo-American aggressive bloc has obstructed the Soviet Union's proposals in the United Nations for concluding a peace pact, reducing armaments, and banning atomic weapons, and has launched a war of aggression in Korea, attempting to spread the flames of war to the whole world. However, the people of all countries have risen to defend peace. Now, the peace fighters have set themselves even broader tasks, and the First Session of the World Peace Council has put forward the most urgent task: to organize a mass movement for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. All honest people clearly see that the signing of a peace pact by the five major powers would be an important step towards maintaining and consolidating world peace. In response to the resolutions of the World Peace Council, the great army of peace supporters will fight the threat of another war with greater determination and perseverance, and will concentrate their efforts on completing the primary task—the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. The editorial concluded: The Soviet people wholeheartedly support the resolutions of the World Peace Council and will fight to defend lasting world peace.

　　真理报社论称：苏联人民全力支持和平理事会的决议
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十七日发表社论评论世界和平理事会的宣言和决议称：各国爱好和平的人民将把世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言与其他决议，看作他们的希望与意愿的表现。国际形势的发展越来越使千百万人民相信保卫和平是全世界一切民族的事业。美英侵略集团阻挠了苏联在联合国所提出的缔结和平公约、裁减军备与禁止原子武器的建议，并且在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，力图把战火延烧到全世界。但各国人民已奋起保卫和平。现在和平战士们给自己规定了更为广泛的任务，世界和平理事会第一届会议已提出了最急迫的任务：组织缔结五大国和平公约的群众运动。一切正直的人民都清楚地看到：五大国签订和平公约将是走向维护与巩固世界和平的重要的一步。为了响应世界和平理事会的决议，和平拥护者的大军将以更大的决心与毅力来对另一次战争的威胁进行斗争，并将集中努力来完成首要的任务——缔结五大国和平公约。社论结语称：苏联人民全心全意支持世界和平理事会的各项决议，为保卫世界持久和平而斗争。
