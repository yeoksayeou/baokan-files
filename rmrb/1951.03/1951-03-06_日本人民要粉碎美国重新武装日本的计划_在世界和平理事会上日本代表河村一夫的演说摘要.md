Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 6th: Japanese representative to the World Peace Council, Kazuo Kawamura, delivered a speech at the World Peace Council meeting on February 22nd regarding the re-militarization of Japan and the struggles of the Japanese people. The following is a summary:

I am honored to represent the Japanese people at this historic meeting. Since the end of the war, Japanese representatives have been unable to attend any international conferences demonstrating the great growth of democratic forces in the world. This is not because the Japanese people lack the spirit of internationalism. The Japanese people have elected their representatives each time, but all have been prevented by MacArthur. The presence of a Japanese representative at this meeting, overcoming all difficulties, is to show the Japanese people's determination to resolutely struggle against the US imperialist plan to rearm Japan.

When I met representatives from many Asian countries at this meeting, I was reminded of the many crimes that Japanese imperialism had committed against the people of these countries in the past! The Japanese people deeply feel that they bear a great responsibility for these crimes. Today, the task of the Japanese people is to crush the US imperialist plan to rearm Japan. Otherwise, we will not only fail to fulfill our responsibility to the people of Asian countries, but we ourselves will not be liberated. I believe that the Japanese people will definitely be able to accomplish this task.

(1) The Development of Japanese Re-militarization

The rearmament of Japan and West Germany has now become a global issue. But this is not a problem that has suddenly arisen today. The US is desperately rebuilding the Japanese army, and this is now the culmination of the consistently pursued development of rearming Japan throughout the entire occupation period.

At the end of World War II, the United States believed that the opportunity had come to plunder the fruits of victory on a large scale throughout the world, and it carried out this plunder. This can be proven by the US world policy – from the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and the various stages of the North Atlantic Treaty, to the open commencement of armed aggression against Korea. In the Far East, the United States intends to permanently control and monopolize Japan's superior strategic position, industrial production capacity, and 83 million people. From the beginning, the United States wanted to use Japan as a base for aggression against the Soviet Union, suppression of the Chinese revolution, and the liberation movements of various Asian countries.

First, the brutal and indiscriminate bombing that turned all the cities and villages of Korea into ruins and took the lives of countless people, and the hundreds of illegal bombings of Northeast China, were all carried out by US planes that took off from Japanese air bases. Japan has become a large network of US air force bases. There are eight large airports in Japan that can accommodate B-36 and B-29 bombers, 32 airports that can be used by medium and small aircraft, and hundreds of former Japanese military airports are being repaired and expanded.

The bases for the US fleet that shelled the Korean coast and blockaded the Taiwan Strait are also in Japan. The first naval base is Yokosuka, known as the largest naval base west of Pearl Harbor. Other former Japanese naval bases such as Kure, Sasebo, Maizuru, and Ominato have also been revived as military ports. Even commercial ports such as Yokohama and Kobe have been placed under the exclusive use of the US military. In addition, there is the construction of military highway networks, US military barracks, and military communication facilities. Japan has truly become a large US military base.

The US imperialists call Japan an "unsinkable aircraft carrier." This aircraft carrier was not built in a day, but was actively constructed over the past five years through the rule of Japan, the enslavement of Japanese workers, and the exhaustion of Japanese financial resources, and is prepared for the purpose of aggressive war.

Second, the weapons, ammunition, and many other military supplies of the US military invading Korea are manufactured using Japanese raw materials and mobilizing all Japanese factories.

As soon as the Korean War broke out, MacArthur issued various military orders to almost all major factories in Japan, including military supplies, construction materials, and food. By the end of last year, the total amount of military orders and labor costs had reached more than 250 million US dollars. As of October 10 last year, 248 Japanese ships had been requisitioned by the US military, with a cumulative total of one million tons; Japanese shipyards also received instructions to repair warships exclusively for the US military; 65% of the freight cars of the Japanese National Railways were engaged in military transportation. In this way, the Japanese economy has been transformed into a purely wartime economy. This is being carried out according to MacArthur's plan. Before starting the aggression against Korea, the United States adopted a policy of destroying Japanese peaceful industries and restoring military industries.

In terms of basic raw materials such as coal and iron, the annual output of steel in 1950 reached 3 million tons, close to the highest level of 1938 during the war. Important factories centered on machinery, metal, and chemical industries have been designated as factories managed by the US military. These factories have been transformed into purely military factories and are constantly being expanded, manufacturing anti-tank guns, assembling and repairing tanks, military vehicles and jeeps, and manufacturing various explosives. On the other hand, large amounts of gasoline and grain are being imported and stored in Japan. The supply of gasoline in Japan has reached the highest wartime level of 4 million kiloliters, and nearly 4 million tons of grain are being desperately imported every year. In this way, before starting the aggression against Korea, Japan had already fully become a US military warehouse.

Only after the US imperialists completed these basic tasks could MacArthur begin his open aggression against Korea.

Third, many Japanese have been driven to participate in the Korean War in various forms. The Tokyo correspondent for the Chicago Daily News confirmed: "Without Japanese assistance, the US military would have been expelled from Korea long ago."

The US military and military supplies are also transported using Japanese ships and Japanese crew members. The US military invading Korea has requisitioned many Japanese to engage in various military services. So far, according to the figures published by the Japanese government in the parliament, the number has reached 80,000, but according to general estimates, the actual number is more than 140,000. At the time of the Incheon landing last September, nearly 30,000 Japanese participated in engineering or transportation units, reportedly commanded by Japanese war criminal Tsuji Masanobu. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency dispatched minesweepers to participate in the US naval operations along the Korean coast.

But the more important fact is that, despite MacArthur's desperate denials, there are quite a few Japanese soldiers in the US military. According to the latest information, 10,000 members of the Police Reserve Force, which may serve as the backbone of the Japanese army in the future, have already participated in the Korean War. There are many Japanese aviation mechanics at Korean airports, and they are engaged in military work. It is said that without these Japanese, the planes cannot take off.

The above facts show that the Japanese people have been used as cannon fodder by the US military. This fact is made possible by the assistance of Japanese militarists and fascists to the United States. This means that US and Japanese militarists are colluding to revive the Japanese army.

(2) The Conspiracy to Revive the Japanese Army

Using 80 million Japanese people as cannon fodder is a long-standing wish of US imperialism. According to the latest information: MacArthur has secretly ordered the Japanese government to rebuild an army of one million, a navy of 500,000 tons, and an air force of 1,000 aircraft. They are carrying out this work using the following methods:

First, expand and strengthen the Japanese police force. Before the war, the Japanese police force was roughly 50,000 to 60,000 people. Now the officially announced number of national and local police is 125,000, plus the 75,000 Police Reserve Force established last year, the total number is 200,000. But the accurate figures are 150,000 for the former and 100,000 for the latter, with a total of 250,000. This is equivalent to the strength of the Japanese army's standing army before the war of aggression against China.

Building a huge army based on the police is what Hitler did back then. MacArthur is now following suit. Regarding this point, MacArthur's order to the Japanese government to organize 100,000 Police Reserve Forces shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War is particularly important. Because the Police Reserve Force is a purely military force and the backbone of the future Japanese army. Because there is a great shortage of cadres in the Reserve Force, MacArthur recently lifted the purge of more than 3,000 former Japanese soldiers; more importantly, after the purge was lifted, they were trained and managed by the US military. The first phase of training is scheduled to end in March this year. They are now being trained by US officers using US regulations with English commands. Their equipment is American-style rifles and machine guns, and they have begun to practice with tanks and cannons.

Parallel to the land forces is the Maritime Safety Agency. In the same way, this is the backbone of the Japanese navy. The Maritime Safety Agency has 18,000 personnel and is a nest of former Japanese naval officers and soldiers. It has 600 ships, including new ships of 2,000 tons, old Japanese destroyers, unused US Navy destroyers, and landing craft.

Second, diplomatic activities are carried out under the guise of promoting peace. The well-known warmonger Dulles recently visited Japan again to urge the Yoshida government to accept the US separate peace plan. The United States is attempting to exclude the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, conclude a separate peace treaty, and implement the rearmament of Japan; the work of uniting anti-communist and aggressive forces in the Far East with Japan as the core has reached the final stage.

The third method of rearming Japan is MacArthur's revival of Japanese fascists. He established a Kato (KATC) organization in the General Headquarters long ago, gathering former Japanese senior military officers to study operations against the Soviet Union and China. With these organizations as the center, many underground organizations of former Japanese army and navy officers are being taken care of and supported. Those underground organizations are even called underground governments. How the United States protects fascist militarists can be explained by the following facts: rejecting the Soviet proposal and not handing over the germ warfare criminal Emperor Hirohito to the international tribunal for trial; similarly, the germ warfare criminal Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii has been sent to the United States to participate in the US military's research on germ warfare operations; allowing war criminal Lieutenant General Nemoto Hiroshi to recruit soldiers for Chiang Kai-shek in Japan; 181 Class A war criminals, including former Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru, have been illegally released; the purge of 13,000 fascist militarists has been lifted.

Fourth, Japanese reactionary forces, echoing the US imperialists, are preparing politically and ideologically for the revival of the Japanese army.

Since the beginning of the Korean War, the Yoshida government has forced the Japanese people to participate in the national movement to support the "United Nations." This government has been secretly studying the conscription law, conducting military surveys of enterprises, schools, government agencies, etc., and preparing for forced requisition in the future. The reactionaries have also organized youth in cities and rural areas in the name of labor teams and industrial development youth groups, attempting to open up sources for military mobilization. Democratic Party leader and former Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida and others have expressed the opinion that the Japanese new constitution's provision to renounce war is not in conflict with Japan's rearmament. These people are emphasizing the crisis of war and spreading fallacies about Japan's rearmament.

(3) Colonization of Japan and Enslavement of the People

The above-mentioned policies of US imperialism are being carried out on the basis of ruling Japan in a colonial manner.

MacArthur has deprived Japan of its national sovereignty, controlled Japan's finance, industry, finance, trade, thoroughly plundered Japan's wealth, and turned the Japanese people into slaves. Japan's peaceful industry has been destroyed, the land has been barren, and the people's lives have been bankrupt. Workers receive starvation wages and are threatened with being thrown into the group of millions of unemployed. Farmers' agricultural products are forcibly taken away, and the heavy taxes for rearmament force millions of people to stand up and fight against taxation every year.

In order to keep the Japanese people in this inhuman life forever, MacArthur and the Japanese reactionaries have not only violated the Potsdam Proclamation, trampled on the Japanese Constitution and other laws and regulations, but also deprived the Japanese people of their basic human rights. Workers' right to strike has been deprived, assembly, parades and demonstrations have been prohibited, and all democratic publications have been banned. Speech is suppressed, progressive elements are purged from enterprises, government agencies, and schools on the grounds of ideological issues; patriots who oppose war are subjected to US military trials; democratic organizations of Korean people in Japan are dissolved; the 24 members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party are purged, and hundreds of communists are groundlessly prosecuted. The headquarters of the "Japan National Trade Union Liaison Council," which participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions, was dissolved. On May 30 last year, when the masses in Tokyo held a parade and demonstration against war and demanding independence, eight patriotic youths were groundlessly sentenced to ten years or less of forced labor on the pretext of assaulting US military police. The most brutal thing is that in August of the year before last, in order to suppress the struggling National Railway workers, the US occupation forces directed the creation of a train derailment incident and arrested 20 progressive workers, which is the so-called "Matsukawa Incident." At the end of last year, a colonial trial in Japan sentenced five innocent people in the Matsukawa Incident to death, five to life imprisonment, and the other ten to a total of 95 and a half years of imprisonment. This incident aroused the indignation of world democratic public opinion and was more brutal than the American "Sacco and Vanzetti" incident.

But after these twenty patriotic youths were sentenced, they issued a call from prison to the people of Japan and the world, saying: "We are being killed by the enemy because we demand independence, freedom, and peace; but we will fight resolutely to the last moment." This is the true cry of hundreds of thousands of peace fighters in Japan.

(4) The Japanese People's Struggle for Peace and Independence

It is only natural that this policy of US imperialism has met with unprecedentedly strong resistance from the Japanese people.

No matter which nation, no one wants to be subordinate to other nations. The Japanese people must struggle to liberate themselves. The Japanese imperialist policy of aggression during World War II caused serious damage to the nations of Asia, and also caused terrible disasters to the Japanese people. Therefore, the Japanese people do not want to be dragged into wars of aggression against other nations again, no matter by whom. We must stand up and fight against this kind of war.

"Absolutely oppose war!" "Strive for a comprehensive peace treaty to restore independence!" "The occupation forces withdraw immediately!" These are the central demands of the majority of Japanese people. All the struggles of the Japanese people, such as the workers' struggle against dismissal, the farmers' struggle against grain payment, the merchants' struggle against taxation, the women's struggle to defend life, and the students' struggle to uphold freedom, must develop into struggles for peace and independence. This movement is unfolding so widely in Japan that most scholars, intellectuals, and religious people are participating in it. For example, the former principal of the Gakushuin, a school for aristocrats, and the "Peace Problems Roundtable" organized by more than 50 professors from Tokyo and Kyoto National Universities have held three meetings and issued a declaration. At the third meeting held in September last year, they advocated a comprehensive peace treaty, opposed a separate peace treaty, and declared their opposition to the rearmament of Japan. The Academic Conference of the Japan Academy of Sciences decided at its sixth general meeting in April last year: "Science does not serve war." The 26 directors of the "Intellectuals Association" organized by well-known figures in the academic world, including university professors, writers, film directors, journalists, and lawyers, issued a declaration defending freedom of thought and speech.

Asahi Shimbun, the largest commercial newspaper in Japan, published an editorial during Dulles' recent visit to Japan, once again calling for a comprehensive peace treaty, which shows the general atmosphere in Japan. Even conservative political parties are no exception. The Socialist Party, which takes anti-communism as its guideline, is also advocating a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing rearmament; opinions on this issue have now been divided within the Democratic Party. The party had previously advocated a comprehensive peace treaty; only the Yoshida Cabinet and the Liberal Party are isolated.

The convening of the World Peace Congress, which leads the world peace movement, has further promoted the peace movement in Japan. In the summer of 1948, various democratic political parties, most mass organizations, scholars, intellectuals, and cultural figures united to form the "League for the Protection of Democracy." With this as the center, the "Society for the Protection of Peace" was established in 1949 and became the leading organization of the Japanese peace movement. Since then, the Japanese people have organized many "Peace Committees" in factories, schools, rural areas, regions, cities, and prefectures, using various names and forms, responding to the call of the World Peace Congress and actively launching peace movements. The initial achievement is: the number of signatories to the Stockholm Peace Appeal has reached 6.27 million as of January 10 this year. This peace movement has developed without exception beyond the boundaries of political views, religious beliefs, occupations, and gender. In Yokosuka, the largest naval port in Japan, an elder was accused of participating in the peace movement. He said fearlessly: "Monks who are keen on reciting Buddhist scriptures cannot but respect Japan's peace and independence." The "Kyoto Religious Circles Roundtable" organized by more than 60 temples and churches in Kyoto has voluntarily conducted peace signature campaigns. In various places, many mayors, town chiefs, and village chiefs of conservative political parties, and members of prefectural, town, and village councils have also participated in peace signatures and automatically served as initiators of peace committees. Various youth organizations, student groups, women's groups, and housewives, including youth groups of Buddhism or Christianity, and youth groups of all reactionary party systems, are at the forefront of the peace movement. It is a characteristic of the peace movement that today in Japan, you can be arrested just for holding an anti-war leaflet. Since the Korean War, the wartime system has been strengthened, and the Japanese peace movement needs to fight against the US military police and the Japanese police to achieve such results. The Japanese Peace Committee is preparing to mobilize 100,000 peace fighters to fight for 10 million peace signatures.

The resolutions and declarations of the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw have given the Japanese people even greater courage and confidence. In mid-January this year, dozens of organizations, including the Communist Party, the Labor-Peasant Party, the righteous faction of the Socialist Party, and the youth department of the Socialist Party, responded to the resolutions and declarations of the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw and held a meeting, resolving to launch a signature campaign of 10 million people for "striving for a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing rearmament." The Japanese Peace Committee has publicized the decisions of the Second Peace Congress to the masses, calling on peace organizations and mass organizations across the country to take the implementation of the Congress resolutions as their current task.

This kind of people's struggle has also affected the Police Reserve Force, causing great fluctuations in the force. Anti-war sentiment, anti-American sentiment, and dissatisfaction with treatment have begun to spread in the Police Reserve Force. The members of the largest unit of the Reserve Force concentrated in Hokkaido have won the mass struggle for improved treatment. This has forced the government to recently announce that the number of people who have deserted, been purged, or voluntarily left the team has reached 4,000. In this way, the US-Japanese reactionary forces cannot help but harbor great worries about the resistance of the Japanese people.

(5) The Japanese Situation Since the Korean War

US imperialism's aggression against Korea has made the Japanese situation even more tense; at the same time, it has prompted the Japanese people to resist the US imperialists and Japanese reactionary traitors more resolutely.

Japanese workers have long put forward the slogans "Oppose interference in Korea" and "Oppose the manufacture and transportation of military supplies" and are fighting for these slogans. They have organized extensive struggles in all factories and workplaces and are carrying out mass resistance movements. The struggle of 800 workers at the Mitaka factory of Tokyo Fuji Company is a typical example. Since August last year, they have opposed the factory's transformation into a military supply factory and opposed layoffs and wage cuts. Under clear political slogans such as "national independence," "opposition to war," and "upholding peace," they have launched a strike struggle that has lasted for half a year. The government dispatched 3,000 armed police officers to deal with these 800 workers and arrested more than 100 workers. Now, the factory side is exhausted, and the government and police are helpless. Workers in factories managed by the US military are now beginning to struggle under the bayonets of the US military. The heroic struggles of workers such as Yokohama dockworkers refusing to load and unload military supplies and Japanese sailors in Kyushu stopping US military transport ships are constantly taking place. The farmers' struggle is also becoming more intense. In the autumn of last year, farmers on Awaji Island, Hyogo Prefecture, took actual actions to resist the Japanese police and the US military police, and drove them out of the villages. This kind of struggle is taking place in many rural areas across the country.

Due to the US military's disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, the above-mentioned situation is accelerating. MacArthur's prestige among the Japanese has plummeted. Even among ordinary citizens, there is a mood of not fearing the US occupation forces. The bodies of US soldiers who died in the Korean battlefield are continuously transported to Japan, and then transported back to the United States from Japan. The bodies of US officers are transported by air frozen. Ordinary soldiers are only salted and transported by ship, and they smell bad when they arrive in Yokohama; these bodies have to be washed with seawater and then re-bandaged, and the United States has to pay a huge sum of 10,000 yen a day to hire Japanese to do this. This day's wages are more than a factory worker's monthly wages. Among these bodies, no corpses of black soldiers have ever been found. These facts are spreading rapidly in Japan like lightning.

Due to the transportation of military supplies, many Japanese people's goods have been suspended, inflation is unprecedented, and raw materials are difficult to purchase. Therefore, more small and medium-sized industrialists have gone bankrupt. In particular, the US ban on all trade with China has dealt a heavy blow to Japan. Because the cancellation of business contracts with China has caused Japan to suffer a loss of 15 billion yen. What is more serious is that Japanese industrial capitalists and small and medium-sized enterprises have lost hope for the future. Because of this, capitalists are openly demanding the reopening of trade with China, and anti-American sentiment is also rising.

From February 7th of this year, more than 200,000 workers in the large coal mines of the Japanese Zaibatsu system, ignoring the interference of Emmis, the chief of the labor section of MacArthur Headquarters, unanimously carried out an indefinite strike, reducing the country's coal production by 40%, a decrease of more than 50,000 tons per day.

What has been said above is only a small part of the phenomenon, but from this, we can see the intensification of the Japanese people's struggle and the split within the ruling class. In this way, Dulles and the Yoshida Cabinet's conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty and rearm Japan is encountering strong resistance from the Japanese people.

(6) The Solidarity of the Japanese People with the People of the World

US imperialism's rearmament of Japan seriously violates world peace. In the name of the Japanese people, I accuse the fascist who violates peace, the oppressor of the Japanese people -- the US imperialist -- especially MacArthur.

Undoubtedly, US imperialism's aggression against Korea will be crushed by the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This has greatly encouraged the Japanese people's struggle to drive US imperialism out of Japan. The victory and success of the Japanese people's struggle will not only ensure peace in the Far East, but will also lead to the destruction of US imperialism's entire policy of dominating the world.

For this reason, the Japanese people bear an extraordinarily great responsibility for world peace. We, the Japanese people, know that behind us, there is an increasingly powerful great world peace force. Therefore, we, the Japanese people, have chosen the path of peace and independence. No matter what happens, we resolutely refuse to be the "public enemy" of the nations of the Far East for the imperialists again. I hope that through this meeting, the Japanese people and the people of the world will unite more firmly, so that the struggles of both can be more closely combined to promote the establishment of world peace and the liberation of the Japanese people.

　　日本人民要粉碎美国重新武装日本的计划
    ——在世界和平理事会上日本代表河村一夫的演说摘要
    【新华社六日讯】柏林消息：日本人民出席世界和平理事会的代表河村一夫，于二月二十二日在世界和平理事会会议上发表了关于日本重新军国主义化的问题与日本人民的斗争的情形的演说，摘要如下：
    我能够代表日本人民来参加这次历史性的会议实在觉得光荣。在战后，说明世界民主力量的伟大成长的各种国际会议，日本代表一次也没有能够参加。这并不是因为日本人民缺乏国际主义的精神，日本人民每次都曾选出了自己的代表，但全都被麦克阿瑟阻止了。日本代表排除一切困难出席这次会议，为的是要表明日本人民具有对美帝国主义重新武装日本的计划进行坚决斗争的决心。
    在这次会议上接触到许多亚洲国家的代表的时候，使我想起过去日本帝国主义曾对这些国家的人民犯下的许多罪行！日本人民深深感到自己对这些罪行是负有重大的责任的。今天日本人民的任务，是要粉碎美帝国主义重新武装日本的计划，否则，不仅我们没有尽到对亚洲各国人民的责任，而且我们自己也得不到解放。我相信日本人民是一定能够完成这个任务的。
            （一）日本重新军国主义化的发展
    现在重新武装日本和重新武装西德已成为全世界的问题。但这并不是今天才突然发生的问题。美国拚命重建日本的军队，现在是美国在整个占领期间始终一贯地进行重新武装日本的发展的高峰。
    第二次世界大战结束时，美国认为在全世界大规模掠夺胜利果实的机会到了，并且进行了这种掠夺。这可以从美国的世界政策——从杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约诸阶段、以至公然开始武装侵略朝鲜的行为得到证明。在远东，美国对于日本的优越的战略地位、工业生产力和八千三百万人口，是企图永久加以统治和独占的。美国一开始就想利用日本作为侵略苏联、镇压中国革命和亚洲各国解放运动的基地。
    第一，使朝鲜的所有城市与乡村化为废墟，夺去无数人的生命的残酷盲目轰炸，对中国东北的数百次非法轰炸，这些都是从日本空军基地起飞的美国飞机干的。日本已成为美国空军的一个大基地网。在日本有八个可供Ｂ——三六和Ｂ——二九型轰炸机起飞降落的大飞机场，有三十二个可供中小型飞机使用的飞机场，此外还有数达百处的前日本军用飞机场正在修理和扩充。
    炮轰朝鲜海岸及封锁台湾海峡的美国舰队的基地也在日本。第一个海军基地就是被称为珍珠港以西的最大海军基地的横须贺，其他的旧日本海军基地如吴港、佐世保、舞鹤和大凑等地也都一一复活成为军港了。甚至连横滨、神户等商港也被置于美军专用之下。此外还有军用公路网、美军兵营、军事通讯设施的建设等。日本已真正变成美国的一个大军事基地了。
    美帝国主义者把日本叫做“不沉的航空母舰”，这艘航空母舰不是一天造成的，而是通过过去五年间对日本的统治、他们奴役日本工人、耗尽日本的财力积极建设起来的，是为侵略战争的目的而准备的。
    第二，侵朝美军的武器、弹药及其他许多军用物资，是使用日本的原料，动员日本的全部工厂制造出来的。
    朝鲜战争一爆发，麦克阿瑟便对几乎是日本的一切大工厂，发出各种军事订货单，订货包括军需品、建筑器材及食品等。截至去年年底止，军事订货及劳务费总额约达两亿五千万美元以上。到去年十月十日为止，被美军征用的日本轮船有二百四十八艘，累计共达一百万吨；日本造船厂也接到指令专为美军修理舰艇；日本国家铁路的百分之六十五的货车在从事军运。这样，日本经济已在转变为纯粹的战时经济了。这是依照麦克阿瑟的计划进行的。美国在开始侵略朝鲜以前，就采取了破坏日本和平工业及恢复军事工业的政策。
    在煤铁等基本原料方面，一九五○年钢材的年产量已达三百万吨，接近于战时一九三八年的最高水平。以机器、金属、化学工业为中心的重要工厂，都被指定为受美军管理的工厂。这些工厂在转变为纯粹的军事工厂和不断地经过扩大后，已在制造战防炮、装配和修理战车、军用汽车与吉普车，和制造各种炸药。另一方面，大量的汽油和粮食正被输入和储存在日本。日本汽油的供应量已达战时最高量四百万?，每年拚命输入的粮食近四百万吨。这样，在开始侵略朝鲜以前，日本已经十足地变成了美国的军事仓库了。
    美帝国主义只有完成了这些基础工作后，才能够让麦克阿瑟开始公然侵略朝鲜。
    第三、很多日本人已在各种形式下被驱使去参加朝鲜战争。支加哥每日新闻东京特派记者证实：“没有日本的援助，美军早已被逐出朝鲜。”
    美国军队和军需品的输送，也使用了日本的轮船及日本船员。侵朝美军征用着很多日本人从事各种军事勤务，到目前为止，根据日本政府在议会所发表的数字，人数已达八万名，而据一般估计：实际数额当在十四万名以上。去年九月仁川登陆时，便有将近三万日本人参加了工兵队或运输部队，据说是由日军战犯辻政信指挥的。日本海上保安队曾出动了扫雷艇，在朝鲜沿岸参加了美国海军的作战。
    但是，更重要的事实是，尽管麦克阿瑟拚命否认，在美军里面却有相当多的日本士兵。据最近所得情报，将来可能作为日本军队骨干的警察后备队，即已有一万名参加朝鲜战争。在朝鲜飞机场，有很多航空机械士是日本人，他们在从事于军事工作，据说没有这些日本人飞机便不能起飞。
    上面这些事实，说明了日本人民已被美军当作炮灰使用着，这种事实之所以可能，乃由于日本军国主义者、法西斯主义者对美国的协助，这件事意味着美日军国主义者互相勾结着复活日本军队。
            （二）复活日本军队的阴谋
    把八千万日本人民当做炮灰使用，这是美帝国主义由来已久的愿望。据最新情报：麦克阿瑟已秘密命令日本政府重建一百万的陆军，五十万吨的海军和一千架飞机的空军。他们正在应用下列的方法进行这一工作：
    第一、扩大及加强日本警察队。战前日本警察队大致是五、六万人左右，现在官方发表的国家及地方警察的数目是十二万五千名，加上去年建立的警察后备队七万五千名，总数是二十万名。但确实数字则前者是十五万，后者是十万，总数已达二十五万名。这就已相当于侵略中国战争前的日本陆军常备军的兵力。
    以警察为基础建设庞大的陆军，这是希特勒当年所干的勾当。麦克阿瑟现在也效法这样做。关于此点，朝鲜战争发生不久，麦克阿瑟命令日本政府组织十万警察后备队一事特别重要。因为警察后备队是纯粹的军队，是将来日本军队的骨干部队。由于后备队的干部非常缺少，最近麦克阿瑟才解除对三千名以上的日本旧军人的整肃；更重要的是在取消整肃后，使他们受美军的训练与管理。第一期训练预定在今年三月结束。他们现在正由美国军官用美国操典以英语口令指挥训练着。他们的装备是美国式的步枪和机关枪，并已开始在演习战车和加农炮。
    与陆上部队并行的是海上保安队。毫无两样的，这是日本海军的骨干部队，海上保安队人员有一万八千名，该队是日本的旧海军军官和士兵的巢穴，它拥有六百艘舰艇，包括二千吨级的新舰、日本旧驱逐舰、美海军不用的驱逐舰及登陆艇等。
    第二，假借促进媾和为名的外交活动。著名的战争贩子杜勒斯最近再度访问日本，就促使吉田政府承认了美国的单独媾和方案。美国企图排除苏联和中华人民共和国，缔结单独和约，实行重新武装日本；以日本为核心，在远东纠合反共侵略势力的工作，已到达最后阶段。
    重新武装日本的第三个方法，是麦克阿瑟使日本法西斯复活。他老早在总司令部内设立了一个加藤（ＫＡＴＣ）机关，聚集旧日本高级军官，在研究着对苏对华作战。以这些机关为中心，对旧日本陆海军军官的许多地下组织，加以照顾与扶植。那些地下组织，甚至被称为地下政府。美国如何保护法西斯军国主义分子可以从下列事实说明，拒绝苏联建议，不将细菌战犯天皇裕仁交国际法庭审判；同样的，细菌战犯石井四郎军医中将，已被送往美国，参加美军细菌作战的研究工作；允许战犯根本博中将在日本替蒋介石募兵；甲级战犯前外相重光葵以下一百八十一名战犯已被非法释放；取消对一万三千名的法西斯军国主义分子的整肃。
    第四，日本反动势力，与美帝国主义者相呼应，在政治上思想上为使日本军队复活进行准备。
    吉田政府自朝鲜战争开始以来，就强迫日本人民参加支持“联合国”的国民运动。这个政府已在秘密研究征兵法，进行对企业、学校、政府机关等的军事调查，准备将来强制征用。反动派又以劳动队、产业开拓青年团等名义，组织城市及农村的青年，企图开辟军事动员的泉源。民主党的领袖、前首相芦田均等曾发表意见说：日本新宪法规定放弃战争与日本重新武装并无抵触。这些人在强调战争的危机，散布关于日本重新武装的谬论。
            （三）日本殖民地化与人民的奴隶化
    美帝国主义的上述政策是在以殖民地方式统治日本的基础上进行的。
    麦克阿瑟剥夺日本国家主权，控制日本的财政、金融、产业、贸易，彻底地掠夺了日本的财富，并使日本人民沦为奴隶。日本的和平工业被破坏，土地荒芜，人民生活破产。工人拿着挨饿的工资，并受着被投入一千数百万失业群的威胁，农民的农产品被强力夺去，为了重新武装的重税，每年都迫使数百万群众挺身起来作抗税斗争。
    为了要使日本人民永远处于此种非人的生活之中，麦克阿瑟与日本反动派不仅违反波茨坦公告，践踏日本宪法及其他法令，并剥夺了日本人民的基本人权。工人的罢工权利被剥夺，集会游行示威被禁止，所有民主的出版物都被禁止发行。镇压言论，以思想问题为理由从企业、政府机关和学校整肃进步分子；反对战争的爱国者受到美国的军事裁判；旅日朝鲜人民的各民主团体被解散；整肃日本共产党二十四名中央委员，同时并毫无理由地检举了四百数十名共产党员。参加世界工联的“日本全国工会联络协议会”总部被解散。在去年五月三十日东京群众举行反战与要求独立的游行示威时，竟毫无根据地以殴打美国宪兵为借口，对八名爱国青年处以十年及十年以下的苦役。最残酷的是前年八月为镇压当时在斗争中的国家铁路工人，美占领军指使制造了火车出轨事件逮捕了二十名进步工人，这就是所谓“松川事件”。去年年底，日本的殖民地的审判判处松川事件的五名无辜者以死刑，五名无期徒刑，其他十人被判处总计九十五年半的有期徒刑。此事曾引起世界民主舆论的愤慨，比美国的“萨科与凡齐蒂”事件更为残酷。
    但是这二十名爱国青年被判决后，从狱中向日本和全世界的人民发出号召说：“我们因为要求独立，要求自由，和平，所以敌人要杀害我们；但是我们坚决斗争到最后一刻。”这是日本几十万和平战士的真正呼声。
            （四）日本人民的争取和平独立的斗争
    美帝国主义的这种政策，遭到日本人民空前强大的抵抗是理所当然的。
    不论那一个民族，都不愿隶属于其他民族。日本人民为解放自己不能不进行斗争。第二次世界大战时日本帝国主义的侵略政策，曾给予亚洲各民族以严重的损害，使日本人民也遭到了可怕的惨祸。因此日本人民，不论经何人之手，都不欲再被拖进侵略其他民族的战争，我们不能不为反对这种战争起而斗争。
    “绝对反对战争！”“争取全面媾和以恢复独立！”“占领军立即撤退！”这就是大多数日本人的中心要求。日本人民的一切斗争，例如工人反对解雇的斗争、农民反对纳粮的斗争、商人抗税的斗争、妇女保卫生活的斗争、学生拥护自由的斗争，都不能不发展为争取和平与独立的斗争。这个运动在日本是如此广泛地展开着，多数学者、知识分子、宗教徒都参加在内。例如以前贵族学校的学习院院长，东京、京都两国立大学五十余名教授所组织的“和平问题座谈会”，已经开过三次会并发表了宣言。在去年九月召开第三次会议时，他们主张全面媾和，反对单独媾和，并声明反对重新武装日本。日本科学院的学术会议，在去年四月第六次大会上，曾议决：“科学不为战争服务”。学界名流所组织的“知识人会”的二十六名干事，包括大学教授、文学家、电影导演、新闻记者和律师等人曾发表了保卫思想与言论自由的宣言。
    日本最大的商业报纸朝日新闻，在杜勒斯最近到日本时曾发表社论，再度呼吁全面媾和，由此可知日本一般的气氛。甚至连保守的政党也不例外，以反共为纲领的社会党，也在标榜全面媾和与反对重新武装；民主党内部现在对此问题的意见已发生分裂，该党过去曾主张过全面媾和；只有吉田内阁与自由党陷于孤立。
    领导世界和平运动的世界和平大会的召开，更加促进了日本的和平运动。一九四八年夏，各民主政党、大多数的群众团体、学者、知识分子和文化人等团结起来组织了“民主主义拥护同盟”。以此为中心，在一九四九年产生了“保卫和平之会”，成为日本和平运动的领导机关。自是以来，日本人民即以工厂、学校、农村、地区、都市、县等为单位，用各种各样的名称与形式，组织了许多“和平委员会”，响应世界和平大会的号召，积极地展开了和平运动。初步成绩是：在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名者，到今年一月十日为止已达六百二十七万人。这个和平运动不折不扣地超出了政见、宗教信仰、职业和性别的各种界限而发展着。在日本最大的军港横须贺，有一长老被控参加和平运动，他毫不畏惧地说：“热心念佛的和尚，也不能不尊重日本的和平与独立。”京都六十余个寺院、教会所组织的“京都宗教界座谈会”，曾自动去进行和平签名运动。在各地方，保守政党的市长、町长和村长，县、町村会议的议员中间也有很多人参加了和平签名，并自动地担任拥护和平委员会的发起人。包括佛教或基督教的青年团体、以及一切反动政党系统的青年团体在内的各种青年组织、学生团体、妇女团体、家庭主妇等，都站在和平运动的前列，这是和平运动的一个特征。值得注意的是今天在日本只要拿一张反战传单就可以被捕，特别是朝鲜战争以来已强化了战时体制，而日本和平运动能够获得这样的成绩，是需要与美国宪兵和日本警察作斗争的。日本的和平委员会准备动员十万和平战士，为争取一千万和平签名而斗争。
    华沙第二届世界和平大会的决议及宣言，已给予日本人民以更大的勇气和信心。今年一月中旬，共产党、劳农党、社会党正义派、社会党青年部等数十个团体，响应华沙第二届世界和平大会的决议及宣言举行会议，决议为“争取全面媾和、反对重新武装”展开一千万人的签名运动。日本拥护和平委员会，已将二届和大的决定向群众进行宣传，号召全国的和平组织与群众团体以实行和大决议为当前任务。
    这样的人民斗争，连警察后备队也受到了影响，使该队发生了很大的动摇。在警察后备队中开始蔓延着反战气氛、反美情绪以及不满于待遇等等。集中在北海道的后备队的最大部队的队员们，为改善待遇而作的群众性的斗争已获得了胜利。这就迫使政府最近不得不公布逃亡、整肃、自动离队的人员已达四千名。这样，美日反动势力不能不对日本人民的反抗怀着莫大的忧虑。
            （五）朝鲜战争以来的日本情势
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜已使日本情势更紧张了；同时也促使日本人民对美帝国主义及日本反动派卖国者作更坚决的抗争。
    日本工人们早已提出“反对干涉朝鲜”、“反对制造、运输军需品”的口号，并为这些口号而斗争着。他们在所有工厂和工作场所组织了广泛的斗争，进行群众性的抵抗运动。东京富士公司的三鹰工厂八百名工人的斗争，就是一个典型的例子。他们从去年八月以来，就反对该厂转变为军需工厂，反对裁员减薪，在“民族独立”、“反对战争”、“拥护和平”等明确的政治口号下，起而进行继续了半年之久的罢工斗争。对这八百个工人政府竟出动了三千武装警察，逮捕了百余名工人。而今，厂方已疲惫不堪，政府和警察也毫无办法。由美军管理的工厂的工人，现在也在美军刺刀下开始斗争了。横滨码头工人拒绝装卸军需品，九州的日本海员停驶美军运输船，诸如此类的工人的英雄斗争正在不断发生着。农民斗争亦在趋于激烈。在去年秋天，兵库县淡路岛的农民们，曾以实际行动抵抗日本警察和美国宪兵，并把他们驱逐出村落以外。这类斗争在全国许多农村发生着。
    由于美军在朝鲜战场的惨败，上述情势更在加速发展。麦克阿瑟在日本人中间的威信一落千丈。甚至在一般市民之间都充满了美国占领军不足畏的情绪。在朝鲜阵亡的美军尸体陆续运送到日本，然后由日本运回美国。美国军官的尸体是用冰冻着空运的。普通士兵仅用盐腌着由轮船运送，到达横滨时臭气四溢；这些尸体要经过海水冲洗，然后重新包扎，美国要付出一天一万日元的巨款，才能雇到日本人去干这件事。这一天的工资要超过工厂工人一个月的工资。这些尸体当中，从未发现有一个是黑人士兵的尸体。这些事实像闪电一样在日本迅速流传着。
    由于运送军用物资，很多日本人的货物被停运，通货空前地膨胀，原料购进困难，因此中小工业者破产的更多，特别是美国禁止对中国的一切贸易，给日本的打击甚大。因为取消了对中国的商务契约，已使日本遭受一百五十亿日元的损失。更严重的是使日本产业资本家、中小企业者失去对未来的希望。惟其如此，所以资本家公开要求重新开放对中国贸易，反美情绪也正在高涨。
    本年二月七日以后，日本财阀系统大煤矿的二十多万工人，不顾麦克阿瑟总部劳工科长艾米斯的干涉，全国一致实行无限期罢工，使全国产煤量减少百分之四十，一天减少五万余吨。
    以上所说不过是一小部分现象，但由此已可看见日本人民斗争的尖锐化和统治阶级内部的分裂。就是这样，杜勒斯与吉田内阁的片面媾和与重新武装的阴谋，就遭遇着日本人民的强烈的抵抗。
            （六）日本人民与世界人民的团结
    美帝国主义重新武装日本，严重地侵犯了世界和平。我以日本人民的名义，控诉侵犯和平的法西斯、日本人民的镇压者——美帝国主义者——特别是麦克阿瑟。
    无疑的，美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，将为英雄的朝鲜人民及中国人民志愿部队所粉碎。这对于日本人民驱逐美帝国主义出日本的斗争，起着极大的鼓舞作用。日本人民斗争的胜利成功，不仅会确保远东和平，并将使美帝国主义独霸世界的全部政策走向毁灭。
    因为这个缘故，日本人民对世界和平所负的责任是异常重大。我们日本人民晓得在我们背后，存在着日益强大的伟大的世界和平力量。所以我们日本人民已经选择了和平独立的道路，无论发生什么事情，我们坚决拒绝再为帝国主义者当远东各民族的“公敌”。我希望，由于这次会议，日本人民与世界人民将更牢固地团结，使两者的斗争更紧密地结合起来，以促进世界和平的确立和日本人民的解放。
