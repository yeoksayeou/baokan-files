            Beijing Increases Tap Water Prices
    In order to accurately calculate costs, extract depreciation from income, strengthen water quality testing and disinfection work, and construct water supply projects to increase the population drinking tap water, the Beijing Tap Water Company, with the approval of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, has increased water prices from the first of this month. The increased water prices are: retail water is equivalent to one jin of millet per metric ton, water for government agencies, schools, and ordinary users is equivalent to 1.5 jin of millet per metric ton, and water for industrial and commercial households is equivalent to 1.75 jin of millet per metric ton. Although the new water prices have increased the burden of drinking water for citizens, they are of great help to the development of the tap water industry. The newly set water prices are still much lower than the water prices before the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, only equivalent to 34 percent of the pre-war prices.

            北京市自来水水价增加
    北京市自来水公司为了精确地计算成本，从收入中提取折旧，加强水质化验和消毒工作，并修建供水工程以增加饮用自来水的人口，经北京市人民政府财政经济委员会批准，从本月一日起增加水价。增加后的水价为：零售水每公吨折小米一斤，机关学校和普通用户水价每公吨折小米一·五斤，工商户每公吨水价折小米一·七五斤。新订的水价虽使市民饮水负担增加了一些，但对发展自来水事业有很大帮助。新订水价与抗日战争开始以前的水价相比仍低很多，只相当战前的百分之三十四。
