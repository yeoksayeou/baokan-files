Review of "Advancing with Songs"
    Wang Ziye
    "Advancing with Songs" is the first film reflecting the record-breaking movement, and it is a film with positive and educational significance. In the old society, "stinky workers were looked down upon," but now workers are the most respected. The revolution has triumphed, and political power is in the hands of the people, with the working class being the leading class of the state power; this is a world-shaking change. With the change in the social status of workers, their attitude towards labor must also undergo fundamental changes. In the old society, they were slaves and beasts of burden for the rulers, so their attitude of dragging their feet in labor was inevitable and reasonable. But now, "creative labor is the true attitude of a master of the country."
    Once the consciousness of the working masses is raised, and their enthusiasm and creativity are brought into play, their wisdom is endless, and they can create miracles. This film tells us that a certain machinery factory in Northeast China used to take 12.40 minutes to machine a lead screw, but as a result of the record-breaking movement, it achieved a record of 2.40 minutes. Isn't this a miracle?
    The theme of this film is correct and clear. It expresses the struggle between new and old ideas, and the struggle between advanced and backward elements. New ideas triumph over and overcome old ideas; advanced elements reform and unite backward elements, which makes the movement move forward continuously.
    "In life, there are always new things and old things, growing things and dying things, revolutionary things and counter-revolutionary things." (Stalin)
    This film grasps the new things, growing things, and revolutionary things in life, and criticizes and negates the old things, dying things, and backward things. Therefore, the tone of this film is optimistic, cheerful, and healthy, giving people encouragement and increasing their strength. This is the basic success of the film.
    Past films about workers almost all focused on their intense labor, while this film revolves around the central theme of record-breaking, unfolding the multi-faceted and rich lives of the workers. In addition to working intensely beside the machines, they also live a happy life. They sing, play ball, fall in love, and have inner activities. One of the noteworthy features of this film is that it attempts to open up a new creative path.
    In terms of character creation, it also attempts to break away from formulaic expression techniques. It includes two typical backward characters, one is Li Guangcai, and the other is Wei Jinping. They both have their own characteristics, and their transformation processes are also different.
    The most successful character creation is Li Guangcai. Old Li is the most prominent character and leaves the deepest impression. He is the most skilled veteran worker in the factory. He is not completely without awareness; he also knows that "children are raised by their mothers, and hearts are made of flesh. We know how good the Communist Party is to us." But he is backward, he doesn't believe that record-breaking can be achieved, "This machine is made of iron, how can it have that kind of spirit, can listen to people, and if you ask it to be more active, it will produce more?" He has no ill feelings towards the young activist Meng Kuiyuan, and admires his ability, but dislikes him for being young and rash. He puts on the airs of an old-fashioned parent towards his daughter Li Xiulan, but in his heart, he loves her very much. After being educated and transformed, he finally understood. Listen to him advising Old Wei:
    "It's that our brains aren't working well. In the past, when the Japanese and the Kuomintang said east, we had to think west. We were afraid of suffering losses, and got used to thinking in circles, and now we've tied ourselves up."
    Young workers of Meng Kuiyuan's type are very common in the new society. The characteristics of this type of character are full of energy and vitality, and a keen sense of new things. Seeing such characters will make you feel strength and confidence. The author's writing of Meng Kuiyuan is also successful.
    I think it is worth mentioning that the author has not explored the essence of workers' lives deeply enough. For example, the author wants to write about the happy lives of workers from many aspects, so he puts in many lively scenes of singing, playing ball, holding meetings, and so on. Of course, such scenes easily show the happy lives of workers. But relying on this alone is not enough after all. The greatest happiness of workers in the new society is political liberation and economic improvement of material life, followed by happiness in cultural entertainment. The author has not paid enough attention to the first two kinds of happiness. Another point is that in order to insert a section about an arranged marriage, the author put in a businessman, Qi Ziming. This character is the least successful. From the entire script, the insertion of this marriage problem does not help the positive significance of the theme, and seems unnecessary.
    Finally, it should also be said that the trade union work is very weak in this film. At the mobilization meeting for record-breaking, only the factory director spoke, without the trade union's arrangements and calls. Of course, the trade union is not completely inactive. For example, the director of the trade union is quite active. He once mobilized Xiao Meng to persuade Lao Li to come out and take the lead. When Lao Wei made a mistake, the director of the trade union also talked to him. But it is not enough for the trade union work to be limited to these. In a mass movement like record-breaking, the entire trade union organization should be active and tense. In this film, we hardly see any activities of the trade union organization in various aspects. This is a relatively big shortcoming.
    In any case, this is a good film, and criticism of shortcomings may be a demand for perfection. I only hope that future films about workers can improve on this basis. (Editor's note: This film will be released on the ninth of this month.)

　　评《高歌猛进》
    王子野
    《高歌猛进》是第一部反映创纪录运动的片子，是一部有积极性的、有教育意义的片子。从前在旧社会里，“臭工人那里被人瞧得起”，如今却是工人最受人尊敬。革命胜利了，政权掌握在人民的手里，而工人阶级又是国家政权的领导阶级，这是一个天翻地覆的改变。工人在社会上的地位改变了，工人的劳动态度当然也要起根本的变化。以前在旧社会里，他们给统治者作奴隶牛马，因此他们对劳动采取磨洋工的态度是必然的，合理的。而现在呢，“创造性的劳动才是真正国家主人翁的态度”。
    工人群众的觉悟一旦提高起来，积极性和创造性发挥起来，他们的智慧是无穷无尽的，他们可以创造出奇迹。这部片子就告诉我们：东北的某机械厂以前车一根丝杠需要十二点四十分，由于创纪录运动的结果，竟达到两点四十分的纪录，这难道不是奇迹吗？
    这部片子的主题思想是正确的、明晰的。它表现了新旧思想的斗争，前进分子和落后分子的斗争。新的思想战胜了、克服了旧的思想；前进分子改造了、团结了落后分子，这就使得运动不断前进。
    “生活中总是存在着新东西与旧东西、正在生长着的东西与正在死亡着的东西、革命的东西与反革命的东西。”（斯大林）
    这部片子抓着了生活中的新的东西、正在生长着的东西和革命的东西，而批判了否定了旧的东西、正在死亡的东西和落后的东西。所以这部片子的调子是乐观的、愉快的、健康的，给人鼓舞，使人增加力量。这是这部片子的基本成功之处。
    过去的几部写工人的片子差不多都只限于写他们的紧张的劳动，而这部片子围绕着创纪录这个中心内容，展开了工人的多面的丰富的生活。他们除了在机器旁边紧张地劳动以外，还过着愉快的生活。他们唱歌、打球、也谈恋爱，也有内心活动。这部片子值得重视的特点之一是在于它试图开辟一条新的创作道路。
    在人物创造上，它也企图打破公式化的表现手法。它里面放进了两个落后的典型人物，一个是李广才，一个是魏今平。他们俩全有自己的特点，转变过程也不一样。
    人物创造上最成功的一个是李广才。老李这个人物最突出，给人印象最深刻。他是全厂技术最好的一个老工人，他不是完全没有觉悟，他也知道“儿是娘养的，心是肉长的，共产党对咱们怎么样，咱心里有数。”但他是落后的，他不相信创纪录搞得成，“这机器呢，是铁打就的，它哪有那份灵性儿，能听人的话，要他积极些，它就会多出活儿？”他对青年积极分子孟奎元并无恶感，也佩服他能干，只是嫌他年青冒失。他对自己的女儿李秀兰表面上还摆一摆旧式家长的威严，内心里是十分爱她的。经过了教育之后转变过来，他终于明白了，你听他劝老魏说：
    “是咱们脑筋不好使。从前日本人国民党说东，咱就得往西想想。是吃亏吃怕了，脑筋绕弯绕惯了，现在一绕倒把自己脖给绕住了。”
    孟奎元这样类型的青年工人在新社会里是很普遍的，这类人物的特点是精力饱满、生气勃勃，对新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉。看到这类人物就会使你感到力量和信心。作者写孟奎元也是成功的。
    我以为值得一提的是：作者对工人生活的本质还发掘得不够深。例如作者想从多方面去写工人的愉快生活，因此在片子里放进了许多唱歌、打球、开会等等热闹的场面。固然这样的场面容易表现出工人的愉快的生活。但单靠这点终究是不够的。新社会里工人的最大的愉快是政治上得到了解放，经济上物质生活得到改善，其次才是文化娱乐中的愉快。作者对前面的两种愉快注意得不够。还有一点，作者为了穿插一段包办的婚姻，所以放进了一个商人齐子明，这个人物是写得最不成功的。从整个剧本来看，这个婚姻问题的穿插对于主题积极性并无帮助，似不必要。
    最后还应当说一说在这部片子中工会工作表现得很薄弱。在创纪录的动员大会上，只有厂长讲话，没有工会的布置和号召。当然工会也不是完全不活动，例如工会主任是相当活跃的，他曾动员小孟去劝说老李出来带头，老魏犯了错误工会主任也找他谈话。但工会工作只限于这些是很不够的。像创纪录这样一个群众性的运动，整个工会组织应当活动起来，紧张起来。在这部片子中，我们几乎看不到工会组织的各方面的活动。这是一个比较大的缺点。
    不论如何，这是一部好片子，对于缺点的批评也许是一种苛求。我不过希望以后写工人的片子能在这个基础上提高一步。（编者按：这部影片将在本月九日公映）
