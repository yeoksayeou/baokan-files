　　Guarantee a Bumper Harvest This Year!
    Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team Challenges the Whole Country
    Ministry of Agriculture Calls for Energetic Response to Form a Patriotic Competition Upsurge
    [Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] The labor mutual aid team led by Li Shunda, a famous agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province, responding to the call of the National Agricultural Work Conference to launch a nationwide patriotic production movement, has taken the lead in challenging mutual aid teams across the country to guarantee a bumper harvest of crops this year.
    In their letter of challenge, the Li Shunda mutual aid team put forward a detailed plan for agricultural and sideline production for the whole team this year. They proposed to produce 378 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 21 jin compared to last year, exceeding the pre-war production level per mu by 108.4 percent. To achieve the above goals, they will cultivate three times, rake three times, harrow three times, and hoe three times in cultivation, and use new agricultural tools such as single-blade plows, liberation-style weeders, and sprayers on half of the team's cultivated land. Complete the soil improvement work of fifteen mu of cultivated land; apply 126 dan of fertilizer per mu (an increase of 26 dan compared to last year); ensure that 50 percent of the team's autumn fields are top-dressed. Ninety percent of the autumn fields will be sown with selected superior varieties after evaluation; all cultivated land will be rotated and seeds will be soaked and mixed with chemicals such as Wang Tong. Set up a "small farm" within the team for experimenting with breeding good varieties. In summer and autumn, adopt a combination of scientific medicines and machinery with existing experience to eliminate pests and diseases and overcome various natural disasters. In addition, according to local natural conditions, develop sideline production: plant 10 mu of codonopsis pilosula, afforest 40 mu, increase sheep by 23, pigs by 2, and draught animals by 2.
    In order to realize the above plan, the Li Shunda mutual aid team put forward five guarantees: (1) Strengthen patriotic education and study culture to improve political awareness. (2) Improve democratic life within the team, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of team members, and regularly check and summarize the production plans for each season and the whole year. (3) Strengthen technical guidance and research in each season, use labor and animal power scientifically, and divide labor according to each person's specialty. (4) Establish close contact with the village supply and marketing cooperative, promote the sales of agricultural and sideline products in a planned way, and supply team members with production and living materials. (5) In order to adapt to the actual needs of production development, extract 5 percent of the land harvest to buy common production tools such as single-blade plows, improved plows (three), and a hand-cranked flour mill, to consolidate the mutual aid organization.
    Note: Li Shunda was a famous agricultural labor model in the Taihang area during the Anti-Japanese War and attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers last year. The agricultural production level of his mutual aid team last year has exceeded the pre-war level by 95 percent.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government today made the following statement to reporters of this agency on the issue of the agricultural labor model Li Shunda mutual aid team in Shanxi Province launching a patriotic production competition with mutual aid teams across the country:
    Since last winter, on the basis of the movement to evaluate agricultural labor models across the country, a patriotic winter production competition has been launched. Facts have proved that this kind of production competition has greatly promoted winter production in various places. Now, a large-scale spring plowing production is about to be carried out across the country, and the agricultural labor model Li Shunda mutual aid team in Shanxi Province has taken the lead in launching a patriotic production challenge to mutual aid teams across the country. The leading organs in various places should attach great importance to Li Shunda's production challenge, vigorously mobilize and organize local agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams to rise up and respond to the challenge, in order to form a nationwide upsurge of patriotic production competition and smoothly complete the major task of increasing agricultural production across the country this year.
    The leading organs in various places should pay attention to the following issues when organizing mutual aid teams to respond to the challenge and in the production competition:
    First of all, when organizing mutual aid teams to respond to the challenge, the leading organs in various places should give play to the leading role of labor models and active production elements, and mobilize peasants to propose conditions for responding to the challenge to the Li Shunda mutual aid team on the basis of conscious voluntariness, so as to give full play to the peasants' production enthusiasm and creativity.
    Secondly, before responding to the challenge, peasants should be organized to deeply discuss the production challenge conditions proposed by the Li Shunda mutual aid team, and formulate practical and feasible response plans according to the specific situation of local mutual aid teams, as well as effective measures to complete the plans, to ensure the full realization of the response plans.
    Finally, leading organs at all levels should deeply understand the production situation of the mutual aid teams or peasants responding to the challenge in each period, and often help them solve various difficulties in production and summarize their production experience, in order to improve the peasants' production competition enthusiasm.

　　保证今年农作物丰收！
    李顺达互助组向全国挑战   
    农业部号召奋起应战形成爱国竞赛热潮
    【新华社太原六日电】山西省著名农业劳动模范李顺达所领导的劳动互助组，响应全国农业工作会议开展全国性的爱国生产运动的号召，已首先向全国各地互助组提出保证今年农作物丰产的挑战。
    李顺达互助组在挑战书中提出了今年全组农业和副业生产的详细计划。他们提出要每亩产粮三百七十八斤，比去年增产二十一斤，超过战前每亩生产水平的百分之一百零八点四。为达到上述目标，在耕作上要做到耕三、耢三、耙三、锄三，并在全组半数的耕地上使用单把犁、解放式耘锄、喷雾器等新式农具。完成十五亩耕地的土壤改良工作；每亩地施肥一百二十六担（比去年增加二十六担）；保证全组百分之五十的秋田施追肥。百分之九十的秋田播种经过评比后选出的优良品种；全部耕地作到调茬和采用王铜等药剂浸种拌种。在组内设立“小农场”，作培育良种的试验。夏、秋两季，采用科学药械结合原有经验，扑灭病虫害，战胜各种自然灾害。此外，根据当地自然条件，发展副业生产：种党参十亩，造林四十亩，增加羊二十三只，猪两口，耕畜两头。
    为实现上述计划，李顺达互助组提出了五项保证：（一）加强爱国主义的教育和学习文化，提高政治觉悟。（二）健全组内民主生活，发挥组员积极性和创造性，经常检查和总结各个季节的和全年的生产计划。（三）加强各个季节的技术指导和研究，科学地使用劳、畜力，按各人的特长进行分工。（四）和村供销合作社取得密切联系，有计划地推销农业和副业产品，供给组员生产和生活资料。（五）为适应生产发展的实际需要，抽出土地收获量的百分之五，伙买单把犁、改良犁三张，手摇磨面机一架等公用生产工具，以巩固互助组织。
    按：李顺达在抗日战争时期就是太行区著名的农业劳动模范，去年曾出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。他的互助组去年的农业生产水平已超过战前水平百分之九十五。
    【新华社八日讯】中央人民政府农业部负责人今日就山西省农业劳动模范李顺达互助组，向全国各地互助组提出开展爱国主义生产竞赛问题，向本社记者发表谈话如下：
    去冬以来，全国各地在评选农业劳动模范运动的基础上，曾经开展了爱国主义的冬季生产竞赛。事实证明这种生产竞赛，对各地冬季生产起了很大的推动作用。现在，全国各地即将进行大规模的春耕生产，山西省农业劳动模范李顺达互助组首先向全国各地互助组提出了爱国主义的生产挑战。各地领导机关对于李顺达的生产挑战，应当引起高度的重视，大力动员和组织当地农业劳动模范和互助组奋起应战，以便形成一个全国性的爱国主义生产竞赛热潮，顺利完成今年全国农业增产的重大任务。
    各地领导机关在组织互助组应战和在生产竞赛中应当注意以下几个问题：
    首先，各地领导机关在组织互助组应战时，应当发挥劳动模范和生产积极分子的带头作用，并要发动农民在自觉自愿的基础上，向李顺达互助组提出应战条件，以便充分发挥农民的生产积极性和创造性。
    其次，在应战前，应组织农民深入讨论李顺达互助组所提出的生产挑战条件，并根据当地互助组的具体情况，制订切实可行的应战计划，以及完成计划的有效办法，保证应战计划的全部实现。
    最后，各级领导机关应深入地了解应战互助组或农民每个时期的生产情况，经常帮助他们解决生产中的各种困难和总结他们的生产经验，以提高农民的生产竞赛情绪。
