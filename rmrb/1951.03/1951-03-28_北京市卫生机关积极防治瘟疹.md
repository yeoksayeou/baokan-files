Beijing Health Authorities Actively Prevent and Control Measles

To the Editor:
    Recently, many children in some areas of Beijing have been infected with measles. We know that in the Niujie and Xiaosijie areas of the Eighth District, three children have died from measles complicated by pneumonia; in the Zhenwumiao area in the northern suburbs, seven children died from measles in February. Some parents of sick children are unable to afford medical treatment due to economic difficulties; others haphazardly seek treatment from quack doctors, resulting in some deaths. Measles is still prevalent in some areas, and some cases have developed into acute pneumonia or laryngitis. We hope that the Beijing Municipal People's Government will pay attention to protecting the health of children and quickly provide rescue. We hope that free treatment can be provided for the children of working people with special economic difficulties.

    Editor's Note: Since January of this year, the Beijing Municipality has discovered the prevalence of measles in the suburbs and some urban areas. The Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau has attached great importance to this and immediately organized fourteen prevention and control teams, carrying medicines to conduct intensive prevention and control work in various suburbs. At the same time, medicines were also distributed to health centers and epidemic prevention stations in the urban area for prevention and control. The epidemic prevention staff not only publicized measles prevention and nursing methods to the masses, but also injected gamma globulin and adult blood into children near the outbreak sites, and provided free treatment for patients with economic difficulties. This work is still continuing. After prevention and control, the number of cases has decreased compared to before, and many seriously ill children have been saved. In early March, the number of measles patients increased again in the southern suburbs, northern suburbs, and Beixin'anzhen area. The Municipal Health Bureau dispatched additional medical teams to the above-mentioned areas to intensify prevention and control.

专栏：来信摘要

　　北京市卫生机关积极防治瘟疹编辑同志：
    近来，北京市某些地区不少儿童感染了瘟疹（麻疹）。据我们知道八区牛街、小寺街一带就有三个儿童因感染麻疹并发肺炎而死亡；北郊真武庙一带，在二月间也有七个儿童因瘟疹致死。有些患病儿童的家长，因经济困难，无力医治；有的则胡乱请庸医治疗，结果有被治死的。现在某些地区瘟疹仍继续流行，有的并转为急性肺炎或喉头炎。我们希望北京市人民政府注意保障儿童的健康，赶快抢救。对于经济特别困难的劳动人民的子弟，望能予以免费治疗。

    编者按：北京市自今年一月就发现郊区及市内某些地区流行瘟疹，市人民政府公共卫生局对此甚为重视，立即组织了十四个防治小组，携带药品分赴各郊区展开突击性防治工作。同时给城区各卫生所、防疫站亦配发了药品，进行防治。防疫工作人员一方面向群众宣传麻疹预防及护理法；一方面对发病地点附近儿童进行球蛋白和成人血注射，并对经济困难的患者予以免费治疗。这个工作迄今仍在继续。经过防治，发病者已较前减少，并挽救了许多病情严重的儿童。三月上旬，在南郊、北郊、北新安镇一带，瘟疹患者又较增多。市卫生局复加派医疗队赴上述地区，加紧防治。
