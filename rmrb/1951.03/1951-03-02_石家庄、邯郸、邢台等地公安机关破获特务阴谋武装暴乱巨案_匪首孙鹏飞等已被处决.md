The public security organs in Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xingtai and other places in Hebei Province, in collaboration, cracked a major case of armed rebellion plotted by the Kuomintang-Yan clique's party, government, military and special agents. The ringleader Sun Pengfei, secretary of the "North China Anti-Communist Allied Military and Political Committee Headquarters", director of the "Hebei Second Branch of the Anti-Communist Allied Association" and fake "Chairman of Hebei Provincial Government", the bandit Cheng Qiusheng, "Vice Chairman of the Second Branch of the Hebei Anti-Communist Allied Association" and fake "Vice Chairman of Hebei Provincial Government", "Chief of Staff of the First Army of the Anti-Communist Allied Army", the bandit Hou Qixun, "Commander of the First Army", the bandit Lu Tongyuan, "Deputy Commander", and the bandit Liu Xianya, "Secretary of the Military Department", and 43 other important counter-revolutionary criminals were captured by us. We also seized 4 bandit guns and 14 hand seals, travel seals, and official seals of the bandits Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, etc. In addition, we also seized bandit military alliances, drafts of telegrams, letters of appointment, a liaison letter from the culprit Sun Pengfei to Hong Kong, a letter from bandit Guo Yurong reporting the development of special agents to bandit Lu Tongyuan and a reply letter, and certificates of commendation issued to reactionary Taoist leaders and special agent Huang Hairu, etc.

The bandit leader Sun Pengfei and others were mostly old military officers of the Yan Xishan clique. After the liberation of Taiyuan, they fled to Suiyuan, contacted each other, and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, they planned to infiltrate the uprising troops in an attempt to disintegrate them. In May last year, special agents and bandits gathered from all over the place, using Baichuan Fort in western Suiyuan as a base, to contact scattered special agents and bandits and expand the counter-revolutionary organization. In July of the same year, the bandit leaders, under the order of war criminal Yan Xishan, organized counter-revolutionary armed organizations such as the "Chinese Kuomintang Anti-Communist Allied Military and Political Committee", the "North China Anti-Communist Allied Association Headquarters" and the "North China Anti-Communist Allied Army Headquarters". Bandit Sun Pengfei served as the secretary of the headquarters, and appointed bandit Hou Qixun as the commander of the First Army, bandit Lu Tongyuan as the deputy commander, and bandit Cheng Qiusheng as the chief of staff, sending them to Hebei Province to organize reactionary armed forces, develop special agents, and plot armed rebellion.

After the bandit leaders Hou Qixun, Lu Tongyuan, etc. arrived in Hebei Province, they decided to use Shijiazhuang City as their base of operations. The bandit leader Sun Pengfei instructed them, "Grasping the Taoist sects is more powerful than organizing an army." The bandits Hou, Lu, etc. first found Zhang Gaosheng, the head of the reactionary sect in Shijiazhuang City, and Huang Hairu, the leader of the sect in the "Jile Temple" in Shijiazhuang City, and jointly studied and decided to develop a special agent organization through the Taoist sect. It was also determined that "whoever controls the Taoist sect in a county will be the county magistrate; whoever controls three counties will be the commissioner." In November of the same year, bandit Sun Pengfei went to Hebei Province to "supervise" work and organized the "Hebei Second Branch of the Anti-Communist Allied Association" in Shijiazhuang City; planning to establish special agent organizations in nearby counties, districts and towns.

The bandits' plan for armed rebellion was: the first step was to establish armed groups of special agents and bandits to carry out sabotage activities such as assassinations and robberies; the second step was to gather small groups into large groups to launch rebellions; the third step was to quickly form nine regiments; the fourth step: if the US military invades the Chinese mainland, they would first occupy the countryside, destroy transportation, and then disturb the cities; if the conspiracy was difficult to achieve, they would turn to the mountains. Usually they printed reactionary propaganda and spread rumors.

When the invading US military landed in Incheon, the bandit leaders believed that "the time had come", and decided to actively expand their organization, use the reactionary Taoist sects to control the masses, and frantically engage in sabotage activities. When Seoul and Pyongyang were temporarily occupied by the US military, the bandits became even more rampant, rushing to make seals, official seals, appointing subordinates, collecting guns and men, and raising funds, plotting to take the opportunity to rebel. After the US and Rhee bandit troops were defeated in a panic, they secretly ordered the bandits to lie dormant for a long time and establish contact with Taoist leaders and special agent bandits in various counties.

During the same period, bandit leaders Sun, Lu, and Hou instructed bandits in Shijiazhuang City, Handan, Xingtai and other places to investigate the situation of our public enterprises, send people to infiltrate our state-owned enterprises and cooperative organizations, and wait for an opportunity to sabotage. The bandit Liu Xianya searched for and wooed the remnants of the bandit Wang Fenggang in the Mentougou Coal Mine in Beijing, and conspired to go to Xingtai to sabotage our warehouses, cooperatives and industrial construction, etc.

The bandits Hou and Lu repeatedly sent the traitor Zhang Gaosheng to steal our government's anti-espionage measures and party and government secrets. In September last year, when the bandits Lu and Zhang were lurking in Handan, they colluded with the internal traitor Feng Zhu, the manager of the Second Cotton Purchasing Station in Handan Town, to investigate the names of the local party, government and military leaders and the number of guns and men, etc. From September to December of the same year, the bandits successively incited the villagers and militiamen of Nanwayao, Xingtai, to plot rebellion. In addition, the bandit leaders gathered Chiang Kai-shek's puppet military officers and reactionary landlords, habitual bandits, and puppet police officers to disrupt our revolutionary order.

After the above-mentioned special agent bandits' conspiracy to engage in counter-revolutionary rebellion was detected by the local public security organs, the case was solved on December 23, 1950, and all 43 special agent bandits were captured. Bandit Sun and others, because the evidence was conclusive, confessed to the counter-revolutionary crimes they had committed. The Hebei Provincial People's Court, in accordance with the Central People's Government's instructions on severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, submitted to the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government for approval, and sentenced the counter-revolutionary criminals Sun Pengfei, Cheng Qiusheng, Hou Qixun, Lu Tongyuan and other 20 people to death; sentenced the bandit Wang Rugui and other 7 people to fixed-term imprisonment; others were released after education, and some are still under interrogation. The 20 principal counter-revolutionary criminals, including bandit Sun, were executed by shooting on February 11 in Shijiazhuang City, Handan, Xingtai and other places. (Attached picture)

　　石家庄、邯郸、邢台等地公安机关破获特务阴谋武装暴乱巨案
    匪首孙鹏飞等已被处决
    【本报讯】河北省石家庄市、石家庄专区、邢台、邯郸等地公安机关，协同破获了蒋阎匪党政军及特务联合组织的阴谋武装暴乱巨案，匪首“华北反共同盟军政委员会总部秘书”、“反共同盟会河北省第二支会主任委员”兼伪“河北省政府主席”孙鹏飞，匪“河北省反共同盟会第二支会副主任委员”兼伪“河北省政府副主席”、“反共同盟军第一军参谋长”程秋生，匪“第一军军长”侯奇勋，匪“副军长”路通远，匪“军部秘书”刘贤亚等四十三名重要反革命罪犯均被我捕获。我并缴获匪枪四支及匪蒋中正、阎锡山等手章、行章及关防、印记共十四颗。此外尚缴有匪军盟约、代电稿底、委任状纸、罪魁孙鹏飞去香港的联络信，郭匪玉荣向路匪通远报告发展特务情况的信及复信，发给反动道首、特务黄海如的奖状等多种证件。
    匪首孙鹏飞等多系阎匪锡山的旧军官，太原解放后，潜逃至绥远，互相联络勾通，继续进行反革命活动。绥远和平解放后，他们又有计划地打入起义部队，以图瓦解起义部队。去年五月间，特务匪徒们从各地集中，以绥西百川堡为基地，联络溃散的特务匪徒，扩充反革命组织。同年七月间，匪首们奉战犯阎锡山的命令，组织起“中国国民党反共同盟军政委员会”、“华北反共同盟会总部”和“华北反共同盟军总司令部”等反革命武装组织。孙匪鹏飞任总部秘书，并委任侯匪奇勋为第一军军长，路匪通远为副军长，程匪秋生为参谋长，派他们潜入河北省，组织反动武装，发展特务，阴谋进行武装暴乱。
    匪首侯奇勋、路通远等至河北省后，确定以石家庄市为活动基地。匪首孙鹏飞指示他们说：“掌握道会门，比组织军队的力量还大。”侯、路等匪首先找到石市反动会门头子张高升，石市“极乐寺”的会门首领黄海如，共同研究，决定通过道会门发展特务组织。并确定：“谁掌握了一个县的道会门，谁就当县长；掌握了三个县的，就当专员。”同年十一月，孙匪鹏飞到河北省“督导”工作，在石家庄市组织起“反共同盟会河北省第二支会”；计划在附近各县、区、镇都建立特务组织。
    匪徒们阴谋暴乱的计划是：第一步建立特务匪徒武装小组，进行暗杀、抢劫等破坏活动；第二步集小股成大股，发动暴乱；第三步迅速组成九个团；第四步：如美军进攻中国大陆，就先占领乡村，破坏交通，然后扰乱城市；如阴谋难成，就转入山地。平时他们印发反动宣传品，散布谣言。
    当侵朝美军在仁川登陆时，匪首们认为“时机已到”，遂决定积极扩展组织，利用反动道会门掌握群众，疯狂地从事破坏活动。当汉城、平壤被美军暂时占领时，匪徒们活动更加猖狂，赶制戳记、关防，委任部下，搜罗人枪，筹措经费，阴谋乘机暴乱。在美李匪军狼狈溃败后，他们密令匪徒长期潜伏，与各县道首、特务匪徒组织取得联系。
    在这同一期间，孙、路、侯等匪首曾指示石家庄市、邯郸、邢台等地的匪徒，调查我公营企业情况，派人打入我国营企业和合作社组织内，待机破坏。刘匪贤亚在北京门头沟煤矿寻找与拉拢王匪凤岗的残余匪徒，又密谋到邢台破坏我仓库、合作社及工业建设等。
    侯、路两匪曾多次派内奸张高升窃取了我人民政府的防奸措施和党政机密。去年九月，路、张两匪潜伏邯郸时，曾与内奸分子邯郸镇第二收花处经理冯柱等勾结，调查当地我党政军负责人姓名及枪支、人数等。同年九月到十二月，匪徒们先后煽动我邢台南瓦窑等村民兵，阴谋叛乱。此外，匪首们并集结蒋伪军官和反动地主、惯匪、伪警人员，破坏我革命秩序。
    上述特务匪徒从事反革命暴乱的阴谋，被当地公安机关识破后，于一九五○年十二月二十三日破案，四十三名特务匪徒全部就擒。孙匪等因证据确凿，对所犯反革命罪行供认不讳。河北省人民法院根据中央人民政府关于严厉镇压反革命的指示，呈经河北省人民政府主席批准，判处反革命罪犯孙鹏飞、程秋生、侯奇勋、路通远等二十人以死刑；判处匪王如魁等七人以有期徒刑；其他有的经教育后释放，有的仍在继续审讯中。孙匪等二十名首要反革命罪犯已于二月十一日分别在石家庄市、邯郸、邢台等地执行枪决。（附图片）
