    Wang Zhongchi of Jilin Jiangnan Chemical Factory invents a method for refining paraffin wax
    Wang Zhongchi, Assistant Engineer of Jilin Jiangnan Chemical Factory, recently succeeded in researching a method for refining paraffin wax and received commendation from Huang Yanpei, Minister of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government. The new method uses a special green shale for filtration and refining. Due to the success of this invention, the quality of paraffin wax has been improved compared to the past (appearing pure white), and the cost has also been greatly reduced. In the past, most of China's crude wax was shipped to Japan for refining. In recent years, although the Northeast had also imitated the Japanese method, the finished product was yellow in color and expensive, making it difficult to sell. Comrade Wang Zhongchi's successful invention is a significant contribution to China's industry.
  
    Guangzhou Liwan Navigation Channel Widening and Stone Dam Project Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Liwan Navigation Channel in the suburbs of Guangzhou is the best waterway for imports and exports in the Pearl River. In order to strengthen urban-rural exchanges in South China and develop foreign trade, the People's Government decided to widen this waterway from 50 meters wide and 3.49 meters deep to 100 meters wide and 3.8 meters deep. Widening the navigation channel can reduce the danger of ships traveling to and fro. This project started at the end of October last year, and was originally expected to be completed in mid-February of this year. Due to the efforts of all workers and comrades, the entire project was completed 37 days ahead of schedule, on January 10th of this year. A total of 14,860 cubic meters of sand and gravel were cleared, exceeding the original plan by 10 percent. The Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, together with the Guangzhou Shipping Bureau, inspected and handed over the project on February 12.

    吉林江南化学工厂王仲篪发明石腊精制法
    吉林江南化学工厂助理工程师王仲篪最近研究石腊精制法成功，并得到中央人民政府轻工业部黄炎培部长的嘉奖。新法系专用绿色页岩滤过精制。由于该项发明的成功，石腊质量已较前提高（呈纯白色），成本也大大降低。按过去中国粗腊多系运往日本精制，近年来东北虽然也曾按照日法仿制，但成品色黄而且价格昂贵，不易销售。王仲篪同志的此项发明成功，对中国工业实是一个不小的贡献。
  广州沥?航道开宽石坝工程提前完成
    广州市郊的沥?航道是珠江最好的进出口水道。人民政府为了加强华南的城乡交流和发展对外贸易，决定把这五十公尺宽、三点四九公尺深的水道，开拓到一百公尺宽、三点八公尺深。航道开宽，可以减少船只往来的危险。此项工程于去年十月底开始动工，原预期在今年二月中旬完工，由于全体工人及工作同志的努力，全部工程提早三十七天，在今年一月十日即已胜利完工。清除了沙石方一四、八六○立方公尺，比原计划超过了百分之十。珠江水利总局会同广州航务局已于二月十二日检查移交。
