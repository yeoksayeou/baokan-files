　　Reply from Shanghai Yuhua Tobacco Company Regarding Anti-Animation in Hongshi Brand Cigarettes

　　To the Editor:
　　We are very grateful for the enthusiastic correction made by Comrade Chen Jingyi in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your newspaper on February 22nd regarding the anti-animation in Hongshi brand cigarettes. The course of events is as follows:

　　In August 1946, our company, in order to increase sales of Hongshi brand cigarettes, drew and attached anti-Japanese war pictures inside the packets. We voluntarily cancelled these pictures in February 1949 and replaced them with Peking Opera pictures; and we published an announcement in the Guangming Daily on February 5th of this year that the pictures were cancelled. As early as May 11, 1950, our company also sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, along with samples of the pictures, stating that the use of anti-Japanese war pictures was purely for advertising purposes and that their use had been discontinued.

　　It is well known that cigarette wholesalers in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places have a habit of keeping cigarettes in storage for several years before slowly selling them. Given this situation, the Hongshi brand cigarettes purchased by Comrade Chen must be old stock from several years ago. Now, on February 27th, our company, following the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, has submitted the glass negatives and lead plates used to print the anti-Japanese war pictures to the Bureau for destruction. We are very grateful to Comrade Chen for his criticism and hope that everyone will offer more suggestions.

### 对红士牌香烟内反动画片  上海裕华烟草公司的答复

　　对红士牌香烟内反动画片
   上海裕华烟草公司的答复编辑同志：
    二月二十二日，贵报“读者来信”栏陈静义同志对红士牌香烟里的反动画片提出批评，这种热情的指正，我公司非常感激。事情的经过是这样：
    我公司在一九四六年八月，为了使红士牌香烟增加销售，便绘制抗战画片附在小包内。至一九四九年二月乃自动将该画片取消，改绘京剧画片；并于本年二月五日登光明日报公告取消。我公司早于一九五○年五月十一日，也曾将采用抗战画片纯粹是广告性质及停止采用等情况连同画片样子，函报上海市人民政府工商局。
    京津各地批销卷烟同行，爱将香烟收藏数年之后再慢慢出售，此种习惯尽人皆知。照此情况，陈同志所买的红士牌香烟一定是数年前的旧货。现在我公司已于二月二十七日遵上海市工商局指示，将印刷抗战画片之玻璃底版及铅皮版呈局销毁。我们非常感谢陈同志对我们的批评，希望大家多提意见。
            上海裕华烟草股份有限公司
        一九五一年三月二日
