  (I) Strengthen Leadership, Promote Successful Experiences
    This Association issued an important circular on March 14, calling on the people of the whole country to support the resolution of the World Peace Council, and to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement throughout the country, "so that every place and every person in the country receives this patriotic education and can participate in this patriotic action." All local branches of this Association should carefully study this document and, in accordance with the provisions of this document, work together with all democratic parties, people's organizations, and propaganda, education, and cultural institutions to promote its full realization.
    Local branches of this Association must strengthen their leadership over the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement of people from all walks of life in various regions. All cities, counties, and levels above cities and counties throughout the country that have not yet established branches of this Association should establish them universally in the shortest possible time. Those that have been established but whose institutions are not yet sound should improve them. The composition of the committees of each branch should include representatives from all democratic parties, people's organizations, and all social strata. At the same time, branches above the provincial and directly-administered municipal levels should set up two to three to four or five full-time staff to work. Although county and city branches may not have full-time staff, they should have part-time staff who are regularly responsible, so that it is possible to carry out active daily activities.
    The main key to strengthening leadership lies in constantly understanding the situation in the movement, studying various problems in the movement, and especially collecting successful experiences for promotion. This publication has not done enough in this regard in the past, and is now trying to improve. It is hoped that all regions will study and promote the experience of the Southern Jiangsu area introduced in this issue. The experiences introduced in the People's Daily in recent days are also worthy of attention, such as the achievements and experiences of Chongqing in resisting America and aiding Korea (6th), the experience of the Yucheng Resist America, Aid Korea movement (10th), several new ways of conducting Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in Shanghai (15th), train propaganda (17th), and the experience of establishing a propaganda network in the Northeast China region (14th to 18th). At the same time, we hope that local branches of this Association can also attach great importance to this work, promote successful experiences through local newspapers and periodicals, and frequently discuss various important issues in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in newspapers and periodicals, in order to promote the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
    To develop the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement universally and deeply to the extent that every place and every person in the country participates in this activity is the most important political task for patriotic and progressive people of all democratic parties, people's organizations, nationalities, and social strata. We hope that the leading organs at all levels of all democratic parties and people's organizations will all attach importance to this task, jointly assume the responsibility of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and strengthen the leadership of the patriotic movement of the people they are connected to. We also hope that newspapers and current affairs magazines across the country will attach importance to the task of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, strengthen the propaganda for this movement, and pay special attention to promoting the successful experience of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
  (II) Correctly Publicize the Situation of the Korean War
    In order to create favorable conditions for annihilating the enemy's active forces, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army temporarily withdrew from Seoul on March 14. Comrades who are responsible for mass propaganda in various places should explain this matter clearly to the people. This will not affect the prospect of the Chinese and Korean people's army achieving final victory, and this is precisely a necessary measure to further annihilate the enemy's active forces in order to gradually move towards final victory. But at the same time, we must tell the people that in order to completely eliminate the imperialist robbers who invaded Korea and completely liberate Korea, "of course, we must go through a considerable period of resolute, brave, and resourceful operations. Therefore, our compatriots across the country must continue to adhere to the sacred struggle of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the home, and defending the country, and strive to popularize and deepen the actual work and propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea." (See the Association's circular on March 14)
    To win the Korean War, we must eliminate the enemy's forces. The enemy's forces cannot be completely eliminated in one battle, and only a part can be eliminated at a time. Before the enemy's forces are largely eliminated, it is unnecessary and often harmful to compete with the enemy for a city or a place. This principle has been proven not only in the Chinese people's land revolutionary war, the war of resistance against Japan, and the people's liberation war, but also in the current Korean War. Because the Volunteers and the People's Army took the initiative to retreat, even the enemy now feels suspicious and uneasy about this "orderly retreat" and the fact that they "cannot find the Communist army." Even the invading bandit leader MacArthur also issued a statement on the 7th of this month, admitting that "if our army (referring to the US and Rhee army) advances again in the future, then this action will be more militarily beneficial to the enemy army (referring to the Chinese and Korean people's forces) than to our army." It can be seen that the gain or loss of Seoul is unimportant.

　　时评
  （一）加强领导，推广成功的经验
    本会已于三月十四日发出重要通告，号召全国人民拥护世界和平理事会的决议，并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动，“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这种爱国教育，都能参加这个爱国行动”。本会各地分会，都应很好地学习这个文件，并按照这个文件的规定，与各民主党派，各人民团体，各宣传教育文化机构共同努力，以促其全部实现。
    本会各地分会必须加强对各地各界人民的抗美援朝运动的领导。全国各市、县及市、县以上各级，凡未设立本会分会的，都应于最短期间普遍设立，已经设立但机构尚未健全的应该使它健全起来。各分会委员会的成份应该包括各民主党派、各人民团体和各阶层的代表人物，同时省、直属市以上分会都应设置二三人至四五人的专任人员工作，各县、市分会虽可不设专任人员，也应有兼任的工作人员经常负责，以便有可能进行日常的积极的活动。
    加强领导的主要关键，在于经常了解运动中的情况，研究运动中的各种问题，特别是搜集成功的经验加以推广。本刊过去在这方面做得很不够，现在正在设法改进。本期介绍的苏南区的经验希望各地加以研究和推广。人民日报近日所发表的重庆抗美援朝的成绩和经验（六日），榆次抗美援朝运动的经验（十日），上海进行抗美援朝宣传的几种新方式（十五日），列车宣传（十七日），东北区建立宣传网的经验（十四日至十八日）等文所介绍的经验，也值得注意。同时，我们希望本会各地分会也能十分重视这个工作，通过各地出版的报纸期刊，推广成功的经验，并在报刊上经常讨论抗美援朝运动中的各种重要问题，借以推进抗美援朝运动的发展。
    使抗美援朝运动普遍深入地发展到全国每一处每一人都参加这一活动的程度，这是目前全国各民主党派各人民团体各民族各阶层爱国先进人士的最重要的政治任务。我们希望各民主党派各人民团体的各级领导机关，大家一致重视这个任务，把普及深入抗美援朝运动的责任共同担负起来，加强对各自所联系的人民群众的爱国运动的领导。我们又希望全国各地的报纸和时事性质的杂志，重视普及深入抗美援朝运动的任务，加强对这个运动的宣传，特别是要注意推广抗美援朝运动的成功经验。
  （二）正确地宣传朝鲜战争形势
    我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，为了造成歼灭敌人有生力量的有利条件，已于三月十四日暂时地撤出汉城。各地担任群众宣传工作的同志们，应该就这件事向人民群众解释清楚，这不但不影响中朝人民军队取得最后胜利的前途，而且这正是为了进一步地歼灭敌人有生力量以便逐步地走向最后胜利的必要措施。但同时又要告诉人民，要彻底消灭侵略朝鲜的帝国主义强盗，全部解放朝鲜，“当然还必须经过一个相当长时期的坚决、勇敢和机智的作战，因此，我全国同胞必须继续坚持抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争，努力普及和深入抗美援朝的实际工作和宣传教育工作。”（见三月十四日本会通告）
    朝鲜战争要得到胜利，就要消灭敌人的力量。敌人的力量不是一次作战可以完全消灭的，一次只能消灭一部分。在敌人的力量没有大部消灭以前，与敌人争夺一城一地是不必要的，而且常常是有害的。这个道理，不但在中国人民土地革命战争、抗日战争和人民解放战争中证明了，而且在这次朝鲜战争中也证明了。因为志愿军和人民军是主动的后撤，所以现在连敌人也对这种“井然有序的退却”、“找不到共军”的事实感觉疑惧不安。甚至侵略匪首麦克阿瑟也在本月七日发表声明，承认“今后我军（指美李匪军）如再前进的话，那末这种行动在军事上对敌军（指中朝人民部队）有利的程度将比对我军为甚”。由此可见，汉城的得失是无关紧要的了。
