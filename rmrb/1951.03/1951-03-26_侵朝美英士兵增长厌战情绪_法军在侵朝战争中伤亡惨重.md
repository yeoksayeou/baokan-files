　　Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: Anti-war sentiment among US and British soldiers invading Korea continues to grow. According to TASS: The American newspaper *Chicago News* published a dispatch from its reporter in Korea, admitting that American soldiers are unwilling to fight in Korea and hope to return home. The reporter wrote: "Soldiers believe that the only way to return home at present is to sleep on a stretcher." The reporter then quoted a representative confession from US Army Captain Louis Diaz: "Nothing would improve the morale of American soldiers in Korea more than retreating back home."

    The London *Daily Worker*, the organ of the British Communist Party, published an abstract of a letter from a British soldier in Korea on March 20th. This soldier wrote that he and other soldiers were "eager to go home and withdraw from the war they do not want to fight." He pointed out that most of his comrades were reservists whose terms of conscription were almost up. His term of service expired on October 14th—three days before sailing to Korea. The letter revealed that British War Minister Strachey was lying completely when he said that the morale of the British troops in Korea was high. He wrote: "We are all forced to join the army, how can the morale be high? If Strachey continues to deny this, why is he afraid of investigating the suffering of the soldiers?"

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 24th: The commander of the French battalion, Monclar, an accomplice in the American invasion of Korea, admitted upon arriving in Paris on the 17th that his unit had suffered 33 percent casualties and urgently needed "reorganization." The French newspaper *l'Humanité* said on the 20th that Monclar was sent back by MacArthur to solicit the cannon fodder needed by his American masters, who usually send French mercenaries to cover the American troops.

    法军在侵朝战争中伤亡惨重
    【新华社二十五日讯】侵朝美英军队的士兵的厌战情绪，正继续增长。据塔斯社讯：美国《芝加哥新闻》刊登该报记者从朝鲜发回的电讯，承认美国士兵不愿意在朝鲜打仗，希望回国。该记者写道：“士兵们认为目前要回国只有一个办法，那就是睡担架。”该记者接着引述美军上尉路易斯·迪亚的富有代表性的自供说：“没有什么东西比撤退回国更能提高在朝鲜的美国士兵的士气。”
    英国共产党机关报伦敦《工人日报》三月二十日刊载了一个在朝鲜的英国兵士的来信摘要。这个兵士写道，他和其他的兵士都“热望回家，退出他们所不愿打的仗”。他指出，他的同伴们大多数都是后备兵，他们应被征入军队的期限差不多都已经满了。他的服役期限在十月十四日——开到朝鲜的前三天就已满了。信中揭露说：英国陆军部长斯特拉彻曾说，在朝鲜的英国军队士气很高，这完全是撒谎。他写道：“我们都是被迫从军的人，士气怎样会高呢？如果斯特拉彻继续否认这一点，他为什么又害怕调查军人的苦痛呢？”
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】美国侵略朝鲜的帮凶、法国营营长梦克拉，在十七日抵达巴黎时，承认他的部队已经伤亡百分之三十三，并且亟需“整编”。法国人道报二十日说：梦克拉是被麦克阿瑟送回来索取美国主子们所需要的炮灰的，美国主子们通常总派法国雇佣兵掩护美国部队。
