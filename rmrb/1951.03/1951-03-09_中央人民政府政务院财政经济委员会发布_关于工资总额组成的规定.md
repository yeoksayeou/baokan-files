　　In order to facilitate the calculation of total wages by various state-owned enterprises when preparing labor plans, and to facilitate the payment of trade union dues, labor insurance premiums, and unemployment relief funds by administrative or employer parties of various public and private enterprises in accordance with the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, the Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China, and the Interim Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers, the following regulations are made regarding the composition of total wages:

　　I. All wages paid by the administrative or employer parties of enterprises to their employed registered personnel (including wages paid in other forms) shall be included in the total wage amount.

　　Registered personnel include the following: (1) Production workers, (2) Apprentices and trainee workers, (3) Engineering and technical personnel, (4) Management personnel, (5) Janitorial staff, (6) Fire and security personnel.

　　Note: All income of employers and their agents in private enterprises shall not be included.

　　II. The total wage amount shall include the following:

　　(1) Basic wage:

　　2. Piece-rate wages directly paid according to piece-rate prices (including direct unrestricted, progressive, and collective piece-rate forms);

　　3. Time-based bonuses (such as bonuses for improving quality, saving fuel, saving power, and preventing accidents);

　　5. Wages paid in other forms, such as food allowances, housing subsidies, and utility subsidies. However, the so-called wages paid in other forms refer to those issued to employees in the form of allowances. As for housing without rent or utility fees, it is not included in the total wage amount because it is difficult to calculate.

　　III. The total wage amount does not include the following:

　　V. For enterprises, farms, institutions, and schools that have staff on a supply system or contract system, their benefits are not included in the total wage amount used for collecting trade union dues and labor insurance premiums. As for the trade union dues that the administrative side must pay for staff on a supply system or contract system, it shall be handled in accordance with Item 1 of the joint notification issued by the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government on October 11, 1950.

　　VI. When various expenses that enterprises should pay are calculated according to the enterprise's total wage amount as stipulated by law, the total wage amount used shall not exceed the scope limited by these regulations. If individual enterprises find it difficult to implement certain items of these regulations, they may report to the local labor administrative authorities for handling.

　　中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会发布
    关于工资总额组成的规定
    为便于各公营企业编制劳动计划时计算工资总额，以及便于各公私企业行政方面或资方按照中华人民共和国工会法、中华人民共和国劳动保险条例及救济失业工人暂行办法之规定缴纳工会经费、劳动保险金及失业救济基金起见，特对工资总额组成作如下规定：
    一、凡由各企业行政方面或资方对其所雇用的在册人员所支的工资（包括以其他形式支付的工资在内），均应包括于工资总额之内。
    在册人员包括下列各项人员：（一）生产工人，（二）学徒工及见习工人，（三）工程及技术人员，（四）管理人员，（五）勤杂人员，（六）消防警卫人员。

    ５、用其他形式支付的工资，如伙食津贴、房贴、水电贴。但所谓用其他形式支付的工资是指用津贴形式发给职工者，至于住工房不收房租水电费，因其难于计算，故不包括在工资总额之内。
    三、工资总额不包括下列各项：

    （二）企业缴纳的劳动保险金、工会经费、失业救济基金等；
