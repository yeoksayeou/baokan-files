　　Reply to Request for Music Criticism

　　To the Editorial Comrades:

　　We have read the letter from Comrades Guo Hua and two others published in the 87th issue of "People's Literature and Art" requesting the strengthening of criticism of music and songs. They hope to strengthen criticism of various old and new music, the music of various ethnic groups in China, various foreign music, music in operas, ballads, and movies, and various singing and playing methods; and they also hope to systematically introduce various excellent works. We believe this opinion is completely correct and necessary. "People's Music" has also included these tasks in its own plan and has begun to do so. The two collections of songs for resisting America and aiding Korea, compiled by the All-China Musicians Association, were selected from hundreds of songs for resisting America and aiding Korea. However, due to insufficient understanding of the music movement in various regions and a lack of regular research, this work of recommendation and introduction appears to be both weak and unsystematic, far from meeting objective requirements.

　　The All-China Musicians Association has convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee in response to the opinions raised by Comrades Guo Hua and others, reviewed the editing work of the first volume of "People's Music" (a preliminary summary has been made and published in the first issue of the second volume of "People's Music"), studied specific measures to strengthen criticism and introduction work in the future, and decided to establish a theoretical research group under the Standing Committee of the Musicians Association to promote this work. At the same time, it is suggested that local musicians associations further improve their leadership cores, regularly study musical works, and be responsible for recommending excellent creations.

　　We hope that the cultural departments of governments at all levels and local radio stations will also work with us to overcome this serious state of lack of leadership.

              All-China Musicians Association

### 对要求音乐批评的答复

专栏：读者来信

　　对要求音乐批评的答复编辑同志：
    《人民文艺》第八十七期所载国华等三同志要求加强音乐和歌曲的评论的信，已经读到。他们希望加强对于各种新旧音乐，对于中国各民族的音乐，对于各种外国音乐，对于戏曲、曲艺和电影中的音乐，对于各式的唱法和奏法的批评；并且希望对各种优秀的作品作有系统的介绍。我们认为这个意见是完全正确的，必要的。《人民音乐》也曾把这些工作列入自己的计划中，并开始去做。中华全国音乐工作者协会编的两本抗美援朝歌曲选，就是从几百首抗美援朝的歌曲中选出来的。但由于对各地音乐运动情况不够了解，又缺乏经常的研究，因此这些推荐介绍工作就显得既无力量，又不系统，距离客观的要求很远。
    全国音协已就国华等同志提出的意见召开扩大常委会，检讨了《人民音乐》第一卷的编辑工作（已作出初步总结，载于二卷一期《人民音乐》），研究了今后加强评论、介绍工作的具体办法，并决定在音协常委会下成立一理论研究小组，推动这一工作。同时提请各地音协进一步健全领导核心，经常研究音乐作品，负责推荐优秀创作。
    我们希望各级政府文化部门，各地广播电台也和我们一起来克服这种严重存在的无领导状态。
              中华全国音乐工作者协会
