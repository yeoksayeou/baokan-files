　　Answering Readers' Questions on Increasing Cotton Production

　　Question: What exactly are the standards for cotton yield per unit area? Last year, I heard that a model worker was planning to produce 1,000 jin per mu, but the highest record published in the newspaper was only over 600 jin; at the same time, it was said that the average yield was only 70 to 80 jin per mu. Why is there such a big difference? Also, I heard that the Soviet Union can produce more than 1,000 jin per mu. But what is the actual yield? Please answer.

　　Answer: The cotton yield per unit area varies greatly due to the relatively complex planting techniques, high labor and material costs, and the fact that diseases and pests cannot be completely overcome. Based on the current cotton planting situation in our country, poor planting results in only 10 to 20 jin or even a few jin of seed cotton per mu, while good planting can yield more than 300 jin of seed cotton. Generally, the yield is around several dozen to over 100 jin of seed cotton. Producing 400 to 500 jin of seed cotton per mu is still rare, and producing over 600 jin is even more of an isolated phenomenon. Therefore, when averaging the good and bad plantings in a region, the yield is only around 70 to 80 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to about 20 jin of ginned cotton (3 jin of seed cotton equal 1 jin of ginned cotton). Last year, a model worker set a plan to produce 1,000 jin per mu, but it was not achieved. The Soviet Union's production conditions are highly developed. With reasonable crop rotation systems and advanced cotton planting techniques, reports indicate they have achieved a record high of 1,900 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is of course not the general standard. However, this shows the broad prospects for increasing cotton yield per unit area, and also indicates that the current cotton yield level in our country is still very low, and it is necessary and possible to strive for improvement.

　　Question: Mutual aid teams across the country have launched cotton production increase competitions to promote the increase of cotton yield per unit area. What are the most important and specific conditions? If excessive labor and material costs are incurred, leading to increased costs, will this be in line with actual requirements?

　　Answer: What are the most important and specific conditions for increasing cotton yield per unit area? This should be determined based on the actual problems existing in cotton cultivation in various regions, and based on the combination of summarizing the experience of the masses and scientific technology, to determine the necessary and appropriate measures for each region; gradually improve and enhance on the basis of existing cultivation. Generally speaking, improving cotton varieties, building water conservancy projects, applying more fertilizer, improving cultivation techniques, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests are all important methods to increase yield per unit area, but they must be adapted to local conditions and implemented specifically. Irrigated cotton fields can yield 50% to 100% more than dry land; replacing with improved varieties can also increase production by 10% to 50% or more; increasing the application of appropriate fertilizers, fully cultivating soil fertility, improving cultivation techniques, and thoroughly preventing and controlling diseases and pests are necessary conditions for striving for high yields. Cotton is a cash crop with high value. One more jin of ginned cotton is equivalent to eight or nine jin of grain. As long as the yield increase measures adopted are reasonable and not wasteful, more labor and material costs will definitely yield considerable returns. Some high-yield models in Hebei Province last year specifically calculated the accounts, which proved this point.

　　Question: In recent years, the cotton-grain price ratio and cotton pre-purchase contract methods implemented in various regions have been very successful. I heard that the Soviet Union also has a cotton pre-purchase contract system. I wonder what the specific situation is? What is its direction of development?

　　Answer: Currently, Soviet agriculture is planned production. Cotton not only fully implements the contract system in procurement, but also the entire production process from the beginning of production to the harvest is fully implemented by state procurement departments and collective farms. Therefore, various measures such as land preparation, sowing, fertilization, irrigation, and management are detailed in the contract with certain standards, and a certain inspection system is stipulated during the growth period. Based on the results of each inspection and the estimated cotton yield, the cooperative is guaranteed to distribute appropriate amounts of grain, daily-use industrial products, fertilizers and other materials or loans to farmers in a timely manner. According to the report of Soviet expert Lysenko: "The contract states that the cotton sowing depth should be 4-6 cm, and a certain density of plants per hectare should be maintained according to local conditions. The top dressing period should not be later than July 20, and topping and pruning should be carried out from July 20 to August 5, and defoliation should be carried out before September 20 to facilitate machine harvesting. It is also stipulated that inspections should be carried out in stages during the growth period, and materials and loans should be distributed in stages according to the cotton payment plan." In addition, the contract also stipulates a progressive reward method for excess production: "If a collective farm produces 600-1000 kg of cotton per hectare in excess of the original production base, the excess part will be purchased at 150% of the price; if it produces 1000-1500 kg of cotton per hectare, the excess part will be purchased at 200% of the price." Under the dual stimulus of guaranteed harvest and rewards for excess production, new record yields are constantly emerging, and general yields are also gradually increasing. This not only gives national cotton production accurate planning and guarantees the supply of industrial raw materials, but more importantly, promotes the increase of cotton yield per unit area. At the same time, it points out a clear direction for our cotton pre-purchase contract system.

　　关于棉花增产答读者问
    问：棉花单位面积产量的标准到底怎样？去年听说有个劳动模范要计划每亩出产一千斤，结果报上发表的又以六百多斤为最高纪录；同时又说平均产量每亩只有七、八十斤，相差何以有这么大？另外听说苏联每亩能产一千多斤。但究竟能产多少？请答复。
    答：棉花单位面积的产额，由于植棉的技术相当复杂，需要的工本较多，病虫灾害等也还不能很好地完全克服，因之，在各种不同的耕作条件下，生产量的出入是很大的。在我国目前的植棉基础上，种得坏的每亩只收一、二十斤甚至几斤籽棉，种得好的有收籽棉三百斤以上的，一般的约可收籽棉几十斤到一百多斤；每亩产到四、五百斤籽棉的，现在还是很少数，至于产六百斤以上更成为个别的现象。因此，把一个地区种的好的坏的平均起来，每亩就只有七、八十斤籽棉的样子，合皮棉二十几斤（三斤籽棉合一斤皮棉）。去年曾有劳动模范定出每亩产一千斤的计划，但没有实现。苏联的生产条件已高度发展，在合理的轮作制度和进步的植棉技术下，据报告已创造出每亩最高产到一九○○斤籽棉的纪录，这当然还不是一般的标准。不过从这里可以看出棉花增加单位面积产额的广阔的前途，也说明我国现在棉田产额的水平还非常低，是需要而且可能努力争取提高的。
    问：全国各地互助组纷纷提出棉花增产的竞赛，要促进棉花单位面积产量的增加，究竟有些什么最重要而具体的条件？假若过分耗费工本，以致成本加重，又是否与实际要求相符？
    答：增进棉花单位面积产额，有些什么是最重要而具体的条件？这要根据各地棉花栽培上实际存在的问题，从总结群众的经验与科学技术相结合的基础上，决定各地区切要而适当的措施；在现有耕作基础上，逐步改进提高。一般说来，改良棉种、兴修水利、多施肥料、提高耕作技术、防治病虫害，都是增加单位面积产额的重要办法，但必须因时因地制宜，具体掌握实施。如有灌溉的棉田，可比旱地增收五成到一倍以上；换用良种也可增产百分之十到五十以上；增施适当的肥料、充分培养地力，提高栽培技术，彻底防治病虫害，更是争取高度丰产所必要的条件。棉花是经济作物，价值很高，多收一斤皮棉就合到八、九斤粮食，只要采用的增产措施是合理的，不是浪费的，多花工本是一定能得到相当的代价的。去年河北省有些创造高产量的典型，曾具体算过账，都证明了这一点。
    问：年来各地实施的棉粮比价与棉花预购合同办法，十分成功。听说苏联也有棉花预购合同的制度，不知道具体情况怎样？它的发展方向又如何？
    答：目前苏联农业是计划性的生产，棉花不仅在收购上全部执行合同制度，即自生产开始，直至收获为止的整个生产过程，国家收购部门与集体农庄，也完全实行合同办法。所以在生产过程中，整地、播种、施肥、灌溉、管理等各种措施，都在合同内详细订有一定标准，生育期间并订有一定的检查制度。根据各次的检查结果及棉花估计产量，保证经由合作社适时配售给农民适量的粮食、日用工业品及肥料等物资或贷款。据苏联专家卢森科报告：“在合同内记明棉花播种深度为四——六公分，并应按各地条件每公顷应保持一定株数的密度。施用追肥期不得晚于七月二十日，由七月二十日——八月五日实行摘心整枝等工作，并为便利机器收获起见，在九月二十日前要施行打叶。并规定在生育期间分期检查，按照缴付棉花计划分期配售物资及贷款。”此外合同内并定有超额产量的累进奖励办法：“集体农庄，如每公顷在原生产基数上超额生产棉花六——一○公担者，超额部分按百分之一百五十计价收购；超产一○——一五公担者，超额部分按百分之二百计价。”在收获有保障、超产有奖励的双重刺激下，新纪录的产额不断出现，一般的也逐步提高。如此不但使全国棉花生产具有准确的计划性，保证了工业原料的供应，更重要的促进了棉花单位面积的增产。同时给予我们的棉花预购合同制度也指出了明确的方向。
