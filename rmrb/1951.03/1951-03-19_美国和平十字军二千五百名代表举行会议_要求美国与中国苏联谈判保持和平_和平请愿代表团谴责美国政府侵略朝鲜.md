Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 17th: According to TASS, 2,500 representatives from various parts of the United States participating in the "American Peace Crusade" held a meeting here on the 15th. Speakers at the meeting demanded that peace be maintained and that negotiations be held with the Soviet Union and China. The American black singer Paul Robeson stated: "When we talk about peace, we mean that peace should be maintained between the United States and the Soviet Union and China. Therefore, we ask the government to negotiate with the Soviet Union and China. Although American capitalists are prepared to launch a war to slaughter a billion people in order to earn more profits, the American people have taken on the task of creating peace."

Lovett, chairman of the "American Peace Crusade," declared: "Any country, if its borders are threatened like China's, cannot ignore it." Robinson, a representative who attended the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, said: The people of Eastern European countries "oppose war and all measures leading to war. The people of Eastern Europe believe that the American people will definitely draw up a plan to defend peace."

Participating in the peace petition in Washington were about 300 trade union leaders representing the National Labor Conference for Peace, about 500 members of the American Women for Peace Association, Pyllinsky, the general secretary of the American Slav Congress and other American Slavs, a group from the Labor Youth League, representatives from the American Jewish Labor Council and the "American Veterans for Peace" association, and a youth delegation composed of students from Cornell University and other universities and secondary schools in New York City.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The "American Peace Crusade" sent a delegation on the 15th to demand that the U.S. government and members of Congress defend peace. According to TASS, Washington: On the evening of the 15th, the American Peace Crusade delegation met with Russell, Director of the Public Affairs Department of the State Department, representing Secretary of State Acheson, and submitted a peace petition. The delegation strongly protested against the arbitrary behavior of the United States in Korea, China, and Germany, and urged the State Department to make the "Kaesong Foreign Ministers' Meeting its primary responsibility to the American people." Lovett, chairman of the "Peace Crusade," stated: "In the atomic age, negotiation is the only way to achieve peace, and all other methods are bound to fail in the end. Self-righteousness, military power, and economic superiority are not enough to replace mutually compromising discussions." Lovett urged Acheson to "make every effort not to miss any opportunity or possibility for comprehensive negotiations with the Soviet Union and the new Chinese government," and emphasized that "recognizing the necessity and possibility of peaceful coexistence is the primary thing in current diplomacy."

In response, Russell read a lengthy statement to the delegation, reiterating the official policy of aggression and, as usual, falsely blaming the current tense international situation on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Robeson retorted to the representative of the U.S. State Department: Britain has a long history of colonies, and Belgium has established its colonial power at the expense of fifty million blacks, so how can Britain or Belgium be called "free countries"? Robeson emphasized that the eight million blacks in the Union of South Africa do not enjoy any freedom, and the fifteen million blacks in the United States do not have full civil rights.

Another delegation of the "Peace Crusade" went to the U.S. Department of Defense to petition, but was unreasonably refused a meeting by U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall, and only an assistant accepted the delegation's statement condemning U.S. interference in Korea.

Some members of the U.S. House of Representatives also refused to meet with the peace petition representatives. Morano, a Democratic congressman from Connecticut, even arrogantly ordered the police to drive them out of his office.

After returning from petitioning the State Department, Bao Lang, a leader of the American Women for Peace Association, stated: Russell's reply was "a defense of war. His words did not indicate any genuine intention to mediate for peace. The State Department must realize that the American people are demanding peace."

The famous American atomic scientist Morrison declared at a press conference: The Peace Crusade movement is a prelude to a larger conference planned to be held in Chicago on June 1st.

The "National Peace Crusade Committee" announced on the afternoon of the 15th that 2,500 representatives from 36 states had registered to participate.

　　美国和平十字军二千五百名代表举行会议
    要求美国与中国苏联谈判保持和平
    和平请愿代表团谴责美国政府侵略朝鲜
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国各地参加“美国和平十字军”的二千五百名代表，于十五日在此间举行会议。在会议上发言的人要求保持和平并与苏联及中国举行谈判。美国黑人歌唱家罗伯逊发言称：“当我们谈到和平的时候，我们的意思就是说，美国和苏联及中国之间要保持和平。因此，我们要求政府和苏联及中国进行谈判。尽管美国的资本家们准备发动战争来屠杀十亿人民，以求赚取更多的利润，但是，美国人民已经担负起缔造和平的任务。”
    “美国和平十字军”主席劳维特宣称：“任何国家，如果它的边境像中国的边境一样受到威胁，也是同样不能置之不理的。”曾出席华沙第二届世界和平大会的代表罗宾逊说：东欧各国的人民“反对战争和一切走向战争的措施。东欧人民相信美国人民必将订出保卫和平的计划来。”
    参加华盛顿的和平请愿的，有代表全国劳工和平会议的工会领袖约三百人，美国妇女争取和平协会会员约五百人，美国斯拉夫人大会总书记皮林斯基及其他美籍斯拉夫人，劳动青年联盟小组，美国犹太劳工会议和“美国退役军人争取和平”协会的代表，以及由康奈尔大学与其他大学和纽约市各中等学校的学生组成的青年代表团等。
    【新华社十七日讯】“美国和平十字军”已于十五日派出代表团向美国政府及议员要求保卫和平。据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国和平十字军代表团于十五日晚会见了美国国务卿艾奇逊代表、国务院公共事务司司长鲁塞尔，递交以和平请愿书。代表团猛烈抗议美国在朝鲜、中国和德国的专横行为，并力促国务院把“开成外长会议作为对美国人民的首要责任”。“和平十字军”主席劳维特称：“在原子时代中，谈判是达到和平的唯一途径，其他一切办法终究必归失败。自以为是、军事的威力、经济的优势都不足以代替互相让步的商讨。”劳维特敦促艾奇逊“尽一切努力不要放过任何与苏联和新中国政府进行全盘谈判的机会和可能性”，并强调称：“承认和平共处的必要与可能，是当前外交上的首要事情”。
    鲁塞尔在答复时向代表团宣读了冗长的声明，重述了官方的侵略政策，像往常一样胡说八道地把目前紧张的国际局势归罪于苏联及各人民民主国家。
    罗伯逊反问美国务院的代表称：英国具有年深日久的殖民地的历史，比利时也以五千万人的黑为牺牲而建立了殖民地的势力，那么如何能称英国或比利时为“自由国家”呢？罗伯逊强调指出：南非联邦八百万的黑人都享受不到任何自由，而美国一千五百万的黑人也没有充分的公民权利。
    “和平十字军”另一代表团赴美国防部请愿，但是遭到美国防部部长马歇尔无理拒见，仅由一名助手接受代表团关于谴责美国干涉朝鲜的声明。
    美国某些众院议员也拒绝会见和平请愿代表，民主党康涅狄格州众议员莫兰诺竟横暴地指使警察将他们逐出其办公室。
    美国妇女争取和平协会领导人巴奥朗在赴国务院请愿归来后声称：鲁塞尔的答复是“替战争辩护。他的话并未表示有真正和平调解的意思。国务院必须认识到美国人民是要求和平的”。
    美国著名的原子科学家摩里逊在记者招待会上宣称：和平十字军运动是计划于六月一日在芝加哥举行的更为盛大的会议的前奏。
    “全国和平十字军委员会”于十五日下午宣布：已有三十六州的二千五百名代表报名参加。
