　　British Force Labor in Malaya
    Youths of All Ethnic Groups in Malaya Strongly Oppose
    【Xinhua News Agency, 4th】Singapore News: In order to intensify the suppression of the Malayan national liberation movement, British imperialism is forcing Malayan men into military service. The British colonial authorities in Malaya issued a "Manpower Mobilization Order" in January, stipulating the conscription of 20,000 Malayan youths into "security forces," and began universal registration of people of all ethnic groups (including overseas Chinese youths) in Malaya between the ages of 18 and 24, in order to "conscript" them at any time. After the issuance of this "Manpower Mobilization Order," it was immediately strongly opposed by youths of all ethnic groups in Malaya. A large number of youths fleeing conscription went to the "Immigration Bureau" to apply for departure passports. Students abandoned their studies and left. In a school in Kuala Lumpur, out of 400 students aged 17 or older, 150 had left school for other places, 110 had dropped out, and another 40 were applying for certificates of completion in preparation for leaving school. In Singapore, young people distributed leaflets on the streets and alleys at night calling for resistance to the "Mobilization Order."

　　英在马来亚强征壮丁
    马来亚各族青年强烈反对
    【新华社四日讯】新加坡消息：英帝国主义为了加紧镇压马来亚民族解放运动，正强征马来亚壮丁服兵役。马来亚英殖民当局于一月间颁布一项“人力动员令”，规定征调两万名马来亚青年编入“保安队伍”，并开始普遍登记十八岁至二十四岁的马来亚各族人民（包括华侨青年），以便随时“征召”。这个“人力动员令”发出后，立即遭到马来亚各族青年的强烈反对。大批逃避兵役的青年到“移民局”申请离境护照。学生们纷纷放弃学业出走。在吉隆坡一所学校里，四百名年龄在十七岁以上的学生中有一百五十名已离校他往，一百一十名已经退学，另有四十名正申请修业证书，准备离校。在新加坡，青年们晚间街头巷尾散发号召抵制“动员令”的传单。
