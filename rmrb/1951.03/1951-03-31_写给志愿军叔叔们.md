A letter to the editor

　　To the Volunteer Army Uncles
    From Sun Yi, a member of the Young Pioneers

Dearest Volunteer Army Uncles:

    We were overjoyed to see Comrade Yu Chunhai's letter to us in the People's Daily on March 23rd. We read that letter over and over again, and we can almost recite it from memory. The words in the letter moved us to tears. We know that there are millions of Volunteer Army Uncles who love us even on the frozen and snowy battlefields. For our safety, for our future happiness, you are fighting the American invading army with iron will.

    A few days ago, returned representatives of the Volunteer Army reported on your heroic combat deeds at the front. The audience proudly said, "You represent the Chinese people's diligence and bravery, and you inspire the people of the whole country." The entire Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea is unfolding enthusiastically, and even monks, nuns, and Taoists, who have been detached from worldly affairs for many years, have participated in demonstrations. The workers and farmers in the rear are working hard to produce and support you. We hope that you will eliminate that group of invading beasts as soon as possible, so that people all over the world can live peaceful and happy lives.

    We will definitely study hard and firmly remember your spirit of bravely defending the country. Although we are still young and cannot take on major tasks, we are determined to be good children of the era of Chairman Mao.

    Wishing you victory in battle and good health. Sending you the salute of the Young Pioneers!

             Sun Yi, Member of the Young Pioneers, Second Central Primary School, Third District, Beijing

　　写给志愿军叔叔们
    少年儿童队队员孙毅亲爱的志愿军叔叔们：
    在三月二十三日的人民日报上看见了于春海同志给我们的信，我们高兴极啦。我们拿着那封信念了又念，差不多都会背了。信里的话使我们激动得流下了眼泪。我们知道：有千万个志愿军叔叔们，在冰天雪地的战场上还热爱着我们。你们为了我们的安全，为我们将来的幸福，用钢铁一样的意志，和美国侵略军队打仗。
    前几天，归国志愿军代表报告了你们在前方英勇战斗的事迹。听众们都骄傲地说：“你们代表了中国人民的勤劳和勇敢的气概，你们鼓励了全国人民”。全中国人民的抗美援朝运动正在热烈展开，连多年不问世事的和尚、尼姑、道士，都参加了游行示威。后方的工人、农民伯伯、叔叔们都在努力生产，支援着你们。希望你们早日消灭那群侵略野兽，使全世界人民过着和平、幸福的好日子。
    我们一定好好学习，把你们英勇卫国的精神牢牢记在脑子里。我们现在虽然年纪小，还不能担任重大的任务；可是我们有决心做毛主席时代的好儿童。
    祝你们战斗胜利，身体健康。向你们致少年儿童队的敬礼
             北京市三区第二中心小学少年儿童队队员  孙毅
