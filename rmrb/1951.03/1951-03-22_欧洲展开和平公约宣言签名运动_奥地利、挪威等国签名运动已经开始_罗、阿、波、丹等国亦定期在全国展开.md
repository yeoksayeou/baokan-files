Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Peace fighters in several European countries are actively preparing and launching signature campaigns for the Peace Pact Declaration. Sadoveanu, Chairman of the Romanian Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace, announced on the 14th that Romania is scheduled to launch a nationwide signature campaign for the Peace Pact Declaration in early April. The Albanian Committee for the Defense of Peace has also decided to launch a nationwide signature campaign starting April 12th. The Executive Committee of the Polish National Committee for the Defense of Peace held a meeting in Warsaw on the 14th. The meeting resolved to call on local peace committees to widely publicize the resolutions of the World Peace Council, and to call on the working people to deeply develop the patriotic movement and step up the construction of the Six-Year Plan. At peace conferences held by the Polish working people in various places, they have pledged to support the Peace Pact Declaration with their production achievements. In Austria, the signature campaign began on the 15th, and at least half of the workers in industrial enterprises in the capital, Vienna, have signed the declaration. Many workers are using their spare time to collect signatures everywhere. A large number of Social Democrats bravely signed the declaration despite the threats and intimidation of right-wing leaders. The Austrian Democratic Women's Federation has called on women across the country to actively participate in the signature campaign. Norway launched the signature campaign on the 17th. Among the first to sign the declaration were former Prime Minister Hornsrood, Supreme Court Judge Dahl, and many famous writers, artists, scientists, educators, and clergy. The Danish Peace Committee held an enlarged meeting in Copenhagen on the 19th, and the meeting decided to launch a signature campaign throughout the country. Local peace committees in France are now sending representatives to deliver the resolutions passed by local peace conferences, which demand the conclusion of a peace pact, to the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference currently being held in Paris.
