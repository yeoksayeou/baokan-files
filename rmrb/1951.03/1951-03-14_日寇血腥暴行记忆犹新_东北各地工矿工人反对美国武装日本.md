Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 12th: Workers in various industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, who suffered fourteen years of brutal rule by the Japanese bandits, are vehemently denouncing the bloody atrocities of the Japanese bandits and firmly opposing the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan.

Around 1941, the Japanese bandits seized more than 100,000 people from Northeast China, North China, and East China and sent them to work in the Fuxin Coal Mine in western Liaoning Province. Before the "August 15th" liberation, most of the captured workers died miserably from overwork, hunger, and cold. In the southern suburbs of the Haizhou branch of the Fuxin Coal Mine, more than 50,000 grave mounds can still be seen today. It is said that some graves contain twenty or thirty people. Worker Chen Jinhai pointed to these grave mounds and said indignantly: "Of the twenty-seven fellow villagers who were captured from Hangzhou by the Japanese devils with me, sixteen are buried there, and some of their bodies were even eaten by dogs." Hou Wanting, a coal miner who was recently promoted to deputy pit chief, denounced the atrocities of the Japanese bandits: "The Japanese devils did not treat the Chinese as human beings. They forced us to dig coal in places that were about to collapse, and many people were crushed to death inside. If workers got sick, they were still forced to work or dragged into the dead-man warehouse. At that time, more than a dozen large carts were pulling dead people out every day."

During the period of Japanese bandit rule, in every pit of the Dalizi Iron Mine in Liaodong Province, there were special agents supervising and whipping the workers to perform arduous labor all day long. The workers ate rancid noodles, barely enough to half fill them, and lived in damp, leaky shacks. Every day, people died from freezing, starvation, and disease. More than 30,000 workers were persecuted and slaughtered by the Japanese bandits. Gong Desheng, an old worker at the Dalizi Iron Mine, said with gnashing teeth, "Of the three hundred and forty-seven people who were captured with me, I am the only one still alive. I escaped after being beaten countless times by the Japanese devils. Whoever helps the Japanese devils rise again, I will demand this blood debt from them." Hu Deren came to the mine with sixty-five people, and now only four of his family members, including his mother and himself, are left. His father and brother were also tortured to death. When Hu Deren's old mother heard that the United States was plotting to rearm Japan, she angrily said that she would fight the American devils with her old life.

The atrocities of the Japanese bandits in poisoning Chinese workers are endless. During the construction of the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station, which began in 1937, six to seven thousand arrested patriotic youths and workers sacrificed themselves under inhumane overwork and brutal whippings. In a gas explosion in the Liutang coal tunnel of the Benxi Coal Mine, more than 3,000 workers were suffocated to death because the Japanese bandits blocked the air vents. Workers in various places, in denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese bandits, unanimously expressed their firm opposition to the U.S. imperialists' vicious crime of separately concluding a peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan.

### 日寇血腥暴行记忆犹新  东北各地工矿工人反对美国武装日本

　　日寇血腥暴行记忆犹新
    东北各地工矿工人
    反对美国武装日本
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】曾受日寇十四年残暴统治的东北各工矿企业的工人纷纷控诉日寇血腥暴行，坚决反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋。
    一九四一年前后，日寇从东北、华北、华东等地抓了十多万人，送往辽西省阜新煤矿去作工。在“八一五”光复以前，被抓来的工人大都在过度劳动与饥寒交迫下惨死。阜新煤矿海州分矿南郊，至今尚可看到五万多个坟堆，据说有的一个坟堆里埋着二、三十个人。工人陈金海指着这些坟堆激愤地说：“和我一起从杭州被日本鬼子抓来的二十七个同乡，埋在那里的就有十六个，还有的尸身都被狗吃了。”最近由刨煤工人提升为副坑长的侯万廷控诉日寇暴行说：“日本鬼子不把中国人当人看待，硬逼着我们到眼看就要坍塌的场子里去挖煤，很多人被压死在里边。工人生了病还要强迫做工，或者被拖进死人仓库。那时，每天有十几辆大车往外拉死人。”
    在日寇统治时期，辽东省大栗子铁矿每一坑间都有特务监督，鞭打着工人整日作苛重劳动。工人们吃的是腐臭面，只能吃个半饱，住的是阴湿破漏的麻棚，每天都有因冻饿及疾病致死的。惨遭日寇迫害与屠杀的工人先后达三万余名。大栗子铁矿老工人宫得胜切齿痛恨地说：“我们一起被抓来的三百四十七个人，现在活着的只有我一个。我是遭受日本鬼子无数次毒打后逃出来的。谁帮助日本鬼子再起，我就要向谁讨还这笔血债。”和工人胡德仁一起到该矿的有六十五个人，现在只剩他母子四口，他的父亲和哥哥也都是被折磨死的。胡德仁的老母亲听说美国阴谋重新武装日本，激怒地表示她要和美国鬼子拚老命。
    日寇荼毒中国工人的暴行是诉说不尽的。一九三七年开始抢修小丰满水力发电站的工程中，曾有六、七千被捕的爱国青年及工人在非人的过度劳动及残酷的鞭笞下牺牲。本溪煤矿柳塘煤洞发生的一次瓦斯爆炸事件中，因日寇堵塞了风口，闷死了三千多工人。各地工人在痛诉日寇暴行中，一致表示坚决反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和、重新武装日本的恶毒罪行。
