    Beijing Public Security Bureau Sends Letter to This Newspaper
    Thanking Citizens for Reporting Special Agents
    Counter-Revolutionary Han Xihou Has Been Arrested

To the Esteemed Editor:

    On February 24th, we received your forwarded letter from citizens Di Zhenggang and Quan Buhuan, secretly reporting the criminal acts of Han Xihou, a special agent of the Japanese puppet gendarmerie and the Kuomintang gendarmerie. We immediately transferred it to our Fifth Branch for investigation. After repeated investigation, the facts were confirmed, and the special agent Han Xihou has now been arrested and detained.

    The criminal Han, whose real name is Han Xihou, also known as Han Dawu, served as a special agent for the Japanese gendarmerie in Tangshan during the Japanese occupation. He successively served as a translator, deputy team leader, and lieutenant captain in the gendarmerie, relying on the power of the Japanese puppets to persecute the people. On one occasion, he led Japanese gendarmes to arrest more than 20 ordinary people, some of whom were sent to the Northeast and other places as laborers, and some were buried alive. After the Japanese surrendered, he colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang, successively serving as adjutant of the puppet Beiping Security Police Headquarters and adjutant of the Shanhaiguan Great Wall Headquarters, continuing to do evil. After the liberation of Beijing, he still did not repent, but impersonated staff members of our organs, forged seals, bought and sold guns, and carried out counter-revolutionary activities in secret.

    In the course of carrying out the important task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, we have received many informant letters from citizens, and based on the clues in the informant letters, we have arrested many extremely heinous special agents. The righteous actions of Mr. Di Zhenggang and Mr. Quan Buhuan are one example of this.

    These facts also show that the political consciousness of the masses has been raised, and also show that the masses are closely cooperating with the government to expose special agents. This force is great. In addition to expressing our sincere thanks to Mr. Di Zhenggang, Mr. Quan Buhuan, and others who helped us solve this case, we hope that the people of the whole city will further assist the government in rectifying counter-revolutionary criminals in order to protect the safety of the lives and property of the vast number of people and consolidate the social order of the people's democracy.

                                         Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau

    北京市公安局致函本报
    感谢市民告发特务
    反革命分子韩锡厚已予逮捕编辑同志：
    二月二十四日接到你们转来的市民邸正刚、全不换密告日伪宪兵特务、国民党宪兵特务韩锡厚犯罪行为的信件，当即转我处五分局调查，经反复调查属实，现已将特务罪犯韩锡厚逮捕管押。
    韩犯本名韩锡厚，又名韩大五，日寇占领时期在唐山充日寇宪兵队特务，先后曾任宪兵队翻译、队副及中尉队长，依仗日伪势力残害人民。有一次他带领日本宪兵抓走老百姓二十多人，有的送往东北等地当劳工，有的就被活埋了。日寇投降后，他与国民党匪帮相勾结，先后任伪北平保警总队副官及山海关长城总队副官等职，继续作恶。北京解放后，他仍不改悔，竟冒充我机关工作人员，伪造印信，买卖枪枝，潜伏进行反革命活动。
    我们在执行镇压反革命的重要任务当中，收到了市民很多的告密信，并且根据告密信的线索，逮捕了很多的罪大恶极的特务。邸正刚、全不换先生等正义行为即是其中一个例子。
    从这些事实也说明了群众的政治觉悟提高了。也说明了群众密切与政府合作检举特务，这个力量是伟大的。我们除向给我们破获此案以帮助的邸正刚、全不换先生等谨致谢意外，并望全市人民进一步协助政府整饬反革命罪犯，以保卫广大人民生命财产的安全及巩固人民民主社会秩序。
                                         北京市人民政府公安局
