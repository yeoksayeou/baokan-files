　　A Brief Discussion on Seed Vernalization
    ——One of China's Great Inventions in Agricultural Science——
    Le Tianyu
    Our beloved motherland has a glorious history of inventions in natural science, making great contributions to world civilization. Especially in agricultural science, with nearly five thousand years of records, it represents the world's earliest and most important scientific inventions. For example, Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs, identifying the five grains, creating the plow and hoe, and inventing cultivation, marked the beginning of mankind's utilization and transformation of nature. Shennong's "Shennong's Materia Medica," which has been passed down to this day, remains a classic document in both agricultural and medical fields. Globally speaking, this is indeed the earliest book on botanical literature. This is something worth greatly publicizing. Another example is the female inventor Leizu Xiling, who initiated sericulture and cocoon reeling for clothing purposes. Wang Zhen's Book of Agriculture states: "Xiling initiated the encouragement of silkworm farming, bathing the seeds when the constellation Antares rose, and the lady herself took care of the mulberry trees, thus presenting the merit of cocoon reeling, silk spinning, and weaving, which led to widespread weaving to provide clothing for suburban and court ceremonies." The invention of sericulture also originated in China, with a history of over four thousand years. Even today, China's silk industry still holds a superior position worldwide. Furthermore, there are many heroes of agricultural science inventions, such as the world-renowned invention of tea, the invention of agricultural irrigation, as well as the invention of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, which were not only invented very early but also hold considerable significance today. This article will only briefly describe the invention of seed vernalization to illustrate the origins of China's agricultural science.

    The invention of vernalization of crops, which caused a sensation worldwide, originated in China. Works such as Jia Sixie's "Essential Skills for the Common People" of the Later Wei Dynasty have already referred to this method as described in ancient books (such as the records in the Book of Fan Shengzhi about using snow juice to treat seeds, resulting in doubled harvests). The ancient methods passed down in rural areas are still being promoted and applied in vast areas of Northwest China and individual inland regions today, and even women and children can master them. This is a genuine ancient method.

    The term "vernalization" is a modern scientific term from the Soviet Union. In our motherland's ancient times, it was called "cuiqing" (forcing green). Cuiqing still possesses the content of modern science today and is widely applied. It not only shortens the growing season of crops and promotes development in plant seeds but also employs similar cuiqing techniques in animal eggs, such as silkworm egg cuiqing. This involves controlling the developmental stages of organisms, directing them to develop according to the time (such as sowing winter wheat in spring) and space (such as transplanting temperate plants to frigid zones) desired by humans, and improving their quality and yield.

    In ancient China, vernalization methods were first used for the five grains, such as the "spring sowing method for autumn wheat" prevalent in the Northwest region. Later, it was gradually applied to vegetables and other crops as a technique to increase resistance and improve yield, such as the "winter-staying eight-petal garlic" of Taihang, the "smothered millet" of northern Shaanxi, and the "seed-寄谷 (Ji Zi Gu)" of Chahar and Suiyuan.

    China has the most types of vernalization methods. Taking wheat as an example, the oldest method prevalent in the Taihang region involves mixing seeds with snow water after the winter solstice (in areas such as Shexian, Wu'an, Huixian, and Linxian) for a total of forty-nine days, called "seven-seven" wheat. In some places, wheat is soaked in a well on the winter solstice, once every seven days, for a total of nine times, called "seven-nine" wheat. Furthermore, China's "rural giant" created the "natural vernalization method," sowing wheat in the soil when the ground is frozen, called "frozen yellow." Additionally, seeds are sown after the winter solstice and covered with snow, called "smothered wheat." There is also the method of placing wheat in jars and burying them upside down in the soil, called the "jar burial method." All these vernalization methods are creations of the highly cultivated and wise farmers of our country. This is something that can be boasted to the world.

    Since Academician Lysenko of the Soviet Union elucidated the theory of "vernalization," the term "vernalization" has caused a sensation worldwide. Scientific monopolists in the United States wrote some articles claiming that vernalization was invented in the United States, but they have no factual basis for their claims. These boastful articles will be self-defeating when placed before the inventive achievements of our country from ancient times to the present.

    Our great motherland has thousands of years of scientific inventions and the superior conditions of vast land and abundant resources. What is even more gratifying is the leadership of Mao Zedong's scientific thought, which enables our country's many great inventions to be further improved.

　　略谈种子春化法
    ——我国在农业科学上的伟大发明之一——
    乐天宇
    我们可爱的祖国，在自然科学的发明上，曾有了很光辉的历史，对于世界的文明，有了伟大的贡献。特别在农业科学方面，有近五千年的记录，为全世界最早最重要的科学发明。例如神农氏尝百草、辨五谷、作耒耜、发明栽培等，实为人类利用自然改造自然的开始。神农氏的《神农本草经》，流传到今天，仍是农医两科的经典文献。就全世界来说，关于植物学的原始文献，这确是最早的一本书。这是值得大大宣扬的一件事。又如女发明家嫘祖西陵氏，创始养蚕治茧，供衣着之用。王桢农书说：“西陵氏始劝蚕事，月大火而浴种，夫人副褘而躬桑，乃献茧称丝织纴之功，因之广织以供郊朝之服。”蚕桑的发明，亦以我国为最早，有四千余年的历史。即就今天来说，我国的蚕丝业在全世界上仍占有优等的地位。更有很多农业科学的发明英雄，如世界著明的茶叶的发明、农田水利的发明，以及畜牧兽医等等的发明，不但发明甚早，而且今天都还有相当的地位。本文仅就种子春化法的发明，略加记述，以见我国农业科学的渊源。
    轰动世界的农作物种子春化法的发明，在全世界来说，当以我国为最早。后魏贾氏齐民要述等著作已称此法为古籍所述（如汜胜之书以雪汁治种，则收常倍等等的记载）。即在农村中所传的古法，到今天仍在广大的西北地区以及个别内地推行应用，而且妇女孺子都能掌握，这是一个地道的古法。
    春化二字，是苏联的现代科学名词，在我们祖国的古代，名为催青。催青，到今天仍具有现代科学的内容，而且是很普遍地被应用着。不但在植物种子方面缩短农作物的生长期，促进发育，就是在动物的种卵方面，也有同样的催青技术，例如蚕子催青等。这就是控制生物的发育阶段，使它有定向的按照人类所需的时间（如秋麦春种）和空间（如温带植物经寒带移种）而发育，并提高其品质和产量。
    我国古代的春化法最先用于五谷，如通行西北地区的“秋麦春种法”。后来渐渐应用到蔬菜及其它的农作物上，作为增加抵抗力，提高产量的技术，如太行的“住冬八瓣蒜”，陕北的“闷谷”，察绥的“寄籽谷”等等。
    春化法的种类，以我国为最多。即以小麦而论，最古流传的是太行区，在冬至后用雪水拌种（涉县、武安、辉县、林县等地），共拌四十九天，称为“七七”小麦。又个别地方，在冬至日将小麦浸在井中，每隔七天一次，共浸九次，称为“七九”小麦。又有我国的“农村巨人”特创的“自然春化法”，在地冻时将小麦播在土中，称为“冻黄”。又在冬至后将种子播下，使雪覆盖，称为“闷麦”。此外又有用缸盛麦，倒置埋在土中，称为“罐埋法”。凡此种种春化方法，都是我国有高度耕作智慧的农民群众的创作。这是可以夸耀于全世界的。
    自从苏联李森科院士阐明“春化作用”的理论以后，“春化作用”的名词，轰动了全世界。美国的科学垄断者，写了一些文章，说春化法是美国发明的，但他们毫无发明事迹的根据。他们这些吹牛的文章，只要摆在我国从古到今的发明事迹面前，其虚伪性就不攻自破了。
    我们伟大的祖国有了几千年的科学发明，及地大物博的优越条件，而更可庆幸的是有了毛泽东科学思想的领导，使我国许多伟大的发明能更进一步的提高。
