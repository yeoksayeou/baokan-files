A Major Task in Rural Branch Work
    ——Strengthening Basic Knowledge Education for Party Members
    ——Commentary on Branch Work
    The Party School of the Zhengding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party once conducted a test on the basic knowledge of the Party for the Party members participating in the study. A total of sixty people participated in this test, most of whom were village branch committee members. From this test, it can be seen that most comrades understand the nature and basic tasks of the Party. For example, most people were able to answer correctly the question "The Communist Party of China is the party of the working class, it represents the interests of the working class, and also represents the interests of all the people"; only thirteen people answered incorrectly the question "The proposition of the Communist Party of China for the Chinese revolution is to first realize New Democracy at the present stage; and in the future, to realize socialism." However, this test also reflected a problem: some people are not very clear about some specific issues. For example, in answering the question "What is the revolutionary task of China at the present stage?" five people answered "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country," sixteen people answered "Economic construction, getting rich," some answered "Lead the masses, complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities," some answered "Hold meetings on time, pay Party dues," and some answered "Suppress reactionary landlords and saboteurs." Some people even said when answering "What are the rights and obligations of a Party member?" that "Attending Party member meetings, having the right to call people," "Paying Party dues"...
    As far as we know, this phenomenon is not only present in Zhengding County, but also in other regions. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered the same phenomenon in the training of organizers: among 132 students, 20% did not know the content of the Party Program and Party Constitution in the past, and seven of them had never even read the Party Constitution. Other Party members had only read it roughly. Therefore, there was a phenomenon of misunderstanding "the interests of the Party are above all else" as "the interests of Party members are above all else," or calling the Party "the party of poor and lower-middle peasants."
    This shows that a small number of rural Party members do not have a sufficient understanding of some basic knowledge of the Party. Some people have been in the Party for a long time, but they still do not know the ultimate goal of the Party—to realize the communist system in China. Or some Party members know this ultimate goal, but do not know its actual content. Therefore, some people mistakenly regard the current New Democratic society as a communist society; some people mistakenly regard overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and dividing the land as the ultimate goal of the revolution; and some people mistakenly regard the agricultural socialist ideas of peasants "eating from the same pot" and "equalizing land distribution" as the implementation of a communist society. Therefore, these people inevitably made left-leaning mistakes that harmed the interests of middle peasants in their work; and this kind of erroneous behavior still continues sporadically in different regions. Or some people think that the revolution has been successful, and a passive retirement idea of "retiring to the countryside" and "living a pastoral life" has emerged.
    Some Party members, although they know a lot about the current central tasks, such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, protecting their homes and defending the country, and suppressing counter-revolutionary elements; they can also actively complete these tasks. However, they do not understand the Party's overall task at the present stage. Therefore, when they implement policies, they only know what to do, but do not know why. Consequently, they vacillate between left and right in their work. On the other hand, it reflects that the cadre's purely task-oriented view is very serious, and it is from top to bottom. When superiors assign tasks to subordinates, they do not explain the significance of the task clearly; subordinates also do not seriously study the tasks assigned by superiors; even if they study, they often neglect to combine it with the overall task.
    Another serious problem is that a small number of Party members do not even know the rights and obligations of a Party member that must be followed. In this way, a Party member naturally cannot meet the requirements of the Party Constitution——"Strive to improve their ideological awareness and understanding of the basics of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought"; "Strictly abide by Party discipline, actively participate in the political life of the Party and the domestic revolutionary movement, practically implement the Party's policies and the resolutions of the Party organization, and fight against all phenomena inside and outside the Party that harm the interests of the Party." Even if these people do it unconsciously, they are not firm and cannot withstand practical tests. This is one of the reasons why some Party organizations cannot become the core organizations in various movements and realize their leading role.
    Admittedly, the emergence of these phenomena is not accidental. These Party organizations were established in an environment of fierce national and class struggles. After these Party organizations were established, they were busy carrying out their main tasks—supporting the war and land reform. They did not have time to conduct systematic education on the basic knowledge of the Party for Party members. And Party members did not have time to systematically study the basic knowledge of the Party to improve their ideological awareness. However, after entering a peaceful construction environment, some Party organizations still did not use every opportunity to conduct systematic education on the basic knowledge of the Party for Party members. Although they had some objective difficulties—few cadres, a lot of work, and scattered branches—they were not insurmountable. The Yiyang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party establishing branch education dissemination stations is an example.
    These phenomena urgently need to be improved. Now many Party committees have paid attention to this work, and it proves that we have initially possessed the conditions to systematically improve the ideological awareness of Party members, and that this work of improving the ideological awareness of Party members is very necessary. The realization and completion of a policy and a task relies eighty or ninety percent on the ideological and political cultivation and training of cadres and Party members. Stalin once pointed out that in order to realize the correct political line, we need cadres, we need people who understand the Party's political line, accept it as their own line, are determined to realize it, are good at actually realizing it, are able to be responsible for it, are able to protect it, and are able to fight for it.
    Party organizations at all levels should realize ideologically that educating Party members on the basic knowledge of the Party is one of the main tasks of Party organizations at present.

### 农村支部工作中的一件大事——加强对党员的基本知识教育——支部工作述评

　　农村支部工作中的一件大事
    ——加强对党员的基本知识教育
    ——支部工作述评
    中共正定县委员会党校，曾对参加学习的党员，举行了一次有关党的基本知识的测验。参加这次测验的共有六十人，其中大部分为村支部委员。从这次测验中可以看到大部分同志对党的性质和基本任务是了解的。例如对“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，它代表工人阶级的利益，也代表全体人民的利益”一题大部能够答对；对“中国共产党对中国革命的主张，在现阶段，先实现新民主主义；将来，再实现社会主义”一题也只十三人答错。但是在这次测验中也反映出这样一个问题，有些人对一些具体问题还不大清楚，例如在答“中国现阶段的革命任务是什么”一题中，有五人答是“抗美援朝，保家卫国”，有十六人答是“经济建设，发家致富”，有的答是“领导群众，完成上级所分配的任务”，有的答是“按期开会，缴纳党费”，有的答是“镇压反动地主和破坏分子”。还有人在回答“党员有那些权利与义务”时，说成“开党员大会，有叫人的权利”，“缴纳党费”……
    据我们知道，此种现象，还不只是正定县存在，其他地区也有类似的情形。中共热河省委在训练组织员中就发现了同样现象：在一百三十二名学员中，有百分之二十过去是不知道党纲党章的内容，而其中有七名，甚至根本没有读过党章，其他党员也只是粗略地看过一遍，因此有把“党的利益高于一切”误解为是“党员的利益高于一切”，或把党叫做“贫雇农党”的现象。
    这就说明了现在有一小部分农村党员对于党的一些基本知识，了解得很不够。有些人虽然参加党已经很久，但还不知道党的最终目的——在中国实现共产主义制度。或者有些党员虽也知道这个最终目的，但并不知道其实在的内容。因此有些人把现在的新民主主义社会错当作共产主义社会；有些人把打倒蒋介石分得土地，错当作了革命的最终目的；有些人把农民“吃大锅饭”、“平分土地”的农业社会主义思想错当作这就是实行共产主义社会。因此这些人在工作中间不可避免地发生了损害中农利益的左倾错误；而且这种错误行为，至今还继续地零星地在不同地区发生着。或者有些人以为革命已经成功，产生了一种“告老还乡”、“过田园生活”的消极退休思想。
    有些党员，虽然对目前的中心任务知道得不少，例如抗美援朝，保家卫国，镇压反革命分子；也能积极地去完成这些任务。但他们不了解党在现阶段的总任务，因此他们在执行政策时，只知其然，而不知其所以然，在工作中也就发生了左右摇摆的现象。另一方面反映了干部单纯任务观点是非常严重的，而且是自上而下的，上级在给下级分配任务时，并不说清楚这一任务的意义；下级也不认真研究上级所分配的任务；即便研究，也常常忽视与总的任务相结合。
    再一个严重的问题，还有少数党员，对一个党员所必须奉行的党员的权利与义务都不知道。这样，一个党员自然不能够像党章上所要求的——“努力地提高自己的觉悟程度和领会马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础”；“严格地遵守党纪，积极参加党内的政治生活和国内的革命运动，实际执行党的政策和党的组织的决议，和党内党外一切损害党的利益的现象进行斗争”。即便这些人不自觉的作到了，也是不坚决的，经不起实际的考验。这就是有些党组织还不能成为各种运动中的核心组织、实现自己领导作用的一个原因。
    诚然，这些现象的产生并不是偶然的。这些党组织是在激烈的民族斗争与阶级斗争环境中建立起来的。这些党组织建立起来后忙于进行自己的主要工作——支援战争，土地改革。就没有时间来对党员进行系统的党的基本知识教育。而党员也没有时间来系统地学习党的基本知识，以提高自己的觉悟程度。但是以后，进入和平建设环境后，有些党组织仍没有利用一切时机来对党员进行系统的党的基本知识教育。虽然他们有些客观困难——干部少，工作多，支部分散，但并不是不能够克服的，中共昔阳一区委员会，建立支部教育传授站就是一个例证。
    这些现象是刻不容缓地需要加以改进。现在也已有不少党委注意了这一工作，并证明我们确已初步具备系统地提高党员思想觉悟程度的条件和这种提高党员的思想觉悟程度的工作是十分必要的。一个政策与一个任务的实现与完成，十分之八九要依靠干部党员的思想政治上的修养与锻炼。斯大林曾指出：为了实现正确政治路线，就需要有干部，就需要有懂得党的政治路线，把它当作自己的路线来接受，决意把他实现起来，善于切实把它实现起来，能够对他负责，能够保护它，能够为它而奋斗的人材。
    各级党组织，应该从思想上来认识，对党员进行党的基本知识的教育，是目前党组织的主要任务之一。
