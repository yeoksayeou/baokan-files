　　Expanding Native Produce and Mountain Product Exchange
    Central South Cooperative Adopts Contract Ordering Method
    The Central South region's provinces produce a wide variety of native produce and mountain goods. Henan has: sesame oil, peanuts, dates, tung oil, tobacco; Hunan has: rice, umbrellas, handmade paper; Hubei has: tobacco, cotton, homespun cloth; Jiangxi has: sugarcane, tea oil, peanuts, rice, sesame; Guangdong has: Chinese olives, sugarcane, gypsum, rosin, etc. For farmers in some native produce and specialty product areas, these goods are their primary economic source for maintaining their livelihoods. If they cannot be sold easily, it directly impacts their lives.

    In response to this situation, the cooperatives of various provinces and cities in the Central South region devoted themselves to exchanging native products in 1950 and achieved considerable success. For example, the Henan Provincial Cooperative Headquarters sold over 500,000 jin of sesame oil, soybeans, peanuts, dates, and tung oil to Wuhan, Shanghai, Wuxi, Hebei, and other places. The Jiangxi Provincial Cooperative Headquarters purchased yarn and salt worth a total of 5 billion yuan from Shanghai and inland areas, and exchanged sugar materials, rice, peanuts, tea oil, peanut cake, soybeans, and sesame worth 4 billion yuan with the Ganzhou and Nanchang prefectural cooperatives. The Hunan, Hubei, Wuhan, and Guangzhou cooperative headquarters also carried out a lot of exchange work, which played a significant role in promoting the sales of native produce and mountain products. However, due to the lack of business experience of the Central South Region Cooperative Affairs Bureau and the Central South provinces and cities cooperative headquarters, there were still many shortcomings in the promotion and exchange of native produce and mountain products. The most important of these was the failure to eliminate capitalist ideology in management, which hindered the implementation of the principle of "higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives; grassroots cooperatives serving members."

    Now, based on last year's experience, the Central South Region Cooperative Affairs Bureau and the provincial and municipal cooperatives have adopted the method of formulating plans for purchasing native produce and mountain products and signing contracts with each other according to the plans in organizing this year's exchange of native produce and mountain products. Cooperatives in various regions have further launched large-scale material exchanges through contracts. The Central South Cooperative Depot ordered 5,000 bundles of handmade paper, 6 million jin of medium-grade machine-milled rice, 2 million jin of tung oil, and 33,000 umbrellas from the Hubei Provincial Cooperative Headquarters; ordered 1 million jin of medium-grade machine-milled rice, 100,000 jin of tung oil, 50,000 jin of brown sugar, 10,000 jin of wood ear, and 6,000 bolts of native and foreign cloth from the Hubei Provincial Cooperative Headquarters; ordered 10,000 jin of wood ear, 5 million jin of wheat, and 1 million jin of soybeans from the Henan Provincial Cooperative Depot; and ordered 8,000 jin of slab sugar from the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative Headquarters. The Hubei Provincial Headquarters also ordered 60,000 jin of machine-made white sugar from the Wuhan Municipal Headquarters and the Guangdong Provincial Headquarters, and 200,000 jin of sesame oil from the Henan Provincial Headquarters. The Wuhan Municipal Headquarters in turn ordered 20,000 jin of brown sugar from the Jiangxi Provincial Headquarters, and the Jiangxi Provincial Headquarters exchanged 200 bundles of paper with the Hubei Provincial Headquarters for 5,000 dan of gypsum. This guarantees the sales channels for native produce and mountain products in various regions and drives private merchants to engage in purchasing and sales. (Feng Yun)

### 扩大土产山货交流  中南合作社采用合同订货办法

　　扩大土产山货交流
    中南合作社采用合同订货办法
    中南区各省所产的土产、山货的种类很多，在河南有：麻油、花生、枣、桐油、烟叶；湖南有：稻、雨伞、土纸；湖北有：烟叶、棉花、土布；江西有：甘蔗、茶油、花生、稻谷、芝麻；广东有：青果、甘蔗、石膏、松香等。这些土产和山货，在有些土产、特产区是农民们维持生活的主要经济来源，如不能畅销，则直接影响农民的生活。
    针对这一情况，中南区各省、市合作社，曾在一九五○年就致力于交流土产的工作，得到了相当成绩。如河南省合作总社曾向武汉、上海、无锡、河北等地推销麻油、黄豆、花生、枣子、桐油等五十万余斤。江西省合作总社曾由上海和内地采购纱布和食盐总值五十亿元，和赣州、南昌两专区社、交换了糖料、稻谷、花生、茶油、花生饼、黄豆和芝麻等四十亿元。湖南、湖北、武汉市、广州市等合作总社也做了不少交流工作，对土产、山货的推销起了很大的作用。不过，由于中南区合作事业管理局和中南各省、市合作总社业务经验不足，在推销与交流土产山货中，还存在着不少缺点。其中最主要的是，没有肃清经营中的资本主义思想，因而妨碍了“上级社为下级服务；基层社为社员服务”的方针的贯彻。
    现在，中南区合作事业管理局及各省、市社根据去年经验，在组织今年土产、山货交流中，采用了订定收购土产、山货的计划和根据计划相互订立合同的办法。各地合作社间通过合同进一步地展开了大规模的物资交换。中南合作货栈向湖北省合作总社订购了土纸五千篓、中等机米六百万斤、桐油二百万斤、雨伞三万三千把；向湖北省合作总社订购了中等机米一百万斤、桐油十万斤、红糖五万斤，木耳一万斤、土洋布六千匹；向河南省合作货栈订购了木耳一万斤、小麦五百万斤、黄豆一百万斤；向广东省合作总社订购了片糖八千斤。湖北省总社也向武汉市总社、广东省总社订购了机制白糖六万斤，向河南省总社订购了麻油二十万斤，武汉市总社又向江西省总社订购了红糖二万斤，江西省总社以纸二百篓与湖北省总社交换石膏五千担。这就保证了各地土产、山货的销路，并带动私商进行购销。（冯云）
