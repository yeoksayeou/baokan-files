Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th: The "People's Daily" published Kapov's letter from Paris under the title "The Voice of the People." Kapov pointed out that hundreds of millions of people around the world are paying great attention to the proceedings of the Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants Meeting. The firm voice of all countries, earnestly hoping to prevent another bloody war, has reached here, to the conference hall of the Rose Marble Palace. Every day, dozens of letters are sent to the Rose Marble Palace from various countries, from various groups and ordinary people. Although these people have very different political leanings and political beliefs, they are united in their determination to safeguard peace and stop war.

Kapov said that the Soviet delegation receives hundreds of letters every day, and anyone who reads these letters cannot help but be moved. Ordinary people in all countries believe that the Soviet delegation is a strong defender of peace. They believe that the Soviet representatives can do their utmost to strive for an agenda that can ensure the smooth progress of the foreign ministers' meeting and contribute to the cause of peace.

Kapov cited several letters as examples, all expressing deep gratitude to the Soviet Union for everything it has done to liberate Europe from the shackles of the fascist bandits, and for its timely proposal to prohibit the re-militarization of Germany. Kapov spoke in particular detail about a letter written to the Soviet delegation by the French General Confederation of Labor. All members of the French General Confederation of Labor unanimously hope that the foreign ministers' meeting will discuss "the decisive issue of our time - the elimination of German militarism."

Kapov continued: Many letters are sent by students and student groups. Twelve hundred students from the University of Paris demanded that the four powers immediately discuss the issue of stopping the arming of Germany and the issue of universal disarmament.

Kapov pointed out in conclusion: Such letters and telegrams are pouring in from France, West Germany, Britain, Belgium and other countries. These letters and telegrams represent the firm and confident voices of the people of all countries, and in their hearts, an indomitable will is gradually growing - they are determined to safeguard peace, stop the actions of the warmongers, and prevent the reconstruction of a hotbed of war in the heart of Europe by utilizing a revived militaristic West Germany.

　　苏联及时提出禁止重新武装西德问题
    欧洲人民纷函苏联代表团致谢
    并希望四外长助理会议维护和平事业
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报以《人民之声》为题发表卡波夫的巴黎来信。卡波夫指出，全世界亿万人民都以极大的关怀注意着四国外长助理会议进行的情形。各国人民热烈希望阻止另一次流血战争的坚定的声音传到了这里，传到了玫瑰大理石宫的会议厅。每天都有几十封信从各个国家各种不同的团体和普通人民那里寄到玫瑰大理石宫来。虽然这些人有着极不同的政治倾向和政治信仰，可是他们在决心维护和平、制止战争方面却是团结一致的。
    卡波夫说，苏联代表团每天都接到几百封信，任何人读到这些信都不能不为之感动。一切国家的普通人民都认为，苏联代表团是坚强的和平保卫者。他们相信，苏联代表能够尽最大的力量，争取拟订一个能保证外长会议的工作顺利而有助于和平事业的议程。
    卡波夫举出几封信作例子，这些信都对苏联表示深切的感谢，感谢它为把欧洲从法西斯匪帮的桎梏中解放出来所做的一切，感谢它现在又及时地提出禁止德国重新军国主义化的问题。卡波夫特别详细地说到法国总工会写给苏联代表团的一封信。法国总工会全体会员一致希望：外长会议讨论“我们这时代的决定性的问题——肃清德国军国主义的问题”。
    卡波夫继续说：许多信是学生们和学生团体寄来的。一千二百名巴黎大学学生要求四强立即讨论制止武装德国的问题和普遍裁减军备的问题。
    卡波夫在结语中指出：这样的书信和电报正从法国、西德、英国、比利时和其他国家源源寄来。这些书信和电报代表着各国人民坚定的、满怀信心的呼声，在他们的心中，逐渐增长起不屈不挠的意志——他们决心维护和平，制止战争贩子的行动，阻止在欧洲的心脏利用复活了军国主义的西德来重建战争的温床。
