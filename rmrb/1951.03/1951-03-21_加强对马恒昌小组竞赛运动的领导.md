Strengthen Leadership over the Ma Hengchang Group Competition Movement

　　Although the Ma Hengchang Group competition movement has been launched in Beijing, due to the lack of specific leadership from some trade union leaders, the movement is currently in a state of drifting. After the Ma Hengchang Group issued a challenge to workers nationwide, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions responded hastily without careful consideration or thorough discussion and research among cadres. As a result, many trade union cadres, especially grassroots trade union cadres, were unclear about why they should respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group and how to respond. In their practical work, they opposed responding to the challenge with other work of the trade union. They did not understand that carrying out the Ma Hengchang Group competition is a method of improving and adhering to patriotic labor competition, and that this movement can strengthen and consolidate the grassroots organizations of the trade union.

　　At present, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over the movement. Trade union cadres must have a clear ideological understanding that carrying out the Ma Hengchang Group competition is the central task of the trade union's work. The Party, the administration, the trade union, and the broad masses of workers must earnestly study and research the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, strengthen propaganda and mobilization work, and make every worker understand the advantages of the Ma Hengchang Group. Then, focusing on the shortcomings in their work and the problems that urgently need to be solved, they should formulate specific conditions for responding to the challenge. For the groups that have already responded to the challenge, the trade union should provide specific assistance, regularly check whether they have implemented the conditions for responding to the challenge, and what problems and difficulties they have encountered. They should help them solve the problems concretely to ensure the realization of the conditions for responding to the challenge. In the movement, the trade union should regularly help the responding groups summarize their experiences. The groups that have completed the conditions for responding to the challenge should be commended in a timely manner, and the reasons for the groups that have not completed the conditions for responding to the challenge should be found and the direction of future efforts should be pointed out.

　　加强对马恒昌小组竞赛运动的领导
    马恒昌小组竞赛运动虽然已在北京市展开，但由于某些工会的领导干部，对这一运动缺乏具体领导，因而使目前运动仍处于自流状态。马恒昌小组向全国职工提出挑战后，市总工会未经过很好考虑，也没有在干部中很好进行讨论和研究，就仓促应战，因此号召应战后，许多工会干部，尤其是基层工会干部对为什么要向马恒昌小组应战？以及如何应战？思想并不明确，他们在实际工作中把应战和工会的其他工作对立起来。不了解开展马恒昌小组竞赛，是提高与坚持爱国主义劳动竞赛的方法，并通过这一运动可以使工会基层组织健全与巩固起来。
    目前必须加强对运动的领导。工会干部在思想上必须明确认识，开展马恒昌小组竞赛是工会工作的中心任务，党、行政和工会和广大职工必须认真进行马恒昌小组经验的学习与研究，加强宣传鼓动工作，使每个职工都懂得马恒昌小组的优点，然后，针对自己工作中的缺点和工作中迫切需要解决的问题，订出具体应战条件。对已应战的小组，工会应进行具体帮助，经常检查他们是否已实行应战条件？有什么问题和困难？应该帮助他们具体解决，保证应战条件的实现。工会在运动中应经常帮助应战小组总结经验，对完成应战条件的小组，要及时进行表扬，对没有完成应战条件的小组，要找出原因指出今后努力方向。
