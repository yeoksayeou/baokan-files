　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th—Our correspondent reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, resisting the northward advance of the American and other invading forces and the Li Syngman bandit troops on both banks of the Han River, after forty-nine days of fierce fighting, and inflicting heavy blows on the invading army, temporarily withdrew from Seoul on the 14th of this month.

　　The renewed advance of the American and other invading forces and the Li bandit troops on Seoul began on January 25th of this year, using a force of over 230,000 men, equipped with a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks. The American invading forces believed that they could capture Seoul in one fell swoop with their superior killing weapons, and then advance further to occupy the area north of Seoul. However, the heroic and battle-hardened Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers tenaciously resisted the invading army's fierce attacks on both banks of the Han River, making the enemy's progress extremely slow. From Suwon north to Seoul, a mere thirty-odd kilometers, the American invading forces, in this offensive, not only lost time, but also suffered losses of over 30,000 officers and soldiers, and consumed a large amount of weapons, vehicles, and ammunition. Only after the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers voluntarily withdrew from Seoul, were the American invading forces able to reoccupy Seoul.

　　The American invading forces' advance on the Seoul line once again demonstrates that superior military equipment is not the decisive factor in the outcome of a war, but that the morale and combat effectiveness of the people who wield the weapons are often the factors that play a role. In this offensive, the American invading forces dared not take a single step forward without aircraft, tanks, and artillery. American prisoners of war captured in this operation confessed that war-weariness in the U.S. military is growing, and actions such as suicide, self-inflicted wounds, and desertion have occurred. A large number of letters from American soldiers seized by our army on the battlefield vividly reflect the war-weariness of the American soldiers and the rising mood of the people at home demanding peace. This is a new change that has taken place within the invading army in the nearly nine months since the American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea.

　　The American invading forces' blind new offensive has plunged them deeper into an unwinnable quagmire. The resolute, heroic, and resourceful operations of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will continue to annihilate the American invading forces, leading the American invading forces step by step towards their final, inevitable, and complete defeat.

　　【Xinhua News Agency, 16th】The conversation between MacArthur, the supreme commander of the American invading forces in Korea, and Ridgway, the supreme commander in the field, shows that the American invaders harbor deep fears about the future of this reckless counterattack. When MacArthur flew to the Korean front on the 7th, he made a speech. He first expressed "satisfaction" with the indiscriminate firing of his troops, but he immediately warned: "But there should be no illusions in this regard. In such a war of attrition, as our army's front line moves north, the significance of enemy ground forces on the battlefield becomes greater and greater. If our army advances again in the future, then this action will be more militarily advantageous to the enemy than to our army." MacArthur did not dare to say "where exactly the front line will stabilize." The day before MacArthur made his speech, Ridgway also made a speech that was even more clearly losing confidence. He was very distressed by the "deceptive tactics recently used by the Chinese and Korean People's forces." He said: "The Communists still have the strength to launch a major offensive, and they are capable of taking strong preemptive action, if they are willing to do so."

　　抗御敌军四十九日使敌损失三万余人
    中朝人民部队主动撤出汉城
    美军盲目进犯更陷入不能拖出的泥沼
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】本社记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在汉江南北两岸抗御美国等侵略军及李匪军的向北进犯，在历时四十九日，给予进犯军以沉重打击后，于本月十四日暂时撤离汉城。
    美国等侵略军和李匪军此次对汉城的再度进犯，始于本年一月二十五日，使用兵力达二十三万余众，并配以大量飞机、大炮、坦克。美国侵略军自认挟持优势杀人武器，一举即可占领汉城，再攻即可越占汉城以北地区。但是英勇善战的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在汉江两岸顽强抵抗进犯军的猛烈进攻，使敌人的进展极为缓慢。从水原北向汉城仅三十余公里，美国侵略军在这次进攻中，不但丧失了时间，而且损失了三万以上的官兵，消耗了大量武器、车辆和弹药。而在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军从汉城主动撤离后，美国侵略军才得以再占汉城。
    美国侵略军此次向汉城一线的进犯，再次说明优势军事装备不是战争胜负的决定因素，而经常起作用的因素则是掌握武器的人民的士气和战斗力。在此次进犯中，美国侵略军离了飞机、坦克、大炮就不敢前进一步。在这次作战中捉到的美军俘虏供述：美军中的厌战情绪正在增长，并已发生自杀、自伤、逃亡等行动。我军在战场上缴获的美军大批家书中，显著地反映了美军士兵厌战情绪及其国内人民要求和平的情绪的上升。这是美国侵略者发动侵朝战争将近九个月来在侵略军内部所发生的新的变化。
    美国侵略军的盲目的新进攻，使他们更深地陷入不能拖出的泥沼中。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的坚决、英勇和机智的作战，将继续歼灭美国侵略军，使美国侵略军一步步接近于最后的不可避免的彻底失败。
    【新华社十六日讯】侵朝美军的最高司令官麦克阿瑟与战地最高指挥官李奇微的谈话表明，美国侵略者对此次冒险反扑的前途怀着深深的恐惧。麦克阿瑟在七日飞到朝鲜前线时，曾发表一个谈话。他首先对于他的部队盲目发射炮火表示“满意”，但是他随即警告说：“可是不应当在这方面存有幻想。在这样一种引诱战中，随着我军战线的北移，敌军地面部队在战场上的意义越来越大。今后我军如再前进的话，那这种行动在军事上对敌军有利的程度将比对我军为甚。”麦克阿瑟不敢说出“战线究竟将在什么地方稳定下来”。在麦克阿瑟发表谈话的前一天，李奇微也发表了更加明白地丧失信心的谈话。他对于中朝人民部队“最近使用的迷惑对方的战术”，感到十分苦恼。他说：“共军仍然有力量大举进攻，他们能够采取强有力的先发制人的行动，如果他们愿意这样做的话。”
