Learning Comes First
    Lao She

Regarding the question of whether I should adopt other people's opinions at any time when writing the Fang Zhenzhu script, and whether others should provide opinions, I would like to say a few more words here. First, should I adopt other people's opinions at any time:

If I considered myself an old writer, thinking my creative abilities were terrific, I would definitely not accept other people's opinions. However, with over twenty years of writing experience today, I still consider myself a young literary apprentice and like to accept the opinions of my friends. I don't think this attitude is anything to be ashamed of; one learns as long as one lives.

If I weren't writing a play, but a novel or another form of work, perhaps I could carefully consider other people's opinions due to more experience, and accept them critically. But I am writing a play. I am not an expert at writing plays. I am not sure what will definitely have a dramatic effect, or what will not; I don't fully understand stage techniques. Therefore, I am like someone ice skating for the first time; I do whatever others tell me to do.

Also, in the old society, there was no freedom of writing; I had to hide a little bit of thought like a magic trick, to avoid being reported to the authorities and receiving forty lashes. Now, in the new society, I have the freedom to write, and I must produce some thought education to strengthen the influence of literature and art; if I don't do this, I feel a little sorry to society. But, have I sorted out my own thoughts? Hum, dare I shamelessly say, "I have already sorted it out?" This also makes it easier for me to accept other people's opinions, that is, to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas. Sorting out one's own thoughts is not easy; adopting the thoughts provided by others while still closely combining them with artistry is even more difficult. Thus, my humility and the good intentions of my friends do not necessarily lead to the best results. Literary creation is such a difficult thing!

I do not regret my humility, nor do I belittle the good intentions of my friends. The most important thing is to strengthen my ideological learning and writing skills in a timely manner. If someone thinks that I am an old writer who is proficient in all eighteen kinds of martial arts, and does not need to accept other people's opinions, or can critically use the opinions accepted, then it is inevitable that the higher they praise, the harder they will fall.

Now, regarding whether others should provide opinions:

There is nothing wrong with enthusiastically providing opinions to writers. However, with a play, one should wait until the playwright has finished the entire script, preferably during the final rehearsal, before raising opinions, because opinions are empty, and the stage is real; seeing everything on the stage before giving opinions, the speaker will talk about concrete methods based on the gains and losses on the stage, rather than making empty statements. Conversely, when the writer is in the process of creating, raising opinions means that the opinions are easy to raise, but they may not be appropriately aligned with the needs of the stage, inevitably destroying the integrity of the artistic work.

Secondly, do not speak off-topic. An artistic work can only convey a certain point of thought to a limited extent, and arouse a certain emotional response. It is not an all-encompassing encyclopedia, nor can it arouse all emotions—only a madman cries and laughs unpredictably, with erratic emotions. The critic's responsibility is to speak about the thoughts that the artistic work itself wants to convey and the emotions it wants to arouse, to see if its thoughts are correct and whether it has a touching effect, and not to blame the author with off-topic thoughts and effects, saying that the author has not taken care of something or other. That is not addressing the issue itself, but demanding the impossible. If the author's theme is weeping willows, and the critic says that he has not written about yellow croaker, it will definitely not do any good.

In the future, when I write something again, I still welcome my friends to provide opinions, but I hope the opinions are not raised too early, to avoid swaying from east to west because I value the good intentions of my friends. After the first draft of the work is completed, when asking friends to critique it, I hope that friends will speak on the topic, in order to improve the work and not mess it up. As for how I should critically accept opinions, it is still the same sentence: I must first enrich my ideological and technical learning, to avoid swaying from side to side and not being able to hold the helm steady.

　　学习当先
    老舍
    关于在我写方珍珠剧本时，我应否随时采取别人的意见，和别人应否提供意见的问题，我愿在这里再说几句话。先说我应否随时采取别人的意见：
    假若我自居为老写家，以为我的创作本领十分的了不起，我必定不会接受别人的意见。可是，在有了二十几年写作经验的今天，我依然自居为一个年轻的文艺学徒，喜欢接受友人们的意见。我觉得这个态度并未可厚非，活到老学到老啊。
    假若我不是写剧本，而是写小说或别种形式的作品，我也许因经验较多而能够把别人的意见仔细地想过，作有批判的接受。但是，我是在写剧本。对写剧本，我不是内行。怎样就一定有戏剧的效果，或怎样就没有它，我弄不清；我不十分了解舞台技巧。因此，我就像头次去滑冰，别人怎说，我就怎办了。
    还有：在旧社会里，没有写作的自由，我须把一点点思想，像变戏法似的设法隐藏起来，以免被传到有司衙门，挨四十大板。现在，在新社会里，我有了写作的自由，我必须拿出些思想教育，加强文艺的影响；不这样，我就觉得有点对不起社会。可是，我自己的思想搞通了没有呢？哼，我敢大言不惭地说：“已经搞通了”吗？这，也教我容易接受别人的意见，即所谓集思广益啊。搞通了自己的思想，不是容易的事；采取了别人提供的思想，而还要与艺术性紧紧结合起来，就更不容易。于是，我的虚心，友人的善意，并不见得就有最好的结果。文艺创作是多么不容易的事呀！
    我不后悔自己的虚心，也不轻视友人们的善意，最要紧的倒是必须及时加强自己的思想学习，与写作技巧的学习。假若有人以为我是老写家，必定十八般武艺样样精通，不必接受别人的意见，或接受了意见必能批判地运用，那就难免捧得越高，摔得越疼了。
    现在说别人应否提供意见：
    热心地给写家提供意见是没有什么错儿的。不过，以一个剧本来说，应待剧作者把全剧写完之后，顶好是在总排的时候，再把意见提出来，因为意见是空的，舞台是实的；看见了舞台上的一切再提意见，发言者就会就舞台上的得失，说出具体的办法，而不发空言。反之，在写家正在创作的时候，提出意见，则意见好提，而未必妥切地与舞台需要相合，难免破坏了艺术作品的完整。
    其次，不要在题外发言。一个艺术作品只能有限度地传达某一点思想，激起某种情感的反应。它不是一部包罗万象的百科全书，也不能把所有的感情都激动起来——疯子才忽啼忽笑，感情变动莫测呢。批评者的责任是就着艺术作品本身所要传达的思想，所要激动的情感而发言，看它的思想是否正确，与有无感人的效果，而不要用题外的思想与效果来责难作者，说作者还没顾及什么什么呢。那不是就事论事，而是强人所难。作者的主题若是垂柳，而批评者说他没写出来黄花鱼，就一定没有什么好处。
    以后我再写东西，还是欢迎友人们提供意见，但是我希望意见别提的太早，省得因为重视友人的善意而忽东忽西。在作品初稿写成之后，要求友人们批评的时候，我希望友人们对题发言，以期把作品改好，而不改乱了。至于我自己应如何批判地接受意见，还是那句话：我得先充实我的思想与技巧的学习，以免东摇西摆，掌不稳舵。
