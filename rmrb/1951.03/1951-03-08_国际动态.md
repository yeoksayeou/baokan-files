		Indian "Blitz Weekly" Opposes US Rearmament of Japan
	The Indian "Blitz Weekly" published in Bombay, wrote an article opposing the rearmament of Japan by the United States. The article pointed out: India cannot remain silent on this issue. Indian soldiers shed blood to defeat Japanese fascism. The Indian government must clearly declare its opposition to the rearmament of Japan under any pretext.
		Unpopular War of Aggression Against Korea: British Soldiers Tire of War
	The London "Daily Worker" published a letter from a British soldier in Korea. The soldier's name was not published, for understandable reasons. This letter shows that the unjust war against the Korean people is very unpopular in the British army.
	The letter stated: "The general attitude here is that the British have fought enough wars. Our cities were badly damaged in the last war, and we don't need any more wars now."

    孟买出版的印度《闪电周刊》撰文反对美国重新武装日本。文中指出：印度在这个问题上不能保持缄默。印度士兵曾为击败日本法西斯而流过血。印度政府必须明确地宣布；反对以任何借口重新武装日本。
            侵朝战争不得人心英国士兵厌战
    伦敦《工人日报》刊登了一个英国士兵从朝鲜寄来的一封信。这位士兵的名字没有登出来，这种原因是可以理解的。这封信说明对朝鲜人民进行的非正义战争，在英国军队中是非常不得人心的。
    该信称：“这里一般的态度是：英国人打仗已经打够了。我国的城市在上次战争中受到很大的破坏，我们现在再也不需要什么战争了。”
