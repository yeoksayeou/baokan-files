Workers in East China and Chongqing and other places
Celebrate the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations
Determined to step up production to ensure victory in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea

　　Workers in East China enthusiastically support the Labor Insurance Regulations. After the news of the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations spread to various places, workers scrambled to read the newspapers. The news was immediately spread through the loudspeakers and blackboard newspapers of factories in Shanghai. Old workers at the state-owned No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory in the city said happily: "Now that we have the Labor Insurance Regulations as our backing, we are not afraid of anything." Workers in southern Jiangsu also congratulated each other on the promulgation of this regulation. Workers at the private Qingfeng Yarn Factory in Wuxi organized a waist drum team to spread the good news to various workshops. Many workers compared their current lives with the painful lives they led before liberation. Zhao Heshang, a worker at the private Shenxin No. 9 Textile Factory in Shanghai, recalled the "Shen Jiu Massacre" on February 2, 1948, saying: "At that time, our workers not only did not get the rice and coal we demanded from the capitalists, but the reactionaries also used guns and armored vehicles to deal with us, killing many workers. Today, the People's Government not only guarantees our current lives, but also takes care of our old age." Wang Qirong, a worker at the Nanjing Machinery Factory, said: "In the past, who cared about the life or death of us workers! Before liberation, my right eye was burned by molten iron (red iron slurry) while I was working. The boss not only refused to treat me, but also refused to let me rest, so my eye was ruined." Gao Zhaodi, a female worker at the Nanjing Private Xin'an Yarn Factory, sadly told a story after the Labor Insurance Regulations were promulgated. She said that female worker Wei Xiuying was forced by life to continue working in the factory even when she was nine months pregnant, resulting in a difficult birth due to overwork. In order to save the adult's life, she had to painfully crush the child's head and take it out. After reading the Labor Insurance Regulations, the workers of the Nanjing Waterworks immediately recalled the past crimes of the reactionaries who drove old workers out of the factory under the pretext of "old age and weakness, immediate retirement" or "decrepit and incompetent, immediate dismissal," regardless of the workers' life or death, and their anger remained unabated. Shi Chunjiang, an old worker at the Wannan Daily Printing Factory in Wuhu City, told the workers around him when he was printing the Labor Insurance Regulations: "I have been doing this job for forty-five years! Before liberation, I worked at the pseudo-Dajiang Daily for ten whole years, and in the end, they kicked me out of the factory because they thought I was old." He told his fellow workers: Only the Communist Party and the People's Government truly care about the workers and have formulated such regulations.
    The promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations has further increased the workers' enthusiasm for production. Workers in various places have expressed that they will take practical actions to defend and build their motherland and defend this victory that the martyrs have exchanged with their lives. Zhang Dengyu, who has reached the age of retirement at the No. 2 Factory of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, said: "Although I am seventy-four years old, I will step up production to repay Chairman Mao's kindness." Wang Afu, a worker at the No. 2 Factory of Shanghai China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company, has formulated a plan to guarantee 100% implementation of the workshop's agreement.
    Trade unions and relevant departments in various parts of East China are actively carrying out various preparatory work for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations. The Preparatory Committee of the General Trade Union of Southern Jiangsu and the Labor Bureau of Southern Jiangsu held a joint meeting of labor insurance work cadres on January 12 to arrange the preparatory work for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations. The general trade unions of Suzhou and Changzhou have issued statements calling on workers and trade union cadres in the city to earnestly study the Labor Insurance Regulations and related documents, and to do a good job in preparing for labor insurance registration, statistics, and accounting.

    After the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the workers in Chongqing, Luzhou, and other places were all jubilant. Lu Zhihong, an old worker at a steel factory in Chongqing, felt that his old age life was guaranteed and expressed his determination to teach all his skills to everyone and no longer be conservative. At present, workers in various factories in Chongqing are preparing to hold a grand celebration meeting and generally organize discussion meetings and group meetings to conduct in-depth discussions on the regulations. The Preparatory Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has held a training class for labor insurance personnel, drawing about 200 grassroots personnel from trade unions in various factories to participate in the study. After graduation, they will return to their respective factories to vigorously carry out labor insurance work.
    An Bozhou, a worker in Luzhou City, southern Sichuan, said after the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations: "In the past fifty-eight years, under the oppression of the Kuomintang, I was always worried about the life of my family, so how could I have the heart to work? Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I have labor insurance, so I have nothing to worry about; we must wholeheartedly consider how to increase production to ensure the victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea." Capitalists of private factories in the city also expressed their support for the Labor Insurance Regulations, believing that if workers' lives are guaranteed, they will be more active in production, which is also beneficial to them.

　　华东及重庆等地工人
    欢庆公布劳动保险条例
    决心加紧生产保证抗美援朝胜利
    华东各地工人热烈拥护劳动保险条例。劳动保险条例公布的消息传到各地后，工人们互相争阅报纸。上海市各厂的播音机、黑板报都立刻传播这项消息。该市国营第十九棉纺织厂老工人都高兴地说：“现在有了劳动保险条例做靠山，啥也不怕了。”苏南各地工人也为这一条例的颁布而互相恭喜。无锡市私营庆丰纱厂的工人并组织了腰鼓队到各车间报喜。许多工人都把现在的生活和解放前痛苦的生活对比着。上海私营申新第九纺织厂工人赵和尚回忆一九四八年二月二日“申九惨案”时的情形说：“那时我们工友不但没有得到要求资方配给的米、煤，反动派还用枪杆、装甲车来对付我们，打死了好些工友。今天人民政府不但保障了我们现在的生活，还照顾到我们的老年后事。”南京机械厂工人王其荣说：“过去谁来管我们工人死活呀！解放前我的右眼在做工时被化铁水（红铁浆）烫伤，老板不给医治不说，还不准我休养，结果眼睛便坏了。”南京私营新安纱厂女工高招弟在劳动保险条例公布后，痛心地说出了一件往事。她说，女工魏秀英曾因生活所逼，怀孕九个月还上厂生产，结果因劳动过度，小孩难产，为了保全大人的生命，只得忍痛将小孩头弄碎后取出。南京自来水厂的工人读了劳动保险条例后，立刻想起过去反动派以“年老力衰，着即退职”或“老朽无能，着即革职”等为由，不管工人死活把老工人赶出工厂的罪恶行为，余愤不息。芜湖市皖南日报印刷厂老工人施春江在刊载劳动保险条例的报纸打出版样时对周围的工人说：“我干这行四十五年了！解放前在伪大江日报干了整整十个年头，最后他们嫌我年老，把我赶出工厂。”他告诉工友们：只有共产党和人民政府才真正关心工人，才订出这样的条例来。
    劳动保险条例的公布，更提高了工人生产的热情。各地工人们纷纷表示将以实际行动来保卫和建设自己的祖国，保卫这一先烈们用生命换来的胜利果实。上海钢铁公司二厂已到了告老年龄的张登玉说：“我虽已七十四岁，但还要加紧生产，报答毛主席的恩情。”上海中国纺织机器制造公司第二厂工人王阿福，已订出保证百分之百执行车间公约的计划。
    华东各地工会及有关部门，正积极进行实施劳动保险条例的各项准备工作。苏南区总工会筹备委员会及苏南区劳动局已于一月十二日召开劳动保险工作干部联席会议，布置实施劳动保险条例的准备工作。苏州、常州两市的总工会都已发表了声明，号召全市工人和工会干部，认真学习劳动保险条例及有关文件，做好劳动保险的登记、统计及会计等准备工作。（新华社）
    劳动保险条例公布后，重庆、泸州等地工人无不欢欣鼓舞。重庆某钢铁厂老工人陆志泓感到老年生活有了保障，表示决心把技术全部教给大家，不再保守。目前重庆各厂工人正在准备召开盛大的庆祝会，并普遍组织座谈会、小组会，对条例进行深入的讨论。重庆市总工会筹委会已举办了劳动保险人员训练班，抽调各厂工会基层人员约二百人参加学习，毕业后，即回各厂大力开展劳动保险工作。
    川南区泸州市工人安伯騆在劳动保险条例公布后说：“过去五十八年中，我在国民党压榨下，无日不在为一家人的生活担忧，那有心工作？如今在毛主席的领导下有了劳动保险，我什么也不愁了；我们要一心考虑如何增加生产来保证抗美援朝的胜利。”该市私营工厂资方，对劳动保险条例也表示拥护，他们认为工人生活有了保障，就能更积极生产，对他们也是有利的。
