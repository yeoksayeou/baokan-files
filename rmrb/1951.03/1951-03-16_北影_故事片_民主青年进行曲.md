    With the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people suffered unprecedented hardships: the autocratic demon Chiang Kai-shek stretched out his devil claws, tore up the Political Consultative Conference, strangled democracy, colluded with American imperialism to sell out the interests of the motherland, and launched a civil war against the people. The soaring prices chained the people's necks, and the cruel conscription of soldiers and grain drained the people's blood. The Chiang-controlled areas were filled with terror, anger, hunger, and death. In May of 1947, the flames of civil war aroused the broad masses of Chinese youth students, who shouted the call for the anti-Chiang and anti-American movement. Under the strong leadership of the Party, under the slogan of "anti-hunger, anti-civil war," they won over the middle elements, united the majority, and launched a heroic struggle against the reactionaries head-on.
    Fang Zheren is a student in the Faculty of Science at Peking University. He is an upright, enthusiastic, and idealistic young man. He is dissatisfied with reality, but he considers himself superior and unwilling to be involved in the surging democratic wave. Therefore, he can only use the library and the laboratory as his haven. Surrounding Fang Zheren are two sharply contending forces, the progressive and the reactionary. The former includes the Party leaders Da Liu, He Mai, Da Jie, the activists Song Beihua, He Baili, Ma Da, as well as Feng Wenhui and Pan Wenhua, who are too radical in their actions; the latter is the reactionary force led by Chen Xueping, the head of the special agents at Peking University, and a group of sinister and vicious special agent lackeys such as Jiang Zhengqing and Liu Zhen.
    A series of tragic events occurred: Lao Huang, a worker at Peking University, committed suicide due to hunger. Students across the country were severely attacked by hunger, and urgent calls for rescuing the education crisis came from various schools in Beijing and Shanghai. The "Democracy Wall" on the Peking University square was filled with big-character posters reflecting these facts and demanding action. The announcement of the food shortage crisis by the Peking University canteen was an even more direct stimulus. An emergency meeting of the entire school was held that night. The students were mobilized,
    The special agents were also mobilized. On one side was heated discussion, and on the other was shameless sabotage. As a result, the meeting was won due to the leadership of the Party, unifying divergent opinions, determining the direction of action, raising the demand for "anti-hunger" to the understanding of "anti-civil war," and unanimously passing the resolution for a strike and street propaganda on the next day – "May 18th." The students were excited and prepared all night for this work of reaching out to the masses.
    On "May 18th," young students shouted the call of "anti-hunger, anti-civil war" for the broad masses of the people, shaking the sleeping ancient city.
    When Fang Zheren was burying his head in studying in the library, news came that the pseudo-Youth Army had brutally beaten the propaganda team in Xidan. He immediately rushed to the hospital to see his cousin Song Beihua. Thanks to the rescue of the common people, Beihua was not in danger. After he sent Beihua home, they had a conversation, and due to ideological conflicts, Zheren left in anger. Beihua wanted to win over Zheren, but it caused an unpleasant result, and she also felt extremely unhappy.
    That same night, a telegram arrived from home, saying that his father had suffered a stroke and fallen ill due to economic bankruptcy and the takeover of the factory by the Four Banks, and asked him to return to Shanghai quickly.
    Fang Zheren resolutely decided to go south and not return. In order to borrow travel expenses, he went to Tsinghua University to find his old classmate Wang Haisheng, feeling lost. He did not borrow the money, but he saw the transformed Wang Haisheng, which was another stimulus.
    As soon as he returned to Peking University, he received a remittance from home and a letter from his younger brother. The drastic changes at home could not dampen his younger brother's enthusiasm for progress. Instead, he was more determined and actively dedicated himself to the democratic movement. In comparison, Fang Zheren received another most powerful stimulus. While he was struggling to think and unable to resolve his doubts, He Mai, the chairman of the student union, ran to comfort him and helped him understand that the student movement was a part of the revolution. Finally, hope returned to Zheren's eyes.
    Suddenly, reactionary military officers came to the school to arrest He Mai. The students rose up to resist and protect He Mai's safety. The power of the masses moved Fang Zheren, and he resolutely walked out of his haven and bravely joined the ranks of the struggle.
    The climax of the struggle erupted the next day. The great "May 20th" procession combined with the broad masses of the people to form a powerful torrent, rushing straight towards the reactionaries. In this heated struggle, Zheren and Ma Da were arrested by the special agents. In prison, Zheren received the real education of "prison is a university" and strengthened his confidence in the struggle for democracy.
    The "June 1st" "Democratic Square Naming Ceremony" held at Peking University summarized the significance of this movement. The glorious "Democracy" flag fluttered in the clear sky, symbolizing the victory of the revolution. The Chinese youth were more strongly united to strive for democracy. The twelfth film of the new film exhibition month will be released on March 19th.

    民主青年进行曲

    导演——王逸

    随着抗战的胜利，中国人民更遭受到了空前未有的苦难：专制魔王蒋介石伸张魔爪撕毁政协，扼杀民主，勾结美帝国主义出卖祖国的利益，发动违反人民的内战。物价飞涨的铁链锁住了人民的脖子，征兵、征粮的残酷抽干了人民的鲜血。蒋管区各地充满了恐怖、愤怒、饥饿与死亡。就在一九四七年的五月里，内战的炮火激起广大的中国青年学生们，吼出了反蒋反美运动的呼声，通过党的有力领导，在“反饥饿、反内战”的口号下，争取中间分子，团结大多数，正面向反动派展开英勇的斗争。
    方哲仁，是北京大学理学院的学生，他是一个正直、热情而具有理想的青年。他不满现实，然而他自命清高，也不愿置身在澎湃的民主浪潮里，于是他只有把图书馆、实验家作为自己的避风港。围绕在方哲仁左右的，正是进步的与反动的两股尖锐斗争的力量，前者有党的领导者大刘、何迈、大姐，积极分子宋蓓华、贺百里、马达，以及行动过左的冯文辉和潘文华等人；后者是以北大特务头子陈雪屏为首的反动势力，以及江正卿、刘震一批阴险恶毒的特务狗腿子。
    一连串悲惨的事实发生了：北大校工老黄因饥饿而自杀了，全国学生们都受到了饥饿的严重袭击，更由京沪方面传来了各校抢救教育危机的沉痛呼声；北大广场“民主墙”上贴满了反映这些事实，而且要求行动的大字报，北大膳团宣布了停伙危机的消息，更是一个直接的刺激，就在当天晚上召开了全校紧急大会。同学们都动起来了，
    特务们也动起来了，一面是激昂的讨论，一面是无耻的破坏，结果由于党的领导获得了大会的胜利，统一了分歧的意见，确定了行动的方向，将“反饥饿”的要求提高到“反内战”的认识，并一致通过第二天——“五一八”罢课、上街宣传的决议。同学们兴奋的通宵筹备这件走向人民大众的工作。
    “五一八”青年学生们为广大人民喊出了“反饥饿、反内战”的呼声，震动了酣睡的古城。
    方哲仁正在图书馆中埋头念书的时候，传来了伪青年军在西单毒打宣传队的消息，他立刻奔到医院去看他表妹宋蓓华。蓓华由于老百姓的救护，并没有受到危险。他送蓓华回家以后，他们俩人在谈话中，因为思想上冲突的，哲仁生气走了；蓓华为了争取哲仁，反而造成不愉快的结果，也感到极度的不快。
    就在当天晚上，家里的电报来了，父亲因经济破产，工厂遭四行接管，而中风病倒，叫他赶快回上海。
  方哲仁毅然决定南下，不再回来了。为了借路费，他怅然的跑到清华大学去找老同学王海生，钱没有借到，可是他却见到了转变后的王海生，结果又是一个刺激。
  他刚回到北大，就接到了家里寄来的汇票，和他弟弟写来的信。家里的剧变打击不了热情前进的弟弟，他反而更坚定，更积极的献身于民主运动，相比之下，方哲仁又接受了一个最有力的刺激。他正在苦于思索而不能自解的时候，学生会主席何迈跑来安慰他，帮助他了解到学生运动是革命的一部分。最后，哲仁的眼中重新有了希望。
  突然有反动军官来校逮捕何迈，同学们群起一致反抗，保护了何迈的安全，群众的力量感动了方哲仁，他毅然走出了避风港，勇敢的加入了斗争的队伍。
  斗争的高潮在第二天爆发了，伟大的“五二○”行列与广大人民结合成一股有力的洪流，向反动派直冲过去。在这热烈的斗争中，哲仁与马达被特务们捕走了，在监狱中，哲仁接受了“监狱即是大学”的真实教育，坚定了为民主斗争的信心。
  “六一”在北大举行的“民主广场命名典礼”，总结了这次运动的意义，辉煌的“民主”旗在晴空中飘扬，象征着革命的胜利，中国的青年们为争取民主更坚强的团结起来。新片展览月第十二部三月十九日上映
