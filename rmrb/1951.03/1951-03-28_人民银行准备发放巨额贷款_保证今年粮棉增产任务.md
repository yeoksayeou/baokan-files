　　People's Bank of China Prepares to Issue Huge Loans
    Guarantee Increased Grain and Cotton Production Targets This Year
    The Head Office of the People's Bank of China will issue huge loans this year to support various production endeavors, including agriculture, water conservancy, fisheries, and logging. With the spring plowing season already underway, more than half of the loans have been allocated to various regions and branches before the 10th of this month to ensure farmers can plant in a timely manner.
    The People's Bank of China has decided to issue agricultural (including water conservancy, fisheries, and logging) loans this year, with preliminary planned figures showing an increase of 193.85% compared to last year. From a regional perspective, East China will see an increase of 308.44%, North China an increase of 88.65%, Northwest China an increase of 55.88%, and Central South China an increase of 31.58%. In addition, within the maximum loan balance stipulated by the Head Office for each region, local branches can continue to lend out old agricultural loans that have been recovered based on local needs. Therefore, the actual disbursement figures will exceed the planned targets.
    This year's agricultural loans from the People's Bank of China are primarily issued in coordination with the grain and cotton production increase targets. The loans are intended for various purposes, including farmland water conservancy, pest and disease control, animal husbandry, seeds, farm tools, cotton, tobacco, silkworms, and specialty products. Among these, farmland water conservancy is the focus. Loans for irrigation and water conservancy projects are mostly used for constructing large-scale irrigation canals. Fisheries loans are mainly used to support fishermen and state-owned enterprises in East China, Central South China, and Hebei Province in repairing boats and nets, and to meet their needs in transportation, sales, procurement, and aquaculture. Logging loans are allocated to the Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions, as well as Shanxi Province, to cover expenses for logging, purchasing tools, paying wages, and transportation.
    To ensure that loans are promptly delivered to farmers and fishermen, the People's Bank of China began preparations for this year's loans earlier than in previous years. Most of the funds have been allocated to various regions successively since the beginning of spring, and some regions, such as East China and Central South China, have already begun disbursement. The disbursement of various loans is jointly arranged with relevant leading agencies, which ensures that the pace of loan disbursement and utilization is consistent. Due to the long-term stability of prices, loans are calculated in currency, which will greatly expand the market for RMB in rural areas.

　　人民银行准备发放巨额贷款
    保证今年粮棉增产任务
    中国人民银行总行今年将以巨额贷款扶助农业、水利、渔业、伐木等各种生产事业。现在春耕季节已经到来，为使农民能够及时播种，一半以上的贷款在本月十日前已下拨各区、分行。
    人民银行今年决定发放的农业（包括水利、渔业、伐木）贷款，其初步计划数字较去年增加百分之一百九十三点八五。从地区来看，华东区增加百分之三百零八点四四，华北区增加百分之八十八点六五，西北区增加百分之五十五点八八，中南区增加百分之三十一点五八。此外，在总行规定各地区最高放款余额的范围内，各地分行所收回的旧农贷，仍可根据各地需要继续贷放。所以实际发放数字将超过预定计划。
    人民银行今年的农业贷款主要是配合粮、棉增产任务来发放的。贷款的用途有农田水利、防治病虫、畜牧、种籽、农具、棉花、烟草、蚕丝、特产等项目。其中以农田水利为重点。灌溉水利工程方面的贷款，多半用于修建大型灌溉渠道。渔业贷款主要用于扶助华东、中南、河北三个地区的渔民和公营企业修船补网，并满足他们在运销、采购及养殖等方面的需要。伐木贷款分配给中南、西南、西北各区及山西省，作采伐木材、购置工具、发放工资以及运输等的费用。
    为了使贷款及时发放到农民和渔民手里，人民银行今年的贷款准备工作比往年做得早。大部款项已在开春时就陆续拨到各地，部分地区如华东和中南，目前已在开始发放。各种贷款的发放工作都是和有关的领导机关联合布置的，这样就使贷款的发放和使用的步调趋于一致。由于物价的长期稳定，贷款都以货币计算，这将大为扩大人民币在农村的市场。
