Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th. Our front-line reporter's account of the orderly and voluntary temporary evacuation of Seoul by the Korean people: On the eve of the retreat, in the golden glow of the setting sun, soldiers of the Korean People's Army slowly lowered the magnificent flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fluttering on the top of the building. At this moment, the citizens bowed to the national flag and said, "Dear one, we will return with you."

Before this, heroic Seoul remained calm as usual. Although the artillery fire of the American invading army was bombarding the city across the river, and swarms of enemy planes were diving and strafing the streets, the people of Seoul were still going about their business. Young people were transporting the last batch of ammunition for the warriors at the front. Cars were still going back and forth on the roads. There were still many people trading in Dongdaemun Square.

When the order for the temporary evacuation of Seoul was issued, the people of Seoul were not caught by surprise. They pushed the carts they had prepared long ago, and many people carried their babies on their backs, walking out of various alleys in an orderly manner towards the areas designated by the People's Government in advance. The artillery of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers bombarded the American invading army huddled on the south bank of the Han River, covering the retreating people. By midnight, the people of Seoul who were unwilling to bow their heads to the enemy had all left.

Among the people of Seoul who temporarily retreated, more than 58,000 have responded to the government's call to participate in supporting the front-line work. They want to assist their army in annihilating the invading army in Korea.

　　英雄的朝鲜人民
    撤离汉城时秩序井然
    五万余人已参加支援前线工作
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】本社前线记者报道朝鲜人民秩序井然地主动暂时撤离汉城的情形说：撤退前夕，在夕阳的金辉里，朝鲜人民军的战士将飘扬在大厦顶上的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的壮丽的国旗，徐徐降落。这时候，市民们都向国旗鞠躬，并且说：“亲爱的，我们就会同你一起回来的。”
    在这之前，英雄的汉城还是镇静如常。虽然美国侵略军的炮火在隔江向城内轰击，成群的敌机在向街道上俯冲扫射，可是汉城人民仍然各安其业。青年们在为前线的勇士们运送最后的一批弹药。汽车依旧在马路上来来去去。东大门广场上仍然有很多人在做买卖。
    当暂时撤离汉城的命令下达的时候，汉城的人民并没有感到突然。他们推起早已备好的车子，有许多人背上自己的婴儿，从各个巷口里走出来，向着人民政府事先指定的地区秩序井然地走去。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的大炮，向着蜷缩在汉江南岸的美国侵略军轰击，掩护着撤退的人民。到半夜时，不愿向敌人低头的汉城人民已经走完了。
    在暂时撤退的汉城人民中，已有五万八千多人响应政府的号召，去参加支援前线的工作。他们要协助自己的军队，把侵略军消灭在朝鲜。
