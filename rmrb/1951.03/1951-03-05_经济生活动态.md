	Hebei Utilizes Agricultural Product Exhibitions to Promote Agricultural Technology
	Holding agricultural product exhibitions to conduct technical education for the broad masses of farmers is one of the effective methods for Hebei Province to promote agricultural technology. Last year, various localities in the province held a total of more than 280 agricultural product exhibitions in various forms, with over 4 million visitors, enabling the technical improvement movement to be more widely promoted. Most of the local agricultural product exhibitions were hosted by farms and held according to the production season and farmers' needs. Agricultural product exhibitions mostly took place in places where farmers gathered for market fairs and temple fairs, and the exhibition methods were lively and diverse. Some even invited local labor models to personally introduce their products and technical experience. These gave the farmers a very deep impression. Some agricultural product exhibitions also printed brief explanatory brochures to provide farmers with a basis for emulation. Some agricultural product exhibitions also conducted on-the-spot experiments on new agricultural tools and drug preparation, so that agricultural product exhibitions fully played the role of disseminating science and technology.

	Shanghai Native Produce Merchants' Business Volume Reached 900 Billion Yuan Last Year
	Shanghai's private native produce merchants, facing the countryside and engaging in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, had an annual business volume of over 920 billion yuan. With the development of business, the feudal nature of the business has also been gradually reformed. For example, the medicinal materials, north-south goods, fruits, and local goods industries uniformly adopted the city scale for transactions from May of last year; the native produce industry's brokers also directly sold goods to retailers or vendors, breaking the old rule that had existed for decades that all goods must be sold to wholesalers and were not allowed to be directly wholesaled to retailers and vendors. However, the feudal nature of the native produce merchants' business has not been completely reformed, and it is necessary to make persistent efforts to eliminate it in this year's expansion of material exchange between urban and rural areas.

	Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative Organizes Exchange of Local and Special Products Within the Province
	In order to vigorously organize the purchase and sale of local and special products, the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a provincial meeting of supply and marketing cooperatives at the city, county, and banner levels in December of last year. After discussion and research at the meeting, three fixed purchase contracts were signed. These three contracts include 32 exchange relationships among 18 city, county, and banner cooperatives, totaling 360 million yuan in Renminbi, with the purchase and sale of local and special products including mountain goods from Longsheng, Wudong, and Helin counties, cowhide tendons from Baotou City, and pottery from Qingshui County. Among them, for example, Qingshui County's pottery had a disconnection phenomenon in the past where it could not be sold out while other places needed it very much. This provincial fixed purchase contract solved this problem.

	Beijing Post Office Launches Intra-City "Express Mail" Service
	In order to facilitate the delivery of urgent letters or items by various agencies and citizens in the capital, the Beijing Postal Administration began to handle "express mail" and "express small packages" within the city walls of Beijing from February 26th. In addition to the normal postage, these two express items will be charged an additional express fee of 4,000 yuan per item. After receiving the express mail, the post office guarantees delivery to the recipient within two hours. However, the weight of each express mail item is limited to 2 kilograms.

	In addition, in order to facilitate the public's remittance and cashing of funds, the bureau has extended the time for handling remittances and exchanges. The office hours from Monday to Saturday are from 8:30 am to 7:30 pm, with no break at noon, and on Sundays and holidays, the office is open for half a day from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm.

    河北利用农产品展览会推广农业技术
    举行农产品展览会，向广大农民进行技术教育，是河北省推广农业技术的有效方法之一。去年该省各地共举办各种形式的农产品展览会二百八十余次，参观人数达四百余万，使技术改良运动得到更普遍的推广。各地农产品展览会多由农场主持，根据生产季节与农民需要举办。农产品展览会多利用集市庙会农民聚集的场所举行，展览方法活泼多样。有的并聘请当地劳动模范亲自介绍他的产品和技术经验。这些都给农民以极深的印象。有些农产品展览会上还印制了简要的说明书，给农民以仿效的依据。有些农产品展览会还当场实验新式农具、药剂配制等，使农产品展览会充分发挥了传播科学技术的作用。
            上海土产商去年经营额达九千亿元
    上海市私营土产商面向农村，经营城乡物资交流，全年经营额达九千二百余亿元。随着营业的发展，业务上的封建性也已逐步改革。如药材、南北货、水果、地货等业于去年五月份起一律改用了市秤交易；一般土产业的牙行也直接售货给零售商或摊贩，打破了几十年来必须全部售与批发商而不许直接批发给零售商及摊贩的陋规。但土产商业务上的封建性还没有全部改革掉，还需要在今年扩大城乡物资交流中再接再励地加以革除。
