　　Beijing Democratic Women's Federation Hosts Catholic Figures
　　Beijing Women to Hold Garden Party on March 8th
　　The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation hosted Catholic nuns and church members on March 2nd; those attending included Sister Wang Chunjing of the Joseph Convent and Sister He Dexin, who is over sixty years old, totaling more than fifty people. Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, said in her speech: "Although our beliefs are different, we all have a patriotic heart; today's meeting symbolizes that we have further united. Now American imperialism is using the cutting off of economic resources to threaten our country's Catholic friends, but we must be self-reliant and resolutely break away from the shackles of imperialism so that religion can become our own." Finally, she represented the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation in welcoming church members to maintain regular contact with the Women's Federation in the future and to unite more closely under the banner of patriotism. Finally, Sister Wang Chunjing said: "In the movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, we have already begun to eliminate pro-American and worshipful-of-America thoughts, and established thoughts of hatred and contempt for American imperialism. In the future, we will strengthen our studies in our own positions and do a good job in work and production. If everyone does a good job in production, it will promote the reform movement of Catholicism. We must also teach students and children to recognize friends and enemies in the reform movement, and follow the bright road under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government."
　　Also: The Preparatory Committee of all circles in Beijing commemorating "March 8" International Working Women's Day has decided to hold a women's garden party in the Labor People's Cultural Palace on March 8. The garden party will be held from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the 8th; all women are free to enter the park.

　　京民主妇联招待天主教人士
    三月八日京妇女将举行游园大会
    北京市民主妇女联合会于三月二日招待天主教修女和教友；到会有若瑟修女会修女王纯净、六十多岁的修女贺德馨等五十余人。北京市民主妇女联合会副主席刘清扬在致词中说：“我们的信仰虽然不同，但都有一颗爱国的心；今天的会议象征着我们已进一步团结起来。现在美帝国主义利用断绝经济来源来威胁我国天主教友，但我们要自力更生，坚决脱离帝国主义的羁绊，使宗教成为我们自己的。”最后她代表北京市民主妇女联合会欢迎教友们以后经常与妇联取得联系，在爱国主义的旗帜下，更紧密地团结起来。最后修女王纯净说：“我们在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中已开始肃清了亲美、崇美思想，树立了仇视、鄙视美帝国主义的思想，今后将在自己的岗位上加强学习，搞好工作和生产；每人都搞好了生产，就能促进天主教的革新运动。我们并要在革新运动中教导学生、子女认清敌友，在毛主席、人民政府的领导下走上光明大道。”
    又：北京市各界纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节筹备委员会决定于三月八日在劳动人民文化宫举行妇女游园大会。游园会自八日上午十时起至下午五时止；凡属女性均可自由入园。
