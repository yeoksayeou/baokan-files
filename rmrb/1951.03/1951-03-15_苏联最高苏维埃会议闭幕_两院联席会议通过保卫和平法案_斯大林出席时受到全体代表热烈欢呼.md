    Soviet Supreme Soviet Session Concludes
    Joint Session of the Two Chambers Passes Law on the Protection of Peace
    Stalin Receives Enthusiastic Applause from All Delegates Upon Attending
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities held a joint session on the 12th. When Stalin and other government leaders appeared on the government platform, all delegates and guests greeted them with prolonged and enthusiastic applause. Among the guests attending the meeting were members of various foreign diplomatic missions, members of the Soviet Peace Committee, and representatives of the working people of the capital. Tikhonov, Supreme Soviet Deputy and Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, delivered a report at the meeting on enacting a law to prohibit war propaganda and protect peace.
    [Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, March 14th] TASS, Moscow: The joint session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of Nationalities and Council of the Union on the 12th, after hearing and discussing Tikhonov's report on prohibiting war propaganda and enacting a law to protect peace, unanimously passed the Law on the Protection of Peace. The Supreme Soviet session was then declared closed.
    During the discussion, Madulis, President of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, stated: The decision of the Soviet Supreme Soviet to pass the Law on the Protection of Peace will be unanimously supported by all the working people of our country, because there are not and cannot be any people in our country who support aggression or advocate a third world war.
    The writer Simonov stated: The Law on the Protection of Peace is as clear as crystal. Anyone who, in any place and in any way, promotes the outbreak of a new war, only prison awaits him. Simonov said that he would represent his constituents as well as Soviet writers and journalists in unconditionally voting in favor of the bill proposed by Tikhonov.
    Kuznetsov, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, stated: It is most fair to condemn war propaganda as a great crime against humanity. The Soviet trade unions, which unite more than 30 million workers and staff, will, together with other people's organizations, always support the Soviet government's peace policy.
    Stakhanovite worker Bykov pointed out: The Soviet Supreme Soviet's passage of the Law on the Protection of Peace will show that the Soviet Union is always ready to defend peace by all means and prevent the imperialists from launching another world war.
    Also speaking at the meeting were: Ukrainian Academy of Sciences President Baratyn, Belarusian People's Representative and famous Soviet singer Alexandrovskaya. They all unanimously expressed their support for the Law on the Protection of Peace.
    The meeting then unanimously passed the Law on the Protection of Peace with high enthusiasm. The full text of this law is as follows:
    "The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, guided by the lofty principles of the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy, in order to consolidate peace and friendly relations between countries, believes that the conscience and sense of justice of the people of the world, who have suffered the devastation of two world wars in thirty years, cannot tolerate the unbridled war propaganda of the aggressive groups in certain countries, and supports the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress, because this declaration expresses the desire of all progressive humanity to prohibit and condemn the criminal war propaganda.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics hereby orders: (1) Any form of war propaganda shall be regarded as an act that undermines the cause of peace, creates the threat of a new war, and is therefore the most serious crime endangering humanity. (2) Anyone who commits the crime of war propaganda shall be handed over to the court for trial as a heinous criminal."

　　苏联最高苏维埃会议闭幕
    两院联席会议通过保卫和平法案
    斯大林出席时受到全体代表热烈欢呼
    【本报讯】据新华社十四日讯：塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院与民族院于十二日举行联席会议。当斯大林和政府的其他领袖们出现在政府席上时，全体代表及来宾热烈欢呼历久不息。参加会议的来宾，有各国外交使团人员、苏联拥护和平委员会委员和首都劳动人民的代表。最高苏维埃代表、苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫在会上作了关于制止战争宣传与颁布保卫和平法案的报告。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃民族院和联盟院十二日的联席会议，在听取并讨论了吉洪诺夫所作关于禁止战争宣传及颁布保卫和平法案的报告后，已一致通过了保卫和平法。最高苏维埃会议至此宣告闭幕。
    在讨论中，立陶宛科学院院长马杜力斯发言称：苏联最高苏维埃会议通过保卫和平法案的决定，将得到我国全体劳动人民的一致拥护，因为我国没有而且也不能有拥护侵略或主张第三次世界大战的人。
    作家西蒙诺夫称：保卫和平法案像水晶一样地明白。凡是在任何地方用任何方式力促新战争爆发的人，只有监狱在等待着他。西蒙诺夫表示将代表他的选民以及苏联作家和新闻记者，无条件投票赞成吉洪诺夫所提出的法案。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记库兹涅佐夫称：斥责战争宣传为违反人道的极大罪行是最公平的。团结了三千万以上职工的苏联工会，将和其他的人民团体一道，永远支持苏联政府的和平政策。
    斯塔哈诺夫工作者比科夫指出：苏联最高苏维埃通过保卫和平法案，将表明苏联随时都准备用一切办法来保卫和平并使帝国主义者不能发动另一次世界大战。
    在会上发言的尚有：乌克兰科学院院长巴拉丁，白俄罗斯人民代表、苏联名歌唱家亚历山德罗夫斯卡娅。他们都一致表示支持保卫和平法案。
    会议继以高涨的热情，一致通过保卫和平法案。这一法案的全文如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃在苏联的爱好和平政策的崇高原则指导下，为巩固和平与各国的友好关系，认为在三十年间身受两次世界大战的浩劫的全世界人民的良知与正义感，不能容忍某些国家的侵略集团肆无忌惮地进行战争宣传，并且拥护第二届世界和平大会的宣言，因为这个宣言表示了全体进步人类要求禁止和谴责罪恶的战争宣传的愿望。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃兹命令：（一）不论是任何形式的战争宣传，都应视为破坏和平事业、制造新战争威胁，因而是危害人类的最严重的罪行。（二）凡犯宣传战争罪行者应交付法庭，作为罪大恶极的罪犯加以审讯。”
