The Shanghai Women's Federation Organizes Work Teams to Go Deep into Neighborhoods
Trials of Establishing a Representative Conference of Housewives Gain Experience
    Since the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's Third Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting passed the "Organizational Regulations for Women's Representative Conferences" last year, the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation, in order to thoroughly transform the organizational form of women's groups in Shanghai, organized a 46-person work team with the Shanghai Housewives' Federation last December. It selected the jurisdiction of the First Police Station of Jiangning District as the focus to establish a representative conference of housewives in order to create experience and prepare for the comprehensive expansion of this work.
    Before the work team went into the neighborhoods, they first understood and studied the situation in Jiangning District; all team members also studied the "Organizational Regulations for Women's Representative Conferences" and set out a work plan. On January 12th of this year, the work team was divided into eight groups and went down to the neighborhoods. First, they discovered activists through police stations, schools, housewives' associations, teachers, lane watchers, water groups, and winter defense service teams. Then, they held meetings of activists to educate them on issues such as resisting America and aiding Korea, winter defense, opposing spies, why women should organize, and how to organize. Then, they discussed and studied with them how to mobilize women to attend meetings, how to generate women representatives, and determine meeting dates.
    Through the mobilization of these activists, women's mass meetings and forums were held in various neighborhoods. Many women representatives were elected at the meetings; in areas where shantytowns were concentrated, because it was not easy to find house numbers, representatives were selected based on residents' water groups; in individual neighborhoods that were not easy to mobilize, invitations were used; women representatives who originally attended the district people's congress served as ex officio representatives. In order to facilitate contact between the police station's women's representative committee and the representatives, several general representatives were elected from among the representatives.
    After the representatives and general representatives were generated, a representatives' forum was held for education. The main content of the education was to clarify the rights and obligations of representatives, clarify the content of the representatives' covenant, and ensure the success of the representatives' meeting. In order to help the representatives overcome difficulties, it was decided that representatives with children should try to arrange for their children themselves, or a temporary nursery would be set up by the conference to take care of them during the meeting. In the process of educating the representatives, opinions and demands of the masses were also collected from the representatives.
    The women's representative conference was held on January 26th. The main agenda of the conference was to convey the resolutions of the Jiangning District People's Congress, call on housewives to actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, assist the government in winter defense and registration of reactionary party, league, and special agent elements, and comfort revolutionary military families. At the women's representative conference, a representative conference committee was established as the leading body to implement resolutions and preside over daily work after the meeting.
    Through this conference, 281 representatives were generated, 68 forums were held, 26 mass meetings were held, women in various neighborhoods were widely contacted, and nearly 300 activists were discovered and cultivated. It has played a significant role in implementing the government's calls: for example, in order to respond to the district government's call, the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation launched a movement to publicize the opposition to special agents. Among the 130 women who signed up to participate, women in the jurisdiction of the First Police Station of Jiangning District accounted for 80 to 90 people. Many women, after attending the representative conference, participated in the night patrol work of the winter defense service team and were very active in performing winter defense tasks. Many representatives became activists in supporting revolutionary soldiers and giving preferential treatment to revolutionary military families. At the same time, the women's own demands, such as running literacy classes, nurseries, improving neighborhood cleanliness, and mediating family disputes, were quickly reflected.
    This women's representative conference has gained the following preliminary experiences:
    1. Winning the cooperation and assistance of all parties is one of the important conditions for carrying out work. This time, the work team took the initiative to seek help and cooperation from the district government, police station, schools, and other parties, and the results were very good. At the same time, the work team seized every opportunity to promote the women's representative conference, which aroused everyone's attention.
    2. Working methods should be flexible. The generation of representatives this time was based on the circumstances and conditions of the local masses at the time, using a variety of methods to generate representatives (such as through mass meetings, forums, elections based on the original water groups, and appointments). The generation of general representatives was also controlled by each group according to the specific situation and conditions. In order to facilitate work contact, general representatives were mainly selected based on the different classes of representatives, with about ten representatives generating one general representative, and four or five representatives generating one general representative.
    3. This representative conference has proved that whether in areas with or without a work foundation, holding a women's representative conference is the best way to boldly and extensively mobilize women to contact women. Through this representative conference, many new activists were discovered, almost more than ten times the original number. At the same time, the method of the representative conference committee contacting the general representatives and representatives, and the representatives contacting the masses is very flexible. The general reaction of women in the district is: they want to organize, but they are afraid of meetings. Hearing that the representative conference only meets when there is something to do, and does not meet when there is nothing to do, they are very happy to participate, especially the women in the shantytowns, who volunteer to be representatives.
    4. Educating representatives and gathering representatives separately for learning is an important link in improving the understanding of representatives; it is also an important preparation work before the representative conference is held.
    There are still many shortcomings in this work, such as the lack of in-depth publicity and education. But generally speaking, this work is relatively successful.

　　上海妇联组织工作队深入里弄
    试建家庭妇女代表会议获得经验
    自去年全国民主妇女联合会第三次执行委员扩大会议通过了妇女代表会议组织通则后，上海市民主妇女联合会为了彻底转变上海市妇女群众的组织形式，在去年十二月，和上海市家庭妇女联合会组织了一个四十六人的工作队，选择江宁区第一派出所辖区为重点，建立了家庭妇女代表会议，以求创造经验，作全面展开这一工作的准备。
    工作队下里弄之前，先进行了解和研究江宁区的情况；全体队员又学习了妇女代表会议组织通则，定出工作计划。今年一月十二日，工作队分成八组，下到里弄中去。首先是通过派出所、学校、家庭妇女联谊会、教员、看弄堂的、自来水小组和冬防服务队等发现积极分子。接着召开积极分子会议，向她们进行抗美援朝、冬防、反对特务、妇女为什么要组织起来、用什么办法组织起来等问题的教育。再和她们讨论研究如何动员妇女群众来开会，如何产生妇女代表及确定开会日期等。
    通过对这些积极分子的发动，各里弄召开了妇女群众大会和座谈会。许多妇女代表就在会上被选举出来；棚户集中的地区，因为不容易找到门牌，便根据居民自来水小组推选代表；个别不易发动的里弄，便用邀请的办法；原来出席区人民代表会议的妇女代表作为当然代表。为了便于派出所妇女代表委员会和代表们的联系，又在代表中推选出若干总代表。
    代表和总代表都产生后，便召开代表座谈会，进行教育。教育的主要内容是弄清代表的权利义务，弄清代表公约内容和保证开好代表会。为了帮助代表们克服困难，决定有孩子拖累的代表尽可能自行把孩子安插好，或者在开会时，由大会设临时托儿站收托。在教育代表的过程中，同时也向代表们搜集了群众的意见和要求。
    妇女代表会议在一月二十六日举行。会议主要议程是传达江宁区各界人民代表会议的决议，号召家庭妇女积极参加抗美援朝运动，协助政府做好冬防和登记反动党团特务分子，以及慰劳革命军人家属等工作。在妇女代表会议上产生了代表会议委员会，作为会后执行决议和主持日常工作的领导机构。
    通过这次会议，产生了二百八十一名代表，召开座谈会六十八次，群众大会二十六次，普遍联系了各里弄的妇女群众，发现和培养了积极分子近三百人。在贯彻政府的号召上发生了显著的作用：如上海民主妇女联合会为了响应区政府的号召，发动了反对特务宣传的运动，在报名参加的一百三十位妇女中，江宁区第一派出所辖区的妇女占了八、九十人。不少妇女在开过代表会议后，参加了冬防服务队的夜巡工作，在执行冬防任务上表现得很积极，很多代表更成了拥护革命军人、优待革命军人家属工作中的积极分子。同时，妇女群众的切身要求，如举办识字班、托儿所、搞好里弄清洁和调解家庭纠纷等，也很快反映了上来。
    这次妇女代表会议，已取得如下几点初步经验：
    一、争取各方面力量的配合与协助，是展开工作的重要条件之一。这次工作队主动争取了区政府、派出所、学校等各方面的帮助与配合，结果收效很大。同时工作队也随时随地抓住机会进行妇女代表会议的宣传工作，引起了大家的重视。
    二、工作方法要灵活。这次代表的产生是根据当时当地群众的情况与条件，运用了多种多样产生代表的办法（如通过群众大会、座谈会选举，根据原有自来水小组选举及聘请等办法）。总代表的产生也是根据具体情况与条件，各组自行掌握。为了工作上的联系方便，总代表主要是根据代表的不同阶层来选出，有十个左右代表产生一个总代表的，也有四五个代表产生一个总代表的。
    三、这次代表会议证明了不论在有无工作基础的地区，召开妇女代表会议是一个大胆放手广泛发动妇女联系妇女的最好办法。经过这次代表会议发现了许多新的积极分子，几乎超过原有的十多倍。同时代表会议委员会联系总代表和代表，代表联系群众的办法都是很机动灵活的。该区妇女的一般反应是：要求组织起来，但又怕开会。听说代表会议有事就开会，无事不开会，就很高兴参加，尤其是棚户区的妇女，有自告奋勇愿当代表的。
    四、教育代表，分别集合代表进行学习，是提高代表认识的重要环节；同时也是召开代表会以前的重要准备工作。
    这次工作中还存在着不少缺点，如宣传教育工作的不够深入等。但总的说起来，这次工作是比较成功的。
