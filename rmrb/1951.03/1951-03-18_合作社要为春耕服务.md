　　Cooperatives Must Serve Spring Plowing
    It is entirely correct that cooperatives in Hebei Province are actively planning seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and livestock to support spring plowing and production for their members. Rural cooperatives across the country should focus their work on preparing for spring plowing.
    The most important task at present is to formulate plans based on the actual needs of the members and help them with production. Pest-affected areas should be well prepared with pesticides; disaster areas should vigorously promote the sale of agricultural and sideline products of the members to exchange for food and seeds for the masses. Cotton-producing areas should prepare a large amount of high-quality cotton seeds. In a word, cooperatives must have plans, have priorities, and truly strive to do good things for their members. It should be noted that: first, supply and sales should be balanced to adjust the needs of all parties. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative transported the homespun cloth produced by its members to other provinces to exchange for livestock, and then sold it to the members at low prices, which is a very good example. Second, it is necessary to grasp the seasonality and ensure timely supply, such as before spring plowing, farmers need seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, etc., and delays will affect production. Third, the supply prices should be reasonable and not disadvantage the members, and the quantity and specifications should meet the needs and habits of the masses.
    Before spring plowing, all localities should earnestly strengthen the work of cooperatives and check the situation of cooperatives serving spring plowing and production. Where cooperatives have not been established, they should be established now, and strive to ensure that cooperatives can serve spring plowing and production well, and that the business and organization of cooperatives will develop accordingly.

### 合作社要为春耕服务

　　合作社要为春耕服务
    河北省合作社积极筹划种籽、肥料、农具、牲口，支持社员春耕生产，这是完全正确的。全国各地农村合作社均应以准备春耕为中心来展开工作。
    目前最重要的工作是根据社员实际需要来制订计划，帮助社员生产。虫害地区应很好的准备农药；灾区应当大力推销社员农、副业产品，为群众换回口粮和种籽。产棉区应大量准备优良棉种。一句话合作社必须有计划，有重点，真正努力为社员办好事情，这里要提起注意的是：第一要做到有供有销，调剂各方需要，河北省省社将社员生产的土布运往外省换回牲口，然后低价卖给社员，便是一个很好的例子。第二要掌握季节性，作到供应及时，如春耕前农民需要种籽、肥料、农具等，误了就要影响生产。第三，供应的价格要合理、不使社员吃亏，数量、规格都要合乎群众需要和习惯。
    春耕前，各地都应认真加强合作社工作，检查合作社为春耕生产服务的情形。没有建立合作社的地方，现在应当抓紧建立，争取合作社能够很好地为春耕生产服务，并使合作社的业务和组织随之获得发展。
