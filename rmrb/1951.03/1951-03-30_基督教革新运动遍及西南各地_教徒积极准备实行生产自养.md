Xinhua News Agency: The Christian reform movement has spread throughout the Southwest region, and several churches that have severed economic ties with imperialism are actively preparing to implement self-reliance. Christian believers in seventy-six cities and counties including Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Ya'an, Nanchong, Yuechi, Guangyuan, Jiangjin, Chongning, Zhaotong, and Kangding in the Southwest region, have successively held various symposiums, reform movement conferences, current affairs study sessions, and anti-American patriotic accusation meetings during the reform movement. After these meetings, believers gradually recognized the crimes of imperialism in using the church to invade our country, and their political consciousness has gradually increased. Currently, Christian believers in various places are preparing or have already participated in labor production in order to achieve self-reliance. Christian churches in Yuechi, Yingshan in the North Sichuan region, and Longchang, Renshou, and Jianyang in the South Sichuan region, have all called on believers to actively participate in labor production in order to achieve self-reliance. Christians in Jianyang County are raising funds to purchase cotton gins, cotton combers, etc., to implement self-reliance through production. Most Christian churches in Chengdu have formulated self-reliance plans. Pastors are also prepared to voluntarily reduce their salaries and tighten church expenditures. Some pastors and other church workers have also engaged in weaving and knitting socks, and their income can support themselves. The Sichuan Conference of the Church of Christ in China has also put forward the self-reliance policy of "preaching without forgetting production."

　　基督教革新运动遍及西南各地
    教徒积极准备实行生产自养
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：基督教革新运动已遍及西南各地，若干和帝国主义割断经济关系的教会正积极准备实行自养。西南区重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳、雅安、南充、岳池、广元、江津、崇宁、昭通、康定等七十六个市、县的基督教徒，在革新运动中先后举行了各种座谈会、革新运动大会、时事学习会及反美爱国控诉大会。经过这些会议后，教徒们逐渐认清帝国主义利用教会侵略我国的罪行，政治觉悟日渐提高。现各地基督教徒为实行自养，正准备或已经参加劳动生产。川北区岳池、营山及川南区隆昌、仁寿、简阳等县基督教会，都号召教徒们积极参加劳动生产，以求自力更生。简阳县教徒正筹措款项，准备购置轧花机、梳花机等，实行生产自养。成都市各基督教会大部已订立了自养计划。牧师们也准备自动降低薪资，紧缩教会开支。有的牧师和其他教会工作人员并已从事织布、织袜等劳动，收入可自养。中华基督教会四川大会也提出了“布道不忘生产”的自养方针。
