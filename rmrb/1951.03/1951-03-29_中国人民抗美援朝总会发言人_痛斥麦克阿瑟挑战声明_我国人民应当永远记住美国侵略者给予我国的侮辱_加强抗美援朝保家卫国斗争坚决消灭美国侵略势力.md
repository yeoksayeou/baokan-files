Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The spokesperson of the China Peace Committee (China People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters) issued a statement today regarding MacArthur's challenging statement on March 24th, saying: "MacArthur, the culprit of the aggression against Korea, issued a statement on March 24th that insults the people of China and Korea. He arrogantly demanded that the Chinese and Korean People's Forces negotiate with him to submit to American aggression, and threatened the Chinese people that the American and British aggression forces would attack the People's Republic of China. MacArthur's shameless bragging, although as worthless as his previous bragging and will soon go bankrupt as it did in the past, is not worth a smile; however, MacArthur's declaration that the American and British aggression forces are prepared to directly invade our country is a serious matter, and our people cannot but pay close attention to it. From the very beginning of the aggression against Korea by the United States, Britain, and other countries, we pointed out that the target of the aggressors was China, so the Chinese people cannot ignore the Korean situation. Now, it is very clear: as long as the United Nations does not revoke its shameless resolution condemning our country as an aggressor, and as long as the American aggressors and their accomplices refuse the reasonable demands of our country and other countries regarding the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the withdrawal of American forces from Taiwan, then MacArthur and the American aggressors will inevitably attempt to make the war of aggression prolonged and expanded. Therefore, all our people must heighten their vigilance, strengthen the sacred struggle to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, until we, together with the Korean people, liberate all of Korea and drive the aggressors who deliberately intend to invade our country out of Korea. All compatriots across the country should forever remember the insults inflicted upon our country by the United Nations and the American aggressors, and be determined to unite and fight for the final elimination of imperialist aggression forces in China and Korea."

　　中国人民抗美援朝总会发言人
    痛斥麦克阿瑟挑战声明           
    我国人民应当永远记住美国侵略者给予我国的侮辱
    加强抗美援朝保家卫国斗争坚决消灭美国侵略势力
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会（中国人民抗美援朝总会）发言人本日就麦克阿瑟三月二十四日的挑战声明发表谈话说：“侵略朝鲜的罪魁麦克阿瑟三月二十四日发表侮辱中朝两国人民的声明，竟然狂妄地要求中朝人民部队向他作服从美国侵略的谈判，并恐吓中国人民说美英侵略军将要进攻中华人民共和国。麦克阿瑟声明中的无耻吹牛，虽然和他过去多次的吹牛一样，不值一笑，而且不久自会和过去一样地破产；但是麦克阿瑟关于美英侵略军准备直接侵略我国的宣言，却是一件严重的事实，我国人民不能不加以密切注意。我们从美英等国侵略朝鲜之初，就指明侵略者的目标是指向中国的，所以中国人民对于朝鲜形势断然不能置之不理。现在事情很明显：只要联合国不撤消它的谴责我国为侵略者的无耻决议，只要美国侵略者及其帮凶们拒绝我国和其他国家关于和平调处朝鲜问题和美国武力撤出台湾问题的合理主张，那么，麦克阿瑟和美国侵略者就势必企图使侵略战争持久化和扩大化。因此，我全国人民务须提高警惕，加强抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争，直至和朝鲜人民在一起解放全朝鲜，将蓄意侵略我国的侵略者逐出朝鲜为止。全国同胞，都应当永远记住联合国和美国侵略者给予我国的侮辱，下定决心，为在中国和朝鲜最后消灭帝国主义侵略势力而一致奋斗。”
