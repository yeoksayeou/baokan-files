　　Before and After the Implementation of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries in Yongqing County, Hebei Province
　　Qu Shizhen, Han Kun
　　After the promulgation of the "Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries," the Yongqing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province organized all county and district cadres to study and discuss it. It also mobilized Chinese Communist Party rural branch members and reading group members to study. The results of the study and discussion led the county and district cadres to criticize their past right-leaning tendencies. In the countryside, due to the in-depth publicity by party members and reading group members, village-level cadres and some farmers recognized the necessity of suppressing counterrevolutionaries. People from all walks of life rose up to accuse and denounce them. In just five days, the government and the Public Security Bureau received more than one hundred letters from the masses accusing and exposing the crimes of counterrevolutionary elements. They demanded the arrest and severe punishment of the most heinous counterrevolutionary elements.
　　These demands of the masses are justified. In the past stage, counterrevolutionary elements in Yongqing County were still quite rampant. For example, more than twenty bandits and secret agents who had fled back after the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin had not been given appropriate control, and habitual bandits who had historically committed murder and robbery were still at large. They colluded with each other, seized our militia's guns, and murdered our cadres. Revolutionary order was affected, and the people's productive enthusiasm was uneasy. The people's government's suppression of counterrevolutionary elements was not firm enough, and the masses expressed dissatisfaction with this.
　　Now, the Yongqing County People's Government has accepted the accusations of the people, and after careful study based on existing materials, and taking the "Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries" as the criterion, arrested most of the incorrigible counterrevolutionary elements on March 3rd. Individual escapees were also captured one by one with the vigorous assistance of the broad masses of the people. For example, Li Shuchun, the reactionary leader of Xiaoliutuo Village, fled to Nandawangmiao Village the night he heard of our arrest, and was reported by the masses the next morning and captured by the militia.
　　The day after the arrest of counterrevolutionary elements, the people in the city and major market towns gathered automatically to accuse them of their crimes. Huan Geng, a farmer from Chengguan, said: "They should have been arrested and severely punished long ago. If they are not punished, the people will not be able to engage in production with peace of mind!" Everywhere in the city and countryside, one could hear the masses praising the government's wise measures. "Demanding that the government severely punish all counterrevolutionary elements who refuse to repent" has become the voice of the broad masses of the people.
　　After the arrest of the main counterrevolutionary elements, people who had served the enemy and puppets and who were usually dishonest bowed their heads to the people, awed by the power of the people's government. Those who had resisted going to *chungi gong* (water conservancy spring repair project conscripted labor - abbreviated as *chungi gong*) a few days ago now actively demanded to participate, enabling the mobilization work to proceed smoothly. From mid-February to March 2, Nanguan Town only organized more than eighty *chungi gong*. After the arrest of four main counterrevolutionary elements, including Nan Shuting, in the town, more than one hundred and twenty people were organized the next day. Those who had served in the puppet army in the past have changed from panic to actively participating in production after in-depth publicity of the policy of combining suppression and leniency. Xu Wenzhang, who had served in the puppet army in the past, found our staff member and said: "I will actively participate in production in the future, pay public grain, and go to *mingong* (civilian labor). I guarantee not to be picky and not to fall behind."

　　河北省永清县执行惩治反革命条例前后
    区士珍·韩堃
    《惩治反革命条例》公布后，中国共产党河北省永清县委员会组织了全体县、区干部进行了学习与讨论，又发动中国共产党农村支部党员与读报组员进行了学习。学习、讨论的结果，使县、区干部批判了过去工作中的右倾偏向；在农村中，由于党员、读报组员的深入宣传，使村级干部及部分农民认识到镇压反革命的必要。各阶层人民，纷起控诉，仅五天中，政府及公安局即收到一百余件群众控诉、揭发反革命分子罪恶的信件。他们要求逮捕严办罪大恶极的反革命分子。
    群众的这些要求是正当的。过去这一阶段，永清县的反革命分子依然相当猖獗。如北平、天津解放后逃回的二十多个土匪、特务，还未给以适当的管制，历来杀人、劫路的惯匪，仍逍遥法外。他们互相勾结，夺我民兵枪枝、谋杀我干部。革命秩序受到影响，人民生产情绪不得安宁。人民政府对反革命分子的镇压还不够坚决，群众对此表示不满。
    现在，永清县人民政府接受了人民的控诉，根据现有材料，详加研究之后，以《惩治反革命条例》为准绳，于三月三日逮捕了绝大部分怙恶不悛的反革命分子。个别漏网者，也在广大人民奋力协助下，一一捉回。如小柳坨村反动道首李树椿，闻我逮捕连夜逃至南大王庙村，第二天天明被群众检举，为民兵捕获。
    逮捕反革命分子后的次日，城内及各大集镇人民纷纷自动集会，控诉反革命分子的罪恶。城关农民焕更说：“他们这样的早就该抓起来严办。要不惩治他们，人民就不能安心生产！”城内、乡村，到处都可听见群众对政府这一英明措施的颂扬。“要求政府严惩一切死不改悔的反革命分子”，已成为广大人民的呼声。
    逮捕首要反革命分子后，一般曾给敌伪供职而平时又不老实的人，慑于人民政府的威力，向人民低了头。前几天还对抗出春工（水利春修工程民工—简称春工）的，现在积极要求参加了，使动员工作得以顺利进行。南关镇自二月中旬至三月二日止，只组织起春工八十余名。这次在该镇逮捕了南树亭等四名首要反革命分子后，第二日即组织起一百二十余人。过去当过伪军的，在深入宣传镇压与宽大相结合的政策后，由恐慌变为积极参加生产了。过去当过伪军的徐文章找到我工作人员说：“我以后要积极参加生产，缴公粮、出民工等，我保证不挑皮，不落后。”
