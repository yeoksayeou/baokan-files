　　Chifeng Mongolian and Hui Nationalities Demonstration Rally
    Cables Chairman Mao Expressing Resolve to Resist America and Aid Korea
    [Reported by this newspaper] Over two thousand six hundred people of the Mongolian and Hui minorities in Chifeng City held a demonstration rally on March 11th to resist America and aid Korea and oppose the United States rearming Japan, and sent a cable to Chairman Mao. The cable is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    Today, over two thousand six hundred people of the Mongolian and Hui minorities in Chifeng City held a demonstration rally to resist America and aid Korea and oppose American imperialism rearming Japan. We deeply feel that under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, ethnic minorities had no status and lived a life of suffering. During the period of Japanese invaders and Kuomintang rule, we were seized and forced into labor; we have always suffered economic exploitation, with no jobs or means of survival. In 1946, American-Chiang planes bombed our homes, killing and wounding our loved ones. How can we forget this deep hatred! Since the arrival of the Communist Party and the establishment of the People's Government, especially since the birth of the People's Republic of China, our political status has been greatly improved. We have our own representatives in the People's Congress, our interests are protected by the government, and our customs and habits are respected by all fraternal nationalities. We have truly become members of a democratic, equal, and united family. In order to defend our victorious achievements, we must resolutely resist America and aid Korea, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and resolutely struggle against American imperialism rearming Japan and unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan. The five patriotic covenants unanimously adopted by us are the direction of our future actions. We express to you that we will forever join hands with all fraternal nationalities under the banner of great patriotism and march forward.

　　赤峰蒙回民族示威游行大会
    电毛主席表示抗美援朝决心
    【本报讯】赤峰市蒙回少数民族两千六百多人，于三月十一日举行的抗美援朝反对美国重新武装日本示威游行大会，致电毛主席。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    今天赤峰市蒙回少数民族两千六百多人举行了抗美援朝反对美帝国主义重新武装日本示威游行大会。我们深深感到在帝国主义和国民党的统治下，少数民族没有地位，而且又过着痛苦的生活。日寇及国民党统治的时期，我们被抓去充劳工；我们从来就遭受着经济上的剥削，没有职业和生路。一九四六年美蒋飞机炸毁了我们的家园，炸死炸伤我们的亲人，这深仇大恨怎能忘记！自从共产党来到和人民政府成立后，特别是中华人民共和国诞生以来，我们的政治地位大大地提高，在人民代表会议中有了自己的代表，我们的利益得到政府的保护，风俗习惯受到各兄弟民族的尊重，我们真正成了民主平等团结的大家庭的一员。为了保卫自己的胜利果实，我们一定坚决抗美援助，支援中国人民志愿军，并为反对美帝国主义重新武装日本和单独对日媾和而坚决斗争。我们一致庄严通过的五项爱国公约，就是我们今后行动的方向。我们向您表示，我们要在伟大爱国主义的旗帜下永远和各兄弟民族携手前进。
  赤峰市蒙回民族抗美援朝反对美帝国主义武装日本示威游行大会
                三月十一日
