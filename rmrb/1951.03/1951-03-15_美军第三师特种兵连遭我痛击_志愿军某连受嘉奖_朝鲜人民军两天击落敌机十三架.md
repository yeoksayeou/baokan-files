Xinhua News Agency, Han River Front, March 14th: The Third Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was awarded a commendation by the Volunteer Army leadership for inflicting a serious blow on the special forces company of the US invading army's Third Division.

　　At 3:00 PM on January 18th, over 150 soldiers of the US invading army's Third Division special forces company, in nine cars and three tanks, crept towards the position of the Third Company, First Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at Jinliangchangli. The Volunteer Army waited until all the enemies had entered the firing range before firing fiercely at the enemies in the cars with machine guns. The enemies jumped out of the cars in a panic and hid beside the road. The enemy tanks then returned fire at the Volunteer Army. After half an hour of fierce fighting, more than 20 enemies were killed or wounded, and the rest retreated in panic, howling. Chen Dashun, a machine gunner in the Fifth Squad of the Volunteer Army's Third Company, was the first to destroy one of the enemy's cars. At this time, the company's firepower wove into a tight net, firing at the enemy. Enemies scrambling to climb into the cars to escape were shot and killed one after another. One enemy climbed onto a car and was contacting the rear with a radio when he was shot dead by a Volunteer Army soldier and fell on the radio.

　　Under the fierce attack of the Volunteer Army, the enemies became even more panicked. At first, they used people to pull the corpses and stuff them into the tanks, but then they hid in the tanks and used ropes to drag the corpses into the tanks. After the tanks were filled, they piled the corpses on the steel armor of the tanks. The living also scrambled to get into the tanks, and those who couldn't get in desperately climbed onto the tanks. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy abandoned all the cars and fled in a panic in three tanks.

　　In this battle, the Third Company of the Volunteer Army killed or wounded more than 50 enemies, captured one enemy alive, and seized seven cars and a large number of weapons.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 14th, Pyongyang: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army issued a war report on March 13th stating that the People's Army units shot down twelve enemy planes in the Seoul area on March 12th. On March 13th, the People's Army guard troops on the west coast shot down one enemy plane.

　　美军第三师特种兵连遭我痛击
    志愿军某连受嘉奖
    朝鲜人民军两天击落敌机十三架
    【新华社汉江前线十四日电】中国人民志愿军某部第三连，因为给了美国侵略军第三师特种兵连以严重打击，荣获志愿军领导机关通令嘉奖。
    一月十八日午后三时，美国侵略军第三师特种兵连一百五十余人，分乘汽车九辆、坦克三辆，向金良场里中国人民志愿军某部第一营第三连阵地窜犯。志愿军等到敌人全部进入火力圈后，用机枪向汽车上的敌人猛射。敌人慌忙跳车，躲伏在公路旁。敌人的坦克则以炮火向志愿军还击。经过半小时激战，敌人被打死打伤二十多人，其余的惊慌地嚎叫着，向后退却。志愿军三连第五班机枪射手陈大顺首先打坏了敌人当中的一辆汽车。这时全连的火器交织成严密火网，向敌人发射。争着爬车逃命的敌人纷纷被打死。有一个敌人爬上了一部汽车，正在用报话机和后方联络时，被志愿军一枪打死，倒在发报机上。
    在志愿军猛烈打击之下，敌人更加慌张了。他们起初用人来拉死尸，往坦克里塞，这时他们就躲在坦克里，用绳子把尸体往坦克里拖，在坦克里面塞满后，就堆在坦克的钢甲上。活人也抢着往坦克里面钻，钻不进去的就拚命爬在坦克上。经过两小时激战，敌人丢下了全部汽车，乘着三辆坦克狼狈逃窜。
    在这次战斗中，志愿军第三连打死打伤了敌人五十多名，活捉敌人一名，并缴获了汽车七辆和大批武器。
    【新华社十四日讯】平壤讯：朝鲜人民军总司令部三月十三日发表战报称：人民军部队三月十二日在汉城地区击落敌机十二架。三月十三日，西海岸人民军守卫部队击落敌机一架。
