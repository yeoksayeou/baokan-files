    Liu Yufu Painstakingly Modified the Rock Drill
    To the Editor:
    The rock drills at the Yantai Coal Mine in Liaodong, Northeast China, often leaked air due to prolonged use, resulting in weak power and difficulty in mining coal. The old rock drills were constantly malfunctioning, requiring repairs several times a day, which significantly delayed work. New rock drills were unavailable for purchase, which became a major production problem for the mine.
    Liu Yufu, the lathe foreman of the Mechanical Plant in the Engineering Section, always wanted to modify the rock drills. Wu, the head of the Engineering Section, disagreed, saying, "Even the Northeast Machinery Bureau can't do it, how could we!". But Liu Yufu did not abandon his plan. After studying for a long time, he came up with the idea of grinding the rock drills with a grinding wheel and drew a sketch to discuss with Section Chief Wu. Section Chief Wu still shook his head in opposition.
    Last December, Liu Yufu went out with the purchasing agent of the Supply and Marketing Section to buy materials. With the consent of the purchasing agent, he spent one million Northeast currency to buy ten one-and-a-half-inch grinding wheels, preparing to grind the rock drills upon his return. After returning, Section Chief Wu said he was wasting money. Liu Yufu was so frightened that he dared not start the experiment.
    Last year, when the mine inspected its work, it discovered this problem. The mine director supported Liu Yufu's idea and encouraged him to experiment. After one failure, Liu Yufu successfully modified a discarded rock drill on his second attempt. The modified rock drill was tested for half a month, and the coal mining efficiency increased by more than 15%. Now Liu Yufu is preparing to modify all the discarded and malfunctioning rock drills in the mine.

    Editor's note: There are two attitudes towards the creative inventions of the working class in various places: one is like Liu Hesh, chairman of the trade union of the printing factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, and the mine director of the Yantai Coal Mine. They give enthusiastic support and encouragement to the workers' creative desires, and even when their own factory has difficulties that cannot be solved, they reflect the situation in the newspapers and request help from relevant authorities. The other is like Wu, the head of the Engineering Section of the Yantai Coal Mine, who closes his eyes, does not see the wisdom and talent of the working class, and says that workers are "wasteful" and "fooling around." This behavior of suppressing the creative enthusiasm of the workers should be resolutely opposed.

### 刘玉绂苦心改造了风镐

    刘玉绂苦心改造了风镐编辑同志：
    东北辽东烟台煤矿的风镐因为用得太久了，常常跑风，力量小，打不下煤来。旧风镐不断出毛病，一天得修理好几次，耽误工作不少。而新风镐又买不着，这就成了矿里生产中的大问题。
    工务科机械厂车工班长刘玉绂总想把风镐改制一下。工务科吴科长却不同意，他说：“东北机械局都做不了，咱们还行！”。但刘玉绂并没有放弃他的计划。他研究好久，想出用砂轮磨制风镐的办法，就画好草图找吴科长商量。吴科长还是摇头反对。
    去年十二月，刘玉绂和供销科采买员一同出去买材料。他取得采买员的同意，用一百万元东北币买了十个一寸半的砂轮，准备回来磨风镐。回来后，吴科长就说他浪费金钱。吓得刘玉绂也不敢动手试验了。
    去年矿里检查工作时，发现了这个问题。矿长就支持刘玉绂的意见，鼓励他试验。刘玉绂经过一次失败，第二次就把一个废风镐改制好了。将改制的风镐试用了半个月，使采煤效率提高了百分之十五以上。现在刘玉绂正准备把矿内所有作废的和不好使的风镐全部改造一下。

    编者按：对待工人阶级的创造发明，各地存在着两种态度：一种是，像华北军区政治部印刷厂工会主席刘何士和烟台煤矿矿长那样。他们对工人的创造欲望给予热烈的支持和鼓励，甚至在本厂有困难无法解决的时候，则把情况反映在报纸上，要求有关机关给以帮助。另一种是，像烟台煤矿工务科吴科长那样，他们闭着眼睛，看不见工人阶级的智慧和才能，说工人是“浪费”，“胡闹”。打击工人的创造热情，这种行为应该受到坚决的反对。
