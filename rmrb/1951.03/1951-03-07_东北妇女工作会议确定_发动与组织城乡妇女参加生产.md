The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation convened a joint meeting of directors of provincial and municipal Democratic Women's Federations and female worker department heads of trade unions on February 16th. The meeting mainly summarized the work of 1950 and studied and arranged future work.

Over the past year, the Democratic Women's Federations at all levels in the Northeast, under the leadership of the Party, have played a significant role in mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in economic construction and national defense construction.

Female factory workers, like their male counterparts, enthusiastically participated in the patriotic production emulation drive and demonstrated even greater activism in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. More than 3,000 production models emerged in Shenyang, with women accounting for one-tenth of them. In rural areas, women participating in agricultural auxiliary labor and main labor, from spring plowing to autumn harvest, accounted for 60 percent of the total number of women in the labor force. According to statistics from the provinces of Rehe, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, 40 to 50 percent participated in spring plowing, 70 to 80 percent participated in summer weeding, and more than 90 percent participated in autumn harvest. They all enthusiastically studied agricultural production techniques, and those who were physically stronger also participated in mutual aid teams. As a result of women's participation in agricultural production, the busy farming season was shortened in each season, and a large number of male laborers were freed up to engage in sideline production.

After the start of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Democratic Women's Federations at all levels, in cooperation with the trade unions, vigorously carried out work among the families of workers and staff (hereinafter referred to as "workers' families") on the basis of the past. In the city of Dalian alone, more than 20,000 households were organized out of more than 60,000 workers' families. Workers' families living scattered were also organized into street women's associations, and workers' family committees were established to regularly study current affairs and improve political awareness.

Regarding maternal and child welfare, the Democratic Women's Federations at all levels assisted the health departments in reforming 19,328 old-style midwives. 241 urban health stations and 331 rural delivery stations were established. In addition, there were 263 nurseries.

Based on the current situation, the meeting decided:

(1) Regarding the work of female workers, it is necessary to implement the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, conduct patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea for them, and continue to mobilize female workers to participate in the patriotic labor emulation drive. In 1951, all factories and mines should convene female worker representative meetings to establish and improve female worker committees in order to promote work with organizational strength. Prevent deviations such as temporary crash projects, overtime work, and extra work that disregard women's physical strength; pay attention to female workers' health care, implement labor insurance regulations and wage regulations, earnestly take care of women's interests, and appropriately solve their difficulties as possible; continue to organize female workers to participate in technical studies and master complex operation methods. In rural areas, women should be mobilized to participate in mutual aid teams based on the principles of voluntarism, mutual benefit, equal pay for equal work, and equivalent exchange.

(2) In cooperation with trade unions, strive to organize the families of workers and staff in various industrial and mining enterprises with emphasis this year, and those who have been organized should be consolidated. Use publicity methods that are popular with the masses to educate women to love the motherland and hate the enemy, explain the government's policies and decrees, make them concerned about government work, and use concrete and vivid facts to promote the principles of equality between men and women. Women's representative meetings should assist local governments and factories in completing current work.

(3) In addition to continuing to adhere to the working policy of focusing on female workers and workers' families in cities and working women in rural areas, we should unite the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and all other patriotic women, so that women from all democratic classes, democratic parties, and industries can participate in the ranks of women's struggle and form a broad united front of patriotic women to jointly participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and oppose the U.S. imperialist arming of Japan.

(4) Prepare to train 1,200 to 2,000 incumbent cadres at the county and district levels. For street and district women activists who cannot leave production, short-term training courses should be conducted by apprenticing or combining with practical work. Carefully cultivate female labor models, constantly provide them with education, support them, and establish women's flags in various work positions. (Attached picture)

　　东北妇女工作会议确定
    发动与组织城乡妇女参加生产
    东北民主妇女联合会，于二月十六日召开各省市民主妇女联合会主任、工会女工部长联席会议。会上主要是总结了一九五○年的工作，研究与布置了今后工作。
    一年来，东北各地民主妇女联合会在党的领导下，在发动广大妇女群众参加经济建设和国防建设上，起了很大作用。
    工厂女工和男工一样，热烈地参加了爱国主义生产竞赛，在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，表现得更为积极，沈阳市有三千余名生产模范，其中妇女占十分之一。在农村从春耕到秋收，妇女参加农业的辅助劳动与主要劳动者，占有劳动力妇女总数百分之六十。据热河、黑龙江、吉林省的统计，参加春耕者有百分之四十到五十，参加夏锄者有百分之七十到八十，参加秋收者有百分之九十以上。她们都热心的学习农业生产技术，身体较强者还参加了互助组。由于妇女参加了农业生产的结果，缩短了每个季节的农忙期，节省出大批男劳动力搞副业生产。
    抗美援朝开始后，各级民主妇女联合会配合工会在过去的基础上大力开展了职工家属工作（以下简称工属），仅旅大市在六万余户工属中，组织起的即有两万余户，分散居住的工属也都组织到街道妇女会中去，成立了职工家属委员会，经常学习时事提高政治觉悟。
    关于妇婴福利事业，各级民主妇女联合会协助卫生部门，改造了旧产婆一万九千三百二十八人。建立城市保健站二百四十一个，农村接产站三百三十一个。此外，托儿所有二六三个。
    根据目前的情况，会议决定：
    （一）对女工工作要贯彻中华全国总工会和东北总工会的指示，对她们进行抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，继续发动女工参加爱国主义劳动竞赛，在一九五一年内，各厂矿要召开女工代表会议，建立与健全女工委员会，以便用组织力量推动工作。防止不顾妇女体力的一时突击，加班加点的偏差；注意女工卫生保健，贯彻劳动保险条例及工资条例，认真照顾妇女利益，并根据可能，适当地解决其困难；继续组织女工参加技术学习，掌握复杂的操作法。在农村应根据自愿两利、同工同酬、等价交换的原则，发动妇女参加互助组。
    （二）配合工会，争取在今年内有重点地把各种工矿职工家属组织起来，已组织起来者则应加以巩固。利用为群众喜见乐闻的宣传方式，教育妇女们热爱祖国，憎恨敌人，解释政府的政策法令，使其关心政府工作，用具体生动的事实，宣传男女平等的道理。妇女代表会应协助各地政府、工厂完成当前工作。
    （三）除继续坚持城市以女工和工人家属为主，乡村以劳动妇女为主的工作方针外，应团结小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他一切爱国妇女，使各民主阶层、各民主党派、各行业的妇女都能参加到妇女战斗的行列里来，形成一种广泛的妇女爱国统一战线，共同参加抗美援朝、反对美帝武装日本的运动。
    （四）准备训练县、区在职干部一千二百名到两千名。对不能脱离生产的街、区妇女积极分子，应以带徒弟或结合实际工作开办短期训练班。慎重地培养妇女劳动模范，不断地给以教育，扶植、树立妇女在各种工作岗位上的旗帜。（附图片）
