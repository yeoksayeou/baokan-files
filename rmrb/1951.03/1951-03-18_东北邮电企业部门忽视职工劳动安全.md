Title: Northeastern Postal and Telecommunications Enterprises Neglect Employee Labor Safety

To the Editors:

    Currently, the working conditions of employees in postal and telecommunications enterprises in the Northeast region are very poor, with a morbidity rate of 30% according to incomplete statistics. In Qiqihar, the morbidity rate among postal and telecommunications employees is over 50%.

    As of November 1950, there were 88 employees in the entire Northeast region who had been unable to work for more than three months due to illness. Lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, and neurasthenia are the most common illnesses among postal and telecommunications employees. Among the 500+ employees in Qiqihar, as many as 30 suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis.

    As the morbidity rate gradually increased, the attendance rate also relatively decreased. In May 1950, 665 employees in the entire region had taken sick leave, and by August, this had increased to 902. The total number of sick leave days in the entire region in 1950 was equivalent to 244 employees not working for the entire year.

    The main reasons for employees falling ill are that working hours are generally too long, with most employees working more than 12 hours a day. For example, mail carriers at the Shenyang City Post Office arrive at the office at 5:30 AM every morning and cannot return home until 8:00 PM. Furthermore, for six days each month, they need to come to the office at 4:00 AM to sort out funds due to collecting newspaper fees. Telephone operators at the Shenyang City Telephone Bureau work continuously for eight hours a day, which is too much for them to handle (telephone operators in Beijing now work for one and a half hours and rest for 20 minutes, or at most work for three and a half hours and rest for half an hour). The above situation is even more serious in third and fourth-class small offices. For example, some delivery workers in Shanhaiguan have to travel more than 100 li a day, and some small offices even have difficulty granting maternity leave or leave for weddings and funerals because there are no reserve personnel.

    The dormitory conditions for postal and telecommunications employees in the Northeast region are also very poor, with 30 to 40 people crammed into one large room. Generally, there is nothing other than a sleeping platform (mostly a communal platform). In second, third, and fourth-class postal and telecommunications offices, many do not have dormitories, and the office desk serves as a bed. Some postal and telecommunications offices do not even provide spittoons, and there are too few sanitation workers. For example, the Shenyang Telephone Bureau is a four-story building with over 100 rooms, but there are only three maintenance workers. As a result, the work rooms are covered in thick dust, which is harmful to both people and machines.

    Currently, overtime work and rush projects are very serious in the Northeast postal and telecommunications departments, and generally there is no overtime pay.

    Despite the severity of employee illnesses, the administration has not paid medical expenses according to the government-stipulated standards. The Northeast People's Government stipulates that employee medical expenses should be 4% of wages, but the Postal and Telecommunications Administration allocates only 5 fen (the wage unit in the Northeast) per person, which is equivalent to just over 3% of wages. In terms of medical facilities, the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Department only has a chronic sanatorium with a capacity of 100 beds (this sanatorium was established last November with the help of a 600 million (Northeast currency) labor insurance fund allocated by the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions after it inspected the work of the Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union). In addition, there is only one hospital with relatively good equipment in Changchun. There are five clinics in the provincial capitals, but the equipment is very simple, and workers complain, "Serious illnesses cannot be cured, and minor illnesses are not treated well." Regarding labor protection, workers in the power room and parcel room and other outdoor workers requested masks, but the administration delayed resolving the issue. The reason given was that there was no budget, and requests were made at each level, and official documents took a long time to circulate. As a result, in many places the problem was solved by the trade union.

    Because of long working hours and poor labor protection, the health, labor enthusiasm, and creativity of postal and telecommunications employees in the Northeast region have been seriously affected. As a result, production competitions cannot be launched in some areas. These situations should attract the attention of relevant departments.

    Editor's Note: If the situation reflected by reader Lu Xiangxian is true, the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Enterprises Department should conduct a deep self-criticism.

### 东北邮电企业部门忽视职工劳动安全

    东北邮电企业部门忽视职工劳动安全编辑同志：
    目前东北区邮电企业中职工的劳动条件很差，患病率据不完全统计达百分之三十。齐齐哈尔邮电职工患病的达百分之五十以上。
    东北全区因病不能工作在三个月以上的职工，到一九五○年十一月止有八十八名。肺病、肠胃病和神经衰弱症是邮电部门职工最普遍的病。齐齐哈尔五百多职工中患肺结核者即有三十人之多。
    因为患病率逐渐增加、出勤率也相对降低。一九五○年五月份全区请过病假的职工六百六十五人，到八月即增为九百○二人。全区一九五○年全年病假日数，等于二百四十四名职工全年不做工作。
    造成员工生病的原因，主要是工作时间普遍太长，大部职工每天工作十二小时以上。如沈阳市邮局邮递员每天早上五点半就到局工作，直到晚八时才能回家；并且每月还有六天因收报费关系，需要早上四点就来局整理款项。沈阳市报话局话务员，每天连续不断工作八小时，这对话务员来说是吃不消的（现在北京的话务员有的工作一小时半休息二十分钟，最多是工作三小时半休息半小时）。以上情况在三、四等小局更严重，如山海关有些投递员一天要跑一百多里地，还有些小局子里连请生育假，请婚、丧假等都困难，原因是没有预备人员。
    东北区邮电职工的宿舍条件也很差，一间大屋子挤上三四十人，一般除了铺板（大多是通铺）没有其他家具。在二、三、四等邮电局中很多没有宿舍，办公桌就是床铺。有的邮电局甚至不设痰盂，管理清洁工作人员也太少。如沈阳报话局是四层楼房，共有一百多间房子，只有三个工务员。因此工作房积土很厚，这对人和机器都是有害的。
    现在东北邮电部门中，加班加点突击现象很严重，一般且没有加班费。
    尽管职工疾病情况这样严重，但行政上并没有按照政府规定的医药费标准来支付。东北人民政府规定职工医药费为工资百分之四；但邮电管理局却按每人五分（东北的工资单位）拨给，合工资百分之三点多。在医疗设备方面，东北邮电部只有一个能容纳一百张病床的慢性疗养所（这个疗养所还是在去年十一月间东北总工会去检查邮电工会工作后，由东北总工会拨出六亿元（东北币）劳动保险基金帮助建立起来的）。此外只有长春有一个设备较好的医院，各省会所在地共有医务所五个，设备都很简陋，工人反映：“大病治不了，小病治不好”。在劳动保护方面，动力室及包裹间等室外工人要求发口罩，行政方面也拖延不解决。原因是没有预算，层层请示，公文来往就拖了很久。结果很多地方是由工会给解决了。
    因为工时长，劳动保护差，严重地影响了东北区邮电职工的健康及劳动积极性与创造性的发挥，因此，目前部分地区生产竞赛已搞不起来了。这些情况希望能引起有关部门的注意。

    编者按：读者陆象贤所反映的情况如果属实，东北邮电企业部门应作深刻检讨。
