Counter-revolutionary Elements Lurk and Sabotage Production: Nanjing Radio Factory and Others Suffer Severe Losses
　　Workers Angrily Report, Demanding Severe Punishment; Pacifist Ideas and Complacency are Powerfully Criticized.
　　In the work of registering reactionary party, league, and secret agent personnel in factories and enterprises in Nanjing, the root causes of past production sabotage and obstacles to unity and progress have been found. These ironclad facts are the most profound lessons for those who harbor pacifist ideas and complacency, who think "there is no problem" and abandon the political vigilance they should have.
　　Last year, the production of the Nanjing Public Radio Factory was affected by serious rework (i.e., defects were found in finished products after they left the factory, and they had to be remade). What was the reason? The administration believed that the engineers were too incompetent, and the workers who were actively producing blamed the engineers for poor design; the engineer was also worried, constantly complaining about his lack of experience and unfamiliarity with the technology. During the rectification campaign, the factory also examined this issue, and simply believed that the main problem was insufficient planning, an unsound inspection system, and unscientific organization and force allocation. Therefore, when the study of the situation on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea began, the leaders were still busy making summaries and formulating plans. When the registration of reactionary party, league, and secret agent personnel began, the administrative leaders still thought "there is nothing in the factory," believing that as long as the issues of systems, plans, and wages were resolved in the radio factory, everything would be fine.
　　However, the fact that the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang was lurking and sabotaging answered these questions. When the factory was conducting anti-espionage studies, workers, while refuting rumors, tracked down the backward workers who had been deceived and used by the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang. After education and enlightenment, they reported Shao Xiechang. Shao Xiechang was in charge of manufacturing transformers in the third group, and the rework last year was all due to problems with the transformers. More than two hundred transformers were reworked last year. Based on the factory's technology and experience, there should have been no problem in manufacturing ordinary transformers. But where was the problem? From the more than one hundred facts reported by the masses, it can be seen that Shao Xiechang's sabotage activities started very early. As early as when the army marched into the southwest, the front line urgently needed fifty 100-watt transceivers. After the factory produced them and sent them, they were all returned. It turned out that the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang deliberately connected all the wire ends incorrectly, attempting to sabotage the military task. Last spring, the factory accepted an urgent task to manufacture 500-watt rectifier transformers. On the day before delivery, the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang, under the guise of testing, allowed backward workers to use excessively high voltage (6,000 volts was used instead of the proper 3,000 volts), continuously destroying several transformers, thus affecting the delivery. The more urgent the task, the more active the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang became. He also often used various methods to instigate backward workers to sabotage production and sow discord among the workers. As a result, the factory suffered huge losses. The value of the more than two hundred damaged transformers alone was over one hundred million yuan, and the manpower and materials wasted due to rework were several times greater. More seriously, it affected the factory's production tasks for the entire year, reduced the factory's reputation, and greatly affected the unity of the workers and their enthusiasm for production.
　　After the truth came to light, everyone suddenly realized and deeply regretted their low level of vigilance. The workers and masses were filled with anger. At the meeting exposing the crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang, the shouts of the workers and masses shook the sky, demanding that the government severely punish him. His factory badge was removed on the spot, and his trade union membership certificate was revoked.
　　In addition, after the Jiangnan Automobile Company boldly mobilized the masses, broke down concerns, and reported the secret agent Wang Cuiqing, the answers to the problems of frequent vehicle breakdowns and disunity among workers in the company were found from his crimes. In the past, the factory's vehicles often broke down one or twenty times a day, nearly half of the vehicles leaving the factory. At its worst, fifteen vehicles broke down in one hour, seriously affecting city traffic and the company's reputation. However, the leadership always believed that this was due to charcoal-fueled vehicles, but they did not know that the secret agent Wang Cuiqing was playing sabotage tricks. He used the power of feudal gangs such as "Thirteen Taibaos," "Thirty-Six Friends," and "One Hundred and Eight Generals" to carry out sabotage activities, and used and incited the dissatisfaction of backward workers to sabotage production. For example, during the winter, due to the issue of distributing cotton clothes, he incited the workers to drive the vehicles back to the factory to hold a strike. He often attacked activists, saying, "Working hard is stupid, turning over is a waste of time." He also encouraged everyone, "If there is a little problem, drive back to the factory." Therefore, it affected the production enthusiasm of some workers and caused serious breakdowns. During the Spring Festival, the internal staff challenged the external staff, proposing to guarantee timely repairs to vehicles. He deliberately took the lead in accepting the challenge, but the next day he simultaneously broke down more than ten vehicles and drove them back to the factory, making it impossible for the internal staff to cope. He also said to the external staff, "The external staff deliberately damaged the vehicles to make trouble for us." He also incited the external staff, saying, "The internal staff deliberately repaired them poorly to make us look bad." Due to Wang Cuiqing's instigation, vehicle breakdowns were frequent, affecting an average of two or three million yuan in business income per day (excluding costs), and reducing business by as much as eight hundred million yuan throughout last year. When these ironclad facts were exposed at the struggle meeting, all the workers hated this conscienceless secret agent who rode on the backs of the workers, and even backward workers such as Yu Bin, who had been used by him as henchmen in the past, stood up to accuse him of his crimes. When the Public Security Bureau accepted the masses' request to arrest him and severely punish him, the masses rushed forward and took off the worker's hat he was wearing to avoid insulting the honor of the working class.
　　Since the secret agent Wang Cuiqing was arrested, the frequent vehicle breakdowns in the factory immediately changed. On March 4th (Sunday), only one vehicle broke down and returned to the factory for repairs, and all other vehicles were dispatched.

　　反革命分子潜伏破坏生产  南京无线电厂等遭受严重损失
    职工愤怒检举，要求予以严惩；太平观念、麻痹思想，受到有力批判。
    南京市工厂企业，在反动党、团、特务人员登记工作中，找出了过去破坏生产、阻碍团结进步的根源。这些铁一样的事实，对存在太平观念、麻痹思想，认为“没有什么问题”而放弃了应有的政治警惕的人，是最深刻的教训。
    南京市公营无线电厂，去年的生产由于返工（即成品出厂后发现毛病而又重制）现象严重，曾影响了整个生产任务。原因在那里呢？行政上认为工程师太无能，积极生产的工人怪工程师设计不好；那位工程师也弄得提心吊胆，老是怨自己经验不足和技术太生疏。在整风中，该厂又检查了这个问题，也单纯认为主要问题在于计划性不够，检验制度不健全，组织和力量配备不科学。因而当抗美援朝时事学习开始后，领导还忙于做总结和订计划。反动党、团、特务人员登记开始时，行政领导干部仍认为“厂里没什么”，以为无线电厂只要制度、计划、工资问题解决，便可万事大吉。
    然而反革命分子邵协昌潜伏破坏的事实对于这些问题做了回答。该厂进行反特务学习时，职工在反谣言中追出了为反革命分子邵协昌所欺骗利用的落后职工后，经过教育和启发，他们检举了反革命分子邵协昌。邵协昌是在三组掌握制造变压器的，而去年的返工原因都是在变压器的问题上。去年返工的变压器达二百只以上，按该厂的技术和经验，制造一般的变压器是不应该有问题的。但问题却在那里呢？从群众检举的一百多条事实中可以知道：邵协昌破坏生产的活动很早就开始了。早在大军进军西南时，前线急需五十部一百瓦发报机，该厂制出送去后又全部退回，原来反革命分子邵协昌将线头全部故意接错，企图以此破坏军事任务。去年春季该厂接受制造五百瓦的整流器变压器的紧急任务，在交货前一天反革命分子邵协昌借试验为名，纵使落后工人用过高电压（本应用三千伏特的，却用了六千伏特）连续打毁了几个变压器，因而影响了交货。反革命分子邵协昌越在任务紧急时，他的活动便越厉害。他又经常用各种方式鼓动落后工人破坏生产，挑拨离间工人内部的团结。因此，使该厂遭受了巨大的损失，仅以损坏的二百多个变压器本身价值计算，即在一亿元以上，因为返工而浪费的人力、物力更要大几倍。更严重的，是影响了该厂全年的生产任务，降低了该厂的信誉，大大影响了职工的团结和生产的积极性。
    事情水落石出后，大家才恍然大悟，深悔自己警惕性太低。职工群众们气愤填膺。在反革命分子邵协昌暴露罪恶的大会上，职工群众喊声震天，要求政府严办。并当场摘下了他的厂章，追回了工会会员证。
    另外，江南汽车公司在放手发动群众，打破顾虑，检举了特务王萃卿后，从他的罪恶中，找到了该公司过去车子经常抛锚和职工不团结问题的答案。该厂过去每天出厂的车辆往往要抛锚一、二十辆，几达出厂车辆的半数，最严重时曾一小时抛锚十五辆之多，严重地影响了市内交通和公司信誉。而领导上却始终认为：这是木炭车的缘故，但不知道特务王萃卿却在进行破坏的把戏。他借了“十三太保”、“三十六友”、“一百单八将”等封建帮会的权势，进行破坏活动，利用和煽动落后工人不满情绪，来破坏生产。如冬天因发棉衣问题，即煽动工人将车子开回厂去举行怠工；平时经常打击积极分子说：“多干是傻瓜，翻身翻了个屁。”又鼓动大家：“有一点毛病即往厂里开。”因此影响了某些工人生产情绪低落，造成严重的抛锚现象。春节时内勤向外勤挑战，提出及时保证修好车辆，他故意首先应战，第二天却将十多辆车同时抛锚回厂，使内勤无法应付。他并一面对外勤说：“外勤故意弄坏车子找我们麻烦。”又煽动外勤说：“内勤故意修得不好要我们难看。”由于王萃卿的煽动，影响车子经常抛锚，平均每日影响营业收入二、三百万（不扣成本），去年全年减少营业达八亿之多。当这些铁一样的事实在斗争大会上为大家揭发后，全体职工对这一丧尽天良骑在工人头上的特务分子莫不切齿痛恨，连过去受他利用作为爪牙的落后工人如喻斌等也都起来控诉他的罪行。当公安局接受群众要求予以逮捕严惩时，群众拥上前去将他头上戴的工人帽取下，以免污辱工人阶级的荣誉。
    自从特务王萃卿被逮捕以后，该厂车辆经常抛锚的情况立即改变，三月四日（星期日）发生毛病回厂修理的仅有一辆，其余车辆均全部出动。
