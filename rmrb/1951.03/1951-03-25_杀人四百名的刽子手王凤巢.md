Wang Fengchao, Executioner Who Killed Four Hundred People
    Gong Fu

    Wang Fengchao was a Kuomintang secret agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who killed more than four hundred people and burned down more than 1,500 houses. Just as the people of central Hebei were seeking him to settle the blood debt, this heinous secret agent was again committing robbery and injuring victims in Beijing.

    Wang Fengchao was originally a major bandit in the Hejian area of central Hebei, specializing in assassinating people for the local despotic landlords. Fifty silver dollars was enough to buy him to kill a person. He murdered ninety-eight people in this way, including Sun Fengming.

    After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he turned to the Japanese invaders and became a traitor. In the first month of 1940, this hardcore traitor secret agent led puppet troops to massacre fifteen villages in the Hejian area, including Zhangsiying, Liugusi, and Nanduan Village. Under his personal command, they looted the farmers' grain, livestock, and all their property. But he was not satisfied and, under the pretext of "collaborating with the Eighth Route Army," ordered the puppet troops to kill more than four hundred villagers, including Ni Zhirong, with guns and bayonets. Pregnant women were disemboweled, and babies less than a year old were grabbed by their legs and torn apart alive. Corpses lay everywhere inside and outside the villages, covered in blood and flesh. This horrific massacre allowed Wang Fengchao to use the blood of his compatriots to exchange for the "official position" of the captain of the Hebei Central Security Command from the Japanese invaders. In May 1942, this executioner again led puppet troops to set fire to more than seventy villages, including Zhangsiying, Liugusi, and Beima Village, burning down more than 1,500 houses. Beima Village was reduced to rubble, and no one was seen for miles. Thousands of farmers were forced to become displaced and suffered from hunger and cold.

    After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Wang Fengchao, covered in the blood of the people, was reused by the Kuomintang reactionaries and served as the head of the ninth group of the "Patriotic Corps" of the military intelligence. Under the command of the major secret agent Diao Hairen, he not only assassinated Xu Guozheng, the village head of the liberated area, but also openly formed gangs to kidnap people in the southern suburbs of Beijing. On a dark night of May 27, 1948, he kidnapped Su Jinshi, the mother of Su Deping of Shijia Village, from her bed and took her to the cellar at No. 21, Nanzhanglufang Village, demanding a ransom of forty taels of gold for Su Deping to "redeem the ticket." But Su Deping's wife and children had already been kidnapped once by him, and where would he get the money to redeem them again? After a few days, Wang Fengchao saw that "redeeming the ticket" was impossible and became murderous. He starved Su Jinshi for more than ten days, until she was on the verge of death. Then this ruthless Wang Fengchao strangled her to death with a rope. It was not until two years and five months later that this dark little cellar was discovered. Su Jinshi's body had rotted into a pile of white bones, and the rope that strangled her that day was still faintly wrapped around her neck.

    After the liberation of Beijing, Wang Fengchao, who specialized in killing people for a living, refused to bow his head and repent. He gathered a group of secret agents and stray soldiers to continue robbing the people of their property. In March of the year before last, he pretended to be the Beijing Military Control Commission checking household registrations and broke into Sun Hongquan's house at No. 53, Shangsantiao, Huashi, outside Chongwenmen. He tied up Sun Hongquan's entire family with ropes and pressed Sun Hongquan to the ground, strangling him unconscious nine times with a rope. Although Wang Fengchao hid in Haidian Town in the western suburbs after each crime, pretending to weave willow baskets as a cover, he was finally caught and arrested. The hundreds of lives he killed can now be avenged.

　　杀人四百名的刽子手王凤巢
    宫复
    王凤巢是个蒋介石匪帮军统特务，曾经杀害了四百多人，烧毁了民房一千五百多间。被害的冀中人民，正在找他清算血债的时候，这个万恶的特务，竟在北京又连续抢劫，伤害事主。
    王凤巢本是冀中河间一带的大土匪，专门替恶霸地主打黑枪，五十块现洋就可以收买他杀害一条人命。这样被他杀害的有孙凤鸣等九十八个人。
    抗战开始以后，他又投靠日寇当汉奸。在一九四○年的正月，这个铁杆汉奸特务，带领伪军，血洗了河间一带的张四营、刘古寺、南段村等十五个村庄。这次在他亲自指挥下，抢走了农民的粮食、牲畜和所有的财物，但是，他还不满足，又以“通八路”为名，命令伪军用枪弹和刺刀杀害村民倪志荣等四百多人。怀了孕的妇女被挑破肚皮，不满周岁的小孩，被抓起两条小腿活活劈死。村里村外，到处都躺着血肉模糊的尸体。这一次惨绝人寰的大屠杀，使王凤巢用同胞的鲜血，从日寇那里换来了冀中保安司令部大队长的“官职”。一九四二年五月，这个刽子手又带着伪军，在张四营、刘古寺、北马村等七十多个村庄放火，烧毁民房一千五百多间，其中的北马村，只剩一片瓦砾，几里地内不见人烟。数千农民，被迫流离失所，受尽饥寒交迫的痛苦。
    日寇投降了，混身染满人民鲜血的王凤巢，又得到国民党反动派的重用，充当军统“报国团”第九组的特务头子。在大特务刁化仁的手下，他不仅刺杀了解放区的村长徐国正，而且在北京南郊一带，竟然公开结伙绑票。一九四八年五月二十七日的月黑夜，他把石家村苏德平的母亲苏靳氏，从被窝里绑起来就走，拉到南獐鹿房村二十一号的地窖里，回头要价四十两黄金，叫苏德平“赎票”，可是苏德平的老婆和孩子，已被他绑过一次了，那里有钱再赎？过了几天，王凤巢见“赎票”已不可能，便起了杀机，把苏靳氏饿了十多天，饿得奄奄一息的时候，这个杀人不眨眼的王凤巢，才用绳子把她勒死。事隔两年零五个月，才发现了这个阴暗的小地窖。苏靳氏的尸体已烂成一堆白骨，当日勒死她的绳子，还隐约的缠在脖子上。
    北京解放后，这个专门以杀人为生的王凤巢，丝毫不肯低头悔过。他收罗了一批特务和散兵，继续抢劫人民的财物。在前年三月间，他冒充北平市军事管制委员会查户口，闯进崇文门外花市上三条五十三号孙鸿全的家里，用绳子捆绑孙鸿全的全家，并且把孙鸿全按在地上，用绳子勒昏过九次。虽然王凤巢每次作案之后都藏到西郊海淀镇，假装编柳条筐子做掩护，但终于落网被捕。被他害死的几百条人命，现在可以报血海深仇了。
