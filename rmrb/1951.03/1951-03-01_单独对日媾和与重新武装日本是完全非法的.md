　　Separate Peace with Japan and the Rearmament of Japan are Completely Illegal

The US imperialist conspiracy of actively plotting a separate peace with Japan and rearming Japan completely violates all international agreements on the Japanese issue, overturns the main basis of the peace treaty with Japan, and is completely illegal.

The separate peace activities with Japan that US imperialism is actively carrying out completely violate the proper and legal procedures for signing a peace treaty with Japan agreed upon by the Allied countries during the war.

On January 1, 1942, the "Declaration by United Nations" (or the "Anti-Fascist Joint Declaration") signed in Washington by 26 countries including the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, expressly stipulated that "Each Government hereby pledges to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or treaty of peace with the enemies." This provision was later developed by the Potsdam Agreement.

According to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement signed on August 3, 1945, the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan should be the responsibility of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Potsdam Agreement stated at the outset: The Potsdam "Conference has agreed to establish a Council composed of the Foreign Ministers representing the five principal powers (meaning the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) to continue the necessary preparatory work for the peace settlements." The Potsdam Agreement stipulates that when the Council of Foreign Ministers prepares the peace treaty, "the Council shall be composed of the members which signed the instruments of surrender of the enemy state concerned." According to this provision, the Council of Foreign Ministers must be composed of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom when preparing the peace treaty with Japan, because the Japanese surrender document was signed in the name of these four countries.

However, since 1947, the US government has repeatedly attempted to undermine the above-mentioned legal procedures for preparing the peace treaty with Japan, attempting to monopolize the peace treaty with Japan, exclude the legitimate rights of China and the Soviet Union, and allow its conspiracy to rearm the Japanese militarist forces to proceed smoothly.

The Chinese and Soviet people are paying the greatest attention to preparing the peace treaty with Japan in accordance with legal procedures. China and the Soviet Union are both close neighbors of Japan. China is the country that fought against Japan for the longest time and made the greatest sacrifices. The Soviet Union is the decisive force that finally defeated Japan. At the same time, both China and the Soviet Union have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression for a long time. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japanese imperialism has long invaded China and is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. After September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialism intensified its armed aggression against China and finally launched a full-scale war of aggression against China on July 7, 1937. China's vast territory was ravaged, and more than 10 million people died, with losses of public and private property totaling approximately US$50 billion. Japanese imperialism is also the ferocious enemy of the Soviet people. It landed in Vladivostok shortly after the October Revolution, occupied the Primorsky Krai, and dispersed the Soviets. During the construction period of the Soviet Union, Japanese imperialism also threatened the eastern border of the Soviet Union for a long time and carried out many armed provocations. During the Soviet-German War, the main force of the Japanese Army, the Kwantung Army, was stationed on the eastern border of the Soviet Union, posing a serious threat to the Asian part of the Soviet Union. All this shows that in preparing the peace treaty with Japan, the US conspiracy to exclude China and the Soviet Union is not only completely illegal, but also unreasonable.

The US imperialist conspiracy to make a separate peace infringes on China's territories of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands; infringes on the Soviet Union's territory of southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands; conspires to continue occupying Japan and openly rearming Japan, making Japan a tool of US aggression; all of this is also completely illegal and violates the international documents signed by the US government, which are the main basis for signing the peace treaty with Japan, namely the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the Yalta Agreement of February 11, 1945, the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, and the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan passed by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947.

Regarding the territorial issue, the Cairo Declaration stated: "Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, etc. shall be restored to China." Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation reiterated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out." The Yalta Agreement stipulated: "Southern Sakhalin and all adjacent islands shall be returned to the Soviet Union," and "the Kuril Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union."

The Potsdam Proclamation and the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan both clearly stipulate that Japan is prohibited from rearming and that Japanese militarist forces must be completely eliminated. Article 6 of the Potsdam Proclamation states: "There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world." Article 12 of the Potsdam Proclamation stipulates that after a peaceful Japan is established, "the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn immediately." The Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan has more detailed and specific provisions on the demilitarization of Japan. The first part of the resolution, "Ultimate Objectives," stipulates: "To insure that Japan will not again become a menace to the peace and security of the world." "Japan will be completely disarmed and demilitarized. And the authority and influence of the militarists shall be eliminated completely from its political, economic and social life, and institutions expressive of the spirit of militarism and aggression shall be vigorously suppressed." In the third part, "Political," the title of the first section is "Disarmament and Demilitarization," which stipulates: "Disarmament and demilitarization are the initial tasks of the military occupation and should be carried out promptly and decisively. ... Japan shall not have any army, navy, air force, secret police organization, or any civil aviation, or gendarmerie, but may have appropriate non-military police."

However, as is well known, the actual policy of the US occupiers towards Japan is completely contrary to the spirit of these international agreements signed by the United States. Japanese militarist forces are being fostered, and Japanese armed forces are gradually being established under the guise of the police. The US conspiracy to make a separate peace with Japan is to make these illegal measures open, accelerated, and legalized.

The US imperialist betrayal of faith in conspiring to make a separate peace with Japan and rearm it once again demonstrates that US imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism as the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people must smash these completely illegal conspiracies of US imperialism and strive for the full fulfillment and realization of the above-mentioned international agreements.

### 单独对日媾和与重新武装日本是完全非法的

　　单独对日媾和与重新武装日本是完全非法的
    美帝国主义正在积极策动的单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋，完全违反有关对日问题的各项国际协议，推翻了对日和约的主要基础，是完全非法的。
    美帝国主义积极进行的单独对日媾和的活动，完全违反战时盟国所协议的签订对日和约的正当的与合法的程序。
    一九四二年一月一日，苏、中、美、英等二十六个国家在华盛顿签署的联合国宣言（或称反法西斯联合宣言），曾经明文规定：“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定或和约。”这一规定以后又为波茨坦协定所发挥。
    根据一九四五年八月三日签署的波茨坦协定的原则，对日和约应由苏、中、美、英四国外长会议负责准备。波茨坦协定开宗明义地说：波茨坦“会议商获协议设立一外长会议，代表五主要国家（按指苏、中、美、英、法）继续进行和约的必要准备工作”。波茨坦协定规定：外长会议在准备和约时，“会议将由在有关敌国投降书上签字之会员国组成之”。根据这一规定，外长会议在准备对日和约时，必须由苏、中、美、英四国组成之，因为日本投降书就是以这四个国家的名义签署的。
    可是，自一九四七年以来，美国政府曾屡次企图破坏上述合法的准备对日和约的程序，妄图由其一手包办对日和约，排除中国与苏联的合法权利，使其重新武装日本军国主义势力的阴谋得以顺利进行。
    中国人民与苏联人民以最大的注意力关怀着按照合法程序准备对日和约。中苏两国都是日本的邻国，关系密切，中国是对日作战最久、牺牲最大的国家，苏联是最后击败日本的决定力量，同时中苏两国又都曾长期身受过日本帝国主义侵略之害。自一八九四年甲午战争以来，日本帝国主义曾长期地侵略中国，是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。一九三一年九月十八日以后，日本帝国主义更加紧武装侵略中国，终于在一九三七年七月七日发动了全面的侵华战争。使中国的广大领土横遭蹂躏，人民死亡达一千万人以上，公私财产损失共约五百亿美元。日本帝国主义也是苏联人民的凶恶敌人。它曾在十月革命之后不久在海参崴登陆，占领了沿海州，并驱散了苏维埃。在苏联进行建设时期，日本帝国主义也曾长期地威胁着苏联的东部边疆，多次地进行过武装挑衅。在苏德战争期间，日本陆军的主力关东军，一直陈兵苏联的东部边境，对苏联的亚洲部分形成严重的威胁。所有这些说明：在准备对日和约时，美国阴谋排斥中苏两国，不仅是完全非法的，也是毫无道理的。
    美帝国主义策动的单独媾和阴谋侵犯中国的领土台湾及澎湖列岛；侵犯苏联的领土库页岛南部及千岛群岛；阴谋继续占领日本，公开重新武装日本，使日本充当美国的侵略工具；所有这一切也完全是非法的，是违背美国政府参加签字的国际文件的，这些文件是签订对日和约的主要基础，即一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言、一九四五年二月十一日的雅尔塔协定、一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告以及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会通过的对投降后日本之基本政策。
    关于领土问题，开罗宣言说：“满洲、台湾、澎湖列岛等归还中国”。波茨坦公告第八条曾经重申：“开罗宣言之条件必将实施”。雅尔塔协定规定：“库页岛南部及邻近一切岛屿须交还苏联”，“千岛群岛须交予苏联”。
    波茨坦公告和对投降后日本之基本政策，都明确地规定禁止日本重新武装，并彻底肃清日本军国主义势力。波茨坦公告第六条说：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界之威权及势力，必须永久铲除。盖吾人坚持非将暴乱之军国主义驱出世界，则和平、安全及正义之新秩序势不可能。”波茨坦公告第十二条规定，和平的日本建立后，“同盟国占领军队当即撤退”。对投降后日本之基本政策对日本非军国主义化有更详细与具体的规定。该决议第一部“最终目标”中规定：“保证日本不再成为世界和平与安全之威胁。”“日本应完全解除武装与军备。并完全消灭其军部权力与军国主义之影响；严格取缔一切表现军国主义与侵略精神之制度。”第三部“政治”中，第一节的题目就是“解除武装与废弃军备”，其中规定：“解除武装与废弃军备，乃军事占领之初步任务，应迅速而决然地予以完成。……日本不得再有任何陆军、海军、空军、秘密警察组织，或任何民间航空，或宪兵，但得有适当之非军事警察。”
    可是，众所周知，美国占领者对日本的实际政策，完全与这些曾由美国签字的国际协议的精神背道而驰。日本的军国主义势力正被扶植起来，日本的武装部队正在警察的外衣下被逐渐建立起来。而美国阴谋对日单独媾和，就是为了使这些非法的措施能够公开、加速和合法化。
    美帝国主义背信弃义地阴谋与日本单独媾和并重新加以武装，再一次地说明美帝国主义已代替日本帝国主义成为中国人民最凶恶的敌人。中国人民必须粉碎美帝国主义这些完全非法的阴谋计划，并争取上述各项国际协议的完全履行与实现。
