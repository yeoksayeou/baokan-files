To the Editor:

    Serious feudal oppressive acts such as withholding wages, body searches, beatings, and insults against workers still exist in the Jixian Public Pinggong Cotton Weaving Factory in Pingyuan Province.

    Since September of last year, workers' wages have been stipulated to be based on wheat, but the factory administration refuses to implement this, and still issues substandard millet to workers instead of wheat. At that time, wheat was 770 yuan per kilogram, while millet was 500 yuan per kilogram, causing significant losses to workers. Workers have repeatedly raised objections to the administration, but they have not been resolved. The administration claims the factory is losing money and frequently wants to lay off workers, leaving workers' jobs insecure. In reality, it's due to poor management, weaving summer socks in winter that can't be sold. The factory has over 10 million yuan in inventory and often keeps cash on hand without buying raw materials. Labor protection and factory hygiene are completely ignored. Lai Shangde, a worker, injured his thumb while repairing a machine and was unable to work for more than 20 days, but the administration did not provide him with wages or medical expenses.

    The feudal and barbaric "body search system" that insults workers' dignity still exists in the factory. The administration hired a person named Du Furong, who is specifically responsible for communication duties and body searches. When workers leave the factory after work every day, he frequently searches them to see if they have stolen factory thread.

    The factory's technician, Zhang Shouyi, still treats workers with oppressive methods. He often scolds workers for being "backward" and says, "You can't do without oppression." On July 5, 1950, worker Sha Fumin changed the cloth rolling gear and improved the quality. However, instead of being praised, he was suppressed. Sha Fumin originally wove plain white cloth, but Zhang Shouyi insisted on assigning him to weave 75 bedsheets. Sha Fumin was not skilled in this technique, and after working for 15 days, he earned 30 kilograms of wheat less in wages. Subsequently, Zhang Shouyi assigned him to weave colored floral cloth. This type of cloth is difficult to weave and easily breaks. After working for more than a month, he earned more than 60 kilograms of wheat less. Later, he was deliberately assigned to install new looms, which took seven days, with only food provided and no wages. Sha Fumin thought that if he didn't do it, he would not have another job, and he wouldn't even be able to afford cotton clothes in the winter, so he had to borrow 90 kilograms of wheat to replace his lined jacket.

    Zhang Shouyi also frequently oppresses and insults female workers. He has called female workers prostitutes. When a female worker is working alone, he will engage in harassment. When assigning work, Zhang Shouyi assigns the female workers who look good to easy-to-weave threads so they can earn more wages; female workers who don't look good are assigned to hard-to-weave threads. When female worker Niu Guirong went to get weft tubes to spin thread at night, Zhang Shouyi scolded her: "What are you girls doing here in the middle of the night? Get out!" If he doesn't like a female worker, he dismisses her arbitrarily; this is how Chen Guilan was dismissed by him. When female worker Hou Guihua was spinning thread, Zhang Shouyi said, "Don't come next time," and then kicked over her spinning wheel. When a female worker is not careful while working, Zhang Shouyi says, "If this were before, I would have shot you in the head." He put his hand on the female worker's face and gestured a few times, saying, "If it were before, I would have hit you in the face." Zhang Shouyi's actions are completely in the style of a gangster in the old society.

    Editor's Note: The Jixian Public Pinggong Cotton Weaving Factory still uses the old society's ruling class's systems and methods of treating workers to manage the factory. The factory has turned a deaf ear to the national textile union's resolution to abolish the "body search" system. Such shameful things happening in a public factory should attract serious attention from relevant parties. The factory's erroneous behavior is a matter of principle and should be publicly reviewed. The factory's higher-level leading body should immediately conduct an inspection and publish the results in the newspaper.

    Technician Zhang Shouyi's arbitrary beatings, insults, and suppression of workers are erroneous behaviors that represent a loss of the working-class stance and a violation of government policy. He should be given the necessary education or punishment.

To the Editor:

    The Jinan Public Shandong Provincial Construction Company has many serious problems in its business operations and leadership style. For example, there is a great deal of waste in construction and material purchases. The houses the company built for the Shandong Branch of the CPC last year need to be renovated due to poor construction, resulting in a loss of about 400 million yuan. Due to the irresponsibility of the procurement personnel sent out, Qi Chi, 40 percent of the large amount of wood purchased from the Northeast was bad. Some personnel in the company also have serious corruption and embezzlement behavior. For example, Zhang Hekun, the procurement section chief of the materials section, accepted bribes from merchants and secretly stamped the company's official seal. His illegal tax evasion was also discovered by the tax authorities. Zhang Renzheng, a company buyer, lost 80 million yuan buying asphalt felt in Shanghai and engaged in prostitution along the way in Nanjing and Shanghai and accepted bribes from merchants in Jinan. The company's personnel are also very complex. For example, the deputy manager of the Xuzhou branch is an old businessman without political awareness. When the American invading army crossed the 38th parallel in Korea last year, he attempted to pack his bags and run away. The company often violates policies. The company manager, Dai Qihua, publicly proposed at a cadre meeting the slogan "Ensure profit on materials, guarantee costs on projects". Therefore, at the end of last year, the company used a large amount of project funds from the East China Military Region to rush to purchase 50,000 bags of Elephant brand Portland cement in Tianjin, Xuzhou, and other places, and rented warehouses to hoard them. Later, upon hearing of inspections from higher authorities, it divided the cement into smaller units and dispersed them to Zhangdian and Weixian, with transportation costs amounting to 40 million yuan.

    Masses have criticized some of the company's above-mentioned problems in Shandong Dazhong Daily, Tianjin Daily, and Beijing People's Daily last year. However, the company's leading cadres have failed to conduct serious inspections and resolutions. On the contrary, some leading cadres of the company have emphasized objective difficulties everywhere and adopted an attitude of rejection and suppression towards criticism. For example, after Shandong Dazhong Daily published the article "There Are Serious Problems in the Leadership of Shandong Construction Company" written by a company cadre last year, some leading cadres of the company tracked down the writer everywhere, creating pressure on the writer. It was only after the newspaper and the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPC offered their opinions that the investigation was stopped. In January of this year, after the company leadership discovered that secretary Zhu Qing had reported the company's hoarding of Portland cement to the newspaper and the Shandong Provincial Finance and Economics Commission, the leading cadres did not face up to their mistakes but continued to attack and retaliate against the writer. Dai Qihua, the company's manager, lobbied the Personnel Department of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry to transfer Zhu Qing's work. The Department of Industry accepted Dai's request blindly without investigation and transferred Zhu Qing back to the Department of Industry for reassignment without notifying the company. Later, after Shandong Dazhong Daily reported the situation to the Department of Industry, Zhu Qing's job was not transferred.

    Recently, the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry organized an inspection team to inspect the company's work, but it only inspected the general waste phenomena in the company's construction projects and did not delve into the company's leadership style and basic issues related to policy principles. Therefore, the problems that exist in the company cannot be resolved more thoroughly.

    The consistent mistakes of some leading cadres of the company in rejecting and suppressing criticism are inseparable from many incorrect thoughts and styles in their work. We hope that the higher-level leading body of the company can help them earnestly solve these problems.

### 汲县公营平工棉织工厂工人仍受压迫

专栏：读者来信

    汲县公营平工棉织工厂工人仍受压迫编辑同志：
    平原省汲县公营平工棉织工厂，现在仍存在着克扣工人工资、搜身、打骂、污辱工人等严重的封建压迫行为。
    自去年九月间，工人的工资已规定以麦子为标准，但该厂行政上拒不执行，仍以陈小米代替麦子发给工人。当时小麦每斤七百七十元，小米每斤五百元，工人吃亏很大，屡次向行政提出意见，仍未获得解决。行政上提出工厂赔钱，经常想解雇工人，工人职业没有保障。实际上是经营不好，冬天织夏天的袜子销不出去。厂内存一千多万元的货；并经常放着现金，不买原料。劳动保护和工厂卫生根本谈不到。工人赖尚德因修理机子将大拇指压坏，二十多天不能上工，行政上不发给工资和药费。
    工厂内仍存在着封建野蛮污辱工人人格的“搜身制”，行政上雇了一个名叫杜福荣的，专门负责传达勤务和搜身。工人每天下工出厂时，他经常进行搜查，看工人是否偷带了工厂的线。
    该厂技师张守义，仍用压迫手段来对待工人。他经常骂工人“落后”、“不压迫就不行”。一九五○年七月五日，工人沙富民改换了卷布齿轮，提高了质量。但是他不但没有得到表扬，反而受到打击。沙富民本来织白洋布，张守义硬调他织七五被单。沙富民对此技术不熟练，做了十五天工，就少挣三十斤小麦的工资。继之，张守义又调他织颜色花布。这种布不好织易断头。他作了一个多月又少赚六十多斤小麦。后来又故意调他装新织布机，共装了七天，每天只管吃不管工资。沙富民想，不干又没有别的职业，到冬天连棉衣也做不起，只得借了九十斤小麦，才算把夹衣换下来。
    张守义还经常压迫和污辱女工，曾骂女工是妓女；女工一人在工作时，他便动手胡闹。分配工作时，张守义对长得好的女工分配给她好打的线，可以多挣工资；长得不好的女工，就分配给不好打的线。女工牛贵荣因晚上去拿纬管打线，张守义就骂她：女孩子半夜里来干什么，滚回去。看着那个女工不顺眼，他就随便开除，陈桂兰就是这样让他开除的。女工侯桂花在打线时，张守义说：“下次不要来了”，随说就把她的线车踢翻了。那个女工在工作时稍不注意，张守义就说：“在以前你们这样子，我早就用枪从你们头上打过去了。”用手放在女工脸上比量了几下说：“要是以前的时候，我早就向你们脸上打去了。”张守义这些作为，完全是旧社会的流氓作风。
          读者  再扬  莹生
    编者按：汲县公营平工棉织工厂至今仍然沿用旧社会统治阶级对待工人的制度和方法来管理工厂。该厂对于全国纺织工会关于废除“搜身”制度的决议，竟置若罔闻。在公营工厂中竟然发生这样可耻的事情，应引起有关方面的严重注意。该厂的错误行为是原则性的错误，应公开进行检讨。该厂的上级领导机关亦应立即进行检查。并将结果在报纸上公布。
    该厂技师张守义随意打骂、污辱与打击工人，这是丧失工人阶级立场，违犯政府政策的错误行为，应给予必要的教育或处分。
  山东建筑公司经营管理很混乱  压制批评的现象很严重编辑同志：
    济南公营山东省建筑公司在业务经营和领导作风上存在着很多严重的问题。如在施工和材料的购买上浪费很大，去年该公司给中共山东分局盖的房子，因施工不良，须重行翻修，约损失四亿元。因派出的采购人员迟奇对工作不负责，自东北购回的大批木材，有百分之四十是坏的。该公司的某些人员并有严重贪污腐化行为，如材料课采购股长张和坤接受商人贿赂，偷盖公司公章，其违法漏税行为并为税务机关查出。该公司采购员张仁政去上海买油毛毡，赔损八千万元，并沿途在南京、上海嫖妓，在济南接受商人贿赂。该公司人员亦很复杂，如徐州分公司副经理是一个没有政治认识的旧商人，去年美国侵略军在朝鲜越过三八线时，他曾企图卷起行李逃跑。该公司常常违犯政策，公司经理戴启华曾在干部会上公开提出“工程保本，材料赚钱”的口号，故在去年年底，该公司曾利用华东军区的大批工程款，到天津、徐州等地抢购马牌洋灰五万袋，租用仓库，囤积起来。后来，听说上级检查，即化整为零，分别疏散到张店、潍县，运费用了四千万元。
    对上述该公司的某些问题，去年在山东大众日报、天津日报、北京人民日报上都曾发表过群众的批评。但该公司的领导干部一直未能认真进行检查和解决，相反的，该公司某些领导干部却处处强调客观困难，对批评采取拒绝和压制的态度。如去年山东大众日报发表该公司干部所写《山东建筑公司领导上存在严重问题》一稿后，公司某些领导干部即到处追查写稿人，对写稿人形成压力，后经报社和中共山东省委提出意见后，才停止追查。今年一月，该公司领导上发现秘书竹青将公司囤积洋灰的事件反映给报社及山东省财政经济委员会，领导干部不正视自己的错误，仍继续向写稿人进行打击、报复，该公司戴启华经理并向山东省工业厅人事处活动，调动竹青的工作。工业厅亦竟不加调查，盲目接受戴的要求，不通知给该公司，调竹青回工业厅另行分配工作。后经山东大众日报社向工业厅反映其中情形，竹青的工作始未调动。
    最近山东省工业厅曾组织一检查组，赴该公司检查工作，但只是就该公司施工工程中的一般浪费现象进行检查，尚未深入到该公司的领导作风及有关政策原则性的基本问题进行检查。因此，对该公司所存在的问题就不能加以比较彻底的解决。
    该公司某些领导干部一贯拒绝和压制批评的错误，是和他们工作中很多不正确的思想和作风分不开的，我们希望该公司的上级领导机关能帮助他们认真地解决这些问题。
