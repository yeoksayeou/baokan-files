　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works Ore Dressing Plant Workshop
    Propagandists Serve Production
    Wang Qing
    When you talk to Li Zhigang, the secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Ore Dressing Plant workshop branch of the Chinese Communist Party, about the work of the branch, he will tell you: "In the past, the branch did not guarantee the completion of production tasks, but only shouted empty slogans of leading production. Party members only buried themselves in hard work and did not use other methods to promote production. At the same time, the relationship between the Party and the masses was not close. Now we have a solution. As long as the branch takes action, everyone (including non-Party masses) will follow. This is mainly because the branch has established propagandists and carried out propaganda work."
    The ore dressing plant workshop has eleven propagandists, led by Li Zhigang, the branch secretary. The characteristic of the branch's leadership of the propagandists is that it frequently determines the propaganda content and methods for each period based on the general branch's instructions on propaganda work, the problems existing in the workshop's production, and the ideological situation of the workers. Before September of last year, the main problem in the production of the ore dressing plant workshop was: "Maintain safe operation and eliminate machine and personnel accidents." The branch concentrated the entire propaganda and mobilization force on this issue. Some workers believed that "the machines are old and accidents cannot be eliminated," so the propagandists used various typical facts to illustrate that machine and personnel accidents can be eliminated; and educated the workers to strengthen the overall concept and jointly overcome the difficulties in production. By the end of September, these problems had been resolved.
    The problem of safe production was solved, but the production task for September was still not completed, and both the production quantity and quality were low. In October, the branch led the propagandists to focus on publicizing "struggle to increase production and improve quality." The branch also conducted specific research on this issue and found that to increase production quantity and quality, it was necessary to improve the particle size of the crusher and correct the conservative ideas of the workers who thought, "Even the Japanese devils in the puppet Manchukuo era could not improve it, so we cannot improve it." The branch then appointed He Guozhao (technician), a highly respected propagandist, and several other propagandists to publicize and take the lead in studying methods to improve the particle size of the crusher. Other propagandists cooperated with the squad leaders and team leaders to mobilize the workers to make individual and team production plans to ensure the completion of their own production tasks. Later, He Guozhao's research on improving the particle size of the crusher was successful. This not only increased the production volume but also slightly improved the quality, ensuring that the production task for October was completed four days ahead of schedule. By November, the production quality still did not meet the standards required by the higher authorities. The propagandists then researched and found that the key to improving production quality lies in the magnetic separator. First, because several workers on the magnetic separator did not have high enough political awareness and their sense of responsibility was not strong enough, they could not complete the requirements of the higher authorities. In addition, two workers had poor skills and could not properly maintain the roller skin, adjust the current and water gate, and find the right amount of ore, which also affected production quality. At this time, the branch determined that the propagandists should help these workers improve from the above aspects and put forward the slogan of "Protect the roller skin, adjust frequently, tail twelve, fine sixty." Soon, the production quality improved to the standards required by the higher authorities.
    In production, propagandists can also discover problems at any time and report them to the branch as the content of the branch's propaganda work. In the past, the ore dressing plant wasted a lot of grease. After propagandist Wang Dongsheng discovered this, he immediately made a suggestion to the branch to save grease. Then, he personally experimented for two days, and as a result, he could save four gallons of oil per day, which could save the country 100 million Northeast currency per month.

　　鞍山钢厂选矿场车间
    宣传员为生产服务
    王清
    当你和中共鞍山钢厂选矿工场车间支部书记李志刚谈起支部工作时，他就会告诉你：“从前支部没有保证完成生产任务，只是空喊领导生产，党员也只是自己埋头苦干，再不会用其他方法来推动生产，同时党和群众的关系也不密切。现在可有了办法，有啥事只要支部一动，大家（连非党群众在内）就跟着动起来了。这主要是因为支部设立了宣传员，进行了宣传工作。”
    选矿场车间共有宣传员十一名，由支部书记李志刚亲自领导。支部领导宣传员的特点，是经常根据总支对于宣传工作的指示、车间生产中存在的问题及职工思想情况，确定各个时期的宣传内容和方法。在去年九月份以前，选矿工厂车间生产中的主要问题是：“保持安全运转，消灭机器和人员事故。”支部就把整个宣传鼓动工作的力量，集中在这一问题上。有些工人认为“机器旧，无法消灭事故”，宣传员便利用各种典型事实，说明机器和人员的事故是可以消灭的；并教育工人加强整体观念，共同来克服生产中的困难。九月末，这些问题已得到解决。
    安全生产的问题解决了，但九月份的生产任务还是没有完成，无论是生产数量或生产质量都低。十月份支部又领导宣传员集中宣传“为提高生产的产量和质量而斗争”。支部并对这一问题作了具体研究，发现了要提高生产产量和质量，必须改进破碎机的粒度，并纠正工友们的“伪满时代日本鬼子都没法改进，我们是改进不了的”的保守观念。支部就指定威信较高的宣传员何国钊（技术员）和另外几个宣传员一面宣传，一面以身作则地研究改进破碎机粒度的方法。其他宣传员则配合着班长、组长发动职工订个人与班组生产计划，以保证完成自己的生产任务。后来何国钊改进破碎机粒度的研究成功了。这样不仅提高了生产量；而且质量也稍有提高。保证了十月份的生产任务提前四天完成。到十一月份，生产质量还是达不到上级要求的标准。宣传员又研究出提高生产质量的关键在于磁选机。这，首先是因为磁选机的几个工友政治觉悟不够高，工作责任心不强，因而不能完成上级的要求。另外还有两个工友技术还差，不能很好保滚皮调整电流和水门，找不准矿量，也影响了生产质量。这时支部就确定宣传员要从以上几方面去帮助这几位工友进步，并提出了“保滚皮，勤调整，尾十二，精六○”的口号。不久，生产质量就提高到上级所要求的标准。
    宣传员在生产中，还能够随时发现问题，向支部汇报，作为支部宣传工作的内容。选矿场过去油脂浪费很大，宣传员王东升发现后，当即向支部提出节省油脂的建议，随后他自己又亲自试验了两天，结果每日可省油四加仑，一月就能给国家节省东北币一亿元。
