Overview of Commodity Prices and Finance in February
      Yang Fangxun

    In February, commodity prices maintained a stable state, with specific measures taken to stabilize prices before the Spring Festival and to eliminate the "red plate" (referring to price hikes) after the holiday. According to the commodity price index of six major cities compiled by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the end of February saw an increase of only 1.5% compared to the end of January.

    The stability of commodity prices after the Spring Festival was mainly due to the active preparation of large quantities of materials by state-owned trading companies to supply the market. At the same time, they earnestly ensured that wholesale prices remained completely the same before and after the Spring Festival. In addition, the increased political awareness of private industrial and commercial operators, under the leadership and organization of local governments, led them to propose guarantees against price increases. This also played a role in stabilizing prices.

    In order to stabilize prices and invigorate the economy, it is necessary to vigorously organize the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This is an arduous task, and relying solely on the strength of state-owned trade and cooperatives is not enough. It is necessary to organize private businesses to work together. To solve the problems of private merchants, such as "lack of capital, limited reach, and blind operation," organizing joint operations is a good solution. Tianjin held a native products meeting, and within this month, industries such as grain, oilseeds, and dried and fresh mountain goods organized purchasing and sales committees. Their main tasks were to launch and organize joint operations by relevant units, as well as to design joint operation organizational forms and purchasing and sales plans.

    With stable commodity prices and vigorous development of urban-rural material exchanges, the deposit, loan, and remittance businesses of public and private financial institutions are showing a trend of increase. For example, the deposits of private banks and financial houses in seven major cities increased by 7.8% at the end of February compared with the end of January, and loans increased by 8.2%.

    State-owned banks and private banks and financial houses are working hard to implement the policy of developing production and supporting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in their business operations. This is mainly reflected in: state-owned banks providing large amounts of funds to support public and private trade, and implementing preferential loans for joint commercial organizations. In order to promote planned material exchange, the People's Bank of Tianjin recently stipulated that joint operation organizations approved by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce can enjoy appropriate interest rate reductions, relaxed collateral discounts, and extended repayment periods after sight drafts are honored in terms of loans. The Tianjin Public-Private Banking Syndicate held a meeting on February 20 and approved that the focus of this year's spring loans is to support the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, so that the syndicate's tens of billions of funds can fully contribute to: helping industrial products go to the countryside; assisting manufacturers in purchasing raw materials and native products; and continuing to support import and export trade. Regulations have also been made on the industries to which loans should be made, the methods of lending, and preferential measures for joint industrial and commercial organizations.

    2. Public and private banks sign business contracts with industrial and commercial enterprises. In order to support the development of private industry and commerce and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Zhengzhou People's Bank signed deposit, loan, and remittance business contracts with Minfeng Paper Mill, Yishengxiang, Guangtaixiang, Yuanchang Hardware Store, Nanyang Department Store, and Hengfeng Flour Mill in December last year. The basic spirit of the contract is mutual benefit and willingness. The main contents are: the contracted households guarantee that all daily business income, except for a small amount for petty expenses, will be deposited into the People's Bank, and the transfer of funds between ports will be remitted through the People's Bank; the People's Bank guarantees that the contracted households have complete freedom to withdraw deposits without any restrictions, and deposits can also be withdrawn outside of business hours. Convenience and priority are also given in other loan, deposit, and remittance procedures. After the business contract was signed, on the one hand, the private enterprises' capital turnover was flexible, and the withdrawal of deposits was convenient. For example, Shouchun White Rice Store in the city urgently needed 6 million yuan in cash on December 16, which happened to be a Sunday, but because the rice store had a business contract with the bank, it quickly withdrew the money from the bank. At the same time, this method also increased the deposits of the state-owned bank. This is of great benefit to both parties. Recently, more than 100 industrial and commercial households have signed business contracts with the Zhengzhou People's Bank. Signing business contracts is a better way for state-owned banks to develop private business and is worth promoting.

    The Tianjin branches of Jin Cheng, Zhongnan, Dalu, Yanye, and Lianhe Banks signed a business contact contract with Beiyang Yarn Factory on February 1. The contract stipulates that the yarn factory shall prepare a monthly financial revenue and expenditure plan and a loan repayment plan in accordance with the actual production and sales situation, and after the bank approves it, it shall lend to the yarn factory within the prescribed limits according to the plan for short-term production capital turnover. At the same time, all deposits, loans, remittances, and other receipts and payments of the yarn factory in its business, except for the state-owned bank, shall be handled by the five banks. The role of the business contact contract is to further enable the financial industry to support production in a planned way, and at the same time, promote private enterprises to gradually move towards planned operation. This method is also worth promoting.

　　二月份物价金融概述
      杨方勋
    二月份的物价，在春节前物价稳定和节后消除“红盘”恶例的具体情况下，始终呈现平稳状态。据中央人民政府贸易部所编六大城市物价指数来看，二月底与一月底比较，仅升百分之一点五。
    春节后的物价稳定，主要由于国营贸易公司积极准备大量物资供应市场，同时认真做到春节前后批发牌价完全相同；另外私营工商业者政治觉悟提高，在各地政府的领导与组织下，纷纷提出不涨价的保证。这对稳定物价也有一定的作用。
    为了稳定物价，活跃经济，必须大力组织城乡物资交流，这是一项艰巨的任务，只靠国营贸易和合作社的力量是不够的，必须组织私营商业共同来努力。为了解决私商“资金少，腿短，经营盲目”等问题，组织联营是一个好办法。天津市召开土产会议，本月内先后有粮食、油脂油料、山干鲜货等行业组织购销委员会，其任务主要是：发动与组织有关单位之联合经营，以及设计联营组织方式，购销计划等。
    在物价稳定，大力开展城乡物资交流的情况下，公私金融业的存款、放款、汇兑等业务都呈现着增加的趋势。如七大城市私营行庄的存款，二月底与一月底比较增加百分之七点八，放款增加百分之八点二。
    国家银行与私营行庄在业务经营方面，都在努力实现发展生产扶助城乡物资交流的方针。主要表现在：国家银行除拿出大批资金扶助公私贸易外，并对联营的商业组织实行贷款优待。天津市人民银行为了促进有计划的物资交流，最近规定凡经工商局核准的联营组织，在贷款方面，可享受适当降低利率，放宽抵押品折扣，押汇见票后，还款期限的延长等。该市公私营银行业联合银团于二月二十日开会通过本年春季贷款的重点是扶助城乡内外物资交流。使银团的数百亿资金充分作到：帮助工业品下乡；协助厂商采购原料和土产；继续扶助进出口贸易。对应贷款的行业，放款方式和对工商业的联营组织优待办法等均作了规定。
    二、公私银行与工商业订立业务合同。郑州市人民银行为了扶助私营工商业发展与促进城乡物资交流，曾于去年十二月与民丰造纸厂、义盛祥、广泰祥、元昌五金号、南洋百货店、恒丰面粉厂等订立存款、放款、汇兑业务合同。合同的基本精神是两利两愿，主要内容是：合同户保证每日营业全部收入除留少数作零星开支外，悉数存入人民银行，埠际间款项调拨通过人民银行汇兑；人民银行则保证合同户提取存款完全自由，不受任何限制，在非营业时间也可提取存款，其他贷款、存款、汇兑等手续方面也都给以便利和优先权。订立业务合同后，一方面使私营企业资金周转灵活，提取存款便利，如该市寿丰白米店，十二月十六日急需现款六百万元，这一天恰好是星期天，但因该米店与银行订有业务合同，所以到银行很快就把款取了出来。同时这个办法使国家银行也增加了存款。这对双方都有很大好处。最近已有一百多户工商业与郑州人民银行订立业务合同。订立业务合同已是国家银行开展私人业务的较好方式，是值得推广的。
    天津市金城、中南、大陆、盐业、联合等五银行与北洋纱厂于二月一日签订业务联系合同。合同规定：由纱厂每月按照实际产销情况，编制下月份财务收支计划，借款还款计划，经银行审核同意后，即依照计划在规定限度内，对纱厂贷款，作为短期生产资金周转之用。同时，纱厂在业务上一切存、放、汇等收付款项，除国家银行外，统由该五行办理。业务联系合同的作用，既可进一步使金融业有计划地扶助生产，同时又可促使私营企业、逐渐走向计划经营。这种方式也是值得提倡的。
