With Spies Around, We Can Never Have a Good Life
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zheng Zhongguang

I am a businessman, and because I have suffered at the hands of spy lackeys, I get furious whenever spies are mentioned. Recently, I read in the newspaper that Tianjin and Beijing executed dozens of heinous spies, bandits, and despots. Although the spies who harmed me were not among those executed, I was still extremely pleased. I know that all spies are our enemies, especially those heinous spy bandits who killed countless Chinese people during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. After liberation, they continued to do evil and oppose the people. These unrepentant spies deserve to be killed; otherwise, our people will never have a good life.

I have been doing business in Tianjin for over twenty years, dealing in Western medicine and hardware. During these twenty-odd years, I have suffered the arrogance of Japanese and Kuomintang spies.

During the period of enemy and puppet rule, I opened a small Western pharmacy. At that time, doing business required constant vigilance. Whenever a customer came to buy medicine, if they seemed suspicious or were looking for trouble, I would not only dare not ask for money but would also have to serve them respectfully with a smiling face. One day, I had just gone to the backyard to prepare medicine when I heard a commotion at the front counter. I rushed over and saw that a new clerk was arguing fiercely with a customer. The customer saw me and immediately came at me aggressively, starting with the insult "ba ga ya lu" (a Japanese phrase), cursing in Japanese even though he was clearly Chinese. I knew something was amiss, so I apologized without even asking what the argument was about. He cursed at me half in Chinese and half in Japanese for a long time, and I finally understood that it was because the clerk had refused to give him credit. "What credit? He was clearly trying to take the medicine without paying!" I thought to myself, but I didn't dare say it out loud. To get rid of him quickly, I held out the medicine bottle to him, inviting him to take it. Who knew that this guy would slap the bottle out of my hand, smashing it on the ground, and then kick me to the ground. Before I could get up, he turned around and swaggered out the door. I had been beaten and cursed, the medicine bottle was broken, and I was full of pent-up anger. After he left, I didn't even dare to complain, thinking to myself, "Don't cause any more trouble." Sure enough, something happened within a week. That morning, just after opening the shop, two Japanese soldiers came in and asked for the owner. I couldn't hide in time, so I bravely asked them what they wanted. Without letting me speak, they dragged me away. At the Japanese military police station, during the interrogation, I found out that the person interrogating me was the same guy who had tried to buy medicine without paying. They said I was secretly communicating with the Eighth Route Army and insisted that I confess. This inexplicable accusation left me speechless. How could I confess to something I didn't do? Fine! If I wouldn't confess, the Japanese devils and that lackey immediately started to abuse me like vicious dogs. They tortured me with leg presses and poured cold water over me, nearly killing me. The first day, they couldn't get anything out of me. The second day, the same thing. For three days in a row. On the third night, after the last round of torture, they said my heart was bad and told me to go home and reflect carefully, and that I was no longer allowed to do business in Western medicine. After being released, I went home in a daze. When I got home, I found out that the day after I was arrested, that Chinese lackey had used a Japanese truck to "confiscate" all the medicine in the shop! I was both angry and anxious, and the serious injuries nearly killed me. It took me more than half a year to recover.

I held this injustice in my heart, and finally Japan surrendered. After the Kuomintang came, I scraped together some money and opened a small hardware store. Because I had suffered enough from the Japanese devils, I initially saw the Kuomintang as saviors. But as time went on, I gradually realized that something was wrong. How could it be? The spy lackeys from the Japanese era had become Kuomintang officials! How could there be people in the Kuomintang who had been lackeys for the Japanese? This question puzzled me. Just from what I knew, several officials in the Inspection Office were spies from the Japanese era! Later, someone told me that they were doing underground work for the Kuomintang. I was even more confused. Why would people doing underground work for the Kuomintang treat the Japanese as their ancestors and harm the Chinese people? I finally understood the answer to this question.

In the third year after the Kuomintang came, one winter night, a relative came to visit me from my hometown in Jinghai County and stayed at my house. In the middle of the night, while everyone was asleep, without even hearing a knock on the door, four or five plainclothes officers suddenly broke into my house. When I woke up, my relative had already been tied up. These plainclothes officers, carrying guns, searched the house. At first, I thought they were bandits. After searching, they told me they were from the Inspection Office. They asked if I was hiding any Eighth Route Army soldiers. Without letting me understand what was going on, they tied me up too and told me to go to the Inspection Office for questioning. I thought to myself, "I haven't done anything wrong, so they won't be as unreasonable as the Japanese devils!"

When I got to the Inspection Office, I found out that they were even more unreasonable than the Japanese devils, insisting that I was an Eighth Route Army worker and demanding that I confess who the communists were. Strangely, I ran into that Chinese lackey who had tortured me at the Japanese military police station a few years earlier. He was still as arrogant as before, still asking me the same questions, just not cursing me in Japanese. It was truly a case of enemies meeting, eyes blazing with hatred. Running into this enemy again, I didn't care about life or death anymore and started to curse him. I thought, "The Kuomintang reactionaries and the traitorous lackeys are all one family. Now that I've fallen into the hands of these beasts again, I can forget about getting out of here alive!" That night, the spies pressed me to the ground and kicked my head and chest with their heavy leather boots. My head felt as heavy as if it had been hit with a hammer, and I fainted again and again. The next day, they questioned me again at night, and if they couldn't get anything out of me, they would torture me again. Afterwards, maybe every two days, maybe every three days, they tortured me until I was barely alive. Seeing that I was about to die, they realized that it wouldn't be worth it if they didn't get something out of me, so they told my family to pay a large sum of money to redeem me.

Although I was lucky enough not to die in these two encounters, I was left with a limp and a blind eye. I was just one person who suffered such abuse from the bandits, and my case was relatively mild. The suffering endured by the Chinese people under the oppression and slaughter of spies and bandits was even more indescribable. From what I know, some parents lost their sons, some wives lost their husbands, and some people were extorted by spies and left penniless. The harm to the country and the nation was even greater. Today, although the Kuomintang rule has been overthrown, they are not reconciled and are trying to exploit every opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. For example, spies in Lingling County, Hunan, set a fire that destroyed 512 houses.

Spies and bandits are so hateful that as long as they exist, the common people will never have a good life. Just from the suffering I have endured and the things I know, it is already intolerable. After liberation, I was most concerned about how the government would deal with these spy lackeys. Initially, I was a little disappointed because at that time, the government seemed too lenient towards spies and bandits. Many major spies were arrested, but there were no results, and some were released after being detained for only a short time. I thought, "Are spies being treated like petty thieves?!" If spies are arrested but not strictly punished, the spies will be happy, but the people can't stand it! Fortunately, the government later realized this excessive leniency and corrected it in time, executing those who should be executed, imprisoning those who should be imprisoned, and controlling those who should be controlled. On January 26th of this year, Tianjin executed 38 heinous spies and bandits in one batch. Only then did I truly admire our government. Especially recently, the government announced the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," which I read carefully, article by article. With concrete regulations in place, and with the continuous execution of dozens of major spies and despots, I was finally able to vent the pent-up anger in my heart. I became bolder and felt that the People's Government had truly brought me warmth and a guarantee of safety.

　　有特务就永远过不了好日子
    郑中光
    我是一个商人，因为我受过特务狗腿子的害，所以一提起特务来心里就冒火。最近，我从报纸上看到天津市和北京市枪毙了好几十个罪大恶极的特务、土匪和恶霸，虽然枪毙的这些匪徒里，没有害过我的那个特务，我也痛快极了。我知道，只要是特务，就是我们的仇敌，尤其是那些罪大恶极的特务匪徒，在日寇和国民党统治的时候，他们杀害了数不清的中国人民。解放以后，他们还为非做歹，跟人民作对。这些不知道悔改的特务，都是该杀该枪毙的；要不然，咱们人民永远也没有好日子过。
    我在天津市做了有二十多年的买卖，西药业也干过，五金业也干过，就在这二十几年当中，日本特务和国民党特务的气，我都受过。
    在敌伪统治时，我开了一个小西药房。那时候做买卖，处处得留神，遇上客人来买药，只要一觉得来的人有点邪气，要来找岔儿，卖了不但不敢要钱，还得满脸陪笑恭恭敬敬地把他奉承走了。有一天，我刚上后院去打药包，就听见前边柜上吵起来了，赶紧跑过去一看，原来是柜上一个新来的伙计，跟一个买主正吵得脸红脖子粗的。那个买主看我去了，马上气势汹汹地就朝我来了，开头一句就骂我“八个鸭路”，明明是中国人，偏偏拿日本话骂人，我知道有点来头不对，也没问吵架的原因是什么，赶紧就道歉。他一半中国话一半日本话地把我骂了半天，才知道是因为伙计没答应赊账。“什么赊账呀？明明是硬拿药不给钱！”我心里这么想，可没敢说出来。为了快点把他打发走，我捧着药瓶子，送到他的跟前，请他拿走，谁知道，这小子一巴掌把药瓶子就给打碎在地上了，接着就是一脚，把我踹倒，没等我爬起来，他就转身大模大样地开门走了。打骂都挨了，药瓶子也碎了，受了一肚子窝囊气。他走了以后，我连气儿都不敢吭，心里还直嘀咕，别再惹出祸来，果然，没出一个礼拜，出事啦。那天早晨刚下板，来了两个日本宪兵，进门就找掌柜的，我躲也来不及了，大着胆子问他们有什么事，也不容我说话，连推带拉地就带走了。到了日本宪兵队，过堂问话时，原来审我的就有那天买药不给钱的那小子。他们说我私通八路，硬叫我招出来。这莫明其妙的事情，叫我从哪儿招起呀！好！不招！日本鬼子跟那个狗腿子，立刻像恶狗似地收拾起我来了，一阵压杠子，一阵灌凉水，收拾得我死去活来。头一天，什么也没问出来，第二天，照样来。连着三天，第三天晚上，最末一次收拾完了，他们说，我的心坏了，叫我回家去好好反省反省，西药买卖不准我做了。放了以后，迷迷糊糊地回家，到家才知道，抓我去的第二天，那个中国狗腿子就用日本大卡车，把铺子里的药品全部“没收”拉走了！我又是生气，又是着急，再加上身上的重伤，差点没要了命。在家足足躺了半年多，这条命才算保住了。
    这口冤气蹩在心里，好容易日本投降了。国民党来了以后，我东凑西借的，又开了一个小五金行。因为我受够了日本鬼子的气，最初，对国民党真看得像天神一样。哪知道，日子长了，慢慢发觉越来越不对头。怎么？日本那会儿的特务狗腿子又当了国民党的官儿啦？国民党里怎么也有给日本当过狗腿子的？这个疑问可把我绕住了。光是我知道的，稽查处里就有好几个官儿是日本那会儿的特务！后来，别人告诉我，说那是给国民党作地下工作的。我更糊涂了，给国民党作地下工作的，为什么拿日本当祖宗专害咱们中国人民呢？这个疑问，最后我明白了。
    国民党来了的第三年，在一个冬天的晚上，有个亲戚从静海县老家来看我，住在我家。就在那天的后半夜，人都睡着了，也没听见叫门，突然有四五个便衣闯进我的屋里，等我醒了时，那个亲戚已被绑上了。这几个便衣凶狠狠地提着枪，满屋里一顿乱搜。起先，我还以为是土匪，搜完了，他们告诉我说是稽查处的。他们问我还藏着八路没有。这个没头没脑的事，也没等我弄清楚，就把我也捆上了，叫我到稽查处去问话。我还想，反正我什么事也没有，他们决不会像日本鬼子那么不讲理吧！
    到了稽查处，谁知道他们比日本鬼子还他妈的不讲理，硬说我是八路工作人员，非叫我招出来谁是共产党不可。最奇怪的，前几年在日本宪兵队收拾过我的那个中国狗腿子，又碰上了。他还是那个神气，还是那么问我，就是没拿日本话骂我。真是仇人见面分外眼红，又碰上这个仇人，我就再也顾不得死活，破口大骂起来。我想，国民党反动派与汉奸狗腿子是一家子，这回又落在这群畜类手里，要好好出来就别打算！就是那天晚上，特务们把我按在地上，用大皮靴狠狠地踢我的脑袋，踹我的胸口，我的脑袋好像撞在铁锤上那么沉重，一次一次地昏死过去。第二天，还是在夜里问我，问不出来再收拾。以后，也许两天一次，也许三天一次，弄得我只剩下一口气了。他们眼看人要完了，觉得不捞点什么不合算，这才叫我家里花了一大笔钱把我赎出去了。
    这两次遭遇，虽然侥幸没死，但是一条腿瘸了，还瞎了一只眼。光我就受了匪徒们这样的蹂躏，像我还算比较轻的，除我以外，中国人民在特务匪徒的压迫屠杀之下，所尝受的痛苦就更无法形容了。据我知道的，有些父母死了儿子，有些妻子失掉了丈夫，也有人被特务敲诈得倾家荡产，至于对国家民族的危害就更大了。今天，国民党的统治虽然被打垮了，但是他们还不会甘心，他们要在各方面钻空子进行破坏活动。比如湖南零陵县的特务放火，一下烧毁了房屋五百十二栋。
    特务匪徒们这么可恨，有他们存在，老百姓永远过不了好日子，仅仅从我所受的痛苦和我知道的一些事情，就已经叫人无法容忍了。解放以后，我最关心的，就是想知道政府怎么对付这些特务狗腿子们。最初，我感到有点失望，因为那时候，政府对特务匪徒们好像太客气了，许多大特务关起来了，但没结果，也有的关了没多久又放出来了被我想，对待特务是不是也像对待小偷一样呢？！特务被逮住了，也不严格处置一下，这要是长了，特务们倒是高兴了，老百姓可真受不了！幸亏后来政府发觉了这个宽大无边的偏向，及时纠正，该杀的杀，该关的关，该管的管，天津市今年一月二十六日，一批就枪毙了三十八个罪大恶极的特务匪徒。这么一来，我才真佩服我们的政府了。尤其最近，政府又公布了“惩治反革命条例”，我逐条仔细阅读了。有了具体规定，并且又接连枪毙了好几十个大特务、大恶霸。我看到了这些，心里的闷气才吐了出来，胆子也壮了，感到人民政府真给我带来了温暖，也给我带来了安全的保障。
