Cooperatives in North China
Universally Implement the Contract System
Forming a Cooperative Commercial Network to Expand Sales Channels for Local Products

　　Cooperatives in North China have universally implemented the contract system, thus promoting the sale of a large amount of agricultural products, and playing a significant role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. For example, the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province sold local products after last autumn, accounting for 27 percent of the total local product exchange in the district. The Cooperatives General Office of Chahar Province, last year, cooperated with state-owned trading organizations to purchase and sell surplus grain, accounting for 60 percent of the province's total grain sold outside the province. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office sold a large amount of cotton and local products last year, of which the sales of hides and saltpeter accounted for 66 percent of the province's annual output of hides and saltpeter. In the first half of last year, the office supplied grain to its members, equivalent to 30 percent of the province's total grain shortage, helping to solve the grain supply problem for people in cotton-producing areas and disaster areas.

　　According to statistics, in the five months from January to May last year, cooperatives at all levels in North China signed more than 20,000 purchase and sale contracts. Among them, the business operations of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shanxi Province through contracts have accounted for one-third of the entire business. There are many types and forms of contracts signed between cooperatives in various places, among which the main ones are agency purchase and sale and chain business contracts between cooperatives and state-owned trading companies, joint operation contracts between upper and lower-level cooperatives or between cooperatives at the same level, and pre-purchase, credit purchase, and supply and marketing contracts between cooperatives and members. The signing of these contracts has formed a vertical cooperative commercial network between urban and rural areas, enabling state-owned trading companies to systematically purchase various agricultural products and promote industrial products to the countryside through them; farmers can also sell agricultural and sideline products at reasonable prices in exchange for industrial products. At the same time, the signing of these contracts has also formed a horizontal cooperative commercial network between regions, expanding the domestic sales market for local products. For example, in order to organize the exchange of materials between mountainous areas and plains, and between irrigated and dry land areas in more than 200 villages in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, last winter, the county cooperative led the supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts and villages to sign 239 contracts, selling 201,943 catties of peach kernels in three months, about 38 percent of the annual output; and 29,300 catties of Chinese prickly ash, about 47 percent of the annual output. The combination of the aforementioned contracts has formed a crisscrossing cooperative commercial network. In this way, the sales channels for local products have been greatly expanded.

### 华北各地合作社  普遍推行合同制  构成合作商业网扩大土产销路

　　华北各地合作社
    普遍推行合同制
    构成合作商业网扩大土产销路
    华北各地合作社普遍推行合同制，因而推销了大量农产品，在城乡物资交流中起了很大的作用。如平原省安阳专区各级供销社合作社在去年秋后销售的土产，即占全区土产交流总量的百分之二十七；察哈尔省合作总社去年全年配合国营贸易机构收购和推销的余粮占全省外销粮食总数的百分之六十。河北省合作总社去年销出大量棉花和土产，其中推销的皮硝占全省皮硝年产量的百分之六十六；该社去年上半年供给社员的粮食，等于全省缺粮总数的百分之三十，帮助解决了棉产区和灾区人民的粮食供应问题。
    据统计：去年一月到五月的五个月内，华北全区各级合作社共订立购销合同两万多件，其中山西省各级供销合作社通过合同经营的业务已占整个业务的三分之一。各地合作社间所订合同的性质和形式很多；其中最主要的几种是合作社与各国营贸易公司间的代购代销和连环业务合同，上、下级合作社间或同级合作社间的联营合同，和合作社与社员间的预购、赊购、供销合同。这些合同的订立构成了城、乡间的纵的合作商业网，使得国营贸易公司可以通过它们有计划地收购各种农产品和推销工业品下乡；农民也可按合理价格出售农、副产品，换取工业品。同时，这些合同的订立也构成了地区间的横的合作商业网，扩大了土产的内销市场。如平原省林县县社去年冬季为组织该县山地和平原、水地与旱地间二百多村的物资交换，领导各区、各村供销合作社订立了合同二百三十九件，在三个月内推销了桃仁二十万一千九百四十三斤，约等于年产量的百分之三十八；花椒二万九千三百斤，约等于年产量的百分之四十七。前述各种合同结合起来，形成了纵横交错的合作商业网。这样，便大大扩大了土产品的销路。                          （新华社）
