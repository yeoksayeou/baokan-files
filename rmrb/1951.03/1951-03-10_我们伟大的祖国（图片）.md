    Our Great Motherland
    The oldest existing astronomical observatory in our country is the "Star Observation Platform" in Gaocheng Town (ancient name Yangcheng), Dengfeng County, Henan Province. It can measure the North Pole. In front of the platform is a "measuring scale," which is 30.17 meters long and can determine the total length of the solar year in days. These were all built more than 600 years ago by Guo Shoujing, a great scientist of the Yuan Dynasty in our country, based on the experience of the Zhou, Han, and Tang dynasties.

    我们伟大的祖国
    我国现存最古的天文台是河南登封县告成镇（古称阳城）的“观星台”。它可以测北极。台前为“量天尺”，长三○·一七公尺，可以测定太阳年全长为若干时日。这些都是六百余年前我国元代大科学家郭守敬，根据周代和汉唐各代的经验所建置的。
