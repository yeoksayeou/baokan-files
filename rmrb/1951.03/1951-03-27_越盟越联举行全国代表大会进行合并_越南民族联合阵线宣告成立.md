Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, March 22nd Dispatch: The National Congress convened to merge the two national united fronts of Vietnam—the Viet Minh (Vietnam Independence League) and the Viet Lien (Vietnam National Union)—was held in the first half of March. The congress was presided over by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the founder of both the Viet Minh and Viet Lien. Representatives from the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Vietnam Revolutionary League attended the meeting, as did representatives from various Vietnamese people's organizations, workers, peasants, social notables, national capitalists, enlightened landlords, representatives of people from French-occupied areas, and overseas Vietnamese representatives. Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao National United Front, and Xiu Xing, a representative of the Central Committee of the Cambodian National United Front, attended as observers. In addition to a large portrait of Chairman Ho Chi Minh hanging in the venue, there were also large portraits of Stalin, Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung, and Thorez.

Father Phạm Bá Trực delivered the opening speech on behalf of the Central Committee of Viet Lien and the guiding committee of Viet Minh. He emphasized that the purpose of merging Viet Minh and Viet Lien was to further advance the Vietnamese people's war of liberation and national construction.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh spoke at the congress. He expressed his pleasure at the success of the Vietnamese national united front policy. He said: In the future, not only the Vietnamese people, but also the people of Laos and Cambodia will be broadly united. The broad and single-minded unity of the people of these three countries will surely defeat the French imperialists and the American interventionists. Chairman Ho Chi Minh instructed the congress: All parties, groups, and people of all ethnicities must unite closely within the united front, sincerely help and learn from each other, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and make progress together.

The congress drafted a twelve-point program aimed at completing national liberation, consolidating and developing the people's democratic regime, and carrying out national construction.

The congress resolved that the Vietnam National United Front after the merger of Viet Minh and Viet Lien would be called the "Vietnam National United Front" or simply "Viet Lien Front," and unanimously elected Ho Chi Minh as honorary chairman.

The congress elected a National Committee of the Viet Lien Front consisting of 54 representatives, with Tôn Đức Thắng as chairman and Lê Thị Xuyến, Lê Văn Châm, Cao Triều Phát, Hoàng Quốc Việt, Dương Đức Hiền, and Hoàng Minh Giám as vice-chairmen.

The National Committee of the Viet Lien Front elected a Standing Committee, which included seventeen members: Trường Chinh, General Secretary of the Labor Party; Trần Danh Tuyên, General Secretary of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor; Hồ Viết Thắng, General Secretary of the Farmers' National Salvation Association; Hoàng Minh Chính, General Secretary of the Vietnam Youth Federation; and Xuân Thủy, Chairman of the Vietnam Journalists Association, among others.

The congress also held a special meeting to hear the Vietnam Peace Committee read out the resolutions of the Warsaw World Peace Congress and the Berlin World Peace Council. The delegates signed the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

Tôn Quang Phiệt, a member of the Standing Committee of the Vietnam National Assembly, summarized the achievements of the congress at the closing session, saying: From now on, there will be only one national united front in Vietnam, the Viet Lien Front, which is the largest and most powerful front in Vietnamese history. This front is the foundation of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, for resisting the war and building the country. The congress is an important historical event that heralds the great victory of our motherland and our people on the road to a general counter-offensive.
