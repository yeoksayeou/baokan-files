　　Responding to Ma Hengchang Group's Challenge to Create Model Teams
　　Wuhan Holds Labor Model Representative Conference
　　Representatives Send Letter to Japanese Workers Expressing Willingness to Fight Together Against US Arming of Japan
　　The first Wuhan Municipal Labor Model Representative Conference has focused the city's patriotic production competition movement on responding to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge and creating model teams. The conference was held from February 15th to 24th. The meeting summarized the patriotic production competition movement in Wuhan over the past few months, with representatives of twenty-two labor models and two model groups making typical reports. Subsequently, a high tide of responding to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge was initiated by special-class labor models Zhang Wanxing, Liu Qiyu, and others. In order to study the conditions for responding to the challenge, the conference was temporarily adjourned, and labor models returned to their factories to deliberate on the conditions. As a result, forty-one units and one hundred eighty-three groups proposed to respond to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge and challenged each other. During the high tide of response, Guo Suying, the wife of special-class labor model Zhang Wanxing, also issued a challenge to the families of labor models to "take good care of husbands, manage household affairs well, and ensure that husbands can concentrate on production." The Wuhan Municipal People's Government and the Wuhan Municipal Democratic Women's Federation also convened a meeting of labor model family members to discuss and adopt a covenant for families to take good care of husbands and manage household affairs well. Currently, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government are preparing to convene a conference of Party and government cadres from various factories and enterprises to discuss and deploy how to guide and support the aforementioned issue of creating model teams by responding to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge.
　　Before the Labor Model Conference, enterprises in Wuhan had generally carried out the work of evaluating and selecting labor models. A total of more than four thousand people were selected, as well as twelve model production groups. A total of four hundred and thirty-seven labor model representatives and collective model representatives attended the conference. Some of the most outstanding labor model representatives received medals and bonuses from the Wuhan Municipal People's Government at the conference. Before the end of the conference, all labor model representatives jointly wrote a letter to Japanese workers, expressing their determination to fight together with the Japanese working class against the US arming of Japan. After the meeting, a demonstration was held against the US arming of Japan. (Xinhua News Agency)
　　All the representatives of the first Wuhan Municipal Labor Model Representative Conference, on the 24th of last month, jointly wrote a letter to the Japanese working class, expressing their willingness to fight to the end with the Japanese working class against US imperialism's rearming of Japanese fascism.
　　The letter stated: "US imperialism is stepping up preparations for a separate peace treaty with Japan, and is sending the war-monger Dulles to actively engage in activities, attempting to rearm Japanese fascism and provoke a new world war. This seriously threatens our industrial construction and our peaceful and happy life. We clearly remember: from 1942 to 1945, Wuhan's factories suffered severe damage and destruction from Japanese fascism. For example, the First Cotton Mill suffered losses of more than 60%, and the machinery and factory buildings of the mechanized brick and tile industry were mostly destroyed, leading to a complete shutdown. At that time, the lives of our workers were extremely miserable, with no clothes or food, and families were separated. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have rapidly healed our wounds, improved our lives, and the production of some factories has reached the level before the Anti-Japanese War, and some have exceeded it. The threat of unemployment has been gradually eliminated, our wives and children are getting enough to eat and wear, and they have the opportunity to receive education. Therefore, from our painful war experience, we particularly hate aggressive wars and infinitely cherish our labor achievements and our happy lives."
　　The letter said: "US imperialism's conspiracy to rearm Japan and continue to expand its aggressive war equally threatens the interests of you and the entire Japanese people. It drives you and the Japanese people to be cannon fodder and deprives you of the fruits of your labor. Therefore, we know that you also need a life of freedom and happiness, and will never willingly live the painful life of being enslaved under US imperialism's occupation, and will never willingly turn Japan into an American colony. Japanese worker brothers: Let us unite closely, and together with the people of Japan, China, and the world, resolutely shatter US imperialism's arrogant dream of dominating the world, and strive for the early conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan, so that Japan can become a democratic country and your labor achievements can be guaranteed."

　　向马恒昌小组应战创造模范组
    武汉市举行劳动模范代表大会
    与会代表致函日本工人愿为反对美国武装日本而共同奋斗
    武汉市的第一届劳动模范代表大会，已把全市爱国主义生产竞赛运动的中心组织到向马恒昌小组应战、创造模范组上面。这次大会在二月十五日召开，二十四日结束。会议总结了过去几个月来武汉市的爱国主义生产竞赛运动，并有二十二个劳动模范和两个模范小组的代表作了典型报告。接着，向马恒昌小组应战的高潮便由特等劳动模范张万兴、刘启宇等人带头发动起来。为了研究应战条件，大会曾一度休会，由各个劳动模范回厂酝酿应战条件，结果有四十一个单位一百八十三个小组提出向马恒昌小组应战，并相互挑战。在应战高潮中特等劳动模范张万兴的妻子郭素英也向劳动模范们的家属提出“爱护丈夫、搞好家务，保证丈夫专心生产”的挑战；武汉市人民政府和武汉市民主妇女联合会并召开了一次劳动模范家属会议，讨论并通过了家属们爱护丈夫、搞好家务的公约。现中共武汉市委会、市人民政府正准备召开各工厂企业的党、政干部会议，对如何指导和支持上述通过向马恒昌小组应战创造模范组的问题，进行讨论和布置。
    在劳动模范大会前，武汉市各企业单位曾普遍进行了评选劳动模范的工作。全市共计评选出四千多人；另有十二个模范生产小组。出席这次大会的劳动模范代表和集体模范代表共四百三十七人。其中若干成绩最优良的劳动模范代表曾在大会上接受了武汉市人民政府颁发的奖章和奖金。会议结束前，全体劳动模范代表并联名写信给日本工人，表示愿与日本工人阶级为反对美国武装日本而共同奋斗的决心。会后又举行了反对美国武装日本的示威游行。（新华社）
    汉市首届劳动模范代表大会的全体代表，上月二十四日联名写信给日本工人阶级，表示愿与日本工人阶级为反对美帝国主义重新武装日本法西斯而共同奋斗到底。
    信中写道：“美帝国主义正在加紧准备对日单独媾和，并派出战争贩子杜勒斯积极活动，企图重新武装日本法西斯，挑起新的世界大战。这就严重地威胁了我们的工业建设以及我们的和平幸福的生活。我们清晰地记得：武汉市在一九四二年到一九四五年期间，各工厂遭到日本法西斯严重的破坏和摧残，如第一纱厂即损失达百分之六十以上，机制砖瓦业各厂的机件、厂房多被摧毁，以致全部停工。那时我们工人的生活非常惨痛，弄得无衣无食，妻离子散。现在我们在中国共产党领导下，已经迅速地医治了创伤，提高了生活，一部分工厂的生产达到抗日战争前的水平，一部分已经超过。我们失业的威胁已逐步解除，我们的妻儿得到温饱，而且有了受教育的机会。因此，我们从沉痛的战争经历中，特别痛恨侵略战争，无限珍惜我们的劳动果实和我们幸福的生活”。
    信中说：“美帝国主义重新武装日本继续扩大侵略战争的阴谋，同样威胁你们与日本全体人民的利益。驱使你们及日本人民当炮灰，剥夺你们的劳动收获。因此我们知道你们同样需要自由与幸福的生活，决不会甘心过美帝国主义占领下被奴役的痛苦生活，决不会甘愿把日本变为美国殖民地。日本工人兄弟们：让我们亲密的团结起来，和日本、中国以及全世界人民一起，坚决打破美帝国主义独霸世界的狂妄迷梦，争取早日缔结全面的公正的对日和约，使日本成为民主化的国家，也使你们劳动果实得到保障。”（新华社）
