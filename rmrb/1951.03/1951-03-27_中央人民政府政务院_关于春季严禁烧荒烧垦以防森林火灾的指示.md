The forest protection work in various regions last year was generally successful. However, fires were still extremely serious, with over 2,700 forest fires, destroying approximately 2.6 million cubic meters of timber. In the future, we must pay serious attention to forest protection and fire prevention work, establish and improve forestry administrative institutions, and mass forest protection organizations. We must conduct propaganda and education on forest protection and fire prevention for cadres and the masses to implement the central forest protection policy. Now is the spring fire prevention period, and in areas prone to forest and field fires, burning for land reclamation should be strictly prohibited. We should actively persuade the masses to use manual grass cutting instead of burning for land reclamation. It is hoped that you will earnestly arrange, supervise, and inspect this work.

　　中央人民政府政务院
    关于春季严禁烧荒烧垦以防森林火灾的指示
    去年各地的护林工作，一般说是有成绩的。但火灾仍极严重，森林火灾达二千七百余次，烧毁林木约二六○万立米。今后必须严重注意护林防火工作，建立与健全林业行政机构，及群众护林组织对干部及群众进行护林防火的宣传教育，以贯彻中央护林政策。现值春季防火时期，尤应在足以引起林野火灾的地区，严禁烧荒，烧垦，积极说服群众，以人工割草代替烧荒，烧垦，即希切实布置督促检查。
