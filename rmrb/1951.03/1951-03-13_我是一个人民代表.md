　　I am a People's Representative
    As told by Zhou Ruiming, recorded by Yu Fengjuan
    That someone as ordinary as me, uneducated, a woman in her thirties, could become a Municipal People's Representative today is something I never dreamed of before liberation. After liberation, the common people stood up, and I have turned over two or three times.
    My father was a cook, and my mother used to be a servant. When I was eight years old, my father took another woman outside and stopped taking care of the family, so I lived a hard life with my mother. At that time, my mother always told me, and I thought so myself: "Being born a woman is the most unfortunate thing, our mother and daughter have such bad luck." To get rid of this miserable fate, we used to fast and chant Buddhist scriptures all day long, but it was useless at all. When I was fourteen, my mother found me a husband and got me married. After marriage, my husband and I didn't get along, and we quarreled every now and then. I don't know how many times I was beaten by him. He looked down on women, saying that women couldn't achieve anything and could only raise children. I lived such a mediocre life for more than twenty years.
    In the winter of 1948, the People's Liberation Army besieged Beijing. I heard people say that the Eighth Route Army "communized property and wives" and "killed and set fires." I thought that good people had no way to survive in this world. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, a company headquarters lived in our neighbor's yard, and I was so scared that I didn't dare to go out. But later, I saw that they lived peacefully and even swept the yard and did chores; sometimes they borrowed pots and bowls from me, calling me "Auntie" in a very kind tone; even the company commander came to our house to chat. Slowly, I realized that they were all good people who were making revolution and fighting Chiang Kai-shek to let the common people live a good life. What I heard before were all rumors fabricated by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army told me that women could also participate in the revolution, and there were many female comrades in the army. They also told many stories of women in the old liberated areas resisting Japan. I was so happy to hear that women could also achieve great things! I told these things to my neighbors, and they said that I had made progress.
    The work team came to the alley and discussed doing cleaning work with everyone, so I participated. From then on, I often came out to attend meetings and do some work. Soon, I was elected as the leader of the security group. I was willing to work hard, but I felt that I had low education and too little new knowledge. After the cultural center established a study class, I quickly signed up. In the study, I understood many principles. I learned the principle of "labor creating the world" and stopped being superstitious. I knew that it was glorious to work for everyone. What moved me the most was Comrade Liu, who taught the political class. He was a Communist Party member with severe tuberculosis. He couldn't stand for long, but he insisted on teaching us. I believed in the Communist Party and loved Chairman Mao.
    When I went out to attend meetings or study and returned home, my husband would pull a long face and say: "Running out all day, you still have to come home to eat! I thought you were full from attending meetings." My mother-in-law also said: "You are so old, and you want to study again. You won't become a scholar even if you study more." I didn't say anything, and slowly told them what I learned, and read articles from the "Beijing Women" magazine to my mother-in-law. My family is in the bookbinding business. After liberation, there was more work. I got up early every day to help with bookbinding, counting, and bundling. In the afternoon, I made dinner early and then went to night school. Sometimes, if I made dinner late, I would skip dinner and rush to class. My family no longer stopped me.
    At the beginning of the year, at the district people's representative conference, I was honorably elected as a district representative. At that time, I felt a little proud of myself, but at the representative conference, I received a profound education. I saw the district cadres warmly receive us; when the responsible comrades spoke, they repeatedly stated that the people's representatives were elected by the masses, that being a people's representative was glorious, and that they should be good servants of the masses. All this deeply moved me. I knew that pride and complacency were unacceptable. After the meeting, I dared not forget for a moment that I was a servant of the people and that I had to work hard for everyone. For example, when I was also the health committee member, at first everyone was unwilling to sweep the streets, so I patiently persuaded everyone and personally swept for them. Later, they were all willing to come out to sweep. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, I participated in the propaganda team and spent several days holding a loudspeaker, propagandizing to the masses in the streets. When I returned home at night, I felt my mouth was dry and my lips were parched, and my legs were weak. But I thought that this was the responsibility of a people's representative, and when I thought of the soldiers fighting the American devils on the front lines, I didn't feel tired. When I went to each household to propagandize, the old women greeted us warmly and said: "You are too tired, have some water and rest!" Many people comforted me like this, and I worked even harder.
    The neighbors are very close to me, and they are willing to talk to me about anything they can't figure out. I always try my best to help them solve problems. Sometimes when I was eating, if I encountered a couple fighting or a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarreling, I couldn't eat anymore, and I would put down my rice and go to mediate and persuade them. I hate the feudal ideas that oppress women the most, and I always care about the pain of my sisters, because I have personally suffered!
    At this district representative meeting, when I was nominated to participate in the third session of the municipal people's representative conference, I did not expect to be elected. At that time, my heart jumped up, and I felt both happy and worried. Everyone applauded and welcomed me to speak. I ran onto the stage and was so excited that I couldn't say a word for a long time. Finally, I said: "I only have one thought, that is, this glorious responsibility was given to me by the masses; it was brought by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I have poor ability and many shortcomings, I can only learn more from everyone, and I hope everyone will help me. I will definitely not be afraid of difficulties and will work hard to take on the job."

### 我是一个人民代表

　　我是一个人民代表
    周瑞明讲  于凤娟记
    凭我这样一个平平常常，没文化，三十多岁的娘儿们，今天能做了市人民代表，真是从前做梦也想不到的事。解放后，老百姓都翻了身，我可是翻了两三个过。
    我娘家爹是个厨师父，妈原先给人家当用人。我八岁那年，爹在外边又弄了个女人，不管家了，我就跟着娘过苦日子。那时妈总这样给我说，我自己也这样想：“脱生个女人是最不幸的，我们娘儿俩命太不好。”为了摆脱这苦难的命运，我们曾经整天吃斋念佛，但是一点用都没有。十四岁时妈就给我找了个婆家结了婚。婚后和丈夫脾气合不来，三天两头吵架，我不知挨过他多少打。他瞧不起女人，说女人成不了事，就只能养孩子。我就这样窝窝囊囊地过了二十多年。
    一九四八年冬天，解放军围了北京城。我听见别人说：八路军“共产共妻”、“杀人放火”。心想这世道好人怎么也是没有活路了。解放军进了城，我们邻居院里住了一个连部，吓得我连门都不敢出。可是后来，我看他们住得挺安生，还给扫院子干活；有时他们向我借盆借碗，一口一声“大娘”，说话非常和善；连长他们还来我们家聊天。慢慢地我才知道了，他们都是好人，为了让老百姓过好日子，才闹革命打蒋二秃子。我从前听的，全是国民党反动派造的谣言。解放军的同志们告诉我，妇女也一样能干革命，部队里就有不少女同志，又讲了许多老解放区妇女抗日的故事，我听了可真高兴极了，妇女也能成大事啊！我把这些事，说给邻居听，她们说我进步了。
    工作组到胡同来，和大家商量做清洁工作，我就参加了。从那时起我就常出来开会，做些工作，不久竟被选上了治安组长。我愿意使着劲儿工作，可就是感到文化低，新知识太少。文化馆成立了学习班后，我赶紧去报了名。在学习中，我懂了很多道理，我学了“劳动创造世界”的道理，就不再迷信了。我知道了为大伙办事是光荣的。最使我感动的，是教政治课的刘同志，他是个共产党员，带着很厉害的结核病，站的功夫大了就支持不住，但还坚持着给我们上课。我信服共产党，敬爱毛主席了。
    我出去开会或学习，回到家里，丈夫就拉着脸子说：“成天往外跑，还是得回家吃饭啊！我当你开会开饱了呢。”婆婆也说：“这么大人了，又想起念书来了。再念也成不了秀才。”我不做声，过后慢慢地给她们讲我学习的东西，又把《北京妇女》杂志上的文章念给婆婆听。我家里是装订行，解放后，活计多起来了，我天天早早起来，帮助装订，数活，捆活；下午早做出饭来然后去上夜校，有时候做晚了，我就饭也不吃赶去上课，家里再不拦挡我了。
    头年里，开区各界人民代表会议，我光荣地当选了区代表。当时觉得自己有些了不起，但在代表会议上，我受到了深刻的教育。我看到区干部们热诚地招待我们；负责同志讲话时，都一再说明了人民代表是群众选出来的，做一个人民代表是光荣的，要很好地做群众的勤务员。这一切深深地感动了我，我知道了骄傲自满要不得。会后我一时也不敢忘记我是人民的勤务员，要好好地为大伙工作。比方我兼卫生委员时，起初大家都不愿扫街，我就耐心说服大家，并且亲自代他们扫。后来，他们就都乐意出来扫了。抗美援朝运动中，我参加了宣传队，一连几天拿着大喇叭，在街头向群众宣传。天黑回到家里，觉着嘴干唇焦，腿也软了。但我认为这是一个人民代表的责任，再想想在前方打美国鬼子的战士们，就不觉累了。到各户去宣传时，老大娘们都亲热地招呼我们说：“你们太劳累了，快喝点水休息休息吧！”这样安慰我的人很多，我干得就更有劲儿了。
    街坊邻居们和我很亲近，有什么解不开的事，都愿意来和我谈谈。我总是尽着自己的能力去帮助他们解决问题。有时我吃饭时，碰上街坊夫妇打架，婆媳闹气，我就再也吃不下去，扔下饭就去调解劝说。我最恨压迫妇女的封建思想，我时时关心妇女姐妹的痛苦，因为我亲身受过啊！
    这次在全区区代表会上，推选参加本市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议的代表，没有想到我竟当选了，当时我的心马上跳了起来，觉着又高兴又耽心。大家鼓掌欢迎我讲话，我跑上台来，兴奋得半天也说不出一句话来。最后我说：“我只有一点感想，就是我这个光荣的责任，是群众交给我的；是毛主席和共产党带来的。我能力差，缺点多，只有多向大家学习，希望大伙帮助我。我一定不怕困难把工作努力地担下来。”
