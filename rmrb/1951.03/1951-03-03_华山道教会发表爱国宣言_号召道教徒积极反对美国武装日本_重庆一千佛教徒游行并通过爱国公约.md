Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: The heads of 28 temples affiliated with the Huashan Taoist Association, one of China's five great mountains, including Wang Qingzhen, held a symposium on resisting America and aiding Korea on the 16th. At the symposium, they adopted and issued a patriotic declaration, calling on Taoists across the country to participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country, and to oppose US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

Fellow Taoists across the country: As the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country is being vigorously carried out across the country, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Catholicism, and other religions have all expressed their patriotic will and propositions. We, the Taoists and heads of various temples on Mount Huashan, are unwilling to lag behind in this movement. We held a symposium at the Shifangyuan in Huashan on February 16th. At the meeting, all the masters unanimously expressed their opposition to US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan, and their determination to fight for the permanent peace of the world. All of us Taoists are willing to be citizens of the People's Republic of China who abide by the law under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, and to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country together with the people of the whole country and other religious organizations.

In the new China, freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by our Common Program. We call on the Taoist community across the country to unite and resolutely oppose US imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea; oppose US imperialism's arming of Japan and enslavement of the Chinese and Asian people; and oppose bandits, secret agents, and reactionary elements using secret societies to fabricate rumors and carry out all counter-revolutionary and anti-people activities. We Taoists must study hard, improve our understanding, work hard in production, and use this practical action to express our determination to resist America and aid Korea.

We shout: Long live the Central People's Government! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the permanent victory of world democratic peace!
