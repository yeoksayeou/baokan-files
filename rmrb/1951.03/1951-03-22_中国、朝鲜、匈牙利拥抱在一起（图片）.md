　　China, North Korea, and Hungary Embrace
    —Artwork by Huang Jing—
    Editor's Note: These are comic strips created by Comrade Huang Jing based on Comrade Du Gao's North Korean correspondence published in this newspaper on February 17th. The entire set consists of eighteen panels and will be serialized over six days, starting today.
   (1) A transport truck filled with medicine departs from Pyongyang. Just as the truck was about to leave, Political Commissar Zhang made a special trip to shake the hand of the escort, Wang Huaiduo, saying: "Comrade, remember, this entire truckload of medicine is a gift from the Hungarian people!"
   (2) In the dark of night, the truck quickly left Pyongyang, and then sped along the slippery, frigid, and snowy mountains. Wang Huaiduo and the North Korean Comrade Jin sat shoulder to shoulder on the medicine boxes. The biting cold wind was like needles pricking their faces, causing ice to form on their eyebrows and beards.
    (3) When the medicine truck crossed the Datong River, it was so dark that almost nothing could be seen. The snow continued to fall, the sky was dark, and the water was dark. (To be continued)

　　中国、朝鲜、匈牙利拥抱在一起
    —黄景作—
    编者按：这是黄景同志根据本报二月十七日发表杜高同志的朝鲜通讯所作的连环画。全套共十八幅，从今日起在六天内连载完毕。
   （一）装满了药品的运输车，从平壤出发了。车子临开的时候，张政委还特别赶来握着押运员王怀铎的手说：“同志，要记牢啊，这满车的药品都是匈牙利人民送给我们的！”
   （二）在黑夜里，车子一会儿就出了平壤，一会儿又疾驶在严寒冰雪的滑溜的峻岭上。王怀铎和朝鲜老金同志肩靠着肩坐在药品箱上，刺骨的冷风像针一样地扎在他们的脸上，使得他们的眉毛和胡须也都结上了冰。
    （三）药品车过大同江的时候，天黑得几乎半点都看不见，雪在继续落，天是黑的，水也是黑的。（未完）
