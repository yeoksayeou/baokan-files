　　Tianjin: Several private and joint public-private enterprises in Tianjin have distributed dividends for the past year due to substantial surpluses. These include large and medium-sized enterprises such as the private Dongya Enterprise Company, the private Shoufeng and Fuxing Flour Companies, the private Fuzhong Trading Company, and the joint public-private Yaohua Glass Company and Huaxin Textile Company. Dongya, Shoufeng, Fuxing, and Fuzhong companies have also distributed bonuses. The private Yongli and Jiuda companies have provided a portion of the shareholders' living expenses. In addition, some private enterprises are planning to distribute dividends. Dongya Company's 1950 jute bag production increased by more than 36% compared to the pre-liberation peak in 1941, with a net profit of over 8.2 billion yuan. Shoufeng and Fuxing companies each achieved a net profit of over 1 billion yuan last year. Yaohua Company's surplus last year increased by 50% compared to the previous year. From March to December last year, Huaxin Company's yarn and cloth production increased by 60% to 80% compared to the same period in the previous year, with a net profit of 11.9 billion yuan. When distributing surpluses, companies generally follow their operating conditions and original articles of association, and some also follow the provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises." Dongya, Shoufeng, Fuxing, and Yaohua companies have all proposed 10% to 20% for public reserve funds. Each company has also allocated a portion of the surplus as employee welfare funds and bonuses. According to the Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises, Yaohua Company first allocated 20% of the surplus as a public reserve fund; then, from the remaining balance, 2.8 billion yuan was distributed as dividends (not exceeding 8%); then, from the remaining balance, 60% was allocated as shareholder bonuses and remuneration for supervisors, managers, etc., 30% as employee safety, health, and welfare funds, and 10% as research and experimentation expenses. During the discussion on dividend distribution, the public shareholder directors and supervisors of the company carefully listened to the opinions of the private shareholder directors and supervisors. Both sides conducted earnest research, and the private shareholders were very satisfied with the distribution method, greatly increasing their confidence in management. Currently, some companies are preparing to further expand production. Huaxin Company is preparing to add 10,000 spindles. Dongya Company plans to increase its production by more than 50% this year compared to last year. Shoufeng Company plans to increase production by 20% this year and is preparing to build new employee dormitories. Yaohua Company has also decided to expand the Qinhuangdao factory and strive for the early start of the Shanghai factory.
