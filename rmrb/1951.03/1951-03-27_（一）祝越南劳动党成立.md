　　(I) Congratulations on the Founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party
　　The vanguard of the Vietnamese working class – the Vietnam Workers' Party – was founded in February. The National Congress for the establishment of the Vietnam Workers' Party was held in a certain place in North Vietnam from February 11th to 19th. This congress adopted the Vietnam Workers' Party's declaration to the people of Vietnam, the program of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the constitution of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and resolutions on the work of the Party, and elected the Central Executive Committee of the Party. The establishment of the Vietnam Workers' Party is a significant achievement in the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberation. We warmly congratulate the working class and working people of Vietnam on this victory.
　　The establishment of the Vietnam Workers' Party is of course of great significance for the Vietnamese people's struggle against the aggression of French and American imperialism and for the liberation of all of Vietnam. The theories of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of the Chinese revolution all point out that the modern anti-imperialist people's revolution must be led by a revolutionary party of the working class to achieve victory. Comrade Mao Zedong, in summarizing the experience of the Chinese revolution, said: "We have many valuable experiences. A disciplined party armed with the theories of Marxism, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, employing the method of self-criticism and linked with the masses of the people. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and all revolutionary factions led by such a party. These three are the main experiences." ("On People's Democratic Dictatorship") Among these three experiences of the Chinese people's victory, the first experience, namely, building a Marxist-Leninist working-class party, is the most important experience, because only under the leadership of such a revolutionary party can a strong people's army and a strong revolutionary united front be built, and can the ferocious imperialism and its running dogs – the domestic reactionaries – be defeated. It can thus be seen how important the establishment of the Vietnam Workers' Party will be in the arduous struggle of the Vietnamese people against the aggression of French and American imperialism.
　　The Party Program adopted by the National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party pointed out the correct goals of the Vietnamese people in the current revolutionary stage and the correct policies to be followed to achieve these goals. This document points out: "The primary task of the Vietnamese revolution is to expel the imperialist aggressors, to achieve complete independence and unity for the people, to eliminate the colonial system in the enemy-occupied areas, to eradicate the remnants of feudalism and semi-feudalism, so that the tiller has his land; to develop the people's democratic government, and to lay the foundation for socialism." This document also points out: "At the present stage, the spearhead of the Vietnamese revolution is directed against the imperialists. Its purpose is to unite all the forces of the people, consolidate the national united front, and resolutely fight against the imperialist aggressors and their running dogs. At the same time, it must also try to improve the living conditions of the people, especially the working masses, so that they can participate more actively in the war of resistance."
　　This document stipulates fifteen specific policies that the Party plans to implement during the Liberation War and after the end of the Liberation War, which are to continue the war of resistance until complete victory, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, to consolidate the national united front, to establish and develop a regular army and a people's army of militia and guerrillas, to develop the people's economy under the principle of benefiting both public and private sectors, and labor and capital, to implement land reform step by step through measures such as reducing rent and interest and confiscating and distributing the land of traitors and public land, to develop a national, scientific, and mass culture and education, to guarantee the people's freedom of religious belief and oppose the use of religion by French imperialism to deceive the people and divide the Vietnamese national united front, to implement a policy of equality, unity, and mutual assistance among ethnic minorities, to strengthen work in enemy-occupied areas and newly liberated areas, to strengthen friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, to unite and assist the people of Laos and Cambodia, to protect law-abiding foreign nationals, to unite the people of all countries to defend world peace, and to carry out patriotic emulation.
　　The principles and specific policies contained in the Vietnam Workers' Party Program are all needed for the cause of Vietnamese national liberation at the present stage. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people will surely steadily achieve the great goal of "completing national liberation, developing people's democracy, and advancing towards socialism."

　　（一）祝越南劳动党成立
    越南工人阶级的先锋队——越南劳动党已于二月间成立。为成立越南劳动党而召开的全国代表大会已于二月十一日到十九日在北越某地举行。这个大会通过了越南劳动党对越南全国人民的宣言，越南劳动党纲领，越南劳动党党章和关于党的工作的决议，并选出了党的中央执行委员会。越南劳动党的成立，是越南人民解放斗争的重大收获。我们热烈地祝贺越南工人阶级和劳动人民的这个胜利。
    越南劳动党的成立，对于越南人民反抗法国和美国帝国主义进攻，解放全越南的斗争，当然有极重大的意义。列宁、斯大林的学说和中国革命的经验都指明：现代反帝国主义的人民革命，必须有一个工人阶级的革命政党来领导，才能取得胜利。毛泽东同志在总结中国革命的经验时说：“我们有许多宝贵的经验。一个有纪律的有马、恩、列、斯的理论武装的采取自我批评方法的联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶层各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是主要的经验。”（《论人民民主专政》）中国人民取得胜利的这三个经验中，第一个经验，即建设一个马克思列宁主义的工人阶级的政党，又是最主要的经验，因为只有在这样的革命政党的领导下，才能建设坚强的人民军队和坚强的革命统一战线，才能战胜凶恶的帝国主义及其走狗——本国的反动派。由此可见，越南劳动党的成立，在越南人民反对法美帝国主义侵略的艰巨斗争中将占有多么重要的地位。
    越南劳动党全国代表大会所通过的党纲，指出了越南人民在目前革命阶段的正确目标，和为达到这个目标而遵循的正确政策。这个文件指出：“越南革命的首要任务是要驱逐帝国主义侵略者，使人民得到完全的独立与统一，消灭敌占区内的殖民制度，根绝封建主义与半封建主义的残余，使耕者有其田；发展人民民主政权，并为社会主义奠定基础。”这个文件又指出：“在目前阶段，越南革命的矛头是针对着帝国主义者。它的目的是要团结人民的一切力量，巩固民族统一阵线，坚决地对帝国主义侵略者及其走狗们战斗。同时，它还要设法改善人民的、特别是劳动群众的生活条件，好使他们更积极地参加抗战。”
    这个文件规定了党在解放战争期间及解放战争结束以后计划实行的十五项具体政策，这就是继续抗战直到完全胜利，巩固人民民主专政的政权，巩固民族统一阵线，建立和发展正规军和民兵、游击队的人民军队，在公私兼顾、劳资两利的原则下发展人民经济，经过减租减息没收分配卖国贼的土地及公共的土地等项措施有步骤地实行土地改革，发展民族的、科学的和人民大众的文化与教育，保障人民信仰宗教自由并反对法帝国主义利用宗教来欺骗人民和分化越南民族统一阵线的政策，实行平等团结互助的少数民族政策，加强对敌占区和新解放区的工作，加强与苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家间的友好关系，团结和援助老挝及柬埔寨人民，保护守法外侨，联合各国人民保卫世界和平，进行爱国主义竞赛。
    越南劳动党纲领所包含的各项原则和具体政策，都是现阶段的越南民族解放事业所需要的。我们深信：越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的正确领导下，必能稳步地达到“完成民族解放，发展人民民主，向社会主义前进”的伟大目标。
