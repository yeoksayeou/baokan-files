　　Anecdotes of Seoul
    Special correspondent of this newspaper: Yang Shuo
    After the blizzard had swept through, the wind changed and the sky cleared up. The ice and snow in the mountains and fields began to melt, and the ground became muddy, revealing a fishy smell of soil. On the evening I entered Seoul, I smelled the scent of spring for the first time this year.

    This city is surrounded by mountains and hills, and is close to the Han River in the south, which is very beautiful. If you climb Namsan Mountain in the city, you can see some high-rise buildings in the Namdaemun area. The rest of the city is almost entirely rows of neat bungalows with upturned eaves covered with long, glazed tiles, just like small Chinese temples. Near the north of the city, you can see a palace. This is Changdeokgung Palace, where King Yi of Korea lived two hundred years ago. In China in earlier years, I heard Korean comrades sing an ancient song in a mournful tone several times: "May you be well, Changdeokgung..." Of course, they were not hoping for the restoration of the emperor, but singing out the pain of the Korean people's subjugation. Their goal of fighting was for a free new Korea.

    Seoul has written down some pages of the heroic war history of the Korean people.

    In June 1950, after Syngman Rhee's attack on North Korea failed, Seoul could not be defended. He fled across the Han River overnight, and, fearing that the People's Army would pursue him, he hurriedly blew up the Han River Bridge. The defeated army behind him did not know this and only wanted to escape, and the cars scrambled to drive onto the bridge. It was a moonless night. The cars at the front fell into the river, but those behind could not see and kept driving forward, one car, two cars, three cars... falling into the water, almost filling the river surface. When the People's Army wanted to cross the river to pursue the enemy, they immediately rushed to repair a pontoon bridge. They repaired it at night, and the enemy bombed it during the day; they bombed it and then repaired it again, persisting until the People's Army was able to cross the Han River in an endless stream.

    The Seoul Defense War in October was even more amazing. The Korean translator Lao Sun, who came into the city with me this time, was one of the participants at that time. He stood on Dunam-dong in the northeast corner of the city and pointed to the whole city and said to me, "At that time, the American imperialists landed in Incheon, trying to occupy Seoul at once and cut off the People's Army's retreat at the front. A small part of our troops guarded the mountains in the south of the city. With the help of a large number of enemy planes, they attacked the city during the day, but we drove them out at night. After guarding it for eight days and eight nights, we retreated in a planned manner. At that time, the old people in the city stood up, carrying sticks, knives, and other things, to send food to the army and fight alongside the army. On the day we retreated, the old people watched our retreating figures, and some cried. I also wanted to cry, and waved to them and said, 'It's okay, folks, we'll be back in a few days!'"

    These brave soldiers, with the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, finally came back. The enemy, however, collapsed all the way from the north, fleeing Seoul without a fight. Once past the 38th parallel, the enemy's embarrassment could be seen everywhere. The so-called 38th parallel is just a barbed wire fence, but it separates North and South Korea. The enemy filled the front of the barbed wire with landmines and dug a trench behind the wire, attempting to stop the advance of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Of course, this was useless. Even now, the enemy's corpses are still lying in the trenches. Further ahead, along the road were destroyed Jeeps, trucks, tanks, artillery... Stiff corpses often appeared in the snow caves, some from Syngman Rhee's bandit army, and some from the American army. That evening, we walked into the city through the snow and ice, passed through the wide urban area through the quaint Dongdaemun Gate, and walked to Namdaemun Gate. The whole city was dark, and there was a big fire burning in one place. There were often patrols of the People's Army on the street, and occasionally one or two pedestrians could be seen. On a dark and cold street corner, a six- or seven-year-old child was crying loudly. The translator Lao Sun asked him a few questions and then said in a low voice, "He said he's all alone!" Not far away, we heard another child sitting by the roadside crying and shouting, "Mom! Mom!"

    These are all the sufferings that the American imperialists have left to Seoul. That night, I stayed at the home of a Korean comrade named Li Qingqiu. He wrote on paper: "Now Seoul is a dead city!" Indeed, the enemy has greatly damaged the vitality of this city. The hydroelectric power plant was blown up, the large factory in Yongsan was blown up, and the three large bridges on the Han River were also blown up. The whole city originally had a population of 1.5 million, but now there are only 50,000 to 60,000 old, weak, and disabled people left. Comrade Li Qingqiu talked to me with a pen, and he wrote that before the enemy fled, they arrested 400,000 young people from Seoul to serve as "Second National Soldiers," and spread rumors to the old people, saying that when the Chinese People's Volunteers came, they would rape, plunder, and kill, leaving no chickens or dogs undisturbed, and asked the citizens to follow them, and those who did not run would be punished as "red elements." A most tragic picture of refugees appeared on the Suwon front line. Endless old people wandered in the blizzard, carrying their families with them, crying from hunger and cold. Enemy planes were constantly strafing overhead. Those who froze to death and starved to death lay everywhere. Many people realized that this was the enemy's poisonous trick, and when they had the chance, they ran back. When they reached the Han River, the water was deep and cold, and the children could not cross the river. The volunteer soldiers took off their shoes, carried the children on their shoulders, and sent them back and forth to the north bank. The deceived citizens then sighed and said, "The volunteers are merciful soldiers!" It spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, and more people ran back, one after another, day and night.

    MacArthur is really daydreaming. These two days, he has been patching together his defeated soldiers and harassing Suwon again. During the day, the rumbling of artillery fire can be heard in Seoul. At night, many flares are fired in the distance south of the city, and the sky is as red as a fire. But with the powerful volunteer army and the People's Army, the enemy will once again be battered and bruised. On the evening of January 30, when I left Seoul, I met many volunteer comrades carrying burdens and driving livestock, all of whom were buying vegetables from the city to take back. Further ahead, I met many trucks and four-horse carriages, loaded with white and fat pigs, being transported from the rear to the front. The Lunar New Year is coming, and our volunteers are preparing to spend a victorious Spring Festival.
          
          Early February 1950, in Korea.

　　汉城杂录
    本报特约记者  杨朔
    漫天大风雪吹过去后，风一变，放晴了。山野的冰雪开始融化，地面化得泥汤浆水的，透出股泥土的腥气。我进汉城的那天傍晚，头一次闻到今年春天的气味。
    这座都市四围环抱着山岭，南面紧靠汉江，十分秀丽。你要是爬上市内的南山一望，南大门一带还有些高楼大厦，全城其余地方几乎全是密密排列着的整齐平房，檐角飞起，盖着琉璃瓦式的长瓦，跟中国小庙一模一样。靠城北，可以了见一片宫殿。这是二百年前朝鲜李太王所住的昌德宫。早些年在中国，我几次听见朝鲜同志用悲凉的调子唱着个古歌：“愿你安好，昌德宫……”他们当然不是希望帝王的复辟，只是唱出朝鲜人民亡国的惨痛。他们战斗的目标是为着一个自由的新朝鲜。
    汉城就曾写下朝鲜人民英雄的战史的一些篇页。
    一九五○年六月，李承晚进攻北朝鲜失败后，汉城不保，连夜逃过汉江，又怕人民军追上去，慌忙炸断江桥。后面的匪军不知道，只想逃命，汽车争着开上桥去。当时是个无月之夜，前头的汽车掉到江里去，后边看不见，还是朝前开，一辆、两辆、三辆……跌下水去，江面差不多都填平了。人民军要过江追击敌人，立时抢修便桥。晚间修，敌人白天炸；炸了又修，一直坚持着，使人民大军源源地渡过汉江。
    十月的汉城保卫战更惊人。这次跟我一块进城的朝鲜翻译老孙便是当时参加人之一。他站在城东北角敦岩洞上，指点着全城对我说道：“那时候美帝国主义从仁川登陆，想一下子占领汉城，切断前方人民军的后路。我们一小部分队伍守在城南那一带山头上。敌人在大批飞机助战下，白天攻进城，黑夜就叫我们赶出去。守了八天八夜，我们才全线有计划地撤退了。当时城里老百姓都起来了，拿着棍子刀子等等东西，给军队送吃的、跟着军队一块打仗。我们撤退那天，老百姓望着我们的后影，有的哭了。我也是想哭，对他们挥着手说：‘不要紧，老乡，过些日子我们就回来了！’”
    这些英勇的战士得到中国志愿军的援助，到底又回来了。敌人却是从北边一路溃败下来，不战而逃出汉城。一过三八线，到处可以见到敌人的狼狈像。所谓三八线，只是一道铁丝网，却隔开南北朝鲜。敌人在铁丝网前布满地雷，网后挖了一条战壕，企图阻止朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军前进。这当然没用。直到现在，战壕里还丢着美军的死尸。再往前走，沿路是打坏的吉普车、大卡车、坦克、大炮……雪窟窿里时常露出僵硬的尸首，有李承晚的匪军，也有美军。那天傍晚，我们踏着满地冰雪走进城去，从古色古香的东大门穿过宽整的市区，走到南大门。全城黑沉沉的，有一处正燃烧着大火。街上常有巡逻的人民军，间或也碰见一两个行人。在一个又黑又冷的街角上，有个六、七岁的小孩哇哇地直哭。翻译老孙问了他几句，回头低低说道：“他说就他一个人！”走不远，又听见一个小孩坐在路边上哭着叫道：“阿妈呀！阿妈呀！”
    这都是美帝给汉城留下的苦难。当晚，我宿在一位叫李青求的朝鲜同志家里。他在纸上写道：“现在汉城死的都市！”不错，敌人是大大损伤了这座城市的元气。水电厂炸了，龙山的大工场炸了，汉江上三道大桥也都炸了。全城原有一百五十万人口，现在却只剩下老弱残废五、六万人。李青求同志跟我笔谈，他写道，敌人逃跑前，从汉城抓走四十万青年去当“第二国民兵”，又对老百姓造谣，说中国志愿军一来，奸淫烧杀、鸡犬不宁，叫市民跟着他们跑，不跑就当“赤色分子”处分。水原前线，便出现了一幅人间最惨的流民图。无穷无尽的老百姓流亡在大风雪里，携家带口、啼饥号寒，头上又不断有敌机扫射，冻死的，饿死的，横倒竖卧，遍地都是，许多人明白过来这是敌人的毒计，得空便往回跑。跑到汉江岸上，水深而冷，小孩过不了河。志愿军的战士脱了鞋，把小孩扛到肩上，来往将他们送到北岸。受骗的市民这才叹息着说：“志愿军是仁慈的军人！”一传十，十传百，往回跑的人更多了，陆陆续续的，白天黑夜不断。
    麦克阿瑟真在做白日梦，这两天拚凑着他的残兵败将，又向水原骚扰。白天，汉城能听到隆隆的炮声，一到晚上，城南的远空打起许多照明弹，火烧似的一片通红。但是有强大的志愿军和人民军在，敌人又要碰得头破血流的。一月三十号晚上，我出汉城，遇到许多志愿军的同志，挑着担子，赶着牲口，都是从城里买菜回去的。往前，迎面又碰见许多卡车，四套马大车，装满又白又肥的大猪，从后方运上前线。阴历年到来了，我们的志愿军正准备着度过一个胜利春节。
          一九五○年二月初，于朝鲜。
