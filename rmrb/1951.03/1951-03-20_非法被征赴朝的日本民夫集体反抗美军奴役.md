Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Japanese civilians, illegally conscripted by the American and Japanese reactionaries to serve the American army in the Korean War, have collectively resisted the enslavement by the American military due to their dissatisfaction. According to the Japanese progressive newspaper "Peace and Independence," based on accounts from Japanese civilians who were secretly conscripted to Korea last year and have returned to Japan, two groups of Japanese civilians, each consisting of 1,300 people, were sent from Yokohama to Korea in October and November last year. When the ship carrying the second group of civilians passed through Moji on November 14th, the civilians resolutely demanded to disembark, but were met with bloody suppression, and some were shot dead. The rest were sent to Korea.

　　After the Japanese civilians were sent to the American military defense areas, they were divided into two shifts and took turns on duty. They were forced to搬运 (bānyùn - carry) rocket launchers, bullets, barbed wire, asphalt and other military supplies. Unable to bear this heavy labor, the Japanese civilians demanded one after another: "Let us go back quickly!" They collectively refused to serve, and some deserted. They also suffered slave-like treatment from the American military in their lives. In the severe cold of thirty degrees below zero, they only wore a set of trousers and jackets. The main food was thin porridge. Because they could not bear the hunger, they opened American military warehouses and seized food. As the American invading forces suffered a disastrous defeat under the blows of the Korean and Chinese People's armies, their courage to resist also increased. They resentfully secretly threw American weapons, ammunition, etc. into the sea. Although the American military tortured them with cruel punishments, the resistance never ceased.

　　The Japanese workers in Yokohama were extremely angry after hearing the news of the inhuman treatment of the conscripted workers. The call against conscription is increasing among them.

　　非法被征赴朝的日本民夫集体反抗美军奴役
    【新华社十六日讯】被美日反动派非法征募为侵朝美军服役的日本民夫，因不满美军的奴役，曾进行集体反抗。据日本进步报纸《和平与独立报》消息：据已回到日本的去年被秘密征募到朝鲜去的日本民夫说：去年十月、十一月间，有两批日本民夫被从横滨送到朝鲜，每批均为一千三百人。当第二批民夫所乘的轮船在十一月十四日路经门司时，民夫们曾坚决要求离船上岸，竟遭到血腥镇压，若干人被枪毙。其余的人被送到朝鲜。
    日本民夫被送到美军防地后，即被分成两班，轮流值勤。他们被驱使搬运火箭筒、子弹、铁丝网、柏油等军用品。由于不堪这种繁重的苦役，日本民夫们纷纷要求：“赶快让我们回去！”他们集体拒绝服役，并有人开小差。他们在生活上也遭到美军的奴隶般的待遇。他们在零下三十度的严寒气候中，仅穿一套裤褂。主要的伙食是稀粥。他们因不堪饥饿，曾打开美军仓库，夺取食物。当美国侵略军在朝中人民军队的打击下遭受惨败后，他们反抗的勇气也因而增加。他们愤恨地暗中将美军的武器、弹药等抛入海中。美军虽用酷刑拷打他们，但反抗从未中止。
    横滨的日本工人听到被征者的非人的遭遇的消息后，激愤异常。反对征兵和拉夫的呼声，在他们之间正日益增高。
