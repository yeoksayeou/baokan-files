Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd. To further eliminate the obstruction of imperialist elements and carry out the self-governing and self-supporting reform movement, Tianjin Catholics held a forum on the 20th. Among those present were Wu Kezhai, Zhang Yushi, and Nie Guoping, members of the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association Preparatory Committee, Zhao Zhenya, Deputy Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese of the Catholic Church, and Fathers Hui Ruyu, Wang Sixian, Li Depei, and Li Futing, as well as church member representatives Liang Jundong and Liu Bocixiong, totaling 66 people. At the meeting, Liang Jundong, a church member from Sandeli Church, accused the Dutch priest Ning Shoudao of tearing down the proclamation issued by Deputy Bishop Zhao Zhenya, calling on all Catholics in the city to respond to the self-governing and self-supporting reform movement, under the instruction of the French bishop Wen Guibin.

Deputy Bishop Zhao Zhenya said: The Catholic self-governing and self-supporting reform movement in Tianjin has made considerable progress, but many Catholics still do not understand or do not deeply understand the significance of the self-governing and self-supporting reform movement. In the future, all priests in the city should unite with the promoters to widely carry out publicity and promote the patriotic reform movement of Catholicism with further practical actions.

Father Zhang Jizhong of Hejiakou Church said: Now the people of the whole country have devoted themselves to the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and Catholics cannot and should not stand idly by. How to continue to promote reform in the future should be expressed with further actions. Some foreign priests in several churches are still trying to obstruct the reform movement, and we will never allow it!

Father Liu Pinyi of Jinwei Bridge Church said: It is a matter of course for Chinese people to run the Chinese church. Some people say that it is impossible without foreign money, which is a shameful statement.

Father Li Depei of Jijiazhuang Church, Father Yang Rang of Wanghailou Church, and Father Wang Xier of Xiaowangzhuang Church all said: The Catholic self-governing and self-supporting reform movement in Tianjin has gone through some twists and turns, but finally overcame the difficulties and took a step forward. In the future, we should continue to work hard and be vigilant against the sabotage conspiracies of imperialist elements.

Then, Liang Jundong, a church member of Sandeli Church, detailed the process of the Dutch priest Ning Shoudao unreasonably tearing up the Three-Self Movement proclamation. Ning Shoudao had repeatedly forced Liang to stop promoting the Three-Self Movement to church members. When Liang Jundong reasoned with him, his attitude was rude and his words were rude, abusing divine power and oppressing church members. He also said: "I am a foreigner, Zhao Zhenya is Chinese, I don't listen to Zhao Zhenya." Liang Jundong said with indignation: "The imperialist elements insult us like this, we must resolutely fight against it."

After Liang Jundong's report, the participants were extremely angry at the illegal acts of Ning Shoudao and Wen Guibin in obstructing and sabotaging the Three-Self Reform Movement, and they condemned the crimes of imperialism in using Catholicism and oppressing the Chinese people. Liu Bocixiong, Hou Peijin, and Zhao Xuepo, the heads of Wanghailou Church, and Zhang Yushi, Nie Guoping, and Li Dongxu, members of the preparatory committee of the Reform Promotion Association Preparatory Committee, all revealed many crimes of foreign bishops and priests who oppressed Chinese Catholics at the meeting. All the participating priests and church member representatives expressed extreme indignation at the barbaric behavior of imperialist elements in sabotaging the patriotic reform movement of the Chinese religious circles, and decided to unite the Chinese Catholics in the city to resolutely oppose the illegal acts of Wen Guibin, Ning Shoudao and others.

At the forum, Wu Kezhai, a member of the Promotion Association Preparatory Committee, said: The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement has made many achievements. We Catholics have suffered all kinds of bullying from imperialism for many years, and today we are finally liberated. Everyone should be more united and continue to promote the Catholic Three-Self Movement. The meeting finally decided to send representatives to protest to Wen Guibin and decided not to allow foreign priests to have any illegal acts against Chinese patriotic Catholics and priests in carrying out the self-governing and self-supporting reform movement.

　　天津天主教人士集会
    向破坏自立革新运动的外籍主教提出抗议
    【新华社天津二十二日电】为进一步排除帝国主义分子的阻碍，开展自立革新运动，天津市天主教人士于二十日举行座谈会。出席的有天津市天主教革新运动促进会筹备会筹备委员吴克斋、张羽时、聂国屏等与天主教天津教区副主教赵振亚和神父回如愚、王思贤、李德培、李辅庭等及教友代表梁俊栋、刘伯慈等共六十六人。会上，三德里教堂教友梁俊栋控诉了该堂荷兰神父宁守道在法籍主教文贵宾指示之下，扯毁副主教赵振亚号召全市教徒响应自立革新运动的布告。
    赵振亚副主教说：天津市天主教的自立革新运动已有相当发展，但还有许多教友对自立革新运动的意义不了解或了解不深刻。今后全市神父应与促进会诸位团结一致，广泛展开宣传，并以进一步的实际行动把天主教的爱国革新运动推向前进。
    贺家口教堂神父张济众说：现在全国人民都已投身抗美援朝运动，天主教徒不能也不应袖手旁观。今后如何继续推进革新，应有进一步的行动表示。有几个教堂的一些外国神父还在企图阻挠革新运动，我们绝不容许！
    锦衣卫桥教堂神父刘品一说：中国人办中国教会是天经地义的事。有人说没有外国人的钱不行，这是可耻的说法。
    纪家庄教堂神父李德培、望海楼教堂神父杨让、小王庄教堂神父王洗耳都表示：天津天主教的自立革新运动是经过些周折的，但终于克服了困难，前进了一步。今后还应继续努力，警惕帝国主义分子的破坏阴谋。
    接着，三德里教堂教友梁俊栋在会上详细叙述了该堂荷兰神父宁守道无理撕毁三自运动布告的经过。宁守道曾几次强迫梁停止向教友宣传三自运动，梁俊栋与他论理时，他的态度蛮横，言词粗暴，滥用神权，压迫教友。并说：“我是外国人，赵振亚是中国人，我不听赵振亚的。”梁俊栋激忿地说：“帝国主义分子这样侮辱我们，我们要坚决和它作斗争。”
    梁俊栋报告后，与会者对宁守道和文贵宾这种阻挠和破坏三自革新运动的非法行为，引起了极大的愤怒，纷纷控诉帝国主义利用天主教和压迫中国人的罪恶。望海楼教堂会长刘伯慈、侯培金、赵雪坡，革新促进会筹备会筹备委员张羽时、聂国屏、李东序等都在会上揭发了许多外国主教、神父欺压中国教徒的罪行。全体与会神父及教友代表，对于帝国主义分子破坏中国宗教界爱国革新运动的横蛮行为，表示异常愤慨，决定团结全市中国教徒，坚决反对文贵宾、宁守道等不法行为。
    座谈会上，促进会筹备委员吴克斋说：天津天主教革新运动已有不少成绩。我们天主教徒好多年来受尽了帝国主义的欺负，今天才算解放。大家要加倍团结，继续推进天主教三自运动。会议最后决定推派代表向文贵宾提出抗议，决不容许外国神父有任何反对中国爱国教徒和神父开展自立革新运动的非法行为。
