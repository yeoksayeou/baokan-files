Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: The vast rural women in the Northeast region have participated in labor on a large scale, which has played a significant role in agricultural production. Last year, the direct participation of women in agricultural production was already quite common. Taking Jilin Province as an example, last year, more than 857,000 women participated in year-round agricultural production, accounting for 83 percent of the province's female labor force. According to statistics from ten counties in Rehe Province, there were more than 147,000 women in more than 22,000 mutual aid teams, some of whom also served as team leaders. Now, in 16 cities, counties, and banners in the province, more than 400,000 women can skillfully master a complete set of farming techniques such as plowing, sowing, fertilizing, weeding, and harvesting. State-owned mechanized farms in various places have trained more than 120 female tractor drivers.

The active participation of the vast number of women in agricultural production has enabled the surplus labor force in rural areas to engage in improving agricultural technology and carrying out sideline production. For example, in Chengjihao Village, Dunhua County, Jilin Province, since all the women in the village participated in production, a large number of male laborers were drawn out to reclaim wasteland, increasing the cultivated land by more than 240 mu. In Acheng County, Songjiang Province, 27,000 women participated in the autumn harvest last year, shortening the harvest period by ten days compared to previous years, so that they could quickly turn to winter sideline production.

After women in various places generally participated in agricultural production, it also made it possible for a large number of laborers to participate in industrial construction and national defense construction. In the first half of last year, 100,000 farmers in the entire region transferred to work in industrial and mining production departments. In the production movement in various places, female production models have also emerged continuously. For example, in the 29 cities and counties of Liaodong Province last year, there were 3,096 female agricultural labor models. According to statistics from six counties including Zhuanghe, women accounted for 17.9 percent of the 835 labor models. Three special model peasant women in the entire region were honorably selected as representatives to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th: Since liberation, through the anti-despot and rent reduction movement and land reform, a large number of working women in rural Henan Province have participated in the construction of people's political power at all levels. In the township-level political power of the thirteen counties in Xuchang Prefecture, there are more than 1,000 female cadres from peasant backgrounds, accounting for nearly one-third of the total number of members and chairpersons of the township political committees in the prefecture. According to statistics from Chenliu County, Chenliu Prefecture, in the first half of last year, more than 100 rural women served as members of district and township governments and chairpersons of township political committees. A considerable number of rural women representatives participated in the people's representative conferences at all levels convened by the people's governments and the peasant representative conferences, the highest organs of power in the districts and townships during the land reform period. At the first Henan Provincial People's Representative Conference, peasant woman Lu Zilan from Baofeng County and others were elected as members of the Henan Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee. These female cadres and representatives suffered greatly under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang and feudal landlords in the past. Therefore, in the rural anti-feudal struggle, they can work actively, closely contact the masses, and become the backbone of the peasant movement, and many people have won the glorious title of model cadre. For example, Li Guifang, the female township head of Dongyuan Township, Huangchuan, used rice straw to block the breach and stood on the straw with her feet when the Bailu River near the township flooded in May last year and a breach occurred in the embankment. Although the flood quickly flooded her waist, she was not afraid and waited until nearby farmers came to repair the breach before climbing up. There are more than 20 female model township heads recognized by the masses in Xuchang Prefecture, where land reform was completed earlier. Among them, Tang Zhiying of the Third District of Yuxian County has been promoted to deputy district head by the county people's government due to her active work and unanimous support from the local people.

Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 4th: Women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province actively participate in various construction tasks, and their political and economic status is gradually improving. According to incomplete statistics from last year, there are more than 500 women of various ethnic groups in the province serving as cadres at the district and county levels of the People's Government and being elected as representatives of people's representative conferences in various places. For example, the county head of Hejing County, Simouzhen, is a Mongolian woman. Currently, democratic women's federation organizations have been established in five of the province's ten special districts and 58 percent of the counties.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the People's Government, and the Democratic Women's Federation, women of all ethnic groups in various places actively participate in production and construction work. In the six special districts of Dihua City, Kashgar, Aksu, and Yili alone, more than 490,000 women of various ethnic groups participated in agricultural labor and organized more than 35,200 women to participate in groups for spinning and making hats to carry out household sideline production. The production income of the 769 women's production groups in the eight districts of Shufu County, Kashgar Prefecture alone, is equivalent to more than 110,000 jin of grain. In the province's water conservancy construction projects, more than 12,000 women of various ethnic groups in Dihua City participated in the construction of the Urumqi River dike. More than 10,000 women in Shache County also participated in the canal excavation project of the Yarkand River. In various production movements, many female labor models have emerged.

Women generally demand to learn culture. According to statistics from eight special districts in the province, 188,000 housewives have participated in literacy classes. The local cadre training classes held by the local CPC committees at various places have systematically absorbed women of various ethnic groups to participate in learning, and many of them have honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Among the more than 3,800 students studying in the Kashgar and Hotan local cadre training classes, one-third were female students.

Women of all ethnic groups in the province also take practical actions to participate in the patriotic movement to support the People's Liberation Army and resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. Two thousand women in Dihua City sewed tens of thousands of cotton-padded clothes for the troops stationed in Xinjiang of the People's Liberation Army. Women of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the city launched a donation campaign in response to the call of the Korean Democratic Women's League. Ayimu Khan, a Uyghur woman who makes a living by selling vegetables, also donated her day's vegetable sales income to help the Korean women in distress. In the congratulatory letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, women in various places firmly stated that they would actively participate in various constructions of the motherland to support the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers to achieve greater victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, 3rd: The vast number of Tibetan, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups in the Kangding Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province actively support the People's Liberation Army.

Last year, when the troops marching into Tibet passed through Kangding, women of all ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Hui, and Han, in the county chopped firewood and cut grass to provide timely fuel for the troops. Almost all Tibetan working women in the counties north of Kangding participated in the work of supporting the troops. Women in Ganzi County alone chopped firewood and cut grass for the troops, amounting to more than 5 million jin. Tibetan women in Ganzi, Dege, and other counties braved wind and rain, climbed over high mountains more than 4,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level, and passed through vast grasslands and many rapid rivers to transport a large number of military supplies and grain to the front lines in a timely manner.

Women in various counties in the Tibetan area also actively participated in road construction and road maintenance work. Tibetan women account for one-fifth of the road construction workers. They filled the frozen road surface on the Zeduo Mountain, where the air is thin and cold, clearing transportation obstacles for the troops. Tibetan women in Kangzhong Lihua and Baan (i.e., Batang) and other places assisted the engineers of a certain unit to transport wood from the high mountains thirty miles away, or to install explosives to blast rocks and open mountains.

In addition, women of all ethnic groups enthusiastically and automatically washed clothes and knitted socks for the troops. Last August, a unit of the People's Liberation Army accidentally lost hundreds of yaks in Dege County. Duoque Quda and her son, two Tibetan women in the area, automatically went out for six days and nights and found more than 30 yaks for the troops. Under their influence, the Tibetan people came out one after another and found all the lost yaks.

In the work of supporting the troops, a large number of model workers have emerged among women of all ethnic groups. In Kangding County alone, 22 people were selected. Their model deeds greatly encouraged the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

　　各地妇女努力参加国家建设
    东北广大农村妇女参加农业生产使大批农民转入工业和国防建设
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北区的农村妇女大批参加劳动，在农业生产上曾起了很大的作用。去年直接参加农业生产的妇女已经相当普遍。以吉林一省为例，去年参加全年农业生产的妇女即达八十五万七千余名，占全省妇女劳动力的百分之八十三。另据热河省十个县统计：在两万二千多个互助组内，即有妇女十四万七千多名，她们有的还担任了互助组长。现在该省在十六个市、县、旗中，已有四十余万妇女能够熟练地掌握扶犁、播种、施肥、锄草、收割等整套农作技术。各地的国营机械农场已培养了一百二十多名女拖拉机手。
    广大妇女的积极参加农业生产，使农村中的多余劳动力能够从事提高农业技术和进行副业生产。如吉林省敦化县成记号屯，自全屯妇女参加生产后，即抽出大批男劳动力进行开荒，增加了耕地二百四十多亩。松江省阿城县去年有两万七千名妇女参加了秋收，使秋收期较往年缩短了十天，得以迅速转入冬季副业生产。
    各地妇女普遍参加农业生产后，还使有大批劳动力参加工业建设和国防建设成为可能。去年上半年全区即有十万农民转入工矿生产部门工作。各地生产运动中，妇女生产模范亦不断涌现。如去年辽东省的二十九个市、县中即出现了妇女农业劳动模范三千零九十六名；据庄河等六县统计，在八百三十五名劳动模范中，妇女占百分之十七点九。全区并有三名特等模范农妇光荣地被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范大会的代表。
    河南大批劳动妇女参加政权工作许多妇女成为反封建斗争的骨干
    【新华社开封四日电】河南省农村自解放以来，经过反恶霸、减租运动和土地改革，已有大批劳动妇女参加各级人民政权的建设工作。许昌专区十三个县的乡级政权内，农民出身的妇女干部有一千多名，几占该专区乡政委员会委员、主席总数的三分之一。据陈留专区陈留县去年半年统计，担任区、乡政府委员和乡政委员会主席的农村妇女即达一百余人。各地人民政府召开的各界人民代表会和土地改革期间区、乡最高权力机关农民代表会内，都有相当数量的农村妇女代表参加。在河南省首届各界人民代表会上，宝丰县农妇卢子兰等被选为省各界人民代表会协商委员会委员。这些妇女干部和代表，过去在国民党和封建地主的残酷统治下，受尽苦难，因此，在农村反封建斗争中，都能积极工作密切联系群众，成为农民运动中的骨干，不少人获得了模范干部的光荣称号。如潢川东园乡女乡长李贵芳，在去年五月间该乡附近白露河洪水暴涨，堤岸发生漏洞时，她便用稻草堵住漏洞，双脚站在草上。虽然洪水很快漫过了她的腰，但她却毫不畏惧直等到附近农民赶来抢修，才爬了上来。在完成土地改革较早的许昌专区，被群众公认的女模范乡长共有二十多个，其中禹县三区的唐志英，由于工作积极，受到当地人民群众的一致拥护，已被该县人民政府提升为副区长。
    新疆各族妇女参加建设工作政治和经济地位都日渐提高
    【新华社迪化四日电】新疆省各民族妇女积极参加各项建设工作，她们的政治和经济地位日渐提高。据去年的不完全统计：全省共有五百多名各民族的妇女担任人民政府区、县级的干部和被选为各地人民代表会议的代表。如该省和靖县的县长西谋珍，就是蒙古族的妇女。现全省的十个专署中，已有五个专区和百分之五十八的县份建立了民主妇女联合会的组织。
    各地各民族的妇女，在中国共产党、人民政府和民主妇女联合会的领导下，积极参加生产建设工作。仅迪化市、喀什、阿克苏、伊犁等六个专区，即有四十九万多名各民族妇女参加农业劳动，并组织了三万五千二百多个妇女参加纺线、制帽等小组，进行家庭副业生产，仅喀什专区疏附县八个区的七百六十九个妇女生产小组的生产收入，即折合粮食达十一万余斤。在全省水利建设工程中，迪化市有一万二千多名各民族妇女参加了修筑乌鲁木齐河堤的工程。莎车县也有一万多妇女参加叶尔羌河的挖渠工程。在各项生产运动中，并涌现出许多妇女劳动模范。
    妇女们都普遍要求学习文化。据全省八个专区的统计：已有十八万八千名家庭妇女参加了识字班。各地中共党委会举办的地方干部训练班，曾有计划地吸收了各民族妇女参加学习，其中并有许多人光荣地参加了中国共产党。在喀什、和阗地方干部训练班学习的三千八百余名学员中，即有三分之一是妇女学员。
    该省各民族妇女并以实际行动，参加支援人民解放军和抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动。迪化市的两千名妇女，曾为人民解放军驻新疆的部队赶缝了数以万计的棉衣。该市各民族、各界妇女，为响应朝鲜民主妇女同盟的呼吁，展开了捐献运动。以卖菜为生的维吾尔族妇女阿衣木汗，也捐出她一天的卖菜所得，救济朝鲜的被难妇女。各地妇女在致中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的慰问信里都坚决表示：她们将以积极参加祖国的各项建设，支援中朝人民战士获得更大的胜利。
    康定藏区各族妇女支援进军西藏运粮筑路大大鼓舞了解放军战士
    【新华社雅安三日电】西康省康定藏族自治区的广大藏族、回族、汉族等各民族妇女，积极支援人民解放军。
    去年，进军西藏的部队途经康定时，该县藏族、回族、汉族各民族的妇女，纷纷砍柴、割草，及时供应了部队的燃料。康北各县的藏族劳动妇女，几乎全部参加了支援部队的工作。仅甘孜县的妇女就为部队砍柴、割草达五百余万斤。甘孜、德格等县的藏族妇女，曾冒着风雨，翻越拔海四、五千公尺以上的高山，通过了辽阔的草原和许多急湍的河流，将大批的军需品和粮食及时运到前线。
    藏区各县的妇女还积极地参加了修路护路的工作。在修路工人中，藏族妇女即占五分之一。她们在空气稀薄与寒冷的折多山上，填平冰冻的路面，为部队扫除运输上的障碍。康中理化、巴安（即巴塘）等地的藏族妇女，并协助某部工兵，到三十里外的高山上搬运木料，或装置炸药，炸石开山。
    此外，各民族妇女还热情地自动为部队洗衣服、织袜子等。去年八月解放军某部在德格县不慎走散犛牛数百头，该地藏族妇女度确曲达母子俩人，自动出去六昼夜，给部队找回犛牛三十余头。在他们的影响下，藏胞纷纷出动，将失散的犛牛全部找回。
    各民族妇女在各项支援部队的工作中，涌现出大批的工作模范。仅康定一县，就评选出二十二名。她们的模范事例，大大地鼓舞了解放军的战士们。
