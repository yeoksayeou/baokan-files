Discussing Learning Foreign Languages and Loving the Mother Tongue
—Starting with the Banning of Foreign Languages on Trademarks and Signboards
Xu Liqun

The Beijing Municipal People's Government issued a proclamation on March 15th, banning the use of foreign languages on trademarks and signboards. This is entirely worthy of support.

One of the imprints left in China by a hundred years of imperialist (especially Anglo-American imperialist) aggression is that, in certain administrative organs (such as customs and post offices) and certain industrial, commercial, and financial institutions, English has not only become "nobler" than Chinese but has even become the only "legal" language. Needless to say, those traitorous cliques of "diplomats" and comprador lackeys certainly believed that speaking English (and sometimes other foreign languages) was "nobler" than speaking Chinese, and the influence spread to the point where English was all over signboards and trademarks, and visible on newspaper headers and calendar days, truly "everywhere you look." In addition, it became a common phenomenon for many intellectuals to insert English into their speech. It is said that in the past, a certain medical college held faculty meetings entirely in English.

The use of foreign languages, or the insertion of English into speech, cannot be opposed indiscriminately. When necessary, it should be used. Certain nouns and terms for which there are no suitable translations at the moment can also include the original foreign words. As for some people who are just learning a foreign language and use a few foreign words out of novelty, that is also forgivable. The problem is: using foreign languages precisely when it is not necessary. Some of these people even believe that Chinese is both "rustic" and "vulgar" and not worth speaking; or they worship English, believing that "English has a stronger expressive power than Chinese, and English is more beautiful than Chinese." Naturally, there are also those who blindly follow the trend and do so to show off. Among these people, apart from the traitors and imperialist lackeys who have completely lost their Chinese character, and the ignorance of some people, at least they lack a sense of national self-respect and patriotism in this regard.

We advocate patriotism and also advocate loving our own language. Lenin wrote an article after the October Revolution called "On Cleansing the Russian Language." He severely criticized the unnecessary use of foreign languages. He called for a declaration of war on this phenomenon. We must learn from Lenin's spirit of loving his country's language. If one's own country's language is not perfect, then one should strive to make it more scientific, more complete, and more beautiful. Despising one's own country's language and worshiping foreign languages is a shameful manifestation of losing the spirit of patriotism.

Some people think we "oppose learning English." This is not correct. We firmly oppose Anglo-American imperialism, but English, seen as a tool, can be learned, and is sometimes necessary to learn. We also need to expand and deepen our friendship and cultural exchange with the people of the United States and Britain and other nations that use English. Why should we oppose learning English? Even for the sake of opposing Anglo-American imperialism, we still need to learn English. On the Korean front, isn't English still needed for shouting and persuading surrenders, and for doing prisoner work?

Some people, starting from a narrow nationalist viewpoint, and some people who are actually trying to find a counter-argument for their unpatriotic behavior, and even a few people who are deliberately provoking from a reactionary standpoint, ask: "Learning English is willingly accepting the cultural aggression of Anglo-American imperialism; isn't learning Russian willingly accepting the cultural aggression of the Soviet Union?"

It is obvious that this question is confused. First, we never simply believe that learning English is willingly accepting the influence of Anglo-American imperialist cultural aggression. Obviously, those who willingly accept the influence of Anglo-American imperialist cultural aggression are only those who are servile in the face of imperialism and regard themselves as slaves. The shamefulness and contemptibility of these people is because they have completely lost the national self-esteem of the Chinese people and the morality of being human, not because they are people who have learned English. Second, cultural aggression is one of the methods of imperialist aggression; in order to achieve the goal of aggression and enslavement of the people in colonies and semi-colonies, imperialism must adopt various methods of aggression, including military, economic, and cultural. What determines the essence of cultural aggression is the cannibalistic system and aggressive policies of imperialism, not their language. We firmly oppose Anglo-American imperialism and its aggressive policies, so we must also firmly oppose their cultural aggression as part of their aggression, and we must resolutely eliminate its influence. As for the Soviet Union, it is a socialist country and has no policy of aggression against others at all. How can there be any "cultural aggression" to speak of? Some people even ask if our distribution of the magazine "People's China" in the United States means that the Chinese people want to carry out "cultural aggression" against the United States. Isn't the ridiculousness of this question too obvious?

The socialist Soviet Union is the most advanced country in the world, with the most advanced ideology and culture, and has accumulated more than 30 years of experience in nation-building. In order to learn from the Soviet Union's experience more quickly and better to build a new China, it is absolutely necessary to learn Russian well and master this tool. On the issue of language, we should never compare whether Chinese and Russian are "rustic" or "vulgar," or whether Chinese has higher or lower expressive power than Russian, or which is more beautiful. If we take passages out of context and compare fragmented elements of the language, it cannot explain the problem. And to make a comprehensive comparison of two languages that both have a long history and are highly developed is fundamentally impossible, and therefore meaningless. In learning from the Soviet Union, we respect the brilliant culture of the Soviet Union and the great creativity of the Soviet people, and we also respect our own long history and the great creativity of the Chinese people. We learn Russian in order to better conduct cultural exchanges between brothers and friends. Learning Russian is for the convenience of learning the advanced experience and excellent culture of the Soviet people, and also for the convenience of introducing the excellent parts of our own culture to Soviet friends. The purpose of learning any other foreign language should also be like this. This attitude cannot be compared with the attitude of some slaves and traitors who learn English in order to better serve as slaves and lackeys.

From this it can be seen that, standing on the position of patriotism and internationalism, any foreign language, no matter which country's language it is, can be learned. However, after learning a foreign language, it should only be used when necessary and serve the purposes of patriotism and internationalism.

Foreign languages on trademarks and signboards should be banned because they are not necessary (only goods for export should use foreign languages). Therefore, the proclamation of the Beijing Municipal People's Government is worthy of support. The linguistic imprints imposed on us by the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism have been largely cleared away since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The phenomenon of using English instead of Chinese in places like customs, post offices, and Kailuan Coal Mine has been largely abolished. However, this imprint should be completely eradicated from all signboards and trademarks, from the mouths of all patriotic people, and from all occasions where English is not necessary. Therefore, we hope that the people of all regions will carry out the spirit of patriotism on this issue, in accordance with the spirit advocated by the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

　　谈学习外国语文和热爱祖国的语文
    ——从取缔商标招牌上的外国文字说起
    许立群
    三月十五日北京市人民政府出了布告，取缔商标和招牌使用外国文字。这是完全值得拥护的。
    一百年来帝国主义（尤其是美英帝国主义）对中国的侵略，留在中国的烙印之一，就是在某些行政机关（像海关、邮政）及某些工商业金融机构中，英文不仅成了比中文更“高贵”、甚至反而成了唯一“合法”的语文。不必说那些卖国集团的“外交家”和买办狗腿子们，他们固然认为说英文（有时还有其它外国语文）比说中文“高贵”，而且影响所及，英文遍布于招牌商标上，遍见于报纸的报眉和日历的曜目上，真所谓“触目皆是”。此外，许多知识分子说话时夹带英文，也成为常见的现象。听说以前某医学院开教务会议时是全部用英文进行讨论的。
    使用外国语文，或者讲话时夹用英文，不能无区别地加以反对。必要应用时，是应该应用的。某些名词术语，一时尚无适当的译名，也是可以夹用外国文的原字的。至于某些刚学外国语文的人为了新奇而夹用几个外国字，也还可原谅。问题是：并不是由于必要而偏偏使用了外国文。这些人有的竟认为中国语文既“土”且“俗”，不值得讲；或者崇拜英文，认为“英文表现力比中文强，英文比中文优美”。自然，也有糊里糊涂随波逐流，为了炫耀自己而这样做的。这些人当中，除了已经丧尽中国人气味的卖国贼和帝国主义走狗，以及某些人的某种无知以外，至少也是在这一点上缺少民族自尊的感觉，缺少爱国主义。
    我们提倡爱国，也提倡热爱自己的语文。列宁在十月革命后曾写了一篇文章，名叫《论清洗俄罗斯语言》。他严厉斥责了没有必要地使用外国文字。他号召要向这种现象宣战。我们要学习列宁热爱祖国语文的精神。自己祖国的语文如果不是完美无缺的，那就应该努力使它变得更科学、更完善、更优美。鄙视自己祖国的语言，崇拜外国语文，是丧失爱国主义精神的可耻现象。
    有人以为我们“反对学英文”了。这是不对的。我们坚决反对美英帝国主义，可是英文，被当做工具来看，是可以学，而且有时是必要学的。我们还需要扩大与加深我们和美英人民以及其它使用英语的各民族人民之间的友谊和文化交流。我们为什么反对学英文？即使说为了反对美英帝国主义，也还是要学英文的。在朝鲜前线为了喊话和劝降，为了做俘虏工作，不也还是需要英文么？
    也有人从狭隘的民族主义观点出发，也有人实际上是为自己不爱国的行为找反证，甚至也有个别的人是站在反动立场上故意进行挑拨，他们问：“学英文是甘心接受美英帝国主义的文化侵略；学俄文就不是甘心接受苏联的文化侵略么？”
    这个问题提得糊涂是显然的。第一，我们从来不简单地认为学英文就是甘心接受美英帝国主义文化侵略的影响。很显然，甘心接受美英帝国主义文化侵略的影响的，只是那些在帝国主义面前卑躬屈节、以奴仆自居的人。这些人之可耻可卑，是因为他们根本丧尽了中国人的民族自尊心和为人的道德，并不是因为他们是学了英文的人。第二，文化侵略是帝国主义侵略的方式之一；帝国主义为了达到侵略与奴役殖民地半殖民地人民的目的，就要采取军事的、经济的以及文化的各种侵略方式。决定文化侵略的本质的，是帝国主义的吃人制度和侵略政策，并不是决定于他们的文字。我们坚决反对美英帝国主义及其侵略政策，所以，对于它们作为侵略之一环的文化侵略，也必须坚决加以反对，必须坚决肃清其影响。至于苏联，它是社会主义国家，根本没有侵略旁人的政策，那里有什么“文化侵略”可言呢？有的人甚至问到我们把《人民中国》杂志拿到美国去发行，是否中国人民要向美国进行“文化侵略”。这个问题的可笑，不是太显明了吗？
    社会主义的苏联，是世界上最先进的国家，具有最先进的思想文化，积累了三十年以上的建国经验。为了更快和更好地学习苏联的经验来建设新中国，学好俄文，掌握这个工具是完全必要的。在语文问题上，我们决不应该去比较中文和俄文谁“土”谁“俗”，或者中文表现力比俄文谁高谁低，谁更优美。如果断章取义，割裂语文中的片断的因素加以比较，是不能说明问题的。而拿两个都有长久历史而且发展程度都很高的语文作全盘的比较，根本是不可能的，因而也就是无意义的了。在学习苏联的问题上，我们尊重苏联的灿烂文化和苏联人民的伟大创造力，我们也尊重自己悠久文明和中国人民的伟大创造力。我们学俄文是为了更好地进行兄弟朋友间的文化交流。学习俄文是为了既便于学习苏联人民的先进经验和优秀文化，也为了便于介绍自己文化的优秀部分给苏联友人。学习任何其它外国语文的目的，也应该是这样的。这种态度，和某些奴才卖国贼的学习英文是为了更好充当奴才走狗的态度，是不能相提并论的。
    由此可见，站在爱国主义与国际主义立场上，对于外国语文，不管是那一个国家的语文，都是可以学的。但是，学习了外国语文，只应该在必要时才使用它，并为爱国主义和国际主义的目的而服务。
    商标和招牌上的外国文字，是应该取缔的，因为它并无必要（只有运销国外的商品才应该使用外国文）。因此，北京市人民政府这个布告是值得拥护的。美英帝国主义的侵略所加在我们身上的在语文方面的烙印，从中华人民共和国成立以来，已经被清除了很多了，不论是海关、邮政，不论是开滦煤矿之类的地方，用英文代替中文的现象已经大量地被废止。可是，还应该从一切招牌商标上，从一切爱国人民的口边上，从一切不必要用英文的场合中，把这一烙印根本铲除干净。所以，我们希望各地人民都照着北京市人民政府所提倡的精神，在这个问题上，贯彻爱国主义的精神。
