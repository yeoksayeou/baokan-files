Review of "New Children's Heroes"
    Fang Yan

    This film, adapted from the novel "New Children's Heroes" by Yuan Jing and Kong Jue, powerfully reflects the moving anti-Japanese struggle of the people of central Hebei. The raging fire of the struggle is vividly displayed on the screen, allowing you to concretely feel a force that overwhelms mountains and topples seas. Our War of Resistance Against Japan was a great test, which eliminated the dregs of the nation and tempered vast numbers of outstanding sons and daughters, making them steel-like, staunch warriors. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they quickly raised their political consciousness, persisted in the struggle unyieldingly, until they achieved final victory. All of this is realistically and vividly depicted in this film.

    The film first exposes the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in bringing disaster to the country and the people. While hearing "The Lugouqiao cannons boom and echo," we see the ugly scenes of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit troops fleeing in disarray and looting along the way. Mixed in with the chaotic sound of horses' hooves are the cries of women who have been robbed. Landlords, bullies, bandits, and hooligans all organize armed forces, collude with the enemy puppets, and extort the residents. The kind residents, trapped in dire straits, can only vent their anger with curses and sighs.

    But soon after, "'The Red Army is here!' " That was General Lü Zhengcao's anti-Japanese troops. "'The 'Red Army' is different from those gangs that only eat and drink. They wear coarse cloth and eat millet; they fight the Japanese and love the people... This is a real army! If you want to fight the Japanese, join them!'" Thus, under the leadership of the local Communist Party member Hei Laocai, in the brutal struggle against the enemy, the masses were organized, the Party organization developed, and the people's armed forces were established. Struggle, struggle, and struggle until victory.

    The struggle against the enemy is the red thread running through the entire film, surrounded by fragments of the lives of local residents, and the complex struggle between progress and backwardness, revolution and counter-revolution. Yang Xiaomei's marriage incident is an important interlude reflecting the aspects of life and ideological conflicts. All of this not only adds flesh and blood to the entire film, but also gives political struggle and armed struggle a foundation and a living soil, strengthening the realism of the work. These ordinary sons and daughters each have their own life experiences, their own pains, demands, and hopes in the old society. In the face of a common enemy, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they embarked on the banner of the revolutionary struggle against Japan and local bullies from their respective life paths, through the development of their respective thoughts and emotions, and made earth-shattering achievements. This film vividly proves a great truth: the combination of Chairman Mao's and the Communist Party's leadership with the broad masses of the people is the source of the great power that can overcome any difficulty and defeat any strong enemy.

    The excellent qualities and tenacious fighting spirit of Communist Party members are powerfully expressed in the images of Hei Laocai, Niu Dashui, and others. On the battlefield and in the execution ground, they similarly despise and scorn the enemy, demonstrating the steadfastness and purity of Party members with exemplary heroism. Strictly speaking, the personalities of the general characters are not prominent enough, and the individuality is not distinct enough, but the efforts of the writers, directors, and actors have already achieved great results. The scene of Li Da Niang taking in Yang Xiaomei is particularly moving. She wanted to take her in, but she was afraid to take her in, and finally she took in Yang Xiaomei. The development of Li Da Niang's contradictory psychology profoundly reflects the sharpness and cruelty of the struggle, the terror caused by the enemy's frenzied burning and killing atrocities, and also fully demonstrates the masses' highest degree of love for revolutionary cadres. The kneeling action of Yang Xiaomei, as a revolutionary female cadre, is unnecessary, and this is a flaw in this moving scene.

    If this excellent film has any major shortcomings, it is that after the enemy's "Great Sweep," it does not directly depict the battles and development of the troops led by Hei Laocai, but only focuses on depicting the individual struggles of Niu Dashui and Yang Xiaomei, so that the audience cannot see how this troop persisted, which detracts from the integrity of the work. And Yang Xiaomei's rescue after being injured while crossing the river also seems somewhat accidental. In the novel, Hei Laocai is hidden among the masses near the densely distributed enemy outposts, leading the masses to carry out the anti-blockade struggle. This scene should also appear on the screen to give the film a more magnificent atmosphere, and Hei Laocai's personality and his flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses would also have the opportunity to be expressed more vividly and powerfully.

    In any case, "New Children's Heroes" is a film worth recommending, as it specifically illustrates the great progress of New China's film art. Showing this film today will undoubtedly be welcomed by the broad audience and achieve the due educational effect.

    (Editor's Note: This film will be shown on the first day (the 8th of this month) of the State-owned Film Studio's New Film Exhibition Month.)

　　《新儿女英雄传》评介
    方岩
    这部影片是根据袁静、孔厥的小说《新儿女英雄传》改编的，有力地反映了冀中人民的可歌可泣的抗日斗争。斗争的烈火集中地表现在银幕上，使你具体感觉到一种排山倒海的力量。我们的抗日战争是一种伟大的考验，它淘汰了民族的败类，锻炼了广大的优秀儿女，使他们成为钢铁一样坚强的战士。他们在共产党的领导下很快地提高政治觉悟，宁死不屈地坚持斗争，直到获得最后的胜利。这一切在这部影片里获得了真实、生动的表现。
    影片首先暴露了国民党反动派祸国殃民的罪行。在听到《芦沟桥的炮声咚咚响》的同时，我们看到国民党反动派匪军狼狈逃窜、沿途抢劫的丑恶场面。在混乱的马蹄声中，夹杂着遭劫的妇女的哭声。地主、恶霸、土匪、流氓，纷纷组织武装队伍，勾结敌伪，敲榨居民。陷在水深火热中的善良居民无可奈何，只能用咀咒和叹息来发泄自己的愤怒。
    可是不久之后，《红军来啦！》那是吕正操将军的抗日队伍。“‘红军’跟这些吃喝队可不一样，穿的粗布，吃的小米；打日本，爱百姓……。这才是正式军队呢！要想打日本，参加这个去！”于是在当地共产党员黑老蔡的领导下，在残酷的对敌斗争中，群众组织起来了，党的组织发展了，人民武装建立起来了。斗争，斗争，一直斗争到胜利。
    对敌斗争是贯串全部影片的红线，围绕着它的是当地居民的生活断片，是进步与落后的、革命与反革命的复杂斗争。杨小梅的婚姻事件是映现生活面貌和思想冲突的重要穿插。这一切不但增加了全部影片的血肉，而且使政治斗争、武装斗争有了根柢，有了生活的土壤，加强了作品的真实感。这些平凡的儿女们在旧社会中各有各的生活体验，各有各的痛苦、要求和希望。他们在共同敌人面前，在共产党的领导下，从各自生活的道路，通过各自思想情绪的发展，奔赴抗日反霸的革命斗争的大旗，做出了惊天动地的事迹。这部影片生动地证明了一个伟大的真理：毛主席、共产党的领导和广大人民的结合，就是能够克服任何困难、战胜任何强敌的伟大力量的泉源。
    共产党员的优良品质和顽强的战斗精神，在黑老蔡、牛大水等形象上获得了有力的表现。在战场上，在刑场上，他们同样藐视、鄙视敌人，以模范的英雄气概来表现党员的坚贞和纯洁。严格说来，一般人物的性格还不够凸出，个性还不够鲜明，但编导者和演员们的努力已经取得了巨大的收获。李大娘收留杨小梅的场面是特别感动人的，她想收留，又不敢收留，而终于收留了杨小梅。李大娘这种矛盾心理的发展，深刻地反映了斗争的尖锐和残酷，反映了敌人疯狂的烧杀暴行所造成的恐怖，也充分表现了群众对革命干部的最高度的热爱。作为革命女干部的杨小梅下跪的动作是不必要的，这是这一动人场面的一个缺点。
    如果说这部优秀的影片有什么主要的缺点，那就是在敌人“大扫荡”之后，没有正面描写黑老蔡所领导的部队的战斗和发展，而仅仅着重描写牛大水和杨小梅的个别斗争经过，使观众看不见这支部队是怎样坚持过来的，减损了作品的完整性。而杨小梅过河受伤后的遇救，也显得有些偶然了。在小说里，黑老蔡隐蔽在星罗棋布的敌人岗楼附近的群众里，领导群众进行反封锁的斗争。这种场面也应该在银幕上出现，使影片增加雄伟的气魄，而黑老蔡的性格和他跟群众的血肉关系，也有机会得到更鲜明有力的表现。
    无论如何，《新儿女英雄传》是一部值得推荐的影片，它具体说明了新中国电影艺术的巨大进步。这部片子在今天放映，无疑将获得广大观众的欢迎，取得应有的教育效果。
    （编者按：这部影片将在国营电影厂出品新片展览月第一天（本月八日）放映。）
