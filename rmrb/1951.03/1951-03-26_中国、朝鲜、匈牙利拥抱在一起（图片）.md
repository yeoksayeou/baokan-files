    They sat around in the snow, Old Jin softly singing the "General Kim Il-sung Song," and Wang Huaiduo also learned a few lines.
    (14) Just then, two enemy planes flying extremely low swooped down from the other side of the mountain. Immediately, a fierce gust of wind blew away the camouflage on the truck. "Lie down quickly!" Wang Huaiduo ordered everyone, worried only about the medicine hidden in the ground.
