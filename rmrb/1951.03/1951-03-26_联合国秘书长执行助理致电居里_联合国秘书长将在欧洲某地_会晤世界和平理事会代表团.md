　　联合国秘书长执行助理致电居里
    联合国秘书长将在欧洲某地
    会晤世界和平理事会代表团
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：今晚报二十四日报道：联合国秘书长执行助理柯尔第耶顷致电世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里称：“秘书长希望在他预定不久即将出发的旅行中，在欧洲某地，可能是在巴黎、日内瓦或罗马，与阁下的代表团会晤。我当在最近再就会晤地点与日期问题与阁下联系。”
    按：约里奥—居里教授曾于三月八日按照世界和平理事会第一届会议的决议，致函联合国秘书长，要求他接见世界和平理事会的代表团。该代表团将向联合国要求：（一）考虑世界和平大会“致联合国书”中的各项建议以及世界和平理事会第一届会议上通过的各项决议，并逐项表示意见；（二）恢复执行联合国宪章所规定的任务，就是说联合国应当作为各国政府之间取得协议的场所，而不应作为任何居统治地位的集团的工具。
