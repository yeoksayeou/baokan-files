　　National Forestry Conference Concludes
　　Determining This Year's Work Guidelines and Tasks
　　[Xinhua News Agency] The 1951 National Forestry Conference concluded on the 24th of this month. The conference lasted eleven days. During the meeting, representatives from various regions extensively exchanged views on issues such as forest protection, "closing hillsides for afforestation," afforestation, and the rational felling and utilization of forests. They also discussed draft regulations related to the above issues and preliminarily determined the guiding principles and tasks for national forestry work in 1951. Minister of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government, Liang Xi, gave a concluding speech at the end of the conference.

　　In his summary, Minister Liang pointed out that because China's forests had suffered long-term destruction and plunder by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits in the past, they urgently needed to be restored in order to reduce the natural disasters suffered by the vast farmlands across the country and to fully supply the timber needed for national construction. Although various regions achieved certain results in afforestation work last year, incidents of forest destruction still existed seriously, especially the losses caused by forest fires, which were very large. Therefore, all regions must strengthen forest protection work this year. Experience from last year has proven that "closing hillsides for afforestation" is not only the most effective for protecting forests and mountains, but also warmly welcomed by the masses in mountainous areas. This year, it should be vigorously promoted in key areas.

　　Regarding afforestation work, Minister Liang pointed out that cooperative afforestation is the main direction of afforestation work in the future. The focus of afforestation this year is to create water source forests and riverbank protection forests in the upper reaches of the Huai River, Yellow River, Yongding River, Liao River, and other severely flooded river mountain areas and along the riverbanks to conserve water and soil and reduce floods. In areas severely affected by wind and sand erosion, windbreak and sand-fixing forests should be built.

　　In order to avoid deforestation in newly liberated areas and to ensure a continuous supply of timber, Minister Liang requested that all possible efforts be made this year to implement the policy of rational felling and rational use of timber, and to do a good job in the unified allocation of timber, striving to actively supply timber for public and private use. At the very least, all regions should ensure that forestry agencies manage forest felling work or unified felling, and avoid disorganized timber rush purchases and contractor logging. The amount and use of timber felling should also be based on the existing tree conditions in the forest, "take what is available, fell what is available," and "use what is available," opposing the bias of only felling good timber and not felling inferior timber, or only using good timber and not using inferior timber.

　　Finally, Minister Liang pointed out that in order to strengthen the organizational leadership of forestry work, all regions will systematically cultivate a large number of grassroots forestry cadres this year.

　　全国林业会议闭幕
    确定今年工作方针和任务
    【新华社讯】一九五一年全国林业会议已于二十四日闭幕。会议共历时十一日。会议中各地代表对护林、“封山育林”、造林及森林的合理采伐与合理利用等问题曾经广泛交换意见，并讨论了有关上述问题的条例草案，初步确定了一九五一年全国林业工作的方针和任务。会议最后由中央人民政府林垦部梁希部长作总结。
    梁部长在总结中指出：由于我国森林过去曾长期遭受日寇和国民党匪帮的破坏掠夺，因此亟待加以恢复，以减少全国广大农田所受的天然灾害，和充分供应全国建设需用的木材。去年各地虽在造林工作上有一定的成绩，但森林被破坏的事件仍然严重存在，特别是森林火灾造成的损失很大。因此，今年各地必须加强护林工作。从去年的经验证明：“封山育林”不仅对护林、护山最为有效，更为山区群众热烈欢迎，今年应当选择重点地区大力推行。
    在造林工作方面，梁部长指出：合作造林是今后造林工作的主要方向。今年造林的重点，是在淮河、黄河、永定河、辽河及其他泛滥较严重的河流上游山地及沿河两岸营造水源林和护岸林，以保持水土，减少水患；在受风沙侵袭严重的地区，应营造防风林和防沙林。
    为了避免新解放地区的森林被滥伐，和保证林木的源源供应，梁部长要求在今年应尽一切可能贯彻合理采伐和合理使用木材的方针，并作好木材的统一调配工作，力求作到主动地供应公私用材。各地至少应作到由林业机关管理森林的采伐工作或统一采伐，切忌无组织的抢购木材和包商伐木。对木材的采伐量和使用方面，也应按照森林的现有树木情况，“有什么，采什么”和“有什么，用什么”，反对只采良材，不采次材，或只用良材，不用次材等偏向。
    最后梁部长指出：为了加强林业工作的组织领导，今年各地区都将有计划地大量培育林业基层干部。
