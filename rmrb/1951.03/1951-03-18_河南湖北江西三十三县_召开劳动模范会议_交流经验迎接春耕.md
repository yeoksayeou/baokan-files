　　Thirty-three Counties in Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Hold Labor Model Conferences
    Exchange Experiences and Prepare for Spring Plowing

    Recently, thirty-three counties including Jia County in Henan, Xishui in Hubei, and Le'an in Jiangxi have successively held agricultural labor model conferences to welcome the upcoming spring plowing. The number of labor models attending each county ranged from a minimum of ninety to a maximum of two hundred and eighty-five. Among them were many special-class labor models who had achieved outstanding results in agricultural production last year. For example, Xie Kaishan, a special-class labor model in Xishui County, Hubei Province, organized nine poor peasant households into a mutual aid team last year, increasing rice production by 2,500 *jin*, cotton by 130 *jin*, and cane sugar by more than 1,100 *jin*. Under his influence and promotion, twenty mutual aid teams were developed in the whole village, ensuring that the whole village completed the agricultural production increase task. The buckwheat planted by Xie Kaishan himself yielded twice as much as others.

    At the labor model conferences in various counties, the production achievements and shortcomings of the past year were generally summarized, this year's production plans were discussed and formulated, and production experiences were exchanged through group discussions and typical reports. At the same time, the labor model conferences in various counties also discussed current affairs. The participating labor models unanimously expressed their determination to do a good job in the land reform, suppress counter-revolutionaries, step up production, and carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea. In addition, the conferences in various places wrote letters to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to achieve greater success in agricultural production this year.

    When the labor model conferences in various places ended, the attending labor models were awarded banners, medals, certificates, and prizes such as plough cattle, donkeys, farm tools, clothes, shoes, and socks by the local people's governments. Each of the nine special-class labor models in Xishui County was awarded a plough cattle. The labor models who attended the conferences in various places had a great impact after returning to their villages. Through their publicity and promotion, the masses are very active in production, and a movement to strive to become labor models has been launched in various places.

　　河南湖北江西三十三县召开劳动模范会议
    交流经验迎接春耕
    河南郏县、湖北浠水、江西乐平等三十三县。最近曾先后召开了农业劳动模范会议，迎接即将到来的春耕。各县出席的劳动范模最少有九十名最多达二百八十五名。其中有不少特等劳动模范曾在去年农业生产中创造了杰出的成绩。如湖北浠水县特等劳动模范谢开善，去年组织九户贫农成为一换工互助组，增产稻谷二十五市担，棉花一百三十斤，蔗糖一千一百余斤。在他的影响和推动下，全村发展了二十个换工互助小组，保证了全村完成农业增产任务。谢开善自己种的荞麦，产量超过别人二倍。
    各县的劳动模范会上，普遍总结了去年的生产成绩和缺点，讨论和制订了今年的生产计划，并且通过小组座谈、典型报告等方式交流了生产经验。同时，各县劳动模范会议又都讨论了时事问题。与会劳动模范们一致表示决心搞好土地改革工作、镇压反革命分子，加紧生产和开展抗美援朝运动。此外各地会议更纷纷给毛主席写信，保证今年在农业生产中取得更大的成绩。
    当各地劳动模范会议结束时，出席的劳动模范都分别得到当地人民政府奖给的锦旗、奖章、奖状和耕牛、驴、农具、衣服、鞋袜等奖品。浠水县九名特等劳动模范每人获奖耕牛一头。各地与会劳动模范回村后，影响很大，经过他们的宣传和推动，群众生产很积极，争取做劳动模范的运动已在各地展开。
