Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Tass, Paris, 4th: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party adopted a resolution on the 2nd, welcoming the resolutions of the World Peace Council. The Political Bureau emphasized that the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France—points out a path for all countries to avoid a new catastrophe. The resolution calls on party organizations to make every effort to quickly make the broad masses aware of this declaration, thereby carrying out extensive activities for peace and struggling to convene a five-power representative conference that would help ease international tensions.

The Political Bureau emphasized that under the war policy pursued by the Pleven government, the cost of living has risen sharply, wages have been frozen, the prices of industrial and agricultural products are out of balance, taxes have increased, and the situation of the elderly and the poor is deteriorating, while the demands of veterans and former prisoners of war are rejected. However, huge sums of money are spent to continue the Vietnam War and prepare for military gambles in Europe.

The Political Bureau calls on French men and women to unite and expose election conspiracies everywhere, and to demand elections based on proportional representation; it calls on working people to establish action committees in enterprises, institutions, cities, and villages to ensure universal suffrage. The Political Bureau points out that at a time when the cabinet is in crisis, and American party members from Socialist Party leaders to the Gaullists are plotting to establish a more reactionary government to intensify their traitorous policies, the broad masses should use vigorous activities to show the warmongers that the French people are determined to destroy these evil plans and pave the way for the establishment of a true French government.

The Political Bureau believes that the agreement of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to hold a preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers is a victory for Soviet policy; the Political Bureau calls on party activists to actively participate in the national referendum against the rearmament of West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Tass, Prague, 4th: The International Student Union passed a resolution, enthusiastically supporting the declarations and resolutions of the World Peace Council, stating: "The various historic resolutions of the World Peace Council are new steps to prevent another world war. The International Student Union supports the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and calls on all honest students around the world who are fighting to maintain peace, regardless of religion or political belief, to unanimously sign this declaration, widely publicize it, and immediately implement the various resolutions of the World Peace Council."

　　法共政治局号召全党发动广大群众
    努力争取缔结五大国和平公约
    国际学联拥护世界和平理事会的决议
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社巴黎四日讯：法国共产党政治局于二日通过决议，欢迎世界和平理事会的决议。政治局着重指出：关于缔结美、苏、中、英、法五大国和平公约的宣言，向各国指出了一条使世界免于新浩劫的道路。决议号召党组织尽一切努力迅速使广大群众认识这个宣言，从而为和平而进行广泛的活动，为争取召开有助于缓和国际紧张局势的五大国代表会议而斗争。
    政治局强调指出：在普利文政府所奉行的战争政策下，生活费用高涨，工资被冻结，工业品和农产品价格失去平衡，赋税增加，老年人和贫苦者的境遇每况愈下，退伍军人和前战俘的要求被拒绝。但是为了继续进行越南战争和准备欧洲的军事赌博，却不惜花费巨资。
    政治局号召法国男女一致起来揭穿各地的选举阴谋，并要求按照比例代表制进行选举；号召劳动人民在企业、机关、城市和乡村中成立行动委员会以保障普遍参政权。政治局指明：当此内阁发生危机，从社会党领袖到戴高乐派各美国党分子正在策划成立一个更反动的政府来加紧他们的卖国政策的时候，广大群众应以强有力的活动向战争贩子们表明：法国人民决心要摧毁这些罪恶的计划，并为成立一个真正的法兰西政府而开辟道路。
    政治局认为苏、美、英、法同意召开四国外长预备会议是苏联政策的胜利；政治局号召党的积极分子积极参加反对重新武装西德的全民公决。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社布拉格四日讯：国际学生联合会通过决议，热烈拥护世界和平理事会的宣言和决议称：“世界和平理事会的各项历史性决议，是防止另一次世界大战的新步骤。国际学联支持世界和平理事会关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言，号召全世界一切为维护和平而奋斗的正直学生，不分宗教和政治信仰，一致在这个宣言上签名，广泛宣传并立即执行世界和平理事会的各项决议。”
