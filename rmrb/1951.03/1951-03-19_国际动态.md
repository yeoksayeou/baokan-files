    Togliatti Returns to Rome from Moscow
    Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti, who went to the Soviet Union on December 17 last year for recuperation from a brain ailment, has recovered his health and returned to Rome from Moscow on February 26 this year, continuing to lead the work of the Italian Communist Party.
  Chairman Ruegger of the International Committee of the Swiss Red Cross Arrives in Beijing
    Chairman Ruegger of the International Committee of the Swiss Red Cross, accompanied by his wife, private advisor Esch, and the committee's medical director Marti, arrived in Beijing from Switzerland on the morning of the 14th at around 6:00 AM for a general courtesy visit.
  Korean Government Vigorously Restores Educational Institutions
    The American aggressors have destroyed all schools and research institutes throughout Korea. The Ministry of Education of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is taking measures to restore educational institutions. Seventy-six normal schools are being opened simultaneously in various provinces, major cities, and regions to train 3,000 teachers for primary schools and 1,500 teachers for secondary schools. The Normal School Research Institute in Sinuiju, restored by the people's efforts, has already reopened.
  70,000 Woolen Workers in the United States Continue Strike
    Despite the U.S. Army authorities' threatening conscription orders, 70,000 woolen workers in 160 factories in the United States continue their strike demanding increased wages and improved working conditions, refusing to return to factories to produce woolens for the war. The strike of 200,000 cotton mill workers is scheduled to begin on the 15th. The cotton mill workers are demanding a 12 percent wage increase.
  Women and Children in the Iranian Capital Hold Peaceful Demonstration
    Ten thousand women and children in Tehran, the capital of Iran, held a peaceful demonstration on the 9th. The demonstrators and the crowded onlookers along the way shouted slogans such as "Peace!" "Down with the war instigators!" "Long live the freedom of the Korean people!" "Long live the women's democratic movement!"
  Queuille Reluctantly Forms New French Cabinet
    Since the French Pleven government collapsed on February 28 due to the French ruling clique's unequal "division of spoils" on the issue of so-called electoral law amendments, radical socialist politician Queuille was commissioned for the second time and reluctantly formed a "new" government on the 10th. In addition to Queuille as Prime Minister, the "new" government added three Deputy Prime Ministers, Pleven, Bidault, and Moch, while the other cabinet members remained the same as the Pleven government, unchanged.
  Morrison Succeeds Bevin as British Foreign Secretary
    The British government announced on the 9th that Foreign Secretary Bevin had resigned and appointed the current Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council, Morrison, to succeed him. Like Bevin, Morrison is also one of the right-wing leaders of the British Labour Party. Bevin, after resigning as Foreign Secretary, is now the Lord Privy Seal.
  Turkish Government Resigns
    Amid the government crises occurring everywhere in European capitalist countries, the Turkish government also resigned on March 9. The reason is that Prime Minister Menderes' consistent pursuit of a war policy following the United States has caused serious divisions within his own "Democratic Party." Before the general resignation of the Menderes government, several ministers had already resigned in opposition to Menderes' policies.
