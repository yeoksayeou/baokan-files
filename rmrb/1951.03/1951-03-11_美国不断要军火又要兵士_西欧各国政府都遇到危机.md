　　The United States Constantly Demands Military Supplies and Soldiers
    Western European Governments All Encounter Crises

    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The Telegraph Agency recently commented on the current plight of the puppet regimes of US imperialism in Western Europe, stating: The French government has resigned. The Italian government may also resign. The Netherlands has been without a formal government for weeks. Belgium has not yet quelled the aftermath of the "royal dispute." The British Labour government is maintained by a slender majority in Parliament, which may be lost due to some event. Such is the state of the ruling cliques in Western European countries under US control today.

    Eisenhower, the overlord of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, numerous American generals, and Harold, the American director of Western European war production, have recently visited Western Europe one after another to carry out various activities. However, these activities have not only failed to stabilize the position of America's puppets, but have instead subjected them to increasingly fierce opposition. Britain's Attlee, France's Pleven, Italy's De Gasperi, the Netherlands' Drees, and others are now encountering government crises. Regardless of the surface issues, these crises are all caused by the United States' continuous demands for military supplies and soldiers. These individuals are themselves docile servants, but the master they serve makes it difficult for them to live.

    With the exception of the small country of Luxembourg, no other Western European country has a stable government. Even those so-called "reliable ones" do not trust themselves. West German puppet Chancellor Adenauer dares not respond to invitations to discuss the issue of German reunification, and Nazi General Guderian would rather take his army across the Pyrenees. In fascist Spain, the Franco government dared not announce the route that the new US Ambassador Griffis would take to Franco's palace, and had to send troops to escort him all the way.

    The Telegraph Agency concluded: Western Europe has two paths to take: one is to use American military supplies and become fascistized under American servitude and enslavement; the other is to establish peace and friendly mutual assistance with the whole world. The people of Europe have already chosen the second path; it is they who are shaking the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

### 美国不断要军火又要兵士  西欧各国政府都遇到危机

　　美国不断要军火又要兵士
    西欧各国政府都遇到危机
    【新华社十日讯】电通社最近评述美帝国主义在西欧各国的奴仆们目前的处境称：法国政府辞职了。意大利政府也有辞职的可能。荷兰到现在已经好几个星期没有正式政府了。比利时还没有平息“王位纠纷”的余波。英国工党政府维系于议会中微弱的多数，而这种多数是可能因为某种事件而丧失的。今天美国控制下的西欧各国统治集团的景况就是如此。
    北大西洋公约的主宰艾森豪威尔、美国的许多将领和美国的西欧战争生产总管赫罗德，最近都纷纷来到西欧，进行各种活动。但是，这些活动不但没有稳定美国的奴仆们的地位，反而使他们遭到愈来愈厉害的反对。英国的艾德礼，法国的普利文，意大利的加斯贝利，荷兰的德理斯等人，现在都遭遇到政府危机。这种危机，不论其表面问题如何，都是美国继续不断地要求军火和兵士所引起的。这些人本身都是驯服的仆从，但他们所侍奉的主人却使他们不容易过日子。
    除了弹丸小国卢森堡以外，西欧各国中就再没有一个国家有着稳固的政府。甚至所谓“可靠者”也不信任自己了。西德傀儡总理阿登纳竟不敢答复讨论德国统一问题的邀请，纳粹将领古德林宁愿把他的军队带过比利牛斯山去。在法西斯的西班牙，佛朗哥政府没有敢把新任美国大使葛里费斯赴佛朗哥宫所将经过的路线宣布，而且还得派兵一路护卫他去。
    电通社最后指出：西欧有两条路可走：一条是用美国军火，在美国驯服奴役下法西斯化；另一条就是与全世界建立和平与友好互助。欧洲人民已经选择了第二条道路；震撼北大西洋侵略集团的，正就是他们。
