　　The level of understanding of the campaign to resist America and aid Korea among the masses in this large courtyard is by no means an isolated or rare example, but represents a segment of the urban population. Therefore, I have a few suggestions regarding the propaganda and education work of the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea:

　　First, in order to further popularize and deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, appropriate attention should be paid to the unorganized masses in the future. Taking the 7th District of Beijing as an example, the organized masses have received more education in the campaign to resist America and aid Korea; however, the unorganized masses have received very little education. Taking this large courtyard as an example: Liu Qilong, a fifth-grade student in elementary school, can explain the reasons for resisting America and aiding Korea very well; the rickshaw pullers have a relatively good understanding of the campaign to resist America and aid Korea; but the understanding of those engaged in petty trading and housewives is very poor. Of course, it is right to first conduct propaganda and education among the organized masses, and it is difficult to conduct propaganda and education among the unorganized masses; however, if we want to educate every person in China in patriotism, we must solve this problem.

　　Second, we should be good at conducting propaganda and education among the masses through activists. The residents of this large courtyard are all very busy with their work. They rarely have time to attend meetings or listen to reports. Much of what they know is passed on by the residents to each other. Therefore, it is a more effective method for activists they are familiar with to regularly conduct propaganda and education on the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea for them. It is understood that there are more than 450 members of the sub-committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression in the 7th District, district and street representatives, and activists in other mass organizations. If they are given timely assistance to promote them to conduct systematic propaganda among the masses, their role will be significant.

　　Third, the content of propaganda should be combined with the lives of the masses, and the forms of propaganda should be popular with the masses, so that it is easily accepted by the masses and can improve the masses' perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. The residents of this large courtyard are more receptive to propaganda such as plays, songs, and cartoons. They say: We saw the big bad guys Truman, MacArthur, and Syngman Rhee in the play, and we understood this reason. The rickshaw pullers learned the song "Truman, You Big Bad Guy" and liked to sing it very much. On the other hand, the rickshaw puller Wang Wenliang expressed no interest in union meetings because: "During the meeting, the cadres gave a speech on the stage, and finally raised their arms and shouted: 'The power of the people is great, we will surely win.' We don't understand, and they don't care." But on the other hand, if the masses' perceptual knowledge is not improved to rational knowledge, their ideological problems cannot be completely solved. For example, the rickshaw pullers know that America is bad, but the reasons are only "in the past, American devils got drunk, took rickshaws without paying, and beat people" and "American trucks ran over people and didn't care." They know less about the facts of American aggression against China in history and now. Therefore, their hatred of the United States is not deep, and they feel that "America is better than Japan."

　　Fourth, propaganda and education work on the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea should be carried out continuously in conjunction with the central work of each period. The residents of the large courtyard have more or less knowledge of the campaign to resist America and aid Korea, but they know even less or nothing about the US plot to conclude a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan. Even Qian Shun, a district representative of the 7th District who lives near the large courtyard, felt "unable to say" about the US rearming Japan. This is a problem worth noting.

　　These opinions are only based on the situation in the back door courtyard of No. 10, Er Tiao, Wofosi, 7th District, and may not be comprehensive. I hope you will publish these opinions to attract everyone's attention and make the campaign to resist America and aid Korea more popular and deeper.

### 抗美援朝的宣传应该深入到无组织的群众中去

　　抗美援朝的宣传应该深入到无组织的群众中去
    这个大杂院的群众对抗美援朝的认识程度，绝不是个别的稀有的例子，而是代表着一部分市民群众的。因此，我对抗美援朝爱国运动的宣传教育工作有几点意见：
    一、为了更加普及与深入抗美援朝爱国运动，今后对无组织的群众应该加以适当的注意。以北京市第七区来说，有组织的群众在抗美援朝运动中所受的教育是较多的；但无组织的群众所受教育则很少。以这个大杂院来说：小学五年级的学生刘启龙对为什么要抗美援朝能够说得头头是道；三轮车工人们对抗美援朝运动的认识还比较好；而做小买卖的、家庭妇女等的认识就很差。当然，首先对有组织的群众进行宣传教育是对的，向无组织的群众进行宣传教育是有困难的；但是，我们要使全中国每一个人受到爱国主义的教育，就必须解决这个问题。
    二、应该善于通过群众中的积极分子向群众进行宣传教育。这个大杂院的居民，工作都很忙。他们很少有时间参加会议或听报告。他们所知道的事情很多是居民们互相传述的。因此，由他们熟悉的积极分子经常向他们进行抗美援朝爱国运动的宣传教育是一个比较有效的方法。据了解，第七区中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会委员，区、街代表及其他群众组织中的积极分子，共有四百五十人以上。如果给他们及时的帮助，推动他们向群众作系统地宣传，其作用是很大的。
    三、宣传内容应与群众生活相结合，宣传形式应为群众所喜闻乐见，这样才容易为群众所接受，才能使群众感性认识向理性认识提高一步。这个大杂院的居民们对演剧、唱歌、漫画等宣传比较能接受。他们说：我们在戏里看见了杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、李承晚几个大坏蛋，我们就知道了这个理儿。三轮车工人们学了《杜鲁门，你这大坏蛋》的歌子，就很喜欢唱。而三轮车工人王文亮对工会开会则表示不感兴趣，因为：“开会时，干部们在台上讲了一遍，最后举起胳膊喊：‘人民力量大，我们一定胜利。’我们不懂他们也不管。”但另一方面，如果不把群众感性的认识向理性的认识提高一步，是不能完全解决他们的思想问题的。如三轮车工人们知道美国坏，但理由却只是“过去美国鬼子喝醉了酒，坐车不给钱，还打人”和“美国卡车碾死人不管”。而对美国历史上和现在侵略中国的事实知道较少。因此，他们对美国的仇恨就不深，感到“美国比日本还好些”。
    四、应该结合每个时期的中心工作，不断地进行抗美援朝爱国运动的宣传教育工作。大杂院的居民对抗美援朝运动还或多或少地有了认识，但对美国企图片面对日媾和和重新武装日本则知道得更少甚至完全不知道。连住在大杂院附近的七区区代表钱顺对美国重新武装日本这个事情也感到“说不上”。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    这些意见，只是根据第七区卧佛寺二条十号后门大杂院的情况而提出的，可能不全面。希望你们把这些意见发表，以引起大家的注意，使抗美援朝运动更加普及、更加深入。
