　　The Glorious Victory of the Chinese and Korean People

The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression invited representatives from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to introduce the situation of the Korean War to the people of the whole country. Several of our comrades were sent back to the country and received a warm welcome and condolences from the people of the whole country. This gives the Volunteer Army great encouragement! We will definitely convey these circumstances to our comrades at the front. Here, we would like to extend our highest revolutionary salute and deepest gratitude to all democratic parties and to the people of the whole country on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, being the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, voluntarily joined the Korean people's struggle against the American aggressors under the call of the great motherland's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and with the enthusiastic encouragement of peace-loving people around the world. Under the unified command of the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, they fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, struck at the American aggressors, and achieved victory. Therefore, the glory of the Volunteer Army completely belongs to our great motherland and people.

Since the American imperialists armed aggression against Korea and occupation of our territory Taiwan, peace in the Far East has been undermined, and the borders of our motherland have been severely threatened. The American imperialists vainly attempt to follow the old path of the Japanese imperialists, enslaving Korea and invading our country. Since late October of last year, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have fought for nearly four months, advancing more than a thousand li, annihilating nearly 100,000 enemies, defeating the enemy's elite "ace" troops, crushing the enemy's arrogance, and enhancing the victorious confidence of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world in defending peace and opposing aggression. On the Korean battlefield, from the facts we personally witnessed, we clearly recognize that we can indeed defeat the world's largest imperialism - the American aggressor. Because the morale of the invading army is indeed low; the fighting will of our Chinese and Korean military and civilians is unprecedentedly high. The facts on the Korean battlefield further prove that the strength of the world's anti-aggression people has greatly exceeded the imperialist aggression forces. The era when the imperialists could do whatever they wanted has passed. In the end, we will surely win completely, and the enemy will surely fail completely.

　　The U.S. Military is the Most Barbaric Army

We want to accuse the American aggressors to the people of the whole country and the world. The American army and the Li Chengwan puppet army are the most barbaric and cruel army in human history, and also the most corrupt and degenerate army. They have degenerated to the point of completely losing their humanity. Their heinous crimes in Korea have aroused the public outrage of all mankind. They are implementing a heinous policy of destroying all cities, villages, factories, schools, and hospitals. Tens of thousands of peaceful humans have been killed by them! This blood debt must be repaid with blood.

The towering crimes of American imperialism are endless. In Seoul and its surrounding areas alone, during the very short period of occupation, 43,590 local people were killed or died from torture, and more than 75,000 were arrested, of whom more than 28,000 were killed, and the rest were starved to death or taken away. According to facts we have heard and seen, before the encirclement and annihilation battle at Changjin Lake, the First Division of the U.S. Marine Corps, upon arriving at Xiajieyuli near Changjin Lake, burned down all the houses in dozens of villages and captured all the residents. The men were captured to serve as puppet soldiers, and the women were all raped. A female student named Jin Junzhen was gang-raped by a group of U.S. soldiers and then killed. They dragged women on cars or tanks for rape. On the tanks we captured, there were still some women's corpses hanging. More than 3,000 old and young people in Xiajieyuli were driven by them into a mountain ditch near Huangcaoling and collectively shot. When our army arrived, some people were still struggling. When our troops saw this situation, no one did not grit their teeth and want to eliminate the enemy immediately.

In the battle of Yunshan, our army found a kind of "sex certificate" on the captured soldiers of the 8th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army, which proved that the US military's atrocities of rape were carried out according to the orders of MacArthur's headquarters. Women who refused rape would be shot. These beasts competed for the number of women they insulted and killed, and whoever had the most was considered the most "glorious"!

After we broke through the 38th parallel, we found a large number of women's corpses and filthy obscene photos in the fortifications of the 19th Regiment of the 24th Division of the U.S. Army. They dragged women into the fortifications for rape and massacred them in large numbers when they retreated. The fortifications of the beasts were full of traces of this kind of animal behavior.

Enemy planes indiscriminately bombed peaceful cities. Almost no complete city can be found in the whole of Korea. Villages and towns along highways and railways have all been destroyed into flat ground. The American invading army and the Li Chengwan bandits killed people and set fires everywhere, doing everything. When the 6th Division of the 2nd Army of the Li puppet army retreated south of the 38th parallel, they used gasoline to burn towns and villages. Suian County originally had more than 500 households, leaving only 12 households. Xinxi County originally had more than 400 households, leaving only 7 households. The U.S. and Li bandits used machine guns to strafe refugees, and corpses were everywhere. Among the seven households left in Xinxi County, two families had only one old man and one old woman left. One was driven mad, and the other was frightened. Lianchuan County near the 38th parallel was burned down, and U.S. planes continued to bomb, and a large number of refugees died in air-raid shelters because they had no clothes or food. Among these villagers, a middle-aged woman took two young children and fled in the face of enemy plane strafing, and was shot to death by machine guns. When she was dying, the two young children hugged their mother and cried loudly, their hands, faces, and bodies covered with their mother's blood.

　　Resisting America and Aiding Korea is Precisely Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country

The atrocities of the U.S. and Li bandits are everywhere. Every day we see villages burned to ashes and people who have been killed. When we see these, we cannot but hate the enemy, and we cannot but shed tears of sympathy for the Korean people. We extremely despise this group of vile and shameless enemies. The soldiers of our Volunteer Army believe that such a barbaric and cruel army is completely made up of beasts! They are animals! They should all be eliminated from the world! When we see enemy planes bombing indiscriminately, we think of the safety of our motherland's people's houses and property, as well as the lives of our parents, brothers, and sisters, and we deeply realize the correctness and greatness of the call of the democratic parties of the motherland to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. Resisting America and aiding Korea is protecting our homes and defending our country, and to protect our homes and defend our country, we must resist America and aid Korea. We and the Korean people are inextricably linked by flesh and blood. We are determined to fight alongside the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to resolutely eliminate this evil enemy.

Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are fighting this brutal enemy with unparalleled bravery. We are advancing while overcoming tremendous difficulties. We are winning victory after victory, while the enemy is suffering repeated defeats. The fate of death awaits them. The people of the whole world know that the reason why we are bound to win is because the war we are waging is just. We are fighting for justice and humanity! We are fighting for patriotism and internationalism! We are fighting to eliminate American beasts! We are fighting to save the Korean and Chinese people from slaughter! We are fighting for the safety of Korean and Chinese women and children! We are fighting to avenge the innocent victims! We are fighting for lasting peace in the Far East and the world! We have 30 million Korean people cooperating in the battle, 475 million Chinese people enthusiastically supporting us, and the enthusiastic support and support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, so our entire army is in high spirits, fighting more and more bravely, and firmly believes in its own strength. Together with all the Korean people, all the Chinese people, and the people of the whole world, there are no insurmountable difficulties. We can defeat any violent enemy.

The fundamental reason why the enemy has suffered successive defeats and will inevitably fail in the end is, as Marshal Stalin pointed out: the war they are waging in Korea is unjust, extremely unpopular, and therefore bound to fail in the end.

　　Heroic Achievements of the Volunteer Army

In combat, we have encountered many difficulties. But because every soldier of the Volunteer Army has a high degree of political consciousness, we not only did not bow to difficulties, but hated the enemy even more, and fought even more bravely. The Korean people and our compatriots in the motherland all helped us in various ways. We are very grateful. Under the call of "Everything for the Victory of the Front," the Korean people contributed everything they had to help us overcome enemy air raids and numerous difficulties and build up logistics. The people of our motherland also organized volunteer engineering teams, medical teams, stretcher teams, and comfort groups to come to the front. Some compatriots even delivered pork from the border of Heilongjiang to the front line of the Han River.

Encouraged by the people of the motherland and the Korean people, we are not afraid of any difficulties. For example, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army guarded the Feihu Mountain position and did not eat for two days and two nights, but still insisted on fighting. The Korean people near Feihu Mountain voluntarily went to the front line to deliver food to the soldiers. Tian Gaoxie, an old worker from the Black Lead Factory, personally organized more than 40 workers to make 300 kilograms of dried rice and braved enemy planes and artillery to deliver the food to the mountain. A woman member of the Women's Alliance, Jin Dexin, also mobilized dozens of women to brave the artillery fire and deliver food to the position. An old woman with white hair, Grandma Jin, saw that our soldiers had no vegetables to eat, ran down the mountain, wrapped her only bowl of sesame salt in a towel and sent it to the position. The soldiers held Feihu Mountain for five days and five nights, annihilating more than 1,800 enemies.

In order to eliminate the enemy, our army often fought in the rain, wind, and snow. In the night battle to outflank Junwuli, a unit braved the rain and crossed 40 li of mountains, and their clothes were all wet. But the soldiers finally endured this difficulty and eliminated the enemy. One company simply wiped out a company of the enemy, with only two of their own injured.

Our Volunteer Army commanders and fighters have learned the combat art of using existing light weapons to defeat enemies with modern equipment. In the battle of Longyuanli, the heroic Guo Zhongtian platoon, one platoon against more than 500 U.S. troops, fought fiercely with the enemy's large number of planes and artillery for a whole day, without any casualties, and captured six artillery pieces, 58 vehicles, and annihilated more than 200 enemies. Our army only consumed 1,305 bullets and 14 hand grenades.

Our brave artillerymen were able to skillfully overcome difficulties, transport the artillery to the front of the position, and constantly strike at the enemy. In the battle to defend Huangcaoling, our artillerymen fought bravely, cooperating with the infantry to annihilate more than 1,000 enemies, destroy hundreds of enemy vehicles and dozens of tanks, and established special meritorious service.

In continuous battles, we captured a large number of enemy weapons and equipped ourselves. The soldiers humorously said: "MacArthur is our chief transportation captain."

Our male and female medical workers, as well as all comrades who participated in battlefield rescue work, carried forward the spirit of selfless struggle and learned new working methods. Our car drivers have also learned new fighting skills and completed their tasks under extremely difficult conditions.

　　Strive for Greater Victory

Dear compatriots! All our victories are inseparable from the national movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country! The encouragement of all democratic parties, mass organizations, and every father, elder, brother, and sister has increased and strengthened our determination and courage to eliminate the American aggressors, and has become the strength for us to overcome difficulties and achieve victory. We know that we carry the glory of the great motherland and the people, so we especially cherish this glory, and we will never fail the love and encouragement of the people of the motherland. We will never be arrogant in victory. We know that the American aggressors and their accomplices are not reconciled to defeat and death. They are continuing to mobilize reinforcements and carry out new crazy adventures in Korea. We fully estimate that there are still difficulties on the road to victory that we need to work hard to overcome. We are improving and enhancing our combat skills with increasing precision, and more closely uniting the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and obeying the command of the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army. We have unparalleled confidence and sufficient ability to eliminate the American aggressors. We are determined to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the American aggressors who refuse to withdraw from Korea together with the Korean people! We resolutely stand on the front line of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, defending the motherland, defending Asian and world peace, responding to the ardent hopes of the people of the motherland, and creating greater and more glory for the motherland!

Marshal Stalin, the revolutionary teacher of the world, has ruthlessly exposed the criminal plans and conspiracies of the US-British imperialist bloc to launch a new war of aggression in his interview with the Pravda reporter, and pointed out the correct path for the people of the world to maintain peace and stop war. The people of the world are launching a movement to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression. We, the Chinese people, must stand side by side with the Soviet people, the Korean people, the people of all people's democratic countries, and the people of all countries in the world under the banner of the great people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong, on the forefront of the movement to defend world peace, resist the aggressors! Our great motherland with its 475 million people and the glorious People's Volunteer Army has made a great contribution to the cause of world peace. We hope that all compatriots in the country, everyone with a sense of justice and patriotism, will actively, universally, and deeply carry out the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, together with the Korean people, together with the people's democratic countries headed by the great Soviet Union, and together with the peace-loving people of the world, to extinguish the flames of war ignited by the American aggressors in Korea, defend our great motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world!

Long live our great motherland and people!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the victory of the Chinese and Korean people against the American aggressors!

Long live General Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese people!

Long live Marshal Stalin, leader of the world's people!

　　光荣属于伟大的祖国和人民
    ——中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若在中央人民广播电台的广播词摘要
            中朝人民的光荣胜利
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会邀请中国人民志愿军派代表向全国人民介绍朝鲜战争的情况，我们几个同志被派回国，受到全国人民的热烈欢迎和慰问。这给予我们志愿军以莫大的鼓励！我们一定把这些情形传达给前方同志。在这里，我们谨代表中国人民志愿军全体指战员，向全国各民主党派，向全国人民致以崇高的革命敬礼和深厚的谢意！
    中国人民志愿军，是中国人民的优秀儿女，在伟大的祖国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动的召唤之下，在全国和全世界爱好和平的人民热烈鼓舞之下，志愿地参加了朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的斗争，在朝鲜人民军总司令部统一指挥之下，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打击美国侵略者，取得了胜利。因此，志愿军的光荣，完全属于我们伟大的祖国和人民。
    自从美帝国主义者武装侵略朝鲜与占领我国领土台湾后，远东和平即被破坏，我祖国边疆即遭受严重的威胁。美国帝国主义妄想沿着日本帝国主义的老路，奴役朝鲜，侵略我国。自从去年十月下旬到现在，我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军将近四个月的作战，前进一千余里，歼敌近十万人，打垮了敌人精锐的“王牌”军，打垮了敌人的气焰，提高了中朝两国人民和全世界人民保卫和平反对侵略的胜利信心。我们在朝鲜战场上，从亲身看到的事实中，认清我们确实可以把世界上最大的帝国主义——美国侵略者打败。因为侵略军队的士气的确是低的；我们中朝军民的战斗意志是空前高涨的。朝鲜战场上的事实，更证明了世界反侵略的人民的力量已经大大超过帝国主义侵略势力。帝国主义要怎样就怎样的时代已经过去了。最后的结果，我们一定完全胜利，敌人一定完全失败。
            美军是最野蛮的军队
    我们要在这里向全国和全世界人民控诉美国侵略者。美国的军队和李承晚傀儡军，是人类历史上最野蛮最残暴的军队，同时也是最腐败最下流的军队。他们已经堕落到完全丧失人性的程度。他们在朝鲜的滔天罪行，已经激起全人类的公愤。他们正在执行着毁灭一切城市、乡村、工厂、学校、医院的罪恶政策。成千成万的和平人类被他们杀死了！这笔血债必须用血来还。
    美帝国主义的滔天罪行是说不完的。仅仅汉城及其附近地区，在很短的沦陷期间，当地人民被杀害和因受酷刑致死的就有四万三千五百九十人，被捕的七万五千余人，其中有两万八千多人被杀害，其余的都被饿死、或带走。据我们耳闻眼见的事实，当长津湖包围歼灭战之前，美国海军陆战队第一师，到达长津湖附近的下碣隅里，就曾把几十个村庄的房屋全部烧光，把居民全部捉走。男的被抓去当伪军，女的全部被强奸。一个名叫金俊真的女学生，被一群美军兽兵轮奸后，又被杀死。他们把妇女拖在汽车或坦克上强奸。在我们缴获的坦克车上，还挂着些妇女的尸体，下碣隅里三千多名老幼，被他们赶到黄草岭附近一个山沟里，集体枪杀。当我军到达时，还有一些人在挣扎着。我们的部队见到这种情形，没有一个人不咬牙切齿，要立刻消灭敌人。
    在云山战斗中，我军在美军骑兵第一师第八团的俘虏兵身上，发现一种“性交证”，这证明美军强奸的兽行，是按照麦克阿瑟总部的命令干的。妇女拒绝强奸就会遭到枪杀。这伙野兽们，拿侮辱和杀害妇女的数目作比赛，谁最多就算谁最“光荣”！
    我们突破三八线后，在美军二十四师十九联队的工事里，发现大量的妇女尸体和肮脏不堪的淫秽照片。他们把妇女拖进工事里强奸，并在败退时大量屠杀。兽兵们的工事里，到处有着这种兽行的痕迹。
    敌机滥炸和平城市。几乎全朝鲜找不到一个完整的城市了。沿公路铁路线上的村镇，全部被毁成平地。美国侵略军和李承晚匪军到处杀人放火，无所不为。李伪军第二军团第六师团向三八线以南败退的时候，用汽油焚烧城镇村庄。遂安县原有五百余户，只剩下十二户。新溪县原有四百余户，只剩下七户。美李匪军用机枪扫射难民，尸体遍野。新溪县所剩七户中，有两家只剩一个老大爷和老大娘，他们一个气疯了，一个吓呆了。三八线附近的涟川县被烧光后，美国飞机还不断炸射，大批难民因为无衣无食而死在防空洞中。在这些乡民中，有一个中年妇人带两个幼儿，冒着敌机扫射逃难，被机枪打死。在她将死未死的时候，两个幼儿抱着他的母亲号啕大哭，满手满脸满身都是母亲的鲜血。
            抗美援朝正是保家卫国
    美李匪军的暴行，到处都是。我们每天都看到被烧成灰烬的村庄和被残杀了的人民。我们看到这些，不能不痛恨敌人，也不能不向朝鲜人民流出同情的热泪。我们极端鄙视这群下流无耻的敌人。我们志愿军的战士们认为像这样野蛮和残暴的军队，完全是野兽！是畜牲！应该在人世间全部消灭！我们看到敌机滥炸，就会联想到我们祖国人民的房屋财产以及父母兄弟姊妹的生命安全，就深深地体会到祖国各民主党派抗美援朝保家卫国号召的正确和伟大。抗美援朝就是保家卫国，保家卫国必须抗美援朝。我们和朝鲜人民是血肉不可分的，我们决计和朝鲜人民一道，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，坚决消灭这个万恶的敌人。
    我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，正在以无比的英勇打击着这个残暴的敌人。我们正在克服巨大的困难中前进着。我们是胜利接着胜利，而敌人却是连遭失败。死亡的命运等待着他们。全世界人民都知道，我们所以必然胜利，是由于我们所进行的战争是正义的。我们是为正义人道而战！为爱国主义和国际主义而战！为消灭美国野兽而战！为使朝鲜和中国人民免于屠杀而战！为朝鲜和中国妇女和儿童的安全而战！为替无辜死难者复仇而战！为远东与世界的持久和平而战！我们有三千万朝鲜人民协同作战，有四亿七千五百万中国人民热烈支援，有全世界爱好和平的国家和人民热烈支援和拥护，所以我们全军士气高涨，愈战愈勇，坚信自己的力量。我们和全朝鲜人民、全中国人民、全世界人民在一起，没有不可克服的困难。我们可以战胜任何狂暴的敌人。
    而敌人所以连续失败和最后必然失败的根本原因，正如斯大林大元帅所指出：他们在朝鲜进行的战争是非正义的，是极端不得人心的，因而最后必然失败。
            志愿军的英雄战绩
    在作战中，我们曾碰到很多困难。但由于志愿军每个战士都有高度的政治觉悟，我们不但没有向困难低头，反而更加仇恨敌人，作战也更加勇敢。朝鲜人民和我们祖国的同胞，都用种种方法来帮助我们。我们非常感谢。朝鲜人民在“一切为了前线的胜利”的号召之下，贡献了自己的一切，帮助我们战胜敌机扰乱和重重的困难，建设了后勤工作。我们祖国人民也组织了志愿的工程队、医疗队、担架队、慰劳团到前线来。有的同胞一直由黑龙江边把猪肉送到汉江前线。
    在祖国人民和朝鲜人民鼓舞之下，我们什么困难也不怕。例如志愿军某部守备飞虎山阵地，两天两夜没有吃饭，还是一样坚持战斗。飞虎山附近的朝鲜人民，自动地上火线给战士送饭。黑铅厂一位老工人田高燮，亲自组织四十多个工人，做了三百斤大米干饭，冒着敌人的飞机大炮，把饭送到山上。一个妇女同盟会会员金德心，也发动数十名妇女，冒着炮火把饭送到阵地上。一位白发苍苍的金老太太，看到我们的战士没有菜吃，跑下山去，把自己仅有的一碗芝麻盐用手巾包住送到阵地上。战士们坚守飞虎山五天五夜，歼灭了一千八百多个敌人。
    为了消灭敌人，我军常常冒雨冒风雪作战。在迂回军隅里的夜战中，有一个部队冒雨翻越了四十里大山，衣服全部湿透。但是战士们终于忍受了这种困难，消灭了敌人，其中有一个连干脆歼灭敌人一个连，自己只有两人负伤。
    我们志愿军指挥员战斗员，学会了用现有的轻便武器战胜具有现代化装备的敌人的战斗艺术。在龙源里战斗中，英雄的郭忠田排，一个排对美军五百余，与敌人大量飞机大炮激战竟日，自己无一伤亡，并夺获大炮六门，汽车五十八辆，歼灭敌人二百余名，我军仅消耗子弹一千三百零五发，手榴弹十四枚。
    我们神勇的炮兵，能够巧妙地克服了困难，将大炮运到阵地前沿，不断地打击敌人。在坚守黄草岭的战斗中，我们的炮兵英勇作战，配合步兵，歼灭了一千多敌人，击毁了敌人的数百辆汽车和数十辆坦克，建立了特别的功勋。
    在连续战斗中，我们夺获了敌人大量的武器，装备了我们自己。战士们幽默地说：“麦克阿瑟是咱的运输大队长。”
    我们的男女医务工作者，以及参加战场救护工作的全体同志，发扬了忘我的奋斗精神，学会了新的工作方法。我们的汽车司机，也学会了新的斗争艺术，在万分的困难下完成自己的任务。
            争取更大的胜利
    亲爱的同胞们！我们的所有胜利，和全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动是分不开的！各民主党派各群众团体以及每一个父老兄弟姊妹对我们的鼓舞，都增加了和更加坚定了我们消灭美国侵略者的决心和勇气，都成为我们战胜困难取得胜利的力量。我们知道我们带着伟大的祖国和人民的光荣，因而我们特别珍贵这种光荣，我们绝不会辜负祖国人民的热爱和鼓励。我们在胜利中绝不骄傲。我们知道美国侵略者及其帮凶，是不甘心失败和死亡的。它们正继续调集援兵，在朝鲜实行新的疯狂的冒险。我们充分估计到在胜利的道路上，还有困难需要我们努力来克服。我们正在精益求精地改进与提高我们的战斗艺术，更加紧密地团结朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，服从朝鲜人民军总司令部的指挥。我们有无比的信心和足够的本领消灭美国侵略者。我们决心和朝鲜人民一起，坚决、彻底、干净全部消灭不肯撤出朝鲜的美国侵略者！我们坚决站在抗美援朝保家卫国的最前线，保卫祖国，保卫亚洲与世界和平，回答祖国人民的热望，为祖国创造更大更多的光荣！
    全世界革命的导师斯大林大元帅在和真理报记者的谈话中，已经无情地揭露了美英帝国主义集团发动新的侵略战争的罪恶计划与阴谋，并且向全世界人民指示了维护和平制止战争的正确道路。全世界人民正在开展着保卫和平反对侵略战争的运动。我们中国人民，定要在伟大人民领袖毛泽东主席的旗帜下，和苏联人民，朝鲜人民、各人民民主国家人民以及全世界各国人民，并肩站在保卫世界和平运动的最前线，抗击侵略者！我们伟大祖国四亿七千五百万人民和光荣的人民志愿军，已经给世界和平事业作了巨大的贡献。我们希望全国同胞，每一个有正义感、有爱国心的人们，都来积极地普遍地深入地开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动，和朝鲜人民一起，和以伟大苏联为首的各人民民主国家一起，和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，扑灭美国侵略者在朝鲜燃起的战火，保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫远东和世界的和平！
    我们伟大的祖国和人民万岁！
    中朝人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    中朝两国人民反抗美国侵略者胜利万岁！
    朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界人民领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
                                  （文中小标题是新华社编者所加）
