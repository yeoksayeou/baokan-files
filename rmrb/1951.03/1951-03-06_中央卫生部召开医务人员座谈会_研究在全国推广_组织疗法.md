The Ministry of Health Convenes a Symposium of Medical Personnel to Study the Nationwide Promotion of "Tissue Therapy"

　　February 28, 1951, marked the 76th birthday of Academician Filatov, the Soviet inventor of tissue therapy. On this day, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government convened a symposium on "Tissue Therapy" to study and promote his great creation. Participants included Soviet experts, medical experts, clinicians, and representatives from health agencies in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Xinjiang, and other regions, totaling more than 60 people. At the meeting, everyone reported on the experiences and achievements of "Tissue Therapy" research in various regions, and discussed how to carry out this work nationwide as a starting point for learning from advanced Soviet medicine.

　　Dr. Markova, a Soviet expert, first introduced the use of Filatov's "Tissue Therapy" in the Soviet Union since 1933: After animal or plant tissues are removed, they are placed in an environment that threatens their survival but does not destroy their vitality, causing them to undergo biochemical changes and produce a "biogenic stimulator." When this tissue is transplanted into the human body, it can promote the diseased tissue to enhance its resistance to disease. After more than 3,000 uses by Filatov and other Soviet doctors, it has been proven that this therapy has achieved significant and good results in ophthalmic diseases such as keratitis, optic nerve atrophy, gastric and duodenal ulcers, asthma, and various skin ulcers. Filatov once said that an organ loses its function faster than its tissue dies, so when the function disappears while the tissue is still alive, it is the most suitable time to use tissue therapy. However, this therapy is still novel to this day. For example, biogenic stimulators are organic acids with high heat resistance and specific gravity, and the various physiological and therapeutic mechanisms they play in various parts of the human body are worthy of further study. Therefore, in her speech, she emphasized that our task today is how to correctly promote and organize the research and use of "Tissue Therapy" so that it becomes a powerful tool for overcoming diseases.

　　The Northeast is the region that first used "Tissue Therapy." According to the report by Dr. Wang Sufu of the Affiliated Hospital of the China Medical University in Shenyang, since the Affiliated Hospital of the China Medical University in Xingshan began to use "Tissue Therapy" on a trial basis in 1948, it has been successively promoted to troops and hospitals in Harbin, Shenyang, and Dalian. The Affiliated Hospital of the China Medical University in Shenyang has done more than 200 cases so far. Because this method is still in the preliminary trial stage, the theoretical and operational experience is not yet fully complete, and the equipment is not perfect. Generally speaking, two-thirds of the 200 cases have achieved certain therapeutic effects, and one-third have not seen significant therapeutic effects, but no adverse results have occurred. According to experience, injecting tissue extract is more convenient and faster than implanting tissue material. For more than two years, they have studied the value of "Tissue Therapy" in preventive medicine during the treatment process. They first studied the role of biogenic stimulators in frostbite prevention, using the liver of dogs subjected to cold stimulation to prepare antifreeze tissue fluid, and tested it on white mice in cold air at minus 20 degrees Celsius. As a result, mice that had not been injected with this fluid died after one and a half hours, while those that had been injected could last up to four and a half hours. If the tail was subjected to the same artificial freezing, the former's tail would necrosis by 5.4 cm, while the latter's would necrosis by 1.9 cm. In addition, research on the prevention of malignant tumors is also underway.

　　Representatives from other regions reported on cases of using "Tissue Therapy." Beijing Hospital began using it under the guidance of Soviet doctors in February 1951 and has now done 17 cases. In addition, Beijing Railway General Hospital, Beijing Army General Hospital, Beijing Third Hospital, Tianjin Tianhe Hospital, and Peking University Medical College Affiliated Hospital have all used it, mainly for ophthalmic, surgical, and dermatological diseases, with very good results. However, there are also cases where the effect is not significant, which may be due to the unscientific selection and storage of materials, incorrect selection of indications, and insufficient experience due to the short trial period.

　　Finally, Vice Minister of Health He Cheng of the Ministry of Health delivered a speech. He pointed out that it has been 17 years since Academician Filatov of the Soviet Union first created "Tissue Therapy" in 1933. Now all parts of the Soviet Union are researching and adopting it. Our Northeast began to apply it in 1948, and Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Xinjiang also successively tried it in 1950, but the nationwide promotion in an organized way only begins today. According to literature and experiments, "Tissue Therapy" is a good treatment method and has been proven to treat many diseases. In this sense, it should be promoted. However, it is not feasible to apply it rashly to all diseases. This therapy, from theory to practical operation, is still in the stage of continuous development and needs to be continuously researched and supplemented in the process of application. This is especially important for our China because we are still taking the first step. Therefore, it also increases our responsibility. Also, because its theory and practical operation still need to be researched and supplemented, it is easy for some medical personnel to doubt it. Even some may show conservative and repulsive thoughts. This is also unavoidable. As long as we do more introduction and publicity work in the future and constantly improve the theory and operation, the thoughts of doubt and repulsion will gradually decrease. The obstacles in the promotion can be overcome. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government calls on health agencies and health personnel at all levels across the country to conduct organized research and adoption in the future. All medical colleges and hospitals with conditions should not only use tissue therapy clinically but also conduct research work, because in the relevant issues of "Tissue Therapy," theory lags far behind practice. Therefore, biochemists, pathologists, physiologists, pharmacologists, clinicians, etc. should all participate in the research. For example, the types of tissues and their indications, the technical operations of tissue collection, impregnation, and storage, the principles of the role of biogenic stimulators on pathological tissues, biochemical changes, and pharmacodynamic standards must all be clearly affirmed. These are the responsibilities of researchers. In addition, the value of tissue therapy in the field of preventive medicine also needs to be studied. Health administrative agencies should provide practical assistance in promoting "Tissue Therapy" and prepare research and adoption conditions for experts, such as organizing "Tissue Therapy Research Groups," uniformly collecting and storing tissue therapy materials, and preparing research equipment and researchers. The progress of all research or treatment work should be regularly recorded, such as the manufacturing and storage methods of tissue materials, the methods of use, methods, indications, effects, and so on, should be recorded in detail for the purpose of summarizing experience. The achievements obtained should be announced in medical journals and newspapers. The Chinese New Medicine Report and the journals of the Chinese Medical Association will prepare to publish special issues this year, and the Health News will introduce them at any time. Localities can also organize lectures, seminars, and even training classes to promote them. In short, "Tissue Therapy" already has a certain position and inevitable development prospects in treatment, and even in preventive medicine. We should attach importance to this part of the new medicine that is in the process of development and organize research and promotion. This will be beneficial to the people's health cause.

　　中央卫生部召开医务人员座谈会
    研究在全国推广“组织疗法”
    一九五一年二月二十八日是苏联组织疗法发明者费拉托夫院士七十六岁的诞生日。中央人民政府卫生部在这一天召开了关于“组织疗法”的座谈会，研究与推广他的伟大创造。参加的有苏联专家，北京、天津、沈阳、西安、新疆等地的医学专家、临床大夫及卫生机关代表等六十余人。会上大家报告了各地研究“组织疗法”的经验与成绩，并讨论了如何在全国范围内展开此项工作，以作为学习苏联先进医学的开端。
    苏联专家马尔叩娃大夫首先介绍了一九三三年苏联对费拉托夫所发表的“组织疗法”的使用情况：将动物或植物的组织取下后，放于一能威胁其生存而又不能将其本身生活力破坏的环境，使其由于生物化学的变化产生一种“生物原性刺激素”，用此组织移植于人体时，则能促进病的组织增强抵抗疾病的作用。经过费氏及其他苏联医生三千多次使用的结果，证明此种疗法在眼科疾病如角膜炎、视神经萎缩、胃与十二指肠溃疡、喘息及各种皮肤溃疡等，均收到显著的良好效果。费拉托夫曾经说过，一个器官，功能比组织灭亡得快，所以，当组织还未灭亡而功能消失时，是使用组织疗法的最适合的时期。然而这种疗法到现在为止还是新颖的，例如生物原刺激素是抗高热、比重大的一种有机酸物质，其对人体各部所起的生理上与治疗上的各种机转程序还值得更进一步地加以研究。因此她在发言中着重指出：我们今天的任务是如何正确地推广及组织“组织疗法”的研究与使用，使其成为战胜疾病的一个强有力的工具。
    东北是最先使用“组织疗法”的地区。根据沈阳中国医科大学附属医院王素孚大夫的报告，自一九四八年由兴山中国医科大学附属医院开始试用“组织疗法”以来，曾先后推广到部队及哈尔滨、沈阳、大连各医院中。沈阳医大附属医院至今已做了二百余例。因为此方法尚处在初步试行的阶段中，理论与操作的经验还不够十分充实，设备方面也不够完善，概括说来，在二百病例中有三分之二收到了一定的治疗效果，三分之一未见显著的治疗效果，但亦未发生任何不良结果。根据经验，用组织浸出液施行注射，比植入组织材料便利，且效果快。二年余来，他们在治疗的过程中研究了“组织疗法”在预防医学上的价值。他们首先研究生物原刺激素在防冻方面所能起的作用，以经过寒冷刺激后狗的肝脏制成抗冻组织液，用小白鼠在零下二十度的冷气中试验。结果，未经注射此液者一个半小时冻死，而经过注射者可耐至四个半小时。如将尾部加以同样的人工冻结，前者尾巴坏死五·四公分，后者一·九公分。此外还正在研究对恶性肿瘤的预防作用。
    其他各地代表均报告了使用“组织疗法”的病例。北京医院在苏联大夫的指导下，自一九五一年二月起开始使用，现在已做了十七例。此外，北京铁路总医院、北京陆军总医院、北京市第三医院、天津天和医院及北大医学院附属医院均曾使用，主要是用在眼科、外科及皮肤科的疾病，效果甚好。但也有效果不显著的，这可能由于所取材料与贮藏方法不够科学，适应症选择不对以及试用时间尚短经验不够所致。
    最后由中央卫生部贺诚副部长讲话，他指出：自一九三三年苏联费拉托夫院士开始创用“组织疗法”以来已经十七年了。现在全苏联各地都在研究采用中，我们东北从一九四八年开始应用，一九五○年北京、天津、上海、西安以及新疆各地亦先后试用，但有组织地作全国性的推动今天才开始。根据文献及实验来看，“组织疗法”是一种良好的治疗方法，并已经证明能治疗许多病，就这点说，是应该推广的。但如果草率地将它应用到一切疾病，也是不行的。此疗法由理论到实际操作，还在继续发展的阶段当中，需要在应用过程中继续加以研究与补充，这对于我们中国尤为重要，因为我们尚在走第一步。因此也就加重了我们的责任。也正因为它的理论与实际操作，尚须加以研究补充，也就容易使某些医务人员对它产生怀疑。甚至可能有个别的表现出保守与排斥的思想。这也是难免的。只要我们今后多做介绍与宣传工作，将理论与操作不断的提高，则怀疑与排斥的思想，会逐渐减少。推广中的障碍是可以克服的。中央人民政府卫生部号召全国各级卫生机关与卫生人员，今后要进行有组织的研究与采用，各医学院校及有条件的医院，不只要在临床上采用组织疗法，还要进行研究工作，因为在“组织疗法”的有关问题上，理论远落在实用之后。因此，生物化学家、病理学家、生理学家、药理学家、临床学家等都要参加研究。例如，组织的种类及其适应症，组织的采取，浸渍及贮藏方法等技术操作，生物原刺激素对病理组织所起作用的原理，生物化学的变化，以及药效学标准等，都必须明确地肯定起来。这都是研究家的责任。此外组织疗法在预防医学领域中的价值，亦有研究的必要。卫生行政机关要在推行“组织疗法”中给以实际帮助，为专家们准备研究与采用条件，如组织“组织疗法研究组”，统一搜集与贮藏组织疗法的材料及准备研究器材与研究人员等。所有研究工作或治疗工作的进程，都应当有经常的记载，如组织材料的制造法与贮藏法、使用的方式、方法、适应症、效果及其它等等，都要详细记载，以便总结经验。对于已获得的成就，要在医学杂志与报纸中宣布。中华新医学报及中华医学会的杂志，要准备在今年出专号，健康报更要随时介绍。各地尚可组织讲演会、座谈会，以至训练班，以便推广。总之，“组织疗法”在治疗方面，甚至在预防医学方面，已有一定的地位与必然的发展前途，我们对于这一正在发展过程中的新医学的一部分，应当加以重视，并有组织地加以研究与推广。这对人民的健康事业，会有好处的。
