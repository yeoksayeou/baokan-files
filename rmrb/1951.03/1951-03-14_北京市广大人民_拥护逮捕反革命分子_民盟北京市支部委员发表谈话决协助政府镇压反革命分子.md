The Broad Masses of Beijing Support the Arrest of Counter-Revolutionary Elements
Beijing Municipal Branch Committee of the China Democratic League Issues Statement Resolving to Assist the Government in Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Elements

[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] In recent days, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has arrested a batch of counter-revolutionary criminals, which has been supported by the broad masses of the people. They unanimously believe that only by eliminating counter-revolutionary elements can social security be consolidated and production and construction be developed. Li Zhenting, a poor peasant from the northern suburbs, said: "Now the government has really opened its eyes. Zhang Tong should have been arrested long ago. It will be easier to work in the village in the future." Zhu Zhongkang, manager of Yongfeng Chemical Factory in the western suburbs, said: "The government's arrest of spies and bad people is exactly what the people want. If bad elements are not eliminated, there will be no peace in the area."

The masses who have suffered from these counter-revolutionary criminals feel relieved and vented their anger. Liu Weiqing, a small businessman in Mentougou, said: "Huang Jichen (a spy) used to rely on the power of the enemy and was very fierce! Even my small stall was bullied by him. After liberation, I really wanted to smash him to death. This time the government is really good and vented my anger." Tian Changhai, a poor peasant from Xibahe in the northern suburbs, said: "Shi Fenglin was arrested, good! He often said destructive things, and no one in our village doesn't hate him."

Some of the masses, from this arrest of counter-revolutionary elements, further realized the destructive conspiracies of the bandits and improved their vigilance. Xu Fengshi, a resident of the vegetable cellar in the western suburbs, said: "Look at that Mei Jianwu, he wore tattered cotton clothes after liberation and looked very poor. It turns out he was pretending to be a grandson. His rumors scared us so much that we didn't dare to sleep at night. This time the government removed a scourge for us." Many people have also proposed to help the government suppress the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Han Kangshi, a farmer from Xiaoshan Village in the western suburbs, said: "Chen Yongli (leader of the I-Kuan-Tao altar) was arrested. I can testify against him. I know about his raping women and forcing people to death." Wang Wanyou and Zhang Zuoxing, farmers from Fengtai, both said: "When we put our fingerprints on the indictment of Fan Peiying's crimes, don't forget us." Liu Weiqing, a small businessman in Mentougou, said: "In the future, if I hear about the activities of bad people, I will immediately tell the government." The masses in the Shijingshan area have reported the situation of bad elements to the police station and also requested to be given the task of monitoring bad elements.

[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] Wu Han, Wen Jiasi, Min Ganghou, Zeng Zhaolun, Ye Duzhuang, Li Jiansheng, Tao Dayong and other members of the Beijing Municipal Branch Committee of the China Democratic League issued written statements, supporting the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" recently promulgated by the Central People's Government. Wu Han issued a written statement, believing that: this regulation gives cadres and the masses a legal weapon to suppress counter-revolutionaries. It clearly stipulates the sentencing standards for dealing with counter-revolutionary elements. Accurate mastery of this weapon and standard will ensure that no one who does not deserve to die will be wrongly killed, and no bandit who deserves to die will be let go.

Wen Jiasi said in a written statement: "I express my firm support for the government's promulgation of the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, because this is a prerequisite for defending the fruits of the revolution and engaging in construction."

Min Ganghou's written statement called on all members of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League to carry out a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionary elements, to study the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries carefully, to strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements from infiltrating the China Democratic League organization, and to actively assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionary work.

Ye Duzhuang said in a written statement: "Last winter, when I participated in land reform in Shandong, I personally experienced the power of the People's Court against reactionary and lawless landlords. I believe that the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries will have the same power against all counter-revolutionary elements."

Li Jiansheng issued a written statement saying: In the past year's work, we have also encountered many bad people who took advantage of the loopholes, attempting to use the organizational weaknesses of democratic parties to carry out reactionary sabotage activities. In the future, we should be more vigilant, ensure that bad elements do not infiltrate the organization, and trace the source of every bad element until it is eliminated.

Zeng Zhaolun and Tao Dayong also issued written statements, supporting the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries.

　　北京市广大人民
    拥护逮捕反革命分子
    民盟北京市支部委员发表谈话决协助政府镇压反革命分子
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府公安局连日逮捕了一批反革命罪犯，得到广大人民的拥护，他们一致认为只有把反革命分子搞干净了，才能巩固社会治安，发展生产建设。北郊贫农李振亭说：“现在政府真睁开眼了，张桐这小子早就该抓起来。以后村里的工作好做了。”西郊永丰化学工厂经理朱仲康说：“政府逮捕特务和坏人正是人民的要求，要不肃清坏分子，地方就不得安宁。”
    受过这些反革命罪犯迫害的群众都觉得解了恨，出了气。门头沟的小商人刘维青说：“黄杰臣（特务）过去仗着敌人的势力，可厉害啦！连我摆个小摊摊都受他的气，解放后我真想砸死他，这回政府真好，给我出了气。”北郊西坝河贫农田长海说：“施凤林给逮捕了，该！他常说破坏话，我们村谁不恨他？”
    有些群众从这次逮捕反革命分子，进一步认识了匪犯们的破坏阴谋，提高了警惕。西郊菜库居民许冯氏说：“瞧那梅建梧，解放后穿着破棉袄多寒伧，原来是装孙子。他造谣言吓得我们晚上不敢睡觉，这回政府给我们除了害。”许多群众并纷纷提出要帮助政府镇压反革命分子的破坏活动。西郊小山庄农民韩康氏说：“把陈永利（一贯道坛主）逮去了，我给他作证，他强奸妇女，逼死人命的事我都知道。”丰台农民王万友、张作兴都说：“如果在控诉樊配英的罪行状上盖手印时千万别忘了我们。”门头沟小商人刘维青说：“以后我听到了坏人的活动，马上就告诉政府。”石景山一带的群众纷纷向派出所报告坏分子的情况，还要求给他们监视坏分子的任务。

    【本报讯】中国民主同盟北京市支部委员吴晗、闻家驷、闵刚侯、曾昭抡、叶笃庄、李健生、陶大镛等分别发表书面谈话，拥护中央人民政府最近颁布的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》。吴晗发表书面谈话，认为：这个条例给予干部和群众以镇压反革命的法律武器，它明确规定了处理反革命分子的量刑标准，确切的掌握这种武器和标准，必不会错杀一个罪不至死的人，更不会放纵一个罪该万死的匪徒。
    闻家驷在书面谈话中说：“我对于政府颁布惩治反革命的条例，表示坚决的拥护，因为这是保卫革命的果实和从事建设的一个先决条件。”
    闵刚侯的书面谈话，号召民主同盟北京市支部全体盟员向反革命分子进行坚决斗争，好好学习惩治反革命条例，严防反革命分子钻进民盟组织里来，并主动积极地协助人民政府进行镇压反革命工作。
    叶笃庄在书面谈话中说：“去冬我在山东参加土地改革时，亲自体验到人民法庭对于反动不法地主的威力，我相信惩治反革命条例，对一切反革命分子将会发生同样的威力。”
    李健生发表书面谈话说：在一年来的工作中，我们也曾遇到不少的坏人钻空子，企图利用民主党派组织上的弱点，进行反动的破坏活动，今后我们应该更加提高警惕。保证不让坏分子钻进组织，并追究每一个坏分子的来源，直到消灭它为止。
    曾昭抡、陶大镛也发表了书面谈话，拥护惩治反革命条例。
