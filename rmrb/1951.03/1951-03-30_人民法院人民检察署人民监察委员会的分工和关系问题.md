　　The Division of Labor and Relationship between the People's Court, the People's Procuratorate, and the People's Supervisory Committee

    Question: What is the division of labor and relationship between the People's Court, the People's Procuratorate, and the People's Supervisory Committee?
    Answer: The People's Court is the judicial organ of the people, and its responsibility is to adjudicate criminal cases, civil cases, and other non-litigious matters prescribed by laws and decrees (such as notarization, etc.). The People's Procuratorate is the procuratorial organ, and its main responsibility is to investigate all illegal events. The People's Supervisory Committee is a supervisory organ belonging to the administrative department, and its responsibility is to supervise illegal and derelict acts of government organs and public servants.
    The authority of the People's Supervisory Committee is limited to administrative sanctions, and it does not have the power of adjudication or prosecution. In cases that must be sanctioned by law, they should be transferred to the procuratorial organ for handling. If, during the process of investigating a case, the procuratorial organ believes that the party involved should be subject to administrative sanctions, it should also transfer the case to the supervisory organ for handling.
    The main authority of the procuratorial organ is to investigate all illegal events and to file public prosecutions with the court on behalf of the state. The People's Court is the judicial organ and adjudicates all criminal and civil cases. Therefore, the relationship between the two is extremely close. However, in terms of leadership, the People's Courts at all levels are part of the People's Governments at all levels and are led by the People's Governments at all levels, while also being guided and supervised by the People's Courts and judicial organs at higher levels. The same applies to the People's Procuratorates at all levels, which are led by the People's Governments at the same level and also by the People's Procuratorates at higher levels.
    Question: What is the division of labor and relationship between the Legislative Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Justice, and the People's Court?
    Answer: The responsibility of the Legislative Affairs Commission is to research, draft, and review various draft laws and regulations; while the Ministry of Justice is the organ in charge of national judicial administration matters. There is no subordinate relationship between the two. They may contact each other when work requires or when researching relevant business issues. Since the Ministry of Justice is in charge of judicial administration, it has a subordinate relationship with the People's Courts at all levels.

　　人民法院人民检察署人民监察委员会的分工和关系问题
    问：人民法院、人民检察署和人民监察委员会的分工和关系如何？
    答：人民法院是人民的审判机关，其职责是审判刑事案件、民事案件及其他法令所定的非讼事件（如公证等）。人民检察署是检察机关，其主要职责是检察一切违法事件。人民监察委员会是属于行政部门的监察机关，其职责是监察政府机关及公务人员违法失职事件。
    人民监察委员会的职权，只限于行政处分，没有审判和检察之权；凡遇必须法律制裁的案件，就应送交检察机关办理。而检察机关在检察案件过程中，认为案件当事人应受行政处分，也应该把该案送交监察机关处理。
    检察机关的主要职权是检察一切违法事件，代表国家向法院提起公诉。人民法院为审判机关，审判一切刑、民事案件。因此，两者之间的关系是极密切的。但在领导关系上，各级人民法院是各级人民政府组成的一部分，受各级人民政府的领导，同时又受上级人民法院及司法机关的指导与监督。各级人民检察署也是一样，一方面受同级人民政府的领导，同时又受上级人民检察署的领导。
    问：法制委员会、司法部和人民法院的分工和关系如何？
    答：法制委员会的职责是研究、草拟与审议各种法规草案；而司法部为主持国家司法行政事宜的机关，两者无隶属关系。在因工作需要或研究有关业务问题时，得彼此联系。司法部因主管司法行政工作，故对各级人民法院有隶属关系。
