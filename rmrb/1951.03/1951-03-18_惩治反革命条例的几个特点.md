　　Several Characteristics of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries
       Guo Minghua
    After the promulgation and implementation of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries of the People's Republic of China, newspapers and magazines across the country have published editorials and special articles to discuss them, and they have all explained the political significance of these regulations very clearly. Here, I would like to focus on the legal aspects to talk about the spirit of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries, hoping to make the general public better understand and pay attention to these regulations.

    To understand the spirit of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries (that is, the sum of the characteristics of all its legal provisions), one must understand it from the basic characteristics of this regulation. What are the basic characteristics of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries?

    First, it has a clear class nature. Marx and Engels said in the Communist Manifesto: "The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles." Law is the manifestation of the will of the ruling class, that is, the concrete manifestation of the ideology and morality of the ruling class. In the class struggle, the law plays a great role; and criminal laws, especially the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries, occupy a more important position than other laws, so its class nature is particularly clear. This is absolutely different from the bourgeois law, which often tries to conceal its class nature to deceive the people. Where is the class nature of our Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries manifested? Article 2 of this regulation says it most specifically and clearly, it says: "All counterrevolutionary criminals who aim to overthrow the people's democratic regime and undermine the people's democratic cause shall be punished according to these Regulations." This clearly declares who are the counterrevolutionaries and what is the purpose of punishing counterrevolutionaries. The promulgation of these regulations allows the revolutionary people to thoroughly draw a line between the enemy and ourselves in legal thought, and provides judicial cadres with the correct standards for convicting and sentencing counterrevolutionaries, so that they can more effectively suppress counterrevolutionary activities and provide a strong guarantee for the people's democratic regime. For counterrevolutionaries, it also gives them a serious warning and points out the path they should take: quickly repent to the people, otherwise they will surely cut off their own path to survival.

    Secondly, it breaks the principle of statutory crime. Since the French Revolution, the general criminal laws of capitalist countries have adopted the "principle of statutory crime," that is, crimes and punishments must be handled in accordance with laws and regulations, and behaviors that are not expressly stipulated for punishment are not considered crimes. This was originally a product of the French Revolution, in which the bourgeoisie opposed the arbitrary actions of the royal family and nobles, "I am the state," on the one hand, and used it to deceive the people on the other. Today, the people and the government of the new China are united, and this principle cannot be adopted by ourselves, and at this moment, many of our laws and regulations are not yet complete, and the circumstances of counterrevolutionary crimes are so varied, and the types of behaviors that infringe on society are even more numerous. If we insist on the principle of statutory crime, wouldn't it be that sometimes we cannot deal with criminal behaviors that are clearly aimed at counterrevolution simply because there are no express provisions in the law? Especially today, when the revolutionary order and social order are still being established and consolidated, and domestic and foreign enemies, including imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, are carrying out sabotage activities against the people and the People's Government, when judicial work urgently needs to be strengthened, adopting the principle of statutory crime is undoubtedly detrimental to the people. Therefore, Article 16 of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries stipulates that "other crimes aimed at counterrevolution that have not been stipulated in these Regulations may be punished by analogy to similar crimes in these Regulations." In this way, general counterrevolutionary cases can be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries, that is, counterrevolutionary criminal acts that are not directly stipulated can also be handled according to the provisions of this regulation, according to the type of crime, by analogy to similar provisions. In this way, we don't have to worry about not being able to deal with counterrevolutionary crimes that are not stipulated; the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries can also achieve the greatest effect. From this, we can see a glimpse of the new spirit of criminal laws and regulations in the new China.

    This is the second characteristic of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries.

    Again, it adopts a policy of combining suppression and leniency. The spirit of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service" is implemented throughout the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries. In particular, Article 14 clearly stipulates: "Those who commit crimes under these Regulations and have one of the following circumstances may be given lenient, reduced, or exempted punishment at the discretion of the court: (1) those who voluntarily surrender to the People's Government with sincere remorse; (2) those who sincerely repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes before or after exposing and reporting; (3) those who are coerced or deceived by counterrevolutionaries and are indeed unwilling; (4) those whose counterrevolutionary crimes before liberation were not serious, and who have indeed repented and severed ties with counterrevolutionary organizations after liberation."

    This is a lenient measure to give counterrevolutionaries the opportunity to surrender, repent, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Those who are temporarily weak in willpower and are lured by counterrevolutionaries, or who join counterrevolutionary organizations due to the threat of counterrevolutionaries, will be treated leniently by the government; and those who are willing to join counterrevolutionary organizations but later know that they have repented and surrendered to the People's Government will also be given lenient treatment by the government.

    This is the third characteristic of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries.

    Finally, Article 18 of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries stipulates: "The provisions of these Regulations shall also apply to counterrevolutionary criminals before the implementation of these Regulations." This means that these Regulations have retroactive effect in terms of time limit. That is, anyone who has ever participated in counterrevolutionary activities, regardless of the length of time, as long as there has been counterrevolutionary behavior, these Regulations can be applied to him to the end. This indicates that the People's Government is adopting a long-term and thorough attitude of suppressing counterrevolutionaries.

    The basic characteristics of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries are roughly as described above.

    Lenin said: "The fundamental issue of all revolutions is the issue of state power" (On the Dual Power). The Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries are to guarantee the people's democratic dictatorship and are an effective legal weapon for safeguarding the regime. How can we achieve the effect of implementation? It depends not only on the public security and judicial cadres' ability to grasp the spirit of the law and handle cases flexibly, but also on the people's increased political awareness and their ability to exercise the right to expose and report counterrevolutionary criminals as stipulated in Article 19.

　　惩治反革命条例的几个特点
       郭名华
    中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例公布施行后，全国各地报章杂志纷纷发表社论、专论加以讨论，而且都把这个条例的政治意义讲得很清楚很明白了。这里，我想偏重以法律方面的观点，把惩治反革命条例的精神说一说，希望可以借此使得一般人民对于这个条例加多了解，引起重视。
    要想了解惩治反革命条例的精神（即其诸法条特点的总和），便不能不从这个法规中的基本特点去了解。惩治反革命条例的基本特点是什么呢？
    第一是具有鲜明的阶级性。马克思和恩格斯在共产党宣言中说过：“迄今存在过的一切社会的历史都是阶级斗争的历史。”法律是统治阶级的意志表现，亦即统治阶级的意识形态和道德观的具体表现。在阶级斗争中，法律起的作用很大；而刑事法规特别是这一惩治反革命条例，较之其他法律，更占着重要地位，因而它的阶级性也特别鲜明。此与资产阶级法律常常企图隐蔽其阶级性，以欺骗人民的绝不相同。我们的惩治反革命条例的阶级性表现在那里呢？这个条例的第二条说得最具体而明确，它说：“凡以推翻人民民主政权，破坏人民民主事业为目的之各种反革命罪犯，皆依本条例治罪。”这清楚地宣示了什么人是反革命分子，惩治反革命到底是为了什么。这个条例的公布，对于革命的人民来说，可以在法律思想上彻底划清敌我界线，并使司法干部有了对于反革命分子定罪科刑的正确标准，便能更有效地镇压反革命的活动，给人民民主政权以有力的保证。对于反革命分子来说，它也给了他们一个严重的警告，并指示其应走的道路：赶快向人民悔悟，否则必是自绝生路。
    其次是罪刑法定主义的打破。自法国大革命以来，资本主义国家的一般刑事法规都采取了“罪刑法定主义”，即是说，罪与刑均须依法规办理，行为无明文规定处罚的，即不认为犯罪。这本是法国大革命时，资产阶级一方面为反对皇室贵族“朕即国家”的胡作妄为，另方面以之欺骗人民的产物。今天，新中国的人民与政府是一致的，这个原则自己不能采取，而且此刻我国许多法规尚不完备，反革命犯罪情状是如此的千差万别，侵害社会行为的种类，更是多如牛毛。倘若一定固执罪刑法定主义，岂不是会有时对于明明以反革命为目的之犯罪行为，徒因法律上没有明文规定，我们就不能加以处理了吗？尤其在今天革命秩序和社会秩序尚在建立巩固当中，国内外敌人包括帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派，正在向人民和人民政府进行破坏活动，司法工作亟须加强的时候，如采取罪刑法定主义，无疑是对人民不利的。因此，惩治反革命条例第十六条规定，凡“以反革命为目的之其他犯罪未经本条例规定者，得比照本条例类似之罪处刑。”这样，一般的反革命案件，可以依据惩治反革命条例上的规定处理，即无直接明文规定的反革命犯罪行为，也可以根据这一条例的规定，依其犯罪的种类，比照相类似的条文处理。这样便可不愁对于没有规定的反革命罪行无法对付；镇压反革命工作也才可以收到最大的效果。由此可见新中国刑事法规新精神的一斑。
    这是惩治反革命条例的第二个特点。
    再次是采取了镇压与宽大相结合的政策。在惩治反革命整个条例中均贯彻了“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的精神。特别第十四条中更明确规定：“凡犯本条例之罪而有下列情形之一者，得酌情从轻、减轻或免予处刑：（一）自动向人民政府真诚自首悔过者；（二）在揭发、检举前或以后真诚悔过立功赎罪者；（三）被反革命分子胁迫、欺骗，确非自愿者；（四）解放前反革命罪行并不重大，解放后又确已悔改并与反革命组织断绝联系者。”
    这是给予反革命分子自首悔过立功赎罪的宽大措施，凡因一时意志力薄弱，为反革命分子所利诱，或因反革命分子的威胁而加入反革命组织的，政府给以宽大处理；又即甘愿加入反革命组织，但事后确知悔改而向人民政府自首的，政府也决定从宽处理。
    这是惩治反革命条例的第三个特点。
    最后，惩治反革命条例第十八条规定：“本条例施行以前的反革命罪犯，亦适用本条例的规定。”是本条例在时效上是有溯及既往的效力的。即任何曾经参加反革命活动，不问时间的久暂，只要有过反革命的行为，这个条例便可对他适用到底。这点表示人民政府对反革命分子是采取长期的彻底的镇压态度的。
    惩治反革命条例的基本特点，略如上述。
    列宁说：“一切革命的根本问题，就是国家政权问题”（论两个政权并存的局面）。惩治反革命条例便是保障人民民主专政的，是维护政权的有效的法律武器。如何可以收到施行的效果，固不仅系于公安、司法干部的善于掌握法律精神，灵活处理案件，而更有赖于人民的政治觉悟提高，善于行使第十九条所规定了的揭发、密告反革命罪犯的权利。
