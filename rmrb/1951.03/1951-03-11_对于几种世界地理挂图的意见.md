Opinions on Several World Geographical Wall Maps
        Zeng Ciliang

    (I) "New World Map" (Compiled by Guanghua Cartography Society, published by Sanlian Bookstore, first edition, February 1950)
    (II) "World New Situation Map" (Compiled by Lu Jieqing, printed by Fuxing Cartography Society, new edition, April of the same year)
    (III) "Arctic-Centered International New Situation Map" (Compiled by Fu Jiaojin, printed by Commercial Press, first edition, August of the same year)
    (IV) "Detailed World Situation Map" (Compiled and printed by Yaxin Geography Society, corrected first edition, October of the same year)
    (V) "World Political Situation Map" (Drawn by Yang Jingxiong, compiled and printed by World Knowledge Society, third edition, December of the same year)

    The above five maps are newly compiled medium-sized world geographical wall maps commonly used after liberation. I have read them separately and made a rough comparison and cross-check. I found that some of them still have some obvious errors in principle; some are basically good maps, but there are still some minor errors or inappropriate places. The former should be pointed out, and the latter may also be raised for correction. In addition, the "translation of names" and "arrangement direction of place names" on the map are also issues that the cartographic community should pay attention to; so they are also raised together later.

    In terms of drawing technology, the "World Political Situation Map" is better, and the other four maps are second-best. The "Arctic-Centered International New Situation Map" does not even include a legend, which is a major flaw.

    The most principled errors in the content of each map are found in the "World New Situation Map." In terms of country names: (1) Not only did it fail to mark "Democratic Republic" for the friendly country of Vietnam, but it also called it "Indochina" and included its English translation as French Indo China. (2) For Indonesia, it also used large characters to note its English translation as Dutch East Indies. (3) The translation attached to Taiwan does not use Taiwan but Formosa. In terms of national borders: (1) The national border between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union is drawn incorrectly; Kenmu Bichir and Gadada in the Tuva Autonomous Oblast of the Soviet Union are drawn into Mongolia; (2) The national border between India and Pakistan is drawn incorrectly; all of Kashmir is drawn into Pakistan. In terms of international affiliation: Although Libya in Africa is currently occupied by British troops, even British imperialism itself has not declared it a colony, but the map marks the word "British" in that area. In terms of national nature, in the attached maps: (1) Finland and Austria are classified into the category of New Democratic countries, without distinguishing them from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. (2) Yugoslavia is classified into the category of countries with "significantly increased Communist seats." (3) Vietnam is not classified into the New Democratic countries, but only classified into the category of "colonial national liberation movements led by the Communist Party," listed together with Myanmar and Indonesia. These should be corrected. There are also several errors in the "Arctic-Centered International New Situation Map" regarding borders: (1) In terms of coloring, the area near Manzhouli in Northeast China is drawn into the Soviet Union. (2) Burgun City in Xinjiang, China, is drawn into the Mongolian People's Republic. In addition, the Pamir and Ganju Tete, whose national borders have not been delineated, are completely drawn outside of China, which is also problematic. The "Detailed World Situation Map" draws Hekou in Yunnan, China, into Vietnam; the "World Political Situation Map" draws the Folyu Nansen Island of the Soviet Union as Norwegian territory on the attached map; these are also errors in terms of borders.

    Regarding cities: the design of city symbols in each map is also better in the "World Political Situation Map"; it uses forms such as "◎", "⊙", and "○" to represent the levels of city size (population size), and adds colored red dots or red "stars" to indicate their political status (capital or first city); this is a method that takes both aspects into account. Although there are no symbols to represent secondary political status cities (provincial capitals, etc.) in the map, such symbols seem to be omitted in world maps. This is a point that all maps can imitate and improve upon. In addition, the "Detailed World Situation Map" also uses colored red dots to indicate military ports, with a similar intention to the previous map; however, the meaning of the term "military port" in the common sense of the Chinese people is very unstable, and the differences in the symbols used to represent it may be very large. For example, in this map, Shanghai, Yongjia, Zhenhai, Xiamen, Tamsui, Yulin Port and other places in China are marked with military port symbols, but these places are not formal military ports now.

    The use of city symbols "◎", "⊙", "○", except for the "World Political Situation Map", all the maps inevitably have places where they "confuse their own examples" and misidentify them. For example, Shanghai and Nanjing are municipalities directly under the central government of our large administrative region, and Zhenjiang is a city under the jurisdiction of the Sunan Administrative Office. In the "Arctic-Centered International New Situation Map", these cities are marked with "⊙". Wuzhou, Nanning, and Guilin are all cities under the jurisdiction of Guangxi Province, and Nanning also serves as the provincial capital. However, the map uses "⊙" for Guilin and Wuzhou, and "○" for Nanning. For example, Kyoto, Japan, has a population almost twice that of Yokohama, but the "New World Map" marks Yokohama with the symbol "◎" for a first-class metropolis, and Kyoto with the symbol "⊙" for a second-class city; Wuhan and Chongqing in China are both municipalities directly under the central government of large administrative regions, and their populations are also over one million. The map marks Hankou with "◎", and Chongqing with "⊙". For example, Zhengzhou in Henan is a provincial-level city, and Luoyang is only a special district-level city, and its population is also smaller than that of Zhengzhou, but the "Detailed World Situation Map" marks Luoyang with "⊙", and Zhengzhou with "○". The "World New Situation Map" has more serious errors in the identification of capitals of various countries; the map uses "◎" for the capital of an independent country, and "⊙" for the first city of a colony or sub-country; but in Asia, it uses "◎" for Manila in the Philippines, and "⊙" for Batavia in Indonesia; it uses "◎" for Delhi in India, and only "○" (ordinary city symbol) for Karachi in Pakistan; in Africa, it uses "◎" for the capital of Liberia, and "⊙" for the capital of Abyssinia; in Europe, the capitals of the union republics within the Soviet Union are not marked with symbols for capitals or first cities, but only with ordinary city symbols. The above are just a few examples to show a glimpse, and there are really countless shortcomings of this kind in each map.

    In terms of transportation lines, the most problems in each map are the railways within China. In the "World New Situation Map", some routes are arbitrarily added to places where there are no railways or railways are being laid in China, such as Changsha to Guiyang, Yibin to Kunming, Chongqing to Chengdu, etc. The "Arctic-Centered International New Situation Map" also added lines between Zhangjiakou via Duolun to Chengde, between Wuhu and the Zhe-Gan Railway, etc., but did not draw the actual Shi-De, Shi-Tai and other railways. There are also one or two similar shortcomings in the other three maps.

    The depiction of rivers, lakes, and islands is also inconsistent in a few maps. The "Arctic-Centered International New Situation Map" draws a section of the upper reaches of the Yellow River into the northwest corner of Sichuan Province, probably based on a legend, but this seems to be insufficient. Macau is also drawn on an island at the mouth of the Yue River; the position of the Dongsha Islands also has a large deviation on this map. The "World Political Situation Map" omits the outlets of Dongting and Poyang Lakes, so that the two lakes are not connected to the Yangtze River on the map. Although this error seems very subtle, it should not be in the map.

    Among these five maps, two maps – the "World New Situation Map" and the "World Political Situation Map" – have attached prints of the national flags of various countries, which must also be mentioned. The national flags of various countries attached to the "World New Situation Map" are arranged without distinguishing between friends and enemies, and without any rules. The Soviet Socialist Republics Union is abbreviated as "Soviet", and the national flags of the two Democratic Republics of Vietnam and Germany are omitted; the national flags of Romania and Bulgaria are printed without the emblems on them; the scale of the Albanian flag and the emblems on it are incorrect; the emblem on the Hungarian flag is drawn out of shape; the white background and red star on the Korean flag are printed as white background, black lines, and red stars. The national flags attached to the "World Political Situation Map" also have many errors. It prints the German flag upside down; the blue color on some national flags is printed as purple, and the blue stripes on the Mongolian flag are printed as light blue. There may be other errors, which will not be listed one by one.

    The Chinese translation of foreign place names should of course be unified, but because there is currently no commonly recognized standard translation, there is still a phenomenon of multiple translations of one name in maps or newspapers. For example, Goa on the west coast of India is translated as "Guo A" in some of these five maps, "Guo Ya" in some, and "Ke Wa" in others; other readings mostly translate it as "Wo Ya". "The place names on each book must be unified with each other, and must be unified on a map." This should be the minimum requirement at present. Judging from this standard, the "World Political Situation Attached Map" does not meet the standard. Because there are only two small attached maps at the bottom of this map, there are several places where the translation names are inconsistent with the main map; such as "De Li Ya Si De" in Southern Europe, which is translated as "De Li Ya Si Te" in the attached map; "Ti Bi Li Xi" in the Soviet Union, which is translated as "Di Bi Li Xi" in the attached map; "Da Bu Li Shi" and "Ben De A Ba Si" in Iran, which are translated as "Da Bu Lie Zi" and "Ban Da A Ba Si" in the attached map; "Ba Sai Luo Na" in Spain, which is translated as "Ba Sai Luo Na" in the attached map. This situation of one name being translated in two ways also occasionally occurs in all readings, not only in maps, but it should be especially avoided on maps.

    The "World Political Situation Map" has many simple red overprinted texts, which are used to explain the current political situation of various countries or to mark the nautical miles between two places. This is an advantage. However, these additional texts are arranged vertically and horizontally; among the horizontal arrangements, some are left-aligned and some are right-aligned. There are three ways to read the text on a map, which is undoubtedly unreasonable. I think all the explanatory texts attached to the map should be changed to horizontal right-aligned (from left to right) to achieve unity.

    Finally, among these five maps, only the "Detailed World Situation Map" has the horizontal right-aligned arrangement of Chinese characters for place names, and the other four have horizontal left-aligned. This involves an important issue of the current "arrangement of Chinese characters for place names" on maps. At present, there are two opposing arrangement methods for place names on maps in China. The older one is horizontal left-aligned, and the newer one is right-aligned. The right-aligned arrangement method is consistent with the "reading direction" of foreign place names in the original language, and also consistent with the "reading direction" of numbers, which is a very convenient and reasonable method. In recent years, more and more mapmakers have switched to using right-aligned, but it has not been completely done, so there is currently a chaotic phenomenon in the arrangement of place names on various maps in China, which makes it very inconvenient for readers to refer to and compare. I hope that mapmakers will use the new right-aligned style when compiling new maps in the future, and also redraw old maps as much as possible when reprinting them.

    In general, taking the five wall maps discussed in this article as representatives, there are still many shortcomings in the drawing aspect. I hope that map compilers and publishers will improve them as much as possible, so that we can have a very perfect wall map. This is urgently needed today.

    Editor's note: In Mr. Zeng's article, he made some criticisms on the errors in facts, materials, and drawing techniques in several world wall maps. It should be pointed out that among these five maps, the "World Political Situation Map" is politically more correct and the drawing is better, and the "World New Situation Map" is the worst. On general world maps, in addition to the shortcomings and errors pointed out by Mr. Zeng, the most important thing is to list some countries and place names regardless of importance, and not to compile them according to certain requirements. We urgently need several world situation maps with accurate materials, compiled according to certain political purposes and target readers.

    Secondly, we have received letters from some readers, raising opinions on several other maps not included in Mr. Zeng's article, which need to be supplemented here. Comrade Zhou Kang from Tianjin pointed out that the "New World Political Map" published by Shanghai Fuxing Cartography Society in December 1950 (compiled by Lu Jieqing, drawn by Shentu Zhou, and proofread by Shao Yuechong) included Finland and Austria in the New Democratic countries, which is a principle error. The same error was pointed out by Comrade Mu Yi from Zhongyuan University in Wuchang: The "World Map" published by Yaguang Cartography Society in September 1950 and sold by Da China Bookstore (compiled by Ma Zongyao, and revised by Jin Qingyu) included Finland and Yugoslavia in the New Democratic countries; the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was not clearly delineated in the map, but was only generally referred to as Vietnam, with ANNAM (Annam) as an annotation, which are all serious errors.

    In addition, Comrade Song Zhirui from the Central South Military University in Hankou pointed out the error in the railway line of the Mongolian People's Republic on the map: A railway from Ulaanbaatar (Kulun) to Chaktu in the Soviet Union has not yet been built, but it is drawn on many maps; while a railway from Choibalsan (or Bayantumen, Kerulen) to the vicinity of Chita in the Soviet Union, which has actually been open to traffic for a long time, is not drawn on the map. The following maps published by Yaguang Cartography Society have such errors: the March 1950 edition, "Latest World Map" compiled by Ma Zongyao, "Map of the People's Republic of China" compiled by Jin Zhuquan and others, the April 1950 edition, "Pocket Latest World Map of National Fine Maps" and "Pocket People's Republic of China Provincial Fine Maps" compiled by Jin Qingyu, the September 1950 edition, "Latest World Map of National Maps" compiled by Ling Daxia. Also, the "New Map of the World Situation" published by Shanghai Continental Cartography Society in April 1950 and compiled by Zhang Wenqi also made the same mistake.

　　对于几种世界地理挂图的意见
        曾次亮
    （一）《新世界大地图》（光华舆地学社编三联书店发行一九五○年二月初版）
    （二）《世界新形势大地图》（陆洁清编  复兴舆地学社印行  同年四月新版）
    （三）《北极中心国际新形势图》（傅角今编  商务印书馆印行  同年八月初版）
    （四）《世界形势详图》（亚新地学社编印  同年十月订正初版）
    （五）《世界政治形势地图》（杨景雄绘  世界知识社编印  同年十二月三版）
    上列五种地图都是解放后新编的、一般常用的中型世界地理挂图。我把它们分别阅读并作一番粗略的参互对校，发现其中有的还存在着一些明显的原则性的错误；有的基本上不失为一种好图，但也还有若干小误或不甚妥适之处。对于前者固然应该指出，对于后者也不妨就所见到的地方提出来以便校正。还有，关于地图上的“译名”和“地名排列顺向”两事，也是舆图界应注意到的问题；所以也在后面一并提出。
    绘制技术方面，以《世界政治形势地图》为较好，其他四图较次。《北极中心国际新形势图》竟不载图例，是一大缺点。
    各图内容原则性的错误以《世界新形势大地图》为最多；在国名方面：（一）对友邦越南不但未标出“民主共和国”字样，且称之为“印度支那”，并附注其英文译名为French Indo China（法属印度支那）。（二）对印尼也以大字注其英译名为Dutch East Indies（荷属东印度）。（三）台湾附注的译名，不用Taiwan而用Formosa（福摩萨）。在国界方面：（一）蒙古人民共和国与苏联间的国界绘错；将苏联土伐自治州中的肯木毕其尔和加达都绘入蒙古境内；（二）印度与巴基斯坦间的国界绘错；将克什米尔全绘入巴基斯坦境内。在国际隶属方面：非洲的利比亚现在虽被英军驻占，但英帝国主义自己也未宣布其为殖民地，图中却于该地注“英”字。在国家性质方面，附图中：（一）将芬兰和奥地利并划入新民主主义国家一类，与波兰、捷克等国不加区别。（二）将南斯拉夫划入“共产党议席大增”一类的国家中。（三）不将越南划入新民主主义国家，而仅将其划入“共产党领导的殖民地民族解放运动”一类，与缅甸、印尼同列。这些都是应当改正的。《北极中心国际新形势图》中关于疆界的错误也有几处：（一）设色上将我国东北满洲里附近一带绘入苏联境内。（二）将我国新疆布尔根城绘入蒙古人民共和国境内。另外还将国界未经划定的帕米尔和干竺特完全绘在我国界外，这也是有问题的。《世界形势详图》将我国云南的河口绘入越南境内；《世界政治形势地图》在附图上将苏联的佛里求南森岛绘为挪威领土；这些也都是疆界方面的错误。
    关于城市：各图中城市符号的设计也以《世界政治形势地图》为较好；它用“◎”、“⊙”、“○”等形式来表示城市大小（人口多寡）的等级，另加套色的红点或红“星”以表示其政治地位（都城或首邑）；是双方兼顾的办法。虽然图中没有表示次等政治地位城市（省会等）的符号，但在世界地图中这类符号似还可以从略。这是各地图可以仿效并将其更加改进的一点。另外《世界形势详图》也用套色的红点表示军港，用意和前图相近；但军港一词在我国人民常识上的意义是很不固定的，用符号来表示它，则各图的出入可能很大。像本图中就将我国的上海、永嘉、镇海、厦门、淡水、榆林港等处都标上了军港符号，其实这些地方现在并不是正式的军港。
    城市符号“◎”、“⊙”、“○”的标用，除了《世界政治形势地图》以外，各图都不免有“自乱其例”、标识错误的地方。如上海、南京是我们的大行政区直辖市，镇江是苏南行署辖市，在《北极中心国际新形势图》中对于这些城市都用“⊙”作标识。梧州、南宁和桂林全是广西省辖市，南宁且兼为省会，该图中却对桂林梧州用“⊙”，对南宁用“○”。又如日本的京都人口多于横滨几达一倍，而《新世界大地图》却于横滨标以一等大都市的符号“◎”，于京都标以二等都市的符号“⊙”；我国的武汉和重庆都是大行政区直辖市，人口也都在百万以上，本图于汉口标以“◎”，于重庆标以“⊙”。又如河南的郑州是省辖市，洛阳仅是专署辖市，人口也少于郑州，而《世界形势详图》于洛阳标以“⊙”，于郑州标以“○”。《世界新形势大地图》对于各国都城的标识更有比较严重的错误；该图于独立国的首都用“◎”，于殖民地或子国的首邑用“⊙”；但在亚洲对菲律宾的马尼拉用“◎”，对印尼的巴达维亚却用“⊙”；又于印度的德里用“◎”，于巴基斯坦的喀喇蚩仅用“○”（普通城市符号）；在非洲于利比里亚的都城用“◎”，于阿比西尼亚的都城却用“⊙”；在欧洲对苏联境内各加盟共和国的都城也都不用首都和首邑符号，而仅以普通城市符号标识之。以上不过是略举数例以见一斑，各图中这一类的缺点实在是不胜枚举的。
    在交通线方面，各图中问题最多的是中国境内的铁路。《世界新形势大地图》中将我国境内还没有或正在铺设铁路的地方，任意添绘出好些路线，如长沙至贵阳，宜宾至昆明，重庆至成都等。《北极中心国际新形势图》中也添绘了张家口经多伦至承德间、芜湖与浙赣路间等线，却未绘出实有的石德、石太等铁路。其他三图这一类缺误也有一二。
    河流、湖泊、岛屿的绘出，少数图中也间有未合。《北极中心国际新形势图》将黄河上游的一段绘入四川省西北角，大概是根据一种传说，但这似乎是不足据的。又将澳门绘在粤江口的岛屿上；东沙群岛的位置在本图上也有很大的偏差。《世界政治形势地图》漏绘了洞庭鄱阳两湖的出水口，以致两湖在图上不与长江通连。这错误虽然好像很微细，但也是地图中所不应有的。
    在这五种地图中，有两种——《世界新形势大地图》和《世界政治形势地图》——附印了各国国旗，对于这一点，也须一说。《世界新形势大地图》附印的各国国旗，排列得敌友不分，毫无规律。且将苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟简称作“苏维埃”，并将越南和德意志两民主共和国的国旗漏掉；所绘罗马尼亚、保加利亚两国国旗，把上面的徽帜印漏了；阿尔巴尼亚国旗的比例尺和上面的徽帜都不正确；匈牙利国旗上的徽帜绘制得不成样子；朝鲜国旗上的白底、红星印成了白底、黑线、红星。《世界政治形势地图》附印的国旗同样有很多错误。它把德国国旗印倒了；有若干国旗上的蓝色被印成了紫色，蒙古国旗上的蓝条又被印成浅蓝色。其余的错误可能还有，不一一列举。
    关于外国地名的汉文译名，当然是应该统一的，但因目前还没有共同承认的标准译名，所以在地图或书报上都还存在着一名数译的现象。如印度西岸的Goa，在这五种图上有的作“果阿”，有的作“果亚”，有的作“疴袜”；其他的读物中却多作“卧亚”。“每一种图书上的地名总须自相统一，在一幅图上更须统一”，这应该是目前最低限度的要求。拿这个标准来看，《世界政治形势附图》就有未合。因为本图下方只有两小块附图，而其中的译名就有几处与正图不一致；如南欧的“的里雅斯德”，附图作“的里雅斯特”；苏联的“梯比里西”，附图作“第比里西”；伊朗的“大不里士”和“本得阿巴斯”，附图作“大不列兹”和“班达阿巴斯”；西班牙的“巴塞罗那”，附图作“巴塞罗纳”。这种一名两译的情形在一切读物中也间或有之，不仅地图为然但在地图上更应当特别避免。
    《世界政治形势地图》上附有不少红色套印的简单文字，用来说明各国的政治现势，或标示两地间的航程海里数。这是一个优点。但这些附加的文字有竖排的，有横排的；横排之中又有的左行，有的右行。一幅图上文字的读法竟有三种，其不合理是无待言的。我以为一切地图上附印的说明文字应全改用横排右行（自左而右），以求统一。
    最后，这五幅图中地名的汉字排列顺向，只有《世界形势详图》一种是横排右行的，其他四种都是横排左行。这涉及目前地图上“地名汉字排列方式”的一个重要问题。目前我国地图上的地名有两种排列方式对立，较旧的是横排左行，较新的是右行。右行的排列法既可与外国地名原文的“读向”一致，又与数码的“读向”一致，实在是很方便合理的办法。近年制图界改用右行的已经日见其多，但还没有完全照这样做，所以目前国内各种地图在地名排列上存在着一种紊乱现象，使读者在参阅比对上非常不便。我希望今后制图家在编制新图时能一律用右行新式，旧图在重版时也尽可能重绘。
    总的说来，以本文所讨论的五幅挂图为代表来看，在绘制方面还存在着许多缺点，希望地图编绘者、出版者尽可能改进，使我们能有一幅很完善的挂图。这是今天迫切需要的。
    编者按：曾先生这篇文章中，就几种世界挂图中事实、材料与绘制技术上的错误作了些批评。应该指出，这五种地图中，《世界政治形势地图》是在政治上较正确，绘制也比较好的，《世界新形势大地图》最差。在一般世界地图上，除曾先生所指出的缺点和错误外，最主要的是不分轻重地罗列一些国家与地名，不根据一定的要求来编辑。我们迫切的需要几种材料确实，按照一定的政治目的与读者对象编绘的世界形势地图。
    其次，我们曾经接到有些读者来信，对没有包括在曾先生文章里的另外几种地图提出意见，在这里需要作一个补充。天津周抗同志指出上海复兴舆地学社一九五○年十二月出版的《新世界政治大地图》（陆洁清编，申屠周绘，邵越崇校）把芬兰和奥地利列入新民主主义国家，是一个原则错误。同样一个错误，是武昌中原大学穆毅同志指出的：亚光舆地学社一九五○年九月出版、大中国图书局经售的《世界大地图》（编制者马宗尧，校订者金擎宇）将芬兰和南斯拉夫列入新民主主义国家；图中未将越南民主共和国明确划出，只笼统地称为越南，用ANNAM（安南）作为附注，都是严重的错误。
    此外，汉口中南军大宋之瑞同志来信指出地图上对于蒙古人民共和国的铁路线的错误：从乌兰巴陀（库伦）通到苏联恰克图的一铁路尚未筑成，但在很多图上画上了；而实际早已通车的乔巴山（或称巴音土们、克鲁伦）至苏联赤塔附近的一条铁路，在地图上却没有画出。亚光舆地学社出版的下列地图都有这样的错误：一九五○年三月版、马宗尧编《最新世界大地图》，金竹泉等编《中华人民共和国大地图》，一九五○年四月版、金擎宇编《袖珍最新世界分国精图》和《袖珍中华人民共和国分省精图》，一九五○年九月版，凌大夏编《最新世界分国地图》。还有上海大陆舆地社一九五○年四月出版、张文起编的《世界现势新地图》也同样搞错。
