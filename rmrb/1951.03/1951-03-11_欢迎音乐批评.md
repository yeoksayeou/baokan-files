　　To the Music Criticism Editor:
    I have always enjoyed music and often read articles about it. Because I love to sing, I pay particular attention to song reviews. Recently, I read Comrade Zhou Weizhi's "A Brief Discussion on the Creation of Songs Praising Chairman Mao" in the *People's Literature*, and I was very satisfied with it. Later, I read Comrade Sun Shen's "Some Tendencies in the Creation of Songs for Resisting America and Aiding Korea," and I felt it was also quite right. I think this kind of criticism is very good. It can help people who don't understand music but like it—like me—to critically look at a song, what makes a good song, and what makes a not-so-good song, and strengthen our correct understanding of songs. I hope that this kind of article will appear frequently in the *People's Literature* in the future. I also hope that the *People's Literature* will publish some good songs, fresh and powerful songs of the masses, songs that highly combine political content and artistry. This will not only make it easier for the masses to sing but also serve as a demonstration. I also hope that those comrades with songwriting experience will create more songs that are timely and meet the needs of the moment, as the masses have a very urgent need for good songs.
    Also, if there are too many good songs that are too long to be published in full in the *People's Literature*, can you introduce them to us and tell us the names of the songs, authors, and publishers? It would be best to introduce them frequently and in a timely manner.

专栏：读者来信

　　欢迎音乐批评编辑同志：
    我一向是比较喜欢音乐的，我常常看一些关于音乐的文章。因为爱唱歌，所以对歌曲评论就比较注意，最近在《人民文艺》上登过一篇周巍峙同志的《略谈歌颂毛主席的歌曲创作》，我看了以后很满意。后来又看了孙慎同志的《抗美援朝歌曲创作中的某些倾向》，我觉得说得也挺对。我认为这样的批评是很好的，它能帮助不懂音乐又喜欢音乐的人——如我——批判地去看一个歌，怎样是个好歌，怎样是个不太好的，并加强我们对歌的正确认识。我希望以后能经常有这类的文章出现在《人民文艺》上，我还希望以后在《人民文艺》上能刊登些好的歌，新鲜的有力的群众的歌，高度的政治性与艺术性结合的歌。它不但能便于群众歌唱，还会起些示范作用。我还希望那些有作曲经验的同志多多地应时地创作些歌来，群众对好歌的要求是很迫切的。
    还有，如果好歌太多太长不能全登在《人民文艺》上，那么能不能给我们介绍出来，告诉我们歌的名字，作者，出版处呢？最好能经常地及时地介绍。
