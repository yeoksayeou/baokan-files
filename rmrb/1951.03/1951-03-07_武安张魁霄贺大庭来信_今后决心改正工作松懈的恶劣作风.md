Wu'an Zhang Kuixiao He Dating Letter:
    Determined to Correct the Bad Work Style of Slackness in the Future

To the Editor:
    We sincerely accept Comrade Guo Qin's criticism in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 4th regarding the loss of a large number of cotton bales due to poor management in our cooperative. We have conducted a rigorous examination and self-criticism of our careless work style. The responsible parties have been given demerits. We are determined to change our past bad work style of ideological paralysis and slackness in future work, and to establish a responsible attitude towards the property of the people.
