Reaction to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

　　Zhang Zhimian of the Jixian County Third District Women's Federation
    Self-Criticizes for Casually Assigning Tasks and Lacking a Mass Perspective

Editor:

    I sincerely accept the criticism published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 11th, "It is necessary to prohibit the random assignment of tasks to the masses." This mistake is a specific manifestation of my lack of a mass perspective. Therefore, I am making the following self-criticism.

    The course of events was as follows: On January 27th, I, along with Geng Boxiang, the cultural and educational assistant of our district, and Wang Fengxiu, a cultural instructor, went to the Hengshui Commissioner's Office to attend the "Workers' and Peasants' Education Conference." Because I had to attend meetings in two villages along the way, and because my own bicycle riding skills were not good and I couldn't carry the luggage, I asked the district head and clerk to find a way to send my luggage there no matter what. That evening, I arrived at the Hengshui County Democratic Women's Federation and saw that the luggage had not been delivered. Estimating that I couldn't reach the county today, I stayed at a friend's house. I should be completely responsible for this matter personally, because Comrades Geng Boxiang and Wang Fengxiu did not know about the request for a vehicle.

    For my personal needs, I disregarded the difficulties and interests of the masses, and wasted the manpower and material resources of the masses for three pieces of luggage, which is wrong; especially making the peasant who provided the vehicle freeze all night, unattended, is an intolerable error. The emergence of this mistake is by no means accidental; it is a specific manifestation of my lack of a mass perspective. In addition to accepting the readers' criticism of me, I am determined to strengthen my mass perspective, not repeat the mistake, and apologize to the fellow villager who was left out in the cold.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　冀县三区妇联张治绵
    检讨自己随便派差  缺乏群众观点的错误编辑同志：
    人民日报二月十一日“读者来信”栏内发表了“要禁止向群众乱派差”的批评，我诚恳接受。这个错误是我没有群众观点的具体表现，为此，我特作以下的检讨。
    事情的经过是这样：一月二十七日，我和本区文化教育助理员耿伯翔、文化教员王凤修同去衡水专员公署参加“工农教育会议”。因为在中途我要参加两个村的会议；并且自己骑自行车的技术不好，行李带不动，所以我向区长及事务员要求，无论如何想法把我的行李送去。当晚，我到了衡水县民主妇女联合会，一看行李没有送到，估计今天不能到县，所以我就住在朋友家了。这件事应由我个人完全负责。因为要车的事耿伯翔、王凤修二同志并不知道。
    我为了个人的需要，不重视群众的困难和利益，为了三件行李而浪费了群众的人力物力，这是不应该的；特别是使出车的老百姓，冻了一夜，无人照管，更是不能容忍的错误。错误的产生绝不是偶然的，这是我缺乏群众观点的具体表现。我除了接受读者对我的批评，决心加强群众观点，不再重犯错误外，并对受冻的老乡道歉。
