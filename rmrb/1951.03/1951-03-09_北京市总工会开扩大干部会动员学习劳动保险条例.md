　　Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Holds Expanded Cadre Meeting to Mobilize Study of the Labor Insurance Regulations

　　On the afternoon of March 5th, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions held an expanded cadre meeting to mobilize all cadres to earnestly study the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the Government Administration Council. More than 380 people attended the meeting, including union chairmen and labor insurance committee members from 63 public and private enterprise units with more than 100 employees, as well as cadres from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and 15 district trade union offices. At the meeting, Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Song Ting, Minister of Labor Insurance, and Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, explained in detail the purpose, characteristics, and great significance of implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations. They also focused on reporting the situation of labor insurance work in Beijing in the past and how to specifically implement it in the future. Thirty-five units of factories and mines with more than 100 people in the city have already allocated insurance funds, and 41 enterprise units have clinics, which partially solves the difficulties of employees. However, the payment ratio and expenditure methods are extremely inconsistent. At the same time, based on the experience of implementing the Trade Union Law after its promulgation, Beijing will first launch a study movement of the regulations. The study of cadres will gradually deepen into the working masses to avoid detours; it will also improve trade union work, strengthen the work of the labor insurance department, register the age and seniority of members, and establish and improve a scientific management system, supplement and adjust cadres, and clarify the division of labor to overcome the chaos in labor insurance work. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions directly runs training classes to specifically study the regulations. Song Ting, Minister of Labor Insurance, emphasized at the meeting that in the past, some enterprise administrations and capitalists had the wrong view of confusing labor insurance with labor protection and welfare undertakings. They believed that it was "canceling small welfare and implementing large welfare," "canceling unreasonable and implementing reasonable." As a result, there was a phenomenon that after paying labor insurance money, they generally ignored it, or even reduced or canceled existing welfare undertakings, which aroused worker dissatisfaction. This idea of ​​"labor protection package" is wrong. But at the same time, we must also prevent some workers from making excessive demands and must proceed from realistic and possible conditions. In a free speech, Lu Jingping, a female worker from the private Renli Carpet Factory, used her personal experience to expose the hypocrisy of the capitalists' "labor insurance" before liberation. She said, "I am a worker in a private factory. After the 'July 7th' Incident, the factory also implemented 'insurance,' stipulating that only if a person died in the factory, the direct relatives of the deceased could receive a little coffin money. Workers are only treated for illnesses in the factory, and once they leave the factory, they are not cared for. Female workers are not allowed to return to the factory after they get married." Workers from the Mentougou Coal Mine said after listening, "We used to suffer disasters, but we are not afraid anymore. We will get five feet of red cloth when we have children, which is really a double happiness." Zhang Chonghui, deputy director of the Tap Water Union, said: "When we conveyed the regulations, the whole venue was silent. The workers listened to every word and sentence of the regulations. We have almost memorized the articles. The opinions we raised before have been adopted and implemented by the government (such as meal allowances for injuries on duty and retirement issues)." Ling Biying, an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike, said: "There was such a clause when fighting against the reactionary warlords in the past. The reactionaries said that if your conditions were met, the 'country' would be 'poor'. However, shortly after the mainland was liberated, the People's Government promulgated regulations and began to implement the major issue of labor insurance, which is related to the vital interests of workers across the country. This is true insurance. In the past, some people relied on their sons to support them in their old age, which was not completely reliable. The conservative ideas caused by the concern of teaching technology to apprentices and starving the masters can be completely broken." He excitedly said to everyone: "The goal of our struggle for more than 20 years has now been realized before my own eyes." All the participating cadres were full of confidence that they would immediately launch a study after returning and carry out the necessary preparations to ensure that the Labor Insurance Regulations would be officially implemented on this year's "May Day".

　　北京市总工会开扩大干部会动员学习劳动保险条例
    北京市总工会于三月五日下午，召开了全市扩大干部会议，动员全体干部认真学习政务院公布的劳动保险条例。到会有百人以上的各公营、私营六十三个企业单位的工会主任、劳动保险委员，和市总工会及十五个区工会办事处干部三百八十余人。会上由市总工会副主席刘莱夫同志、劳动保险部长宋汀同志及市人民政府劳动局马光斗副局长详细解释了实行劳动保险条例的目的、特点及其伟大意义。他们又着重报告了京市过去对于劳动保险工作情况及今后如何具体实施等问题。全市百人以上的厂矿已有三十五个单位拨付了保险金，有四十一个企业单位有医疗所，部分解决了职工的困难。但支付比例，开支方法极不统一。同时鉴于工会法颁布后执行的经验，北京市将首先展开对条例的学习运动。由干部的学习逐步深入到工人群众中去，避免多走弯路；并将健全工会工作，加强劳动保险部门工作，进行会员年龄与工龄的登记，以及建立与健全科学的管理制度，补充调整干部，明确分工，以克服劳动保险工作的混乱现象。市总工会直接开办训练班，专门进行条例的学习。劳动保险部长宋汀同志在会上强调指出：过去有某些企业行政与资方把劳动保险与劳动保护、福利事业混为一谈的看法是不对的，他们认为是：“取消小福利，实行大福利”、“取消不合理的，实行合理的。”因之，曾产生了支付劳动保险金后便一概不管，甚至减少或取消了已有的福利事业现象。引起了工人不满。这种“劳保包”的思想是错误的。但同时也要防止某些工人过高的要求，必须从现实的可能的条件出发。在自由发言中，私营仁立地毯厂女工吕静平以切身经验揭发了解放前资本家“劳动保险”的虚伪性。她说：“我是私营工厂的工人。‘七七’事变后，工厂中也实行过‘保险’，规定人死在工厂，才能由死者的直系亲属领一点点棺材费。工人病在工厂里才给治疗，出厂一概不管。女工结了婚，就不许回厂。”门头沟煤矿工人听了都说“以前竟遭难，以后不怕了，生了孩子还得五尺红布，真是双喜临门。”自来水工会副主任张崇惠说：“我们传达条例时，全场鸦雀无声，工人们把条例的每个字、每句话都听到耳朵里去了。我们对条文快背下来了。以前我们提的意见，政府都采纳实行了（如因公负伤伙食费与退职问题）。”曾参加“二七”工人大罢工的老工人凌必应说：“过去和反动派军阀作斗争时就有这一条。反动派说，答应了你们的条件，‘国家’就‘穷’了。可是大陆解放不久，人民政府就把关系到全国工人切身利益的劳动保险大问题，便颁布条例开始实行了。这是真正的保险。过去有人指望着儿子养老，那是不完全可靠的。由于把技术教给学徒，饿死师傅的顾虑，而产生的保守思想，可以完全打破了。”他兴奋地向大家说：“我们二十多年的斗争目标，现在我亲眼看到实现了。”与会全体干部充满信心，要在回去后马上展开学习，并进行必要的准备工作，以保证劳动保险条例于今年“五一”正式开始执行。
