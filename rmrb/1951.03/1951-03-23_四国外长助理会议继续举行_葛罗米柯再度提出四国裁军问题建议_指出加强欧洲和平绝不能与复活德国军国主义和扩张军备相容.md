　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 20th: The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting continued on March 19th, chaired by French representative, Parodi.

　　American representative Jessup spoke first. He repeated stale "arguments," insisted on opposing the Soviet proposal, and shamelessly questioned the sincerity of the Soviet Union's intentions. He tried his best to quibble for the US, British, and French governments' violation of the Potsdam Agreement, and slanderously accused the Soviet Union of violating this agreement. British representative Davies repeated Jessup's anti-Soviet slanders in his speech, and boasted about the "advantages" of the Western Three Powers' proposal.

　　Soviet representative Gromyko exposed the lies and slanders that the Three Powers' representatives frequently used in the meeting to defend their proposals. Gromyko denounced Jessup's slander that the Soviet delegation wanted to achieve some purpose unrelated to the holding of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He said: The Soviet delegation came here to attend the meeting precisely because the Soviet government raised the issue of holding the Foreign Ministers' Conference in its note. The Soviet government's serious attitude towards this issue can be proved by the draft agenda proposed by the Soviet delegation, which includes two of the most important and urgent issues - the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on the eradication of German militarism and the reduction of the four countries' troops.

　　Gromyko continued: Jessup vaguely mentioned the "June incident of 1950" (i.e., the US intervention in Korea that began in June 1950, which was later disguised under the banner of the United Nations) to justify the position of the Three Powers' representatives. However, the essence of this incident shows that the United States, which has been carrying out an arms race for many years, has moved from preparing for aggression to direct acts of aggression. The lesson of this incident proves that the agenda proposed by the Three Powers is incorrect, while the draft agenda of the Soviet delegation is appropriate, especially the item on the reduction of the four countries' troops.

　　Gromyko said: In an attempt to deceive public opinion, the Western countries fabricated the slander that the Soviet Union violated the Potsdam Agreement by establishing troops in the German Democratic Republic, to justify their policy of violating the Potsdam Agreement and reviving German militarism. He cited detailed historical facts to prove that the Western countries violated the obligations they assumed in the Potsdam Agreement. Gromyko then quoted the original text of the Soviet government's note to the British government on February 24th of this year, refuting Jessup's malicious slander that the Soviet Union violated its treaty obligations to Yugoslavia, pointing out that it is not the Soviet Union that threatens the national interests of Yugoslavia, but the Yugoslav rulers who are trying to subordinate the national interests to the interests of their US and British masters.

　　In conclusion, Gromyko said: The discussions in each meeting further prove that the Three Powers' delegations want to prevent the Foreign Ministers from discussing the urgent issues of eradicating German militarism and reducing the four countries' armaments proposed by the Soviet delegation. The Soviet delegation believes that the wording of its proposal on March 14th is completely correct.

　　The next meeting is scheduled for March 20th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 21st: The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting held its 14th meeting on March 20th, chaired by British representative Davies.

　　Soviet representative Gromyko spoke first, summarizing the work of the past two weeks. He pointed out: Because the Soviet delegation was forced to agree to replace the clear wording in the Soviet delegation's proposal on accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing the occupying forces stationed in Germany based on the treaty with the wording proposed by the Western Three Powers' delegations in order to strive for an agreement, the meeting has reached an agreement on one item of the agenda, which is: "The question of restoring the unity of Germany and preparing a peace treaty with Germany." The Soviet delegation's desire is to strengthen peace in Europe. However, it is regrettable that the Western Three Powers have insisted on opposing the Soviet proposal on the eradication of German militarism and the reduction of the four countries' troops.

　　Gromyko continued: The new wording of the agenda proposed by the Soviet delegation on the 14th included the main proposal of the Three Powers' delegations - namely, the issue of the causes of international tension in Europe. The intention of the Soviet proposal is to enable the Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss all the issues that each of the four countries considers most important for maintaining peace in Europe. However, the ambiguous proposal of the Western Three Powers to "study the level of armaments" is not for the purpose of reducing armaments but for allowing the Three Powers to freely carry out further expansion of armaments. This may be in the interests of certain groups in certain major countries, but it violates the fundamental interests of the people and the interests of maintaining peace. The Soviet delegation cannot agree to the Three Powers' proposal, which aims to prevent discussion of the most urgent issue of the four countries' disarmament, nor can it agree to exclude the issue of implementing the Potsdam Agreement on the eradication of German militarism from the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference at a time when the threat of the revival of German militarism looms over Europe. The Soviet delegation is convinced that its position on the issue of reducing the four countries' troops has been and will continue to be welcomed by all people who uphold peace.

　　Gromyko said that the movement of the broad masses of the people, especially the people of European countries, against the policy of reviving German militarism proves the extreme importance of the issue of the four countries fulfilling their obligations to eradicate German militarism. However, the proposals of the Western Three Powers not only do not guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations assumed by the US, Britain, and France, but on the contrary, allow the Three Powers to freely carry out the work of Germany's re-militarization. Gromyko further pointed out that the proposal to convene the Foreign Ministers' Conference is to discuss the most important and urgent issues closely related to the people of all countries, and to strengthen peace in Europe; however, strengthening peace in Europe is absolutely incompatible with the revival of German militarism and the further expansion of armaments by major powers. Historical facts have proven that the expansion of armaments and the revival of German militarism can only lead to the outbreak of a new war. The people of European countries have learned lessons from Hitler's aggression, so they demand an end to the arms race, the reduction of the four countries' troops, and the prevention of the revival of German militarism.

　　Gromyko continued: On the issue of fulfilling existing treaty obligations raised by the Three Powers' representatives, the Soviet delegation believes that there is no need to raise this point. However, in order to make it more likely to reach an agreement on the agenda issue, the Soviet delegation proposed the following new wording for this item: "Consider the causes of the existing international tension in Europe, as well as the measures necessary to ensure a genuine and lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, including the reduction of troops of the US, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, the establishment of international supervision for the implementation of the troop reduction, and other measures to eliminate the threat of war and the fear of aggression, as well as the issue of fulfilling existing obligations in the four countries' treaties and agreements." The Soviet delegation hopes that this revised proposal, which takes into account the wishes of the Three Powers' representatives, will be approved by the Three Powers' representatives.

　　Subsequently, French representative Parodi spoke, expressing that he could not agree to include the issue of the four countries' disarmament in the draft agenda. He shamelessly declared that the French government believes it is necessary to "make some efforts in terms of armaments." British representative Davies supported Parodi's speech. After Gromyko reiterated in his reply to the French and British representatives that the four countries' disarmament is in the interest of international peace, American representative Jessup and British representative Davies spoke. Their speeches once again proved that they do not want the Foreign Ministers to consider the urgent issues of eradicating German militarism and the four countries' disarmament, because the Western countries are implementing a policy of expanding armaments and re-militarizing Germany.

　　Jessup, Davies, and Parodi stated that they would study the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation at today's meeting.

　　The next meeting is scheduled for March 21st.

### 四国外长助理会议继续举行  葛罗米柯再度提出四国裁军问题建议  指出加强欧洲和平绝不能与复活德国军国主义和扩张军备相容

    四国外长助理会议继续举行
    葛罗米柯再度提出四国裁军问题建议
    指出加强欧洲和平绝不能与复活德国军国主义和扩张军备相容
            十九日会议
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：四国外长助理会议三月十九日继续开会，由法国代表巴罗第任主席。
    美国代表耶塞普首先发言。他重复陈腐的“论据”，坚持反对苏联的建议，并无耻地怀疑苏联的意图是否真诚。他竭力为美英法三国政府的违反波茨坦协定作诡辩，诬蔑苏联违反这个协定。英国代表戴维斯在发言中重复了耶塞普的反苏谰言，并夸耀西方三国建议的“优点”。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯揭穿了三国代表经常在会议上用来替他们的建议辩护的谎言和诬蔑。葛罗米柯痛斥耶塞普关于苏联代表团想要达到与召开外长会议毫不相干的某种目的的谰言。他说：苏联代表团之所以到这里来开会，正是因为苏联政府在其照会中提出了召开外长会议的问题。苏联政府对这一问题的郑重态度，可以从苏联代表团所提出的包括两项最重要、最迫切的问题——履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定和裁减四国军队——的议程草案中得到证明。
    葛罗米柯继称：耶塞普隐隐约约地提到“一九五○年的六月事件”（即一九五○年六月开始的美国对朝鲜的干涉，这一干涉后来又用联合国的旗帜掩饰起来）来为三国代表国的立场辩解，但是，这个事件的本质说明：多年来一直在进行扩军运动的美国，已由准备侵略走到直接的侵略行动。这一事件的教训，证明了三国建议的议程是不正确的，而苏联代表团的议程草案是适当的，特别是关于裁减四国军队一项。
    葛罗米柯说：西方国家为了企图欺骗舆论，凭空捏造苏联违反波茨坦协定在德意志民主共和国建立军队的谰言，替自己违反波茨坦协定恢复德国军国主义的政策辩解。他列举详尽的史实，证明西方各国违反了在波茨坦协定中所承担的义务。葛罗米柯随后援引苏联政府本年二月二十四日致英国政府照会中的原文，驳斥耶塞普关于苏联违反对南斯拉夫的条约义务的恶意诽谤，指出威胁南斯拉夫民族利益的不是苏联，而是竭力想把民族利益从属于美英主子的利益的南斯拉夫统治者。
    葛罗米柯在结语中说：每一次会议中的讨论都更能证明，三国代表团想阻止外长们讨论苏联代表团所提出的肃清德国军国主义和裁减四国军备的迫切问题。苏联代表团认为它在三月十四日建议的措辞是完全正确的。
    下次会议定于三月二十日举行。
            二十日会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十一日讯：四国外长助理会议于三月二十日举行第十四次会议，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯首先发言，总结了两周来会议的工作。他指出：由于苏联代表团为力求取得协议而不得已而同意以西方三国代表团建议的措辞代替苏联代表团建议中关于加速缔结对德和约并根据和约撤退驻德占领军的明确措辞，会议已在议程的一个议案上达成协议，这就是：“关于恢复德国的统一与准备对德和约的问题”。苏联代表团的愿望在于加强欧洲的和平。但是，令人遗憾的是：西方三国代表对于苏联关于肃清德国军国主义和裁减四国军队的建议坚持反对。
    葛罗米柯继称：苏联代表团十四日建议的议程的新措辞包括了三国代表团的主要建议——即关于造成欧洲国际紧张局势的原因的问题。苏联建议的用意是要使外长会议把四国中每一国家认为对于保持欧洲和平最为重要的一切问题都加以讨论。而西方三国含糊其辞的“研究军备水平”的建议，却不是为了裁减军备而是为了使三国得以放手进行更进一步的扩张军备。这也许符合某些大国的某些集团的利益，但是却违反了人民的基本利益，违反了维持和平的利益。苏联代表团不能同意旨在阻止讨论四国裁军这样最急迫的问题的三国建议，也不能同意在德国军国主义复活的威胁笼罩着欧洲的今天，不把履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定问题列入外长会议议程。苏联代表团深信它在裁减四国军队问题上的立场得到了、并将继续得到一切拥护和平的人们的欢迎。
    葛罗米柯说，广大人民、特别是欧洲各国人民反对恢复德国军国主义的政策的运动，证明了四国履行肃清德国军国主义的义务的问题具有极端的重要性。但是，西方三国的建议不仅没有保证履行美、英、法所承担的义务，而且恰恰相反，使三国得以放手进行德国的重新军国主义化的工作。葛罗米柯进一步指出：建议召开外长会议是为了商讨与各国人民密切相关的最重要最迫切的问题，是为了加强欧洲的和平；然而，加强欧洲的和平，与德国军国主义的复活，与各大国进一步扩张军备，是绝不相容的。历史的事实证明，扩张军备与恢复德国军国主义只能导向新战争的爆发。欧洲各国人民已从希特勒的侵略中获得了教训，因此他们才要求停止扩张军备运动，裁减四国军队，并防止德国军国主义的复活。
    葛罗米柯继称：在三国代表所提出的关于履行现有条约的义务的问题上，苏联代表团认为没有提出这一点的必要，然而为了在议程问题上更有可能取得协议，苏联代表团提出这项议案的新措辞如下：“考虑欧洲现存国际紧张局势的原因，以及为保证苏、美、英、法间关系真正而持久的改善所必需的措施，其中包括裁减美、苏、英、法四国军队，建立实施裁减军队的国际监督，和其他消除战争威胁与对侵略的恐惧的措施等问题，以及履行四国条约与协定中现有义务问题。”苏联代表团希望这一经过修改的、照顾到三国代表愿望的建议，将得到三国代表的赞同。
    随后，法国代表巴罗第发言，表示不能同意议程草案中包含四国裁军问题。他无耻地声言，法国政府认为有必要“在军备方面作某种努力”。英国代表戴维斯支持巴罗第的发言。在葛罗米柯答复法英两国代表时重申四国裁军符合于国际和平的利益以后，美国代表耶塞普和英国代表戴维斯发言。他们的发言再度证明：他们是不要外长们考虑肃清德国军国主义与四国裁军这种紧迫的问题的，因为西方国家正在执行着扩张军备与使德国重新军国主义化的政策。
    耶塞普、戴维斯和巴罗第表示将研究苏联代表团在本日会议上所提出的建议。
    下次会议定于三月二十一日举行。
