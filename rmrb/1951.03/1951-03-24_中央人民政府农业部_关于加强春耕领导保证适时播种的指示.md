　　Instruction of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on Strengthening Spring Ploughing Leadership and Ensuring Timely Sowing

　　I. Doing a good job in spring ploughing is the decisive key to completing this year's agricultural production tasks. The central task of spring ploughing is to ensure timely sowing. Strictly adhering to the sowing time and timely sowing are the basic guarantees for a bumper harvest. In order to ensure timely sowing, it is first necessary to accurately complete the preparatory work, strengthen supervision and inspection, and ensure that farmers deliver manure, prepare land, prepare seeds, repair farm tools, and repair canals, wells, and ponds as scheduled. For the difficulties existing among the masses, we must provide specific help to solve them: for families of martyrs, soldiers, and staff members who lack labor, we must organize cultivation on their behalf; in disaster areas, we should mobilize and organize the masses to rationally use disaster relief grain and loans, and use methods such as mutual assistance and mutual borrowing to solve the difficulties of lacking seeds, farm tools, and livestock. In areas where land reform is currently underway, land reform should be concluded immediately and turned to production; the fruits of victory should be used for production as much as possible; land certificates should be issued as soon as possible to consolidate farmers' confidence in loving the land. In special product areas such as cotton and tobacco, where the masses need a large amount of fertilizer and fuel, transportation should be organized and supplied in a timely manner. In areas where livestock epidemics occur, efforts should be concentrated on eliminating them and protecting livestock power. At present, spring ploughing has already begun, and we must resolutely oppose the laissez-faire phenomenon in some areas and mobilize urgently.

　　II. Strengthen labor mutual assistance and improve technology. Only by implementing organization can we better improve and enhance technology, exert labor efficiency, and increase production. In old areas, labor mutual assistance should advocate a sound democratic system, solve the existing problems of mutual aid groups, enrich new content, and consolidate and develop on the existing basis. In new areas, "on the basis of the original mutual assistance habits of the local masses, and according to the principle of voluntary equivalence, appropriate organization should be carried out; but forced orders must be opposed," create typical examples, and then promote them. At present, we should focus on organizing various small mutual aid groups in order to complete spring ploughing and sowing in a timely manner. Technically, the current first requirement is deep ploughing, fine harrowing, repairing side dikes, improving soil, selecting seeds, disinfecting seeds, and preventing underground pests; and advocating centralized fertilization, and gradually implementing strip sowing in areas with the habit of broadcasting. The improved seeds stored by the government are required to be disinfected and checked for germination efficiency before being handed over to farmers. For newly promoted varieties, the characteristics of the varieties and cultivation methods must be told to farmers to avoid losses.

　　III. Resolutely ensure the completion of the planting plans for cotton, hemp, and tobacco. This year's production tasks for cotton, hemp, flue-cured tobacco, and other products are particularly heavy. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has issued instructions on the price ratio of cotton and grain, hemp and grain, and all localities should deeply publicize and resolutely implement them. In particular, pre-purchase and advance purchase should be carried out on a large scale, contracts should be signed with farmers to dispel farmers' concerns, improve farmers' production enthusiasm, and ensure the completion and strive to exceed the predetermined plan. In areas with a good work foundation, on the basis of mass voluntariness, it is required that more than half of the cotton contracts be signed, which is the most effective way to ensure the completion of the production increase task. At the same time, these crop-producing areas should be used as the focus to lead farmers to formulate production plans, so that farmers can formulate specific and realistic plans on the basis of understanding national policies. The sowing period of cotton is very short, so seeds, fertilizers, etc. must be prepared first. The north often has spring droughts, so we must do a good job in advance in well drilling and canal excavation to ensure that the plan can be completed as scheduled under any circumstances.

　　IV. Ensure to increase the yield per unit area of wheat. After last year's bumper harvest, people's living standards have improved and the demand for wheat has increased, so production must be increased this year. This requires that wheat fields should at least be hoeed once and more topdressing should be applied. Where conditions permit, spring water should be watered; in areas with more water accumulation, ditches should be dug for drainage to protect wheat seedlings. The bumper harvest of wheat is the first sound of the whole year's bumper harvest, and it is extremely important, so it should be guaranteed to be completed first.

　　V. The National Agricultural Work Conference decided to launch the patriotic production increase campaign. Li Shunda Mutual Aid Group, a labor model in Shanxi, took the lead in responding and challenged the national mutual aid groups. Local labor model mutual aid groups have begun to respond, and there will inevitably be a wider response in the future. All localities should start from the current spring ploughing and sowing work, and on the high tide of the enthusiastically launched movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, mobilize them to discuss Li Shunda's plan, formulate the production plans of mutual aid groups, villages, and households, and organize the vast number of farmers into the upsurge of the patriotic production movement.

　　At present, the spring ploughing season has arrived, and many areas have organized cadres to go to the countryside for inspection, which is very important. We ask all levels of people's governments to immediately conduct in-depth inspections, discover problems in a timely manner, solve problems, promote the spring ploughing movement, and resolutely ensure that timely sowing is achieved, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

　　中央人民政府农业部
    关于加强春耕领导保证适时播种的指示
    一、做好春耕工作是完成今年农业生产任务决定的关键。春耕工作的中心任务，就是保证适时播种。严格地遵守播种时间，及时下种，是丰收的基本保证。为了保证适时播种，首先必须准确完成准备工作，加强督促检查，使农民如期送粪、整地、准备种子、修补农具，修整渠道、水井、塘坝。对于群众存在的困难，要具体帮助解决：对无劳力的烈士军人工作人员家属，要很好地组织代耕；在灾区，应发动和组织群众合理地使用赈粮和贷款，并以互助互借等方法，解决种子、农具、牲畜缺乏的困难。现正进行土地改革的地区，应立即结束土地改革转入生产；尽量把胜利果实用于生产；尽早发给土地证，以巩固农民热爱土地的信心。棉、烟等特产区，群众需要大量肥料、燃料，应组织调运，及时供给。牲畜疫病发生的地区，应集中力量扑灭，保护畜力。目前，春耕已经开始，应坚决反对某些地区的自流现象，紧急地动员起来。
    二、加强劳动互助、提高技术。只有实行组织起来，才能更好地改进和提高技术，发挥劳动效能，增加产量。劳动互助，在老区提倡健全民主制度，解决互助组存在的问题，充实新的内容，在现有基础上巩固与发展。新区“在当地群众原有的互助习惯的基础上，根据自愿等价原则，加以适当的组织；但须反对强迫命令”，创造典型，再行推广。目前应着重组织各种小型互助组，以便及时完成春耕播种。技术上当前首先要求深耕、细耙，修边垒堰，改良土壤，选种换种，进行种子消毒，防除地下害虫等；并提倡集中施肥，撒播习惯地区逐渐实行条播。政府所存换的良种，要求一律经过消毒和检查发芽效率后，再交给农民。新推广的品种，必须把品种特性、栽培方法告诉农民，以避免损失。
    三、坚决保证完成棉、麻、烟的种植计划。今年棉、麻、烤烟等生产任务特别繁重，政务院财政经济委员会已经颁布了棉粮、麻粮比价的指示，各地应深入宣传，坚决贯彻执行。特别要大量实行预购、赊购，与农民订立合同，解除农民顾虑，提高农民生产情绪，保证完成并争取超过预定计划。工作基础较好的地区，在群众自愿的基础上，要求能有半数以上的棉花订立合同，这是保证完成增产任务最有效的办法。同时并应以这些作物产区为重点，领导农民制订生产计划，使农民在了解国家政策的基础上，定出具体确实的计划来。棉花的播种期很短，必须先把种子、肥料等准备妥当。北方经常春旱，更要将打井、开渠等工作事先做好，保证在任何情况下，一定能如期完成计划。
    四、保证提高小麦的单位面积产量。去年丰收后，人民生活提高，小麦需要量增大，今年必须要求增产。这就要求麦田至少应做到普锄一遍，多施追肥。有条件的地方要浇上春水；积水多的地方，实行挖沟排水，保护麦苗。小麦的丰收是全年丰收的第一声，关系极重，应首先保证完成。
    五、全国农业工作会议决定开展爱国丰产运动。山西劳动模范李顺达互助组首先响应，并向全国互助组提出了挑战，各地劳动模范互助组已开始应战，今后必然会有更广泛的响应。各地要从当前春耕播种工作出发，在热烈开展着的抗美援朝运动的高潮上，发动他们讨论李顺达计划，制定互助组、村、户的生产计划，把广大农民组织到爱国生产运动的热潮中来。
    目前，春耕季节已经到来，不少地区已组织干部下乡检查，这是很重要的。我们要求各级人民政府，立即进行深入的检查，及时发现问题，解决问题，推动春耕运动，坚决保证做到适时播种，打下全年丰收的基础。
