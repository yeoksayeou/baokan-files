The Ministry of Public Health of the Central People's Government
    Instruction on Organizing and Promoting "Tissue Therapy"
    Since 1933, when Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences academician Filatov advocated the clinical application of "tissue therapy," significant and positive medical results have been obtained through research and improvement. The Soviet Ministry of Health has called on the entire country to adopt it.
    In our country, it was first tested at the Northeast China Medical University in 1948; since then, Harbin, Shenyang, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an and other places have successively researched and applied it, and have also obtained many results and experiences, proving that "tissue therapy" is indeed a great invention in the modern medical field, suitable for the needs of the broad masses of the people, and is possible to promote under the current technical conditions in our country. Therefore, in order to conscientiously promote this treatment method, the Ministry of Public Health of the Central People's Government hereby issues the following instructions, hoping that health administrative organs at all levels and their affiliated medical institutions will earnestly organize research and implementation.
    First, health administrative organs at all levels in major and medium-sized cities across the country should hold symposiums on "tissue therapy," inviting medical personnel who have research and practical clinical experience in "tissue therapy" to report and discuss promotion methods. It is also necessary to regularly supervise and inspect the implementation of its affiliated units, summarize experience, and widely introduce it. Units or individuals with outstanding achievements should be commended.
    Second, the Central Institute of Health, medical colleges and universities across the country, and teaching hospitals (or hospitals with suitable conditions) should serve as research and promotion centers for "tissue therapy." They should be responsible for guiding and assisting other hospitals in theoretical study, technical training, and the manufacturing and supply of organized materials to widely adopt it; when there is considerable work experience and conditions permit, short-term training courses for physicians should be held to cultivate talent. Outpatient departments and sanatoriums in small and medium-sized hospitals can first establish research societies or research promotion groups to gradually experiment and apply; and establish contact with various research centers.
    Third, medical workers' associations, the Chinese Medical Association, the Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles and other medical organizations at all levels should hold academic reports on "tissue therapy" to promote it widely. When possible, specialized committees should be organized to be responsible for promotion and supervision.
    Fourth, various health and medical journals and publications should focus on publishing theoretical works on "tissue therapy," clinical reports, and translations of new theories and methods continuously published by the Soviet Union on "tissue therapy." At the same time, hospitals that adopt this therapy should accurately record the actual operating methods, effects, experiences, creations, and new discoveries in the adoption process, summarize and statistics them in a timely manner, report them to the superior health authorities, and introduce them in publications.
    Conscientiously organizing and promoting "tissue therapy" should be regarded as the beginning of learning Soviet medicine, and also the beginning of health administrative organs improving medical methods in an organized and guided manner. Attention should be paid to overcoming the conservative views in the minds of some medical personnel, and rewarding the absorption of new academic knowledge and inventions. Health departments in major administrative regions and provincial and municipal health authorities must vigorously organize, support and promote this work, and report the implementation status to the ministry on a quarterly basis.

　　中央人民政府卫生部
    关于组织推行“组织疗法”的指示
    自一九三三年苏联医药科学院院士费拉托夫提倡临床应用“组织疗法”以来，经过研究改进已获得了显著的良好的医疗效果。苏联保健部曾号召全国采用。
    我国自一九四八年起首先在东北中国医科大学试用；此后，哈尔滨、沈阳、北京、天津、上海、西安等地前后相继研究应用，亦获得不少的效果与经验，证明“组织疗法”确是近代医学界中的一种伟大发明，适合于广大人民的需要，在我国目前的技术条件下是可能推广的。因此，为了认真推行此一治疗方法，中央卫生部特发布以下的指示，希望各级卫生行政机关及其所属医疗机构，切实组织研究执行。
    第一、全国各大、中城市各级卫生行政机关，应召开关于“组织疗法”的座谈会，邀请对“组织疗法”有研究与有实际临床经验的医务人员进行报告及讨论推行办法。并要经常督促检查其所属单位的执行情况，总结经验，广为介绍，成绩优良的单位或个人，应予以表扬。
    第二、中央卫生研究院，全国各医学院校，以及教学医院（或有条件的医院）应作为“组织疗法”的研究中心与推广中心，要负责在理论学习上，技术训练上，与组织材料的制造供应上，指导协助其他医院，广泛采用；在已具有相当的工作经验而条件可能时，应举办医师短期训练班以培养人才。中小医院门诊部、疗养院可先成立研究会或研究推广小组，逐步地实验应用；并与各研究中心取得联系。
    第三、各级医务工作者协会、中华医学会、医药界联合会等医学团体应举办关于“组织疗法”的学术报告会，广泛宣传，可能时应组织专门委员会，负责推广督导。
    第四、各种卫生医药杂志、刊物应有重点地刊载“组织疗法”的理论著作，临床报告，以及译述苏联关于“组织疗法”继续发表的新理论、新方法，同时各医院采用此一疗法应详确记录采用过程中实际操作方法、效果、经验、创造与新发现，及时总结统计，层报上级卫生机关，并在刊物上介绍。
    认真组织与推行“组织疗法”应视为学习苏联医学的开端，也是卫生行政机关有组织地、有领导地改进医疗方法的开端，要注意克服某些医务人员思想上保守观点，奖励吸收新学术与发明创造。各大行政区卫生部、省市卫生机关，必须大力组织支持与推行这一工作，并将执行情况按季报部。
                                            中央人民政府卫生部
                                             一九五一年三月三日
