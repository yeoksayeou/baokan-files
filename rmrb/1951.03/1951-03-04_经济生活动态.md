    The General Administration of Customs Issues Provisional Measures for the Collection of Customs Fees

    The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government issued "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Customs Fees" on February 26th. According to the principles of simplifying procedures and reasonable burden, the measures stipulate that customs fees are divided into four categories and eighteen items. The four types of fees are special supervision fees, special cargo inspection fees, registration and license renewal fees, and visa fees. The customs fee is the fee charged by the customs for international or coastal transport vessels when the customs needs to carry out supervision and inspection work outside the customs-designated location and time. Before liberation, there were many types of customs fees. For example, the Shanghai Customs alone had 49 types and 110 items of fees.
            
    Shandong Linglong Gold Mine Completes Tunnel Ahead of Schedule

    In mid-November of last year, workers from a mine tunnel at the Shandong Linglong Gold Mine, after receiving the task of opening a 56-meter-long tunnel, immediately launched a patriotic production competition with unparalleled labor enthusiasm. Although the work was carried out on the snow-covered mountain top, and the accommodation and food were difficult, the miners' production enthusiasm remained high, and production efficiency continued to increase, from 0.25 cubic meters per work shift to 0.305 cubic meters. As the New Year was approaching, the miners shouted "Make another effort and get through the tunnel for the New Year!" and finally completed the task half a month ahead of schedule on January 3rd of this year. With the tunnel open, the previous waste of manpower and resources in transporting ore from the bottom up through nine layers has also disappeared.
            
    Northeast Bank's Savings Business Develops Rapidly

    In the past year, the savings business of the Northeast Bank has developed extremely rapidly. According to statistics at the end of last year, the Northeast Bank had approximately two million depositors, and the total deposits absorbed throughout the year reached 1.1 trillion yuan (Northeast currency, same below), completing 111% of the original plan, an increase of 750% compared to 1949. The rapid development of the Northeast Bank's savings business illustrates the rapid improvement of people's lives. In the spring of last year, the Northeast Bank began to conduct salary deduction savings in various places in a step-by-step manner. From June, it also started prize-winning savings, and after the autumn harvest, it was promoted to the vast rural areas. In December, the Northeast Bank implemented capital and value guarantees for various fixed-term savings deposits. This year, the Northeast Bank plans to increase savings deposits by at least five times compared to last year. To this end, the bank plans to establish savings institutions in various places, conduct various service-oriented businesses, and combine collection, payment, and salary distribution to attract the savings of the majority of employees and citizens; at the same time, it will also organize mobile teams to go deep into rural areas and urban units to absorb savings deposits.

    The Wanbei Production and Disaster Relief Headquarters is now planning to mobilize disaster victims to actively participate in the Huai River management work before the wheat harvest, plant early-maturing crops, and vigorously organize disaster victims to engage in sideline production, which can enable disaster victims to obtain about 500 million catties of grain. At present, 42 oil mills in the Fuyang interplanting area of Wanbei have resumed production. The townships and villages of Huaiyin and Yancheng Prefectures in Subei have successively held cadre meetings and disaster victim representative meetings to formulate production and disaster relief plans for their respective regions.

    海关总署发布海关征收规费暂行办法
    中央人民政府海关总署于二月二十六日发布“海关征收规费暂行办法”。该项办法根据简化手续、合理负担的原则，将海关规费规定为四种十八项。四种规费为特别监管费、特别查验货物费、注册换证费、签证费。按规费是海关对国际航行船舶或沿海运输船舶在海关规定地点和时间以外需海关执行监管和查验工作时所收的费用。解放前海关规费种类繁多，如上海海关即有四十九种一百零一项规费。
            山东玲珑金矿提前打通坑道
    去年十一月中旬，山东玲珑金矿某矿洞工人在接受了打通全长五十六米坑道的任务后，立即用无比的劳动热情展开了爱国主义生产竞赛。工作虽是在冰天雪地的高山顶上进行的，住宿和饮食的情况也很困难，但矿工同志的生产情绪依然高涨，生产效率不断上升，每工从挖通零点二五立方米提高到零点三零五立方米。将要过年时，矿工们喊出“再努一把力，打通坑道过新年”，终于今年一月三日提前半月完成任务。打通了坑道，以前矿石必须从底下向上经过九层运出的浪费物力人力的现象也从此绝迹。
            东北银行储蓄业务迅速发展
    一年来，东北银行的储蓄业务发展极为迅速。据去年年底统计：东北银行拥有储户约二百万户，全年吸收存款达一万一千亿元（东北币，下同），完成原定计划百分之一百十一，较一九四九年增加了百分之七百五十。东北银行储蓄业务的迅速发展，说明人民生活的迅速改善。东北银行在去年春天开始在各地有步骤地举办了工薪折分储蓄。六月份起又开始举办有奖储蓄，秋收后更推行到广大农村。到十二月间，东北银行又将各种定期储蓄存款实行保本保值。今年东北银行计划吸收储蓄存款至少比去年增加五倍。为此，该行拟在各地普设储蓄机构，举办各种服务性的业务，结合代收、代付、代发薪资等工作，以争取广大职工、市民的储蓄；同时并组织流动小组，深入农村及城市各单位吸收储蓄存款。
