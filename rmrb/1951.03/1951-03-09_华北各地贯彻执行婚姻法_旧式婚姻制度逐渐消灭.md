　　The implementation of the Marriage Law in various parts of North China by governments at all levels has achieved results. Countless new and happy families have been formed and are being established. According to statistics from 178 villages in Huailai County, Chahar Province, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, among 400 marrying couples, over 300 couples married with mutual consent and the approval of their parents. In the second half of last year, 430 young men and women in Zuoquan and Heshun counties, Shanxi Province, married independently. In Raoyang County, Hebei Province, more than one hundred and twenty young men and women married independently within a month of the promulgation of the Marriage Law. Some widows who had been suppressed by feudal public opinion also chose partners and married independently.

　　Facts from various places prove that the implementation of the Marriage Law is an important factor in promoting production and harmonizing families. After Wang Miaozhen and Mi Zengshou in Damo Village, Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, married independently, the man went out to do business while the woman worked in the fields. The masses praised them, saying, "Independent marriage is really good; both men and women are satisfied." Li Erfeng of Miaokou Village, Qixian County, Pingyuan Province, organized the whole family to weed wheat in the fields a few days after her free marriage, and also intensified her studies during production breaks. The whole family gets along well and engages in production, filled with a happy and pleasant atmosphere. Facts educate the masses, making them gradually realize the benefits of the Marriage Law. Some older people have also changed their thinking, saying, "This method is good; it's a lifelong matter for the children, and they should handle it themselves."

　　The implementation of the Marriage Law has gradually eliminated the old marriage system, and the old marriage views and selection criteria of young men and women have also changed. Women have gradually overcome the dependent idea of "marrying a man to get clothes and food," and instead consider good labor and a willingness to make progress as conditions for finding a partner. Some women in Linxian County, Pingyuan Province, requested three conditions from their partners when they married: first, to agree to participate in winter school and people's school; second, to agree to participate in meetings; and third, to agree to participate in mutual aid groups. A woman in the seventh district of Yuci County, Shanxi Province, married a poor peasant, and some backward people ridiculed her for marrying a poor man. She said, "In the new society, as long as you are willing to work, there is a way." The mother of Er Guinv, a female worker at the Taiyuan Cigarette Factory, said, "Let my daughter find a progressive partner; the working class is so glorious!"

　　Another gain from the implementation of the Marriage Law is the liberation of many men and women who were bound by the feudal marriage system; the chaotic phenomena and suicidal tragedies of men and women caused by lack of freedom of marriage have also gradually decreased. Within five months of the promulgation of the Marriage Law in Chahar Province, the courts adjudicated 4,600 divorce cases, more than 80% of which were filed by women who could not bear the pain caused by unreasonable marriages. In areas where the publicity of the Marriage Law is relatively thorough, district and village cadres can generally grasp the spirit of the Marriage Law and reasonably resolve marital disputes. For example, in Pinggu and Changping counties in Hebei Province, the district and village resolved 127 marriage cases in September last year alone.

　　The reform of the marriage system must go through a patient and long-term anti-feudal ideological struggle to achieve complete success. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, in some areas, due to insufficient understanding of the Marriage Law by cadres and their failure to carry out in-depth publicity and education of the Marriage Law to the masses, restrictions on freedom of marriage or reckless divorce phenomena still exist in some areas. The people's governments and democratic women's federations in these areas have paid attention to studying these problems and deviations and have summarized the experience of implementing the Marriage Law over the past year to educate cadres and the masses, so that the Marriage Law can be further implemented.

### 华北各地贯彻执行婚姻法  旧式婚姻制度逐渐消灭

　　华北各地贯彻执行婚姻法
    旧式婚姻制度逐渐消灭
    华北各地各级人民政府贯彻执行婚姻法已获得成绩。无数新型的幸福家庭已经形成和正在建立中。据察哈尔省怀来县一百七十八个村的统计，自婚姻法公布后，四百对结婚的男女中，双方自主自愿并经过父母同意的有三百多对。山西省左权、和顺两县在去年下半年中，有四百三十对青年男女自主结婚。河北省饶阳县在婚姻法公布后一个多月，就有一百二十对青年男女自主结婚。有些一向在封建舆论压抑下的寡妇，也选择了对象自主结婚。
    各地事实证明，婚姻法的实施是推动生产和使家庭和睦的重要因素。山西省崞县大莫村王妙珍与米增寿自主结婚后，男的跑外做买卖，女的下地劳动，群众都称赞说：“自主结婚真好，男女都称心如意。”平原省淇县庙口村李二凤自由结婚后没几天，就组织全家下地锄麦，在生产空隙还加紧学习。全家和睦搞生产，充满幸福愉快的空气。事实教育群众，使他们逐渐认识到婚姻法的好处。有些老年人思想也转变了，说“这办法就是好，孩子们一辈子的事，应该让他们自己办。”
    婚姻法的实行，使旧的婚姻制度逐渐消灭，青年男女间旧的婚姻观点和选择对象的条件也有所改变。妇女中逐渐克服了“嫁汉为了穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想，而以劳动好、肯进步为寻找对象的条件。平原省林县有些妇女在结婚时，要求对方答应三个条件：一是同意参加冬学、民校，二是同意参加会议，三是同意参加互助组。山西省榆次县七区一个妇女与一贫农结婚，个别落后群众讥笑她嫁了个穷汉。她说：“新社会里只要肯劳动，就有办法。”太原市卷烟工厂女工二闺女的母亲说：“让俺女儿也找个进步的对象吧，工人阶级多光荣！”
    婚姻法实施中的另一收获是解放了不少为封建婚姻制度所束缚的男女；由于婚姻不自由而产生的男女混乱现象与自杀悲剧也逐渐减少。察哈尔省自婚姻法公布后五个月内，经法院判决的离婚案件达四千六百件，其中百分之八十以上是妇女不堪忍受不合理婚姻所造成的痛苦而提出的。在婚姻法宣传比较深入的地方，区、村干部大都能掌握婚姻法的精神，合理解决婚姻纠纷。如河北省平谷、昌平两县，仅去年九月份经区、村解决的婚姻案件即达一百二十七起。
    婚姻制度的改革必须经过耐心的和长期的反封建思想斗争才能得到完满的成绩。婚姻法颁布后，部分地区由于干部对婚姻法认识不足，没有把婚姻法的精神深入地向群众进行宣传教育，所以限制婚姻自由或轻率离婚现象仍在部分地区存在。这些地区人民政府与民主妇女联合会已注意研究了这些问题与偏差，并总结一年来执行婚姻法的经验，以教育干部与群众，使婚姻法得到进一步的贯彻。
