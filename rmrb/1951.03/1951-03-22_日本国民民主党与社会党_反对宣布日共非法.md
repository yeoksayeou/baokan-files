　　Japanese National Democratic Party and Socialist Party
    Oppose Declaring the Japanese Communist Party Illegal
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] News: The Yoshida reactionary clique's plot to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal has even been opposed by bourgeois opposition parties. According to Kyodo News, when Agriculture and Forestry Minister Hirokawa Kozen met with Tomabechi Gizō, chairman of the Supreme Committee of the National Democratic Party, on the 16th, requesting that the party and the Liberal Party jointly submit a "Communist Party Illegalization Bill" to the Diet, Tomabechi immediately replied: "Unless there are reasons that convince the people, I personally cannot immediately agree." On the 17th, the National Democratic Party held a general meeting of its Diet members to discuss the attitude toward the Liberal Party regarding the issue of illegalizing the Japanese Communist Party. The meeting decided to refuse to support the Liberal Party and lodged a "serious protest" with the Liberal Party. On the same day, the chairman of the party's General Affairs Committee, Sakurauchi, and the Deputy Secretary-General, Shiiguma, lodged a serious protest with the Deputy Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Ozeki Giichi, based on the decision of the meeting.
    At the same time, the Yoshida group's conspiracy was also opposed by the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party issued a statement on the 17th stating: "The Socialist Party opposes any attempt to declare the Communist Party illegal at this time." The statement also attacked the Yoshida group's attempt to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal for the sake of local elections as a "shameless act."

　　日本国民民主党与社会党
    反对宣布日共非法
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：吉田反动集团企图宣布日共为非法的阴谋，甚至遭到资产阶级在野党派的反对。据共同社讯，当农林相广川弘禅于十六日会见国民民主党最高委员会主席苫米地义三，要求该党与自由党联合向国会提出“共产党非法化案”时，苫米地当即答称：“假使并没有使国民信服的理由的话，我个人现在不能马上赞成。”十七日，国民民主党召开该党国会议员大会，讨论对自由党关于日共非法化问题的态度。大会决定拒绝支持自由党，并对自由党提出“严重抗议”。当天下午，该党总务委员会主席樱内及副干事长椎熊即根据大会的决议向自由党副干事长尾关义一提出了严重抗议。
    同时，吉田集团的阴谋也遭到社会党的反对。社会党于十七日发表声明称：“社会党反对在这一时刻宣布共产党为非法的任何企图”。声明并攻击吉田集团为了地方选举而企图宣布日共非法是“无耻的行动”。
