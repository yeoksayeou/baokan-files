　　Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea: News Roundup
    The Central-South Region Launches Enthusiastic Movement to Oppose U.S. Arming of Japan
    The movement of people from all walks of life in the Central-South Region against the U.S. arming of Japan is now in full swing. As of March 18th, according to incomplete statistics, more than two million people in over a hundred cities and some rural areas in the region have held parades and demonstrations against the U.S. arming of Japan. On International Women's Day, March 8th, nearly one million women from places like Xuchang and Zhengzhou alone held parades and demonstrations. On March 18th, over 200,000 workers and their families from Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, as well as business and industry representatives from Wuhan and members of the True Jesus Church in Hubei, held parades and demonstrations. Including those who participated in rallies and demonstrations for Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea, there are now over three million people in the region who have participated in rallies and parades.
    Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in Jinan and Qingdao, Shandong
    In Jinan and Qingdao, Shandong, the people's patriotic enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and new atmospheres have emerged in various tasks through the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement.
    The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in Jinan has spread to all strata of the city, and the political awareness of the broad masses has been greatly improved. Over 20,000 employees from 49 units in the city have participated in patriotic production competitions. The renovation movement of the Catholic Church has also made headway. Some Catholics in church schools have openly criticized their past reactionary ideas of "preferring to be American dogs rather than Chinese." Elderly people over 60 among the Hui people have also participated in parades. The broad masses of women have also been organized. Business and industry actively pay taxes. Cadres in government agencies have generally established patriotic covenants, improving work efficiency. The main shortcomings currently existing in the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in the city are that the propaganda and education for scattered street residents and farmers in the suburbs are not enough, and the implementation of patriotic covenants by all sectors has not been promptly inspected and supervised.
    In Qingdao, over 130,000 people participated in the large-scale demonstrations in the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement. Many white-haired old people participated in the parades and demonstrations. The number of young students who signed up to join military cadre schools accounted for more than 30% of all students of suitable age. 50,000 workers from public and private enterprises participated in patriotic production competitions. Other sectors have also actively participated in the patriotic movement.

　　抗美援朝动态
    中南区反对美国武装日本的运动热烈展开
    中南区各界人民反对美国武装日本的运动现正热烈展开。迄三月十八日止，据不完全统计，该区已有百多个城市和部分农村共二百万以上的人民举行了反对美国武装日本的游行示威。“三八”国际妇女节，仅妇女界即有许昌、郑州等地近百万人举行游行示威。三月十八日，开封、郑州等地工人及其家属，武汉市工商界及湖北真耶稣教徒共二十余万人分别举行游行示威。连同举行抗美援朝爱国集会和示威游行的人数在内，该区现已有三百万以上的人民参加集会游行。
    山东济南青岛两市的抗美援朝运动
    山东济南、青岛两市，经过抗美援朝运动，群众的爱国热情空前提高，各项工作出现了新的气象。
    济南市的抗美援朝运动已发展到全市各个阶层，广大群众的政治觉悟大为提高。全市已有四十九个单位的两万多职工参加爱国生产竞赛。天主教的革新运动也打开了局面。教会学校中的教徒有的公开批评了自己过去“愿当美国狗，不做中国人”的反动思想。回民中六十岁以上的老人也参加了游行。广大妇女也组织起来了。工商界踊跃纳税。机关干部普遍订立了爱国公约，提高了工作效率。该市抗美援朝运动现存的主要缺点是对分散的街道居民和市郊农民的宣传教育还不够，对各界执行爱国公约的情况没有进行及时检查督促。
    青岛市在抗美援朝运动中仅市内参加大示威的群众即有十三万人以上。许多白发老人都参加了游行示威。报名参加军事干部学校的青年学生占全部适合年龄的学生的百分之三十以上。公私企业中有五万工人参加了爱国生产竞赛。其他各界也都积极地参加到爱国运动中来了。
