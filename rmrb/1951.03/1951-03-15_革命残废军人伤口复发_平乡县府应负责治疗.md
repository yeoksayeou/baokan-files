    Revolutionary Disabled Soldier's Wound Recurrence
    Pingxiang County Government Should Be Responsible for Treatment
    Editor:
    I am a first-class revolutionary disabled soldier and cannot walk. I live alone. In September 1948, my wound flared up. I sold three mu of land to treat the wound myself. In July 1950, my wound flared up again. To this end, I sent two letters to the Civil Affairs Section of this county (Pingxiang County, Hebei Province), but received no reply. Later, I wrote to Comrade Xie of the CCP County Committee (he was my old superior during the War of Resistance Against Japan). He wrote a letter to the Civil Affairs Section for me, and the Civil Affairs Section agreed to treat my wound. I treated it at home for seventeen days and the wound healed, but the Civil Affairs Section did not pay the medical expenses. Now the hospital is asking me for money, but I have no way to pay and the Civil Affairs Section does not care.
    My house has no door, and the Civil Affairs Section promised to install one for me, but it has not been installed yet. The Bureau of Veteran Affairs sent a letter to the Civil Affairs Section for this purpose, but the Civil Affairs Section still refuses to install it for me. It has been snowing for several days now, and I still have no door.

    Editor's Note: When the wounds of revolutionary disabled soldiers recur, the government should refer them to public hospitals for free treatment. If the situation described in Comrade Li Gendong's letter is true, the Pingxiang County Civil Affairs Section's lack of concern for revolutionary disabled soldiers should be corrected.

### 革命残废军人伤口复发  平乡县府应负责治疗

    革命残废军人伤口复发
    平乡县府应负责治疗
    编辑同志：
    我是一个一等革命残废军人，不能走路。家中只有我一个人。一九四八年九月，我的伤口发了。我卖了三亩地自己治好了伤口。一九五○年七月，我的伤口又发了。为此，我曾先后给本县（河北省平乡县）民政科去了两封信，没有答复。以后我又向中共县委会谢同志（他是抗日战争时我的老首长）去信。他替我写了一封信给民政科，民政科才答应替我治伤口。我在家治了十七天，伤口治好了，但民政科却没付医药费。现在医院向我要钱，我没有办法，民政科也不管。
    我家里没有门，民政科曾答应给我按一扇，但至今也没有按。荣誉军人管理局为此曾给民政科去信，民政科还是不给我按。现在雪下了好几天，我还是没有门。
            平乡县三区马第二町  李根东
    编者按：革命残废军人伤口复发时，政府应介绍至公立医院予以免费治疗。如果李根东同志来信所申诉的情况属实，平乡县民政科对革命残废军人不关心的态度，是应当纠正的。
