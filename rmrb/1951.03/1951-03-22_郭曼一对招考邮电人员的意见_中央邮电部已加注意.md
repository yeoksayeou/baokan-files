    Guo Manyi's Opinions on Recruiting Postal and Telecommunications Personnel
    The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Has Paid Attention
    To the Editor:
    Having seen the opinions of Comrade Guo Manyi on our ministry's recruitment of postal and telecommunications personnel published in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on February 12th, we now reply as follows:
    Since its establishment, although our ministry has established a unified national postal and telecommunications organization, a unified national system for recruiting and employing personnel is still being studied and formulated. Comrade Guo's opinions are very good, and our ministry will pay attention to them when formulating this system in the future.
                        General Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government

    郭曼一对招考邮电人员的意见
    中央邮电部已加注意编辑同志：
    看到二月十二日贵报“读者来信”栏所刊郭曼一同志对我部招考邮电人员的意见，现在我们答复如下：
    我部自成立迄今，虽已建立了全国统一的邮电机构，但全国统一的招考录用人员的制度尚在研究拟订中。郭同志的意见很好，我部在今后拟订该项制度时当加以注意。
