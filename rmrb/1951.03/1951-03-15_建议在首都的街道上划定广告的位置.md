    Suggestion to Designate Advertising Locations on Streets in the Capital
    To the Editor:
    Having come to Beijing from Tianjin, I am deeply thrilled by the achievements of the capital's construction work. However, what is headache-inducing is that many streets' walls, utility poles, and even bridge railings are covered with messy advertisements of all kinds. Many of these advertisements promote the efficacy of "kidney-tonifying pills" and the like. These advertisements not only detract from the magnificence and grandeur of the capital's cityscape, but some even obscure the government decrees and policies that have been posted. Therefore, I suggest that the municipal authorities mobilize the masses to wash away the aforementioned advertisements and designate advertising columns on each street and in public places, so that there is no more indiscriminate posting everywhere. The government's notice boards should also be free of other advertisements.

### 建议在首都的街道上划定广告的位置

专栏：读者来信

    建议在首都的街道上划定广告的位置编辑同志：
    我从天津来到北京，深为首都建设工作的成就感到兴奋。但是，使人头痛的是，很多街道的墙壁上、电杆上甚至连桥栏杆上都贴着杂乱的各色各样的广告。广告有很多是宣传“补肾丸”的功效之类。这些广告不但使壮丽、伟大的首都市容减色，而且有的广告把张贴出来的政府法令、政策都给遮住了。因此，我建议市政当局发动群众将上述广告洗刷掉，在各街道及公共场所划定广告栏，不要再满街乱贴，政府的布告栏内更不应有其他广告。

    编者按：读者律宗宪的建议，望有关部门研究、采纳。
