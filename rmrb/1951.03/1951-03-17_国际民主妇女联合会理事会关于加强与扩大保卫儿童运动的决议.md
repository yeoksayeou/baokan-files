　　Resolution of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation on Strengthening and Expanding the Movement to Defend Children
    (Adopted at the Fourth Session of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Berlin on February 5, 1951)
    Having heard and discussed the report "Strengthening and Expanding the Movement to Defend Children," the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation believes that the heinous acts of the American and British imperialists threatening to launch a new war have aroused deep anxiety in the hearts of all honest people around the world for the lives of millions of children and the future of the next generation.
    The war-makers have already transitioned from preparing for war to taking aggressive actions. In the bloody war launched by the American imperialists in Korea, millions upon millions of children lose their lives or their families and parents every day. American interventionists are carrying out the most brutal crimes against humanity—they are cruelly torturing and massively exterminating women, the elderly, and children.
    The people of Wall Street are remilitarizing Germany, creating a new center of war in Europe, and preparing the same fate for European children as for Korean children. The expansion of armaments and the continuous increase in war budgets are a heavy burden on the people. Children are suffering from malnutrition, and they are deprived of everything most needed for normal growth and development. In Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaya, millions upon millions of children are becoming victims of war. Millions of children in colonies and dependent countries are trapped in starvation. In Franco's Spain and royalist fascist Greece, children are suffering terrible exploitation and devastation. The British and American occupation authorities are obstructing the return of Soviet children now in West Germany to their homeland. The Tito gang, using the same methods as the American imperialists, is handing over the children of Greek patriots to the royalist fascist government. Imperialist reactionaries are working to corrupt youth, instill racial hatred, and turn them into blindly obedient soldiers, serving as cannon fodder for their planned bloody massacres.
    The new war threat facing humanity and the deterioration of children's circumstances impose a responsibility on women all over the world, on mothers everywhere, regardless of their political or religious beliefs, regardless of their social status, to resolutely defend the lives of their children.
    The Council approves of the activities of the Women's International Democratic Federation and its national member organizations in safeguarding children's rights. The success of the first International Children's Day celebration in fifty-one countries clearly demonstrates that this activity is in line with the ardent desires of all honest people. The success of this day also demonstrates that the struggle to improve the fate of children can widely mobilize people from all walks of life, regardless of their social status, political or religious beliefs.
    Therefore, the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation decides:
    (1) To launch a broad movement for the 1951 International Children's Day under the following slogans: Eliminate the threat of war, protect the lives of children, reduce war budgets, increase funds for improving children's conditions, protecting children's health, and education, democratize children's education and teaching, and demand an end to war propaganda in schools, children's publications, films, and radio.
    (2) To convene an International Conference for the Defence of Children in 1951. To extensively involve various organizations and individuals concerned with social, cultural, and scientific issues, as well as those who study children's issues or may be interested in children's issues, to participate in the preparatory work and the conference. The conference will discuss how to improve the lives and education of children in a peaceful world.
    (3) To recommend that national member organizations conscientiously carry out the preparatory work for the conference. To this end, a wide-ranging survey of children's living conditions, health education, and children's education should be conducted, and then demands should be made and concrete and rapid actions taken in every city, every suburb, and every village to improve the fate of children. To convene a national conference for the defense of children, as the Italian Women's Federation has done.
    (4) In order to create a large-scale movement to defend children: 1. Expand the International Committee for the Defence of Children, inviting people from all walks of life, including social, cultural, scientific, artistic, and religious figures, to participate; 2. Organize national and local committees for the defense of children with broad representation; 3. Develop cooperation in every possible way between various highly diverse groups, including women's groups that have not joined the Women's International Democratic Federation.
    (5) To widely publicize the methods of solving children's problems in the Soviet Union and the achievements made in education and protection of children in various people's democracies.
    The Council calls on all men and women who love children—the future of the world—to rise up to defend children and protect them from the threat of war.

### 国际民主妇女联合会理事会关于加强与扩大保卫儿童运动的决议

　　国际民主妇女联合会理事会关于加强与扩大保卫儿童运动的决议
    （一九五一年二月五日在柏林第四届国际民主妇联理事会会议上通过）
    在听取与讨论了《加强与扩大保卫儿童运动》的报告以后，国际民主妇联理事会认为，美英帝国主义者威胁着要发动一个新战争的罪恶行为，在全世界一切正直人民的心中为千百万儿童的生命，为下一代的未来，引起了深切的焦虑。
    战争制造者们已经从准备战争过渡到采取侵略行动。在美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动的血腥战争中，每天有千千万万的儿童丧失了生命或者失掉了他们的家庭与父母。美国干涉者正在进行着与人类为敌的最凶暴的罪行——他们残忍地非刑酷打与大批毁灭妇女、老人与儿童。
    华尔街的人们正在使德国重新军国主义化，在欧洲制造一个新的战争中心，替欧洲的儿童准备着和朝鲜儿童同样的命运。军备的扩充与战争预算的不断增长，对人民是一个沉重的负担。儿童们遭受着营养不良的痛苦，他们被剥夺了正常的成长与发育所最需要的一切。在越南、印尼、缅甸以及马来亚，千千万万的儿童成为战争的牺牲者，殖民地与附属国家的千百万儿童陷于饥饿之中，在佛朗哥西班牙及保皇法西斯的希腊，儿童们正在遭受着可怕的榨取与摧残。英美占领当局正在阻挠现在西德的苏联儿童返回祖国。使用着美帝国主义者同样手段的铁托匪帮，正在把希腊爱国者的孩子们移交给保皇法西斯政府。帝国主义反动派正在努力腐化青年，灌输种族仇恨，使他们变成盲目驯顺的兵士，充当他们准备中的血腥屠杀的炮灰。
    人类面临的新战争威胁和儿童情况的恶化，对全世界的妇女，对各地的母亲们，不论她们的政治或宗教信仰如何，不论她们的社会地位如何，赋与了一种责任，要她们坚决保卫她们的孩子们的生命。
    理事会赞同国际民主妇联及各国会员团体在维护儿童权益方面的活动。在五十一个国家内庆祝第一次国际儿童节的成功，明显地证明了这种活动是符合一切正直人民的殷切的愿望。这一天的成功也说明了，改善儿童命运的斗争能够广泛动员各阶层的人民，不论他们的社会地位，政治或宗教信仰如何。
    因此，国际民主妇联理事会决定：
    （一）一九五一年的国际儿童节在下列的口号下发动一个广泛的运动：消除战争威胁，保护儿童的生命，缩减战争预算，增加改进儿童情况、保护儿童健康及教育的款项，使儿童教育及教学民主化，要求停止学校、儿童出版物、电影与无线电里的战争宣传。
    （二）在一九五一年召开国际保卫儿童会议。大量吸收各种有关社会、文化与科学问题的团体与个人，以及研究儿童问题的或可能对儿童问题发生兴趣的人，来参加筹备工作和大会。会议将讨论如何在一个和平世界里改进儿童的生活与教育。
    （三）建议各国会员团体认真地进行会议的筹备工作。为此，应进行对儿童的生活状况，保健教育与儿童教育的广泛调查，然后在每一个城市，每一个郊区和每一乡村中提出要求并采取具体与迅速行动来改善儿童的命运。召开意大利妇女联合会曾经召开过的全国保卫儿童会议。
    （四）为了造成一个大规模的保卫儿童运动：一、扩大国际保卫儿童委员会，邀请社会、文化、科学、艺术与宗教等各方面的人士参加；二、组织具有广泛代表性的全国及地方保卫儿童委员会；三、以一切方法发展各种极不相同的团体之间的合作，包括未参加国际民主妇联的妇女团体在内。
    （五）在各国广泛宣传在苏联解决儿童问题的方法以及各人民民主国家在教育与保护儿童中所获得的成就。
    理事会号召一切爱护儿童——世界的未来——的男女们，起来保卫儿童，使他们不受战争的威胁。
