Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    We agree with Mr. Shi Ming's suggestion, published in your "Letters to the Editor" column on March 12, entitled "Explain Cultural Relics and Historical Sites in Simple Language." We sincerely accept it.
    Before the liberation of Beijing, there were no explanations for the exhibits in the Temple of Heaven. Explanations were added only after liberation. At that time, we did not find sufficient reference materials, nor did we conduct in-depth research. We only slightly modified the records in the "Brief History of the Temple of Heaven," simply aiming for concise wording and neglecting the public accessibility of the explanations.
    This situation has not been corrected for a year, which shows that we have not truly established a perspective of serving the working people and that we lack in-depth research in our professional work. We are now planning to re-examine the exhibits, rewrite the explanations in vernacular language, interpret them from a revolutionary perspective, and consult with experienced antiquarians, striving to make the content of the explanations accurate and accessible.
                                     Tian Tan Management Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government

### 天坛管理处拟改进陈列物的说明

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    天坛管理处拟改进陈列物的说明编辑同志：
    三月十二日贵报《读者来信》栏登载石明同志对《文物古迹应用通俗话来说明》的建议，是很对的，我们诚恳接受。
    北京解放前，天坛陈列物品一向没有说明，解放后才增加了说明。当时，我们并没有找到充足的参考材料，也没有深刻的研究，仅按照天坛记略上的记载略加修改，单纯的为了文字简便，而忽略了说明的群众性。
    这种情况一年来并没改正，这就表现了我们对面向劳动人民的观点没有真正树立，对业务工作也缺乏深入钻研。我们现在正拟把陈列品从新审查，说明文字改用白话，用革命的观点来解释，并向对古物有经验之人请教，尽量使说明内容正确通俗。
                                     北京市人民政府天坛管理处
