How Cooperatives Can Implement Planned Management
	Zhang Lisen

	Planning based on the needs of members and organizing business operations according to the plan are the main links to put cooperatives on the right track. To lead lower-level cooperatives, higher-level cooperatives must grasp the overall situation, and organize and assist lower-level cooperatives in business and organizational activities in a targeted and predictable manner, also relying on plans and through plans to establish planned leadership.

	At present, establishing planning work and implementing planned management in cooperatives is not only necessary but also has the conditions to be implemented. The most basic condition is that the policy of higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives serving members has been clarified. As long as cooperatives resolutely implement this policy, reverse the capitalist business ideology, and serve members instead of non-members and the market, making members organized and fixed customers, and cooperatives at all levels in various places form an organized supply and marketing network; this makes it possible for cooperatives to not only investigate and statistically analyze the needs of members, comprehensively consider their own strength and the national economic situation, and formulate realistic plans, but also to guarantee the organization and implementation of the plan.

	Practical experience in various places fully proves this point. Since the first quarter of last year, cooperatives in Northeast China have begun to establish a planning system throughout the region. Although they have encountered many difficulties and have many shortcomings and problems in the past year, they have played a role in strengthening the working relationship between higher and lower-level cooperatives and strengthening the organization and planning of business operations. Taking the promotion of accounting and statistical work as an example, more than 80% of grassroots cooperatives in Jilin Province can now submit reports on time, and 90% of grassroots cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have implemented budget systems. Although no systematic planning system has been established in North China and East China, cooperatives that earnestly serve their members feel the necessity of planned management. Cooperatives that truly make plans based on the needs of their members and strive to promote the realization of the plans have significantly reduced blindness and enhanced planning in their business. The four cooperatives in Beijing that implement rationing have a capital turnover of more than ten times per month, which is one example. It can be seen that the question is no longer whether cooperatives need or can implement planned management, but how to overcome difficulties and effectively establish cooperative planning work under the existing conditions.

	I. How to Make Plans Under Existing Conditions

	The basis for cooperatives to prepare plans must strictly proceed from the needs of members. To truly grasp the needs of members, it is necessary to conduct systematic investigation and research. Grassroots cooperatives can adopt methods such as conducting interviews and investigations with members or mobilizing member groups to discuss and propose needs plans, or the cooperative can grasp the purchasing power, sales volume, and consumption volume of several representative typical member households, and after comparative research, extrapolate based on the number of members. United cooperatives above the county level need to grasp the survey materials of typical village cooperatives, district cooperatives, and county cooperatives. When studying the needs of members, attention should be paid to their complexity. Specific consideration should be given to different situations and factors such as region, season, price, and harvest. Plans should be formulated based on the needs of the majority of members. Urban consumer cooperatives should understand the salary income and living expenses of members of different classes. Rural cooperatives should take into account the actual situation when formulating plans, such as the purchase of means of production and the promotion of agricultural and sideline products by members. Moreover, the personal needs and family needs of members are difficult to separate. When formulating plans, they cannot be mechanically calculated only according to the number of members.

	Other main bases for plan preparation should be: (1) The cooperative's own financial capacity and management capacity, and how much it can solve the supply and marketing needs of members; (2) National economic strength, including the types and quantities that state-owned trade and industrial departments need to purchase and promote, and the loans that banks may assist; (3) The production and sales situation of major commodities; (4) Previous operating conditions.

	In terms of the plan preparation procedure, there are currently two methods. One is to start from the grassroots cooperative or county cooperative, and report level by level for comprehensive summarization, and then issue and deploy after being revised and approved by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives or the General Cooperative of the Greater Administrative Region. The other is to first prepare a general plan from top to bottom, issue it level by level, and then supplement and revise it from bottom to top, and implement it after being filed or approved by the higher-level cooperative. The most reasonable method is to first formulate plan instructions and control figures by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives or the General Cooperative of the Greater Administrative Region based on the operating conditions of the previous year, the development direction of the current year, and the national economic requirements, before the plan is prepared, and issue them level by level. The grassroots cooperative or county cooperative then prepares and declares the plan according to the instructions of the higher-level cooperative, and reports it level by level for comprehensive summarization, and then issues and deploys it level by level after being revised and approved by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives or the General Cooperative of the Greater Administrative Region. This makes the plan truly closely combine from bottom to top and from top to bottom under a unified direction and unified leadership.

	II. How to Guide Grassroots Cooperatives to Make Plans

	Under the current situation, it is difficult for grassroots cooperatives to generally make plans, but this does not mean that grassroots cooperatives cannot make plans. The experience of various places over the past year has proved that as long as grassroots cooperatives straighten their business direction, truly serve their members, and prepare simple business plans on time, it is possible. The problem lies in the leadership and assistance of county and city united cooperatives. According to the experience of Jilin, Beijing, and Tianjin, the most important thing in leading grassroots cooperatives to make plans is to grasp the key points, select a few cooperatives that have been better transformed, and conduct systematic and specific assistance, create typical examples, draw experience, and promote comprehensive development. In grasping the key points, it should be combined with promoting other grassroots cooperatives to make plans. Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, holds a county-wide meeting of district, village, and cooperative directors every time it prepares and revises plans, and those who implement planned management and those who have not implemented planned management participate together, using typical cooperatives as examples for publicity and mobilization, and using cooperatives with similar conditions that can make plans to help those who cannot make plans to research and discuss, compare and estimate, and use forms similar to short-term training courses, once, twice, or several times, from being clueless to having a number in mind, from blind estimation to calculation based on evidence, from inaccurate to approaching accuracy, and slowly drive the entire grassroots cooperative to learn how to make plans. At the same time, each district cooperative in Jilin counties has a survey statistician to guide and help the village cooperatives in its district to fill in reports, organize accounting, and make plans, which is also a good method.

	To make grassroots cooperatives pay attention to plans and act according to plans, county (city) cooperatives must closely link their business with grassroots cooperatives through certain systems and methods in business operations. For example, the Jiaohe County Cooperative implements a purchase order system, and grassroots cooperatives must submit a plan every month when purchasing goods from the county cooperative or state-owned stores, which has proven to be a very effective method. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperatives has implemented a quota allocation method for wholesale to grassroots cooperatives since last autumn, which has also played a certain role in making grassroots cooperatives pay attention to making plans.

	III. A Unified Planning System Must Be Established

	The cooperative economy is an organic whole, and it is also an important part of the entire national economy. Therefore, not only the plans of higher-level and lower-level cooperatives and the plans of cooperatives in one region and another should be combined with each other, but also they should be linked with the plans of the national economy, especially the state-owned trade departments. Only in this way can the integrity and comprehensiveness of planned management be fully utilized. Otherwise, if each acts on its own and is not related to each other, without coordination and connection, even if the plans of each unit are correct, the result will still be very blind during implementation. For example, two county cooperatives in Jiaodong District went to North Korea in the same season to promote the rapeseed of their members, and another went to Northeast China to purchase rapeseed for their members. The cooperatives in Lianghuai District, Subei, transported soybean cakes through Huangqiao to Shanghai for promotion, while the cooperatives in the Huangqiao area sent people to Shanghai to purchase soybean cakes. Similar situations have also occurred in other regions. At the same time, due to the lack of a certain planning system, cooperatives in North China and East China mostly use their own sets of content types, plan forms, calculation methods, prices, and units of measurement when making plans, without meeting each other. Not only is it difficult to combine with each other, but it is even impossible to summarize.

	Therefore, establishing a unified planning system so that cooperatives in various places are consistent in plan procedures, content types, preparation methods, deadlines, and plan forms under unified regulations, and achieve close integration, is an urgent problem to be solved in improving and promoting cooperative planning work.

	IV. How to Make Plans Realistic and Effective

	Cooperatives in various places often feel that their plans are unrealistic and even divorced from business, and do not play a role. This is certainly due to a lack of experience, insufficient information during preparation, failure to truly grasp the situation, and a lack of careful consideration and detailed calculations, resulting in vague plans that are far from reality. But more importantly, many cooperatives believe that they are done after the plan is made and put it aside; they are perfunctory in deployment, or simply allocate tasks equally as a task, without considering the specific situation; in implementation, they do not actively organize forces and adopt various effective methods (such as signing contracts, strengthening economic accounting, etc.) to strive for the realization of the plan. At the same time, they neglect to systematically and deeply check the implementation of the plan through regular statistical reports, reports, and on-site inspections, and fail to discover and solve problems in time, and fail to revise the plan in time, so the plan becomes a formality.

	Many cooperative cadres have a simple task-oriented view of formulating plans, and are satisfied with completing the plan in terms of numbers, and do not pay attention to analyzing and researching specific commodity varieties, sources and targets, costs, prices, and profits, and do not conduct inspections from whether the needs of members are fully met. Some people regard the plan as an absolutely static thing, requiring 100% accuracy, or else there is no need for a plan; they do not view it from a developmental perspective, and do not realize that in addition to the original conditions, the plan should also be supplemented and revised at any time according to the new situation to make the plan more realistic and play its positive role.

	At the same time, the experience in Northeast China proves that; to prevent the plan from being divorced from actual business, every department of the cooperative, especially the cadres of the business department, must actively participate in the formulation of the plan and act according to the plan, and regard the establishment of planning work as the common task of all cooperative cadres. The leadership cadres' attention to this work and personal participation in leading the formulation, and promoting and checking its implementation, is an even more decisive key.

　　合作社怎样实现计划经营
      张立森
    根据社员需要作计划，并按照计划组织业务经营，是使合作社走上正轨的主要环节。上级社领导下级社要做到掌握全面，在一定明确目标之下，有根据有预见地去组织和帮助下级社进行业务与组织各方面的活动，也必须依靠计划和通过计划，建立计划性的领导。
    目前合作社建立计划工作实行计划经营不但必需而且具有可能实行的条件。最基本的条件就是上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务的方针已明确，合作社只要坚决贯彻这一方针，扭转资本主义的经营思想，以社员为服务对象而不以非社员和市场为服务对象，使社员成为有组织的固定的主顾，各地各级合作社结成一个有组织的供销网；这样就使合作社不仅有可能调查统计社员需要，综合本身力量与国家经济情况，订出切合实际的计划，并且可以有保证的组织计划的实现。
    各地实际经验充分证明了这点，东北合作社从去年第一季度起，便在全区范围开始建立计划工作制度，一年来虽然遇到不少困难，存在着许多缺点和问题，但在密切上下级社的工作联系和加强业务经营的组织性与计划性上是起了作用的。以推动会计统计工作来说，目前吉林省百分之八十以上基层社都能按期填送表报，黑龙江省基层社百分之九十已经实行了预决算制度。华北、华东各地虽然尚未建立系统的计划制度，但凡是认真为社员服务的合作社都感觉计划经营的必要，凡是确实根据社员的需要做计划并努力促使计划实现的合作社，在业务上就显著地减少了盲目性，增强了计划性。北京市实行配售的四个合作社，资金周转每月均在十次以上，就是一例。由此可见，目前已不是合作社需要不需要或能不能实行计划经营的问题，而是如何在现有条件下，克服困难，有效地建立合作社计划工作的问题。
  一、在现有条件下怎样做计划
    合作社编制计划的根据，必须严格的从社员需要出发。要确实掌握社员需求，就需要进行系统的调查研究。基层社可采取向社员进行访问调查或动员社员小组讨论，提出需要计划。或由合作社掌握有代表性的若干典型社员户的购买力、售出量与消费量，经过比较研究，根据社员人数加以推算。县以上联合社就需要掌握典型村社、区社、县社的调查材料。研究社员需要应注意其复杂性，要具体考虑到地区、季节、物价、收成等不同的情况与因素，以大多数社员需要为主，制订计划。城市消费社要了解不同阶层社员的工薪收入与生活支出，农村社在制订计划时要照顾实际情况如社员生产资料的购买与农副业产品的推销，又社员个人的需要与家庭的需要是难以分开的，在制订计划时不能机械地仅按社员人数计算。
    编制计划的其他主要根据应为：（１）合作社本身的资金能力与经营能力，对社员的供销需要能解决多少；（２）国家经济力量，包括国营贸易与工业部门需要收购与推销的种类、数量以及银行可能协助的贷款；（３）主要商品的产销情况；（４）前期经营情况。
    在计划编制程序上，目前有两种办法。一是由基层社或县社做起，逐级综合上报，经全国总社或大行政区总社修正批准后再下达布置。一是先由上而下编制概况计划，逐级下达后，再由下而上补充修正，经上级备案或批准后施行。最合理的办法是在计划编制之前，先由全国总社或大区总社根据上年度经营情况，本年度发展方针与国家经济要求，拟出计划指示与控制数字，逐级下达，由基层社或县社根据上级社指示编制申报计划逐级综合上报，经全国总社或大区总社修正批准再逐级布置下去。这样就使计划在统一方针统一领导之下真正做到自下而上与自上而下地密切结合。
  二、如何领导基层社做计划
    在目前情况下，基层社普遍作计划是有困难的，但这并不等于基层社不能做计划。一年来各地经验都证明基层社只要端正经营方针，真正为社员服务，按期编制简单的业务计划是可能的。问题在于县市联合社的领导和帮助。根据吉林、北京、天津各地经验，领导基层社作计划最主要的是掌握重点，选择少数经过改造较好的合作社，进行系统的具体帮助，创造典型，吸取经验，推广全面。在掌握重点中，应和推动其他基层社作计划相结合。吉林省蛟河县每次编制和修正计划都召开全县区村社主任会议，实行计划经营的与尚未实行计划经营的一齐参加，利用典型社作实例进行宣传动员，通过条件相似会作计划的合作社，帮助不会做的合作社研究讨论，比较估计，用类似短期训练班的形式，一次两次几次，由心中无数到有数，由盲目的估计到有根据的计算，由不准确到接近准确，慢慢就带动了全体基层社都可以学会作计划。同时吉林各县每一区社都设有调查统计员，指导帮助本区各村社填制表报，整理会计和作计划，也是一个好的办法。
    要使基层社重视计划，按计划办事，县（市）社必需在业务经营上通过一定制度和办法与基层社业务密切联系起来。如蛟河县社实行订货单制度，基层社由县社或国营商店进货都必需每月提出计划，证明是一个很有效的办法。北京市总社对基层社批发从去秋起实行定量分配办法，对各基层社重视作计划也起了一定作用。
  三、必需建立统一的计划工作制度
    合作社经济是一个有机的整体，也是整个国民经济的一个重要的组成部分，因此不仅上级社与下级社，这一地区与另一地区合作社的计划要相互结合，而且应与国家经济特别是国营贸易部门的计划联系起来，这样才能充分发挥计划经营的整体性和全面联系性。否则，各自为政，互不相关，没有配合联系，这样即使各个单位的计划正确，结果在执行时仍是带有很大的盲目性。如胶东区两个县社在同一个季节一个到北朝鲜去推销社员的菜籽，另一个又到东北去为社员购买菜籽。苏北两淮区合作社经过黄桥运豆饼去上海推销，同时黄桥地区的合作社却派人去上海采购豆饼。类似的情形在其他地区也曾发生过。同时，因为缺乏一定计划工作制度，华北华东各地合作社作计划，在内容种类、计划表格、计算方法、价格、计量单位等方面大都各搞一套，互不碰头，不但难于彼此结合，甚至无法汇总。
    因此，建立统一的计划工作制度，使各地合作社在计划程序、内容种类、编制办法、期限以及计划表格各方面，在统一规定之下步调一致，做到密切结合，是目前改善和推进合作社计划工作中一个急待解决的问题。
  四、如何使计划切合实际，发挥作用
    各地合作社计划常常感觉不切实际，甚至与业务脱节，不起作用。这固然由于缺乏经验，在编制时根据不足，未能确实掌握情况，缺乏缜密考虑与精细计算，以致计划笼统，与实际有很大距离。但更重要的还在于许多合作社在计划做出之后，便认为完事，丢在一边；在布置时潦草塞责，或当作单纯任务平均分配，不很好考虑具体情况；在执行时不积极组织力量，采取各种有效办法（如订立合同，加强经济核算等等），争取计划的实现。同时忽视通过定期统计报告，汇报和实地检查等方式有系统地深入地检查计划执行情况，及时发现和解决问题，及时修正计划，因而使计划流于形式。
    不少合作社干部对于制订计划存在着单纯任务观点，满足于数目字上的完成计划，不注意在具体商品品种、来源与对象、成本、价格、利润等方面去分析研究，不从是否充分满足社员需要上去进行检查。有些人把计划看作绝对的静止的东西，要就百分之百的准确，要不就无需有计划；不从发展的观点来看，没有认识到制订计划除原有条件以外，还应根据新的情况，随时补充修正，使计划更切合实际，发挥其积极的作用。
    同时，东北经验证明；要使计划不与实际业务脱节，必须使合作社每一部门，特别是业务部门干部积极参加计划的制订，并按计划办事，把建立计划工作当作全体合作社干部的共同任务。领导干部对这项工作的重视和亲自参加领导制订，并推动和检查促其实现，更是有决定意义的关键。
