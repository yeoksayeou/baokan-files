Xinhua News Agency, 21st: County-level People's Representative Conferences have been widely held across the country, further consolidating the people's democratic regime. According to statistics截止于by the end of last December, out of 2,068 counties nationwide, 1,961 counties had convened People's Representative Conferences, accounting for over 94.8% of the total; out of 58 banners nationwide, 46 banners had convened People's Representative Conferences, accounting for 79.3% of the total. Ninety counties and five banners nationwide have had their People's Representative Conferences exercise the functions and powers of People's Congresses, and 23 counties have held People's Congresses.

The People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses at the county level have discussed and resolved the urgent issues demanded by the masses of people of all strata in their localities, and have been warmly embraced by the people. Lin Zhennan, a farmer representative from Minqing County, Fujian Province, said at the county's third People's Representative Conference: "I participated in the first conference, which resolved the issue of eliminating bandits, ensuring the interests of the people; I participated in the second conference, which resolved the issue of overcoming famine. The Communist Party and the People's Government are a bright light, and we must resolutely follow them!" Through the conferences, the people's political awareness has been gradually raised, and the broad masses of people are managing their own affairs and the affairs of the country with a sense of ownership. Li Baorong, a stall vendor representative from Taizhou, Northern Jiangsu, said: "I have participated in five conferences. The first time I just listened, the second time I only said good things, the third time I began to dare to offer criticism, the fourth time I spoke boldly, and this time I can speak freely and without reservation." After hearing the government's report on financial revenue and expenditure at the conference, representatives from Fu'an County, Fujian Province, excitedly said: "The government not only handles affairs for us, but also reports the accounts to us, we are truly masters of our own affairs." Through the conferences, government cadres have also become more aware of the boundless wisdom and great power of the people, and the shortcomings of a few cadres who are not good at mobilizing and uniting people from all walks of life to work together have gradually been corrected.

Facts have proven that promoting people's democratic construction with the county as the focus is entirely correct. Due to the widespread holding of county-level People's Representative Conferences, the policies and decrees of the higher-level People's Governments can be promptly transmitted to the vast rural areas, and the opinions of the people can also be quickly gathered. County-level People's Representative Conferences are a model for district and township-level People's Representative Conferences. Wherever the county-level People's Representative Conferences are held well, the district and township-level People's Representative Conferences are also easily held well.

Opening County People's Representative Conference Should Pay Attention to Several Matters

In the past year, according to the experience of People's Representative Conferences in various counties, the following points should be noted in order to hold the conferences well:

(1) Full preparation before the meeting and full promotion of democracy at the meeting are the keys to holding the meeting well. Preparatory work is generally carried out through the Standing Committee of the County People's Representative Conference and symposiums of various circles, and the issues to be resolved at the meeting and the solutions are fully deliberated and consulted before the meeting. Regarding the shortcomings in the government's work, the person in charge of the County People's Government should conduct self-criticism at the meeting and humbly listen to the opinions of the people, so that the representatives can express their opinions and criticisms to the government without reservation. The facts in many places have proven that the better the criticism and self-criticism are made, the better the meetings will be held.

(2) The agenda of the county-level People's Representative Conference generally focuses on resolving farmers' problems. Many places consciously separate the issues related to the vital interests of farmers according to the situation at the time, such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, agricultural production, rent reduction, anti-local bullies, land reform, mutual aid and cooperation, water conservancy, urban-rural trade, or grain requisition, etc., as the main topics of the meeting, which are most popular among the people, and the meeting is most effective. Some places organize representatives to report on their work and production experience at the meeting, and make typical reports. Some commend labor models and work models at the meeting, or use the gaps in the meeting to hold exhibitions on production or other work. In this way, the meeting is more lively and held better.

While discussing and solving the problems of farmers, we must also earnestly solve the problems of people from other walks of life. In order to overcome the difficulties of short meeting time and many contents, various places have adopted the following methods: 1. Solve the central problems in the main time of the meeting, and use the gaps in the meeting to hold various special symposiums to discuss and solve other problems; 2. Immediately after the meeting, hold separate meetings of people from other walks of life to solve the problems of people from other walks of life; 3. Divide into groups according to circles to discuss the problems of people from all walks of life; 4. Discuss the problems of people from other walks of life in connection with the problems of farmers, such as discussing winter sideline production to connect with how industry and commerce and farmers can connect, close the relationship between urban and rural areas, and solve supply and marketing problems.

(3) The allocation and generation of representatives should pay attention to ensuring that all regions have representatives, and representatives should generally be generated on the basis of townships or administrative villages. In counties with many townships and administrative villages, representatives are generated according to the number of constituencies by dividing the natural geographical divisions of each township or administrative village into several constituencies. The method of generating representatives has gradually increased the use of elections, and the consultation and invitation have gradually decreased. In some counties in Northeast China, all representatives are elected.

(4) In terms of the form of the meeting, various places have created many good experiences that are practical. Farmers welcome short reports, preferably reporting one problem and discussing one problem. Many farmers are not used to speaking at large meetings and have many concerns, so more small meetings should be held and fewer large meetings. Farmers are accustomed to speaking their own way, with little debate, and some speak ramblingly, so it is necessary to be good at guiding and inspiring them to deepen the discussion. Many farmers and working women are illiterate, so proposals should not be formalistic. In many places, cadres help representatives write proposals, or collect representatives' opinions before the meeting, organize them, and submit them to the meeting for discussion as proposals. According to the experience of various places, it is enough to hold the meeting four times a year, and three times is also possible; at least two times should be held. It is more appropriate to convene during agricultural seasons such as preparing for spring plowing, mobilizing for summer weeding, welcoming autumn harvest, arranging for autumn requisition, and preparing for winter sideline production.

(5) Representatives not only deliberate on matters, but also assist the government in mobilizing the broad masses of people to implement. In many places, representatives actively conveyed the resolutions after the meeting and took the lead, mobilizing the people they represented to do the same, which had a great effect.

There are still some shortcomings in the current county-level People's Representative Conferences. The People's Representative Conferences in some counties have not been held on time and have not formed a system. Some cadres still believe that the meeting has nothing to do with the work, "the meeting has increased the workload." Secondly, there are not many county-level People's Representative Conferences that exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Some counties have a good working foundation and mass organizations, and the meetings are also held well, and they should exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress, but they have not yet done so. Third, some places use the form of cadre meetings to hold representative meetings, and are not good at absorbing correct opinions from all parties. Some mechanically use the set of forms of the People's Representative Conferences of provinces and cities, or the discussion in the meeting and the transmission and implementation of resolutions after the meeting are not serious enough, forming a disconnection between the meeting and the work, and a disconnection between the representatives and the work. Fourth, the standing committees of the People's Representative Conferences in many counties have not yet established regular work and have not played their due role.

In order to better hold the county-level People's Representative Conferences, the People's Governments of all provinces (regions) are strengthening cadre education, formulating specific plans, conducting key experiments, and providing specific guidance and assistance, and will summarize the experience and establish a regular inspection and reporting system.

　　全国百分之九十四以上县份
    开过各界人民代表会议
    解决了各阶层人民迫切要求解决的问题
    使政府的政策法令及时传达到广大农村
    【新华社二十一日讯】县各界人民代表会议已在全国范围内普遍举行，进一步巩固了人民民主政权。据截止于去年十二月底的统计，全国二千零六十八个县中已有一千九百六十一个县开过各界人民代表会议，占总数百分之九十四点八强；全国五十八个旗中已有四十六个旗开过各界人民代表会议，占总数百分之七十九点三。全国已有九十个县、五个旗的各界人民代表会议代行了人民代表大会的职权，二十三个县已举行人民代表大会。
    各县各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会讨论和解决了当地各阶层人民群众迫切要求解决的问题，受到人民的热烈拥护。福建省闽清县农民代表林振南在该县第三届各界人民代表会议上说：“我参加过第一届会议，第一届会议解决了清剿土匪问题，使人民利益得到保障；我参加过第二届会议，第二届会议解决了度荒问题。共产党和人民政府是一盏明灯，我们一定要坚决地跟着它走！”通过会议，逐渐提高了人民的政治觉悟，广大人民群众正以主人翁的态度管理着自己的及国家的事。苏北泰州摊贩代表李宝荣说：“我参加了五次会议。第一次是听会，第二次只说好话，第三次开始敢提批评，第四次大胆说话，这一次就畅所欲言了。”福建省福安县代表在会上听了政府财政收支的报告后兴奋地说：“政府不仅给我们办事，还给我们报账，我们真是当家作主了。”通过会议，也使政府的工作干部更加认识到人民群众的无限智慧和伟大力量，少数干部不善于动员和团结各界人民共同工作的缺点逐渐得到纠正。
    事实证明：人民民主建政工作的推行，以县为重点是完全正确的。由于县各界人民代表会议的普遍举行，上级人民政府的政策法令能及时传达到广大农村中去，人民群众的意见也因此迅速地集中起来。县各界人民代表会议是区、乡各界人民代表会议的榜样。凡县各界人民代表会议开得好的地方，区、乡的人民代表会议也就容易开好。
     开好县人民代表会议应该注意的几件事项
    一年来，根据各地县各界人民代表会议的经验，要开好会议，应该注意下面几点：
    （一）会前充分准备和会上充分发扬民主，是开好会议的关键。准备工作一般是通过县各界人民代表会议常务委员会和各界座谈会进行的，会议要解决的问题和解决办法都先在会前经过充分酝酿和协商。对于政府工作中的缺点，县人民政府负责人应在会上进行自我批评，并虚心听取人民群众的意见，这样，代表们才能知无不言，言无不尽地对政府提出意见和批评。很多地方的事实证明：批评和自我批评作得好，会议就都开得很好。
    （二）县各界人民代表会议的议题，一般以解决农民问题为主。许多地方按照当时情况有意识地分别把关系农民切身利益的问题，如抗美援朝、农业生产、减租、反恶霸、土地改革、互助合作、水利、城乡贸易或征收公粮等作为会议的主要议题，最受人民欢迎，会议收效也最大。有的地方组织代表在会上报告工作和生产经验，作典型报告。有的在会上表扬劳动模范和工作模范，或利用会议空隙举办生产或其它工作的展览会。这样，会议就更生动，开得更好。
    在讨论和解决农民问题的同时，也要认真地解决其它各界人民的问题。为了克服会议时间短、内容多的困难，各地分别采用以下几种办法：一、在会议主要时间解决中心问题，利用会议空隙分别举行各种专题座谈会，讨论和解决其他问题；二、会后随即单独召开其它各界人民的会议，解决其它各界人民的问题；三、按界划分小组，分别讨论各界人民的问题；四、把其它各界人民的问题与农民问题联系讨论，如讨论冬季副业生产便联系到工商界和农民如何联系，密切城乡关系，解决供销问题。
    （三）代表的分配和产生，要注意使各地区都能有代表，一般要以乡或行政村为单位产生代表。在乡和行政村较多的县，就按各乡或行政村的自然地理区划分为若干选区，按选区数目产生代表。代表产生的方法，用选举方式的已经逐渐增多，协商邀请的已逐渐减少。东北已有些县的全部代表都是由选举产生的。
    （四）在会议的方式上，各地已创造出许多切合实际的好经验。农民欢迎简短的报告，最好报告一个问题，讨论一个问题。许多农民不习惯在大会上讲话，且顾虑较多，要多开小会，少开大会。农民发言，习惯于各说一套，争论不多，有的说话拉杂，因此，要善于引导启发才能使讨论深入。农民和劳动妇女不识字的较多，因此提案不能拘形式，很多地方是干部帮助代表写提案，或在会前搜集代表意见，整理后作为提案提交会议讨论。会议的次数和时间，据各地经验，每年开四次就够了，三次也可；最少应开两次。在准备春耕、动员夏锄、迎接秋收、布置秋征，及准备冬季副业生产等农事季节召开，较为适宜。
    （五）代表不仅是议事，并且要协助政府动员广大人民执行。许多地方的代表在会后积极传达决议，并起带头作用，动员其所代表的人民一道去做，作用很大。
    县各界人民代表会议目前还存在有一些缺点。部分县的各界人民代表会议还没有按时举行，形成制度。有些干部还认为会议与工作无关，“开会增加了工作负担”。其次，县各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的还不多。有些县的工作基础和群众组织较好，会议也开得较好，本应代行人民代表大会职权，但仍未代行。第三，有的地方采用干部会的方式开代表会，不善于吸收各方面的正确意见。有的机械地搬用省、市各界人民代表会议的一套形式，或是会中讨论和会后传达及执行决议都不够认真，形成会议与工作脱节，代表与工作脱节。第四，有不少县的各界人民代表会议常务委员会还没有建立经常工作，未起应有的作用。
    为了更好地开好县各界人民代表会议，各省（区）人民政府正加强干部教育，订立具体计划，进行重点试验，作具体的指导和帮助，并将总结经验，建立经常的检查报告制度。
