    Large-Scale Spring Water Conservancy Project About to Begin
    Ten Thousand Civilian Laborers in the Tianjin Special District Stand Ready on the Dikes
    Combining Agricultural and Sideline Production Mutual Aid Groups with Spring Repairs Ensures No Disruption to Both Spring Repairs and Spring Plowing

    The Tianjin Special District has organized ten thousand civilian laborers to stand ready on the dikes. The task of this year's spring water conservancy project in the special district is immense, with earthwork engineering reaching over 10.62 million cubic meters, requiring over 100,000 civilian laborers working for sixty days to complete. To successfully complete this year's spring work task, spring work committees have been established from the special district to the counties. According to statistics from Ninghe, Tianjin, and four other counties alone, 372 county and district cadres are participating in spring work leadership. From the beginning of February to the beginning of March, according to statistics from Tianjin, Jinghai, Wen'an, Dacheng, Baodi, Wuqing, and Ninghe seven counties, 1,052,43 people have been mobilized and organized.

    During the mobilization and organization of civilian laborers, the leadership organs at all levels in the Tianjin Special District paid special attention to the combination of spring work and spring plowing production. The specific methods are as follows:

    First, the original agricultural and sideline production mutual aid groups are elevated to mutual aid groups that combine agriculture, sideline production, and river work. This is the best way to combine work attendance with production. For example, the Hu Wenbin mutual aid group in the fourth village of Xinzhen, Wen'an County, originally consisted of six households engaged in saltpeter production. To complete the spring work task, the group, after discussion, absorbed two more households. The whole group has eight laborers and two head of livestock, cultivating 95 mu of land. The group should send two civilian laborers. After everyone's research, it was decided that the land of all eight households would be cultivated by the men and women at home, and appropriate methods for calculating and evaluating work were established to ensure the quality of cultivation. In terms of sideline production, it was stipulated that the profits from saltpeter production would be divided equally among the eight households. In addition, to reward the active labor of civilian laborers working away from home, it was stipulated that all wage rice earned by civilian laborers for actively exceeding the quota would belong to the individual. The group also established a covenant stipulating that those remaining in the village for production should: (1) ensure that the land is planted on time; (2) ensure that sideline production does not stop; (3) ensure that water consumption is not difficult for the families of civilian laborers. At the same time, it was stipulated that those working as civilian laborers away from home should: (1) not return home until the work is completed; (2) not return home without permission; (3) actively work to improve efficiency, ensure project quality, and strive for early completion.

    Second, the entire village's labor force is divided into several groups (those who have already formed mutual aid groups are no longer divided), and then the total number of civilian laborers to be sent by the entire village is allocated to each group. Each group then reports and discusses among themselves to determine who goes to work and who stays home for production. This is also a better way to mobilize civilian laborers, and it can also take care of the difficulties of the civilian laborers. For example, in the Zhai Qingshan group in Ao Zui Village, District Ten of Wuqing, Yang Dezhong, Jia Changle, and two others volunteered to work. Yang and Jia, in particular, had difficult lives and lacked seeds for planting. Everyone was willing to lend them in advance. Group leader Zhai Qingshan also said: "I am responsible if your 68 mu of land is left uncultivated. You just focus on digging the river."

    The above are the two main methods that have been relatively successful in mobilizing civilian laborers in the Tianjin Special District. However, in individual villages, phenomena such as simple apportionment, hiring, and assigning work based on land area or drawing lots in violation of policy have occurred. The counties are correcting or have already corrected them. As the construction date is approaching, the counties are conducting a comprehensive inspection of the civilian labor teams and are actively carrying out construction preparations such as dividing sections on the construction site, building sheds, and transporting grain.

　　大规模水利春修工程即将开始
    天津专区十万民工待命上堤
    农副业生产互助组与春修结合可保春修、春耕两不误
    天津专区已组织好十万民工待命上堤。该专区今年水利春修工程任务浩大，土工工程即达一○六二万余公方，计需民工十万余人，作工六十天才能完成。为胜利完成今年春工任务，该专区从专区到县均建立了春工委员会，仅据宁河、天津等六个县统计，县区干部参加春工领导工作的即达三百七十二人。从二月初开始到三月初止，据天津、静海、文安、大城、宝坻、武清、宁河七个县统计，已动员组织民工一○五二四三人。
    在这次民工的动员和组织过程中，天津专区各级领导机关都特别注意了春工和春耕生产的结合问题，其具体办法如下：
    第一是将原来的农业副业生产互助小组，提高为农业副业与河工相结合的互助小组，这是出工与生产相结合的最好办法。例如文安县新镇第四村胡文彬互助组，原有六户合伙进行熬硝生产，这次为了完成春工任务，经全组讨论，又吸收两户参加互助组。全组共有八个劳动力和牲口两头，种地九十五亩。该组应出民工两名，经大家研究后，决定八户土地均由在家的男女耕种，并适当地订出了计工评工办法，在耕作方法上，确定六个男劳力和妇女劳力适当调剂，以保证耕作质量。在副业生产上，规定了熬硝利润按八户均分。另外为奖励外出民工积极劳动，并规定民工因积极劳动超过定额所得工资米全归个人。小组内并订立公约，规定留村生产的：（一）保证把地按期种好；（二）保证副业不停；（三）保证民工家中吃水不困难。同时规定出外当民工的：（一）不完工不回家；（二）不经许可不回家；（三）积极工作提高效率，保证工程质量，而又争取提前完工。
    第二是将全村劳动力划分为若干小组（已组成互助组的不再划组），然后将全村应出民工数目分配到各组，由各组自报公议，讨论确定谁出工，谁在家生产。这也是一种动员民工比较好的办法，同时这种办法也能照顾民工的困难。如武清十区敖咀村翟清山组，在开会讨论时，有杨德中、贾长乐等四人，自愿出工，其中杨、贾二人，生活困难，种地缺种籽，大家都愿意预借给他们。组长翟清山还说：“你们的六十八亩地，荒了我负责，你们只管放心挖河吧。”
    以上是天津专区这次动员民工比较成功的两种主要办法，但有个别村庄发生了单纯摊派、雇佣及按地出工、抓球等违犯政策现象，各县正在纠正或已纠正。现在施工日期已近，各县正进行民工队伍的全面检查工作，并积极进行工地上的分段、搭铺以及粮食的调运等施工准备工作。
