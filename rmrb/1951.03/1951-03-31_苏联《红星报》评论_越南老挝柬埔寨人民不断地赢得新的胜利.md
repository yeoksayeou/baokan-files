　　Soviet "Red Star" Commentary
    The People of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia Continuously Win New Victories
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th] TASS reports: "Red Star" published an article by Leontiev entitled "On the Situation in Indochina." The author wrote: The French colonial army is attempting to restore their rule in Indochina at any cost, but all their efforts have failed. 300,000 French colonial troops and puppet troops are attacking the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. In more than five years of war, the French army has suffered approximately 200,000 casualties, including killed, wounded, and captured personnel. The war in Indochina has cost France $2 billion. The people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are continuously winning new victories in their war against the invaders.
    The Cambodian Liberation Army and guerrillas have cleared the French army from one-third of their territory. People's government institutions have been established in the liberated areas. A large part of Laos has also been liberated.
    The Vietnamese people have achieved the greatest success in the struggle of the Indochinese people for freedom. The Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas have liberated nine-tenths of the territory, with a population of over 18 million in the liberated areas. The French-occupied area has a population of less than 2 million.
    The author went on to condemn the US imperialists' intervention in the Vietnam War. The author stated: The American aggressors have guaranteed to supply the French army with all the necessary weapons and ammunition. According to foreign newspapers, the French army is using a large number of American weapons in its battles against Vietnamese patriots. The Americans have also equipped twelve battalions of the Indochinese colonial army. An American military delegation led by Brink has been in Indochina since last October.
    The author pointed out that the success of the national liberation movement in Indochina is a serious blow to the American aggressors who are trying to expand their intervention in Asia. The peace-loving people of Indochina are determined to thwart the imperialists' plans of aggression and win final victory.

　　苏联《红星报》评论
    越南老挝柬埔寨人民不断地赢得新的胜利
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《红星报》发表里昂捷夫《论印度支那的局势》一文。作者写道：法国殖民军不惜以任何代价，企图恢复他们在印度支那的统治，但是他们所作的一切努力都失败了。法国殖民军和伪军三十万人正在进攻越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民。在五年多的战争当中，法军死伤和被俘的官兵约有二十万人。印度支那的战争，已经消耗了法国二十亿美元。越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民却在反对侵略者的战争中，不断地赢得新的胜利。
    柬埔寨的解放军和游击队已在他们三分之一的国土上肃清了法军。人民政府的机构已经在解放区建立起来。老挝的很大一部分国土也已经获得解放。
    越南人民在印度支那人民争取自由的斗争中获得了最大的成功。越南人民军和游击队已经解放了十分之九的国土，已解放的地区人口超过了一千八百万。法军占领区人口不到二百万。
    作者继谴责美帝国主义者干涉越南战争。作者称：美国侵略者已保证供给法军所需要的一切武器和弹药。据外国报纸称：法军在对越南爱国者的战斗中，使用着大量的美国武器。美国人又装备了印度支那殖民军十二个营。以白林克为首的美国军事代表团自去年十月就已到了印度支那。
    作者指出：印度支那民族解放运动的成功，对于力图在亚洲扩大干涉的美国侵略者是一个严重的打击。印度支那爱好和平的人民，决心挫败帝国主义者的侵略计划，并赢得最后胜利。
