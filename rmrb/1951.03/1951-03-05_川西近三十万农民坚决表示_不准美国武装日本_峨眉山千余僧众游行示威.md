Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 3rd: The patriotic movement in Western Sichuan against American imperialism's arming of Japan has spread to the vast countryside.

　　Farmers in Sancha Township, Dayi County, and rural handicraft workers in Guanxian County successively held demonstrations. More than 10,000 farmers in Sancha Township, Dayi County, marched, holding high farm implements such as sickles and hoes, leading livestock that had been seized back from landlords, and shouting slogans such as "No American Imperialist Arming of Japan" and "We Pledge to Defend the Good Life We Gained Through Struggle."

　　More than 20,000 militia members from Xinjin, Chengdu, and Wenjiang counties and the families of anti-Japanese martyrs from Shuangliu, Huayang, Xinjin, and other counties gathered to denounce the crimes of the Japanese invaders, and issued protest letters against American arming of Japan or wrote letters to their Japanese farmer brothers. Xu Chen, a relative of a martyr from Ximianqiao, Huayang County, said: "I have endured more than ten years of lonely life, suffering the pain of not having a son. I hope that all mothers in the world will unite and resolutely oppose the American devils arming Japan to kill our sons again." More than 1,100 militia members from Tianhui and Sanhe townships in Chengdu wrote in a letter to Japanese farmers: The American robbers want to push you into the fire pit. They are our common enemy, and we should unite and fight them to the end!

　　Representing more than 94,000 farmers in Xinfan County, more than 200 members of the county's agricultural production committees, and more than 5,000 farmers in the first district of Xindu County, respectively passed patriotic covenants at the meeting against American arming of Japan, including guaranteeing that the fruits of rent reduction would be invested in production, striving to increase grain production by 10% this year, not listening to rumors spread by bandits and secret agents, eliminating reactionary societies such as the Yiguandao, and supporting the Chinese and Korean People's forces.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Luzhou, March 2nd: More than 1,000 monks from Emei Mountain, one of the famous Buddhist mountains in southern Sichuan, held a demonstration in Emei County on February 22nd to resist America and aid Korea and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of Japan. Many of them came from temples and nunneries on high mountains above the "snow line". At the rally, Abbot Yan Guan, the host of Longmen Cave in Emei Mountain, delivered a speech. He emphasized that the main work of Buddhists in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is to "strengthen learning, raise awareness, engage in labor production, and rely on our own efforts." Tian Zhongyuan, the county magistrate of Emei County, was also invited to speak, and he expressed his deep appreciation for the patriotic actions of the Buddhist community. The conference passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, a telegram of respect to the Chinese and Korean People's fighters on the Korean front, and a declaration to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan. The declaration called on the Buddhist community throughout the country, especially the monks from other famous Buddhist mountains - Wutai Mountain in Shanxi, Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang, and Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui - to take united action in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
