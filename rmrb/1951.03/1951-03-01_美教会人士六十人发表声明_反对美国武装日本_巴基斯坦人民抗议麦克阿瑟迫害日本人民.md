　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th: According to a United Press report, the January 27th issue of "Christian News" stated that approximately sixty prominent figures in American churches, including Yale University Divinity School professor H. Richard Niebuhr and New York Protestant Council director Dr. Dan M. Potter, jointly issued a statement last December opposing the rearmament of Japan. The statement said: The rearmament of Japan is a terrible adventure in rebuilding Japanese militarism. The rearmament of Japan reminds the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries of the repetition of past Japanese aggression. The statement advocates respecting the provisions of the Japanese Constitution regarding the renunciation of war, positively recognizing the independence of the Japanese nation, and swiftly concluding a peace treaty. The statement also opposes the continued occupation of Japan by American troops after the peace treaty is concluded.

　　Furthermore: The "British Institute of Public Opinion" conducted a survey on the issue of rearming Japan. The results of the survey showed that 65 percent of those surveyed opposed rearming Japan, 19 percent did not respond, and only 15 percent were in favor.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th: According to a TASS report citing the Pakistan General Confederation of Labor, workers and residents of Mianwali City in West Punjab Province, Pakistan, recently held a meeting. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to protest MacArthur's rule in Japan. Participants in the meeting strongly protested MacArthur's suppression of Japanese trade unions and democratic movements. They specifically demanded the revocation of the death sentences imposed on five Japanese trade union leaders who were falsely accused of causing the so-called "Matsukawa Incident."

　　The meeting also passed a resolution demanding that the Pakistani government protest to the United Nations against the French government's illegal measures prohibiting the World Federation of Trade Unions and two other world democratic organizations from operating within French territory.
