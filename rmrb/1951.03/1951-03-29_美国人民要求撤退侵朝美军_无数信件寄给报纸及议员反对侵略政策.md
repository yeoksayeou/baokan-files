Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th:  The commentator of "News", V. Orlov, pointed out: A wave of protest against the unjust war waged by American imperialists in Korea is expanding in the United States. One fact that American newspapers and radio stations cannot conceal is that ordinary Americans are expressing increasingly fierce indignation at the war and aggression policies pursued by the current US government. Opinion polls conducted among the American people illustrate this point. According to materials published by the Gallup poll at the end of January, three out of every four Americans surveyed expressed their support for withdrawing American troops from Korea. Americans are not limited to answering questions from reporters and commentators. Many of them also send angry letters to newspapers protesting the Korean War.

For a long time, the American people have not experienced the full extent of the tragedy of war, which the people of Europe and Asia deeply understand. Now, when they learn about the losses suffered by the American aggressor troops in Korea, many Americans begin to ponder the real purpose of those who send their sons to a foreign country thousands of miles away to die in battle. Ordinary Americans are beginning to feel the war, not from the calm news in the daily newspapers, but from the notifications reporting the deaths of their sons, brothers, and husbands in the distant country of Korea. The Associated Press has confirmed that 99 percent of the letters received by American newspapers demand an end to the Korean War.

Every day, countless letters from all over the United States are sent to Truman and members of Congress, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Korea; this is one way to protest the intervention in Korea. Many citizens send collective protest telegrams to Truman. Of the forty letters received by Truman's supporters, Senators Lehman and Smith, 39 demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. In the letters received by other senators, this proportion is 100 percent.

Many American mass organizations—peace committees, trade union organizations—have come out against American aggression in Korea. American pastors have also risen to participate in the protest movement. The recent American peace petition was one of the best organized ways to protest the unjust Korean War and unite citizens from most states in the United States to hold demonstrations. On March 15, 2,500 representatives of the American people arrived in Washington, D.C., and went to the White House, Congress, and major US government departments to demand that the American rulers change their current reactionary policies. Low-level officials were sent to meet with the representatives and accept their petitions. This once again proves that American rulers are afraid to have open and honest conversations with the specially appointed representatives of their people.

Facts prove that the unjust war of aggression waged by American imperialists in Korea is unpopular among the American people. The greater the losses suffered by American troops in Korea, the more intense the protests of ordinary Americans against these meaningless losses will be.

### 美国人民要求撤退侵朝美军  无数信件寄给报纸及议员反对侵略政策

　　美国人民要求撤退侵朝美军
    无数信件寄给报纸及议员反对侵略政策
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：消息报评论员维·奥尔洛夫指出：反对美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行的非正义战争的抗议浪潮，正在美国扩展中。美国报纸与电台无法掩饰的一个事实就是：美国普通人民对美国现政府奉行的战争与侵略政策，正日益猛烈地表示愤慨。在美国人民中进行的民意测验说明了这一点。根据盖洛普民意测验所一月底发表的材料，每四个被征求意见的美国人中，就有三个人表示主张自朝鲜撤退美国军队。美国人并不限于答复记者和评论家的询问。他们中间有许多人也向报纸投寄愤怒的信件，抗议朝鲜战争。
    很长时期以来，美国人民就没有体验过欧亚两洲人民深深懂得的战争的全部惨状。现在，当他们了解到美国侵略军在朝鲜遭到的损失时，许多美国人就开始思索那些把他们的儿子送到数千英里外的异国去战死的人们的真正目的。普通美国人开始感觉到战争，他们不是从每天报上的平静的消息中感觉到战争，而是从报告儿子、兄弟、丈夫在遥远的国度朝鲜死亡的通知中感觉到战争。美联社已经证实，美国报纸所收到的信件中，有百分之九十九都要求停止朝鲜战争。
    从美国各地每天都有无数信件寄给杜鲁门和国会议员，要求自朝鲜撤退美军，这是抗议干涉朝鲜的方式之一。许多公民拍发集体的抗议电报给杜鲁门。杜鲁门的支持者参议员雷曼和史密斯等所收到的四十封信件中，有三十九封要求自朝鲜撤退美军。在其他参议员所收到的信件中，这种比例是百分之百。
    美国许多群众团体——和平委员会、工会组织——都出来反对美国侵略朝鲜。美国牧师也起来参加抗议运动。不久以前美国的和平请愿，是抗议非正义的朝鲜战争、并把美国大多数州的公民团结起来举行示威的最好的有组织的方式之一。三月十五日，美国人民的代表两千五百人到达华盛顿，前往白宫、国会和美国主要政府部门，要求美国统治者改变现行的反动政策。小官员被派出来接见代表和接受他们的请愿书。这再一次证明美国统治者害怕与他们的人民的特派代表进行开诚布公的谈话。
    事实证明美国帝国主义者在朝鲜进行的非正义的侵略战争，在美国人民中是不得人心的。美国军队在朝鲜遭到的损失愈大，普通美国人对这些无意义的损失的抗议就会愈加猛烈。
