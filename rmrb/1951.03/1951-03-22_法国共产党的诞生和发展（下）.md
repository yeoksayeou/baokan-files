The French Communist Party, which has grown through years of struggle in the spirit of loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, has suffered persecution. The authorities declared it illegal in order to eliminate it, but the storm was unable to subdue it. On June 6, 1940, it pointed out the way to save Paris; on July 10, 1940, on the very day when the parliament, already defeated by depriving the Communists of their representation, proclaimed the demise of the Republic, it called for resistance.

During the Hitler occupation, the Communist Party, led by Thorez, led the struggle. Seventy-five thousand Communist Party members fell in the struggle for France and for Communism.

After the liberation of France, the Communist Party, under the leadership of the General Secretary, stood at the forefront of the warriors striving for national revival. However, the American imperialists intended to extend their clutches into our country by using the "Marshall Plan" and then the "North Atlantic Treaty."

In order to carry out this treacherous scheme, the Communists had to be removed from the government. Ramadier carried out this task. Since then, the policies of the French government have become increasingly blindly obedient to the war-mongering orders of the American imperialists.

Without the Soviet Union, it would have been impossible to defeat Hitler; but they are trying to launch a war against the Soviet Union. In order to carry out this war, the Washington government wants to rearm the West German Nazis.

Thorez exposed the criminal plans of those who were waging war in Korea and Vietnam, provoking the People's Republic of China, and threatening to plunge the whole world into the abyss of suffering, and expressed the feelings of our people with these words: "The French people do not want and will never fight against the Soviet Union!"

Now, when the ruling class is trying to drag us into a new war, trying to rearm Germany and betray the interests of France once again, they are again opposed by the French Communist Party, the party of France that defends peace.

When these rulers try to force the working masses in urban and rural areas to bear the costs required to implement the arms expansion policy, the French Communist Party, the party of the French working class and the French people, rises up against them once again.

Precisely because of this, the enemies of the people are plotting to carry out persecution. The American masters ordered them to eliminate the Communists. Hitler gave them the same order in 1939. However, more and more French people understand that if the Communists are allowed to be eliminated, then everyone else who is willing to remain loyal to the ideals of freedom will be eliminated next, even if they do not completely agree with the Communists. It is for this reason that the French Communist Party is becoming more and more of a bastion of freedom.

We are here to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of our long-standing party in our country. Our party is the party that embodies the traditions and lofty ideals of France, the party of the worker-peasant alliance, the party that strives to turn the brilliant words in our "Internationale" about "the creators of the world—the working workers and peasants" into a vivid reality.

We Communists demand that the tillers have their land, and point out to the peasant masses the road to socialism, which is also the road to their salvation.

Since its establishment, the Party has trusted women. The famous German female Communist Zetkin attended the Tours Congress as a representative of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Moreover, our Party has consistently struggled against all petty-bourgeois prejudices that despise women.

The names of many Communist female heroes, such as Casanova, shine alongside the names of Sémard, Bélli, Carter, and many others.

Speaking of women's activities at the Gennevilliers Congress, Thorez said:

"We are proud that the female members of our party can, under all conditions, express the deep feelings of French women against war from all platforms. It is necessary to praise the spirit of unity, which inspires them, and enables all French women of different faiths and opinions, united by the heroic struggle for peace and the happiness of their children, to cooperate effectively on the basis of mutual trust."

Our party, because it is a party with a future, has naturally always been a party that attracts young people.

Speaking of youth at the Gennevilliers Congress, Thorez clarified the Party's obligations to our country's youth.

"All the young people have put forward the same demands and are engaged in the same struggle for peace and national independence. The young comrades of our French Republican Youth League and the French Young Women's League can count on the support of our entire party to complete the task of uniting all the young people in the struggle for peace and happiness."

Our party, fighting under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, recognizes the great tasks facing our party in the current historical stage, when the warmongers are desperately trying to launch new adventures.

Lenin and Stalin have repeatedly said that the socialist system and the capitalist system can coexist peacefully, but the imperialists are unwilling to have these two systems coexist peacefully.

However, the people want to express their opinions and are able to use concerted action to force the imperialists to achieve this coexistence, that is, to achieve peace.

When Thorez, due to exhaustion and illness from devoting all his efforts to serving the people and the cause of peace, called on us to fight fervently and bravely to defend peace.

We will bear in mind his instructions, which should inspire us in our daily actions: "Communists are not sectarian or insensitive blind followers, as the enemies of the people arbitrarily assert; Communists are advanced warriors, prophets of the future, a new type of human being who strives to persuade all working masses and win them over with his unwavering example of loyalty to the cause of the working masses."

After the movement to collect millions of signatures for the Stockholm Appeal, after the peace defenders worked hard to ensure the success of the provincial congresses before the Second World Peace Congress was convened, it is necessary to continue to make more efforts.

It is necessary to save peace and launch an unremitting and increasingly broad mass struggle. The greater the provocations and threats of the warmongers, the more necessary it is to carry out this struggle.

On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary, the French Communist Party looks to the future with a firm belief in its own strength. It knows that there are arduous battles ahead, but it also knows that the people will win the final victory, and it is proud to lead the people's liberation struggle.

Our party can sum up its activities with pride. Serving the working class for thirty years, serving the people for thirty years, serving the interests of the working masses for thirty years, serving the cause of freedom for thirty years, serving the cause of peace for thirty years - this is why our party has the right to be proud.

And now, our glorious task is to do everything possible to save peace and advance along the road to victory in the great socialist cause, which the heroes of the Paris Commune fought and sacrificed for, and which finally triumphed in the Soviet Union under the banner of Lenin and under the leadership of Stalin.

　　法国共产党的诞生和发展（下）
    法国共产党中央委员会书记  杜克洛
    本着忠于马克思列宁主义原则的精神在多年斗争中成长的法国共产党，蒙受了迫害。当局宣布它非法，以便消灭它，但是，暴风雨却没有能够使它屈服。一九四○年六月六日，它指出了拯救巴黎的途径；一九四○年七月十日，也就是在那已经因为剥夺了共产党人代表权而自败其名的议会宣告共和国沦亡的那一天，它号召进行抵抗。
    在希特勒占领时期，以多列士为首的共产党领导了斗争。有七万五千名共产党员在为法兰西、为共产主义而进行的斗争中倒下去了。
    法国解放后，在总书记领导下的共产党屹立在争取国家复兴的战士的最前列。可是，美帝国主义者却打算利用“马歇尔计划”，接着又利用“北大西洋公约”把魔掌伸进我国来。
    为了进行这种叛卖勾当，就必须把共产党人排出政府。拉马第执行了这一任务。从那时起，法国政府的政策便愈益盲目地服从美帝国主义者企求战争的命令了。
    没有苏联，战胜希特勒是不可能的；但他们却企图发动反苏战争。为了进行这一战争，华盛顿政府就要重新武装西德纳粹分子。
    多列士揭露了那些在朝鲜和越南进行战争、向中华人民共和国进行挑衅并扬言要把全世界投入水深火热之中的人的罪恶计划和他们的反苏战争的准备，多列士用这样的话表达了我国人民的心情：“法国人民不要而且永远不要对苏联作战！”
    现在，当统治阶级企图把我们拖入新战争，企图重新武装德国而再度叛卖法国的利益的时候，他们又遭到了法国共产党，法兰西保卫和平的党的反对。
    当这些统治者希图强迫城乡劳动大众负担实行扩军政策所需的费用时，法国共产党这个法国工人阶级和法国人民的党，便再度起来反抗他们。
    正因为这样，人民的敌人才图谋进行迫害。美国主子命令他们消灭共产党人。一九三九年希特勒也给他们下过同样的命令。可是，越来越多的法国人都了解：如果容许消灭共产党人，那末，接着就会轮到其他一切愿意仍然忠于自由理想的人们被消灭了，那怕他们并不是完全同意共产党人的。正是因为这个原因，法国共产党就越来越成为自由的堡垒了。
    我们来庆祝在我国历史悠久的我党的第三十周年。我们的党是体现法国的传统和崇高理想的党，是工农联盟的党，是力求把我们的《国际歌》中关于“世界的创造者——劳动的工农群众”的光辉词句变成生动的现实的党。
    我们共产党要求耕者有其田，给农民群众指出走向社会主义的道路，也是救助他们的道路。
    党自成立以来就是信任妇女的。著名的德国女共产党员蔡特金曾以共产国际执行委员会代表的身份出席了都尔代表大会。而且我们的党是一贯进行斗争，反对一切轻视妇女的小资产阶级成见的。
    许多共产党女英雄的名字，例如卡桑诺娃，是和瑟马拉、贝利、卡特尔以及其他许多的名字争光齐辉的。
    多列士在让维勒举行的代表大会上说到妇女的活动：
    “我们引以自豪的是：我们党的女党员能在一切条件下从一切讲坛上表示法国妇女起而反对战争的深切情绪。要表扬那种一致的精神，这种精神鼓舞着她们，并使由于争取和平和自己孩子的幸福的英勇斗争而团结起来的一切不同信仰和见解的法国妇女，在相互信任的基础上进行有效合作成为可能。”
    我们的党，因为是有前途的党，自然就一向是吸引青年的党。
    多列士在让维勒代表大会上说到青年时曾阐明了党对我国青年的义务。
    “全体青年提出了同一的要求，进行着争取和平和民族独立的同一斗争。我们的法兰西共和青年联盟和法兰西女青年联盟的青年同志们，是可以指望我们全党支持他们完成在争取和平及幸福的斗争中团结全体青年的任务的。”
    在马列主义旗帜下奋斗的我们的党，认识到：在目前历史阶段，当战争贩子拚命要发动新冒险的时候，我党面临着何等重大的任务。
    列宁和斯大林一再说过社会主义制度与资本主义制度有可能和平共存，但是，帝国主义者却不愿这两个制度和平共存。
    可是，人民要表示自己的意见，并且能够用一致行动来迫使帝国主义者做到这种共存，也就是达到和平。
    多列士由于竭全力为人民及和平事业服务而积劳成疾时，号召我们热烈而勇敢地为保卫和平而斗争。
    我们将牢记他的指示，这一指示应该在我们的日常行动中鼓舞着我们：“共产党人并非像人民的敌人所武断的那样是宗派主义者或是麻木不仁的盲从者；共产党人是先进的战士，是对未来的预言家，是新型的人类，他努力说服一切劳动群众，用自己始终不渝地忠于劳动群众的事业的榜样来争取他们。”
    在为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了数百万签名的运动之后，在和平保卫者为了保证在第二届世界和平大会召开以前省代表大会能够获得成功而努力之后，还必须不断地作更多的努力。
    必须拯救和平，展开不停息的愈益广泛的群众斗争。战争贩子的挑衅和威胁越大，就越需要进行这种斗争。
    在三十周年纪念的时候，法国共产党怀着坚信自己力量的心情来瞻望未来。它知道前面有艰苦的战斗，可是，它也知道人民将赢得最后的胜利，它并以领导人民的解放斗争而自豪。
    我们的党可以怀着自豪的心情来总结自己的活动。为工人阶级服务了三十年，为人民服务了三十年，为劳动群众的利益服务了三十年，为自由事业服务了三十年，为和平事业服务了三十年——这就是我们的党为什么有权利自豪的缘故。
    而现在，我们光荣的工作就是：尽一切可能来拯救和平，沿着巴黎公社的英雄们曾为之奋斗和牺牲的伟大事业，在列宁的旗帜下、在斯大林的领导下终于在苏联胜利了的伟大事业——伟大的社会主义事业获得胜利的道路上前进。
