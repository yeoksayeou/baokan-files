　　People's Governments in Most Areas Emphasize Forest Protection Work
    National Timber Losses Decreased Last Year
    Further Mobilize and Organize the Masses for Fire Prevention and Forest Protection
    [This newspaper reports] Due to the emphasis placed on forest protection by the people's governments in various regions and the mobilization of the masses for fire prevention and forest protection, forest protection work has achieved considerable success over the past year. The extent of forest destruction in various regions has been greatly reduced compared to 1949. In 1949, the timber destroyed by forest fires in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions alone reached 4 million cubic meters, while in 1950, the timber losses nationwide due to forest fires decreased to 2.6 million cubic meters.
    In the past year, leading cadres at all levels of government in most areas have taken the lead in mobilizing the masses to actively prevent forest fires and protect forests, and have established mass-based forest protection organizations. This is the main reason for the success of forest protection work. On April 24th last year, forest fires broke out simultaneously in seven counties, including Dunhua and Antu in Jilin Province. Yu Ke and Xu Yuanquan, vice chairmen of the Jilin Provincial Government, personally led more than 200 cadres and mobilized and organized 20,000 people to go to the mountains. After nine consecutive days and nights of rescue efforts, the mountain fire was extinguished. Sun Shaoliang, the county head of Tieli County in Heilongjiang Province, also led more than 1,000 people to the mountains when a forest fire broke out in the county on April 10th last year. After six consecutive days and nights of tireless work, the forest fire was finally extinguished. During the fire fighting, railway workers such as Wei Shantang and more than 20 others took off their cotton-padded coats and wool sweaters to fight the fire, saving more than 60,000 cubic meters of timber. Muling County in Songjiang Province established a sound mass forest protection organization, strengthened forest protection education for the masses, and enhanced the masses' awareness of loving forests. When a mountain fire broke out last autumn, farmers automatically put down their autumn harvesting work and went to rescue the mountain fire. In 1950, the county's forests were not significantly damaged, and many forest fire prevention and protection models emerged. Wang Qingheng, a forest protection model who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, is one such example.
    However, leading cadres in a few areas have not given enough importance to forest protection work. For example, in the Inner Mongolia region, in the first half of 1950, there was a lack of leadership over fire prevention organizations, so that these organizations did not function when mountain fires occurred, causing forest losses due to untimely rescue. From April 9th to 16th last year, two major fires occurred continuously in the Arxan forest area of the region, burning an area of 7,000 square li and destroying more than 100,000 trees. On April 19th last year, a major fire broke out in the Changshengtun forest area of the Xing'an Nutuke District of Arong Banner. Zhang Kuiliang, the secretary of the CCP District Committee, mobilized women and children to participate in fire fighting in a coercive manner. Due to the lack of organization and education, the masses lacked fire fighting knowledge and experience, resulting in the tragic incidents of people being burned to death and injured.
    In addition, in some areas, destruction by bandits, special agents, and lawless landlords, as well as complacency in the minds of some leading cadres regarding fire prevention and forest protection, have caused losses. Recently, in the Lingling Special District of Hunan, due to the frenzied destruction by bandits, special agents, and lawless landlords, mountain burning incidents occurred in all seven counties except Ningyuan County. In Beijiang Township, Jianghua County alone, more than 200,000 fir trees were burned on February 20th. In April last year, in the first district of Wuzhai, Shanxi, a district cadre discarded a fire when smoking on the mountain, resulting in the burning of more than 200 mu of young forests. These are all issues that should be given serious attention by various regions.

### 大部地区人民政府重视保护森林工作  去年全国林木损失减少  应进一步发动和组织群众防火护林

　　大部地区人民政府重视保护森林工作
    去年全国林木损失减少
    应进一步发动和组织群众防火护林
    【本报讯】一年来的护林工作，由于各地人民政府对保护森林的重视，和发动群众防火护林，已获得相当成绩。各地森林被破坏的程度已比一九四九年大为降低，一九四九年仅东北与内蒙地区被林火烧毁的木材即达四百万立方公尺，而一九五○年全国因林火受到损失的木材，已减少到二百六十万立方公尺。
    在过去一年中，大部地区各级政府的领导干部，以身作则，发动群众积极防火护林，并建立了群众性的护林组织，这是护林工作获得成绩的主要原因。去年四月二十四日吉林敦化、安图等七县同时发生林火，吉林省政府副主席于克、徐元泉曾亲自率领干部二百多人，动员组织了群众二万人上山，经过连续九昼夜的抢救，山火得以扑灭。黑龙江铁骊县县长孙绍良，在该县去年四月十日发生林火时，也领导一千多群众上山，连续六昼夜不眠不歇，终于把林火扑灭。救火时森林铁路工友魏善堂等二十多人，脱下棉袄毛衣打火，抢救了木材六万多立方公尺。松江省穆棱县建立了健全的群众护林组织，加强对群众的护林教育，提高了群众的爱林思想，去年秋季发生山火时，农民自动放下秋收工作，前往抢救山火。该县在一九五○年一年中，森林始终未受到大的损失，并出现了不少防火护林模范。出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的护林模范王清恒，就是一个例子。
    但还有少数地区的领导干部，对护林工作没有足够重视。如内蒙地区，在一九五○年上半年，平时对防火组织缺乏领导，以致发生山火时这些组织不起作用，使森林因抢救不及时而遭受损失。去年四月九日到十六日，该区阿尔山林区连续发生两次大火灾，燃烧面积七千平方华里，损失林木十万株以上。去年四月十九日，阿荣旗兴安努图克区长胜屯林区发生大火，中共区委书记张奎良，用强迫命令方式动员妇女儿童参加打火，由于平时缺乏组织教育，群众没有打火常识与经验，致发生烧死烧伤群众的惨痛事件。
    此外在某些地区，由于土匪、特务和不法地主的破坏，以及某些领导干部对防火护林思想上表现麻痹，以致造成损失。最近湖南零陵专区，因为土匪、特务及不法地主的疯狂破坏，除宁远县外，其他七县都发生了烧山事件，仅江华县贝江乡，二月二十日即烧毁杉木二十余万株。去年四月，山西五寨一区，因区干部上山吸烟丢弃火种，以致烧毁幼林二百余亩。这些都是应该引起各地严重注意的。
