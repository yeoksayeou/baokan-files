With the Strong Support of the People's Government,
    The Yi People of Xikang Complete the Design of a Phonetic Script
    Opening Up a Broad World for the Cultural Development of the Yi People

    In order to implement the policy of developing the languages and scripts of minority nationalities as stated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Central People's Government Southwest Nationalities Visiting Delegation, together with the Xichang District Military Control Commission of Xikang Province and Yi people familiar with the Yi script, completed the design of a phonetic script for the Yi people of Xikang after four months of research. This new Yi script has been tested with good results and has been warmly supported by the Yi people. Yi person Li Shi'an said: "For many years, we have longed for the most scientific and convenient script, and it has only been realized today under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party. I am willing to do my best to promote the new script." Yi students in the Xichang Minority Training Class cheered and celebrated the new script and voluntarily began to learn it. The Xichang District Military Control Commission has decided to conduct experimental teaching of this new script in the ethnic schools and among some cadres to be opened soon in Xichang.

    After the liberation of Xikang, with the increasing improvement of the political and economic lives of the Yi people, there is an urgent need to learn culture; however, only the Bimo (shamans), who account for less than one percent of the population, can use the script of the ethnic group; moreover, there are too few characters in the ethnic script, the fonts are extremely inconsistent, and the structure has no fixed rules. These shortcomings have become a major obstacle to the cultural development of the Yi people. The newly designed script uses Latin letters to spell out the Yi language. This script is extremely easy to learn, remember and use; it is especially suitable for creating new characters. The successful creation of this new script has opened up a broad world for the cultural development of the Yi people.

　　在人民政府大力扶助下
    西康彝族完成拼音文字设计工作
    为彝族人民文化发展开辟了广阔天地
    为贯彻人民政协共同纲领中发展少数民族语言文字的政策，中央人民政府西南各民族访问团与西康省西昌区军事管制委员会和彝族内识彝文者经过四个月的研究，完成了西康彝族拼音文字的设计工作。这种彝族新文字经过实验，效果良好，得到彝族人民热烈的拥护。彝族人士李仕安说：“多少年来我们都渴望着一种最科学、最便利的文字，直到今天在人民政府和共产党的领导下才实现。我愿为推行新文字尽最大的力量。”西昌少数民族训练班的彝族学员都为新文字欢呼庆祝，并自动学习起来。西昌区军事管制委员会已决定将此种新文字在西昌即将开办的民族学校和一部分干部中进行实验教学。
    西康解放后，彝族人民随着政治生活和经济生活的日益提高，迫切需要学习文化；但该族文字只有占人口不到百分之一的比摩（巫师）能够使用；而且该族文字过少，字体极不统一，结构也无固定规律。这些缺点成为彝族文化发展上的极大障碍。新设计的文字是用拉丁文字母根据彝族语言拼写而成。这种文字极便于学习、记忆和使用；尤其适宜于创造新字。这种新文字的创造成功为彝族人民文化的发展开辟了广阔的天地。
