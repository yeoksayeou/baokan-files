Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th. ROK Army soldiers, forcibly conscripted by American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique to wage a war of aggression, have been pouring out their hatred for the American and Rhee gangs since being liberated by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Many of them, after being wounded in battle, were abandoned by the Rhee army in desolate mountains and snow-covered fields, where many died of cold and starvation every day. Fortunately, they were rescued by the arrival of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Fang Yinzan, a former private second class of the 3rd Battalion of the 29th Regiment of the Rhee army, accused: "We have all witnessed the brutal atrocities of the American imperialists in our country, witnessed our parents, brothers, and sisters being massacred and raped, and witnessed more than 20 cities such as Yeoncheon, Pocheon, and Cheorwon, and all the villages and towns on both sides of every highway near the 38th parallel, completely bombed and burned to the ground. No one will forget the blood debt owed by the American army and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique." Park Bong-chun, who used to be an assistant automobile driver in the U.S. 24th Division, said that he saw American soldiers raping women in Daegu every day, and he himself was often forced to steal chickens and pigs from the people and burn their houses for the American soldiers, and was beaten and kicked if he disobeyed. His companion, Choi Chang-deok, was shot to death by an American soldier in a fit of anger. His own hometown of Gimcheon was also burned down by the American bandits last year. His father and brother were both killed and wounded by bombing. However, the American bandits inhumanely said: "Killing a Korean is not as good as killing a chicken, because a chicken can be eaten, but you can only feed the dogs." Kim Soon-cheol, a soldier of the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 29th Regiment of the Rhee army, was from Nam-dong, Daegu City. His younger brother had his lips and tongue cut off by American soldiers last year for singing "General Kim Il-sung's Song," and his elder brother was also killed by the American army. He angrily said: "American imperialists treat Koreans as their slaves and cannon fodder. American bandits are the most ferocious enemies of the Korean people." Li Bingxia was originally from Xingxing-ri, Hamgyongnam-do, North Korea, and was captured by the American army last December. He said: "When we hold weapons in our hands, we know who the guns should be aimed at. I must kill the American invaders!" They all expressed that as soon as their injuries are healed, they will join the Korean People's Army to take revenge on the American aggressors!

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th. Many captured ROK Army soldiers, after a short period of education, have initially recognized the treasonous crimes of the Syngman Rhee gang in colluding with American imperialism, and have actively joined the Korean People's Army to atone for their crimes. They have generally shown a brave and active spirit in combat. In the counterattack in the Hengcheng area, Fei Huozhi, a liberated soldier of the 2nd Detachment of a certain unit of the People's Army, fought bravely and killed or wounded 20 enemies with grenades, and together with two other soldiers, held their position until the enemy was completely repelled. In the same battle, Zheng Yongqiu, a liberated soldier of the same detachment, killed or wounded a total of 13 enemies. The hot barrel of his gun burned his hand due to continuous firing, but he still insisted on shooting. In another battle, Cui Bingji, a liberated soldier of the 2nd Squad of a certain unit, remained on the front line after being wounded, and persisted until the end of the battle. In this battle, he killed or wounded a total of 20 enemies, and persuaded three ROK Army soldiers to surrender by shouting. Sun Xingshan, a liberated soldier of the 2nd Detachment of the 2nd Squad of a certain unit, was once assigned the task of reconnaissance for the advance of the troops. When he discovered that the enemy was hiding in the mountains, he shouted: "I used to be from the 31st Regiment of the 8th Division. After I surrendered to the People's Army, they not only did not kill me, but also treated me kindly. You are following the American invaders and the Syngman Rhee traitors to kill your own compatriots. It's not worth dying. Surrender quickly!" Under his persuasion, 43 soldiers of the 27th Regiment of the 5th Division of the ROK Army immediately raised their hands and surrendered. In the Korean People's Army, many liberated soldiers have now joined the Korean Democratic Youth League after being tested in battle.

　　被解放的李承晚伪军士兵
    痛恨美李匪帮暴行
    纷纷参加人民军队立功赎罪
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】被美帝国主义和李承晚卖国贼强征来进行侵略战争的李承晚伪军士兵，在被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军解放以后，纷纷诉说他们对于美、李匪帮的仇恨。他们之中有许多人在作战负伤后就被李伪军抛弃在荒山雪野中，每天都有很多人冻饿而死。幸亏由于中国人民志愿军的到达他们才得到了解救。原李伪军二十九联队三大队二等兵方尹赞控诉说：“我们都亲眼看到美帝国主义者在我们祖国的残暴兽行，看到自己父母兄弟姊妹们被残杀、被强奸，看到涟川、抱川、铁原等二十多个城市，和靠近三八线南北的每一条公路两旁的所有村镇，全部被炸平烧光。谁都不会忘记美国军队和李承晚卖国贼欠下的这笔血账。”原在美军第二十四师当汽车司机助手的朴凤春说：他在大邱时每日都看到美军强奸妇女，他本人也常被逼着替美军抢老百姓的鸡、猪和烧老百姓的房子，稍有不从即遭拳打脚踢。他的同伴崔昌德就是在美国兵一怒之下被枪杀的。他自己的家乡金泉，在去年也被美国强盗烧光。父亲和哥哥都被炸死与炸伤。可是，美国强盗却毫无人性地说：“杀一个朝鲜人不如杀一只鸡子，鸡子还能吃，你们却只能喂狗。”原李伪军二十九联队三大队九中队士兵金顺哲是大邱市南洞人，他弟弟在去年因唱《金日成将军之歌》而被美国兵割去嘴唇和舌头，他的哥哥也被美军残杀。他愤怒地说：“美帝国主义把朝鲜人当做他们的奴隶，当他们的炮灰，美国强盗是朝鲜人民最凶恶的敌人。”李炳夏原是朝鲜北部咸镜南道新兴里人，是去年十二月里被美军抓去的。他说：“当我们手里拿着武器时，就知道枪口应该朝着谁。我一定要把美国侵略军打死。”他们都表示一俟伤治好后，就要参加朝鲜人民军向美国侵略者报仇！
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】许多被俘的李承晚伪军士兵，经过短期教育以后，初步认识了李承晚匪帮勾结美帝国主义的卖国罪行，纷纷参加朝鲜人民军，立功赎罪。他们在作战中普遍表现了勇敢积极的精神。在横城地区的反击战中，人民军某部第二分队解放战士斐火植奋勇作战，以手榴弹杀伤敌人二十名，并且和另外两个战士坚守阵地，直到把敌人完全击退。在同一次战斗中，该分队解放战士郑永球共杀伤敌人十三名。由于连续射击，发热的枪筒把他的手都烫坏了，但他仍坚持射击。在另一次战斗中，某部二小队解放战士崔炳基负伤后不下火线，一直坚持到战斗胜利结束。他在这次战斗中，共杀伤敌人二十名，并喊话争取了李伪军三人投降。某部二小队二分队解放战士孙兴善，某次担任部队先头搜索任务，发现山上藏着敌人，就喊话说：“我从前是第八师团三十一联队的，我投降人民军以后，他们不但不杀我，还宽待我。你们跟着美国侵略军和李承晚卖国贼残杀自己的同胞，死了多不值得，赶快投降过来吧！”在他的喊话争取下，李伪军第五师二十七联队士兵四十三人即举手投降。朝鲜人民军中，现在已有不少解放战士在经过战斗考验后加入了朝鲜民主青年同盟。
