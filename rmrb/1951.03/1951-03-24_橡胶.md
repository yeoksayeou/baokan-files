　　Rubber is a very important industrial raw material, especially necessary for national defense industries.
　　The rubber trees planted in our country were first introduced from the Malay Peninsula. This type of rubber tree is most suitable for planting in the Hainan Island area. As early as 1907, overseas Chinese brought back rubber tree seeds for trial planting. In 1910, overseas Chinese He Linshu and others jointly formed the Qiongan Rubber Company, opening up 250 mu of land in Luhegou, Ding'an County, Hainan Island, to cultivate and manage rubber trees. Initially, more than 4,000 trees were planted, but only more than 3,200 survived. By 1915, the production of rubber was 500 jin. Thereafter, production increased year by year, reaching more than 3,000 jin by 1918. Its quality was excellent, and it was sold to Singapore and other places at prices no lower than those of Southeast Asian products. Therefore, the number of people planting rubber trees on Hainan Island gradually increased. At present, there are 803 rubber plantations on the island, with a planting area of ​​29,332 mu, a total of 688,224 rubber trees, and 375,223 trees are currently being tapped for rubber latex, producing approximately 7,500 dan of rubber annually. The area suitable for cultivating rubber trees on Hainan Island is very large, estimated at approximately 5,361,475 mu. At the same time, 1,077,754 mu of land on the Leizhou Peninsula is also suitable for planting rubber trees. In the future, with the vigorous cultivation by the People's Government, the supply of rubber raw materials for our country can be largely solved by Hainan Island alone.
　　Rubber is an important industrial raw material. In order to fully prepare and supply the needs of the country's large-scale construction in the future, and in order not to rely on rubber imports, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Agricultural and Forestry Office of the Hainan Island Military and Political Committee have formulated a rubber production increase plan based on the specific conditions of Hainan Island, adopting the policy of vigorous restoration and large-scale development. In 1950, due to the active development of rubber seedling cultivation on Hainan Island, 4.5 million seedlings have been cultivated. In 1951, the specific plan is to increase the planting of rubber trees by 100,000 mu and cultivate seedlings on 500 mu. The Hainan Island Military and Political Committee has now begun to plan the establishment of a Rubber Reclamation Office, with key counties establishing Rubber Reclamation Sections and key areas establishing Rubber Reclamation Stations. To expand the planting area, the People's Government is also extensively running rubber production increase loans and cadre training classes. Efforts are now being made to improve the technology of rubber tapping and rubber making, and equipment is being strengthened. The quality of rubber produced in Shibi, Ding'an County, the main rubber producing area of ​​the island, has increased by 30% compared to the past. The Agricultural and Forestry Office of the Hainan Island Military and Political Committee is also preparing to order a large number of rubber pressing machines and build smoking rooms for rubber farmers to use. Under the correct leadership and strong support of the People's Government, the development of the rubber industry on Hainan Island has a bright future.
　　There are many types of plants containing rubber. In addition to the rubber trees introduced to our country from Malaya, there are also rubber trees introduced to our country from India and a large number of rubber grasses. Indian rubber trees are planted in Sichuan, Yunnan, Taiwan and other places in southwestern China, and they grow very well. However, its quality is not as good as that of rubber produced in Malaya. Rubber grass is a perennial dandelion, a temperate plant. The Soviet Union is now widely using this plant to extract rubber. The production area and yield of this rubber grass in our country are also very large. According to surveys and estimates, rubber grass grows everywhere within a radius of about 100 square kilometers west of Zhaosu County, Yili District, Xinjiang, and south of the Tekes River. According to the results of testing by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, its roots contain 25% rubber. In addition, banyan trees grow in Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, Jiangxi and southern Zhejiang provinces in our country; the yellow bark trees in Sichuan, the Eucommia ulmoides trees in Zhejiang, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces all contain milky sap and can be tested for rubber extraction. Herbaceous plants such as spurge, Euphorbia kansui, bitter lettuce, Celtis and Solidago canadensis all have the value of testing for rubber extraction. Our motherland has such a large area and so many kinds of plants. As long as we conduct extensive experimentation and research in the future, we can solve the need for rubber raw materials in our country.

    橡胶是一种很重要的工业原料，尤为国防工业所必需。
    我国种植的橡胶树，首由马来亚半岛传入。这种橡胶树最适宜种植于海南岛地区。一九○七年即有华侨带回橡胶树种籽试植。一九一○年，有华侨何麟书等人合组成琼安橡胶公司，在海南岛定安县落河沟一带辟地二百五十亩，开始培植、经营。起初栽培了四千多株，但只种活了三千二百余株；到一九一五年产橡胶五百斤，以后产量逐年增加，到一九一八年已产橡胶三千多斤，其品质优良，销售新加坡等地，卖价亦不低于南洋产品。因此海南岛栽植橡胶树的人从此日渐增多。现全岛共有胶园八○三所，种植面积为二九、三三二亩，橡胶树共六八八、二二四株，现已采割橡胶乳液的有三七五、二二三株，每年出产橡胶约七、五○○担。海南岛可以栽培橡胶树的面积很广，据估计约有五、三六一、四七五亩，同时雷州半岛也有一、○七七、七五四亩土地适于种植橡胶树。今后，在人民政府的大力培植之下，我国橡胶原料的供应仅海南岛一地就可解决大部问题。
    橡胶为重要的工业原料，为了充分准备与供给今后国家大规模建设的需要，为了不依赖橡胶进口，中南区军政委员会农林部和海南岛军政委员会农林处已经根据海南岛的具体情况，拟订了橡胶增产计划，采取大力恢复与大量发展的方针。一九五○年由于海南岛积极地开展橡胶育苗工作，已经育成树苗四五○万株，一九五一年具体计划增植橡胶树达十万亩，育苗五百亩。海南岛军政委员会现已开始计划成立橡胶垦植处，各个重点县并成立橡胶垦植科及在各重点地区成立橡胶垦植站。为了扩大种植面积，人民政府还大量举办橡胶增产贷款和干部训练班。在割胶和制胶的技术方面，现在也力求改进，并且要加强设备。该岛橡胶主要产地定安县石壁所出产的橡胶，质量已经比过去提高了百分之三十。海南岛军政委员会农林处并且准备订制大批的压胶机器和建造熏房，贷给胶农使用。在人民政府的正确领导和大力支持之下，今后海南岛橡胶业的发展是有光明前途的。
    含橡胶的植物种类很多，除了从马来亚传入我国橡胶树外，还有从印度传入我国的橡胶树及大量的橡胶草等。印度橡胶树多种在我国西南的四川、云南和台湾等地，生长情形很好。不过它的品质没有马来亚所产橡胶为好。橡胶草是一种多年生长的蒲公英，它是一种寒带的植物，苏联现在就是广泛地利用这种植物提取橡胶。在我国这种橡胶草的产区与产量也是很大的。据调查估计在新疆伊犁区昭苏县城以西、特克斯河以南周围约一百平方公里以内，到处生长着橡胶草。这种草经中央人民政府轻工业部化验的结果，其根部含有橡胶百分之二十五。此外，我国广东、福建、台湾、江西和浙江省南部都生长榕树；四川的黄葛树，浙江、湖北、四川、陕西和甘肃等省的杜仲树，它们都含有乳状的液汁，都可以试验提取橡胶。草本植物的大戟、草?如、甘遂、苦卖菜、苣蒿和一枝黄花等，都有试验提取橡胶的价值。我们祖国的面积这么大，植物的种类这么多，只要今后广泛地试验与研究，是可以解决我国橡胶原料的需要的。
