　　Madame Vaillant-Couturier Writes to Cai Chang
    Expressing Respect to Chinese Women on Behalf of the International Democratic Women's Federation
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, sent a letter to Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation held in Berlin in early February, expressing respect to the Chinese women who have made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace. The original letter is as follows:
    Dear Madame Cai Chang:
    We warmly thank you for your encouragement to the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation. We all feel it is a great pity that you could not attend this meeting.
    This Berlin Council meeting is convened at a time when the imperialist warmongers are threatening our families and the lives of our children with unprecedented severity. The warmongers are desperately carrying out a barbaric massacre of the innocent, peace-loving Korean people. The U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, who are concentrating all their efforts to finally launch a third world war, are making the danger of war more acute by rearming West Germany.
    The Second World Peace Congress has confirmed to us that the powerful and invincible forces of peace throughout the world are constantly growing. The fact that French imperialism prohibits the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation is clear evidence that the imperialist war instigators fear the power of the women's democratic movement. The imperialists' attempts to strangle the growing people's forces striving for peace are futile.
    In view of the urgency of the situation, the Council calls on women of all classes and with all political and religious beliefs to actively oppose all war preparations in various ways and in all aspects, especially against the rearmament of West Germany.
    Our Chinese sisters, loyal to the traditions of our great country, have made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace. The extensive support movement launched by Chinese women for their Korean sisters and women around the world has inspired our common struggle for peace and the happiness of children. We would like to extend our warm regards to the heroic Chinese men and women volunteers who are fighting side by side with the Korean people today, striving for national independence, opposing imperialism, and defending peace.
    The Council extends its deep gratitude to you and all Chinese women for your struggle to win a free, peaceful, and happy world for all mankind.
    Wishing you good health and sending you warm and sincere greetings.
                            Yours sincerely, Vaillant-Couturier, Berlin, February 5th

　　古久里夫人写信给蔡畅
    代表国际妇联向我国妇女致敬
    【新华社讯】国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人致函中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅，代表二月初在柏林举行的国际民主妇联理事会向对于保卫世界和平事业作了重大贡献的中国妇女致敬。原函如下：亲爱的蔡畅夫人：
    我们热烈地感谢你给国际民主妇联理事会的鼓励。我们大家都感到你不能参加这次会议是莫大遗憾。
    这次柏林理事会议的召开，是在帝国主义战争贩子空前严重地威胁着我们的家庭和我们孩子们的生命的时候。战争贩子们正在绝望中对无辜的、爱好和平的朝鲜人民实行野蛮的屠杀。正集中全力以图最后掀起第三次大战的美帝国主义者和他们的同伙对西德的重新武装，使战争的危险更尖锐化了。
    二届世界和平大会向我们证实了：全世界强大无敌的和平力量正在不断增长。法帝国主义者禁止国际妇联的活动，就是帝国主义战争挑拨者惧怕妇女民主运动力量的明证。帝国主义者企图绞杀与日俱增的争取和平的人民力量，那只是徒劳的。
    理事会鉴于局势的紧迫，号召各阶层、各种政治宗教信仰的妇女们，用各种方式，在各方面积极反对一切战争准备，尤其是反对重新武装西德。
    忠诚于伟大国家的传统的我们中国姊妹，为保卫世界和平事业作了重大贡献。中国妇女对朝鲜姊妹和世界各地妇女们发动的广大支援运动，鼓舞了我们为争取和平与儿童幸福的共同斗争。我们谨向今天和朝鲜人民并肩作战、争取民族独立、反对帝国主义、保卫和平的中国英勇的男女志愿军致热烈敬礼。
    对于你们为全人类争取一个自由、和平与幸福的世界而进行的斗争，理事会谨向你和全中国妇女致深深的谢忱。
    祝你健康，并致热烈真挚的敬礼。
                            你的诚挚的古久里  二月五日，柏林
