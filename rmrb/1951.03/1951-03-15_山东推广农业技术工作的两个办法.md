Two Methods for Promoting Agricultural Technology Work in Shandong

Zhong Xingfan, Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry

Shandong Province is a relatively old region with a certain foundation in agricultural production. However, due to insufficient work in the previous stage on technology promotion, especially in earnestly summarizing the production experience of the masses to integrate technology with the masses, the achievements in technological improvement work were not significant. Many mutual aid organizations, due to their failure to combine with technology, became impoverished in content and degenerated into formalism.

There are many reasons why we did not do a good job in technology promotion work in the past, but the basic reason is that the thinking of general agricultural workers is still not unified, so the strength is dispersed, and even mutually restrained, which greatly affects the development of the work. Some agricultural workers believe that farmers are "conservative" and "backward" and do not accept new technologies. Therefore, they do not consider local conditions and the needs of the masses, but only rely on their own set of instructions to guide farmers. When they are out of touch with the needs of farmers and have to complete the task, they will inevitably form coercion and command, which is not welcomed by farmers. Some cadres who have lived in rural areas for a long time or are from peasant backgrounds only see that individual inexperienced and low-level technical personnel cannot solve any problems, so they doubt and ignore technology, and even deny technology. The above two kinds of thinking are the basic resistance to technology promotion work.

In fact, among the farmers who have been engaged in agricultural production for many years, not only are there rich and valuable experiences, but also new creations. For example, a farmer buried sweet potato seedlings in a cellar, and planting them the following year still yielded melons; in preventing wheat bunt and stinking smut, farmers created a seeding device that separated manure and seeds; Yu Qingshou in Wendeng, Jiaodong cultivated flat-eared wheat, which increased production by 20% compared with ordinary wheat, and has been promoted in several counties; "Baolan Dian" is also the result of a farmer's cultivation and selection for more than 20 years. These valuable experiences and creations need to be scientifically analyzed, researched, improved, and promoted by us. Every agricultural scientific worker must first overcome the idea that the masses are "backward," and learn from the masses' valuable experiences and the problems they need to solve with the attitude of a primary school student, to enrich themselves, and use this as a foundation to help farmers and improve their technology. On the other hand, every cadre should believe in science, attach importance to technology, and never emphasize individual phenomena and ignore the role of technology, let alone reject scientific guidance based on one-sided experience.

Only by correcting the above two kinds of thinking in time, so that all agricultural workers can closely combine and unify their steps, will it be possible to combine technology with the experience of farmers, inspire and improve each other. Therefore, in order to do a good job in technical improvement, we have adopted the following two methods:

  I. Holding technical training classes:

    The county people's government and farms are the main bodies. During the slack farming season in winter and spring, short-term agricultural technology training classes are held according to the needs of local farmers to improve their technical level. This is a relatively successful new leadership method. In the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950, more than 27,000 village cadres, labor models, production activists, mutual aid team leaders, and winter school teachers were trained in 25 counties. The trained farmers played a certain role in promoting the improvement of agricultural production technology and ensuring the completion of the grain and cotton production increase tasks in the 1950 production campaign. At the same time, the relationship between farms and labor models and production activists in various places has been further strengthened. Wendeng Special District trained 9,700 people, promoting 90% of the wheat fields in the whole district to hoe wheat two to three times, and 190,000 mu of saline-alkali land were pressed with sand; in the summer and autumn seed selection campaign, the trained farmers mostly participated in the regional and village seed selection committees, promoting and guiding the masses to carry out technical work such as field seed selection and removal of diseased plants. They also played a leading role in organizing well digging, lending water trucks, accumulating fertilizer, and introducing improved varieties.

    Since training farmers is a new task, before the start of training, the cadres and technicians of the Construction Section of the County People's Government and the farms, and the production assistants of various districts, should conduct research and study on technology promotion, and then select a district or village with good conditions as the focus of training, and hold one or two sessions in combination with local conditions to obtain experience, and then organize forces to carry out separately. The training time is three to five days for each session, and the number of students should not be too large. Through explanation and discussion, we will study several urgent and possible technical problems in current production. There are two ways: most counties send students to go out in the morning and return at night, and the county and district cadres responsible for training also lead farmers to conduct discussions in the village; the other is to mobilize students to bring their own food and concentrate on training. The determination of teaching materials should start from the needs of the masses, with the improvement of production technology as the main task, improve the production experience of farmers, and combine scientific knowledge with the practical experience of farmers, so that the masses can easily accept it.

  II. Organize a promotion network with farms as the main body

    Based on the urgent requirements of labor models for technology, in 1947, Wendeng Farm absorbed the labor models near the farm to organize an agricultural technology research association, with labor model Zhang Fugui and the farm director serving as the director and deputy director respectively. They used the market period to hold meetings every half a month, and studied one or two problems that needed to be solved urgently in a very short time. The farm introduced the crops demonstrated in the farm according to the season, and introduced scientific knowledge to the labor models with examples. At the same time, they absorbed the experience of the labor models to enrich the farm's demonstration work, so it was deeply welcomed by the labor models. In 1948, it had developed to ten districts and organized four agricultural technology research associations, with a total of 28 county and district labor models participating. In the winter of 1949, the original agricultural technology research association was renamed as a promotion station. With the support of the administration, agricultural technology research associations were universally established in various districts (there are now five promotion stations and fifteen agricultural technology research associations). The members established agricultural technology research groups in their respective villages. The agricultural technology research association in the district is composed of seven to nine labor models and production activists, and a labor model with prestige is selected as the director, and the district head is the deputy director. The directors of the agricultural technology research associations and the district assistants hold meetings at the promotion station on a regular basis. Farm cadres often control the base points near the farm to create experience, and regularly cooperate with the cadres of the Construction Section to participate in the meetings at the promotion stations to convey the opinions of the government and absorb the experience of the labor models. This organization is one of the methods that combines demonstration and promotion from top to bottom and absorption of opinions from bottom to top, and it can also enable the participating labor models to not delay production, so it has a great effect on improving the production technology of the masses, and it is planned to be universally promoted throughout the province this year.

　　山东推广农业技术工作的两个办法
    山东省农林厅副厅长  仲星帆
    山东省是一个较老的地区，农业生产工作也较有基础，但因前一阶段对技术推广工作，尤其认真总结群众的生产经验使技术与群众相结合的工作作的不够，以致技术改进工作成绩不大。好多变工组织由于未与技术相结合，以致内容贫乏，而流于形式主义。
    过去我们对技术推广工作没有作好的原因固然很多，但基本原因还在于一般农业工作者的思想尚不一致，所以力量分散，甚至互相牵制，大大影响了工作的开展。有些农业工作者认为农民“保守”、“落后”不接受新的技术。因此，他们不考虑当地条件与群众的需要，只凭自己的一套去指导农民，当和农民需要脱节而又要完成任务的情况下，便必然形成强迫命令，不为农民所欢迎。也有些久住农村或农民出身的干部，只看到个别经验不足，水平不高的技术人员解决不了什么问题，便怀疑和忽视技术，甚至否定技术。以上两种思想是技术推广工作上的基本阻力。
    事实上，在从事农业生产已有若干年代的农民中间，不仅蕴藏着丰富的宝贵经验，而且也有着新的创造。例如，一个农民把地瓜秧藏在地窖里，第二年栽上一样结瓜；在防除小麦腥黑穗时，农民创造了粪种隔离的播种器；胶东文登于青绶培育了扁穗麦，比一般小麦增产二成，并已推广了数县的面积；“宝蓝点”，也是一个农民二十余年的培育评选结果。这些宝贵的经验与创造，都有待我们予以科学的分析研究，提高和推广的。每个农业科学工作者，必须首先克服认为群众“落后”的思想，并以作小学生的态度放下架子，去了解学习群众中的宝贵经验与要求解决的问题，以充实自己，并以此作基础去帮助农民与提高农民的技术。另一方面，每个干部都应该相信科学，重视技术，绝不能强调个别现象而忽视技术的作用，更不能凭借片面经验，而拒绝科学指导。
    只有及时纠正以上两种思想，使所有农业工作者密切结合，统一步调，也才有可能使技术与农民的经验结合起来，互相启发与提高。因此，为了作好技术改进的工作，我们曾采取了下面的两种办法：
  一、举办技术训练班：
    以县人民政府和农场为主，利用冬春农闲期间，根据当地农民需要，办农业技术短期训练班，以提高农民的技术水平。这是一个比较成功的新的领导方法。一九四九年冬和一九五○年春，先后在二十五个县内训练了村干部、劳动模范，生产积极分子、互助组长、冬学教师等两万七千多人。经过训练的农民，在一九五○年的生产运动中，对推广改进农业生产技术，保证完成粮棉增产任务，起了一定的推动作用。同时，使各地农场和劳动模范，生产积极分子的关系进一步密切起来。文登专区训练了九千七百人，推动全区锄麦二遍到三遍的占全部麦田的百分之九十，咸地压沙达十九万亩；在夏秋选种运动中受训农民，大部参加区村评选良种委员会，推动与指导群众进行田间选种拔除病株等技术工作。在组织打井、贷水车、积肥及引进良种工作上，也起了带头推动作用。
    由于训练农民是一个新的工作，因此，在开始训练前，县人民政府建设科与农场的干部、技术人员和各区生产助理员等，应进行技术推广的研究和学习，然后，选择一个条件好的区或村，作为训练的重点，结合当地情况举办一期或两期，取得经验后，再组织力量分头进行。训练时间，每期三、五天，学员不宜太多，通过讲解与座谈，研究当前生产上几个迫切需要而又可能解决的技术问题。其方式有两种：多数县份学员朝出夜归，负责训练的县、区干部亦分别随学员到村领导农民座谈，另一种是动员学员自带给养集中训练。教材的确定应从群众需要出发，以提高生产技术为主，将农民的生产经验加以提高，使科学知识与农民的实际经验相结合，这样作，群众最易接受。
  二、以农场为主组织推广网
    基于劳动模范对技术的迫切要求，一九四七年文登农场，吸收所在地附近的劳动模范组织了农业技术研究会，以劳动模范张富贵和农场场长分任正副主任，利用集期每半月开会一次，以很短时间研究急需解决的一两个问题，并由农场按季节介绍场内示范的作物，以实例向劳动模范介绍科学知识，同时吸取劳动模范的经验以充实农场的示范工作，所以深得劳动模范的欢迎。一九四八年曾发展到十个区，组织了四个农业技术研究会，共有县、区劳动模范二十八人参加。一九四九年冬季，将原有农业技术研究会改名为推广站，通过行政的支持，各区普遍成立了农业技术研究会（现已有五个推广站、十五个农业技术研究会），会员们在所在村成立农业技术研究小组。区的农业技术研究会是由七至九个劳动模范、生产积极分子组成，选一个有威信的劳动模范为主任，区长为副主任。农业技术研究会主任和区助理员按期到推广站开会，农场干部经常在农场附近掌握基点，以创造经验，并按期协同建设科干部分别到推广站参加会议，传达政府的意见和吸取劳动模范的经验。这一组织，正是自上而下地示范推广和自下而上地吸取意见相结合的办法之一，又能使参加的劳动模范并不耽误生产，因而对提高群众的生产技术作用很大，今年拟在全省范围内普遍推广。
