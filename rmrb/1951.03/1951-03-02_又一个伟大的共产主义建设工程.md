　　Another Great Communist Construction Project
　　Li He, Du Yi
　　On the eve of the New Year in 1951, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union announced a new decision to complete the Volga-Don Canal project two years ahead of schedule and to accelerate the irrigation project in the Rostov and Stalingrad regions. While the plan to transform nature by planting farmland protective forest belts is still underway, a series of great communist construction projects have been announced one after another. This shows the extent of the economic and technological power that the Soviet Union, the world's peace fortress, has achieved after completing the first post-war Five-Year Plan.

　　I

　　The Volga River is the largest river in Europe, originating in the Valdai Hills between Leningrad and Moscow and flowing southeast into the Caspian Sea. The volume of freight transported by the Volga River and its tributaries is almost equal to the total transportation volume of all other rivers in the Soviet Union. However, the natural conditions of the Volga River are such that, apart from the Caspian Sea, there are no waterways to the open sea. However, the Soviet people are the best at transforming nature. Before the war, the Soviet Union had already used the Upper Volga Canal, the Tikhvin Canal, the Mariinsk Canal, the North Dvina Canal, and the White Sea-Baltic Canal to connect the northwestern end of the Volga River to the White Sea and the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. These canals were damaged by the Hitler invaders during the war, but they have been completely restored after the war. The Don River is a large river in southern Russia, flowing south from the southern Moscow region into the Sea of Azov, which is connected to the Black Sea. Therefore, connecting the Volga River and the Don River is equivalent to connecting the waterways of five seas—the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the White Sea. This is of great benefit to strengthening the exchange of coal from the Donbass, oil from Baku, grain from Ukraine and southern Russia, timber from northern Russia, and industrial products from the Urals.

　　The plan to connect the Volga River and the Don River with a canal was drawn up by Soviet engineers under the direction of Marshal Stalin. This plan had already begun to be implemented before the war. The invasion of the Hitler gang temporarily interrupted it. However, even during the war, design and planning work continued according to Stalin's instructions. This construction project started again in 1948. Now it has been decided to complete it two years ahead of schedule, within this year.

　　II

　　There is a place where the lower reaches of the Volga River and the lower reaches of the Don River have parallel and very close water flows. The navigable canal under construction is being excavated here—from the Red Army City south of Stalingrad on the west bank of the Volga River to the town of Kalach-na-Donu south of Stalingrad on the east bank of the Don River. The terrain west of Stalingrad is higher, 130 to 240 meters above the Volga River's water level, so the Red Army City with lower terrain was chosen as the starting point.

　　The canal project is huge. The canal is 101 kilometers long, only 45 kilometers of which have small river channels that can be used by setting up dams. The remaining 56 kilometers must be completely excavated manually. Due to the uneven terrain, when the canal is navigable in the future, the water level of the eastern section will still be 88 meters higher than the Volga River and 44 meters higher than the Don River. The ships traveling from the lower Volga River to the higher canal and then to the lower Don River will rely on the help of thirteen huge locks. Six large iron bridges will be built across the canal for trains and cars to pass. The equipment of the canal buildings is all electrified, and its management is automatic, that is, centralized control.

　　The 101-kilometer canal and its thirteen locks, three dams, pumping stations, docks, bridges, and other buildings must be completed this year. The canal is not very wide, but it is very deep. When it opens to navigation next spring, it will be able to accommodate ships carrying 500 passengers. These ships have restaurants, dance music halls, movie theaters, children's playrooms, swimming pools, billiard rooms, photography studios, etc.

　　III

　　From Stalingrad to Rostov there are 540 kilometers, of which more than 400 kilometers are the original lower reaches of the Don River, except for the 101 kilometers of canal under construction. The riverbed there is not deep, which is not convenient for ships to navigate. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the Don River channel from the town of Kalach-na-Donu, which connects the canal, to Rostov. Thus, the construction of the huge Tsimlyansk Reservoir project has become part of the overall project of building a navigable route from the Volga River to the Don River.

　　The section of the Don River about 180 kilometers long from the town of Kalach-na-Donu south to the village of Tsimlyanskaya is the location for the construction of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir. Near the village of Tsimlyanskaya, a large dam will be built across the Don River to store the river water after the snow melts in the spring, so as not to let it flow into the Sea of Azov in vain as before. After the construction is completed, the Tsimlyansk Reservoir will be 30 kilometers wide, with a volume of 12.6 billion cubic meters, and the water level will be raised by 26 meters. Building dams to raise the water level can reduce the amount of excavation work.

　　The Tsimlyansk Dam is 13.5 kilometers long, of which 12.8 kilometers will be earth-filled, 500 meters will be concrete-built, and 200 meters will be the source of the hydroelectric power station, locks, fish farm, and the Don River Main Canal. The concrete-built dam will be 40 meters high, built on sandy ground, and can discharge 20,000 cubic meters of water per second. There are railways and highways on the dam connecting the traffic lines on both sides of the Don River. The Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Power Station will be equipped with four generators, each with a power generation capacity of 40,000 kilowatts, totaling 160,000 kilowatts. Ports will be established at both the north and south ends of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir: the village of Tsimlyanskaya and the town of Kalach-na-Donu. Many docks will be set up along the coast around the reservoir.

　　In this way, the construction of the Tsimlyansk water conservancy project has three benefits in one fell swoop: the benefit of navigation, the benefit of irrigation, and the benefit of power supply. The entire Tsimlyansk water conservancy project will be completed this year and put into use next spring.

　　IV

　　Related to the construction of the navigable route from the Volga River to the Don River is the irrigation project to be gradually completed from 1951 to 1956. The irrigated area includes 600,000 hectares of land in the Rostov region and 150,000 hectares of land in the southern Stalingrad region. In addition, it is necessary to ensure the water supply for 1 million hectares of land in each of the two regions. Originally, the grassland area on the southeast bank of the Don River was very suitable for farming. There are fertile black soil and chestnut soil, sufficient sunshine and warm climate; only lack of water. The establishment of an irrigation system will fundamentally transform agriculture and animal husbandry there and greatly increase their productivity.

　　The largest irrigation project is the Don River Main Canal. Its source starts directly from the Tsimlyansk Dam (the water from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir is divided into two streams after passing through the Tsimlyansk Dam's lock and hydroelectric power station, one stream flows to the lower reaches of the Don River, and the other stream flows into the Don River Main Canal) and will extend south to the Proletarskaya Reservoir (which is part of the Manych Waterway), with a total length of 190 kilometers. There is a section of highland in the middle of the Don River Main Canal, between the Don River and the Sal River, which will be connected through underground canals. The Don River Main Canal also branches into several canals: (1) the Lower Don River Canal, parallel to the lower reaches of the Don River, 73 kilometers long; (2) the Upper Sal River Canal, using the upper reaches of the Sal River bed, 125 kilometers long; (3) the Bagayevsk Canal, parallel to the lower reaches of the Sal River, 35 kilometers long; (4) the Sadkovsky Canal, parallel to the Bagayevsk Canal, 15 kilometers long; (5) the water from the Don River Main Canal merges with the Manych Lake Waterway in the village of Proletarskaya, and a Azov Canal, 90 kilometers long, is opened south of Manych. In this way, all the land between the south bank of the lower reaches of the Don River to the Sal River and the Manych Waterway will be irrigated. The area east of the Don River Main Canal has a higher terrain and is irrigated by pumps.

　　In addition, a Yergenninsky Canal is excavated from the south bank of the canal connecting the Volga River and the Don River, forming a T-shape with the canal, 140 kilometers long, taking water from the canal. To the west of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir, a Tsimlyansk Canal, 90 kilometers long, is opened, taking water from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir. These two canals on both sides of the Don River will irrigate large areas of land in the southern Stalingrad region.

　　V

　　Canals, reservoirs, and canals are all huge projects. In order to build the above-mentioned Volga-Don waterway and the canals for the first batch of irrigation of 100,000 hectares, it is necessary to excavate 164 million cubic meters of earth and lay 2.86 million cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete. The construction project is highly mechanized. The degree of mechanization of major projects is 90%, and the degree of mechanization of excavation projects is 97%.

　　The Soviet Union is a country capable of manufacturing extremely efficient machines. The Ural-made excavator used in this construction can dig 14 cubic meters of earth at a time and millions of cubic meters of earth a year. This huge machine weighs 1,100 tons, can move automatically, and can dig 30 meters deep mud in swamps. Academician Zhudakov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences described a super-type automatically mobile excavator manufactured by the New Kramatorsk Factory in this way: it is taller than a nine-story building, weighs several thousand tons, has tens of thousands of steel parts, and is equipped with 44 generators. The total power generation capacity is 6,000 kilowatts, and the electricity used is as much as that used by a city in Poltava. The management is electrified, and one scoop can dig up 15 cubic meters of soil, and the soil dug out in one day and night can fill more than 2,000 train cars.

　　In order to carry out construction, 392 kilometers of railways and 468 kilometers of highways have been built locally, 626 kilometers of high-voltage power lines and 467 kilometers of low-voltage power lines have been erected, and 1.5 million cubic meters of workers' residences and public houses have been built. In order to carry out construction, three repair shops, eleven mechanical factories, seven automatic mechanized concrete factories and stone factories have been opened locally. The equipment of these concrete factories is automatic: automatic weighing, separating, mixing and conveying, and can produce 1.76 million cubic meters of concrete a year. The stone factory can produce 1.6 million cubic meters of stone a year.

　　The construction project is in full swing. Excavation work is underway at the canal site. Excavation and dam construction are underway at the Tsimlyansk Reservoir site. The Don River Main Canal, the underground canal, the Lower Don River Canal, and the Azov Canal have all been excavated. The people of the whole Soviet Union warmly support this great construction project, and the morale of the local workers is particularly high. Stakhanovite worker Xie Mark, who used an excavator, originally planned to excavate 48,000 cubic meters of soil in one month, but as a result, he excavated 95,000 cubic meters. It is equivalent to the work of 30,000 ordinary excavators.

　　The area between the Volga River and the Don River is the bloody battlefield where the fascist German army fought during the Soviet Patriotic War. It was from Stalingrad that the heroic Soviet army launched an attack, encircling and annihilating Paulus' army of 330,000 people. At this turning point in the victory of progressive mankind, a great communist project is about to emerge. The Hitler gang, which was emulated by American imperialism, has long been eliminated, but the Soviet Union, the Volga River, and the Don River are becoming increasingly prosperous!

　　又一个伟大的共产主义建设工程
    李何　独伊
    一九五一年新年前夕，苏联部长会议宣布了新的决定，提前两年完成伏尔加河——顿河运河的工程和加速进行罗斯多夫州斯大林格勒州的灌溉工程。当改造自然的种植农田防护林带的计划还在进行的时候，一连串伟大的共产主义建设工程的计划接二连三地宣布了。这就说明了世界和平堡垒苏联在完成了战后第一届五年计划之后，经济力量和技术力量已强大到什么程度。
            一
    伏尔加河是欧洲最大的一条河，发源于列宁格勒与莫斯科之间的瓦尔达伊高地，向东南流入里海。伏尔加河和它的支流的货运数量，几等于苏联全国其他河流运输量的总和。但是伏尔加河的自然条件是除了里海之外，没有通达外海的航路。然而苏联人民是最会改造自然的。战前苏联已经用上瓦洛茨克运河、齐赫文运河、马丽因运河、北土味那运河、白海——波罗的海运河，使伏尔加河的西北端通达白海和波罗的海的芬兰湾。这些运河战时曾遭希特勒侵略者破坏，但战后又完全恢复了。顿河是南俄罗斯的大河，从莫斯科州南部向南流入与黑海衔接的亚速海。因此，把伏尔加海和顿河联接起来，就等于把五个海——黑海、亚速海、里海、波罗的海、白海的航路贯通起来，这对于加强顿巴斯的煤、巴库的石油、乌克兰和南俄的粮食、俄罗斯北部的木材和乌拉尔的工业产品的交流，是大有好处的。
    用一条运河把伏尔加河和顿河联接起来的计划，是苏联工程师根据斯大林大元帅的指示而拟订的。这个计划在战前已经开始实施。希特勒匪帮的侵略暂时打断了它。但是，甚至在战争期间，按照斯大林的指示，设计筹划的工作还是进行着的。一九四八年这一建筑工程又动工了。现在决定提早两年而在今年内完成它。
            二
    伏尔加河下游和顿河下游有一块两河并行水流很近的地方。建筑中的可以通航轮船的运河，就是选定在这儿开凿，——从伏尔加河西岸斯大林格勒市之南的红军城，到斯大林格勒市遥遥相对的顿河东岸的卡拉奇镇之南。斯大林格勒市以西的地势较高，高过伏尔加河的水位一百三十到二百四十公尺，所以选地势较低的红军城为起点。
    运河的工程是巨大的。运河全程一○一公里，只有四十五公里有小河道，可以设立堤坝加以利用。其余五十六公里完全要用人工开掘。由于地势不平，将来运河通航时，靠东头的一段水位仍高过伏尔加河八十八公尺，高过顿河四十四公尺。行驶的轮船，从较低的伏尔加河到较高的运河再到较低的顿河，要靠十三座巨大的水闸的帮助。跨越着运河，将建筑六座大铁桥，通行火车和汽车。运河建筑物的装备都是电气化的，而对它的管理是自动的，即集中操纵的。
    一○一公里运河和它的十三座水闸，三条堤、抽水站、码头、桥梁和其他建筑物，都要在今年完工。运河不很宽，但很深。明年春天开航的时候，将通行可载乘客五百人的轮船。这种轮船上有餐厅、跳舞音乐厅、电影厅、儿童游戏室、游泳池、弹子房、照相馆等等。
            三
    从斯大林格勒市到罗斯多夫市有五百四十公里，除了一百零一公里是在建筑中的运河外，还有四百多公里都是原来顿河的下游。那里河床不深，不便轮船航行。因此必须改善从衔接运河的卡拉奇镇到罗斯多夫市的顿河河道。这样，建筑巨大的齐姆良蓄水池的工程，便成为建筑伏尔加河通达顿河的航线的总工程的一部分。
    由卡拉奇镇顺顿河南下到齐姆良斯卡雅村，约一百八十公里长的一段顿河，便是建筑叫做齐姆良蓄水池的所在。在齐姆良斯卡雅村附近，横断顿河将建筑一座大堤，把溶雪春汛后的河水积蓄起来，不使它像以前那样白白流到亚速海。建筑完成后的齐姆良蓄水池宽达三十公里，容积达一百二十六亿立方公尺，水位将提高二十六公尺。筑堤来提高水位，可以减少挖土的工程。
    齐姆良堤长十三点五公里，其中十二点八公里将是土筑的，五百公尺将是混凝土筑的，二百公尺将是水电站、水闸、渔场和顿河总水渠的源头。混凝土所筑的堤将高达四十公尺，是在沙地上筑起来的，每秒钟能放水二万立方公尺。堤上有铁路和公路联接顿河两岸的交通线。齐姆良水电站将安置四部发电机，每部发电能力四万千瓦，共十六万千瓦。齐姆良蓄水池的南北两端：齐姆良斯卡雅村和卡拉奇镇都将设立口埠。蓄水池周围沿岸将设立许多码头。
    这样，齐姆良水利工程的建筑，一举而有三利：航行之利，灌溉之利，电力供应之利。全部齐姆良水利工程要在今年完成，明年春天开始使用。
            四
    和建筑伏尔加河通达顿河的航线相联系的，是要在一九五一年到一九五六年逐步完成的灌溉工程。灌溉的区域包括罗斯多夫州的六十万公顷土地和斯大林格勒州南部的十五万公顷土地。此外，要保证供给两州各一百万公顷土地的用水。本来，顿河东南岸草原地带，很适宜农稼。那里有肥沃的黑土和栗色土壤，有充足的阳光和暖和的气候；只是缺水。灌溉系统的建立，将根本改造那儿的农业、牧畜业，大大提高它们的生产率。
    最大的灌溉工程是顿河总水渠。它的源头直接从齐姆良堤开始（齐姆良蓄水池的水，经过齐姆良堤的水闸水电站后分为两股，一股流向顿河下游，一股流入顿河总水渠）将向南一直通到普罗列塔斯卡雅蓄水池（它是马内茨水道的一部分），全长一百九十公里。顿河总水渠中间有一段高地，在顿河和萨尔河之间，将经过地下水渠来联接。顿河总水渠又分出几条支渠：（一）下顿河水渠，与顿河下游平行，长七十三公里；（二）上萨尔河水渠，利用萨尔上游河床，长一百二十五公里；（三）巴加耶夫斯克水渠，和萨尔河下游平行，长三十五公里；（四）萨德科夫斯基水渠，和巴加耶夫斯克水渠平行，长十五公里；（五）顿河总水渠的水，在普罗列塔斯卡雅村跟马内茨湖水道汇合，在马内茨以南开一条亚速水渠，长九十公里。这样，顿河下游南岸到萨尔河，马内茨水道之间的全部土地，都得到灌溉。顿河总水渠以东地区，地势较高，都用抽水机来灌溉。
    此外，从联接伏尔加河顿河的运河南岸，开凿一条耶尔根宁斯克水渠，和运河成丁字形，长一百四十公里，从运河取水。在齐姆良蓄水池之西，开一条齐尔斯克水渠，长九十公里，从齐姆良蓄水池取水。这两条在顿河两岸的水渠，将使斯大林格勒州南部大片土地得到灌溉。
            五
    运河、蓄水池、水渠等都是浩大的工程。为了建筑上述伏尔加河和顿河的航线和第一批灌溉十万公顷用的水渠，就得挖掘一亿六千四百万立方公尺的土方，打下二百八十六万立方公尺的混凝土和钢筋混凝土。建筑工程是高度机械化的。各主要工程机械化的程度达百分之九十，挖土工程机械化的程度达百分之九十七。
    苏联是能够自制效率极高的机器的国家。在这次建筑中使用的乌拉尔制的挖土机，一次能挖土十四立方公尺，一年能挖土几百万立方公尺，这种庞大的机器重一千一百吨，能够自动移动，能够在泥沼地里挖出三十公尺深的烂泥。新克拉马托尔斯克工厂制造的一种超型的自动移动的挖土机，苏联科学院院士朱达科夫对它作过这样的描写：它高比九层楼，重达几千吨，钢铁制的零件数万件，安装着发电机四十四部，总发电能力六千千瓦，所用的电力有波尔塔瓦一个城用的那么多，管理是电气化的，一斗能挖起十五立方公尺的泥土，一昼夜挖出的土能装两千多火车厢。
    为了进行建筑，当地已修了三百九十二公里的铁路和四百六十八公里的公路，架了六百二十六公里的高压电线和四百六十七公里的低压电线，盖了一百五十万立方公尺的工人住宅和公用房屋。为了进行建筑，当地已开设了三个修理厂，十一个机械厂，七个自动机械化的混凝土工厂和打石工厂等等。这些混凝土工厂的设备都是自动的：自动秤、分、混和与输送，一年能出产一百七十六万立方公尺的混凝土。打石厂一年能出产一百六十万立方公尺的石块。
    建筑工程正在全面地积极进行着。运河所在地进行着挖土工作。齐姆良蓄水池所在地进行着挖土和筑堤工作。顿河总水渠、地下水渠、下顿河水渠、亚速水渠均已在开掘。全苏人民热烈支持这一伟大建筑工程，当地工人的情绪特别高涨。运用挖土机的斯塔哈诺夫式工人谢马克，原定一个月挖土四万八千立方公尺，结果挖了九万五千立方公尺。等于三万个普通挖土工人的工作。
    伏尔加河和顿河之间的地带，正是苏联卫国战争中法西斯德军喋血的战场，正是英勇的苏军从斯大林格勒出击，包围和歼灭鲍鲁斯军团三十三万人的地方。在这进步人类走向胜利的转折点的地方，即将出现一个伟大的共产主义工程。美帝国主义所效法的希特勒匪帮早已消灭，但是，苏联和伏尔加河、顿河日益繁荣着！
