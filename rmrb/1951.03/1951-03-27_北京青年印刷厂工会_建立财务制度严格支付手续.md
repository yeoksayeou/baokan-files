    Beijing Youth Printing Factory Union
    Establishes Financial System, Strict Payment Procedures

To the Editor:

    The "Reader's Letters" page in your newspaper on February 21 criticized the Beijing Youth Printing Factory Union for its unsound financial system, which led to corruption. Except for minor discrepancies in individual details, the letter accurately reflected the facts. After this incident occurred in November last year, we immediately took action and now report the results as follows: (1) The former chairman of our factory's union was afraid of taking responsibility and procrastinated on his work. The union never established a formal work system or financial system. The monthly union dues were not reported to the committee or the members, but were collected and kept by the organization committee member (who also served as accountant and cashier). The labor insurance funds and union funds paid by the administration were only recorded in the accounts by the union accountant and kept by the administrative accounting department, to be withdrawn as needed. The withdrawal procedures were extremely lax. Sometimes the union chairman would sign and stamp, and sometimes the accountant would directly stamp the union seal to withdraw funds for reimbursement. The union seal was initially kept by the union chairman, but was later kept by the union accountant. Although the chairman and the accountant did not engage in corruption, this was ultimately a loophole. (2) Min Cunpu, the cultural and educational committee member, did not pay enough attention to public finances. Coupled with his extravagant lifestyle, he did not reimburse expenses after buying things with cultural and educational funds, even though the chairman had approved them, and instead spent the remaining funds privately. According to statistics, he owed the administration more than 4.1 million yuan in private use and overdraft of public funds. At the union congress held in December last year, it was decided to suspend his membership; in addition to administrative sanctions, the arrears were recovered; and the Communist Youth League also gave him the punishment of "suspending League membership for six months." (3) Since December 1949, our factory has allocated 3% of the total monthly wages as labor insurance funds, but the union has consistently mishandled this. In the spring of last year, more than 3.22 million yuan was lent to the workers (except for two people who have not yet returned the funds, the rest have been recovered). In November of last year, another 1.22 million yuan was spent on buying waist drums.

    The new committee has determined that the accountant and cashier will be assigned separate responsibilities, and withdrawals must be approved by the chairman and vice-chairman; the use of funds exceeding 100,000 yuan must be approved by the union committee. This will ensure that the same mistakes will not happen again in the future.

### 北京青年印刷厂工会  建立财务制度严格支付手续

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    北京青年印刷厂工会   
    建立财务制度严格支付手续编辑同志：
    贵报二月二十一日，“读者来信专页”批评了北京青年印刷厂工会财务制度不健全，以致发生贪污现象。信中除个别情节有出入外，所谈均属事实。我们在去年十一月发生这事以后，即进行了处理，现将结果报告如下：（一）我厂前工会主任怕负责任，对于工作推诿拖拉，工会始终没建立正规的工作制度和财务制度。每月工会会费收入情况，没有向委员会和会员作过报告，仅由组织委员（兼管会计出纳）收集保管；行政支付的劳动保险基金和工会经费等仅由工会会计登记账目，交行政会计科代为保管，随用随领。领款手续极不周密，有时通过工会主任签字盖章，有时就直接由会计盖工会会章自行领款报销。会章最初由工会主任保管，后即由工会会计保管。虽然主任和会计并未发生贪污情事，但这究竟是一个漏洞。（二）文教委员闵存璞对公共财务重视不够，加上生活浪费，在领用文教费时虽经主任同意，但买了东西以后就没报销，而把余款私自花掉。据统计：连他个人私用及透支公款共亏欠行政四十一万余元。在去年十二月召开的工会大会上，已决定停止他的会籍；行政上除给以处分外，并追还欠款；团内也给以“停止团籍半年”的处分。（三）本厂自一九四九年十二月起，每月由行政拨付工资总额百分之三作劳动保险基金，但工会对此始终处理不当。在去年春季先后借给工友三百二十二万余元（除两人尚未归还，余已收回。），在去年十一月又花了一百二十二万元买了腰鼓。
    新的委员会已确定会计和出纳分工负责，领款必须由主任、副主任批准；动用十万元以上款项时，必须经工会委员会通过。这样今后可以保证不会再有同样错误发生。
