Central Post and Telecommunications Ministry, Postal Administration General Bureau
    Inspection of Township Newspaper Distribution Work in Yutian County, Hebei Province

    Editor:
    After seeing the letter from Comrade Wei Guojun in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 27 regarding his opinions on the newspaper distribution work of the Yutian County Post Office, we immediately conducted an inspection. We are now informing you of the inspection results:

    The newspapers and letters in Donggaoqiao Village, Third District, Yutian County, were directly delivered by the Yutian County Post Office. The township postman traveled two routes every other day to deliver letters and newspapers. Comrade Wei Guojun subscribed to the newspaper at the Yahongqiao Postal Agency. The agent did not know that the newspaper could be delivered directly by the township postman, so he asked Comrade Wei Guojun to pick it up himself. Later, Wei Guojun saw that the Hebei Daily was delivered by the township postman and asked the agency to have it delivered by the township postman. After the agent discussed it with the township postman, the township postman did not deliver the newspaper on the same day because he would no longer pass through Donggaoqiao Village that day, and he would have to take another route the next day, fearing that the newspaper would accumulate in his hands. The agent thought that the township postman would not deliver the People's Daily, so he told Wei Guojun. Therefore, Wei Guojun wrote to the People's Daily to express his opinions.

    There was one time when Wei Guojun could not get the newspaper. This was because the teachers from various villages in the county were holding a meeting at Dawangzhuang School. The township postman, Li Guixin, was entrusted by the agency to hand over Wei Guojun's newspaper to the village teacher to take back. Wei Guojun still went to the agency to pick it up, so he could not get the newspaper. The reason for the missing newspaper was that the agency lent it to others to read, and it has now been returned to Wei Guojun.

    The Yutian County Post Office has now apologized to Comrade Wei Guojun in person and changed the newspaper delivery to be done by the township postman. The Tianjin Postal Administration Bureau has also notified the postal offices in its subordinate counties to strengthen the education of township postmen and conduct regular inspections.

### 中央邮电部邮政总局  对河北省玉田县乡邮报纸发行工作的检查

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　中央邮电部邮政总局
    对河北省玉田县乡邮报纸发行工作的检查   编辑同志：
    看到一月二十七日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登的魏国君同志对玉田县邮局发行报纸工作的意见后，我们即进行了检查。现将检查结果告诉你们：
    玉田县第三区东高桥村的报纸信件，系由玉田县邮局直接递送，由乡邮员隔日跑行两线，投递信件报纸。魏国君同志的报纸是在雅鸿桥邮政代办所订的。代办人不知报纸可由乡邮员直接送，就请魏国君亲自去取。后来魏国君看到河北日报是由乡邮员投递，就向代办所要求改由乡邮员投递。经代办人与乡邮员商量，因当日乡邮员去时不再经过东高桥村，而次日又要走另一条路线，恐怕报纸在他手中积压，就没代投当天的报纸。代办人以为乡邮员不投人民日报，就转告魏国君。因此魏国君就写信给人民日报，提出意见。
    魏国君有一次取不到报。这因为当时该县各村教员在达王庄学校开会，乡邮员李桂馨受代办所之托，把魏国君的报交给该村教员带回去。魏国君仍到代办所去取，因此取不着报。少报的原因则是代办所出借给旁人看，现已要回交魏国君。
    玉田县邮局现已向魏国君同志当面道歉，将报纸改由乡邮员投送。天津邮管局并通知所属各县邮局对乡邮员加强教育，随时检查。
