    Workers at Shandong Electrical Factory
    Urgently Request Reasonable Wage Adjustments

    Editor,
    Many problems urgently need solving at the Shandong Electrical Factory of the East China Industrial Department: (1) The wages of Shandong Electrical Factory employees were assessed in January 1949. At that time, because the conditions for wage assessment were not sound, the assessments were not entirely reasonable. Therefore, the East China Industrial and Mining Department instructed that the wages of apprentices should be assessed every three months, and the wages of workers should be assessed every six months. However, more than two years have passed, and only the apprentices had their wages adjusted once in April and May 1949. Since then, there have been no further wage assessments. As a result, the unreasonable aspects of the wage system have not been resolved in a timely manner, and employees have many complaints about this. In 1950, the Shandong Office of the East China Industrial Department repeatedly instructed the electrical factory to adjust wages, but shortly after the instructions were issued, it was instructed not to adjust them. This happened several times, causing widespread dissatisfaction among employees. (2) The Shandong Provincial People's Government stipulated in the "Provisional Measures for Hiring Temporary Workers" that temporary workers should be converted to formal workers if they have worked continuously for six months. The responsibilities, wages, and working hours of temporary workers should, in principle, be the same as those of equivalent workers. However, the Shandong Electrical Factory does not follow this regulation when hiring temporary workers. Many temporary workers who have worked for more than six months have not yet been converted to formal workers. The wages of temporary workers are also particularly low, at four jin of coarse grain per day. Some workers reported, "Even employing child labor would provide more than four jin of grain, which isn't even enough to eat." Workers have raised these issues several times, but they have not been resolved. (3) The factory suffers from a serious lack of unity among the Party, government, and labor union, with frequent mutual complaints and grievances. The factory management committee, employee representative meetings, etc., are merely formalities, rarely convening, and democratic management is fundamentally absent.

    Editor's Note: The requests made by reader Yin Qingzhang on behalf of the electrical factory workers are reasonable. It is hoped that the relevant leading authorities will provide appropriate solutions.

　　Same Work, Double the Difference in Pay
    Xuzhou Post Office Should Reasonably Adjust Wages

    Editor,
    We are staff members of the Xuzhou Post Office. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, we were temporary workers, and our wage income was insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living, while our work was the same as that of formal employees. Since liberation, we have been employed by the People's Government's post office. Although most of us have six or seven years of work history and experience, our current wages are still pitifully low, less than half of the wages of the original formal employees. Taking the Xuzhou Post Office as an example, people in the same job position receive wages of 140 or 150 points, while we only receive 48 points, a difference of nearly two times. Last year, the labor union proposed adjusting the wages of low-paid personnel, but it has been half a year now, and no adjustments have been seen. We hope that relevant departments can handle this matter in a timely manner.

　　A Factory in Taiyuan
    Why Are Wages Not Paid According to Grain Prices?

    Editor,
    We are all construction workers from Wutai, Shanxi, working at a factory outside the West Gate of Taiyuan City. The Labor Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government issued a circular on February 5th to protect the lives of our workers, instructing all public and private enterprises in the province and city to pay wages according to the government's stipulated grain price for wages. The factory we work for is a state-owned factory, but it has been slow to implement the government's decree. For example, in February, the government's stipulated grain price for wages was 950 yuan per jin of millet, but the factory still paid wages based on 780 yuan per jin of millet. We have repeatedly raised our concerns, but the person in charge of the factory's construction department has repeatedly evaded the issue, saying "no notice has been received," and has consistently failed to implement the government's decree. However, when we go to the factory canteen to buy meal tickets, the factory canteen charges us 950 yuan per jin of millet. Is this method of collecting at a high price and paying wages at a low price not exploiting us workers?

    The factory also illegally contracted out some of the work to foreman Li Fuyou. Later, Li Fuyou absconded with more than 1.4 million yuan, and the workers who did the work could not get their wages. When they asked the factory for their wages, the factory didn't take it seriously. Now we can't get our wages, and we don't have any work to do. We don't have money to pay for our lodging, so even though the weather is still very cold, we have to pawn our quilts and blankets. On March 14th and 15th, we even went hungry. On the evening of the 15th, we had no choice but to find our home – the construction workers' union. The comrades of the union immediately pooled 85,000 yuan to help us temporarily overcome our difficulties and comforted us, for which we are very grateful.

    Why do we suffer the pain of freezing and hunger after doing the work? The factory is responsible. We demand that the factory quickly pay us the previously underpaid wage grain price and the wages owed to us by contractor Li Fuyou.
                          Wei Kuiyuan, Chen Manchang, Wang Chou and more than thirty others

    Editor's Note: The Taiyuan Municipal Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should pay attention to the correct demands of workers Wei Kuiyuan and others and assist them in quickly obtaining a reasonable solution.

　　Longer Coal-Carrying Distance, Lower Wages
    Datong Zhangjiafen Mine Should Pay Attention to Workers' Suggestions

    Editor,
    The wage-grain standard set by the Zhangjiafen Mine, which belongs to the Wanjinwan area of the Datong Mining Area, for coal-carrying workers is unreasonable. After the Zhangjiafen Mine was newly opened last August, we carried coal from the coal area (the place where coal is extracted) to the coal storage yard, a distance of 550 single steps, plus 54 ladder steps. At that time, carrying one load of coal (120 old catties) earned 1 jin and 2 liang of wage-grain. Starting last winter, many nearby farmers participated in coal-carrying production during the slack winter season, and the mine immediately proposed to reduce wages, from 1 jin and 2 liang to 1 jin of wage-grain. However, the coal-carrying distance is much longer: from the second coal area to the coal storage yard is 730 single steps, from the inner coal area to the coal storage yard is 825 steps, and from the fourth coal area to the coal storage yard is 806 steps, plus 54 ladder steps in each case. Based on our personal experience, in the past, the average worker's physical strength and actively working non-stop for eight hours could earn more than 12 jin of grain per day; but now? Generally, we can only earn more than 9 jin of grain. For this reason, we asked the mine manager to increase our wages. The mine manager's reply was "We'll talk about it later."

    I believe that mines are state-owned enterprises and should pay attention to the interests of workers. It is inappropriate for the mine to treat laborers in this way.

　　山东电器厂工人
    迫切要求合理调整工资编辑同志：
    华东工业部山东电器厂目前还存在着许多问题急待解决：（一）山东电器厂职工的工资是一九四九年一月份评的。当时因为评工资的条件不健全，评的并不完全合理，因此华东工矿部指示：今后学工的工资应该三个月评一次，工人半年评一次。但至今已两年多，只学工在一九四九年四、五月间调整一次工资，以后就再也没有评过工资。以致工资制度中的不合理现象未得及时解决，职工对此意见很多。一九五○年华东工业部山东办事处曾几次指示电器厂应调整工资，但指示下达后不久，又指示不要调整。这样反复数次，引起职工普遍的不满。（二）山东省人民政府在“雇用临时工试行办法”中的规定：临时工受雇期限如果连续工作满六个月后，得改为正式工。临时工之职责、工资、工时等原则上应与同等工人同等待遇。山东电器厂在雇用临时工时，却不照此规定执行。很多工作满六个月的临时工，现在还没有转为正式工人。临时工的工资也特别低，每天四斤粗粮。有的工人反映：“雇童工也不只四斤粮，连吃的都不够。”这些情况工人已提了几次意见，一直没有解决。（三）该厂党、政、工不团结现象很严重，经常互相瞒怨。工厂管理委员会、职工代表会等都流于形式，经常不开会，根本谈不到民主管理。
                                         读者  殷清章
    编者按：读者殷清章代表电器厂工人所提出的要求是合理的，希有关领导机关予以适当解决。
　　工作相同待遇相差两倍
    徐州邮局应合理调整工资编辑同志：
    我们是徐州邮局工作人员。在敌伪统治时期是临时工，那时我们的工资收入不足维持最低生活，而工作是和正式员工一样。自解放后，我们被人民政府的邮局录用，虽然我们多数都有六、七年的工作历史及工作经验，而现在的工资还是低得可怜，不及旧有的正式员工的工资的一半。就拿徐州邮局来说：同一工作岗位的人有的拿一百四五十工资分，而我们只拿四十八分，相差将近两倍之多。去年工会曾提出调整低薪人员的工资，但至现在已有半年之久，并未见调整。我们希望有关部门能及时处理这件事。

　　太原某工厂
    为何不按工资米价发工资编辑同志：
    我们都是山西五台的建筑工人，到太原市西门外某工厂做活。山西省人民政府劳动局为了保障咱工人的生活，曾于二月五日发出通令，指示本省市各公私营企业一律按政府工薪米价发给工资。我们干活的厂是公营工厂，却迟迟不执行政府法令，如二月份政府工薪米价小米每斤为九百五十元，该厂仍按每斤小米七百八十元发工资。我们屡次提意见，可是该厂建设科负责人却一再推脱说“没有接到通知”，始终不执行政府法令。但我们到工厂食堂买米票吃饭时，工厂的食堂却按每斤小米九百五十元收我们的饭费。这种大价收款小价发薪的办法，不是剥削我们工人是什么？
    该厂又将一部分活非法包给工头李富有，后来李富有携款一百四十余万潜逃无踪，工人做了工拿不到工资，向厂里要，厂里不当一回事。现在我们拿不上工钱，又没活干，没有钱还住店费，虽然天气还很冷，也只好把被子、毯子押给人家。在三月十四、五两日我们还挨了饿。在十五日晚上，我们万般无奈地找到了自己的家——建筑工会。工会的同志当即凑了八万五千元，帮助我们暂时克服困难，并且安慰我们，使我们非常感激。
    为什么我们干了活，却遭受挨冻挨饿的痛苦呢？某工厂是应该负责任的。我们要求该厂迅速发给我们以前少发的工资米价和包工头李富有拖欠我们的工资。
                          魏魁元、陈满昌、王丑等三十余人
    编者按：太原市劳动局及市总工会应该重视工人魏魁元等的正确要求，协助他们迅速求得合理解决。
　　背煤的路程远了工资反而低
    大同张家坟矿井应注意工人建议编辑同志：
    大同矿区挖金湾所属张家坟矿井，对背煤工人的工资米订的不合理。去年八月新开张家坟矿井后，当时我们背煤是从煤区（取煤的地方）背至堆煤场，计五百五十单步，还有五十四蹬梯子，当时背一遭煤（一百二十斤老秤）一斤二两工资米。由去冬开始，附近许多农民利用冬闲季节，参加背煤生产，矿方即提出减低工资，工资米由一斤二两减为一斤。可是背煤的路程却远的多了：由第二煤区至堆煤场为七百三十单步，由里煤区至堆煤场为八百二十五步，由第四煤区至堆煤场为八百零六步，此外各有五十四蹬梯子。根据我们的亲身体验，在以往，一般工人的体力与积极不停留地工作八小时，每人每日可挣十二斤多米；可是现在呢？一般的只能挣九斤多米。为此，我们向该井经理要求增加工资。该井经理的答复是“以后再说吧。”
    我认为：矿山系国营企业，应当注意工人利益，该井这样对待劳动者是不恰当的。
