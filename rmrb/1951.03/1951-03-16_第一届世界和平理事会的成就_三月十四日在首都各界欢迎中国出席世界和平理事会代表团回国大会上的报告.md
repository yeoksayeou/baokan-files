　　Achievements of the First World Peace Council
    ——Report at the Rally of People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Welcoming the Return of the Chinese Delegation to the World Peace Council on March 14
       Guo Moruo
        (I)
    The World Peace Council, only three months after its establishment by the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw last November, convened its first session in Berlin in response to the urgent needs of the world's people. Participants included 110 council members from 54 countries and 124 special invitees.
    The Council originally consisted of 222 members from 60 countries. The number of council members varied from country to country, with some having as many as 27, like France, and others only one. After the Warsaw Congress, some council members from remote countries were still en route home, so not all member states were present. However, new countries such as Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines sent representatives to this session, which is particularly gratifying.
    The session opened on February 21st. After six days of harmonious and enthusiastic discussions, ten important resolutions were reached: First, to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact; Second, to condemn the United Nations' degenerate crimes and demand that the United Nations resume its peace mission as stipulated in the UN Charter; Third, to oppose the arming of West Germany and advocate a peaceful resolution of the German question; Fourth, to oppose the arming of Japan and advocate a peaceful resolution of the Japanese question; Fifth, to demand that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and allow the Korean people to resolve their internal affairs themselves; Sixth, to demand that the United Nations rescind its resolution smearing the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor"; Seventh, to encourage the liberation movements of colonial peoples; Eighth, to enrich the work of the magazine "Peace"; Ninth, to promote the work of the International Peace Prize and reorganize the Peace Prize Committee; Tenth, to prepare to convene six major regional people's conferences and a series of international conferences for economic and cultural workers within the year to expand the peace movement. The session provided concrete solutions to the issues of greatest concern to the world's people, taking the Warsaw Congress's peace program a step further. In addition, 38 council members were newly elected, and five new member states were added, further expanding the foundation of the world's movement to defend peace. In this way, the session completed its mission and closed victoriously on the 26th.
  (II)
    This session was convened amidst an international situation in which the struggle between aggressive forces and peaceful forces has become more acute.
    The aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism, since launching the war of aggression against Korea last June, has refused to learn its lesson despite suffering heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people. Instead, it has more blatantly revealed its intention to expand the war of aggression. The US government, in particular, is endlessly increasing its military budget and simultaneously preparing to launch a new world war from both East and West. In the West, it sent Eisenhower to Europe to prepare to arm West Germany and organize an Allied force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of over one million men. In the East, it sent Dulles to Tokyo, Japan, attempting to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and further arm Japan. The warmongers are thus unscrupulously tearing up all international conventions, violating the will of the people of the world, and planning to regroup the remnants of the criminals who started World War II to launch another world war in order to satisfy their ambition to obtain excess profits and enslave all mankind.
    However, in order to facilitate the collection of large amounts of military spending and cannon fodder, the warmongers are adept at distorting the truth and confusing right and wrong to deceive the masses. They often tell outrageous lies, smearing other countries as "aggressors" while using flowery words to whitewash their own acts of aggression as legitimate self-defense. The Soviet Union, which has consistently adhered to a policy of peace, has been smeared by them as an aggressive country. All movements for democratic reform or freedom and liberation within countries, even strikes or gatherings forced upon the working people within capitalist countries for economic demands, have been distorted as "acts of aggression." Most recently, and with the utmost shamelessness, the United Nations, manipulated by the US government, even passed a shameful resolution smearing our People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in Korea. The deployment of these deceptive tricks is the so-called spiritual mobilization of the warmongers, and it is precisely an active action in their preparation for a war of aggression.
    A small stream not stopped will become a great river. In order to save the world from a crisis of peace, the World Peace Council could not sit idly by, so it quickly convened this session, addressing the various issues of greatest concern to the world's people, and, based on the will of the world's people, considering various concrete plans to advance the cause of defending world peace. This session was indeed a timely and historically significant meeting.
  (III)
    One thing we must particularly remind ourselves of here is that six days before the opening of this session of the Council, on February 16th, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published an interview with Comrade Stalin by a Pravda correspondent on the current international situation. This interview was like the sun shining through the heavy overcast mist, giving unspeakable comfort and encouragement to all peace-loving people around the world. Comrade Stalin said:
    "Peace can be preserved and consolidated if the people take the cause of maintaining peace into their own hands and defend this cause to the end. War may become inevitable if the warmongers succeed in ensnaring the masses in a web of lies, deceive the masses and drag them into another world war.
    That is why the broad movement for maintaining peace, as a means of exposing the criminal machinations of the warmongers, is now of paramount importance."
    These words in particular were an unspeakable encouragement to this session of the Council. They provided a very clear direction for the cause of defending peace: to defend peace, we must expose the deceptive propaganda of the warmongers and develop a broad foundation for the peace movement. These two directions have been the principles followed by all peace comrades since the Paris-Prague Congress of 1949, but after this reminder from Comrade Stalin, they are expressed even more clearly in the various decisions of this session of the Council.
    Let us select one or two of the ten important decisions for review!
  (IV)
    First is the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact.
    The Peace Council, "in order to implement the hopes cherished by hundreds of millions of people around the world - regardless of their views on the causes of the danger of world war - and in order to consolidate peace and ensure international security, we demand that the five major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom and France - conclude a peace pact. We will consider that the refusal by the government of any one of the five major powers to hold a meeting to conclude such a pact proves that the government of that country has aggressive intentions." The Council calls on the people of the world to support this demand and hold a signature campaign.
    This is a concise and powerful declaration. Its purpose is to mobilize the people of the world to unite and demand peace. If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France continue to reject the demands of hundreds of millions of people around the world, it will prove in the clearest possible way that they are aggressors who reject peace.
    The conclusion of a peace pact is absolutely no problem for our People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our Chinese people have been wholeheartedly engaged in peaceful construction since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The US imperialists have constantly obstructed us, occupying our Taiwan, invading our neighbor Korea, and endangering the security of our motherland. Only then were we Chinese people forced to defend ourselves and launch the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. Our just movement is for the sake of defending peace in Asia and the world. Our demand for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue remains unchanged, so we undoubtedly fully support the conclusion of a peace pact.
    The Soviet Union has always been a country that adheres to a policy of peace. The Soviet government has twice proposed the suggestion that the five major powers conclude a peace pact at United Nations meetings. We can firmly believe that the Soviet government will never refuse this request from the Council.
    Then the problem is left with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. It is these three governments that have extremely shamelessly smeared our China and the Soviet Union as "aggressors." Well then, please come and conclude a peace pact, and see if you refuse! Therefore, the declaration of a peace pact is in fact a touchstone, and it can simply and directly test a truth in front of the people of the world - who is the aggressor after all? Is it China and the Soviet Union? Or is it the United States, Britain, and France?
  (V)
    Secondly, is the resolution on the United Nations.
    The Council condemns the United Nations for failing to respond to the Warsaw Congress's letter to the United Nations, which is a contempt for the peace demands of the world's people. The United Nations continues to fail the expectations of the world's people, reaching its peak by smearing the Chinese people as "aggressors." The United Nations is covering up American aggression, conducting deliberate destruction in Korea, and causing millions of Korean people, the old, the weak, women, and children, to be burned and killed in the ashes of countless villages and cities.
    The Council has therefore organized a thirteen-member delegation to go to the United Nations to ask it to express its views on each of the peace proposals of the Warsaw Congress and this session of the Council, and to return to the functions stipulated in the United Nations Charter and become a place for consultation among the world's people rather than a tool of manipulative groups.
    This is a punitive expedition to the United Nations. If the United Nations still ignores this request from the World Peace Council, it will more clearly prove that it has become a tool for imperialism to carry out aggression and war. Although the United Nations "is heading down the inglorious road of the League of Nations," it is still a flag in the hands of the US imperialists to cover up aggression. In order to expose the criminal attempts of the warmongers, it is still worthwhile for us to further expose the ugly truth of this flag today. The peace program of the Warsaw Congress, you the United Nations ignored. Today we are sending a peace delegation to discuss it with you again, see if you will pay attention or not? If you ignore it again, then what exactly is this United Nations that "seeks international peace and security for the people of the world"?
    Therefore, this decision on the United Nations is also a touchstone - a touchstone for the United Nations.
  (VI)
    The various decisions, in this way, are all formulated under the two correct directions of exposing the criminal schemes of the warmongers and developing a broad foundation for the peace movement. In particular, in the "Decision on Organizing and Expanding the Peace Movement," these two directions are written very clearly and specifically. The original proposal is available, so we do not need to list them one by one here.
    In short, objectively speaking, this session of the Peace Council does indeed have its brilliant achievements. The various decisions are in line with the demands of the people of the world, especially the demands of our Chinese people. All five of our suggestions to the Council were adopted. We demanded:
    "(1) The Peace Council should condemn the United Nations General Assembly for smearing the People's Republic of China as an aggressor and demand the immediate cancellation of this shameful decision and the acceptance of the peaceful proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the Korean and Far Eastern issues.
    (2) The Peace Council recommends to the governments of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the above four countries to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, eliminate German militarism, eliminate differences of opinion on the German issue, and seek to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible.
    (3) The Peace Council recommends to the governments of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to convene a certain meeting to discuss the Japanese issue and conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible based on the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement.
    (4) Call on the people of the world, mothers, wounded soldiers of the Second World War, and the families of the dead to take all possible means to oppose the American arming of Germany and Japan and refuse to participate in any actions to arm Germany and Japan.
    (5) The Council should initiate and help convene mass representative meetings of the people of the countries concerned in Europe and Asia respectively to launch a movement against the American arming of Germany and Japan."
    These suggestions are completely contained in the various decisions of the Council. And in some concrete steps, the Council's decisions are a step further than our suggestions.
    For example, in the "Resolution on Organizational Issues and Expanding the Peace Movement," the Peace Council advocates that "a meeting of the people of the European signatory states to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be convened in Paris or Brussels in the shortest possible time by the Franco-Belgian Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany, and the German people should be invited to participate. The purpose of the meeting is to study the struggle against the remilitarization of Germany and the peaceful settlement of the German question."
    This is because such a meeting is brewing in Western Europe and a plebiscite is being prepared, and it may be held in the near future. This proposal of the Council is based on existing and urgent facts. Regarding the East, the Council also "adopts the proposal to organize a conference of Asian and Pacific countries, the main purpose of which is to discuss the struggle against the rearmament of Japan and the peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict; at the same time, it discusses the issue of holding a plebiscite in the relevant countries in Asia and the Pacific on the re-militarization of Japan and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan this year."
  (VII)
    The first session of the World Peace Council ended victoriously amidst the warm expectations of peace-loving friends around the world. Its achievements are important and rich, and the sound of fervent support is spreading throughout the world. This conference proved that the World Peace Council has not failed the expectations of the people of the world, and it can indeed "shoulder this noble task and guarantee a stable and lasting peace that is in the vital interests of all countries."
    Here there is a contrast between those being born and those about to die. On one side is the United Nations, "heading down the inglorious road of the League of Nations. In this way, it is burying its moral authority and is doomed to disintegration"; and on the other side is the World Peace Council, which is bravely calling on "the people of all countries to take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end."
    The conference ended victoriously, but all the various decisions must be put into practice by the peace-loving people of the world.
    All of the various decisions contain more or less general directional instructions. When implementing the resolutions, the people of all countries must, of course, consider and decide on appropriate steps according to the specific circumstances of each country and various subjective and objective conditions.
    We Chinese people, in the movement to defend peace, can certainly be said to be at the forefront. Our patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country is the foremost front line of the movement to defend world peace.
    To defend world peace, we must oppose American aggression. To oppose American aggression, we must also have the actual strength to defeat all the aggressive institutions that the aggressors have already put into place, whether they are military, espionage, or cultural institutions. On this point, we Chinese people are using great strength to resist the aggressors. The heavy blows given to the aggressors by our People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are a great contribution to the movement to defend world peace. Since the aggressors are unwilling to learn their lesson and are instead smearing us as "aggressors" as an excuse to expand the war of aggression, our movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country must be further deepened, further expanded, and more persistent, in order to liberate the entire Korea and eliminate the threat to peace in the Far East and peace in the world.
    We must warmly support and practice the various decisions of the first session of the World Peace Council. We must respond to the call of the World Peace Council, launch a signature campaign for the declaration of a peace pact, and hold a plebiscite on the Japanese issue in an appropriate manner. In advancing the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, we must also strive to expose the warmongers' evil propaganda and expand the foundation of the movement to defend peace. Every reduction in the cannon fodder material of the aggressive camp is an increase in the living strength of the peace camp. Constantly consolidating ourselves and disintegrating the enemy can not only win the existing Korean War, but also eliminate future world wars.
    Long live the victory of the peace camp!

　　第一届世界和平理事会的成就
    ——三月十四日在首都各界欢迎中国出席世界和平理事会代表团回国大会上的报告
       郭沫若
        （一）
    世界和平理事会，自去年十一月，由华沙二届和平大会产生以来仅仅三个月，应着世界人民迫切的需要，在柏林召开了第一届会议。有五十四个国家，一百一十名理事，一百二十四名特邀代表参加。
    理事会的理事国本来是六十国，理事二百二十二人。理事的人数，各国多寡不等，多的如法国有二十七名，少的便只有一名。华沙大会后，有些来自偏远国家的理事还在归国的途中，故理事国未能到齐。但在本届会议中有新参加的国家，如日本、泰国、菲律宾都派遣了代表出席，是值得特别庆贺的。
    会议在二月二十一日开幕，经过了和谐热烈的六天讨论之后，得到了十项的重要决定——第一、要求五大强缔结和平公约；第二、谴责联合国的堕落罪行，要求联合国恢复执行联合国宪章所规定的和平任务；第三、反对武装西德，主张和平解决德国问题；第四、反对武装日本，主张和平解决日本问题；第五、要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自行解决朝鲜内政；第六、要求联合国取消诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的决议；第七、鼓励殖民地人民的解放运动；第八、充实《和平》杂志的工作；第九、促进国际和平奖金的工作并改组和平奖金委员会；第十、在年内分别准备召开六大区域的人民会议和一系列的经济文化工作者的国际会议，以扩大和平运动。会议对于世界人民所最关切的问题，都作出具体的解决方案，把华沙大会的和平纲领更向前推进了一步；此外，还补选了理事三十八名，新添了五个理事国，也更把世界保卫和平运动的基础扩大了一步。就这样，会议完成了它的任务，在二十六日胜利地闭幕了。
  （二）
    本届会议是在侵略势力与和平力量的斗争更加尖锐化的国际形势之下召开的。
    以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，自从去年六月发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，尽管遭受到中朝人民的沉重打击，但他们不肯接受教训，反而更加赤裸裸地表明了存心扩大侵略战争的企图。特别是美国政府，它正在无止境地增加军事预算，并从东西两方同时进行发动新的世界战争的准备。在西方它派遣了艾森豪威尔到欧洲，准备武装西德并组织一百万人以上的北大西洋公约国的联军。在东方它又派遣了杜勒斯到过日本东京，企图与日本片面媾和，更进一步地武装日本。战争贩子们，就这样肆无忌惮地撕毁一切国际公约，违背全世界人民的意志，打算把卷起二次大战的罪恶分子的残余纠合起来，重新卷起一次世界大战，以满足他们获得超额利润、奴役全人类的野心。
    但为了便于集合大量的军费和炮灰，战争贩子们却惯会颠倒黑白，淆乱是非，来欺骗人民大众。它们经常扯下弥天大谎，把别的国家诬蔑为“侵略者”，而用花言巧语把自己的侵略行为粉饰成正当防卫。一贯地坚持和平政策的苏联便被它们诬蔑为具有侵略性的国家。一切国家内部争取民主改革或自由解放的运动，甚至如资本主义国家内部的劳动人民为经济要求而被迫发动的罢工或集会，也都被歪曲为“侵略”行为。最近更无耻到万分地，在美国政府操纵之下的联合国，竟通过了诬蔑我们中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的可耻决定。这些欺骗伎俩的发挥就是战争贩子们的所谓精神动员，也正是它们在准备侵略战争中的一项积极行动。
    涓涓不塞，将为江河。为了挽救世界和平的危机，世界和平理事会不能坐视，故迅速召开了本届会议，针对着世界人民所最关切的各项问题，并依据世界人民的意志，考虑出了各种具体方案，来推进世界和平的保卫事业。本届会议确实是一个适时的具有历史意义的会议。
  （三）
    在这里有须得我们特别提醒的一件事，便是在本届理事会开会之前六天，二月十六日，苏联真理报发表了斯大林大元帅对真理报记者关于目前国际形势的谈话。这一番谈话真像照破了重阴迷雾的太阳光，给予了全世界爱好和平的人民以无可言喻的安慰和鼓励。斯大林大元帅说：
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界战争之中，那末，战争就可能变得不可避免。
    就是因为这个缘故，广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，在现在具有最重大的意义。”
    特别是这几句话对于本届理事会的鼓励，更是不可言喻的。这为保卫和平事业给予了十分明确的方针，便是：要保卫和平，必须揭露战争贩子的欺骗宣传并开拓和平运动的广泛基础。这两个方针本来是自一九四九年巴黎——布拉格大会以来，一切和平战友们所遵守着的原则，但经过斯大林大元帅的这一番点醒，在本届理事会的各项决定中是表现得更为明确了。
    请让我们从那十项重要决定中选出一二项来加以检讨吧！
  （四）
    首先是关于缔结和平公约的宣言。
    和平理事会“为了实施全世界亿万人民——不论他们对于世界战争危险发生的原因所持的见解如何——所怀抱的希望，为了巩固和平并保障国际安全，我们要求五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国及法国——缔结和平公约。我们将认为不论五大国的任何一国政府拒绝举行会议缔结这种公约，就证明该国政府有侵略的图谋”。理事会号召全世界人民支持这项要求并举行签名运动。
    这是一个简洁而有力的宣言。它的用意，是动员全世界人民一致起而要求和平。美英法三国政府如果继续拒绝全世界亿万人民的要求，就会最明白不过地证明他们是拒绝和平的侵略者。
    和平公约的缔结在我们中华人民共和国和苏联是绝对不成问题的。我们中国人民，在毛主席的英明领导之下，自建立中华人民共和国以来，即以全心全意从事和平建设。美帝国主义者不断地阻挠我们，侵占我们的台湾，侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，危害到我们祖国的安全。我们中国人民才被迫自卫，发动了抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动。我们的这一正义运动就是为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平。我们对于和平解决朝鲜问题的要求始终不变，因而我们对于和平公约的缔结毫无疑问是要全面拥护的。
    苏联向来是坚持和平政策的国家。苏联政府在联合国会议上曾经前后两次提出过五大强缔结和平公约的建议。我们可以坚决地相信，对于理事会这一次的要求，苏联政府也是绝不会拒绝的。
    那吗问题就剩下美国、英国、法国的政府了。正是这三国的政府极端无耻地诬蔑我们中国和苏联为“侵略者”。那吗好，就请你们来缔结和平公约吧，看你们拒绝不拒绝！因此，和平公约的宣言事实上是一个试金石，它在全世界人民的面前可以简捷了当地考验出来一个真实——究竟谁是侵略者？是中苏？还是美英法？
  （五）
    其次是关于联合国的决议。
    理事会谴责联合国对于华沙大会致联合国书不置答复，这是蔑视世界人民的和平要求。联合国仍然辜负着世界人民的期望，以诬蔑中国人民为“侵略者”而达到最高峰。联合国掩饰着美国的侵略，在朝鲜进行着居心的破坏，使百万朝鲜人民老弱妇孺被烧杀在无数乡村城市的灰烬之中。
    理事会因而组织了一个十三人代表团要到联合国去，要它对华沙大会和本届理事会的各项和平建议逐项表示意见，要它回复到联合国宪章所规定的职分，成为世界人民协商的场所而不是操纵集团的工具。
    这是向联合国兴问罪之师。联合国如果对世界和平理事会这个要求仍然置之不理，就会更加明显地证明它成了帝国主义进行侵略和战争的工具。联合国尽管“正在走上国际联盟的不光荣的道路”，它依然是美帝国主义者手中的一面掩饰侵略的旗子。为了揭露战争贩子们的罪恶企图，对于这面旗子的丑恶真相，在今天也还值得我们更进一步地来加以暴露。华沙大会的和平纲领，你联合国置之不理。今天我们再派和平代表团来和你商量，看你还理也不理？你假如再置之不理，那吗你在“为世界人民谋国际的和平与安全”的联合国到底是个什么东西？
    因此，这一关于联合国的决定又是一个试金石——对于联合国的试金石。
  （六）
    各项决定，就这样，都是从揭露战争贩子的罪恶阴谋和开拓和平运动的广泛基础这两个正确的方针之下所拟定出来的。特别是在“关于组织与扩大和平运动的决定”里面把这两项方针写得非常显豁而具体，原案具在，我们不必在这儿一一缕述了。
    总之，很客观地说，本届和平理事会确实有它的辉煌的成就。各项决定都符合了全世界人民的要求，尤其我们中国人民的要求。我们中国人民对于理事会的五项建议是全部被采纳了。我们要求：
    “（一）和平理事会对于联合国大会诬蔑中华人民共和国为侵略者加以谴责，并要求立即取消这一可耻的决定，而接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府关于朝鲜及远东问题的和平建议。
    （二）和平理事会向苏联、法国、英国、美国政府建议，召集上述四国外长会议，讨论履行波茨坦协定，肃清德国军国主义，消除在德国问题上的分歧意见，谋求迅速缔结对德和约。
    （三）和平理事会向中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国政府建议，召开一定的会议，讨论日本问题，依据开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔达协议，早日缔结全面的对日和约。
    （四）号召世界人民、母亲们、二次大战伤兵们及死亡者的家属们，采取可能的一切方式，反对美国武装德国和日本，拒绝参与武装德国和日本的一切行动。
    （五）理事会发起和帮助分别召集欧洲和亚洲有关各国人民的群众代表会议，展开反对美国武装德国和日本的运动。”
    这些建议是完全被包含在理事会的各项决定里面的。而在某些具体步骤上，理事会的决定却又比我们的建议更前进了一步。
    例如在“关于组织问题与扩大和平运动的决议”里面，和平理事会主张“在最短的时间内由反对德国重新军国主义化的法比委员会在巴黎或布鲁塞尔召开北大西洋公约欧洲各签约国的人民的会议，并邀请德国人民参加。会议的目的是研究关于反对德国重新军国主义化的斗争以及以和平方式解决德国问题”。
    这是因为在西欧正在酝酿着这样的会议并在筹备着民意投票，而且可能在最近期内便要举行。理事会的这一主张是根据了既存的迫切的事实而提出的。关于东方，理事会也同时“通过组织亚洲和太平洋各国会议的建议，会议的主要目的是讨论反对重新武装日本的斗争以及和平解决刻正进行的冲突的问题；同时讨论在亚洲和太平洋的有关国家就日本重新军国主义化和在今年缔结对日和约的问题举行民意投票的问题”。
  （七）
    第一届世界和平理事会是在全世界和平友人的热烈期待中胜利地结束了，它所得到的成就重要而且丰富，全世界都在传播着热诚拥护的声浪。这一次会议证明了世界和平理事会没有辜负全世界人民的期待，它确能“担负着这个崇高的任务，保障稳固的与持久的和平，符合各国人民的切身利益”。
    这里有着方生与将死的一个对照。一边是联合国，“正在走上国际联盟的不光荣的道路。这样它就埋葬着它的道义的权威，注定了要分崩离析”；而另一边便是世界和平理事会，它正勇敢地号召“各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底”。
    会议是胜利地结束了，但所有的各项决定却须得全世界爱好和平的人民来共同实践。
    所有的各项决定多少是含有一般性的方向指示，各国人民在执行决议时当然要依照各国的具体情况，主观和客观的各种条件，更进一步地考虑和决定适当的步骤。
    我们中国人民在保卫和平运动中，可以肯定地说，是走在最前头的。我们的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动就是保卫世界和平运动的最前进的一线。
    要保卫世界和平，必须反对美国侵略。要反对美国侵略，还必须有实际的力量来击溃侵略者已经进行着的一切侵略机构，不问它是军事机构、间谍机构或文化机构。在这一点上，我们中国人民正在用着大的力量对于侵略者进行反抗。我们的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军所给予侵略者的沉重打击，是在保卫世界和平运动上的一项伟大的贡献。侵略者既不肯接受教训，反而诬蔑我们为“侵略者”以作为扩大侵略战争的借口，我们抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，便还须得更加深入、更加扩大、更加持久、以期解放整个的朝鲜，并解除远东和平与世界和平的威胁。
    我们要热烈地拥护并实践第一届世界和平理事会的各项决定。我们要响应世界和平理事会的号召，展开和平公约宣言的签名运动，并以适当方式举行关于日本问题的民意投票。在推进抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，我们要同时努力揭露战争贩子们的罪恶宣传，扩大保卫和平运动的基础。侵略阵营的炮灰资料减少一分，和平阵营的有生力量便增加一分。不断地巩固自己并瓦解敌人，不仅可以赢得既存的朝鲜战争，而且可以消弭未来的世界大战。
    和平阵营胜利万岁！
