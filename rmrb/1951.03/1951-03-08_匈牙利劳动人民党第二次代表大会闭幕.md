　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 3rd (TASS): The Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, which opened on February 25th, passed a resolution at its closing meeting on March 1st regarding the report of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the report on the achievements of the first year of the Five-Year Plan and the most important tasks in the socialist construction of the national economy.

　　The resolution pointed out that the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party correctly assessed the international situation in the period after the unification congress, and the party struggled in such an international situation to create conditions for socialist construction and to strive for the successful construction of socialism.

　　The resolution stated that the peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union, which is victorious and building communism, powerfully blocked the path of the dark forces of imperialism preparing to launch a new world war.

　　The Soviet Union steadfastly continues to pursue a policy of peace, with a view to reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and concluding international peace pacts. The powerful world movement for peace is exposing the warmongers and preventing the realization of their plans.

　　The congress determined that it was correct for the party's Central Committee to place the Hungarian people in the camp struggling for the cause of peace. The congress agreed with the government's statement against the revival of German imperialism, which especially endangers the Hungarian people, and against the rearmament of West Germany, based on the treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance concluded with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The congress determined that the Central Committee's policy for restoring the Hungarian national economy and starting socialist construction was correct.

　　The resolution then emphasized that the further smooth acceleration of Hungary's industrialization and the completion of the Five-Year Plan require eliminating the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development and greatly increasing the commercialization rate of agricultural production (which can only be achieved through a gradual transition to large-scale agricultural production). The congress determined that the Central Committee's policy for consolidating the alliance between the working class and the working peasants and for consolidating the leading position of the working class in this alliance was correct and successful. The majority of intellectuals have also sided with the people's democracy. The unity of the working people has been strengthened.

　　The resolution stated that the construction of socialism and the increasingly strong rejection of exploiters have sharpened the class struggle in the past and will make the class struggle even sharper in the future. It is manifested in the resistance of the rich peasant class, the sabotage of reactionary elements hidden in state organs, the sabotage of clerical reactionaries, and the activities of speculators to corrupt the ranks.

　　The congress determined that the establishment of a unified workers' party was a correct step. Regardless of the betrayal of individual Social Democratic leaders, former Social Democratic workers and party workers still united with the Communists on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

　　The prestige of the Hungarian Working People's Party has increased. The working people recognize its leading position.

　　After further pointing out the achievements and shortcomings in the party's organizational work, the resolution continued: The congress determined that eliminating the dual nature of the Hungarian national economy and establishing a single socialist foundation for the national economy by means of the socialist transformation of agriculture is the party's current decisive task.

　　The resolution emphasized that it is necessary to accelerate Hungary's industrialization by expanding the Five-Year Plan and to take significant steps to eliminate agricultural backwardness. The resolution instructed that it is necessary to further expand the cultural revolution, consolidate the people's democratic state power, strengthen the struggle for peace, strengthen party organizations, and improve party work in all aspects, especially party work in the countryside.

　　The resolution stated that these major tasks, the sharpening of the class struggle, and the tension of the international situation all require: eliminating the phenomena of lax discipline and liberalism in the ranks of the Hungarian Working People's Party, raising vigilance, implementing the iron discipline of the Communist Party, and carrying out work with the working attitude, exemplary style, and selflessness of a Communist Party member.

　　In conclusion, the resolution pointed out that the congress approved the report of the Central Committee of the party and approved its political line and practical activities in the period after the unification congress.

　　匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会闭幕
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布达佩斯三日电：二月二十五日开幕的匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会，在三月一日的闭幕会议上通过了关于匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的报告和关于五年计划第一年的成就与国民经济的社会主义建设方面最重要任务的报告的一项决议。
    决议指出：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会在统一大会以后的时期中正确地估计了国际形势，党就是在这样的国际形势中为给社会主义建设创造条件和争取社会主义顺利地建设成功而斗争的。
    决议称：以胜利的、正在建设共产主义的伟大的苏联为首的和平阵营强有力地阻挡了准备发动新的世界战争的帝国主义黑暗势力的道路。
    苏联坚持不渝地继续奉行和平政策，以期裁减军备、禁止原子武器、缔结国际和平公约。强大的世界争取和平运动揭露着战争贩子，阻止他们的计划的实现。
    大会确定：党的中央委员会使匈牙利人民处于为和平事业而奋斗的阵营之中是正确的。大会同意政府根据和苏联及人民民主国家缔订的友好合作互助条约，声言反对特别危及匈牙利人民的德国帝国主义的复活，反对西德的重新武装。大会确定：中央委员会为恢复匈牙利国民经济和开始社会主义建设的政策是正确的。
    决议接着着重指出：匈牙利工业化进一步的顺利加速实现，五年计划的完成，都要求消灭工业发展与农业发展之间不平衡的现象，要求大大提高农业生产的商品化率（这只有经由逐渐过渡到大规模农业生产才能达到）。大会确定，中央委员会为巩固工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟以及巩固工人阶级在这一联盟中领导地位的政策，是正确而成功的。大部分知识分子也已经站在人民民主这一边。劳动人民的团结一致是加强了。
    决议称：社会主义的建设、对剥削者的日益加强的排斥行动，过去已经使阶级斗争尖锐起来而且将来还要使阶级斗争更加尖锐：它表现在富农阶级的抵抗，暗藏在国家机关内反动分子的怠工，僧侣反动派的破坏工作，投机分子的使队伍腐化的活动。
    大会确定：建立统一的工人政党是正确的步骤，前社会民主党工人和党务工作人员不管个别社会民主党领导者的叛卖行为，仍在马克思列宁主义的基础上一致和共产党人团结起来了。
    匈牙利劳动人民党的威信增高了。劳动人民都承认其领导地位。
    决议在进而指出党的组织工作上的成绩和缺点后，继称：大会确定：消灭匈牙利国民经济的二重性质，以农业的社会主义改造的方法为国民经济建立的单一的社会主义基础，乃是党当前的决定性的任务。
    决议强调必须以扩大五年计划来加速匈牙利的工业化，必须采取重大步骤消灭农业的落后性。决议指示：必须进一步扩大文化革命，巩固人民民主的国家政权，加强争取和平的斗争，加强党组织和改进各方面的党务工作，首先是乡村中的党务工作。
    决议称：这些重大任务，阶级斗争的尖锐化，国际形势的紧张，都要求：消灭匈牙利劳动人民党队伍中纪律松弛和自由主义的现象，提高警觉性，实施共产党铁的纪律，以共产党员的工作态度，以共产党员的模范作风和忘我精神进行工作。
    决议在结语中指出，大会批准党中央委员会的报告，批准它在统一大会以后的时期中的政治路线和实际活动。
