　　Conscientiously Carry Out the Work of Issuing Land Certificates and Collecting Certificate Fees
    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Filling Out and Issuing Land and Property Ownership Certificates" on November 25th of last year. Now, the Government Administration Council has issued the "Decision on Charging Fees for Land and Property Ownership Certificates." These two measures are major events related to determining land rights and consolidating the fruits of emancipation for the 150 million people in the new land reform areas this year.
    Article 27 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "In areas where land reform has been implemented, the ownership of land already obtained by farmers must be protected." Article 30 of the Land Reform Law stipulates: "After the completion of land reform, the people's government shall issue land ownership certificates and recognize the rights of all land owners to freely operate, buy, sell, and lease their land. Land contracts prior to the land system reform shall be nullified." Determining land rights and issuing land certificates is the final stage in land reform. Doing a good job in this work is of great significance for stabilizing and enhancing the production enthusiasm of farmers.
    There is no doubt that the vast number of farmers who have suffered from the cruel exploitation of the feudal system for thousands of years, after obtaining land ownership, cultivate and plant on their own land, reaping and using the harvest themselves, without having to flatter landlords or pay rent. Their joyful mood and active production enthusiasm are imaginable. This can be firmly confirmed by the concrete facts of the general increase in agricultural production and the general improvement in the lives of farmers in the old liberated areas.
    However, the reason for charging a fee for issuing land certificates is for financial reasons. In order to consolidate national defense and protect the fruits of revolutionary victory, the government has to have some large financial expenditures. At the same time, in order to continue to consolidate and stabilize financial prices and focus on economic recovery, it has to find ways to increase revenue to reduce the fiscal deficit caused by the expansion of expenditures. This is entirely correct. The decision clearly points out that: each mu of paddy field is charged five jin of fine grain, and each mu of dry land is charged two and a half jin of fine grain. For farmers, the burden is limited, but it plays a significant role in increasing national income and guaranteeing national defense construction and investment in economic recovery. Therefore, actively paying certificate fees to enrich national financial resources is the glorious duty of every farmer to consolidate the fruits of emancipation.
    It is worth mentioning that the issuance of land certificates and the collection of certificate fees is not only a technical work, but also a meticulous and complex mobilization and organization work. In order to successfully complete this task, it is necessary to carry out the work with full preparation, leadership, and planning.
    First of all, all regions must carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization to make the broad masses understand the significance of issuing certificates and collecting fees, dispel the concerns of some people who are afraid of reporting the actual acreage and incurring more burdens, afraid of being punished for discovering undeclared land, and afraid of re-division and re-reform. It is necessary to repeatedly explain the policy of "guaranteeing land rights and developing production" and "reporting undeclared land without investigation or punishment." In areas where more land has been distributed and therefore the certificate fees are also higher, special attention must be paid to publicity and explanation. Only on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses can the work of issuing certificates and collecting fees be done well.
    Secondly, people's governments at all levels must absorb relevant departments, such as: civil affairs, finance, farmers' associations, and other relevant departments to form a certificate issuing committee, to unified leadership, cooperate with each other, and treat the issuance of certificates and collection of fees as an important task. In order to investigate land area, resolve legacy issues in land reform, mediate property disputes among the masses, it is necessary to organize and train a group of specific personnel to handle filling out certificates, compiling registers, collecting fees, and statistics. It is necessary to ensure accurate calculations, clear writing, and proper regulations for fee collection and reporting procedures. Any idea that underestimates this work will result in losses.

### 认真做好颁发土地证和征收证费的工作

　　认真做好颁发土地证和征收证费的工作
    中央人民政府内务部曾于去年十一月二十五日发出《关于填发土地房产所有证的指示》，现在政务院又发布了《关于土地房产所有证收费的决定》，这两项措施，是关系今年新区一亿五千万土地改革区人口的确定地权、巩固翻身果实的一件大事。
    人民政协共同纲领第二十七条规定：“凡已实行土地改革的地区，必须保护农民已得土地的所有权。”土地改革法第三十条规定：“土地改革完成后，由人民政府发给土地所有证，并承认一切土地所有者自由经营、买卖及出租其土地的权利。土地制度改革以前的土地契约，一律作废。”确定地权，颁发土地证，是土地改革中最后的一个阶段。搞好这一工作，对稳定与提高农民的生产情绪，是具有重大意义的。
    毫无疑问，饱受几千年封建制度残酷剥削的广大农民，在取得土地所有权之后，在自己的土地上自耕自种，自收自用，既不需要奉承地主，也不再缴纳地租，他们愉快的心情和积极生产的情绪，是可以想像的。这从老解放区农村生产普遍增加，农民生活普遍向上的具体事实里，可以得到铁的证实的。
    但是，发土地证为什么要收一笔费用，则是为财政的理由。政府为了巩固国防，保障革命胜利的成果，不得不有一些较大的财政开支，同时为了继续巩固和稳定金融物价和重点恢复经济，又不得不设法增加一些收入，以减少因支出扩大而来的财政赤字。这是完全正确的。决定中明确指出：水田每亩收费五斤细粮，旱田每亩收费二斤半细粮，就农民说来，负担是有限的，而在增加国家收入、保证国防建设和恢复经济的投资方面，却起着相当重要的作用。因此，踊跃缴纳证费，充实国家财力，乃是每个农民巩固翻身果实的光荣的义务。
    值得特别提出的是，颁发土地证和收取证费，不仅是一项带有技术性的工作，而且是一项细致而复杂的动员和组织工作。为了顺利地完成此项任务，充分准备地、有领导地、有计划地进行工作是十分必要的。
    首先，各地必须深入地进行宣传动员。使广大群众了解发证收费的意义，打破某些人怕报实田亩多出负担、怕查出黑田受罚、怕重分重改等疑虑，必须反复说明“保障地权，发展生产”和“自报黑田，不究不罚”的政策。在分得土地较多，因而证费亦较多的地区，尤须注意宣传解释，只有在充分发动群众的基础上，才能把发证收费工作搞好。
    其次，各级人民政府必须吸收有关部门，如：民政、财政、农民协会及其他有关部门组织发证委员会，统一领导，协力合作，把发证收费作为重要的工作来作。为了清查土地面积，解决土地改革中的遗留问题，调解群众间的地产纠纷，组织和训练一批办理填证、造册、收费、统计等具体工作人员是必要的。必须做到计算正确、缮写清楚，以及对收费和解报手续均须有妥善规定。任何轻视此项工作的思想，都会招致损失的。
