The people's representative meetings from all walks of life held in various places have powerfully promoted the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Cities like Shanghai, Wuhan, Jinan, Xuzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Nantong, Hefei, Zhangzhou, and Taizhou, as well as many counties in East China and Central South China, districts and market towns in large cities, and even districts and townships below the county level have successively convened representative meetings of people from all walks of life to resist America and aid Korea and protect their homes and defend the country. Many other places have also convened people's representative meetings from all walks of life with resisting America and aiding Korea as the central theme; in many places, people from all walks of life have also convened representative meetings of their respective circles to resist America and aid Korea. Experiences from various places have proven that convening representative meetings to resist America and aid Korea is a good way to cultivate the backbone for carrying out the movement to resist America and aid Korea among the people from all walks of life, and to promote the universal development of this movement among the people from all walks of life.

So, how can we ensure that the representative meetings for resisting America and aiding Korea are successful?

First, there should be preparation for convening the meeting. On the one hand, it is necessary to conduct extensive current affairs propaganda work among the people from all walks of life, and, where possible, also convene current affairs symposiums for representatives from all walks of life, so that representatives from all walks of life have the necessary ideological preparation for carrying out the movement to resist America and aid Korea. On the other hand, the leading organs themselves must be prepared, mainly by preparing reports on the situation of resisting America and aiding Korea and the current (local) tasks, as well as preparing draft documents for submission to the meeting for discussion, including draft patriotic covenants for people from all walks of life.

Second, the personnel attending the representative meetings to resist America and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country should include representatives from all classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations (including religious organizations), and also include representatives of progressive, intermediate, and backward masses as much as possible. The two representative meetings held in Shanghai for resisting America and aiding Korea and opposing the arming of Japan had a majority of representatives from intermediate and backward classes (representatives who originally did not participate much in political activities): those originally progressive only accounted for one-fifth of those attending the representative meeting for resisting America and aiding Korea; and those originally progressive only accounted for less than one-eighth of those attending the representative meeting for opposing the arming of Japan, which proves to be very effective. The originally more backward elements who participated in the meetings quickly raised their awareness during the process of participating in the meetings and actively participated in the patriotic movement. It is necessary to emphasize the broadness of the representatives, because the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda and education movement is a national cause, and this movement should take the broad masses of the intermediate and backward as the main object. Only by mobilizing representatives of the broad intermediate and backward classes to participate in the movement, and then through them to return to the masses to which they belong, and to mobilize the masses to which they belong in the most extensive way, can the propaganda and education of resisting America and aiding Korea be popularized and become a truly national movement.

Third, the meeting should not only have political reports prepared in advance by the leading organs that put forward specific and correct requirements to the local masses of different classes, but also mobilize representatives of people from all walks of life to seriously discuss the report, and also mobilize them to denounce the crimes of the American and Japanese aggressors and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and evil landlords, so that they can educate themselves with their own personal experiences. In order to make such discussions and denunciations thorough, group discussions and denunciations should be carried out before the plenary discussion and denunciations, and typical figures who can carry out denunciations should be discovered and cultivated in the group meetings, so that they can have the greatest educational effect when they carry out denunciations at the plenary meeting. Facts have proved that meetings that adopt this method for discussion and denunciation can quickly raise the patriotic awareness and enthusiasm of all the representatives participating in the meeting, and enable them to learn the methods of leading people from all walks of life to carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

Fourth, on the basis of the improvement of the political awareness of the representatives of the people from all walks of life, they should be further mobilized in group meetings and plenary meetings to discuss the overall political tasks of resisting America and aiding Korea and the patriotic responsibilities of the people from all walks of life, and even to discuss and formulate patriotic covenants for the people from all walks of life. Only by guiding patriotic understanding to patriotic practice can the purpose of convening representative meetings for resisting America and aiding Korea be achieved. However, as long as the previous stage of the meeting is successful, this stage can also be successful. The experiences of various places in convening representative meetings for resisting America and aiding Korea have proved that after representatives of people from all walks of life have denounced the crimes of the United States, Japan, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and landlords, they have expressed their attitudes one after another, guaranteeing to make unremitting efforts to carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea universally and deeply, and determined to resist America and aid Korea with practical work. The workers' representatives from Shanghai, Jinan, and other cities put forward the slogans "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon" and "Further launch patriotic production competitions." The representatives of farmers in the new areas have clearly realized that only by carrying out the movement to resist America and aid Korea and completing land reform can farmers completely turn themselves over; and that eliminating the landlord class is to uproot the roots of American imperialism in China, so they expressed their determination to mobilize the broad masses of farmers, complete land reform, and carry out the production movement. They also put forward the heroic slogans of "If you want money, we have money; if you want food, we have food; if you want people, we have people." Representatives from the business community stated that they would demonstrate their determination to resist America and aid Korea by voluntarily paying taxes. In many places, representatives of people from all walks of life who participated in the representative meetings for resisting America and aiding Korea, in order to express their patriotic determination, discussed their action programs and formulated preliminary patriotic covenants.

Fifth, in order to implement the resolutions of the representative meetings for resisting America and aiding Korea to the broad masses, it is necessary to organize representatives of people from all walks of life to conduct in-depth dissemination to the masses to which they belong after the meeting. Only by doing this step well can the representative meetings for resisting America and aiding Korea become a powerful lever for popularizing the movement to resist America and aid Korea. After the conclusion of the Shanghai People's Representative Meeting Against the American Arming of Japan, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression stipulated the methods of dissemination, proposing that dissemination should be combined with the small meetings already organized by various circles and units, and emphasized the distribution of representatives to the grassroots masses in various districts. After the dissemination by the representatives, workers in many factories, organized by workshops and production teams, and citizens, organized by neighborhoods, denounced the crimes of the United States, Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and then discussed and signed patriotic covenants. Many other places have also adopted similar methods and achieved results. These experiences are worth referring to in various places.

In addition, the duration of the meeting should generally not exceed three days, and the anti-American and aid-Korea representative meetings at all levels below the county and city levels should be shorter, so as not to excessively affect production, study, and work time. The representative meetings jointly convened by several Shanghai streets, which mostly utilized the spare time of production and work, is a method that should be promoted. As long as the preparatory work is done well in advance, it is entirely possible to make the meeting very short and yet solve the problems.

　　怎样开好抗美援朝代表会议？
    朱波
    各地召开的各界人民抗美援朝代表会议，有力地推动了抗美援朝运动。上海、武汉、济南、徐州、杭州、无锡、扬州、南通、合肥、漳州、泰州等城市，华东和中南区的许多县，大城市的区、集镇，甚至县以下的区乡都先后召开了各界人民抗美援朝保家卫国代表会议；其他许多地方，也召开了以抗美援朝为中心议题的各界人民代表会议；许多地方的各界人民，还召开了本界人民的抗美援朝代表会议。各地经验都证明，召开抗美援朝代表会议，是培养在各界人民中开展抗美援朝运动的骨干，使这个运动在各界人民中普遍发展起来的好办法。
    怎样使抗美援朝代表会议开得好呢？
    第一，召开会议应该有准备。一方面是要在各界人民中进行广泛的时事宣传工作，在可能的条件下还应该分别召开各界代表人物的时事座谈会，以使各界代表人物对于开展抗美援朝运动有必要的思想准备。另一方面是领导机关本身要有准备，主要地是要准备好开展抗美援朝的形势和当前（当时当地）任务的报告，以及准备提交会议讨论的各项文件草案，包括各界人民爱国公约草案。
    第二，出席抗美援朝保家卫国代表会议的人员，应该尽可能广泛地包括各阶层、各民主党派、各人民团体（其中包括各宗教团体），并包括进步的中间的和落后的群众的代表人物。上海市召开的抗美援朝及反对武装日本的两次代表会议，中间和落后阶层的代表（原来不大参加政治活动的代表）都占了绝大多数：参加抗美援朝代表会议的原来进步的成份只占五分之一；参加反对武装日本代表会议的原来进步的成份更只占八分之一弱，证明效果很好。参加会议的原来比较落后的成份，在参加会议的过程中，都迅速地提高了觉悟，积极地参加了爱国运动。强调代表的广泛性是必要的，因为抗美援朝宣传教育运动，是全民性的事业，而这个运动，是应该以广大的中间和落后群众为主要对象的。只有发动广大的中间和落后阶层群众的代表起来参加运动，再经过他们回到自己所属的群众中去，把他们所属的群众最广泛地发动起来，抗美援朝的宣传教育，才能普及，才能成为真正全民性的运动。
    第三，在会议上不仅应有领导机关预先准备好的向当地不同阶层群众提出具体正确要求的政治报告，而且应当发动各界人民的代表认真地讨论这个报告，并且要发动他们控诉美国和日本侵略者及其走狗蒋匪和恶霸地主的罪恶，以使他们用自己的切身经验教育自己。为使这种讨论和控诉能够做到深入的地步，应在大会讨论和控诉之前，分成小组进行讨论和控诉，并在小组会中发现和培养进行控诉的典型人物，使他们在大会上进行控诉时，能够发生最大的教育作用。事实证明，采取这种方法进行讨论和控诉的会议，都能迅速提高全体与会代表的爱国认识和积极性，并使他们能够学会领导各界人民开展抗美援朝运动的方法。
    第四，在各界人民代表政治觉悟提高的基础上，应当在小组会及大会上进而发动他们讨论抗美援朝的总的政治任务和各界人民自己的爱国责任，以至讨论订立各界人民的爱国公约。必须把爱国的认识引导到爱国实践，才能达到召开各界人民抗美援朝代表会议的目的。但是，只要会议的前一阶段开得好，这一个阶段也就可以开好。各地召开抗美援朝代表会议的经验都证明：各界人民代表在控诉了美、日及蒋匪、地主的罪恶之后，都纷纷表明态度，保证普遍、深入开展抗美援朝运动而努力不懈，并且决心以实际工作抗美援朝。上海、济南等城市的工人代表们，提出了“工厂即战场，机器即武器”、“进一步展开爱国生产竞赛”的口号。新区农民代表都明确认识到：只有开展抗美援朝运动、完成土地改革，农民才能彻底翻身；而消灭地主阶级就是拔掉美帝国主义在中国的根子，因此，他们表示决心把广大的农民群众发动起来，完成土地改革，开展生产运动。他们并提出“要钱有钱，要粮有粮，要人有人”的英雄口号。工商界代表表示要以自动交纳税款来表明他们抗美援朝的决心。许多地方参加抗美援朝代表会议的各界人民代表为了表示他们的爱国决心，讨论了自己的行动纲领，订立了初步的爱国公约。
    第五，为使各界人民抗美援朝代表会议的决议贯彻到广大的群众中去，就要组织各界人民代表在会后向所属群众进行深入的传达。把这一步工作做好，才能使抗美援朝代表会议成为普及抗美援朝运动的有力杠杆。上海市各界人民反对美国武装日本代表会议结束后，该市中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会即规定了传达的办法，提出传达要结合各界、各单位已组织的小型会议来进行，并强调把代表分配到各个区的基层群众中去。经过代表们的传达，很多工厂的工人以车间、生产小组为单位，市民以里弄为单位控诉了美、日、蒋匪的罪行，接着讨论并签订了爱国公约。其他许多地方也采取了类似的方法，并收到了效果。这些经验，值得各地参考。
    此外，会议的时间，一般地不应超过三天，县、市以下各级抗美援朝代表会议应该开得更短，以免过多地影响生产、学习和工作的时间。上海市几个街道联合召开的代表会议，多利用生产和工作的空余时间进行，是一个应该提倡的办法。只要事先的准备工作做得好，要使会议开得很短而且又能解决问题，是完全可以办得到的。
