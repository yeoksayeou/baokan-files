　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Peace fighters from Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, Mexico, and Canada are enthusiastically supporting the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace pact and have launched a signature campaign. According to TASS, as of the 22nd, the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace had received 6,500 letters requesting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. After the peace pact declaration signature campaign in Austria began on the 15th, the number of signatures in the capital Vienna and Lower Austria in the first three days was equivalent to the number of signatures in the first two weeks of the Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign last year.
　　In recent weeks, peace fighters in Italy have held thousands of peace rallies in various locations, widely publicizing the declarations and resolutions of the First Session of the World Peace Council. In the province of Modena alone, 500 rallies were held. Peace advocates closely combined the work of promoting the peace pact declaration with the work of demanding jobs for unemployed workers and demanding that the government use the funds for arms expansion for peaceful purposes.
　　The Mexican Peace Committee has enthusiastically launched a signature campaign for the peace pact declaration and has begun preparations for the National Peace Congress scheduled to be held in mid-May to further expand the struggle to defend peace. The Canadian Women's Congress held its second meeting in Toronto on the 19th. The meeting passed a resolution supporting the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace pact and other resolutions.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th: TASS, Paris, 24th: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party has recently passed a resolution calling for intensifying the struggle to win a peace pact. The resolution stated: The World Peace Council has pointed out the path that should be followed to save the world from another disaster. In view of the fact that the French people must play a particularly active role in this great global struggle to defend peace, the Political Bureau welcomes the resolution of the National Standing Committee of the French Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom on widely publicizing the peace pact declaration, and calls on all party members and party organizations, together with peace advocates of various political views and beliefs, to actively participate in the work of promoting the peace pact declaration among the masses. In view of the fact that the struggle to intensify the struggle to win a peace pact is consistent with the struggle of the masses to resist the activities of warmongers, the Political Bureau hereby announces that this struggle should be carried out most resolutely and with the broadest spirit of unity. The Political Bureau believes that in the current situation, the French people have a responsibility to strengthen the mass struggle for the conclusion of a peace pact desired by the French people; to intensify the signature campaign against the rearmament of West Germany; and to oppose France's expansion of armaments, in order to strike at the madness of the warmongers who endanger world peace.

    【新华社二十六日讯】捷、奥、意、墨西哥和加拿大的和平战士热烈拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言，并展开了签名运动。据塔斯社讯：捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会截至二十二日为止已接到了六千五百封要求五大国缔结和平公约的信件。奥地利的和平公约宣言的签名运动在十五日展开后，首都维也纳和下奥地利头三天的签名人数就相当于去年斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动头两星期的签名人数。
    意大利的和平战士在最近数星期内，已在各地举行了几千次和平大会，广泛宣传世界和平理事会第一届会议的宣言与决议，单在摩登纳一省就举行了五百次大会。和平拥护者把宣传和平公约宣言的工作，和为失业工人要求职业以及要求政府把扩军经费用于和平目的的工作紧密结合起来。
    墨西哥和平委员会已热烈展开和平公约宣言的签名运动，并已着手筹备定于五月中旬举行的全国和平大会，以进一步展开保卫和平的斗争。加拿大妇女大会于十九日在多伦多举行了第二届会议，会议通过决定，拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言以及其他各项的决议。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：法国共产党政治局顷通过一项决议，号召加紧进行争取缔结和平公约的斗争。决议称：世界和平理事会已经指出了为使世界免遭另一次灾难所应遵循的道路。鉴于法国人民在这一伟大的世界性的保卫和平的斗争中必须起特别积极的作用，政治局欢迎法国争和平自由战士协会全国常设委员会关于广泛宣传和平公约宣言的决议，并号召一切党员和党的组织，与具有各种政见和信仰的和平拥护者一道，积极地参加在群众中宣传和平公约宣言的工作。鉴于加紧争取缔结和平公约的斗争与群众抵制战争贩子的活动的斗争是一致的，政治局特宣布：应该最坚决地并以最广泛的团结精神来进行这一斗争。政治局认为：在目前的形势下，法国人民有责任加强为缔结法国人民所渴望的和平公约而进行的群众斗争；加紧展开反对重新武装西德的签名运动；反对法国扩张军备，以打击危及世界和平的战争贩子的疯狂活动。
