The Ying Shang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the criticism from this newspaper and earnestly addressed the erroneous actions of the Nan Zhao District Committee in suppressing criticism. This is very good. The leading organs of the Communist Party must rigorously address all shortcomings and errors in their leadership of work, earnestly conducting sincere and necessary criticism among party members, the masses, and the people. This is to inspire party members and cadres with a spirit of active responsibility towards the party's policies and work, in order to unite all comrades, educate the people, correct shortcomings, and improve work. The negative consequences caused by the Ying Shang District Committee's suppression of criticism, as the County Committee's self-criticism pointed out, only "fostered the arrogant and rude behavior of individual cadres, causing losses to the Party and the people."

The handling opinions and improvement measures proposed by the Ying Shang County Committee are both correct and necessary. It should be pointed out that the mistakes of some cadres in the Nan Zhao District Committee were not accidental but were due to the existence of an "anti-democratic individual authoritarianism tendency" (as Liu Shaoqi said) within the local party. This erroneous tendency suppressed inner-party democracy and hindered the full realization of the enthusiasm of all party members. For example, many comrades within the Nan Zhao District Committee had correct opinions. However, their correct opinions were suppressed and could not be realized. Party members and the masses had correct opinions, and these opinions were even reflected in the "Wan Bei Daily," but these valuable opinions and calls did not attract the attention of the County Committee. The Constitution of the Communist Party of China clearly stipulates: "The leading organs of the Party at all levels must carry out their work in accordance with the principles of inner-party democracy in order to develop the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of Party members and consolidate Party discipline, and make this discipline a conscious rather than a mechanical discipline, so that the leadership work of the leading organs can be correct, and a centralized system can be established and consolidated on a democratic basis." The Ying Shang County Committee should earnestly expand inner-party democratic life in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution. It should encourage and support all correct opinions, and resolutely carry out an unremitting struggle against the tendency of arrogance, fear of admitting one's mistakes, fear of criticism and self-criticism, and even suppression of criticism.

　　颍上县委应从检讨中取得一些什么教训？
    中共颍上县委员会接受本报批评，认真地处理了南照区区委压制批评的错误行为，这是很好的。共产党的领导机关必须这样严格地对待自己领导下的工作中的各种缺点和错误，在党员群众和人民群众中认真地进行诚恳的与必要的批评，以便启发党员和干部对党的政策与工作的积极负责精神，达到团结全体同志，教育人民、纠正缺点，改进工作的目的。颍上区委压制批评所造成的恶果，正如县委的检讨中所指出的：只是“助长了个别干部的骄傲蛮横作风，造成对党对人民的损失”。
    颍上县委所提出的处理意见和改进办法都是正确的和必要的。应当指出：南照区委中某些干部的错误并不是偶然的，而是由于在当地党内存在有一种“反民主的个人专制主义倾向”（刘少奇同志语）。这种错误倾向压制了党内民主，妨害全体党员积极性的充分发挥。譬如，南照区委内部有许多同志是有着正确意见的。但，他们的正确意见却是受到压抑而无从实现，党内外群众是有着正确意见的，这种意见甚至已经反映到皖北日报上，但是这些宝贵的意见和呼声却没有引起县委的重视。中国共产党党章明确规定：“党的各级领导机关，必须遵照党内民主的原则进行工作，才能发扬党员的革命积极性、创造性与巩固党的纪律，并使这种纪律成为自觉的而不是机械的纪律，才能使领导机关的领导工作臻于正确，才能建立与巩固在民主基础上的集中制。”颍上县委应当认真按照党章规定来扩大党内民主生活。鼓励和支持一切正确意见，坚决同那种自高自大、害怕承认自己错误、害怕批评与自我批评以至压制批评的倾向进行不疲倦的斗争。
