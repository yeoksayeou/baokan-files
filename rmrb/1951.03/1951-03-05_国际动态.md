　　International Developments

　　　　The Italian Communist Party is Growing Stronger
　　The Italian Communist Party is growing stronger. According to incomplete statistics published by the Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" on February 27, approximately 15,000 people have joined the Italian Communist Party in the past few months. Among them, Naples has 4,052, Crotone has 1,366, and Viterbo has 1,069. In the province of Reggio nell'Emilia alone, 1,029 new members have joined the party in the past month. In many other smaller places, the working people are also joining the Communist Party in large numbers. For example, in Agnone, Catania Province, 46 new members have joined the party in the past 20 days.

　　　　Second Group of Hungarian Volunteer Surgical Team Departs for Korea
　　The second group of Hungarian volunteer surgical team, consisting of fifteen people led by surgeon Szellessy, passed through Northeast China on February 28 on their way to serve in Korea. In addition to a large number of medical equipment and medicines, the team also brought clothing and other items donated by the Hungarian people to the wounded Korean soldiers.

　　　　Hong Kong Government Unjustifiably Persecutes Our Compatriots Again
　　The British Hong Kong government continues to persecute our compatriots. At 5:00 a.m. on February 22, the Hong Kong Police Department dispatched plainclothes police officers and unjustifiably arrested Zhen Xiong, chairman of the Hong Kong Naval Dockyard Industrial Workers' Union, and deported him at 4:00 p.m. on the same day. Before his arrest, Zhen Xiong had represented all the workers in the factory in negotiations with the factory management regarding the unreasonable dismissal of sixteen workers. After learning of Zhen Xiong's arrest, the workers in Hong Kong were extremely indignant. Workers from all industries wrote letters and donated money to express their sympathy to Zhen Xiong's family. The naval dockyard workers also held a meeting to protest. Zhen Xiong arrived in Guangzhou on the 25th of last month.

　　　　Desertion Phenomenon Occurs Among Members of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force"
　　The so-called "Police Reserve Force," established by the United States as the core for the revival of the Japanese army, is increasingly dissatisfied with being driven into becoming a mercenary force for the United States, as well as with the poor living conditions and fascist tendencies within the force. As a result, many cases of desertion, resignation, and various forms of resistance have occurred. Eguchi Mitosuru, the deputy director of the "Police Reserve Force" headquarters, revealed in a parliamentary committee in early February that the number of reserve force members who had resigned due to unpaid wages and other reasons had reached 4,000.

　　　　French Pleven Cabinet Falls
　　The French Pleven cabinet submitted its resignation on February 28. The fall of the Pleven government was caused by the inability of the majority parties in the National Assembly to reach an agreement on the so-called revision of the election law. For a long time, the majority parties in the government have been attempting to revise the election law in order to manipulate the so-called electoral system and exclude the French Communist Party from the parliament in the elections to be held this year. However, Zhukov, the correspondent of Pravda in Paris, pointed out that although these reactionary parties agreed on opposing communism, they were also engaged in infighting and trying to seize more seats. As a result, their disputes and divisions over how to revise the election law intensified, until the Pleven government had to resign. After Pleven submitted his resignation, French President Auriol, as usual, summoned Duclos and Marty, the leaders of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group. Duclos announced to reporters afterwards that they had made it clear to Auriol: "The debate on reforming the election law is just a quarrel over the spoils. It must be stated that the people of the whole country are against the policies of poverty, war, and reaction." According to a report in the March 1st "L'Humanité," people all over the country have sent telegrams demanding the establishment of a government of democratic unity.

　　国际动态
            意大利共产党日益壮大
    意大利共产党在日益壮大中。据意共机关报《团结报》在二月二十七日所发表的不完全的统计，在过去数月间，约有一万五千人加入了意大利共产党：其中，那不勒斯有四千零五十二人，克罗多尼有一千三百六十六人，威特波有一千零六十九人。一个月以来，仅在勒佐·尼尔·艾米利亚省，就有一千零二十九个新党员入党。在其他许多较小的地方，劳动人民也纷纷加入共产党；例如喀大尼亚省的阿格尼尼，在过去二十天内就有四十六个新党员入党。
            第二批匈牙利志愿援朝手术队赴朝
    第二批匈牙利志愿手术队十五人，在外科医生雪列西率领下，已于二月二十八日路经东北前往朝鲜服务。该队此次除带来大批医疗器材和药品外，并有匈牙利人民捐献给朝鲜伤员的衣服等物。
            香港政府又无理迫害我同胞
    香港英政府继续迫害我国同胞。二月二十二日早晨五时，香港警务处派遣便衣警察，无理逮捕香港海军船坞产业职工会主席甄雄，并于同日下午四时递解出境。甄雄在被捕前曾代表全厂工人，为该船坞厂方无理开除十六名工人事，向厂方进行交涉。港地工人获悉甄雄被捕消息后，极为愤慨，各业工人纷纷写信和捐款慰问甄雄的家属，海军船坞工人并集会表示抗议。现甄雄已于上月二十五日抵达广州。
            日“警察后备队”队员发生逃亡现象
    被美国作为复活日本陆军的核心而建立起来的所谓“警察后备队”队员，对于该队之被驱为美国雇佣军，以及生活待遇之恶劣与法西斯化，日益感到不满，因此发生了许多逃亡、离职和各种反抗的许象。“警察后备队”本部次官江口见登留于二月上旬在议会委员会曾透露，因拖欠薪金与其他原因而离职的后备队队员，已达四千人。
            法国普利文内阁垮台
    法国普利文内阁已于二月二十八日提出辞呈。普利文政府的垮台，是由于国民议会政府多数各党在所谓修改选举法的问题上争持不下而造成的。很久以来，政府多数各党即企图修改选举法，以便在今年举行选举时，能玩弄所谓选举制度的把戏而把法国共产党从议会中排除出去。然而，真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫指出，这些反动党派虽然协议一致反共，却又各自勾心斗角，想夺取较多议席，因而在如何修改选举法的问题上，争吵倾轧，分裂日甚，终至普利文政府不得不因此辞职。法国总统阿里奥尔在普利文呈辞后曾循例召见法共议会党团领袖杜克洛和马尔梯。杜克洛在事后向各报记者宣布，他们曾向阿里奥尔明白表示：“关于改革选举法的辩论，只是分赃的争吵而已。必须申明：全国人民是反对贫穷、战争和反动的政策的。”据三月一日《人道报》报道，全国各地人民纷纷发出电报，要求成立民主团结的政府。
