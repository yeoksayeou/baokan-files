　　Movie Advertisements Should Be Serious
　　To the Editor:
　　Movie advertisements in Beijing have greatly improved over the past year. Unrealistic descriptions and exaggerations, such as "absolutely wonderful" and "unprecedented masterpiece," have almost disappeared. However, some business-minded and politically un-ideological advertisements still exist. New adjectives like "the high integration of ideology and artistry" are sometimes exaggerated. "The high integration of ideology and artistry" is originally a very high evaluation in new artistic creation and cannot be used casually.
　　Regarding the publication of stills in advertisements, I have also recently seen some inappropriate phenomena. For example, for "Party Certificate," it is absolutely inappropriate to publish a photo of a spy like Pavel Kuganov in the advertisement. Instead, it should be a photo of Anna, who arrested that class alien to protect the Party. It seems that the advertisement does not distinguish this point, only regards them as the main characters in the film, and publishes the photos in rotation, which is obviously inappropriate. The advertisements for "Sisters Stand Up" also often publish stills of Ma San grabbing Tong Daxiang, or stills of the procuress Rouge Tiger and the bully Cui Huzi, or publish stills of the liberated sisters together with them, which are all not very appropriate. In my opinion, the photos in movie advertisements should pay attention to their political propaganda significance and should be closely related to the central idea of ​​the movie. The advertisements for "Sisters Stand Up" should use stills of the sisters after their liberation, and the advertisements for "Party Certificate" should use stills of Anna, who finally saw through the spy's conspiracy and won the victory.
　　If a photo is published casually, or even a still of a negated character who is not important in the film, then where is the propaganda value of this advertisement? What I will never forget in Soviet movie advertisements is the advertisement for "Meeting on the Elbe." The deep and meaningful expression of Soviet officer Colonel Gu Ziming was given a close-up in the advertisement. Many of their advertisements use bright colors to depict positive characters in the main position, while using blue or gray to depict negated characters in the dark. Although copperplate photographs published in newspapers cannot have these conditions, the basic spirit should be consistent. Especially movie advertisements, whose works are in contact with tens of millions of viewers every day, should pay special attention to not causing viewers to have illusions in its propaganda, or even get the opposite propaganda effect.
　　I hope that film distributors and cinemas should pay attention to the responsibility of educating the masses when making movie advertisements, and should not simply proceed from a business point of view.

### 电影广告应当严肃

　　电影广告应当严肃编辑同志：
    北京的电影广告，一年来有很大改进。不切实际的描写和吹嘘，如“美妙绝伦”、“空前杰作”之类的词儿，已经差不多不见了。但某种程度的生意经和缺乏政治思想的广告也还是有的。如“思想性与艺术性的高度结合”之类的新形容词，有时也言过其实。“思想性与艺术性的高度结合”，原是新艺术创作上的很高的评语，不能随便运用。
    关于在广告上刊登剧照，最近也看到一些不应有的现象。比如《党证》，在广告上无论如何不宜刊登像帕维尔·库甘诺夫这样一个奸细分子的照片，而应该刊登为了保卫党而逮捕了那个阶级异己分子的安娜的照片。广告上好像不分清这点，只把他们看做影片中的主要人物，将照片轮流刊登出来，这显然是不恰当的。《姊姊妹妹站起来》的广告，也常刊登马三抓住佟大香的剧照，或则是老鸨胭脂虎和恶霸崔胡子的剧照，或则把翻身姊妹们的剧照和他们一块刊出，这都是不很恰当的。在我看来，电影广告的照片，应该注意到它的政治宣传意义，应该是和该电影的中心思想紧密相关，《姊姊妹妹站起来》的广告，应该用众姊妹翻身后的剧照，《党证》的广告，应该用最后终于识破了奸徒阴谋而取得胜利的安娜的剧照。
    如果是随便登一张照片，甚至是影片中并不重要而又是被否定人物的剧照，那么，这个广告的宣传价值在那里呢？在苏联电影广告中使我久久不忘的是《易比河会师》的广告，苏联军官顾子明上校那种深邃隽永的表情在广告上被加以特写。他们有许多广告是在主体的位置用鲜明的色彩描写正面人物，而在阴暗处用蓝色或灰色描写被否定人物的。在报纸上刊登铜版照像虽不能有此种条件，但基本精神则应是一致的。尤其是电影广告，它的作品每天与成千万的观众接触，便特别应该注意在它的宣传上不要使观众引起错觉，或者竟得到相反的宣传效果。
    我希望影片发行方面与影院方面在做电影广告时应注意到对群众教育的责任，而不要单纯从营业观点出发。
