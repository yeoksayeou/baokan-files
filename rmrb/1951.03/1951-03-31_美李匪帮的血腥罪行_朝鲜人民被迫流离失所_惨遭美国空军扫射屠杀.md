Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 30th: This reporter reports: The American invading army and the Syngman Rhee gang are bloodily persecuting Korean people displaced by the American war of aggression. At the beginning of this year, when the American-Syngman Rhee gang fled from Seoul, they coerced the Korean people in the Seoul area to move south; these forced exiles suffered all kinds of hardships along the way, of whom approximately 120,000 young and strong people were seized by the Rhee puppet army and forced into military service. Even more elderly people, women, and children froze to death, starved to death, and were brutally murdered by the gangs during their exile. During this invasion of Seoul, the American and Rhee gangs drove these haggard and ragged exiles back again. As they trudged along the highway from Daegu and Daejeon to Seoul, the air force of the American invaders brutally slaughtered them. On a ten-kilometer stretch of highway between Sinjeong-dong and Samga north of Suwon alone, 53 Korean people were killed in this way, including 18 children, with the remainder being elderly people and women. On January 28th, in a mountain village near Kimnyangjang, more than 400 returning exiles were bombed and strafed by American planes, resulting in many deaths and injuries.

　　The farmers Lee Geum-seong and Lee Wol-seong, brothers from the outskirts of Seoul, barely managed to escape back to their hometown after being forced into exile for two months, but within a few days, American planes bombed Lee Geum-seong's wife to death and blew off the left leg of his one-year-old son. Lee Geum-seong said with hatred, "I will kill these invaders!" The Korean people's hatred for the American and Rhee gangs has reached its extreme.

　　美李匪帮的血腥罪行
    朝鲜人民被迫流离失所       
    惨遭美国空军扫射屠杀
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】本社记者报道：美国侵略军和李承晚匪帮血腥迫害被美国的侵略战争弄得流离失所的朝鲜人民。今年年初，美李匪帮从汉城溃逃时，曾经胁迫汉城地区的朝鲜人民南移；这些被迫流亡的人民一路上受尽了苦难，其中大约有十二万青年和壮年，被李伪军抓去当了兵，更多的老年人、妇女和儿童，在流亡途中冻死、饿死和惨遭匪帮们杀害了。美、李匪帮在此次向汉城进犯时，又把这些面容憔悴、衣衫褴褛的流亡者赶了回来。当他们沿着从大邱、大田到汉城的公路踽踽而行的时候，美国侵略者的空军又残暴地屠杀他们，仅仅在水原以北新亭洞到三街之间十公里长的一段公路上，被这样杀害的朝鲜人民即有五十三名，其中有十八个是小孩，其余是老人和妇女。一月二十八日，在金良场附近的一个山村中，四百多名北返的流亡者也遭到了美国飞机的轰炸和扫射，死伤很多。
    汉城近郊的农民李今成、李月成两兄弟，在被迫流亡了两个月后好容易逃回了自己家乡，可是没有几天，美国飞机又将李今成的妻子炸死，将他年方一岁的儿子的左腿炸断。李今成愤恨地说：“我要杀死这些侵略者！”朝鲜人民对美、李匪帮的痛恨已经到了极点。
