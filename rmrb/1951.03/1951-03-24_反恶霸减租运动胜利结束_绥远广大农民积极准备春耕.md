Xinhua News Agency, Guisui, March 23rd:

　　The anti-bully rent reduction movement in 84% of the agricultural villages in Suiyuan Province has victoriously concluded, and now the farmers are joyfully preparing for spring plowing.

　　This great rent reduction movement in Suiyuan Province, involving nearly a million farmers, was conducted in an orderly manner under the leadership of farmers' associations at all levels. Twelve thousand farmer activists, who had been trained in advance, played a key role in the movement, actively leading the vast number of farmers to wage a struggle against the landlord class. The farmers of Wuyuan County united to conduct a reasoned struggle against the big bully landlord Wang Leyu (brother of the big traitor Wang Ying). In the past, Wang Leyu had seized over 4,000 hectares of farmland from the farmers, established private courts, privately raised soldiers, and committed countless bloody crimes against the people. The farmers hated him to the bone. This struggle meeting lasted for three consecutive days, and the victims took turns taking to the stage to accuse him of his crimes. After the People's Government accepted the farmers' demands and sentenced Wang Leyu to death according to the law, the farmers were overjoyed, parading and demonstrating with gongs and drums, and the cheers shook the whole city.

　　In the anti-rent reduction movement, the broad masses of rural women also participated in the struggle. When the farmers of Chengguan, Sa County, held a struggle meeting, rural women from dozens of miles away drove in carts to participate, and women accounted for half of the more than 10,000 people present. At present, tens of thousands of young and middle-aged farmers in various parts of the province have successively joined the militia, and 450,000 farmers have joined the Farmers' Association. With the deepening of the rent reduction movement, the feudal Baojia system, which was previously controlled by the landlord class, has also been abolished in the countryside, and the new people's power has been universally established. More than 10,000 farmer activists who have been tempered through struggle have been successively selected as cadres for political power work.

　　In the anti-bully rent reduction movement, the farmers not only defeated the reactionary arrogance of the landlord class, but also legally obtained economic benefits. According to statistics from 710 villages in 20 counties, the farmers recovered more than 60 million catties of grain from the landlords in the form of overpaid rent and the fruits of the anti-bully victory. Now farmers in various places are actively preparing for spring plowing. Farmers in fifteen counties have repaired 18,000 pieces of agricultural implements and purchased 8,657 head of draught animals. Farmers who did not fertilize their fields in the past are now busy collecting and transporting manure, striving for a better harvest.

　　反恶霸减租运动胜利结束
    绥远广大农民积极准备春耕
    【新华社归绥二十三日电】绥远全省农业区百分之八十四的村庄，农民反恶霸减租运动已胜利结束，现在农民们正欢天喜地地准备春耕。
    绥远省这一伟大的有近百万农民参加的减租运动，是在各级农民协会领导下有秩序地进行的。事先经过训练的一万二千农民积极分子，在运动中发挥了骨干作用，他们积极领导广大农民向地主阶级展开了斗争。五原全县农民曾联合起来向大恶霸地主王乐愚（大汉奸王英之弟）进行了说理斗争。王乐愚过去曾霸占农民的土地达四千多顷，并私立公堂，私养家兵，残害人民的血案堆积如山，农民恨之入骨。这次斗争大会连续进行了三天，受害农民纷纷登台控诉其罪行。当人民政府接受农民的要求，依法将王乐愚判为死刑以后，农民们高兴极了，敲锣打鼓示威游行，欢呼声震动全城。
    在减租反恶霸运动中，广大农村劳动妇女也同样参加了斗争。萨县城关农民召开斗争大会时，离城数十里的农村妇女都坐着大车赶去参加，到会万余人中妇女占了一半。现在全省各地已有数万青壮年农民先后参加了民兵，四十五万农民参加了农民协会。随着减租运动的深入，农村中过去为地主阶级所把持的封建的保甲制度也已废除，新的人民政权已普遍建立起来。经过斗争锻炼的万余农民积极分子陆续被选拔为政权工作干部。
    农民在减租反恶霸运动中不仅打垮了地主阶级的反动气焰，而且依法获得了经济利益。据二十个县七百一十个村的统计，农民从地主手中收回多缴的租谷及反恶霸胜利果实共计粮食六千余万斤。现在各地农民正积极作春耕的准备工作。十五个县的农民，已修好农具一万八千件，购买耕畜八千六百五十七头。过去田里不施肥的农民，现在也在忙着拾粪送粪，争取多收粮食。
