    Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 11th: The Seventh Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has concluded.

    The meeting discussed industrial and trade issues. The Soviet representative, in his speech, listed many facts to show that colonial countries, mainly the United States and Britain, had tried every possible means to obstruct the industrial development of Asian and Far Eastern countries, making these countries their raw material production bases and industrial markets, in order to ensure their super-profits. Liu Ningyi, head of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation attending the meeting, spoke during the discussion of this issue, explaining that the real reason for the economic backwardness of Asian countries is that Asian and Far Eastern countries do not have independent and autonomous economies and have long been under the control of foreign monopoly capital.

    In discussing the issue of technical assistance to underdeveloped countries by the United Nations, the head of the Soviet delegation, Nemchinna, said that the Soviet delegation does not object to the United Nations providing technical and other assistance to Asian and Far Eastern countries to develop their economies, however, "technical and other assistance should not be conditional on the countries providing this assistance obtaining political, economic, and military privileges." Nemchinna continued, stating that the Soviet Union assists some Asian and Far Eastern countries in restoring and developing their economies by establishing normal trade and economic relations, and is also prepared to develop its trade and economic relations with all Asian and Far Eastern countries in the future on the basis of mutual benefit and equality.

    The meeting approved the survey report on the economic situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries drafted by the Secretariat of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The Soviet representative believed that this review did not truthfully reflect the situation in Asian and Far Eastern countries, nor did it offer solutions, so the Soviet representative abstained from voting.

    The meeting then approved the International Labour Office's report and its activities in Asian and Far Eastern countries. The Soviet representative did not approve of the report, believing that the report did not offer any suggestions for the difficult situation of the Asian people.

　　亚洲暨远东经济委员会会议结束
    苏联代表发言列举很多事实说明美英阻挠亚洲工业发展
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社拉合尔消息：联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第七次会议业已结束。
    会议讨论了工业和贸易问题。苏联代表在发言时列举很多事实说明殖民国家，主要是美国和英国，曾千方百计阻挠亚洲和远东国家的工业发展，使这些国家成为它们的原料产地和工业市场，以保证他们的超额利润。出席会议的世界工联代表团团长刘宁一在讨论此问题时发言，说明亚洲各国经济落后的真正原因是亚洲和远东各国没有独立自主的经济，而长期的处在外国垄断资本的控制下。
    在讨论有关联合国在技术上援助落后国家的问题时，苏联代表团团长涅姆钦纳说，苏联代表团并不反对联合国对亚洲与远东各国给予技术的和其他的援助，以发展这些国家的经济，然而，“技术的和其他的援助不应以给予这些援助的国家取得政治、经济与军事的特权为条件”。涅姆钦纳继称，苏联凭建立正常的贸易与经济的关系，来协助亚洲和远东若干国家恢复并发展他们的经济，并且也准备将来在互相有利和平等条件的基础上，来发展它与亚洲和远东一切国家的贸易与经济的关系。
    会议批准了亚洲暨远东经济委员会秘书处起草的亚洲暨远东各国经济情势调查报告。苏联代表认为这一篇述评没有真实地反映亚洲和远东各国的情况，也没有提出解决的办法，因此苏联代表在表决时弃权。
    会议接着批准了国际劳工局的报告书及其在亚洲暨远东各国中的活动。苏联代表不赞成该报告书，认为该报告书对亚洲人民的困难处境没有提出任何建议。
