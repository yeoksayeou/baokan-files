The Great Land Reform
Professor Lin Geng, Yenching University

Land reform is a momentous event that turns the world upside down. Thousands of years of feudalism will vanish like smoke. Here, the peasants awaken and become a vast and boundless force. The reactionary remnants are thoroughly suppressed. Thus, the completion of land reform will inevitably lead the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea more forcefully towards victory.

In the high tide of land reform, the peasants have truly stood up. The word "landlord" has become a term of abuse in the countryside. Once the peasants stand up, they possess a high degree of ownership. For example, during my visit to Wujiang, Southern Jiangsu, the cadres of Zhennan Township miscalculated the acreage of Ni Jingqing's land. The cadre initially calculated one acre too many, stating it was 30 acres and seven fen, but the peasants corrected him, saying it was only 29 acres and seven fen. After a long discussion, the peasants were ultimately proven correct. This not only demonstrates the peasants' ability to handle matters but, more importantly, their courageous and responsible sense of ownership. With such an attitude, the peasants will never be enslaved again. The era of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism is gone forever. The peasants have awakened and become masters of their own destiny. They love the motherland, Chairman Mao, and the policies of the Central Committee. They call the land reform policy "Chairman Mao's method." This method calls on them to "unite and yield to each other," and they truly can unite and yield. It calls for "fairness and reason," and they truly can be fair and reasonable. We directly participated in the work of drawing lots and distributing land. Some issues we thought might be difficult were smoothly resolved due to "unity and mutual concession" and "fairness and reason." Now, in Jiangnan, one mu of land is worth approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. For the sake of convenient land distribution, sometimes a peasant might receive three or four fen less land, but they showed no hesitation in helping each other out. We cannot help but sincerely praise this. The shortsightedness and selfishness cultivated by the peasants under feudal exploitation in the past have been washed away in the high tide of land reform. They know that all peasants under heaven are one family, that the working people are a whole, and they have deeply experienced class friendship. All of this undoubtedly educates us as well. Land reform is a great melting pot. It not only burns down the old system but also tempers new people; it not only transforms the peasants but also transforms us, the intellectuals.

In the countryside, militia work is being universally carried out. These militias are all voluntary. They stand guard at night, deliver messages during the day, and check suspicious people. They do not ask for compensation but become more and more happy as they work. Once one village has armbands, every village has them. Once one village has flags, every village has them. At large meetings, the militia lead their villagers to participate, carrying flags and beating drums. At the meeting place, the militia wear armbands to maintain order. The militia have become a glorious name in the countryside. Young people who are not in the militia feel ashamed. At this time, I often think of the Yuefu poetry of the Northern Dynasties:

    Newly bought five-foot knife
    Hanging on the central beam
    Stroking it thrice a day
    More than my fifteen-year-old daughter

The saying "Good men don't become soldiers, good iron isn't used for nails" has completely become a thing of the past. Today's countryside, through land reform, is rapidly changing in every way. Land reform is the pivot of everything. It propels all the people on this land to take the path of courageous revolution. What reactionary elements would dare to appear in the countryside after land reform? They would inevitably be captured by the unarmed people. This year, during the coldest time, some bandits were found frozen to death in the mountains because they did not dare to come to the villages. This is the great power of the people.

As for the cadres in land reform, they are all young people and very lovable. We used to hear that policies would be distorted as they went down to lower levels. This time, we personally witnessed in the land reform that this was not true. They are careful, prudent, have courage and insight, and have the ability to grasp policies. They enabled us to learn more in the land reform. Comrade Lu Xiping, a 26-year-old cadre in Liutang Township, his work is quick, serious, modest, calm, and he leads the mass line, making one colleague could not help but ask him innocently and solemnly: "I ask you a question: are the cadres in other places as good as you?" This sincere question made the young man had to answer: "Some are better than me, and some are slightly worse." This question and answer became a legend among our group in the Zhenze District.

This time, I had the opportunity to learn from the peasants, learn from the cadres, and specifically learn the class stand, the mass viewpoint, and the method of implementing policies. Emotionally, I further approached the working people, and ideologically, I more clearly recognized the greatness of land reform and the inevitable victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

The power of the people is boundless, and the motherland has stood up even stronger!

### 伟大的土地改革

　　伟大的土地改革
    燕京大学教授  林庚
    土地改革是一个天翻地覆的大事，几千年的封建制度从此就要烟消迹灭，在这里农民醒觉起来，成为广大无边的力量，反动的残余被彻底的镇压下去，这样土地改革的完成就必然使得抗美援朝更有力的走向胜利的大道。
    在土地改革的高潮中，农民是真正地站起来，“地主”两个字已成了农村中骂人的名词。而农民一旦站了起来，就具有高度的主人翁态度，例如我这次在苏南吴江参观，镇南乡干部在计算倪镜清的地亩时，干部一时算多了一亩，说是三十亩零七分，农民们便纠正说只有二十九亩七分。双方讨论了许久，后来到底还是农民对了。这里不但说明了农民的办事能力，而更重要的是那勇于负责的主人翁态度。有了这样的态度，农民是再不会被奴役的。半封建半殖民地的时代是永远过去了，农民自己觉悟起来做了主人，他们热爱祖国，热爱毛主席，热爱中央的政策，他们称土地改革政策为毛主席办法。这办法叫他们要“团结互让”，他们就真能团结互让，要“公平合理”就真能公平合理。抽田分田的阶段我们直接参加了工作，有些以为可能发生困难的问题，到时候都由于“团结互让”“公平合理”而顺利的就解决了。现在江南一亩地大约合到七八十万元，为了分田的方便，有时要一个农民少得三四分地，他们为了互助互让，却都毫无难色。这些让我们不能不倾心的礼赞，农民在过去封建剥削下所养成的短视和自私，在土地改革的高潮里已经得到冲洗，他们知道天下农民是一家，他们知道劳动人民是一个整体，他们已深入地体会到阶级的友爱，这些都无疑地教育了我们自己。土地改革所以是一个大熔炉，它非特烧毁了旧的制度，而且锻炼出新的人来；非特改造了农民，而且也正改造着我们这些知识分子。
    在农村，民兵工作是普遍的展开着。这些民兵都是自发的，他们夜里要放哨，白天要跑路送信，检查可疑的人等。他们并不要求报酬，却越作越高兴，一个村子有了臂章，每个村子便都有了，一个村子有了旗子，每个村子也都有了，开大会时举着旗子敲着锣鼓带领本村人来参加的是民兵，到了会场带着臂章维持秩序的是民兵，民兵在农村里已成了光荣的名字，年青人而当不上民兵的便觉得惭愧。这时我便常想起北朝的乐府：
    新买五尺刀  悬挂中梁柱
    一日三摩娑  剧于十五女
    什么“好男不当兵，好铁不打钉”，已完全成为过去的谣谚了。今天的农村，通过土地改革，一切都正在急速的改变。土地改革所以是一切的枢纽，它推动着这土地上一切的人民走向勇敢革命的道路，什么反动分子还敢在土地改革后的乡村出现，他就必然会被手无寸铁的人民抓了起来，今年最冷的时候发现有的土匪，因为不敢走到村子里来，已被冻死在山里了。这就是人民伟大的力量。
    至于土地改革中的干部，他们都是些青年，都是非常可爱的。我们过去常听人说政策越到了下级就越要走样，这回从土地改革里亲眼证明了这话的不对，他们细心谨慎，有魄力有见识并有掌握政策的能力。使我们在土地改革中学习了更多的东西，柳塘乡干部同志鲁希萍是一个二十六岁的青年，他工作的明快、认真、虚心、沉着，以及有领导的走群众路线，使得一位同人忍不住天真而郑重的问他说：“我问你一个问题：别地方的干部是不是也都能跟你这样的好呢？”这由衷之言使得这位青年只好回答说：“有的比我更好，也有的比我略差些。”这一个问答成为我们到震泽区这一组同人中的佳话。
    我这次有机会向农民学习，向干部学习，具体地学习了阶级的立场，群众的观点，与执行政策的方法，在感情上更进一步的接近了劳动人民，在思想上更明确的认识了土地改革的伟大与抗美援朝的必然胜利。
    人民的力量是无边的，祖国已经更强大的站了起来！
