　　CPC Central Committee Directs Party Committees at All Levels
    Guarantee Completion of This Year's Agricultural and Forestry Production Tasks
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th—The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today issued instructions requiring all levels of Party committees of the Communist Party of China and all Party members in rural areas to actively support people's governments at all levels and ensure the thorough completion of this year's agricultural and forestry production tasks. The full text of the instructions is as follows:
    Comrades of Party committees at all levels of the Communist Party of China:
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has passed and promulgated on February 2nd the "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951." The CPC Central Committee believes that this decision of the State Council is very important. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in 1951 and increase the production of more grain to supply more abundant industrial raw materials, all levels of Party committees are required to support people's governments at all levels, accurately grasp the guiding principle of taking agricultural production as the overriding central task in rural work during the agricultural production season, and lead all Party members, members of the Youth League, and peasant masses in rural areas to actively launch a national production movement to ensure the thorough completion of the national agricultural and forestry production tasks in 1951.
                                  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                                        March 5, 1951
