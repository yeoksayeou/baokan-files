Currently, many readers are requesting newspapers and periodicals to publish more short, concise, and accessible articles. This request is legitimate. To meet this legitimate demand, we hope that every author will strive to write more short and concise articles. In his famous speech "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," delivered in Yan'an on February 8, 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong spoke of the first crime of stereotyped Party writing as "empty talk and devoid of substance." This passage is worth reviewing by all of us now. Comrade Mao Zedong said:

	The first crime of stereotyped Party writing is: empty talk, devoid of substance. Some of our comrades like to write long articles, but there is nothing in them, truly "like a lazy woman's foot-bindings, long and stinky." Why must they be written so long and so empty? There is only one explanation, which is the determination not to be read by the masses. Because they are long and empty, the masses shake their heads when they see them and are unwilling to read them. That can only deceive the naive, spread bad influences among them, and create bad habits. Last year (Editor's note: 1941), when the Soviet Union was engaged in such a large war, Stalin delivered a speech on July 3rd, which was only as long as one of our Jiefang Daily editorials. If our lords were to write it, it would be terrible, at least 100,000 words. Now is the era of a great world war, and we should study how to write articles shorter and more concise. Although Yan'an is not yet at war, the army is fighting on the front lines every day, and the rear is also busy with work. If the articles are too long, who will read them? Some comrades in the front also like to write long reports. They work hard to write them and send them to us, with the intention of having us read them, but how dare we read them? Long and empty is not good, is short and empty good? Also not good. We should ban all empty talk. But the main and foremost target is to quickly throw those long and stinky lazy women's foot-bindings into the latrine. Or someone will say, isn't Das Kapital very long, what should be done? This is easy to handle, just read it carefully. As the saying goes: "Sing the song of the mountain you are on." And: "Eat according to the dishes, tailor clothes to the body." Whatever we do, we must handle it according to the circumstances. Articles and speeches are the same. What we oppose is the stereotyped style of empty talk and devoid of substance, not that anything is good if it is short. During wartime, short articles are certainly needed, but especially articles with substance are needed. What should not be done most and what must be opposed most is articles devoid of substance. The same is true of speeches. Speeches full of empty talk and devoid of substance must also be stopped.

　　多写有内容的短文章
    目前很多读者要求报纸刊物多登载短小精粹的通俗文章。这种要求是正当的。为了满足这种正当的要求，我们希望，每一个作者都来努力多写短小精粹的文章。毛泽东同志一九四二年二月八日在延安所作的著名的《反对党八股》的演说中，说到党八股的第一条罪状就是“空话连篇，言之无物”，这段话值得我们大家现在来温习一下。毛泽东同志说：
    党八股的第一条罪状是：空话连篇，言之无物。我们有些同志欢喜写长文章，但是没有东西，真是“懒婆娘的裹脚，又长又臭”。为什么一定要写得那么长，又那么空空洞洞的呢？只有一种解释，就是下决心不要群众看。因为长而且空，群众见了就摇头，那里还肯看下去呢？那只好去欺负幼稚的人，在他们中间散布坏影响，造成坏习惯。去年（编者注：一九四一年）六月二十二日，苏联进行那么大的战争，斯大林在七月三日发表了一篇演说，还只有我们解放日报一篇社论那样长。要是我们的老爷写起来，那就不得了，起码得有十万字。现在是全世界大战争时代，我们应该研究一下文章怎样写得短些，写得精粹些。延安虽然还没有战争，但军队天天在前方打仗，后方也唤工作忙，文章太长了，有谁来看呢？有些同志在前方也喜欢写长报告，他们辛辛苦苦地写了，送来了，其目的是要我们看的，可是怎么敢看呢？长而空不好，短而空就好么？也不好。我们应当禁绝一切空话。但是主要的与首先的对象，是把那些又长又臭的懒婆娘的裹脚赶快扔到茅厕里去。或者有人要说，资本论不是很长的么，那又怎么办？这是好办的，仔细读下去就是了。俗话说：“到什么山上唱什么歌。”又说：“看菜吃饭，量体裁衣。”我们无论做什么，都要看情形办理，文章和演说也是这样。我们反对的是空话连篇言之无物的八股调，不是说任何东西都以短为好。战争时期固然需要短文章，但尤其需要有内容的文章。最不应该最要反对的是言之无物的文章。演说也是一样，空话连篇，言之无物的演说，也是必须停止的。
