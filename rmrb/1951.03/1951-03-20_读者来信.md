　　The Health Bureau of Pingyuan Province Disregards Central Decrees and Repeatedly Demolishes the Historic Sites of Baiquan

Editor:
　　I saw in your newspaper's "Reader's Letter Page" on February 14th, the article "Pay Attention to the Preservation of Ancient Relics and Cultural Objects" written by Comrade Chao Han, which reflected the destruction of the Baiquan scenic spot in Huixian County, Pingyuan Province. This criticism is very necessary, but so far, no relevant authorities have reviewed the situation. I don't know why. The situation as I know it is as follows: Baiquan is a scenic spot of great historical value, with architecture somewhat similar to Longevity Hill in the western suburbs of Beijing, and many historical sites dating back to the Sui and Tang Dynasties. In December of last year, the Health Bureau of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government signed a contract with the private Xijiang Construction Factory of Zhengzhou to build a sanatorium in Baiquan. The contract stated "use old bricks from the mountain" and other words, which led to the demolition of thirteen rooms in the Weiyuan Temple (said to be a Tang Dynasty building) area, the demolition and use of the original foundation bricks of fifty rooms, and the destruction of various inscriptions embedded in the walls since the Song Dynasty (at least twelve known). The Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee and the Huixian County People's Government sent people to investigate and asked them to protect the ancient stone carvings, but the supervisors of the bureau ignored them and caused damage to the historical sites. On January 9th of this year, the Huixian County People's Government noticed the damage to the ancient stele and detained Gu Guoan, a technician from the contractor, but he was released the next day by Hao Jinglin, a supervisor from the Health Bureau. This not only did not cause the bureau to pay attention to the historical sites, but further led to the continued destruction of Xiaotai, Meiliang Hall, and the stone archway in front of the Confucius Temple. On January 17th, the Huixian County People's Government detained Gu Guoan again, and he was released on bail again on the 23rd. The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Health Bureau's failure to pay attention to cultural relics and historical sites and its violation of central decrees should be publicly reviewed.

　　Editor's Note: In May of last year, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the measures for the protection of ancient sites, precious cultural relics, books, and rare organisms, which clearly stipulated that the cultural and educational departments and public security organs of the local people's governments should properly protect local historical relics and ancient sites and strictly prohibit their destruction. However, the Health Bureau of Pingyuan Province has ignored the central decrees and the opinions put forward by the local government, repeatedly demolishing ancient buildings and destroying ancient steles, causing irreparable losses to the historical and cultural heritage. This wrong behavior should be appropriately punished. We hope that the Health Bureau of Pingyuan Province will conduct a strict review of this matter and inform this newspaper of the handling process.

　　The Heavy Workload of the Beijing Railway Management College Affects Students' Health

Editor:
　　Due to unreasonable curriculum reforms, the heavy workload of the Beijing Railway Management College of Northern Jiaotong University has affected the health of the students. Since the beginning of last semester, the Transportation, Materials, and Telecommunications Departments of our college have been changed to the Engineering Department, and the content is mostly the curriculum of general university engineering colleges. Before the curriculum reform, because there was no sufficient deliberation, some teachers still do not know the nature of the department when teaching; the students also do not know the proportion of each course. For example, the Transportation and Materials Departments, in addition to a few railway business courses, their scope is so wide that it involves the courses of the Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Chemical Engineering Departments of the Engineering College. And many courses that are studied for a year and a half in the Engineering College, we only study for half a year. Because these courses are not connected to each other, the students are overwhelmed and have to increase their study time. According to regulations, the weekly study time is about 50 hours, but the actual study time is more than 70 hours. The students are stuck in the house all day doing their homework, and they have no time for recreational activities. Recently, 40 to 50 people a month have been getting gastrointestinal diseases, which is worth noting.
　　We hope that the college can further rationally reform the curriculum and appropriately allocate study time and cultural and recreational activities time so that the students' health will no longer be harmed.

　　Poor Health of Primary and Secondary School Students in Xihua County, the County Education Bureau Should Find Ways to Improve

Editor:
　　The health of students in the county middle and primary schools in Xihua County, Henan Province, is very poor, and many are sick. Just in terms of eye diseases, in Xihua County Complete Primary School, 66 out of 70 students have trachoma, and 30 of them also suffer from photophobia. Most of these diseases are caused by eating too few vegetables and not getting enough rest. Out of 60 students in Xihua County Middle School, only two students are not sick, and none of the female students do not suffer from menstrual problems and anemia.

　　From the above situation, I think that improving the health of students is indeed a matter worth paying attention to. I suggest that the education authorities in Xihua County pay attention to this matter and strive to improve it under the existing conditions.

专栏：读者来信

    平原省卫生局漠视中央法令一再拆毁百泉名胜古迹编辑同志：
    我看到贵报二月十四日《读者来信专页》上，载有超韩同志所写“重视古迹文物保管”一文，其中反映了平原省辉县百泉名胜遭受破坏的情形。这一批评是很必要的，可是至今未见有关机关检讨，不知什么原因。据我所知道的情形是这样：百泉是很有历史价值的名胜，建筑略似北京西郊的万寿山，隋、唐以来的古迹很多。去年十二月平原省人民政府卫生局为修建疗养院，与郑州私营锡江营造厂订立合同，在百泉盖房。合同内写着“用山上旧砖”等字，以致拆毁卫源寺（传为唐代建筑）一带建筑十三间，拆用原有房基砖石五十间、破坏嵌于墙壁的宋代以来的碑碣多种（已知名者有十二块）。该省文物管理委员会和辉县人民政府曾派人前往调查，并请其保护古迹石刻，但该局监工人员却悍然不顾，致使古迹遭受破坏。今年一月九日辉县人民政府察觉古碑损毁，即将包商技工顾国安扣押，但第二天就被卫生局监工人郝景林保出去了。这样，不但没有引起该局对古迹的重视，反而进一步使啸台、没梁殿及孔庙前石坊继续遭到破坏。一月十七日，辉县人民政府再一次将顾国安扣押，二十三日又被保释出去。平原省人民政府卫生局此种不重视文物古迹，违犯中央法令的行为，应公开检讨。
            一读者
   编者按：去年五月，中央人民政府政务院颁布的关于古迹、珍贵文物图书及稀有生物保护办法中，明确规定各地方人民政府文教部门及公安机关对本地的历史文物、古迹应妥为保护，严禁破坏。而平原省卫生局却忽视中央法令及地方政府所提意见，屡次拆毁古代建筑，破坏古代碑碣，使历史文化遗产遭受了不能补偿的损失。这种错误行为，应当受到适当的处分。我们希望平原省卫生局对此进行严格检讨，并将处理经过函告本报。
  北京铁道管理学院功课繁重影响学生健康编辑同志：
    北方交通大学北京铁道管理学院因课程改革不合理，功课繁重，影响了同学们的身体健康。自上学期开学以来，本院运输、材料、电信三系改为工程系，内容多半是一般大学工学院的课程。在课程改革前，因为未能进行充分酝酿，以致至今有些教师授课时不知该系之性质；同学们也不知道每项课程应占的比重。如运输、材料二系，除少数铁路业务课程外，其范围之广，涉及工学院电机、机械、土木、化工四系的课程。并且有许多课程在工学院读一年半的，我们却仅读半年。由于这些课程都互不连贯，使同学们应接不暇，不得不增加学习时间。按规定每周学习时间是五十小时左右，可是实际学习时数确在七十小时以上。同学们整天闷在房子里弄功课，没有时间进行康乐活动，最近每月得肠胃病的就有四、五十人，这是很值得注意的。
    我们希望院方能进一步合理地改革课程，适当地调配学习时间和文化娱乐活动时间，使同学们的身体健康不再受损害。

  西华县中小学生身体不健康县教育局应该设法改进编辑同志：
    河南省西华县县立中、小学学生的身体健康很差，得病的很多。单就眼疾来说，西华县立完全小学，七十个同学中有六十六人有沙眼，并且有三十人同时患眼睛羞明症。得这种病大都是因为吃蔬菜过少和休息不足而引起的。西华县立中学六十人中，只有两个同学没有病，女同学中没有一个不患月经病和贫血症的。
    从以上情况看，我觉得改善学生身体健康情况确是值得注意的问题。我建议西华县教育当局重视此事，在既有的条件下，努力求得改进。
