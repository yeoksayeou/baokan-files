The Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Group has again fulfilled the challenge conditions they proposed to workers nationwide in February, with particularly remarkable achievements in uniting technical personnel and improving tools to enhance production efficiency.

　　The group modified and manufactured a total of four tools in February; among them, the milling cutter bar used for manufacturing part 255 was improved, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. In addition, they also manufactured a special chuck, saving milling and drilling time and improving product quality. In February, the group completed 1,485 precision products, totaling 152 types, with a quality rate of 99.4%, and completed the task five days ahead of schedule. The attendance rate of the entire group reached 100%, with no one taking leave due to illness or personal matters. One of the important reasons for the group's extremely high attendance rate is the good hygiene work they do regularly. The group leader once mobilized everyone to wash clothes and feet more often, keep their housing clean; when the weather is suddenly cold or hot, pay attention to wearing clothes and hats properly when going out; not to eat snacks casually, etc., so workers did not get sick.

　　In order to welcome "May Day" Labor Day, the Ma Hengchang Group has now set forth its striving goals before "May Day" Labor Day. The main contents are: (1) To further unite technical personnel, learn technical principles, and strive for the entire group to learn high-speed cutting methods before "May Day" (excluding apprentices); (2) To improve political and cultural levels, eliminate illiteracy, and strive for all masters and apprentices in the group to be able to understand the "Learn Culture" magazine; (3) Masters should better teach technology to apprentices, and strive for all apprentices in the group to improve by one level technically during the second quarter labor assessment.

　　马恒昌小组实现二月份挑战条件
    改造与制造了四种工具提高了生产效率和产品质量
    并订出“五一”节以前的奋斗目标
    马恒昌先进生产小组在二月份又实现了他们向全国工人提出的挑战条件，尤其在团结技术人员、改进工具提高生产效率上成绩最为显著。
    该组二月份共改造和制造了四种工具；其中，制造二五五部件用的铣刀杆经改造后，工作效率提高两倍以上。另外他们还制造了一个特殊卡子，节省了铣和钻孔时间，并提高了产品质量。二月份，该组完成精密产品一千四百八十五件，共一百五十二种，质量达到百分之九十九点四，并提前五天完成任务。全组出勤率达百分之百，没有一个人因病或因事请假。该组出勤率极高的重要原因之一是平常卫生工作做得好。该组负责人曾动员大家多洗衣服、多洗脚、把住房收拾干净；天气忽冷忽热时，出门要注意把衣服穿好，帽子戴好；不随便吃零食等，因而工人没有疾病发生。
    为了迎接“五一”劳动节，马恒昌小组现已订出“五一”劳动节前的奋斗目标。主要内容是：（一）更进一步团结技术人员，学习技术原理，争取在“五一”节前全组学会高速度切削法（徒工除外）；（二）提高政治、文化水平，消灭文盲，争取全组师、徒都能看懂《学文化》杂志；（三）师傅更好地把技术教给徒弟，争取全组徒工在第二季度考工时，技术上都提高一级。
