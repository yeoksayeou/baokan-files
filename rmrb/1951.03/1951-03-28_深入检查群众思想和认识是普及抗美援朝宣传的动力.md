In-depth Examination of Mass Thought and Understanding is the Driving Force Behind Popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda
    Zheng Jiqiao, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee
    The People's Daily published on the 18th of this month a circular from the CPC Chanan District Committee in January regarding a review of the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work in sixteen villages in Xuanhua County. At a time when Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda is being popularized, the publication of this material should draw our attention. This material raises the point that the effectiveness of Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work should be examined. To answer the question of how well we have done in Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work over the past period and how well the masses understand the Resist America, Aid Korea issue, we should not rely solely on our presumptuous estimates, but mainly on the results of in-depth investigation of mass thinking and understanding. Conducting investigations to identify problems and promote the progress of work is a very good working method and a necessary measure for popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education. The situation revealed in this material regarding our propaganda work in rural areas and the people's understanding of Resist America, Aid Korea – that is, our Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work in rural areas is still far from adequate, and the vast majority of farmers have not yet understood or have a very vague understanding of the Resist America, Aid Korea issue – is probably not unique to the Chanan area. Many rural areas throughout the country probably have similar situations to varying degrees and in different aspects. In other words, the problems regarding Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work discovered by the Chanan District Committee in the rural areas of Chanan are not just a local problem in the Chanan area, but a nationwide problem that should be referred to by all localities.

    There is no question that the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda must be made known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Our country is such a vast country with such a large population that achieving this, especially in rural areas, clearly requires extensive, arduous, and persistent propaganda work. However, from the perspective of leading propaganda work, after a period of vigorous propaganda, we often develop an unfounded complacency, coupled with a certain degree of fatigue, and assume that the propaganda is "almost" done, and relax our efforts. This complacency and fatigue in leadership is undoubtedly the biggest obstacle to advancing propaganda work and achieving popularization. A good way to overcome this obstacle, I believe, is to go to the masses to examine the achievements of our propaganda work, that is, to examine to what extent the masses' thinking and understanding have reached. After checking the masses' thinking and understanding (which is the most accurate yardstick for checking the results of propaganda work), we will find that our propaganda work is actually still far from adequate, and perhaps some facts will surprise us greatly. This will eliminate our complacency and fatigue to some extent and make us more invigorated. The invigoration of leadership is precisely the prerequisite for popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda. At the same time, after checking, we will have a clear understanding of the masses' thinking and understanding, which is also a necessary condition for us to carry out propaganda work well; because, as everyone knows, so-called good propaganda is precisely the kind of propaganda that is carried out in response to the masses' thinking.

    The Chanan District Committee consciously conducted an examination of the masses' thinking and understanding, which played a positive role in launching Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in Chanan. After examining the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work in the above-mentioned sixteen villages, the Propaganda Department of the Chanan District Committee circulated the materials obtained from the examination to the entire district, with the note "Opinions for the Future," which pointed out: "The achievements of Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in the past are affirmative, but in leadership, there is still a serious phenomenon of satisfaction with the status quo, which must be overcome." It also pointed out: "The education of Resist America, Aid Korea must be carried out earnestly and universally in remote mountain villages, truly making it known to every household, women and children. To this end, we must adopt various methods to persist in Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda persistently and tenaciously." It also pointed out that "carrying out Spring Festival propaganda activities is a good opportunity to popularize and deepen Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda, and it is necessary to mobilize all rural cultural and entertainment propaganda organizations to carry out activities." After receiving this circular, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee circulated it to the entire province, pointing out: "What they have done is good and worthy of learning from all localities." It also pointed out: "At present, Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda has not been carried out in depth in rural areas. The main reason for this is that these areas do not attach enough importance to it in their leading ideology." And "I hope that all localities will check the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work and strengthen leadership, combining it with all work to widely and deeply promote this propaganda." Under such circumstances, the Chanan area universally launched Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda activities during the Spring Festival. According to the fragmentary materials at hand: During this period, more than 35,000 organized people in Yanqing County listened to reports or attended meetings. In addition, 60,000 people (out of about 120,000 in the county) preliminarily understood the principles of Resist America, Aid Korea. An inspection of three towns, nineteen central villages, and fourteen fringe villages in Longguan County showed that more than 10,000 people understood the principles of Resist America, Aid Korea. An inspection of twenty-four villages in Sihai County showed that Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda had been carried out more than ten times in thirteen villages, seven times in seven villages, and four times in four villages. The Spring Festival expanded propaganda in Huailai County was promoted to remote mountain paths. In terms of propaganda activities: cadres, primary school teachers, students, and rural cultural and entertainment propaganda groups were universally organized. In terms of propaganda forms: blackboards, loudspeakers, winter schools, reading groups, exhibitions, pictures, magic lanterns, slides, propaganda teams, Yangko dance teams, and dramas were all used. Among them, explaining the history of American imperialist aggression against China with pictures, magic lanterns, and slides was the most popular among the masses. During this period, Sihai County performed 366 short plays related to Resist America, Aid Korea. Four districts in Yu County produced 300 paintings; performed more than 100 dramas, 150 performances; and gave 300 speeches, with an audience of 40,000 people.

    As Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda progressed, the people's patriotic enthusiasm also increased significantly. "Villages with good Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda can do anything well." During the Spring Festival, Chahar Province was calling on the people to participate in the people's armed forces. Twenty-four young people in Erdaoling Village, Longguan County, Chanan, signed up; more than 30 Party and League members in Nanying Village, Huailai County, signed up. Seventy young people in Luzhuangzi Village signed up, volunteering to go to Korea. An old woman in Douying Village said after listening to Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda: "I would rather send my son to fight the American devils." Later, she did send him. Cao Jinrong, a woman in Donghongsi Village, Yanqing, signed up for her husband, and Zhao Keqin, a 65-year-old man, personally sent his son to the front line. In terms of comforting the volunteers, the masses' donations increased dramatically. Some old women took off their earrings, and some women took out their years of treasured silver dollars.

    The purpose of presenting these fragmentary materials above is not to show that the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work in Chanan is done well. On the contrary, the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work in Chanan and even the entire Chahar is still far from the level required. Achieving such a level still requires great and sustained efforts in the future. Therefore, the reason for presenting these materials is to illustrate that after an in-depth examination, the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work in Chanan has made progress; this progress was directly promoted by this examination. It is obvious that only by knowing the real situation of propaganda work, that is, knowing the shortcomings of our Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda, can we arouse our vigilance, increase our attention, and vigorously promote Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work. Therefore, I suggest that in the present situation of popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda, we should also go deep into the masses and examine the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work from the perspective of the masses' thinking and understanding. This, in the sense of leadership, is an important objective driving force for popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and greatly contributes to the development of the popularization movement.

### 深入检查群众思想和认识是普及抗美援朝宣传的动力

　　深入检查群众思想和认识是普及抗美援朝宣传的动力
    中共察哈尔省委宣传部副部长  郑季翘
    人民日报于本月十八日发表了中共察南地委一月间关于宣化县十六个村抗美援朝宣传工作检查的一个通报。在普及抗美援朝宣传的现在，这个材料的发表，应该引起我们的注意。这个材料向我们提出：应该对抗美援朝宣传工作的效果进行检查。过去一个时期我们抗美援朝宣传工作做得究竟怎样，群众对抗美援朝问题的认识究竟如何，要回答这个问题，不应该只凭我们想当然的估计，而应该主要地依据深入群众、对群众思想认识切实调查的结果。进行调查，以便发现问题推动工作的前进，这是一个很好的工作方法，这是普及抗美援朝宣传教育的必要的措施。而这个材料所提供出来的我们在农村中宣传工作的情况以及人民群众对抗美援朝认识的情况——就是说，我们在农村中的抗美援朝宣传工作还做得十分不够，广大农民对抗美援朝问题还没有认识或认识得很模糊——这情况，恐怕也不只察南地区有之，全国各地不少的农村，在不同程度和不同方面，恐怕都有类似的情形，也就是说：察南地委在察南农村中所发现的关于抗美援朝宣传工作中的问题，不只是察南地区的一个地方性的问题，而是一个全国性的问题，应该为全国各地所参照。
    必须把抗美援朝的宣传做到家喻户晓，深入人心，这是没有问题的了。我国是这样广大的一个国家，有着如此众多的人口，做到这一点，特别在农村中做到这一点，很显然需要经过广泛、艰巨、持久不懈的宣传工作。但就宣传工作的领导上来说，经过一番轰轰烈烈的宣传之后，我们常易发生一种无根据的自满，再加上某种程度的疲劳，遂以为宣传得“差不多”了，而松懈了我们的努力。这种领导上的自满和疲劳，无疑是我们把宣传工作推进一步，求得普及的最大障碍。克服这个障碍的一个很好的办法，我以为就是到群众中去检查我们宣传工作的成绩，也就是说，检查群众的思想认识到底达到一个什么程度。经过对群众思想认识的检查（这是检查宣传工作成果的最准确的标尺），就会发现我们的宣传工作，其实还很不够，也许更有些事实会使我们大吃一惊。这样，就会使我们某种程度的自满情绪和疲劳现象为之消除，而更加振奋起来。领导上的振奋，恰是我们普及抗美援朝宣传的先决条件。同时，经过检查，使我们确切地了解了群众的思想认识情况，这又是我们很好地进行宣传工作所必需的条件；因为，尽人皆知，所谓很好的宣传，正是针对着群众思想情况而进行的那种宣传。
    察南地委有意识地进行了对群众思想认识的检查，对于在察南开展抗美援朝的宣传，曾起了积极的作用。察南地委宣传部在检查了上述十六个村的抗美援朝宣传工作之后，曾把检查所得的材料通报全区，并附注了“今后意见”，它指出：“过去抗美援朝宣传的成绩是肯定的，但在领导上，还严重地存在着满足现状的现象，这种现象必须克服。”它又指出：“必须把抗美援朝的教育，认真地普遍深入到山沟小庄，真正做到家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。为此，就必须采用各种办法，把抗美援朝的宣传长期地顽强地坚持下去。”它又指出“开展春节宣传活动，乃是普及、深入抗美援朝宣传的好机会，要发动农村所有的文娱宣传组织，进行活动”。中共察哈尔省委宣传部接到这个通报后，又通报全省，指出：“他们这样做是好的，值得各地学习的。”又指出：“目前抗美援朝的宣传，在农村还未深入地开展起来，究其原因，主要是这些地区在领导思想上重视不足”。并且“希望各地对抗美援朝的宣传工作加以检查，并确实加强领导，结合一切工作，广泛深入这一宣传”。在这样的情况下，察南地区在春节期间，曾经普遍地展开了抗美援朝的宣传活动。根据手头的零碎的材料：延庆县在这个期间，有三万五千多有组织的群众，听过报告或开过会。此外尚有六万人（全县约十二万人）初步地懂得了抗美援朝的道理。龙关县三个镇子、十九个中心村、十四个边沿村的检查，有一万余人懂得了抗美援朝道理。四海县二十四个村的检查，其中关于抗美援朝的宣传，进行过十次以上者有十三个村，七次者七个村，四次者四个村。怀来县春节扩大宣传曾推进到山沟小道。就宣传活动来说：干部、小学教员、学生、乡村文娱宣传团体普遍地组织在里面了。就宣传形式来说：黑板报、广播筒、冬学、读报组、展览、图画、拉洋片、幻灯、宣传队、秧歌队、戏剧，都运用上了。其中以图画、拉洋片、幻灯来讲解美帝国主义侵华的历史，最受群众的欢迎。在这一期间，四海县演出有关抗美援朝的小剧三百六十六个。蔚县四个区，出画三百张；演剧一百余个，演出一百五十次；讲演三百次，听众观众四万人。
    由于抗美援朝的宣传进了一步，群众的爱国热忱也有着显著的提高。“抗美援朝宣传好的村庄，什么工作都好做了”。春节期间，察哈尔省正在号召人民参加人民的武装，察南龙关县二道岭村有二十四名青年报了名；怀来县南营村党团员报名者有三十多名。吕庄子村有七十个青年报名，志愿赴朝。豆营一个老太太听了抗美援朝的宣传后，说：“我情愿送我的儿子打美国鬼子去。”后来，她果然送来了。延庆东红寺村妇女曹金荣替丈夫报名，六十五岁的赵克勤老汉亲送其子上前线。在慰劳志愿军方面，群众捐献，顿呈踊跃，有的老太太把自己的耳环摘下，有的妇女将自己多年珍藏的白洋拿出。
    提出上边这些零碎的材料，并不是为了说明察南抗美援朝宣传工作做得很好。相反，察南以至整个察哈尔抗美援朝的宣传工作，距离所需要达到的程度，还远得很。达到这样一个程度，尚有待于今后持久不懈的很大的努力。所以提出这些材料，是为了说明：在经过一次深入的检查之后，察南的抗美援朝宣传工作，有了进展；这进展，是直接为这一次的检查所推动的。很明显：只有知道了宣传工作的实况，也就是说，知道了我们抗美援朝宣传的不足，才能引起我们的警惕，提高我们的重视，而用大力把抗美援朝的宣传工作，推动起来。所以，我建议：在普及抗美援朝宣传的现在，我们应同时深入群众，从群众思想认识上，把抗美援朝的宣传工作，检查一次，这在领导意义上来说，是普及抗美援朝宣传的一个重要的客观的推动力量，大有助于普及运动的开展的。
