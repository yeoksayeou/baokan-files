Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 26th: Guangxi Provincial People's Court, Guilin Branch, sentenced bandit leaders Zhong Zupei and Lin Xuxun, who instigated the Gongcheng County riot, to death. The sentences have been approved by the Provincial People's Government and carried out by firing squad.

　　Zhong and Lin were both from Gongcheng County and former subordinates of the Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi bandit gang. Zhong served as a puppet division commander, army commander, and bandit "Commander-in-Chief of the Xiang-Gui Border Region." Lin served as the puppet Gongcheng County Speaker. After the liberation of Gongcheng, Bai's bandits dispatched special agents from Hong Kong to contact Zhong, plotting a riot, and provided twenty taels of gold as funding. Zhong then gathered bandits and established the "Gongcheng County Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Headquarters," starting a riot on January 25th of last year. However, our suppression troops quickly put it down, and Zhong and Lin were captured by us. During the Gongcheng riot, Zhong and Lin bandits killed more than 350 of our military, government personnel, and peasant activists, robbed the government of over one million catties of public grain, and caused more than ten billion yuan in losses to the people's property. Revolutionary workers arrested by the bandits were all killed, some with their eyes gouged out and abdomens cut open, others with their limbs severed or burned alive with kerosene. The local people were filled with hatred for the inhuman atrocities of these special agent bandits. While Zhong and Lin were detained and interrogated by the Guilin Public Security Bureau, the Provincial People's Government received more than 2,000 joint letters of accusation, demanding the settlement of blood debts and severe punishment. The Guilin Branch of the Provincial People's Court sentenced Zhong and Lin to death on the 27th of last month. With the approval of the Provincial People's Government, the execution by firing squad was carried out on the same day.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 27th: Yi Pinzhen, one of the creators of the Fujian "Yong'an Prison" incident and the special agent bandit who murdered the famous international affairs expert Yang Chao, was executed in Changsha City on the 12th of this month. Bandit Yi Pinzhen, also known as Yi Zhen, joined the Kuomintang secret service organization in 1937 and was a high-ranking special agent fostered by the US-Chiang clique. He served as the puppet "Traffic Police Headquarters Political Work Department Major General Director." In July 1945, when Yi was the head of the KMT Fujian Station, he colluded with American spy Lander (Director of the US Information Service in Yong'an and Nanping, Fujian Province) to create the "Yong'an Prison" incident, arresting and killing a group of patriotic people. Yang Chao (pen name Yang Zao) was one of the victims. Yi was determined to be an enemy of the people and was favored by American imperialism and the Chiang bandits. The following year (1946), he was sent to the New Jersey Police Academy in the United States for training. Before liberation, he was sent back to Hunan by the KMT secret service to prepare for lurking and carrying out sabotage activities. After liberation, he was captured by our public security organs and brought to justice. After being tried by the Military Control Commission Military Law Department of Changsha City, he was executed by firing squad.

    钟、林两匪首是恭城县人，为李宗仁、白崇禧匪帮旧部。钟匪历任伪师长、军长及匪“湘桂边区总指挥”等职。林匪曾任伪恭城县议长。恭城解放后，白匪曾派遣特务分子自香港潜入与钟匪联络，策划暴乱，并发给黄金二十两作为经费。钟匪即纠集匪徒，成立“恭城县反共救国军总指挥部”，于去年一月二十五日开始暴乱，但经我剿匪部队迅速扑灭，钟、林二匪亦为我捕获。钟林二匪首在恭城暴乱期间，计杀害我军、政工作人员及农民积极分子达三百五十余人，抢劫政府公粮一百余万斤，人民财物损失在十亿元以上。凡为匪徒所逮捕的革命工作人员，均遭杀害，有被剜眼剖腹的、有被斩断四肢或浇以火油烧死的。当地人民对于特务匪徒的这些残无人性的兽行莫不切齿痛恨。钟、林二匪首在桂林市公安局拘押侦讯期中，省人民政府曾先后收到二千余人的联名控诉书，要求清算血债，予以严办。省人民法院桂林分院于上月二十七日判处钟、林两匪首死刑，经省人民政府批准，于当日执行枪决。
    【新华社长沙二十七日电】福建“永安大狱”事件制造者之一、杀害著名国际问题专家杨潮的特务匪徒易聘珍，已于本月十二日在长沙市伏法。易匪聘珍又名易珍，于一九三七年参加国民党特务组织，是美蒋豢养的高级特务，曾任匪“交通警察总局政工处少将处长”。一九四五年七月，易匪任军统福建站站长时，与美国间谍蓝德（福建省永安、南平美国新闻处主任）勾结，制造了“永安大狱”事件，捕杀了一批爱国志士，杨潮（笔名羊枣）即是其中被害者之一。易匪死心塌地与人民为敌，受到美帝国主义与蒋贼的宠爱，翌年（一九四六年）被派去美国新泽西警官学校受训。解放前被军统特务机关派回湖南准备潜伏，进行破坏活动。解放后，被我公安机关捕获归案，由长沙市军事管制委员会军法处审讯后执行枪决。
