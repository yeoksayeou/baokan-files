Xinhua News Agency, 5th. According to Vietnam News Agency's Laotian dispatch: The Lao People's Liberation Army's activities in southern Laos have been increasing in recent months. They have launched a series of attacks on French forces in the larger cities of southern Laos, such as Beisha, Attopeu, and Bassa, inflicting losses on the enemy. People's Liberation Army units and militia ambushed enemy motorized units in the Bassa area, destroying eight military vehicles and damaging many roads. Recently, the People's Liberation Army eliminated the enemy's stronghold at Muang Kong, defended by a small detachment, and captured twenty machine guns and rifles.

The Lao People's Liberation Army's increasingly vigorous activities have encouraged the Lao people, who are now fully supporting the victorious army.
