Reaction to People's Daily Criticism and Suggestions

　　Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau
    Accepts Public Criticism, Improves Work Style and Work System
    Editor:
    After reading the article "Beijing Municipal Health Bureau Disregards People's Lives" and the accompanying editor's note published in your newspaper's "Reader's Letters" section on February 14th, we immediately conducted a thorough self-examination. Regarding the poisoning of the family of Li Shiming, a resident of Xihongmen in the southern suburbs of Beijing, our bureau failed to take the initiative to provide timely treatment and did not fulfill its responsibility to protect the people's health. This is a serious manifestation of bureaucratic work style, and we will definitely work hard to improve and thoroughly correct it in the future.
    The criticism from the Southern Suburbs Public Security Sub-bureau is very helpful for us to improve our work, and we sincerely accept it. The article stated: "The Southern Suburbs Sub-bureau first called the Second Division of the Health Bureau, who told them to call the Chief's Office. When they called the Chief's Office, they were told to call the Epidemic Prevention Team." Our bureau's Second Division does not have a Chief's Office, and it is possible that the Southern Suburbs Sub-bureau called another division and mistakenly thought it was the Second Division. However, when asked, the Southern Suburbs Sub-bureau stated that they could no longer remember the phone number. Therefore, we cannot identify the person who initially answered the phone or hold them accountable. In order to overcome shortcomings in our work in the future, in addition to strengthening work inspections, we will also establish a telephone record system, recording the name of the caller, the content of the conversation, and the time in detail, so as to facilitate tracing responsibility.

### 北京市人民政府公共卫生局  接受群众批评，改进作风与工作制度

　　北京市人民政府公共卫生局
    接受群众批评，改进作风与工作制度编辑同志：
    贵报二月十四日《读者来信专页》刊登“京市卫生局漠视人民生命”一稿及所附编者意见，我们读后当即进行了深刻检讨。对于本市南郊西红门住户李世明家人中毒，本局未能主动及时前往救治，没有尽到保护人民健康的责任。这是严重的官僚主义作风，今后一定努力改进，求得彻底纠正。
    南郊公安分局所提批评，对我们改进工作很有帮助，我们诚恳的接受。稿内所谈：“南郊分局先给卫生局二科打电话，他们让叫科长室，给科长室打电话时，又让叫防疫队。”本局二科并无科长室，可能南郊分局给其他科打了电话而误为二科。但询及南郊分局时，据称已记不清电话号码了。因此，不能查清最初接电话的人，追究责任。今后为了克服工作中的缺点，除加强对工作的检查外，并建立电话记录制度，将谈话人姓名、接话内容及时间等均作详细记录，以便追查责任。
                              北京市人民政府公共卫生局
