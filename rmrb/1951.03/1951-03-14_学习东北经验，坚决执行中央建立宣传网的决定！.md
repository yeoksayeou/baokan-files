Learning from the Northeast Experience, Resolutely Implement the Central Committee's Decision to Establish a Propaganda Network!
    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued its decision on January 1 this year regarding the establishment of a propaganda network for the masses of people throughout the Party, the central bureaus and several provincial and municipal Party committees have made decisions or issued instructions to implement this decision, stipulating specific plans and methods. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also convened a meeting of propaganda representatives to exchange propaganda experiences and summarize past work. The construction of the Party's propaganda network is gradually unfolding. The Northeast region has made the earliest and greatest achievements in establishing a propaganda network. Therefore, we specially published news yesterday about the establishment of a propaganda network in the Northeast region, and starting today, we will serialize a lengthy communication, "The Experience of Establishing a Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region," written by Comrade Fu Zhensheng of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, hoping that Party organizations in other regions of the country will pay attention to studying it to facilitate the rapid promotion of propaganda work.
    After a period of effort in the Northeast region last year (mainly after October last year), by the end of last year, a propaganda team of about 120,000 propagandists had been established. After the Central Committee's decision on January 1 this year, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee decided to further develop propagandists, so the number of propagandists in the Northeast must now exceed this number. The propagandists in the Northeast not only have a huge quantity, but more importantly, they have shown a huge role in cities and rural areas, becoming the main link for the Party to connect with and mobilize the masses. This fact proves that the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network is completely correct and completely feasible.
    The basic key to the success of the propaganda work in the Northeast region is that the Party committees at all levels fully recognize the necessity of regular, universal, and systematic propaganda work. Whoever fully recognizes this necessity will not doubt the huge benefits of establishing a propagandist system, and will not hesitate to carry out this important work because of various possible difficulties. Just as when this experiment was promoted in the Northeast, it encountered various doubts and had to be overcome one by one, today other regions also encounter some doubts when implementing the Central Committee's decision, and these doubts must also be overcome.
    One of the most popular doubts is: Propaganda cannot be eaten, why spend so much effort on it? It is true that propaganda alone, without other organizational work, cannot complete the work. However, correct propaganda can raise the patriotic enthusiasm and political consciousness of the people, make them understand that the policies and decisions of the Party and the government are correct and necessary, so as to actively act and turn the requirements of the Party and the government into reality. Our Party and government are essentially different from the landlord and bourgeois parties and governments. All policies and decisions must and can rely on the active actions of the broad masses of the people to achieve. The broad masses of the people will only give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity and strive to act when they have political consciousness and believe that the policies and decisions of the Party and the government truly represent their interests. Therefore, it can be said that if the propaganda work is done well and the broad masses of the people are truly mobilized, then half of the work has already been done.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his book "On the Party": "All the undertakings of us Communists are the undertakings of the people. No matter how correct our programs and policies are, they cannot be realized without the direct support and persistent struggle of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, everything we do depends on and is determined by the consciousness and initiative of the people. Without relying on the consciousness and initiative of the masses, we will accomplish nothing and get nothing done. But as long as we rely on the consciousness and initiative of the masses, as long as the masses have genuine consciousness and genuine mobilization, and with the correct leadership of our Party, all the great undertakings of our Party will surely achieve final victory and success. Therefore, we Communists - the vanguard of the masses of the people - no matter what work we are going to carry out, when the masses are not yet conscious, our responsibility is to use all effective and appropriate methods to enlighten the consciousness of the masses, no matter how arduous and how long it takes, this first step must be done well; because only by doing this first step well can we enter the second step, that is, when the masses have already had some necessary consciousness, our responsibility is to guide the actions of the masses, guide the masses to organize and struggle; after the masses are organized and struggle, we will further enlighten the masses from the actions of the masses. In this way, step by step, we will guide the masses to fight for the basic slogans of the people put forward by the Party."
    And propaganda is precisely the main method of enlightening the consciousness of the masses.
    When the Northeast began to establish a propaganda network, many people held attitudes of contempt and opposition. Some people even said rudely: "Coal is dug out shovel by shovel, not propagandized." However, what are the facts? After propaganda, the workers became active, and the output of coal in the mine increased by 50%. At this time, the "skeptics" said as if they had discovered a miracle: "Coal was really propagandized!" Many people who did not believe in the power of propaganda before had to revise their wrong understanding in the face of countless facts and admit: "If the masses' thinking is clear, everything is easy to handle, and tasks can be completed without coercion." However, this phenomenon does not only occur in the Northeast. Throughout the country, after the patriotic political propaganda against US aggression and aid to Korea, haven't all tasks such as grain requisitioning, taxation, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and increased production been easier to promote and complete than before?
    Another popular suspicion about the implementation of the propagandist system is: "There are too many tasks, and we are too busy"; or: "Propaganda will affect the central work," "Establishing a propaganda network contradicts the current urgent tasks." These comrades regard propaganda work as an isolated and abstract work, because they separate propaganda from other tasks, so they regard it as an extra burden. In fact, which "central work" and "urgent task" can be separated from propaganda? Any idea that opposes propaganda work to other tasks is wrong. There has never been and should not be any isolated propaganda work. Part of the Party's propaganda work serves the Party's theory, the Party's general program, and the general line, which can be called education work; while the Party's daily propaganda work or mobilization work serves the Party's various "central work" and "urgent tasks." Separating propaganda work from practical work, and thus canceling propaganda work on the pretext of being busy with practical work, is an important reason why the Party's middle and lower-level organizations lack regular propaganda work and therefore often commit bureaucratic and commanding errors in their work. The Party Central Committee clearly pointed out in the decision on establishing a propaganda network: "The task of propagandists, under the leadership of Party organizations, is to regularly use simple and easy-to-understand forms to carry out propaganda and explanation to the people around them about domestic and foreign current affairs, the policies of the Party and the People's Government, the tasks of the people, especially the direct tasks of the time and place, and the model experiences of the people in production and labor and other work, criticize various reactionary rumors and erroneous ideas circulating among the people, mobilize the people to learn from model experiences, actively complete tasks, and regularly report the situation of the people to Party organizations, in order to help Party organizations determine appropriate propaganda content and methods for various periods." Therefore, developing propagandist work should not hinder various urgent tasks and central work, but should be developed in the course of these tasks and work, and should lead propagandists to promote the progress of various tasks and work, so that they can be completed more smoothly. Propaganda work can only be done well when it is combined with the specific tasks and work of the time and place, and various tasks and work must also rely on propaganda methods to avoid relying on coercive methods and breaking away from the masses.
    Now our comrades in various places do have many tasks and are very busy. This is because the environment our country is in today does require the Party, the government, and the people to do many things. However, the reason why the work of some organs and some comrades is chaotic and busy is also because their working methods are not correct. They often use methods of breaking away from the masses, taking over everything, and coercion to carry out their work, and are not good at enlightening the political consciousness of the masses, promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and mobilizing the broad masses to work together. In this way, they often make themselves busy to death, but the work is still not done well. Therefore, the more work there is and the busier they are, the more they should carry out propaganda and strive to mobilize the masses. In order to make propaganda work regular, universal, and systematic, a propaganda network must be established, and there is no other way. The experiences of the Northeast and other places have repeatedly proved: "With propagandists, work is much easier to do. In the past, it was a few people who were busy, but now everyone is doing it." That is to say, if the propaganda team is established well, it will not only not increase "busyness," but can reduce the "busyness" of the leaders!
    There is also a not very open opinion that suspects propagandist work: "The masses do not need regular propaganda. The more propaganda to the masses, the more problems the masses have, and the more trouble there will be." This opinion is simply an anti-people and anti-democratic opinion. Please see what Stalin said about these people! In his report at the meeting of activists of the Moscow Party organization on May 9, 1925, Stalin said:
    "Some of our leaders often get things done by issuing orders, which is of course much easier and simpler. However, not everything that is simple and easy is good. Not long ago, a secretary of a town committee replied to the representative of the provincial committee about the lack of newspapers in the town, saying: 'Why do we need newspapers? It is quieter and more appropriate without newspapers, otherwise, once the peasants read the newspapers, they will question everything, which is very troublesome.' This secretary is also called a Communist! There is really no need to prove that this is not a Communist, but an unfortunate thing. Comrades, in fact, to implement leadership now, there must be 'trouble,' and it is even more impossible without newspapers. If we want to maintain the leadership of the Party and the Soviet regime in the countryside, we must understand and comprehend this simple truth." (See "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," Volume 1, page 549)
    "To implement leadership, there must be 'trouble,'" This sentence is the same as what Comrade Mao Zedong often said, "Revolution is another name for trouble," this idea should be deeply understood. Will propaganda of current affairs policies and work tasks to the people increase "trouble" instead? "Trouble" may increase a little, because your work is not done well, the masses do not understand what you are saying, or do not believe that what you say is correct. Then you need to continue to carry out propaganda. Without propaganda, the "trouble" will be even greater. If the masses know less, they may ask you less "questions," but they will also leave you, not believe you, and go to believe counter-revolutionary rumors. Therefore, if you want to avoid trouble, it will definitely be more troublesome. Only by explaining the truth to the masses and making the Party's ideology and policies mastered by the masses can we truly reduce trouble. The experiences of the Northeast and other places have proved that in places where propaganda work is done well, the masses understand current affairs, policies, and tasks, know the bottom line, know the numbers, and understand why they should do so, they will act nervously, rumors will disappear, and there will be much less trouble.
    Finally, some comrades said: "Okay, since we must establish a propaganda network, then hand it over to the Propaganda Department." They regard the Party's propaganda work as the work of a few propaganda department staff. No, propaganda work is the business of the whole Party, not just a few people. Our Party's constitution clearly stipulates in the article on the obligations of Party members that Party members should "serve the people, consolidate the Party's ties with the people, understand and timely reflect the needs of the people, and explain the Party's policies to the people." Especially in such a major event as establishing a propaganda network for the masses of the people throughout the Party, we must never rely solely on a few working comrades in the Propaganda Department to do it, but the Party committee and the main responsible persons of the Party must personally lead the work. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the Propaganda Department should be responsible for the daily management and guidance of propaganda work, but whether the work is done well mainly depends on the leadership of the Party committee. The experiences of the Northeast and other places tell us that the work is done well wherever the Party committee attaches importance to propaganda work and has established a regular and systematic leadership system for propaganda work. Otherwise, the work will not be done well. Now some local Party committees, after receiving the Party Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, simply handed it over to the Propaganda Department for handling, without seriously discussing it in the Party committee or having practical plans, arrangements, and inspections. This will never get the job done well.
    The Party Central Committee pointed out in the decision on establishing a propaganda network: "The Party committees of each province and city should formulate specific plans for implementing this decision within half a year in accordance with local conditions, report them to the central bureaus to which they belong for approval, and regularly check the implementation status in order to achieve them on schedule." Of course, what the Central Committee said here about "formulating specific plans for implementing this decision within half a year in accordance with local conditions" does not mean that it is required to universally establish a propaganda network in urban and rural areas throughout the country within half a year, but rather that each region is required to formulate a six-month work plan that is permitted by local conditions. Especially in new areas where Party organizations have not been developed on a large scale, the Central Committee's decision does not focus on organizing the Party's propaganda network, but "focuses on organizing a non-Party propaganda network in an appropriate form." But all this should not be an excuse for relaxing the efforts of the whole Party. In all cities, rural areas, industrial and mining areas, and organs and schools where Party organizations are relatively sound, the achievements of the Northeast in trying out the propaganda network in the last half of last year should be exceeded in the first half of this year. The Northeast last year did not have the decision of the Central Committee, nor did it have ready-made experience, and the main work was only in the last two or three months of last year, so there is no reason why the achievements of other regions this year should not catch up with the Northeast last year. Therefore, in all places where there are conditions, Party committees at all levels should follow the decision of the Central Committee, learn from the experience of the Northeast, and seriously establish the propaganda network in the current anti-US aggression and aid Korea work, development production work, strengthen trade union work, suppress counter-revolutionary work, and other important tasks, first with emphasis, and then on a large scale!

### 学习东北经验，坚决执行中央建立宣传网的决定！

　　学习东北经验，坚决执行中央建立宣传网的决定！
    自从中国共产党中央委员会在今年一月一日发表了关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定以后，各地党的中央局和若干省委、市委，都已作了执行中央这一决定的决定或指示，规定了具体的计划和办法。中共中央东北局宣传部并且召开了宣传员代表会议，交流了宣传员的经验，总结了以往的工作。党的宣传网的建设工作已在逐渐地展开。在建立宣传网的工作中，进行最早成绩最大的是东北区。因此，我们昨天特地发表了关于东北区建立宣传网情况的新闻，并且从今天起连载中共中央东北局宣传部富振声同志所写的长篇通讯《东北区建立宣传网的经验》，希望全国其他各区的党组织注意研究，以利于宣传员工作的迅速推广。
    东北区经过去年一个时期（主要是去年十月以后）的努力，到去年年底已经建立了约有十二万名宣传员的宣传队伍。在中央今年一月一日的决定以后，中央东北局决定进一步发展宣传员，因此现在东北的宣传员人数必已超过此数。东北的宣传员不但有了巨大的数量，更重要的是已经在城市和农村中显出了巨大的作用，成为党联系群众动员群众的主要的纽带。这个事实，证明中央关于建立宣传网的决定是完全正确的，并且是完全可能实现的。
    东北区发展宣传员工作得到成功的基本关键，就是各级党委充分认识了经常的普遍的有系统的宣传工作的必要。谁要是充分认识了这个必要，谁就不会怀疑建立宣传员制度的巨大利益，谁就不会因为种种可能的困难而对于这一项重要工作踌躇不前了。如同在东北推行这一试验时，曾经遇到过种种怀疑并必须一一加以克服一样，今天其他地区在执行中央的决定时也遇到了一些怀疑，也必须克服这些怀疑。
    一种最流行的怀疑就是：宣传又不能当饭吃，为什么要花这样大的气力呢？不错，光宣传，不进行其他组织工作，是无法把工作完成的。但正确的宣传却能提高人民群众的爱国热情和政治自觉，使他们懂得党和政府的政策和决定是正确的，必要的，从而积极地行动起来，把党和政府的要求变成实际。我们的党和政府跟地主资产阶级的党和政府有着本质上的不同，一切政策和决定都必须也可能依靠广大人民群众的积极行动来实现。而广大人民群众却只在有了政治自觉，相信党和政府的政策和决定确实是代表他们的利益时，才会充分地发挥他们的积极性和创造性，努力行动起来。所以，可以说，如果把宣传工作作好，把广大人民群众真正地动员了起来，那么工作就已经作好了一半。
    刘少奇同志在《论党》一书中说：“我们共产党人的一切事业，都是人民群众的事业，我们的一切纲领与政策，不论是怎样正确，如果没有广大群众的直接的拥护和坚持到底的斗争，都是无法实现的，所以我们的一切，都依靠于、决定于人民群众的自觉与自动，不依靠于群众的自觉与自动，我们将一事无成，费力不讨好。但只要我们依靠于群众的自觉与自动，只要群众有了真正的自觉与真正的发动，又有我们党的正确领导，我们党的一切伟大事业，都一定要获得最后的胜利与成功。因此我们共产党人——人民群众的先锋队，不论去进行任何工作，当着群众还没有自觉时，我们的责任，就是用一切有效的适当的方法去启发群众的自觉，不论如何艰苦，需要如何长久的时间，这首先的第一步工作，是必须作好的；因为只有作好了这第一步，才能进入第二步，即是当着群众已经有了某种必要的自觉以后，我们的责任，就是去指导群众的行动，指导群众组织起来，斗争起来；在群众组织起来，斗争起来以后，我们再从群众的行动中去启发群众的再自觉。这样，一步一步地引导群众去为党提出的人民群众的基本口号而斗争。”
    而宣传，却正是启发群众的自觉的主要方法。
    东北在开始建立宣传网的时候，也曾有很多人抱着轻视和反对态度。甚至有人这样粗暴地说：“煤是一锹锹地挖出来的，不是宣传出来的。”然而，事实怎样呢？经过宣传，工人积极起来了，矿坑里的煤的产量增加了百分之五十。这时，“怀疑论者”才如发现了奇迹似地说：“真把煤宣传出来了！”许多原来不相信宣传的力量的人，在无数的事实面前，不得不修正自己的错误的认识，承认：“群众思想通了，啥事都好办，不强迫命令也能完成任务。”然而，这样的现象并不仅仅出现于东北。全国各地，经过了抗美援朝爱国的时事政治宣传，所有征粮、收税、土地改革、镇压反革命、增加生产等一切工作，不是都比从前更好推行和完成了吗？
    对于实施宣传员制度的另一种流行的怀疑意见是：“工作任务太多，忙不过来”；或者说：“搞宣传要影响中心工作”，“建立宣传网与当前各项紧急任务有矛盾”。这些同志是把宣传工作看成了孤立的抽象的工作了，因为把宣传跟其他各项工作割裂开来，所以就看作是一种额外负担。事实上，那一件“中心工作”、“紧急任务”可以离开宣传呢？任何把宣传工作和其他各项工作对立起来的想法是不对的。从来没有也不应当有什么孤立的宣传工作。党的宣传工作的一部分是为党的理论，为党的总纲领、总路线服务的，这一部分可以称为教育工作；而党的日常宣传工作或鼓动工作，就正是为党的各项“中心工作”，“紧急任务”服务的。把宣传工作和实际工作相分离，因而借口实际工作忙而取消了宣传工作，正是目前党的中下级组织所以缺乏经常的宣传工作，所以在工作中常犯官僚主义命令主义错误的重要原因。党中央在关于建立宣传网的决定中明确地指出：“宣传员的任务，是在党的组织的领导之下，经常向自己周围的人民群众用简单通俗的形式进行关于国内外时事，党和人民政府的政策，人民群众的任务特别是当时当地的直接任务，以及人民群众在生产劳动和其他工作中的模范经验的宣传解释，批驳各种反动谣言及在人民群众中流传的错误思想，鼓动人民群众学习模范经验，积极完成任务，并经常将人民群众中的情况向党的组织报告，以便帮助党的组织决定各个时期的适当的宣传内容和宣传方法。”所以，发展宣传员工作，不但不应当妨碍各项紧急任务和中心工作，而且就应当在这些任务和工作的进行中去发展，而且应当领导宣传员来推动各项任务和工作的前进，使它们更能顺利地完成。宣传工作只有与当时当地的具体任务和工作结合才能做好，而各项任务和工作也必须依靠宣传的方法，才能避免依靠强迫命令方法、脱离群众的错误。
    现在我们各地工作同志的确任务很多，工作很忙。这是因为我们的国家今天所处的环境，的确有很多事情，要求党、政府和人民来做。但有些机关和有些同志的工作所以忙乱，还有一个重要原因，就是他们的工作方法不对。他们往往用脱离群众、包办代替、强迫命令的方法去进行工作，而不善于启发群众的政治自觉，发扬群众的积极性和创造性，动员广大群众来共同工作。这样，就常使自己忙得要命，而工作还是做得不好。因此，越是工作多，工作忙，就越应该进行宣传，努力发动群众。而为了使宣传工作经常化、普遍化、系统化，又必须建立宣传网，除此以外，别无妙法。东北和其他地方的经验都一再证明：“有了宣传员，工作好做得多，过去是几个人忙，现在是大家来做了。”这就是说，把宣传队伍建立好，不但不会增加“忙”，倒可以减少领导人的“忙”哩！
    还有一种不很公开的怀疑宣传员工作的意见说：“群众并不需要经常的宣传。向群众宣传得越多，群众的问题越多，麻烦也就越多了。”这种意见，简直是一种反人民反民主的意见。请看看斯大林对于这种人是怎么说的吧！斯大林在一九二五年五月九日在莫斯科党组织积极分子会议上的报告中说：
    “我们中间有些做领导工作的人，时常是发号施令以了事，这当然是要容易得多，简单得多。然而不是一切简单而容易的事都是好的。不久以前有一个镇委书记答复省委代表所提出的该镇缺乏报纸的问题，他说：‘我们何必要报纸呢？没有报纸，倒还安静和妥当些，不然农民们一经阅报，他们又要质问一切，麻烦极了。’这个书记也称为共产主义者哩！实在不待证明，这不是共产主义者，而是一个不幸的东西罢了。同志们，事实上现在要实行领导，非有‘麻烦’不可，若没有报纸，那就更是不行。倘若我们想保持党和苏维埃政权在乡村中的领导，就必须了解和领会这个简单的道理。”（见《列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设》上册五四九页）
    “要实行领导非有‘麻烦’不可”，这句话和毛泽东同志所常说的“革命即麻烦之别名”的意思一样，这个思想是应该深深地领会的。对人民群众宣传时事政策和工作任务，是否会反而增加“麻烦”呢？“麻烦”可能会增加一些，那是因为你的工作没有做好，群众不懂得你所说的道理，或者不相信你说的话是正确的。那就需要继续进行宣传。不宣传，“麻烦”就会更大。群众知道的事情少，也许会少向你“质问”，但他们也就会离开你，不相信你，而去相信反革命谣言了。所以，如果想避免麻烦，一定会更麻烦。只有把道理向群众说清楚，使党的思想政策为群众所掌握，才能真正减少麻烦。东北和其他地方的经验都证明：凡是宣传工作做好的地方，群众了解了时事、政策和任务，摸了底，有了数，懂得为什么要这么办，他们便紧张地动作起来，谣言为之绝迹，麻烦就少得多了。
    最后，还有一些同志说：“好吧，既然一定要建立宣传网，那么就交给宣传部去办吧。”他们把党的宣传工作看作是少数宣传部门工作人员的事。不行的，宣传工作是全党的事，决不是少数人的事。我们党的党章关于党员的义务一条中，明白地规定党员应该“为人民群众服务，巩固党与人民群众的联系，了解并及时反映人民群众的需要，向人民群众解释党的政策”。特别是在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网这样的大事，决不能仅仅依靠宣传部少数工作同志去干，而必须由党委和党的主要负责人亲自动手领导。宣传部在党委的领导下，应该负责对于宣传工作的日常的管理和指导，但工作是否做好主要还决定于党委的领导。东北和其他地方的经验告诉我们：凡是党委重视宣传工作，并建立了对宣传工作的经常的有系统的领导制度的，工作就做得好。反之，工作就做得不好。现在有些地方的党委，在接到党中央关于建立宣传网的决定后，只是交给宣传部办理，既不在党的委员会上认真地讨论，也并无切实的计划、布置和检查。这样是决不会把工作做好的。
    党中央在建立宣传网的决定中指出：“各省、市的党的委员会应当按照当地情况，定出半年内实施本决定的具体计划，报告所属的各中央局批准，并定期检查执行状况，以求如期实现。”当然，中央在这里所说的“按照当地情况，定出在半年内实施本决定的具体计划”，并不是要求在半年内在全国城乡普遍建立宣传网的意思，而是要求各地区定出在当地情况所许可的半年工作计划的意思。特别是在没有大量发展党组织的新区，中央的决定不是着重组织党的宣传网，而是“着重组织适当形式的非党宣传网”。但是这一切决不应当成为松懈全党努力的借口。在全国一切党组织比较健全的城市、农村、工矿区和机关、学校，都应当在今年半年内超过东北在去年半年内试办宣传网的成绩。东北去年既没有中央的决定，也没有现成的经验，而且主要的工作也只在去年的最后两三个月，所以今年其他地区的成绩如果赶不上去年的东北，就是完全没有理由的了。因此，凡在一切有条件的地方，各级党委，都应当按照中央决定，学习东北经验，在目前的抗美援朝工作，发展生产工作，加强工会工作，镇压反革命工作，和其他各项重要工作中，首先有重点地，然后大规模地，把宣传网认真建立起来！
