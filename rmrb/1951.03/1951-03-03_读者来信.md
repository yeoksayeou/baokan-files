　　　　　Blind Allocation of Overstocked Materials by State-Owned Trading Departments in Pingyuan Province
　　Due to a lack of investigation and research into the needs of the masses, and unplanned allocation of materials, coupled with a lack of close communication between lower levels and departments, the state-owned trading departments in Pingyuan Province have created a serious situation where the supply and demand of materials are mismatched, resulting in long-term stockpiles, untimely sales, inflexible capital turnover, and repeated transportation, leading to increased costs. The Heze Department Store Branch had a stockpile of 30,000 jin of Sichuan sugar that could not be sold, yet another 30,000 jin were transferred there. The Anyang and Xiangxi branches of the Grain Company imported one million jin of corn from the Northeast last year, but because it did not meet the needs of the masses, it was eventually sold to the distillery for winemaking. In terms of material allocation, unplanned transfers often occurred, resulting in a waste of transportation costs. According to the Salt Company's statistics alone, unplanned allocations between Xinxiang and Anyang resulted in a waste of over 5.8 million yuan in train fares in three months. In addition, there were also instances of untimely allocation and sales. For example, in April of last year, the Cotton Yarn Company requested the district company to allocate grey cloth for use by various agencies to make uniforms, but it was not allocated until May. As the season had passed, more than 6,000 bolts remain in storage. A reader

　　Editor's Note: The serious situation caused by the lack of investigation and research and the blind allocation of materials by the state-owned trading departments in Pingyuan Province should be taken seriously by all economic departments. The Trade Department of Pingyuan Province should conduct a thorough inspection.
　　"Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" is a Powerful Guarantee for Building a New China
Editor:
　　After seeing the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government on February 21st, and the People's Daily editorial "Why Counterrevolutionaries Must Be Resolutely Suppressed" on February 22nd, I felt that this was a major event. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have turned over, and the people of the whole country have the conditions to build their own beautiful life; and these conditions are the result of the bloodshed and sacrifice and long-term struggle of countless martyrs. We will never allow incorrigible counterrevolutionaries to engage in sabotage and destruction again. I am a railway worker, and I would like to cite two examples from the railway to arouse everyone's vigilance and further recognize the faces of counterrevolutionaries.
　　Zhang Dianyuan, the chief of the inspection section of a railway vehicle factory in Northeast China, was a counterrevolutionary element who had been a landlord and participated in the Kuomintang reactionary organization. He used his position to cleverly sabotage production, causing a total loss of state property worth more than 16 billion Northeast yuan. His tricks were: deliberately casting broken parts on locomotives, so that the repaired locomotives still needed to be repaired again, a total of twelve locomotives; on the other hand, he deliberately transferred skilled technicians away, using personnel who did not understand technology to do important steel wheel inspection work, or deliberately delaying and not carrying out inspections according to the standards indicated by higher authorities, so that many steel wheels became waste products because they did not meet the standards. In this way, the hard-earned production results of the workers were destroyed by this counterrevolutionary element with invisible and malicious tricks.
　　In October 1949, when the US-Chiang planes bombed the Shanghai-Nanjing area, the workers of a railway factory bravely rescued locomotives and vehicles. But the special agents Zhou Laisheng, Liang Guohua, etc., who were lurking in the factory, took the opportunity to set fire to and destroy the vehicles. The state property that the workers risked their lives to rescue from under the enemy's bombs was destroyed by these counterrevolutionary elements.
　　Of course, the several counterrevolutionary elements mentioned above have been severely punished by the government. But this can fully illustrate that incorrigible counterrevolutionary elements are insidious and are the mortal enemies of the people; if we do not raise our vigilance against them and do not suppress them, the property of the state and the people may be destroyed by them at any time. The "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government is a powerful guarantee for the construction of a new China.

            平原省国营贸易部门盲目调拨积压物资
    平原省国营贸易部门因对群众需求缺乏调查研究，物资调拨无计划，再加上下级与部门间联系不密切，致使物资供求不相适应，造成长期积压物资，销售失时，资金周转不灵及反复调运，成本增高的严重现象。菏泽百货公司支公司库存川糖三万斤，售销不了，却又调去了三万斤。粮食公司安阳、湘西分公司，去年曾由东北调入玉米一百万斤，因不合群众需要，最后只得售给酒业公司作酒。在物资调拨方面，亦因无计划，常常发生物资旅行现象，浪费运费很大。仅据盐业公司统计，因调拨无计划，新乡、安阳间的火车运费，在三个月中就浪费了五百八十余万元之多。此外，调拨不及时及销售失时的现象也存在，如去年四月，花纱布公司请区公司拨运灰布供各机关作制服用，直到五月才拨来，由于季节已过，至今尚存六千余匹。 一读者
       编者按：平原国营贸易部门由于缺乏调查研究，盲目调拨物资所造成的严重现象，应引起一切经济部门的重视。平原省贸易部应认真进行检查。
        “中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”是建设新中国的有力保障编辑同志：
    看到二月二十一日中央人民政府公布了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”和人民日报二月二十二日社论“为什么必须坚决镇压反革命”后，我感到这是当前的一件大事。在共产党领导下，中国人民翻身了，全国人民有条件来建设自己的美好生活；而这种条件，是无数先烈流血牺牲、长期斗争的结果。我们是绝不容许怙恶不悛的反革命分子再来从事暗害与破坏的。我是一个铁路职工，在读到社论中所引斯大林同志的指示：“……为要建筑大的铁路桥梁，需要数千人，但要炸毁这个桥梁，却只需要几个人就够了。……”对的，反革命分子的暗害与破坏伎俩是多而恶毒的，我愿举铁路上的两个实例，来引起大家的高度警惕，并进一步来认识反革命分子的面貌。
    东北某铁路车辆工厂检查科长张殿元，是一个被斗地主及参加过国民党反动组织的反革命分子。他利用职务上的便利，很巧妙地来破坏生产，使国家财产前后损失共值东北币一百六十余亿元。他的伎俩是：把机车的车辆故意铸破，使修好的机车仍需重新修，这样共有十二台机车；另一方面他故意把熟练的技术人员调开，以不懂技术的人员来做重要的钢轮检查工作，或故意拖延及不根据上级所指示的标准进行检验，使很多钢轮因不合标准而成废品。这样，工人们辛辛苦苦的生产成果，却被这种反革命分子以无形的、恶毒的伎俩毁于一旦。
    一九四九年十月，美蒋飞机轰炸京沪一带时，某铁路工厂的工人们曾英勇的抢救机车车辆。但潜伏在该厂的特务周来生、梁国华等却乘机纵火烧毁车辆。工人们冒着生命危险在敌人炸弹下抢救出来的国家财产，就被这些反革命分子所毁坏。
    当然，上面所说的几个反革命分子都已被政府严惩了。但这可以充分说明：怙恶不悛的反革命分子是阴毒的，他们是人民的死敌；如果我们对他们不提高警惕，不镇压他们，国家、人民的财产都随时有遭受他们破坏的可能。中央人民政府公布的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》，对新中国的建设事业是一个有力保障。
