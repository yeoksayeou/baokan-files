The Northwest District's party and government leading organs are now universally launching a movement to improve leadership style, and the Civil Affairs Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee has provided a good example. The department has dispatched a large number of its organ cadres to the grassroots to participate in practical work, understand the situation, conduct typical experiments, and then propose methods, promote good experiences, and promptly correct deviations in work, so that policies can be correctly implemented. In the past year, the department has used this leadership method to coordinate with relevant organs to solve many major issues related to the interests of millions of people, timely correct some incorrect understandings of lower-level organs, and effectively overcome bureaucracy and commandism in some work.

The department was established in January last year. Because most cadres were not familiar with the situation in the new district, and the Northwest region was vast, with incomplete administrative structures at all levels, many tasks assigned were often not completed satisfactorily. The department leaders studied this situation and believed that only by sending a large number of organ cadres to the grassroots to mobilize the masses could the various tasks be successfully completed. Therefore, when governments in various parts of the Northwest generally reported serious disasters last spring and requested higher authorities to allocate grain for disaster relief, the department sent a large number of cadres, in coordination with relevant departments, to conduct investigations in various places. The investigation revealed that, except for a few areas such as southern Shaanxi, Dali County in Shaanxi Province, and Linxia in Gansu Province, where the disasters were relatively serious, the disasters in other areas were relatively mild. Based on the actual situation, the people's government provided grain relief to the areas with more serious disasters, and in the other areas, it organized the masses to engage in production for self-salvation. As a result, all areas safely survived the spring famine.

After the National Civil Affairs Conference concluded last August, the department dispatched cadres to various provinces in the Northwest to help convene provincial civil affairs conferences, promptly and universally conveying the spirit of the National Civil Affairs Conference to the counties, laying a good foundation for the entire civil affairs work in the future. In addition, the department successively dispatched cadres to assist Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces in convening people's representative conferences of all circles, and further sent working groups to Chang'an and Xianyang in Shaanxi Province, Linxia, Dingxi, and Xiji in Gansu Province, and Minhe and Xining in Qinghai Province to assist in relevant work related to people's representative conferences of all circles. In assisting various localities, the working groups conducted inspections, promptly corrected deviations in work, and promoted good work experiences, enabling cadres in various localities to have a relatively clear understanding of the fundamental nature of the people's regime, the content of the people's democratic united front, and especially the combination of people's representative conferences of all circles with current tasks. Currently, except for a few pastoral areas in the Northwest, people's representative conferences have been held from one to seven times, powerfully promoting various construction tasks.

In improving leadership methods, the Northwest Civil Affairs Department has also adopted the method of selecting typical areas, conducting experiments, and then promoting them. Last autumn, the department selected Yuzhong County in Gansu Province as a typical area and sent cadres to coordinate with the local government to conduct preferential treatment work on a trial basis. Due to the launch of a mutual aid and mutual assistance movement, the grain and other materials voluntarily donated by the local people not only solved the living difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers in the entire county but also had a surplus of more than 300 shi of grain. This example powerfully changed the erroneous view of some local cadres that preferential treatment work could only be done well if the government provided a large amount of grain.

In the six months after the rectification campaign last year, cadres sent to the countryside by the Northwest Civil Affairs Department accounted for 69 percent of the total number of cadres in the department. The five departments under the department sent cadres to the countryside 46 times, with each working group working in the countryside for an average of 118 days. The result of the department's rotation of cadres not only promoted the work in various places but also improved the efficiency of handling routine internal work in the department, even though the number of personnel was reduced, due to practical experience and familiarity with the situation. For example, the speed of processing incoming and outgoing documents has generally increased by about one-half compared to the past.

### 西北民政部提供良好范例  派遣大批干部深入下层，推动了各项工作

　　西北民政部提供良好范例
    派遣大批干部深入下层，推动了各项工作
    西北区各级党政领导机关现正普遍展开改进领导作风运动，西北军政委员会民政部已提供了良好的范例。该部派遣了大批机关干部到下层去参加实际工作，了解情况，进行典型试验，从而提出办法，推广良好经验，并及时纠正工作中的偏向，使政策得以正确执行。在过去一年中，该部曾运用这一领导方法，协同有关机关解决了许多关系千万群众利益的大事，及时纠正了下级机关若干不正确的认识，有效地克服了某些工作中的官僚主义和命令主义。
    该部于去年一月间建立。由于一般干部对新区情况不熟悉，再加西北地区辽阔，各级行政机构还不够健全，因此许多工作布置下去，往往不能圆满完成。该部领导人研究了这一情况，认为只有把机关干部大批派到下层去发动群众，才能胜利地完成各项任务。于是，当去春西北各地政府普报灾情严重，纷纷要求上级拨发粮食救灾时，该部即派出大批干部，协同有关部门深入各地进行调查。调查结果：除陕南，陕西省大荔县和甘肃省临夏等少数地区灾情较重外，其余地区灾情都较轻。人民政府根据实际情况，对灾情较重的地区发放粮食救济，在其余地区就组织群众生产自救，结果各地都安然度过了春荒。
    去年八月，全国民政会议闭幕以后，该部又分派干部赴西北各省帮助召开了省的民政会议，将全国民政会议的精神及时而普遍地传达到县，为以后整个民政工作打下了良好的基础。此外，该部又先后派出干部协助甘肃、青海等省召开各界人民代表会议，并进一步派工作组到陕西省长安、咸阳，甘肃省临夏、定西、西吉，青海省民和、西宁等市、县，协助进行有关各界人民代表会议的工作。工作组在协助各地工作中，进行了检查，及时纠正了工作偏向，推广了好的工作经验，使各地干部对人民政权的根本性质、人民民主统一战线的内容，特别是各界人民代表会议与当前任务的结合问题，有了比较明确的认识。现西北各地除少数游牧区外，均已开过一次到七次人民代表会议，有力地推动了各项建设工作。
    在改进领导方法上，西北民政部又采用了选择典型地区，进行试验，然后推广的办法。去年秋后该部选择甘肃省榆中县为典型区，派干部协同当地政府试办优抚工作。由于发动了互济互助运动，当地人民群众自动捐出的粮食和其他物资，除解决了全县革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命工作人员家属的生活困难外，尚余粮食三百多石。这一例证，有力地改变了某些地方干部认为只有政府拿出大批粮食才能作好优抚工作的错误观点。
    西北民政部在去年整风以后半年中，下乡干部占全部干部总数的百分之六十九，该部所属五个部门干部分别下乡四十六次，平均每个工作组在乡间工作一百一十八天。该部轮流派出干部的结果，不仅推进了各地的工作，并且在处理机关内部日常工作上，由于有了实际经验和熟悉了情况，人员虽减少但工作效率反而提高。如处理往来公文的速度，一般已较前提高二分之一左右。
