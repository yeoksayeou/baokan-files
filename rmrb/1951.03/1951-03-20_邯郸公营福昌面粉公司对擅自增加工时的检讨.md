    Handan Publicly Operated Fuchang Flour Company's Self-Criticism Regarding Unauthorized Increase in Working Hours

To the Editors:

    After seeing Comrade Wang Liguo's criticism of our factory's unauthorized increase in working hours in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on January 31st, we immediately conducted a self-examination and requested our superiors to retroactively pay the workers for the increased working hours. We originally intended to make a public self-criticism in the newspaper after the retroactive payment of wages, which has led to this delay. In addition to apologizing to the newspaper and readers, we now offer the following self-criticism:

    In order to speed up construction and restore production as soon as possible, our factory convened a factory management committee meeting on October 10th last year (attended by the factory director, union chairman, Party branch secretary, and others). At the meeting, it was decided to change the past eight-hour workday to ten hours. At the general staff meeting held on October 15th, the factory director announced the management committee's decision to increase working hours and solicited everyone's opinions (it was not explicitly stated at the time that wages would not be increased after the change to a ten-hour work system). No one raised any other opinions at the time. Due to our leadership's bureaucracy, we believed that this constituted approval. At the same time, because we usually do not pay attention to government laws and regulations, we did not submit a request for government approval and proceeded to implement the change without authorization. Afterwards, we also failed to deeply understand the workers' opinions on this issue. In addition, although we convened a management committee meeting and a general meeting on this issue of increasing working hours, which directly affected the vital interests of all factory workers, we did not give the workers sufficient opportunity to deliberate beforehand. This also shows that our democratic style is insufficient. In the future, we are willing to correct these mistakes under the supervision of the workers.

    邯郸公营福昌面粉公司对擅自增加工时的检讨编辑同志：
    在一月三十一日贵报《读者来信》栏看到王利国同志对本厂擅自增加工时的批评后，我们即一面进行检讨，一面呈请上级补发给工人增加工时的工资。我们原拟待补发工资后，一并在报上公开检讨，以致拖延至今。我们除向报社及读者致歉外，现并作以下检讨：
    本厂为加紧修建，以便早日恢复生产。在去年十月十日召开的工厂管理委员会上（参加者有厂长、工会主任、党支部书记等人），决定将过去八小时工作改为十小时。在十月十五日召开的全体职工大会上，由厂长宣布管理委员会增加工时的决议，并征求大家意见（当时并未明确提出改为十小时工作制后，不加发工资。）当场并没有人提出其他意见。由于我们领导上的官僚主义，认为这样便算是通过了。同时，由于我们平常不注意政府法令，以致未呈请政府批准，即擅自执行。以后也未深入了解工人对此问题的意见。另外，我们对这一关系全厂工人切身利益的增加工时问题，虽然召开了管理委员会及全体大会，但事前并未给予工人充分酝酿的机会。这也说明我们的民主作风很不够。今后我们愿在工人的监督之下，纠正这些错误。
