　　War Song on the South Bank of the Jinjiang River
      Li Zhuang, Chao Qi
    The Unyielding People
    Last October, an evil wind blew from the west coast. The elderly, children, and women of Korea stood in front of their thatched cottages with tears in their eyes, reluctantly bidding farewell to the Korean People's Army, which was temporarily withdrawing north. At this time, people were walking hurriedly and nervously, all eager to get to their destination as soon as possible. A young woman who had previously worked in an office in Geumcheon, carrying a small bag, walked quickly east along the 38th parallel. She was going to Mount Odae to join the guerrillas.
    This young woman's name was Hwang Kyung-soon, 22 years old, and she lived in Sikpo-ri, Geumcheon County, Hwanghae Province. This was a small mountain village, five miles north of the 38th parallel. She was an only daughter and much loved by her grandmother. Her father, Hwang In-soo, was a famous anti-Japanese fighter who continued to work underground for the revolution in South Korea after the "August 15th" liberation. Therefore, she and her grandmother moved to Gaeseong, south of the 38th parallel, and she attended a middle school there. Later, the Lee Seung-man gang, under the direction of its American masters, created a 20-mile no-man's land on the 38th parallel, and the people were driven out of their homes and wandered everywhere. Students could not concentrate on their studies, and Hwang Kyung-soon was forced to return to her home with her grandmother. In the spring of the year before last, the Lee Seung-man gang bombarded North Korea with artillery, leveling her home. Hwang Kyung-soon had to bid farewell to her grandmother and mother and work as a teacher at Haeju People's Elementary School. Later, she transferred to Geumcheon, near Gaeseong, to work for the Women's Alliance and the Democratic Youth Alliance. At the end of September last year, American soldiers occupied Seoul, and the People's Army temporarily withdrew north. Hwang Kyung-soon, like all Koreans, knew that the decisive battle had come, so on the evening of the end of September, she bid farewell to her grandmother and mother for the second time and set out with four companions to advance to Mount Odae.
    They often encountered enemies along the way, but continued to advance by detours. At the end of October, they finally found the guerrilla force.
    This guerrilla force consisted of several thousand people. Its predecessor was the Seoul Special Self-Defense Force, which had been transferred during the defense of Seoul. Initially, it consisted of only two hundred people, all outstanding workers, students, and cadres. The Special Self-Defense Force fought the enemy for a month, growing stronger and stronger. Peasants from Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province, who had been emancipated, joined in tens and hundreds. Like Hwang Kyung-soon, they had suffered all kinds of oppression for a long time, and they were all unyielding people.
    The leading cadres of the guerrilla force were revolutionaries who had been battle-tested for a long time. The detachment leader was the commander of the defense of Seoul, and he had started revolutionary work in Seoul twenty-one years ago. He had been arrested several times, and was only released after Japan surrendered. The battalion commanders were all guerrilla heroes from Taebaek Mountain, Jirisan Mountain, Ilwol Mountain, and Boseon Mountain. Such a team and such leadership guaranteed that it would never be defeated.
  The Fighting November
    Korean winters are very cold, and the mountain peaks are covered with silver snow. The People's Guerrilla Army often took advantage of the snowy nights, which the enemy particularly dreaded, to attack the enemy everywhere.
    In this guerrilla force, there was a company called the "Bangsangdong Guerrilla Team," which consisted of more than seventy members, all from Bangsangdong. The "Bangsangdong Guerrilla Team" lived in a small village ten miles away from Maengsan, surrounded by high mountains, with a canyon leading to Maengsan. On the night of November 21, American soldiers stationed in Maengsan, taking advantage of the hazy moonlight, ambushed this small village. The "Bangsangdong Guerrilla Team" knew about it beforehand. The guerrillas were ambushed on both sides of the canyon. At midnight, more than forty American soldiers, carrying heavy automatic weapons, walked slowly. When they reached the narrowest part of the canyon, the guerrillas threw grenades from both sides. In just five minutes, all of these robbers were wiped out.
    The guerrillas' victories were not big each time, but the number of times was many, it can be said that victory followed victory. On the night of November 23, one hundred and fifty guerrillas attacked Hiseol-li, seventy miles north of Gapyeong County. Here, the ridges undulated, the terrain was complex, and sparse forests grew on the mountain peaks, which was a good battlefield for the guerrillas. A battalion of American soldiers lived in Hiseol-li. The guerrillas sneaked into the village, and the American soldiers did not know it. After a brief battle, some of the American soldiers were captured, some were killed or wounded, and some abandoned their weapons and fled. At the end of December, just as our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were beating the enemy back in retreat, the guerrillas living in Hiseol-li took the opportunity to attack the enemy in Gapyeong County. In this battle, more than 300 puppet soldiers were killed and 30 were captured. The enemy became anxious and immediately mobilized a force far exceeding the guerrillas to launch a frantic counterattack, firing fiercely at the guerrillas with flat-firing guns, mortars, and light and heavy machine guns. The guerrillas repelled three large-scale enemy assaults with submachine guns, rifles, and red-tasseled spears, and held out in Hiseol-li for three days. When the guerrillas were in great danger, our Chinese People's Volunteers arrived in Hiseol-li in time, annihilated the enemy, and victoriously joined forces with the guerrillas.
  Fighting on the South Bank of the Jinjiang River
    With the victorious development of the war, this guerrilla force has advanced into the heart of the enemy. When we were in Seoul, we often heard good news from the front: guerrillas were destroying enemy transportation; attacking enemy transport vehicles; and threatening the enemy everywhere. These guerrillas are no longer scattered small units, but organized combat groups. The guerrillas are like a radiant constellation of the Big Dipper, illuminating the suffering people in the enemy-occupied areas. This suffering is coming to an end, and the guerrillas are singing the voice of the people's victory in the mountains and forests on the south bank of the Jinjiang River:
     "On the storm-beaten hills in the deep night,
     We await the rising sun at dawn.
     The banner of victory flutters in the flames of war,
     We sing of our glorious victory.
     Although tired in the bloody struggle,
     The flame in our hearts burns even brighter.
     Raise our swords and guns, respond to the leader's call;
     Fight bravely, unyielding for the motherland.
     Use all our strength to defeat American imperialism,
     Use all our strength to strive for independence.
     The banner of victory flutters in the flames of war,
    We sing of our glorious victory."
            January 29th, in Korea

　　锦江南岸的战歌
      李庄　超琪
    不屈服的人们
    去年十月，一股恶风从西海岸吹来。朝鲜的老年人、小孩和妇女，含着眼泪，站在茅屋门前，依依不舍地送别暂时北撤的人民军。这时候，人们匆忙而紧张地走着，都急于及早赶到自己要去的地方。一个原来在金川某机关工作的女青年，背着一个小小的行李包，急促地沿三八线往东走。她要赶到五台山，参加游击队。
    这个女青年名叫黄庆顺，二十二岁，家住黄海道金川郡食浦里。这是一个小小的山村，在三八线北五里。她是个独生女儿，很受祖母钟爱。父亲黄寅秀，是个有名的抗日战士，“八一五”以后，仍在南朝鲜继续作地下革命工作。因此，她和祖母移居到三八线南的开城，在一个中学里念书。后来，李承晚匪帮在其美国主子指使下，在三八线上制造了二十里的无人区，人民被逐出自己的家，到处流浪。学生不能安心读书了，黄庆顺被迫随着祖母回到自己家里。前年春天，李承晚匪帮用大炮轰击北朝鲜，把她的家毁平了。黄庆顺不得不辞别祖母和母亲，到海州人民小学当教员。以后，又转到开城附近的金川作女性同盟和民主青年同盟的工作。去年九月末，美国兵占领汉城，人民军暂时北撤。黄庆顺和所有的朝鲜人一样，知道决斗的时候来到了，于是在九月末的一个晚上，第二次告别了祖母和母亲，和四个同伴出发，向五台山前进。
    她们一路常遇着敌人，但是继续绕路前进。十月末，她们终找到了游击队。
    这支游击队共有数千人。它的前身是进行汉城保卫战时转移出来的汉城特别自卫队。最初不过二百余人，全是优秀的工人、学生和干部。特别自卫队和敌人打了一个月，越打越壮大，京畿道和江原道的翻身农民，成十成百地参加进来。他们都和黄庆顺一样，长期地遭受各种各样的压迫，他们都是不屈服的人。
    游击队的领导干部都是久经战斗的革命者。支队长是汉城保卫战的指挥者，二十一年前，他就在汉城开始了革命工作。他曾几次被捕，最后一次是在日本投降后才出狱的。各营营长都是太白山、智异山、日月山、普仙山的游击英雄。这样的队伍和这样的领导，保证了它永远不可被战胜。
  战斗的十一月
    朝鲜冬天很冷，山头积雪如银。人民游击队时常利用敌人特别头痛的雪夜，到处袭击敌人。
    这支游击队里有个叫做“防山洞游击队”的连队，七十多个队员，都是防山洞人。“防山洞游击队”住在离孟山十里的一个小村里，四面高山环抱，有一道峡谷通到孟山。十一月二十一日夜晚，驻在孟山的美国兵，乘着朦胧月色，偷袭这个小村。事先被“防山洞游击队”知道了。游击队埋伏在峡谷的两旁。午夜时分，四十多个美国兵，带着笨重的自动火器，慢吞吞地走来。等他们走到峡谷最狭处，游击队就从两旁掷出了手榴弹。不过五分钟，这批强盗全部被歼灭了。
    游击队每次的胜利是不大的，但次数是多的，可以说，那是胜利接着胜利。十一月二十三日夜晚，一百五十个游击队员袭击加平郡北面七十里的喜雪里。这里岗峦起伏，地形复杂，山头上疏疏落落地长着一些树林，是游击队的好战场。喜雪里住着一营美国兵。游击队摸进村庄，美国兵还不知道，经过短暂的战斗，美国兵有的被俘，有的伤亡，有的丢掉武器逃跑了。十二月底，正当我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军把敌人打得节节败退的时候，住在喜雪里的游击队乘机袭击加平郡的敌人。在这次战斗中，击毙伪军三百余人，俘三十人。敌人急了，立即调动远远超过游击队的兵力疯狂反扑，以平射炮、迫击炮、轻、重机枪向游击队猛烈射击。游击队以冲锋枪、步枪和红缨枪击退敌人三次大规模的冲锋，在喜雪里坚持了三天。我国人民志愿军在游击队十分危急的时候，适时赶到喜雪里，歼灭了敌人，和游击队胜利会师。
  战斗在锦江南岸
    随着战争的胜利发展，这支游击队又推进到敌人的心脏里去了。我们在汉城的时候，经常听到前方传来的捷报：游击队破坏敌人的交通；袭击敌人的运输车；到处威胁着敌人。这些游击队，现在已经不是零星的小部队，而是有组织的战斗集团了。游击队正像光芒四射的北斗星，照耀着敌占区饱受苦难的人民。这种苦难已近完结了，游击队在锦江南岸的山林里，纵情地唱出人民的胜利的声音：
     “在深夜里暴风雨吹打的山岗上，
     我们等待黎明时上升的太阳。
     在烽火中胜利的旗帜飘荡，
     我们歌唱我们的胜利辉煌。
     在血腥的斗争里虽然疲劳，
     我们胸中的火焰却更加燃烧。
     高举刀枪，响应领袖的号召；
     英勇斗争，为祖国不屈不挠。
     用一切力量打垮美帝，
     用一切力量争取独立。
     在烽火中胜利的旗帜飘荡，
    我们歌唱我们的胜利辉煌。”
            一月二十九日，于朝鲜
