Chairman, Premier:

    I hereby submit a report on the participation of representatives of all nationalities in National Day for your instruction.

    (1) A total of 159 representatives of fraternal nationalities and 222 members of performing arts troupes were invited by Premier Zhou of the Central People's Government Administration Council to come to Beijing to participate in National Day. The representatives included military and government personnel at all levels, workers, farmers, herdsmen, hunters, model laborers, family members of revolutionary soldiers, family members of revolutionary martyrs, teachers, students, literary and art workers, Living Buddhas, princes, Ahongs, Kanbus, Lamas, Tusi, and headmen.

    (2) Before coming to Beijing, most representatives had four wishes: (1) to participate in the National Day ceremony, see Chairman Mao, and pay respects to Chairman Mao; (2) to present the situation and hopes of their own nationality to the Central Government; (3) to unite all nationalities in the country and listen to the instructions of the Central Government; (4) to visit the capital and see the actual situation of the new China and its attitude towards minority nationalities in all aspects. Due to the influence of Han chauvinism in history, some representatives and performing arts troupe members inevitably harbored many concerns and doubts. Some representatives of border nationalities even dared to come only after being guaranteed by local people. However, after only a few days in Beijing, those who were hesitant to come expressed to others: "I am lucky to have come!" In total, the representatives and performing arts troupes spent a month in Beijing, and their mood was always pleasant and high-spirited. They generally believed that their wishes for participating in National Day had been fulfilled, and everything exceeded their expectations. Many things had never been seen or heard before, or even thought of. Therefore, the general reflection was that the impression was deep, the emotion was great, and the harvest was rich. When leaving Beijing, there were two emotions at the same time: on the one hand, "reluctance to leave Chairman Mao, reluctance to leave Beijing, reluctance to leave the working comrades," and many people could not help but shed tears when saying goodbye; on the other hand, they were eager to go back and "tell their own nationality what they had personally experienced, seen, and heard as soon as possible."

    First of all, they deeply realized the greatness of Chairman Mao. When they saw the people's love and cheers for Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's cordial response to the people during National Day, many people were moved to tears. Representatives from the Southwest said: "This is the real leader." A Uygur representative from Xinjiang said: "The country, the leader, and the army belong to all nationalities." A Li representative from Hainan Island vowed: "We will always follow the Communist Party and advance under the banner of Mao Zedong!" A Sala representative from Qinghai said: "It seems that Chairman Mao is like the Ziwei star in the sky, and everyone revolves around him." Almost all representatives from Central and South China vowed: "We will definitely convey Chairman Mao's concern to our own nationality when we go back, and we must redouble our efforts in work and study." A Tibetan representative from the Southwest was seriously ill, but he insisted on participating in the presentation to Chairman Mao on October 3. He refused to listen to dissuasion and said: "I am willing to give my body to Chairman Mao."

    Many representatives had never imagined that the motherland would be so great, so vast, and so rich in resources. On the way to Beijing, seeing the crops on the vast and fertile fields, many people were filled with envy. After arriving in Beijing, they saw factories, schools, hospitals, and various progressive undertakings, and they deeply believed that the future was infinitely bright. Especially when they saw the strong and majestic People's Liberation Army and its equipment during National Day, everyone was extremely excited and said: "We are no longer afraid of anyone daring to bully us!"

    "The Kuomintang was all fake to us, but this time everything is real from top to bottom." "Chairman Mao, the central leaders, and comrades from all departments, guesthouses, factories, and schools... all respect and treat us so kindly." Some representatives who had also been invited and entertained by the Kuomintang government in the past felt this even more deeply. The representatives and members of the performing arts troupes firmly believed that in the big family of the People's Republic of China, all nationalities have a bright future. Therefore, the mutual visits of representatives of various nationalities became even more intimate.

    The reports by the heads of the Nationalities Affairs Commission on the central government's nationality policy and the introduction to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also achieved the desired effect.

    The month-long activities of representatives of various nationalities and performing arts troupes in the capital enabled all participating cadres to have a deeper understanding of the central government's nationality policy in terms of ideology and emotion. The joint performances of the performing arts troupes of various nationalities totaled sixteen times, and separate performances totaled seven times, with audiences including personnel from government agencies, the military, workers, students, and citizens reaching 100,000, which had a wide and profound impact. It played an educational role in nationality policy for the audience, inspired national self-esteem among minority nationalities, and achieved the effect of mutual observation and learning among literary and art workers of various nationalities.

    The great motherland, the great national unity and national family, and the great leader Chairman Mao, do not allow imperialist aggression. When they saw the People's Daily's announcement of the US imperialists' conspiracy and provocation to invade China, it immediately aroused lofty indignation. At the initiative of the Southwest representatives, every representative signed the joint statement against US aggression and aid to Korea. In addition, broadcasts were made in various ethnic languages.

    The political and spiritual gains of this National Day participation in Beijing by representatives of various nationalities and performing arts troupes are immeasurable.

    (3) In conversations and visits with representatives of various nationalities, we have gained some understanding of the situation and demands of various nationalities. The materials on the national situation will be sorted out separately. The demands mainly include the following:

    (1) Regional autonomy for all nationalities should be implemented as soon as possible. The people's governments at all levels, especially the joint national governments in areas where various nationalities live together, should appropriately increase the number of minority nationality personnel. In the past, some places had too few or did not pay enough attention.

    (2) More national schools should be established and a large number of cadres should be trained. Restore or establish primary and secondary schools for various nationalities. Higher education institutions and secondary schools in the interior should set up public-funded quotas for minority nationality students, and appropriately consider the current cultural level of minority nationality students when applying for exams.

    (3) Use the languages of various nationalities to publish books and newspapers and translate works, and send more people to carry out literary and artistic work in minority nationality areas.

    (4) Provide more health and medical equipment.

    (5) Strengthen trade work, export local products from minority nationality areas, and import daily necessities.

    (6) The central government should send more cadres to minority nationality areas to lead and help with work.

    (7) In the future, we hope to organize more minority nationality people to visit and inspect.

    These requirements are reasonable, in line with the central government's aims, and in line with the nationality work policy pointed out by Premier Zhou in his National Day report. Premier Zhou specifically pointed out that it is necessary to implement regional autonomy in a planned and step-by-step manner and to train a large number of ethnic minority cadres - these two primary tasks.

    (4) Due to the basic victory of the People's Great Revolution and the People's Liberation War throughout the country, and the overthrow of the common enemies of all nationalities, the domestic national relations have undergone fundamental changes, from the relationship of oppression and being oppressed between nationalities to the relationship of equality and mutual assistance. Also, due to the many works done by the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels, the hatred, estrangement, and suspicion between nationalities caused by history, especially the discrimination of the Han nationality against the minority nationalities and the distrust of the minority nationalities against the Han nationality, have also begun to change somewhat. However, this discrimination and distrust, created by a long history, will require a considerable amount of time to eliminate. The problem here is that it is necessary to constantly and carefully correct the tendency of Han chauvinism in the large nationalities based on specific facts, and to correct the tendency of narrow nationalism in the minority nationalities. Each should conduct self-criticism and divide the work to carry out. At present, we should focus on correcting the Han chauvinism tendency among the Han nationality and Han cadres.

    One of the current primary tasks is to implement the policy of national regional autonomy in the Common Program. We are studying and drafting an outline for the implementation of the general principles of national regional autonomy. In view of the fact that the situations of various nationalities are very different and their level of development is very unbalanced, the specific content and specific forms of national regional autonomy will inevitably be different. Therefore, the provisions on the general principles can only be outline-style, and the implementation must be based on local conditions and take necessary preparations and steps.

    Another primary task at present is to universally and extensively train ethnic minority cadres, which is the key to the successful implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and doing all work well in ethnic regions. We have put forward a pilot program for training minority cadres and a pilot program for preparing the Central Nationalities Institute, requesting review and approval for implementation.

    There is a historically created factual inequality in the political, economic, and cultural levels between the Han nationality and various minority nationalities, which requires long-term efforts, including the assistance of the Han nationality, to change. At present, the most urgent needs of all nationalities for help are medicine and health, the exchange of products, and culture and education. We ask the relevant central departments to pay special attention to this, include these tasks in an appropriate position in next year's plan, make the necessary preparations in terms of funding, and consider convening professional meetings in these three areas when conditions are slightly available to promote this work.

    The manpower of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission is extremely inadequate, so the work is also extremely inadequate. This needs to be gradually resolved in order to adapt to the increasingly developing situation of nationality work.

    (5) In concluding the report, it should be mentioned that the cadres who were transferred from all aspects to participate in the reception work this time generally did a good job in nationality relations and completed their tasks. At the same time, from the mouths of representatives of various nationalities, we also know that although a small number of Han cadres working in minority nationality areas have deviated, the vast majority work hard and abide by the policies. Some of the comrades who have deviated have made corrections after criticism and education. The key still lies in correct leadership and timely education from above. It is still necessary to mobilize and encourage appropriate Han cadres to work in minority nationality areas. Those who do not abide by the policies and are unwilling to correct themselves should be recalled, but those who firmly abide by the policies, work hard, and achieve results must be rewarded.

　　中央人民政府民族事务委员会
    关于各民族代表参加国庆节的报告
    （李维汉主任委员在一九五○年十一月二十四日政务院第六十次政务会议上的报告）主席，总理：
    谨提出关于各民族代表参加国庆节的报告，请予指示。
    （一）接受中央人民政府政务院周总理邀请来北京参加国庆节的各兄弟民族代表共一五九人，文工团二二二人。代表成份包括各级军政人员、工人、农人、牧人、猎人、劳动模范、革命军人家属、革命烈士家属、教师、学生、文艺工作者、活佛、王公、阿訇、堪布、喇嘛、土司、头人等。
    （二）来京前，多数代表怀着四个愿望：（１）参加国庆大典，见到毛主席，向毛主席致敬；（２）向中央陈述自己民族的情况和希望；（３）全国各民族大团结，听取中央指示；（４）参观首都，各方面看看新中国实际情况和对少数民族的态度。由于历史上大汉族主义压迫的影响，有些代表和文工团员不免怀着许多顾虑与怀疑。个别边疆民族代表甚至是经过地方人士的担保才敢来的。但是到了北京后的不多日子，曾经迟疑不愿来的人就向别人表示：“我幸而来了！”。计全体代表和文工团在北京一个月，情绪始终是愉快而高涨的，普遍认为此次参加国庆节的愿望都达到了，并且一切都出乎意料。有许多事情又是从来没有见闻过，甚至是没有想到过的。因此，普遍的反映是印象深，感动大，收获多。离北京时同时有两种情绪：一方面“留恋毛主席，留恋北京，留恋工作同志们，”很多人在临别时禁不住落泪；另一方面又急欲回去，“尽快地把自己所亲历、亲见、亲闻告诉本民族。”
    首先是深深地体会到毛主席的伟大，国庆节看到群众对毛主席的热爱欢呼，和毛主席对人民的亲切回答时，很多人感动流泪了。西南代表说：“这才是真正的领袖。”新疆维族代表说：“国家、领袖和军队是各民族的。”海南岛黎族代表立誓说：“永远跟着共产党走，在毛泽东旗帜下前进！”。青海撒拉族代表说：“看来毛主席好比天上的紫微星，大家都跟他转。”几乎全体中南代表都立誓：“回去一定把毛主席的关怀向本民族传达，一定要加倍努力工作和学习。”西南藏族某代表病相当重，但一定要参加十月三日向毛主席的献礼，劝阻不听，他说：“愿意把身子交给毛主席”。
    祖国有这么伟大，这么地大人多，这么物产丰富，也是许多代表从来没有想到的。在来北京途中，看到广大肥美田地上的庄稼，许多人羡慕不置。到北京后，看了工厂，看了学校，看了医院，看了各种进步事业，深信前途无限光明。尤其国庆节日看到了坚强而雄伟的人民解放军及其装备，大家兴奋到极点，说：“再不怕有什么人敢于欺负我们了！”
    “国民党对我们都是假的，这次上上下下都是真的”。“毛主席，中央首长，各机关、招待所、工厂、学校……的同志对我们都那么尊重和亲切。”有些代表从前也受过国民党政府的邀请和招待，就更其深切地感到这一点。代表们和文工团团员们深信在中华人民共和国的大家庭中，各民族都有光明的前途。各民族代表的相互访问，因此倍增亲热。
    民族事务委员会负责人关于中央民族政策的报告和关于内蒙古自治区的介绍，因此也获得应有的效果。
    各民族代表和文工团在首都一个月的活动，使一切参加工作的干部在思想上和情感上对中央的民族政策有进一步的领会。各民族文工团联合演出十六次，单独演出七次，观众包括机关、部队人员、工人、学生和市民达十万人，发生了广泛而深刻的影响。对观众起了民族政策的教育作用，对少数民族启发了民族自尊心，在各民族文艺工作者之间则收到了互相观摩和学习的效果。
    伟大的祖国，伟大的民族团结和民族大家庭，伟大的领袖毛主席，是不容许帝国主义侵犯的。当看到人民日报宣布的美帝国主义侵略中国的阴谋和挑衅，就立即激起了崇高的愤慨，由西南代表的倡议，每一个代表都在抗美援朝的联合声明上签了名。此外，又作了各种民族语言的广播。
    这次各民族代表和文工团来北京参加国庆节在政治上和精神上的收获，是不可限量的。
    （三）在和各民族代表的谈话和访问中，多少了解了各民族的情况和要求。关于民族情况的材料，当分别加以整理。关于要求方面，大要有以下几项：
    （１）各民族的区域自治要快点进行。各级人民政府特别是各民族杂居区的民族联合政府，要适当增加少数民族人员，过去有些地方少了，或是注意不够。
    （２）多办民族学校，大量培养干部。恢复或设立各民族的中小学。内地的高等学校和中学要设立少数民族学生的公费名额，投考时要适当地照顾目前少数民族学生的文化水平。
    （３）多用各民族的文字出版书报和翻译著作，多去少数民族地区进行文艺工作。
    （４）多给各项卫生和医疗设备。
    （５）加强贸易工作，把少数民族地区的土产输出，生活必需品输进。
    （６）中央多派干部到各民族地区去领导和帮助工作。
    （７）今后希望多组织少数民族人士参观考察。
    这些要求是合理的，与中央宗旨相符合，与周总理在国庆节报告中所指出的民族工作方针相符合。周总理曾特别指出必须有计划有步骤地实现区域自治与大量培养民族干部这两项首要任务。
    （四）由于人民大革命和人民解放战争在全国范围内取得了基本的胜利，打倒了各民族的共同敌人，已经使国内的民族关系发生了根本变化，从民族间压迫与被压迫的关系，转变为平等互助的关系。又由于中央人民政府和各级人民政府做了许多的工作，使历史上造成的民族间的仇恨、隔阂、猜忌，特别是汉民族对各少数民族的歧视和少数民族对汉民族的不信任，也开始有了一些改变。然而这种歧视和不信任，既是长久历史所造成，也就需要一个相当的时间才能加以消除。这里的问题是需要经常注意地根据具体事实在大民族中纠正大民族主义倾向，在少数民族中纠正狭隘民族主义倾向，各自检讨，分工进行，目前尤应着重于纠正汉民族和汉人干部中的大民族主义倾向。
    目前首要任务之一在于实行共同纲领中民族的区域自治政策。我们正在研究和起草一个实行民族区域自治通则的大纲。鉴于各民族的情况很多不同，其发展程度很不平衡，民族区域自治的具体内容和具体形式，也势必有所不同，因此关于通则的规定只能是大纲式的，而在实行时必须根据当地具体情况，并采取必要的准备和步骤。
    目前的另一个首要任务，是普遍而大量地培养民族干部，这是圆满地实行民族区域自治和在民族区域做好一切工作的关键。我们提出了一个培养少数民族干部的试行方案和筹办中央民族学院的试行方案，请求予以审核批准，以便进行。
    在汉民族与各少数民族间存在着历史上造成的政治、经济、文化水平的事实上的不平等，这需要长期的努力，其中包括汉民族的帮助，才能加以改变。目前各民族迫切需要帮助的是医药卫生，物产交流和文化教育，要请中央各主管部门特别加以注意，在明年计划内把这些工作列入适当地位，在经费方面有必要的准备，并考虑在条件略为具备时召集这三方面的专业会议，以资推进。
    中央民族事务委员会的人力极不充实，因此工作也极不充实，需要逐步加以解决，才能适应民族工作日益发展的形势。
    （五）在报告结束时，应当提到这次从各方面调来参加招待工作的干部，一般地搞好了民族关系，完成了任务。同时从各民族代表的口中，我们也知道在少数民族中工作的汉人干部，虽有小部分出了偏差，但极大多数是艰苦工作，遵守政策的。出了偏差的同志，在经过批评教育之后，有些已经有了改正。关键仍在上面的正确领导与及时教育，动员和鼓励适当的汉民族干部去少数民族地区工作，仍是必要的。不遵守政策而又不愿改正的固应加撤回，但确守政策，艰苦工作而有成绩的，则须予以奖励。
