[Report from this Newspaper] Patriotic pledges signed by people from all walks of life across the country have powerfully promoted the development of production and various tasks. Up to now, workers, industrialists and businesspeople, farmers, government employees, women, students, educators, cultural figures, medical professionals, religious figures, militia, and others in various regions have formulated patriotic pledges. Some cities have formulated joint patriotic pledges for people from all walks of life in the city. The movement to sign patriotic pledges has expanded from large cities to small and medium-sized cities and has begun to develop in rural areas. In some cities, it has developed from being organized by different sectors to being organized by various industries and trades, as well as workshops and neighborhoods. In Shanghai alone, thousands of grassroots trade unions in the industrial sector have separately signed patriotic pledges.

Before formulating patriotic pledges, various regions and sectors generally conducted extensive current affairs publicity activities to enlighten the political consciousness of the masses, so that the formulation and implementation of patriotic pledges became a mass-based, conscious movement. For example, before formulating patriotic pledges, Shanghai's neighborhoods carried out publicity in the form of slide shows, crosstalk, and costumed speeches, and mobilized the broad masses to launch denunciations of the atrocities of American and Japanese imperialism, which raised the political awareness of the masses. The masses consciously put forward the demand to formulate patriotic pledges and expressed their determination to implement them resolutely in practical actions. Women in cities such as Beijing and Qingdao adopted patriotic pledges at rallies and demonstrations against the rearmament of Japan by the United States. More than 3,000 industrial and commercial households in Nanjing signed patriotic pledges one after another after holding separate meetings to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Before signing patriotic pledges, the industrial and commercial circles in Shouchun County, northern Anhui, first convened a current affairs symposium. The participants recognized the aggressive face of American imperialism, which laid the ideological foundation for signing patriotic pledges. Many places conducted serious and detailed discussions when signing patriotic pledges. For example, female staff members of 23 units directly under the Northeast People's Government successively held symposiums to discuss the content of the patriotic pledges and guaranteed their resolute implementation.

As a result of the earnest implementation of patriotic pledges in various places, the appearance of production and various tasks has been renewed. For example, workers in the sheet metal workshop of a factory in Shanghai, in fulfilling their patriotic pledges, demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for production. The manufacture of twenty jacks was originally estimated to require 120 workdays, but in the end it only took 46.2 workdays. Industrialists and businesspeople in various regions used the practical action of enthusiastically paying taxes to fulfill their patriotic pledges. The paper-making industry in Dadong District, Shenyang, paid all taxes on the second day (February 29) after the tax task was assigned. Industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai recently cleared 55.5 billion in back taxes. The masses expressed extreme dissatisfaction with those who failed to fulfill their patriotic pledges. Ruichang and Yihongxiang coal companies in Nanjing privately raised coal prices, and members of the industry association unanimously demanded that the government severely punish them. In order to earnestly implement the patriotic pledges, the staff of 34 teams of the East China Trade Department in Shanghai and the industrial and commercial circles in Hefei City, northern Anhui, are currently inspecting the implementation of the patriotic pledges. Some units of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, in the past, formulated patriotic pledges that were not practical enough and did not check on their implementation, which led to formalism. As the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and oppose the rearmament of Japan by the United States deepened, everyone's thinking has also been improved a step further, and they consciously proposed to revise the patriotic pledges. After discussion, each unit has more specifically combined them with their own work and revised the pledges made in the past.

　　各地人民纷纷订立爱国公约
    有力地推动了生产和各项工作的开展
    有的流于形式主义现正进行检查修订
    【本报讯】全国各地各界已签订的爱国公约，有力地推动了生产和各项工作的开展。截至目前为止，各地已有许多工人、工商界人士、农民、机关工作人员、妇女、学生、教育界、文化界、医药界、宗教界人士、民兵等订立了爱国公约。有些市订立了全市各界人民共同的爱国公约。签订爱国公约的运动，已由大城市发展到中小城市，并开始发展到农村。在某些城市已由过去以各界为单位发展到各行各业以及车间与里弄。上海市仅产业部门即有数千个基层工会分别签订了爱国公约。
    各地各界在订立爱国公约之前，一般均曾进行了广泛的时事宣传活动，以启发群众的政治觉悟，使订立与履行爱国公约，成为群众性的自觉运动。如上海各里弄在订立爱国公约之前，曾以洋片、相声、化装演讲等形式进行了宣传，并发动广大群众展开对美、日帝国主义暴行的控诉，提高了群众的政治认识，群众纷纷自觉地提出订立爱国公约的要求，并表示坚决在实际行动中贯彻实行。北京、青岛等城市的妇女，在举行反对武装日本示威游行大会上，通过了爱国公约。南京市三千余工商业户在分别举行了控诉日寇暴行的会议之后，纷纷签订了爱国公约。皖北寿城工商界在签订爱国公约之前，首先召开了时事座谈会，与会者认识了美帝国主义的侵略面目，为签订爱国公约打下了思想基础。很多地方在签订爱国公约时，进行了认真而细致的讨论。如东北人民政府所属二十三个单位的妇女工作人员，曾先后召开座谈会，讨论爱国公约的内容，并保证坚决实行。
    各地认真履行爱国公约的结果，使生产与各项工作的面貌为之一新。如上海某厂冷作工场工人，在履行爱国公约中发挥了高度的生产积极性，制造起落机二十件原估计需要一百二十个工，结果只用了四十六点二个工。各地工商业者用踊跃缴纳税款的实际行动履行爱国公约。沈阳市大东区造纸业，于税收任务布置后的第二天（二月二十九日）就全部缴齐税款。上海市工商界最近清缴旧欠税款五百五十五亿。群众对于不履行爱国公约的分子，表示极为不满。南京市瑞昌、义宏祥等煤号，私自抬高煤价，该业同业公会会员一致要求政府予以严惩。为了认真贯彻爱国公约，上海市华东贸易部三十四个小组的职工，皖北合肥市工商界，目前正检查爱国公约的执行情况。上海市公安局有些单位，过去所订爱国公约的内容不够实际，而且也没有检查执行情况，以致流于形式主义；在抗美援朝、反对美国武装日本的运动逐步深入，大家的思想也又提高了一步，自觉地提出要修订爱国公约。经过讨论后，各单位已经更具体地结合本身业务，对过去订的公约作了修正。
