	Newspaper Digest
		Serving Production
	Starting from February 19th, the Northeast Daily opened a column "Rural Work Informal Discussion" on the second page. The editors proposed to first discuss the following two questions: 1. In rural work, how to combine leading agricultural production with leading other work? 2. Under the new circumstances, how to improve labor mutual aid organizations. In this column, the introduction of the recent work situation of Han En, a model agricultural laborer in Northeast China, was first published. In industrial production, the Northeast Daily also opened a similar column "Workshop Work". With these columns, specific problems and examples in industrial and agricultural production often appear in the newspaper.
	Organizing these manuscripts that combine current production work, and can exchange opinions and spread experience in a timely manner, launching discussions and seeking conclusions to promote the development of production, is a meaningful work and a concrete manifestation of newspapers serving production.
		Publicizing the Experience of Innovators
	Chinese workers and technicians have great creative talents. On February 19th, the Shanghai News Daily opened a column titled "Invention and Creation, Self-Reliance" on the fourth page, publishing many creative efforts made by the industrial sector in order to break the imperialist blockade and achieve economic self-reliance. In this column, we see that many industrial products that could not be manufactured in the past, or were manufactured but did not meet the standards, can now be manufactured and meet the standards. The items that have been published in this column include: quinoline oxide, mica flakes, salt brain, solid aluminum sulfate, spinning pure linen fibers on wool spinning machines, Bakelite tubes, yellow wax cloth, etc. Publishing such materials can strengthen the people's confidence and encourage the creative efforts of workers and technicians. The News Daily has done extremely important work in this regard.
	Publicizing the experience of advanced producers and innovators is an important task of newspapers. It is not difficult to imagine that in so many inventions and creations, each one contains the creative labor of many workers and technicians. If newspaper workers can conduct deeper interviews, they can obtain richer and more educational materials. Attaching importance to the creation of workers and technicians, vigorously promoting the experience of advanced individuals and innovators, and encouraging the enthusiasm for invention and creation to improve production are important responsibilities of newspaper workers.
		Representing People's Lives
	January 21st was the second anniversary of the founding of the Lüda Workers' Daily. On the 25th, the newspaper published a report by Guo Shushen, Chairman of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions, at the anniversary meeting. The report pointed out the newspaper's achievements in establishing worker correspondents, but also emphasized the main shortcomings of the newspaper—the reflection of workers' lives is extremely inadequate. This is an issue that should be given serious attention. On the one hand, it has better connected with the worker masses in the work of correspondance, but on the other hand, the newspaper rarely reflects workers' lives. This seemingly contradictory phenomenon shows that newspaper workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the mass nature of newspapers and have not more deeply implemented it into their specific work.
	Earth-shaking changes are taking place in the actual lives of the working people. It is the common responsibility of all newspapers to fully express these changes through various specific examples to educate the masses.

　　报纸动态
            为生产服务
    二月十九日起，东北日报在第二版上辟了一个专栏“农村工作笔谈会”，编者提议先讨论以下两个问题：一，在农村工作中，如何使领导农业生产工作和领导其他工作相结合；二，在新的情况下，如何提高劳动互助组织。在这栏中，首先发表了东北农业劳动模范韩恩最近工作情况的介绍。在工业生产上，东北日报也辟了类似的专栏“车间工作”。有了这些专栏，工农生产中的具体问题和范例就经常在报纸上出现了。
    组织这些结合当前生产工作，而又能及时交换意见、传播经验的稿件，展开讨论并求得结论以推动生产的发展，是一件有意义的工作，是报纸为生产服务的具体表现。
            宣传革新者的经验
    中国的工人和技术人员是有伟大的创造才能的。二月十九日上海新闻日报在第四版辟了题为“发明创造、自力更生”的专栏，发表工业界为了粉碎帝国主义的封锁、经济上自力更生而作的许多创造性的努力。在这个专栏中，我们看到许多过去自己不能制造、或制造了而不合标准的工业品，现在已可以制造而且合乎标准了。已发表在该栏中的有：氧化喹啉、云母夹片、盐脑、固体硫酸铝，在毛纺机上纺制纯麻纤维，胶木管、黄腊布等。发表这样的材料，可以坚定了人民的信心，并鼓舞工人和技术人员的创造性的努力。新闻日报在这上面已做了极重要的工作。
    宣传生产先进者、革新者的经验，是报纸的重要任务。不难想像，在这样多的发明和创造中，每一件都包含了多少工人和技术人员的创造性的劳动，报纸工作者如果能进行深一步的采访，就可以得到更为丰富和有教育意义的材料。重视工人和技术人员的创造，有力地推广先进者和革新者的经验，并鼓舞发明创造改进生产的热情，是报纸工作者的重要的责任。
            表现人民生活
    一月廿一日是旅大职工报创刊二周年纪念，廿五日该报发表了旅大总工会郭述申主席在纪念会上的报告。报告中指出该报在建立工人通讯员上的成绩，但又着重地指出了报纸的主要缺点——反映工人生活极不充分。这是应该引起严重注意的问题。一方面在通讯工作上较好的联系了工人群众，另一方面报纸上却又很少表现工人生活，这种看似矛盾的现象，表现报纸工作者对于报纸的群众性的认识还不充分，还没有更深入地贯彻到具体的工作中去。
    在劳动人民的实际生活中天翻地覆的变化正在进行，通过各种具体的事例把这些变化充分地表现出来，用以教育群众，是一切报纸的共同责任。
