Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th – Our correspondent reports: Following the use of poison gas bombs by the U.S. aggressor troops on the Han River front on February 23rd, they used poison gas shells four more times in the same combat area on February 26th, March 3rd, and March 6th. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers expressed unparalleled anger at this inhumane and brutal act of the U.S. aggressor troops, who completely disregard international law by using poison gas. They unanimously vowed to resolutely and thoroughly annihilate the U.S. aggressor army and to bring the war criminals who released the poison gas to justice and punish them.

The circumstances of the U.S. aggressor troops' repeated use of poison gas are as follows:

At 13:00 on February 23rd, two U.S. Mustang fighter planes strafed the vicinity of the Chinese People's Volunteers’ Luli position on the south bank of the Han River, more than ten kilometers east of Seoul, for twenty minutes, and then dropped several bombs, including one asphyxiating poison gas bomb. After the bomb exploded, it emitted a gas that initially appeared as a brownish-yellow plume of smoke, which then spread into a bluish-gray mist and flowed towards low-lying areas. According to a military doctor of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed at the position, those poisoned appeared haggard, coughed, had accelerated breathing, and exhibited physical tension.

At 12:00 on February 26th, the U.S. military fired one poison gas shell at the Guangzhuangli position of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the same combat area. At 20:00 on the same day, the U.S. military fired another poison gas shell at the position, which landed on a hillside north of the Guangzhuangli highway. At 16:30 on March 3rd, the U.S. military shelled the Tupingli position of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers with more than 50 shells, several of which were poison gas shells. At 22:00 on March 6th, the U.S. military fired two poison gas shells at Jiulidong. The aforementioned poison gas shells emitted light yellow or black gas after the explosion, with a smell similar to iodine, sulfur, etc. Those poisoned experienced dizziness, nausea, and weakness in their limbs, and only returned to normal after twelve hours of treatment.

The shell casing of the poison gas bombs dropped by American aircraft is made of copper, with a thickness of two-thirds of a millimeter. The shell casing of the poison gas shells is made of iron, with a thickness of one millimeter. Our reporter has collected and photographed the above-mentioned evidence of the crimes.

　　侵朝美军灭绝人性漠视国际公法
    在汉江前线数度使用毒气
    中朝人民军战士无比愤怒誓歼美军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】本社记者报道：侵朝美军继二月二十三日在汉江前线使用毒气炸弹后，又于二月二十六日、三月三日、三月六日先后四次在同一作战地区使用毒气炮弹。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对侵朝美军此种灭绝人性，完全漠视国际公法使用毒气弹的残暴行为，表示了无比的愤怒。他们一致发誓坚决彻底歼灭美国侵略军，并务必将施放毒气战犯缉拿归案惩办。
    侵朝美军历次施放毒气弹的情形如下：
    二月二十三日十三时，美国野马式战斗机两架，在汉城以东十余公里汉江南岸志愿军栗里阵地附近上空扫射二十分钟后，即投弹数枚，其中有窒息性毒气弹一枚。该弹爆炸后发出气体，初为棕黄色烟柱，随后即弥漫成为青灰色烟雾，并向低洼处流动。据守该阵地的中国人民志愿军某部军医谈：中毒者颜面憔悴，咳嗽，呼吸加速，肉体紧张。
    二月二十六日十二时，美军在同一作战地区向广庄里中国人民志愿军某部阵地施放毒气炮弹一枚。同日二十时，美军又向该阵地施放毒气炮弹，一弹落广庄里公路以北山坡上。三月三日十六时三十分，美军向中国人民志愿军某部第八连的土坪里阵地炮击落弹五十多发中，有数发为毒气弹。三月六日二十二时美军向九里洞施放毒气炮弹两枚。上述毒气炮弹爆炸后发淡黄色或黑色气体，其味有类似碘酒、硫磺等种。中毒者头晕、恶心、四肢无力，经治疗后十二小时始复常态。
    美国飞机所投毒气炸弹的弹壳为铜质，厚度三分之二公厘。毒气炮弹弹壳为铁质，厚度一公厘。上述罪证均已由本社记者收集并摄成照片。
