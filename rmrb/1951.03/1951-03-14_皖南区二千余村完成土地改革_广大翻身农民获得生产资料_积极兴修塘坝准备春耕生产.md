　　Over Two Thousand Villages in Southern Anhui Complete Land Reform
    Vast Numbers of Emancipated Peasants Obtain Means of Production
    Actively Repairing Ponds and Dams to Prepare for Spring Plowing
    By the Spring Festival this year, the land reform in southern Anhui Province had been completed in 2,200 villages. A total of 3,835 villages in the region are undergoing land reform, and it is estimated that it will be basically completed by the end of March. After being freed from feudal shackles, the vast number of peasants have an unusually high enthusiasm for production. They are actively preparing for spring plowing, and the rural atmosphere has been completely renewed.
    During the land reform movement, the political awareness of the peasants has been greatly improved, and various rural organizations have been further consolidated and expanded. According to statistics from 787 villages in twelve counties including Guichi and Shexian, the original number of Farmers' Association members was 185,675, which has now increased to 321,913. According to statistics from 333 villages, the militia has grown to 11,507 people, generally increasing by more than 50% compared to before. The vast number of peasants launched a fierce struggle against local bullies and illegal landlords. Many peasants have realized that "American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are the backers of the landlords." They have voluntarily exposed hidden bandits, special agents, and weapons hidden by landlords and bandits/agents. By the end of January, Guangde County had exposed machine guns, seven in total, and eighty-six rifles hidden by landlords, bandits and special agents. Some peasants voluntarily signed up to join the local armed forces. In Hongchuan Village, Shexian County, twenty-three emancipated peasants have voluntarily joined the army. Not only has the feudal rule of the landlord class been politically defeated, but the feudal land system of the landlord class has also been completely destroyed economically. According to a survey of twenty-six villages in Dongliu County, before the land reform, landlords possessed an average of 11.6 mu of land per person, rich peasants possessed 4.7 mu of land per person, middle peasants possessed 1.5 mu of land per person, and poor peasants and farm laborers possessed only 0.5 mu of land per person. After the land reform, each person possessed an average of about 2 mu of land. According to incomplete statistics from 279 villages in six counties including Guichi and Xuancheng, a total of 381,218 mu of land and 10,415 houses were confiscated and requisitioned according to law, 1,703 head of draught animals, 28,315 pieces of farm implements and 1,542,904 jin of grain were confiscated according to law. Nearly 50,000 households with 217,000 people have benefited.
    After the vast number of peasants were allocated land and other means of production, their enthusiasm for production was particularly high. They have all made their own production plans, prepared for spring plowing, actively repaired ponds and dams, restored dikes, and purchased seeds and farm tools. Xuancheng County plans to build and repair 8,131 ponds and dams, of which 2,699 have been completed, and 1,719 are under construction. After the Spring Festival, the vast number of peasants have begun to work in the fields to hoe wheat, weed, and dredge pond mud.

　　皖南区二千余村完成土地改革
    广大翻身农民获得生产资料 
    积极兴修塘坝准备春耕生产
    皖南区土地改革至今年春节止，已完成二千二百个村庄。该区进行土地改革的村庄一共三千八百三十五个，估计三月底即可基本完成。广大农民解除封建束缚后，生产情绪异常高涨，正积极准备春耕生产，农村气象已焕然一新。
    在土地改革运动中，农民的政治觉悟大大提高，农村的各种组织更加巩固扩大，据贵池、歙县等十二个县七百八十七个村庄的统计，原有农会会员一十八万五千六百七十五人，现已发展至三十二万一千九百一十三人。又据三百三十三个村庄的统计，民兵已发展至一万一千五百零七人，一般的较前增加百分之五十以上。广大农民向恶霸与不法地主展开了猛烈的斗争。很多农民已经认识到“美帝国主义、蒋介石是地主的后台老板”，他们自动检举隐藏的土匪、特务分子及地主和土匪特务分子隐藏的武器。广德县至一月底已检举出地主与土匪、特务分子隐藏的机枪七挺、步枪八十六枝。有的农民自动报名参加地方武装，歙县洪川村已有二十三个翻身农民自动参军。不仅在政治上打垮了地主阶级的封建统治，而且在经济上也彻底摧毁了地主阶级封建的土地制度。据东流县二十六个村庄的调查，土地改革前平均地主每人占有土地一十一亩六分，富农每人占有土地四亩七分，中农每人占有土地一亩五分，贫农、雇农每人占有土地只五分。土地改革后平均每人占有土地二亩左右，又据贵池、宣城等六个县二百七十九个村庄不完全的统计，共依法没收和征收土地三十八万一千二百一十八亩，房屋一万零四百一十五间，依法没收耕畜一千七百零三头，农具二万八千三百一十五件，粮食一百五十四万二千九百零四斤。有近五万户二十一万七千多人得到利益。
    广大农民分得土地和其他生产资料后，生产情绪特别高涨，都订立了自己的生产计划，准备春耕，积极兴修塘坝，修复圩堤，购买种籽农具等。宣城县计划兴修八千一百三十一个塘坝，现已完成二千六百九十九个，正兴修的有一千七百一十九个。春节后广大农民已开始下田锄麦、除草和捞塘泥等。
