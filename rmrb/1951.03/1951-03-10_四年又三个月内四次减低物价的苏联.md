    Four Price Reductions in Four Years and Three Months in the Soviet Union

    On March 1st, the food stores in Moscow opened at 9 a.m. as usual. The counters and shelves were neatly arranged with all kinds of food, uniformly marked with new prices reduced by more than 10 percent. The shop assistants, wearing spotless white work clothes, greeted the customers, who seemed more crowded than usual, with smiles. The customers selected their favorite foods, paid in turn at the cashier, and then received the weighed food from the shop assistants with their receipts. This scene, which could be found in any food store, was as quiet and orderly as usual. But the customers were excited. For example, in Food Store No. 27 in the Frunze district, several customers were talking while shopping. Caretaker Bayushkina said, "Last night I calculated with my children that we can now buy 130 rubles more worth of food each month. How can I not be grateful to the government and our dear Party for taking such good care of us!" Housewife Staltsinova said, "My husband is an ironworker, and my son-in-law and daughter are both working. We have calculated that the price reduction will give us an extra income of no less than 300 rubles a month." Scherkiev, who lives on a pension, said, "Now workers abroad see once again that the Soviet government supports peace. It spends tens of billions of rubles on improving our lives, not on armaments."
    From December 1947 to the present, in a short period of four years and three months, the Soviet Union has carried out four nationwide price reductions. Taking only the recent three bread price reductions as an example, before the second price reduction in March 1949, the price of half a kilogram of white bread was 4 rubles; before the third price reduction in March 1950, it was 3 rubles and 60 kopecks; before this price reduction, it was 2 rubles and 52 kopecks; and after this price reduction, it is 2 rubles and 20 kopecks, a reduction of nearly half in three years. The four price reductions have benefited the people by 301.5 billion rubles. This is an astonishing figure, which, if converted at the current exchange rate, is equal to more than 75.3 billion US dollars. This astonishing figure exceeds the current US $67.7 billion military expansion budget and more than doubles the $35.7 billion increase in military spending after the US aggression against Korea. Who is working to improve the happiness and well-being of their people, and who is working to slaughter the people of other countries and push their own people into the abyss of suffering? Isn't it obvious?
    The Soviet Union's almost annual price reductions are the result of the Soviet people's successful completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan and their selfless labor. Under the superior socialist system, the Soviet people have restored and developed the national economy with selfless labor, and the prosperity of the national economy has continuously improved and enriched the people's material lives.
    In 1947, the second year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the various sectors of the Soviet national economy achieved great success: the total industrial output in the fourth quarter of 1947 began to exceed the pre-war level of 1940; the total agricultural output was 32 percent higher than in 1946, with the total grain harvest 58 percent higher, and the difficulties caused by the severe drought in 1946 were completely overcome. On the basis of this achievement, on December 16, 1947, simultaneously with the currency reform, the Soviet Union abolished the rationing system left over from the war. The unified prices of goods after the abolition of rationing were greatly reduced compared to the prices of non-rationed goods before. The same amount of rubles could buy two and a half times as much food or 3.2 times as much industrial goods as before. The reduction in prices after the abolition of rationing benefited the people by 86 billion rubles a year. The people's purchasing power was greatly increased as a result. In 1948, sales of bread increased by 56 percent compared to 1947, sugar doubled, confectionery increased by 45 percent, textiles increased by 55 percent, and leather shoes increased by 45 percent.
    In 1948, the Soviet national economy continued to develop. In that year, the total industrial output exceeded the pre-war level by 18 percent. Although there was a drought in the Volga River basin, the total grain harvest still exceeded 7 billion poods, reaching approximately the level of 1940. In this year, some goods, such as watches, radios, and cars, were also partially reduced in price. By March 1, 1949, on the basis of new economic achievements, the Soviet Union reduced prices for the second time. The prices of bread, meat, fish, animal oil, etc. were reduced by 10 percent, wool and silk fabrics, etc. were reduced by 12 percent, radios, etc. by 20 percent, and watches, etc. by 30 percent. This price reduction benefited the people by 71 billion rubles a year. As a result of the price reduction and the expansion of the trade network, in 1949, the Soviet people bought 20 percent more goods than in 1948; of which, 17 percent more food and 25 percent more industrial goods. The quantities of oil, sugar, meat, fish, macaroni, wool, silk, cotton fabrics, shoes, etc. purchased all exceeded the pre-war level of 1940.
    In 1949, the Soviet national economy took another step forward. In that year, the total industrial output exceeded 1948 by 20 percent and 1940 by 41 percent. By the end of the year, the average monthly industrial output had exceeded the level of 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Labor productivity increased by 13 percent compared to 1948, and production costs decreased by 7.3 percent. The total agricultural output also exceeded the pre-war level. The total grain harvest reached 7.6 billion poods, exceeding the level of 1940 and almost reaching the quota for 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The harvests of cotton, flax, sunflower, and potatoes, as well as the cattle on collective farms, all exceeded the pre-war levels. In 1949, the Soviet national income increased by 17 percent compared to 1948 and by more than 36 percent compared to 1940. On the basis of such great achievements, on March 1, 1950, the Soviet Union reduced prices for the third time. Bread prices were reduced by 20 to 30 percent, meat prices were reduced by 24 to 35 percent, animal oil prices were reduced by 30 percent, textile prices were reduced by 12 to 24 percent, clothing prices were reduced by 10 to 22 percent, and shoe prices were reduced by 15 to 25 percent. At the same time, restaurants, canteens, teahouses, and cafes all reduced prices. This price reduction benefited the people by 110 billion rubles a year. As a result of several, especially this price reduction, the purchasing power of the ruble was greatly increased. The exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies was also greatly increased. The ratio of the ruble to the US dollar was increased from six to one to four to one. In that year, the people bought 30 percent more goods than in 1949; of which, 27 percent more food and 35 percent more industrial goods. They bought 49 percent more sausages, 29 percent more fish products, 47 percent more animal oil, 20 percent more sugar, 27 percent more confectionery, 29 percent more cereals and macaroni, and 30 percent more milk and milk products; they bought 36 percent more textiles, 33 percent more clothing, 48 percent more leather shoes, 38 percent more furniture, 45 percent more gramophones, 26 percent more radios, 40 percent more cameras, and 44 percent more motorcycles.
    In 1950, the Soviet national economy achieved new successes. In 1950, the total industrial output exceeded 1949 by 23 percent and the pre-war 1940 by 73 percent. Labor productivity increased by 12 percent compared to 1949, and production costs decreased by about 6 percent. The total grain harvest was 7.6 billion poods, which exceeded the pre-war level by more than 300 million poods. Livestock breeding also saw new developments. The national income increased by 21 percent compared to 1949. On the basis of these achievements, the Soviet Union recently reduced prices for the fourth time. This price reduction will benefit the people by at least about 34.5 billion rubles.
    Four price reductions in four years, systematically improving the material lives of the people in this way, is a characteristic of a socialist society where political power belongs to the people, the means of production belong to society, and production is developed in a planned way.
    The situation in the United States and countries within the dollar sphere of influence is the opposite. For example, in January of this year, wholesale food prices in the United States increased by 24.3 percent compared to January of last year. After US imperialism launched its aggression against Korea, in the third quarter of last year, the profits of US arms dealers increased by more than 50 percent compared to the third quarter of 1949; at the same time, more than half of the families in the United States lived on a standard that was 25 to 30 percent lower than the miserable minimum living standard. In Japan under MacArthur's rule, prices have risen by 50 percent since the United States launched its aggression against Korea; the American rulers have made the number of fully and partially unemployed workers in Japan, plus the surplus labor force in rural areas, reach 18 million.

　　四年又三个月内四次减低物价的苏联
    李何
    三月一日，莫斯科的食品店像平常一样在上午九点钟开了门，柜上架上整齐地排列着各式俱全的食品，一律标着减低百分之十以上的新价目。穿着洁白工作服的店员们，笑吟吟地迎接着显得比往常拥挤的顾客。顾客们选好中意的食品，挨次在付款处付钱取票，又挨次凭票向店员领取过磅后的食品。随便在那一家食品店都遇得见的这种情形，像往常一样的安静、有秩序。但是顾客们的心情是兴奋的。例如，在福龙芝区第二十七号食品店，有几个顾客一边买东西一边谈论着。看护巴由什金娜说：“昨晚我跟孩子们计算一下，我们现在每月可以多买一百三十卢布的食品。我怎能不感激政府和亲爱的党这样关心我们呢！”主妇斯塔尔辛诺娃说：“我的丈夫是铁工，女婿和女儿都在做工。我们计算过，减低物价使我们一月多收入不下三百卢布。”靠养老金过活的薛尔基耶夫说：“现在国外劳动者又一次看到苏联政府支持和平。它花百十亿卢布在改善我们的生活上，而不是在军备上。”
    从一九四七年十二月到现在，短短的四年又三个月中，苏联举行了四次全国规模的减低物价。仅拿最近三次面包减价情形来说，在一九四九年三月第二次减价以前，白面包半公斤价为四卢布，一九五零年三月第三次减价以前为三卢布六十戈比，这次减价以前为二卢布五十二戈比，这次减价后为二卢布二十戈比，三年中减低了将近一半。四次减价使人民得益三千零十五亿卢布。这是惊人的数目，如果按目前外汇汇率折合，等于七百五十三亿多美元。这个惊人的数目，它超过目前美国的六百七十七亿美元的扩军预算，超过美国侵略朝鲜后增加的军费三百五十七亿美元一倍以上。谁为了提高本国人民的幸福生活，谁为了屠杀别国人民并把本国人民推到苦难的深渊去，难道还不明显吗？
    苏联的几乎一年一度的减低物价，是由于苏联人民顺利地完成战后五年计划的结果，是由于苏联人民忘我地劳动的结果。在优越的社会主义制度下，苏联人民以忘我的劳动恢复和发展了国民经济，而国民经济的繁荣便使人民物质生活不断地提高和富裕起来。
    在一九四七年，战后五年计划的第二年，苏联国民经济各部门获得了巨大成就：一九四七年第四季工业总产量开始超出战前一九四零年的水平；农业总产量比一九四六年高出百分之三十二，其中谷物总收获量高出百分之五十八，一九四六年大旱所造成的困难完全克服了。在这成就的基础上，一九四七年十二月十六日，和货币改革同时，苏联取消了战时留下来的配给制。废除配给制后的货物的统一价格，比以前非配给品的价格大大减低了。同样数目的卢布可以买到等于以前两倍半的食物或三点二倍的工业品。配给制废除后物价的减低，使人民一年得益八百六十亿卢布。人民的购买力因而大大提高。一九四八年面包的销售量比一九四七年增加了百分之五十六，糖增加了一倍，糖果增加百分之四十五，纺织品增加百分之五十五，皮鞋增加百分之四十五。
    在一九四八年，苏联国民经济向前发展着。这一年工业总产量超过了战前水平百分之十八。虽然伏尔加河流域有旱灾，谷物总收获量仍超过七十亿普特，约达一九四零年的水平。这一年有些货物如表、收音机、小汽车等也局部减价了。到了一九四九年三月一日，在经济新成就的基础上，苏联第二次减低了物价。面包、肉、鱼、动物油等减价百分之十，毛丝织品等减价百分之十二，收音机等百分之二十，表等百分之三十。这次减低物价，使人民一年得益七百一十亿卢布。由于减低物价和扩大贸易网的结果，一九四九年苏联人民比一九四八年多买了百分之二十的货物；其中多买食物百分之十七，工业品百分之二十五。所买的油、糖、肉、鱼、通心粉、毛丝棉织品、鞋等等数量都超过了战前一九四零年。
    在一九四九年，苏联国民经济又前进了一步。这一年工业总产量超过了一九四八年百分之二十，超过了一九四零年百分之四十一。这一年年底，每月平均的工业生产量已超过了五年计划所规定的一九五零年的水平。劳动生产率比一九四八年提高了百分之十三，产品成本减低了百分之七点三。农业总产量也超过了战前水平。谷物的总收获量达七十六亿普特，超过了一九四零年水平，几乎达到五年计划规定的一九五零年的定额。棉、亚麻、向日葵、马铃薯的收成，以及集体农场的牛，都超过了战前水平。一九四九年苏联国民收入比一九四八年增加了百分之十七，比一九四○年增加了百分之三十六以上。在这样巨大成就的基础上，一九五零年三月一日，苏联第三次减低了物价。面包减价百分之二十到三十，肉类减价百分之二十四到三十五，动物油减价百分之三十，纺织品减价百分之十二到二十四，衣服减价百分之十到二十二，皮鞋减价百分之十五到二十五。同时，饭馆、食堂、茶馆、咖啡馆都减价了。这一次减低物价，使人民一年得益一千一百亿卢布。几次特别是这次减低物价的结果，卢布的购买力大大提高了。卢布与外汇的折合率也大大提高了。卢布与美金的比率由六比一提高为四比一。这一年人民购买的货物比一九四九年多百分之三十；其中食物多百分之二十七，工业品多百分之三十五。他们多买了香肠百分之四十九，鱼制品百分之二十九，动物油百分之四十七，糖百分之二十，糖果百分之二十七，麦片通心粉百分之二十九，牛乳及牛乳制品百分之三十；多买了纺织品百分之三十六，衣服百分之三十三，皮鞋百分之四十八，家具百分之三十八，留声机百分之四十五，收音机百分之二十六，照相机百分之四十，摩托车百分之四十四。
    在一九五零年，苏联国民经济又获得了新的成就。一九五零年工业总产量超过一九四九年百分之二十三，超过战前一九四零年百分之七十三。劳动生产率较一九四九年提高了百分之十二，产品成本减低了约百分之六。谷物总收获量为七十六亿普特，即超过了战前三亿多普特。牲畜饲养业也有新的发展。国民收入比一九四九年增加了百分之二十一。在这些成就的基础上，最近苏联第四次减低了物价。这次减低物价至少使人民获益约三百四十五亿卢布。
    四年四次减低物价，这样有系统地改进人民的物质生活，是政权属于人民、生产资料属于社会和有计划地发展生产的社会主义社会的特色。
    美国和美元势力范围内的国家的情形是相反的。例如：今年一月，美国食物批发价格比去年一月增加了百分之二十四点三。美帝国主义侵略朝鲜后，去年第三季，美国军火商的利润比一九四九年第三季增加了百分之五十以上；同时美国半数以上家庭却过着比维持悲惨的最低生活水平还低百分之二十五到三十的生活。在麦克阿瑟统治下的日本，从美国发动侵略朝鲜以来，物价就上涨了百分之五十；美国统治者使日本完全失业和局部失业的工人加上农村过剩劳动力已达到一千八百万人。
