　　Happy Female Workers of the New China

    In the past year, the female workers of the New China have written a brilliant page in the history of the Chinese women's liberation movement.

    In national construction, female workers, together with male workers, overcame numerous difficulties such as a lack of raw materials and the bombing, blockade, and sabotage by the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, and finally rapidly restored and developed production. The textile industry, where female workers account for more than half of the workforce, is one of China's largest industries. The output of cotton yarn in 1950 approached the highest pre-war output (97 percent of the 1930 output). During the nationwide campaign to produce 20-count yarn by workers in spinning mills in October and November of last year, they overfulfilled the task assigned by the government and received a bonus of 500 million yuan from the State Council of the Central People's Government. The state-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile No. 2 Factory, under the East China Textile Administration Bureau, achieved a spindle-shift (i.e., 20-hour output of 20-count yarn) of 1.2788 pounds during the campaign to produce 20-count yarn, setting a national record. In the patriotic production competition to resist American aggression and aid Korea, female workers persisted in their production posts and increased output and quality. Under the enthusiastic leadership of female worker Pan Xiuying, the "Locomotive King," the Shenyang Rubber No. 7 Factory completed its annual production task for cotton shoes and lined shoes by mid-November. Their first-grade products increased to 98 percent of the total products. In Northeast China alone, 1,849 female workers created new records. Among the 507 model workers in three factories in Jinan, 297 were female workers. Some female workers also volunteered to work on the Korean front, or insisted on working regardless of life and death under American bombing. Female truck drivers An Guiye and Zhang Shuxian in Dalian and Lushun volunteered to go to Korea to do transportation work. Telephone operator Wang Jingbin in Andong led all staff to persist in working under American bombing. They said: As long as we have a breath, we will definitely ensure smooth telephone communication and safe transportation.

    In the New China, the political status of female workers has been greatly improved. Many female workers have participated in government work and are managing state affairs. Female worker representatives attend meetings from the National People's Political Consultative Conference to the People's Representative Conferences at all levels. Tang Guifen, a female worker in a Shanghai yarn factory, is not only the Minister of the Women Workers Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, but also serves as a member of the East China Military and Political Committee and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labor. Yan Jinfen, a female worker at the Da Xing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang, serves as a member of the Municipal People's Government. Many female workers have been promoted to factory administrative cadres or technical management cadres. The state-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile No. 8 Factory, under the East China Textile Administration Bureau, promoted 19 workers to staff positions, seven of whom were female workers. Some female workers now hold positions as managers, factory directors, military representatives, and liaisons. In the transportation sector, many female workers have served as passenger transport directors, passenger train conductors, train dispatchers, factory workshop foremen, and team leaders. According to incomplete statistics from Northeast China alone, 2,824 female worker cadres have been promoted in the past three years.

    The working conditions of female workers have been improved, and welfare undertakings have been gradually developed. Factories in various places have implemented equal pay for equal work for men and women. The provision of 56 days of maternity leave with full pay for female workers has been implemented in major factories across the country. Factories in Shenyang, Harbin, Shanxi, and other places have stipulated that "female workers who are seven months pregnant or more should not work night shifts." Some factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Northeast China provide physical examinations for female workers, hold lectures on maternal and infant hygiene, and establish maternal and child health centers. Many factories with a large number of female workers have hired gynecologists and midwives and established factory nurseries. According to statistics, there are currently 286 factory nurseries nationwide. These nurseries care for 11,962 children, relieving female workers of many burdens and nurturing a strong second generation for the New China.

    The female workers of the New China are enjoying unprecedented cultural lives. Among the 9,115 illiterate female workers in Dalian and Lushun, 8,640 have participated in learning, accounting for 94.8 percent of the illiterate female workers. With their efforts, many female workers have been elected as learning models. Wang Lindi, a female worker in her forties at a Shanghai yarn factory, worked hard to learn culture after liberation and was rated as a special-grade learning model. She also attended the National Conference on Workers and Peasants Education and received encouragement from Chairman Mao in person. Female workers are very active in various cultural activities organized by trade unions such as cultural palaces, clubs, theater troupes, singing groups, dance parties, picnics, and travel in various places.

    The road for the female workers of the New China is infinitely broad. Various technical departments are opening their doors to female workers. Among the 46 technologies in 17 industrial units in Northeast China, there are 2,556 female technicians. Female workers have also participated in work that no women had ever participated in before. Tian Guiying and others in Dalian and Lushun have been driving trains like male workers and have safely traveled 48,700 kilometers. Women's package crews have appeared on the railway lines in Tianjin, Jilin, Harbin, and other places. Teams of female tractor drivers are working hard on the North China Plain. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, with the development of the New China's industrial construction, female workers, like male workers, have a glorious future!

　　幸福的新中国女工
    一年来，新中国的女工在中国妇女解放运动史上写下了辉煌的一页。
    女工们在国家建设上和男工们一起艰苦地克服了原料缺乏、美蒋匪帮的轰炸、封锁和破坏等重重困难，终于迅速地恢复和发展了生产。女工占半数以上的纺织工业，是中国最大工业之一。一九五零年的棉纱产量已接近了战前的最高产量（为一九三○年产量的百分之九十七）。在去年十月、十一月份全国纱厂工人突击生产二十支纱时，超额完成政府所交给的任务，得到中央人民政府政务院五亿元的奖金。华东纺织管理局所属国营上海棉纺织第二厂在突击生产二十支纱时，锭扯（即二十支纱二十小时产量）达一·二七八八磅，创全国最高纪录。在抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛中，女工们坚持生产岗位，并提高了产量和质量。沈阳市橡胶第七厂在“火车头大王”女工潘秀英的热情带动下，在十一月中旬就完成了棉鞋和夹鞋的全年生产任务。她们的一级产品提高到总产品的百分之九十八。创造新纪录的女工，仅东北一地就有一千八百四十九人。济南市三个工厂的头等劳动模范五百零七人中，女工就占二百九十七人。有些女工并志愿赴朝鲜前线工作，或在美机轰炸下不顾生死地坚持工作，旅大汽车女司机安桂叶、张淑贤等志愿去朝鲜做运输工作。安东电话员王静彬在美国飞机轰炸下，带领全体工作人员坚持工作。他们并说：只要我们有一口气，就一定保证电话畅通，运输安全。
    在新中国，女工们的政治地位已大大提高。许多女工参加了政权工作，管理着国家大事。从全国人民政治协商会议到各级政府的人民代表会议，都有女工代表出席。上海市纱厂女工汤桂芬不仅是上海市总工会女工部部长，她还担任着华东军政委员会的委员和劳动部副部长。石家庄大兴纱厂女工阎金芬担任了市人民政府委员。很多女工被提拔为工厂行政干部或技术管理干部。华东纺织管理局所属国营上海棉纺织第八厂提拔了十九个工人为职员，其中有七个是女工。有些女工现在已担任着经理、厂长、军事代表、联络员的职务。在交通事业方面有不少女工已担任客运主任、客运列车长、运转车长、工厂车间的工务员、领班等。仅据东北不完全的统计，三年来即共提拔女工干部二千八百二十四人。
    女工的劳动条件已经得到改善，福利事业也已逐步开展。各地工厂实行了男女同工同酬。女工生产假期五十六天，工资照发的规定已在各地的大工厂执行。沈阳、哈尔滨、山西等地的工厂已有“怀孕七月以上的女工不作夜工”的规定。上海、天津、青岛和东北等地有些工厂更为女工检查身体，举办妇婴卫生讲座和建立妇幼保健站。有许多女工多的工厂已聘请了妇科医生、助产士和设立了工厂托儿所。据统计，现全国已有工厂托儿所二百八十六处。这些托儿所受托了一万一千九百六十二个孩子，给女工们解除了很多牵累，也给新中国培育了壮健的第二代。
    新中国的女工们享受着前所未有的文化生活，旅大九千一百一十五名女工文盲中就有八千六百四十名女工参加学习，占女工文盲百分之九十四·八。凭着她们的努力，很多女工当选了学习模范。上海纱厂四十多岁的女工王林弟，在解放后努力学文化，被评为特等学习模范。她并出席了全国工农教育会议，受到毛主席当面的勉励。在各地文化宫、俱乐部、剧团、歌咏团、跳舞会、野游、旅行等各种工会组织的文化活动中，女工们都很活跃。
    新中国女工们的道路是宽阔无比的。各种技术部门都向女工们打开着大门。东北十七个产业单位四十六种技术中就有二千五百五十六个女技术工人。女工并参加了从来没有妇女参加的工作。旅大田桂英等已经和男工一样地驾驶着火车，并已安全行走了四万八千七百公里。天津、吉林、哈尔滨等地铁路上都出现了妇女包乘组。华北大平原上成队的女拖拉机手正在辛勤地耕耘。在共产党和人民政府的领导下，随着新中国工业建设的发展，女工们和男工们同样都有着辉煌的前途！（附图片）
