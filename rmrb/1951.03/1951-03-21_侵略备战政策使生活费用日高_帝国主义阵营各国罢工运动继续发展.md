Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: With the rising cost of living caused by war preparation policies, the wave of strikes demanding wage increases is continuing to develop in various countries within the imperialist camp.

In France, transport workers in Paris, following a 24-hour general strike on February 26th, began an indefinite strike on March 16th to protest the government's refusal to approve a monthly wage increase of 6,000 francs. Despite the French government mobilizing a large number of military police in an attempt to obstruct the strike, and directing the use of paid newspapers and right-wing Socialist Party trade union leaders to launch despicable instigations and slanders, the 34,000 transport workers in the city, belonging to various unions, remained united and acted in unison. Currently, all subway trains and buses in Paris have been shut down, and transportation in the city and suburbs has been paralyzed. On the evening of the 19th, the strike also expanded to the electricity and gas sectors, with many electricity and gas workers responding to the call from union leaders that day to take concerted action with the transport workers, beginning their work stoppage on the night shift. French Prime Minister Queuille convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the night of the 19th to discuss how to cope with the critical situation.

In London, England, 10,000 dockworkers held their fifth strike on the 16th to protest the court's re-trial of seven leaders from the all-England dockworkers' general strike in early February. Striking workers gathered in front of the courthouse, chanting slogans such as "Abolish the anti-strike law." One hundred and sixty ships have been stopped from sailing in the Port of London due to the strike.

In New Zealand, the nationwide dockworkers' strike demanding wage increases, which began on February 19th, has persisted for a month. Although the Holland government has used all sorts of despicable means, including mobilizing the army to unload ships, seizing all funds of the dockworkers' union and revoking its legal recognition, and prohibiting striking workers from raising funds to support the strike, the striking workers are still persisting in their struggle.

In Norway, workers in various textile industries in Kristiansand have begun a general strike to protest employers' arbitrary wage reductions.

    侵略备战政策使生活费用日高
    帝国主义阵营各国罢工运动继续发展
    【新华社二十日讯】随着备战政策所引起的生活费用的日益上涨，帝国主义阵营各国此伏彼起的要求增加工资的罢工运动，正在继续发展中。
    法国巴黎全市的交通工人，继二月二十六日举行的二十四小时大罢工之后，于三月十六日又开始无限期的罢工，抗议政府拒绝批准每月增加工资六千法郎的要求。尽管法国政府动员了大批军警力图阻挠，并指使御用报纸和右翼社会党工会头目协力发动了卑鄙的挑拨和诽谤，但是隶属于各个不同工会的全市三万四千名交通工人，仍坚持团结，一致行动。目前，巴黎各路地下电车与公共汽车已全部停驶，市内和近郊交通已陷于瘫痪状态。十九日晚，罢工并已扩大到电气和煤气部门，许多电气和煤气工人响应工会领袖当日发出的与交通工人采取一致行动的号召，当天夜班即开始停止工作。法国总理葛义十九日夜召集了内阁紧急会议，讨论如何应付危急的局势。
    在英国的伦敦，一万码头工人于十六日举行第五次罢工，抗议法庭再度审讯二月初全英码头工人大罢工中的七名领袖。罢工工人们齐集法庭门前，高呼“废除反罢工法”的口号。伦敦港口内一百六十艘船只已因罢工而停航。
    在新西兰，二月十九日开始的全国码头工人要求增加工资的罢工，迄今坚持已达一月之久。赫兰政府虽然使用了一切卑鄙的手段，包括动员军队担任起卸船只工作、夺取码头工人工会的一切资金并撤消承认其合法性、禁止罢工工人募集支持罢工的基金等等，但是，罢工工人们仍然在坚持他们的斗争。
    在挪威，克利斯提安桑德地方各纺织工业中的工人，已开始大罢工，抗议雇主任意减低工资。
