Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: A signature campaign demanding an overall peace treaty is underway throughout Japan. In Tokyo, the capital of Japan, the youth forum of the Shibaura Vocational Stabilization Center began collecting signatures for an overall peace treaty on January 17, with a target of 3,000 signatures. As of the 25th, 1,500 signatures had been collected. The Motomachi Korean Elementary School in Machida, together with the Motomachi branch of the Tokyo Civil Engineering and Construction Workers' Union, launched a signature campaign for an overall peace treaty and collected 1,000 signatures in front of Motomachi Station. When a female worker at the Oji Factory of Japan Oil & Fats Co. in Kita-ku, Tokyo, collected signatures from female workers at the factory, she received an enthusiastic response, and 175 people signed in a short time.

The housewives of the Hodogaya Factory dormitory in Mineoka, Yokohama, launched a signature campaign for an overall peace treaty while collecting signatures for rice rations. In a short period of time, they received responses from 700 people. Forty war widows in Fukuoka City unanimously opposed rearmament and all signed demanding an overall peace treaty.

Former Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, who shamelessly advocated rearmament, held a current affairs lecture in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, on February 4, but the audience was very small. Local progressive organizations collected signatures for an overall peace treaty at the venue and quickly received responses from 109 people, accounting for more than half of the entire audience.

Ibaraki City, Osaka Prefecture, recently held mayoral elections. Masaru Nakatani, a candidate advocating for an overall peace treaty and opposing rearmament, was elected with an overwhelming majority vote with the support of local democratic groups. Nakatani received more than 60 percent more votes than the Liberal Party candidate.

    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：要求全面媾和的签名运动，正在日本各地开展中。在日本首都东京，芝浦职业安定所的青年座谈会，从一月十七日开始征集要求全面媾和的签名，目标定为三千个。至二十五日止，已经征集了一千五百个签名。原町田地方朝鲜小学生会同东京土木建筑工会原町田分会等，展开全面媾和签名运动的结果，已在原町田车站前征集了一千个签名。东京北区日本油脂公司王子工厂的一位女工，向该厂女工征集签名时，受到热烈的响应，片刻之间就有一百七十五人签了名。
    横滨市峰冈地方保土谷工厂宿舍的主妇们，在征集要求配给米的签名的同时，发动了要求全面媾和的签名运动。在短时间内，就得到七百个人的响应。福冈市的战争寡妇四十人，一致反对重新武装，她们都签名要求全面媾和。
    无耻地鼓吹重新武装的前首相芦田均，曾于二月四日在宫城县仙台市举行时事演讲会，听众寥寥无几。当地进步组织曾在会场征集全面媾和签名，迅即获得一百零九人的响应，占全部听众一半以上。
    大阪府茨木市最近曾选举市长。主张全面媾和、反对重新武装的候选人中谷光，在当地民主团体的支持下，以压倒多数票当选，中谷光所获的票数，超过自由党候选人的票数百分之六十以上。
