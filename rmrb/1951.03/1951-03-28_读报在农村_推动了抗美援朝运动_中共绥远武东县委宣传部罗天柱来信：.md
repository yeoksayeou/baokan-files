　　Reading Newspapers in Rural Areas
    Promoted the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Letter from Luo Tianzhu, Propaganda Department of the Wudong County Party Committee of the CCP in Suiyuan:
    Here, reading newspapers has played a significant role in promoting mass movements. For example, the masses in Shanggaotai Village, Fifth District, harbored hatred for the local tyrant landlords but dared not speak out, fearing they would not be able to overthrow them and would instead invite trouble. However, after reading news reports about Suiyuan's Saraqi County overthrowing local tyrant landlord Qi Zizhen and others, the masses' fighting spirit in the village was immediately aroused. In addition to accusing the local tyrant landlord Sun Weiming of using the puppet regime to oppress peasants and kill cadres, they also reflected many relevant materials. The reading group in Guijiaopu Village, after frequently reading newspaper reports on policies, laws, and news about the suppression of local tyrants, special agents, and bandits in various regions, reported to the district government the subversive activities of counter-revolutionaries Guo Changgen and Jia Mengshuan disguised in the village. The reading group in Xitucheng Village, Fourth District, after reading reports about the grievances of peasants in various places, wrote a letter saying: "After reading the newspapers, we realized that landlords are the same all over the world!" The masses throughout the village now understood the rent reduction policy. Xihezi Administrative Village in Fourth District was the village where mass work started the latest, but since the village had a reading group, reading newspapers enabled all the peasants to understand how to reduce rent, how to oppose local tyrants, and how to organize peasant associations. When district cadres came to the village to mobilize the masses, the masses surrounded the cadres and said, "We understood the policies by reading the newspapers long ago and were just waiting for you to come!" One peasant was even able to recite the eight articles on punishing unlawful landlords to the cadres.
    In addition, newspapers in rural areas have also played a significant role in expanding the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. For example, among the peasant masses in Wudong County, the saying "We must live a good life and not let the Korean people suffer" has become a universal slogan. Through widespread publicity through reading newspapers, a mass donation movement has been launched. This movement has raised the political consciousness of the peasants and fully promoted their patriotism and internationalism. Through reading newspapers, they clearly recognized that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, but they also clearly knew that American imperialism is a paper tiger. For example, when the American invading army was defeated on the Korean battlefield, the masses reflected, "American imperialism is like a spring radish, shiny on the outside but hollow on the inside!" The masses in Sangu Village also made seventeen comfort bags and sent nine dou of wheat to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. According to statistics at the end of January, the Third District alone received the following comfort items: 1,094,300 yuan in RMB, 19,435 jin of naked oat flour, 1,915 jin of wheat flour, two shi and four dou and six sheng of naked oats, 369 jin of pork, 3,255 jin of vermicelli; as well as eggs, comfort bags, towels, soap, and other items. Currently, the masses also know through reading newspapers that American imperialism is rearming Japan, and they expressed, "We resolutely oppose American imperialism rearming Japan!" They also said, "The Chinese people now have Chairman Mao's leadership, we must produce well and give all our strength, and we must never let American imperialism rearm the Japanese devils!"
    Editor's Note: Comrade Luo Tianzhu of the Propaganda Department of the Wudong County Committee of the CCP in Suiyuan Province has truthfully reflected the role of newspapers in rural areas, which is very helpful for us to improve the content of newspapers and make them more in line with the requirements of the masses. We deeply hope to continue to receive letters from readers in various regions regarding this aspect.

　　读报在农村
    推动了抗美援朝运动
    中共绥远武东县委宣传部罗天柱来信：
    在我们这里，读报对于群众运动起了不小的推动作用。比如，五区上高台村群众对恶霸地主有仇恨，但敢怒而不敢言，深怕斗不倒他们反惹出什么大祸来。可是当读到报上登的绥远萨拉齐县斗倒恶霸地主祁子珍等消息后，该村群众的斗争情绪马上被激起来了。他们除控诉了恶霸地主孙维明以伪政权压迫农民杀害干部等事实外，还反映了许多有关的材料。拐角铺村的读报组，由于经常阅读报上的政策法令和各地区反恶霸、反特务、剿匪等新闻，便向区政府控诉出伪装在村里的反革命分子郭常根、贾孟拴进行破坏活动的情况。四区西土城村读报组经过读报上所载各地农民的诉苦，来信说：“经过读报，才知道：天下地主是一样灰！”全村群众都知道减租政策了。四区西河子行政村是群众工作进行得最晚的村子，但自该村有了读报组，通过读报使全村农民都了解了怎样减租，怎样反恶霸，怎样组织农会。区干部到该村来发动群众，群众围着干部说：“我们看报早把政策弄明白了，就等着你们来哩！”还有一个农民能向干部说下八条惩治不法地主条例。
    此外，报纸在农村里对于扩大抗美援朝运动也起了很大的作用。如目前在武东县农民群众当中，“自己过好光景，不能让朝鲜人民受灾难”一语，已成为一个普遍的呼声。经过读报的广泛宣传，并掀起来群众性的捐献运动。在这运动里提高了农民的政治觉悟，充分地发扬了农民的爱国主义和国际主义精神。他们通过读报清楚地认识了美国帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，但也清楚地知道美国帝国主义是纸老虎，如当美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上吃了败仗时，群众反映说：“美国帝国主义是春天的萝卜，外面光里边糠！”三股村群众还做了十七个慰问袋和送了九斗小麦，慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。据元月底统计，仅三区收到的慰劳品就有：人民币一百零九万四千三百元，莜面一万九千四百三十五斤，白面一千九百一十五斤，莜麦两石四斗六升，猪肉三百六十九斤，粉条三千二百五十五斤；还有鸡蛋、慰问袋、毛巾、肥皂等物品。目前群众又通过读报知道美国帝国主义在武装日本了，他们表示：“坚决反对美国帝国主义重新武装日本！”他们并说：“中国人民现在有毛主席领导，我们要好好生产，拿出一切力量，决不能让美国帝国主义把日本鬼子再武装起来！”
    编者按：中共绥远省武东县委会宣传部罗天柱同志，真实地反映了报纸在农村中所起的作用，这对于我们改进报纸的内容，使其更切合群众的要求，是很有帮助的。我们深望能不断地收到各地区读者有关这一方面的来信。
