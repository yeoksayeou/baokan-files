　　"We're going to attack!"
     ——A Chronicle of the Battle on the South Bank of the Han River, Part Four
    By Our Correspondent Li Zhuang

    During the eighteen days and nights of the defense battle on the south bank of the Han River, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army not only conducted tenacious defensive operations but also continuously used victorious counterattacks to bolster their defense. Even when the enemy seemed to be at the height of their arrogance, the soldiers of the Volunteer Army resolutely declared: "We're going to attack!" To "attack" against an enemy with absolute superiority in personnel and equipment required extraordinary courage and a high degree of resourcefulness. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is precisely this kind of most glorious soldier in the world.

    On February 4th, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with a lean and capable small force, launched a proactive attack against the enemy who had infiltrated the area north of Gyeongan-ri (京安里) on the south bank of the Han River, at Hill 133, defeating a regiment of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, eliminating over 500 enemy soldiers, and creating a brilliant example of offensive defense.

    The bloody battle on the south bank of the Han River had already lasted ten days. The U.S. invading forces relentlessly attacked the Volunteer Army's mountainous positions around Gyeongan-ri day and night. The Gyeongan-ri position, like a sharp knife, was wedged dozens of miles into the enemy's formation, splitting the enemy on the east and west banks of the Han River (the Han River runs north-south here). To straighten their lines, the Americans desperately attacked this area.

    Initially, the Americans put on a show of formal warfare. First, they used dozens of planes to bomb wildly, then dozens of artillery pieces to shell fiercely, and then used tanks to cover infantry assaults. Countless tons of steel were poured onto the Volunteer Army's positions. Vegetation was scorched, rocks were shattered, and accumulated snow was melted, but the enemy could only look at the Volunteer Army's positions through binoculars. After failing to conquer for a long time, the enemy was forced to resort to their most clumsy isolated sneak attacks.

    On February 3rd, the 19th Regiment of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, fully lightened, moved from Ipo (驪州 northwest), along the Han River, northwest, attempting to control the commanding heights and overwhelm the Volunteer Army's good defensive positions. In the afternoon, the enemy occupied Hills 133, 141, 395, and 636, not far from the Volunteer Army unit's command post stationed in Seongdeok-ri (圣德里) (northeast of Gyeongan-ri).

    In the regimental headquarters of a Volunteer Army unit, an arduous task was underway. The regimental commander and political commissars were "approving commendations." This unit had been fighting the enemy for several days, with one victory after another. The soldiers had assessed merits during tense combat intervals, and the results were now sent to the regimental headquarters for approval.

    The regimental commander, political commissar, and political director were focused on discussing and thinking. "Which one is more appropriate to commend?" According to the materials sent from below, nearly one-third of the total number of personnel should be commended. Frankly speaking, one-third was not a high number; according to general standards, everyone could be considered a hero. However, in the Korean battlefield, assessing and approving commendations meant selecting heroes among heroes, so the regimental leaders had to be particularly cautious.

    The regimental leaders stood up only after hearing the report from the telephonist about the enemy situation.

    "This work can be temporarily concluded," the regimental commander said.

    "It can be temporarily concluded," the political commissar exhaled a long breath and said slowly, "However, after this battle, this work will be even more arduous. How many heroes, how many more merits will be awarded!"

    When the soldiers heard about the attack, the long-accumulated fatigue immediately vanished. Everyone knew that when we attacked, the enemy's planes and artillery would lose their effectiveness, the enemy's initiative in the attack would turn into passivity, we would strike where we wanted to, and we would exchange the enemy's significant losses at the smallest cost.

    The Second Company was ordered to attack Hill 133. This company would penetrate the enemy ranks, catching them off guard and delivering a swift and decisive blow.

    When the Second Company set off with fraternal units, it was already dark. In the mountains, the night was particularly dense, and it was impossible to see one's hand in front of one's face. After a thirty-mile forced march through the mountains, the soldiers' sweat soaked their cotton uniforms, congealing into a layer of white frost. The sick soldiers participating in the attack held canes in one hand and cocked grenades in the other. Everyone wanted to earn new and greater honors in the upcoming battle.

    As dawn approached, the Second Company reached Hill 133. The vicinity of the high ground was eerily silent; the enemy was still asleep.

    Hill 133 was a bare mountain with many rocks and few trees. The high ground had five small hilltops, and the enemy had built field fortifications. The five hilltops were not far apart, and their firepower could support each other.

    The Seventh Platoon of the Second Company served as the spearhead. Eight soldiers were divided into three groups and slowly crawled up the steep slope covered with small shrubs and thorny brambles. In this nighttime close-quarters battle, the soldiers operated independently, moving stealthily to the enemy's front lines and throwing grenades at the enemy. The enemy was thrown into chaos by our attacks, yelling wildly. The Second Company successively captured three hilltops.

    This is the kind of night combat the Volunteer Army engaged in. When the team set out, the superiors mobilized them, saying, "To seize the enemy is to win." The soldiers deeply understood that as long as we appeared in front of the enemy and charged into the effective range of grenades, the enemy would either be annihilated (killed) or captured. "At this time," the soldiers said, "our grenades can completely overwhelm the enemy's howitzers."

    As they attacked the fourth hilltop, the enemy's resistance gradually strengthened. By this time, it was gradually becoming clear, and the enemy received strong artillery support. After more than an hour of skirmishing, the enemy's deep forces had gathered. The loss of three hilltops had slowly awakened the enemy; if they continued to retreat, yesterday's "assault" would be "completely wasted."

    The Seventh Platoon captured three hilltops but also suffered considerable casualties. The Eighth Platoon was ordered to reinforce the Seventh Platoon. The enemy, taking advantage of our small numbers, launched continuous counterattacks. The Volunteer Army resolutely advanced. When attacking the fifth hilltop, the Eighth Platoon leader charged ahead. Running halfway up the mountain, two American soldiers suddenly emerged from a crack in the rocks, charging aggressively towards him. The Eighth Platoon leader raised his carbine to fire at the enemy, but the muzzle remained silent. The bullets had already been exhausted, and the enemy was charging. The Eighth Platoon leader raised his carbine and struck the first enemy. The gun struck the helmet, sparks flew, and the enemy fell in response. The second American soldier immediately charged up, about to raise his gun to fire. The Eighth Platoon leader kicked the enemy hard in the stomach, the enemy yelled twice, and tumbled down the mountain in a puff of smoke. The Eighth Platoon leader used too much force and also stumbled.

    Such life-and-death struggles continued for a long time. By the time it was fully light, the Second Company had occupied the five small hilltops on Hill 133.

    From dawn on the 4th, gunshots and battle cries echoed throughout the mountains near Hill 133. The fraternal units of the Second Company were separately eliminating the enemy. When the sun rose, six American reconnaissance planes flew low along the hilltops, scouting where their people were and where ours were. After a mixed battle, the enemy was completely disrupted by us.

    Throughout the entire day of the 4th, the enemy concentrated all their forces, launching frenzied counterattacks against Hill 133. The enemy who had fled to the north of Hill 133 also slowly contracted backward. The environment for the Second Company became increasingly perilous.

    At this time, a new form of combat began, and the enemy used all their skills. Planes bombed and strafed every hilltop; no one could count how many enemy planes there were. Barrages of artillery fire concentrated, and a shell exploded every few steps, turning the mountain into a pockmarked face and the snowy ground into black earth. One could pick up a few pieces of shrapnel with a single touch. It was now a competition of will. The enemy infiltrated our positions, and we penetrated the enemy ranks. Whoever could persevere to the end would be the victor. The result of the competition was completely the same as in the past; the enemy still failed.

    Here, many soldiers established immortal achievements. The regimental political commissar fully understood his soldiers; what he said when the approval of commendations temporarily ended was entirely correct. Like machine gunner Yu Tonglai, he killed twenty-two enemies with one gun. During the most intense combat, he held the machine gun like a rifle. When the enemy charged within a hundred meters, he began to fire single shots. When the enemy retreated, he aimed at the enemy's buttocks and fired continuous bursts. Several times, the enemy hid beneath dead angles in the rocks, and he jumped out of the fortifications, carrying his gun. Several times, the enemy's shells overturned his fortifications, and he transferred to a bomb crater next to the fortifications, continuing to fire at the enemy. The enemy used at least three machine guns to deal with him, but they did not harm a single hair on his head.

    Machine gunner Ma Zhankui's encounter seemed worse than Yu Tonglai's. But the number of enemies he killed was higher than Yu Tonglai's. The enemy's fourth charge was covered by dense artillery fire. A shell landed near Ma Zhankui's fortifications, and two soldiers fell to the ground, their blood splattering on his face. Ma Zhankui gritted his teeth and continued to fire. After shooting down wave after wave of enemies, the ammunition carrier was wounded, and only one person remained with the machine gun. Afterwards, when the ammunition ran out, Ma Zhankui was left with an empty gun and still gritted his teeth, continuing to persevere. Later, during some rare combat intervals, Ma Zhankui crawled to the front of the position, picked up two boxes of bullets left by the enemy, and continued to fire. Later, Ma Zhankui was seriously wounded, but he continued to hold the position. He knew that in this life-and-death decisive moment, if he left the front line, he would inevitably hold back one or two comrades who were firing at the enemy. Later, only after the enemy was driven back was Ma Zhankui carried down the mountain by his comrades.

    During the night attack, Hu Xueman always charged ahead. During the daytime defense, Hu Xueman always stood guard at the front. This infinitely brave grenadier liked to say to his comrades: "Let's stay calm. With me, Hu Xueman, the position cannot be lost." In the past, when people talked about heroic defense, they often said "live and die with the position." Now, the Volunteer Army soldiers' way of speaking has changed. This is the development of a new heroism, this is the invincible will of the Chinese people.

    Hu Xueman was a Shandong peasant by origin, and the soldiers' evaluation of him was that he was both intelligent and brave. When the attack began at dawn, the sky was still dark, and no one knew exactly where the enemy was. "The enemy is afraid of death," Hu Xueman thought, "they must be behind the ridgeline." He climbed to a stone cliff and heard people speaking below, at least two American soldiers. Hu Xueman quietly dropped a grenade, and both enemies were finished. When attacking the second hilltop, the enemy fired wildly from the hilltop fortifications. Hu Xueman climbed to a dozen meters from the side of the enemy's fortifications and threw another grenade. At this time, the enemy's firepower was so fierce that Hu Xueman later told reporters, "After you raise your arm to throw a grenade, if you don't quickly lower it, you don't know how many bullets you will be hit with at once." When attacking the third hilltop, star shells flew around Hu Xueman's body, making "chi-chi" sounds. Those who have fought know that when bullets make "chi-chi" sounds, they are about to graze the ears. Hu Xueman climbed and ran, never getting hit. Suddenly, a shell flew over, and Hu Xueman heard the sound was wrong, and quickly fell to the ground. Shrapnel lifted Hu Xueman's hat off, and Hu Xueman touched his head and felt nothing. Suddenly, another incendiary bomb exploded in front of him, oil splashing everywhere, burning Hu Xueman's face with a frightening blue light, numbness, soreness, and fire burning in his eyes. Hu Xueman grabbed two handfuls of accumulated snow and rubbed them on his face a few times, turned around and fought again. "The positions we have taken must never be allowed to be taken back by the enemy!" Hu Xueman and his comrades, like countless hard, unyielding rocks, shattered the enemy's countless counterattacks.

    By four o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy could no longer attack. The shadow of night warfare gradually enveloped them. The enemy began a general rout, and the Volunteer Army followed on their heels in pursuit. Attack, defend, and then a pursuit, the Volunteer Army stabilized its positions. The enemy's plans were completely shattered, leaving more than five hundred clumsy corpses near Hill 133.

    The soldiers were very happy to have won the battle. However, the regimental political commissar said, "Our work is just beginning. When will the approval of commendations be completed?" Of course, the regimental political commissar knew that the commendations could still be completed. When the American invading forces are completely driven out of Korea, the entire Volunteer Army will be credited, wouldn't that work be temporarily concluded?

　　“我们打出去！”
     ——汉江南岸战斗纪实之四
    本报记者  李庄
    在汉江南岸十八昼夜的阻击战中，中国人民志愿军不只进行顽强的防御作战，而且不断地用胜利出击来进行防御。当着敌人似乎还是气焰万丈的时候，志愿军的战士们非常坚决地说：“我们打出去！”在人员、装备均占绝对优势的敌人面前“打出去”，必须有超人的勇敢，高度的机智。中国人民志愿军，正是这种世界上最光辉的战士。
    二月四日，中国人民志愿军某部以一支精干的小部队，向窜入汉江南岸京安里以北一三三高地之敌主动出击，击溃美国侵略军二十四师一个联队，歼敌五百余人，创造了在防御中进攻的辉煌战例。
    汉江南岸的血战，已经持续了十天。美国侵略军日夜猛攻志愿军在京安里一带的山峦阵地。京安里阵地像一把尖刀，楔入敌阵数十里，把汉江东西两岸的敌人劈开（汉江至此作南北行）。美国人为了把自己的阵线拉直，拼命向这里攻击。
    开始，美国人摆的是正规作战的架子。先用几十架飞机狂炸，再用几十门大炮猛轰，然后用坦克掩护步兵冲锋。无数吨钢铁倾泻到志愿军的阵地上。草木被烧焦了，岩石被打碎了，积雪被烤化了，但是，敌人还是只能用望远镜看看志愿军的阵地。敌人久攻不下，被迫实行他们最最蹩脚的孤军偷袭。
    二月三日，美国二十四师团十九联队，全部轻装，从梨浦（骊州西北）出动，沿汉江向西北迂回，企图控制制高点，压垮志愿军这一片良好的阵地。下午，敌人占领了一三三、一四一、三九五、六三六等高地，距离驻在圣德里（京安里东北）的志愿军某部指挥所已经不远了。
    志愿军某部团指挥所中，这时进行着一件繁重的工作。团长、政治委员们正在“批功”。这个部队已经和敌人打了好几天，一个胜利接着一个胜利。战士们在紧张的战斗间隙评了功，这时送到团部请求批准。
    团长、政治委员、政治主任聚精会神地谈着想着。“批准那一个更合适呢？”按照下面送来的材料，应该立功的，几占总人数的三分之一。平心而论，三分之一的数字并不算多，如果按照一般的标准衡量，显然大家都可以算英雄。但是，在朝鲜战地评功批功，是要在英雄之中选英雄，所以，团长们必须格外的慎重。
    听到电话员关于敌情的报告，团长们这才站起身来。
    “这个工作暂时可以结束了。”团长说。
    “可以暂时结束了，”政治委员呼了一口长气，慢慢地说：“不过，打完这一仗，这个工作将是更加繁重的。多少英雄，又要立多少功啊！”
    战士们听说出击，长期积累的疲劳立刻烟消云散。谁都知道，当着我们出击的时候，敌人的飞机大炮将要失掉作用，敌人在进攻中的主动将要变成被动，我们要打那里就打那里，我们将以最小的代价，换取敌人重大的损失。
    二连奉命攻击一三三高地。这个连要钻入敌人群中，乘敌人不备，打它个措手不及。
    二连协同兄弟部队出发时，天已经黑了。群山之中，夜幕特别浓密，伸手不见五指。经过三十里的山间急行军，战士们的汗水浸透棉衣，凝成一层白花花的霜雪。参加出击的病号一手拄着棍子，一手拿着出弦的手榴弹。谁都想在即将到来的战斗中，争取新的、更大的荣誉。
    天将拂晓，二连到达一三三高地。高地附近一片死寂，敌人还在梦中。
    一三三高地是一片多石少树的光山。高地上有五个小山头，敌人都作了野战工事。五个山头相距不远，火力可以互相支援。
    二连七班充任尖刀班。八个战士分成三路，在长满小灌木和多刺荆棘的陡坡上慢慢爬行。在这夜间的接敌近战中，战士们都是独立作战，隐蔽运动到敌人的阵地前沿，向敌人投掷手榴弹。敌人被打得哇哇怪叫，完全被我们搅乱了。二连连续攻占了三个山头。
    这就是志愿军进行的夜间战斗。队伍出发时，上级动员说：“抓住敌人就是胜利。”战士们深深懂得，只要我们出现在敌人的面前，冲到手榴弹的威力圈内，敌人不是被歼（指被打死），就是就俘。“这时候”，战士们说：“我们的手榴弹，就能完全压倒敌人的榴弹炮。”
    打到第四个山头，敌人的抵抗逐渐加强。这时天已渐明，敌人得到炮兵的有力援助。经过一点多钟的前哨战，敌人的纵深兵力已经集结。三个山头的丧失，已使敌人慢慢清醒过来，如果继续退却，昨天的“突击”就要“前功尽弃”了。
    七班打下三个山头，自己也有了相当的伤亡。八班奉命增援七班。敌人欺负我们人少，连续发起反冲锋。志愿军坚决前进。打到第五个山头时，八班长冲在最前面。跑到山半腰，突然从石缝中钻出两个美国兵，气势汹汹地向他扑过来。八班长端起卡宾枪向敌人射击，枪口没有任何声息。子弹早已打光了，而敌人冲到面前了。八班长举起卡宾枪，向前头一个敌人打去。枪身打在钢盔上，火星四溅，敌人应声而倒。第二个美国兵紧接着冲到跟前，就要举枪射击。八班长对准敌人的肚子猛踢一脚，敌人怪叫两声，一溜烟滚下山去。八班长用力过猛，自己也跌了一跤。
    像这样的生死搏斗，一直继续了好久。天大明时，二连占领了一三三高地上的五个小山头。
    从四日拂晓开始，一三三高地附近的群山之中，到处是枪声和杀声。二连的兄弟部队，正在分别消灭敌人。太阳出山的时候，六架美国侦察机沿着山头低飞，侦察那里是他们的人，那里是我们的人。经过一场混战，敌人完全被我们打乱了。
    四日整整一天，敌人集中全部力量，向一三三高地疯狂反扑。窜到一三三高地以北的敌人，也慢慢向后收缩。二连的环境越来越险恶。
    这时开始了一种新形式的战斗，敌人把它全部的本事都使出来了。飞机对着每一个山头轰炸扫射，谁也数不清敌机共有多少架。排炮集中轰击，方圆十几步就有一颗炮弹爆炸，山被打成麻子，雪地变成黑地，随手一摸，就能拾起几块弹片。现在可说是一种意志的比赛，敌人窜到我们阵地以内，我们钻入敌人群中，谁能坚持到底，胜利将是谁的。比赛的结果完全和过去一样，敌人仍然失败了。
    在这里，多少战士立下了不朽的功绩。团政治委员十分了解他的战士，他在批功暂告结束时说的话是完全对的。像机枪射手于同来，一挺枪打死二十二个敌人，在战斗最最激烈的时候，他拿着机枪当步枪射击。敌人冲到百米以内，他开始实行单发点射。敌人溃退了，又瞄准敌人的屁股连发。有好几次，敌人藏在岩石的死角下面，他跳出工事，端着枪打。有好几次，敌人的炮弹把他的工事掀翻，他转移到工事旁边的炸弹坑中，继续向敌人射击。敌人至少有三挺机枪对付他，但未损害他一根头发。
    机枪射手马占奎的遭遇，似乎比于同来坏一些。但他杀伤的敌人，却比于同来多些。敌人的第四次冲锋，由密集的炮火掩护着。一发炮弹落在马占奎的工事近旁，两个战士倒在地上，战友的热血溅了他一脸。马占奎咬紧牙关继续射击，打倒一片又一片的敌人以后，弹药手负伤了，一挺枪剩下一个人。以后弹药打光了，马占奎剩下一挺空枪，仍然咬紧牙关，继续坚持。以后，在一些稀有的战斗间隙中，马占奎爬到阵地前沿，捡到两箱敌人丢下的子弹，继续射击。以后，马占奎负了重伤，但他继续在阵地上坚持。他知道，在这种生死决斗关头，自己如果走下火线，必然拖住一两个正在射击敌人的战友。以后，直到把敌人打退了，马占奎才被战友们背下山来。
    在夜间出击时，胡学蛮始终冲在前面。在白天防御时，胡学蛮始终守在前面。这个英勇无双的投弹手喜欢对同志们说：“咱们沉住气，有我胡学蛮，阵地是丢不了的。”过去人们谈到英勇的防御，常常说“与阵地共存亡”，现在，志愿军战士的说法已经改变了，这是新英雄主义的发展，这是中国人民不可战胜的意志。
    胡学蛮是个贫农出身的山东人，战士们对他的评语是智勇兼备。拂晓攻击的时候，天空还是黑的，谁也不知道敌人到底在那里。“敌人怕死”，胡学蛮想道：“一定在棱线后头。”他爬到一个石崖上面，听到下面有人哇啦哇啦地说话，至少有两个美国兵。胡学蛮悄悄地丢下一个手榴弹，两个敌人都完了。打到第二个山头，敌人从山顶工事中疯狂射击。胡学蛮爬到敌人工事侧面十几米处，又是一颗手榴弹。这时敌人的火力是这样猛，胡学蛮事后对记者说：“你抬起胳膊甩手榴弹后，如果不赶紧放下来，不知道一下子要打上几粒子弹。”打到第三个山头，星光弹围着胡学蛮的身子乱飞，“吃吃”直叫。打过仗的人都知道，子弹“吃吃”地叫，就是快擦到耳朵上了。胡学蛮时爬时跑，始终没有被打着。突然，一颗炮弹飞过来，胡学蛮听着声音不对，赶紧栽到地上。弹片掀走胡学蛮的帽子，胡学蛮用手摸摸脑袋，没有什么事。突然，又有一颗燃烧弹在眼前炸开，油液四溅，胡学蛮的脸上烧起怕人的蓝光，麻木、酸痛、眼中冒火。胡学蛮抓起两把积雪，在脸上擦了几把，转身再战。“我们拿下的阵地，决不能再让敌人夺回去！”胡学蛮和他的战友像无数坚硬不拔的岩石，粉碎了敌人无数次的反击。
    打到下午四时，敌人实在攻不动了。夜战的阴影逐渐笼罩了他们。敌人开始总溃退，志愿军于是跟着它的屁股追击。出击、防御、再一个追击，志愿军稳住了自己的阵地。敌人的企图全被粉碎，在一三三高地附近，遗下五百多蠢笨的尸体。
    打了胜仗，战士们大高兴。不过，团政治委员说：“我们的工作还在开始。批功，什么时候能够批完呢？”当然，团政治委员知道，功还是可以批完的。当着美国侵略军彻底被驱出朝鲜的时候，志愿军全体都记一功，这个工作不是就可以暂时结束了么？
