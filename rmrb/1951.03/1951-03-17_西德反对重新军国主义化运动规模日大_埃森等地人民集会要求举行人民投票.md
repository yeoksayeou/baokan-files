Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Berlin Dispatch: People in various parts of West Germany have been holding rallies to oppose remilitarization and to demand a referendum on this issue, as well as the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany this year.

In Essen, the center of the Ruhr industrial area, the Free German Youth League convened a demonstration on the 11th against remilitarization. The Bonn government, terrified by this popular protest, dispatched a large number of police to attack, resulting in injuries to many demonstrators. The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League has sent a letter to the Bonn "Minister of Interior" Lehr, expressing a strong protest. The protest letter emphasized that the police's brutality proves that all actions against West German remilitarization strike at the most sensitive spot of those who are preparing for war for the United States in Europe. However, despite the bloody suppression, German youth will strengthen the struggle for peace and against West German remilitarization, and will drive away all those who rearm Germany and oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

In Stuttgart, 2,500 people held a peace conference in the Main Square. Hundreds of people from various political parties signed a protest against Adenauer's current policies on the spot.

In Bremen, over a thousand residents held a peace conference on the 12th. The conference passed a resolution to be sent to the Bonn "government," urging a referendum on the issue of West German remilitarization. The resolution stated: "We believe that the Bonn government has no right to pass arbitrary resolutions on the issue of remilitarization."

After progressive trade union leaders in West Germany revealed last weekend that 1,500 enterprises in West Germany will begin working for the military industry, West German workers have launched an even larger struggle against remilitarization. Representatives of 16,000 workers in Esslingen demanded a referendum on the issue of remilitarization. Construction workers in Duisburg decided to hold a referendum on the issue of remilitarization at their trade union's annual meeting. Workers participating in the "Aviation Technology Association" warned Adenauer that 97 percent of the workers in their enterprises oppose remilitarization. A representative meeting of young miners held in Gelsenkirchen protested against remilitarization and the resulting overtime work in the coal mines.

The "Study Group on All-German Issues," composed of well-known cultural workers and scientists in Hamburg, recently called Adenauer's policy against unification a "treasonous policy" and demanded Adenauer's resignation. West German reactionaries are now trying to undermine the referendum by all means. The Minister of the Interior of South Württemberg has ordered a ban on voting in Schweningen, but even Madlener, a city councilor of the Christian Democratic Union (Adenauer's party) in the city, said that this exposes the government's fear of public opinion.

　　西德反对重新军国主义化运动规模日大
    埃森等地人民集会要求举行人民投票
    【新华社十六日讯】柏林消息：西德各地人民纷纷举行集会，反对重新军国主义化，并要求就此举行人民投票和在今年缔结对德和约。
    在鲁尔工业区中心埃森，自由德国青年联盟在十一日召开了反对重新军国主义化的示威大会。在人民这种抗议面前惊慌万分的波恩政府竟出动大批警察予以袭击，致示威者多人受伤。自由德国青年联盟中央委员会为此已致书波恩“内政部长”勒尔，表示严重抗议。抗议书中着重指出：警察的暴行证明：一切反对西德重新军国主义化的行动，都打中了那些在欧洲为美国准备战争的人们的最痛处。但是，尽管有血腥的镇压，德国青年仍将加强争取和平和反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争，并将把一切重新武装德国及在一九五一年反对缔结对德和约的人们赶走。
    在斯图加特，有二千五百人在美因广场举行了和平大会。数百名各政党的人士当场签名抗议阿登纳的现行政策。
    在不来梅，有一千余居民十二日举行了和平大会。大会通过了一项送交波恩“政府”的决议，敦促就西德重新军国主义化一事举行人民投票。决议称：“我们认为波恩政府无权就重新军国主义化问题通过武断的决议。”
    在西德进步工会领袖于上周末揭露西德有一千五百个企业将开始为军事工业工作以后，西德工人已因此展开了更大规模的反对重新军国主义化的斗争。埃斯林根一万六千工人的代表要求就重新军国主义化一事举行人民投票。杜伊斯堡的建筑工人决定在他们工会的年会上就重新军国主义化的问题举行人民投票。参加“航空技术协会”的工人警告阿登纳说：在他们的企业中有百分之九十七的工人反对重新军国主义化。在盖尔森基亨举行的青年矿工代表会议抗议重新军国主义化和因此而在煤矿中实行加班制。
    由汉堡著名的文化工作者和科学工作者组成的“全德问题研究会”最近也将阿登纳反对统一的政策称为“卖国政策”，并要求阿登纳辞职。西德反动派现在正想以一切办法破坏人民投票，南瓦登堡州的内政部长已下令禁止在什温宁根举行投票，但是连该市基督教民主党（阿登纳的党）的市参议员马德勒纳也说：这暴露了政府对舆论的恐惧。
