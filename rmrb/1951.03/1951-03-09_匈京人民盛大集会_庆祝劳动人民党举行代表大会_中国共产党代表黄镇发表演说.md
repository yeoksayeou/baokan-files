　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: The Budapest Party Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a grand mass rally in Heroes' Square in Budapest on the 24th to celebrate the opening of the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party. Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, delivered a speech at the meeting, stating that the love and dedication of millions of working people to the Party is the source of our infinite strength. This gathering of the working people of Budapest is a demonstration of their love for the motherland and progressive humanity, and also a great internationalist demonstration in the struggle to defend peace. Rakosi pointed out that the Congress is being held at a time when the first year's tasks of the Five-Year Plan have been successfully completed, and when Hungary's industrial production has exceeded that of 1949 by 35 percent. These achievements have enabled us to greatly raise the goals of the Five-Year Plan and the material and cultural living standards of the people. Rakosi finally declared that the Hungarian people love peace. The Hungarian working people unanimously support Comrade Stalin's speech, they love their motherland, and they are prepared to fight with all their strength and blood to defend peace and freedom, and a better future for socialism, and to oppose all imperialist aggression.
    Huang Zhen, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a speech stating that the working classes and working people of China and Hungary are fighting side by side against imperialism. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, in the spirit of internationalism and patriotism, are assisting their Korean brothers in a just struggle and have given the American aggressors a decisive blow. Undoubtedly, if the American aggressors do not withdraw from Korea, the heroic Chinese and Korean people will wipe out the invaders completely.
    Choe Chang-ik, representative of the Korean Workers' Party, said in his speech that Comrade Stalin's speech has further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in final victory. Neither air fortresses, nor jet bombers, nor atomic bombs can shake the spirit of patriotic people fighting for freedom and independence. If the American imperialists still do not understand the will of the Korean people to fight to the end for victory, we will force them to understand, and the later they understand, the greater their defeat will be.
    Billoux, representative of the French Communist Party and member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, said in his speech that we are carrying out the movement against the rearmament of West Germany in accordance with the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on the unity of the world's proletariat. We want to protect the young German Democratic Republic and sincerely unite those who do not want West Germany to become an American colony, an American barracks, and a fortress against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. We want to expose the Tito gang and the criminals who live by inciting new wars. The French proletariat and the French people will strive to fulfill the sacred task of defending peace.

    中国共产党代表黄镇发表演说
    【新华社讯】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利劳动人民党布达佩斯党委会为庆祝匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会的开幕，于二十四日在布达佩斯英雄广场举行盛大的群众大会。匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西在会上发表演说称：数百万劳动人民对党的热爱和献身，是我们的无穷力量的泉源。布达佩斯劳动人民的这一次集会，是他们表示对祖国和进步人类的热爱，也是为保卫和平而斗争的国际主义的大示威。拉科西指出：代表大会是在五年计划第一年任务胜利完成时举行的，是在匈牙利工业生产已超过一九四九年百分之三十五的时候举行的。这些成绩已使我们能大大地提高五年计划的目标和人民物质生活水平与文化水平。拉科西最后宣称：匈牙利人民是爱好和平的。匈牙利劳动人民一致拥护斯大林同志的谈话，他们热爱自己的祖国，他们准备以全力和热血为保卫和平与自由及社会主义的更美好的将来，为反对一切帝国主义者的侵袭而斗争。
    中国共产党代表黄镇发表演说称：中匈两国工人阶级与劳动人民正并肩为反对帝国主义而斗争。英勇的中国人民志愿军正本着国际主义和爱国主义的精神，在正义的斗争中援助着朝鲜兄弟们，并已给予美国侵略者以决定性的打击。无疑的，假如美国侵略者不退出朝鲜，英勇的中朝人民将把侵略者消灭净尽。
    朝鲜劳动党代表崔昌益致词称：斯大林同志的谈话使朝鲜人民对于最后胜利的信心更加增强了。无论空中堡垒、喷火式轰炸机或原子弹都不能动摇为自由与独立而战斗的爱国人民的精神。假如美帝国主义直到现在还不了解朝鲜人民将为胜利而战斗到底的意志，我们将迫使他们来了解，他们了解得越迟，失败也就越大。
    法国共产党代表、法共政治局委员比劳致词称：我们正本着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的全世界无产阶级团结一致的教言，进行着反对武装西德的运动。我们要保护年青的德意志民主共和国，并真诚地团结那些不愿使西德沦为美国殖民地，不愿西德成为美国兵营及反对苏联和人民民主国家的堡垒的人。我们要揭发铁托匪帮和以煽动新战争为生的罪犯们。法国无产阶级与法国人民将努力完成保卫和平的神圣任务。
