    Economic Life Trends

    Prior to May of last year, the dyeing and weaving industry in Changzhou City, Southern Jiangsu, was in a state of intermittent or complete shutdown due to capital shortages in all 64 factories. Starting in May, the People's Government supported the factories through commissioned weaving, and the production situation of each factory subsequently improved, with output increasing month by month and product quality also improving. The industry's Joint Operations Office sold products with the unified trademarks "Gonglian" and "Baolian Deng" to the Northeast and Northwest regions, which were well received. As a result, the factories obtained surpluses and expanded their capital. For example, the original capital of Zhiyuan Cloth Factory was equivalent to 446 bundles of yarn, but now it has 682 bundles, a surplus of 236 bundles. Yongdasheng Zhenji, which had very little capital, originally had 12 bundles of yarn, but now has 36 bundles, a surplus of twice the original capital. Therefore, other commercial capital and wealthy households have invested capital in the dyeing and weaving industry, and by the end of December last year, 37 new factories had been opened.
  
  Yunnan Tea Production Gradually Recovers
    Shunning, Jingdong in western Yunnan, and Fo Hai, and other 20 counties in southern Yunnan are one of the major tea producing areas in the southwest. The large-leaf black tea produced here enjoys an international reputation. The annual output of the whole area once reached 250,000 dan at its peak. However, under the extreme destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries for several years, the annual output of the whole area in 1949 was only more than 200 dan. After liberation, the Yunnan Branch of the State-owned China Tea Company strongly supported it through purchase. Last year, it purchased 1.26 million jin of various teas at a price more than doubled, and more than 200,000 tea farmers in the whole area received reasonable income, which greatly improved the mood of production. Last year, the annual output of the area reached more than 16,700 dan, an increase of 80 times compared with 1949.

    常州染织业获得盈余日趋发展
    苏南常州市的染织业在去年五月以前，全市六十四家厂由于资金短绌，处于随开随停或全部停工的状态。五月份起，人民政府用代织方式扶助各厂，各厂生产情况随即好转，产量逐月增加，产品质量也有提高。该业联营处，曾以统一商标“工联”及“宝莲灯”牌子的产品远销东北、西北各地，均得到好评。各厂由此获得了盈余扩大了资金。如志远布厂原有资金合四四六件纱，现已有六八二件，盈余了二三六件；资金很小的永大盛振记原有资金十二件纱，现有纱三十六件，盈余达资金二倍。因此，其他商业资本及殷实富户便纷纷把资金投向染织业，到去年十二月底计已增开工厂三十七家。
  云南茶叶产量逐渐恢复
    云南西部的顺宁、景东和云南南部的佛海等二十余县是西南主要产茶区之一，所产以大叶种红茶负有国际盛誉，全区年产量最高时曾达二十五万担，但在国民党反动派数年来的极度摧残下，一九四九年全区年产量只有二百余担。解放后，国营中国茶业公司云南分公司通过收购大力扶植，去年全年以提高一倍以上的茶价收购了各种茶叶达一百二十六万余斤，全区二十余万茶农得到了合理的收益，生产情绪大为提高。去年该区年产量已达到一万六千七百余担，较一九四九年增加了八十倍。
