　　Popularize the Patriotic Compact Movement
    In the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and the mass movement to eliminate and prevent traitors, many places have initiated and promoted the patriotic compact movement. This is a very good way to consolidate the achievements of the patriotic movement, and it should be universally promoted among people from all walks of life across the country.
    Currently, the movement to establish patriotic compacts is unfolding in major cities across the country and in some small and medium-sized cities and certain rural areas. Some cities have begun to penetrate into neighborhoods and factory workshops and groups. In Shanghai alone, in addition to the common patriotic compact of people from all walks of life in the city, twenty industrial trade unions and thousands of grassroots trade unions have separately established patriotic compacts; more than 10,000 alleys in the city have either established or are in the process of establishing patriotic compacts; government agencies, organizations, schools, and shops have also formulated different patriotic compacts. In other places, there are also many people's organizations that have established patriotic compacts. The patriotic compacts established in various places generally include two types of content. One type of content is common, mainly expressing the people's support for Chairman Mao, the People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army, expressing support for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's actions to resist America and aid Korea, and the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, and expressing opposition to US imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and the rearmament of Japan. The other type of content in the compacts is related to the specific work of people in various regions and industries, such as workers and farmers striving to increase production, government employees striving to work, merchants striving for urban-rural exchanges, actively paying taxes, and opposing speculation. Through these patriotic compacts, people from all walks of life in various places have combined their high patriotic enthusiasm with specific work, thus creating many great achievements. For example, the foundry department of a company in Shanghai created seventeen new records in a row in the week of late February. In Jinan, the quality of work in various municipal government agencies has significantly improved in fulfilling the patriotic compacts. Some proofreaders only found one mistake in 160,000 words. In many places, the industrial and commercial sectors initiated challenge competitions and parades to pay taxes, all taking pride in being the first taxpayers, with enthusiastic and unprecedented situations. Now, most industrial and commercial households in Shanghai have already paid their February business tax, and Zhenjiang City has paid off more than 2 billion in overdue taxes. This shows the enormous role that the establishment and implementation of patriotic compacts play in our country's current political movements and various specific tasks.
    However, as of now, the development of the patriotic compact movement is still uneven. Generally speaking, large cities are better than small and medium-sized cities, and small and medium-sized cities are better than rural areas, and even within cities, the levels are still uneven between various classes. Even in the patriotic compacts that have been established, the content is also uneven. Some patriotic compacts are only drafted by a few activists; some patriotic compacts do not relate to the actual situation of people in various regions and industries, and are often some unrealistic slogans; some compacts put forward excessive and incorrect demands, such as "guaranteeing the elimination of non-proletarian ideological consciousness" in general schools. Therefore, while striving to promote patriotic compacts throughout the country, we must pay attention to making the content of patriotic compacts specific in every word, feasible in every clause, with conditions that are neither too high nor too low, with the characteristics of different regions and units, and indeed the result of mass discussion. After establishing a patriotic compact, it is necessary to focus on specific and central projects to implement. It is necessary to correct the practices of setting it aside after establishment, or being tight at the beginning and loose at the end, or being satisfied with a little bit of achievement without seriously and comprehensively promoting it.
    After the Central People's Government announced the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries and various places launched the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the mass movement to eliminate and prevent traitors is becoming a new and important component of the patriotic movement. Therefore, at present, whether establishing or implementing patriotic compacts, it should be linked to the movement to eliminate and prevent traitors that the masses are concerned about; and on the other hand, the propaganda of eliminating and preventing traitors should also be linked to resisting America and aiding Korea, to protecting state property, and safeguarding state secrets, so as to generate a broader political education role.

### 普及爱国公约运动

　　普及爱国公约运动
    在抗美援朝运动和群众性的除奸防奸运动中，许多地方发起和推广了爱国公约运动。这是巩固爱国运动成果的一个很好的方法，应该争取在全国各地各界人民中加以普遍推广。
    目前订立爱国公约的运动，正向全国各大城市和一部分中小城市以及某些乡村中展开，某些城市已开始向里弄和工厂的车间、小组深入。仅上海一地，除了全市各界人民共同的爱国公约以外，已有二十个产业工会和几千个基层工会分别订立了爱国公约；全市一万多条里弄，都已经或正在订立爱国公约；机关、团体、学校、商店也各自订出不同的爱国公约。其他地方，订立爱国公约的人民团体也很多。各地所订爱国公约，一般包括两类内容。一类内容是共同性的，主要是表示人民对于毛主席、人民政府、中国共产党、人民解放军的拥护，表示对于中国人民志愿军抗美援朝行动以及人民政府镇压反革命活动的支持，表示对于美帝国主义侵略台湾，重新武装日本的反对等。公约中的另一类内容是与各地区各行业人民的具体工作相联系的，例如工人、农民努力提高生产，机关职员努力工作，商人努力于城乡交流，踊跃纳税，反对投机等等。经过这些爱国公约，各地各界人民把高度的爱国热情与具体工作结合起来，因而创造了许多伟大的成绩。例如上海某公司某厂翻砂部在二月下旬的一周内，就连续创造十七项新纪录。济南市市级各机关在履行爱国公约中，工作质量显著提高。有的校对人员看十六万字仅错一字。不少地方的工商界在缴纳税款时，发起挑战竞赛游行纳税运动，都以争得第一个纳税人为荣，情况热烈，前所未有。现在上海市的绝大部分工商户早已将二月份的营业税缴清，镇江市缴清了二十多亿的拖欠税款。这就说明，订立与履行爱国公约对于我们国家当前的政治运动以及各项具体工作有着怎样巨大的作用。
    但是，截至目前为止，订立爱国公约运动的发展还是不平衡的。一般说，大城市较中小城市为好，中小城市较乡村为好，而在城市中，各阶层之间也还不平衡。就在已订立的爱国公约中，其内容也是不平衡的。有些爱国公约只是少数积极分子包办代替拟定的；有些爱国公约并不联系各地各界人民的实际，往往是一些不着边际的口号；有些公约提出了过高的和错误的要求，例如在一般学校里提出“保证肃清非无产阶级思想意识”之类。因此，在努力把爱国公约推广到全国的时候，必须注意使爱国公约的内容，字字具体，条条可行，所提条件既不过高，也不过低，有不同地区不同单位的特色，而且确实是群众讨论的结果。订了爱国公约之后，必须抓紧具体的和中心的项目来实行。订了就搁置不问，或者前紧后松，或者满足于一点一滴的成绩，而没有认真地全面地去推行，都是应该纠正的。
    在中央人民政府公布惩治反革命条例，各地展开镇压反革命的斗争以后，群众性的除奸防奸运动，正在变成为爱国运动中的一个新的重要成份。因此，目前无论订立爱国公约或实施爱国公约，都应当与群众所正在关心的除奸防奸运动联系起来；而另一方面，也应当把除奸防奸的宣传联系到抗美援朝，联系到爱护国家财产，保守国家机密，使它发生更广泛的政治教育作用。
