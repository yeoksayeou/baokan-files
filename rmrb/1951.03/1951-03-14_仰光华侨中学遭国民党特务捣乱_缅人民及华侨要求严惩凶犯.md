Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Rangoon Dispatch: The Overseas Chinese schools, Nanyang High School and Xinqiao High School in Rangoon were disrupted by Kuomintang remnant bandits' secret agents on March 1st and 2nd. Four teachers and students from the two schools were beaten and injured. This despicable and shameless act of violence by Kuomintang secret agents aroused angry protests from the broad masses of the Burmese people and overseas Chinese communities. The All Burma Students' Union, on behalf of all Burmese students, wrote letters to the two schools expressing condolences. The letter stated: We strongly condemn the crime of the thugs under the direction of the Kuomintang who beat people at Nanyang High School. We will ask the relevant authorities to take strict measures to prevent such crimes from happening again and demand that the culprits be punished. The Burmese-language "Guide Daily" pointed out that the Burmese government has established diplomatic relations with New China, and disrespecting New China is tantamount to disrespecting itself. The newspaper demanded that the Burmese government not relax its efforts on this matter. All sectors of the overseas Chinese community have gone to express their condolences to the injured teachers and students and unanimously demanded that the Burmese government must severely punish the culprits in order to safeguard the safety of the overseas Chinese.
