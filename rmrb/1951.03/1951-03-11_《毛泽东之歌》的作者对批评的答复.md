To the Editor:

Today I read Comrade Zhou Weizhi's article "A Brief Discussion on the Creation of Songs Praising Chairman Mao" in the 87th issue of *People's Literature*. I completely agree with his views on "Ode to Mao Zedong," a song I co-authored with Comrade Lu Su. Many of the shortcomings he pointed out were things we felt when we wrote this piece before "July 1st" in 1941. During the rectification campaign in 1943, I also conducted a self-criticism of this song, and my views were basically consistent with those in Comrade Weizhi's article. After a full decade, I feel uneasy whenever I hear people still singing this song. It has become a mental burden for me, and it grows heavier day by day. Although I have thought about rewriting a new song, my thoughts and feelings are still very immature, so I have never dared to put pen to paper. I sincerely hope that a new song will replace it. I think the reason people are still singing it now is not because it is good, but because there is an urgent need for a song to express love and respect for the leader. I myself am still willing to work hard in this regard.

The People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory once recorded this song on a record. In order to prevent it from being further promoted, I have asked the People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory to stop issuing it. Thank you.

Editor's Note: In addition to the People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory ceasing distribution of this song, radio stations in various locations should immediately stop broadcasting it.

### 《毛泽东之歌》的作者对批评的答复

专栏：读者来信

　　《毛泽东之歌》的作者对批评的答复编辑同志：
    今天读到《人民文艺》第八十七期所载周巍峙同志《略谈歌颂毛主席的歌曲创作》一文。我完全同意他对我和卢肃同志合作的《毛泽东之歌》的意见。他所指出的许多缺点，是一九四一年“七一”前写成这个作品时我们就感到了的。一九四三年整风时，我对这支歌曲也曾进行检讨，和巍峙同志这篇文章的意见基本上也是一致的。经过整整十年，每当听到人们还在唱这支歌时，内心实在不安，它成了我的一个精神负担，并且一天比一天沉重。虽然也曾想重写一支新歌，但思想感情很不成熟，始终未敢落笔。我衷心地希望有新的歌曲来代替它。我想，现在人们还在唱它，并不是因为它好，而是迫切需要一支歌来表达对领袖的敬爱。我自己也仍愿在这方面努力。
    这支歌人民广播器材厂曾灌过唱片，为了不使它再推广，我已请人民广播器材厂停止发行。谢谢你们。
        张春桥二月五日，上海
    编者按：这个歌曲，除人民广播器材厂停止发行外，各地广播电台应即停止播送。
