　　Liberated Women of Various Ethnic Groups in the Northwest
     Hu Jun
    The Northwest is a multi-ethnic region. In addition to the Han ethnic group, there are nearly twenty ethnic minorities including Uyghur, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Mongolian, Tu, Kirgiz, Sibe, Salar, Russian, Uzbek, Solon, Manchu, Tajik and Tatar. The nearly seven million people of various ethnic minorities account for about a quarter of the total population of the Northwest (26.5 million). As a result of the reactionary rule of successive feudal dynasties and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, disunity among ethnic groups, especially between the Han and other ethnic minorities, was created. This situation was fundamentally changed only after the People's Liberation Army marched into and liberated the Great Northwest in 1949, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    The Northwest's fraternal ethnic groups have shaken off thousands of years of ethnic oppression and feudal rule, which is of particular significance to the women who account for half of the population of these fraternal ethnic groups. Generally speaking, due to the relatively backward political, economic, and cultural development and deep religious beliefs of these fraternal ethnic groups, the feudal abuses and suffering endured by the women of these fraternal ethnic groups are more profound and severe than those of Han women. However, since the Great Northwest was liberated, the women of the Northwest's fraternal ethnic groups have begun to stand up. Over the past year, under the leadership and assistance of the people's governments at all levels in the Northwest, the women of various ethnic groups have been initially organized. Women's organizations representing the interests of the broad masses of women of various ethnic groups—democratic women's federations at all levels—have been established in various places. The broad masses of women of various ethnic groups have risen to participate in various social activities, government work, and production campaigns, and actively participate in learning, demanding to improve their culture.
  I. Democratic Women's Federations Established One After Another in Northwest, Broad Masses of Women of Various Ethnic Groups Initially Organized.
    According to incomplete statistics, in addition to the Northwest Democratic Women's Federation, among the women's organizations of various ethnic groups in the Northwest, the Urumqi City Democratic Women's Federation was established in May 1950 in Xinjiang. In Xinjiang Province, three prefectures and forty-five counties and cities have successively established democratic women's federations or preparatory committees for democratic women's federations including women of various ethnic groups. In Gansu, the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, including more than three million women from five ethnic groups (Han, Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Dongxiang) throughout the province, was officially established in October last year after the convening of the first provincial women's congress; Lanzhou City established its city democratic women's federation as early as April last year. In Ningxia, the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, including the Hui and Han ethnic groups, was officially established in September last year; Yinchuan City established its city democratic women's federation in July last year. Qinghai Province and Xining City also successively established provincial and municipal democratic women's federations including five ethnic groups (Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Tu) throughout the province in June and July last year.
    The preparation and establishment of these women's organizations have received the active guidance and encouragement of responsible comrades of local people's governments at all levels and the Chinese Communist Party, and they have been given assistance in many ways, thus enabling the development of women's work to obtain favorable conditions.
    Secondly, representatives of women of various fraternal nationalities have been widely absorbed to participate in various organs of political power and mass organizations such as people's representative conferences at all levels, peasant representative conferences, and youth representative conferences. They work, engage in activities, participate in elections, serve as representatives, and serve as government cadres alongside men; they have obtained democratic political rights and are no longer appendages of men. They have all shown enthusiasm and zeal in participating in these activities and work. The broad masses of women of the Northwest's fraternal ethnic groups have gradually shaken off the shackles of feudal forces in the old society and have begun to step out of their families. Their work is no longer limited to doing trivial things in the family such as "cooking and boiling rice, raising children and holding eggs, sewing clothes and mending rags." They have indeed been liberated.
  II. Women of Various Ethnic Groups Participate in Labor Production, Improving Their Status in the Family and in Society.
    The women of various ethnic groups in the Northwest have a glorious tradition of loving labor and production. After the liberation of the Northwest, the women of various ethnic groups have realized that in the new society, in a country where the people are their own masters, everyone should participate in labor, and laboring people are the most glorious. At the same time, they have also realized that if women want to achieve complete liberation in politics and culture, it is impossible to do so without first seeking economic liberation. And to achieve economic liberation, they must participate in labor production. Therefore, the democratic women's federations in various places have also designated mobilizing women to participate in labor production as one of their central tasks.
    According to existing materials, last year in six prefectures including Kashi, Urumqi, Shache, Aksu, Yanqi, and Urumqi City in Xinjiang, a total of more than 490,000 women of various ethnic groups participated in production movements such as repairing canals, reclaiming wasteland, and harvesting autumn crops. During the movement, a large number of activists and labor models emerged. More than 8,000 women in Kashi Prefecture reclaimed wasteland, cultivating more than 7,000 mu of wasteland. More than 12,900 women of various ethnic groups in Urumqi City participated in the construction of the Urumqi River dike. They dug earth in the water like men, and eight people were selected as labor models.
    Many rural women organized mutual aid production groups, developed household sideline occupations, and earned wages and income. In this way, husbands who generally looked down on women and thought that women were "useless" were also happy, thereby increasing the feelings between husband and wife and improving the status of women in the family and in society.
    In the process of mobilizing and organizing women of various ethnic groups to participate in labor production, the ethnic discrimination and estrangement that had existed for a long time among women of different ethnic groups were eliminated, and the unity among the people of all ethnic groups was promoted. For example, in rural areas of Ningxia Province, women of the Hui and Han ethnic groups did not interact with each other in the past, and would quarrel at the slightest disagreement, but since liberation, with the establishment of village women's associations, this phenomenon no longer exists.
  III. Women of Various Ethnic Groups Actively Participate in Learning, Improving Their Political Awareness and Cultural Level.
    Under the oppression and shackles of feudal society in the past, women of all ethnic groups were unable to obtain opportunities to learn culture. In the old society, generally men, and even including women themselves, many people believed that women should "not go out of the front door, nor step out of the second door," abide by the feudal morality of "three obediences and four virtues," saying that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue," "what does a woman understand, there's nothing to learn," etc., so it was extremely rare for women to learn culture. Taking Shufu County, the cultural center of southern Xinjiang, as an example, the county has a total of 126,450 women. According to statistics from local cultural and educational institutions at the beginning of last year, the situation of education was: only 130 female students in secondary schools, and only 3,938 female students in primary schools, with the remaining more than 97% being illiterate.
    However, since women gained political liberation, participated in various social and political activities, and participated in labor production, they have actively demanded to improve their culture. After the liberation of the Great Northwest, in order to meet this urgent demand of women of all ethnic groups, with the help and planning of the people's governments at all levels and the democratic women's federations at all levels, many women's literacy groups and literacy classes were established, and the broad masses of women of various ethnic groups were swept into a wave of learning.
    According to statistics from the Xi'an Masses Daily in October last year, there were more than 600 women's literacy classes in various counties and cities in Xinjiang, with more than 188,000 women of various ethnic groups participating in learning. Under the efforts of the Urumqi City Democratic Women's Federation and the Municipal People's Government Education Section, with primary schools as the main stronghold, 31 women's literacy classes were established throughout the city, with 904 housewives participating in cultural learning. The City Democratic Women's Federation reprinted 1,500 copies of "Workers, Peasants, and Laboring Women's Textbooks," mimeographed 1,300 copies of textbooks in Uyghur, and also set up a reading room, equipped with books in both Uyghur and Han languages for women to read.
    The enthusiasm of women in various places for learning is unprecedentedly high: active, serious, and hardworking. For example, women in Xinyuan Township, Huzhu County, Qinghai, share their learning experiences with each other, propose that learning should maintain a certain pace, recognize at least three new characters every day, hold regular competitions, and mobilize and introduce their family members and neighbors to participate in cultural learning.
    In addition to learning culture, these literacy classes generally also regularly conduct learning on current affairs and policies. The broad masses of women of various ethnic groups have improved their political awareness through learning, realizing that the past pain was not "destined" or "bad luck," but caused by the oppression of the reactionary ruling class in the old society.
    In many areas, women have learned and discussed the new Marriage Law in their studies, realizing that the spirit of the new Marriage Law is mainly to protect women's rights. At the same time, regarding the provisions in the new Marriage Law that "in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, the people's governments (or military and political committees) of the large administrative regions or the provincial people's governments may, based on the specific circumstances of marriage issues of local ethnic minorities, formulate certain modified or supplementary provisions to this law, and submit them to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation," they feel even more that the people's government's care for ethnic minorities is truly meticulous, and believe that this is reasonable and express their firm support.
    Due to the improvement of political awareness, many women of fraternal ethnic groups have signed the peace declaration and are now actively participating in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country.
    The liberated women of various fraternal ethnic groups in the Northwest have deeply realized that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, their days of suffering and darkness, the years of being insulted and harmed, are gone forever. They have gained liberation and will forever move victoriously toward a bright future of freedom and happiness.

　　解放了的西北各族妇女
     胡钧
    西北是一个多民族的地区，除汉族以外，还有维吾尔、回、藏、哈萨克、蒙、土、柯尔克孜、锡伯、撒拉、俄罗斯、乌孜别克、索伦、满族及塔吉克、塔塔尔等将近二十个少数民族；各少数民族将近七百万人，约占全西北总人口（二千六百五十万人）的四分之一。由于历代封建王朝及蒋介石匪帮反动统治的结果，造成了各民族间、特别是汉族与各少数民族间的不团结现象。这种情况，一直到一九四九年人民解放军进军解放大西北，和中华人民共和国成立后，才基本上改变过来。
    西北各兄弟民族摆脱了千百年来的民族压迫、封建统治，这对于占各兄弟民族半数人口的妇女来说，是有着特别意义的。一般说来，由于各兄弟民族在政治、经济、文化发展上比较落后，宗教信仰很深，因而各兄弟民族妇女们所遭受的封建摧残和痛苦，比起汉族妇女来，也更深重，更厉害。但是，自从大西北获得解放以后，西北各兄弟民族的妇女们也就开始翻身了。一年来，在西北各级人民政府的领导帮助之下，各兄弟民族妇女已经初步地组织起来，各地先后建立了代表各族广大妇女群众利益的妇女组织——各级民主妇女联合会。广大的各族妇女群众起来参加了各种社会活动、政权工作和生产运动，并积极参加学习，要求提高自己的文化。
  一、西北各地民主妇女联合会相继成立，各族广大妇女已初步组
        织起来。
    根据不完全的统计，西北各兄弟民族妇女组织，除西北民主妇女联合会之外，在新疆，迪化市已于一九五○年五月间成立了市民主妇女联合会；新疆全省已有三个专区和四十五个县、市先后成立了包括各族妇女的民主妇女联合会或民主妇女联合会的筹备会。在甘肃，包括着全省五个民族（汉、回、藏、蒙、东乡）三百多万妇女的全省民主妇女联合会已于去年十月间在全省第一届妇女代表大会召开后正式成立；兰州市则早在去年四月间就成立了市的民主妇女联合会。在宁夏，包括着回、汉两个民族的全省民主妇女联合会于去年九月间正式成立；银川市在去年七月间成立了市的民主妇女联合会。青海省和西宁市也先后于去年六、七月间成立了包括全省五个民族（汉、回、蒙、藏、土）的省和市的民主妇女联合会。
    这些妇女组织的筹备和成立，都得了当地各级人民政府及中国共产党负责同志的积极指导与鼓励，从多方面给他们以帮助，因而使妇女工作的开展获得了有利的条件。
    其次，在各种政权机关及各级人民代表会议、农民代表会议、青年代表会议等群众组织中也都普遍地吸收了各兄弟民族妇女的代表参加。她们和男人在一起工作，活动，参加选举，当代表，当政权干部；她们已经得到了政治上的民主权利，而不再是男子的附属物了。在参加这些活动和工作中，她们都表现得积极，热情。广大的西北各兄弟民族妇女们，业已逐渐地摆脱了旧社会封建势力的束缚，开始从家庭中走出来，她们的工作已不再局限于在家庭中做“烧锅煮饭，养儿抱蛋，缝衣补烂”这些琐事，她们确已获得解放。
  二、各族妇女参加劳动生产，提高了她们在家庭中和在社会上的
        地位。
    西北各兄弟民族的妇女们是有着爱劳动生产的光荣传统的。西北解放以后，各兄弟民族的妇女们就已经认识到：在新社会里，在人民自己做了主人的国家里，人人都应该参加劳动，劳动人民是最光荣的；同时她们也认识到：要想求得妇女本身在政治和文化上的彻底解放，不首先求得在经济上的解放也是不可能的。而求得在经济上的解放，就必须要参加劳动生产。因此，各地的民主妇女联合会也都把发动妇女参加劳动生产定为中心工作之一。
    根据现有材料看来，去年在新疆的喀什、迪化、莎车、阿克苏、焉耆等六个专区和迪化市共有各族妇女四十九万余人参加了修渠、开荒、秋收等生产运动，在运动中并涌现出大批积极分子和劳动模范。喀什区开荒的妇女有八千多人，开垦荒地七千多亩。迪化市参加修筑乌鲁木齐河河堤的各族妇女有一万二千九百多人，她们和男人一样下水挖土，有八人被选为劳动模范。
    许多农村妇女组织了生产互助小组，发展家庭副业，挣得了工资和收益。这样，就使得一般向来看不起女人，认为女人“不顶事”的丈夫也高兴了，因而增进了夫妻间的感情，提高了妇女在家庭中的和社会上的地位。
    在发动和组织各族妇女参加劳动生产的过程中，更使不同民族的妇女们消除了过去长期间所存在的民族歧视与隔阂，促进了各族人民之间的团结。例如：宁夏省农村中，过去回汉两族妇女互不往来，一言不合就吵架，但自从解放以后，成立了村妇女会，就再也没有这种现象了。
  三、各族妇女积极参加学习，提高了她们的政治觉悟与文化水平。
    在过去封建社会的压迫与束缚下，各民族的妇女是得不到学习文化的机会的。在旧社会里，一般男人，甚且包括妇女们自己在内，很多人都认为女人要“大门不出，二门不迈”，遵守“三从四德”的封建道德，说什么“女子无才便是德”，“女人懂得个啥，没啥学头”等等，所以妇女学习文化，乃是极罕见的事。以新疆南部的文化中心疏附县为例，全县妇女共十二万六千四百五十人，根据去年年初当地文化教育机关的统计，受教育的情况是：中等学校仅有一百三十名女生，小学也仅有三千九百三十八名女生，其余百分之九十七以上都是文盲。
    但是，自从妇女们在政治上获得解放，参加了各种社会的、政治的活动，参加了劳动生产之后，她们就积极要求提高自己的文化了。大西北解放后，为了满足各民族妇女们的这种迫切要求，在各地人民政府与各级民主妇女联合会的帮助与筹划下，成立了许多妇女识字组、识字班，广大的各族妇女群众被卷入了学习的浪潮。
    根据去年十月西安群众日报的统计，在新疆各县、市共有六百多处妇女识字班，参加学习的各族妇女有十八万八千余人。迪化市在市民主妇女联合会和市人民政府教育科的努力下，以小学为主要据点，在全市建立了三十一个妇女识字班，有九百零四名家庭妇女参加了文化学习。市民主妇女联合会翻印了一千五百本《工农劳动妇女课本》，用维吾尔族的文字油印了一千三百本课本，又专设了阅览室，备有维吾尔与汉族两族文字的书籍供给妇女们阅览。
    各地妇女们学习的热情空前高涨：积极，认真，努力。例如：青海互助县新元乡的妇女们在学习中互相介绍自己的学习经验，提出学习要保持一定的进度，每天至少要认三个生字，并要举行定期比赛，发动并介绍自己的家里人和邻居参加文化学习等。
    这类识字班除学习文化之外，一般的又都经常进行了关于时事、政策的学习。广大的各族妇女群众从学习中提高了自己的政治觉悟，认识到过去的苦痛，不是什么“命里注定”，“命运不济”，而是旧社会反动统治阶级的压迫所造成的。
    不少地区的妇女们在学习中对新婚姻法进行了学习和讨论，认识到新婚姻法的精神主要是保障妇女的权利，同时对于新婚姻法中规定的：“在少数民族聚居的地区，大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）或省人民政府得依据当地少数民族婚姻问题的具体情况，对本法制定某些变通的或补充的规定，提请政务院批准施行。”更感到人民政府对少数民族的照顾，真是无微不至；认为这是合情合理的，表示坚决拥护。
    由于政治觉悟的提高，很多兄弟民族的妇女们都在和平宣言上签了名，现正积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    解放了的西北各兄弟民族妇女们，她们已深刻地认识到，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，她们的痛苦黑暗的日子，被侮辱与被损害的年代是一去不复返了。她们已经获得了解放，并且将永远朝向着自由、幸福的光明前途胜利前进。
