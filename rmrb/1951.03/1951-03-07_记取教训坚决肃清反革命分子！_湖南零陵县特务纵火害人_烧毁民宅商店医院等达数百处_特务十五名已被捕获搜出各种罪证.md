    [Our Newspaper] Special agents of the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, lurking in Lingling County, Hunan Province, carried out large-scale arson on the morning of February 20th, taking advantage of the city's military and civilians celebrating the Lantern Festival. Due to strong winds that day, the fire spread rapidly from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm before it was extinguished. According to preliminary investigations, the arson committed by these counter-revolutionary special agents destroyed a street extending 600 meters. Five hundred and twelve houses were burned down, resulting in four residents being killed or injured. Six hundred and thirty-two merchant families were affected, accounting for one-seventh of the city's households; the affected population was two thousand and seventy-seven people, accounting for one-tenth of the city's population. The people suffered enormous losses, estimated at over 15.9 billion yuan when converted into currency. Several arsonist special agents were captured on the day the fire broke out. The next day, several more special agents attempted to set fire to the city's grain company and native produce company but were also captured by us. A total of fifteen arsonist special agents were captured over two days, and gasoline, incendiary bombs, sulfur balls, lighters, cotton, and other items were seized.
    According to the confessions of the arrested special agents: they had met on the 26th day of the twelfth lunar month last year and the 14th day of the first lunar month this year, conspiring to set fire to the city during the Lantern Festival. They also decided to give 50,000 yuan for starting one fire, with more given for starting more fires.
    This crime committed by the special agents of the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has aroused unparalleled anger among the people of the entire city. A donation campaign is now underway throughout the city to help the affected people. The local government and people from all walks of life have jointly formed a relief committee to actively carry out relief and resettlement work. (Liu Hezheng, Liu Shuomin)
