A Brief Discussion of Seed Vernalization Contains Errors
Reader Gao Deming Writes to Request the Author to Self-Criticize

To the Editorial Comrades:

    After reading Mr. Le Tianyu's article "A Brief Discussion of Seed Vernalization" in your newspaper, I have the following opinions:

    Mr. Le Tianyu said: "Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs, identified the five grains, made plows and hoes, and invented cultivation, etc., which was the beginning of mankind's use of nature to transform nature." As far as I know, Chinese historical records and archaeological excavations cannot prove the existence of the so-called "Shennong," it is only a legend. I wonder what Mr. Le based this on?

    He also said: "Shennong's 'Shennong Ben Cao Jing' has been passed down to this day and is still a classic document in agriculture and medicine. In the world, this is indeed the earliest original document on botany." I think this is also unfounded. The so-called "Shennong Ben Cao Jing" is a forged book, which is common knowledge. Some people say that it was compiled by someone falsely in the Yuanshi era of Emperor Ping of the Western Han Dynasty; others say that it was forged by Zhang Zhongjing, Hua Tuo, and others in the Later Han Dynasty. In any case, it cannot be said to be "Shennong's Shennong Ben Cao Jing," which is very clear. I wonder what Mr. Le based this on?

    He also said: "The female inventor Leizu Xiling, pioneered silkworm rearing and cocoon reeling, for clothing purposes," etc., these are obviously not based on facts. I think Mr. Le's article is completely unscientific.

    Speaking of the issue of seed vernalization, Mr. Le said: "Taking wheat as an example, the oldest tradition is in the Taihang area." I am a layman on these issues, but I cannot see any basis for what Mr. Le said in his article. What exactly is the case, I hope you will quickly ask Mr. Le to clarify and give me a reply. I hope Mr. Le can self-criticize the errors in this article.

Editor's Note: Comrade Gao Deming's letter raises very good points. The publication of the article "A Brief Discussion of Seed Vernalization" in our newspaper was a very inappropriate oversight. The author of the article quoted some ancient myths and legends and pseudo-books uncritically, which is a very wrong and unscientific attitude. The author's explanation of "vernalization" is also lacking in evidence and the content is poor. Comrade Gao Deming's request to examine the errors in this article is entirely justified.

### 《略谈种子春化法》文中有错误  读者高德明来信要求作者检讨

　　《略谈种子春化法》文中有错误
    读者高德明来信要求作者检讨编辑同志：
    顷读贵报刊载乐天宇先生所作《略谈种子春化法》一文，我有如下的意见：
    乐天宇先生说：“神农氏尝百草、辨五谷、作耒耜、发明栽培等，实为人类利用自然改造自然的开始。”据我所知，我国史籍和考古发掘都不能证明所谓“神农氏”的存在，它只是一种传说而已。不知乐先生是根据什么来说的？
    他又说：“神农氏的《神农本草经》，流传到今天，仍是农医两科的经典文献。就全世界来说，关于植物学的原始文献，这确是最早的一本书。”我觉得这也是没有根据的。所谓《神农本草经》是一本伪书，这是人所共知的。有的人说它是西汉平帝元始年间的人所假托编纂的；有的人说它是后汉张仲景、华陀等人所伪作的。不管怎么样，决不能说是“神农氏的神农本草经”，这是很明白的。不知乐先生又有什么根据？
    他又说：“女发明家嫘祖西陵氏，创始养蚕治茧，供衣着之用”等等，这些显然都是没有事实根据的。乐先生的文章，我认为完全不是科学的。
    谈到种子春化的问题，乐先生说：“即以小麦而论，最古流传的是太行区”。我对于这些问题是门外汉，但是我从乐先生的文章里看不出他所说的有什么根据来。究竟如何，希望你们快快问明乐先生，给我一个答复。我希望乐先生能检讨这篇文章的错误。 高德明
    编者按：高德明同志来信所提的意见很好。本报刊登了《略谈种子春化法》一文，是极不应有的疏忽。该文的作者把古代的一些神话传说和伪书，毫无批判地加以引用，这是非常错误的非科学的态度。作者对于“春化法”的说明也是缺少根据，内容贫乏的。高德明同志要求检讨这篇文章中的错误，是完全正当的。
