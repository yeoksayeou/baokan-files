　　Notice on Wage Issuance Measures for "March 8th" Festival for Women Workers in Beijing Enterprises

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau recently issued a notice stipulating the following wage issuance measures for the "March 8th" Festival for women workers in state-owned and private enterprises in Beijing:

    1. All female employees shall have a half-day holiday on "March 8th" Women's Day, with wages paid as usual.

    2. If a holiday cannot be granted due to work needs, overtime wages equivalent to half a working day shall be paid (piece-rate wages shall be calculated and paid based on the average monthly wage or by converting from a relatively normal production date).

    3. The method for issuing holiday wages (or overtime wages) to temporary workers and staff on supply or contract systems shall remain the same as the measures for issuing annual leave and Spring Festival wages issued by the Labor Bureau last year (see this newspaper from December 26th of last year).
