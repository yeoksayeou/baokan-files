　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports that the 1951 Spring Leipzig Fair, which opened on March 4th in Leipzig, successfully concluded on March 11th.

　　This fair was a major event in international life, powerfully demonstrating the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in post-war economic construction and the development of its foreign trade. It also powerfully demonstrated the situation of peaceful construction and mutually beneficial economic and cultural exchanges among the countries of the peace camp. At a time when American and British imperialism are intensifying war preparations around the world—especially in West Germany—thereby undermining the peaceful economy, it is of particular importance to the cause of German unity and European peace. At the mass rally held on the second day of the fair, Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic stated that the German Democratic Republic's foreign trade volume increased by 42.9 percent last year and would double again this year. During the fair, the German Democratic Republic concluded transactions with West Germany and various foreign countries amounting to 230 million marks, with transactions with West Germany reaching 90 million marks. The German Democratic Republic signed export contracts with various foreign countries that were twice as many as in the spring of last year. It has now signed contracts not only with all countries that maintain normal trade relations with it, but also with almost all Western countries—especially the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and the United States.

　　莱比锡博览会圆满闭幕
    【新华社十三日讯】综合塔斯社讯：三月四日在莱比锡开幕的一九五一年春季博览会已于三月十一日圆满闭幕。
    这次博览会是国际生活中的一件大事，它有力地表示了德意志民主共和国在战后经济建设中的成就和对外贸易的发展，同时也有力地表示了和平阵营各国和平建设与经济上文化上交流互助的情景。当此美英帝国主义在世界各地——特别是在西德加紧备战，因而破坏了和平经济的情况下，它对德国统一与欧洲和平的事业具有特殊重要的意义。在博览会开幕的第二天举行的群众大会上，德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希说到德意志民主共和国的对外贸易额在去年曾增加了百分之四十二点九，今年要再增加一倍。而在这次博览会期中，德意志民主共和国与西德及各外国成交的交易数达二亿三千万马克，与西德间的交易达九千万马克。德意志民主共和国与各外国签订的出口货合同比去年春天多一倍。它现在不但与和它维持正常的贸易关系的一切国家签订了合同，而且与差不多一切西方国家——特别是荷兰、丹麦、芬兰、瑞士、瑞典、奥地利和美国——都签订了合同。
