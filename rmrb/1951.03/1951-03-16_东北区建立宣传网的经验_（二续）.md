　　Northeast Region's Experience in Establishing a Propaganda Network (Continued 2)
     Fu Zhensheng
    IV. Content of Propaganda

    The content of mass propaganda is determined based on the Party's current tasks at each period, and it also changes with different historical stages. The current mass propaganda work mainly involves continuing to carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement, enhancing the vast people's anti-imperialist and patriotic internationalist consciousness, hating, despising, and scorning U.S. imperialism, thoroughly sweeping away the pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American ideological toxins spread by imperialism and its running dogs, establishing a sense of self-esteem and self-confidence in loving the motherland and loving the people, and promoting the vast people's high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in labor production, in order to continuously improve labor productivity and strive to consolidate national defense, develop the economy, and defend world peace.

    In terms of the specific content of mass propaganda, based on the experience of various regions, it can be roughly summarized into the following aspects:

    First, publicize domestic and international current events.

    Current events propaganda occupies a very important position in the content of mass propaganda, especially during the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement. It has attracted the attention of the entire Party, and current events propaganda has gradually reached a climax. Propagandists scattered in various industrial and mining enterprises, large, medium, and small cities, and the vast rural areas, with tireless spirit, explained the current international and domestic situation to the vast people, pointed out the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, the great significance of the Korean people's anti-American struggle, pointed out the attitude and position of our Party and the Chinese people towards these events, and called on the people to carry out in-depth Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement with practical actions.

    In the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement, current events propaganda is not abstract or isolated from today's practical activities, but closely combines current events propaganda with current tasks, infiltrating it into the daily life and work of the people, so that everyone knows the great significance of their labor in opposing imperialist aggression and defending their motherland, thereby consciously increasing labor enthusiasm and creativity, and carrying out heroic struggles to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

    Propagandists in various regions have produced many typical examples in conducting current events propaganda. They grasped the psychology of the masses, used the familiar experiences of the masses, and used the masses' own language to conduct simple and easy-to-understand propaganda, thus achieving great results.

    Comrade Zhao Guoyou is a labor hero of the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 3 and a representative of the Northeast Region attending the National Model Workers Representative Conference. When he returned from Beijing, it was the time when the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement began to be launched. He himself made more than fifteen current affairs reports inside and outside the factory, and it is estimated that the audience reached about 20,000 people.

    Zhao Guoyou used the working class's own language to tell the workers about his personal suffering under imperialism and the beautiful scenes of the political, economic, and cultural life of the workers after liberation. He used recalling the past to arouse the workers' hatred of imperialism, and looking at the present to arouse the workers' determination to oppose imperialism and defend their motherland. Pointing to the newly built dormitories and sanatoriums in the factory, he said, "Look, you couldn't even imagine such houses in the past, and the Japanese devils didn't care where you slept. If you were sick, you deserved to die. Now we have four people in a room, bright electric lights, and desks. In addition, there are bathrooms, clubs, barber shops, and libraries. You can do whatever you want after work. The sanatoriums are even better! If you're tired from work or have a minor illness, you can rest. Isn't this blessing only possible because Chairman Mao led everyone to drive away imperialism?" Mentioning the improvement of the working class's political status, he said, "As you all know, I, Lao Zhao, never dreamed that I would go abroad, participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to discuss state affairs, and meet the leader of a country! Chairman Mao entertains foreign ambassadors, such grand occasions, and he even asks us workers to accompany him. Wouldn't this be a joke two years ago?" Then he turned to the main topic, pointing out how U.S. imperialism was following the old path of the Japanese invaders to invade us, and how we should crush the U.S. imperialist aggression in order to protect this happy life. He said, "The big old Americans say their machines are good, but our machines must beat theirs!" When talking about Sino-Korean relations, he cited the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean people fighting side by side in the Anti-Japanese War, and said, "In the past, when we had a fire, our neighbors saved us regardless of their lives. Now that our neighbors have a fire, we can't just ignore it!"

    When the failure of the Korean War affected some people's thinking, Zhao Guoyou moved into the factory from his home at this time. When some workers saw him carrying his luggage into the factory, they asked, "Lao Zhao, why are you moving into the factory at this time?" He replied with a smile, "It's precisely at this time that I'm moving into the factory, so that the big old Americans know that the more rampant they are, the more energetic our production will be. The relationship between our workers and the factory is unbreakable."

    After the publication of the joint declaration of various parties to Resist America and Aid Korea, Zhao Guoyou publicized to the workers, "You really can't reason with beasts. We've told U.S. imperialism all the reasons—Premier Zhou Enlai has told them again and again, and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has also repeatedly told them at the United Nations. U.S. imperialism is just recklessly doing whatever it wants!"

    Zhao Guoyou's simple and easy-to-understand propaganda has a very great educational effect on the working masses.

    Meng Tai, a propagandist of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and a representative attending the National Model Workers Representative Conference, made nearly twenty reports after returning from Beijing, with an audience of about 20,000 people.

    He used the facts he personally saw in Beijing combined with the problems existing in the minds of the workers to carry out propaganda. He vividly explained that the working people had changed from the enslaved position of the old society to the masters of the new China, how lovable the people's motherland was, how lovable the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao was, and how glorious the model workers were. He used the powerful strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army he saw at the National Day parade in Beijing to illustrate that the Chinese people had sufficient strength to defend their motherland and were not afraid of U.S. imperialist aggression. He used the contrast between today's life and the past to illustrate the importance of defending the motherland and defending world peace. He said, "Who doesn't want to eat soybean cakes and acorn flour, who doesn't want to be scolded and beaten by others, who doesn't want to be a subjugated slave, who doesn't want the suffering of the past to come back, who should step up production, produce more steel, and use production achievements to strike at the American devils, so that they don't come to destroy our good days."

    Zhang Zifu, a propagandist from Fushun and a representative attending the National Model Workers Representative Conference, made 30 reports after returning from Beijing, with an audience of about 7,000 or 8,000 people.

    When he explained the situation of U.S. imperialism launching a war of aggression, he said, "It's like a mad dog, lying in the Americas, with two hind legs on Europe and two front legs extended to Asia—how long can it stand in this posture?" At this time, he gave the masses a little time to think. When he saw many people nodding, he continued, "If the paw extended to South Korea stands still honestly, it can live a little longer; now that this paw has been extended to North Korea, it will scratch people with its nails, which doesn't matter, but the Korean people will cut off its toes one by one, and finally cut off one of its legs..." When he described the insatiable greed of U.S. imperialism, he improvised a ditty and said, "The big old Americans now have one foot in two boats, wanting to go to Hebei and also wanting to go to Jiangnan, warships to Taiwan, troops to fight in Korea, holding Chiang Kai-shek in both hands, and still thinking about Syngman Rhee. A rabbit's tail can't be long, it will fall into the river and be finished."

    Zang Jiyou, a technician worker selected as a propagandist by Anshan Mine, whether in the factory, on the road, or at home, talks to everyone he meets. Over time, when people around him don't understand the situation, they say, "Let's go to Lao Zang's to find out the bottom line" and listen to his "current affairs news."

    Last October, due to the tense situation of the Korean War, many people were preparing to move to the countryside. A worker surnamed Yin who lived downstairs from Lao Zang said to Lao Zang, "Now everyone is clamoring that the American army is going to cross the river and the planes are going to bomb Anshan, which makes me unable to concentrate on my work." Lao Zang explained to him, "It's possible that their planes will come to make trouble, but if their army wants to cross the river, they'll have to be prisoners." Then he talked to him about why air defense was necessary, and then he turned to the Northeast Liberation War. He said, "The Korean War is the same. Don't look at the Americans acting fiercely. It's just for show. Sooner or later, they'll suffer." After Lao Zang said this, the worker surnamed Yin felt relieved and said before leaving, "According to what you said, I still have to concentrate on production!"

    When launching the Resist America, Aid Korea production competition, Lao Zang became even more energetic. He often studied propaganda methods and paid attention to what everyone was interested in hearing and what could move the masses' hearts. He only started doing it after he understood the psychology of the masses. One day, he went to the concentrate group and met Sun Wanshun. He casually said to him, "Lao Sun, the American army in Korea is really not doing things right!" Sun Wanshun immediately asked, "What's wrong?" He told Sun Wanshun how the American army raped women and killed many people in Korea. When Sun Wanshun heard this, he became angry and gnashed his teeth, saying, "The American devils are too inhumane. Why rape women and kill innocent people in war? These beasts must be killed." While they were talking, many people gathered around, and Lao Zang raised his voice and said, "The big old Americans are too ambitious. They not only want to invade Korea, but also want to come to our Northeast. Now the volunteer troops are going to Korea to protect our motherland and our hometown and prevent these beasts from invading us." These words of his excited everyone. Someone said, "We have to find a way to drive the Americans out of Korea." When he saw that everyone was energized, he immediately turned the topic to the main point and said, "There is a way. The current Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic production competition is to fight the big old Americans. If we step up production and produce one more ton of concentrate, it will be like pulling one of their tendons. We will use production achievements to deal with them." Everyone then said, "Lao Zang is right. We have to work harder and defeat this bastard."

    Yang Chunhua, a propagandist of Jixi Coal Mine and a first-class model worker in the entire mine, composed a quick-rhythm rhyme at the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement: "Truman, what a bastard, came to Korea to make trouble. Volunteer army, joined the war, defeated them and scattered their troops. Comrades, work harder, produce more coal, top the bombs." The workers read the rhyme and became more energetic as they dug coal. But there were still a small number of people who did not actively participate in the labor competition, so he used an enlightening method to draw a picture of the award ceremony for model workers; the advanced workers were sitting on the podium with glory flowers, and the backward workers were standing under the stage with their heads down, and gave it a name called "Think of a Way." The backward workers knew it was themselves as soon as they saw it, which was really embarrassing; so they all "thought of a way" to improve production, and all the workers in the entire pit participated in the competition. When the backward ones made progress, he immediately praised, encouraged, and consolidated their achievements. For example, worker Yang Ciyun had always been backward for three years. During the competition, his output suddenly increased to the first in the entire pit. He composed another quick-rhythm rhyme and posted it: "Yang Ciyun, really good, determined to get the big red flag, not active in the first half of the month, confused and passed by. Not angry, not anxious, always sulking every day. This month's challenge is right against the enemy, he is the first in the entire pit in the first ten days. Don't look at being backward in the past, now we still have to learn from him." Through Comrade Yang Chunhua's propaganda, the workers' energy was like twisting a rope, the tighter it was twisted, the more the production task exceeded 50% on average every month, which was very different from the previous three quarters when the task was barely completed. When the pit leader saw Comrade Yang Chunhua, he said, "Really good, finally publicized the coal."

    Xu Chenglin, the propaganda member and branch secretary of Daping Mountain Village, Jiudong District, Zhaodong, Heilongjiang, is the leader of the propaganda team in the village. After the U.S. imperialists launched a war of aggression, on the basis of past propaganda work, he launched a current affairs propaganda campaign to resist America and aid Korea. At the beginning of the propaganda, due to only publicizing the brutality of the American devils, some villagers were afraid of the Americans after hearing it, and some secretly said: "Let them fight in Korea, what does it have to do with us?!" The bad guys took the opportunity to spread rumors, affecting some villagers to indulge in eating and drinking. According to this situation, after research by party members, Communist Youth League members, and propagandists, it was decided that the focus should be on publicizing "Why the people are bound to win and U.S. imperialism is bound to be defeated" and "What is the relationship between the Chinese and Korean people." After the meeting, the work was divided. Comrade Xu Chenglin told the villagers of Taiping Mountain Village: "U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, and we will definitely defeat its aggression." But the villagers did not say anything after listening and the meeting broke up. He thought this was a problem of speaking too simply. Accepting this lesson, the next day he went to Liqipai Village to promote, using the painful life of the puppet Manchukuo for fourteen years and the life led by the Communist Party in recent years to make a comparative contrast. The venue was especially quiet. When he talked about the U.S. imperialists coming to invade us again, the villagers shouted: "We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression!" Then he said: Our Chinese people have already stood up, with the leadership of Chairman Mao, with 475 million people, and with 5 million powerful national defense forces. He also explained in detail the fatal weaknesses of U.S. imperialism. On the spot, seven or eight villagers rushed to offer stretchers. Communist Youth League member Yue Wuchen signed up to join the volunteer army at that time. From then on, he stirred up the villagers' love for the motherland. In less than five days, 14 young farmers signed up to join the volunteer army, and six villagers volunteered to take stretchers to Korea. However, in the midst of this, the villagers had the mistaken view that engaging in sideline businesses was not "resisting America and aiding Korea." Therefore, in the winter school, he explained to the masses that engaging in sideline businesses was the material strength to resist America and aid Korea. If production is not done well, we can only fight today's war, but not tomorrow's war. He also made a slogan: "Work actively on sideline businesses, and the American devils will be finished!" Everywhere he went to promote. In less than two days, the villagers were engaged in sideline businesses. Wang Xifeng shouted when a yellow weasel entered the village: "Beat an American devil!" He promoted to everyone: "The more yellow weasels you beat and the more money you sell, the American devils will collapse before your eyes." When the news of the liberation of Pyongyang reached the village, the masses were so happy that they jumped high, voluntarily bringing fat pigs, chickens, and cash to comfort the volunteer army. However, Ping Shirong said: "This time it's okay, we will definitely defeat it completely this year." The branch studied and felt that this was a paralyzing and relaxing thought generated by the masses in the victory sound. The propagandists went down again to explain to the masses: We should continue to work hard to pay public grain well, engage in sideline businesses well, and support the struggle to resist America and aid Korea to the final victory, and we should not relax.

    During a branch committee meeting in December, the Jiaohe Nangang Village Branch of Jilin studied the situation provided by the propagandists and found that villager Feng Zhong had said: Koreans are second-class Japanese, and if they "get the land," we will have to give up. Some old people in the village couldn't understand the resistance to America and assistance to Korea, "agree to resist America, disagree to aid Korea." The branch committee believed that this was an important ideological problem, especially since Koreans accounted for a large proportion of the village. If this problem was not solved, the completion of every task would be restricted, and the enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea could not be brought into play. It was decided to concentrate efforts to solve this problem. After the meeting, the propagandists separately convened village meetings to explain the blood relationship between the Chinese and Korean people for many years, and cited the examples studied at the branch committee meeting, pointing out that in the past, Japanese devils used Korean traitors to provoke the unity of the Chinese and Korean people, and also talked about the principle of "lips are gone, teeth are cold, the house is broken, and the hall is in danger" between the Chinese and Korean people today. All the Chinese and Korean villagers in the village were enlightened. From then on, the village changed. In the past, when Chinese farmers helped Korean farmers transport public grain, they had to get foot money first, but now they didn't even mention it, and they went to the Korean villagers' homes to load cars in the middle of the night.

    Du Rongjie, the propaganda member and branch secretary of Liujia Village, Xinmin, Liaoxi, is a propagandist who can go deep into the masses. Once, when Pinong Di Chengcai of the village saw the students doing the Yangko dance, he said impatiently: "Why are you still happy? Don't you see what time it is now!" This shows that he was not very clear about the situation and was somewhat pessimistic. Other propagandists explained the situation to him, but he did not believe it. Comrade Du Rongjie knew about it and personally went to promote and explain to him. She started from Di Chengcai's childhood herding pigs and grew up to suffer hardships, and continued to talk about how Di Chengcai was divided into houses and land after liberation, and now he is living a good life without worrying about food or fuel, and then talked about the purpose of the American devils' invasion of Korea, and our strength to defeat the American imperialist attack. After her repeated and patient persuasion, Di Chengcai understood. And he said: "I will definitely fight the American devils to the end and resolutely follow the Communist Party!"

    Cui Yajun, the director of the Women's Federation of Yingfang Village, Xinmin, Liaoxi, often uses chatty methods to conduct current affairs propaganda. After the U.S. military landed in Incheon, some villagers said: "The American paper tiger has become a real tiger." She promoted to the masses: "The U.S. imperialist front is too long, and the rear cannot supply it. It is like a person getting throat disease, with insufficient strength, and not enough air to catch his breath. Besides, many American soldiers are poor people who are unwilling to sell their lives for capitalists, just like our poor and middle peasants are unwilling to sell their lives for landlords, so it is said that U.S. imperialism is still a paper tiger." An old man said: "Paper tiger, why did the Korean army retreat?" She said: "Uncle, for example, you are so big, I am smaller than you and can't beat you, but if four or five people come, they will beat you, right? In Incheon, there are 40,000 to 50,000 Americans and 2,000 Koreans. Using 20 to 1 soldiers, this is called a hero who does not suffer immediate losses. Korea retreated a little and looked for opportunities to eliminate it." The old man nodded in agreement with her reasoning. Some villagers said: "Our army is unparalleled in the world, but the United States has many planes and atomic bombs are powerful!" She said: "Last year, the 13th brigade passed through our village, and the Kuomintang planes dropped more than a dozen bombs. Everyone hid, and no one was injured. Besides, we also have planes, and the Soviet big brother also has atomic bombs. What are we afraid of?" As soon as the villagers heard this, they said: "Yes, this girl really knows the truth."

    Yu Jiang, the propaganda member of Xidaqiao Village, Tangyuan, Songjiang, is the leader of the propaganda team in the village, a demobilized soldier, and the deputy village chief. In terms of leadership methods, he attaches great importance to propaganda work. He said: "Words can't be spoken clearly, sand pots can't be broken without hitting them, and everything must first get through the thought." When the Korean War was tense, the masses were temporarily confused, and their hearts were not at ease. Some people scrambled to buy foreign oil, foreign fire, table salt and other daily necessities. When he saw this situation, he knew that the masses did not have enough understanding of the comparison of strength between the enemy and us, and they did not see the American paper tiger clearly. Some people were afraid that the American "furniture" was good, so he combined his own experience of joining the army in 1946 and carried out propaganda to the masses, saying: "When I was a soldier, everyone was given two grenades, dozens of bullets, and the food and clothing were not good, but we were a people's army and went to fight for the people. Later, we used American weapons. It's not enough to have good "furniture," you have to see who uses it." And he explained to the masses: "We have 5 million people's liberation army, who defeated Chiang Kai-shek armed with American weapons. If the American devils dare to come, we can eliminate them. Don't look at the Korean People's Army retreating now. When we were just recovered in the past, wasn't the Kuomintang quite able to brag?" After listening to his propaganda, the masses all said: "That's how we were recovered, and we still won, not to mention that we have a strong army now!" After this propaganda, the emotions of the villagers turned around.

    Wu Jinfeng, the director of the Women's Federation of Youhao Square, Zhongshan District, Dalian City, once used the little time she had to repair her leather shoes to chat with the shoemaker about his life. The shoemaker said: "Life is really good now. The whole family is well-fed and well-clothed. Sitting here to repair shoes, no one drives us away with sticks anymore, and there are no more customers who don't pay for repairing shoes and still beat people." But how did these benefits come about? The shoemaker was not very clear. So Wu Jinfeng told him how the Communist Party led the masses to struggle arduously against imperialism and reactionaries, how Chairman Mao led the Red Army on the 25,000-li Long March, and when crossing the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, they lacked food and only ate wild grass. And she said that all this was to help the poor people turn over and live a good life. The shoemaker was moved to tears. She then related it to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, so that the shoemaker deeply realized how much the U.S. imperialist invasion of Korea was related to the life of his family.

    Liu Xueshi, a propagandist from Anguang County, Heilongjiang (a cadre of the agency), often conducts current affairs propaganda to farmers at the propaganda station in the trading market, publishes blackboards, writes news, and often prepares situation maps and comics. Through these forms, he explained to the farmers: "The American devils are following the old path of the Japanese devils, first invading Korea and then invading China. The Chinese people who have stood up cannot tolerate this. In order to protect a good life, they volunteered to take stretchers." When talking about maps and comics, he said to the villagers: "The American devils are raping, killing, bombing, and destroying in Korea, turning Seoul into a living hell, and doing only animal things." When talking about MacArthur releasing Japanese war criminals, he said: "In the past, the Japanese devils wanted soldiers, laborers, and servants. Aren't thought criminals, economic criminals, and national criminals the same as wolves? He released all the wolves who harmed the Chinese people. We have an irreconcilable hatred with him, and we can't let him."

    The Xianglu District United Cooperative of Xiuyan, Liaodong, has established a propaganda station. Manager Xu Baoshan and Deputy Manager Wu Weibang attach great importance to propaganda work. They can combine the vital interests of the masses to conduct current affairs propaganda, and the effect is quite great. During the tense period of the Korean War, the masses were panicked, and 40 to 50 people crowded the district cooperative every day, holding the attitude of storing goods and not storing money, scrambling to buy goods. Some people even indulged in eating and drinking, and asked: "Why did the price of cloth used to be 23,000 yuan, but now it sells for 26,000 yuan?" So Manager Xu explained to the masses: "U.S. imperialism invaded Korea with the intention of invading China. We must be wary and fully prepare for war-support work. Transportation is difficult, and goods are expensive. This is all caused by the American devils." Pointing to goods such as cloth, noodles, oil, salt, and wine, he said: "These are all good Chinese products, with such good quality. In the past, during the Japanese devil's rule, who could wear such cloth, eat such noodles, and drink such wine? Wasn't it tightly controlled by the high-ranking police, secret agents, landlords, and bullies? Aren't our poor brothers considered economic criminals even if we wear home-woven cloth?" He used physical objects to educate the masses, so the people who bought the goods were very moved, listening on one hand and pondering the past on the other. He continued: "The American devils are going to take the old road of Japan and seize our good days." After listening to Manager Xu's propaganda, Lao Zhu from Zhujia Village immediately bought a pair of Ula with the money he didn't need temporarily to prepare to take stretchers. He also said: "The current cooperative is entirely for our own benefit, treating cooperative members preferentially, and cooperative members always have priority in buying goods. If you spend it randomly now, you will suffer in the future." "The cooperative under the leadership of the Communist Party is developing forward day by day, and our lives will be improved more and more." This kind of propaganda, which combines its own business with the vital interests of the masses, not only improved the patriotic spirit of the masses, but also improved the masses' understanding of the cooperative, not only reducing the phenomenon of eating, drinking, and wasting, but also improving the enthusiasm of the masses for investing in the cooperative.

　　东北区建立宣传网的经验  （二续）
     富振声
    四、宣传的内容
    群众宣传的内容，是根据各个时期党的当前任务而规定的，同时也随着各个不同的历史阶段而有所改变。目前的群众宣传工作，主要是继续开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动，提高广大人民的反帝国主义的与爱国主义国际主义的自觉，仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义，彻底扫除帝国主义和它的走狗所散布的亲美、崇美、恐美的思想毒素，确定热爱祖国、热爱人民的自尊自信观念，发扬广大人民群众高度的劳动生产的积极性和创造性，以达到不断地提高劳动生产率，为巩固国防、发展经济、保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    在群众宣传的具体内容上，根据各地经验，大体可以归纳为下列几个方面：
    第一、宣传国内外时事
    时事宣传在群众宣传的内容上，占有非常重要的地位，特别在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，引起了全党的重视，使时事宣传逐步走向高潮。散布在各工矿企业、大中小城市以及广大农村的宣传员们，他们曾以不疲倦的精神，在广大的人民群众中解释当前的国际国内形势，指出美帝国主义的侵略本质，朝鲜人民反美斗争的重大意义，指出我们党和中国人民对这些事变的态度和主张，并号召人民群众以实际行动开展深入的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，时事宣传不是抽象的，孤立于今天的实际活动之外的，而是把时事宣传与当前任务密切结合起来，把它渗透到人民群众的日常生活和工作中去，使每个人都知道自己的劳动对于反对帝国主义侵略与保卫自己祖国的伟大意义，从而在自觉的基础上，更加提高劳动积极性和创造性，为保卫祖国保卫世界和平而进行英勇斗争。
    各地宣传员在进行时事宣传中，曾出现了不少典型的事例。他们抓住群众的心理，通过群众比较熟悉的经验，运用群众自己的语言进行简单通俗的宣传，因而收到很大的效果。
    赵国有同志是沈阳机器三厂的劳动英雄，是东北区出席全国劳动模范代表会议的代表。当他从北京回来，正是抗美援朝保家卫国运动开始发动的时候。他自己在厂内外做了十五次以上的时事报告，估计听众约达两万人左右。
    赵国有把自己亲身遭受帝国主义的苦难和解放后工人政治、经济、文化生活的美好情景，用工人阶级自己的语言讲给工人们听，用回忆过去，激起工人们对帝国主义的仇恨，用看看现在，激起工人们反帝国主义和保卫自己祖国的决心。他指着工厂新建的宿舍和休养所说：“你们看看，这样的房子，从前咱们就是想也不敢想，鬼子也不管你睡到那地方。有病，那就活该死。现在咱们四人一间，电灯亮亮的，还有办公桌，另外还有浴室、俱乐部、理发厅、图书馆，下工后随便你干什么都快活，休养所更好啦！干活累了，有点小病都可休养一下。这样的福气还不是毛主席领导大伙把帝国主义赶跑了才有的？”提到工人阶级政治地位的提高，他说：“你们都是知道的，我老赵过去做梦也没想到会出国，参加中国人民政治协商会议商量国家大事，见一国领袖啦！毛主席招待国外大使，多堂皇的场合，还找咱们工人陪客，在前两年说来这不是笑话吗？”接着他就转入正题，指出美帝国主义怎样踏着日寇老路来侵略我们，我们为了保卫这种幸福生活，应该怎样粉碎美帝国主义侵略。他说：“大老美说它的机器好，咱们的机器就要打过（胜过）它的机器！”讲到中朝关系，他就举出在抗日战争中中朝人民并肩作战的英勇事迹，并说：“以前我们失火，邻居不顾性命救火，现在邻居失火了，咱们不能反来不管哪！”
    当着因朝鲜战争失利影响到部分群众发生思想混乱时，赵国有恰在这时从家里搬进工厂里来。有的工人看见他抗着行李卷走进厂时便问：“老赵，这时候你怎的还搬进厂来住？”他笑嘻嘻地回答他们说：“就是这时候才搬进厂子里，叫大老美知道知道，他越猖狂，咱们的生产越有劲。咱们工人和工厂的关系，是枪打不散，炮轰不开的。”
    在各党派抗美援朝联合宣言发表后，赵国有向工人宣传说：“对野兽真是不能讲道理，咱们对美帝国主义啥道理都讲过了，——周恩来总理一讲再讲，苏联外交部长维辛斯基也在联合国反复的讲，美帝国主义就是一味蛮干！”
    赵国有同志的这种简单通俗的宣传，对工人群众的教育作用是非常大的。
    鞍山钢铁公司宣传员参加全国劳动模范代表会议的代表孟泰同志，从北京回来后，作了近二十次报告，听众约两万人。
    他拿亲眼在北京所见的事实结合工人心目中存在的问题进行宣传。他形象地说明劳动人民从旧社会的被奴役地位，变成了新中国的主人，人民的祖国该多么可爱，中国人民的领袖毛主席该多么可爱，劳动模范该多么光荣。他以在北京国庆典礼检阅式上所看到的强大的中国人民解放军的力量，来说明中国人民有充足的力量保卫祖国，决不怕美帝国主义侵略。他以今昔生活对比，说明保卫祖国保卫世界和平的重要。他说：“谁不愿意吃豆饼和橡子面，谁不愿意受人家打骂，谁不愿意当亡国奴，谁不愿意过去的苦难重来，谁就应该加紧生产，多出钢铁，拿出生产成绩来打击美国鬼子，不让他来破坏我们的好日子。”
    抚顺宣传员出席全国劳动模范代表会议代表张子富同志，从北京回来后，作过三十次报告，听众约七、八千人。
    他在解释美帝国主义发动侵略战争的形势时说：“就像一只疯狗一样，身子卧在美洲，两只后腿踏在欧洲，两只前腿又伸到亚洲，——这个架子，他能站长了吗？”这时他稍微给群众一点思索的时间，看到许多人点头的时候，他才又说下去：“伸到南朝鲜的这只爪子，若是老老实实站着不动，还能多活一会儿；现在这只爪子又伸到北朝鲜去，他用指甲扎人一下，那不要紧，朝鲜人民可就要一个一个地把它的脚趾砍掉，最后砍掉他一只腿。……”当他形容美帝国主义贪心无厌时，他随时编了个顺口溜说：“现在的大老美，脚踩两只船，又想上河北，又想下江南，军舰到台湾，出兵打朝鲜，双手捧着个蒋介石，心里还惦记着李承晚。兔子的尾巴长不了，掉在江里完了蛋。”
    鞍山矿厂选的宣传员技术工人臧基有同志，他不论在厂子里，或者走在路上，回到家里，逢人便说，见人便唠。时间长了，周围的人对时局一有不摸底的地方，就说：“走，到老臧那里掏掏底”，听他讲“时局消息”。
    去年十月，由于朝鲜战争的紧张形势，不少人就张罗往乡下搬，住在老臧楼下的一位姓尹的工人，就向老臧说：“现在都嚷嚷说美国军队要推过江来，飞机要炸鞍山，弄得我也没心思干活了”。老臧就向他解释说：“要说他的飞机来捣蛋，这有可能，它的军队想过江来，除非当俘虏。”随后他就把为什么防空向他谈了一些，后来又扯到东北解放战争上，他说：“朝鲜战争也是一样，你别看美国眼时凶跃，那是样子货，早晚他会吃到苦头的。”叫老臧这一讲，姓尹的工人心里塌实了，临走时说：“照你讲，我还得安心生产啊！”
    在开展抗美援朝生产竞赛时，老臧更鼓足了劲，他经常研究宣传方法，注意大家听什么感到兴趣，讲什么能打动群众的心。他把群众的心理摸透了，才开始做。有一天，他到精矿组去，碰到孙万顺，顺便和他谈了一句，他说：“老孙，美国军队在朝鲜那也不像世道啦！”老孙紧跟着就追问：“又怎么的啦？”他就把美军在朝鲜强奸妇女，杀死多少群众讲了一遍，老孙一听可气坏了，恨的咬牙切齿地说：“美国鬼子太不人道啦，打仗打仗，为什么强奸妇女，杀害百姓，这种野兽，不打死是不行的。”在他们谈话时，许多人都围拢来了，老臧就提高嗓门说：“大老美这个家伙野心太大，他不光侵略朝鲜，还想到咱们东北来，现在志愿部队到朝鲜就是为了保卫咱们祖国，保卫咱们家乡，不让这些野兽来侵犯咱。”他这几句话把大家激动了，有人说：“咱们得想个办法把老美赶出朝鲜去”，他瞧大家劲头上来时，立即把话头转到正题上来说：“办法有，现在的抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛，就是为了打大老美，咱们加紧生产，多出一吨精矿就等于抽他一根筋，用生产成绩对付他。”大家接着说：“老臧讲的对，咱得加油干，打垮这个王八蛋。”
    鸡西煤矿宣传员全矿一等模范杨春华同志，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动初期，他编了一首快板：“杜鲁门，真混蛋，到朝鲜，来捣乱。志愿军，去参战，打它旗倒兵又散。同志们，加油干，多出煤炭，顶炸弹。”工人念着快板，刨起煤来越干越有劲。可是还有一小部分人没积极参加劳动竞赛，他就用启发的方式画了一幅奖励模范大会的图画；先进的工人带着光荣花坐在主席台上，落后的工人低着头站在台下，并给起了个名字叫“想办法”。落后的工人一看就知道是自己，真丢人；于是纷纷“想办法”提高生产，全坑工人都参加了竞赛。当着落后的一旦进步了，他马上就表扬鼓励巩固成绩。如工人杨慈云，三年来一贯落后，竞赛时产量突然提高到全坑第一，他又编首快板贴出去：“杨慈云，真不赖，一心要得大红旗，上半月，不积极，稀里糊涂过了去。不上火，不着急，成天每日闹脾气。本月挑战对了敌，上旬全坑他第一。别看从前落了后，现在还得向他来学习。”经过杨春华同志的宣传，工人的劲头像拧绳一样，越拧越紧，生产任务平均每月超过百分之五十，和前三季度勉强完成任务大不相同。坑长一见杨春华同志就说：“真行，到底把煤给宣传出来了。”
    黑龙江肇东九区大平山村宣传员支部书记许成林同志，他是该村宣传员小组长。当美帝国主义发起侵略战争以后，在过去的宣传工作基础上，开展了抗美援朝的时事宣传运动。在开始宣传时，由于光宣传美国鬼子残暴，有些老乡听了就怕美国，还有的背地说：“在朝鲜打他的呗，和咱们有啥关系？！”坏人乘机造谣，影响老乡有些人大吃大喝起来。根据这种情况，经过党团员和宣传员大会的研究，决定应该着重宣传“为什么说人民必胜，美帝国主义必败”和“中朝人民是什么关系”两个问题。会后分了工，许成林同志到太平山屯给老乡讲：“美帝国主义是纸老虎，我们一定能打垮它的侵略”，可是老乡听完连声也没吱就散会了，他一想这是讲的太简单的毛病。接受这个教训，第二天他到立起牌屯宣传，拿伪满十四年的痛苦生活和共产党领导几年来的生活举出事对比，会场特别安静，讲到美帝国主义又来侵略我们的时候，老乡们喊：“我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略！”的口号。接着他又讲：我们中国人民已经站起来了，有毛主席的领导，有四亿七千五百万人民，有五百万强大的国防军。还详细讲了美帝国主义几个致命弱点。当场有七八名老乡抢着要出担架。团员岳武臣当时报名参加志愿军，从这以后鼓起老乡热爱祖国的劲头，不到五天工夫有十四名青年农民报名参加志愿军，六名老乡志愿出担架去朝鲜。但在这中间老乡产生了搞副业不是“抗美援朝”的错误看法，于是他就在冬学里向群众说明了搞副业是抗美援朝的物质力量，生产要搞不好，只能打今天仗，不能打明天仗。还编了个口号：“搞副业积极干，美国鬼子就完蛋！”到处宣传。不到两天老乡都搞起副业了。王喜峰打住一个黄皮子进屯就喊：“打住一个美国鬼子！”他向大家宣传说：“多打黄皮子多卖钱，美国鬼子垮台在眼前。”平壤解放的消息传到该村，群众乐的直蹦高，自愿拿肥猪、小鸡和现款来慰问志愿军。可是平世荣说：“这回可没事啦，咱们头年准保把它打完蛋。”支部一研究觉得这是群众在胜利声中产生的麻痹松劲思想，宣传员又分头下去向群众解释：应当继续努力缴好公粮，搞好副业，支援抗美援朝斗争到最后胜利，不应当松劲。
    吉林蛟河南岗村支部，在十二月间一次支委会上，研究了宣传员提供的情况，发现村民冯钟曾经说过：朝鲜人是二日本子，若是让他们“得了地”，咱们又得拉倒，村里还有些老年人对抗美援朝想不通，“同意抗美，不同意援朝”，支委会认为这是一个重要思想问题，特别是村里朝鲜人占的比重很大，不解决这个问题，每一个任务的完成都受限制，抗美援朝的积极性没法发挥，就决定集中力量解决这个问题。会后，宣传员分头召集了屯民大会，讲解了中朝人民许多年来的血肉关系，并举出了支委会上研究的例子，指出过去日本鬼子利用韩奸挑拨中朝人民团结，又讲了今天中朝人民“唇亡齿寒，户破堂危”的道理，全村的中朝老乡都开窍了。从此以后，村里变了样，过去中国农民帮助朝鲜农民运送公粮时，得先得到脚钱，现在连提也不提，五更半夜，就到朝鲜老乡家里装车。
    辽西新民刘家村宣传员支部书记杜溶洁同志，是个很能深入群众的宣传员。有一次本村贫农邸成才见到学生扭秧歌时，就不耐烦地说：“你们还乐呢？也不看看现在到什么时候啦！”这说明他对时局不太清楚，有些悲观。其他宣传员向他讲形势，但他不信。杜溶洁同志知道了就亲自向他宣传解释。她从邸成才小时放猪，长大扛活受苦讲起，一直讲到解放以后，邸成才分了房子分了地，现在过着不愁吃不愁烧的好日子，随后又讲到美国鬼子侵略朝鲜的目的，和我们有力量来打败美帝国主义的进攻。经过她反复地耐心地说服，邸成才才明白了。并表示：“我一定要和美国鬼子干到底，坚决跟着共产党走！”
    经辽西新民营防村宣传员妇女主任崔雅君同志，她常用唠喀的方式进行时事宣传。当美军在仁川登陆后，有些老乡说：“美帝纸老虎变成真老虎了。”她就向群众宣传说：“美帝战线太长，后方供应不上，就像人得喉巴病一样，气力不足，上气不接下气，再说美国兵有许多是穷人，不愿为资本家卖命，就像咱们贫雇中农不愿给地主卖命一样，所以说美帝国主义仍然是纸老虎。”有一个老头说：“纸老虎，朝鲜军队怎往后退呢？”她说：“大爷，比方说你这么大个子，我比你小打不过你，可是来四五个就打过你了吧？在仁川美国四五万人，朝鲜两千人。用二十比一的兵，这叫好汉不吃眼前亏，朝鲜撤后些，找机会再消灭它。”老头点头服了她的理。又有老乡说：“咱们的陆军世界无比，可是美国飞机多，原子弹厉害呀！”她说：“前年十三大队从咱村过，国民党飞机扔十几个炸弹，大家都匿起来了，一个也没伤着，再说咱们也有飞机，苏联老大哥也有原子弹，咱怕它干啥？”老乡一听，都说：“对呀，这姑娘真懂事理。”
    松江汤原西大桥村宣传员于江同志，是该村宣传员小组长，复员军人，任副村长。他在领导方法上，非常重视宣传工作，他说：“话不说不透，沙锅不打不漏，什么事也得先搞通思想。”当朝鲜战争紧张时，群众一时思想混乱，心不托底，有的争买洋油、洋火、食盐等日用品，他看到了这个情况，知道群众对敌我力量对比认识不足，对美国纸老虎还看不清楚，有的怕美国“家什”好，于是他就结合一九四六年他自己参军的经验，向群众进行宣传说：“我当兵那时候，每个人给两个手榴弹，几十颗子弹，吃穿都不好，就凭我们是人民的军队，为人民去打仗，后来都使上美国武器了。光“家什”好可不行，好“家什”还得看谁使。”并向群众说明：“咱们有五百万人民解放军，打垮了美国武器武装起来的蒋介石，美国鬼子敢来就能消灭它。别看朝鲜人民军眼下撤退，咱们过去刚光复那时候，不是国民党也挺能吹呼吗？”群众听了他的宣传后都说：“光复那咱那样，咱还胜利了呢，何况眼下我们有强大的军队呢！”经他这一宣传全村群众情绪都转过来了。
    大连市宣传员中山区友好广场坊的妇联主任吴金凤同志，有一次她利用修理皮鞋的一点时间，就和皮鞋匠唠起生活情形来。鞋匠说：“现在生活可真好了，一家人都吃饱穿暖，坐在这里修鞋，再没有人拿棍子驱赶，也再没有修鞋不给钱还要打人的顾客了。”但是这些好处怎样得来的？皮鞋匠就不大清楚了。于是吴金凤就告诉他：共产党如何领导群众艰苦地向帝国主义及反动派作斗争，毛主席如何领导红军二万五千里长征，过雪山草地时，缺粮食只吃野草等故事。并说这一切全是为了要帮助穷人翻身过好日子。鞋匠感动得要流泪。她这才联系到抗美援朝运动，使鞋匠深深体会到：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，也是多么关联着他一家的生活。
    黑龙江安广县宣传员刘学诗同志（机关干部），他在交易场的宣传站上经常对农民进行时事宣传，出黑板报，写消息，经常准备形势图和漫画等。他通过这些形式，向农民解释：“美国鬼子走日本鬼子老道，先侵略朝鲜再侵略中国，站起来了的中国人民是不能忍受这个的，为了保卫好日子，才志愿去担架。”讲地图漫画时，就向老乡说：“美国鬼子在朝鲜奸淫、烧杀、轰炸、破坏，把汉城变成活地狱，尽办的是牲口事。”讲到麦克阿瑟释放日本战犯时，他说：“过去日本鬼子要国兵，要劳工，要奉仕，思想犯、经济犯、国事犯，不和狼一样吗？他把祸害中国人民的狼都放啦，是和咱不共戴天的仇，咱不能让他。”
    辽东岫岩香炉区区联社成立了宣传站，许宝珊经理、吴维帮副经理很重视宣传工作，他们能结合群众切身利益进行时事宣传，效果颇大。在朝鲜战争紧张时期，群众发生恐慌，每天都有四、五十人挤满了区联社，抱着存货不存钱的态度，抢买货物，更有人大吃大喝，并问：“以前布价二万三千元，为什么现在卖二万六千元呢？”于是许经理就向群众解释说：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，企图是侵略中国，我们必须来提防，充分准备战勤工作，运输困难，货物便贵，这都是美国鬼子给我们造成的。”又指着布、面、油、盐、酒等货物说：这都是中国的好产品，成色这样好，过去在日本鬼子统治时代，谁能穿这样的布，吃这样的面，喝这样的酒呢？还不是高高在上的警察、特务、地主、恶霸紧紧的把握着吗？咱们穷苦哥们穿点家织布还不是经济犯吗？”他以实物摆在群众面前教育群众，所以买货的人很受感动，一面听着一面沉思过去。他接着说：美国鬼子是要走日本的老路，要霸占咱们的好日子。朱家村老朱头在听许经理的宣传后，便把暂时用不着的钱，马上买了一双乌拉准备出担架。他又说：“现在的合作社完全是为咱们自己办事的，优待社员，多咱都有社员优先买货权，如果现在胡乱花，将来就要吃亏。”“在共产党领导下的合作社是一天一天的向前发展，咱们的生活就能越发提高。”这样结合本身业务结合群众切身利益进行宣传，不但提高了群众爱国主义精神，同时也提高了群众对合作社的认识，不但减轻了大吃大喝浪费现象，也提高了群众对合作社投资的热情。
