A letter from the farmers in Sanhe Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province:

Respectable Chairman Mao:

We are the collective farmers of Sanhe Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province. We want to report to you that we have now been emancipated. The farmers here have been saying for generations, "If you have three mu and three fen of land, you won't have to worry about food or clothing." However, for many generations, many farmers simply could not get "three mu and three fen of land."

After Chairman Mao led us to liberation, this year we really received land, averaging about three mu and six fen per person. Chairman Mao, we are truly grateful to you. In the future, we must do three things well to thank you: First, carefully guard against the landlords' sabotage and counter-attacks, and protect our fruits of victory. Second, cultivate carefully, and strive to increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp, to increase the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea. Third, study culture, improve our knowledge, and be the people of the new China. We wish you good health!

The Collective Farmers of Sanhe Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province

　　湖北江陵县三合乡农民感谢毛主席领导他们分了地敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是湖北江陵县三合乡的全体农民。我们要向您报告，我们现在已经翻身了。我们这里的农民，一辈子念说着：“有地三亩三，不愁吃、不愁穿”。但是，经过多少辈子了，很多农民们就是弄不到“三亩三分地”。
    毛主席领导我们获得解放以后，今年我们真的分到了土地，平均每人有三亩六分上下。毛主席，我们真感激您。今后我们一定要做好三件事来感谢您：一、小心提防地主的破坏和反攻，保护好我们的胜利果实。二、精耕细作，努力增产粮食和棉、麻等工业原料，来增加抗美援朝的力量。三、学习文化，提高知识，做新中国的人民。祝您健康！
                                       湖北江陵县三合乡全体农民
