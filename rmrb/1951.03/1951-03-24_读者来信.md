　　Reader's Letters
　　For more than two years after liberation, the porters of Taiyuan City
　　Still suffer from illegal exploitation by feudal headmen
　　The Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions is now leading workers in struggle

Editor:
　　During the period of Japanese puppet, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan's rule, the more than five thousand porters in Taiyuan City suffered miserably from the exploitation of feudal headmen. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the feudal headmen still did not repent, and continued to do evil, monopolizing the porterage business. They exploited more than 70% of the porterage fees. This not only increased the transportation costs of the state and merchants, but also seriously harmed the interests of the workers, making their income insufficient to maintain their lives. Headmen Shi Desheng, Bi Chengyao, and others controlled more than 600 horse-drawn carts and monopolized the freight transport of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the inner city, the suburbs, and the east and west mountain coal mines. In order to resist the government's establishment of a porterage company, Shi Desheng disguised his exploitative organization as a "Horse-drawn Cart Mutual Aid Group." On the surface, it stipulated a handling fee of 2.5% of the freight, but in reality, the exploitation still reached more than 50% of the freight price. Even the personal freedom of the workers was deprived. When workers went to Jingle to transport ore, they had to have a note from him as proof, and each note cost 48 jin of millet. Headman Bi Chengyao did not treat workers as human beings. Last autumn, five workers fell into the water and drowned while quarrying stones for him. He ignored it and watched the workers' bodies being eaten by dogs. These feudal headmen not only illegally exploited the workers, but also stole state property. Headman Shi Desheng contracted to transport 1,000 cubic meters of sand for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, but actually only transported 700 cubic meters, and embezzled the freight for 300 cubic meters of sand. Last October, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant bought 1,000 wooden piles in the city at 90 jin of millet per pile, and contracted the transport to headman Tian Yu. Tian Yu actually stole and sold the batch of wooden piles for 170 jin of millet per pile in the middle of the journey, and bought bad wood to replace them at a price of 70 jin of millet per pile, and threatened the workers not to say anything. Headman Guo Yingru transported 6 million jin of grain to the transportation company this February, and exploited the workers by 900,000 jin of millet in one trip from Changzhi to Taigu. The workers reflected: "Seven-sheng dou, eight-he sheng, thirteen-liang scale, you will be cheated by officials everywhere." Zheng Chengrong, the headman of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's outsourced loading and unloading work, controlled more than 200 loading and unloading workers, allowing them to exploit and oppress them. His second-in-command's monthly exploitation income was more than three to four thousand jin of millet. Worker Guo Wenhua was beaten for being dissatisfied with their harsh exploitation. Similar situations are numerous.
　　It has been nearly two years since the liberation of Taiyuan, and these feudal headmen are still rampaging so lawlessly that the workers can no longer tolerate it. Now the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions has led the workers to rise up in a struggle against the headmen. The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government has accepted the demands of the city's workers and arrested the heinous headmen Shi Desheng, Bi Chengyao, Xu Lin, etc.

　　Editor's Note: It is good that the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions has begun to pay attention to leading the porters in the anti-headman struggle. However, as early as March 24th of last year, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government passed the "Provisional Measures on Abolishing the Feudal Headman System in the Transportation Industry in Various Regions," instructing local governments to establish unified transportation companies, abolish the feudal headman system in the transportation industry in various cities, so as to protect the livelihood of the porters, eliminate obstacles to the smooth flow of goods, and facilitate the development of production and economic prosperity. This shows that the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions does not care enough about the interests of the workers, which is worthy of attention in future work.

　　The Trade Union Represents the Interests of Workers and Files a Complaint with the Government
　　Capitalists Who Abuse Workers are Punished

Editor:
　　Since liberation, there are still a few private manufacturers in Beijing who beat and scold workers wantonly, treating them as slaves, and seriously violating the policies and laws of the People's Government. For example, during the Lantern Festival, Wu Zhusan, the manager of Julong Oil, Salt, and Grain Store in Nanxiaojie, District Four, ate with the workers. He became angry because the workers ate too much food and overturned the table. The next day, he also beat Nie Zhizhong, a worker making vinegar. Li Fengwen, the second shopkeeper of Shuanghecheng Iron Shop in Nanda Street, Xinjiekou, often abused Yang Chunxu, an 18-year-old apprentice. Yang Chunxu was young and had not joined the trade union, and his awareness was not high. Every time he was abused, he had to swallow his anger. But Li Fengwen became even more arrogant. On the evening of the 24th of the twelfth lunar month last year, Yang Chunxu was drinking water when Li Fengwen asked him to work. Yang didn't go immediately, so Li beat Yang's hands twenty times severely and threatened him, "If you tell anyone, I will beat you five more times." On the 29th of the twelfth lunar month, Yang Chunxu went to get a haircut. Because the barber shop was too busy during the New Year, he came back a little late and was scolded by Li Fengwen. In the afternoon, he asked Yang Chunxu to buy half a dozen paper foils. Because the paper shop didn't sell half a dozen, Yang Chunxu bought a dozen. Because of this, Li Fengwen stepped on Yang Chunxu on the ground and beat him until Yang could not breathe. On the evening of the second day of the Spring Festival, Li Fengwen asked Yang Chunxu to repair a welding iron chair. Because Yang Chunxu was not skilled, he had not welded it well by twelve o'clock at night. Li Fengwen was furious and forced Yang Chunxu to kowtow ten times, causing several purple bruises to swell on Yang Chunxu's head. Afterwards, Yang often had headaches and dizziness, but Li Fengwen refused to pay for medical expenses.
　　After learning about these situations, the District Fourteen Office of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions immediately represented the workers and asked the government to punish these illegal manufacturers. Wu Zhusan, the manager of Julong Store, has been educated by the Public Security Bureau for a week, wrote a letter of repentance to the government, and guaranteed that he would not commit such errors in the future. After returning to the store, he apologized and admitted his mistake to all the workers in the store. Li Fengwen, the second shopkeeper of Shuanghecheng Iron Shop, has been sent to the court for legal processing because of his more serious crimes.

　　Editor's Note: Under the leadership of the People's Government, private manufacturers are absolutely not allowed to continue to implement feudal abuse against workers. It is correct for the District Fourteen Office of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions to represent the interests of the working class and file a complaint with the government. It is hoped that workers, trade union workers, and readers who care about workers in various places will write more letters to expose this illegal behavior of abusing workers.

    解放二年多的太原市搬运工人
    依然遭受封建把头非法削剥
    太原市总工会现已领导工人进行斗争编辑同志：
    在日伪蒋阎统治时期，太原市的五千余名搬运工人，曾惨遭封建把头的削剥。太原解放后，封建把头仍不知悔改，依然为非作恶，把持搬运事业。他们剥削搬运费达百分之七十以上。这不仅增加国家及商贩的运价开支，而且严重地危害了工人利益，使工人收入不能维持生活。把头施得生、毕承尧等控制六百多辆马车，把持了太原钢铁厂、城内、市郊和东西山煤矿的货运。施得生为了对抗政府成立搬运公司，改头换面地把他的剥削组织改称为“马车互助组”，表面规定抽运费百分之二点五的手续费，实际上暗中剥削仍达运价的百分之五十以上。甚至工人的人身自由都被剥夺，工人到静乐搬运矿石，一定要他开字据证明，每张字据要收四十八斤小米。把头毕承尧不把工人当人看待，去年秋天五个工人在给他打石子时失足坠水被淹死。他理也不理，看着工人的尸体被狗啃吃。这些封建把头，不仅非法剥削工人，还盗骗国家财产。把头施得生包运太原钢铁厂一千方砂子，实际只拉走了七百方，私吞了三百方砂子的运费。去年十月份太原钢铁厂在城内以每根九十斤小米买了一千根木桩，由把头田钰包运。田钰竟在中途以每根一百七十斤小米将该批木桩盗卖了，又以七十斤小米一根的价钱购买坏木料顶替，并且威胁工人“不准吭声”。把头郭英儒今年二月份给运输公司运粮六百万斤，从长治到太谷一次就剥削工人九十万斤小米。工人反映：“七升斗、八合升、十三两秤、走遍天下逢官碰。”太原钢铁厂装卸外包工把头郑成荣控制了二百多装卸工人，任其剥削压迫，在他手下的二把头，每月剥削所得在三、四千斤小米以上。工友郭文华因不满他们苛重的剥削，竟遭到毒打。类似以上情况多得很。
    太原解放已将近两年了，这些封建把头还这样无法无天地横行霸道，工人实在不能容忍下去。现太原市总工会已领导工人起来作反把头斗争。太原市人民政府已接受全市工人的要求，逮捕了罪大恶极的把头施得生、毕承尧、许林等。

    编者按：太原市总工会开始注意领导搬运工人进行反把头斗争是好的。但是中央人民政府政务院早在去年三月二十四日即通过了“关于废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度暂行处理办法”，指令各地由人民政府设立统一搬运公司，废除各城市搬运事业中的封建把头制度，以保护搬运工人的生活，扫除货物畅通的障碍，以便利发展生产，繁荣经济。这说明了太原市总工会对工人利益还不够关心，这是值得在今后工作中引起注意的。
    工会代表工人利益向政府提出控告
    虐待工人的资方受到惩办编辑同志：
    解放以来，北京市仍有少数私营厂商，无法无天地打骂工人，把工人当做奴隶看待，严重地违犯了人民政府的政策法令。如：四区南小街聚隆油盐粮店经理武祝三在旧历灯节时和工人一起吃饭，嫌工人多吃了菜，就发脾气掀了饭桌子。第二天他并动手打做醋工人聂治中。新街口南大街双合成铁铺二掌柜李凤文，经常虐待十八岁的学徒杨春旭。杨春旭年小又未加入工会，觉悟不高，他每次受了虐待只好忍气吞声。但李凤文却因此更加蛮横。去年旧历十二月二十四晚上，杨春旭正在喝水，李凤文叫杨去干活，杨没马上去，李就狠狠地打了杨二十手板，还威胁他说：“要是说给人家知道就再打五板”。十二月二十九日杨春旭去理发，因过年理发店活太忙，回来稍迟，就被李凤文臭骂了一顿。下午叫杨春旭去买半打纸箔，因纸店不卖半打，杨春旭就买了一打。为此，李凤文就用脚将杨春旭踩在地上，打得杨喘不过气来。在春节初二的晚上，李凤文叫杨春旭修焊一把铁椅子，杨春旭因为技术不熟练，到夜间十二点还没有焊好。李凤文大怒，逼迫杨春旭磕十个响头，把杨春旭头上磕起了几个紫青的大泡。以后杨经常头痛发晕，李凤文竟不支付药费。
    北京市总工会十四区办事处了解这些情况后，即代表工人要求政府惩办这些不法厂商。聚隆号经理武祝三已由公安局教育了一个星期，向政府写了悔过书，保证今后不再犯此类错误，他回柜后又向全柜工人道歉认错。双合成铁铺二掌柜李凤文因罪行较严重，已被送法院依法处理。
                                   读者  刘长汉  张奇生
    编者按：在人民政府的领导下，决不允许私营厂商对工人继续施行封建虐待。北京市总工会十四区办事处能代表工人阶级利益，向政府提出控告是正确的。希望各地工人同志们、工会工作者及关心工人的读者多多来信，揭露这种虐待工人的违法行为。
