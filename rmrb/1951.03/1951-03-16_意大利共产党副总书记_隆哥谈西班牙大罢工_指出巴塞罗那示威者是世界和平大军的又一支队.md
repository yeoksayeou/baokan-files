Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 14th: TASS reported that the Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, Longo, made a statement to a reporter from Unità regarding the Barcelona events, saying: The significant social and political importance of the Barcelona events is very evident. Judging from newspaper reports, this is not merely a matter of various working people holding strikes, but a powerful demonstration by the entire people against rising living costs (the direct cause of this movement) and against Franco's entire economic policy and dictatorship (the overall political cause). Even bourgeois news agencies were forced to point out the "genuine political significance" of this event, which "local observers did not overlook," and were forced to admit that "the situation is very serious."

Such a broad and powerful popular movement as the one that occurred in Barcelona would be of great importance if it occurred in any capitalist country. However, because this happened in Spain, where tyrannical fascist terror is rampant, it further illustrates that the situation in this country is even more serious than the events reported in the newspapers. The correlation between the Barcelona demonstrations and the crisis of the Atlantic system is obvious and undeniable. The popular movement in Barcelona shares a common starting point with the events that have occurred in Italy, France, and other countries in the Atlantic bloc that are most threatened in recent months: the people are rising up against the war policies implemented by American imperialism and its accomplices in various countries.

Longo continued: Although Franco's Spain is not yet a member of the Atlantic Alliance, it is also being pulled into the American aggressive bloc. Therefore, the Barcelona demonstrators are another contingent in the army of peace warriors who are fighting around the world to defeat the warmongers. The protests of the people of Barcelona were expected. Even after the establishment of the Franco regime, the Spanish people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have never ceased their resistance against the dictatorship. Just as in Italy under the Mussolini regime, the Spanish Communists, together with the most outstanding Republicans, have never interrupted their agitation and organizational work in rural areas and factories, and even in Falangist organizations, trade unions, and other mass organizations.

The Barcelona events are the result of the dedication of the Communists and the most outstanding Spanish democrats to the cause of freedom and peace.

　　意大利共产党副总书记
    隆哥谈西班牙大罢工
    指出巴塞罗那示威者是世界和平大军的又一支队
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社罗马十四日讯：意大利共产党副总书记隆哥就巴塞罗那事件向团结报记者发表谈话说：巴塞罗那事件的重大的社会与政治意义是很显著的。从报纸的消息来判断，这不仅是各种劳动人民举行罢工的问题，而且是全体人民反对生活费用上涨（促成这次运动的直接原因）和反对佛朗哥的整个经济政策与独裁（总的政治原因）的有力的示威。甚至资产阶级的通讯社也被迫指出“当地观察家所未予忽视的”这次事件的“真正政治意义”，也被迫承认“局势是很严重的”。
    像在巴塞罗那发生的这种广泛而强大的人民运动，如果发生在任何资本主义国家中，都是具有巨大重要性的事。然而，由于这件事是发生在暴虐的法西斯恐怖猖獗的西班牙，就更加说明了这个国家里的局势比报纸所报道的事件还要严重。巴塞罗那的示威与大西洋系统的危机两者之间的相互关系，是明显的，不可置辩的。巴塞罗那的人民运动与受到最大危险的威胁的意大利、法国以及大西洋集团的其他国家中最近几个月发生的事件，都有一个共同的开端：人民起来反对美帝国主义及其在各国的同谋犯所实行的战争政策。
    隆哥继称：虽然佛朗哥西班牙还不是大西洋联盟的一员，然而它也正在被拉进美国侵略集团，因此，巴塞罗那的示威者乃是正在世界各地为击败战争贩子而奋斗的和平战士大军的又一个支队。巴塞罗那人民的抗议是在预料中的。甚至在佛朗哥政权建立了以后，西班牙人民在共产党领导下为反对独裁而进行的抵抗，也从来没有停止过。正像意大利在墨索里尼政权下的情形一样，西班牙共产党人与最优秀的共和分子一道，从来没有中断过他们在农村和工厂，甚至在长枪党组织、工会、以及其他群众团体中的鼓动与组织工作。
    巴塞罗那事件是共产党人与最优秀的西班牙民主人士竭忠于自由与和平事业的结果。
