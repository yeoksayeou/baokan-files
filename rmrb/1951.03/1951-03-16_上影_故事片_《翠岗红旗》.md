1933, in the old Red area of Jiangxi, a place called Jiangying.
    Young Jiang Mengzi and his newlywed wife Xiang Wu'er, along with his younger sister Linzi, his father Jiang Chunwang (the chairman of Jiangying Township), and Mengzi's aunt Jiang Sanniang (a glorious Red Army family member whose three sons joined the army), live happily and diligently in Jiangying.
    At that time, the Red Army had crushed Chiang Kai-shek's four offensives. A certain brigade returned victoriously. The brigade commander said that the Chiang bandits would never give up and might launch even larger offensives. Thus, the call to expand the Red Army spread everywhere. During the expansion rally, Jiang Chunwang called on the young people to join the army. The glorious Red Army family member Jiang Sanniang denounced the Chiang bandits at the rally, demanding that the young people avenge her two sacrificed sons; Mengzi was the first to stand up and sign up.
    For a time, the registration for joining the army was very enthusiastic. After Mengzi signed up, his wife Xiang Wu'er was very happy and encouraged Mengzi to work hard to kill the enemy, so as to avenge her dead father (who was killed by Xiao Zhenkui, the head of Chiang Kai-shek's "Communist Eradication Corps") and the millions of suffering people.

    1934, the Red Army went on the Long March, and Mengzi went north with the army. When he left his hometown, he resolutely said: "I must come back!" After the Red Army left, the reactionaries entered the old Red area, robbing and burning, doing everything evil. Red Army family members suffered at the hands of Xiao Zhenkui. Jiang Chunwang sacrificed heroically, and Linzi was also shot. Wu'er fled to a neighboring county. In order to raise her newborn child, she worked as a wet nurse in the house of the landlord Feng Zhigu, living a life worse than that of a beast of burden.

    The landlord Feng Zhigu was Xiao Zhenkui's accomplice, bullying others and committing all kinds of evil in the local area, forcibly conscripting young men, extorting and blackmailing, making it impossible for young people to survive in the countryside, so they all fled to the mountains to join the guerrillas.

    Xiao Zhenkui and Feng Zhigu received a secret report from a lackey, and secretly dispatched troops at night in an attempt to wipe out the guerrillas. Xiang Ma (Wu'er) heard the news, and Wu'er rushed to the house of the poor peasant Feng Lao Si to ask him to quickly send a message to the guerrillas. Therefore, when the bandit troops tried to sneak attack the guerrillas, they were surrounded by the guerrillas and countless bandit troops were annihilated. This news greatly alarmed Xiao and Feng. As a result, they arrested Feng Chuangang's father, Feng Lao Si, and tortured him in an attempt to find clues. In the end, Feng Lao Si would rather die than speak, leaving Xiao and Feng with nothing.

    In the midst of deep water and scorching fire, Wu'er's belief in the revolution remained the same.
    She believed that "Chairman Mao will return, and the Red Army will definitely return!" Years later, her son Xiao Hong had grown up.

    The Red Army did return. The People's Liberation Army marched south. Xiao Zhenkui looted a large amount of supplies and civilians, and fled to the steep Cuigang Mountain, dreaming of putting up a last-ditch resistance. The People's Liberation Army left a division to suppress the bandits. The division commander Jiang Yonghong was none other than Jiang Mengzi of that year. He passed by Jiangying and saw that his family was destroyed, leaving only a blind aunt, Jiang Sanniang.

    At that time, Wu'er and her son were also forced to go up the mountain. Wu'er told Xiao Hong about her life experience and asked Xiao Hong to sneak down the mountain at night to find the People's Liberation Army. Xiao Hong left, and Wu'er was arrested, enduring torture without yielding, angrily cursing Xiao and Feng to die before her eyes.

    Xiao Hong arrived at the division headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and met his father, Division Commander Jiang Yonghong (Mengzi). The division commander and chief of staff, based on the materials from the guerrillas and Xiao Hong, arranged a major encirclement and suppression.

    Victory! The red flag was finally planted on Cuigang Mountain. Feng Zhigu was killed, Xiao Zhenkui was captured alive, and Mengzi, Wu'er, and Xiao Hong were reunited. After fifteen years of dark rule, the people of the old Red area of Jiangxi finally saw the light of day again and were liberated.

    一九三三年，在江西老红区，一个叫江营的地方。
  少年江猛子和他的新婚的妻子向五儿，还有他的妹妹林仔，父亲江春旺（是江营乡的主席），还有猛子的婶母江三娘，（是个三子参军的光荣红军家属），他们在江营愉快而勤劳的生活着。
  那时，红军粉碎了蒋介石的四次进攻，某大队胜利归来，大队长说蒋匪决不会死心，还可能发动更大的进攻，于是扩大红军的号召在四处传扬，就在扩红大会上，江春旺号召青年们参军。光荣红军家属江三娘在大会上控诉蒋匪，要求青年们为她牺牲了的两个儿子复仇；猛子第一个站起来报了名。
  一时报名参军的非常踊跃。猛子报名以后，他妻子向五儿非常高兴，鼓励猛子努力去杀敌，好为她死去的父亲，（为蒋匪“铲共团”团长萧镇魁所杀害）以及成千成万苦难的人民复仇。
     一九四四年，红军长征，猛子也随军北上了。他离开家乡的时候，坚决地说：“我一定要回来的！”红军走后，反动派进入老红区，抢掠焚烧，无所不为，红军家属都遭萧镇魁的毒手。江春旺壮烈的牺牲了，林仔也被枪杀了。五儿逃亡到了邻县，为了抚养新出世的孩子，在地主封之固家里当奶妈，过着牛马不如的生活。
     地主封之固是萧镇魁的爪牙，在地方上仗势欺人，无恶不作，强拉壮丁，威逼勒索，使青年们在乡里无法生存，纷纷都逃亡山中参加了游击队。
     萧镇魁、封之固得到了走狗的密报，黑夜派兵企图去消灭游击队，这消息为向妈（五儿）听到了，五儿赶到贫农封老四的家里要他赶快送信给游击队。因此，当匪军们偷袭游击队的时候，被游击队反包围，歼灭了无数匪军；这消息使萧、封他们大为惊恐，于是把游击队长封传刚的父亲封老四抓来苦刑逼供；企图找出线索，结果封老四宁死不说，使萧、封他们毫无所获。
     在水深火热之中，五儿对革命的信念始终如一。
  她相信“毛主席要回来的，红军一定要回来的！”几年后，她的儿子小鸿已经长大了。
     红军果然回来了。人民解放大军南下，萧镇魁劫掠了大批物资和老百姓，逃上险峻的翠岗山，梦想负隅顽抗。解放军留下了一师人剿匪，师长江永宏不是别人，正是当年的江猛子，他路过江营，看看家破人亡，只剩下一个双目已瞎的婶母江三娘。
     那时候，五儿母子也被逼上山，五儿把自己的身世告诉了小鸿，叫小鸿深夜偷下山去找解放军。小鸿走了，五儿被捕，受酷刑而不屈，怒骂萧、封二匪死在眼前。
     小鸿到了解放军师部，见到了他父亲江永宏师长（猛子）。师长、参谋长根据了游击队以及小鸿的材料，布置了一次大的围剿。
     胜利了！翠岗山上终于插上了红旗，封之固被打死，萧镇魁活捉了，猛子、五儿、小鸿团聚了。江西老红区的人民经过了十五年的黑暗统治，终于重见天日，得到了解放。
