    Injury, Disability, Sickness, and Death are Now Guaranteed
    Should Work Hard and Increase Production
    Comrade Editor:
    The Labor Insurance Regulations have been promulgated by our government. From now on, the working class has guarantees against injury, disability, sickness, and death. This is truly a great joyous event for the Chinese working class. The People's Government, at a time when the nation's financial and economic situation has just begun to improve, has used the law to protect the interests of our working class. Only our own government can do this. As glorious postal workers of the Chinese working class, how should we welcome the happiness given to us by our government? I personally guarantee to do the following: (1) Increase work enthusiasm and actively participate in production competitions under the leadership of the trade union. (2) Establish a professional mindset and strive for over twenty-five years of seniority in our enterprise.
              Postal Worker Zhou Kunian

    伤、残、病、死有了保障
    应该安心工作提高生产编辑同志：
    劳动保险条例已经由咱们的政府公布了。从此工人阶级的伤、残、病、死有了保障。这真是中国工人阶级的大喜事。人民政府在国家的财政经济刚刚开始好转的今天，就以法律保障了我们工人阶级的利益，这只有我们自己的政府才能这样做。作为光荣的中国工人阶级的邮政职工，应该怎样来迎接我们政府所给予我们的幸福呢？我个人保证做到：（一）提高工作积极性，在工会领导下，积极参加生产竞赛。（二）树立专业化的思想，争取二十五年以上的本企业工龄。
