　　Continue Efforts to Promote Local Products
    According to materials from North China, since the North China Local Products Promotion Conference last November, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia have universally launched local products promotion campaigns. As of now, local products with existing sales channels have been sold out, and a significant amount of slow-moving local products have also been sold. This has played a significant role in stimulating the urban and rural economies, stabilizing market prices, increasing farmers' purchasing power, stimulating industrial and commercial development, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, ensuring state tax revenue, strengthening unity with private merchants, and combating the "economic blockade" conspiracy of American imperialism. The preliminary summary of Pingyuan Province's local products promotion work over the past three months, published in this newspaper today, fully illustrates the aforementioned effects.
    Currently, there are still some local products in North China that have not been sold. It is hoped that the party and government leading organs of each province will firmly grasp the leadership of this work, promote the existing experience, and actively find sales channels for slow-moving local products from all aspects. Incorrect understandings such as belittling commerce, thinking of high prices, valuing popular goods, neglecting unpopular goods, valuing plains, neglecting mountainous areas, valuing large quantities, and neglecting small quantities must be thoroughly corrected so as to further popularize the local products promotion movement to every village and every city.

　　继续努力推销土产
    根据华北的材料，自从去年十一月华北推销土产会议后，河北、平原、山西、察哈尔、绥远和内蒙各地均普遍展开了推销土产运动，截至目前止，有销路的土产已经推销完，滞销的土产亦已卖出很大数量。这对活跃城乡经济，稳定市场物价，提高农民购买力，刺激工商业发展，增强工农联盟，保证国家税收，和加强对私商的团结以及对美帝国主义“经济封锁”阴谋的打击等方面，均起了极大的作用。今天本报发表的平原省三个月来推销土产工作的初步总结，正充分说明了上述作用。
    现在全华北尚有一部分土产没有销出，希望各省党政领导机关，要抓紧对这一工作的领导，发扬已有的经验，积极地从各方面为滞销土产找销路。那些轻视商业、高价思想、重视热货、忽视冷货、重视平原、忽视山地、重视大宗、忽视小宗等不正确的认识，必须彻底加以纠正，以便进一步把推销土产运动普遍到每个乡村和每个城市去。
