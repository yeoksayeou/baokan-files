　　保卫好光景、反对美国武装日本
     芜湖县农民游行示威
    【新华社芜湖十五日电】三月十三日，芜湖县属超湾等三十二个村的一万七千多农民在芜湖市内游行示威。上述村庄的农民们在新近完成了土地改革。他们为了保卫好光景，表示坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本。
    这支游行队伍簇拥着毛主席、斯大林大元帅和金日成将军的画像，高举着千万把锄头、铁锹、镰刀，在这些农具上面贴着“控诉日寇暴行”、“反对美国单独对日媾和”等标语。在游行队伍中间，还有打着“修堤模范”奖旗的从长江堤圩赶来参加的民工们，掮着步枪、梭镖的民兵们，以及许多背着孩子的和老年的农妇们。他们不断地喊出“反对美国武装日本！”“展开农业爱国生产运动！”等口号。
    游行示威队伍接受了中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会皖南分会和芜湖市分会负责人的检阅，农民们并呈递了一百二十七封揭露美、日帝国主义暴行的控诉书和四十一封给中朝人民战士的慰问信。
