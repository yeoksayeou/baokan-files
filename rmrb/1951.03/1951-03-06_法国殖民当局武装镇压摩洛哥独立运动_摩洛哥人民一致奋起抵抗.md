Xinhua News Agency, March 5th, dispatch from Tass: The French colonial authorities in Morocco, with the support of American imperialists, recently launched a brutal armed offensive against the Moroccan people who are demanding national independence. This crime has aroused angry resistance from the entire Moroccan people. Recently, the French colonial authorities launched a search throughout Morocco for activists of all national independence movements. The first to be attacked was the Moroccan Communist Party. Ali Yata, General Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party, and Ferhat, a member of the Political Bureau, were arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for "failing to comply with instructions regarding departure from the country." The Istiqlal Party, a nationalist party representing the Moroccan national bourgeoisie, was also persecuted for opposing the inclusion of Morocco in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. The French Resident-General in Morocco, Juin, ordered the arrest of all members of the party's executive committee and threatened the Moroccan Sultan, who sympathized with the party, with the abolition of his throne, demanding that he publicly condemn the party's activities. The seven leaders of the party, who had previously been arrested by the French colonial authorities, were sentenced to prison terms. In the past three weeks, more than 35,000 patriots have been arrested throughout Morocco.

In this situation, the entire Moroccan people rose up in resistance, and the French colonial authorities even dispatched colonial troops equipped with tanks to attack the Moroccan people, and on the 2nd, they opened fire on civilians in the Kasbah-Tadla area, causing a large number of casualties. Now, the French colonial army has occupied the Moroccan capital, Rabat, imprisoned the Moroccan Sultan, and forced him to expel the Istiqlal Party supporters from the government. At the same time, the French army has surrounded the cities of Meknes and Fez, and dispatched the air force to bomb the peaceful residents of the two cities. Bloody conflicts are spreading throughout the country.

This bloody atrocity by the French executioners has aroused extreme indignation among the people of all Africa. Bouhafa, Secretary of the "North African Committee for Freedom," issued a statement to the press in New York, strongly protesting the French government's unwarranted infringement on the Moroccan people's measures, and declared: "The only goal of the Moroccan people is to get rid of the insatiable colonial rule."

　　法国殖民当局武装镇压摩洛哥独立运动
    摩洛哥人民一致奋起抵抗
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社消息：摩洛哥的法国殖民当局最近在美帝国主义者的支持下，对要求民族独立的摩洛哥人民发动了残酷的武装进攻。这种罪行已引起全摩洛哥人民的愤怒抵抗。最近以来，法国殖民当局在摩洛哥全境发动搜捕一切民族独立运动的积极分子。首先遭到进攻的是摩洛哥共产党。摩洛哥共产党总书记阿里雅塔和政治局委员费尔哈特在“不遵守关于出国的训令”的罪名下被捕，并被判二年徒刑。代表摩洛哥民族资产阶级的民族主义政党伊斯提克拉尔党，也因为反对把摩洛哥列入北大西洋侵略集团而横遭迫害。法国驻摩洛哥总督许温下令逮捕了该党全体执行委员，并以废除其王位要胁同情该党的摩洛哥苏丹，要他公开谴责该党的活动。而以前被法国殖民当局逮捕的该党领袖七人则被判处徒刑。三个星期以来，全摩洛哥被捕的爱国者竟达三万五千余人。
    在这种情形下，全摩洛哥人民奋起抵抗，而法国殖民当局竟出动了以坦克装备的殖民军进攻摩洛哥人民，并于二日在加斯巴——塔德拉地区向平民开火，造成大批伤亡。现在，法国殖民军已占领摩洛哥首府拉巴特城，囚禁摩洛哥苏丹，胁迫他把支持伊斯提克拉尔党的分子逐出了政府。同时，法军又已包围麦克尼斯与非斯两城，出动空军轰炸两城和平居民。流血冲突正在全境各地扩展中。
    法国刽子手这种血腥暴行已引起全非洲人民的极度愤慨。“北非争取自由委员会”书记包哈法在纽约向报界发表声明，严重抗议法国政府无端侵害摩洛哥人民的措施，并宣称：“摩洛哥人民的唯一目标，乃是摆脱贪得无厌的殖民主义统治。”
