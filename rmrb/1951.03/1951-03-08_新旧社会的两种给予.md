　　Two Kinds of Giving in the Old and New Societies
　　Wu Suqiu
　　I was born into a tailor's family in the coastal area of Shandong Province. Unfortunately, I lost my father when I was two years old. After that, I followed my mother, living a life of hardship, wandering and drifting. At the age of eight, I entered elementary school in Dalian. However, in the old society, the golden age of a person - their student years - was deprived from the children of poor families. At the age of eleven, I left school and wandered with my mother to Beijing. Because I loved drama, and more importantly, for the sake of our livelihood, my mother and I, I threw myself into a drama school (opera school) that used to specialize in whipping as a form of education. At that time, in my naive heart, I had only one thought: no matter how much hardship I endured, as long as I could learn the opera well, support my mother, and make our lives a little more comfortable, that would be enough. From the age of twelve, I began performing on stage, starting my stage life. In 1937, when I was sixteen, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out. We, the people living in this ancient cultural city, from then on lived a miserable and painful life under the iron heel and terror of Japanese imperialism. At that time, the artists in the opera world, especially the female artists, suffered countless oppressions and insults.

　　Japanese, puppet, military police, secret agents, and lackeys arbitrarily occupied seats to watch the opera, and flirted with us wantonly backstage. If they were not treated with slight care, we would be subjected to scolding and beatings. When those petty officials, who were acting like tigers, were feasting and drinking, they would order the then-existing Pear Garden Guild to summon us to pour wine, accompany them in drinking, sing, and dance. Any slight negligence would result in the extremely barbaric and brutal insults and beatings from that group of well-fed beasts in human clothing.

　　I remember clearly that at that time, some sisters were broken into their homes in the middle of the night by the Japanese puppet lackeys, grabbing their hair, grabbing their ears, and using pistols to force them to satisfy their intentions.

　　Some sisters were brought to the Japanese military police on trumped-up charges, subjected to torture and imprisonment. Although our sisters in the opera world suffered such humiliation and oppression at that time, we still had to put on a smiling face on the surface, even if tears flowed into our stomachs.

　　When we were to perform in other places, along the way, the Japanese puppet troops and police used various absolutely malicious methods to insult us, forcing us to take off our shoes and socks in public under the guise of "inspection", kicking our feet and punching us, which was a common occurrence. At that time, as soon as we heard the words "private performance," "visiting guests," "inspection," and "station," we would be frightened.

　　Therefore, from that period onwards, some of our sisters in the opera world were forced to become concubines; some, with heavy hearts, got married or changed careers; and some accumulated illness and died silently.

　　Because of that demonic society at that time, and some of the encounters and sufferings I heard and witnessed, I resolutely left my beloved and relied-upon stage life, married a student, and left Beijing, despite all the obstacles and slanders from evil forces. We lived a family life in Qingdao, passively waiting for the arrival of a bright future.

　　The Japanese invaders surrendered! Like all the good people in the country, I greeted this day with the most excited and joyful tears. I mistakenly regarded Chiang Kai-shek, who sold out the country and betrayed the people, as China's "great savior." I thought that from then on, I would no longer be subjected to any bullying or harm, and everyone could live freely and happily, without having to worry and be uneasy all day long as before.

　　Due to the performances of many old predecessors who had already disappeared from the stage, I once planned to regroup and return to the stage. However, the reality was completely the opposite of the beautiful scene I had imagined. The Kuomintang reactionaries, at the instigation and with the help of American imperialism, stole the fruits of victory that the broad masses of people had exchanged with their blood and flesh. Those swaggering officials and generals flew to the occupied areas in batches, looting, confiscating, extorting, and blackmailing. Prices jumped several times a day, and exorbitant taxes increased month by month. They viciously rode on the heads of the broad masses of working people to satisfy their extravagant, drunken, singing, and dancing lives. They were no different from the wolfish group during the Japanese puppet occupation in their treatment of artists in the opera world. Artists were still despised and humiliated by society. "Private performance," "visiting guests," "inspection"... although outwardly more dignified, their essence was still to build their joy on our suffering. Although I loved drama, and although I was living a hard life, my belief in performing was once again shattered. I despairingly continued to be a housewife buried in trivial housework.

　　I used to, and often did, think: We actors and actresses live by our art and labor, why are we looked down upon? What is there that can be said to be a "base profession"? Even when I had been away from the stage for five or six years, I was once watching a movie at the China Theater in Qingdao, and was insulted to my face by the person in charge of the theater (a Kuomintang reactionary agent of the Central Statistics Bureau) who said: "Humph! A stinking opera singer!" Just because he checked the wrong ticket and I questioned him, I would be insulted like this. Therefore, I deeply felt that being an artist would never be able to stand up. For this, my sorrow and despair reached the extreme.

　　On June 2, 1949, Qingdao, under the evil rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, was liberated victoriously by the heroic People's Liberation Army, following Shanghai. Those Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialists, and all feudal evil forces who specialized in bullying us, oppressing us, and榨取 us, were all eradicated and driven out of mainland China with the liberation of the broad masses of people. All the people who lived by their labor, but had been insulted and harmed, stood up.

　　However, in the early days of Qingdao's liberation, I still had some confused ideas in my mind. I welcomed the People's Government, but I was always a little apprehensive. Although the People's Liberation Army and all cadres of government agencies were so serious, kind, polite, and disciplined in their dealings with people, there was nothing that could make me apprehensive, but I always thought in my mind: "A new emperor has new subjects," "The winner is king and the loser is a thief," it's just the same old soup in a new bottle, there will never be a fair and reasonable society that truly cares about the common people, nor will there be a government that treats us artists equally. However, the reality was exactly the opposite of what I had imagined. China, which had just been liberated from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, was scarred all over; but the People's Government still took care of many aspects in a planned way despite all kinds of difficulties. The love and encouragement for the opera world and the improvement of the social and political status of artists can be said to be an epoch-making transformation. Even an ordinary actress like me, a person who has made no contribution to the motherland and the people, would be elected by the people of Qingdao to participate in the People's Representative Conference. This made me too moved and ashamed.

　　Looking back on my past performances, it was only for personal love of drama and to maintain a living. Leaving the stage for seven years was only out of dissatisfaction with the old society and a passive resistance to evil forces, without actively participating in the actual revolutionary struggle. Although there were objective environmental restrictions at that time, I still feel very ashamed when I examine myself.

　　The sharp contrast between the past and the present, as well as what I have personally experienced, have deeply educated me. It has made me truly realize that "Only the Communist Party can have a new China," and only Chairman Mao can lead us to stand up and lead us to move forward on the road to light and happiness. I must work hard to study in the future, improve my political and artistic level, and fight for the people's drama cause for the rest of my life!

　　新旧社会的两种给予
    吴素秋
    我诞生在山东省沿海一带的一个裁缝家庭中。不幸在我两岁的时候，就失去了父亲。此后便跟随着母亲过着困苦艰难、飘泊流浪的生活。八岁那年，在大连进入小学。但是，在旧社会里，一个人的黄金时代——学生时代，对于穷人家的子女来说，是被剥夺了的。在十一岁那年，我离开了学校，又随母亲流浪到北京。因为我性嗜戏剧，更为了我们母女二人的生活，所以我便投身在过去专以鞭笞为教刑的戏曲学校（科班）里。那时候，在我幼稚的心灵上只有一个念头，就是任凭吃多少苦、受多少罪，只要能把戏学好，能够养活我母亲，能够使我们母女的生活较为安适些就够了。从十二岁登台演唱，开始了我的舞台生活。在我十六岁（一九三七年）那年，抗日战争爆发了。我们生活在这文化古城的人民，从此便在日本帝国主义者的铁蹄下和恐怖的气氛中，过着凄惨悲痛的日子。那时候，戏曲界的艺人们，尤其是女艺人，所受的压迫与侮辱，真是屈指难数的。
    日、伪的军、警、特务和走狗们，任意地占坐看戏，恣情地到后台对我们调笑。对他们稍有不周，就会遭到一顿辱骂和殴打。那些狐假虎威的大小官员在欢宴酒酣的时候，更随时命令那时的梨园公会把我们召集去敬酒陪酒，作歌作舞。稍有疏忽，便会受到那群酒足饭饱的衣冠禽兽的极野蛮、最残暴的侮辱和殴打。
    我清清楚楚地记得，在那时候，有的姐妹曾在半夜三更被日伪的走狗们闯进屋去，揪着头发，抓着耳朵，用手枪威逼着来满足他们的企图。
    有的姐妹们则被加以莫须有的罪名，给带到日本宪兵队去，受非刑拷打与监禁。我们戏曲界的姐妹在那时虽然受尽如此的侮辱与压迫，但是表面上仍得像做戏一样的笑脸逢迎，那怕是眼泪往肚子里流。
    当我们要到外地去演唱时，沿途被日伪军、警用各种绝对恶意的手段来侮辱我们，假借“检查”的名义，逼迫着我们当众脱鞋，扒袜，挨脚踢，受拳打，那真是司空见惯的事。那时，我们一听到：“堂会”、“拜客”、“检查”、“车站”这些字眼，就会不由己地心惊胆寒起来。
    因此，我们戏曲界的姐妹们，从那个时期起，有的被逼着给人做了妾；有的怀着悲痛的心情，嫁了人或转了业；有的就积郁成病，无声无臭地死去了。
    由于当时那种魔鬼似的社会，和我耳闻目睹、亲身所受的一些遭遇与痛苦，使我不顾一切恶势力的阻难与中伤，毅然地脱离了我心爱的、赖以生存的舞台生活，嫁了一个学生，离开了北京。我们在青岛过着家庭生活，消极地盼望着光明日子的到来。
    日寇投降了！我和全国所有善良的人民一样，以最兴奋最欢欣的眼泪，迎接了这一天。我错误地把出卖祖国、背叛人民的蒋介石看做了中国的“大救星”。心想从此可以不再受任何欺侮与损害了，每个人都可以自由幸福地生活着，用不着再像从前一样提心吊胆，惶惶不可终日了。
    由于许多早已敛迹舞台的老前辈们的纷纷演出，使我一度也曾经计划着重整旗鼓，回到舞台上去。但是事实与我所想像的美丽景象完全相反。国民党反动派在美帝国主义怂恿和帮助下，盗窃了广大人民以血肉换来的胜利果实。那些耀武扬威的官员、将军，一批批地飞到沦陷区来，大肆抢收、劫收、勒索、讹诈，物价一日数跳，苛捐杂税月月增加。他们穷凶极恶地骑在广大劳苦人民的头上，来满足他们的花天酒地、歌舞享乐的生活。他们对于戏曲界的艺人，是和日伪侵占时期的那批狐狼之群，没有什么区别的。艺人仍是被社会所不齿而受侮辱。“堂会”、“拜客”、“检查”……外表上虽然较之冠冕堂皇些，但骨子里依然是把他们的欢乐建筑在我们的痛苦上。虽然我爱好戏剧，虽然我在过着清苦的生活，但是我演出的信念再次地被粉碎了。我绝望地依然继续作一个埋头于繁琐家务中的家庭妇女。
    我曾经，而且常常这样想：我们演戏的人，凭着自己的艺术和劳动来生活，为什么会被人看不起呢？有什么地方可以让人说是“贱业”呢？甚至于在我脱离舞台已经五、六年的时候，有一次在青岛中国剧院看电影，竟会被该院负责人（国民党反动派中统局的特务）当面侮辱我说：“哼！一个臭唱戏的！”仅仅为了他查错了票，我质问他一声，都会得到这种侮辱。因此我深深觉得作一个艺人是永远不会翻身的。为此我悲哀和绝望达于极顶。
    一九四九年六月二日，在蒋介石匪帮万恶统治下的青岛，继上海之后也被英勇的人民解放军胜利解放了。那些专门欺侮我们、压迫我们、榨取我们的国民党反动派、帝国主义者和一切封建恶势力，都随着广大人民的解放，被铲除，被驱逐出中国大陆了。一切凭劳力而生活、但是曾被侮辱与损害的人民翻身了。
    不过我在青岛解放初期，思想上还存着若干混乱意识。人民政府，我是欢迎的，但总有些惶惑。虽然人民解放军和一切政府机关的干部们，都是那样认真、和蔼、有礼貌、有纪律地待人接物，根本没有可以让我惶惑的地方，但是思想上总认为：“一朝天子一朝臣”，“胜者王侯败者贼”，换汤不换药，总是老一套，不会有真正为老百姓着想的一个公平合理的社会，也不会有平等看待我们艺人的一个政府。然而事实恰与我所想像的相反。一个刚从半殖民地、半封建社会解放出来的中国，是满目疮痍的；但是人民政府在百般困难中，依然是有计划地照顾了多方面。对于戏曲界的爱护与鼓励以及艺人的社会政治地位的提高，真可以说是划时代的一个大转变。连我这样一个普通的演员，一个对祖国对人民毫无贡献的人，竟也会被青岛市的人民选出参加人民代表会议。这使我太感动和惭愧了。
    回想过去的出演，仅仅是为了个人爱好戏剧及维持生活。脱离舞台七年，也不过是为了对旧社会的不满，对恶势力的一种消极抵抗，而没有更积极地参加实际的革命斗争。虽然彼时有其客观环境的限制，但是自己检讨起来，总是感到万分惭愧的。
    过去和现在的鲜明对比，以及自己亲身所体验的，都深刻地教育了我。使我真正认识到：“唯有共产党，才有新中国”，也唯有毛主席才能领导我们翻了身，领导我们向光明幸福的道路前进。我今后一定要努力学习，提高自己的政治水平与艺术水平，为人民的戏剧事业奋斗终身！
