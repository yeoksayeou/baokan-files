Reader's Letter

    To the Editor of the Min Nian, Xinjin County, Sichuan:
    I am writing to report on the past and present situation of the construction of Min Nian (Nian are dams built across rivers to block and store water – Editor's note) in Xinjin County, Sichuan.
    There are a total of twenty-nine Min Nian in Xinjin County, Sichuan, which can irrigate more than 70% of the county's cultivated land. However, before liberation, the Min Nian were all under the feudal control of the landlords. When the Min Nian were built, the landlords not only refused to pay for the construction, but also embezzled and misappropriated funds. When using water, they also had a set of feudal water regulations to ensure the interests of the landlords.
    After liberation, the situation has changed. In July last year, the county held a water conservancy conference to change the construction and water use system of the Min Nian. Now the county's water conservancy committee uniformly manages the Min Nian project plans and construction funds, so as to carry out construction work in a planned and unified manner throughout the county. The amount of earthwork for Nian construction in 1950 increased by 5.31 times compared with 1949; however, the payment of labor and materials was 49.9% less than in 1949, and the labor cost was also 20% less than in 1949.
    In the past, the workers who built the Nian generally had the habit of "half a day of Nian" (that is, only working half a day a day when building the Nian). Now, because these Min Nian have been or will be owned by the peasants themselves, the peasants know that if the Nian are built well, they can irrigate more, so they have changed their attitude towards labor. In the past, each worker dug 0.3 cubic meters of earth per day, but now it has increased to 0.7 cubic meters.
    In the past, because of the feudal control of the landlords, there were often disputes between upstream and downstream, and left and right banks when using water. Now this situation has also changed. The principles of "taking into account both upstream and downstream," "paying equal attention to both left and right banks," "subordinating partial interests to overall interests," and "taking care of small interests with large interests" decided at the Sichuan West Water Conservancy Conference have been gradually realized. The county has mediated 13 water distribution disputes, including cases that have been entangled for more than 50 years and could not be resolved. For example, in the case of Yu Zaiqiao's bridge foundation at the inlet of Tang Nian being higher than the bottom of the canal, which hindered the flow of water, lawsuits have been filed since the Qing Dynasty, but it has not been resolved. Now, after the mediation and persuasion of the people's government, the peasants have realized the importance of internal unity and production, and the disputes that could not be resolved for many years have been smoothly resolved.

### 四川新津县的民埝

    四川新津县的民埝编辑同志：
    我向你报告四川新津县修建民埝（埝，就是横筑在河中用以堵蓄河水的一种坝——编者）的今昔情况。
    四川新津县一共有二十九道民埝，能灌溉全县百分之七十以上的耕地。但是，在解放以前，民埝都是在地主的封建把持之下。修筑民埝时，地主们不仅不出修筑费，还要贪污中饱；用水时，更有一套封建的水规，以保证地主们的利益。
    解放后，情况已经改变了。去年七月间，全县开了一个水利会议，改变了民埝的修建与用水制度。现在全县的民埝工程计划和修建经费都由县水利委员会统一掌握，以便在全县范围内有计划地统一地进行修建工作。一九五零年修埝土方比一九四九年增加了五点三一倍；但是工料支付却比一九四九年节省了百分之四十九点九，人工也比一九四九年节省了百分之二十。
    过去修埝的工人普遍有着“埝半天”的习惯（就是修埝时每天只工作半天），现在因为这些民埝已经或将要归于农民自己所有，农民们知道修好了埝，自己能多灌溉，因此就改变了劳动态度，过去每工每天挖土零点三市方，现在已增到零点七市方。
    过去因为地主的封建把持，在用水时，上下游、左右岸常起争执。现在这种情况也转变了，川西水利会议上决定的“上下游兼顾”、“左右岸并重”、“局部利益服从整体利益”、“大利益照顾小利益”等原则已经逐渐实现。全县调处了分水纠纷十三件，其中有五十多年来一直纠缠着得不到解决的案子。如在汤埝进水口的喻在桥的桥基高出渠底，阻碍水流一案，从清朝时代就打官司，一直不能解决；现在经过人民政府的调解说服，农民们认识到了自己内部团结生产的重要，多年不能解决的纠纷便顺利地解决了。
