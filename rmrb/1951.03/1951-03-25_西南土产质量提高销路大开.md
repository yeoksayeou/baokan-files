Southwest Native Products Quality Improvement Leads to Increased Sales
    Many native products in the Southwest region have opened up sales channels both domestically and internationally. According to statistics from the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, the total export value of 27 major native products last year reached 710 billion yuan. Among the exported native products, there were 30,000 dan of pig bristles, 40,000 tons of tung oil, 45,000 dan of green hemp, and 65,000 dan of gallnuts, all exceeding the export volume during the Anti-Japanese War. In January and February of this year, foreign sales of native products have reached 2.31 million jin. Among them, many are native products that have never been sold before. For example, Sichuan's important medicinal material, Coptis chinensis, has shipped 10,000 jin to Shanghai in January and February, and galangal has shipped 150,000 jin to Wuhan. Other native products such as white ginger, lacquer, and wax have opened up sales channels because they can be transported to Eastern European New Democratic countries.
    The Southwest region's past shortcomings of not paying enough attention to domestic sales of native products have recently begun to improve. For example, the native tobacco of Western Sichuan was originally a domestic sales product, but it once experienced sluggish sales due to insufficient attention. As a result of improving this shortcoming, the native tobacco of Western Sichuan shipped to Southern Sichuan reached 3,000 dan in January and February this year. The experience of promoting native products in the Southwest region also proves that actively promoting to other regions is a good way to open up sales channels for native products. For example, the rattan canes produced in Northern Sichuan have never had sales channels in other regions, but due to active promotion, 200,000 orders have recently been received from the North China region. Yunnan's Xuanwei ham, due to active promotion to the Guangzhou market, has sold out all 4,800 pounds shipped in January, and the second batch of 9,600 pounds will be shipped.
    Paying attention to improving quality, improving packaging, and standardizing specifications is of great help in opening up sales channels for native products. For example, the Fuling area of ​​Eastern Sichuan established an export review committee for pickled mustard tuber, stipulating that pickled mustard tuber that does not meet the export standards is not allowed to be exported, which has improved the reputation of pickled mustard tuber in other regions and made sales increasingly smooth. Therefore, the output of pickled mustard tuber in this area this year will increase by two times compared with last year. The native paper produced in Xiyang, Eastern Sichuan, used to affect sales due to inconsistent specifications. Now, because the native product company has specified the specifications, the products of various paper mills have gradually become uniform, and sales have recovered. Now the number of paper mills in the area has recovered from 300 to more than 700. After improving the packaging of native tobacco in Western Sichuan, the weight is reduced, thus saving about one-sixth of the freight.
    The problem of inconvenient transportation encountered in the transportation and sale of native products in the Southwest region has recently been gradually resolved with the assistance of relevant departments. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Southwest Region, in order to encourage the transportation and sale of native products, stipulated that from March 15, the "return empty fee" in highway transportation will be completely abolished, and the price of highway freight will also be reduced. From February, the Chongqing Shipping Bureau reduced the freight of 33 kinds of native products by 15% to 50%.

### 西南土产质量提高销路大开

　　西南土产质量提高销路大开
    西南区许多土产品已打开了国内外的销路。据西南军政委员会贸易部统计，去年二十七种主要土产品的输出总值达七千一百亿元。在输出的土产中，有猪鬃三万担，桐油四万吨，青麻四万五千担，五棓子六万五千担，都超过了抗战时期的输出量。今年一、二两月，外销土产已达二百三十一万斤。其中不少是历来没有销路的土产，如四川重要药材黄连，一、二两月已运销上海一万斤，黄姜运销武汉十五万斤，其他如白姜、漆、蜡等土产都因为能运往东欧新民主主义国家而打开了销路。
    西南区过去对土产在本区内销注意不够的缺点，最近已开始得到改进。如川西的土烟原为内销土产，但曾因注意不够而滞销。由于改进了这个缺点，川西土烟今年一、二月份运销川南的即达三千担。西南区推销土产的经验也证明，主动向外区推销是打开土产销路的好办法。如川北所产的藤杖，一向在外区没有销路，但由于主动推销，最近已接到华北区的二十万根订货。云南的宣威火腿，由于主动向广州市场推销，一月份运去的四千八百磅已全部销完，第二批将运去九千六百磅。
    注意提高质量，改善包装与划一规格，对打开土产销路帮助很大。如川东涪陵成立了榨菜出口审核委员会，规定凡不合出口标准的榨菜一律不准出口，使榨菜在外区信誉提高，销路日畅。因此该地今年所产榨菜将较去年增加两倍。川东西阳所产土纸，过去由于规格不一，影响了销路，现因土产公司规定了规格，各纸坊出品已渐渐划一，销路恢复，现该地纸坊已由三百家恢复到七百多家。川西土烟经改善包装后，重量减轻，因而节省运费六分之一左右。
    西南区在运销土产中遇到的交通运输不便的问题，最近在各有关部门的协助下，已逐步得到解决。西南区财政经济委员会为了鼓励运销土产，规定自三月十五日起，公路运输中的“回空费”全部取消，同时并减低了公路货运的价格。重庆航务局从二月份起将三十三种土产的运费减低了百分之十五至五十。
