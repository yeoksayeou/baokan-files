Conscientiously Study the Trade Union Law

According to letters from readers in various regions, violations of the Trade Union Law continue to occur in many factories and mines. Although the Trade Union Law has been promulgated for nine months, it has not yet had the practical effect it should have in many factories and mines. This is a serious problem that deserves attention.

After the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, major and medium-sized cities organized cadres from trade unions and labor bureaus to study it. It was also disseminated among workers in public and private enterprises. Places that did well even combined it with practical work, carried out inspections, and researched specific implementation measures, which increased the prestige of the trade union, improved workers' production enthusiasm, and strengthened the relationship between the Party, government, and trade union. However, in most areas, the Trade Union Law was only treated as a general document for study. Some administrative staff members believed that "implementing the Trade Union Law is the trade union's business." They did not truly regard the Trade Union Law as a most powerful weapon to further rely on the workers, protect the workers' due rights and interests, and improve the enthusiasm for production. At the same time, some trade union organizations themselves did not proactively grasp the basic spirit of the Trade Union Law to carry out work and fight for its realization.

In order to fully realize the Trade Union Law, the central link at present is to organize study. Every enterprise and trade union worker should be familiar with the Trade Union Law. The basic method of study should be to combine the articles with a line-by-line inspection of the work and to propose methods for improving work based on the Trade Union Law. Only through conscientious study, and establishing the viewpoint of relying on the working class in study and reflection, is it possible to avoid the various errors published on today's reader's letter page of this newspaper.

### 认真学习工会法

　　认真学习工会法
    据各地读者来信反映，违反工会法的现象在许多厂矿仍继续不断地发生，虽然工会法颁布至今已有九个月，但在不少厂矿，工会法仍然没有发生应有的实际效力，这是一个值得注意的严重问题。
    工会法颁布后，各大、中城市均曾组织了工会和劳动局干部学习，在公私营企业及工人群众中也曾进行过传达，作得好的地方，更结合实际进行检查工作，研究出具体执行办法，使工会威信增高，工人生产情绪提高，党、政、工关系更加密切。但在大部地区却只把工会法当作了一般文件来学习，若干行政工作人员认为：“执行工会法是工会的事”。没有把工会法真正作为进一步依靠工人，保障工人应有权益，提高生产积极性的一个最有力的武器。同时，若干工会组织本身也没有主动地掌握工会法的基本精神进行工作并为其实现而斗争。
    为了全部实现工会法，目前中心的一环，是要组织学习。每一个企业和工会工作人员均应熟读工会法。学习的方法基本上应是结合条文逐条检查工作，根据工会法提出改进工作的办法。只有经过认真学习，并在学习和反省中树立起依靠工人阶级的观点，才有可能避免像今天本报读者来信专页上所发表的各种错误。
