How did the Party Committee, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League of a certain factory in Fushun coordinate to improve production?
　　In 1950, a certain factory in Fushun victoriously overfulfilled the state's production plan. The main responsible cadres of the factory's Chinese Communist Party Committee, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League respected each other and coordinated their efforts, working around production from their different positions. This was one of the fundamental reasons for the factory’s success in improving production and achieving such results.
　　The factory director had a relatively clear understanding of the idea of relying on the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League to improve production. Therefore, he could often proactively seek the leadership of the Party and the cooperation of the Trade Union and Youth League. For example, before the factory's production plan was announced, the director would first proactively convene the factory management committee or the standing committee to discuss and study it. Then, the Trade Union would lead the Trade Union committees of various workshops, the production and wage committees, and the group meetings (Trade Union groups were organized according to administrative groups) to discuss and study how to ensure the completion of the production plan. The administration promptly provided the Party Committee and the Trade Union (the Youth League shared a copy with the Party Committee) with production quick reports, attendance reports, and production summaries. The daily production coordination meetings of each workshop included the responsible cadres of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League, so that the Party, administration, and Youth League could promptly understand the problems in production. The administration also promptly provided the responsible cadres of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League with major technical problems that occurred in production, so that they could mobilize the workers to use their brains, find solutions, and overcome difficulties. This solved a series of major technical problems. The factory director was able to humbly accept the opinions of the responsible comrades of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League. For example, in March of last year, the Trade Union cadres, based on the experience of some factories in Dalian in implementing collective contracts, proactively suggested to the administration that they try out collective contracts. The director quickly accepted this suggestion and worked with the Trade Union to jointly study and sign factory-wide collective contracts in the second and third quarters, and earnestly implemented the various conditions stipulated in the contracts. For example, after the collective contracts were signed last year, the administration was responsible for solving 3,773 material supply problems, 1,751 tool and equipment problems, and many other welfare problems. In order to establish the legal concept of contracts and establish the prestige of the Trade Union, the director criticized the head of the Capital Construction Section, who had failed to earnestly implement the contract, at the general meeting of all employees. In other matters, such as personnel appointments, rewards and punishments, and the promotion of section-level or higher cadres, the director proactively sought the consent of the Party and Trade Union leaders.
　　The Party Committee truly guaranteed and supervised the completion of production. First, it implemented the Party's policy of uniting technical personnel and staff. In May of last year, the factory's Party Committee, based on the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC on uniting technical personnel and staff, led the Trade Union in conducting education among all employees, and continuously held forums for technical personnel in May and June to make them understand that technical personnel are part of the working class. In terms of living conditions, it also suggested that the administration provide appropriate care (such as repairing dormitories). Through this education and necessary care, the technical personnel moved closer to the Party ideologically, and thus fully brought into play the enthusiasm of the technical personnel, combining the technical personnel with the practical experience of the workers, and systematically solving some major technical problems, ensuring the completion and exceeding of the state plan. Second, the Party paid attention to building Party work in production. Through education, it systematically absorbed a group of technically skilled workers with class consciousness into the Party. Because the Party members mastered technology (out of 207 Party members in the factory, 146 were technical workers and 25 were technical personnel, accounting for 82.6 percent of all Party members), and had been tested by actual work, 36 cadres above the rank of team leader were promoted from among the workers, including 4 section chiefs, 10 directors, and 6 heads of departments. This was the backbone of the Party's guarantee and supervision of production. The factory Party Committee and the workshop branches, at regular Party cadre meetings (including the committee) and Party member meetings, and when giving Party lessons to Party members, in addition to conducting various types of education, also arranged and called on Party members to play an exemplary role in production, technical improvement, and overcoming various difficulties. Through the above work, most Party members became active elements in production, and a few Party members made great contributions to technical improvement. In the 1950 factory-wide election of 64 model workers, Party members accounted for 22, accounting for 36 percent of all model workers.
　　After the Trade Union signed a collective contract with the administration, the Trade Union cadres clarified their thinking on improving production. On the one hand, the Trade Union mobilized all employees to seriously discuss the production plan and implement the plan among the workers. On the other hand, after the production tasks were issued, it immediately delved into the production process to study the specific problems in production. Organizationally, it firmly grasped the two organizations of the Production and Wage Committee and the Rationalization Proposal Committee, and adopted various forms and methods to lead technical personnel and workers to solve difficult problems in production. Secondly, with the assistance of the administration, the Trade Union timely organized the contact contracts of relevant units, effectively solving the problems of lack of coordination between workshops and departments, workshops and workshops, and various units within workshops, which hindered production. Thirdly, under the leadership of the Party and with the assistance of the administration, the Trade Union frequently organized production competitions, and in the competitions, cultivated typical examples, summarized experiences, and promoted them according to the different conditions of the workshops, and carried out propaganda and mobilization work in various forms. As a result, the completion of the state production plan was guaranteed and the contract was fulfilled. Because the Trade Union faced production and achieved results, the administration more actively relied on the Trade Union, thus strengthening the unity between the administration and the Trade Union.
　　Under the general call of the Youth League Committee, the Youth League led Youth League members to help young workers improve their skills, implement technical operating procedures, overcome difficulties, and improve technology, achieving considerable results. For example, Feng Changkuan, a Youth League member in a certain workshop, united with veteran worker Li Baoheng to jointly transform the original clumsy lathe in the workshop into an automatic lathe, increasing production efficiency by five times. The Youth League group in the workshop proposed seven rationalization proposals in four months, all of which were adopted.
　　The main cadres of the Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League in the factory are basically united, and thus production has achieved great results. However, there are still some problems. The most serious is that the responsible cadres of the administration, Trade Union, and Youth League do not have a clear understanding of the idea of relying on the "working class" to improve production. This is mainly manifested in the fact that the factory management committee is perfunctory. No meetings have been held since September of last year, and the employee representative meeting has not been held once since October of last year. The responsible comrades of the administration believe that the members generated from the workers can only raise individual welfare issues at the meeting, and cannot raise production issues. Therefore, the erroneous idea that the coordination meeting of the responsible cadres of the Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League can replace the factory management committee has been generated. Even the Trade Union cadres threw away the list of members of the re-elected factory management committee. To this day, none of the responsible cadres of the Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League know how many management committee members there are among the workers, and how many representatives there are among the employees, thus limiting the further improvement of employee morale.
　　Editor's note: The Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League are moving in unison towards production, which is actually moving towards the working class and relying on the working class to improve production. The Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League of a certain factory in Fushun have indeed achieved many results by moving in unison towards production, which is correct. In the future, we should further grasp the key issue of facing the working class and relying on the working class, correct past shortcomings, and ensure that production work is improving with each passing day.

　　抚顺某工厂党行政工会青年团是如何协同一致搞好生产的？
    抚顺某工厂一九五○年胜利地超额完成了国家的生产计划。该厂中国共产党党委、行政、工会、青年团主要负责干部相互尊重，协同一致，从各个不同的工作岗位上围绕生产进行工作，是搞好生产，获得这种成绩的基本原因之一。
    该厂厂长依靠党、工会、青年团搞好生产的思想比较明确，故能经常主动地取得党的领导与工会、青年团的配合。如工厂生产计划未公布之前，厂长首先主动地召开工厂管理委员会或常务委员会，进行讨论研究，然后由工会领导各车间工会委员会、生产工资委员会以及小组会（工会小组根据行政小组编组）讨论研究如何保证生产计划的完成。行政上按时将生产速报表、出勤日报、生产总结等交给党委与工会（青年团与党委共一份）。各车间每天的生产碰头会，都吸收车间党、工会、青年团负责干部参加，这样，可使党、行政、青年团及时了解生产中的问题。生产中发生的重大技术问题，行政也及时提供给党、工会、青年团负责干部，使他们便于发动工人群众动脑筋，想办法，克服困难，这样就解决了一系列的重大技术问题。该厂厂长能虚心接受党、工会、青年团负责同志提的意见，如去年三月份，工会干部根据大连某些工厂实行集体合同的经验，主动向行政提出试行集体合同，厂长很快地接受了这一建议，并协同工会共同研究，在二三季度签订了全厂集体合同，并认真执行了合同中所规定的各种条件。如去年签订集体合同后，行政负责解决材料供应方面的问题三、七七三件，工具设备方面的问题一、七五一件，以及其他许多福利问题。为了树立合同的法律观念，建立工会的威信，厂长在全体职工大会上，对于未认真执行合同的基本建设科长进行了批评。其他如人事任用、奖惩、提拔股长以上干部等，都主动地争取党与工会领导干部的同意。
    党委真正作到了保证与监督生产的完成。首先贯彻了党的团结技术人员与职员的政策，去年五月，该厂党委根据中共东北局关于团结技术人员与职员的指示，领导工会在全体职工中进行了教育，并在五六月份不断地召开技术人员座谈会，使其了解技术人员是工人阶级一部分的道理，在生活上并建议行政给予适当照顾（如修理宿舍）。通过这种教育与必要的照顾，技术人员便从思想上更进一步靠近了党，因而充分发挥了技术人员的积极性，使技术人员与工人的实际经验结合起来，有系统地解决了一些重大的技术问题，保证了国家计划的完成与超过。其次，党在生产中注意了建设党的工作，经过教育，有计划地吸收了一批有阶级觉悟的技术工人入党。由于党员掌握了技术（全厂党员二百零七人，其中技术工人一百四十六人，技术人员二十五人，共占全体党员的百分之八二·六），经过了实际工作考验，自工人当中提拔了班长以上干部三十六人，其中科长四人、主任十人、股长六人，这是党保证监督生产的骨干。工厂党委与车间支部在定期的党内干部会议（委员会在内）与党员大会上，以及给党员上党课时，除进行各种教育外，并布置号召党员在生产上、技术改进上，以及克服各种困难上起模范带头作用。经过上述工作，大多数党员成为生产中的积极分子，其中少数党员在技术改进上有极大的贡献。一九五○年全厂选举模范六十四人，党员即占二十二人，占全厂模范百分之三十六。
    工会与行政签订集体合同后，工会干部搞好生产的思想明确了。工会一方面发动全体职工认真讨论了生产计划，把计划贯彻到工人群众中去；一方面在生产任务下达后，立即深入生产过程，研究生产中的具体问题。在组织上抓紧了生产工资委员会与合理化建议委员会这两个组织，采用各种形式与各种办法，领导技术人员与工人解决生产中困难问题。其次工会在行政协助下，及时组织了有关单位的联系合同，有效地解决了车间与科室、车间与车间及车间内部各单位互不协调，以致妨碍生产的问题。再次工会在党的领导与行政的协助下，经常组织生产竞赛，在竞赛中根据车间不同的情况，培养典型，总结经验，加以推广，并以各种形式进行宣传鼓动工作。结果保证了国家生产计划的完成，履行了合同。由于工会面向了生产取得了成绩，使行政更主动的依靠工会，因而加强了行政与工会的团结。
    青年团在团委的一般号召下，领导团员帮助青年工人提高技术，贯彻技术操作规程，克服困难，改进技术，获得相当成绩，如某车间团员冯常宽团结老工友李保恒，共同将车间原有笨床子改为自动床子，生产效率提高五倍。该车间青年团的小组四个月提出七件合理化建议，都被采用了。
    该厂党、行政、工会、青年团主要干部基本上是团结的，因而生产上取得了很大成绩，但是，仍然存在一些问题，最严重的是行政、工会、青年团负责干部依靠“工人阶级”搞好生产的思想均不明确。主要表现在工厂管理委员会流于形式，去年九月以后至今不召开会议，职工代表会去年十月后也未开过一次。行政负责同志认为工人中产生的委员在会议上只能提个别福利问题，不能提出生产问题，因而便产生了党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部的碰头会可以代替工厂管理委员会的错误思想，甚至工会干部把改选的工厂管理委员会委员名单丢掉，至今党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部谁也搞不清工人中有几个管理委员会委员，职工中有多少代表，因之限制了职工情绪的进一步提高。
    编者按：党、行政、工会、青年团步调一致地面向生产，实际上就是面向工人阶级，依靠工人阶级搞好生产。抚顺某工厂党、行政、工会、青年团步调一致面向生产，的确获得了不少的成绩，这是对的，今后应更进一步抓住面向工人阶级、依靠工人阶级这个关键问题，纠正过去缺点，保证生产工作日新月异。
