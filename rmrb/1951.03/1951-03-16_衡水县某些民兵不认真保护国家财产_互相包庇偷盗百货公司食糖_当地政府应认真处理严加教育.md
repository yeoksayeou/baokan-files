Certain militiamen in Hengshui County are not serious about protecting state property.
Mutually shielding theft of sugar from the department store.
Local government should seriously handle this and strictly educate them.

Comrade Editor:

In early January, the Hengshui Department Store in Hebei Province took over a large batch of sugar allocated by the China General Merchandise Company (held in trust). Due to insufficient security forces, the company requested the local government's armed forces department to send a militia team of forty people to strengthen security. Unexpectedly, some impure elements in the militia not only failed to provide security but, on the contrary, mutually shielded the large-scale theft of sugar, causing great losses to the people's state property. Here are some examples of the militia stealing:

On the evening of January 3rd, militiamen Zhang Yuzhen and Zhang Xizhen were caught stealing 30 jin of sugar; militia captain Zhang Yingchou stole 20 jin of sugar; militia squad leader Zhang Shuanglin stole 20 jin of sugar and sold it at a private merchant's inn in Dongming Street (there are witnesses); militiaman Li Dianzhang and five others stole dozens of jin of cargo rope, which were found in the militia dormitory; in addition, three thermos bottles and two white porcelain cups, worth about 230,000 yuan, were also stolen from the batch of goods. Besides these militiamen stealing themselves, a young woman was discovered stealing sugar on January 12th, and Zhang Shuzhuang, the militiaman in charge of security, pretended not to know. On January 16th, Comrade Wu Shunhua, an accountant from the Hengshui Pier Trade Union, picked up a bag of refined sugar in the ditch outside the North Street. The above are just a few known examples.

The Hengshui Department Store hired the militia to provide security at a wage of seven to ten jin of millet per person per day. Because of the cold weather, the company made more than ten sets of cotton-padded coats for them to keep warm and solved the problem of supper expenses for their night duty, so it can be said that they were well taken care of. After the thefts occurred, the Hengshui Department Store requested the local government's armed forces department to thoroughly investigate the matter in writing and orally, but no solution has been reached so far. I hope that the responsible comrades of the relevant departments will pay attention to this serious incident, investigate it, compensate for the losses, and give legal punishment to those who actively steal. In addition, political education should be universally strengthened among the militia to cherish state property, in order to overcome the backwardness and selfishness of the peasant class.

　　衡水县某些民兵不认真保护国家财产
    互相包庇偷盗百货公司食糖
    当地政府应认真处理严加教育编辑同志：
    河北省衡水百货公司在一月初接管中国百货总公司拨给的大批食糖（系代保管性质），由于该公司警卫力量不足，乃请求当地政府武装部调来民兵一队计四十名，以加强警卫。不料民兵中有一部分不纯分子，非但未起警卫作用，相反地却互相包庇大批盗糖，使人民国家的财产遭受到很大损失。兹将民兵偷窃的事例告诉你们：
    一月三日晚，查获民兵张玉振、张西振二人偷糖三十斤；民兵队长张英丑偷糖二十斤；民兵班长张双林偷糖二十斤，在东明街私商客栈中变卖（有人证）；民兵李殿章等五人偷捆货绳数十斤，在民兵的宿舍内发现；另有三个暖水瓶和两个白瓷口杯约值二十三万多元，也是从该批货物中偷去的。除这些民兵自己偷窃外，又曾于一月十二日发现有一青年妇女偷糖，而负责警卫的民兵张树庄则装作不知。一月十六日衡水码头工会会计员吴顺华同志在北街外水沟下边拾得炼糖一袋。以上只是举出几个已知道的例子。
    按衡水百货公司请民兵担任警卫工作，是按每人每日七至十斤小米的工资发给的。由于天冷，该公司作了十余套棉大衣给他们御寒，并解决他们夜间站岗的夜餐费问题，可以说是照顾得很好了。偷盗事情发生后，衡水百货公司曾书面与口头请当地政府武装部彻查，但至今尚未获得解决。我希望有关部门负责同志注意这一严重事件，予以追查，赔偿损失，并对主动偷窃者给以法律处分。此外，应普遍加强民兵爱护国家资财的政治教育，以克服农民阶级的落后和自私性。
