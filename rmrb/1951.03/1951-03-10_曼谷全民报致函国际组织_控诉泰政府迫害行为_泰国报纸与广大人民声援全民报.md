Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Bangkok news: In response to the illegal arrest and deportation order by the Thai government against Cai Zhihong, the editor-in-chief, and Wu Jianzhong, the publisher, of the overseas Chinese newspaper Quan Min Bao, the newspaper has written to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the New York Daily Worker and the London Daily Worker, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, respectively, requesting assistance.

In its letters to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the newspaper pointed out that the Thai government's measures infringed upon "the basic rights of human beings and the freedom of activity of legitimate organizations." The newspaper appealed, "We earnestly request you to support us in every possible way until we achieve victory in our struggle for the release of Cai and Wu and the legitimate survival of our newspaper."

In its letters to the New York Daily Worker and the London Daily Worker, the newspaper said, "You and we have always worked together for the common goal of permanent peace and people's democracy. We earnestly hope for your just support."

In its letter to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the newspaper pointed out that the Thai government's actions violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter concerning the maintenance of basic human rights and freedom of publication.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: The unreasonable arrest of Cai Zhihong, editor-in-chief, and Wu Jianzhong, publisher, of the overseas Chinese newspaper "Quan Min Bao" in Bangkok by the reactionary Luang Pibul government of Thailand has aroused opposition from Thai public opinion and the broad masses of the people. The Thai-language "Political Weekly" has published several articles in succession, expressing protest. The newspaper criticized the Thai government for "posing as the defender of American interests." The newspaper pointed out that this measure by the Thai government not only concerns overseas Chinese newspapers, but also affects "the freedom of Thai newspapers and people to express their thoughts." The Thai-language "Thai Voice Daily" believes that the Thai government's arrest of the persons in charge of Quan Min Bao is a serious event that damages the friendship between the Chinese and Thai people. Thai writer and former chairman of the Thai Newspaper Association, Nai Kura, wrote that the Thai government's measures to prohibit comments on international politics deprive the press and the people of their rights.

Many Thai workers, students, vocational youths, and people from all walks of life have sent letters of condolence to Quan Min Bao or personally went to the Immigration Bureau detention center to offer flowers to the arrested persons, expressing their sympathy for Quan Min Bao and Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong. Nai Ba Shi, chairman of the Thai Newspaper Association, Nai Su Li, editor-in-chief of Thai Voice Daily, and reporters from Thai newspapers such as Nakhon Sawan, Daily Mail, and Siam Nikorn also went to express their condolences.

    【新华社广州九日电】泰国銮披汶反动政府无理逮捕曼谷华侨报纸《全民报》总编辑蔡志宏和出版人吴建中，已激起泰国舆论和广大人民的反对。泰文《政治周报》连续发表了几篇论文，表示抗议。该报斥责泰国政府“以美国利益的维护者自居”。该报指出：泰国政府这一措施不但关系到华侨报纸，而且也影响到“泰国报纸和人民表达思想的自由权利”。泰文《泰声日报》认为：泰国政府逮捕全民报负责人，是破坏中泰两国人民友谊的严重事件。泰国作家、泰国报界公会前主席乃古腊撰文说：泰国政府禁止评论国际政治的措施，剥夺了报界和人民的权利。
