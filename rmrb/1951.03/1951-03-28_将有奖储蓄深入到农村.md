　　Extend Prize-Linked Savings to the Countryside
    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Bank of China began offering prize-linked savings, it has been welcomed by the broad masses of the people. Many peasants also buy a few when they come to town for the market. They say that if prize-linked savings were promoted in the countryside, it would definitely be welcomed by the peasants. The peasants in North and Northeast China who have gone through land reform have surplus funds to save; prize-linked savings in particular can attract them.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Liu Qianfeng's suggestion is very good. We believe that it is gradually becoming necessary to develop prize-linked savings in the countryside.

专栏：来信摘要

　　将有奖储蓄深入到农村编辑同志：
    自中国人民银行办理有奖储蓄以来，受到了广大人民的欢迎。许多农民在进城赶集的时候，也顺便要买几张。据他们说，假使把有奖储蓄的业务推广到农村里去，定会受到农民的欢迎。经过土地改革的华北和东北农民，是有余力储蓄的；尤其是有奖储蓄更可以吸引他们。
                                安阳公路管理段  刘前锋
    编者按：刘前锋同志的意见很好。我们认为在农村开展有奖储蓄事业是逐渐有了必要性。
