The chairman of the meeting, Lin Kengsheng, director of the Beijing Office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, delivered the opening speech. He said: "On this day of commemorating the fourth anniversary of 'February 28th,' American imperialism has blatantly invaded our sacred territory of Taiwan. But today, the people of Taiwan and the people of the whole country have awakened and are not as easily bullied as before. The people of Taiwan must unite with the people of the whole country to fight to the end to overthrow the American imperialist aggressors and their accomplice, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang." Li Ming and Weng Zhaoqi, students of Kaohsiung First High School who participated in the "February 28th" Uprising, gave detailed accounts of the course of the "February 28th" Uprising, fully demonstrating the unyielding fighting will of the Taiwan people.

　　Following this, Wu Xiuquan spoke, saying: "The struggle of the people of Taiwan and the struggle of the entire Chinese people have always been combined. We must deepen and expand the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and resolutely oppose the American imperialists' arming of Japan. As long as all the Chinese people participate in this struggle, we will have the confidence and strength to defend the cause of peace in China and Asia. At the same time, the day of the liberation of the people of Taiwan will be closer."

　　Ambassador Li Zhouyuan said: "For the complete liberation of Korea, for the complete liberation of Taiwan, for the liberation of all oppressed nations in Asia, and for lasting world peace, let us unite and fight to the end."

　　Li Jishen, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, pointed out in his speech: "The great movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea is inseparable from the liberation of Taiwan.
