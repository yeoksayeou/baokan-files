[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Relief Association, in accordance with the "Decision on Dealing with Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 29, 1950, has taken over the Canaan Orphanage, Dachang Nursery, and Ganyu Hutong Nursing Home, three relief organizations funded by American capital. These relief organizations were all tools of American imperialism for carrying out cultural aggression in China, and have committed numerous crimes against Chinese children during the decades since their establishment.

The Canaan Orphanage was founded in 1929 by American imperialist element Rilemei (Ruth R. Miller). Rilemei was responsible for the orphanage's work for more than 20 years. After the liberation of Beijing, her husband, Nie Shouguang (a Chinese national), served as the director, with Rilemei directing behind the scenes. The orphanage held complete control over the children's lives, deaths, marriages, and adoptions. For each child admitted, the parents were first required to fill out a "voluntary application" prepared by the orphanage, which was actually a contract of indenture. The "voluntary application" stated: "Due to poverty, I voluntarily send my child to the orphanage and completely sever ties with the family. The child's death, departure, marriage, or adoption is not to be questioned by the family. If the child displays bad behavior, he or she will be subjected to moral education." The so-called "moral education" included beating, scolding, confinement, and withholding food, among other forms of corporal punishment. The orphanage adopted a patriarchal management system to fool and insult Chinese children, ordering the children to call Rilemei and Nie Shouguang "Mom" and "Dad." The children's names were prefixed with foreign names such as "John," "Joseph," "Eve," and "Mary" before their own surnames, such as Liu John, An Eve, and Li Mary, so that the children would gradually forget their own parents and their own country. The orphanage currently houses more than 100 children, with no nannies. Instead, older children are used to manage younger children, with boys feeding cattle and sheep, chopping grass, stoking boilers, and cooking, and girls sweeping floors, scrubbing, washing clothes, and tidying rooms. Despite the heavy labor, the diet is extremely poor, with the children not even getting enough cornmeal buns and sorghum porridge each day, so the children's bodies are very small. After the liberation of Beijing, the orphanage not only did not change in any way, but further carried out anti-Soviet and anti-communist education. Because the children were isolated from the outside world for a long time and subjected to the reactionary enslavement education of American imperialism, they developed various reactionary ideas. For example, orphan Liu Joseph said: "America is better than Russia (referring to the Soviet Union). We should listen to God's instructions and help America fight Russia." When government personnel went to the orphanage to understand the situation, they found on the blackboard: "Please be careful of the devil's tricks," implying that the orphans should confront the government. Orphan Solomon, deeply poisoned by enslavement education, even tore up a picture of Chairman Mao. Recently, the orphanage instigated some orphans to organize a so-called "Home Student Self-Government Association," which included the reactionary clause "must not be confused with any political party" in its constitution. This reactionary behavior, which violates the Common Program, is intolerable to the Chinese people.

The deplorable situation at the Dachang Nursery is the same as at "Canaan." It was founded by American missionary Stephen in Dachang Town, Xugou County, Shanxi Province in 1926 and was originally named "Stephen Orphanage." It was renamed in 1941. When Shanxi was liberated in 1948, the orphanage chartered two airplanes to move to Beijing. The current director, Wang Zhen, does not separate his personal property from the nursery's property. Many of the orphanage's staff members are also his family members and relatives, and they often order the children to grind flour, make tofu, and carry water. Si Bingrong, a child taken in by the orphanage, died from overwork.

The Ganyu Hutong Nursing Home is another type of "relief organization" used by American imperialism to harm the Chinese people in the name of "charity." It houses some elderly people, but in reality, it uses the name of "charity" and "relief" to deceive people for money. Before the Beijing Relief Branch took over, the chairman of the nursing home, Shao Fude (an American), spread rumors to the people being housed, saying: "We Americans are not in charge anymore. The Liberation Army will take over, and we don't know how they will deal with you." He also transferred the nursing home's property and secretly took away various supplies.

The Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Relief Association has sent personnel to live in the three "relief organizations" to handle the handover and continue to understand the detailed situation of each institution in preparation for further reforms.

　　中国人民救济总会北京市分会
    接管美资办理的三个“救济机关”
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民救济总会北京市分会根据一九五○年十二月二十九日中央人民政府政务院《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定》，美资办理的迦南孤儿院、大常育幼院、甘雨胡同养老院三个救济机关予以接管。这些救济机关都是美帝国主义在中国进行文化侵略的工具，创办至今的数十年中，残害中国儿童的罪行是很多的。
    迦南孤儿院是美帝国主义分子瑞乐梅于一九二九年创办的。瑞乐梅负责该院工作二十余年，北京解放后，她的丈夫聂受光（中国人）担任院长，瑞在幕后指挥，该院对孩子握有生、死、嫁、娶的全权，每收一个孩子，先要家长填写由院方准备好了的“志愿书”，实际上是卖身的契约，“志愿书”上写着：“因家贫，自愿将儿女送给孤儿院，以后与家族完全断绝关系，小孩的死、走、嫁、娶，其家属不得过问，如有劣性者，则施以感化教育。”所谓“感化教育”即打骂、禁闭、不给饭吃等种种体罚。该院采取家长制度的管理方法来愚弄和侮辱中国儿童，命令孩子叫瑞乐梅、聂受光夫妇是妈妈、爸爸，孩子们的名字都是在“约翰”“约瑟”“夏娃”“马利亚”等外国名称之上再冠以自己的姓，如刘约翰、安夏娃、李马利亚等，使孩子们慢慢忘记了他们自己的父母，自己的国家。全院收容的儿童现共有一百多人，没有一个保姆，仅利用大孩子管小孩子，叫男孩子喂牛、喂羊、铡草、烧锅炉、做饭，女孩子扫地、擦地板、缝洗衣服、整理房间。在繁重劳役中，饮食则极其恶劣，每日玉米面窝窝头、高粱米粥还吃不饱，所以孩子们的身体都极为矮小。北京解放以后该院不但没有任何改变，而且进一步进行了反苏反共的教育。由于孩子们长期与外界隔绝和长期受美国帝国主义反动的奴化教育，所以养成了各种反动的思想，如孤儿刘约瑟说：“美国比俄国（指苏联）好，我们应当听神的指示，帮助美国打俄国”，政府工作人员去该院了解情况时，在黑板上发现：“请诸位要防备魔鬼的鬼计”，暗示孤儿们和政府对抗，孤儿所罗门由于中了很深的奴化教育的毒素，竟撕毁毛主席的像片。最近该院又唆使一部分孤儿组织所谓“家庭学生自治会”，在会章中竟有“不得与任何党派相混淆”的反动条文。这种违反共同纲领的反动行为，是中国人民决不能容忍的。
    大常育幼院的恶劣情况也和“迦南”一样，它是美国教士司提芬于一九二六年在山西徐沟县大常镇创办的，原名“司提芬孤儿院”，一九四一年始改今名，一九四八年山西解放时该院包了两架飞机，迁来北京，现任院长王镇的财产与育幼院财产是不分的，院内职员亦多系他的家属和亲友，经常命令儿童们磨面、磨豆腐、挑水等，被收容儿童司秉荣即因劳动过度而死。
    甘雨胡同养老院则是美帝国主义以“慈善”为名，用另一种方式来残害中国人民的“救济机关”，它收容了一些年老的人，实际是借“慈善”“救济”之名，进行欺骗财物之实，在北京市救济分会去接管前，该院董事长邵辅德（美国人）向被收容的人散布谣言说：“我们美国人不管了，由解放军接收，如何处理你们，不知道。”并转移该院财产，私自拉走各种物资。
    中国人民救济总会北京市分会已派出接管人员住在三个“救济机关”里，办理接交工作，并继续了解各院详细情况，以准备作进一步的改革工作。
