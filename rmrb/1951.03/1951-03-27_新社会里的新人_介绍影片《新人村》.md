　　New People in a New Society
　　--Introducing the Film "New Village"

　　"New Village" is a documentary depicting the transformation process of vagrants, pickpockets, bums, hooligans, and others.

　　In the past, vagrants in the evil city of Shanghai had large-scale organized factions. They lived a life of crime by means of forced begging, theft, fraud, pickpocketing, and even robbery. However, under the old system of dog-eat-dog and with the connivance and exploitation of the reactionaries, this phenomenon not only could not be eliminated but grew daily.

　　After liberation, in order to build Shanghai into a new and economically prosperous city and enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment, the People's Government began to transform these vagrants. The Second Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference passed a plan to transform vagrants, established labor production reformatories, and sent a large number of cadres to carry out the work of taking them in.

　　When the vagrants first entered the reformatories, they often resorted to beating cadres,抢water and food, and fighting because they did not understand the government's policies. At the same time, they suspected the government's policies. After the cadres' painstaking education, they finally realized who had forced them into the abyss of suffering and who had rescued them and enabled them to see the light again.

　　In the autumn of 1950, new miracles appeared on the vast wilderness along the Yellow Sea in northern Jiangsu: the weedy wasteland was transformed into fertile cotton fields, and four neat villages stood in the cotton fields. There were small-scale handicraft factories for ironwork, carpentry, and sewing, as well as schools, cooperatives, and well-equipped hospitals.

　　Who would have thought that the workers, students, and垦民 here were vagrants from Shanghai? Who could have imagined that these villages and large tracts of cotton fields were created by their own hands? These people, who had previously not engaged in production, have now become hardworking and honest working people. They study current events every day and hold criticism meetings every week to check their own shortcomings and their attitude towards labor. They live harmoniously and happily. People who were once emaciated and poisoned by opium have now become ruddy-faced and healthy, becoming skilled laborers. Many people have won the glorious titles of labor hero and production model. According to the government's plan, they will build buildings on this wilderness, equipped with electricity and running water; they will also build theaters, large factories, and middle schools.

　　Because this film is a documentary, its portrayal of characters is not deep enough, and its techniques inevitably have some flaws.

　　新社会里的新人
    ——介绍影片《新人村》
    《新人村》是一部描写流浪汉、扒手、瘪三、流氓等改造过程的记录片。
    游民在过去上海这个罪恶的城市里有规模很大的派系组织，他们用强讨、偷、骗、扒，甚至抢劫的手段来度着罪恶的生活。但在以前人吃人的社会制度下，加上反动派的纵容利用，这种现象非但不能消灭，反而日益增长起来。
    解放以后，人民政府为了把上海建设成经济繁荣的新上海，使人民都能过着安居乐业的生活，着手改造了这批游民。上海市第二届各界人民代表会议通过了改造游民的方案，成立了劳动生产教养所，并派大批干部进行收容工作。
    游民刚入所的时候，因为不了解政府的政策，往往发生殴打干部、抢水抢饭、打架的现象。同时，他们怀疑政府的政策。经过干部苦口婆心的教育以后，终于使他们认清了是谁把他们逼下火坑的？是谁把他们抢救出来，使他们重见了光明？
    一九五○年的秋天，在苏北沿黄海边一带广漠的大荒原上出现了新的奇迹：茅草丛生的荒原变成了肥沃的棉田，在棉田中矗立着四座房屋整齐的村庄。那里有铁工、木工、缝纫等初具规模的手工业工厂，有学校，有合作社，有设备良好的医院。
    谁又会想到这里的工人、学生、垦民便是来自上海的游民呢？谁能想到这几个村庄和大片的棉田是他们用双手创造的呢？这些过去不事生产的人，今天变为勤劳而诚朴的劳动人民了。他们每天学习时事，每周开检讨会；检查自己有什么缺点，劳动态度好不好。他们和睦而愉快地生活着。过去被料面毒害得面黄肌瘦的人，今天都变成脸色红润，身体健壮，成为劳动的能手。有许多人得到了劳动英雄、生产模范的光荣称号。他们并将根据政府的计划，要在这块荒原上盖起楼房，里面有电灯、自来水；还要建立剧场、大工厂、中学校。
    正因为这部影片是一部纪录片，它在人物的刻画上是不够深刻的，在技巧上也不免有若干缺陷。
