For a better life for the people, we demand peace and consolidate peace with our labor." Drozdov, a steelworker at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" factory, said: "I am determined to continue to commemorate the passage of the Law on Defending Peace with labor achievements of overproduction." Topchi, chairman of a collective farm in Moldova, said: "The Law on Defending Peace demonstrates our ardent desire to live in peace with the people of all countries. The Soviet people have never wanted war, but seek happiness. The Moldavian people will express their will to defend peace through creative labor."

	Soviet scientists and writers also unanimously hailed the Law on Defending Peace. Narivkin, a Stalin Prize winner and academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: "The people of the world will regard this law as a concrete manifestation of the Soviet Union's desire for peace. It has given us Soviet scientists new strength and encouraged us to participate more actively in the construction of the great communist project." Academician Tarle said: "This law will be immortalized in the annals of the struggle between the forces of progress, humanitarianism, and civilization, and the evil forces of reaction." Anichkov, President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, on behalf of Soviet medical workers, declared: "Soviet doctors especially cherish the Law on Defending Peace, because we want to enjoy the fruits of our peaceful labor together with all the Soviet people." Writer Pavlenko wrote in the Pravda: "The reason why the Soviet people demand peace is that they have contributed more to the cause of peace than anyone else, because they feel that their strength is strong enough to defend peace together with the peace-loving people of the world."
