　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: According to the German News Agency, the Preparatory Committee of the European Workers' Congress, composed of workers' representatives from France and Germany, has written to the central organizations of trade unions in European countries, international trade union organizations, and workers in several large enterprises, calling on them to elect representatives to participate in the European Workers' Congress Against the Remilitarization of Germany, which will be held in Berlin on March 24th and 25th. The letter points out that the remilitarization of Germany has deepened international tensions and the war crisis, leading to rising prices, increased taxes, reduced real wages, and a lack of necessities. For these reasons, and in order to unite workers from all European countries to fight against the remilitarization of Germany and stop the war crisis, the workers' representatives of France and Germany have unanimously agreed to convene the European Workers' Congress Against the Remilitarization of Germany. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee calls on all European workers to participate in this congress. The Preparatory Committee requests trade union organizations to help all industrial workers send representatives to Berlin.
　　According to a report in the French newspaper L'Humanité, the French National Committee responsible for preparing the congress has issued a declaration calling on all working people and trade union organizations to elect representatives to attend this congress and to immediately begin raising funds to organize the congress. The declaration states: The National Committee is convinced that the enthusiasm of the working people will guarantee the complete victory of the European Workers' Congress, and this meeting will be a decisive contribution to the cause of opposing West German remilitarization.

　　欧洲工人代表大会筹委会号召各国推选代表
    【新华社十三日讯】据德意志通讯社讯：由法德两国工人代表组成的欧洲工人代表大会的筹备委员会已写信给欧洲各国工会中央组织、国际工会组织和若干大企业的工人，号召他们推选代表参加将于三月二十四日和二十五日在柏林举行的欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化代表大会。信中指出，德国的重新军国主义化加深了国际紧张形势和战争危机，造成了物价的上涨、捐税的增加、实际工资的减低和必需品的缺乏。为了这些原因，而且为了团结欧洲一切国家的工人为反对德国重新军国主义化与制止战争危机而斗争，法国与德国的工人代表已一致同意召开欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化大会。因此，筹委会呼吁全欧工人参加这个大会。筹委会在信中要求各工会组织帮助一切产业工人派代表到柏林。
    另据法国人道报讯：法国负责筹备大会的全国委员会，已发表宣言，号召全体劳动人民和工会组织推选代表出席这一大会，并立即着手为组织此次大会募集经费。宣言称：全国委员会深信，劳动人民的积极性将保证欧洲工人代表大会的彻底胜利，这次会议对于反对西德重新军国主义化的事业，将是一个决定性的贡献。
