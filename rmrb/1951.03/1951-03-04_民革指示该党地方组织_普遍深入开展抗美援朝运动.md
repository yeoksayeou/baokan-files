The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Instructs Local Organizations to Universally and Thoroughly Carry Out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued instructions on February 27th, requiring its organizations at all levels to universally and thoroughly carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Home movement. The instructions stated:

The unfolding of the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Home movement demonstrates the great patriotic spirit of the Chinese people and has achieved tremendous practical results. However, the imperialists, headed by the United States, who have been defeated in Korea, are still unwilling to admit defeat, conspiring to arm Japan and West Germany, insisting on their war of aggression against Korea, and threatening world peace. Therefore, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement must be developed more broadly and deeply. In the future, it must be extended from central areas to remote areas, from large, medium, and small cities to rural areas; areas that have already been launched should deepen their efforts, and areas or strata that have not yet been launched should be mobilized. In terms of ideological understanding, it is necessary to more thoroughly and universally eliminate ideas of admiring, being friendly to, and fearing the United States, and to more firmly establish the views of hating, despising, and looking down upon American imperialism, as well as national self-esteem. In practical action, this movement should not be isolated but should be combined with land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities.

The instructions also stated: In carrying out propaganda work, new events in the development of current affairs should be used regularly to educate the people, and it should also be combined with the masses' experiences and their own interests to stimulate their patriotism and guide them to engage in practical patriotic movements. In organizing volunteer mobilization work, the most important thing is to call on people to continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in various ways; secondly, efforts should be made to promote the signing of patriotic pacts.

　　民革指示该党地方组织
    普遍深入开展抗美援朝运动
    【新华社二日讯】中国国民党革命委员会于二月二十七日发出指示，要求该党各地组织普遍深入地开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动。该指示称：
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动的展开，表现出中国人民伟大的爱国主义精神，收到了巨大的实际效果。但侵朝挫败的以美国为首的帝国主义者，现在还不肯承认失败，阴谋武装日本与西德，坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，威胁世界和平。因此，抗美援朝运动必须更广泛、更深入地发展。今后必须从中心地区推及偏远，从大中小城市及于农村；已经展开的地方深入下去，没有展开的地方或阶层发动起来。在思想认识上，要更彻底更普遍地消除崇美、亲美、恐美的思想，更巩固地建立仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义和民族自尊的观点。在实际行动上，不可使这一运动孤立起来，而应与土地改革和镇压反革命活动相结合。
    该指示又称：在进行宣传工作时，要经常以时事发展中新的事件向人民宣传，还要结合群众的经验和他们自身的利益，以激发群众的爱国心，引导他们从事于实际的爱国运动。在组织志愿动员工作方面，最重要的是号召以各种方法继续支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军；其次应该努力推广订立爱国公约。
