　　Review of "Production Front"
　　Hou Jinjing

　　The Chinese People's Liberation Army has not only won victories on the front lines, but also on the production front. However, this battle is against nature, against the economic disasters left behind by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and against the wounds left by long-term war.

　　The film "Production Front" shows a part of this great victory – the "North China Battlefield." From this documentary, we can see the brilliant achievements our soldiers have made on this front.

　　Let me first introduce the achievements of the "North China Battlefield": In agriculture, they cultivated a total of 389,489 mu of land, harvesting the equivalent of 36,058,929 jin of rice. In water conservancy projects, they repaired more than 20 rivers, completed 5,116,436 work units, and completed 13,095,379 cubic meters of earthwork. This is one of the great contributions of this heroic unit to the motherland. It is not only an important force in defending the motherland and safeguarding peace in East Asia and the world, but also an important force in building the motherland. Why? Chairman Mao once said:

　　"...because the vast majority of the People's Liberation Army comes from the working people, has a high degree of political consciousness and various production skills, and has undertaken production tasks and has production experience and a tradition of labor in the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan." (Chairman Mao's instructions on the army's participation in production and construction in 1950)

　　Indeed, as early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese People's Army, under the heavy siege of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and Japanese invaders, overcame difficulties by fighting on one hand and producing on the other. Today, the People's Liberation Army has made brilliant achievements in the new China's agricultural and water conservancy construction.

　　In the film, we see a vast expanse of desolate white saline-alkali land, with a few sparse and strong grasses shaking in the winter. This is the land above the Bohai Bay. The fertile black soil is covered by alkali and has been barren for many years. Japanese imperialism and Kuomintang reactionaries tried to develop it and seize it for themselves several times, but they all failed. However, a certain army corps opened up more than 127,000 mu of dry and irrigated land in 1950, built a power station, and built a 40-li-long canal, irrigating 7,000 mu of rice paddies. By the time of the autumn harvest, it had become a boundless farmland, with rice ears swaying in the wind. During the harvest season, thousands of commanders and fighters used improved tools to harvest and thresh the grain, and the threshing floor was filled with thick and joyful songs. When the rice was milled, it was already overflowing from the granaries, and the bags of rice were piled up like mountains. The People's Liberation Army conquered this land, making it bloom with happiness and grow abundant fruits.

　　In the picture, we also saw the troops in the mud, in ditches with knee-deep water, and in the hot summer weather, managing the arteries of the earth and carrying out dredging projects. The Chaobai River is a river that affects the lives and property of millions of people in more than a dozen counties in eastern Hebei. It has flooded in 1912 and 1939. In 1949 alone, the disaster affected more than 1.3 million people in eight counties in eastern Hebei, and the loss of agricultural products amounted to 50,000 jin of corn; the deaths and injuries of people and animals and the collapse of houses were not included. In Baodi County, only one and a half villages were not flooded. Therefore, the soldiers said, "We must annihilate the main enemy of water disasters in eastern Hebei and liberate 6 million mu of farmland." This is a very difficult project. From the northwest of Tong County to the mouth of the Jinzhong River, tens of millions of shovels were dancing and shining. The soldiers were barefoot, carrying baskets full of mud like shuttles. Everywhere there were slogans, songs, gongs, drums, and broadcasts. Thousands of award flags were inserted along the long river bank. The female comrades carried mud bricks, shouting, laughing, and working hard. In order to overcome the flood, they were competing with the male comrades. Their bodies were covered with mud, but their eyes were shining with brave and happy light. The task was completed in June, and the soldiers proudly said, "We have carried out a major battle to conquer the Chaobai River for the motherland and the people!"

　　Troop production is different from the decentralized individual production of farmers. The film powerfully depicts this aspect. It depicts how the command of this production army held meetings, how the commander issued orders, and how the leaders at all levels went to inspect the "terrain"; it also depicts the technical preparations, the opening of factories to manufacture tools. The workers are the soldiers in our army, and they were craftsmen of various handicrafts before joining the army. In order to adapt to the collective cultivation of large areas of land, they invited engineers, improved tools, and carried out planned production... All this shows that this is a collective production army with strong leadership, strict planning, and scientific organization. It enlightens us on the prospects for agricultural production in the new China. The film also prominently demonstrates the collective spirit of production, the army's enthusiasm for loving the motherland and the people, and the incomparably strong power accumulated in the army itself. When we see thousands of ducks swimming in the clear river, when we see soldiers fishing in the turbulent sea, when we see grains falling densely under the threshing machine, when we see soldiers resting, singing, laughing, and studying culture,... it makes us burst out with passion for loving the motherland, passion for loving our own army, and even arouses our incomparable hatred for the aggressors who destroy peace and destroy human happiness.

　　The People's Liberation Army is an army of the people, and it has a high sense of responsibility to the motherland, the people, and world peace. The film also tells us this: how the troops care for their war horses in production, how they improve their military skills, and how they stand on the rocks by the sea, under the "August 1st" military flag, staring unblinkingly at the East.

　　This is a true documentary, showing the potential power of the Liberation Army: it not only has the invincible power to defend world peace, but also has the strong power to build the motherland. And it affectionately shows the loyalty of the People's Liberation Army to the motherland and the people from production. Therefore, the film can also have strong and moving emotions, have a grand spirit, show the heroic troops, and also outline a clear background for this army – that is, the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland and the beautiful youth of the motherland.

　　评《生产战线》
    侯金镜
    中国人民解放军不仅在前线上打了胜仗，在生产战线上也打了胜仗。不过，这一仗是和自然界做斗争，和国民党反动统治所遗留下的经济灾害做斗争，和长期战争遗留下来的创伤做斗争。
    影片《生产战线》所表现的是这个大胜仗的一个组成部分——“华北战场”。从这个纪录片里，我们可以看到我们的战士们在这个战线上所取得的辉煌战绩。
    让我先来介绍一下“华北战场”所获得的成绩吧：他们在农业方面共耕种土地三十八万九千四百八十九亩，收获可折米三千六百零五万八千九百二十九斤。水利工程上，包修了二十多条河，施工五百一十一万六千四百三十六个，完成了一千三百零九万五千三百七十九土方。这就是这一支英雄部队对祖国的伟大贡献之一，它不只是捍卫祖国，捍卫东亚和世界和平的重要力量，而且还是建设祖国的重要力量。为什么呢？毛主席曾说过：
    “……是因为人民解放军绝大多数来自劳动人民中间，有着高度的政治觉悟和各种生产技能，并曾在抗日战争最艰苦的年月，担负过生产任务，具有生产的经验和劳动的传统。”（毛主席关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示）
    的确，早在抗日战争中，中国人民的军队在蒋匪和日寇重重围困之下，一面战争，一面生产，终于度过了困难。今天人民解放军，又在新中国农业、水利建设事业上建树了光辉的成绩。
    在影片上我们看见了一眼望不到边的荒漠的白沙碱滩，冬天里摇着几根稀疏的劲草。这是渤海湾上面的土地，膏沃的黑土被碱掩盖住了，多少年来荒废着。日本帝国主义，国民党反动派几次想把它开发出来攫为己有，都失败了。但是某兵团在一九五○年中却开出了十二万七千余亩水旱地，建立了电力站，修筑了长达四十里的水渠，灌溉了稻田七千亩。待到秋收的时候，成了一望无垠的农田，稻穗迎风摇摆着。大秋的时候，上千的指战员们用改良的工具来收割，打场，稻场上洋溢着浑厚而愉快的歌声。等到米碾出来的时候，已经大囤满，小囤流稻米袋子已经堆成山了。人民解放军征服了这块土地，使它开出了幸福的花朵，生长出丰饶的果实。
    在画面上我们也看到了部队在泥泞里，在水深到膝的沟渠里，在盛夏炎热的天气里，治理着大地的动脉，进行着浚河工程。潮白河是一条关系着冀东十几个县百万人的生命财产的河流，它在一九一二、一九三九年都曾发过大水，仅是一九四九年冀东八县受灾的人口就有一百三十多万，损失农产合玉米五万斤；人畜死伤，房屋倒塌还不计算在内。宝坻一个县只有一个半村庄没有水淹。所以战士们说“我们要歼灭冀东水患的主要敌人，解放农田六百万亩。”这是一个非常艰苦的工程，从通县的西北一直到金钟河的海口上，千万把铁锨舞动着，闪闪发光。战士们光着脚，穿梭似的抬着装满泥土的抬筐运送着。到处是口号声，歌声，锣鼓声，广播声。千百面奖旗插遍绵长的河岸。女同志们运着泥块，叫着，笑着，紧张地动作着，为着战胜洪水，她们和男同志在竞赛，身上沾满了烂泥巴，但是她们的眼睛都闪着勇敢愉快的光采。六月里完成了任务，战士们骄傲地说：“我们进行了一个大战役，为祖国为人民征服了潮白河！”
    部队生产和农民分散个体的生产是不同的，影片有力地描绘了这一方面。它描绘了这一支生产大军的指挥部怎样召开会议，司令员下达命令，各级首长去察看“地形”；也描写了许多技术方面的准备，开工厂制造工具。工人呢，是我们部队中的战士，他们在参军以前就是各种手工业的匠人。为了适宜集体化大块土地的耕种，他们请来了工程师，改良工具，进行有计划的生产，……这一切都说明这是集体的生产大军，有着坚强的领导，严密的计划，科学的组织。它向我们启示了新中国农业生产的远景。影片还突出地表现了集体主义的生产情绪，表现了部队爱祖国爱人民的热诚和部队本身所蕴蓄着的无比雄厚的力量。当我们看到成千成万只鸭子在清澈的河水里游泳的时候，看到战士在白浪滔天的海水里捕鱼的时候，看到谷粒在打稻机下面密密层层地落下来的时候，看到战士们一面休息一面唱着、笑着、学习着文化的时候，……就使我们奔放出热爱祖国的激情，奔放出热爱人民自己的军队的激情，更引起我们对破坏和平，破坏人类幸福的侵略者无比的仇恨。
    人民解放军是一支人民的军队，它对祖国、对人民、对世界和平有着高度的责任感。影片也告诉了我们这一点：部队在生产中是怎样关心他们的战马，怎样提高他们的军事技术，并且怎样站在海边的岩石上，站在“八一”军旗下面，目不转睛地监视着东方。
    这是一部真实的纪录影片，表现了解放军的潜在力量：它不只是有着不可战胜的保卫世界和平的力量，而且有着建设祖国的雄厚力量。并且亲切感人地从生产中表现了人民解放军对祖国对人民的忠诚不贰，因此影片也能够有着强烈感人的情绪，有着宏大的气魄，表现了英雄的部队，并且还给这部队勾出了鲜明的背景，——那就是祖国美丽的山河和祖国美丽的青春。
