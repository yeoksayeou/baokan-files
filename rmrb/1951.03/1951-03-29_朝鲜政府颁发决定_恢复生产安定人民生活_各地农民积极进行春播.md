　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decision on the 22nd, stipulating that the liberated areas of Korea should restore the production of necessities and promote commodity circulation in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. The decision pointed out: One of the important tasks of our industrial enterprises at present is to increase the production of necessities and food for workers, farmers, staff, and all the people. To correctly complete this important task, we must first strive to mobilize and utilize domestic labor and means of production, including raw materials and resources, to increase the production of goods. State-owned trading agencies and cooperatives should purchase food such as rice, vegetables, and fruits in areas with abundant agricultural products to improve the supply of goods in urban and rural areas.

　　The decision stipulated the production scale of necessities and food for 1951; and charged the State Planning Commission, in coordination with the Ministry of Industry and the Central Committee of Production Cooperatives, to formulate a plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy in 1951, and to rapidly restore the production of necessities.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. Korean farmers are actively carrying out spring planting in the difficult war environment. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic is doing its best to provide farmers with the necessary assistance. Farmers in Junghwa, Kangdong, Kangseo, Deokcheon and other counties in South Pyongan Province have started sowing spring wheat since March 10. Farmers in Sariwon, Hwangju and other places in Hwanghae Province have started sowing barley. The wartime production teams in various places are competing to carry out seed disinfection and composting in order to increase grain production and support the front lines, and it is expected that the spring wheat sowing plan will be completed by the end of this month.

　　Junghwa County in South Pyongan Province also plans to expand this year's spring wheat planting area to 280% of last year's.

    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁二十二日发布一项决定，规定朝鲜解放区要恢复生活必需品的生产，促进商品流通，以安定人民生活。决定指出：我们的工业企业当前的重要任务之一，就是增产工人、农民、职员及全体人民的生活必需品与食品。要正确地完成这一重要任务，首先应竭力动员和利用国内的劳动力及生产手段，包括原料和资源，增加商品的生产量。国营贸易机关与合作社应在农产富裕的地方收买米、蔬菜、水果等食品，以改善城乡商品的供应。
    决定中规定了一九五一年度生活必需品和食品的生产规模；并责成国家计划委员会协同产业省及生产合作社中央委员会，制订一九五一年人民经济恢复和发展的计划，迅速恢复生产必需品的生产。
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜农民正在艰苦的战争环境下积极进行春季播种。共和国内阁农林省正尽力给予农民们必要的协助。平安南道中和、江东、江西、德川等县农民已从三月十日开始播种春麦。黄海道的沙里院、黄州等地农民已着手播种大麦。各地的战时生产组为了增产粮食支援前线，争先地进行种籽消毒、堆肥等工作，预定本月底即可完成春麦播种计划。
    平安南道中和县并计划将本年度的春麦播种面积扩大到去年的百分之二百八十。
    朝鲜共和国内阁农林省根据农民的需要，曾于二月底向平安南道、黄海道、江原道等地农民发放了数百吨种籽。
