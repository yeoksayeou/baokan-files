Reaction to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Technician Zhang Shouyi's Self-Criticism
    To the Editors:
    I read the article "Workers at Jixian Pinggong Cotton Weaving Factory Still Subject to Oppression" in the "Letters from Readers" column of your esteemed newspaper on March 12th. Only then did I realize that I had indeed made serious mistakes. Although the factory administration had repeatedly educated me and my comrades had criticized and helped me, I could not correct my mistakes all at once. It was not until the rectification study last year that I further recognized my many shortcomings. I was very saddened to see my mistakes exposed to the people of the whole country in the newspaper. After a deep self-examination, I realized that my past behavior of insulting and oppressing my fellow workers was a manifestation of feudal residual ideas and a gangster-like style. I had completely lost the standpoint of the working class. From now on, I am determined to correct my past mistakes and establish the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly.
    Most of what was published in the newspaper is true. For example: (1) I am naturally frivolous. Once, while guiding female workers in winding yarn in the winding room, water suddenly splashed in from the window, wetting the yarn. After questioning, no one admitted it, so I scolded, "Too casual! This is not a brothel." (2) I wrongly dismissed the female worker Chen Guilan because she quarreled with the male worker Ji Qingyuan and refused to listen to advice. I did not obtain permission from the factory administration, but arbitrarily ordered her to leave the factory. After the administration understood the situation, they criticized me. (3) Sha Fumin changed the take-up gear, but I did not praise him in time, because I felt that doing it without going through me was messing around. This shows my lack of reliance on the working class and my lack of a learning attitude towards the masses.
    In short, although I have worked in the new society for two years and received a lot of education from the Communist Party and the People's Government, my progress has been very slow, and there are still many bad habits. From now on, I must thoroughly correct my mistakes and start anew. I sincerely accept the punishment I deserve for the mistakes I have made in the past.

### 技士张守义的自我检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    技士张守义的自我检讨编辑同志：
    三月十二日贵报“读者来信”栏登载“汲县平工棉织厂工人仍受压迫”一稿。我读后始醒悟到自己确实犯了严重的错误。以前工厂行政上虽然对我一再教育，及同志们对我进行了批评与帮助，但我对于自己的错误，总不能一下子改掉。去年在整风学习中，才进一步认识到自己的缺点很多。这次在报纸上见到我的错误被揭露在全国人民的面前，我很难过。经过我深刻的检查，认识到我过去那种污辱和压迫工人同志的行为，是封建残余思想的表现，是流氓作风。我完全丧失了工人阶级的立场。今后我下决心要痛改前非，树立全心全意为人民服务的观点。
    报纸上所登载的大部是事实。如：（一）我素性轻浮，有一次在络线室内指导女工络线，忽然由窗外洒进水来，浸湿了纱线。经追问没人承认，我就骂道：“太随便了，这里不是妓女院。”（二）我错误地开除女工陈桂兰，原因是她和男工计清源吵嘴，劝阻不听。我并未得到工厂行政上的许可，便蛮横地叫他离厂，经行政上了解情况后，对我提出了批评。（三）沙富民变换卷取齿轮，我没有及时加以表扬，原因是我觉得不通过我就是胡搞。这是我缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想和向群众学习的态度。
    总之，我虽然在新社会里工作了二年，受了共产党和人民政府的不少教育，但进步很慢，仍然存在着很多不良作风。从现在起，我一定要彻底改正自己的错误，重作新人。对以往所犯的错误，我诚恳地接受应得的处分。
