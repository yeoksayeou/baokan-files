Newspaper Review

(I) Northwest Masses Daily Examines the Paper's Provincialism
　　
The Xi'an Masses Daily published a special article on February 18 entitled "Why Does Our Newspaper Lack Northwest Character?" This was a public response to the criticism from the Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party that the Masses Daily did not comprehensively reflect the situation in the Northwest. In reviewing the lack of "Northwest Character," the article analyzed the use of manuscripts in October of last year, stating: In October of last year, the total number of words used for the Northwest region was over 300,000, of which news reports and communications from the Northwest Region level, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an City accounted for 258,000 words, more than 85 percent. Reports from the other four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang totaled only 43,000 words, less than 14 percent. The Northwest is a multi-ethnic region, and the living conditions and current struggles of the various ethnic groups are of concern to the entire Northwest and the people of the whole country, but the Masses Daily has very few reports on this aspect. The newspaper rarely sends reporters to ethnic minority areas, and it does not make full use of manuscripts from local newspapers that reflect ethnic minority issues. This serious one-sidedness confines the Masses Daily, a newspaper for the vast area and people of the Northwest, to Shaanxi Province or a corner of Xi'an. Therefore, it has attracted the attention of some comrades and Party committees who care about the newspaper. On January 25, the Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party wrote to the Masses Daily, saying: "Qinghai sends a considerable amount of manuscripts to the Northwest News Agency, but the Masses Daily publishes very few of them." "...Some manuscripts are worth publishing, and it is necessary to publish them. For example, the People's Daily reprinted a special article from the Qinghai Daily that the Masses Daily did not publish."

　　The newspaper published the criticism from the Qinghai Provincial Committee Propaganda Department and sincerely and frankly responded: "This is a concrete manifestation of a lack of a Northwest perspective. The essence of a lack of a Northwest perspective is a lack of a mass perspective. The Masses Daily should be a newspaper for the broad masses of the Northwest, but it has failed to adequately reflect the lives and needs of the masses in various parts of the Northwest, which is really not in line with the name 'Masses Daily.'" The article believes that the criticism from the Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee is a powerful spur and encouragement to improve the newspaper's work because the Masses Daily had long perceived the limitations and one-sidedness of its news coverage and had proposed the slogan of strengthening the Northwest character. However, "due to an insufficiently deep understanding of this issue, we have not taken the necessary measures that we should have." The article concludes by declaring: In the future, we will strengthen the mass character of the newspaper and devote 90 percent of our efforts to doing mass work to overcome limitations and one-sidedness. We will also send a large number of reporters to various regions to report on new figures and new events among the people in various places. At the same time, the main responsible comrades will personally preside over the research work and the utilization of newspapers from various provinces and regions, as well as improve the work of readers' letters and reading communication.

(II) "Learn to Speak to Millions of People"

　　"Learn to Speak to Millions of People" is the editorial of the Xi'an Masses Daily on February 22. The editorial called on and mobilized Party and government workers in the Northwest, especially the senior responsible comrades of the Party and government, to write articles for the Masses Daily, that is, to use the newspaper to speak to millions of people.
　
　Since March of last year, when the Party Central Committee called on responsible comrades at all levels to personally write articles for newspapers and periodicals, and the Northwest Bureau issued the "Decision on Responsible Comrades at All Levels Personally Writing Articles for Newspapers and Periodicals," the responsible comrades of the Party and government in the Northwest Region have written many articles for the Masses Daily. According to the editorial, "Forty-three main responsible comrades from the Northwest Administrative Region level and the various provinces have personally written 143 articles for the newspaper." As a result, the newspaper's guidance for practical work has been greatly enhanced, and the newspaper itself has shown some new atmosphere. For example, the thesis "Opposing Bureaucracy and Commandism" written by Comrade Xi Zhongxun, the article "On Two Positions and Two Sets of Practices in Mass Work in Land Reform" written by Comrade Ma Mingfang, and the special article "Implementing Financial and Economic Policies and Improving the Direction of Work" written by Comrade Jia Tuofu have all played a significant guiding role in the rectification and study movement of the entire Party, the land reform movement in the Northwest Region, and the correct development of financial and economic work.

　　However, the method of using newspapers to speak to millions of people and thereby promote work "has not attracted the widespread attention of the entire Party." "Thirty-seven main responsible comrades in the Northwest and the provinces have not yet written a word." Among them, some comrades have not yet recognized the great significance of the Party Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau's instructions on responsible comrades personally writing articles for newspapers and periodicals. They are "stuck at their past ideological level, bound by the ideological methods and working methods of empiricism and pragmatism, and lack analysis and research on their own work, so it is difficult for them to write articles that have information, analysis, and can truly solve problems." Therefore, some comrades have not written despite repeated urging; some comrades have perfunctorily responded; some say that writing articles is not "practical work" or not an important job; and others say: It is enough to do your own job well, why publish it in the newspaper? They feel that completing work tasks is their duty, and writing articles in the newspaper is promoting themselves... These erroneous ideas hinder the smooth development of newspaper work. At the same time, the Masses Daily itself has not been serious enough in implementing the instructions of the Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau. It has not regularly and actively organized responsible comrades to write articles. To this end, the editorial calls on all responsible comrades in Party and government departments at all levels to systematically think about, research, and summarize their work, and learn to use newspapers to speak to millions of people. The Masses Daily itself has decided to hold regular forums, set plans, come up with topics, and assign tasks, and to regard the organization of writing as an important task of the newspaper, in order to achieve the purpose of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses as instructed by the Party Central Committee.

### 报纸巡礼

专栏：报纸巡礼

　　报纸巡礼
  （一）西北群众日报检查该报的地方性
    西安群众日报于二月十八日发表了“为什么我们的报纸缺乏西北色彩？”的专文，这是对中共青海省委宣传部批评群众日报反映西北情况不全面的公开答复。该文在检讨“西北色彩”不足时，曾根据去年十月份的用稿情况分析说：去年十月份，全部西北用稿共计三十余万字，而西北区一级及陕西省、西安市的新闻通讯就占二十五万八千字，计百分之八十五强。其他甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等四省的报道，合计才有四万三千字，不足百分之十四。西北是一个多民族的地区，各族人民的生活状况与现实斗争，为整个西北以及全国人民所关切，但群众日报关于这方面的报道却很少。该报既很少派往各民族地区的记者，而对各地报纸所反映的各民族问题的稿件，又没有充分利用。这种严重的片面性，就把西北广大地区和广大人民的报纸——群众日报——局限于陕西一省或西安一隅。因此，就引起一些关心报纸的同志和党委的注意。一月二十五日，中共青海省委宣传部写信给群众日报说：“青海给西北新闻局发稿并不太少，但群众日报登出的极少。”“……有些稿子还可以登，而且有必要登，如群众日报未登的专稿，人民日报反而从青海日报上转载了。”
    该报原文刊登了青海省委宣传部的批评，并诚恳而坦白地回答说：“这是缺乏西北观点的具体表现。缺乏西北观点实质上就是缺乏群众观点。群众日报，应当是西北广大群众的报纸，但是未能很好地反映西北各地群众的生活和需要，实在不符《群众日报》的名字。”该文认为青海省委宣传部的批评，是改进报纸工作的有力鞭策和鼓励。因为群众日报早就察觉了新闻报道上的局限性与片面性，并提出过加强西北色彩的口号。但是“由于对这问题认识不够深刻，因而没有采取应有的必要的办法。”该文最后宣称：今后决以加强报纸的群众性，以百分之九十的力量做好群众工作，来克服局限性与片面性。并将抽出大批记者，深入各地区报道各地人民的新人物与新事情。同时由主要负责同志亲自主持研究工作与对各省各地报纸的利用，以及健全读者来信与读报通讯工作。
  （二）“学会向千百万群众讲话”
    “学会向千百万群众讲话”是西安群众日报二月二十二日的社论。该社论号召和动员西北的党政工作者，尤其是党和政府的高级负责同志给群众日报写文章。也就是利用报纸对千百万群众说话。
    自从去年三月，党中央号召各级负责同志亲自为报刊写文章，和西北局发布“关于各级负责同志亲自为报刊写文章的决定”后，西北区的党和政府的负责同志，曾给群众日报写过不少文章，据该社论说：“仅西北大行政区一级和各省党和政府的主要负责同志，已有四十三人亲自动手给报纸写了一百四十三篇文章。”因而大大地增强了报纸对于实际工作的指导，报纸本身也呈现出一些新气象。例如：习仲勋同志所写《反对官僚主义、命令主义》的论文，马明方同志所写《论土地改革中群众工作中的两种立场和两套作法》，以及贾拓夫同志所写《贯彻财经政策与改进工作的方向》等等专文，对于全党的整风学习运动和西北区土地改革运动以及财经工作的正确开展，都起了极大的指导作用。
    然而，运用报纸向千百万群众说话，并借以推动工作的方法，“并没有引起全党的普遍注意。”“西北和各省的主要负责同志，还有三十七人未动笔。”其中，某些同志还没有认识到党中央与西北局关于负责同志亲自为报刊写文章的重大意义。他们“停留在已往的思想水平上，为经验主义和事务主义的思想方法与工作方法所束缚，对本身工作缺乏分析研究，因此也就很难写出有情况，有分析，并真能解决问题的文章。”因而有些同志曾经再三催促而不动笔；有的同志却潦草应付；有的说写文章不是“实际工作”，或不算什么重要工作；更有的说：本身工作做好就算了，何必发表在报上？他觉着完成工作任务是本分，在报纸上写文章是宣传自己…………。这些错误思想，妨碍了报纸工作的顺利开展。同时，群众日报本身，在执行中央与西北局指示上也不够认真。还没有经常主动地组织负责同志写稿等。至此，社论号召各级党和政府部门所有的负责同志，把自己的工作加以系统地思考、研究和总结，学会利用报纸向千百万群众说话。群众日报本身决定定期召开座谈会，订计划，出题目，分配任务，把组织写稿当成报社工作的一个重要任务，以此来达到党中央所指示的联系实际、联系群众的目的。
