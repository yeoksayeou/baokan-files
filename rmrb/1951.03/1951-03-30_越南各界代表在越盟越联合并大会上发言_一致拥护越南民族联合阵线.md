Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 25th: At the National Congress convened to merge the Viet Minh and Viet Lien, representatives of various people's organizations, political parties, and religious groups in Vietnam, as well as prominent figures, expressed their opinions on the issue of national unity. These opinions helped the Congress draft a program, laying the foundation for a broad and powerful national united front in Vietnam.

    Tran Dan Yuan, Secretary-General of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, analyzed the role of the Vietnamese working class within the national united front in his speech. Tran Dan Yuan reviewed the Vietnamese working class's struggles over the past twenty years, their achievements in armed resistance, and their contributions to national construction. He succinctly pointed out the main tasks of Vietnamese workers, working people, and trade unions: to establish a strong trade union composed of all manual and mental laborers; to closely unite with the peasants who constitute the basic driving force of the Vietnamese revolution; to closely unite with the bourgeoisie and develop wartime industry; to unite more closely with workers and working people in enemy-occupied areas in order to prepare for an early general counter-offensive together with the local people; and to increase production and carry out other construction work.

    Nguyen Thai, Deputy Secretary-General of the Vietnam Peasants' National Salvation Association, stated that Vietnamese peasants hoped to unite with people from other strata of society. He said: Vietnamese peasants have been tempered through years of fighting and participation in the people's government. They have a good mentor - President Ho Chi Minh; a brother - the most revolutionary class, the working class; and some good friends. He said: As a result of rent and interest reduction, peasants are participating more actively in production and armed resistance.

    Le Thi Xuyen, Chairman of the Vietnam Women's Union, emphasized in her speech the need to pay more attention to the organizational work of women, so that women can become a powerful force in armed resistance and national unity. She briefly listed the work plan of the Vietnam Women's Union. The purpose of this plan is to consolidate and develop the unity between Vietnamese women and female workers, rural women, and progressive intellectual women; to improve the living standards of women, especially female workers and rural women; to enhance the social status of women; and to increase the number of women participating in the people's government and technical organs.

    Hoang Minh Chinh, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Youth Union, analyzed the role played by the Youth Union in establishing the Vietnam National United Front. He pointed out that it is necessary to expand the foundation of the Youth Union in enemy-occupied areas in order to frustrate the French imperialists' conspiracy to divide and buy over young people. At the same time, the Vietnam Youth Union must strengthen its ties with Lao and Cambodian youth, as well as the world's democratic youth, in order to further strengthen the world's peace and democracy camp.

    Representatives of Vietnamese intellectuals, industrialists, Buddhists, and Catholics all unanimously expressed in their speeches their willingness to unite with people from all walks of life to drive out the French imperialists and build an independent, progressive, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam.

　　越南各界代表在越盟越联合并大会上发言
    一致拥护越南民族联合阵线
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社北越二十五日讯：在为合并越盟和越联而召开的全国代表大会上，越南各人民团体、政党和宗教团体的代表以及著名人士，对全民团结的问题都发表了意见。这些意见帮助了代表大会起草了一个纲领，为越南的广大而强有力的民族统一阵线奠定了基础。
    越南总工会总书记陈淡元在演说中分析了越南工人阶级在民族统一阵线内所发挥的作用。陈淡元回顾了越南工人阶级过去二十年的斗争、武装抗战和进行国家建设的成就。他扼要地指出越南工人、劳动人民和工会的主要任务是：建立一个由一切体力劳动者和脑力劳动者参加的强有力的工会；与构成越南革命基本动力的农民密切团结；与资产阶级密切团结，发展战时工业；与敌占区内的工人和劳动人民更密切地团结，以便与当地人民共同准备早日总反攻；增加生产和进行其他建设工作。
    越南农民救国协会副总书记阮泰表示越南农民希望与其他阶层的人民团结。他说：越南农民在多年的战斗和参加人民政权的过程中，已经得到了锻炼。他们有一个好的导师——胡志明主席；有一个兄弟——最革命的阶级工人阶级；还有一些好的朋友。他说：由于减租减息的结果，农民都更积极地参加着生产工作和武装抗战。
    越南妇女联合会主席黎氏钏在演说中强调必须更注意妇女的组织工作，使妇女成为武装抗战和全民团结中的一股强大的力量。她扼要地列举了越南妇女联合会的工作计划。这个计划的目的是要巩固和发展越南妇女与女工、农村妇女和进步知识分子妇女间的团结；提高妇女特别是女工和农村妇女的生活水平；提高妇女的社会地位；增加他们参加人民政权和技术机关的人数。
    越南青年联合会总书记黄明正分析了青年联合会在建立越南民族统一阵线中所发挥的作用。他指出必须在敌占区内扩大青年联合会的基础，以便挫败法帝国主义者分化和收买青年的阴谋。越南青年联合会同时必须加强与老挝柬埔寨青年以及世界民主青年间的联系，以便更进一步地加强世界和平民主阵营。
    越南知识分子、工业界和佛教徒、天主教徒的代表，在发言中都一致表示愿与其他各界人民团结一致，把法国帝国主义者赶出去，建立一个独立、进步、民主、繁荣和强大的越南。
