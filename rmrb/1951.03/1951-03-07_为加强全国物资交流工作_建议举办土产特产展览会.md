To Strengthen National Material Exchange Work
Suggest Holding a Native and Special Products Exhibition

To the Editor:

In order to broadly develop national native product exchange work, I suggest holding a national native and special product exhibition. Through the exhibition, we can conduct a more systematic investigation and introduction of native and special products from various regions across the country, in order to promote native product exchange.

Organizing native product exchange is the central link in revitalizing the national economy at present. Although significant achievements have been made in native product exchange through the efforts of state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private businesses, according to the characteristics of China's vast territory and abundant resources, with a wide variety of native and special products, phenomena such as products being buried in mountainous areas and remote villages with inconvenient transportation, or circulating within a small scope, and failing to exert their due effect, still exist. For example, a large amount of licorice root and hemp bark produced in Pu, Ji, and other counties in Shanxi cannot be sold. A large quantity of pickled vegetables produced in Tanghui Township, Jiaxing, has been stockpiled since liberation because foreign merchants no longer purchase them. Some farmers have had to sell them below cost just to survive the famine.

In order to widely introduce China's valuable native and special products, improve the production and processing of native products, expand the market for native products, and ensure reasonable prices, it is very necessary to hold a national native product exhibition. I believe that this kind of exhibition can first be held in major administrative regions (regions rich in native products can also use provinces as units), and after selection, they can be summarized to participate in the national exhibition.

　　为加强全国物资交流工作
    建议举办土产特产展览会编辑同志：
    为了广泛开展全国性的土产交流工作，我建议举办一个全国性的土产特产展览会。通过展览会，可以对全国各地区的土产特产进行较有系统的调查和介绍；以便推进土产交流。
    组织土产交流是目前振兴全国经济的中心环节。虽然在国营贸易公司、合作社和私营商业的努力下，使土产交流获得很大成绩。但根据我国地大物博土产特产种类繁多的特点，埋没在山区和交通不便的乡村，或是流转于狭小范围内，不能发挥其应有的效用等现象是存在的。如山西蒲、吉等县所产的大量甘草和麻皮都卖不出去，嘉兴塘汇乡出产的大宗腌菜，自解放后由于外商不去收购，大量积存，某些农民为了度荒，也只得低于成本售出。
    为了广泛的介绍我国珍贵的土产特产品和改进土产品的生产和加工工作，扩大土产品的市场，保证其合理的价格，举办一个全国性的土产展览会是很必要的。我认为这种展览会可先在各大行政区举办（土产丰富的地区也可以以省为单位），加以甄选后，再汇总参加全国性的展览会。
