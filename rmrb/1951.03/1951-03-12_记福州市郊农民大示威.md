　　Record of a Massive Farmers' Demonstration in the Suburbs of Fuzhou
The vast number of farmers in the suburbs of Fuzhou held an unprecedentedly grand "Oppose American Imperialism's Rearmament of Japan" demonstration and parade simultaneously in three districts on the evening of the old lunar calendar's "Lantern Festival." As many as 50,000 farmers participated in the parade. At gatherings in each district, the "Patriotic Pledge," to be jointly observed by all suburban farmers in the city, was also passed.

　　Farmers' teams of all kinds from the four suburban districts converged at the gathering points: seventy percent of the male and female farmers walked barefoot, with members of the farmers' associations shouting slogans and beating drums. Organized groups of women members raised hoes, sickles, rakes, and carrying poles. Winter schools in various townships mostly organized waist drum teams (there are currently 5,000 farmers attending winter school in Hongshan District alone). Militia members from various townships wore red armbands and carried rifles and spears, and even more farmers brought out thousands of various weapons: iron forks, iron rods, and wooden sticks. The farmers' armament appeared unprecedentedly strong. In the队伍隊伍 There were also farmer "aid teams" carrying medicine bags, and children's teams singing songs. Forty-odd monks from Xichan Temple in Hongshan District, who participated in labor, came to parade. Farmers from Zhanban and Huqian townships drove two head of draught cattle that they had been allocated during the land reform, with slogans written on the backs of the cattle: "The plough cattle have returned home, the farmers are actively producing, resist America and aid Korea!"

　　During the parade, the suburban farmers of the city, who had suffered deeply under the Japanese invaders, expressed a particularly strong will to oppose the American rearmament of Japan. Farmers from Zhanban Township carried a large banner with the words "Blood debts must be repaid with blood." The brothers Xu Yuankai and Yongnian from that township had been innocently killed by the Japanese invaders. Therefore, the militia of that township also carried a large "Letter of Determination" that read: "Compatriots! The above facts are only a small part of the many blood debts left by the Japanese imperialist invasion of us... Our entire township's militia swears to avenge Xu Yuankai brothers with the determination to oppose the American imperialists' rearmament of Japan!" In Shisanqiao, Gushan District, more than twenty farmers were tied together by the palms with iron wire and pushed into the river, and most of them drowned. In Xiaoban Township, there are three known women who were raped by the Japanese invaders. The virgin Wang ×× was gang-raped by more than a dozen Japanese invaders while chopping firewood. Ke Jingxuan, a farmer in Xiangyuan Township, was unwilling to do hard labor for the Japanese invaders, so they nailed his eyelids to a chair. In Xiahu Township, Gaishan District, because the work assigned to repair the airport was not enough, the Japanese invaders set fire to farmer Jiang Jiaying's thatched house and the nearby temple. Four jia of houses in Xiangyuan Township were bombed by the Japanese invaders, killing more than twenty people. The mother, younger brother, and younger sister of Xu Heming, director of the Farmers' Association, were killed in the bombing, and he himself was injured. Recently, he put forward the slogan "Organize, resist America and aid Korea," mobilized from house to house, and 1,700 people from the township came to participate in the parade. Almost everyone in the township came. Cai Shuidang, the director of the Xiaoban Township Farmers' Association, who actively participated in the parade, said: "When the Japanese devils were here, every farmer had to salute when passing them, women had to be molested, and had to put on a smiling face when seeing them, and had to smile even when they were beaten... This was completely slavery! If the United States wants the Japanese devils to treat us like cattle and horses again, we will fight them to the death!"

　　The vast, awakened suburban farmers have already responded to the call to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions: After Xiaoban Township in Gushan District held a meeting to resist America and aid Korea in the whole district, a propaganda meeting was also held in the township, and the next day the farmers in the township completed 97 percent of their grain delivery to the government. The militia in various townships have rapidly grown in strength and intensified their training, effectively suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In Hengyu Township, four heinous despots were executed, which further consolidated the farmers' own organization. When the farmers realized that this parade was to show their strength to defeat American imperialism and Japanese imperialism, they were very enthusiastic about participating. When the farmers in Guozhai Township, where land reform was underway, were holding a mass meeting, they learned that there would be a parade and unanimously shouted: "Down with American imperialism! Everyone go to the parade!" Zheng Baoyu's sister-in-law from Gaohu Township brought her three children into the city and left them with relatives so that she could go to the parade herself. Wang A'mei (male) mobilized his wife and five members of his family to go to the parade. Chen Quansao, who was sixty-two years old, was very excited to participate in the parade after being allocated five and a half dou of land in the land reform, and walked spiritedly in the procession. The farmers from Zhanban Township, fifteen li away from Fuzhou, in addition to the original parade in their own township, unanimously rushed to Fuzhou to join the large parade.

　　Countless onlookers in the city greeted this mighty farmers' procession with astonished and admiring eyes. People were saying: "After seeing the large-scale demonstrations and parades of women, children, doctors, and so many farmers today, I truly believe that we will definitely break the American imperialists' conspiracy of aggression." When the parade passed through Gulou, where the "Lantern Festival Propaganda Station" of the Provincial Senior Commercial School was located, four or five hundred spectators gathered there, and all the spectators turned around and applauded the farmers' procession. Many people shouted angrily when they saw "Blood Debt!" and "Letter of Determination." The parades in each district lasted about three hours along the streets, and it took a long time for those far away to get back until midnight, but the farmers victoriously completed this great demonstration movement with unprecedentedly high morale.

　　Editor's Note: This newsletter reflects the farmers' enthusiastic sentiment in resisting America and aiding Korea, which is good. It is hoped that all localities can report on the anti-American and aid-Korea movement in rural areas in depth.

　　记福州市郊农民大示威
    福州市郊广大农民，在旧历“元宵”节日的晚上分三个地区同时举行了空前壮大的“反对美帝国主义重新武装日本”示威游行，参加游行的农民达五万人。各区的集会上并通过了全市郊农民共同遵守的《爱国公约》。
    来自四郊各区形形色色的农民队伍，在各集中地点汇合起来：百分之七十的男女农民赤着足走来，农会会员们呼着口号，敲着锣鼓；整队的妇女会员们高举着锄头、镰刀、铁耙、扁担；各乡冬学大都组织了腰鼓队（单洪山区现有五千农民上冬学）；各乡民兵围着红臂章，荷着步枪及长矛，更多的农民拿出了千百支各样的武器：铁叉、铁杆和木棒。洪山区和小桥区还有民兵骑着马、背着枪走在队伍中间。农民的武装显得空前强壮。在队伍中还有背着药包的农民“救护队”；唱着歌的少年儿童队。洪山区西禅寺有四十几个参加了劳动的和尚前来游行。战坂、湖前两乡农民赶了两头土地改革中分得的耕牛前来参加，牛背上的标语写着：“耕畜回了家，农民积极生产，抗美援朝！”
    在游行中，饱受日寇摧残的市郊农民们，表示出分外坚强的反对美国武装日本的意志。战坂乡农民举着“血债要用血来还”的大字标语。该乡农民许元凯、永年两兄弟曾无辜被日寇杀害。因此，该乡的民兵更抬着一幅大字的《决心书》，写着：“同胞们！上面的事实只是日本帝国主义侵略我们，留下许多血债的一点……我们全乡民兵誓以反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的决心，来为许元凯兄弟复仇！”鼓山区十三桥有二十个多农民被用铁线把手心穿连起来，推到河中，大部都淹死了。小坂乡被日寇强奸的妇女已知名的有三人，闺女王××在砍柴时被十几个日寇轮奸；象园乡农民柯经煊因不甘心给日寇作苦工，致把他两个眼皮钉在椅子上；盖山区霞湖乡因派工修飞机场出工不够，被日寇放火烧了农民江家英的草房和附近的大庙。象园乡有四个甲的房子被日寇轰炸了，炸死二十几人。农会主任徐和铭的母亲、弟、妹三人被炸死，他自己也受了伤。最近他提出“组织起来，抗美援朝”的口号，逐户深入动员，全乡有一千七百人来参加游行，全乡人几乎都来了。积极来参加游行的小坂乡农会主任蔡水党说：“日本仔在时，我们每个农民走过他们身旁都要行礼，女人要被调戏，见到他们要装笑脸，被他们打了还是要笑，……这完全是做奴隶呀！美国再想叫日本仔来把我们当牛马，我们和他们拼命！”
    广大觉悟了的市郊农民，已经用实际行动响应了抗美援朝：鼓山区小坂乡在全区开了抗美援朝会议后，本乡也召开了一个宣传大会，第二天全乡农民缴公粮就完成了百分之九十七。各乡民兵迅速壮大，并加紧操练，有力地镇压了反革命分子。横屿乡枪毙了四个罪大恶极的恶霸，更巩固了农民自己的组织。当农民认识到这次游行是表示自己有力量战胜美帝国主义和日本帝国主义时，都非常热烈地要求参加。正在进行土地改革的郭宅乡农民开群众大会时，知道将要游行，便一致高呼：“打倒美帝国主义。全体去游行！”高湖乡郑宝玉嫂把三个小孩带进城，放在亲戚处，自己去游行。王阿妹（男）动员他妻子及一家五口人前往游行，六十二岁的陈铨嫂在土地改革中分到了五斗半地，非常兴奋地参加游行，精神抖擞地走在队伍中。离福州十五里的战坂乡农民除原定在本乡游行外，并一致赶到福州加入了游行的大队。
    无数围观的市民们，以惊异和敬佩的眼光迎接这壮大的农民队伍。人们在说：“这几天看了妇女、儿童、医生和今天这样多农民的大示威游行，真相信我们一定能打破美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。”游行行列经过鼓楼时，那里原有省立高级商业学校的“元宵宣传站”，有四五百观众聚集在那里，观众们全部转过来鼓掌欢迎农民队伍，很多人看见《血债！》和《决心书》时，愤怒地喊起来。各区游行经过大街约三小时，路远的要到半夜才能赶回去，但农民们以空前高涨的情绪，胜利地完成了这一伟大的示威运动。
    编者按：这篇通讯反映了农民抗美援朝的热烈情绪是好的。希望各地均能深入报导农村中的抗美援朝运动。
