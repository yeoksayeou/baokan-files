　　Severely Punish the Poison Gas War Criminals
    After suffering heavy defeats in Korea, the American aggressors used suffocating poison gas bombs on the Han River front on February 23. This brutal crime of violating international law once again proves that the American aggressors are the public enemy of human civilization, and therefore they must be severely punished by human justice.
    This bestial behavior of the American aggressors is by no means accidental. After the Second World War, the United States had been sheltering Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals headed by Hirohito, and made Shiro Ishii, the manufacturer of Japanese bacteriological weapons, a guiding war criminal for the United States to research and manufacture bacteriological weapons. Truman publicly delivered a speech on November 30 last year, revealing the sinister attempt of the American aggressor troops to use terror weapons which were unanimously advocated by the peace-loving people of the world to be banned. Now the fact that the American troops invading Korea used poison gas is ironclad proof that the American aggressors deliberately used terror weapons against the peace-loving people of the world.
    The people of China, Korea, and the world must not tolerate the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors. We want to announce to the world that the American war criminals who are inhumane, release poison gas, or use other terror weapons to carry out dying, bestial destruction must be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. The American officers and soldiers currently invading Korea, those who ordered the release of poison gas or took the lead in carrying out the poison gas command, must also be severely investigated and prosecuted as poison gas war criminals.
    The bestial behavior of the American aggressors is entirely a desperate struggle, and its ultimate fate of failure is already doomed. The Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, who are further angered by the bestial acts of the American aggressors, must unite more closely, continue their efforts, finally defeat the American aggressors, bring the war criminals to justice, and accept the final judgment of human justice.

### 严惩毒气战犯

　　严惩毒气战犯
    美国侵略者在朝鲜连续遭到惨重失败之后，竟于二月二十三日在汉江前线使用了窒息性的毒气炸弹。这一破坏国际公法的残暴罪行，又一度证明了美国侵略者是人类文明的公敌，因而它必定要受到人类正义的严重惩罚。
    美国侵略者的这种兽性行为，绝不是偶然的。美国在第二次世界大战以后，就一直庇护了以裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯，并使日本细菌武器的制造者战犯石井四郎成为美国研究与制造细菌武器的指导者。杜鲁门在去年十一月三十日曾公开发表演说，透露美国侵略军准备使用为世界爱好和平人民所一致主张禁用的恐怖武器的罪恶企图。现在侵朝美军使用毒气的事实，更是美国侵略者蓄意对世界爱好和平人民使用恐怖武器的铁证。
    中国、朝鲜和全世界人民决不能容忍美国侵略者的滔天罪行。我们要向全世界宣布，对于灭绝人性、施放毒气，或使用其他恐怖武器，作垂死的兽性破坏的美国战争罪犯，必须彻底追究，予以严惩。对于目前侵朝美军官兵，对下令施放毒气或为首执行放毒命令者，亦必严加追究，以毒气战犯论罪。
    美国侵略者的兽性行为完全是一种绝望的挣扎，它最后失败的命运是已经注定了的。为美国侵略者的兽行所愈加激怒了的中朝人民与世界爱好和平人民，一定要更加团结起来，继续努力，最后击败美国侵略者，把战犯们追拿归案，承受人类正义的最后审判。
