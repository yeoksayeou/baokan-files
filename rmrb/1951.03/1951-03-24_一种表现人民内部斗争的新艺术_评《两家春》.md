　　Many people who have seen the film "Steel Will" praise it as a good work because it depicts the heroic and tragic combat atmosphere of the People's Liberation Army through the sharp struggle between two factions. "Two Families' Spring," on the other hand, presents a different scenario. The characters are all upright individuals, all kind-hearted farmers who have turned over a new leaf. There are also serious struggles, such as the struggle over marriage issues depicted in the film. However, this struggle is merely the struggle between new and old ideas, between new and old systems, among these characters. There is no villain or buffoon interspersed in the middle. Precisely because of this, it constitutes a rather "harmonious" struggle and becomes a comedy depicting the new society and new people. The harmony of the plot precisely demonstrates the unity of art and politics. Only in this new countryside after liberation is it possible for the countless tragedies of the old society to be transformed into comedies today.

　　The film opens with a wedding scene. Chui'er and Xiaoyong from Daliu Village are getting married. This marriage is unreasonable: Chui'er is twenty years old, while Xiaoyong is only nine. The primary reason for this marriage is parental arrangement, but it is also mixed with some past affections. Originally, Chui'er and the labor model Dakang are in love, and both are good at labor, forming a marriage based on labor relations. However, due to the old marriage system, she was arranged by her father to be engaged to Xiaoyong. Their marriage was also formed in hardship. Chui'er's father and Xiaoyong's father went out to escape the famine caused by feudal bureaucrats and landlords, and Chui'er and Xiaoyong's mother also experienced hardship together during the famine. Therefore, this increased Chui'er's father's stubborn attitude towards this marriage, always feeling that he owed a debt to his deceased old friend if the marriage was not completed. Chui'er was unwilling, partly due to her own weakness and partly because of the affection of the older generation, failing to resolutely resist her father and wavering in her determination to marry Dakang. This marriage itself is a complex combination of force and emotion. In addition, the village cadres' attitude towards this matter also went through struggle, but the village chief finally agreed to the marriage, with the mistaken view of treating the marriage event as a means of solving the productive forces by taking care of those who had turned over a new leaf. Of course, due to the extreme age difference, this contradiction could not be overcome. Furthermore, after Chui'er married into the family, she witnessed the unfortunate ending of a "waiting-for-husband daughter-in-law" marriage in the village, and troubles arose, eventually leading to illness and delaying production. Xiaoyong also faced ridicule from children at school, becoming unable to attend school and neglecting his studies, and the child also became dull. Everyone's good intentions actually caused pain, weighing on the hearts of both families. Finally, after the explanation of Qiaoling, the director of the village women's federation, and inspired by the new Marriage Law, both families willingly agreed to Chui'er and Xiaoyong's divorce and the completion of Dakang and Chui'er's marriage. Both the divorce and the marriage ended in comedy.

　　This film handles many aspects with new people and new perspectives, thus it can transform the tragedies of the past into today's comedies. For example, Dakang does not appear in the posture of a love rival towards Xiaoyong. Dakang realizes that this is the poison left over from the old society, so he is always friendly to Xiaoyong and has no resentment towards both parents, only criticizing Chui'er's weakness. When the two families divorced, they realized the truth through factual education and maintained a harmonious attitude: not mutual hatred, but mutual care. Xiaoyong's mother recognized Chui'er as her goddaughter and asked Xiaoyong to personally deliver clothes. The village chief also conducted self-criticism of his own mistakes. Due to the political harmony of the people in the new society (because everyone is a farmer who has turned over a new leaf, and is basically consistent), this is naturally reflected in art. Therefore, the screenwriter and director handle this contradiction without any stiff expression, which precisely embodies a new unity of art and politics.

　　Such themes are widely present in the internal struggles of the revolutionary people. These rich themes of internal struggles of the revolutionary people need to be reflected extensively in art. To deal with this kind of subject matter, one must deeply understand the life of the people, and it must be handled according to the revolutionary people's own consciousness. These farmers who have turned over a new leaf have begun to gain economic liberation. For example, Xiaoyong's mother already has her own land. Finally, she cleared her mind on the issue of mutual aid teams and resolved the difficulty of labor shortages. Coupled with the benefits actually gained from free marriage, she is no longer stubborn about the feudal marriage system. This shows that in the new society, the internal struggle of the people is mainly an ideological struggle. It can be completely resolved through the facts themselves and the educational method of self-criticism. We should affirm such real life and the art form that reflects it, which is of great educational significance to the broad masses of our people.

### 一种表现人民内部斗争的新艺术——评《两家春》

　　一种表现人民内部斗争的新艺术
    ——评《两家春》
    看过《钢铁意志》影片的人很多都称道它是一部好作品，因为它从两派人物的尖锐斗争中，表现了人民解放军英勇悲壮的战斗气氛，而《两家春》则是另外的一种情景，它出场的人物都是正派的人物，都是翻身后的善良农民，这中间也存在着严重的斗争，如这个影片所表现对婚姻问题的斗争，但是这种斗争只是这些人物中新旧思想的斗争，新旧制度的斗争。这中间并未穿插一个奸贼，也未穿插一个丑角，正因这样，就构成了一场颇为“和谐”的斗争，而成为表现新社会新人物的喜剧。剧情的调和正表现了艺术与政治的统一。只有在这翻身后的新农村，才有可能使旧社会所出演的无数悲剧而在今天变成喜剧。
    影片开头是一个结婚的场面。大刘庄的坠儿与小勇结婚，这件婚事是不合理的，女的坠儿二十岁了，而男的小勇则只九岁，形成这个婚姻的基本原因，主要是由于父母包办，但另外又参杂着一些过去的情义。本来坠儿与劳动模范大康有恋爱关系，两人都是好劳动，又以劳动关系结成姻缘。但是由于旧婚姻制度，她被父亲包办与小勇订了婚，他们这场亲事也是在患难中形成的，坠儿的父亲与小勇的父亲在封建官僚地主所造成的灾难中出去逃过荒，坠儿与小勇的妈也在灾荒中一同经历过患难生活，因此这就增加了坠儿父亲对这门亲事的执拗态度，总觉得不完成亲事，实在对不起死了的老友。坠儿本不情愿，一则固然由于自身的软弱，再则也因为老辈子的情义，不坚决对父亲反抗，而动摇了自己与大康结婚的决心。这个婚姻本身就是一个强力与感情复杂的结合。另外，本村干部对这事情的态度也是经过斗争的，但是村长终于以一种错误的观点把婚姻事件当做照顾翻身户解决生产力而加以同意了。当然，由于年龄的过于悬殊，这个矛盾是无论如何不能克服的，加上坠儿过门后又目睹本村一对“等郎媳”婚姻的不幸结局，烦恼丛生，终于成病，耽误生产。小勇在学校念书也遭到儿童们的讥笑，闹的不能上学，荒废功课，孩子也变得痴呆了。本来大家的好心，却造成一场痛苦，压在两家人的心坎上。最后经过村妇联会主任巧灵的解说，在新婚姻法的启发之下，两家都心甘情愿地同意坠儿与小勇离了婚，并完成大康与坠儿的婚事，不管在离婚与结婚两方面都是以喜剧告终。
    这个影片在许多地方都是以新人新观点来处理的，因而它就能把过去的悲剧变为今天的喜剧。如像大康对于小勇并不是以情敌的姿态出现的，大康因为认识到这是旧社会所遗留下的毒害，因而他对小勇始终是友好的，对两家父母也无什么怨恨，只是批评了坠儿的软弱。两家离婚时因为经过事实的教育而觉悟了，也都抱着一种和谐的态度：不是互相仇视，而是互相爱护。小勇的妈认坠儿做了干闺女，并叫小勇亲送衣物，村长对自己的错误也进行了自我批评。由于新社会中人民在政治上的和谐（因为大家都是翻身农民，在基本上是一致的），反映到艺术上也自然是这样，因而编导者在处理这种矛盾上毫无生硬的表现，这正体现出艺术与政治的一种新的统一。
    像这样的题材在革命人民的内部斗争中是广泛存在的。这种革命人民内部斗争的丰富题材，正需要在艺术上大量地加以反映。处理这种题材，必须深刻了解人民的生活，它必须根据革命人民自身的觉悟来处理。这些翻身农民在经济上已经开始获得解放，如小勇的妈既已有了自己的土地，最后又在互助组问题上打通了思想，解除了劳动力的困难，加上自由婚姻在事实上所得到的好处，使她不再固执那种封建的婚姻制度了，这说明了在新社会中人民内部的斗争，主要是一种思想斗争。它完全可以用事实本身及自我批评的教育方法来解决的。我们应该把这样的现实生活和作为它的反映的艺术形式肯定下来，这对于我国广大的人民是极有意义的教育。
