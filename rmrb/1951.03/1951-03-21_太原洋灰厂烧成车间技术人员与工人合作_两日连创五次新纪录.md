Taiyuan Cement Plant Calcination Workshop Technicians and Workers Cooperate
Two Days of Consecutive Creation of Five New Records

The technicians and workers of the No. 2 rotary kiln in the calcination workshop of Taiyuan Cement Plant studied together and created five new records in a row. After the No. 2 rotary kiln was repaired, it started production on March 2nd, but it failed to meet the quota for a week (the quota was 45.35 tons in eight hours), and the quality was not improved. Engineer Du Gong personally went to the kiln to check and found that the fire color in the kiln was not good. He called the workers together to study it. Everyone agreed that there was not enough wind and the chimney power was small. Du Gong suggested adding three doors to the three holes for discharging return material under the flue. In this way, natural ventilation would increase, the back pressure wind would decrease, and the opening and closing of the doors could also adjust the climate changes. The result of the implementation on the 11th was that a new record appeared that evening. Ren Wanfu's team created 52.8 tons. On the 12th, the first shift created 53.55 tons. The second shift, Niu Kejie, also created 51.81 tons in order to maintain the kiln lining. Then, in the evening, the third shift Ren Wanfu's team created 54 tons. On the 13th, the first shift created 55.6 tons. Five new records were created in two days. Previously, the No. 2 kiln produced a maximum of 140 tons per day for three shifts. Now, the three shifts add up to 159 tons and 360 kilograms, which is an unprecedented record for the factory, and the quality also meets the standards. The No. 2 rotary kiln is now applying kiln lining and maintaining the kiln, and can still guarantee a production of no less than 50 tons per shift. (Peng Yueming, Zhang Yonghe)

　　太原洋灰厂烧成车间技术人员与工人合作
    两日连创五次新纪录
    太原洋灰厂烧成车间二号回转窑技术人员与工人互相研究，连创五次新纪录。二号回转窑修好后，在三月二日开了窑，连续一周生产达不到定额（定额是八小时四五·三五吨），质量也提不高。工程师杜恭亲自到窑上检查，发现窑内火色情况不好，就召集工人一同研究，一致认为是风不足，烟囱力量小，杜恭建议在烟道下出回料的三个洞口加上三个门子，这样，自然通风增大，反扑风力减小，并且门子开闭还可调节气候的变化。十一日实行结果，当晚就出现了新纪录。任万富小组创了五二．八吨，十二日第一班又有一组创了五三．五五吨，第二班牛克杰为了养护窑挂窑皮，也创了五一．八一吨，接着晚上第三班任万福组又创了五四吨，十三日第一班又创了五五．六吨，两天创了五个新纪录。以前二号窑每日三个班加起来，最多是一百四十吨，现在三个班加起来是一百五十九吨三六○公斤，这是该厂史无前例的纪录，同时质量也合乎标准。现在二号回转窑正在挂窑皮，养护窑，还能保证每班生产不下五十吨。（彭月明，张永和）
