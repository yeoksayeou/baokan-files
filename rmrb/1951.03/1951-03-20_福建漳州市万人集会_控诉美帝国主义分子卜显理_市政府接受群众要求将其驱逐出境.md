　　Tens of Thousands Rally in Zhangzhou, Fujian
    Accusing American Imperialist Element Bu Xianli
    Municipal Government Accepts Public Demand to Deport Him
    On February 28th, people from all walks of life in Zhangzhou City held a rally to denounce the crimes of the American imperialist element Bu Xianli. Ten thousand people attended the meeting. Bu Xianli is a pastor of the American Reformed Church, currently serving as the trustee of Zhangzhou Xunyuan Middle School and the chairman of Zhangzhou Xiehe Hospital. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he colluded with the Japanese invaders as the head of the so-called "International Relief Society," using "relief for refugees" as a pretext to lure and capture able-bodied men to serve as cannon fodder for the Japanese invaders, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of young compatriots. Chen Shuimu, a worker at the Xiamen Chunquan Winery, personally witnessed Bu Xianli colluding with the Japanese invaders, seizing six patriotic compatriots from the refugee camp at one time. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Bu Xianli became even more hostile and opposed to the Chinese people. After the promulgation of the "Regulations on the Registration of Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Accepting Foreign Subsidies and Foreign Capital," he disregarded government decrees and secretly sold or moved part of the property of Xunyuan Middle School, which had accepted American capital, including refrigerators, radios, and gramophones, on December 31st of last year. He also rebuked Xunyuan Middle School students for participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, spreading rumors that "the Third World War is about to break out" to undermine the students' patriotic movement. Bu Xianli further actively opposed the Christian Reform Movement, unreasonably removing Chen Kairong, an elder of the Zhangdong Presbyterian Church who supported the Reform Movement, and recently unreasonably beat a worker at Xunyuan Middle School. At the rally, the masses were extremely indignant at Bu Xianli's crimes and unanimously demanded that he be deported. With the evidence at hand, Bu Xianli confessed to his crimes in public without denying them. The Zhangzhou Municipal People's Government then deported Bu Xianli on March 1st.

　　福建漳州市万人集会
    控诉美帝国主义分子卜显理
    市政府接受群众要求将其驱逐出境
    上月二十八日漳州市各界人民举行大会控诉美帝国主义分子卜显理的罪行，到会的有一万人。卜显理是美国归正教会牧师，现任漳州寻源中学校董、漳州协和医院董事长等职，在抗日战争期间，曾勾结日寇担任所谓“国际救济会”会长，以“救济难民”为名，诱骗和抓捕壮丁给日寇当炮灰，被害青年同胞达数百人。厦门醇泉酒厂工人陈水木曾亲眼看到卜显理勾结日寇，到难民所一次抓走爱国同胞六人。中华人民共和国成立以后，卜显理更加敌视和反对我国人民。在“接受外国津贴及外资经营之文化教育救济机关及宗教团体登记条例”颁布后，他竟不顾政府法令，于去年十二月三十一日将接受美资的寻源中学校产一部包括冰箱、收音机、留声机等物盗卖或搬走。他并斥骂寻源中学学生参加抗美援朝运动，散布“第三次世界大战就要爆发了”的谣言，以此破坏学生的爱国运动。卜显理更积极反对基督教革新运动，曾无理撤换了拥护革新运动的基督教漳东礼拜堂长老陈开荣，近又无理殴打寻源中学的工友。控诉会上群众对卜显理的罪行异常激愤，一致要求将其驱逐出境。卜显理以证据俱在，对自己的罪行当众承认不讳。漳州市人民政府遂于三月一日将卜显理驱逐出境。
