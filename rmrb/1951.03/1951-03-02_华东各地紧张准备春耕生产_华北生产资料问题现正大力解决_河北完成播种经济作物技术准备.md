	East China Vigorously Prepares for Spring Plowing
    North China Actively Addresses Production Material Issues
    Hebei Completes Technical Preparations for Sowing Cash Crops
    [Xinhua News Agency] Farmers in various parts of East China are busily engaged in various preparations for the major spring plowing production. This year, the application and accumulation of fertilizer in various regions is generally about double that of previous years. Farmers in Feixian County, Shandong Province, have universally fulfilled the requirement of "adding one more cart of manure." Farmers in the water network areas of Southern Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu, in addition to collecting manure, buying manure, and buying bean cake, are also organizing boats to dredge river mud and carry pond mud to solve the fertilizer shortage. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Fujian Provincial People's Government has established seven animal disease prevention stations throughout the province and dispatched thirty animal disease prevention teams to carry out immunization injections for draft cattle for the masses. Land reform areas’ emancipated farmers adding draft animals and repairing farm tools is also quite common. After the conclusion of land reform in Xie Gou District, Pingnan County (newly established county, southern Pingdu), Shandong Province, farmers purchased more than 1,100 head of draft animals. Yu Dexing, a poor peasant in Wulong Township, Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu, bought two rakes, a shovel, and saved money from the New Year to buy a draft cattle. Farmers in Rudong County (newly established county, eastern Rugao), Northern Jiangsu, have newly built more than 3,500 waterwheels. Farmers in the coastal areas of southern Fujian have repaired 156 miles of seawall. Twenty-eight counties in Fujian Province, such as Minhou and Nanping, have built more than 1,000 canals and dams, benefiting a total of more than 210,000 mu of farmland.

	In the disaster area of ​​northern Anhui, many disaster victims used the surplus from sideline production to purchase a large number of livestock and farm tools. The Anhui North People's Administrative Office has also prepared more than 20 million catties of grain seeds, 20,000 iron hoes, and more than 8,000 plows, which will be loaned to disaster victims with a focus.

	Before the spring plowing, the East China Military and Political Committee successively issued the "Instructions on Agricultural Production Work for This Year," the "Agricultural Production Plan," and the "Ten Policies for Developing Agricultural Production," calling on all regions to consolidate last year's bumper harvest level and strive to increase production this year. To this end, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the East China Military and Political Committee decided to issue a large number of loans this year to help poor farmers solve production difficulties. Cooperatives in various regions have also prepared a large amount of fertilizer to supply the needs of farmer members. Various provinces have also held labor model conferences and agricultural cadre conferences to convey production policies and plans, and exchange production experiences, which has further enhanced the confidence of cadres and farmers in completing this year's production tasks.

	[Xinhua News Agency] In order to welcome the upcoming spring plowing production, local people's governments and cooperative and state-owned specialized companies at all levels in North China are vigorously solving the problem of production materials such as farm tools and fertilizers, which farmers urgently need.

	After the bumper harvest last year, farmers in North China not only increased the number of agricultural products sold externally, but also, due to the increased purchasing power, the quantity of consumer and producer goods that need to be purchased is unprecedented in the past several decades. In the winter material exchange, although some supply problems have been solved in various ways (such as signing contracts, etc.), most of them belong to consumer goods, and the solution to production materials is still far from meeting the needs of farmers. For example, farmers in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, will purchase five or six hundred carts and three or four hundred waterwheels this year, and will also purchase new-style farm tools such as water pumps, sprayers, and chaff cutters. Other small farm tools also need to be added and repaired urgently.

	In response to this situation, local people's governments and state-owned specialized companies, cooperatives, and other economic and trade departments are vigorously solving this problem for farmers in various ways. Under the leadership of the government and supply and marketing cooperatives, counties in Chahar Province and Anyang Prefecture of Pingyuan Province held agricultural tool conferences or handicraft representative conferences in January. The conferences focused on solving the problems of planning and specifications for the production and sales of agricultural tools, so that those who need them can find sellers, and producers can find reliable customers. At the agricultural tool conference in Chahar Province, farmers from various places signed contracts with agricultural tool producers, including more than 20,000 large and small agricultural tools. The handicraft representative conferences in various counties of Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, generally implemented the principle of determining production based on sales and signed many production and sales contracts. At the handicraft representative conference in Qi County alone, nine contracts and thirty-five agreements were signed.

	The supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned economic departments of Shanxi and Hebei provinces are striving to solve the problem of rural production materials according to the needs of farmers in their respective regions, either by purchasing from distant places or by finding ways to exchange. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased 2.7 million catties of fertilizing powder and 50,000 catties of red alum, and plans to distribute them to 164,000 members throughout the province at prices 6% to 12% lower than the market price before the spring plowing. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Hebei Province have prepared 778,000 various farm tools, 4.59 million catties of various seeds, and 10,000 catties of pesticides for use in spring plowing production by members. At the same time, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is transporting the local cloth produced by members throughout the province to Chahar and Suiyuan, preparing to exchange for more than 4,000 head of livestock.

	In addition, various parts of North China are also leading members to widely launch a campaign to exchange for fertilizer and repair farm tools, with the cooperative grassroots societies as the center. For example, members of the cooperatives in eight villages in the Sixth District of Tangyin County, Pingyuan Province, transported more than 269,000 catties of sweet potatoes and cabbage to Anyang City in exchange for more than 240,000 catties of manure; Jingtou Village, Lin County, organized forty blacksmith furnaces and more than 120 craftsmen to continuously repair and manufacture farm tools with the support of the village supply and marketing cooperative. The Nanyu Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the county supplied the village's blacksmiths and carpenters with raw materials and food, and repaired 1,250 farm tools in 30 days. 276 village cooperatives in 13 counties in Shanxi Province, such as Licheng, Fangshan, and Kelan, have repaired and installed more than 79,360 various farm tools. 260 village cooperatives in 18 counties such as Jing Le have organized 1,754 oil mills, and have extracted nearly 400,000 catties of oil, accumulating a total of more than 1.07 million catties of oil cakes.

	[Xinhua News Agency] Hebei Province's technical preparations for sowing cash crops such as cotton and peanuts have been completed. This provides favorable conditions for the province to complete the sowing and increase the production of cash crops this year. The province has achieved remarkable results in training technical personnel and promoting agricultural technology. As of now, the province has trained more than 1,500 county and district agricultural technical cadres, and formed roving training groups with them as the center to train production activists such as rural labor models and technical team leaders by district. More than 90,000 people have been trained, with an average of two to three people in each village having received technical training. At the same time, agricultural technology publicity work has also been carried out in various places. The Provincial People's Government and various special commissioner's offices have printed 1 million copies of 8 kinds of posters and leaflets for publicizing and teaching agricultural technology. Various places have also organized roving agricultural exhibitions and labor model conferences to exchange farming technical experience in a timely manner. The villages in Baoding Prefecture also use the personnel who have received technical training as winter school teachers to teach agricultural technology to farmers.

	The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture has formulated this year's agricultural technology promotion plan, requiring the province to promote good cotton seeds on 2.4 million mu this year, promote good varieties of millet and wheat on 2.47 million mu, and strive to prevent and control cotton aphids, mole crickets, locusts, armyworms, etc. in a timely manner so that insect pests will not become a disaster. To this end, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has allocated and sold 35,000 sprayers, 2,000 powder sprayers, and a large number of pesticides purchased to farmers. The ten good cotton guidance areas in the province have prepared more than 15 million catties of good cotton seeds and started selling or exchanging them to farmers. The good cotton guidance area in Tianjin Prefecture has sent personnel to various counties to inspect the preparations of farmers' good cotton seeds, and cooperated with the people's governments of various counties and districts to hold mass competitions for self-retained good seeds, rewarding farmers who selected and stored good cotton seeds, and encouraged the masses to exchange good seeds. The agricultural technology promotion stations in various counties also rely on labor models, technical team leaders, and old farmers in rural areas to focus on rectifying and developing agricultural technology groups and establish mass disease and pest prevention and control stations.

　　华东各地紧张准备春耕生产
    华北生产资料问题现正大力解决
    河北完成播种经济作物技术准备
    【新华社讯】华东区各地农民正在紧张地进行春耕大生产的各项准备工作。今年各地春耕准备中，施肥积肥一般都较往年增加一倍左右。山东费县农民已普遍完成“多上一车粪”的要求。苏南、苏北等水网地区农民除拾粪、买粪、买豆饼外，并组织船只挖河泥、挑塘泥，解决肥料困难。此外，福建省人民政府农林厅在全省设立了七个兽疫防治站，派出三十个兽疫防治队，为群众进行耕牛防疫注射。业已完成土地改革地区的翻身农民添买耕畜、增修农具也相当普遍。山东省平南县（新设县、平度南部）斜沟区在结束土地改革以后，农民购买耕畜一千一百余头。苏南松江县五龙乡贫农俞得兴买了两把钉耙、一把铲，还省下过年花的钱买了一条耕牛。苏北如东县（新设县、如皋东部）农民新修水车三千五百多部。福建南部沿海农民修补了长达一百五十六里的海堤，该省闽侯、南平等二十八县已修筑水渠、水坝一千余处，受益农田共二十一万余亩。
    在皖北灾区，许多灾民把副业生产的盈余购买了大批牲口、农具。皖北人民行政公署并准备了二千余万斤粮种、两万把铁铣、八千余件犁，将有重点地贷放给灾民。
    在春耕以前，华东军政委员会曾先后发布了今年农业生产工作指示、农业生产计划及发展农业生产十大政策的布告，号召各地巩固去年的丰收水平，力求今年增加产量。为此，华东军政委员会农林部决定今年发放大批贷款，帮助贫苦农民解决生产困难。各地合作社也准备了大量的肥料供应农民社员需要。各省并分别召开了劳动模范会议、农业干部会议等，传达了生产政策、计划和交流了生产经验，更加提高了干部和农民完成今年生产任务的信心。
    【新华社讯】为迎接即将到来的春耕生产，华北各地人民政府及各级合作社、国营专业公司等正大力解决农民所迫切需要的农具、肥料等生产资料问题。
    华北农民在去年丰收后，不仅向外推销的农产品增多，而且由于购买力提高，需要购进的生活与生产资料，其数量之大，亦为十数年来所未有。在冬季物资交流中，虽以各种方式（如订合同等）解决了一部分供应问题，但多属于生活资料方面的东西，而生产资料的解决，还距农民的需要甚远。如平原省林县农民今年就要购买五、六百辆大车，三、四百辆水车，并要购买抽水机、喷雾器、铡草机等新式农具。其他小农具也急需增添和修理。
    根据这一情况，各地人民政府及国营专业公司、合作社等经济贸易部门，便以各种办法大力为农民解决这一问题。察哈尔省及平原省的安阳专区各县，在政府及供销合作社领导下，均于一月间召开了农具会议或手工业代表会。会议上着重解决了农具产销的计划性和规格问题，使需要者得到卖主，生产者找到可靠顾客。在察哈尔省农具会议上，各地农民与农具生产者订立了合同，包括大小农具两万多件。平原省安阳专区各县的手工业代表会议，一般都贯彻了以销定产的方针，订立了很多产销合同。仅淇县一县的手工业代表会上，就签订九件合同，三十五个协议。
    山西、河北两省的供销合作社及国营经济部门，正根据各该地农民的需要，或从远地购买，或设法交换，力求解决农村生产资料问题。如山西省供销合作社已购得二百七十万斤肥田粉，五万斤红矾，准备于春耕前以低于市价百分之六至十二的价格，配售给全省十六万四千个社员。河北省各级供销合作社，已准备好了各种农具七十七万八千件，各种籽种四百五十九万斤，农药一万斤，供给社员春耕生产之用。同时，省供销合作社正以全省社员生产的土布，运往察哈尔、绥远，准备换取牲口四千余头。
    此外，华北各地更以合作社基层社为中心，领导社员广泛展开了换买肥料和修造农具的运动。如平原省汤阴县第六区八个村庄的合作社社员，将剩余的二十六万九千多斤红薯、白菜运往安阳市，换回大粪二十四万多斤；林县井头村，在村供销合作社扶助下，组织了四十盘铁匠炉一百二十多个工匠，天天不停地修理、制造农具。该县南峪村供销合作社供给本村铁、木匠原料和食粮，三十天增修农具一千二百五十件。山西省的黎城、方山、岢岚等十三县二百七十六个村合作社，已修置了各种农具七万九千三百六十多件。静乐等十八县二百六十个村合作社，组织了一千七百五十四座油坊，榨油已近四十万斤，共积油饼一百零七万多斤。
    【新华社讯】河北省播种棉花、花生等经济作物的技术准备工作业已就绪。对于今年全省完成经济作物的播种和增产提供了有利的条件。该省在训练技术人员和宣传农业技术工作方面成绩显著。截至目前为止，全省已训练县、区农业技术干部达一千五百余人，并以他们为中心组成巡回训练小组，以区为单位分别训练农村劳动模范和技术组长等生产积极分子。现已训练九万多人，每村平均已有二人至三人受过技术训练。同时，各地还进行了农业技术宣传工作。该省人民政府和各专署已印发了八种共一百万份的宣传与讲授农业技术的挂图和传单。各地并组织了巡回农业展览会、劳动模范大会，及时交流了耕作技术经验。保定专区各村更将已受过技术训练的人员，作为冬学教员，向农民传授农业技术。
    河北省农业厅已制定了今年农业技术推广计划，要求全省今年推广优良棉种达二百四十万亩，推广谷、麦优良品种二百四十七万亩，争取及时防治棉蚜、蝼蛄、蝗虫、粘虫等，使虫害不致成灾。为此，省府农业厅已将购妥的三万五千架喷雾器、二千架喷粉器和大批农药，配售给农民。该省十个良棉指导区已备妥优良棉种一千五百余万斤，开始向农民出售或交换。天津专区的良棉指导区已派员分赴各县检查农民优良棉种准备情形，并配合各县、区人民政府召开群众自留良种比赛大会，奖励选存优良棉种的农户，鼓励了群众互换良种。各县的农业技术推广场并依靠农村中的劳动模范、技术组长和老农，有重点地整顿和发展农业技术小组，建立了群众性的病虫害防除站。
