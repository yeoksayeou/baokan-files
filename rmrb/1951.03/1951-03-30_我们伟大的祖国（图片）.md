Our Great Motherland

One of the fundamental principles of the people's education in new China is opening the doors of education to workers and peasants. This is a scene of students at the Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School reading newspapers and books after class. The majority of the students here are combat heroes, labor heroes, and model workers from various military units, factories, and rural areas.
