Studying Theory is a Process of Ideological Awakening
    Qian Yu

    "We are now in an extremely complex period, and our country's life is becoming more complex year by year." Therefore, "it is now extremely difficult to treat various social phenomena with a primitive and crude attitude." Therefore, our cadres "must have great Marxist preparation in advance." (Kalinin, On Communist Education, page 17) This is what Comrade Kalinin said to the graduates of Sverdlov University on May 30, 1926. This is an extremely important instruction. Undoubtedly, this instruction is of great significance to us who are engaged in revolutionary work in China today. Every comrade should first ask himself: Do you have a keen sense of the fresh things that are developing in society? Do you treat your work with a "primitive and crude attitude"? Do you have Marxist theoretical preparation? Every comrade should use Kalinin's words to awaken his awareness of studying Marxism, thereby improving his thinking and improving his work. However, having a theoretical awareness of studying Marxism is an arduous process of ideological awakening. Regarding this point, I have extremely painful experiences in my past work experience.

    Before joining the party, I lacked proletarian consciousness and understanding of revolutionary theory. After joining the party, I did not solve this problem for a long time. All work, all struggles, relied only on the enthusiasm and courage of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries, not on science, wisdom, or Marxist-Leninist theory, to study the overall situation and development laws of things in order to correctly apply strategies. This is the basic reason why I sometimes won and sometimes lost, lost more and won less, did stupid things, and made mistakes in my past work in the White areas.

    After the War of Resistance Against Japan, I had more work experience and heavier work responsibilities, but I still lacked theoretical preparation. At this time, it is no exaggeration to say that I was issuing orders based on my work position and handling affairs based on experience. Therefore, I often lost my way at major historical junctures, and consequently, I made many mistakes. I was also distressed and doubted about this: Is it because I am not loyal to the party? Is it because I lack the determination to serve the people to the end? Is it because I do not take the meetings convened by the higher authorities seriously enough, and I do not study the party's instructions and documents carefully enough? Is it because my mass viewpoint is weak and I have not personally gone to the countryside to investigate and study? I thought about this over and over again, and I always thought that I was subjectively loyal to the party, determined to serve the people to the end, attached importance to the meetings convened by the higher authorities, and studied the party's instructions and documents carefully, and I had also personally inspected work and conducted investigations and studies. However, the work was rarely done well, the party's tasks were not well completed, I did not serve the people well, but served the people very badly, and the objective facts were often contrary to my subjective hopes. What is the reason for this? So I studied, reflected, and pondered. Finally, I discovered this truth: In addition to my poor party spirit and insufficient mass viewpoint, the serious lack of theoretical preparation over the years is one of the basic reasons why the work is not done well and progress is not fast enough.

    Every time after self-examination, I often wanted to study theory, but because this understanding was still one-sided and intuitive, lacking a solid foundation, I never seriously studied it in my work. It was not until I entered school to study theory specifically that I had a relatively deep understanding and understanding of the reasons for past mistakes and the importance of theory in the actual learning process. This is exactly what Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "We cannot immediately understand what we feel, and only what we understand can we feel more deeply."

    In my studies, I deeply felt that the enthusiasm of my youth was flawed. It was a kind of petty-bourgeois enthusiasm that had not been transformed. That kind of enthusiasm was impatient, boastful, arrogant, and a manifestation of left-wing infantile disease. It was enthusiastic adventurism. This kind of enthusiasm is completely contrary to the proletariat's composure, perseverance, calmness, honesty, and the spirit of seeking truth from facts. As a revolutionary, it is not enough to have enthusiasm. He needs a clear mind and a pragmatic spirit. Revolution is not a joke, but a serious class struggle, so it is not only necessary to rely on enthusiasm, but also on science - the science of Marxism-Leninism.

    At this time, I also began to have a new understanding of my past so-called experience. Yes, experience is valuable. Experience created from practice - whether successful or failed - is valuable. However, this kind of experience must be treated independently and critically. "It is necessary to transform and create the rich sensory material through the role of thinking, to eliminate the crude and select the fine, to eliminate the false and retain the true, to proceed from one to the other, and to proceed from the outside to the inside, to create a system of concepts and theories, and it is necessary to leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge" ("On Practice"). Only in this way can we avoid making the mistake of empiricism because we have experience, and can we avoid being satisfied with "the merit of one gain and the view of one hole" and "being complacent." Only in this way is experience truly valuable, and can we avoid applying it indiscriminately regardless of time, place, and conditions, so that experience not only does not become a work assistant, but also becomes a stumbling block to our progress. But my past attitude towards experience was not like this. Many experiences were still limited to fragmentary and partial perceptual knowledge, and were not generalized and elevated to rationality, so errors often occurred when applying experience.

    It was precisely because of the above two mistakes that my past work became like this: that is, whenever the correct grasp of the superior leadership was relatively tight, and I was relatively modest, paid more attention to learning, and was closer to the masses, and was able to correctly reflect the opinions of the masses, then the work could still achieve results, and generally could complete the party's tasks; conversely, when the superior was far away, and it was also catching up with a major historical turning point, or when my thinking became arrogant, high above, did not like to learn, and was divorced from the masses, then I often made mistakes. -- This has almost become a law. This law precisely illustrates that a person without revolutionary theory can only rely on the control of the superior to handle affairs, and he completely loses the ability and creativity of independent work that a Bolshevik should have.

    From this, it can be seen that in order to do a good job and make fewer or no mistakes, it is necessary to resolutely study theory. Recognizing the importance of Marxist-Leninist theory and striving to study it is indeed a process of ideological awakening. According to my experience, it goes from blind arrogance to encountering obstacles in work, and from encountering obstacles in work to resolutely studying theory. In the past two years of theoretical study, I have begun to understand a little about the importance of studying Marxist-Leninist theory. However, this cannot be called a deep understanding; a truly deep understanding is only possible when we return to the rich revolutionary practice, only from studying theory to applying theory, and transforming theory into a material force.

    As everyone knows, our Chinese Communist Party has always had revolutionary theory from the highest leading organ of the party. This can be eloquently explained in the works of the outstanding representative of Chinese Marxism - Comrade Mao Zedong. It is precisely because the Chinese revolution was guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolution, that it has achieved a huge victory that has shaken the world and reversed the direction of Chinese and Eastern history, just like the Soviet October Revolution.

    It is not difficult to understand that this victory is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, the victory of the Chineseization of Marxism-Leninism - Mao Zedong Thought. But despite this, the necessity of studying Marxism-Leninism has not yet been understood by every comrade. Many people still think that Marxism-Leninism is something that can be learned or not, and they often resist theoretical study with various excuses, either self-important, thinking that they have "enough" theory, or self-deprecating, afraid of studying theory. Therefore, although they are subjectively loyal to the party and have considerable experience, the result of their work cannot but be contrary to their wishes.

    As Chairman Mao said in his discussion of study at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee in October 1938: "Our work has been done quite well, but if we do not deepen our study of theory, we will not be able to do our work better, and only if our work is done better can we have our victory. Therefore, studying theory is the condition for victory. From the point of view of the main leading responsibility, if China has one hundred to two hundred comrades who have systematically, not piecemeal, practically, not empty, learned Marxism, it will be tantamount to overthrowing a Japanese imperialism. Comrades, we must study Marxism."

    It is not difficult to understand that Chairman Mao's valuable instructions have even greater, newer, and more realistic significance in the new period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, defending the country, and the country's entry into complex and arduous construction in various fields. Every comrade must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Comrades, we must study Marxism."

### 学习理论是一个思想觉悟过程

　　学习理论是一个思想觉悟过程
    茜予
    “现今我们是处在一个极复杂的时期，我国的生活一年比一年更加复杂起来。”因此，“目前要用原始粗率态度去对待各种社会现象，已经是极难做到了。”所以我们的干部“事先就要有极大的马克思主义准备”。（加里宁，论共产主义教育，十七页）这是加里宁同志在一九二六年五月三十日对斯维尔德洛夫大学毕业生讲的话，这是一个极为重要的指示。无疑的，这一指示对于今天在中国从事革命工作的我们来说，同样有着非常重大的意义。每一个同志都应当首先问问自己：是否对社会上正在发展着的新鲜事物具有锐敏的感觉？是否用“原始粗率态度”去对待工作？自己是否具有马克思主义的理论准备；每个同志都应该用加里宁的话以唤起自己学习马克思主义的觉悟，从而提高思想，改进工作。然而，具有学习马克思主义的理论觉悟，却是一个艰苦的思想觉悟过程。关于这一点，在我过去的工作经历当中，有着极为痛苦的经验。
    我在入党以前，是缺乏无产阶级的觉悟与对革命理论的认识的，入党以后，又长期没有解决这个问题。一切工作，一切斗争，只是依靠小资产阶级革命家的热情与勇敢，不是靠科学，靠智慧，靠马克思列宁主义理论，去研究事物的全面情况与发展规律，以正确地应用策略。这就是我在过去白区工作中，时胜时败，败多胜少，干蠢事，犯错误的基本原因。
    抗战以后，工作经验比较地多起来了，工作责任也更加重了，可是依然缺乏理论准备。这时，毫不夸张地说，是靠工作地位来发号施令，是靠经验来办事的。所以每当重大历史关节，常易迷失方向，因而，又曾犯过不少的错误。我为此也曾经苦闷过，怀疑过：难道是对党不忠实吗？难道是缺少对人民服务到底的决心吗？难道是对上级所召开的会议不够严肃对待、对党的指示和文件没有用心去研究吗？难道是因为群众观点薄弱，没有亲身下乡去调查研究吗？我曾为此反来覆去，想过再四，总以为我主观上还是对党忠实的，有为人民服务到底的决心的，是重视上级所召开的会议，并用心研究过党的指示和文件的，而且还是亲身巡视工作与调查研究过的。然而工作竟很少做好，党的任务竟没有很好地完成，不是为人民服务得很好，而是为人民服务得很坏，客观事实常与自己的主观希望相反。这是什么原因呢？于是我研究、反省、揣摩。最后终于发现了这个真理，除了我的党性较差，群众观念不足之外，多年来严重地缺乏理论准备，实是工作做不好，进步不够快的基本原因之一。
    每当自我检讨之后，我也常常想学习理论，但由于这种认识还是片面的、直感的，缺乏巩固的基础的，所以在工作中，始终并不曾认真地学习过。直到进入学校专门学习理论以后，在实际的学习过程中，才对过去错误的原因与理论的重要性，有了比较深刻的认识与理解。这正像毛主席在《实践论》上所说的：“感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。”
    在学习中，我深感过去年轻时候的热情是有缺陷的，那是一种未经过改造的小资产阶级的热情。那种热情是性急、浮夸、狂妄、是一种左倾幼稚病的表现，是热情的冒险。这种热情恰是同无产阶级的沉着、坚毅、冷静，老老实实与实事求是的精神，完全背道而驰的。作为一个革命家，仅有热情是不够的，他更需要明皙的头脑与求实主义的精神。革命不是开玩笑，而是严重的阶级斗争，那就不单要靠热情，而更要靠科学——马克思、列宁主义的科学。
    这时，对自己过去的所谓经验，也开始有了一个新的认识。不错，经验是可宝贵的，从实际中创造出来的经验——不管是成功的或失败的经验，这些都是有价值的。然而对于这种经验，必须独立地批判地去对待。“必须经过思考作用，将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念及理论的系统，就必须从感性认识跃进到理性认识”（《实践论》）。唯有如此，才不致因为有了经验，而又犯经验主义的错误，才不致满足于“一得之功与一孔之见”而“沾沾自喜”。唯其如此，经验才是真正可贵的，才不致不管时间、地点、条件而到处去胡乱搬用，使经验不仅没有成为自己的工作助力，反而成为自己前进的绊脚石。但我过去对待经验的态度并不是如此的，许多经验仍只限于片断的局部的感性认识，没有概括上升到理性，因而在运用经验时不免时常发生错误。
    正因为上述两种错误，所以我过去的工作便成了这个样子：即每当上级领导正确抓得较紧，而自己又比较虚心比较注意学习，比较接近群众，能够正确反映群众意见时，则工作还能作出成绩，一般的能够完成党的任务；反之，上级离的较远，而又是赶上重大的历史转变关头，或是自己思想上发生了骄气，高高在上，不爱学习，脱离群众时，则常常犯错误。——这几乎成了一种规律。这种规律正说明一个没有革命理论的人，他只能靠上级的掌握来办事，他完全失掉了布尔什维克应具有的独立工作的能力和创造性。
    由此可见，要做好工作，使工作不犯或少犯错误，就非痛下决心学习理论不可。认识到马克思列宁主义理论的重要性，从而努力学习它，实在是一个思想觉悟过程。根据我的经验，它是由盲目自大到工作碰壁，由工作碰壁再到决心学习理论。在这两年余的理论学习中，我开始懂得了一点学习马克思列宁主义理论的重要性了。然而这还不能叫做深刻懂得；真正深刻懂得，只有再到丰富的革命实践中，只有从学习理论到运用理论，把理论化成为物质力量时，才有可能。
    大家知道，我们中国共产党从党的最高领导机关说来向来就是具有革命的理论的，这可从中国马克思主义的杰出代表——毛泽东同志的著作中，得到雄辩的说明。也正是因为中国革命是在马克思列宁主义与中国革命相结合的伟大的毛泽东思想指导之下，才取得了震动世界扭转中国和东方历史方向，如同苏联十月革命一样的巨大胜利。
    不难了解，这一胜利是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，是马克思列宁主义中国化——毛泽东思想的胜利。但尽管如此，对学习马克思列宁主义的必要性，还并不是已为每一个同志所理解。有不少的人，还认为马克思列宁主义是可学可不学的东西，他们常以种种借口抵抗理论学习，或者自高，自以为理论“够了”，或者自卑，害怕学习理论，因此，他们虽然在主观上对党忠诚，经验也相当丰富，然而工作的结果，就不能不事与愿违。
    正如毛主席一九三八年十月在党中央六中全会上论学习一段所说的：“我们的工作做得还不错，但如果不加深一步地学习理论，就无法使我们的工作做得更好一些，而只有我们的工作做得更好一些，才有我们的胜利。因此，学习理论是胜利的条件。在主要领导责任的观点上说，如果中国有一百个至二百个系统地而不是零碎地，实际地而不是空洞地，学会了马克思主义的同志，那将是等于打倒一个日本帝国主义。同志们，我们要一定学习马克思主义。”
    不难了解，毛主席这一宝贵指示，在目前抗美援朝保家卫国与国家进入复杂而艰巨的各项建设的新时期，是更有着如何巨大的崭新的现实的意义。每个同志都必须按照毛主席的指示：“同志们，我们要一定学习马克思主义”。
