　　Since January of this year, strengthening patriotic education among the people has become a common theme in newspapers across the country, and newspaper workers have made achievements in this area.

　　One of the methods currently adopted by newspapers to promote patriotism is to add small columns aimed at arousing patriotism. Following this newspaper's "Our Great Motherland" and the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's "China's World Firsts" columns, many newspapers across the country have opened similar columns; especially smaller, popular newspapers, which have adopted this approach even more. Facts have proven that these small columns are welcomed by readers.

　　Some newspapers have made meaningful attempts when adding these small columns. After "China's World Firsts," Shanghai Ta Kung Pao opened a small column in the economic news section on February 20th, introducing "China's Local Specialties," breaking the narrowness of the "World Firsts" theme. Hebei Daily opened a non-fixed column on the right side of the newspaper header from February 1st, introducing our motherland from all aspects. The column started with titles such as "The Great Chinese People Have Stood Up" and "The Glorious and Great Chinese Nation." However, due to the lack of a general title and illustrations, it does not appear very eye-catching. Shandong Rural Mass Daily opened a small column "Great Motherland" on the third page from January 17th, and published an editorial on the first day of publishing this small column, entitled "The Content and Requirements of 'Love the Motherland'." From the more than ten issues we have received, the content of the small column includes the following parts: January 17th to 27th introducing the general situation of our country, January 29th to February 3rd introducing the great creations of our people in history, and after February 11th focusing on promoting the tradition of our people's revolutionary struggle; the latter part includes titles such as: "Glorious Revolutionary Tradition," "Patriotic Heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "May Fourth Patriotic Movement," "25,000-Li Long March," "July 7th Resistance War," etc. The column of Shanxi Peasant Daily is titled "I Love Our Great Motherland, Our Motherland is Number One in the World," and the text takes the form of doggerel; the column "Our Great Motherland" of Wuxi Workers' Life Daily also uses the form of clapper talk. These are all in line with the requirements of workers and peasants. However, the titles of Shanxi Peasant Daily are all one-sided – we are indeed "world first" in many aspects, but it is incorrect to say generally that "it is number one in the world."

　　However, not all of these small columns have their own unique content or have made creative attempts; more of these small columns are just reprints and imitations of this newspaper's "Our Great Motherland" or Ta Kung Pao's "China's World Firsts." Fuxin Miner's Daily reprinted a replica of "Our Great Motherland," and because it completely used the original newspaper's copied copperplate, the printing was very unclear, weakening the publicity effect. What is particularly noteworthy is the terrible negligence of the Lushun-Dalian People's Daily, which reprinted "Our Great Motherland" word for word. Thus, the picture and text commemorating "February 7th" were published in the newspaper on February 17th, but the description was still "Today, twenty-eight years ago...". The second anniversary of the liberation of Tianjin was also mistaken from January 15th to January 17th. Such negligence should not have happened at all.

　　The lack of creative attempts and original reprints has caused a serious generalization phenomenon in these small columns. Everywhere are common records such as the invention of the compass, gunpowder, and printing, without really trying to explore more materials that actually exist everywhere, especially without linking them to local scenery and people's lives. For example, Mr. Liang Sicheng mentioned in his article "Our Great Architectural Tradition and Heritage" that the Zhao Zhou Bridge in Zhao County, Hebei, is a great creation in ancient Chinese architectural engineering and was "world first" in history, but the Hebei Daily did not use this material. For example, Shandong Rural Mass Daily also introduced the Great Wall and the Grand Canal in "Great Motherland," but did not pay attention to linking it with the actual local life, appropriately explaining the impact of the Grand Canal running through western Shandong on Shandong's history, culture, and economy, and publishing a photo showing the situation on both sides of the Grand Canal in Shandong. However, this type of material can be found in many places and does not require experts to put forward. If the newspaper pays attention to collecting from the masses in various ways, it can obtain many such materials from various written records and local elders who are familiar with local anecdotes, cultural relics, and historical sites. After careful research and selection by the editorial department, the most reliable and practically significant parts can be used as the content of this column, which will surely overcome the shortcomings of this column's generalization to a large extent.

　　Only when newspapers combine patriotic education with the specific feelings of the local people, only by using the sharp contrast with the Kuomintang reactionary rule to publicize loving one's own city, one's own region, and the current good life, and by linking every new change and new development in local life and work to loving the motherland and loving our cause with a bright future, can we constantly improve the patriotic feelings of the people. Only such propaganda is ideological.

　　The efforts made by Nanjing Xinhua Daily in this regard are worth promoting. In February, the newspaper twice published pictures about publicizing loving the motherland in the space of half a page of a pictorial, and one of the times on February 5th was an introduction about Nanjing with the theme of "People's Nanjing, Beautiful Rivers and Mountains." This is just a tentative effort, and perhaps not very planned. However, this is precisely the direction that the patriotic columns of various newspapers should strive for.

　　Carrying out patriotic propaganda and education is a regular and important task of the newspaper. The small column of patriotic propaganda has been welcomed by readers, proving that it is one of the forms worth continuing to adopt. However, overcoming the generalization trend of this column still depends on the diligent efforts of newspaper workers in various places.

### 谈宣传爱国主义的小专栏

专栏：报纸述评

　　谈宣传爱国主义的小专栏
    从今年一月开始，加强对人民群众的爱国主义教育在全国各地的报纸上成了共同的主题，报纸工作者在这一方面的努力是有成绩的。
    目前各报所采取的宣传爱国主义的方法之一，是增加一种以唤起爱国主义为目的的小专栏。继本报《我们伟大的祖国》和上海大公报的《中国的世界第一》两个专栏之后，全国各地有许多报纸已辟了同样性质的专栏；尤其是小型的通俗报纸，采用这种方式的更多。事实证明，这样的小专栏是为读者所欢迎的。
    有些报纸在增辟这种小专栏时作了有意义的尝试。上海大公报继“中国的世界第一”之后，二月二十日又在经济新闻版中辟了一个小专栏，介绍“中国的土特产”，打破了“世界第一”的主题的狭隘性。河北日报从二月一日起在报头右方辟了不固定的专栏，从各方面介绍我们的祖国，专栏是从《伟大的中国人民已经站起来了》，《光荣伟大的中华民族》等题目开始的。但是，由于没有总题和插图，因此显得不很夺目。山东农村大众报从一月十七日开始在第三版辟了小专栏《伟大的祖国》，并在刊载这个小专栏的第一天，发表了社论“‘爱祖国’的内容和要求”。从我们已收到的十几期中看，小专栏的内容包括以下几部分：一月十七日到二十七日介绍我国的一般情况，一月二十九日到二月三日介绍历史上我国人民的伟大创造，二月十一日以后着重宣传我国人民革命斗争的传统；在后一部分中包括这样的题目：《光荣的革命传统》，《太平天国的爱国英雄》，《五四爱国运动》，《二万五千里长征》，《七七抗战》等。山西农民报的专栏题为《我爱我们的伟大祖国，祖国在世界上数第一》，文字采取了顺口溜的形式；无锡工人生活报的专栏《我们伟大的祖国》也采用快板形式。这些都是适合工农群众的要求的。但是山西农民报的题目都带有片面性——我们在有许多方面确是“世界第一”的，笼统地说“在世界上数第一”可就是不正确的了。
    但是，并不是所有这些小专栏都是有自己特具的内容，或作了创造性的尝试的；更多的这样的小专栏只是本报《我们伟大的祖国》或大公报《中国的世界第一》的转载和翻版。阜新矿工报转载了《我们伟大的祖国》的翻版，由于完全用原报复制铜版，因而印刷出来很不清晰，削弱了宣传效果。尤其值得注意的是旅大人民日报的可怕的疏忽，该报一字不改地转载了《我们伟大的祖国》，于是纪念“二七”的图文发表在二月十七日的报上，说明中却还是“二十八年前的今天……”。天津解放两周年也由一月十五日错成一月十七日了。这样的疏忽是完全不应该有的。
    缺少创造性的尝试和原文转载，造成了这种小专栏的严重的一般化现象，到处是关于指南针、火药、印刷术的发明这一类常见的记载，没有真正用力去发掘实际上到处都存在的更多的材料，特别是没有与当地的地方风光和人民生活联系起来。比如梁思成先生在《我国伟大的建筑传统与遗产》一文中提出的河北赵县的赵州桥，是我国古代建筑工程上的伟大创造，在历史上是“世界第一”的，但这个材料河北日报就没有加以利用。又如山东农村大众报在《伟大的祖国》中也介绍了长城和运河，但就没有注意与地方生活的实际联系起来，适当地说明一下纵贯山东西部的运河对山东历史、文化、经济的影响，并发表一幅表现山东境内运河两岸情形的照片。然而这一类材料是在许多地方都可以找到的，不一定要专家才能提出，如果报纸注意用各种方法向群众搜集，便可以从各种成文的记载和熟悉当地掌故、文物、古迹的地方父老中得到许多这样的材料，经过编辑部的慎重的研究和选择，把其中最可靠的和最有现实意义的部分作为这种专栏的内容，一定可以在很大程度上克服这种专栏的一般化的缺点。
    报纸只有把爱国主义的教育与当地人民的具体感受结合起来，只有利用与国民党反动统治时代的鲜明的对比来宣传爱自己的城市、自己的地区、眼前的美好生活，并把当地生活中和工作中的每一新的变化和新的发展联系到爱祖国、爱我们具有光辉前途的事业上来，才能不断地提高人民群众的爱国主义的感情。也只有这样的宣传才是具有思想性的。
    南京新华日报在这一方面所作的努力是值得提倡的。二月份该报曾两次以画刊半版的篇幅刊载关于宣传爱祖国的图片，二月五日的一次便是以“人民的南京，锦绣的河山”为题的关于南京的介绍。这只是尝试性的努力，也许还不是很有计划的。然而这正是各报宣传爱国主义的专栏所应该努力的方向。
    进行爱国主义的宣传教育是报纸的经常的重要任务，宣传爱国主义的小专栏已受到了读者的欢迎，证明它是值得继续采用的形式之一。但是克服这种专栏的一般化倾向，尚有待于各地报纸工作者的辛勤的努力。
