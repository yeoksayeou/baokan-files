(II) Do a Good Job in Forest Protection and Fire Prevention

Forest protection and fire prevention is the primary task in current forestry work.

Forests are one of the country's important resources, not only directly supplying raw materials needed for industrial, mining, transportation, and construction, but also indirectly playing a significant role in farmland water conservancy and national land security. Due to the historical ruling class's destruction of forests without any construction, the existing forest area in our country is far below the quantity standards that a general country should have; and some of the existing forests are still constantly being destroyed in many areas. The Forestry Work Guidelines issued by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on May 16, 1950, clearly pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize the masses to universally protect forests and strictly prohibit all acts of destroying forests. This is an extremely correct policy to ensure the country's forest resources so that they can be gradually developed on the existing basis.

In the past year or so, all parts of the country, based on the central forest protection policy, have launched struggles against various acts of destroying forests, and have achieved considerable success in preventing theft and indiscriminate felling, fighting mountain and forest fires, and managing firewood gathering and grazing. However, judging from the situation of forest destruction, it shows that our forest protection work is still far from enough, our forests are still suffering serious damage, and forest fires in particular are still the most important enemy of our forest resources. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government: in 1950, the area of forests destroyed nationwide was thirty-two times larger than the afforestation area, and the loss of timber was approximately 2.8 million cubic meters, of which losses due to forest fires accounted for 2.6 million cubic meters. The lives and property of our people's motherland have suffered such staggering losses in forest fires in the past year. Can various regions still turn a blind eye to the work of fire prevention and forest protection?

In the past, many people held some wrong ideas about forest fires, thinking that mountain fires happen every year and are not a big deal. Or they think that mountain fires are natural phenomena and cannot be reversed by human power. This is a kind of paralyzing and backward thinking. With the existence of these paralyzing thoughts, of course, there is a natural lack of enthusiasm for fire prevention and forest protection.

The vast majority of causes of forest fires are man-made. There is no reason why these man-made disasters cannot be prevented. If we can conscientiously and meticulously prevent and eliminate the root causes of forest fires in advance, it may be possible to prevent forest fires from happening at all, or at least reduce the possibility of their occurrence. Even if a fire breaks out occasionally, it can be detected early and extinguished in time. Past experience has adequately told us that it is better to be good at preventing fires than to be brave in fighting fires. This is the basic principle of forest protection work. We must, based on this principle, completely eliminate all man-made factors that can cause forest fires.

The Government Administration Council's instructions pointed out that the work of forest protection and fire prevention must establish and improve forestry administrative organs and mass forest protection organizations, and must regularly conduct publicity and education on forest protection and fire prevention for cadres and the masses. This is the basic method of forest protection and fire prevention. In the past, although the leaders of various regions generally issued some instructions and announcements on forest protection and fire prevention, and did some organizational publicity work, many places failed to implement them conscientiously, either limiting the organizational work to the so-called "organ forest protection organization" from the county to the village, or simply forming the masses into groups, writing down the names, and considering it done, with little actual action such as inspection and training. As a result, the masses think that the forest belongs to the state and has nothing to do with themselves, and they are indifferent when they discover a mountain fire. The fact that no one came out when Hengdaohezi Village in Hailin County, Songjiang Province, rang the bell all night during a fire alarm fully shows that our organizational education work is not good enough. Muling County in Heilongjiang and Songjiang Provinces has suffered particularly light losses from forest fires because the leaders actively pay attention to it, the publicity and education on fire prevention is done well, and the organization and mobilization work is closely grasped. Although Heilongjiang Province experienced 121 mountain fires last year, only one caused a disaster. The consistently active spirit of fire prevention and firefighting in Muling County is also worth learning.

The Government Administration Council's instructions pointed out: now is the spring fire prevention period, and it is especially necessary to strictly prohibit burning wasteland and burning for cultivation in areas that are likely to cause forest and field fires. Why do the masses in many places burn wasteland when reclaiming land? Mainly to burn off the weeds on the ground to facilitate reclamation. Some local cadres have studied with the masses whether it is possible to reclaim land without burning wasteland? Everyone thinks it is possible. It is equally possible to reclaim land by using manual weeding instead of burning wasteland. Although this requires more manpower for weeding, it saves the manpower spent by thousands of people for fighting fires, and protects immeasurable people's wealth. The advantages and disadvantages are extremely obvious. In addition, hunting, grazing, and engaging in sideline production must be strictly prohibited from setting fires. Allowing so-called "organized and led burning of wasteland" in certain areas, or even using burning grass to create firebreaks, is also a source of forest fires, and must be thoroughly corrected in the future. We should strictly manage the mountains and forests in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council and prohibit all acts of setting fire to mountains. Special agents who set fire to mountains should be severely punished.

The number of forest fires caused by locomotive sparks is still quite high. The railway authorities in forest areas and near forest areas should be highly vigilant and responsible for inspecting, installing, and improving devices to prevent sparks from locomotives passing through forest areas, and educate drivers to dispose of furnace ash in safe areas.

Party and government organs and public security departments at all levels in and near forest areas should conscientiously implement the mountain and forest management system, strengthen the organization and education of the masses on forest protection, and specifically combine forest protection and fire prevention work with the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and love the country, so that this great movement can be more deeply developed into every village and every mountain forest. Saving more national resources is also adding more strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Everyone should pay attention to it.

### （二）做好护林防火工作

　　（二）做好护林防火工作
    护林防火是目前林业工作中首要的任务。
    森林是国家的重要资源之一，不但直接可以供应工矿交通建设所需的原料，间接对于农田水利国土保安也有极大的作用。由于中国历来的统治阶级对于森林只有破坏，没有建设，我国现存的森林面积已经远不足一般国家应有的数量标准；而仅有的一些森林，在许多地区还不断受着各种的破坏。中央人民政府政务院在一九五○年五月十六日发布的林业工作方针中，明确地指出了要发动群众普遍护林，严格禁止一切破坏森林的行为，这是确保国家森林资源，以便在现有的基础上逐步发展的极端正确的政策。
    一年多来，全国各地根据中央护林政策，展开了反对各种破坏森林行为的斗争，在防止盗伐、滥伐，扑救山林火灾以及管理樵采放牧等方面，都获得了相当的成绩。但从森林被破坏的情况来看，说明了我们的护林工作，还做得很不够，我们的森林还遭受着严重的破坏，特别是森林火灾，依然是我们森林资源的最主要的敌人。据中央人民政府林垦部的不完全统计：一九五○年全国森林被破坏的面积比造林面积大三十二倍，损失的木材约达二百八十万立方公尺，其中由于森林火灾的损失就占二百六十万立方公尺。我们人民祖国的生命财产，在一年来的林火中，竟遭受了这样惊人的损失。各地对于防火护林工作，还能熟视无睹吗？
    不少的人过去对于森林火灾抱有一些错误观念，认为山火是年年有的事，算不了什么。或者认为山火是自然现象，不是人力所能挽回的。这是一种麻痹的、落后的思想，有了这些麻痹思想的存在，当然对防火护林就自然缺乏积极性。
    发生林火的原因，绝大部分是人为的。对于这些人为的灾害，没有不可以防止的理由。如果我们能认真负责、周密细致地预先防除林火根源，就可能使林火根本无从发生，至少减少发生的可能，即使偶然着火，也能及早发现并及时地加以扑灭。过去已有足够的经验告诉我们，勇于救火不如善于防火，这是护林工作的基本方针，我们必须本着这个方针，彻底消灭一切足以引起林火的人为的因素。
    政务院指示中指出，护林防火工作，必须建立与健全林业行政机构及群众护林组织，必须经常对干部及群众进行护林防火的宣传教育，这是护林防火的基本办法。过去各地区的领导上虽然一般地也曾发布了一些护林防火的指示和布告，做了一些组织宣传工作，但是不少地方还未能认真执行，不是把组织工作局限于由县到村的所谓“机关护林组织”上，就是把群众编组一下，写成了名单就算了事，很少做过检查、训练等实际行动。以致群众认为森林是国家的，与自己无关，发现了山火也漠不关心。像松江省海林县横道河子村虽已建立了防火组织，可是发生火警的时候，敲了一宿钟，却不见一个人出动，就充分说明了我们的组织教育工作做的很不够。黑龙江和松江省穆棱县由于领导上的积极重视，防火宣传教育做得好，组织动员工作抓的紧，因而森林火灾的损失也特别轻。黑龙江省在去年虽发生山火一二一次，只有一次成灾。穆棱县的一贯积极防火救火的精神也是值得学习的。
    政务院指示指出：现值春季防火时期，尤应在足以引起林野火灾的地区，严禁烧荒、烧垦。为什么许多地方群众开垦时要烧荒呢？主要是为的把地面的野草烧干净，便于开垦。有些地方干部曾与群众研究过，是否不烧荒也可以开垦呢？大家认为是可以的。用人工割草代替烧荒，同样是可以开垦的。这样作，虽然割草要多费几个人工，但是节省了成千上万的群众为救火所费的人工，保护了不可计量的人民财富，此中利害，至为明显。此外打猎、放牧、搞副业生产等都要严禁放火。某些地区允许所谓“有组织有领导的烧荒”，甚至采用烧草的办法来开防火道，也是造成森林火灾的一个根源，今后也必须彻底纠正。应该遵照政务院的指示严格进行山林管理，禁止一切放火烧山的行为。对于特务放火烧山，更应加以严办。
    铁路机车喷火所引起的林火次数还是不少。林区及林区附近各铁道主管部门应该严重警惕，负责检查，装设并改进通过林区的机车防止喷火的装置，并教育司机必须在安全地区排除炉灰。
    林区及林区附近各级党政机关和公安部门，要认真执行山林管理制度，加强群众对护林的组织教育工作，把护林防火工作与抗美援朝爱国运动具体地结合起来，使这一伟大的运动更深入展开到每一个村庄、每一座山林里去，多保存一分国家资源，也就是多增加一分抗美援朝的力量，大家应加以注意。
