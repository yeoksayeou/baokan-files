To the Editor:
    Article 24, Section 2 of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The administrative or capitalist side of factories, mines, shops, farms, government agencies, schools and other production or administrative units shall allocate 2% of the total actual wages (including monetary, in-kind, and food allowances) of all employed workers (excluding capitalist agents in private enterprises) to the trade union organization on a monthly basis as trade union funds (of which 1.5% of the total actual wages shall be for workers' cultural and educational expenses)." The Su'nan People's Administrative Office Cultural and Educational Office, having complied with this law, began allocating trade union funds to its affiliated public school education unions in August of last year. However, in January of this year, the East China Military and Political Committee Ministry of Education instructed the Su'nan Cultural and Educational Office: "These funds will be allocated centrally by the central government and should be discontinued in the future." The Su'nan Cultural and Educational Office immediately complied with this instruction and notified all its affiliated public schools to cease allocating trade union funds from January 1951 onwards, and to recover all funds already allocated. At the time, we were unaware of the truth and did not express our attitude. Later, after inquiring with the All-China Federation of Educational Workers Unions, we learned that there was no such regulation. The Su'nan Cultural and Educational Office also sent a special letter to the East China Ministry of Education for instructions, but has not yet received a reply. This measure by the East China Ministry of Education has seriously affected the work of the Su'nan Education Union. Therefore, we request the East China Ministry of Education to answer on what legal basis this measure was taken and how it will be handled in the future.
        Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Education Union, Su'nan

### 华东教育部为何下令  苏南文教处停拨工会经费？

　　华东教育部为何下令  苏南文教处停拨工会经费？编辑同志：
    中华人民共和国工会法第二十四条第二项规定：“工厂、矿场、商店、农场、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方，应按所雇全部职工（私营企业中资方代理人不在内）实际工资（包括货币部分、实物部分与伙食）总额的百分之二，按月拨交工会组织作为工会经费（其中实际工资总额的百分之一点五为职工文化教育费）。”苏南人民行政公署文教处业经遵照此项法令，自去年八月即开始对所属公立学校教育工会拨付工会经费。但今年一月，华东军政委员会教育部指示苏南文教处：“此类经费将由中央统一拨付，以后停止供给。”苏南文教处当即遵示，并通令所属公立学校，自一九五一年一月份起一律停拨工会经费，并将已拨付者悉数追回。当时我们不明真相，未便表示态度。后经询问中国教育工会全国委员会，方知并无此项规定。苏南文教处为此，也曾专函请示华东教育部，但迄今尚未获得答复。华东教育部这一措施，相当严重的影响了苏南教育工会的工作。因此，我们要求华东教育部答复，究竟根据何种法令采取此项措施，今后将如何办理。
