Editor's note: At a time when the people of our country are resolutely demanding the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, in order to better educate everyone and raise political vigilance against counter-revolutionary activities, we should not only draw rich experiences and lessons from the history of our people's revolutionary struggle, but also from the history of international revolutionary struggles. Here, we first study the experience and lessons of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, as summarized by the great teachers of the world revolution, Lenin and Stalin. This should be a work of great practical significance. Lenin's and Stalin's opinions on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries are scattered throughout their many works, and what is collected here is only a small part.

"Counter-revolutionary forces have reared their heads in our rear and among us. Counter-revolutionary forces have been defeated, but they are far from being eliminated." This was said by Lenin in the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to Party Organizations" drafted by him on July 9, 1919. At that time, it was less than two years after the victory of the October Revolution. After the failure of armed intervention, the American, British, and French imperialists were doing their best to support Denikin's counter-revolutionary forces in launching armed riots against the newly emerging socialist state, attempting to restore capitalism. At this time, Lenin called on "Everyone to Fight Denikin!" Lenin put forward several major tasks, one of which was "anti-counter-revolutionary work in the rear." Lenin said, "We know very well the 'breeding grounds' that give rise to counter-revolutionary events, counter-revolutionary rebellions, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies." The counter-revolutionary "breeding grounds" Lenin referred to were the social foundations of counter-revolution. Therefore, he called for "tenfold supervision of these breeding grounds. Tenfold increase in vigilance, because counter-revolutionary conspiracies from this aspect are absolutely inevitable at present and in the near future. Activities such as blowing up bridges, organizing strikes, and conducting various espionage conspiracies on this base will naturally be repeated many times. All centers where counter-revolutionaries might 'harbor,' without exception, must take all the most powerful, systematic, repeated, universal, and sudden preventive measures."

Lenin specifically warned, "Never be deceived by the words and ideas of their leaders (referring to the chief culprits of counter-revolution – editor) and their personal sincerity or hypocrisy. This is important for each of their resumes. But from a political point of view, that is, from the perspective of class relations, from the relationship between millions of people, it is not important."

Regarding these counter-revolutionary elements, Lenin said, "Our task is to directly raise the question. What is the best way to deal with them?" He continued to ask: "Is it better to arrest all the hundreds of rebels who oppose the Soviet regime, that is, support Denikin, lock them up in prison, and sometimes even execute them? Or to let Kolchak and Denikin slaughter tens of thousands of workers and peasants, shoot them all, and whip them all to death?" His answer was: "The choice is not difficult. The question is like this, and only like this. Whoever still does not understand this, whoever only laments the 'injustice' of this decision, is incorrigible, and should be subjected to public ridicule and insult." (The above quotations are all from Lenin's Selected Works, two-volume collection, Moscow Chinese edition, Volume II, "Everyone to Fight Denikin!")

After the exposure of the Trotskyist-Zinovievist traitorous elements' activities of sabotage, espionage, and terrorist assassinations, on March 3 and March 5, 1937, in his reports and conclusions at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin quoted a secret letter to comrades issued by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party on January 18, 1935, due to the assassination of Comrade Kirov by heinous murderers, resolutely warning party organizations at all levels to abandon political sloppiness and vulgar carelessness. This letter stated: "It is necessary to eradicate the opportunistic sloppiness that takes as its starting point the erroneous assumption that as our strength grows, the enemy will become increasingly tame and softened. This assumption is fundamentally wrong. This assumption is a recurrence of right-wing ideology, which wants everyone to believe that the enemy will imperceptibly assimilate into the socialist system, and the enemy will eventually become true socialists. However, we Bolsheviks must never take such a complacent and careless attitude. What we need is not sloppiness but vigilance, the true revolutionary vigilance of the Bolsheviks. Remember that the more hopeless the enemy's situation, the more they love to use extreme measures as the only means of engaging in the final struggle with the Soviet regime. This must be remembered and constantly guarded against."

Stalin pointed out that the reason for the lack of vigilance against the counter-revolutionary elements' activities of sabotage, espionage, and military destruction was primarily because these comrades had forgotten the "capitalist encirclement." "That is to say, in the world, there is one country – the Soviet Union – that has established the socialist system within its borders; at the same time, in addition to it, there are still many countries – bourgeois countries – that continue to live a capitalist life and surround the Soviet Union, waiting for the opportunity to invade it, smash it, or at least harm its power and weaken it." Therefore, "As long as the capitalist encirclement still exists, is it not obvious that in our rear, there will continue to be saboteurs, spies, military wreckers, and murderers sent by foreign intelligence agencies to engage in activities?"

Secondly, Stalin further pointed out: "There is another danger, namely the danger arising from victory, the danger arising from achievements. Yes, comrades, it is precisely the danger arising from victory and from achievements. This danger lies in the fact that people who lack political experience and have not seen much of the world develop an indifferent attitude, complacency, pompousness, and celebration of victory, mutual praise, to the point where they cannot distinguish between major and minor matters, weaken political awareness, become lazy and careless, and rest on their laurels when they encounter a victorious environment – when they see successive victories, step-by-step success, and repeated overfulfillment of plans. No wonder that in this dizzying atmosphere of arrogance and complacency, in this atmosphere of boasting and self-satisfaction, people forget certain facts that are of paramount importance to the fate of our country, and people begin to overlook such unpleasant facts as capitalist encirclement, new forms of sabotage, and the dangers arising from our victories." Stalin repeatedly emphasized: "This is the root cause of the problems of indifference, forgetfulness, sloppiness, and political confusion among our people."

However, there are often some people who try their best to paralyze themselves. They create various reasons to comfort themselves and relax their efforts in thoroughly fighting against counter-revolution. Stalin emphatically criticized these self-deceiving and corrupt theories one by one.

First, Stalin said, "It is necessary to break and discard a corrupt theory, according to which it seems that with each of our advances, the class struggle in our country will become increasingly mitigated; with our victories, the class enemies will become increasingly tame. This is not only a corrupt theory but also a dangerous theory, because it anesthetizes our people, leads them into a trap, and gives the class enemies the opportunity to regroup and carry out the struggle against the Soviet regime. On the contrary, the greater our future progress and the more achievements we make, the more intense the hatred of the remnants of the defeated exploiting classes towards us, the more determined they will be to adopt more violent forms of struggle, the more they will intensify their efforts to harm the Soviet state, and the more they will use the most adventurous and desperate means of struggle to make a final stand. It should be noted that the remnants of the defeated classes in the Soviet Union are not isolated and helpless; they receive direct assistance from enemies outside the Soviet Union. It is wrong to think that the scope of the class struggle is limited to the territory of the Soviet Union. The frontline of the class struggle within the Soviet Union is simultaneously connected to the capitalist countries that surround us. The remnants of the defeated classes cannot be unaware of this. Precisely because they know this, they will continue their adventurous and desperate attacks in the future. This is what history teaches us, and this is what Leninism teaches us. All this must be remembered and constantly guarded against."

Second, Stalin said, "It is necessary to break and discard another corrupt theory, according to which anyone who does not engage in sabotage all the time, but sometimes shows some achievements in his work, cannot be a saboteur. This strange theory itself reveals how naive the inventor of this theory is. Any saboteur, if he does not want to be exposed in the short term, will not engage in sabotage all the time; on the contrary, a true saboteur should sometimes contribute some work achievements, because only in this way can he maintain his status as a saboteur, gain people's trust, and continue his sabotage activities. In my opinion, this question is very clear and does not need further explanation."

Third, Stalin pointed out, "It is necessary to break and discard the third corrupt theory, according to which the regular completion of economic plans can nullify sabotage activities and their ill effects. Theories of this kind can only have one purpose, namely, to encourage the narrow, self-aggrandizing attitude of our staff members towards their own organizations, to comfort them, and to weaken their struggle against sabotage activities."

Fourth, Stalin pointed out, "It is necessary to break and discard the fourth corrupt theory, according to which the Stakhanovite movement is the main means of eliminating sabotage activities. This theory was conceived in order to set aside the attack on saboteurs with loud talk about Stakhanovite workers and the Stakhanovite movement."

Here, Stalin quoted many facts cited by Molotov in his report at the same plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to prove how the Trotskyist and other counter-revolutionary elements in Kuzbass and Donbass at that time gained and used the trust of certain politically indifferent responsible persons, constantly deceiving the Stakhanovite workers and carrying out various sabotage and destructive work. Therefore, Stalin pointed out, "If basic construction projects are carried out by means of sabotage – for example, in Donbass – and as a result, coal mining lags behind and cannot be coordinated with other types of coal mining, then what can be done with Stakhanovite workers alone? In fact, the Stakhanovite movement itself, in order to promote the cause forward and fulfill its great mission, needs us to wage a struggle against all the conspiracies and tricks of the saboteurs and give the movement practical help – is this not obvious? To fight against sabotage activities, to fight for the elimination of sabotage activities, and to stop sabotage activities are necessary conditions for the Stakhanovite movement to develop as widely as possible – is this not obvious?"

Fifth, Stalin pointed out, "It is necessary to break and discard the fifth corrupt theory, according to which the Trotskyist saboteurs no longer have any reserves and that they are now using up their last cadres. Comrades! This is not right. Only naive people can come up with this theory. The Trotskyist saboteurs have their reserves. These are first and foremost the remnants of the exploiting classes who have been defeated in the Soviet Union, and secondly, many groups and organizations abroad that are hostile to the Soviet Union."

Finally, Stalin pointed out, "It is also necessary to break and discard a corrupt theory, according to which, since we Bolsheviks are many and the saboteurs are few, since there are millions of people who support us Bolsheviks and only a handful of people, dozens of people, who support the Trotskyist saboteurs, we Bolsheviks can completely ignore these few saboteurs. Comrades, this is not right! This extremely strange theory was conceived in order to comfort some of our leading comrades who have suffered setbacks in their work because they do not know how to fight against sabotage activities, to numb their vigilance, and to let them rest on their laurels. It is certainly true that the number of people who support the Trotskyist saboteurs is small, while the number of people who support the Bolsheviks is millions. However, this does not mean that saboteurs cannot cause extremely serious damage to our cause. In order to carry out sabotage, it does not require a large number of people. To build the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station requires tens of thousands of workers, but to blow up this project, perhaps at most only a few dozen people are needed. To win a battle requires several armies of the Red Army, but to sabotage this victory on the front line, it only takes a few spies in a certain army headquarters, or even just in a certain division headquarters, who can steal the battle plan and hand it over to the enemy. To build a large railway bridge requires thousands of people, but to blow up this bridge, it only takes a few people. There are countless examples like this."

At the end of his conclusion, Stalin called on the Soviet Communist Party and the people to overcome their weaknesses and completely smash all the destructive conspiracies of the counter-revolutionary elements. He said, "When we eradicate this absurd malady, we can be completely sure that we are not afraid of any internal or external enemies, and we are not afraid of their attacks, because we will continue to smash them in the future as we have in the past and present."

### 列宁、斯大林论镇压反革命

　　列宁、斯大林论镇压反革命
    编者按：在我国人民坚决要求严厉镇压反革命的时候，为了更好地教育每一个人，提高对反革命活动的政治警惕性，我们不但应该从我国人民革命斗争的历史中吸取丰富的经验和教训；而且应该从国际的革命斗争历史中吸取经验和教训。在这里，我们首先从世界革命的伟大导师列宁和斯大林的著作中，学习由他们所集中起来的镇压反革命的经验和教训。这应该是具有重大实际意义的工作。列宁和斯大林关于镇压反革命的意见，散见在他们的许多著作中，这里所辑的只是一小部分。
    “反革命势力在我们后方，在我们中间抬头了。反革命势力虽已被战胜，但远没有被消灭。”这是一九一九年七月九日，列宁在他所起草的《俄国共产党（布）中央委员会致党组织的信》中所说的话。当时是十月革命胜利后不足两年的光景，美、英、法帝国主义在武装干涉失败之后，正在极力支持邓尼金的反革命势力，向新兴的社会主义国家举行武装暴乱，企图复辟。这时候，列宁号召“大家都去与邓尼金斗争！”列宁提出了几项重大任务，其中有一项是“后方肃反工作”。列宁说：“我们知道产生反革命事件，反革命叛乱和反革命阴谋等等的‘策源地’，我们知道得很清楚。”列宁所指的反革命“策源地”就是指的反革命的社会基础。因此，他号召“要十倍地来监督这种策源地。要十倍地提高警惕性，因为从这方面来的反革命密谋，在目前以及在最近将来都是绝对不可避免的。在这个基地上炸毁桥梁，组织罢工，进行各种侦探阴谋等活动，也自然是会多次重复的。凡在反革命‘策源地’稍微可能‘栖身’的一切而无例外的中心，都必须采取各种最强有力的，有系统的，再三再四的，普遍的和突然实行的预防方法。”
    列宁特别提出警告，“决不要被他们领袖（指反革命的首要分子——编者）的言词和观念以及他们个人的诚恳或虚伪所欺骗。这对他们每个人的履历是重要的。但从政治上，即从阶级关系，从几百万人间的关系上看来，并不重要。”
    对于这些反革命分子，列宁说，“我们的任务是应当直接提出问题。究竟怎样办好些呢？”他继续问道：“是去把反对苏维埃政权，亦即拥护邓尼金的几百叛乱分子一律逮捕，关在牢里，有时甚至枪决？抑或是让高尔察克和邓尼金来把几万工农斩尽杀绝，一律枪毙，一概鞭死呢？”他的回答是：“要选择并不难。问题就是这样，而且只是这样。谁要是至今还不了解这点，谁只会对这决定之‘不公正性’诉泣，那他就是不可救药的人，那他就应当遭受大众的嘲笑和侮辱。”（以上引文均见列宁文选两卷集，莫斯科中文版，下卷，《大家都去与邓尼金斗争！》。）
    在反革命的托洛茨基、季诺维夫奸细分子进行暗害，侦探和恐怖暗杀勾当被揭破之后，在一九三七年三月三日及三月五日，斯大林在联共（布）中央全会上的报告和结论中，引述联共中央早在一九三五年一月十八日，因基洛夫同志被万恶凶手暗杀的事，曾发出告同志的秘密信，坚决地警告各级党组织，要抛弃政治上的马虎态度和庸俗的疏忽精神。在这封信中说道：“必须铲除那种以错误设想为出发点的机会主义的马虎态度。这种错误设想，即是以为随着我们力量之增长，敌人就日益驯服和日益软化。这种设想是根本错误的。这种设想乃是右倾思想之复发，这种右倾思想要大家相信，敌人将于无形中同化于社会主义制度，敌人终究会变成真正的社会主义者。可是，我们布尔什维克决不应当抱这种高枕而卧和疏忽的态度。我们所需要的，并不是马虎态度而是警惕精神，真正的布尔什维克的革命警惕精神。要记着，敌人之情况越是没有希望，他们便越爱把极端手段作为与苏维埃政权作最后挣扎斗争之唯一手段。必须记着这一点，而时刻警惕着。”
    对于反革命分子的暗害、侦探以及军事破坏的勾当缺乏警惕性的原因，斯大林指出，这首先是由于这些同志忘记了“资本主义的包围”。“这就是说，在世界上，有一个国家——苏联，在自己境内奠定了社会主义制度；同时，除它而外，却还有许多国家——资产阶级国家，还继续过着资本主义的生活，并包围着苏联，时刻等待时机，以便实行侵犯它，打碎它，或者至少是要损害它的势力而削弱它。”因此，“只要资本主义的包围依然存在，则在我国后方便将继续有被外国侦探机关派来的暗害者、侦探、军事破坏工作者及杀人凶手从事活动，这岂不是显而易见吗？”
    其次，斯大林又指出：“还有另外一种危险，即因有胜利而发生的危险，因有成绩而发生的危险。同志们，是的，正是因有胜利、因有成绩而发生的危险哩。这种危险，就在于政治经验不够的人、阅历不很多的人，一遇到胜利环境，——一看见节节胜利、步步成功、一再超过完成计划——，便发生漠不关心的态度、自满自足、铺张和庆祝胜利、彼此颂扬不休，以至于不能辨别大小轻重、削弱政治知觉、懈怠疏忽、高枕而卧。无怪乎在这种妄自尊大、自满自足的昏沉空气中，在这种夸功自满、趾高气扬的空气中，人们就忘记某些对于我国命运有头等意义的事实，人们竟开始看不出这样一些不惬意的事实，如资本主义的包围、暗害勾当之新方式以及因我们有胜利而发生的危险等等。”斯大林一再着重地说：“我们的人之所以发生漠不关心态度、健忘、马马虎虎、政治上昏愦的毛病，其根源就是如此。”
    但是，往往有一些人极力要麻痹自己，他们制造了种种的理由来安慰自己，放松了对反革命进行彻底的斗争。斯大林曾着重地对这种自欺欺人的腐败理论，一一加以批判。
    第一，斯大林说，“必须打破和抛弃一种腐败的理论，依照这种理论说来，似乎随着我们每次的进展，我国的阶级斗争就会日益和缓起来；随着我们的胜利，阶级敌人就会日益驯服起来。这不仅是一种腐败的理论，而且也是一种危险的理论，因为它麻醉我们的人，把他们引入陷阱，给阶级敌人以重整旗鼓来进行反苏维埃政权斗争的可能。相反的，我们今后的进展愈大，成绩愈多，则已被击破的剥削阶级残余对我们的仇恨亦更甚，他们将更加决意采用更激烈的斗争方式，更其加紧损害苏维埃国家，他们将更利用最冒险拼命的斗争手段以作最后的挣扎。应当注意到，在苏联已被击破的阶级之残余，不是孤立无援的，他们从苏联境外的敌人方面得到直接的援助。如果以为阶级斗争的范围只限于苏联境内，那是错误的。苏联境内的阶级斗争战线，是同时连接到包围我们的资本主义国家内的。关于这一点，已被击破的阶级之残余，是不能不知道的。正因为它们知道这一点，它们今后也将继续其冒险拼命的袭击。历史正是这样教训我们，列宁主义正是这样教训我们。必须记着这一切，并时刻警戒着。”
    第二，斯大林说，“必须击破和抛弃另一种腐败的理论，依照这种理论说来，凡不时时实行暗害，而有时尚在工作中表示一些成绩者，就不会是暗害分子。这种奇怪理论本身，就揭露出这理论发明者是如何幼稚。凡是暗害分子，如果不想在短期内就被揭破，便不会时刻都实行暗害；恰巧相反，真正的暗害分子，正应当有时也贡献一些工作成绩，因为只有这样，他才能保持其暗害分子的地位，才能骗得人家的信任，才能继续其暗害的勾当。据我看来，这个问题是很清楚，用不到再加解说。”
    第三，斯大林指出，“必须打破和抛弃第三种腐败的理论，依照这种理论说来，经济计划之经常完成，就能使暗害行为及其恶果化为乌有。这类的理论只能有一个目的，即鼓励我们工作人员那种狭隘的、各自夸耀自己的机关的态度，安慰他们，削弱他们反对暗害勾当的斗争。”
    第四，斯大林指出，“必须打破和抛弃第四种腐败的理论，依照这种理论说来，斯达哈诺夫运动，乃是足以消灭暗害勾当的主要的手段。这种理论之所以设想出来，是要以关于斯达哈诺夫式劳动者和斯达哈诺夫运动的响亮的空谈来撇开对暗害分子的打击。”
    在这里，斯大林引述莫洛托夫在这同一次联共（布）中央全会上的报告中举出的许多事实，证明当时发现的在库兹巴斯和顿巴斯方面，托洛茨基等反革命分子，如何取得与利用某些在政治上漠不关心的负责人的信任，经常欺骗了斯达哈诺夫式劳动者，进行各种捣乱和破坏工作。因此，斯大林指出，“如果基本建设工程是以暗害办法进行——例如在顿巴斯——，而结果使采煤工作落后，不能与其他各种采煤工作相配合，那末，光靠斯达哈诺夫式劳动者会有什么办法呢？其实，斯达哈诺夫运动本身，为要推动事业前进而完成其伟大的使命，就需要我们进行斗争以反对暗害分子的一切阴谋诡计，而给该运动以切实帮助，——这难道不是显而易见吗？与暗害勾当作斗争，为消灭暗害勾当而斗争，制止暗害勾当，是使斯达哈诺夫运动能尽量广泛开展的必要条件，——这难道不是显而易见吗？”
    第五，斯大林指出，“必须打破和抛弃第五种腐败的理论，依照这种理论说来，以为托洛茨基暗害分子再没有什么后备力量了，以为他们现在已在用尽其最后的一些干部了。同志们！这是不对的。只有思想幼稚的人，才能想出这种理论来。托洛茨基暗害分子，是有其后备力量的。这首先就是在苏联已被击破的剥削阶级之残余，其次就是国外许多仇视苏联的集团和组织。”
    最后，斯大林指出，“还必须打破和抛弃一种腐败的理论，依照这种理论说来，既然我们布尔什维克很多，暗害分子很少，既然拥护我们布尔什维克的有千百万群众，而拥护托洛茨基暗害分子的只有屈指可数的几个人、几十个人，那末，我们布尔什维克就可以根本不去注意这寥寥无几的暗害分子。同志们，这是不对的！这种异常奇怪的理论之所以设想出来，是为的要安慰我们某些因为不会与暗害勾当作斗争，而在工作上遭受了失败的领导同志，是为的麻醉他们的警惕性，让他们高枕而卧。说拥护托洛茨基暗害分子的人屈指可数，而拥护布尔什维克的人却有千百万，这当然是对的。可是，决不能因此就说，暗害分子不能给我们的事业以极严重的损害。为要实行捣乱，实行暗害，并不需要大批的人。为要建筑第聂伯尔工程，是需要成千成万的工人，但要炸毁这一工程，也许至多只需要几十个人。为要打胜仗，是需要几军的红军，但为要在前线上破坏这一胜利，却只要在某个军部，甚至于只要在某个师部内有几个能偷出作战计划而交与敌军的侦探就够了。为要建筑大的铁路桥，需要数千人，但要炸毁这桥梁，却只需要几个人就够了。像这样的例子是举不胜举的。”
    在结论的终了，斯大林号召苏联共产党和人民，克服自己的弱点，去彻底粉碎反革命分子的一切破坏阴谋。他说，“当我们铲除了这种荒谬的弊病时，我们便可以完全有把握地说，我们不怕任何内奸外敌，我们不怕他们的袭击，因为我们今后也将与过去和现在一样粉碎他们。”（以上引文均见斯大林选集，解放社版第五卷，《论党工作之缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法》）
