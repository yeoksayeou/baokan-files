Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

To the Editors:
　　The criticism made by Comrade Wang Tingzhen in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on February 14th regarding the frequent accidents at the Datong Mining Bureau is correct. Since January of this year, our bureau has indeed experienced a series of casualties, and these accidents could have been avoided. The main reasons are: (1) Leading cadres lacked the idea of relying on the working class and failed to accept workers' suggestions to strengthen security equipment in a timely manner. (2) Leading cadres did not delve deeply into their work and failed to check security conditions in a timely manner. Some projects should have been repaired quickly; however, to avoid increasing costs, they were not repaired in a timely manner. Although some projects were repaired, they were built hastily due to the single-minded pursuit of reducing costs and rushing production. (3) The security system was unsound, and labor discipline was lax. For example, the Baidong Well had instructed workers not to dig coal pillars. However, due to a lack of thorough inspection, workers continued to dig, resulting in an accident. Although the bureau repeatedly called for "safe production for workers" and "strengthening security education," it did not attract the attention of all mine workers due to a lack of specific leadership.

　　Based on the above-mentioned problems and the criticisms made by Comrade Wang Tingzhen, we have decided to make the following improvements:

　　(1) It is now spring, and the soil quality will change. We plan to hold the first quarterly safety inspection in advance to thoroughly inspect the security equipment of each mine and the construction that does not meet standards.

　　(2) Conscientiously investigate the causes of accidents and identify responsibilities. Those who neglect security and are derelict in their duties will be given due punishment. Launch a campaign against accidents to make all employees aware that responsibility for an accident is a criminal act, in order to prevent accidents.

　　(3) Strengthen employee security education to make security work a mass movement. On the one hand, provide security classes for workers, and on the other hand, use newspapers, slogans, oral communication, songs, jingles, and other forms to conduct in-depth publicity, so that everyone understands security and values ​​security.

　　(4) Strengthen the regularity of security work and oppose the complacency and complacency of employees towards security work. The bureaucratic work style of leaders should also be thoroughly eliminated. Humbly accept workers' rationalization proposals.

　　The above are the specific measures taken by our bureau to improve security work recently. We hope that comrades who care about our mine will offer more suggestions to help us do a better job in security work.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Datong Mining Bureau

### 大同矿务局拟订改进保安工作计划

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　大同矿务局拟订改进保安工作计划编辑同志：
    贵报二月十四日，《读者来信》栏刊登王廷贞同志对大同矿务局事故层出的批评，这一批评是正确的。我局自今年一月以来，的确是连续发生伤亡事故多起，这些事故都是可以避免而没有避免的。主要是由于：（一）领导干部缺乏依靠工人阶级思想，没有接受工人建议，及时加强保安设备。（二）领导干部工作不深入，没有及时检查保安情况。有些工程本应很快检修；但为了怕提高成本，没有及时检修；有的工程虽然检修了，但也由于单纯追求减低成本和突击生产，建筑得很草率。（三）保安制度不健全，劳动纪律松懈。如白洞井曾经指示不许工人刨煤柱。但因没有很好检查，工人照样地刨，结果出了事故。本局虽经一再号召“工人安全生产”“加强保安教育”；但由于缺乏具体领导，并未引起全矿职工的注意。
    我们根据上述所存在的问题及王廷贞同志所提出的批评，决定这样改进：
    （１）现在正值春季，土质将有变化。我们拟提前举行第一季的安全大检查，将各矿井的保安设备及不合乎规格的建设，彻底加以检修。
    （２）切实检查事故原因，查明责任。对忽视保安和失职人员予以应得的处分。开展反事故斗争，使全体职工知道出了责任事故就是犯罪行为，以杜绝事故。
    （３）加强职工保安教育，使保安工作成为群众性运动。一方面给工人上保安课，一方面通过报刊、标语、口头传播、歌曲、顺口溜等形式深入宣传。使每一个人都懂得保安、重视保安。
    （４）加强保安工作的经常性，反对职工中对保安工作的麻痹和自满思想。领导上的官僚主义作风也应加以彻底肃清。虚心接受工人的合理化建议。
    以上是本局最近改进保安工作的具体措施。希望关心本矿的同志多提意见，帮助我们把保安工作搞的更好。
                大同矿务局
