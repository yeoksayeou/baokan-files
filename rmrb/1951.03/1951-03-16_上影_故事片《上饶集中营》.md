During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempted to halt the resistance against Japan and surrender to the Japanese invaders to implement their traitorous policies, not hesitating to launch an anti-communist civil war. Therefore, in 1939-40, they launched a large-scale offensive against the anti-Japanese base areas of our Eighth Route Army in North China. In January 1941, with 200,000 bandit troops, they launched a treacherous and shameless attack on our New Fourth Army, which insisted on resisting Japan south of the Yangtze River, creating the shocking皖南事变 (Wannan Incident) that shocked China and foreign countries.

At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits implemented a fascist, brutal, and bloody reign of terror domestically. The number of patriotic masses, righteous people, and progressive youths arrested and killed throughout the country was countless. In order to threaten, humiliate, abuse, and massacre General Ye Ting and the seven or eight hundred New Fourth Army cadres who were captured by conspiracy during the Wannan Incident, as well as the two or three hundred patriotic people arrested in the southeastern provinces, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ordered their special agent system to establish a large-scale concentration camp in Shangrao, where the Third War Zone of the bandit Gu Zhutong was located, under the guise of the "Southeast Branch of the Wartime Central Youth Training Corps" to cover the eyes and ears of the people. Under the devilish rule of special agent bosses like Zhang Chao, the sinister and tyrannical Xiao, squadron leaders Liu and Zeng, female squadron leaders, and various special agents, they wantonly manipulated this group of "prisoners."

These prisoners who were "guilty of patriotism" and "guilty of resisting Japan" were forced to do hard labor with bayonets, opening up large and small playgrounds for endless running, not allowed to think; building walls and setting up iron nets to create prisons for confinement. Everyone's mood was uneasy, hidden special agents were monitoring their actions, the special agents were teasing female comrades, the female squadron leader splashed fecal water on female comrades, and forced them to run with shackles. Comrade Lü Zhen, who was gang-raped by a dozen bandit soldiers during her capture and became disabled, was not given medical treatment or food... These tortures were intended to force them to surrender, but the revolutionary integrity of the comrades was firm and unyielding, and became even stronger under the leadership of the underground party, solidifying their determination to fight their way out.

Old Professor Zhou Zhiheng cursed the Kuomintang even in his sleep, and military cadre Sun Gang beat the special agent Xie Bailun, and the resentment filled in his heart continued to grow. Wang Daming and Li Hua discovered that the New Fourth Army was growing stronger and was reorganized in the enemy's rear in northern Jiangsu, and the news that Chen Yi was acting as the commander was immediately spread and they were excited and cheered for it, loudly singing the New Fourth Army anthem; the special agents invited a fat instructor to give absurd speeches to anesthetize them, and the righteous Zhou Zhiheng and overseas Chinese student Tian Feiju stood up to resist on the spot, although they encountered unfortunate punishments and severe torture, they never yielded, which frustrated the special agents, so they printed repentance letters to force them to surrender, on the contrary they tore them into pieces, and under the heavy machine gun guard they shouted "Long live the Communist Party" to give heavy counterattacks and resistance, making the special agents tremble.

Therefore, the special agents further launched high pressure to carry out all kinds of despicable and brutal means. A snub-nosed special agent coveted elementary school teacher Su Lin, wanting to use seduction to force her to surrender; Shi Zhen firmly refused the condition of "medical treatment in exchange for surrender," and was tied with a large stone and pushed into a deep pool to be buried alive. The special agents also押(escorted) Su Lin there, wanting to use her as bait to threaten surrender, but she felt the noble integrity of the communists, and also jumped into the deep pool to殉葬 (martyr herself). Revolutionary comrades who were considered "stubborn" and resolutely unyielding were confined and deprived of food, farmer Zhang Sifu was beaten on the buttocks for stealing food, and Wang Daming, Li Hua, and others were押(escorted) to Maojialing, the living hell of death. Another batch of thirty revolutionary comrades were collectively shot and killed in a small river, and the special agents妄想 (vainly hoped) to extinguish the force of resistance in this way. And when they were unable to do anything, they阴谋 (conspired) to forge an anti-communist declaration by Zhao Hong, a major organizational member, to coerce his surrender and shake the will of the comrades. When this false declaration was distributed to the various teams, they firmly believed in Zhao Hong's loyalty to the Party and collectively tore it up as a powerful expression, but Zhao Hong's steadfastness foiled the special agent's trick, and he and a dozen senior cadres were collectively strangled.

His sacrifice was a loss to the organization, and another organizational member, Lü Gong, replaced him to lead the struggle. The various teams mourned Zhao Hong and strengthened their determination to fight resolutely.

In 1942, the Japanese invaders invaded along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and Jinhua and Quzhou fell one after another. Shangrao was threatened by air raids, and the situation became increasingly tense. The revolutionary comrades imprisoned in Maojialing, under the leadership of Li Hua, Wang Daming, and others, launched a great armed uprising, throwing themselves towards the Red Army base area in Wuyi Mountain. This gave the special agents a major blow, so the surveillance and suppression of the revolutionary comrades became even more serious. As Shangrao retreated, in order to continue to implement their humiliation and bloody policies, the concentration camp moved to Fujian.

Along the way, a large number of revolutionary comrades were slaughtered, which made the comrades' determination to fight out and resist Japan even stronger. During the tense march, they secretly discussed and prepared for a fierce uprising at any time. Finally, when they arrived at Chishizhen in northern Fujian, under the leadership of Lü Gong, they launched a magnificent all-out uprising, destroying this bloody prison and massacre. Only then did they escape death, and enthusiastically reunited with the comrades who revolted in Maojialing and the guerrilla brothers in Wuyi Mountain, and returned to the embrace of the people's ranks. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, they carried out tenacious struggles against the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits until they won the liberation and freedom of the whole nation.

    上影·故事片《上饶集中营》

    主要演员  汤化达　林农江俊　项堃  卢敏　沈扬
  抗日战争时，蒋匪企图中止抗日，投降日寇以贯彻其卖国政策，竟不惜发动反共内战。因此在一九三九——四○年，就大举进攻我华北八路军的抗日根据地。一九四一年一月间，更以二十万匪军，向我在大江以南坚持抗日的新四军，进行背义无耻的袭击，造成了震惊中外的皖南事变。
  那时蒋匪对内实施法西斯残暴恐怖的血腥政策，全国爱国群众，正义人士与进步青年被捕和被杀者，多至无可计数，为了威胁、凌辱、虐待与屠杀我在皖南事变时被阴谋俘去的叶挺将军和新四军干部七八百人，及在东南各省被捕的爱国人士二三百人，蒋匪特令其特务系统在第三战区顾祝同匪徒司令部所在地上饶，设立了规模宏大的集中营，打着“战时中央青年训导团东南分团”的招牌，来掩盖人民的耳目，在以特务头子为首的张超，阴恶暴戾的萧某，中队长刘某、曾某，女中队长和大小特务的魔鬼统治下，肆意的摆布这批“囚犯”。
  这些“爱国有罪”，“抗日有罪”的囚犯们，被枪刺强迫着做苦工，开辟大小操场用来无止息的跑步，不准思想；筑围墙布铁网用来做监禁的牢狱，大家的心情是不安的，隐藏的特务分子在监视着行动，特务们在调笑着女同志，女中队长把粪水泼女同志，带了铁镣罚跑步。被俘时十几个匪军轮奸成了残废的旅珍同志，不给医不给吃……这些折磨就是要迫他们自首，可是同志们的革命气节是坚贞不屈的，却在地下党的领导中更坚强起来，巩固了必须战斗出去的决心。
  老教授周志恒说梦话也在诅咒国民党，军事干部孙钢痛打了特务谢百伦和填在心里的愤恨都在增长起来，王大明和李华发现了新四军又力量壮大地在苏北敌后整编完成，由陈毅代理军长的消息，立即就传遍了并且为此欣喜振奋，大声高唱起了新四军军歌；特务们请来了胖教官发表荒谬的胡言想麻醉他们，正义感的周志恒和华侨学生田飞驹就当场起来反抗，虽然遭遇到不幸的处罚和严刑拷打始终不屈，这可伤透了特务的脑筋，就印发悔过书来强迫自首，相反的是以撕成碎片，并且在重机枪戒备下高呼“共产党万岁”来沉重的回击和反抗，使得特务们发抖。
  于是特务们进一步展开了高压力，来进行一切鄙劣残暴的手段。一个翘鼻子特务垂涎小学教员苏琳，想用诱惑逼她自首；施珍坚决不答应“自首就给医病”的条件，就被捆了大石推下深潭活葬。特务把苏琳也押去想用陪绑来威胁自首，但她感受了崇高的共产党人的气节，却随着跳下深潭壮烈的殉葬；被认为“顽固”的坚决不屈的革命同志被禁闭绝食，农民张四富为了偷饭被他们打烂屁股，王大明，李华等就被押到死罪的茅家岭活地狱去。又有整批的三十位革命同志被集体枪杀在小河中，特务们妄想这样来扑灭反抗的力量。并且在无计可施之下，阴谋伪造了一位主要的组织分子赵宏同志的反共宣言，来威逼他的自首和动摇同志们的意志，当各队散发到这份假宣言时，坚决信任赵宏同志对党的忠诚，同样采取了集体撕毁这有力的表示，可是赵宏同志的始终不渝使特务诡计挫败，就和十几个高级干部被集体勒毙。
  他的牺牲对组织上是一个损失，另一个组织分子吕功就代替了他来领导斗争，各队以哀悼赵宏加强了坚决战斗的决心。
  一九四二年日寇沿浙赣路进犯，金华，衢州先后沦陷，上饶受到了空袭的威胁，形势日见紧张，被囚在茅家岭的革命同志在李华，王大明等领导下就发动了伟大的夺枪暴动，投向武夷山的红军根据地。这给了特务们重大的打击，于是对革命同志的监视和压制更加严重起来，随着上饶大撤退，为着继续实施他们的凌辱和血腥政策，集中营就移向福建去。
  沿途大批的屠杀革命同志，使同志们对战斗出去抗日的决心愈形强烈，在紧张的行军中，随时密议准备着激烈的暴动，终于当到达闽北赤石镇时，在吕功的领导下展开了全体大暴动的壮烈战斗，摧毁了这个血腥监禁屠杀的魔掌，才脱出了死亡，在武夷山上与茅家岭暴动的同志和游击弟兄们热烈地会师，重又投入人民队伍的怀抱，在党和毛主席的领导下，与日寇、蒋匪进行顽强的斗争，直到获得了全国人民的解放自由。
