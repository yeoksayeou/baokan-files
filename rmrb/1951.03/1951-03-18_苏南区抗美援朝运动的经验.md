　　The Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in the cities and villages of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region has achieved great success. The experiences of the Southern Jiangsu Region are worth referencing by other regions.

　　The patriotic Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in the cities of Southern Jiangsu began successively from mid-October to early November last year. After late December, it developed from cities to market towns and villages. By February this year, it had become widespread in all cities and most market towns and villages. Currently, this movement is continuing to develop in depth, centering on the opposition to the United States' arming of Japan.

　　The scale of the movement is large, the enthusiasm of the people is high, and the content of the movement is rich. In cities such as Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, more than 600,000 people from all walks of life participated in demonstrations. Demonstrations were also widely held in rural areas. In Songjiang Prefecture alone, more than 800,000 farmers participated in demonstrations (total participation in the prefecture exceeded one million). Seventy-four enterprises in the Southern Jiangsu Region have launched patriotic production competitions, and thirty-four units have challenged the Ma Hengchang Production Group in the Northeast. Production efficiency has been greatly improved in the competition. For example, in spinning mills, the average daily yarn output per spindle has increased from 0.8 pounds to 0.9 pounds, and some have exceeded 1 pound. In Wuxi City alone, 15,000 workers participated in the winter defense patrol. The land reform struggle of the peasants is closely combined with the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. The broad masses of peasants, recognizing that the landlord class is the "eyes and ears" of American imperialism, actively participated in the anti-feudal struggle, and after the completion of land reform, enthusiastically participated in the people's armed forces under the slogan of "arming to defend the fruits of land reform." Peasants in various regions also launched a wave of grain delivery under the slogan of "paying patriotic grain to support Resist-America, Aid-Korea," and completed the autumn tax collection task in half a month. Approximately 1.6 million people in Songjiang Prefecture participated in the grain delivery and military service movement under the banner of patriotism. An old lady in Songjiang County had someone write a flag that said "Paying grain for the benefit of descendants for generations" and stuck it on the grain bag to pay the grain, which moved many farmers, and everyone paid early and paid well. More than 13,000 young students in the Southern Jiangsu Region applied to military cadre schools, accounting for more than half of the eligible students. More than 100 students from more than a dozen church schools also applied. The industrial and commercial sectors also widely participated in patriotic activities, signed and practiced patriotic covenants, and enthusiastically paid taxes. In cities such as Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou, urban areas in twenty-one counties such as Nanhui and Wujiang, and more than eighty towns, the industrial and commercial sectors implemented collective tax payment. Not only were new taxes generally paid on time, but also outstanding taxes were paid off in full or in large part. The fact that more than 300 industrial and commercial households in Tinglin Town, Songjiang, paid off their taxes in two hours, and the industrial and commercial sectors in Zhuqiao Town, Nanhui, formed a team to beat gongs and drums and ran more than ten miles to the county seat to pay taxes, are prominent examples. In the religious community, the Suzhou Church Federation, including twenty-eight units, and some religious figures in Zhenjiang and Wuxi have issued patriotic declarations. In the medical field, doctors from Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and other places participated in volunteer medical teams to serve in Korea. In addition, in the patriotic movement, a vast propaganda force has also begun to be organized. At present, there are more than 3,000 reading groups, more than 10,000 blackboard newspapers, and many rural drama troupes (109 in Wujin County alone) in Southern Jiangsu, and more than 8,000 propagandists have been established. These have laid a good foundation for carrying out regular mass propaganda work in the future.

　　The main experiences of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in Southern Jiangsu are:

　　(1) The key to carrying out the movement is that the leading organs attach importance to this work and regard it as a constantly effective driving force for promoting various reforms and construction works. The understanding of the importance of this work by leading workers at all levels has been gradually improved. Initially, many work cadres had various incorrect understandings of this work: some believed that it was just ordinary current affairs study and publicity, and it would pass after a while; some said that this work conflicted with other work, especially with land reform work, so only a part of the people were sent to carry out a surprise attack; some thought that the purpose of this movement was just to recruit students for military cadre schools. These incorrect understandings have been gradually corrected through the continuous instructions and education of the East China and Southern Jiangsu leading organs and their own practical experience of the great role of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. The results of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement have surprised many work cadres, because with this, all work has become easier. Therefore, they truly experienced that the propaganda and education work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea is indeed a great driving force for promoting the development of other work, and realized that this work should be regarded as the most important work to do, and should make it continue to be popularized and developed in depth. This experience is very important, because if the leading organs and work cadres at all levels do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of this work and do not seriously lead it, this work will definitely not be done well.

　　(2) The propaganda and education movement of Resist-America, Aid-Korea should be combined with the actual work of various reforms and constructions in the region, and also with the specific situation of different propaganda and education objects (their immediate interests, their experiences). Therefore, it is necessary to propose specific slogans and different requirements under the general political slogans of Resist-America, Aid-Korea and defending the country, according to the local actual work in different periods (such as autumn tax collection, winter defense, land reform, etc.), and in view of the different situations of different propaganda objects. Only in this way can the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement become a driving force for promoting the development of other work, can the content of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement be diverse and rich, so that it can be carried out regularly and persistently, and can the Resist-America propaganda truly touch the hearts of the people of all different classes, thereby rapidly improving their patriotic awareness and enthusiasm.

　　(3) Convening people's representative conferences of all circles to Resist-America, Aid-Korea is an important method to universally promote the development of the movement. Such meetings can be city-wide or county-wide, or can be convened at all levels below the city and county. The general experience is that, first, hold current affairs symposiums and current affairs report meetings to conduct publicity and deliberation among the people of all circles, including mobilizing the people of all circles to accuse the atrocities of American and Japanese aggressors, and then hold representative conferences of people of all circles at all levels to Resist-America, Aid-Korea and oppose the United States' arming of Japan. The representatives attending the meeting should include as widely as possible representatives of advanced, middle, and backward masses from all walks of life. At such meetings, there should be pre-prepared reports on the situation and tasks of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and mobilize everyone to discuss and accuse, and finally formulate a patriotic action program for the people of all circles in the local area. After the meeting, organize representatives from all walks of life to go back to make transmission reports, so as to universally launch the patriotic movement.

　　(4) Mobilizing people from all walks of life to recall and accuse the crimes of American and Japanese aggressors, and comparing the differences in political and economic life before and after liberation, is a universally effective method to improve the patriotic feelings of urban and rural people in hating American imperialism and loving the motherland, thereby promoting the development of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. In addition to cities, the application of this method in rural areas generally involves cadres summarizing the work of the past period, conducting current affairs propaganda, calculating victory accounts, comparing the past and present life, and organizing recollections and accusations (connecting the crimes of landlords, Chiang bandits, and Japan to the crimes of American imperialism). By doing so, a patriotic upsurge can be quickly set off. Cai, an old lady from Fan'ai Township, Fengxian County, sent four sons and a son-in-law to the army after recalling and comparing, which is a typical example.

　　(5) Mobilizing various propaganda forces (such as newspapers, radio stations, literature and art, drama troupes, blackboard newspapers, earthen radios, etc.), unifying command, and carrying out propaganda in various ways can achieve effective and concentrated propaganda and education effects.

　　(6) Grasping typical events or model figures in the movement and promoting them. The former is, for example, the struggle of people from all walks of life in Suzhou against a female preacher, Long Xiangzhi, who spread reactionary remarks. The latter is, for example, the Southern Jiangsu Daily's commendation of Professor Liu Baichuan of the College of Arts and Education for sending his son to participate in the military cadre school, which had a great impact in various parts of Southern Jiangsu.

　　(7) After propaganda and education, various mass patriotic activities should be organized. Demonstrations have a great educational effect on the people, and should and can be carried out in cities and villages. In cities, separate demonstrations by people from all walks of life should also be organized, and such marching teams themselves are a propaganda team. On the basis of demonstrations, it is also necessary to further organize the masses to carry out various patriotic activities such as writing letters of condolences, donating condolences, enthusiastically paying taxes, paying grain, and joining the army, and such activities should be renewed every day.

　　(8) Signing patriotic covenants for all walks of life and each small unit and implementing them is a good way to consolidate the achievements of the patriotic movement. The industrial and commercial sectors of all towns in Southern Jiangsu have signed patriotic covenants, and some have also signed tax protection covenants. At present, all industries and smaller units are continuing to generally formulate specific patriotic covenants and check their implementation. After completing land reform, farmers in Taicang and other counties in Southern Jiangsu also held meetings by township to sign patriotic covenants. They guaranteed to increase production, pay enough public grain, strengthen militia activities, strictly control landlords, support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen, and do a good job in substitute farming.

　　Although the Resist-America, Aid-Korea patriotic movement in the Southern Jiangsu Region has achieved great success, there are still a few rural areas that have not been launched at all, and some of the places where the movement has developed have cooled down again. The main reason for this phenomenon is that some leading cadres have developed a mentality of being satisfied with the temporary grand and vigorous situation, or even have the idea that it should be brought to an end. This incorrect idea must be corrected to make the movement more universally and deeply developed.

　　苏南区抗美援朝运动的经验
    苏南行政区城市和乡村的抗美援朝运动，已获得很大成绩。苏南区的经验是值得各地参考的。
    苏南各城市的抗美援朝爱国运动，系于去年十月中至十一月初先后展开，十二月下旬以后，即由城市向集镇及农村发展，到今年二月间，已普及所有城市及大部分集镇和乡村。现在这个运动正以反对美国武装日本为中心，继续深入发展。
    运动的规模很大，人民群众情绪很热烈，运动内容很丰富。无锡、苏州、常州、镇江等城市各界人民参加示威游行的共达六十余万人。乡村中也广泛举行了游行示威，松江一个专区，参加游行示威的农民共达八十余万人（全专区参加游行人数共达一百余万人）。苏南全区已有七十四个企业单位的工人展开爱国生产竞赛，并有三十四个单位向东北马恒昌生产小组应战。在竞赛中生产效率大为提高，例如纺纱厂中每个锭子每日产纱量一般已由零点八磅提高到零点九磅，并有超过一磅的。仅无锡一市，参加冬防纠察队的工人，即达一万五千人。农民的土地改革斗争与抗美援朝运动密切地结合着。广大的农民因为认识到地主阶级是美国帝国主义的“千里眼、顺风耳”而积极参加反封建斗争，并在土地改革完成以后，在“武装保卫土地改革果实”的口号下踊跃参加人民的武装。各地农民还在“缴爱国粮支援抗美援朝”的口号下，掀起缴粮热潮，在半个月内就全部完成了秋征任务。松江一个专区在爱国主义的旗帜下参加缴粮及参军运动的约达一百六十万人。松江县一个老太太找人代写了一幅“缴子孙万代翻身粮”的旗子插在粮袋上去缴粮，感动了许多农民，大家都交早交好。苏南区青年学生报名参加军事干部学校的共达一万三千余人，占适龄学生半数以上。十多个教会学校一百多名学生也报了名。工商界也广泛参加爱国活动，签订并实践爱国公约，踊跃缴税。无锡、常州、苏州等城市，南汇、吴江等二十一个县的城区以及八十多个镇的工商界都实行集体纳税。不但新税一般如期缴清，欠税也全部或大部缴清。松江亭林镇三百多工商户在两小时内纳完税款，南汇祝桥镇工商界排成队伍敲锣打鼓跑十多里路到县城纳税，就是显著的例子。宗教界中，包括有二十八个单位的苏州教联会和镇江、无锡的部分宗教界人士，已发表爱国宣言。医务界中无锡、镇江、常州等地都有医师参加志愿医疗队赴朝鲜服务。此外，在爱国运动中，广大的宣传队伍也开始组织起来了。目前全苏南已有三千多个读报组，一万多块黑板报，很多的农村剧团（仅武进县即有一百零九个），建立了八千多个宣传员。这些为今后进行经常的群众宣传工作打下了良好的基础。
    苏南抗美援朝运动的主要经验是：
    （一）运动开展的关键是领导机关重视这个工作，把它看作是推进各项改革和建设工作的经常起作用的动力。各级领导工作人员对这个工作重要性的认识是逐步提高的。起初，许多工作干部对这个工作曾有各种不正确的认识：有的认为这不过是普通的时事学习和时事宣传，只要一阵子就会过去了；有的说，这个工作与其他工作有矛盾，特别是与土地改革工作有矛盾，因此只派一部分人去突击一下；有的以为这个运动的目的不过是为了招收军事干部学校的学生。这些不正确的认识，经过华东和苏南领导机关的不断指示教育和他们自己对抗美援朝运动伟大作用的实际体验，都逐步纠正过来了。抗美援朝运动的成果，使许多工作干部都觉得奇怪，因为这一来，一切工作都好做了。因而他们就真正体验到，抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，的确是推动其他工作发展的伟大动力，认识到应该把这一工作看作最重要的工作去做，应该使它继续普及和深入地发展。这一条经验是十分重要的，因为如果各级领导机关和工作干部对于这个工作的重要性认识不足，不去认真领导，这个工作是一定做不好的。
    （二）抗美援朝的宣传教育运动，应与本地区的各项改革和建设的实际工作相结合，又应与不同的宣传教育对象的具体情况（他们的切身利益，他们的经验）相结合。因此，就要根据不同时期的当地实际工作（例如秋征、冬防、土地改革等），并针对不同宣传对象的不同情况，在一般的抗美援朝保家卫国的政治口号之下，提出具体的口号和不同的要求。只有这样，才能使抗美援朝运动成为推动其他工作发展的动力，才能使抗美援朝运动的内容多样而丰富，因而可以经常持久地进行下去，才能使抗美援朝的宣传，真正打动各不同阶层人民群众的心坎，从而迅速提高他们的爱国认识和积极性。
    （三）召开各界人民抗美援朝代表会议，是普遍推动运动发展的重要方法。这样的会议可以是全市或全县性的，也可以在市、县以下各级召开。一般的经验是，首先举行时事座谈会和时事报告会，在各界人民中进行宣传和酝酿，包括发动各界人民控诉美日侵略者的暴行，然后即可举行各级各界人民的抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的代表会议。出席会议的代表应尽可能广泛地包括各界各业的先进的、中间的、落后的群众的代表。在这样的会议上应有预先准备好的抗美援朝形势和任务的报告，并发动大家讨论和控诉，最后制订当地各界人民的爱国行动纲领。会后即组织各界各业代表回去作传达报告，以便使爱国运动普遍地发动起来。
    （四）发动各界人民回忆、控诉美国和日本侵略者的罪行，对比解放前后政治经济生活的不同，是提高城乡人民仇恨美帝国主义、热爱祖国情绪，因而推进抗美援朝运动发展的普遍有效的方法。除了在城市以外，这个方法在农村中的运用，一般是由干部总结过去一个时期的工作，进行时事宣传，算胜利账，对比今昔生活，组织回忆、控诉（从地主、蒋匪、日本的罪恶联系到美帝国主义的罪恶）。这样做，就能很快掀起爱国高潮。奉贤县范爱乡蔡老太太，在回忆、对比以后，把四个儿子和一个女婿一齐送去参军，就是一个典型的例子。
    （五）动员各种宣传力量（例如报纸、广播台、文艺、戏剧团、黑板报、土广播等）、统一指挥，用各种方式进行宣传，方能收到有效的集中的宣传教育效果。
    （六）在运动中抓住典型事例或模范人物加以推广，前者例如苏州各界人民对一个传播反动言论的女布道员龙襄之的斗争，后者例如苏南日报对文教学院一教授刘百川送子参加军干校的表扬，都在苏南各地发生了很大影响。
    （七）在宣传、教育之后，应继之以组织各种群众性的爱国活动。游行示威对人民群众有很大教育作用，在城市和农村都应该而且能够进行。在城市还应分别组织各界各业人民的单独示威，而这样的游行队伍本身又是一个宣传队伍。在游行示威的基础上，还要进而组织群众进行写慰问信，捐慰问品，踊跃纳税，纳粮，参军等各种爱国活动，并应使这种活动日新又新。
    （八）签订各界各业各小单位的爱国公约，并加以贯彻实行，是巩固爱国运动成果的好办法。苏南各城镇工商界都订了爱国公约，有的还订了护税公约。目前各行业及更小的单位正继续普遍订立具体的爱国公约，并检查其实行。苏南太仓等县农民在完成土地改革后，也以乡为单位纷纷集会签订爱国公约，他们保证增加生产，缴足公粮，加强民兵活动，严格管制地主，拥军优属做好代耕工作等。
    苏南区抗美援朝爱国运动虽有很大成绩，但目前尚有少数农村根本未发动，运动已经发展的地方一部分又冷了下来。发生这种现象的主要原因是有一部分领导干部滋长了一种满足于一时轰轰烈烈的思想，甚或有了认为应该告一结束的想法。必须纠正这种不正确的想法，使运动更加普遍深入地发展。
