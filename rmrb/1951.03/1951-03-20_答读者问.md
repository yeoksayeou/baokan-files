　　Answers to Readers' Questions
　　I. What is the relationship between trade unions and cooperatives?
　　Comrade Editor:
　　I am a trade union cadre. Because I am not clear about the relationship between cooperatives and trade unions ideologically, conflicts often occur when handling the relationship between trade unions and cooperatives. Please advise: Since cooperatives are independent organizational systems, why is it said that trade unions have the responsibility to supervise cooperatives? If the trade union is not the leading organ of the cooperative, why can it supervise the cooperative?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Lin Gulin
　　Comrade Lin Gulin:
　　According to Article 5 of the Draft Cooperative Law of the People's Republic of China: "Cooperatives are economic organizations voluntarily united by the laboring people to protect their legitimate interests, and are one of the people's organizations with independent organizational systems..." Therefore, the trade union is not the leading organ of the cooperative. It is incorrect for some units to subordinate the cooperative organization system to the trade union welfare department. However, the trade union has the responsibility to supervise the proper operation of the cooperative. Because the members of the cooperative are also members of the trade union, the trade union should supervise the cooperative from the perspective of the economic interests of the trade union members; the trade union can promote the cooperative to better serve its members through suggestions (not orders).

　　II. How to deal with bonds issued by the reactionary government?
　　Comrade Editor:
　　I bought some bonds issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government around the time of the Anti-Japanese War. I don't know whether the People's Government will repay them or make other arrangements. Please reply.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Bi Tianxiu
　　Mr. Bi Tianxiu:
　　The Kuomintang reactionary government issued many bonds in the past. The purpose of their issuing bonds was to exploit the blood and sweat of the people to carry out civil war and massacre the people, or to put them into their private pockets to satisfy their corrupt and indulgent private desires. We sympathize with the suffering of the people in the areas ruled by the Chiang bandits in the past; but the People's Government cannot repay this debt. In the past, the Chiang bandits used this money to suppress the people and consolidate the counter-revolutionary rule; today the people have won, and it is unreasonable to repay this bloody debt for them. If the People's Government were to repay this debt, it would have to rely on the vast number of ordinary people to pay for it. For some people who hold these bonds, it would indeed be compensated, but it would increase the burden on another part of the people, which is also unfair. Therefore, we hope that you can recognize this point, turn your losses into hatred for the evil bandits, and make it a force for liberating Taiwan.

　　答读者问
    一、工会和合作社是怎样的关系？编辑同志：
    我是一个工会的干部。由于思想上对合作社与工会的关系没有闹清楚，所以在处理工会与合作社的关系上，经常发生抵触。请问：合作社既为独立的组织系统，为什么又说工会有监督合作社的责任？如果说工会不是合作社的领导机关，为什么它又可以监督合作社呢？
                  读者  林古林古同志：
    根据中华人民共和国合作社法草案第五条规定：“合作社是劳动人民群众自愿联合起来，保护自己正当利益的经济组织，是具有独立组织系统的人民团体之一……”所以工会不是合作社的领导机关。有些单位将合作社组织系统隶属于工会福利部，是不对的。但工会却有监督把合作社搞好的责任。因为合作社的社员亦为工会的会员，从为工会会员的经济利益出发，应该对合作社进行监督；工会可以通过建议（决不是命令）的方式，促使合作社更好地为社员服务。

  二、反动政府发行的债券如何处理？编辑同志：
    我在抗日战争前后买了一些国民党反动政府发行的债券，我不知道人民政府是否代为付还或作其他的处理，请答复。
            毕天修毕天修先生：
    国民党反动政府过去发行的债券很多，他们发行债券的目的，是为了剥削人民的血汗用来进行内战和屠杀人民，或者是装进他们私人的腰包，满足他们腐化享受的私欲。对过去蒋匪统治区人民所受的这种灾害，我们是同情的；但这笔烂账人民政府不能偿还。过去蒋匪拿这笔钱来镇压人民，巩固反革命统治；今天人民胜利了，还来替他还这笔血腥账，在道理上也是说不通的。如果人民政府要还这笔账，那就得靠广大的老百姓来出钱。对某些持有这批债券的人来说，固然得到补偿，可是因此而增加另一部分人的负担，这也是不公平的事。因此，我们希望你能认识这一点，将你所受的损失，化为对万恶匪帮的痛恨，使之成为解放台湾的力量。
