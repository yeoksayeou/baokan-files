Capital Industrial and Commercial Circles Issue Statements
Endorsing the Regulations on the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries
Calling on Industrial and Commercial Circles to Practice the Patriotic Pact and Strictly Guard Against Special Agents

[This newspaper reported] Figures from the industrial and commercial circles in the capital, including Fu Huating, Liu Yifeng, and Sun Fuling, issued written statements respectively, endorsing the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" recently promulgated by the Central People's Government. In his written statement, Fu Huating stated: "Now that the 'Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries' have been promulgated, we in the industrial and commercial circles not only sincerely and enthusiastically endorse these regulations, but are also determined to unite and strive to implement them." He believes that: "One of the five patriotic covenants of the Beijing industrial and commercial circles is not to listen to the slander of American imperialism and to strictly guard against the activities of special agents. In order to consolidate our political power, this work is the work of the industrialists and businessmen themselves, and industrialists and businessmen should earnestly practice the covenant, eliminate bandits and special agents, and victoriously complete their tasks."

Liu Yifeng stated in his written statement: "Standing from the position of industrialists and businessmen, we firmly support and are willing to assist the government in thoroughly implementing these regulations." He pointed out: "Without the consolidation of revolutionary order, there can be no talk of the development of our cause." Judging from the recent arson incident by special agents in Lingling County, Hunan, as many as 632 shops were burned down! Such a major disaster should be a lesson for the industrial and commercial circles. He also pointed out: "Regarding the prevention of counter-revolutionary activities, some people in the industrial and commercial circles still hold erroneous views of 'sweeping the snow from one's own doorstep' and 'minding one's own business' in their thinking. Now they should raise their vigilance and political acumen, and can no longer be paralyzed and indulgent."

Sun Fuling's written statement believes that: "The fact of the arson incident by special agents in Lingling County, Hunan, shows that internal and external enemies not only vainly attempt to subvert the government of our Chinese people, but also that the lives and property of the people are all objects of their sabotage. They are determined to be enemies of the people." He emphasized: "The industrialists and businessmen in the capital bear a more important responsibility for eliminating bandits and special agents." He said: "We must mobilize employees from every store, factory, enterprise unit, and public organization to assist the government in monitoring controlled elements and suspicious elements at any time, so that bandits and special agents cannot hide and operate in our capital's industrial and commercial circles."

　　首都工商界人士发表谈话
    拥护镇压反革命条例
    号召工商界实践爱国公约严防特务
    【本报讯】首都工商界人士傅华亭、刘一峰、孙孚凌等分别发表书面谈话，拥护中央人民政府最近颁布的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》。傅华亭在书面谈话中称：《惩治反革命条例》公布了，我们工商界对于这项条例不但衷诚热烈地拥护它，而且更决心团结起来，为贯彻这项条例的实施而努力。他认为：北京工商界五项爱国公约中就有不听信美帝国主义的谰言，严防特务活动一项。为了巩固我们的政权，这项工作，是工商业者自己的工作，工商业者，应该切实实践公约，肃清土匪特务，胜利完成自己的任务。
    刘一峰发表书面谈话称：站在工商业者的立场，我们坚决拥护并愿协助政府彻底执行这一条例。他指出：革命秩序不巩固便谈不到我们的事业的发展。就最近湖南零陵县发生的特务纵火事件来看，烧毁的仅商店便有六百三十二户！这样重大的灾害，应该是工商界的经验教训。他并指出：对于防止反革命活动，工商界中若干人在思想上还存有“各扫门前雪”“少管闲事”的错误观点，现在应该提高警惕和政治嗅觉，不能再事麻痹和姑息了。
    孙孚凌的书面谈话认为：湖南零陵县特务纵火这一事实，说明了内外敌人不单妄想颠覆我们中国人民的政府，而且人民的生命财产无一不是他们破坏的对象。他们是坚决与人民为敌的。他强调指出：首都的工商业者对肃清土匪特务负有更重要的责任。他说：我们必须从每个商店、工厂、企业单位、公共团体，动员从业人员随时协助政府监视被管制的分子与可疑分子，使土匪特务无法在我们首都工商业界隐匿与活动。
