　　A Large Number of Fat Pigs in Changbei County Cannot Be Sold
    The County Transportation Station Should Organize Transportation

To the Editor:
    In Changbei County, Liaoxi Province, most farmers engage in pig raising as a sideline production. It is estimated that the county produced approximately 40,000 pigs last year. After deducting the purchases by the county's native produce company and cooperatives, about half must be organized for sale by private merchants to other places. From January to October last year, some were transported and sold by private merchants from other places (mainly Shenyang City) and this county; after October, due to transportation restrictions, private merchants were unwilling to transport them. To this day, a large number of fat pigs in Changbei's rural areas cannot be sold.
    As far as I know, the Changbei County Transportation Station of the Liaoxi Province Transportation Company has many rubber-wheeled carts, and business is very slow due to the large number of carts and the lack of goods. If this transportation capacity is organized, it can solve the transportation difficulties of native produce sales. Of course, the freight rates for the carts will be higher, but if the interests of production, transportation, and sales can be considered and resolved through mutual consultation, it will be beneficial to everyone.

    Editor's Note: Reader Qiu Shenjie's suggestion is very good. In order to solve the current difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity in material exchange, it is necessary to organize mass transportation, which is an experience proven in many areas of North China. Since Changbei County has a large number of idle rubber-wheeled carts, they should be organized to participate in transportation, which will be beneficial to production, sales, and transportation.

### 昌北县大批肥猪无法外销  该县运输站应组织运输

　　昌北县大批肥猪无法外销
    该县运输站应组织运输编辑同志：
    辽西省昌北县多数农户都以养猪为副业生产。据估计，去年该县约共产猪四万只，除由本县土产公司、合作社收购外，尚余二分之一必须组织私商外销。在去年一月至十月间，有外地（主要是沈阳市）及本县私商运销一部；十月以后，由于运输条件的限制，私商都不愿意贩运了。至今昌北农村尚有大批肥猪无法外销。
    据我所知，辽西省运输公司昌北县运输站的胶轮大车很多，因车多货少，生意非常清淡。如果把这批运输力组织起来，是可以解决土产外销的运输困难的。当然，大车的运费会要高一些，但如果能本着产、运、销三者利益兼顾的原则，互相协商解决，对大家都是有利的。
                                      读者  丘申节
    编者按：读者丘申节的意见很好。为了解决目前物资交流中运输力不足的困难，必须组织群众性的运输，这是华北许多地区证明了的经验。昌北县既有大批胶轮大车空闲，就应当组织起来参加运输，这对产、销、运三者都是有利的。
