    Huai'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Has Work Plans
    Prepares Early to Supply Farmers with Agricultural Tools and Fertilizer
    Editor:
    In order to ensure that its members can carry out spring plowing and sowing in a timely manner this year, the Huai'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Chahar Province learned from last year's lesson of temporary scrambling, and prepared a large number of agricultural tools, pesticides, and fertilizers early to supply its members. The agricultural tools include more than 1,300 iron shovels, which were made after signing a contract with local blacksmiths to ensure quality and specifications. Stamps were also printed on the products so that they can be returned to the original manufacturers if they are not suitable or of poor quality. The pesticides were purchased by the county cooperative in early January by sending a special person to Yu County. In accordance with the government's plan to reward the planting of special cash crops, the cooperative purchased 3,600 jin of white sesame seeds and distributed them to its members. It also obtained a fertilizer loan of 56 million yuan from the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and purchased 240,000 jin of dried manure. These fertilizers and agricultural tools were allocated after cadres from the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to the countryside in groups to help the village cooperatives investigate the needs of the masses.

    怀安县供销合作社工作有计划
    提早准备农具肥料供应社员编辑同志：
    察哈尔省怀安县供销合作社为保证社员今年能够及时春耕播种，接受了去年临时抓一把的教训，提早准备了大批农具、农药、肥料以供应社员。农具计有铁锨一千三百多张，是与当地铁匠炉订好保证质量与规格的合同后作的，并在产品上加印戳记，以便不合用或质量不好时找原制者退换。农药是在一月初由县合作社派专人到蔚县去买回的。又根据政府奖励栽种特种经济作物的计划，合作社购回白麻籽三千六百斤分配给社员。并通过省供销合作社拨给五千六百万元的肥料贷款，购回大粪干二十四万斤。这些肥料、农具是由县供销合作社干部分组下乡，帮助各村合作社调查群众需求情况后，才配贷下去的。
