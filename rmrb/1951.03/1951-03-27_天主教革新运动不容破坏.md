Catholic Reform Movement Must Not Be Sabotaged
Fan Daojiang, Priest of the Catholic Diocese of Nanchong, Sichuan

Editor's Note: This article is an excerpt of an article published by Fan Daojiang, a priest of the Catholic Diocese of Nanchong, Sichuan, in the "North Sichuan Daily" on March 7th.

Just as representatives of religious circles from more than 30 cities and counties in the North Sichuan District were holding a symposium in Nanchong to resist US aggression and aid Korea, a reactionary document entitled "Study Reference" was sent from the Catholic Church Affairs Committee on Yueyang Road, Shanghai. The content of this document contradicts our Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

That reactionary document stated that the Catholic Church has never had any relationship with imperialism. However, historically speaking, imperialism has consistently used the Church to carry out aggression against the Chinese people. For example, US imperialism forced the construction of churches in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, Shanghai, and other places in the Treaty of Wangxia. At the reform symposium of religious representatives in the North Sichuan District, many church members accused missionaries from imperialist countries of many acts that violated the interests of the Chinese people. Who can say that the Church has had no contact with imperialism? The document stated: the Church is already autonomous. However, Catholicism has been introduced into China for more than 300 years, and even now, the management rights of nearly 100 dioceses are entirely in the hands of foreigners. In order to use the Church for their political purposes for a long time, they have always held on to them. That reactionary document also stated: the Church does not accept funding from domestic or foreign sources with political backgrounds. However, US imperialism's spokesman, Austin, openly admitted that a large portion of the Church's expenses in China are supplied by the United States. Isn't this accepting funding from foreign sources with political backgrounds? Today, we want to reform, cut off economic ties with imperialism, which also means that we are practicing self-support for the love of our motherland and the Church, and we will not be bought off by imperialist money. That reactionary document also stated: foreign missionaries preach purely from the Church's standpoint and for the benefit of the local Church, and do not work for the benefit of foreign countries. However, many facts prove that many foreign missionaries work for the benefit of imperialism. For example, American imperialist elements Ke Yide and Su Xuezhen, disguised as "missionaries" at the Fujiang Women's Middle School, secretly set up radio receivers in their residences, drew maps of Suining and Tibet, and used the Church's "Women's Service Association" to investigate the climate of various provinces in China. This fully proves that they used Church relations to carry out many political activities that violated the interests of the Chinese people. Is this "preaching for the benefit of the local Church," or is it working for the benefit of the aggressors?

Our religious reform movement is an act of loving the motherland and is welcomed by the people of the whole country. The reactionary document "Study Reference" completely stands on the side of imperialism and intentionally sabotages our Catholic reform movement.

　　天主教革新运动不容破坏
    天主教四川南充教区神父  范导江
    编者按：本文为天主教四川南充教区神父范导江三月七日在川北日报上发表的一篇文章的摘要。
    正当川北区三十余市、县的宗教界代表在南充召开抗美援朝座谈会的时候，由上海岳阳路天主教教务委员会寄来了名为“学习参考”的反动文件。该文件的内容，和我们的三自运动是相抵触的。
    在那个反动文件里说，天主教与任何帝国主义未发生过关系。但我们从历史上来看，帝国主义是一贯利用教会对中国人民进行侵略的。例如美帝国主义在望厦条约中强迫要在我广州、福州、厦门、宁波、上海等地建筑礼拜堂。在我们川北区宗教界代表革新座谈会上，各教友曾控诉出不少的帝国主义国家的传教士不少违反中国人民利益的事实。谁能说教会和帝国主义没有发生过联系呢？该项文件说：教会已是自治的。然而天主教传入中国已三百余年，到现在还有近百个教区的管理权全操在外国人之手。他们为了长期利用教会达到其政治目的，始终把持不放。在那反动的文件里又说：教会不接受国内外有政治背景的资助，然而美帝国主义代言人奥斯汀却公开招认：在中国的教会中有很大一部分经费是由美国供给的。这不是接受外国有政治背景的资助是什么？今天我们要革新了，割断和帝国主义的经济关系，也就表示我们为爱祖国、爱教会而实行自养，不受帝国主义的金钱收买。在那个反动文件里又说：外籍传教士纯以教会的立场为本地教会的利益而传教，不为外籍的利益而工作。然而许多事实证明：很多外国传教士，是为着帝国主义的利益而工作的。如在涪江女子中学披着“传教士”外衣的美帝国主义分子克依德、苏学真等，在住宅里私设无线电收报机，绘制遂宁和西藏地图，并利用教会的“妇女服务会”调查中国各省的气候，这就充分证明了他们利用教会关系作了很多违反中国人民利益的政治活动。这究竟是“为本地教会利益而传教”呢，还是在为侵略者利益而工作呢？
    我们宗教界的革新运动是爱祖国的行动，是受到全国人民欢迎的。“学习参考”那个反动文件是完全站在帝国主义立场上有意破坏我们天主教的革新运动的。
