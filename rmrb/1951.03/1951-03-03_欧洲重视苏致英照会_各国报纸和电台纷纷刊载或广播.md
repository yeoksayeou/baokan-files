　　Xinhua News Agency, February 28th dispatch: The Soviet government's note of February 24th, condemning Britain's violation of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, has received great attention throughout Europe. Many newspapers and radio stations in various countries published or broadcast the full text or summaries of the Soviet note on the 26th.

　　In the People's Democracies, Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo," Poland's "Trybuna Ludu," "Życie Warszawy," "Sztandar Młodych," and the German Democratic Republic's "Berliner Zeitung" all prominently featured the Soviet note with large headlines. Romania's only Monday publication, Bucharest's "Capital Life," also published the full text of the note. There were no newspapers published in Czechoslovakia that day, but Prague Radio broadcast a detailed summary of the note twice. In addition, Bucharest Radio broadcast the full text of the note twice, and Hungarian Radio broadcast a summary of the note three times. The Hungarian Telegraph Agency also forwarded the full text of the note.

　　In Western Europe, all London newspapers and many Paris newspapers published news of the Soviet reply to Britain. London's "Daily Worker" and Paris's "L'Humanité" both published detailed excerpts from the note.

　　The "Daily Worker's" diplomatic correspondent, commenting on the Soviet note, emphasized the facts in the note regarding the demobilization of Soviet troops and the British, American, and French arms expansion movements. The paper pointed out that all this exposed the lies in the Anglo-American statements about the size of Soviet armed forces.

　　"L'Humanité's" editorial pointed out that the Soviet government's note is the most prominent piece of real evidence, proving that the British government's current policy is in violation of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. The editorial stated: "No one can deny that the British government's current policy, like the French government's current policy, is a blatant violation of the provisions and spirit of the treaties concluded between the Soviet Union and these countries when France and Britain fought alongside the Soviet Union against a common enemy." The editorial also sharply pointed out: "Abandoning the policy of alliance with the Soviet Union forces these countries to move towards the Atlantic Alliance, the pillar of which is yesterday's enemies—the German imperialists; this alliance is directed against the allies who fought against these enemies during the last war."

　　An editorial in Poland's "Życie Warszawy," commenting on the Soviet government's note to the British government, pointed out: The British government's note of February 17 to the Soviet government fully confirms Stalin's words, namely that Prime Minister Attlee needs lies to slander the Soviet Union in order to "deceive the British people, and use this slander of the Soviet Union to trick them, thereby using deceptive means to drag them into the new world war being arranged by the ruling group of the United States of America." However, despite the British government's slander, the British people are increasingly dissatisfied with Attlee and Bevin's policies. The paper stated: The Soviet note will undoubtedly be understood by the British working people and promote the deepening of friendship between the British and Soviet peoples, which neither Attlee nor his Washington masters can prevent.

　　欧洲重视苏致英照会
    各国报纸和电台纷纷刊载或广播
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社讯：苏联政府二月二十四日谴责英国破坏英苏条约的照会受到全欧洲的极大重视。各国许多报纸与电台均于二十六日刊出或广播了苏联照会的全文或摘要。
    在各人民民主国家，保加利亚的《劳动报》、波兰的《人民论坛报》、《华沙报》、《兹坦达·姆洛地茨报》、德意志民主共和国的《柏林晚报》，均在显著地位以大字标题刊出了苏联照会，罗马尼亚唯一在星期一出版的布加勒斯特《首都生活报》也刊出了照会全文。捷克斯洛伐克这天没有报纸出版，但布拉格电台将照会详细节要广播了两次。此外，布加勒斯特电台将照会全文广播了两次，匈牙利电台把照会节要广播了三次。匈牙利电讯社并把照会全文转发。
    在西欧，伦敦所有的报纸与巴黎许多报纸都刊出了苏联复照英国的新闻。伦敦《工人日报》与巴黎《人道报》都把照会详细摘录发表。
    《工人日报》外交记者在评论苏联照会时，着重举出照会中关于苏联军队复员及英、美、法三国扩军运动的事实。该报指出，这一切揭穿了英美声明中关于苏联武装力量数字的谎言。
    《人道报》社论指出，苏联政府的照会是最突出的一种真凭实据，它证明英国政府现行政策是违反英苏条约的。社论称：“没有一个人能够否认，英国政府的现行政策，和法国政府的现行政策一样，是很露骨地违反了当法国和英国与苏联并肩作战反对共同敌人时期，苏联与这些国家所缔结的那些条约的条文与精神的。”社论并尖锐地指出：“抛弃与苏联联盟的政策，就使这些国家非走向大西洋联盟不可，这种联盟的支柱就是昨天的敌人——德国帝国主义者们；这种联盟所针对的就是上次大战期间曾对这些敌人作战的盟国。”
    波兰《华沙生活报》社论评论苏联政府致英国政府的照会时指出：英国政府二月十七日致苏联政府的照会，充分证实了斯大林的话，即艾德礼首相需要诽谤苏联的谎言，以便“迷惑英国人民，用这种诽谤苏联的谎言来哄骗他们，从而用欺骗手段把他们卷入美利坚合众国统治集团所正在安排的新的世界战争中”。然而，尽管英国政府进行诽谤，英国人民却日益对艾德礼与贝文的政策表示不满。该报称：苏联的照会无疑地将获得英国劳动人民的了解，并促进英、苏两国人民友谊的加深，这种友谊不论是艾德礼或者是他的华盛顿主子都无法加以阻碍的。
