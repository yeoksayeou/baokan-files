Xinhua News Agency, March 17th Dispatch: According to Tass and Dentsu dispatches citing Paris newspapers: Despite the Franco gang's exhaustive and brutal suppression, thousands of workers in Spain were still continuing their strike as of the 16th.  The Franco gang, realizing that military pressure alone could not force all workers back to work, threatened to close down two currently striking factories in New Pablo and Badalona, near Barcelona.  The frenzied suppression of strikers is continuing.  In addition to the continued arrest of workers by the military police, many factories have begun to dismiss striking workers en masse since the 14th; in the Olivetti factory alone, 200 workers have been fired. A special court has been established in Barcelona to try striking workers. The Franco cabinet also met again on the 16th to study measures to suppress the workers. However, according to L'Humanité, "The heroic people of Barcelona are bravely resisting intensified suppression."

Terrified by the heroic struggle of the Spanish people, American imperialism, after dispatching a large number of air force personnel to Barcelona on the 14th, sent 1,600 Marines to Gibraltar on the 15th under the pretext of conducting "amphibious warfare training," vainly attempting to intimidate the Spanish people who had already ignited the flames of resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th Dispatch: The general strike of 300,000 workers in Barcelona, Spain, heroically resisting the Franco regime, has won the sympathy and support of people in various European countries. In Italy, Rossi, chairman of the Italian Women's League, sent a telegram on behalf of all Italian democratic women to Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party, expressing respect. The Executive Committee of the All-Italy Guerrilla Association also sent a telegram to the Spanish people to pay tribute. Workers in factories in Venice, Genoa, and other Italian cities, as well as representatives of 25,000 tenant farmers in Bologna province, successively held meetings and passed resolutions to cheer for the struggle of the Spanish people. In Ancona and other cities, workers held flash strikes in support of the Spanish people. In Naples, students held protest demonstrations in front of the Franco consulate.

In France, after the French Communist Party passed a resolution on the 13th to pay tribute to the workers in Barcelona, ​​FCP member of parliament Billoux (formerly translated as Biraud) spoke in the National Assembly to congratulate the Spanish strikers. When he shouted, "Salute the glorious Spanish people against the war," all the Communist members of parliament stood up and shouted in unison, "Long live the Spanish Republic!" The applause lasted for several minutes. The traditional militant friendship between French and Spanish workers is so deep that even the Seine department's local organization of the Socialist Party and the Socialist trade union "Workers' Force" had to express support for the Spanish workers and condemn Franco's brutal suppression of the people.

In the Netherlands, the working people warmly praised the heroic struggle of the Spanish people and angrily protested Franco's atrocities in suppressing the people. Workers in Amsterdam held a general meeting and passed a telegram of condolence to the working people of Barcelona, ​​stating that Dutch workers would stand behind the Spanish freedom fighters.

In Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front's "Izgrev" published an article on the 16th entitled "Salute to the Strikers of Barcelona," expressing the Bulgarian people's support for the Spanish workers' peaceful struggle.

　　不顾佛朗哥匪帮疯狂镇压
    西班牙工人坚持罢工
    欧洲人民纷向罢工工人致敬
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社与电通社引巴黎报纸消息：在佛朗哥匪帮用尽残酷的镇压手段以后，西班牙迄十六日止，仍有数千工人在继续罢工。佛朗哥匪帮鉴于施用军事压力都不能使工人全部复工，已威胁着要封闭巴塞罗那附近新巴布罗和巴达隆纳两地现在罢工中的两个工厂。对罢工者的疯狂镇压正在继续进行中。除军警继续逮捕工人外，许多工厂自十四日起开始大批开除罢工工人，单在奥利维第工厂中，即有二百名工人解雇。巴塞罗那已成立特别法庭，审判罢工工人。佛朗哥内阁并曾于十六日再度集议，研究镇压工人的措施。但是，据人道报报道：“英勇的巴塞罗那人民正在勇敢地对抗变本加厉的镇压”。
    为西班牙人民的英勇斗争吓慌了的美国帝国主义，继十四日派遣大批空军进驻巴塞罗那以后，又于十五日派遣一千六百名海军陆战队抵达直布罗陀，以进行“两栖作战训练”为借口，妄想威吓已经燃起了反抗烈火的西班牙人民。
    【新华社十七日讯】西班牙巴塞罗那三十万工人英勇反抗佛朗哥统治的总罢工，博得了欧洲各国人民的同情声援。在意大利，意大利妇女联盟主席罗西，代表全意民主妇女致电西班牙共产党总书记多洛列斯·伊巴露丽表示敬意。全意游击队协会执委会亦电西班牙人民致敬。威尼斯、热那亚和其他意大利城市工厂的工人，以及波伦亚省二万五千佃农的代表，先后集会通过决议，为西班牙人民的斗争欢呼。在安科纳与其他城市，工人们举行了声援西班牙人民的闪电罢工。在那不勒斯，学生们在佛朗哥的领事馆前举行了抗议示威。
    在法国，继法国共产党十三日通过决议向巴塞罗那工人致敬之后，法共议员比佑（前译比劳）在国民议会中发言祝贺西班牙的罢工者。当他高呼：“向反对战争的光荣的西班牙人民致敬”时，全体共产党议员都站起来，齐声欢呼“西班牙共和国万岁！”鼓掌达数分钟不息。法国工人与西班牙工人之间传统的战斗友谊是如此深厚，甚至社会党的赛纳省地方机构，与社会党工会“工人力量”都不得不表示支持西班牙工人，并斥责佛朗哥对人民的残酷镇压行为。
    在荷兰，劳动人民热烈赞扬西班牙人民的英勇斗争，并愤怒地抗议佛朗哥镇压人民的暴行。阿姆斯特丹工人举行大会，通过了致巴塞罗那劳动人民的慰问电，其中表示荷兰工人决为西班牙自由斗士的后盾。
    在保加利亚，祖国阵线的《伊兹格列夫报》于十六日以“向巴塞罗那罢工者致敬”为题，撰文表示保加利亚人民对西班牙工人和平斗争的声援。
