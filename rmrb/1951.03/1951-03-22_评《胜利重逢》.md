Review of "Reunion After Victory"
    Hou Jinjing
    The film uses the contrast between the lives of the people under the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the lives of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, and the lives of the people in the liberated areas as its subject matter. Through the experience of a peasant in these two realms, two worlds, it depicts the process of his ideological growth and improvement. It portrays a soldier of peasant origin, under the leadership, education, and inspiration of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, expressing his heartfelt voice: "The Communist Party is like the sun; wherever it goes, there is light." He continues to advance bravely and eliminate the enemy.
    It expresses, from one aspect, how the People's Liberation War achieved victory, and the anti-feudal revolutionary forces accumulated by the peasant class. This theme, in the past and today, is a very important theme for artistic creation.
    When the protagonist, Geng Hailin, was in the Kuomintang reactionary army, he had a sense of justice and sympathized with those who were wronged. After being forcibly conscripted, he longed for his family and labor. However, under the heavy pressure of the reactionaries, he failed. His past dreams of life became his greatest pain. This illustrates the potential revolutionary power accumulated by the peasants, while also pointing out that peasants can only achieve liberation by engaging in armed struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    However, this film, because it places its main emphasis on the contrast between the two realms, relaxes the deeper depiction of Geng Hailin's inner self, causing the thread of Geng Hailin's ideological development to be interrupted before and after liberation. His past resistance to the landlord class seems to have been weakened by the years in the Kuomintang army. Most importantly, the film consistently fails to further depict the growth of Geng Hailin's class hatred, instead focusing excessively on the general life of the Kuomintang army, which makes it impossible to delve deeper into the depiction of Geng Hailin's mental state. At the same time, the film does not depict how changes in the environment led to changes in his thinking (although it writes about his dissatisfaction with the Kuomintang army's looting of grain and shooting of sick soldiers, these are only external stimuli, and inner contradictions are rarely expressed). This affects his rapid transformation after liberation, depriving him of a more powerful basis for becoming a combat hero.
    Precisely because of the above reasons, the ideological fluctuations and transformations that Geng Hailin experienced in the People's Liberation Army cannot be deeply moving. The conflict unfolded in the film is that Geng Hailin's inner struggle arose because he broke an iron pot belonging to the masses and was severely criticized by another soldier. In essence, this is secondary, a trivial matter. The main thing should be the struggle between narrow interests and collectivism—Geng Hailin's personal revenge and the idea that working people all over the world are one family, defeating Chiang Kai-shek and liberating all of China. Because the problem is not explored and solved from Geng Hailin's class essence, the activeness of the theme is weakened; on the other hand, it cannot strongly express the power of political work in the army, only describing the care and concern of the squad leader and soldiers for his life, without inspiring his class consciousness. This is not entirely in line with the real situation in the army.
    This involves a very important issue in today's creative thinking: is it to solve the ideological problems of soldiers based on the narrow interests of peasants, or to combine personal interests with the overall war goals and the overall interests, give soldiers far-reaching and beautiful ideals, and raise soldiers' consciousness to the level of patriotism? The former expression method is one-sided and not a complete realistic creation method, so as time passes, the work loses its luster and becomes outdated. The latter can achieve a greater impact, not only solving ideological problems, but also enabling the audience to gain confidence and strength from the work to encourage themselves to move forward. Although this film once depicted the words "Revolution to the End" embroidered on the needlework bag that Geng Hailin's wife gave him, and the Liu Jiamao Village masses presented the army with a banner reading "Fight to Taiwan to Liberate All of China," because it did not permeate Geng Hailin's ideological growth process, it became conceptually weak.
    Finally, I feel that the arrangement of the battle scenes shows the stubbornness of the enemy, and can better show our invincible power and vividly show Geng Hailin's heroic behavior. This is still considered a success in artistic technique.

　　评《胜利重逢》
    侯金镜
    影片以蒋匪反动统治下的人民生活、蒋匪军的生活与解放区人民生活对比为题材，通过一个农民在这两种天下，两个世界的经历，写出他的思想的成长和提高的过程，写出农民出身的战士，在中国共产党和中国人民解放军的领导教育感召下面，发出自己的心声：“共产党像太阳，他到那儿那儿亮”，继续勇猛前进，消灭敌人。
    从一个侧面来表现人民解放战争怎样取得胜利，表现农民阶级蕴蓄的反封建的革命力量。这个主题，在过去，在今天都是艺术创作的一个很重要的主题。
    主人公耿海林在国民党反动军队里的时候，他有正义感，同情那些受屈的同伴；被抓丁的抓去以后，他怀念着家庭，怀念着劳动，但是在反动派重压之下，他失败了，过去对生活的梦想，对他成了最大的痛苦。这说明了。农民蕴蓄的潜在的革命力量，同时又指出了农民只有在共产党领导下进行武装斗争才能获得解放。
    但是这个影片由于把主要力量放在两个天下的对比上，放松了对耿海林这人物的内心作更深一步的刻划，使耿海林的思想发展线索在解放的前后中断了；过去对地主阶级的反抗性，在国民党部队的几年生活中，似乎是被折磨得更微弱了。而最重要的是始终没有进一步写出耿海林的阶级仇恨的增长，却过分着力在对国民党军队一般的生活的描写，就使得对耿海林精神状态的描写不能再深入。同时影片没有写出，环境的变化引起他思想上的变化（虽然写了一些他对国民党部队抢粮，枪杀生病的士兵的不满，但也只是一些外在的刺激，内心的矛盾表现得是很少的），这样就影响到他在解放以后的迅速转变，使他能够成为战斗英雄也失去了更有力的根据。
    也正是由于以上原因，使耿海林在人民解放军中间所产生的思想波动和转变，不能深切感人。影片中展开的矛盾是耿海林因为打破了一个群众的铁锅受到另一个战士的严厉批评而产生了内心斗争。实质上这是次要的，是一个细枝末节；主要的应该是狭隘的利益与集体主义——耿海林个人的复仇思想和天下劳动人民是一家，打败蒋介石解放全中国的思想的斗争。由于没有从耿海林的阶级本质上来发掘问题和解决问题，也就削弱了主题的积极性；另一方面也就不能强烈地表现出部队政治工作的力量，只描写了班长、战士对他生活上的关切和照顾，没有启发他的阶级自觉，这是不完全符合部队的真实情况的。
    这就涉及到今天在创作思想上的一个很重要的问题，是就着农民的狭隘的利益来解决战士的思想问题呢，还是把个人的利益与整个战争目的相结合，与整体利益相结合，给战士以远大和美满的理想，把战士的觉悟提高到爱国主义的水平？前者的表现方法是有片面性的，不是完整的现实主义的创作方法，所以时过境迁，使作品失去了光采，成了过时的东西；而后者则能够取得更巨大的影响，不只是解决了思想问题，而且能够使观众从作品中取得鼓舞自己前进的信心和力量。这一影片虽曾在几个镜头中描写耿海林妻子给他的针线包上绣了“革命到底”的字样，和刘家茆村群众送给部队“打到台湾去解放全中国”的锦旗，但由于没有沁透到耿海林的思想成长的过程里去，也就成了概念无力的了。
    最后，我觉得在战斗场面的安排上，表现了敌人的顽强，更能表现我们无坚不摧的力量而且形象地表现了耿海林的英雄行为。这在艺术技巧上还算是成功的。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（编者按：这部影片将于明日公映）
