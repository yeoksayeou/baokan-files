Publishing News

    Rural Publishing Work of Hebei People's Publishing House
    It is correct and necessary for Hebei People's Publishing House to publish a large number of publications for rural readers, as a specialized direction. Last year, the publishing house published 112 new books, with more than 1,340,000 copies printed. Generally speaking, the promotion volume is not high enough. Among them, books such as "Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Materials," "Rural Practical Writing," "How to Run a Supply and Marketing Cooperative," "A Reader's Guide to the New Marriage Law," and "Complete Collection of Couplets" have the largest sales volume, with "Rural Practical Writing" selling 44,000 copies. This year, the publishing house plans to publish 200 books, with 2,300,000 copies printed. The books that have been published or are about to be published include "Illustrated New Characters for Farming," "Illustrated New Characters for Rural Daily Use," "Introduction to Simple Abacus," "200 Questions on Natural Science," "Answers to Common Sense of Natural Science," "How Soviet Youth Love Their Motherland," "The American Ruling Class in Chaos and Division," as well as scripts, comic strips, and song collections.
    Strengthening publishing work for farmers is very important. Our publishing industry still lacks complete experience in this regard. It is hoped that Hebei People's Publishing House will contact a wide range of readers through publications, conduct surveys on readers' interests and acceptance capabilities, and study a set of experiences.

    Publishing Comic Strips in Publications for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Many publications for workers, peasants, and soldiers often publish comic strips, with good content, skills, and printing, attracting more readers and thus promoting sales. Such publications include "Worker's Home" in Northeast China, "Worker Culture" in Tianjin, and "Beijing Worker" in Beijing among worker publications; "New Rural Areas" in Northeast China and "Hebei Rural Areas" in Baoding among farmer publications; "Mass Art" in Northeast China and "Mass Art" in Shanghai among popular literature and art; and "Inner Mongolia Pictorial" in Zhangjiakou, "Locomotive Pictorial" in Northeast China, and "Soldier Pictorial" of the Fourth Field Army among pictorials. However, some publications for workers, peasants, and soldiers have not done so, or have not done so well. At present, there is no journal that mainly focuses on comic strips. The publication of such a journal is very necessary at present, and it will definitely be welcomed by the vast number of worker and peasant readers.

    Historical Materials on "The Boxer Rebellion"
    "The Boxer Rebellion," a volume in the Series of Historical Materials on Modern Chinese History edited by the China New Historical Research Association, has been published. The book is over 2,000 pages, divided into four volumes, containing 48 kinds of historical materials, of which three are compiled. It is appended with "Annotations to the Bibliography of the Boxer Rebellion" written by Jian Bozan, the editor-in-chief of the book, which is very convenient for researchers. This series is published by Shenzhou Guoguang Society.

    "Teacher's Monthly" Launched
    This is a publication aimed at educational workers in Beijing, with the aim of promoting education, improving the quality of education, and exchanging learning and professional experience. The inaugural issue includes Zeng Zhaolun's "Natural Science Teaching and Patriotic Education," Ding Haochuan's "Several Opinions on Patriotic Education in Primary Schools," and Wang Yimin's "Carrying out Patriotic Education in Secondary Schools" and other papers. In addition, articles on teachers' learning occupy a considerable portion, and there is also a column for "Abstracts and Indexes" of educational papers. Promoting patriotism in educational publications and guiding primary and secondary school teachers on how to infuse the spirit of patriotism into education are issues that all educational publications should pay attention to. The current primary and secondary school textbooks do not do enough in expounding patriotism. It is hoped that "Teacher's Monthly" and other educational publications can combine textbooks and publish articles and lesson plans related to patriotic education in a planned manner based on specific subjects.

    Strengthen Publicity on the Trade Union Law
    On March 4, the New Hunan Daily published three articles on the front page in a prominent position about the inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law in Changsha, Hengyang, and other places, pointing out that the phenomenon of ignoring and violating the Trade Union Law was very serious and widespread in various places. The inspection results showed that "many employees, the masses, the Party, the government, trade unions, administrative cadres, and capitalists still do not fully understand that the Trade Union Law is a national law." The New Hunan Daily published an editorial entitled "Correct Understanding of the Trade Union Law," criticizing the incorrect understanding of the Trade Union Law prevalent among a few government cadres, administrative cadres of public enterprises, capitalists of private enterprises, and some grass-roots trade union cadres and workers, hoping to "launch a widespread and in-depth movement to re-study the Trade Union Law and correct understanding of the Trade Union Law."
    The phenomena found in Changsha and Hengyang also exist in other places. Newspapers should publish these materials and supervise all parties to correctly implement the Trade Union Law. At present, some newspapers, including some workers' newspapers, do not promote the Trade Union Law enough. They have published materials about capitalists rudely violating and undermining the Trade Union Law, and cadres only taking insufficient measures such as "persuasion" and "criticism" to deal with this situation. The newspapers have not expressed their attitude, and this phenomenon should be corrected.

    Inappropriate Challenges
    The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao published a news item on March 4, reporting that the grass-roots organization of the Shanghai Textile Trade Union Handkerchief Factory, after accepting the commission of the Municipal Trading Company to process socks, put forward four conditions to "challenge textile workers in the city," the first of which was "85% of wages." A similar news appeared in the Xinwen Daily on March 10. Many departments of Shanghai Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory signed patriotic covenants, one of which was "extending production time to improve production quality."
    Such challenges and covenants are inappropriate. At present, it is not necessary to ask workers to reduce wages. Even if the wages of handkerchief workers can be appropriately reduced, it is definitely not appropriate to use it to "challenge textile workers in the city." As for extending production time, it may not necessarily improve production quality, and such patriotic covenants may cause adverse results such as harming workers' health. Newspapers should pay attention not to publish inappropriate challenges and covenants, and should help workers correct this mistake.

　　出版动态
    河北人民出版社的农村出版工作
    河北省人民出版社大量出版以农村读者为对象的出版物，这种专业方向是正确和必要的。该社去年一年共出版新书一一二种，印行一百三十四万多册，一般说，推广量还不够高。其中以《抗美援朝宣传资料》、《农村应用文》、《怎样办供销社》、《新婚姻法读本》、《对联大全》等书销数最大，《农村应用文》已销四万四千册。该社今年计划出书二百种，印二百三十万册，已出版或即将出版者有《绘图庄稼新字》、《绘图农村日用新字》、《简易珠算入门》、《自然科学二百问》、《自然科学常识解答》、《苏联青年怎样热爱他们的祖国》、《美国统治阶级在混乱与分裂中》及剧本、连环画、歌集等。
    加强对农民的出版工作是很重要的，我们出版界在这方面还缺少完整的经验，希望河北人民出版社通过出版物联系广泛的读者，进行读者兴趣和接受能力等的调查，研究出一套经验来。
            在工农兵刊物中刊载连环画
    有很多工农兵刊物，经常刊载连环画，内容、技巧、印刷也都好，吸引了更多的读者，因而推广了销路。这样的刊物，在工人刊物中如东北的《工人之家》、天津的《工人文化》、北京的《北京工人》，在农民刊物中如东北的《新农村》、保定的《河北农村》；在通俗文艺中如东北的《群众文艺》、上海的《群众文艺》；在画报中如张家口的《内蒙画报》、东北的《火车头画刊》、第四野战军的《战士画报》，都做得很好。但有些工农兵刊物还没有这样做，或做得还不大好。现在期刊界还没有专以连环画为主要内容的刊物，这种刊物的出版，在目前很有必要，它一定能受到广大工农读者的欢迎。
            《义和团》的史料
    中国新史学研究会主编的中国近代史资料丛刊已有《义和团》一种出版。全书印二千余面，分四卷，包含史料四十八种，其中有三种是辑录成的，末附本书主编翦伯赞所撰《义和团书目题解》，极便于研究者，这套丛书由神州国光社出版。
            《教师月报》创刊
    这是以北京市教育工作者为对象的刊物，它以推进教育工作、提高教育质量、交流学习和业务经验为要旨。创刊号里有曾昭抡的《自然科学教学与爱国主义教育》、丁浩川的《关于小学爱国主义教育的几点意见》、王宜民的《开展中等学校的爱国主义教育》等论文。此外谈教师学习的文字占不少篇幅，又有教育论文“文摘、索引”一栏。在教育刊物中宣传爱国主义，指导中小学教师如何在教育中贯注爱国主义的精神，这是一切教育刊物应该注意的问题。目前的中小学教科书，在阐发爱国主义上都做得不够，希望《教师月报》及其他教育刊物，能结合教材，根据具体科目，有计划地发表一些有关爱国主义教育的文章与教案。
            加强工会法的宣传
    新湖南报三月四日在第一版以显著地位发表了长沙、衡阳等地检查工会法执行情形的三篇稿件，指出各地漠视和违反工会法的现象很严重、很普遍，检查的结果显示“好些职工群众、党、政府、工会和行政干部及资方仍对工会法是国家大法这一点领会不够。”新湖南报发表了题为《端正对工会法的认识》的社论，批判了流行于少数政府干部、公营企业行政干部、私营企业资方以及一些基层工会干部和工人群众中的对工会法的一些不正确的认识，希望“掀起一个广泛而又深入的重新学习工会法运动，端正对工会法的认识”。
    在长沙和衡阳所检查出来的那些现象，在其他各地也是存在的，报纸应该发表这些材料，监督各方面正确地执行工会法。目前还有一些报纸，包括某些工人报纸，对于工会法的宣传不够，发表了一些资方粗暴地违反和破坏工会法，以及干部对这种情形只限于采取“说服”“批评”等不充分的处理方法的材料，报纸并没有表示态度，这种现象是应该注意纠正的。
            不适当的挑战
    上海大公报三月四日发表了一条新闻，报道上海市纺织工会手机工厂基层组织在接受市贸易公司委托加工织袜后，提出四项条件，“向全市纺织工人挑战”，其第一项条件就是“工资八五折”。同一性质的消息出现在三月十日新闻日报的新闻中，上海同丰印染厂许多部门订立了爱国公约，其内容之一是“延长生产时间，借以提高生产质量”。
    这样的挑战和公约是不适当的。在目前没有必要叫工人减少工资，即使手机工人的工资还可以适当降低，也决不适宜拿来“向全市纺织工人挑战”。至于延长生产时间也并不一定能真正提高生产质量，这样的爱国公约会引起妨害工人健康等不良的结果。报纸上应注意不要发表不适当的挑战公约。并应帮助工人纠正这种错误。
