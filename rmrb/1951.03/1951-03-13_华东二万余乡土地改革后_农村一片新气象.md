After the completion of land reform in over 22,000 townships in East China, the enthusiasm of farmers for labor and production has soared, and their lives have gradually improved, presenting a new atmosphere in the countryside.

Farmers who have been allocated land deeply believe that "as long as people are diligent, manure can turn into gold," and everyone is working hard to produce. In the past, wheat and rapeseed fields were only weeded once, but now they are generally weeded three times. They actively collect manure, dig pond mud, raise livestock, and plow and hoe early, preparing for the spring farming and great production, turning the winter slack into a busy winter. In Chongtang Township, Kunshan County, 210 farmers organized manure collection teams to collect manure. Gou Lihe, a family member of a revolutionary soldier in Beiyang Village, Weibei County, went to the streets and alleys early and late to collect manure, and has already collected more than 2,000 kilograms. In order to accumulate farmyard manure, the number of livestock-raising households in various villages has greatly increased. Tuanjie Township in Lanxi County has added more than 400 pigs, an increase of one-third compared to previous years. Peng Village has achieved two pigs per household. Thirteen poor peasant households in Cooperation Village who had never raised pigs before have now also bought piglets. They said with smiles, "In the past, most pig raising was done by landlords, but today it is our turn to poor peasants to raise them." The phenomenon of buying plows, cattle, donkeys and horses is also very common. Since the beginning of winter, Jiashan and Pinghu counties have bought more than 1,800 heads of cattle; seventeen households in Beiyang Village, Weibei County, collectively bought twelve heads of cattle and two donkeys, and bred sixteen calves. In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, the peasants are actively building ponds, dams and river courses. Yangzhong County organized a large number of manpower and waterwheels to launch a movement to transport mud from the ponds; in Tuanjie Township, every morning at daybreak, villages beat gongs to repair dams, and almost all farmers enthusiastically participated in this work. Young women also went barefoot into the ponds to dig mud. Currently, 31 dams have been repaired in the township, saving 3,400 mu of farmland from the threat of flooding, and more than 53,000 dan of pond mud have been excavated, solving the fertilizer problem; The peasants in Beiyang Village also launched a competition in river repair, so the project, which was originally planned to be completed in half a month, was completed in four days, and the project met the standards.

Under the influence of the peasants' enthusiastic production mood, the social atmosphere in the countryside has been completely renewed, and "labor is glorious, and laziness is shameful" has become today's moral standard. In the past, every winter during the slack season, some farmers in various villages gambled and wandered around. Bujiapeng Township, Shouchang County, was a well-known gambling den in the past, and people from other villages came to the village to gamble. After the land reform, the gambling trend has disappeared. A hired worker named Zhou Bingrong used to lose all his wages before he left the landlord's house, but now he has saved more than 20 dan of grain from farming his own land; Huang Jingen, the most famous lazy man in Tuanjie Township, used to get up only when people were cooking lunch, but now he can get up very early to work; more than a dozen vagrants in Xiayu Village have now gone down to the fields. The masses have extremely high faith in the Communist Party and the People's Government. Under the slogan of "believing in Chairman Mao and not believing in clay bodhisattvas," more than 600 old ladies in Chongren Town, Sheng County, automatically stopped chanting Buddha, saving time and money to participate in production; farmers in Xiaoshan who participated in Yiguandao realized that they had been deceived and voluntarily withdrew from the sect; and 2,000 sword wielders in Nanling County withdrew from the "Sword Society" during the land reform. Land reform has also enabled farmers to improve their lives. Poor peasants and hired laborers have the ability to raise pigs and chickens, many new thatched cottages have been added, and most of them have put on new clothes for the New Year. Three hired laborers in Cooperation Village got married and put on new cotton shoes. In Xinzheng Township, Minhou, 48 young farmers got married in three months. Now, as soon as you enter these villages, you can see militiamen on guard, male and female farmers wearing red farmers' association membership cards, happily busy producing in their own fields.

### 华东二万余乡土地改革后  农村一片新气象

　　华东二万余乡土地改革后
    农村一片新气象
    华东区已经完成土地改革的二万二千余个乡，农民劳动生产热情高涨，生活逐步改善，农村中呈现了一片新气象。
    分到土地后的农民深信“只要人手勤，粪土变成金”，人人努力生产。过去麦田和油菜只锄一遍草，现在普遍锄了三遍。他们积极拾粪、挖塘泥、养牲口、提前耕锄，准备春耕大生产，使冬闲变成了冬忙。昆山县重塘乡有二百一十个农民组织了拾粪小组进行拾粪。潍北县北杨村革命军人家属苟立和起早搭晚到大街小巷去拾粪，已经拾了二千多斤。为了积厩肥，各村养牲口户数大大增加，兰溪县团结乡增添了四百多口猪，较往年增加三分之一，彭村已做到每户养二头猪，合作村十三户贫农从未养过猪，现在也都买进了小猪，他们笑逐颜开地说：“过去养猪多半是地主，今天也轮到我们贫农来养了。”购买耕牛、驴马的现象也很普遍。嘉兴、嘉善、平湖三县入冬以来已买进耕牛一千八百多头；潍北县北杨村十七户集体买进了耕牛十二头、驴二头，并且繁殖了十六头小牛。为了争取今年丰收，农民们极积兴修塘坝河道。杨中县组织了大批人力和水车，展开了车塘取泥运动；团结乡每天天一亮，各村都鸣锣修坝，几乎所有农民都热情地参加了这一工作，青年妇女也赤着脚下塘挖泥，现全乡已修好三十一条坝，使三千四百亩田免除水患之虞，并挖出了塘泥五万三千多担，解决了肥料问题；北杨村农民在修河中还掀起了竞赛，因此原计划半月完成的工程，四天中就完成了任务，工程合乎标准。
    在农民们热烈生产情绪的影响下，农村社会风气焕然一新，“劳动光荣、懒汉可耻”已成为今天的道德标准。往年每到冬天农闲时，各村都有部分农民赌博、游荡，寿昌县卜家蓬乡十八村是历来出名的赌窟，外村人都来村中聚赌，土地改革后赌风已经绝迹。有个雇工叫周炳荣，过去拿到工资没出地主家门就已输光，现在自己种田已积余二十多担谷；团结乡顶有名的懒汉黄金根，过去每天人家烧午饭他才起床，现在已能很早起来劳动了；下余村十多个二流子现都已下了田坂。群众对共产党、人民政府的信仰极高，嵊县崇仁镇六百多个老太太在“相信毛主席不相信泥菩萨”的口号下自动地停止了念佛，节省下时间与金钱参加了生产；萧山参加一贯道的农民觉悟到受骗，纷纷自动脱道；南陵县土地改革中有二千个刀徒退出了“刀会”。土地改革同时使农民生活得到了初步改善，贫雇农都有了养猪养鸡的能力，新的茅屋添了不少，过年大都穿上了一袭新衣，合作村还有三个雇工结了婚，穿上新棉鞋。闽候新政乡三个月中有四十八对青年农民结婚。现在一走进这些村，就可以看到民兵在放哨，男女农民挂着红色的农会会员证，在自己的田里欢乐地忙着生产。
