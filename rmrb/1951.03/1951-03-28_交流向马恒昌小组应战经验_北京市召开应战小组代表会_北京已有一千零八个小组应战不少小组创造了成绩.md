　　Exchanging Experiences in Responding to the Ma Hengchang Group's Challenge:
    Beijing Holds Representatives Meeting of Response Groups
    Beijing Has 1,008 Groups Responding to the Challenge; Many Groups Have Achieved Results
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of representatives from all factories responding to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge on the 25th and 26th of this month. The meeting was attended by 161 representatives from 1,008 response groups in public and private industrial and mining enterprises, with 78 cadres from grassroots trade union organizations attending as observers.
    The main purpose of this meeting was to summarize and exchange experiences in group work after responding to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge; to consolidate the achievements already made, and to carry out patriotic production emulation more broadly and deeply.
    Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech: At present, there are 1,008 groups in Beijing that have responded to the Ma Hengchang Group's challenge, and more than 65 percent of the workers in the larger industrial and mining enterprises have been involved in this movement, creating significant achievements in production.
    On the first day afternoon and the second day morning, 15 group representatives from various factories made typical speeches. From these speeches, it can be seen that the key to doing a good job in group work lies mainly in the leadership of the group leader. The group leader should first play an exemplary role in the work and influence and drive the masses with actions. For example, in the Zhang Fengquan group of the machining department of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the administration originally set 100 copper balls for sprayers per work shift in February. Many workers felt it was too high. The deputy group leader, Huang Runping, first made them for everyone to see, and as a result, 150 were produced per work shift, which enhanced the confidence of other workers in completing the task. The group leader must unite well with activists in the work, play a core leading role, and grasp the situation of group members in all aspects of ideology, work, and life, and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, in the Liu Qing group of odd-job workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, many workers had the idea that odd-job workers were "lowly" and could not compete. The group leader repeatedly explained to everyone, reversing this incorrect idea and launching a work competition. Since responding to the challenge, they have saved the public more than 50,000 kilograms of coal.
    After group discussions on the afternoon of the 26th, Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, made a concluding speech to the conference. He requested that the representatives attending the meeting earnestly convey the experiences exchanged at the meeting to all workers in factories and mining enterprises.
    Dong Xin, Minister of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave instructions on group work at the meeting. He focused on introducing the experiences in group work in the Northeast and called on all representatives attending the meeting to guard against arrogance and rashness, humbly learn from others' strengths, correct their own shortcomings, promote their own experiences, and drive more people to participate in the patriotic production emulation.
    The conference passed a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen and Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han supporting the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, a letter to all workers of the Ma Hengchang Group, and a declaration responding to the call of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association to popularize and deepen the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement throughout the country.

　　交流向马恒昌小组应战经验
    北京市召开应战小组代表会
    北京已有一千零八个小组应战不少小组创造了成绩
    【本报讯】北京市总工会在本月二十五、二十六两天召开了全市各厂向马恒昌小组应战的小组代表会议。参加这个会议的有公私营工矿、企业一千零八个应战小组的代表一百六十一人，列席会议的有各工会基层组织干部七十八人。
    这次会议的主要目的，是总结和交流向马恒昌小组应战后的小组工作经验；巩固已经得到的成绩，更广泛更深入地开展爱国主义生产竞赛。
    市总工会刘莱夫副主席在讲话中指出：现在北京市全市向马恒昌小组应战的小组已有一千零八个，在比较大的工矿企业中，已有百分之六十五以上的职工卷入了这个运动。并在生产上创造了显著的成绩。
    会议的第一天下午和第二天上午有各厂十五个小组代表的典型发言。从这些发言中可以看出，搞好小组工作的关键，主要在于小组长的领导，小组长在工作中首先应该起模范作用，用行动来影响和带动群众。如华北农业机械总厂车工部张凤泉小组，二月份做喷雾器铜球，行政原订每工一百个，许多工人都嫌高，副组长黄润平便先做给大家看，结果每工出了一百五十个，增强了其他工人完成任务的信心。小组长在工作中要和积极分子团结得很好，发挥核心领导作用，掌握组员思想、工作和生活各方面的情况，及时解决问题。如石景山钢铁厂勤杂工刘庆小组，许多工人都存在勤杂工“下贱”，不能竞赛的思想，小组长就反复向大家解释，扭转了这个不正确的思想，展开了工作竞赛，他们应战以来，已经给公家节省了五万多斤煤。
    二十六日下午小组讨论后，市总工会刘莱夫副主席对大会作总结发言，他要求到会代表把会议上所交换的经验，认真地传达到各厂矿企业的全体职工中去。
    全国总工会生产部董昕部长在会上对小组工作做了指示。他着重介绍了东北小组工作中的经验，并号召到会全体代表要戒骄戒躁，虚心学习别人的长处，改正自己的缺点，推广自己的经验，带动更多的群众参加爱国主义生产竞赛。
    大会通过了给彭真市长和张友渔、吴晗副市长拥护政府镇压反革命的信，给马恒昌小组全体工人的信和响应中国人民抗美援朝总会在全国普及深入开展抗美援朝运动的号召的宣言。
