　　Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River
     ——Chronicle of the Battle on the South Bank of the Han River, Part Two
    Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Wei Wei
    In the motherland, it is already spring; but here, everything still retains the appearance of winter. The wide, winding Han River is still covered with silver ice and snow, and the mountains on both sides of the river are still silver. The low, drifting clouds are also white and misty, only the pine forests on the mountainside and in the valleys are dotted with patches of black. – This is the natural scenery of the Han River front.
    The enemy's closest point to Seoul is no more than fifteen kilometers, even closer to the Han River. The commanders of the U.S. invading army could have seen Seoul through their binoculars long ago, and if they drove a jeep, it would take less than twenty minutes. But instead of twenty minutes, they used more than nine divisions, twenty days, and the blood of more than eleven thousand thugs, turning the ice and snow on these silver mountains red. Yet Seoul, as seen through their binoculars, is not much closer than it was twenty days ago.
    Why? Why is it that this notorious imperialism, with more than two hundred thousand troops, cannot advance more than ten kilometers in more than twenty days?
    Is it because their artillery is not good enough? No. Their artillery is indeed ferocious. They can turn a hilltop from white snow to black snow, old soil to new soil, a pine forest into sorghum stubble, with pine branches and trunks scattered all over the ground. If they could pour all the steel in the world onto one position in an hour, they would not hesitate.
    But they still cannot advance.
    Is it because they don't have enough planes? Are they not good enough? Or is it that their coordination with the ground is not good? Also, no. Their planes dominate the sky, and their coordination with the ground is not bad. They can arbitrarily drop heavy bombs and incendiary bombs on our front-line positions and villages near the front line, causing flames to rise from every position. They can burn lush green mountain peaks into blackness.
    Then, is it because they are not attacking actively enough? Even more so, no. Generally speaking, after their first charge is repulsed, the second charge is not organized too slowly. Initially, they attacked two or three times a day, later increasing to five or six times, seven or eight times, or even more than ten times. Regardless of the American corpses piled up in front of our positions, already blocking their own path of attack, they still used a sea of fire, a sea of flesh, to surge towards our beachhead positions. Finally, their attacks were no longer counted by the number of times. On some of our positions where ammunition was scarce, they forced the puppet Rhee troops to engage with us, and after being beaten back, they stayed fifty meters away from us, building fortifications and fighting us. Their planes and artillery could bombard as much as possible, day and night, rain or shine. At night, they pulled up a net of flares and searchlights in the sky. Finally, they released poison gas. You see, except for the atomic bomb, they have taken out everything they have. Everything they could do, they have done without omission. Can their attacks be described as anything but insane?
    But, have they advanced? No.
    So, what is the reason after all? The reason is simple: it is because in front of the enemy, on the narrow beachhead on the south bank of the Han River, there lurks the bravest army in the world, there lurks heroic people with superior tactical skills!
    Of course, the battle is fierce and arduous. – It's not as easy as some people think, picking a bunch of flowers and plants in a garden or field. Every inch of land here is repeatedly fought over. The soldiers here have parched lips, deafened ears, and bloodshot eyes. However, they swallow a mouthful of dry fried flour with their parched lips, wash it down with a mouthful of snow. When they can't hear, they stare unblinkingly forward with their bloodshot eyes in the billowing smoke. When necessary, they have to use gunstocks, bayonets, and stones damaged by artillery fire to fight the enemy down. The commanders of the regiments and divisions here sometimes have to roll up maps in burning houses and move to another room. The telephone operators here have to connect telephone lines that have been cut off by artillery fire dozens of times a day. Every commander’s time here is not passing minute by minute, but second by second!
    One night, I arrived at a small room that was the command post of a certain regiment. A Korean small round kang table was covered with a map, and a candle was lit. Planes were still buzzing incessantly outside. The deputy division commander was looking at the map with the regimental commander and political commissar. After they had studied it carefully, the deputy division commander – a slightly aged middle-aged soldier – opened his silver cigarette case and gave each of us a cigarette. We were lighting it on the candle when, suddenly, with two loud "thumps," the candle jumped to the ground and went out. The tarpaulin covering the window was also shaken down. The light from the flare shone on the window like a full moon.
    But no one moved. The regimental commander picked up the candle from the kang and lit it again. The political commissar brushed the dirt that had fallen on the map. The guard remounted the tarpaulin on the window. We lit our cigarettes again.
    The regimental commander looked at the deputy division commander, smiling as if seeking someone's agreement, and said, "Deputy division commander! Do you think our battle is a bit like 'Days and Nights'?"
    The deputy division commander pondered for a moment and said in a low voice: "Yes, we are experiencing a war that we have never experienced before. We, no –" He corrected himself, pointing to the map with a rough red line drawn on it, "Everyone here is experiencing a 'Days and Nights' kind of test." He paused, then suddenly, he flicked off the ash and smiled, "However, we have quite a few Shabrovs!"
    On the most tense day of the battle, at the division headquarters, I heard the division political commissar – who hadn't shaved for a long time and whose eyes were bloodshot – always mention these few sentences every time he called his subordinates: "Comrades! You must be tired, right?" He didn't seem to want his subordinates to answer, and immediately said: "I know you are tired." Then, his voice became serious and heavy: "We should clearly tell the comrades the significance of holding on. Our holding on is to contain the enemy so that the troops on the east can annihilate the enemy. We will not conduct meaningless holding and attrition. You know, we must hold on until that day." After a pause, he said again: "We must also tell the comrades, what kind of ability is it to defeat the enemy with planes and artillery? Looking at the history of the revolution, the counter-revolutionaries' weapons have always been much better than ours, but it is always they who fail, not us. Not to mention exceeding them in this regard, if it is once balanced, or close to balance, they will cease to exist! Today, our weapons are not as good as the enemy's, and it is precisely under these conditions that we must defeat them. Our ability lies here!" He moved the headset away, as if he was about to put it down, but quickly took it back and added, "Our motherland will know how we defeated the enemy!"
    On the front lines, the soldiers were fighting with the same heroic will as the political commissar.
    Here, I want to record a story of two people holding a position. One of them is named Xin Jiusi, whom I personally interviewed. I quickly found that he was a smart young man who understood the whole sentence when someone said half a sentence. He is only twenty years old this year and comes from Heilongjiang. He is a Communist Party member of just two years. In the hard battles since going abroad, like many soldiers, the knees and crotch of his pants were torn, but he mended them very neatly. Standing there, he was so handsome and lovable. One day in the evening, when he returned to the forward position after counterattacking the enemy, he saw that many of his comrades in his platoon were sitting in their fortifications, still maintaining the posture of throwing grenades and shooting, and had sacrificed their lives. Only one soldier, Wang Zhicheng, was left; but he was still squatting in the fortification, looking down, his expression still very calm, only firing a shot every now and then. The enemy did not know how many people were there and dared not come up. Xin Jiusi crawled to Wang Zhicheng's side and quietly asked, "Do you have any ammunition left?" Wang Zhicheng replied quietly and humorously: "Only his two brothers are left, what about you?" Xin Jiusi made a circle with his thumb and index finger. At this time, it was already dark. The enemy's whistles were ringing all over the mountains, and the enemy's artillery had already extended its fire. Foreign languages were also being spoken loudly on the rear company positions. – Obviously, the company's position had retreated. Wang Zhicheng said: "Deputy squad leader, the main force of the company has withdrawn, why didn't they send a message?" Xin Jiusi said: "Yes, why didn't they send a message, but without orders, we can't withdraw. Didn't we tell the squad leader that we must hold the position with just one person? Can two people lose the position?" Wang Zhicheng nodded and said, "Of course. I made up my mind long ago. Good comrades sacrificed themselves for the motherland, what does it matter if we die!" Xin Jiusi immediately corrected him and said: "How can we die? If the sky falls, we all die together. If we cross the river, there are rafts. If the enemy comes up, we'll smash them with stones for a while, roll down the slope, and those cowards won't find us. That's how I rolled down just now." Speaking of this, Wang Zhicheng seemed to have suddenly remembered something and said: "Deputy squad leader, let's quickly squat in two fortifications, if a shell hits one, there will still be one guarding the position!" Saying that, the two squatted in two fortifications. Xin Jiusi leaned over and encouraged him, saying: "Wang Zhicheng! Hold on well, you'll be credited when we go back!" Wang Zhicheng smiled under the starlight and nodded. They were so calm, not panicked at all, looking ahead for a while, and listening behind them for a while. At this time, the enemy's artillery was already firing further and further towards the rear of the position. The enemy was making a lot of noise all around. This place was already like an isolated island in the sea. But the enemy still dared not come up to this position that had given him the most severe blow. Several hours passed, the night was deep and the wind was cold, their bodies and guns were covered with frost, and they were stamping their feet in the trenches from the cold. Wang Zhicheng called out to Xin Jiusi again: "Deputy squad leader! It's so deserted here, let's eat fried flour, don't let us get hungry." "Okay," Xin Jiusi agreed, and the two untied the fried flour bags. The wind was howling, and after swallowing a mouthful of fried flour, they had to quickly cover their mouths. It was not until the messenger stepped through knee-deep snow to call them that they bypassed the enemy and walked back, guided by the Big Dipper.
    After this soldier finished telling his story, he looked at me with his young, sparkling eyes and added: "Since going abroad, even the non-Party masses have been so determined, proposing to receive merit and join the Party. What is there for me, a Party member, to be afraid of? If the war is fought in the Northeast, fought in our motherland," Saying this, his eyes dimmed as if a cloud had risen, and he pointed to a Korean old woman in front of him who was carrying a child and still trying to find something in the burnt house, saying, "Aren't our parents just like her? ... You don't know, I'm the person who hates crying the most. I think it's a shame for men to cry. In the old society, when my mother sold me to others, my mother cried like a tearful person, but I didn't shed a single tear. But this time when I came to Korea, I saw that the Korean people were suffering so much from the American devils, and I cried. Now, it's already spring, but the people's land has not been planted yet, what will they eat in the future? ... If the American devils fight to our motherland, like this bombing, like this burning, our country is not like Korea, there are so many people, and the villages are so dense!"
    The soldiers, they are fighting like this, holding on with such a great and invincible spirit.
    Therefore, you can understand: the enemy, in front of our soldiers, although possessing firepower superiority and air force assistance, is bound to fail to achieve victory. Moreover, it should be especially pointed out that under such artillery fire from the enemy, the enemy's casualties far exceed ours.
    Here I want to give a not-so-outstanding company as an example. This company is precisely because it is not outstanding, that it is often ridiculed by some young soldiers of other companies, and even given nicknames. This time, in the resistance, people thought that this "company" did not fight well. According to the head of the regiment, who personally inspected the company's position, there were fifty-one American devils' corpses in front of a certain platoon's position in the company. Although only six people were left in this platoon in the end, two of whom were wounded, it was these six people who made sixteen American soldiers who rushed to the front become prisoners.
    In the days and nights on the south bank of the Han River, our heroic troops not only used their strong defense to make the enemy pile up corpses like mountains and blood flow like rivers in front of our positions; more importantly, they constantly used strong counterattacks to retake positions, causing even more serious casualties to the enemy. I constantly heard the commanders tell their troops: "Don't be honest in front of the enemy, you shouldn't be beaten, you should counterattack, resolutely counterattack!"
    Once, a battalion of the enemy's attacking troops had advanced to within less than a thousand meters of the headquarters of a certain division of ours. That night, a certain unit of ours launched a powerful counterattack. They cut off the American battalion's return route and almost annihilated the entire American battalion, capturing more than eighty prisoners alive, with only a few enemies fleeing. According to the political commissar of this unit, "When our troops heard that they were going to counterattack the enemy, you don't know where that energy came from. It's like a young horse being released for the first time in the spring, you can't even hold the reins. That night, from very far away, I heard the artillery platoon leader shouting "Prepare – fire!" "Prepare – fire!" The battalion commander scolded them: "Why are you shouting so loudly, what's the use?" They were still: "Prepare – fire!" "Prepare – fire!" They were so excited that they couldn't even hear what others were saying. There was a vanguard squad that was out of contact. No one knew where they had gone. The result was that they walked too fast and drilled straight into the enemy's heart, eliminating an enemy squad and bringing back five prisoners. Everyone then found them. Do you think they were reckless or not? The most interesting thing is that our platoon leader Comrade Zhang Lichun, he is a combat hero who has been credited with five major merits. This time, when he pounced on the enemy's position, he saw that four American soldiers had put their lower bodies in sleeping bags. He got anxious, couldn't wait for the comrades behind him, first killed one, then pounced on him, stepped on one with his foot, grabbed the hair of the other two guys with both hands, and pressed them face down in the mud, while saying fiercely: "Chinese people used to always be under your feet. Today, you should lower your heads!" The two guys didn't understand what he was saying and just rolled their eyes... Don't you think our comrade is like a little tiger?"
    In the fierce and arduous days and nights, both generals and soldiers were anxiously looking forward to the arrival of this day, just like looking forward to meeting their dearest relatives. That day was February 12th, the day our troops in the eastern section of the Han River launched an attack. Sure enough, on this day, second by second, it approached and arrived. Immediately, in less than three days, news came of the annihilation of two enemy divisions in Hengcheng. These two victories combined are what our people saw - the Han River front annihilated more than 23,000 enemy soldiers - a number that condenses countless heroic stories of many days and nights. After that, the soldiers on the front line patted off the dust of those days and nights and crossed the silver, wide Han River, which was about to thaw, and returned to the north bank of the Han River in an orderly manner to rest. But the timid enemy, two days after our retreat, still dared not step on the silver mountains that shone with heroic glory.

　　汉江南岸的日日夜夜
     ——汉江南岸战斗纪实之二
    本报特约记者  魏巍
    在祖国已经是春天了；可在这儿一切还留着冬季的容貌。宽阔的弯曲的汉江，还铺着银色的冰雪，江两岸，还是银色的山岭，低沉的流荡的云气，也是白濛濛的，只有松林在山腰里、峡谷里抹着一片片乌黑。——这就是汉江前线的自然风色。
    敌人离汉城最近处不过十五公里，离汉江还要近些。美国侵略军的指挥官们早可以从望远镜里看见汉城了，如果开动吉普车，可以用不到二十分钟。可是他们不是用了二十分钟，他们是用了九个多师的兵力，用了二十天的时间，用了一万一千多暴徒的血，把这些银色山岭上的冰雪涂成了红的，可是他们从望远镜里所看到的汉城，并不比二十天以前近多少。
    为什么呢？为什么这个大名鼎鼎的帝国主义，二十多万军队二十多天连十多公里都走不了呢？
    是他们的炮火不行吗？不是。他们的炮火确实凶恶得很。他们能够把一个山头打得白雪变黑雪，旧土变新土，松树林变成高粱楂子，松树的枝干倒满一地。假若他们能够把全世界上的钢铁，在一小时倾泄到一个阵地上的话，也是不会吝惜的。
    可是，他们还是不能前进。
    是因为他们的飞机不多吗？不行吗？或者是它们和地面的配合不好吗？也不是。他们的飞机独霸天空，和地面的配合也并不坏。他们可以任意把我们的前沿阵地和前线附近的村庄，投上重磅炸弹和燃烧弹，使每一块阵地都升起火苗，可以把长着茂草的山峰，烧成乌黑。
    那么，是因为他们攻得不积极吗？更不是。一般说，当他们的第一次冲锋被击溃之后，第二次冲锋组织得并不算太迟慢。开始他们每天攻两三次，以后增加到五六次，七八次，甚至十几次。不管我们阵地前，积起的美国人的死尸，已经阻塞了他们自己进攻的道路，但他们还是用火的海，肉的海，向我们的滩头阵地冲激。最后，他们的攻击，已经不分次数，在我弹药缺乏的某些阵地上，他们逼着李伪军和我胶着起来，被我打退后，就停留在距我五十米外修建工事，跟我们扭击。他们的飞机、炮火，可以不分日夜，不分阴晴，尽量地轰射。夜间，他们在天空拉起照明弹、探照灯的网。最后，他们又施放了毒气。你们看，除了原子弹，他们所有的都拿出来了，他们所能够做的，都毫无遗漏地做了。他们的攻击可以说是不疯狂的吗？
    可是，他们前进了没有呢？没有。
    那么，到底是因为什么呢？原因很简单：这就是在敌人的面前，在汉江南岸的狭小的滩头阵地上，隐伏着世界上第一流勇敢的军队，隐伏着具有优越战术素养的英雄的人！
    当然，战斗是激烈而艰苦的。——这并不像某些人所想的，我们的胜利像在花园里、野原上随手撷取一束花草那么容易。这儿的每一寸土地，都在反复地争夺。这儿的战士，嘴唇焦干了，耳朵震聋了，眼睛熬红了，然而，他们用干焦的嘴唇吞一口干炒面，咽一口雪，耳朵听不见，就用结满红丝的眼睛，在腾腾的烟雾里，不瞬地向前凝视。必要时，他们必须用炮火损坏的枪把、刺刀、石头，把敌人拚下去，这儿团师的指挥员们，有时不得不在烧着大火的房子里，卷起地图转到另一间房子里去。这儿的电话员，每天几十次地去接被炮火击断的电话线。这儿每一个指挥员的时间，不是一分钟一分钟地过，而是一秒钟，一秒钟地度过！
    某日夜晚，我到达某团指挥所的一间小房。一张朝鲜的小圆炕桌上铺着地图，点着一支洋蜡烛，飞机还在外面不绝地嗡嗡着。副师长正和团长、政治委员在看地图。他们研究妥当以后，副师长——一个略显苍老的中年军人，打开他那银色的烟盒，给了我们每人一支香烟。我们正在洋蜡上对火，突然随着“嗵嗵”两声巨响，洋蜡忽地跳到地上熄灭了。蒙着窗子的雨布也震落下来。照明弹的亮光像一轮满月一样照在窗上。
    但谁也没有动。团长把洋蜡从炕上拾起，又点着了。政治委员拂去地图上震落的泥土。警卫员把雨布又蒙在窗上。我们又点起了香烟。
    团长象征求别人同意似地笑着，瞅着副师长，说：“副师长！你看我们的战斗有点像‘日日夜夜’吧？”
    副师长沉吟了一下，声音并不高地说：“是的，我们正经历着没有经历过的一个战争。我们，不——”他纠正自己，指了指桌上画着一条粗犷红线的地图“这儿的每一个人都在经历着‘日日夜夜’式的考验。”他停了一下，忽然，又弹掉烟灰，微笑着：“不过，我们的沙勃洛夫是不少的！”
    在战斗最紧张的一天，在师指挥所，我听到师政治委员——他长久没有刮胡子，眼睛熬得红红的，在他每次打电话给他下级的时候，总要提到这几句：“同志们！你们辛苦了吧？”他似乎并不要下级回答，紧接着说：“我知道你们是辛苦的。”然后，他的声音又严肃又沉重：“应该清楚地告诉同志们坚守的意义，我们的坚守，是为了箝制敌人，使东面的部队歼灭敌人；没有意义的坚守和消耗，我们是不会进行的。你们知道的，我们一定要守到那一天。”停了一停，又说：“还要告诉同志们，有飞机大炮才能打胜敌人算什么本事呢？从革命的历史来看。反革命的武器总是比我们好得多，然而失败的总是他们，而不是我们。不要说在这方面超过他们，假若一旦平衡，或者接近平衡，他们就会不存在了！今天，我们的武器不如敌人，就正是在这样条件下，我们还要战胜他。我们的本事就在这里！”他把耳机移开，似乎要放下的样子，但又迅速拿回来，补充了一句：“我们的祖国会知道我们是怎样战胜敌人的！”
    在阵地上，战士们就是以政治委员的同一英雄意志，进行着战斗。
    这里，我要记下一段两个人坚守阵地的故事。其中一个名叫辛九思，我亲自访问了他。我很快发现他是一个别人说半句话，他就懂得全句意思的聪明青年，今年才二十岁，黑龙江人。是一个刚刚两年的共产党员。现在是副班长。在出国以后的苦战中，他像许多的战士一样，裤子的膝盖、裤裆都飞了花，但他补得很干净。站在那儿，是那样英俊而可爱。某天傍晚，当他到前哨阵地反击敌人回来以后，见自己排的阵地上，许多战友都坐在自己的工事里，还保持着投弹射击的姿势而牺牲了。只剩下了战士王志成一个人；可是他还在工事里蹲着，眼往下瞅着，神色仍然很宁静，半天才打一枪。敌人不知道这儿有多少人，也不敢上来。辛九思爬到王志成的身边悄悄地问：“你还有弹药吗？”王志成悄悄地、幽默地答：“只有他兄弟两个啦，你呢？”辛九思用大姆指和食指比了一个圆圈。这时，天已经黑了。敌人的哨音满山乱响，敌人的炮已经进行延伸射击，后面的连阵地上，也哇啦哇啦地说着外国话。——显然，连的阵地已经后撤了。王志成说：“副班长，连的主力已经撤了，怎么没有送信来呢？”辛九思说：“是呀，怎么没送信呢，可是没命令，我们就不能撤。我们不是给班长表示过，只要有一个人就要守住阵地。有两个人还能丢掉阵地吗？”王志成点点头说：“那当然。我的决心早下了。人家很好的同志都为祖国牺牲了，我们死了，有什么关系！”辛九思马上纠正他说：“那能死呢？天塌大家死，过河有槎子，敌人上来咱们砸他一阵石头，往坡下一滚，那些胆小鬼不会找着咱们的。我刚才就是这样滚下来的。”说到这里，王志成像忽然想起了一件事情，说：“副班长，咱们两还是快蹲到两个工事里吧，炮弹打住一个，还有一个守阵地的！”说着，两个人就蹲在两个工事里了。辛九思又探过头去鼓励地说：“王志成！好好坚守，回去给你立功呵！”王志成在星光下笑了一笑，点了点头。他们是这么沉着，一点也不慌乱，一会看看前头，一会听听后面。这时，敌人的炮，已经向阵地的后方，打得更远更远了。四外的阵地上，敌人乱吵吵的。这里已经像一座海水中的孤岛。但敌人仍旧不敢上到这个给他打击最严重的阵地。几个钟头过去了，夜深风冷，他们的身上，枪上，结满了霜花，冻得在战壕里跺着脚。王志成又招呼辛九思：“副班长！咱们这儿怪冷清的，咱们吃炒面吧，别叫饿着。”“好吧，”辛九思答应着，两个人就把炒面袋子解开，风呜呜吹着，吞一口炒面，就要把口儿连忙捂住。直等通讯员踏过膝盖深的白雪来叫他们的时候，他们才按着北斗星的指示绕过敌人走回来。
    当这个战士叙述完他的故事之后，他用他年轻人特有的明闪闪的眼睛看着我，又补充说：“出国以来，人家非党群众还那样坚决，都提出立功入党呢，我是个党员，又有什么可怕的呢？假若战争打到东北，打到咱们的祖国，”说到这里，他的眼睛像生起一片阴云似的暗了一下，随手一指面前一个背着小孩还希图在烧焦房子里找出什么东西的朝鲜老妇人说：“我们的父母还不跟她一样的吗？……你不知道，我是个最不爱流泪的人。我认为男子流泪，是羞耻的。在旧社会的时候，我母亲把我卖给别人，我母亲哭得像泪人一样，但我没有掉一滴眼泪。可是这一次到朝鲜，我看见朝鲜老百姓被美国鬼子害得那么苦，我哭了。现在，已经春天了，老百姓的地还没有种上，他们将来吃什么呢？……假若美国鬼子打到我们的祖国，像这样的炸，像这样的烧，咱们国又不比朝鲜，人是那样的多，村庄又是那样的稠密呵！……”
    战士们，他们就是这样的战斗着，就是怀着这样伟大的不可战胜的心灵坚守着。
    因此，你可以明白：敌人在我们这样的战士面前，虽然拥有火力优势与空军的助战，是必然不能取得胜利的。而且，特别应该指出：在敌人这样的炮火下，敌人的死伤，是远远地超过了我们。
    这里我要举一个并不出色的连队来做例子。这个连队正因为不出色，以致常遭其他连某些年轻战士的嘲笑，甚至给他们加上一些诨号。这次抗击，人们又以为这个“连”打得不好，据团首长亲自到该连的阵地上检查，该连某个排的阵地前就有五十一具美国鬼子的尸体。这个排虽然最后只剩了六个人，其中还有两个负伤的，但正是这六个人还使冲到面前的十六个美国兵，做了俘虏。
    在汉江南岸的日日夜夜里，我们英雄的部队，他们并不止是用坚强的防守，使敌人在我们的阵地前尸堆成山，血流成河；重要的，他们还不断用强烈的反击，夺回阵地，造成敌人更严重的伤亡。我不断听指挥员告诉他们的队部：“不能在敌人面前表现老实，你们不应该挨打，应该反击，坚决地反击！”
    某次，敌人进攻部队的一个营，已经进到我某师指挥所的附近不足一千米。当天晚上，我们某部就进行了一个强大的反击。他们插断了这个美国营的归路，几乎将这个美国营全部歼灭，活捉了八十多个俘虏，仅有少数敌人逃窜。据这个部队的政治委员告诉我：“当我们的部队一听说去反击敌人的时候，你不知道从那里来的那股劲儿。就好像春天头一回放青的马子一样，连缰绳你都拉不住了。那天晚上，很远、很远我就听到炮兵排长喊“预备——放！”“预备——放！”营长骂他们：“你们声音这么高干什么用呢？”他们还是：“预备——放！”“预备——放！”他们真是兴奋得连别人的话都听不见了。有一个失连络的尖兵班，别人都不知道他们那里去了，结果是因为他们走的太快，一直钻到敌人的心脏里消灭了敌人一个班，还带回来五个俘虏，大家才找着了他们，你看莽撞不莽撞？最有趣的，是我们的一个排长张利春同志，他是立过五个大功的战斗英雄。这次，当他扑到敌人阵地上的时候，他看到有四个美国兵都把下半截身子装在睡袋里，他急了眼，来不及等后面的同志，先打死了一个，接着就扑上去，用脚踏住一个，两只手抓住另外两个家伙的头发，捺了个嘴啃泥，一边狠狠地说：“中国人过去总是在你们的脚底下，今天，你们该低低头了！”两个家伙又不懂他的话，只是翻着白眼……你看看咱们的那个同志不像个小老虎呢。”
    在激烈而艰苦的日日夜夜，无论将军和战士都像盼和最亲爱的人会面一样的，焦盼着这一天的到来，即二月十二日，这一天是我汉江东段部队出击的日子。果然，这一天，一秒钟，一秒钟，接近了，来到了。马上，不出三天，就传来横城歼敌两个师的消息。这两个胜利汇在一起，就是我们祖国人民所看到的——汉江前线歼敌两万三千余人——那个凝结着许多日日夜夜无数英雄故事的数目字，这以后，前线的战士们，拍拍那日日夜夜的尘土，就跨过将要解冻的银色的宽阔的汉江，井然有序地回到汉江北岸休息了。可是胆怯的敌人，在我们撤退的后两天，还不敢踏上那闪射着英雄光辉的银色的山岭。
