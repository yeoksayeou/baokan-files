　　Emphasizing Secondary Education
    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government is currently holding a national conference on secondary education, which is of great significance.

    Secondary education is the key to cultivating a large number of intermediate-level construction talents and reserves for high-level construction talents for the country. Primary education and worker-peasant education urgently need a large number of excellent teachers, further emphasizing the task of secondary education. Various units and organizations also urgently need middle school students who have received general secondary education and possess a certain level of cultural knowledge to participate in work after short-term training. According to the Ministry of Education's estimates, this year's higher primary school graduates will total about one million, and there are not enough secondary schools to accommodate them. Secondary education is an important link in the country's educational construction, connecting the past and the future, and it must serve the country's national defense, economic, and cultural construction. If we ignore this point, our education will be divorced from the actual needs of national construction. In order for secondary education to fulfill this important task well, the convening of the national conference on secondary education is very necessary.

    According to statistics from the second half of 1950, there were more than 5,000 secondary schools in the country, with a student population of more than 1.5 million. Among them, general middle schools account for the largest proportion, with the number of general middle schools accounting for 78.4% of the total number of secondary schools in the country, and general middle school students accounting for 82% of the total number of secondary school students in the country. The proportion of secondary technical schools and normal schools is very small. This is extremely unsuited to the current needs of national construction. Therefore, based on the current situation and conditions, we should focus on developing secondary technical education and normal education, and carry out adjustment and consolidation work on general middle schools in order to lay a good foundation and prepare for future development. At the same time, we must also pay attention to implementing the policy of considering both public and private interests, actively supporting and strengthening the leadership of private secondary schools so that they can better serve national construction, and reward private schools, so that people's education can have more development. In the future, in the national education work, the idea of attaching importance to secondary education should be established.

    Since the scope of secondary education is very broad, including secondary schools of various natures, the national conference on secondary education convened by the Central Ministry of Education this time decided to focus on solving the issue of the direction and tasks of secondary education, and concentrate efforts on solving several major problems of ordinary middle schools, which account for the largest proportion of secondary education, such as their nature, tasks, teaching plans, curriculum, textbooks, leadership relations, public-private relations, and the health problems of students at all levels of schools. As for other issues, the Ministry of Education will prepare to convene professional conferences to solve them separately. This decision is very good, and we believe that after this meeting, national secondary schools will have good improvements and development in quality and quantity.

　　重视中等教育
    中央人民政府教育部现在正召开全国中等教育会议，这是有重大意义的。
    中等教育是大量培养国家中级建设人才和高级建设人才后备军的。初等教育和工农教育迫切需要大量的优良的教师，更加重了中等教育的任务。各部队、各机关也迫切需要受过普通中等教育，具有相当文化水平的中学生，经过短期训练之后，参加工作。据教育部的估计，今年的高小毕业生约计一百万人，还没有足够的中等学校能够收纳他们。中等教育实是国家教育建设中承上接下的重要环节，它必须为国家的国防、经济、文化建设服务。如果我们忽视这一点，我们的教育就会和国家建设的实际需要脱节。而为了使中等教育能很好地完成这一重大任务，全国中等教育会议的召开是十分必要的。
    据一九五○年下半年的统计，全国中等学校共有五千多所，学生人数有一百五十多万人。其中以普通中学占最大多数，普通中学校数占全国中等学校总数百分之七十八点四，普通中学生占全国中等学校学生总数百分之八十二。中等技术学校和师范学校所占的比例很小。这对目前国家建设的需要是极不能适应的。因此根据目前情况与条件，我们应着重地发展中等技术教育和师范教育，并对普通中学作调整和巩固的工作，以便打好基础，准备今后的发展。同时还必须注意贯彻公私兼顾的政策，对私立中等学校积极扶持、加强领导。使它们能更好地为国家建设服务，并奖励私人办学，使人民教育事业，能有更多的发展。今后在全国教育工作中，应该确立重视中等教育的思想。
    由于中等教育的范围很广，包括各种不同性质的中等学校，这次中央教育部召开的全国中等教育会议，决定着重解决中等教育的方针、任务问题，并集中力量解决占中等教育中比例最大的普通中学的几个主要问题，如它们的性质、任务、教学计划、课程、教材和领导关系、公私关系等问题，和各级学校学生的健康问题。至于其它问题，教育部将准备另行召开专业会议来解决。这个决定是很好的，我们相信在这次会议后，全国中等学校在质和量上，将会有很好的提高和发展。
