    My Eyes Turn Red When I Hear About the Japanese Beasts
    A People's Liberation Army Soldier's Accusation
    To the Editor:
    After reading the article "The Thousand-Person Tomb" in the People's Daily on February 25th, which recorded the massacre committed by Japanese bandits in Fuping County, Hebei Province, I couldn't help but recall the scene of my family being brutally murdered by the Japanese bandits.

    In June 1943, the Japanese bandits carried out a frenzied "mopping-up" operation on the vast plains of southern Hebei Province. On June 13th, more than five hundred Japanese devils and puppet soldiers surrounded our village. The beasts gathered all the men, women, old and young in the village on the square outside the village, demanding that we identify the Eighth Route Army and anti-Japanese personnel. In fact, the Japanese devils had done this kind of thing countless times everywhere. They often brutally killed women and children in public, or collectively shot the people to death. People would never reveal the Eighth Route Army or anti-Japanese personnel even to death. This time, because the Japanese had traitors with them who informed on us, more than a dozen anti-Japanese personnel were discovered by the enemy. My second brother was a scout for the Eighth Route Army, and the enemy shot him on the spot as a warning to others. My seventeen-year-old sister was raped by the Japanese beasts, and then the beasts used a hand grenade to blow her to death. I was only thirteen years old at the time, and the Japanese beasts said I was a little Eighth Route Army soldier and turned me upside down, throwing me into a puddle. My eldest brother and third brother were also arrested by the Japanese bandits. Our house was also burned down. My mother, in order to rescue my brothers, had her teeth knocked out by the beasts. My eldest brother was押 (Not sure of the best way to translate) to the mine by the Japanese bandits to work as a coolie; my third brother, who was always brave and strong, finally broke through the prison window at night and escaped, and then joined the Eighth Route Army. When I grew up a little, in order to avenge my second brother and sister, I also joined our Eighth Route Army, and I have been here ever since.

    In the past, my eyes turned red whenever I heard about the Japanese beasts; but I didn't have a clear understanding of American imperialism, and I felt that Japanese bandits and American imperialism were always two different things. But the facts have educated me time and time again that in history, for nearly a hundred years, American imperialism and Japanese bandits have always colluded with each other and been hostile to our country; American imperialism uses Japan as a base, using Japan's material resources and manpower to invade Korea; and now it is further preparing to make a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan. We must never let the Japanese bandits harm us again. I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and I will intensify my study of modern military technology to strengthen national defense.

### 提到日本野兽我就红了眼  人民解放军战士的控诉

    提到日本野兽我就红了眼
    人民解放军战士的控诉编辑同志：
    我在二月二十五日的人民日报上，看到记载日寇在河北省阜平县制造惨案的“千人墓”一稿后，使我不由地回想起家人惨遭日寇杀害的情形。
    一九四三年六月，日寇在河北省南部大平原上，进行疯狂的大“清剿”。六月十三日那天，五百多日本鬼子和伪军把我们的村庄包围了。野兽们把全村男女老少都集合在村外广场上，要找出八路军及抗日工作人员。其实，这样的举动日本鬼子到处不知干过多少次了。它们往往是当众惨杀妇女和小孩，或者把老百姓集体射杀，人们至死也不会把八路军或抗日工作人员说出来的。这次，因为日本人带着告密的汉奸，使十几个抗日工作人员被敌人发现了。我二哥是八路军的侦察员，敌人当场拿他枪杀示众。我的十七岁的姐姐被日寇野兽奸污后，又被野兽们用手榴弹把她炸死。当时我才十三岁，日寇野兽说我是小八路，将我双脚倒置，摔到水坑里。我的大哥和三哥也被日寇抓去。我家的房子也被烧光了。母亲为营救我哥哥，被野兽们连牙齿都打掉了。大哥被日寇押到矿山去做苦工；三哥向来勇敢、刚强，终于在夜间抓破牢窗，逃出后就参加了八路军。当我稍大之后，为了替二哥和姊姊报仇，也参加了咱们八路军，一直到现在。
    过去，一提到日寇野兽我就红了眼；而对美国帝国主义我却有些认识不清，我还觉得日寇和美国帝国主义总是两回事。但事实一次一次教育了我，在历史上，近百年来美帝国主义和日寇始终互相勾结和我国为敌；美国帝国主义以日本为基地，利用日本的物力、人力，侵略朝鲜；现在又进一步准备单独对日媾和，重新武装日本。我们是决不能让日寇再来糟害我们的。我是一个人民解放军的战士，我将加紧学习近代化军事技术，以充实国防力量。
