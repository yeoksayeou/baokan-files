Xinhua News Agency, March 19th—American monopoly capitalists, who are profiting from the bloody war, not only determine the Truman administration's policies of aggressive war but also directly participate in the execution of the "mobilization plan" for war preparations.

The Director of the Defense Mobilization Agency, Wilson, who currently holds the power to militarize the American economy, is a representative of the Morgan Consortium and was formerly the General Manager of General Electric. Wilson has installed representatives from America's largest companies and banks in his agency. He has two main assistants: one is General Clay, a director of the largest Continental Can Company in the United States and former US military governor of Germany, and the other is Weinberg, a major shareholder in Goldman Sachs. House, a representative of Forster Land Development Company, serves as Wilson's economic advisor. Within the Defense Mobilization Agency, the Director of the Defense Production Administration, Harrison, was originally the General Manager of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. The Director of the Economic Stabilization Agency, Johnston, is the former President of the US Chamber of Commerce and the President of the National Motion Picture Association. The Director of the Wage Stabilization Board, Chin, who is in charge of restricting workers' wages, was originally the head of DuPont's US Rubber Company. Outside the Defense Mobilization Agency, another important institution manipulating war production, the Munitions Board of the Department of Defense, is also controlled by representatives of American monopoly enterprises. The Director, Small, was originally the General Manager of Maxon Food Company and the Vice President of Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corporation, and the Deputy Director, Van Yarden, was originally the Deputy General Manager of Dun & Bradstreet. Because these people have such close ties with large companies, some of them are not paid by the government but are paid directly by their original companies.

It is not difficult to imagine what the American war preparation economic institutions under the control of these people will do. Shannon, a Washington correspondent for the New York Post, said: "It is safe to bet that no economic legislation, tax bill, or price control bill will be implemented unless it provides various conveniences and benefits to the business community."

What these institutions are most concerned about is providing huge profits to American capitalists through military order contracts, raw material allocations, loans, and subsidies. New York Post reporter Shannon described the ugly inside story of American "big business vultures" vying for profits in Washington, saying: "In defense agencies, there are businessmen on both sides of the desks. Businessmen are desperately trying to get their friends to participate in various government industrial committees and hold decisive positions. Major competing companies are fighting for power and profit inside and outside the government." The New York Post said in an editorial: Washington is filled with a "desperate pursuit of profit atmosphere," a "petty atmosphere." American government agencies are such a market. And the "prosperity" of this market is built on the poverty of the broad masses of working people.

### 美国政府机关就是市场  办公桌两边都是商人  垄断资本家直接操纵“动员计划”

　　美国政府机关就是市场
    办公桌两边都是商人
    垄断资本家直接操纵“动员计划”
    【新华社十九日讯】在血腥的战争中发财的美国垄断资本家，不仅决定着杜鲁门政府的侵略战争政策，而且直接参与执行备战的“动员计划”。
    目前掌握使美国经济军国主义化的大权的国防动员署署长威尔生，就是摩根财团的代表，曾任通用电气公司总经理。威尔生把美国最大公司与银行的代表安插在他的机关中。他有两个主要助手：一个是美国最大的大陆罐头公司的董事、前美驻德军政府总督克莱将军，另一个是哥德曼·萨契斯公司的大股东威因柏。福尔斯特土地开发公司的代表豪斯担任威尔生的经济顾问。在国防动员署内，国防生产局局长哈里逊原任国际电话电报公司的总经理。经济稳定局局长蒋士顿是前美国商会主席及全国电影协会会长。专管限制工人工资的工资稳定局局长秦氏，原为杜邦的美国橡胶公司的负责人。在国防动员署之外，另一个重要的操纵备战生产的机构——国防部军火局，也由美国垄断企业的代表所控制，局长斯摩尔原为马克逊食品公司的总经理和伊默姆逊无线电照片公司的副总经理，副局长范亚丹原为邓恩·勃拉特斯特里公司的副总经理。由于这些人和大公司的联系是如此密切，他们中间有些人并不是向政府支取薪金的，而是直接地向原来的公司支取薪金的。
    在这些人支配下的美国备战经济机构会做出些什么，人们是不难想像的。纽约邮报驻华盛顿的记者香农说：“无论什么经济立法、捐税法案以及物价管制法案，如不给予商界种种便利和好处，就一件也不会付诸实施，这是可以打赌的。”
    这些机构所最关心的乃是通过军事定货合同、原料分配额、贷款、补助金等方式，给予美国资本家以巨额利润。纽约邮报记者香农描写美国“大企业兀鹰”在华盛顿争夺利润的丑恶内幕说：“在国防机构中，办公桌子的两边都是商人。商人们拚命钻营，使他们的朋友们参加政府的各种工业委员会，担任具有决定性的要职。互相竞争的各大公司之间，在政府内外争权夺利。”纽约邮报在社论中说：华盛顿弥漫着“拚命谋利的气氛”、“市侩的气氛”。美国政府机构就是这样的一个市场。而这个市场的“繁荣”，是建立在广大劳动人民的贫穷上的。
