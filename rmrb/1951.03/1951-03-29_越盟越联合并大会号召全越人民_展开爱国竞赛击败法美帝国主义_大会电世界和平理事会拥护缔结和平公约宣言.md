Its goals are: to eliminate the French colonialists, defeat the American interventionists, punish the traitors, establish an independent, unified, democratic, free, prosperous, and strong Vietnam, and help defend world peace and democracy. Therefore, the tasks of the Lien Viet Front are: to unite all the Vietnamese people to carry out armed resistance and national construction, to support the people's government and defend world peace; to reflect the needs of the people to the government and help the government implement policies beneficial to the people and the country; to publicize the policies of the Lien Viet Front and the People's Government, and mobilize the people to thoroughly implement these policies; to develop the people's abilities, to educate the people with the rights and obligations of citizens, and so on.

The declaration calls on soldiers of the regular army, local troops, militia, and guerrillas to compete with each other to defeat the invaders. Workers, peasants, and intellectuals should launch patriotic emulation to increase production. The declaration also calls on the petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie, landlords, the people in enemy-occupied areas, and overseas Vietnamese to actively support the war of resistance and serve the motherland.

The declaration points out that the future of imperialism is becoming increasingly bleak and the strength of the Vietnamese people is growing stronger, and then states: The Lien Viet Front, confident in the future, is determined to uphold President Ho Chi Minh's policy of broad national unity and lead the Vietnamese people to complete victory.
