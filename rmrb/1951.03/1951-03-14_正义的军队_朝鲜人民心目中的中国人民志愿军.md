The Army of Justice
　　——The Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Eyes of the Korean People
　　Xu Xiong
　　The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has won the infinite love and honor of the Korean people with its noble qualities. Kim Ki-soo, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Gangwon-do Labor Party, said: "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, like the Soviet Red Army, is the savior of the Korean people and the pillar of world peace." On their homeland, the Korean people have witnessed the cannibalistic brutality of the American invading army, and also the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army that aids the Korean people in resisting aggression. They clearly understand who to hate and who to love. The Korean people will never forget the great assistance the Chinese people have given them in their arduous struggle. Young students record their first meeting with the Volunteer Army in their diaries or notebooks, farmers proudly tell how they helped the Volunteer Army transport military grain, and mothers tell their children stories of the Volunteer Army defeating the American soldiers. Among the millions of letters of appreciation sent to the Volunteer Army soldiers, one from the people of Yongtang-ri, Munchon, says: "When we can sleep on our warm heated floors and feed our children, we remember the Volunteer Army comrades. We thank you. You are the hope of peace-loving mankind. We will definitely redouble our efforts to fight for the liberation of our country."
　　The Korean people have compiled and printed the heroic battles and strict discipline of the Volunteer Army into teaching materials and books, or written them into news and articles and published them in newspapers. These deeds are inspiring the Korean people's fighting will. A commander of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army said: "Every soldier of the People's Army, when they think of how the Chinese Volunteer Army comrades fighting alongside them generously dedicate their lives for the freedom of the Korean people, they bravely strike at the enemy even more." A commander of a certain unit of the People's Army told a story of a Volunteer Army soldier in the Battle of Gaecheon. This soldier captured a battalion commander of the Li puppet army. The puppet battalion commander took out his watch and money to give to him, but was sternly refused by the soldier. The Volunteer Army soldier said: "What I want are your soldiers, not these things." As a result, he forced the puppet battalion commander to call all his puppet soldiers to surrender. Many soldiers of the People's Army know this story, and they say: "This is our good example." Li Bing-wen, a Korean teacher who studied in the United States, said: "Except for the Soviet Red Army, I have never seen any army that can be as brave and invincible as the Volunteer Army, and as close to the foreign people as brothers and sisters." He said: "This is the army of justice."
　　The people of Sia-ri at the foot of Hwangchoryeong Mountain remember another story: In the Battle of Guturi, the American invading army drove the Korean people in front as shields; in order to avoid harming the people, the Volunteer Army soldiers took great risks, not using rifles and machine guns, but only using grenades and bayonets to defeat the enemy and rescue the Korean people. In the same place, the Volunteer Army soldiers braved the bombing of twenty enemy planes, rushed into the burning house, and carried out the elderly and children.
　　When the Volunteer Army soldiers passed through areas that had been occupied by the American invading army, they saw the tragic state of the American invaders massacring and plundering the people, and they all automatically pooled money and supplies to help the local people, which deeply moved the Korean people. The farmers of Samhap-ri treasured the money donated to them by the Volunteer Army. One farmer said: "We cannot spend this money casually, this is the sincerity of the Chinese Volunteer Army comrades." The same praise also came from the staff of the North Korean People's Government, who praised the Volunteer Army for being brave and good at fighting, disciplined, kind in attitude, respectful of government laws and regulations, and clear in procedures. The coal miners in Cheonnae-ri wrote on their wall newspaper: "When we see the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, we see the noble qualities of the international working people."
　　The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has won lofty honor and the unparalleled love and support of the Korean people with their heroic actions and excellent qualities. When the Korean people heard the imperialists shamelessly slander the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor," they angrily and contemptuously said: "Who is occupying our territory, killing our parents and brothers, and bombing our cities and villages? Who is helping us fight against the aggressors with selfless friendship? The Korean people can see clearly. We know who are our relatives and who are our enemies!"

　　正义的军队
    ——朝鲜人民心目中的中国人民志愿军
      徐熊
    中国人民志愿军以自己的崇高的品质，博得了朝鲜人民无限敬爱的荣誉。江原道劳动党宣传部副部长金基洙说：“中国人民志愿军和苏联红军一样，是朝鲜人民的救星，是保卫世界和平的支柱。”朝鲜人民在祖国的土地上，亲眼看到残暴的美国侵略军吃人生番，也看到援助朝鲜人民反抗侵略的英勇的中国人民志愿军。他们清楚地懂得谁该恨，谁该爱。朝鲜人民永远不会忘记在他们艰苦的搏斗里，中国人民所给予他们的伟大援助。年青的学生在日记或作文簿上记下与志愿军初次会面的情景，农民们骄傲地说他怎样帮助志愿军运送军粮，母亲们向孩子们讲志愿军打败美国兵的故事。在千万封送到志愿军战士手中的慰问信中，有一封文川龙溏里人民写的信，里面说：“当我们能在自己暖和的热炕上睡觉，能给孩子们喂奶的时候，我们就记起志愿军的同志们。我们感谢你们。你们是爱好和平的人类的希望。我们一定加倍为解放祖国而奋斗。”
    朝鲜人民已经把志愿军英勇作战、纪律严明的事迹，编印成教材、书籍，或写成新闻和文章在报纸上发表。这些事迹都在鼓舞着朝鲜人民的斗争意志。朝鲜人民军某部指挥员说：“每一个人民军的战士，当他们想到与他们并肩作战的中国志愿军同志如何慷慨地为朝鲜人民的自由而献出生命的时候，他们就更加勇敢地打击敌人。”人民军某部指挥员讲了一个志愿军战士在价川战斗中的故事。这个战士捉到一个李伪军大队长。伪大队长拿出表和钱来给他，被这个战士严词拒绝。志愿军战士说：“我要的是你的士兵，不要这些东西。”结果迫使伪大队长把他的全大队伪军都叫过来投降了。人民军的许多战士都知道这个故事，他们说：“这是我们的好榜样。”一位曾留学美国的朝鲜教师李炳文说：“除去苏联红军，我没见过任何军队能像志愿军这样英勇无敌，和外国人民亲如手足。”他说：“这是正义的军队。”
    黄草岭山下面系厦里的人民牢记着另一个故事：在古土里战斗中，美国侵略军把朝鲜人民赶在前面作掩护；志愿军战士们为了避免伤害人民，冒了极大的危险，不用步枪和机枪，仅仅用手榴弹和刺刀打败了敌人，抢救出了朝鲜人民。在同一个地方，志愿军战士们曾冒了二十架敌机的轰炸，冲入着火的房子，背出老人和孩子。
    志愿军战士们在经过曾遭美国侵略军侵占过的地区的时候，看到了美国侵略者残杀和劫掠人民的惨状，纷纷自动凑集金钱和物品，救济当地人民，这使朝鲜人民深受感动。三洽里农民们把志愿军捐赠给他们的钱珍贵地保存起来。一位农民说：“这些钱我们不能随便用掉，这是中国志愿军同志的一片诚心。”同样的盛赞也来自朝鲜北部人民政府的工作人员们，他们称赞志愿军英勇善战，纪律严明，态度和蔼，尊重政府法令，手续清楚。川内里的石炭工人们，在他们的墙报上写道：“看到中国人民志愿军，我们就看到了国际劳动人民的高贵品质。”
    中国人民志愿军用自己的英勇行动和优秀品质，取得了崇高的荣誉，获得了朝鲜人民的无比热爱和拥护。当朝鲜人民听到帝国主义者可耻地诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的时候，他们愤怒而鄙视地说：“是谁在侵占我们国土，杀死我们的父母兄弟，轰炸我们的城市乡村？是谁在以无私的友谊援助我们打击侵略者？朝鲜人民都看得清清楚楚。我们知道谁是亲人，谁是仇敌！”
