　　Enterprise Party Committees Should Emphasize Leadership of the Ma Hengchang Group Movement
　　By Our Correspondent Pei Lan
　　Since the Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Group issued its challenge to workers across the country, two different phenomena have emerged in Beijing's enterprises: one is that, thanks to the active leadership of the Party and trade unions, over seven hundred groups in some factories have risen to accept the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Group. Moreover, the groups that have accepted the challenge include not only workers but also technicians, engineers, clerks, and even workers' family members. This has led to a deeper and more extensive patriotic production campaign in these enterprises.
　　After seeing the challenge letter from the Ma Hengchang Group to workers nationwide, the General Party Branch of the Beijing Water Company paid attention to cultivating "Ma Hengchang Groups" within the company and assigned this task to the trade union. Fan Wenhua, the trade union secretary, read the challenge to the workers of the water meter section, encouraging them to discuss and understand the significance and role of the Ma Hengchang Group movement, and encouraged them to accept the challenge. Gao Shen, the general branch secretary, also personally conducted propaganda and mobilization work among all Party members in the water meter section, calling on everyone to enthusiastically participate in the Ma Hengchang Group movement. The workers in the water meter section confidently accepted the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Group and drew up a "Labor Pact." Now, the General Branch Committee of the Water Company is still urging the trade union to help other groups accept the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Group. The General Party Branch Committee of the Beijing Tram Company promptly printed the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group and the call of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions to launch the Ma Hengchang Group movement into a special page, distributed it to various factories and repair shops along the lines, and called on all Party members to study hard and take the lead in accepting the challenge. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant already has 278 groups accepting the challenge, accounting for 70 percent of the total number of groups in the plant; the Shijingshan Power Plant has 44 groups accepting the challenge, accounting for 40 percent of the total number of groups in the plant; and the Liulihe Cement Plant has 40 groups accepting the challenge, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of groups in the plant.
　　In just over a month, some groups have established reading groups (strengthening the study of current events is one of the conditions for accepting the challenge). In the Shijingshan Power Plant, which previously subscribed to only seven copies of the Worker's Daily for the entire plant, the number has increased to 52 after accepting the challenge. Because these workers have strengthened their study of current affairs, they have a deeper understanding of the conspiracy of American imperialism to wage aggressive wars, and their level of class consciousness has been raised. This is the ideological foundation for ensuring the in-depth development of the patriotic production competition movement. Since accepting the challenge, the Zhang Fengquan Group of the Hua North Agricultural Machinery General Plant's lathe workshop has adhered to the technical research meeting system and has continuously improved three types of tools. The 90-degree nozzle tool improved by the group increased work efficiency by 430 percent. After accepting the challenge, the Zheng Yuqian Group of the weaving department of the Qinghe Woolen Mill united all the elderly and young workers in the group, learned techniques from each other, and insisted on holding a trade union group meeting every week to check the production situation. Their group increased production from 15.5 meters of blankets per person per ten hours to over 18 meters, and guaranteed 100 percent first-class products. Therefore, Bu Ke, the general branch secretary of the Qinghe Woolen Mill, said: "If the factory's general branch committee and trade union can lead this movement well, it can not only increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs, but also solve other problems in the workshop." This is a correct assessment.
　　However, there is another phenomenon, that is, the Party committees, branches, and trade unions of some factories have abandoned their leadership of this movement. Although some groups have spontaneously risen to accept the challenge, they lack leadership and the core role of the Party. Not only have they failed to mobilize more intermediate and backward groups to form a broader mass movement, but they have also caused these groups that have already accepted the challenge to fall into a state of drift.
　　The reason why the Party committees of these factories underestimate the Ma Hengchang Group movement is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the Ma Hengchang Group movement. For example, individual responsible comrades said: "We have not yet studied what role the Ma Hengchang Group has played and what problems it has solved!" In June and July of last year, the Industrial Branch Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC concentrated its efforts to lead the Party committees of various enterprises to launch a vigorous production competition movement in factories. Why did the Party do this at that time? A responsible comrade from the Industrial Branch Department said: "Because at that time, there were serious problems such as high costs and low quality in various factories and enterprises, and these problems must be solved through competition." However, they did not realize that the Ma Hengchang Group is a typical example of creating the elimination of waste products and improving quality. Carrying out the Ma Hengchang Group movement is precisely to make the patriotic production competition movement wider and deeper.
　　Precisely because of the lack of leadership in this movement in some enterprises, the workers' incorrect understanding of the Ma Hengchang Group has not been corrected, which has affected the development of the Ma Hengchang Group movement. For example, some workers said: "Our factory's name is not well-known, and even if we make achievements, we won't be able to get it in the newspaper!" Some workers also said: "The Ma Hengchang Group is a nationally renowned group, how dare we challenge them!" Some factory workers believe: "The Ma Hengchang Group uses machines to manufacture products, so his experience cannot be used in our industry." Individual dredging workers from the Sanitation Engineering Team said: "Dredging work cannot learn from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group."
　　In addition, it is also because some Party committees still mechanically separate Party work from production work. Some Party committees believe that they are currently rectifying the Party's organization, and the trade unions are conducting re-elections and selecting models, so they do not have time to do this work. Some people said: "We are currently busy with other work, let's accept the challenge in a few days!" Bi Songling, a production committee member of the Trade Union of the Electric Power Management Bureau, suppressed the challenge letter of the Cai Youyu Group of the Outside Line Team of the Communications Section of the Bureau's Operations Department for 21 days without processing it. Yes, in addition to ensuring and supervising the task of production, the Party must also carry out some Party work, but it must be recognized that these two tasks are not contradictory. Ensuring and supervising production is the main and regular task of the enterprise Party, and organizing rectification is precisely to better complete this task. At the same time, the Party's leadership of this movement does not necessarily require it to do a lot of administrative work. The main thing is that the Party committee should discuss and study this work, make decisions, or help the trade union formulate a plan for implementation. Didn't the Party committees of the Shijingshan Power Plant and others lead this movement?
　　It is said that the Industrial Branch Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee is now beginning to pay attention to the leadership of this movement. This is good. It is hoped that the Industrial Branch Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee can quickly correct the erroneous thinking of some enterprise Party committees that underestimate this movement, so that the Ma Hengchang Group movement can be rapidly and universally developed.

### 企业党委应当重视对马恒昌小组运动的领导

　　企业党委应当重视对马恒昌小组运动的领导
    本报记者  培蓝
    自从马恒昌先进生产小组向全国各地职工提出挑战后，北京市的企业中，就出现了两种不同的现象：一种是有一部分工厂由于党、工会积极的领导，有七百多个小组起来向马恒昌小组应战。而且应战的小组，不仅有工人，而且有技术人员、工程师、职员及职工家属等。这些企业中的爱国主义生产竞赛运动也就更加深入与广泛。
    中共自来水公司总支部，在看到马恒昌小组给全国职工的挑战书后，便注意在本公司培养“马恒昌小组”，并把这一任务交给了工会。工会秘书范文华同志便向水表股小组工友读报，启发他们讨论，认识开展马恒昌小组运动的意义和作用，并鼓励他们应战。总支书记高深同志，也亲自向水表股小组全体党员进行宣传鼓动工作，号召大家热烈参加马恒昌小组运动。水表股小组工友非常有信心地向马恒昌小组应战了，并订出了“劳动公约”。现在自来水公司总支委员会还在督促工会，帮助其他小组向马恒昌小组应战。中共北京市电车公司总支委员会，及时地把马恒昌小组的经验及北京市总工会开展马恒昌小组运动的号召，印成专页，分发给车路各厂及修造厂，并号召全体党员应该好好学习，带头应战。石景山钢铁厂已有二百七十八个小组应战，占全厂小组总数的百分之七十；石景山发电厂有四十四个小组应战，占全厂小组总数的百分之四十；琉璃河水泥厂四十个小组应战，占全厂小组总数的百分之八十。
    在短短的一个多月中，有一部分小组已建立了读报组（加强对时事的学习是应战的条件之一）。石景山发电厂过去全厂只订七份工人日报，应战以后，全厂已增至五十二份。这些职工，由于加强了时事学习，更深刻地认识了美帝国主义进行侵略战争的阴谋，提高了阶级觉悟程度。这是保证深入开展爱国主义生产竞赛运动的思想基础。华北农业机械总厂车工间张凤泉小组自应战以来，坚持了技术研究会议制度，连续改进了三种工具。该组改进的喷雾器九十度嘴的工具，提高工作效率百分之四百三十。清河制呢厂机织部郑玉谦小组应战后，团结了全组老年、青年工人，互相学习技术，坚持了每星期开一次工会小组会，检查生产情形。他们小组由每人每十小时织十五·五公尺毛毯，提高到十八公尺以上，并保证了百分之百的一等品。因此清河制呢厂的总支书记布克同志说：“工厂的总支委员会和工会，如果能够很好的领导这一运动，不仅能够增加生产，提高质量，降低成本，并且车间的其他问题，都可以得到解决了。”这是正确的评价。
    但是，还有另一种现象，即有一部分工厂的党委、支部、工会对这一运动放弃了领导，虽然有一部分小组自发地起来应战了，但因缺乏领导与党的核心作用。不仅没有将更多的中间和落后的小组带动起来，形成更广泛的群众运动，并且使这些已应战的小组也陷入于自流状态中。
    这些工厂的党委所以轻视马恒昌小组运动，主要是对马恒昌小组运动认识不足之故。例如有个别负责同志说：“马恒昌小组到底起了些什么作用，解决了些什么问题，我们尚未研究！”去年六、七月份，中共北京市委会的工支科曾集中力量，领导各企业党委在工厂展开了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛运动。当时党为什么要这样作呢？工支科的一位负责同志说：“因为当时各工厂、企业存在着严重的成本高、质量低等等问题，要解决这些问题，必须通过竞赛运动。”但是，他们没有认识，马恒昌小组正是创造消灭废品、提高质量的一个典型。开展马恒昌小组运动，正是为了使爱国主义生产竞赛运动更加广宽与深入。
    正由于在某些企业中缺乏对这一运动的领导，工人中对马恒昌小组的错误认识得不到纠正，就影响了马恒昌小组运动的展开。例如有的工人说：“咱们厂子的名字不响，作出成绩也登不了报！”还有些工人说：“马恒昌小组是全国闻名的小组，我们怎敢和人家应战！”有的工厂工人认为：“马恒昌小组是用机器制造成品的，因此他的经验，我们这行用不上。”卫生工程队个别淘挖工人说：“淘挖工作可不能学习马恒昌小组的先进经验。”
    另外，也因为至今还有些党委把党务工作和生产工作机械的分开。有些党委认为现在正在整顿党的组织，工会正在进行改选、评选模范，都没有时间来作这一工作。有些人就这样说：“我们现在正在忙着别的工作呢，过些日子再应战吧！”电业管理总局工会生产委员毕松龄同志，就把总局运行处通讯科外线班蔡又玉小组的应战书，压了二十一天没有处理。是的，党除了保证与监督生产的任务外，还要进行一些党务工作，但是必须认识这两个工作是不矛盾的。对生产的保证与监督是企业党的主要的经常的任务，整理组织也正是为了更好地完成这一个任务。同时党对这一运动的领导，并不是一定要去作许多事务工作，主要是党委会应讨论研究这一工作，作出决定或帮助工会制订出进行的计划步骤。石景山发电厂等党委，不是领导了这一运动吗？
    据说北京市委会工支科现已开始注意到对这一运动的领导。这是好的。希望北京市委工支科，能够很快将某些企业党委的轻视这一运动的错误思想予以纠正，使马恒昌小组运动，迅速地普遍地开展起来。
