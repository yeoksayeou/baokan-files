Cattle Plague Occurs in More Than Ten Counties and Cities in Lan County, Shanxi Province
Spread Halted in Some Areas After Emergency Prevention and Control

[This newspaper dispatch] A cattle plague has occurred in more than ten counties and cities, including Lan County and Kelan County in Shanxi Province, and has spread to some villages in Jingxing and Huolu counties in Hebei Province. After local governments at all levels took emergency measures and carried out treatment, the cattle plague has stopped spreading in some individual counties and districts, but it still tends to continue spreading. This is a major event that should be given serious attention in various places as the spring plowing season approaches.

The cattle plague has been repeatedly inspected by veterinarians and confirmed to be true cattle plague (also known as swollen gall bladder disease, dry omasum swollen gall bladder disease, rotten intestine disease), which spreads extremely rapidly. Since it occurred in Lan County and Kelan County, Shanxi Province at the end of November last year, it has spread northward to Ningwu and Jingle, and southward to more than fifty villages in six counties and cities, including Jinyuan and Taiyuan City. Up to now, it has spread to more than ten counties and cities, and in early February it spread to six villages in Jingxing and Huolu counties in Hebei. As of mid-February, according to incomplete statistics from six counties and cities in Shanxi Province, more than 300 head of draught cattle had died; in the six villages of Jingxing and Huolu, 47 head of draught cattle died one after another in just about twenty days. This will not only affect the spring plowing production in the areas where the cattle plague has occurred, but also poses a great threat to the rural areas in the vicinity.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government attached great importance to the cattle plague in Shanxi after receiving the report, and urgently telegraphed the following instructions: (1) The special commissioner's offices and county governments in the areas where the cattle plague has occurred must regard the eradication work as the current top priority, and the principal leaders must be responsible, personally lead, organize blockades, cut off human and animal traffic, and direct the epidemic prevention team to carry out prevention; (2) Concentrate epidemic prevention personnel (including traditional Chinese veterinarians), and carry out a surprise rabbit-adapted cattle plague vaccine preventive injection in the area surrounding the epidemic area to encircle the epidemic area and prevent it from spreading; (3) After the preventive injection is successful and there is surplus capacity, then enter the epidemic area for treatment. The ministry also sent important cadres in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine to the province to understand the situation of cattle plague prevention and treatment and the problems existing in the work. At the same time, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government also issued emergency instructions and actively prepared medicines and organized more than 50 specialized veterinarians to go to the areas where the cattle plague has occurred to cooperate with governments and veterinary personnel at all levels in carrying out prevention and treatment work. In Hebei, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office also took emergency measures and carried out organized and step-by-step work to eradicate the cattle plague.

In the emergency prevention and control work carried out in various places, the cattle plague in Jinyuan County and the third district of the suburbs of Taiyuan City has basically stopped spreading. After the third and fourth districts in the suburbs of Taiyuan City discovered the cattle plague, they immediately established a cattle plague prevention and control committee and mobilized a large number of veterinary personnel to go to the countryside to carry out universal epidemic prevention injections for draught cattle. As of mid-February, 3,484 head of draught cattle had been vaccinated. Since the injection, there have been no more cattle deaths in the third district. After the veterinary prevention and treatment team of Jinyuan County arrived in the township, it adopted the method of external prevention and internal treatment: one epidemic prevention team went to the villages with serious disasters to carry out serum injections, and the remaining main force was assigned to the villages around the epidemic area to carry out universal preventive injections, and then gradually expanded the epidemic prevention area and blockaded the epidemic area. Then, it divided the county into thirteen key prevention and treatment villages and organized all draught cattle for universal epidemic prevention injections. As of February 16, 2,084 of the 2,317 draught cattle in the county had been injected, and 10 of the 15 sick cattle that had been treated had been saved. At present, the cattle plague in the county has basically stopped spreading.

　　山西省岚县等十余县市发生牛瘟
    经紧急防治后部分地区已停止发展
    【本报讯】山西省岚县、岢岚等十余县、市发生牛瘟，并已蔓延至河北省井陉、获鹿两县的部分村庄。经过当地各级人民政府采取紧急措施、进行救治后，个别县、区的牛瘟虽已停止发展，但目前仍有继续蔓延的趋势。这是目前春耕季节即将到来的时候，亟应引起各地严重注意的一件大事。
    此次牛瘟经兽医多次检查，证实为真性牛瘟（也叫胀胆症、干百叶胀胆症、烂肠症），蔓延极为迅速。自去年十一月末，山西岚县、岢岚两县发生后，随即向北蔓延至宁武、静乐，向南蔓延至晋源及太原市等六县、市五十余村。至目前止，已发展至十余县、市，二月初并已传至河北井陉、获鹿两县的六个村庄。截至二月中旬，据山西省六个县、市的不完全统计，已死耕牛三百余头；井陉、获鹿的六个村庄，仅二十天左右，即相继死去耕牛四十七头。这不仅将影响到已发生牛瘟各地的春耕生产，而且对附近地区农村也是一个很大的威胁。
    对于山西此次牛瘟，中央人民政府农业部得到报告后，极为重视，并急电指示了以下几点：（一）发生牛瘟地区的专署、县府必须以扑灭工作为当前急务，必须首长负责，亲自领导，组织封锁，断绝人畜交通，并指挥防疫队进行预防；（二）集中防疫人员（包括中兽医），在疫区周围突击作兔化牛瘟疫苗预防注射，包围疫区，勿使蔓延；（三）俟预防注射有成绩并有余力时，再进入疫区治疗。该部又派畜牧兽医方面的重要干部到该省了解牛瘟防治的情况和工作中存在的问题。同时，山西省人民政府也一面发出紧急指示，一面积极筹备药品并组织专门兽医五十余名到已发生牛瘟地区，协同各级政府与兽医人员进行防治工作。在河北方面，石家庄专署亦采取了紧急措施，进行了有组织有步骤的扑灭牛瘟工作。
    在各地实施紧急防治的工作中，晋源县和太原市郊区三区的牛瘟已基本停止蔓延。太原市郊区第三、四两区当发现牛瘟后，立即成立防治牛瘟委员会，并调集大批兽医人员下乡，首先进行耕牛普遍防疫注射，截至二月中旬，已完成三千四百八十四头耕牛防疫注射。自注射后，第三区即再无死牛现象发生。晋源县的兽医防治队到乡后，采取外防内治的办法：分一个防疫组到灾情严重村进行血清注射，其余大部力量，则分配到疫区周围村庄普遍注射预防针，再逐渐扩大防疫面积，封锁疫区。然后又在全县划分十三个重点防治村，组织所有耕牛进行普遍的防疫注射。截至二月十六日，全县二千三百一十七头耕牛，已注射完二千零八十四头，另外经过治疗的十五头病牛，已有十头保住性命。目前该县牛瘟已基本停止蔓延。
