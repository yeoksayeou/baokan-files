　　The Beginning of a New Yi-Han Relationship
    Our newspaper reporter with the Southwest visiting delegation, Shen Shi
    "Officials occupy the flatlands, Han people occupy the slopes, driving us Yi people to the mountain hollows." This folk song, popular among the Yi people during the reactionary rule, expressed their centuries of accumulated grievances. Crossing the Dadu River and entering Yuexi County, the desolate high mountains are dotted with villages inhabited by Yi compatriots. The houses are short and collapsed, with no windows, and dark inside. The roofs are covered with uneven wooden planks, which cannot block the wind or rain, nor prevent sunlight from penetrating through the cracks. People, cattle, chickens, and pigs all live in the same room. When you think of the Yi brothers huddled to one side, wearing "Cha'erwa" (capes woven from wool), eating buckwheat and potatoes, without oil or salt, living such extremely impoverished lives for generations, it will surely arouse your sympathy and curse the sins committed by the bloody hands of the reactionary rulers.
    "To see a barbarian, not to punish even a third of his crimes," successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandit gangs used this traditional policy of high-handed oppression to treat the Yi people. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the great butcher Zhao Erfeng attacked the Yi areas from Leibo (Sichuan Province) and Zhaojue (Xikang Province), building Zhaojue City to flaunt his invincible "achievements." In 1935, the reactionary warlord Li Jiayu attacked Puxiong, forcing the local Yi people to provide 2,000 shi of grain and 10,000 taels of silver as so-called "surrender fees." The Kuomintang bandit army stationed in Yuexi destroyed the village of Yimucun. In 1946, the Kuomintang bandit gang, He Guoguang's troops, attacked Puxiong, sending planes to bomb it, which was met with strong resistance from the local people. Hei Yi chieftains Ahou Lumu Zi and Guo Ji Mada demanded a cessation of the attack, but were imprisoned in Xichang City. They paid 5,000 taels of silver and sent their children to Xichang as hostages before being released. The late Deng Xiuting, the great local tyrant of Mianning County (Xikang Province), was an even more brutal executioner who slaughtered Yi people. To this day, the people of Yuexi can still point out how many Yi heads were once hung on a certain tree in Yuexi City. The cruel oppression of the reactionary rulers caused widespread hatred of Han people among the Yi people, leading to frequent retaliatory acts of arson and murder. With such deep divisions between the Yi and Han people, Han people dared not enter the Yi areas, fearing being captured and made "waizi" (slaves); Yi people also dared not go to distant towns to attend markets, fearing punishment by Han people.
    The Kuomintang bandit gang and the local tyrants of Xichang, on the one hand, used slaughter and suppression to treat the Yi people, and on the other hand, used cunning tricks to deceive them. They said, "To deal with the barbarians, you must wear velvet gloves on iron hands." They took advantage of the Yi people's kind and honest nature, using flowery words to coax the Hei Yi chieftains, recognizing their children as adopted sons and drinking blood wine with them, softening the Yi people in order to buy opium and collect grain at high prices in the Yi areas, to make a fortune. When the Yi people could not bear it and rose up in resistance, the local tyrants would deceive the Hei Yi representatives to go to county towns for meetings, holding them as hostages, making it impossible for the Yi people to resist.
    "To have a peaceful year, unless barbarians kill barbarians." The Kuomintang bandit gang and the local tyrants of Xichang consistently used this vicious "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy to provoke internal slaughter among the Yi people. In 1942, the Deng bandit Xiuting incited a feud between the Wazha Puga branch and the Wazha Jisu branch of the same clan in Puxiong. Both sides destroyed more than a thousand houses and killed more than five thousand Hei and Bai Yi people. In the same year, the Deng bandit Xiuting again incited a feud between the Baqijiagu branch in Linmidi, the upper reaches of the Zhaojue River, and the Wazha Lugia branch. The Wazha Lugia branch burned all the houses of the Baqijiagu branch. This extremely evil policy of division and provocation caused disunity among the Yi people, with enemies unable to pass through each other's territories.
    The Kuomintang bandit gang and the local tyrants unanimously said: "The Yi people fear power but do not cherish virtue." Just imagine: under traditional suppression, provocation, and deception, what "virtue" was there for the Yi people to "cherish"? They also said: "The Yi nature is like dogs and sheep, fickle and inconstant." Just imagine: under traditional suppression, provocation, and deception, how could the Yi people not be deeply wary of these wolfish and tigerish reactionary rulers?
    The tragedies caused by successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandit gang finally came to an end with the liberation of the Xichang area. The People's Liberation Army and the working personnel of the People's Government who entered this area have taken on the sacred responsibility of eliminating the Yi-Han divide, promoting unity within the Yi nationality, and helping the Yi people enter a prosperous and happy life.
    The historical Yi-Han divide could not be eliminated overnight with the liberation of the Xichang area. In the early days of liberation, the broad masses of Yi compatriots had doubts and concerns about the People's Government. They dared not attend Yi people's forums in Yuexi, Xichang, and other places, fearing that they would be held hostage like the Kuomintang bandit gang had done. The Han feudal landlords in various counties took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that "the PLA is sweet at first but bitter later," and that "there will be a class struggle between the Hei and Bai Yi in the future." Therefore, for some Yi chieftains to attend the forums, it often required painstaking persuasion and explanation from the working personnel.
    After eight months of arduous work, the Xichang area has achieved certain successes in uniting the Yi and Han peoples and promoting unity within the Yi nationality, initially improving Yi-Han relations, and the Yi nationality has begun to unite. The thousand-mile-long road from Yuexi to Xichang, and from Xichang to Huili is now unobstructed. Single travelers no longer worry about being kidnapped, and the phenomena of fighting enemies, mutual robbery, and kidnapping of children have been greatly reduced. Hei Yi people voluntarily invite their enemies to drink wine, willing to forget old hatreds and reconcile from then on. In the past, robbery was rampant every winter, but last winter, social order was peaceful for the first time; the Yi compatriots happily spent the New Year. The local Yi and Han people all said: "The People's Government has been here for less than a year, and we are already living a good life. We are grateful to Chairman Mao, we thank the Communist Party!"
    The achievement of the above-mentioned results lies in the fact that the People's Governments at all levels and the People's Liberation Army in the Xichang area have correctly implemented the nationality policies in the Common Program; the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who entered the Yi areas have strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and have truly respected the customs and habits of the Yi people. For example, a certain unit of our army that advanced into the Daliang Mountains to suppress bandits did not live in Yi people's houses, and often camped in the wilderness; even when they could not find food along the way, they never took the potatoes and radishes planted by the Yi people. This excellent mass discipline greatly moved the Yi people.
    The Xichang Military Control Commission, based on the specific conditions of each county in the Xichang area, distinguished the priorities and carried out various tasks in a step-by-step manner. From Yuexi to the Yunnan border, along the narrow corridor of the Le (Shan) Xi (Chang) and Xi (Chang) Xiang (Yun) highways, there is a region where Han people are concentrated or where Yi and Han people live together. In the early days of the liberation of this area, although the Kuomintang reactionary regime had been destroyed, Han landlords and local tyrants still sat high on the heads of the Yi and Han people, spreading rumors and doing evil, or secretly organizing rebellions. Therefore, it became an indispensable and urgent task to eliminate bandits and special agents, oppose local tyrants, and carry out rent reduction in the Han areas. Only by defeating these reactionary forces can the Han and Yi people stand up.
    In the process of carrying out rent reduction and anti-local tyrant campaigns, the Yi and Han people recognized the crimes of the feudal landlords and great local tyrants in oppressing the Yi and Han people and carrying out divisive activities. The Yi people in the vicinity actively participated in the mass rallies in Xichang, Yuexi, and other places where peasants accused the Han landlords and local tyrants of their evils. At the mass rally in Zhongsuba, Yuexi, with more than 10,000 people, the Yi and Han people unanimously demanded the execution of Liao Chunbo, who had committed many evils. The counties of Xichang, Huili, Mianning, Yuexi, Yanyuan, and Yanbian resolutely suppressed the bandit and special agent ringleaders Zhang Weiying, Su Haicheng, Zhuge Shihua, and others; the people of each county all recognized that the past disunity between the Yi and Han people was caused by this group of people colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    Over the past eight months, the counties in the Xichang area have successively held Yi-Han people's forums and mass rallies, publicized nationality policies, formulated unity pacts, and stipulated the prohibition of fighting enemies, kidnapping Han people, and kidnapping children; Zhaojue has established a mediation committee composed of the heads of various Yi branches to mediate internal disputes within the Yi nationality.
    The working personnel sent to Daliang Mountain, Puge, Puxiong and other places in Xikang Province made every effort to persuade the Yi compatriots to unite internally; they do not accept any reward when mediating enemy disputes.
    At the end of last year, the Xichang Military Control Commission convened a people's representative conference of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the entire Xichang area, including Yi, Han, Hui, Tibetan, Li, and Su. Many representatives of Hei Yi chieftains from Niuniuba, Puxiong, Puge and other places were invited to attend. The representatives were warmly received by the Military Control Commission and respected by people from all walks of life. At the opening of the meeting, Yi women representative Yimu Niuniu received flowers and was moved to tears. In the old society, they were trampled underfoot and could not hold their heads high; today, they have become the masters of the new society, and they have personally realized that the minority nationalities have truly gained freedom and equality.
    The People's Government of Xikang Province and the People's Governments at all levels in the Xichang area have Yi cadres participating in the work. For example, Guoji Mugu of the People's Government of Xikang Province, Luo Daying, deputy county head of the People's Government of Xichang County, and Wazha Muji, deputy county head of Mianning County, are all Yi people.
    Xichang also has a minority nationality cadre training class, specializing in training Yi, Hui and other ethnic cadres. The general response of the Yi people is: The People's Government says what it does, and we Yi people have really seen the clear sky today. Wang Youfu, a Miao people from the Jinsha River, said at the Zhaojue Yi, Han, and Miao ethnic representative forum: "Our minority nationalities were like being locked in a dark room in the past. Chairman Mao opened the door for us, and we saw the sun, and saw beautiful flowers, grass, and trees. We must strengthen unity and build our great motherland."

### 彝汉新关系的开始

　　彝汉新关系的开始
    本报随西南访问团记者  沈石
    “官占坪，汉占坡，把我彝人赶上山窝窝。”这一首反动统治时期在彝区人民中间流行的歌谣，道出了他们千百年来积累的宿怨。一过大渡河，进入越嶲县境，荒凉的高山丛里，散布着彝族同胞居住的村落。矮塌塌的房屋，没有窗，里面黑洞洞的；屋顶盖的是凸凹不平的木板，挡不住风，遮不住雨，也阻不了日光从木缝中透入。人、牛、鸡、猪，全住在一间屋里。当你想到披着“插儿娃”（用羊毛织成的披风）蜷缩在一旁的彝族弟兄，他们吃着苦荞，吃着洋芋，没有油，没有盐，世世代代过着这样极度贫困的生活时，一定会引起你的同情，诅咒反动统治者血手造成的罪孽。
    “见蛮不惩三分罪”，历代封建皇朝和国民党匪帮就用这种传统的高压政策来对待彝族人民。清末，大屠夫赵尔丰从雷波（四川省）、昭觉（西康省）进攻彝区，建筑昭觉城，来炫耀他不可一世的“战绩”。一九三五年，反动军阀李家钰进攻普雄，强迫当地彝民出粮二千石，银一万两，作为所谓“投诚费”。驻在越嶲的国民党匪军，毁平了以母村。一九四六年，国民党匪帮贺国光部进攻普雄，出动飞机轰炸，遭到当地人民的强烈反抗；黑彝支头阿侯鲁木子、果鸡马达等要求停止进攻，被禁锢在西昌城，出银五千两，并送出子弟到西昌，作为人质，始得释放。已故冕宁县（西康省）大恶霸邓秀廷，更是屠杀彝民的凶残刽子手。到今天，越嶲人民还可指出越嶲城内某棵树上曾经挂过多少彝人头颅。反动统治者的残酷压迫，造成了彝人对汉人的普遍仇视，致经常发生相互报复的烧杀行为。彝汉人民隔阂既如此之深，汉人便不敢进入彝区，害怕被掳去做“娃子”；彝人也不敢到较远的城镇去赶场，恐汉人惩他们。
    国民党匪帮和西昌地区的恶霸，一方面使用屠杀、镇压手段对待彝人，一方面更用狡猾的手腕进行哄骗。他们说：“对付蛮子，要铁手戴上绒手套。”他们利用彝人善良老实的特点，花言巧语地哄骗各支头的黑彝，认他们的子弟为干儿子，和他们喝血酒，软化彝人，借以在彝区购买鸦片，高额征收粮食，来发横财。彝人忍受不了，起来反抗时，恶霸们就哄骗黑彝代表人物到各县城开会，将他们押作人质，使彝民无法反抗。
    “要过太平年，除非蛮杀蛮。”国民党匪帮和西昌地区的恶霸，一贯使用这一毒辣的“以夷制夷”政策，挑拨彝民内部残杀。一九四二年，邓匪秀廷挑起普雄瓦渣普呷支和瓦渣吉苏支的同宗族性的仇杀。双方互毁了千余户的房屋，死黑、白彝五千余人。同年，邓匪秀廷又挑拨昭觉河上游林密地的八齐甲谷支和瓦渣鲁呷支的仇杀。瓦渣鲁呷支将八齐甲谷支的房屋全部烧光。这种万恶的分化、挑拨政策，造成彝民内部的不团结，冤家和冤家，谁也不能通过所属的地界。
    国民党匪帮和恶霸众口一辞地说：“夷人畏威不怀德”。试想：在传统的镇压、挑拨、欺诈下，有什么“德”值得彝族人民可“怀”呢？他们又说：“夷性犬羊，反复无常”。试想：在传统的镇压、挑拨、欺诈下，彝族人民对于这些狼虎成性的反动统治者怎能不深怀戒心呢？
    历代封建皇朝和国民党匪帮所造成的惨剧，终于因西昌地区的解放而宣告结束。进入这一地区的人民解放军和人民政府的工作人员已担负起消除彝汉隔阂、促进彝族内部团结及帮助彝族人民进入繁荣幸福生活的神圣责任。
    历史性的彝汉隔阂，不可能因西昌地区刚获解放而一下消除。广大的彝胞在解放初期，对人民政府存在着怀疑和顾虑。他们不敢出席越嶲、西昌等地的彝族座谈会，怕像国民党匪帮那样押他们作人质。各县汉人封建地主更乘机造谣，说什么“解放军先甜后苦”，“将来会搞黑白彝阶级斗争”。因此，某些彝族支头出席座谈会，多要经过工作人员的苦口婆心的劝说和解释。
    经过八个月的艰苦工作，西昌地区已经在团结彝、汉人民及促进彝族内部团结方面，取得了一定的成绩，初步改善了彝汉关系，而彝族内部也开始团结起来。从越嶲到西昌，从西昌到会理千余里的大道，畅通无阻了。单身的旅客再不担心被掳了，打冤家、互相抢劫、抢娃子的现象大大减少了。黑彝自动请冤家喝酒，愿意不记旧仇，从此和解。过去每到冬季，抢劫之风盛行，去年冬天，社会秩序已第一次安谧起来；彝胞们快乐地度过了新年。当地彝、汉人民都说：“人民政府来了还不到一年，我们就过到好日子，我们感激毛主席，我们感谢共产党！”
    上述成绩的获得，在于西昌地区各级人民政府和人民解放军正确地执行了共同纲领中的民族政策；进入彝族地区的人民解放军指战员，严格地执行了三大纪律、八项注意，真正做到了尊重彝民的风俗习惯。像进军大凉山剿匪的我军某队，不住彝民房屋，经常在荒野中宿营；即令在沿途吃不上饭时，对彝民种的洋芋和萝卜也从不取食。这种优良的群众纪律，大大地感动了彝族人民。
    西昌军事管制委员会根据西昌地区各县的具体情况，分清轻重缓急，有步骤地开展各项工作。从越嶲到云南边境，沿着乐（山）西（昌）及西（昌）祥（云）公路，一条狭长的走廊，是汉人聚居或彝、汉杂居的地区。这一地区解放初期，国民党反动政权虽已被摧毁，但汉人地主和恶霸仍然高踞彝、汉人民头上，造谣作恶，或暗中组织叛乱。因此，在汉人地区清剿土匪特务，反对恶霸，开展减租成为不可或缓的工作。只有打垮这些反动势力，汉、彝人民才能翻身。
    在开展减租、反恶霸过程中，彝、汉人民认识了封建地主和大恶霸压迫彝、汉人民并进行挑拨离间的罪恶。西昌、越嶲等地的农民控诉汉人地主恶霸的大会上，附近的彝民均踊跃参加。越嶲中所坝万余人的群众大会上，彝、汉人民一致要求枪决作恶多端的廖春波。西昌、会理、冕宁、越嶲、盐源、盐边各县坚决镇压了土匪特务头子张为英、苏海澄、诸葛世槐等；各县人民均认识了过去彝、汉不团结，就是这群家伙勾结蒋介石匪帮所造成的。
    八个月来，西昌地区各县先后召开了彝、汉人民座谈会及群众大会，宣传了民族政策，订出团结公约，规定禁止打冤家，掳汉人，抢娃子等行为；昭觉成立了由彝民各支头组成的调解委员会，调解彝族内部的纠纷。
    派赴西康省大凉山、普格、普雄等地的工作人员，尽一切努力劝导彝胞内部团结；调解冤家纠纷时，不受任何报酬。
    去年年底，西昌军事管制委员会召集了全西昌地区的彝、汉、回、藏、黎、苏各族各界人民代表会议。牛牛坝、普雄、普格等地许多黑彝支头代表均被邀请出席。代表们受到军事管制委员会的热烈招待和各界人民的尊敬。会议开幕时，彝族妇女代表伊木妞妞接受了献花，她被感动得哭了起来。在旧社会里，他们被踏在脚底下，抬不起头来；今天，他们成了新社会的主人，他们切身体会到少数民族真正得到了自由和平等。
    西康省人民政府及西昌地区各级人民政府均有彝民干部参加工作。像西康省人民政府果基木古，西昌县人民政府副县长罗大英，冕宁县副县长瓦渣木基等都是彝民。
    西昌并设有少数民族干部训练班，专门培养彝、回等民族干部。彝民普遍的反应是：人民政府说了就做，咱们彝人今天真的见了青天。来自金沙江边的苗民王友富在昭觉彝、汉、苗族代表座谈会上说：“我们少数民族过去像关在黑屋子里一样，毛主席给我们开了大门，我们见了太阳，见了美丽的花草和树木。我们要加强团结，建设我们伟大的祖国。”
