Tianjin Military Control Commission Executes Criminal Wu Cunzhu
Tianjin Daily Calls on Factories and Enterprises to Heighten Vigilance and Strengthen Economic Security Work

The Military Tribunal of the Tianjin Military Control Commission, based on the public prosecution initiated by the Tianjin People's Procuratorate, organized a military court at 1:00 PM on the 13th of this month to publicly try the counter-revolutionary criminal Wu Cunzhu, who murdered the director and workers of the 60th Cigarette Factory of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin. More than 2,400 people attended the hearing, including representatives from the Tianjin garrison, all employees of the 60th Cigarette Factory, and representatives from some factories and enterprises in the city. According to Articles 9, Section 4 and Article 20 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the military court sentenced the criminal to death and immediately executed him by shooting.

The criminal Wu Cunzhu was a notorious landlord tyrant in Qingdian Village, Ji County, Hebei Province, known locally as "Wu Bantian." After the land reform in the spring of 1948, the People's Government left him some land, ordering him to engage in labor production to maintain his livelihood; but Wu's thinking was reactionary, and instead of accepting labor reform, he hated the People's Government and engaged in sabotage. In October 1949, when the local People's Government was about to place him under control, Wu fled to Tianjin upon hearing the news, seeking "employment" from his cousin Zhang Shude. Zhang Shude was the director of the supply and transportation department of the Logistics Production Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin. His class stance was very ambiguous. Seeing Wu coming to Tianjin, he did not investigate or consult his superiors, but introduced him to work at the 60th Cigarette Factory directly under his leadership. After Wu arrived at the factory, he was consistently passive in his work and continuously engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, spreading rumors and inciting workers to oppose the factory. During the production competition, he deliberately did not dry the cigarettes properly, causing losses to the factory. In October of last year, he took the opportunity to knock down the chimney of the tobacco curing room, but fortunately it was discovered early, preventing a fire. The factory worker Sun Qingxi was very dissatisfied with him and had raised concerns with the factory director Zhao Guangbi. After Wu found out, he conceived the idea of assassination. On the night of October 17th last year, Wu held a sharp axe and attempted to murder Sun Qingxi. Because Sun was not yet asleep, Wu broke into the room of factory director Zhao Guangbi and injured the back of Zhao's head with the axe. This was discovered by Dong Shizhu, the gatekeeper of the factory, who shouted loudly. Wu hid in the women's toilet. When workers Wang Zhixin and others found him with guns, Wu injured Wang with the axe and snatched the gun. When the driver Yu Zhizhou bravely held Wu, Wu injured Yu with the axe and fled out of the factory, forcing a rickshaw worker Shang Guanghe at gunpoint to pull him to Yangcun. Seeing that the situation was not right, the rickshaw worker pulled to a police station, abandoned the rickshaw and went in to report. Wu got out of the car and fled, but was eventually arrested by our public security department on the way.

During the interrogation, Wu confessed to all of the above circumstances due to conclusive evidence.

During the public trial, the masses spoke out one after another, unanimously demanding that Wu be severely punished. All employees of the 60th Cigarette Factory jointly signed and stamped their request to sentence Wu to death.

After the Prosecutor read the indictment of the Tianjin People's Procuratorate, when the judge formally announced the death penalty for Wu, the participants cheered and enthusiastically supported it.

The landlord elements introduced by Zhang Shude, director of the supply and transportation department of the Logistics Production Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin, to various factories under the department were not limited to Wu Cunzhu alone. At that time, those who came to Tianjin with Wu also included Wu's son Wu Yuduo and his relatives Wang Huichen, Xia Jinling, and Meng Xuede, all of whom were targets of struggle during the land reform. Zhang Shude also introduced them to work at the 60th Cigarette Factory without authorization. Wang Huichen often spread rumors to confuse the public, carried out reactionary propaganda for American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang, and openly slandered the people's newspapers as "spreading rumors" (the criminal has been arrested by the public security organs and sentenced to imprisonment by the court). Xia Jinling often wasted materials in her work, causing great losses to the factory. In addition, in the oil factory and flour factory under the department, there were also those who were privately introduced by Zhang Shude, and their usual behavior was also suspicious (all have now been ordered to leave the factory). This shows Zhang Shude's serious ambiguity in his class stance and his serious irresponsibility to the people. The relevant parties have decided to give him due punishment.

In addition, the occurrence of the 60th Cigarette Factory incident also shows the bureaucratic style of the factory's administrative leadership and trade union, and the leaders of a certain unit stationed in Tianjin have also ordered them to conduct a profound review to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. (Yu)

The Tianjin Daily published a commentary on the case of the counter-revolutionary criminal Wu Cunzhu, and after explaining the People's Government's policy of labor reform for landlords, pointed out: If the landlord elements are unwilling to repent, but instead sabotage production, sabotage the revolution, and become enemies of the people, then they will embark on Wu Cunzhu's shameful path. The commentary then pointed out: This incident also shows that among our minority of cadres, there is a serious phenomenon of numbness and indifference, and a lack of vigilance against class enemies. Zhang Shude, the director of the supply and transportation department of the Logistics Production Department of a certain unit, neither investigated nor asked for instructions regarding some landlord elements whom he did not understand at all, and privately introduced and employed them. This behavior is a loss of position, and objectively helped the enemy's sabotage activities. The relevant parties have decided to give him punishment, which is completely necessary. The factory's leadership and trade union failed to discover this situation for a long time, resulting in this unnecessary loss, and should also conduct a profound review.

Finally, the commentary emphatically stated: Strengthening the security work of factories and enterprises must rely on the masses. The incident at the 60th Factory once again proves this important principle. In advance, the worker Sun Qingxi warned the leadership about Wu Cunzhu's reactionary behavior. If the factory leadership had been able to pay attention at that time and take appropriate measures, this loss could have been completely avoided. The lesson of the 60th Cigarette Factory is worth paying attention to by all factories and enterprises.

　　严惩混入工厂破坏生产谋杀职工的反革命地主
    天津市军事管制委员会处决罪犯吴存卓
    天津日报号召各工厂企业提高警惕加强经济保卫工作
    天津市军事管制委员会军法处根据天津市人民检察署提起的公诉，于本月十三日下午一时组织军事法庭，公审谋杀我人民解放军驻天津某部六○烟厂厂长及职工的反革命罪犯吴存卓。参加旁听者包括驻天津部队代表，六○烟厂全体职工及市内部分工厂、企业代表等两千四百余人。军法处根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例第九条第四款及第二十条的规定，当庭判处该犯死刑，并即执行枪决。
    吴犯存卓，系河北省蓟县青甸村的大恶霸地主，当地村民均称之为“吴半天”。一九四八年春土地改革后，人民政府给其留下部分土地，令其劳动生产，维持生活；但吴犯思想反动，不但不接受劳动改造，反而仇视人民政府，进行捣乱破坏。一九四九年十月间，当该地人民政府要对他加以管制时，吴犯即闻风潜逃天津，找其表兄张树德“谋求职业”。张树德是驻天津解放军某部后勤生产部的供运处长，阶级立场甚为模糊，见吴来天津，未经调查，亦不请示上级，自行将其介绍到他直接领导的六○烟厂做工。吴到厂后工作一贯消极，并不断进行反革命活动，散布谣言，鼓动职工与厂方对立。在生产竞赛中，他故意不把卷烟烤干，使厂方受到损失。去年十月间，并乘隙把烤烟烟囱弄倒，幸被发觉较早，没有酿成火灾。该厂职工孙庆喜对其颇为不满，曾向厂长赵光璧提出意见。吴犯获悉后，即萌暗杀之念。在去年十月十七日夜，吴犯竟手持利斧，图谋杀害孙庆喜。因孙当时尚未睡熟，吴遂闯到厂长赵光璧屋内，用斧将赵后脑砍伤，此事当为厂内看门的董世柱发觉，大声呼喊，吴藏到女厕所内，等职工王志新等持枪寻到时，吴又以斧头将王砍伤，并将枪支夺去。司机于志洲奋勇将吴抱住时，吴又将于砍伤后逃出厂外，以枪逼迫三轮工人尚广和将其拉到杨村，该三轮工人见势不对，拉至某派出所时，弃车进去报告，吴即下车潜逃，但终为我公安部门在中途缉获归案。
    对于上述情况，审讯中由于证据确凿，吴犯均已供认不讳。
    公审中，群众纷纷发言，一致要求对吴犯予以严厉惩处。六○烟厂全体职工并联名盖章要求将吴犯判处死刑。
    检察长宣读了天津市人民检察署的起诉书以后，审判员正式宣判处吴犯以极刑时，与会群众一致欢呼，热烈拥护。
    经驻天津解放军某部后勤生产部供运处长张树德介绍到该部所属各厂的地主分子，并不止于吴犯存卓一人。当时，随吴来天津者尚有吴的儿子吴玉铎及其亲属王惠臣、夏金玲、孟学德等多人，均系土地改革中被斗争的对象，一并为张树德介绍到六○烟厂做工。王惠臣平素经常造谣惑众，为美帝国主义及国民党匪帮进行反动宣传，并公开诬蔑人民报纸“造谣”（该犯已经公安机关逮捕，由法院判处徒刑）。夏金玲工作中时常浪费材料，使工厂损失很大。此外，在该部所属之油厂、面粉厂中，亦有经张树德私自介绍者，平素行为亦多值得怀疑（现均已被勒令离厂）。由此可见张树德阶级立场的严重模糊，及对人民不负责任的严重程度。有关方面，已决予应有的处分。
    此外，六○烟厂事件的发生，亦表现了该厂行政领导及工会方面平素的官僚主义作风，驻天津某部领导上亦决令其进行深刻检讨，以保证不再发生类似事件。（于）
    天津日报对吴存卓反革命罪犯案发表了评论，并在解释人民政府对待地主的劳动改造政策后指出：地主分子倘不肯悔悟，反而破坏生产，破坏革命，与人民为敌，那么他就要走上吴存卓的可耻的道路。评论接着指出：这一事件也说明在我们少数干部中间，存在着严重的麻木不仁的现象，对阶级敌人缺乏警惕。某部后勤生产部供运处长张树德对于一些自己毫不了解的地主分子，既不调查，又不请示，私自介绍录用。这种行为，是丧失立场的行为，在客观上帮助了敌人的破坏活动。有关方面已决定予以处分，这是完全必要的。该厂领导及工会对此情况长期不能发觉，以致造成此不必要的损失，亦应进行深刻检讨。
    最后，评论着重提出：加强工厂企业保卫工作必须依靠群众，六○工厂这一事件再次证明了这个重要的道理。在事先，工人孙庆喜即将吴存卓的反动行为向领导方面提出警告，如果该厂领导当时能够重视，并采取适当措施，这一损失是完全可以避免的。六○烟厂这次教训，是值得各个工厂企业都加以重视的。
