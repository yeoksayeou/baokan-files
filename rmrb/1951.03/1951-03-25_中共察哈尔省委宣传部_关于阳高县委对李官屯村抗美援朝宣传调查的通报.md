Editor's Note: In order to help leading organs in various regions acquire a method for conducting typical investigations to discover problems and promote the advancement of anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work, and to learn from the good experiences of anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda in rural southern Chahar, we are publishing the "通报 on the Yanggao County Committee’s Investigation of Anti-American and Aid-Korea Propaganda in Liguan Village" sent to us by the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee Propaganda Department. This 通报 was issued on February 25th. We have made some deletions in its publication.

We are now forwarding the investigation findings of the Yanggao County Committee on anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda in Liguan Village in summary for reference by party committees at all levels. The anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda in Liguan Village has been successful; however, the investigation shows that even in these villages considered to have better propaganda work, the propaganda is still not thorough. Therefore, it is still necessary to carry out propaganda work in depth, and the leadership should constantly raise new issues, centering on anti-Americanism and patriotism, and conduct propaganda from all aspects, such as the current opposition to the rearmament of Japan by the United States, the suppression of the activities of American imperialism and the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit groups in our mainland—special agents and bandits, the banning of Yiguandao, and support for the Chinese People's Volunteers, etc.

This material also shows that winter schools are good places to carry out patriotic ideological education in rural areas. The masses who attend people's schools in Liguan Village know much more than those who do not. Various localities can combine this with the recent central work to check the people's schools, solve the problems that exist, and mobilize as many people as possible to enroll.

We suggest that each county party committee investigate one to several villages regarding anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, and based on the investigation results, raise questions and formulate specific measures for continuing to carry out and regularly uphold patriotic propaganda.

Yanggao Liguan Village Anti-American and Aid-Korea Propaganda Investigation

In early January, the Yanggao County Committee sent people to Liguan Village, District Nine, to conduct a preliminary investigation of the village's anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda. This village is located close to the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, three miles from the county seat, with a total of 338 households and a population of 1,631. The party branch is a first-class branch, with 46 party members, 74 Communist Youth League members, two labor models, 27 representatives to the county, district, and village people's representative conferences, two primary school teachers, and eight backbone militia members. Upon arriving in the village, the county committee comrades first conducted interviews with cadres and party members, then visited five families with varying degrees of understanding of anti-American and aid-Korea, including men, women, old, and young. They also casually asked 17 young men, 3 young women, 13 primary school students, 3 old men, and 4 middle-aged women who were attending winter school and at a tofu shop on the street. The results of the investigation:

1.  Anti-American and Aid-Korea Propaganda Situation: District Committee Comrade Jing Wanming, in the village's autumn grain collection, mobilization of party members for training, arrangement of winter production, party consolidation, and strengthening of national defense construction, explained the current situation at party branch meetings and convened four mass meetings for propaganda, each attended by 200 to 300 people.

Secondly, are the village's party member cadres, who were trained in party member training classes, or participated in the county's enlarged cadre meetings and representative conferences, and heard reports on anti-American and aid-Korea, and had a general understanding of the principles of anti-American and aid-Korea and defending the country. When they returned to the village, they told the masses, such as village chief Chen Qi, village democratic women's federation cadre Wang Ailian, etc., all spoke to everyone at village cadre meetings, representative conferences, and women's member meetings about what they had heard. Party branch secretary Hao Jinbi cooperated with primary school students in costume propaganda and propagated to the masses three times.

Then there are the various activities of primary school teachers: one is reading the newspaper, with teachers explaining the newspaper to cadres or the masses, but the audience is not very wide; another is the blackboard newspaper: it can be updated every five to seven days, but because the language of the blackboard newspaper is not colloquial, its role is not very significant; third, leading students to perform small street plays and rhyming stories, etc., a total of six times. Another method of leading students in propaganda is to teach students a few simple sentences, such as "America is our enemy, Korea is our friend, anti-American and aid-Korea is for everyone to live a peaceful life," and let them pass it on to their families. Fourth, giving political lessons in winter school and combining them with literacy classes, which is the most effective method. The village's winter school has 65 male and 35 female students, and the students have a higher level of understanding. Thirty students learned the four characters "抗美援朝" (Anti-American and Aid-Korea). A shortcoming of winter political classes is that there is less explanation and more recitation (teachers' level is low), which needs to be improved.

2.  Masses' Level of Understanding and Gains: The masses' level of understanding: 43 out of 46 party members know that Korea is our gateway, the Korean people are one family with us, America is our enemy, and Truman is a big bad guy. They understand the simple principles of anti-American and aid-Korea. Three do not know what "anti-American and aid-Korea" is about, but they also know that America is our enemy and the Soviet Union is our friend. The 100 people attending winter school generally know that America is our mortal enemy, Korea is our friend, and anti-American and aid-Korea is to protect our good life. When asked how to resist America and aid Korea, most replied: do a good job in production, and keep the landlords, Yiguandao, and stubborn puppet personnel under control. Some people also know that Truman is a "gray devil". When elementary school students perform street plays, some people want to "see what Truman looks like". However, some elderly people and some women who do not attend winter school still do not know about this, and are ignorant when asked, and still have some confused ideas.

Due to the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, the various winter work tasks were successfully completed on schedule. In addition, a major gain is that the thought of fearing "change of regime" has been largely eliminated. In addition, during the New Year, more than 100 farmers donated more than 2.8 million yuan to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the volunteers, and also made some consolation bags. When asked four women who made consolation bags, they all said they were for the "People's Volunteers."

However, this propaganda is obviously very insufficient, so we must continue to use various methods and seize various opportunities to carry out propaganda in the future.

　　中共察哈尔省委宣传部
    关于阳高县委对李官屯村抗美援朝宣传调查的通报
    编者按：为了帮助各地领导机关取得一个进行典型调查，以便发现问题推动抗美援朝宣传工作前进的方法，并学习察南农村抗美援朝宣传的好的经验起见，下面我们发表了中共察哈尔省委宣传部寄给我们的《关于阳高县委对李官屯抗美援朝宣传调查的通报》。这个通报是二月二十五日发出的。在发表时，我们作了一些删节。
    现在把阳高县委对李官屯村抗美援朝宣传的调查情况，摘要转发各级党委参考。李官屯抗美援朝宣传是有成绩的；但从调查中说明：即使是这些认为宣传工作较好的村子，其宣传仍然是不深入的。因此，就仍需要深入开展宣传工作，领导上要不断地提出新的问题来，围绕着反美爱国，从各方面进行宣传，如目前的反对美国重新武装日本，镇压美帝国主义及蒋匪残余集团在我们内地的爪牙——特务土匪的活动，取缔一贯道，以及拥护中国人民志愿军等等。
    这个材料，也说明冬学是农村开展爱国主义思想教育的良好的场所。李官屯村上民校的群众，比不上的知道的事情多的多。各地可结合最近中心工作把民校检查一下，解决其存在的问题，动员尽可能多的群众入学。
    我们建议每个县委调查一至数村的抗美援朝的宣传，并根据调查结果提出问题，订出继续开展和经常坚持爱国主义宣传的具体措施。
    阳高李官屯抗美援朝宣传调查
    一月初，阳高县委派人到九区李官屯，对该村抗美援朝宣传作了一次初步的调查，这村紧靠京绥铁路，距县城三里地，全村三三八户，人口一六三一名。党支部是第一类支部。有党员四十六名，青年团员七十四名，劳动模范二人，县区村人民代表会代表共二十七人，小学教员二人，骨干民兵八名。县委同志到村即首先从干部、党员中进行了解，接着访问了对抗美援朝认识较好与较差的群众五家，包括男女老少，又在街上豆腐房里用闲扯的办法随便问了上冬学的青年男一七人，女三人，小学生一三人，老汉三人，壮年妇女四人，调查的结果：
    一、抗美援朝宣传的情况：区委景万明同志在该村秋征、动员党员受训、布置冬季生产、整党、加强国防建设等工作中，除在党支部会上讲解了时事以外，召开了四次群众会进行宣传，每次会有二百至三百人参加。
    其次，是村里党员干部，他们在党员训练班受了训，或参加了县扩大干部会、代表会，听了抗美援朝的报告，笼统地知道了些抗美援朝、保家卫国的道理。他们回到村便讲给了群众，如村长陈启、村民主妇女联合会干部王爱莲等都在村干部会上、代表会上、妇女会员会上，把自己听来的东西讲给大家。党支部书记郝进壁配合小学学生化装宣传，向群众宣传过三次。
    再就是小学教员的各种活动：一种是读报，由教员给干部或群众讲报，但听讲的人不很广泛；再一种是黑板报：能作到每五天至七天改换一次内容，但因黑板报文字不通俗，作用也不很大；第三、领导学生演出小型街头剧、说快板等，共进行六次。领导学生宣传的另一种方法，是教给学生几句简单的话，如“美国是咱们的敌人，朝鲜是咱的朋友，抗美援朝是为了大家过太平日子”，让他们传给家里的人。第四、在冬学里讲政治课，并结合识字课，这是起作用最大的一种方法，该村冬学有学员男六五名，女三五名，学员的认识较高，并有三○个学员学会了“抗美援朝”四个生字。冬季政治课的一个缺点是讲的少念的多（教员程度低），须要加以改善。
    二、群众的了解的程度和收获：群众了解的程度：四十六个党员中有四十三个知道朝鲜是咱们的大门，朝鲜人民和我们是一家子人，美国是咱们的敌人，杜鲁门是大坏蛋。懂得简单的抗美援朝的道理。有三个不知道“抗美援朝”是怎回事，但也知道美国是咱们的敌人，苏联是咱们的朋友。上冬学的一百人，一般知道美国是咱的死对头，朝鲜是咱们的朋友，抗美援朝是为了保卫自己的好光景。问如何抗美援朝，大部分答道：搞好生产，把地主、一贯道、顽伪人员管住。有些群众也知道了杜鲁门是个“灰鬼”。小学生演街头剧时，有些群众要“看看杜鲁门是个啥样的”。但是一些年老的人和一部分不上冬学的妇女还不知道这回事，一问三不知，并且还有一些糊涂认识。
    由于进行了抗美援朝的宣传，使各项冬季工作任务顺利地按期完成了。此外，一个大收获是相当地消除了怕“变天”的思想。此外在年节时，有百余户农民捐款二百八十多万元，慰劳革命烈士和军人的家属和志愿军，还作了些慰问袋。问了四个作慰问袋的妇女，都说是给“人民志愿军的”。
    但这种宣传显然是很不够的，因此，今后须继续采用各种方法，抓紧各种时机进行宣传。
