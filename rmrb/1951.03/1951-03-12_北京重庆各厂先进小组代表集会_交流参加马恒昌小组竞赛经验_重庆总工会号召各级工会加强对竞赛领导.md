　　Beijing and Chongqing Factories Hold Advanced Team Meeting
    Exchanging Experiences in Participating in the Ma Hengchang Team Competition
    Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions Calls on Trade Unions at All Levels to Strengthen Leadership of the Competition
    On the 4th of this month, the Beijing Workers' Daily invited the leaders of twenty-two advanced teams from factories in the capital to hold a forum to exchange work experiences after their teams responded to the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Team. Currently, more than 700 teams in factories and mines throughout Beijing have responded to the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Team, and the above twenty-two teams are among the better performing ones. Seven advanced team leaders presented reports at the forum. These reports illustrated from various perspectives how they learned from the advanced experience and new work attitude of the Ma Hengchang Team. Some teams, after accepting the challenge, greatly improved production because they carried out criticism and self-criticism, and the teams were very united and helped each other. For example, in the Jiao Yaozong Mutual Aid Team of the Beijing Trolleybus Repair Factory, the team was very disunited in the past. When defective work appeared, no one dared to ask anyone, and if they did, the response was, "Is it any of your business?" After accepting the challenge, the administration and the trade union spoke individually with several particularly disunited people and also held a review meeting. After mutual review and criticism, everyone has gradually become united. Those with good skills can help those with poor skills. In the past month, standard products have accounted for more than 90 percent, and not a single defective product has been produced. Many teams have improved everyone's technical level by uniting technical personnel and veteran workers. In the Liu Dezhen Team of the Turbine Section of the Shijingshan Power Plant, workers learned the formula calculation methods used by technical personnel, creating a record of finding the turbine's center of gravity in two days. Last year, workers relied on experience and guesswork, which took five days. Zhang Fengquan Team of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory has a veteran worker named Xu Shuzhang. He has a long work history and good skills, but because he is a little proud, he is not very united with many people. When the team was preparing to accept the challenge, he was afraid of being tired and did not dare to accept it. The team leader tried to help him, solicited his opinions on everything, and assigned apprentices to him. If he still felt too busy, everyone helped him with the work. This moved him greatly, and he also became active. After accepting the challenge, he took the lead in researching a new operation method that only moves the tools and not the work, which immediately increased output by one-fold, and the quality also met the specifications.
    In addition to the team leaders, representatives from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China were also invited to participate in the forum.

    From March 4th to 6th, the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions convened a city-wide representative meeting of teams responding to the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Team to exchange work experiences of various responding teams and discuss strengthening the leadership of trade unions at all levels in the response competition. Within a month, the production units in the city that responded to the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Team quickly expanded to 21 factories with 220 teams. Some of these teams have improved production by initially achieving the conditions for accepting the challenge, but the challenge conditions of many teams are relatively general, so the production results are not very significant. The meeting first featured typical reports from representatives of teams with better competition results. The representative of the Zhang Shaoru Team of a certain machinery factory, which had already achieved challenge conditions such as increasing output by 10 percent and reducing defective products to 0.05 percent, reported that the important key to the team's success was that all team members had repeatedly studied the patriotic working spirit and advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Team in advance, and earnestly achieved unity, mutual assistance, and open technology. The responding team of the private Shashi Cotton Mill, while carrying out the production competition, strengthened the work of strictly preventing special agents and fire prevention, and cracked a major special agent case that plotted to sabotage the factory's machinery at the end of February. After the representative of the factory's security department reported the incident at the meeting, all units in the midst of intense response raised their vigilance. According to the spirit of the meeting, the team representatives prepared to return to the factory to continue to study the experience of the Ma Hengchang Team and current affairs in depth, and actively strengthen the security work to prevent sabotage by special agents. Some teams with relatively general challenge conditions are also preparing to re-discuss and formulate practical and feasible conditions in light of specific circumstances. At the meeting, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions requested that in the future, the leading organs of trade unions at all levels must focus on cultivating typical responding teams, regularly check the implementation of the conditions of each responding unit, and exchange and summarize the experiences of various factories.

### 北京重庆各厂先进小组代表集会  交流参加马恒昌小组竞赛经验  重庆总工会号召各级工会加强对竞赛领导

　　北京重庆各厂先进小组代表集会
    交流参加马恒昌小组竞赛经验 
    重庆总工会号召各级工会加强对竞赛领导
    北京工人日报社在本月四日邀请首都各工厂二十二个先进小组组长举行座谈会，交流各组向马恒昌小组应战后的工作经验。目前北京全市厂矿中已有七百多个小组向马恒昌小组应战，上面二十二个小组是其中成绩较好的一部分。有七个先进小组长在座谈会中作了报告。这些报告从各个角度说明他们如何学习马恒昌小组的先进经验和新的劳动态度。有些小组应战后因为开展了批评和自我批评，小组团结互助得很好，生产大有改进。如北京电车修造厂职工班焦耀宗互助小组，过去组内很不团结，出了废活，谁都不敢问谁，一问就是“管得着吗？”应战后行政和工会找几个特别不团结的人个别谈话，另外又开了检讨会。经过相互检讨、批评，现在，大家日渐团结了，技术好的能帮助技术差点的，一个月来，作出的标准品占百分之九十以上，没有出一件废品。不少小组因为团结了技术人员和老工人，提高了大家的技术水平。石景山发电厂汽机班刘德珍小组，因为工人们学会了技术人员用公式计算的方法，创造了两天找到汽机重心的纪录。去年工人们凭经验摸，结果需要五天时间。华北农业机械厂张凤泉小组有一个老工人徐树章，他工龄长、技术好，就是因为有点骄傲，和很多人不太团结。小组准备应战时，他怕累，不敢应战。小组长就想办法去帮助他，事事征求他的意见，又把徒弟拨给他，如果他还嫌忙，大家去帮他干活。这使他很感动，结果也积极起来了。应战后他带头研究出了只动工具不动活的新操作方法，一下提高产量一倍，质量也合乎规格。

    重庆市总工会于三月四日至六日召开全市向马恒昌小组应战小组的代表会议，交流各应战小组工作经验，并讨论加强各级工会对应战竞赛的领导等问题。全市向马恒昌小组应战的生产单位，在一个月中已迅速扩展到二十一个厂二百二十个小组。其中部分小组已因初步实现应战条件，改进了生产；但不少小组的应战条件比较笼统，因而生产成绩不很显著。会议首先由应战竞赛较好的小组代表作了典型报告。已经实现产量提高百分之十、废品降到千分之零点五等应战条件的某机械厂张少如小组的代表，报告该组获得成绩的重要关键，是全体组员事先曾反复研究了马恒昌小组爱国主义的工作精神和先进经验，认真做到了团结互助和公开技术。私营沙市纱厂的应战小组在开展生产竞赛同时，由于加强严防特务及防火等工作，在二月底破获了阴谋破坏该厂机器的重大特务案。该厂保全部代表在会上报告这一事件经过后，使在紧张应战中的各单位提高了警惕。根据会议精神，各小组代表准备回厂后，继续深入进行对马恒昌小组经验和时事的学习，并积极加强防止特务破坏的保卫工作。有些应战条件订得比较笼统的小组，并准备重新讨论，结合具体情况，订出切实可行的条件。会上，市总工会负责同志要求今后各级工会领导机关必须有重点地培养典型应战小组，定期检查各应战单位的条件执行情形，交流并总结各厂经验。
