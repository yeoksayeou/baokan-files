Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 6th: The people of Guangzhou recently revealed a shocking crime committed by an imperialist "charity" organization in China. The "Holy Infant Orphanage," run by Canadian nuns in the city, has seen the deaths of 2,116 infants from the time of liberation to the present, a mortality rate reaching 94% of the infants admitted. This incident has aroused great anger among the people of the city, who are demanding a thorough investigation by the government and appropriate action.

The "Holy Infant Orphanage" is located at 47 Taojin坑, Shahe District, Guangzhou, and is run by the Canadian "Immaculate Conception Sisters" under the guise of rescuing impoverished, helpless, or abandoned infants. The orphanage is managed by Director Pan Ya Fang, Deputy Director Gao Zhongchen, and nuns Lian Wangde, Tang Yaqin, and Lü Xinde, all five of whom are Canadian. They adopt an extremely cruel and extremely reckless attitude towards the lives of Chinese infants. The entire orphanage has only two Chinese assistant workers, who are elderly orphans from the orphanage. In addition, there are eight orphans aged thirteen or fourteen and two old women in their fifties who do chores such as washing clothes, looking after babies, and growing vegetables. Two of these eight thirteen- or fourteen-year-old orphans are blind, two are physically disabled, and one is mute; one of the two old women is also blind. Currently, the orphanage has thirty-four orphans aged five to eighteen, thirty-three aged two to five, and more than sixty under the age of one. Orphans in the orphanage do not have the freedom to leave until they are twenty-one years old. During these long years, their labor is exploited, and their precious youth is devastated. The places where the babies live are filled with turbid air and are extremely filthy; the bedding consists only of old, tattered army blankets; some places are often locked with iron gates. The food the babies eat is often rotten and smelly. The heads of the orphanage, Pan Ya Fang and others, never pay attention to the infants' illnesses. There is no medical equipment in the orphanage. Deputy Director Gao Zhongchen only studied nursing for two or three years in Canada; however, she actually serves as the orphanage's doctor, diagnosing and treating sick infants. When diagnosing illnesses, she neither writes medical records nor prescriptions, diagnosing and prescribing medicine haphazardly. This is one of the direct causes of the high mortality rate. They also turn a blind eye to the large number of infant deaths. Therefore, although more than 2,000 infants have died in the orphanage since liberation, Pan Ya Fang and others have never taken any measures to improve the orphanage's operations.

When the inhumane situation in the orphanage was exposed, reporters who visited the orphanage saw that the remaining hundred or so infants were all pale and emaciated; moreover, seven or eight out of ten of these infants were ill, and two infants had already died. The old woman in charge of caring for the infants, fearing being seen by the visitors, hurriedly placed the dead infant on the bed and lowered the mosquito net, attempting to conceal it. When reporters asked about the condition of the infant on the bed, she stammered, "This one is seriously ill." But when the reporter opened the mosquito net, it turned out to be a dead infant! At this point, she changed her tune and said, "Just died." The older orphans who care for the infants are all haggard, shabbily dressed, and walk barefoot on the cold cement floor. When they see people, their eyes are dim, and they dare not say anything. Conversely, the Canadian nuns are all full of energy and have rosy complexions; their living rooms and reception rooms are decorated very luxuriously, with pianos, dressing tables, and carpets, everything one could wish for.

The exposure of this incident has further enlightened the people of Guangzhou as to what these so-called aid organizations run by the imperialists in China are really like.

　　帝国主义“慈善事业”在我国造下滔天罪行！
    广州加拿大“圣婴婴院”残害我国儿童
    从解放到目前死亡婴孩达二千余，激起全市人民愤怒，要求政府调查处理。
    【新华社广州六日电】广州市人民最近揭露了一件帝国主义“慈善事业”机关在中国所犯的骇人听闻的罪行。该市一所由加拿大修女所主持的“圣婴婴院”，从解放后到目前，死亡婴孩二千一百一十六名，死亡率竟达所收婴孩的百分之九十四。这一事件已引起了全市人民极大的愤怒，纷纷要求政府进行彻底的调查并作适当的处理。
    “圣婴婴院”设在广州市沙河区陶金坑四十七号，是加拿大“无原罪修女会”假救济贫苦无靠者或被弃的婴儿之名所举办。该院由院长潘雅方、副院长高忠臣及修道女连望德、唐雅琴、吕信德等五人负责。她们都是加拿大人。她们对中国婴儿的生命，采取了极端残忍和极端轻率的态度。全院只有两个中国籍的助理员，是该院年长的孤女。另外还有八个十三、四岁的孤女和两个五十岁的老妇人，她们在院内作洗衣服、看婴孩及种菜等杂务。这八个十三、四岁的孤女中有两个是瞎子，两个手足残废，一个是哑巴；两个老妇人中也有一个是瞎子。现该院有五岁至十八岁的孤儿三十四人，二岁至五岁的三十三人，周岁以下的六十余人。在院孤儿要到二十一岁才有出院的自由。他们在这样的漫长岁月里被剥削劳动力，更被摧残了宝贵的青春。婴儿们住的地方都是空气混浊，污秽不堪；床上的设备只有破旧的军毡；有些地方还经常用铁闸关锁起来。婴儿吃的也常常是腐烂发臭的食品。该院负责人潘雅方等对婴儿疾病从未加以注意。院中毫无医疗设备。副院长高忠臣在加拿大仅学过两三年看护；但她实际上竟充任院中医生，诊治病婴。她在诊病时，既不写病历证，又不写处方笺，乱诊断，乱用药。这是直接造成严重死亡率的原因之一。对婴儿的大批死亡，她们也视若无睹。所以虽然解放后该院死亡了二千多名婴孩，潘雅方等始终未作改进院务的任何措施。
    当该院这种惨无人道的情况被揭发后，记者们去参观该院时，看见残留着的一百多个婴儿，个个脸色苍白，骨瘦如柴；而且这些婴儿十之七、八都在病中，有两个婴儿已经死了。看管婴儿的老妇人因怕被参观者看到，匆匆忙忙地把死婴放在床上，并落下蚊帐，企图遮掩，记者问及床上婴儿情况时，她支支吾吾地说：“这是患重病的。”但记者打开蚊帐一看，原来是死婴！这时她才改口说：“刚死的。”看管婴孩的大孤儿都是容颜憔悴，衣衫褴褛，赤着脚在冰冷的水门汀地上行走。她们见了人时目光黯淡，什么都不敢说。相反的，那些加拿大的修女们则个个精神饱满，面色红润；她们的住室和会客室都布置得十分华丽，钢琴、梳妆台、地毡、应有尽有。
    这一事件的揭露，使广州市人民更进一步地认识了帝国主义者在中国所办的救济机构究竟是怎样一回事。
