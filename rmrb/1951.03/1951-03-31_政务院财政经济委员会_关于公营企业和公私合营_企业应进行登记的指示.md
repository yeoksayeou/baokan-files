　　Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee
    Instructions Regarding the Registration of Public Enterprises and Joint Public-Private Enterprises

    The Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises and its Implementation Measures have been promulgated and implemented successively. The separate methods for industrial and commercial registration promulgated by various regions should be abolished immediately. Public enterprises and joint public-private enterprises, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations, should also refer to the aforementioned regulations and measures to register with the competent industrial and commercial administrative authorities of each city and county. If the public and joint public-private enterprises are organized as companies, or are directly led by various central ministries, they should be reported to this committee for registration through the local city and county competent industrial and commercial administrative authorities.

    It is hoped that the above will be passed on for compliance.
                              Director Chen Yun
                          March 30, 1951
    (The implementation measures of the Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises will be published on page 2 of tomorrow's newspaper - Editor)

　　政务院财政经济委员会
    关于公营企业和公私合营   
    企业应进行登记的指示
    私营企业暂行条例及其施行办法，已先后公布施行，各地区所颁布的工商业登记单行办法，应即废止。公营企业和公私合营企业，除另有法令规定者外，亦应参照上述条例及办法，向各市县主管工商行政机关办理登记，其公营及公私合营企业而为公司组织，或由中央各部直接领导者，则应经由当地市县主管工商行政机关转报本委办理登记。
    以上希转知遵行。
                              主任  陈云
                          一九五一年三月三十日
