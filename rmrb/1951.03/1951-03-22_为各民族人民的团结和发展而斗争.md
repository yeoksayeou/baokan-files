　　The several decisions on ethnic affairs promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on February 5 were formulated based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a deep understanding of the needs of various ethnic minorities. It indicates the path that should be followed in developing the political, economic, and cultural construction of various ethnic minority areas, with the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and the training of ethnic minority cadres as the central tasks at present. This is a move that fully conforms to the interests of all ethnic groups. Its implementation will surely greatly advance the cause of unity and development of all ethnic groups in our country.

　　The founding of the People's Republic of China has fundamentally changed the relationship between all ethnic groups, transforming it from animosity and estrangement to equality, friendship, and mutual assistance, laying an unbreakable foundation for the unity and development of all ethnic groups in our country. In the past year or so, people's governments at all levels and the People's Liberation Army have done a great deal of work to increase ethnic friendship and unity, based on the spirit of the Common Program, and have achieved great results. The number of ethnic disputes that have been satisfactorily resolved alone amounts to thousands. At the same time, the Central People's Government's dispatch of two visiting groups to the Northwest and Southwest to visit various ethnic minority areas, especially the participation of representatives of various ethnic minorities in the National Day celebration in Beijing, has enabled the Central Government to further understand the situation and demands of various ethnic minorities, and has enabled various ethnic minorities to have a deeper understanding of the Central Government's ethnic policies. This has consolidated and developed the foundation for ethnic unity and cooperation. However, the remaining phenomena of animosity, estrangement, discrimination, and mistrust among the people of all ethnic groups cannot be completely eliminated due to their long historical origins; and the imperialist aggressive forces and hidden counter-revolutionaries are using this gap to continue to sow discord. Therefore, the unity among the people of all ethnic groups and within various ethnic minorities must be strengthened.

　　The primary condition for further strengthening ethnic unity and development is that all ethnic groups, under the basic spirit of the Common Program and the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, manage their own affairs according to the will of the majority of their people and through the forms they are willing to adopt. That is, to implement regional autonomy in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, to establish autonomous organs through people's representative conferences, and in areas where ethnic groups live in mixed communities, to establish ethnic democratic coalition governments through people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups. Ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic coalition governments are the most appropriate and reasonable policies for solving ethnic problems and realizing ethnic equality politically within the People's Republic of China today. For a long time, various ethnic minorities have been excluded from political power, deprived of the right to participate in government, and enslaved by the reactionary rulers of the Han or other majority ethnic groups. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, on the one hand, it prohibited the continuation of any ethnic oppression system, and on the other hand, it guided people's governments at all levels to implement the ethnic policies of the Common Program. In the past year or so, local people's governments have implemented regional autonomy in some ethnic minority areas and ethnic democratic coalition governments in some ethnic mixed areas. Experience has proved that in these areas, the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups has been appropriately developed, bandits have been eliminated, "no more fighting wrongdoers," so that social order is becoming more stable, production has begun to recover and develop, a fiscal and tax system has begun to be established, and other tasks have also been carried out smoothly.

　　Ethnic forms and new democratic content have begun to combine, thus unfolding a bright future for various ethnic minorities. However, there are also some Han cadres in some areas who, due to insufficient understanding of ethnic policies and lack of experience, are still afraid to earnestly implement the policies and systems of regional autonomy and ethnic democratic coalition governments; this is undoubtedly wrong. Therefore, the State Council of the Central People's Government requires in its decision that the military and political committees (people's governments) of major administrative regions guide the relevant provincial, municipal, and administrative office people's governments to earnestly implement the policies and systems of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic coalition governments. We believe that after the promulgation of this decision, there will definitely be more ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic democratic coalition governments appearing in the great family of all ethnic groups in our great motherland. In addition, there are also some people in ethnic minorities who demand the implementation of regional autonomy and ethnic democratic coalition governments without preparation or steps. This is because they do not yet understand that whether it is the establishment of ethnic regional autonomy or ethnic democratic coalition governments, necessary political and organizational preparations must be carried out among the people of all strata of the relevant ethnic groups, and if this preparation is not needed, the people of all strata of the relevant ethnic groups are still in a state of blindness, which will make ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic coalition governments good policies and systems in name only. Therefore, all localities must resolutely and correctly carry out these policies and systems, both correcting the phenomenon of passive procrastination and preventing hasty actions that abandon preparation.

　　The central link in promoting regional autonomy and ethnic democratic coalition governments is to universally and extensively train cadres of various ethnic minorities. This is also the fundamental link to doing a good job in all ethnic work and ensuring the sound development of all ethnic groups. Just as the human body must have healthy bones to stand up healthily, various ethnic minorities must also have their own ethnic revolutionary backbones in order to accelerate political, economic, and cultural development. This first requires a sufficient number of general political cadres, and as various construction undertakings develop, it is also necessary to gradually increase specialized technical cadres. In the past year, people's governments at all levels have paid great attention to this, and many ethnic cadres have participated in work from the central to local levels. In the Northwest region alone, more than 10,000 ethnic minority cadres, including thirteen ethnic groups, have been promoted and used in the past year. This shows that in the Mao Zedong era, under the people's democratic system, the growth of ethnic minority cadres is very rapid. We believe that in the future, the people of various ethnic minorities will continue to grow more ethnic cadres from their own outstanding children; however, at present, the number of these cadres is still too small and needs to continue to be cultivated in large numbers. Therefore, the State Council of the Central People's Government requires all localities to earnestly and systematically implement the trial plan for training ethnic minority cadres issued last year, adopting the principle of focusing on running political schools and political training classes to train ordinary political cadres, supplemented by urgently needed professional and technical cadres, to train ethnic minority cadres in large numbers to meet urgent needs.

　　According to the experience of the past year, the effective methods for training ethnic minority cadres, in addition to striving to run ethnic schools and training classes well, must also adopt the policy of unity and education, educating the existing personnel in the local area, and giving them appropriate work; extensively absorbing new cadres and educated youth to participate in work, giving them necessary training. When using these methods, attention should be paid not to make unrealistic demands on ethnic minority cadres, such as requiring them to have a relatively high level of education and relatively strong political struggle training. This is impossible. It should be known that the backward state of ethnic minorities caused by reactionary rulers in history must be changed through long-term efforts. Therefore, ethnic minority cadres should be treated correctly, their strengths should be recognized, such as their close ties with the local people, their deep understanding of the local situation, etc., and they should be used boldly; and they should be concerned about their political and theoretical as well as cultural learning at all times, and sincerely help them so that they can be better trained in their work and constantly improve their ideological and political level in order to effectively manage the affairs of their own ethnic groups. Only in this way can the various tasks in ethnic minority areas take root and blossom, and the local people's government and the broad masses establish closer relations.

　　In addition to earnestly and systematically training their own cadres of various ethnic minorities, people's governments at all levels must also send Han cadres who are necessary in quantity and appropriate in quality to participate in and help the work in various ethnic minority areas, and establish friendly and cooperative relations with ethnic minority cadres and the masses, and serve them wholeheartedly. This is extremely important and indispensable for the political, economic, and cultural development of various ethnic minorities.

　　While promoting regional autonomy and training ethnic minority cadres, it is also necessary to help various ethnic minorities restore and develop production, prosper the economy, and appropriately develop their culture and education. In the past year, in the situation where the Chinese People's Liberation War has not been completely concluded, the needs of national defense are still pressing, and the economy can only be restored in key areas, people's governments at all levels have also made great efforts in this regard. The people's governments and the People's Liberation Army in Ningxia and Xinjiang have actively built water conservancy projects, which have been unanimously supported by the people of all ethnic groups. The great achievements in trade work in Qinghai and other places have enabled the people of all ethnic groups to unprecedentedly and well solve the difficulties of supply and demand and have increased a large amount of wealth. For example, during the rule of the Ma Bufang bandits, Tibetan people used 150 kilograms of wool to exchange for a brick of tea, but now they can exchange for 15 bricks. Therefore, the Tibetan people gratefully praised Chairman Mao as the "true living Buddha." The same work has also been done in some areas of Southwest and Central South China. The medical teams and medical work in Inner Mongolia and some ethnic minority areas in the Northwest and Southwest have also been widely praised. Now, the State Council has decided to convene three professional conferences on health, education, and trade related to ethnic minorities in the second half of this year to summarize experience so that the economic and cultural construction of ethnic minority areas can be carried out in a more planned and step-by-step manner, so that various ethnic minorities can gradually get rid of the state of extreme poverty and gradually move towards the future of happiness, prosperity, and a high cultural life.

　　The future of various ethnic minorities is infinitely bright. However, this infinitely bright future is not easy to win. Like the basic liberation of the mainland, the reason why various ethnic minorities have been liberated is the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic and skilled fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the close unity and arduous struggle of the people of all ethnic groups, first of all the Han people, which defeated imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In order to defend this precious fruit of victory, in today's situation where US imperialism is plotting to expand its aggression, it is necessary to universally and deeply carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the home and country in various ethnic minority areas, so that every place and everyone is educated without exception in the patriotism and internationalism of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, so that everyone fully understands why US imperialism is hateful and why our great motherland is lovable, and struggles to defend the sacred border of the motherland.

### 为各民族人民的团结和发展而斗争

　　为各民族人民的团结和发展而斗争
    中央人民政府政务院二月五日公布的关于民族事务的几项决定，是根据中国人民政协共同纲领，和对于各少数民族需要的深刻了解制定的。它指示了发展各少数民族地区政治、经济、文化建设应遵循的轨道，而以推行民族的区域自治和培养少数民族自己的干部，作为当前的中心任务。这是完全符合各族人民利益的举措。它的贯彻实施，必将使我国各民族人民团结和发展的事业大大向前推进一步。
    中华人民共和国的成立，根本改变了各族人民之间的关系，使之由仇视、隔阂转为平等、友爱、互助，给我国各民族人民的团结和发展奠立了牢不可破的基础。一年多以来，各级人民政府和人民解放军依据共同纲领的精神，在增加民族的友爱团结方面，作了许多工作，并已获得很大的成绩。仅是已经圆满和解的民族纠纷即达数千件之多。同时，由于中央人民政府派出西北、西南两个访问团到各少数民族地区进行访问，特别是各少数民族代表来北京参加国庆典礼，使中央对各少数民族的情况和要求有了进一步的了解，使各少数民族对于中央的民族政策有了更深刻的体会。这就巩固与发展了各民族团结、合作的基础。但是，各民族人民之间所残存的仇视、隔阂、歧视和不信任现象，因为有着长久的历史渊源，尚不能完全消除；而帝国主义侵略势力以及隐藏的反革命分子则利用这种空隙，继续进行挑拨离间，故各民族人民之间以及各少数民族内部的团结，还必须努力加强。
    进一步加强民族团结和发展的首要条件，乃是各民族在共同纲领基本精神和中央人民政府统一领导之下，按照他们的大多数人民的意志，经过他们所愿意采取的形式，去管理本民族自己的事务，即在各少数民族聚居地区实行区域自治，经过人民代表会议建立自治机关，而在民族杂居地区，则经过各民族的人民代表会议，建立民族民主联合政府。民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府，是今天中华人民共和国境内解决民族问题和在政治上实现民族平等的最适当最合理的政策。很久以来，各少数民族即被摈斥在政权以外，被剥夺了参政的权利，而为汉民族或其他多数民族的反动统治者所奴役着。中华人民共和国和中央人民政府成立之后，一方面禁止任何民族压迫制度之继续，一方面即指导各级人民政府推行共同纲领的民族政策。一年多以来，各地人民政府，已在一些少数民族聚居地区推行了区域自治，在一些民族杂居地区推行了民族民主联合政府。经验已经证明，在这些地区，各民族人民的积极性都获得适当的发扬，土匪肃清了，“不打冤家了”，从而社会秩序日趋稳定，生产开始恢复和发展，财政税收制度开始建立，其他各项工作亦得到顺利开展。
    民族形式与新民主主义内容开始结合起来，从而展开了各少数民族的光明远景。但是也有一些地区的若干汉族干部，由于对民族政策的认识不足，也由于缺乏经验，他们还不敢认真的推行区域自治及民族民主联合政府的政策和制度；这无疑地是不对的。所以中央人民政府政务院在其决定中要求各大行政区军政委员会（人民政府）指导各有关省、市、行署人民政府认真地推行民族区域自治及民族民主联合政府的政策和制度。我们相信在这个决定颁布之后，一定会有更多的民族自治区和民族民主联合政府出现于我们伟大祖国的各民族大家庭之中。此外，在少数民族中，也有一些人要求毫无准备毫无步骤地实行区域自治和民族民主联合政府，这是由于他们还不了解，无论成立民族区域自治或民族民主联合政府，都必须在有关各民族的各阶层人民中进行政治方面的和组织方面的必要的准备工作，而如果不要这种准备工作，有关各民族的各阶层人民因此还处于盲目状态中，就会使民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府这个好的政策和制度流于有名无实。因此，各地必须坚决而又正确地进行这种政策和制度，既要纠正消极拖延现象，又要防止放弃准备的草率行动。
    推行区域自治和民族民主联合政府的中心环节，是普遍和大量地培养各少数民族自己的干部。这同时又是作好一切民族工作，保证各民族健全发展的根本环节。如同人的身体必须有健全的骨骼才能健全地站起来一样，各少数民族也必须有自己民族的革命骨干，才能够加速政治、经济和文化的发展。这首先需要有足够数量的一般政治干部，而随着各种建设事业的发展，还需要逐渐增多专门的技术干部。过去一年来，各级人民政府对此给予了极大的注意，从中央到地方，已有不少民族干部参加工作。单是西北地区，一年来即已提拔与使用了一万多名少数民族干部，包括了十三种民族。这说明在毛泽东时代，在人民民主制度下，少数民族干部的生长是很快的。我们相信，各少数民族人民今后会从自己的优秀儿女中继续生长出更多的民族干部；不过，在目前，这些干部的数量还是显得太少，还需要继续大量培养。因此，中央人民政府政务院要求各地须认真而有计划地执行去年颁发的培养少数民族干部的试行方案，采取以开办政治学校与政治训练班，培养普通政治干部为主，迫切需要的专业与技术干部为辅的方针，大批培养少数民族干部，以适应紧迫的需要。
    根据过去一年来的经验，培养少数民族干部的有效办法，除了努力办好民族的学校和训练班外；还须采取团结教育的方针，教育当地的现有人员，并给他们以适当的工作；大量吸收新的干部和知识青年参加工作，给以必要的锻炼。在采用这些办法的时候，应该注意，不要对少数民族干部提出不切合实际情况的要求，例如要求他们须有相当高的文化水平，相当强的政治斗争的锻炼，这是不可能的。须知历史上反动统治者所造成的少数民族的落后状态，必须经过长时间的努力才能够改变过来。因此，应该正确地对待少数民族干部，善于认识他们的长处，例如他们与当地人民有密切联系，对当地情况有深刻了解等等，放手使用他们；并时刻关心他们政治的和理论的以及文化的学习，热诚地帮助他们，使之在工作中得到更好的锻炼，不断提高思想政治水平，以便有效地来管理本民族的事务。只有这样，才能使少数民族地区的各项工作生根开花，使当地的人民政府和广大群众建立更加亲密的关系。
    各级人民政府除了认真地有计划地培养各少数民族自己的干部而外，还必须调派数量上必需和质量上适当的汉民族干部去参加和帮助各少数民族地区的工作，并使他们同少数民族的干部和群众建立友爱合作的关系，诚心诚意为他们服务，这对于各少数民族的政治、经济和文化的发展，是极其重要而且不可缺少的。
    与推行区域自治、培养少数民族干部同时，还必须帮助各少数民族恢复与发展生产，繁荣经济以及适当地发展其文化和教育。过去一年来，在中国人民解放战争尚未完全结束，国防需要仍然迫切，经济还只能是重点恢复的情况下，各级人民政府在这方面也尽了极大的努力。宁夏、新疆的人民政府和人民解放军积极兴修水利，获得了各民族人民的一致拥护。青海等地在贸易工作方面的巨大成绩，已使当地各民族人民空前良好地解决了供给和需要的困难，并且增加了大批财富。例如，在马匪步芳统治时期，藏民用一百五十斤羊毛换一块砖茶，现在可换十五块。因此，藏民族人民感激地称颂毛主席为“真正的活佛”。在西南、中南某些地区也作了同样的工作。在内蒙和西北、西南某些少数民族地区的医疗队和医疗工作，同样获得广泛的称赞。现在，政务院已决定于今年下半年召开有关少数民族的卫生、教育及贸易三个专业会议，总结经验，以便更有计划有步骤地来开展少数民族地区的经济、文化建设事业，使各少数民族逐步地摆脱极端贫困的状态，向着幸福繁荣和高度文化生活的前途逐步前进。
    各少数民族的前途是无限光明的。但是，这个无限光明的前途，并不是容易赢得的。如同全国大陆的基本解放一样，各少数民族之所以获得解放，乃是伟大领袖毛主席、中国共产党的英明领导，人民解放军的英勇善战，全国各民族人民首先是汉民族人民的紧密团结，艰苦斗争，战胜了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的结果。为了保卫这可珍贵的胜利果实，在美帝国主义阴谋扩张侵略的今天，在各少数民族地区，必须普遍与深入地开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动，使每一处、每一人都无例外地受到抗美援朝的爱国主义与国际主义教育，使每一个人全懂得美帝国主义之所以可恨，我们伟大祖国之所以可爱，为捍卫祖国的神圣边疆而斗争。
