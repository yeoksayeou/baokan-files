    Since our army accepted the glorious and great task of marching into Tibet to liberate Tibet, we have received the kind concern and enthusiastic encouragement from the people of all circles in various parts of the country, and have successively received more than 20,000 letters of condolences and a large number of慰劳品 transferred from all parts of the country, which has made all our comrades more determined to march into Tibet to liberate Tibet, and to consolidate and improve the determination to build our great motherland's national defense.
    Now, in addition to actively preparing for the next great task of marching into Lhasa and liberating all Tibetan brothers, all our comrades are also carrying out patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our home and country throughout the army, and a climax of loving our great motherland has already been formed.

And pay our highest respects.
