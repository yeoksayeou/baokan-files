　　Hua Dong People's Revolutionary University Nanjing Branch Organization Department Director Xu Dong, instead of adopting a supportive and leading attitude towards the peasants' just land reform movement, adopted an attitude of hostility and sabotage. This is extremely wrong; it also exposes his landlord stance.

　　Although Xu Dong had received a long period of education from the Party, because he was not determined to change his landlord stance, even if he had not shown any direct interference in the peasants' land reform movement in the past, it was only because it had not yet harmed his interests, so he verbally agreed. But when the peasants wanted to revolutionize the lives of his landlord family, he stood up and interfered at all costs, resolutely shielding his own landlord family, not only "defending" his family but also helping another landlord to evade land reform; not only illegally extracting his criminal father to talk with the Wuxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at will, sending his mother and wife to the People's Government to "appeal," but also constantly writing letters to accuse the Wuxi County Committee, and also writing more than eighteen pages of propaganda that sabotaged land reform, distributing it everywhere, in order to undermine the peasants' land reform movement. All this fully demonstrates Xu Dong's reactionary landlord stance. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's expulsion of Xu Dong from the Party is entirely correct.

　　In dealing with the Xu Juchu issue, the attitude of the Wuxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuxi County People's Government was not serious enough. In some issues, they did not handle the problem in accordance with the opinions of the people and the established laws and regulations of the People's Government, but adopted some wrong practices in order to take care of some people's "feelings". After the arrest of the bully landlord Xu Juchu, instead of soliciting the opinions of the masses on how to handle it, they first wrote a letter to solicit Xu Dong's opinion. When Xu Dong arrived in Wuxi, he was allowed to arbitrarily extract the prisoner from the government prison and talk with the leading organs of the Party without principle. This shows that they have lost the principles of the Party and have shown an irresponsible attitude towards the Party and the people. They should make a public self-criticism to the people.

　　破坏土地改革的党员必须受到最严重处分
    华东人民革命大学南京分校组织处长徐栋，对农民的正义的土地改革运动，不是采取支持与领导的态度，而是采取仇视与破坏的态度。这是极端错误的；这也就暴露了他的地主立场。
    徐栋虽曾受过党长期的教育，但因为他并没有决心来改变自己的地主立场，因此，即使他过去还没有表现出对农民的土地改革运动采取直接干涉的行为，那也只是因为还没有伤害到他的利益，因此口头上还赞成。但是当农民要革他的地主家庭的命时，他就不顾一切的站出来干涉，坚决地包庇自己的地主家庭，不仅替自己家庭进行“辩护”，并帮助另一个地主逃避土地改革；不仅违法地随便提取他犯罪的父亲到中共无锡县委会谈话，派他母亲妻子到人民政府“申辩”，而且不断地写信指责无锡县委会，还写了十八页多的破坏土地改革的宣传品，到处散发，以破坏农民的土地改革运动。这一切充分说明了徐栋的反动的地主立场。中共南京市委会开除徐栋的党籍，是完全正确的。
    在处理徐菊初的问题中，中共无锡县委会与无锡县人民政府的态度是不够严肃的，他们在某些问题上并不是按照人民的意见，人民政府既定的法令来处理这一问题，而是为了照顾某些人的“情面”而采取了一些错误的作法。在逮捕了恶霸地主徐菊初后，不是向人民群众征求处理的意见，而是先写信去征求徐栋的意见。当徐栋到无锡后，又毫无原则地让徐栋随便从政府监狱中提取犯人，并到党的领导机关进行谈话。这说明了他们丧失了党的原则，对党对人民表现了不负责任的态度。他们应该向人民进行公开的检讨。
