　　Emphasize Welfare Work for Female Workers

Since liberation, the role played by female workers in factories across the country fully demonstrates that female workers are no weaker than male workers in terms of production or learning. The fact that many female labor models have emerged in various places over the past year proves the immense strength of women on this production front. However, it must also be acknowledged that female workers have their own unique difficulties in production. If we cannot improve the working conditions of female workers, strengthen safety and health equipment for female workers, properly protect infants, and alleviate their various special difficulties, then the production and learning of female workers will inevitably be greatly affected. This principle is very simple. However, the administrative side or the capitalists of many factories have not paid due attention to this. Some places only emphasize financial difficulties and have not seriously come up with various ways to solve the difficulties; some emphasize production first and abandon welfare work for female workers; and some factories even disregard the special physiological conditions of pregnant women in production competitions and crash work. This phenomenon of not paying attention to the welfare work of female workers has already caused difficulties in production and life for female workers in many places. This urgently needs to be taken seriously by all regions.

Factories that do a good job in female worker welfare work will definitely see a great increase in the production efficiency of female workers. This is an important experience of factories in various regions. In the production competition of last May, Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 3 had twenty-five female workers with children who received red flags. Zhang Yuzhen, a female worker at the Shenyang Rubber Factory who brushes shoe soles, has increased her daily output from 360 pairs to 640 pairs since sending her four children to the nursery. Han Chunlan, a female worker at the Jinzhou Cotton Mill, increased her spinning from twelve carts of yarn to forty-two carts of yarn after sending her child to the nursery. These examples are persuasive. But some people may say, "I know that doing a good job in female worker welfare work can promote production. What can I do if there are financial difficulties that cannot be solved?" The facts of the past year have also proven that as long as we attach importance to the welfare work of female workers, take some necessary measures, and rely on the workers and trade union organizations to solve the problems, we will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties. Isn't that so? Many factories have now stipulated the treatment for pregnant female workers during maternity leave (such as stipulating that female workers who are seven months pregnant do not work night shifts or work overtime), and some factories have also established mutual aid covenants to take care of pregnant female workers. Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and some factories in the Northeast have conducted physical examinations for female workers to initially understand the health status of female workers, and some have also established factory maternal and child health research groups to formulate specific methods in a planned way to improve the health of female workers. Some places also hold health lectures to conduct systematic maternal and child health education. These methods have already been proven to be completely feasible in various places.

Therefore, we must not use difficulties as an excuse to ignore certain reasonable demands of female workers. All factories with female workers should earnestly do a good job in female worker welfare work, because this is of great benefit to production. The trade union should take the initiative to supervise and promote this. The Party, administration, and trade unions of state-owned factories should truly understand the health status of female workers and formulate effective and currently feasible methods to protect the health of female workers, so that they can move forward boldly on the production front.

### 重视女工福利工作

　　重视女工福利工作
    解放以后，全国各地工厂中女工所起的作用可以充分说明：无论在生产或是学习等方面，女工都不弱于男工。一年来各地涌现出很多妇女劳动模范的事实，便可以证明妇女这一支生产战线的力量是何等巨大。但也必须承认：女工在生产中是有其特殊困难的。如果，我们不能够很好地改善女工的劳动条件，加强女工安全卫生设备，妥善地进行婴儿保护，解除他们各种特殊困难，那么，女工的生产和学习必然会受到极大的影响。这个道理十分简单。但是，很多工厂的行政方面或资方却对此没有给以应有的重视。有些地方只是强调财政经济困难，没有认真地想出各种办法来解决困难，有的强调生产第一而放弃了对女工的福利工作，甚至有的工厂在生产竞赛和突击工作中，连怀孕妇女的特殊生理情况也都不顾了。这种不重视女工福利工作的现象，已经在很多地方造成了女工生产上和生活上的困难。亟应引起各地重视。
    凡是女工福利工作做得好的工厂，女工们生产效率一定大大提高。这是各地工厂的一条重要经验。天津国营棉纺织第三厂在去年五月的生产竞赛中，即有二十五个有孩子的女工得到了红旗。沈阳橡胶厂刷鞋底的女工张玉珍，自从把四个孩子送入托儿所后，每天产量由三百六十双增至六百四十双。锦州棉纺厂女工韩春兰将孩子送入托儿所后，她由摇十二车纱增到摇四十二车纱。这些例子是具有说服性的。可是也有人会说，“做好女工福利工作能够推动生产，我是知道的。财政有困难无法解决怎样办？”一年来事实也证明了，只要我们重视女工福利工作，采取一些必要的措施，依靠工人群众和工会组织来解决，便一定有办法克服困难。不是吗？现在有很多工厂已经规定了怀孕女工生产假期的待遇（如规定怀孕七个月的女工不作夜班，不加工），有的工厂还订立了照顾怀孕女工的互助公约。上海、天津、青岛及东北的一部分工厂，为女工检查身体，初步了解了女工健康状况，有的还成立工厂妇婴卫生的研究小组，有步骤地制出具体办法，改善女工健康。也有的地方举办卫生讲座，进行系统的妇婴卫生教育。这些办法已经在各地证明是完全可行的。
    因此，绝不能借口困难，而不顾女工的某些合理要求。一切有女工的工厂都应当认真地把女工福利工作作好，因为，这对生产有着极大好处的。工会对此应主动地进行监督和推动。国营工厂的党、行政以及工会更应真正了解女工健康状况，定出有效的现在可行的办法来保护女工的健康，使她们能在生产战线上放手地向前迈进。
