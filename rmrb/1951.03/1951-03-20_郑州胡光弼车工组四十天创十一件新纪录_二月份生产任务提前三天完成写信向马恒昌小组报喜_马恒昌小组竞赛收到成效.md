　　The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Kaifeng Repair and Assembly Plant's Hu Guangbi Lathe Group has achieved significant improvements in production work after responding to the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Group. The group's workers recently wrote a letter to the Ma Hengchang Group to report the good news. The letter stated: Since accepting the challenge on January 26th, in the forty-plus days up to the 13th of this month, all thirteen members of the group have created eleven new records, earning 250,000 yuan in bonuses. For example, worker Li Qingrui previously required 53 minutes and 57 seconds to make a gauge standard ruler for rail joints, but has now shortened it to 29 minutes and 47 seconds, increasing output by 81 percent. They have also paid special attention to maintaining the line shaft and machine tools, and have not had a single accident for more than forty days. Due to the increased production efficiency and good machine maintenance, the group completed its February production tasks three days ahead of schedule, with a product qualification rate of over 99 percent. The technical research association established by the group to learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group has held three meetings, which have been very effective. Some young workers have improved their skills and created new records as a result. The group also regularly holds review meetings, criticizing each other, ensuring that no one is late or wastes working hours and materials.

    马恒昌小组竞赛收到成效
    郑州铁路局开封修配厂胡光弼车工组，向马恒昌小组应战后，生产工作获显著提高。该组工友特于日前写信向马恒昌小组报喜。信中说：自从元月二十六日应战后，到本月十三日的四十多天中，全组十三人已有六人创造出十一件新纪录，得了二十五万元奖金。如工友李庆瑞过去做一件轨缝定规器标准尺需要五十三分五十七秒，现已缩短到二十九分四十七秒，使产量提高百分之八十一。他们还特别注意保养了天轴和机床，持续四十多天没出一件事故。由于生产效率的提高以及机器保养得好，全组二月份的生产任务即提前三天完成，产品合格率达百分之九十九以上。该组学习马恒昌小组经验建立起来的技术研究会，已开过三次会议，收效很大。有的青年工人因此提高技术而创造了新纪录。该组还经常召开检讨会，互相批评，作到没有一人迟到或浪费工时和材料。
