　　Basic Methods of Party Work
    ——Pravda Editorial

    Editor's Note: The method of persuasion is the basic method of the Party's leadership work. This is a fundamental principle of the Communist Party organization. This article elucidates this very well and can be used for study and reference by Party committees at all levels.

    Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, our country is successfully completing the great task of communist construction. The strength and invincibility of the Bolshevik leadership lie in its inseparable connection with the masses, in the full and unlimited support of the people for the Party's policies, which express the vital interests of the workers and form the solid foundation of the Soviet system.

    Comrade Stalin taught that leadership means being able to convince the masses of the correctness of the Party's policies, put forward and implement slogans that can lead the masses to the Party, and make it easy for them to discern the correctness of the Party's policies in their own experience, raising the masses to the level of the Party's understanding, thereby guaranteeing the masses' support and their readiness for resolute struggle.

    The method of persuasion is the basic method of Party leadership. Our Party organizations explain the Party's policies to the workers, convince them of its correctness, and then mobilize the masses to participate in the struggle to successfully complete communist construction.

    Now, local Party organizations, in order to combine economic achievements with the achievements of the Party's political work and advance simultaneously, are turning to the Party's political issues. The important task of communist construction requires Party organizations to continuously improve their leadership over all economic and cultural sectors. The reliable way to achieve new achievements is to raise the level of the Party's organizational and political work.

    Party work is a lively, creative undertaking, not formalistic; commandism has nothing to do with it and is incompatible with the spirit of our Party. The spirit of our Party is militant, actively thinking, self-organizing, living a lively life, and creating new things. Party workers are political leaders, active fighters for the realization of the Party's policies, organizers and educators of the people. His duty, his mission, is to educate people and cadres with the thought of the Lenin-Stalin Party in their work.

    An important task of the Party is the political education of the general public and the organization of the masses to complete the current tasks of the republic, province, region, enterprise, and collective farm. The working methods of Party organs are completely different from those of administrative and economic organs. The method of persuasion—the basic method of the Party in mass work—has a decisive significance in all Party life. Commandism is never allowed in Party work because it harms the autonomy of Party organizations, binds the initiative and enthusiasm of Party members, and harms the cause of correctly educating cadres and all Party members.

    At the Party congresses held in many cities and districts, Party members sharply criticized those who engaged in organizational and educational work of cadres by means of command methods instead of persuasive methods.

    For example, at the Party Congress of Privolzhsky District in Ivanovo Province, the representatives rightly criticized the incorrect and flawed working methods of the District Party Committee. The Privolzhsky District Committee replaced the Soviet and economic organs, engaged in trivial economic affairs, and forgot the Party's political work. The secretary of the District Committee led the collective farms and neglected the leadership of the grassroots Party organizations. Here, the work of cadres was wasted, and no attention was paid to the work of educating cadres. The District Committee often punished Communist Party members without sufficient reason and expelled many of them from the Party. The unsound leadership methods of the District Committee led to the weakening of its ties with the masses and its inability to regularly influence the work of enterprises, institutions, and collective farms. As a result, this once-advanced district became a backward district. The congress acknowledged that the work of the District Committee was unsatisfactory and did not elect the former secretary as a member of the District Committee.

    High strictness towards Party leaders, Bolshevik-style uncompromisingness towards shortcomings, and courageous and principled criticism to improve all Party work are the characteristics of the Party conferences being held now. The Party masses condemned the incorrect working methods of leaders who had bureaucratic habits and did not value the opinions of activists and ordinary Party members. Party workers who are arrogant and try to drag unsound, bureaucratic methods into the work of Party organizations do not gain the trust and respect of Party members.

    Comrade Ruzhenko, the secretary of the Party Committee of Veliko-Polovetsky District in Kiev Province, behaved like an ordinary administrator. He did not consult with activists, did not listen to the opinions of the Standing Committee members of the District Committee, and did not heed the advice and suggestions of Party members; and declared that he did not need these advices. The representatives of the district's Party congress did well not to elect this arrogant leader as a member of the District Committee.

    Some Party workers often replace the education of cadres and Party members with the extreme method of Party discipline. They always think that rebuke is an effective method, and do not feel that persuasion, like strictness, is the most reliable method to consolidate conscious Party discipline.

    For example, the Standing Committee of the Orsha District Party Committee of Kalinin Province stood on this incorrect road. This Standing Committee punished nine Party members in one of its meetings, five of whom were chairmen of collective farms and secretaries of grassroots Party organizations. Obviously, such leadership methods would bring harm to the cause of educating cadres.

    Correct leadership requires every Party worker and activist to have close contact with the broad masses of Party and non-Party members. He should sensitively listen to the voices of the masses, educate the masses and learn from the masses. It is necessary for leading Party workers to systematically visit enterprises and collective farms and make political reports at workers' and collective farmers' meetings.

    Party organs should give special attention to making every effort to develop inner-Party democracy, guiding all Party members to actively participate in Party life, and educating them in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

    Correct leadership must always take into account the Bolshevik-style concern for the ideological arming of our cadres, and how to educate them in lively practical work and in overcoming difficulties. It should always be remembered that the success of any cause depends on cadres and people. The primary task of Party leaders is to constantly teach cadres, to provide them with the most reliable methods for completing this or that task when they need help and encouragement, and when they have made initial achievements, not to begrudge the time to teach them, to patiently and enthusiastically take care of them, and to make them grow. Naturally, this matter is much more complicated than writing general resolutions or issuing orders. Vigorous and concrete leadership requires knowledge, patience, sensitivity, and concern for cadres.

    Our Party has cultivated many cadres who are infinitely loyal to the great cause of Lenin-Stalin. These cadres have dedicated all their energy to the realization of the Party's policies, they are carrying out tremendous organizational and educational work among the masses, and are uniting the Soviet people more closely around the Bolshevik Party.

    Party organizations must continuously improve the level of the Party's organizational and educational work, and improve methods of leadership in order to achieve new achievements in communist construction.

### 党工作的基本方法——真理报社论

　　党工作的基本方法
    ——真理报社论
    编者按：说服的方法是党领导工作的基本方法，这是共产党组织的一条基本原则，本文对此有很好的阐明，可供各级党委研究参考。
    在列宁——斯大林的党的领导下，我国成功地完成着共产主义建设的伟大任务。布尔什维克领导的力量和不可战胜性，在于与群众有不可分离的联系，在于人民对表现出劳动者切身利益并构成苏维埃制度坚固基础的党的政策，予以充分而无限的拥护。
    斯大林同志教导说，领导就是说能够使群众相信党的政策的正确性，提出并贯彻这样的口号，这些口号能把群众引向党这方面来，并使他们在自己经验上易于辨别党政策的正确性，把群众提高到党的认识的水平，因之保证了群众的拥护和他们对坚决斗争的准备。
    说服的方法是党领导的基本方法。我们的党组织对劳动者解释党的政策，使他们相信它的正确性，进而动员群众参加争取顺利完成共产主义建设的斗争。
    现在，地方党组织为了使经济上的成就与党的政治工作的成就结合起来同时并进，正转向党的政治问题这方面。共产主义建设的重要任务，是要求党组织不断改善对一切经济与文化部门的领导。获得新成就的可靠方法，就是使党的组织的和政治的工作的水平提高。
    党的工作是生动的，创造性的事业，而不是形式主义的；命令主义与它是毫无关系的，而且与我党的本来精神是不相融合的。我党的精神是战斗的，积极思考的，自动组织的，过着生动生活，创造新事物的。党的工作人员是政治领导者，他是争取实现党的政策的积极战士，是人们的组织者和教育者。他的义务，他的使命就是对于人和干部的工作，以列宁、斯大林党的思想教育他们。
    党的重要工作是对一般人的政治教育和组织群众完成共和国、省、区、企业及集体农场的当前任务。党机关的工作方法与行政机关和经济机关的工作方法是完全不同的。说服的方法——党在群众工作中的基本方法——在全部党生活中有着决定性的意义。命令主义在党工作中是决不被允许的，因为它损害党组织的自动性，把共产党员的主动性和积极性束缚起来，并且给正确地教育干部和全体党员的事业带来害处。
    在许多城市和区所开过的党的代表大会上，党员们锐利地批评那些不用说服方法而以命令方法从事组织和教育干部工作的人们。
    例如在伊凡诺夫省，朴里沃斯区的党的代表大会上，代表们正当地批评了党的区委会的不正确的、有缺点的工作方法。朴里沃斯区委会代替了苏维埃机关和经济机关，从事于经济的琐碎事务而忘掉了党的政治工作。区委会书记领导了集体农场而疏忽了对基层党组织的领导。在这里，干部的工作被荒废了，没有注意教育干部的工作。区委会常常没有充足的理由就处罚共产党员，并把其中许多开除了党籍。区委会的不健全的领导方法，导致它削弱了与群众的联系，不能经常影响企业、机关和集体农场的工作。其结果，这个较早的先进区变成了落后区了。代表大会承认了区委会的工作是不能使人满意的，而且未曾把从前的书记选为该区委会的委员。
    对党的领导者的高度严格性，对缺点的布尔什维克式的不妥协性，提高党的全部工作的勇敢的和原则性的批评，是现在举行的党的代表会议的特点。党的群众指责那些有官僚习气，和不重视积极分子及普通共产党员的意见的领导者的不正确的工作方法。自高自大的，企图把不健全的、官僚主义的方法拖进党组织的工作人员，是得不到共产党员的信任与尊敬的。
    基辅省的维里科·波洛维次区的党委会书记鲁金科同志的行为，像一位普通的行政官一样，他不与积极分子商量，不听取区委会常委会委员的意见，也不理睬共产党员的劝告和建议；而且宣称，他不需要这些劝告。区的党代表大会的代表们作得很对，不选举这位自高自大的领导者作区委会委员。
    有些党的工作人员时常用党的处分这种极端方法代替了对干部和共产党员的教育。他们总是认为斥责是有效的方法，并没有感到说服正与严格性一样，是巩固自觉的党的纪律的最可靠的方法。
    例如，加里宁省奥尔申区党委会常委会就站在这个不正确的道路上。这个常委会在自己的一个会议上就处罚了九个共产党员，其中五个是集体农场主席和基层党组织书记。很明显地，类似这样的领导方法会给教育干部的事业带来了损害。
    正确的领导要使每个党的工作人员和积极分子，与党和非党的广大群众有密切的接触。他应当敏感地听取群众的呼声，教育群众和向群众学习。必要的是党的领导工作人员有步骤地访问企业和集体农场，并在工人和集体农场大会上作政治报告。
    党机关对于尽力发展党内民主，引导全体共产党员积极参加党生活和以批评与自我批评精神教育他们，应给予特殊的注意。
    正确的领导要经常考虑到布尔什维克式地关怀我们干部的思想武装，怎样设法在活生生的实际工作中，在克服困难中来教育他们。应当永记，任何事业的成功是决定于干部和人的。党领导者的首要任务是经常教导干部，当他们需要帮助和鼓励他们的时候，当他们有了初步成绩的时候，应把完成这个或那个任务的最可靠的方法提示给他们，不要吝惜教导他们的时间，忍耐而热心地照顾他们，使他们成长起来。自然，这件事情比写一般决议或发号施令要繁杂的多。生气勃勃的，具体的领导是要求知识、忍耐、敏感和对干部的关切。
    我们的党培养了许多对列宁——斯大林的伟大事业无限忠诚的干部。这些干部为实现党的政策而供献出自己的全部精力，他们在群众中进行着巨大的组织和教育工作，并把苏维埃人更紧密地团结在布尔什维克党的周围。
    党组织要不断地提高党的组织工作的和教育工作的水平，改善领导的方法，以在共产主义建设中获致新的成就。
