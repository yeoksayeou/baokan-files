"People's Weekly" Reduces Price to Promote Circulation

    "People's Weekly," which was first published in October 1950, has reduced its price from 1,600 yuan to 1,000 yuan per issue, starting with the recently published issue No. 9 of 1951, in order to meet the needs of a wider readership. "People's Weekly" is a weekly selection of articles from the "People's Daily," and its content includes the most important documents, editorials, commentaries, reviews, news reports, and literary works published in the "People's Daily" each week. The purpose of publishing "People's Weekly" is to enable readers who wish to read the "People's Daily" but cannot afford to subscribe to obtain the important content of the "People's Daily" at a low price, and to facilitate reading, reference, and preservation. "People's Weekly" also provides considerable convenience for readers in areas far from the capital and abroad. It can expand the connection between the "People's Daily" and the masses and further enhance the role of the "People's Daily."

　　《人民周报》减低定价推广发行
    在一九五○年十月发刊的人民周报，为了适应广大读者的需要，已由最近出版的一九五一年第九期起将每期定价由一千六百元减低为一千元。人民周报的性质是人民日报的每周文选，内容包括人民日报每周登载的最重要的文件、社论、专论、述评、通讯和文艺作品。人民周报发刊的目的，是为了使愿读人民日报而又无力订阅的读者能以低廉的价格得到人民日报的重要内容，并便于阅读、查考和保存。人民周报对于国内离首都较远的地方和国外的读者，也有不少便利。它可以扩大人民日报和群众的联系，进一步发挥人民日报的作用。
