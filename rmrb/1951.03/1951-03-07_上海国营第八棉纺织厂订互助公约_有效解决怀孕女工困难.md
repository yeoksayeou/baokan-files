　　Shanghai State-Owned No. 8 Cotton Mill Establishes Mutual Aid Pact
　　Effectively Solve Difficulties of Pregnant Female Workers
　　The trade union of Shanghai State-Owned No. 8 Cotton Mill has mobilized workers to establish a mutual aid pact, initially solving the problem of protecting the health of pregnant female workers. The factory has a total of 1,350 female workers. According to statistics from January 1950, pregnant women accounted for 9.4% of the factory's total female workforce. According to incomplete statistics, the number of miscarriages among female workers in 1950 accounted for 4% of the total number of births (difficult births and stillbirths not included). The impact on the health of pregnant female workers during the production process is very serious. Wang Xiaomei, a female worker in the opening and cleaning workshop, was eight months pregnant and had great difficulty moving around, but she still had to pick up cotton from the ground and send it to the machine non-stop, carrying about 3,000 pounds of cotton every day, bending her body at a 30-degree angle to the ground. Wang Xiaomei was so tired that she was sweating and out of breath. Sun Lingying, a female worker who winds the yarn at the spinning frame in the fine spinning workshop, was pregnant and about to give birth, and had to squat down to wind the yarn 128 times a day when doffing. She sometimes dared not eat during the day for fear that she would not be able to squat down if she ate too much, and often worked on an empty stomach. Lu Lanying, a doffer, suffered from malposition of the fetus because she had to squat down every day to wipe the machine legs, causing her entire abdomen to be skewed. She was treated and corrected by the factory's health clinic, which avoided the risk of dystocia. However, her body was weak after childbirth, and she did not return to work until after more than 100 days. The increased intensity of labor in the production competition has resulted in many pregnant women taking leave. Recently, during the patriotic production competition in the factory, a female worker in the roving workshop had a miscarriage due to pressure on her waist from carrying yarn.
　　After the Shanghai Working Group of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, together with cadres from the Women Workers' Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, learned about this situation in January of this year, they worked with the factory trade union to widely solicit opinions from workshop committee members, female foremen, veteran female workers, and female workers who had had miscarriages, and held a special forum for pregnant women representatives. After synthesizing opinions from all parties, it was decided that the current method of mobilizing workers' mutual assistance should be used to initially solve the health problems of pregnant female workers. The factory trade union focused on the fourth group of the fine spinning workshop as the focus of its work in order to gain experience.
　　The fourth group of the fine spinning workshop has a total of 30 workers, with four pregnant women about to give birth. After individual talks and universal deliberation, Zhou A'mei, the female worker committee member of the trade union, convened a group meeting on January 19 to explain the difficulties and pain of pregnant female workers and the impact on production, using examples from the group's workers, to inspire everyone's class friendship and enthusiasm for caring for production, and a mutual aid pact was established on the spot. The contents of the mutual aid pact are: (1) When a female worker is "coming happy" (i.e., pregnant), she must take the initiative to tell the workshop's female worker committee member. She should pay attention to protecting her body in every way, not carrying overly heavy objects, and not taking or placing things from overly high places. (2) When a spinning worker is pregnant, the spinning workers on her left and right aisles will help her carry the bobbin box. The doffers will help her connect the yarn ends at any time to reduce her fatigue. (3) When a doffer is pregnant, the spinning worker will exchange the work of wiping the machine legs and connecting yarn ends with her. (4) When a winder or a long doffer is pregnant, the doffers will help her wind the yarn. (5) The female worker committee members of the workshop should care for pregnant women, supervise everyone to implement the pact, and be responsible for informing the administrative负责人 (responsible person) to take care of pregnant women and assign lighter work within the possible range.
　　The next day, the fourth group's mutual aid pact was posted on the big red bulletin board, which immediately caused a sensation throughout the entire fine spinning workshop. The female workers praised in unison: "The trade union is really considerate of us!" In particular, the female workers who had had miscarriages were even more envious and said: "This method is really good, if it had been implemented earlier, I wouldn't have had a miscarriage."
　　The establishment of the mutual aid pact not only solved the difficulties of pregnant female workers, but also further inspired the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance among the workers, and expanded the scope of mutual aid: doffers help spinning workers connect yarn ends, spinning workers help doffers wipe machine legs; doffers help winders wind yarn, and winders teach doffers winding techniques. Everyone proposed: "Don't let a single yarn end break on the fine spinning machine," and the production situation was therefore improved.
　　The A and B shifts of the fine spinning workshop, as well as the opening and cleaning, carding, roving, doubling, foreign yarn, packing, weaving and other workshops, have all established mutual aid pacts based on the specific difficulties of pregnant women in their departments. Gu Zhou, a female worker who rolls back yarn in the opening and cleaning workshop, automatically exchanged work with Wang Xiaomei, a female worker who carries cotton clothing who was seven months pregnant; in the cone winding workshop, pregnant female workers who were farthest from the "yarn dispensing point" were transferred to machines closer to the point, and yarn dispensing workers helped deliver the yarn boxes when taking yarn. Many male workers were also moved to compete to help pregnant female workers sweep floor waste and carry heavy objects. They said, "I also have wives and sisters who are pregnant, and everyone should help each other."

　　上海国营第八棉纺织厂订互助公约
    有效解决怀孕女工困难
    上海国营第八棉纺织厂工会发动工人订立互助公约，初步解决保护怀孕女工的健康问题。该厂女工共一千三百五十人。据一九五○年一月份的统计：孕妇占全厂女工总数的百分之九·四。又据不完全的统计，一九五○年流产的女工占产妇总数的百分之四（难产、死产的未计在内）。怀孕女工在生产过程中影响健康的情况十分严重。清花间女工王小妹怀孕八个月，行动很不方便，但仍需一刻不停地从地上抱起棉花送到车上，每天要抱棉花三千磅左右，身体弯下与地面成三十度角。王小妹因此累得汗流浃背，喘不过气来。细纱间摇车头女工孙玲英怀孕待产，每天落纱时要蹲下摇车一百二十八次。她白天有时就不敢吃饭，怕吃多了蹲不下来，常常饿着肚子干活。落纱工陆兰英因为每天要蹲下揩车脚，致胎位不正，整个腹部外形歪偏。经该厂卫生事务所医治拨正，始避免难产的危险。但她在产后身体因此虚弱，停了一百多天才上工。生产竞赛中劳动强度提高，孕妇请假的很多。最近，该厂在进行爱国主义生产竞赛中，粗纱间有女工因扛纱腰部受压而流产。
    中华全国总工会女工部上海工作组协同上海总工会女工部干部于今年一月至该厂了解此等情况后，即协同该厂工会普遍征求各车间委员、女领班、老女工以及流产过的女工的意见，并专门召开了孕妇代表座谈会。综合各方意见之后，确定目前以发动工友互助的办法来初步解决怀孕女工的健康问题。该厂工会以细纱间第四小组作为工作重点，以求取得经验。
    细纱间第四组工人共三十人，有四个临产孕妇。经过个别谈话和普遍酝酿以后，工会女工委员周阿妹于一月十九日召集小组会，以本组工友的例子说明怀孕女工的困难、痛苦及影响生产的情况，启发大家的阶级友爱及关心生产的热情，当场订立了互助公约。互助公约的内容为：（一）女工来喜（即怀孕）的时候，一定主动告诉车间女工委员。自己处处注意保重身体，不拿过重的东西，不从过高的地方取放东西。（二）当车工怀孕后，在她左右弄堂的当车工替她把简管箱搬上。落纱工随时帮助她接头，以减少她的疲累。（三）落纱工怀孕后，当车工与她交换揩车脚、接头工作。（四）摇车头、落纱长怀孕后，落纱工帮她接车。（五）车间女工委员要关心孕妇，督促大家执公行约，并负责转告行政负责人，在可能范围内照顾孕妇，调配较轻工作。
    次日，四组的互助公约贴在大红榜上，马上轰动了整个细纱间。女工们异口同声赞扬：“工会真体贴我们！”特别是曾经流产过的女工更是赞羡不已地说：“这办法真好，早实行了，我也不会小产了。”
    互助公约的订立，不仅怀孕女工的困难得以解决，并进一步启发了工友们的友爱互助精神，推广了互助范围：落纱工帮助当车工接头，当车工帮助落纱工揩车脚；落纱工帮助摇车头摇车，摇车头教给落纱工摇车技术。大家提出：“不使细纱车多断一根头”，生产情况因而改善。
    细纱间甲乙班、清钢、粗纱、并线、洋线、打包、织部等各车间都根据本部门孕妇的具体困难，订立了互助公约。清花间轧回丝女工顾周氏自动与怀孕七月的抱花衣女工王小妹交换工作；筒子间将距离“派纱处”最远的怀孕女工调到靠近的车上，取纱时派纱工友帮着将纱箱送上。许多男工也感动得抢着帮助怀孕女工扫脚花，提重物。他们说：“我也有老婆姊妹怀孕的时候，大家互相帮助是应该的。”
