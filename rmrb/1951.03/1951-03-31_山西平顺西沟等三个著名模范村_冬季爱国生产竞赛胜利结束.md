The Winter Patriotic Production Competition Victoriously Concluded in Three Famous Model Villages in Pingshun, Shanxi

Deepening political education, frequent inspection and promotion by cadres, and the leadership of labor models were the reasons for ensuring the victorious completion of the competition plan.

The winter patriotic production competition in the three model villages of Xigou, Chuandi, and Jiebankao in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has victoriously concluded. The production competition in these three villages was launched during the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. In November of last year, the Li Shunda mutual aid team in Xigou Village unanimously proposed to carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign with practical actions to improve production, and took the lead in proposing to farmers throughout Shanxi Province to launch a winter patriotic production competition; the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team in Chuandi Village and the Yang Fengshan mutual aid team in Jiebankao Village immediately responded. Under the influence of these three labor models' mutual aid teams, the three villages launched a competition and jointly challenged the entire province.

In order to further promote the patriotic production movement and fully turn to spring plowing production to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest in 1951, the Pingshun County-level leading organs sent one cadre each from the County People's Government, the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the County New Democratic Youth League, and the Democratic Women's Federation, plus the heads of the three villages' direct districts and the three labor models, including Li Shunda, to form an inspection and evaluation committee. They conducted a five-day in-depth inspection of the winter production competition in the three villages. The inspection results showed that all three villages had basically completed and partially exceeded their plans. For example, the three villages originally planned to plow once in the autumn, but in addition to completing the plan, Xigou Village plowed 64 percent of its cultivated land twice, and Chuandi Village plowed 33 percent twice. Regarding fertilizer preparation, Xigou Village originally planned to accumulate 105 dan of fertilizer per mu, but has now accumulated 119 dan (excluding green manure); Chuandi Village originally planned to accumulate 88 dan of fertilizer per mu, but has now accumulated 98 dan. Jiebankao also basically completed its plan. Jiebankao bought back 51 sheep to solve the shortage of fertilizer. The three villages also completed their plans for fuel preparation, enough to burn for six to eight months, respectively. In terms of transportation side occupations, Chuandi and Jiebankao exceeded their plans, and Xigou completed 80 percent. After this inspection, the team members all believed that this year's winter production exceeded any previous year.

The reasons why the three villages were able to complete the competition plan are: First, they carried out political education on Resist America, Aid Korea, which improved the awareness and production enthusiasm of the farmers. Second, the leading cadres frequently inspected and were able to come up with solutions to difficulties in a timely manner. For example, during the autumn plowing, everyone lacked the confidence to complete the plan due to the rain and wet ground. The leading cadres then led everyone to discuss the benefits of autumn plowing, and came up with the method of plowing sunny slopes and sandy land first, and then plowing shady land, and as a result, the autumn plowing was completed. For example, when preparing fuel, people were unable to go up the mountain to collect firewood due to heavy snow. The leading cadres then organized everyone to engage in transportation production, earning money from transportation to buy coal, and changing from burning firewood to burning coal, which solved the difficulty of fuel. During the three-month competition, Xigou conducted four inspections, and Chuandi and Jiebankao also conducted three inspections. Due to attention to leadership and inspection, the competition was able to move forward step by step. Third, labor models played a leading role. After Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Yang Fengshan, the top labor models in the province, returned from the labor model conference in the province, they immediately convened farmers to hold a meeting to inspect the village's production. When problems were discovered in the competition, they led everyone to study together and come up with solutions, and took the lead in demonstrating, which played a huge role in promoting the competition.

The summary inspection also revealed some shortcomings in the competition, mainly: the development of the competition between mutual aid teams and between households was still uneven, and the role of model mutual aid teams in promoting the entire village was not fully发挥得; the political education of Resist America, Aid Korea was not carried out deeply enough; the mobilization and organization of women to participate in production was done very poorly; the regular inspection system and the reward system have not been well established; the CPC branch, village government, and Youth League cannot cooperate closely in leading production to better发挥组织 their leadership role. Under the leadership of the inspection committee, the leading cadres and labor models of the three villages conducted criticism and self-criticism. Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Yang Fengshan also withdrew part of the bonuses they received when attending the labor model conference in the province, and after democratic discussion, awarded prizes to those who achieved outstanding results in production.

During the summary inspection of the winter production competition, the mutual aid teams in the three villages have undergone rectification. At present, the villages are actively turning to spring plowing production and have formulated specific plans for spring plowing production. In addition to the Li Shunda mutual aid team in Xigou Village proposing to farmers across the country to launch a patriotic production competition to strive for a bumper harvest this year, the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team in Chuandi Village and the Yang Fengshan mutual aid team in Jiebankao Village have once again challenged labor models and farmers throughout Shanxi Province.

### 山西平顺西沟等三个著名模范村  冬季爱国生产竞赛胜利结束

　　山西平顺西沟等三个著名模范村
    冬季爱国生产竞赛胜利结束
    深入进行时事教育、干部经常检查推动、劳动模范带动，是保证竞赛计划胜利完成的原因。
    山西省平顺县西沟、川底、界畔峧三个模范村的冬季爱国主义生产竞赛已胜利结束。三个村的生产竞赛，是在抗美援朝运动中开展起来的。去年十一月间，西沟村李顺达互助组一致提出要以搞好生产的实际行动来进行抗美援朝，并首先向山西全省农民提出开展冬季爱国主义生产竞赛；当即有川底村郭玉恩互助组、界畔峧村杨峰山互助组继起响应。在这三个劳动模范的互助组的影响之下，三个村便展开了竞赛，并联名向全省提出挑战。
    平顺县级领导机关为了进一步开展爱国主义生产运动，全力转向春耕生产，以奠定一九五一年丰产的基础，二月中旬，由该县人民政府、中共平顺县委员会、该县新民主主义青年团、民主妇女联合会各派干部一人加上三个村直属区区长与李顺达等三个劳动模范组成检查评判委员会，对三个村的冬季生产竞赛进行了五天的深入检查。检查的结果，是三个村均已基本上完成并部分超过了计划。如秋耕时三个村原计划普耕一遍，现在除完成计划外，西沟村有百分之六十四的耕地耕过二遍，川底村有百分之三十三耕过二遍。关于肥料的准备，西沟村原计划每亩积肥一○五担，现已积好一一九担（青粪在外）；川底村原计划每亩积肥八八担，现已积好九八担。界畔峧亦基本上完成计划。界畔峧为解决肥料的不足，并买回羊五十一只。燃料的准备，三个村也分别完成了够烧六个月到八个月的计划。在运输副业上，川底、界畔峧超过计划，西沟完成百分之八十。经过这次检查，组员们都认为今年的冬季生产超过了以往任何一年。
    三个村所以能够完成竞赛计划的原因是：第一、进行了抗美援朝的时事教育，提高了农民的觉悟和生产情绪。第二、领导干部经常检查并能及时想出解决困难的办法。如秋耕时因雨多地湿不好耕作，大家都没信心完成计划。领导干部便领导大家讨论秋耕的好处，并想出先犁阳坡地、沙地，后犁背阴地的办法，结果秋耕完成了计划。又如在准备燃料时，因雪大不能上山打柴，领导干部便组织大家从事运输生产，从运输中赚下钱买回煤，把烧柴火改烧煤火，这样就解决了燃料的困难。在三个月的竞赛中，西沟进行过四次检查，川底、界畔峧也都进行过三次检查。由于注意了领导与检查，竞赛才能够一步步地向前发展。第三、劳动模范起带头作用。李顺达、郭玉恩、杨峰山三个全省的头等劳动模范，在省里开过劳动模范会议回来以后，立即召集农民们开会，检查了全村的生产。在竞赛中发现了问题，他们就领导大家共同研究，想出解决的办法，并带头示范，对竞赛起着巨大的推动作用。
    经过总结检查也发现了竞赛中尚存在一些缺点，主要是：竞赛在互助组与互助组之间及户与户之间的发展还不平衡，模范互助组对全村的推动作用还发挥得不够；抗美援朝的时事教育进行得不够深入；发动与组织妇女参加生产还做得很差；经常的检查制度及评奖制度还没有很好建立起来；中共党支部、村政府、青年团在领导生产中还不能做到密切配合以更好地发挥组织领导的作用等。在检查委员会的领导下，三个村的领导干部及劳动模范都进行了批评和自我批评。李顺达、郭玉恩、杨峰山三人并将在省里参加劳动模范会议时所得的奖金抽出一部分，经过民主讨论，对生产中的成绩优异者进行了评奖。
    在总结检查冬季生产竞赛当中，三个村的互助组已经过了整顿。目前，各村正积极转向春耕生产，已订出春耕生产的具体计划。除西沟村李顺达互助组已向全国农民提出开展争取今年丰产的爱国主义生产竞赛而外，川底村的郭玉恩互助组，界畔峧的杨峰山互助组已再次向山西全省劳动模范及全省农民提出挑战。                     （李琳）
