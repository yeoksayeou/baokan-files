　　Beijing Catholic Believers in Education Sector Hold Symposium
    Strengthening Propaganda and Education, Purging Counter-Revolutionaries Among Believers, and Actively Promoting the Self-Reliance and Reform Movement.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Catholic Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression held a symposium on March 25 for Catholic teachers and staff from universities, middle schools, and primary schools across the city. More than 160 Catholic teachers and staff members from over 20 schools, including Fu Jen Catholic University, Guanghua Girls' Middle School, and Zhuxin Primary School, such as Zhang Hanmin, Zhu Fuxiang, Hou Jingyi, and Chen Ruoyu, attended. The participating believers spoke enthusiastically, unanimously advocating assisting the People's Government in resolutely and thoroughly purging counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the Catholic Church, severing all ties with imperialism, and exposing the vicious distortions of the American and Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary bandits regarding the patriotic self-reliance and reform movement of the Catholic Church.
    Liu Fudong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Catholic Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression, said in his speech: We patriotic Catholics must automatically expose counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the Catholic Church; not doing so is not loving the Church, but harming it. Recently, we saw in the newspapers that the People's Government had uncovered a group of special agents and spies using the Catholic Church as a cover, which made everyone feel very ashamed. Only by proactively exposing these counter-revolutionary elements can we consolidate our faith and wash away this disgrace. Subsequently, Zhang Hanmin of Fu Jen Catholic University, Chen Ruoyu, a teacher at Zhuxin Primary School, Zhu Fuxiang, Principal of Guanghua Girls' Middle School, and more than ten others successively expressed their opinions on issues such as launching the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the self-reliance and reform movement, and assisting the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. They all mentioned that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Catholic Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression, the believers felt that this organization was very necessary, and many also felt that the patriotic actions of Catholics in Beijing had fallen behind many other regions. It is necessary to actively and extensively carry out propaganda and education work, help believers with unclear understanding to dispel their concerns, and quickly promote the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement.
    Hou Jingyi, Director of Studies at Peigen Primary School, and Zhang Huai of Fu Jen Catholic University, in their speeches, both explained that today the Chinese people have stood up under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Catholics are Chinese and should love their motherland and can no longer tolerate the destructive activities of imperialism in the Catholic Church. Therefore, self-reliance and reform have become an urgent matter for the Catholic Church. Zhang Hanmin of Fu Jen Catholic University reminded everyone to prevent the conspiracy of imperialism to undermine the self-reliance and reform movement. He said: I once saw a booklet called "The True Meaning of Catholicism," which made distorted interpretations of the self-reliance and reform movement, saying that "'self-support' means that Catholics all over the world donate money to support the Church regardless of nationality, 'self-propagation' means that Catholics propagate the faith themselves, without being restricted by nationality or ethnicity, and 'self-governance' means that Catholics manage church affairs themselves." Our interpretation of the self-reliance and reform movement is: "Self-support" means that Chinese Catholics support the Church themselves, "self-propagation" means that Chinese Catholics propagate the faith themselves, and "self-governance" means that Chinese Catholics manage church affairs themselves. Undoubtedly, the latter is the correct explanation of the Three-Self Reform Movement, while the former is the claim of imperialist elements attempting to undermine the Three-Self Reform Movement. Hou Jingyi continued: As long as imperialism exists, we must be vigilant to prevent it from taking advantage of loopholes. When Zhu Fuxiang talked about suppressing counter-revolutionaries, he specifically stated that Catholics advocate universal love; but we do not talk about universal love for American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits who wear human skin and harm the people, but rather we must resolutely and thoroughly cleanse them from the church. Li Leguang, Secretary-General of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression, was invited to speak. He said that the central issue of the Catholic patriotic movement is to actively carry out the self-reliance and reform movement, resolutely sever ties with imperialism, eliminate the influence of imperialism on the Catholic Church, and remove those destructive elements who use the Catholic Church to endanger our country.
    Chairman Liu Fudong concluded by saying that he hoped that all Catholic believers in the city, especially the educators attending the symposium, would bravely undertake this glorious task and achieve results in a short period of time.

　　北京市教育界天主教徒举行座谈会
    将加强宣传教育工作，肃清教徒中的反革命分子，积极推行自立革新运动。
    【本报讯】北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会筹备会于三月二十五日召开全市大、中、小学天主教教友座谈会，到有辅仁大学、光华女子中学和铸新小学等二十多个学校的教职员工教友张汉民、祝福祥、侯景毅、陈若愚等一百六十余人。与会教友纷纷发言，一致主张协助人民政府坚决彻底肃清隐藏在天主教中的反革命分子，斩断与帝国主义的一切联系，并揭穿了美、蒋反革命匪徒对天主教爱国自立革新运动的恶毒曲解。
    北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会筹备会主席刘福栋在致词中说：我们爱国的天主教徒一定要自动检举隐藏在天主教中的反革命分子；若不这样作，就不是爱教，而是害教。最近在报纸上，我们看见人民政府破获了一批借天主教作掩护的特务间谍案件，大家的脸上都很不光彩。天主教徒只有主动地把这些反革命分子检举出来，才能巩固我们的信仰，才能洗刷掉这一耻辱。接着辅仁大学张汉民、铸新小学教员陈若愚、光华女中校长祝福祥等十余人相继对展开抗美援朝运动、自立革新运动和协助人民政府镇压反革命等问题发表了意见。他们都提到，北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会筹备会成立后，教友们都认为这个组织是十分必要的，许多人还觉得北京市天主教徒的爱国行动已经落在许多别的地区的后面，必须积极地广泛地进行宣传教育工作，帮助认识不清的教友解除顾虑，迅速地把抗美援朝爱国运动推动起来。
    培根小学教导主任侯景毅和辅仁大学张怀的发言中，都说明今天中国人民在毛主席领导下已经站起来了，天主教徒是中国人，就应热爱自己的祖国，不能再容忍帝国主义在天主教中的破坏活动。因此自立革新就成为天主教当前迫不容缓的事情。辅仁大学张汉民提醒大家，要防止帝国主义企图破坏自立革新运动的阴谋。他说：我曾经看见一本叫《天主教真义》的小册子，对自立革新运动作了歪曲的解释，说什么“‘自养’是全世界的教徒不分国籍共同捐钱养教，‘自传’是教徒自己传教，不受国籍或民族的限制，‘自治’是教徒自己管理教务。”而我们对自立革新运动的解释是：“自养”是中国教徒自己养教，“自传”是中国教徒自己传教，“自治”是中国教徒自己管理教务。无疑的，后一种才是三自革新运动的正确解释，前一种是帝国主义分子企图破坏三自革新运动的说法。侯景毅接着说：帝国主义存在一天，我们就要提高警惕，防止它来钻空子。祝福祥在谈到镇压反革命的时候，特别说明天主教徒是讲博爱的；但对于披着人皮残害人民的美蒋匪徒并不讲博爱，而是要坚决彻底地把他们从教会中清洗出去。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京市分会李乐光秘书长应邀讲话。他说天主教爱国运动的中心问题是积极进行自立革新运动，坚决斩断与帝国主义的联系，肃清帝国主义对天主教的影响，要把那些利用天主教来危害我们国家的破坏分子清除出去。
    主席刘福栋最后发言，他希望全市的天主教友，特别是出席座谈会的教育界的教友，要勇敢地承担起这一光荣任务，并在短时间内作出成绩。
