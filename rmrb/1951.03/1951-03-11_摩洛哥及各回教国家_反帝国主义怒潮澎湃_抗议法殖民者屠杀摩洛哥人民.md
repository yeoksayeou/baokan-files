Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch:

　　The French colonialists' bloody offensive against the Moroccan people, who are demanding national independence, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, has sparked a surging anti-imperialist wave in Morocco and various Islamic countries.

　　On the 2nd, six thousand people in the Ksibah region of Morocco demonstrated in front of the local French administrative office, and the Arab soldiers sent to disperse the demonstrators refused to fire on them. Similar demonstrations were also held in southern Morocco.

　　The nationwide movement in Egypt to support Morocco's struggle for national independence is expanding. On the 4th, students in Cairo and Alexandria again marched in procession and warned the French government that they would sever cultural and economic ties with France. At the same time, the board of directors of Al-Azhar University also declared that it would call on all Arabs and Muslims around the world to boycott French goods.

　　Pakistan's "World Islamic Youth Organization" called for the organization of volunteer troops to participate in the Moroccan people's struggle. Students and young people in Lahore held large-scale demonstrations continuously on the 5th and 6th, chanting "Down with French imperialism backed by the United States! Down with the Anglo-American bloc!" The leading writers of fourteen important newspapers in Pakistan also jointly issued a statement, denouncing Truman for forcibly establishing military bases in other countries by bloody means.

　　Students in Syria and Lebanon also held similar demonstrations. The Iraqi National Association of Journalists sent a telegram to the Arab League, requesting it to "call on all countries to support Morocco's struggle for freedom."

　　Amid the widespread public outrage, the ruling groups of various Islamic countries also expressed sympathy for Morocco's nationalist movement. The Arab League Political Committee is scheduled to meet on the 10th to discuss the Moroccan issue, and Al-Fassi, Secretary-General of the Moroccan Independence Party (formerly the Istiqlal Party), will attend to testify. Egyptian Foreign Minister Salahuddin believes that the Moroccan incident "will represent one country carrying out armed aggression against another." The Syrian Parliament and two members of the Iranian Parliament have fiercely criticized the bloody crimes of the French colonialists. An Indonesian official spokesman also stated that Indonesia sympathizes with Morocco's independence movement.

　　摩洛哥及各回教国家
    反帝国主义怒潮澎湃
    抗议法殖民者屠杀摩洛哥人民
    【新华社十日讯】法国殖民主义者在美帝国主义指使下对要求民族独立的摩洛哥人民发动血腥进攻一事，已在摩洛哥及各回教国家激起了澎湃的反帝国主义怒潮。
    二日，摩洛哥克西巴地方有六千人在当地法国行政公署前面示威，被派去驱散示威群众的阿拉伯士兵都拒绝向示威者开枪。摩洛哥南部也举行了同样的示威。
    埃及全国支援摩洛哥争取民族独立的运动正在扩大中。四日，开罗和亚历山大的学生们又列队游行，并警告法国政府：将与法国断绝文化上和经济上的关系。同时，阿尔柴哈大学的董事会也声称：将号召全世界阿拉伯人和回教徒抵制法国货。
    巴基斯坦的“世界回教青年组织”号召组织志愿军，参加摩洛哥人民的斗争。拉合尔的学生和青年在五、六两日连续举行大示威，高呼“打倒由美国撑腰的法帝国主义！打倒美英集团！”巴基斯坦十四种重要报纸的主笔也联合发表声明，痛斥杜鲁门用血腥手段在别国强行建立军事基地。
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩的学生也举行了同样的示威。伊拉克全国记者协会致电阿拉伯联盟，要求“号召各国支持摩洛哥争取自由的斗争”。
    在群情沸腾下，各回教国家的统治集团对摩洛哥的民族主义运动也表示同情。阿拉伯联盟政治委员会将定于十日开会讨论摩洛哥问题，摩洛哥独立党（前译伊斯提格拉尔党）总书记法席将出席作证。埃及外交部长赛拉哈丁认为摩洛哥事件“将表示一个国家对另一国家实行武装侵略”。叙利亚议会和伊朗的两个议员都猛烈抨击法国殖民主义者的血腥罪行。印尼官方发言人也表示：印尼同情摩洛哥的独立运动。
