Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th Dispatch, TASS reports: The German News Agency reported: On March 20th, Norden, the head of the press office of the German Democratic Republic's News Bureau, held a press conference in Berlin regarding the signing of the "Schuman Plan." Norden pointed out at the meeting: The Schuman Plan is nothing more than a conspiracy by the former masters of the European cartels under the manipulation of the United States. The "Schuman Plan" exacerbates the dismemberment of Germany. This is a plan that violates the Potsdam Agreement because it allows the former arms magnates of the Ruhr steel industry to once again seize a considerable portion of the Ruhr's mines. This is a plan to betray the motherland because it deprives Germans of the possibility of using the resources of the economic heart of Europe themselves, while other countries, first and foremost the United States, the behind-the-scenes manipulator who approved this plan, become the true masters of the Ruhr. These Ruhr arms magnates, together with a small group of German traitors, have become America's economic constables in Europe. This alliance of steel industry tycoons will only bring suffering to the German people.

Norden continued: The Bonn "government" has announced that the annual occupation fees will be increased to nine billion West Marks. This means that every worker in West Germany must work three months this year to maintain the occupying forces. At the same time, the re-militarization of West Germany is proceeding with all its might.

Norden concluded: The German people, especially the German youth, are unwilling to die for American interests now or in the future, and they will fight for peace and friendship among all peoples.

　　民主德国新闻处处长
    斥“舒曼计划”为非法       
    它违反波茨坦协定及人民的利益
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：德意志通讯社报道：三月二十日，德意志民主共和国新闻局新闻处处长诺登就“舒曼计划”签字一事在柏林举行记者招待会。诺登在会上指出：舒曼计划不过是以前欧洲卡特尔的主人在美国操纵下的阴谋而已。“舒曼计划”加剧了德国的肢解。这是一个违反波茨坦协定的计划，因为它允许过去鲁尔区钢铁工业中的军火大王再度把相当大的一部分鲁尔区的矿山据为己有。这是出卖祖国的计划，因为它剥夺了德国人自己使用欧洲经济心脏的富源的可能性，而其他的国家，首先是批准这个计划的幕后操纵者美国，却成为鲁尔的真正主人。这些鲁尔的军火大王们与一小撮德国卖国贼集团一道成为美国在欧洲的经济宪兵。这一钢铁工业大亨们的联盟只会给德国人民带来苦难。
    诺登继称：波恩“政府”已宣布每年的占领费将增加到九十亿西马克。这就是说，西德的每一个工人今年必须工作三个月以维持占领军。与此同时，西德的重新军国主义化工作正在全力进行中。
    诺登最后说：德国人民特别是德国青年现在或将来都不愿为美国的利益而死，他们将为和平与各国人民之间的友好而斗争。
