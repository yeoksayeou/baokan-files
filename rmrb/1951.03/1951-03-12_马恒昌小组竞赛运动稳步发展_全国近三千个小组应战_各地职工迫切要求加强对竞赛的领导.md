　　Ma Hengchang Group Competition Movement Steadily Develops
    Nearly Three Thousand Groups Nationwide Respond to the Challenge
    Workers in Various Regions Urgently Request Strengthened Leadership of the Competition
    [Our Newspaper] The Ma Hengchang group competition movement is developing steadily. Nearly three thousand groups across the country have responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group. Among them, more than 1,500 are in North China, 382 in Northeast China, more than 280 in Central and South China, and nearly 900 in East China, Northwest China, and Southwest China.
    At present, the movement has expanded from large cities to medium and small cities. The participating enterprises have expanded from industries such as machinery, railways, iron and steel, and electricity to departments such as forestry and trade. Not only direct production workers but also technicians, clerks, teachers, logistics staff, and others have participated in the competition.
    In this competition, most of the trade unions in various regions have been able to actively organize and help the production groups to formulate conditions to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group. Trade union organizations in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places have successively held meetings of production department heads or cadres above the level of grassroots trade union group leaders, joint meetings of industrial trade union committees and local trade union committees, etc., to mobilize workers to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group and discuss specific methods of competition. The Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions once notified its subordinate grassroots trade unions to generally learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group and conducted tests on cadres above the level of trade union group leaders. With the help of the trade union, the Dai Kedu group of Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the Production Technology Section group of Shijingshan Power Plant, and others have revised the unrealistic and empty challenge conditions.
    Workers in various regions have actively learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group in response to the challenge, and have achieved initial results. Qian Dazhen's leather trimming group of Wuhan Leather Factory learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group, reallocated manpower, and implemented division of labor and responsibility, so that the daily output per person increased by more than 50% compared with the past. After this method was promoted to various groups, the production of each group generally increased by more than 50%. The Nie Yinchang group of Beijing Telephone Bureau No. 2 learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group, conducted a comprehensive inspection of the machines, established a technical study meeting three times a week, and formulated an inspection system for the machine operation every hour, so that the machine efficiency has approached 100%.
    With the development of the movement, workers in various regions are now urgently requesting that the Party and administrative departments pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the movement, conduct thorough education, and be able to develop the movement persistently under the leadership of the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（Qiao Yuzhou）

　　马恒昌小组竞赛运动稳步发展
    全国近三千个小组应战
    各地职工迫切要求加强对竞赛的领导
    【本报讯】马恒昌小组竞赛运动在稳步发展中。全国各地已有近三千个小组向马恒昌小组应战。其中华北一千五百多个、东北三百八十二个、中南二百八十余个、华东、西北、西南等地近九百个。
    目前运动已由大城市扩展至中、小城市。参加竞赛的企业已由机器、铁路、钢铁、电业等产业扩展至森林、贸易等部门。不仅是直接生产的工人，而且技术人员、职员、教员、勤务员等也参加了竞赛。
    各地工会在这次竞赛中，大多能积极组织和帮助各生产小组制订条件向马恒昌小组应战。北京、张家口、上海、武汉、广州等地工会组织更先后召开生产部长会议或基层工会小组长以上的干部会、产业工会委员会与地方工会委员会的联席会议等，动员职工向马恒昌小组应战和研讨竞赛的具体办法。张家口市总工会曾通知所属基层工会普遍学习马恒昌小组经验，并对工会小组长以上的干部进行测验。在工会的帮助下，上海国营第二棉纺织厂戴可都小组、石景山发电厂生产技术科小组等均曾修改了不合实际和空泛的应战条件。
    各地职工在应战中积极地学习马恒昌小组经验，并已有了初步成绩。武汉皮革厂钱达真划面皮小组工友学习马恒昌小组经验，重新调配人力，实行分工专责等办法，使每人每天产量比过去提高了百分之五十以上。这一办法推广到各组后，各组生产也普遍提高了百分之五十以上。北京市电话二局聂荫昌组学习马恒昌小组经验，将机器进行了全面大检查，建立了每星期三次的技术学习会，制订了每小时机器运转情况的检查制度，使机器效率已接近百分之百。
    随着运动的发展，目前各地职工迫切要求党和行政方面注意加强对运动的领导，进行充分的教育，并能够在党、行政和工会组织配合下有领导地将运动持久地发展下去。          （乔雨舟）
