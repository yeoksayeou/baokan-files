World Peace Preservation Movement Fortnight
    A New Stage in the Peace Preservation Movement
    The declaration and resolutions of the First Session of the World Peace Council have been unanimously endorsed and enthusiastically supported by peace-loving people all over the world. China's various democratic parties and people's organizations have issued statements expressing their warm support. This association has issued a circular calling on the people of the whole country to respond to the resolutions of the World Peace Council and to promote and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea throughout the country.
    The people of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European people's democracies warmly support the declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Council. The Soviet newspaper Pravda commented that the peace-loving people of all countries will regard the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact and other resolutions as expressions of their hopes and will. The Polish newspaper People's Tribune pointed out that if the people of the world follow Stalin's instructions, take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend it to the end, the heroic struggle to preserve peace will surely be victorious.
    The resolutions of the Peace Council have also been endorsed by the people of capitalist countries. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party called on the entire party to do everything possible to quickly make the broad masses of the French people aware of this declaration, so as to carry out extensive activities for the cause of peace and to strive for the convening of a five-power conference conducive to easing international tensions. The Swedish Peace Preservation Congress held in Stockholm adopted eight peace proposals, including advocating a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, holding negotiations on resolving all Far Eastern conflicts, and convening a five-power conference to conclude a peace pact. It also passed a resolution to launch a signature campaign for the conclusion of a peace pact throughout the country. In India, the preparatory committee meeting of the Second All-India Peace Congress has decided to collect signatures in India for the conclusion of a peace pact. In Italy, the demonstration movement for peace is booming: the Italian National Youth Federation has decided to hold a "Youth Day for Peace Preservation" throughout Italy on March 18 to promote the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact; Massa Topo in Bologna province held a demonstration on March 4 to commemorate International Working Women's Day, protesting against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, and demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.
    In addition, the International Student Union has called on students around the world to sign the Peace Council declaration.
  The Soviet Union Passes Peace Preservation Law
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union and the Nationalities held a joint meeting on March 12 and, based on the proposal of the World Peace Council, unanimously passed the Peace Preservation Law. Stalin, the helmsman of the world peace cause, attended the meeting in person and was warmly cheered by all the representatives and guests.
    The Peace Preservation Law passed by the Soviet Supreme Soviet stipulates that: (1) Any form of war propaganda should be regarded as undermining the cause of peace and creating the threat of a new war, and is therefore the most serious crime against humanity; (2) Anyone who commits the crime of war propaganda should be handed over to the court and tried as a heinous criminal.
    The passage of the Peace Preservation Law by the Soviet Supreme Soviet is another proof of the Soviet people's commitment to the cause of peace and a serious blow to the imperialist war propagandists.
  Japanese People Firmly Oppose Rearmament
    The majority of the Japanese people oppose rearmament and advocate overall reconciliation. In the responses received by the Japanese progressive newspaper "Power of Peace," including workers, housewives, teachers, and merchants, more than 95% were in favor of overall reconciliation, and more than 97% were opposed to rearmament and providing military bases. Other opinion polls also yielded roughly the same results.
    In order to strive for a united front for overall reconciliation, the various opposition parties in Japan are developing rapidly throughout the country. Many wards in Tokyo, including the Socialist Party, the National Democratic Party, and trade unions, have expressed their acceptance of the Japanese Communist Party's call to jointly launch a movement for overall reconciliation. The conspiracy of American imperialism to accelerate the arming of Japan through unilateral reconciliation is facing increasing resistance.
  West German People Demand a Referendum
    The West German people's struggle against rearmament is currently focused on holding a referendum. This struggle has been given centralized leadership by the establishment of the preparatory committee of the "Central Committee Against Remilitarization." People from many regions of West Germany have sent representatives to participate in this preparatory work. The Central Preparatory Committee met in Dusseldorf on February 15 and discussed taking measures to hold a national referendum on the issue of West German remilitarization. Recently, a protest meeting of more than 1,000 people was held in Munich, and many people signed the following declaration: "I declare that I oppose and will always oppose the remilitarization of Germany, because I believe that it will lead to the destruction of our entire nation. Remilitarization must be a matter to be resolved by a referendum."
    The German people's love of peace and opposition to the rearmament of West Germany is also reflected in the resolution of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic demanding that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Proclamation. On March 2, the People's Chamber unanimously resolved to recommend to the "Bonn Federal Parliament" that they jointly submit a joint proposal to the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of concluding a peace treaty, requesting that it be based on the following points: eradicating militarism; democratically revitalizing Germany; restoring German unity; guaranteeing free trade and the free development of peaceful production; and withdrawing the occupying forces of various countries one year after the signing of the peace treaty. This proposal has been warmly endorsed by the broad masses of the West German people, but the "Bonn Federal Parliament," as in the past, avoids responding and dares not face this proposal unanimously supported by the entire German people. At the meeting of the Assistant Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Four Powers held in Paris on March 5, the Soviet representative read out this request on behalf of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and other national organizations in Germany.

　　世界保卫和平运动半月
    保卫和平运动的新阶段
    世界和平理事会第一届会议的宣言和各项决议，已获得全世界爱好和平人民的一致拥护与热烈支持。中国各民主党派和人民团体都已发表声明表示热烈拥护，本会已发表通告，号召全国人民响应世界和平理事会决议，并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家的人民热烈拥护世界和平理事会的宣言和决议。苏联真理报发表评论说：各国爱好和平的人民将把世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言和其他决议，看作他们的希望与意志的表现。波兰人民论坛报指出：如果全世界人民都遵照斯大林的指示，将维护和平的事业担当起来并将它保卫到底，保卫和平的英雄斗争一定会取得胜利。
    和平理事会的决议也获得资本主义国家人民的拥护。法国共产党政治局号召全党尽一切努力迅速使法国广大群众认识这个宣言，从而为和平事业进行广泛活动，为争取召开有助于缓和国际紧张局势的五大国代表会议而奋斗。在斯德哥尔摩举行的瑞典保卫和平大会，通过了主张和平解决朝鲜问题、举行关于解决远东全部冲突的谈判和召开五大国会议缔结和平公约等八项和平建议，并通过决议在全国发动缔结和平公约的签名运动。在印度，第二届全印和平大会筹备委员会会议已决定在印度为缔结和平公约征集签名。在意大利，争取和平的示威运动正在蓬勃发展：意大利全国青年联合会决定于三月十八日在意大利全境举行“青年保卫和平日”，来宣传缔结和平公约的宣言；波伦亚省马萨托波于三月四日举行了纪念国际劳动妇女节的示威游行，抗议武装西德和日本，要求缔结五大国和平公约。
    此外，国际学生联合会已号召全世界的学生在和平理事会宣言上签名。
  苏联通过保卫和平法案
    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院与民族院于三月十二日举行联席会议，根据世界和平理事会的提议，一致通过了保卫和平法案。世界和平事业的舵手斯大林曾亲临参加，受到全体代表与来宾的热烈欢呼。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议通过的保卫和平法案中规定：（一）不论是任何形式的战争宣传，都应视为破坏和平事业、制造新战争威胁，因而是危害人类的最严重的罪行；（二）凡犯宣传战争罪行者应交付法庭，作为罪大恶极的罪犯加以审讯。
    苏联最高苏维埃通过保卫和平法案，是苏联人民致力于和平事业的又一证明，是对帝国主义战争宣传者的严重打击。
  日本人民坚决反对重新武装
    日本大多数人民都反对重新武装，主张全面媾和。日本进步报纸“和平之力”所收到的包括工人、家庭主妇、教员以及商人测验的答复中，赞成全面媾和者在百分之九十五以上，反对重新武装与反对提供军事基地者均占百分之九十七以上。其他民意调查结果也大致与此相同。
    日本各在野党派为争取全面媾和的统一战线，正在日本各地迅速发展。东京市内许多区的社会党、国民民主党及工会都表示接受日本共产党提出的共同展开全面媾和运动的号召。美帝国主义企图以片面缔和来加速武装日本的阴谋正遭到日益增大的阻力。
  西德人民要求实行人民投票
    西德人民反对重新武装的斗争，目前正集中在举行人民投票上。这一斗争方式已因“反对重新军国主义化中央委员会”筹备委员会的建立而有了集中的领导。西德许多地区的人民都选派了代表参加这一筹备工作。二月十五日在杜塞尔多夫中央筹备委员会开会，已经讨论了采取措施在全国就西德重新军国主义化问题举行人民投票的问题。最近，在慕尼黑举行了一千余人的抗议大会，许多人都在下面这个宣言上签了名。这个宣言说：“我声明，我反对而且必将始终反对德国重新军国主义化，因为我认为，那会使我们全体国民遭到毁灭。重新军国主义化必须成为由人民投票来解决的问题。”
    德国人民爱好和平、反对重新武装西德的意志，同时也反映在德意志人民共和国人民议会要求苏、美、英、法四国按照波茨坦公告的原则早日缔结和约的决议上。在三月二日，人民议会曾一致决议向“波恩联邦议会”建议共同向苏、美、英、法四国就缔订和约问题提出共同建议，要求以下列各点为基础：肃清军国主义；民主复兴德国；恢复德国的统一；保证自由贸易及和平生产的自由发展；在和约签订一年以后撤退各国占领军。这一建议已获得西德广大人民的热烈拥护，而“波恩联邦议会”和以往情形一样避不作复，不敢正视这个为全德人民一致赞成的建议。三月五日在巴黎召开的四国外长会议助理会议中，苏联代表已代德国人民议会及德国其他全国性组织宣读了这一要求。
