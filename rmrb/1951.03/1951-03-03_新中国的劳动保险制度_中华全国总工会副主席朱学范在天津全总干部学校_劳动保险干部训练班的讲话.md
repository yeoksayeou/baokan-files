    The Labor Insurance System of New China
    Speech by Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at the Labor Insurance Cadre Training Class of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School in Tianjin
    (December 10, 1950)

            The Fruits of Revolutionary Victory

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the draft of the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" on October 29th, widely soliciting opinions from all parties, and preparing to revise and implement it after approval. The promulgation and implementation of this regulation are unprecedented in the history of Chinese labor legislation and represent the great victory of the Chinese working class under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. As early as twenty-eight years ago, in 1922, the Chinese Labor Union Secretariat, led by the Chinese Communist Party, began its continuous and heroic struggle to improve the lives of the working class, with labor insurance as an important goal of the labor legislation movement. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has established its own national power and promulgated the draft of the Labor Insurance Regulations to protect the health of workers and staff and to alleviate their special difficulties and concerns in life. Only the people's regime under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can enact this worker protection law for our working class. This is something we should all warmly celebrate.

    Today, China is a people's democratic state led by the working class. The Chinese working class is already the master of the country and society. Chairman Mao pointed out that the basic principle of economic policy is also the basic principle of labor policy: "Develop production, prosper the economy, take into consideration both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." It is to achieve the goal of "developing production and prospering the economy" by means of "taking into consideration both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital." Therefore, in state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to take into account the interests of the "public," that is, the interests of the state; at the same time, it is also necessary to take into account the interests of the "private," that is, individual interests. In private enterprises, the interests of both workers and capitalists should be taken into account. In the old society of China for thousands of years, the interests of the working class were never taken into account. The ruling class only took care of the bureaucratic capitalist state-owned enterprises, the so-called "public" interests, and the so-called "private" interests of private capitalists. Workers were slaves, beasts of burden, and were not treated as human beings at all. How could they get the benefits they deserved? Today, our working class has its own government, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have grasped the truth of Marxism-Leninism—that labor creates the world. Only the working people are the most worthy of respect and attention. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the cadre meeting celebrating May Day in Beijing this year: "...The human world and even humanity itself were created through labor. Labor is the foundation upon which human society survives and develops, and laborers are the creators of civilization. Therefore, labor should become the most respected thing in the world, and laborers should become the most respected people." The Sixth National Labor Congress in 1948 passed a resolution: "In cities with concentrated factories or where conditions permit, labor social insurance can be established." Article 32 of the Common Program passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year clearly stipulated "gradually implement the labor insurance system." The basic principles of labor policy put forward by Chairman Mao have become the guiding principles of the labor policy of the Central People's Government. The implementation of the labor insurance regulations on a national scale is a concrete manifestation of Chairman Mao's labor policy.

            Changing the Exploitation System of "Valuing Machines, Not People"

    In the past, due to the consequences of the exploitation system of "valuing machines, not people" in Chinese society for thousands of years, disasters and accidents in industrial and mining enterprises and the illness and death of workers were very serious. During the Japanese occupation of Northeast China, more than 3,000 people were killed in an explosion at the Fushun Coal Mine, and the well-known Hegang Coal Mine also had a "ten-thousand-people pit." The reactionaries never paid attention to this issue. Now, standing on the truth that we value people and that labor creates the world, we feel that it is very serious. The current situation is very different from the past, but it is still very serious. Last year, from January to May in Northeast China, an average of 0.29 people died for every 10,000 tons of coal produced, meaning that one person died and 14 were injured for every 30,000 tons of coal produced. In North China, from January to August last year, 0.49 people died for every 10,000 tons of coal produced, meaning that one person died and 25 were injured for every 20,000 tons of coal produced. This is the evil consequence of the lack of safety and hygiene equipment and the old society's "valuing machines, not people." This evil consequence left over from the old society cannot be changed overnight. Therefore, disasters and accidents in industrial and mining enterprises, as well as the illness, death, injury, and disability of workers, have become special difficulties and concerns of the working class.

    The draft of the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government this time will play a great positive role in protecting the health of workers and alleviating their special difficulties and concerns in life. After the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations in Northeast China, 630,000 workers and staff and their families, totaling about 1.5 million people, enjoyed the benefits of labor insurance. From April to October 1949, in seven months, 55,204 people in the five major state-owned enterprises of railways, mines, textiles, post and telecommunications, and electricity received labor insurance benefits. This shows that there are various special difficulties and concerns such as birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability among the working class. Now, the draft of the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the Government Administration Council of our Central People's Government can provide basic security to workers and staff when they temporarily or permanently lose their labor power. The state law stipulates that enterprise administrations or capitalists allocate labor insurance funds to workers and staff, providing necessary material subsidies and other labor insurance benefits, so as to protect the health of workers and staff in public and private enterprises and alleviate special difficulties, improve production, increase wealth, accelerate the restoration and development of the national economy, and gradually improve the material conditions of workers and staff and the national people, so that all working people can live a happy life. This is the purpose of implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations.

    In the past, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Chinese working class had almost no way to solve unfortunate accidents such as illness, death, injury, and disability. Under the rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, the suffering of the working class in life would not be cared about by capitalists. What capitalists cared most about was "machines," not "people." They regarded machinery and equipment, raw materials, and equipment as more important and valuable than workers and staff. When workers encountered illness, etc., the capitalists' method was to deduct wages for leave or simply dismiss them. In case of injury or death, they would look for charitable organizations such as the "Red Cross" or "Pushan Villa." Even if they wanted the capitalists to take out some money, they had to beg them. They did good deeds in the capacity of philanthropists. This is called the charitable cause of great philanthropists. The working class was brutally oppressed and exploited by them, and directly or indirectly harmed, and these murderers were called great philanthropists. What truth is there? What right and wrong are there?

            Labor Insurance in Capitalist Countries is a Means of Ruling Workers

    The Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to ease the struggle of the working class and divide the strength of the working class. They had to make concessions to the workers in some enterprises, such as foreign-funded enterprises and postal and telecommunications enterprises. However, the partial subsidy measures similar to labor insurance that the workers in these enterprises fought for were very chaotic, unfair, and unreasonable. For example, mental laborers were higher than manual laborers, and male workers were more than female workers, in an attempt to cause division within the working class and make them forever succumb to their rule. Another more unreasonable thing is that the insurance premiums are not borne by the enterprise, but deducted from the workers' wages. For example, the pseudo-Resources Committee deducted 0.5% of the wages of workers and staff. This is a copy of the old methods of capitalist countries: "Workers pay, capitalists pretend."

    In capitalist countries, most of the insurance premiums are borne by the workers and staff themselves. In fact, it is a disguised additional tax, which becomes a tool for exploiting workers. Workers pay a lot of money, but the subsidies and pensions they receive are very small. For example, American workers paid more than 4.3 billion US dollars from 1938 to 1942, while the old-age insurance money received by workers was less than 800 million US dollars, but it supported a large number of bureaucratic agency staff. When I was in the United States, I saw with my own eyes that the expenses of their labor insurance agency were about one-third of the insurance money. The collective undertakings they held were not prepared for the workers. There was a sanatorium near New York. When I was there, the person in charge of the sanatorium promoted to me how cheap and perfect it was, and it was completely for the service of the workers. I stayed there for two days. As a result, I was issued an invoice for thirty US dollars. Where is such a large expense set up to serve the workers? It is entirely set up to exploit the workers. How can workers afford to live there? Therefore, it can be said that workers cannot get the real benefits of labor insurance. In fact, it is using the workers' money to hire some lackeys to serve the capitalists, which is used to control and exploit the working class. This method is the most vicious and insidious.

    The social insurance of general capitalist countries is incomplete. Before World War II, 41 countries had no old-age insurance, 49 countries had no sickness insurance, and 53 countries had no disability insurance. The purpose of capitalist countries in running social insurance is not to solve the special difficulties of the working class, but to attempt to paralyze and eliminate the fighting spirit of the working class in order to maintain the ruling order of the exploiting class. They are fundamentally different in nature from the labor insurance of our people's democratic countries.

            The Soviet Union's Social Insurance System is the Most Advanced in the World

    The social insurance system of the socialist Soviet Union is the most advanced and perfect system in the world. All working people in the Soviet Union can enjoy the right to social insurance benefits, guaranteeing all workers and staff that they do not have to worry about accidents such as illness, disability, and old age. In the Soviet Union, it is very pleasant to see working people working in mines and factories. The accidents that occur in their mines and factories have been reduced a lot, and at the same time, there is the most perfect insurance system in the world. Birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability are no longer matters of concern in their minds. What they have to worry about is how to work hard to produce, complete tasks, and strive to be labor models; at the same time, when planning their holidays, they accompany their partners to the sanatorium on the Black Sea? Or to the sanatorium in the suburbs of Moscow? These are impossible for capitalist countries to do. In the UK, they have so-called unemployment insurance. Is there insurance when you lose your job? However, every worker is worried about unemployment. Why is that? Because the unemployment insurance relief is very small, only 25% of the wage, and the wage is reduced by 75%. Therefore, although there is unemployment insurance, they are worried about unemployment. The Soviet Union has never had the phenomenon of unemployment, so there is no need to worry about unemployment. All insurance expenses of the Soviet social insurance system are entirely borne by the state. In 1949, the Soviet Union had 11 billion rubles for social insurance, which became one of the main factors in improving the material and cultural life of the working class. This is the fruit of the great victory of the October Revolution, which is fundamentally different from any capitalist insurance system.

            The Labor Insurance System of New China is Essentially the Same as the Soviet Social Insurance System

    The draft of the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by our New China marks the beginning of the Chinese labor insurance system. Although the Chinese labor insurance system is not yet as perfect as the Soviet social insurance system, it will definitely move towards the path of the Soviet social insurance system in the future. The Chinese labor insurance system will definitely develop into the same as the Soviet social insurance system now. Therefore, our Chinese labor insurance system is essentially the same in spirit as the Soviet social insurance system; while it is the opposite of the social insurance system of capitalist countries.

    Now I would like to talk about the characteristics of this draft of the Labor Insurance Regulations:

    The first feature is that it starts from the actual needs of the workers and sincerely solves the special difficulties encountered in the lives of the working class, not like the social insurance system of capitalist countries, which starts from a trading point of view and treats workers in a bargaining manner, how much money is given for a lost hand, and how much money is given for a dead person. Our labor insurance regulations of the new democratic country are not for anything else, but entirely for the interests of the working class, to protect the health of workers, alleviate their special difficulties in life, and relieve their worries. If they are sick, they will be treated, and if they are old, they will be provided for. The difficulties encountered in the lives of the working class will be completely solved with a responsible attitude.

    The second feature is that all expenses of labor insurance are entirely borne by the enterprise administration or the capitalist. Public enterprises are allocated by the enterprise administration, and private enterprises are allocated by the capitalist in the enterprise. No insurance expenses shall be collected from the workers again. The working class in capitalist countries cannot enjoy such benefits.

    The third feature is that our Chinese labor insurance is initially in the hands of the working class itself, and the labor insurance affairs are implemented by the trade union organizations of the working class itself. The trade union is the most able to understand the needs of the workers. Only when the trade union is in charge of the implementation of this matter can it be fair and reasonable. This is completely different from the insurance system of capitalist countries. The bureaucratic agencies that handle social insurance in capitalist countries have spent a lot of insurance money and raised a group of lackeys who specialize in controlling and exploiting workers, and have not used all the insurance money for the cause of worker insurance. Our insurance money is not used for administrative expenses for business execution, but is entirely used for workers and staff.

    The fourth feature is that our labor insurance includes various insurances such as childbirth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability, and comprehensively takes care of the special difficulties that may occur in the lives of workers, and also holds various collective labor insurance undertakings such as sanatoriums, convalescent homes, disability homes, nursing homes, and orphan nurseries. The social insurance of capitalist countries is partial and sporadic, while our labor insurance is comprehensive, collective, and fundamental.

    The fifth feature is that our labor insurance can give special and excellent labor insurance benefits to labor models who have made special contributions to their work and combat heroes and disabled soldiers who have transferred to enterprises. This is a new morality in our new society to show respect for those who have made special contributions to serving the people and the people's revolutionary cause of production and construction.

    The sixth feature is that our labor insurance treats trade union members and non-members differently, because in a new democratic society, people are encouraged to organize themselves, and trade unions are a powerful pillar of the state power. In order to encourage those workers and staff with relatively backward thinking to actively participate in trade unions, so as to strengthen the strength of the trade union organization, this regulation is appropriate.

    The seventh feature is that our regulations have played a positive role in promoting the improvement of labor protection work. We know that labor insurance and labor protection are closely related. In addition to the 3% of labor insurance funds, such as medical treatment for illnesses and wages during the short-term treatment period, they are all borne by the enterprise administration or the capitalist, and are not included in the 3% labor insurance funds. If the labor protection, safety, and hygiene equipment of the enterprise administration or the capitalist is not good, it will be of great hindrance to the health of the workers, and the rate of illness and death will be high, and the enterprise administration or the capitalist will bear more. In order to reduce the burden of labor insurance expenses, the enterprise administration or the capitalist must pay attention to labor protection work. Therefore, in addition to the 3% insurance money, the regulations stipulate that the enterprise administration and the capitalist bear the expenses for holidays and medical care. Therefore, in order to reduce this expenditure, the enterprise administration and the capitalist must first pay attention to labor protection matters. Therefore, this labor insurance regulation has become a positive factor in promoting the improvement of labor protection work.

            Several Issues in the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations

    After the promulgation of this draft regulation, it immediately aroused the joy and encouragement of the working class across the country. At the same time, it also launched a heated discussion among the working masses and was warmly supported by the broad masses of workers and staff. Now I would like to raise a few issues in the draft Labor Insurance Regulations for everyone to discuss and study.

    The first issue is the scope of application of labor insurance. The regulations in this draft adopt a key pilot method. At present, it is temporarily applicable to (1) state-owned, joint state-private, and private factories, mines, and their affiliated units and business management agencies that employ more than 100 employees; (2) each enterprise unit and affiliated unit affiliated to railways, shipping, post and telecommunications, and banks. Do we need these restrictions on these two "number of people" and "industry"? We can study it. Why do we have such regulations? The main reason is that the workers and staff in factories and mines with less than 100 people are relatively scattered and have not been well organized, and we now want to implement the labor insurance system with the trade union as the implementing agency. Before the trade union organization is sound, it is difficult to do a good job of labor insurance. In order to remedy this deficiency, the draft regulations also stipulate that factories and mines with less than 100 people can be resolved by the enterprise administration or the capitalist and the trade union organization jointly negotiating and signing collective contracts. Secondly, the delineation of the scope of this draft regulation also distinguishes between the direct production agencies and the administrative management agencies of the enterprise. Workers and staff in the direct production departments of the enterprise have labor insurance, which can stimulate production. Although the enterprise bears the insurance money, its production has increased. The workers and staff in the administrative management agencies also have labor insurance, which can also stimulate administrative efficiency, but because it does not directly produce itself, it needs the state treasury to bear this insurance money, which increases the state treasury expenditure. At the present time when the country is in difficulty, it is still impossible to do it; therefore, the workers and staff in the central government system and various departments directly paid by the state treasury at all levels are also temporarily not included in the scope of application.

    The second issue is the standard for the collection of labor insurance money. Some comrades believe that the Soviet Union's labor insurance money is 3.7% of the total wage, while we uniformly stipulate 3%. It is unavoidable that it is too low, and the nature of each enterprise is different, and the rates of injury, disability, and illness are also different. Stating that 3% is uniform seems to be committing the mistake of egalitarianism. In fact, our labor insurance money collected at 3% of the total wage is not small at present. Our labor insurance benefits are divided into two parts. All short-term benefits that are closely related to the enterprise, such as various holiday wages, medical expenses for disease treatment, etc., are directly paid by the enterprise administration or the capitalist, and are not paid from the labor insurance money. The various long-term expenditures paid from the labor insurance fund are, such as pensions, subsidies, old-age pensions, etc. In this way, 3% of the total wage is enough to cope with various insurance benefits. According to the experience of Northeast China, 3% is not a small amount. As for whether it is committing the mistake of egalitarianism? In fact, there is a difference in the actual expenditure of labor insurance for enterprises with different natures: heavy industry has more accidents and the enterprise bears a heavier burden, while light industry has fewer accidents and the enterprise bears a lighter burden. According to the experience of Northeast China, the total expenditure of labor insurance is about 6-8% of the total wage in light industry and about 12-15% of the total wage in heavy industry. This shows that there is no mistake of egalitarianism.

    The third issue is the standard of various labor insurance benefits. Is the standard of benefits too low? Can it be raised a little? This is the issue that the working masses pay the most attention to and is worthy of research and discussion. Undoubtedly, every employee hopes to be able to raise the labor insurance benefits in order to fully protect the lives of workers. However, because our labor insurance is entirely based on the actual situation, we cannot raise the benefits very high at the beginning, like the Soviet social insurance system. The Soviet Union has undergone more than 30 years of socialist construction to have such high benefits today. Our current liberation war has not yet ended completely, and we still have to liberate Taiwan. US imperialism is expanding its conspiracy of aggression. We most need to build a strong national defense. In the high tide of the national people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and countries, we cannot and should not make such a request. Our working class is the master of the country. We should not improve our own benefits, disregard the needs of other aspects, and increase the burden on the people. Only by working hard to increase production, "an inch longer in production" will "bring a little more" welfare. Only under the development of the production situation can welfare be gradually improved.

            Basic Understanding of the Current Implementation of Labor Insurance

    Now let's talk about our basic understanding of labor insurance:

    First, the basic spirit of this draft Labor Insurance Regulations is to cover all employed laborers, and to take care of the employed laborers across the country. This is very clear in the provisions of Article 1 of this draft regulation. Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the draft Labor Insurance Regulations clearly stipulates that the formulation of the Labor Insurance Regulations is to protect the health of employed laborers and alleviate their special difficulties and concerns in life.

    Second, because we are only starting to implement labor insurance at present, and because our liberation war has not yet ended completely, it is impossible to implement labor insurance at the beginning. But our labor insurance is constantly developing and expanding. Even today's Labor Insurance Regulations are a step higher than the Northeast Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations, and have expanded from labor insurance for state-owned enterprises to labor insurance for private enterprises. We must learn from the Soviet Union and develop towards the direction of the Soviet social insurance.

    Third, our current draft Labor Insurance Regulations is formulated under the two conditions of "possibility" and "necessity," and is a steady advance and gradual development that combines urgency with possibility. If we initially focus on solving all the problems of labor insurance at once and do not pay due attention to the reality of possibility, it will increase the burden on the state finances and increase the actual difficulties of many private enterprises. That is a leap forward, not a steady advance.

    Fourth, the implementation of national labor insurance is a pioneering work in Chinese history, and we will start from here to gain experience. From nothing to something, from small to large, from less to more, from low to high, we will gradually create experience, and on this basis, we will gradually improve the labor insurance benefits and gradually expand the scope of the Labor Insurance Regulations.

    Fifth, we must start from an overall point of view. From this regulation, we understand that this is a great step forward in the protection of the working class. This method was impossible in the past under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Our method is a great victory for the entire Chinese working class. At present, enterprises with more than 100 people can quickly start implementing labor insurance. Enterprises with less than 100 people cannot implement it temporarily, but trade unions can negotiate and sign collective contracts with the administration or the capitalist with reference to the regulations. We must also look at this issue from an overall perspective. Generally speaking, workers are much better off than farmers. Farmers still bear a heavy burden, and the economic foundation of the Chinese revolution is built on the foundation of the peasant economy. We cannot excessively increase their burden. Workers should look at it from the overall point of view of the country and should not make excessive demands. Furthermore, the People's Liberation Army is still living a supply system life. They are still bearing the task of the great revolutionary war in history. Therefore, for the interests of the country and the interests of the people, our working class, in order to bear the political task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, must measure our Labor Insurance Regulations from the standpoint of the overall concept.

            Impact and Role of Implementing Labor Insurance

    Finally, let's talk about the impact and role of the regulations.

    First, the promulgation and implementation of this regulation is related to the vital interests of the working class across the country. There are about 15 million to 20 million workers in the country. If each worker has three to four family members (including the employees themselves, it is a family of four or five), then this regulation is actually related to the material and cultural lives of 80 million to 100 million people, that is to say, one-sixth to one-fifth of the national population will enjoy the benefits of this regulation.

    Second, it will play a great role in improving the health and alleviating the living difficulties of one-sixth to one-fifth of the population, and at the same time, it can improve the political consciousness of the broad masses of working people, especially for the enthusiasm of production, which can be greatly stimulated. This is the situation after the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations in Northeast China, which has been confirmed. Many workers are actively working in factories. Old workers have no worries about old age. The feudal thinking of not being willing to teach their skills completely to apprentices and keeping a hand for themselves is also gone. At the same time, there are no worries about birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability. It has given full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the work and strengthened the sense of responsibility as the master of the country. They all feel that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it is very different from the Kuomintang rule in the past. Whether in politics, economy, or life, they have been guaranteed, and production efficiency has greatly improved.

    Third, the promulgation and implementation of this regulation has also strengthened the connection between the trade union organization and the working masses, enriched the content of the trade union work in the future, made it more integrated with the masses, further strengthened the workers' belief and love for the trade union organization, and further expanded and consolidated the strength of the workers' organization; consolidating and expanding the trade union organization is to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, we must regard this labor insurance work as a current political task. This work has a very important relationship with the consolidation of the people's democratic regime, the improvement of labor production enthusiasm, and the expansion of the influence of trade union organizations. We must complete it as a political task.

    To do a good job in labor insurance, we must get the common cooperation of the labor administrative agencies, the enterprise administration, and the trade union organizations. This labor insurance training class of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School has gathered cadres from the labor administrative agencies, the enterprise administration, and the trade union organizations from all over the country to learn from each other and exchange experiences. This is the beginning of doing a good job in labor insurance. All comrades have rich experience, and some have made great research in the business theory of labor insurance. I believe that in the learning process of about a month, we will be able to research and discuss a set of implementation methods for the labor insurance system that meet the actual needs. The Chinese labor insurance system will be implemented with the joint efforts of all comrades. The working class across the country is waiting for the results of your hard work. Comrades, this is the beginning of a great political task. Let me wish you the successful completion of this task in advance.

                                             (Reprinted from Worker's Daily)

　　新中国的劳动保险制度
    中华全国总工会副主席朱学范在天津全总干部学校
    劳动保险干部训练班的讲话
    （一九五○年十二月十日）
            革命胜利的果实
    中央人民政府政务院十月二十九日公布了中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案，广泛地征求各方面的意见，准备再修正通过后开始实行。这一条例的公布与实行，在中国劳动立法的历史上是空前未有的，是我们中国工人阶级在中国共产党与毛主席英明领导下伟大的革命胜利果实。早在二十八年前即一九二二年，在中国共产党领导的中国劳动组合书记部，即开始为改善工人阶级的生活而进行不断的英勇斗争，把劳动保险作为劳动立法运动的一个重要的斗争目标。中国工人阶级在中国共产党与毛主席领导下，经过长期的坚苦斗争，今天已经建立了自己的国家政权，公布了劳动保险条例草案，以保护工人、职员群众的健康，并减轻其生活中的特殊困难与顾虑，这只有在中国共产党与毛主席领导下的人民政权才能为我们工人阶级颁布这个保护工人的法令，这是值得我们大家来热烈庆贺的。
    今天中国是以工人阶级为领导的人民民主政权的国家，中国工人阶级已经是国家与社会的主人翁。毛主席曾指出了经济政策的基本原则也就是劳动政策的基本原则。“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利。”就是要以“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的手段，来达到“发展生产、繁荣经济”的目的。因此，在公营企业中，必须照顾“公”的利益，即国家的利益；同时也必须照顾“私”的利益，即个人利益。在私营企业中，应同时照顾工人的利益与资本家的利益。过去中国千百年来的旧社会，从来没有照顾到工人阶级的利益，统治阶级只照顾官僚资本公营企业，所谓“公”的利益，和私人资本家所谓“私”的利益。工人是奴隶，是牛马，根本没有当作人看待，那里能够得到工人阶级应得的利益呢？今天，我们工人阶级有了自己的政府，在中国共产党与毛主席领导下，掌握了马列主义——劳动创造世界的真理，唯有劳动人民是最值得崇敬和重视的。刘少奇同志在今年北京庆祝五一劳动节干部大会上讲话说：“……人类世界以至人类本身，乃是从劳动中创造的。劳动乃是人类社会赖以生存和发展的基础，劳动者乃是文明的创造者。因此，劳动应该成为世界上最受尊敬的事情，劳动者应该成为世界上最受尊敬的人们”。在一九四八年全国第六次劳动大会通过决议：“在工厂集中的城市，或条件具备的地方，可以创办劳动的社会保险。”在去年人民政协通过的共同纲领第三十二条中就有了“逐步实行劳动保险制度”的明文规定。毛主席所提示出来的劳动政策的基本原则，已成为中央人民政府劳动政策的指导原理。全国范围的劳动保险条例的实施，是毛主席的劳动政策的具体表现。
            改变“重视机器，不重视人”的剥削制度
    过去中国社会由于千百年来“重视机器，不重视人”的剥削制度的后果，工矿企业中发生灾害事故与工人遭受疾病死亡的情况，非常严重。东北在日本占领时代，抚顺煤矿有一次炸死三千多人，众所周知的鹤岗煤矿还有“万人坑”，反动派从来不重视这个问题。现在我们站在重视人、劳动创造世界的真理立场上，就觉得非常严重。目前情况与过去已经大大的不同了，但还很严重。去年东北一月至五月平均生产每一万吨煤，死○·二九人，即生产三万多吨煤，就要死一人伤十四人。华北去年一至八月生产一万吨煤，死○·四九人，即生产两万吨煤，就死一人，伤二十五人。这就是没有安全卫生设备，旧社会“重视机器，不重视人”遗留下来的恶果。这种旧社会遗留下来的恶果，不是短时期内一下子就能改变得好的。所以在工矿企业中发生的灾害事故、以及工人的疾病死亡伤残，就成为工人阶级的特殊困难与顾虑。
    这次中央人民政府政务院公布的劳动保险条例草案，对于保护工人的健康与减轻其生活中的特殊困难与顾虑，将起很大的积极作用。东北实施劳动保险条例后，六十三万工人与职员及其家属约一百五十万人都享受了劳动保险的待遇。自一九四九年四月至十月，七个月中，在铁路、矿山、纺织、邮电、电业五大国营企业领到劳保金的人数，就有五万五千二百○四人，这就说明了在工人阶级中间是存在着生、老、病、死、伤残种种特殊困难与顾虑的。现在我们中央人民政府政务院所公布的劳动保险条例草案，就可使工人与职员暂时或长期丧失劳动力时，获得基本保障，由国家法令规定企业行政或资方，拨出劳动保险金给工人与职员，物质上必需的补助及其他有关劳动保险待遇，达到保护公私企业中工人与职员的健康与减轻特殊困难，而搞好生产，使财富增加，国民经济加速恢复发展，逐步提高工人与职员以及全国人民生活物质条件，以至全体劳动人民过着美好的幸福生活。这就是实施劳动保险条例的目的。
    中国工人阶级过去在国民党反动派的统治时代，遇到疾病死亡伤残等等不幸事故，差不多都是没有办法解决的。中国在帝国主义封建势力与官僚资本主义统治之下，工人阶级生活上的痛苦是不会得到资本家的关心的。资本家所最关心的，是“机器”，而不是“人”，把机器设备、原料、器材看得比工人职员更重要、更值钱。工人遇到疾病等，资本家的办法，就是告假扣工资，或者简单的开除了事。遇到伤亡，就是找“红十字会”，“普善山庄”等慈善机关，即使要资本家拿一些钱来，必须向他们恳求。他们以慈善家的身份来做善事，这叫做大慈善家的慈善事业。工人阶级被他们残酷的压迫榨取，直接间接地谋害了，而这种凶手却称为大慈善家，还有什么真理？还有什么是非？
            资本主义国家的劳动保险是统治工人的一种手段
    国民党反动派企图缓和工人阶级的斗争，分化工人阶级的力量，对有些企业，如外商企业，邮电企业的工人阶级的斗争，不得不让步，但这些企业的工人所争取到类似劳动保险的局部的补助办法，是很混乱、很不公平、很不合理的办法。如脑力劳动者高于体力劳动者，男工多于女工等，企图使工人阶级内部引起分化作用，使之永远屈服在他们的统治之下。另外更不合理的就是保险金，并不是由企业方面来负担，而是从工人工资中扣除。如伪资源委员会，就扣除工人与职员工资的百分之○·五，这是抄袭资本主义国家的老办法：“工人出钱，资本家作面子”。
    资本主义国家的保险金大部分是要工人与职员本身来负担的，实际上就是一种变相的附加税，变成了削剥工人的工具，工人付出了很多的钱，但得到的补助金和抚恤金很少。如美国工人一九三八——一九四二年共交了四十三亿多美金，而工人所得到的养老保险金，不足八亿美金，却养了大批官僚机关的职员。当我在美国的时候，我曾亲眼看到过，他们劳动保险机关的开支约等于保险金的三分之一。他们举办的集体事业，也不是给工人预备的。在纽约附近有一个休养所，当我在那里的时候，这休养所的负责人向我宣传如何便宜，如何完善，完全为工人所服务。我去住了两天，结果，给我开来了一张发票是三十元美金，像这样多的费用，那里是为工人服务而设的？完全是为剥削工人而设的。工人怎能住得起呢？所以说，工人是得不到什么劳动保险的真实利益的。实际是拿工人的钱，来雇一些为资本家服务的走狗，用来控制和剥削工人阶级的。像这种办法是最恶毒、阴险无比的。
    一般资本主义国家的社会保险是残缺不全的。在第二次世界大战以前，四十一个国家没有养老保险，四十九个国家没有疾病保险，五十三个国家没有残废保险。而资本主义国家举办社会保险的目的，不是为了解决工人阶级的特殊困难，而是为了企图麻痹并消灭工人阶级的斗争情绪，以维持剥削阶级的统治秩序，他们与我们人民民主国家的劳动保险本质上是完全不同的。
            苏联的社会保险制度是世界上最先进的社会保险制度
    社会主义国家苏联的社会保险制度，是世界上最先进的、最完善的制度。苏联全体劳动人民都可享受到社会保险利益的权利，保障了全体工人与职员，不必为疾病、伤残、年老等意外事故担心。在苏联看到劳动人民在矿山工厂里工作，非常愉快。他们在矿山工厂所发生的意外事故已经减得很少，同时有了世界上最完善的保险制度。生老病死伤残，已经不是在他们脑筋里所要顾虑的事情，他们所要顾虑的是怎样努力生产，完成任务，争取当劳动模范；同时在计划过他们的假期时，偕同自己的伴侣，去黑海边上的休养所呢？还是去莫斯科郊外的休养所？这些是资本主义国家所办不到的。在英国他们有所谓失业保险，失了业就有保险吗？但是每个工人都在担心着失业，这是为什么呢？因为失业保险救济金很少，仅为工资的百分之二十五，而减少了工资的百分之七十五，所以虽有失业保险，却顾虑着失业。而苏联从来没有失业的现象，所以无用顾虑失业。苏联社会保险制度的一切保险经费完全由国家负担。苏联于一九四九年就有一一○亿卢布，用于社会保险，成为改善工人阶级物质与文化生活的主要因素之一。这是伟大的十月革命胜利的果实，本质上与任何资本主义保险制度完全不同的。
            新中国的劳动保险制度与苏联社会保险制度本质上是相同的
    我们新中国所公布的劳动保险条例草案，是标志着中国劳动保险制度的开始。中国劳动保险制度，在目前虽然还不可能像苏联的社会保险制度那样完善，但将来一定是向着苏联社会保险制度所走的道路前进的，中国的劳动保险制度将来一定会发展为像苏联现在的社会保险制度一样。因此，我们中国劳动保险制度本质上与苏联的社会保险制度精神上基本相同的；而与资本主义国家的社会保险制度则是相反的。
    现在我想将这个劳动保险条例草案的特点说一说：
    第一个特点：就是从工人的实际需要出发，真心实意来解决工人阶级生活中所遇到的特殊困难，不是像资本主义国家社会保险制度那样是从一种买卖式观点出发，讨价还价方式来对待工人，掉了一只手给多少钱，死了一个人给多少钱。我们新民主主义国家的劳动保险条例，不是为了别的，而是完全为了工人阶级的利益，为了保护劳动者的健康、减轻其生活中的特殊困难，解除其顾虑，病了给他治病，老了给他养老，对工人阶级生活中所遭遇的困难完全以负责任的态度，来求得解决。
    第二个特点：是劳动保险的一切费用完全由企业行政或资方负担，公营企业由企业行政拨付，私营企业由资本家在企业中拨付，不得再向工人征收任何保险费用。在资本主义国家的工人阶级不可能享受到这样的利益。
    第三个特点：就是我们中国劳动保险一开始就掌握在工人阶级自己的手里，由工人阶级自己的工会组织来执行劳动保险事情。工会最能了解工人需要，由工会掌握执行这件事情，才能够公平合理，这与资本主义国家的保险制度是完全不同的。资本主义国家办理社会保险事业的官僚机构，耗费了很多的保险金，豢养了一批专事控制与剥削工人的走狗，没有把全部保险金用于工人阶级保险的事业上，而我们的保险金不作执行业务的行政开支，完全是用在工人职员群众身上的。
    第四个特点：就是我们的劳动保险包括生育、养老、疾病、死亡、伤残等各种保险，对于工人生活中可能发生的特殊困难加以全面的照顾，并且还举办休养所、疗养院、残废院、养老院、孤儿保育院等各种集体劳动保险事业。资本主义国家的社会保险是局部的、零星的，我们的劳动保险是全面的、集体的、根本的。
    第五个特点：就是我们的劳动保险对于工作上有特殊贡献的劳动模范和转入企业工作的战斗英雄及残废军人可以得到特别优异的劳动保险待遇，这是我们新社会对于为人民服务、为人民革命事业生产建设有特殊贡献者，表示尊敬的一种新道德。
    第六个特点：就是我们的劳动保险对于工会会员与非会员的待遇是不同的，因为在新民主主义社会是鼓励人民组织起来的，工会是国家政权有力的支柱，为了促使那些思想比较落后的工人与职员积极参加工会，以加强工会组织的力量，这一规定是适当的。
    第七个特点：就是我们的条例对于推动改进劳动保护工作起了积极作用。我们知道劳动保险与劳动保护是有密切联系的，在我们劳动保险金百分之三开支以外，如疾病的医疗、及短期治疗期间的工资，都由企业行政方面或资方负担，而不包括百分之三劳动保险金之内。企业行政方面或资方如果劳动保护安全卫生设备不好，对工人的身体是有莫大妨碍，疾病伤亡率就大，企业行政方面或资方负担就多，为了减轻劳动保险费用的负担，企业行政方面或资方，就得重视劳动保护工作。因此这个条例里除百分之三保险金外，规定企业行政方面与资方负担假期与医药费用，因之企业行政方面与资方为要减低这项支出，必须先注意劳动保护事宜，所以这个劳动保险条例就成为推动改进劳动保护工作的积极因素。
            劳动保险条例草案中的几个问题
    这个条例草案公布以后，立刻引起了全国工人阶级的欢欣鼓舞，同时在工人群众中间也就展开了热烈的讨论，是受到了广大工人职员群众热烈拥护的。现在我想把劳动保险条例草案中的几个问题提出来，供大家讨论和研究。
    第一个问题是劳动保险适用范围的问题。这一条例草案的规定，采取重点试行办法，目前暂时适用于（１）雇用职工人数在一百人以上的国营、公私合营、私营的工厂矿场及其附属单位与业务管理机关；（２）铁路、航运、邮电、银行所属的各企业单位及附属单位。这两个“人数”与“产业”的限制，要不要这个限制，我们可以研究的。我们为什么要这样的规定呢？主要的因为在百人以下的工厂、矿场的职工是比较分散的，还没有很好的全部组织起来，而我们现在要实施劳动保险制度，是以工会为执行机构的，在工会组织还没有健全之前，就很难做好劳动保险工作。为了补救这种缺陷，所以条例草案又规定百人以下的工厂、矿场，可由企业行政方面或资方与工会组织共同协商订立集体合同的办法来解决。其次这个条例草案对于范围的划分还有企业直接生产机关与行政管理机关的区别，企业直接生产部门工人职员有了劳动保险可以刺激生产，企业虽则负担了保险金，它的生产增加了。而行政管理机关工人职员有了劳动保险也可以刺激行政效率，但因为它本身不直接生产，需要国库来负担这笔保险金，增加了国库开支，在今天国家困难的时候还是无法办到的；所以今天中央政府系统以及各级公教人员直接由国库开支的各部门的工人与职员，暂时也都不包括在适用范围内。
    第二个问题是劳动保险金征收的标准问题。有些同志认为苏联的劳动保险金是征收工资总额的百分之三·七，而我们一律规定了百分之三。未免太低，况且各企业的性质不一，伤残和疾病率也各有不同，一律规定百分之三似乎犯了平均主义的毛病，实际上我们的劳动保险金征收工资总额的百分之三在目前讲并不算少。我们的劳保待遇共分两部分，凡是短期的，与企业发生密切关系的，如各种假期工资，疾病治疗医药费等都是由企业行政或资方直接支付，不在劳动保险金中开支。由劳动保险基金开支的，是各种长期性的支出，如抚恤金、补助金、养老金等。这样百分之三的工资总额就足以应付各项保险待遇，根据东北经验百分之三并不算少。至于是不是犯了平均主义的毛病呢？实际上，性质不同的企业在劳动保险的实际支出中就有区别：重工业事故多，企业负担重，轻工业事故少，企业负担少。根据东北的经验，劳动保险的总支出，在轻工业方面约为工资总额的百分之六——八，重工业方面约为工资总额的百分之十二——十五。说明了并无平均主义的毛病。
    第三个问题是劳动保险各项待遇标准问题。待遇标准，是不是过低，可否提高些呢？这是工人群众最注意的问题，值得研究讨论的。无疑地每个职工都希望能够把劳动保险待遇提高，以充分保障劳动者的生活，但由于我们的劳动保险，完全是根据实际情况出发的，我们现在所处的实际情况，无法把待遇一开始就提得很高，像苏联的社会保险制度那样高。苏联是经过了三十多年的社会主义建设，才能有今天这样高的待遇。我们现在的解放战争还没有全部结束，还得解放台湾，美帝正在扩大侵略阴谋，我们最需建设强大的国防，全国人民在抗美援朝保家卫国运动高潮中，我们不可能也不应该提出这样的要求，我们工人阶级是国家的主人翁，不应该提高自己的待遇，不顾其他方面需要，而加重人民负担。只有努力增加生产，“生产长一寸”“福利”才会“多一分”，只有在生产情况发展下，福利才能逐渐提高。
            对目前实行劳动保险应有的基本认识
    现在谈谈我们对于劳动保险应有的基本认识：
    第一、这个劳动保险条例草案的基本精神，是以全体雇用劳动者为范围，要照顾到全国的雇用劳动人民的。在这个条例草案第一条的规定中，已规定得很清楚了，劳动保险草案第一章第一条明白规定劳动保险条例的制定，是为了保护雇佣劳动者的健康，并减轻其生活中的特殊困难与顾虑。
    第二、因为目前我们只是开始实行劳动保险，加以目前我们的解放战争尚未完全结束，就不可能一开始都实行劳动保险。但我们的劳动保险是在不断发展和扩大着的。即以今天的劳动保险条例来说，已经是比较东北战时暂行劳动保险条例提高了一步，已从公营企业的劳动保险扩大到私营企业的劳动保险。我们要向苏联学习，走向苏联的社会保险方向来发展。
    第三、我们目前的劳动保险条例草案是在“可能”与“必要”的两个条件下拟订的，是迫切性结合着可能性来稳步前进，逐步发展的。如果一开始就偏重于劳动保险的一切问题都要一下全部解决而对于现实的可能性不加以应有的重视，那就更加重国家财政的负担，更增加许多私营企业的实际困难，那就是跨步前进不是稳步前进了。
    第四、实行全国性的劳动保险，在中国历史上是个创举，从这里开始来搞经验。从无到有，从小到大，从少到多，从低到高，逐步的创造经验，在这个基础上逐步的使劳动保险的待遇提高，逐步的使劳动保险条例的范围扩大。
    第五、要从整体观点出发，从这个条例来看，我们明白这是对工人阶级的保障大大的提高了一步，在过去国民党反动统治时代是不可能有这个办法的，我们这个办法，是中国工人阶级整个阶级的伟大胜利。目前，百人以上的企业很快就可开始实行劳动保险，百人以下的企业，暂时还不能实行，但可以由工会与行政或资方参考条例协商订立集体合同。我们还要用整体观念来看这个问题，一般说来，工人比农民都好得多，农民负担还很重，况且中国的革命的经济基础建筑在农民经济基础上，不能过于加重他们的负担，工人应从国家整体观点上来看，不应提出过高要求。再说现在人民解放军还是过的供给制生活，他们还负担着历史上伟大的革命战争的任务，因此我们工人阶级为了国家的利益，人民的利益，以负担抗美援朝的政治任务，必须以整体观念为出发点。来衡量我们的劳动保险条例。
            实行劳动保险的影响和作用
    最后谈一谈条例的影响和作用。
    第一、这个条例的颁布与实行，关系着全国工人阶级的切身利益，全国工人约有一千五百万到二千万人，每一工人如有三个到四个家属（连职工本人就是四口或五口之家），则这个条例实际上关系着八千万到一万万人民的物质生活与文化生活，即是说全国人口将有六分之一到五分之一享受到这个条例的利益。
    第二、对于六分之一到五分之一人口的健康和生活困难的减轻，将起很大的作用，同时对全国广大劳动人民的政治觉悟也可以提高一步，尤其对于生产的积极性，可以大大的刺激。这是东北劳动保险条例实施以后的情况，是已经得到证实了的。许多工人在工厂里积极的作工，年老工人有了养老就没有顾虑了，从前不肯把自己会的技术完全教给徒弟，自己留一手的封建思想也没有了，同时也没有生、老、病、死、伤、残的顾虑，发挥了工作的积极性与创造性，加强了国家主人翁的责任感，他们都觉得在共产党与毛主席的领导下与以前在国民党统治时期大大的不同了，无论是在政治上、经济上、生活上，都得到了保障，生产效率大大的提高了一步。
    第三、这个条例公布与实施，同时也加强了工会组织与工人群众之间的联系，使今后工会工作的内容更为丰富，更能与群众打成一片，更加强工人群众对于工会组织的信仰与热爱，更进一步地扩大与巩固了工人组织的力量；巩固与扩大工会组织，就是巩固人民民主专政政权。因此我们必须把这个劳动保险工作作为当前的政治任务来看待，这个工作对于人民民主政权的巩固，对于劳动生产积极性的提高，以及对于工会组织影响的扩大，都有非常重大的关系，我们必须把它当作政治任务来完成。
    要搞好劳动保险工作，必须得到劳动行政机关、企业行政方面与工会组织三方面工作的共同配合。这次中华全国总工会干校劳动保险训练班集合了全国各地方来的劳动行政机关、企业行政方面与工会组织三方面的干部，相互学习，交流经验，这是搞好劳动保险工作的开始。各位同志都有丰富的经验，有的在劳动保险的业务理论上很有研究，我相信在这一个月左右的学习过程中，一定能够研究和讨论出一套切合实际需要的劳动保险制度实施办法来，中国的劳动保险制度要在各位同志共同努力中付诸实施。全国工人阶级都在等待着你们努力工作的成果。同志们这是一个伟大的政治任务的开始，让我预祝你们这个任务的胜利完成。
