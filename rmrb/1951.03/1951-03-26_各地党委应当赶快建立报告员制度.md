　　Party Committees in Various Regions Should Quickly Establish a Reporting System
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, etc., has announced the list of Party reporters at the municipal level. This is an important step in establishing the Party's propaganda network and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses. The central government had already made clear provisions in the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party" to establish a system of Party reporters in provinces, cities, localities, counties, and districts. However, to date, there are not many regions that have publicly announced the list of reporters like the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. This should be brought to the attention of Party committees at all levels.
    From the list of reporters announced by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, etc., it can be seen that the main responsible comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, including Comrade Chen Yi, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and alternate members of the Central Committee, Liu Xiao and Liu Changsheng, as well as the Party members in charge of various organs and organizations, have all served as Party reporters. This is a key to ensuring that the work of reporters can be done well. With these responsible Party members regularly reporting to the people on current affairs at home and abroad, the policies of the Party and the People's Government, the tasks of the people, promoting and introducing the model experiences of the people in production and other work, refuting various reactionary rumors and erroneous ideas circulating among the people, this can not only urge the leaders of the Party and the People's Government to speak directly to the masses on a regular basis, but also enable the people to more fully understand the various propositions of the Party, and thus trust the Party and the People's Government even more.
    The establishment of the reporting system is a powerful impetus to the development of propaganda work. According to the experience of establishing a propaganda network in the Northeast, Party committees at all levels must get rid of the empty and meaningless "principled policy leadership" of propagandists, and must personally take the lead in propaganda work. Only with reporters can the propagandists be systematically led.
    Moreover, if the establishment of the propaganda system still requires certain preparatory conditions, then the difficulty of establishing the reporting system is much less. All places that have not yet established a system of Party reporters should strive to establish the system of Party reporters first in the shortest possible time.

### 各地党委应当赶快建立报告员制度

　　各地党委应当赶快建立报告员制度
    中共上海市委员会等宣布了市一级党的报告员名单，这是建立党的宣传网，密切党与群众关系的一个重要步骤。在省、市、地方、县和区建立党的报告员制度，中央早已在《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》中作了明确的规定，但是至今为止，像上海市委这样公开地向人民群众宣布报告员名单的地区还不多。这是值得引起各级党的委员会注意的。
    从中共上海市委员会等宣布的报告员名单中可以看到，上海市委的主要负责同志，包括中共中央委员陈毅同志和候补中央委员刘晓、刘长胜同志，以及各机关团体中负主要责任的党员，都担任了党的报告员。这是保证报告员工作能够作好的一个关键，党有了这些负责党员经常向人民群众报告国内外时事，党和人民政府的政策，人民群众的任务，宣传与介绍人民群众在生产劳动和其他工作中的模范经验，驳斥各种反动谣言及在人民群众中流传的错误思想，这就不但可以督促党和人民政府的领导者经常地直接向群众讲话，而且可以使人民群众更充分地了解党的各种主张，因而更加信任党和人民政府。
    报告员制度的建立，对于宣传员工作的开展是一个有力的推动。根据东北建立宣传网的经验，各级党的委员会，要摆脱对宣传员的空洞无物的“原则政策领导”，必须亲自动手，以身作则地来作宣传工作。有了报告员，才能对宣传员进行系统的领导。
    而且，如果宣传员制度的建立还要一定的准备条件的话，那么，建立报告员制度的困难就少得多。凡是还没有建立党的报告员制度的地方，都应该努力在最短期内，把党的报告员制度首先建立起来。
