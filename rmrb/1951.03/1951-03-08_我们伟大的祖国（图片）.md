Our Great Motherland
    The women of New China have produced many heroic figures in the revolutionary struggle. This is Rong Guanxiu, a specially invited representative to the First Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from Xiapan Song Village, Pingshan County, Hebei Province. During the most difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War, she disregarded all difficulties and rescued wounded and sick soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. At the Hero Conference in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in 1944, she was awarded the honorary title of "Mother of the Soldiers." In production, she is also a labor hero.

　　我们伟大的祖国
    新中国的妇女，在革命斗争中出现了许多英雄人物。这是第一届中国人民政治协商会议特邀代表河北平山县下盘松村的妇女戎冠秀。她在抗日战争最艰苦的年月中，曾不顾一切困难，救护解放军的伤病员，在一九四四年晋察冀边区的群英大会中，她获得了“子弟兵的母亲”的光荣称号。在生产中她又是一个劳动英雄。
