　　Relief Administration and Red Cross Society of China
    Denounce MacArthur's Shameless Lies
    Determine to Do a Good Job in Relief Work and Strengthen Anti-American Forces
    [Report from this newspaper] The culprit MacArthur, who provokes war and destroys human peace, after a series of lies such as "going home for Thanksgiving," "going home for Christmas," "general offensive to end the war," and "can hold the line," issued another arrogant statement on March 24, "expanding military operations to China." Proven by past facts, MacArthur's bragging will eventually perish with himself. But aggressors are, after all, aggressors, and we cannot but pay close attention to MacArthur's shameless lies. The liberated Chinese people are working hard to overcome disasters and build a beautiful paradise for mankind, while the aggressors are deliberately igniting the flames of aggressive war in China, Korea, Asia, and even the world, in an attempt to destroy our cause. We should be more vigilant! The Chinese people have stood up, and no one can scare us. We, on behalf of the relief and welfare circles of China, solemnly declare: National relief and welfare workers are determined to take strong actions to do a good job in relieving Korean refugees, handling relief agencies accepting American subsidies, providing medical and preventive services to Korean soldiers and civilians, improving China's social relief and welfare work, and strengthening the resistance to America and aid to Korea, so as to promote the early collapse of American warmongers.

　　救济总会和红十字会总会
    斥麦克阿瑟无耻狂言     
    决做好救济工作加强反美力量
    【本报讯】中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会总会发表声明，痛斥麦克阿瑟无耻狂言，声明如下：
    挑拨战争破坏人类和平的罪魁麦克阿瑟，继“感恩节回家”，“圣诞节回家”，“结束战争总攻势”，“可以保持阵地”等等一连串的牛皮吹破以后，三月二十四日又发表了“把军事行动扩展到中国去”的狂妄声明。由既往事实证明，麦克阿瑟的吹牛，总有一天会与他自己同归于尽的。但侵略者总归是侵略者，麦克阿瑟的无耻狂言，我们不能不予以密切注意。解放了的中国人民正在努力克服灾难，进行缔造人类美好乐园的事业，而侵略者却蓄意在中国、朝鲜、亚洲，甚至全世界燃起侵略战争的火焰，妄想摧毁我们的事业，我们更应提高警惕！中国人民站起来了，谁也吓不倒我们。我们代表全中国救济福利界郑重声明：全国救济福利工作者，决以坚强的行动，做好救济朝鲜难民，处理接受美国津贴的救济机关，朝鲜军民的医防服务，改进中国社会救济福利工作，加强抗美援朝力量，以促使美国战争贩子们早日垮台。
