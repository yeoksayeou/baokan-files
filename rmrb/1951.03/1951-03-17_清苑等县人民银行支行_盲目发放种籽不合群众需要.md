To the Editor:

Due to a lack of in-depth investigation into the needs of farmers for spring seeds, the branches of the People's Bank in Qingyuan and Xiong Counties, Hebei Province, blindly purchased large quantities of barley and vetch seeds, resulting in losses. For example, the Qingyuan County branch forcibly distributed prepared barley seeds to thirty-seven severely affected villages. As a result, because the farmers did not need them, more than 10,000 jin could not be loaned out. Some villages (such as Shenzhuang) urgently needed vetch seeds, but the bank insisted on allocating barley seeds to them. In Xiong County, only 20,000 jin of barley seeds were loaned out in ten days, leaving more than 60,000 jin that could not be loaned out. On the other hand, because the bank did not make any preparations when purchasing seeds, it caused local prices to rise at one point. For example, the price of barley in Qingyuan rose from 800 yuan to 900 yuan per jin. Coupled with handling fees and losses, the price of the seeds now being loaned out is 180 yuan higher per jin than the market price. In terms of lending methods, the Xiong County bank did not mobilize the masses for democratic appraisal, resulting in unfair lending. Many seeds were loaned to farmers who did not lack seeds, and as a result, they were eaten or resold by them. These biases greatly reduced the government's role in supporting agricultural production. I believe that the Qingyuan and Xiong County branches of the People's Bank should conduct public self-criticisms.

### 清苑等县人民银行支行 盲目发放种籽不合群众需要

    清苑等县人民银行支行
    盲目发放种籽不合群众需要编辑同志：
    河北省清苑县和雄县人民银行支行由于不深入调查农民春季种籽的需要情况，即盲目地收购大批大麦和菀豆种籽，造成了损失。如清苑县支行将准备的大麦种籽硬分配到三十七个重灾村，结果由于农民并不需要，所以还有一万多斤贷不出去；有的村庄（如申庄）很需要菀豆种，银行却偏给拨去大麦种。雄县三区在十几天里只贷出两万斤大麦种，尚存六万多斤无法贷出。另一方面，因为银行收购种籽时，未作任何准备，曾引起当地物价一度上涨。如清苑大麦就从每斤八百元上涨到九百元。再加上手续费和亏损，现在出贷的种籽每斤反比市价高出一百八十元。在放贷方法上，如雄县银行因为没有发动群众民主评议，致使放贷不公，很多种籽贷给了不缺种籽的农户，结果被他们自己吃掉或转卖了。这些偏向大大地减低了政府扶助农民生产的作用。我认为清苑和雄县人民银行支行应作公开的检讨。
