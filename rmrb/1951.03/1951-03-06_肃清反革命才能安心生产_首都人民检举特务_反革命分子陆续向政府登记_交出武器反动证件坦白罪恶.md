Eliminating Counter-revolutionaries Ensures Peaceful Production
    People in the Capital Report on Special Agents
    Counter-revolutionaries Register with the Government One After Another, Surrendering Weapons, Reactionary Documents, and Confessing Their Crimes
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The promulgation of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries" has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the people in the capital for the struggle against special agents.
    The employees of various industrial and mining enterprises in the capital believe that the promulgation of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries" provides better guarantees for future production and construction. All employees of the 70th Ordnance Factory studied the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries." All workers in the factory expressed their willingness to contact the factory's security section at any time to report information. Jin Guicai, an old worker at the Electric Tram Repair Factory, said: "The year before last, we spent half a year building more than 50 trams, only to have them burned down by special agents. If we don't catch and severely punish the arsonist special agents, I won't be able to relieve the hatred in my heart. Now the government understands what's on our minds and promulgated these regulations, which truly represent our will." Workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant unanimously support the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries" because their production had previously been sabotaged by special agents. Workers in the power department of the Iron and Steel Plant said: "We were organizing competitions, but the special agents insisted on carrying out sabotage, causing us to have power outages and fail in the competitions." The People's Printing Factory and Xinhua Printing Factory did not have security groups in the past and are now starting to organize them. Workers at the forging workshop of the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory said: "Now we can produce with more peace of mind, and we must actively strengthen the struggle against special agents."
    The industrial and commercial circles in Beijing used the facts of their personal suffering from the devastation and persecution by special agents to illustrate the correctness of the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries. During the Kuomintang rule, the film industry suffered the most from the harassment and sabotage of special agents. At that time, the unified inspection team jointly formed by the puppet military police and security forces, under the pretext of maintaining the security of cinemas, demanded that the film industry trade union and the theater industry guild provide 800 gallons of gasoline, 200 gallons of machine oil, and several million yuan in miscellaneous expenses each month. However, Yang Yizhi, manager of the Daguangming Cinema, said: Since the liberation of Beijing, special agents have no longer dared to harass us, and we have been able to operate peacefully, which is unprecedented since the establishment of the cinema. Recently, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries," which we in the film industry firmly support because this provides even greater guarantees for our operations.
    The promulgation of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries" has had a profound impact on the citizens of the capital. According to the regulations, many citizens actively reported special agents who had committed heinous crimes. Feng Lengguang, a teacher at Datong Middle School, voluntarily reported Zhang Jinshun, a traitor and Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent, to the First Police Station of the First Sub-bureau, accusing Zhang of trampling on him and other masses, and demanded that the government suppress him. Zhang Zhiyuan, manager of Yiwentu Seal Shop, voluntarily reported a hidden puppet Kuomintang Bao head who oppressed and trampled on the masses to the police station. He reported the facts of this bandit's crimes in detail to the police station personnel. According to the staff of the First Police Station, after the promulgation of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries," four or five citizens have voluntarily reported special agents who trampled on them. On the afternoon of March 1st, when the Beijing Public Security Bureau escorted Wang Sudao, the "Commander of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Detachment," through Douya Hutong, Wang suddenly escaped. Yang Yongxing, a rickshaw puller, immediately pedaled his rickshaw to chase after him, grabbed Wang, and handed him over to the on-duty personnel of the Public Security Bureau.
    Under the pressure of the capital's people reporting in succession, some hidden counter-revolutionaries have had no choice but to register with the government or hand over hidden weapons, radio stations, and reactionary documents. For example, in the Changxindian Machinery Factory, 27 counter-revolutionary special agents registered within four days. One public security sub-bureau received 16 guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition within a week; one person turned in five pistols. Recently, special agents in custody have also turned in many pistols and other important materials. A Yiguandao point instructor handed over the "Book of Merit" and property such as silver dollars, cloth, and grain obtained through fraud. Some special agents and leaders of reactionary secret societies revealed crimes they had not confessed in the past and wrote supplementary materials.

　　肃清反革命才能安心生产
    首都人民检举特务
    反革命分子陆续向政府登记  交出武器反动证件坦白罪恶
    【本报讯】《惩治反革命条例》的公布，大大提高了首都人民反特务斗争的积极性。
    首都各工矿企业职工均认为《惩治反革命条例》的公布，使今后生产建设有了更好的保障。七十兵工厂全体职工都学习了《惩治反革命条例》。该厂全体工人表示要随时和本厂保安科联系，反映情况。电车修造厂的老工人金桂才说：“前年，我们花了半年的功夫，造了五十几辆电车，让特务一下子烧光。要不把放火的特务抓住严办，解不了我心里的仇恨。如今政府懂得我们的心事，颁布了这个条例，这真代表了我们的意志。”石景山发电厂和石景山钢铁厂的工人一致拥护《惩治反革命条例》，因为他们过去的生产曾遭受特务的破坏。钢铁厂动力部工人说：“咱们搞竞赛，特务们偏偏要进行破坏，使咱们发生停电事故，在竞赛中失败了。”人民印刷厂和新华印刷厂在过去没有安全小组，现正着手组织。长辛店铁路机厂锻工场工人说：“这一下，我们生产更安心了，更要积极地加强反特务的斗争。”
    北京市工商业界以亲身遭受特务摧残迫害的事实，说明了人民政府坚决镇压反革命的正确。在国民党统治时期，电影业受特务的骚扰破坏最甚。当时由伪军警宪联合组成的统一巡查组，他们借口维持影戏院的治安，每月要电影业同业工会和剧场业同业公会供给八百加仑汽油、二百加仑机器油和几百万元的杂费。但是，大光明电影院经理杨宜之说：北京解放以后，特务再也不敢骚扰我们，我们能够平安地营业了，这是影戏院成立以来从未有过的。最近中央人民政府又颁布了《惩治反革命条例》，我们电影业者坚决拥护。因为这使我们的营业更有了保障。
    《惩治反革命条例》的公布，在首都市民中发生了深刻影响。根据条例，很多市民积极地检举了罪大恶极的特务分子。大同中学教员冯冷光，自动向内一分局第一派出所检举汉奸、蒋匪特务张金顺，控诉张匪踏害他以及其他群众的罪恶，并要求政府予以镇压。益文图章店经理张志远，自动向派出所报告了暗藏着的一个欺压、踏害群众的伪国民党保长。并把这一匪徒的罪恶事实，详细地报告给派出所的人员。据第一派出所的工作人员谈：《惩治反革命条例》公布后，已有四、五户市民自动地报告了踏害过他们的特务分子。三月一日下午，北京市公安局押解“反共救国军支队司令”王素道经豆芽胡同时，王匪突然逃跑，三轮车工人杨永兴即急忙蹬起三轮车追赶，把王匪扭住，交给了公安局值勤人员。
    在首都人民纷纷检举的压力之下，一些暗藏的反革命分子已不得不向政府登记或交出隐藏的武器、电台和反动证物来。如长辛店机器厂，四天之内就有二十七名反革命特务分子进行了登记。有一个公安分局在一个星期内就收到交来的枪支十六支，子弹一千余发；其中有一个人交出了五支手枪。在押的特务最近也交出了手枪及其他重要材料很多。有的一贯道点传师又交出了“功德簿”和诈骗来的银元、布匹、粮食等财物。有些特务分子和反动会道门头子说出了过去没有坦白过的罪恶，写了补充材料。
