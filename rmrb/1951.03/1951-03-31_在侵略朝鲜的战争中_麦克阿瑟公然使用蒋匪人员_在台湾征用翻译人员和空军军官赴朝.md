Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: In the war of aggression against Korea, MacArthur has openly used Taiwanese Chiang Kai-shek bandit translators and air force personnel and is training a large number of translators in Taiwan. According to a New York Times Taipei dispatch on March 7th, twenty-two Taiwanese bandit translators secretly left Taiwan for Korea in two groups on February 4th and March 6th to serve as translators for the American invading forces in Korea. Six air force officers, disguised in civilian clothes, secretly left Taiwan for Korea on February 14th, specifically to prepare for the "interrogation" of air force personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The dispatch also stated that there are currently three hundred translators in Taiwan who were trained by the US and Chiang Kai-shek before Japan's surrender, and they will be successively conscripted and sent to MacArthur's headquarters for assignment. According to an Associated Press report from Taipei on February 16th, sixty Taiwanese bandit translators are receiving training in new weapons terminology from experts sent by MacArthur. The bandit Ministry of National Defense is continuing to recruit fifty-five translators to participate. Some of them may receive special training in preparation for "service in other regions" outside of Korea. The New York Times dispatch stated that MacArthur's headquarters is afraid of revealing the fact that it is using "Kuomintang forces to invade Korea," and has always tried to keep the above-mentioned transfer and training of translators and air force personnel a secret.
