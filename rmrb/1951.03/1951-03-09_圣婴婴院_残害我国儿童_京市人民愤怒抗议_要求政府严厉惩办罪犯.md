The infanticide at the "Holy Infant Infant Asylum" run by a Canadian "nun" in Guangzhou has aroused great indignation among the people of Beijing. Dr. Zhu Futang, Director of the Beijing Children's Hospital, pointed out: The infant mortality rate is indeed rare. Such "charitable" organizations have neither achieved any charitable cause, nor have they done any charitable act, nor do they have any compassion. They turn a blind eye to the deaths of so many children and are indifferent. This is not the behavior of a human being! Some people used to think that the "charitable" organizations run by foreigners were not bad, but who knew that the inside story was so dark. They used the name of "charitable" organizations to prevent the Chinese people from noticing their inhuman behavior. On the contrary, they thought that the imperialists were good people! Dr. Deng Jinjian, Deputy Director of the Children's Hospital, further pointed out that this cruel behavior of imperialism not only occurred in Guangzhou but also throughout China. There are many similar "charitable" organizations in Beijing. She urged the government to immediately investigate these so-called "charitable" organizations, deal with them appropriately, and protect our babies. Professor Qin Zhenting of Peking University Hospital also felt that we must not let this situation continue. He said: We are working hard for children's health, how can we allow imperialist elements to harm our children in this way. Kang Yingqu, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Peking University Hospital, said: The "charitable" undertakings carried out by imperialists in China are part of their policy of aggression against China. Zhang Jianhua, a technician in the Department of Pediatrics at Peking University Hospital, said even more indignantly: "We must not let American imperialism harm our second generation!" Doctors Wang Demin and Zuo Qihua of the department specifically pointed out: The children in the "Ren Ci Tang" in Xishiku in this city are also in the same environment. They are all malnourished, with haggard faces, and the mortality rate is also quite high. The children inside dare not talk to outsiders, and they are trembling when they see the nuns. A doctor from Peking University Hospital asked an orphan: Do many of your orphans die? He replied: "How can they not die!" But when the nun came, he dared not say another word.
    Zhu Sihui of the Air Force Command of North China wrote to this newspaper saying: The murderers of the "Holy Infant Infant Asylum" have lost their humanity. We do not allow imperialist elements to run wild on our land!
    The students of Tsinghua University were extremely indignant at the incident of imperialist elements harming our country's children in the "Holy Infant Infant Asylum". Zhou Yigang, a student in the Department of Philosophy, said: We will never allow such a thing to happen in the liberated New China! All the fourth-year students of the Department of Physics wrote a letter suggesting that the Tsinghua University Student Union suggest that the government immediately punish the murderers and thoroughly investigate all "charitable" undertakings run by imperialists in China. The students of Beijing Normal University expressed their opinions on the "Holy Infant Infant Asylum" incident, saying: Imperialist elements simply do not regard us as human beings; but they have forgotten that the Chinese people who have stood up have enough power to break their dog legs. All the students of the Department of Child Care of the school also issued a protest letter, lodging a serious protest against this heinous crime of the imperialist aggressors. The protest letter also made the following demands on the government: 1. Severely punish the dean, vice-dean, nuns and other five people of the hospital according to law; 2. Immediately give the hospital appropriate treatment; 3. Investigate all "charitable" childcare institutions run by foreigners inside and outside China as soon as possible, and immediately take appropriate measures to deal with and control them if similar situations are found. After reading the news "Canadian "Holy Infant Infant Asylum" in Guangzhou Harm Our Country's Children" published in this newspaper on March 7, the students of the 工学院 of North China University were so angry that they shouted in unison: Are these still human beings!? The students believe that this kind of "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton" "black shop" is completely a conspiracy of the imperialists to kill the Chinese people. The students suggested that the government: 1. Continue to investigate the matter and strictly inspect similar organizations of imperialism in our country; 2. Request the government to take over the hospital if possible. Students from the Agricultural University and the Affiliated Women's Middle School of Beijing Normal University also lodged serious protests against the "Holy Infant Infant Asylum" incident.

　　“圣婴婴院”残害我国儿童
    京市人民愤怒抗议
    要求政府严厉惩办罪犯
    广州一加拿大“修女”所主持的“圣婴婴院”虐杀我国婴儿事件，引起北京市人民极大的愤慨。北京市儿童医院院长诸福棠大夫指出：婴儿死亡率如此之高确是罕见。像这样的“慈善”机关既没有半点慈善事业的成就，也没有一点慈善的行为，更没有恻隐之心，眼看那么多的孩子死亡而熟视无睹，无动于中，这不是人的行为！以前有些人总以为外国人办的“慈善”机关总还不差，那里知道他的内幕竟如此黑暗。他们假借了“慈善”机关的名义，使中国人民不会觉察他那些惨无人道的行为，相反的，还以为帝国主义是好人！儿童医院副院长邓金鉴大夫更指出帝国主义这种残酷的行为不仅发生在广州而是遍于全中国。北京也就有不少类似的“慈善”机关。她要求政府立即追查这些所谓的“慈善”机关，予以适当的处理，保护我们的婴儿。北大医院秦振庭教授也觉得我们决不能让这种情形继续下去。他说：我们正为儿童健康而努力，岂能让帝国主义分子如此残害我国儿童。北大医院妇产科教授康映蕖说：帝国主义在中国举办“慈善”事业，是他们侵华政策中的一部分。北大医院小儿科技术员张剑华更愤激地说：“我们再不能让美帝国主义残害我们的第二代！”该科王德珉及左启华大夫更具体指出：本市西什库“仁慈堂”的孩子们也处在同样的环境中。他们都是营养不良，一个个面容憔悴，死亡率也相当高，里面的孩子不敢与外人说话，见了修女战战兢兢。北大医院大夫曾问他们一个孤儿说：你们孤儿死得多吗？回答说：“怎不死呀！”然而修女来了，他又不敢再说一句了。
    华北空军司令部朱思会致函本报说：“圣婴婴院”的凶手们已丧失了人性。我们不容许帝国主义分子在我们的土地上胡作妄为！
    清华大学的同学均为帝国主义分子在“圣婴婴院”残害我国儿童的事件愤慨万分。哲学系周裔纲同学说：我们决不容许在解放了的新中国，出现这种事情！物理系四年级全体同学写信建议清华大学学生会建议政府立即惩办凶手，并对帝国主义在华举办的一切“慈善”事业，予以彻底审查。北京师范大学的同学对“圣婴婴院”事件发表意见说：帝国主义分子根本不把我们当人看待；但是他们忘了，站起来了的中国人民，有足够的力量把他们的狗腿打断。该校保育系全体同学并发出抗议书，对帝国主义侵略者这一滔天罪行提出严重抗议。在抗议书中并对政府提出如下要求：一、对该院院长及副院长、修女等五人依法严惩；二、立即予该院以适当的处理；三、从速调查我国境内外籍人所主办的一切“慈善”性保育机关，如发现类似情形应立即加以适当处理与管制。华北大学工学院的同学读过本报三月七日发表的《广州加拿大“圣婴婴院”残害我国儿童》的消息后，大家怒不可止，齐声喊出：这还算人吗！？同学们认为这种“挂羊头卖狗肉”的“黑店”，完全是帝国主义者杀害中国人民的阴谋手段。同学们建议政府：一、继续查办该事，和严密检查帝国主义在我国的类似组织；二、要求政府在可能条件下接办该院。农业大学、北京师范大学附属女子中学的同学对“圣婴婴院”事件也提出了严重抗议。
