　　Resolutions and Statements Passed by the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference
　　Resolution on the Government Work Report and Future Work Guidelines
　　The first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, having listened to and discussed the Beijing Municipal People's Government's work report for 1950 with satisfaction, believes that significant progress and achievements have been made in all aspects of the government's work over the past year. It has not only completed but also exceeded the original plan in many areas, which fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system.
　　In order to further consolidate and develop the various constructions of the people's capital, the conference unanimously supports the eight work guidelines and tasks for 1951 proposed by Chairman Peng Zhen of the Municipal Consultative Committee, and calls on the 2.2 million people of the city to unite more closely, under the leadership of the newly elected Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and the Municipal People's Government Committee, to work together to overcome difficulties and strive to complete these tasks.
　　Resolution on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
　　The first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference fully agrees with the report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries by Deputy Director Feng Jiping of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and calls on the people of the city to unanimously support and assist the government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, eliminating counter-revolutionary remnants, and eradicating bandits, habitual bandits, despots, spies, and leaders of reactionary secret societies, to further consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital, ensure the smooth progress of various constructions in the capital, and protect the safety of the people's lives and property.
　　Statement on Opposing the United States Arming Japan
　　For the past fifty years, China has continuously suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialists. The people of Beijing suffered first from the ravages of the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and experienced eight years of enslavement and oppression, enduring all kinds of disasters and sufferings. Therefore, we cannot but express our serious protest against the actions of American imperialism, which is actively engaged in a unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. We believe that this sinful act of American imperialism is a serious threat to the Chinese people and the greatest harm to the safety and interests of the Chinese people. Therefore, the 2.2 million people of our city, together with the people of the whole country, are determined to fight to smash this aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.
