Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The Overseas Chinese Federation has issued a statement protesting the Philippine reactionary government's increasingly intensified atrocities against overseas Chinese. The full text is as follows:

The Philippine reactionary government, a lackey of American imperialism, has turned the islands, large and small, of the Philippines into a terrifying prison of death. The 180,000 overseas Chinese living in the abyss of misery for a long time are in an increasingly dangerous situation under the Philippine reactionary government's increasingly intensified barbaric policy of destroying overseas Chinese.

In recent times alone: The Philippine reactionary government has unscrupulously sent our innocent compatriots to Taiwan to be slaughtered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. According to a report by the Associated Press on January 13th, "Six Chinese were deported to Taiwan by the Philippine government." The Associated Press also feigned ignorance and speculated that "they may all have been sentenced to death."

Last year, Luo Deliyi, the Philippine consul in Hong Kong, openly clamored at a press conference to send 20,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines to Taiwan, and shamelessly stated that this bestial action had been discussed in detail with the so-called Philippine ambassador of the Chiang bandits.

Large-scale arrests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines are becoming more and more rampant. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents not only provide "blacklists" but also openly collude with the henchmen of the Philippine reactionary government to persecute overseas Chinese, searching, arresting, extorting, and resorting to all kinds of extreme measures. Zhou Shukai, a counselor of the Chiang bandit gang's puppet embassy in the Philippines, even arrogantly admitted: "The embassy designated Huang Wenhai and Song Shanshou to accompany the search, and satisfactory results were obtained." According to a telegram from the puppet Central News Agency on July 1st last year, "Two thousand Chinese nationals in the Philippines were arrested. In the week or so before February 16th this year, 500 people were arrested in Manila and the provinces of Luzon."

The Philippine reactionary government is frantically expanding concentration camps. According to the "Overseas Chinese Commercial News" on December 13th last year, 4,000 overseas Chinese have been detained on an isolated island, completely isolated from the outside world, living a life in hell.

The Philippine Congress even more barbarously passed a reactionary bill to conscript all able-bodied overseas Chinese to Korea to be cannon fodder for the American imperialists' expanding war of aggression. The various anti-Chinese "laws" adopted by the Philippine reactionary government are truly endless. For example, in the city of Basilan, more than 400 overseas Chinese families were forced to become unemployed under the reactionary measures of the so-called "Philippinization of vegetable markets." As for stopping remittances, prohibiting imports, destroying culture, framing and intimidating, etc., there are too many to mention.

It must be pointed out that all these heinous crimes of the Philippine reactionary government in persecuting overseas Chinese are entirely carried out under the instigation of the United States and in collusion with the remnants of the Chiang bandits. Especially after the United States launched the war of aggression against Taiwan and Korea and suffered a decisive defeat, the Philippine reactionary government has further exposed its slavish face of currying favor with its master.

We want to solemnly declare that we, all overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country, will never tolerate the Philippine reactionary government's increasingly intensified maltreatment and massacre of our compatriots. We are determined to wage a long-term and effective struggle against the atrocities of the Philippine reactionary government and the remnants of the Chiang bandits, the running dogs of American imperialism, in cruelly persecuting our compatriots!

### 华侨联谊会发表声明抗议菲政府迫害华侨

　　华侨联谊会发表声明抗议菲政府迫害华侨
    【新华社十三日讯】华侨联谊会为反对菲律宾反动政府变本加厉地迫害华侨的暴行，发表声明。全文如下：
    美帝国主义的仆从——菲律宾反动政府，已把菲律宾大小岛屿，制造成一座恐怖死亡的监狱。长期生活在水深火热中的十八万旅菲华侨，在菲律宾反动政府日益加紧摧残华侨的野蛮政策下，处境是愈加险恶了。
    单就最近来说：菲律宾反动政府肆无忌惮地将我无辜侨胞，不断地送往台湾，供蒋介石匪帮屠杀。仅据合众社一月十三日一次的报道，即有“六名华人被菲律宾政府遣送至台湾。”美联社还假装不知的推测说：“彼等可能皆被判处死刑。”
    去年菲律宾驻港领事罗得力依在记者招待会上曾公开叫嚣，要将两万旅菲华侨送往台湾，并无耻地表示：此一兽性行动已与蒋匪残余的所谓驻菲大使详细磋商过了的。
    菲律宾大规模的逮捕华侨的事件，愈演愈剧。蒋匪特务不仅提供“黑名单”，并公开地和菲律宾反动政府的爪牙一道迫害侨胞，搜查、逮捕、敲诈勒索，无所不用其极。蒋匪帮驻菲律宾的伪使馆参事周匪书楷：竟狂妄地供认：“使馆派定馆员黄文海及宋山寿陪同搜查，皆获满意之结果。”据伪中央社去年七月一日的电报，即有“两千个在菲律宾的中国侨民被捕。今年二月十六日以前一个多星期中在马尼拉和吕宋各省即有五百人被捕。”
    菲律宾反动政府疯狂地扩充集中营。据去年十二月十三日《华侨商报》透露：已有四千华侨被拘留在一个孤岛上，完全与外界隔绝，过着人间地狱的岁月。
    菲律宾国会更蛮横地通过一项反动议案，征召全部华侨壮丁送到朝鲜，做美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的炮灰。菲律宾反动政府所采取的种种排华“法案”，真是层出不穷。例如巴西一市，我侨胞在所谓“菜市菲化案”的反动措施下，即有四百余家被迫失业。至于停止侨汇、禁止入口、摧残文化、栽赃吓诈等等，更是罄竹难书。
    必须指出：菲律宾反动政府这一切迫害华侨的滔天罪行，完全是在美国的驱策下与蒋匪残余勾结进行的。特别是在美国发动侵略台湾、朝鲜的战争而遭到决定性的失败之后，菲律宾反动政府更加暴露了诌媚主子的奴才面目。
    我们要郑重声明：我们全体华侨以及全国人民，决不能容忍菲律宾反动政府对我侨胞变本加厉的虐待与屠杀。我们坚决为反对美帝国主义的走狗——菲律宾反动政府和蒋匪残余残酷迫害我侨胞的暴行，作持久有效的斗争！
