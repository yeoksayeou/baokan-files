　　Reading Frontline Dispatches from Korea
      Jie Yuzhen
    Recently, many dispatches reflecting the Korean War have appeared in newspapers and magazines. Some are very moving works. Whether exposing the crimes, fragility, and embarrassment of the American invaders in Korea, or praising the bravery, strength, wisdom, and close unity of the Chinese and Korean people's fighters, or reflecting the bravery and enthusiasm of the people supporting the front, as well as the various struggles of the guerrillas and unarmed masses against the enemy, generally speaking, they all possess fresh, lively, and refined characteristics. Because the works have a sense of reality and fresh images, they can make readers feel as if they are on the scene, sharing the feelings and breathing with the protagonists. The role played in enhancing the patriotic and internationalist feelings of the masses, and the role played in the ideological education of hating, despising, and scorning the enemy, cannot be compared with some literary works that start from concepts and fabricate characters and events out of thin air.

    Du Gao's "China, Korea, and Hungary Embrace Together," published in this newspaper on February 17, describing the common will and actions of the people of China, Korea, and Hungary to defend peace and resist aggression, is a very good, vivid, and deeply moving internationalist teaching material.

    This dispatch, through vivid descriptions of the Chinese and Korean fighters struggling hard for a common purpose, their close care for each other, the love and gratitude of young Korean girls for the Volunteers, the love of Volunteer soldier Wang Huaiduo for Korean little girls, etc., very truthfully and powerfully tells the reader: The feelings of the Chinese and Korean people are so solid that nothing can break them. These realistic descriptions tell the reader a truth: Our emotions are developed and consolidated in the common goal, fighting side by side, and are indestructible.

    Throughout the article, there is no direct description of how the Hungarian people helped Korea, or how these medicines saved the wounded; but we can see from Political Commissar Zhang's instructions to the soldiers who undertook the transportation task, Wang Huaiduo and Comrade Lao Jin's hard work, wisdom, heroic actions and their thoughts and feelings in order to complete this task, the thirteen-year-old Korean girl's use of her life to exchange for the safety of the medicines, etc., how great an impact the help of the Hungarian people has had on the brotherly countries in Asia.

    Allow me to copy a few simple, yet moving, refined and vivid descriptions here.

    "Wang Huaiduo stared hatefully at the burning medicines in front of him. The fire grew bigger and bigger, and more and more bullets fell. He stood up, took off his coat, and rushed towards the fire. He shouted loudly: 'Comrades! Rescue! If the medicine is burned, what face will we have to see the Hungarian people?'"

    "Lao Jin and the driver also rushed over regardless. At this time, the child suddenly leaned over the two wooden boxes next to her and hugged them tightly with her hands!"

    After the enemy plane flew away, an unusually real, unusually vivid, and unusually moving scene appeared.

    "When fifty-six boxes of medicine were safely moved onto the car, next to the car, on the two intact medicine boxes, lay the child's body quietly. Her back was facing the sky, and on her back, there were five bullet holes, fresh blood gushing out, soaking her clothes, and flowing all the way to the wooden box. Her hands tightly hugged the box like embracing the Hungarian people; she still had a piece of unchewed dry food in her mouth..."

    From this refined and very vivid description, we can see the unyielding fighters, and we can also see the unyielding people. Because even the weak children already understand what hate is, what love is, and what is more important than life.

    The reason why the work is so moving is mainly not due to the author's skillful technique, but to the authenticity of the subject matter, and the ability to select and process the subject matter, especially the patriotic and internationalist ideological feelings that burn from the reality of life.

    Other dispatches, such as Yang Shuo's "Another Battle on the Korean Front," Li Zhuang's "Flames of Revenge," Ding Fan and Dai Qingyu's "Ordinary People," and the collective writing of frontline reporters and correspondents of the Xinhua News Agency, "So-called American Imperialist 'Ace' Troops" ... their themes, subject matter, and writing styles each have their own characteristics. And they all have a common characteristic—there are no pretentious tricks, but they concentrate vivid facts and give readers a very strong sense of reality.

    We urgently hope that writers will create more works with a sense of reality like these dispatches from the front, and use this kind of work to replace those "creations" that start from concepts and cannot convince readers.

　　读朝鲜前线通讯
      解驭珍
    近来在报纸和刊物上，出现了许多反映朝鲜抗战的通讯。有些是十分感人的作品。不论是暴露美国侵略者在朝鲜的罪恶暴行，脆弱和狼狈，不论是歌颂中朝人民战士的英勇、坚强、智慧与亲密的团结关系，不论是反映人民支援前线的勇敢、积极，以及游击队和非武装群众与敌人的各种斗争，一般地说，都具备着新鲜、活泼、精炼的特色。由于作品有真实感，形象新鲜，所以能够使读者仿佛身历其境，与主人公共感受，共呼吸。在提高群众的爱国主义与国际主义的情感上所起的作用，在仇视、鄙视、蔑视敌人的思想教育上所起的作用，决不是某些从概念出发、凭空杜撰人物和事件的文艺作品所能比拟的。
    二月十七日杜高同志在本报上发表的“中国、朝鲜、匈牙利拥抱在一起”，描写中国、朝鲜、匈牙利三国人民保卫和平反抗侵略的共同意志和行动，是一篇很好的、生动的、感人至深的国际主义的教材。
    这篇通讯，通过关于中朝战士为了共同目的艰苦斗争，他们彼此的亲密关怀，年幼的朝鲜女孩对志愿军的热爱、感激，志愿军战士王怀铎对朝鲜小女孩的热爱等等场面生动的描写，非常真实地，有力地告诉了读者：中朝人民的感情，就是这样的坚实，任何东西也不能打破它。这些富有真实感的描写，告诉读者一个真理：我们的情感，是在共同的目标下，并肩作战中，发展和巩固起来的，颠扑不破的。
    全文里面，没有正面地描写匈牙利人民如何援助朝鲜，和这些药品如何救治了伤员；但是我们可以从张政委对于担负运输任务的战士的叮嘱，王怀铎与老金同志为了完成这一任务所表现的艰苦的智慧的英勇的行动及其思想情感，十三岁的朝鲜女孩子用生命来换取药品的安全等等情节，表现匈牙利人民的帮助在亚洲兄弟国家里产生了多么大的影响。
    容我在这儿抄录几句虽然平易，却很动人的精练而又形象的描写。
    “王怀铎仇恨地望着前面燃烧的药品。火越来越大，子弹也越落越多。他站起来，脱下自己的大衣朝火堆扑了过去。一边大声地喊着：‘同志们！抢救呀！药品烧了，我们还有什么脸见匈牙利人民呢？’”
    “老金和司机也不顾一切地跟着扑了过去。孩子在这个时候，一下俯在她旁边的两个木箱子上，用手紧紧地把它们抱了起来！”
    敌机飞走以后，出现了一段异常真实、异常生动、异常感人的场面。
    “当五十六箱药品平安地搬上汽车的时候，在车的旁边，在两只完整无损的药品箱子上，静静地躺着孩子的尸体。她的背朝天，在背上面，有五个子弹的窟窿，鲜血冒了出来，浸透了她的衣裳，一直流到木箱子上。她的手紧紧地抱住箱子像拥抱着匈牙利人民；她的嘴里还咬了一块没有咀嚼的干粮。……”
    从这一段精练而又十分形象的描写里面，我们可以看见不屈的战士，也可以看见不屈的人民。因为连稚弱的孩子都已懂得什么是恨，什么是爱，什么是比生命更重要的东西。
    作品所以如此感动人的原因，主要不在于作者的技巧的熟练，而在于题材的真实，和对于选择题材处理题材的能力，特别是从生活实际当中所燃烧起来的爱国主义与国际主义的思想感情。
    其它的通讯，如像杨朔的《朝鲜前线的另一种战斗》，李庄的《复仇的火焰》，丁帆、戴庆余的《平凡的人》，新华社前线记者通讯员集体写作的《如此美帝“王牌”军》……其主题、题材、文章形式都各有各的特点。而它们都有一个共同的特点——没有矫揉造作的花样，但却把生动的事实集中了起来，给予读者以很强烈的真实感。
    我们迫切希望文艺家们创作出更多的如同前方的这些通讯那样有真实感的作品，用这种作品来代替那些不能说服读者的从概念出发的“创作”。
