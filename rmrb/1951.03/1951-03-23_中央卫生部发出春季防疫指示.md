　　Central Ministry of Health Issues Spring Epidemic Prevention Instructions

    In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in a timely manner and protect the people's health, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued the "Spring Epidemic Prevention Instructions" to health administrative organs at all levels across the country on the 18th, requiring all localities to earnestly implement them.

    According to the ministry's investigation: Recently, the most prevalent epidemic diseases nationwide are measles and smallpox. Diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhus, and relapsing fever have occurred in a few places. Cases of plague have begun to appear in Fujian and Guangdong. The ministry believes that these infectious diseases can be prevented and deaths can be reduced; governments at all levels must be vigilant and immediately lead prevention work to avoid serious losses.

    Regarding the specific work of spring epidemic prevention, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government instructed all localities to conscientiously report epidemics and promptly prevent and eradicate infectious diseases. Governments at all levels should make in-depth arrangements based on the epidemic prevention and health work of 1950. For example, in cities, ten-household health group leaders, street health committee members, and street section responsible doctors can be established. In rural areas, ten-household health group leaders, village health committee members, and district health assistants can be established, responsible for reporting epidemics and forming a grassroots epidemic reporting network. This will allow for the timely detection and prevention of infectious diseases, and control their spread. After obtaining information about an epidemic, the county or district administrative or responsible health institutions should quickly send personnel or organize local private practicing doctors to conduct investigations and diagnoses, isolate and treat patients on the spot, and disinfect at any time; at the same time, they should report to higher levels, investigate the source of infection, conduct necessary health isolation of contacts; and in conjunction with the local government, conduct publicity on individual infectious diseases, relying on the masses to carry out immunization, general sanitation campaigns, and environmental sanitation prevention and control work. If the county's epidemic prevention force is insufficient, it can ask the special commissioner's office or the province to send epidemic prevention personnel to assist, and should not ignore it and allow it to spread naturally.

    The instructions emphasized that these prevention works must be valued administratively, urging the subordinate health authorities to make timely and perfect arrangements. More importantly, after the work is arranged, personnel should be dispatched regularly for inspection, so as to discover problems at any time and guide solutions in a timely manner; and prevent the situation where the work is arranged but then put aside and not implemented. Only in this way can the completion of the work tasks be guaranteed.

　　中央卫生部发出春季防疫指示
    为及时防止传染病的流行，保障人民健康，中央人民政府卫生部于十八日向全国各级卫生行政机关发出《春季防疫指示》，要求各地切实执行。
    据该部调查：最近全国各地疫病以麻疹、天花为最多。白喉、猩红热、斑疹伤寒、回归热则在少数地方发生。福建、广东开始有鼠疫病例。该部认为：这些传染病都是有办法预防并可减少死亡的；各级政府必须警惕，即时领导进行预防工作，以免造成严重的损失。
    关于春季防疫的具体工作，中央人民政府卫生部指示各地认真地作疫情报告，及时地防治与扑灭传染病。各级政府应就一九五○年防疫卫生工作的基础作深入的布置。例如在城市中可建立十户卫生小组长、街卫生委员、街段责任医师。在农村中可建立十户卫生小组长、村卫生委员、区卫生助理，负责报告疫情，构成基层的疫情报告网。这样便可作到对传染病的及时发现、及时防治，并可控制其流行。在获得疫情后，县、区行政上或主管卫生机构应迅速派员或组织当地私人开业医生进行调查诊断，就地隔离治疗，随时消毒；同时要向上级报告，调查传染来源，对接触者进行必要的健康隔离；并结合当地政府就个别传染病进行宣传，依靠群众来进行预防接种、一般的清洁卫生运动及环境卫生等防治工作。如县的防疫力量不够时，可请专署或省派防疫人员协助，不可置之不理，任其自然蔓延。
    指示强调称：这些预防工作，须由行政上加以重视，督促所属卫生机关及时地作完善的布置。更重要的是在工作布置后，应经常派员检查，以便随时发现问题，即时指导解决；并防止在工作布置后下面搁置不行。这样才能保证工作任务的完成。
