Some Experiences in Cotton Pre-Purchase Contracts
    Wang Xiongshi Jin Xibin

    I. Overview of Cotton Pre-Purchase Contract Implementation in 1950

    In the spring of 1950, cooperative societies in parts of Northeast and North China, in order to alleviate cotton farmers' concerns about planting cotton, responded to the government's call to expand cotton fields and increase cotton production by engaging in cotton pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers. These contracts took the following two forms:

    First, credit-based pre-purchase contracts. These contracts were signed between local village cooperatives and small producers—farmers—before cotton planting. The main purpose was to alleviate farmers' concerns about not being able to sell their cotton if they planted too much. The contract only clearly stated that the cooperative was responsible for guaranteeing the sale of cotton products at a cotton-grain price ratio and for regulating the supply of grain. Producers guaranteed planting area and estimated yield. Before the cotton harvest, there was only a credit-based agreement between the two parties, with no exchange of materials or funds. For example, the Lucheng County Cooperative in Shanxi Province signed pre-purchase contracts with thirty-two village cooperatives (which then signed with farmers). Nanmazhuang village, using this form, increased its cotton planting area from 70 mu in 1949 to 250 mu after signing contracts, playing a significant role in expanding cotton field area.

    Second, in-kind loan pre-purchase contracts. This form of contract can be further divided into the following four types due to the different sources of materials and the length of the pre-purchase period: (1) Pre-purchase contracts using materials loaned by specialized institutions. The Pingyuan Province Cotton Improvement Society's branches used cotton specialized loans combined with public or local grain from the finance department to pre-purchase more than 860,000 jin of seed cotton. (2) Pre-purchase contracts using materials from state-owned companies. In some cotton-growing areas of Northeast China, some farmers suffered from grain shortages due to floods in 1949, and the masses had difficulty obtaining grain, so they were willing to grow more food crops; others did not have a sufficient understanding of the government's policy of encouraging cotton planting, fearing that they would not be able to sell their cotton if they planted too much, or that they would not get a good price or be able to exchange it for grain, etc. To eliminate these concerns and alleviate the difficulties in the masses' lives and production materials, the trade department allocated a total of 19,140 tons of grain to the three provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe, as well as Anshan, Lushun, and Dalian cities, for cotton pre-purchase. (3) Pre-purchase contracts using cooperatives' own funds or sales promotion and pre-purchase contracts using financial reserves. For example, the Wu'an County Cooperative in Hebei Province used this form in conjunction with 200,000 jin of grain from its own funds and 400,000 jin of financial reserves to sign contracts with farmers for pre-purchase, which not only stimulated cotton planting but also developed more than a dozen new village cooperatives.

    According to incomplete statistics from Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, under the above-mentioned forms, cooperatives used their own funds and utilized grain companies, government public grain, materials, etc., to pre-purchase a total of 1,811,456 jin of seed cotton and 3,155,081 jin of ginned cotton. The materials loaned out through cotton pre-purchase included 24,602,864 jin of grain, 10,476,835 jin of bean cake, and 5,058,736 jin of coal. This not only laid a favorable foundation for cooperatives to implement contract management but also played a significant role in stimulating mass cotton planting. Many people believed that signing a contract was like buying an insurance policy. People in Shanxi said: "Sign a contract in spring and deliver cotton in autumn, see if I plant cotton or not." This shows the masses' support for pre-purchase contracts. At the same time, it also solved the masses' difficulties in lacking grain and fertilizer. Because the contract stipulates the specifications, it can also make the masses consciously improve the quality of cotton, so it should be continued to be promoted in 1951.

            II. Some Experiences in Implementing Pre-Purchase Contracts

    First, credit and material pre-purchase contracts should be promoted separately according to different situations. According to the experience of Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, in implementing cotton pre-purchase, the credit-based pre-purchase contract is effective and can be universally promoted based on the current conditions of the state-owned economy and grassroots cooperatives. Because it not only guarantees the purchase and a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio, eliminating cotton farmers' concerns about not being able to sell cotton or not getting a good price. At the same time, it provides many conveniences for state-owned trading institutions, which can prepare materials and funds for purchase in a planned manner according to the contract, and eliminate the opportunity for some merchants to manipulate cotton prices. Therefore, the credit-based pre-purchase contract can be widely promoted. Material pre-purchase has also achieved great results, but it must be implemented in accordance with existing conditions. When there are difficulties in material adjustment, it is possible to try the pre-purchase method of signing a contract first and allocating appropriate materials in installments. In disaster areas and breeding areas of improved varieties, the method of material pre-purchase should be emphasized. In addition, regardless of the form of pre-purchase, it should be carried out before cotton planting, so as to cooperate with the government's overall cotton production increase plan and achieve a successful completion.

    Second, the relationship between direct contracts (implementation contracts) and general contracts. The contract signed by the cooperative and the national trade organization for the exchange of materials and cotton is called the general contract. The pre-purchase contract signed by the village cooperative and the farmer or production team is called the direct contract or the implementation contract. In the management of cotton pre-purchase contracts, the cooperative must, on the one hand, negotiate funds with the cotton purchase agency from top to bottom, and at the same time combine the existing materials of the grain and department store company to sign a general pre-purchase contract; on the other hand, it must directly sign an implementation contract with cotton farmers or production teams from the bottom up. Only in this way can the upper and lower level businesses be consistent, so that the contract of one party will not fail, and the organized exchange of urban and rural materials will be promoted. Therefore, the general contract and the direct contract are inseparable. The relationship between the upper and lower levels cannot be partially disconnected, and must be closely connected layer by layer in order to do a good job.

    Third, how to stipulate the pre-purchase price. After a large number of new cottons are on the market, that is, the period when cotton farmers end their contractual responsibilities, sometimes due to objective conditions, the market price and the stipulated price ratio may not be exactly the same. If the ratio is rigidly stipulated in the contract early, it will prolong the end period of the contract, or affect the quality of the pre-purchased products, and even lead to mass dissatisfaction, burying hidden dangers for the development of the contract system. For example, some cooperatives in Pingyuan Province stipulated in the contract in the spring of 1950 that eight jin of millet would be exchanged for one jin of standard ginned cotton, but when the new cotton was on the market, the price of cotton always exceeded eight jin to some extent, making it difficult to recover the cotton. On the contrary, the pre-purchase contract of Wu'an County Cooperative in Hebei Province stipulates that the cotton and rice will be converted and returned at the current price after autumn (that is, the price of the state-owned company), and the masses are satisfied, so there is no such difficulty. However, this needs to be clearly stated in the general contract. In addition, if the state-owned economy has surplus capacity and cotton farmers have difficulties during the lean season, and in combination with the actual situation of the cooperative, it is also possible to distribute food, daily industrial products, or fertilizers and farm tools to the members in installments.

    Fourth, avoid formalistic contracts. The meaning of the contract must be based on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit. In addition to the general contract, the district and village cooperatives must first sign a contract with the masses or production team based on the actual situation, and then sign it level by level upwards, otherwise it will become an administrative order or apportionment task. It is easy for the county federation of cooperatives to sign a contract with district and village cadres to form a formalistic blank contract. The key to extensively carrying out the signing and implementation of contracts lies in the basic contract between the village cooperative and the production team or farmers (such as credit contracts should be signed with members, and materials using state funds can be signed regardless of whether they are members or non-members). If the village cooperative does not sign a contract with the group or farmers, all pre-purchases are empty.

    Fifth, inspection work after the contract is signed. In order to give full play to the effectiveness of the contract, inspection work is an indispensable part. Therefore, after the contract is signed, the county, district, and village cooperative cadres must conduct in-depth inspections to understand the cotton production situation and ensure good harvests and delivery on time. In addition, it is also necessary to prevent the "misappropriation," "relief," or "speculation" of funds or materials pre-paid under the contract, which will affect the development of the pre-purchase contract system. For example, in Shaotai Village, Dingtao, Pingyuan Province, a widow who did not grow cotton also borrowed pre-purchase grain of thirty jin of seed cotton. There were as many as ten households in the village in similar situations, which was due to the neglect of inspection work, which led to many difficulties in receiving cotton.

　　关于棉花预购合同的几点经验介绍
    汪雄时　金熙彬
    一、一九五零年执行棉花预购合同的概况
    一九五○年春季东北、华北部分地区的合作社，为了解除棉农植棉的顾虑，响应政府扩大棉田增加棉产的号召进行了和棉农订立棉花预购合同的工作，其形式可分为下列两种：
    第一、信用形式的预购合同。这种合同是在棉花播种前，由当地村合作社和小生产者——农民签订的。主要是为解除农民怕种多了棉花卖不出的顾虑。合同内只明确记载产品棉花由社方负责按棉粮比价保证推销，和调剂供应粮食，生产者保证种植面积与估收产量，在棉花收获前双方仅有信用的契约，并没有物资或款项的交换。如山西省潞城县社与三十二个村社订立了预购合同（村社再与农民订立），南马庄利用这种形式在经过订合同后，由一九四九年全村只种棉花七○亩增种到二五○亩，在扩大棉田面积上起了很大作用。
    第二、实物贷放形式的预购合同。这种形式的合同由于实物的来源不同及预购期间的长短，又可分为下列四种：（一）利用专业机构物资贷放的预购合同。在平原省棉业改进社的各分社就是利用棉花专业贷款并结合财政上的公粮或地方粮，共预购了八十六万多斤籽棉。（二）利用国营公司物资的预购合同。在东北曾有部分棉区由于一九四九年遭受水灾，粮食歉收，群众吃粮困难，因之都愿多种粮食作物；另有部分农民对政府奖励植棉政策，认识不够，怕种多了卖不出去，卖不上好价钱或换不回粮食等等看法。为消除这种顾虑，及解除群众生活及生产资料的困难，于是由贸易部门拨给辽东、辽西、热河三省及鞍山、旅顺大连等市，共计粮食一万九千一百四十吨，进行了棉花预购。（三）利用合作社自有资金或售品推销的预购合同及利用财政存粮的预购合同，如河北省武安县合作社用这种形式结合来作的，社本身以自有资金二十万斤粮结合四十万斤财政存粮与农民实行订约预购，不但刺激了植棉，更发展了十几个新村社。
    据河北、平原二省的不完全统计，在上列的几种形式下合作社以自有资金并利用粮食公司、政府公粮、物资等共预购了籽棉一、八一一、四五六斤，皮棉三、一五五、○八一斤，由预购棉花贷出的实物计有粮食二四、六○二、八六四斤，豆饼一○、四七六、八三五斤，煤炭五、○五八、七三六斤，不仅在合作社实行合同经营方式上奠定了有利的基础，在刺激群众植棉上亦发生了很大作用。许多群众认为订了合同就是打了保险票。山西群众讲：“春订合同秋交花，看我种花不种花”。可见群众对预购合同的拥护。同时也解决了群众缺粮缺肥的困难。因合同上规定了规格，也可使群众自觉的提高棉花品质，因此一九五一年应继续推广。
            二、执行预购合同中的几点体验
    第一、信用与实物的预购合同应结合不同情况分别推行。根据山西省潞城县执行棉花预购的经验来分析，信用形式的预购合同效用显著，而且根据目前国营经济与基层合作社的条件，可以普遍推行。因为他不仅保证了收购及合理的棉粮比价，解除了棉农怕有棉卖不出或卖不上好价的顾虑。同时给予国营贸易机构许多方便，可以按照合同有计划的准备物资款项收购，杜绝了某些商人操纵棉价的机会，因此信用方式的预购合同是可以广泛推行的，实物预购，成绩亦大，但得配合现有条件执行。在物资调剂有困难时，可试行先订约和分期拨付适当物资的预购办法。在灾区及良种繁殖区，应着重推行实物预购办法。此外勿论何种方式预购，都应该在棉花播种前来进行，这样才能配合政府总的棉花增产计划，得以胜利完成。
    第二、直接合同（执行合同）与总合同的关系。合作社与国家贸易机构订立的物资与棉花交换的契约，我们称为总合同，村社与农民或生产小组订的预购契约，我们称为直接合同或执行合同，合作社在棉花预购合同的经营方式上，必须一方面要由上而下的和棉花收购机构协定资金，同时结合粮食百货公司的现物而订立总的预购合同；另一方面要由下而上的与棉农或生产小组直接签订执行合同，这样才能使上下级业务衔接一致，不致使某一方的合同落空，更促使了城乡物资走上有组织的交流。所以总合同与直接合同是分不开的，由上而下由下而上各级关系机构间不能局部脱节，必须一层层的紧密衔接起来，才能搞好。
    第三、预购价格怎样的规定。新花大量上市后，也就是棉农结束合同责任的时期，有时因为客观的条件，造成市价与规定比价不能尽然相同，如果早在合同内硬性的规定了比值，多少就会延长合同的结束期间，或影响预购产品的品质，甚至也会酿成群众不满，给合同制的发展，埋下了阻碍的恶果。如平原省有些合作社在一九五○年春季订合同时，订好了八斤小米折还一斤标准皮棉，但至新花上市后，棉花价格总是多少超过了八斤，因此使收回棉花困难。反之如河北省武安县社的预购合同内是规定在秋后棉米各按时价折合归还（即国营公司的牌价），群众都认为满意，就没有这种困难了，但这是需要在总合同内详为注明的。此外，如果在青黄不接之际，国营经济有余力，棉农有困难时，并结合合作社的实际情况，亦可部分的分期向社员配售食粮，日用工业品或肥料农具等的办法。
    第四、避免形式主义的合同。合同的意义是必须建立在自愿两利的基础上，除总合同外，区、村社必须根据实际情况先与群众或生产小组订约，然后再逐级往上订立，否则就会变成行政命令或摊派任务。由县联社与区村干部订合同是容易形成形式主义的空白合同的。广泛开展订合同和实现合同的关键，在于村社与生产小组或农户的基本合约（如信用合同应和社员订立，如利用国家资金的实物都可不分社员与非社员），如村社没有和小组或农户订立，一切预购是空的。
    第五、合同订立后的检查工作。为了发挥合同的效能，检查工作是万不可忽略的一环。因此订合同之后的县、区、村社干部必须深入进行检查，了解棉花生产情况，保证有良好收获与到期交货。此外并要防止把合同预支的款项或物资“挪用”“救济”或“投机”等行为，而影响预购合同制度的发展。如平原省定陶邵台村，有一孀妇没种棉花，也贷到三十斤籽棉的预购粮，类此的情况，该村即有十户之多，就是因为忽视了检查工作，以致在收花时遇到很多困难。
