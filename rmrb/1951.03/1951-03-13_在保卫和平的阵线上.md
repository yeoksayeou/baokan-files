　　On the Front Lines of Defending Peace

　　Italian youth have established the National Youth Federation and scheduled a "Youth Day for the Defense of Peace" to be held across the country on the 18th, to promote the World Peace Council's resolutions on the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers and on opposing the arming of West Germany. Twenty-two thousand local peace committees have been established throughout Italy. In the small town of Santa Maria di Mugnano in the province of Modena, peace committees have been established on every street.

　　Working people in the Netherlands have held meetings to discuss the resolutions of the World Peace Council and enthusiastically support the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. Peace fighters in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and other cities have launched a signature campaign for the declaration of a peace pact.

　　The Swedish Peace Defense Conference was held in Stockholm, the capital, on the 3rd and 4th. The conference decided to launch a nationwide campaign to collect signatures for the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact, and adopted eight peace proposals, including advocating a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; resolving the Far East issue through negotiations between the countries concerned, including the return of Taiwan to China and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan after the eradication of militarism; convening a conference of the five major powers to conclude a peace pact; opposing the arming of West Germany; and stopping the arms race.

　　The Bulgarian Union of Scientific Workers issued a statement in support of the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, urging scientists around the world, especially scientists in the United States, Britain, and France, to rise up to defend peace, and to widely publicize the peace pact to the people of their respective countries.
