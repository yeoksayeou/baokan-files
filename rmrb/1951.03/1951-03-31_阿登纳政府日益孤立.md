　　Xinhua News Agency, March 27th:

　　The Adenauer government's policy of actively rearming West Germany under the aegis of American imperialism, thereby plunging the West German economy into dire straits, has caused the Adenauer government to be subjected to increasingly fierce opposition from the West German people, and has increasingly isolated it politically.

　　At a recent meeting of the Bonn parliament, Bonn's Minister of Economic Affairs Erhard requested an additional 7 to 9 billion marks in taxes annually to raise funds for military production. To this end, he proposed to restrict consumption, raise agricultural product prices, and implement a compulsory savings system for all workers. Erhard's new measures aroused opposition from many members of the Bonn parliament, who demanded his dismissal. Although the motion for dismissal was not ultimately passed, those who voted in favor included not only Communist parliamentarians, but also parliamentarians from the Social Democratic Party, the Center Party, and the Economic Reconstruction Party.

　　The Hanover bourgeois weekly "Der Spiegel" openly expressed strong dissatisfaction with the American policy of arming West Germany. The publication said: "Anyone who closely watches American policy in recent months can only come to the conclusion that the United States does not want a Four-Power Conference at all. Its policy of rejecting negotiations and heading towards war means that political leaders like Adenauer, who support American policy, should also be responsible for the consequences of this policy."

　　Even American imperialists cannot fail to perceive the extreme unpopularity of the American occupation authorities and the Bonn government. "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Cook, who is currently traveling in West Germany, wrote: "The people show little reaction and no respect for the Bonn government, and only complaints about the Allies. This is the measure of how we are faring in the Cold War in Germany, and it is not an encouraging situation. Here, the gap between the leaders and the people is very wide."

　　An Associated Press dispatch from Bonn on the 22nd also revealed that Western officials are "concerned that the distance between Germany and Western countries is widening... These officials say: The people of West Germany, in the center of Europe, under the control of the Allied occupation authorities, are becoming increasingly difficult to manage, and in this situation, quarrels and distrust between Allied officials and German leaders are increasing." The agency also admitted that Western surveys show that "most Germans extremely dislike this Bonn regime under Allied control."

### 阿登纳政府日益孤立

　　阿登纳政府日益孤立
    【新华社二十七日讯】美帝国主义利用阿登纳政府积极重新武装西德，从而使西德经济陷于绝境的政策，已使阿登纳政府受到西德人民越来越猛烈的反对，使它在政治上越来越陷于孤立。
    在最近波恩议会举行的会议上，波恩经济部长艾哈德要求每年再增加捐税七十至九十亿马克，为军事生产筹集资金。为此，他提出要限制消费，提高农产品价格，并对一切劳动者实行强迫储蓄制。艾哈德的这种新措施，激起了波恩议会许多议员的反对，他们要求把他免职。虽然罢免案最后并没有通过，但是投赞成票的，不仅有共产党的议员，而且还有社会民主党、中央党和经济建设党的议员。
    汉诺威资产阶级的《明镜》周刊公开对美国武装西德的政策表示强烈的不满。该刊说：“凡是密切注视最近几个月来的美国政策的人，只能下一个结论，就是：美国根本不要举行四国会议。它拒绝谈判的政策而走向战争，像阿登纳这种支持美国政策的政治领袖，也应该对于这种政策的后果负责。”
    甚至美国帝国主义分子也不能不觉察到美国占领当局与波恩政府之极端不得人心。现在正在西德旅行的“纽约先驱论坛报”记者寇克写道：“人民对于波恩政府，既少反应，也不尊敬，对于盟国，则只有埋怨而已。我们在冷战中在德国的处境如何，这就是衡量的尺度，这并不是一种令人振奋的情况。在这里，领导人物与人民之间的鸿沟是很宽的。”
    美联社波恩二十二日消息也透露，西方官员“担心德国和西方国家之间的距离正在加宽……。这些官员说：在欧洲中心的西德人民，在盟国占领当局的管制下，变得越来越难以驾驭了，在这种情况下，盟国官员和德国领袖间的争吵和互不信任日益增加。”该社并承认，西方国家的调查表明，“大多数德国人极端讨厌这个在盟国管制下的波恩政权。”
