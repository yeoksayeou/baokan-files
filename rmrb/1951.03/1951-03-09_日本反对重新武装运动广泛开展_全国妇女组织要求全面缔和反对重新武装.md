    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: Movements against rearmament and demanding comprehensive peace are developing widely throughout Japan.
    The Japan-Soviet Friendship Association held an expanded board meeting in Tokyo on February 8th and 9th. The meeting decided that the comprehensive peace movement will be the center of the association's activities going forward.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Japanese Buddhist Peace Forum, composed of prominent figures in the Japanese Buddhist community, issued a peace statement on January 11th, calling on Buddhists to do everything possible to prevent a new world war and ensure lasting world peace. Among those who have signed the statement are many prominent figures in the Japanese Buddhist community, including Professor Kamon Ebe of Japan University, President Ryudo Iinuma of Rissho University, and Master Dadao Shakushi of the Rinzai Sect. The committee will widely mobilize Buddhists to sign the statement.
    Kyoto University previously resolved to collect 40,000 signatures on a petition demanding comprehensive peace. As of February 4th, approximately 8,000 signatures had been collected in less than ten days.
    Aichi Prefecture held its second comprehensive peace symposium on February 10th, with the participation of representatives from labor unions, youth organizations, cultural organizations, as well as citizens, farmers, women, students, and merchants, totaling approximately one hundred and several dozen people. The meeting resolved to organize the "Aichi Prefecture Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council" to collect signatures in various locations demanding comprehensive peace and opposing rearmament, and to unite all people who demand peace and independence.
    In order to intensify preparations for war, the reactionary Yoshida government recently salvaged sunken military supplies in the sea near Naruto City on Shikoku Island, resulting in a major explosion on January 29th. More than 3,000 houses were damaged, property losses amounted to approximately 100 million yen, and more than 17,000 people were affected. Local residents unanimously demanded that the Yoshida government compensate for the losses and investigate responsibility. A residents' meeting in Kitahama Town of the city pointed out that the fundamental reason for this tragedy lies in the government's policy of war preparation. The meeting decided to establish a peace organization to fight against war, against separate peace, and to demand the immediate conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Dentsu Agency on the 7th, the National Council of Women's Organizations recently passed a resolution to designate March 8th, International Women's Day, as "the Day of Struggle for Comprehensive Peace and to Stop War." This action reflects the sentiment of women throughout Japan demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with the participation of the Soviet Union and New China, and opposing Japanese rearmament. One of the council's slogans is: "Let us send the occupying forces home through a comprehensive peace treaty." A recent survey of women workers in the Nagoya municipal government showed that 91 percent of them oppose rearmament.

　　日本反对重新武装运动广泛开展
    全国妇女组织要求全面缔和反对重新武装
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：反对重新武装与要求全面媾和的运动，正在日本各地广泛开展中。
    日苏亲善协会于二月八、九两日在东京举行扩大理事会。会议决定今后以全面媾和运动为该协会的活动中心。
    由日本佛教界有地位人士组成的日本佛教徒和平座谈会筹备会，曾于一月十一日发表和平声明书，号召佛教徒全力制止新的世界大战，确保世界永久和平。在该声明书上签名的已有日本大学教授江部鸭村、立正大学校长饭沼龙道、临济宗师家释大道等日本佛教界名流多人。该会将广泛发动佛教徒在这个声明上签名。
    京都大学前曾决议全力征集四万人在要求全面媾和书上签名。截至二月四日为止，在不到十天中，已征集到约八千人签名。
    爱知县曾于二月十日举行第二次全面媾和座谈会，参加者有工会、青年、文化组织的代表以及市民、农民、妇女、学生、商人等，共约一百数十人。会上决议在爱知县组织“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”，在各地征集要求全面媾和、反对重新武装的签名，团结所有要求和平与独立的人民。
    吉田反动政府为加紧备战，最近曾在四国岛鸣门市附近海岸打捞沉没海中的军火，结果于一月二十九日发生大爆炸事件，受灾房屋达三千户以上，财产损失约达一亿日元，受害者达一万七千余人。当地居民一致要求吉田政府赔偿损失，并追究责任。该市北滨町居民大会并指出：这次惨案的基本原因在于政府的备战政策。大会决定成立和平组织，为反对战争、反对单独媾和与要求立即缔结全面和约而斗争。
    【新华社八日讯】据电通社东京七日讯：妇女组织全国理事会最近通过决议，把三月八日国际妇女节作为“争取全面和约及制止战争斗争日”。这个行动反映了日本全国妇女要求缔结有苏联和新中国参加的全面和约以及反对日本重新武装的情绪。理事会的一个口号是：“让我们通过全面和约把占领军送回家去”。最近调查名古屋市政府妇女工作者的结果，表明她们中间有百分之九十一是反对重新武装的。
