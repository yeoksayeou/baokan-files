	A Great Victory for the Cause of Peace

	The First Session of the World Peace Council, which opened in Berlin on February 21st, closed victoriously on February 26th. The conference issued a declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers to consolidate world peace and international security. The conference also unanimously adopted nine important documents, including the "Resolution on the United Nations," "Resolution on the Unjust Decision of the United Nations to Condemn the People's Republic of China as an 'Aggressor' in Korea," "Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question," "Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the German Question," "Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the Japanese Question," and "Resolution on the Struggle of Colonies and Dependent Countries for Peace." These historically significant declarations and decisions are the program for the current worldwide struggle of the people against aggression and in defense of peace.

	The World Peace Council issued a declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact because the Soviet Union, China, Britain, the United States, and France occupy the most important position in the world. If they agree to guarantee world peace, a world war can be completely avoided. The Soviet Union has twice proposed in the United Nations the conclusion of a peace pact, and this proposal has received the sincere support of the People's Republic of China and the broad masses of people around the world. However, the American, British, and French aggressive blocs have tried their best to obstruct the conclusion of this pact. They openly stand against the people of the world, concluding regional aggressive pacts to replace comprehensive peace pacts, creating disputes and divisions to replace agreements and consensus, with the aim of using violence and lies to coerce and deceive the people, so as to drag the masses of people into another world war. The World Peace Council issued a declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, calling on the people of all countries to sign this declaration, and warning that "any government that refuses to hold a meeting to conclude such a pact proves that the government has aggressive intentions." This will mobilize the people of all countries to pressure the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to accept the demand for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. If the governments of these three countries stubbornly refuse this demand, then their aggressive intentions will be completely exposed, and the masses of people around the world will become more aware, thereby greatly promoting the development of the world peace movement.

	In the resolutions on the United Nations and the Korean issue, etc., the World Peace Council clearly pointed out: "The United Nations has further disappointed the people's expectations, and the people's disappointment has reached its peak due to the adoption of the resolution condemning China as an 'aggressor.'" The World Peace Council demands the cancellation of this unfair and illegal resolution and calls for the convening of a conference of relevant countries, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and the determination of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves. These resolutions of the World Peace Council are very normal, and only in this way can the Korean issue be resolved peacefully. The World Peace Council has decided to send a delegation to the United Nations to ask it to express its views on the various resolutions of the World Peace Council and to require it to fulfill the tasks stipulated in the United Nations Charter. This measure will subject the United Nations to the most rigorous test in front of the people of the world. If it finally ignores the peaceful aspirations of the majority of mankind, it will indicate that it has completely betrayed its mission of guaranteeing peace, and this will subject it to the contempt of all mankind.

	In the resolutions on the peaceful settlement of the German and Japanese issues, the World Peace Council demanded that the opinions of the entire German people be heard on the German issue and that a peace treaty be concluded with a peace-loving and unified Germany in 1951; the withdrawal of occupying forces from Japan, and comprehensive negotiations on a peace treaty with Japan by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. The World Peace Council called on the people of the European countries that signed the North Atlantic Treaty to convene a conference in Europe, and invited representatives of the German people to participate; to convene a regional conference in Asia including the people of Japan and other relevant countries to defend peace. The resolutions of the World Peace Council on the German and Japanese issues will enable the people of Europe and the people of Asia to further unite and use their own strength to promote the realization of the resolutions of the World Peace Council.

	The first session of the World Peace Council shows that the Council is developing into a strong and authoritative international organization in accordance with the wishes of peace-loving people around the world, and is becoming the leading body of the great movement of the people of all countries to strive for peace. With this organization, the peace forces of all countries are organized into a surging torrent, heading towards the great goal: opposing aggressive wars and defending world peace.

	The first session of the World Peace Council also shows that the ranks of the world peace movement are expanding day by day, and the world peace united front is increasingly broadly including more social forces. Many people who did not participate in the Second World Peace Congress also attended this Council meeting. In addition to the original 222 council members, 38 new members have been added. The people of Thailand, the Philippines and other countries also sent representatives to participate in the Council for the first time. At the same time, the World Peace Council has also taken active measures to unite more social forces to participate in the world peace movement. It can be predicted that with the implementation of the resolutions of this session of the World Peace Council, the world peace movement will inevitably develop on a broader and grander scale.

  The Soviet Elections and the Fourth Price Reduction

	On February 18th and 25th, the sixteen Soviet Union Republics held elections to their respective Supreme Soviets. The results were complete victory for candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party bloc. On March 1st, the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party issued a decision on the fourth price reduction since 1947, reducing state retail prices for food and manufactured goods from 10 to 22 percent. These two major events in the Soviet Union recently prove the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, and the further development and prosperity of the Soviet Union in the economy.

	This year's election movement in the Soviet Union was carried out on the basis of the victorious completion of the post-war five-year plan. The Soviet people expressed unparalleled love and loyalty to the Soviet Communist Party and the great leader Stalin, who led them from victory to victory. The nomination movement of candidates began in January, and the people of all ethnic groups unanimously nominated Stalin as the first candidate, and actively participated in the labor competition to welcome the election. The election results showed that more than 90 percent of voters in all regions voted for the candidates of the Party and the non-Party bloc. In the Russian Federation, Stalin won 100 percent of the votes and was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet. The day of the vote coincided with Stalin's important speech on the current international situation. The voters in all regions unanimously voted to elect the candidates of the Party and the non-Party bloc, which was a vote to support the Soviet Union's peace policy and the cause of world peace, and a vote to support the further prosperity of the Soviet Union and the happiness of the people.

	The Soviet Union has reduced prices four times in a row since 1947. The first three price reductions have benefited the people by at least 267 billion rubles. This year's price reduction will further benefit the people by 27.5 billion rubles in one year, and another 7 billion rubles will benefit the people due to the price reduction affecting the collective farm market. The Soviet Union's ability to continuously reduce prices is a direct result of the tremendous development of socialist industrial and agricultural production, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs. At the same time, price reduction is an important method of expanding industrial production in the socialist economic system. Stalin pointed out in his report at the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party in 1927: "Because nationalized industry is the largest and most powerful industry, it can implement a policy of continuously reducing cost fees, reducing wholesale prices, and reducing commodity prices, thus expanding the market for its products, increasing the capacity of the domestic market, and creating a source of continuous expansion of production for itself." Stalin also said: "Lowering the prices of industrial products is the most important lever for improving our industry, expanding the market, and strengthening industrial development." Therefore, the Soviet Union's price reduction not only represents the improvement of people's lives, but also represents the larger-scale development of the Soviet Union's communist construction. At a time when the people of the capitalist world are increasingly falling into hunger and death due to the aggressive forces' stepped-up arms race, the superiority of the socialist system shown by the brilliant achievements of Soviet construction is the greatest encouragement to mankind in its struggle against imperialism and its final transition to socialism.

  The Struggle of the People of Western Europe Against Aggressive War

	At present, the movement of the people of Western European countries against new wars is continuing to rise.

	In Britain, the movement of people from all walks of life against the Attlee government's war policy is developing rapidly. Their central slogans are "No War with China" and "Oppose the Arming of West Germany." On March 3rd, nearly 4,000 representatives from Labor Party branches and trade union branches held a meeting in London, resolving to oppose the arming of West Germany, demanding that all troops withdraw from Korea, and returning Taiwan to China. The speeches at the meeting expressed strong anti-American sentiment. Currently, more than 100 local Labor Party branches across the country have requested the Labor Party Executive Committee to convene an emergency meeting to discuss international issues and revise its foreign policy. Cole, a well-known Labor Party political commentator and former chairman of the Fabian Society, recently published his views in the magazine "New Statesman and Nation," saying: "If Britain is dragged into a war against China by the Americans, I will stand on China's side. If Britain agrees to rearm West Germany, I will feel unable to encourage British workers... to produce arms for a European war that has nothing to do with freedom and democracy." Cole received several hundred letters supporting his views within just a few days after publishing his article. All of this, as British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt pointed out: "The British people have taken action, and now is a beginning."

	In France, the French people regard opposition to the arming of West Germany as the central struggle for peace. Under the strong leadership of the French Communist Party, 3.5 million people across the country have signed petitions protesting the arming of West Germany. This movement has developed into a national mass movement.

	In Italy, due to the people's strong opposition to the Gasperi government, a serious split has occurred within Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party. A large number of members of the party recently voted in the lower house along with the Communist Party and the Socialist Party against the government's bill to militarize the Italian economy. The majority of votes obtained by the Gasperi government was therefore reduced from 130 to 16 votes. The Italian reactionary ruling group, which originally held an absolute majority in parliament, has therefore fallen into unprecedented isolation. The call of the Italian people for the Gasperi government to resign has spread throughout the country.

	In other Western European countries, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, held the largest demonstration of 75,000 people since the war on February 25th, protesting the rearming of German executioners. In Copenhagen, Denmark, 15,000 people demonstrated in front of the parliament on February 6th, shouting: "No alliance with Hitler's generals!"

	All these facts that have occurred in Western European countries show that the entire Western Europe is facing a climax of a great peace movement. The further development of this movement will inevitably shatter the evil plans of the war profiteers.

    和平事业的伟大胜利
    二月二十一日在柏林揭幕的世界和平理事会第一届会议，已于二月二十六日胜利闭幕了。会议发表宣言，要求缔结五大国和平公约，以巩固世界和平与国际安全。会议并一致通过了“关于联合国的决议”，“关于联合国通过谴责中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的‘侵略者’的不公正的决定之决议”，“关于和平解决朝鲜问题的决议”，“关于以和平方式解决德国问题的决议”，“关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议”，以及“关于殖民地与附属国争取和平的斗争的决议”等九项重要文件。这些具有历史意义的重要宣言和决定，是目前全世界人民为反对侵略、保卫和平而进行斗争的纲领。
    世界和平理事会发表要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，是因为苏、中、英、美、法五大国在全世界占有最重要的地位，如果它们协议保障世界和平，世界大战是完全可以避免的。苏联曾经两度在联合国提出缔结和平公约的建议，这一建议获得了中华人民共和国以及全世界广大人民的衷心支持。但是，美、英、法侵略集团却竭力阻挠缔结这一公约，它们公然与全世界人民为敌，缔结了区域性的侵略公约以代替全面的和平公约；制造纠纷与分裂，以代替协议与一致，其目的是企图用暴力和谎言来胁迫和欺骗人民，以便将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中。世界和平理事会发表要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，号召各国人民在这宣言上签字，并警告说：“任何一国政府拒绝举行会议缔结这种公约，就证明该国政府有侵略的图谋”。这将使各国人民动员起来，压迫美、英、法三国政府接受缔结五国和平公约的要求，如果这三国政府悍然拒绝这一要求，那末它们的侵略图谋就完全被揭破，全世界人民群众就更加觉悟起来，从而大大促进世界和平运动的发展。
    世界和平理事会议在关于联合国和朝鲜问题等决议中，明白指出：“联合国已更进一步地辜负了人民对它的期望，并且由于通过谴责中国为‘侵略者’的决议而使人民的失望达于顶点。”世界和平理事会要求取消这个不公平和非法的决议，并要求召开有关国家的会议、从朝鲜撤退外国军队和朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自行决定。世界和平理事会的这些决议是十分正常的，也只有这样，朝鲜问题才能和平解决。世界和平理事会已决定派遣代表团赴联合国，要求它对世界和平理事会的各项决议表示意见，并要求它履行联合国宪章所规定的任务。这一措施将使联合国在全世界人民面前受到最严格的考验。如果它终于忽视占人类大多数的人民的和平愿望，那就表示它已彻底背叛了它所负担的保障和平的使命，这将使它遭受全人类的唾弃。
    世界和平理事会议在以和平方式解决德国和日本问题的决议中，要求在德国问题上听取德国人民的全民公意，并争取在一九五一年内与爱好和平的统一的德国缔结和约；在日本撤退占领军，并由中、苏、美、英四国谈判全面对日和约。世界和平理事会号召在欧洲召开北大西洋公约欧洲各签约国的人民的会议，并邀请德国人民代表参加；在亚洲召开包括日本人民在内的有关国家的保卫和平的区域会议。世界和平理事会关于德国和日本问题的决议，将使欧洲人民和亚洲人民进一步团结起来，用自己的力量来促使世界和平理事会的决议得以实现。
    世界和平理事会的第一届会议表明：理事会正按照全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，日益发展成为强有力的权威的国际组织，成为各国人民为争取和平而进行的巨大运动的领导机构。有了这个机构，各国和平力量就组织成澎湃的洪流，奔向伟大的目标：反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议又表明：世界和平运动的队伍正日益扩大，世界和平统一战线正日益广泛地包括更多的社会力量。这次理事会会议中，有许多没有参加第二届世界和平大会的人也出席了，理事会理事除了原来的二百二十二人外又增添了三十八人，泰国、菲律宾等国人民也第一次派代表参加了理事会。同时世界和平理事会还采取了积极的措施，团结更多的社会力量参加世界和平运动。可以预料，随着世界和平理事会本届会议决议的执行，世界和平运动必将以更广阔与宏大的规模发展起来。
  苏联的选举和第四次减低物价
    二月十八日和二十五日，苏联十六个加盟共和国分别举行了最高苏维埃选举，选举结果苏联共产党与非党联盟的候选人获得完全的胜利。三月一日，苏联部长会议和联共中央发布了一九四七年来第四次减低物价的决定，减低食品及制成品的国家零售价格从百分之十到百分之二十二。最近苏联的这两大事件，证明了苏联人民在精神和政治上的牢不可破的团结，和苏联在经济上的进一步发展繁荣。
    今年苏联的选举运动，是在战后五年计划胜利完成的基础上进行的。苏联人民对于领导他们从胜利走向胜利的苏联共产党和伟大领袖斯大林，表示了无比的爱戴与忠诚。候选人的提名运动在一月间便开始，各族人民万众一心地提出斯大林为第一个候选人，并且纷纷参加了迎接选举的劳动竞赛。选举结果显示各地百分之九十以上的选民都投了党与非党联盟候选人的票，在俄罗斯联邦，斯大林已获得百分之百的选票当选为最高苏维埃代表。投票之日恰在斯大林就目前国际形势发表了重要的谈话之后，各地选民一致投票选举党与非党联盟候选人，便是投票拥护苏联的和平政策和世界和平事业，便是投票拥护苏联的进一步繁荣与人民的幸福。
    苏联从一九四七年以来，已连续四次减低物价。前三次减价至少使人民获益二千六百七十亿卢布，今年的减价将再使人民在一年内获益二百七十五亿卢布，另外因影响集体农场市场的减价还要使人民获益七十亿卢布。苏联能够接连地减低物价，是社会主义工、农业生产的巨大发展、劳动生产率提高和生产成本降低的直接结果。同时减低物价又是社会主义经济制度中扩大工业生产的重要方法。斯大林在一九二七年联共十五次代表大会上的报告中曾经指出：“因为国有化的工业是最大的最强有力的工业，它可以实施不断的减低成本费、减低批发价格、减低商品价格的政策，因此也就扩大了销售它的生产品的市场，增加了国内市场的容量，替自己造成了不断扩大生产的源泉。”斯大林又说：“降低工业品的价格是改善我们工业、扩大市场及加强工业发展的源泉之最主要的杠杆。”因此，苏联减低物价不仅表示了人民生活的提高，并且表示着苏联的共产主义建设将有更大规模的发展。在资本主义世界的人民正因侵略势力的加紧备战而日益陷于饥饿与死亡之时，苏联建设的辉煌成就所显示的社会主义制度的优越性，乃是对人类进行反对帝国主义斗争并最后走向社会主义的最大鼓舞。
  西欧人民的反对侵略战争的斗争
    目前，西欧各国人民的反对新战争的运动，正在继续高涨。
    在英国，各阶层人民反对艾德礼政府战争政策的运动，正在飞速开展。他们的中心口号是“不与中国作战”和“反对武装西德”。三月三日在伦敦有近四千名工党支部与工会分会的代表举行会议，决议反对武装西德，要求一切军队撤出朝鲜，把台湾归还中国。会上的发言表现了强烈的反美情绪。目前在全国各地已有一百多个工党地方支部，要求工党执行委员会召开讨论国际问题的紧急会议，重订外交政策。工党著名政论家，前费边社主席柯尔最近在《新政治家与民族》杂志上发表政见说：“如果英国被美国人拖入对中国的战争中，我将站在中国的一边。如果英国同意重新武装西德，我将感到无法再鼓励英国工人们……为一个与自由和民主毫不相干的欧洲战争去生产军火。”柯尔在发表其文章之后仅几天之内便收到好几百封信件支持他的意见。所有这一切，正如英国共产党总书记波立特所指出：“英国人民已经行动起来了，现在正是一个开始。”
    在法国，法国人民把反对武装西德，作为争取和平的中心斗争。在法国共产党强有力的领导下，全国迄今已有三百五十万人签名抗议武装西德。这个运动已发展成为全国性的群众运动。
    在意大利，由于人民对加斯贝利政府的强烈反对，已使加斯贝利的基督教民主党内部发生了严重分裂。该党有很大部分议员，最近在下院中和共产党、社会党一道，投票反对政府使意大利经济军事化的法案。加斯贝利政府获得的多数票因此而由一百三十票减少到十六票。在议会中本来拥有绝对多数的意大利反动统治集团，因此已陷于空前的孤立。意大利人民要求加斯贝利政府辞职的呼声，已弥漫全国。
    在西欧其他国家，荷兰阿姆斯特丹于二月二十五日举行了七万五千人的战后最大的示威游行，抗议重新武装德国刽子手。丹麦哥本哈根有一万五千人二月六日在议会门前示威，高呼：“不要和希特勒将领联盟！”
    在西欧各国发生的这一切事实说明：整个西欧正面临着一个伟大的和平运动的高潮。这个运动的进一步发展，必将最后粉碎战争贩子的罪恶计划。
