Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily
    Heilongjiang Province Keshan County Coal Construction Company
    Extremely Chaotic Revenue and Expenditure Situation; Willing to Accept Criticism

Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 24th published an article titled "Keshan Coal Construction Company Coal Factory, Revenue and Expenditure Situation Extremely Chaotic." In addition to humbly accepting the criticism, we are submitting the following self-criticism report.

    (1) On January 11th, the Keshan Office of the Northeast Bank came to our company to buy one ton of Jixi coal (the purpose was to test whether the coal hopper measured enough coal). When the hopper was about to be filled, the comrade from the bank who came to buy the coal asked, "Is it enough?" Because there were many villagers buying coal that day, and only one comrade was in charge of dispensing coal, the person dispensing the coal did not look closely when that comrade asked the question and simply said "enough," which resulted in an insufficient amount of coal.

    (2) The Keshan Distillery bought 200 tons of Hegang coal from our factory, and there was indeed an insufficient quantity. This was because we had not sold Hegang coal before and did not understand that Hegang coal, with the same volume as other coals, has a different weight. We continued to use the old coal hopper to measure and sell coal, which caused the shortage. In addition to providing the Keshan Distillery with eleven tons of coal to make up the difference, we have also replaced the old coal hopper with a new one that is measured according to the volume of Hegang coal for selling coal.

    (3) The remaining 1,489 tons of coal in January is the total amount of coal remaining since 1947.

    (4) The villagers load the coal onto their vehicles themselves. Whenever the delivery clerk measures enough coal, some people will add a few more shovels, so the coal the villagers buy is enough.

    (5) When measuring coal, if large pieces of coal are loaded, the gaps in the coal hopper will be larger, which may result in an insufficient quantity. If only fine coal is loaded, it may exceed the quantity.

    In addition to the above situations that caused the insufficient quantity, some coal buyers do not come to the coal factory to check the weight and load the trucks themselves. Instead, they hire horse-drawn carts to directly haul coal from the coal factory. Generally speaking, the carters are willing to load less coal, because this makes it easier for the horses to pull and the people can save more effort.

    In order to maintain the credibility of state-owned commerce and the interests of the people, we will establish a high sense of responsibility to both buyers and sellers in the future. We also hope that various organizations will regularly provide us with opinions.

### 对人民日报批评建议的反应  黑龙江省克山县煤建公司  收支情况极度混乱愿接受批评

　　对人民日报批评建议的反应
    黑龙江省克山县煤建公司
    收支情况极度混乱愿接受批评编辑同志：
    二月二十四日人民日报“读者来信”刊载“克山煤建公司煤厂，收支情况极度混乱”一稿，我们除虚心接受批评外，并作下面检讨报告。
    （一）一月十一日东北银行克山办事处到我公司买鸡西煤一吨（目的是试验煤斗量煤是否够数），将要装满斗子的时候，银行来买煤的同志即问：“够不够？”因为当天买煤的老乡很多，而只有一个同志照顾付煤，所以在那位同志问话的时候，付煤的人未曾细看，就说“够了”，因之发生不够煤数的事情。
    （二）克山制酒厂在本厂买鹤岗煤二○○吨，确有不足数量的事情。这是由于我们过去没有卖过鹤岗煤，不懂得鹤岗煤同其他煤在同等体积时，其重量是不相同的。而我们仍用旧煤斗量煤售煤，所以造成了不足数的情况，除已给克山制酒厂补煤十一吨外，并已按鹤岗煤的体量换用新煤斗售煤。
    （三）一月份余煤一四八九吨，是我们从一九四七年以来余煤的总数。
    （四）老乡们买煤都是由他们自己动手装车，每当付货员量够数的时候，有的人还要多装几锨煤，所以老乡们买的煤都是够数的。
    （五）量煤时，如果装大块煤，煤斗子里的空隙就大些，因此就会产生不足数量的情况。如果尽装细末，就可能超过数量。
    除上述造成不足数量的一些情况外，有些买煤户自己不来煤厂看秤装车，却雇一些马车直接到煤厂拖煤，一般说，车夫是愿意少装煤，因为这样可以使马拉得轻快一些，人也可以比较省力。
    为了维护国营商业的信誉和人民的利益，今后我们将对买卖双方建立高度负责的精神。并希望各机关能对我们经常提供意见。
