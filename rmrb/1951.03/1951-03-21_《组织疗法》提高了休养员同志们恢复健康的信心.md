　　"Tissue Therapy" Enhances Confidence in Recovery for Comrades Undergoing Recuperation

    Comrade Shi Duo of the Jiaxing Cadre Sanatorium of the Zhejiang Military Region writes:

    The medical articles published in the People's Daily this month, especially "Tissue Therapy," are very welcome to the physicians of our sanatorium. Our recuperating comrades have also gained confidence in their recovery as a result, which is particularly helpful to the hospital's work. The doctors hope to see continuous publication of experiences related to the application of "Tissue Therapy," as its application in our country is still a new beginning, and we are unfamiliar with the techniques. In addition, we hope that your newspaper can introduce more new Soviet medicine in the future. I believe this will also be a powerful education for the medical community's blind worship of the United States and Britain.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Shi Duo's suggestion is very good. We plan to continuously publish some articles on the application experience of "Tissue Therapy" and the introduction of new Soviet medicine in the future.

### 《组织疗法》提高了休养员同志们恢复健康的信心

　　《组织疗法》提高了休养员同志们恢复健康的信心
     浙江军区嘉兴干部疗养院史铎同志来信说：
    人民日报在本月所刊载的医学文章，尤其是《组织疗法》，本院医师都十分欢迎，我们休养员同志也因此提高了恢复健康的信心，特别是对医院业务上帮助很大。医生们希望连续刊出关于《组织疗法》应用的经验，因为在我国应用《组织疗法》还是一个新的开始，在技术上是生疏的。此外还希望你报今后能多多介绍苏联新医学，我以为这对于医药界盲目崇拜美英的心理也是一个有力的教育。
    编者按：史铎同志的建议是很好的。我们今后准备连续刊登一些有关《组织疗法》应用经验和介绍苏联新医学的文章。
