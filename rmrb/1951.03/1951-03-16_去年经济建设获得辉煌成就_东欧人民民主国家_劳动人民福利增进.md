Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The brilliant achievements of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania and other People's Democratic countries in economic construction in 1950 have further increased the happiness of the laboring people.

The wages of workers in various People's Democratic countries in 1950 have greatly increased compared to 1949. Real wages in Poland increased by 6 percent; Czechoslovakia increased by 26 percent; Romania increased by 11 percent; Hungary increased by 19 percent; and Bulgaria increased by 9.2 percent.

The improvement in the living standards of the laboring people is also reflected in the increase in the production and sales of consumer goods and food. Poland's retail trade volume in 1950 increased by 14.5 percent based on comparable prices. In Czechoslovakia, sales of meat and flour increased by 28 to 84 percent, while textiles and daily necessities increased by 21 to 231 percent. The trade volume of state-owned and cooperative enterprises in Romania increased by more than 30 percent. Meat and fat consumption in Hungary increased by 20 to 30 percent. The output of various consumer goods and food in Bulgaria increased by 11 to 46 percent, and shoes and socks increased by 127 percent. Sales of wool fabrics in Albania increased by 49 percent, meat increased by 49 percent, and flour products increased by 82 percent.

The people of various People's Democratic countries widely enjoy the benefits of vacation and medical care. A total of 546,000 laboring people in Poland took vacations last year. As of July last year, there were 1,222 health stations nationwide, compared to only 482 before the war. Czechoslovakia had 500,000 people on vacation last year, and the number of national health resorts increased by 24 percent compared to 1949. In the third quarter of last year, 157,000 people in Romania vacationed in sanatoriums. At the same time, 58 new mobile medical teams, 39 maternity hospitals, and 32 pharmacies were established. The number of laboring people undergoing treatment in sanatoriums in Hungary increased by 40 percent compared to 1949, and the benefits laboring people received from medical care and social insurance were equivalent to 40 percent of their wages. Before liberation, Bulgaria had only a few well-equipped hospitals, but by last year there were 130 hospitals and many special clinics and children's hospitals. Albania spent 70 million lek on subsidies for laboring people temporarily unable to work last year. The 15 newly established sanatoriums can accommodate 10,000 people.

    【新华社十五日讯】波、捷、罗、匈、保和阿尔巴尼亚等人民民主国家一九五○年在经济建设上的辉煌成就，已进一步增进了劳动人民的幸福。
