Editor's Note: Farmers across the country are enthusiastically responding to the challenge from the national agricultural labor model Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team to increase production. This will be a powerful guarantee for completing this year's agricultural production plan. Relevant departments at all levels should strengthen their leadership of this movement, continue to deeply mobilize farmers' mutual aid teams to discuss the challenge conditions of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, encourage farmers everywhere to accept the challenge, and push the patriotic competition movement in rural areas to a climax.

When mobilizing the masses to discuss challenge conditions, we should give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the farmers. Based on the conditions that are possible and on the basis of the farmers' voluntary participation, we should formulate realistic plans to increase production, preventing a tendency to aim too high and detach from reality. After accepting the challenge, regular inspections should be carried out to help solve specific problems in seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, farm tools, and technology. Combine this with patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, boosting the farmers' enthusiasm for production, and ensuring the realization of the production increase plan.

Challenging the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team

Editor, please forward to the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team:

We saw in the newspaper your mutual aid team's challenge to increase production, and everyone is very enthusiastic. Our village's fourteen ploughing groups have decided to accept your challenge. We plan to produce 77 jin of grain per mu this year, exceeding the pre-war level by 22 jin. To guarantee the completion of this plan, we will re-cultivate all the land this spring, and hoe it four times in the summer. We will purchase three new-style walking plows and one chaff cutter. To overcome pests, we have decided to collect all the stubble from the fields and dig up insect pupae (we have already dug up more than 20,000). This spring, we are implementing seed soaking and seed mixing before sowing; we are applying 56 dan of fertilizer per mu, an increase of 36 dan over last year. This year, we will not only guarantee increased agricultural production, but also increase sideline production. We plan to plant 30 mu of forest, increase the number of chickens by 800, sheep by 100, pigs by 120, and livestock by 20.

We have decided to strengthen the wolf-hunting team led by labor model Yu Chang, and strive to eliminate the wolf threat so that everyone can focus on production. We know that to complete these plans, everyone must redouble their efforts. We have decided to strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid team and carry out labor competitions between individuals and between groups. We have decided to mobilize 80 percent of young and middle-aged women to go to the fields to hoe seedlings and pull weeds, so that the whole village has no idle people and no lazy men.

We will also carry out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda while producing; assist the government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries; and strengthen patriotic and internationalist education to improve everyone's political and cultural level.

Comrade Li Shunda, we will do what we say and never make empty promises. See you at harvest time!

　　298 Mutual Aid Teams in Licheng County, Shanxi, Enthusiastically Accept the Challenge

A Judging Committee has been organized to check the progress of the competition and summarize experiences at any time.

Editor:

Two hundred and ninety-eight advanced agricultural production mutual aid teams in Licheng, Shanxi, including the famous provincial labor models Shi Cunjin and Dong Taoqi, have accepted the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in Pingshun, guaranteeing a bumper harvest of crops this year. The main contents of their challenge plan are: the average yield per mu (millet) is required to reach 318.5 jin, an increase of 20 jin over last year, exceeding the average yield per mu before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 87 percent. To achieve this goal, they put forward the following guarantees in their challenge letter: (1) In cultivation, they require three ploughings, three harrowings, four weedings, and three hoeings. Some groups will do four ploughings and four hoeings. Double-legged drills (new farm tools) will be used on 60 percent of the land, and single-handle plows and liberation-style weeding hoes and other new farm tools will be widely used. Each group will add one to two new farm tools. (2) Complete the soil improvement work on 3,500 mu of cultivated land. (3) Apply an average of 110 dan of fertilizer per mu, an increase of 20 dan over last year. Ensure that 60 percent of autumn fields and 25 percent of wheat fields are top-dressed, and improve the quality of fertilizer and apply fertilizer according to the soil. (4) Achieve 80 percent hot water soaking and chemical seed dressing, and ensure that all seeds are replaced with improved varieties. (5) Rectify the mutual aid teams and combine the mutual aid teams with improved technology. Currently, each group has one person who has received technical training at the county technical training class. Fifty-seven mutual aid teams, including Shi Cunjin and Dong Taoqi, have extracted 5 percent of their land's harvest as public accumulation funds for buying new farm tools and resolving difficulties within the group. (6) Mobilize 80 percent of women to participate in agricultural production regularly.

In order to realize the above plan, 298 mutual aid teams fully agreed to the first four guarantees proposed by Li Shunda (Note: see the top news on page 1 of this newspaper on March 9), and hired 15 judges to continuously inspect each group, make a summary after the autumn harvest, and publish it in the newspaper. The judges are: the Secretary of the Licheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Deputy County Head, the Head of the Agriculture Section, the Secretary of the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the County Head, the Head of the Agriculture Section, the Secretary of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Commissioner of the Commissioner's Office, the Head of the Agriculture Section of the Commissioner's Office, and six labor models from Pingshun and Licheng, including Shi Cunjin and Li Shunda.

The Mutual Aid Team Challenges Li Shunda

Editor:

Our mutual aid team has formulated a full-year production plan to challenge the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in Shanxi Province. Our production plan is: this year, the whole team will sow 8.9 mu of cotton (not planted last year), with a net yield of 35 jin of cotton per mu; plant 10.9 mu of peanuts, with a net yield of 220 jin of peanut kernels per mu; 3 mu of jute (never planted before), with a yield of 200 jin per mu; plant 17 mu of sweet potatoes, with a yield of 2,100 jin per mu; 17.4 mu of wheat, with a yield of 165 jin per mu; 10 mu of corn, with a yield of 310 jin per mu; 11.5 mu of beans, intercropped with corn, with a yield of 200 jin per mu; in addition to other miscellaneous grains, the total annual output of the whole team is required to be 31,500 jin (cotton, jute, peanuts, and sweet potatoes are all converted into grain for calculation), with an average yield of 450 jin per mu, an increase of 40 jin over last year.

Our guarantees for increasing production: (1) Cultivate meticulously and improve the soil. (2) There are five existing wells and two waterwheels. This spring, we will dig two more wells to guarantee irrigation of 14 mu of land. (3) This year, we will apply an average of 20 carts of fertilizer per mu (18 carts last year), plus 1,000 jin of bean cake and 250 jin of chemical fertilizer, and use rhizobium bacteria to plant peanuts. (4) Widely select improved varieties and select seeds in the field. (5) Use Shanxi Limin plows, new-style rice threshers, sprayers, powder sprayers, sweet potato hoes, liberation-style waterwheels, and other new farm tools. Each household will create an agricultural demonstration small farm to test fertilizers, seeds, and cultivation methods, and create and promote experience. (6) In addition to using scientific agents to kill pests and protect seedlings, we will also pick up insects while cultivating and ploughing the land, use arsenic stone to plant wheat, and isolate seed soaking, seed mixing, and fertilizer application.

In terms of consolidating the mutual aid team: we guarantee to implement equivalent exchange, improve the democratic meeting system, and conduct regular inspections, summaries, and clearing of work accounts.

　　Letter from the CPC Huguan County Committee, Shanxi

Introducing the Spring Ploughing Inspection Method in Qiaotou Village

Editor's Note: In order to strengthen the preparations for spring ploughing, Qiaotou Village in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, conducted a house-to-house inspection, which advanced the production of the masses and changed the cadres' paralysis and complacency. This method of in-depth inspection of production and specific help to the masses to solve problems is worth learning from all over the country. At present, various localities have issued instructions and formulated plans for this year's agricultural production increase work, and some have also launched challenges and responses, and have also made a lot of practical preparations. But if we think that this is enough, and no longer continue to inspect and lead and help farmers solve various specific problems, the completion of the production increase task will not have a solid guarantee.

Editor:

In order to ensure the completion of this year's production increase task, Qiaotou Village in the seventh district of Huguan County, Shanxi Province, conducted a spring ploughing preparation work inspection from house to house on the 22nd day of the old lunar calendar (hereinafter the same). The inspection results revealed three problems: (1) Uneven fertilizer storage. The village's 161 farmers have 1,670 mu of autumn land and have accumulated 117,129 dan of various fertilizers. Judging from the average figures, each mu has reached 70 dan, and the quantity is quite large. However, from the specific situation of each household, some are still severely lacking. Thirty households have accumulated 30 dan of fertilizer per mu, and 13 households have accumulated less than 20 dan per mu; (2) Insufficient fuel for farmers. Of the more than 160 households in the village, 65 households have fuel stored that can only last until the end of March at most. Many other households do not have fuel to burn right now; (3) Insufficient farm tools. It is estimated that the village will lack 10 hoes, 14 large shovels, 5 iron rakes, 2 weeders, 11 sieves and 54 other farm tools.

After such an in-depth inspection, the cadres of Qiaotou Village and the Communist Party members who played an active role in production were shocked and dispelled their blind complacency. They said: "We can't be paralyzed and complacent anymore, and we can't just look at the problem from general figures. If these specific problems of specific households are not solved, it will be difficult to complete the production increase plan." After discussion between cadres and the masses, the village re-formulated a spring ploughing production plan for 45 days before sowing. The plan stipulates that before February 5, a large amount of cinders will be compressed to make fertilizer, and 10,000 dan of wasteland fertilizer will be smoked to help households with insufficient fertilizer, and 4,000 jin of sesame cakes will be purchased. The whole village must prepare fuel before the end of April. Calculated according to this standard, the whole village lacks 450 carts of coal. All 54 carts in the village will be dispatched together, and can be transported from February 5 to 14. The lack of farm tools will be the responsibility of the village supply and marketing cooperative to organize blacksmiths and carpenters to repair or purchase them uniformly from outside, to ensure that they are not delayed for spring ploughing. The new plan also set out the procedure for spring ploughing work: from February 15 to March 10, the soil clods will be broken, the stubble will be harrowed, and the hard land accumulated with snow water will be ploughed once without ploughing the surface first. During this period, women should prepare shoes and socks, rice and flour for spring ploughing, and help to dry the seeds. Labor models and technical experts will carry out germination tests and replace improved varieties.

This plan has been reviewed and revised by the Village People's Congress and has been discussed at a village-wide farmers' meeting. The farmers all said: This spring ploughing plan is really practical. If we can do this in the future, we will be sure to increase production. Now the whole village is carrying out spring ploughing according to this plan.

　　中共山西壶关县委来信
    介绍桥头村检查春耕方法
    编者按：山西省壶关县桥头村为着加强春耕准备工作，曾经进行一次挨户检查，把群众的生产向前推进了一步，并改变了干部的麻痹大意与自满情绪。这种深入检查生产，具体帮助群众解决问题的方法，值得各地学习。目前各地对今年的农业增产工作已发了指示，订了计划，有的还发起了挑战应战，并且也作了很多实际准备工作。但如果认为这样已经够了，不再继续进行检查并领导和帮助农民解决各种具体问题，增产任务的完成就没有切实的保证。
                                      编辑同志：
    山西壶关七区桥头村为保证今年增产任务的完成，在旧历（以下均同）正月二十二日挨门逐户作了一次春耕准备工作的检查。检查结果，发现三个问题：（一）积存肥料不平均。全村一百六十一户农民共有秋地一千六百七十亩，已积好各种肥料十一万七千一百二十九担。从平均数字看来每亩已达到七十担，数量已相当多。但是从每户的具体情况来看，有的还缺得很多。有三十户每亩积肥三十来担，有十三户每亩积肥还不到二十担；（二）农民燃料不足。全村一百六十多户，有六十五户所存燃料，至多只能烧到三月底。另有很多户当下就没烧的；（三）农具不足。估计全村要缺镢头十把，大锹十四张。铁?五个，耢两面，箩头十一付及其它农具共五十四件。
    经过这样深入的检查，桥头村的干部们和在生产中起积极作用的共产党员们都大吃一惊，打消了盲目的自满情绪，他们说：“可不敢再麻痹自满了，更不能光从一般数字上来看问题了。这些具体户的具体问题如不设法解决，增产计划就难完成。”经过干部和群众讨论，全村又重新订出在下种前四十五天的春耕生产计划。这个计划，规定在二月初五日以前，大量压圪渣造肥料，帮助肥料不足的户熏荒肥一万担，买麻饼四千斤。全村要准备好四月底以前的燃料。以此标准计算，全村共缺煤四百五十车。全村五十四辆车一齐出动，从二月初五日至十四日可以运齐。农具的不足，则由村供销社负责组织铁匠、木匠修打或统一向外购买，保证不误春耕使用。新的计划还定出了春耕工作的程序：二月十五到三月初十打土块，耙荏子，并把一部积存雪水的硬地不带犁面先犁一遍，三月初十后开始犁地。在此时期，妇女们要准备好春耕期间的鞋袜和米面，帮助翻晒种籽。劳动模范、技术能手则进行发芽试验与调换优良品种的工作。
    这个计划曾经过村各界人民代表会议审查修改，又召开了全村农民大会进行了讨论。农民们都说：这个春耕计划真是订的实在，如果今后都能这样作，增产就有把握了。现全村正按照这个计划进行春耕。
