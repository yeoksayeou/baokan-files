Workers Welcome Works Like "Dragon Beard Ditch"

Comrade Editor:

We are a group of printing workers, along with several proofreaders, guards, correspondents, and service personnel, most of whom are Beijing natives. We have all seen the play "Dragon Beard Ditch," and afterwards held a discussion to exchange our opinions. We all think it's a good play.

What makes "Dragon Beard Ditch" good? We think there are three main points:

    First, "Dragon Beard Ditch" depicts the life of the urban working people, which is very familiar to most of us. The characters in the play are very lifelike, as if they are our neighbors in the same courtyard, or our relatives and friends, and some even seem like ourselves. Some of us grew up in the "big courtyards" of Beijing. In the "poor eight families" of the big courtyard, everyone has their own occupation. Before liberation, everyone was running around all day, still unable to "make ends meet," and every family inevitably argued like the Ding Si couple. We have personally seen how local ruffians oppressed the people, and some have even personally suffered from their bullying. Take service worker Dai Xiuqing, for example, her brother was once harassed by two hooligans, beaten, and imprisoned, almost ruining the family. She said, "I hate Feng Gouzi as soon as I see him." Some of us even lived in Dragon Beard Ditch. Take service worker Wang Dequan, for example, he used to be a weaving apprentice there for three years before liberation. He said, "That's no place for people to live. When it rained heavily, it was like the Yellow River bursting its banks, a vast expanse of water, houses collapsed, people were killed, and water drowned people. Watermelon peels, vegetables, garbage, and debris were washed all over the streets. After the water receded, the kangs and window sills were covered with maggots. Who knew how bitter and dirty it was before! Now, Mr. Lao She has written about it."

    Second, "Dragon Beard Ditch" portrays the noble qualities of the working people. This noble quality is especially manifested in class friendship. In this small courtyard, there are four families, a total of nine people, but they are very united and help each other. In times of crisis, they even help each other with swords. Take the most backward Wang Da Ma for example. When she fled the flood to the teahouse, she was holding her package and carrying her basket, muttering about the soldering iron she had left at home. However, when the Ding Si family had nothing to eat, she quickly sent half a basin of cornmeal.

    Third, "Dragon Beard Ditch" describes the difference between the old and new societies, and how the new society transforms people. In the old society, the place was so dirty and smelly that the Kuomintang government still collected sanitation donations. In the new society, the People's Government "came to repair the ditch silently without asking for money." In the old society, good people could not make a living. Cheng the Madman was driven crazy and could not perform and sell his art; in the new society, he found a job and even told allegro at the celebration meeting. In the old society, Feng Gouzi relied on his master's power to bully and beat people; in the new society, he reformed and worked hard. In the old society, Ding Si drank, quarreled, and did not do his job properly; in the new society, he became a worker, and his husband and wife were harmonious. All these changes are because the people overthrew the old regime and established the People's Government. When expressing this theme, "Dragon Beard Ditch" is not generalized. Unlike some plays, when a cadre in a gray uniform comes on stage, it means that the government belongs to the people. From the fact that Zhao Laotou became a government member and Liu Patrolman became the deputy director of the police station, we can clearly see the fundamental change in the regime, which also happens to illustrate that the People's Government is a government where the people are the masters.

We welcome "Dragon Beard Ditch" and works like "Dragon Beard Ditch." We hope that this play will be widely performed in the residential areas of urban working people, and we hope that literary and art workers will write more works like "Dragon Beard Ditch."

In addition, we have a few small opinions on "Dragon Beard Ditch": The first act is before liberation, and the second act is after liberation, and there is a lack of clear explanation in between. We suggest adding a scene between the two acts, using firecrackers, liberation songs and other effects to indicate this change. Secondly, Hei Xuanfeng was arrested. It is best to imply how the government will deal with him. Because we hate these counter-revolutionary elements and are very concerned about their whereabouts. Finally, before liberation, Er Gaizi seemed to be carrying a basket in and out, indicating that he was a coal picker. He was the only one in the whole play who had nothing to do, unlike the son of a working people.

### 工人欢迎像《龙须沟》这样的作品

专栏：读者来信

　　工人欢迎像《龙须沟》这样的作品编辑同志：
    我们是一群印刷工人，也有几个是校对员、警卫员、通讯员和勤务员，大部分是北京人。我们都看了话剧《龙须沟》，后来还开了一个漫谈会，交换了一下意见。大家认为这是一个好戏。
    《龙须沟》好在哪里呢？我们觉得主要有这样三点：
    一、《龙须沟》表现了城市劳动人民的生活，这对我们大部分人是十分熟悉的。戏里的角色都演得很像，仿佛不是我们的同院邻居，就是我们的亲戚朋友，有的甚至很像是我们自己。我们当中，有的就是在北京的大杂院里长大的。大杂院，“穷八家”，各人有各人的行业。解放前，大家整天奔波，还“揭不开锅”，每家人家免不了要像丁四夫妇一样吵架。我们亲眼见过地痞流氓怎样欺压人民，有的还亲身受过他们的欺侮。像勤务员戴秀清吧，她的哥哥就曾经被两个流氓找过岔子，挨过打，坐过牢，几乎弄得家破人亡。她说：“我一看见冯狗子，就恨死了。”我们当中，有的还在龙须沟那儿住过家。像勤务员王德泉吧，他在解放前，曾经在那儿当过三年织布学徒。他说：“那儿哪是人住的地方啊，一下大雨，就像黄河决了口一样，一片汪洋大水，房塌屋倒，砸死人，淹死人，西瓜皮、青菜、垃圾、杂物，冲得满街都是。水一退，炕上，窗台上，爬满了蛆。那个苦劲儿、脏劲儿，以前谁知道啊！现在，老舍先生写出来了。”
    二、《龙须沟》写出了劳动人民高贵的品质。这种高贵的品质特别表现在阶级友爱上。这个小杂院里，一共住了四家，大大小小九口人，却很团结互助。遇有危难，甚至拔刀相助。就拿最落后的王大妈说吧，逃大水逃到茶馆里的时候，她抱着包袱，挽着篮子，叨念着丢在家里没有带来的烙铁。可是，当丁四家吃不上饭的时候，她赶紧送去了半盆棒子面。
    三、《龙须沟》写出了新旧社会的不同，和新社会怎样改造人。在旧社会，地方那么脏，那么臭，国民党政府还要收卫生捐。在新社会，人民政府“还没要钱，就不言不语地来修沟”了。在旧社会，好人吃不开，程疯子被气疯了，不能登台卖艺；在新社会，他找到了事，还在庆祝大会上说快板。在旧社会，冯狗子狗仗人势，欺人打人；在新社会，他改邪归正，积极工作。在旧社会，丁四喝酒吵架，不务正道；在新社会，他当了工人，夫妻也和美了。所有这些改变都是因为人民推翻了旧政权，建立了人民政府的原故。《龙须沟》在表现这一主题时，并不一般化，它不像有些戏一样，台上来了一个穿灰制服的干部，就算是政府属于人民了。我们从赵老头当了政府委员、刘巡长当了派出所副所长这两件事上，可以清楚地看出政权的根本改变，而这也恰好说明了人民政府是人民自己作主的政府。
    我们欢迎《龙须沟》，欢迎像《龙须沟》这样的作品。我们希望这个戏在城市中劳动人民居住的地方普遍上演，更希望文艺工作者多多地写出像《龙须沟》这样的作品来。
    此外，我们对《龙须沟》还有几点小意见：头一幕是在解放前，第二幕是在解放后，其间还缺少明显的交代。我们建议在两幕之间，加一过场，用鞭炮声，解放歌曲等效果来表示这个改变。其次，黑旋风被捕了，政府究竟如何处理，最好也要暗示一下。因为我们恨死了这些反革命分子，十分关心他们的下落。最后二嘎子在解放前，出出进进似应挎个篮子，表示他是检煤核的，全剧就只他一人没有事干，不像劳动人民的儿子。
    黄文龙、刘敬杰、张恩铭、禹平、方开平、徐景弼、张居生、李培安、吴润堂、胡仲康、杨春长、张恩林、戴秀清、王德泉等共三十二人
