　　Patriotic Ideological Education in Beijing Secondary Schools
    Bai Sheng

    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, all secondary schools in Beijing, under the promotion of the Party, the Youth League, and administrative bodies, have become universally involved in this movement. Students have enthusiastically signed up to join the Volunteer Army. Student propaganda teams from various schools have gone to the streets, factories, and rural areas in the suburbs to carry out propaganda, conduct home visits, and create a large number of allegros, skits, and other literary and artistic works. Some schools have also held large-scale exhibitions, using cartoons, charts, models, slides, and other forms to conduct propaganda among students, further clarifying the hideous features of American imperialism. At the same time, schools have mobilized the masses to write letters of慰问 (wèiwèn,congratulations/sympathy) to the Volunteer Army, sew 慰问 (wèiwèn,congratulations/sympathy) bags, and hold accusation meetings. Many students enthusiastically participated in military cadre schools. This fully demonstrates the patriotic spirit of the young students.

    During this movement, middle school teachers strengthened their study of current affairs and universally launched discussions. At the same time, they began to systematically and deeply carry out patriotic ideological education for students in various subjects.

    First, the content of teaching began to be enriched, increasing students' love for the motherland. In terms of political classes, current affairs education was the focus, and schools universally studied "How to Understand the United States?" In terms of Chinese language, schools selected articles and literary works related to Resist America, Aid Korea as supplementary teaching materials in addition to textbooks. They also taught documents such as the joint declaration of various democratic parties and Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations General Assembly. In composition classes, students were asked to write letters of 慰问 (wèiwèn,congratulations/sympathy) to the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army. Teachers also collaborated with students to create dramas, allegros, songs, and skits. History classes focused on teaching the history of American aggression against China and collected relevant historical materials, charts, and tables to provide teachers and students with propaganda materials. Geography classes taught about the national defense and industrial construction of Northeast China, Tibet, Taiwan, and other regions in advance, in order to cultivate students' national self-esteem and make them realize the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. In terms of foreign geography, the geography of countries such as the United States, Korea, and the Soviet Union was taught in advance, and the development of the Korean people's patriotic war was included as part of the teaching content, explaining the close relationship between China and Korea and the aggressive nature of American imperialism. When teaching natural sciences, ideological education on Resist America, Aid Korea was also incorporated. For example, when teaching physics courses, it was explained that the atomic bomb is not as terrible as the enemy claims and that it cannot determine the outcome of the war. In addition, basic knowledge of weapons was explained. Chemistry classes taught defense chemistry. In terms of physical education, simple military techniques were added. Students in some schools automatically organized youth companies and juvenile companies, practiced military life, and exercised their bodies. Music classes selected songs that could inspire patriotic sentiments. Work and art classes cooperated with other subjects to draw many current affairs cartoons and propaganda slogans.

    After this extensive and in-depth patriotic study and propaganda movement, students' understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism was improved, and thoughts of worshipping, fearing, and being friendly to the United States were eliminated. The understanding of teachers and staff was also improved, and they actively joined the movement, specifically guiding students, enriching the content of the movement. It was also combined with the propaganda activities of workers, peasants, and citizens.

    Through this movement, the relationship between teachers and students became closer. For example, some teachers in Municipal No. 4 Middle School were dissatisfied with students in the past, but in this movement, they changed their working attitude and actively participated in various activities, thus gaining the support of the majority of students. In the past, the members of the Communist Youth League in the senior three class of Peimang Girls' Middle School did not have a good relationship with the masses. They believed that the masses were backward and that "talking to them was meaningless." This caused the masses to be unwilling to express their opinions on the work in the class. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, on the one hand, the political awareness of the masses was improved, and on the other hand, the members of the Youth League helped everyone eliminate barriers, and an unprecedented great unity was formed among the students.

    At the same time, teachers and staff also increased their interest in studying current affairs. Many schools increased their subscriptions to newspapers, and almost every teacher and staff member in some schools subscribed to newspapers and current affairs manuals. Teachers' professional studies and current affairs and political studies were also closely integrated, and teachers of various subjects also had close contact. Many teachers automatically organized seminars, and some participated in actual propaganda activities.

    Therefore, this ideological education on Resist America, Aid Korea was more universal and in-depth than any previous one. It not only educated the students and promoted the movement but also educated the teachers, enabling them to further realize the truth that education serves politics. In the future, schools should, on this basis, regularly implement patriotic ideological education in school education.

　　北京市中等学校的爱国主义思想教育
    柏生
    自抗美援朝运动展开以后，北京市各中等学校在党、团，行政等各方面推动下，普遍卷入了这一运动。同学们都纷纷报名参加志愿军。各校学生都组织宣传队分赴街头、工厂、郊区农村宣传，作家庭访问，并创作了大批快板、活报等文艺作品。有的学校还举办了大规模的展览会，利用漫画、图表、模型、幻灯等形式向同学进行宣传，使他们进一步认清美帝国主义的狰狞面貌。同时，各校更发动了广大群众给志愿军写慰问信，缝慰问袋，举行控诉会。广大同学踊跃参加军事干部学校。这充分表现了广大青年学生的爱国主义精神。
    在这一运动中，中学教师们加强了时事学习，并普遍展开了讨论。同时，在各科教学中开始有计划地深入地向同学进行爱国主义的思想教育。
    首先，教学的内容开始丰富了，增加了学生对祖国的热爱。在政治课方面，以时事教育为主，各校普遍学习了“怎样认识美国？”在语文方面，各校在课本之外，选择有关抗美援朝的文章以及文艺作品做为补充教材。并讲授了各民主党派联合宣言和伍修权在联合国大会上的发言等文件。作文课上叫同学写慰问朝鲜人民军和我志愿军的信。教师们并与同学共同创作戏剧、快板、歌词、活报剧等。历史课则以讲授美国侵华史为主，并搜集了有关史料、图表，供给师生们做宣传资料。地理课提前讲授了关于东北、西藏、台湾等地区的国防、工业建设情形，以培养学生的民族自尊心，使学生认识到祖国的伟大和可爱。外国地理方面则将美国、朝鲜、苏联等国地理提前讲授，并把朝鲜人民爱国战争的发展情形作为讲授的内容，说明中朝两国的唇齿关系和美帝国主义的侵略本质。讲授自然科学时，也结合了抗美援朝的思想教育。例如讲授物理课程时，说明原子弹并不像敌人所宣传的那样可怕，它决不能决定战争的胜负。此外又讲解了武器常识。化学课则讲国防化学。体育方面，增添了简单的军事技术。某些学校的同学自动组织了青年连、少年连，练习过军事生活，锻炼体格。音乐课选学了足以鼓舞爱国情绪的歌曲。劳作、美术课配合其他各科画了许多时事漫画和宣传标语。
    经过这一广泛深入的爱国主义学习和宣传运动以后，同学对美帝国主义的侵略本质的认识提高了一步，肃清了崇美、恐美、亲美的思想。教职员的认识也提高了，他们主动、积极地加入到运动中去，具体指导学生，使运动更有了丰富的内容。并把它和工人、农民和市民的宣传活动结合起来。
    通过这次运动，教员和同学间的关系更加密切了。例如，市立四中有的教员过去为学生所不满，但在这次运动中，他们改变了工作态度，积极参加了各种活动，因而得到广大同学的拥护。贝满女中高三班青年团员，过去和群众的关系搞不好，她们认为群众落后，“和她们说话没意思。”因此使群众对班内的工作不愿发表意见。在抗美援朝运动中，一方面由于群众的政治认识提高，另一方面又由于团员们的帮助，使大家消除了隔阂，同学间形成了空前的大团结。
    同时，教职员对时事学习的兴趣也增加了。很多学校都增订了报纸，某些学校几乎每个教职员都订了报纸和时事手册。教师们的业务学习和时事政治学习也密切地结合起来了，各科教员也有了密切的联系。许多教师自动组织了座谈，有的参加了宣传的实际活动。
    因此，这一次抗美援朝的思想教育比过去任何一次都要普遍和深入。它不仅教育了同学，推动了运动，而且也教育了教师，使他们进一步体会了教育为政治服务的这一真理。今后，各校应在这个基础上，把爱国主义的思想教育经常贯彻到学校教育中去。
