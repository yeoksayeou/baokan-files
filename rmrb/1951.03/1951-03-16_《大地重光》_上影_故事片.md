    In August 1945, due to the efforts of the people nationwide, and due to the Soviet Red Army's entry into Northeast China, we defeated Japanese imperialism. To fulfill the urgent demands for peace and unity by the people of the whole country, and to avoid civil war and strive for peace, the New Fourth Army followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee to transfer the Jiangnan troops to the north of the Yangtze River. It was at that time that the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the Double Tenth Agreement, launching an attack on the New Fourth Army during its transfer. The New Fourth Army in the Siming Mountains of eastern Zhejiang, with the support and help of the people, safely withdrew from Jiangnan. Only Zhou Qiang, the political instructor of a certain column, along with machine gunner Lao Shen, and medic Yang Yuwen, stayed behind to cover the retreat of wounded soldiers Chen Guangsheng, Guo Zhiying, Sun Erhu, and Yuan Xuewu. As a result, they were discovered by the enemy, so they went into hiding and began to fight. In the face of overwhelming odds, they were captured. An enemy detachment escorted them into the Siming Mountains.

    They spent the night in a small village to avoid the rain. The enemy then launched an attack into the mountainous area, burning, killing, and looting along the way, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Instructor Zhou and the others received help from the people, killed the enemy squad leader, and thus defeated the enemy. In this battle, they re-armed themselves, and the excess guns and ammunition were buried. In the battle, platoon leader Yuan Xuewu gloriously sacrificed himself. The other six people struggled to climb over the mountains. On the way, Chen Guangsheng, whose eyes were injured, and Sun Erhu, whose hand was injured, advanced with the help of Instructor Zhou, Lao Shen, and Yang Yuwen. Only Guo Zhiying, unable to endure the hardships and suffering, wavered somewhat and became fearful. But the instructor's words: "How did the Red Army complete the 25,000-li Long March? Can it be said that we are more miserable and face greater difficulties today than they did? Chairman Mao said: 'They got up from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the corpses of their comrades, and they continued to fight!'" educated him. The glorious death of Platoon Leader Yuan educated him, and the comrades' friendship encouraged him, so he did not fall behind, but pressed on to catch up with his comrades. They hid in Zhugongguan (bamboo forests) and Shigongguan (stone caves), living a hard life and fighting hard. Finally, they met with farmers who had taken refuge in the mountains, and then the people's armed forces were organized again. The weapons that had been buried were once again in the hands of the people. They joined forces with the guerrillas led by County Magistrate Ma, and established a guerrilla base. Their numbers grew with each battle, and their strength became greater with each war. In 1949, the People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and continued to advance south. Instructor Zhou and the others who remained in the mountains mobilized to cooperate with the army's offensive. At the same time, in order to connect with the army, Yang Yuwen disguised herself as a fisherman's daughter and, with farmer Zhang Daye, sailed a small boat across the river at night. Enemy soldiers on the shore fired dense artillery fire at the boat. The boat sank, and Zhang Daye sacrificed himself. Yang Yuwen swam across the river after the boat sank, and finally found her own army.

    Fierce battles, victory after victory. The people's armed forces who persisted in the Siming Mountain area joined forces with the People's Liberation Army. The red flag flew again in the Siming Mountains, and the people saw the light again. Chen Guangsheng, whose eyes were injured, excitedly broke free from his bandages, shouting: "My eyes are bright!"

    一九四五年八月，由于全国人民的努力，由于苏联红军的出兵东北，我们战胜了日本帝国主义，为了全国人民迫切的要求和平团结，为了避免内战和争取和平，新四军遵守党中央的指示，把江南部队转移到江北去。就在那时候，国民党反动派撕毁了双十协定，在新四军转移的时候，出动围击；浙东四明山区的新四军在人民的支援下、帮助下安全的撤离江南。只有某纵队的指导员周强与机枪手老沈，医护员杨玉文为了掩护伤员陈光生、郭志英、孙二虎、袁学武撤退，结果没有赶得及，却为敌人发现了，于是他们就隐蔽起来展开了战斗；在众寡不敌的情势中，他们都被俘了。敌人一个分队押了他们来，他们进了四明山。
    在一个小村中过夜避雨，敌人又发动了向山区进周指导员他们得到了人民攻，沿途烧杀抢掠，无恶的帮助，打死了敌分队长不做。周强他们奋力抵抗，缴了敌人的枪械，这样，把敌人击溃了。在这次他们又重新武装了自己，战斗中，袁学武排长殉了多余的枪械弹药都埋了起难，其他六个人艰难地爬过山岭。在途中，双目受伤的陈光生，与一手受伤的孙二虎在周指导员、老沈、杨玉文的帮助下前进着。只有郭志英他受不住艰难、困苦有些动摇，有些畏惧，但是指导员的话：“红军二万五千里长征是怎么走的呢？难道说我们今天比他们更苦更艰难吗？毛主席说：他们从地上爬起来，擦干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了！”教育了他，袁排长光荣的死教育了他，同志们的友爱鼓舞了他，使他没有掉队，追赶着前进着的同志们前进了。他们隐避在竹公馆（竹林）石公馆（石洞）里，艰苦的生活，艰苦的战斗着，终于会见了避难上山的农民们，于是人民的武装又组织起来了，以前埋藏起的武器又掌握在人民的手里，他们又与马县长领导着的游击队会合在一起，建立了游击根据地。他们的人是越打越多，力量是越战越强大了。一九四九年，解放军雄师胜利的渡过了长江，继续向南前进，留在山区的周指导员他们配合了大军的进攻动员了；同时为了与大军连系，杨玉文扮成了渔家女与农民张大爷架着小船黑夜过江去，岸上的敌兵用密集的炮火向小船施放，船沉了，张大爷牺牲了，杨玉文在船沉后游过江去，终于找到了自己的大军。
    激烈的战斗，胜利再胜利，坚持在四明山山区的人民武装与解放大军会师了，红旗又飘扬在四明山，人民重新看见了光明，双目受伤的陈光生也狂喜地挣脱了绑带，喊着：“我的眼睛亮了！”
