Column: Reaction to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily

To the Editor:

The People's Daily published a reader's letter by Comrade Zhang Jixian on January 30th in the "Letters from Readers" column, criticizing the Tianjin Xinhua Bag Company for delaying wages to workers in disaster areas. This criticism is fundamentally correct. We hereby submit the facts and our self-criticism for publication.

Xinhua Bag Company is a joint public-private enterprise. To help the people in disaster areas engage in production for self-relief, we signed a contract with Zhang Shijun, a representative from Beicai Village, Fourth District, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, on October 1st last year for spinning thread processing, which played a significant role in both production and disaster relief. In November of the same year, due to a dispute between the public and private partners, the company suspended operations on the 23rd, making it impossible to pay for the raw materials and processing wages owed to Beicai Village, causing hardship for the disaster-stricken people. What was particularly wrong was that when the village leader inquired when we would repay the processing wages, we brushed him off with irresponsible statements such as "in three to five days" and "will be resolved soon." We have now conducted a self-criticism regarding this.

Since January 26th of this year, after the company was placed under the trusteeship of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government's Publicly Operated Industry Bureau, the 9,671 *jin* of weft yarn delivered by the village, with wages equivalent to RMB 7,756,383 yuan, has been fully repaid. The outstanding processing wages for 7,983 *jin* of weft yarn owed to the village from November 15th of last year to January 25th of this year, equivalent to RMB 6,402,565 yuan (the 17 million plus yuan reported in the newspaper has some discrepancy with the actual amount), have also been settled. According to the ruling of the Tianjin Municipal People's Court regarding the debt settlement of the company, wages for workers and processing wages for weft yarn should be given priority over other debts.

Since the company was placed under the trusteeship of the Tianjin Municipal Industry Bureau, a new weft yarn processing contract has been signed with the village on February 4th. The village has now resumed spinning production.

### 天津新华制袋公司  对拖欠灾区工人工资的答复

　　天津新华制袋公司
    对拖欠灾区工人工资的答复
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月三十日《读者来信》栏刊载张继先同志对天津新华制袋公司拖欠灾区工人工资的批评。这一批评基本上是正确的。兹将事实经过及我们的检讨奉上，请予刊登。
    新华制袋公司是公私合营的，为了帮助灾区人民生产自救，于去年十月一日曾与河北省武清县第四区北蔡村代表张士俊订立纺线加工合同，在生产上和救灾上都起了很大的作用。同年十一月间，本公司因公私纠纷，于二十三日停工，对北蔡村的原料及加工工资均无法发付，使灾民生活遭受困难；尤其错误的，是当该村负责人询问我们何时发还加工工资时，我们竟以“三、五日”、“近日解决”等不负责任的话语相搪塞。现在我们对此已作了检讨。
    自本年一月二十六日，本公司由天津市人民政府公营工业管理局代管后，该村所交加工纬线九、六七一市斤，工资折合人民币七、七五六、三八三元，已如数发还。自去年十一月十五日起至本年一月二十五日止共欠该村七、九八三市斤纬线的加工工资折合人民币六、四○二、五六五元（报上所载一千七百余万元，与实际略有出入）也已结算。依天津市人民法院对本公司债务清理的裁定，对工人工资及纬线加工工资，应较其他债务优先清偿。
    本公司自经天津市工业局代管后，已于二月四日另行与该村签订纬线加工新合同。现在该村已经恢复了纺线生产工作。
