　　Several Situations in Henan's Rural Areas After the Land Reform
　　Zhang Xi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
　　Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Xi's report on his investigation of Henan's rural areas after land reform is an excellent one. He provides a profound analysis of the new face of the countryside after land reform in the new areas. The situations he investigated and the issues he raised are worthy of study by comrades working in the new areas.
　　On December 12, 1950, I took four cadres to the countryside to observe the production situation and the class dynamics in rural areas after the land reform. I returned to Kaifeng on the 31st, for a total of twenty days. I spent seven days looking in detail at Li Kou Township (a top-tier township) in Jia County; listened to reports from four townships, namely Zhangdian Township (second-tier township) in Jia County, Laoyachen Township (top-tier township) in Zheng County, and Zuzhuang Township (second-tier township) and Dazhang Township (top-tier township) in Xuchang County, which were investigated by Comrades Zhou Yubo and Wu Chunyu, etc.; I also listened to reports from two counties and one prefectural committee; and went to Pingyuan Province to exchange views on rural production issues. Because of the short time, the small number of places visited, and the lack of experience, the situations and opinions are very limited and one-sided. I hereby present a brief report of the materials seen and some preliminary considerations as follows:

  I. The slogan of increasing agricultural production by 10% has been basically achieved.
　　In areas where land reform was completed by the end of 1949 (such as the seven counties of Xuchang, etc.), agricultural production has recovered to pre-war levels. Areas where land reform was completed before the wheat harvest in 1950 also approached the pre-war levels. For example, last year's production increased by 10% to 20% compared to the previous year (Laoyachen and Zuzhuang 10%, Zhangdian 12%, Li Kou 14%, Xiangcheng Shuangmiao 20%), which is slightly higher than before the war. The labor force has also increased significantly. Taking male laborers alone, Zhangdian increased by 15% compared to before the war, and Li Kou increased by 19%. Before the war, those who had labor but did not participate in labor accounted for 14%, and this phenomenon has basically been eliminated. Currently, each laborer farms six to eight mu of land. At the same time, women's participation in agricultural labor has become a common phenomenon, so there is a surplus of labor. The number of livestock is higher than before the war, but the quality is worse. Li Kou increased by 5%, Laoyachen increased by 17%, and Zhangdian increased by 30%. Each head of livestock farms an average of 15 to 20 mu of land, which is sufficient. In addition, there are some small livestock that are not included. The number of farm tools has generally recovered to pre-war levels, but is still not enough (such as carts, plows, seeders, etc.). Fertilization and cultivation have also caught up with pre-war levels. However, cash crops have decreased. For example, tobacco accounted for about 20% of the cultivated land before the war, but only 2% to 3% last year. It is planned to plant 5% to 10% this year (due to the impact of the low prices last spring and the increased proportion of grain planting area after the land was distributed).
　　The recovery of rural side occupations, handicrafts, and commerce is uneven. Some have exceeded pre-war levels, some are close to pre-war levels, and some are being reorganized. The general rule is: those with small capital, low technology, and direct connections with agriculture (such as pig raising, weaving, tofu workshops, flour mills, cotton ginning machines, cotton batting machines, dyeing workshops) have greatly exceeded pre-war levels (about double); those with higher technology, larger capital, or difficult lives and low profits have recovered more slowly (such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons, close to pre-war levels), or have decreased significantly (such as transportation). Commerce is being reorganized. Most of the businesses that served the landlord class have collapsed (restaurants, grocery stores), and those that serve the peasants are developing (such as oil and salt), but have not yet recovered and are still far behind pre-war levels (such as Li Kou, which had 57 small businesses before the war, now has 25); and cooperatives have begun to be established, but have not yet played a major role.
　　Due to the recovery and development of production, most peasants have a surplus in their lives. They have paid off their debts, bought some livestock and farm tools. The peasants themselves say: "After land reform, we have enough to eat in one year, add utensils in two years, and have a surplus in three years." This estimate is not high.
　　The reasons for the increase in agricultural production and the recovery of side occupations and handicrafts are: (1) The peasants have production materials, have been allocated land and some livestock and farm tools, and have bought some livestock and farm tools; (2) The production policy is correct, dispelling the concerns of "fear of another land reform" and "fear of rising," stabilizing production sentiment; (3) The masses have high enthusiasm for production, and the labor force has increased; (4) The masses' mutual assistance and labor exchange have solved many difficulties in production; (5) Government support, such as loans (Li Kou's various loans totaled 42,000 jin of grain, Laoyachen 15,600 jin) and rewards for special products, etc.; (6) The burden is lighter than in the past (especially in autumn); (7) A peaceful environment, greatly reducing war service and dispatch; (8) The leadership grasped several key links in production: such as accumulating fertilizer in spring, spring plowing, timely harvesting of wheat and planting of autumn crops in the wheat season, digging wells to fight drought in summer and autumn, draining water when flooded, weeding and hoeing more, and timely planting wheat and autumn plowing after autumn. The above is subjective effort; (9) The rainfall is generally even, which is an objective condition for possible harvest. Subjective effort is the main reason for increased production. Therefore, the masses in Li Kou said: "Chairman Mao leads well, our common people work well, the public grain is light, and life is good."
　　The current economic demands of the masses are: having grain but no money, low grain prices, expensive farm tools, coal shortage, requesting loans to buy farm tools and engage in transportation, requesting contracts for planting tobacco, etc. For areas like Jia County, the direction for further production improvement in the future is still to increase agricultural production by 10% and restore side occupations and trade. The main things to do are: (1) Increase land processing and production, in addition to accumulating more fertilizer, hoeing and plowing more, and timely harvesting and planting, it is also necessary to start water conservancy projects (building canals or digging wells) and improve technology (such as seed selection, seed soaking, and seed mixing, etc.); (2) Appropriately expand the area of cash crops (tobacco, cotton, indigo, etc.); (3) Restore side occupations, according to local conditions; (4) Develop labor mutual assistance; (5) Restore trade, develop supply and marketing cooperatives, and restore private businesses that serve the peasants. The general situation is that 80% of the cultivated land is planted with enough grain to eat, and women weave enough to wear. If the area of cash crops can be expanded, side occupations can be improved, and trade can be restored, then life will be very surplus.

  II. Land reform is also an economic revolution.
　　The experience of one year of production after land reform proves that the new rural economy of self-cultivating small farmers is far superior to the old rural economy of landlord ownership and tenant farming, and quickly increased production. Because the state of separation of labor, tools, and land has moved to a state of combination of labor, tools, and land, which greatly increased labor and improved labor enthusiasm. In the past, production was higher among middle peasants, and after land reform, everyone is moving towards middle peasantization. The masses also understand this principle. They said: "In the past, poor peasants had little land and had to do carrying business, so the land was not well planted. Tenants who planted a lot of land did rough work, and the landlord would not let them apply more fertilizer. Now everyone plants their own land, and the fertilizer and work are better than before." However, the small-scale peasant economy also has its shortcomings, such as being easily conservative, easily differentiated, difficult to improve technology, and difficult to expand the area of cash crops, etc. From the actual experience of existing mutual aid groups, the mutual aid groups organized on the basis of private and individual economy have great advantages over individual work (if combined with supply and marketing cooperation, the advantages will be even greater).
　　The following specifically discusses the situation of mutual aid groups. Li Kou, Zhangdian, Laoyachen, Zuzhuang, and Dazhang townships are in three different situations: although forced mutual assistance has occurred in all of them, Li Kou and Zhangdian made self-criticisms among the masses after the mutual aid groups forcibly organized collapsed, and proposed voluntary combination, so normal labor mutual assistance has developed again. For example, Li Kou has 65 mutual aid groups, and the members account for 46% of the total households; Laoyachen forced mutual assistance, organized 31 large groups, most of which collapsed, and because the leadership did not further study, there was no new development, but there are still two left, because they themselves need it very much and the leadership in the group is better; Zuzhuang and Dazhang did not promote mutual aid groups after the mutual aid groups forcibly organized collapsed, so there are no mutual aid groups. Each township has a common feature, that is, temporary old-style mutual assistance during the busy season of wheat harvesting and autumn planting is large, accounting for more than 80% of the households. Therefore, forcing is wrong, and letting it flow freely is also wrong. The development process of Li Kou's 65 mutual aid groups can be divided into three categories: one category is old-style agricultural mutual assistance, with 7 groups, which are large households leading small households, characterized by large households (middle peasants) having carts and cattle, and small households (poor peasants) only having land, exchanging cattle work for manual labor, but not at equal value, without democracy; the second category is new-style agricultural mutual assistance, with 53 groups, that is, both cattle and people help each other, agricultural work is done together, and side occupations are done separately, although the work is not counted, but the numbers are known in the heart, basically at equal value, with democracy; the third category is mutual assistance combining agriculture and side occupations, with 5 groups, that is, agriculture and side occupations (main ones) are all done together. The former two categories are large in other townships in Jia County, and the third category is individual. The development process of mutual aid groups is generally from temporary to relatively fixed, from old to new, from agriculture to side occupations, from solving difficulties to improving production, from not counting work to starting to count work. Having it is better than not having it, new is better than old, high is better than low, forced is bound to fail, and letting it flow freely will also lose the direction of labor mutual assistance; but while promoting labor mutual assistance, it is also necessary to allow individual work and protect individual work.
　　Labor mutual assistance organized on the basis of private and individual economy can both maintain the advantages of the self-cultivating small-scale peasant economy and make up for its shortcomings. From the mutual aid groups in these townships, its advantages are that it can solve the difficulties of lacking livestock, farm tools, and threshing grounds; organize labor, develop competition, and improve production efficiency; it is easy to combine with side occupations, easy to purchase farm tools (such as carts and large cattle), and improve technology (seed selection, pest control, and water conservancy); it can rise together and prevent polarization. It has now been proven that the turned-over poor peasants are stronger when working together than when working alone. If it can be further achieved in the future that working together is stronger than working alone even for middle peasants, it will further prove the superiority of being organized.
　　From the key to the success or failure of the mutual aid groups in these townships, there are mainly two experiences: (1) The composition of the mutual aid group must be based on four principles: one is need; two is voluntary; three is mutual benefit (do not emphasize counting work at the beginning); four is that the members in the group should be appropriate, not too many (four to eight households), and the economic conditions should be roughly the same, not too far apart. (2) The selection of the group leader is very important: one must be politically strong, that is, selfless, taking into account both public and private interests, and able to solve problems in a timely manner; two must be able to organize production; three must understand technology and be able to take the lead; four must have a certain economic status, be able to be the head of the household, and have certain means of production. The first two points are the main ones, and the latter two are secondary. Whether poor peasants or middle peasants, those who have these conditions do well, otherwise they do not do well. Mutual aid groups that meet the conditions for composition and have good group leaders can continuously improve production (adding livestock, buying farm tools, engaging in side occupations), establish a democratic system, solve problems in a timely manner, and consolidate the organization, otherwise they often collapse midway.
　　I suggest that after the land reform, we should call for getting organized (never allow coercion), solving difficulties, and both new and old types are acceptable. Here, there are actually a large number of old forms and a small number of new forms, so there is a possibility of gradual development. In areas like Jia County, we should use examples to call on those who have not joined mutual assistance to join mutual assistance, and those who have joined mutual assistance to gradually improve, and combine with supply and marketing cooperatives. Currently, the large amount is to develop new agricultural mutual assistance, and a small amount is to promote combination with side occupations and technology.

  III. Class struggle in rural areas has not stopped after land reform.
　　Under the new class relations are new forms of struggle. Peasants are the rulers, and landlords are the ruled. The enemy's activities are basically in two forms: one is general class struggle, using bribery, enticement, instigation, and threats, etc., to infiltrate the township government, win over township cadres, defeat them one by one, gradually erode, and covertly or openly usurp leadership, in order to achieve the purpose of restoration and settling accounts. Its characteristic is that the landlords dare not come forward openly, but find agents from the peasants, using the hands of the peasants to implement the policies of the landlords; the other is counter-revolutionary activities, mainly in the form of secret agents, secret societies, and "underground armies," etc., who usually hide and lurk, trying to take the opportunity to launch riots. These two are closely related. After the land reform, the class consciousness of the peasant class in most villages is high, and they have maintained a considerable degree of vigilance and militancy. In better villages, there is a compulsory labor system for landlords, a control method for the reactionaries, and illegal activities can be exposed and struggled against in a timely manner. However, peasants have weaknesses, such as feudal clans, superstition, low culture, and some people have bad work styles, etc., which are all gaps that landlords can exploit.
　　In the past six months, the enemy's activities have intensified. When the Korean War began and the US imperialism landed at Inchon, the enemy twice spread rumors to launch a counter-attack. Landlords in the top and second-tier townships showed that they did not listen to orders, and some carried out bribery, settling accounts, and were arrogant; in the third-tier townships, they usurped leadership and openly settled accounts. Peasants in the top and second-tier townships, on the one hand, blamed the higher authorities for not supporting them and blamed them for not having leadership, and on the other hand, they still fought and retaliated; in the third-tier townships, because bad elements were in power, the masses did not dare to speak. The reasons for this situation are: (1) Cadres are busy with rectification, and the masses are busy with production. Although two propaganda offensives have been launched, the control and struggle against landlords has been relaxed; (2) Excessive leniency has made bad people think that they cannot be dealt with, and they are arrogant; (3) After the land reform, the peasant association organization has become lax, and the masses have lost the reliance of class organizations; (4) After the rectification of cadres, the line between democracy for the people and dictatorship over the enemy is not clear, and they are bound hand and foot; (5) The direct impact of the situation. However, since December last year, due to the arrest of a large number of counter-revolutionaries and bullies, and due to the launch of mass struggles against bullying, settling accounts, and restoration when issuing land certificates, the situation has changed, the peasants' morale has greatly increased, and the landlords have bowed their heads and become honest again.
　　Therefore, after the land reform, it is necessary to strengthen the dictatorship and implement the struggle against the enemy. On the one hand, purify and consolidate the ranks of peasants from the organizational and ideological aspects to improve combat effectiveness; on the other hand, launch struggles on two fronts against the enemy in a tit-for-tat manner. One front is to launch class struggle against the landlord class, treating different landlords differently. From the situation of the landlords in these townships, there are four types: one is those who have counter-revolutionary activities (individual), and should be resolutely suppressed; two is those who do not act honestly (a few), and should be resolutely controlled; three is those who act legally but do not submit ideologically (most), and should be reformed through labor; four is those who want to work, want to surrender, and want to lean towards the peasants (individual), and can be treated leniently; another front is the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle, paying attention to reconnaissance and disintegration in peacetime, and proactively solving cases and making arrests when the situation is tense (such as spring famine, fluctuations in the situation, etc.).

  IV. Organizational construction (that is, the issue of democracy) after land reform is also an important issue.
　　The Li Kou branch has begun to solve the problem of being "sandwiched between three sides" and has learned to divide leadership. Zhangdian, Laoyachen, and Dazhang are second, able to work, but more chaotic. Zuzhuang is the worst, the core among the township cadres is not strong, and the organization is lax, so once there is work, the whole village is in chaos. The following discusses several main issues:
　　Party building, in Li Kou, has begun to solve a leadership problem, that is, "division of labor and responsibility" and "leading whatever you know." There is a division of labor in the departments, a division of labor between superiors and subordinates, and when the masses have something to do, they first solve it from the group; whatever special skills the party members have, they use their special skills to lead relevant work, so that the problem of a few people being busy and most people being idle is solved, and everyone does the work, so the cadres can "not delay work or production." Therefore, the cadres are happy and the masses are happy. Other townships have not yet solved this problem, but the branches can become the core of the township's leadership. In addition to solving the leadership method, it is also necessary to solve the problem of improving thinking and rectifying the organization. Because after the land reform, party members do not know what to do, cannot see a distant future, and it seems that the revolution is over after the land reform. Individual party members (such as two in Li Kou) requested to withdraw from the party. However, there are also individual outstanding individuals who have not yet joined the party but whose conditions are quite mature and should be admitted to the party.
　　Each of these townships has a Communist Youth League branch, which is very active. The Communist Youth League in Li Kou focuses on mastering the militia, carrying out propaganda and learning, and in some townships, the Communist Youth League is inseparable from the Party.
　　The problem of peasant associations and people's congresses is a problem that has not yet been solved. The peasant associations have become lax and scattered, and although there are township people's congresses, the democratic content is very insufficient, and they have mainly become organizations for carrying out administrative tasks. Therefore, the peasant associations must be consolidated after the land reform and become the main organization for peasants to carry out class struggle, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and realize democratic life. All major issues should be discussed in the peasant association first, and then discussed and approved by the township people's congress. The people's congress is both a township-level power organ (including wider representation than the peasant association) and an executive organ. Under the township people's congress, representative groups are divided according to regions; when holding meetings, it is not necessary to require all citizens to attend, as long as the work is flexible and convenient, one person from each family is sufficient. Whenever there are matters such as dispatching errands and issuing grain, the representative group can manage the landlords in and around the village on behalf of the village. When a certain period of time has passed, democracy has become a habit, cooperatives and mutual aid groups have been established, the people's congress can gradually replace the role of the peasant association.
　　The Li Kou militia is very good. In addition to controlling landlords and maintaining revolutionary order, they have paid attention to actively engaging in production and strengthening learning (classes every night). However, each person loses about five days and ten nights of work per month. The mutual aid groups have opinions on the militia members. The militia organization should be gradually expanded, unnecessary duties should be reduced, and work loss should be minimized.
　　There are problems with the women's work in these townships. The mobilization of women in the land reform was good, and their participation in agricultural labor in production is active, but they are currently suppressed by feudal habits and have a tendency to become depressed. Husbands restrict their wives from attending meetings, mothers do not allow their daughters to go to school, it is difficult for women to hold meetings, and it is not easy to enroll young women in winter schools, mainly because they are afraid of divorce and afraid that they "cannot be controlled." This problem should be resolutely and step by step solved. It is necessary to draw a clear line and conduct in-depth education. First of all, in the production movement, focus on solving the democratic (criticism and self-criticism) and harmonious (unity is the goal) family problem, oppose abuse, remove the feudal shackles of women, and implement the marriage law step by step. On this issue, adopting a feudal mindset, letting it go, and the attitude of acting for others and being impatient are all wrong.
　　Another is the cultural issue. The lack of culture among township cadres and peasants has become a major obstacle to ideological construction and promoting work. Township clerks who are politically progressive often become independent and do not listen to the township chairman; those who are politically backward often become the target of landlords' "lining from within." Therefore, township cadres generally demand to learn culture. The current method in Li Kou is that township cadres and primary school principals help each other to establish a learning group together. Township cadres learn culture, principals learn work, primary schools also run township night schools (literacy classes), and principals also serve as militia cultural instructors. This method is good. The method of combining township cadres with primary schools can both transform primary schools and improve the culture of township cadres.

  V. There are three main tasks in rural areas after the land reform.
　　From the above materials, the transition from land reform to production is a major change, and both the leadership and the masses have great blindness. Although the results of one year of production are good, and the main tasks grasped by the leadership are also correct, such as publicizing policies, putting forward directions (increasing production by 10%), grasping the key points of production, solving the difficulties of the masses in production, and calling for labor mutual assistance are all very good. However, due to advancing in exploration, many detours have been taken. For example, at the beginning, there was the idea of ​​"taking a breath," thinking that production does not need leadership; then forcibly compiling mutual assistance, trying to find a so-called production line like land reform; then finding a general direction, but relaxing the in-depth focus and abandoning the slogan of "getting organized." When grasping production, the class struggle was relaxed, and when grasping the class struggle (such as the current suppression of counter-revolutionaries and issuing land certificates), production was relaxed again (no plans were made for winter and spring production). In short, the leadership is taking one step at a time, picking up one and dropping the other. The masses' enthusiasm for production is very high, but they always think that production is not so old-fashioned, and they do not understand the new direction of production after the land reform. Therefore, the transition from land reform to production requires a clear presentation of a series of issues. I think the main tasks in rural areas after the land reform are: consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship (democracy must be built, dictatorship must be consolidated), economic construction, and cultural construction (which is also ideological construction at the same time). The three tasks are combined with each other, with economic construction as the center, that is, building a new countryside.

　　土地改革后河南农村的若干情况
    中共河南省委书记  张玺
    编者按：张玺同志关于土地改革后河南农村考察的报告，是很好的一个报告。他把新区土地改革后农村中的面貌，作了深刻的分析，他所调查的情况，所提出的问题，是值得广大新区工作同志加以研究的。
    我于一九五○年十二月十二日带了四个干部下乡，看了看土地改革后的农村生产情况与农村阶级动态，三十一日返开封，来去共二十天。用七天的时间较详细地看了郏县的一个李口乡（头等乡）；听了四个乡的汇报，即郏县的张店乡（二等乡），郑县的老鸦陈乡（头等乡），及周宇博、吴春雨等同志考察的许昌县俎庄乡（二等乡），与大张乡（头等乡）；又听了两个县、一个地委的汇报；并到平原省去了一趟，交换了一下关于农村生产问题的意见。因为时间短，看的数量少，又无经验，故情况与意见有很大的局限性与片面性。兹仅将看到的材料及初步考虑的一些意见简报如下：
  一、农业增产一成的口号基本上是完成了。
    一九四九年底完成土地改革的地区（如许昌等七县），农业生产已恢复了战前水平。一九五○年麦前完成土地改革的地区也接近恢复了战前水平。如去年比前年增产一成至二成（老鸦陈、俎庄一成，张店一成二，李口一成四，襄城双庙二成），比战前稍有增加。劳动力也大大增加，只以男劳力而论，张店较战前增加百分之十五，李口增百分之十九。战前有劳力而不参加劳动者占百分之十四，现在基本上消灭了这一现象。目前每个劳力合地六亩至八亩，同时妇女参加农业劳动已成普遍现象，故劳力是有余的。牲口比战前量多质差，李口增百分之五，老鸦陈增百分之十七，张店增百分之三十，每个牲口平均耕地十五亩至二十亩，已经够用，另外还有一部小牲口未计入。农具大体恢复战前数量，但仍不够用（如大车、犁、耧等），施肥与耕作也赶上战前。但经济作物是减少了，如烟叶战前占耕地百分之二十左右，去年只占耕地百分之二至三，今年拟种百分之五至十（因受到去年春季价格太低的打击与土地分散后种粮面积比例增大）。
    农村副业、手工业及商业的恢复情形是不平衡的，有的超过战前，有的将近战前，有的正在改组。大体规律是：凡本钱不大，技术不高，与农业直接有联系者（如养猪、纺织、豆腐坊、粉坊、轧花机、弹花机、染坊）都大大超过战前水平（一倍左右）；凡技术较高，本钱较大，或生活太苦、赚钱不多者，则恢复较慢（如铁匠、木匠、石匠将近战前），或大大减少（如运输）。商业正在改组，为地主阶级服务的大部垮台（饭馆、杂货），为农民服务的正在发展（如油、盐），但尚未恢复起来，比战前尚差甚远（如李口战前小商五十七家，现在二十五家）；而合作社开始兴办，尚未起大作用。
    由于生产的恢复和发展，多数农民的生活是有富余的。他们还了欠账，买了一些牲口和农具，农民自己说：土地改革后一年够吃，二年添置用具，三年有富余。这一估计是不算高的。
    农业增产，副业手工业恢复的原因是：（１）农民有了生产资料，分到了土地及一部分牲口、农具，并买了一部分牲口、农具；（２）生产政策正确，解除了“怕再土地改革”“怕上升”的顾虑，稳定了生产情绪；（３）群众生产积极性高涨，劳力增多；（４）群众互助变工，解决了生产上许多困难；（５）政府扶助，如贷款（李口各种贷款合计粮食四万二千斤，老鸦陈一万五千六百斤）、奖励特产等；（６）负担比过去减轻了些（特别是秋季）；（７）和平环境，战勤支差大大减少；（８）领导上抓紧了生产上几个主要环节：如春季积肥、春耕，麦季及时收麦种秋，夏秋时打井抗旱，涝了又排水，拔草多锄，秋后及时种麦秋耕，以上是主观努力；（９）雨水大体调匀，这是可能收获的客观条件。主观努力是增产的主要原因。因此李口群众说：“毛主席领导的好，俺们老百姓干的好，公粮出的轻，光景过的好。”
    群众目前的经济要求是：有粮无钱，粮食贱，农具贵，煤太缺，要求贷款买农具，搞运输，要求种烟订合同等。像郏县一类地区，今后生产提高一步的方向，仍是农业增产一成，恢复副业与贸易。主要的应做好下列几件事：（１）土地加工增产，除多积肥、多锄多犁、及时收种外，还要开始兴修水利（修渠或打井），与提高技术（如选种、浸种、拌种等）；（２）适当扩大经济作物面积（烟、棉、靛等）；（３）恢复副业，因地制宜；（４）发展劳动互助；（５）恢复贸易，发展供销合作社，并恢复为农民服务的私商。大体情况是百分之八十的耕地种粮够吃，妇女纺织够穿，如能扩大经济作物，搞好副业，恢复贸易，则生活是大有富余的。
  二、土地改革也是经济上一个革命。
    土地改革后一年生产的经验，证明了自耕的小农式的新农村经济比地主占有、佃户耕种的旧农村经济有很大的优越性，很快地提高了生产。因为由劳力、工具和土地相分离的状态走到劳力、工具和土地相结合的状态，就大大增加了劳力，提高了劳动热情。过去生产就是中农较高，土地改革后大家都是走向中农化。群众也懂得这个道理，他们说：“过去贫农地少，不能不做肩挑生意，故地种不好。佃户种的地多，活作的粗，东佃都不肯多上粪。现在各人种自己的地，上粪作活都比以前好。”但小农经济也有其缺点，如容易保守，容易分化，不易改进技术，不易扩大经济作物的面积等。从已有互助组的实际经验来看，在私有的个体的经济基础上的组织起来的互助组，比单干有很大的优越性（如果与供销合作相结合，其优越性将更大）。
    以下专门把互助组的情况谈谈。李口、张店、老鸦陈、俎庄，大张五个乡是三种不同情况：虽然都曾发生过强迫互助，但李口、张店在强迫组织起来的互助组垮台之后，在群众中做了检讨，提出自愿结合，所以又发展了正常的劳动互助。如李口有互助组六十五个组，组员占总户数百分之四十六；老鸦陈强迫互助，组织了三十一个大组，大部垮了，因领导未进一步研究，故无新的发展，但还剩下二个，因他们本身很需要，且组内领导较好；俎庄、大张强迫组织起来的互助组垮台之后，再未提倡，故无互助组。各乡都有一个共同特点，即麦秋农忙季节的临时性的旧型互助是大量的，占户口百分之八十以上。因此强迫是错误的，自流也是错误的。李口六十五个互助组可分三类：一类是旧型农业互助，有七个组，是大户带小户，其特点是大户（中农）有车、牛，小户（贫农）只有地，牛工换人工，但不等价，无民主；二类是新型的农业互助，有五十三个组，即是牛与人都互助，农业伙干，副业单干，虽不计工，但心中有数，基本上等价，有民主；三类是农业、副业结合的互助，有五个组，即农业、副业（主要的）都伙干。前一、二类在郏县其他乡都是大量的，三类是个别的。互助组发展过程大体是从临时到较固定，从旧型到新型，从农业到副业，从解决困难到提高生产，从不计工到开始计工，有比没有好，新比旧的好，高比低的好，强迫必然失败，自流也会失去劳动互助的发展方向；但在提倡劳动互助的同时，也必须允许单干，保护单干。
    在私有的个体的经济基础上组织起来的劳动互助，既能保持自耕的小农经济的优点，又能弥补其缺点。从这几个乡的互助组看来，其优点是能解决缺牲口、缺农具、缺场的困难；组织劳力，发展竞赛，提高生产效率；容易与副业结合，容易购置农具（如大车、大牛），提高技术（选种、防虫、办水利）；能够一齐上升，防止两极分化。现在已经证明了翻身的贫农伙干比单干强，如果将来能进一步做到伙干比单干的中农也强的话，则更会证明组织起来的优越性。
    从这几个乡互助组的成败关键来看，主要有两条经验：（１）互助组的组成必须根据四个原则：一是需要；二是自愿；三是两利（开始不可强调计工）；四是组内成员要适当，不要太多（四户到八户），经济条件要大体差不多，不要悬殊太远。（２）组长挑选很重要：一要政治强，就是大公无私，公私兼顾，能及时解决问题；二要会组织生产；三要懂得技术，能带头干；四要在经济上有一定地位，能当家做主，有一定生产资料。前两点是主要的，后两点是次要的。不论贫农或中农，凡具有这些条件者，均做得好，否则做不好。凡是合乎组成条件，又有好组长的互助组，就能不断提高生产（添牲口、买农具、搞副业），建立民主制度，及时解决问题，把组织巩固起来，否则往往中途垮台。
    我建议土地改革之后应该号召组织起来（决不许强迫），解决困难，新型旧型都可以。这里实际上大量是旧形式，小部是新型的，这样就有逐步发展的可能。在郏县一类地区应以实例号召未互助者参加互助，已互助者逐步提高，并与供销社结合起来，目前大量的是发展新型农业互助，少数的是提倡与副业结合与技术结合。
    　　　　三、土地改革后农村的阶级斗争并未停止。
    在新的阶级关系下是新的斗争形态，农民是统治者，地主是被统治者。敌人活动基本上是采取两种形式：一种是一般的阶级斗争，用收买利诱，挑拨威胁等办法，钻入乡政权，拉拢乡干部，各个击破，逐步蚕食，隐蔽地或公开地篡夺领导，以达复辟和倒算的目的。其特点是地主不敢公开出头，而是从农民中找代理人，假农民之手，行地主之政；一种是反革命活动，主要是特务、会门与“地下军”等形式，平时隐蔽潜伏，企图乘隙举行暴乱。这两种是紧密联系着的。土地改革后大部乡村的农民阶级觉悟是高的，相当保持了警惕性与斗争性。在较好的乡村里，对地主有强迫劳动制度，对反动的有管制办法，对违法的能及时揭发斗争。但农民是有弱点的，如封建宗派、迷信、文化低、有些人作风不好等，都是地主可以利用的空隙。
    近半年来敌人活动是加紧了，朝鲜战争开始和美帝国主义在仁川登陆时，敌人曾两度散布谣言进行反攻。地主在头、二等乡表现为不听招呼，个别的进行收买、倒算、趾高气扬；在三等乡则篡夺领导，公开倒算。农民在头、二等乡一面怪上级不撑腰，怪无人领导，一面还有斗争，有还击；在三等乡，因坏分子当道，群众不敢说话。所以形成这样情况的原因是：（１）干部忙于整风，群众忙于生产，虽曾开展两次宣传攻势，但对地主的管制和斗争是放松了；（２）过分宽大，坏人以为不能怎样他，趾高气扬；（３）土地改革后农会组织涣散，群众失去阶级组织的依靠；（４）干部整风后，划不清对人民民主与对敌人专政的界限，束手束脚；（５）时局的直接影响。但自从去年十二月以来，由于逮捕了一大批反革命分子及恶霸，由于发土地证时首先开展了反霸、反倒算、反复辟的群众斗争，情况为之一变，农民情绪大大高涨，地主又低头老实下来。
    因此土地改革后必须加强专政，贯彻对敌人的斗争。一方面从组织上从思想上纯洁与巩固农民的队伍，提高战斗力；另一方面针锋相对地与敌人开展两个战线上的斗争。一个战线是开展对地主阶级的阶级斗争，根据不同地主，不同对待。从这些乡的地主情况来看，有四种：一是有反革命活动者（个别的），则应坚决镇压；二是行动不老实者（少数），则应坚决管制；三是行动守法、思想不服者（多数），则应劳动改造；四是要劳动、要投降，要向农民靠拢者（个别的），则可宽大待遇；另一个战线是镇压反革命斗争，平时注意侦察瓦解，情况紧张时（如春荒、时局波动等），主动破案逮捕。
    　　　　四、土改后的组织建设（也就是民主问题），也是一个重要问题。
    李口支部，已经开始解决了“三面受气”的问题，学会了分工领导。张店、老鸦陈、大张次之，能工作，但较混乱。俎庄最差，乡干部中核心不强，组织涣散，故一有工作，全村乱动。下面谈谈几个主要问题：
    党的建设，在李口已经开始解决了一个领导问题，即“分工负责”与“会啥领导啥”，部门有分工，上下有分工，群众有事，先从小组解决；有什么特长的党员，就发挥其特长，领导有关工作，这样便解决少数人忙多数人闲的问题，大家办工作，干部就可以“工作生产两不误”。因此干部高兴，群众高兴。其他乡尚未解决这个问题，但支部都能成为乡的领导核心。除解决领导办法外，还要解决提高思想与整顿组织问题。因为土地改革后党员不知道要干什么，看不到远大前途，好像土地改革完了，革命也完了一样。个别党员（如李口有二个）要求退党。但也有个别尚未入党而条件相当成熟的优秀分子应该吸收入党。
    各该乡都有团的支部，均甚活跃。李口的团着重掌握民兵，进行宣传与学习，有的乡团与党分不开。
    农民协会与人民代表会问题，是一个尚未解决的问题。农民协会已松懈涣散下来，乡人民代表会虽有，但民主内容十分不够，主要成了执行行政任务的组织。因此，土地改革后农民协会必须巩固下来，成为农民进行阶级斗争，开展批评与自我批评，实现民主生活的主要组织。凡重大问题先在农民协会商量，然后在乡人民代表会讨论通过。人民代表会一面是乡级权力机关（比农民协会包括的代表性更宽些），一面是执行机关。在乡人民代表会下按地区划分代表组；开会时不必强求公民都到，只要办事灵活简便，每家一人即可。凡遇派差、出粮等事宜，代表组可代管本村附近的地主。将来到一定时期之后，民主有了习惯，合作社、互助组都搞起了，人民代表会就可以逐渐代替农民协会的作用。
    李口民兵是很好的，除管制地主维持革命秩序外，已注意了积极生产与加紧学习（每晚上课）。但每人每月误工约五昼十夜。互助组对民兵组员有意见。应逐步扩大民兵组织，减少不必要的勤务，尽量减少误工。
    这几个乡的妇女工作是有问题的。土地改革中妇女的发动是不错的，生产中参加农业劳动是积极的，但目前被封建习惯所压抑，有转趋消沉之势。丈夫限制老婆开会，母亲不让女儿上学，妇女很难开成会，冬学也不易吸收青年妇女入学，主要是怕离婚，怕“管不住了”。这一问题应坚决地有步骤地加以解决，必须划清界限，深入教育。首先在生产运动中着重地集中地解决一下民主的（批评与自我批评）和睦的（团结是目的）家庭问题，反对虐待，解除妇女的封建束缚，有步骤地实行婚姻法。在这个问题上，抱着封建思想、放任不管与包办代替、急躁强迫的态度都是错误的。
    再一个是文化问题。乡村干部缺文化，农民缺文化，已经成为思想建设、推进工作的大障碍。乡文书政治进步的往往闹独立性，不听乡主席招呼；政治落后的往往成为地主“里打一股”的对象。因此乡村干部普遍要求学文化。李口现在的办法是乡村干部与小学校长互助，共同建立一个学习组，乡村干部学文化，校长学工作，小学兼办乡的夜校（识字班），校长兼民兵文化教员，这一办法是好的。乡村干部与小学相结合的办法，既可改造小学，又可提高乡村干部的文化。
    　　　　五、土地改革后农村有三项主要工作。
    从以上材料看来，从土地改革转入生产是一个大的转变，领导与群众都存在着很大的盲目性。虽然一年生产的成果是不错的，领导上所抓的几个主要工作也是对头的，如宣传政策，提出方向（增产一成），抓紧生产关节，解决群众生产中的困难，号召劳动互助等都是很好的。但是由于在摸索中前进，因而走了不少弯路。如开始发生了“松一口气”的思想，以为生产不用领导；继而强编互助，想找到如土地改革一样的所谓生产路线；再则找到了一般方向，但放松了深入重点，丢开了“组织起来”的口号。抓紧生产时放松了阶级斗争，抓紧了阶级斗争时（如目前镇压反革命与发土地证）又放松了生产（冬春生产未作打算）。总之，领导方面是走一步摸一步，拿起一个又丢下一个。群众生产情绪是很高的，但也总以为生产还不是那么老一套，不懂得土地改革后的新的生产方向。因此，从土地改革转向生产需要明确地提出一系列的问题来。我考虑土地改革后农村主要是三项工作：巩固人民民主专政（民主要建设，专政要巩固），经济建设，文化建设（同时也是思想建设）。三项工作互相结合，以经济建设为中心，就是说建设新的农村。
