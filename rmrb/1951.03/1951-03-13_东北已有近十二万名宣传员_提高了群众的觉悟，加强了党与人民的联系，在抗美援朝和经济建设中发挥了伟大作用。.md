　　[Reported by this newspaper] The organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in Northeast China have established nearly 120,000 propagandists. These propagandists regularly conduct propaganda among the masses on current events, policies, and production, thereby raising the political awareness of the masses. They have played a great role in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, national defense construction, and economic construction, making the relationship between the Party and the people even closer, and creating many valuable experiences for the Party's propaganda work. This is worthy of serious study by other regions.
    The work of establishing a propaganda network in the Northeast region began last spring. From late February to mid-March, the working group of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee first conducted a key experiment in establishing propagandists at the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory in Shenyang. The Zhaodong County Committee of the CPC Heilongjiang Province and the Anshan and Fushun Municipal Committees also successively began key experiments in March and April. After the Northeast Industrial and Mining Enterprise Propaganda Work Conference in May, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and Dalian Benxi and other places successively began to establish propagandist work with emphasis. After October, the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was universally launched, and most regions and factories and mines experimented with setting up propagandists, and some regions and factories and mines organized propaganda networks in this movement. According to statistics at the end of 1950, the total number of propagandists in the region reached 117,283. The distribution of propagandists in some areas and factories and mines with a better foundation is quite extensive. For example, propagandists at the Dalian Far East Electric Glass Factory account for 10% of the total number of employees, propagandists at the Anshan Ore Dressing Plant account for 6% of the total number of employees, and the branch with the most propagandists at the Shenyang Nail Factory accounts for 13% of the total number of employees. Three-quarters of the rural areas in Heilongjiang Province have established propaganda networks, with more than 40,000 propagandists. Most of these propagandists are Communist Party members and members of the New Democratic Youth League, and the rest are labor models and revolutionary activists who voluntarily work under the leadership of the Communist Party from among the masses around the Party branch. For example, among the 98 propagandists in the Anshan Ore Dressing Plant, there are 12 factory-level cadres such as the secretary of the CPC general branch committee and the director and deputy director of the plant. Among the total of 98 people, there are 53 Communist Party members, 23 Youth League members, and 22 mass activists. They play a leading role in production, and one-third of them have been selected as labor models and work models. Another example is that among the 72 propagandists in Nangang Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, there are 25 Party members, 32 League members, 11 provincial, county, and district people's representatives, and 4 production team leaders. They live among the masses and work with the masses, are familiar with the thoughts and feelings of the masses, understand the various problems in production, and are good at using things that the masses feel or have experienced to carry out political and production propaganda in a form that the masses like to hear and see. This has freed the masses from the confusion of rumors, improved their understanding of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and transformed the Party's ideas and policies into the actual actions of the broad masses. Therefore, since the establishment of the propaganda network, all tasks, whether in urban or rural areas, have been completed better and faster than before.
    In the process of establishing the propaganda network, the Party has made great efforts to overcome all kinds of ideological obstacles. In the beginning, some people held an extremely rude and contemptuous attitude towards the Party's mass propaganda work. They doubted what role the establishment of a propaganda network would play. They either said, "Coal is dug out shovel by shovel, not propagandized," or "We are too busy with work to take care of propaganda." These people obviously thought that only by relying on administrative orders could work tasks be completed. The Party patiently persuaded them on the one hand, and resolutely carried out the work according to the original plan. After the propagandist work was launched and had a great effect, this part of the comrades finally had to correct their wrong understanding. People who originally thought that "coal is not propagandized" watched as the mine exceeded the production task by an average of 50% per month after the propagandist work was launched, and could not help but exclaim in surprise: "Coal is really propagandized!" People who originally thought that work that could not be promoted even by orders "what role can propaganda play" later saw that even work combined with propaganda really motivated the masses, and said: "This is really a good method. It does not delay work, nor does it involve coercion, and the masses are very enthusiastic. If I had known this method earlier, why bother with coercive orders?" Many cadres realized that "if the masses' thinking is clear, everything is easy to handle, and tasks can be completed without coercive orders." In the report of the Fuxian County Party Committee to the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee, it was said: "The experience of this period tells us that the working method of combining in-depth current affairs propaganda and mobilization with the full exertion of organizational strength, that is, the mass line working method, is the best method to overcome commandism and complete arduous work tasks." The report of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee said: "Many cadres say that they must study propaganda work well in the future. Some cadres have regarded whether they attach importance to propaganda work as a concrete manifestation of whether they have a mass viewpoint, and some leading cadres have regarded propaganda work as a basic method for them to realize ideological leadership."
    The establishment of the propaganda network has greatly strengthened the mass nature and organizational nature of the Party's propaganda work, and has begun to maintain regularity and persistence. Although some of the existing propagandists inevitably cannot play a role or cannot play a role regularly, this is mainly because some Party committees still do not pay enough attention to propaganda work and lack experience, and have not established a systematic leadership system to train and educate propagandists and plan, check and guide their work; but most propagandists can play a role regularly. In the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in places where the work was good, 50% to 60% of the residents were exposed to the propaganda of the propagandists. The Party in Liaodong Province once solved many doubts among the people through propagandists and established several basic concepts of anti-Americanism and patriotism. The masses who listened to the propaganda said: "What the Communist Party says is all true." In industrial and mining production, the role of propagandists is even greater. The propagandists of the Hegang Coal Mine promoted the benefits of the new coal mining method and the harm of the old coal mining method, and the workers quickly abandoned their past prejudices and accepted the new working methods, and said: "The country is thinking of us." In rural areas, when work tasks come, the Party and government organizations now understand how to use the power of propagandists to mobilize. A propagandist in Shangjiatai Village, Yingkou County, composed a clapper talk when promoting the payment of public grain: "Why pay public grain? Support the front line and build factories. The front line eats enough to fight a victorious battle, the workers eat enough and the machines sound, making agricultural tools for good production, making guns and cannons to send to the front, the country is rich and the people are strong, and American aggression will be wiped out." This kind of vivid and timely propaganda encouraged the patriotic enthusiasm of the farmers and enabled the village to complete the public grain smoothly. After the CPC Central Committee issued its decision on establishing a propaganda network for the people in the whole party, the Northeast Bureau held a Northeast Region Propaganda Representative Conference from January 8th to 12th of this year to exchange the work experience of propagandists in various places. The Northeast Bureau also decided to continue to develop propagandists, seek consolidation in development, and then develop again in consolidation, and earnestly implement the various systems and methods stipulated in the Central Committee's decision, and overcome the phenomenon of a laissez-faire attitude towards the leadership of propagandists in some places. It is expected that the Party's propaganda network in the Northeast region will be further improved in the future.
    The Northeast Region has the following main experiences in establishing a propaganda network:
    First, the attention of Party committees at all levels and systematic leadership are the basic key to establishing and consolidating the propaganda network. Wherever the Party committee attaches importance and conducts systematic leadership, the propaganda network work has achieved remarkable results. The Party committees in these places have earnestly done the following things: ① Formulate a more practical plan for establishing a propaganda network according to the specific local conditions; ② Call on the whole Party to attach importance to the work of establishing a propaganda network, with responsibilities at all levels, everyone working together, earnestly conducting key experiments, and promptly correcting various wrong understandings and deviations; ③ Earnestly train and select propagandists, pay attention to the political quality of propagandists, and earnestly implement the appointment procedures for propagandists; ④ Strengthen the leadership of propagandist work, establish and adhere to various leadership systems; ⑤ Conduct timely inspection and summary, and promote experience. In this way, the work of establishing a propaganda network can move forward steadily and develop gradually on a more solid foundation. However, some places have also produced deviations in emphasizing quantity over quality and a laissez-faire attitude due to insufficient understanding of the establishment of a propaganda network. This makes the number of propagandists large but the role is small, and at the same time, it is easy to give bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of. On the other hand, some places mystify the propaganda network, demand too much, and are tied up, making the propaganda network unable to be established for a long time. For example, a factory in Shenyang has 386 employees, 30 Party members, and 80 League members, but there are only 5 propagandists (4 Party members and 1 League member), so that it cannot play the due propaganda power among the masses.
    Second, the work of establishing a propaganda network must be combined with production, local specific tasks, and mass political movements in various periods. Because the activists who emerge in actual movements are generally very good objects for developing propagandists, and cultivating and improving them can play a very good role.
    Third, the law of establishing and consolidating the propaganda network is from point to surface, combining points and surfaces, seeking consolidation in development, and then developing again in consolidation, constantly improving and constantly moving forward. In the past year, many regions have applied this law very well. For example, some provinces and cities have started with the propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal Party committees, the prefectural Party committees, and the county Party committees (including the general branch of the enterprise Party committee) to conduct key experiments in establishing a propaganda network, and quickly promote the experience of each key point to the surface. In the work of consolidation and improvement, we should also first obtain the experience of consolidation and improvement, and then promote it to the surface. Only by continuously obtaining the experience of points and continuously promoting the experience of points to the surface can we gradually improve and constantly move forward. However, some places in the past have not paid enough attention to the methods of combining points and surfaces and the relationship between development and consolidation. Either they promoted it in an all-round way without conducting key experiments; or they conducted key experiments in isolation without earnestly summarizing and promoting experience; or they only conducted key experiments in provinces and cities without promoting the simultaneous conduct of Party leadership organs at all levels; or they only focused on development and ignored consolidation, so that the established propagandist organizations had a "fallow" phenomenon; or they divided development and consolidation into two completely different stages; all of these are wrong.

　　东北已有近十二万名宣传员
    提高了群众的觉悟，加强了党与人民的联系，在抗美援朝和经济建设中发挥了伟大作用。
    【本报讯】东北地区的中国共产党的组织已经设立了将近十二万名宣传员。宣传员们经常地向人民群众进行时事、政策和生产的宣传，提高了群众的政治觉悟，在抗美援朝，国防建设和经济建设中发挥了伟大作用，使党与人民的关系更加密切，并为党的宣传工作创造了许多宝贵的经验。这是值得其他地区认真学习的。
    东北区建立宣传网的工作开始于去年春季。二月下旬至三月中旬，中共中央东北局宣传部的工作小组首先在沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂进行建立宣传员的重点试验。中共黑龙江省肇东县县委和鞍山、抚顺两市市委亦先后在三月和四月开始重点试验。五月东北工矿企业宣传工作会议以后，沈阳机器一厂和大连本溪等地相继开始有重点地建立宣传员工作。十月以后，抗美援朝运动普遍展开，大部分地区和厂矿便都试验着设立宣传员，而且有部分地区和厂矿就在这一运动中把宣传网组织起来了。据一九五零年年底统计，全区宣传员已达十一万七千二百八十三人。部分基础较好的地区和厂矿宣传员的分布已相当广泛。如大连远东电业玻璃工厂宣传员占职工总数百分之十，鞍山选矿厂宣传员占职工总数百分之六，沈阳市制钉厂宣传员最多的支部达职工总数百分之十三。黑龙江全省四分之三的农村建立了宣传网，有宣传员四万人以上。这些宣传员大部分是共产党员和新民主主义青年团员，其余也都是党支部周围群众中自愿在共产党领导下担任宣传工作的劳动模范和革命积极分子。如鞍山市选矿厂的九十八个宣传员中，有中共总支委书记、正副厂长等厂级干部十二人。在总数九十八人中有共产党员五十三人，青年团员二十三人，群众积极分子二十二人，他们在生产中起着带头作用，曾有三分之一被选为劳动模范和工作模范。又如吉林省蛟河县南岗村宣传员七十二人，有党员二十五人，团员三十二人。省县区人民代表十一人，生产组长四人。他们生活在群众中并与群众共同劳动，既熟悉群众的思想情感，又懂得生产中的种种问题，善于利用群众所感受到的或经历过的事情，以群众喜闻乐见的形式，进行政治和生产的宣传，使群众脱离了谣言的困扰，提高了抗美援朝的认识，把党的思想政策变成广大群众的实际行动。所以，自从建立了宣传网以后，无论城市或农村，一切工作任务都比从前完成得更好更快了。
    在建立宣传网的过程中，党曾经以很大的努力来克服形形色色的思想上的障碍。在开始的时候，有些人对于党的群众宣传工作抱着极其粗暴的轻视态度。他们怀疑建立宣传网会有什么作用。他们或者说：“煤是一锹一锹挖出来的，不是宣传出来的。”或者说：“工作太忙，顾不上宣传。”这些人显然以为只有依靠行政命令，才能完成工作任务。党一方面耐心地说服他们，同时坚决地按照原定计划展开工作。在宣传员工作展开起来并且发生了极大效果以后，终于使这一部分同志不能不纠正自己的错误的认识。原来认为“煤不是宣传出来”的人，眼看着在宣传员工作展开以后矿坑里每月平均超过生产任务百分之五十，不能不惊喜地喊道：“真把煤宣传出来了！”原来认为用命令都推不动的工作“宣传能起什么作用”的人，后来看到连干带宣传真把群众带动起来了，就说：“这真是好法子。又不误工，又不犯强迫，群众干得还很起劲。早知道这个办法，何必犯强迫命令呢？”许多干部认识到“群众思想通了，啥事都好办，不强迫命令也能完成任务”。在复县县委给辽东省委的报告中说：“这一时期的工作经验告诉我们：深入的时事宣传与动员和充分发挥组织力量相结合的工作方法，即是群众路线的工作方法，是克服命令主义、完成繁重工作任务的最好的方法。”辽东省委的报告中说：“许多干部都说，以后非好好学习做宣传工作不可。有些干部已把是否重视宣传工作，看成了是否有群众观点的具体表现，有些领导干部已把宣传工作看成是自己实现思想领导的基本方法。”
    宣传网的建立，使党的宣传工作的群众性和组织性大大地加强，并开始保持经常性和持久性。已有的宣传员虽然难免有一部分不能起作用或不能经常起作用，这主要是由于一部分党委对宣传工作仍然重视不够并缺乏经验，没有建立起有系统的领导制度，来培养和教育宣传员，并计划、检查和指导他们的工作；但大部分宣传员是能经常起作用的。在抗美援朝运动中，工作好的地方，百分之五十至六十的居民，都受到了宣传员的宣传。辽东省的党曾经经过宣传员解决了人民群众中的许多疑虑，树立了几个反美爱国的基本概念。听了宣传的群众说：“共产党说的都是真心话。”在工矿生产中，宣传员的作用更大。鹤岗煤矿的宣传员，宣传了新式采煤法的好处和旧式采煤法的害人，工人们就迅速地抛弃过去的偏见，接受新的工作方法，并且说：“国家都是为咱们着想。”在农村中，当工作任务来了的时候，现在党和政府的组织已经懂得运用宣传员的力量进行动员。营口县商家台村的一个宣传员在宣传纳公粮时，编了一个快板说：“为什么，纳公粮？支援前线建工厂。前线吃饱打胜仗，工人吃饱机器响，造出农具好生产，造出枪炮送前方，国也富来民也强，美国侵略一扫光。”这样生动及时的宣传，就鼓舞了农民的爱国热忱，使该村公粮顺利完成。在中共中央发表关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网决定以后，东北局曾于本年一月八日至十二日举行了东北区宣传员代表会议，交流了各地宣传员的工作经验。东北局并且决定了继续发展宣传员，在发展中求巩固，在巩固中再发展的方针，并切实执行中央决定中所规定的各种制度和办法，克服目前某些地方存在着的对宣传员的领导采取放任自流态度的现象，预计今后东北区的党的宣传网将会更进一步地健全起来。
    东北区在建立宣传网的工作中有如下几点主要经验：
    第一、各级党委的重视和有系统的领导，是建立和巩固宣传网的基本关键。凡是党委重视并有系统地进行领导的地方，宣传网工作就获得了显著的成绩。这些地方的党委认真地作了这样几件事情：①根据当地具体情况制订建立宣传网的比较实际的计划；②号召全党重视建立宣传网工作，各级负责，大家动手，认真进行重点试验，及时纠正各种错误认识和偏差；③认真培养和选拔宣传员，注意宣传员的政治质量，切实执行宣传员的任命手续等；④加强对宣传员工作的领导，建立并坚持各种领导制度；⑤及时进行检查总结，推广经验。这样，建立宣传网的工作便能稳步前进，在比较巩固的基础上逐步地发展起来。但也有些地方由于对建立宣传网的认识不够，产生了重量不重质的偏向，和放任自流的态度。这就使宣传员数量虽多而作用不大，同时容易予不良分子以可乘之机。另一方面，也有一些地方把宣传网神秘化，要求过高，束手束脚，使宣传网迟迟建立不起来。如沈阳某厂有职工三百八十六人，党员三十人，团员八十人，但宣传员只有五人（四个党员，一个团员），以致在群众中不能发挥应有的宣传力量。
    第二、建立宣传网工作必须与生产、与当地具体任务及各个时期的群众政治运动结合进行。因为在实际运动中所涌现的积极分子，一般都是发展宣传员的很好的对象，把他们加以培养和提高，可以起很好作用。
    第三，建立和巩固宣传网的规律是由点到面，点面结合，在发展中求巩固，在巩固中再发展，不断提高，不断前进。在过去一年中，有不少地区把这个规律运用得很好。如有的省市从省市委、地委到县委（包括企业党委总支）的宣传部大家动手，认真地进行了建立宣传网的重点试验，并把各个重点的经验迅速推广到面。在巩固和提高的工作中，也应当是先取得巩固和提高的经验，再推广到面。如此不断地取得点的经验，不断地把点的经验推广到面，才能逐步提高，不断前进。但过去有些地方对点面结合的方法和发展及巩固的关系注意不够。或者没有进行重点试验就全面推广；或者孤立地进行重点试验，而没有认真总结和推广经验；或者只在省市进行重点试验，而没有推动党的各级领导机关同时进行；或者只顾发展，忽视巩固，使已建立的宣传员组织发生了“撩荒”现象；或者把发展和巩固分作截然不同的两个阶段；这些都是不对的。
