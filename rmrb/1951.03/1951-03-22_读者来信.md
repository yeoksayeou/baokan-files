Reader's Letters

\tArticles Should Be Shorter and More Popular
\tTo the Editors:
\tPeople's Daily articles are our daily spiritual food. However, when I and many other comrades talk about it, we all feel that many articles in the newspaper are too long and the language is not popular enough, making them difficult to read, but we cannot bear not to read the People's Daily articles. I think the solution is to rely on you to encourage the authors to write shorter and more popular articles. This will not only benefit readers but also enhance the effectiveness of propaganda and education. Please consider this. Regards!
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReader Huang Dingwen

\tEditor's Note: Comrade Huang Dingwen's opinion is very valuable. During this period, our newspaper has published more lengthy essays. It should be said that most of these essays have content. Publishing these essays is correct and beneficial; however, it cannot be denied that the language of some essays, communications, and news reports is quite lengthy, containing more or less waste in terms of their content. In our editorial work, we have not made efforts in the past to make published articles concise, popular, and lively, which has caused inconvenience to readers and weakened the role of propaganda and education. This is something we should strive to improve in the future. We plan to make some improvements starting with the second and third editions. In the future, these two editions will certainly continue to publish valuable, longer essays and communications, but we will pay more attention to frequently publishing short articles with substantial content. In the third edition, in addition to one or at most two longer articles, we will try to publish short essays and communications on various topics every day. The "Party Life" column will also strive to publish concise and incisive commentaries. In addition, we will try to publish illustrations in a fixed position on the third edition every day. This is our hope. Whether we can do it well depends on the enthusiastic assistance of the vast number of authors and readers.

\tTongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters
\tSubmits Opinions on the Provisional Method of Rationing
\tTo the Editors:
\tAfter the National Cooperative Headquarters promulgated the Provisional Method of Rationing, Tongxian Special District, in implementing the rationing and carrying out evaluation work, made us further realize that the implementation of the rationing method can indeed promote the regularization of the business and organization of cooperatives; especially the grassroots cooperative cadres conducted serious evaluation work in order to strive for rationing rights, which played a great role in improving the cooperatives a step further. However, in the process of implementing the rationing work, we have the following opinions on the Provisional Method of Rationing stipulated by the National Cooperative Headquarters, and we hereby submit them to you in order to arouse everyone's discussion.

\t(1) We believe that the Provisional Method of Rationing only applies to urban consumer cooperatives, but does not fully apply to rural supply and marketing cooperatives. Because the former only supplies but does not sell, while the latter supplies and sells, the nature and tasks of the two are different, so it is necessary to have separate provisions for the rationing methods in rural and urban areas. The main task of rural supply and marketing cooperatives is to serve production through supply and marketing business; that is, only when the members do a good job in production and improve their purchasing power can they expand their consumer business. Especially in cooperatives in mountainous, water towns, and disaster-stricken areas like Tongxian Special District, they should first promote the sales of farmers' local products and solve their needs for means of production; otherwise, the consumer business is difficult to develop. For example, Yin Puchun, a representative of the Wangjiayu cooperative members in Huairou County, said: "If the cooperative can help us sell mountain goods, people in the mountains can have white flour to eat." The director of the Huludai Village Cooperative in Liangxiang said: "If the cooperative can buy pyrethrum to kill the pear orchard insects, it can increase the production of 400,000 catties of pears, and we won't have to worry about buying anything else." Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative Headquarters added a clause to the four evaluation conditions of the National Cooperative Headquarters, "Rural supply and marketing cooperatives should actively promote the surplus products of members," and we added a sentence based on our own experience, "and actively supply members with means of production" as a condition.

\t(2) The cultural level of rural cadres is generally low, so we believe that in the evaluation conditions, as long as the accounts are verifiable, there is no corruption, accounts are settled on time and announced to the members, and correct figures that can be provided to the superior cooperative for statistical materials are considered sufficient. It is not necessary to pursue whether their accounting forms or reporting formats are scientific; otherwise, it will be difficult for rural cooperatives to find cooperatives that are qualified to enjoy rationing. (The issue of whether the accounting conditions of rural cooperatives should be lowered is worth studying – Editor)

\t(3) The types, quantities, and seasonality of rationed goods should also be different between urban and rural areas. For example, urban members want to eat white sugar, while rural members are accustomed to using brown sugar (especially pregnant women). Members in mountainous areas generally wear homespun cloth, while people in plain areas need to wear foreign cloth, so we believe that the superior cooperative should mix homespun cloth and foreign cloth for rationing. Urban members often eat soy sauce, so they eat less salt; while rural areas (especially farmers in mountainous or disaster-stricken areas have to eat some wild vegetables and leaves, which requires a lot of salt), they need more salt, but only one catty of salt is rationed to them per season, which seems a little too little.

\t(4) Article 3 of the first quarter's rationing method stipulates that "the prices of rationed commodities in grassroots cooperatives should be uniformly regulated in the same region (city or county),...". We believe that such a rigid regulation is also inappropriate, because the freight and damage rate of village cooperatives far from the county cooperative are high, so the price should be higher. If it is closer to the county cooperative and it is convenient to pick up the goods, the price can be lower. As long as the profits turned over are unified, this regional price difference should be appropriately maintained. Secondly, regarding the item "The prices of rationed commodities in grassroots cooperatives shall be formulated by the county (city) headquarters and submitted to the provincial headquarters for approval and implementation,...", this is easy to do in places with convenient urban transportation, but it is more difficult in rural areas. For example, if it is reported to the provincial headquarters for approval and then notified to the grassroots cooperative, it will take more than half a month to go back and forth for remote villages. If the price of goods changes slightly, the difficulty will be even greater. Therefore, we believe that the rationing price can be determined by the county cooperative itself without going through the procedure of reporting back and forth.

\t(5) The issue of halving the rationing for child members has aroused many opinions among farmers. Child members do not pay less shares, and do not save more kerosene for clothing, because children have to wear new clothes during the New Year and festivals, and they have to light lamps to study at night. We also hope that the superior cooperative will consider this.

\t(6) We hope to guarantee the quantitative rationing. In the first quarter, Tianjin Petroleum Company rationed one catty of kerosene per person per season, but due to damage during transportation, it is often impossible to guarantee the full amount to the members, so we hope that the company will allocate more damage volume when allocating goods in the future to avoid losses to the members.
\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeputy Director of Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Zhu Zheng

\tEditor's Note: The Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative put forward supplementary opinions on the Provisional Method of Rationing of the Cooperative Headquarters based on the specific circumstances of rural areas. It is hoped that cooperatives at all levels in various places will pay attention to this and launch discussions.

\tShanghai Cooperative Union Did Not Complete the Rationing Task in February
\tTo the Editors:
\tThe total value of the key rationed goods of the Shanghai Cooperative Union in February of the first quarter was more than 887 million yuan, saving about 150 million yuan in intermediate exploitation for the members who enjoyed the rationing, which is good. However, the sales volume of rationed goods this time is generally less than the originally planned rationing volume. For example, the sales volume of briquettes was only 61.5% of the original rationing volume, Northeast soybean oil was 39%, Huai salt was 38%, and flour was only 6.9%. The average sales volume of each item accounted for only a little over 40% of the original rationing volume.

\tWhy was the rationing work not completed? The main reasons are as follows:

\tFirst, before the implementation of the rationing work, the significance of rationed goods was not well publicized, so many members failed to enjoy the right to rationing.

\tSecond, the Municipal Federation did not conduct a survey beforehand and did not understand the needs of the members, so it blindly ordered the quantity of rationed goods. For example, the members did not need flour very much, so the sales volume only accounted for 6.9% of the original sales volume.

\tThird, some of the rationed materials were small in quantity and inconvenient to carry. For example, only one and a half catties of soybean oil were rationed per person, so everyone was unwilling to buy it.

\tIt is hoped that the relevant parties will study the above shortcomings and strive to complete the rationing work 100% next time.

专栏：读者来信

　　读者来信
    文章要写短些通俗些编辑同志：
    人民日报的文章是我们每日的精神食粮。但是，我和其他许多同志谈起，都觉得报纸上的许多文章篇幅太长，文字不通俗，看起来很吃力，而人民日报的文章我们又舍不得不看。我想解决的办法，只有依靠你们努力使作者们把文章写得短些，写得通俗些。这样不但便利读者，而且可以增强宣传教育的实效。请你们考虑。敬礼！
                                        读者  黄鼎文
    编者按：读者黄鼎文同志的意见很宝贵。这一个时期我们报纸所刊载的长篇论文比较多。应当说，这些论文大部分是有内容的。发表这些论文是正确的，有益的；但是，不能否认，有些论文、通讯以及新闻的文字相当冗长，按照它们的内容来说，包含着或多或少的浪费。我们在编辑工作中，过去没有努力使发表的文章做到简要、通俗、活泼，以致读者感到不便，减弱了宣传教育的作用。这是今后应该努力改进的。我们打算先从第二版和第三版进行一些改进。今后，在这两版中，当然要继续刊载有价值的篇幅较长的论文和通讯，但是我们将更多注意于经常发表内容充实的短篇文字。在第三版，除了一篇或至多两篇较长的文字外，我们将尽可能每天登载各种题目的短篇论文、通讯，“党的生活”栏也将力求多登短小精悍的评论。此外，我们将尽量每天在第三版的一定地位刊载图画。这是我们的希望，能否做好，还要依赖广大的作者和读者给予我们以热情的援助。
    通县专区供销总社
    对配售暂行办法提出意见编辑同志：
    全国合作总社颁布配售暂行办法后，通县专区在贯彻配售和开展评比工作中，使我们进一步体会到实行配售办法，的确能促使合作社的业务和组织走向正轨化；特别是基层社干部为了争取配售权利，进行了认真的评比工作，这对把合作社提高一步起了很大的作用。但在执行配售工作的过程中，我们对全国总社规定的配售暂行办法，有以下意见，特向你们提出来，以便引起大家的讨论。
    （一）我们认为配售暂行办法只适用于城市消费合作社，而对农村供销合作社则不完全适用。因为前者只供不销，后者又供又销，两者性质任务不同，所以农村和城市的配售办法有分别规定的必要。农村供销社的主要任务是通过供销业务而服务生产；也就是只有社员搞好生产，提高购买力后，才能扩大消费业务。特别像通县专区一带的山地、水乡及灾情严重地区的合作社，首先应该推销农民的土产和解决他们需要的生产资料；否则，消费业务是很难开展的。如怀柔县王家峪社员代表尹甫春说：“合作社能帮我们推销山货，山里的人就能有白面吃。”良乡葫芦岱村社主任说：“合作社要买到除虫菊杀死梨林虫，可增产四十万斤梨，再买什么也不发愁啦。”所以这次河北省合作总社曾对全国总社的四个评比条件加上一条“农村供销社要积极推销社员剩余产品”，我们又根据本身的经验加了一句，“并积极供给社员生产资料”为条件。
    （二）农村干部的文化水平一般都较低，因此我们认为在评比条件时，只要账目可查，不贪污，按期结账并向社员公布和能供给上级社作统计材料的正确数字时就算够条件。而不必追求他们记账的形式或表报格式是否科学，否则，农村合作社就很难找到够条件享受配售的合作社了。（农村合作社是否应该降低记账条件的问题值得研究——编者）
    （三）在配售货物的种类、定量和季节性上，城市与农村也应该有所不同。如城市社员要吃白糖，而农村则惯用红糖（尤其是产妇）。山区社员一般的习惯穿土布，平原地区的人则需要穿洋布，所以我们认为上级社应将土布和洋布掺合配售。城市社员常吃酱油，这样吃的盐就较少；而农村（特别是山区或灾区的农民要吃一部分野菜、树叶，这特别费盐），盐就需要得多些，但配售给他们的每季只一斤盐，这似乎太少一点。
    （四）第一季配售办法第三条规定“基层合作社的配售商品价格，在同一地区（市或县）应有统一规定，……”。我们认为这样硬性规定也是不妥当的，因为距县社远的村社，货物的运费和伤耗率要大，所以价格就应该高些，离县社较近，取货方便，价格就可以低些。只要上解的利润能统一，这种地区间的差价是应该适当保持的。其次，关于“基层合作社的配售商品价格，由县（市）总社拟定，报请省总社批准执行，……”一项，这在城市交通方便的地方，很容易办到，但在农村就比较困难，如报请省社批准，再通知基层社，对偏僻的村庄来说，往返需时半个月以上，如货价稍有变化，则困难更大。所以我们认为，配售价格可由县社自行确定，不必经过往返请示的手续。
    （五）儿童社员减半配售的问题，在农民中引起了很多意见。儿童社员的股金并不少缴，穿衣用煤油并不比大人省，因为过年过节儿童要穿新衣，晚间要点灯念书。这一点也希望上级社予以考虑。
    （六）希望能保证定量配售。在第一季度天津石油公司按每季每人配给煤油一斤，但因途中损耗，往往不能保证足量配给社员，所以我们希望以后公司拨货时应加拨伤耗量，以免社员吃亏。
             通县专区供销总社副主任  朱正
    编者按：通县专区供销总社根据农村具体情况，对合作总社配售暂行办法提出了补充意见。希望各地各级合作社能加以注意，并展开讨论。
    上海市合作社联合社二月份未完成配售任务编辑同志：
    上海市合作社联合社举办的第一季度二月份重点配售全部货物总值八亿八千七百多万元，为享受配售的社员省去中间剥削约一亿五千万元，这是好的。但这次配售货物的销出数量，一般都比原定配售量要少，如煤球配出量仅为原定配量的百分之六一·五，东北豆油为百分之三九，淮盐为百分之三八，面粉仅百分之六·九。各货平均配出量仅占原定配量的百分之四十强。
    为什么未能完成配售工作呢？主要原因有下列几点：
    第一，在实行配售工作前，对配售货物的意义没有很好地进行宣传，所以许多社员未能享受配售的权利。
    第二，市联合社在事前未经过调查，不了解社员的需求情况，即盲目地预订了配售物的数量，如面粉，社员都不很需要，所以销出量仅占原定售出量的百分之六·九。
    第三，有部分配售物资数量既小，携带又不方便，如豆油每人只配给一斤半，所以大家也就不愿意买了。
    以上的缺点，希望有关方面予以研究，争取下次的配售工作能够百分之百的完成。			 巴祈
