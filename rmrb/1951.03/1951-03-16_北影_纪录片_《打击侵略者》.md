    "Strike the Aggressors"
    Edited by Qian Xiaozhang
    After World War II, American imperialism replaced fascist Germany and Japan, becoming the new base of imperialist aggression, dreaming of dominating the entire world. And China is the main target of American imperialist aggression in Asia. For more than a hundred years, American imperialism has been invading China. After Japan surrendered in 1945, this aggression developed into a new stage. American imperialism conspired with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to turn China into an American-dominated colony. Under this conspiracy, we will see a series of acts of aggression: a large number of American officers commanded Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops to fight against the Chinese people.

     Eight hundred thousand Chiang bandit troops were transported to the front lines of the civil war by American warships and planes. The United States also trained a large number of army, air force, police, and secret agents for Chiang Kai-shek, and established countless "Sino-American Cooperation Organizations" to cruelly slaughter patriotic people. American imperialism even sent its troops to China to interfere in China's internal affairs by force and fight alongside Chiang bandit troops against the Chinese people.
  
  However, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the millions of people in the liberated areas, thoroughly shattered the enemy's offensive on the battlefields of Northeast, North, East, and Northwest China, and victoriously turned to the counter-offensive, liberating major cities.

  The great victory of the Chinese people declared the bankruptcy of the US-Chiang conspiracy to the world. The American imperialist plan to invade the world suffered its first major blow and failure in the face of the Chinese people.

  The new China was born. The great leader Chairman Mao led us to this victory, and the protector of the Chinese people—the People's Liberation Army, Navy, and Air Force—has also grown stronger and stronger through the tempering of combat, guarding the peace of the East and the world.

  The victorious Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, are bravely and diligently engaged in arduous peaceful construction.

  However, American imperialism is not reconciled to its failure on the Chinese mainland. It is using all means to support the reactionary militarist forces of Japan, vainly attempting to use them to invade China again. The U.S. imperialists are following the old path of Japanese warlord aggression, first invading Korea and Taiwan, second invading the Northeast, and third invading all of China, and then all of Asia, and dominating the world.

  In June 1950, American imperialism implemented the first step of its aggression plan, throwing the heinous war of aggression onto the peaceful Korean people, and openly declared the occupation of our territory, Taiwan.

  This man-eating savage of American imperialism carried out devastating bombings and killings against the cities and villages of Korea, and against the children and mothers of Korea. Imperialist planes constantly crossed the Yalu River and invaded Chinese airspace, wantonly bombing and strafing the peaceful Chinese people.

  As a result, the people of all China, under unbearable circumstances, launched a vigorous patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. People from all over the country enthusiastically joined the volunteer army and set off for the Korean front. The Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side with the Korean People's Army and valiantly shattered the aggressors' dream of dominating the world once again.

  The myth of the invincibility of American imperialism has been completely shattered on the Korean battlefield. The peace-loving and righteous Chinese and Korean people are advancing bravely on the road to victory in striking against the American aggressors. The imperialists will forever get out of Asia.

    美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战后，代替了法西斯德国和日本，成为帝国主义新的侵略大本营，它梦想独霸全世界。而中国更是美国帝国主义在亚洲主要的侵略目标。一百多年来，美国帝国主义一直侵略着我们中国，一九四五年日本投降后，这种侵略发展到一个新的阶段。美帝国主义阴谋勾结卖国贼蒋介石，要把中国变成美国独霸的殖民地，于是在这个阴谋下面，我们将看到一连串的侵略事实，大批的美国军官指挥着蒋介石反动军队向中国人民作战。
     八十万蒋匪军，经过美国兵舰和飞机运到内战前线。美国又替蒋介石训练着大批的陆军、空军、警察和特务，设立无数的“中美合作所”残酷的屠杀爱国的人民。美帝国主义更派遣了他的军队来到中国，武装干涉中国的内政和蒋匪军并肩向中国人民作战。
  但是英勇的中国人民解放军，在千千万万解放区人民的支援下，在东北、华北、华东和西北各战场彻底的粉碎了敌人的进攻，并使自己胜利的转入反攻，解放了各大城市。
  中国人民的伟大胜利，向全世界宣告着美蒋阴谋的破产，美国帝国主义侵略世界的计划，在中国人民面前遭到了第一次最大的打击和失败。
  新中国诞生了，伟大的领袖毛主席领导着我们走向这个胜利，而中国人民的保护者——人民解放军陆海空军，也从战斗的锻炼中日益强大，她警卫着东方和世界的和平。
  胜利了的中国人民，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，勇敢勤劳的从事艰巨的和平建设。
  但是，美帝国主义对于自己在中国大陆上的失败是不甘心的，它又用一切方法来扶植日本反动的军国主义势力，妄想利用它重来侵略中国。美帝走着日本军阀侵略的老路，第一步侵略朝鲜和台湾，第二步侵略东北，第三步侵略全中国，进而全亚洲并独霸全世界。
  一九五○年六月，美帝国主义实行他的第一步侵略计划，把罪恶的侵略战争，抛到和平的朝鲜人民身上，公然的宣布侵占我国的领土台湾。
  美帝国主义这只吃人的生番，对于朝鲜的城市和乡村，对于朝鲜的孩子和母亲们，进行了毁灭性的轰炸和烧杀，帝国主义的飞机更不断的越过鸭绿江侵入中国领空，对和平的中国人民肆行轰炸扫射。
  于是，全中国的人民在忍无可忍下掀起了轰轰烈烈抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动。各地人民都踊跃参加志愿军出发到朝鲜前线，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战英勇地把侵略者独霸世界的梦想又一次的完全粉碎。
  美帝国主义不可战胜的神话，在朝鲜战场上彻底的破产了，爱好和平正义的中朝人民，在打击美国侵略者的胜利道路上，勇敢前进。帝国主义者将永远滚出亚洲去。
