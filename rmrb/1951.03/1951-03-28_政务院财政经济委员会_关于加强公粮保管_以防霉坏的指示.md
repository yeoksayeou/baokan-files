    Instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council
    on Strengthening the Storage of Public Grain
    to Prevent Mildew and Spoilage
    Thanks to the strong guidance of governments at all levels, the autumn 1950 public grain requisition has been entirely put into storage, which is a great achievement. Now that spring is approaching and the rainy season in the south is upon us, and given the poor conditions of our national warehouses and the fact that the moisture content of the grain has not yet been reduced to a safe standard, if effective measures are not taken promptly to prevent the grain from absorbing moisture, heating up, molding, and being robbed and sabotaged by bandits and special agents, serious losses will inevitably result. To encourage all localities to strengthen the storage of public grain, in addition to continuing to follow the "Instructions on Strengthening the Storage of Public Grain" issued by this Committee on April 11, 1950, the following key points are briefly reiterated for your attention:
    1. Attach importance to the work of grain storage. Please urge finance committees and financial and grain departments at all levels of government to implement the work of protecting grain. The primary task at present is to overcome all difficulties and protect the public grain in the warehouses so as to minimize or avoid losses.
    2. Thoroughly inspect the quality of grain and handle public grain with high moisture content and mildew. All localities should conduct a thorough inspection and testing of stored grain. All husked grain (such as yellow millet and millet) with a moisture content of more than 14 percent, and unhusked grain (sorghum, wheat, beans) with a moisture content of more than 13 percent, must be turned, ventilated, and dried to reduce the moisture content to below a safe standard. Moldy grain or grain with excessive impurities must be stored separately or sifted and ventilated immediately. If it cannot be preserved, it can be used for brewing, feed, or disposed of by selling.
    3. Conduct in-depth inspections of grain depots. Grain depots found to have defects should be repaired, renovated, or supplemented quickly. For civilian housing used as warehouses on loan, in addition to persuading and mobilizing the masses to continue lending them where it is temporarily impossible to return them, grain stacking methods should be improved, and ventilation and other necessary safety equipment should be added.
    4. Study and create effective methods for preventing sparrows, rats, and insects in many ways. All localities should call on warehouse staff and the masses to study methods for preventing and controlling warehouse pests. Scientific prevention and control methods should be promoted, and sufficient medicine and equipment should be purchased. Pest control institutions should be established, and pest control experts should be hired. Pest control experts should be recruited, and pest control talents should be trained and dispatched to various regions to guide work in key areas, create typical experiences, and promote them to various regions at any time.
    5. Eradicate theft and strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents. Raise vigilance and pay close attention to the security of grain depots. In addition to generally strengthening fire prevention equipment in grain depots, local masses and militia should be mobilized to establish grain protection organizations. Larger grain depots and areas where public security has not yet stabilized should deploy armed public security forces and local troops to guard and assist.
    The above is to be thoroughly communicated and implemented in accordance with local conditions!
                                         Chairman Chen Yun
                               March 26, 1951

    政务院财政经济委员会
    关于加强公粮保管
    以防霉坏的指示
    一九五○年秋征公粮依靠各级人民政府的有力指导，已全部入仓，这是很大的成绩。现时令已届春暖及南方雨多的季节，在我国家仓库条件很坏，粮食水份尚未降到安全标准的情况下，如不及早采取有效措施，预防粮食反潮、发热、霉烂以及土匪特务的抢劫破坏，必将招致严重损失。为引起各地加强公粮保管，除继续遵照本委一九五○年四月十一日“关于加强公粮保管工作的指示”执行外，特再简要指出如下各点，望加注意。
    一、重视粮食保管的工作。请各级人民政府，督促财委及财粮部门贯彻保护粮食的工作。当前首要任务是如何克服一切困难，保护好仓库的公粮，使之少受损失或者免受损失。
    二、彻底检查粮食质量，处理水份高及霉变的公粮。各地应对存粮，进行一次彻底的检查、化验，凡带壳粮（如黄谷、谷子）水份在百分之十四以上，裸粮（高粱、小麦、豆类）水份在百分之十三以上者，必须进行倒仓、翻晒，务使水份降低到安全标准以下。霉变或杂质过多的粮食必须立即分别存储或过筛风晾，不能保存者，可用之于酿造、饲料或以出售方法处理之。
    三、深入检查粮库。对于发现有缺陷的粮库应迅速进行修补、整理或补充；对借用的民房仓库，除暂时无法腾还应说服动员群众继续借用外，并应改善粮食堆装办法，增加通风及其他必要的安全设备。
    四、多方研究与创造防雀、防鼠与防虫的有效办法。各地应号召管仓人员和群众研究防治仓虫办法，对于科学防治方法应加推行，购置足够的药械，设置防虫机构，招聘防虫专家内行，培养与训练仓虫防治人才，有重点地分派各地指导工作，创造典型经验，并随时推广各地。
    五、根绝偷盗，严防土匪特务破坏。提高警惕性，密切注视粮库的保安状况，除普遍加强粮库的防火设备外，并应发动当地群众与民兵，成立护粮组织。较大的粮库和治安尚未稳定的地区，应调派公安武装、地方部队进行守卫与协助。
    以上望深入传达，依据当地具体情况布置进行为荷！
                                         主任  陈云
                               一九五一年三月二十六日
