Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 4th - Sa Zhenbing, a 93-year-old veteran of the Chinese Navy residing in Fuzhou, recently published an open letter to British naval officers and men, informing them of the rapid progress of New China and the ardent love of peace of all its people, and hoping that they would demand that the British government withdraw its troops from the Korean War and oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan in order to safeguard world peace. Sa Zhenbing studied in Britain in his early years and enjoyed great prestige among British naval officers and men. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the British naval officers and men: I once studied naval affairs in your country and have a deep friendship with you. I am now telling you about the situation in New China, and I trust you will believe it. In New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its wise leader Chairman Mao: young people receive a good education, love their country, and love their government; agricultural production has increased sharply, and there is an abundance of food; transportation is convenient and smooth; attention is paid to hygiene and disease prevention. In short, all aspects are progressing by leaps and bounds, and the corrupt habits of the Kuomintang era have been eliminated. The people of New China love peace very much, will never tolerate foreign aggression, and have the strength to defeat any aggressor. However, the American imperialists are not reconciled to the victory of the Chinese people. While carrying out a war of aggression in Korea, which is adjacent to China, they also occupied our Taiwan and want to swallow China. Unfortunately, your government also followed suit and sent troops to participate in this war of aggression, causing countless people to suffer. Zhenbing is indignant about this. At present, American imperialism is actively rearming Japan, preparing for a third world war, which has aroused great anger among all the people of our country. I know very well that your people have also suffered a lot from the Japanese pirates in the past and also oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan and demand peace and trade with our country, which is beneficial to both countries. Zhenbing hopes that you will, based on the natural duty of the navy to defend the country and the people, rise up and demand that your government withdraw British troops from Korea, oppose American aggression, and oppose American rearmament of Japan, in order to help maintain world peace.

　　萨镇冰函英海军将士
    希望促英政府自朝撤兵  反对美国重新武装日本
    【新华社福州四日电】住在福州的中国海军宿将九十三龄的萨镇冰，最近发表了一封致英国海军将校尉士的公开信，告诉他们新中国在飞跃进步和全体人民酷爱和平的情况，并希望他们要求英国政府撤退侵朝英军，反对美国重新武装日本，以利于维护世界和平。萨氏早年曾留学英伦，在英海军将士中很有声望。该信全文如下：
    英国海军将校尉士们：我过去曾在贵国学习海军，与你们有着深厚友谊。我现在告诉你们新中国的情况，谅一定能相信。在中国共产党和自己英明领袖毛主席领导下的新中国：青年都受到良好教育，爱祖国，爱戴自己的政府；农产激增，粮食富足；交通方便畅通；讲究卫生，预防疾病。总之，各方面都在飞跃进步，去掉了国民党时期腐败的恶习。新中国的人民是非常爱好和平，是决不容忍外国侵略的，也有力量击败任何侵略者。可是美帝不甘中国人民胜利，在中国贴邻朝鲜进行侵略战争的时候，又占了我国台湾，还想吞灭中国。不幸贵国政府也跟着派兵参与这场侵略战争，无数人民遭受涂炭。镇冰对此为之激愤。目前美帝国主义又在积极重新武装日本，准备第三次世界大战，这事已引起我国全体人民极大愤怒。我深知贵国人民过去也吃了日寇很多亏，也反对美国重新武装日本，要求和平，与我国通商，这样二国都有益。镇冰希望你们本着海军为保卫国家、保卫人民的天职，起来要求贵国政府撤退在朝鲜的英国军队，反对美国侵略，反对美国重新武装日本，以有利于维护世界和平。
