　　Introduction to "March 8th" International Women's Day

　　"March 8th" International Working Women's Day is a day of commemoration for women all over the world to unite and fight for liberation.

　　This festival originated from the struggle of female workers in Chicago, USA, on March 8, 1909. On that day, female workers in Chicago held a grand strike and demonstration to fight for freedom and equality. Their actions received enthusiastic responses from the vast number of working women in the United States. In 1910, the Second International Socialist Women's Congress was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. At the conference, the German women's leader, who was also the leader of revolutionary women around the world, Clara Zetkin proposed at the conference that March 8th be designated as International Working Women's Day in order to strengthen the solidarity and liberation struggle of international working women. The conference unanimously passed Zetkin's proposal and proposed the implementation of "eight-hour work system," "equal pay for equal work," "protection of motherhood," and "protection of child labor." When commemorating the first "March 8th" International Working Women's Day in 1911, working women in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, the United States, and other countries held demonstrations. Since then, working women all over the world have enthusiastically commemorated their own festival every year.

　　Chinese women first commemorated their festival in 1924. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, working women in Guangzhou united with oppressed women from all walks of life and held a grand memorial meeting in the First Park. They put forward slogans such as "Down with imperialism," "Down with warlords," "Equal pay for equal work," "Protect child labor and pregnant women," "Equal education," "Prohibit child brides and polygamy," "Prohibit keeping maids and concubines," and "Establish child protection laws," and paraded in formation. From 1925 onwards, the commemoration of "March 8th" gradually became popular in major cities. Countless patriotic working women and female communists bravely fought for national independence and liberation and the liberation of women themselves.

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, Chinese working women and revolutionary intellectual women, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, threw themselves into the great struggle for national liberation in large numbers. They actively participated in war mobilization and logistics work, the land reform movement, and the production movement. Chinese women became a powerful component of the Chinese people's revolutionary ranks and made great contributions to the victory of the national revolution.

　　The founding of the People's Republic of China freed Chinese women from the multiple oppressions of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism for many years. For the first time, Chinese women's rights and status were guaranteed by law. Article 6 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women is practiced." Chinese women have stood up. They participate in people's representative conferences and people's government work at all levels the same as men; they participate in various production work the same as men, and they have been allocated land in rural areas where land reform has been implemented the same as men; they also enjoy equal status and rights with men in all aspects of culture and education. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, promulgated on May 1st last year, has brought happiness in marriage to women. Now, the broad masses of Chinese women, like men, have become active builders of the new China. They have achieved brilliant achievements in various jobs.

　　This year's "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is a day of struggle against aggression and for peace. The US imperialists are persisting in their war of aggression against Korea, frantically arming Japan and Germany, and preparing for a new world war. They have placed a major and urgent task before the people of the world: to further strengthen the booming movement to defend peace. The World Peace Council, which recently convened in Berlin, has formulated a program of action for the people of the world to strive for peace and stop new wars. The great struggle to achieve this program is unfolding throughout the world. Chinese women and all the people have always been loyal fighters against aggression and in defense of peace. The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, launched by Chinese women together with the people of the whole country, has made great contributions to the cause of world peace. As we commemorate "March 8th," the task of Chinese women is to work with the people of the whole country to further promote the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, oppose the US arming of Japan, implement land reform, strive for a bumper harvest this year, launch patriotic production competitions, suppress counter-revolutionaries, strengthen patriotic studies, and implement the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea into daily production, work, study, and life, and strive to better complete the tasks of 1951.

### “三八”国际妇女节介绍

　　“三八”国际妇女节介绍
    “三八”国际劳动妇女节是全世界妇女团结起来争取解放的纪念日。
    这个节日，起源于一九零九年三月八日美国芝加哥女工的斗争。在那一天，芝加哥女工为争取自由平等，举行了盛大的罢工与游行示威。她们的行动得到了美国广大劳动妇女的热烈响应。一九一零年国际第二次社会主义者妇女大会在丹麦京城哥本哈根开会时，德国的妇女领袖、也是世界革命妇女的领袖蔡特金在大会上提议，为了加强国际劳动妇女的团结和解放斗争，订三月八日为国际劳动妇女节。大会一致通过了蔡特金的提议，并提出实行“八小时工作制”、“同工同酬”、“保护母性”、“保护童工”等提案。在一九一一年纪念第一个“三八”国际劳动妇女节的时候，德国、奥地利、瑞典、丹麦、美国等国的劳动妇女都举行了示威游行。从此，全世界劳动妇女在每一年都热烈地纪念自己的这一节日。
    中国妇女第一次纪念自己的节日是在一九二四年。在中国共产党的领导下，广州市的劳动妇女联合了各界被压迫妇女在第一公园举行盛大的纪念会，提出了“打倒帝国主义”、“打倒军阀”、“同工同酬”、“保护童工、孕妇”、“同等教育”、“禁止童养媳、多妻制”、“禁止蓄婢、纳妾”、“建立儿童保护法”等口号，并列队游行。从一九二五年起，“三八”节的纪念就逐渐普及于各大城市。无数爱国劳动妇女和女共产党员前仆后继地为民族的独立解放和妇女自身的解放而斗争着。
    在抗日战争与人民解放战争中，中国的劳动妇女和革命的知识妇女在中国共产党的领导下，大批地投入了民族解放的伟大斗争。她们积极地参加了战争动员与后勤工作、土地改革运动和生产运动。中国妇女成为了中国人民革命队伍的有力的组成部分，对全国革命的胜利作了伟大的贡献。
    中华人民共和国的成立，使中国妇女摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义多少年来的重重压迫。中国妇女的权利和地位，第一次得到了法律的保障。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第六条规定：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由。”中国妇女已经站起来了，她们和男子同样地参加了各级人民代表会议和人民政府的工作；和男子同样地参加了各种生产工作，在已实行土地改革的农村中和男子一样地分到了土地；在文化教育各方面也和男子同样享有平等的地位和权利。去年五月一日公布的中华人民共和国婚姻法，更给妇女带来了婚姻的幸福。现在，中国的广大妇女已和男子一样成为新中国的积极建设者。她们在各种工作上都获得了辉煌的成就。
    今年的“三八”国际劳动妇女节是反对侵略、争取和平的斗争节日。美帝国主义者坚持进行侵朝战争、疯狂武装日本和德国以及准备新的世界战争，在全世界人民面前提出了一个重大而迫切的任务，即：进一步加强正在蓬勃发展的保卫和平运动。最近在柏林召开的世界和平理事会已制定了全世界人民争取和平与制止新战争的行动纲领。为争取这个纲领的实现而进行伟大斗争正在全世界展开。中国妇女和全体人民一直是反对侵略、保卫和平的忠诚战士。中国妇女和全国人民一起发动的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，已对世界和平事业作了伟大的贡献。当此纪念“三八”节之际，中国妇女的任务就是与全国人民一道，进一步推行抗美援朝爱国运动，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，反对美国武装日本，实行土地改革，争取今年丰收，展开爱国主义生产竞赛，镇压反革命分子，加强爱国主义学习，把抗美援朝的爱国运动贯穿到日常的生产、工作、学习和生活中去，为更好地完成一九五一年的任务而斗争。
