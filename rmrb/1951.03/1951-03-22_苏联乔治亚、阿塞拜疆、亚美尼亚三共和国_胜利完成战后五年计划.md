Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 21st:

    The Georgian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian Republics of the Soviet Union in the South Caucasus have successfully completed the post-war Five-Year Plan.

    In 1950, the total industrial output of the Georgian Republic exceeded the pre-war level by 52 percent. Its power generation capacity reached 326,000 kilowatts, equivalent to 41 times that of 1913. The scale of industrial construction has expanded by approximately twice as much as before the war. A large number of Stakhanovite workers have emerged in industrial enterprises. In the capital Tbilisi alone, 892 people completed 11 to 15 years of production quotas within five years, and more than 5,000 people completed six to ten years of production quotas. In agriculture, wheat production last year increased by 63 percent compared to 1940. Tea production was 83,000 tons, and grapes were 71,000 tons, representing increases of 78 percent and 65 percent respectively compared to 1948. The area of newly cultivated land in 1950 increased by 14 percent compared to 1949. Last year, the power generation capacity of rural power stations reached 20,000 kilowatts, providing sufficient power to 700 collective farms. Georgia now has 315 "millionaire collective farms" (referring to farms with incomes of over one million rubles), an increase of 267 compared to before the war. There are a total of 4,350 primary and secondary schools with 750,000 students, and 19 institutions of higher education with 35,000 students.

    The Azerbaijani Republic's total industrial production has exceeded the target set by the post-war Five-Year Plan by 13.4 percent, and the national economic asset investment plan has been fulfilled by 137.5 percent. The Baku oil workers exceeded the 1950 plan, producing a large amount of oil, with many workers drilling over 4,000 meters per month using one machine. Cotton production exceeded the Five-Year Plan by 38.8 percent, completing 122 percent of the 1950 plan. From 1946 to 1949, cotton harvests tripled. The original 3,221 collective farms in Azerbaijan have been merged into 1,204 large collective farms. In recent years, the number of tractors has increased by 60 percent.

    The Armenian Republic's total industrial production had already completed the post-war Five-Year Plan by the end of 1949. By the end of 1950, the total industrial output had reached three times the pre-war level. Last year's cotton harvest was 150 percent of the pre-war level, sugar beet was 250 percent, tobacco was 200 percent, and potatoes were over 300 percent. In 1950, the cultivated land area increased nearly sixfold compared to 1919, and the irrigated land more than doubled. Over 80 percent of land cultivation work has been mechanized. Last year, the number of cattle increased by 30.6 percent compared to before the war, and sheep increased by 80.6 percent. In 1950, the number of employees increased by 60 percent compared to 1940, the wage fund increased by 177 percent, and the average worker's wage approximately doubled. The cash remuneration for labor days in general collective farms has doubled, while in collective farms producing technical crops, the cash remuneration for labor days has increased four to fivefold. Modern agricultural towns have begun to be constructed throughout the country. The number of students in ten-year schools reaches 300,000.
