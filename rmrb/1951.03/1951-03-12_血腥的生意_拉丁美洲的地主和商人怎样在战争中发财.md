　　Bloody Business
    ——How Latin American Landlords and Merchants Profited from the War
        Méidēngkē
    “In reality, the United Nations is now less of a global organization and more of an American organization catering to the needs of American aggressors. Not only are the United States and Canada trying to start another war, but the twenty Latin American countries are also taking this path. The landlords and merchants in these countries are eager for new wars to break out in Europe or Asia, so that they can sell goods to the warring countries at particularly inflated prices, and make a fortune in this bloody business. It is no secret to anyone that the twenty representatives from the twenty Latin American countries now form the most united and docile American team in the United Nations.”
            ——Excerpt from Stalin's interview with a Pravda reporter

  I. Landlords and Merchants
    The twenty Latin American countries are basically agricultural countries, producing a large amount of industrial raw materials and grain. These countries have long been under the aggression and control of imperialist countries, and remain semi-colonies and colonies of foreign capitalists, especially American capitalists, to this day. The United States has a direct investment of 3.25 billion US dollars in Latin America alone, accounting for more than one-third of the United States' foreign investment. Although Britain has been squeezed out by the United States, causing its investment in Latin America to decrease day by day, it still had more than 560 million pounds in 1949, while in 1931, when the investment was at its highest, it had as much as 1.15 billion pounds. Such huge investments control the economic lifeline of Latin American countries. Of course, the imperialists, mainly the American imperialists, also politically control these countries.

    The imperialists keep a group of puppets in these countries. These puppets are representatives of the domestic landlords and merchants in Latin American countries. They serve as servants of the imperialists on the one hand, and rule those countries on the other.

    Land is very concentrated in Latin America, and large landlords control most of the agricultural production. Just a few examples can show this: fifteen wealthy families in Argentina own 7 million acres of land; three-thousandths of the largest landlords in Chile occupy more than 52% of the country's arable land; three percent of the largest landlords in Venezuela occupy 70% of the country's arable land; and 2% of the population in Brazil (calculated by adults) occupy 90% of the country's arable land. It is this small group of landlord parasites that controls the production of coffee, cocoa, sugar, wheat, wool, cotton, etc., which are the major exports of Latin America. Foreign capitalists also control the agricultural production of Latin America. For example, the American United Fruit Company almost controls all agricultural production in Central American countries, and American capitalists own 78% of Cuba's arable land!

    Minerals occupy an important position in the economies of Latin American countries. However, the exploitation of minerals in Latin America is mostly controlled by American capital. American capital controls most of the mining industry in Mexico and South America. It controls almost the entire production of iron sand, bauxite, manganese and platinum, as well as more than nine-tenths of copper, seven-tenths of silver, two-thirds of zinc and more than half of oil, etc. Some countries that produce minerals mainly make money by exporting minerals. For example, Venezuela's oil accounts for more than 95% of its total exports; 98% of Bolivia's exports are minerals, of which tin alone accounts for 70% of the total export value; and 80% of Chile's exports are minerals, of which copper alone accounts for more than 50% of the total export value. Foreign capitalists and domestic merchants make their fortunes from these huge exports.

    It is these people who long for war and desire to share the profits of war. Many of the items produced in Latin America are important strategic materials or grain that is indispensable in peacetime and wartime. When war breaks out, these things will have great potential. Landlords and merchants are thus waiting for the opportunity of war to do their bloody business.

  II. Profiteering During the War
    In the past two world wars, Latin American countries watched the fire from the other side of the river and did their business. Not to mention the distant past, we can see how they made a fortune from the Second World War.

    Before and after its participation in the war, the United States negotiated and signed contracts with Latin American countries, and almost monopolized the purchase of various strategic minerals. In addition to minerals, the United States also purchased sisal hemp from Mexico for naval use, balsa wood from Ecuador for making airplanes, quinine from Peru and Bolivia, and rubber from Brazil, Peru and Bolivia. As a result, Latin America's exports to the United States increased sharply. In 1938, the export value to the United States was 450 million US dollars, which increased to 1.3 billion US dollars in 1943 and 1.626 billion US dollars in 1945. Some countries that usually traded more with Britain also increased their exports to Britain during the war. For example, compared with 1944 and 1938, Argentina's export value to Britain increased by more than doubled, Brazil increased by one and a quarter times, and Cuba also doubled. In 1938, Latin America's exports accounted for 7.8% of the world's total exports, which increased to 13.6% in 1946.

    These greatly increased exports were also sold at high prices. The prices of many minerals and grains during the war were raised to more than double the normal prices. For example, the price of mica increased threefold, the price of manganese increased by 50%, and the price of wheat in Argentina increased by 250%.

    As a result, Latin American landlords and merchants (of course, as well as foreign capitalists) made a fortune during the Second World War. At the end of 1938, the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the twenty Latin American countries were only 768 million US dollars, which increased to 3.93 billion US dollars in 1946. Among them, Argentina gained the most, accounting for 1.696 billion US dollars, accounting for 43% of the total. The next few countries were: Brazil with 760 million US dollars, Uruguay with 291 million US dollars, and Cuba with 266 million US dollars. Bolivia had only 5 million US dollars in foreign exchange reserves before the war in 1939, which increased to 26 million US dollars in 1945; Chile also increased from 36 million US dollars to 100 million US dollars during the same period.

    After the end of the war, due to the American imperialism's active implementation of its expansion policy and preparation for launching another war, Latin America's strategic materials still maintained a certain amount of exports to the United States; however, the large-scale dumping of goods by American capitalists in Latin America turned Latin America's trade surplus with the United States into a trade deficit. In 1946, Latin America's trade deficit with the United States was 300 million US dollars, which jumped to 1.7 billion US dollars in 1947. The fortunes made by Latin American countries during the war went into the pockets of American capitalists again, and their foreign exchange reserves earned during the war were almost spent by 1949. This aggressive policy of American imperialism brought serious financial crises and difficulties in foreign exchange supply to those countries. After 1948, Latin American countries had to adopt a policy of controlling foreign exchange, and some countries were even forced to implement currency devaluation to balance the dollar's income and expenditure.

    The reactionary governments of Latin American countries, representing the interests of foreign capitalists and domestic landlords and merchants, faced with the difficulties after the war, really hoped for another war and another fortune in the war. Chilean President Videla publicly stated as early as June 1947 that he believed that a US-Soviet war would break out within three months. Argentina had as much as 1.5 billion US dollars in food and raw material stocks in 1949. President Perón was anxiously waiting for the war to break out. As long as the war broke out, his stocks could be sold at a hundredfold profit without having to be sold off at a reduced price.

  III. Bloody Business Again
    Since American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, Latin American landlords and merchants have once again started their bloody business. One month after the outbreak of the war, in July 1950, twelve of the twenty Latin American countries had a trade surplus with the United States. In the past year, Latin American countries have turned from a trade deficit to a trade surplus for the first time since 1946. We can see that: the wool and meat markets in Argentina and Uruguay are flooded with US dollars. The Uruguayan peso had originally devalued after the devaluation of the British pound in 1949, but at the end of last year it abolished the fixed exchange rate with the pound and appreciated. Coffee planters in Brazil, Colombia and Central American countries made a lot of money due to soaring coffee prices. Brazil repaid the commercial debt of 125 million US dollars owed to importers within a few months after the outbreak of the war. Cuban sugar merchants were still worried about the overproduction of sugar last March, but after the outbreak of the Korean War, American merchants snapped up the sugar. Mine owners in Venezuela also made a fortune in the iron sand business. Mexico originally planned to devalue the peso, but now it is talking about appreciating the peso.

    The people of Korea are suffering unprecedented disasters in the American war of aggression. The American aggressors barbarously massacre the Korean people, bombard and burn the homes, fields and cities of the Korean people; however, those capitalists who make a fortune from the war, as well as the landlords and merchants in Latin America, are doing their bloody business in this barbaric and brutal war. These people are afraid that the world will not be chaotic, afraid that the Korean War will end soon, and afraid that another war will not break out somewhere else, so that they can make this unconscionable fortune. Latin American landlords and merchants are very obedient to the American big capitalists, in order to share some of the war profits. Therefore, the representatives of those countries in the United Nations formed the most united and docile American team, and under the direction of American imperialism, they acted as its voting machine, turning the United Nations into a tool for launching another world war.

    However, the people will not allow imperialism to launch another war. The people of the world will defend peace and stop war with the greatest strength. The people of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers will fight bravely until the American and British aggressors are completely defeated. The people of Latin America are also firmly opposed to war. The peace movement is rapidly and widely developing in Latin American countries. Peace-loving people will unite to prevent the outbreak of war and maintain lasting peace.

　　血腥的生意
    ——拉丁美洲的地主和商人怎样在战争中发财
        梅登科
    “实际上，现在联合国与其说是世界性组织，还不如说是迎合美国侵略者需要的美洲人的组织。不仅是美国和加拿大在力图发动另一次战争，而且拉丁美洲二十国家，也采取了这一条道路，这些国家的地主和商人，渴望在欧洲或亚洲的某些地方爆发新的战争，以便以特别高的价格，向交战各国出售货物，而在这种血腥的生意中大发横财。拉丁美洲二十个国家的二十个代表，现在在联合国中组成了最一致、最驯顺的美国队伍，这一点对任何人都不是秘密的了。”
            ——摘自斯大林对真理报记者的谈话
  一  地主和商人
    拉丁美洲的二十个国家基本上都是农业国，出产着大量的工业原料和粮食。这些国家长期在帝国主义国家的侵略和控制之下，到今天仍然是外国资本家特别是美国资本家的半殖民地和殖民地。美国在拉丁美洲仅直接投资就达三十二亿五千万美元，占美国国外投资三分之一以上。英国虽然受着美国的排挤，致使它在拉丁美洲的投资日见减少，但一九四九年时仍有五亿六千万余英镑，而在投资额最高的一九三一年，却有着十一亿五千万英镑之多。这么巨额的投资控制了拉丁美洲各国的经济命脉。当然，帝国主义者主要是美帝国主义者也就在政治上控制了这些国家。
    帝国主义在这些国家豢养着一批傀儡，这些傀儡便是拉丁美洲各国国内的地主商人的代表，他们一方面当着帝国主义的仆从，一方面统治着那些国家。
    拉丁美洲的土地非常集中，大地主控制了大部的农业生产。只要举几个例子就可以看出来了：阿根廷十五个富有家族拥有七百万英亩的土地，智利的地主中千分之三的大地主占有全国耕地百分之五十二以上，委内瑞拉地主中百分之三的大地主占有全国耕地百分之七十，巴西百分之二的人口（以成年人计算）占有全国耕地百分之九十。就是这一小撮的地主寄生虫控制着拉丁美洲大宗出口的咖啡、可可、白糖、小麦、羊毛、棉花等的生产。外国资本家也控制着拉丁美洲的农业生产，譬如美国的联合水果公司几乎控制了中美洲各国的全部农业生产，而美国资本家竟占有古巴耕地百分之七十八！
    矿产在拉丁美洲各国的经济中占有重要的地位。但是，拉丁美洲矿产的开采绝大部分是由美国资本控制的。美国资本控制了墨西哥和南美洲绝大部分的矿业，它控制了几乎整个的铁砂、铁矾土、锰和铂的生产，以及十分之九以上的铜、十分之七的银、三分之二的锌和一半以上的石油等的生产。有些出产矿物的国家主要是靠输出矿产来赚钱的。譬如委内瑞拉的石油占全部出口比重百分之九十五以上，玻利维亚出口的百分之九十八是矿产，其中仅锡一项即占全部出口值的百分之七十，智利出口的百分之八十是矿产，其中铜一项即占全部出口值百分之五十以上。外国资本家和本国的商人就从这些巨量出口中发他们的财。
    就是这些人渴望着战争，渴望着分享战争的利润。拉丁美洲所出产的物品很多是重要的战略物资或是平时和战时都不可缺少的粮食，打起仗来，这些东西就大有出路。地主和商人们就这样等着战争的机会来做他们血腥的生意。
  二  战争中大发横财
    在过去两次世界大战中，拉丁美洲的国家隔岸观火，大做他们的生意。远的不说，就从第二次世界大战中便可以看到它们怎样大发横财了。
    美国在参战前后便与拉丁美洲各国谈判订约，几乎独占了各种战略矿产的购买。除矿产外，美国亦搜购了墨西哥供海军用的西沙尔麻，厄瓜多尔的制飞机用的巴沙木，秘鲁和玻利维亚的奎宁，巴西、秘鲁和玻利维亚的橡胶等。于是，拉丁美洲对美输出大增，一九三八年时对美出口值为四亿五千万美元，一九四三年增至十三亿元，一九四五年增至十六亿二千六百万元。一些在平时与英国贸易较多的国家在战争中亦同样增加了对英国的输出。例如，以一九四四年和一九三八年比较，阿根廷对英出口值增加了一倍以上，巴西增加了一又四分之一倍，古巴亦增加了一倍。一九三八年时拉丁美洲出口占全世界出口总额百分之七点八，一九四六年增加至百分之十三点六。
    这些大量增加的出口物品而且是以高价来出售的，许多矿产和粮食在战时的价格都提到平时的一倍到两倍以上。譬如云母的价格增加了三倍，锰的价格增加了百分之五十，阿根廷的小麦价格增加了百分之二百五十。
    于是，拉丁美洲的地主和商人（当然，还有外国资本家）在第二次世界大战中便大发横财了。一九三八年年底时，拉丁美洲二十个国家的黄金和外汇储备仅为七亿六千八百万美元，一九四六年竟增至三十九亿三千万美元。其中获利最多的是阿根廷，它占了十六亿九千六百万美元，为总数的百分之四十三。以次的几个国家是：巴西占七亿六千万美元，乌拉圭二亿九千一百万美元，古巴二亿六千六百万美元。玻利维亚战前一九三九年只有外汇储备五百万美元，一九四五年增至二千六百万美元；智利在同一时期内亦由三千六百万美元增至一亿美元。
    战争结束以后，由于美帝国主义积极推行其扩张政策，准备发动另一次战争，拉丁美洲的战略物资还是维持着一定的对美输出；但是，美国资本家对拉丁美洲的大量倾销货物，却使拉丁美洲对美贸易的出超一变而为入超了。一九四六年拉丁美洲自美国入超三亿美元，一九四七年竟一跃而至十七亿美元。拉丁美洲各国战时所发的横财又跑进美国资本家的荷包里去，它们战时所赚得的外汇储备到一九四九年时便差不多花光了。美帝国主义的这种侵略政策，给那些国家带来了严重的财政危机和外汇供给方面的困难。一九四八年后，拉丁美洲各国便不得不采取控制外汇的政策，有的国家还被迫实行货币贬值来平衡美元的收支。
    代表外国资本家和本国地主商人利益的拉丁美洲各国的反动政府，面临着战后的困难，它们着实希望再来一次战争，再在战争中发财。智利总统维德拉早在一九四七年六月时就公开发表谈话说，他相信美苏战争在三个月内就要爆发。阿根廷一九四九年时粮食和原料的存货多达十五亿美元，裴隆总统焦急着战争还不打起来，只要打仗，他的存货就可以利市百倍，用不着跌价地推销出去。
  三  又是血腥的生意
    美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争以后，拉丁美洲的地主和商人又做起他们的血腥的生意来了。战争发生后一个月，一九五○年七月的时候，拉丁美洲二十个国家中便有十二个对美国的贸易是出超的。在去年一年中，拉丁美洲各国自一九四六年以来，第一次从贸易上的入超转为出超了。我们可以看到：阿根廷和乌拉圭的羊毛及肉类市场上泛滥着美元。乌拉圭货币比索在一九四九年英镑贬值后本来也跟着贬值了的，但去年年底它便取销了对英镑的固定汇率而升值了。巴西、哥伦比亚和中美洲各国的咖啡园主由于飞涨的咖啡价格而大赚其钱。巴西在战争发生后几个月内便还清了欠入口商的一亿二千五百万美元的商业债务，古巴的糖商在去年三月还在为白糖的生产过剩而发愁，可是朝鲜战争发生后美国商人便把白糖抢购一空了。委内瑞拉的矿山主也在铁砂的生意上发了财。墨西哥原来计划把比索贬值，现在却在谈论着比索升值了。
    朝鲜的人民在美国的侵略战争中遭受着空前的灾难，美国的侵略军野蛮地屠杀朝鲜的人民、轰炸烧毁朝鲜人民的房屋、田园和城市；但是，那些靠战争发财的资本家，同样地拉丁美洲那些地主和商人，却在这野蛮残暴的战争中做他们血腥的生意。这些人唯恐天下不乱，唯恐朝鲜的战争早日结束，唯恐不在其他什么地方发生另一个战争，好让他们去发这丧尽天良的横财。拉丁美洲的地主和商人非常听从美国大资本家的话，为的是要分享一些战争利润。所以，那些国家在联合国的代表们便组成了最一致、最驯顺的美国队伍，在美帝国主义的指使下，当它的投票机器，把联合国日益变成发动另一次世界大战的工具了。
    但是，人民是不容许帝国主义再发动战争的，全世界人民将以最大的力量来保卫和平、制止战争。朝鲜的人民和中国人民志愿部队将英勇地战斗下去，直到美英侵略者完全失败为止，拉丁美洲的人民亦一样坚决地反对战争，和平运动正在拉丁美洲各国迅速广泛地开展，爱好和平的人民将团结起来阻止战争的发生、维护持久的和平。
