The Yi people of Xikang Province and the Yao people of Guangzhou write letters to Chairman Mao
Reporting their happiness after liberation
[This newspaper report] The Yi people of Sanwanhe, Zhaojue County, Xikang Province, A-shuo A-qie, and the Yao people's representative Fang Hongbaiyi from the Beijiang Special District, Guangdong Province, wrote letters to Chairman Mao to report on the situation after liberation. The translated version of A-shuo A-qie's original letter is as follows:
　　This letter is written to the comrades of the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, please bring these words back to Beijing to report to Chairman Mao.
　　In ancient times, it was said that there were Han people who wanted to help us Yi people in construction, but in fact they neither cared about us nor helped us. Later, when the Han people Deng Xiuting ruled Xikang, he became even more violent. The number of Yi people killed by him is simply countless. He sent us to carry thousands, tens of thousands of taels of silver for him, and those who could not carry it were killed. After that, the 24th Army of the Kuomintang became superficially friendly, saying that they didn't want our silver or our grain: but they took everything, silver and grain, and those who couldn't carry it were arrested and imprisoned, and they couldn't be released unless they paid the silver and grain. Now that Chairman Mao has come to lead us, the small pigs raised by our Yi women and children can grow into big pigs, and the chickens they raise can also grow bigger. Men can also make a fortune producing buckwheat. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, even people will become talented. Could Chairman Mao have fallen from the sky or transformed from a god who emerged from the ground? Chairman Mao is even better than our parents. If parents supported their descendants like this, their descendants would not be untalented. When the Kuomintang was in power, everyone was forced to die, but now that Chairman Mao leads us, everyone is happy in their hearts. The Yi people of the Daliang Mountains never thought that there would be such a person as Chairman Mao to lead us! We would be happy if Chairman Mao could live to be three hundred and sixty years old! When all of us Yi people hear Chairman Mao's words, there is not one who does not stand up to express their respect.
                                                  A-shuo A-qie, in his own handwriting
　　The letter from Fang Hongbaiyi and others is as follows:
　　Dear Chairman Mao:
　　We are the Yao people of the Beijiang District, Guangdong Province. Fang Hongbaiyi, who represented our Yao people in the National Day anniversary celebration in Beijing, brought back the photos and commemorative badges you and Commander-in-Chief Zhu gave us, and we are very happy.
　　In the past, the Kuomintang government did not treat us as human beings. They called us "Yao dogs." They often sent troops to attack us, burn our houses, rob our things, kill our brothers, and rape our sisters. When we went to the market, the Kuomintang government forced us to collect money. Under their oppression and exploitation, our lives became poorer and poorer. At that time, we all said that the Han people were bad and did not dare to associate with them.
　　Since liberation, the situation has been very different. In the past, we could not enter the government, but today the People's Government often calls us to meetings. Last June, you knew that we had no rations, so you distributed relief grain to us. When the weather turned cold in winter, you remembered that we had no cotton clothes to wear, and you gave us winter clothes. Only then did we realize that the Han people are our brothers, not bad people; the bad people are the Kuomintang reactionaries.
　　This time, the Beijiang Prefectural Office invited us to a meeting. The meeting decided: First, our Yao people must unite with the Han people and follow you forever; Second, we must organize ourselves, establish a militia, and eliminate bandits; If bad landlords and despots want to escape to our Yaoshan Mountains, we have decided not to allow them to step into our Yaoshan Mountains; Third, we must work hard and develop production.
　　Dear Chairman Mao: We represent more than 40,000 Yao people in the Beijiang District to salute you. With you, we can turn over and have the good days we have today. We will never forget you in our whole lives. We will follow you forever.

### 西康彝族和广州瑶族人民写信给毛主席  报告他们解放后的快乐

　　西康彝族和广州瑶族人民写信给毛主席
    报告他们解放后的快乐
    【本报讯】西康省昭觉县三湾河彝民阿硕阿且和广东省北江专区徭族人民代表房红白一等写信向毛主席报告解放后的情况。阿硕阿且的原信译文如下：
    这封信写给中央西南各民族访问团的同志们，请把这些话带回北京报告毛主席。
    古时候听说是曾经要帮我们彝族建设的汉人，事实上对我们既不关心，也没有帮助过。后来到汉人邓秀廷统治西康的时候，他就越发厉害起来了。我们彝人被他杀死的简直数不清了。他派我们背千、万的银子给他，背不起的便被杀掉了。再以后，二十四军、国民党表面上和善起来了，他们口里说既不要我们的银子，也不吃我们的粮：但银子和粮什么都让他们拿光了，背不起的被抓到监牢里关起，除非把银子、粮交清是放不出来的。今后毛主席来领导我们了，我们彝人妇女小孩喂养的小猪可以长成大猪，养的鸡也可以长大了。男人生产撤荞子也可以发财了。在毛主席领导之下，连人也会变得成材了。毛主席大概是从天上掉下来的或是从地下钻出来的神转化成的吧？毛主席比我们父母还好。父母要是这样扶植他们的子孙，他们的子孙就不会有不成材的了。以前国民党在的时候，没有人不是被逼得要死的，现在毛主席领导我们，我们所有的人没有心里不高兴的，大凉山的彝民真想不到会有毛主席这样一个人来领导啊！毛主席能活三百六十岁我们才高兴！我们所有的彝人听到毛主席的话的时候，没有一个不站起来表示敬意的。
                                                  阿硕阿且亲笔
    房红白一等的信如下：
    亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是广东省北江区的徭族人民。代表我们徭族人民参加开国周年纪念大会的房红白一从北京回来，带来你和朱总司令送给我们的相片和纪念章，我们十分高兴。
    过去国民党政府不把我们当人看待，他们叫我们做“徭狗”。他们常常派兵攻打我们。烧我们的房屋，抢我们的东西，杀我们的兄弟，强奸我们的姐妹，我们去赶集，国民党政府要强迫征收我们的钱。在它们的压迫和剥削下，我们的日子越过越穷。那时，我们都说汉人不好，不敢和汉人来往。
    解放以后，情况大不同了。过去我们不能入官府，今天人民政府经常叫我们去开会。去年六月，你知道我们没有口粮，就发救济谷给我们。冬天天气冷了，你记挂着我们没有棉衣穿，又发寒衣给我们。我们才知道：汉人是我们的兄弟，不是坏人；坏人是国民党反动派。
    这次，北江专署请我们来开会。会中决定：第一，我们徭族人民要和汉人团结起来，永远跟着你走；第二，我们要组织起来，建立民兵，肃清土匪；坏蛋的地主恶霸想逃避到我们徭山里来，我们决定不准他们走进我们徭山半步；第三，我们要勤耕勤种，发展生产。
    亲爱的毛主席：我们代表北江区四万多徭民向你敬礼。有了你，我们才能翻身，我们才有今天的好日子。我们一生一世也忘不了你。我们永远跟着你走。
