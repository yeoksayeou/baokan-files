　　The Volume Markings on Railway Vehicles Must Be Accurate Editor:
    I work at the Zhengzhou Engineering Office of the China Construction Company. I often find that the volume marked on some open wagons of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau does not match the actual volume, and some open wagons do not even have the volume marked. For example, the marked height of open wagon No. 3402 (30 tons) is 1 meter, but the actual height is 0.9 meters; the marked width of open wagon No. 461185 (40 tons) is 2.8 meters, but the actual width is 2.7 meters; the marked width of open wagon No. 361176 (30 tons) is 2.7 meters, but the actual width is 2.8 meters. Many wagons do not have length and height markings. This can easily lead to errors in the amount of loading, which, in addition to affecting transportation, is also a hazard to traffic safety. I hope the Ministry of Railways can conduct an inspection of this and correctly mark the capacity and volume of open wagons.

### 铁路车辆的容积标志要准确

　　铁路车辆的容积标志要准确编辑同志：
    我在中国建筑公司郑州工程处工作。我常常发现郑州铁路局有些敞车上面所标志的容积与实际容积不符，甚至有的敞车没有标志容积。如三十吨三四○二号车标高一米，实际高零点九米；四十吨四六一一八五号车标宽二点八米，实际宽二点七米；三十吨三六一一七六号车标宽二点七米，实际宽二点八米。很多车长和高都没有标志。这样很容易引起装载量的错误，除了影响运输外，对行车安全也有妨害。希望铁道部能对此进行检查，正确标订出敞车的容量和体积。
