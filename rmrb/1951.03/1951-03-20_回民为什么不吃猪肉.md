　　Why Muslims Don't Eat Pork
　　Professor Ma Jian, Peking University

　　Pork is the main meat consumed by Chinese people, and Muslims are also Chinese. Moreover, they live in mixed communities with Han people in most areas, yet they do not eat pork. Why don't Muslims eat pork? Han people certainly don't know, and most Muslims can't give a reason either. "Doubts lead to questions" is human nature, so Han people often ask Muslims this question. Muslims cannot give a satisfactory answer, so they don't want others to ask them this question. Muslims not eating pork is strange enough; not allowing others to ask is even stranger, making it seem somewhat mysterious.

　　Between Han and Muslim compatriots, because of this issue, in the era of reactionary rule, many frictions and disputes occurred, affecting the unity and mutual assistance between Han and Muslim compatriots. In the era of the people's democratic dictatorship, I believe this issue still needs clarification.

　（一）Ancient Ethnic Groups' Views on Pigs

　　Ancient Egyptians considered pigs to be filthy, and pig herders were not allowed to enter temples. Greeks and Romans, however, used pigs as sacrificial offerings for atonement. Except for the Babylonians, Semitic peoples did not eat pork. Harranians usually did not eat pork, but they would eat it once a year.

　　The ancestors of the Han people ate pork, but they used cattle when sacrificing to heaven and earth, hence the character for "sacrifice" (犧) includes the radical for "cattle" (牛). The Book of Rites says: "Burning firewood at the Taidan is for sacrificing to heaven; burying at the Taizhe is for sacrificing to earth, using a red calf." (Sacrificial Laws). When sacrificing to ancestral temples or mountains and rivers, or when consecrating bells, cattle or sheep were mostly used, such as the "announcement of the new moon with a gift of sheep," which is a clear example. They had a good view of sheep, so characters like "beautiful" (美), "good" (善), "righteousness" (義), and "auspicious" (祥) all include the radical for "sheep" (羊). They considered cattle and sheep to be more noble than pigs, therefore, the Book of Rites says: "The emperor uses a sacrificial ox, the feudal lords use a fat ox, the high officials use an ox, and the scholars use sheep and pigs." (Book of Rites). It also says: "Feudal lords do not kill cattle without reason, high officials do not kill sheep without reason, and scholars do not kill dogs and pigs without reason." (Royal Regulations). This was probably because pigs are not clean. The I Ching, Kui Hexagram: "Line 9 at the top, alienated and isolated, sees a pig carrying mud." Cheng Yi's commentary says: "Estrangement reaches its extreme, leading to universal suspicion. Seeing the third line is like seeing a pig's filth, carrying mud on its back, indicating extreme aversion." The Shuo Gua (Commentary on the Trigrams) says: "Kan represents the pig." Zhouyi Daquan says: "The front and back are all yin and turbid, and the center is rigid and restless, that is the pig." Li Shizhen said: "According to Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi: 'The character 豕 (pig) resembles hair and feet with a tail at the end.' Lin's Xiaoshuo says: 'Pigs eat unclean things, hence they are called pigs.' 'Kan represents the pig,' a water animal, with a downward tendency and fondness for filth." (Compendium of Materia Medica, Volume 50, Animal Section). Pigs like to eat filth, so ancient people kept pigs in toilets. Therefore, the character 溷 (hun) has two meanings: (1) the place where pigs live (see Cangjie Pian), (2) toilet (see Shuowen Jiezi); the character 廁 (ce) also has two meanings: (1) toilet, (2) to raise pigs. From this, it can be seen that in ancient China, pigs were usually raised in toilets, so their status was very low.

　（二）Ethnic Groups That Do Not Eat Pork Now

　　Everyone knows that Chinese Muslims do not eat pork, but they do not know that various brotherly ethnic groups within the country who believe in Islam, as well as Muslims around the world—including millions of Muslims in the Soviet Union—also do not eat pork. Most Mongolians do not eat it. Hindus also do not eat it. The Japanese people only started eating pork after the Meiji Restoration (late 19th century). On the islands of Madagascar and Polynesia, pigs are taboo. Men of the Bantu people of South Africa do not eat pork. Daughters of the Zulu people of South Africa do not eat pork because they fear that after eating pork, their appearance will become as ugly as a pig. The Caribs of northern South America do not eat pork because, like most primitive peoples, they believe that a person's physique and character are largely related to the food they eat, so they fear that after eating pork, their eyes will become as small as pig's eyes.

　（三）Why Does Islam Forbid Eating Pork?

　　Islam acknowledges that mankind is the master of the world, ruling the world as the agent of Allah (God), and that all things in the world are for human use and enjoyment. Therefore, the Quran says:

　　　　"He (Allah) made you successors on the earth." (6:165)

　　　　"Allah is He Who has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through it by His command, that ye may seek of His bounty, and that ye may be grateful. And He has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and on earth; behold, in that are signs indeed for those who reflect." (45:12, 13)

　　　　"He it is Who created for you all that is on earth." (2:29)

　　All things in the world are for human use and enjoyment, so Islam permits people to eat all kinds of lawful and good foods. The Quran says:

　　"O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of the Evil One; for he is to you an avowed enemy." (2:168)

　　Lawful food is food obtained by lawful means; good food is pure, palatable, and nutritious food. Following the footsteps of the Evil One refers to the Arabs of the pre-Islamic era, who, due to feudal superstitions, abstained from various lawful and good foods.

　　At that time, they did not know about hygiene and often ate dead cattle, sheep, and camels, as well as the blood that flowed out during slaughter, and also ate pork. Therefore, the Quran describes Muhammad's mission as saying:

　　　　"He commands them what is just, and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure)." (7:156)

　　The Quran points out that there are only four kinds of impure foods: (1) carrion, (2) blood, (3) pork, and (4) animals sacrificed in the name of idols.

　　　　"He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name has been invoked besides that of Allah." (2:173)

　　　　"Say: 'I find not in the message received by me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine,- for it is an abomination - or what is impious, on which a name has been invoked, other than Allah's.'" (6:145)

　　Why it is forbidden to eat carrion, blood, and animals sacrificed in the name of those other than Allah cannot be explained in this article due to space limitations.

　　The pig is the least clean of all livestock. Unlike cattle and sheep, it does not choose its food. Therefore, common pigs often suffer from various diseases, so pork has more harm than good.

　　Ancient Chinese medical scholars unanimously acknowledged that pork is the root of many diseases, but they knew only that, and not why. Modern medical scientists, with the help of microscopes and other scientific instruments, have further proven that parasites in pork are the root of many diseases. Islam's prohibition of eating pork is precisely from the perspective of cleanliness and hygiene.

　（四）Criticism and Self-Criticism

　　In the north and south provinces, Muslims and Han people live in mixed communities. Han people often eat pork, but Muslims absolutely do not. Han people, unable to get a correct explanation, have come up with all sorts of far-fetched explanations.

　　Some people say: "The Muslim scriptures say: 'Do not eat various meats,' and Muslims do not know Chinese characters, so they do not eat pork." This is a Buddhist point of view, a "thinking for granted" saying. Muslim scriptures are in Arabic, not Chinese. How could they misunderstand the character "various" (诸) as the character "pig" (猪)?

　　Some people say: "Muslims regard pigs as deities, so they dare not eat pork. There is even a bronze pig head enshrined in the mosque." This is simply fantasy and slander. Islam is absolutely monotheistic. It worships nothing but Allah (Alla). How could Muslims regard pigs as deities?

　　The Chinese people's revolution has succeeded, and the people of the whole country have stood up. Our ethnic minorities have political equality. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the leader of all ethnic groups in the country, and the Chinese Communist Party, no one dares to insult us anymore. We have absolute freedom to maintain or reform our religious beliefs and customs. No one may force or interfere. This is what we should thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party for.

　　The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's ethnic policy is completely correct and will be fully implemented without a doubt. However, some individual workers do not have sufficient understanding, cannot grasp the policy, and do not know how to respect the customs of ethnic minorities, so that some Muslims doubt the Common Program. This is worthy of our attention.

　　As far as I know, some workers have made sarcastic remarks about Muslim cadres and workers who do not eat pork, saying that they are feudal and superstitious and have ideological problems, making them unable to work with peace of mind, and even forced by the environment, they cannot but yield or resign voluntarily. I think this is a kind of left-leaning infantilism, with Han chauvinism subconsciously at play. This is extremely harmful to the unity of all ethnic groups in the country. As for Muslim cadres and workers, eating pork may not improve their thinking; being divorced from the Muslim masses, however, can be guaranteed.

　　In my opinion, whether or not to eat pork has nothing to do with ideological progress. We all know that Marx and Einstein were both Jews who did not eat pork, but Marx invented dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and Einstein invented the theory of relativity, both making epoch-making great contributions to social science and natural science. We all also know that the war criminal Bai Chongxi ate pork casually, but his thinking was so reactionary. From this, it can be seen that people who do not eat pork can also make ideological progress; people who eat pork may not necessarily have no ideological problems. Eating or not eating pork is absolutely not a measure of thinking.

　　Our Muslim compatriots do not have sufficient understanding of the pork issue, resulting in various incorrect views and improper behaviors, forming narrow nationalism, which should also be deeply examined. We ourselves should bear some responsibility for the various misunderstandings and slanders of us by Han compatriots.

　　There are a total of three explicit statements in the Quran about abstaining from pork (Chapter 2, Verse 173; Chapter 5, Verse 3; Chapter 6, Verse 145), each with the two characters for pork (猪肉), but these two characters have not contaminated the Quran. When everyone recites those three explicit statements, there is no expression. When everyone speaks Chinese, why spit when mentioning the two characters for pork, expressing disgust? I think this is a meaningless act; making this expression in front of Han compatriots is impolite. How would you feel if someone spat when mentioning the two characters for beef?

　　Most Muslims taboo the character "pig" (猪), thus causing many jokes.

　　Muslims in the southeast participated in the peasant revolution of Zhu Yuanzhang, the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty, and made great contributions. Zhu Yuanzhang, in order to reward their merits, bestowed upon them the surname Zhu, which was an supreme honor in the autocratic era. But now, when someone asks those descendants of meritorious officials what their surname is, they feel very embarrassed. They believe that Zhu Yuanzhang asking Muslims to have the surname Zhu was a "wicked" thing. It is said that some have changed their surname to Hei (black), but it is not certain.

　　The Quran (18:94, 21:96) mentions the two ancient peoples of Gog and Magog (Yajuj and Majuj), and some ignorant Muslims have proposed changing the scriptures to Gog-Cattle and Magog-Sheep.

　　Muslims in some places taboo the character "pig," so they call pork "Hug Meat." "Hug" is the transliteration of the Persian word Khug, which translates to "meat." What is the benefit of changing the Chinese character for "pig" to the Persian character for "pig"?

　　Yunnan Muslims taboo the character "pig," so because they usually use the character "meat" to represent pork, they changed the names of beef and mutton to "cow vegetables" and "sheep vegetables." They also taboo the character "fat," so they changed the names of "fat cattle" and "fat sheep" to "strong cattle" and "strong sheep." But when the Ahong preaches, he still says: "Cutting off bones and flesh is not allowed," "You should slaughter fat livestock for Qurban." Ordinary Muslims still say: "Children are flesh that falls from their mother's body." A fat Muslim still admits that his feet are too fat and he cannot wear shoes that are too narrow.

　　The era of reactionary rule was an era of Han chauvinism. Han people called themselves the "Great Religion" and called Muslims the "Small Religion," which was obviously a way of looking down on Muslims. Ordinary Muslims, however, acknowledged this name. They added the word "great" to everything related to Han people, for example, calling pork "great meat" (Yunnan Muslims call pork "great vegetables") and calling lard "great oil." Therefore, some Muslims are unwilling for others to call their relatively large oil bottle a "great oil bottle," which is very pointless.

　　In areas where Muslims and Han people live in mixed communities, Han people carrying pork through the streets and alleys where Muslims live must conceal it; otherwise, they will be beaten. People driving herds of pigs through Muslim villages, both pigs and people will suffer unwarranted disasters. Muslim compatriots do not investigate whether he is a local who intentionally jokes with Muslims? Or is he a stranger who does not know the customs of Muslims? Without asking questions and resorting to violence violates the Islamic spirit of peace and tolerance and should be corrected.

　　Finally, I want to tell my Muslim compatriots that pork is not absolutely forbidden, because Islam is pragmatic, and the laws of Islam are not rigid, but flexible. When it comes to escaping disasters, everything can be adapted. Therefore, after each time the Quran prohibits carrion, blood, and pork, it always states: "But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then he is guiltless." (2:173, 6:145), or says: "But if any one is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful." (5:3)

　（五）Summary

　　In this article, I have explained that Muslims do not eat pork because they love cleanliness and pay attention to hygiene, not because of feudal superstition and backward thinking; I have also explained that whether or not to eat pork has nothing to do with ideological progress. In other words, people who eat pork are not necessarily progressive, and people who do not eat pork do not necessarily have ideological problems. However, Muslim cadres who eat pork will definitely be divorced from the Muslim masses. The past and present, unwarranted disputes and estrangement between the Han and Muslim ethnicities caused by pork can only be thoroughly clarified with the weapons of criticism and self-criticism.

　　Since pork is relatively easy to transmit diseases, Han compatriots should also eliminate prejudices and humbly study this issue. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the health departments of various provinces, cities, and counties should pay special attention to the inspection of pork. As for Muslim compatriots, they should also recognize that this is not a simple religious issue, but also an ethnic issue and a political issue. Therefore, Muslims should also eliminate prejudices, study politics, study current events, recognize the environment, recognize the times, and at the same time, they should study religious doctrine, understand the lessons of Islamic peace and tolerance, and promote Muhammad's spirit of serving the people in order to achieve the goal of strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups.

　　回民为什么不吃猪肉
    北京大学教授  马坚
    猪肉是中国人主要的肉食，回民也是中国人，而且在大部分地区与汉民杂居，他们却不吃猪肉。回民为什么不吃猪肉呢？汉民固然不知道，一般回民也说不出什么理由来。“疑思问”，本是人之常情，故汉民常常向回民提出这个问题来。回民不能做圆满的答复，故不愿别人向他们提出这个问题。回民不吃猪肉，已经够奇怪了；不许别人问，更加奇怪，真令人觉得有几分神秘。
    回汉同胞之间，因为这个问题，在反动统治的时代，曾发生了不少的摩擦和纠纷，曾影响了回汉同胞之间的团结和互助。在人民民主专政的时代，这个问题，我认为还有澄清的必要。
  （一）古代各民族对于猪的看法
    古代的埃及人认为猪是污秽的，牧猪的人不得入寺庙。希腊人和罗马人却以猪为赎罪的祭品。除巴比伦人外，闪族人都不吃猪肉。哈兰人（Harranians）平常不吃猪肉，但每年吃一次。
    汉族的祖先是吃猪肉的，但他们祭天地的时候用牛，故牺牲二字从牛。礼记上说：“燔柴于泰坛，祭天也；瘗埋于泰折，祭天也：用騂犊。”（祭法）祭宗庙、山川或衅钟的时候，也大半用牛或用羊，如“告朔之饩羊”，就是明显的例证。他们对于羊的观念是很好的，故“美”、“善”、“义”、“祥”等字，都从羊。他们认为牛羊是比猪高贵的，因此，礼记上说：“天子以牺牛，诸侯以肥牛，大夫以索牛，士以羊豕。”（曲礼）又说：“诸侯无故不杀牛，大夫无故不杀羊，士无故不杀犬豕。”（王制）这大概是由于猪不爱清洁的缘故。易经睽卦：“上九，睽孤，见豕负涂。”程传说：“睽极无所不疑，其见三，如豕之污秽，而又背负泥涂，见其可恶之甚也。”说卦：“坎为豕”。周易大全说：“前后皆阴之污浊，而中心刚躁者，豕也。”李时珍说：“按许氏说文云：‘豕字象毛足而后有尾形。’林氏小说云：‘豕食不洁，故谓之豕。’‘坎为豕’，水畜，而性趋下，喜秽也。”（本草纲目卷五十兽部）猪喜欢吃污秽，故古人把猪关在厕所里，因此，溷字有两个意义：（１）豕所居也（见苍颉篇），（２）厕也（见说文）；厕字也有两个意义：（１）便所也，（２）以养豕溷也。由此可见，在古代的中国，猪通常是豢养在厕所里的，故地位很低。
  （二）现在不吃猪肉的民族
    大家都知道中国回民不吃猪肉，却不知道国内信仰伊斯兰教的各兄弟民族，以及全世界的伊斯兰教徒——包括苏联千百万的伊斯兰教徒——也都不吃猪肉。蒙民同胞大部分是不吃的。印度教徒，也是不吃的。日本人民，在明治维新以后（十九世纪末期），才开始吃猪肉。在马达加斯加岛和坡里尼西亚岛上，猪是禁忌。南非洲班图人的男子不吃猪肉。南非洲组鲁人的女儿们不吃猪肉，因为她们恐怕吃了猪肉之后，相貌会变得像猪那样的难看。南美洲北部的加利比人不吃猪肉，因为他们像大部分的原始民族一样，相信人的体格和性格大半与所吃的食物有密切的关系，所以，他们生怕吃了猪肉之后，眼睛会变得像猪眼那样的渺小。
  （三）伊斯兰教为什么禁止吃猪肉呢？
    伊斯兰教承认人类是世界的主人翁，是代理安拉（上帝）统治世界的，世界万物是供人利用的，供人享受的，故古兰经说：
        “他（指安拉）以你们为大地的代治者。”（六∶一六五）
        “安拉为你们而制服海洋，以便船舶奉他的命令而航行，以便你们寻
        求他的恩惠，以便你们感谢。他为你们而制服天地万物，对于能思维
        的民众，其中确有许多迹象。”（四五∶一二，一三）
        “他已为你们创造大地上的一切事物。”（二∶二九）
    世界万物是供人利用和享受的，故伊斯兰教准许人吃各种合法的、佳美的食物。古兰经说：
    “众人呀！你们可以吃大地上所有合法而且佳美的食物，你们不要随从恶魔的步伐，他确是你们的明敌。”（二∶一六八）
    合法的食物，是以合法的手段取得的食物；佳美的食物，是纯洁的、可口的、富于营养的食物。随从恶魔的步伐，是指蒙昧时代的阿拉伯人因为封建迷信而戒除种种合法而且佳美的食物。
    当日，他们不知道清洁卫生，常吃自死的牛羊骆驼和宰牲时流出的血液，也吃猪肉，故古兰经叙述穆罕默德的任务说：
        “他命令他们行善，禁止他们作恶，准许他们吃佳美的食物，禁戒他
        们吃不洁的食物。”（七∶一五六）
    古兰经指出不洁的食物只有四种：（１）自死物，（２）流血，（３）猪肉，（４）奉偶像之名而宰的动物。
        “他（指安拉）只禁止你们吃自死物、血液、猪肉，以及诵非安拉之
        名而宰的动物。”（二∶一七三）
        “你说：在我所受的启示里，我不能发见任何人所不得吃的食物，除
        非自死物，或流血，或猪肉——因为它确是不洁的——或诵非安拉之
        名而宰的犯罪物。”（六∶一四五）
    为什么禁止吃自死物，血液和诵非安拉之名而宰的动物，因为篇幅所限，不能在本文内加以解释。
    猪是牲畜中最不爱清洁的东西，不像牛羊样选择食物，因此，一般的猪，常害各种疾病，故猪肉是益少害多的。
    古代的中国医学家一致承认猪肉是许多疾病的根源，但他们知其然，而不知其所以然。现代的医学家，借显微镜等科学仪器的帮助，进一步证明了猪肉中的寄生虫是许多疾病的根源。伊斯兰教禁止吃猪肉，正是从清洁卫生着眼的。
  （四）批评和自我批评
    南北各省，回汉杂居；汉民经常吃猪肉，回民却绝对不吃。汉民得不到正确的解释，就想出了种种穿凿附会的说法。
    有些人说：“回教的经典上说：‘勿食诸肉’，回民不识汉字，所以不吃猪肉。”这是佛教徒的观点，是“想当然”的说法。回教的经典是回文的，不是汉文的，怎么会把“诸”字误解作“猪”字呢？
    有些人说：“回民把猪当神灵，所以不敢吃猪肉。清真寺里还供奉着一个铜铸的猪头哩。”这简直是幻想和诬蔑。回教是绝对的一神教，除安拉（Alla）之外，什么都不崇拜，回民怎么会把猪当做神灵呢？
    中国人民革命成功了，全国人民站起来了，我们少数民族在政治上有了平等的地位，在全国各民族的领袖毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导之下，绝没有人敢侮辱我们了。我们自己的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，无论要保持或要改革，我们都有绝对的自由，任何人不得强迫或干涉。这是我们应该感谢毛主席和中国共产党的。
    人民政治协商会议共同纲领的民族政策是完全正确的，是要全部实现的，毫无疑义。但有个别的工作人员，认识不够，不能把握政策，不知道尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，以致部分回民怀疑共同纲领，这是值得我们注意的。
    据我所知，有一部分工作人员，对于不吃猪肉的回民干部和工作人员，加以冷嘲热讽，说他们封建迷信，思想有问题，使他们不能安心工作，甚至为环境所迫，不能不屈服或自动辞职。我认为这是一种左倾的幼稚病，是大汉族主义在下意识里作祟。这对于国内各民族的团结，是极端有害的。就回民干部和工作人员来说，吃了猪肉，思想未必进步；脱离回民群众，却是可以保证的。
    据我看来，吃猪肉与否，并不关乎思想的进步。我们大家都知道马克思和爱因斯坦都是不吃猪肉的犹太人，但马克思发明了辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，爱因斯坦发明了相对论，对于社会科学和自然科学都有划时代的伟大贡献。我们大家也都知道战犯白崇禧是随便吃猪肉的，他的思想却是那样的反动。由此可见，不吃猪肉的人，思想也能进步；吃猪肉的人，思想未必就没有问题。吃不吃猪肉绝对不是衡量思想的标准。
    我们回民同胞对于猪肉问题认识不够，以致有种种不正确的观点和不正当的行为，形成了狭隘的民族主义，这也是应该加以深刻的检讨的。汉民同胞对于我们的种种误会和诬蔑，我们自己应该负一部分责任。
    古兰经上关于戒食猪肉的明文，共计三条（第二章第一七三节，第五章第三节，第六章第一四五节），每条都有猪肉二字，但这两个字并没有染污了古兰经，大家讽诵那三条明文的时候，并没有什么表情。大家说汉语的时候，提到猪肉二字为什么要唾一口，表示厌恶的意思呢？我认为这是一种无谓的举动；在汉民同胞面前作这种表情，是不礼貌的。提到牛肉二字的时候，倘若有人唾一口，你们觉得怎么样呢？
    一般回民都忌讳猪字，因此闹出许多笑话来。
    东南的回民曾参加明太祖朱元璋的农民革命，立了汗马功劳，朱元璋为了奖励他们的勋劳，赐他们姓朱，在专制时代，这是无上的光荣。但现在有人问那些功臣的子孙姓什么的时候，他们觉得很难为情，他们认为朱元璋叫回民姓朱，是一件“缺德”的事情。据说有改姓黑的，不知确实否。
    古兰经上（一八∶九四，二一∶九六）提及古代的两个民族雅朱者和马朱者，有无知的回民，曾提议把经文改为雅牛者和马羊者。
    有些地方的回民，忌讳猪字，把猪肉叫做虎克肉，“虎克”是波斯语Khug的对音，翻译出来，是个肉字。中国的猪字，换成波斯的猪字，究竟有什么好处呢？
    云南回民忌讳猪字，因为通常用“肉”字表示猪肉，故改称牛肉羊肉为牛菜羊菜。他们又忌讳肥字，故改称肥牛肥羊为壮牛壮羊。但阿訇讲经的时候仍然说：“割断骨肉使不得”，“应该宰肥胖的牲灵做古尔邦”。一般回民仍然说：“儿女是母亲身上掉下来的肉。”肥胖的回民，仍然承认他自己的脚太肥，不能穿太瘦的鞋子。
    反动统治时代，是大汉族主义的时代，汉人自称大教，称回民为小教，这显然是轻视回民的意思，一般回民却承认了这个称呼。凡是与汉人有关的东西，他们都加一个大字，例如把猪肉叫做大肉（云南回民把猪肉叫做大菜），把猪油叫做大油。因此，有些回民不愿别人称他的比较大一点的油瓶为大油瓶，这是很无谓的。
    在回民汉民杂居的地区，汉民携带猪肉通过回民居住的大街小巷，必须包藏起来；否则，就会挨打。赶着猪群通过回民村庄的人，猪和人都要遭无妄之灾。回民同胞不调查一下究竟他是有意给回民开玩笑的本地人呢？还是不知道回民风俗习惯的异乡人呢？不问青红皂白，动手打人，违背伊斯兰教和平宽容的精神，是应当改正的。
    最后，我要告诉回民同胞们，猪肉并不是绝对不可以吃，因为伊斯兰教是实事求是的，伊斯兰教的教律不是呆板的，却是灵活的，到了逃灾躲难的时候，一切都可以变通。因此，古兰经每次戒食自死物、血液和猪肉之后，总要说明：“凡为势所迫，非出自愿，且不过分的人，（虽吃禁物），毫无罪过。”（二∶一七三，六∶一四五）或者说：“凡为饥荒所迫，而无意犯罪的，（虽吃禁物，毫无罪过），因为安拉确是至赦的，确是至慈的。”（五∶三）
  （五）总结
    我在本文中说明了回民不吃猪肉是由于爱好清洁，讲究卫生，不是由于封建迷信，思想落后；又说明了吃猪肉与否不关乎思想的进步，换句话说，吃猪肉的人，不一定是进步分子，不吃猪肉的人，思想不一定有问题。但是回民干部吃了猪肉，一定会脱离回民群众。回汉两族之间过去和现在因猪肉而引起的、莫须有的纷争和隔阂，只有用批评和自我批评的武器，才能彻底澄清。
    猪肉既然比较容易传疾病，汉族同胞也就应该化除成见，虚心地把这个问题研究一下。中央人民政府卫生部和各省市县人民政府卫生部门，对于猪肉的检验，应该特别注意。再就回民同胞来说，也应该认识这不是一个单纯的宗教问题，而且是一个民族问题，政治问题。因此，回民也应该化除成见，学习政治，学习时事，认清环境，认清时代，同时，应该学教义，了解伊斯兰教和平宽容的教训，发扬穆罕默德为人民服务的精神，以达到加强各民族团结的目的。
