　　Preliminary Summary of the Promotion of Local Products in Pingyuan Province Over Three Months (Before the Spring Festival)
     The CPC Pingyuan Provincial Committee
  Achievements of the Past Three Months
    I. The promotion of local products last winter was relatively smooth. After the bumper harvest, farmers had many agricultural and sideline local products to sell. Due to the increase in rural purchasing power, the quantity and range of materials needed for exchange and adjustment have expanded compared to the past. In addition, with the restoration of transportation, there is a national market, which provides favorable conditions for the promotion of local products. Not only are industrial products in short supply in rural areas, but also industrial raw materials and export goods have found a market. Moreover, under the strong demand of farmers to actively restore and develop production, many handicraft and sideline products are selling very smoothly. At the Danxian Department Store Fair, willow ware, woodenware, pottery products, and agricultural tools were snapped up within half a day, accounting for 53% of the total transactions. In cotton-producing areas, last year 100 jin of seed cotton could be exchanged for 500 jin of bean cake, but this year it is not easy to get even 400 jin of bean cake. The sweet potato vermicelli in Nanle and Qingfeng used to be unsellable when pushed around the countryside, but now there are carts full of them with designated customers. Even materials that had been reduced or stopped in production for many years during the war, such as Huaishan products in Xinxiang Prefecture, Tianhuafen in Anyang, and peonies in Heze, are being purchased by foreign merchants. These objective conditions have prompted local and foreign merchants to actively restore and establish commercial networks (now there are out-of-town residents in Xinxiang and Anyang cities, and even small towns), improve management, and increase the prices of agricultural and sideline local products (such as homespun cloth, red dates, yams, and peanuts) compared to 1949. In Shou Zhang, the weaving of cattail bags earned only two liang of wheat per bag the year before last, but last winter it earned twelve liang to one jin per bag. Duck down from the lake area exceeded the historical high price.
    Last year, during the Party rectification in Pingyuan Province, the one-sided production viewpoint of neglecting cities and towns and neglecting commerce was criticized. Cadres have recognized the importance of material exchange ideologically, which is also an important condition for the smooth promotion of local products this time. Now, the task before us is to recognize and use the favorable subjective and objective conditions, overcome difficulties (such as the disruption of commercial networks during the war, the lack of communication between regions, the one-sided production viewpoint of some cadres that has not been completely overcome, lack of experience, and unfamiliarity with the work, etc.) to adapt to the production and sales needs of the masses, and make the material exchange work more scaled and organized.
    II. After the Provincial Local Products Conference, the material exchange work was carried out on a province-wide scale. Six prefectures, two cities, and fifty-four counties held local product conferences, with the participation of 10,874 people. Some areas even held meetings by district, region, and industry. In Puyang Prefecture, according to incomplete statistics, about 8,000 people including village cadres, directors of village cooperatives, labor models, private merchants, and handicraft workers participated. Through these meetings, private merchants were widely mobilized and inland material exchanges were organized (according to statistics on ten local products operated by the local product company, private merchants accounted for 55%, and the rest were operated by the local product company, public institutions, and cooperatives). At the same time, the following issues were fundamentally resolved:
    First, the overall production and sales situation of agricultural and sideline local products and handicraft products in the province was initially clarified, laying a basic foundation for the promotion of local products in the future.
    Second, the one-sided production viewpoint of cadres who underestimated commerce was more thoroughly resolved in some areas (but in most areas of the province, especially the ideology of district-level cadres, it has not been completely resolved). The masses in Puyang actively organized exchanges around December 20th last year. They criticized the cadres, saying, "Such meetings should be held more often and earlier." This helped the cadres examine their "half-cut production viewpoint." Some confused ideas, such as "the products are almost the same everywhere, there is nothing to exchange" and "it is causing the masses suffering to engage in transportation and material exchange after the bumper harvest," were also cleared.
    Third, private merchants and firms were widely mobilized. Private merchants were very excited about this, and generally reflected that "their political status has been improved," and that "serving the people by promoting local products is both famous and profitable." They said, "In the past, we thought that the government was only a government of farmers, not a government of merchants, but now it seems that it is truly a government of all classes." Not only have the number of firms increased, but they have also engaged in joint operations, agency purchases, credit purchases, and the use of foreign capital to actively restore old commercial relationships. After ten oil mills in Qingping County formed a joint venture, they went to Taiyuan and Shou Zhang areas to purchase raw materials. Four oil mills in Wuzhi jointly opened up sales channels in Hankou and Guangzhou. The homespun cloth shops in Meng County unified purchases and jointly went to Jincheng to promote sales. After the water tobacco leaves in Wuzhi and the warehouses in Heze established contacts with Shanghai, Jinan, Zhoucun, and other places, foreign merchants often remitted money to order goods. Warehouses in various places actively solicited customers, went to the countryside to investigate purchases, and inquired with the government about market conditions and goods that needed to be promoted. Some private merchants used to complain about "heavy taxes," "poor collection methods," and "financial difficulties," etc., but after profiting from operating local products, their emotions changed greatly. The dried fruit warehouses in Anyang City took the initiative to entertain cadres and report the situation, believing that "listening to the government is profitable" and getting closer to the government.
    Fourth, large-scale inland material exchanges were organized between villages, districts, and counties. According to incomplete statistics during this period, as many as 1,690 various contracts have been signed. Cadres have initially learned some methods of organizing material exchanges and laid the foundation for further development of the contract system.
    Through the above work, by the end of last year, 73.6% of the province's 85 kinds of local products had been sold (with a total value of 815,000,888 jin converted into rice).
  Main Experience
    III. Main experience:
    1. It is necessary to hold local product conferences with the participation of private merchant representatives. The leading organs should attach great importance to the meetings. All financial and economic departments should be fully prepared for this. It is necessary to clarify the situation, sign agreements or contracts, and specifically solve the sales channels. Avoid the tendency of only administrative cadres participating in the local product conference and empty talk about policies and guidelines (the one held in Huxi was not good, only the heads of the county government and the commissioner's office industry and commerce section participated, and few specific problems were solved).
    2. Give full play to the role of firms and warehouses. The characteristics of agricultural and sideline local products are that they are diverse in type, huge in quantity, and scattered in production. They must be gradually concentrated multiple times before large-scale promotion and exchange can be carried out.
    There are many ways to solve this problem. Recently, regional exchanges organized by county, district, and village cooperatives in various places are much more planned than market transactions and avoid intermediate exploitation.
    In addition, organizing department store fairs and temple fairs according to seasonal needs and mobilizing peddlers to go to the countryside to exchange and purchase goods are all forms that the masses are accustomed to and welcome.
    However, the main permanent and fixed institutions that concentrate products, organize exchanges, and open up sales channels in the market are still firms and warehouses. After the Provincial Local Products Conference, with the planned support of the leadership, according to incomplete statistics, 173 new firms and warehouses have been added (there are now 500 firms and warehouses in the province), which have played a huge role in promoting local products, restoring commercial networks, and opening up sales channels.
    Because it connects production and sales and is familiar with buying and selling, it can attract customers, widely restore commercial networks, and mobilize foreign merchants to purchase goods on the one hand. On the other hand, it can widely organize farmers to sell through the market and existing relationships. After Anyang City organized firms and mobilized date merchants from Beijing, Tianjin, and Northeast China to purchase goods, it sold more than 5 million jin of Neihuang red dates in less than a month, and the daily market volume broke historical records. Therefore, planned development of a sufficient number of firms and warehouses and giving play to their characteristics as intermediaries should be an important way to continue to promote agricultural and sideline local products in the future.
    3. Local private merchants, firms, and handicraft workers generally reflect that there is a lack of funds, which affects long-distance purchases and sales. Firms and warehouses can only sit and wait for transactions to earn handling fees, and lack the ability to take advantage of trade opportunities. Therefore, there are still phenomena of no goods for customers when they arrive, stagnant sales after customers leave, and drastic price increases and decreases.
    Various places have made creations in solving this problem. The solutions are:
    First, organize joint operations, raise shares, unify purchases, and promote sales in distant places. This is a good trend that is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. It makes it easier for private merchants to concentrate their forces, open up sales channels, reduce costs, and increase profits. It is also easier to stabilize market prices and for the country to manage and support them.
    Second, use foreign capital and remit money to order goods. The firms and warehouses in Heze and Xinxiang prefectures have both pre-borrowed funds from foreign merchants or had foreign merchants remit money to order local products, which is beneficial to solving the problem of financial difficulties and mastering normal prices.
    Third, purchase farmers' products on credit and absorb idle funds. For example, Tongxing Oil Mill in Heze purchases beans from farmers on credit and repays them with bean cake. Now the price of bean cake is 46,000 yuan per 100 jin, 43,000 yuan for bean cake taken in the spring, and 41,000 yuan for bean cake taken after the wheat harvest, which increases capital turnover.
    Fourth, the state bank provides loans and acceptance to support them. In Xinxiang City alone, the acceptance business reached 39,170,000 yuan. From September to December, loans for local products in 15 towns and cities including Xinxiang and Anyang amounted to 34.17776 billion yuan.
    But the above is only the beginning.
    4. Last winter, local product companies and cooperatives played a certain leading role in organizing the promotion of agricultural and sideline local products.
    Local product companies focused on purchasing some export products (such as black dates, grass braid, Huaishan products, and peach kernels). They also made efforts to control prices in some areas. For products without fixed purchase tasks, they appropriately carried out buying and selling. For products with purchase tasks (such as grass braid), they jointly negotiated prices with private merchants. They partially organized chain businesses between the public and private sectors (such as Anyang Salt Industry and Grease Company signing a barter contract to exchange salt for cotton seeds, which solved the supply and sales needs of the masses), which had a good effect on uniting private merchants, correctly implementing price policies, strengthening the cooperation of various companies, and organizing the normal circulation of products.
    Many county and district cooperatives organized large-scale inland exchanges, developed many contracts, and had various forms (including exchange, ordering, prepayment, turnover, consignment, agency purchase, contracting, etc.), and the impact spread to state-owned, cooperative, private merchants, and farmers. This not only reduced the blindness of production and sales, changed the phenomenon of handicrafts not being produced in the off-season and not enough sales in the peak season, shortened the commodity circulation process, and overcame financial difficulties, but also began to organize inland exchanges in an organized manner. After this local product promotion, the prestige of cooperatives in Huixian, Linxian, and Guancheng and other places has greatly improved.
  Current Situation and Problems
    IV. Current situation and problems to be solved:
    1. There are roughly three situations for agricultural and sideline local products that have not been sold:
    First, due to the blockade by American imperialism, exports are difficult. For example, weasel skins and lambskins used to be 50,000 yuan per piece, but now they are only 8,000 yuan, and no one buys them. There is also no market for fine grass braid.
    Second, the peak sales season has not yet arrived (such as Huaishan products), or farmers are waiting for seasonal price differences based on historical experience (such as Neihuang red dates and Liaocheng black dates). It is said that after the third month of the lunar calendar, they can still sell well, so some wealthy farmers are still waiting for higher prices.
    Third, because commercial relations have not been fully restored (such as Puyang homespun cloth, which historically sold in southern Shanxi, but the relationship has been interrupted after the war, and many purchasing firms no longer exist), the product specifications are poor (such as hawthorn slices, merchants need to cut four or six slices, while farmers only cut two slices), or our supply work cannot keep up, and farmers are waiting and watching (such as cotton stored by farmers in Qingping and Gaotang, and red dates stored by some farmers in Neihuang, partly because industrial product prices are too high, coal once rose to 400 yuan to 560 yuan per jin, and the supply is not keeping up. Farmers say, "As long as there is bean cake and coal, we can exchange for anything").
    It is necessary to seriously deal with them according to sales channels and seasons (some should be educated to stop production and change jobs, such as weasel skins and fine grass braid. Some should improve specifications. Some need to strengthen supply and organize barter and credit purchases. Some need to actively open up domestic market sales channels. Some also need to seriously understand the seasonal situation; neither force farmers to sell, nor blindly wait for seasonal price differences). For this reason, it is necessary to continue to solve the problem of cadres neglecting trade work and implement material exchange work throughout the year. At present, most cadres have not established a complete production view, and at the same time, they have a sense of complacency, thinking that "prices will rise after the new year, and they can be sold without leadership" and "without inventory, sales will not be a problem." These ideas are harmful. After the peak sales season from autumn to the end of the year has passed, there are still many products with peak sales seasons after the new year, and many handicraft and sideline productions are determined at any time according to sales (agricultural and sideline local products are determined according to the previous year's sales to determine the production of the following year), and without inventory, sales are not necessarily smooth.
    2. After the local products are sold, farmers' needs for means of production and daily necessities are even more urgent. On the one hand, to expand the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, it is necessary to strengthen the work of various trading companies. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop handicraft and sideline production to solve the difficulties of agricultural tools, wood goods, fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and bricks and tiles. This is of greater significance when farmers begin to have surplus grain and labor.
    The leadership of the spring temple fair should be strengthened in a planned way. According to the specifications and styles favored by farmers in various places, widely sign processing and ordering contracts.
    3. According to the state's price policy and sales situation, widely carry out pre-purchase contracts (such as cotton, tobacco, etc.) to effectively guide farmers' spring production.
    4. From the perspective of the whole province, the fact that the business of state-owned companies and cooperatives cannot keep up with objective needs is a serious problem.
    First, local product companies are still unable to have appropriate buying and selling power for the main agricultural and sideline local products that need to be exported throughout the province. Therefore, the phenomenon of drastic increases and decreases in various places is constantly repeated. Generally, when foreign merchants come, they are eager to purchase, and prices rise. Subsequently, farmers and vendors "raise prices together," "refuse to sell if they are not paid three times the price," and the quality and specifications of products are reduced. Once foreign merchants leave, although there are sales channels, they are stagnant due to lack of purchase.
    To solve this problem, in addition to appropriately persuading farmers, agreeing on appropriate prices with foreign merchants, and organizing firms and warehouses to sign regular purchase contracts with foreign merchants as much as possible, the key lies in strengthening the work of local product companies. Facts have proved that as long as various economic forces are well combined for local products with certain regional characteristics in both production and sales, prices can be correctly controlled without a lot of funds. The current situation is: first, there are too few local product company organizations; second, the management ability to understand the situation is not as good as that of private merchants, and they cannot truly understand the production and sales situation, peak and off seasons, regional and seasonal price differences. If this passive situation is not changed, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of organizing the normal circulation of products and leading and uniting private merchants.
    Second, county and district cooperatives in various places have made great achievements in organizing domestic sales. However, on the one hand, many contracts lack inspection after signing, and some contracts have no specifications, conditions, or intermediaries, or even if they do, they are not specific; and some contracts are not strictly observed in good faith after signing. On the other hand, there are more exchange contracts for domestic sales and fewer contracts for export, prepayment, credit purchase, and chain sales. Therefore, it is still weak to guide production in a planned way through contracts. Many county and district cooperatives only act as intermediaries for village cooperative exchanges; they do a poor job of promoting and supplying materials that cannot be solved by districts and villages through their own business operations. Some cooperative cadres have the wrong idea that operating local products is more troublesome than industrial products and the profits are not great. At the same time, they also lack understanding of the difference between rural supply and marketing cooperatives and urban consumer cooperatives. For example, Qinyang County Cooperative plans 1.7 billion funds in the first quarter, with 1.3 billion to supply members with living materials, and the remaining 400 million is not determined for promoting local products. Some cooperatives in Liaocheng Prefecture "do not operate cotton in cotton-producing areas and do not operate grain in grain-producing areas." The masses in Puyang reflected that cooperatives "supply more and sell less," and did not regard the promotion of members' agricultural and sideline local products as a major task. We believe that supplying members with cheap living materials, implementing the central allocation plan, and expanding the exchange of industrial and agricultural products is necessary, but it is necessary to see that members are more eager to have their local products sold.
    Third, the main reason for the above shortcomings is that the work and organization of the financial and economic committees at all levels are not sound; many prefectural and county financial and economic committees are busy with the approval of individual local finances and do not focus their main energy on organizing people's economic life. Therefore, according to the instructions of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, it is very important to strengthen leadership, enrich the organization, and try out county financial and economic offices.
    Solving the above problems will enable the work of promoting local products and organizing material exchanges to develop more smoothly.

　　平原省三个月来（春节前）推销土产工作的初步总结
     中共平原省委员会
  三个月来的成绩
    一、去冬土产推销进行是比较顺利的。丰收后，农民有许多农副业土产品要求推销。由于农村购买力提高，需要交换调剂物资的数量、种类范围比前扩大，加以交通恢复，有了全国市场，推销土产品有了有利条件。不仅工业品在农村中供不应求，工业原料，出口物资有了销路，而且在农民积极恢复与发展生产的强烈要求下，许多手工业、副业产品销路都极顺畅。单县百货大会，柳条货、木器、窑业产品、农具，上市半日抢购一空，占成交量的百分之五十三。在产棉区，去年百斤籽棉换五百斤豆饼，今年换四百斤饼都不易到手。南乐、清丰的红薯粉条，过去推车游乡卖不掉，现有成车的定户。甚至战争中多年减产停产的物资，像新乡专区的怀货，安阳的天花粉，菏泽的牡丹，都有外商收购。这些客观情况，就推动了本地与外地商人为适应农村供销需要，而积极恢复与建立商业网（现在新乡、安阳两市甚至小城镇，都有外埠住客），改善经营，并使农副业土产品的价格（如土布、红枣、山药、花生等），都比一九四九年有所提高。寿张蒲包编织，前年一个只赚麦二两，去冬一个赚到十二两至一斤。湖产鸭绒超过历史上高价。
    去年平原省整党中，对忽视城镇、忽视商业的片面生产观点，曾加以批判，干部思想上已认识物资交流的重要，也是这次能顺利推销土产的重要条件。现在，摆在我们面前的任务是：认识和运用主观和客观的有利条件，克服困难（如战争中商业网被打乱、地区间相互不透气、若干干部的片面生产观点还未完全克服，经验缺乏，工作生疏等。）以适应群众的产销需要，使物资交流工作更具规模、更有组织。
    二、省土产会议后，物资交流工作以全省规模开展。六个专区，两个市，五十四县都开了土产会议，参加者一万零八百七十四人。有些地区更分区、分片、分行业召开了会议。在濮阳专区，据不完全统计约有村干部、村合作社主任、劳动模范、私商、手工业者共八千人参加。通过这些会议，广泛地发动了私商和组织了内地的物资交流（据土产公司所经营的十项土产统计，私商即占百分之五十五，其余为土产公司、公营机关与合作社经营），同时从根本上解决了以下问题：
    第一、初步弄清了全省农副业土产品及手工业产品全面产销情况，给今后推销土产作好一个基本工作。
    第二、干部轻视商业的片面生产观点，在部分地区解决的比较彻底。（但在全省大部地区，特别是区级干部的思想还解决得不彻底）濮阳群众在去年腊月二十日左右，还积极组织交换。他们批评干部说：“这样的会应该多开早开。”这就帮助干部检查了自己的“半截生产观点”。一些所谓“各地产品差不多，没有什么可以交换”、“丰收了再搞运输，物资交流是叫群众受罪”的糊涂思想，也得到清算。
    第三、广泛地发动了私商行栈。私商对此很兴奋，普遍反映“政治地位提高了”，“推销土产为人民服务，有名有利”；他们说“过去认为政府只是农民政府，不是商人政府，现在看来真正是各阶层的政府”。不仅行栈有增加，而且进行联营、代购、赊购、运用外资，积极恢复旧商业关系的活动。清平县十户油坊，联营后到太原、寿张地区收购原料；武陟四家油坊，联合打开了汉口、广州的销路；孟县土布行，统一收购，联合到晋城去推销；武陟水烟叶，菏泽的货栈与上海、济南、周村等地建立联系后，经常有外商汇款定货。各地行栈，都主动招揽顾客，下乡考察收购，向政府打听行情和需要推销的货物，过去有些私商反映：“税收重”，“征收方式不好”以及“资金困难”等，但经营土产获利后，情绪大变。安阳市干果行栈，主动招待干部，报告情况，认为“听政府的话，就有利可图”，更靠近了政府一步。
    第四、村、区、县之间大规模的组织了内地的物资交流。据这一时期的不完全统计，已订立各种合同达一六九○件之多，干部初步学会组织物资交流的一些方法，并为进一步开展合同制打下基础。
    经过以上工作，至去年年底止，全省八十五种土产品，已推销出百分之七十三点六（折米总值八一五、○○○、八八八斤）。
  主要经验
    三、主要经验：
    １、必须开好有私商代表参加的土产会议。领导机关对会议应十分重视。各个财经部门对此应有充分准备。必须作到弄清情况，订立协议或合同，具体解决推销门路。避免只有行政干部参加土产会议，空讲方针政策的偏向（湖西开的不好，只有县政府、专员公署工商科长参加，很少解决具体问题）。
    ２、充分发挥行栈作用。农副业土产品的特点，是种类繁杂，数量庞大，产品分散，必须多次的逐步的集中起来，才能进行较大规模的推销与交换。
    解决的办法很多，最近各地由县、区、村合作社所组织的地区交换，就远较市场交易有计划的多，并且避免了中间剥削。
    另外，根据季节需要有计划的组织百货大会和庙会，发动担挑小贩下乡换购收购，都是为群众所习惯所欢迎的形式。
    但是，在市场上作为集中产品，组织交流，打开销路的经常固定机构，主要还是行栈、货栈。省土产会议后，在领导上有计划的扶植下，根据不完全统计，已增加行栈一七三家（现在全省共有行栈五百家），对推销土产，恢复商业网，打开销路，起了巨大的作用。
    因为它连系产销，熟悉买卖，通过它一方面可以招揽顾客，广泛恢复商业网，发动外商收购。另方面，又可以经过市场及旧有关系广泛组织农民出售。安阳市组织行栈，动员北京、天津、东北等地枣商来收购以后，不及一月推销了内黄红枣五百余万斤，每日上市量，打破历史纪录。因此，今后有计划地发展足够数量的行栈，发挥其中介人的特点，应是继续推销农副业土产品的一项重要办法。
    ３、本地私商、行栈和手工业者，普遍反映是资金缺乏，影响远地购买与推销，行栈也只能坐等成交吃手续费，缺乏吞吐能力，因而仍发生客来无货，客走滞销，价格暴涨暴跌现象。
    各地在解决这一问题中都有创造，其办法：
    第一、组织联营，集股，统一收购，远地推销，这是公私两便的良好趋向，既便私商能够集中力量，打开销路，减低成本，增加利润；也便于稳定市场价格，和国家的管理扶植。
    第二、运用外资，汇款定货。菏泽、新乡专区的行栈，都有预借外商资金，或由外商汇款定购土产者，对解决资金困难，掌握正常的价格，都有好处。
    第三、赊购农民产品，吸收游资。如菏泽同兴油坊向农民赊豆还饼，现在给饼每百斤四万六千元，春天取饼四万三千元，麦收后取饼四万一，增加了资金周转。
    第四、国家银行，办理贷款及押汇，予以扶植。新乡市一地办理押汇业务即达三九一、七○○万元。新乡、安阳二市等十五个城镇，统计九月至十二月扶植土产贷款达三百四十一亿七千七百六十万元。
    但以上仅是开端。
    ４、去冬土产公司和合作社，都对组织农副业土产品的推销，起了一定的领导作用。
    土产公司有重点地收购了一部外销产品（如乌枣、草帽辫、怀货、桃仁），在掌握物价上，部分地区也作了努力。如对没有固定收购任务的产品，适当地进行了吞吐，有收购任务的产品（如草帽辫），与私商进行了共同议价，公私之间部分的组织了连环业务（如安阳盐业与油脂公司订立换购合同，以盐换棉籽，解决了群众供给与推销两方面要求），都对团结私商，正确实行价格政策，加强各公司的配合，组织产品正常流通，收到良好的效果。
    许多县、区合作社，组织了规模巨大的内地交流，发展的合同很多，形式也是多种多样（包括交换、定货、预购、周转、代销、代购、包工等），且影响普及到国营、合作、私商、农民各方面，不仅减少了产销盲目性，改变了手工业淡月不生产，旺月不够销的现象；缩短了商品流通过程，克服了资金困难，也是有组织进行内地交流的开始。辉县、林县、观城等地合作社，经过这次土产推销，威信大有提高。
  目前情况与问题
    四、目前的情况和需要解决的问题：
    １、现在没有推销出去的农副业土产品，大致有三种情况：
    第一、由于美帝国主义封锁，出口困难。如猾子皮、羔皮，过去五万元一张，现仅八千元，亦无人收购，细草帽辫亦无销路。
    第二、销售的旺季还没有到来（如怀货），或者农民根据历史经验等待季节差价（如内黄红枣，聊城的乌枣）。据说旧历三月以后，还可畅销，因而一部分殷实农民，还等着高价。
    第三、由于商业关系还没有完全恢复（如濮阳土布，历史上销于晋南，战争后关系中断，收购行栈多不存在），产品规格差（如山楂片，商人需切四刀六刀片，而农民只切两刀），或者我们供应工作跟不上，农民观望不出售者（如清平、高唐农民存棉，内黄部分农民存有红枣，部分原因是工业品价格过高，煤炭一斤曾涨至四百元到五百六十元，供应不上，农民说：“只要有豆饼、煤炭换什么都可以”。）
    必须认真根据销路和季节分别对待（有的应教育农民停产转业，如猾子皮、细草帽辫。有的应提高规格。有的需要加强供应，组织换购赊购。有的需要积极打开国内市场的销路。也有的需要认真了解季节情况；既不勉强叫农民出售，也不盲目地等待季节差价）。为此，必须继续解决干部忽视贸易工作的思想，把物资交流工作贯彻全年。目前大部分干部完整的生产观点，还没有树立起来，同时又有自满情绪，认为“年后一涨价，不领导也可推销出去”“没有了存货，销路就不成问题”，这些思想是有害的。秋后到年关，最大的旺销季节过去后，还有不少产品旺销季节是在年后，而许多手工业副业生产，又是随时根据销路决定的（农副业土产品则是根据上年销路决定来年生产），没有存货并不一定销路顺畅。
    ２、土产推销出去以后，农民对生产资料、日用品的需要更为迫切。一方面扩大工农业品的交换，须加强各贸易公司的工作，另方面须发展手工业、副业生产，解决农具、木货、肥料、种籽、农药、砖瓦的困难。在农民开始有剩余粮食和劳力的情况下，更有重大意义。
    应有计划地加强春季庙会的领导。根据各地农民所喜用的规格样式，广泛订立加工订货合同。
    ３、应根据国家的价格政策，销路情况，广泛开展预购合同（如棉花、烟叶等），以有力地指导农民的春季生产。
    ４、从全省来看，国营公司、合作社的业务跟不上客观的需要，是一个严重问题。
    第一、土产公司还不能够对全省需要外销的主要农副业土产品，具有适当的吞吐力量，因而各地仍不断重复着暴涨暴跌的现象。一般是外商来后，急于收购，价格上涨；随之而来的是农民小贩“齐行提价”“一赶三不卖”“有行无市”产品质量规格降低，外商一走，销路虽有也因无人收购而陷于滞销。
    解决这一问题，除对农民进行适当地说服，与外商议定适当的价格，并尽可能组织行栈与外商订立经常收购合同以外，关键在于加强土产公司的工作。事实证明，产销都有一定地区性的土产，只要各种经济力量结合的好，不需要很多资金就可以正确地掌握价格政策。目前情况：一是土产公司机构太少；二是经营能力了解情况上不如私商，不能真实地了解生产销路的情况，淡旺季节，地区和季节差价。这一被动局面，如不改变，很难达到组织产品的正常流通与领导团结私商的目的。
    第二、各地县、区合作社，在组织内销有很大成绩。但是，一方面许多合同订立后还缺乏检查，有些合同没有规格、条件、中人，或者有亦不具体；也有些订了合同，还不能严格遵守信用。另方面，是内销的交换的合同较多，外销的以及预购、赊购、连销合同较少。因此，通过合同有计划地指导生产，还显得无力。许多县、区合作社，只是作了村合作社交换的中介人；透过自己的业务经营，推销与供给区村所解决不了的物资，还做的很差。一部分合作社干部，有怕经营土产比工业品麻烦，利不大的错误思想，同时对农村供销社与城市消费社的差别亦认识不足。如沁阳县合作社第一季计划十七亿资金，以十三亿供给社员生活资料，其余四亿亦未确定作推销土产。聊城专区有的合作社“产棉区不经营棉花，产粮区不经营粮食”。濮阳群众反映合作社“供给多，推销少”，没有把推销社员的农副业土产品当作重大任务。我们认为供给社员以廉价的生活资料，贯彻中央配售计划，扩大工农业品的交换是须要的，但须看到社员更迫切的是要求把土产品推销出去。
    第三、产生以上缺点的主要原因，是各级财政经济委员会工作和机构不健全；许多专区、县财政经济委员会忙于个别地方财政的批办，而没有把主要精力放在组织人民的经济生活上去。因此，按照中共中央华北局指示，加强领导，充实机构，试办县财经办公室，甚感重要。
    解决以上问题，才能使推销土产组织物资交流工作，更顺利地开展下去。
