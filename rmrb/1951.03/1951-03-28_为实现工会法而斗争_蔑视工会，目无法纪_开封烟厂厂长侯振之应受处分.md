Struggle to Implement the Trade Union Law
Disregarding the Trade Union and Disregarding the Law
Hou Zhenzhi, Director of Kaifeng Cigarette Factory, Should Be Disciplined

To the Editors:

The Kaifeng Cigarette Factory was established by the Kaifeng Public Security Bureau in Henan Province to solve the livelihood of some labor service teams. It started operation on March 9, 1950. Over the past year, with the efforts of the administration and the workers, the factory's business has developed to a certain extent, but there are still serious violations of the Trade Union Law in the administrative leadership:

I. Director Hou Zhenzhi has consistently adopted an erroneous attitude towards trade union organizations and trade union work. For example, when the trade union was established in August last year, the director said: "If your trade union is established, my factory will not operate, and you can all go home!" Last year, during the National Day, all notices issued by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to the factory's trade union were withheld by the director. The director also told the guards at the gate: "If people from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions come, they cannot enter the factory without my approval." In November last year, the trade union, representing the opinions of the workers, requested that the wage for wrapping cigarettes be adjusted from 6.4 jin of flour per thousand packs to 10 jin of wheat. The administration insisted on not agreeing and said: "Whoever thinks it's too little can leave, there are plenty of unemployed workers." Later, when the workers went to request it themselves, the director agreed, deliberately using this to undermine the trade union's prestige.

II. Arbitrarily dismissing workers. In September last year, when the factory's production was relatively good, the administration hired more than 20 female workers without notifying the trade union. In November, when business turned bad, the director dismissed 15 female workers without notifying the trade union or obtaining the approval of the Labor Bureau. The director told the old workers: "Those who are dismissed are the new workers," and told the new workers: "The old workers told you to leave," which affected the unity of the workers. In December of the same year, the factory, using the excuse that "the factory's funds are not turning over and the factory cannot start work," prepared to dismiss five male workers without the consent of the trade union or the approval of the Labor Bureau. However, after investigation by the trade union, the factory was not losing money but making money. When the trade union protested, the director ignored it; mediation by the Labor Bureau was also ineffective. As a result, four workers were dismissed, including the trade union's labor protection committee member, Shu Hongru. When the factory recruits female packaging workers, it requires them to write a guarantee before entering the factory: "Regardless of any difficulties, if dismissed, no dismissal compensation will be required."

III. Wage and working hours issues. The factory produces for 12 hours a day. After work, some workers have to do the work of spraying tobacco shreds, and the actual working hours are 13 to 14 hours. No overtime pay is given for night shifts. The factory refuses to implement the decision of the Second Kaifeng Municipal People's Congress that "the working hours of factories and enterprises should be 8 hours in principle, with a maximum of no more than 10 hours." Li Wenmin, the trade union's cultural and educational committee member, went to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for a meeting in December last year, and did not exceed two working days for the whole month. The administration considered it piecework and did not pay wages. The factory refused to pay female workers holiday wages for National Day last year. Later, after receiving a notice from the Municipal Labor Bureau to pay the wages, the director tore up the notice. The issue was only resolved after several negotiations by the trade union.

IV. The factory's administration refuses to pay trade union dues. Even after being criticized by the Henan Daily, he brazenly said: "Unless it is criticized in the People's Daily and Chairman Mao sees it, I will pay." After repeated negotiations by the trade union, it was only paid in November last year. The trade union's housing and necessary equipment have not been allocated to this day.

Because the director does not attach importance to trade union work, the trade union work in the factory is difficult to carry out, its prestige among the staff is not high, and it has not done enough in organizing and educating the staff to establish a new labor attitude and abide by discipline, let alone fight against bureaucracy with the attitude of masters. The trade union chairman and committee members are passive and unwilling to do anything. The trade union has failed to play its due role.

The Kaifeng Cigarette Factory's business has developed over the past year, the quality of the finished products is good, and the sales are wide. The main problems are poor administrative management, bureaucracy, chaotic system, corruption, etc., which make the problems entangled and finally lead to a temporary shutdown on the pretext of "closing accounts." We hope that the relevant departments can inspect the factory, rectify the factory management committee, strengthen trade union work, and educate the factory director to recognize his mistakes, conduct a public self-criticism, and earnestly implement the Trade Union Law in future work.

Editor's note: Hou Zhenzhi, director of the Kaifeng Cigarette Factory, has completely lost the position of the working class. The relevant leading organs should give him appropriate education and punishment; and accept the readers' opinions and inspect the factory's work. Only in this way can the workers of the factory realize that they are the masters of the country and the factory; can the workers' class consciousness be raised and the trade union work be promoted.

### 为实现工会法而斗争  蔑视工会，目无法纪   开封烟厂厂长侯振之应受处分

　　为实现工会法而斗争
    蔑视工会，目无法纪
    开封烟厂厂长侯振之应受处分编辑同志：
    开封烟厂是河南省开封市公安局为解决部分劳役队的生活而开办的。于一九五○年三月九日开工。一年来在行政和工人的努力下，该厂营业获得了一定的发展，但在行政领导上还严重地存在违犯工会法的情形：
    一、厂长侯振之对于工会组织和工会工作一贯采取错误的态度。如去年八月该厂成立工会时，厂长说：“你们工会成立了，我的厂子不干了，你们都回家！”去年国庆节时，市总工会发给该厂工会的各项通知均被厂长扣押。厂长并且告诉门口的警卫班说：“市工会来人，我不批准就不能进厂。”去年十一月，工会代表工人意见，要求将包烟工资由每千包六斤四两面调整到十斤麦子。行政坚持不答应，并说：“谁嫌少谁走，有的是失业工人。”后来工人自己去要求，厂长便答应了，故意借此打击工会威信。
    二、随便解雇工人。去年九月该厂生产情况较好时，行政方面未通知工会，即自行添雇了二十多个女工。到十一月营业转坏，厂长不通知工会也未经劳动局批准，即解雇了十五个女工。厂长对老工人说：“解雇的是新工人”，又对新工人说：“老工人叫你们走”，影响了工人的团结。同年十二月，厂方又借口“厂内资金周转不开，工厂不能开工”，既未经工会同意，和劳动局批准，又准备解雇五名男工。但经工会调查，工厂不但不赔钱而且赚了钱。当工会提出抗议，厂长根本不理；经劳动局调解也无效。结果四名工人被解雇，其中有工会的劳动保护委员束宏儒。该厂在招收包装女工时，进厂前要女工写保证书：“无论任何困难时被解雇，不得要解雇金”。
    三、工资和工时的问题。该厂每日生产十二小时，下班后，部分工人还得做喷烟丝的活，实际工作时间达十三、四小时。加夜班不给加班费。开封市二届各界人民代表会对“工厂企业工时以八小时为原则最多不超过十小时”的决定，该厂拒不执行。该厂工会文教委员李文敏去年十二月份去市总工会开会，全月并未超过二个工作日。行政认为是计件工，便不发工资。去年国庆节的假期工资，该厂拒不发给女工。后来接到市劳动局补发该项工资的通知，厂长便把通知撕了，后经工会几次交涉，问题才解决。
    四、该厂行政抗交工会经费，虽经河南日报批评后，他还悍然地说：“除非人民日报上批评，毛主席看了我才交。”经过工会一再交涉，才于去年十一月补交，工会房子及必要设备，至今也不拨给。
    由于厂长这样不重视工会工作，该厂工会工作很难展开，在职工中威信不高，在组织教育职工树立新的劳动态度与遵守纪律方面也作得不够，更没有以主人翁的态度向官僚主义进行斗争。工会主席和各委员消极不愿干，工会未能起到应有的作用。
    开封烟厂一年来营业是发展的，成品质量好，销路也广。主要问题是行政经营不善，官僚主义，制度混乱，贪污腐化等；使问题纠缠不清，终于在日前借口“结账”暂时停工。我们希望有关部门能对该厂进行检查，整顿工厂管理委员会，加强工会工作，并教育该厂厂长认识错误，公开进行检讨，在今后工作中认真执行工会法。

    编者按：开封烟厂厂长侯振之完全丧失了工人阶级的立场，有关领导机关应该给予他适当的教育和处分；并接受读者意见，检查该厂工作。只有这样，才能使该厂工人体会到自己是国家和工厂的主人；才能提高工人的阶级觉悟、推动工会工作前进。
