Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 1st: According to a Telepress dispatch from New York, the movement responding to the nationwide appeal to petition for peace in Washington has now developed extensively. The American "National Peace Crusade Committee," which is in charge of this petition movement, has decided to extend the date from the original March 1st to March 15th, so that all those who wish to participate can do so.

The Crusade Committee was founded in early February by sixty-five prominent Americans. The number of initiators has now exceeded one hundred. The Crusade Committee reports that thousands upon thousands of individuals and groups across the country who wish to participate in the petition have submitted requests. In New York City alone, 1,500 people are willing to participate in the petition.

The peace petition delegation will express to Congress and Truman the will of all the American people (regardless of religion, race, occupation, or political belief) demanding peace.

The youth department of the Crusade Committee will send a large-scale delegation. Many delegations, especially those of veterans and labor unions, have already made plans to spend an extra day in Washington, specifically to present peace demands to representatives and senators.

The groups participating in the petition will include: the Women's Peace Committee, the Black People's Committee for the Defense of Peace and Unity, the New York Labor Peace Congress Committee, and the New York Veterans League.

The Crusade Committee has also launched a nationwide peace vote campaign, distributing hundreds of thousands of ballots that ask: "Do you support withdrawing our troops from Korea and living in peace with China?" The results of the vote will be taken to Washington by the petition delegation.

    【新华社一日讯】据电通社纽约讯，由于响应全国赴华盛顿和平请愿号召的运动现在已有广泛的发展，主持这一请愿运动的美国“全国和平十字军委员会”已决定把日期从原定的三月一日延展至三月十五日，以使所有希望参加的人得以参加。
    十字军委员会系由六十五位著名美国人士于二月初创立。现在发起人数已在一百位以上了。十字军委员会报告称，全国已有成千成百希望参加请愿的个人和团体提出了请求。仅在纽约一市，便有一千五百人愿意参加请愿。
    和平请愿队伍将向国会和杜鲁门表示全体美国人民（不分宗教、肤色、职业、政治信仰）要求和平的意志。
    十字军委员会的青年部将派出大规模的代表团。许多代表团，特别是退伍军人和工会的代表团，都已经制订计划，准备在华盛顿特别停留一天，专向众议员及参议员提出和平要求。
    参加请愿的团体将有：妇女和平委员会、黑人保卫和平统一委员会、纽约劳工和平大会委员会、纽约退伍军人联盟。
    十字军委员会并发动了一次全国规模的和平投票运动，散发了数十万张票，上面问道：“你赞成把我们的军队从朝鲜撤回并和中国和平相处吗？”投票结果将由请愿代表团带往华盛顿。
