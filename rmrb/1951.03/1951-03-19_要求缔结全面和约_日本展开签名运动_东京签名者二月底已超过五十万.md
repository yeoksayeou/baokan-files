　　Demanding the Conclusion of an Overall Peace Treaty
    Japan Launches Signature Campaign
    Number of Signatures in Tokyo Exceeds 500,000 by the End of February
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 18th] A Tokyo dispatch from TASS on the 17th reports: A signature campaign demanding the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and opposing the rearmament of Japan is being enthusiastically launched in Japan.

    As of March 7th, Kyoto Prefecture had collected 300,000 signatures. Forty-four different groups actively participated in this movement, including labor unions, student groups, and religious organizations. Kyoto Prefecture recently held fourteen rallies to fight for peace.

    In Tokyo, the number of signatures exceeded 500,000 by the end of February.

    More than thirty representatives of student groups and other organizations held a meeting and decided to establish a permanent organization to fight for peace, named the "Peace Conference." A preparatory committee for the conference has been selected. The "Peace Conference" will address domestic issues related to the struggle for peace in Japan, in accordance with the resolutions of the Warsaw Peace Congress, and will support the Japanese Peace Committee. The preparatory committee has already held a meeting and decided to publish a journal to expose war preparations.
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 18th] The "Party's News Bulletin" published by the Japanese Communist Party on February 25th declared: Since the patriotic movement to strive for an overall peace has been launched among the working people and other classes in Japan, it has rapidly gained increasing support from people in various regions, especially in industrial areas such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, northern Kyushu, Yokohama, and coal mines in Hokkaido. In these areas, the number of votes supporting an overall peace and opposing the rearmament of Japan reaches tens of thousands in each place. It is worth noting that Social Democratic workers in various factories are also actively conducting the signature campaign together with members of the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party. This trend is particularly prominent in the Tokyo-Yokohama area, with Kawasaki Shipyard of Hitachi Works and Tsurumi Ironworks being notable examples.

    The governors and mayors of various prefectures and cities will be re-elected in April of this year. The united front candidates for the future have put forward two slogans: "Strive for an overall peace" and "Oppose rearmament." They are actively conducting pre-election activities.

    Young people and women are enthusiastically participating in activist meetings in the movement, and enlightened members of the Liberal Party and the National Democratic Party have also put forward many suggestions.

　　要求缔结全面和约
    日本展开签名运动
    东京签名者二月底已超过五十万
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社十七日电引东京消息：要求缔订全面和约并反对重新武装日本的征集签名运动，正在日本热烈地展开着。
    到三月七日为止，京都府已征集到三十万人签名。四十四个各种不同的团体积极地参加了这一运动，其中包括工会、学生团体和宗教团体等。京都府最近举行了十四次为争取和平而斗争的集会。
    在东京，签名的数目到二月底时已超过五十万。
    三十余名学生团体和其他团体的代表举行了会议，决定成立为争取和平而斗争的永久性组织，定名为“和平会议”。会议的筹备委员会已经选出。“和平会议”将按照华沙和平大会的决议，解决日本国内有关争取和平的斗争的问题，并将支持日本和平委员会。筹备委员会已召开过会议，决定出版一个期刊，以揭露战争准备。
    【新华社十八日讯】据日本共产党刊行的《党的新闻公报》二月二十五日宣称：争取全面缔和的爱国运动，自从在日本劳动人民和其他阶层人民中发动以来，即迅速地取得各地人民愈来愈多的支持，特别是在东京、大阪、神户、九州北部、横滨等工业地区和北海道的煤矿场。在这些地区中，拥护全面缔和反对日本重新武装的投票，每处的数目都有好几万。值得重视的是：各工厂的社会民主党工人也和共产党和劳农党的党员们一起，积极地进行征集投票运动。这种趋势在东京——横滨地区表现得特别突出，日立制作所的川崎造船厂和鹤见炼铁厂就是显著的例子。
    各地的县知事和市长均将于本年四月改选，未来的联合战线候选人提出了“争取全面缔和”及“反对重新武装”两个口号，他们正在积极地进行选前活动。
    青年们和妇女们都热烈地参加了运动中的积极分子会议，自由党和国民民主党的觉悟分子也提出了许多建议。
