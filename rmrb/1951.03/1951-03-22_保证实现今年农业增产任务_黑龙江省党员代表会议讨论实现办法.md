　　Guarantee the Realization of This Year's Agricultural Production Increase Task
    Heilongjiang Province Party Representatives Conference Discusses Implementation Methods
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Third Provincial Party Representatives Conference on February 20th. At the meeting, Zhao Dezun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a report entitled "Striving to Consolidate National Defense and Develop the Province's Economy." The report on developing agricultural production first pointed out that the province's farmers had seen significant improvements in their prosperity, farming conditions, and purchasing power. New middle peasants accounted for about 60 percent of farm households, and 8 percent were affluent middle peasants and a few new rich peasants. Despite severe disasters in 1950, a harvest of over 75 percent of a normal year was achieved. This year's planned planting area is 4.07 million hectares. In order to improve agricultural production throughout the province, it is necessary to make good agricultural production plans and conduct ideological mobilization work based on the characteristics of this year's situation. The following three ideological issues should be addressed: (1) Implement the idea of unifying increased production with consolidating national defense, and overcome the blind complacency of some cadres; (2) Implement the idea of unifying the comprehensive increase in production policy with organizing the work, and overcome one-sidedness in policy perspectives; (3) Learn and master agricultural techniques to lead increased production, and overcome generalized political appeals and empty production mobilization styles. The following key tasks for increasing production were also defined: (1) In addition to focusing on land reclamation and, where conditions permit, water conservancy projects, the main direction for increasing production is to promote intensive cultivation and strengthen the learning and leadership of agricultural techniques; (2) Widely mobilize women and semi-able-bodied laborers to participate in agricultural production; (3) Promote the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, and, where conditions permit (such as in western counties), promote the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and adhere to water management and the construction of protective forest belts; (4) Lead disaster-stricken areas in production for self-relief, pay attention to perennial disaster prevention, first of all, pay attention to preventing spring drought this year, and at the same time pay attention to caring for and supporting households in difficulty.
    Zhao Dezun pointed out that, in order to mobilize the people of the entire province to participate in the work of consolidating national defense and developing the province's economy, we must greatly enhance the Party's level and leadership. The main problems currently existing within the Party throughout the province are the phenomena of complacency and various forms of detachment from the masses. Overcoming these bad phenomena must begin with raising awareness ideologically and strengthening propaganda and education work both inside and outside the Party. It is necessary to resolutely implement the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses in the Entire Party" and strengthen the theoretical education of cadres throughout the Party. Only by improving the theoretical level of cadres can the cadres be fundamentally improved; only by establishing a propaganda network can the methods of leadership be fundamentally improved. Secondly, we must improve the Party organizationally and strictly adhere to the quality requirements for Party members. Class dissidents and degenerates must be purged, and ordinary Party members should be strengthened in education to raise their awareness. Finally, we must improve leadership methods, namely, to "fully prepare, clearly explain the reasons, carefully organize, inspect and summarize." We must closely link the Party with the masses of the people, unite as one, and ensure the success of consolidating national defense and developing the province's economic undertakings.

　　保证实现今年农业增产任务
    黑龙江省党员代表会议讨论实现办法
    中共黑龙江省委会，在二月二十日召开第三届全省党员代表会议。会上，省委书记赵德尊作了“为巩固祖国国防与发展本省经济而奋斗”的报告。关于发展农业生产的报告首先指出：全省农民的富裕程度、耕作条件、购买力等方面都有很大发展。新的中农已占农户百分之六十左右，并已出现百分之八的富裕中农和个别新富农。一九五○年严重受灾的情况下争取到七成五以上年景。今年计划播种四○七万垧。为了提高全省农业生产，必需做好农业生产计划，并根据今年情况特点作好思想动员工作，应着重解决以下三个思想问题：（一）贯彻增产与巩固国防一致的思想，克服某些干部的盲目自满情绪；（二）贯彻全面的增产政策与作好组织起来工作统一的思想，克服政策观点上的片面性；（三）学习掌握农业技术领导增产，克服一般化的政治号召与空洞的生产动员作风。并规定几项重要的增产工作：（一）除抓紧开荒与有条件地兴修水利外，增产方向主要是提倡精耕细作，加强农业技术的学习和领导；（二）广泛发动妇女半劳力参加农业生产；（三）提倡农副结合，有条件地（如西部县份）提倡农牧结合，坚持治水与修造防护林带；（四）领导灾区生产自救运动，注意常年防灾，首先注意防止今年春旱，同时注意照顾领导扶持困难户。
    赵德尊指出：为了动员全省人民参加巩固祖国国防与发展本省经济工作，必须以极大力量提高党的水平与党的领导。全省党内现在存在的主要问题是和平苟安的现象和各式各样脱离群众的现象。这些恶劣现象的克服，首先要从思想上提高，加强党内外的宣传教育工作入手。必须坚决地在全省党内贯彻执行中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”和加强干部理论教育，只有提高干部理论水平，才是根本提高干部的办法；只有建立宣传网，才能根本改善领导的方法。其次要从组织上提高党，严格党员的质量要求。对阶级异己分子及蜕化分子要清除出去，对一般的党员应该加强教育，提高他们的觉悟。最后，要提高领导方法，即做到“充分准备，讲清道理，周密组织，检查总结”。密切党与人民群众的联系，团结一致，保证巩固祖国国防与发展本省经济事业的成功。
