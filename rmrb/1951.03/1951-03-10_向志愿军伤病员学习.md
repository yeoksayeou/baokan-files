　　Learning from the Volunteer Army's Wounded and Sick
    Wu Han, Head of the Beijing People's Delegation to Korea

            I
    At the end of last year, with excitement and gratitude, and with the sincere and lofty love and respect of the broad masses of people in our rear for our Volunteer Army, we went to every hospital and every ward of the People's Volunteer Army to pay our respects to our wounded and sick soldiers and to convey the people's condolences. We also paid our respects and condolences to our brothers, the wounded and sick soldiers of the Korean People's Army.
    We said to the wounded and sick comrades that the quantity of慰劳品 (comfort goods) was small and meager, but through these concrete items, we brought to the hospital the unparalleled love of the people in the rear for our most outstanding and heroic commanders and fighters who were defending our homes and country. Some of the comfort bags were sewn by elderly mothers wearing reading glasses, late into the night. Every stitch and every thread contained the grateful feelings and loving thoughts of a kind mother. Some of the comfort bags were sewn by younger brothers and sisters who were in school. They saved their pocket money and bought what they thought were the best items, filled the bags to the brim, and repeatedly urged us to be sure to deliver them properly to the soldiers' hands. Some of the comfort bags were from our cadres in various agencies and soldiers in the troops, and they put almost all of their allowances, except for food, into the comfort bags. The most abundant in content were probably those from the industrial and commercial sectors, while those containing books and picture cards were probably from students, and those containing peanuts and dates were certainly from farmers and primary school students. In short, all levels, all professional departments, all regions, and all parties of the people in the rear were thinking of our Volunteer Army and wanted us to convey their heartfelt love for their sons and brothers at the front. We brought the warmth of a kind mother and the admiring feelings of younger brothers and sisters.
    We reported to the wounded and sick comrades the situation of the enthusiastic participation of young people in the rear in national defense schools, telling them many moving examples. One of them was a sixteen-year-old girl who failed to enlist and questioned her mother when she returned home, saying, "Mom, why didn't you give birth to me a year earlier? My studies are good, my body is strong, and what about my politics? I'm a member of the Youth League. There's no problem at all. There's only one thing, I don't meet the age requirement. Mom, why didn't you give birth to me a year earlier?" The mother had no choice but to reply, "Child, I've done my best for you. We got married the first year and gave birth to you the second year. What more do you want!" Another example was a boy who was qualified in age and height, but worried that his weight was not enough, so he ate a lot for a week and gained one kilogram, but he was still not accepted because his weight was still not enough. These examples illustrate the widespread demand of young people to enter military cadre schools and participate in the sacred work of defending our homes and country. These examples also fully illustrate the admiration of young people for our People's Volunteer Army, and they are eager to join the great ranks of resisting America and aiding Korea. We also reported that all regions, schools, and factories across the country sent their best students and best young workers to our military cadre schools. Our modern military cadres are being trained in large numbers, and young people are already flying in the skies of our motherland and patrolling our territorial waters. Our national defense cause is being established rapidly. We already have a strong force to repel and eliminate any enemy who dares to invade our country's borders!
    We also reported to the wounded and sick the grand occasion of the World Peace Congress, the enthusiastic cheers of the people of all countries for our Volunteer Army, the work of our own Peace Congress and local and branch congresses, and the demonstrations and parades against American imperialism by various occupational departments and religious groups in various regions. This shows that the entire Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world unanimously support and endorse the just war being waged by our Volunteer Army.
    When we said that our delegation to the United Nations was fighting on the UN stage on behalf of our 475 million people, severely criticizing the aggressive behavior of American imperialism, and winning the support of all peace-loving people around the world, the wounded and sick comrades smiled. When we talked about how the Chiang Kai-shek gang's representative, Chiang Ting-fu, looked pale and embarrassed when our representative spoke, the wounded and sick comrades laughed. When we said that the American imperialists were still not reconciled and were still trying to struggle and resist in Korea, the wounded and sick comrades unanimously raised their arms and shouted a loud slogan: "We must rest and recuperate with peace of mind, we must recover our health as soon as possible, and we must return to the front!"
            II
    Learn from the Volunteer Army's wounded and sick!
    Throughout the entire condolence work period, we all deeply felt that we had received far more than the wounded and sick comrades had received. We realized from them the strength of the new China, the unparalleled strength of the 475 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    Heroes never realize that they are heroes. On their sickbeds, we personally heard countless heroic and glorious epics, told so plainly and so peacefully, as if they were telling stories about someone else. "There's nothing great about it, I just eliminated a few enemies. I didn't complete the task well, I'm very ashamed. I'll go back when I recover." "The enemies are big, so you might suffer a loss in wrestling, but there's one good thing, they're easy to hit, one shot each." "They have everything, more guns, more cannons, more planes, more tanks. But the soldiers don't want to fight. They raise their hands as soon as you put a bayonet on them. I really don't understand, the rules of surrender must have been practiced beforehand, otherwise, how could they all do the same thing?" "They're really paper tigers, you can pierce them with one poke. What Chairman Mao said is absolutely right." "As long as we have fried flour and bullets, we are sure to win this war." One instructor, whose injuries were completely healed, but who was missing all his teeth, pursed his lips, complaining that it looked bad, and wearing a white mask, he came to request that his teeth be fitted as soon as possible, the sooner the better. When asked why he was in such a hurry, he said, "You're not in a hurry, but I am! Without teeth, I can't eat, and I can't go to the battlefield. If I go late, the enemies will run away. Don't you think I'm in a hurry?"
    In a large ward of more than forty people, after we had just finished speaking, we found that one wounded soldier suddenly covered his head with the quilt. We were regretting it, thinking that something we had said carelessly had stimulated the patient. The director took me closer to the bed, lifted the quilt, and saw that his eyes were full of tears. He was crying. When asked what was wrong, he choked up and said, "I didn't make any great contributions on the front line, and I got injured and came back, and I'm being taken care of like this. People from Chairman Mao are still coming to see us and shaking hands with us. He is so busy, but he still thinks about us. I really feel bad, I'm too touched." As he spoke, he continued to cry.
    Many seriously wounded soldiers asked us to say hello to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. We replied, "They are fine, very healthy." They said, "As long as Chairman and Commander-in-Chief are well, my wounds don't hurt anymore."
    On the walls, there were posters everywhere that said, "Be a combat hero on the front line, and be a model for recuperation in the hospital."
    In general hospitals, wounded and sick soldiers' management committees were organized. These were organizations of the wounded and sick soldiers themselves. They elected some members to manage affairs and help the hospital administration solve problems.
    There are countless model deeds. The night nurses stayed up many nights, and the lightly wounded patients forced them to rest and took over the duty themselves. Some lightly wounded patients took the initiative to wash the feet and carry the basins for the seriously wounded patients. One hospital was in the countryside, and the lightly wounded soldiers scrambled to carry water, carrying more than twenty loads a day. The staff persuaded him to rest, and he said, "You work so hard day and night, why shouldn't I do something?" One boy was only sixteen or seventeen years old, and his feet were frostbitten, but his spirit was excellent. He was always smiling and very likable. He was also good at talking and encouraging people. The duty doctor told us that this child was worth a good doctor. With him, the whole ward was like spring, and the doctors could work better, and the patients could recover faster.
    On the battlefield, they must make meritorious contributions, and the contributions they make are to kill enemies, kill more enemies, win battles, and win more and bigger victories. In the hospital, they must also make meritorious contributions, to make contributions as a model of recuperation, to make contributions in abiding by hospital rules, to make contributions in obeying treatment, and also to make contributions in learning culture. The hospital is not only a battlefield for making meritorious contributions, but also a school for making meritorious contributions.
    The wounded and sick soldiers demanded to learn culture. Everyone became a little teacher, teaching and learning from each other. Some did not know a single character when they entered the hospital, but after only a month or so, they learned more than two hundred characters. On their bedsides were comic strips, literacy textbooks, Chinese revolutionary stories, and all kinds of books. The more they learned, the faster they learned, and the faster their injuries healed.
    Walking out of the hospital, and thinking about it, who do the wounded and sick soldiers despise the most? American soldiers. What are they most proud of? The Chinese people. What do they most urgently demand? To return to the front as soon as possible.
    We took the most concrete lesson in despising, scorning, and hating America.
    We feel proud, because we belong to the country where these heroes grew up, the people of the great People's Republic of China.
            III
    We visited many wounded and sick soldiers and had many conversations with hospital staff. We understand the needs of our wounded and sick soldiers.
    First, we need surgical teams, the more the better, with sufficient surgical instruments and X-ray equipment.
    Second, we need internists and internal medicine.
    Third, we need specialists and equipment for otolaryngology and the fitting of prosthetic legs and arms.
    Fourth, we need cultural and entertainment equipment, especially film teams.
    Fifth, we need letters of condolence, written specifically, warmly, and vividly.
                                                      March 5th

　　向志愿军伤病员学习
    北京各界赴朝慰问团团长  吴晗
            一
    在去年年底，我们怀着兴奋而感激的心情，带着真挚的崇高的我国后方广大人民对我们的志愿军的热爱和崇敬，走到人民志愿军每一个病院，每一个病房，向我们的伤病员致敬，传达人民的慰问。也向我们的兄弟，朝鲜人民军的伤病员致敬和慰问。
    我们向伤病员同志说，慰劳品数量很少，也很菲薄，但是，通过这些具体物品，我们带到病院来的，是后方人民对我们最优秀最英勇进行保家卫国的指战员们的无比的热爱。有些慰问袋，是高龄的老母亲，戴着老花眼镜，在深更半夜赶缝出来的，每一针每一线，都包含着慈母的感激心情，爱念心情。有些慰问袋，是正在学校里的小弟妹们缝制的，他们节约了自己的零用钱，买了她或他们自己认为最好的物品，把袋子装得满满的，还再三叮嘱，一定要妥善送到战士的手里。有的慰问袋是我们各机关干部和部队战士的，他们差不多把伙食以外的全部给养都放进慰问袋里去了。慰问袋内容最丰富的大概是工商界的，装着书本画片的大概是学生，装着花生枣子的准是农民和小学生的。总之，后方各阶层，各职业部门，各地区，各党派，一切广大人民，都在怀念我们的志愿军，都要我们传达对在前方的子弟们的由衷之爱。我们带来的是慈母的温暖和弟妹的爱慕心情。
    我们向伤病员同志报道后方青年踊跃参加国防学校的情况，告诉他们以许多动人的实例。其中之一是有一个十六岁的女孩子，参军不成功，回家责问母亲说：“妈妈，你为什么不早生我一年？我功课好，身体棒，政治呢？我是青年团员。全没问题。只是一样，年龄不及格。妈妈，你为什么不早生我一年呢？”妈妈没办法，回答说：“孩子，我也对得起你了，我们头年结婚，第二年就生下你，还要怎么样呢！”另一个例子是一个年龄和身长都够格的男孩子，担心体重不够，回家大吃一星期，长了一公斤，结果还是没有录取，因为体重还是不够格。这些例子说明了广大青年普遍地要求进入军事干部学校，参加保家卫国的神圣工作。这些例子也充分说明了广大青年对我们人民志愿军的爱慕，他（她）们渴望能够参加伟大的抗美援朝的行列。我们也报道了全国各地区各学校各工厂把他们最好的学生，最好的青年工人送进我们的军事干部学校，我们的现代化的军事干部在大量培养着，青年们已经飞翔在我们祖国的天空了，已经在我们的领海巡弋了。我们的国防事业，在突飞猛进地建立着，我们已经具有强大的力量，击退和消灭敢于侵袭祖国边疆的任何敌人了！
    我们也向伤病员们报告世界和平大会开会的盛况，各国人民对我们志愿军的热烈欢呼盛况，我们自己的和平大会和各地和大分会的工作，各地区的各职业部门、各宗教团体反美帝国主义示威游行的情况。说明全中国人民，全世界爱好和平人民一致支持和拥护我们志愿军所进行的正义的战争。
    当我们说到我们在联合国的代表团，代表着我们四亿七千五百万人民在联合国讲坛上进行斗争，严厉指斥美帝国主义的侵略行为，博得全世界爱好和平人民的支持的时候，伤病员同志们笑了。当我们说到蒋匪帮代表蒋廷黻，在我们代表发言时候，那种脸如土色狼狈不堪的情况，伤病员同志们笑了。当我们说到美帝国主义还不死心，还妄图在朝鲜挣扎顽抗下去的时候，伤病员同志不约而同，举臂喊出响亮的口号：“我们要安心休养，我们要早日恢复健康，我们要重返前线！”
            二
    向志愿军伤病员学习！
    在整个慰问工作时期内，我们大家都深深感觉到，我们所得到的远比伤病员同志为多，我们从他们那里体会到新中国的力量，四亿七千五百万人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的无比的力量。
    英雄们从来也没有意识到他自己是英雄，在病榻上，我们亲自听到无数英勇的辉煌的史诗，说得那样平淡，那样安详，好像是在说别一个人的故事。“没有什么了不起，仅仅只消灭了那几个敌人，任务没很好完成，很惭愧，伤好了还要去。”“敌人个子大，摔跤许要吃亏，有一样好处，容易打，一枪一个。”“他们样样多，枪多炮多飞机多，坦克多。就是兵不愿打，一上刺刀就举手，真不明白，投降的规矩也是练好了来的，要不，怎么全是那一套？”“真是纸老虎，一戳就穿，咱们毛主席的话错不了。”“只要有炒面，有子弹，这个仗是赢定了。”有一个指导员，伤全好了，只是满嘴没有一个牙齿，瘪着嘴嫌不好看，带着白口罩，他跑来提出要求要尽快给他装牙齿，愈快愈好，问他为什么这样着急呢？他说：“你不急，我急呀，没牙齿啃不了东西，也上不了战场，去晚了敌人跑光了，你说急不急？”
    在四十多人的一个大病房里，刚说完了话，发现有一个伤员突然用被蒙住头，我们正在懊悔，以为是有什么话说得不当心，刺激了病人。院长带我走近病床，掀开被一看，他满眼泪水，原来是哭了。问是什么缘故，他哽咽着说：“上火线没立什么大功，受了伤回来，这般照顾。毛主席那里来的人，还来看我们，还和我们拉手，他老人家那样忙，还惦念着我们，实在过意不去，太感动了。”说着说着还是哭。
    有好多重伤员向我们问毛主席和朱总司令好，我们回说“挺好，很健康”。他们说：“只要主席和总司令好，我伤口也不疼了。”
    在墙壁上，到处都贴着“在前线要当战斗英雄，在病院要作休养模范”。
    一般病院里都组织了伤病员管理委员会，是伤病员自己的组织，自己推选出一些委员来管理事务，帮助病院行政方面解决问题。
    模范的事迹是数说不完的，值夜护士熬了多少夜，轻伤病员就强迫她去休息，自己来值班，有的轻伤病员主动地替重伤员洗脚，端盆子。有一个病院在乡间，轻伤员抢着挑水，一天挑二十多挑，工作人员劝他休息，他说：“你们那样成天成晚工作，为什么我不应该做一些事？”有一个娃儿才十六七岁，冻坏了脚，精神极好，成天满脸是笑，怪逗人喜欢，又会说话，会鼓舞人，值班医生告诉我们，这孩子抵得过一个好医生，有了他整个病房都像春天，医生好作事，病人也好得快了。
    在战场上要立功，立的功是杀敌人，杀更多的敌人，打胜仗，打更多的更大的胜仗。在病院里也要立功，要立休养模范的功，要立遵守院规的功，要立服从治疗的功，还要立学习文化的功。病院不止是立功的战场，还是立功的学校。
    伤病员们要求学习文化，大家做小先生，互教互学，有的入院时还不认识一个字，才过个把月，就学会二百多字了，床头摆的是连环画，识字课本，中国革命故事和各种各样的书。学得多，学得快，伤也就好得快。
    走出病院，想一想，伤病员们所最看不起的是谁？美国兵。所最引以自豪的是什么？中国人民。所最急迫要求的是什么？早日回到前线。
    我们上了鄙视蔑视仇视美国最具体的一课。
    我们感觉得骄傲，因为我们是属于这些英雄们所生长的国度，伟大的中华人民共和国的人民。
            三
    我们慰问了很多伤病员，也和病院工作人员作了很多次谈话，我们了解我们伤病员的需要。
    第一需要手术队，数量愈多愈好，要带足够的外科器械，和Ｘ光设备。
    第二需要内科医师和内科药品。
    第三需要五官科和装假脚假手的专科人才和设备。
    第四需要文化娱乐器材，特别是电影队。
    第五需要慰问信，要写得具体、亲切、生动。
                                                      三月五日
