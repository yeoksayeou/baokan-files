What to Learn from "Dragon Beard Ditch"?
	Zhou Yang

The performance of "Dragon Beard Ditch" in Beijing has been well received. This is a good play. Mr. Lao She's skillful realistic technique and unique humorous talent, combined with his high political enthusiasm for the new society, have enabled him to make new progress in artistic creation. "Fang Zizhu" was a success, followed by another success with "Dragon Beard Ditch," which surpassed "Fang Zizhu." This is something we should all be happy about and celebrate.

We must learn from Mr. Lao She's success; that is to say, we must learn something from the creative experience of "Dragon Beard Ditch."

First of all, it can be seen that Mr. Lao She supports the People's Government with high political enthusiasm, and it is this enthusiasm that gives him an irresistible creative impulse. In his article "I Love New Beijing," he frankly and passionately confessed this feeling. He said:

"What touches me the most is that this government, which serves the people, does not only repair ditches for main roads, but also takes care of remote areas that have always been neglected by the reactionary government. In the past, the reactionary government sucked the blood of the people and dumped sewage and garbage outside the doors of the poor, teaching them to 'enjoy' the life of pigs and dogs. Now, the government sees where it is most dirty and where there are the most diseases, and starts to repair it from there; the eyes of the new government are on the poor and suffering people."

He is talking about the repair of Dragon Beard Ditch here. From this incident, he clearly saw the truly popular nature of the new government. He is grateful for such a government. In "The Writing Process of 'Dragon Beard Ditch'," he said:

"It is not just the people of 'Dragon Beard Ditch' who are grateful to the government; anyone with a heart should be! I was moved, and I wanted to write about it, no matter how well or badly. My enthusiasm for thanking the government made me dare to take the risk."

This not only shows an artist's most precious political enthusiasm, but also an artist's equally precious genuine courage. He felt that it was the artist's responsibility to praise such a good government.

For an old writer like Mr. Lao She, who has rich social experience and observation and judgment abilities, descriptions based on concepts or empty praise are what he is unwilling to do. He is so familiar with the old Beijing and so loves the new Beijing that he cannot help but pay attention to and care about all the changes in the lives of the working people of Beijing, which reflect the results of the implementation of various policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government. The first task of the Communist Party and the People's Government among the people is to give the working people practical and visible material benefits, and then, on this basis, to gradually improve the people's political awareness and cultural level. This is the foundation of all policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Aunt Wang, in "Dragon Beard Ditch," although timid and old-fashioned, is a hardworking and lovely person. She cannot help but admit: "The Communist Party builds toilets for us, catches thieves, and digs ditches. It's not bad." She also felt the benefits that the revolution brought to Dragon Beard Ditch. The people judge and understand our policies not from policy clauses, but from their own vital interests. If writers want to correctly represent policies, they must constantly care about and understand the daily lives and daily interests of the masses, understand their concerns about firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and at the same time, look towards their more beautiful future prospects. "Dragon Beard Ditch" precisely demonstrates the policies of the People's Government from these aspects.

All policies must be tested among the masses, and the masses' response to policies is the most reliable standard for judging the correctness of policies. Without repairing Dragon Beard Ditch, the masses of Dragon Beard Ditch would not support the government so enthusiastically. Mr. Lao She keenly observed the profound psychological changes in various characters caused by the influence of the revolution. The people of Dragon Beard Ditch, who have been oppressed, insulted, and harmed for many years, cannot recognize and believe in the Communist Party all at once. Didn't Aunt Wang say: "I'm puzzled, the officials now give us money to build toilets and things, what are they trying to get for themselves? … I can hardly believe it." But there are indeed such people in the world, their names are Communist Party members, they contribute everything to the people—including their lives—and do not ask for any price from the people. This is a miracle. But this is absolutely true. People can only believe in the facts. Dragon Beard Ditch, like all other places in the new China, is beginning to change.

The author did not write Dragon Beard Ditch as a naturally bad place. Its dirt and stench were created by the old society. "If the officials are bad, the place will be smelly." The rule of bureaucratic despots is the root of all the disasters of the people of Dragon Beard Ditch. When the Communist Party came, Dragon Beard Ditch changed. As Crazy Cheng sings: "From now on, the ditch water is clear, the country is peaceful and the people enjoy peace." New hope naturally burns in people's hearts. Fourth Sister said: "When the ditch is repaired and people become better, how wonderful will that be!" Old Zhao said more definitely: "If we only have a few new toilets and two clean streets, but people's hearts haven't changed, what's the point?" In fact, everything has changed. Crazy Cheng is no longer crazy. Ding Si, who didn't work hard, has become a good worker. The henchman has reformed. Dragon Beard Ditch, which was originally as stagnant as dead water, has become boiling. Transforming the goldfish pond of Dragon Beard Ditch into a beautiful park is not just Crazy Cheng's dream, but also a reasonable hope for Fourth Sister and all the people of Dragon Beard Ditch. In this way, Mr. Lao She described the changes in Dragon Beard Ditch and its people, powerfully confirming the power of the People's Government and its policies to turn the world upside down.

"Dragon Beard Ditch" doesn't have any special story. Mr. Lao She simply faithfully recorded the event of repairing Dragon Beard Ditch, but he didn't make a news report-style record, nor did he write about real people and real events. He created several truly vivid and characteristic characters. He made these characters all connected to Dragon Beard Ditch, in the author's words, "like some small tributaries of the ditch." From the characters' mouths and actions, he cleverly explained the stinking ditch, and conversely, in each character's relationship with the ditch, he cleverly depicted each character's personality and outlook on life, their entire spiritual world. Here, Mr. Lao She closely grasped the principle of centralization in depicting characters and events. He strictly selected his creative materials; he was willing to abandon all parts of the material that were irrelevant to the current theme. He does not make his characters bear too many or extra tasks. At the same time, he never describes a character in isolation, but always places him in the mutual relationship between people. The author's method of creating character is particularly worthy of learning for our many young authors.

"Dragon Beard Ditch," such a dirty and smelly slum, but so many pure and noble hearts grew from there. The lovely Little Niu was buried before she even grew up. Crazy Cheng, who was so kind and pure, was bullied to such an extent. But no matter what, people have to live on. The people of Dragon Beard Ditch fought against the bureaucratic despots pressing on their heads, and against the poverty, disease, and all the disasters that tormented them. Mr. Lao She wrote about the industriousness of the working people, their tenacious and resilient life force, and their longing for a better life. Aunt Wang, a conservative among the poor in Dragon Beard Ditch, is the only one who calls Dragon Beard Ditch a "treasure land." She has her reasons:

"It's dirty here, but there's work to do! …

"It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman here, as long as you're willing to work, you'll have food to eat; that's the truth, everything else is nonsense! This is a treasure land, if it weren't a treasure land, how could more and more people come?"

But Aunt Wang's daughter, this young girl full of rebelliousness and enterprise, can't wait to jump out of this stinking ditch as soon as possible. Ding Si, who is half-hearted and can be good or bad, would rather ride a rickshaw to get away from this stinking ditch. Of course, these are not solutions to the problem. Only Old Zhao, the representative of the positive characters in the play, sees it more clearly. He said:

"Ah, Dragon Beard Ditch is not a bad place!

"Crazy Cheng often says: 'If the ditch is not smelly and the water is clear, the country is peaceful and the people enjoy peace.' He's right, he's not crazy! Only with honest officials can there be clear water. I'm a plasterer, I know. In the city, the big officials live there, and they build asphalt roads there; whoever becomes an official builds tall buildings and tile houses. We poor people, no one cares!"

"With that bunch of officials, we'll always have to live next to the stinking ditch, damn it, you just say, there's tap water everywhere in the city, but we don't have it here!"

Old Zhao, this protester of the old society, naturally became an active participant and supporter of the new regime after liberation. The new government eliminated the local tyrant Black Whirlwind for the people and repaired the stinking ditch. The people of Dragon Beard Ditch truly felt the benefits of liberation. But the tyrant did not appear in this play, nor did it directly write about the scene of mass struggle. However, we can still feel the tense struggle. When the henchman talks to Old Zhao and threatens him, listen to how Old Zhao answers:

"Old Zhao: Everyone elected me as a committee member, so I have to do my best for everyone. I help good people; I fight bad people.
Henchman: You want to become a tyrant too!
Old Zhao: Black Whirlwind is a tyrant; I am the enemy of tyrants!
Henchman: Okay, you have a lot of strength!
Old Zhao: My strength is given to me by the new government!"

How clear is this right and wrong, how sharp, how weighty are these words. Later, the henchman transformed, and Old Zhao asked him to apologize to Crazy Cheng. Fourth Sister persuaded Crazy Cheng to give him a slap in the face in the same way, but Crazy Cheng didn't hit him, he just asked the henchman to stretch out his hand for him to see, and said: "Ah, yours is also a human hand. Go!"

Such a simple action, a simple sentence, but how shocking, how powerful. Mr. Lao She wrote truly vivid, refined, personalized, and thoughtful language.

Mr. Lao She is very familiar with his characters and is full of love for them. He consciously avoids describing people and things that he is not familiar with or clear about, and focuses on describing the people and things that he is familiar with and clear about. But he did not stay within the scope of his existing experience, he tried to contact and understand the new environment, and let his characters grow and develop in this new environment. If necessary, he endowed his characters with a certain romantic color, so that the realistic and ideal elements achieved a harmonious combination. But because each character has a certain basis in his life experience, and he relies on his excellent ability to use language, the character images he creates are not conceptualized or false, but vivid and real.

From "Dragon Beard Ditch," we can learn many things, mainly to learn Mr. Lao She's true political enthusiasm and truly realistic writing attitude.

When we praise Mr. Lao She's success in the creation of the "Dragon Beard Ditch" script, we must also mention the outstanding achievements of Mr. Jiao Juyin and many actors in the performance. Mr. Jiao Juyin's direction made good use of Stanislavski's method, the basic spirit of which is to learn from life. He made many useful additions to the original in terms of plot arrangement and character depiction, so that the ideological and artistic nature of the original reached a higher level of concentration and refinement. Here, the director completed his collective creative task. The performances of the actors were also serious and excellent. The fact that the actors actually experienced life in Dragon Beard Ditch for nearly two months is undoubtedly the basic reason for the success of the performance. This practice of the Beijing People's Art Theater is worthy of learning by all acting groups. Without the unremitting pursuit of life and the tenacious and persevering effort to understand life, we cannot create truly realistic art, nor can we effectively prevent or overcome the erroneous tendencies of formalism and formalism in art.

"Dragon Beard Ditch" is a realistic work, and also a song of praise to the working people, a song of praise to the Communist Party and the People's Government. Mr. Lao She has drawn new creative energy from the revolution and has learned many new things, and he is still constantly learning. Then, let all our literary and art workers learn with him and learn from him.

　　从《龙须沟》学习什么？
    周扬
    《龙须沟》在北京上演，得到了人们的好评。这是一个好剧本。老舍先生所擅长的写实手法和独具的幽默才能，与他对新社会的高度政治热情结合起来，使他在艺术创作上迈进了新的境地。《方珍珠》是一个成功，紧接着《龙须沟》又是一个成功，而且把《方珍珠》赛过了。这是值得我们大家高兴的，庆贺的。
    我们必须从老舍先生的这个成功中取得经验；这就是说，必须从《龙须沟》的创作经验中学习一些东西。
    首先，可以看到，老舍先生是以高度的政治热情来拥护人民政府的，正是这种热情，给了他一种不可克制的创作冲动。他在《我爱新北京》一文中直率地、热烈地告白了他的这种心情。他说：
    “最使我感动的是：这个为人民服务的政府并不只为通衢大道修沟。而是也首先顾到一向被反动政府所忽视的偏僻地方。在以前，反动政府是吸去人民的血，而把污水和垃圾倾倒在穷人的门外，教他们“享受”猪狗的生活。现在，政府是看那里最脏，疾病最多，便先从那里动手修整；新政府的眼是看着穷苦人民的。”
    他这里就是说的修龙须沟的事。他从这一件事上也清楚看出了新政府的真正人民的性质。他感激这样的政府。他在“《龙须沟》写作经过”中说：
    “感激政府的岂止是《龙须沟》的人民呢，有人心的都应当在内啊！我受了感动，我要把这件事写出来，不管写得好与不好。我的感激政府的热忱使我敢去冒险。”
    这里不但表现了一个艺术家最可宝贵的政治热情，而且也表现了同样可宝贵的艺术家的真正的勇气。他觉得歌颂这样的好政府是艺术家应有的责任。
    对于像老舍先生这样一个具有丰富社会经验与观察和判断能力的老作家，从概念出发的描写或空洞的歌颂都是他所不愿为的。他是那样熟悉旧的北京，又是那样热爱新的北京，他不能不注意与关心北京劳动人民生活中的一切变化，这些变化正反映出了共产党和人民政府的各种政策实施的结果。共产党和人民政府在人民中间进行的第一位工作就是给劳动人民以实际的看得见的物质福利，然后在这个基础上一步一步地去提高人民的政治觉悟和文化程度。这就是共产党和人民政府的一切政策的根本。《龙须沟》中的那位虽然胆子小、思想旧，但却是克苦耐劳的可爱的王大妈，她也不得不承认：“共产党给咱们修茅房、抓小偷、还要挖沟，总算不错。”她也感觉到了革命给龙须沟带来的好处。人民不是从政策条文，而是从他们的切身利益来判断和理解我们的政策的。作家要正确地表现政策，就必须经常地关心和了解群众的日常生活，日常利益，了解他们柴米油盐的事情，同时眼睛朝着他们的更美好的未来的远景。《龙须沟》正是从这些方面表现了人民政府的政策。
    一切政策都要在群众中受到考验，群众对于政策的反应是判断政策的正确性的最可靠的标准。不修龙须沟，龙须沟的群众就不会那样热烈地拥护政府。老舍先生锐利地观察到了革命的影响所引起的各种人物的深刻的心理变化。龙须沟的人们，多少年来被压迫、被侮辱、被损害，他们不是一下子就能认识和相信共产党的。王大妈不是说了吗：“我就纳闷儿，现在作官的都把钱给咱们修盖厕所什么的，他们自己图什么呢？……我简直不敢相信。”但世界上就的确出现了这么一种人，他们的名字叫共产党员，他们贡献自己一切—包括自己的生命—给人民，而并不向人民索任何代价。这是奇迹。然而这是千真万确的。人们只能相信事实。龙须沟，正如新中国的一切其它地方一样，是在开始变化了。
    作者没有将龙须沟写成天然的坏地方。它的脏、臭是旧社会所造成的。“作官的坏，地方才稀臭。”官僚恶霸的统治是龙须沟人们的一切灾难的根源。共产党来了，龙须沟就变样了。正如程疯子唱的：“从此后，沟水清，国泰民安享太平。”在人们心中自然地燃烧起了新的希望。四嫂说：“赶明儿个，沟修好了，人也变好了，有多么棒呢！”赵老头说的更肯定：“咱们这儿要光有几处新茅房，两条干净的街，人心都没变，那有什么意思呢？”事实上是一切都变化了。程疯子不疯了。不好好干活的丁四变成为一个好的工人了。狗腿子改邪归正了。原来像死水一样停滞的龙须沟变得沸腾起来了。把龙须沟的金鱼池改造成一个美丽的公园，就不只是程疯子一个人的梦想，也成为了四嫂和一切龙须沟人们的合理希望。就这样，老舍先生描写了龙须沟和龙须沟人们的变化，有力地证实了人民政府和它的政策的旋转乾坤的力量。
    《龙须沟》并没有什么特别的故事，老舍先生不过忠实纪录了修龙须沟的事件，但他没有做新闻报道式的纪录，也没有写真人真事，他创造了几个真正活生生的有性格的人物。他使这些人物都和龙须沟联系起来，用作者的话来说，“像沟的一些小支流”。他由人物的口中和行动中，巧妙地说明了臭沟，反过来又在每个人物对沟的关系上，巧妙地描出了各个人物的性格和人生观，他们整个的精神世界。在这里，老舍先生在描写人物和事件上，紧紧掌握了集中化的原则。他严格地选择了他的创作材料；他舍得抛弃材料中一切与当前主题无关的部分。他不使他的人物负担过多的或分外的任务。同时他从不孤立地去描写一个人物，而总是将他放在人与人之间的相互关系中去描写。作者创造人物性格的方法，是特别值得我们许多青年作者学习的。
    《龙须沟》，一个多么脏、多么臭的贫民窟，但从那儿却生长出这么许多纯洁的，高尚的心灵。那么可爱的小妞子，当她还没有成长起来之前就被葬送了。心地那么善良、那么纯厚的程疯子却被人欺凌到那种地步。但是不管怎么，人们总得生活下去。龙须沟的人们就这样和压在他们头上的官僚恶霸，和折磨他们的贫穷、疾病与一切灾难斗争。老舍先生写出了劳动人民的勤劳，他们顽强的和坚韧的生活力量，以及他们对于更好的生活的渴望。王大妈，在龙须沟的穷人中是一个保守派，只有她才叫龙须沟“宝地”。她有她的道理：
    “这儿脏，可有活儿干呢！……
    “这儿不分男女，只要肯动手，就有饭吃；这是真的，别的都是瞎扯！这儿是宝地，要不是宝地，怎样越来人越多？”
    可是王大妈的女儿，这位充满反抗性和进取心的青年姑娘，却恨不得早早跳出这臭沟。三心二意、可好可坏的丁四，为了要躲躲这臭沟，宁可去蹬三轮。当然这都不是解决问题的办法。只有赵老头，剧中积极人物的代表者，他看的比较清楚。他说：
    “啊，龙须沟可不是坏地方！
    “程疯子常说：什么‘沟不臭，水又清，国泰民安享太平。’他说得对，他不疯！有了清官，才能有清水。我是个泥水匠，我知道。城里头，大官儿在那儿住，那儿就修柏油大马路；谁作了官，谁就盖高楼大瓦房。咱们穷人哪，没人管！”
    “有那群作官的，咱们永远得住在臭沟旁边，他妈的，你就说，全城到处有自来水，就是咱们这儿没有！”
    赵老头，这位旧社会的抗议者，解放以后，就自然地成为了新政权的积极参加者、拥护者。新政府为人民铲除了恶霸黑旋风，修好了臭沟。龙须沟的人们是真正身受到解放的好处了。但是在这戏里恶霸并没有出场，也没有正面写群众斗争的场面。然而我们却依然感觉得到紧张的斗争。当狗腿子和赵老头谈话，威胁他的时候，你听赵老头是怎么回答：
    “赵老：大家选举我作委员，我就得为大家出力。好人，我帮忙；坏人，我斗争。
    狗子：你也要成为一霸！
    赵老：黑旋风是一霸；我是恶霸的对头！
    狗子：好，你有股子硬劲儿！
    赵老：我的劲儿是新政府给我的！”
    这是多么是非分明，多么锋利，多么有斤两的话。后来狗子转变了，赵老头叫他给程疯子来赔不是，四嫂在一旁劝疯子照样儿还给他一顿嘴巴，这时疯子却不打他，只要狗子伸出手给他看看，说了句：“啊，你的也是人手。去吧！”
    这么一个简单动作，一句简单的话，但是多么地震动人心，多么地有力。老舍先生写出了真正生动的、经过提炼的、性格化的、有思想的语言。
    老舍先生是十分熟悉自己的人物的，并且对他们那样充满了热爱。他有意识地避免描写他所不熟悉、不清楚的人和事，而紧紧抓紧住他所熟悉和清楚的人和事去用力描写。但他并没有停留在自己已有的经验范围内，他尽量去接触和理解新的环境，并且让他的人物放到这个新的环境中去成长，去发展，如果需要，他就赋与他的人物以某种浪漫的色彩，使现实和理想的因素取得和谐的结合。但究竟因为每个人物都在他的生活经验中有一定的张本，又凭借了他卓越的运用语言的能力，所以他创造出来的人物形象就不是概念化的、虚假的，而是活生生的、真实的。
    从《龙须沟》，我们可以学到许多东西，主要的就是要学习老舍先生的真正的政治热情与真正的现实主义的写作态度。
    在我们评赞老舍先生在《龙须沟》剧本创作中的成功的时候，我们必须同时提到焦菊隐先生和许多演员在演出上的卓越的成就。焦菊隐先生的导演很好地运用了史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的方法，这个方法的基本精神就是向生活学习。他在剧情安排和性格描写上对原作作了不少有益的补充，使原作的思想性和艺术性达到了更高的集中和提炼。在这里，导演完成了他的集体的创造性的任务。演员们的表演，也是认真的，出色的。演员们到龙须沟实际地去体验生活近两个月，这无疑地是表演成功的基本原因。北京人民艺术剧院的这种作法是值得一切演剧团体学习的。没有不断地追求生活，理解生活的顽强的坚忍的努力，我们是不能创造出真正现实主义的艺术，也是不能有效地防止或克服艺术上的公式主义，形式主义等等的错误倾向的。
    《龙须沟》是一个现实主义的作品，也是一首对劳动人民的颂歌，对共产党和人民政府的颂歌。老舍先生从革命吸取了新的创作精力，学习了许多新的东西，他还在继续不断地学习着。那末，让我们所有的文艺工作者都和他一同学习，并向他学习吧。
