　　How to Fulfill the Great Task of Increasing Cotton Production This Year?
　　Vice Minister of Agriculture, Central People's Government, Yang Xiandong
　　In the past, under the multiple controls and exploitation of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, cotton production in our country was never able to develop. The raw materials for the cotton textile industry have always relied on the import of large quantities of foreign cotton to maintain operations. Imported cotton often accounted for the first or second highest value of imported trade goods. After the liberation of the whole country, in 1950, the People's Government vigorously engaged in increasing cotton production. In one year, production increased by 58.9 percent, and the total output exceeded the average output of the five years before the war, from 1933 to 1937, by 11 percent. This basically met the raw material needs of the existing number of spindles in operation nationwide, fundamentally reversing the situation of heavy reliance on foreign cotton for decades. This is something that makes us very excited.

　　The people of New China have a great need for cloth.
　　Taking the Northeast as an example, the sales volume of cotton cloth in the rural areas of the Northeast has changed greatly in the past year. In 1947, only 800,000 bolts were sold, increasing to 1.2 million bolts in 1948, 3.2 million bolts in 1949, and 13 million bolts in 1950, an increase of more than 16 times in three years. This shows how huge the consumption of cotton textiles is after land reform and the development of production improve people's lives.

　　Due to the drastic increase in the need for cotton, developing cotton production has become a major link in the current industrial and agricultural construction. In 1951, we must use all possible forces to make cotton production rapidly catch up with the needs of industrial raw materials and people's daily use, to achieve the goal of complete self-sufficiency in cotton.

　　The State Council's "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951" has pointed out that increasing cotton production is an extremely important task in 1951, and we must expand cotton fields as much as possible on the basis of 1950, increase the yield per unit area, and increase cotton production by 36.9 percent. In order to more fully supply the need for cotton, we should also strive to overfulfill the above tasks as much as possible.

　　The task of increasing cotton production in 1951 is very important, and there will inevitably be many difficulties in completing the task. For example, the masses in cotton-growing areas may not fully understand the government's policies for a while; in more concentrated cotton-growing areas, there is a lack of food, fuel, and feed, which cannot be fully and reasonably supplied under current conditions; there are still many natural disasters, and the yield of cotton fields cannot be well guaranteed; some areas still lack fertilizer and agricultural tools, and newly expanded cotton-growing areas and disaster areas lack cotton seeds... etc. Therefore, in this year's production, we need to focus on overcoming these difficulties.

　　Based on the work experience of 1950, to successfully complete the task of increasing cotton production in 1951, we must first grasp the various policies for rewarding cotton planting, and the most important of these is to ensure a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio policy. Cotton is commodity production, and a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio and ensuring timely procurement are the most important keys to developing cotton production. In 1950, the country vigorously implemented a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio policy. This policy guaranteed that planting cotton was more profitable than planting grain, thus greatly stimulating the increase in cotton production. However, the cotton-grain price ratio in 1950 was announced slightly late, and there were some deviations in the implementation in a few areas, failing to ensure that all cotton farmers received the actual benefits of the guaranteed price. To this end, the Central Financial and Economic Commission has reasonably adjusted the cotton-grain price ratio standard for 1951 on the basis of the 1950 cotton-grain price ratio, not only generally increasing the price ratio in various regions, but also affirming that this is the minimum price that cotton farmers actually receive in the local market. Regardless of the season, it must not be lower than this price ratio standard. This is a very firm policy to guarantee cotton prices. All regions should vigorously implement the newly set price ratio before spring plowing and sowing. At the same time, we must also correctly implement the grade price difference policy, that is, high-quality cotton gets high prices, and low-quality cotton gets low prices, to protect the interests of the masses and improve the quality of cotton.

　　In addition to the cotton-grain price ratio policy, we should implement cotton pre-purchase or credit purchase policies with emphasis. In 1950, state-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and cooperatives in the Northeast and the Plain area signed physical pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers using grain, bean cake, and coal. The Lucheng County Cooperative in Shanxi Province signed credit pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers, and the cotton farmers responded very well. They said, "Contracts are signed in the spring and cotton is delivered in the fall. See if I plant cotton or not." This is an effective way to dispel the concerns of cotton farmers and specifically help them with production. This year, in cotton-growing areas with conditions, we should vigorously carry out pre-purchase or credit purchase work through cooperatives.

　　In addition, we should implement a reward policy for cotton planting. The Agricultural Tax Law stipulates that if cotton planting results in more income, it is still taxed as if it were grain land. In 1950, the Central Financial and Economic Commission officially announced the regulation of using cotton to pay public grain. All localities are implementing this, which has removed the concerns of cotton farmers who were afraid of having to pay more due to planting cotton and who were afraid of not having enough grain to pay public grain, thus not daring to plant more cotton. This has played a great role in expanding cotton fields. However, cotton-growing areas are short of grain. If they hand in grain during the summer tax collection, they still have to buy grain later, and the masses still feel inconvenience. Therefore, the State Council's "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951" stipulates: "The agricultural burden of cotton farmers must be collected once in the autumn" to facilitate farmers.

　　After the policy of rewarding cotton planting is decided, we should also take some practical measures to support these policies.

　　The State Council's "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951" proposes: "In order to increase the production per unit area of cotton fields, attention must be paid to timely irrigation and drainage, the supply of fertilizers, and pesticides and machinery for the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests." Therefore, the provinces and regions that mainly produce cotton should give priority to supplying the needs of cotton-growing areas with funds for water conservancy and scientific pest control medicines and machinery that can be mastered. In addition, all localities should combine with trade, cooperation, banking and other departments to vigorously carry out the following three economic tasks in a planned way: (1) Largely supplement the shortage of production materials such as fertilizers and agricultural tools in cotton-growing areas; (2) Supply cotton-growing areas with food and daily necessities, and adjust the shortage of fuel and feed as much as possible within the possible range; (3) Adjust cotton seeds for areas lacking seeds.

　　In terms of adjusting cotton seeds, in 1950, an unprecedented 106.5 million catties of cotton seeds were adjusted, solving the difficulty of lacking seeds for 6 to 7 million mu of cotton fields. However, many errors also occurred in the seed adjustment work in 1950, and some even caused significant losses. The main errors were that the situation of seed shortage was not correctly estimated, blind adjustments were carried out, or a large amount of long-distance transportation was carried out, and a series of meticulous organizational work such as seed selection, acquisition, transportation, and loan distribution was not done well, resulting in some phenomena such as too poor germination rate. In 1951, we must avoid repeating the same mistakes in this regard.

　　As for cotton farmers, this year we should launch a mass movement to improve cotton planting technology.

　　Strengthening cotton planting technology guidance, carrying out mass improvement of cotton seeds, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and improving farming technology are the main links to increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields. Cotton seed improvement must be based on the continuous selection of seeds by the broad masses, especially the selection of seeds before sowing, which is simple and easy to implement and can be widely promoted. The promotion of fine cotton varieties reached 10.47 million mu in 1950, and it is required to expand the promotion and breeding to 19 million mu in 1951. A five-year plan for the popularization of fine varieties should be implemented step by step.

　　Among the natural disasters of cotton, insect pests are the most common. In 1951, all localities should make full use of domestic pesticides, promote local methods of prevention and control, take effective measures against the main insect pests that occur, such as cotton aphids and red spiders in the cotton-growing areas of North China and Northeast China, prepare early, guide and organize the masses, prevent in advance, and eliminate them in time. This year, all cotton-growing areas in the country should strive to prevent major insect pests from becoming disasters.

　　In the past, the guidance of cotton planting technology has generally not been given enough attention. In the future, it is necessary to combine the experience of the masses with scientific technology, identify the main technologies that have a decisive effect on increasing production in the local area based on the actual problems existing in cotton planting in various places, and those that can be implemented by the general masses under existing conditions, such as seedling protection and transplanting technologies, and promote them through grassroots technical organizations such as village technical research groups and labor mutual aid groups.

　　Finally, in order to guarantee increased production, much work is still being done in terms of organizational leadership. People's governments at all levels must attach importance to the task of cotton production. The main cotton-producing areas should take the realization of the cotton planting plan as the central task throughout the year. It is necessary to carry out specific plans, specific deployments, and implement the cotton planting plan and the policy of rewarding cotton planting through various organizations, various meetings, and various methods. In-depth publicity and mobilization should be carried out among the broad masses to ensure that everyone knows about it and that cotton planting plans are automatically formulated by households and villages. After the plan is formulated, it must be seriously implemented for evaluation and inspection to urge the realization of the plan.

　　Secondly, leaders must grasp the seasonality of agriculture. Pay attention to doing a good job in the specific preparation work before cotton sowing, such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural tools, and land preparation, and pay special attention to grasping the leadership link of concentrated cotton sowing and seedling protection. In mid-April 1950, Hebei Province mobilized 15,000 cadres to participate in the concentrated cotton planting work. Members of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party personally went to the countryside to inspect, and many areas established cotton planting headquarters and joint offices of party and government propaganda departments, using telephones to discover problems and promote work in a timely manner; newspapers also concentrated propaganda efforts to promote cotton planting, which played a great role. In 1951, all localities should continue to carry forward this spirit.

　　Increasing cotton production is a complex and arduous task. Experience has shown that professional institutions and dedicated personnel are necessary for cotton production increase work. On the other hand, increasing cotton production is a major link in the entire national economic construction. It is not something that the agricultural sector can do well alone. It is necessary to strengthen the coordination and connection of relevant departments, and everyone must cooperate with each other in unified steps under a unified goal to achieve results.

　　In order to encourage cotton farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production, a patriotic bumper harvest movement for cotton planting should be launched. We should mobilize households and households, mutual aid groups and mutual aid groups, villages and villages... etc. to carry out challenge competitions for cotton planting and bumper harvests, creating an atmosphere where planting more cotton and having bumper harvests in cotton fields is an honor, and awarding prizes through the election of model workers and agricultural exhibitions. In 1950, my country has begun to produce many typical examples of bumper cotton harvests. The highest, such as the Handan Farm in Hebei Province, produced more than 600 catties of seed cotton per mu, exceeding the local general average yield by five times. Liuying Village in Shijiazhuang had an average seed cotton yield of nearly 300 catties per mu on all 1,300 mu of cotton fields, exceeding the average yield of Hebei Province by three times. There are many households with bumper harvests of more than 400 catties per mu. This is a new achievement in the history of cotton planting in China. In 1951, we must have greater achievements in this regard.

　　Increasing cotton production in 1951 is not only a major production task, but also a glorious political task. We must do everything possible to strive to complete—and to over-fulfill—this task!

　　怎样去完成今年棉花增产的重大任务？
    中央人民政府农业部副部长  杨显东
    我国棉花生产，过去在帝国主义与官僚资本的层层统制与剥削下，一直得不到发展。棉纺工业的原料，从来都依赖进口大量外棉来维持。输入的棉花，常占进口贸易货值的第一位或第二位。全国解放以后，一九五○年人民政府大力从事棉花增产，一年中即增产了百分之五十八点九，总产量超过了战前一九三三年至一九三七年五年平均产量的百分之十一，已大体能满足全国现有开工纱锭所需原料，基本上扭转了几十年来大量依赖外棉的形势。这是值得我们非常兴奋的。
    新中国人民对于纱布的需要是很大的。
    如以东北为例，东北农村的棉布销售量一年来变化很大，一九四七年仅销八○万匹，一九四八年增至一二○万匹，一九四九年增至三二○万匹，一九五○年增至一三○○万匹，三年增加了十六倍多。这说明了经过土地改革，发展生产，人民生活提高之后，对棉织品消费量是如何的巨大。
    由于棉花需要大量的激增，发展棉产，成为当前工农业建设上一个主要环节，一九五一年我们必须用一切可能的力量，使棉花生产迅速追上工业原料和人民日用的需要，达到棉花全部自给的目标。
    政务院“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中已指出棉花增产是一九五一年极为重要的一项任务，要在一九五○年的基础上尽量扩展棉田，提高单位面积产量，增产棉花百分之三十六点九。为了更充分的供应棉花需要，还要尽可能争取超额地完成上述任务。
    一九五一年的棉花增产任务很重大，完成任务时必然有许多困难。如棉区群众对政府的政策一时还不易完全了解；在比较集中的棉区，缺乏粮食、燃料、饲料等，在目前条件下，还未能充分合理的供应；自然灾害还很多，棉田产量还不能很好的保证；部分地区肥料、农具还很缺乏，新扩展的棉区以及灾区都欠缺棉种……等。因此，在今年生产时，就需要着重克服这一些困难。
    根据一九五○年的工作经验，要胜利完成一九五一年棉花增产任务，首先必须掌握奖励植棉的各项政策，而其中主要的又是必须保证合理的棉粮比价政策。棉花是商品生产，合理的棉粮比价与保证及时收购是发展棉产最主要的关键。一九五○年全国曾大力贯彻合理的棉粮比价政策，这个政策，保证种棉比种粮有利，因而大大刺激了棉花的增产。但一九五○年的棉粮比价公布稍迟，少数地区在执行中还有些偏差，未能使所有棉农都得到了保证价格的实际利益。为此，中央财政经济委员会已在一九五○年棉粮比价基础上，经过合理调整，定出了一九五一年的棉粮比价标准，不仅普遍提高了各地区的比价，而且肯定这是保证棉农在产地市集上实际所得的最低价格。不论任何季节，均不能低于此项比价标准。这是很坚决的保证棉价的政策，各地区应在春耕播种以前，即大力实行新定比价。同时也要正确执行等级差价的政策，即优棉优价，低棉低价的政策，以保障群众利益，提高棉花品质。
    在棉粮比价政策之外，应有重点地实行棉花预购或赊购的政策。一九五○年东北、平原的国营花纱布公司与合作社，以粮食、豆饼、煤炭等与棉农订立实物预购合同。山西潞城县合作社与棉农订立信用预购合同，棉农反映很好。他们说：“春订合同秋交花，看我种花不种花”。这是打消棉农顾虑和具体帮助棉农生产的有效办法。今年，在有条件的棉区，应通过合作社，大力开展预购或赊购的工作。
    此外，则应当贯彻奖励植棉的负担政策。农业税法上规定种棉多收入了，仍按粮田负担，一九五○年中央财政经济委员会又正式公布了以棉代交公粮的规定，各地均照此执行，这些决定又解除了棉农怕因种棉而多负担、和怕没粮食交公粮因而不敢多种棉花的顾虑，这，对扩展棉田，起了很大作用。但棉田集中区粮食欠缺，如果夏征交了粮，以后仍得买粮吃，群众还感到不便，因此，政务院“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中已规定：“棉农的农业负担得于秋后一次征收。”以便利农民。
    奖励种棉的政策决定之后，还应当采取一些实际支持这些政策的办法。
    政务院“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中提出：“为了提高棉田单位面积的生产量，必须注意及时灌溉排水，供给肥料和防治病虫害的药械”。因此，产棉为主的省区，应将兴办水利的资力和能掌握的科学治虫药械，尽先供应棉区的需要。此外，各地应结合贸易、合作、银行等部门有计划地大力进行下列三项经济工作：（一）大量补充棉区肥料农具等生产资料的不足；（二）供应棉区食粮及日用必需品，在可能范围内并应调剂燃料饲料等的不足；（三）对缺种地区应实行调剂棉种。
    在调剂棉种方面，一九五○年曾空前地调剂了一亿零六百五十万斤棉籽，解决了六、七百万亩棉田缺种的困难。但一九五○年的种籽调剂工作，也发生很多错误，有些并且造成了重大的损失。主要的错误在于对缺种情况未作正确估计，盲目进行调剂，或实行大量远程的调运，对选种、收购、运输、贷发一系列的细密组织工作未做好，因而发生有些发芽率太差等现象。一九五一年在这方面避免重蹈覆辙。
    至于在棉农方面，今年则应开展群众性的提高植棉技术的运动。
    加强植棉技术指导，开展群众性的改良棉种、防治病虫和提高耕作技术，是增进棉田单位面积产量的主要环节。棉种改良一定要建立在广大群众继续不断的选种基础上，尤其是播种前的粒选，简单易行，可普遍推行。棉花良种的推广，一九五○年已达到一○四七万亩，一九五一年要求扩大推广繁殖到一九○○万亩。应有步骤地实施五年普及良种计划。
    棉花的自然灾害以虫害最为普遍。一九五一年各地应尽量利用国产农药，发扬土法防治，针对其主要发生的虫害，如华北和东北棉区的棉蚜和红蜘蛛，采取有效措施，及早准备，指导和组织群众，事先预防，及时除治。今年，应要求全国棉区大力争取不使主要虫害成灾。
    过去，对于植棉技术的指导，一般都重视得不够。今后必须在总结群众经验与科学技术相结合的基础上，针对各地植棉实际存在的问题，找出当地对增产具有决定作用的几项主要技术，并为现有条件下一般群众所能实施的，如保苗移苗等技术，通过基层技术组织如乡村的技术研究小组，劳动互助组等，加以推广。
    最后，为了保证增产，在组织领导方面，还在作许多工作。各级人民政府必须重视棉产任务，主要产棉区应把实现植棉计划作为贯串全年的中心任务。要进行具体计划，具体布置，通过各种组织，各种会议，各种方式把植棉计划和奖励植棉的政策贯彻下去。对广大群众应进行深入的宣传动员，做到家喻户晓，做到按户按村自动地订立植棉计划。计划订立之后，要认真实行评比检查，以督促计划的实现。
    其次，领导必须掌握农业的季节性。注意做好棉花播种前的种籽、肥料、农药、农具、整地等具体准备工作，并要特别抓紧突击播棉与保苗的领导环节。一九五○年河北省曾于四月中旬，动员一万五千干部参加突击植棉工作，中国共产党河北省党委会委员曾亲自下乡检查，许多地区成立了植棉指挥部，以及党政宣传部门的联合办公室，利用电话及时发现问题，推进工作；报纸亦集中宣传力量，推动植棉起了很大作用。一九五一年各地应继续发扬这样的精神。
    棉花增产是一个复杂而艰巨的任务。经验证明，专业机构和专人管理，对棉花增产工作是必要的。另一方面，棉花增产是国家整个经济建设中主要的一环，不是农业部门单独能做得好的，必须加强有关部门的配合联系，大家在统一目标下，齐一步调，互相配合，才能收到效果。
    为了鼓舞棉农增产的热情，应当开展一个植棉的爱国丰产运动。应当发动户与户、互助组与互助组、村与村……等进行植棉丰产的挑战竞赛，造成一种以多种棉花和棉田丰产为光荣的风气，并通过选举劳动模范与农业展览等，予以评奖。一九五○年我国已开始产生了不少的植棉丰产的典型，最高的如河北省邯郸农场，每亩产籽棉六百多斤，超过当地一般平均产量的五倍。石家庄留营村，全村一三○○亩棉田，平均每亩籽棉产量近三百斤，超过河北省平均产量的三倍。每亩收到四百斤以上的丰产户为数很多，这是中国植棉历史上新的成就。一九五一年要在这方面有更大的成就。
    一九五一年的棉花增产不仅是一个重大的生产任务，而且是一个光荣的政治任务，我们必须尽一切可能的力量，为了完成——并且要超额完成——这一任务而奋斗！
