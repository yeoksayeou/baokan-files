　　Nanjing, Lüda and Other Cities
    Establish Reporter System

　　Since the Central Committee of the Party promulgated the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses of People Throughout the Party," a few large cities have successively established a city-level Party reporter system. In some areas, reporters have already begun work. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has appointed 57 comrades, including Ke Qingshi, Jiang Weiqing, Qiu Yihan, and Shi Ximin, as city-level reporters. The Lüda Municipal Committee has appointed 49 comrades, including Ouyang Qin, Han Guang, Guo Shushen, and Ren Zhongyi, as city-level reporters. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee has appointed 111 comrades, including Han Chunde, Yu Lin, and Wang Daren, as city-level reporters. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee has appointed 41 comrades, including Mao Duo, Wei Shizhen, Zang Boping, and Feng Yunfu, as city-level reporters. The reporters in the above cities are all Party secretaries and members of the city and district levels, as well as Party members holding responsible positions in the city and district level People's Governments and mass organizations. The Party committees of each city have also determined the tasks and work systems of the reporters. It has generally been determined that reporters should give a political report to the people's masses directly connected with them at least once every two months. In addition, it is stipulated that they should provide a briefing or answer questions to the propagandists of the units assigned to them every half month. It is also stipulated that the reports made by the reporters should be based on the content of the propaganda manual or the unified report outline, combined with the masses' ideological and work situation and vivid examples personally investigated by each person, to formulate each person's report outline, and finally submitted to the Party committee of the unit for review and approval.
