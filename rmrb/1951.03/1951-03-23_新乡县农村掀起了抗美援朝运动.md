    Anti-American and Aid Korea Movement Sweeps Xinxiang County's Rural Areas
    Hao Mingfu
    Xinxiang County, Pingyuan Province, carried out land reform in the winter of 1949, but because the masses were not fully mobilized, the village organizations were not pure, and the reactionary foundation of the landlord class was not thoroughly destroyed, the land rights in many villages were not determined. Therefore, the results of the land reform were not very solid. Some people thought that land that didn't cost money to farm was farmed for a year at a time, and when allocated houses and land, landlords didn't give them and they didn't dare to ask for them. This made it easier for illegal landlords and other counter-revolutionaries to carry out counter-revolutionary activities such as spreading rumors, sabotage, threats, and enticement. As U.S. imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea and occupied our country's Taiwan by force, illegal landlords began to stir and settle accounts with the peasants. Some people, not understanding the situation, worried about "the change of heaven." According to statistics from 207 administrative villages in the county, 178 villages had incidents of settling accounts, accounting for 85.8 percent of all villages. Illegal landlords and old-style rich peasants who settled accounts, as far as is known, accounted for 46.3 percent of all landlords and old-style rich peasants. In Xiaoji Town, where the county government is located, 28 out of 88 landlord households also settled accounts. In Wangtun in the Fourth District, none of the 13 landlord and old-style rich peasant households failed to settle accounts. Many illegal landlords and old-style rich peasants, and even some reactionaries, were preparing to shoot village cadres "in the back."
    Reactionary landlords were completely in cahoots with U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang spies, under the command of U.S. imperialism, carried out rumor-mongering and sabotage activities, endangering the country and the people. The masses could not tolerate this situation. The masses reflected: if the landlords' ferocity is not suppressed, we won't be able to live. The masses in Chaocun in the Fourth District tied up a landlord who was settling accounts and sent him to the district. However, some people, fearing "the change of heaven," had low morale in production and even ate and drank excessively. For example, peasants in Licun in the Fifth District ate more than 800 catties of flour and vegetables in half a month on Bandao Street. The broad masses urgently demanded to "understand the bottom line of the situation," to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and to deal with landlords who were settling accounts.
    After the leaders explained the current situation from top to bottom through various meetings, and mobilized the masses from bottom to top to make accusations, and carried out various current affairs propaganda, the political awareness of the masses was greatly improved.
    First, the illusions of some people about U.S. imperialism were eliminated, and a concept of hatred for the U.S. was established. From the various sabotage activities carried out by illegal landlords and other counter-revolutionaries in the countryside, linked to U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and occupation of Taiwan, from accusing the past atrocities of Japanese invaders against China, linked to U.S. imperialism today taking the old path of Japan, and being the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, the hatred of the masses for U.S. imperialism was aroused. The masses reflected: why does U.S. imperialism help Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee? Why do reactionary landlords and old-style rich peasants spread rumors and sabotage and settle accounts when U.S. imperialism invades Korea and Taiwan? From this, they realized that "the root of reactionary landlords is rooted in Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek's root is rooted in U.S. imperialism," just like a tree, when the root moves, the treetop sways. They also realized that "the people of the world are one family, and the reactionaries of the world are a small handful. If U.S. imperialism is not defeated, we won't have a good time." Some individual peasants said: "U.S. imperialism used to be good, giving relief supplies, but now it has turned bad." Others criticized: American relief supplies are like the scented bait on a fishing hook, trying to get us to bite, so that we will obediently be oppressed. Still others said: "Building churches and doing business is followed by cannons and machine guns." Many people accused U.S. imperialism of its crimes. Li Zhaohui of Matou Village in the Fifth District said: "Since the Liberation Army came, we have been allocated land and houses, and our family has had food and clothing. Today, U.S. imperialism is invading Korea, bombing the Northeast, and occupying Taiwan. The Japanese devils raped women, burned, and killed in our village in the past, and we have suffered enough as slaves. We don't want to be slaves a second time. I demand to go to Korea to participate in the war and fight the American devils."
    Second, from fearing U.S. imperialism to firming up confidence in victory. Originally, there was a "fear of the U.S." among the masses, overestimating the enemy's strength and having a purely weapon-based view. After analyzing the victory in the Korean War, they realized that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. Reactionary landlords spread rumors saying "America is terrible." The masses refuted: "A rabbit's tail won't grow long. American soldiers don't want to fight, they are as useless as Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers, and they rape, burn, and kill everywhere like the Japanese devils, and they won't escape destruction." The masses also remembered clearly that "the first time they eliminated 13,000, the second time they eliminated more than 34,000, the third time they eliminated 13,000. Three soldiers of the American troops invading Korea are already finished." In this way, they gradually overcame their fear of the U.S. and inferiority complex, and enhanced their national self-esteem and self-confidence.
    Third, from narrow nationalism to internationalism. Because in the past "Goryeo sticks," those imperialist lackeys like Syngman Rhee, had helped the Japanese devils fight us, some people could not strictly distinguish the Korean people from them, so they said: "Anti-Americanism should not aid Korea." But from U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and bombing of our Northeast, after understanding the relationship between China and Korea, the masses reflected: "Helping your neighbor fight off robbers is also for your own sake; if we don't help fight, they will rob our house," "U.S. imperialism is like a wolf, if it eats Korea, it will eat China," "We can't compromise with U.S. imperialism, just like we can't compromise with the counter-revolutionaries in our village. The more afraid you are, the more the wolf will scare you; the less afraid you are, the bolder you will be." Therefore, many young people volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the war, and demonstrated patriotism and internationalism, donating money to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and to help Korean refugees. The total amount of donations has reached more than 50 million yuan. Yangxing Village in the Fourth District donated 784,000 yuan in RMB, 221 catties of millet, 294 catties of wheat, 288 catties of corn, and 55 catties of cotton.
    Fourth, compare the past with today and love the great motherland. Starting with summarizing a year of production and comparing the past suffering with the good times of today, the masses' love for the motherland was further stimulated, and their fighting spirit was increased. For example, Ding Taizu, a peasant in Qiliying, said: "This year's harvest is good, especially cotton is profitable. My family of three has ten mu of land and planted five mu and five fen of cotton. We harvested forty-two jin per mu, bought a big cart, and renovated our three eastern rooms, and had a happy New Year." Peasants in Yanmiao said: "Looking back, the Japanese, the Kuomintang, and the landlords burned, killed, and raped, making it impossible to live. We won't be able to live if the Americans come either."
    From this, the masses more deeply experienced that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government can there be good times, and they must never let U.S. imperialism come and take away this good life again.
    Fifth, from "not asking about world affairs and closing the door to focus on production" to opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and consolidating national defense. Originally, many people thought that "U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, it's nothing" and "Korea is far away." After exposing the U.S. imperialist plot of aggression and the masses accusing the Japanese of their atrocities, the masses not only recognized the lovability of the motherland, but also realized that they had a duty to defend this revolutionary fruit. Wang Changke of Langgongmiao in the Fifth District said: "I can never forget the brutal rule of the Japanese and the Kuomintang. U.S. imperialism is even more terrible than the Japanese and the Kuomintang. If we don't defend it, the enemy won't let us have a good life. Imperialism is still standing outside the gate. I love my motherland and my home. I want to join the Volunteer Army." After understanding the situation, a village party branch secretary in the Third District said: "I only thought about organizing and developing production, and that everything was peaceful. Who knew things were so big? I have to rectify the branch when I go back, strengthen the concept of the enemy's situation, and take good care of those lackeys of the United States here." Many people realized that it was necessary to strengthen national defense and asked to join the people's armed forces.
    After studying and understanding the situation, the party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and district and village cadres in the county returned to the villages to convey the situation and policies. The masses were relieved of their ideological worries. Encouraged by the victory on the Korean front, and with the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries by the People's Government correcting the deviation of "unlimited leniency," they actively cooperated with the People's Government to vigorously suppress the reactionary landlords' behavior of settling accounts. In the past, peasants said: "What's the use of talking if you can't do anything and can't relieve your hatred?" Now they say: "The Korean front is fighting the American devils, and we are digging up their small roots here, attacking them from both sides and defeating them completely." All localities, focusing on key villages, held mass meetings to celebrate the great victory on the Korean front, and carried out joint struggles against counter-revolutionaries in the area. By early February, the county had organized joint struggle meetings in six districts, divided into 32 areas, with the participation of 207 villages and more than 87,000 people. Each mass meeting was attended by more than 2,000 people. The masses began to accuse one by one, and soon used suffering to evoke suffering, competing to accuse. The masses were truly justified and carried out fierce reasoning struggles face to face. The leading organs, in accordance with the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, dealt with them separately according to the size of their crimes. The masses reflected: landlords and rich peasants no longer dare to make trouble. The distinction between the enemy and us is clearer than before. After suppressing the settlement of accounts, the masses also demanded control. Generally, they reported once every three to seven days, and signed agreements to hand over all the settled accounts, and guaranteed not to spread rumors or carry out sabotage activities, and honestly engage in labor reform. In this way, the reactionary arrogance of the landlords was completely suppressed. According to statistics from 178 villages, a total of 728.2 mu of land, 1,512 rooms, 209 livestock, 95 large carts, and 496 major agricultural implements were recovered. 697 trees and 224 dan of grain were recovered, and 89 landlords who had escaped the net were found.
    In addition, 20 villages also carried out the work of eliminating bandits and banning secret societies, detaining eight leaders, registering 1,040 leaders and followers, arresting 17 habitual bandits, and confiscating 13 rifles and pistols and 25 bullets. Since then, rural order has been further consolidated.
    After this anti-American and aid Korea movement, the masses and village cadres had two experiences: first, counter-revolutionaries must be struggled against, and the people's democratic dictatorship must be implemented so that they can be honest. The masses in Dajieshan said: we suffered when we didn't separate from the landlords during the land reform the year before last. Village cadres in Xiaosongfu Village said: "The landlords in our village didn't dare to settle accounts because we mastered two things: one is that we were united and didn't let bad people take advantage of us; the other is that we controlled the armed forces. Our militia is very useful and has solved three cases of sabotage and theft. Bad people don't dare to move." Second, carrying out the anti-American and aid Korea movement makes all work go well. Village cadres in Fengleli Village said: after the anti-American and aid Korea propaganda and the suppression of landlords settling accounts, the masses actively paid public grain. The masses demanded to consolidate and develop their various organizations, strengthen public security, and arm themselves to defend the fruits of their liberation.
    After the masses drew a clear line with illegal landlords, old-style rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, they made four evaluations of the village cadres (evaluate their position, evaluate their thinking, evaluate their achievements, and evaluate their work style), which strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and strengthened the sense of responsibility of the village cadres. Many village cadres who helped reactionary landlords and old-style rich peasants settle accounts, or who knew about it and did nothing, admitted their mistakes to the masses, expressed their attitude, severed ties with the landlords and old-style rich peasants, and actively started working. A group of hooligans and bad elements were replaced.
    At the same time, the masses actively participated in various organizations and joined the people's armed forces. They said: "In the past, the landlords controlled us with guns, but now we will control the landlords with guns." Women's representative meetings were established in 23 villages, and people's representative meetings were established in 24 villages. 1,370 activists in the anti-American and aid Korea movement emerged, further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. In the movement, party propagandists began to be established. According to statistics from eight villages around Xiaoji, there are already 17 propagandists. Each village also generally established a propaganda joint meeting, added two hours of current affairs classes to the winter schools, organized reading groups, and used blackboards and broadcasting tubes for current affairs propaganda. During the Spring Festival, a large-scale cultural and recreational propaganda campaign was launched. On February 8th, more than 30,000 people from more than ten administrative villages in the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts held a cultural and recreational propaganda activity competition in Xiaoji.
    Summarizing the previous stage of the anti-American and aid Korea movement to defend the country, the achievements are great, but in the future, the patriotic movement of anti-American and aid Korea and opposing the U.S. imperialism arming Japan must be made more popular and in-depth.

    新乡县农村掀起了抗美援朝运动
    郝明甫
    平原省新乡县是在一九四九年冬季进行土地改革的，但是由于群众发动不充分，村组织不纯，地主阶级的反动基础未彻底摧毁，不少村地权未确定，因而土地改革的成果不十分巩固。部分群众认为没花钱种的地，种一年是一年，分给的房子和地，地主不给，自己不敢要。这样，就便利了不法地主等反革命分子进行造谣破坏、威胁利诱等反革命活动。随着美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争，武装占领我国台湾后，不法地主即开始蠢动，向农民进行倒算。部分群众则因不了解形势，产生了“变天”顾虑。据全县二百零七个行政村的统计，有一百七十八个村有倒算事件，占全部村的百分之八十五点八，进行倒算的不法地主与旧式富农，据已知者，占全部地主、旧式富农的百分之四十六点三。小冀镇是县机关驻地，八十八户地主中，也有二十八户进行了倒算。四区王屯十三户地主与旧式富农，没有一户不倒算的。不少不法地主与旧式富农，甚至还有反动分子准备打村干部的“黑枪”。
    反动地主与美帝国主义、蒋介石完全是一鼻孔出气，蒋介石匪帮特务们在美帝国主义的指挥下，进行造谣破坏活动，危害国家和人民。群众对于这种情况，是无法容忍的。群众反映：地主的凶焰不压压，就没有我们过的了。四区晁村群众把倒算地主捆起来送到区里。但也有部分群众因怕“变天”，生产情绪低落，甚至大吃大喝，如五区李村农民，半道街半个月吃粉菜八百余斤。广大群众迫切要求“蹬蹬形势的底”，镇压反革命分子，处理倒算地主。
    经过领导上通过各种会议，自上而下地讲解时事形势，与自下而上地发动群众进行控诉，并进行了各种时事宣传以后，群众的政治觉悟大为提高。
    首先是消除了某些人对美帝国主义的幻想，树立了仇美的观念。从农村不法地主等反革命分子进行各种的破坏活动，联系到美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，占领我台湾，从控诉过去日寇侵略中国的暴行，联系到美帝国主义今天正在走日本的老路，是中国人民的死敌后，激发了群众对美帝国主义的仇恨。群众反映：美帝国主义为什么帮助蒋介石，又帮助李承晚呢？为什么反动地主、旧式富农在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾的时候造谣破坏，进行倒算呢？从这里认识了“反动地主的根，是扎在蒋介石那里，蒋介石的根又扎在美帝国主义那里”，就好像一棵树一样，根一动，树梢就幌动。又认识到“天下人民是一家，天下反动派是一小撮。美帝国主义打不倒，时光就过不好。”有个别的农民说：“美帝国主义以前好，给救济物资，现在变坏了。”别的人就批评说：美国救济物资和钓鱼钩上的香饵一样，是叫我们上它的钩，好叫咱服服贴贴地受压迫。更有的人说：“办教堂，来经商，后面跟着大炮机关枪。”不少群众对美帝国主义的罪恶进行了控诉。五区马头村李朝会说：“自从解放军来到，我们才分了土地房屋，我们家才有吃有穿；今天美帝国主义又侵略朝鲜，轰炸东北，占领台湾。过去日本鬼子在俺村强奸妇女，大烧大杀，我们当亡国奴已经当够了，我们不愿意二次当亡国奴，我要求赴朝鲜参战，打美国鬼子。”
    第二、由对美帝国主义存在恐惧到坚定了胜利信心。原先群众中存在着“恐美病”，过高估计敌人力量，有唯武器论的想法。经过分析朝鲜战争的胜利后，认识了美帝国主义是纸老虎。反动地主造谣说“美国不得了。”群众驳斥说：“兔子尾巴长不了，美国当兵的都不愿打仗，和蒋介石的兵一样不顶打，和日本鬼子一样到处奸淫烧杀，不会不完蛋。”群众并记清了“第一次消灭一万三，第二次消灭三万四千多，第三次消灭一万三，三次消灭六万多，美国侵朝的军队，三个兵已完了一个。”这样，逐步克服了恐美思想与自卑心，提高了民族自尊心与自信心。
    第三、由狭隘的民族主义到国际主义。由于过去“高丽棒子”，那些像李承晚一样的帝国主义走狗，曾帮助过日本鬼子打过我们，部分群众不能把朝鲜人民与他们严格区别开来，因此说：“抗美不应该援朝”。但从美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，轰炸我东北，认识了中朝关系后，群众反映：“邻人打强盗，也是为的咱；咱不帮着打，就抢到咱们家里来了”，“美帝国主义像一只狼，吃了朝鲜就吃中国”，“对美帝国主义和对本村的反革命分子一样，不能妥协，越骇怕，狼来吓，越不怕，胆越大”，因此不少青壮年自动报名要求赴朝参战，并发挥了爱国主义与国际主义精神，捐款慰问中朝人民战士、救济朝鲜难民。现捐款总数已达五千余万元。四区杨兴村一个村就捐了人民币七十八万四千元，小米二百二十一斤，小麦二百九十四斤，玉子二百八十八斤，棉花五十五斤。
    第四、比过去，看今天，热爱伟大的祖国。从总结一年生产入手，比较过去的苦难，和今天的好时光，更加激发了群众对祖国的热爱，增加了斗志。如七里营农民丁太祖说：“今年丰收，特别是棉花有利，我三人十亩地，种了五亩五分棉花，每亩收到四十二斤，买了个大车，又把三间东房翻盖一新，痛痛快快地过了个新年。”阎庙农民说：“回头想一想，日本人、国民党、地主烧杀奸淫没法活。美国来了也没有我们过的。”
    从这里，群众更深深体验到，只有共产党和人民政府的领导，才有好时光，决不能再让美帝国主义再来夺去这个好日子。
    第五、由“不问天下事，关门闹生产”，到反对美帝国主义侵略，巩固国防。原先不少群众认为“美帝国主义是纸老虎，没啥”、“朝鲜远着哩”。经过揭发美帝国主义侵略阴谋与群众控诉日寇的暴行后，使群众不但认识了祖国的可爱，而且认识到自己有义务来保卫这个革命果实。五区郎公庙王长轲说：“我过去受日本、国民党的残暴统治，一辈子也忘不了，美帝国主义过来，比日本、国民党更厉害，咱不来保卫，敌人不会让我们过好日子。帝国主义还站在大门外呢，我爱祖国，爱自己的家，我要求参加志愿军。”三区一个村支部书记在了解形势后说：“我只当组织起来发展生产，太平无事，谁知道事情还有这么大，回去可得整顿一下支部，加强敌情观念，好好管管美国在咱这里的这些狗腿。”不少群众认清了必须壮大国防力量，纷纷要求参加人民武装。
    全县的党员、团员、区、村干部，经过学习摸了底，回村传达了形势政策后，群众解除了思想顾虑，在朝鲜前线胜利鼓舞下，在人民政府纠正“宽大无边”偏向坚决镇压反革命的情况下，就积极配合人民政府，大力镇压了反动地主的倒算行为。过去农民说：“办不了事，解不了恨，说那干啥？”现在说：“朝鲜前线打美国鬼子，咱在这里刨它的小根，前后夹攻，打它个落花流水。”各地都以重点村为主，开群众大会，庆祝朝鲜前线大捷，对反革命分子进行了片村联合斗争。到二月初，全县在六个区，分三十二片，组织了联合斗争会，参加的有二百零七个村，八万七千余人。每一次群众会，到会的人数都在二千以上。群众开始一个一个地控诉，很快就以苦引苦，争着控诉。群众真是理直气壮，面对面进行着激烈的说理斗争。领导机关按照镇压反革命的政策，根据罪恶大小，均分别予以处理。群众反映：地主富农再也不敢风吹草动了。敌我界限比过去划的清了。群众在镇压了倒算后，还要求进行管制。一般三天到七天汇报一次，并具结全部交出倒算财物，保证不再造谣，进行破坏活动，老老实实劳动改造。这样便把地主反动气焰彻底打了下去。据一七八个村的统计，共收回倒算土地七百二十八点二亩，房一千五百十二间，牲畜二百○九头，大车九十五辆，主要农具四百九十六件。树木六百九十七棵，粮食二百二十四石，查出漏网地主八十九户。
    除此之外，有二十个村又进行了肃清土匪、取缔会道门工作，扣押道首八名，登记道首、道徒一千零四十人，捕惯匪十七人，缴出长短枪十三支，子弹二十五粒。自此，农村秩序得到进一步巩固。
    群众和村干部经过这次抗美援朝运动后，有两点体验：第一，对反革命分子必须斗争，必须实行人民民主专政，他们才能老实。大介山群众说：前年土地改革时，没和地主分开家，吃了亏。小宋佛村村干部说：“俺村地主没敢倒算，是掌握了两条：一条是自己团结，不叫坏人钻空子；一条是掌握武装，俺村民兵很管用，破了三起破坏偷盗案，坏人都不敢动了。”第二，开展抗美援朝运动，啥工作都做好了。丰乐里村干说：经过抗美援朝宣传和镇压地主倒算以后，群众均踊跃缴纳公粮。群众要求巩固发展自己的各种组织，加强治安，武装起来保卫翻身果实。
    群众在和不法地主、旧式富农、反革命分子划清界限后，对村干部提出四评（评立场、评思想、评成绩、评作风），密切了干部和群众的关系，加强了村干部的责任感。不少帮助反动地主、旧式富农倒算，或知道而不管的村干部，向群众承认了错误，表明态度，和地主、旧式富农割断联系，积极地干起来。一部分流氓、坏分子则加以撤换。
    同时，群众积极参加各种组织，参加人民武装。他们说：“以前地主拿枪管咱，现在咱要拿枪管地主。”全县建立了二十三个村的妇女代表会，二十四个村的人民代表会，涌现了一千三百七十个抗美援朝运动的积极分子，进一步巩固了人民民主专政。在运动中，又开始建立了党的宣传员，据小冀周围八个村统计，已有十七个宣传员。各村还普遍建立了宣传联席会，在冬学民校中，每星期加上了二小时的时事课，组织读报组，运用黑板报、广播筒进行时事宣传。在春节期间，又展开了大规模的文娱宣传活动。二月八日，三、四、五区十多个行政村三万多群众，在小冀举行了文娱宣传活动竞赛。
    总结上一段抗美援朝保家卫国运动，成绩是很大的，但今后必须使抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义武装日本的爱国运动，更加普及和深入。
