　　Contending for Wartime Preparedness Profits
    Truman's Corruption Exposed
    Democrats and Republicans Argue Over This
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch] Washington News: The U.S. Senate Banking Subcommittee, while investigating the fraud case of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), a U.S. government lending institution, proved that even U.S. President Truman himself was complicit in the corruption. This is one of many scandals of U.S. government officials engaging in corruption for personal gain that have been continuously exposed amid the current frenzy among U.S. capitalists to grab wartime preparedness profits and the uneven distribution of spoils.
    The Senate Banking Subcommittee invited many people to testify during the investigation of the RFC fraud case. RFC director, Detroit's wealthy banker Dunham, revealed in his testimony that Truman had directly facilitated a $12 million loan from the RFC to the Collard Company of Boston. Truman was also related to the RFC's loan to a Louisiana hotel; his friend Major Yore was connected to the hotel. Dunham also revealed a corruption case involving Truman's political confidant, former U.S. Compensation Commission member Bowles. This incident arose because of the authorization for Bowles's "Pacific Rubber Company" to manufacture synthetic rubber for the RFC; this "contract" was signed at the request of the Democratic National Committee.
    After the Senate Banking Subcommittee launched its investigation, Truman, feeling guilty, coerced the subcommittee to stop the investigation, but failed. U.S. newspapers then published these scandals extensively, and published more and more editorials and cartoons to attack them. Truman was forced to make a public denial at a press conference on the 15th. He said, "My government has always been clean." However, Truman's denial was merely a clumsy attempt to cover up the truth. The U.S. Republican Party has seized upon this case to launch a massive attack on the Democratic government. Republican Senator Taft said on the 17th that the Truman administration was "politically immoral" and that "despite Congress's exposure, the bribe-taking, self-serving guys are still doing their thing." Former Republican National Committee Chairman and Congressman Scott said on the same day, referring to the RFC case: "In this place called Washington, half the people are waiting to be exposed, and the other half are afraid they will be exposed."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch] According to TASS, New York, 18th dispatch: While Truman insisted at a press conference that all of his White House attendants were "noble figures beyond reproach," the U.S. Senate has become the scene of fierce debate surrounding the RFC fraud case, with Truman's aides, his other close friends, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Boyle all implicated in the case.
    Republican senators demanded the immediate abolition of the RFC and a full investigation of past illegal activities during the liquidation period. Democratic senators used counter-accusations to try to defend the Truman administration. They pointed out that Republicans also gained political and financial benefits from the RFC. Democratic Senator Douglas pointed out that Republican National Committee Chairman Gabrielson had obtained a loan of $18.5 million from the RFC for the Carthage Hydroelectric Company (where he served as chairman of the board). The RFC had given a loan of $10.01 million to the Taxmas Oil Company, and the Massachusetts insurance companies and banks controlled by Gabrielson had benefited from this loan. Senate Banking Subcommittee Chairman Fulbright also accused the Republicans of trying to prolong the investigation of the RFC fraud case "until the eve of the 1952 election, because the investigation would expose some scandals."
    On the other hand, Republican Senator Brick said that only if White House aides and Democratic National Committee Chairman Boyle himself were forced to confess would these "disgusting, base things that even Mr. Truman cannot ignore" be exposed, otherwise the investigation would be incomplete.
    At the same time, House Republicans exposed another corruption case—a case related to the Pentagon. The House Administrative Expenses Subcommittee asked officials from the State Department and the Department of Commerce to explain why merchants were allowed to resell surplus military supplies purchased from Germany to the U.S. government, thereby making huge profits. Army Secretary Pace admitted in testimony before this subcommittee that the U.S. Army "probably" repurchased some of its own military supplies and resold them in the United States for high profits.

　　争夺备战利润
    杜鲁门舞弊被揭发
    民主党共和党为此互相争吵
    【新华社二十一日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参院银行小组委员会在调查美国政府贷款机构复兴银公司的舞弊案件中，证明连美国总统杜鲁门本人也是串通作弊的一分子。这是在目前美国资本家疯狂争夺备战利润而分赃不均的情况下，连续被揭发出来的许多件美国政府官员营私舞弊丑事中的一件。
    参院银行小组委员会在调查复兴银公司舞弊案件中，邀请了许多人出席作证。复兴银公司董事、底特律富有的银行家顿翰姆在作证中泄露，杜鲁门曾直接为波士顿的加拉德向复兴银公司贷款一千二百万美元。杜鲁门又与复兴银公司贷款给路易斯安那旅馆一事有关，他的朋友约尔少校是与这家旅馆有关系的。顿翰姆又泄露杜鲁门在政治上的宠信、前美国赔偿委员会委员鲍莱的一项舞弊事件。这一事件是由于授权鲍莱所有的“太平洋橡胶公司”为复兴银公司制造人造橡胶所引起的，这个“合同”是根据民主党全国委员会的要求签订的。
    在参院银行小组委员会展开调查后，作贼心虚的杜鲁门即曾胁迫小组委员会停止调查工作，但未能成功。美国报纸遂大量地刊载了这些丑事，并发表越来越多的社论及漫画加以攻讦。杜鲁门被迫在十五日的记者招待会上作公开的抵赖。他说：“我的政府一直是廉洁的。”但是，杜鲁门的这种抵赖不过是欲盖弥彰。美国共和党已经抓住这个案件对民主党政府大肆攻击。共和党重要参议员塔夫脱在十七日说：杜鲁门政府“在政治上不道德”，“尽管国会在揭发，受贿营私的家伙仍在干他们的勾当”。前共和党全国委员会主席、众议员斯高特同日在谈到复兴银公司案件时也说：“在华盛顿这个地方，有一半人在等着被人揭发，另外一半人害怕他们被人揭发。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：当杜鲁门在记者招待会上坚称他的白宫的一切侍从们都是“不应受谴责的高尚人物”时，美国参院已成为围绕着复兴银公司舞弊案的激烈辩论的场所，杜鲁门的助手和他的其他密友以及民主党全国委员会主席鲍埃尔，都牵连在这个案子中。
    共和党的参议员要求立即取消复兴银公司，并在清算结束期间全盘调查过去的非法行为。民主党的参议员用反揭发的方法，竭力替杜鲁门政府辩护。他们指出，共和党人也从复兴银公司获得政治上和金融上的利益。民主党参议员道格拉斯指出：共和党全国委员会主席加布里埃尔逊曾为迦太基水力公司（他担任该公司的董事长）自复兴银公司得到一千八百五十万美元的贷款。复兴银公司曾给与塔克斯马斯石油公司以一千零十万美元的贷款，而加布里埃尔逊控制下的马萨诸塞州的各保险公司和银行曾从这笔贷款中得到了利益。参院银行小组委员会主席福尔布莱特也指责共和党人力图把调查复兴银公司舞弊案的时间一直延长“到一九五二年大选的前夕，因为调查会揭发一些丑事”。
    另一方面，共和党参议员布瑞克则称：只有白宫的助手和民主党全国委员会主席鲍埃尔自己被迫招供，才会“揭穿就连杜鲁门先生也不能置之不理的这些使人厌恶的下流事情”，否则调查是不完整的。
    与此同时，众院的共和党人又揭发了另一件贪污案——这是与五角大楼有关的一个案件。众院行政经费小组委员会要国务院和商务部的官员说明，为什么允许商人把他们从德国购买到的剩余军事物资转卖给美国政府，而从中获得巨额利润。陆军部长佩斯在这个小组委员会作证时承认，美国陆军“大概”重新买回了它自己的若干军用物资，并且又在美国重新售出而获得了高额利润。
