　　Regarding the reader criticisms of continuous mountain fires and forest destruction incidents in Linfen Special District, Shanxi Province, published in the January 27th edition of this newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column by readers Jia Maoting and Zhang Yifu, we have subsequently received letters from Wang Guoxiang, Shi Xirong, Li Qingyong, Chen Zhenhua, Lin Chen, Zhao Su, Wang Pengju, Sun Zhong, Lin Xinwan, Zhang Wei and other readers. Among these, aside from a few letters praising forest protection models (some of which have been published, see this newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column on February 12th and 24th), these readers raised criticisms and suggestions regarding the lack of attention to forest protection in areas such as Yanqing County, Chahar Province; Fuding County, Fujian Province; Jiangning County, Southern Jiangsu; and Changping County, Hebei Province. Reader Sun Zhong pointed out in his letter that Chahar Province only emphasizes afforestation but does not pay attention to forest protection. His letter stated: "Chahar Province is working very hard on afforestation. According to statistics from the provincial government, more than 90.094 million trees were planted in 1950; however, because some areas have not universally and deeply launched a mass movement to protect forests, the masses do not understand the importance of protecting trees. Therefore, incidents of mountain fires and forest destruction or illegal logging continue to occur in counties such as Yangyuan, Yu County, Huai'an, Yanggao, Zhuolu, and Yanqing. Although I cannot yet know the total number of trees destroyed in various places; however, judging from certain areas, the damaged trees are no less than the number of trees planted." We believe this is a common and serious phenomenon. The lesson of only advocating afforestation without paying attention to forest protection must be taken seriously by people's governments at all levels.

　　To protect the mountains and forests, we must rely on the masses and launch a mass movement to protect the mountains and forests. Reader Zhao Su's letter from Songjiang Province also proves this point. Songjiang Province achieved success in forest protection work last year, and its main experience is: launching a mass forest protection movement in mountainous and forest areas. The ten counties in the province's forest area have all established forestry sections, and have successively absorbed 850 activists to serve as forest rangers, organized 450 forest protection teams, held short-term forest protection training classes, and established 44 fire alarm watchtowers, so that forest protection work has a broad organization; in addition, through commending forest protection models, it has further improved the awareness and enthusiasm of the masses in the forest area for protecting mountains and forests. Therefore, few incidents of mountain fires and forest destruction occurred in the province last year.

　　The tree planting season is approaching, and various places are actively preparing to launch a mass tree planting movement; however, we should strengthen the propaganda of mass forest protection and closely combine afforestation with forest protection.

　　开展群众性的护林运动
    一月二十七日，本报《读者来信》栏发表了读者贾茂亭、张毅夫对山西省临汾专区等地不断发生烧山害林事件的批评以后，我们又陆续收到了王国祥、史锡荣、李庆永、陈振华、林辰、赵速、王鹏举、孙仲、林心完、张维等读者来信，其中除少数来信是表扬护林模范外（已发表一部分，见二月十二日及二十四日本报《读者来信》栏），他们对察哈尔省延庆县、福建省福鼎县、苏南江宁县、河北省昌平县等地区不注意保护树林提出批评和建议。读者孙仲来信中指出察哈尔省光提倡造林，不注意护林的事实。他的信上说：“察哈尔省造林是很努力的。据省政府的统计，一九五零年共植树九千零九十四万余株；但因一部分地区还没有普遍深入地开展群众性的保护树林的运动，群众还不懂得保护树林的重要性，因而在阳原、蔚县、怀仁、阳高、涿鹿、延庆等县不断有烧山害林或盗伐林木的事件发生。虽然我还无法知道各地被毁林木的总数；但是就某些地区来看，已经损害的树木并不比栽活的树木少。”我们认为这是一个普遍而严重的现象。光提倡造林，不注意护林的教训，必须引起各地人民政府的重视。
    要保护山林，就必须依靠群众，开展群众性的保护山林运动。松江省读者赵速的来信，也证明了这一点。松江省去年保护山林工作是有成绩的，其主要经验是：在山林区开展了群众性的护林运动。该省林区的十个县份，都成立了林政科，先后吸收了八百五十个积极分子担任了护林员，组织了四百五十人的护林队，开办了短期护林训练班，并设立了四十四处火警瞭望台，使护林工作有了广泛的组织；此外，又通过表扬护林模范，进一步提高林区群众对保护山林的认识和热情。因此，去年全省很少发生烧山害林事件。
    植树的季节即将来到，各地正在积极准备开展群众性的植树运动；但应加强群众性的保护树林的宣传，把造林与护林工作紧密地结合起来。
