　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th: Youths in the liberated areas of Korea are extensively carrying out activities during World Youth Week to donate comfort items and write letters of appreciation to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Democratic Youth League organizations at all levels have been receiving large quantities of comfort items such as towels, soap, socks, and pens, as well as letters of appreciation, from youths in various regions on a daily basis. The Democratic Youth League in the central district of Pyongyang alone received over 750 comfort items and over 1,000 letters of appreciation in three days. The letters of appreciation from youths across the region unanimously emphasized that the broad masses of Korean youth are learning from the fighting experience of Chinese youth; the heroic battles waged by Chinese youth on the Korean battlefield against the common enemy of China and Korea—the American aggressors—have filled Korean youth with boundless gratitude. Liu Mingxiu, a student at Pyongyang Third Girls' Middle School, in addition to dedicating her embroidered handkerchief to the Volunteers, also wrote a letter of appreciation. The letter reads: "Chinese youth comrades-in-arms, your active assistance to the Korean people and youth has greatly strengthened the Korean youth's confidence in victory. Let the youth of Korea and China join hands and advance more bravely to annihilate the American aggressors!"
