Expose Counter-Revolutionary Elements

Counter-revolutionary elements owed the people countless blood debts in the past, and today they are still constantly trying to carry out sabotage, endangering the interests of the country and the people. Therefore, exposing counter-revolutionary elements is the responsibility of every Chinese person. Mr. Di Zhenggang, Quan Buhuan, and others in Beijing are good examples of shouldering such a glorious responsibility. People in all regions should learn from them and support the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government with practical actions. This newspaper warmly welcomes the people to expose special agents through the newspaper.

　　检举反革命分子
    反革命分子过去曾欠下人民无数的血债，今天他们仍然时时在想法进行破坏，危害国家和人民的利益。因此，检举反革命分子，是每一个中国人应有的责任。北京市民邸正刚、全不换等先生就是担起了这样一个光荣责任的好榜样。各地人民应当向他们学习。用实际行动拥护中央人民政府颁布的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”。本报热烈欢迎人民经过报纸检举特务。
