To the Editor:

Why was the construction of the Datong Mining Bureau's dedicated transportation railway branch line halted? The original plan was to build it from Kouquan to Changliushui. Last year, it was built to Yaya, only three kilometers away from the Wajinwan Mine. I don't know why the Ministry of Railways suddenly stopped construction midway. I think it is very important to complete this railway:

	(1) Completing the railway can save a large amount of transportation costs. The Wajinwan Mine produces more than 180,000 tons of coal annually. Due to the lack of train transportation, it is necessary to hire rubber-wheeled carts to transport the coal to Baitong, which is 10 kilometers away from the mine, and then load it onto trains for transportation to various places. In terms of cart transportation costs, each ton of coal costs 53 jin of millet, and the annual expenditure on cart transportation is about 11 million jin of millet. If this huge amount were invested in production, it would be equivalent to the production cost of more than 300,000 tons of coal, which is considerable.

	(2) Due to transportation difficulties, the Wajinwan Mine can only transport lump coal, and half of the mixed coal is left in the mine, which increases the cost of lump coal. Secondly, leaving mixed coal in the mine not only hinders work, but also creates a fire hazard if ventilation is poor.

	(3) If this railway is completed, it can also solve the problem of large-scale production reduction or shutdown of the mine due to seasonal influences. The cart road from the Wajinwan Mine to Baitong runs along the valley, and the water flow is rapid during the rainy season. Last year, a flash flood washed away more than 100 carts, so the carters were unwilling to risk transporting coal. Since the sales problem cannot be solved and the storage yard is small, production had to be reduced and stopped. This has caused a series of serious problems such as mass unemployment, increased coal costs, and supply and demand imbalances.

I hope that relevant departments will seriously consider the above suggestions and resume the railway construction work of the Wajinwan Mine as soon as possible.

### 大同矿运输支线为何停修？

　　大同矿运输支线为何停修？编辑同志：
    大同矿务局专用运输铁路原计划由口泉修至长流水，去年已修至雅崖，距离挖金湾矿仅三公里，不知为什么铁道部竟中途停止修建了。我认为修通这段铁路很重要：
    （一）修通了铁路，可以节省一大笔运费。挖金湾矿年产煤十八万吨以上，因缺乏火车运输，必须雇胶轮大车拉到距该矿十公里的白洞，再行装车运往各地。以大车运费来说：每吨煤是五十三斤小米，每年约开支大车运费合一千一百余万斤小米。这笔庞大的数字如投于生产，相当于三十多万吨煤的生产经费，这是很可观的。
    （二）由于运输困难，挖金湾矿只能运销块煤，二分之一的混煤均扔在井下了，这就加重了块煤的成本。其次混煤扔在井下，不但妨碍工作，如通风不好，就会自燃，这是很危险的。
    （三）如果修通这段铁路还可以解决该矿因季节性影响而大量减产或停工的现象。挖金湾矿到白洞的大车道系沿沟而行，每到雨季则水流湍急。去年因山洪暴发，共冲去一百余辆大车，因此车夫不肯冒险拉煤。销路问题既不能解决，存煤的场子又小，结果只好缩减和停止生产了。这就造成大批工人失业，煤的成本增加，供销不调等一系列严重问题。
    以上意见希望有关部门能很好考虑，尽速恢复挖金湾矿的铁道修建工作。
