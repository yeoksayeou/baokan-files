　　New Chinese Woodcuts in the Soviet Union
    The new Chinese woodcuts, exhibited at the People's Republic of China Art Exhibition held in the Soviet Union in October 1950, aroused special attention from the Soviet people and artists. People's Artist Gerasimov said: "If the Soviet people were already familiar with ancient Chinese art, then woodcuts, which realistically reflect the major events in the revolutionary life of the Chinese people, are a new acquaintance for the Soviet people. What surprises me is that the young artists of New China have not been directly influenced by formalism. They are embarking on the path of new realism."
    Soviet art historian Professor Stolev said: "Woodcuts utilize the positive elements of Chinese folk art. The advantage of Chinese artists is that they are not affected by the religious toxins in folk art, but carry forward the excellent traditions; at the same time, they can quickly abandon the influence of Western formalism." Art theorist Chike Daev similarly pointed out: "It is not copying the West, but the writers' creation is closely linked to the lives of the people. In this respect, the new Chinese woodcuts are at the forefront of plastic arts and have formed a new style of Chinese woodcuts."
    Regarding the style of new Chinese woodcuts, painter Shekale analyzed: "In some works, new Chinese woodcuts go beyond the inherent archival decoration and lyrical charm of woodcuts, bringing an epic tenacity and intense feeling." Sinologist Edlin also believes that the content and form of new Chinese woodcuts "reflect reality and adopt some good forms from Chinese painting."
    Many experts unanimously affirmed the achievements of woodcuts, while also pointing out our shortcomings. Professor Stolev said: "New Chinese artists have a high degree of talent in reflecting real life and are good at incorporating narrative in a theme, with rich emotions in their works. Although some works express the thoughts and feelings of the characters, many works still cannot fully create images."

　　新中国版画在苏联
    新中国的版画于一九五○年十月在苏联举行的中华人民共和国艺术展览会上，引起了苏联人民和美术家的特别的注意。人民画家葢拉西莫夫说：“如果说苏联人民很早就熟知中国古代艺术，那么，作为切实地反映中国人民革命生活过程中重大事件的版画，对苏联人民还是新的见面。使我惊异的是，新中国年青艺术家们，未受形式主义直接的影响。它正在走上新现实主义的道路。”
    苏联美术史家史多列文教授说：“版画利用了中国民间艺术中的积极因素。中国艺术家的优点，是未受民间艺术中的宗教毒素的影响，而是发扬着优良的传统；同时又能很快的抛弃了西洋形式主义的影响。”美术理论家齐可达也夫同样的指出：“它不是抄袭西洋，而是作家密切联系着人民生活的创作，这一点新中国的版画是走在造型艺术的前列，并且形成了中国版画新的风格。”
    关于新中国版画的风格，画家舍卡列所分析说：“中国新版画在某些作品中，超出了版画固有的案卷装饰和抒情的风趣，带来了史诗性的坚韧与强烈的感觉。”汉学家爱德林对新中国版画内容和形式，也认为“它的内容是反映现实的，并采取了中国绘画里一些好的形式”。
    很多专家都一致地着重肯定版画的成就，同时也指出我们不够的地方。史多列文教授说：“新中国艺术家，对于现实生活的反映，具有高度的才能，善于在一个主题里贯串着故事性，作品中的情绪饱满。虽然有些作品表现出了人物的思想感情，但尚有很多的作品还不能充分创造形象。”
