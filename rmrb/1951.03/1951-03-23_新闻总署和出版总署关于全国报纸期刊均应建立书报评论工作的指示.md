It is a work of significant political importance to regularly publish criticisms, introductions, and commentated publishing news of various publications (including books, periodicals, newspapers, art publications, wall charts, etc.) in newspapers and periodicals. At present, the people's enthusiasm for learning is increasing day by day, and the publishing industry has also made great progress. The number of books and periodicals published is increasing with each passing day. However, most newspapers and periodicals do not regularly publish reviews of publications. Many good publications, good newspaper articles, and good editing and publishing methods have not been widely circulated because they have not been recommended; there are also many bad publications, bad newspaper articles, and bad editing and publishing methods that have not received appropriate criticism, so that the errors, large or small, have not attracted the attention of authors, editors, publishers, distributors, and readers. This deprives readers of due guidance and publishing work of due supervision. It is necessary to strengthen the work of book and newspaper reviews in newspapers and periodicals in order to overcome the above shortcomings. The following provisions are hereby made:

　　1. All newspapers and periodicals in the country should, according to specific needs and possibilities, add a regular or irregular column for book and newspaper reviews (or book reviews, publication reviews, newspaper reviews, etc.) or a special publication to publish reviews and news about publications. The editorial departments of important newspapers and periodicals should designate capable personnel or organize commentators or experts from outside the newspaper to regularly undertake publication review work, and should publish appropriate reader contributions to absorb a large number of readers to participate in this work.

　　2. The reviews of publications in newspapers and periodicals should be serious and benevolent friends to help the vast number of readers, authors, editors, publishers, and distributors. Any text in book and newspaper reviews should strive to be serious and responsible, and appropriately measured. It should not be ambiguous, perfunctory, or boastful and flattering, becoming vulgar advertising. Nor should it be rude and rash, exaggerating shortcomings and errors, to the point of undermining the enthusiasm of legitimate authors, editors, and publishers.

　　3. The editors of book and newspaper reviews should establish necessary connections with authors, editors, publishers, and news publishing administrative organs, and should be responsible for urging the criticized to promptly publish a serious response to the criticism in the same newspaper or periodical, so that correct criticisms can achieve practical results and incorrect criticisms can receive due correction.

　　新闻总署和出版总署关于全国报纸期刊均应建立书报评论工作的指示
    在报纸期刊上经常发表对各种出版物（包括书籍、期刊、报纸、美术出版物、挂图等）的批评、介绍和有评论性的出版消息，是有重要政治意义的工作。现在，人民群众的学习热情日渐增涨，出版事业也有了很大的发展，书籍报刊出版的数量与日俱增。但是在大多数的报纸、期刊上还没有经常发表出版的评论。许多好的出版物，好的报刊文字，好的编辑出版方法，因为没有得到推荐，以致没没无闻，不能广泛地流行；也有许多不好的出版物、不好的报刊文字，不好的编辑出版方法，没有受到适当的批评，以致其中或大或小的错误没有引起作者、编辑者、出版者、发行者和读者的注意。这就使读者失去了应有的指导，也使出版工作失去了应有的监督。必须加强报纸期刊上的书报评论工作，才能克服上述的缺点。兹规定如下：
    一、全国各种报纸、期刊，都应当根据具体的需要和可能，增设定期的或不定期的书报评论（或图书评论、出版评论、报纸述评等）一栏或一种专刊，刊载有关出版物的评论和消息。重要的报纸、期刊的编辑部，都应当指定得力的人员或组织社外的评论员或专家，经常地担任出版评论工作，并应发表适当的读者投稿，来吸收大量的读者参加这个工作。
    二、报纸、期刊上对出版物的评论，应当是帮助广大的读者和作者、编辑者、出版者、发行者的严肃而与人为善的益友。书报评论中的任何文字，应当力求认真负责，恰如其分，既不应模棱两可，敷衍了事，或是吹嘘恭维，流为恶俗的广告，也不应粗暴鲁莽，夸大缺点错误，以至打击了正当的作者、编辑者和出版者的积极性。
    三、书报评论的编辑应当与作者、编辑者、出版者、和新闻出版行政机关建立应有的联系，并应负责督促被批评者在同一报刊上迅速发表对于批评的认真的答复，使正确的批评得到实际的效果，不正确的批评得到应有的辩正。
