Arrest Counter-Revolutionaries and Bring Them to Justice

The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, based on long-term investigation and reconnaissance, accepted accusations from the people, and in accordance with the provisions of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolution," arrested a batch of counter-revolutionaries and brought them to justice. This is a matter that delights the people. At present, the people throughout the country are generally demanding the resolute and severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries to thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary activities. This demand of the people is necessary to safeguard our national security and the people's happiness. At the recent first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress, many proposals demanded that the government swiftly and severely punish the counter-revolutionaries lurking in the people's capital. In their speeches, the representatives from all walks of life indignantly accused the heinous and incorrigible counter-revolutionaries of their crimes, urging the government to arrest them immediately. The People's Congress also passed a resolution to severely punish counter-revolutionaries. These just calls of the people's representatives have now begun to be translated into actual actions by the government.

Among the counter-revolutionaries arrested this time, some were murderers who had harmed revolutionary cadres before liberation, even massacring more than twenty district and village cadres at a time, slaughtering more than forty farmers, or burying the masses alive. Some were arsonists who burned down villages, even burning down more than fifty villages at a time, and destroying more than 300 houses in several villages. Some were despots who had captured large numbers of young men and sent them to the enemy puppets to serve as tools for attacking the people's revolution and as cannon fodder. Others were executioners who had suppressed the patriotic student movement and even rounded up students... In short, they were the most heinous and incorrigible elements. Others are current offenders who, taking advantage of the lenient policy of the People's Government, remain unrepentant. They either openly defy government decrees, sabotage land reform, or damage farmers' seedlings, or infiltrate factories to carry out various acts of sabotage. In the Beijing Tram Factory, fifty-nine complete trams were burned down by special agents, and the 25,000-kilowatt generator in the Beijing Power Plant has been sabotaged by special agents many times. There are also those who have infiltrated our agencies to spy for American and Chiang Kai-shek, or special agents who carry out other acts of sabotage, or armed bandits who organize bandits and attempt to carry out armed riots. These counter-revolutionaries, who are carrying out planned infiltration and sabotage simultaneously from both inside and outside, have not only carried out many evil activities in secret, but are also expanding the scope of their evil deeds. If we are numb and lack vigilance against them, our people and country will suffer very serious losses. This is a common sense that has been repeatedly proven by countless iron facts.

For these heinous and die-hard counter-revolutionaries, shouldn't we implement a severe suppression? The question is very obvious. If we stand on the side of the people, and not on any other side, then we can only follow the demands of the people. Those who should be shot should be shot, those who should be imprisoned should be imprisoned, and those who should be controlled should be controlled. We must not relax the punishment they deserve, hesitate, and condone these bandits who harm the people and sabotage the People's Democratic Republic, taking advantage of the government's lenient policy to escape punishment and continue to carry out sabotage.

What should especially arouse our high vigilance is the counter-revolutionaries who have mixed into our government departments, agencies, organizations, and factories. Because a special agent named Fang Wei was infiltrated into the Tax Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, some confidential documents were stolen, causing serious losses. Shi Xiangru, the head of the Yiguandao sect, who has harmed countless people, infiltrated the Beijing Grain Trade Association. Lan Jingwen and Yuan Shuchun, members of the bandit "Homecoming Corps," infiltrated the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant posing as workers. Zhang Bingwen and Lü Qingchang, habitual bandits with blood debts, also infiltrated the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and became police officers in the workers' security team. How can the safety of these agencies, organizations, and factories be guaranteed if these counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated them and occupy such important positions? This is such a dangerous thing! Are the bloody lessons of special agents burning down fifty-nine trams, sabotaging generators, and burning down rubber factories not worth remembering!? Unless one adopts a completely indifferent attitude towards the cause and interests of the people, no one can allow counter-revolutionaries to infiltrate the internal affairs of our government departments, agencies, organizations, and factories. Stalin warned us in the concluding remarks of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): "The fortress is most easily breached from within." Yes, counter-revolutionary special agents, bandits, murderers, assassins, and saboteurs are trying every means to infiltrate our People's Government departments, agencies, organizations, and factories, attempting to attack our vital points. If we show "gentleness" and "kindness" to these counter-revolutionaries, it will actually be extreme cruelty to the people. Isn't this principle very clear?

It is absolutely necessary for the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest such a group of counter-revolutionaries. All parts of the country should take such resolute and severe measures so that the free and happy life that our countless martyrs exchanged for their blood and sacrifice under the enemy's butcher knife will not be destroyed by these evil remnants.

### 逮捕反革命分子归案法办

　　逮捕反革命分子归案法办
    北京市人民政府公安局，根据长期调查与侦察的结果，接受人民群众的控告，按照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”的规定，逮捕了一批反革命分子，归案法办，这是大快人心的事情。现时全国人民都普遍要求对于反革命分子实行坚决的、严厉的镇压，彻底肃清一切反革命活动。人民的这种要求，是为了保卫我们的国家安全和人民幸福所必须实现的。最近召开的北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议，有许多提案都要求政府迅速严惩潜伏在人民首都的反革命分子。各界代表在发言中曾义愤填胸地纷纷指控了首恶的和怙恶不悛的反革命分子的罪行，督责政府立即予以逮捕。各界人民代表会议还通过了严惩反革命的决议。人民代表的这些正义的呼声，现在已经开始成为政府的实际行动了。
    这一次所逮捕的反革命分子，其中有一批是解放前曾残害革命干部甚至一次即残杀区、村干部二十余人，屠杀农民四十余人或者活埋群众的杀人凶犯。有一批是放火烧毁村庄，甚至一次即烧毁五十余村而在几个村庄即烧毁民房三百余间的放火匪徒。有一批则是曾经抓捕大批青年壮丁送给敌伪充当进攻人民革命的工具、充当炮灰的恶霸。另一些则是曾经摧残学生爱国运动甚至围捕学生的刽子手……概括一句说，即罪大恶极的首恶分子。另外一些则是利用人民政府的宽大政策，迄今仍怙恶不悛的现行犯。他们或者公然违抗政府法令，破坏土地改革，破坏农民的青苗，或者打入工厂进行各种破坏。本市电车厂曾有五十九辆完整的电车被特务们烧毁，本市发电厂的二万五千千瓦的发电机曾多次遭受特务们的破坏。还有一批则是打入我各机关为美蒋刺探机密的间谍或进行其他破坏的特务，或者组织匪徒企图实行武装暴乱的武装匪徒。这些从外部和内部同时进行有计划的潜伏与破坏的反革命分子，不但在暗中已经进行了许多罪恶活动，而且还正在扩大他们作恶的范围。如果我们麻木不仁，对他们缺乏警惕，我们的人民和国家，就会遭到非常严重的损失。这已经是被无数次铁的事实所反复证明的常识了。
    对于这些罪大恶极死心踏地的反革命分子，难道还不应该实行严厉的镇压吗？问题很显然，如果我们站在人民立场，而不是站在另外其他什么立场，那末对于他们就只能按照人民群众的要求，该枪毙的就要枪毙，该监禁的就要监禁，该管制的就要管制，决不能放松对他们应有的惩治，优柔寡断，纵容这些残害人民、破坏人民民主共和国的匪徒，利用政府的宽大政策，逍遥法外，继续进行破坏。
    尤其应该引起我们高度警惕的是混入我们的政府部门和机关、团体、工厂中的反革命分子。北京市人民政府的税务局，因为被混进了一个特务方伟，就使得一些机密的文件被偷走，造成了严重的损失。害人无数的一贯道头子石相如，混进了北京市粮食同业公会，土匪“还乡团”的蓝景文、袁书春混进了石景山钢铁厂冒充工人，血债累累的惯匪张秉文、吕庆昌也混进了石景山钢铁厂，而且当了工人警卫队的警士，试问这些机关、团体和工厂，被这些反革命分子混了进去，占据着这样紧要的地方，这些机关、团体和工厂的安全怎么能得到保障？这是多么危险的事情！难道特务烧毁电车五十九辆，破坏发电机，烧毁橡胶厂等等的血的经验教训，还值不得我们记取么！？除非对于人民的事业和利益抱着全无心肝的态度，否则，任何人都不能容许反革命分子混到我们的政府部门和机关、团体、工厂的内部来。斯大林在联共党史的结束语中，曾经警告我们说：“堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。”是的，反革命的特务、土匪等杀人凶手、暗害分子、破坏分子，正在想尽一切方法，混入我们人民政府部门和机关、团体、工厂内部来，企图攻击我们的要害，假若我们对于这些反革命分子，表现“温柔”“仁慈”，实际上就必然是对人民极大的残忍。这个道理难道还不非常明白吗？
    北京市公安局逮捕了这样的一批反革命分子，这是绝对必要的。全国各地都应该采取这样坚决的严厉的措施，使得我们由无数先烈在敌人屠刀下抛头颅洒热血换来的自由幸福生活，不会被这些万恶余孽所破坏。
