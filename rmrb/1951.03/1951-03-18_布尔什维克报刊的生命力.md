　　The Vitality of the Bolshevik Press
       A. Botmin

　　Our newspapers and magazines play a great role in the victorious completion of Stalin's plan for communist construction. The Bolshevik press is such a sharp weapon that, with its help, the Party speaks to the Soviet people in the language the Party needs every day and every hour, mobilizing the working people to engage in heroic labor, and educating the broad masses of the people in the spirit of communist consciousness, Soviet patriotism, and infinite loyalty to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.

　　The tasks that our newspapers need to complete with combat require all our central and local newspapers and magazines to tirelessly consolidate and expand their ties with the masses with all their strength, and to absorb more author activists to participate in the work of the newspaper. Lenin and Stalin taught the Bolshevik press workers with these. Lenin pointed out that "only when every five leading and regular writers have five hundred or even five thousand non-writer staff members at the same time can the newspaper be lively and vigorous."

　　The Soviet press knows from life many tested ways to strengthen ties with the masses and absorb a wide range of author activists from workers, peasants, and intellectuals to participate in newspaper work. Among these methods, the newspaper's connection with the masses through letters has been and will continue to be one of the basic methods. The letters of the Soviet people are a source of life juice for every newspaper. Without the letters of the working people and without good correspondence between the editorial department and the masses, no newspaper organization can exist.

　　The letters of the working people are a great wealth for the editorial department. ——The Soviet people reflect the most realistic and most vital themes of Soviet reality in their letters. The political and cultural level of the Soviet people is constantly increasing, so the content of their letters to the newspapers has become richer and more diverse. The working people write about the experience of advanced figures at work, involve important issues of literature and art in their letters, sharply criticize shortcomings, and expose bureaucrats and mandarins, and violators of state and labor discipline. Comrade Stalin pointed out that workers and rural correspondents are "first of all, the exposers of the shortcomings of our Soviet society, the fighters for the elimination of these shortcomings, and the guides of proletarian public opinion, which strives to guide the inexhaustible power of this great element to help the Party and the Soviet government in the arduous cause of socialist construction."

　　Our Party attaches special significance to the work of newspapers in handling letters from the working people. As early as 1936, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) sharply criticized the intolerable style of bureaucratic and lordly impoliteness in the Bolshevik press's attitude towards letters from the working people in the "Resolution on the Work of the *North Caucasus Bolshevik Newspaper* and the *Star Newspaper* in Handling Letters from Workers," teaching all newspaper workers to always remember that behind every letter is a living person who requires a kind and serious attitude from the Party, and that the newspaper is "one of the links between our Party and the working class" (Stalin). With this resolution, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) charged the editors-in-chief of each newspaper to personally lead the work of the editorial department's department for letters from the working people, carefully pay attention to the letters sent to the newspaper, study them, publish more letters from the working people in the newspaper, and organize the work of the editorial department in such a way that no letter is left unanswered to the author, and that every letter criticizing shortcomings receives the necessary handling.

　　Many of our newspapers have carried out enormous and serious work in handling letters from the working people. Generally speaking, the editorial department of *Pravda* receives more than 600 letters from the working people of our country every day. In the past five years, the number of letters received by the editorial departments of *Komsomolskaya Pravda* and *Trud* has almost doubled. In January 1951 alone, the editorial department of *Trud* received more than 11,000 letters. More letters from the working people have begun to be published in the newspapers. The editorial department of *Komsomolskaya Pravda* has received the active sponsorship of the Party organization. On the suggestion of the Party members of the secretariat, the newspaper held a working conference of the editorial department to discuss the issues of improving the work of handling letters from the working people and strengthening the connection between the editorial department and the readers. The comrades of the editorial department discussed a series of important issues in detail and comprehensively: such as "Letters from the Working People—The Basis of Editorials," "Classification and Selection of Letters," "Textual Modification of Letters," "Fighting for the Effectiveness of Letters," "Correspondence Between the Editorial Department and Readers," and so on.

　　It is wrong to fail to see the serious shortcomings in this important work and to simply improve the work of handling letters in general. In the editorial departments of many newspapers, there are still facts of handling letters from the working people too slowly, formalistically, and bureaucratically.

　　Not long ago, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) severely condemned the bureaucratic attitude of the staff of the editorial department of *Izvestia* towards letters from the working people. The letters sent to the editorial department of *Izvestia* were not studied. The fact that few letters were published in the newspaper is intolerable: in 1950, a total of 27,000 letters were received, but only 189 letters were published or used in various reviews, columns, etc.

　　The editorial department of *Inland Water Transport* also has an indifferent attitude towards letters from the working people. The Party workers of the inland water transport industry sent three letters to the editorial department of the newspaper. After the editorial department published one of them, it immediately wrote to this "annoying" author: "We 'really' spent a lot of effort to modify your already published communication, but there are still some not very good points in it. The editorial department did not stint its labor, but this does not mean that we will publish your reports of little value or superficial reports in the future..." The following is still in such an unbearable tone to suggest to the author that he should learn to express his thoughts correctly before writing to the newspaper. Such an answer is completely intolerable, is it not clear?

　　The department for letters from the working people in the newspaper editorial department plays an important role. Their work should be organized in such a way that it can urge a deep analysis and study of the letters of the editorial department, consolidate the connection between the newspaper and the masses, and ensure the systematic publication of letters from the working people in the newspaper. The role of the department for letters from the working people should be greatly improved. Under no circumstances should their functions be reduced to receiving, registering, and forwarding letters. It is wrong for the editorial department to entrust all the work of letters to a department for letters from the working people. Only when all the comrades in the editorial department can handle letters from the working people carefully and enthusiastically can achievements be obtained.

　　To treat letters from the working people carefully and attentively is an indispensable quality of the Bolshevik press workers. It is the glorious task of all newspaper editorial departments to cultivate this feeling of uncompromisingly dealing with slight manifestations of bureaucracy and indifference towards letters from the working people for every staff member of the press, and to teach the young staff members how to handle letters. How should the comrades of the editorial department handle the work of letters? How can the editorial department send various letters to the relevant agencies as soon as possible and satisfactorily after taking measures to eliminate the shortcomings pointed out in the letters? These and many other issues should be constantly seen by the editorial department and their Party organizations.

　　The Bolshevik press has the responsibility of solving huge and complex tasks. While newspapers and magazines are spread to every corner of our vast motherland, they also bring the language of Bolshevik truth to the masses, and connect our great Party of Lenin and Stalin with thousands upon thousands of Soviet people with thousands of threads. The Party and Comrade Stalin teach that the strength of our press lies in its broad connection with the masses. To constantly consolidate these connections and to listen attentively to the voices of the working people is the primary responsibility of all our newspapers and magazines.

　　布尔什维克报刊的生命力
       Ａ·波特明
    在共产主义建设的斯大林计划的胜利完成中，我们的报纸和杂志具有极大的作用。布尔什维克报刊是这样一种尖锐的武器，在它的帮助下，党每日每时地用党所需要的语言与苏维埃人民进行谈话，动员劳动人民从事英雄的劳动，以共产主义的自觉的、苏维埃爱国主义的、无限忠诚于列宁、斯大林伟大事业的精神来教育广大的人民群众。
    摆在我们报纸面前需要以战斗去完成的任务，要求所有我们的中央和地方的报纸及杂志，不疲倦地巩固和用一切力量扩大自己与群众的联系，更多地吸收作者积极分子来参加报纸的工作。列宁和斯大林就是用这些来教导布尔什维克报刊工作人员的。列宁指出，“只有在每有五个领导的和经常写作的作家，就同时有五百个乃至五千个非作家的工作人员的时候，机关报才会是活泼而有生命力的。”
    苏维埃报刊从生活上知道不少经过考验的、加强与群众联系的、在工人、农民和知识分子中吸收广泛的作者积极分子参加报纸工作的各种方式。在这些方式中，报纸通过信件与群众相联系曾经是并且将来也是基本方式之一。苏维埃人民的来信对于每一报纸都是一种用生命的汁水来滋养报纸的源泉。没有劳动人民的来信，没有编辑部与群众之间的很好的信件往还，任何报刊机关都是不能存在的。
    劳动人民的来信是编辑部的巨大的财富。——苏维埃人民在自己的来信中反映出最现实的、苏维埃现实中最有生命的题材。苏维埃人民的政治文化水平不断地在增涨着，因此，他们写给报纸的信件中的内容就成为更丰富和更多样性的了。劳动人民写先进人物工作的经验，在自己的来信中涉及到文学和艺术的重要问题，尖锐地批评缺点，揭发官僚主义者和官老爷、国家和劳动纪律的违犯者。斯大林同志指出，工人和农村通讯员“首先是我们苏维埃社会的缺点的揭发者，是为消除这些缺点而斗争的斗士，是无产阶级舆论的指导者，这种指导者力求指导这个伟大要素的取用不尽的力量来帮助党和苏联政府进行艰巨的社会主义建设事业。”
    我党给予报纸处理劳动人民来信的工作以特殊的意义。早在一九三六年，联共（布）中央委员会在“关于《北高加索布尔什维克报》和《星报》处理劳动者来信的工作的决议”中尖锐地批评了布尔什维克报刊的官僚主义的、老爷式的不礼貌的对待劳动人民来信的态度的不能容忍的作风时，教导所有报刊工作人员永远记得每一封信件后面都是一个为党所要求的具有亲切认真态度的有生命的人，报刊——是“在我党与工人阶级之间的纽带之一”（斯大林）。联共（布）中央委员会用这个决议责成各个报纸的主编亲自领导编辑部劳动人民来信部的工作，仔细地注意寄给报纸的信件，研究它们，多多在报纸上发表劳动人民的来信，并且应该这样地组织编辑部的工作，就是使得不致有一封信不给作者以回答的，使得批评缺点的每一封信都得到了必要的处理。
    我们的许多报纸都进行了处理劳动人民来信的巨大而严肃的工作。一般地说，《真理报》编辑部每天都收到六百多封我国劳动人民的来信。在最近五年来，《共产主义青年团真理报》和《劳动报》编辑部的来信几乎增加了两倍。仅在一九五一年一月里，《劳动报》编辑部就收到了一万一千多封信件。报纸上开始较多地发表劳动人民的来信。《共产主义青年团真理报》编辑部得到了党组织的主动的赞助。该报根据秘书处共产党员的建议，曾经召开编辑部工作会议，讨论改善处理劳动人民来信工作和加强编辑部与读者联系的问题。编辑部同人详尽而全面地讨论了一系列的重要问题：如“劳动人民的来信——是社论的基础”，“来信的分类选择”，“来信的文字修改”，“为来信的有效性而斗争”，“编辑部与读者的往来信件”及其他等等。
    看不见这一重要工作中的严重的缺点，仅仅为了一般地改善处理来信工作是不对的。在许多报纸的编辑部还存在着过于迟缓地、形式主义地、官僚主义地处理劳动人民来信的事实。
    不久以前，联共（布）中央委员会严厉地谴责了《消息报》编辑部工作人员对待劳动人民来信的官僚主义的态度。寄到《消息报》编辑部的信件没有被研究过。在该报篇幅上发表的信件很少，是不可容忍的事实：在一九五○年内共收到二万七千封信，只有一百八十九封信由各种述评、专栏等发表或被利用了。
    《内河运输报》编辑部也存在着对待劳动人民来信的漠不关心的态度。内河运输业的党工作人员寄给该报编辑部三封信。编辑部在发表了其中的一封以后，马上对这个“惹人讨厌”的作者写道：“对于您的已经发表了的通讯，我们‘着实’用了很大工夫去修改，但是其中仍旧有些不很好的地方，编辑部并没有吝惜自己的劳动，但是这可不是说，我们以后还会刊登您的没有很大价值的或肤浅的报道……”。以下还是用这样一种令人难耐的语调向作者建议，请他先学会正确地叙述自己的思想再给报纸写稿。类似这样的回答完全是不可容忍的，难道还不明白吗？
    报纸编辑部的劳动人民来信部有着重大的作用。他们的工作应该这样地组织起来，使它能督促深刻地去分析和研究编辑部的信件，巩固报纸与群众的联系，保证有系统地在报纸上发表劳动人民的来信。劳动人民来信部的作用应当大大地提高。在任何情形之下，也不应当把他们的职能降低到限于来信的接收、登记和转送。编辑部把所有来信的工作只包给一个劳动人民来信部去处理，那是错误的。只有在编辑部全体同人能细心地热忱地处理劳动人民来信的时候，才能获得成绩。
    慎重地、关切地对待劳动人民的来信——是布尔什维克报刊工作人员的必不可少的品质。使报刊的每一个工作人员培养这种不妥协地对待稍有表现官僚主义的和漠不关心地对待劳动人民来信的情感，教导年青的工作人员应当如何处理信件，——是一切报纸编辑部的光荣任务。编辑部同人应当怎样处理来信的工作呢？编辑部把对于消除来信中所指出的缺点而采取了办法，就将各种信件寄给有关机关怎能尽量速复而使人满意呢？这些以及许多其他问题应当经常地由编辑部和他们的党组织所看到。
    布尔什维克报刊负有解决巨大和复杂任务的责任。报纸和杂志散布到了我们广阔的祖国的每一个角落的同时，也把布尔什维克真理的语言带给了群众，用千丝万缕把我们的列宁斯大林的伟大的党与千千万万的苏维埃人民联系起来。党、斯大林同志教导说，我们的报刊的力量在于与群众的广泛的联系。不停地巩固这些联系，关切地倾听劳动人民的呼声——是所有我们的报纸和杂志的首要责任。（原文载一九五一年二月二十一日苏联《文化与生活》第五期）
