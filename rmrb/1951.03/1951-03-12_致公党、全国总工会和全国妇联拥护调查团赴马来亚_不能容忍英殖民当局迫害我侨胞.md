　　Zhigong Party, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and All-China Women's Federation Support Investigation Group's Visit to Malaya: Cannot Tolerate British Colonial Authorities Persecuting Our Overseas Chinese Compatriots
    [Our Newspaper] The China Zhi Gong Party, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation have successively issued statements supporting the China People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees in organizing an investigation group to go to Malaya to investigate the situation of the refugees.
    The statement of the China Zhi Gong Party stated: Since British imperialism began opposing the Chinese people in various parts of Malaya in 1948, our overseas Chinese compatriots have suffered countless persecutions, which are heartbreaking and infuriating. These crimes have recently become even more rampant and inhumane. All Chinese people express infinite anger at this unbridled atrocity of the British imperialist colonial authorities. Therefore, our party believes that the Malaya Investigation Group recently organized by the China People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees is absolutely necessary. We are willing to support this organization with great enthusiasm and do our best to assist its work.
    The statement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated: The British imperialists' consistent barbaric acts of trampling and slaughtering our overseas Chinese compatriots have once again manifested in Malaya. This action has aroused extreme anger from the entire Chinese people. The Malayan overseas Chinese compatriots are flesh and blood relatives of the Chinese people, and the Chinese working class will never tolerate such brutal crimes of imperialism being inflicted on the Chinese overseas compatriots. Therefore, in addition to expressing serious protests to the British colonial authorities, the Chinese working class firmly supports the decision of various Chinese people's organizations and relief agencies to organize the China People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees and send an investigation group to Malaya to investigate the suffering of overseas Chinese compatriots, and will give it full support.
    The statement of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation stated: The bloody crimes of British imperialists persecuting our Malayan overseas Chinese compatriots have aroused the unparalleled anger and protest of our government and people. Ignoring this serious warning, the British authorities have recently intensified their persecution of our overseas Chinese compatriots on a larger scale and more cruelly, which we absolutely cannot tolerate.
    We must investigate these barbaric atrocities of British imperialism and announce the results of the investigation to our compatriots across the country and the people of the world, so that the bloody grievances of millions of persecuted overseas Chinese compatriots can receive a fair appeal, and those criminals can receive the condemnation and punishment they deserve.
    Therefore, we warmly support the decision of the China People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees to send an investigation group to Malaya to investigate the suffering of overseas Chinese, and hope that the investigation group will set off as soon as possible and bring the warm care of the entire people of the motherland to the overseas Chinese compatriots living far away.
    We once again warn those brutal imperialist elements: The great Chinese people who have stood up cannot be arbitrarily bullied and humiliated by anyone.

　　致公党、全国总工会和全国妇联拥护调查团赴马来亚
    不能容忍英殖民当局迫害我侨胞
    【本报讯】中国致公党、中华全国总工会和中华全国民主妇女联合会，先后发表声明，拥护中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会组织调查团赴马来亚调查难侨情况。
    中国致公党的声明称：英国帝国主义自一九四八年在马来亚各地开始反对中国人民以来，我海外侨胞受尽无数的迫害，令人心酸发指。这种罪行，最近更变本加厉，惨绝人寰。凡属中国人民，对于英国帝国主义殖民当局这种肆无忌惮的暴行，无不表示无限的愤怒。因此，本党对于最近中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会所组织的马来亚调查团认为是绝对应该的。我们愿以绝大的热忱来支持这个组织，并尽最大的力量协助其工作。
    中华全国总工会的声明称：英帝国主义对我国侨胞的一贯蹂躏和屠杀的野蛮行为，又一次在马来亚表现出来，这一行动已经引起全中国人民的极端愤怒。马来亚侨胞与中国人民是血肉相关的，中国工人阶级决不能容忍帝国主义的这种残暴罪行加在中国侨胞的身上。因此，中国工人阶级除向英国殖民当局表示严重抗议外，对于我国各人民团体及救济机关组织中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会及派调查团赴马来亚调查侨胞受难情况的决定，坚决拥护，并予全力支持。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会的声明中称：英帝国主义者迫害我国马来亚侨胞的血腥罪行，曾引起我国政府和人民的无比愤怒和抗议。英国当局不顾这种严重的警告，最近反而变本加厉，更大规模，更残酷地对我侨胞进行迫害，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。
    我们必须对英帝国主义这种野蛮暴行，进行调查，并将调查的结果向全国同胞和全世界人民宣布，使千千万万被迫害侨胞的血海冤仇得到正义的申诉，使那些凶犯们受到应有的谴责和惩罚。
    因此，我们热烈拥护中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会派遣调查团赴马来亚调查华侨受难情况的决定，并盼调查团早日起程，把祖国全体人民的热烈关怀，带给遥居海外的侨胞们。
    我们再一次警告那些残暴的帝国主义分子们：已经站起来的伟大中国人民不是任何人所能任意欺侮凌辱的。
