　　Suggestion to Unify National Standards of Weights and Measures as Soon as Possible
Comrade Editor:
　　Due to the lack of unified weights and measures across the country, the masses are greatly inconvenienced. For example, here (De County, Shandong), farmers buying and selling grain at two markets only a dozen or so li apart, using the same "one dou" measure, find a difference of several jin, causing significant losses for the farmers. When reading the newspaper to the villagers, the inconsistent units also confuse the listeners. For instance, the People's Daily on March 12th mentioned that the average yield per mu in Dazhai Village, Shanxi, exceeded pre-war levels by 2.7 dou, and the farmers said, "That depends on how big the dou is, and how big the mu is."
　　Now that the country is unified, to better build our nation, I hope that relevant departments should promptly formulate a unified national system of weights and measures.

　　Editor's Note: The suggestion to unify national standards of weights and measures is correct. Currently, the Central Technical Bureau of the Central Finance and Economics Committee is studying and preparing to solve this problem.

### 建议及早统一全国度量衡标准

专栏：来信摘要

　　建议及早统一全国度量衡标准编辑同志：
    由于全国各地度量衡不统一，使群众感到很大不便。如这里（山东德县）的农民在两个相差十几里路的集市上买卖粮食，同时是“一斗”粮，却相差数斤，使农民吃亏很大。在念报纸给老乡们听时，因为单位不一致，也使听报的人闹得很糊涂。譬如三月十二日人民日报载有山西大寨村的生产计划，说去年每亩地平均增产超过战前二斗七升，农民就说：“这可要看多大的斗，多大的亩了。”
    全国已经统一，为了更好地建设我们的国家，我希望有关部门应该迅速制定全国统一的度量衡制。

    编者按：要求全国统一度量衡标准的意见是对的。目前中央财政经济委员会中央技术局正在研究和准备解决这一问题。
