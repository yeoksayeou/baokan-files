Review of the New Year Picture "The Party's Good Daughter - Zhao Guilan"
	Liao Hua

Looking at the New Year pictures of 1951 from a developmental perspective, we have reason to say that they have made new achievements. I will not comprehensively introduce the achievements of these works here, nor will I point out the shortcomings that should be overcome. I will only express some feelings about "The Party's Good Daughter - Zhao Guilan," which represents a new style.

Restoring production and developing production are the basic tasks of building a new China, and are also one of the important current tasks of the Communists who contribute everything (even their lives) to the motherland wholeheartedly for the people. It is particularly meaningful that the author takes the meeting between the outstanding Communist Party member and representative of the working people—Zhao Guilan—and Chairman Mao as the theme of the New Year picture. The author does not explain this theme in a flat, news-recording manner, but expresses it realistically and vividly.

The outstanding leader of the Party, the beloved leader of the people, has not appeared on New Year pictures for the first time. In fact, many New Year pictures have images of Chairman Mao. Some are visiting factories, some are accepting gifts from representatives of ethnic minorities, some are talking with the masses, and some are reviewing revolutionary troops, or at least a portrait in the mass ranks or auditorium. There is a reason why Chairman Mao repeatedly appears in these many New Year pictures: this just shows that the masses are very willing to see their beloved leader often, and are willing to be encouraged and enlightened by the leader's portrait when they come into contact with New Year pictures. Art workers understand the legitimacy of these requirements very well, so they use artistic creation to meet the needs of the masses. – This is very correct. However, it is rare to be able to portray the character of the people's leader and the relationship between the leader and the masses as well as Comrade Lin Gang's painting. Moreover, in last year's New Year pictures, there were even extremely sloppy descriptions that disappointed the readers in terms of appearance. The image of Chairman Mao in "The Party's Good Daughter - Zhao Guilan" cannot be said to be without shortcomings. – The purpose of the gesture of that left hand is not clear enough, the shape is not natural enough, and the position is not natural enough, which is a shortcoming that should be overcome. But from the main aspect, this work vividly portrays Chairman Mao's character, appearance and relationship with the masses. We certainly cannot say that this image has fully expressed Chairman Mao's wisdom, perseverance and other characteristics, but it does express his focus, humility, simplicity, nature, concern for the masses and love for the masses, which are some important characteristics. As an image in plastic arts, although it cannot dramatically show what Chairman Mao is saying, it can indeed remind people of instructions on revolutionary work from his attitude towards Zhao Guilan. This structural way of talking with Zhao Guilan can make readers feel as if they are receiving Chairman Mao's encouragement and education. Regardless of whether readers are familiar with Chairman Mao's demeanor, they can somewhat appreciate the respect and kindness of the people's leader from this work.

As the protagonist of this work—Zhao Guilan—the character depiction is also realistic and reasonable. The author did not deify the hero, making her an unattainable superman, nor did he ignore her psychological description when she longed to meet and finally met her leader. That very happy mood, respect and love for the leader, and the attitude of listening carefully to instructions without being restrained, are very consistent with the character of the young, humble, and outstanding Communist Party member Zhao Guilan, and also very appropriately portray her identity. Speaking of Zhao Guilan, readers will always immediately care about her disabled left hand. The author did not ignore this left hand with special significance. In this work, the position it occupies is very important, but it is not mechanically and routinely "explained"; through the conspicuous gloves of color, people can be reminded of the respectable hero's disability obtained because of sparing no personal sacrifice and maintaining revolutionary property. The disability as a glorious symbol, but not like the cover of a certain issue of "Chinese Women," gives excessive and unnecessary exaggeration to this symbol.

Looking at it as a group portrait composition, the portraits in this New Year picture are rich. On the portraits of many members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and heroic models, it is obvious that the author has gone through a lot of hard design and serious depiction. Although the arrangement of the characters is not perfect enough, the entire picture does have the characteristics of grandeur and variety. In particular, the heroic models such as Tian Guiying and Zhang Shuyi are not only lifelike, but also have the appropriate and reasonable dramatic nature in their movements and expressions. Compared with the compositions of some so-called mass scenes pieced together with a pile of characters, it is clearly shown that the author has made due efforts in the composition. In the use of background and props, although complicated, it can create a unified mood effect. From this point of view, this painting is simpler and brighter than Gu Yuan's "Chairman Mao Talking with Peasants".

One of the gratifying and prominent features of this New Year picture is the appropriate use of lines. Although the mastery of lines is still inevitably somewhat immature, in the expression of materiality, three-dimensionality, and spatial sense, it shares the realistic and accurate characteristics with Li Qi and Feng Zhen's "Great Meeting". The line drawing of the main parts is very refined, but it does not appear empty; the line drawing of some objects is very delicate and complex, but it does not appear cluttered and trivial; this clearly shows that the author is trying to absorb the advantages of traditional Chinese art, and it is clear that a certain effect has been achieved. In this work, the author does not regard the line as a rigid symbol for explaining the outline, nor does he waste energy on the interest of the line. As long as we compare the faces and clothes of the main characters with the flower pots, carpets, etc., we cannot but admit the author's legitimate attempt to apply excellent traditional techniques to the task of depicting new things, and has achieved results that do not disappoint readers. In adapting to the audience's appreciation taste—freshness and clarity—one dares to assert: this form is one of the forms that is worth promoting and can be developed.

Regardless of content and form, this painting has significant achievements. This kind of achievement was lacking in the New Year pictures before this year, so we have reason to give it a higher evaluation. But we are not satisfied with these achievements, and we need to further ask the author to work harder so that this work can be more perfect. For the time being, without criticizing the problems in the expression methods such as the yellow chair that jumps out and the overly eye-catching slender column heads, only some opinions on the handling of the relationship between the characters are put forward for discussion.

As a solemn scene with many heroic models participating, the current processing method is not completely satisfactory. Because it is not reasonable enough, not natural enough, and not typical enough. If it is said that this is not a large composition with a large number of people, but only uses Chairman Mao to represent the Party's care and education for outstanding party members, and Zhao Guilan to represent the labor model's respect and love for Chairman Mao, then the advantages of the depiction of the main characters mentioned above have guaranteed the success of this work. However, since these many important figures appear on the same picture at the same time, they should be given positions that conform to their identities and conform to the plot as much as possible, and actions, postures, and expressions that conform to their identities and conform to the specific environment. They should express this solemn theme as concentratedly as possible. Unfortunately, the author emphasizes diversity too much and ignores a more reasonable concentration (as long as it does not form a rigid and unchanging composition, more concentration is necessary.) Therefore, it gives the reader an impression that some people present do not care about Chairman Mao and Zhao Guilan's conversation. – Like an ordinary social gathering, like in the lounge of a meeting, each talking about their own problems. Chairman Mao's appearance at such a meeting is not a trivial matter. At the Women's Congress, Chairman Mao shook hands with the wife of General Li Zhaolin, and the whole audience was silent, and the eyes of hundreds of people were concentrated. What impact Chairman Mao's conversation with Zhao Guilan should have on the people present is completely imaginable. Assuming that in the fact that the Central Committee received labor models, there are indeed fragments of plots in which each person talks about their own problems, as art, as art that essentially reflects life rather than records phenomena, this plot lacks representative meaning, is not typical, and is not worth emphasizing. As a good daughter of the Party, when she appears in front of Chairman Mao, what attitude the members of the Central Committee may be, and should be, we can get reference from the movie "The Fall of Berlin". The scene of Stalin receiving Stakhanov worker Alyosha is depicted both lively and solemnly, both diverse and unified. Regardless of what differences there are between Soviet customs and Chinese customs, the current structural method cannot be regarded as perfectly portraying this scene of great significance, and has not well portrayed the interrelationships between the characters. Perhaps, the author is dealing with the two people behind Commander-in-Chief Zhu who are talking, and the two people behind Chairman Mao who are talking, in order to echo and echo the conversation between Chairman Mao and Zhao Guilan, and to use this to express the latter's specific reflection in the secondary characters and strengthen the effect; but this attempt has not been clearly expressed. It is clear that the author is emphasizing the change in composition, but this change hinders the concentration of the main plot and cannot reasonably express the attention of the labor models to Chairman Mao, whom they sincerely love, are eager to approach, and are talking to.

Then again, shortcomings are unavoidable. New Year pictures are still young. Even if there are serious shortcomings now, as long as we look at these works from a developmental perspective, we should give a higher evaluation to their existing achievements. Although we should not be complacent and cannot be complacent, the existing achievements are indeed gratifying; because these relatively excellent works foreshadow the magnificent future of New Year pictures. If the national artists who are willing to serve the people can deeply familiarize themselves with revolutionary life, seriously study the needs of the masses, appropriately apply and strive to find various new methods of expression, then the achievements of the New Year pictures in 1952 will be even more brilliant.

### 评新年画“党的好女儿——赵桂兰”

　　评新年画“党的好女儿——赵桂兰”
    廖华
    从发展中看一九五一年的新年画，我们有理由说它有了崭新的成就。我不在这里全面介绍这些作品的成就，并指出应该克服的缺点，只是对代表着新的作风的“党的好女儿——赵桂兰”发表一些感想。
    恢复生产，发展生产，这是建设新中国的基本任务，也就是全心全意为人民的祖国贡献一切（以至生命）的共产党员的当前的重要任务之一。作者把优秀的共产党员和劳动人民的代表——赵桂兰——与毛主席的会见，作为新年画的主题，是特别有意义的。作者不是平板地像新闻记录似地，说明这一主题，而是现实地形象地表达了这一主题。
    卓越的党的领袖，人民热爱的领袖，已经不是第一次出现在年画上，事实上，很多年画中都有毛主席的形象。有的是参观工厂，有的是接受少数民族代表的献礼，有的是和群众谈话，有的是检阅革命队伍，至少是在群众队伍中或礼堂中的一张画像。毛主席一再出现在这许多年画中是有原因的：这正说明群众十分愿意经常看见自己热爱的领袖，愿意从接触年画时，从领袖的画像得到鼓励，得到启示。美术工作者，十分懂得这些要求的正当，因此用艺术的创作来满足群众这一要求。——这是十分正确的。但是，能够像林岗同志这幅画一样，较好地刻划出人民领袖的性格和领袖与群众之间的关系，却不多见。而且在去年的年画中，甚至在外貌上也还有极其潦草的使读者失望的描绘。“党的好女儿——赵桂兰”里的毛主席的形象，不能说是毫无缺点的。——那只左手的姿式的目的性不够明确，造形不够自然，位置也不够自然，就是一个应该克服的缺点。可是从主要方面来看，这一作品确是生动地刻划了毛主席的性格、外貌与群众关系。我们当然不能说这一形象已经充分表现了毛主席的英明、坚毅种种性格的特征，但确是表现了他的专注、谦和、朴实、自然，关心群众热爱群众这一些重要的特征。作为造型艺术中的形象，虽然不能戏剧似地表现毛主席正在说什么话，但从他对待赵桂兰的态度中的确能使人联想起对革命工作的指示。这一与赵桂兰谈话的结构方式，能够使读者感到，好像自己就是正在感受毛主席的鼓励和教育。不论是否熟悉毛主席的仪态的读者，都能够从这一作品中多少体会到人民领袖可敬和可亲。
    作为这一作品的主角——赵桂兰，性格的描写也是现实的，合理的。作者没有把英雄加以神化，使之成为可望而不可即的超人，也没有忽视她在渴望会见而终于会见了自己的领袖时的心理描写。那种十分愉快的心情，对领袖的尊敬和热爱，认真听取指示而又毫不拘束的态度，十分符合年青的，虚心的，优秀的共产党员赵桂兰的性格，也十分恰当地刻划了她的身份。一提起赵桂兰，读者总会立刻关心到她的一只残废了的左手，作者没有忽视这一只具有特殊意义的左手。在这一作品上，它所处的地位很重要，但不是机械地事务地加以“说明”；透过色采显著的手套，能使人联想起可敬的英雄因为不惜个人牺牲，维护革命财产而得来的残疾。作为光荣的记号的残疾，却不像“中国妇女”某期的封面那样，对这一记号给予过分凸出的不必要的夸张。
    作为群像构图来看，这张年画中的肖像是丰富的。在许多中国共产党中央委员和英雄模范的肖像上，显然看得出作者经过了一番辛勤的设计和认真的描绘。尽管人物的位置安排得还不够完美，可是整个画面确是有宏伟与长于变化的特色。特别是田桂英、张树义这几位英模，不仅形象逼真，动作表情也具备了应有的合情合理的戏剧性。这和某些拼凑着一堆人物的所谓群众场面的构图相比较，分明显出作者对于构图作了应有的努力。在背景与道具的使用上，虽然复杂，却能造成情调统一的效果。就这方面来看，这幅画比起古元的“毛主席和农民谈话”，是更显得单纯和明快的。
    这一幅年画的可喜的显著特点之一，是线的适当运用。虽然线的掌握还不免有些稚弱，在物质感、立体感、空间感的表现上，和李琦、冯真的“伟大的会见”同具现实而又准确的特色。主要部分的线描十分洗炼，却不显得空虚；某些物像的线描十分细致也很繁复，却不显得杂乱和琐碎；这分明显出作者在努力吸取传统的中国美术的优点，而且分明显出已经获得了一定的效果。在这一作品中，作者不把线当成说明轮廓的死板的符号，也不是在线的趣味上浪费精力。我们只要把主要人物的脸、衣服和花盆、地毯等等作一比较，就不能不承认作者的正当的企图，把优良的传统技法运用到描绘新事物的任务中来的企图，获得了不使读者感到失望的成绩。在适应群众的欣赏趣味——清新和明确——的要求上，敢于断言：这种形式是值得提倡的形式之一，是能够发展的形式之一。
    不论内容与形式，这一幅画都有显著的成就。这种成就是今年以前的新年画所缺少的，因此我们有理由给予较高的估价。但是我们没有因为这些成就感到满足，我们有必要进一步要求作者更加努力，使这一作品能够更完善些。在这儿姑且不批评跳出来的黄色的椅子和过分吸人注意的修长的柱头等等表现方法上的毛病，仅就人物之间的关系的处理上提出一些意见来商讨。
    作为许多英雄模范参加着的庄严的大场面，现在这种处理法是不能完全令人满意的。因为还不够合理，不够自然，不够典型。如果说，这不是一幅人数众多的大构图，仅只是以毛主席来代表党对优秀的党员的关怀与教育，以赵桂兰来代表劳动模范对毛主席的敬爱，那末，前面所述的部分主要人物描绘的优点，已经保证了这一作品的成功。但是，既然这许多重要人物同时出现在一个画面上，就应该尽可能给予符合身份符合情节的位置，符合身份符合具体环境的动作、姿态、表情，应该尽可能集中地表达这一庄严的主题。可惜作者太强调多样而忽视了更合理的集中，（只要不形成构图的呆板无变化，更集中是必要的。）因此给读者一种印象：在场的某些人不关心毛主席和赵桂兰的谈话。——像普通交谊会一样，像在会议的休息室里一样，各谈各的问题。毛主席出现在这样一个会场上，不是平凡的事情。妇代会中，毛主席和李兆麟将军夫人握手，全场无声，几百个人的视线都集中了。毛主席和赵桂兰谈话，应该给在场的群众什么影响，完全可以想像的。假设在中央接见劳动模范的事实上真有各谈各的问题的片段的情节，作为艺术，作为本质地反映生活而不是记录现象的艺术，这种情节是缺乏代表意义的，不典型的，不值得强调的。作为党的好女儿，当她出现在毛主席的面前的时候，中央委员可能是、也应该是什么态度，我们可以从电影“攻克柏林”中得到参考。斯大林接见斯达哈诺夫工人阿略沙的场面，是既活泼又庄严，既多样又统一地描绘着的。不论苏联的习惯与中国的习惯有什么不同，现在这种结构方式不能算是完善地刻划着这一具有重大意义的场面，没有很好地刻划出人物的相互关系的。也许，作者在处理朱总司令背后的、正在谈话的两人，毛主席背后的、正在谈话的两人时，是为了和毛主席与赵桂兰的谈话有关相呼应，是借此表现后者在次要人物中的具体反映，加强效果；但这企图没有得到明确的表现。显然看得出作者在强调构图的变化，但这种变化妨碍主要情节的集中，不能合理地表现劳动模范们对于他们所衷心爱戴的、急于接近的、正在谈话的毛主席的注意。
    话又说回来，缺点，是难避免的。新年画还年青，那怕现在还有严重的缺点，只要发展地看待这些作品，对它们已有的成就应该给予较高的估价。我们虽然不应自满也不能自满，现有成就确是值得庆幸的；因为这些比较优秀的作品预示着新年画的壮阔前途。愿意为人民服务的全国的美术家能够深入地熟悉革命生活，认真研究群众的需要，适当运用和努力寻求各种新的表现方法，那末，一九五二年的新年画的成就将是更辉煌的。
