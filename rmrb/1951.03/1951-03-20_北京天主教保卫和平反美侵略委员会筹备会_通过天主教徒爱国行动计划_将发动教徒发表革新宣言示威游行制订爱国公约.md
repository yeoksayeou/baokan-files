Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The preparatory committee of the Beijing Catholic Patriotic Anti-American Aggression and Peace Preservation Committee held its first meeting on the 18th. Fifty-six representatives from twenty Catholic churches in Beijing, including Liu Fudong and Wang Ruji, attended. They spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, unanimously expressing their support for the renovation movement and passed a practical action plan, and elected eleven standing committee members of the preparatory committee.

The chairman of the meeting, Liu Fudong, delivered an opening speech, saying: Although American imperialism's aggression against Korea has been severely hit by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it has not only failed to learn its lesson, but has also become inhumane and released poison gas. The Chinese people, who have already stood up, will never tolerate such atrocities by American imperialism. We Catholics will not lag behind in loving our country. We will take practical actions to safeguard world peace and oppose American aggression.

Representatives from various churches spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea and implement the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Dong Jingnan, who is over seventy years old, said: "I am an old man and don't understand anything. But I know that American imperialism is invading us. It calls itself a civilized country, but it doesn't act like one. Now that we have good leadership and Chairman Mao, we are not afraid of American imperialism. Some people in the church are afraid of it and dare not express their patriotism. Can we, all the Catholics, not love our country because of these one or two people? We are Chinese, and China is our own. We must love China." Zhu Fuxiang, the principal of Guanghua Girls' High School, said: "Our Catholic patriotic action is lagging behind other religious groups. I want to boldly offer my opinions to the priests. They have not taken on the responsibility of leadership." Yan Desen, the principal of Nantang Middle School, said: "Some of us have patriotic enthusiasm, but we dare not express it because we are afraid of criticism from the parish priest and the bishop. In fact, Catholic doctrine tells us to love our country. We must be bold in loving our country." Chen Ruoyu from Guang'anmen Catholic Church said: "People generally believe that Catholics do not love their motherland, that entering the church means leaving the country. This is wrong. This is because our Catholics have no specific expressions of patriotism. Today, we must use concrete actions to express our patriotic enthusiasm. We must bring the spirit of today's meeting back to our respective parishes and promote patriotism to the church members." Wang Ti said: "The People's Government protects religion, and the Common Program clearly stipulates freedom of religious belief. We must support the People's Government." Xie Sijun from Furen Xitang said: "We must support the declaration of the Peace Council. The world is divided into two major camps, and we can no longer stand idly by."

After the representatives spoke, they immediately discussed and adopted a practical patriotic action plan, which includes launching Beijing Catholics to publish a renovation declaration, holding anti-American and aid-Korea demonstrations and parades, sending condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and formulating patriotic pledges, etc. At the end of the meeting, Liu Fudong, Wang Ruji, Zhu Fuxiang, Zhou Guozheng and other eleven people were elected as standing committee members of the preparatory committee.

　　北京天主教保卫和平反美侵略委员会筹备会
    通过天主教徒爱国行动计划
    将发动教徒发表革新宣言示威游行制订爱国公约
    【新华社十九日讯】北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会筹备会于十八日举行第一次会议，到会的有北京市二十个天主教堂的代表刘福栋、王汝楫等五十六人。他们在会上热烈发言，一致表示拥护革新运动，并通过了实际行动计划，选出了筹备会的十一位常务委员。
    会议主席刘福栋致开会词说：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，虽已接连受到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的严重打击，但它不但没有记取教训，反而灭绝人性，施放毒气。已经站起来了的中国人民决不能容忍美帝国主义这样的暴行。我们天主教徒爱国决不后人，我们要以实际行动来保卫世界和平，反对美国侵略。
    各教堂代表在会上踊跃发言，一致表示抗美援朝、实行三自运动的决心。七十多岁的董敬三说：“我是一个老朽，什么都不清楚。但我知道美帝国主义是侵略我们的。它自己说是文明国家，却不干人事。我们现在有了好的领导，有了毛主席，我们不怕美帝国主义。教会里有人怕它，不敢有爱国表现，我们全体教徒能因为这一两个人就不爱国吗？我们是中国人，中国是我们自己的，我们要爱中国。”光华女中校长祝福祥说：“我们天主教爱国行动落后于别的宗教团体，我要大胆地向神长们提意见，他们没有担负起领导的责任。”南堂中学校长阎德森说：“我们有些人有爱国热情，但不敢表现出来，原因是怕本堂神父批评，怕主教批评。其实，天主教义是让我们爱国的。我们要大胆地去爱国。”广安门天主堂陈若愚说：“一般人认为天主教徒不爱祖国，认为入了教籍就出了国籍，这是错误的。这是因为我们教徒没有爱国的具体表现。今天我们就要用具体行动来表现爱国热情。我们要把今天开会的精神带回各堂口去，向教友们宣传爱国主义。”汪禔说：“人民政府是保护宗教的，共同纲领明文规定宗教信仰自由。我们要拥护人民政府。”辅仁西堂谢斯骏说：“我们要拥护和平理事会的宣言。世界分成两大阵营，再不容我们观望了。”
    代表们在发言后，随即讨论通过了实际爱国行动计划，计划内容有发动北京市天主教徒发表革新宣言，举行抗美援朝示威大游行，慰劳中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，制订爱国公约等。会议最后选出刘福栋、王汝楫、祝福祥、周国正等十一人为筹备会常务委员。
