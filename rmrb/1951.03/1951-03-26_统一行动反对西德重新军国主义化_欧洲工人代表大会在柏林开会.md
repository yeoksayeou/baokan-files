　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th: The European Workers' Congress against the remilitarization of Germany opened in Berlin on the 23rd. More than 1,000 representatives of the working class from eighteen European countries attended the congress. The opening ceremony was presided over by Hahnig, a member of the congress's preparatory committee. The representatives unanimously elected a presidium composed of representatives from all European countries participating in the congress, with French representative Six elected as chairman of the congress. The sole item on the congress's agenda was: "The concerted action of the working people and trade unions of European countries to fight against the remilitarization of Germany." The congress began with a report on the above motion by West German representative Knötski. Knötski cited facts to show that Western countries, in violation of the Potsdam Agreement, are accelerating the remilitarization of West Germany. He also cited specific examples of West German workers fighting against remilitarization. Knötski concluded by pointing out that the European Workers' Congress against German remilitarization must become a tool for workers from various countries to exchange experiences and coordinate their efforts in order to achieve concerted action by the working class in the struggle against German remilitarization.
　　At the afternoon session of the congress on the 23rd, discussions began on Knötski's report. Representatives from France, West Germany, the German Democratic Republic, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, and Romania spoke, reporting on the struggles of the working classes in their respective countries against West German remilitarization.
　　Rélivet, the representative of the French chemical workers' union, said: German remilitarization means war, therefore, the struggle against German remilitarization is the most pressing issue. The French working class is fully aware of its responsibility in this struggle.
　　Ossietzky, a West German miners' representative and member of the Social Democratic Party, pointed out that coal from the Ruhr is being used for military production. He emphatically exposed the facts of collusion between the leading organs of the German Social Democratic Party, headed by Schumacher, and the warmongers, and declared that this party is no longer a party of the working class. West German representative Rist proposed the establishment of a European Workers' Council against German remilitarization. He called on Asian workers and European workers to fight together for peace.
　　Larisse, a metalworker from Paris, said: Western European workers must force their governments to stop expanding their armaments and preparing for war, which will cause a terrible increase in taxes and impoverishment of the working people.
　　The meeting was scheduled to continue on the 24th.

    欧洲工人代表大会在柏林开会
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：反对德国重新军国主义化的欧洲工人代表大会，于二十三日在柏林开幕。出席大会的有欧洲十八个国家工人阶级的代表共一千余人，开幕式由大会筹备委员会委员哈恩尼希主持。代表们一致选出了由参与大会工作的全体欧洲国家的代表们组成的主席团，法国代表西克斯当选为大会主席。大会议程上的唯一议案是：“欧洲各国劳动人民和工会一致行动，为反对德国重新军国主义化而斗争”。大会首由西德代表康涅茨基就上述议案作报告。康涅茨基列举事实，说明西方国家违反了波茨坦协定，正在加速使西德重新军国主义化，他同时也举出了西德工人为反对重新军国主义化而斗争的具体事例。康涅茨基最后指出：反对德国重新军国主义化的欧洲工人代表大会，必须成为各国工人交换斗争经验，配合努力的工具，以实现工人阶级反对德国重新军国主义化斗争中的一致行动。
    大会在二十三日下午会议上，开始讨论康涅茨基的报告。法国、西德、德意志民主共和国、荷兰、比利时、英国、保加利亚和罗马尼亚的代表都曾发言，报告了各国工人阶级为反对西德重新军国主义化而作的斗争。
    法国化学工人工会代表赖里维说：德国的重新军国主义化就意味着战争，因此，反对德国重新军国主义化的斗争是最迫切的问题。法国工人阶级充分认识到它在这个斗争中的责任。
    西德矿工代表，社会民主党党员奥西茨基指出：鲁尔的煤正用于军事生产。他着重揭发了以舒马赫为首的德国社会民主党领导机构与战争贩子勾结的事实，并宣布这个党已不再是工人阶级的政党了。西德代表里斯特建议成立欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化理事会。他呼吁亚洲各国工人和欧洲工人一同为和平而斗争。
    巴黎金属工人拉里赛说：西欧工人必须强迫他们的政府停止扩充军备和准备战争，这将引起赋税的可怕的增加和劳动人民的贫困。
    会议定于二十四日继续举行。
