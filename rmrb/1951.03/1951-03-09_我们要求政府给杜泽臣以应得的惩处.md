We demand the government give Du Zechen the punishment he deserves

To the Editor:

　　After reading "An Unreasonable and Illegal Affair" published in the People's Daily on January 28th, we were shocked. More than two years after liberation, there is still a capitalist like Du Zechen in Beijing who is so sinister, ruthless, and lawless, still wanting to treat workers as his slaves, arbitrarily insulting and beating them. Regarding workers' departures and stays, he wants you to come when he needs you and kicks you away when he doesn't. Now that we are liberated, the People's Government represents people from all walks of life. The relationship between workers and capitalists is free and equal. We will never allow people like Du Zechen to run rampant again. We demand that the government quickly handle this case and give Du Zechen the punishment he deserves; and order Du Zechen to return the wages of worker Li Jiping during the labor dispute period within a specified time. Finally, we ask enlightened capitalists to assist the government in implementing the "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China" and the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital.

### 我们要求政府给杜泽臣以应得的惩处

　　我们要求政府给杜泽臣以应得的惩处编辑同志：
    当我们读了一月二十八日人民日报发表的《一件违理违法的事》后，我们大吃一惊。解放了二年多的北京，竟还有杜泽臣这样阴狠毒辣、无法无天的资本家，还想拿工人当他的奴隶，任意侮辱打骂工人。对工人的去留是用得着时就要你来，用不着时就一脚踢开。现在解放了，人民政府是代表各阶层人民的，工人与资本家之间是自由平等的，决不容许像杜泽臣这一类人再横行下去。我们要求政府迅速处理这一案件，给杜泽臣以应得的惩办；限期要杜泽臣发还工人李际平在劳资纠纷期间的工资。最后我们要求开明的资本家一齐来协助政府执行《中华人民共和国工会法》和发展生产、劳资两利的政策。
