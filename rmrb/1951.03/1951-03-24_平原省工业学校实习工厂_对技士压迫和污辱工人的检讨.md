　　Pingyuan Provincial Industrial School Practice Factory
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Oppression and Humiliation of Workers by Technicians
    Comrade Editor:
    We have examined the criticisms of our factory made by Comrades Zai Yang and Ying Sheng in your newspaper on March 12th, as follows:
    Technician Zhang Shouyi of our factory, although from a worker background, has failed to understand democratic management due to his many years of service as a factory technician in the old society. He often uses intimidation to suppress workers. Despite our repeated education after liberation, he has made very slow progress. For example, around August of last year, when some female workers made too many tangles during warping, Zhang loudly rebuked them, saying, "What kind of warp packages are you making? Tangled, headless. If this were the old society, you would have been beaten to death long ago!" On another occasion, when female worker Chen Guilan had an argument with male worker Ji Qingyuan, Zhang ordered Chen Guilan to stop working without consulting the leadership. After we discovered this, we immediately criticized Zhang and immediately ordered Chen Guilan to resume work. Zhang Shouyi has a dissolute habit and a frivolous style, and his attitude towards female workers is not dignified. As mentioned in the criticism, he verbally abused female workers as prostitutes, kicked over female worker Hou Guihua's spooling machine, and gestured with his hands in front of female workers. These incidents all occurred before last autumn. This shows that Zhang Shouyi's old society habits are deeply ingrained, and on the other hand, it shows that our education of cadres and democratic management have not been sufficient. After seeing the criticisms from Comrades Zai Yang and Ying Sheng, Zhang Shouyi was also deeply ashamed and requested administrative punishment. After discussion with higher-level leaders, we decided to give him a demerit and strengthen inspection and education in his future work.
    Secondly, some of the criticisms made by Comrades Zai Yang and Ying Sheng differ slightly from the facts. We would like to explain as follows: (1) Our factory is the practice factory of the Pingyuan Provincial Industrial School, mainly for students to practice. Only a few machines are attached for production to subsidize the lack of practice fees. It is not exclusively engaged in production. (2) Since November of last year, the school administration stipulated that the wages of employees are calculated based on the government-set rice price, and the wages of workers are calculated based on the market price of wheat. This means that the monthly standard for converting employee wages is different. For example, in November of last year, the price of wheat for converting worker wages was 850 yuan per catty, and the price of millet for converting employee wages was 900 yuan per catty. In December, the rice price for converting employee wages was still 900 yuan, but the rice price for worker wages increased to 1,000 yuan. This is our implementation of the superior's regulations and is by no means an intentional reduction of the rice price for workers' wages. (3) Our factory has never had a body search system. In April of last year, our factory once discovered that steamed buns were missing from the kitchen and suspected that the cooks had stolen them. Once, when a cook was wearing an overcoat and going out, worker Du Furong searched the cook's body. After we discovered this, we criticized Du Furong. (4) Regarding the criticism that we often keep cash in the factory without buying raw materials, the county trade union also raised this point with us last year. After the factory administration and worker representatives jointly settled the accounts, it was confirmed that most of the factory's funds had been converted into inventory, and there was no waste of funds.

### 平原省工业学校实习工厂  对技士压迫和污辱工人的检讨

　　平原省工业学校实习工厂
    对技士压迫和污辱工人的检讨
    编辑同志：
    贵报三月十二日刊登了再扬、莹生二同志对本厂的批评，我们检查如下：
    本厂技士张守义，虽系工人出身，但因在旧社会充当工厂技师多年，不了解民主管理，经常用威吓的手段压制工人。解放以后虽经我们多次教育，但他进步依然很慢。如去年八月间有些女工在整经时，乱经管过多，张就大声斥责说：“看你们打的经管是啥？乱的乱，没头的没头，假使在旧社会早就打死你们啦！”又一次，女工陈桂兰因同男工计清源吵嘴，张未请示领导，就擅自叫陈桂兰停工。我们发觉后，即予张以批评，并立刻叫陈桂兰复工。张守义习性浪荡，作风轻浮，对女工态度不庄重。如批评稿中所提的辱骂女工是妓女，踢翻女工侯桂花的打线车，用手放在女工面前比划等，这都是去秋以前的事情。这一方面说明张守义沾染旧社会习气过深，另方面说明我们对干部的教育及民主管理做的不够。张守义见到再扬、莹生二同志的批评后，也惶愧无已，自请行政给以处分。经我们同上级领导研究后，决定给予记过一次，并在今后工作中对他加强检查与教育。
    其次，再扬、莹生二同志的批评中，也有几点与事实有些出入，谨说明如下：（一）本厂系平原省工业学校实习工厂，主要供学生实习之用，仅附设少数机子生产，以补助实习费的不足，并非专门从事生产者。（二）本厂职工工资米自去年十一月起，由学校行政上规定：职员概以政府规定米价计算，工人概以麦子市价计算。这样每月职工工资折价标准就不一样。如去年十一月份工人的工资，按麦子折价每斤是八百五十元，职员的工资按小米折价每斤是九百元；而十二月份职员的工资米折价仍是九百元，工人的工资米就增加至一千元了。这是我们执行上级的规定，绝非故意降低工人工资米的折价。（三）本厂从来没有搜身制度。去年四月间本厂曾一度发觉伙房丢了馍，怀疑炊事员偷的。有一次适逢炊事员披着大衣外出，工友杜福荣就在炊事员身上进行摸索。被我们发觉后，即批评了杜福荣。（四）关于批评我们厂内经常放着现金不买原料一节，在去年县工会也向我们提出这个意见。后经工厂行政与工人代表一齐结算账目，证实本厂资金已大部变成存货，并无浪费资金现象。
