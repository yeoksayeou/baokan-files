The patriotic labor emulation campaign of challenging the Ma Hengchang Production Group has gradually unfolded in the Beijing municipal hardware, public works, railway, and coal mining industrial systems. As of now, over 700 groups have responded to the challenge. Many groups have achieved new results in production. The Zhang Fengquan Group of machinists at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, since accepting the challenge, has continuously improved three tools: the sprayer forty-degree nozzle, the sprayer water inlet valve, and the spray gun insulator, by adhering to the technical research association system and constantly studying problems arising in the work. After more than 80% of the groups at the Liulihe Cement Plant accepted the challenge, they strengthened their technical learning and proposed a total of 41 rationalization proposals in one month, more than three times the number of rationalization proposals in November of the factory. After the Nie Yinchang Group of the No. 2 Telephone Bureau accepted the challenge, they immediately conducted a comprehensive inspection of the machines and formulated an inspection system to record the machine's operating status every hour. After Route 1 of the Public Bus Company accepted the challenge, there were also significant improvements in their work. From February 1st to 10th, vehicle utilization efficiency reached 77.58% (quota of 70%), the number of trips completed reached 116%, and on-time departures reached 96.88% (previously only about 80%), and breakdowns were reduced from more than 30 minutes per 100 kilometers to 16 minutes. After the Po Liqian Group of the Qinghe Mud Factory accepted the challenge, the production increased from 15.5 meters of carpet woven every ten hours to more than 18 meters, and a 100% first-class product rate was guaranteed. After the mechanics group of the Postal Bureau accepted the challenge, they strengthened the unity of the whole group, and the quality of bicycle repairs reached 100%, completely eliminating defective products.

However, due to the insufficient attention paid to this movement by some trade union cadres, the movement was hastily launched without prior discussion and research among the cadres. After accepting the challenge, they did not provide specific guidance or even abandoned leadership, which prevented the widespread development of this movement. For example, some factory workers proposed to accept the challenge and requested the leadership of the trade union, but the trade union cadres said, "We are currently engaged in re-elections and model worker evaluations, and we don't have time to engage in the challenge. Let's talk about it in a few days!" The challenge conditions of the Cai Youyu Group of the Electricity Administration Bureau were left unaddressed in the pocket of the trade union production committee member for twenty-one days. Some trade unions, although making general appeals, lacked specific leadership, resulting in the challenge becoming a mere formality. For example, the more common challenge conditions of the groups at the Liulihe Cement Plant were: "Respond to the call of the higher authorities and overfulfill the task," "Improve political, cultural, and technical level," "Strengthen unity and mutual assistance, and carry out criticism," and other slogan-like challenge conditions. Not only could they not enable the masses to grasp specific and clear goals, but they also could not check the implementation situation. In addition, some employees still had ideological concerns and incorrect views about challenging the Ma Hengchang Group. Because the trade union's publicity and education on the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group was insufficient, it was not resolved in a timely manner, such as: "The Ma Hengchang Group uses machines to manufacture finished products, and we can't use his experience." "The Ma Hengchang Group is a nationally renowned advanced group. How dare we challenge them?" Some workers even believed that "the challenge must be better than others to succeed," and used the most confident and already completed conditions as challenge conditions.

In order to correct the above shortcomings, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions has decided to strengthen the leadership of this movement and is preparing to convene a meeting of representatives of the groups that challenged the Ma Hengchang Group in the near future to exchange and summarize experiences in order to further promote this movement.

 　开展马恒昌小组竞赛
   首都七百余生产小组热烈应战
   某些工会干部对开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动重视不够，影响运动向前发展
    向马恒昌生产小组应战的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，在北京市五金、市政、铁路、煤矿等产业系统中已逐渐开展，截至目前为止，已有七百余小组应战。许多小组在生产上已获得了新的成绩。华北农业机械总厂车工间张风泉小组，自应战以来，因为坚持了技术研究会的制度，和随时研究工作中发生的问题，已连续改进了喷雾气四十度嘴、喷雾气进水瓦拉、喷枪绝口等三种工具。琉璃河水泥厂百分之八十以上的小组应战后，由于加强了技术学习，一个月来，共提出了四十一件合理化建议。较该厂十一月份合理化建议，增加了三倍多，电话二局聂荫昌小组应战后，立刻对机器进行了全面的大检查，制订了记录每小时机器运转情况的检查制度。公共汽车公司一路应战后，工作上亦有显著改进。二月一日至十日车辆运用效率达到百分之七七．五八（定额百分之七十），行车次数完成百分之一一六，发车准点达到百分之九六．八八（过去只能达到百分之八十左右），故障也由每百公里三十多分钟减少到十六分钟。清河制泥厂鄱立谦小组应战后，由每十小时织一五．五公尺毛毯提高到十八公尺以上，并保证了百分之一百的一等品。邮政局机工组应战后，加强了全组团结，修车（自行车）质量达到百分之百，已完全消灭废品。
    但由于某些工会干部对这一运动重视不够，在运动开始时，事先未在干部中进行讨论和研究，即仓促应战；应战后，又未进行具体指导，甚至放弃了领导，致使这一运动尚未能广泛开展。如有的工厂工人纷纷提出应战，要求工会领导，而工会干部说：“我们现在正在搞改选、评模，没功夫搞应战，过些日子再说吧！”电业管理总局蔡又玉小组的应战条件，被工会生产委员在口袋里压了二十一天没有处理。有的工会虽作了一般号召，但缺乏具体领导，结果使应战流于形式。如琉璃河水泥厂小组的应战条件中较普遍的是：“响应上级号召，超额完成任务”，“提高政治、文化、技术水平”，“加强团结互助，开展批评”等口号式的应战条件。不但不能使群众掌握具体明确的奋斗目标，而且也无法检查执行情况。另外，部分职工对向马恒昌小组应战还有思想顾虑和不正确看法，因工会对于马恒昌小组经验宣传教育不够，也未能得到及时解决，如：“马恒昌小组是用机器制造成品的，他的经验我们用不上。”“马恒昌小组是全国闻名的先进小组，怎敢和人家挑战？”甚至有的工人认为“应战一定要赛得过人家才行”，而把最有把握的早已完成的条件，做为应战条件。
    为纠正上述缺点，北京市总工会决定加强对这一运动的领导，并准备在最近召开一次向马恒昌小组应战的小组代表会议，交流和总结经验，以求把这一运动推进一步。
