More than 700 agricultural labor models in the North Sichuan District
	Signed covenants in response to Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's challenge
	Meng Qingyu Mutual Aid Team, an agricultural labor model in Heilongjiang Province, accepted the challenge and emphasized technological improvement. Luo Laigui, a famous agricultural labor model in Jiangxi Province, also made increased production plans to accept the challenge.
	Following the news that the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, an agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province, had proposed launching a patriotic production competition to mutual aid teams across the country, the 717 agricultural labor model representatives in the North Sichuan District who were attending a meeting to discuss this year's production responded enthusiastically. After detailed discussions, all the agricultural labor model representatives unanimously put forward the following four covenants in response to the challenge: (1) Actively study and publicize the people's government's various production policies, resolutely support the implementation of land reform, and completely eliminate the feudal system so that the land returns to the hands of the peasants. (2) Give play to the leading role of labor models in agricultural production, cultivate intensively and meticulously, and generally achieve four plowings and four harrowings; accumulate more fertilizer, weed diligently, and increase the yield of each mu of land by five jin of grain. (3) Expand the cotton field area, improve cotton planting technology, do not intercrop other crops in cotton fields, cultivate and hoe diligently, and apply more fertilizer. Use all indigenous methods and new pesticides and new agricultural machinery to prevent and control cotton pests and diseases, so that the task of increasing the total regional cotton production by 128 percent this year compared to last year can be successfully completed. (4) Increase the raising of sows. On the basis of an average of two pigs per three households in 1950, ensure that the average number of pigs raised per household increases to one by the end of 1951, in order to achieve the purpose of prospering sideline occupations and increasing fertilizer.

	Meng Qingyu Mutual Aid Team, a well-known agricultural labor model in Heilongjiang Province, responded to the production challenge proposed by the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team to mutual aid teams across the country. The terms of Meng Qingyu Mutual Aid Team's response to the challenge are: this year, guarantee that the total group's yield per mu reaches 333 jin, an increase of more than 26 percent compared to the normal yield. To achieve this goal, the whole group will plant more of the excellent varieties of "Man Cang Jin" and "Xibiwa" soybeans and "Kehua" wheat and "Dao Ba Qi" millet. The seeds of these crops were exchanged last winter and have been carefully selected and germination tested by the female group members. The group requires that 58 percent of the group's cultivated land be fertilized. Generally, seeds should be mixed with more kang hole ash and "blood meal," sorghum and millet should be applied with more manure, and soybeans should be mixed with black alum to ensure that the soybean seedlings develop strongly. Since last winter, there has been little snowfall in northern Manchuria, and there may be a spring drought this year. Therefore, the whole group will ensure that they step on the soil more during spring plowing, stepping on the ground five times with five people in front and behind, so that the soil does not dry out, can be moistened, and is drought-resistant. At the same time, they are also preparing to repair smooth water ditches to prevent waterlogging and flooding. During summer hoeing, the whole group will ensure that they hoe and till more times, maintaining last year's record of seven hoeings and seven tillings. In addition to the existing three weeding machines, they plan to add three more during summer hoeing, and at the same time mobilize eighteen women to weed in the fields. In order to ensure that they learn how to use the set of Soviet horse-drawn farm implements loaned to the group by the government, they have publicly recommended Li Changxiu and Song Xizhen, two smart and capable members of the group, to go to Qiqihar City to learn driving skills.
	Note: Meng Qingyu is from Yonghe Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province. He was selected as a special-class labor model in the province and attended the National Congress of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Labor Model Representatives last year. Under the leadership of Meng Qingyu, the whole group attaches great importance to improving farming techniques and carries out selection, trial planting, seed disinfection, fertilization, topdressing, and the use of new agricultural tools such as weeding machines for multiple hoeings and tillings every year. The group has also achieved the rational use of labor and has stipulated an annual model reward system to encourage the production enthusiasm of the group members. Therefore, the mutual aid team has continued to expand from an ordinary group with 11 members, 6 horses, and 300 mu of land in 1948 to a model mutual aid team with 35 members, 17 horses, and 855 mu of land. The average yield per mu of the whole group increased from 180 jin in 1948 to 315 jin last year, an increase of 40 percent compared to other local farmers. Therefore, the lives of all members of the group have gradually moved towards prosperity. Taking Meng Qingyu himself as an example: he has risen from a hired farmhand before the land reform to a middle peasant who now owns three carts, five horses, one cow, fifteen pigs, and more than 12,000 jin of surplus grain. Last winter, all seventeen members of his family, young and old, bought a new set of sanitary clothing in addition to buying 540 feet of cloth to make cotton clothes. Recently, he is building three large brick houses next to his old house. (Xinhua News Agency)
	Luo Laigui, a famous agricultural labor model in Jiangxi Province who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference last year, has recently formulated a full-year increased production plan to accept the challenge from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team. Luo Laigui proposed that this year, the four mu of land (two crops of rice) newly distributed during the land reform should produce 600 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 50 jin compared to last year; the four mu of land (one crop of rice) newly rented in should produce 315 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 30 jin compared to last year. In order to achieve the above-mentioned increased production goals, Luo Laigui guarantees: (1) Apply more fertilizer, planting red flowers (fertilizer grass) on all four mu of land distributed, and in addition to fertilizing these four mu of land, the excess fertilizer will be applied to the rented land. In addition, he will carry 130 dan of the most fertile pond mud, shovel 30 dan of turf, and apply all 20 dan of accumulated manure to the fields. (2) Cultivate intensively and meticulously. Last year, he only achieved three plowings, two weedings, and four harrowings. This year, all eight mu of his land will achieve three plowings, three weedings, and five harrowings. (3) Pull out the rice seedlings to eliminate pests and diseases. He does not have a cow and plans to exchange labor with households that have cows. In addition, he will reclaim two mu of wasteland to grow sweet potatoes. In terms of developing sideline production: his family now has a loom, and he plans to weave 250 pieces of cloth this year. In July and August, he will dig 60 dan of lotus roots. He will raise two pigs, sell one during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and use the proceeds from the sale of the pig, plus some money, to buy cattle and farm implements; he will sell the other one in December as next year's production capital. In addition to completing the above production plan, Luo Laigui also proposed to ensure the organization of labor mutual aid teams in his village to lead all the peasants in the village to work hard to increase production together.

　　川北区七百余名农业劳动模范
    订立公约响应李顺达互助组挑战
    黑龙江省农业劳模孟庆余互助组应战强调改进技术江西著名农业劳动模范罗来贵亦订出增产计划应战
    山西省农业劳动模范李顺达互助组向全国各地互助组提出开展爱国主义生产竞赛的消息传来后，川北区正在举行会议讨论今年生产的七百一十七名农业劳动模范代表纷纷响应。全体农业劳动模范代表经过详细讨论后一致提出了下面四条应战公约：（一）积极学习和宣传人民政府的各项生产政策，坚决拥护实行土地改革，彻底消灭封建制度，使土地回到农民手中来。（二）在农业生产上发挥劳动模范的带头作用，精耕细作，普遍作到四犁四耙；多积肥，勤除草，使每亩田地增产五市斤原粮。（三）推广棉田面积，提高种棉技术，棉田内不间种其他作物，勤耕锄，多施肥。利用一切土法和新农药、新农械防除棉花病虫害，使全区今年比去年增产皮棉百分之一百二十八的任务胜利完成。（四）增饲母猪。在一九五零年平均每三户饲猪二头的基础上，保证于一九五一年底增加到平均一户养猪一头，以达到繁荣副业增加肥料的目的。（新华社）
    黑龙江省著名的农业劳动模范孟庆余互助组，响应李顺达互助组向全国互助组所提出的生产挑战。孟庆余互助组的应战条件是：今年保证全组每亩产量达到三百三十三斤，较常年产量提高百分之二十六强。为达到这一目标，全组将多种优良的“满仓金”、“西比瓦”豆种及“克华”麦种、“刀把齐”谷种等作物。这些作物的种籽他们早已于去冬换好，并已由女组员们进行了精选和发芽试验。全组对农作物的施肥，要求达到全组耕地面积的百分之五十八。一般种籽要多拌炕洞灰和“血粉”，高粱、谷子多上大粪，大豆拌黑蘑矾，以保证豆苗发育茁壮。去冬以来，北满下雪较少，今年恐有春旱。因此全组将在春耕时保证多踩格子，种地时用五人前后共踩五遍，使土不发干，能够反润、抗旱。同时还准备修顺水濠，以防涝雨成灾。在夏锄期间，全组保证作到多铲多趟，保持去年七铲七趟的纪录。除现有的三台除草机外，准备夏锄时再增加三台，同时动员十八名妇女下地薅草。为保证学会使用政府贷给该组的一套苏联马拉农具，已公推组中精明能干的李长秀、宋希珍两人前往齐齐哈尔市学习驾驶技术。
    按：孟庆余是黑龙江省海伦县永合村人，曾被选为省特等劳动模范，出席过去年全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。在孟庆余的领导下，全组对于改进耕作技术非常重视，每年都进行选种、试种、种籽消毒、施肥、追肥及利用除草机等新式农具实行多铲多趟。该组还做到了合理使用劳动力，并规定有年终奖励模范制度，以鼓励组员的生产热情。因此互助组不断扩大，由一九四八年的十一名组员、六匹马、三百亩地的普通组，发展成为现在拥有三十五名组员、十七匹马、八百五十五亩地的模范互助组。全组每亩平均产量由一九四八年的一百八十斤增至去年的三百一十五斤，较当地其他农民增产百分之四十。因此，全体组员的生活，已由贫困逐渐走向富裕。以孟庆余本人为例：他已从土地改革前的雇农，上升为现在拥有三辆车、五匹马、一头牛、十五口猪及储有一万二千多斤余粮的中农。去年冬天，全家老幼十七口除各自买了一套新卫生衣外，还买了五百四十尺布做棉衣。最近，他正在过去的旧屋旁边，建造着三大间青砖房子。（新华社）
    曾出席去年全国劳动模范代表会议的江西省著名农业劳动模范罗来贵近已订出全年增产计划，向李顺达互助组应战。罗来贵提出今年要使土地改革时新分到的四亩田（二季稻），每亩产谷六百斤，比去年增产五十斤；新租入的四亩田（一季稻），每亩产谷三百十五斤，比去年增产三十斤。为达到以上增产目的，罗来贵保证：（一）多上，将分到的四亩田全部种上红花（肥田草），除在这四亩田里施肥外，多余的肥料即上到租入的田里。另外再挑一百三十担最肥的塘泥，铲三十担草皮，并将已积下的二十担大粪全部下到田里。（二）精耕细作。去年只做到三耕、两耘、四耙，今年他的八亩地要全部作到三耕、三耘、五耙。（三）拔掉禾木，免除病虫害。他没有牛，打算和有牛的户换工。此外，要开荒二亩种红薯。在发展副业生产方面：现在他家里有织布机一架，今年计划织布二百五十个。七、八月间挖藕六十担。养猪两只，中秋时卖掉一只，将卖猪所得，再加些钱用来买耕牛和农具；到十二月再卖掉一只，作为明年的生产本钱。罗来贵除完成上述生产计划外，并提出要保证组织起本村劳动互助组，带动全村农民一同努力增加产量。（新华社）
