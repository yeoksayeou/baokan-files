　　(II) Eight Things to Note During Spring Planting in North China

　　Editor's Note: The content of this article is not only suitable for the needs of North China, but also has reference value for spring planting work in other major administrative regions.

　　Spring planting in North China is about to begin. The Party and government leading organs in the five provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Suiyuan, as well as the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin, should quickly shift their work focus to spring planting production in order to strengthen their leadership over spring planting production and lay a good foundation for this year's agricultural bumper harvest campaign. In leading spring planting production, attention should be paid to the following tasks:

　　First, establish or improve village production committees or production representative conferences. The production committee or production representative conference must widely absorb labor models, technical experts, and experienced farmers to strengthen the specific leadership of spring planting production, and combine it with existing technical research associations or technical groups to promote spring planting production. This organization should be implemented throughout the year and become a strong organization at the village level to lead production.

　　Second, we should take advantage of the good opportunity of the beginning of spring planting to seize the rectification and widespread development of labor mutual aid organizations. All localities should select relatively mature model mutual aid groups in their locality (such as the Li Shunda mutual aid group in Shanxi) as typical examples and gradually promote them. In the development of the mutual aid movement, new content should be gradually enriched as possible. In areas where there are no mutual aid groups, various forms of mutual aid groups should be widely developed under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. In areas with an existing mutual aid foundation, the mutual aid groups should be consolidated and expanded on the basis of combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and further combined with the use of new agricultural tools, large agricultural tools, and other work to improve agricultural production technology. As for the new phenomena such as accumulation of grain and collective purchase of public agricultural tools that have emerged in mutual aid groups, they can be appropriately advocated in areas where farmers have a higher degree of organization and awareness, but they cannot be universally called for and promoted, let alone forced on general mutual aid groups.

　　Third, in areas with a relatively good production foundation and a relatively developed mutual aid movement, establish production plans for one household, one group, and one village under the principle of farmers' voluntariness, establish goals, and carry out bumper harvest competition activities, but resolutely oppose coercion, commandism, and formalism.

　　Fourth, in order to have a good start to spring planting work, it is necessary to start in a timely manner and conduct timely inspections. Spring planting loans should be given to farmers in a timely manner to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose. The task of cooperative societies to provide fertilizer loans should be completed in a timely manner, and the fertilizer should be delivered to farmers on time without delay. All regions should adjust and allocate superior seeds according to plan, and mobilize the masses to check, turn, and dry seeds, and soak and mix seeds. Cotton-growing areas should solve the problems of coal and livestock fodder, which is a common requirement in all cash crop areas and must be satisfactorily resolved. In terms of agricultural tools, blacksmiths and carpenters should be organized to repair agricultural tools. The new agricultural tools that are to be promoted this year should be loaned, sold, or rented to farmers in a focused and timely manner. All new agricultural tools must be tested, suitable for local farmers' use, and acceptable to farmers before they can be widely promoted. With the promotion of new agricultural tools, repair stations should be established to teach repair techniques. In terms of cadre preparation, short-term training courses should be set up to enable district and village cadres and labor models to learn simple scientific and technical knowledge such as preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, improving cultivation methods, and improving soil. In order to prevent plant diseases and insect pests, the masses should be mobilized to burn and hoe weeds and dig up insect eggs, and prepare insecticides, machinery, and medicines in a planned manner.

　　Fifth, systematically and vigorously help disaster areas complete their sowing tasks. All regions should earnestly pay attention to helping the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, and disabled soldiers to sow in a timely manner, and ensure that their land is not worse than that sown by ordinary people.

　　Sixth, areas with spring construction and spring repair (river construction, canal construction) should be carried out in stages and sections to resolve the contradiction between spring construction and spring repair and spring planting production; attention should be paid to mobilizing women to participate in spring planting to make up for the shortage of labor.

　　Seventh, on the basis of last year's credit purchases and fixed purchases, state-owned trading companies should now begin to conclude pre-purchase contracts for cash crops such as cotton and tobacco with farmers through cooperatives in order to promote the completion of cash crop sowing tasks.

　　Eighth, mobilize the masses to collectively loan and purchase waterwheels and dig wells and open canals.

　　"A year's plan starts in spring." All localities should, according to their local conditions, put forward specific plans that are completely suitable for local conditions, and organize forces to conduct in-depth inspections and assistance in order to better promote spring planting production.

### （二）华北春耕中应当注意的八件事

　　（二）华北春耕中应当注意的八件事
    编者按：本文内容不但适合于华北的需要，对其他各大行政区的春耕工作，也有参考价值。
    华北春耕即将开始，河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、绥远五省，北京、天津郊区的党政领导机关应迅速把工作重心转移到春耕生产上来，以便加强对春耕生产的领导，给今年农业丰产运动打下良好的基础。在领导春耕生产中，应注意以下工作：一、建立或健全村的生产委员会或生产代表会议。生产委员会或生产代表会议必须广泛吸收劳动模范、技术能手以及老农老圃参加，以加强对春耕生产的具体领导，并和已有的技术研究会或技术小组结合起来，以推进春耕生产。这一组织应贯彻全年，成为村级领导生产的强有力组织。
    二、应该乘此春耕开始的好时机，抓紧整顿和广泛发展劳动互助的组织。各地应选择本地比较成熟的模范互助组（如山西李顺达互助组）作为典型，逐渐推广。在互助运动的发展中，应视可能逐渐充实新的内容。在尚无互助组的地区，在自愿两利原则下，应广泛发展各种形式的互助组。在已有互助基础的地区，则应在农副业结合的基础上，进而与采用新农具、大农具、及其他提高农业生产技术的工作相结合，以巩固与扩大互助组。至于在互助组中新出现的积义仓和伙买公共农具等现象，可在农民组织程度与觉悟程度较高的地区，适当予以提倡，但还不能普遍号召推广，更不可强迫一般互助组照办。
    三、选择生产基础较好与互助运动较开展的地区，在农民自愿原则下，订立一户、一组、一村的生产计划，树立奋斗目标，开展丰产竞赛运动，但必须反对强迫命令与形式主义。
    四、春耕工作要能有一个良好的开端，就必须要及时动手，及时检查。春耕贷款应及时地贷到农民手中，要保证专款专用。合作社所负担贷放肥料的任务应保证及时完成，把肥料按时交给农民，不得有误。所有地区，均应按计划调剂优级种籽，并应发动群众检查翻晒种籽和浸种拌种。植棉区要很好地解决煤炭和畜草问题，这是所有经济作物区域中的普遍要求，必须给以满意的解决。在农具方面，应组织铁木匠修理农具，今年准备推行的新式农具应有重点地及时贷予、卖予或租给农民。所有新式农具，必须是经过试验，适合当地农民使用而农民又乐于使用者，始可广泛推行。随着新式农具的推广，必须酌设修理站，传授修理技术。在干部准备方面，应开办短期训练班，使区村干部和劳动模范学会防治病虫害、改良耕作法、改良土壤等简单的科学技术知识。为了防止病虫害，应即开始动员群众烧锄杂草，挖掘虫卵，并有计划地备妥杀虫药械药剂等。
    五、有计划地大力帮助灾区完成播种任务。所有地区都应确实注意帮助烈属、军属、工属和残废军人及时播种，而且要保证他们的地不比普通地播种的坏。
    六、有春工春修（河工、渠工）的地区，应分期分段进行，以解决春工春修与春耕生产的矛盾；并应注意发动妇女参加春耕，以补劳力之不足。
    七、在去年赊购、定购的基础上，国营贸易公司现在即应通过合作社，开始向农民订立棉花、烟叶等经济作物的预购合同，以促进经济作物播种任务的完成。
    八、发动群众伙贷伙购水车及打井开渠。
    “一年之计在于春”，各地应根据本地具体情况因地制宜提出完全适合当地情况的具体计划，并组织力量深入检查帮助，以便更好地推动春耕生产。
