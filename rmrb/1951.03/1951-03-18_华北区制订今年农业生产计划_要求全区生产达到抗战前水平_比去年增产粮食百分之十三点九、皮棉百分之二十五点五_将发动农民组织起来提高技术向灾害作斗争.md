　　The North China Region has formulated its agricultural production plan for 1951, requiring old liberated areas to exceed pre-War of Resistance production levels, and the entire region to fully reach pre-War levels. The North China Region exceeded its planned targets for grain and cotton production last year, with agricultural production in many areas approaching or reaching pre-War levels. According to this year's plan, the entire region will strive to increase production by 10% on the existing foundation and maximize yield per unit area. Grain production should increase by 13.9% compared to last year, the cotton planting area should be expanded by 19.7% compared to last year, cotton production should increase by 25.5%, and the area for economic crops such as tobacco and hemp should be expanded.
    To complete this bumper harvest plan, the region will carry out the following main tasks this year:
    First, universally and thoroughly carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea, oppose the United States' arming of Japan, and mobilize farmers to participate in the patriotic bumper harvest movement with practical actions of active production.
    Second, further implement the policy of organizing farmers, and combine organization with the improvement of agricultural techniques. At the same time, vigorously promote the development of various forms of mutual aid and cooperation in various places, such as jointly purchasing large farm tools, jointly digging wells, jointly buying waterwheels, cooperative afforestation, jointly engaging in sideline occupations, and establishing community granaries and public welfare funds, to further strengthen the economic ties between farmers.
    Third, universally launch a mass movement to improve agricultural production techniques and implement the policy of combining agricultural science and technology with the production experience of the broad masses of farmers to improve techniques. Based on existing conditions, universally carry out seed soaking, seed mixing, local seed selection, and local promotion of improved varieties; improve cultivation techniques, improve soil, increase fertilizer application, and improve fertilizer quality. Gradually transform old farm tools and focus on promoting new-style farm tools. To this end, county, district, and village cadres should be systematically trained to master agricultural production techniques, improve and promote existing technical research associations and technical promotion networks, strengthen experimental research work, open a large number of short-term training courses and vocational schools, and systematically train a large number of agricultural technical personnel.
    Fourth, further strengthen the struggle against various natural disasters, systematically and step-by-step carry out water conservancy projects, prevent floods, and focus on building small canals and waterwheels and wells to reduce drought. Carry out large-scale tree planting and afforestation, close hillsides for afforestation, and gradually overcome water and drought disasters. Promote scientific medicines and machinery, and combine them with mass-based local methods, local medicines, and manpower, and implement the policy of prevention being more important than cure to prevent and control diseases and insect pests.
    Fifth, led by labor models in rural areas, and on the basis of mass awareness and voluntariness, focus on formulating production plans for households, groups, and villages, and launch a bumper harvest competition movement. Combining the summarization of production work in each season, select labor models, model mutual aid groups, and model villages from the bottom up to establish agricultural bumper harvest goals and role models.
    Sixth, strengthen production leadership. Governments at all levels must establish the guiding ideology that leading agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural areas. Village-level should establish production committees, absorbing labor models and technical experts to participate, to strengthen the village's production leadership.
    In addition, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives in various places will also vigorously promote the sale of rural native products, surplus grain, and surplus cotton, and supply farmers with production and living materials.

### 华北区制订今年农业生产计划  要求全区生产达到抗战前水平  比去年增产粮食百分之十三点九、皮棉百分之二十五点五  将发动农民组织起来提高技术向灾害作斗争

　　华北区制订今年农业生产计划
    要求全区生产达到抗战前水平
    比去年增产粮食百分之十三点九、皮棉百分之二十五点五  将发动农民组织起来提高技术向灾害作斗争
    华北区已拟订一九五一年农业生产计划，要求老区超过抗战前生产水平，全区完全达到抗战前水平。华北区去年粮、棉生产计划超额完成，许多地区的农业生产已接近或达到抗战前生产水平。根据今年的计划，今年全区争取在现有生产基础上提高一成，并尽量提高单位面积产量。粮食生产要比去年增产百分之十三点九，植棉面积比去年扩大百分之十九点七，增产皮棉百分之二十五点五，并扩大烟、麻等经济作物面积。
    为完成这一丰产计划，该区今年将进行以下几件主要工作：
    第一，普遍深入开展抗美援朝，反对美国武装日本的运动，发动农民以积极生产的实际行动，参加爱国丰产运动。
    第二，进一步贯彻组织起来的方针，并使组织起来与提高农业技术相结合。同时，在各地大力提倡发展各种形式的互助合作，如伙买大农具，伙打水井，伙买水车，合作造林，伙搞副业，建立义仓和公积金等，以进一步加强农民之间的经济联系。
    第三，普遍开展群众性的提高农业生产技术运动，贯彻农业科学技术与广大农民生产经验相结合的改良技术的方针。根据现有条件，普遍进行浸种、拌种，就地选种，就地推广优良品种；提高耕作技术，改良土壤，增加肥量，提高肥质。并逐渐改造旧农具，有重点地推广新式农具。为此，要有计划地使县、区、村干部普遍掌握农业生产技术，健全与推广已有的技术研究会、技术推广网，并加强试验研究工作，大量开办短期训练班及专业学校，有计划地培养大批农业技术人材。
    第四，进一步加强向各种自然灾害作斗争，有计划有步骤地兴修水利，防治水患，并着重增修小型渠道与水车水井，以减轻旱灾。大量植树造林、封山育林，逐渐克服水旱灾害。推广科学药械，并与群众土法、土药和人力相结合，贯彻防重于治的方针，以防治病虫害。
    第五，由农村中的劳动模范带头，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，有重点地订立户、组、村的生产计划，并开展丰产竞赛运动，结合总结各个季节的生产工作，自下而上的评选劳动模范、模范互助组和模范村，以树立农业丰产的目标与榜样。
    第六，加强生产领导。各级人民政府要树立领导农业生产是农村压倒一切的中心工作的指导思想。村级应成立生产委员会，吸收劳动模范、技术能手参加，加强村的生产领导。
    此外，各地国营贸易部门及合作社亦将大力推销农村土产、余粮、余棉，供给农民生产和生活资料。
