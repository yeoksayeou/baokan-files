　　Spokespersons for the China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy Express Support for the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries
　　[From Our Own Correspondent] Spokespersons for the China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued statements respectively, expressing their support for the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government. The spokesperson for the China Democratic League stated: In order to severely suppress counterrevolutionary activities, ensure the interests of the people, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, the Central People's Government, in the spirit of combining suppression and leniency, promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries." We believe that only by resolutely implementing these regulations can we thoroughly defeat the conspiracy of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to disrupt our rear, consolidate the revolutionary order, and ensure the smooth progress of our Resist America, Aid Korea movement and land reform movement, as well as the accelerated progress of production and construction. In addition to expressing warm support for these regulations, the China Democratic League is willing to call on all members to actively assist the government in thoroughly implementing these regulations and resolutely suppressing counterrevolutionaries in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
　　The spokesperson for the China Association for Promoting Democracy stated: Recently, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries," which corrects the past deviations in handling counterrevolutionary cases. This is indeed an important guarantee for correctly implementing the policy of suppressing counterrevolutionaries in the Common Program. We call on all members of our association to join the people of the whole country in resolutely supporting this wise measure of the government, heighten vigilance, strictly guard against counterrevolutionaries from using all relationships to carry out their conspiracies of sabotage, and fight to resolutely suppress counterrevolutionaries in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, defend the fruits of revolutionary victory, and continue to complete the tasks of our country's people's democratic revolution.

　　民盟民进发言人表示拥护惩治反革命条例
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟、中国民主促进会发言人分别发表谈话，拥护中央人民政府公布的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”。民主同盟发言人称：中央人民政府为严厉镇压反革命活动，确保人民利益，巩固人民民主专政，本着镇压与宽大相结合的精神，颁布了“惩治反革命条例”。我们认为只有坚决执行这一条例，我们才能彻底击败美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮扰乱我后方的阴谋，才能巩固革命秩序，保证我们抗美援朝运动和土地改革运动的顺利开展与生产建设的加速前进。中国民主同盟除对这一条例表示热烈拥护外，并愿号召全体盟员积极协助政府，彻底实行这一条例，坚决镇压反革命分子，以巩固人民民主专政。
    中国民主促进会发言人称：最近中央人民政府公布“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，纠正了过去处理反革命案件中的偏向。这实在是正确实行共同纲领中镇压反革命政策的重要保证，我们号召本会会员应与全国人民一起，坚决拥护政府这一英明措施，提高警惕，严防反革命分子利用一切关系逞其阴谋破坏活动，为坚决镇压反革命，以巩固人民民主专政，保卫革命胜利成果，及继续完成我国人民民主革命任务而斗争。
