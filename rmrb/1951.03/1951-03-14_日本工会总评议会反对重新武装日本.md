　　Japanese General Council of Trade Unions Opposes Rearmament of Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch] The largest trade union in Japan, influenced by the Socialist Party – the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions – has been holding its national congress in Tokyo since the 10th. According to Agence France-Presse: The congress announced on the 11th that the association advocates: (1) The peace treaty with Japan must be a comprehensive treaty, not a separate treaty; (2) There should be no rearmament; (3) Rapid independence for Japan.
    Another dispatch: Shigezaburo Suzuki, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, told reporters on the 7th that the idea of ​​rearming Japan was "extremely stupid." Suzuki also expressed opposition to the plan for American troops to be stationed in Japan after a separate peace treaty. He was dissatisfied with Dulles' remarks after returning to the United States that "the majority of Japanese citizens agree that American troops should stay in Japan," using public opinion as a pretext. Suzuki said: This statement is "based on Yoshida's conversations and reports," and "This is Dulles' misconception of taking Yoshida's opinion as the opinion of the (Japanese) people."

　　日本工会总评议会反对重新武装日本
    【新华社十三日讯】日本社会党影响下的最大的工会——日本工会总评议会，自十日起在东京举行全国代表大会。据法新社消息：该会代表大会于十一日宣布，该会主张：（一）对日和约必须是一个全面和约，而不是一个单独和约；（二）不应该重新武装；（三）迅速给日本独立。
    又讯：社会党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎于七日告记者说：重新武装日本的主意是“极端愚蠢的”。铃木并表示反对单独媾和后美国在日本驻军的计划。他不满杜勒斯返美后所发表的“大多数日本国民赞成美军留驻日本”的假借民意的谈话。铃木说：这种说法是以“吉田的谈话与报告为根据的”，“这是杜勒斯把吉田的意见当做（日本）国民的意见的一种错觉”。
