Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th dispatch from TASS: The Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Heinrich Rau, published an article in *Pravda* entitled "Re-militarization Causes the Impoverishment of the Working People of West Germany," pointing out that from Stalin's conversation with the reporter from *Pravda*, the people of West Germany clearly understand that the reason for the decline in living standards is the result of the American imperialists dragging West German industry into arms production and the re-militarization of West Germany.

Heinrich Rau pointed out: West Germany has now sacrificed its civilian industry to supply raw materials and semi-finished products to the arms industry. Recently, the Western "High Commissioners" ordered the Bonn "government" to draft laws in the spirit of Nazi laws that stipulated the government's unrestricted power to allocate raw materials, as was the case during the last war. At the same time, the West German "Industrialists Association" has established numerous fascist-style organizations for allocating raw materials.

In the second half of last year, West German exports to the United States increased fourfold compared to the first half of the year, mainly strategic materials. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the occupying authorities ordered large quantities of Ruhr coal to be shipped to Western countries, resulting in the reduction of West German civilian industry and the people not being able to obtain fuel during the winter. After lengthy negotiations, American companies increased the price of 700,000 tons of German coal designated for export by 69% and then sold it back to West Germany.

This year, the burden on the working people will be even heavier. This year's occupation fees need to be increased by 1.65 billion marks due to the increase in US and British occupation forces. In addition, 350 million marks are planned to be allocated to equip West Germany's militarized "police." According to Bonn military industry experts, maintaining and equipping a mercenary army requires 12 billion to 15 billion marks annually. However, West Germany's entire budget is currently only 13 billion marks. Therefore, the Bonn puppets have adopted the method of continuously increasing taxes and raising prices to extract military spending. From June last year to early January this year, the West German food price index rose from 168 to 184 on average (with 1938 as 100), and the industrial product price index rose from 218 to 274. Actual wages therefore decreased by 14% last year.

However, in the German Democratic Republic, the development situation is the opposite. The industry that meets the needs of the people reached 112% of the 1936 level last year. Large-scale unemployment has been eliminated. Last year alone, the number of people employed in industry increased by 260,000, and wages increased by 13%.

Heinrich Rau pointed out that the reason why the German Democratic Republic has achieved these results is because it is engaged in friendly economic cooperation with the countries of the peace camp based on a peaceful policy. On this basis, its civil construction has received generous and effective assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

　　重新军国主义化的结果
    西德经济日益恶化
    德副总理在真理报撰文
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：德意志民主共和国副总理亨利·劳在《真理报》上以“重新军国主义化造成西德劳动人民的贫困”为题撰文指出，从斯大林对《真理报》记者的谈话中，西德人民清楚地理解到生活水准下降的原因是美国帝国主义者们把西德工业拖进军火生产和西德重新军国主义化的结果。
    亨利·劳指出：西德现在已经牺牲了民用工业，以原料和半制成品供应军火工业。最近，西方“高级专员”们命令波恩“政府”按照上次大战时规定政府有分配原料的无限制的权力的纳粹法律的精神起草法律。同时，西德“工业家联盟”已经设立无数法西斯式分配原料的组织。
    去年下半年，西德对美国的输出较上半年增加了四倍，其中主要是输出战略物资。去年年底和今年年初，占领当局下令把大量的鲁尔的煤运到西方国家去，结果西德民用工业因此缩减，人民在冬季中也得不到燃料。经过长期谈判后，美国公司将指定输出的德国煤斤七十万吨价格提高了百分之六十九后又卖回给西德。
    今年，劳动人民的负担将更加重。本年度占领费因美英占领军的增加而又需要增加十六亿五千万马克。此外，并准备拨出三亿五千万马克装备西德的军队化的“警察”。据波恩军事工业专家统计，为维持和装备一支雇佣军队，每年需要一百二十亿到一百五十亿马克。但目前西德全部预算也只有一百三十亿马克，因此，波恩傀儡们采取了不断增税和提高物价的方法来榨取军费。自去年六月至今年一月初，西德食物价格指数平均从一六八上涨到一八四（以一九三八年为一百），工业品物价指数从二一八上涨到二七四。去年实际工资因此减少了百分之十四。
    但是，在德意志民主共和国，发展情况适与此相反，适应人民需要的工业，去年达到一九三六年水平的百分之一百一十二。大规模失业的现象已经消除，去年一年，工业上就业人数增加了二十六万人；工资增加了百分之十三。
    亨利·劳指出，德意志民主共和国获得这些成绩的原因，是由于它根据和平政策，与和平阵营各国从事友好的经济合作，在这一基础上，它的民用建设得到了苏联和各人民民主国家慷慨而有效的援助。
