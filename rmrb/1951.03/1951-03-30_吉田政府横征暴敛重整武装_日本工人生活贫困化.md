　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 27th (TASS dispatch): News disclosed in Japanese newspapers proves that the material conditions of Japanese workers have become extremely difficult due to the burden of huge expenses required to restore Japanese militarism.

　　The *Japan Economic News* recently wrote, when discussing the survey conducted by the Tokyo municipal government's statistics department: In 1950, the average tax paid by each Japanese family was almost twelve times that of 1939. The newspaper stated: "Currently, taxes are the largest expense in general households, second only to expenses for food."

　　According to the *Asahi Shimbun*, the Japanese government recently received instructions from MacArthur's headquarters to revise local tax laws in order to increase local taxes. The newspaper pointed out: The total amount of income tax collected in the new fiscal year will increase by 28.9 billion yen compared to last year. This sharp increase in taxes will further reduce the already low real wages of the working people.

　　According to the *Friend of Peace*, many people in Tokyo have to sell even their rationed rice in order to pay taxes. The *Mainichi Shimbun* wrote: The Tokyo Municipal Government's Tax Bureau has decided to mobilize 630 officials to collect a huge amount of 4 billion yen in unpaid taxes and hold public auctions. The newspaper pointed out that, up to now, only 9.5% of the property tax stipulated in Tokyo in 1950 has been collected.

　　In addition to heavy taxes, the Japanese working people also suffer from the high prices of food and industrial products. In this regard, the opinion poll conducted by the *Mainichi Shimbun* among housewives across the country is very interesting. One of the questions in the survey was: Considering your family income, are you satisfied with the current market prices? 77.7% of housewives answered: "Prices are unbearably high."

　　The wages of the working people are only enough to keep their families living a half-starved life.

　　Due to these difficulties, many working people are unable to send their children to school. The *Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun*, in reporting on the survey conducted by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Education, wrote: 309,006 elementary school students and 264,709 middle school students did not attend school for a long period in 1950 because many of them "had to help their families with work." The actual number of children not attending school is much larger than this number. *Democratic Japan* pointed out: If the materials of this survey included homeless children, then the total number of children not attending school would approach one million.

　　The increase in the number of induced abortions among Japanese women is another proof that the difficult material conditions of the people make many working people unable to raise their children. The *Tokyo Times*, referring to the survey materials published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, wrote: In 1950, more than two million Japanese women had abortions.

　　Suicides by people who are driven to despair by terrible environmental difficulties are also common in Japan. According to reports, from January to May 1950, in Tokyo alone, there were approximately 100 suicides every month.

### 吉田政府横征暴敛重整武装  日本工人生活贫困化

　　吉田政府横征暴敛重整武装
    日本工人生活贫困化
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社东京二十四日讯：日本报纸上披露的消息证明：由于恢复日本军国主义所需的巨额经费的负担压在身上，日本工人的物质条件已极为困难。
    《日本经济新闻》报最近在论及东京市政府统计机关所进行的调查时写道：在一九五○年中，平均每个日本家庭所缴纳的赋税，几乎为一九三九年的十二倍。该报称：“目前赋税在一般家庭中是仅次于用于粮食方面的费用的最大费用。”
    据《朝日新闻》报道，日本政府最近曾接到麦克阿瑟总部的训令，要它修改地方税法，以便增加地方赋税。该报指出：在新的会计年度中所征收的所得税总额，将比去年增加二百八十九亿日元。税额的这种剧增，将使劳动人民本已很低的实际工资降得更低。
    据《和平之友》报报道，东京有许多人为了缴纳赋税，连配给米也不得不拿出来卖。《每日新闻》写道：东京市政府税务局已决定动员六百三十个官员去征收数达四十亿日元之巨的未缴纳的赋税，并举行公开拍卖。该报指出，到现在为止，东京在一九五○年中规定缴纳的房捐只征收到百分之九点五。
    除了重税以外，日本的劳动人民还受到食品和工业品价格昂贵的痛苦。在这方面，《每日新闻》在全国各地的家庭主妇中所举行的民意测验是很有趣的。测验中的一个问题是：从家庭收入来看，你们对目前的市场物价感到满意吗？百分之七十七点七的家庭主妇回答说：“物价高得使人受不了。”
    劳动人民的工资只够让他们的家庭过着半饥半饱的生活。
    由于这种种困难，许多劳动人民无力送他们的孩子进学校。《东京日日新闻》在报道厚生省和文部省所进行的调查时写道：三十万九千零六个小学生和二十六万四千七百零九个中学生，在一九五○年中的一个很长的时期中没有上学，因为他们当中有许多人“必须帮助家庭干活”。未上学的孩子的数目实际上比这个数目还要大得多。《民主日本》指出：如果这种调查的材料包括无家可归的孩子在内的话，那么，未上学的孩子的总数将接近一百万。
    日本妇女被迫堕胎事件的增多，是人民的艰难的物质条件使许多劳动人民无力养育他们的孩子的又一证明。《东京时报》在提到厚生省公布的调查材料时写道：在一九五○年中，有两百万以上的日本妇女堕了胎。
    因环境困难得可怕而陷于绝望的人自杀的事，在日本也屡见不鲜。据报载，在一九五○年一月至五月中间，仅在东京一地，每月就有约一百起自杀的事件发生。
