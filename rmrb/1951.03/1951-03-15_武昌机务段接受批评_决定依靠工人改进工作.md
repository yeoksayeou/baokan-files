Reaction to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

　　Wuchang Locomotive Depot Accepts Criticism
     Decides to Rely on Workers to Improve Work
       Editor:
    We sincerely accept Comrade Zeng Xianbang's criticism of the shortcomings in our depot's work, published in the "Reader's Letters" section of your newspaper on February 14th. Comrade Zeng Xianbang's responsible criticism, showing concern for the people's cause, points out a new path for our future work. In the past, we did not know how to rely on the masses and did not effectively implement the policy of enterprise management democratization. This was reflected in a leadership style that was aloof and domineering. In today's people's enterprises, such a style is not allowed to exist. From now on, we must face the masses and promptly solve the difficulties of our fellow workers. We have now provided workers with masks, gloves, work clothes, rubber boots, and goggles for safety and hygiene. There have also been improvements in production. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to accidents. Now, we have established an accident research group specifically responsible for studying the causes of accidents and preventing them. There has also been a positive change in the phenomenon of wasting coal. In February 1951, the depot's coal consumption was 17% less than the bureau's set standard.

    In addition, some points in Comrade Zeng Xianbang's criticism need further clarification. Regarding the section that our depot "lacks a reward and punishment system, and workers feel that doing more is superfluous," the actual situation is not entirely like this. Today, as long as workers are skilled and willing to work hard, they will not be buried. For example, Zhang Wanxing, a national model worker for workers, peasants, and soldiers, was formerly a worker and is now promoted to transportation director. Regarding the issue of salary increases for cadres, in fact, Depot Chief Su Shilong's salary did not change after his promotion in February last year, and it was only increased when the Hengyang Railway Bureau adjusted salaries in December. The reason why foremen Peng Yaoqing and Zhang Debiao did not receive salary increases after their promotion is because the Hengyang Railway Bureau's salary standard principle is "those with high salaries remain unchanged, and those with insufficient salaries are raised." The salaries of Peng Yaoqing and Zhang Debiao already exceeded the standard, so they were not increased again. Naturally, the salary system for employees of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot still has some shortcomings, but correcting the unreasonable salary system of the past cannot be done in a short period. We are now working on technical standard verification to further resolve salary issues rationally.

    The heads of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot accepted this criticism, conducted a self-examination ideologically, summarized the mistakes made in past work, and recognized their shortcomings. In the future, we must establish the idea of relying on the masses, carry out rationalization proposal campaigns, listen to the opinions of our fellow workers at any time, and improve our work with the help of the vast number of employees.

### 武昌机务段接受批评  决定依靠工人改进工作

　　武昌机务段接受批评
     决定依靠工人改进工作       编辑同志：
    贵报二月十四日“读者来信专页”发表曾宪邦同志对我段工作中存在缺点的批评，我们是诚恳接受的。曾宪邦同志这种对工作负责关心人民事业的批评，给我们今后的工作指出一条新的道路。过去由于我们不懂得依靠群众，也未很好的执行企业管理民主化的政策，表现在领导方法上是一种高高在上盛气凌人的作风。在今天人民的企业中，这种作风是不允许存在的。今后我们要面向群众，及时解决工友的困难。现在我们在安全卫生设备方面，已经发给工友们口罩、手套、工作衣、胶皮靴和护目眼镜等。生产方面也有了改进。过去我们对事故是不重视的，现在成立了事故研究组，专门负责研究发生事故的原因和防止的办法。浪费煤的现象也有了好的转变，一九五一年二月份，全段煤的消耗量按局定标准节省了百分之十七。
    此外，在曾宪邦同志的批评中，有些地方还须加以说明。关于本段“缺乏奖惩制度，工人认为多干也是多余”一节，实际上情况还不完全是这样，今天，只要是有技术肯干的工人，是不会被埋没的。如：全国工农兵劳动模范代表张万兴，过去是工人，现在提升为运输主任。关于干部加薪问题，实际上，段长苏世隆去年二月升职之后，薪金并未更动，一直到十二月衡阳铁路局调整工资时才增加的。至于工长彭耀卿及张德标两人升职没有加薪的原因，是由于衡阳路局的工薪标准原则是“高的不动，不足的提高。”彭耀卿和张德标两人的工资已超过标准，故此没有再增加。自然，武昌机务段员工的工薪制度目前还存在着某些缺点，但要纠正过去不合理的工薪制度，不是一个短时期可以搞好。现在，我们正在作技术标准查定工作，准备进一步合理解决工资问题。
    武昌机务段党、政、工、团的负责人，接受这次的批评，在思想上作了检查，总结了过去工作上所犯的错误，认识到自己的毛病。今后我们一定要树立依靠群众的思想，开展合理化建议运动，随时听取工友的意见，在广大职工的帮助下来搞好工作。
                武昌机务段长  苏世隆
                 工会主席  刘维祺
