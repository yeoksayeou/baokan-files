　　Chinese Esperanto Movement

　　Esperanto is an international auxiliary language created by Zamenhof of Poland. It was introduced to China more than forty years ago, dating back to 1887.

　　After the "September 18th" Incident, with the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement, the Chinese Esperanto movement, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, quickly became a part of the Chinese New Culture Movement.

　　In 1932, Chinese left-wing Esperantists formed the "Chinese Proletarian Esperantist League." Under the slogan "Use Esperanto for the liberation of China," they published periodicals such as *Chinese Proletarian Esperantist Newsletter*, *The World*, and *China Roars*, reporting to foreign countries on the heroic struggles of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, as well as the Chinese people's anti-Japanese and national salvation movement. These reports were widely translated and published in progressive newspapers and magazines in the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany, and France.

　　In addition, Chinese Esperantists were the first to introduce the Chinese language Latinization scheme to China. The Chinese New Writing Movement after 1934 was launched with the active promotion of Chinese Esperantists.

　　After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chinese Esperantists published periodicals such as *Towards a New Stage* and *Justice* in Guangzhou, and *Eastern Voice* and *Far East Messenger* in Hong Kong. They all reported to foreign countries on the heroic War of Resistance Against Japan by the Chinese people. At the same time, they also organized Esperantists from various countries to actively assist the Chinese people in their war of resistance. For example, they organized a Chinese War of Resistance exhibition in the Netherlands and launched a movement to save Chinese war orphans in many countries.

　　In Yan'an, the sacred place of anti-Japanese democracy, Esperantists published *Yan'an Esperantist* and compiled Esperanto readers. The Yan'an Esperanto Society was once a part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association.

　　In 1939, Chinese Esperantists published the bi-monthly *China Reports* in Chongqing to promote the War of Resistance Against Japan, and published many books of literature and songs introducing the War of Resistance to foreign countries.

　　However, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Chinese Esperanto movement, like other progressive cultural movements, was constantly suppressed; many Esperantists were imprisoned and massacred.

　　The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the founding of the People's Republic of China gave the Chinese Esperanto movement tremendous vitality and opened up a vast and free world for it. After the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai Esperanto Association was the first to be restored, and the Esperanto movement in various places was also revived successively.

　　In 1950, the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing, in order to meet the needs of the new China's international propaganda, published the Esperanto monthly *People's China*, which contained texts about various aspects of the new China's construction and the anti-aggression struggle, and was welcomed by readers in various countries. In a short period of less than a year, its distribution has spread to more than thirty major countries across the five continents. On average, 50% of the materials it publishes are published in newspapers and periodicals of various countries or utilized in other ways.

　　Under these circumstances, Esperantists across China felt the need to concentrate their efforts to intensify their work. Therefore, last year they established the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Esperanto Association. During the preparation period, it has carried out liaison work with Esperantists in more than twenty countries and conducted international propaganda.

　　On March 11, 1951, the All-China Esperanto Association was officially established in Beijing. Chinese Esperantists have their own national organization for the first time in Chinese history. Under the leadership of the organization, they will strive to serve our great motherland with Esperanto and work for lasting world peace.

### 中国世界语运动

　　中国世界语运动
    世界语是波兰柴门霍夫所创造的国际补助语，问世于一八八七年，被介绍到中国来已有四十多年的历史。
    “九·一八”事变后，随着中国革命运动的发展，中国世界语运动，在中国共产党的领导下，很快地就成为中国新文化运动的一环。
    一九三二年，中国的左翼世界语者组成了“中国无产者世界语者联盟”，在“为中国的解放而用世界语”的口号下，出版了《中国无产者世界语通讯》、《世界》和《中国怒吼》等刊物，向国外报道中国工农红军和东北抗日联军的英勇斗争以及中国人民的抗日救亡运动。这些报道，曾被广泛译载于苏联、日本、德国和法国的进步报刊上。
    此外，中国世界语者曾首先把中国语写法拉丁化方案介绍到中国来。一九三四年以后的中国新文字运动，就是在中国世界语者积极推动之下开展起来的。
    抗战开始后，中国世界语者在广州出版了《走向新阶段》、《正义》，在香港出版了《东方呼声》与《远东使者》等刊物。它们都向国外报道了中国人民的英勇的抗日战争，同时，它们还组织了各国世界语者对中国人民抗战的积极援助，例如在荷兰曾组织了中国抗战展览会，并在许多国家发动了救济中国难童的运动。
    在抗日民主圣地的延安，世界语者出版了《延安世界语者》，编印了世界语读本。延安世界语学会，曾是陕甘宁边区文化协会的一个组成部分。
    一九三九年，中国世界语者在重庆出版了宣传抗战的《中国报导》半月刊，并出刊了许多向国外介绍中国抗战的文艺及歌曲的书籍。
    可是，在国民党反动统治之下，中国的世界语运动，也和其他的进步文化运动一样，不断遭受压迫；不少世界语者被监禁与屠杀。
    中国人民解放战争的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，给中国世界语运动以巨大的活力，并在它的面前展开了广大辽阔的自由天地。在上海解放以后，上海世界语者协会就首先恢复起来，各地的世界语运动也先后复兴。
    一九五○年，北京外文出版社适应新中国国际宣传之需要，出版了世界语月刊《人民中国报道》，它所刊载的有关新中国各方面的建设及反侵略斗争的文字，受到了各国读者的欢迎。它在短短的不到一年的时间内，发行已遍及五洲三十几个主要国家。它所刊载的材料，平均已有百分之五十为各国报刊所刊载或以其他方法来加以利用。
    在这种情势之下，全中国世界语者感觉到有集中力量加紧工作的必要。所以去年他们成立了中华全国世界语协会筹备会。在筹备期间它已经和二十几个国家的世界语者进行了联络工作，并进行了国际宣传。
    一九五一年三月十一日，中华全国世界语协会在北京正式成立。中国世界语者在中国历史上第一次有了自己的全国性组织，他们将在组织的领导之下，努力用世界语为我们伟大的祖国服务、为争取世界持久和平而工作。
