    Soviet Scientists Condemn the United States for Manufacturing Bacteriological Weapons
    Professor Imshenetsky, a prominent Soviet scientist and Director of the Institute of Microbiology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, made the following statement to a TASS correspondent regarding MacArthur's large-scale production of bacteriological weapons to poison the Korean people and army: MacArthur's preparation for large-scale production of bacteriological warfare weapons cannot but arouse the indignation of the broad masses of the Soviet people. All the efforts of Soviet microbiologists are directed at fighting against the various bacteria that cause disease, and seeking new antibacterial drugs to treat diseases; while American imperialism spends huge sums of money to create "death factories," where large quantities of bacteria of plague, anthrax, typhoid fever and other diseases are cultured and manufactured. With righteous indignation, Soviet microbiologists warn American scientists: biologists or physicians who become organizers of bacteriological warfare are not worthy of being called scientists, but are criminals.

    Spring Planting Completed in Several Southern Regions of the Soviet Union
    Several southern regions of the Soviet Union have completed the sowing of spring crops. This year, tractors were used for more than 90 percent of spring planting. Many places have organized all-day shifts for farm work. Excellent tractor drivers cultivate 150 to 190 hectares of land (approximately 2,250 to 2,850 Chinese mu) per shift, exceeding the work quota by two to three times.

    Peace Conference Held in Sofia
    The Sofia City Peace Committee held a peace conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, on the 22nd. The working people attending the meeting held up placards and flags, calling for signatures on the World Peace Council's declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and to unite more closely around Stalin, the great standard-bearer of peace and leader of progressive mankind. Mass meetings to defend peace have been held in other Bulgarian cities such as Vidin and Vratsa.

    Sixth UN General Assembly Scheduled for Paris in November
    The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the 20th to discuss the venue of the sixth session. Under the insistence of the Soviet Union and other delegations, the Assembly finally adopted a resolution by a majority vote to hold the sixth session in Paris on November 6 this year.

    Czechoslovak Cultural Delegation Discusses Impressions of Visit to China
    The Czechoslovak Cultural Delegation returned to Prague on the 18th after a three-month visit to China, and held a press conference in Prague on the 22nd. Dr. Prusek praised the high degree of calmness, optimism and self-confidence shown by the Chinese people in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

    Broad Mass of British Labour Party Members Oppose Arming West Germany
    The Northfield Labour Party organization near the North Birmingham constituency in Britain recently passed a resolution stating that the rearmament of Germany is an "obstacle to peace." The Labour Party branch organizations in Solihull and Hall Green in the North Birmingham area have sent protests against the government's foreign policy to the Labour Party headquarters at Transport House in London. The Yarmouth Labour Party branch organization passed a resolution urging the government to declare that expanding armaments increases the risk of war.
