Further Improve the Agricultural Economy of Northwest Fraternal Nationalities
    Zhang Zhong, Deputy Director of the Northwest Animal Husbandry Department

    The Northwest is a multi-ethnic region, with over seven million fraternal nationalities, accounting for more than a quarter of the total population of the region. Xinjiang Province alone has thirteen nationalities including Hui, Mongolian, Manchu, Uyghur, Tatar, Tajik, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Sibe, Solon, Russian and Han. They have different languages, scripts, lifestyles, customs, religious beliefs and habits. The main economic characteristic that differs from agricultural areas in the interior is that most fraternal nationalities are engaged primarily in animal husbandry or a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. Among them, the Mongolian, Kazakh, Tajik, and Kyrgyz people of Xinjiang, and the Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots of Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia mostly still live a nomadic life. "The sky is vast, the plains are boundless, and when the wind blows, the grass bends low to reveal cattle and sheep." This beautiful picture is painted by countless beloved fraternal nationalities with their hardworking hands, generation after generation. However, under long-term feudal reactionary rule, especially after decades of brutal exploitation and frantic plunder by Ma bandits, their lives are very poor. Due to grassland destruction, epidemics, and high livestock mortality rates, coupled with the inability to sell hides and furs, the number of livestock has sharply decreased. In the past ten years, the number of livestock in Qinghai has decreased by 40%, horses in Ningxia have decreased by 70%, cattle and camels have decreased by 50%, and sheep have decreased by 30%. Livestock in Xinjiang have decreased by 24%. Wool has almost become waste. As a result, the lives of herdsmen have deteriorated. The Golog people, who live in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai, even live by eating "jiao ma" (a kind of wild grass planted by people) and drinking cow blood.

    Since liberation, as a result of our correct implementation of ethnic policies, trade policies, and various animal husbandry and agricultural facilities, the economic lives of these fraternal nationalities have begun to improve.

    Based on the Common Program and the experience of the past year, the main aspects of doing this work well are as follows:

    First, open up sales channels for livestock products and invigorate material exchange. Everyone knows that when wool is expensive, people like to raise sheep, and historical facts have fully proven this point. In the year since liberation, the thing that herdsmen have felt most happy about is the rise in the price of wool. Taking Xinjiang as an example, the price of wool has increased from 600 yuan (new currency) per catty to 1,400 yuan. In the past, a brick of tea could be exchanged for four sheep, but now it can only be exchanged for one sheep. In the past, one catty of summer wool could be exchanged for one catty of flour, but now it can be exchanged for four catties of flour. The prices of other items such as sheep intestines and sheepskins have increased by about five times, and the situation is the same in Qinghai and other places. According to statistics from the Northwest Trade Department, in the past year, under the leadership of state-owned trade in Xinjiang Province, the purchase of native products included 450,000 sheep, 26,000 cattle, 690,000 sheep, cattle, horse, and animal hides, 3,520 tons of wool, camel hair, and goat cashmere, 6,500 tons of wheat, and 50,000 kilograms of cotton. In total, this can increase the income of farmers and herdsmen in Xinjiang by approximately 350 million Xinjiang yuan, equivalent to 13.5 billion RMB. In return, a large number of living and production materials were exchanged. From the interior alone, over 570,000 bolts of cloth and 490,000 bricks of tea were transported, and 430,000 meters of cloth, tractors, and 1,397 plows were imported from the Soviet Union, along with many other equipment and materials. The herdsmen said in unison: "Chairman Mao is our Great Living Buddha!" They bought Chairman Mao's photos and enshrined them in their shrines. This reflects the successful policy of uniting fraternal nationalities by purchasing livestock and native products at reasonable prices and supplying the pastoral areas with the cloth, grain, tea, hats, and other daily necessities they need. In the future, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen the trade work led by state-owned trade organizations, organize cooperatives and private merchants, adopt flexible methods such as mobile trade teams, overcome transportation difficulties, penetrate into pastoral areas to carry out trade work, implement a reasonable price policy, and strive to conduct product inspections, graded price differences, reward herdsmen for improving the quality of livestock products, and eliminate adulteration and fraud to facilitate export sales.

    Second, pay attention to livestock disease prevention and health care. This includes two aspects of work: A. Disease prevention: Last year, in this region, focusing on animal husbandry areas, a total of 1.92 million head of cattle were preventively inoculated against rinderpest, anthrax, hemorrhagic septicemia, bovine emphysema, and various livestock diseases were treated and inspected. More than 1.4 million cc of various vaccines and 2.28 million cc of various serums were produced. This is something that the Kuomintang reactionary rule had not done for more than 20 years, and we have successfully completed it. This year, we will continue to implement the policy of "prevention first, treatment secondarily," plan to strengthen the mass work of veterinary disease prevention stations and work teams, and combine livestock insurance to carry out a wide range of disease prevention campaigns, striving to basically eliminate several serious animal diseases within a few years. B. Improve feeding management: The large number of livestock deaths in pastoral areas is mainly due to poor feeding management. The most common causes are death from lack of grass, freezing, starvation, and disease in winter and spring, and this gradually leads to the degradation of livestock breeds. Therefore, the current widespread and fundamental method of improving animal husbandry in the Northwest lies in improving feeding management, starting with building sheds, storing winter grass, isolating sick animals, paying attention to livestock health care, reducing deaths, and laying the foundation for improving livestock breeds and increasing reproduction.

    Third, protect the grasslands. The serious problems currently existing in the Northwest grasslands are mainly the lack of drinking water and disputes over grazing rights, followed by the problem of topsoil turnover and indiscriminate reclamation and destruction. The solution is mainly to build canals to divert water, dig wells, and store water to solve the difficulty of lacking drinking water in sandy and arid pastures; organize mediation committees and unity conferences to negotiate the rational use of pastures and implement seasonal zoning and rotational grazing to resolve disputes over grazing rights; implement crop rotation and prohibit indiscriminate reclamation to cultivate and protect grasslands. According to our surveys in Qinghai's former Haitan, Sanjiaocheng, Gansu's Bianwan, Damaying and other grasslands, if the above problems are properly resolved, the carrying capacity can be increased by more than one time. In the future, we should carry out this work in a planned, focused, and steady manner.

    Fourth, combine agriculture and animal husbandry: The development of agriculture and animal husbandry is determined by the natural, transportation, economic and other conditions of various places. Agriculture should be carried out where it is suitable for agriculture, and animal husbandry should be carried out where it is suitable for animal husbandry. They should complement each other and neither should be neglected. In the past, there was a lack of appropriate planning in this regard, so there was indiscriminate reclamation of pastures and the stagnation of nomadic economic development. In the future, in order to rationally use land, maintain and increase land fertility, and increase the income of herdsmen and farmers, the development of agriculture and animal husbandry must have reasonable planning and specific organizational leadership to promote its realization. Under conditions where climate, rainfall, soil, and irrigation are suitable, nomadism can gradually move towards sedentary animal husbandry, and the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry can be promoted to implement pasture land rotation. This can not only improve the lives of farmers and herdsmen - increasing the staple food of herdsmen and the meat food of farmers - but also improve livestock feeding, so that sick livestock, breeding livestock, and female livestock can get better feed and reduce mortality. Otherwise, like many nomadic areas today, with "winter camps" in winter and "summer camps" in summer, migrating everywhere, and living in unsettled places, not only is it impossible to improve feeding management, but even political power is not easy to establish, and medical, educational, and health work are difficult to promote. Therefore, gradually moving from nomadism to sedentary animal husbandry has become a direction for improving the economic development of fraternal nationalities. In the past two or thirty years, many herdsmen in Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan in Xinjiang have engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry, and were the first to accept and widely use Soviet-style horse-drawn agricultural implements, with an average grain yield of 120 catties per mu, with very good results.

    Fifth, cultivate ethnic cadres and improve culture: The lack of ethnic cadres and the lack of communication in language and writing have become a major obstacle to our work in fraternal nationality areas. To this end, we must cultivate, use, and promote a large number of ethnic cadres - administrative cadres and technical cadres. At the same time, we must popularize cultural and educational undertakings and translate various important policies and documents, as well as popular technical knowledge booklets, into various languages as soon as possible to facilitate publicity and promotion. In addition, diseases, especially venereal diseases, are very prevalent in animal husbandry areas, which have a great impact on national health and production. Therefore, medical and health undertakings urgently need to be vigorously promoted, which is very popular among fraternal nationalities.

　　把西北兄弟民族的农业经济提高一步
    西北畜牧部副部长  张中
    西北是一个多民族地区，兄弟民族人口达七百余万，占全区总人口四分之一强。仅新疆一省就有回、蒙、满、维吾尔、塔塔尔、塔基克、哈萨克、乌兹别克、喀尔克兹、锡伯、索伦、俄罗斯及汉族等十三个民族。他们有着不同的语言、文字、生活、风俗、宗教信仰和习惯。和内地农业区域不同的主要经济特征，是大部分兄弟民族以畜牧或农牧兼营为主，其中新疆的蒙族、哈族、塔基克族、喀尔克兹族，青海、甘肃和宁夏的蒙族、藏族同胞绝大部分还过着游牧生活。“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊。”这美丽的画面，就是我们无数可爱的兄弟民族世世代代用勤劳的双手绘成的。但在长期封建反动统治下，尤其数十年来惨遭马匪残酷剥削疯狂掠夺的结果，他们的生活是十分穷苦的。由于草原破坏，疫病流行，牲畜死亡率很大，再加之皮毛找不到销路，故牲畜数量锐减，十年来青海牲畜数量已减少百分之四十，宁夏的马减少百分之七十，牛和骆驼减少百分之五十，羊减少百分之三十，新疆牲畜减少百分之二十四。羊毛几乎成了废物。因而牧民生活每况愈下，僻居在青海巴颜喀刺山的果洛族甚至过着吃角麻（人种野草），饮牛血的生活。
    解放以来，由于我们正确执行了民族政策，贸易政策，与畜牧农业各项工作设施的结果，这些兄弟民族的经济生活才开始好转。
    根据共同纲领与一年来工作的经验，要做好这一工作，主要有以下几方面：
    第一、畅开畜产品销路，活跃物资交流。羊毛贵，人才喜欢养羊，这是尽人皆知的道理，历来的事实也完全证明了这一点。解放一年来，牧民最感痛快的就是羊毛涨了价，以新疆为例，羊毛已由每斤六百元（新币）提高到一千四百元，过去一封茶换四只羊，现在只能换一只羊，过去一斤夏毛换一斤面粉，现在已可换四斤面粉。其它像羊肠、羊皮价格都提高五倍左右，青海等地情况也是同样。据西北贸易部统计，一年来新疆全省在国营贸易领导下，收购土产有羊四十五万只，牛二万六千头，羊、牛、马、兽皮共六十九万张，羊毛、驼毛及山羊绒共三千五百二十吨，小麦六千五百吨，棉花五万公斤，总共可给新疆农牧民增加收入约值新疆币三亿五千万元，合人民币一百三十五亿元。换回的是大批生活资料和生产资料，仅由内地就运去布匹五十七万余匹，茶叶四十九万封，并由苏联输入布匹四十三万米，拖拉机、耕犁一千三百九十七架。及其它许多器材物资等。牧民们异口同声说：“毛主席是我们的大活佛！”他们把毛主席的照片买回去，供奉在神龛里。这反映了用合理价格收购畜产土产，与供应牧区所需要的布匹、粮食、茶叶、礼帽及其它日用品，为团结兄弟民族的成功政策。今后还需要继续加强以国营贸易机构为领导的贸易工作，组织合作社、私商，采取灵活的方式，如流动贸易小组等，克服交通困难，深入牧区进行贸易工作，贯彻合理价格政策，并尽力做到产品检验，分级差价，奖励牧民提高畜产品质，取缔搀杂搀假，以便利外销。
    第二、注意牲畜防疫保健。这里包括两方面的工作：甲、防疫：去年本区以畜牧区为重点预防注射牛瘟、炭疽、出血性败血症、牛气肿胀及治疗检查各种家畜疫病等共一百九十二万头，制造各种疫苗一百四十余万西西，各种血清二百二十八万西西，这是国民党反动统治二十多年所没有做了的事，而我们胜利地完成了。今年将继续贯彻以防疫为主，治疗为辅的方针，计划加强兽疫防治站及工作队的群众工作，并结合牲畜保险，开展广泛的防疫运动，争取在几年以内把几种严重的兽疫基本上加以扑灭。乙、改善饲养管理：牧区牲畜大量的死亡，主要是饲养管理不善，冬春缺草，冻饿罹病致死的最多，且因此逐渐形成畜种退化。所以，目前改进西北畜牧事业大量普遍而治本的办法，还在于改善饲养管理，从搭建棚圈，贮备冬草，幼病隔离等方面着手，注意牲畜保健，减少死亡，并打下改良畜种，增加繁殖的基础。
    第三、保护草原。目前西北草原存在的严重问题主要是缺乏饮水与牧权纠纷，其次为表土翻新和滥垦破坏问题。解决的途径主要是修渠引水，打井，蓄水，解决砂旱草场缺乏饮水的困难；组织调解委员会，团结会，协商合理使用牧场，实行季节分区轮牧，解决牧权纠纷；实行轮耕与禁止滥垦，以培植保护草原。据我们在青海原海滩、三角城、甘肃边湾、大马营等草原调查估计，若上述问题适当解决后，载畜量可以增加一倍以上。今后我们当有计划、有重点地稳步进行这一工作。
    第四、农牧结合：农业与畜牧业的发展，是根据各地自然、交通、经济种种条件而定的，宜农则农，宜牧则牧，相辅而行，不可偏废。以前在这方面缺乏适当的计划，所以存在滥垦牧地，与游牧经济发展停滞的现象。今后为了土地的合理利用，保持与增加土地肥力，增加牧民及农民收入，农牧业的发展须要有合理的规划，与具体的组织领导促其实现。在气候、雨量、土壤、灌溉适宜的条件下，可使游牧逐渐走向定牧，提倡农牧业兼营，实行牧草田轮作，这样既可以改善农牧民生活——使牧民增加面食，农民增加肉食，而且可以改善牲畜饲养，使病畜、种畜、母畜得到更好的饲料，减少死亡。否则像今天许多游牧区一样，冬有“冬窝子”，夏有“夏窝子”，到处迁徙，居住无定，不但改善饲养管理成为不可能，甚至连政权也不易建立起来，医药、文教、卫生工作都难以推行。所以，由游牧逐渐走向定牧已成为提高兄弟民族经济发展的一个方向。近二三十年来，新疆伊犁、塔城、阿山牧民兼营农业的已很不少，并最先接受与普遍使用了苏联新式马拉农具，粮食每亩平均产量一二○斤，成绩很好。
    第五、培养民族干部、提高文化：民族干部少，语言文字不通，已成为我们开展兄弟民族地区工作的一大障碍。为此，我们必须大批培养、使用、提拔民族干部——行政干部和技术干部。同时要普及文化教育事业，尽快地把各种重要的政策及文件，与通俗的技术常识小册子翻译成各种文字，便于宣传推广。此外，畜牧区域疾病尤其性病很流行，对民族健康和生产影响很大，因此，医药卫生事业亟须大力推行，这是很受兄弟民族欢迎的。
