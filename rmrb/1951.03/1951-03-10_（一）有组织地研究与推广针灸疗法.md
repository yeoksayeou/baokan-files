　　(I) Organized Research and Promotion of Acupuncture Therapy
　　Acupuncture therapy has a long history and rich experience in our country. However, because many people in our medical community did not pay enough attention to it in the past, it could not be well developed. Today, in liberated China, all our excellent cultural and scientific heritage should be fully developed. The broad masses of people urgently need acupuncture therapy, and our medical community has the responsibility to rapidly popularize it among the masses and to conduct planned and organized research on acupuncture therapy, so that its rich experience can be quickly elevated to the height of scientific theory. This will surely have a tremendous effect on the health care work of the broad masses of people.
　　Scientific research and promotion of acupuncture therapy require close cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine everywhere. The acupuncture therapy forum convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government made a good start in this regard. We hope that in the future, Chinese and Western medicine in our country can further adopt various specific methods to cooperate in this work and jointly strive to develop the new Chinese medicine.

　　（一）有组织地研究与推广针灸疗法
    针灸疗法在我国有悠久的历史，有丰富的经验。但是因为我国医学界中许多人过去未加以重视，使它不能很好地发展。今天，在解放了的中国，我们一切优秀的文化与科学遗产都应该得到充分的发展。广大的人民群众正迫切需要针灸疗法，我们的医学界就有责任把它迅速普及到人民大众中去，并有责任有计划有组织地对针灸疗法进行研究，使它的丰富经验迅速提高到科学理论的高度。这对于广大人民的保健工作，一定会发生巨大的作用。
    针灸疗法的科学研究与推广，处处都需要中西医的密切合作。中央人民政府卫生部所召开的针灸疗法座谈会，在这一方面做了良好的开端。我们希望今后我国中西医在这个工作中能够更进一步采取各种具体办法实行合作，共同为发展新中国的医学而努力。
