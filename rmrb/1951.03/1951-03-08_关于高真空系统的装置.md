　　On the Device of High Vacuum System
　　Assistant Teacher of the Physics Department of Jiaotong University Fang Junxin

　　　　The Meaning and Value of Vacuum
　　We human beings live on the Earth, which is enveloped by an extremely thick atmosphere. This atmosphere is of paramount importance in ensuring the safe life of human beings. The pressure this atmosphere exerts on the human body is equivalent to the pressure of a mercury column about 760 mm high. Therefore, the height of 760 mm of mercury at 0 degrees Celsius is usually used to represent a standard atmospheric pressure. We know that under normal atmospheric pressure, gas is a fairly good insulator. However, if the number of gas molecules in a closed space (such as a closed glass tube with two metal poles attached) is reduced by a vacuum pump, that is, the gas pressure is reduced, the conductivity of the gas in this closed space will increase, and when a certain degree is reached, there will be a discharge phenomenon. This vacuum discharge phenomenon changes its appearance with pressure. This provides extremely valuable research data in science, promotes the development of science, and the development of modern physics originates from the research of this type of phenomenon. In practical terms, the effectiveness of some vacuum tubes makes use of this phenomenon. Other examples, such as neon lights used in the market and fluorescent lights used in rooms, all use the conductivity of gas in a vacuum.
　　The pressure of gas in a vacuum is usually expressed in millimeters of mercury. The above-mentioned conductivity phenomenon occurs in the vacuum range with a pressure between one and one-thousandth of a millimeter (mercury height omitted). If the pressure continues to decrease, entering one ten-thousandth of a millimeter, the gas's conductivity will be greatly reduced again. This is the insulation effect of gas in a high vacuum, which is extremely important in science and in practice.
　　On the other hand, electrons are an extremely outstanding expert in science and engineering, and we need to use them everywhere to serve humanity. However, how to give electrons sufficient energy, so that they can move forward at high speed, and without losing their kinetic energy due to collision with gas molecules during the journey, is another issue that modern science must focus on. Therefore, in a glass tube (with metal as electrodes), by reducing the pressure of the gas inside to around one-thousandth of a millimeter, we have all the conditions we need:
　　1. The insulation of the gas in a high vacuum (a good glass tube has sufficient insulation ability) ensures that we can apply a high voltage to the metal pole. The electron, under the action of such a high voltage, can become powerful, thus giving electricity sufficient energy.
　　2. At this time, the extreme scarcity of gas molecules in the glass tube makes it rare for electrons to collide with gas molecules on their journey, which also ensures that the original energy of the electrons is not lost.
　　3. It can also greatly reduce the impact of positive gas ions on the cathode filament, further guaranteeing the life of the cathode filament.
　　Therefore, in X-ray tubes and high-power emission tubes, where these are places where powerful electrons are needed to serve, a very high standard of vacuum is very necessary. Therefore, high vacuum technology occupies an important position in scientific research, engineering manufacturing, and our living needs.

　　　　Problems in High Vacuum Technology
　　The high vacuum we are talking about, in the scientific sense, means that the gas pressure is less than one dyne per square centimeter (that is, 0.000750 mm of mercury). In reality, it is absolutely impossible for us to obtain an absolute vacuum because: First, the effectiveness of the vacuum pump decreases as the air pressure in the evacuated part decreases, and finally reaches the lowest pressure limit of the vacuum pump, and it no longer has the ability to exhaust air. Second, because any substance, whether metal or glass, has its vapor. In a high vacuum, this vapor becomes apparent. Therefore, to properly use a high vacuum to serve us, we must measure the degree of high vacuum.
　　Although there are many measurement methods, each has its shortcomings. Mercury is commonly used as a medium for measurement, but the error is very large when the pressure is lower than one hundred thousandth of a millimeter, especially when mercury vapor is involved in the vacuum system, forcing us to use liquid air to remove it. Therefore, in high vacuum, we often use the characteristics of gas to manufacture various vacuum pressure gauges to accurately measure the vacuum degree of less than one hundred thousandth of a millimeter.
　　Secondly, in the process of installing a vacuum system, (1) we must be very careful to keep it clean. If even a trace of organic matter falls into the system, this trace amount of organic matter will continuously release gas, making it impossible for us to obtain a high degree of vacuum at all. (2) When metals and glass are in the atmosphere, they absorb a large amount of gas. When they reach a high vacuum, these gases will continuously escape, thus damaging the vacuum degree in the system. (3) The vapor pressure of various materials used in the system must be considered in advance. Those with slightly higher vapor pressure at normal temperature cannot be used. (4) All possibilities of gas leakage in the system itself and its attachments must be eliminated. (5) Metal rust is absolutely impossible to exist in the system. (6) The entry of water vapor into the system must be effectively avoided.

　　　　The Motive and Process of the Device
　　Once, Mayor Chen Yi of Shanghai made a situation report to workers in higher education, pointing out the conspiracies of imperialism and the significance of our anti-blockade. I was extremely moved after listening, so I thought about how a scientific and technological educator should cooperate with the policy to carry out work. After several months of deliberation, and because the closed X-ray tube used in the physics laboratory failed, all experiments related to X-rays could not be carried out. Moreover, the demand for high vacuum equipment in Shanghai and its surrounding areas is increasing day by day. Therefore, with the encouragement of Professor Zhou Tongqing, I started to delve into vacuum technology in April last year, aiming to install a set of high vacuum system to meet the vacuum required for the above requirements. However, because the vacuum pump used was not able to be used for more than ten years due to the school being relocated and forced to evacuate during the reactionary rule period, as well as the oppression of the reactionary rule. Therefore, it was already rusted, the parts were scattered and incomplete, the oil used was also exhausted, and especially the metal joints had deformed and could not be tightly sealed, and the air leakage was extremely serious. However, with the help of various parties inside and outside the school, the above difficulties were gradually overcome. For example, colleagues in this department assisted in distilling pure mercury and machining metal parts, colleagues in the electrical engineering department assisted in calibrating part of the electronic circuits, colleagues in the mechanical engineering department assisted in machining metal joints with very high standards, and colleagues in the chemical and chemical engineering department assisted in making vacuum oils, especially the Academy of Sciences outside the school gave valuable high vacuum oils, etc. Without their assistance, the work would not be possible. These assistances were only possible today after liberation. During the installation process, thanks to the encouragement of the trade union, the support of the administration, and the leadership of Mr. Zhou Tongqing and the help of colleagues in the department, I often worked in an encouraging mood, and I did not feel tired even when working for more than ten hours a day.
　　After eight months of research and exploration, a high standard of vacuum degree (five ten-millionths of a millimeter of mercury) was finally accurately obtained, entering a range with a lot of practical value. Experiments on X-rays have also been restored on a new and independent basis. In order to further develop the work, the East China Ministry of Education gave timely assistance in manpower and funding. In this new and exciting environment, more than a dozen colleagues from our physics department and electrical engineering department have organized a working committee and are now proceeding to prepare an auxiliary equipment, so that this technology can be specifically applied to the repair and research of X-ray tubes and high vacuum electron tubes and other special tubes, to meet the needs of the people's motherland.
　　Everything must be thanked to Chairman Mao. Without his wise leadership, we would never have such a good working environment and working conditions.

　　关于高真空系统的装置
    交大物理系助教  方俊鑫
            真空的意义和价值
    我们人类所生活的地球上，笼罩有一层极厚的气层，这气层对于保障人类安全的生活，有着非常重要的意义。这气层所加于人体的压力约相当于７６０毫米水银柱高的压力。所以寻常就以摄氏零度时７６０毫米的汞高来表示一个标准大气压。我们知道在寻常大气压下，气体是个相当良好的绝缘体。但是如果在一封闭的空间（譬如一封闭的玻璃管并附有两个金属极）用抽气机把气体分子的数量减少，即气体压力降低，这封闭空间中的气体、导电能力就增加，达到某一程度时，更有放电的现象产生。这种真空放电的现象随着压力而改变它的外貌。这在科学上提供了极有价值的研究资料，推进了科学的发展，近代化物理学的发展就是导源于这类现象的研究。在实用上有些真空管的效用就利用这种现象，其他如市场上所用的霓虹灯及房间里所用的日光灯，都是利用气体在真空中的导电现象。
    真空中气体的压力我们通常以毫米汞高来表示。上述的导电现象在发生压力介于一至千分之一毫米（汞高从略）的真空范围。如若将压力继续降低，进入万分之一毫米，气体的导电能力则又大大减小。这是高真空中气体的绝缘效用，这效用在科学上和实用上又是极其重要的。
    另一方面，电子是科学上、工程上一名极其卓越的能手，我们到处都要利用它来为人类服务。但是如何给予电子充分的能量，使它以飞快的速度前进，并且在前进途程中，更不致因撞击了气体的分子而损失其动能，这又是现代科学上所要着重考虑的问题，所以在一具玻璃管内（以金属为电极），把其中气体的压力降至千分之一毫米附近，我们所需的条件就都具备：
    一、高真空中气体的绝缘性（好的玻璃管具有足够的绝缘能力），保证了我们能够在金属极加上高电压，电子受到这样高电压的作用就可以变得强有力，这就给予电力充分的能量。
    二、此时玻璃管内气体分子的极端稀少，使电子在前进的途程上很少与气体分子撞击，又保证了电子原有能量不致损失。
    三、更可大大免除气体正游子对阴极金属丝的撞击，进一步保证了阴极丝的寿命。
    所以在Ｘ光管和强力放射管中，这些都是需要强有力的电子来服务的地方，标准很高的真空度就非常必要。因此，高真空的技术，在科学研究上，在工程制造上，在我们生活需要上，是占据着重要的地位的。
            高真空技术上的问题
    我们所说的高真空，在科学上的意义是表示气体压力小于每平方厘米一达因（即○·○○○七五○毫米汞高）。实际上我们绝不可能得到绝对的真空，原因是：一则抽气机的效能，因被抽空部分的气压减小而降低，最后达到该抽气机的最低压力限度，就不再有排气的本领。二则因为任何一种物质，无论金属或玻璃，都有其蒸气，在高真空中，这蒸气就显出来。所以要适当地利用高度真空来为我们服务，就必须测量高真空的程度。
    测量的方法虽然很多，但各有其缺点。普通常用水银作媒剂来测定，但是在压力低于十万分之一毫米时，差误很大，尤其水银蒸气卷入真空系统，迫使我们要用液体空气来驱除之。所以在高真空中，我们又往往利用气体的特性来制造各种真空压力计，以准确地测定压力小于十万分之一毫米的真空度。
    其次，在装置真空系统的过程中，（一）我们要十分谨慎地保持清洁，如果有丝毫的有机物掉入系统中，则这点微量的有机物，将不断放出气体来，使我们根本不可能获得高度的真空。（二）金属及玻璃在大气中时，吸着了多量气体，一到高真空中，这些气体就不断逸放出来，因此会损坏了系统中的真空度。（三）系统中所用的各种物料必须事先考虑其蒸气压，凡是在常温中蒸气压稍高的，都不能使用。（四）系统本身及附着物中的一切漏进气体的可能性，都必需免除。（五）金属的锈是绝对不可能在系统中存在的。（六）系统中必须有效地免除水蒸气的卷入。
            装置的动机和经过
    有一次上海市陈毅市长对高教工作者作形势报告，指出了帝国主义的阴谋，和我们反封锁的意义。我听了极为感动，因此想到作为一个科技教育工作者应如何配合政策来进行工作呢？经过了几个月的酝酿，同时由于物理实验室中所用的封闭Ｘ光管失效，所有关于Ｘ射线的实验，无法进行。更由于上海及其附近地区，对于高真空设备的需求日增。所以在周同庆教授的鼓励下，于去年四月间着手于真空技术的钻研，目的在装置一套高度真空系统，以适应上述要求所需的真空。但因所用的抽气机在过去反动统治时期，学校被迁移和强迫疏散，以及反动统治的压迫，教育事业在窒息中，十数年来，无法动用。因此已经生锈，零件散失不全，所用的油亦告干竭，尤其在金属的接头上产生了变形，不能密合，漏气情形极为严重。但由于校内校外多方面的协助，终于逐步地克服了以上的困难，例如本系同人协助蒸馏纯净的水银及车制金属零件，电机系同人协助校准一部分电子电路，机械系同人代为车制标准很高的金属接头，化学化工系同人代制真空油类，尤其校外科学院的赠给可贵的高真空油类等，没有他们的协助，工作是无法进行的。这些协助也只有在解放后的今天才有了可能。在装置过程中，更由于工会的鼓励，行政的支持，以及周同庆先生的领导、同系同人的帮助，使我经常工作在鼓舞的情绪中，虽然每天工作达十数小时亦不感到疲倦。
    这样经过了八个月的钻研和摸索，终于准确获得了标准颇高的真空度（千万分之五毫米汞高），进入了颇多实用价值的范围。关于Ｘ射线的实验也在新的独立的基础上恢复起来。为了进一步开展工作，华东教育部更适时地给予人力上和经费上的补助。就是在这样新的而使人兴奋的环境中，我们物理系和电机系十数位同人更组织了工作委员会，现正进行配制一具辅助设备，以便把这一技术具体地应用到Ｘ光管和高真空电子管以及其他特种管的修理和研制的工作上去，以配合人民祖国的需要。
    一切都要感谢毛主席，没有他的英明领导，我们是绝不会有这样好的工作环境和工作条件的。
