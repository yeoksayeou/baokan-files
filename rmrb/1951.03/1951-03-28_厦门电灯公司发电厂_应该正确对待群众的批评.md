　　Xiamen Electric Light Company Power Plant
    Should Correctly Treat the Criticism of the Masses

Editor:

    In the "Reader's Letters" column of your newspaper on February 12th, you published the letter I wrote about why the Xiamen Electric Light Company Power Plant couldn't start a production competition. Many comrades here have read the clipping of this letter that you sent. Now I will tell you about some of the reactions to this article and talk about some comrades' views on conducting criticism and self-criticism in newspapers.

    When some of the leading comrades of our company first saw the clipping you sent, they didn't pay much attention to the newspaper's criticism. Director Chen of the power plant was somewhat indifferent to this. The union cadres also did not propose to check or improve the leadership's production work. Only the company's deputy special commissioner (sent to the company by the Municipal Construction Bureau) believed that this criticism was correct. He also asked me to draft a production incentive method to launch a production competition.

    By early March, your newspaper sent a letter urging the leading cadres of our factory to reply to this matter. This made a big difference. In order to study how to reply, Special Commissioner (Head) immediately asked Director Chen of the power plant to talk. The union chairman asked the comrades in the union's cultural and educational department to examine themselves. At this time, some comrades in the union's cultural and educational group were very dissatisfied, saying that if I had opinions on the work, I should have raised them internally and should not have written to the newspaper. Some comrades complained that they shouldn't have criticized like this, saying, "We worked hard and suffered a lot, and now it's all in vain." Director Chen of the power plant also came to me and said, "After liberation, our work has had many achievements, and everyone has worked hard and been very friendly. Now, with your criticism, it's all over, and we've lost face for the entire company." Director Chen was unhappy with the criticism and pursued individual inappropriate words in my draft. After I explained it to him, he finally admitted that many of the facts I listed were correct, but he still felt that these issues should be raised internally and not criticized in the newspaper. He also said, "The power plant has many shortcomings, all because I didn't lead well, I can only resign." These incorrect statements and abnormal emotions show that many comrades do not see the criticism in the newspaper as a way to improve work; instead, they see it as a personal attack, as a matter of "losing face." They believe that being criticized will "damage their reputation." Therefore, they only allow praise in the newspaper and do not allow criticism. They do not adopt a welcoming and protective attitude towards critics, but rather obstruct them, blame them, and put pressure on them. These things have sometimes made me timid and afraid of difficulties, and I dare not uphold the truth.

    As early as last July, due to the encouragement of comrades from the Xiamen Daily, I wrote an article reporting on the situation of our factory's material inventory, in which I criticized the company's leadership for not paying enough attention to this work. When I sent the draft to the military liaison officer (sent to the company by the Municipal Construction Bureau) for review, he made many explanations of the criticisms that I thought were inconsistent with the actual situation, and he also raised some statistical figures that were unscientific. In the end, he also said, "These opinions should be raised internally first, and only if they are not adopted can they be criticized in the newspaper." At that time, I deleted these paragraphs; he then questioned me about the reasons for deleting them, repeatedly making things difficult for me and refusing to stamp his approval. After I sent the draft to the Xiamen Daily and explained this situation, the newspaper comrades believed that those criticisms were necessary and published it as it was originally written. After the draft was published, the special commissioner (sent to the company by the Municipal Construction Bureau) criticized me, saying that the draft should not have been published without him seeing it. The factory's administrative and union leaders also felt that the criticism was "somewhat excessive" and "unnecessary." They took the criticism itself so seriously, but they did not pay attention to the shortcomings in the work that were criticized, and after the criticism, that was the end of it.

    After that, for a long time, I didn't dare to write critical reports. In the Xiamen Daily, the reports about our factory were mostly about achievements and advantages, and rarely criticized the shortcomings in our work. This also objectively fostered a sense of complacency among some leading comrades, making them unable to treat criticism with humility.

    I think the attitude of the above comrades towards criticism is wrong. It should be corrected ideologically. Otherwise, it will seriously hinder the development of criticism and self-criticism and hinder the progress of work.

    In addition, I must explain that the Xiamen Electric Light Company has made considerable achievements in safe operation, saving fuel, and reducing costs in the year or so since liberation. I have also reported on this extensively in the Xiamen Daily. The company's status and achievements are highly valued by the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. In my previous letter to you, I did not adequately explain the company's achievements; at the same time, I did not further analyze the reasons why the competition could not be started. This is something that I should examine myself and pay attention to correcting in future writing.

Editor's Note: According to the letter from reader Liao Xianlie, the attitude of some administrative and union leading cadres of the Xiamen Electric Light Company Power Plant towards mass criticism is wrong. They should not be afraid and refuse, but should warmly welcome the masses' criticism of their work in the newspaper, and humbly and realistically accept the correct parts of the criticism, seriously improve their work, and explain and clarify the incorrect parts of the criticism. This will improve their work, inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, and win the support and love of the masses. We hope that the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will help the company's cadres, in light of the company's actual situation, seriously study the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" promulgated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, correct their erroneous understanding of this issue, and tell us the results.

### 厦门电灯公司发电厂  应该正确对待群众的批评

专栏：工厂来信

　　厦门电灯公司发电厂
    应该正确对待群众的批评编辑同志：
    贵报二月十二日读者来信栏，发表了我写的关于厦门电灯公司发电厂为什么搞不起生产竞赛的信。你们寄来刊登这信的剪报，我们这里很多同志都看过了。现在告诉你们一些对此稿的反应，并谈谈某些同志对在报纸上进行批评和自我批评的看法。
    当我们公司的某些领导同志最初看到你们寄来的剪报时，对报纸的批评，多半还不怎么注意。发电厂陈主任对此有些无所谓。工会的干部也未提出检查或改进领导生产的工作。只有公司副特派员（市建设局派驻公司的），认为这一批评是对的。他并要我拟订一个生产奖励的办法，以便发动生产竞赛。
    至三月初，贵报来信催促我厂领导干部对此事进行答复。这一来就大为不同了。为了研究如何答复，特派员（正）马上找发电厂陈主任去谈话。工会主席叫工会文教部门的同志检讨。这时，工会文教组有的同志就很不满意，说我对工作有意见应该在内部提，不该写去登报。有的同志埋怨不该这么批评，说：“我们干工作受忙受累，这一下都落空了。”发电厂陈主任也来向我说：“解放后，我们的工作有很多成绩，大家好好干多亲热。现在你这样批评一下都完了，我们整个公司的风头都失掉了。”陈主任对批评不高兴，就向我追究稿子中个别不适当的字句，经我向他解释说明，最后他也承认我列举的很多事实是对的，但他仍觉得，对这些问题应该在内部提意见，不可拿到报纸上批评。他并说：“发电厂有很多缺点，都是我领导得不好，我只有辞职不干了。”这些不正确的说法，和不正常的情绪，说明不少同志不是把报纸上的批评看成是为了改进工作；而是把它看成对个人的打击，看成“丢面子”的事。认为自己受了批评就会“名誉扫地”。所以，就只许在报纸上表扬，不许批评。对批评者不是采取欢迎和保护的态度，而是阻挠，责难，对其形成压力。这些，有时曾使我胆怯畏难，不敢坚持真理。
    早在去年七月，由于厦门日报的同志的鼓励，我曾写稿报道我厂清理物资的情形，其中曾批评公司领导同志对这一工作不够重视。当我把稿件送给市建设局派驻公司的军事联络员审查时，他对批评的地方作了很多在我看来是不符合实际情况的解释，又提出某些统计数字不科学。最后，也是说：“这些意见应先在内部提出，如不被采纳，才可以在报纸上批评。”我当时把这几段删掉了；他又追问我删去的理由，一再为难，不予盖章通过。当我把稿件送给厦门日报并说明这一情况后，报社同志认为那些批评是必要的，又照原来所写的发表了。稿件发表后，市建设局派驻公司的特派员即批评我，稿件不应该不经过他看。厂内行政和工会领导同志也认为批评“有些过火”，“不必要”。他们对批评本身这样认真，但对所批评的工作缺点，却不加过问，批评以后也就完了。
    以后，很长时间，我都不大敢写批评报道。在厦门日报上，对我厂的报道也多是成绩和优点方面，很少批评过工作中的缺点。这在客观上也助长了某些领导同志的自满情绪，不能虚心地对待批评。
    我觉得上述一些同志对待批评的态度是错误的。应该从思想上加以纠正。不然，会严重地阻碍批评和自我批评的开展，阻碍工作的进步。
    另外，我必须加以说明的是：厦门电灯公司解放后一年多来，在安全运转、节省燃料、降低成本等方面，都有相当成绩。对此，我也曾在厦门日报上，作过不少报道。该公司的地位和成绩，本市人民政府和市总工会都是很重视的。我在上次写给你们的信稿上，未把公司的成绩加以适当说明；同时，对搞不起竞赛的原因，也未进一步分析清楚。这是我自己应该检讨并在今后写稿中注意改正的。
                  福建厦门电灯公司发电厂  廖显烈
    编者按：根据读者廖显烈的来信来看，厦门电灯公司发电厂某些行政和工会领导干部，对待群众批评的态度是错误的。他们不应该害怕和拒绝而是应该热烈欢迎群众对自己的工作在报纸上所作的批评，并且虚心地、实事求是地对批评的正确部分加以接受，在工作中认真改进，对批评中不正确的地方加以解释和说明。这样就会改进自己的工作，启发群众的积极性，获得群众拥护与爱戴。我们希望中共厦门市委帮助该公司的干部，结合公司实际情形，认真学习中国共产党中央委员会所公布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，纠正他们对这一问题的错误认识，并将结果告诉我们。
