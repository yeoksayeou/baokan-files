　　Anti-Japanese War Picture Strips and Anti-Animation Films Should Not Be Confused
　　To the Editor:
　　Yesterday (March 13th), your newspaper's "Reader's Letters" column published the Shanghai Yuhua Tobacco Company's reply regarding the anti-animation film included in Hongshi brand cigarettes. After reading it, I felt that it was inappropriate to confuse anti-Japanese War picture strips with anti-animation films. This could easily mislead readers into thinking that anti-Japanese War picture strips are reactionary. In reality, reader Chen Jingyi's criticism (see this newspaper, February 22nd) was only that one of the "Eight-Year Victory History of the Anti-Japanese War" picture strips he saw in a pack of Hongshi cigarettes depicted images of the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek and his accomplices. He advocated that this be banned. However, he did not say sweepingly that all anti-Japanese War picture strips are reactionary. You published Yuhua Company's letter without investigation, which was really inappropriate. I hope you will clarify this.

### 抗战画片与反动画片不能混为一谈

专栏：读者来信

    抗战画片与反动画片不能混为一谈编辑同志：
    昨天（三月十三日）贵报《读者来信》栏内，载有上海裕华烟草公司对红士牌香烟内附有反动画片的答复。我读后，觉得其中把抗战画片与反动画片混为一谈，甚不妥当，这样很容易使读者误会成抗战画片即是反动的画片。实际上，读者陈静义所提出的批评（见二月二十二日本报），只是他在一包红士牌香烟里所看到的一张“抗战八年胜利画史”，上面画着人民公敌蒋介石及其帮凶的像。他主张对此加以取缔。但并不是笼统地说，一切抗战画片都是反动的。你们对裕华公司来信，不加研究，即行发表，实不应当。希予说明为要。
