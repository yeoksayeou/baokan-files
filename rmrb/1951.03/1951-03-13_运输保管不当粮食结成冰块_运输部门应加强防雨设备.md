　　Improper Transportation and Storage Causes Grain to Freeze into Ice
    Transportation Department Should Strengthen Rain Protection Equipment

    Editor:
    On February 22nd, the Guang'anmen Warehouse under the Beijing Grain Company received a batch of sorghum transported from Caijiagou, Jilin Province, Northeast China. Among them, nine cars of grain were soaked by snow during transportation due to improper storage, and then froze due to the cold, resulting in more than a thousand pounds of grain being frozen into ice. On the same day, three cars of sorghum transported from Songzhan, Heilongjiang Province, were also received, and more than a thousand pounds of frozen grain blocks were unloaded. The climate is gradually warming, not only is it easy for snow to melt, but also there is more rain, so I suggest that the Ministry of Railways' transportation department should pay attention to storage during transportation as early as possible to avoid being soaked by snow or rain, causing damage to the goods. For open wagons, the goods should be piled into a roof shape, covered with grass bags or sacks, and then covered with four layers of reed mats to avoid moisture from spring rain.

    Editor's Note: We hope to receive letters like those from Comrade Liu Wankui, who cares about the cause of the country. This spirit of cherishing public property shows that the people of our new China, under the leadership of the People's Government, have actively participated in the national management and construction cause. We hope that the Ministry of Railways will consider and respond to this reasonable suggestion.

　　运输保管不当粮食结成冰块
    运输部门应加强防雨设备编辑同志：
    北京市粮食公司所属广安门仓库，在二月二十二日收到由东北吉林省蔡家沟运来的红粮一批，其中有九个车的粮食，因在途中保管不善被雪浸潮，再又遇冷，结果使一千多斤粮食结成了冰块。同日又收到由黑龙江省宋站运来红粮三车，也卸出结冰粮块一千多斤。目前气候渐暖，不但落雪易化，而且雨水亦较多，所以我建议铁道部运输部门应及早注意运输中的保管工作，以免浸入雪水或雨水，使货物遭受损失。对无棚的货车应将货物堆成屋脊形，上面用草袋或麻袋盖好，再加盖四层芦苇席，就可以避免春季雨水的浸湿。

    编者按：我们希望经常收到像刘万魁同志这样关心国家事业的来信。这种爱护公共财产的精神，表示了我们新中国的人民在人民政府的领导下，已经积极地参加了国家管理和建设事业。这个合理的建议，希铁道部予以考虑并答复。
