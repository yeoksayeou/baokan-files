Comrade Representatives! The Soviet Peace Committee has instructed me to report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the appeal made by the Second World Peace Congress to the parliaments of all countries regarding issues directly related to the struggle for peace – the banning of war propaganda and the promulgation of the Law on Defending Peace. As is well known, the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw last November was an event of enormous historical significance. It demonstrated the people's unwavering determination to defend peace, and it showed that peace fighters from all countries were in complete agreement on current international issues and their solutions. The Congress made a significant contribution to the closer unity of peace forces against the instigators of another war. The Congress paid particular attention to the issue of combating war propaganda. Recommendation No. 5 in the Congress's letter to the United Nations stated: "We believe that propaganda for a new war poses the greatest threat to the peaceful cooperation of all nations and is one of the most heinous crimes against humanity. We call on the parliaments of all countries in the world to pass laws guaranteeing peace, stipulating that any form of propaganda for a new war should be held criminally liable."

The Congress considered the necessity of formulating such a law to be entirely indisputable. Every civilized country has laws punishing incitement to assassination and advocacy of violence. But why is it that in those countries that boast of their "Western way of life" and call themselves civilized, the clamor for the mass slaughter of men, women, and children fills newspapers and magazines, echoes on the radio, and is shown in cinemas, and yet goes unpunished? In any country, if someone incites the murder of another person, he will be severely punished according to the law; but a warmonger who advocates attacking other countries and calls for the extermination of entire nations has ample opportunity to express and propagate his misanthropic ideas in the press; why is this so?

Hundreds of millions of people in all countries know that the propaganda for a new war, instigated by imperialists, is growing in scale and has now become a serious threat to peace, and all honest, peace-loving people should rise up to fight against war propaganda.

It should be emphasized that the demand made by the Congress to condemn war propaganda is now of particularly great importance. Developments in the past few months have shown that the clamor for launching a new war has become increasingly intense, and actual preparations for war have reached an unprecedented scale.

The rulers of many imperialist countries have announced plans to drastically increase troop strength and arms production. On December 15th last year, the United States declared a national emergency, a measure that is completely unjustified in peacetime. The United States is preparing to form an army of 3.5 million men and a vast air force this year. Reserve ships have been placed on active duty; new ships are being built. The entire American industry, manipulated by monopoly capital, is busy producing military orders worth billions of dollars and is further shifting to serve the preparations for war. In the next two years, the United States government plans to allocate more than 140 billion dollars for war purposes, a shockingly large figure that greatly exceeds the war appropriations of the United States during the most intense period of its war against Hitlerite Germany. The British Labor government has decided to spend 4.7 billion pounds on military expenses in the next three years. France's military budget exceeds one trillion francs. All of this has resulted in cuts in the production of civilian industries, increased tax burdens on the working people, rising prices of necessities, the almost complete cessation of housing construction projects, and substantial reductions in funding for social and cultural undertakings; this is despite the fact that the masses of people in these countries are living in unheard-of poverty and desperately need housing, cheap clothes, shoes, and other necessities.

While continuing the hopeless adventure in Korea, plots to expand aggression in the Far East are also underway, primarily against the Chinese people. The aggressive core of the United Nations, led by the United States, has forced this organization to pass the shameful decision to slander the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor," in order to facilitate their further expansion of aggressive actions.

In violation of all international agreements, the work of rearming West Germany and Japan is being accelerated. Former Hitlerite officers and SS men, who were still war criminals in prison yesterday, have now been released from prison, put on uniforms, and incorporated into the fighting forces that will later become the backbone of the North Atlantic aggressor army. In Japan, recruitment stations have also begun to operate actively, and the remnants of the defeated "Imperial Army" are flocking to American barracks.

In this atmosphere of a frenzied arms expansion movement and fanatical building of armies to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, those who indulge in the basest emotional impulses, those who advocate hatred of humanity, those who poison the international atmosphere by clamoring for mass slaughter of human beings and launching new wars, have run rampant and unbridled.

In the countries of the North Atlantic bloc, newspapers, radio, movies, literature, and art are increasingly subordinated to the interests of preparing for a new war. In the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries, ordinary people hear on the radio and read in newspapers and magazines every day the absurd nonsense that war is inevitable, that it is right to spend large sums of money on armaments, that the "enemy" is knocking on the doors of their countries, and so on.

The reactionary newspapers, movies, and radio stations daily subject peace-loving countries to the most unscrupulous threats and utter cries to eliminate entire nations. Republican Senator Brewster of Maine suggested that atomic bombs should be dropped on China immediately in order to obtain the same beneficial results as when atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese.

After a frenzy of barks from American congressmen, their submissive servants in Western Europe quickly echoed them. In February, the official newspaper of the Dutch Senior Military Officers' Association, "Ons Leger," published an article by a certain Gainhues, who advocated war against the Soviet Union and the use of atomic bombs, germ weapons to poison crops, and so on, in this war. At the instigation of the imperialist rulers, a black tide of cannibalistic cries, hysterical roars, and threatening curses has permeated all aspects of culture, poisoning the literature, radio, and films of capitalist countries.

When American newspapers introduce novels like Maurice's "The Dead Fire" to readers, they are delighted to say that this book tells ordinary Americans an extremely important thing: to prepare for a sudden attack on major American cities by the "enemy" (!). This novel proclaims the necessity of expanding armaments and that ordinary people must prepare to endure the most difficult disasters because such disasters are inevitable.

Movie theaters are showing films about the piratical adventures of American aggressors in Korea. Frightened audiences see piles of corpses, the ruins of smoking towns, and "victors" strutting around nearby. From their demeanor, it seems that the aggressors can do whatever they want and that no force can stop them. The shamelessness of these films is disgusting; at the same time, they are extremely vile in their bragging, especially since the whole world knows that the American "warriors" have repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats in Korea.

Insane senators and ministers, mercenary journalists and counterfeit writers, the owners of huge news monopolies and broadcasting companies are all being used as tools in this vile undertaking of poisoning the people with the ideas of war and murder.

Stalin's recent conversation with a reporter from Pravda has very clearly revealed the goals pursued by war propagandists.

Stalin has pointed out that in the United States, Britain, and France, there are aggressive forces eager for a new war. These people are the wealthy men whose properties are worth millions and billions. They fear their own people, who do not want another war and advocate maintaining peace, so they try to use reactionary governments to ensnare their people in a web of lies, deceive the people, and portray the new war as a defensive war and the peaceful policies of peace-loving countries as aggressive policies. They are trying to deceive their people in order to force them to implement their aggressive plans and drag them into another war.

The reactionary rulers of capitalist countries are trying to make people believe that war is inevitable. But, like every word these rulers say, it is an utter lie.

If the people of all countries take on the cause of defending peace and defend it to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. These remarks by Stalin inspire peace fighters, giving them unwavering confidence in the final victory of the cause of world peace, and therefore, these remarks consolidate the ranks of peace fighters.

All over the world, movements against war, against the militarization of life, against heavy taxes, against the rising cost of living and poverty—all of which are the inevitable products of the arms race—are developing day by day. People are in favor of universal disarmament, demanding a peaceful life, and opposing new military adventures.

More and more masses of people are participating in the movement to defend peace. More and more peace fighters from the working class, peasants, urban middle class, and democratic intellectuals are participating in this movement. People with various religious beliefs and political beliefs are also participating in this movement.

In all countries of the world, including the United States, large-scale protest movements against the Korean War, demanding a peaceful resolution to the Korean War, and stopping aggression against the Far East are constantly taking place. The tide of protests was sparked by the plan to organize the so-called "North Atlantic Army"; the people of Europe unanimously demanded that the commander-in-chief of this army, the American Eisenhower, who came to visit, go back to America! For many months, the heroic dockworkers of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway have been refusing to unload American munitions arriving in Western European ports. Factory workers in France and Italy are refusing to work for the war and are holding strikes to defend their personal rights.

The powerful movement of the European people against the rearmament of West Germany is developing before our eyes. The masses of people in France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and other countries bordering Germany, as well as the people of Germany itself, who have experienced two world wars, are firmly opposing the American plan to restore German militarism. They know that the restoration of German militarism means preparing to launch another war under the direction of American billionaires. They know that the restoration of German militarism is beneficial to the war profiteers and will make it impossible to maintain international peace. Today, whoever wants to maintain peace must fight against the restoration of German militarism and fight against turning the German people into cannon fodder for American war profiteers. The declaration of the Second World Peace Congress calling on the governments of all countries to ban the heinous propaganda of war has been wholeheartedly supported by millions of people around the world.

The Soviet people warmly support this declaration. In the Soviet land, there is no place for new war propaganda. The entire life of the Soviet people is built on principles that are completely different from the lives of people in imperialist countries. The entire way of life of the Soviet people cannot tolerate the idea of ​​promoting massacres and aggression against other countries.

From his childhood, a Soviet citizen lives in a world where he does not hear anyone make remarks about aggression and conquest of the people of other countries, or contempt for people who speak other languages ​​or have different skin colors. The Soviet people do not see books that promote hatred, murder, and crime. He does not see films that depict the adventures of robbers and murderers, nor does he see dramas that summon him to participate in aggressive wars to conquer European and Asian countries.

His life is happy and reasonable. He does his best to serve his people and his motherland. He is wholeheartedly devoted to peaceful creative labor and to the development of culture, science, and art.

The wise Bolshevik Party tirelessly instills in the Soviet people the spirit of deep respect for other nations, the recognition of the equality of all nations, and the spirit of consolidating friendship among them. Soviet writers, educated by the party's noble ideals of socialist humanism, portray the people of Soviet society, the heroes of the Great Patriotic War, and the heroes engaged in great communist construction. Soviet painters reflect the historical events in the life of our motherland and the touching changes in all aspects of our cities and villages. Soviet actors play people with lofty ideals of serving the Soviet motherland in dramas. Soviet films educate the younger generation in the spirit of loyalty to socialist ideals and wholeheartedly serving the motherland. We never need to "firmly resist" novels, film scripts, stage scripts, or paintings, as required by the World Peace Congress' resolution on condemning war propaganda, because in the Soviet Union there are no painters or writers who would instigate war or advocate aggression.

We support the recommendation of the Second World Peace Congress that the parliaments of all countries pass laws to defend peace. We believe that when the turbid tide of war propaganda sweeps across the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries, people will use all possible means to defend world peace. The people of all countries cannot tolerate the aggressive groups in certain countries now openly conducting propaganda for a new war and getting away with it, because the people of all countries have suffered the terrible disasters of two wars in thirty years. The Soviet people consider war propaganda to be the most serious crime against humanity.

Comrade Representatives! Please allow me to present the following draft Law on Defending Peace for the consideration of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

Law on Defending Peace:

"The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, guided by the lofty principles of the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy, and for the purpose of consolidating peace and friendly relations among all countries, believes that the conscience and sense of justice of the people of the whole world, who have suffered the ravages of two world wars in thirty years, cannot tolerate the aggressive groups in certain countries unscrupulously conducting war propaganda, and supports the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress, because this declaration expresses the desire of all progressive humanity to ban and condemn the heinous propaganda of war.

The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics stipulates: (1) All forms of war propaganda shall be regarded as undermining the cause of peace and creating a threat of a new war, and therefore the most serious crime against humanity. (2) Those who commit the crime of propaganda of war shall be handed over to the court and tried as heinous criminals." (Stormy and sustained applause.)

Comrade Representatives! Undoubtedly, the Soviet people will unanimously cheer the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for passing the Law on Defending Peace. (Sustained applause.)

The passage of the Law on Defending Peace by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will be another proof of the Soviet people's commitment to the cause of peace and another proof of our peaceful aspirations.

The passage of this law will be an effective blow to all the vicious war propagandists who live by slandering peace-loving people and to all the hired servants of the misanthropic imperialist aggressors. The passage of the Law on Defending Peace will be another contribution of the Soviet state to the cause of defending peace and defending the best achievements of mankind.

At the same time, the Law on Defending Peace, passed and approved by our highest organ of power – the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – will further consolidate the ranks of peace fighters and will give all peace fighters new strength and consolidate their confidence that the just cause of peace will surely win. (Prolonged applause.) The Soviet people firmly believe that the cause of peace will surely win the final victory – the victory of progressive humanity, because the Soviet people are advancing towards the bright future of communism under the leadership of their great leader, the first standard-bearer of peace, our own Comrade Stalin! (Stormy and sustained applause, finally turning into cheers. Everyone shouts: "Long live Comrade Stalin, Ura!")

　　关于禁止战争宣传与颁布保卫和平法
    ——吉洪诺夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告
    各位代表同志们！苏联拥护和平委员会训令我来向苏联最高苏维埃报告第二届世界和平大会向各国议会所提出的关于与争取和平的斗争有直接关系的问题——关于禁止战争宣传与颁布保卫和平法的问题——的呼吁。如所周知，去年十一月在华沙举行的第二届世界和平大会，是具有巨大的历史重要性的事件。它表现了人民不屈不挠的保卫和平的决心，它表明了各国和平战士们对于当前的国际问题及其解决办法的意见是完全一致的。大会对于更密切的团结和平力量以反对另一次战争的煽动者有着重大的贡献。大会特别注意到反对战争宣传的斗争问题。大会致联合国书的第五项建议说：“我们认为新战争的宣传造成了对各国人民和平合作的最大威胁，是对人类最残忍的罪行之一。我们号召世界各国的议会通过保障和平的法律，规定不论以任何形式进行新战争宣传均应负刑事责任。”
    大会认为制定这种法律的必要是完全无可争论的。每一个文明的国家对于煽动暗杀和鼓吹暴行的行为都有惩罚的法律。但是，在那些吹嘘其“西方生活方式”并自称为文明国的国家里，要求大批屠杀男女老少的叫嚣正充满在报纸和杂志上、回响在无线电中和电影院里，为什么可以不受到惩罚呢？在任何一个国家，如果有人教唆谋杀另一个人，依照法律，他将受到最严厉的惩罚；但是一个鼓吹进攻其他国家并鼓吹消灭整个民族的战争贩子却有充分的机会在新闻事业中表示和宣传他那种憎恶人类的思想；这是为什么呢？
    所有国家的亿万人民都知道：由帝国主义者所煽动的新战争的宣传，其规模越来越大，现在已成为对和平的严重威胁了，所有正直的爱好和平的人民，都应该起来与战争宣传作斗争。
    应该强调指出：大会所提出的谴责战争宣传的要求现在已具有特别巨大的重要性了。过去几个月的发展说明：要求发动新战争的叫嚣已越发强烈，而战争的实际准备也达到了空前的规模。
    许多帝国主义国家的统治者已宣布了大量增加兵力和军火生产的计划。去年十二月十五日，美国宣布全国进入紧急状态，这种措施在和平时期是完全没有道理的。美国正在着手准备于今年组成一支三百五十万人的陆军和庞大的空军。后备役舰只已列入现役的名单中；新的舰只正在建造。被垄断资本所操纵的整个美国工业正在忙于生产价值亿万美元的军事订货，并且进一步地转向为战争的准备服务。在今后两年内，美国政府计划为战争目的指拨一千四百多亿美元，这一骇人听闻的庞大数字，大大超过了美国在与希特勒德国作战最激烈时期的战争拨款。英国工党政府已决定在今后三年内支出军费四十七亿英镑。法国的军事预算超过一万亿法郎。所有这一切都招致了民用工业生产的削减、劳动人民赋税负担的增加、必需品价格的上涨、住房建筑工程的几乎全部停止、社会和文化事业经费的大大削减；尽管这些国家的人民大众过着闻所未闻的贫困生活，迫切需要房屋、廉价的衣服、鞋袜和其他的必需品。
    与在朝鲜继续进行无望的冒险同时，在远东扩大侵略的图谋也在进行之中，首先就是侵略中国人民。以美国为首的联合国的侵略核心已强使这个组织通过了诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的可耻的决定，以便于它们进一步扩大侵略行动。
    违反一切国际协定，重新武装西德和日本的工作正在加速进行中。昨天还是战犯而身系囹圄的前希特勒的军官和党卫军们，今天已经从狱中释放出来，穿上军服，并被编入日后将成为北大西洋侵略军的骨干的战斗部队内。在日本，招兵站也已开始积极行动起来，已被打垮的“皇军”的残兵败将正纷纷投向美国兵营。
    在这种疯狂的扩充军备运动与狂热地建立军队以进攻苏联与人民民主国家的气氛中，那些耽溺于最卑鄙的感情冲动的人们，那些主张憎恨人类的人们、那些以叫嚣大规模屠杀人类与发动新战争来毒化国际空气的人们，已恣意横行无忌了。
    在北大西洋集团的国家中，报纸、广播、电影、文学与艺术越来越从属于准备新战争的利益了。在美国、英国、法国及其他资本主义的国家里，老百姓天天在广播里听到、在书报杂志里读到荒谬的胡说，说什么战争是不可避免的呀，把大量的金钱用于军备是正当的呀，“敌人”正敲着他们国家的大门呀等等。
    反动的报纸、电影与广播每天对爱好和平的国家施以最肆无忌惮的威胁，并大放其要消灭整个民族的叫嚣。缅因州共和党参议员布鲁斯特建议说：应该立即向中国投掷原子弹，以便获得像把原子弹投到日本人头上时所曾收到的一样有利的效果。
    美国议员狂吠一阵后，他们在西欧的百依百顺的奴仆们赶紧遥相呼应。二月间，荷兰高级军官联合会的机关报《昂斯·利格》发表了某一名为盖因休斯的文章，他力主对苏联作战，并在这个战争中使用原子弹、毒害农作物的细菌武器等。由于帝国主义统治者的授意，吃人生番的叫嚣，歇斯底里的咆哮和恫吓性的咒骂的黑色浪潮已渗透到文化的各方面，毒害着资本主义各国的文学、广播和电影。
    美国报纸向读者介绍像默礼斯所作的《死去的炉火》那样的小说时，心花怒放地说：这本书告诉了美国普通老百姓一件极端重要的大事情，就是准备“敌人”突然袭击美国的大城市（！）。这本小说宣扬必需扩充军备，普通老百姓必须准备忍受最艰苦的灾难，因为这种灾难是不可避免的。
    电影院放映着关于美国侵略者在朝鲜的海盗冒险的影片。受惊的观众看到一堆一堆的死尸，冒烟的城镇的废墟以及在附近高视阔步的“胜利者”。从他们那副神气看来，侵略者好像可以为所欲为，没有什么力量能够阻止他们似的。这些影片的无耻是令人恶心的；同时，它们又极其卑鄙地吹牛，特别是因为全世界都知道美国的“勇士们”在朝鲜已一再遭受到惨败。
    神志失常的参议员和部长们，唯利是图的新闻记者和冒牌作家们，巨大的新闻垄断企业和广播公司的老板们，都被用来作为以战争和杀人的思想毒害人民这种卑污勾当的工具。
    斯大林最近向真理报记者的谈话已极明确地揭露了战争宣传者所追求的目的。
    斯大林已经指出：在美国、英国和法国，有着侵略的势力渴望新的战争。这些人就是那些财产以百万和亿万计的富豪们。他们惧怕他们本国不要另一次战争而主张维持和平的人民，所以他们力图利用反动政府以谎言的罗网去陷害他们的人民，欺骗人民，并且把新战争说成防御战争，把爱好和平国家的和平政策说成侵略政策。他们力图欺骗他们的人民，以便强使他们的人民实行他们的侵略计划，并将他们的人民拖入另一次战争之中。
    资本主义国家的反动统治者力图使人民相信战争是不可避免的。但是，正像这些统治者所说的每一句话一样，都是彻头彻尾的谎言。
    如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。斯大林的这些言论鼓舞着和平战士们，使他们对于世界和平事业的最后胜利具有不可动摇的信心，因此，这些言论就巩固了和平战士的队伍。
    在全世界各地，反对战争、反对生活军事化、反对苛捐杂税、反对日益增加的生活费用和贫穷——这些都是军备竞赛的必然产物——的运动正一天天发展。人民赞成普遍裁减军备、要求过和平的生活、反对新的军事冒险。
    参加保卫和平运动的人民群众愈来愈多了，在工人阶级、农民、城市中产阶级和民主知识分子中间有愈来愈多的和平战士参加了这个运动，具有各种不同的宗教信仰和政治信仰的人也参加了这个运动。
    在世界各国，包括美国在内，反对朝鲜战争、要求以和平方式解决朝鲜战争和停止对远东的侵略的大规模抗议运动正在不断地进行着。抗议的怒潮是由组织所谓“北大西洋军队”的计划引起来的；欧洲人民一致要求前来访问的这支军队的总司令、美国的艾森豪威尔滚回美国去！许多个月以来，法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时和挪威的英勇的码头工人一直在拒绝起卸抵达西欧海港的美国军火。法国和意大利的工厂工人拒绝为战争工作，并举行罢工以保卫他们的切身权利。
    欧洲人民反对重新武装西德的声势浩大的运动，正在我们眼前发展着。经历过两次世界大战的法、波、捷、比以及其他与德国接壤的国家的人民群众以及德国自己的人民正在坚决反对美国的恢复德国军国主义的计划。他们知道，恢复德国军国主义意味着在美国亿万富翁指使下准备发动另一次战争。他们知道，恢复德国军国主义是对战争贩子有利的，并且会使国际和平不能维持。今天谁要想维持和平就必须为反对恢复德国军国主义而斗争，为反对使德国人民变成美国战争贩子的炮灰而斗争。第二届世界和平大会的要求一切国家的政府禁止罪恶的战争宣传的宣言，已受到全世界千百万人民的衷心拥护。
    苏联人民热烈拥护这个宣言。在苏维埃国土上，新战争宣传是没有立足之地的。苏联人民的整个生活都是建筑在与帝国主义国家的民众生活截然不同的原则之上。苏联人民的整个的生活方式不可能有宣扬屠杀和侵略其他国家的思想。
    一个苏联的公民从他的孩提的时代、从他的幼年的时代开始，他就生活在这样一个世界中，在那里他听不到任何人发表有关侵略和征服其他国家的人民、蔑视操他种语言或不同肤色的人民的言论。苏联人民看不到宣扬憎恨、杀人及罪恶的书籍。他看不到描述抢掠者和杀人者的冒险的电影，他也看不到召唤他参加侵略战争、去征服欧洲和亚洲国家的戏剧。
    他的生活是幸福而合理的。他竭尽他的才能去为他的人民和祖国服务。他全心全意致力于和平的创造性的劳动上、以及文化、科学和艺术的发展上。
    英明的布尔什维克党不倦地向苏联人民灌输深深尊重其他民族的精神、承认所有民族一律平等和巩固它们之间的友谊的精神。受到了党的社会主义的人道主义的高尚思想教育的苏联作家们，描绘苏维埃社会的人民、描绘伟大卫国战争中的英雄、以及从事伟大共产主义建设的英雄。苏联的画家们反映了我们祖国生活中的历史性事件和我国的城市和乡村的各方面的令人感动的变化。苏联的演员们在戏剧中扮演怀有为苏维埃祖国服务的高尚理想的人们。苏联的电影以忠于社会主义理想和全心全意为祖国服务的精神教育着年青的一代。我们永远用不着像世界和平大会关于谴责战争宣传的决议所要求的那样来“坚决地抵制”小说、电影剧本、舞台剧本、或绘画，因为在苏联没有画家或作家会煽动战争或鼓吹侵略。
    我们赞成第二届世界和平大会要求各国议会通过保卫和平法案的建议。我们相信，当战争宣传的污浊浪潮席卷美、英及其他帝国主义国家的时候，人们将用一切可能的办法来保卫世界的和平。各国人民不能容忍某些国家的侵略集团现在公然进行新战争的宣传而逍遥法外，因为各国人民在三十年间已经遭受了两次战争的可怕灾害。苏联人民把战争宣传认为是对人类的最严重的罪行。
    代表同志们！请允许我提出下述的保卫和平法草案，以供苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃审议。
    保卫和平法：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃在苏联的爱好和平政策的崇高原则指导下，为巩固和平与各国的友好关系，认为在三十年间身受两次世界大战的浩劫的全世界人民的良知与正义感，不能容忍某些国家的侵略集团肆无忌惮地进行战争宣传，并且拥护第二届世界和平大会的宣言，因为这个宣言表示了全体进步人类要求禁止和谴责罪恶的战争宣传的愿望。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃规定：（一）不论是任何形式的战争宣传，都应视为破坏和平事业、制造新战争威胁，因而是危害人类的最严重的罪行。（二）凡犯宣传战争罪行者均应交付法庭，作为罪大恶极的罪犯加以审讯。”（暴风雨般历久不绝的鼓掌。）
    代表同志们！无疑地，苏联人民将一致欢呼苏联最高苏维埃通过保卫和平法。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    苏联最高苏维埃的通过保卫和平法，将是苏联人民致力于和平事业的又一次证明，是我们的和平愿望的又一次证明。
    这个法律的通过，将是对以诽谤爱好和平的人民为生的一切恶毒的战争宣传者、对一切憎恨人类的帝国主义侵略者的雇佣奴仆们的有效打击，保卫和平法的通过，将是苏维埃国家对保卫和平事业、保卫人类之最佳成就的又一次贡献。
    同时，我国最高权力机关——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃——所通过并批准的保卫和平法，将进一步巩固和平战士的阵营，而且将使一切和平战士获得新的力量并巩固他们对于正义的和平事业必能获胜的信心。（经久不绝的鼓掌）苏联人民坚定地相信：和平事业必将获得最后胜利——进步人类的胜利，因为苏联人民正在他们的伟大领袖、和平的第一名旗手、我们自己的斯大林同志的领导下，向着共产主义的灿烂前途迈进！（暴风雨般经久不息的鼓掌，最后变成欢呼。大家喊道：“斯大林同志万岁，乌拉！”）
