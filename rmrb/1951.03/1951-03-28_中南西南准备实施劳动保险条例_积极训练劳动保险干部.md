　　The trade unions and labor administration departments at all levels in the Central-South region are actively carrying out various preparations for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations. Trade unions in various provinces and cities have successively held cadre meetings to specifically arrange the preparatory work. Local grassroots trade unions are also conducting publicity and education work among employees. As of the 17th of this month, provinces and cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Henan, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have successively started labor insurance cadre training classes. Participants include vice-chairmen of grassroots trade unions, labor insurance committee members, enterprise administrative personnel responsible for labor insurance, and responsible cadres from regional and county trade unions and labor bureaus in public and private enterprises preparing to implement labor insurance. The training period is two to three weeks. After returning to their original positions, the trained cadres will start amateur training classes in their respective units to ensure that the labor insurance system is implemented in every team. Before the end of March, grassroots trade unions in enterprises implementing labor insurance will establish labor insurance committees and expenditure review committees, and register employees who are entitled to labor insurance benefits in their respective units. Currently, enterprises preparing to implement labor insurance in various regions are applying for registration with the local labor bureaus. In Wuhan, 39 enterprise units have been approved after review, with over 22,000 employees. Branches and offices of the People's Bank of China in various regions have also begun collecting labor insurance funds from approved and registered units since March 10th. Administrative leading organs such as the Central-South Labor Department, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Transportation have also issued instructions and notices in recent days, requiring their affiliated units to conscientiously pay labor insurance funds, transfer labor insurance cadres, enrich medical equipment, and help trade unions solve the problems of housing and furniture needed for the implementation of labor insurance.

Preparations and publicity for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations in public and private factories and mines in the Southwest region are being stepped up. The Labor Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee convened a conference of administrative, trade union cadres, and medical workers from enterprise departments of various provinces and cities the day after the Labor Insurance Regulations were promulgated. The conference reviewed the work related to protecting workers' health and safety in the past year and decided to quickly improve the organization of worker health and welfare protection in various factories and establish medical treatment institutions and dedicated systems, as well as setting up workshop first-aid stations and first-aid groups. Labor bureaus in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Eastern Sichuan, Guizhou, and other regions have also successively convened administrative and capitalist parties of larger factories and mines to discuss and check the specific methods for labor protection and application for labor insurance registration. In order to prepare cadres, various regions have opened labor insurance personnel training classes in early March, drawing over a thousand cadres from various industrial trade unions and grassroots trade unions to participate in the study.
Among the working masses, a wave of celebration and study of the Labor Insurance Regulations is unfolding. Most factories in Chongqing generally held celebration meetings or symposiums. In various meetings and learning discussions, the workers recounted the various persecutions and sufferings they suffered during the rule of the reactionary government, which further inspired their love for today's new society. Female workers in Chongqing recalled the suffering they had experienced in the past when giving birth. In the past, they could not get leave before giving birth, and some children were born in the workshop. In order to avoid being discovered by the factory, they had to put the newborns in the wastepaper basket in the toilet. In the year before liberation, the infant mortality rate in various factories was as high as 30.2%. Among the 474 infants born in the 610, Shashi, and Yuxin factories before liberation in 1949, 186 died due to miscarriage, stillbirth, and postpartum disorders caused by the lack of leave for pregnant and postpartum women. Coal miners recalled the situation in the past when their lives were as cheap as cattle and horses and felt more affectionate and cherished the implementation of today's Labor Insurance Regulations. The Chongqing Tianfu Coal Mine suffered two major explosions before liberation in 1949 due to the factory's lack of attention to safety equipment. Many workers were killed in the mines and did not receive the due compensation. Now they expressed that they would celebrate the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations with actions to vigorously reform enterprises and improve product quality.
The Federations of Industry and Commerce in various provinces and cities and the capitalist parties of various factories have also held meetings recently to discuss the Labor Insurance Regulations. The Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce led eight industry associations to actively study the Labor Insurance Regulations through large classes and group discussions. Currently, the capitalist parties of twelve factories have registered with the Municipal Labor Bureau.

　　中南西南准备实施劳动保险条例
    积极训练劳动保险干部
    中南各级工会和劳动行政部门，积极进行实施劳动保险条例的各项准备工作。各省市工会已先后召开了干部会议，具体布置准备工作。各地基层工会也正对职工进行宣传教育工作。到本月十七日为止，武汉、广州、河南、广西、湖北、湖南、江西等省市，都已先后开办了劳动保险干部训练班。参加学习的有各地准备实施劳动保险的公私企业基层工会的副主席、劳动保险委员、企业行政方面负责劳动保险工作者及专区、县工会和劳动局的负责干部。训练时间两周到三周。受训干部返回原来岗位后，将再开办本单位的业余训练班，以便使劳动保险制度贯彻到每个小组中去。三月底以前，实行劳动保险企业的基层工会将成立劳动保险委员会及经费审查委员会，并进行对各该单位应享受劳动保险待遇的职工的登记工作。现在，各地准备实施劳动保险的企业，正纷纷向当地劳动局申请登记。武汉市现经审查合格的有三十九个企业单位，职工二万二千余人。各地中国人民银行分行、办事处，亦自三月十日起，开始代收已被核准登记的单位所缴纳的劳动保险金。中南劳动部、工业部、交通部等行政领导机关，亦都在日前发出执行劳动保险条例的指示和通知，要求其所属单位认真缴纳劳动保险基金、抽调劳动保险干部、充实医疗设备及帮助工会解决实行劳动保险时所需要的房子、家具等问题。

    西南公私营厂矿实施劳动保险条例的准备和宣传工作正加紧进行中。西南军政委员会劳动部于劳动保险条例公布的第二天即召开了各省、市企业部门的行政、工会干部和医务工作者大会，检查了去年一年中有关保护工人健康和安全方面的工作，决定迅速健全各厂保护工人健康福利工作的组织，并建立医务治疗机构和专责制度，设立车间急救站、急救小组。重庆、成都、昆明、川东、贵州等地区的劳动局也先后召集了较大厂矿的行政方面和资方，座谈检查劳动保护工作和申请实行劳动保险登记等工作的具体办法。为了准备干部，各地已于三月初开办了劳动保险人员训练班，抽调了各产业工会和基层工会的干部千余人参加学习。
    在工人群众中，一个对劳动保险条例的庆祝和学习的热潮正在展开。重庆市大部工厂普遍举行了庆祝会或座谈会。在各种会议和学习讨论中，工人们诉说了反动政府统治时期他们所受的种种迫害和痛苦，更加激发了对今天新社会的热爱。重庆市女工们追述了她们过去生孩子的受罪情形。过去她们因为在临产之前得不到休假，有些孩子就在车间生了下来。为了怕被厂方发觉，她们只好把生下的孩子放在厕所的纸篓里。解放前一年，各厂的婴孩死亡率高达百分之三十点二。六一零、沙市、渝新三厂在一九四九年解放前所生的四百七十四个婴孩中，因孕妇、产妇无假期而致小产、死产和产后失调而死的，就有一百八十六人。煤矿工人回忆起他们过去生命贱如牛马的情景，对今天劳动保险条例的实施，更加感到亲切和珍重。重庆天府煤矿在一九四九年解放前因厂方不注意安全设备，曾发生两次大爆炸，许多工人被炸死在矿坑，并且得不到应有的抚恤待遇。现在他们表示要以努力改革企业、提高产品质量的行动，来庆祝劳动保险条例的实施。
    各省、市的工商联合会和各厂的资方，最近也都召开会议，进行了关于劳动保险条例的讨论。重庆市工商联合会领导了八个行业公会采取上大课、小组讨论的方式，积极学习劳动保险条例。现已有十二个厂的资方到市劳动局进行登记。
