Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 26th: A large number of letters of condolence and newspapers from the people of the motherland, which have arrived at the front lines, have brought infinite courage and strength to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

A certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the front line received more than 60,000 letters of condolence in one instance. Together with those received in the past, the unit has received more than 80,000 letters of condolence. In addition, there were large bundles of newspapers such as the Liberation Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Hui Pao, News Daily, and Xinmin Pao, all printed with the red characters "Salute to the Heroic Volunteer Army," and the condolence collection of the China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression. The various military postal stations of the Volunteer Army on the front lines are working day and night to distribute these letters to the various units. With excitement and gratitude, the mail clerks paired up the postal packages sent from different regions of the motherland and distributed them. They said, "Let every unit know that all the Chinese people are offering condolences to us." Then, the traffic officers delivered these letters overnight by truck, horse, and bicycle to the front-line commanders and fighters.

The troops fighting on the front lines received the letters of condolence on the artillery-filled positions. They immediately relayed and read them in the trenches, expressing their determination to answer the people of the motherland by annihilating more invading troops. One company received a batch of letters of condolence at the battlefield. The instructor immediately distributed these letters to the soldiers. Soldier Wang Baotian received a letter from a student, which read: "In order to prevent the Korean people from being enslaved by the American bandits, and for the safety of our new motherland, you resolutely left your relatives and went to the front line to fight the American invading army in the freezing cold. This is your glory, and it is also the glory of our motherland. I wish you greater victories in fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army." He read the letter and was extremely excited, and read it aloud so that the comrades around him could hear it. At this time, the enemy began to attack again. All the warriors of the company cherished the letters of condolence from the motherland in their hearts and calmly met the enemy. After killing and wounding a large number of enemies, they bravely jumped out of the trenches and pursued the defeated remnants.

The letters of condolence received by the Volunteer Army came from major cities and remote villages in the motherland. Countless young workers, students, farmers who had been allocated land, elderly mothers, and Young Pioneer members who were slightly literate brought in their letters the infinite love and gratitude of the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army. They called the Volunteer Army the "pride" of the motherland. The peasants of Daliugou, Sixth District, Mianyang County, Hubei, wrote: "You fought hard and repeatedly defeated the American invading army in Korea, ensuring the smooth completion of the anti-despot and emancipation movement in our village. All the old and young in the village are grateful to you." The workers of a certain mine in Leping, Jiangxi, wrote: "More than a thousand employees of our mine are determined to make the greatest efforts to carry out patriotic competitions and support you with practical actions." The employees of the No. 873 locomotive crew of the Hengyang Railway Trade Union in Hunan wrote: "Your victory has greatly encouraged us. We must create greater achievements in order to complete the new task for 1951."

What particularly moved the Volunteer Army were the cordial greetings from the elderly mothers and children. An old military属 aunt in her fifties wrote: "Children, in order to support you, I have sent my second child to join the army." Liu Lianben, a student from De No. 1 Elementary School in Jilin, wrote on a piece of paper from his exercise book: "Dear Volunteer Army brothers: I am so happy that you have won the battle. When I grow up, I will definitely learn from your example and serve the motherland." The letters of condolence from writers Ding Ling and Wei Jinzhi and others were warmly welcomed by the commanders and fighters on the front lines. A certain unit printed it in the front-line newspaper and distributed it to various units.

In order to respond to the enthusiastic condolences and support of the people of the motherland, the leading organ of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army specially issued instructions, calling on all commanders and fighters to keep in mind the love and hope of the people of the motherland, redouble their fighting will, and fight for the liberation of all Korea and to defend the motherland.

　　朝鲜前线志愿军传读祖国人民慰问信
    斗志加强，誓为解放全朝鲜并为保卫祖国而奋战。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】运抵前线的祖国人民的大批慰问信件与报刊，给我国人民志愿军将士们带来无限的勇气与力量。
    前线志愿军某部，一次就收到六万多封慰问信，连同过去收到的算在一起，该部共已收到慰问信八万余封。此外，还有大捆印着“向英雄的志愿军致敬”几个红字的解放日报、大公报、文汇报、新闻日报、新民报等报纸，和中国人民抗美援朝总会的慰问专集。前线志愿军的各个军邮站，正日夜忙碌着把这些信件分发到各部队。收发员们怀着兴奋与感激的心情，把从祖国不同地区寄来的邮包搭配着分发出去。他们说：“让我们每个部队都知道，全中国人民都在慰问我们。然后，交通员们连夜用卡车、马匹与脚踏车把这些信件分别送到前线指挥员战斗员们手中去。
    战斗在前线的部队在炮火弥漫的阵地上接到了慰问信。他们立即在战壕里传送朗读，纷纷表达决心，一定要以消灭更多的进犯军来回答祖国人民。有一个连队在战地接到一批慰问信，指导员立即将这些信件分发给战士们。战士王保田收到了一位学生的信，信上写道：“你们为了使朝鲜人民不受美国强盗奴役，为了我们新生祖国的安全，毅然离开了自己的亲人，走上前线，在冰天雪地里与美国侵略军作战，这是你们的光荣，也是我们祖国的光荣。祝你们在和朝鲜人民军并肩作战中获得更大的胜利。”他读了这封信，兴奋极了，又把它大声念起来，好让周围的战友都听到。这时，敌人又开始了进攻。全连勇士们把来自祖国的慰问信珍爱地揣在怀里，沉着地迎击敌人。他们在杀伤大批敌人后又勇猛地跳出战壕，追击溃败的残敌。
    志愿军收到的慰问信来自祖国的各大城市和偏僻的乡村。无数青年的工人们、学生们、分得土地的农民们、年老的母亲们和稍通文字的少年儿童队队员们，在他们所写的信中，带来了祖国人民对志愿军无限的热爱和感激。他们称志愿军是祖国的“骄傲”。湖北沔阳县六区大刘沟农民们写道：“你们艰苦作战，在朝鲜屡次打败了美国侵略军，保证了我村反恶霸翻身运动的顺利完成，全村老少都感激你们。”江西乐平某矿职工们写道：“我矿千余职工誓以最大努力，开展爱国主义竞赛，以实际行动支援你们。”湖南衡阳铁路工会八七三号机车包乘组职工写道：“你们的胜利大大地鼓舞了我们，我们一定为完成一九五一年新任务，创造出更大的成绩。”
    特别使志愿军感动的是那些年老的母亲和儿童们亲切的致意。一位五十岁的军属大娘写道：“孩子们，为了支援你们，我把第二个孩子也送去参军了。”吉林德一小学学生刘连本在练习簿的纸上写道：“亲爱的志愿军哥哥：你们打了胜仗，我真欢喜。我长大了一定学习你们的榜样，为祖国服务。”作家丁玲和魏金枝等人的慰问信，受到前线指战员们的热烈欢迎。某部并把它印在火线报上，分发各部。
    为了答复祖国人民热诚的慰问与支援，志愿军某部领导机关特别发布了指示，号召全体指挥员战斗员牢记祖国人民的热爱与希望，百倍地加强战斗意志，为解放全朝鲜，为保卫祖国而奋战。
