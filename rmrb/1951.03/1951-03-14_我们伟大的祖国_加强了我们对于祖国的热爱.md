    “Our Great Motherland”
     Strengthens Our Love for the Motherland
     Liang Yong from Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station writes:
    The "Our Great Motherland" photos published daily in the People's Daily have been embraced by the broad masses and cadres. As soon as our cadres in the organization receive the People's Daily, they look at the "Our Great Motherland" photos first. Some comrades even cut them out and carefully preserve them in their notebooks. Because from these pictures, we gain much knowledge and education, making us understand even more how great and lovable our motherland is, increasing our love for the motherland and our confidence in building it.
    When I went home this time, I took these pictures to show my grandfather. He was happy after seeing them and said, "Our China is so good, who wouldn't love her?" When he saw the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the snowy and icy Korean battlefield, he was even happier and said, "Well done! The American imperialists are such bad guys, truly a toad wanting to eat swan meat!" He also pointed to Tiananmen and asked me, "Is Chairman Mao's portrait hanging there?" I told him, "This is Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and Chairman Mao declared the founding of our People's Republic of China on top of it."
    I also showed them to the children and read the captions to them one by one. They were all very happy. Duan Lanying, a thirteen-year-old girl, raised her fist after seeing them and said, "I also want to resist America and aid Korea, and defend the motherland!" In the end, they asked me to leave the pictures and requested that I buy them a few more copies.
    Judging from these small things, I personally believe that using pictures for propaganda has a great effect, especially in our vast rural areas with low levels of education. Adults and children alike are willing to look at pictures, and by looking at pictures, they can learn many things. This can also enhance the people's love for the motherland and their confidence in building it, as well as arouse their hatred for American imperialism.
    I suggest that the People's Daily print the "Our Great Motherland" photos into separate booklets on a monthly basis and promote them to the vast rural areas.
    Editor's Note: Reader Liang Yong's suggestion that the newspaper should publish more photos and illustrations is an important one. We will strive to achieve it. Printing "Our Great Motherland" pictures into separate booklets is not yet possible under the current conditions, but we will begin to select articles in preparation for future publication.
  Zhao Qi, a Chinese language teacher at Hushan Middle School in Andong County, Liaodong Province, writes:
    "Our Great Motherland" provides us with rich education in loving the motherland. When we receive the People's Daily every day, everyone wants to read this section first. From history, from every bit of production and construction, we see various concrete and real content, enriching readers' past abstract understandings of "long history, vast territory, and abundant resources." For example, the "Great Hall of Foguang Temple on Mount Wutai, a Tang Dynasty building" in issue 969 and the "Wooden Pagoda of Fogong Temple in Ying County, Chahar" in issue 970 aroused our respect for the working people in our motherland's history, and corrected the erroneous idea of excessively praising foreign architecture and belittling our own country's architecture. It turns out that our architecture has a unique style in the history of world architecture. This educates us to look at history from a historical perspective, which improves and enriches our teaching work. "Our Great Motherland" educates us to "love our motherland." However, some photos are not artistic enough, such as the advanced producers of the Fushun Coal Mine on February 11 and the three-dimensional model of the "Peking Man" living environment on February 19, the composition is not very beautiful and also very blurry. Secondly, I think the captions should also be interspersed with poems or maxims; otherwise, it becomes a straightforward description. In addition, I hope to introduce some of the great achievements in literature and art in history (such as Qu Yuan, Du Fu... Water Margin, Dream of the Red Chamber... Lu Xun).
    Editor's Note: Mr. Zhao hopes to introduce the great achievements in literature and art in our country's history in the "Our Great Motherland" column. We completely agree and hope that readers from all over the country will actively contribute.

### “我们伟大的祖国”  加强了我们对于祖国的热爱

    “我们伟大的祖国”
     加强了我们对于祖国的热爱
     山西人民广播电台梁勇来信说：
    人民日报上每天登的“我们伟大的祖国”照片，已受到广大群众和干部们的热爱。我们机关里的干部，一接到人民日报，就先看“我们伟大的祖国”照片。有些同志还把它剪下来贴在本子上小心的保存着。因为从这里使我们得到了许多知识和教育，使我们更懂得我们的祖国伟大和可爱，增加了我们对于祖国的热爱和建设祖国的信心。
    我这次回家曾把这些图片拿给我老爷看，他看了高兴地说：“咱们中国这么好，谁还能不爱她。”当他看到中国人民志愿军在冰天雪地的朝鲜战场上打仗时，他更高兴地说：“打得好，美帝国主义这个坏东西，真是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉哩。”他还指着天安门问我：“毛主席的像这是挂在那儿？”我告诉他说：“这是北京的天安门，毛主席就是在这上头宣布咱中华人民共和国成立的。”
    我又拿上让儿童们看，并且一张一张地把说明文念给他们听，他们都十分高兴。十三岁的小儿童段兰英她看了以后举着拳头说：“我也要抗美援朝，保卫祖国。”他们最后还叫我把图片留下，还要求再给他们多买几本。
    从以上这些很小的事情看来，我个人认为用图画来宣传，这个作用是很大的，尤其是在我们文化程度低的广大农村里更为需要。大人小孩都愿意看画，一边看画就能知道许多事情。这样也能提高人民群众对祖国的热爱和建设的信心，以及激发他们对美帝国主义的仇恨。
    我建议人民日报把“我们伟大的祖国”的照片按月印成单行本，把它推广到广大的农村中去。
    编者按：读者梁勇提出报纸要多登照片图画，这是一个重要的意见。我们将努力实现它。把“我们伟大的祖国”图片印成单行本，目前条件还不够，但我们将着手进行选稿以备将来印行。
  辽东省安东县弧山中学国文教员赵起来信提出：
    “我们伟大的祖国”给我们的爱祖国教育是丰富的，当我们每天接到人民日报时，大家都要先来朗读这一段文字。从历史上，从一点一滴的出产上、建设上看到各种具体而又真实的内容，充实了读者过去的“历史悠久地大物博”的一些抽象认识。如九六九期上的“唐代建筑的五台山佛光寺的大殿”和第九七○期的“察哈尔应县佛宫寺的木塔”就曾引起了我们对于祖国历史上的劳动人民的崇敬，更改正了对外国建筑的过高夸赞而和卑视自己祖国的建筑的错误思想。原来我们的建筑是在世界建筑史上独具风格的。这就教育了我们要用历史的观点来看历史，对于我们的教学工作是提高和充实了。“我们伟大的祖国”教育了我们“热爱祖国”。可是有几幅照像不够艺术，如二月十一日抚顺煤矿的先进生产者和二月十九日的“中国猿人”生活的立体模型构图不甚美化，又很模糊不清。其次是我觉得说明文也应杂以诗歌，或格言，不然成了一个直套。另外是希望把历史上的文学艺术方面的伟大成就也介绍一些（如屈原，杜甫……水浒、红楼……鲁迅）。
    编者按：赵先生希望在“我们伟大的祖国”栏介绍我国历史上文学艺术方面的伟大成就，我们完全同意，希望各地读者踊跃来稿。
