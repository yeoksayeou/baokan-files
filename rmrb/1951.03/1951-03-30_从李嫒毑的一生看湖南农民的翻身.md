　　Looking at the Emancipation of Hunan Peasants Through the Life of Li Aijie
    Li Aijie ("Aijie" means mother, "jie" pronounces like "ye") is a short, gaunt old woman from the Hu Tu family in Xinzhuang Village, Gangkou Township, Yueyang, with only a few worm-eaten teeth left. Her high, withered cheekbones are covered with wrinkles, and her eyes are often filled with tears. She is actually fifty-three years old, but she looks old, like someone in their late seventies. Before liberation, she often carried a basket, dragging an eight-year-old boy (named Manzi) and a sixteen-year-old girl (named Liao Zhen), begging for food throughout the township, and was the most despised figure by the landlords in the countryside.
    The land reform in Gangkou Township began at the end of November last year. On the afternoon of January 25 this year, the first branch of the Gangkou Township Farmers' Association held an emancipation conference in front of the Hu Tu family's courtyard. In fifty-four days, Li Aijie, like thousands upon thousands of peasants who were saved by the land reform, completely changed. She not only received land, her son went to elementary school, her daughter, who had been promised to a consumptive person as a child bride, got divorced, and even her own spine, which had been crushed by the demons of the old world, straightened up.
    Her life can be said to be a milestone in the struggle of the vast number of Chinese peasants from the bottomless abyss of feudal society to the broad road of the new democracy. It is engraved with the various experiences of the peasants in the midst of this painful process, and also marks the various crimes of the landlord class, imperialism, and the Kuomintang bandit gang colluding with each other.

            A Thick Account Book
    Based on her speeches at the grievance and struggle meetings, I have analyzed the thick account book of exploitation and harm done to her by the man-eating old society:
    She lost her mother when she was two years old, and her father was a shoemaker. A widower who made a living by his craft was, of course, very strained to raise a child, and both father and daughter couldn't get enough to eat. Therefore, at the age of eight, she was sent to someone else's house to be a child bride. Her mother-in-law was very fierce, requiring her to carry several loads of water from the pond every day, spin three taels of yarn, and also farm the land and feed the pigs. Even with such labor, she could not avoid being beaten and scolded. Sometimes, she was even dragged out of bed in the middle of the night to be beaten. When she married at fifteen, her husband was an idler who did nothing and gambled on the streets all day long. She worked as a helper in the landlord's house: sweeping the floor, cooking, and washing clothes for more than a dozen people. At the age of twenty-one, she gave birth to a child, but because there was no milk to feed him, the child soon starved to death. At this time, her mother-in-law was still as fierce to her, and her husband was still as idle. After working in the landlord's house for six years, she secretly saved one hundred strings of copper coins (fifty coins per string). She used those one hundred strings of coins to redeem her freedom and remarry to Hu Yuangui, a farmhand from the Hu Tu family.
    "To earn animal money, you need to sleep like an animal," which describes the life they lived in the landlord's house. They ate leftovers and lived in a cowshed. Hu Yuangui was covered in mud all year round. He plowed the fields in the spring, and the frozen mud clods in the fields cut his soles until the skin was broken and bleeding. In June, he operated the waterwheel, and he would fall asleep on the waterwheel frame in the middle of the night. In August, he harvested grass, and he would harvest until late at night. He produced more than seventy stones of grain a year, but he himself did not necessarily earn ten stones of grain. Hu Yuangui's body was weak. During the dog days of summer, operating the waterwheel under the sun that was like a brazier, he finally fainted. The wolf-hearted and dog-lunged landlord didn't even bother to buy a pack of medicine.
    Li Aijie, this short, gaunt woman, gave birth to quite a few children. She had a total of thirteen children with her second husband. Besides the two by her side, there was one who sailed boats in Yueyang, and the other ten had already died prematurely. The children died in the following ways: (A) Under the reactionary rule, adults didn't have enough to eat, so naturally they couldn't raise children. After the child was born, her breasts were dry. The child was so thin that the skin covered the bones. As for blankets, they were too poor to even have a wrapping cloth. They borrowed a bundle of straw from a kind-hearted neighbor, covering the child while burning some of it for warmth; the more they burned, the thinner it became, and after a few days, the child still froze to death. (B) With great difficulty, they managed to raise a boy by begging for rice from door to door, but one night, a barking dog signaled that he was seized by the Kuomintang as a conscript. Several boys from the nearby landlord and rich peasant families were never conscripted. Only her boy was seized. Once he was seized, he never came back. (Before liberation, she was most afraid of dogs barking in the village at night. Every time she heard a bark, she thought they were coming to seize conscripts again.) (C) Several children developed very common illnesses, having fevers or diarrhea, but they died simply because there was no money for treatment. One of them had been raised to the age of eight! (D) She sobbed and admitted: She had cruelly strangled the eighth child to death in a basin of water. At the time, she rationally thought: Rather than let him live for a few more days and then die, it was better to let him suffer less. But afterwards, she cried for several days, and her eyes were ruined. After that, she could never bring herself to do it again.
    Hu Yuangui was a hardworking and honest peasant, and they had a very good relationship. During the period of occupation, he was pulled by a landlord who was a puppet Ba長 to work for the Japanese devils. He worked for nothing, and if he didn't please them, he would be severely beaten with a stick. Since he fainted in the fields during those dog days of summer, his body had become even weaker. This time, he almost crawled home. His whole body was soaked in blood. She sold everything she had to treat him. His body festered with pus, he coughed up blood, and maggots crawled on his wounds. Finally, one evening, he breathed his last.
    The result of thirty years of labor for the couple was a pitifully small plot of land. In order to hire a doctor and buy a coffin, she borrowed some grain from a landlord. Soon after the burial, that black-hearted landlord used the "lion rolling the ball" interest to roll her clean. From the age of eight, she worked as a beast of burden. After forty-five years, she was left with two dilapidated thatched huts, a stove made of three bricks, and the fate of a beggar.

            A Throne Built on Skulls
    "He would pluck a feather even from a crow passing by." Li Aijie used this vivid phrase to describe the landlord who exploited her, but she only described the landlord's greed, and had not yet touched on their various base and cruel acts of pulling laborers and conscripts for the reactionaries, embezzling dyke fees, and seizing public land.
    Less than two miles from Li Aijie's two thatched huts in the Hu Tu family was the most imposing courtyard house of the landlord Yu Tieshan in Xinzhuang Village. From far away on the ridges, one could see the towering roof ridges protruding from the sparse woods, like the broad shoulders of a burly man, pressing down on the cluster of peasants' thatched huts. The gate of Yu Tieshan's house in Xinzhuang could accommodate eight-man sedan chairs, and the carvings on both sides of the gate were meticulously crafted by artisans. After the land reform began, the landlord Yu Tieshan dared not step out of the courtyard. Some landless poor peasants temporarily lived inside. Diapers and tattered clothes were hung to dry along the carved walls. However, the landlord's prestige of the past was not difficult to see. The courtyards, connected one after another, were hung with plaques "Bestowed by the Emperor" or "Inscribed by Local Gentry", with large Yan-style characters engraved with phrases like "Deeply Rooted". The ancestral tablets traced back more than twenty generations. On one side of the central hall was placed an empty sedan chair - symbolizing the prestige of the landlord class riding on the necks of the peasants yesterday - and on the other side was appropriately placed a coffin.
    From the furniture used by the landlord, one can also imagine the leisure and extravagance of this feudal exploiting class in the past. The four-poster bed, painted in red and gilded, was covered with a tiger skin mattress. Inside the bed, there were also small drawers for storing snacks and deer antler and white fungus. The pillows were embroidered with English words like "Sweet Dreams". Few landlords were not fond of "elegance". Besides thread-bound books, erotic novels lithographed in the early years of the Republic of China often occupied most of the landlord's collection.
    All these ostentations, all these "elegances," were stained with the blood of the farmhand Hu Yuangui and his large number of prematurely deceased children. The eaves are made of human bones, and the tiles are made of human skin. The throne of the feudal landlord is built on their skulls.

            She Suddenly Understood
    Militarily, Hunan was liberated in the autumn of 1949, but Li Aijie, like thousands upon thousands of peasants in the Central South Region, did not take her first breath until the second half of last year. During the rent and interest reduction, she reduced three stones of grain and also received four silver dollars in interest. More importantly, after liberation, her status in the countryside invisibly rose. She could help people pick cotton and spin yarn. Last year, she also bought new clothes for both Manzi and Liao Zhen.
    When the land reform work team first arrived in Gangkou Township, Li Aijie, like the poor peasants and farmhands who had been oppressed for the longest time, did not immediately become active. Ideologically, she still believed in fatalistic theories created by the ruling class throughout the ages, such as "What is destined to come will come, and what is not destined should not be forced." While hating the landlord class to the bone, she also worried about another bloody Year Sixteen of the Republic of China, when the restored landlords would turn around and chop off heads. At first, she was afraid that the farmers' association would not want her as a beggar, and still thought that the world was a world for "respectable people," not for honest people. She was also vague about the question of whether landlords supported the peasants, or whether the peasants supported the landlords. Some peasants even thought, since Chairman Mao intends to help us peasants, why not print some banknotes and buy the landlords' fields and distribute them?
    At that time, some middle and rich peasants in the village seemed more active in the land reform, or at least understood what it was all about. They had seen it in the newspapers a long time ago. The landlords' lackeys were even more slippery than loaches. However, the land reform work team focused on the peasants like Li Aijie who were poorly dressed, had dirty homes, and spoke as if they didn't understand anything, and took root specifically in them. The cadres went to Li Aijie's home, helped her with work, and talked to her, finally drawing out her tragic experiences in life. She cried as she recounted them, and the cadres couldn't help but cry too.
    At this time, Li Aijie suddenly understood who killed her husband and children, and understood that the landlord was not destined to sleep on a tiger skin mattress, but because Hu Yuangui's annual seventy stones of grain were withheld by the landlord by sixty stones.
    She also understood from the current affairs propaganda that the Kuomintang was completely finished this time. They had chilled the hearts of the Chinese people and would never come back. She understood that fate was in the hands of the poor themselves. If the landlord class was not overthrown, Manzi and Liao Zhen would not have a good life.
    After figuring it out, whatever meetings were held, this short, gaunt old woman would be the first to arrive; if there were meetings at night, even if they were in other villages, she would hold a torch and run to participate, stepping deep and shallow. She opened her eyes wide to monitor the landlord, traced rumors to their source when she heard them, and reported the landlord's illegal activities to the farmers' association.

            Supporting the Peasants' Backbone
    At this time, a very educational event occurred in the land reform process in Xinzhuang Village.
    A rich peasant named Tu Huakun had attended a meeting in the county as a peasant representative during the autumn grain levy. When he returned to the village, he wore a red silk ribbon on his chest and became very arrogant. The peasants hated him very much, especially because he himself was a representative, but he concealed black land and paid less public grain. When the land reform began, he thought he would have a chance to show off again, but the work team first mobilized the poor peasants and farmhands, and then united the middle peasants, ignoring him all along. He began to be jealous, making cold remarks such as "Land reform cannot be done without me," and then even started spreading rumors.
    The peasants, whose class consciousness had been awakened, were of course very angry when they found out. Spreading rumors was sabotaging the land reform, so the poor peasant and farmhand小组 decided to arrest him and send him to the district government. The peasants escorting him solemnly said to the district committee: This guy is sabotaging our emancipation, so we decided to detain him. We are not saying to release him, you must take good care of him for us. The district committee was composed of old cadres who had carried out land reform in Shanxi. He calculated that Xinzhuang Village had just been mobilized for a little over ten days, and the peasants already had such a firm tone of ownership, and felt that the cadres below were working well. He earnestly guaranteed: Of course I will take good care of the bad elements who are sabotaging your emancipation. If you don't say to release him, I will definitely not release him.
    After Tu Huakun was detained in the district government, his family naturally panicked. So, they looked for people to bail him out. They still looked down on the poorly dressed, dirty poor peasants and farmhands, and they specifically looked for those "respectable people," that is, those whose class composition was close to that of landlords and rich peasants. After the bail bond was sent up, the district government said it would examine the qualifications of the guarantors. With this, the guarantors became uneasy. At that time, classes had just begun to be drawn, and the landlords and rich peasants were afraid of exposing their tails of exploiting the peasants, so one by one they retreated.
    Finally, Tu Huakun's family had no choice but to ask the poor peasants and farmhands for help. At first, the poor peasants and farmhands ignored them. Later, everyone met to discuss and put forward three conditions: First, Tu Huakun had to apologize to everyone at a mass meeting when he came back. Second, he guaranteed that he would never spread rumors or do anything to sabotage the land reform in the future. Third, he would make up the public grain that he had concealed during the autumn grain levy and pay it to the government.
    After fulfilling these three conditions, Tu Huakun regained his freedom.
    This incident not only promptly warned all the bad elements who might cause trouble, but also greatly supported the peasants' backbones, making them clearly realize whose side the people's government was on. The realization of the miracle of how honest peasants like Li Aijie, who were short, gaunt, and had never dared to offend even a fly, could point their fingers at the tip of the nose of the landlord Yu Tieshan at the struggle meeting and accuse him sternly after only a few days, was precisely because of the people's government, which was strongly supporting the peasants' backbones.

            No Loopholes, No Deviations
    After the peasants were thoroughly mobilized ideologically, the entire land reform process was easy to carry out. With resolute and indomitable peasants, cunning landlords could neither find loopholes nor escape the net. At the same time, in the struggle, there were plenty of witnesses and material evidence, and there was no need to use any corporal punishment on the landlords. All the handles of the landlord in Xinzhuang Village were in the hands of the peasants, like Li Aijie, who had suffered all their hardships. When drawing classes, the landlord must desperately deny that he is a landlord. He said that he also got up at the fifth watch, and even went to the fields in the rain, how could you say that he didn't work? At this time, the peasants who had worked as farmhands for him could point out: Although he also got up at the fifth watch, he went back to bed after calling the farmhands up. He also went to the fields on rainy days, but he held an umbrella and stood on the ridge supervising the work. The landlord hid black land, but he could not deceive his old tenants. The landlord made hidden walls to hide property, but the handles were in the hands of the carpenters and bricklayers. The various dirty things in the landlord's home could not be hidden from the maids who carried excrement and urine.
    Therefore, the classes in Xinzhuang Village were drawn without major deviations, and the black land was squeezed out completely. In the confiscation stage, a lot of grain and farm tools hidden by the landlords were excavated. Some black-hearted landlords would rather throw things into the pond to spoil them than willingly take them out to distribute to the peasants for production.
    When distributing the fields and fruits, Xinzhuang Village, like all the rural areas where land reform was coming to an end, was full of joy. Li Aijie was happy for the more than three stones of grain and seven dou and eight sheng of land (approximately 5.25 mu) that she received. She planned to use weaving to exchange for labor. It was estimated that the mother and daughter could weave three bolts of cloth a year (fifty zhang each), which would be enough to exchange for a year's field labor. She was even happier that from now on, she would no longer have to jump in fear when she heard dogs barking at night, and Manzi and Liao Zhen would not have to suffer the same sins as she and Hu Yuangui.
    Thinking of this, she didn't know how to thank them enough. Unable to see Chairman Mao, she treated the cadres sent down by Chairman Mao as benefactors. The mother and daughter scrambled to mend the cadres' socks, and turned around and washed the quilts. She had never eaten meat much in her life, but she secretly bought pork with the money she had earned so hard, and bought two pounds! She also bought wine to send off the cadres.
    That day, she solemnly hung a colored portrait of Chairman Mao printed by Xinhua Bookstore on the wall. During the conversation, every time she talked about the good days after emancipation, she would raise her tearful eyes and look at the colored portrait.

            Looking at the Long-Term Prospects from Emancipation
    On the day of the emancipation conference, Manzi and Liao Zhen got up early in the dark. All the peasants in the Hu Tu family also got up. The meeting was to start at two o'clock, but the children had already climbed onto the stage, which was decorated with colorful ribbons and hung with portraits of Chairman Mao, singing "Who Supports Whom" and "The Thousand-Year Iron Tree Blossoms," happier than celebrating ten New Years. On the stage pillars, bright red couplets were pasted, the first line reading "Overturn the Heavens and Earth and Eliminate Feudalism," and the second line reading "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, and Defend the Country." The horizontal inscription was "Peasants of the World are One Family" - the most powerful slogan among the slogans for consolidating the peasant ranks.
    In order to prevent the landlords from poisoning the cattle, some of the cattle were placed in the homes of peasants for foster care during the confiscation. This morning, they were also led out one by one, and someone from the farmers' association directed them to be tied to that tree. The farm tools that had been confiscated were piled up in front of the courtyard: waterwheels, dustpans, and dung buckets. The words "He Dong Hu xx, made in the year of Bingyin" were originally painted on them by the landlord, but the peasants wrote on them in chalk "Thank Chairman Mao" and "Produce well and build a new China." The children beat drums and gongs, and the person in charge of the farmers' association held out several large bundles of red deeds handed over by the landlords - bundles wrapped tightly in cotton paper or silk, with all kinds of cruel conditions written on them. The peasants looked at the pile of deeds of sale from that year with angry eyes, spat on it, and stabbed it hard with spears.
    At the moment of burning the red deeds, the peasants clapped and jumped for joy. Firecrackers crackled and exploded, and the peasants clapped their hands while raising their heads and staring at the black paper ashes rising slowly into the sky, as if they were worried that the paper ashes would fall down and become instruments of enslavement again.
    Li Aijie, standing in the crowd, shed tears. She looked at the paper ashes floating in the clear sky, looked at the fruits she had received, and sighed, "It would have been good if Chairman Mao had come a few years earlier. My Hu Yuangui would definitely have been able to live a few more years and have some good days with the help of Chairman Mao."
    Early the next morning after the emancipation conference, we left Gangkou. My thoughts often returned to Li Aijie. At this time, they were already tilling their own fields. In a few years, when the country's agriculture takes the road of modernization, how happily, diligently, and joyfully will Manzi and Liao Zhen, like thousands upon thousands of emancipated young peasants, drive tractors and cultivate the fertile land of light ochre in Hunan.

### 从李嫒毑的一生看湖南农民的翻身

专栏：

　　从李嫒毑的一生看湖南农民的翻身
    李嫒毑（“嫒毑”是婆婆的意思“毑”音“也”）是岳阳筻口乡新庄村胡涂家的一个矮小、削瘦、只剩了几颗虫蚀牙的老妪。她高枯的颧骨上绉着一滩松皮，眼睛时常淌着泪。实际的年龄是五十三，看起来却老迈得像七十开外的人。解放以前，她经常挎了只篮子，扯着一个八岁的男孩（叫满子），和一个十六岁的女孩（叫了贞），满乡里讨饭，是农村里地主们最嫌弃的人物。
    筻口乡的土地改革是去年十一月底开始的。今年一月二十五日的下午，筻口乡第一农民协会分会在胡涂家屋场前开了翻身大会。五十四天的功夫，李嫒毑，像千千万万被土地改革救活了的农民一样，整个换了一个人。她不但分到了田地，儿子上了小学，已经许给一个痨病人作童养媳的女儿离了婚，并且她自己被旧世界的恶魔们踩碎了骨头的脊背也挺直了起来。
    她的一生，可说是广大中国农民由封建社会的无底深阱奋斗到新民主主义平康大道的一座里程碑。上面镌刻着这段痛苦过程中间农民的种种遭际，也标志着地主阶级、帝国主义和刮民党匪帮狼狈为奸的百般罪行。
            厚厚的一本账
    根据她在诉苦会和斗争会上的发言，我替她略略分析了一下那吃人的旧社会剥削和损害她的厚厚一本账：
    她两岁便死了母亲，父亲是个鞋匠。一个靠手艺吃饭的鳏夫领个孩子当然很吃力，父女两个都混得吃不饱。因此，八岁上，她便被送到人家里做小媳妇（童养媳）去了。婆婆来得个凶，每天要她到塘里挑几担水，纺三两纱，还要种田，喂猪。这样劳作，也短不了挨打受骂。有时候，半夜里还从床上拖下来打。到十五岁结了婚，男的是个不务正业的二流子，成天在街上赌钱。她在地主家里帮工：扫地，做饭，洗十几个人的衣服。二十一岁上，生了个孩子，但是因为没有奶给他吃，孩子不久就饿死了。这时，婆婆对她依然是那么凶，丈夫依然那末游手好闲。在地主家做了六年工，她私下积蓄了一百吊铜钱（每吊五十枚）。她用那一百吊钱赎回了自由，改嫁给胡涂家的一个长工胡元贵。
    “要挣畜牲钱，需跟畜牲眠”，这就形容了他们夫妻俩在地主家里过的日子。吃的是残羹剩饭，住的是牛棚。胡元贵一年四季搓着泥巴。起春就犁田，田里冻起来的泥块把脚板切得皮破血流。六月里车水，车到半夜就倒在水车架子上打盹，八月间收草，一收也是收到深更半夜。一年打上七十多石谷子，他自己不一定赚到十石谷。胡元贵的身子是单薄的。三伏天，当着火盆似的大太阳车水，终于他晕倒了。狼心狗肺的地主连药都没管买一包。
    李嫒毑这个矮小、削瘦的妇人，孩子却生产了不少。她跟她第二个丈夫一共生了十三个孩子，除了她身边的两个以外，还有一个在岳阳驾船，其余十个已经夭折了。孩子们是这样死的：（甲）在反动的统治下，大人没饭吃，自然养不活孩子了。孩子落了地，她的奶头却干瘪瘪的。孩子瘦得皮包着骨头。盖呢，穷得连块包布也没有。从好心肠的街坊借到一捆稻草，一边盖，一边又不能不抽着烧；愈抽愈薄，几天后，孩子还是冻得断了气。（乙）好容易靠沿门讨米养大了一个小子，一个狗吠的夜晚，又给刮民党抓了丁。左近地主富农家里几个小子一崭齐，从来也没抽过丁。单单她这个小子给抓去了。抓去就没回来过。（解放以前，她最怕半夜村里狗咬，一咬她就以为又来抓丁了。）（丙）有几个孩子生了很普通的病，发发烧，泻泻肚，只因为没有钱治，就死了。有一个一直养到了八岁！（丁）她呜咽着承认：第八个孩子是她狠着心在水盆里掐死的。当时她理智地想：与其叫他活上几天再死，不如让他少受几天罪罢。但是事后她哭了好几天，眼睛都哭坏了。那以后，她再也下不去手了。
    胡元贵是个辛勤老实的农民，他们感情极好。在沦陷期间，他被一个当伪保长的地主拉去替日本鬼子干活，活白干，一不顺眼还狠狠挨了一顿棍子。自从那年三伏天在田里晕倒后，他的身子已经更羸弱了。这回他差不多是爬着回的家。一身都给血浸透了。她卖东卖西，替他医治。身上生了脓，嘴里吐着血，伤口上又爬了蛆。终于，一个黄昏，他咽了气。
    夫妻三十来年劳动的结果，置下了小得可怜的一小丘田。为了请大夫，买棺材，她向一个地主借了点谷子。人埋完不久，那个黑心地主又用狮子滚球的利息把她滚个光光净净。从八岁就给人做牛马，四十五年她落下了两间烂草堆成的茅屋，三块砖支成的一座灶，和一个讨饭婆的下场。
            骷髅堆起的宝座
    “乌鸦过身他也要抽一把毛”。李嫒毑用这句生动的话形容剥削她的地主，但是她仅仅形容了地主的贪婪，还没触到他们替反动派拉夫抽丁、吞堤费、霸公田种种卑污残酷的行为。
    距胡涂家李嫒毑那两间茅屋不到两里地，便是新庄村派头最大的地主余铁山的院宅。老远在田埂上便可以望见疏林里一片翘起的高大屋脊，直像一个彪形大汉的肥阔肩膀，压在一簇农民的茅屋上面。新庄舍的大门是可以走八人大轿的，大门两旁都是匠人精心雕成的花纹。土地改革开始后，地主余铁山已经不大敢跨出院门了，里面暂时住进去一些无房的贫农。沿着雕墙画壁晒着一串尿布和破烂衣裤。但是地主当年的威风还不难看出。一进进和天井接起来的庭院都挂了“御赐”或“邑绅拜题”的匾额，上面斗大的颜字，刻着“根深蒂固”一类的词句。祖先牌位上溯直达二十几代，中堂一边放着一座空轿子——象征着地主阶级昨天骑在农民脖子上的威风，一边很洽当地摆着一口棺材。
    由地主用的家具，也可以想象到这个封建剥削阶级当年的优闲豪奢。红地漆金的四柱床上，铺的是虎皮褥子。床里面还有一排放零食和鹿茸、白木耳的小抽屉。枕头上绣着“甜梦”一类的英文字。很少地主不好“风雅”的，线装书外，民国初年石印的艳情小说，时常占地主藏书的大部分。
    所有这些排场，这些“风雅”，都蘸满了长工胡元贵和他那一大堆夭折了的孩子们的血。檐是人骨，瓦是人皮，封建地主的宝座，正是用他们的骷髅堆起的。
            她豁然明白了
    军事上，湖南在一九四九年的秋天便解放了，但李嫒毑，正如中南区千千万万的农民，到去年下半年才喘过第一口气来。减租减息时候，她减回三石谷子，还退回四块光洋的息。更重要的，倒是解放以后，她在农村的地位无形中升高了。她可以帮人采棉花，纺纱了。去年她还给满子和了贞都添了件新衣服。
    土地改革工作队刚到筻口乡的时候，李嫒毑，正如一般受压迫最深久的贫雇农，并不是马上积极起来的。思想上，她还相信着“命里有来定规有，命里无来莫强求”一类历代统治阶级制造出来的宿命论。她一面把地主阶级恨得入骨，一面又担心再来个血淋淋的民国十六年，复辟的地主反过手来砍脑袋。她最初还怕农会不要她这样一个讨饭婆，还以为世界是“体面人”的世界，不是老实人的世界。对于究竟是地主养活农民，还是农民养活地主这个问题，她也是模模糊糊的。有的农民甚至想，毛主席既然打算帮我们农民，为什么不印点子钞票，把地主的田买下来分分呢？
    当时，村里一些中、富农对于土地改革倒显得更积极些，至少是懂得它是怎么一回事。他们老早看到报上登的了。地主的狗腿们更是像泥鳅般钻来钻去。但是土地改革工作队却抓紧了像李嫒毑这样穿得破，家里脏，讲话好象一窍不通的农民，专在他们身上扎根子。干部到李嫒毑家里，帮她干活，同她谈心，终于勾出来她一生的悲惨遭际。她随诉随哭，干部禁不住也哭起来了。
    这时，李嫒毑豁然明白了谁害死她的男人和孩子们，明白了地主不是命里应该睡虎皮褥子的，而是因为胡元贵每年的七十石谷，地主扣下了六十石。
    她又从时事宣传中，懂得刮民党这回是完蛋到底了。他们寒透了中国人民的心，永远也不会回来了。她明白命是抓在穷人自己手里的。不打倒地主阶级，满子、了贞还不会有好日子过。
    想通了后，开什么会，这个矮小、削瘦的老妪都抢先到；夜里有会，就是在外村，她也撑了把火把，深一脚浅一脚地跑去参加。她睁大了眼睛监视着地主，听见谣言就追根，知道了地主的不法行为就报告农会。
            撑起农民的腰板
    这时，新庄村土地改革过程中，发生了一件很富教育意义的事。
    一个叫涂华坤的富农，在秋征时期曾经以农民代表身份去县里开过会，回到村来胸前挂着红绸条，神气十足起来。农民们对他很讨厌，尤其因为他自己当代表，还瞒了黑田，少交了公粮。当土地改革开始时，他蛮以为又有风头可出了，但是工作队首先发动贫雇农，然后团结中农，一直没睬理他。他始而吃醋，放“土地改革没我搞不成”一类的冷箭，继而竟造起谣来。
    阶级觉悟启发了的农民知道后，当然非常震怒。造谣就是破坏土地改革，所以贫雇农小组便决定把他抓起来，送到区政府去。押送的农民郑重对区委说：这家伙破坏我们的翻身，所以我们决定把他扣起来。我们不说放，你们得好好替我们看管着。区委是在山西搞过土地改革的老干部。掐指一算，新庄村刚发动了十几天，农民就有了这么坚定的主人翁的口气，感到下面干部工作得有成绩。他恳切地保证说：破坏你们翻身的坏分子我当然好好看管。你们不说放，我一定不放。
    涂华坤关进区政府去后，他家里自然慌张起来。于是，就找人出来保了。他们眼中依然看不起穿得破，家里脏的贫雇农，他们专找那些“体面人”，也就是成份接近地主富农的。保证书送上去后，区政府说要审查一下保人的资格。这么一说，保人们心虚了起来。那时候阶级刚开始划，地主富农们正怕把自己剥削农民的尾巴露出来呢，于是一个个都撤了腿。
    最后，涂华坤家里没办法了，才向贫雇农们求帮。起先，贫雇农们不理睬，后来大家开会商量，提了三个条件：一、涂华坤回来得在群众大会上向大家道歉。二、保证以后永不造谣，或做任何破坏土地改革的事。三、把秋征时候瞒的公粮，补缴给政府。
    履行了这三个条件后，涂华坤恢复了自由。
    这件事不但及时地警告了所有可能捣乱的坏分子，并且大力地撑起农民的腰，使他们清清楚楚地认识到人民政府是站在谁的立场上。像李嫒毑那样矮小，削瘦，一向苍蝇都不敢得罪的老实农民，十几天以后，在斗争会上也能指了地主余铁山的鼻尖声色俱厉地控诉，这奇迹的实现，正是因为有了大力撑着农民腰板的人民政府。
            没有漏洞没有偏差
    农民从思想上彻底发动起来以后，整个土地改革过程就好搞了。有了坚决不挠的农民，狡滑的地主既钻不了空子，又漏不了网。同时，在斗争中，有的是人证物证，也不需要对地主使用什么肉刑，新庄村地主的一切把柄就全握在像李嫒毑那样吃尽了他们的苦头的农民手里。在划阶级时，地主一定拚命否认他是地主。他说他也起五更，甚至落雨都还下田，怎么说他不劳动？这时给他当过长工的农民就可以指出：虽然他也起五更，但是他把长工喊起来后，自己又钻回被筒去睡了。落雨天他也下田，但是他却撑了把伞，站在田埂上监工。地主瞒黑田，却哄不了他的老佃户。地主作夹墙，隐藏财产，把柄却握在木匠泥水匠的手里。地主家里种种乌七八糟事，却瞒不了端屎倒尿的丫环们。
    因此，新庄村的阶级划得没有大偏差，黑田也挤个一干二净。在征没收阶段，发掘了不少地主隐藏的粮食和农具。黑心的地主，有的宁可把东西丢到塘里去糟践，也不甘心拿出来分给农民来生产。
    分田分果实的时候，新庄村，正如所有土地改革接近尾声的农村，是一片喜气洋洋。李嫒毑为了她分到的三石余粮和七斗八升田（约合五·二五亩）高兴。她打算用织布来换工，估计母女一年织上三个布（每个五十丈），就足够换一年的田间劳动了。她更高兴的是从今以后，夜里听见狗咬心不必再跳，满子和了贞可以不必再受她和胡元贵的那份罪。
    想到这里，她不知道怎样感激好了。见不到毛主席，她就把毛主席派下来的干部当恩人待。母女抢着干部的袜子补，一转身就把被子拆洗了。她一辈子没吃过几次肉，却用自己辛辛苦苦挣来的钱，偷偷买了猪肉，而且买了两斤！还买了酒，替干部饯行。
    那一天，她把干部送给她的一幅新华书店印的毛主席套色像，很郑重地挂在墙上。谈话之间，每说到翻了身的好日子，她便抬起泪水盈眶的眼睛，朝那套色像片望望。
            从翻身看远景
    翻身大会那天，满子和了贞一黑早就爬起来了。整个胡涂家的农民也都爬起来了。会要两点才开，孩子们老早就爬到扎好了彩绸，挂好毛主席像片的台上，一阵唱《谁养活谁》，一阵唱《千年铁树开了花》，真是比过十个年还快乐。台柱上，贴着艳红的对联，上联写着“翻天覆地消灭封建”，下联是“抗美援朝保家卫国”。横批是“天下农民是一家”——巩固农民队伍的口号中间，最有力量的一个口号。
    为了防备地主毒害耕牛，没收的时候，有些耕牛是放在农民家里寄养的，这天早晨，也一头头地牵了出来，农会有人指挥着在那棵树上拴。屋场前面堆满了没收来的农具：水车，撮箕，?桶。地主在上面本来漆着“河东胡××置于丙寅年”的字样，农民在上面用粉笔写上“感谢毛主席”“好好生产，建设新中国”。孩子们敲锣打鼓，农会负责人抱出几大捆地主缴出来的红契——一包包，用棉纸或绸布裹得紧紧的，上面写着种种残酷的条件。农民们用愤怒的目光望着那堆当年的卖身契，向它吐唾沫，用梭标狠狠地扎。
    烧红契的刹那，农民欢喜得又鼓掌又跳脚。爆竹哔拍连响着，农民们一面拍手，一面仰了头，凝视着黑的纸灰袅袅上升天空，真好象担心那纸灰坠下来会又变成为奴役他们的字据。
    站在人群里的李嫒毑淌了泪。她望望晴空飘浮着的纸灰，望望分到的果实，感叹着说：毛主席早来几年就好哒，我的胡元贵定规还可以多活泡把（十来）年，搭帮毛主席过点子好日子。
    翻身大会的第二天清早，我们便离开筻口了。我的思想时常回到李嫒毑的身上。这时候，她们已经在耕着自己的田了。几年以后，国家的农业走上现代化的道路，满子和了贞，正如千千万万翻了身的青年农民，将怎样愉快、勤快、痛快地开着拖拉机，耕耘着湖南淡赭色的肥沃的田地。
