　　Regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on the Price Ratio of Hemp to Grain and Solutions to Problems of Procurement and Supply of Grain and Fertilizer
    In order to reward the planting of hemp for sacks and ensure the interests of hemp farmers, the following regulations are made on the price ratio of hemp to grain and the methods for the procurement of hemp and the supply of grain and fertilizer in hemp-producing areas:
    (1) Hemp-Grain Price Ratio: In East China, each dan of raw yellow hemp can be exchanged for eight dou of rice. In the four provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and Henan, each jin of medium-grade finely washed foreign hemp can be exchanged for three and a half jin of millet, and each jin of medium-grade finely washed green hemp can be exchanged for two and a half jin of millet. The above standards are based on medium-grade hemp. The provinces in Northeast, Central South, and Southwest China shall formulate their own regulations and report them to this Committee for record.
    The above price ratio refers to the actual income of farmers, that is, the selling price of farmers in rural markets and local cooperatives, which shall not be lower than the specified price ratio throughout the year in all seasons.
    (2) Procurement and Supply of Grain and Fertilizer: ① The textile departments shall guarantee the price ratio, actively procure hemp, and widely enter into pre-purchase contracts with hemp farmers through cooperatives. ② The Ministry of Agriculture and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall allocate a portion of the specified fertilizer loans for hemp planting fertilizer loans. If this is not enough, the textile departments shall help solve the problem through pre-purchase methods (including chemical fertilizer loans needed in the Northeast). ③ For areas where hemp production is concentrated, the trade departments shall supply grain and fertilizer in a timely manner.
              Director Chen Yun, March 17

    为奖励种植麻袋用麻、保证麻农利益，特对麻粮比价及麻的收购与产麻地区粮食肥料供应办法作如下规定：
    （一）麻粮比价  华东区黄麻每担生麻换大米八斗，河北、平原、山东、河南四省中等精洗洋麻每斤换小米三斤半，中等精洗青麻每斤换小米二斤半，以上均以中级麻为标准。东北、中南、西南区各省自行规定，并报本委员会备查。
    上述比价系指农民实际所得，亦即农民在乡村市集及当地合作社的出卖价格，全年各季均不能低于所定比价。
    （二）收购及粮食肥料供应  ①由纺织部门保证比价，积极收购，并通过合作社与麻农广泛订立预购合同。②农业部与合作总社应在规定的肥料贷款内指拨一部分为种麻肥料贷款，不敷时由纺织部门以预购方式帮助解决（包括东北需要的化学肥料贷款）。③对麻产集中地区，贸易部门应及时供应粮食肥料。
