　　Demonstration of Popularly Elected District Government
    The People's Representative Conference of the 12th District in the suburbs of Beijing elected the District Head, Deputy District Head, and members of the District Government by a show of hands. This is a demonstration of the first popular election of a District Government in Beijing and a new achievement in the construction of the New Democratic regime.
    As the foundation of the state power of the People's Republic of China, the district and village regimes should be most directly and closely connected with the people, uniting the broad masses to participate in the management of local and national affairs, and "under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, form a strong unified force to fulfill the construction tasks that our people urgently need to fulfill." (Speech by Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi at the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beijing)
    The First Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beijing decided that the people's governments of all districts should implement democratic elections this year. The 12th District of Beijing suburbs has now realized this resolution. Its experience proves that the implementation of popular elections at all levels of people's government "is something we can gradually achieve at present." After we have destroyed the reactionary regime and implemented land reform, the working people who have always been in a position of powerlessness must have their own elected representatives to participate in the government. Just as Sun Delu, a peasant representative from the 12th District of Beijing suburbs who had been a hired laborer for 23 years, said, "When the Kuomintang's district government held meetings, they always invited landlords and gentry. We peasants couldn't even get in the door. Now we can 'take the stage.' We have the right to speak." Our people's government should enable the broad masses of working people who have always been powerless to truly "take the stage" in order to fully exert and consolidate the powerful force of our people's democratic dictatorship system.
    The implementation of such democratic elections in one district immediately increased the people's boundless enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and engaging in production and construction a hundredfold. The railway worker representative's statement that he wanted to carry more things like "a carrying pole" and the peasant representative's statement that he would go "wherever it's busy" are natural expressions of this boundless patriotic enthusiasm.
    All regions with the conditions to implement district elections should take the popular election of the 12th District of Beijing suburbs as an example.

### 民选区政府的示范

　　民选区政府的示范
    北京市郊第十二区各界人民代表会议，以举手表决的方式选出区长、副区长和区政府委员，这是北京市首次民选区政府的一个示范，也是新民主主义政权建设中的一个新成就。
    作为中华人民共和国的国家政权基础的区村政权，应该最直接和最密切地联系人民群众，团结广大人民群众来参加管理地方的事务和国家的事务，“在中央人民政府的统一领导之下，形成为一个强大的统一的力量，去履行我们全国人民迫切需要履行的建设任务。”（刘少奇副主席在北京第三届各界人民代表会议上的讲话）
    北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会决定今年各区人民政府要实行民主选举，京郊十二区现已实现了这项决议。它的经验证明：各级人民政府实行民选，“这是我们在目前就能逐步地达到的”。当我们摧毁了反动的政权、并且实行了土地改革之后，从来处于无权地位的劳动人民就必然要有自己选举的代表参加政府。这正如京郊十二区做过二十三年雇工的农民代表孙德禄所说的，“国民党的区政府开会时，尽是请的地主绅士，我们农民连门槛也进不来。现在我们可‘上台’了。有了发言权了。”我们人民政府就应当使从来无权的广大劳动人民真正“上台”，才能充分发挥与巩固我们人民民主专政制度的强大力量。
    一个区实行了这样的民主选举，立即百倍提高了人民群众对于抗美援朝、镇压反革命和生产建设的无限热忱。铁路工人代表所说的要像“一条扁担”一样地挑更多的东西，农民代表所说的要做到“那儿忙那儿去”，正是这无限的爱国热忱的自然的流露。
    一切有条件实行区选的地区，都应该以京郊第十二区的民选作为榜样。
