Gains from Studying "On Practice"
    Feng Youlan

    In the early Qing Dynasty, the philosopher Yan Xizhai, who emphasized "practice," said something to the effect of: If a teacher tells a student, "Walk south," and the student says nothing, stands up, and walks south, then he is good at learning from the teacher. If the teacher says, "Walk south," and the student also says, "Walk south," but sits there without moving an inch, then he is not good at learning from the teacher, and it can even be said that he has not learned at all.

    "On Practice" discusses the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, but it is not titled "Theory of Knowledge" but "On Practice." This alone indicates that it takes practice as the foundation of knowledge, that knowledge depends on practice, serves practice, and is tested by practice. This is the spirit of "On Practice." To study "On Practice," one must adhere to this spirit and not just study the words of "On Practice." The teacher has already said, "Walk south"; the students should stand up and walk south, not just shout, "Walk south." How to walk? The first step is to connect "On Practice" with one's own practice.

    For the academic world, "On Practice" proposes the only correct method for academic research and also establishes the only correct standard for academic research. Academic workers should use this method and head towards this standard, "walk south," and the first step is to examine their past and correct the direction of their work.

    The People's Daily editorial on January 29th pointed out: "In the intellectual circles of the Chinese bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in modern times, various forms of mysticism and empiricist reactionary trends of thought were prevalent, attempting to build some reactionary philosophies in the ivory tower. These reactionary trends of thought and reactionary philosophies have all been declared bankrupt in the face of the practice of the people's revolution. The republication of Comrade Mao Zedong's 'On Practice' will be of decisive significance in ideologically sweeping away these reactionary philosophical trends of thought or their remnants."

    The People's Daily editorial on February 16th further pointed out: Our academic circles have had and still have two situations. It said: "Comrade Mao Zedong said: 'Only when perceptual material is very rich (not fragmentary and incomplete) and in accordance with reality (not illusions) can correct concepts and theories be created based on such material.' But many of our academic workers actually underestimate or even deny perceptual material, not to mention having 'very rich' perceptual material. Therefore, their 'academic work' has become, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, 'water without a source, a tree without roots.' The result of such so-called 'academic work' can only be pathetic." This is one situation.

    The editorial also said: "Yes, in our academic circles, there are also some people who have engaged in collecting materials on certain issues, and they are indeed very valuable materials. However, these people still only work for the sake of the materials themselves. These people stop their work halfway, and as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, they 'do not know that perceptual material is indeed a reflection of some truth of the objective external world, but it is only one-sided and superficial; this reflection is incomplete and does not reflect the essence of things.' Comrade Mao Zedong said: 'The true task of knowledge lies in reaching thinking through perception, reaching the gradual understanding of the internal contradictions of objective things, understanding their regularity, understanding the internal connection between this process and that process, that is, reaching logical knowledge.' Failing to raise perceptual material to the level of logical knowledge means not engaging in serious research work. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to have truly good results." This is another situation.

    These three paragraphs accurately point out some situations in our academic circles and, in the spirit of "On Practice," reveal the sources of these situations' illnesses.

    In the past, I was one of the people "in the intellectual circles of the Chinese bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie." At that time, I thought I was working very hard, but because I was not standing on the people's standpoint, it was like walking in the wrong direction; the harder I walked, the farther I got from the right path, and the harder it was to turn back. As a result, I was just "attempting to build some reactionary philosophies in the ivory tower." I also conducted a review of my past ideological system once. When I was writing it, I thought it was very thorough, but looking back, it was very incomplete. This has already been criticized by Mr. Mao Mingjia, Mr. Ding Wei, Mr. Du Ping, and Mr. Wang Yao in the Guangming Daily. I take this opportunity to express that I accept their criticisms and express my gratitude to them. Mr. Wang Yao also talked about the direction and path of my future work, believing that I could do some work in the field of Chinese philosophy history. This has given me great encouragement.

    This is precisely the road I want to take. I have written a history of Chinese philosophy, and when it was completed, I also thought it was a considerable contribution to the academic world. Looking at it now, its position and views are all wrong. As a result of studying "On Practice," I have a further understanding of the errors in method. The method I used, although I claimed at the time to be a "scientific" method, was actually the method of bourgeois historians.

    Bourgeois historians believe that history is simply the accumulation of past events; the task of historians is to study what events occurred in the past, and after studying them, write down the results. In this way, one can hope to obtain the "truth" of history. The task of historians is to report these "truths" and not to deduce any theories from the "facts" obtained from research. Because doing so would add subjective elements and would obscure the "truth" of history.

    When I wrote the history of Chinese philosophy in the past, I used this method. I thought that the task of the history of philosophy was to record the "truth" of the thoughts of previous philosophers. In the past, some people had opinions about the universe and life; these opinions were what they were. The task of the history of philosophy was to answer these questions.

    Therefore, the history of philosophy I wrote in the past simply arranged the thoughts of thinkers of various eras, and I also described some of the connections between various thinkers or schools of thought. However, what I described were all ideological connections, that is, only superficial connections. Now I understand that philosophy is the uppermost layer of the superstructure of society. Without excavating its foundation and without conducting class analysis of the thoughts of various philosophers, one cannot understand the "internal contradictions" of the history of philosophy, cannot "understand its regularity," and cannot "understand the internal connection between this process and that process." This means that one cannot obtain the truth of history.

    For example, in the history of philosophy I wrote in the past, when the metaphysics of the Wei and Jin dynasties arose, I said that this was due to the revival of Daoist philosophy. When the Daoist Learning of the Song and Ming dynasties arose, I said that this was due to the revival of Confucianism, plus the influence of Buddhism and Daoism. In the past, I thought that this explained the "internal connection between this process and that process" in the history of Chinese philosophy. Looking at it now, saying this is actually equivalent to saying nothing. What really needs to be explained is why Daoist philosophy revived in the Wei and Jin dynasties, why Confucian philosophy revived in the Song dynasty, what social and historical significance their revival had, and what social changes they reflected. To explain these, it is necessary to find the social background and class roots of these thoughts. Only by finding these roots can one discover the regularity of the development of Chinese philosophy history and can one reach a rational understanding of Chinese philosophy history from a perceptual understanding of Chinese philosophy history.

    If my previous work in the field of Chinese philosophy history has any achievements, it "only collected materials on certain issues," "only worked for the sake of the materials themselves," "stopped the work halfway," and "failed to raise perceptual material to the level of logical knowledge, that is, did not engage in serious research work."

    Bourgeois historians believe that the task of history is only to describe past "facts" and not to criticize and evaluate past "facts," believing that doing so would add subjective elements and would obscure the "truth" of the "facts."

    When I wrote the history of philosophy in the past, I also used this view, believing that the task of the historian of philosophy was to rethink the thoughts of previous philosophers and analyze the logical organization of their systems. In this way, one could obtain the "truth" of their thoughts. If we want to criticize him, we can only say a little about the consistency of his thoughts. If his system is logically self-consistent, he is a first-rate philosopher. Thoughts that cannot withstand this test are the thoughts of second-rate philosophers. I do not agree with saying that a philosopher's thoughts are useful or useless. I often quoted Zhuangzi's words to explain that what one person considers useless, another person may consider to be of "great use."

    The reason I saw it this way was also because I believed that we had no way to determine that a certain philosopher's philosophy was absolutely correct or absolutely incorrect. Because doing so required a standard, and such a standard did not exist. In the past, some people said: "The similarities and differences between Cheng Zhu and Lu Wang are similarities and differences that cannot be combined for eternity, and they are also similarities and differences that cannot be without for eternity." I admired this sentence very much. I believed that philosophy was a kind of learning where "the public says the public has reason, and the婆 says the 婆 has reason." Its spirit is mutual criticism and mutual discussion, and its benefit to people lies in this spirit.

    This view is completely detached from reality, a view that circles exclusively within the realm of "knowledge," completely the view of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. The spirit of mutual criticism and mutual discussion should be promoted. However, there is also a highest and final standard for philosophical theories to determine whether they are wrong or correct, and that is practice.

    History is a matter of the past, but talking about history is a matter of the present; the matter of the present cannot but have an effect and influence on the present. With practice as the standard, we can criticize and evaluate past thoughts. Such criticism and evaluation is the role and contribution that historical workers can play in transforming the world.

    The People's Daily editorial on February 16th pointed out: "In collecting very rich and realistic perceptual material, one will certainly encounter many obstacles and experience great hardship. In 'transforming and manufacturing the rich perceptual material by discarding the crude and selecting the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the outside to the inside, creating a system of concepts and theories,' one will certainly encounter many obstacles and experience even greater hardship." This is the requirement that "On Practice" puts forward to academic workers. These two levels of hardship are great, but compared with the hardship of combat heroes on the battlefield and the hardship of labor heroes in factories, what do these hardships count for?

    The editorial also pointed out: "Our revolutionary experience and historical heritage are extremely rich, this is one aspect. On the other hand, the victory of the people's great revolution and the needs of the construction of the new country have opened up extremely broad 'arenas for heroes' in all aspects of our academic world." It also quoted Engels' words: "'Anyone who is willing to do it seriously can achieve a lot and can stand out.'" This is also what I firmly believe.

    It is truly as the title of the People's Daily editorial on February 16th pointed out, "'On Practice' has opened up the ideological path for our academic revolution." (Reprinted from Guangming Daily)

　　学习《实践论》的收获
    冯友兰
    清朝初年，注重“实践”的哲学家颜习斋说过一段话，大意是：如果先生告诉学生说：“向南方走”，学生一语不发，站起来就向南方走。这样，他就是善于向先生学习。如果先生说：“向南方走”，学生也说，“向南方走”，可是坐在那里一丝不动。这样，他就是不善于向先生学习，也可以说，他简直没有学习。
    《实践论》所谈的是辩证唯物论的认识论，可是它不标题为认识论，而标题为实践论，只这一点，就表示它以实践为认识的根本，认识是依赖于实践的，是为实践服务的，是待实践考验的。这是《实践论》的精神。学习《实践论》必须本着这个精神而不可只在文字上研究《实践论》。先生已经说：“向南方走”了，学生们应该站起来就向南方走，不要只喊：“向南方走”。怎样走呢？第一步就是先把《实践论》与自己的实践联系起来。
    就学术界说，实践论为学术研究提出了一个唯一正确的方法，同时也为学术研究立了一个唯一正确的标准。学术工作者都应该用这个方法，朝着这个标准，“向南方走”，第一步先要检查自己的过去，端正工作的方向。
    一月二十九日人民日报社论，指出：“在近代中国资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想界里面，流行过各种形式的神秘主义和经验主义的反动思潮，企图建筑一些空中楼阁的反动哲学。这类反动思潮和反动哲学都已在人民革命的实践面前，一一地宣告破产了。毛泽东同志的《实践论》的重新发表，对于在思想上扫清这类反动哲学思潮或其残余，将是具有决定性的意义的。”
    二月十六日人民日报社论又指出：我们的学术界过去及现在有两种情形。它说：“毛泽东同志说：‘只有感觉的材料十分丰富（不是零碎不全）与合于实际（不是错觉），才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念与理论来。’但我们许多学术工作者实际上看轻了，以至否定了感觉的材料，更不用说有什么‘十分丰富’的感觉的材料，因此，他们的‘学术工作’也就变成了如毛泽东同志所说的‘无源之水，无本之木’。这样的所谓‘学术工作’，结果当然只能是可悲的。”这是一种情形。
    社论又说：“是的，在我们学术界中，也有些人从事搜集过某些问题的材料，而且是一些很可宝贵的材料。但是，这些人结果还只是为材料而材料。这些人把自己的工作停在半路上，而正如毛泽东同志所指出的，他们‘不知道感觉材料固然是客观外界某些真实性的反映，但它们仅是片面的与表面的东西，这种反映是不完全的，是没有反映事物本质的’。毛泽东同志说：‘认识的真正任务在于经过感觉而达到于思维，到达于逐步了解客观事物的内部矛盾，了解它的规律性，了解这一过程与那一过程间的内部联系，即到达于论理的认识。’没有把感觉材料提高到论理的认识，这就是说，没有认真地从事研究的工作。在这种情况下，要有真正好的成绩，乃是不可能的。”这又是一种情形。
    这三段话确切指出了我们学术界的有些情形，并且本着《实践论》的精神揭发了这些情形的病源。
    在过去我是“中国资产阶级和小资产阶级思想界里面”的一个人。在当时，我自以为是很努力工作的，可是因为没有站在人民的立场，好象走路错了方向，越努力走，离正路越远，越不容易转回来，结果，只是“企图建筑一些空中楼阁的反动哲学”。我也曾经对于我过去的思想系统，作过一回检讨。在写的时候，自己觉得是很彻底，后来看，是很不彻底。这已经有茅冥家，丁未一，杜平，王瑶诸先生在光明日报上批评过。我借这个机会，表示我接受他们的批评，并向他们诸位表示感谢。王瑶先生并且谈到我将来工作的方向与途径，认为我可以在中国哲学史方面，作一点工作。这予我以很大的鼓励。
    这正是我所要走的路，我写过一部中国哲学史，在写成的时候，也自以为是在学术界有相当的贡献。在现在看，它的立场与观点，都是错误的。学习《实践论》的结果，对于方法上的错误有进一步的认识。我所用的方法，虽当时自命为是“科学的”方法，但实在是资产阶级历史学的方法。
    资产阶级历史家认为历史就是过去事情的堆积；历史家的任务，就在于研究过去究竟有些什么事情，研究以后，把所得的结果写出来。这样就可以希望得到历史的“真相”。历史家的任务，就在于报告这些“真相”，而不在于从研究所得的“事实”中，推出什么理论。因为这样作，就要加入主观的成份，就会蒙蔽历史的“真相”。
    我以前写中国哲学史的时候，就是用这样的方法。我以为哲学史的任务，就是在于把以前的哲学家的思想的“真相”纪载下来。以前就有些什么人对于宇宙人生有过意见，这些意见，就是什么。哲学史的任务，就在回答这些问题。
    因此我以前所写的哲学史，只是把各时代的思想家的思想，排列起来，各思想家或各思想派别中间的联系，也叙述了一些。可是所叙述的都是思想上的联系，也就只是表面上的联系。现在我了解，哲学是社会的上层建筑的最上层，不发掘到它的基础，不对于各哲学家的思想，作阶级分析，就不能了解哲学史的《内部矛盾》，不能“了解它的规律性”，不能“了解这一过程与那一过程间的内部联系”。这也就是说，不能得到历史的真相。
    例如在我以前所写的哲学史中，魏晋玄学发生了，我说这是由于道家哲学的复兴。宋明道学发生了，我说这是由于儒家的复兴，加上了佛家与道家的影响。以前以为这样就说明了中国哲学史的“这一过程与那一过程间的内部联系”。现在看，这样说实在等于没有说什么。真需要说明的是道家哲学为什么在魏晋时代复兴，儒家哲学为什么在宋朝复兴，它们的复兴有什么社会的与历史的意义，是什么社会变化的反映。要说明这些，就需要找出这些思想的社会的背景、阶级的根源。必须找出这根源，才能发现中国哲学史发展的规律性，才能从对于中国哲学史的感性认识达到对于中国哲学史的理性认识。
    我以前在中国哲学史方面的工作，如果还有一点成绩的话，也“只是搜集过某些问题的材料”，“只是为材料而材料”，“把自己的工作，停在半路上”，“没有把感觉材料提高到论理的认识，这就是，没有认真地从事研究的工作”。
    资产阶级历史家，以为历史学的任务，只在于叙述过去的“事实”，不在于对于过去的“事实”作批判与估价，以为这样作便是加入主观的成份，便会蒙蔽“事实”的“真相”。
    我以前写哲学史，也用这个看法，以为哲学史家的任务，就是把以前哲学家的思想重想一遍，分析它的系统的逻辑的组织，这样就可以得到他的思想的“真相”。如果我们要批评他，我们只可以就他的思想的一致性上，说一点话。如果他的系统在逻辑上自相一致的，他就是一个第一流的哲学家。经不起这个考验的思想，是第二流哲学家的思想。我不赞成说那个哲学家的思想是有用的或无用的。我常引庄子的话，说明一个人认为是无用的东西，另一个人可以认为是有“大用”的。
    我这样看，也是由于我认为，我们没有办法来确定某一家的哲学是绝对正确的，或绝对不正确的。因为那样作需要一个标准，而这样的标准是不存在的。从前有人说：“程朱陆王之同异，乃千古不可合之同异，亦千古不可无之同异”。我很欣赏这一句话。我认为哲学就是“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”的一种学问。它的精神就是互相批评与互相讨论；它对于人的好处，也就在于它有这种精神。
    这种看法，完全是脱离实际，专在“知”的范围内打圈子的看法，完全是资产阶级及小资产阶级的知识分子的看法。互相批评与互相讨论的精神是应该提倡的。但是对于哲学的理论，也有一个最高的与最后的标准，以决定其是错误或正确，那就是实践。
    历史是过去的事，但讲历史是现在的事；现在的事对于现在，不能不发生作用与影响。有了实践以为标准，我们就可以对于过去的思想，作批评与估价。这样的批评与估价，就是历史工作者对于改造世界所能起的作用，所能有的贡献。
    二月十六日人民日报社论指出说：“在搜集十分丰富和合于实际的感觉材料的时候，这当然是要遇到许多险阻，并经历一番极大的劳苦。在‘将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗去精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念及理论的系统’的时候，这当然又是要遇到许多险阻，并经历一番更大的劳苦。”这是《实践论》向学术工作者所提出的要求。这两层的劳苦，是大的，但是比起战斗英雄在战场上的劳苦，比起劳动英雄在工场里的劳苦，这些劳苦又算什么呢？
    社论又指出：“我们的革命经验及历史遗产都是极端丰富的，这是一方面。另一方面，人民大革命的胜利和新国家建设的需要，则给我们各方面的学术界开辟了极其广大的‘英雄用武之地’。”它又引恩格斯的话说：“‘谁只要肯认真地去做，就可以有很多成就，就能够出人头地。’”这也是我所深信不疑的。
    真是如二月十六日人民日报社论的标题所指出的，“《实践论》开辟了我们学术革命的思想道路。”（转载光明日报）
