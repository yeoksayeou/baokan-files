Farmers in Xuchang County, Henan Province, are actively carrying out preparations for planting tobacco, planning to greatly restore the area of land used for tobacco cultivation this year. This county is a well-known tobacco-producing area. At its peak, tobacco farmers accounted for more than 80% of the total number of farm households, and the tobacco planting area reached about 23% of the county's total cultivated land. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to the cruel exploitation and oppression by the Kuomintang reactionary government and landlords, especially the economic aggression of American imperialism, tobacco farmers suffered severe devastation. Many people were forced to flee or even starved to death due to losses from tobacco cultivation. After liberation, many farmers still had concerns about planting tobacco because they did not understand the people's government's policy of developing special crop production and were afraid to plant boldly. In addition, the sales problem of tobacco leaves was not resolved in the early days of liberation, and local work cadres did not pay enough attention to tobacco leaf production. Currently, the area of land used for tobacco cultivation in the county is still very small. According to last year's statistics, the tobacco planting area accounted for only 2% of the total land area, equivalent to one-tenth of the tobacco planting area before the War of Resistance Against Japan.

In order to expand this year's tobacco planting area, the county people's government successively held tobacco farmer symposiums, district chief joint meetings, etc., to specifically study various issues related to tobacco planting. After the meetings, in-depth publicity was carried out in various places. The call to expand the tobacco planting area received a warm response from the vast number of farmers. For example, Zhang Genfa, a cadre of Huzhai Township in the Fourth District, said: "Last year, the government called for tobacco planting, and those of us who didn't plant suffered a loss. People who planted tobacco could earn as much from one mu of tobacco as from four mu of grain. This year, we must believe in the government's words and plant more tobacco leaves." Currently, farmers in various districts have successively formulated tobacco planting plans. Farmers in Yangtang Township in the Seventh District have reported that the number of tobacco planting land has reached 40% of the township's total land. In some places, farmers are challenging each other to see who can plant more tobacco leaves. For example, cadres from eight townships in the Heshangji sub-district are challenging each other, with eight households planning to plant a total of 36 mu of tobacco. This year, the county plans to plant a total of 200,500 mu of tobacco, accounting for approximately 19.2% of the county's cultivated land area. This is nearly ten times the expansion of the tobacco planting area compared to last year, which will catch up with the pre-war level. According to the current market price of tobacco leaves, 200,500 mu of tobacco is equivalent to more than 800,000 mu of grain land, which can be converted into 160 million jin of grain at a yield of 200 jin per mu. Currently, farmers in various places are starting to soak tobacco seeds and preparing to raise seedlings early. Tobacco farmers in the Fourth District are also studying the method of collective seedling raising to solve the problem of tobacco seed shortages.

　　河南许昌农民
    积极恢复烟田面积
    计划今年接近战前水平
    河南许昌县农民积极开展种烟的准备工作，计划在今年大量恢复种烟的土地面积。该县是著名的产烟区，最盛时全县烟农约占农民总户数的百分之八十以上，种烟面积曾达全县耕地总面积百分之二十三左右。但在国民党反动统治时期，因国民党反动政府及地主的残酷剥削压榨，特别是美帝国主义的经济侵略，使烟农遭受到严重摧残，因种烟损失而被迫逃亡甚至饿死的人很多。解放以后，仍然有不少农民，因为对人民政府发展特种作物的生产政策不了解，对种烟仍存在着顾虑，不敢大胆种植。加以解放初期烟叶销路问题未解决及地方工作干部对烟叶生产注意不够，现该县种烟的土地面积仍然很小。据去年统计，全县种烟面积只占总土地面积的百分之二，相当于抗日战争以前种烟面积的十分之一。
    为了扩大今年的烟叶栽种面积，该县人民政府曾先后召开了烟农座谈会、区长联席会等，专门研究关于种烟的各种问题，会后各地又进行了深入的宣传。扩大种烟面积的号召，获得了广大农民的热烈响应。如四区胡寨乡干部张根发说：“去年政府号召种烟，我们没种的吃了亏，人家种了的一亩烟能顶四亩粮，今年一定要相信政府的话，多种烟叶。”现各区农民已纷纷订出种烟的计划，七区杨堂乡农民自报种烟土地数目已达全乡土地的百分之四十。有的地方农民互相挑战，比赛多种烟叶，如和尚集小区八个乡干部互相挑战，八户共计划种烟三十六亩。今年全县计划共种烟二十万零五千亩，约占全县耕地面积的百分之十九点二。比去年扩大种烟面积将近十倍，将赶上战前水平。如按现在烟叶的市价计算，二十万零五千亩烟叶，约等于八十多万亩地的粮食，以每亩地产粮二百斤计，可折合一亿六千万斤粮食。现在各地农民正着手泡烟种，准备早育苗，四区烟农并正在研究用集体育苗的办法，以解决烟种的困难问题。
