Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 13th: The Chinese exhibits, participating for the first time in the eight-hundred-year-old German Leipzig International Spring Fair, have received special attention and welcome from visitors. As soon as the fair opened, the Chinese exhibition hall was crowded with people. Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht, Trade Minister Georg Handke, and the recently returned head of the diplomatic mission to China, Johannes König, all visited. Ji Pengfei, head of our diplomatic mission to the German Democratic Republic, and Jia Shi, head of our delegation to the fair, visited the Chinese exhibition hall to provide detailed explanations to the distinguished guests. On the 6th, Head of Delegation Jia Shi held a press conference, addressing 150 journalists from Germany and other countries, expounding on China's economic and trade policies and the principles of foreign trade.

The Chinese exhibition hall is located in the center of the 10th exhibition hall, specially designated for the people's democratic countries at the fair, covering an area of 1,500 square meters, the largest of the exhibition halls. Inside the exhibition hall, the rear wall is dominated by a huge photograph of Tiananmen Square, 18 feet high and 72 feet wide, fully demonstrating the great spirit of the People's Republic of China. The walls on both sides are filled with photographs introducing the construction of the new China in various fields over the past year. Photographs of Chairman Mao reviewing the troops and the masses during the founding ceremony, of Chinese workers and peasants actively engaged in production and construction and showing their liberated lives, and of the peace signature campaign and the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement throughout China attracted great attention from the audience.

The characteristics of the Chinese exhibits are: they demonstrate China's vast territory and abundant resources, the diligence and wisdom of the Chinese people, and that China is a powerful force defending peace. In the agricultural section, we have top-quality tea, soybeans, rice, peanuts, tobacco, medicinal materials, as well as special products such as bristles, oils, eggs, furs, and casings. In the industrial and mining section, we have abundant reserves of tungsten, antimony, tin, and high-quality mica and asbestos, and valuable uranium. The precisely manufactured ball bearings and other instruments in the exhibits illustrate to the audience that Chinese industry, which has been ravaged and oppressed by imperialism for a century, has greatly developed and reached previously unattainable levels after liberation. Various textiles, handicrafts, and specialty handicrafts are particularly admired by the audience. They demonstrate the amazing creativity of the Chinese working people and the unique style and historical tradition of Chinese national art.

People from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic attach great importance to China's participation in the fair. Newspapers in Berlin and Leipzig and the fair's special editions have introduced the situation of the Chinese exhibition hall in prominent positions. Neues Deutschland pointed out: "What is of particular interest to visitors from the East and the West are the exhibits of the People's Republic of China, which vividly demonstrate China's huge natural resources and the diligence of Chinese workers and peasants." Georg Handke, Minister of Trade of the German Democratic Republic, specifically pointed out in his opening speech at the fair: The participation of the new China in the fair will promote trade relations between China and the German Democratic Republic and all of Germany. The Berlin Daily's special edition of the fair wrote: The Chinese exhibition hall enables visitors to fully recognize the possibility of China providing a wide range of export goods, making the international nature of the Leipzig Fair perfect. Hans Jendretzky, Minister of Machine Industry of the German Democratic Republic, wrote in the Berlin Daily Review on the 4th: The working people of the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to implement the Sino-German trade agreement and transport high-quality machinery and materials to China.

The strength of the new China demonstrated by the Chinese exhibits has greatly encouraged the working people of the German Democratic Republic. A farmer in the suburbs of Leipzig said: "In the past, we knew too little about China. Now that we have seen the Chinese exhibition in person, we will never be afraid of American imperialism again!" Workers who came to visit said that after seeing the exhibition, it further increased their confidence in completing the new five-year plan, because they saw that in their struggle for the unification, peace, and democracy of all of Germany, they have a strong and resource-rich friend.

　　在莱比锡博览会上我国展览品受欢迎
    皮克、乌布利希等均亲临参观
    【新华社莱比锡十三日电】在具有八百年传统的德国莱比锡国际春季博览会中，首次参加博览会的我国展览品，受到了观众特别的重视和欢迎。博览会刚一开幕，中国展览室中便挤满了人，德意志民主共和国总统皮克、副总理乌布利希、贸易部长韩克和最近返国的驻华外交使团团长柯尼希等均曾亲临参观。我驻德意志民主共和国外交使团团长姬鹏飞和我出席博览会代表团团长贾石等都曾到中国展览室，为贵宾们详细讲解。贾石团长并于六日举行了记者招待会，向德国和其他国家的一百五十位记者发表谈话，阐述了我国的经济和贸易政策及对外贸易的原则。
    中国展览室设在博览会中特为各人民民主国家辟设的第十展览馆中央，占地一千五百平方公尺，是展览室中最大的一间。展览室内，正中后墙上是一幅高一丈八尺、宽七丈二尺的天安门巨照，充分表现了中华人民共和国的伟大气魄。两旁墙上挂满了介绍新中国一年多以来各方面建设情形的照片。开国典礼时毛主席检阅部队和群众的照片，新中国工人和农民积极地从事生产建设和表现出他们翻身后生活的照片，以及全中国各地展开和平签名运动和抗美援朝爱国运动的照片吸引了观众极大的注意。
    中国的展览品的特色是：它们表现了中国的地大物博，表现了中国人民的勤劳和智慧，表现了中国是保卫和平的强大力量。在农业部分中，我们有上等的茶叶、大豆、稻米、花生、烟草、药材以及猪鬃、油脂、蛋品、皮毛、肠衣等等的特产。在工矿部分中，我们有蕴藏丰富的钨、锑、锡，有品质优良的云母、石棉，有名贵的铀。展览品中，制作精确的球轴承和其他仪器向观众说明了：百年以来，被帝国主义所摧残压迫的中国工业，在解放之后，已有很大的发展，达到了以前所不能达到的水平。各种纺织品、手工业产品和特种手工艺品是观众特别赞叹的。它们表现了中国劳动人民的惊人的创造性和中国民族艺术独具的风格和历史传统。
    德意志民主共和国各方面人士都非常重视中国参加博览会。柏林和莱比锡的报纸以及博览会的特刊都以显著的地位介绍了关于中国展览室的情形。新德意志报指出：“特别使从东方和西方来的观众感到兴趣的是中华人民共和国的展览品，它生动地证明了中国巨大的天然富源和中国工人与农民的勤劳。”德意志民主共和国贸易部部长韩克在博览会开幕词中，特别指出：新中国的参加博览会将促进中国与德意志民主共和国和全德国的贸易关系。柏林日报的博览会特刊写道：中国展览室使参观者能够充分地认识到中国提供多方面出口货的可能性，使莱比锡博览会的国际性质达到了完美的地步。德意志民主共和国机器工业部部长齐勒四日在柏林每日评论报撰文称：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民将尽一切力量来实现中德贸易协定，将品质优良的机器和物资运到中国去。
    从中国展览品中所表现出来的新中国的力量大大鼓舞了德意志民主共和国的劳动人民。莱比锡郊区的一个农民说：“过去我们对中国知道得太少了，现在，我们亲自看到了中国的展览，绝不会再害怕美国帝国主义了！”来参观的工人们说，看过展览后，更加提高了他们完成新五年计划的信心，因为他们看到，他们在为争取全德的统一、和平和民主所作的斗争中，有强大而且资源丰富的朋友。
