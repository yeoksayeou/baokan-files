Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The national large-scale spring water conservancy project is about to begin. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government today issued "Instructions on the 1951 Spring Water Conservancy Project," with the following key points:

(1) Regarding the leadership structure for the spring repair project: Last year, most regions primarily relied on local administrative organs, in coordination with water conservancy authorities and related units, to jointly establish leadership structures. This played a significant role in the successful completion of last year's spring repair project. This year, it is necessary to continue strengthening organizational, administrative, and technical coordination. Water conservancy authorities must, in particular, develop detailed construction plans early and fully exchange opinions with administrative organs to achieve unity in leadership thinking. After the project begins, efforts should be made to ensure the enthusiasm of the laborers and the successful completion of the project. Administrative and technical cadres must cooperate closely.

(2) Regarding the mobilization of laborers: When mobilizing laborers, the differences between disaster areas and non-disaster areas should be taken into consideration. In non-disaster areas, it is first necessary to overcome the masses' complacency regarding water and drought disasters and explain that water conservancy projects and spring plowing and sowing are consistent in increasing production. At the same time, mutual aid organizations for spring plowing and spring repair must be firmly established to alleviate the laborers' concerns. The number of laborers to be mobilized should be determined based on specific conditions such as the needs of the project, the distance of the region, the size of the construction site, and the number of tools. In disaster areas, to implement work-for-relief programs, labor force requirements should not be overly strict, but the elderly, the sick, pregnant women, and children should be dissuaded from participating to prevent accidents.

(3) Regarding project preparation: In terms of project preparation, the first thing to pay attention to is planning. All project plans must be approved by a certain higher-level authority before construction can begin to avoid errors in planning and design that could cause losses. Secondly, there should be a comprehensive construction plan for the implementation of the project to prevent waste. Before construction begins, all kinds of technical preparations should be made. Sufficient preparations should be made for the supply of firewood and grain, the accommodation and meals of the laborers, and medical and health work to truly protect the health of the laborers.

(4) Regarding construction leadership, laborer organization, and wages: The central requirement for construction leadership is to improve work efficiency, ensure project quality, and prevent waste. When dealing with laborer wages, engineering leadership at all levels must, on the one hand, conduct patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the laborers to inspire their consciousness and willingness; at the same time, different wages must be set according to conditions such as soil quality and transport distance; it is essential to achieve timely measurement, grain distribution, no arrears in laborer wages, and a guaranteed system of payment according to measurement. The organization of laborers should be based on free combination, and a scoring and work-recording system should be implemented to carry out the principle of "more work, more pay." In managing laborers, it is necessary to fully develop the spirit of democracy, pay attention to discovering and cultivating various typical model groups, and promote the improvement of tools and working methods to drive the efficiency of the general laborers. Overwork of individual laborers must be prevented. While improving work efficiency, attention must also be paid to mastering project quality and project standards.

(5) To strengthen inspection work, we should take a comprehensive view, conduct on-site inspections of project planning, design, and economic benefits to improve them in a timely manner and reduce losses.

　　全国大规模水利春修工程即将开始 
   水利部指示及早订出施工计划
    并号召在组织上、行政和技术的配合上继续加强
    【新华社十五日讯】全国巨大规模的水利春修工程即将开始，中央人民政府水利部今日特发布“关于一九五一年水利春修工程的指示”，指示要点如下：
    （一）关于春修工程的领导机构问题：去年多数地区以地方行政机关为主，协同水利主管机关及有关单位，共同建立领导机构，对于去年春修工程的胜利完成起了很大的作用。今年需要在组织上、行政和技术的配合上继续加强。水利主管机关尤须提早做出周密的施工计划，并与行政机关充分交换意见，以取得领导思想的一致。工程开始以后，应保证民工工作情绪的饱满和工程的胜利完成；行政与技术干部尤须密切配合。
    （二）关于民工的动员问题：动员民工时应照顾到灾区与非灾区的区别。在非灾区，要首先克服群众对水、旱灾害的麻痹思想，并说明水利工程与春耕播种，在增加生产上是一致的。同时，要确实建立春耕与春修的互助组织，以解除民工的顾虑。关于动员民工数量的多寡，应根据工程的需要、地区的远近、工地的广狭与工具的数量等具体条件决定。在灾区为施行以工代赈，劳动力不能过分要求整齐，但须劝阻老人、病人、孕妇及儿童参加，以防意外。
    （三）关于工程的准备问题：在工程准备方面，首先要注意计划性，所有工程计划，必须经过一定的上级机关批准方可开工，以免在规划设计上发生错误，造成损失。其次，对工程的实施也要有通盘的施工计划，以防浪费。开工前，应做好各种技术准备工作。柴粮的供应，民工的食宿以及医疗卫生等工作，都应有充分的准备，以确实维护民工的健康。
    （四）关于施工的领导、民工的编组及工资等问题：关于施工的领导问题，以提高工作效率，保证工程质量，和防止浪费为中心要求。各级工程领导机关在处理民工工资问题时，一方面要对民工进行抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，以启发其自觉自愿；同时必须根据土质、运距等条件，规定不同的工资；要切实做到及时收方、发粮、不拖欠民工工资，和保证按方给资的制度。民工的编组，应是自由结合方式，并实行评分记工，贯彻“多做多得”的方针。在管理民工方面，要充分发挥民主精神，注意发现并培养各种典型的模范小组；提倡改良工具和工作方法，以带动一般民工效率的提高。要防止个别民工的过度劳动。提高工作效率，要同时注意到工程质量和工程标准的掌握。
    （五）要加强检查工作，应从全面着眼，实地考察工程的规划设计与经济效益，以求及时改善，减少损失。
