Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18th: L'Humanité published a joint statement by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain and the Secretariat of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. The statement pays warm tribute to the heroic struggle of the working people of Barcelona and emphasizes that the Spanish people must end Franco's dictatorial rule in the near future.

The statement points out that the Spanish people are determined to fight against the imperialist war preparations. They know that the current aggravation of hunger and poverty is the immediate consequence of such war preparations. The statement said: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain and the Secretariat of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia would like to reiterate the call made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party in December 1950 to all workers, Republican parties and groups, and all democratic patriotic forces to establish a Republican Democratic National Front. The establishment of this front will enable the Spanish people to win a more rapid victory in their struggle against Franco's rule and war.

The Communist Party of Spain and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia call on all workers and the entire people to maintain and strengthen the unity formed in the struggle to meet future battles, which will inevitably develop in Barcelona and throughout Spain, and finally satisfy the demands made, bring down the Franco regime, and establish a democratic and peaceful regime in Spain.

The statement calls on the Spanish people to support the imprisoned and persecuted striking workers and to help them materially.

The statement concludes: "The Communist Party of Spain and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia are particularly excited to note the extraordinary proletarian international solidarity aroused by the struggle in Barcelona among the working people of the world, especially in France and Italy." The statement pointed out that this solidarity proves that: although the American-controlled majority in the United Nations shelters the Franco regime, "the people of capitalist countries, like the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, support the Spanish people's struggle for liberation."

　　西班牙共产党中央委员会等
    向巴塞罗那劳动人民致敬
    号召人民加强斗争结束佛朗哥专制统治
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：人道报发表西班牙共产党中央委员会与加泰罗尼亚统一社会党书记处的联合声明。声明向巴塞罗那劳动人民的英勇斗争致热烈的敬礼，并强调指出西班牙人民必须在不久的将来结束佛朗哥的专制统治。
    声明指出：西班牙人民已决意进行斗争，反对准备帝国主义的战争。他们知道，目前饥饿与贫困的加剧，就是这种战争准备的立即的后果。声明说：西班牙共产党中央委员会与加泰罗尼亚统一社会党书记处还要再一次重申共产党中央委员会在一九五○年十二月向所有工人、各共和党派与团体，向所有民主爱国力量所发出的号召，即：成立共和民主民族战线，这个战线的成立，会使西班牙人民为反对佛朗哥统治与战争而进行的斗争更迅速地取得胜利。
    西班牙共产党和加泰罗尼亚统一社会党号召所有劳动者和全体人民保持与加强在斗争中所形成的团结，以迎接将来的战斗，这种战斗必然会在巴塞罗那和西班牙全国发展起来，而终于使提出的各种要求得到满足，使佛朗哥政权垮台，并在西班牙建立一个民主和平的政权。
    声明号召西班牙人民支援被囚禁被迫害的罢工工人，并从物质上帮助他们。
    声明在结语中说：“西班牙共产党和加泰罗尼亚统一社会党特别兴奋地注视着巴塞罗那的斗争在全世界、特别是在法国和意大利劳动人民中间所引起的异乎寻常的无产阶级的国际团结。”声明指出：这种团结证明了：尽管联合国中美国所控制的多数庇护佛朗哥政权，然而，“各资本主义国家的人民也和伟大的苏联和人民民主国家一样，是支持西班牙人民的解放斗争的”。
