Working Report of the Department of Agriculture of Shanxi Provincial People's Government

This year's agricultural technology improvement work focuses on the promotion of improved varieties, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, and farm construction. The work situation of the past year is described as follows:

        I. Promotion of Improved Varieties

According to statistics from 54 counties, 592,937 mu of improved varieties were promoted in spring sowing, exceeding the original task by 13.43%. According to some materials that are already known, the yield generally increased by 10% to 20%. For example, the average yield of Jin Queen corn increased by 30%. Li Shunda's Jin Queen corn yielded more than 900 catties, more than double the local varieties. Summer seed selection has attracted the attention of leaders at all levels. According to statistics from 62 counties, a total of 18,945,253 catties of wheat were selected and sown on 2.1 million mu of land during autumn sowing. Autumn seed selection was a further step deeper than summer selection. In some model labor villages and some old areas with a good working foundation, field visits and field selections were mostly carried out. According to existing materials, field selection in some advanced villages reached about 50%, and single harvesting, single threshing, and single storage were achieved. A few villages also tried corn alternate-row detasseling for seed selection. According to incomplete statistics from 30 counties, the autumn selection reached 7.45 million catties, which can be sown on 2.8 million mu. In the summer and autumn seed selection, not only the scientific knowledge of the masses was improved, but also many seed selection experts emerged. The most prominent is Wei Maohai from Lingchuan. He used the method of "on-site evaluation, retaining the superior, and eliminating the inferior" to evaluate the two or three kinds of millet in his village, retained three kinds after the evaluation, and eliminated all the rest, and paid attention to management to maintain various strains. This laid a good foundation for variety improvement. At the same time, through the seed selection movement, some cadres and the masses realized that seed selection is a powerful method of increasing production with less money and greater results, thus laying a certain foundation for increasing production in 1951. However, there are still many shortcomings, even serious mistakes, in the selection and promotion of improved varieties. First of all, the "method of on-site evaluation, retaining the superior, and eliminating the inferior" and the "policy of on-site evaluation, organizing mutual exchange and adjustment" are not clear enough, so the guidance is not specific and appears weak, and even in some places, the introduction of foreign varieties and the vigorous purchase of improved seeds are overemphasized. As a result, due to lack of experience and weak organizational strength, many problems occurred, and the state funds suffered losses. For example, some of the 811 millet seeds purchased from Shandada Farm were not only not full, but also mixed with sand and soil, so the masses were unwilling to accept them. Another example is that Fenyang Special Zone purchased and transferred 440,000 catties of cottonseeds, which were distributed to Yuci Special Zone and Jinyuan, Qingyuan, Zhongyang, Jiaocheng and other counties, and all resulted in significant problems, and the accounts have not yet been settled. In Yuncheng Special Zone, some of the wheat seeds purchased could not be promoted. Of course, it is right to plan to introduce foreign improved varieties and appropriately purchase local improved varieties for adjustment and reproduction, but due to excessive emphasis, even blind purchase and adjustment, irreparable losses have been caused (the overall specific situation is being clarified). Secondly, the promotion of improved varieties is not sufficiently combined with the promotion of cultivation techniques. For example, when Fenyang Special Zone promoted 4-198 sorghum, it did not introduce the cultivation methods to the masses, resulting in more than 2,000 mu of 4-198 sorghum yielding less than the local varieties, and some even did not mature at all. In addition to compensating for the loss of 10,000 catties of rice, the masses were very dissatisfied, which created difficulties for future promotion. There are also cases of blindly promoting without paying attention to the characteristics and adaptability of crops. For example, Xiaoyi County planted No. 169 wheat in low-lying areas, and as a result, the masses called it "one dou nine." Furthermore, the seed selection and promotion were not timely enough. For example, the technical guidance in the summer selection did not catch up with the season. When the promotion team went to Linfen to provide guidance, the harvest had already begun, and Yuncheng Special Zone had already harvested half of the wheat, losing the timeliness of promoting field selection. Even worse, the seeds were transported after the season had passed, resulting in wasted efforts. Finally, as far as the whole province is concerned, the seed selection work has not been carried out widely and deeply enough. Not only have many areas (the specific situation has not been clarified) not started this work, but also in the areas that have already started, due to the lack of technology and the lack of in-depth work, it has fallen into formalism, and even in a few areas, it has played a "troublesome" role.

        II. Occurrence of Diseases and Insect Pests and Prevention and Control Work

According to incomplete statistics from 3,994 villages in 78 counties in 7 special zones, the area affected by diseases and insect pests was 1.3 million mu, and 300,000 fruit trees were affected. In terms of diseases, according to incomplete statistics from 51 counties (12 complete counties) in Linfen and Xin County, wheat stripe rust, millet head smut, wheat, millet, corn, and sorghum black smut reached 1 million mu, of which wheat stripe rust alone accounted for 700,000 mu, with an average yield reduction of 15%. Millet head smut affected 860,000 mu in 24 counties, with an average yield reduction of 11%. In terms of insect pests, 30 kinds of pests such as aphids, mole crickets, locusts, 28-spotted ladybugs, millet borers, and pear leaf rollers occurred in 2,971 villages in 78 counties, damaging 3 million mu of crops such as wheat, millet, and Chinese yam, and 300,000 pear and jujube trees. Among them, cotton aphids affected 1.34 million mu in 59 counties, accounting for 60% of the total cotton field area. Underground pests affected 910,000 mu in 40 counties. 28-spotted ladybugs affected 370,000 mu of Chinese yam in 1,069 villages in 21 counties. Other pests such as millet borers and grubworms were also very serious.

In terms of disease and insect pest prevention and control: our policy is to prevent rather than cure, and to attach equal importance to promoting mass experience and scientific technology. In the spring, 960,000 mu of seed disinfection were promoted in 909 villages in 43 counties including Jincheng, accounting for 79% of the sowing area in each of these areas. Xing and Xin two special zones used 270,000 catties of wine for disinfection, and Huguan used 1,900 catties of asphalt. Cotton areas have always had the habit of seed soaking. In some areas of Dai County, Qin County, and Wutai, disinfection reached 40%, and in the new area of Yangqu, disinfection reached 20%. This autumn and winter wheat disinfection, according to Yangqu, Qi County, Xiangyuan, Hongdong, Taigu, Yuci and other counties, the disinfection area accounts for 47% of the sowing area. From the inspection of seed disinfection effect, according to Xu Xinhai, Xu Jingming, and Zhao Wuying, three households in Guozhuang Village, Er District, Tunliu, their wheat was not infected after soaking in warm water, and each mu yielded four or five dou. Zhao Chouhai did not soak the seeds, and black smut reached 75%. Five mu of wheat land only yielded seven dou. Li Baocheng did not soak the seeds, and black smut reached 80%. Nine mu of wheat were planted, and only six dou were harvested. Five households in Zhenhu Village, Wu District, used Longgong medicine to mix seeds for 27 mu of wheat land, and only 5 mu of land had 2% wheat stinking smut. Other households in the village generally suffered from wheat stinking smut because they were not disinfected, and some accounted for 50%, which caused the masses in the village to believe in science and technology, and generally paid attention to seed selection during the summer harvest.

Removing diseased plants and ears has also been implemented in some areas, and has achieved practical results. Sidu Village, Jincheng, etc., removed 13,000 catties of wheat black smut in two days. According to statistics from nine districts in Guo County, 3,800 people removed 112,000 black smut plants of major autumn crops. Beishe Village, Wuxiang, removed diseased plants from 140 mu in two days, eliminating the spread and expansion of the disease.

In terms of insect pest control: it exceeded any previous year, basically ensuring that crops were not made into disasters. According to incomplete statistics from 48 counties, 800,000 mu of fields and 16,000 fruit trees were treated in time, and suffered no loss or little loss. In the prevention and control methods and the use of pesticides, we adopted the combination of mass soil medicine and soil methods with scientific medicines and scientific guidance. 180,000 mu of underground pests were controlled with red alum. Huguan County United Cooperative sold 67,000 catties of black alum. Wuxiang dug up 100,000 catties of various soil medicines, and Yaoshanggou Village dug up 20,000 catties of Yangtao roots.

In terms of prevention, in addition to strengthening autumn plowing in the autumn, most areas organized the masses to exchange seeds for seed selection and crop rotation this spring. Four villages in Kelan, Guo County, and Huguan rotated 548 mu, and Xiangyuan promotion area dug and burned 60% or more of the millet stubble on 11,000 mu of millet stubble land.

This year, aphids occurred widely, and prevention and control were also more timely. According to statistics from 25 counties including Linfen, 400,000 mu were treated. In order to prevent the occurrence of aphids, Jinan launched a campaign to prevent aphids and remove five kinds of grass (spinning wheel, pig's ears, dandelion, bitter giant, plantain). According to statistics from eight counties including Linjin, Ronghe, Jie County, Xinjiang, Quwo, Hejin, Pinglu, and Anyi, 256 cadres were organized to specifically lead the weeding. In 91 villages in five counties including Ronghe, 16,771 people were also organized to remove weeds from roadsides in more than 100 villages. Linjin, Xinjiang, Quwo, and Jie County cleared 60,000 mu of weeds on the edges of cotton fields and 425 ditch dikes. In the Chengguan District of Linfen, the Normal School Middle School mobilized 1,900 people to help the masses remove weeds in various villages. Linfen No. 1 Middle School alone formed 19 groups with 524 people to remove weeds in 19 villages in the four districts. In May, Quwo County transferred 58 office cadres to mobilize weeding and insect control. In Nanlinjiao Village, San District, 5,000 mu of weeds were removed in four days. Men in Shangpei Village repaired water canals, and organized 80 women to remove weeds. In terms of treatment and removal, many areas are still timely. Linfen, Lishi, Hongdong, Lin County, Xin County, and Guo County all organized cadres to go to the countryside to prevent and control. Some counties also used scientific agents. Lishi transferred 11 cadres and 32 students to treat 54 households and 201 mu of cotton aphids in 19 villages. Xin County sprayed 279 mu with 22 sprayers. Linfen also transferred 74 cadres and students and 50 sprayers to prevent and control cotton aphids. In July, locusts were found in 70 administrative villages and 40 natural villages in 13 counties including Jincheng, Gaoping, and Lingchuan, with a damage area of about 160,000 mu. According to statistics from 10 counties including Jincheng, 291 cadres and 102,000 people were mobilized to completely eliminate locusts on 153,000 mu of land. Seven counties captured 22,000 catties of locusts. Less work has been done in preventing and controlling fruit tree pests. According to statistics from Jincheng, Guo County, Jinyuan and other counties, 18,000 fruit trees were treated. In Donggou and other seven villages in Jincheng, the special county farm mobilized 4,155 people to divide into 57 detachments and 512 groups to implement the four-light movement of cutting light, scraping light, sweeping light, and burning light. The prevention and control of 15,254 trees was completed in ten days; at the same time, 200 sprayers were used to spray pesticides on 15,254 fruit trees once. It is estimated that after spraying, the yield of pears can be increased by 3.3 million catties, equivalent to 3,000 shi of rice, accounting for 24% of the total agricultural income.

In the past year, in the work of disease and insect pest prevention, we have achieved great results by firmly grasping the policy of prevention over cure, especially advocating simple and easy-to-implement methods such as warm soaking medicine mixing and crop rotation and cleaning the fields. In the treatment and removal of diseases and insects, the concentrated efforts to eliminate is also a successful experience, but there are also many shortcomings: First of all, not enough attention is paid to the serious research and summary of effective prevention and control methods and local medicines among the masses, which limits the in-depth development of the mass prevention and control movement. Secondly, the technology cannot keep up. Some diseases and insects are not understood by the masses, and we are the same. At the same time, due to the lack of technical personnel, some of the medicines and machinery that have been issued cannot be used, and some are used incorrectly, resulting in drug damage. This is also the most difficult point in the past year.

Furthermore, the promotion of medicines and machinery is blind due to lack of experience and insufficient understanding of the actual situation, which not only fails to exert its due effectiveness, but also suffers losses.

III. Farm Work

There is one provincial farm, seven special zone farms, and seventy-nine county farms in the province. Among them, four new special zone farms and thirty-six county farms were built this year. According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 11,482 mu of land, an increase of 5,486 mu compared with 5,996 mu last year, and 915 employees, an increase of 353 compared with 562 last year. The old provincial and special zone farms have been appropriately supplemented in terms of experimental instruments, books and other equipment.

From the development of 79 county farms, they can be roughly divided into three types. The first type has a relatively clear farm policy and task, good cadre conditions and equipment, and considerable achievements in breeding and promotion. There are 21 such farms, including Xiangling, Tunliu, Yicheng, and Jie County. For example, Yicheng County Farm bred 21 mu of Si Zi cotton, No. 169 wheat, Huanong No. 5 awned locust wheat, red bald wheat and other varieties of 31 mu, and 811 millet 8 mu, totaling 60 mu of various improved varieties. According to the distribution of crops in the county, cotton, wheat and 811 millet promotion areas were delineated, and Xiguan, Beizhang and other four villages were designated as promotion base villages, and technical personnel were assigned in the field to conduct technical guidance at any time. At the same time, comparison tests of pruning and no pruning of Si Zi cotton, and bone meal fertilizer effect tests and drug efficacy prevention and control tests were also carried out in the field. The second type of county farm implements the policy and task poorly, some focus on on-site work, some focus on off-site work, and the tasks are parallel and there is no focus. There are 34 such farms, including Lishi, Fushan, Yuanqu, Huo County, Guo County, and Xiyang. For example, Huo County Farm only paid attention to on-site breeding work, and did not pay attention to off-site promotion of improved varieties and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Another example is that Fanshi County Farm, although it attaches importance to off-site promotion work, does not pay enough attention to on-site land breeding of improved varieties. The third type of county farm has unclear policies and tasks, and the cadres are not sound. It does not pay attention to breeding and promoting improved varieties, seed selection, soaking and mixing seeds, or simply manages the on-site land, so that the farm is reduced to a formality. There are 24 such farms, including Ji County, Rui County, Wutai, and Heshun. The provincial, special, and county farms generally take the promotion and breeding of improved varieties and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests as the central task, and some farms also pay attention to the promotion of cultivation and fertilization techniques.

In terms of experimental work, the provincial and special eight farms held 16 wheat trials, 6 cotton trials, 16 millet trials, 6 sorghum trials, 11 corn trials, and 6 other potato trials, totaling more than 50. From the experimental results, Changzhi Special Farm confirmed that Dingxian No. 72, Jinan Liangzhong, and Youzi wheat are three varieties suitable for cultivation in the area. The provincial farm's winter wheat variety regional adaptation test showed that Beijing No. 11 has good yield and quality. The Taiyuan area is suitable for sowing around the Autumn Equinox. In the cotton test, Yuncheng Special Zone Farm's Si Zi cotton was the best in the cotton variety comparison test of the four provincial special zone farms, and Linfen Special Zone Farm's No. 517 was the best, and it was confirmed that it can be promoted separately in various parts of southern Jin. In the millet test, the provincial farm concluded that the three varieties with many tillers, Da Mao Gu, Zhong Mao Huang, and Ling 45-48-1, are the best and have promotional value. The four varieties without tillers, Qin Zhou Huang, Bai Liu Sha, Qi Tou Bai, and Ya Ta Che, are the best. De Xian Jin Queen corn has the best quality and yield, and Jin Queen can generally be promoted in large quantities in Jinzhong and Jindongnan areas. For wheat black smut, various drug treatments and comparative tests with the methods of the masses proved that Gu Ren Lesheng and Jin produced Wang Tong are the most effective among the drugs. Warm water soaking and sorghum wine mixing are only second to the above two drugs, and have a strong bactericidal effect, which can be promoted in large quantities. However, in the experimental work, not enough enlightenment and absorption of mass experience, except for the Changzhi Special Zone Farm, the other farms are poorly combined with the masses.

In terms of breeding and operation, the provincial and special eight farms have a total of 6,656 mu of land, breeding 5,751 mu of improved varieties, producing approximately 893,424 catties of original grain, which can be promoted to 170,000 mu, and 906 mu of land are planted with ordinary varieties. The vast majority of the operating methods adopt the employment system. Only the Yuncheng Special Zone Farm uses the employee profit-sharing system, and the Linfen Special Zone Farm is trying the profit-sharing contract system. From the work of one year, the employee profit-sharing system of the Yuncheng Special Zone Farm has played a role in rewarding production enthusiasm and improving production efficiency, but we have not yet summarized it to make it systematic.

Experience and Problems

In the work of the past year, we believe that there are the following experiences and problems:

I. In the production movement of the past year, technical guidance has generally been valued. Cadres have deeply felt from not understanding technology to requiring learning technology that they cannot lead the masses' production well if they cannot bring technology to the countryside and cannot give the masses technical guidance. The ideological foundation for accepting science and technology has also been preliminarily laid among the masses. All localities have attached great importance to technical training and technical transmission. In the spring, agricultural cadre technical training courses were held in Taiyuan, Changzhi, Yicheng, Linfen, and Xing County, with 656 trainees participating. Many counties have also held technical training for village-level cadres, labor models and skilled workers, reaching more than 1,100 people in eight counties including Yushe. However, problems continue to arise in the promotion of technology. The promotion of improved varieties is not combined with the guidance of cultivation techniques. For example, the superior seeds planted in Yangqu and Qingyuan were planted late, with dense seedlings and thin land, resulting in less harvest than local species. Improved seeds are purchased without appraisal, resulting in mixing with soil and chaff, and the masses are unwilling to accept them. Cotton seeds are purchased, and most of them have poor germination rates, causing losses. Sprayers cannot be used, medicines cannot be mixed, or six-six-six is mixed into the ground as fertilizer. New-style agricultural implements are broken and cannot be repaired, and short screws cannot be bought. This is the first difficulty encountered in promoting science and technology. The way to overcome this is to strengthen cadre technical training. In 1951, it is planned to train 20,000 people as a bridge for promotion. In addition, organize mass technical transmission, hold necessary technical special training, or agricultural technology exhibitions, and strengthen technical publicity and education from all aspects. Agricultural cadres should also pay attention to making them specialized, so as to gradually accumulate technical knowledge.

II. The masses have shown the greatest enthusiasm and creativity for agricultural technology improvement. In order to study and improve technology, the masses in various old areas have organized technical committees with technical old farmers as the center. There are 95 technical committees in Lucheng County, and they automatically and actively improve cultivation methods, study fertilizer storage and fertilization techniques (such as Guo Yu'en, etc.), and improve more than 20 kinds of agricultural implements (such as Liu Jubao, Zhang Furen, etc.). They have also exerted the effectiveness of local medicines and local methods in killing insects and sterilizing bacteria. The experience of the past year proves that the promotion of science and technology must be combined with the promotion of the inherent experience of the masses. If the masses cannot be improved at the current technical level of the masses, science and technology cannot be accepted by the masses. Our biggest shortcoming is that we have not seriously summarized the experience of the masses. We do not understand that at present we are still in a relatively backward production condition, and the promotion of science and technology is greatly limited by material and technical conditions. Promoting mass experience and relying on the masses to solve problems is still a very important aspect. We should give enough attention to it in the future.

III. We must do a good job of operation while promoting technology. The experience of one year proves that agricultural medicines and machinery, seed mixing agents, new-style agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and improved varieties must have a specialized operating organization responsible for operation. The method of taking the cooperative to operate is correct. Today's situation does not and should not set up operating organizations alone, but it has not sufficiently estimated the difficulties of cooperative cadres who do not understand technology and lack warehouses, etc. In addition, the price regulations were decided late, and the operating lending methods were not decided early, so many medicines and machinery still exist in the warehouse, and have not played a role. This is a serious shortcoming. At the same time, the state must support the promotion of medicines, machinery, agricultural implements, fertilizers, etc. that the masses are not accustomed to using, give a certain amount of promotion and research expenses, and a trial period, and give longer-term loans, such as the Central Ministry of Agriculture's decision that the lending of new-style agricultural implements can be extended to ten years for repayment, which is completely necessary. In addition to strengthening the above-mentioned operating promotion work, we should also hold various undertakings related to it, such as repair and matching stations for new-style agricultural implements and waterwheels, selling various parts such as screws suitable for various specifications (screw specifications should be unified), and leather money leather pipes, etc., as far as possible to give farmers all kinds of convenience, In addition to hoping that the cooperative can handle this business on its behalf, local governments can also organize private merchants to operate.

IV. The promotion of science and technology must be closely combined with mutual aid groups, and must advance steadily with a focus, to ensure that effects occur and establish prestige. At present, all conditions do not allow solving all problems in all regions. Changzhi and other places have divided the promotion area, first do individual experiments, and then promote them in large quantities. Agricultural implements and medicines and machinery focus on cotton fruit trees, and seed mixing agents focus on areas with serious black smut and white hair diseases. The promotion of medicines and machinery must go hand in hand with technical guidance. Guarantee the role, establish the idea of believing in science among the masses. At present, science and technology should also be linked to the struggle against natural disasters. At the same time, we must have a scientific attitude and seek truth from facts. The exaggerated publicity of "the omnipotence of medicines and machinery" must be strictly corrected. In addition, the experience of relying on mutual aid groups in Changzhi and other places to carry out technical promotion is also very good. Entering into contracts with mutual aid groups for improved variety breeding and promotion, or carrying out simple cultivation and fertilization experiments, is a good way to expand promotion and technical transmission.

V. Farm construction is an important key to improving agricultural technology. We must improve the farm structure and strengthen the leadership of the farm. In the past year, not enough universal attention has been paid to the leadership of the farm, and the provincial and special zone farms have not done enough to assist the county farms technically. At present, some farms have not found their work direction, the combination of in-field and out-field work is not good, the connection with the masses is very insufficient, and there is also a lack of specific assistance for mass technical improvement organizations. In the future, county farms should take the promotion of improved varieties and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests as the main task, and farms with conditions can also pay attention to the guidance of improving cultivation methods at the same time. Except for the provincial farm, which focuses on experimentation, the rest of the special zone and county farms should put most of their efforts on organizing and guiding the technical improvement of the masses. On the other hand, carrying out rationalization proposals in farms to improve the enthusiasm and creativity of employees is also an important issue for building good farms in the future, and of course it is also a good way to implement democratic management.

　　一九五零年提高农业技术总结
    山西省人民政府农业厅工作情况
    今年农业技术改良工作，是以推广优良品种，防治病虫害及农场建设为重点，兹将一年来的工作情况分述如下：
        一、推广优良品种
    根据五十四个县的统计，春季播种中，推广良种五九二、九三七亩，超过原定任务一三·四三％。据已经知道的一些材料来看，大体都增产一成至二成，如金皇后玉米平均增产三成，也有如李顺达种的金皇后产量达九百余斤，超过当地品种一倍以上，夏季选种，已引起各级领导的重视，据六十二个县的统计共选出小麦一八、九四五、二五三斤，并于秋播时，在二一○万亩土地上下种，秋季选种较夏选又深入了一步，在一部分劳动模范村及一部分工作基础较好的老区，大都进行了田间参观和田选，据已有的材料来看，在一部分先进村田选约达五○％，并做到单收、单打、单藏，也有少数村试行了玉米隔行去雄选种，现据三十个县的不完全统计秋选达七四五万斤，可播二八○万亩，在夏秋两季选种中，不仅提高了群众的科学知识，且出现了不少的选种能手，最突出的是陵川的魏毛孩，他采用“就地评比、留优、汰劣”的方法，把本村二三种谷子，经过评比后留下三种其余全部淘汰，并注意管理，保持各种品系，这便给改良品种打下良好基础，同时经过选种运动，也使一部分干部和群众，认识了选种是花钱少收效大的有力的增产方法，因而给一九五一年增产也打下了一定的基础，但是在选种和推广优良品种中，还存在着不少的缺点，甚至是严重的错误。首先是“对就地评选留优汰劣”的方法和“就地评选组织互换和调剂”的方针不够十分明确，因而在指导上不够具体和显得无力，甚至在某些地方过分的强调了引用外来品种和大力收购优种，结果因为缺乏经验和组织力量薄弱，出了不少毛病，使国家资金受了损失，如从山大农场收购的八一一谷种，不仅有一部分籽粒不饱且拌沙掺土，致群众不愿意要，又如汾阳专区收购调剂棉籽四十四万斤，分配给榆次专区和晋源、清源、中阳、交城等县，结果都出了很大毛病，至现在还算不清账，在运城专区收购的一部分麦种，结果推不出去，当然有计划的引种外来优种和适当的收购当地优种以资调剂繁殖是对的，但是由于过分的强调，甚至盲目的收购调剂致造成了不可弥补的损失（全面的具体情况正在澄清）。其次推广优种和推广耕作技术结合的不够，如汾阳专区推广四——一九八高粱时，没有给群众介绍栽培方法，致二千余亩四——一九八高粱还不如本地品种打的多，甚至有些根本没有成熟，除赔偿一万斤米的损失外，群众很不满意，给以后推广造下困难，也有不注意作物的特性和适应性即盲目的推广，如孝义县把一六九号小麦种在低凹地带，结果群众叫做“一斗九”，复次在选种和推广中不够及时如夏选中技术指导没有赶上季节，推广队下乡到临汾辅导工作时，已开始收获，运城专区小麦已收去一半，失去推动田选的时效，更有的把种子运到后已过了季节，结果费力不讨好，最后就全省来说，选种工作还不够普遍开展和深入，不仅不少地区（具体情况尚未澄清）未开始这一工作，且在已开始的地区，由于技术缺乏和工作不深入致陷于形式主义，甚至在少数地区起了“麻烦”作用。
        二、病虫害发生情形及防治工作
    据七个专区七十八县三、九九四村不完全统计，受病虫害面积一、三○○万亩，果树三○万株，在病害方面，临汾忻县五十一县（十二个全县）不完全统计，小麦黄锈病，谷子白发病，麦谷玉茭高粱黑穗病达一、○○○万亩，只小麦黄锈病一种即七○○万亩，平均减产一五％，谷子白发病二十四个县即被害八十六万亩，平均减产一一％，在害虫方面，七十八个县二、九七一村发生蚜虫、蝼蛄、蝗虫、二十八星瓢虫、粟螟虫、梨星毛虫等三十种，为害麦谷山药等作物三○○万亩，梨枣树三○万株，其中棉蚜五十九个县即被害一三四万亩，占棉田总面积六○％。地下害虫在四十县中被害有九一万亩，二十八星瓢虫二十一县一、○六九村为害山药三七万亩，其他如粟螟虫、虸蚄虫为害亦甚严重。
    在病虫害防治方面：我们的方针是防重于治，发扬群众经验与推广科学技术并重，春季晋城等四十三县九○九村推广区种籽消毒九六万亩，占各该地区播种面积七九％，兴、忻两专区消毒用酒二十七万斤，壶关使用柏油一、九○○斤。棉区浸种向来有习惯，代县、沁县、五台部分地区消毒达四○％，新区阳曲消毒二○％，今秋冬麦消毒，据阳曲、祁县、襄垣、洪洞、太谷、榆次等县消毒面积占播种面积四七％。从种籽消毒效果检查来看，据屯留二区郭庄村许心孩、许敬明、赵武英三户小麦经过温汤浸种没有发病，每亩收四、五斗，赵臭孩没有浸种，黑穗病达七五％，五亩的麦地只收七斗，李保成未浸种黑穗病八十％，种麦九亩，只收了六斗，五区甄湖村有五户用龙汞药剂拌种麦田二十七亩，只有五亩地发生小麦腥黑穗病二％，村中其他各户因未消毒麦田普遍发生腥黑穗病，有的占五○％，引起该村群众相信科学技术，夏收中普遍重视了选种。
    拔除病株病穗亦有部分地区实行，并取得实际效果，晋城司徒村等二日内拔除小麦黑穗病一三、○○○斤，崞县九个区统计三、八○○人拔除大秋作物黑穗病一一二、○○○株，武乡北社村二日内拔除病株一四○亩，治除了病害的蔓延扩大。
    在害虫防治上：超过任何一年，基本上保证作物未使成灾，据四十八个县不完全统计及时治除了八十万亩田禾，及果树一六、○○○株，未受损失或少受损失，在防治方法与使用药剂上，采取了以群众土药土法为主结合科学药剂与科学指导，使用红矾防治地下害虫十八万亩，壶关县联社卖出黑矾六七、○○○斤，武乡刨各种土药十万斤，窑上沟一村刨洋桃根二○、○○○斤。
    在预防上除秋季加强秋耕外，今春大部地区组织群众互换种籽选种轮作，岢岚崞县壶关四个村轮作五四八亩，襄垣推广区一一、○○○亩谷茬地刨烧谷茬达六○％以上。
    今年蚜虫发生普遍、防治亦较及时，据临汾等二十五个县统计，防治达四十万亩，为了预防蚜虫发生，晋南曾发动防蚜除五草运动（纺花车、猪耳朵、蒲公英、苦巨、车前草），据临晋、荣河、解县、新绛、曲沃、河津、平陆、安邑等八县统计即组织了干部二五六人，专门领导除草，在荣河等五县九一村亦组织了群众一六、七七一人除了百余村村边道旁杂草，临晋、新绛、曲沃、解县清除棉田地边杂草六○、○○○亩，沟堰四二五道，在临汾城关区发动师范中学组织了一、九○○人到各村帮助群众除草，仅临汾一中即有五二四人组成一九个小组在四区十九个村中除草，曲沃县在五月间抽调机关干部五八人发动除草防虫，在三区南林交村四天内除草五、○○○亩，上裴村男人修水渠，组织八十个妇女进行除草，在治除上不少地区亦尚及时，临汾、离石、洪洞、临县、忻县、崞县，都组织干部下乡防治，部分县并使用了科学药剂，离石抽调干部一一人，学生三二人在十九个村治了五十四户二○一亩棉蚜，忻县用喷雾器二二架喷射了二七九亩，临汾亦抽调干部与学生七十四人，喷雾器五十具防治棉蚜。七月间在晋城高平陵川等十三县七十个行政村四十个自然村，发现蝗虫为害面积约有十六万亩。据晋城等十县统计，即动员干部二九一人，发动群众一○二、○○○人，在一五三、○○○亩土地上，完全扑灭，七县捕获蝗虫二二、○○○斤。防治果树害虫工作做的较少，据晋城、崞县、晋源等县统计有一八、○○○株果树进行治除，晋城东沟等七村由专署县府农场动员四、一五五人划分五七个分队，五一二个小组施行剪光、刮光、扫光、烧光的四光运动，十天内完成了一五、二五四株的防治；同时使用喷雾器二○○台在一五二五四株果树上普遍喷射药剂一次，估计经喷治后，可增产梨三三○万斤，折米三、○○○石，占农业总收入二四％。
    一年来在防除病虫工作上由于紧紧的掌握了防重于治的方针，特别是提倡简而易行的温浸药拌和调茬换种及清理田野等方法收到了很大效果，在治除病虫上，采取了集中力量进行扑灭，亦是一个成功的经验，但亦有不少的缺点：首先是认真的研究总结群众中的有效防治方法和土产药剂做的不够，这就限制了群众性的防治运动的深入，其次技术赶不上去，有些病虫群众不懂又没法，我们亦是一样，同时由于技术人员缺乏，现发下的药械，有些不能使用，有的用错了，反中药害，这亦是一年来最棘手的一点。
    复次推广药械工作由于缺乏经验，和对实际情况掌握的不够，因而带有盲目性，不仅未能发挥它应有的效力，且亦遭到损失。
  三、农场工作
    全省现有省农场一处，专区农场七处，县农场七十九处，其中本年新建专区农场四处，县农场三十六处，据不完全统计，共有土地一一、四八二亩，较去年五、九九六亩增加五、四八六亩，职工人员九一五人，较去年五六二人增加三五三人，省专旧有农场在试验仪器图书等设备方面均有适当补充。
    从七十九个县场工作发展情况来看，大体可分为三种类型，第一类和农场方针任务比较明确，干部条件及设备较好，繁殖推广工作均有相当成绩，此类农场计有襄陵、屯留、翼城、解县等二十一处，如翼城县场今年繁殖斯字棉二十一亩，一六九号小麦，华农五号有芒蚂蚱麦，红秃麦等品种三十一亩，八一一谷八亩，共计各种优种达六十亩，并根据县内作物分布情况划定棉麦和八一一谷推广区，以西关北张等四村为推广基点村，并指定场内技术人员随时进行技术指导工作，同时并在场内进行了斯字棉整枝与不整枝比较试验，及骨粉肥效试验和药效防治试验。第二类县场贯彻方针任务较差，有的偏重场内工作、有的偏重场外工作，对任务平列没有重点，此类农场计有离石，浮山、垣曲、霍县、崞县、昔阳等三十四处，如霍县农场仅注意了场内繁殖工作，对场外推广优种防治病虫害等工作均未重视，又如繁峙县场虽然重视场外推广工作，而对场内土地繁殖优种则不够重视。第三类县场对方针任务不明确，干部亦不健全，对繁殖推广优种选种浸拌种不重视，或单纯经营场内土地，因而使农场流于形式，此类农场计有吉县、芮城、五台、和顺等二十四处。省专县各级农场在工作方面除省专试验场着重试验研究工作外，一般是以推广繁殖优良品种防治病虫害为中心任务，亦有部分农场注意耕作施肥技术推广者。
    在试验工作方面，省专八个农场举行小麦试验十六个，棉花试验六个，谷子试验十六个，高粱试验六个，玉米试验十一个及其他马铃薯试验等六个，共计五十余个。从试验结果看来，长治专场肯定定县七二号、济南良种及蚰子麦三个品种适于该区栽培，省农场冬小麦品种区域适应试验以北京十一号产量质量都好，太原区播种时期以秋分节左右为适宜，棉花试验在四个省专场棉花品种比较试验中，运城专区农场以斯字棉为最优，临汾专区农场以五一七号为最佳，肯定可以在晋南各地分别推广，谷子试验在省农场得出分蘖多的大毛谷，中毛黄及铃四五—四八—一等三个品种最好，有推广价值，不分蘖的有沁洲黄、白柳沙、齐头白及压塌车等四种为最优。玉米以德县金皇后品质产量都佳，一般金皇后在晋中，晋东南区都可以大量推广。对麦类黑穗病，接种做各种药剂处理与群众中的办法比较试验，证明了药剂中以谷仁乐生及晋产王铜为最有效。温汤浸种及烧酒拌种亦仅次于上两种药剂，杀菌效果很强，可以大量推广。但试验工作中，启发与吸收群众经验不够，除长治专区农场外其他场与群众结合的很差。
    繁殖经营上，省专八个农场共有土地六、六五六亩，繁殖优良品种五、七五一亩，产原粮约计八九三、四二四斤，可以推广一七○、○○○亩，尚有九○六亩地种普通品种。经营方式采雇用制的占绝大多数，只有运城专区农场用雇工分红制，临汾专区农场试行分红合同制，从一年的工作看来运城专区农场的雇工分红制已起了奖励生产积极性和提高了生产效率的作用，但是我们还没有加以总结，使之条理化。
  经验与问题
    在一年来工作中，我们认为有以下经验与问题：
    一、在一年来的生产运动中，一般说是重视技术指导的，干部们由不懂技术到要求学习技术，他们已深刻感到不能带技术下乡，不能给群众以技术指导，就不能领导好群众的生产。在群众中也初步奠定了接受科学技术的思想基础。各地均十分重视技术训练与技术传授，开春在太原、长治、翼城、临汾、兴县五处举办了农业干部技术训练，参加受训者六五六人。不少县份亦举办了村级干部劳动模范能手的技术训练，仅榆社等八县即达一千一百余人，但在技术推广工作中仍然不断发生问题，推广优良品种不结合栽培技术的指导，如阳曲、清源种的优种因迟种，苗稠地薄，反而比本地种少收。收购优种不加鉴定，以致掺土，籽秕，发生群众不愿要的情事。收购棉籽，大部发芽率不好，造成损失。喷雾器不会使，药品不会配，或者把六六六掺在地里当肥料使。新式农具坏了不会修，短了罗丝买不到，这是推广科学技术碰到的第一个困难，克服的办法是加强干部技术训练，一九五一年拟训练二万人，做为推广桥梁，此外组织群众性的技术传授，举办必要的技术专题训练，或农业技术展览，从各方面加强技术的宣传教育，农业干部亦应注意使其专业化，以便逐渐积累技术知识。
    二、对于农业技术改良工作，群众表现了最大的热情与创造能力，老区各地群众为了研究改良技术，以技术老农为中心组织了技术委员会，潞城一县即有技术委员会九十五个，他们都自动地积极地改良耕作方法，研究保管肥料与施肥技术（如郭玉恩等），改进农具亦有二十余种（如刘聚宝、张辅仁等）在杀虫杀菌方面亦发挥了土药剂土办法的效用。一年来的经验证明推广科学技术必须与发扬群众固有经验相结合，不能在群众的现有技术水平上提高群众，科学技术即无法为群众所接受。我们的最大缺点是未认真的总结群众的经验。不了解在目前我们仍然处在较落后的生产条件下推广科学技术，物质与技术条件均有很大限制，发扬群众经验依靠群众解决问题，仍然是很重要的一面。今后应予以足够的重视。
    三、推广技术同时必须做好经营工作，一年的经验证明，关于农用药械，拌种药剂，新式农具，化学肥料以及优良品种等，必须有专营机构负责经营。采取了通过合作社经营的办法是对的，今天的情况不可能也不应该单独设立经营机构，但未足够估计合作社干部不懂技术与缺乏仓库等困难，再加之价格规定较迟，经营出贷等办法未即早决定，因之很多药械还存在仓库，而未发挥作用，这是严重缺点，同时推广群众尚无习惯使用之药械农具肥料等，国家必须予以支持，给以一定数量的推广研究费用，及试用期限，给以较长期的贷款，如中央农业部决定新式农具出贷可延至十年归还，是完全必要的，除加强上述经营推广工作外，还应举办与其有关的各种事业，如新式农具与水车等的修配站，出售适合各种规格的罗丝（应该统一罗丝规格），及皮钱皮管等各种零件，尽量给农民以各种方便，除了希望合作社能代办这一业务外，各地政府亦可组织私商经营。
    四、推广科学技术要与互助组密切结合，要有重点的稳步前进，保证发生效果树立威信，目前一切条件均不允许在所有地区解决一切问题，长治等地划分的推广区，先做个别试验，然后大量推广，农具药械以棉花果树为重点，拌种剂以黑穗病白发病严重区为重点，推广药械必须与技术指导同时并进。保证发挥作用，在群众中树立相信科学的思想。在目前，更应使科学技术与对自然灾害斗争联系起来。同时也必须有科学态度实事求是，“药械万能”的夸大宣传，必须严格纠正，此外长治等地依托互助组进行技术推广的经验也是很好的，与互助组订立合同进行优种繁殖推广，或进行简单的耕作施肥试验，都是扩大推广与技术传授的很好方法。
    五、改良农业技术农场建设是重要关键，必须健全农场机构加强对农场的领导。一年来对农场的领导是不够普遍重视的，省、专区农场对县农场的技术协助亦做的不够。目前尚有若干农场找不到工作方向，场内场外工作结合的不好，与群众的联系非常不够，对群众性的技术改良组织，亦缺乏具体帮助，今后县农场应以做好优种推广、防治病虫害为主要任务，有条件农场还可同时注意改进耕作方法的指导，除省农场以试验为主外，其余专区、县农场则应以大部力量放在组织与指导群众的技术改良上，另一方面在农场中开展合理化建议，提高职工的积极性和创造性，也是今后建设好农场的重要问题，当然也是实行民主管理的好方法。
