     III. Basic Experience in Establishing a Propaganda Network

    In the past year, we have had both successful and unsuccessful experiences in establishing the Party's propaganda network. Some progressed with planning and steps, while others took detours and progressed slowly. In the past, we have not conducted systematic research and summary of the successful and unsuccessful experiences of various regions, which is of course a major shortcoming. In the future, in order to correctly implement the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party," we believe that summarizing experience and lessons from the past year's practice is very necessary.

    What are our basic experiences and lessons?

    First, the importance and systematic leadership of Party committees at all levels are the basic key to establishing and consolidating the propaganda network.

    Judging from the work of establishing propaganda networks in various regions, significant achievements have been made in regions where Party committees attach importance to and carry out systematic leadership. Conversely, the results are more general or not significant enough. In places where importance is attached to the work of establishing a propaganda network, their leadership experience can be roughly summarized into the following points: A. Formulate relatively practical plans based on local specific conditions; B. Call on the whole party to attach importance to it, with each level responsible, everyone taking action, earnestly conducting pilot projects, and promptly overcoming erroneous understanding and deviations; C. Conscientiously cultivate and select propagandists, pay attention to the political quality of propagandists, and earnestly implement the appointment procedures for propagandists, etc.; D. Strengthen the work leadership of propagandists and establish and adhere to various leadership systems; E. Conduct timely inspections and summaries, and exchange and promote experience. Because the Party committee attaches importance to and conducts systematic leadership, the work of establishing the Party's propaganda network can advance steadily and gradually develop on a relatively solid foundation. For example, some regions have been conducting pilot projects with steps since the spring plowing period last year, and promoting experience throughout the province. After inspections and summaries during the spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest periods, the propaganda network has been able to develop more robustly. Another example is that the propaganda network in a certain area can advance with a base. Before July, there were 499 propagandists, 1,055 in October, and 1,794 by December. In areas where the propaganda network is relatively developed, the idea of ​​neglecting the Party's propaganda work has been gradually overcome, and certain erroneous arguments have been corrected. The voice of attaching importance to the Party's propaganda work is becoming louder and louder. The established propaganda member organizations are basically normal, and the political quality of the propagandists is relatively pure. The leadership system for the work of propagandists has been initially established.

    However, some regions lack sufficient understanding and importance to the work of establishing a propaganda network, and therefore lack systematic leadership. For example, some places adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the work of establishing a propaganda network. The Party committee only provides empty "principled policy leadership" and pushes the work of establishing and leading the propaganda network to the trade union's cultural and educational department, cultural center, or even the club; some places advocate "joint leadership" (Party, trade union, Communist Youth League); some places have a "three-legged" leadership form (that is, the public security police station convenes propagandists, the cultural center presides over the meeting, and the Party committee is responsible for giving lectures). The result of this laissez-faire approach is bound to be a bias towards quantity over quality. In some places, in order to pursue quantity, a large number of developments are carried out without pilot projects. The propagandists who are absorbed have not undergone training and education, nor have they been carefully selected and undergone appointment procedures. Some places have adapted all the personnel of the reading group, the communication group, and the safety inspection into Party propagandists, filling the ranks with incompetent people, "one counts as one." This has caused the propagandist organization to suddenly swell up and become a "false fat man." After the propagandist organization is established, it lacks serious and regular leadership. Without leadership, it is naturally difficult for the propagandists to play a role, so a large number of scrubbing methods are adopted. For example, an individual factory or mine established a propaganda network of 255 people at once, and after a few days, it scrubbed 155 people at once. Taking such a frivolous and irresponsible attitude towards the establishment of a propaganda network is completely contrary to the spirit of the Central Committee's decision. At the same time, due to the massive development without leadership and neglecting the political quality of propagandists, this gives class dissidents an opportunity to take advantage of. In the propagandist organizations in individual places, reactionary party and league elements, reactionary military police, Taoist elements, and people with impure political qualities have been mixed in, obtaining a legal status to carry out reactionary propaganda. On the other hand, some places have mystified the work of establishing the Party's propaganda network, looking ahead and behind, acting timidly, and demanding too much from propagandists. For example, in a factory with 386 employees, 30 party members, and 80 youth league members, there are only 5 propagandists (4 party members and 1 youth league member). Some places have established propagandist groups in the branch, but dare not announce it to the masses, their concern is that publicity will have a bad impact. Some places have been slow to establish a propaganda network because they are afraid of formalism. In fact, this is the idea of "throwing away food because of choking."

    Second, the work of establishing a propaganda network must be closely integrated with production, combined with the direct tasks of the local area and the political movements of the people at various periods, led by the Party branch committee, and the propagandists should be mainly composed of grassroots cadres.

    The method of combining production, combining the direct tasks of the local area, and establishing a propaganda network from the movement is a better method. This is not only because "what you do, you publicize," completely combining the work of establishing the propaganda network with the current task, but also because many activists will emerge in the movement, making it easy to find propaganda objects. Experience has proven that those activists who emerge from the movement, and then are cultivated and improved, will become worthy of the name of Party propagandists after being approved as Party propagandists. Conversely, if the propagandists selected are separated from production and the specific tasks of the local area, and have not been tested by the movement, nor are they completely voluntary, then although they have passed the branch's review and approval in organizational procedures, such propagandists will not necessarily play a role. Hailun Urban District in Heilongjiang Province selected objects from more than 200 propaganda workers who participated in the peace signature movement through the method of summarizing work and evaluating achievements, and the Party committee approved some of them as Party propagandists. Yongdian District Yaocangzi Village in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, carefully planned the selection and cultivation of propaganda objects step by step during the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement, conducted individual talks, helped propagandists solve difficulties in their work, and after mobilizing labor, air defense and anti-special forces, and sideline production, etc., the branch finally discussed and passed it, and the district committee approved 15 propagandists. This method of establishing a propagandist organization in the movement has been proven to be a good experience.

    The work of establishing a propaganda network must be led by the branch, and the propagandists should be mainly composed of grassroots cadres. The branch is the basic organization of the Party, a fighting fortress of the people. The Party's various policies and propositions must be implemented through the branch, and the branch is also the organization of the Party closest to the masses, and is relatively familiar with the lives and requirements of the masses. Therefore, the work of establishing a propagandist organization must be led and controlled by the branch. All propagandists should be organized into the propagandist group led by the branch, led by the branch, and become a powerful assistant to the branch in carrying out mass propaganda. The vast majority of grassroots cadres are outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and revolutionary activists. They are scattered in vast industrial and mining enterprises, rural areas, and cities. They are in frequent contact with the masses and are the actual executors of the Party and the people's government's policies. Therefore, the Party's propagandists must be mainly composed of grassroots cadres. If they are separated from this group of backbones and are not the main force, but are dominated by external forces or ordinary Party members, Communist Youth League members, and non-Party activists, then it is naturally "abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial." Of course, the Party should also pay attention to selecting propagandists from ordinary Party members, Communist Youth League members, and non-Party revolutionary activists in accordance with the propagandist conditions instructed by the Central Committee's decision. Experience has proven that, in general, the propagandist organizations established by grassroots cadres and led by the branch play a role; otherwise, although there is a propagandist organization in form, it will not play a significant role in practice.

    In the past mass political movements, in order to carry out mass propaganda work, various regions have organized many large-scale temporary propaganda teams. These temporary propaganda teams are generally composed of students from secondary schools and above, primary and secondary school teachers, cultural center cadres, and organ cadres, relying on these temporary propaganda teams to carry out propaganda in cities and rural areas.

    The advantage of this temporary propaganda team is that it can organize propaganda forces relatively widely, encompassing various kinds of talents, promoting the enthusiasm of the masses, and can open up the situation relatively quickly and achieve certain results and effects. However, because this propaganda team is temporarily organized, it naturally contains many shortcomings and weaknesses. 1. Because the members of the temporary propaganda team come from various aspects, they are not very familiar with the production situation in factories and rural areas, and they do not have a deep understanding of the ideological situation of the masses at a certain period, and their living languages and habits are not connected with each other. Therefore, in propaganda, they can only be limited to general explanations of current affairs. It is difficult to combine the specific tasks of the local area and the ideological problems of the masses very well. Therefore, in terms of propaganda content, it is easy to produce a general problem, and propaganda is not easy to penetrate into people's hearts. 2. The propaganda work of the temporary propaganda team is generally carried out independently from the branch and grassroots cadres. This will weaken the enthusiasm of the branch and grassroots cadres to carry out mass propaganda. 3. Although the temporary propaganda team can create a sensation for a while and achieve certain results, it is difficult to maintain the regularity and persistence of propaganda work, thus making mass propaganda work "intermittent."

    Judging from the mass propaganda in the past year, temporary propaganda teams have a certain role to play, and in the future, this organizational form will still be needed to mobilize more talents to carry out mass propaganda of the whole people. However, this temporary propaganda team can only be an assistant to the regular Party's propaganda network, playing an auxiliary role in propaganda work. Therefore, at present, we should use the main force to establish the Party's propaganda network, and do not put the main energy on organizing temporary propaganda teams. In the past, some regions were satisfied with the work of organizing temporary propaganda teams for a long time, putting their main energy on this, which affected the work of establishing the Party's propaganda network, which should be corrected in the future.

    Third, the law of establishing and consolidating the propaganda network is from point to surface, combining points and surfaces, seeking consolidation in development, and re-developing in consolidation. Constantly improve and move forward continuously.

    Advancing steadily from point to surface, combining points and surfaces, with emphasis and positions, is the law of carrying out various tasks. The work of establishing a propaganda network is a new task, and we lack mature experience, so it is even more necessary to grasp this law. In the past, in the work of establishing a propaganda network, many regions have grasped this law and applied it very well. For example, the Party committee propaganda departments from the province, city, locality to the county (including enterprise Party committees and general branches) started work, earnestly tried to establish a propaganda network, and conscientiously and quickly promoted the experience of the pilot project to the surface. In the work of consolidation and improvement, we first obtained the experience of consolidation and improvement, and then promoted it to the surface. Only by constantly obtaining the experience of the points and constantly promoting the experience of the points to the surface can we gradually improve and move forward continuously.

    Seeking consolidation in development and re-developing in consolidation is an inseparable unity. In many places, when developing propagandists, they paid attention to carrying out training and education, explaining the important significance of the propaganda network, inspiring the enthusiasm of propagandists, conducting current affairs and policy education, improving the ideological and political level of propagandists, and conducting necessary propaganda business training. The methods of education are to adopt individual talks, or training classes, or through propaganda work conferences, or through current affairs speech contests, and so on. After these propagandist organizations were established, in the work of consolidation and improvement, they paid attention to continuing to look for new propagandist objects and cultivate their abilities. Therefore, under the leadership of the branch, these propagandist organizations have been continuously developed. Facts have proven that this is a good experience. However, in the past, some places did not pay enough attention to the method of combining points and surfaces and the relationship between development and consolidation. Or they promoted it comprehensively without a pilot project; or they isolated the pilot project without seriously summarizing and promoting experience; or they only conducted pilot projects in provinces and cities without promoting the Party's leading organs at all levels to conduct pilot projects; or they only focused on development and neglected consolidation work, causing the established propagandist organizations to experience a "waste land" phenomenon; or they divided development and consolidation work into two stages. These are obviously wrong.

　　东北区建立宣传网的经验  （一续）
    富振声
     三、建立宣传网的基本经验
    去年一年，我们在建立党的宣传网的工作中，有成功的经验，也有失败的经验。有的是有计划有步骤地前进，有的则走了一些弯路，进展较慢。过去我们对各地的成功与失败的经验，还没有进行有系统的研究与总结，这当然是个很大的缺点。今后，为了正确地贯彻中共中央《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》，我们认为从过去一年来的实践中总结经验与教训是十分必要的。
    我们的基本经验和教训是什么？
    第一，各级党委的重视与系统领导，是建立与巩固宣传网的基本关键。
    从各地建立宣传网的工作看来，凡是党委重视与进行系统领导的地区，建立宣传网的工作就获得了显著的成绩，反之，成绩就比较一般或不够显著。在重视建立宣传网工作的地方，他们的领导经验大体可以归纳为下列几点：甲，根据当地具体情况，制定比较实际的计划；乙，号召全党重视，各级负责，大家动手，认真试点，及时克服错误认识与偏差；丙，认真培养与选拔宣传员，注意宣传员政治质量，切实执行宣传员的任命手续等；丁，加强对宣传员的工作领导，建立与坚持各种领导制度；戊，及时进行检查总结，交流推广经验。由于党委重视与进行系统领导，因而使建立党的宣传网的工作，能稳步前进，在比较巩固的基础上逐步的发展起来，如某些地区从去年春耕期间，即有步骤地进行试点，并在全省范围内推广经验，经过春耕，夏锄，秋收各时期的检查总结，就使宣传网能比较壮健地发展起来。又如某地的宣传网能有阵地地前进，在七月以前为四百九十九名，十月为一千零五十五名，至十二月则增至一千七百九十四人。在宣传网比较发展的地区，忽视党的宣传工作的思想是逐渐被克服了，某些错误论调被纠正了，重视党的宣传工作的声音是越来越响亮了。已建立起来的宣传员组织，基本上是正常的，宣传员的政治素质比较纯正。对宣传员工作的领导制度业已初步建立。
    但也有些地区，由于对建立宣传网的工作认识不够，重视不够，因而也就缺乏系统的领导。如有些地方对建立宣传网的工作采取放任自流的态度，党委只有空洞无物的“原则政策领导”，把建立与领导宣传网的工作，推给工会文教部，文化馆，甚至推给俱乐部去领导；有的地方提倡“共同领导”（党、工会、青年团）；有的地方存在“三足鼎立”的领导形式（即公安派出所召集宣传员，文化馆主持会议，党委负责上课）。这种放任自流的结果，就必然发生重量不重质的偏向。有些地方，为了追求数量，不经过试点即进行大量发展，对被吸收的宣传员，既未经过培养教育，也未经过认真选拔与履行任命手续。有些地方，把读报组，通讯组，安全检查的全部人员，改编为党的宣传员，滥竽充数，“有一个算一个”。这样就使宣传员组织，突然膨胀起来，成为“虚胖子”。宣传员组织建立起来之后，又缺乏认真与经常的领导，不领导，宣传员自然很难发挥作用，于是又采取大量洗刷的办法。如个别厂矿，一下子建立了二百五十五人的宣传网，过了几天一下子又刷去一百五十五人。对建立宣传网采取如此轻易与不负责的态度，是与中央决定精神完全相违背的。同时由于无领导的大量发展，忽视宣传员的政治素质，这就给阶级异己分子以可乘之机。在个别地方的宣传员组织，竟被反动党团分子，反动军警，道门分子以及政治品质不纯的人混了进来，取得进行反动宣传的合法地位。另一方面，有些地方把建立党的宣传网工作神秘化了，瞻前顾后，小手小脚，过份慎重，对宣传员要求过高。如某工厂，全厂职工三百八十六人，党员三十人，团员八十人，但宣传员只五人（四个党员，一个团员）。有的地方已在支部中建立了宣传员小组，但不敢在群众中公布，他们的顾虑是怕公开了影响不好。有的地方，对建立宣传网的工作，一直是迟迟不前，原因是怕犯形式主义。其实这是“因噎废食”的想法。
    第二、建立宣传网的工作，必须密切结合生产，结合当地直接任务以及各个时期的人民群众政治运动，由党的支部委员会负责领导，宣传员应以基层干部为主体。
    结合生产，结合当地直接任务，从运动中建立宣传网的方法，是一种较好的方法。这不仅由于“做什么就宣传什么”，把建立宣传网的工作完全和当前任务结合起来，而且也由于在运动中会涌现出许多积极分子，容易找出宣传员的对象。经验证明，凡是从运动中产生的积极分子，再加以培养和提高，那么被批准为党的宣传员之后，是会成为名符其实的党的宣传员的。反之，如脱离生产脱离当地具体任务所选拔的宣传员，既未经过运动的考验，也非完全出于自愿，那么虽然在组织手续上经过了支部的审查和通过，但这样的宣传员是不一定起作用的。黑龙江海伦城区从参加和平签名运动的二百多名的宣传工作者中，通过总结工作评判成绩的方法，选拔出对象，由党委批准一部分为党的宣传员。辽东宽甸县永甸区窑场子村，在抗美援朝运动中，经过支部的认真计划，有步骤的选择与培养宣传员对象，进行个别谈话，帮助宣传员解决工作中的困难，经过动员勤务，防空防特，副业生产等宣传后，最后经支部讨论通过，由区委批准了十五名宣传员。这种在运动中建立宣传员组织的方法，已被证明为良好的经验。
    建立宣传网的工作，必须由支部负责领导，宣传员应以基层干部为主体。支部是党的基础组织，是人民群众的战斗堡垒，党的各种政策主张，都要通过支部贯彻执行，而支部又是党最接近群众的组织，对群众的生活与要求也比较熟悉，因此建立宣传员组织的工作，必须由支部领导掌握，所有的宣传员，均应组织在支部所领导的宣传员小组中，由支部领导，成为支部进行群众宣传的有力助手。基层干部绝大多数是优秀的共产党员，青年团员和革命积极分子，他们散布在广大的工矿企业、农村和城市中，他们经常接触群众，是党和人民政府政策的实际执行者，因此党的宣传员必须以基层干部为主体，如果脱离这批骨干不以他们为主，而以外来的力量或以普通的党员团员和非党积极分子为主，那自然就是“舍本求末”了。当然党也应当注意按中央决定所指示的宣传员条件，从普通的党员团员和非党革命积极分子中选择宣传员。经验证明，凡是以基层干部为主，又由支部负责领导所建立起来的宣传员组织，一般地都起作用；否则，形式上虽有宣传员组织，实际作用就不会大。
    过去在历次的群众政治运动中，为了开展群众宣传工作，各地区曾组织过多次的规模巨大的临时宣传队。这种临时宣传队大体以中等学校以上的学生，中小学教师，文化馆干部和机关干部为主，依靠这种临时性的宣传队，在城市和农村中进行宣传。
    这种临时性的宣传队，优点是能够比较广泛地组织宣传力量，包罗各种各样的人材，发扬群众的积极性，能够比较迅速地打开局面，取得一定的成绩和效果。但由于这种宣传队是临时组织起来的，自然就包含着不少缺点和弱点。１、由于临时宣传队的成员来自各个方面，他们对工厂农村的生产情况并不十分熟悉，对群众某一时期的思想状况了解的不够深刻，生活语言与习惯各不相通，因此在宣传中只能限于一般的解释时事，对当地的具体任务以及群众的思想问题难于结合得很好，因而在宣传内容上，容易产生一般化的毛病，宣传不易深入人心。２、临时宣传队的宣传工作，一般是脱离支部脱离基层干部独立进行的。这样就会减弱支部与基层干部进行群众宣传的积极性。３、临时宣传队虽能一时的轰开局面，取得一定的效果，但难于保持宣传工作的经常性与持久性，因而使群众宣传工作“一曝十寒”。
    从去年一年来的群众宣传上看，临时性的宣传队是有一定作用的，今后也还需要用这种组织形式来动员更多的人材进行全民性的群众宣传。但这种临时性的宣传队，只能是经常性的党的宣传网的助手，在宣传工作中起着辅助的作用。因此，在目前我们应以主要的力量来建立党的宣传网，而不要把主要的精力用在组织临时的宣传队上。过去有些地区，长时期地满足于组织临时宣传队的工作，把主要的精力放在这上面，以致影响了建立党的宣传网的工作，这是今后应该注意纠正的。
    第三，建立与巩固宣传网的规律，是由点到面，点面结合，在发展中求巩固，在巩固中再发展。不断提高，不断前进。
    由点到面，点面结合，有重点有阵地的稳步前进，这是开展各种工作的规律，建立宣传网的工作，是一件新的工作，我们缺乏成熟的经验，因此就更须掌握这个规律。过去在建立宣传网工作上，有不少地区是掌握了这条规律的，而且运用得很好。如有的从省、市、地方直到县（包括企业党委、总支）的党委宣传部，大家动手，认真试办建立宣传网的工作，认真地将试办的经验，迅速地推广到面。在巩固和提高工作中，也是先取得巩固和提高的经验，再行推广到面。如此不断地取得点的经验，不断地把点的经验推广到面，才能逐步提高，不断前进。
    在发展中求巩固，在巩固中再发展，这是不容割裂的统一体。有许多地方，在发展宣传员时，就注意进行培养教育，解释宣传网的重要意义，启发宣传员的积极性，进行时事、政策教育，提高宣传员的思想政策水平，进行必要的宣传业务训练。教育的方式，或采取个别谈话，或采取训练班，或通过宣传工作会议，或通过时事讲演比赛会等等。这些宣传员组织在建立起来以后，在巩固提高工作中，又注意继续物色新的宣传员对象，培养其能力。因此，在支部的领导下，这些宣传员组织就得到了不断的发展。事实证明，这是一种良好的经验。但过去有些地方，对点面结合的方法和发展与巩固的关系是注意不够的。或者既未试点就全面推开；或者孤立试点，未认真总结与推广经验；或者只在省、市、进行试点，未推动党的各级领导机关进行试点；或者只顾发展，忽视巩固工作，使已建立的宣传员组织发生“撩荒”现象；或者把发展与巩固工作，分为两个阶段。这些显然都是不对的。
