Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions on the 8th to trade union organizations nationwide regarding further promoting patriotic education on resistance against America and aid to Korea, and preparing for a national May Day demonstration this year. The full text is as follows:

　　Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and openly occupied our country's Taiwan, it has aroused unanimous indignation among people of all strata nationwide, and a vigorous patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes, and defend our country has been launched. The working class across the country has also enthusiastically participated in this great struggle with their own patriotic labor competitions, demonstrations, visits, and support for the People's Volunteer Army. However, it should be pointed out that trade union organizations at all levels have not conducted patriotic education work on resistance against America and aid to Korea widely and deeply enough among the vast number of workers and staff members. Generally speaking, it has been done better in large cities, but not enough in medium and small cities; it has been done better in concentrated large factories and enterprises, but poorly among scattered shop employees, handicraft workers, and miners in remote areas, or it has not yet been carried out in a planned and organized manner; it has been done better among workers in factories and enterprises, but poorly among staff members, and even worse among workers' and staff members' families. It must be known that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and the struggle against this most ferocious enemy is a long-term and complex task. Although the American invading forces in Korea have been continuously severely打击ed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, the American warmongers, who specialize in making fortunes through wars of aggression, have not learned the lessons they should have from their continuous defeats. They are frantically and openly rearming Japan, attempting to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder to expand their war of aggression and salvage their destined failure on the Korean battlefield. Therefore, we must never regard patriotic education against American imperialist aggression as a temporary "provisional" task. It should be known that this is the central content of our long-term and regular political propaganda and education work at this stage, and it is a serious political task. The fruits of victory won by the Chinese working class and the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party after thirty years of arduous struggle must not be violated by any imperialist. "The Chinese people have stood up." We must resolutely defend our motherland and defend our hard-won victories. The Chinese working class is the leading class of the Chinese revolution and has always been at the forefront of opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the current great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the American rearmament of Japan, the vast number of male and female workers and staff members across the country must stand at the forefront of this great movement and become the backbone force in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and our country. In order to further carry out patriotic current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea among workers, staff members, and the vast number of workers' and staff members' families across the country, and to prepare for a national patriotic demonstration on May Day this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereby issues the following instructions:

　　(1) Trade union organizations at all levels across the country must seize upon the current fact of the American rearmament of Japan and more widely and deeply carry out patriotic current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the vast number of workers, staff members, and their families. Those who have already begun to do so should continue to deepen it, using various methods (such as organizing reading newspapers, holding regular symposiums, etc.) to make studying current affairs a regular course for every worker and staff member, and establish patriotic pacts to consolidate the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. In places where patriotic current affairs education has not been well carried out, especially among the vast number of scattered shop employees, handicraft workers, and workers' and staff members' families, it is necessary to combine with other relevant organs and organizations, organize forces, and carry it out in a planned and organized manner. It is essential to mobilize every worker, staff member, every employed laborer, and their families in every city, town, factory, mine, farm, government agency, school, store, and workshop, whether concentrated or scattered, advanced or backward, regardless of gender or age, into this great patriotic movement, and to conduct systematic and in-depth patriotic education for them.

　　(2) The central content of current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea at present should be:

　　1. Oppose the American rearmament of Japan;

　　2. Support the People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army;

　　3. Support the declaration and various resolutions of the World Peace Congress Council on concluding a peace covenant.

　　In areas where land reform is being carried out, this current affairs education must be combined with land reform education so that the broad masses of workers understand that land reform is digging up the roots of reactionary forces, digging up the roots of imperialist running dogs, and is the decisive condition for the great liberation of the Chinese people, and therefore resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the peasants against feudal landlords. In factories and enterprises implementing labor insurance, this current affairs education should be combined with the publicity work of implementing labor insurance, so that the broad masses of workers know that the implementation of labor insurance is the fruit of the victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in overthrowing the rule of imperialism and feudal forces under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and that to protect our hard-won fruits, we must more resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism and oppose the arming of Japan.

　　(3) In terms of the methods and forms of conducting current affairs education, according to existing experience, it is best to adopt the form of accusation or recollection. Every worker and staff member can use their own suffering to accuse Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of various atrocities against the Chinese people in the past, and lead up to the crimes of American imperialism in assisting the Chiang bandits and arming Japan, in order to arouse the working class's deep hatred for the enemy. At the same time, the method of recalling the past life and comparing it with today's life should be used to enlighten the workers, staff members, and their families to love and support the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. This method of accusation and recollection is the most capable of making the broad masses understand and arousing the patriotic indignation and enthusiasm of the broad masses.

　　(4) In this propaganda and education work, we must strive to achieve the following goals:

　　1. Consolidate and expand the patriotic labor competition, and promote and help the Ma Hengchang-style advanced groups play a leading and core role;

　　2. On the basis of raising the awareness of the broad masses of workers, staff members, and their families, expose and monitor special agents, bandits, enemy and puppet military officers, fugitive landlords, and leaders of secret societies and other counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and farms, and strengthen confidentiality and security work to protect the lives and property of the people;

　　3. Establish patriotic pacts for all workers and staff members in factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and farms, or patriotic pacts for workers in the same industry, the same occupation, or even the entire city.

　　(5) Prepare for the May Day demonstration this year as soon as possible. When celebrating May Day this year, we will hold a May Day patriotic demonstration by people of all strata with the working class as the main body. Review the strength of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people themselves, express the determination of the entire Chinese people to unite and defend their motherland; tell the imperialists headed by the United States and the remnants of domestic reactionary forces that if you refuse to stop your acts of aggression, refuse to surrender to the people, and attempt to continue to act rashly, you will only have one dead end to be annihilated. The large-scale, organized, and planned patriotic current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea currently being carried out in various places is a concrete and practical preparation and rehearsal in terms of politics, ideology, organization, and even action for this year's May Day demonstration. Around mid-April, the trade union organizations in various cities should work with local people's organizations to organize a May Day preparatory committee to carefully prepare for the May Day demonstration.

　　Local trade union organizations and industrial trade union organizations in major administrative regions, provinces (regions equivalent to provinces), and cities and counties should obtain the guidance and assistance of the local Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party, convene special meetings, and, based on this instruction and in combination with the specific circumstances of the local area, discuss it in detail and seriously, formulate a concrete plan for implementing this instruction, and submit a special report on the discussion and implementation to the higher-level trade union organization.

　　全国总工会向全国工会组织发出指示
    进一步开展抗美援朝爱国教育  准备今年“五一”全国大示威
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国总工会于八日向全国工会组织发出关于进一步开展抗美援朝的爱国主义时事教育与准备今年“五一”全国大示威的指示。全文如下：
    自从美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争和公然侵占我国的台湾以来，激起了全国各阶层人民的一致愤怒，轰轰烈烈地展开了伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动。全国工人阶级亦以自己爱国主义的劳动竞赛、示威游行、慰问和支援人民志愿部队等实际行动，热烈地参加了这一伟大的斗争。但是，应该指出：各级工会组织在全国广大工人、职员群众中进行抗美援朝的爱国主义教育工作还不够广泛，不够深入。一般地说，大城市中做得比较好，中、小城市中还做得不够；集中的大工厂企业中做得比较好，在分散的店员、手工业工人中以及偏僻地区的矿山工人中做得比较差，或至今尚未有计划、有组织地去进行；在工厂企业的工人中做得比较好，在职员中做得比较差，而在职工家属中做得更差。必须知道，美国帝国主义是中国人民、也是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，反对这个最凶恶敌人的斗争，是一个长期的复杂的斗争任务。目前美国侵略朝鲜的军队，虽然已经不断遭到中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的严重打击，但是，专门靠侵略战争发财致富的美国战争贩子们，并没有从他们不断的失败中取得应有的教训。他们正在疯狂地、公开地重新武装日本，企图把日本人民作为他们扩大侵略战争的炮灰，挽救他们在朝鲜战场上已注定的失败。因此，我们绝不可以把反对美帝国主义侵略的爱国主义教育，当做一时的“临时”任务去看待。应当知道这是我们在现阶段中长期的经常的政治宣传教育工作的中心内容，而且是严重的政治任务。中国工人阶级与中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，经过三十年的艰苦斗争所赢得的胜利果实，绝不容许任何帝国主义者来侵犯。“中国人民已经站起来了”。我们必须坚决保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们已得的胜利。中国工人阶级是中国革命的领导阶级，向来是反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的急先锋。在当前这一伟大的抗美援朝反对美国重新武装日本的爱国主义运动中，全国男女工人、职员群众，必须站在这一伟大运动的最前列，成为抗美援朝保家卫国的中坚力量。为了进一步在全国工人、职员群众及广大职工家属中开展抗美援朝的爱国主义时事教育，并准备今年“五一”在全国举行爱国大示威，全国总工会特作如下指示：
    （一）全国各级工会组织，必须抓紧目前美国重新武装日本这一事实，更广泛、更深入地在广大工人、职员群众及其家属中开展抗美援朝的爱国主义时事教育工作。已经初步进行过的应该继续深入地开展下去，运用各种方法（如组织读报，开定期座谈会等）使学习时事成为每个工人职员的经常课程，并订立爱国公约，将群众的爱国热情加以巩固。尚未很好开展爱国主义时事教育的地方，特别在广大分散的店员、手工业工人及职工家属中，必须结合其他有关机关团体，组织力量，有计划、有组织地开展起来。务使每一个城市、集镇、工厂、矿山、农场、机关、学校、商店、作坊中的每一个工人、职员，每一个雇佣劳动者及其家属，不论是集中的或分散的、先进的或落后的，不分男女老幼，都动员到这一伟大的爱国运动中来，都要向他们进行系统的、深入的爱国主义教育。
    （二）目前抗美援朝的时事教育的中心内容应为：
    １、反对美国重新武装日本；
    ２、支援人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军；
    ３、拥护世界和平大会理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言与各项决议。
    这种时事教育工作，在进行土地改革地区，必须与土地改革教育相结合，使广大工人群众认识土地改革是挖反动势力的根，挖帝国主义走狗的根，是中国人民大翻身的决定条件，因而坚决拥护农民反对封建地主的革命斗争。在实行劳动保险的工厂企业中，这种时事教育应与实行劳动保险的宣传工作结合起来，使广大工人群众知道，实行劳动保险，是中国工人阶级和全国人民在中国共产党领导下推翻帝国主义和封建势力统治的胜利果实，我们要保护我们既得的果实，必须更坚决地反对美帝国主义的侵略，反对武装日本。
    （三）在进行时事教育的方式方法方面，根据已有的经验，最好是采取控诉或回忆的形式。每个工人职员都可用自己遭受的痛苦来控诉日本及蒋介石匪帮过去对于中国人民的各种暴行，一直引到美帝国主义援助蒋匪和武装日本的罪恶，以激发工人阶级对于敌人的深刻仇恨。同时用回忆过去的生活与今天生活对比的方法，来启发工人职员及其家属群众对于人民政府、人民解放军、共产党、毛主席的热爱与拥护。这种控诉与回忆的方法是最能使广大群众了解，最能激起广大群众的爱国义愤和热情的。
    （四）在这一宣传教育工作中，我们要争取达到下列几个目的：
    １、巩固与扩大爱国主义的劳动竞赛，并推动和帮助马恒昌式的先进小组起带头作用和核心作用；
    ２、在提高广大工人职员及其家属群众觉悟的基础上，检举并监视混入到工厂、企业、机关、学校、农场中的特务土匪、敌伪军官、逃亡地主、会门头子等反革命分子，加强保密与保安工作，以保护人民的生命财产；
    ３、订立工厂、企业、机关、学校、农场中全体工人职员的爱国公约，或同一产业、同一职业以至整个城市的工人爱国公约。
    （五）及早准备今年的“五一”大示威。在今年庆祝“五一”劳动节的时候，我们要举行一次以工人阶级为主体的各阶层人民的“五一”爱国大示威。检阅一下中国工人阶级与中国人民自己的力量，表示全中国人民团结一致，保卫自己祖国的决心；告诉以美国为首的帝国主义者及国内反动势力的残余，如果你们不肯停止侵略暴行，不肯向人民投降，企图继续蠢动的话，便只有被歼灭的一条死路。现在各地大规模地有组织、有计划地进行抗美援朝的时事教育，就是今年“五一”大示威在政治上、思想上、组织上以至行动上具体的实际的准备与预演。到了四月中旬左右，各城市工会组织便应与当地各人民团体组织庆祝“五一”筹备会来仔细准备“五一”示威的工作。
    各大行政区、省（相当于省的区），及市县的地方工会组织与产业工会组织，应当取得中国共产党当地党委的指导和帮助，召开专门的会议，根据这一指示，结合当地具体情况，详细地、认真地加以讨论，拟出执行这一指示的具体计划；并将讨论和执行情况向上级工会组织作一专题报告。
      一九五一年三月八日
