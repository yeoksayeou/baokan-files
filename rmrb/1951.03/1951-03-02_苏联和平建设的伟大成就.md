　　The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) announced the "Decision on Further Reducing State Retail Prices of Food and Manufactured Goods." This is the fourth time the Soviet Union has reduced prices since the end of World War II. The announcement of this decision once again proves to the world the unparalleled superiority of the Soviet socialist system and the great success of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. This decision will not only further improve the material and cultural living standards of all Soviet working people, and further strengthen their deep sense of honor towards their Soviet motherland and their enthusiasm for socialist labor; but it will also arouse cheers from people all over the world and their infinite yearning for the Soviet Union, greatly increasing their confidence in bravely advancing towards a better life for mankind, and inspiring their courage in the revolutionary struggle to finally move towards socialism.
　　The reason why the Soviet Union has been able to repeatedly reduce retail prices of consumer goods after the war to improve the welfare of the Soviet people is that the Soviet Union has successfully implemented the Stalin Five-Year Plan for the post-war recovery and development of the national economy, greatly increasing industrial and agricultural products and labor productivity, greatly reducing production costs, and greatly exceeding pre-war production levels. The Soviet Union's successive reductions in retail prices of consumer goods demonstrate the tremendous organizational power of the Soviet state led by the Lenin-Stalin party and the tremendous power of socialist planned economy, and also demonstrate the great achievements of the Soviet Union in pursuing a peaceful policy and striving to develop civilian industries.
　　The warmongers of the Attlee type, in order to deceive and harm their people, and to drive their people into a new war to obtain huge profits for them, reverse black and white, and slander the peaceful policies of peace-loving countries like the Soviet Union as aggressive policies, and slander their own aggressive war policies as peaceful policies. But the eloquent facts have shattered the shameless lies of this group of murderers.
　　While the Soviet Union is constantly implementing price reduction policies, and the living welfare of the Soviet urban and rural working people is constantly improving, capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France are facing an economic crisis. The working people in their countries are increasingly trapped in hunger, poverty and death due to the continuous decline in purchasing power.
　　The Attlee government's implementation of a war preparation policy has caused prices in Britain to continue to rise, and the people's living standards have been brutally attacked. In Britain, wartime rationing has not only not been abolished, but the quantity is still being reduced day by day. According to statistics from the British Ministry of Labor, the price of bread in September 1950 increased by 22% compared with June 1947; the price of grains increased by 12.5%; the price of sugar increased by 66%; butter increased by 50%; and milk increased by 43%. In the forty days around the New Year of 1950, more than forty kinds of products and commodities in Britain announced price increases, including the most necessary items, such as flour, dairy products, coal, fat, and linen. According to official figures published by the British Board of Trade Journal, in November of last year, British wholesale prices were 25% higher than when the pound was devalued in September 1949. According to the "Economist" magazine: The British wholesale price index was 189.5 before the Korean War last year; on January 9 this year, it had risen to 215.9. The rise in wholesale prices means that the already rising cost of living is following suit. Along with high prices come shortages of food and consumer goods and an increasingly severe rationing system. This is the reality of Attlee's "peace policy."
　　In the United States, which is waging a war of aggression against Korea, the lives of the broad masses of people are being ruthlessly exploited. Truman's order on January 26 to implement so-called "price and wage controls" was to fix the maximum price of some commodities at an unprecedented high level in American history, and to exempt many other commodities from "control", while wages, which were far behind prices, were frozen across the board. The index of retail food prices in the United States reached 220.5 on January 5 this year (with the average of 1935-39 as 100), and the cost of living index in November last year had risen to 175.6, exceeding the highest record in American history, i.e., 175 in August-September 1948. Since the start of the Korean War, from June 30 to November 30, 1950, most commodities have risen by 27%. On the basis of the people's already extreme poverty, Truman again proposed a tax increase of 10 billion yuan on February 2 this year, which will increase the average burden on the American people by about 60% compared with before the outbreak of the Korean War.
　　In Marshallized France, which is waging a war of aggression against Vietnam, the working people are groaning on the hunger line. In June 1950, the wage index in France was 911, while prices rose to 1,906 (both with 1938 as 100), that is, actual wages were only 48% of the pre-war level, and the workers' living standards were reduced by more than half. According to estimates by the Economic Research Bureau of the French Confederation of Labor, the minimum living expenses for a single worker should be 20,000 francs per month, while according to official estimates, 27% to 36% of all workers earn less than 10,000 francs per month. Since 1947, the franc has been devalued four times, causing prices to continue to rise, and taxes have increased by about 30 times compared with before the war.
　　The sharp contrast between the two social systems and the two national policies is clearly placed before the people of the world. The unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and its brilliant development prospects are encouraging the people of various people's democratic countries to intensify their efforts in economic construction. The broad masses of people in capitalist countries will also be increasingly determined to wage a resolute struggle against the decadent, cannibalistic system and its rulers. The more consolidated the economic foundation of the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace, and the greater its national strength, the more it will increase the determination of the people of the world to oppose imperialist aggression and to fight to defend peace and a happy life.

### 苏联和平建设的伟大成就

专栏：短评

　　苏联和平建设的伟大成就
    苏联部长会议及联共（布）中央委员会公布了“关于再次减低食品与制成品国家零售价格的决定”。这是苏联在第二次世界大战结束后第四次减低物价。这一决定的公布，再一次地向全世界证明了苏维埃社会主义制度的无比优越性，和苏联和平政策的巨大成功。这一决定，不但将更加提高苏联全体劳动人民的物质和文化生活的水平，更加增强他们对苏维埃祖国深切的荣誉感和社会主义的劳动热忱；并且也将引起全世界人民的欢呼和对苏联无限向往的热情，而大大地提高了他们向人类美满生活道路英勇前进的信心，振奋了他们最后走向社会主义的革命斗争的勇气。
    苏联在战后之所以能够屡次地减低消费品的零售价格，以增进苏联人民的福利，这是由于苏联胜利地执行了战后复兴和发展国民经济的斯大林五年计划，工农业产品及劳动生产率大为增加及生产成本大为减低，并大大地超过了战前生产水平的结果。苏联历次减低消费品零售价格，都表现出列宁、斯大林党所领导的苏维埃国家力量的巨大组织性和社会主义计划经济的巨大威力，同时也表明了苏联奉行和平政策、尽力发展民用工业的伟大成就。
    艾德礼之流的战争贩子们，为了欺骗和陷害他们的人民，阴谋把他们的人民驱入为他们获致暴利的新战争中去，颠倒黑白地把像苏联这样的爱好和平国家的和平政策，胡说成是侵略政策。而把它们自己的侵略战争的政策，胡说成是和平政策。但是雄辩的事实，却粉碎了这一群杀人犯的无耻谎言。
    在苏联不断推行减低物价政策，苏联城乡劳动人民的生活福利不断提高的时候，美、英、法等资本主义国家则正面临着经济危机。它们国内的劳动人民，正因购买力的不断降低而日益陷于饥饿、穷困和死亡。
    艾德礼的政府实行备战政策的结果，已使英国的物价不断上涨，人民生活水平受到残酷的进攻。在英国，战时配给制不但尚未取消，并且数量还在日益削减。据英国劳工部的统计，一九五○年九月份的面包价格较一九四七年六月上涨了百分之二十二；谷物价格上涨了百分之一二·五；糖的价格上涨了百分之六十六；黄油上涨了百分之五十；牛奶上涨了百分之四十三。在一九五○年新年左近的四十天当中，英国又有四十余种产品和商品宣布加价，其中包括最必需的物品，如麦粉、牛奶制品、煤斤、脂肪、麻布等。据英国商务部杂志所发表的官方数字，去年十一月份英国批发物价比一九四九年九月英镑贬值时高出百分之二十五。据《经济学者》杂志发表：英国批发物价指数在去年朝鲜战争以前为一八九·五；今年一月九日则已上升为二一五·九。批发物价的上涨，就意味着已经不断上升的生活费用跟着跃进。和高物价同时俱来的，则是粮食和消费品的短缺和配给制度的益形加厉。这就是艾德礼“和平政策”的实际。
    在进行侵略朝鲜战争的美国，广大人民的生活正遭受着无情的剥削。杜鲁门于一月二十六日下令实施所谓“物价及工资管制”，就是把一部分商品的最高限价钉定在美国历史上空前的高度，并豁免了其他许多商品的“管制”，而对于远落在物价后面的工资，则一概加以冻结。美国食物零售价格的指数，在今年一月五日已达二二○·五（以一九三五——三九年的平均数为一百），生活费指数在去年十一月即已上升到一七五·六，超过了美国历史上最高纪录，即一九四八年八月至九月的一七五。朝鲜战争开始以后，自一九五○年六月三十日至同年十一月三十日，大部商品即上涨了百分之二十七。杜鲁门在人民已经十分贫困的基础上，又于今年二月二日提出增税一百亿元的要求，这将使美国人民平均负担较朝鲜战争爆发前增加约百分之六十。
    在进行侵略越南战争的马歇尔化的法国，劳动人民正呻吟在饥饿线上。一九五○年六月法国的工资指数为九一一，物价则升至一、九○六（均以一九三八年为一百），即实际工资仅及战前的百分之四十八，工人生活降低了一半以上。据法国劳工联盟经济研究局的估计，独身工人每月最低生活费应为二万法郎，而据官方估计，占全部工人百分之二十七到三十六的工人，每月工资不及一万法郎。自一九四七年以来法郎已四次贬值，引起物价不断上涨，而捐税也比战前增加约三十倍。
    两种社会制度和两种国家政策的鲜明对比，正清楚地摆在全世界人民的面前。社会主义制度的无比优越性及其光辉灿烂的发展前途，鼓舞着各人民民主国家人民加紧经济建设的努力。资本主义国家的广大人民，也将因之愈益坚定地向腐朽的吃人制度及其统治者进行坚决的斗争。世界和平堡垒苏联的经济愈趋巩固，国力愈趋增加，更加百倍增强了全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略，为保卫和平与幸福生活而斗争的决心。
