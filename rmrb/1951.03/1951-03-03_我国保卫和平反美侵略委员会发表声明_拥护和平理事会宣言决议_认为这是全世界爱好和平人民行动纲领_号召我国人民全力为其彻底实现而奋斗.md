Xinhua News Agency, 2nd of March: The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression has issued the following statement in support of the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions:

　　The first session of the World Peace Council held in Berlin has concluded victoriously. The meeting issued a solemn declaration calling for the world's five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, and France—to conclude a peace pact. The meeting passed nine important resolutions, including plans for peacefully resolving issues concerning Germany, Japan, and Korea. The declaration and plans are concrete and effective ways to stop war and defend peace. This is the path and goal for hundreds of millions of peace-loving people worldwide to strive for today.

　　We firmly support the World Peace Council's declaration. A meeting of the five major powers and the conclusion of a peace pact is an urgently necessary step to consolidate world peace and ensure international security. The Soviet Union has long proposed such a suggestion in the United Nations. The People's Republic of China has always expressed its agreement and support for this suggestion. However, the imperialist aggressive bloc has consistently been unwilling to accept this suggestion. While war-mongers are actively preparing for war and expanding aggression in practice, they are also shouting peace slogans loudly. But peace and aggression are not matters of sophistry; they must be proven by actions and facts. The World Peace Council's declaration clearly states, "Any government of the five major powers that refuses to hold meetings to conclude such a pact proves that that government has aggressive designs." From now on, hundreds of millions of people around the world will open their eyes and watch the actions of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France!

　　We firmly support all resolutions of the World Peace Council regarding the peaceful resolution of issues concerning Germany, Japan, and other countries. Opposing the rearmament of Germany and Japan by American imperialists, opposing the militarization and fascization of Germany and Japan, and advocating the conclusion of comprehensive peace treaties with Germany and Japan respectively based on past international conventions and agreements, this is the World Peace Council's position, and it is precisely the hope of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The World Peace Council's plans for resolving the issues of Germany and Japan both advocate being based on the popular will of the countries concerned through a referendum. The German issue should be determined by "a nationwide referendum of the German people"; the Japanese issue should be decided by "a nationwide vote in Japan." Peace is built on a foundation of genuine democracy. Using genuine democracy to guarantee genuine peace is an absolutely fair and reasonable method, and it is also the wish of the German and Japanese people. No government of any country can oppose this resolution under any pretext.

　　We firmly support all resolutions of the World Peace Council regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. They are fair, practical, and capable of resolving the problem. Based on the definition that "the heinous act of a country using its military against another country first, regardless of the pretext, is aggression," the Council believes that the United Nations' decision to label China as an "aggressor" is "unjust and illegal" and demands that the United Nations rescind this resolution. This voice of justice from the Peace Council not only has the support of all the Chinese people, but it will certainly receive a universal response from people all over the world.

　　The World Peace Council's demand to "immediately convene a meeting of all relevant countries" to peacefully resolve the Korean issue; its demand for "the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea," allowing "the Korean people to decide their own internal affairs," completely conforms to the will of the Chinese people; this is precisely the goal of our Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

　　The first session of the World Peace Council was successful. The meeting achieved great success. The declaration and resolutions of the meeting are a program of action for peace-loving people worldwide. We fully accept and fully support these new historical declarations and resolutions; we call on all the Chinese people to strive to realize these great declarations and resolutions.

　　我国保卫和平反美侵略委员会发表声明
    拥护和平理事会宣言决议
    认为这是全世界爱好和平人民行动纲领
    号召我国人民全力为其彻底实现而奋斗
    【新华社二日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会为拥护世界和平理事会的宣言和决议发表声明如下：
    世界和平理事会在柏林举行的第一届会议已经胜利地结束了。会议发表了一个庄严的宣言，要求世界五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国及法国——缔结和平公约。会议通过了九项重要的决议，内中包括用和平方式解决德国、日本、朝鲜等问题的方案。宣言和方案都是制止战争保卫和平的具体而有效的办法。这是全世界亿万爱好和平人民今天努力奋斗的途径和目标。
    我们坚决拥护世界和平理事会的宣言。五大国举行会议并缔结和平公约是巩固世界和平与保障国际安全的迫切必要的步骤。苏联在联合国中早已提出过这样的建议。中华人民共和国对这种建议一向表示赞同和拥护。但是帝国主义侵略集团却始终不愿意接受这个建议。战争贩子们一面在实际上积极准备战争和扩大侵略，一面在口头上也把和平口号喊得震天响亮。但是和平与侵略不是诡辩的问题，是要用行动和事实来证明的。世界和平理事会的宣言说得清楚，“不论五大国的任何一国政府拒绝举行会议缔结这种公约，就证明该国政府有侵略的图谋。”今后全世界亿万人民就要张开眼睛注视美、英、法三国政府的行动了！
    我们坚决拥护世界和平理事会关于以和平方式解决德国、日本等问题的一切决议。反对美帝国主义者重新武装德国、日本，反对德国、日本的军国主义化和法西斯化，主张根据以往的国际上的公约和协定对德、日两国分别缔结全面和约，这是这次世界和平理事会的主张，这正是全世界亿万人民的希望。世界和平理事会关于解决德国、日本的方案都主张以有关国家的民意公决为基础。德国问题应取决于“德国人民的全民公决”；日本问题应在日本“进行全国规模的民意投票”。和平建筑在真正的民主基础上。用真正的民主保障真正的和平，这是绝对公平合理的办法，也是德国、日本人民的愿望。无论什么国家的政府，都不能用任何借口来反对这个决议。
    我们坚决拥护世界和平理事会关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一切决议。它们是公正的、切合实际的、可以解决问题的方案。理事会依据这样一个定义，“不论借口如何，对另一个国家首先使用军队的国家的这种罪恶行为，就是侵略”，认为联合国诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的决定是“不公正而且非法的”，并要求联合国取消这个决议。和平理事会这种正义之声，不止得到了全中国人民的支持，并且一定能得到全世界人民的普遍响应。
    世界和平理事会要求“立即召开一切有关国家的会议”以和平解决朝鲜问题；要求“从朝鲜撤退外国军队”，让“朝鲜人民自行决定他们的内政”，这与中国人民的意志完全符合，这正是我中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动的目标。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议是成功的。会议有了伟大的成就。会议的宣言和决议是全世界爱好和平人民的行动纲领。对这些新的历史性的宣言和决议，我们全盘接受，我们全力支持；我们号召全中国人民为实现这些伟大的宣言和决议而奋斗。
