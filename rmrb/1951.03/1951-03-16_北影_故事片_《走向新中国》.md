1945, on the very day of the old China's National Day, the Double Tenth Festival, metallurgical engineer Chang Wei-liang returns to China after completing his studies in the United States. He believes that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, China should be an independent and sovereign country, but when he gets off the ship and sets foot on his homeland, he sees the unreasonable arrogance of the Americans, which is completely beyond his expectations.

He returns to the China Steel Plant where he previously worked, taking up the position of engineer, hoping to contribute his technology to the country and industrialize China. However, when he submits his painstakingly written factory reform plan to the General Administration, the General Manager not only does not adopt it, but also wants to use him as an anti-communist tool, asking him to sign an anti-communist declaration. Engineer Chang refuses on the spot.

Prices continue to soar, workers cannot make a living, and demand wage increases. Engineer Chang sympathizes with the workers. The puppet trade union deliberately designs a conspiracy to provoke his feelings towards the workers, using Engineer Chang's hand to dismiss the strike leader He Jin-dong.

Due to the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, the factory virtually grinds to a halt. Xu Min, Engineer Chang's brother-in-law, realizes that "to develop industry, China must first be put in order," and resolutely goes to the Liberated Areas. Although Engineer Chang is dissatisfied with the Kuomintang, he does not fully understand the Communist Party either. Therefore, he is extremely depressed and despondent.

Soon, this big city is liberated after a series of city liberations. He first sees the People's Liberation Army welcomed by the people, and then sees the enthusiastic mood of the factory workers. He feels a new atmosphere.

The factory quickly resumes operation after takeover, and Engineer Chang is very happy. At this time, in order to increase production, plans are made to repair the No. 3 Martin furnace, but ferro-manganese is lacking. Engineer Chang has to work with the workers to make electrodes. Engineer Chang only knows how to apply the theories he learned from books to make electrodes, and the result is unsuccessful.

The workers oppose his theory and advocate doing it themselves, but because the pressure is too high, it also fails.

The military representative inspects this work and discovers the ideological differences between the workers and the engineer. Therefore, on the one hand, he educates the workers, and on the other hand, he tries hard to persuade Engineer Chang, showing him the facts. After seeing the real power of the workers, Engineer Chang resolutely unites with the workers to create electrodes.

As a result, not only is the problem of ferro-manganese solved, but the broken furnace can also be started.

Just as the steel plant is celebrating the first batch of steel from the No. 3 Martin furnace, Kuomintang planes come to bomb the factory. He disregards the danger and rushes into the fire to rescue, and is trapped in the fire, unable to get out. At this time, He Jin-dong, who has returned to work in the factory after liberation, sees him and immediately rushes into the fire to save him, but the enemy planes bomb again, and He Jin-dong is seriously injured in order to save him.

They are both taken to the hospital for treatment. After a long time, He Jin-dong wakes up, and when he wakes up, he still cares about Engineer Chang, which moves him to tears.

At this time, the Martin furnace's fire is stopped due to the enemy planes, and the molten steel solidifies and cannot be melted. Everyone tries many methods without success and has to go to Engineer Chang. He immediately rushes back and thinks for a long time, but still has no solution. Finally, inspired by worker Xiao Liu, he comes up with a method: using oxygen. So the whole factory is mobilized, and finally the molten steel is melted, so that the factory does not suffer any loss.

On October 1, 1949, the new China is founded. It is also the first anniversary of the founding of their factory. Engineer Chang and his colleagues are overjoyed and participate in the grand evening party of the whole factory. They have become the masters of the new China.

At this time, the news of the approval of the factory reform plan comes. Engineer Chang is so excited that he cannot speak. Finally, he says to everyone: He will dedicate all his talents, and he will devote all his efforts to build and defend the motherland, because he deeply feels that he is now the master of the country.

    北影·故事片
    《走向新中国》
    编导  吴天  副导演  方荧
    主要演员蓝马　桑夫陈方千　赵森林高平一九四五年，正当旧中国的国庆日双十节那一天，冶金工程师常为梁从美国学成归国。他以为抗日战争胜利了，中国应该是个独立自主的国家，但当他走下轮船，刚踏上祖国土地的时候，他便看到了美国人的蛮横无理，完全出乎他的意料之外。
  他回到原先服务的中国钢铁厂，担任工程师的职务，满想把自己的技术供献给国家，使中国工业化，可是当他把辛辛苦苦写成的工厂改革计划送到总管理处时，总经理不但不采纳，反而要利用他做反共工具，要他在反共宣言上签名，常工程师当场拒绝了。
    物价不断飞涨，工人无法生活，要求增加工资，常工程师同情工人，伪工会为了挑拨他和工人的感情，特别设计了阴谋，借常工程师的手开除了罢工领袖何金栋。
  由于国民党的腐败统治，工厂无形陷于停顿，常工程师的内弟许敏认识到“搞工业首先要搞好中国”，便毅然到解放区去了。常工程师虽然对国民党不满，但对共产党也完全不了解。因此他异常苦闷，他很消沉。
    不久，这个大城市在一连串的城市解放之后也解放了。他首先看到为人民所欢迎的解放军，又看到工厂工人热烈的情绪，他感到一种新的气象。
  工厂迅速的接管后开工了，常工程师很高兴。这时，为了增加生产，筹划修复三号马丁炉，可是锰铁缺少，常工程师不得不和工人们从事造电极的工作。对于造电极，常工程师只会把书本上看来的一套搬来，结果没有成功。
  工人反对他的理论，主张自己干，结果因为压力用得太大，也失败了。
  军代表检查了这一次的工作，发现了工人与工程师在思想上所存在的症结。于是一方面教育工人，也下大力说服了常工程师，拿事实给他看。常工程师在看到工人真正的力量后，便毅然决然的与工人结合起来创造了电极。
  这末一来，不但解决了锰铁的问题，坏炉子也可以开工了。
  正当钢铁厂三号马丁炉庆祝第一炉出钢时，国民党的飞机来轰炸厂房。他不顾危险在火中去抢救，一时陷入大火中，没法儿出来。这时，被解放后回厂工作的何金栋看见了，立刻冲进火里救他，但敌机又来轰炸，何金栋为了救他受了重伤。
  他们同被抬到医院里救治，过了好久，何金栋才醒来，醒来时还关心常工程师，这使他感动得流了眼泪。
  这时马丁炉因敌机飞来停火的缘故，钢水凝结起来化不开，大家想了许多方法也没有用，只好去找常工程师。他立刻赶回来，想了好久，还是没有办法，最后还是由于工人小刘的启示，他想出了一个方法：用氧气。于是全厂都动员起来，终于把钢水化开，使厂里没有受到一点损失。
  一九四九年十月一日，新中国成立了，正是他们的厂建厂一周年，常工程师和他一道工作的同志们都欢欣鼓舞地参加了全厂的盛大晚会，他们成了新中国的主人。
  这时，又传来工厂改革计划被批准的消息，常工 程师兴奋的说不出话来，最后他对大家说：他要把自己的一点才能全供献出来，他将倾全力建设祖国，保卫祖国，因为他深深地感到现在是国家的主人了。
