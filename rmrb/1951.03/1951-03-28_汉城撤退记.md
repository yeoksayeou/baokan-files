　　A Record of the Retreat from Seoul
　　Luye
　　In order to better annihilate the enemy's active forces, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, after annihilating more than 30,000 enemy troops, have already proactively and systematically temporarily withdrawn from Seoul on March 14th. The temporary retreat from Seoul has caused the American military to sink deeper and deeper into the Korean quagmire. When the Chinese and Korean People's forces orderly, proactively, and temporarily withdrew from Seoul, the American warmongers were greatly dismayed, fearfully calling the retreat of the Chinese and Korean People's forces a "mysterious retreat."

　　One morning in March 1951, the sunlight was particularly strong, the ice and snow in the mountains and fields had begun to melt, and the ground was very muddy, exuding the fragrance of earth. Seoul—this mountain city surrounded by mountains—appeared even more vigorous and beautiful. The diligent people all rose up at once, as if suddenly springing up from the ground, carrying sticks, ropes, and other things, demanding to transport supplies for the army. Several days earlier, they had completed the work of clearing the fields and fortifying the walls. This day was for Seoul to transport the last batch of ammunition for the frontline warriors. Youth League member Li Qingle held a rope in his hand and carried a gun on his back. He said, "After sending the army this last time, I won't come back. I want to join the People's Army." His wife, Jin Zhenshu, was a student at Seoul Middle School. During the first retreat from Seoul, she joined a unit of the People's Army as a nurse. Li Qingle remained in the local People's Guerrilla. On this day, during the temporary retreat from Seoul, he joined the ranks of millions of people to support the front lines, assisting the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. That evening, on the quaint streets of Dongdaemun, there were not many people to be seen. The whole city was dark and gloomy. Occasionally one or two patrolling soldiers were encountered, still seriously performing their duties, earnestly and kindly questioning pedestrians. At this time, Seoul appeared particularly resolute and solemn. An elderly man in his sixties, crossed the night to find the last batch of retreating People's Volunteers. He said, "I have lived for more than sixty years, and I have never seen such a benevolent and righteous army like you. You are truly like tigers in battle and like sheep to the people. I believe you will be back soon, and we will see you then." The old man was so moved that his voice trembled. An old teacher from Seoul Middle School said, "I really can't leave my home, but what will I do when those beasts in human skin come?" He finally abandoned his many years of city life and resolutely followed the People's Government. Many female teachers and female students were also in the stream of retreating people, braving the darkness, carrying their packages, and carrying dry food, walking on the mountain roads. A ten-year-old elementary school student said to the People's Army soldier stationed in his home: "I can't bear to leave Changdeokgung Palace. Tomorrow I will follow Ama Ni to Ama Ni's home, and I will come back when you come back." The farmers who had been given land did not hesitate to abandon the land again and followed the Korean People's Army to move. Many merchants also dropped their account books and signed up to support the front lines. "Follow Kim Il-sung, return with Kim Il-sung!" For them, this was not a retreat, but the beginning of a new battle.

　　In those days, the artillery fire of the American invading army bombarded Seoul from across the river, and swarms of enemy planes swooped down and bombed the streets like madmen. But the heroic Seoul remained calm as usual. Cars sped back and forth on the main roads, and the people of Seoul carried on with their businesses as usual. There were still many people doing business in the squares of Dongdaemun and Namdaemun. They treasured the currency of the Korean People's Bank, hiding it away, "This is real money, as hard as iron; unlike paper money, which is blown away by the wind." The workers demolished all buildings that could be used for military purposes, taking away what they could, leaving nothing for the enemy.
　　When the order for the temporary withdrawal from Seoul was issued, the people of Seoul did not feel surprised at all. They pushed their carts that they had prepared long ago, many people carrying their babies on their backs, and walked out of the various alleys, heading in an orderly manner to the areas designated by the People's Government. The artillery of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers bombarded the American invading army cowering on the south bank of the Han River, covering the retreat of the Korean people. By midnight, the people of Seoul who did not want to meet the enemy had all left.
　　On the eve of the temporary retreat from Seoul, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army slowly lowered the solemn national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea flying on top of the tall buildings. At this time, the citizens lowered their raised heads and paid their respects to the national flag. "Seoul, we bid you farewell temporarily, may you be well, we will be back soon!"

　　汉城撤退记
    鹿野
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军为着便于消灭敌人的有生力量，于歼灭敌人三万多人以后，已经在三月十四日主动地有计划地暂时撤出汉城。汉城的暂时撤退，使美军在朝鲜的泥足愈陷愈深。当中朝人民部队秩序井然地主动暂时撤离汉城时，美国战争贩子们大为惶惑，他们惊惧地把中朝人民部队的撤退叫做“神秘撤退”。

    一九五一年三月某日早晨，阳光分外强烈，山野的冰雪已开始融化，地下泥泞得很，透出一股泥土的香味。汉城——这个群山环抱的山城，更显得矫健、美丽了。勤劳的人民一下子都起来了，好像突然从地下钻出来这多的人，拿着棍子、绳子等等东西，要求给军队运输。早在前好几天，他们就做好了坚壁清野的工作，这一天是汉城为前线勇士们运送最后一批弹药了。青年劳动党员李青乐手里拿着绳子，背上还背着一支枪。他说：“送军队的最后一次，我就不回来了，我要参加人民军。”他的爱人金贞淑是汉城中学的学生，第一次汉城撤退时，即参加人民军某部做了护士，李青乐则留在当地人民游击队里。这一天，在汉城暂时撤退的时候，他参加到千万人组成的行列里，支援前线，协助朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。那天傍晚，在东大门一带的古色古香的街道上，已经看不到多少人了。全城黑沉沉的，间或碰到一两个巡逻的战士，他们仍然在严肃地执行着任务，认真而和蔼地盘查着行人。汉城这时分外显得刚毅、肃穆。一个年已花甲的老年人，穿过黑夜找到最后一批撤退的人民志愿军。他说：“我活了六十多岁，从来没有见过你们这样的仁义之师，真是打起仗来像猛虎，对待人民像绵羊。我相信你们不久还要回来的，那时候我们再见吧。”老人感情激动得声音有些发颤。汉城中学的一位老教员说：“我实在离不开家，但是那些披着人皮的野兽们来了我怎么办呢？”他终于抛弃了他多年的城市生活，毅然地随着人民的政府走了。不少的女教员、女学生也在撤退的人流中，冒着黑夜，携着她们的包裹，背着干粮，走上山野的道路。一个十来岁的小学生对驻在他家的人民军战士说：“我舍不得昌德宫。明天我要跟着阿妈妮到阿妈妮家里去，你们回来的时候我也回来。”分得了土地的农民，毫不犹豫地又把土地丢下，跟着朝鲜人民军转移。许多商人也丢下账簿，报名支援前线去了。“跟金日成走，跟金日成回！”对于他们，这不是撤退，而是新的战斗的开始。

    那几天，美国侵略军的炮火隔江向汉城轰击，成群的敌机像发了疯一样地在街道上俯冲轰炸。但英雄的汉城仍然镇静如常，汽车在大马路上驰来驰去，汉城人民们照常各安其业。东大门和南大门的广场上，仍然有很多人在做生意。他们爱惜地把朝鲜人民银行的钱币藏起来，“这是真钱，像铁一样硬；不像毛票子，风一吹就完蛋了。”工人们拆毁了一切可资军用的建筑，能带走的带走，一点不给敌人留下。
    当暂时撤离汉城的命令下达的时候，汉城的人民一点也没有感到突然。他们推起自己早已准备好的小车，有许多人背着自己的婴儿，从各个巷子中走出来，向着人民政府指定的地区秩序井然地走去。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的大炮，向着畏缩在汉江南岸的美国侵略军轰击，掩护着撤退的朝鲜人民。到半夜时，不愿和敌人见面的汉城人民已经走完了。
    汉城暂时撤退的前夕，朝鲜人民军的战士把飘扬在高大建筑物顶上的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的庄严的国旗，徐徐降落。这时，市民们低下昂扬的头，向国旗致敬。“汉城，我们暂时向您告别，愿您安好，我们不久就会回来的！”
