Experiences in Establishing a Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region (Continued)
Fu Zhensheng

V. Forms and Methods of Propaganda

Mass propaganda, like other political and ideological work, has its own specific forms and methods. Over the past year, various localities have used a variety of forms and methods, and have made many new creations and developments. Among them, the following are more effective and popular with the masses:

First, Mass Meetings

Mass meetings are a powerful and effective important form of the Party's political work. In various mass political movements, localities have universally adopted this form. Such as convening worker mass meetings, youth mass meetings, as well as mass gatherings and demonstrations by various professions, groups, or regions. This type of meeting mobilizes a relatively wide range of masses, making it easy to absorb people from all walks of life, groups, and various professions into the movement. Especially in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, groups such as workers, women, cultural, educational, scientific, health, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, and ethnic minorities in various localities held large-scale mass gatherings and demonstrations, demonstrating their firm will to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism's rearming of Japan.

The speakers at mass meetings are mostly responsible cadres of local Party, government, labor union, youth league, and women's federation. These cadres, because of their political cultivation, leadership experience, familiarity with the situation, and prestige among the masses, can systematically explain domestic and international current affairs, clarify the important policy decisions of the Party and the People's Government, and closely integrate major political events with current tasks. Therefore, they are generally welcomed and have a greater effect.

Mass meetings can help us concentrate the attention of the broad masses on the most important political events in a very short period, concentrate on the current tasks proposed by the Party and the government, and enhance the masses' will and enthusiasm to complete these tasks. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, various localities continuously held many mass meetings of different sizes, raising the political awareness of the masses, further realizing the significance of "consolidating national defense and developing the economy," and spontaneously formulating patriotic pacts, enhancing the masses' consciousness in implementing policies and laws.

Whether a mass meeting can achieve results depends entirely on the preparation work of the meeting. Before the meeting, propagandists should be organized to carry out propaganda among the masses, explaining the main content and significance of the meeting, conducting full deliberation, collecting mass reactions and opinions, and enhancing the masses' enthusiasm to participate in political activities. Mass meetings without sufficient preparation are a waste of manpower and money. At the same time, because mass meetings have broad mass participation, sometimes tens of thousands of people participate. Therefore, the convening of such meetings must choose a certain time, avoid being too frequent, and in the organization of the meeting, attention should also be paid to being lean and efficient, with simple and clear speeches that are relevant to the purpose.

Second, Accusation Meetings

Accusation meetings are the most common in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and are an important form of carrying out mass political propaganda. Xifeng's "Think about the past, look at the present, and look to the future"; Haicheng's "Three Dynasties Memories"; Liuhe's "Four Hows": that is, how Manchuria was, how it is now, how American devils are in Korea, and how they would be if they came to China, etc., are the specific content of such accusation meetings. Li, a worker at the Shanhaiguan Railway Station, accused the US military of the blood-stained massacre in Shibalidian in his hometown of Ping'an Town in 1947, which aroused the hatred of all the workers for American imperialism. Even the old worker Guan Shixin, who never spoke and was not active in his work, was moved. Not only did he go on stage to tell his heart, but from then on he really worked actively. Zhang Fenglan, a coil winding worker at Jinzhou Station, had her husband killed by the US-Chiang bandits. At the accusation meeting, she told her grievances, which greatly improved the political awareness of the female workers in the entire class. From winding seventy oil coils a day, she increased to one hundred and thirty-five, and also did part of the work done by male workers. The size of this kind of accusation meeting is determined by different occasions and needs, and generally the accusation meetings of a factory, a workshop, a street, or a village have the greatest effect. The reason why accusation meetings have become an effective way to educate the masses is because they use the masses' experience, the masses' pain, and the masses' interests to educate and mobilize the masses. It is a very good way for the masses to educate themselves. Through this form, the masses' old and new hatreds are concentrated, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are linked together, personal interests and national interests are combined, and they realize the greatness of People's China and the preciousness of the new life. Therefore, they love our great motherland even more and give full play to their fearless spirit of self-sacrifice, and strive to resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression and defend the motherland. Therefore, accusation meetings educate the masses the deepest and most concretely, and mobilize the masses most powerfully.

Third, Small Group Discussions and Individual Talks

Small group discussions and individual talks occupy a very important position in mass propaganda. Propagandists in various localities mostly carry out propaganda through this form. Workshop talks, foreman meetings, pithead meetings, fieldhead meetings, threshing ground meetings, individual talks, and family visits, etc., can be used to carry out simple propaganda anytime, anywhere during production gaps, which is not only in line with the masses' tastes, but also easy to go deep into the masses. Lenin said: "Hold fewer mass meetings, and more individual agitation is needed. …Every conscious male and female worker should use every spare day and hour to do individual agitation." Political talks can not only report news to the masses, report recent current affairs, explain the policy decisions of the Party and the government, and the current tasks of the people, but also discover people's demands and emotions. Most of the more outstanding propagandists in various localities can make the talks very natural and appropriate, and can inspire the masses to express their opinions. They are not afraid of arguments and raising sharp questions, and can guide the masses' thinking onto the right track and inspire the masses to draw correct conclusions. When carrying out current affairs propaganda in various localities, many propagandists use materials such as maps, propaganda posters, cartoons, and news photos. When conducting production talks, they use forms and charts to explain. This form of combining oral propaganda with demonstration and mobilization has a greater effect. For example, after some places used maps for propaganda, the masses reflected: "In the past, we only said that the purpose of American imperialism's aggression against Korea was to use Korea as a springboard to invade China, but we didn't even know where American imperialism was. Now we understand." Some said: "The Soviet Union is so big, who can beat it?" The masses in Linzi Tou Street, Linjiang said: "The big rooster (referring to China) is really bigger than the dung beetle (referring to the United States)."

Fourth, Collective Reading of Newspapers

Reading newspapers is the most important lever to grasp the people of all strata with political influence. Mass political propaganda should start with reading newspapers first. Newspapers are the main propaganda materials in the hands of propagandists. Therefore, organizing the masses to read newspapers should be a regular task of propagandists. The main experience of reading newspapers in various localities is, first of all, to select appropriate materials and choose the parts that are closest to the audience and that they are interested in. Secondly, in terms of reading methods, it should be a combination of reading, speaking, and discussing, giving the audience time to digest and ask questions. If you only read the newspaper as it is, it will make the masses feel boring and reduce the effect of reading the newspaper. Before reading the newspaper, the newspaper reader should pay attention to studying the materials to be read, discover incomprehensible words and sentences in time, and seek to understand them. In order to liven up the reading of newspapers and make it easier for the masses to understand, reference materials should be attached, especially often using maps.

Fifth, Written Propaganda, Charts and Exhibition

Written propaganda includes newspapers, blackboards, leaflets, and quick reports. Newspapers are the main weapons and materials of propagandists. Blackboard newspapers, leaflets, and quick reports play an important role in mass propaganda. Because they are easy to write and publish in a timely manner, and are easily loved by the broad masses, this form is widely used in various localities. The content of blackboard newspapers should be simple and clear, popular and lively, with pictures and drawings, and can be read at a glance. Charts combining current affairs and production have had many new creations in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. For example, some use American aircraft as targets, with anti-aircraft guns representing production teams or individuals, and use shells to indicate the progress of production. Whoever's production performance is good, whose shells will hit the American aircraft first (Truman, MacArthur, etc.). Some use a factory as the starting point for the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the routes of advance of each unit represent the team, to see who will liberate Pyongyang and Seoul first. Some use Tibet as the target, to see whose tanks or red flags will reach Lhasa first. Obviously, this kind of chart combining current affairs and production is much more progressive than simple production charts, airplanes, trains, bullock carts, etc. Various exhibitions of waste products, products to be repaired, products, and standard products in various localities have a great role in promoting production. Especially, it has played a great role in overcoming waste and improving product quality. This form must still be used well in the future.

Sixth, Listening to Broadcasts

In industrial and mining enterprises and urban residents, a powerful means of conducting political work is radio broadcasting. The people's broadcasting is the disseminator of our Party's ideology. Radio broadcasts can quickly transmit current affairs news and policy decisions of the Party and the government to the masses. At present, listening groups have begun to be organized in various factories, mines, and urban residents. Propagandists in various localities must strengthen the leadership of each listening group to keep the listening work regular.

Seventh, Literary and Artistic Propaganda

Various forms of art propaganda, such as drama, yangko dance, big drum, crosstalk, poetry, cartoons, foreign films, clapper talk, doggerel, lantern shows, shadow plays, and glass shadows, have a great role in mass propaganda, especially in rural areas. Ma Delian, a propagandist in Hejiabaozi Village, Yanghe District, Xiuyan, used "Big Drum Discussion Meetings." After finishing a section of the big drum, he organized the masses to discuss, so that the masses fully understood the drum lyrics. The masses welcomed it, and every time there were seventy or eighty people to listen. Wang Shushen (female) and Xu Runzhou, teachers at the Beiguan Branch of the Huanren County Liwan Primary School, created a cartoon crosstalk, drawing the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea into nine cartoons, pointing to the pictures and using crosstalk to express the atrocities of American imperialism, which was vivid, expressive, and very effective. Glass shadows are common in the entire county of Zhaodong and Zhaoyuan. County and district cadres almost all carry glass shadows in their pockets when they go to the countryside to show them in the rural areas. The Liaoyang City Cultural Center created a form combining comic strips and crosstalk. In twenty-four days, the audience reached more than 60,000 people. According to incomplete statistics from Liaodong, 1,499 amateur theater troupes and 882 folk artists in the province performed dramas, foreign films, big drums, crosstalk, lotus songs, doggerel and other programs 13,315 times in one and a half months, with an audience of 2,735,591 people. The Liaodong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' foreign film "Deep Hatred" has a picture showing the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea, that is, a woman was bombed to death by an American plane, and her child crawled out of the blood pit and sucked her mother's nipple. The plot was tragic and moving. It was widely adopted in various places and generally caused the masses to shed tears and hate. Especially the women, just one picture in front of the Yingkou Cultural Center caused more than 100 people to shed tears. Some women went home and everywhere to promote said: "American devils are really bad," the masses themselves launched propaganda. The reason why literary and artistic forms of propaganda are supported by the masses is mainly because this folk art form is familiar to the masses, has traditional customs, the tunes are simple, the singing method is close to the language, it is vivid and image-based, it is suitable for the cultural level of the peasants, and it is easy to accept. The lyrics can specifically express the content of propaganda, ideological content, and are rich and systematic.

VI. Establish a Systemic Leadership over the Propaganda Network

At present, the work of establishing propaganda networks in various localities has taken initial shape and has a good start. Party committees in various localities have taken certain important measures in leading the propaganda network, such as stipulating the content of propaganda, formulating propaganda work plans, deploying inspection work, supplying propaganda materials, and convening propagandist conferences and forums, and holding propagandist training courses. The adoption of these important measures by the leadership has provided the necessary conditions for the establishment and normal development of the propaganda network. However, we must also point out that the degree of leadership and attention paid by the Party committees and their propaganda departments in various localities to the propaganda network is different. The phenomenon of laissez-faire and drifting along still exists in some areas, and the phenomenon of leadership thinking lagging behind reality also still exists. For example, some comrades still have not seriously understood the spiritual essence of the central government's decision on establishing a propaganda network, and their understanding lags behind objective development. They mistakenly believe that establishing a propaganda network for the people in the whole Party is "a blind man wearing glasses - an extra layer of trouble," "we did the work without the organization of a propaganda network in the past few years," "we are very busy now, let's do the work of establishing a propaganda network when we are free," and even individual administrative cadres disagree with the propaganda work of the branch propagandist of the agency, and even proposed to the party branch: "We cannot do these work" and so on. Because of insufficient attention to this work, some places have not seriously established a regular leadership management education system for the propaganda network, and the phenomenon of "grabbing it when it is needed and dropping it afterwards" still exists. This makes the propagandists feel depressed and it is difficult to improve their propaganda level.

The Central Committee's release of the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party" is a major measure taken to fundamentally improve the Party's leadership methods based on the current state of the Party's work. This is a document of great historical significance for the construction of the Party's propaganda work. Establishing the Party's propaganda network for the people is indeed a new thing and a new job for the whole Party. Therefore, we must recognize the significance of this new thing of establishing a propaganda network from the historical point of view of development, and all outdated views on propaganda work and the establishment of a propaganda network are not in line with the times. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice":

"Any process, whether belonging to the natural world or the social world, is moving forward and developing due to internal contradictions and struggles, and people's movement of cognition should also follow the movement and development. In terms of social movements, the truly revolutionary leader...lies in being good at making himself and all personnel participating in the revolution follow the movement and transformation in subjective understanding when a certain objective process has moved and transformed from one stage of development to another, that is, to make the proposal of new revolutionary tasks and new work plans suitable for the changes in the new situation."

The work of establishing a propaganda network is precisely the process of transforming the Party's propaganda work from the past stage to a new stage. Leading cadres at all levels and all Party members must also follow the transformation in subjective understanding, and put forward new plans and programs to adapt to the changes in the new situation. But on this issue, some of our comrades are indeed not transforming quickly enough, and their understanding lags behind reality and lags behind the Party's requirements for them today.

After the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party" was promulgated, the work of establishing a propaganda network in the entire Northeast region will have a new development. In the face of this new situation, it is even more necessary to strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels over the propaganda network. Therefore, the Northeast Bureau emphasized in the decision on implementing the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party": "Strengthening the leadership of Party committees at all levels over the propaganda network and effectively establishing various leadership systems are the basic key to consolidating and improving propagandists and keeping the work of propagandists regular."

How to establish the Party committee's systematic leadership over the propaganda network, and what necessary systems need to be established?

First, strengthen the leadership of propagandists and improve the political and ideological level of propagandists.

The Central Committee pointed out in the decision on establishing a propaganda network: "Party committees at all levels should often discuss the propaganda work for the people, and regard propagandists as an important bridge connecting the Party and the people and give them regular leadership, help and education." At the same time, the Central Committee more specifically stipulates: "The Party branch committee should regularly convene meetings of all the propagandists under the branch, discuss the specific tasks and methods of the branch's propaganda work according to the instructions of the higher level and the conditions of the branch, check the status and experience of the propaganda work, listen to the reports of the propagandists on the situation of the masses, and give the propagandists specific instructions on the work." "The Party committees of cities and counties should convene a joint meeting of branch secretaries or a meeting of propagandist representatives or a propagandist conference once a month, and the secretaries of the city and county committees should make reports on the current situation and tasks, and preside over checking the propaganda work of the previous month and discussing the propaganda work of the next month. Under the conditions of difficult transportation, the county committee can convene such meetings by district. The district committee should be responsible for representing the city committee and the county committee to conduct regular leadership over the propaganda work of the branch, and according to the conditions of each branch, stipulate the regular scope, goals and methods of propaganda activities of each branch. In rural areas, the district committee should establish a system of propagandist transmission stations, and the district committee members should regularly convene propagandists or representatives of propagandists from several branches to transmit propaganda content and propaganda methods, and distribute and explain propaganda materials." "The Party committees of provinces, cities, localities, and counties should regularly provide propagandists with propaganda instructions and materials. Party newspapers and Party journals at all levels should regularly publish articles discussing propaganda work and propagandist work. Party schools and Party training classes at all levels should have courses discussing propaganda work, and should set up short-term rotating training classes for propagandists under possible conditions." These specific regulations of the Central Committee are very important and must be earnestly implemented in various localities. In addition, the Northeast Bureau has also decided that each province and directly-administered city will hold a representative meeting of propagandists in the first half of this year. According to the experience of the Northeast Bureau in convening the first representative meeting of propagandists in the Northeast, this meeting has a great role in promoting propagandist work in various localities. It is not only an effective method for educating propagandists and propaganda work cadres, but also an effective leadership method.

Second, strengthen the planning of work.

With the establishment and development of the propaganda network, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of propaganda work. In addition to the Party committee's propaganda department having a practical and feasible propaganda work plan for each quarter, each propagandist and reporter should also formulate a specific plan for a certain period of time. The plan should specify in detail the content and requirements of the propaganda and the specific steps. Only when the Party committee's propaganda department and the vast number of propagandists and reporters carry out work according to a certain plan can the organization of propaganda work be truly improved and the power of the propaganda network be brought into play.

Third, establish a strict inspection system.

Establishing a strict inspection system is an important guarantee for realizing the Party committee's resolutions and work plans and improving the quality of propaganda. In the Party's grassroots organizations, each Party group should have the responsibility to supervise and help each propagandist's activities, and the Party group leader should report on the propagandist's work regularly. The Party branch committee should regularly check and discuss the propaganda work of a certain production unit, and sometimes discuss the two types of good and bad examples at the same time. Before the discussion, the branch committee members should divide their work and go deep into the masses to observe the propagandist's activities and listen to the masses' reactions. When necessary, they can also organize activists from this unit and another unit to conduct mutual inspection. During the discussion, the relevant group leaders and propagandists can be invited to attend. At this meeting, a resolution should be made on how to improve propaganda work, and after a period of time, the implementation of the resolution should be checked. Party leading organs at all levels should conduct inspections with emphasis. The inspection team should absorb local Party leading cadres to participate. The inspection results should be made into resolutions or written articles, and published in Party journals with the approval of the Party committee.

　　东北区建立宣传网的经验（续完）
     富振声
    五、宣传的形式和方法
    群众宣传和其他政治思想工作一样，是有其一定的形式和方法的。一年以来，各地运用了多种多样的形式和方法，且有不少新的创造与发展，其中收效较大群众比较欢迎的，有下列几种：
      第一、群众大会
    群众大会是一种强大而有效的党的政治工作的重要形式，在各种群众政治运动中，各地普遍地采用了这种形式。如召开工人群众大会，青年群众大会，以及按各种不同职业、团体或地区的群众集会与游行示威等。此种会议动员的群众比较广泛，易于把各阶层各团体以及各种不同职业的群众都吸收到运动中来，特别在抗美援朝运动中，各地的职工、妇女、文化、教育、科学、卫生、工商界、宗教界及少数民族等团体，分别举行了规模巨大的群众集会与游行示威，表现了抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的坚强意志。
    群众大会的报告人，多是各地党、政、工、青、妇的负责干部，这些干部由于他们有政治修养，有领导工作经验，熟习情况，在群众中有威信，既能比较系统地解释国内外时事，阐明党与人民政府的重要政策决定，又能把重大政治事件与当前任务紧密地结合起来，因此一般的均受到欢迎，收效较大。
    群众大会可以帮助我们在很短的期间集中广大群众的注意力于最重要的政治事件，集中于党和政府所提出的当前任务，提高群众去完成这些任务的意志和热忱。抗美援朝运动中，各地持续不断地召开许多范围大小不同的群众大会，提高了群众政治觉悟，进一步认识“巩固国防发展经济”的意义，纷纷自动订立爱国公约，提高了群众执行政策法令的自觉性。
    群众大会能否收到效果，全赖会议之准备工作的如何而定。在会议之前，应组织宣传员在群众中进行宣传，说明会议的主要内容与意义，进行充分酝酿，搜集群众反映与意见，提高群众参加政治活动的积极性。无充分准备的群众大会，是劳民伤财的。同时由于群众大会，具有广泛的群众性，有时几万人参加，因此此种大会的召开，必须选择一定的时机，避免过于频繁，在会议的组织上，亦应注意精干，发言简单明了，切合目的。
    第二、控诉会
    控诉会，在抗美援朝中最为普遍，是开展群众政治宣传的重要形式。西丰的想想过去，看看现在，望望将来；海城的三朝回忆；柳河的四个怎样：即满洲怎样，现在怎样，美国鬼子在朝鲜怎样，来到中国又会怎样等等，就是这种控诉会的具体内容。山海关车站李工友控诉美军一九四七年在他家乡平安镇的血染十八里的大屠杀，激怒了全体职工对美帝国主义的仇恨，连从来不讲话干活不积极的老工人关士信也被感动，不仅上台讲了心里话，从此也真正积极干活。锦州站的卷线女工张凤兰的丈夫为美蒋匪所杀害，在控诉大会上她诉说了自己的苦怨，大大提高全班女工的政治觉悟，从每天卷七十个油线卷，增加到一百三十五个，并且兼做了一部分男工友做的活。这种控诉会的大小是以不同场合与需要而定，一般是以一个厂一个车间，一条街道一个村庄的控诉会的效果为最大。控诉会之所以成为教育群众的有效方式，是由于它是用群众经验、群众痛苦、群众利益，教育群众、发动群众，是很好的群众自我教育方式。通过这种形式，使群众的旧仇新恨集中起来，昨天今天和明天联系起来，个人利益和国家利益结合起来，认识到人民中国的伟大，新生活的可贵，因而更加热爱我们伟大的祖国，发挥了大无畏的自我牺牲精神，为坚决反对美帝国主义侵略保卫祖国而奋斗。所以控诉会教育群众最深，最具体，发动群众也最有力。
    第三、小组座谈和个别谈话
    小组座谈和个别谈话，在群众宣传中占有很重要的地位，各地宣传员多通过这种形式进行宣传。车间讲话、掌头会、坑头会、地头会、场院会、个别谈话和家庭访问等，可以利用生产空隙，随时随地进行简单的宣传，既切合群众口味，又易于深入群众。列宁说：“少开一些群众大会，需要个人鼓动。……每个觉悟的男女工人应当利用每一个空间的日子和钟点去做个人鼓动”。政治谈话不仅是能够给群众报告新闻，报告最近时事，解释党和政府的政策决定，以及人民群众的当前任务，而且可以发现人们的要求和情绪。各地比较优秀的宣传员，大部分都能使谈话进行的很自然、随合，能够启发群众发表意见。他们不害怕争论和提出尖锐的问题，而且能够将群众的思想引入正轨，启发群众得出正确的结论。各地在进行时事宣传时，有许多宣传员利用地图、宣传画、漫画及新闻照片等材料，在进行生产谈话时，利用表格和图表来解释，这种口头宣传与示范鼓动相结合的形式，收效更大。例如有些地方利用地图进行宣传后，群众反映说：“过去光说美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的目的，是想把朝鲜当跳板侵略中国，但美帝国主义在哪，还搞不清楚呢，这回可明白了”。有的说：“苏联地方那么大，谁能打得过呢？”临江林子头街群众说：“真是大公鸡（指中国）比屎克郎子（指美国）”。
        第四、集体读报
    读报是以政治影响去掌握各阶层人民群众的最重要杠杆，群众性的政治宣传，应首先从读报开始。报纸是宣传员手中的主要宣传资料，因此，组织群众读报应该是宣传员经常性的工作。各地读报的主要经验，首先是要选读适当的材料，选择与听众最为接近的部分与感到兴趣的东西。其次，在读报方法上，应该是读、讲、讨论三者相结合，给听众以消化和提问题的时间，如果只照报念报会使群众感到枯燥无味，减少读报效果。读报员在读报之前，应注意研究要读的材料，及时发现费解的字句，并求得了解。为了活跃读报，使群众易于了解，应附有参考材料，特别常常利用地图。
        第五、文字宣传、图表与展览会
    文字宣传包括报纸、黑板报、传单、快报等。报纸是宣传员的主要武器和资料。黑板报、传单、快报等形式，在群众宣传中占有重要的地位，由于它编写容易出版及时，易为广大群众所喜爱，所以这种形式为各地广泛利用。黑板报的内容，应该简单明了，通俗活泼，有图有画，一眼即可看完。时事与生产相结合的图表，在抗美援朝运动中，有了不少新的创造。如有的以美机为目标，以高射炮代表生产小组或个人，用炮弹表明生产进度，谁的生产成绩好，谁的炮弹就先打到美机（杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟等）。有的以某厂为中国人民志愿军的出发点，各路进兵路线代表小组，看谁先解放平壤和汉城。有的以西藏为目标，看谁的坦克或红旗先到拉萨。显然的，这种时事与生产相结合的图表，比起单纯的生产图表、飞机火车牛车等，是进步多了。各地的废品、待修品、产品及标准品等各种各样的展览会，对生产的推动作用很大。特别对克服浪费与提高产品质量起了极大作用，今后这种形式，仍须很好的利用。
        第六、收听广播
    在工矿企业及城市居民中，进行政治工作的强有力手段是无线电广播，人民的广播是我们党的思想传播者。无线电广播可以使时事消息及党和政府的政策决定很快传达到群众中去。目前各厂矿及城市居民中已开始组织收听小组，各地宣传员必须加强对各收音小组的领导，使收音工作保持经常性。
        第七、文艺宣传
    各种艺术形式的宣传，如戏剧、秧歌、大鼓、相声、诗歌、漫画、洋片、快板、顺口溜、幻灯、影戏、玻璃影等，对群众宣传作用很大，特别在农村尤为显著。岫岩洋河区何家堡子村宣传员马德廉的“大鼓座谈会”，说完一段大鼓，便组织群众讨论，使群众完全体会了鼓词，群众很欢迎，每次都有七八十人去听。桓仁县立完小北关分校教师王书绅（女）和徐润洲创造的漫画相声，把美帝国主义在朝暴行，画成九幅漫画，指着图用相声表示美帝国主义暴行，有声有色，情态动人，收效很大。肇东肇源的玻璃影普遍全县，县区干部下乡差不多每个人的兜里都带上玻璃影，以便在农村放映。辽阳市文化馆创造连环画与相声相结合的形式，二十四天中观众达六万多人。据辽东不完全统计，全省一千四百九十九个业余剧团，八百八十二名民间艺人，在一个半月内，共演出话剧、洋片、大鼓、相声、莲花落、顺口溜各种节目一万三千三百一十五次，观众达二百七十三万五千五百九十一人，辽东省文联的洋片“深仇大恨”，有一幅是表现美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行图，即一个妇女被美机炸死了，她的小孩从血坑里爬出来，吸吮他妈妈的奶头，情节悲惨动人，各地普遍采用，普遍引起群众流泪愤恨，特别是妇女群众，仅营口文化馆门前的一幅，即引起一百多群众流了泪。有的妇女回家到处宣传说：“美国鬼子真坏”，群众自己展开了宣传。文艺形式宣传之所以受到群众拥护，主要是由于这种民间艺术形式，为群众熟悉，有传统习惯，曲调简单，唱法接近语言，有声有色，形象化，适合农民文化水平，容易接受。唱词能够具体表达宣传内容、思想内容，充实有系统。
  六、建立对宣传网的系统领导
    目前各地建立宣传网的工作，已初具规模，有了一个良好的开端。各地党委在对宣传网的领导上，曾采取某些重要措施，如规定宣传内容，制定宣传工作计划，布置检查工作，供给宣传材料，召开宣传员大会、座谈会，举办宣传员训练班等等。领导上采取了这些重要措施，就使宣传网的建立与正常发展有了必要的条件。但我们也必须指出，各地党委及其宣传部门对宣传网的领导与重视程度是不同的，放任与自流的现象在部分地区依然存在，领导思想落后于实际的现象也还存在。如有些同志仍未认真领会中央关于建立宣传网的精神实质，认识落后于客观发展，把在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网，错误地认为是“瞎子带眼镜——多一层麻烦”，“过去几年没有宣传网的组织也把工作做啦”，“现在工作挺忙的，把建立宣传网的工作放在闲时候再搞吧”，甚至有个别行政干部不同意机关支部宣传员作群众宣传工作，竟向党总支提出：“我们不能做这些工作”等等。由于对此工作重视不够，因而有些地方对宣传网并未认真建立经常领导管理教育制度，“用时抓来，过后拉倒”的现象还不少，这样就使宣传员感到苦闷，宣传水平难于提高。
    中央发布“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，是根据目前党的工作状况，为了从根本上改进党的领导方法，而采取的重大措施，这是对党的宣传工作建设上具有重大历史意义的文献。建立党对人民群众的宣传网，对全党来说，的确是一种新的事物，新的工作。因此，我们对于建立宣传网这个新的事物，必须从历史的发展的观点来认识其意义，一切对宣传工作与建立宣传网的陈旧观点，都是不合时宜的。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说：
    “任何过程，不论是属于自然界的与属于社会的，由于内部的矛盾与斗争，都是向前推移向前发展的，人们的认识运动也应跟着推移与发展。从社会运动来说，真正革命的指导者，……在于当某一客观过程已经从某一发展阶段向另一发展阶段推移转变的时候，须得善于使自己及参加革命的一切人员在主观认识上也跟着推移转变，即是要使新的革命任务与新的工作方案的提出，适合于新的情况的变化。”
    建立宣传网的工作，正是使党的宣传工作由过去的阶段向着新阶段的推移转变的过程，各级领导干部与全党同志都必须在主观上也跟着推移转变，提出新的计划和方案，以适合于新的情况的变化。但在这一问题上，我们的确有些同志推移转变的还不够快，他们的认识还落后于实际，落后于今天党对他们的要求。
    中共中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”颁布后，东北全区建立宣传网的工作，将有一个新的发展。在这种新形势的面前，就更加需要加强各级党委对宣传网的领导。因此，东北局在关于贯彻“中共中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”的决定中强调指出：“加强各级党委对宣传网的领导，切实建立各种领导制度，是巩固和提高宣传员并使宣传员工作保持经常性的基本关键。”
    如何建立党委对宣传网的系统领导，以及需要建立那些必要制度？
    第一、加强对宣传员的领导，提高宣传员的政治思想水平。
    中央在关于建立宣传网的决定中指出：“党的各级委员会应当经常讨论对于人民群众的宣传工作，并且把宣传员看作是联系党和人民群众的重要桥梁而加以经常的领导、帮助和教育。”同时中央更具体规定了：“党的支部委员会应当经常召集本支部所属的全体宣传员会议，按照上级指示和本支部的条件，讨论本支部宣传工作的具体任务和方法，检查宣传工作的状况和经验，听取宣传员关于群众情况的报告，给宣传员以工作的具体指示。”“市和县的党的委员会应当每月召集一次支部书记联席会议或宣传员代表会议或宣传员大会，由市委书记和县委书记作关于当前情况和任务的报告，并主持检查上月的宣传工作和讨论下月的宣传工作。在交通困难的条件下，县委员会可以分区召集这样的会议。区委员会应当负责代表市委员会和县委员会进行对于支部宣传工作的经常领导，并按照每个支部的条件，规定每个支部宣传活动的经常的范围、目标和方法。在农村中，区委员会应当建立宣传员传授站的制度，由区委委员经常分别召集几个支部的宣传员或宣传员的代表，传授宣传内容和宣传方法，分发和讲解宣传资料。”“省、市、地方和县的党的委员会应当经常供给宣传员以宣传的指示和资料。各级党报和党刊应当经常发表讨论宣传工作和宣传员工作的文字。各级党校和党的训练班应当有讨论宣传工作的课程，并且应当在可能条件下设立宣传员的短期轮训班。”中央这些具体规定，是十分重要的，各地必须认真贯彻执行。此外，东北局还决定各省和直属市，在今年上半年召开一次宣传员代表会议，根据东北局召开东北第一届宣传员代表会议的经验，这种会议对各地宣传员工作有很大推动作用。它不仅是一个教育宣传员和宣传工作干部的有效方法，而且也是一个有效的领导方法。
    第二、加强工作计划性。
    随着宣传网的建立与发展，就必须加强宣传工作的计划性。除了党委宣传部门应有每个季度的切实可行的宣传工作计划外，每个宣传员和报告员也应该制定一定时期的具体计划。在计划中应该详细地规定宣传的内容与要求和具体步骤。只有党委宣传部门与广大的宣传员报告员都按着一定计划进行工作，才能真正提高宣传工作的组织性，发挥宣传网的力量。
    第三、建立严格的检查制度。
    建立严格的检查制度，是实现党委会的决议与工作计划以及提高宣传质量的重要保证。在党的基层组织中，每个党的小组都应有责任监督与帮助每个宣传员的活动，党的小组长应定期汇报宣传员的工作。党的支委会应定期检查与讨论某一生产单位的宣传工作，有时可将好坏两种典型同时讨论。讨论前支部委员应分工深入群众观察宣传员的活动，并听取群众反映。必要时也可以组织这一单位与另一单位的积极分子进行互相检查。讨论时，可以吸收有关的小组长与宣传员列席。在这种会议上应该作出如何改进宣传工作的决议，经过一个时期再检查执行决议的状况。各级党的领导机关，应有重点地进行检查，检查组应吸收当地党的领导干部参加，检查结果，作出决议或写文章，经党委批准在党刊上发表。
