　　Changes Among Our Family Members
      Wang Youmei
    I am Wang Youmei, a family member of a worker at the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, living in the Zhongzhizhai dormitory of the plant's Jindingshan neighborhood. In the past, arguments often occurred among the family members in our dormitory, which meant the workers, tired after a day's work, had to mediate in the evenings. This caused them to go to bed late and they would be listless the next day at work. Such disunity among family members would affect the workers' production. In the past, the family members also looked after themselves and didn't care about others. When someone had a baby or faced other difficulties, no one would help. Take childbirth, for example; because no one would ask a doctor from the plant's hospital, family members would just find an old midwife. Once, a family member surnamed Feng almost lost her life because she hired an old midwife for delivery. If there was a mutual aid organization for the workers' families, these problems could all be resolved. I thought I had to find a way to do something about it, so I discussed it with Wu Yuntong, who lived in the same dormitory. Now that women have been liberated, any difficulties should be resolved through mutual assistance. Although we all agreed to do this, we were afraid we couldn't mobilize everyone, so we also approached Auntie Qi. Auntie Qi is a very enthusiastic person who likes to help others the most. In this way, we persuaded the family members by visiting them, and they all agreed. While we were brewing this, we encountered the following event: Liu Zhenwu, a worker in the repair department, was seriously injured. He had only recently been rehired, and his wages were very low. He had a wife and a four-year-old daughter. His mother died last year, leaving him with a mountain of debt that he hadn't yet paid off. His wife had just given birth, and he had no money, so he was very distressed.
    Liu Zhenwu was on leave from work and, looking at his newborn son and his wife who needed nutrition after childbirth, and then at the half bowl of millet he had just borrowed, he paced back and forth in the room anxiously.
    At this time, we convened a meeting of all the workers' families in the dormitory, explaining the significance of organizing a mutual aid group. To our surprise, the speeches were more enthusiastic than at any previous meeting, and twenty-five people immediately signed up to join the mutual aid group. Everyone unanimously agreed to send things to help Liu's family, without expecting him to pay them back.
    In less than an hour, some were carrying basins, some were carrying bowls, some were carrying trays, with rice, white flour, millet, cornmeal, millet flour, sorghum, eggs, and even money, all sent over.
    Everyone also divided the work to take care of the mother and baby: Wang Youmei took care of the mother's diet, Wu Yuntong took care of the health of the mother and baby, Wang Chunfang cooked for Liu Zhenwu, Auntie Zhai washed clothes and diapers, the nearly sixty-year-old Sun old lady was responsible for the stove fire, Mrs. Wu took care of the mother's little girl, and Mrs. Feng ran errands.
    Liu Zhenwu saw that there was food, his wife was lying quietly in bed, and there were enthusiastic people taking care of them. He was so happy that he didn't know what to say. After a long time, he said, "This is something I never dreamed of. I don't know how to thank everyone!" The next morning, he went to work with a light step.
    A week later, Liu Zhenwu, who had been emotionally unstable, suddenly became active. Some workers were puzzled, and Liu Zhenwu told them about how the mutual aid group had helped his family. Old Liu said excitedly, "This is really extraordinary. People don't even know us, but they help us solve our difficulties. We have food, everything is safe and sound, and it hasn't interfered with work. Now I understand that such things can only happen under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I should work even harder!"
    After our mutual aid group comrades learned about this, they unanimously said, "From now on, we must strengthen our love, friendship, and mutual assistance even more."
    Sisters! The "March 8th" International Women's Day is coming, and our mutual aid group must ensure from now on: First, hold a meeting once a week to discuss methods; second, further expand the scope of our mutual aid; third, ensure that workers do not take time off work due to family affairs.

　　我们家属之间的变化
      王友梅
    我是北京石景山钢铁厂的工人家属，叫王友梅，住在本厂的宿舍金顶街众志斋里。过去我们宿舍里的家属和家属之间，时常发生吵架的事，弄得工人累了一天，晚上还得替她们调解；他们睡觉晚了，第二天上班就没有精神。这样家属的不团结就会影响了工人的生产。过去的家属也都是自管自，不管别人的事，遇到了生孩子或别的困难，没有人帮忙。就说生孩子吧，因为没人去请本厂医院的大夫，家属们就随便找个老娘婆来。有一次，一个姓冯的家属请了老娘婆来接生，差点没丧了命。像这些问题如果有工人家属互助的组织，便都能解决了。我一看，这事儿非想办法不可，就和同斋住着的吴韵桐研究这件事。现在妇女翻身了，有什么困难，都应该彼此互助来解决。虽然我们都同意这样做，可是恐怕发动不起来，于是我们又找了齐大嫂。齐大嫂是一个很热心的人，最喜欢帮人的忙。这样我们利用串门的方式向家属们进行说服，她们也都很同意。正在酝酿的时候，碰上这样一件事：有一个修理部重伤的工友刘振武，他是最近才补上的里工，他的工资很低；家里有老婆和一个四岁的女儿。去年他母亲死了，欠下了一屁股债，到现在还没还清；老婆又生了孩子，没钱，心里挺苦恼。
    刘振武歇了工，看看刚生下的儿子和产后需要营养的老婆，再看看刚借来的半碗小米，直急得在屋里来回打转。
    这时，我们召集了全斋的工人家属开了一个会，说明了组织互助小组的意义，真想不到大伙比以往任何会上的发言都热烈，当场报名参加互助组的就有二十五个人。大家一致愿意送东西帮助刘家，不要他还。
    不到一点钟的功夫，有的端着盆，有的端着碗，有的端着茶盘子，大米、白面、小米、玉米面、小米面、高粱米、鸡蛋、还有钱，都送来了。
    大家又分工照顾产妇和婴儿：王友梅照顾产妇饮食，吴韵桐照顾产妇及婴儿的健康，王春芳给刘振武做饭，翟大嫂洗衣服和尿布，将近六十岁的孙老太太负责管炉火，武太太照顾产妇的小女孩，冯太太跑腿。
    刘振武瞧见粮食有了，老婆安静地躺在床上，周围还有人热心看护，他乐得不知说什么好了。半天才说了一句：“这真是作梦也想不到的事，我不知怎样感激大家才好！”第二天早晨他踏着轻快的步子上班去了。
    一星期以后，发现情绪忽高忽低的刘振武突然积极起来了。有的工友纳闷，刘振武就把互助小组帮助他家的事说了一遍，老刘并激动地说：“这事真不平常，人家和咱又不相识，咱有困难人家就帮助解决，有了吃的，大小平安，又没误干活。现在我才明白，只有在共产党、毛主席的领导和教育下，才会有这样的事情。我应该更加劲干活！”
    我们互助小组的同志知道这事以后，一致说：“今后咱们更要加强友爱互助。”
    姐妹们！“三八”妇女节来到了，我们的互助组今后一定要保证：第一、每星期开一次会，讨论办法；第二、把我们的互助范围更加扩大；第三、保证职工不因家务事歇工。
