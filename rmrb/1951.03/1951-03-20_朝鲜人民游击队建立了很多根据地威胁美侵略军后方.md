　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The heroic Korean People's Guerrilla Units are threatening the rear of the U.S. aggression army, causing great annoyance to the enemy. A Reuters reporter accompanying the U.S. invading forces in Korea acknowledged in a dispatch on the 12th that the Korean People's Guerrilla Units, "hidden in the mountains stretching across the peninsula," are "a dangerous threat behind the United Nations forces (referring to the U.S. aggression army and its accomplice forces) fighting hard in Korea." "These scattered, infiltrated communists remain one of the biggest threats to the transportation and supply systems of the United Nations forces."

　　The reporter acknowledged that in central and eastern Korea, the Korean People's Guerrilla Units "divided into well-coordinated small teams, crossed mountains, attacked convoys and warehouses on the main supply lines in the east and center, set up roadblocks, and attacked the United Nations forces from behind," so that "in January and the first half of February, they tied down three divisions of United Nations forces that were extremely needed on the front lines." In southwestern Korea, the Korean People's Guerrilla Units "operated in groups of five to five hundred people." They established many guerrilla bases "about ten miles square" and established people's power.

　　The Reuters reporter said that some military observers estimate that it would take two army corps to deal with these guerrillas. The reporter then added: "It can be asserted that as long as there is war in Korea, there will be guerrillas."

　　朝鲜人民游击队建立了很多根据地威胁美侵略军后方
    【新华社十六日讯】英勇作战的朝鲜人民游击队，威胁着美国侵略军的后方，使敌人极感烦恼。路透社随侵朝美军记者在十二日发出的电讯中承认：“隐藏在绵延于半岛上的山里”的朝鲜人民游击队，是“在朝鲜苦战的联合国军队（按即美国侵略军及其帮凶军）后面”的“一种危险的威胁”。“这些分散的、渗入的共军，仍然是联合国军队的交通系统和补给系统的最大的威胁之一。”
    该记者承认：在朝鲜中部和东部，朝鲜人民游击部队“分成配合得很好的小队，翻山越岭，袭击东部、中部主要补给线上的运输队和仓库，建立路障，从背后袭击联合国军队”，以致“在一月间和二月上半月，牵制了战线上极为需要的三师联合国军队”。在朝鲜西南部分，朝鲜人民游击队“分成五人至五百人的小组进行活动”。他们建立了许多约“十英里见方的”游击根据地，并建立了人民政权。
    路透社记者说：某些军事观察家估计需要两个兵团陆军来对付这些游击队。该记者接着又说：“可以断言的是：只要朝鲜一天有战事，就一天有游击队。”
