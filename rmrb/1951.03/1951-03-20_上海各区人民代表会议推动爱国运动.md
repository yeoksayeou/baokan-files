Shanghai's districts held their first All-Circles People's Representative Conferences from December 27th of last year to March 3rd of this year. The convocation of these district People's Representative Conferences played a significant role in educating and uniting the city's people to deeply develop the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and carry out land reform in the suburban areas, and it also advanced the democratic construction work in Shanghai.

A total of 6,021 representatives attended the All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in the city's thirty districts. The method of selecting these representatives, in addition to the representatives of the People's Government and specially invited representatives, was through consultation and election by various people's organizations and democratic parties.

The district conferences received many proposals regarding the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement. The representatives from all circles earnestly discussed these proposals, formulated All-Circles People's Patriotic Pacts for Resist America, Aid Korea, and unanimously pledged to deeply develop this patriotic movement in all their work. At the All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in Jiangwan, Penglai, and seven other districts, representatives from all circles unanimously denounced the atrocities of the Japanese imperialist invasion and firmly expressed their opposition to the United States rearming Japan. Worker representatives from the industrial districts of Yangshupu and Putuo wrote their patriotic production pacts, item by item, on congratulatory banners and presented them to the conference, resolutely stating: they vowed to show their love for the motherland by doing a good job in production. At the All-Circles People's Representative Conference in Xincheng District, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors formulated specific measures to combat tax evasion and tax arrears, and mobilized more than 500 tax-delinquent households to collectively pay off their tax arrears.

The All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in the twenty urban districts focused on discussing the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Worker, student, neighborhood resident representatives, and representatives of martyrs' families used their personal experiences of being persecuted by secret agents to accuse and expose the various sabotage activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in factories, schools, and neighborhoods, greatly raising the vigilance of people from all walks of life. Some representatives reported secret agents who were still carrying out sabotage activities. At many district All-Circles People's Representative Conferences, representatives from all circles separately formulated "Anti-Espionage Patriotic Pacts," guaranteeing to assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and assisting the People's Government in doing a good job in the current registration of reactionary party, league, and secret agent personnel. Worker representatives proposed: to strengthen worker organizations, expand worker pickets, protect factories, and prevent sabotage by secret agents. Neighborhood resident representatives and industrial and commercial representatives proposed: not to listen to secret agent rumors, not to hide secret agents, and to report secret agents to the People's Government at any time. Representatives from cultural and educational circles proposed: to always do a good job in propaganda and education against American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

The All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in the ten suburban districts all focused on land reform as the central topic. After the rent reduction movement, the awareness of suburban peasants was raised, and they demanded the implementation of land reform one after another. When accusing the landlords of their crimes, peasant representatives from Jiangwan District said: The landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries are of one mind, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the American imperialists are of one mind, and they are all preventing us from living a good life. The district conferences all specifically studied the Shanghai Suburban Land Reform Implementation Measures and unanimously resolved to complete land reform before and after the spring plowing. Worker, student, and cultural and educational representatives from Wusong, Jiangwan, and other districts actively signed up to participate in land reform work teams to assist peasants in carrying out land reform.

The thirty district All-Circles People's Representative Conferences received a total of 29,329 proposals, of which proposals on residents' welfare issues (including municipal construction, culture and education, and health) accounted for 46 percent of the total number of proposals. The district People's Representative Conferences discussed these proposals. Based on the opinions of people from all districts and all walks of life, the Municipal People's Government decided that municipal construction should first take care of industrial areas and gradually improve the city's environmental sanitation and strengthen epidemic prevention facilities.

The People's Representatives of all circles in all districts listened to the work reports of the District People's Government, and after group discussions, put forward many sincere criticisms and suggestions on the work of the District People's Government. Consultation committees of the People's Representatives of all circles in all districts were established in all thirty districts of the city.

　　上海各区人民代表会议推动爱国运动
    上海市各区自去年十二月二十七日到今年三月三日先后举行了首次各界人民代表会议。这次区人民代表会议的召开，对于教育与团结全市人民深入开展抗美援朝爱国运动、镇压反革命活动和进行郊区土地改革，都起了很大的推动作用，并使上海市民主建政工作向前推进了一步。
    全市三十个区的各界人民代表会议，出席代表共计六千零二十一人。这些代表产生的方法，除人民政府代表及特邀代表以外，都是由各人民团体、各民主党派协商选举的。
    各区会议都收到了很多关于开展抗美援朝爱国运动的提案。各界代表认真讨论了这些提案，分别制成了各界人民抗美援朝爱国公约，一致保证要在各项工作中深入开展这一爱国运动。在江湾、蓬莱等九个区各界人民代表会议上，各界代表一致控诉了日寇侵略暴行，坚决表示反对美国重新武装日本。杨树浦、普陀等工业区的工人代表，把他们的爱国生产公约逐条写在贺幛上献给会议，并坚决表示：誓以搞好生产来表示他们对祖国的热爱。新成区各界人民代表会议上，工商界代表拟定了反逃税反欠税的具体办法，并动员了五百余户欠税户集体缴清了欠税。
    市区二十个区的各界人民代表会议，着重地讨论了镇压反革命的问题。工人、学生、里弄居民代表及烈士家属代表，均以亲身遭受特务迫害的事实，在会上控诉和揭露了美蒋特务在工厂、学校、里弄内的各种破坏活动，大大提高了各界人民的警惕性。有的代表检举了还在继续进行破坏活动的特务分子。不少区的各界人民代表会议上，各界代表分别订立了“反特爱国公约”，保证协助人民政府镇压反革命，协助人民政府作好当前对于反动党团特务人员的登记工作。工人代表提出：要加强工人组织，壮大工人纠察队，保护工厂，防止特务破坏。里弄居民代表及工商界代表提出：不听信特务谣言，不隐藏特务，随时向人民政府检举特务。文教界代表提出：随时作好反对美蒋特务的宣传教育工作。
    十个郊区的各界人民代表会议都以土地改革为中心议题。郊区农民经过减租运动以后，觉悟提高，纷纷要求实行土地改革。江湾区农民代表在控诉地主罪恶时说：地主和国民党反动派一条心，国民党反动派和美帝国主义一条心，他们都是不让我们过好日子的。各区会议都具体研究了上海市郊区土地改革实施办法，一致决议在春耕前后完成土地改革。吴淞、江湾等区的工人、学生、文教界代表纷纷报名参加土地改革工作队，协助农民进行土地改革。
    三十个区各界人民代表会议共计收到提案两万九千三百二十九件，其中关于居民福利问题（包括市政建设、文教、卫生）的提案占总提案数的百分之四十六。各区人民代表会议对于这些提案都进行了讨论。根据各区各界人民的意见，市人民政府确定今后市政建设首先照顾到工业区，并逐步改善全市环境卫生，加强防疫设施。
    各区各界人民代表都听取了区人民政府的工作报告，并经过分组讨论，对区人民政府的各项工作提出了许多诚恳的批评和建议。全市三十个区都成立了区各界人民代表会议协商委员会。
    由于各区会议决议的贯彻执行，一个空前规模的爱国运动正在全市深入展开。三月五日和三月八日，全市有六十六万工人和三十万妇女，先后举行了反对美国重新武装日本的示威大游行。全市工商业户，绝大部分缴清了欠税。在各界人民的规劝、教育及检举下，全市已有两万多反动党团特务人员向人民政府履行登记。郊区已有五分之二的乡开始了土地改革。
