Xinhua News Agency, March 8th—The debate within the American ruling clique regarding invasion routes continues in the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees’ hearings on the issue of sending American troops to Europe. These hearings were held continuously from February 15th to 28th.

Before the hearings, Senator William Knowland, the Republican leader in the Senate and a representative of those opposing the Truman administration's current invasion route, introduced a proposal in Congress stipulating that Truman should not send any more troops to Western Europe until Congress decides on a "policy." At the hearings, former President Hoover and Senator Robert Taft, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, spoke in support of Knowland's proposal. Outside of the hearings, the National Federation of Independent Business, an organization of American capitalists, also notified Congress of its support for Knowland's proposal. Supporters of the Knowland proposal are very fearful of the disasters that will result from the continued deployment of American troops in Europe. Hoover said, "Sending the army to Europe at present is a step into the unknown." Knowland himself said that sending American troops to Europe now is a "foolish adventure." Taft, in addition to considering sending more American troops to Europe as "very dangerous," was even more worried that the huge army that would have to be maintained as a result would "bring about ruinous inflation."

However, neither Knowland, nor Hoover, nor Taft, these imperialist aggressors, have given up their intention of using Western Europe as an advanced base for aggression. Their advocacy of temporarily not increasing troops also has such a purpose, namely to coerce the Western European puppet states to accelerate their military expansion, so as to serve as the main supplier of cannon fodder for America's bloody aggression plan. Hoover attacked the Western European countries for not "establishing sufficient defenses" on land. Taft openly advocated that the United States should not send more troops until the Western European countries agree to provide sufficient troops. He threatened the Western European countries, saying, "If the Europeans do not provide most of the troops, and show most of the concern and initiative, and indeed take on more responsibility, then we cannot help them."

The Hoover, Taft, and Knowland-style invasion route was fiercely opposed by officials of the Truman administration at the hearings. Secretary of Defense Marshall, Secretary of State Acheson, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force successively "testified" at the meeting. This group of warmongers worried that intimidating the ruling groups of Western European countries, which are now filled with defeatism, with Taft-like tactics would not be effective and might instead cause even greater panic. Marshall said during his "testimony" that this would "weaken the morale of our allies." General Bradley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, advocated "sending more troops abroad immediately." But what troops could be sent "immediately"? Bradley did not say. And what is the future of resolving to do so? Even Acheson, such a die-hard aggressor, had to admit that it was "likely to take some risks."

### 美帝国主义兵力不足又在争吵侵略路线问题

　　美帝国主义兵力不足又在争吵侵略路线问题
    【新华社八日讯】美国统治集团内部关于侵略路线问题的争吵，在参院外交及军事两委员会为辩论派遣美国陆军赴欧问题而举行的意见听取会上继续展开着，这一会议自二月十五日至二十八日连续举行。
    在会议之前，反对杜鲁门政府现行侵略路线的代表人物之一、参院共和党领袖惠利，曾在国会提出一项提案，规定杜鲁门在国会尚未决定“政策”之前，不得再派军队到西欧去。在这次意见听取会上，前总统胡佛、参院共和党政策委员会主席塔夫脱等都曾发言，支持惠利的这一提案。在会外，美国资本家的组织全国独立企业联合会亦通知国会，支持惠利的提案。惠利提案的拥护者十分恐惧美国继续派兵进据欧洲所将招致的灾难。胡佛说：“目前派遣陆军去欧洲，是走向不可知的险境。”惠利本人说：现在派遣美军赴欧是“愚蠢的冒险”。塔夫脱除了认为派遣更多的美军到欧洲去是“很危险的”之外，更担心因此而必须维持的庞大陆军“会带来招致灭亡的通货膨胀”。
    可是，不论是惠利、或者是胡佛、或者是塔夫脱，这些帝国主义侵略分子，丝毫也没有放弃把西欧作为侵略前哨的意图。他们主张暂不增兵也具有这样的目的，即胁迫西欧仆从国家加速扩军，以作为美国血腥侵略计划的主要炮灰供给者。胡佛曾攻击西欧各国没有在陆上“建立充分的防务”。塔夫脱更公开主张在西欧国家答应提供足够的军队之前，美国不要派出更多的军队。他威胁西欧国家说：“如果欧洲人不提供大部分军队，并且表现大部分的关怀与主动，确实承担更多的责任，那末，我们就爱莫能助了。”
    胡佛、塔夫脱及惠利式的侵略路线，在意见听取会上遭到杜鲁门政府官员的激烈反对。国防部长马歇尔、国务卿艾奇逊以及陆、海、空军参谋长都相继到会上“作证”。这一群战争贩子担心：对于现在弥漫着失败主义的西欧各国统治集团，如果再用塔夫脱那样的恫吓手段，将不会有效，反而可能引起更大的恐慌。马歇尔在“作证”时说：这样会“削弱我们盟友的士气”。美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷主张“立刻派更多的军队到海外去”。但是，“立刻”有什么军队可派去呢？布莱德雷没有说。而决心这样做的前途又怎样呢？连艾奇逊这样死硬的侵略分子，也不得不承认是“可能冒些险”的。
