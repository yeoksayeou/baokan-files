　　Facilitate Cargo Owners and Promote Material Exchange
    Ministry of Railways Decides to Implement Responsible Transportation Services
    The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has decided to implement responsible transportation services among 331 major railway stations nationwide starting April 1st. Beginning July 1st, responsible transportation services will be universally implemented at all stations nationwide. After the implementation of responsible transportation, cargo owners who consign full carload shipments to the railway will no longer need to manage and escort the goods themselves, and the railway will be fully responsible. This measure not only greatly facilitates cargo owners in transporting goods but also reduces transportation costs for cargo owners, which is very beneficial for promoting material exchange between regions. In the past, due to insufficient equipment and conditions, the railway only handled less-than-carload shipments. Since last year, railway transport order has been normalized, and transport equipment has increased compared to before, so it is now possible to implement responsible transportation services.

　　便利货主促进物资交流
    铁道部决定举办负责运输业务
    中央人民政府铁道部决定自四月一日起先在全国铁路三百三十一个主要车站间举办负责运输业务。从七月一日开始，将在全国各站普遍举办负责运输业务。实行负责运输后，货主交铁路运输的整车货物就不须自己保管和押运，完全交由铁路负责。这一措施不但对货主运货有很大便利，并且可为货主减低货物的运输成本，这对于促进各地物资交流很有好处。过去铁路上由于设备和条件不够，只负责运输零担货物。去年以来，铁路运输秩序已经正常，运输设备较前增加，因此已可能举办负责运输业务。（新华社）
