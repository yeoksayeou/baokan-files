　　Land Reform Makes the Countryside Vibrant
　　——A Record of Liberated Yueyang Peasants
　　Luo Guangshang
　　　　　　Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　The people of Yueyang know best what the taste of imperialist aggression is. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese devils occupied Yueyang several times, raping, plundering, and killing, and even old women in their sixties and seventies were not spared. Even now, broken walls and ruined fields can still be seen everywhere. Therefore, when the news that American imperialism was about to attack the Chinese border and arm Japan reached the countryside, many farmers in Yueyang villages launched angry accusations against the bloody atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Fang Qingsheng, a 68-year-old farmhand in Xinmin Township, tearfully recounted at a township-wide meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants how the Japanese burned down his house, beat his eldest son to death, and crippled his second son. The landlord, Fang Zhushan, took the opportunity to press for debts, leaving him almost ruined. He immediately mobilized his third son to enlist in the army on the spot, and instructed his son to "avenge your father and brother." Many family members of Liberation Army soldiers also expressed after the accusations: "Country first, then family! We have suffered all our lives, and now we have been given land by Chairman Mao and want to live a good life. We should find ways to protect it ourselves. We must never live the life of a subjugated slave!" In some places, farmers initiated comfort campaigns for the Chinese People's Volunteers, and many farmers saved thousands of yuan from their oil and salt money to donate to the volunteers. The liberated peasant women of Dacheng Township even worked through the night to make 100 pairs of military shoes to comfort the troops.
　　The liberated peasants take better care of the soldiers' families. After the land reform, all townships have arranged for substitute farming. When Dacheng Township in the Second District was discussing the issue of spring plowing production, it was discovered that several military families had no labor force at all. Several peasant association groups immediately agreed to contract for them, and the peasant association also guaranteed them. The peasants have closely linked defending the motherland with their own liberated interests.
　　　　　　Working for Themselves
　　After the peasants were given their own land, their enthusiasm for production immediately flourished. Within more than a month after the completion of land reform in the Second District, 623 ponds and five dams were repaired, and 21 new large ponds were built. On average, more than 20,000 people participated in the work every day throughout the district. When the weather is good, liberated peasants can be seen everywhere happily repairing their own ponds and dams. Some carry soil, some carry stones, and most of them do it together with their families. Many ponds and dams that had not been repaired for many years have been renovated. Luohe Village in Wenfaxiang originally had 206 households. In the past, there were very few ponds and dams. When there was a drought, the peasants could only envy other villages for having good ponds, but because they were mostly planting tenant land at that time, they were afraid that it would not last long, so they did not dare to repair them, and often had to watch the rice seedlings die. This time, the peasants were given land, and the government also provided loans, and the peasants' production enthusiasm was improved, so they began to repair them in a big way. All 764 people in the village repaired 12 old ponds and opened 2 new ponds, which can irrigate 334 mu of land. When building the Hu family's large pond, a farmer surnamed He exclaimed: "I wanted to build such a pond ten years ago, and today I finally got my wish!" The peasants in Xinhe Township more affectionately called their work "repairing the ponds for future generations, so that future generations can also turn over!"
　　After the Provincial People's Government issued instructions to encourage cotton planting, it brought more joy to the peasants of Yueyang. Many people plan to change the "high bank fields" (i.e., dry land) that used to grow rice and other miscellaneous grains to cotton. When the peasants in the Second District discussed the issue of spring plowing at the district peasant representative meeting, the representative of Wenhua Township proposed to guarantee the expansion of cotton fields by 700 mu; the representative of Dacheng Township immediately proposed to guarantee the expansion of 1,000 mu; the entire district can expand cotton fields by more than 3,000 mu (there were originally 19,000 mu last year). According to the calculation of 40 catties of seed cotton per mu (this is the general standard for cotton production in Yueyang), the Second District alone can increase the income of 120,000 catties of cotton this year. Of course, the Ninth District, which produces more cotton, will not only have this number. Therefore, Xu Huilin, chairman of the Gangkou Township Peasant Association, pointed to that large area of cotton fields with confidence and said: "As long as the price of cotton is good, the number of people planting it will definitely increase year by year. Come and see again in two years and it will be different again."
　　Some rich peasants and middle peasants still have concerns about production, and the peasants automatically enlighten them. Fan Sixiu, a women's committee member of Gangkou Township, found that the rich peasants He Erdie and Xu Hantao, who lived in the same courtyard (natural village), were unsettled in production because they heard rumors that "the landlords will be changed to rich peasants after the landlords are changed," so she automatically went to talk to them. She sincerely said to them: "Don't listen to rumors, that is absolutely impossible. The government stipulates that there is only one land reform. No matter how rich you middle peasants and rich peasants become in the future, it will be your own. Don't believe the words of bad elements and badmouth the policies of the People's Government!" Then she compared the fact that some people initially spread rumors that the fruits of struggle would be handed over to the government in the future and not distributed to the peasants, and now they know that the government did not want a penny, to them; to make them believe in the government's policies. The next day, these two families began to send manure to the fields. After some rich peasants and middle peasants eliminated their concerns, they also automatically said to the poor and lower-middle peasants: "As long as everyone turns over, we can lend you whatever farm tools you lack in production." At the same time, the peasants also began to carry out labor reform on landlords and loafers. Xu Guangfa and Li Guanghua, poor peasants in Shuangfeng Village, Gangkou Township, used to eat "easy meals." They were still playing cards outside and not going home during the busy farming season. This year, under the education of the peasant association, it is very different. When repairing the dike, they both got up before dawn every day and urged people to go to work, more active than anyone else, saying, "I must strive to be a good element this time. If I fall behind again, I won't be human." Tan Hongtao, a landlord who used to be a puppet county magistrate, is now building ponds and dams with the peasants every day under the strict control of the peasants, and the number of times he carries soil is increasing day by day.
　　Recently, the Changsha Commissioner's Office has also loaned rice seeds to the peasants, so everyone's confidence is even higher.
　　　　　　Own Armed Forces
　　The militia is a strong force in the land reform. They have supervised the activities of landlords, protected the property of the people, and prevented bandits and secret agents from sabotaging... to consolidate and protect their own fruits of liberation in all aspects. Li Liangchu, the biggest local tyrant landlord in Zhulun Township, ran away, and the peasants anxiously inquired about the news from all sides, because he owed them a lot of blood debts. Later, they finally got a clue from another fleeing landlord, Li Pingbo. Eight militiamen volunteered to set off overnight. When they arrived at their destination, the sky was just beginning to light up. In the hazy morning, they saw a man bending over and chopping firewood on the top of a mountain not far away. When they got closer, they realized that it was Li Liangchu they were looking for. As soon as Li Liangchu saw them, he took the lead and knocked the two people in front of him to the ground (Li had learned martial arts). He then jumped down the hillside and rolled into a cave at the bottom of the cliff and ran away. The eight militiamen followed and chased down. At that time, it was snowing heavily, and they followed their footprints and chased for more than 30 li in one breath, shouting along the way: "Catch the local tyrant landlord." At this time, it was cold and the road was slippery. Several people's toes were bleeding, but they were determined to "not go home until Li Liangchu is caught." Because of their shouting, they alarmed the peasants in the Seventh District (Zhulun Township is in the Fourth District). The militiamen came out one after another with spears and immediately gathered more than 300 people. After searching everywhere, they finally caught him in a small hut under the Dashudong Mountain.
　　　　　　Review Meeting
　　Liu Xiangfan, a peasant in Gangkou Township who was not very aware, once hid a fleeing landlord from the Second District in his home for one night. Later, it was discovered by the militia. In addition to sending the landlord back to his original township for processing, a group meeting was held immediately for review. At the meeting, everyone criticized him, saying: "You have been given land and fruits, and you have turned over. But you shouldn't just turn over yourself and not care about others." When Liu Xiangfan heard everyone criticize him like this, he thought about it carefully and felt that it was wrong, so he immediately blushed and criticized himself, saying: "I really shouldn't have done that. I forgot the root. I will never do this again!" At the same time, the group leaders also made self-criticisms, feeling that they had not educated Liu Xiangfan enough on weekdays. For some lazy people and loafers, transformation is often carried out through this kind of criticism and self-criticism. The peasants said to them: "The People's Government likes diligent people. If you are lazy, no one will even beg you for food in the future. If you are willing to be diligent, everyone can help you if you lack anything." The review meeting resolved many disputes, large and small, in the countryside, and also helped the peasants to continuously improve.
　　　　　　Cultural and Recreational Activities
　　In the land reform, all districts in Yueyang County have focused on running winter schools. The 40 winter schools run by the Second District have also combined to form reading groups. When discussing current affairs, some peasants who do not attend winter schools also come to listen to the lectures. Winter schools have greatly promoted the work. Especially in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, many winter school students have played a backbone role in many places. The peasants' enthusiasm for learning is quite high. In a winter school in Zhao Village, Yuexi Township, there is a 64-year-old female student, Liao Yuzhen. No matter whether it is windy or rainy, she has never been absent or late. She often says to other students: "Learn until you are old, you can't finish learning." Therefore, other students in the winter school proposed to learn from Liao Yuzhen. This 64-year-old woman has become a literacy model in the winter school.
　　Peasants in many places have also organized Yangko teams. Whenever there are festivals or happy events worth celebrating in the village, teams of Yangko dancers come out of various courtyards. Many young couples participate together; when young women return to their parents' homes, they often happily dance on the way.

### 土地改革把农村变得有声有色——记翻了身的岳阳农民

　　土地改革把农村变得有声有色
    ——记翻了身的岳阳农民
    罗光裳
            抗美援朝运动
    帝国主义的侵略是什么味道，岳阳的人民最清楚。抗战时期，日本鬼子几次侵占岳阳，奸淫烧杀，连六、七十岁的老婆婆也不能幸免，直到现在还随处可以看到断垣残壁和荒芜了的田亩。因此当美国帝国主义要打到中国边境和武装日本的消息传到农村后，岳阳很多乡村里的农民便都掀起了对日寇血腥暴行的愤怒控诉。新民乡一位六十八岁的老雇农方庆生在全乡的贫雇农大会上声泪俱下地诉说了日本人来时烧掉他的房子，打死他的大儿子，害得他二儿子也成了残废，地主方竹山又乘机逼债，弄得他几乎家破人亡的事情以后，便立刻动员他的三儿子当场报名参军，还嘱咐他儿子“去为你父亲和哥哥报仇”。很多解放军战士的家属在控诉以后也都表示：“先有国，后有家！苦了一世，如今搭伴毛主席分了田，要过好日子了，我们自己就更应该想办法来好好保护它。亡国奴的日子是一定过不得的了！”有些地方的农民发起慰劳中国人民志愿军，很多农民从油盐钱里面省下几千元来捐献给志愿军。大成乡的翻身农妇还自动连夜赶制了军鞋一百双来慰劳军队。
    翻了身的农民对战士们的家属照顾得更周到。土地改革后的各乡都已布置了代耕工作，二区大成乡在研究春耕生产的问题时，发现几户完全没有劳动力的军属，几个农民协会小组当场就一口应承代他们包耕，农会也给他们作了保证。农民已经把保卫祖国和自己的翻身利益紧紧地结合在一起了。
            为自己劳动
    农民分得了自己的土地之后，生产热情便立刻蓬勃生长起来。二区完成土地改革以后，一个多月以内便修好了六百二十三口塘、五座坝，还新建了二十一口大塘。全区每天平均有二万多人参加工作。天气好的时候，到处可以看到翻身农民在兴高采烈地修整自己的塘坝。有的担土，有的抬石头，而且多半是全家男女一起动手。很多年久不修的塘坝都从新兴修起来。文发乡罗何村原共有二百零六户人家，以前塘坝很少，一到干旱的时候，农民只有羡慕别村有好塘，但因为那个时候大都是种的佃田，怕种不长久，所以又都不敢修，只得常常望着禾苗活活干死。这次农民分了田，政府又贷了款，农民生产情绪提高，便大修起来了。全村七百六十四人，共修好旧塘十二口，新开塘二口，能灌田三百三十四亩。在修建胡家大塘时，一个姓何的农民曾感叹地说：“还是十年以前，就想过要修咯样一口塘，到今天总算如愿了！”新河乡的农民在修塘时，更亲切地称呼自己的工作说是“修子孙塘，翻身要连子孙都翻过来！”
    省人民政府发布鼓励种棉的指示以后，给岳阳农民带来了更多的喜悦。很多人都计划把以前种稻和种其他杂粮的“高岸田”（即旱田）一律改成种棉花。二区的农民在区农民代表会上讨论春耕问题的时候，文华乡的代表提出保证扩大棉田七百亩；大成乡的代表立刻就提出保证扩大一千亩；全区共计能扩大棉田三千多亩（去年原有一万九千亩）。按照一亩田收四十斤皮花计算（这是岳阳产棉的一般标准），光只二区今年就能增收十二万斤棉花，要是在产棉更多的九区，当然更不止这个数目了。因此筻口乡的乡农民协会主席许惠林曾满怀信心地指着那一大片棉田说：“只要棉花价钱好，保险一年比一年种的人会更加多起来，过两年再来看看就又不同了。”
    有些富农、中农对生产还存有顾虑的，农民便自动给他们打通思想、筻口乡妇女委员樊四秀，发觉他同屋场（自然村）住的富农何二爹、许汉涛，因听了谣言说“改了地主改富农”，生产不安心，便自动去找他们谈话。她对他们诚恳地说：“你们不要听谣言，咯是绝对冒得的事。政府规定了土地改革只有一次，不管中农、富农以后你们发了财都是自己的。快莫信坏分子的话，把人民政府的政策讲坏了！”接着她又把最初有人造谣说将来斗争果实都要交给政府，不分给农民，现在就知道政府连一个角都没有要的事情比喻给他们听；要他们相信政府的政策。第二天这两户人家就开始往地里送粪了。有些富农和中农顾虑消除后，还自动和贫雇农说：“只要大家翻了身，你们生产里面缺少些什么农具东西，我们可以借给你。”农民们同时对地主和二流子也开始进行了劳动改造。筻口乡双枫村的贫农许光发和李光华过去专吃“松活饭”，农忙的时候还在外面打牌不归屋。今年在农会的教育下，就不同得多了，修堤的时候，他们二个人每天冒天亮就起来，还到外面催人上工，比任何人都积极，说“咯下硬要争取作个好分子。再落后也不是人了。”曾经作过伪县长的地主谈洪涛在农民的严格管制下，现在每天也和农民在一起修建塘坝，而且一天比一天担土的次数也加多起来。
    最近长沙专员公署又给农民贷了禾种，因此，大家的信心就更高了。
            自己的武装
    民兵是土地改革中一支坚强的力量，他们曾监视地主活动，保护人民财产，防止土匪和特务破坏……从各方面来巩固和保卫自己的翻身果实。朱仑乡一个最大的恶霸地主李良初跑了，农民焦急地从各方面打听消息，因为他欠了他们不少血债。后来终于在另一个逃亡地主李平伯那里得到了线索，八个民兵便自告奋勇连夜出发，走到目的地时，天才开始有点儿亮，蒙蒙中看见不远的山顶上有一个人在弯着腰砍柴，走近一看原来就是他们要找的李良初。李良初一见他们，便先下手把前面的两个人打翻在地下（李曾经学过拳术），自己则从山坡上往下一跳滚到山崖底下的一个洞里跑了。八个民兵也跟着追下去。那时正下着白茫茫的大雪，他们便步着脚迹一口气追了三十几里，同时沿途大喊：“捉恶霸地主”。这时天又冷，路又滑，好几个人的脚趾都跌出血来了，但他们都下定决心“不捉住李良初誓不回家”，由于他们呼喊，便惊动了七区的农民（朱仑乡是四区的），民兵们都纷纷拿着梭镖跑了出来，一下子就集合了三百多人，到处一搜，终于在大树洞山下一个小茅屋捉到了。
            检讨会
    筻口乡一个觉悟不高的农民刘湘凡，有次藏了二区一个逃亡地主在家里住了一夜，后来被民兵发觉了，除了将那个地主送回原乡处理以外，紧接着召开了小组会检讨。在会上大家都批评他说：“你分了田，分了果实，你是翻身了，但是你不应该只要自己翻了身，就不管人家了。”刘湘凡听到大家都这样批评他，仔细想了想，也觉得很不对，便立刻面红耳赤地自己批评自己说：“我真的太不应该了，我忘了根本，以后我再也不这样了！”同时，小组长们也互相作了检讨，觉得自己平日对刘湘凡还教育得不够。对于一些懒汉、二流子也常常是通过这种批评与自我批评来进行改造的。农民对他们说：“人民政府喜欢勤快人，你要是懒，将来讨饭都冒人把，要是你肯习勤快，就是缺少些什么，大家还可以帮帮忙。”检讨会上解决了农村中大大小小的许多纠纷，也帮助着农民不断地进步。
            文化娱乐活动
    岳阳县各区在土地改革中都曾有重点地开办了冬学。二区办的四十个冬学中还结合着成立了读报组，讲有关时事问题的时候，有些不念冬学的农民也跑来听课。冬学对工作的推动是很大的，特别是在抗美援朝运动中，很多地方的冬学学生都起了骨干作用。农民的学习热情都相当高。粤西乡街赵村一个冬学里，有位六十四岁的女学生廖宇贞，无论刮风下雨，从来没有缺过席或迟到过，还常常对其他同学说：“学到老，学不了”，因此冬学里的其他学生都提出向廖宇贞看齐的口号，这位六十四岁的老太太就成了冬学里的识字模范。
    许多地方的农民又组织了秧歌队，逢到节日或村子里有什么值得祝贺的喜事，一队队的秧歌便从各个屋场里扭出来。很多年青夫妇都是两口子同时参加；青年妇女们回娘家时，也常常高兴得在半路上扭起来。
