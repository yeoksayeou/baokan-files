Xinhua News Agency, 6th: To organize the national exchange of native produce and formulate the 1951 native produce management plan, the third joint conference of managers of the China Native Produce Company Head Office, held in Tianjin, concluded on March 4. Attending the meeting were the president and vice presidents of the China Native Produce Company, heads of various departments and sections, and managers of native produce companies from major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, totaling 97 people. In attendance were representatives from relevant departments of the Central People's Government and responsible personnel from the planning, finance, and export departments of native produce companies from various regions, provinces, and cities, totaling 93 people. The meeting heard work reports from native produce companies in various regions, summarized the purchasing and sales work of the China Native Produce Company in 1950, heard reports from Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Trade, and Sha Qianli, Deputy Minister of Trade, of the Central People's Government, on the price policies and management work of state-owned trading companies, and formulated the native produce management plan for 1951.

The meeting, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, decided that in 1951, the China Native Produce Company should, on the basis of the work achievements of 1950, implement the native produce management policy of focusing on expanding domestic sales, vigorously rely on cooperatives, organize private merchants, and actively promote the sales of various native produce. In terms of the business operations of native produce companies, the focus nationwide should be on managing four important means of industrial and agricultural production: hemp, tobacco leaves, bean cake, and fertilizer powder. In addition, provincial and municipal companies must also manage various native products according to local people's needs and their own management capabilities, adapting to local conditions. The meeting decided to implement the decision of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to vigorously develop material exchange and invigorate the urban and rural economy by vigorously promoting sales, strengthening business management, and accelerating capital turnover, and gradually achieve the enterprise-like management of native produce companies.

During the meeting, the attending representatives carefully discussed the mutual exchange of important native products from various regions, and 54 agreements for the exchange of native products between regions, provinces, and cities were concluded during the meeting. Through these agreements, more than 160 kinds of native products will be exchanged domestically, totaling more than 180 million jin (native products counted in units other than jin, such as boxes, bundles, etc., are not included), which is equivalent to about 50 percent of the total value of commodities managed by the China Native Produce Company in 1950.

[Our Newspaper] At the third managers' meeting of the China Native Produce Company, six major regions, Northeast, North China, Central South, East China, Southwest, Northwest, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, signed native produce exchange agreements between regions and regions, provinces and provinces, and provinces and cities.

The native produce exchange agreements stipulate that the quantities and types of goods flowing in and out between the regions are very large and diverse. From East China to Southwest China, there are seven types of native produce, including sea cucumber, dried shrimp, sea crab, and medicinal materials, totaling 164,000 jin; to Central South China, there are 19 types, including alum and ham, totaling 775,000 jin; to North China and Northwest China, there are 29 types, including alum, sea cucumber, and bamboo ware, totaling 2,526,000 jin; and to Northeast China, there are 25 types, including brown sugar and bamboo ware, totaling 6 million jin. From Southwest China to East China, Central South, Southwest, and North China, there are 54 types of native produce, including pickled mustard tuber, tung oil, gallnuts, medicinal materials, and native tobacco leaves, totaling more than 17.6 million jin. From North China to Central South, Northeast, and Northwest China, there are 50 types of native produce, including medicinal materials, vermicelli, chestnuts, peppercorns, red dates, and black dates, totaling more than 11.1 million jin. From Northeast China to Central South, East China, and North China, there are more than 20 types of native produce, including lard, soybean oil, fruits, medicinal materials, cattle, and donkeys, totaling more than 4.38 million jin. From Northwest China to Central South, North China, East China, and Southwest China, there are 40 types of native produce, including wood ear fungus, raw lacquer, dried apricots, and raisins, totaling more than 3.1 million jin. From Inner Mongolia to East China, Central South, and North China, there are more than 10 types of native produce, including apricot kernels, melon seeds, natural alkali, cream, and bitter almonds, totaling more than 1.1 million jin.

This unprecedented large-scale exchange of native produce not only makes the exchange of native produce gradually move towards planning but, more importantly, allows native produce that was stagnant or even abandoned in various regions to regain the market, solves the sales problem of native produce for millions of farmers, provides the needed supply of native produce to those who need it, and further unites private merchants to jointly do a good job in developing the domestic market. For example, the Moutai liquor, cinnabar, flakes of cinnabar, silver ear fungus, and realgar produced in remote Guizhou, which were originally difficult to sell, now have sales outlets. The yellow tobacco and flax from Songjiang, Northeast China, had no sales in the past, while the interior urgently needed them, and this exchange has solved both problems.

This nationwide exchange of materials is a victorious beginning to the development of domestic trade, but there are still many difficulties ahead. If governments and Party committees at all levels can earnestly lead and assist local native produce companies, fulfill agreements and contracts, and maintain credibility, it will certainly promote the smooth development of national material exchange and create favorable conditions for the recovery and development of industry and agriculture.

　　中国土产公司经理会议闭幕
    决开展全国性土产大交流
    各地协议交换土产达一亿八千余万斤  将依靠合作社组织私商大量进行推销
    【新华社六日讯】为了组织全国土产交流，制定一九五一年的土产经营计划，中国土产公司总公司在天津召开的第三次经理联席会议已于三月四日结束。出席会议的有中国土产公司正、副经理，各处各科负责人，各大行政区、各省、各市土产公司的经理等共九十七人，列席的有中央人民政府各有关部门的代表和各区、各省、各市土产公司的计划、财务、出口部门的负责人员等共九十三人。会议听取了各区土产公司的工作汇报，总结了一九五○年中国土产公司的购销工作，听取了政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任、中央人民政府贸易部叶季壮部长和沙千里副部长关于国营贸易公司的价格政策和经营管理工作的报告，制定了一九五一年度的土产经营计划。
    会议根据中央人民政府贸易部的指示，决定一九五一年中国土产公司要在一九五○年工作成绩的基础上，贯彻以扩大内销为主的土产经营方针，大力依靠合作社，组织私商，积极推销各种土产；在土产公司的业务经营方面，在全国范围内以经营麻、烟叶、豆饼、肥田粉等四种重要的工、农业生产资料为主，此外，各省、市公司并须根据当地人民需要和自身经营能力，因地制宜地经营各种土产。会议决定以大力推销，加强经营管理和加速资金周转等方法，贯彻中央人民政府贸易部大力开展物资交流，活泼城乡经济的决定，并逐步做到土产公司经营管理的企业化。
    在会议进行过程中，到会代表慎重地商讨了各区重要土产的相互交换，并在会议中成立了各区、各省、各市间土产交换的协议五十四份。通过这些协议进行国内交流的土产达一百六十多种，总数一亿八千多万斤（以箱、条、捆等非斤单位计数的土产未计在内），此数相当于一九五○年中国土产公司全年经营商品总额的百分之五十左右。
    【本报讯】在中国土产公司第三次经理会议上，东北、华北、中南、华东、西南、西北六大地区与内蒙古自治区，在区与区，省与省，省与市之间互相订立了土产交换协议。
    在土产交换的协议中，规定各区之间流进流出的数量与种类是非常庞大和繁多的。华东区的土产流进西南区的有海参、海米、海蟹、药材等七种计十六万四千斤；流入中南区的计有明矾、火腿等十九种达七十七万五千斤；流入华北、西北两区的有明矾、海参、竹器等二十九种计二百五十二万六千斤；流入东北区的有红糖、竹器等二十五种计六百万斤。西南区土产流入华东、中南、西南、华北四个地区的有榨菜、桐油、蓓子、药材、土烟叶等五十四种计一千七百六十余万斤。华北区土产流入中南、东北、西北三区的有药材、粉丝、栗子、花椒、红枣、乌枣等五十种达一千一百一十万斤。东北区流入中南、华东、华北等区的有猪油、豆油、水果、药材、牛、驴等二十余种达四百三十八万余斤。西北区流入中南、华北、华东、西南的有木耳、生漆、杏干、葡萄干四十种计三百一十余万斤。内蒙古土产流入华东、中南、华北的有杏仁、瓜子、天然碱、奶油、苦杏等十余种达一百一十万斤。
    这次空前规模的土产大交流，不仅使土产交流逐步地走向计划性，更重要的是，使各个地区滞销的，甚至是弃置于地的土产重新获得了市场，为千百万的农民解决了土产的销路问题，使需要者获得了土产的应供，以及进一步团结私商，共同作好发展国内市场的工作。如偏僻的贵州所产的茅台酒、朱砂、片砂、银耳、雄黄等土产原来销路困难的，这次都有了销路。东北松江的黄烟、线麻过去苦无销路，而关内则迫切需要，这次即解决了两方面的问题。
    这次全国性的物资大交流，是开拓国内贸易的胜利的开端，但今后的困难仍是很多的。各级人民政府和党委，如能切实领导和协助各地土产公司，履行协议合约，保守信用，必可促进全国物资交流工作的顺利展开，为工农业的恢复与发展创造有利的条件。
