　　Experiences of Leading the Masses to Overcome Natural Disasters in East China
    He Kang, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, East China District

    Leading the masses in production must start from the masses' most urgent demands; otherwise, it is easy to become a mere formality. If this is done well, other work will naturally be driven forward. The production and disaster relief efforts in East China last year were successful because they focused on the water management work that the masses most urgently demanded. On the basis of water management, the pest control movement was quickly launched. As the water management and pest control movements gained victory, fertilizer accumulation and seed selection also followed.
    According to experience, the determination of work goals must be adapted to local conditions and cannot be generalized. For example, when Zhejiang Province first launched the production movement last spring, it only vaguely proposed to improve production in all aspects, and the response from the masses was very lukewarm. However, in the pilot project in Hang County, the work quickly started after the goal of a mass water management movement was first determined. Conversely, some places failed to adapt to local conditions and mechanically pursued tasks. For example, some rice-growing areas with abundant experience in preventing rice borers tried to apply it to cotton-growing areas, but it did not work because what the cotton-growing masses needed was experience in preventing cotton pests.
    After the work goals are determined, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education to dispel the masses' concerns. For example, to launch the rice borer control movement, the first thing is to break superstitions, because some of the masses still believe that rice borers are "divine insects." Second, because rice borer control must mobilize the masses to carry out large-scale capture to achieve results. Our experience in rice borer control last year was:
    1. We must use practical examples commonly seen in the lives of the masses to explain the truth and break the masses' superstitious psychology. For example, farmers in Zhejiang Province have a habit of raising silkworms, so we can use the comparison between rice borers and silkworms to break superstitions. At the same time, in the process, we must mobilize conscious and advanced farmers to educate the general backward farmers.
    2. The development of the production movement must have strong leadership: For example, at the beginning of water management and pest control last year, many cadres lacked confidence. Some technical cadres even believed that the Kuomintang had not done a good job for many years, so how could it be done well soon after liberation? At this time, it is necessary to rely on the high attention of the leadership. After water management, the tasks in various aspects were extremely heavy at that time, but the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government resolutely issued instructions and urgently called for mobilization. Subsequently, the local leaders personally took the lead in promoting the work, which greatly improved the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses and cadres, and the movement was successfully launched.
    As for the leadership method, the following points should also be noted:
    First, concentrate efforts at the beginning, grasp the key points, and then fully expand after gaining experience. In rice borer control, the Jiaxing Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Party Committee both paid attention to grasping the key counties, creating experience, promoting the general, and especially strengthening the promotion of backward areas, so that the work could be carried out smoothly.
    Second, it is necessary to promptly grasp the work of evaluating merits, selecting models, and rewarding activists. In the rice borer control in Zhejiang, activists who have achieved results in pest control are selected as pest control pioneers or models and given honorary and material rewards. In Hang County, a pilot county, 4,000 pest control pioneers were produced in the rice borer control last year, which had a great encouragement effect on the masses.
    Third, we must make full use of telecommunications, newspapers, bulletins, etc. as tools to promote work. During the water management and pest control period, the newspapers in Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu focused on water management and pest control, promptly introduced experience, and put forward criticisms and commendations, which were very effective.
    Fourth, it is necessary to improve the leading core, especially the grass-roots production organizations, and establish water management committees from top to bottom, fully absorbing the participation of mass activists and labor models.
    In addition, when launching the pest control movement in the new district, social forces were also widely used, which also played a great role in the current situation of lack of cadres. For example, in the climax of rice borer control in Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu, the administrative authorities ordered primary and secondary schools in areas with severe rice borer damage to take a three-to-ten-day vacation, and teachers and students brought charts and specimens to the countryside to help publicize and organize, and took the lead in pest control. This not only solved the problem of insufficient cadres, but also gave students the opportunity to practice. Both sides benefit. Another example is that Jiaxing mobilized merchants to participate in rice borer control through the Chamber of Commerce by explaining the consistency of agricultural and commercial interests with practical examples, which is of greater significance.
    Fifth, we must grasp the universality and continuity of the production movement, such as water management mainly focusing on winter repairs and spring repairs, but also preventing floods and droughts in summer; rice borer control must grasp three links: collecting eggs and catching moths in spring rice fields, attracting moths with lights in summer, and digging up and destroying rice roots in winter. If you take a break in the middle, taking a breath will affect the effect of the entire work. Therefore, any slack and麻痹 ideas must be criticized and corrected at any time.

　　华东区领导群众克服自然灾害的经验
    华东区农林部副部长  何康
    领导群众生产，必须从群众最迫切的要求出发，否则就易流于形式，只要这一项搞的好，其他工作便自然而然地都带动起来了。华东区去年的生产救灾就是由于抓住了群众最迫切要求的治水工作，而在治水的基础上，很快的又展开了治虫运动，于是随着治水治虫运动的胜利开展，积肥、选种也都跟着开展了。
    根据经验，工作目标的确定，一定要因地制宜，不能一般化。如浙江去年春天开展生产运动之初，只泛泛地提出要在各方面搞好生产，当时群众的反映很冷淡，但在杭县基点首先确定了以群众的治水运动为目标，工作就很快的开展起来。相反，有些地方未能因地制宜，只机械地追求任务，如个别水稻区对防治螟虫的经验很多，但给硬搬到棉区去，事情就办不通了，因为棉区群众所需要是防治棉虫的经验。
    工作目标确定之后，必须深入宣传教育、以解除群众的顾虑。如开展治螟运动，第一要破除迷信，因为还有部分群众相信螟虫是“神虫”。第二、因为治螟必须发动群众进行大规模的捕捉，才能收到效果。我们去年治螟的体验是：
    １、必须采用群众在生活中常见的实际例子，用来说明道理，打破群众的迷信心理，如浙江农民素有养蚕习惯，就可用螟虫和蚕相比来破除迷信。同时在进行当中，还要动员觉悟的先进的农民去教育一般落后的。
    ２、开展生产运动必须有坚强领导：如去年治水治虫之初，很多干部都没有信心，个别技术干部甚至认为过去国民党多年来都没有作好，今天解放不久，怎么就能搞的好？这时就要靠领导上的高度重视。在治水之后，当时各方面的任务异常繁重，但浙江省人民政府决然发出指示，紧急号召动员，继之各地首长亲自动手领导推动，大大地提高了群众和干部的情绪和信心，运动就胜利地展开了。
    至于领导的方法，也要注意以下几项：
    第一、开始时集中力量，掌握重点，取得经验之后再全面展开。嘉兴专署在治螟中，首先专员、地委都注意掌握了重点县，创造经验，推动一般，并且特别加强了对落后地区的推动，使工作得以顺利开展。
    第二、要及时掌握评功劳、选模范、奖励积极分子的工作。浙江治螟中，对治虫有成绩的积极分子，选出治虫先锋或模范，予以名誉与物质奖励。杭县基点县，去年治螟中产生了四千个治虫先锋，对群众的鼓励作用极大。
    第三、要充分利用电讯、报纸、通报等作为推动工作的工具。浙江和苏南报纸在治水治虫期间，以治水治虫为中心内容，及时介绍经验，提出批评与表扬，收效很大。
    第四、要健全领导核心，特别是基层生产组织，要由上而下的建立治水委员会，充分吸收群众积极分子劳动模范等参加。
    此外在新区开展治虫运动时，还广泛地运用了社会力量，这在目前干部缺乏的情况下，作用也是很大的。如浙江苏南在治螟高潮中，行政上即令螟害严重区域的中小学校放假三到十天，师生一起带了图表标本深入农村，帮助宣传组织，带头治虫。这不但解决了干部不足的问题，同时也使学生获得了实习的机会。双方都有好处。又如嘉兴通过商会以实际例子说明农商利害的一致，发动了商人也参加治螟，意义更大。
    第五、必须掌握生产运动的普遍性与连续性，如治水以冬修春修为主，但夏季要防汛同时防旱；治螟要掌握三个环节：春季秧田要采卵捕蛾，夏季要点灯诱蛾，冬季要掘毁稻根，如果中途歇一歇，松口气就会影响到整个工作的效果，因此，任何松懈麻痹的思想，必须随时批判纠正。
