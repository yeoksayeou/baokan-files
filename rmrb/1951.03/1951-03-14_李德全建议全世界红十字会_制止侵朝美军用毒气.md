　　Li Dequan Suggests That Red Cross Societies Worldwide
    Stop the US Military's Use of Poison Gas in the Korean War
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 13th] Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, issued a written statement today, suggesting that Red Cross societies worldwide launch a righteous appeal and practical sanctions to stop the US invading army's crime of using poison gas in the Korean War. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    The use of poison gas in war is an inhumane and cruel act, which has always been despised by civilized people. Therefore, countries around the world have established conventions on the prohibition of the use of poison gas at the Hague Conference in 1899 and the Geneva Conference in 1925. Recently, after repeated failures in the Korean War, the US invading army has disregarded world opinion and openly violated international law by using poison gas bombs on the Korean front. This inhuman crime of the US invading army will surely be met with angry protests and opposition from people all over the world who advocate humanitarianism and justice.
    The Red Cross has always regarded safeguarding peace and humanitarianism as its own responsibility and must not tolerate the continued occurrence of such inhumane crimes. In addition to expressing serious protest to the US authorities on behalf of the Red Cross Society of China, I also suggest that the Red Cross societies of 68 countries around the world call on 100 million Red Cross members to launch a righteous appeal and practical sanctions to stop the US imperialism's atrocity of using poison gas in the Korean War.
    Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, March 13th

　　李德全建议全世界红十字会
    制止侵朝美军用毒气
    【新华社十三日讯】中国红十字会总会会长李德全今日发表书面谈话，建议全世界红十字会发起正义的呼声和实际制裁行动，制止美国侵略军在侵略朝鲜战争中使用毒气的罪行。谈话全文如下：
    在战争中使用毒气是违反人道的残酷行为，从来为文明人类所不齿。因此，世界各国在一八九九年的海牙会议和一九二五年的日内瓦会议中，均曾订立关于禁止使用毒气的公约。最近美国侵略军于侵略朝鲜战争屡次失败之后，竟冒天下之大不韪，公然破坏国际公法，在朝鲜前线使用毒气炸弹。美国侵略军这一丧失人性的罪行，必将受到全世界主张人道与正义人士的愤怒抗议和反对。
    红十字会素以维护和平和人道主义精神为本身职责，绝不能容忍这类灭绝人性的罪行继续发生。我除代表中国红十字会向美国当局表示严重抗议外，并建议全世界六十八个国家的红十字会，号召一亿红十字会员，发起正义之呼声和实际制裁行动，制止美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜战争中使用毒气的暴行。
    中国红十字会总会会长李德全  三月十三日
