Below we publish an investigation record of the Chahar South Rural Anti-American, Aid-Korea Propaganda Work by the CCP Chahar South Local Committee. From this record, it can be seen that in some rural areas of Chahar South, until January of this year, there was almost no anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda work carried out. Some had conducted it at one point, but it was not very thorough. Therefore, the peasant masses still lacked basic understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea. The record points out that the reason for this phenomenon is that the leading organs are satisfied with the existing achievements of the anti-American, aid-Korea movement in the cities and some rural areas. This is something to be vigilant about. Although this investigation was conducted in January, the local situation may have changed somewhat, it can emphatically illustrate that it is necessary to vigorously carry out the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda and education movement in rural areas. It is wrong to only carry out such propaganda in cities and neglect rural areas. The following is the investigation record of the CCP Chahar South Local Committee:

In order to understand the propaganda situation of resisting America and aiding Korea below, we specifically spent three days from January 8th to 10th checking sixteen villages (four in the Sixth District of Xuanhua, eight in the Seventh District, and four in the Eighth District). These sixteen villages are all located on both sides of the railway, around the east, south, and west of Xuanhua City, including nine villages that have undergone party rectification. The recorded situation of the investigation is as follows:

(1) From the perspective of district cadres' propaganda to the masses: In Shenjiatun and Jiangjiatun villages in the Sixth District, district cadres did not hold a mass meeting once in more than two months, and party members only held one meeting after returning from training. In Ertai, Da, and Xiao Manling villages in the Seventh District, district cadres went twice since the autumn harvest, once to urge grain and once to mobilize trainees, but they did not talk about resisting America and aiding Korea, and the district cadres who went down were the district committee propaganda member and the women's federation director. The seven party members in Ertai held only a branch meeting after returning to the village from training, conveying the above opinions on production. The party rectification in the eight villages in the Eighth District has ended. Because no propaganda members, reading groups, or other institutions have been established, the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda ended after the work team left, and there was no more propaganda.

(2) From the perspective of various forms of propaganda: There are eight blackboards in the sixteen villages. Except for Da Manling and Yujiatun, which can insist on regular replacement, the other six blackboards are either there are boards but no newspapers, or they have not been replaced for a long time. The blackboard in Ertai was copied by a primary school teacher from a section of the newspaper before the Chinese New Year on the 20th, which was neither relevant to the rural situation nor very good in terms of wording: "...For the hegemonic desires of a handful of tycoons on Wall Street (享 was mistakenly copied as 享 in the poem), they violate the charter and undermine peace. What Marshall? What Truman? Bah, another batch of Tojo and Hitler reincarnations. What about atomic bombs and super hydrogen (?), to this day they can't scare the people who have stood up! My lips and teeth are interdependent with Korea, and we share our fate. The hard struggle of the Korean people cannot be separated from us. Look at the crazy invasion of Korea and the violation of our airspace..." This is something no one in the village can understand. Fifteen of the sixteen villages have established winter schools, eight of which can persist. However, the students enrolled are not widespread enough. None of the eight winter schools in the Eighth District have women, and only two of the four in the Sixth District have a few women. The winter schools in Shangbali and Shageta villages in the Eighth District collapsed again after the work team left. In terms of current affairs education, only the teacher of the Xiao Manling winter school read the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda material once, mostly focusing on literacy, with very little talk about current affairs. There are no reading groups in the sixteen villages, and the loudspeakers are used to gather for meetings. Not a single village among the sixteen has new slogans for resisting America and aiding Korea. The propaganda by teachers and students was only carried out once by Shangbali in Da Manling during the New Year's entertainment competition.

(3) From the perspective of the peasants' understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea: Although some condolence bags were made in Ertai, Xiaojiafang, and other villages, some people did not know why they were made. When asked the village chief and three cadres of civil affairs in Ertai village "Why resist America and aid Korea?", they could not answer and asked to ask the branch secretary. When asked three elderly people in Xiao Manling, they said: "We are old and only do some work, we don't worry about anything; no one tells us, and we don't inquire." A young winter school teacher interrupted and said: "The old men don't understand, the young people in winter school know." So we asked some young people, and they were not very clear either. From this, it can be seen that the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea still needs to be greatly strengthened.

Future suggestions:

The significant achievements of the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda in many cities and some rural areas of Chahar South are certain, but in leadership, there is still a serious phenomenon of satisfaction with the status quo, which must be overcome.

It is necessary to conscientiously and universally carry out anti-American patriotic education in the small villages in the mountains, truly achieving household awareness, known to women and children. To this end, it is necessary to adopt various methods and persist tenaciously for a long time. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to popularize and deepen the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda and education work, and to rectify the winter schools, reading groups, blackboards, and broadcasting stations to make them play a greater role.

Developing propagandists in various movements and organizing propaganda networks is a method to put propaganda work on track, which must be given attention and earnestly done everywhere.

Strengthen cadres' current affairs learning, so that everyone attaches importance to current affairs propaganda, and develop the habit and ability to combine current affairs propaganda with all work, conducting propaganda anytime and anywhere, and talking about current affairs at every meeting. Leadership attaching importance to and personally participating in current affairs propaganda is an important key to doing this work well.

### 察南农村抗美援朝宣传工作应该加强

　　察南农村抗美援朝宣传工作应该加强
    下面我们发表了中国共产党察南地方委员会关于察南农村抗美援朝宣传工作的一个调查纪录。从这个纪录可以看出，察南有些农村，直到今年一月间，还几乎没有进行抗美援朝的宣传工作。有些一度进行过，但是很不深入。因此，农民群众对抗美援朝还缺乏起码的认识。这个纪录指出，发生这种现象的原因，是领导机关满足于抗美援朝运动在城市和有些农村中已有的成绩。这是值得警惕的。虽然这个调查是在一月间作的，当地情况有些可能已经有了变化，但它可以着重地说明，必须在农村中大力开展抗美援朝的宣传教育运动，只在城市中进行这种宣传，而忽视了农村，是不对的。下面就是中共察南地委的调查纪录：
    我们为了了解下边抗美援朝宣传情况，特于一月八日至十日三天时间分别到宣化六、七、八区，对十六个村（七区四个、八区八个、六区四个）作了检查。这十六个村庄均在铁路两旁，宣化市的东、南、西周围，其中有整过党的九个村。考查的情况纪录如下：
    （一）从区干部对群众宣传方面看：六区申家屯、江家屯等三村，在二个多月中，区干部没去召开过一次群众大会，党员受训回去只开了一次会。七区二台、大、小慢岭三村从秋耕以来，区干部去过两次，一次催粮，一次动员受训学员，但都未谈过抗美援朝的事，而且下去的区干部还是区委宣传委员和妇联主任呢。二台七个党员受训回村只开了个支部会，传达了上面对生产的意见。八区八个村整党已结束，因为没有建立宣传员、读报组等机构，工作组走后，抗美援朝宣传也就此结束，再也没宣传过。
    （二）从各种宣传形式上看：十六个村有黑板报八块，除大慢岭、于家屯能坚持经常更换外，其他六块都是有板无报，或长期不换。二台一块黑板报，在年前二十号由小学教员抄写报纸上一段既不切合农村情况，在文字上也很坏的诗：“……为了华尔街一撮大亨（诗内抄成享字）的霸世欲，违背宪章，破坏和平。什么马歇尔？什么杜鲁门？呸，又一批东条、希特勒等化身。说什么原子弹又超级氢（？），到今朝已吓不倒站起来的人民！我与朝鲜唇亡齿寒，相依为命，朝鲜人人艰苦斗争与我们不能划分，看疯狂侵朝犯我领空。………”这是村子里没人能看懂的。十六个村已有十五村办了冬学，其中八个能坚持。但入校学生不够广泛，八区八个冬学中没一个妇女，六区四个只有两个村有少数妇女。八区上八里、沙圪塔等三村的冬学，工作组走后，又垮台了。在时事教育方面，只是小慢岭冬学教员照着抗美援朝宣传材料念了一次，大部认字为主，很少讲时事。十六个村全无读报组，广播筒是用来召集开会的。十六个村没有一个村有抗美援朝的新标语。教员、学生的宣传只大慢岭上八里在新年文娱比赛时进行了一次时事宣传。
    （三）从农民群众对抗美援朝的了解程度看：二台、肖家房等村虽做了若干慰问袋，但有的人不知为什么做。问二台村长和民政等三个干部“为什么要抗美援朝”，他们答不来，叫问支部书记去。在小慢岭问了三个老年人，他们说：“年岁大了，除了干些活，啥心也不操；没人给说，咱也不打听。”在场有个年青的冬学教员插嘴就说：“老汉们不懂，上冬学的年青人们知道。”我们就问了一些年青人，他们也弄不很清楚。由此可见，抗美援朝的宣传还需要很大的加强。
    今后意见：
    在察南的许多城市和一部分农村中，抗美援朝宣传的显著成绩是肯定的，但是在领导上，还严重地存在着满足现状的现象，这种现象必须克服。
    必须把反美爱国教育认真地普遍深入到山沟小庄，真正做到家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。为此，就必须采用各种办法长期地顽强地坚持下去。因此，须要继续普及深入抗美援朝宣传教育工作，并把冬学、读报组、黑板报、广播台加以整顿，使其发挥更大的作用。
    在各种运动中发展宣传员，组织宣传网，乃是使宣传工作走上轨道的方法，必须引起各地重视，认真地去做。
    加强干部的时事学习，使大家都重视时事宣传工作，并养成善于与一切工作结合进行时事宣传的习惯和能力，随时随地进行宣传，逢开会就讲时事。领导上重视并亲自参加时事宣传工作，这是把这一工作做好的一个重要关键。
