　　Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Support the Labor Insurance Regulations
    [Report from this newspaper] The preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement supporting the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government. The original text is as follows:
    Our State Council of the Central People's Government has promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations and stipulated that they will be implemented starting from March 1st. This provides appropriate care and solutions for the difficulties faced by the broad masses of workers and staff in terms of birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability. It is conceivable that it will have a significant effect and an excellent impact on the restoration and development of production. The administrative departments or capitalists of various enterprises implementing labor insurance will also inevitably benefit from the restoration and development of production. This is a measure of great significance for our country. In addition to cherishing it very much, we should also recognize that this regulation was achieved after thirty years of arduous struggle by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, engaged in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and finally achieving a nationwide victory.
    The implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations is a great joyous event for the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country. The industrial and commercial circles in our capital warmly support this regulation and congratulate the workers and staff who are the first to enjoy the rights of labor insurance. We are willing to do our best, under the supervision of the government, wholeheartedly and earnestly implement the provisions of the Labor Insurance Regulations.

　　北京市工商界拥护劳动保险条例
    【本报讯】北京市工商联合会筹委会发表声明，拥护中央人民政府政务院颁布的劳动保险条例，原文如下：
    我中央人民政府政务院公布了劳动保险条例，并定自三月一日开始实行。这使广大职工的生、老、病、死、伤、残等困难问题，获得了适当的照顾与解决。可以想到，在恢复和发展生产方面，一定会发生显著的效果，发生极好的影响。在实行劳动保险的各企业行政方面或资方，亦必将因此获得生产恢复与发展的利益。这是我们国家一件有重大意义的措施。我们除了应该十分珍视它以外，更应认识到：这个条例是三十年来全国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导下，历尽艰辛，从事反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的斗争获得了全国范围的胜利才得以实现的。
    劳动保险条例的实施，是中国工人阶级和全国人民的一件大喜事。我们首都工商界热烈拥护这项条例，并向这次首先获得享受劳动保险权利的职工们祝贺。我们愿竭尽全力在政府监督之下，全心全意，切实地执行劳动保险条例的规定。
