To the Editor:
    In order to commend construction worker Li Yuliang's positive performance in exposing unlawful elements and loving national construction, our team, after discussing with the Seventh District Federation of Trade Unions in this city, decided to extract 3 million yuan from the 20 million yuan compensation fee from Jianxing Construction Factory and issue it to worker Li Yuliang as a bonus. Comrade Wang Anjiu, deputy section chief of our team, has been criticized and ordered to conduct a thorough self-criticism and correct his mistakes for his paralyzed behavior of not paying attention to Comrade Li Yuliang's correct suggestions.
