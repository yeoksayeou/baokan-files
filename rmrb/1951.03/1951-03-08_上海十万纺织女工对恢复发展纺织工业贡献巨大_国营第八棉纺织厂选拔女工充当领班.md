Shanghai's 100,000 Female Textile Workers Make Great Contributions to the Restoration and Development of the Textile Industry
State-Owned No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory Selects Female Workers to Serve as Foremen

Shanghai's more than 100,000 female textile workers have played a huge role in the restoration and development of the textile industry. The Shanghai cotton textile industry, where female workers account for 70% of the total number of employees, exceeded its annual target in November 1950, with cotton yarn production exceeding the plan by 16.14% and cotton cloth by 7.62%. Production efficiency in both public and private cotton textile factories has generally improved. The average output of 20-count yarn in 20 hours in state-owned factories reached more than one pound; the state-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory set a national record for cotton yarn production with 1.2788 pounds.

Due to diligent production, many female workers have been selected as labor models. Among the 673 labor models selected in the city last September, there were 54 female textile workers. Hang Peilan, a national labor model representative from the state-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, won the red flag four times while working in the first row of the factory and recently led the relatively backward third row to become a model row that has also won the red flag four times. Ren Gendi, a labor model in the cloth weaving section of the state-owned No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, produced only three pieces of substandard cloth last year, with a substandard rate of less than 0.16% (the standard is 3%); her output in ten hours reached 45 yards, also exceeding the prescribed standard. Under her leadership, the substandard rate in the No. 3 factory's cloth weaving section is less than 2%, and both output and quality are the best among state-owned cloth factories in the city.

Many outstanding female textile workers have been promoted to technicians, assistant engineers, or elected as members of the factory management committee. Zhao Meizhen, vice chairman of the trade union of the state-owned No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, and Xia Binglian, a labor model of the No. 19 factory, were promoted to assistant fine spinning engineers. The state-owned No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory has even systematically promoted seven female workers to serve as foremen.

Currently, more than a dozen female worker advanced groups in the city have challenged the Ma Hengchang group, preparing to create female worker production groups in the style of the Ma Hengchang group.

The State-Owned No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory in Shanghai promoted seven female workers to be workshop foremen, which had a good effect on improving production management.

When the factory's administrative leaders raised the issue of preparing to promote female foremen among the cadres, they found that many cadres had ideas of belittling and distrusting female workers, especially the senior administrative staff had the most doubts and concerns. They believed that female workers could not be cadres, and that in the history of the textile industry, female workers had never been promoted to foremen; what if they were useless or irresponsible after being promoted? Some people thought: "Even if we want to promote, we have to do it step by step. Promoting a car worker to foreman at once, this three-level promotion is too fast." In response to these ideological situations, the administrative leadership department convened a Communist Party branch meeting and a meeting of party, government, trade union, and youth league cadres to mobilize, explain the criteria for promoting cadres and the benefits of promoting cadres from the working masses, and criticize the thinking of some employees who considered themselves veterans. After a long period of deliberation, the administrative leadership department announced in September last year the promotion of Sun Xiuzhen, Chen Lingdi, Wu Xiuying, Sheng Xiuying, Tang Liandi, Wang Gendi, and Jin Lingzhen, seven female workers, to be workshop foremen. They were all skilled workers with 11 to 20 years of experience, rich production experience, and the best relationships with the masses, four of whom were responsible trade union cadres.

Facts over the past three months have proved that female foremen are competent for their jobs; in some areas, such as caring for female workers, they are much better than male foremen. After becoming foremen, they still did not leave the workshop for a moment, just like in the past. In addition to doing their own work, they also took the initiative to help the female workers, which made everyone feel very kind and changed everyone's previous views on administrative management personnel. The female foreman in the cloth weaving section tried to adjust the four pregnant female car workers to be daily wage workers to reduce their workload. The female foreman in the fine spinning section allowed the nursing mothers to take the hanging ladder downstairs to the nursery to save them time and take care of their bodies. These thoughtful and moving examples encouraged the production enthusiasm of all female workers, and everyone said: "Big Sister is so good!" Relying on their decades of production experience, the female foremen united the workers to jointly improve production. The female foreman in the cloth room carefully re-inspected each piece of substandard cloth, identified the problem, tried to repair it into first-class cloth, and informed the workshop where the problem occurred to pay attention, so as to reduce the substandard rate.

Now, the factory's administrative leadership department has planned to use the following methods to further help them improve their work: (1) Task the technicians, engineers, secretaries, and other personnel in each workshop to help them systematically learn the technical theory and applied writing of the department's work so that they can gradually work independently. (2) Run amateur technical study classes, with engineers and technicians responsible for teaching, so that they can systematically study textile industrial technology to shoulder more work and play a greater role. (3) The Party, the Youth League, and the trade union must strengthen their education and leadership, and often care about their work and life and help solve various difficulties.

　　上海十万纺织女工对恢复发展纺织工业贡献巨大
    国营第八棉纺织厂选拔女工充当领班
    上海十余万纺织女工，在恢复与发展纺织工业中起了巨大作用。女工占职工总数百分之七十的上海棉纺织工业，一九五零年十一个月即超额完成了全年任务，计棉纱产量超过计划百分之十六点一四，棉布超过百分之七点六二。公、私营棉纺织厂生产效率普遍提高。国营各厂二十支纱二十小时平均产量达到一磅以上；国营棉纺织第二厂并以一点二七八八磅创全国棉纱产量的最高纪录。
    由于生产的努力，很多女工被选为劳动模范。去年九月全市评选出的六百七十三位劳动模范中，即有纺织女工五十四人。全国劳动模范代表国营棉纺织第一厂女工杭佩兰，在该厂第一排工作时曾连得四次红旗，近来又把比较落后的第三排也领导成为四次获得红旗的模范排。国营棉纺织第三厂布机间劳动模范任根娣，去年所织的布只有三匹是次布，次布率不及千分之一点六（标准是百分之三）；她在十小时中的产量达四十五码，也超过规定标准。在她的带头下，三厂布机间次布率不及百分之二，产量、质量都是全市国营布厂第一。
    不少优秀纺织女工已被提升为技术员、助理员或当选为工厂管理委员会的委员。国营棉纺织第六厂工会副主席赵美珍和十九厂劳动模范夏炳莲被提升为精纺助理员。国营棉纺织第八厂更有计划地提升了七位女工当领班。
    目前全市已有十多个女工先进小组向马恒昌小组应战，准备创建马恒昌小组式的女工生产小组。

    上海国营第八棉纺织厂提拔了七名女工当车间领班，对改进生产管理有很好效果。
    当该厂行政领导人把准备提拔女领班的问题在干部中提出时，发现不少干部对女工有轻视和不信任的思想，尤以高级行政人员的怀疑和顾虑最多。他们认为：女工当干部不行，纺织业历史上从来没有提拔女工当领班的；提拔起来不中用或不负责可怎么办？有的认为：“要提升也得一级一级来，一下把当车工提为领班，这样连升三级，未免太快了。”行政领导部门针对着这些思想情况，召开了共产党支部大会及党、政、工、团干部会议，进行动员，解释了提拔干部的标准和从工人群众中提拔干部的好处，并批判了部分职工中以老资格自居的思想。经过长期的酝酿，行政领导部门于去年九月宣布提拔孙秀珍、陈玲弟、吴秀英、盛秀英、唐连弟、王根弟、金玲珍七个女工为车间领班。她们都是工龄在十一年到二十年以上，生产经验丰富，群众关系最好的熟练工人，其中有四位并是工会负责干部。
    三个多月来的事实证明，女领班们是能胜任工作的；有些地方如关心女工等，更比男领班要强得多。她们当了领班后，仍然和过去一样，一刻也不离开车间，除了做自己本份的工作外，还主动帮助女工们干活，使大家感到很亲切，改变了大家以前对行政管理人员的看法。布机间女领班把四个怀孕的当车女工设法调成日计工，减轻她们的工作。细纱间女领班让喂奶的妈妈们坐吊梯下楼到托儿所，以节省她们的时间和照顾她们的身体。这些体贴入微的动人事例，鼓励了全体女工的生产情绪，大家都说：“大阿姐真好！”女领班们依靠了十几年的生产经验，团结职工群众共同改进生产。布房间女领班更细心地复验着每一匹次布，看出毛病，尽量修理成头等布，并告诉出毛病的车间注意，使次布率降低。
    现该厂行政领导部门已计划用下列办法，更进一步帮助她们提高工作：（一）责成各车间的技师、技术员、书记工等，帮助她们有计划地学习本部门工作的技术理论及应用文字，使她们慢慢地能完全独立工作。（二）开办业余技术学习班，由工程师、技术员负责教课，使她们系统地学习纺织工业技术，以负担更多的工作，起更大的作用。（三）党、团、工会要加强对她们的教育领导，经常关心她们的工作与生活，帮助解决各种困难。
