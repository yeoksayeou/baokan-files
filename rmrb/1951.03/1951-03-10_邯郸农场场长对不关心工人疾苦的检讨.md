Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 24 published an article titled "Hebei Provincial Handan Farm Should Pay Attention to the Cold Protection Equipment of Workers' Dormitories," which criticized the farm for not caring about the hardships of the workers. We believe this criticism is correct, and it will greatly help the farm improve its work in the future. We do have some problems in relying on the working class to do a good job in farm production, and now we make the following self-criticism:
    The workers' request for stoves in the dormitories and the cotton ginning workers' request for masks are related to the entire production and are correct. At that time, we only mechanically emphasized the financial system and emphasized that the Provincial Department of Agriculture was not allowed to reimburse; we did not actively try to solve the difficulties for the workers, and we did not explain it well to the workers. As a result, it was delayed, and the problem of cold protection was not resolved until the beginning of January. This shows that we do not care about the hardships of the workers and that our view of relying on the working class is not clear.
    However, after the workers raised the above legitimate demands, we reported to the Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture several times, but received no reply. Especially regarding the issue of heating in workers' dormitories, we personally went to Baoding to discuss with Comrade Zhang Wenzhu, an accountant of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, twice, but were not approved. This year, when we went to the Provincial Department of Agriculture for reimbursement, the Department of Agriculture still refused to reimburse this expense, and the problem has not been resolved until now.
                                  Shen Tingxiang, Director of Hebei Provincial Handan Farm

### 邯郸农场场长对不关心工人疾苦的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　邯郸农场场长对不关心工人疾苦的检讨编辑同志：
    一月二十四日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登“河北省立邯郸农场应注意工人宿舍的防寒设备”一稿，对本场不关心工人疾苦提出了批评。我们认为这一批评很对，这对本场今后改进工作有很大帮助。我们在依靠工人阶级搞好农场生产方面，确实存在着一些问题，现在检讨如下：
    工人要求宿舍生火炉，轧花工人要求发口罩，这些要求是对整个生产有关的，是正确的。当时我们只机械地强调了财政制度，强调了省府农业厅不准报销；没有积极地想法替工人解决困难，更没有向工人很好地解释。以致拖延时日，到一月初防寒问题才解决。这可以说明我们对工人的疾苦不关心，依靠工人阶级的观点不明确。
    但工人提出以上正当要求后，我们曾数次报告河北省人民政府农业厅，均未获答复。特别是关于工人宿舍生火问题，我们曾亲赴保定与省政府农业厅会计张文竹同志面商两次，均未蒙批准。今年我们到省政府农业厅报销时，农业厅还是不让报销此项开支，一直到现在问题仍不得解决。
