　　Domestic Literary and Art Developments

　　Since the re-publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice," it has aroused attention and research in literary and art circles. The editorial "Continuously Pave the Way for Recognizing Truth in Practice," published in the third volume, ninth issue of "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), discusses the great significance of studying "On Practice" for further promoting literary and artistic creation and literary and art criticism. The fifth issue of the third volume of "Renmin Wenxue" (People's Literature) published He Qifang's essay "’On Practice’ and Literary Creation," which provides a detailed discussion on the relationship between practice and literary creation, as well as the ideological and artistic aspects of literary works. The publication of these two articles marks the beginning of literary and art workers studying "On Practice." The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles will organize the literary and art circles to conduct a more systematic study of Chairman Mao's outstanding work.

　　More than 500 representatives from Shanghai's literary and art circles gathered on the 25th of last month to solemnly commemorate the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Chinese revolutionary literary and art fighters Rou Shi, Hu Yepin, Bai Mang, Li Weisen, and Feng Keng. Newspapers also published special commemorative issues for the five martyrs. The five martyrs were all members of the "Chinese Left-Wing Writers League" (referred to as the "Left League," established in Shanghai in March 1930 and dissolved in 1935, which played a great role in the Chinese cultural movement). They were arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries on January 17, 1931, and secretly shot along with eighteen other revolutionary comrades on February 7 at the Longhua Kuomintang Gendarmerie Headquarters in Shanghai. The blood of the five martyrs records an important page in the history of Chinese revolutionary literature. They are worthy of permanent commemoration.

　　Among the recently published works of worker-peasant literary and art creation, Chen Dengke's "Sister-in-Law Du" (one of the "Literary Creation Series," published by Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch) and Wang Anyou's "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage" (published by Xinhua Bookstore Shandong Branch) are two relatively good novellas. In "Sister-in-Law Du," the author vividly portrays a female hero and leader of a guerrilla team—Sister-in-Law Du—in her tenacious struggle against the Kuomintang bandit army and local tyrants. Wang Anyou's "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage" focuses on the theme of anti-feudal marriage and depicts the process of a young widow oppressed by her mother-in-law remarrying. The author of "Sister-in-Law Du," Chen Dengke, came from a poor peasant background, having farmed, served as a soldier, and worked as an orderly. His other work, "Living Man's Pond," was published in the "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" (Talking and Singing) monthly magazine and received good reviews. The author of "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage," Wang Anyou, came from an illiterate tenant farmer background. He was still farming six or seven years ago. After arduous study, he wrote many newsletters, and this is one of his longer works. Although these two works of worker-peasant creation still have some shortcomings (in terms of content and writing skills), they prove the talent of worker-peasant cadres and activists in literary creation.

　　国内文艺动态
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》重新发表之后，已引起文艺界的重视与研究。三卷九期《文艺报》发表的社论“在实践中不断开辟认识真理的道路”，论述了学习《实践论》，对于进一步推动文艺创作与文艺理论批评的重大意义。三卷五期《人民文学》发表了何其芳的论文“《实践论》与文艺创作”，对实践与文艺创作的关系以及文艺作品的思想性、艺术性各方面都有详细的论述。这两篇文章的发表，是文艺工作者学习《实践论》的开始。全国文联将组织文艺界更有系统地来展开关于毛主席这一杰出著作的学习。
    上海文艺界代表五百余人在上月二十五日集会隆重纪念中国革命文艺战士柔石、胡也频、白莽、李伟森、冯铿殉难二十周年。各报并出版五烈士的纪念特刊。五位烈士都是“中国左翼作家联盟”（简称“左联”，于一九三○年三月在上海成立，一九三五年解散，曾在中国文化运动上起了伟大的作用）的会员，一九三一年一月十七日同时被国民党反动派逮捕，二月七日和另外十八位革命志士一起被秘密枪杀在上海龙华国民党警备司令部里。五位烈士的鲜血，纪录了中国革命文学历史的重要的一页。他们是值得人们永久纪念的。
    最近出版的工农文艺创作中，陈登科作的《杜大嫂》（文艺创作丛书之一，新华书店华东总分店出版）及王安友作的《李二嫂改嫁》（新华书店山东总分店出版），是两个比较好的中篇小说。在《杜大嫂》中，作者生动地描写了一个游击队的女英雄和领导者——杜大嫂——与国民党匪军、地主恶霸所进行的顽强战斗。王安友所作的《李二嫂改嫁》是以反封建婚姻为主题的，描写一个受婆婆欺压的青年寡妇改嫁的经过。《杜大嫂》的作者陈登科是贫农出身，种过田，当过兵，当过勤务员。他的另一作品《活人塘》曾刊载于《说说唱唱》月刊，获得好评。《李二嫂改嫁》的作者王安友是不识字的雇农出身，六七年前还在种地，经过坚苦学习，写了不少通讯，这是他的一篇比较长的作品。他们这两篇工农创作的作品，虽则还存在着一些缺点（在作品内容上，以及在写作技巧上），但它们证明了工农干部和工农中积极分子在文学创作方面的才能。
