Conscientiously Protect the Health of Pregnant Female Workers

The health of pregnant female workers urgently needs to be addressed by all relevant parties. According to materials from the Shanghai State-owned No. 9 and No. 15 Cotton Textile Factories, among the 720 pregnant female workers in those two factories from January to September 1950, 79 experienced miscarriages, premature births, or difficult labors, accounting for 11% of the total number of pregnant workers. Pregnant female workers generally account for about 10% of the female workforce. Therefore, the health of pregnant female workers not only directly affects production, but also concerns the lives and safety of tens of thousands of women and the second generation of the working class.

Before liberation, this problem was even more serious than it is now. In addition to enduring the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class that all workers suffered, female workers faced particular difficulties and pain. Their pregnancies and childbirths were not only ignored but were even used by the reactionary ruling class as excuses to intensify exploitation or even arbitrarily "dismiss" female workers.

Since liberation, the people's government, within the scope permitted by the country's overall financial and economic situation, has begun to gradually solve the difficulties of workers as production recovers and develops. The recently promulgated Labor Insurance Regulations by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government provide special preferential treatment for female workers' retirement and maternity. However, the issue of protecting the health of pregnant female workers has not yet received widespread attention in all factories.

Some factory administrative cadres have believed that current financial difficulties mean that if special attention is paid to the unique pain of pregnant women, and efforts are made to reduce or transfer their work, it would inevitably increase staffing, affect costs, and disrupt labor organization. Some trade union cadres also believe this is a troublesome issue and even fail to face it squarely. This mindset of factory administrative cadres and trade union cadres, which focuses solely on production interests and disregards, does not care about, and does not seek to resolve the suffering of the workers, actually hinders production and endangers the safety of two generations.

Facts have proven that as long as we deeply understand and care about the difficulties of workers, truly rely on the masses of workers, raise their awareness, and organize the labor force well, this problem can be appropriately resolved. The method of Shanghai State-owned No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory, which mobilized workers to establish mutual aid pacts to solve the difficulties of pregnant female workers, is worthy of reference by other regions. Of course, this method cannot completely, thoroughly, and permanently solve the problem of pregnant women. Each factory must also, according to possible conditions, add or adjust a certain proportion of standby workers according to the number of pregnant female workers in the factory, so as to transfer pregnant female workers who are more than eight months pregnant to lighter work or as substitutes for pregnant women who are on maternity leave.

Naturally, the degree of protecting the health of pregnant female workers is adapted to the recovery and development of overall production. Therefore, female workers must play an active role in production, gradually improve working conditions through changes in economic conditions, and seek a thorough solution to their unique difficulties and pain.

### 认真保护怀孕女工的健康

　　认真保护怀孕女工的健康
    怀孕女工的健康问题，急需引起各有关方面的注意。根据上海国营第九、第十五棉纺织厂的材料，该两厂在一九五○年一月到九月所有七百二十名怀孕女工中，流产、早产、难产的有七十九人，达产妇总数的百分之十一。怀孕女工，一般占女工百分之十左右。因此，怀孕女工的健康问题，不仅直接影响生产，而且是数万妇女及工人阶级第二代的生命安全问题。
    这一问题，解放前的情况较之现在更为严重。女工除忍受工人阶级一般所受反动统治阶级的剥削与压迫以外，其特殊困难与痛苦，如怀孕、生育等不仅不能得到照顾，适足成为反动统治阶级加重剥削以至任意“开除”女工的借口。
    解放以后的人民政权，在国家整个财政经济情况许可的范围以内，随着生产的恢复与发展，已经着手逐步解决工人的困难。最近中央人民政府政务院公布了劳动保险条例，对于女工的养老和生育问题，更有特殊的优待。但是，保护怀孕女工的健康问题，至今仍未引起各工厂普遍的重视。
    曾经有这样一部分工厂行政干部，认为目前财政困难，如果要照顾到孕妇的特殊痛苦，设法减轻或调动其工作，则势必要增添员工，影响成本和打乱劳动组织。一部分工会干部也以为这是个麻烦问题，甚至不去正视这一问题。工厂行政干部及工会干部这种单纯重视生产利益而不重视、不关心、不想法解决工人群众痛苦的思想作风，实际上妨碍了生产并危及两代的生命安全。
    事实证明：只要深入了解并关心工人疾苦，切实依靠工人群众，提高他们觉悟，并将劳动力组织得好，这一问题就可以求得适当的解决。上海国营第八棉纺织厂发动工友订立互助公约以解决怀孕女工困难的办法，即值得各地参考。自然，这一办法还不可能全部、彻底、长期地解决孕妇问题。各厂还须根据可能情况，按照本厂怀孕女工人数增添或调整一定比例的准备工，以便调动八个月以上怀孕女工做轻便工作或作为孕妇请产假时的替工。
    自然，保护怀孕女工健康的程度，是和整个生产的恢复与发展相适应的。因此，女工们要在生产中起积极作用，从经济条件的改变中来逐步改善劳动条件，求得自身特殊困难与痛苦的彻底解决。
