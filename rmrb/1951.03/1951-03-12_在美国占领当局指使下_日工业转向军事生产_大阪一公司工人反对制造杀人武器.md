Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: According to a report from the United Press, the Tokai region (the southeastern coastal area of central Honshu), which was the center of aircraft manufacturing in Japan during the war, is now rapidly shifting to military production, with textiles, chemicals, and other industries taking the lead. Under the direction of the US occupation authorities, fourteen monopoly enterprises, including "Mitsui Chemical," "Toyo Rayon," "Nippon Gosei," "Kureha Spinning," "Kurashiki Spinning," and "Dai Nippon Spinning," have all been absorbed into former military-supply factories in Aichi Prefecture. The investment in these factories amounts to 20 billion yen. Taking the fiber industry in Aichi Prefecture as an example, before the war there were only 150 factories with 6,000 looms; but by November of last year, the number of factories had greatly increased, and the number of looms had increased to 9,900, making it the largest supplier of military uniforms in Japan. In the chemical industry, the Nagoya factory of Mitsui Chemical Company, "Nippon Gosei," "Toyo Rayon" and other companies are also producing military supplies. In addition, in the metal industry, the Yoshiwara factory of "Nissan" Motor Company is manufacturing military vehicles for the "Police Reserve Force," and Toyota Motor Company will manufacture 4,500 jeeps for the "Police Reserve Force" in the fiscal years 1950 and 1951. Fuji Sangyo Company's Toyota factory is manufacturing armored vehicles, and the company's Yokkaichi factory is manufacturing artillery shells. Kobe Steel Works is manufacturing searchlights for the "Maritime Safety Agency." Kayaba Industry Company is producing artillery parts. and Mie Enamel Company is manufacturing steel helmets.

According to the democratic newspaper "People's News," the Hodogaya factory of Kanto Electric Company is working overtime day and night to produce gunpowder raw materials. Mizushima Industrial Company in Nishinari Ward, Osaka, is manufacturing incendiary bombs. Workers at the company, unwilling to manufacture weapons of murder and dissatisfied with intensified labor and low wages, held a strike.

Some of the Japanese monopoly groups have already suffered the consequences of engaging in military production for the American aggressors. According to a report from the United Press, since the US war of aggression against Korea, the Japanese train car industry has blindly produced a large number of train cars for the invading American army. However, after the US military suffered a disastrous defeat, it reduced its purchases of train cars, resulting in serious unsalable products for companies such as "Nippon Sharyo" and "Train Manufacturing." According to a survey by the Japanese car industry, by the end of last year, the total value of unsalable train cars throughout Japan had reached about 1.8 billion yen. These vehicles are all manufactured according to the track width of Korea and cannot be used in Japan.

### 在美国占领当局指使下  日工业转向军事生产  大阪一公司工人反对制造杀人武器

    日工业转向军事生产
    大阪一公司工人反对制造杀人武器
    【新华社十一日讯】据联合通讯社消息：日本战时制造飞机的中心地区东海地方（本州中部东南沿海地区），现在正以纺织、化学等业为中心，急剧地转向军事生产。在美国占领当局的指使下，“三井化学”、“东洋人造丝”、“日本合成”、“吴羽纺织”、“仓敷纺织”、“大日本纺织”等十四家垄断企业，都被吸收到爱知县的前军需工厂中来。对这些工厂的投资达二百亿日元。以爱知县的纤维工业为例，战后原仅有工厂一百五十家，织机六千台；而截至去年十一月为止，工厂大量增加，织机增至九千九百台，成为日本最大的军用被服供应地。在化学工业方面，三井化学公司名古屋工厂、“日本合成”、“东洋人造丝”等公司也都在生产军用品。此外，在金属工业方面，“日产”汽车公司吉原工场在为“警察后备队”制造军用车辆，丰田汽车公司在一九五○及五一两会计年度中将为“警察后备队”制造吉普车四千五百辆。富士产业公司丰田工厂在制造装甲车，该公司的四日市工厂则在制造炮弹。神户制钢公司在为“海上保安厅”制造探照灯。萱场产业公司在生产大炮零件。三重珐琅公司则在制造钢盔。
    又据民主报纸《人民新闻》消息，关东电气公司保土谷工厂，连日加班，生产火药原料。大阪市西成区的水岛工业公司在制造燃烧弹。该公司工人因为不愿制造杀人武器，并不满加强劳动与低工资，曾举行怠工。
    日本垄断集团中已有一部分因为美国侵略者从事军需生产而自食恶果。据联合通讯社讯，自美国侵朝战争以来，日本火车车辆工业即盲目为侵朝美军大量生产。但美军自遭到惨败后，即减少采购火车车辆，因此使“日本车辆”、“火车制造”等公司的生产品便发生严重的滞销现象。据日本车辆工业界的调查，截至去年年底止，全日滞销火车车辆总值已达十八亿日元左右。这些车辆都是按照朝鲜的轨道宽度制造的，在日本国内无法使用。
