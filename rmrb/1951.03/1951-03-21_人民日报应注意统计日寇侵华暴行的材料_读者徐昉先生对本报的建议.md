　　People's Daily Should Pay Attention to Compiling Materials on the Atrocities of Japanese Imperialism's Invasion of China
    ——Reader Mr. Xu Fang's Suggestion to This Newspaper

To the Editors:

    To this day, what are the exact figures for the enormous losses of life and property suffered by the people of China during the eight years of Japanese imperialist aggression? It seems there is still no close to accurate statistics. As far as I know, in the documents that remain today, whether official archives or things like "Yearbooks" (before 1949), the most necessary records are just a few words, vaguely handled. This is not only a missing page in the heroic history of the broad masses of people resisting foreign aggression, but also an unwarranted carelessness and omission in the entire historical literature of the Chinese nation!

    I feel that today, as American imperialism is plotting to rearm Japanese imperialism and conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, it would be very meaningful to draw up a clear account of the bloody facts of the Japanese imperialists' trampling and massacring of our compatriots, and to appeal this blood debt to the peace-loving people of the world, so that we can work together to prevent conspiracies to expand the scourge of war and repeat the atrocities of aggression. However, this national statistical work mainly requires the people to help the government to investigate and provide materials of what they have seen and heard as reliable evidence. Although newspapers and publications in various places have recently published articles on this topic, they are all fragmentary and scattered, making it difficult to compile them. Therefore, I presumptuously suggest to you: that your newspaper should call on all my Chinese compatriots, both at home and abroad, to write down truthfully and simply what they know or have seen about the atrocities of Japanese imperialist aggression against China, and send them to your newspaper for centralized publication. Those who are literate should help those who are illiterate to describe their experiences, and it is even better to attach pictures. Then, your newspaper should publish special pages on a regular basis, and accumulate the numbers of various atrocities and losses, and classify and statistically analyze them. This work should be jointly launched by propaganda workers, correspondents, winter schools, newspaper reading groups, blackboards, etc., in various places, so as to be universal and in-depth. I think: this is a hatred that every Chinese people can never forget, and will surely provide countless pieces of true evidence to further prove the unspeakable atrocities of the Japanese imperialists.
                                            Reader Xu Fang

    Editor's note: Reader Mr. Xu Fang's opinion is worthy of attention. We sincerely hope that the broad masses of readers can provide us with as much material as possible about the atrocities of Japanese imperialist aggression against China for publication.

### 人民日报应注意统计日寇侵华暴行的材料——读者徐昉先生对本报的建议

　　人民日报应注意统计日寇侵华暴行的材料
    ——读者徐昉先生对本报的建议编辑同志：
    直到今天为止，我们对于日寇侵华八年间，全中国各地人民的生命财产的巨大损失，到底达到怎样的数字？似乎还没有一个接近精确的统计。据我所知，在目前留下来的文件中，不管是官方档案，还是如“年鉴”（一九四九年以前的）之类，于最必要记载的地方，都是寥寥数语，含糊了事，这不但是广大人民英勇抗御外侮的抗日战史上一个缺页，同时也是我中华民族整个历史文献上的一个不应有的粗疏和漏略！
    我觉得，在美帝国主义阴谋重新武装日寇，单独缔结对日和约的今天，如将日寇蹂躏虐杀我国同胞的惨痛事实开列一笔明白的血账，并将此血账申诉于全世界爱好和平的人民之前，来共同努力阻止阴谋扩大战祸和重演侵略的暴行，是非常有意义的。但这个全国统计工作，主要是要人民帮助政府来调查，提供所见所闻的材料，作为确实的证据。最近各地报纸刊物虽有这项文字发表，但均嫌零碎分散，汇辑不易。所以，我不揣浅薄地向你们建议：由贵报号召一下，凡我中华同胞不论在国内和海外，都希望能就其所见所闻，把自己知道或看到的一些日寇侵华暴行，简单明了的如实写下来，寄由贵报集中发表。识字的帮助不识字的代述，附有图片尤好。然后由贵报按期出版专页，并累积各种暴行、损失的数字，予以分类统计。这个工作，最好能由各地宣传员、通讯员、冬学、读报组、黑板报……联合发动，以求普遍深入。我想：这是中国人民每一个人所永远不能忘记的仇恨，一定会供给无数件真实的凭据，以增加证实罄竹难书的日寇暴行于万一的。
                                            读者  徐昉
    编者按：读者徐昉先生的意见，是值得重视的。我们很希望广大读者能够尽可能提供给我们有关日寇侵华暴行的材料，以备刊用。
