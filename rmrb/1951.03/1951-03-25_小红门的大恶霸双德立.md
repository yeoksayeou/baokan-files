　　Shuang Deli, this despotic landlord, was a traitor during the Japanese occupation and a Kuomintang secret agent during the Nationalist rule. He domineeringly served as the head of the bao (a local administrative unit) for thirteen years. He seized farmers' land and houses, beat and scolded them at will, and even treated kicking and forcing farmers to death as a joke. In the Xiaohongmen area outside Zuo'anmen in the suburbs of Beijing, even seven-year-old children would shiver at the mention of "Third Master Shuang".

　　Gao Shun, who worked as a farmhand in Shuang Deli's house for twenty-three years, was kicked to death by Shuang Deli. In February 1943, Old Gao was grinding flour in the mill when the mule became unruly, jumped around, ran into the pigpen, and got stuck in the manure pit and drowned. Shuang Deming, Shuang Deli's older brother, then severely whipped Old Gao with a large rope used to tie livestock. When Shuang Deli returned, he angrily pointed a gun at Old Gao and shouted, "The mule is dead, good, I'll shoot you!" Old Gao knelt down and begged. He grabbed him, kicking and beating him, and kicked Old Gao in the lower part of his body. A scream was heard, and Old Gao could no longer move. But he wasn't dead yet. Shuang Deli ordered people to drag Old Gao into a small dark room, forbidding anyone to give him food or drink. Old Gao struggled for two more days before dying. Shuang Deli ordered people to carry the corpse out and fired three shots into the sky to suppress the anger of the nearby farmers. That's how Old Gao died! He had worked hard in the Shuang family for twenty-three years, and the eighty-odd silver dollars and some pants and jackets he had painstakingly saved were all swallowed by Shuang Deli.

　　Farmers in Xiaohongmen Village said, "Shuang Deli kills people without shedding blood," which is absolutely true. He would use all sorts of methods to seek wealth and harm lives. He helped his mother-in-law seize the house and furniture of the poor peasant Zhao Binggeng and imprisoned Zhao's brother's wife in the bao office. Zhao Binggeng couldn't vent his anger and died of bloating. When he was dying, he said to his family, "After I die, you must avenge me!" But at that time, the "government" was supporting Shuang Deli; wouldn't a poor peasant who went to sue Shuang Deli be asking for trouble?

　　Gao En-hui is one example. During the Japanese occupation, he had accused Shuang Deli of corruption. Shuang Deli held a grudge and always wanted revenge. One day, Gao En-hui met Shuang Deli's uncle, Shuang Yong, and didn't bow or greet him. Shuang Yong beat him severely. But Shuang Deli was still not satisfied. During the Nationalist rule, he had Gao En-hui's son, Gao Wenyuan, arrested and taken to the Nanyuan Detention Center, where he was held for eight days. He used all sorts of methods to scare the child, making him seriously ill. After Gao En-hui paid money to redeem his child, he died in a few days.

　　The hired worker Han Dezhen, who was watching the crops for Shuang Deli, was kidnapped by bandits. The bandits asked Shuang Deli to pay money for his ransom, but he ignored them. As a result, the bandits "tore up the ticket" and killed Han Dezhen. Shuang Deli said, "What's so important about a stinking laborer dying!"

　　Besides the blood debts, Shuang Deli's oppression of the farmers was even more uncertain and countless. It was commonplace for him to hang and beat farmers. Farmers had to bow and call him "Third Master Shuang" when they met him. One day, the wife of the poor peasant Chen Yushan met him on the road, but because she was carrying a large firewood basket and couldn't bend over, she didn't bow, so he beat her severely. He usually falsely accused Wang Zichang, who repaired bicycles, of selling stolen bikes. Wang Zichang defended himself a few times and was dragged to the police station to be severely beaten. Even now, Wang Zichang has many large scars on his buttocks; his wife was also frightened into a mental breakdown.

　　There are many vegetable gardens outside Zuo'anmen. During the harvest season, all the farmers in the village had to take turns watching Shuang Deli's vegetable cellar. Standing in the wind late at night, if they dozed off even slightly and were seen by his lackeys, they would be severely beaten and arrested and imprisoned in the police station. He also stipulated that farmers who did not pay their "land tax" in full were not allowed to harvest their vegetables. Therefore, when the harvest season came, the farmers were worried to the point of crying. The poor peasant Li Chunshan just watched helplessly as his cabbages froze in the ground. If the cabbages couldn't be harvested, the whole family would have to go hungry. But Shuang Deli didn't care whether you had food to eat or not; you had to give him gifts during the New Year and holidays. If you didn't give gifts, he would make things difficult for you in every way. During the Nationalist rule, Chen Qingrong, the son of the poor peasant Chen Yushan, was drafted into the army three times by him, and each time he was redeemed with money. But on the night of Chen Qingrong's wedding, he was still taken away. Chen Yushan's wife was driven mad by this.

　　Relying on his evil power, Shuang Deli came up with various methods to extort money from the people: grain carts passing through Xiaohongmen had to pay vehicle tax; those doing business at the market had to give him money; he also levied road tax, slaughter tax, and elementary school start-up fees... The amount he embezzled is countless, but it is only known that when he was not the head of the bao, his family had only eighteen mu of land and one house. By the time of the land reform after liberation, he actually had more than ninety mu of land (including thirty mu of vegetable garden) and five houses. All of these properties were accumulated from the tears and blood of the farmers.

　　After the liberation of Beijing, the farmers stood up and turned over. The farmers of Xiaohongmen Village jointly wrote a letter of accusation. They said: "We, the people of the whole village, have suffered for more than ten years. The people's fat and blood have been sucked dry by them. All of our villagers have been subjected to their insults and beatings. We can no longer tolerate it. We are united and determined to eradicate this scourge, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal." Today, the farmers have received the support of the people's own government and want to settle the blood debts with Shuang Deli, demanding that the murderer pay for his life and avenge those who died!

### 小红门的大恶霸双德立

　　小红门的大恶霸双德立
    王敬
    双德立，这个恶霸地主，在日寇统治时代是汉奸，在国民党统治时代是军统特务。他称雄称霸地当了十三年大保长。霸占农民的土地、房屋，随便打骂农民，甚至拿踢死、逼死农民当闹着玩儿。在北京郊区左安门外小红门一带，提起“双三爷”来，连七岁小孩都打哆嗦。
    在双德立家里当了二十三年长工的高顺，就是被双德立踢死的。一九四三年二月，老高在磨房里磨面，因为骡子不老实，乱跳乱跑，跑进猪圈，陷在粪坑里淹死了。双德立的哥哥双德名，当时就用拴牲口的大绳子，把老高狠狠抽了一顿。双德立回来，拿着手枪，怒气冲冲地对着老高，大喊道：“骡子死了，好，我枪毙你！”老高跪下央求。他揪过来连踢带打，对准老高的下部踢了一脚，只听得一声惨叫，老高便不能动弹了。可是还没有死。双德立叫人把老高拖进小黑屋，不许人给他吃喝。老高又折腾了两天才死去。双德立叫人把尸首抬出去，他向天放了三枪，来压住附近农民的愤怒。老高就这样死了！他在双家扛了二十三年活，辛辛苦苦攒下的八十多块现洋和一些裤、袄，也都被双德立吞没了。
    小红门村的农民说：“双德立杀人不见血”，真是一点也不差。他会使种种方法，图财害命。他帮助他的丈母娘，霸占贫农赵秉庚的房子和家具，把赵的兄弟媳妇押在保公所。赵秉庚这口闷气没法出，得气臌病死了。他临死的时候，对家里人说：“我死以后，你们要给我报仇！”可是，那时的“衙门”，是给双德立撑腰的；贫农去告双德立，还不是找罪受吗？
    高恩惠就是一个例子。他在日寇统治的时候，曾告过双德立贪污。双德立怀恨在心，总想报复。有一天，高恩惠碰见双德立的叔叔双勇，没有向他鞠躬，招呼他，双勇就把他毒打一顿。可是双德立还没有出气。到国民党统治时，他把高恩惠的儿子高文元抓到南苑拘留所，押了八天，用种种手段吓唬这孩子，把孩子吓的得了重病。等到高恩惠用钱把孩子赎回来，不多几天就死了。
    雇工韩德祯，给双德立看青，被土匪绑去。土匪叫双德立拿钱去赎，他理也不理。结果，土匪“撕了票”，把韩德祯杀死了。双德立说：“一个臭扛活的，死了有甚了不起！”
    双德立除了血债以外，欺压农民的事，更是说不定，数不清。吊打农民，在他是家常便饭。农民们遇见他，须鞠躬喊“双三爷”。贫农陈玉山的老婆，有一天在路上碰见他，因为背着大柴筐，弯不下腰，没有鞠躬，就被他痛打一顿。他平日诬赖修自行车的王子长卖黑车，王子长分辩几句，就被拖到警察所去毒打。到如今王子长的屁股上，还有许多大伤疤；他老婆也吓成了干气疯。
    左安门外菜园子很多，收菜时，全村农民得轮流给双德立看菜窖。在深夜里迎风站着，如果稍一打盹，叫狗腿子看见，就要吃一顿毒打，并且被抓进警察所押起来。他又规定：不交齐“田粮”的农民，不许收菜。所以一到收菜季节，农民们就愁得哭。贫农李春山，就是眼巴巴地看着白菜冻在地里了。白菜收不上，一家人就得挨饿。可是双德立不管你有没有饭吃，到过年过节，必得给他送礼。要不送礼，他会百般刁难你。在国民党统治时，贫农陈玉山的儿子陈庆荣，被他三次抓兵，每次都是用钱赎回来。可是在陈庆荣结婚的那天晚上，还是给抓走了。陈玉山的老婆因此急得发疯。
    双德立仗着恶势力，想出各种方法来敲诈民财：粮车经过小红门，要缴车税；集上作买卖的，得给他拿用钱；他还征收过路税、屠宰税、小学开办费……他贪污的数目都计算不清了，只知道他在没当保长的时候，家里才有十八亩地和一所房子，到解放后土地改革时，他竟有九十多亩地（其中菜园三十亩），五所房子。他这些财产，都是农民的眼泪和鲜血积起来的。
    北京解放后，农民翻身站起来了，小红门全村农民，联名写了控诉书。他们说：“我等全村人民，已受害十余年矣。民脂民血，已被彼等吸尽。凡我村民，无一不受其辱打者。我等忍无可忍，团结一致，誓必铲除此害群之马，不达目的不止。”今天，农民们得到了人民自己的政府的支持，要向双德立清算血债，要求杀人者偿命，给死了的人们报仇！
