Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 8th, TASS: A Reuter correspondent in London reports: The British government has convened its representatives from various locations in the Far East for a meeting in London. Participants will include Malcolm MacDonald, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, Harding, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Land Forces, and Duncan, the British War Office's representative in Hong Kong.

The correspondent writes: In addition to discussing war preparations, the London meeting will also discuss resisting American infiltration into Southeast Asian countries. Britain is particularly concerned about American plans to secure Japan's dominant position in the Southeast Asian market.

Britain, as well as the Netherlands and France, face a dilemma: on the one hand, they need American aid to carry out aggression and suppress the national liberation movements in colonial countries; on the other hand, this aid comes at the cost of American infiltration into their previously exclusive colonial territories. The correspondent points out that the London meeting of British representatives from the Far East is intended to resolve this unresolvable problem.

　　东南亚英美矛盾日趋尖锐
    英国召集驻远东代表开会
    准备抵抗美国渗入东南亚
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社布拉格八日讯：电通社驻伦敦记者报道：英国政府已召集其驻远东各地的代表在伦敦开会。参加会议的将有英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳、英国驻远东陆军总司令哈丁、英国陆军部驻香港代表丹肯。
    该记者写道：伦敦会议除讨论战争准备外，还将讨论抵抗美国对东南亚各国的渗入问题。英国对美国计划确保日本在东南亚市场上的统治地位，特别感到焦心。
    英国以及荷兰和法国都面临着进退两难的境地：一方面需要美国的援助，以实行侵略、镇压殖民地国家的民族解放运动；而另一方面，这一援助又是以美国对它们以前所独占的殖民地领地的渗入为代价换来的。该记者指出，英驻远东代表的伦敦会议，就是想要解决这个无法解决的问题。
