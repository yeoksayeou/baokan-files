Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Japanese Socialist Party has reissued a statement insisting on its opposition to rearmament and demand for comprehensive peace. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, emphasized when meeting with a group of reporters in Maebashi on the 5th that the Socialist Party opposes rearmament and stated that under no circumstances would it amend its principles of demanding comprehensive peace and opposing the provision of military bases. He said: We "should not advocate the separate peace treaty theory and rearmament theory advocated by the government and Ashida of the Democratic Party." Asanuma Inejirō, the party's secretary-general, made a similar statement in Hiroshima on the 6th.
　　
Trade union and farmers' association organizations under the influence of the Socialist Party have also expressed opposition to rearmament. At its national conference on the 4th, the Japan Farmers Association passed an emergency resolution opposing the rearmament of Japan. On February 9, the Osaka local organization of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also passed, by an overwhelming majority, an emergency motion proposed by the local teachers and staff union demanding comprehensive peace, opposing rearmament, and striving for Japanese independence at its inaugural meeting. Some trade unions in Osaka City belonging to the Japanese Federation of Trade Unions, such as the trade unions of "Matsuo Bridge," "Osaka Books," "Kokko Lock Manufacturing," and "Nagata Shipbuilding" companies, have decided to participate in the comprehensive peace movement.
　　
Sawahara Chujiro, a Liberal Party member and former candidate for the House of Councillors residing in the Minami ward of Osaka City, recently responded to the call of the local Japanese Communist Party branch and signed a petition demanding comprehensive peace. He said: "Although I am a Liberal Party member, I also believe that the current (Liberal) Party's style is to despise the feelings of the people."

　　日本社会党再次发表声明
    要求全面媾和反对重新武装
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：日本社会党再次声明该党坚持反对重新武装与要求全面媾和的主张。社会党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎于五日在前桥地方会见记者团时，强调说明社会党反对重新武装，并表示在任何形势下决不修改该党要求全面媾和与反对提供军事基地的原则。他说：我们“不应该倡导政府和民主党芦田所说的单独媾和论与重整军备论”。该党总书记浅沼稻次郎于六日在广岛也作了类似的声明。
    社会党影响下的工会与农会组织也都表示反对重新武装。日本农民协会在四日的全国会议中，通过了反对重新武装日本的紧急决议。二月九日，日本工会总评议会的大阪地方组织在举行成立大会时，也以压倒多数通过了当地教职员工会所提的要求全面媾和、反对重新武装、争取日本独立的紧急动议。属于日本工会总同盟的大阪市的一些工会，如“松尾桥梁”、“大阪书籍”、“国光制锁”、“永田造船”等公司的工会，都决定参加全面媾和运动。
    居住在大阪市南区的自由党员、前参议员候选人佐原忠次郎，最近也响应当地日本共产党支部的号召，签名要求全面媾和。他说：“我虽是自由党员，但也认为现在（自由）党的作风是蔑视国民的感情的”。
