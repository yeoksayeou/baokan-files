　　US, British, and French Amendments to the "Occupation Statute" for West Germany
	Plot to accelerate West Germany's participation in aggressive blocs
Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The US, British, and French High Commissioners for Germany announced on March 6th amendments to the so-called "Occupation Statute" for West Germany, permitting the Bonn government to "immediately establish" a so-called "Federal Foreign Office" and to "establish direct diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic representatives" with countries of the imperialist bloc. A communique issued by the High Commissioners announced that the purpose of this measure was to "accelerate" West Germany's "joining the society of free nations." In essence, this is to give West Germany a more "independent" guise in order to prepare the ground for drawing it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. As early as February 25th, Byroade, Director of the German Affairs Office of the US State Department, bluntly admitted in a radio broadcast that the Bonn government must be given greater "political freedom" so that West Germany could "play its planned role in European defense." According to a report by the Associated Press, Washington diplomatic officials have also openly stated that after the implementation of the "new occupation statute," the Bonn government will be allowed to establish a "security police force." Obviously, these measures by the US and British groups are a prelude to the large-scale establishment of West German regular mercenary forces.
	Even the US, British, and French imperialist elements have to admit that the so-called "diplomatic power" obtained by the Bonn government has no "independence" or "freedom" to speak of. The US Associated Press reported that so-called "reliable sources" stated that West Germany's "control over its own diplomatic affairs must be placed under the supervision of the Allies." A dispatch from Bonn by Agence France-Presse on March 2nd even admitted that "the amended Occupation Statute will allow the Allies to regulate West Germany more flexibly without reducing the powers of the High Commissioners." Not only that, but the US, Britain, and France also used this so-called diplomatic power trick to extract a significant price from the West German people through the Adenauer government. At the same time as the US, Britain, and France announced the amendment of the "Occupation Statute," the Bonn government submitted a written statement to the three countries, acknowledging Germany's pre-war and post-war debts to the West, and guaranteeing "to contribute all necessary scarce materials to assist in joint defense." In this way, the US, Britain, and France have further intensified their economic control and exploitation of West Germany.
	On the one hand, the US, Britain, and France, under pressure from the Soviet Union's insistence and the pressure of the people of various countries, had to agree to convene a four-power foreign ministers' conference to negotiate the issue of eliminating West German militarism; on the other hand, they simultaneously took the above illegal measures, clearly exposing their intention to accelerate the arming of West Germany and impose a fait accompli on the four-power foreign ministers' conference. In this regard, a Reuters dispatch on February 24th revealed: "Washington officials said that the United States is willing to participate in any four-power conference, but has decided to proceed with the rearmament of Germany according to the original plan, regardless of Russia's opposition. Acheson has decided that there should be absolutely no hesitation on this point."

### 美英法修改对西德“占领法规”  图使西德加速参加侵略集团

　　美英法修改对西德“占领法规”
    图使西德加速参加侵略集团
    【新华社十一日讯】美、英、法三国驻德高级专员公署已于三月六日宣布修改三国对西德的所谓“占领法规”，准许波恩政府“立即成立”所谓“联邦外交部”，并与帝国主义集团各国“建立直接外交关系，交换外交代表”。三国高级专员公署发表的公报宣布：这一措施的目的，是为了“加速”使西德“加入自由国家社会”。这实质上就是给西德以更“独立”一些的伪装，以便为把它拉入北大西洋侵略集团准备基础。早在二月二十五日，美国国务院德国司司长拜娄德即曾在广播中直言不讳地供认：必须给予波恩政府更大的“政治自由”，以使西德能“在欧洲防务中起它计划中的作用”。另据合众社透露：华盛顿外交官员还曾公然表示在实行“新占领法规”后，将容许波恩政府设立“保安警察队”。显然，美英集团的这些措施将是大规模建立西德正规雇佣军的先声。
    甚至在美、英、法帝国主义分子方面也不得不承认，波恩政府获得的所谓“外交权”，实际上并无“独立”与“自由”之可言。美国合众社报道所谓“消息可靠”的外交人士称：西德“对其本身外交事务的控制权，必须置于盟国监督之下”。法新社三月二日从波恩发出的消息更承认：“修改了的占领法规将使盟国可以更灵活地管制西德，而毫不减少高级专员公署的权力。”不仅如此，美、英、法三国还利用这种所谓外交权的花样，通过阿登纳政府向西德人民索取了重大的代价。就在美英法三国宣布修改“占领法规”同时，波  恩政府即向三国提出了书面声明，承认战前及战后的德国对西方所负的债务，并且保证“准备贡献各种必需的稀有的物资，以协助联合防务”。这样，美、英、法三国就进一步加紧了对西德经济上的控制和榨取。
    美、英、法三国一方面迫于苏联的坚持与各国人民的压力，而不得不同意召开四国外长会议以谈判肃清西德军国主义的问题；另一方面却又在同时采取上项非法措施，明显地暴露了他们的目的是要加紧武装西德，而以既成事实强加诸于四外长会议。对此，路透社二月二十四日电曾透露：“华盛顿官员称：美国愿意参加任何一个四国会议，但决定不顾俄国的反对，按照原定计划进行德国的重新武装。艾奇逊已决定，关于这一点绝对不应有任何犹豫。”
