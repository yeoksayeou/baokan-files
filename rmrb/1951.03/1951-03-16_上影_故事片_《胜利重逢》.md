Young farmer Geng Hailin is from Liujia Village in Henan. He has been fond of Yin Xing, the daughter of Ji Laodie, since childhood. Geng Deye, Hailin's uncle, decided to mortgage the one acre and eight fen of land left by Hailin's father to the landlord Chai Dadu because his children had all grown up, hoping to get cash to handle the wedding. However, Chai Dadu colluded with Cui Baozhang, fabricated witnesses, and privately set up a court, claiming that Hailin's father had used one of his coffins when he died. In this way, through unreasonable coercion and torture, he swallowed Hailin's one acre and eight fen of land for nothing. Although the two elders were indignant, they eventually found a way to let Hailin and Yin Xing get married. Not long after Hailin's marriage, he encountered the reactionaries conscripting soldiers in the village. Chai Dadu's nephew was also conscripted, but he bribed the bandit army officer, making Hailin replace his nephew, thus tearing apart a young couple. Hailin suffered in the bandit army.

The officers deducted military pay for business, and Hailin starved while acting as a slave. One day, the company commander ordered Hailin and Luo Zhiqing to carry a sedan chair to the city to pick up his mistress, Da Jinya. When Luo Zhiqing crossed the river, he slipped on a stone and unfortunately fell, throwing Da Jinya from the sedan chair into the water. His right foot was also injured. When he returned to the company headquarters, the company commander beat him and deducted three months' pay to compensate Da Jinya for her cheongsam. Hailin sympathized with Luo Zhiqing's plight, took two months of back pay and played cards with Squad Leader Ma Zi, hoping to win money to treat Zhiqing's foot injury, but ended up losing it all to those gamblers.

In 1944, the Japanese army invaded south of the Yellow River to open the Beijing-Hankou Railway. The bandit army was ordered to retreat to the rear. Luo Zhiqing's foot injury became more serious, and he was still carrying goods for the officers when he was knocked down by an officer's family car rushing around. The cannibalistic company commander saw that he couldn't walk and shot him dead on the side of the road; Hailin witnessed the tragic scene and was greatly stimulated.

After Japan surrendered, American imperialism drove the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a large-scale attack on the liberated areas. Hailin was also sent to the Northeast and was luckily liberated by the Northeast Democratic Allied Army before reaching his destination.

    青年农民耿海林，是河南刘家峁人。从小就和纪老爹的女儿银杏要好。海林的大伯耿大爷因儿女们都长大了，决定把海林爹遗下的一亩八分地押给地主柴大肚，希望得了现款好办喜事。柴大肚却勾结崔保长，自造人证，私立公堂，说海林爹死时曾用过他一口棺材。就这样凭无理胁迫和非刑拷打，把海林的一亩八分地白白给吞噬了。两老虽然气愤不过，可是最后还是想了办法让海林和银杏成了亲。海林新婚不久又遇反动派在村里抽壮丁。柴大肚的侄子也抽中了，他贿赂了匪军军官，使海林顶替了他的侄子，这样便把一对青年夫妻硬给拆散了。海林在匪军里活受罪。
