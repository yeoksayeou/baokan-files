The Northeast Daily published a short commentary on the 11th, titled "Launch a Production Competition Among Mutual Aid Teams," calling on agricultural labor models and labor mutual aid teams throughout Northeast China to enthusiastically respond to the production challenge of Shanxi agricultural labor model Li Shunda.

The commentary pointed out: Last November, the Jilin agricultural labor model Han En mutual aid team initiated an agricultural production competition, which was responded to by mutual aid teams in various places, thus promoting rural production and other rural work last winter, with great results. On the basis of last winter's production competition, further expanding the challenge to the Li Shunda mutual aid team will help achieve this year's agricultural production tasks in Northeast China. The commentary also put forward the following opinions based on past experience in agricultural production competitions in Northeast China:

(1) Because the countryside is different from factories, and villages are not economic production units, the agricultural production competition movement should not be launched on a village-by-village basis. Instead, it should be based on mutual aid groups under the principle of voluntarism, while also attracting individual farmers ("single-handedly farming") to participate; otherwise, it is very likely to lead to formalism. (2) There are many complex situations in agricultural production. Therefore, the competition conditions must be realistic and adapted to local conditions, and should not pursue multiple, high, and perfect conditions. At the same time, strong leadership should be carried out, and the reasons should be explained clearly during mobilization. Labor models, mutual aid teams, and other participants should be helped to specifically study their own production conditions and formulate practical plans; avoid empty slogans or seeking temporary excitement, appearing grand on the surface, but actually not solving any problems. (3) The leadership of the agricultural production competition movement should be based on different agricultural seasons, grasping the current key points. In the current situation in Northeast China, it is necessary to concentrate all efforts on preparing for spring plowing, overcoming various difficulties in preparing for spring plowing, and making the first step in striving for a bumper harvest this year. Therefore, while leading and organizing the production competition, a series of specific problems must be solved, such as fully supplying farmers with means of production. In this way, the competition movement can have a material basis. (4) Once the competition movement is launched, it must be adhered to and implemented to prevent it from fizzling out. This requires clear steps in leadership, constantly deepening the movement with the changes in the agricultural season, and paying special attention to solving the problems and difficulties that occur in different stages of the movement. (5) The purpose of launching the agricultural production competition is to give full play to the enthusiasm of all farmers, not just limited to certain labor models and excellent mutual aid teams. Therefore, the intense production actions of the farmers participating in the competition should lead the rest of the farmers; and we should not only pay attention to the farmers participating in the competition, so as not to neglect or relax the leadership of the production of the remaining farmers.

　　东北日报发表评论
    号召响应李顺达挑战
    根据农村具体情况提出五点建议
    东北日报于十一日以《开展互助组生产竞赛》为题发表短评，号召全东北各地农业劳动模范及劳动互助组，热烈响应山西农业劳动模范李顺达的生产挑战。
    短评中指出：去年十一月吉林农业劳动模范韩恩互助组发起农业生产竞赛，得到了各地互助组的响应，因而推动了去年冬季的农村生产及其他农村工作，收到很大效果。在去冬生产竞赛的基础上，进一步展开向李顺达互助组的应战，将有助于实现今年东北的农业生产任务。短评中并根据过去东北农业生产竞赛的经验，提出以下的意见：
    （一）由于农村不同于工厂，村屯不是一个经济生产单位，因此，农业生产竞赛运动，不应以村为单位来发动，而是要在自觉自愿的原则下，以互助小组为基础，同时也吸引单独耕作的农民“单干户”参加；否则就很有可能产生形式主义。（二）农业生产中有许多复杂情况，因此竞赛条件必须切合实际，因地制宜，不应追求条件多、条件高和完美无缺。同时，又应进行有力的领导，动员时要说清道理，要帮助劳动模范和互助组及其他参加者具体地研究本身的生产条件，订出切实可行的计划；切忌空泛号召或贪图一时热闹，表面轰轰烈烈，而实际并不能解决什么问题。（三）农业生产竞赛运动的领导，要依据不同的农业季节，抓住当前主要的关键。以目前东北地区的情况来说，就是要集中全力作好准备春耕工作，克服准备春耕中的各种困难，为争取今年丰收作好第一步工作。因此，领导与组织生产竞赛的同时，必须解决一连串具体问题，比如充分供应农民生产资料之类。这样，竞赛运动才能有物质基础。（四）竞赛运动一经展开之后，务求坚持贯彻下去，防止虎头蛇尾。这就要求在领导上有明确的步骤，随着农业季节的变化而不断把运动深入下去，特别应注意解决运动不同阶段中所发生的问题和困难。（五）展开农业生产竞赛的目的，在于充分发挥全体农民的积极性，而不只是限于某些劳动模范和优秀的互助组。因此，就应当通过参加竞赛的农民的紧张生产的行动，带起其余的农民；而不要仅仅注意参加竞赛的农民，以致忽略了或放松了对其余农民生产的领导。
