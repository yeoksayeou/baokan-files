My Accusation Against American Imperialist Cultural Aggression
Qi Sihe, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Yenching University

Until recently, I still thought that American imperialist cultural aggression had nothing to do with me, and I even doubted whether cultural aggression was possible. Recently, as a result of participating in the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea, oppose Austin's fallacies, and eliminate American imperialist cultural aggression, I have gradually begun to recognize the essence of American imperialist cultural aggression. Consequently, I feel that I myself am a concrete example of American imperialist cultural aggression, and the poisoning I have suffered is much deeper than the accusations made by my fellow students these past few days.

Although I had not attended a missionary school before entering Yenching University, the school system at that time required us to study English from elementary school, and we used English textbooks in junior high school. It was after the war, and I read about the greatness of the United States and the awfulness of Germany and Austria in a geography textbook compiled by Americans. In high school, except for Chinese and Chinese history, all the textbooks were from the United States. Teachers prided themselves on being able to teach original books, and we ourselves felt very proud. When I went to university, the frogs and earthworms dissected in biology class were all from the United States. The teacher said that the frogs and earthworms on campus were different from those in the books. The political instructor talked about the American government with great relish; when we asked if he could also talk about the evolution of the Chinese political system, the instructor said that foreigners didn't recognize it. When I came to Yenching University, I was very happy that I could study directly with foreigners. A foreign teacher often said, "China has no hope!" I felt ashamed. He also taught us that the real reason for the Opium War was not opium, but the ignorance of the Chinese government in not allowing foreigners free trade. I felt ashamed again, how could China be so backward! Because the more I read modern history, the angrier I became, I switched to studying ancient Chinese history because I could escape reality. When I went to the United States, although I achieved my long-cherished wish to study abroad, seeing how Americans looked down on people of color increased my sense of inferiority. The deeper my education, the deeper my sense of inferiority. I felt that China really had no hope! After the "July 7th" Incident, Yenching University continued to operate as usual under the American flag. I hated the Japanese, but I was grateful to the Americans. When I saw the Japanese flag, I loathed it; but when I saw the American flag, I was grateful to it. After the victory, when I saw American planes and troops coming to North China, I was extremely excited. Although during the occupation, I hated the Japanese and the puppet regime, I refused all inducements and vowed not to cooperate with them. Although foreign soldiers were invading our territory, my views were so different. In the spring of 1948, the economy under the reactionary Kuomintang rule was on the verge of total collapse. An acquaintance initiated an open letter to the United States, calling for economic and military aid to China, and invited me to participate. I did not refuse. He said to me, "If American supplies don't come, won't the Chinese people starve to death?" I thought he was right. At that time, the Liberation War had already begun on a large scale. But someone said to me, "Aren't the Communists and the Kuomintang all Chinese? As long as they are Chinese, things will not be good. No country has ever been immortal! China cannot withstand another war." I thought he was right again! On the eve of liberation, someone warned me: "You participated in the declaration of the eighteen professors. You should leave quickly! It's best to go to America." Because I had been to the United States, I knew that I couldn't stand the Americans' arrogance, and I didn't want my children to become White Russians. But in principle, I still felt that seeking American aid was not wrong.

After liberation, I began to study progressive theories. At the same time, the facts told me that all the slanders I had heard about the Chinese Communist Party were malicious propaganda by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese Communist Party's spirit of hard work brought new hope to China, and my life also felt new meaning. American imperialism imposed an economic blockade on us, trying to undermine our economic construction, but our prices have stabilized, thoroughly solving the economic panic created by the Kuomintang reactionaries for many years. At the same time, how are the countries in Western Europe that are enslaved by American imperialism? They are even poorer, reduced to colonies of American imperialism, and have become tools of American imperialism's aggression. Only then did I realize the seriousness of my past mistakes. I understood that seeking American aid was being an enemy of the people, obstructing the emergence of a new China, and asking for help from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to massacre Chinese people! I felt that the mistakes I had made in the past were betraying the motherland and recognizing the enemy as a friend, a traitorous thought. I am sorry to the motherland, sorry to my compatriots, sorry to my own parents and children!

Therefore, I hate myself very much! How could I be so confused, so absurd? Especially as I pride myself on being a person who values national integrity, how could I unknowingly fall into their trap? What is the difference between American aid and the Japanese so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"? But I hate the term "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," while I felt that American aid was beneficial to us! I pride myself on being able to read books, but as the saying goes, "Reading clarifies principles." I have read many books, so how could I not understand such obvious principles? After liberation, the government did not pursue this matter, but I myself felt it was a very heavy psychological burden. The more I examined myself, the more ashamed I became.

Recently, as the movement to eliminate the poisonous elements of American imperialist culture unfolded, I heard the self-criticisms and accusations of my colleagues and students, and I thoroughly realized that my mistakes were caused by the poisoning of American imperialist cultural aggression. The books I read, apart from Chinese books, were almost all American books. The newspapers and magazines I read, apart from Chinese newspapers and magazines, were almost all American ones. Moreover, I thought that American imperialist newspapers and magazines were more objective and reliable. As a result, I looked at everything with American glasses, and I became an unconscious prisoner of American imperialist thought. Now I am beginning to wake up. Because I am investigating the source of the poisonous elements in my thinking, I hate these bloodless murderers, the traffickers of ideological poisons. I want to accuse American imperialism of its insidious and vicious cultural aggression against us for decades! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 我对于美帝国主义文化侵略的控诉

　　我对于美帝国主义文化侵略的控诉
    燕京大学文学院院长  齐思和
    直到最近以前，我犹以为美帝国主义文化侵略和我没有关系，我甚至怀疑文化侵略是否可能。最近因为参加抗美援朝、反对奥斯汀谰言和肃清美帝国主义文化侵略等运动的结果，使得我对于美帝国主义文化侵略的本质渐渐地开始认识，因而感觉到我自己便是美帝国主义文化侵略一个具体的例证，而所受的毒害比连日同学们所控诉的更深得多。
    我虽在入燕京以前没上过教会学校，但是当时的学制从小学时期就读英文，初中便读英文课本，当时正在大战以后，我从美国人编的地理课本中念到了美国的伟大，德、奥的可恶。到了高中，除了国文、中国史几门功课外，课本全是美国来的，教员以能教原版书自负，我们自己也觉得很骄傲。上了大学，生物班解剖的青蛙、蚯蚓全是美国来的，教员说因为校园中的青蛙、蚯蚓和书上的不同。政治教员讲美国政府，津津有味；我们问是否也可说一说中国政治制度的沿革，教员说人家外国人不承认。来到燕京，自己很高兴，可以跟洋人直接念书了。一位外国教员常说：“中国没有希望！”我觉得惭愧。他又教给我们，鸦片战争的真正原因不是鸦片，而是中国政府愚昧，不准洋人自由通商；我又感觉惭愧，何以中国这样落后！因为读近世史越读越生气，我才改学中国古史，因为可以逃避现实。到了美国，虽然达到了出国留学的宿愿，但是目睹美国人对有色人种那样瞧不起，更增加了我的自卑感。我受的教育越深，自卑感也越深，我感到中国真是没希望！“七七”事变后，在美国的旗帜下，燕京还照常开学。我痛恨日本人，但是我感激美国人。我看见日本旗，我厌憎它；但是看到美国旗我便感激它。胜利后，我看到美国飞机、部队开到华北来，我兴奋得不得了。虽然在沦陷期间，我痛恨日本和伪政权，我拒绝了一切的利诱，誓不与他们合作。同是外国兵侵犯我们的领土，而我的看法就这样不同。一九四八年春天国民党反动派统治下的经济濒于总崩溃了，一位熟人发起向美国写一封公开的信，呼吁经济军事援华，邀我参加，我竟未加拒绝。他对我说：“美国物资不来，中国人还不饿死？”我觉得很对。当时解放战争已经大规模的开始了。但有人对我说：“共产党和国民党还不都是中国人。只要是中国人，就不会好的，自古无不亡之国！中国不堪再战了。”我又觉得很对！解放前夕，有人警告我：“你是参加十八教授宣言的，你赶快走罢！最好上美国。”我因去过美国，知道美国人的气是受不了的，我更不愿我的子女沦为白俄。但是原则上我还觉得争取美援并不算错。
    解放后，我开始学习进步性的理论了。同时事实告诉我以前听到关于对中国共产党的种种污蔑，全是美帝国主义和国民党反动派的恶意宣传。中国共产党埋头苦干的精神给中国带来了新的希望，我的生命也觉得有新的意义了。美帝国主义对我们施行经济封锁，图谋破坏我们的经济建设，然而我们的物价反而稳定了，彻底地解决了多少年来国民党反动派所造成的经济恐慌。同时，西欧被美帝国主义奴役的国家怎样呢？他们更加穷困了，沦为美帝国主义的殖民地了，成了美帝国主义的侵略工具了。于是我才觉悟我过去错误的严重，我明了了争取美援就是和人民为敌，就是要阻挡新中国的出现，就是要求帮助蒋介石匪帮残杀中国人！我感觉到过去所犯的错误，实在是背叛祖国，认敌为友的卖国思想。我对不起祖国，对不起同胞，对不起我自己的父母子女！
    因而我自己非常痛恨自己！我何以这样糊涂，这样荒谬？特别是我自负是讲究民族气节的人，何以不自觉的上了人家圈套？美援与日本人所谓“大东亚共荣圈”有什么区别？可是我痛恨“大东亚共荣圈”这种名辞，而对于美援我倒觉得于我们是有好处的！我自负是能读书的，但是常言道：“读书明理”，我读过不少书，怎么这样明显的道理我竟不明白呢？解放后，政府并没有追究过这一件事，但我自己觉得是一个很沉重的心理上的包袱，自己越检讨，自己越惭愧。
    最近肃清美帝国主义文化毒素的运动展开，我听到同仁同学们的检讨控诉，我才彻底觉悟了我的错误实在是受了美帝国主义文化侵略的毒害。我念的书除了中国书外，几乎都是美国书，我阅览的除了中国报章杂志外，几乎都是美国的；并且我以为美帝国主义的报章杂志比较客观可靠。因之，我带了一副美国眼镜看一切问题，我沦为美帝国主义思想上的俘虏而不自觉。现在我开始觉悟了，因为追究我思想上毒素的来源，我痛恨这些杀人不见血的刽子手，思想毒物的贩运者。我要控诉几十年来美帝国主义对我们阴狠毒辣的文化侵略！（新华社）
