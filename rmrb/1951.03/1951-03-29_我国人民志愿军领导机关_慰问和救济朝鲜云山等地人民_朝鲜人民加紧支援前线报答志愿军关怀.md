Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 28th -- The leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) sent personnel in January to comfort and relieve the people of five counties in northern Korea: Unsan, Pakchon, Taechon, Nyongbyon, and Kasan. This area was once occupied by the American invading army and the Rhee Syngman puppet army last year. Under the enemy's slaughter and looting, the lives and property of the local people suffered heavy losses. According to investigations, the population of the above-mentioned areas decreased by an average of 40 percent, most of whom were killed by the American and Rhee bandits, or were bombed to death by American aircraft, while a small number were coerced by the American and Rhee bandits to flee south. Many residents' houses were bombed or burned down by the enemy. In addition, furniture, cattle, livestock, etc., were also greatly lost. After suffering this catastrophe, the local people lived in extreme poverty.

After the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in coordination with the Korean People's Army, liberated the above-mentioned areas, the leading organs sent personnel in January of this year, carrying 400,000 catties of grain and a large number of letters of sympathy, to comfort and relieve the disaster-stricken people. With the assistance of the local Korean People's Government, the CPVA staff held many mass meetings to express their condolences to the Korean people and visited the families of the Korean People's Army soldiers and the families of martyrs individually. According to statistics from Nyongbyon, Kasan, and Taechon counties, they distributed 240,000 catties of relief grain; 3,798 households, totaling 17,357 people, received relief.

The Korean people, who received the warm sympathy and relief from the Volunteer Army, expressed their warm gratitude to the Volunteer Army. Many people said, "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army not only helps us fight the American robbers, but also cares about our lives. It is really a rare army in the world." They expressed their intention to repay the care and help given to them by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with actions to intensify support for the front lines. The chairman of the Songhwi-ri People's Committee of Pakchon County said, "We all know that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting bravely at the front for us, not hesitating to shed blood and sacrifice, and sometimes they don't even have enough to eat, but they save food to help our disaster-stricken people. The Korean people will never forget the great spirit of friendship of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for generations to come." The chairman of the Women's Alliance of Namsan-ri, Goseong Township, Nyongbyon County, said, "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army rescued our Korean women from the ravages of the American beasts, and now they have come to comfort and relieve us. We must work harder to produce and support you." Lee Sang-song, a model farmer from Goam-ri, Taechon County, said, "In order to repay the kindness of the Volunteer Army, I must work harder in this year's spring plowing, apply more fertilizer, produce more grain, and hand over more public grain to support the front lines in winning victories."

Many families of martyrs sadly accused the American and Rhee bandits of their crimes to the CPVA staff and demanded that the CPVA eliminate more enemies and avenge them. Kim Yong-chan, a family member of a martyr from Dongha-ri, Pakchon County, said, "With the Chinese People's Volunteer Army avenging me, I will no longer be sad. I must work hard to produce and support the front lines in fighting, and avenge my husband and thousands of others like my husband who were killed by the enemy!"

　　我国人民志愿军领导机关
    慰问和救济朝鲜云山等地人民
    朝鲜人民加紧支援前线报答志愿军关怀
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关于一月间派员慰问和救济了朝鲜北部云山、博川、泰川、宁边、价川等五郡人民。这个地区去年曾被美国侵略军和李伪军一度侵占。在敌人的屠杀和劫掠下，当地人民的生命财产蒙受了惨重损失。据调查，上述地区的人口平均减少了百分之四十，其中大部是被美、李匪军所屠杀，或是被美国飞机所炸死的，另有少数则被美、李匪军胁迫南逃。很多居民的房屋被敌人炸毁或烧掉。此外家具、耕牛、家畜等也损失极大。当地人民遭此浩劫以后，生活极为困苦。
    中国人民志愿军在配合朝鲜人民军将上述地区解放后，特于今年一月由领导机关派员携带粮食四十万斤和大批慰问信，前往该地慰问和救济受灾人民。志愿军的工作人员在当地朝鲜人民政府协助下，召开了多次群众大会，向朝鲜人民进行慰问，并个别访问了朝鲜人民军的家属和烈士家属。据宁边、价川、泰川三郡统计，他们发放了救济粮食二十四万斤；受到救济者达三千七百九十八户，共一万七千三百五十七人。
    受到志愿军的热情慰问和救济的朝鲜人民，对志愿军表示热烈感谢。很多人说：“中国人民志愿军不只帮助我们打美国强盗，还关心我们的生活，真是天下少见的军队。”他们表示要以加紧支援前线的行动，来报答中国人民志愿军所给予他们的关怀和帮助。博川郡松回里人民委员会委员长说：“我们都知道中国人民志愿军为了我们在前方英勇作战，不惜流血牺牲，有时还吃不饱饭，却省下粮食来救济我们受灾的老百姓。朝鲜人民子子孙孙都忘不了中国人民志愿军这种伟大的友爱精神。”宁边郡古城面南山里妇女同盟委员长说：“中国人民志愿军把我们朝鲜妇女从美国野兽的蹂躏下救了出来，现在又来慰问和救济我们，我们要更加努力生产，支援你们。”泰川郡古岩里模范农民李常松说：“为了报答志愿军的恩情，我在今年春耕中一定要多使劲，多上粪，多打粮食，多交公粮，来支援前线打胜仗。”
    许多烈士的家属，都悲愤地向志愿军工作人员控诉美、李匪军的罪行，要求志愿军消灭更多的敌人，替他们报仇。博川郡东下里烈士家属金龙赞说：“有中国人民志愿军替我报仇，我就不再伤心了。我一定要努力生产，支援前方打仗，替我丈夫和千千万万个像我丈夫这样被敌人杀害的人报仇！”
