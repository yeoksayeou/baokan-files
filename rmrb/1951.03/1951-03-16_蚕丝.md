　　Silkworm Silk
     Xiong Youjin
    Silkworm silk, along with wool, hemp, and cotton, are the four major natural raw materials for clothing.
    Sericulture is one of the important side occupations in rural areas, and in some regions, it is even the main occupation. In 1950, there were over one million sericultural households in the country. In counties with developed sericulture in Zhejiang, the value of cocoon production was almost equal to the county's agricultural tax burden. In some areas of Northeast China, raising tussah silkworms for two seasons often exceeded the total income of ordinary farmers by 50%.
    China's silk production is divided into mulberry silk and wild silk due to the different breeding methods and feed. Mulberry silkworms are fed with mulberry leaves and require a large amount of manual management. Wild silkworms are mostly fed with oak, tussah, horned, maple, and other tree leaves, and are raised on trees. The equipment required is very simple, and the labor required is also less, but the quality is also worse. Among wild silkworms, tussah silkworms account for the largest proportion. Due to the difference in breeding seasons, they are divided into spring silkworms, summer silkworms, and autumn silkworms, among which spring silkworms are the most widely distributed, and summer silkworms are the least. In the Jiangnan area and the tussah silkworm area, they are mostly raised twice in spring and autumn. In Guangdong, some are raised up to six times.
    Silkworm silk is China's main special product and export commodity, and silkworm rearing and silk extraction are China's very early inventions. According to the legend of the Yellow Emperor's consort, Lei Zu, teaching the people to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms, it is estimated that China's silk business has a history of more than 4,000 years. Regarding the improvement of silk, according to the "Tiangong Kaiwu" written by Song Yingxing of the Ming Dynasty, "If a white male is mated with a yellow female, its offspring will turn into brown cocoons." "...Some people mate early males with late females, and young seedlings produce excellent seeds..." This is a very scientific silkworm breeding method, which is what is known today as "hybrid breeding." Of course, the improvement of silk did not start from this time, but this is just one example with a relatively clear record.
    Silkworm silk production areas are almost all over the country. Except for a very few provinces, they are all raised. The production areas of mulberry silk are primarily along the Taihu Lake in East China, the Pearl River Delta in Central and South China, and the Sichuan Basin in Southwest China. The production areas of tussah silk are mainly in the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas. Based on this situation, the focus of mulberry silkworm areas is currently on Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other provinces; the focus of tussah silkworm areas is on Liaodong, Shandong, and Henan.
    Silkworm silk has a wide range of uses. Generally, it can be used for weaving clothes, embroidery, silk stockings, gloves, towels, water-resistant fishing nets, as well as surgical muscle sutures, wire wrapping, rubber core threads, and so on. In addition, it can also be used to manufacture military parachutes, protective materials and wings for military aircraft, hand grenade pull cords, and raw materials for explosives.
    China's silk exports are mainly mulberry silk, which began as early as the Han Dynasty when it communicated with the Western Regions. Since 1891 (the seventeenth year of Guangxu), the annual output has exceeded 10 million kilograms. In 1912, it increased to more than 15.8 million kilograms, and in 1928, it reached more than 20 million kilograms. Before 1930, silk always maintained the first place in China's export commodities. Later, the Japanese invaders robbed China's silk market with cheap Japanese silk on the one hand, and desperately promoted the poor quality and ungraded grades of China's silk in the international market to destroy the reputation of China's silk. American imperialism also took the opportunity to depress the purchase price of China's silk, so the export volume gradually decreased to more than 9 million kilograms. During the Anti-Japanese War, after the Japanese invaders occupied Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Henan, Anhui and other provinces, they adopted a policy of destroying China's silk industry, cutting down a large number of mulberry trees and oak trees, and destroying seed farms and silk factories. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital colluded with American imperialism and wantonly devastated the silk industry. Therefore, on the eve of liberation, China's silk industry was on the verge of extinction. Even according to an exaggerated estimate by the Kuomintang bandits in 1947, the annual output of raw silk in the country was only 74,200 piculs, which was less than a quarter of that before the war.
    After liberation, China's silk industry, which had been ravaged for nearly 20 years, gradually began to recover. In addition to providing loans, seed production, cocoon collection, technical guidance, and assistance in organizing mutual aid, local people's governments have also established specialized institutions to be responsible for management. Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, and Shandong have also convened representative meetings of silkworm farmers and sericultural research conferences. The purchase price is also relatively reasonable. For example, in East China, the price of improved fresh cocoons for spring silkworms is 3.5 shi of rice per picul (in 1947, the Kuomintang bandits stipulated that improved spring cocoons should be worth 4 shi of rice, but by the time the silkworm farmers received the money, it was not enough to buy 2 shi of rice). The Northeast People's Government also allowed the use of large cocoons to offset public grain, with 1,000 grains equivalent to 62 jin of public grain. The Nanyang Native Produce Company in Henan raised the purchase price of high-quality water silk to 96,000 yuan per jin. Local silkworm farmers reflected that "one jin of silk is better than planting one mu of land, and one cocoon can be exchanged for half a tael of salt. Our mountains of oak trees have become cash cows!" With great support, the sericulture industry in various places has recovered. In Shandong Province alone, the output of tussah silkworm spring cocoons in 1950 increased by four times compared with 1949, and autumn cocoons increased by six times. Most of the silk factories in Southern Jiangsu have resumed operations and have been able to obtain certain profits. Silk exports are also recovering. According to the sales statistics of the China Silk Company, the export volume of various raw silks in July last year reached 4,200 quintals, adding a considerable amount of foreign exchange to the country.
    This year, China's silk production has developed from maintaining the existing level to further improvement. The Government Administration Council clearly stipulated in the decision on agricultural and forestry production in 1951 that, on the basis of 1950, this year "increase mulberry silkworm cocoon production by 14.9%; increase tussah silkworm cocoon production by 56.8%." At the same time, silk was also included in agricultural production loans. From these specific measures of the People's Government, it can be affirmed that the development of China's silk industry has infinitely bright prospects in the future.

　　蚕丝
     熊尤今
    蚕丝与羊毛、麻类、棉花同为衣着的四大天然原料。
    养蚕是农村中重要的副业之一，有的地区，还是主业。一九五○年全国共有一百数十万蚕户，在浙江蚕桑业发达的县份，其产茧的价值，几与全县农业税的负担额相等；在东北有些地方一个人放养两期柞蚕，比普通农民一年的总收入，往往还要超出百分之五十。
    我国蚕丝的生产，因蚕的饲养方式和饲料的不同，有家蚕与野蚕之别。家蚕是以桑叶为饲料，并需用多量的人工管理；野蚕大都以栎、柞、桷、枫等树叶为饲料，系放养于树上，所需设备甚简，所费劳力亦少，但品质也较差。在野蚕中以柞蚕占最大比例。因饲育季节的差异，又分春蚕、夏蚕与秋蚕等种，其中以春蚕分布最广，夏蚕最少，在江南区和柞蚕区，大都于春秋饲养二次；广东区有的饲养达六次。
    蚕丝是我国的主要特产和出口物资，而且养蚕取丝是我国很早的发明，从黄帝元妃螺祖教民种桑养蚕的传说中估计，我国蚕丝的经营已有四千年以上的历史。关于蚕丝的改良，据明朝宋应星所著的《天工开物》中记载：“若将白雄配黄雌，则其嗣变成褐茧。”“……有将早雄配晚雌者，幼出嘉种……”。这是一个很科学的蚕种改良法，就是今天所谓的“杂交育种”。当然改良蚕丝远不是从这个时候开始，这不过是其中一个有较明确的记载的例子而已。
    蚕丝产区几满遍全国，除了极少数的省份外，都有饲养。家蚕丝的产区，首推华东区的太湖沿岸，中南区的珠江三角洲，西南区的四川盆地；柞蚕丝的产区，则以山东、辽东两半岛为主。依据这个情况，目前家蚕区以江苏、浙江、四川、广东等省为重点；柞蚕区以辽东、山东、河南为重点。
    蚕丝的用途很广。一般可用作织造衣服、刺绣、丝袜、手套、巾带、耐水渔网，以及外科肌肉缝线、电线包皮、胶皮蕊中线等等。此外还可用来制造军用降落伞、军事飞机护身材料和机翼、手榴弹拉线、炸药原料等。
    我国蚕丝出口，以家蚕丝为主，远在汉朝通西域时就已开始。自一八九一（光绪十七年）年后，每年输出量曾超过一千万公斤，一九一二年增至一千五百八十余万公斤，一九二八年曾达二千余万公斤。一九三○年以前，蚕丝在我国外销商品中，始终保持着第一位。以后，日寇一面以廉价日本丝来抢夺我国蚕丝市场；一面拚命在国际市场上肆意宣传我国蚕丝质劣、品级不分等等，以破坏我国蚕丝的信誉，而美帝国主义也趁机压价收购我国蚕丝，因此出口量逐渐降至九百余万公斤。抗战期间，日寇占领河北、山东、江苏、浙江、广东、湖北、河南、安徽等省后，又采取毁灭我国蚕丝的政策，大量砍伐桑树、栎树，破坏制种场、丝厂；抗战胜利后，国民党官僚资本与美帝国主义勾结，肆意摧残蚕丝业，因此，解放前夕，我国蚕丝事业已淹淹一息，就以一九四七年国民党匪帮的一个夸大估计来看，全国生丝年产量也只七万四千二百市担，还不及战前的四分之一。
    解放后，被摧残了近二十年的中国蚕丝事业，渐渐地开始恢复。各地人民政府，对蚕丝事业除贷款、制种、收茧、技术指导、帮助组织互助外，还成立了专业机构来负责管理。像浙江、苏南、山东还分别召开了蚕农代表会及蚕业研究会。在收购价格方面，也比较合理。如华东区对春蚕的改良鲜茧，每市担价格为大米三·五石（一九四七年，国民党匪帮曾定规改良春茧合大米四石，但等到蚕农拿到钱时，已不够买大米二石）；东北人民政府并许可用大茧顶交公粮，每千粒合公粮六十二斤；河南南阳土产公司收购上等水丝，每市斤提高到九万六千元，当地蚕农反映说：“一斤丝胜种一亩地，一个茧能换半两盐，咱们满山的栎毛子（柞墩）都变成摇钱树啦！”经过大力扶助，各地养蚕业获得了恢复。仅山东一省，一九五○年柞蚕春茧产量较一九四九年增加了四倍，秋茧增加了六倍；苏南的丝厂大部复业，并都能获得一定盈余。蚕丝出口量也在恢复。据中国蚕丝公司销货统计，去年七月份出口各种生丝数量已达四千二百公担，为国家增加了一笔不少的外汇。
    今年我国蚕丝的生产，已由维持现有水平，发展到进一步的提高。政务院在颁布关于一九五一年农林生产的决定中就明确规定：在一九五○年的基础上，今年“增产家蚕茧百分之十四·九；增产柞蚕茧百分之五十六·八”。同时在农业生产贷款中，也将蚕丝列入。从人民政府这些具体措施中，可以肯定今后我国蚕丝事业的发展有着无限光明的前途。
