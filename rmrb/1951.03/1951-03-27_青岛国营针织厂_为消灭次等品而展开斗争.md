    Qingdao State-Owned Knitting Factory
    Launches Struggle to Eliminate Substandard Products

To the Editors:

    We humbly accept the valuable criticism made by Comrade Li Baowen in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on February 24th, regarding our factory's failure to improve production conditions, which has led to a sharp increase in substandard products. We express our sincere gratitude to him. The reasons for this loss are mainly as follows: (1) The product inspection system is not sound, the standards for substandard products are not clearly defined, and the management personnel have not effectively taken on their guiding responsibilities. As a result, inspectors have developed biased thinking in distinguishing product grades, believing that "this little defect doesn't matter." We did not take appropriate warning even after the department stores returned our goods. Later, when the inspection system was improved and the standards for distinguishing products were clarified, it caused panic among the inspectors, who then developed the idea of "rather marking it as a second-class product than having it returned by the department store." This shows that we have a careless, bureaucratic work style in our leadership. (2) Planning is inadequate, and the supply of raw materials is inaccurate. For example, when the product needed colorless sulfuric acid, the factory was not prepared and had to use colored sulfuric acid as a neutralizer, which affected the color of the product. After the factory switched to 6-count yarn, we did not anticipate that the consumption of machine needles would increase. When the supply of machine needles could not keep up, we urgently borrowed them from private factories and used substandard needles from our inventory that were scheduled for disposal, resulting in an increase in substandard products. (3) We did not use our brains to find ways to overcome difficulties. Our factory has cramped buildings and simple equipment, and no good drying room. The boiler room is only 6 meters long and 2.5 meters wide, and the boiler's steam output is limited. It is already difficult to supply enough steam to heat the entire factory, let alone provide heat for drying materials. Therefore, the defective materials were dried in the yard, and coal smoke and dust adhered to the materials, resulting in contaminated substandard products. After learning the lesson of the increase in substandard products, we have installed a stove in the drying room to increase the temperature, so the defective materials no longer need to be dried in the yard, and the contaminated substandard products have been significantly reduced. (4) Management personnel have not learned to rely on the masses to manage the factory. When faced with difficulties, they cannot think of solutions themselves, so the difficulties cannot be overcome, and substandard products proliferate.

    The fundamental reason for the above shortcomings is that we have not established a sense of responsibility for the people's cause and are not good at relying on the masses. This is not only subject to criticism but also deserves punishment. The entire factory has now launched a struggle to eliminate substandard products, such as establishing systems, studying work methods, educating employees, and calling on everyone to overcome difficulties. As for other objective reasons, such as uneven yarn count, excessive twist difference, poorly manufactured machine needles, and insufficient fuel firepower, we have asked the higher authorities for help in finding solutions.

### 青岛国营针织厂  为消灭次等品而展开斗争

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    青岛国营针织厂
    为消灭次等品而展开斗争编辑同志：
    贵报二月二十四日“读者来信”栏登载李宝文同志对本厂不注意改善生产条件，以致产品的次品激增的批评。这个宝贵的意见，我们虚心接受；并恳切地向他表示感谢。造成这次损失的原因，主要是：（一）检查产品的制度不健全，次品标准定的不明确，管理人员未切实负起指导责任。因此，检查工人在区别产品等级上就产生偏差思想，认为“这一点小毛病不要紧”。当百货公司剔回我们的货以后，还没有适当地引起警惕。后来健全了检查制度，明确了产品区别标准，反而引起了检查工人的恐慌，又产生“宁打二等品也不要叫百货公司给退回来”的想法。这说明了我们领导上存在着粗枝大叶的官僚主义作风。（二）计划不周，原料供给不准确。例如：产品需要无色硫酸时，厂里还没有准备好，只得用有色硫酸作中和剂，这就影响了产品的色彩。厂里改用六支纱后，我们没有料到机针消耗量会增加，及至机针供应不上，才急向私营工厂借用，并动用库存预备报废的次针，因而造成次品增加的恶果。（三）不开动脑筋，设法克服困难。本厂房屋狭窄，设备简陋，没有好的烘干房。锅炉房仅六米长二米半宽，锅炉汽量有限，供给全厂暖汽已感勉强，再供烘坏料用，热度更是不足。于是就把坏料晒在院中，煤烟灰尘沾在料子上就造成沾污的次等品。这次接受了次等品增加的教训，在烘房已加装火炉，提高烘房的温度，坏料不必再在院中晒，沾污的次等品就显著地减少了。（四）管理人员没有学会依靠群众来管理工厂，遇到困难自己又想不出办法，以致困难不能克服，次等品激增。
    产生上述缺点的根本原因是：我们没有建立起为人民事业负责的观点，不善于依靠群众。这不但应受批评，也应该受处分。现全厂已为消灭次等品而展开了斗争。如建立制度，研究工作方法，向职工们进行教育，号召大家来克服困难等。至于其他的客观原因，如纱支条干不匀，捻度差率太大，机针制造不良，燃料火力不够等，我们已请上级帮助设法解决。
