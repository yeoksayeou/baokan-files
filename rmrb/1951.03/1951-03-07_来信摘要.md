Letter to the Editor Summary
    National Newspapers Should Strengthen Systematic Propaganda of Japanese Imperialist Crimes of Aggression Against China
    Comrade Editor:
    American imperialism is conspiring to arm the Japanese aggressors, which is resolutely opposed by every Chinese person and peace-loving people in the world. I suggest that national newspapers should represent the opinions of the people and strengthen the systematic propaganda of the Japanese imperialists' crimes of aggression against China, in order to raise the vigilance of the people of the whole country and the world, and unite to muster strength to smash the conspiracy of American imperialism to arm Japan.
    The Chinese people's hatred for the Japanese aggressors is truly endless. As far as I know, the atrocities of the Japanese bandits in Zhejiang were as cruel and inhuman as in other parts of the motherland. Fuyang County was originally a very prosperous city, but after being trampled on by the Japanese bandits, nine-tenths of it was burned down. Xiaoshan, Tonglu and other county towns were almost completely burned down. In 1942, thousands of women were raped by the Japanese bandits in Quzhou, Jiangshan and other counties during a battle, and countless fathers, elders and brothers were killed in other places. On every inch of land in the motherland, and in the hearts of every people, the towering crimes of the Japanese bandits are recorded. We should tell the people of the whole world, let the people of the whole world recognize and rise up to oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan.

            The government should stipulate the price ratio of tobacco and grain as soon as possible to dispel the ideological concerns of tobacco farmers in Henan Comrade Editor:
    In order to ensure the realization of this year's national plan to increase tobacco production, dispelling the ideological concerns of tobacco farmers is a very important issue. Henan is one of the main tobacco producing areas in China (such as Xuchang, Changge, etc.). In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' plunder and the unreasonable price ratio of purchase, the price of tobacco was not enough to cover the coal money for flue-curing tobacco, and many tobacco farmers went bankrupt as a result. Up to now, the average farmer has no confidence in growing more tobacco. They believe that growing more grain can ensure that they will not go hungry. In order to dispel the farmers' ideological concerns, I would like to make three suggestions:
    First, the government should formulate and announce a reasonable price ratio between tobacco and grain as soon as possible.
    Second, according to the needs of tobacco farmers, the government should grant loans as appropriate to solve the fertilizer problem.
    Third, the government should systematically solve the coal needed for flue-curing tobacco, in order to prevent the phenomenon of rising coal prices during the flue-curing season.
                                               Xu Yan, Peking University
    Editor's note: The State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Rural Production in 1951" on February 15, 1951, which clearly stipulated that this year's flue-cured tobacco production should be "increased by 324.8% compared with last year"; and stated that it is necessary to implement the price policy of rewarding the production of major industrial raw material crops and ensuring their purchase and marketing. This shows the People's Government's determination and full preparation for expanding tobacco production. Regarding the price ratio between tobacco and grain, the government is studying it and will be able to make a decision soon. Local government agencies, the People's Bank and cooperatives should appropriately solve the problems of loans to solve the fertilizer difficulties of tobacco farmers and ensure the price of coal.
            The active breeding season of warehouse insects is coming soon. It is recommended that warehouses in various places pay attention to prevention and control. Comrade Editor:
    The number of losses caused by insect damage in warehouses across the country due to neglecting warehouse insect prevention and control work is quite alarming. According to the situation of warehouses in various regions of northern Anhui in 1950, due to the failure to do a good job in prevention and control in advance, the phenomenon of warehouse insects was generally found when the plum rain season arrived, resulting in the shortcomings of treating insects being busier than preventing insects, and also increasing the loss of insect damage. Therefore, strengthening warehouse insect prevention and control work is completely necessary.
    The appropriate temperature for warehouse insects to reproduce is 20 to 28 degrees Celsius, and the air humidity is above 60% (equivalent to 60% of the saturated moisture in the air at the same temperature), which has little relationship with the moisture content of the grain itself. Although the moisture content of the grain itself is the main factor for grain safety, grain with moisture content within the safety standard can also produce insects. The breeding time of warehouse insects is from March to October every year, especially after the start of the plum rain season. At present, the active breeding season of warehouse insects is coming soon. In order to reduce the losses of stored grain, I suggest that grain storage cadres in various places should establish the concept of preventing more than cure, and various places should use scientific or local methods according to their own existing conditions. Preventive work should be carried out as early as possible to minimize the losses of stored grain due to insect pests.

            Use dilapidated temple materials to rebuild houses Comrade Editor:
    Comrade Peng Zhen listed the housing problem as one of the eight main tasks this year in his report at the first session of the Third People's Congress of Beijing, which made us deeply realize that only the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party is truly concerned about the lives of the people and serves the people.
    In order to solve the housing shortage in the capital, the government has decided to build 15,000 to 20,000 more houses this year, which is an enlightened measure. In order to reduce expenditures, I suggest that many dilapidated temples in various villages in the suburbs of Beijing should be demolished as materials for building houses this year. Taking the East Suburb District as an example, in addition to the larger and more complete temples taken over by the Qingguan Bureau, incomplete statistics of only 14 administrative villages such as Xiba Village still have 35 temples, totaling 439 houses. Among them, 89 have collapsed and cannot be repaired; the rest are about to collapse or urgently need to be repaired. These houses are unmanaged and uninhabited, and many bricks, tiles, and wood are eroded by wind and rain after falling to the ground. Since these dilapidated temples are neither scenic spots nor historical sites, nor have the value of repair, preservation and use, the government should use these materials to rebuild houses urgently needed by the masses.
                                     Wang Zhengmin, People's Government of the Tenth District of this city
            It is recommended that publishing departments use inferior paper to print and sell cheap books Comrade Editor:
    I am a cadre enjoying supply system treatment. Although I usually have newspapers and documents issued by higher authorities to read, I still hope to read more literary and political theory books. However, the price of books is too high. Even if we don't buy daily necessities, it is impossible to buy a thicker book with this little allowance. Therefore, I suggest whether bookstores can use some inferior paper to print and sell some cheap books, or think of some other ways to lower the price of books to meet our desire for spiritual food. This is not only my personal wish, but many comrades have such a wish, and hope that the publishing department will consider adopting it.

　　来信摘要
    全国报纸应加强日寇侵华罪行的系统宣传编辑同志：
    美国帝国主义正在阴谋武装日本侵略者，这是每一个中国人民和世界上热爱和平的人民所坚决反对的。我建议全国报纸都应代表人民的意见，加强日寇侵略中国罪行的系统宣传，以便提高全国和全世界人民的警惕，一致拿出力量来粉碎美帝武装日本的阴谋。
    中国人民对日本侵略者的仇恨真是说不完，据我所知，日寇在浙江的暴行和祖国其他地方是一样的残酷、没有人性。富阳县城本来是很繁荣的城市，经过日寇的践踏，十分之九都被烧毁，萧山、桐庐等县城几乎全被烧光了；一九四二年，衢州、江山等县在一次战役中被日寇强奸的妇女数以千计，其他地方被杀害的父老兄弟更是不计其数。在祖国每一寸土地上、每个人民心里，都记载着日寇的滔天罪行。我们应该告诉全世界人民，让全世界人民都认清并且起来反对美国帝国主义武装日本。

            政府应及早规定烟粮比价  以解除河南烟农思想顾虑编辑同志：
    为保证今年国家增产烟叶计划的实现，解除烟农的思想顾虑，是个很重要的问题。河南是我国主要烟叶产区（如许昌、长葛等县）之一。过去由于国民党反动派的掠夺和不合理比价的收购，致使烟价不够烤烟的煤钱，有不少种烟叶户因此而倾家荡产。至今一般农民对多种烟叶没有信心，他们认为，还是多种些粮食，才能保证不挨饿。为解除农民思想上的顾虑，我想提出三点建议：
    第一，政府应及早规定并公布烟粮的合理比价。
    第二，按烟农的需要，政府应酌情贷款解决肥料问题。
    第三，政府应有计划地解决烤烟所需的燃煤，方能防止烤烟季节中，煤价上涨现象。
                                               北京大学  许彦
    编者按：中央人民政府政务院在一九五一年二月十五日颁布《关于一九五一年农村生产的决定》中，明确规定今年要比去年“增产烤烟叶百分之三百二十四点八”；并说明要执行奖励主要工业原料作物生产的价格政策及保证其收购和运销。这表示了人民政府对扩大烟叶产量的决心和有充分的准备工作。关于烟粮比价问题，政府正在研究，不久即可决定；贷款解决烟农的肥料困难和保证用煤的价格问题，应由当地政府机关、人民银行和合作社予以适当解决。
            仓虫活动繁殖期即将到来  建议各地仓库注意防治工作编辑同志：
    全国各地仓库因忽视仓虫防治工作，而遭受虫蚀的损失数字是相当惊人的。根据一九五○年皖北各地区仓库情况来看，由于事先未做好防治工作，以至黄梅季节到来时，普遍发现仓虫为害现象，产生了治虫忙于防虫的缺点，也增加了虫蚀的损耗。所以加强仓虫防治工作，是完全必要的。
    仓虫适当繁殖之温度，为摄氏二十度至二十八度，空气湿度为百分之六十以上（相当于在同温度空气中饱和水份百分之六十），与粮食本身含水量关系较小。粮食本身含水量，虽为粮食安全主要因素，但水分在安全标准以内之粮食，亦能生虫。仓虫繁殖时间，为每年三月至十月，尤以黄梅季节开始后为甚。目前仓虫活动繁殖时期，即将到来，为减少储粮遭受损失起见，我建议各地粮食保管干部应树立防重于治的观点，各地应根据本身现有的条件，运用科学或土办法，即早进行预防工作，尽量减少储粮遭受虫害的损失。

            利用破旧庙宇材料改建房屋编辑同志：
    彭真同志在北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议上的报告中，把房屋问题列为今年八项主要工作之一，使我们深深体会到，只有共产党领导下的人民政府，才是真正关心人民的生活，为人民服务的。
    为了解决首都房荒现象，政府决定今年增建房屋一万五千至二万间，这是英明的措施。为了减少开支，我建议将京郊各村许多破旧庙宇，应拆掉作为本年增建房屋的材料。以东郊区来说，除清管局接管了一部较大较完善的庙宇外，仅就西坝村等十四个行政村不完全统计，仍有三十五处庙宇，计房屋四三九间。其中已倒塌八十九间，无法修理；其余有的即将倒塌，有的亟待修理。这些房屋是无人管理和居住的，好多砖、瓦、木料倒地后被风雨侵蚀。这些破旧庙宇既不是名胜古迹，又没有修理和保存使用的价值，政府应该把这些材料利用起来，改建为群众迫切需要的住房。

            建议出版部门利用较次纸张印廉价书籍出售编辑同志：
    我是受享供给制待遇的干部。平时虽然有报纸和上级发给的文件可以阅读，但是我还希望能读到更多的文艺和政治理论书籍。可是书价实在太高，我们这一点津贴即使不买日常必需用品，也不可能买到一本厚一点的书。因此我建议书店是否可以用一些比较次的纸张，印一部份廉价书发售，或者另想一些别的办法，来降低书的价格，以满足我们对精神食粮的渴望。这不仅是我个人的愿望，许多同志都有这样的愿望，希望出版部门考虑采纳。
