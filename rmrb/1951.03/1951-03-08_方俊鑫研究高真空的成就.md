　　Fang Junxin's Achievements in High Vacuum Research
　　Fang Junxin, a teaching assistant in the Physics Department of Shanghai National Jiaotong University, has highly demonstrated the spirit of active creation of people's education workers. After eight months of careful research, he reassembled a vacuum pumping machine that had been shelved for fifteen years. He also used original parts to assemble a detachable metal X-ray tube, overcoming teaching difficulties. He is now preparing to apply the vacuum system practically to the repair of sealed X-ray tubes and high-vacuum electron tubes, helping the country solve technical problems related to repair.
　　After the "February 6th" bombing of Shanghai by American-Chiang Kai-shek planes last year, the filament of the imported Coolidge-type sealed X-ray tube used in the school's atomic physics laboratory was damaged, and all X-ray experimental work was suspended. At the same time, units that generally used imported X-ray tubes and high-vacuum electron tubes also felt the pain of lacking high-vacuum equipment for repairs. After Fang Junxin heard Mayor Chen Yi's report on "overcoming difficulties and smashing the US-Chiang blockade," he considered how a scientific worker should express his patriotic enthusiasm. He thought of a vacuum pumping machine that had been purchased from abroad in 1935 in the laboratory. With the support of Zhou Tongqing, professor of atomic physics, he immediately began this arduous and meticulous work.
　　For a full eight months, he didn't even rest during holidays, entering the laboratory at 6 a.m. every morning and leaving at 10 p.m., studying diligently day and night. The pumping machine was rusty, so he carefully rubbed it with glass powder mixed with oil; the metal joints on the machine were deformed, so he patiently repaired them one by one; glass tubes needed to be made into various special shapes, so he asked Mr. Cai Zuquan of the Sino-French Pharmacy, who had excellent skills, to help blow them; when funds were insufficient, he immediately submitted a request to the East China Ministry of Education for funding; when Octoil-s was unavailable, Professor Zhou Tongqing personally went to the Chinese Academy of Sciences to find it, and always encouraged him: "Even if a scientific worker does 99 percent, it cannot be considered complete if it is one percent short."
　　With the assistance and encouragement from various parties, Assistant Fang Junxin used vacuum oils as a medium to install an oil pressure gauge. At the same time, he used the characteristics of gas in high vacuum to make an ionization pressure gauge using radio vacuum tubes; he also used original materials to install a Pirani thermal conductivity pressure gauge, completing a secondary vacuum pressure gauge that does not use mercury, which can avoid mercury vapor from being drawn in and can measure total pressure. This complete vacuum system has a dynamic vacuum system, which is used to evacuate a detachable metal X-ray tube, solving teaching difficulties; and a static vacuum system, which can repair various electron tubes and sealed X-ray tubes that require high vacuum. He also achieved rare pumping results nationwide, with a vacuum level reaching 0.0005 millimeters, while ordinary light bulbs have a vacuum of only about 0.001 millimeters.
　　In order to continue developing this research, Jiaotong University established an Electron Tube Research Working Committee by the Department of Physics and the Department of Electrical Engineering, and received encouragement and funding from the East China Ministry of Education, adding two research assistants and one technician. It is now installing a high-frequency induction heater, preparing to start repairing sealed X-ray tubes and high-vacuum electron tube work. The China Medical Company also invited the Engineering Experimental Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to jointly study with the Jiaotong University Electron Tube Research Working Committee. If the problem of glass-to-metal bonding is solved, X-ray tubes and special tubes can be manufactured independently, which will greatly help national defense science construction.

### 方俊鑫研究高真空的成就

　　方俊鑫研究高真空的成就
    上海国立交通大学物理系助教方俊鑫，高度发挥了人民教育工作者积极创造的精神，经过八个月精心钻研，把一部搁置十五年的真空抽气机重新装置起来，又以原有零件装成一具可拆金属Ｘ光管，克服了教学上的困难，现正准备把真空系统实际应用到封闭Ｘ光管和高真空电子管的修理工作上去，帮助国家解决有关修理技术的问题。
    去年“二·六”上海遭受美蒋飞机轰炸以后，该校原子物理实验室所用舶来品库力芝式封闭的Ｘ光管丝极损断，所有Ｘ射线实验部分都停顿下来，同时社会上一般采用舶来品Ｘ光管及高真空电子管的单位，也感到缺乏高度真空设备无法修理的苦恼。当方俊鑫听了陈毅市长关于“克服困难，粉碎美蒋封锁”的报告后，他就考虑一个科学工作者，应该怎样发挥自己爱国的热忱，他连想到实验室里正放着一套一九三五年从国外购置回来的真空抽气机，得到原子物理教授周同庆的赞助，立即开始这一艰巨精细的工作。
    整整八个月时间，他连假期也不休息，每天早晨六时走进实验室，晚上十时才离开，整天整晚苦心钻研。抽气机生了锈，用玻璃粉拌油细心磨擦；机上金属接头变了形，一件一件耐心修整；玻璃管需要制成各种特殊式样，请了技术很好的中法药房蔡祖泉先生帮助吹制；经费不够了，马上呈准华东教育部拨款补助；Octoil-s没有，周同庆教授亲自到中国科学院去觅取，并且时时鼓励他：“一个科学工作者，虽然做了百分之九十九，还差百分之一也不能算是完成任务。”
    方俊鑫助教就在多方面协助和慰勉下，用真空油类做媒剂，装置了油压力计，同时利用气体在高真空的特性，用无线电真空管制成了一套游离压力计；又利用原有材料装置了一套白兰尼气体导热压力计，完成了不用水银的次级真空压力计，可以避免水银蒸汽卷入，可以测量全压力。这一套完整的真空系统，一部分是动的真空系统，用以抽空一个可拆金属Ｘ光管，解决了教学上的困难；一部分是静的真空系统，可以修理各种需要高真空的电子管及封闭Ｘ光管。并且获得在全国范围内稀有的抽空成绩，真空高度达千万分之五毫米，普通电灯泡真空只有千分之一毫米左右。
    交大为了继续发展这一研究工作，由物理系和电机系成立了电子管研究工作委员会，并且得到华东教育部鼓励，拨款和增添两个研究助教和一个技术员。现在正在装置一部高周率感应电热器，准备开始修理封闭Ｘ光管和高真空电子管工作。中国医药公司并邀请中国科学院工程实验馆会同交大电子管研究工作委员会合力研究，如果玻璃和金属接焊问题获得解决，就可以自己制造Ｘ光管及特种管，对于国防科学建设将有很大的帮助。
