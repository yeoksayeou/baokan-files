Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 5th: According to TASS, the People's Council of the German Democratic Republic held a special meeting in Berlin on March 2nd. The meeting unanimously resolved to recommend that the Bonn Federal Council, together with the People's Council, submit a joint proposal to the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the issue of concluding a peace treaty. The meeting also unanimously resolved to call on the German people to support the resolutions of the World Peace Council.

The recommendation to the Bonn Federal Council states: "In view of the fact that the representatives of the four powers will hold a preparatory meeting in Paris on March 5, 1951, to formulate the agenda for the four foreign ministers' conference, the People's Council sincerely recommends to the Federal Council that 'both sides immediately submit a joint proposal to the four powers so that the issue of preparing to conclude a peace treaty with Germany in 1951 be included in the agenda of the four foreign ministers' conference. The peace treaty should be based on the following points: eradicating militarism, democratically reviving Germany, restoring Germany's unity, guaranteeing free trade and the free development of peaceful production, and withdrawing all occupying forces one year after the signing of the peace treaty.'" The resolution also urges the West German Federal Council, which has not yet responded to the appeal of the People's Council of the German Democratic Republic on January 30, to reply to this recommendation before March 4.

In the resolution endorsing the decisions of the World Peace Council, the People's Council expressed warm welcome to the resolutions of the Peace Council and expressed its willingness to do everything possible to ensure that these resolutions can be realized. The resolution expressed praise and gratitude for the importance and support given to the possibility of the German people obtaining a peace treaty and to the German people's struggle for peace discussed at the Peace Council meeting, and called on all German people to unite to prevent the peoples of all countries from the new threat to peace from German militarism, and to ensure the development of the German people in the direction of peace and democracy.

During the discussion of the draft resolution by the People's Council, the atmosphere at the meeting was very enthusiastic. The Chairman of the People's Council, Dieckmann, emphasized in his opening speech that the current moment, when the first session of the World Peace Council has made resolutions and the decision to convene the preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers is about to take place, is of great importance. Therefore, the Presidium of the People's Council decided to convene a special meeting at this time. The member of the People's Council and Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Warnke, said: "We guarantee that we will turn the peace movement throughout Germany into a powerful force to extinguish the torches in the hands of the war instigators."

　　德国人民议会建议波恩联邦议会
    向四国提出有关缔和的共同建议
    人民议会号召德国人民拥护世界和平理事会决议
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林三日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会于三月二日在柏林举行了特别会议。会议一致议决建议波恩联邦议会跟人民议会一起向苏、美、英、法四国就缔订和约问题，提出共同建议。会议也一致议决号召德国人民拥护和支持世界和平理事会决议。
    致波恩联邦议会的建议称：鉴于四强代表将于一九五一年三月五日在巴黎举行预备会议，拟订四国外长会议的议程，人民议会向联邦议会诚意地建议，“双方立即向四强提出共同建议，以便将准备于一九五一年缔订对德和约的问题列入四国外长会议的议程。和约应以下列诸点为基础：肃清军国主义、民主复兴德国、恢复德国的统一、保证自由贸易及和平生产的自由发展、以及在和约签订一年以后撤退各国占领军。”决议中并敦促迄今尚未对德意志民主共和国人民议会一月三十日的呼吁书提出答复的西德联邦议会，务必于三月四日以前，答复这个建议。
    人民议会在拥护世界和平理事会决定的决议中对于和平理事会的决议表示热烈欢迎，并表示愿尽一切力量使这些决议能够实现。决议对于和平理事会会议上讨论了德国人民获致和约的可能性及对于德国人民争取和平的斗争所给予的重视和支持，表示赞扬和感激，并号召全德人民团结起来，使各国人民得免于德国军国主义对和平的新威胁，和保证德国人民能向和平、民主的方向的发展。
    人民议会在讨论上项决议的草案时，会场情绪十分热烈。人民议会主席狄克曼在开幕辞中着重指出：目前是世界和平理事会第一届会议已作出了决议，四国外长会议预备会议即将召开的决定性时刻，这种形势是有巨大的重要性，因此人民议会主席团决定在此时召开特别会议。人民议会议员、自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克说：“我们保证将使全德国的和平运动变为一支强大的力量，来扑灭战争煽动者手里的火把。”
