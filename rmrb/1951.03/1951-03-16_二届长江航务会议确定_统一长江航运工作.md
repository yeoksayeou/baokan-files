The Yangtze River Navigation Bureau, on the basis of preliminary unification of shipping last year, convened the Second Yangtze River Navigation Conference in late January this year to further implement the policy of unifying Yangtze River shipping. The conference pointed out the achievements and shortcomings of Yangtze River shipping. In 1950, Yangtze River shipping completed the arduous task of transporting grain from Sichuan and transferring grain from Central and Southern China to East China, effectively cooperating with the central government's work of stabilizing prices, stabilizing finance, and consolidating national defense. According to statistics, last year the volume of imported and exported goods transported by various ports exceeded the original plan by 5 percent; passenger transport exceeded the original plan by 40 percent; and crew examinations were held, reducing navigation accidents. However, the shortcomings in transportation were a lack of planning, resulting in frequent mismatches; the work of reforming old enterprises and leading private shipping companies was insufficient; and navigational safety had not been securely guaranteed. Therefore, the conference determined that in 1951, transportation would be the focus, navigational safety would be guaranteed, and the policy of overall consideration of public and private interests would be correctly implemented to complete the transportation and financial tasks assigned by the state. It also focused on clarifying the steps and guidelines for unifying organizations such as navigation administration, transportation administration, port administration, and river administration. In the future, under the unified leadership of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau, administration and business will be closely integrated to implement planned transportation and develop the people's transportation industry.

　　二届长江航务会议确定
    统一长江航运工作
    长江航务局在去年初步统一航运的基础上，今年一月下旬又召开了第二届长江航务会议，进一步贯彻统一长江航运的方针。会中指出了长江航运的成绩与缺点。一九五○年长江航运完成了川粮运输及调运中南粮食去华东的艰巨任务，有力地配合了中央平抑物价、稳定金融和巩固国防等工作。据统计：去年各港进出口物资运输超过原定计划百分之五；客运超过百分之四十；并举行了船员考试，减少了航行事故。但是在运输上的缺点是缺乏计划性，以致常常配合不上；改革旧企业、领导私营轮船业的工作做得不够；航行安全还没有得到巩固的保证等等。因此，会议确定一九五一年以运输为中心，保证航行安全，正确执行公私统筹兼顾政策，以完成国家所给予的运输任务和财政任务。并着重明确了统一航务、运务、港务、江务等组织的步骤与方针。今后在长江航务局统一领导下，把行政与业务密切结合起来，实行计划运输，发展人民运输事业。
