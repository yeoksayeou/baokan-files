　　The Friendship of United Struggle Between Chinese and American Workers
     ——Letter from the American Trade Union and People's "May Day" Celebration Joint Committee and Telegram of Congratulations from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently received a letter dated March 2nd from the American Trade Union and People's "May Day" Celebration Joint Committee to Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Federation. The letter stated that they would hold a grand demonstration parade in New York on "May Day" with the central slogans of striving for peace, defending democratic rights, and economic stability. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has replied with a telegram of congratulations. The letter and reply telegram are as follows:
    Letter from the American Trade Union and People's "May Day" Celebration Joint Committee

    Dear Comrades:
    This Trade Union and People's "May Day" Celebration Joint Committee is composed of leaders from the AFL, CIO, and various independent trade unions, as well as various associations and youth, tenant, and women's organizations. The committee is preparing to hold a grand demonstration parade in New York on "May Day." This demonstration will focus on three main issues: striving for peace, democratic rights, and economic stability.
    The decisive issue for us today is the choice between peace and war. The people of the United States are becoming increasingly aware of this. The people of the United States want peace. A growing and powerful call is being heard throughout the country, demanding that American troops be withdrawn from Korea. Inspired by this spirit, a great movement to petition for peace in Washington will be held on March 14th. Peace-loving Americans will express their desire for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, friendship with the People's Republic of China, and genuine peace negotiations with the Soviet Union. A national peace conference will be held in May following the petition movement.
    Monopolist capitalists, profiting from war preparations and seeking to fatten themselves, are forcing the American working people to bear unbearable economic burdens in preparation for war and to safeguard their profits, and are constantly threatening them with the strike-breaking Taft-Hartley Act. However, laborers everywhere have demonstrated a new will to fight for maintaining a decent standard of living. Coal miners, textile workers, meatpacking workers, and others have all demonstrated this will. The great railway workers' strike has already achieved a wage increase of twelve and a half cents per hour.
    In order to suppress the people's resistance to the ruling regime's war policies, the rights of the people stipulated in the Constitution have been severely undermined. For example, the shameless Smith Act and McCarran Act are being used to massively deport foreign-born progressive workers and imprison labor leaders, writers, and others who refuse to bow before the threats of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
    Open acts of terror are even more rampant against Black people. After the "legal" execution of seven Black men in Martinsville, Virginia, peace-loving Americans are working to save the life of Willie McGee, restore the freedom of the Trenton Six, and defend the rights of the great Black leader Dr. Du Bois, who is threatened with imprisonment for his efforts to promote peace.
    Therefore, this year's "May Day" in New York will be a day of united struggle and demonstration for Black and white people to strive for peace, preserve democratic traditions, fight for Black rights, and defend the economic and political demands of American workers and all people.
    The committee will convene a preparatory conference for this demonstration on March 24th, which will be attended by one thousand delegates.
    In order to strengthen the international significance of "May Day" and express the strong desire for peace of the people of the world, we sincerely welcome you to send a telegram of congratulations to the conference. This telegram will greatly inspire the delegates attending the conference and fill them and the workers they represent with the spirit of powerful international solidarity in the worldwide struggle for peace and security.
    Awaiting your good news and extending warm fraternal greetings!

                     Executive Secretary
                                             Louis Vancesdo
                                             March 2nd
    Reply Telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Preparatory Conference for the American Trade Union and People's "May Day" Celebration
    On behalf of the Chinese working class, we extend our highest respect and warmest congratulations to your conference and the millions of American workers you represent. The American working class has already achieved victories in the struggle against American imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression and in protecting the vital interests of the American working class. We believe that you will achieve even greater success in the struggle to defend world peace.
    The Chinese working class firmly opposes the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea and firmly opposes the American imperialist plot to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm West Germany and Japan. The Chinese workers and people throughout the country have universally and deeply launched the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and are supporting the Korean people's liberation struggle with practical actions of patriotic production competitions.
    In the struggle against the conspiracies of the Wall Street warmongers, the Chinese working class will forever join hands with our American worker brothers and sisters. Let those warmongers tremble before us!
                All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                              March 23rd

　　中美工人阶级弟兄联合斗争的友情
     ——美国工会与人民庆祝“五一”节联合委员会的来信与我全国总工会的贺电
    【新华社二十六日讯】中华全国总工会最近收到美国工会与人民庆祝“五一”节联合委员会三月二日致该会副主席刘宁一的信。信中称：他们将于“五一”节在纽约举行一次以争取和平、保卫民主权利和经济安定为中心口号的盛大的示威游行。中华全国总工会已复电祝贺。来信及复电如下：
    美国工会与人民庆祝“五一”节联合委员会的来信亲爱的同志：
    本工会与人民庆祝“五一”节联合委员会是由劳联、产联和各独立工会的一些领袖，以及各联谊会及青年、房客、妇女等社团组织而成。本委员会正在筹备“五一”节在纽约举行盛大的示威游行。这次示威将以争取和平、民主权利和经济安定三个主要问题为中心口号。
    我们今天的决定性的问题，就是和、战之间的抉择问题。这一点美国全国的人民已经越来越明白了。美国的人民要的是和平。全国到处都喊出了日益有力的呼声，要求将美国军队从朝鲜撤退回国。在这种精神的感召下，三月十四日要举行一个到华盛顿去和平请愿的伟大运动。爱好和平的美国人将在这一运动中表示他们的愿望，要求和平解决朝鲜问题，与人民中国友好，并且和苏联进行真正的和平谈判。请愿运动之后，五月间将召开一个全国和平大会。
    借战争的准备以牟利自肥的垄断资本家，为了准备战争，为了保障他们的利润，迫使美国的劳动人民承受沉重不堪的经济负担，使他们经常受到破坏罢工的塔夫脱——哈特莱法案的威胁。但是各地的劳工表现了为维持一个适当的生活标准而斗争的新意志。煤矿工人、纺织工人、屠宰工人以及其他的工人都表现出这种意志。伟大的铁路工人的大罢工，已经取得每小时增加工资一角二分五的胜利。
    为了压制人民对统治政权的战争政策的反抗，宪法上所规定的人民的权利已被摧残殆尽。比如利用无耻的史密斯法和麦卡伦法，大举放逐外国出生的进步工人，并且监禁劳工领袖、作家以及其他拒绝在众院非美委员会的威胁前低头的人们。
    对于黑种人民，更是肆行公开的恐怖行为。在弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔七名黑人被“合法地”处死之后，爱好和平的美国人正在争取营救威利·麦基的性命，争取恢复特伦敦六人的自由，保卫伟大的黑人领袖——杜波依斯博士的权利，杜波依斯博士因致力于促进和平而遭受到监禁的威胁。
    因此纽约今年的“五一”节将成为黑人和白人为争取和平，争取保存民主的传统，争取黑人权利，保卫美国工人和所有人民的经济要求和政治权利而联合战斗示威的日子。
    本委员会于三月二十四日召开这次示威的筹备大会，届时将有一千名代表参加。
    为了加强“五一”节的国际意义，为了表示全世界人民强烈的和平愿望，深切欢迎你们能向大会致贺电，这贺电将大大鼓舞参加大会的代表，使他们和他们所代表的工人群众充满着有力的全世界在争取和平与安全的斗争中国际团结的精神。
    敬候佳音，并致热烈的兄弟敬礼！
                     执行秘书
                                             路易·万斯道
                                             三月二日
    中华全国总工会复电
    美国工会与人民庆祝“五一”节筹备大会
    谨代表中国的工人阶级向你们的大会及你们所代表的千百万美国工人致崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺。在反对美国帝国主义扩大侵略战争和保护美国工人阶级切身利益的斗争中，美国工人阶级已经取得了胜利。我们相信，在保卫世界和平的斗争中，你们将获得更大的成就。
    中国工人阶级坚决反对美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，并坚决反对美国帝国主义单独对日媾和以及重新武装西德和日本的阴谋。中国工人和全国人民已普遍深入地展开了抗美援朝运动，并以爱国主义生产竞赛的实际行动来支援朝鲜人民的解放斗争。
    在反对华尔街战争贩子的阴谋的斗争中，中国工人阶级永远与美国的工人兄弟姐妹们携手并进。让那些战争贩子们在我们面前发抖吧！
                中华全国总工会
                                              三月二十三日
