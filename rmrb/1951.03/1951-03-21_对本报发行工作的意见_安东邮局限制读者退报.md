Opinions on the Newspaper's Distribution Work

Andong Post Office Restricts Readers from Cancelling Subscriptions

Comrade Editor:

Our department subscribes to 31 copies of the People's Daily through the Andong Post Office. Later, our superiors supplied us with some additional newspapers, so we needed to cancel a portion of our original subscription to avoid waste. I went to the Andong Post Office on the 11th of this month to handle the cancellation. However, the comrade in charge of newspaper subscriptions at the post office said, "No, there must be formal reasons to cancel a subscription." After I explained the reason for the cancellation, that comrade still said, "No." I repeatedly asked what conditions were needed to cancel, and as a result, he put forward two conditions that were unacceptable to us. Also, regarding the *Liaodong Dazhong* newspaper we subscribe to through the same office, we live in this city, yet we only received the March 1st issue between March 1st and 4th, and it was lost twice after that. These facts prove that the post office is very irresponsible in its distribution work. We hope the responsible comrades of the post office will investigate.

Editor's Note: The Andong Post Office's restriction on readers cancelling subscriptions is unreasonable. We hope the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will investigate the distribution work of this post office, and we also hope the post office will provide a public response.

### 对本报发行工作的意见   安东邮局限制读者退报

　　对本报发行工作的意见
    安东邮局限制读者退报编辑同志：
    我部于安东邮局订有人民日报三十一份，后因上级又供应我们一部分报纸，故原订的报纸须要退订一部分，以免浪费。我即于本月十一日向安东邮局办理退订手续。但邮局管订报的同志说：“不行，退报须有正式条件。”当我说明退订原因后，那位同志仍说：“不行”。我又一再追问究竟要什么条件才能退呢？结果他提出了两个为我们所无法接受的条件。还有，我们在该局订的《辽东大众》报，我们就住在本市，三月一日至四日，才看到一日的报纸，以后又遗失了两次。从上面这些事实证明，该局对发行工作，很不负责任，希望该局负责同志检查一下。
                                        安东某部  王述凤
    编者按：安东邮局限制读者退报是不合理的，望邮电部检查该局发行工作，并望该局公开答复。
