　　All-China Esperanto Association Established
    Will Strengthen Unity and Work for Lasting World Peace and People's Democracy

    The "All-China Esperanto Association" was formally established in Beijing on the 11th. Participants in the founding meeting included the heads of the association's preparatory committee, Hu Yuzhi, Zhang Qicheng, and representatives of Esperanto workers and guests from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and other places, including Yang Hansheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, Hong Shen, Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations, and Liu Zunqi, Deputy Director of the International News Bureau of the News Administration, totaling more than one hundred people.

    The founding meeting was presided over by Hu Yuzhi, who delivered the opening remarks. He said: In its more than 60 years of development, Esperanto has become the only successfully tested international auxiliary language and a weapon for many advanced elements of all nations around the world to strengthen mutual ties and joint struggle. In the glorious list of martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution in China in the past 30 years, there are many names of Esperanto speakers. The founding of the People's Republic of China has given Chinese Esperanto speakers new and important tasks. In the future, we must strengthen unity to work to publicize our great people's motherland to the people of the world and to strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy.

    Yang Hansheng and Liu Zunqi, in their speeches, unanimously praised the achievements of Chinese Esperanto speakers in international propaganda and liaison work. Yang Hansheng said: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Esperanto played a considerable role in publicizing the War of Resistance abroad. Now, because people of all countries urgently need to understand the new China, it is necessary to strengthen our international publicity work, and Esperanto can play a certain role in this regard. Liu Zunqi said: Our country's Esperanto publication, "People's China Reports," has been welcomed by more than 30 countries around the world, and 50 percent of the text of the ten issues that have been published have been translated into the languages of various countries by Esperanto speakers and published in newspapers and magazines.

    Zhang Qicheng reported on the preparations for the association. He pointed out: The preparatory work for the establishment of a national Chinese Esperanto organization, initiated by Hu Yuzhi and others in December 1949, has received active support from Esperanto speakers all over the country for more than a year. Only with the support of the People's Government has the Chinese Esperanto movement gained conditions for free development. Progressive Esperanto speakers internationally have high hopes for the Esperanto work in the new China. This founding meeting received 158 congratulatory telegrams and letters from organizations and individuals in 22 countries.

    At the afternoon session on the 11th, the meeting unanimously adopted the "Constitution of the All-China Esperanto Association" and the declaration of the founding meeting and a letter of tribute to Chairman Mao. The meeting also agreed that the "All-China Esperanto Association" would join the international organization of progressive Esperanto speakers initiated by the Czechoslovak Esperanto Association.

    The meeting also elected 25 directors, including Hu Yuzhi, and 9 alternate directors to form the "Board of Directors of the All-China Esperanto Association." After the meeting, the Board of Directors held a meeting and elected Hu Yuzhi as Chairman.

　　全国世界语协会成立
    将加强团结为争取世界持久和平与人民民主而工作
    “中华全国世界语协会”十一日在京正式成立。参加成立大会的有该会筹备会的负责人胡愈之、张企程等与北京、天津、上海、重庆等地世界语工作者的代表及来宾中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副秘书长阳翰笙、对外文化联络事务局局长洪深、新闻总署国际新闻局副局长刘尊棋等一百多人。
    成立大会由胡愈之主持并致开会词。他说：世界语在其发展的六十多年来，已成为唯一试验成功的国际补助语，成为全世界各民族的许多先进分子加强互相间的联系和共同斗争的武器。中国在三十年来为革命牺牲的先烈的光荣名录中，有不少世界语者的名字。中华人民共和国的成立赋予中国世界语者以新的重大的任务。今后，我们要加强团结为向全世界人民宣扬我们的伟大人民祖国而工作，为争取世界持久和平与人民民主而工作。
    阳翰笙、刘尊棋在致词中一致赞扬了中国世界语者在国际宣传联络工作方面的成就。阳翰笙说：在抗战时期，世界语在向国外宣传抗战上曾起过相当大的作用。现在，由于各国人民都迫切需要了解新中国，我们的国际宣传工作有加强的必要，而世界语在这方面是可以发挥它的一定的作用的。刘尊棋说：我国的世界语刊物《人民中国报道》已经受到世界上三十几个国家的欢迎，已经出版的十期中有百分之五十的文字被各国世界语者译成各该国文字，在报纸、杂志上发表。
    张企程报告了该会的筹备经过。他指出：成立中国世界语全国组织的筹备工作，自一九四九年十二月由胡愈之等发起后，一年多来得到全国各地世界语者的积极赞助。只有在人民政府的支持下，中国世界语运动才得到了自由发展的条件。国际间的进步世界语者对新中国的世界语工作寄予了热情的期望。这次成立会，曾收到二十二个国家的团体和个人的一百五十八件贺电和贺信。
    大会在十一日下午一致通过《中华全国世界语协会会章》及成立大会的宣言和向毛主席致敬信。大会并同意“中华全国世界语协会”参加捷克斯洛伐克世界语协会所发起的进步世界语者的国际组织。
    大会并选出胡愈之等理事二十五人，候补理事九人，组成“中华全国世界语协会理事会”。大会后，理事会即举行会议，互选出胡愈之为理事长。
