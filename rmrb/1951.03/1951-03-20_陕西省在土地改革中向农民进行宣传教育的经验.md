　　Shaanxi Province's Experience in Conducting Propaganda and Education for Peasants During Land Reform
       Li Ming
    To make land reform a conscious and voluntary movement of the broad masses of peasants, it is necessary to continuously carry out propaganda and education work for peasants in the land reform movement to enhance the peasants' class consciousness and revolutionary confidence. Some areas in Shaanxi Province have gained the following experiences in this regard:
    (1) Use the method of "speaking bitterness" to enlighten the peasants' class consciousness and make them understand the significance of land reform. Landless and land-poor peasants often willingly want to divide the land, but because they have been deeply deceived and educated by the feudal ruling class, some of them have backward ideas such as "poverty and wealth are determined by fate, and land division will not last long" and "if you are not blessed, dividing property will bring disaster," or they have the idea of "waiting for cadres to distribute the land." How can we make these peasants aware? The Fourth Township of Guozhen District in Baoji County, Shaanxi Province, did this: they encouraged peasants to speak bitterness, so that peasants could understand the crimes of landlords exploiting peasants from their own personal experiences. At the township peasant representative meeting, a representative from the fifth administrative village said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the landlord Dong Qi-wu was the baozhang, and he conscripted me four times in a row, forcing me to sell my house and land. This is the root cause of my poverty." After a representative from the fourth administrative village spoke of his bitterness, he said: "Now is the time for us poor people to turn over. Let's work together to participate in the peasant association and make land reform!" The local work team used the many facts spoken out by the peasants to further explain the significance and purpose of the land reform policy, and the peasants stood up to make land reform with justified confidence. However, some cadres did not know how to do this, but lectured according to the books, or gave big reports to the peasants, who listened without feeling anything, and some said: "The words are all good, but I can't remember them." It even caused some misunderstandings.
    (2) Propaganda must be combined with solving practical problems. The work team of the first administrative village of the eighth township of the sixth district of Lintong publicized the land reform policy for three days, but the peasants were still indifferent and didn't care about land reform. After the work team conducted in-depth investigation and research, they learned that everyone did not dare to fight against the landlord Li Yunzhang because the village director Li Pengzhang shielded him. Therefore, the work team mobilized everyone to expose Li Pengzhang's mistakes, removed Li Pengzhang from his position as director, and expelled him from the peasant association. From then on, everyone became active in the land reform work. Several township peasants in Weinan County first demanded that the landlords' destructive activities be stopped. At this time, the work team mobilized the peasants to fight against five illegal landlords and sent four of them with heinous crimes to the people's court for punishment. In this way, the peasants' movement to speak bitterness was launched. From the bitterness speaking, they realized that their past poverty was caused by the landlords' cruel exploitation, and their class consciousness was greatly improved. At the same time, the work team used the experience of the peasants uniting to defeat the landlords this time to explain the significance of organizing peasant associations, and the peasants joined the peasant association and the Communist Youth League one after another. The land reform movement in these townships was rapidly launched. On the contrary, when the work team of the sixth township of the sixth district of Lintong first went there, the masses welcomed them with gongs and drums, and enthusiastically studied the land reform policy, but the work team only explained the policy verbally and did not take action to solve the problems that the masses urgently needed to solve, so the enthusiasm of the masses gradually declined.
    (3) Unite the activists among the masses and conduct propaganda to the masses together. After the Fourth Township of Guozhen District, Baoji County held a peasant representative meeting, a representative from the first administrative village explained the benefits of land reform to everyone at the night school, and exposed the landlords' rumors and deceptions, and led the peasants to discuss the organizational rules of the peasant association. Everyone's awareness was raised, and they said: "The landlords spread rumors to deceive us, and still want to ride on our heads. We must twist into one force to defeat the landlords!" At that time, the peasants reported joining the peasant association, and organized militia to patrol and monitor the landlords. In Yubaotun, Lintong 7th District, 10th Township, village cadres and peasants automatically gathered to study the land reform policy every night. The work team explained the land reform policy and news in the newspapers to them, and inspired everyone to discuss. As a result, the poor peasant Ma Qunling was able to express his opinion on class delineation: "Wang Shengxiang's past designation as a rich peasant is wrong. His family has labor force but does not participate in labor. Before liberation, he hired two or three long-term workers every year, and also hired short-term workers. He also lent dozens of stones of wheat, all relying on exploiting others for a living. He is a landlord." When the work team cadres wrote an example of a rich peasant component on the blackboard, many people argued with each other. However, some places have not paid attention to this work, so the propaganda effect is not great.

　　陕西省在土地改革中向农民进行宣传教育的经验
       立明
    要使土地改革成为广大农民自觉自愿的运动，必须在土地改革运动中，不断地向农民进行宣传教育工作，提高农民的阶级觉悟和革命信心。陕西省有些地方已在这方面取得以下几点经验：
    （一）用诉苦的方法，来启发农民的阶级觉悟，使其了解土地改革的意义。无地少地的农民常常是心里愿意分地，但因为受封建统治阶级的欺骗教育过深，有一部分人有“穷富由天定，分地理不长”和“命里没福气，分下财物遭祸事”的落后思想，或者有“等待干部给分地”的想法。我们怎样使这些农民觉悟起来呢？陕西省宝鸡县虢镇区第四乡是这样做的：他们启发农民诉苦，使农民从自己亲身的遭遇中认识了地主剥削农民的罪恶。在乡农民代表会上，五行政村一个代表说：“国民党反动统治时代，地主董其五当保长，连着给我派了四回壮丁，逼的我把房子、地都卖完了，这就是我穷的根子。”四行政村一个代表诉了苦以后说：“现在是咱穷人翻身的时候了，大家一条心，参加农会闹土地改革！”当地工作组即以农民诉出的很多事实，进一步去说明土地改革政策的意义和目的，农民便理直气壮地起来闹土地改革了。但是另有些干部却不会这样做，而是照着书本讲，或者给农民作大报告，农民听了不痛不痒，有的说：“话都是好话，就是记不下。”甚至还引起一些误解。
    （二）要与解决实际问题结合起来进行宣传。临潼六区八乡一行政村工作组宣传了三天土地改革政策，但农民对土地改革还是冷冷淡淡漠不关心。工作组深入调查研究之后，才知道大家因为村主任李鹏章包庇了地主李云章，所以不敢起来斗争地主。于是工作组就发动大家揭发李鹏章的错误，并撤消了李鹏章的主任职务，把他开除出农会。从这以后大家对土地改革工作便积极起来了。渭南县有几个乡的农民，首先要求制止地主的破坏活动。这时工作组便发动农民向五个不法地主进行了斗争，并将其中四个罪大恶极的送交人民法庭惩办。这样农民的诉苦运动就展开了，从诉苦中认识了自己过去的穷苦是由于地主残酷剥削造成的，他们的阶级觉悟就大大提高。同时工作组又用这次农民团结起来斗倒地主的经验，说明了组织农会的意义，农民就纷纷地参加了农会和青年团。这几个乡的土地改革运动便迅速展开了。相反的，临潼六区六乡工作组刚去时，群众曾打着锣鼓欢迎，并热烈学习土地改革政策，但工作组只是口头上讲解政策，不动手去解决群众迫切需要解决的问题，因而群众情绪就逐渐低落了。
    （三）要团结群众中的积极分子，共同向群众进行宣传。宝鸡县虢镇区四乡在开过农民代表会后，一行政村代表在夜校讲解了土地改革对大家的好处，和揭破了地主的造谣欺骗，并领导农民讨论了农民协会组织通则。大家觉悟提高了，他们说：“地主造谣骗咱们，还想骑在咱们头上，咱们要扭成一股劲斗倒地主！”当时农民纷纷报告参加农会，组织民兵放哨监视地主。临潼七区十乡御宝屯乡村干部、农民，每到天一黑，就自动集合起来学习土地改革政策，工作组就给他们讲解土地改革政策和报纸上的消息，并启发大家讨论。贫农马群令因此就能在划阶级中提出自己的意见：“王生相过去被订成的富农成份，不对，他家有劳动力不参加劳动，解放前每年雇两三个长工，兼雇短工，还放几十石麦的账，全靠剥削别人生活，他是个地主。”当工作组干部把一个富农成份的例子写在黑板上时，就有许多人互相争论。但有些地方还未重视这一工作，因而宣传效果不大。
