　　Hunan No. 1 Textile Factory Ignores Newspaper Criticism
    Continues to Illegally Sell Gauze

Editor:

    On February 9th, the People's Daily "Reader Letters" column criticized the Hunan No. 1 Textile Factory (i.e., Anjiang Yarn Factory) for not complying with the State Council Financial and Economic Committee's decision on the unified purchase of cotton yarn. However, this has not yet attracted the attention of the factory's leadership. In mid-February, the factory again sold 3,100 bolts of grey cloth to the Hunan Provincial People's Government Finance Department at a unit price of 275,000 yuan per bolt (the Finance Department's acceptance of cotton cloth from the yarn factory is also illegal – Editor). Article 1 of the decision on the unified purchase of cotton yarn clearly stipulates: "...All cotton yarn spun by public and private yarn factories and cotton cloth woven by themselves shall be purchased uniformly by the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation..." However, the factory has repeatedly sold yarn and cloth privately, which is an illegal act. As far as we know, the factory is also competing to purchase cotton in Donggang, Public Security County, which borders Hunan and Hubei, and in the Banzhudang area of Hubei, which also hinders the state's management of the cotton market. We are making this criticism again, hoping that the factory will quickly correct these illegal acts, and we hope that the local industrial and commercial departments will earnestly implement the decision on the unified purchase of cotton yarn.

    Editor's Note: The Hunan No. 1 Textile Factory's failure to comply with the State Council Financial and Economic Committee's decision on the unified purchase of cotton yarn and its refusal to accept newspaper criticism is wrong. It is hoped that the relevant leading organs will urge it to conduct a thorough inspection and immediately correct the situation. Reader Jin Wu's report of the factory's illegal acts demonstrates a spirit of upholding state laws.

### 湖南第一纺织厂不接受报纸批评  继续违法私售纱布

　　湖南第一纺织厂不接受报纸批评
    继续违法私售纱布编辑同志：
    二月九日，人民日报《读者来信》栏批评了湖南第一纺织厂（即安江纱厂）不遵守政务院财政经济委员会关于统购棉纱的决定后，但至今仍未引起该厂领导方面的注意。二月中旬，该厂又售给湖南省人民政府财政厅灰细布三、一○○匹，每匹单价二七万五千元（该厅接受纱厂棉布亦属违法——编者）。关于统购棉纱的决定第一条即明文规定：“……凡公私纱厂自纺部分的棉纱及自织的棉布，均由国营花纱布公司统购。……”，而该厂竟数次私行出售纱布，这是违法的行为。据我们所知，该厂并在湖南、湖北交界的公安县东港及湖北班竹壋一带竞购棉花，也妨碍了国家对棉花市场的管理。我们特再提出批评，希望该厂迅速纠正这些违法行为，并望当地工商部门认真执行关于统购棉纱的决定。
                                                读者  靳吾
    编者按：湖南第一纺织厂不遵守政务院财政经济委员会关于统购棉纱的决定，不接受报纸的批评，是不对的。希有关领导机关督促其深入检查并立即纠正。读者靳吾检举该厂的不法行为，表现了维护国家法令的精神。
