Comrade Mao Zedong Developed the Theory of Truth

(I) The Question of Truth is an Important Question Concerning the Success or Failure of the Revolution

Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" repeatedly discusses the question of truth. Based on the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, he correctly points out the nature of truth, determines the criteria for truth, and how to solve the problem of whether theoretical things conform to objective truth. He "profoundly explained and developed the famous Engels and Lenin's principles on absolute truth and relative truth, and on the consistency of objective things and subjective things" (Truth Daily Editorial Department). It is not difficult to see that Comrade Mao Zedong regards these doctrines of truth as a very important part of the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and exerts great effort to develop them. The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong attaches such importance to the question of truth in theory is, in the final analysis, due to the fact that in the long historical practice of the Chinese revolution, it has always been an extremely important issue concerning success or failure, and also a difficult issue that needs to be resolved with arduous efforts.

In the article "Reform Our Study" in 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong made a simple summary of the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle in modern times: "For the past hundred years, the disaster-ridden Chinese nation has seen its outstanding figures struggling and sacrificing themselves, advancing wave upon wave, exploring the truth of saving the nation and the people, which is truly admirable and inspiring. However, it was not until after the First World War and the Russian October Revolution that we found Marxism-Leninism, the best truth, as the best weapon for liberating our nation." From the failure of the Opium War to the period of the First World War and the Russian October Revolution, the Chinese people went through about eighty years of struggle, and because they did not find the best truth, the revolutionary movement never achieved victory. It has only been twenty-eight years since the Chinese people found Marxism-Leninism, the best truth, and the Chinese Communist Party was founded. Comrade Mao Zedong announced in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that the Chinese people's own revolutionary struggle had achieved basic victory. In terms of the twenty-eight-year history of the Chinese Communist Party, whether the revolutionary leadership can grasp the truth of Marxism-Leninism is also closely related to the success or failure of the revolution. In some periods, especially during the Great Revolution of 1927 and the domestic war period from 1931 to 1934, because some revolutionary leaders did not understand what the real truth of Marxism-Leninism was, and because they mistook errors—right-leaning opportunism and "left"-leaning adventurism in the political line, and dogmatism and empiricism in ideological methods—as truth, the revolution and the people suffered great losses. If some revolutionary leaders represented by Comrade Mao Zedong had not adhered to the truth of Marxism-Leninism and waged continuous and resolute struggles against these erroneous tendencies, then the victory of the Chinese people today would be unimaginable.

In 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his report "On Coalition Government" at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Communists must be ready at all times to uphold the truth, because any truth is in the interest of the people. Communists must be ready at all times to correct their mistakes, because any mistake is not in the interest of the people." How important the understanding of truth is to the revolution and the people, there are still many of our working cadres who cannot deeply understand, or even completely fail to understand. Some people are unwilling to learn the truth of Marxism with a spirit of hard work, on the pretext that it seems that they can still work without studying theory, but they do not know that without studying theory, they can never do a good job of leading work, and they can never avoid or reduce mistakes in leading work. Some people cannot actively uphold the truth in work and study, adopt an indifferent attitude towards the division between truth and error, and cannot bravely expose errors and fight against them. All these situations of lacking an active and serious attitude towards truth are not in the interests of the revolution and the people, and are contrary to Comrade Mao Zedong's spirit of attaching importance to theoretical study and truth.

To be good at upholding the truth, one must understand what truth is, learn to distinguish between truth and error, and understand how to keep our understanding constantly objective and truthful. To solve these problems, we must seriously study the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of truth developed and elaborated in "On Practice" and apply it to our work and study.

(II) The Principle of Practice as the Criterion of Truth

What is truth? Truth is the correct understanding that conforms to the laws of objective things. If a person's thinking does not conform to the laws of objective things, then it is not a true understanding, but an erroneous understanding. How to distinguish between truth and error? How to prove whether our thoughts and understanding conform to the laws of objective things? Comrade Mao Zedong gave a clear answer according to the principles of Marxism: "Through practice." "The actual situation is that only when people achieve the results they expected in the process of social practice (the process of material production, the process of class struggle, the process of scientific experimentation), is people's understanding verified. If people want to obtain the victory of work, that is, to obtain the expected results, they must make their own thoughts conform to the laws of the objective world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice. After failure, people will also learn lessons from failure and correct their own thoughts to make them suitable for the laws of the outside world. People can turn failure into victory. The so-called 'failure is the mother of success' and 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit' is the reason for this." Therefore, "Judging whether a perception or theory is true is not determined by how one subjectively feels, but by the results of objective social practice. The criterion of truth can only be social practice. The point of view of practice is the first and basic point of view of the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge."

Marx said in "Theses on Feuerbach": "The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory, but is a practical question. Man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question." The basic principles stipulated by Marx here are explained in more detail in the works of Engels and Lenin ("Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," "Anti-Dühring," "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," etc.), and they are further specifically developed in Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice."

Denying practice as the criterion of truth has been a trick used by many reactionary philosophers to lead people into the quagmire of idealism and agnosticism. Lenin gave a profound exposure to this trick in his "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." The fundamental reason why many school teachers and intellectuals in the old society were easily addicted to the empty talk of scholastic philosophy was precisely because they were poisoned by this kind of idealism. Ignoring the principle of practice as the criterion of truth, or being completely ignorant of this principle, has caused many people to make subjective mistakes in revolutionary work. They close their eyes and refuse to conduct any investigation and research on the practical experience of the masses, and regard hearsay and their own subjective "assumptions" as the truth, and use them to arbitrarily decide policies and guide work. Anything that does not conform to or does not fully conform to their "assumptions," even if it is a successful experience proved in the practice of the masses, will be labeled with the hat of opportunism and given ruthless blows. All actions under the guidance of their "assumptions," even if they fail and are battered and bloodied in the practice of the masses, they will still find reasons to render it as a great victory, and continue to hit the wall of failure, and they will never admit failure, let alone "learn lessons from failure and correct their own thoughts to make them suitable for the laws of the outside world." The revolutionary people of China have suffered great losses because of these subjective leaders. Among today's working cadres, there are still some such subjective tendencies. Although they do not occupy such important leading positions, if they do not pay attention to overcoming their own subjectivism, they will still cause considerable losses to the work and the people in certain places.

Upholding the principle of practice as the criterion of truth and carrying out an irreconcilable struggle with such idealists and subjectivists, and making them abandon the attitude of "self-proclaimed 'number one in the world'" and "hypocrisy and arrogance," and honestly learn from the revolutionary practice of the people, is very necessary for the revolution and the people. In this regard, Comrade Mao Zedong himself set an outstanding example. He not only elaborated the principle of practice as the criterion of truth in theory, but more importantly, in action, in the guidance of all practical revolutionary struggles, he always adhered to this principle. Contrary to those subjectivists who closed their eyes and did not look at social practice, Comrade Mao Zedong never forgot to combine the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution at any time, conduct investigation and research from the practical struggle of the broad masses of the people, and draw out ideas, theories, plans, and programs that conform to the laws of objective things, to oppose the erroneous ideas, theories, plans, and programs of subjectivism, and to provide correct guidance for work. To understand how Comrade Mao Zedong adhered to these principles, just recall how he came to the conclusion in 1927 from the investigation of the Hunan peasant movement that was opposed to Chen Duxiu's right-leaning capitulationism, or recall how he put forward the correct line to guide the revolution from 1931 to 1935 based on the concrete practical experience of the revolutionary struggle at that time, to oppose the "left"-leaning adventurist line of the dogmatists, just recalling these examples is enough.

It must be noted here that in the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, the practice that is regarded as the basis of the development of knowledge and the criterion of truth is fundamentally different from the "practice" sometimes discussed in old philosophy and understood in the minds of ordinary people influenced by old philosophy. It is necessary to clearly distinguish them. When the idealism of old philosophy refers to the question of knowing and doing, theory and practice, the "doing" or practice it understands is abstract, superficial, one-sided, and even mysterious and reactionary. The content it refers to is either merely the self-cultivation behavior of Confucianism, or the so-called practice of certain ethical principles, or Hegel's "transformation of the direct through contemplation," or vulgar human relations, or the adventurous behavior of individual heroism, or some inner experience that is nonsense in some decadent and reactionary philosophies. These concepts of "practice" and "doing" stipulated by idealist philosophy are fundamentally different from the scientific concept of practice in dialectical materialism, or Marx's "real sensory activity" of mankind. The American reactionary bourgeois philosophy—experimentalism—that Hu Shi peddled to China in the May Fourth Movement, its so-called "practical effect test" is also an idealist concept disguised with scientific terms. It is impossible to correctly solve the relationship between practice and knowledge based on these erroneous concepts. Old materialism also cannot understand what true practical action is, such as Feuerbach, who regards practice as a low-level physiological and sensual activity, "understands and determines practice only in its dirty Jewish form" (Theses on Feuerbach), and regards "the point of view of practice, the point of view of diet" (Feuerbach) as one thing. "He does not understand the meaning of 'revolutionary', 'practical-critical' activity" (Marx). Since old materialism understands practice from such a low-level meaning, it is impossible to place practice in a superior position as the criterion of truth in epistemology.

To study "On Practice," one must strictly distinguish between the scientific concept of practice in Marxism and those shallow, chaotic, vulgar, and even mysterious and reactionary concepts in old philosophy. Otherwise, it is absolutely impossible to correctly understand Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and the doctrine of truth it contains.

Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" systematically and thoroughly elaborated the specific content of the dialectical materialist concept of practice. According to the meaning of precise regulations, he sometimes specifically called it "social practice" or "practice of transforming reality," which is different from the vaguely defined concept in old philosophy and in the minds of ordinary people, and different from the "practical effect" required by the imperialist reactionaries who oppose the transformation of reality. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Only people's social practice is the criterion of the truth of people's understanding of the outside world." The specific content of social practice, the most important, is the practice of production activities and the practice of class struggle in various forms of class society. Among them, the practice of production activities is "the most basic practical activity" and "the basic source of the development of human knowledge," and at the same time, various forms of class struggle "give a profound influence to the development of human knowledge. In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with the mark of class."

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the degree of human understanding of truth develops with the development of social practice, first of all with the development of production activities. "The production activities of human society are developing step by step from low-level to high-level. Therefore, people's knowledge, whether in terms of the natural world or in terms of society, is also developing step by step from low-level to high-level, that is, from shallow to deep, from one-sided to more aspects." At the same time, in class society, the development of class struggle is also a decisive condition for the development of human knowledge. In the past for a long period of time, due to the small scale of production, due to the prejudice of the exploiting classes often distorting the history of society and limiting the people's vision, especially the reactionary exploiting classes that opposed social changes in various eras wanted to cover up the truth of historical development. These conditions made the human understanding of society and history lack a comprehensive scientific truth for a long time, and could only be limited to a one-sided understanding. However, every progressive class struggle in history that transformed the real society always made people's understanding of the truth move forward. When the proletariat appeared with the large industry accompanied by huge productivity, people were finally able to make a comprehensive historical understanding of the development of social history, and thus the scientific truth of Marxism appeared.

Therefore, only "social practice," "the practice of transforming reality"—the practice of production activities that transform the natural world and the practice of class struggle that transforms society, is the real foundation of the development of human knowledge. Anyone who hopes to continuously approach the objective truth of his understanding of the outside world can only participate in the practice of transforming reality. People who study natural science must let their laboratory research and the reasoning and calculation in their minds maintain some kind of appropriate, direct or indirect connection with the social production activities of industry and agriculture, so that they can continuously obtain new inspiration and continuous progress in invention and discovery. Natural science researchers who are completely separated from production activities, even if they can obtain some ready-made knowledge, it is difficult to continuously approach new truths beyond the level of ready-made knowledge. The general stagnation or slow progress of the natural science community in old China can basically be explained by the isolation of natural science research and production activities under the reactionary rule. People who study social history, or people who hope to gain a correct understanding of social, historical and revolutionary issues, must combine their research with the class struggle that transforms the real society, and must participate in the class struggle that transforms the real society rather than preserves the old society, in order to truly understand the truth of social science. People who are divorced from progressive class struggle, as of today, those who are divorced from the class struggle of the people of all countries in the world against all reactionary forces headed by US and British imperialism, those who pride themselves on being aloof from politics, those who are satisfied with the so-called self-cultivation and practice of a few upper-class figures, those who are nostalgic for the old society and even stand on the reactionary position of preserving the old society, it is impossible to correctly understand the truth of social historical development and revolutionary development.

(III) The Dialectical Road to Approaching Objective Truth

How do people make their subjective knowledge approach objective truth in practice? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that this is an active development process that follows the laws of dialectics. People's approach to objective truth in practice can only reach the "stage of perceptual knowledge," "the stage of sensation and impression" at first. The preliminary experience we obtain in our work belongs to the knowledge of this stage. In this stage, people's understanding is relatively low-level, that is, they can only recognize the "phenomena of things, the various aspects of things, and the external connections of these things." Only after "the continuation of social practice, making the things that cause sensation and impression in practice repeated many times, then a sudden change in the process of knowledge arises in people's minds, and concepts are produced." At this time, people's understanding "is no longer the phenomena of things, not the various aspects of things, not their external connections, but has grasped the essence of things, the whole of things, and the internal connections of things." This is reaching the "stage of rational knowledge." Rational knowledge "is a more important stage in the entire process of people's understanding of a thing," because only rational knowledge can enable people to "understand the internal contradictions of objective things, understand its laws, and understand the internal connections between this process and that process." After we have worked for a period of time, we must make a summary of the experience of various aspects of work, which is in order to make our understanding reach the rational stage. However, merely reaching the stage of rational knowledge cannot completely solve the problem of whether our thinking conforms to objective truth. "To completely solve this problem, we can only return the rational knowledge to social practice, apply theory to practice, and see if it can achieve the expected purpose." If the expected purpose can be achieved, it proves that the rational knowledge has conformed to objective truth. If the expected purpose cannot be achieved, or cannot be fully achieved, it proves that it does not conform or does not fully conform to objective truth, and it must be revised in whole or in part. This is the "process of testing theory and developing theory in practice, which is the continuation of the entire process of knowledge," and it is the "more important" stage of knowledge. When we summarize the experience in our work into new guidelines and plans, and then use them to guide the work, we are making our knowledge enter this "more important" stage. In this stage, of course, we still cannot regard the established guidelines and plans as absolutely unchangeable, and we often have to make necessary revisions based on the results produced in the work. "The active role of knowledge is not only manifested in the active leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, but more importantly, it must be manifested in this leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice." Because only through this "leap" can the problem of whether our understanding of the outside world conforms to objective truth be completely solved.

Lenin wrote in "Conspectus of Hegel's Book 'The Science of Logic'": "From living perception to abstract thought, and from this to practice, -- such is the dialectical path of the cognition of truth, of the cognition of objective reality." Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" elaborates in detail on this "dialectical path" of the cognition of truth pointed out by Lenin. This is an important development of the theory of truth and of the principle of practice as the criterion of truth given by Comrade Mao Zedong. These developments of Comrade Mao Zedong are closely combined with the struggle against various erroneous ideas in the history of the Chinese revolution. He summarized the experience of these struggles and revealed from the basis of epistemology the reasons why the two basic erroneous tendencies of dogmatism and empiricism went astray. The cognition of truth must be obtained through a regular process of effort in practice. If one does not understand these inevitable laws and processes, does not admit that the cognition of truth must adopt an honest and scientific attitude in accordance with these laws and processes, and thinks that one can adopt any easy and clever attitude, thinking that one can suddenly obtain it only by a sudden glance or a flash of inspiration, without preparing to pay considerable effort and painstaking efforts, this ignorant and fluke attitude, this opportunistic attitude in ideological methods, is the root cause of the occurrence of various erroneous cognitions. The reason why dogmatism deviates from objective truth is because it deviates from practice; because it deviates from perceptual knowledge based on practice; because it does not understand the "materialist principle of epistemology" that "knowledge begins with experience"; because it does not understand the truth that theory is summarized from many experiences; because it does not understand that it is necessary to "transform and process the rich sensory materials by discarding the crude and selecting the fine, discarding the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the outside to the inside, to create a system of concepts and theories" in order to "leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge"; because it does not understand that in order to obtain rich sensory materials, it is necessary to conduct thorough investigation and research on the object to be understood and its surrounding environment, to contact the masses, to learn from the masses, and to obtain a large amount of indirect experience from the practical experience of the production activities and class struggle of the broad masses to supplement the lack of personal practical experience. Only in this way is it possible to make a comprehensive summary of experience. In short, dogmatists do not understand that perceptual knowledge is a necessary stage to approach objective truth, so they do not know that they should extract vivid theories that reflect objective reality from practical experience, and regard the "hearsay of superficial understanding" or the ready-made clauses copied from books as formulas and apply them randomly everywhere. In this way, they leave the road to approaching objective truth and embark on the empty road of subjectivism.

Empiricists, on the other hand, blocked the road for people to approach objective truth, which is not understanding the "dialectical principle of epistemology" that "the perceptual stage of knowledge needs to be developed to the rational stage." They are self-satisfied with the little direct practical experience they have, complacent about their small achievements and narrow views, despise indirect experience in all aspects, and will not systematically and organizationally engage in thorough investigation and research and learn from experience in all aspects. They do not know the necessity of transforming and improving the rich sensory materials to make them become the necessity of rational knowledge, and do not understand the necessity of summarizing experience. They regard summarizing experience as an unbearable bitter thing, mistakenly regard reading books and learning theory as a superfluous act, and regard learning new knowledge and applying their minds to think about problems as unnecessary trouble. Therefore, the knowledge of empiricists is stagnant in the narrow and low-level perceptual stage, it is impossible to understand the whole of things, the essence of things and the internal laws of things, it is impossible to "have an overall view of the objective process" in practice, grasp clear guidelines, see the great future, and is in a blind state regarding the objective truth of the development of things.

In this way, dogmatism and empiricism leave the dialectical path of knowing the truth in two different directions. Comrade Mao Zedong developed the Marxist theory of truth and pointed out in detail this correct path, which points out to us the clear direction to avoid repeating these historical mistakes.

(IV) The Relative and Absolute Nature of Truth

Comrade Mao Zedong strictly followed the principles of dialectical materialism and pointed out that the process of knowing the truth is by no means completed once and for all, but is a process of constantly moving forward and developing. This is because the cognition of truth can only be a correct reflection of the process of objective things, and the process of objective things, "whether belonging to the natural world or to the social world, due to internal contradictions and struggles, are moving forward and developing forward, and people's cognitive movement should also follow its movement and development." Therefore, after people have obtained a correct understanding of a certain process and a certain stage of development of objective things, even if it has been tested in practice and proved to be a truth that fully conforms to objective laws, it still cannot be regarded as an unconditional absolute truth. Once new shifts and changes occur in the process of objective things, one must make one's own subjective knowledge follow its shifts and changes to make it conform to the laws of the new objective process. Therefore, if people want to keep their knowledge constantly objective and truthful, they must never stop their efforts to learn at any time, and they must constantly follow the development of practice and advance, so that their knowledge of objective things can also develop and advance. "Marxism-Leninism has not ended the truth, but is constantly opening up the road to knowing the truth in practice."

Comrade Mao Zedong especially used the experience of revolutionary historical practice to prove the necessity of the continuous development of the cognition of truth. He said: "In terms of social movements, the true revolutionary leaders not only must be good at correcting their own thoughts, theories, plans, and programs when they are wrong, ... but also must be good at making themselves and all the people participating in the revolution follow the shifts and changes in subjective cognition when a certain objective process has shifted and changed from a certain stage of development to another stage of development, that is, to make the proposal of new revolutionary tasks and new work programs suitable for the changes in the new situation. The changes in the situation in the revolutionary period are very rapid. If the cognition of the revolutionaries cannot change rapidly with it, they cannot guide the revolution to victory."

These summaries of revolutionary historical experience by Comrade Mao Zedong specifically elaborate and develop the principle pointed out by Engels in "Anti-Dühring": "Truth and error, like all logical categories moving in polar opposites, only have absolute validity within extremely limited domains." That is to say, people's subjective knowledge can only maintain its objective truth if it is proven in practice to constantly conform to the objective situation, and only if it can constantly develop with the development of practice and shift with the shifts and changes in the objective situation. This is called "the concrete historical unity of subject and object, theory and practice, knowledge and action." If people's knowledge stagnates and does not move, is satisfied with existing knowledge, and turns the correct understanding of a certain process and a certain stage into a rigid prejudice, and cannot develop and change with the development and change of social practice and objective processes, then the correct understanding that originally suited the objective situation will become a subjective fantasy that is divorced from reality, and truth will become error. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that this error caused by the split between subject and object and the split between theory and practice is the epistemological root cause of the right-leaning opportunism and "left"-leaning adventurism that occurred in revolutionary practice. Right-leaning opportunists are "die-hards in the revolutionary ranks," who "cannot see that the struggle of contradictions has pushed the objective process forward, and their cognition still stops at the old stage." "Their thoughts are separated from social practice, they cannot stand at the head of the social wheel and act as guides, they only know how to follow behind the car and resent that the car is moving too fast, trying to pull it backward and reverse the car." As for "left"-leaning adventurism, its characteristic is that "thinking exceeds a certain stage of development of the objective process, some regard fantasy as truth, and some forcibly place ideals that only have realistic possibilities in the future to do in the present, separating from the practice of the majority of the people at the present and separating from the current reality."

Comrade Mao Zedong fully demonstrated the necessity of the continuous development of the cognition of truth, and therefore "profoundly explained and developed the famous Engels and Lenin's principles on absolute truth and relative truth" (Truth Daily Editorial Department). Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Marxists admit that in the absolute and overall development process of the universe, the development of each specific process is relative. Therefore, in the long river of absolute truth, people's cognition of specific processes at each certain stage of development only has relative truth. The sum of countless relative truths is absolute truth."

Can we know absolute truth? The answer of Marxists is yes. Absolute truth is "the sum of countless relative truths." Therefore, the process of the continuous advancement and development of our understanding of objective things is the process of our understanding of absolute truth. As long as we continue to work hard to learn, as long as we constantly and unremittingly extract new truths from the process of practice, from the process of development of objective things, to enrich and develop old truths, we are already swimming in the "long river of absolute truth," and we can approach absolute truth through countless relative truths. Naturally, this process of swimming will never end, because "the changing movement of the objective real world will never end," and "people's cognition of truth in practice will never end"; because absolute truth itself is a living process that cannot be completed and that human cognition is increasingly developing to a higher degree. Therefore, there is no absolutely complete absolute truth imagined by metaphysicians. If we must reluctantly imagine and reluctantly pursue this absolutely complete absolute truth, and are unwilling to let the pulse of the development of the cognition of truth beat endlessly, and are unwilling to treat absolute truth as the "sum of countless relative truths," and are unwilling to admit that absolute truth simultaneously includes this relative aspect, then we will inevitably exaggerate all relative truths into absolute truths, and turn some limited living knowledge into eternally solidified corpses. However, the objective process and human practice are by no means eternally solidified corpses, but are living things that are permanently developing forward. In this way, it is bound to split people's subjective knowledge from objective reality, and split theory from practice. This will not only fail to obtain the cognition of true absolute truth, but even fail to grasp relative truth. What can be grasped is only subjective, unsubstantiated, metaphysical foolish thinking! All philosophers before Marxism who wanted to create a permanent and complete absolute system have, without exception, declared bankruptcy in the face of historical development for this reason. In terms of the problems in revolutionary work, dogmatists regard certain abstract formulas as the final and complete truth, and arbitrarily use them regardless of all conditions, places, and times. Some empiricists mistakenly regard local experience as universal truth and insist on these local experiences under any conditions, unwilling to learn new experiences. These erroneous thoughts all one-sidedly insist on the absolute nature of truth, and deny the existence of relative truth, which will inevitably lead to serious failures in various practical works.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "people's cognition of specific processes at each certain stage of development only has relative truth." This must never lead to another metaphysical and one-sided conclusion, saying that all truths are ultimately only relative and have no absolute nature. There is a kind of philosophical relativist who believes that there is no absolute objective standard of truth in the world. As long as people subjectively feel that it is the truth, it can be regarded as the truth. Therefore, everyone can regard their own right and wrong as right and wrong, without admitting that there is any real right and wrong in the world. This becomes a kind of skepticism and extreme subjectivism. Those "empirio-criticists" criticized by Lenin actually had this relativistic view. American experimentalism is a philosophical school of the same kind as empirio-criticism, and its so-called "practical effect test" standard of truth is actually a subjective standard. For example, for the reactionary bourgeoisie of the United States, if religious superstition can also produce practical effects that help them maintain their rule and earn profits, they can stubbornly regard religious superstition as truth that is as valuable as science. If science cannot show any practical effect for the benefits they require, then even Darwin's theory of evolution will be regarded as a fallacy or even a sin by them. These relativistic philosophical schools are naturally absurd. In terms of revolutionary work, some people replace policies with feelings and solve problems with temporary subjective ideas, contradicting themselves and being inconsistent. Anyway, they all regard themselves as the truth. Some empiricists wander back and forth between various piecemeal perceptual experiences, without any preference. These errors are all in fact treating truth as merely relative and subjective, and denying the existence of absolute truth.

The relative truth admitted by Marxism is by no means completely isolated from absolute truth. First, it is "people's cognition of specific processes at each certain stage of development." Therefore, its truth has an objective—absolute standard, and the standard cannot be reversed by "how people subjectively feel" at will. Second, its sum constitutes absolute truth. Therefore, it itself is a part of absolute truth. Third, it reflects a certain specific process in the absolute and overall cosmic development process. Therefore, it is an indispensable link in the infinitely extended chain of absolute truth. We cannot cut off this historical connection in the development of the cognition of truth like relativists. They mistakenly regard truth as merely subjective, temporary, and accidentally isolated, and it has no inevitable connection with its past and future human cognition. Marxists believe that the relative truth that reflects each specific process is the result of the previous development of human cognition, and at the same time it is the basis for advancing to "a higher level." To make our cognition constantly swim forward in the "long river of absolute truth," we must be good at obtaining all the positive results that human cognition has reached in each historical period as a foothold for further leaps. Dogmatists turn some truths in books that have been obtained in the past into dead formulas to bind their hands and feet, so that they lose the ability to leap forward in vivid practical experience. Empiricists are limited to the narrow circle of current perceptual knowledge, do not pay attention to learning theory, do not read books seriously, and cannot use the peak of truth that human cognition has reached as their foothold for jumping. The errors of the two kinds of subjectivism make cognition unable to advance and hinder people from jumping to "a higher level."

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his speech "Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing," once used the attitude of a good doctor who "prescribes the right medicine" to tell us how to oppose these two kinds of subjectivism. That is to make "people with book knowledge develop in the direction of practice, and then they can not stop at books, and can not make the mistake of dogmatism. People with work experience should study in terms of theory, read books seriously, and then they can make experience bring orderliness and comprehensiveness, rise to theory, and then they can not mistake local experience as universal truth, and can not make the mistake of empiricism." A very important development of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of truth in Marxism lies in summarizing these historical experiences of opposing dogmatism and empiricism, and creating the famous principle of "combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution" ("Reform Our Study") as the basic guideline for us to correctly grasp the living truth of Marxism, and as an ideological method for correcting the two deviations of dogmatism and empiricism. The center of gravity. Understanding this principle, people who have made the mistake of dogmatism will know that they should no longer memorize individual sentences in books, and regard it as an abstract absolute formula to limit the progress of cognition, but should learn those universal truths from Marxist theoretical works, that is, to learn the Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, and apply them to solve various new practical problems raised in the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. "Creating theory from the serious study of the historical reality and revolutionary reality of China" ("Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing"), in order to further enrich and develop the truth of Marxism. On the other hand, people who are empiricists will also know that they should read books seriously, so as to learn the universal truth of Marxism from Marxist theoretical works, and learn its standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to improve their low-level perceptual knowledge, and make it rise to theoretical knowledge with orderliness and comprehensiveness.

Since Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the principle of "combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution" and called for the rectification movement, in a relatively short period of time, the mistakes of dogmatism among many revolutionary leading cadres have been basically overcome, and the mistakes of empiricism have also been overcome to some extent, making the revolutionary struggle quickly achieve great victories. The re-publication of "On Practice" will promote us to further overcome dogmatism, especially to overcome empiricism, so that all cadres who participate in revolutionary practical work and research work can be better at swimming in the long river of absolute truth in Marxism, and be better at undertaking the task of knowing the world and transforming the world, so that the revolutionary movement of the Chinese people and the academic circles of China will achieve more brilliant and greater victories in the near future.

　　毛泽东同志发展了真理论
    （一）真理的问题是对于革命成败攸关的重要问题
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》，反复地论述到关于真理的问题。他依据辩证唯物论的认识原理，为我们正确地指明了真理的性质，判定真理的标准，以及如何解决理论的东西之是否符合客观真理性这个问题。他“深刻地说明了和发展了著名的恩格斯和列宁关于绝对真理和相对真理的原理、关于客观东西和主观东西的一致性的原理”（真理报编辑部）。不难看出，毛泽东同志是把这些真理的学说当作马克思列宁主义的理论基础的一个极重要的部分，并且用很大的力量来加以发挥的。毛泽东同志之所以在理论上这样重视真理的问题，归根结底，又由于它在中国革命的长期历史实践中，始终是一个成败攸关的极其重要的问题，也是一个需要用艰苦努力来解决的困难问题。
    在一九四一年的《改造我们的学习》一文里，毛泽东同志曾把近代中国人民革命斗争的历史这样作了一个简单的总结：“灾难深重的中华民族，一百年来，其优秀人物奋斗牺牲，前仆后继，摸索救国救民的真理，是可歌可泣的。但是直到第一次世界大战与俄国十月革命之后，才找到马克思主义与列宁主义这个最好的真理，作为解放我们民族的最好武器”。鸦片战争失败直到第一次世界大战和俄国十月革命期间，中国人民经过了八十年左右的斗争，由于没有找到最好的真理，革命运动始终没有获得胜利。自从中国人民找到了马克思列宁主义这个最好的真理，产生了中国共产党之后，才不过二十八年，毛泽东同志就在他的《论人民民主专政》一文里宣布中国人民自己的革命斗争已经取得了基本胜利。就中国共产党二十八年的历史来说，革命领导之能否掌握马克思列宁主义真理，也是与革命的胜败密切联系着的。在有些时期，特别是一九二七年大革命时期，以及一九三一年到一九三四年的国内战争时期，由于革命的部分领导者不了解什么是真正的马克思列宁主义真理，由于他们把错误——政治路线上的右倾机会主义和“左”倾冒险主义，思想方法上的教条主义和经验主义——误认为真理，就使革命和人民遭受了很大的损失。如果没有毛泽东同志所代表的一些革命领导者们坚持马克思列宁主义的真理，对这些错误的倾向进行不断的坚决的斗争，那么，今天中国人民的胜利是不能想像的。
    一九四五年，毛泽东同志在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上《论联合政府》的报告里说：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是适合人民利益的。共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不适合人民利益的。”真理的认识对于革命和人民是如何重要，直到现在在我们的工作干部中间，还有很多人不能深刻了解，甚至于完全不能了解。有些人不肯用刻苦努力的精神来学习马克思主义的真理，其借口是不学习理论似乎也可以照样工作，而不知道不学习理论决不能把领导工作做好，决不能在领导工作中避免错误或减少错误。有些人在工作和学习中不能够积极地坚持真理，对于真理和错误的界限划分采取无可无不可的态度，不能勇敢地来揭发错误和对错误进行斗争。对于真理缺乏积极的和严肃的态度的这一切情形，是不符合于革命和人民的利益的，是和毛泽东同志重视理论学习，重视真理的精神相违背的。
    要善于坚持真理，就必须了解什么是真理，必须学会判别真理和错误，必须懂得如何才能使我们的认识经常保持客观的真理性。而要解决这些问题，就必须认真研究《实践论》中所发挥和发展了的马克思列宁主义的真理学说，并把它应用到自己的工作和学习当中。
            （二）实践之作为真理标准的原理
    什么是真理？真理就是符合于客观事物规律性的正确认识。人的思想如果不符合于客观事物的规律性，这就不是真理的认识，而是错误的认识。如何判别真理和错误？如何证明我们的思想和认识是否合于客观事物的规律性？毛泽东同志按照马克思主义的原则给了一个明确的答复：“通过实践。”“实际的情形是这样的，只有在社会实践过程中（物质生产过程中，阶级斗争过程中，科学实验过程中），人们达到了思想中所预想的结果时，人们的认识才被证实了。人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”因此，“判定认识或理论之是否真理，不是依主观上觉得如何而定，而是依客观上社会实践的结果如何而定。真理的标准只能是社会的实践。实践的观点是辩证唯物论的认识论之第一的与基本的观点。”
    马克思在《费尔巴哈论纲》里，有这样的一段话：“人的思维是否具有对象的真理性，这个问题，并不是一个理论的问题，而是一个实践的问题。人应该在实践中证明自己思维之真理性，即真实性和威力，现实性。关于离开实践的思维是真实还是不真实的争论，乃是一个纯粹烦琐哲学的问题。”马克思在这里所规定了的基本原理，在恩格斯和列宁的著作（《费尔巴哈和德国古典哲学的终结》，《反杜林论》，《唯物论与经验批判论》等）里，都有更详细的阐明，而在毛泽东同志的《实践论》里，是更进一步地具体地发挥了。
    否认实践之作为真理标准，曾经是许多反动哲学者引人陷入唯心论和不可知论的泥沼里去的诡计，列宁对这种诡计曾在他的《唯物论与经验批判论》中给了深刻的揭露。旧社会的许多学校教师和知识分子之容易沉溺于烦琐哲学的空论，其根本的原因正是由于中了这种唯心论的毒害。忽视实践之作为真理标准的原理，或对于这原理完全无知，曾使许多人在革命工作中犯了主观主义的错误。他们闭着眼睛不肯对群众的实践经验作任何的调查研究，把道听途说的一知半解和自己主观上的“想当然”当做真理，用来任意决定政策，指导工作。凡是与他们的“想当然”不符合或不完全符合的东西，即使是在群众的实践中得到了证明的成功经验，也要戴上机会主义的帽子，给与无情的打击，凡是在他们的“想当然”指导之下的行动，即使在群众的实践当中遭到失败，碰得头破血流，仍然要找理由把它渲染成伟大的胜利，并继续向失败的墙壁上碰去，而决不肯承认失败，更不能“从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性”。中国的革命人民曾因为这些主观主义的领导者遭受过很大的损失。在今天的工作干部当中，也还存在着一些这样的主观主义倾向，他们虽然不是居于那样重要的领导地位，但如果不去注意克服自己的主观主义，那末，他在一定的地方对于工作和人民，仍然会给与相当的损失。
    坚持实践之作为真理标准的原理，来和这一类的唯心论者、主观主义者进行不调和的斗争，务必使他们放弃那种“自封为‘天下第一’”的“虚伪与骄傲”的态度，老老实实地到人民的革命实践中去学习，这对于革命、对于人民都是非常必要的。在这一方面，毛泽东同志自己就作了杰出的模范。他不但在理论上发挥了实践之作为真理标准的原理，而且更重要的是在行动上，在一切实际的革命斗争的指导上，始终坚持着这原理。和那些闭眼不看社会实践的主观主义者相反，毛泽东同志任何时候都不忘记把马克思主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合，从广大人民的实践斗争中进行调查研究，抽引出符合于客观事物规律的思想、理论、计划、方案，来反对主观主义的错误思想、理论、计划、方案，来对工作提出正确的指导。要了解毛泽东同志如何坚持这些原理，只要回想一下在一九二七年间，他如何从湖南农民运动的考察中得出与陈独秀右倾投降主义相反对的结论，或者回想一下一九三一到一九三五年期间，他如何依据当时革命斗争的具体实践经验，提出指导革命的正确路线，来反对教条主义者的“左”倾冒险主义路线，只要回想一下这些例子，就很足够了。
    这里必须提起注意，在辩证唯物论的认识论里，被当做认识发展之基础和真理标准的实践，与旧哲学中有时论到的以及受旧哲学影响的一般人思想中所了解的“实践”，是根本不同的，是一定要明确地加以区别的。旧哲学的唯心论在提到知与行、理论与实践的问题的时候，其所理解的“行”或实践是抽象的、表面的、片面的，甚至于是神秘的，反动的，其所指的内容，或者仅仅是儒家的进退洒扫式的修身行为，或者是对于某些伦理原则的所谓践履笃行，或者是黑	格尔的《用沉思来制定的改造直接的东西》，或者是庸俗的人情世故，或者是个人英雄主义的冒险行为，或者是某些腐朽的反动哲学中胡说乱道的什么内心体验。这些唯心论哲学所规定的“实践”和“行”的概念，与辩证唯物论的科学的实践概念，或马克思说的人类的“现实的感性的活动”根本不同。五四运动中间为胡适贩到中国来的美国反动资产阶级的哲学——实验主义，其所谓的“实效考验”，也是一种用科学名词伪装了的唯心论的概念。要想根据这些谬误的概念来正确解决实践和认识之间的关系问题，是不可能的。旧唯物论也不能理解什么是真正的实践行动，如像费尔巴哈，他就把实践看做低级的生理的情欲活动，“把实践只在它的污秽的犹太人的表现形式上加以理解和确定”（费尔巴哈论纲），把“实践的观点，饮食的观点”（费尔巴哈）看做一个东西。“他不了解‘革命的’，‘实践批判’的活动之意义”（马克思）。旧唯物论既然从这样低级的意义上来了解实践，因此也就不可能在认识论里把实践放在真理标准的优越地位上。
    学习《实践论》，就必须把马克思主义的科学的实践概念，和旧哲学里的那些浅薄的、混乱的、庸俗的、甚至于神秘反动的概念加以严格的区别。否则，要想正确地领会毛泽东同志的《实践论》和其中所包含的真理学说，是绝对达不到目的的。
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》，把辩证唯物论的实践概念的具体内容作了系统周密的发挥，他依据精密规定的意义，有时特别称之为“社会的实践”，或“变革现实的实践”，这就有别于旧哲学中和一般人心目中的那种意义模糊的概念，有别于那种反对变革现实的帝国主义反动派所要求的“实效”。毛泽东同志指出：“只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准。”社会实践的具体内容，最主要的，是生产活动的实践和阶级社会的各种形式的阶级斗争的实践。其中生产活动的实践，又是“最基本的实践活动”，是“人的认识发展的基本来源”，同时各种形式的阶级斗争，又“给予人的认识发展以深刻的影响。在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”
    毛泽东同志指出：人类对于真理的认识的程度，是随着社会实践的发展而发展，首先是随着生产活动的发展而发展的。“人类社会的生产活动，是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展，因此，人们的认识，不论对于自然界方面，对于社会方面，也都是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展，即由浅入深，由片面到更多的方面。”同时，在阶级社会中，阶级斗争的发展，也是人类认识发展的一个决定条件。在过去很长的一个时期中，由于生产规模的狭小，由于剥削阶级的偏见经常歪曲社会的历史，限制了人民的眼界，特别是各时代反对社会变革的反动剥削阶级，要蒙蔽历史发展的真相，这些条件使得人类对于社会和历史的认识长久缺乏全面的科学的真理性，只能限于片面的了解。但是，历史上每一次进步的变革现实社会的阶级斗争，总使人们对于真理的认识前进一步。到了伴随着巨大生产力的大工业而出现了无产阶级的时候，人们终于能够对于社会历史的发展作全面的历史的了解，这样就出现了马克思主义的科学真理。
    因此，只有“社会的实践”，“变革现实的实践”——变革自然界的生产活动和变革社会的阶级斗争的实践，才是人类认识发展的真实基础，任何人如果希望使自己对于外界的认识不断地接近客观的真理性，就只有参加在变革现实的实践当中。研究自然科学的人，必须让自己的实验室的研究以及头脑中的推理计算与工农业的社会生产活动适当地、直接地或间接地保持某种联系，才能够在发明发见方面不断地获得新的启发和不断的进步。完全脱离生产活动的自然科学研究者，纵然也可以获得一些现成的知识，但要想超出现成的知识水平而向新的真理不断接近，是困难的。旧中国的自然科学界一般的停滞不进或进步迟缓的状态，基本上是可以用反动统治下自然科学研究与生产活动的条件相隔绝来说明的。研究社会历史的人，或希望对于社会、历史以及革命的问题获得正确认识的人，必须使自己的研究与变革现实社会的阶级斗争相结合，必须参加在变革现实社会的而不是保守旧社会的阶级斗争中，才能够真正领会社会科学的真理。脱离了进步的阶级斗争的人，就今天来说，脱离了世界各国人民反对以美英帝国主义为首的一切反动势力的阶级斗争的人，以不问政治而自鸣清高的人，以少数上层人物的所谓修身践履行为而自满自足的人，留恋旧社会甚至于站在保守旧社会的反动立场上的人，要想正确认识社会历史发展和革命发展的真理，是不可能的。
            （三）接近客观真理的辩证法道路
    人们如何在实践中使自己的主观认识接近客观真理？毛泽东同志指出，这是一个依循着辩证法规律的能动的发展过程。人们在实践中对于客观真理的接近，最初只能达到“感性认识的阶段”，“感觉与印象的阶段”，我们在工作中获得的初步经验，都是属于这一个阶段的认识。在这个阶段里人们的认识是比较低级的，即只能认识外界“事物的现象，事物的各个片面以及这些事物的外部联系”，只有再经过“社会实践的继续，使人们在实践中引起感觉与印象的东西反复了多次，于是在人们的脑子里生起了一个认识过程中的突变，产生了概念。”这时人们的认识“已经不是事物的现象，不是事物的各个片面，不是它们的外部联系，而是抓着了事物的本质，事物的全体，事物的内部联系了。”这就是达到了“理性认识的阶段”。理性认识“在人们对于一个事物的整个认识过程中是更重要的阶段”，因为只有理性认识，才能使人们“了解客观事物的内部矛盾，了解它的规律性，了解这一过程与那一过程间的内部联系”。我们在工作一个时期之后，要把各方面的工作经验作一个总结，这就是为着要使认识达到理性阶段。但是，仅仅达到了理性认识阶段，还不能完全解决我们的思想之是否符合于客观真理性的问题。“要完全地解决这个问题，只有把理性的认识再回到社会实践中去，应用理论于实践，看它是否能够达到预想的目的。”如果能够达到预想的目的，那就证明理性的认识已符合于客观的真理性。如果不能达到预期的目的，或不完全能达到预期的目的，这就证明它不符合或不完全符合客观的真理性，就必须加以全部的或部分的修正。这就是在实践中“检验理论与发展理论的过程，是整个认识过程的继续”，是认识的“更重要”的阶段。我们在工作中把经验的总结制定成新的方针、计划，再用来指导工作，就是使认识进入这一个“更重要”的阶段。在这个阶段里，当然我们也还不可以把已定的方针、计划看做绝对不可改变的东西，而常常要依据工作中所产生的结果来加以必要的修正。“认识的能动作用，不但表现于从感性的认识到理性的认识之能动的飞跃，更重要的还须表现于从理性的认识到革命的实践这一个飞跃。”因为只有经过这一个“飞跃”，才能完全解决我们对于外界认识之是否符合客观真理性的问题。
    列宁在《黑格尔〈逻辑学〉一书摘要》里这样写道：“从生动的直观到抽象的思惟，从思惟到实践——这就是认识真理、认识客观实在的辩证法道路。”毛泽东同志的《实践论》，把列宁所指出的这一条认识真理的“辩证法道路”作了详尽的阐述，这是毛泽东同志对于真理论，对于实践之作为真理标准的原理所给与的重要发展。毛泽东同志的这些发展，是与中国革命历史上反对各种错误思想的斗争密切地结合着的。他总结了这些斗争经验，从认识论的基础上揭发了教条主义和经验主义这两种基本错误倾向之所以失足的原因。真理的认识必须是在实践中经过有规律的努力过程才能获得，不懂得这些必然的规律和过程，不承认对于真理的认识必须按照这些规律和过程采取老老实实的科学态度，而以为可以采取任何轻便偷巧的态度，以为仅凭乍然一看或灵机一动，而不必准备付出相当大的努力和苦心就可以猝然获得，这种无知和侥幸的态度，这种思想方法上的机会主义态度，正是各种错误认识发生的根源。教条主义之所以脱离客观真理性，就是由于脱离了实践；就是由于脱离了实践基础上的感性知识；就是由于不懂得“认识开始于经验”这一个“认识论的唯物论”原理；由于不懂得理论都是从许多经验中总结出来的这个道理；由于不懂得必须“将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念及理论的系统”，才能“从感性认识跃进到理性认识”；由于不懂得为了要取得丰富的感觉材料，就必须对于所要认识的对象及其周围环境作周密的调查研究，必须联系群众，向群众学习，从广大群众的生产活动和阶级斗争的实践经验中去获取大量的各方面的间接经验，以补个人实践的经验之不足。这样才有可能对经验作出全面的总结。总之，教条主义者不懂得感性认识是接近客观真理的一个必要阶段，因此他们也就不知道应该从实践经验中去抽出反映客观现实的生动理论，而把“道听途说的一知半解”或书本上支离破碎地抄引下来的现成条文当做公式到处乱套。这样就离开了接近客观真理的道路而走上悬空的主观主义的道路。
    经验主义者又是从另一方面遮断了人们接近客观真理的道路，这就是不了解“认识的感性阶段有待于发展到理性阶段”这一个“认识论的辩证法”原理。他们以个人所有的一点点直接实践经验自骄自满，沾沾自喜于一得之功与一孔之见，轻视各方面的间接经验，不会有系统有组织地从事周密的调查研究和学习各方面的经验，不知道把丰富的感觉材料加以改造提高使之成为理性认识的必要，不懂得总结经验的必要。他们把总结经验看做不能忍受的苦事，把阅读书籍学习理论误认为多余之举，把学习新的知识和应用头脑思考问题当做不必要的麻烦。因此，经验主义者的知识就停顿在狭小的低级的感性阶段，不可能认识事物的全体，事物的本质和事物的内部规律性，不可能在实践中“通观客观过程的全体”，掌握明确方针，看出远大前途，对于事物发展的客观真理是处在盲人的状况中。
    这样，教条主义和经验主义是在两个不同的方向上离开了认识真理的辩证法道路。毛泽东同志发展了马克思主义的真理学说，详细指明这条正确的道路，就给我们指出了避免重犯这些历史错误的明确方针。
            （四）真理的相对性和绝对性
    毛泽东同志严格依据辩证唯物论的原理，指出认识真理的过程决不是一次完结的，而是永不停息地向前推移和发展的过程。这是因为真理的认识只能是客观事物过程的正确反映，而客观事物过程，“不论是属于自然界的与属于社会的，由于内部的矛盾与斗争，都是向前推移向前发展的，人们的认识运动也应跟着推移与发展”的缘故。因此，人们对于客观事物的某一过程和某一发展阶段获得正确的认识之后，即便是在实践中受到了检验，证明其为完全符合于客观规律性的真理，仍然不能把它看做无条件的绝对真理。一旦客观事物的过程中间发生了新的推移和转变，就必须使自己的主观认识也跟着推移和转变，使之符合于新的客观过程的规律，因此，人们如果要使自己的认识经常保持客观的真理性，那就决不能在任何一个时候使自己学习的努力停顿下来，就要不断地跟着实践的发展前进，而使自己对于客观事物的认识也发展前进。“马克思列宁主义并没有结束真理，而是在实践中不断地开辟认识真理的道路。”
    毛泽东同志特别依据了革命历史实践的经验，来证明真理认识之不断发展的必要。他说：“依社会运动来说，真正的革命的指导者，不但在于当自己的思想、理论、计划、方案有错误时须得善于改正，……而且在于当某一客观过程已经从某一发展阶段向另一发展阶段推移转变的时候，须得善于使自己及参加革命的一切人员在主观认识上也跟着推移转变，即是要使新的革命任务和新的工作方案的提出，适合于新的情况的变化。革命时期情况的变化是很急速的，如果革命党人的认识不能随之而急速变化，就不能引导革命走向胜利。”
    毛泽东同志对于革命历史经验的这些总结，具体地发挥和发展了恩格斯在《反杜林论》中所指出的这一个原理：“真理和错误，像一切在两极对立中运动着的逻辑上的范畴一样，只在极端被限定的领域内，才有绝对的妥当性。”这就是说，人们的主观认识，只有当它在实践中被证明经常符合于客观的情况的时候，只有它能够不断地随着实践的发展而发展，随着客观情况的推移转变而推移转变的时候，才能经常保持它的客观真理性。这叫做“主观与客观、理论与实践、知与行的具体的历史的统一”。人们的认识如果一旦停滞不动，满足于已有的知识，把某一过程某一阶段的正确认识变成僵死的成见，不能跟着社会实践和客观过程的发展变化而发展变化，那么，原来适合于客观情况的正确认识就要变成脱离实际的主观空想，真理就要变成错误。毛泽东同志指出，这种由主观与客观的分裂，理论与实践分裂所产生的错误，就是革命的实践当中右倾机会主义和“左”倾冒险主义产生的认识论根源。右倾机会主义者是“革命队伍中的顽固派”，他们“看不出矛盾的斗争已将客观过程推向前进了，而他们的认识仍然停止在旧阶段”。“他们的思想离开了社会的实践，他们不能站在社会车轮的前头充任向导的工作，他们只知跟在车子后面怨恨车子走得太快了，企图把它向后拉，开倒车。”至于“左”的冒险主义，其特点是“思想超过客观过程的一定发展阶段，有些把幻想看作真理，有些则把仅在将来有现实可能性的理想，勉强地放在现时来做，离开了当前大多数人的实践，离开了当前的现实性”。
    毛泽东同志充分论证了真理认识之不断发展的必要，因此也就“深刻地说明了和发展了著名的恩格斯和列宁关于绝对真理和相对真理的原理”（真理报编辑部）。毛泽东同志说：“马克思主义者承认，在绝对的总的宇宙发展过程中，各个具体过程的发展都是相对的，因而在绝对真理的长河中，人们对于在各个一定发展阶段上的具体过程的认识只具有相对的真理性。无数相对的真理之总和，就是绝对的真理。”
    我们能够认识绝对真理吗？马克思主义者的答复是肯定的。绝对真理是“无数相对的真理之总和”。因此，我们对于客观事物的认识之不断前进发展的过程，就是我们认识绝对真理的过程，只要我们持续不断地努力学习，只要我们经常不懈地从实践过程中，从客观事物发展过程中，抽引出新的真理，来充实和发展旧的真理，我们就已经是亲身游泳在“绝对真理的长河中”，我们就能通过无数的相对真理来接近绝对真理。自然，这一个游泳的过程，是永远没有完结的，那是因为“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结”，而“人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结”；那是因为绝对真理的本身，就是一个不能完结的、人类认识日益向更高程度发展的活生生的过程。因此，没有形而上学者所幻想的那种最后完结了的绝对真理。如果一定要勉强去设想和勉强去追求这种最后完结了的绝对真理，不愿意使真理认识的发展脉搏永不停息地跳动下去，不愿意把绝对真理当做“无数相对的真理之总和”来看待，不愿意承认绝对真理中同时包括着这个相对的方面，那就势必要把一切相对真理都夸大成绝对真理，把一些有限的活的知识变成永远凝固的僵尸，然而客观过程和人类实践却决不是永远凝固的僵尸，而是永久向前发展的有生命的东西，这样一来，势必就要使人的主观认识和客观现实分裂，使理论和实践分裂，这就不但得不到真正的绝对真理的认识，甚至连相对真理也掌握不住，而所能掌握住的，就仅仅是主观的、经不起事实考验的、形而上学的愚想！马克思主义以前的一切想要创造永久完成的绝对体系的哲学家，都是为着这个原因而在历史发展的前面无例外地宣告破产了的。就革命工作中的问题来说，教条主义者把某些抽象的公式当做最后完成了的真理，不顾一切条件、地点、时间任意拿来乱用。有些经验主义者把局部的经验误认为普遍真理，在任何条件下都要坚持这些局部经验，不肯学习新的经验。这些错误思想，都是片面地坚持真理的绝对性质，而否认相对真理的存在，在各种实际工作中，是都要遭到严重的失败的。
    毛泽东同志指出“人们对于在各个一定发展阶段上的具体过程的认识只具有相对的真理性”，这决不能得到另外一种形而上学的片面的结论，说一切真理归根结底都只是相对的，而没有任何绝对的性质。有一种哲学上的相对主义者，以为世界上的真理是没有任何绝对的客观标准的，只要人们主观上觉得是真理，就可以算做真理，因此人人都可以把自己的是非作为是非，而不必承认世界上有什么真正的是非，这就成为一种怀疑主义和极端的主观主义。列宁所批评的那些“经验批判论”者们，在实际上都有这种相对主义的看法。美国的实验主义是与经验批判论同类的哲学流派，它的所谓“实效考验”的真理标准，实际上也是一种主观的标准。例如对于美国的反动资产阶级，如果宗教迷信也能产生帮助他们维持统治和赚取利润的实效，他们就可以硬把宗教迷信看做和科学同样有价值的真理。如果科学对于他们所要求的利益不能表现什么实效，那么就是达尔文的进化论真理也要被他们当做谬误甚至于罪恶看待。这些相对主义的哲学流派自然是荒谬绝伦的。就革命工作来说，有些人以感想代政策，凭着主观上的临时的想法来解决问题，出尔反尔，前后矛盾，反正都自认为真理。有些经验主义者在各种零星的感性经验之间游移来游移去，无可无不可。这些错误都是在实际上把真理看做仅仅相对的，主观的东西，而否认了绝对真理的存在。
    马克思主义所承认的相对真理，决不是与绝对真理完全隔绝的。第一，它是“人们对于在各个一定发展阶段上的具体过程的认识”，因此它的真理性就有着客观的——绝对的标准，而不能由人的“主观上觉得如何”来随便颠倒是非的标准。第二，它的总和构成了绝对真理，因此它本身就是绝对真理的一部分。第三，它反映着绝对的总的宇宙发展过程中的一定具体过程，因此它在绝对真理的无限延长的链锁中是不可少的环节，我们不能像相对主义者那样割断真理的认识发展中的这一种历史联系，他们把真理误认为只是主观的、暂时的、偶然地孤立出现的，与它的过去和将来的人类认识没有什么必然联系的。马克思主义者认为，反映每一具体过程的相对真理，都是以前人类认识发展的结果，而同时又是以后进到“高一级的程度”的基础。要使我们的认识不断地在“绝对真理的长河中”向前游泳，就必须善于取得在每一历史时期人类认识发展所达到的一切积极成果，作为更进一步跳跃的立脚点。教条主义者把过去已经获得的某些书本上的真理变成死的公式，来束缚着自己的手脚，以致失去了在生动的实践经验中向前跳跃的能力。经验主义者局限在当前的狭小的感性知识圈子里，不重视学习理论，不认真读书，不能把人类认识已达到的真理的高峰作为自己跳跃的立脚点。两种主观主义的错误都使认识不能前进，障碍着人们向“高一级的程度”跳跃。
    毛泽东同志在《整顿学风党风文风》的演讲里，曾经用“对症下药”的良医态度，告诉我们如何来反对这两种主观主义。这就是要使“有书本知识的人向实际方向发展，然后才可以不停止在书本上，才可以不犯教条主义的错误。有工作经验的人，要向理论方面学习，要认真读书，然后才可以使经验带上条理性，综合性，上升到理论，然后才可以不把局部经验误认为即是普遍真理，才可以不犯经验主义的错误。”毛泽东同志对于马克思主义的真理论所给与的一个极重要的发展，是在于总结反对教条主义和经验主义的这些历史经验，而创造了著名的“马、恩、列、斯主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践互相结合”（《改造我们的学习》）的原理，作为我们正确掌握马克思主义活的真理的基本方针，作为纠正教条主义与经验主义这两种偏向的一个思想方法的重心。懂得了这个原理，犯过教条主义毛病的人就知道不应该再去死记书本上的个别文句，并把它当做抽象的绝对的公式来限制认识的前进，而是要从马克思主义的理论著作中学取那些普遍真理，也就是要学习马克思主义的立场、观点、方法，并应用它来解决中国革命的具体实践中所提出的各种新的实际问题。“从中国的历史实际与革命实际的认真研究中创造出理论来”（《整顿学风党风文风》），以便进一步丰富和发展马克思主义的真理。另一方面，犯经验主义的人也就知道应该认真读书，以便从马克思主义的理论著作中学习马克思主义的普遍真理，学习它的立场、观点、方法来提高自己的低级的感性认识，使之上升为有条理性，综合性的理论知识。
    自从毛泽东同志提出“马、恩、列、斯主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践互相结合”的原理，号召了整风运动以来，在较短的时期里，就在基本上克服了许多革命领导干部中间的教条主义的毛病，也在某种程度上克服了经验主义的毛病，使革命斗争迅速获得伟大的胜利。《实践论》的重新发表，将推动我们进一步去克服教条主义，尤其是克服经验主义，使一切参加革命的实际工作和研究工作的干部更善于在马克思主义的绝对真理的长河中游泳，更善于担当认识世界和改造世界的任务，使中国人民的革命运动和中国的学术界在不久的将来获得更光辉更伟大的胜利。
