　　Method for Renewing Newspaper Subscriptions Should Be Improved
　　To the Editor:
　　Our bureau subscribed to one copy of the People's Daily at the Gaoyao Post Office. However, due to being busy in March, we did not renew the subscription in time, and only realized it when the newspaper was stopped. We immediately went to the post office to renew, but the post office could only renew from March 21st onwards; the post office would not provide back issues from March 1st to 20th. We feel this is very inconvenient, and request that you find a way to purchase them for us!
                                 Gaoyao County People's Government Grain Bureau

    Editor's Note: The highest principle of all distribution procedures and systems should be to facilitate the reader. This newspaper often receives letters from readers saying, "The newspaper was stopped without prior notice." Some post offices still limit subscriptions to the beginning or middle of the month, and do not process them afterwards. These are not ways to facilitate readers, and are naturally related to the insufficient staffing of post offices in various places. We hope the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will conduct a thorough inspection and improve this.

### 续定报纸办法应加改善

专栏：读者来信

　　续定报纸办法应加改善编辑同志：
    我局曾在高要邮局定有人民日报一份。但三月份因事忙未及续定，至报纸被停送才发觉。跟即到邮局去续订，但邮局只能从三月二十一日起，三月一日至二十日报纸，邮局就不给补购。我们感到非常不方便，请设法代购为盼！
                                 高要县人民政府粮食局
    编者按：一切发行手续和制度的最高原则应该是为了便利读者。本报常接到读者来信说，“事先没有得到通知就把报纸停了”。有的邮局现在还有限定在月初或月半才能订报，过时不理等情形。这些都不是便利读者的做法，这自然与各地邮局人员配备不够有关。望邮电部深入检查一下，并予以改善。
