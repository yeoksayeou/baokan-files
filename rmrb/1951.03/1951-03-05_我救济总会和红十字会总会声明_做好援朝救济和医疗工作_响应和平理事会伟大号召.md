　　China Relief and Red Cross Societies Issue Statement:
    Do a Good Job in Aiding Korea and Providing Medical Care, Respond to the Great Call of the World Peace Council
    The China People's Relief Association and the Red Cross Society of China issued a statement endorsing the declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Council, stating:
    The declaration and all resolutions of the World Peace Council represent the will of peace-loving people around the world, and we warmly endorse them.
    Concluding a peace pact is a great suggestion for defending world peace and a peaceful cry from the people of the world. Anyone who does not accept it is an enemy of the people.
    All resolutions on resolving the German, Japanese, and Korean issues peacefully are precisely the wishes of the German, Japanese, and Korean people. The people of every country have the right to handle their own country's affairs. Korean internal affairs can only be decided by the Korean people themselves; this is the fairest and most reasonable. Anyone who disagrees and insists on interfering intends to undermine peace and is an aggressor.
    People in the national relief and welfare circles have always hated aggression and loved peace. Resisting America and aiding Korea is to defend peace. Relieving Korean refugees and providing medical care to wounded and sick Chinese and Korean soldiers is an indispensable part of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. We, the China People's Relief Association and the Red Cross Society of China, call on all people in the national relief and welfare circles and Red Cross members to redouble their efforts to do a good job in relieving Korean refugees and dispatching medical and epidemic prevention teams to Korea, and resolutely strive for the realization of the declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Council.

　　我救济总会和红十字会总会声明
    做好援朝救济和医疗工作  响应和平理事会伟大号召
    中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会总会发表拥护世界和平理事会宣言及决议的声明称：
    世界和平理事会的宣言和一切决议，代表了全世界爱好和平人民的意志，我们热忱拥护。
    缔结和平公约，这是保卫世界和平的伟大建议，是全世界人民的和平呼声，谁不接受，谁就是人民的公敌。
    以和平方式解决德国、日本和朝鲜问题的一切决议，正是德国、日本和朝鲜人民的愿望。每一个国家的人民都有权处理自己国家的问题。朝鲜内政只有由朝鲜人民自行决定，这是最公平合理的。谁要不赞成，一定要加以干涉，谁就有意破坏和平，就是侵略者。
    全国救济福利界人士向来痛恨侵略，酷爱和平。抗美援朝就是保卫和平，救济朝鲜难民与医疗中朝人民战士伤病员，是抗美援朝运动中不可缺少的部分；我们，中国人民救济总会和中国红十字会总会，号召全国救济福利界和红十字会会员，加倍努力做好救济朝鲜难民与派遣赴朝医防队的工作，决为争取世界和平理事会的宣言和决议的实现而奋斗。
