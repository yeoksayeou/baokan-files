　　The National Sports Federation Preparatory Committee decided to hold the 1951 National Men's and Women's Basketball and Volleyball Tournament in Beijing on May 4th in order to further promote sports activities for the purpose of national defense and construction, and to select team members to participate in this year's World Youth Festival in Berlin. The committee issued a notice on the first of this month. The notice stipulates the competition events: men's basketball, women's basketball, men's six-player volleyball, and women's six-player volleyball. Competing units: Each major administrative region (North China, Northeast, Central South, East China, Northwest, Southwest, etc.) will select one men's and women's basketball and volleyball team, for a total of four teams. Each team (including the leader and staff) should not exceed twenty people. Competition method: The provincial capitals and cities equivalent to provincial capitals (military units are based on major military regions) will be the preliminary competition units. All units and teams in the city can sign up to participate in the competition. Larger cities can be divided into four groups (workers, government organs, troops, schools) to conduct elimination matches. After the winners of the four groups are determined, they will attend the major administrative region competition. The major administrative region will be the semi-final unit. Cities and regions that do not participate in the national competition can hold their own city and regional competitions. The notice also requires that all localities use this national competition to improve sports activities on the original basis and make them a regular activity, establish regular basketball and volleyball organizations, and cultivate a large number of amateur basketball and volleyball activists. Registration date: All teams must arrive in Beijing for registration before May 1, 1951.

    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation issued a notice on the 3rd of this month regarding mobilizing participation in the 1951 National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament. The full text is as follows:
    The decision of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation to hold the 1951 National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament in Beijing on "May Fourth" Youth Day is completely necessary and timely. Our motherland is carrying out great and arduous national defense construction and production construction. The people of the whole country must not only have patriotic enthusiasm, master scientific knowledge and skills, but also have a strong physique and physical strength. Sports activities are of positive significance for improving human health, cultivating the people's excellent qualities, and conducting patriotic education, and urgently need to be gradually developed in a planned and step-by-step manner among organized groups on the existing weak foundation. Educational administrative organs at all levels across the country, political departments of all field armies, military regions, special forces, trade unions, New Democratic Youth League, women's federations, and student federations in all provinces and cities should actively mobilize the broad masses to participate in the district preliminaries of the 1951 National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament that will be held soon. Through this competition, strive to establish regular grassroots organizations for basketball and volleyball in various regions, so that sports activities become regular mass activities, so as to strengthen the strength of the motherland's national defense and production construction.
