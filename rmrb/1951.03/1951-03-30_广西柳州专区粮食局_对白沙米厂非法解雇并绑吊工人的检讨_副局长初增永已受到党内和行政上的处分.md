Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Liuzhou Special District Grain Bureau, Guangxi Province
    Self-criticism Regarding Illegal Dismissal and Torture of Workers at Baisha Rice Mill; Deputy Director Chu Zengyong Has Been Disciplined Within the Party and Administratively

    To the Editors:
    The "Letters from Readers" column in your newspaper on February 12 published a criticism from Comrade Wei Youjian regarding the illegal dismissal and torture of workers at our Baisha Rice Mill. This is a tremendous lesson for us. It proves that we have not done enough in educating our cadres in the past. Comrade Chu Zengyong, Deputy Director of our bureau (your newspaper mistakenly identified him as Deputy Factory Director), transferred from the military to take up this work. He carried with him remnants of warlordism. Although we had given him individual suggestions, we never rigorously waged an uncompromising struggle against this style, which allowed his bad style to develop, leading to this serious error of violating the law, infringing on human rights, and disrespecting the interests of workers. We now provide a brief summary of the incident and its handling as follows:

    (1) It is true that workers Pu Jiahe and Jie Wenlu did not perform well in their work and had engaged in some petty theft. However, the administrative cadres of the rice mill did not report this situation to the Grain Bureau, nor did they properly educate the workers. After Comrade Chu Zengyong went to the rice mill to understand the situation, he neither requested instructions from the Special Commissioner's Office nor consulted with other cadres of the Grain Bureau, and even more so did not go through the factory's trade union, and then he arbitrarily decided to dismiss Pu Jiahe and Jie Wenlu. Afterwards, Director Liu Yadong held a workers' meeting at the rice mill to make a self-criticism regarding this matter.

    (2) Comrade Li Yongheng, who was hung up and beaten by Comrade Chu Zengyong, is also a cadre who transferred from the military. He had been in the army for several years, but his performance had not always been good. Because of the dismissal of the workers, he had an argument with Comrade Chu Zengyong. Comrade Chu Zengyong then illegally tied him up and hung him. Later, Director Liu Yadong found out about this, immediately intervened to stop it, and reported it to the Special Commissioner's Office.

    (3) The administrative leadership of the rice mill has consistently rarely sought the opinions of the workers. Problems in the factory were decided upon by administrative cadres in meetings; there was no talk of democratic management or reliance on the working class. Although there was a trade union organization in the factory, it failed to function. In addition to urging the workers to work, the administrative cadres did not educate the workers and did not care enough about them. The workers' food ration was originally three jin of rice per person per day, but after the workers reported that they were not full, it was increased to three and a half jin of rice. Last December, it was discovered that the food expenses for November had been overspent. Without consulting the workers, the administrative cadres deducted 300 yuan from the workers' daily vegetable money to make up for the shortfall in November. When the workers questioned this, the administration then explained to the workers, which was of course very wrong.

    (4) Before last December, the factory machinery often broke down, and production could not reach normal levels. After December, the production task was increased from 180 bags of grain per day to 240 bags of grain, and the number of workers was also increased from six to ten. Comrade Wei Youjian's criticism that our task was increased while the number of workers decreased is untrue.

    Regarding the mistakes committed by Comrade Chu Zengyong, he has been criticized in an administrative notice and given a public warning within the Party. Workers Pu Jiahe and Jie Wenlu, who were dismissed, have each been given a living allowance of 100 jin of rice.

    广西柳州专区粮食局
    对白沙米厂非法解雇并绑吊工人的检讨
    副局长初增永已受到党内和行政上的处分编辑同志：
    贵报二月十二日《读者来信》栏发表了韦有健同志对我局白沙米厂非法解雇并绑吊工人的事件提出批评。这给我们一次莫大的教育。这事证明了我们过去对干部教育得很不够。我局副局长初增永同志（贵报误为副厂长）系自部队转业参加工作，他带有军阀主义残余作风。我们虽曾个别对他提过意见，但始终没有严格地对他这种作风进行不调和的斗争，这样就纵容了他的恶劣作风的发展，以致产生了这次违犯法令、侵犯人权和不尊重工人利益的严重错误。现在我们将事情经过和处理结果简复如下：（一）工人普家和与解文禄平日工作不好是事实，也有过一些偷窃行为。但米厂行政干部并没有把这一情况反映到粮食局，也没有很好地对工人进行教育。初增永同志到米厂了解情况后，既没有请示专署，也没有和粮食局其他干部商量，更没有通过工厂工会，就擅自决定把普家和、解文禄解雇了。事后刘亚东局长为此曾在米厂开了一次工人大会，对这件事作了检讨。
    （二）被初增永同志吊打的李永恒同志，也是从部队转业的干部。他参军已有数年，但一向表现不太好。因为解雇工人的事，他和初增永同志发生争吵。初增永同志就非法把他绑吊起来。后来刘亚东局长知道了，立即进行劝阻，并报告了专署。
    （三）米厂行政领导上一贯很少征求工人意见，厂里的问题都是行政干部开会研究作决定，谈不上民主管理和依靠工人阶级。厂里虽有工会组织，但未能起作用。行政干部除督催工人工作外，没有对工人进行教育，对工人是不够关心的。该厂工人伙食原来每人每天三斤米，后来工人反映吃不饱，始增加到三斤半米。去年十二月发觉十一月份伙食超支了。行政干部没有通过工人，便从工人每天的菜金中扣三百元以补十一月份的不足，当工人提出质问后，行政才向工人解释，这当然很不对。
    （四）去年十二月以前工厂机器常出故障，生产量不能达到正常水平。十二月以后生产任务由每天一百八十包谷增加到二百四十包谷，同时工人也由六人增到十人。韦有健同志批评我们任务增加工人减少是失实。
    对于初增永同志所犯的错误，行政已予通报批评，党内则给予当众警告处分。对于被解雇的工人普家和、解文禄，已各补发给一百斤米的生活补助费。
