　　"Our Great Motherland"
    Inspires Us to Redouble Our Efforts to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Letter from Ren Ke, Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions:
    The pictures of "Our Great Motherland" have given us a great deal of education. For example, when we saw the "Observatory" in Gaocheng Town, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, published in the newspaper on March 10th, it enabled us to know that as early as six hundred years ago, our ancestors knew how to master scientific astronomical knowledge; and when we saw the palaces of the ancient emperors, it not only made us realize that these great buildings were created by the working people, but also made us realize how extravagant and lustful the ancient rulers were. Other pictures, such as those reflecting the lives of peasants after the land reform, and those reflecting the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, all make us realize the fundamental difference between today's society and the past society. These pictures have swept away some of our remaining incorrect ideas, and they have made us see the bright future of our great motherland and inspired our work enthusiasm.
    In the past, due to the dark rule of the Kuomintang traitorous and reactionary government, we were subjected to pro-American and worship-American enslavement education, so that we knew very little about the outstanding achievements of our own people in culture, science, art, and other fields. They erased all of this, wanted us to despise our own country and people, and wanted us to become pro-American slaves who thought "the moon is better in America." In such a dark society, the people were abused and despised everywhere, and were called "inferior people," and even we ourselves thought so. Many people even felt that being born Chinese was a great misfortune, as if the word "China" was synonymous with ignorance and stupidity. The poison we suffered was profound.
    But now, everything is completely different. We, the working people, have taken control of our own political power, and our people truly have their own motherland. We are beginning to understand the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and at the same time we also know that this victory was achieved by our working people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after a long period of bloody struggle. This is our pride and our glory!
    May we be able to further build, consolidate, and defend our motherland. Especially today, when the brutal enemy, U.S. imperialism, is carrying out massacres in the people's Korea and plotting to expand its war of aggression and rearm Japan, we should strengthen patriotic and internationalist education to further develop and popularize the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. At present, newspapers and magazines in various places have deeply attached importance to this work, but we believe that some places have not done enough to make it popular and in-depth, and we hope that the People's Daily can work harder in this regard.
    Editor's Note: Comrade Ren Ke of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' letter is enthusiastic. As he said, in order to strengthen patriotic and internationalist education, and to further develop and popularize the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the propaganda of this movement in some local newspapers and magazines is not popular and in-depth enough. We believe this opinion is worth noting.

　　“我们伟大的祖国”
    鼓舞我们百倍努力抗美援朝   
    杭州市总工会韧克来信说：
    “我们伟大的祖国”图片，给了我们很多的教育。譬如当我们看到三月十日报上所刊载的河南省登封县告成镇六百年前的“观星台”，它便能够使我们知道，早在六百年前，我们的祖先便懂得掌握科学的天文知识了；又如当我们看到了古代皇帝的宫殿，它不仅使我们认识到这些伟大的建筑都是劳动人民创造的，同时也使我们认识了古代的统治者们是如何的穷侈极欲。其它如反映土地改革后农民生活的图片，以及反映抗美援朝保家卫国运动的图片，也都无不使我们认识到今天的社会和过去的社会的根本不同。这些图片，扫除了我们某些残余的不正确思想，它使我们看到了伟大祖国的远景，鼓舞了我们的工作热情。
    在过去，由于国民党卖国反动政府的黑暗统治，对我们所施行的是亲美、崇美的奴化教育，使我们对于自己祖国的人民在文化、科学、艺术等方面的卓越成就，都很少知道。他们抹杀这一切，要我们轻视自己的国家和人民，要我们都变成“月亮也是美国好”的崇美奴才。在那样黑暗的社会里，人民到处受虐待，被鄙视，所谓是“下等人”，连我们自己也这样想。甚至有好多人觉得：生为中国人是一种大不幸的事，彷佛“中国”这两个字就是无知、愚蠢的代名词。我们所受的毒害是深重的。
    但现在，完全不同了，我们劳动人民掌握了自己的政权，我们的人民真正有了自己的祖国。我们开始懂得了自己祖国的伟大和可爱，同时我们也知道了这种胜利，是由于我们的劳动人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，经过了长时期的浴血斗争才得来的。这是我们的骄傲，也是我们的光荣！
    愿我们能更进一步地来建设、巩固、保卫我们的祖国罢，尤其当凶残的敌人——美国帝国主义正在人民的朝鲜进行着屠杀和阴谋扩大侵略战争重新武装日本的今天，我们就更应当加强爱国主义与国际主义的教育，来进一步开展、普及抗美援朝保家卫国运动。目前各地的报章杂志已深深地重视这一工作了，但我们认为有些地方还做得不够通俗和深入，希望人民日报在这一方面能更努力一些。
    编者按：杭州市总工会韧克同志的来信是热情的。如他所说，为了加强爱国主义与国际主义教育，和更进一步开展、普及抗美援朝保家卫国运动；在有些地方的报章杂志，对于这一运动的宣传还做得不够通俗和深入。我们认为这一意见是很值得注意的。
