    Yexian Publicly Operated Cotton Gin Does Not Accept Union's Opinions
    Forty-Eight Accidents Occur in Four Months
    Causes Now Found and Safety Regulations Established

    The Yexian Publicly Operated Cotton Gin in Pingyuan Province neglects safe production, and accidents have occurred continuously, seriously affecting the safety of employees. Wu Xinjiang, chairman of the factory union, had repeatedly suggested to the administration: workers should not get off the vehicles to pick up cotton while the machines are running, to avoid accidents. However, the administrative leaders of the factory ignored this, resulting in an incident on January 14 when female worker Li Baozhi got off the vehicle to pick up cotton and her hair got tangled in the axle, scalping a large part of her head, causing her to bleed profusely and lose consciousness on the spot.

    Upon hearing the news, the Anyang Prefectural Labor Section and the Anyang Office of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions sent personnel to the factory on January 20 to assist in the inspection. They discovered that from September of last year to January of this year, a total of forty-eight accidents had occurred in four months, and fifteen of the thirty-three female workers had been injured. Some workers, after being injured, were afraid of being scolded and dared not speak up. Workers reflected: "If we don't pick up cotton, we are afraid that the work section administrator will give us a bad look. If we don't do the work well, we are afraid the administration won't use us."

    Through this inspection, with the help of the Anyang Prefectural Labor Section and the Anyang Office of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the factory, in response to the causes of the accidents, began to formulate safety regulations. For example: workers must not get off the vehicles to pick up cotton while the machines are running; they must wear head coverings, tie their sleeves and pant legs while working. A security committee has been established to regularly study security issues.

    邺县公营轧花厂不接受工会意见
    四个月发生事故四十八次
    现已找出原因订立安全制度编辑同志：
    平原省邺县公营轧花厂忽视安全生产，连续发生事故，严重地影响职工安全。该厂工会主席吴心嘉过去曾再三向行政提出：机器开动时，工人不宜下车拾花，以免发生事故。但该厂行政领导竟置之不理，以致一月十四日发生女工李保枝下车拾花时因头发被车轴缠着，被卷掉大半头皮，当场血流如注，不省人事。
    安阳专署劳动科和省总工会安阳办事处闻讯后，于元月二十日派员赴该厂协助进行检查，发现自去年九月至今年一月，四个月中共发生事故达四十八次之多，三十三个女工中有十五个女工受过伤。有的工友在受伤后，怕挨骂不敢说。工人们反映：“不拾花怕工务股管理员看见了给脸色看。活做不好怕行政不用咱。”
    经这次的检查，该厂在安阳专署劳动科和省总工会安阳办事处的帮助下，针对发生事故的原因，着手订出了安全制度。如：在机器开动时工人不得下车拾花，工作时包头、扎袖口和裤口。成立保安委员会，经常研究保安问题。
