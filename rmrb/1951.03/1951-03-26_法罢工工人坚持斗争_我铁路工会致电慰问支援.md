Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 24th—Despite the French government having issued 40,000 conscription orders and threatening workers with prison sentences, the strike movement in France is still expanding. In the mines of northern France, several thousand coal miners walked out of the pits on the 23rd, staging a strike. Tram and bus workers in Bordeaux also joined the ranks of the strike. Workers at the Brest Naval Shipyard also went on strike for a day to protest the high cost of living.

　　500,000 railway workers continued their strike on the 23rd, and transport workers in Paris and gas and electricity workers also continued to persevere in their struggle. The French Ministry of the Interior admitted that 60 percent of the 40,000 conscription orders issued on the 22nd had not yet taken effect. A group of railway employees in Lyon even burned the conscription orders issued to them in front of the Railway Administration.

　　In the face of the strong force of solidarity and struggle of the French working class, French Minister of Information Gazier said on the 23rd, "The government has agreed to immediately resume collective bargaining with the railway union." According to UPI, Queuille and his government are considering a general wage increase of 10 to 12 percent, but the union's demand is a 15 percent wage increase.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 25th—Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor on the 24th, addressed to all French transport and railway striking workers, expressing condolences for their just strike struggle. The original telegram stated: I, on behalf of the Chinese railway workers, extend warm condolences and support to your just struggle for increased wages. I hope you will unite closely until the final victory.

　　法罢工工人坚持斗争
    我铁路工会致电慰问支援
    【新华社二十四日讯】巴黎消息：尽管法国政府已经发出四万份征召令，并用判处徒刑来威胁工人，但是，法国的罢工运动仍在扩大中。在法国北部的矿山里，好几千采煤工人在二十三日走出矿坑，实行罢工。波尔多的电车工人和公共汽车工人，也参加了罢工的行列。布勒斯特海军兵工厂的工人也罢工一天，抗议生活费用的高涨。
    五十万铁路工人在二十三日继续罢工，巴黎的交通工人和煤汽、电力工人也继续坚持斗争。法国内政部承认：二十二日发出的四万份征召令中，百分之六十迄未发生效力。里昂的一群铁路员工甚至在铁路管理局门口就把发给他们的征召令烧掉。
    在法国工人阶级团结斗争的强大力量面前，葛义政府的新闻部长加齐埃二十三日说：“政府已同意马上和铁路工会恢复集体谈判。”据合众社透露，葛义和他的政府正在考虑普遍增加工资百分之十至十二，但工会的要求是增加工资百分之十五。
    【新华社二十五日讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯，二十四日致电法国总工会并转法国全体运输及铁路罢工工人，对他们正义的罢工斗争表示慰问。原电说：我代表中国铁路工人对你们为争取增加工资的正义斗争致以热烈的慰问与支援。希望你们紧密团结直到最后胜利。
