Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 20th: Zhi Gong Party Chairman Chen Qiyou issued a statement on March 19th protesting the atrocities of the Malayan colonial authorities in persecuting Overseas Chinese, stating:

　　The British colonial authorities in Malaya have consistently adopted a reactionary policy of persecuting our Overseas Chinese compatriots. They have not only turned a deaf ear to the solemn protests repeatedly raised by our people, but have also intensified their destruction and persecution of our Overseas Chinese.

　　Recently, the Malayan authorities have unreasonably arrested large numbers of Overseas Chinese and imprisoned them in concentration camps; they have created horrifying "dead zones" in areas with concentrated populations of our Overseas Chinese compatriots; houses along the railway from Kajang to Johor in Malaya have been completely burned down by British troops, and the property losses of Overseas Chinese are countless.

　　As the people's liberation struggle in Malaya grows stronger, the British imperialist colonial authorities have promulgated the so-called "Manpower Mobilization Ordinance," forcing our Overseas Chinese compatriots to participate in the shameful war of slaughter against the Malayan people. On average, one out of every six young Overseas Chinese compatriots is dragged off to serve as cannon fodder. As a result, many Overseas Chinese have been forced to abandon their hard-earned property, their wives and children separated, and they have returned to their motherland alone, in unspeakable misery. The majority of Overseas Chinese are still under the iron heel of the British imperialist colonial authorities, living in dire straits.

　　We lodge a solemn protest against these atrocities of the Malayan authorities in destroying and persecuting Overseas Chinese. We fully agree with the organization of the China People's Relief of Malayan Refugees Investigation Group and its mission to Malaya to investigate the actual situation of the suffering of our Overseas Chinese compatriots, and we warmly support this just and necessary action. We, all Overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Malaya in destroying and persecuting our Overseas Chinese and will wage an effective and lasting struggle to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese.

    抗议马来亚英当局迫害华侨
    【新华社广州二十日电】中国致公党主席陈其尤于三月十九日为抗议马来亚殖民当局迫害华侨暴行发表谈话称：
    马来亚英国殖民当局一向采取迫害我国侨胞的反动政策，对我国人民迭次提出的严正抗议，不仅置若罔闻，而且变本加厉地摧残和迫害我国华侨。
    最近马来亚当局横蛮无理地大批逮捕华侨，关入集中营；在我侨胞集中地区制造了骇人听闻的“死地”；从马来亚加影到柔佛沿铁路两旁的民众房屋，全被英军烧毁，华侨财产损失不计其数。
    由于马来亚殖民地人民解放斗争日益壮大，英帝国主义殖民当局颁布所谓“人力动员条例”，强迫我侨胞参加可耻的对马来亚人民的屠杀战争，平均每六个青年侨胞，就有一个被拉去充当炮灰。因此，不少侨胞被迫抛弃血汗积累的财产，妻离子散，只身逃回祖国，惨不堪言。而大多数的侨胞，还处在英帝国主义殖民当局的铁蹄下，过着水深火热的日子。
    我们对马来亚当局这些摧残和迫害华侨的暴行，提出严正的抗议。我们完全同意中国人民救济马来亚难侨调查团的组织及前赴马来亚调查我侨胞受难的实际情况，并热烈支持这一正义而必要的行动。我们全体华侨以及全国人民，坚决反对马来亚英国殖民当局摧残和迫害我国华侨的暴行，为维护华侨正当权益作有效的持久的斗争。
