Consolidate National Defense and Develop the Economy
     ——Report at the Third Expanded Meeting of the Northeast People's Government Committee on February 27 (Abstract)
    (Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government)
            (I)
    In the great and victorious struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, the people of Northeast China gloriously completed the 1950 economic construction plan. Through this year's efforts, Northeast China's economic construction has made great progress, and its national defense strength has also been further consolidated.
    In 1950, the total output value of state-owned industries and crops in the Northeast region increased by 71.7% compared with 1949, with industry increasing by 117.3% and agriculture increasing by 44.1%. The total output value of state-owned industries in 1950 exceeded the original plan by 10%. The number of employees increased by 35.2% compared with 1949. Agricultural production also exceeded the plan. The total output of the entire region exceeded the original plan by more than 6%. Railway transportation exceeded the annual loading plan by 9.2%.
    Due to the development of state-owned enterprises and agriculture, as well as the implementation of the policy of benefiting both public and private interests and labor and capital, Northeast China's private industry and commerce have also developed significantly. Taking Shenyang City as an example, in December 1949, there were 12,007 private industrial enterprises in the city, employing 50,413 people. By November 1950, the number of enterprises had increased by 30.2%, and the number of employees had increased by 32.4%.
    The above is a general overview of the development of industrial and agricultural production in Northeast China in 1950. This overview shows that the industrial level of Northeast China has improved another step compared with 1949. In terms of industrial production, particular emphasis was placed on the restoration and development of the production of means of production. In 1950, means of production accounted for 77% of the total output value of state-owned industries in Northeast China, and means of livelihood accounted for 23%. Obviously, in order to strengthen our national defense and expand the foundation of our industry, we must adopt the policy of first restoring and developing heavy industry.
    Of course, this does not mean that we have relaxed the production and supply of people's daily necessities. In this year, judging only from the output of yarn, cloth, paper, and other products of the factories under the Ministry of Industry, compared with 1949, cotton yarn was equal to 250.4%, cotton cloth was equal to 246.5%, and paper was equal to 220.5%. At the same time, state-owned stores supplied 126% more daily necessities to the people than in 1949. Taking only cotton cloth as an example, 4 million bolts (bundles) were supplied to the people in 1949, and 9.02 million bolts (bundles) were supplied in 1950, an increase of 125% in one year. In order to facilitate commodity circulation, state-owned stores expanded to 1,721, an increase of 661 compared with 1949, and cooperatives expanded to 10,335, with membership reaching 10.07 million (third quarter figures).
    The development of the economy has greatly opened up financial resources, thereby ensuring the balance of financial revenue and expenditure and guaranteeing national defense expenditures and economic construction investment. The actual revenue of the entire Northeast region in 1950 exceeded the original plan by 21.7%. Expenditures have achieved reasonable retrenchment and savings.
    The development of the economy not only guaranteed the needs of national defense construction but also enabled the people's lives to be considerably improved. In 1950, factories and mines under the Northeast Industry Department not only increased employment but also increased wages and increased employee housing and other welfare services. Taking the heavy industry sector as an example, the average wage per person increased from 140 points in December 1949 to 157 points, an average increase of 12.5%. The entire Ministry of Industry system built more than 1.56 million square meters of dormitories for employees (including clubs and hospitals, etc.) and appropriately improved labor conditions. The improvement of farmers' lives is even more significant. In 1950, farmers' purchasing power increased by approximately 33% compared with the previous year. Taking only cotton cloth as an example, in 1949, an average of one bolt of cloth was bought for every ten people, while in 1950, an average of one bolt of cloth was bought for every four and a half people. As a result, many farmers added carts and bought horses, repaired houses, added clothes and changed bedding, and raised fat pigs and strong horses, with chickens and ducks in flocks, and their lives are getting better and better every day.
    The achievements of economic construction have also laid a material foundation for the development of cultural construction. In 1950, the number of primary school students in Northeast China developed to 4,576,111, the number of middle school students developed to 155,748 (first half of the year statistics), and the number of university students developed to 17,978. The quality of teaching has also improved. Seven new worker-peasant rapid middle schools were developed, with 1,550 students. There are three worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools, with 3,311 students. Approximately 360,000 employees received supplementary education, and approximately 1.8 million farmers participated in long-term amateur cultural learning. In 1950, 4.5 million farmers participated in winter schools. In addition, farmers spontaneously established 2,673 village schools, with more than 206,000 students. Newspapers, publishing, broadcasting, literature, film, and other mass cultural undertakings have all achieved new developments and new achievements under the close integration of current central tasks.
    In terms of health, in 1950, there were 273 county-level health centers or hospitals, 923 district health stations, 241 maternal and child health stations, and 331 rural delivery stations. 19,328 old midwives were transformed. There are also 265 health stations, 41 first-aid stations, and 22 hospitals in factories and mines.
    Due to the development of the economy and culture, and the extensive and in-depth publicity and education to the masses of the people, especially the great victory and heroic behavior of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, the people of Northeast China have been greatly encouraged, and the political enthusiasm of people from all walks of life has been enhanced. They actively participated in the volunteer action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend their country and enthusiastically supported the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. This movement, which integrates patriotism and the internationalist spirit of defending world peace, is developing with overwhelming momentum throughout Northeast China.
    When the people of Northeast China were making every effort to carry out economic construction, counter-revolutionaries dispatched by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang carried out various kinds of sabotage. In response to this situation, we adopted the policy of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, severely suppressing resolute counter-revolutionary elements, but leniently dealing with certain elements with lighter crimes and who were willing to repent and rehabilitate themselves. As a result, society was stable, bandits disappeared, the people were happy, and production was active.
    Comrades! The development of economic and cultural construction in Northeast China in 1950 was quite rapid. This was mainly due to the hard work of the workers, peasants, and all the people, the active work of cadres at all levels, the help of Soviet experts, and especially the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. In addition, in the past year, our industrial construction was mainly in the process of recovery, so there were fewer difficulties, and the bumper harvest of agriculture was also an objective and favorable condition.
            (II)
    As we enter 1951, the aggression of U.S. imperialism against our great motherland is still continuing, and Northeast China is still in the forefront of national defense. In order to protect our homes and defend our country, the great action of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is developing victoriously. Therefore, the task of the Northeast People's Government and the people of Northeast China in 1951 is to further build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, based on the work of last year. Because with a strong national defense force, we can protect the smooth development of the entire national economic construction, and only by developing production and building a strong economic force can we further improve the people's lives, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and make national defense construction have a reliable material foundation. Therefore, all our work must revolve around this central purpose.
    What are we going to do in 1951?
    First, and most importantly, we must further strengthen our national defense army, train new technical arms, strengthen our air defense and coastal defense, and systematically train public security armed forces and militia according to the plan of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and improve our logistics, military industry, and health construction to meet the needs of a modern national defense army. Do a good job in giving preferential treatment to military dependents to consolidate the troops.
    Second, in terms of industrial production and construction, according to the needs of national defense and economic construction and possible conditions, actively and step by step develop the manufacturing industry. This year, the total output value of the industrial department system will increase by 18% compared with last year, of which the total output value of means of production will account for 85.1%, and the production of means of livelihood will also be appropriately increased with the rise of the people's economic life to meet the needs of the people's lives.
    Third, in terms of agricultural production, this year, the output per hectare will be increased by 6% to 7%, and the total grain output will be required to reach 19 million tons. In order to meet industrial needs, the planting area of ​​special crops will be expanded this year: cotton will be expanded to 420,000 hectares, producing 90,000 tons of lint cotton, and various kinds of hemp will be expanded to 96,000 hectares, producing 65,000 tons of hemp.
    In 1951, the planting work of the West Manchuria afforestation and protection zone will begin, and 3 million cubic meters of timber will be harvested in a planned way. For the fundamental treatment project of the Liaohe River system, surveying and planning preparation will begin this year.
    Under the central task of developing urban and rural exchanges, the state commerce and cooperatives will increase the sales amount of trade within the region this year. State commerce will increase by 28% compared with last year, and cooperatives will increase by 27.5% compared with last year.
    Transportation, especially the railway department, must make the greatest efforts to complete the transportation plan proposed by the state. Roads should be repaired in a planned way according to the needs of national defense and economy, and telecommunications work should be improved.
    The finance in 1951 mainly strengthens and improves urban tax revenue from the development of the economy, expands the profits of state-owned enterprises from improving the operation and management of enterprises, and fairly and reasonably levies public grain to ensure national defense expenditures and investment in economic construction, as well as the funds for cultural, educational, health and other construction undertakings, and ensure the stability of prices.
    According to the above plan, the total output value of state-owned industries and crops in Northeast China in 1951 will increase by 13.8% compared with 1950.
    The above is a general overview of strengthening national defense economic construction in 1951 under the general goal of consolidating national defense.
            (III)
    What basic experiences have we gained from the work in 1950? What issues need attention in completing the tasks in 1951?
    First of all, all our work must revolve around one central purpose, that is, "building a strong national defense force and a strong economic force." The Chinese people have fully realized in the long-term anti-imperialist struggle that there is nothing without a strong national defense. When imperialism is still threatening us, the desire to "bury ourselves in construction" away from the needs of national defense has proven to be a completely unrealistic fantasy. Therefore, we must greatly strengthen our national defense, maintain a clear head in all our work, and fully develop national defense and economic strength with selfless hard work and courage, complete the national liberation, and be ready at any time to crush any provocations against our motherland by U.S. imperialist aggressors and their running dogs, and consolidate our great motherland. It must be understood that the stronger our national defense force is, the more guaranteed our economic construction achievements and the cause of peace that we are committed to striving for will be.
    Second, the experience of the work in 1950 proves that developing production is the key to doing all work well. As mentioned earlier, because we have fully developed industrial and agricultural production, the result is that the purchasing power of urban and rural people has greatly developed; the volume of commodity circulation has expanded; people's lives have improved; financial tax revenue has increased; culture and education have developed; the people's democratic dictatorship has become more consolidated; and the national defense force has become increasingly abundant and strong. Under the people's regime, as long as production develops, all work will be easy to handle. Therefore, further developing industrial and agricultural production in Northeast China in order to further strengthen our national defense force is the main task of all the people and the Northeast People's Government in 1951.
    Third, the experience in 1950 also proves that the distribution problem must be solved at the same time as developing production, otherwise, the entire economy cannot move forward smoothly. Our distribution work is carried out through the following three aspects:
    The first is state commerce: mainly to activate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad. In addition to doing a good job in foreign exports, we should mainly focus on vigorously researching and developing the inland market, expanding and accelerating commodity circulation, in order to promote the development of production.
    The second is cooperatives: we must implement the policy that grassroots cooperatives serve members and higher-level cooperatives serve lower-level cooperatives. The large number of supply and marketing cooperatives existing in rural Northeast China must serve the production and supply and marketing needs of the vast number of members. In addition to continuing to strive to solve the requirements of members for means of livelihood, the following tasks should be put on their agenda and gradually solved in a planned way, namely: (1) supplying members with means of production; (2) selling members' local products; (3) developing rural credit cooperative undertakings to meet farmers' requirements for expanded reproduction. At the same time, we should strive to improve the operation of cooperatives so that cooperatives can supply members with more, better, and cheaper means of production and means of livelihood more timely.
    The third is private commerce: according to the needs of commodity circulation, we must actively guide private merchants to participate in urban and rural trade under the unified plan of the state, help them solve difficulties, and overcome certain artificial obstacles in urban and rural exchanges, but we should strictly ban certain private merchants' illegal speculative activities.
    In order to do a good job in production and distribution, we also need to strengthen and improve our transportation work and strictly implement the transportation plan.
    Fourth, in order to make the work of production, distribution, financial revenue and expenditure, and national defense construction closely coordinated and move forward following a general goal, we must strengthen planning. Especially in economic construction. This year, the focus of the economic plan is on compiling five types of plans: industrial production and capital construction, material supply and storage, commodity circulation, transportation, and cash revenue and expenditure. The central key is to solve the problems of material balance, cash balance, and transportation coordination from the perspective of development, so as to make the entire economy more active and developed.
    Finally, in order to successfully complete the arduous and complex tasks we shoulder, we must continue to improve old cadres and train a large number of new cadres, especially economic construction cadres with scientific knowledge and management skills. We should conscientiously organize the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among all cadres, especially leading cadres, as well as carry out education on policies and work styles, and continuously improve the policy level and professional ability of cadres through the methods of criticism and self-criticism. Continue to overcome bureaucracy, commandism, and clericalism, cultivate the style of seeking truth from facts, contacting the masses, and conducting propaganda to the masses of the people at any time, and prevent the growth of any complacency, self-satisfaction, paralysis, or impetuous emotions. We also need to further consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship. In addition to continuing to improve the political consciousness of workers and peasants and improving their living conditions and health levels as much as possible, we should closely unite all anti-American and patriotic people and hold people's representative conferences that can truly solve problems instead of formalism. At the same time, we must always be vigilant and eliminate the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of Northeast China will surely victoriously complete the task of consolidating national defense and developing the economy.

　　巩固国防、发展经济
     ——二月二十七日在东北人民政府委员会第三次扩大会议上的报告（摘要）
    （东北人民政府主席高岗）
            （一）
    东北人民在伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的胜利斗争中，光荣地完成了一九五○年的经济建设计划。经过这一年的努力，使东北的经济建设获得很大的进展，国防力量也更加巩固了。
    一九五○年东北区公营工业及农作物的生产总值，比一九四九年提高了百分之七十一点七，其中工业提高百分之一百一十七点三，农业提高百分之四十四点一。一九五○年公营工业的生产总值，超过了原计划的百分之十。职工比一九四九年增加了百分之三十五点二。农业生产也超过了计划。全区总产量超过原计划的百分之六强。铁路运输超过了全年装车计划的百分之九点二。
    由于公营企业和农业的发展，以及公私兼顾、劳资两利政策的贯彻，东北私营工商业也有了显著的发展。以沈阳市为例，一九四九年十二月该市共有私营工业一万二千零七家，从业人员五万零四百十三人，到一九五○年十一月，户数增加了百分之三十点二，人员增加了百分之三十二点四。
    以上是一九五○年东北工农业生产发展的概貌。这个概貌说明了东北的工业水平比一九四九年又提高了一步。在工业生产方面，尤其着重了对生产资料生产的恢复与发展。一九五○年东北国营工业的生产总值中生产资料占百分之七十七，生活资料占百分之二十三。很显然的，为了加强我们的国防，为了扩大我们工业的基础，必须采取首先恢复和发展重工业的方针。
    当然，这并不是说我们就放松了对人民生活必需品的生产与供应。在这一年中，只就工业部所属工厂的纱布纸张等产量来看，与一九四九年比较，棉纱等于百分之二百五十点四，棉布等于百分之二百四十六点五，纸张等于百分之二百二十点五。同时国家商店供给人民必需品，超过一九四九年的百分之一百二十六。仅就纱布一项来说，一九四九年供给人民四百万匹（捆），一九五○年即供给了九百零二万匹（捆），一年之内增长了百分之一百二十五。为了便利商品流通，国营商店扩大到一千七百二十一个，比一九四九年增加了六百六十一个，合作社扩大到一万零三百三十五个，社员发展到一千零七十万人（第三季度数）。
    经济发展的结果，大大地开辟了财源，从而保证了财政收支的平衡，保证了国防费用与经济建设的投资。东北全区一九五○年的实际收入超过原计划百分之二十一点七。支出则实现了合理的紧缩与节约。
    经济的发展，不仅保证了国防建设的需要，而且使人民的生活得到了相当的改善。一九五○年东北工业部各工厂、矿场不仅增加了就业人员，而且增加了工资，增加了职工住宅及其他福利事业。就重工业部门说：每人平均工资由一九四九年十二月份的一百四十分，上升为一百五十七分，平均提高了百分之十二点五。整个工业部系统并为职工建筑了一百五十六万多平方公尺的宿舍（包括俱乐部及医院等），并适当地改善了劳动条件。农民生活的改善，尤为显著。一九五○年农民的购买力，约较上一年提高百分之三十三。如单从纱布说，一九四九年平均每十个人买一匹布，一九五○年则平均每四个半人就买一匹布了。因之，许多农民添车买马，修房盖屋，添衣换被，猪肥马壮，鸡鸭成群，生活一天比一天好起来。
    经济建设的成果，又给文化建设的发展打下了物质基础。全东北的小学生一九五○年发展到四百五十七万六千一百一十一人，中学生发展到十五万五千七百四十八人（上半年统计），大学生发展到一万七千九百七十八人。在教学质量上也有所提高。新发展工农速成中学七处，学生一千五百五十人。工农文化补习学校三处，学生三千三百十一人。受补习教育的职工约有三十六万人，长年参加业余文化学习的农民约有一百八十万人，一九五○年参加冬学的农民则达四百五十万人。另外，农民还自动兴办了村学二千六百七十三所，学生二十万六千余人。报纸、出版、广播、文艺、电影及其他群众文化事业方面，在密切结合当前中心任务下，均有新的发展和新的成就。
    在卫生事业方面，一九五○年已有二百七十三个县属卫生院或医院，九百二十三个区卫生所，二百四十一个妇婴保健站和三百三十一个农村接生站，改造旧产婆一万九千三百二十八人。工厂、矿场中还有二百六十五个卫生所、四十一个救急所和二十二个医院。
    由于经济、文化的发展，和对人民群众广泛深入的宣传教育，特别是中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线的伟大胜利和英勇行为，大大地鼓舞了东北人民，提高了各阶层人民的政治积极性。他们积极地参加抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动，热烈地支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军。这种爱国主义与保卫世界和平的国际主义精神融合在一起的运动，在东北全境正以排山倒海之势向前发展。
    当着东北人民全力进行经济建设时，美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮所派遣的反革命分子进行了各种各样的破坏。针对此种情况，我们采取了坚决镇压反革命的方针，对坚决反革命的分子给以严厉的镇压，但对某些罪恶较轻，并愿意改过自新的分子，则从宽处理。结果使社会安定，匪盗敛迹，人民高兴，生产积极。
    同志们！一九五○年东北经济、文化建设的发展是相当迅速的，这主要是由于工人农民和全体人民的辛勤努力，各级干部的积极工作，苏联专家的帮助，特别是毛主席和中央人民政府英明领导的结果。此外，在过去一年中，我们的工业建设主要地还是处在恢复过程中，所以遇到的困难较少，而农业的丰收，也是客观的有利条件。
            （二）
    当我们在进入一九五一年的时候，美帝国主义对我伟大祖国的侵略还在继续进行，东北仍然处在国防最前线的地位。为了保家卫国，中国人民与中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的伟大行动正在胜利发展中。因此，东北人民政府和东北人民一九五一年的任务，就是在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导之下，在去年工作的基础上，进一步建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量。因为有了强大的国防力量，才能保卫整个国民经济建设顺利的向前发展，同时也只有发展生产和建设强大经济力量。才能进一步改善人民生活，更加巩固人民民主专政，使国防建设有可靠的物质基础。因此，我们的一切工作都必须围绕这个中心的目的。
    我们在一九五一年将要作些什么呢？
    首先，而且最重要的是必须根据中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的计划，更加壮大我们的国防军，训练新的技术兵种，加强我们的空防与海防，有计划地训练公安武装及民兵，改进我们的后勤、军工、卫生的建设，以适合于现代化的国防军的需要。做好优待军属的工作，以巩固部队。
    其次，在工业生产和建设方面，根据国防与经济建设的需要与可能的条件，积极地有步骤地发展制造工业。今年工业部系统的生产总值将比去年提高百分之十八，其中生产资料的生产总值将占百分之八十五点一，生活资料的生产也将要随着人民经济生活的上升而适当地提高，以满足人民生活的需要。
    再次，在农业生产方面，今年每垧地要提高产量百分之六到七，粮食的总产量将要求达到一千九百万吨。为了适应工业需要，今年要扩大特种作物种植面积：棉花扩大到四十二万垧，产皮棉九万吨，各种麻扩大到九万六千垧，产麻六万五千吨。
    一九五一年要开始进行西满造林防护地带的种植工作，并有计划地采伐木材三百万立方公尺。对于辽河水系的治本工程，要在今年开始勘测工作和准备计划。
    国家商业与合作社在发展城乡交流的中心任务下，今年区内贸易卖钱额，国家商业要比去年提高百分之二十八，合作社要比去年提高百分之二十七点五。
    交通特别是铁路部门，必须以最大的努力完成国家所提出的运输计划。要根据国防与经济的需要有计划的整修公路，提高电讯工作。
    一九五一年的财政，主要是从发展经济中加强与改进城市的税收，从改善企业的经营管理中扩大公营企业的利润，以及公平合理地征收公粮，以保障国防费用与经济建设的投资、以及文教卫生等建设事业的经费，并保障物价的平稳。
    根据上述计划，一九五一年东北公营工业与农作物的生产总值，将比一九五○年提高百分之一十三点八。
    以上就是我们一九五一年在巩固国防的总目标下，加强国防经济建设的梗概。
            （三）
    从一九五○年的工作中，我们得到那些基本经验呢？在完成一九五一年的任务时需要注意那些问题呢？
    首先，我们一切工作必须围绕着一个中心目的，这就是“建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量”。中国人民在长期的反帝斗争中充分认识了：没有强大的国防就没有一切。当帝国主义还在威胁着我们的时候，那种离开国防需要“埋头建设”的愿望，事实证明是一种完全不合实际的空想。因之，我们必须大大地加强我们的国防，在一切工作中保持清醒的头脑，以忘我的勤劳和勇敢，充分发展国防与经济力量，完成全国解放，并随时准备粉碎美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗对我祖国的任何挑衅，巩固我们伟大的祖国。必须了解：我们的国防力量愈强大，我们的经济建设的成果，我们所致力争取的和平事业，才愈有保障。
    第二，一九五○年工作的经验证明了：发展生产乃是做好一切工作的关键。如前所述，由于我们全力发展了工业和农业生产，结果就是城乡人民的购买力大大地发展了；商品流通量扩大了；人民生活改善了；财政税收增加了；文化教育发展了；人民民主专政政权更加巩固了；国防力量日益充实与强大了。在人民的政权下面，只要生产发展了，一切工作就好办了。因之，进一步发展东北的工农业生产，以便更加壮大我们的国防力量，更是一九五一年东北全体人民与东北人民政府的主要任务。
    第三，一九五○年的经验还证明了，与发展生产同时必须解决分配问题，否则，整个的经济就不能顺利前进。我们的分配工作，是通过以下三个方面来进行的：
    首先是国家商业：主要是活跃城乡、内外的物资交流。除做好对外出口外，主要地应以大力研究与开发内地市场，扩大与加速商品流转，以推进生产的发展。
    其次是合作社：必须贯彻基层社为社员服务，上级社为下级社服务的方针。东北农村中大量存在着的供销合作社，必须为广大社员群众的生产与供销需要服务，除继续努力解决社员群众的生活资料的要求外，应即将下列任务，放在自己的日程上，并有计划地逐步地加以解决，即：（１）供给社员生产资料；（２）推销社员土产；（３）发展农村的信贷合作事业，以适应农民扩大再生产的要求。同时应努力改善合作社的经营，使合作社能够更及时地供应社员以更多更好的廉价的生产资料与生活资料。
    再次是私人商业：要根据商品流转的需要，在国家统一计划之下积极引导私商参加城乡贸易，帮助它们解决困难，克服城乡交流中的某些人为障碍，但对某些私商违法的投机倒把活动，则应严予取缔。
    为了搞好生产及分配工作，还需加强与改进我们的运输工作，严格执行运输计划。
    第四，为使生产、分配、财政收支以及国防建设的工作能够密切配合，并遵循着一个总的目标前进，必须加强计划性。特别是在经济建设方面。今年经济计划的重点在于编制工业生产与基本建设、物资供应与储备、商品流转、交通运输及现金收支等五种计划，中心关键是从发展观点中来解决物资平衡，现金平衡，运输配合等问题，以便使整个经济更加活跃与发展。
    最后，为着胜利完成我们所肩负着的繁重而复杂的任务，我们必须继续提高老干部与大量培养新干部，特别是培养具有科学知识与管理能力的经济建设干部。应认真地在全体干部特别是领导干部中组织马列主义、毛泽东思想的学习，以及进行政策与工作作风的教育，以批评和自我批评的方法，不断地提高干部的政策水平、业务能力。继续克服官僚主义、命令主义、事务主义，培养实事求是，联系群众和向人民群众随时进行宣传的作风，防止任何骄傲自满麻痹急躁情绪的滋长。我们还须要更加巩固我们人民民主专政的政权，除继续提高工人农民的政治觉悟与尽可能地改善其生活条件、增进其健康水平外；并应亲密团结一切反美爱国的人士，开好真正能解决问题的而不是形式主义的人民代表会议。同时要时刻警惕与肃清反革命分子的破坏。我们坚决相信，在毛主席的领导之下，东北人民一定能够胜利地完成巩固国防、发展经济的任务。
