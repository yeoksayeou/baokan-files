　　Response to Criticism of the Dance "Mugunghwa"

Editor:
　　I read Comrade Yi Guang's letter "The Dance 'Mugunghwa' Should Be Revised" in the 91st issue of People's Literature and Art. I think his opinion is very valuable. First of all, I should express my sincere gratitude to such a loyal audience who enthusiastically offers us advice.
　　Comrade Yi Guang said that the theme of "Mugunghwa" is good, but the method of expression is inappropriate, which is a completely correct criticism. At the beginning of the rehearsal of "Mugunghwa," the responsible comrades of our troupe had already felt that there was such a shortcoming and repeatedly suggested to me that I should revise it. However, at that time, due to my personal enthusiasm for resisting the US and aiding Korea, I only sought to have the work performed and did not go through careful consideration, thinking that letting the US military die under the feet of the Korean people at the end would always be exciting. Therefore, I did not fully consider its actual effect on the audience, and did not thoroughly revise it. As a result, both the dance movements and the music revealed insufficient fighting atmosphere and the shortcomings of inconsistency between form and content.
　　Comrade Yi Guang's opinion has given me a good education. I think that an artist cannot do his work well if he does not understand the needs of the masses and does not carefully consider the objective effects. After gaining this experience, I should be more strict with myself in order to serve the people more faithfully.

Gao Di'an

　　We agree with the opinions in Comrade Gao Di'an's reply. It should be explained that although we repeatedly gave him advice at the time, we failed to insist on a thorough revision. And during the performance, we thought that since there were two different opinions, we could let it be tested in front of the audience; this was also a good opportunity to train ourselves. This is where we considered it inappropriately.
　　The new dance art is still in its infancy, and the comrades engaged in this work are young and inexperienced. We are very grateful to the audience for their enthusiastic suggestions, and we hope to hear such valuable suggestions often in the future.

Central Academy of Drama Dance Troupe

Editor's Note: The author of "Mugunghwa," Gao Di'an, and the Central Academy of Drama Dance Troupe have both responded to the reader's criticism and made some self-criticism of the shortcomings in the expression form of the dance, which is very good. Some readers, after reading Comrade Yi Guang's letter, thought that the dance had erotic elements because some of the wording was not entirely appropriate. It should be stated that this is not in accordance with the facts.

### 对舞蹈《无穷花》批评的答复

专栏：读者来信

　　对舞蹈《无穷花》批评的答复编辑同志：
    在人民文艺第九十一期中，看到了易光同志所写的“舞蹈《无穷花》应加修改”一封来信。我认为他的意见非常宝贵。首先，我应该向这样热心给我们提意见的忠实的观众，表示真挚的感谢。
    易光同志说，《无穷花》的主题是很好的，但表现方法却不妥当，这是完全正确的批评。在《无穷花》排演之初，我团的负责同志已经感觉到存在着这样一个缺点，向我多次提出意见，让我修改。但当时由于我个人激荡着抗美援朝的热情，只求作品的能够演出，没有经过慎重的考虑，以为在结束时让美军死在朝鲜人民的脚底下，总是会使人兴奋的。因此没有充分考虑到它在观众中的实际效果，没有彻底修改。以致无论在舞蹈动作上或音乐上，都显露出斗争气氛不够，以及形式内容不统一的缺点。
    易光同志的这个意见对我个人进行了一次很好的教育。我以为一个艺术工作者，如果不了解群众的要求，不慎重地考虑客观的效果，那是无法搞好他的工作的。我获得了这次的经验后，应该更严格地来要求自己，以期更忠实地为人民服务。    高地安
    高地安同志这个复信，其中的意见我们是同意的。应当说明的是：当时我们虽然一再向他提出意见，但未能坚持彻底修改。而在演出时，我们又以为既然有两种不同的意见，可以让它在观众面前去受考验；这对于锻炼我们自己也是很好的机会。这是我们考虑不当的地方。
    新舞蹈艺术还在萌芽时期，从事这门工作的同志都年轻，没有经验。能够得到观众这样热心地提意见，我们是十分感谢的，对于这样的宝贵意见，希望以后时常听到。        中央戏剧学院舞蹈团
    编者按：《无穷花》作者高地安和中央戏剧学院舞蹈团对读者批评都作了答复，对这个舞蹈在表现形式上的缺点有所检讨，这是很好的。有些读者看了易光同志的来信以后，由于其中一些字句不完全恰当，以为这个舞蹈有色情成份。应该说明，这是不符合事实的。
