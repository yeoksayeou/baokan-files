　　Domestic "Si" Cotton Successfully Spun into 60-Count Yarn
　　The state-owned Qingdao No. 16 Cotton Textile Mill has successfully spun domestic "Si" cotton into 60-count yarn. The finished product is not only bright and white in color, but also has a strength comparable to that of yarn made from American cotton. The success of spinning "Si" cotton into 60-count yarn has corrected the erroneous belief held by some technicians in the mill that domestic cotton could not be used to spin high-grade fine yarn. At the same time, it proves that China's textile industry can completely break away from its dependence on imperialism and rely on its own efforts for raw materials in spinning high-grade cotton yarn. In the future, China's cotton production should continue to strive for research and improvement in cotton seeds, soil, and cotton cultivation to meet the needs of the people's motherland's industry.
　　Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant Sets Three New Records in a Row
　　After workers in the steelmaking department of the Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group and launched a production competition, they set three new production records between February 13th and March 3rd. The first was on February 13th, when the daily output was 3.5% higher than the highest daily output last year; on February 28th, a second new record was set with a figure 25% higher; and on March 3rd, another new record was set with a figure 27.5% higher. All the production raw materials used to create these records were domestic goods, which is also a different point from the record of achieving the highest output last year using some foreign raw materials. Now the workers are continuing to work hard to consolidate the achievements of the new records and create even newer records.

    国产斯字棉纺制六十支纱成功
    国营青岛第十六棉纺织厂用国产斯字棉纺制六十支纱已获成功。所出成品，不但色泽洁白有光，而且强力与美国棉所制相仿。斯字棉纺制六十支纱的成功，纠正了该厂部分技术人员认为国产棉花不能纺制高级细纱的错误心理。同时证明我国纺织工业，在纺制高级棉纱的原料上，是完全可以摆脱对帝国主义的依赖而自力更生的。今后我国棉花生产应在棉种、土壤、棉作上继续努力研究改进，以适合人民祖国的工业需要。
    唐山钢铁厂连创三次新纪录
    唐山钢铁厂炼钢部工友响应马恒昌小组的挑战展开生产竞赛后，从二月十三日到三月三日之间，创出了三次产量上的新纪录。第一次在二月十三日，日产量较去年最高日产量高过了百分之三点五；二月二十八日以高过百分二十五创第二次新纪录；到三月三日又创出高过百分之二十七点五的最新纪录。创造这些纪录所用的生产原料全系国货，这与去年采用部分外国原料达成最高产量的纪录也是一个不同之点。现在工友们正为巩固新纪录的成绩及创造更新纪录而继续努力。
