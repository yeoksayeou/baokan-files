　　Oppose the United States Using Japan for Aggression
　　Gao Ji　Chen Youwei
　　In the five and a half years since the United States occupied Japan, it has acted perversely, implementing a policy of turning Japan into a military base for attacking the Asian continent and the Soviet Union. Since the start of the Korean War, the United States has openly used the military bases it retained in Japan, revived Japan's military industry, and forced the Japanese people to serve its war of aggression, maximizing the role of Japanese military bases in the American war of aggression. Even the Japanese Yoshida government, a puppet of American imperialism, openly acknowledged in its diplomatic white paper entitled "The Korean War and Japan's Position," published on August 19th of last year, that Japan has become "one of the most important outposts of the so-called 'United Nations Forces' invading Korea." This perverse action by the United States in Japan completely violates the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation, which it signed to bring about Japan's unconditional surrender, and the common policies of the Allied nations during World War II towards Japan after its surrender. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, the people of all countries that fought against Japan in World War II, and all peace-loving people around the world.

　　    The United States Openly Uses Japanese Military Bases for Aggression
　　The United States has not only violated international agreements by retaining Japanese naval and air bases in Japan, but it has also continuously repaired and expanded them. The naval bases that have been retained, repaired, and expanded include Yokosuka, Sasebo, Kure, Maizuru, Tsuruga, and Kobe. In addition, it has secretly militarized Japan's former naval ports such as Ominato in Aomori, Niigata, Iki and Tsushima in the Korean Strait, and Kanda Port (northern Kyushu), newly opened during World War II. As for air bases, the United States had already repaired and expanded approximately 200 military airfields originally in Japan on Kyushu, Honshu, and Hokkaido before 1948, making them capable of accommodating giant bombers. In addition, more than sixteen giant air bases have been newly built in Miyagi (northeastern Honshu), Izumi (Kagoshima), Akita, Misawa (both in northern Honshu), Sapporo (Hokkaido), and Itazuke (Kyushu). These bases have become the nests of the American invading navy and the US Fifth Air Force since the outbreak of the Korean War. The headquarters of the US Fifth Air Force, which invades Korea, is located in Nagoya, and almost all American planes bombing peaceful towns in Korea take off from Japanese airfields. The US invading navy also uses Japanese naval bases as its home, transporting troops and war materials to Korea, and bombarding Korean coastal towns, participating in combat. Moreover, American planes taking off from Japan have also bombed Northeast China. The United States is not only openly using Japanese military bases to carry out aggression against Korea, but also threatening the peace and security of China and Asia.

　　    The United States also Wants to Turn Japan into its Arsenal
　　In the American aggression plan, Japan is not only a military base, but also the Far Eastern branch of its arsenal. The United States has retained Japan's military industry, and since the outbreak of the Korean War, it has revived these industries on a large scale, producing large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and various military supplies for the American forces invading Korea. According to materials published by the Yoshida government's Economic Stabilization Board, from the start of the Korean War to November 5th of last year, the total value of military supply contracts signed by the US military authorities and Japanese enterprises reached more than $139,677,000, of which the ordered goods were worth more than $87,300,000, and repairs, processing, transportation, construction, and other labor services were worth more than $52,300,000. In the first two and a half months of the Korean War, the military supplies provided by Japan to the so-called "United Nations Forces" included 7,000 trucks, 300,000 barrels of gasoline, 50,000 sets of tires and inner tubes, 2,000 tons of galvanized sheets, 6,000 tons of barbed wire, 25 million sacks, 15,000 tons of rails, 15,000 tons of steel plates, and 1.5 million dry batteries. As of February 11th of this year, the total value of military supply contracts had increased to $221,639,000. In addition, the United States also uses Japan's military industry to repair and produce weapons such as cannons and tanks for the American forces invading Korea. The Shitamaru-ko factory, formerly affiliated with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the Akabane factory of Japan Steel Works are already repairing tanks, cannons, anti-tank guns, and vehicles damaged in the Korean War for the US military. Ishikawajima Corporation is currently producing large quantities of tanks and armored vehicles. Shipyards in various coastal ports are repairing warships and ships for the US military. Four Japanese shipbuilding companies have accepted orders from the US Navy and have begun building fifty ships. The Uraga Dock Company, one of Japan's largest shipyards, has extended working hours and intensified labor in order to speed up production of US military orders, forcing workers to work seven days a week, twelve hours a day. According to a Kyodo News Agency report from New York on February 19th, napalm bombs, a weapon of terror used by the US Air Force against the peaceful people of Korea, have also begun to be manufactured in Japan. This crime of the United States illegally retaining and reviving Japan's military industry is not only for the purpose of invading Korea, but also part of a criminal plan to attack China and carry out armed intervention in other Asian countries. Warmonger MacArthur has designated a number of Japanese military enterprises to produce weapons and other war materials specifically for the Kuomintang remnant troops in Taiwan and the Bao Dai puppet army of American and French imperialism in Vietnam. According to a Kyodo News Agency report, the Nagoya branch of Japan's "Toyota Automatic Loom Works" has been successively handing over parts for guns, bombs, hand grenades, land mines, and aerial bombs manufactured by the factory to the Kuomintang bandit army. The "Hitachi Manufacturing Co." in Kobe has also begun to transport large-caliber field guns, aircraft parts, shooting equipment, and ammunition to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants in Taiwan. In order to provide large-scale and organized arms assistance to the Kuomintang bandits, a "Da Zhong" (transliteration) trading company has been specially established to be responsible for transporting weapons and war materials to Taiwan. As for the Japanese military enterprises designated to supply weapons and equipment to the Bao Dai puppet army, there are Nikken, Fuji Industries, and others. The US plan to turn Japan into the Far Eastern branch of its arsenal nakedly exposes its aggressive conspiracy to expand the war and dominate Asia.

　　    The United States Employs Japanese War Criminals for Aggression
　　Not only that, but the United States has also fully used Japanese ships and other equipment in its criminal undertaking of aggression against the peoples of China, Korea, and various Asian countries, and has forced Japanese technicians and laborers to serve it. According to the Japanese Merchant Marine Bureau's announcement in October of last year, since the Korean War, the number of Japanese ships requisitioned by MacArthur Headquarters has reached 248, with a total tonnage of one million tons. Under the direction of MacArthur, the Japanese puppet government recently re-commissioned twelve destroyers and eight hundred landing craft to transport supplies for the American forces invading Korea. As for the fact that the United States uses Japanese technicians and laborers in the Korean War, even American journalists do not conceal it. According to a report by Beach Conger, the Tokyo correspondent for the "Chicago Daily News": "Landing craft manned by Japanese helped transport the first American troops to Korea. In July (1950), the Japanese helped transport the entire 1st Cavalry Division to Pohang." And of the ships that participated in the Inchon landing operation in mid-September, "nineteen ships were manned entirely by Japanese." Japanese aviation technicians have also been requisitioned by the US military. Brigadier General Doolittle, commander of the US Far East Air Force Materiel Command, confessed that "two-thirds" of the "heavy maintenance and inspection work of the combat and transport aircraft" of the US forces invading Korea is done by so-called "Japanese non-military personnel," numbering as many as 15,000 people. In addition, the number of Japanese laborers serving the US forces invading Korea had reached 143,000 as of September 14th of last year.

　　Even more illegal is that the United States has openly employed heinous Japanese fascist war criminals in its acts of aggression against China, Korea, and Vietnam, and has made Japanese fascist veterans serve as cannon fodder for its aggression. In the battles in the Suwon and Seoul areas last year, Japanese fascist soldiers participated in combat in the US invading forces' units. In the Suwon area alone, 30 Japanese soldiers were identified as having been killed in action. Many of the Japanese officers participating in combat in the US troops were important war criminals in the Japanese war of aggression against China, including Major General Yamaoka Michitake, former chief of staff of the Japanese army in Taiyuan, Shanxi, Lieutenant General Doi Akio, commander of the Japanese Taiwan Army during the war, and Lieutenant Colonel Yamazaki, former chief of the China section of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. When the US fleet blockaded the Korean coast in September and October of last year, the US naval authorities invading Korea appointed former Japanese Navy Vice Admiral Maeda Minoru as an advisor. As for the crimes of the United States using Japanese war criminals to carry out aggression against China, in addition to the well-known fact of directing former Japanese North China Expeditionary Army Commander Ne Motobo and others to organize so-called "volunteer troops" to prevent our liberation of Taiwan, the Second Section (espionage agency) of MacArthur's Tokyo Headquarters, through former Japanese invading Chinese army Colonel Iwasaki and Japanese spies Kawamoto Yoshitaro, Kodama Yoshio, Takahara Akiyoshi, Kadoya Hiroshi, Nabeyama Sadachika, etc., also wooed traitors of the former Wang Jingwei era, such as Ren Yuandao, Chen Zhongfu, Wang Zihui, and Yang Zhonghua, to organize the so-called "Sino-Japanese Alliance," and under the guise of the so-called "Third Force," to carry out destructive activities against the new China. In October of last year, Willoughby, the head of MacArthur's Allied Intelligence Group, discussed with former Japanese Lieutenant General Sakurai the issue of using Japanese troops in any possible military action that the United States might take in the Far East or Southeast Asia. Sakurai and other former Japanese generals suggested establishing several strong "volunteer armies" in Japan, composed of former officers and soldiers with combat experience in China, Burma, and Indochina. Sakurai also pointed out in his proposal that these troops, after special training (including paratrooper training), could be used to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang once military action was taken against the People's Republic of China. In the US interventionist aggression plan in Vietnam, the so-called "volunteer army" was also organized by Japanese fascist soldiers. MacArthur directed Prince Cuong De, the pro-Japanese uncle of Bao Dai who had lived in Japan for 45 years, and former Japanese fascist army Lieutenant General Iwane to form the "Aid Vietnam Volunteer Army" and set up a headquarters for forming the army in Tokyo. At the same time, MacArthur telegraphed Lieutenant General Tsuchibashi, the former commander-in-chief of the Japanese occupation army in Vietnam in Saigon, ordering him to contact Bao Dai to discuss the organization of the Japanese "volunteer army." According to MacArthur's orders, the Japanese troops recruited to Vietnam were to undergo short-term training by American officers. These aggressive crimes committed by the United States against the peoples of various Asian countries make it clear that it has openly embarked on the old path of Japanese aggression against Asia, and has also made the peoples of various Asian countries further recognize its close blood ties with Japanese fascism. The peoples of various Asian countries who suffered from Japanese aggression during World War II cannot ignore this.

　　    The US-Japan Reactionaries' Illegal Agreement to Publicly Rearm Japan
　　Recently, after suffering a disastrous defeat in the Korean War, the United States has intensified its plan to use Japan to expand its aggression against the Chinese and Korean people and the peoples of various Asian countries. US President Truman's special representative, warmonger Dulles, was dispatched to Japan in late January to conduct more than ten days of conspiracy activities regarding the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan. In a statement issued on February 10th, the day before Dulles left Japan, he openly admitted that he had agreed with Japanese puppet government Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru to rearm Japan and make it an instrument of American aggression. In addition to rearming Japan, the illegal agreement between Dulles and Yoshida also included a "US-Japan military alliance," and based on this "alliance," US troops would continue to occupy Japan for a long time, and the production of Japan's military industry would be increased to restore it to its highest level during the last war. In fact, the US plan to massively arm Japan and drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for its aggression was already being secretly carried out last year, when the signs of defeat in the Korean War were exposed and manpower was depleted. According to a Kyodo News Agency report on October 19th of last year: The United States planned for "Japan to have an army of 700,000, a navy of 500,000 tons, and an air force of 1,000 aircraft." According to a TASS report from Tokyo: "Foreign sources in Tokyo said that MacArthur Headquarters gave the Japanese government a secret memorandum in mid-December last year (1950), signed by Whitney, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Headquarters, ordering the Japanese government to quickly begin establishing a Japanese army with one million troops, a navy with a total displacement of 500,000 tons, and an air force with 1,000 aircraft, and to strengthen food control and consolidate air defenses." At the same time, "the United States will control all important leadership positions in the new Japanese army. Light equipment will be funded by the Japanese government, and heavy equipment will be funded and supplied by the US government." This is the US plan to rearm Japan and revive the forces of Japanese fascist militarism. Undoubtedly, the purpose of this plan is for the United States to rely on the forces of Japanese fascist militarism to continue its aggression. At the same time, the United States wants to continue to occupy Japan under the form of a "US-Japan military alliance," turning Japan into a permanent military base and colony of the United States in the Far East. Obviously, the United States wants to rely on Japan to continue and expand its aggression, and at the same time wants to destroy the Japanese state and deepen the enslavement of the Japanese people.

　　    Opposing the US Arming of Japan is the Most Important Task for the Asian People to Defend Peace
　　This action by the United States in Japan is entirely a plan to further push Asia into the abyss of war. The forces of Japanese fascist militarism are the source of Japanese aggression, and also the source of war in the Far East and Asia. This is well known to the Chinese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people around the world. Therefore, the international agreements on policies toward Japan signed between the Allied countries during World War II and after the end of World War II clearly stipulated that the forces of Japanese fascist militarism should be eliminated, and Japan should be democratized and demilitarized to ensure that Japan no longer becomes a threat to peace in Asia and the world. The Potsdam Proclamation issued by the Allied countries in July 1945, urging Japan to surrender unconditionally, first pointed out: "The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated." The basic policy toward Japan after surrender, passed and announced by the Far Eastern Commission in June 1947, further stipulated: "Japan should be completely disarmed and demilitarized," "Industries that can rearm for war should be prohibited," "Japan must not have any army, navy, air force, secret police organization...". These solemn international agreements are the guarantees of peace achieved by the heroic battles of the Asian people, especially the people of China and the Soviet Union, with great sacrifices and costs during World War II. The United States has completely overturned these agreements, and in its bloody crimes of invading China's Taiwan, invading Korea, and armed intervention in Vietnam and the Philippines, it has openly used Japan's military bases and manpower and material resources, and has decided to rearm Japan and expand its aggression. This has made the peace in Asia, which has already been damaged by the US aggression against China and Korea, subject to further and more serious threats, and has allowed the war disaster of Japanese aggression to harm the Asian people again. Therefore, opposing the United States using Japan for aggression and stopping the United States from rearming Japan has become the most urgent and important task for the Asian people, including the Japanese people, in their struggle to defend peace.

　　    The US Criminal Plan is Bound to be Thoroughly Defeated
　　In the struggle to defend peace and stop the United States from expanding its aggression, the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea against US aggression and the Korean People's Army have achieved brilliant victories on the Korean battlefield, which will give the Asian people infinite encouragement. What is especially important is that the great and invincible Sino-Soviet alliance guarantees the inevitable victory of the Asian people's struggle. The purpose of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, as pointed out in the preamble of the treaty: is to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the resumption of aggression by Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in aggressive actions in any form." Article 1 of the treaty stipulates: "The two contracting parties guarantee to jointly do their utmost to take all necessary measures to prevent the resumption of aggression and the destruction of peace by Japan or any other country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in aggressive actions." This solemn alliance is the most important obstacle blocking the US criminal road, and it is also the source of endless strength for the Asian people and the world's peace-loving people to defeat the US criminal plan. The Chinese people are continuing to launch the great patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in order to oppose the US rearming of Japan, and have held demonstrations. Major General Kislenko, the Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, also strongly condemned the US crime of illegally arming Japan at the regular meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on February 14th, and declared: "The US government shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences of this violation." At the same time, the broad patriotic people of Japan have also expressed their firm opposition to the US conspiracy to drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for its aggression. Seventy democratic organizations, including the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Justice Faction of the Socialist Party, jointly resolved in mid-January to launch a nationwide signature campaign to oppose the US rearming of Japan, demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty, and organized the "Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Council." The Japanese Peace Protection Committee and major Japanese trade unions, including the All-Japan Industry-Specific Labor Union Council, have also firmly stated that they are determined to fight to the end to oppose rearmament. Even Dulles himself, the warmonger who is implementing the US criminal plan, had to admit to reporters in Canberra, the capital of Australia, on February 15th: "In Japan, I received thousands upon thousands of letters from individuals or groups... All these letters opposed rearmament." Not only that, but even within the Japanese ruling class, the US criminal plan has caused fear of war and hidden worries about Japan's future.

　　There are many insurmountable difficulties on the US criminal road of using Japan for aggression. As long as the Asian people, including the Japanese people, intensify their struggle, they will surely be able to completely defeat the US criminal plan and regain peace in Asia and the world.

　　反对美国利用日本进行侵略
    高集　陈有为
    美国占领日本五年半以来，倒行逆施，执行了变日本为进攻亚洲大陆和苏联的军事基地的政策。在侵朝战争开始后，美国更是公开地利用了在日本被它保留下来的军事基地，复活了日本的军事工业，并迫使日本人民为其侵略战争服务，尽量发挥了日本军事基地在美国侵略战争中的作用。甚至美帝国主义的傀儡日本吉田政府在去年八月十九日发表的题为《朝鲜战争与日本立场》的外交白皮书中，也公开承认了：日本已成为侵略朝鲜的所谓“联合国部队的一个最重要的前哨”。美国在日本的这种倒行逆施，完全违反了它所签署的促令日本无条件投降的波茨坦公告的条款，和二次大战期间的同盟国家对投降后日本的共同政策，是中国人民和第二次大战中一切对日作战国家的人民，和全世界爱好和平人民所绝对不能容忍的。
            美国公然利用日本军事基地进行侵略
    美国在日本不但违反国际协定保留了日本的海、空军基地，而且还不断地加以修理与扩充。海军基地被保留并修理与扩充了的有横须贺、佐世保、吴港、舞鹤、敦贺、神户等处，而且又把青森的大凑、新泻，朝鲜海峡的壹歧、对马以及二次大战中新辟的苅田港（九州北部）等日本前海军要港秘密地军事化。空军基地如九州、本州及北海道日本原有的约二百个军用机场，远在一九四八年以前，美国即加以修理扩充，已可容纳巨型的轰炸机；此外，又新建了宫城（本州东北部）、出水（鹿儿岛）、秋田、三泽（均在本州北部）、扎幌（北海道）、板付（九州）等十六个以上的巨型的空军基地。这些基地，在侵朝战争发生以后，已成为美国侵朝海军和美国第五航空队的巢穴。美国侵朝空军第五航空队的司令部就设在名古屋，所有轰炸朝鲜和平城镇的美国飞机，几乎全部都是从日本的机场起飞的。美国侵朝海军也是以日本的海军基地为家，运送军队与战争物资前往朝鲜，并轰击朝鲜的沿海城镇，参加作战。而且，从日本起飞的美国飞机，也已轰炸了我国的东北。美国利用日本军事基地不但公开进行了对朝鲜的侵略，而且也威胁着中国与亚洲的和平与安全。
            美国还要把日本变为它的兵工厂
    日本在美国的侵略计划上，还不仅是一个军事基地，而且也是它兵工厂的远东分厂。美国保留了日本的军事工业，并在侵朝战争发生后使这些工业大规模地复活起来，为侵朝美军生产大量的武器、弹药与各种军事物资。据吉田政府经济安定本部发表的材料，自侵朝战争开始至去年十一月五日止，美国军事当局与日本各企业签订的军需合同，总额即达一亿三千九百六十七万余美元，其中订购物资为八千七百三十万余美元，修理、加工、运输、建筑等劳务为五千二百三十万余美元。在侵朝战争初期的两个半月内，日本供应所谓“联合国部队”的军需物资中，包括卡车七千辆、汽油三十万桶、车轮内外胎五万付、镀锌板二千吨、带刺铁丝六千吨、麻袋二千五百万只、路轨一万五千吨、钢板一万五千吨、干电池一百五十万只。至今年二月十一日为止，军需合同的总额更增至二亿二千一百六十三万九千美元。此外，美国还利用日本的军事工业为侵朝美军修理和生产大炮、坦克等武器。前日本三菱重工业株式会社所属的下丸子工厂、与日本制钢会社的赤羽工厂等，已在为美军修理在侵朝战争中受创的坦克、大炮、反坦克枪与车辆。石川岛株式会社现正在生产大批的坦克车与装甲车。各沿海港口的修造船厂，正在为美军修理舰艇船舶。日本四家造船公司已接受美国海军部的订货，开始建造五十艘船只。日本最大的造船厂之一浦贺造船厂，为了加速生产美军的定货，延长了工作时间和加强了工作强度，强迫工人一周工作七天，每天工作十二小时。并据电通社二月十九日的纽约消息，美国空军对朝鲜和平人民使用的一种恐怖武器——凝结汽油弹也已开始在日本制造。美国非法保留并复活日本军火工业的这种罪行，不但是为了侵略朝鲜，而且也是进攻中国和对亚洲其他各国人民实行武装干涉的罪恶计划的一部分。战争贩子麦克阿瑟曾指定若干日本军火企业专为在台湾的国民党残匪军队和越南美法帝国主义的傀儡保大军队生产武器与其他战争物资。根据电通社的报道，日本“丰田自动织机制作所”名古屋分厂已陆续将该厂制造的枪支、炸弹、手榴弹、地雷和空中炸弹的零件交给国民党匪军。神户的“日立制作所”也已开始把大口径野炮、飞机零件、射击装备和弹药运交给台湾蒋军残匪。甚至为了大规模地、有组织地给国民党匪帮以武器援助，已经特别成立一个“大中”（译音）贸易公司，专门负责运送武器和战争物资到台湾。至于被指定供给保大傀儡军队以武器和装备的，则有日建、富士产业等日本军火企业。美国把日本变为其兵工厂远东分厂的计划，赤裸裸地暴露了它企图扩大战争、独霸亚洲的侵略阴谋。
            美国起用日本战犯进行侵略
    不仅如此，美国在其侵略中朝两国和亚洲各国人民的罪恶事业上，更充分地使用了日本的船舶和其他设备，并迫使日本的技术人员和劳工为其服务。据日本商船局于去年十月宣布，自朝鲜战争以后，被麦克阿瑟总部征用的日本船只，已达二百四十八艘，总吨数达一百万吨。日本傀儡政府最近并在麦克阿瑟的指使下，将十二艘驱逐舰与八百只登陆艇重行服役，为侵朝美军运送物资。至于美国在侵朝战争中使用日本技术人员和劳工的事实，连美国记者也不加隐讳。据《芝加哥每日新闻》驻东京记者比区的报道：“配备着日本人的那些登陆艇，曾帮同将第一批美军运送到朝鲜去。在七月间（一九五○年），日本人曾帮同将第一骑兵师全部人马运往浦项”。而在去年九月中旬参加仁川登陆战的舰艇，“有十九艘的船员全是日本人”。日本的航空技术人员也被美军所征用。美国远东空军器材部司令部杜亿尔准将曾供称：侵朝美军的“作战飞机与运输飞机的繁重的保养与检查工作”，有“三分之二”都是由为数达一万五千人的所谓“日本非军职人员”干的。此外，为美国侵朝军队服役的日本劳工，至去年九月十四日止，为数已达十四万三千人。
    更其非法的，是美国在对中国、朝鲜和越南的侵略行为中公然起用罪大恶极的日本法西斯战犯，并使日本法西斯旧军人充当其侵略炮灰。在去年水原、汉城等地区的战役中，美国侵略军的部队中就有日本法西斯军人参加作战。仅在水原地区查明被击毙的日本军人即有三十名。在美国部队中参加作战的日本军官，有不少是在日本侵华战争中的重要战犯，包括前驻山西太原日军参谋长山冈道武少将，战时日本台湾方面军司令土居明夫中将及前日本参谋本部中国部主任山崎中佐。去将九、十月间美国舰队封锁朝鲜海岸的时候，美国侵朝海军当局就曾聘任前日本海军中将前田实为顾问。至于美国利用日本战犯对中国进行侵略活动的罪行，除人所共知的指使前日本华北派遣军司令根本博等组织所谓“志愿军”以阻止我解放台湾外，并由麦克阿瑟东京总部的第二处（特务机关）通过前日本侵华军人岩崎大佐及日本特务川本芳太郎、儿玉誉志夫、高原逢吉、门屋博、锅山贞亲等拉拢原汪伪时代的大汉奸任援道、陈仲孚、王子惠、杨仲华等，组织所谓“中日同盟”，在所谓“第三势力”的幌子下，进行对新中国的破坏活动。去年十月，麦克阿瑟的盟总谍报组组长威洛贝，曾与前日本中将樱井商谈美国在远东或东南亚可能采取的任何军事行动中利用日本军队的问题。樱井和其他前日本将领建议在日本建立几支强有力的“志愿军”，由在中国、缅甸、和印度支那有作战经验的以前的干部和官兵组成。樱井并在建议中指出：这些军队在经过特殊训练（包括伞兵的训练）以后，一旦对中华人民共和国进行军事行动时，可以用来帮助蒋介石匪帮。在美国干涉越南的侵略计划中，也利用了以日本法西斯军人组织所谓“志愿军”的方式来进行。麦克阿瑟在去年即曾指使留日四十五年的亲日派越奸、保大叔父强诋亲王及前日本法西斯军人岩畔中将筹组“援越志愿军”，并在东京设立了组军总部。同时，麦克阿瑟并致电在西贡的前日本在越占领军总司令土桥中将，命令他与保大联络，商谈组织日本“志愿军”问题。并且按照麦克阿瑟的命令，被征募赴越的日军，都要由美国军官进行短期训练。美国对亚洲各国人民进行的这些侵略罪行，使人们清楚地看到，它已公然走上了日本侵略亚洲的老路，而且也使亚洲各国人民进一步认清了它与日本法西斯的亲密的血缘关系。在第二次大战期间身受过日本侵略的亚洲各国人民，对此是绝不能漠视的。
            美日反动派非法协议要公开重新武装日本
    最近，在侵朝战争中遭受了惨重失败之后，美国利用日本扩大其对中、朝人民和亚洲各国人民的侵略计划，进行得更为变本加厉了。美国总统杜鲁门的特别代表战争贩子杜勒斯，于今年一月下旬奉派赴日，进行了十多天关于缔结单独对日和约的阴谋活动。在二月十日，杜勒斯离日前一天所发表的声明中，他公开承认已与日本傀儡政府首相吉田茂协议重新武装日本，使之充当美国的侵略工具。杜勒斯与吉田的非法协议中，除了重新武装日本之外，还包括了一个“美日军事同盟”，并根据这一“同盟”使美军继续长期占领日本，以及提高日本军火工业的生产，使之恢复到上次大战时的最高水平。事实上，美国大规模武装日本，驱使日本人民充当其侵略炮灰的计划，在去年侵朝战争败象暴露而人力枯竭的情况下，即在秘密进行了。据去年十月十九日电通社的报道：美国计划“日本拥有陆军人数七十万，海军吨位五十万吨，空军飞机一千架。”又据塔斯社得自东京的消息：“在东京的外国人士说，麦克阿瑟总部在去年（一九五○）十二月中旬曾给日本政府一项有该总部民政局局长惠特尼签字的秘密备忘录，命令日本政府赶紧开始建立一支拥有一百万军队的日本陆军，总排水量达五十万吨的海军和拥有一千架飞机的空军，并加强粮食的管制和巩固空防”。同时，“美国将掌握日本新陆军中的一切重要的领导地位。轻装备由日本政府出资，重装备由美国政府出资供给”。这就是美国重新武装日本，并复活日本法西斯军国主义势力的计划，无疑的，美国这个计划的目的，是为了要依靠日本法西斯军国主义势力继续进行侵略的。同时，美国还要在“美日军事同盟”的形式下使美军继续占领日本，变日本为美国在远东的永久的军事基地与殖民地。显然的，美国是既要依靠日本继续与扩大侵略，而又要灭亡日本国家，加深对日本人民的奴役。
            反对美国武装日本是亚洲人民保卫和平的最重要任务
    美国在日本的这种作为，完全是要把亚洲进一步推入战争深渊的计划。日本的法西斯军国主义势力，是日本侵略的根源，也是远东和亚洲战祸的根源，这是中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所熟知的事情。所以，在第二次大战期和第二次大战胜利结束以后，同盟国家间所签订的关于对日政策的国际协定，都明确地规定了要消除日本的法西斯军国主义势力，促使日本民主化与非军国主义化，以保证日本不再成为亚洲与世界和平的威胁。一九四五年七月盟国促令日本无条件投降的波茨坦公告，首先即指出：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之职权及势力，必须永久剔除”。一九四七年六月远东委员会通过公布的对投降后日本之基本政策中，更规定了：“日本应完全解除武装与军备”，“凡足以重整军备以作战之工业则应予禁止”，“日本不得再有任何陆军、海军、空军、秘密警察组织……”。这些庄严的国际协定，是第二次大战期间亚洲人民，尤其是中、苏两国人民英勇作战，以极大的牺牲与代价所取得的和平保障。而美国则完全推翻了这些协定，在侵略中国的台湾、侵略朝鲜、武装干涉越南、菲律宾的血腥罪行中，公开地利用了日本的军事基地与人力物力，并决意重新武装日本，扩大侵略。这就使得已因美国侵略中、朝而被破坏了的亚洲和平，受到更进一步与更严重的威胁，使日本侵略的战争灾难再度危害亚洲人民。因此，反对美国利用日本进行侵略，制止美国重新武装日本，就成为亚洲人民，也包括日本人民在内的保卫和平斗争的最迫切、最重要任务了。
            美国的罪恶计划是必然能够彻底击败的
    在保卫和平、制止美国扩大侵略的斗争中，中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上已取得了辉煌的胜利，这将给亚洲人民以无限的鼓舞。尤其重要的，是伟大无敌的中苏同盟保证着亚洲人民斗争的必然胜利。中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结的目的，如条约序文中所指出的：是“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家重新侵略”。条约的第一条并规定了：“缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平”。这个庄严的同盟，是横阻在美国罪恶道路上的最重大障碍，也是亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民击败美国罪恶计划的无穷尽的力量的源泉。中国人民为反对美国重新武装日本，正在继续展开抗美援朝的伟大爱国运动，并纷纷举行了示威游行。苏联驻盟国对日委员会的代表基斯连科少将亦已于二月十四日的盟国对日委员会的定期会议上，严词指责了美国非法武装日本的罪行，并声明：“美国政府对这种违反行为的一切后果应负全部责任。”同时，日本广大的爱国人民，对于美国阴谋驱使日本人民充当其侵略炮灰的罪恶计划，也表示坚决反对。日本共产党、劳农党、社会党正义派等七十个民主团体，已于一月中旬联合决议，展开全国规模的签名运动，反对美国重新武装日本、要求缔结全面和约，并组织了“全面媾和爱国协议会”。日本拥护和平委员会以及包括全日产业别劳働组合协议会在内的日本各大工会，也都坚决表示，誓为反对重新武装斗争到底。甚至执行美国罪恶计划的战争贩子杜勒斯本人，二月十五日在澳大利亚首都堪培拉对记者发表谈话时，也不得不承认：“在日本，我接到成千成万的个人或团体的信件………所有这些信都反对重新武装”。不仅如此，就是在日本统治阶级内部也由于美国罪恶计划而造成了对战争的恐惧，与对日本前途的隐忧。
    在美国利用日本进行侵略的罪恶道路上，是存在着重重不可克服的困难的，只要亚洲人民，包括日本人民在内加紧斗争，是必然能够彻底击败美国的罪恶计划，并重获亚洲与全世界的和平的。
