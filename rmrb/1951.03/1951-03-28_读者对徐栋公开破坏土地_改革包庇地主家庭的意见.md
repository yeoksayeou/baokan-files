　　Readers' Opinions on Xu Dong's Open Sabotage of Land Reform and Shielding of Landlord Families
　　Firmly Stand on the Party's Position and Support Farmers' Land Reform
　　Editor:
　　I am a young worker who voluntarily joined a military cadre school in order to resist American imperialist aggression and protect our hard-won achievements and happy life. When I saw the report in the newspaper about Xu Dong shielding a landlord family, I was extremely angry. I have a few opinions on this matter:
　　Xu Dong's behavior of shielding a landlord family thoroughly exposed his landlord class stance. Although Xu Dong has been a member of the Party for over ten years, when the interests of the people contradicted his personal interests, he abandoned the interests of the people and resolutely stood on the side of the landlords to sabotage land reform. This matter should serve as a warning to Party members, members of the Youth League, and government cadres who come from landlord backgrounds. In the vigorous land reform movement, they must stand firm in their positions, enthusiastically support the just actions of the peasants, and never, like Xu Dong, oppose the peasants' land reform for the sake of their landlord families and relatives. At the same time, I hope that all government organs, factories, and schools will use the article reporting Xu Dong's shielding of a landlord family as study material to raise everyone's awareness.
　　I fully agree with the decision of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to expel Xu Dong from the Party and the suggestion to remove him from his administrative post. I hope the people's court's punishment of Xu Dong will be published in the newspaper. The people's government should severely punish the heinous tyrant landlord Xu Juchu.
　　Finally, I have a suggestion for the Wuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuxi County People's Government. They should conduct a self-criticism among the masses regarding their lack of principle in handling the tyrant landlord Xu Juchu. I also hope that the results of the self-criticism will be published in the newspaper to attract the attention of other local workers.

　　The Wuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuxi County People's Government Should Conduct a Public Self-Criticism
　　Editor:
　　I was outraged to see the serious incident of Xu Dong shielding a landlord family in the Party Life column on March 16. This fact fully demonstrates that Xu Dong has completely become a brutal counter-revolutionary element. On the other hand, it shows that the Wuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuxi County People's Government still lack a firm grasp of principles in some areas of the peasant land reform movement. First of all, the Wuxi County People's Government should not have solicited Xu Dong's opinion on the tyrant landlord Xu Juchu. People like Xu Dong have no right to express opinions on how to deal with Xu Juchu. The Wuxi County People's Government's failure to consult the masses and instead solicit Xu Dong's opinion is wrong; it is a manifestation of irresponsibility towards the people. Secondly, the Wuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuxi County People's Government did not criticize or stop Xu Dong's behavior of shielding a landlord family, but instead allowed him to casually take the prisoner Xu Juchu out of the people's government prison and sit in the Wuxi County Committee's reception room to talk. One can imagine the bad influence this would have on the masses. Finally, the Wuxi County People's Government held a mass meeting with Xu Dong's participation without sufficient preparation, which resulted in counter-revolutionary elements taking the opportunity to attack the masses, greatly affecting the masses' fighting spirit. Therefore, I believe that the Wuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuxi County People's Government should make a public self-criticism to the masses and conduct extensive policy education among the masses to further enhance the people's understanding of our Party and the People's Government's attitude towards peasant land reform.

　　Communist Party Members from Landlord Class Backgrounds Must Thoroughly Betray the Landlord Class
　　Editor:
　　Xu Dong, as a Communist Party member, in the land reform movement, brazenly stood on the landlord class position, opposed the people, and attacked the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, in order to sabotage land reform and shield his father, whose hands were stained with the blood of the people. This is not allowed by Party discipline. Therefore, I 100% support the decision of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to expel Xu Dong from the Party and recommend that the court punish him according to law.
　　In addition, I feel that Communist Party members from landlord class backgrounds should all learn a lesson from the Xu Dong incident of shielding a landlord family, thoroughly betray the landlord class, and become outstanding Communist Party members.

　　Land Reform Does Not Allow Sabotage
　　Editor:
　　I am from Jiangnan and come from a landlord family. After studying the land reform policy, I realized that the feudal ruling class has ruled China for thousands of years, and the sins of exploiting and oppressing the peasants are endless. We must carry out land reform to completely destroy this feudal system and put the country on the road to industrialization. Land reform is indeed a major event in Chinese history and does not allow anyone to sabotage it. When I saw in the newspaper that Xu Dong shielded a landlord family and sabotaged land reform, I was very angry. I believe that expelling these people from the Party and handing them over to the court for punishment is correct. At the same time, I hope that all government organs and schools will strengthen the education of cadres and students, especially those from landlord backgrounds, on the land reform policy to raise their ideological awareness and become loyal servants of the working people.

### 读者对徐栋公开破坏土地  改革包庇地主家庭的意见

　　读者对徐栋公开破坏土地
    改革包庇地主家庭的意见
    坚决站在党的立场支持农民土地改革编辑同志：
    我是一个青年工人，为了反抗美帝国主义的侵略，保护我们已得的胜利果实和幸福生活，自愿地参加了军事干部学校。当我在报上看见徐栋包庇地主家庭的报道时，气愤极了，我对这件事提出几点意见：
    徐栋包庇地主家庭的行为，彻底地暴露了他的地主阶级立场。徐栋虽然入党十多年了，但当人民利益与他个人利益矛盾的时候，就抛弃了人民的利益，坚决地站到地主方面去破坏土地改革。这件事十分值得引起地主出身的党员、团员与人民政府干部的警惕，在轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动中，一定要站稳自己的立场，热情地支持农民的正义行动，决不要像徐栋一样的为自己的地主家庭与亲友，而去反对农民的土地改革。同时，我希望各机关、工厂、学校，把报道徐栋包庇地主家庭的文章，作为学习材料，以提高大家的觉悟。
    我完全同意中共南京市委员会开除徐栋党籍的决定和建议行政上撤职的处理。人民法院对徐栋怎样制裁的，希望在报纸上公布出来。对于恶贯满盈的恶霸地主徐菊初，人民政府应该严格制裁。
    最后我对中共无锡县委员会与无锡县人民政府提一点意见，他们应当在群众中检讨在处理恶霸地主徐菊初过程中无原则的地方。检讨结果也希望在报纸上公布，以引起其他地方工作人员的注意。

    中共无锡县委会无锡县人民政府应进行公开检讨编辑同志：
    我在三月十六日的党的生活栏内，看到徐栋包庇地主家庭的严重事件，不胜愤慨。这事实当然充分地说明徐栋完全成为一个残暴的反革命分子；另一方面，说明了中共无锡县委员会与无锡县人民政府，在农民的土地改革运动中，有些地方掌握原则还不够。首先无锡县人民政府不应该向徐栋征求恶霸地主徐菊初的意见。像徐栋这样的人，根本无权利来发表对徐菊初处理的意见。无锡县人民政府不征求群众，而征求徐栋意见，这是错误的，这是对人民不负责任的表现。其次中共无锡县委员会与无锡县人民政府对徐栋包庇地主家庭的行为，不批评和制止，反而允许他从人民政府的监狱里把犯人徐菊初随便提出来，并坐到无锡县委会的会客室里谈话。在群众中留下什么样的坏影响，是可以想像到的。最后无锡县人民政府在没有充分准备前，就召开有徐栋参加的群众大会，结果使反革命分子乘机打击群众，大大影响了群众斗争情绪。所以我觉得中共无锡县委员会与无锡县人民政府应该公开向群众作检讨，并要向群众广泛进行政策教育，使得人民群众进一步认识我党与人民政府，对农民土地改革的态度。

    地主阶级出身的共产党员要彻底叛变地主阶级编辑同志：
    徐栋身为共产党员，在土地改革运动中，竟肆无忌惮地站到地主阶级立场上，反对人民，打击党与人民政府的威信，以达到破坏土地改革，包庇他的双手沾满人民鲜血的父亲的目的。这是党的纪律所不允许的。所以我百分之百的拥护中共南京市委会开除徐栋党籍，并建议法院依法惩办的处理。
    另外我觉得地主阶级出身的共产党员，都应该从徐栋包庇地主家庭事件中得到教训，要彻底叛变地主阶级，做一个优秀的共产党员。
                                                刘永年
   土地改革不容许破坏编辑同志：
    我是江南人，家庭也是地主成份。学习过土地改革政策以后，使我认识到，封建统治阶级统治中国已几千年了，剥削压榨农民的罪恶是说不尽的。我们必须进行土地改革，才能彻底摧毁这种封建制度，使国家走上工业化的道路。土地改革确实是中国历史上一件大事情，不容许任何人来破坏。当我在报上看到徐栋包庇地主家庭，破坏土地改革后，非常气愤。我认为开除这些人的党籍并交法院惩办是正确的。同时我希望各机关、学校都要对干部学生，特别是对地主出身的干部、学生，更应该加强土地改革政策的教育，提高这些人的思想觉悟，做一个劳动人民忠实的勤务员。
