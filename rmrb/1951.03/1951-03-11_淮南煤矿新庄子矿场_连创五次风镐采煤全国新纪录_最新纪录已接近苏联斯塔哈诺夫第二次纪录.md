Huainan Coal Mine Xinzhuangzi Mine
Achieves Five Consecutive National Records in Pneumatic Pick Coal Mining
Latest Record Approaches the Second Record of Soviet Stakhanov

    Inspired by the victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front, the workers of the Xinzhuangzi Mine in Huainan Coal Mine threw themselves into production with a fighting spirit. From February 17th to 25th, they successively set five new national records in pneumatic pick coal mining.

    On February 16th, upon hearing the news of the victory on the Korean front, where over 20,000 enemies were annihilated, the miners of Xinzhuangzi Mine resolved to greet and celebrate this great victory of the Chinese and Korean people with new production records. Labor model Zhang Yutang, who had previously set five new records, with the cooperative efforts of his group (six carpenters and four coal pushers), advanced 1.35 meters on a working face of 38.7 meters long and 2.4 meters thick in an actual working time of 5 hours and 39 minutes, setting the first record with 163 tons of coal mined by pneumatic pick. This record exceeded the previous national record of 146 tons set by Feng Xuran (a national labor model representative), a famous pneumatic pick operator from the Datong Coal Mine under the same mining administration, on the last day of the previous year, by 17 tons. News of the achievement spread quickly, arousing the production enthusiasm of all the miners. That same evening, the pneumatic pick operator Gao Jiyun, with the cooperation of his eleven workmates, used seven hours of actual working time to advance 1.68 meters on a working face 35 meters long and 2.39 meters thick, creating a new record with 186.867 tons of coal mined. The next day, during the middle shift, the group of pneumatic pick operator Su Huiyu used 6 hours and 36 minutes of actual working time to advance 1.53 meters on a working face 37 meters long and 2.5 meters thick, with a production of 184 tons, approaching the previous new record. Immediately after, the group of pneumatic pick operator Li Daoping, during the evening shift, used the same amount of time to advance 1.57 meters on a working face 39.8 meters long and 2.5 meters thick, setting another new record with a production of 203 tons. On the afternoon of the 24th, when the miners of the middle shift heard that Song Zichun, Deputy Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, had come to the Huainan Mining Bureau to inspect work and had already arrived at Jiulonggang (one of the three coal mines under the Huainan Coal Mine), their enthusiasm was exceptionally high. They proposed: "Let's set another new record to welcome Deputy Director Song to Xinzhuangzi Mine to guide our work." On a working face 39.36 meters long and 2.5 meters thick, pneumatic pick operator Wang Hongsheng and his entire group of workers used 5 hours and 45 minutes of actual working time to advance 1.65 meters, breaking the previous three new records with a new record of 211.08 tons of coal mined. By the 25th, the group of night shift pneumatic pick operator Chen Yuhua, with 4 hours and 45 minutes of actual working time, advanced 1.68 meters on a working face 39.45 meters long and 2.5 meters thick, finally achieving the fifth highest record in a week at Xinzhuangzi Mine with a coal output of 215.12 tons. This record is approaching the second record of 227 tons created by Soviet Stakhanov in his coal mining history (the first record was 102 tons).

    Now, every pneumatic pick operator at Xinzhuangzi Mine can exceed the record of 160 tons of coal mined using a pneumatic pick. The new record movement in the mine is still in full swing. The leadership has grasped everyone's enthusiasm and is conducting education within the Party and Youth League branches and trade union groups to consolidate the achievements of the records and put forward the slogan "Everyone innovate, everyone create," encouraging all miners to strive for even newer records by improving operating methods and rationally organizing labor.

　　淮南煤矿新庄子矿场
    连创五次风镐采煤全国新纪录 
    最新纪录已接近苏联斯塔哈诺夫第二次纪录
    为中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军在朝鲜前线的胜利所鼓舞，淮南煤矿新庄子矿场工人以战斗姿态投入生产，从二月十七日到二十五日之间，连续创出了五次风镐采煤的全国新纪录。
    二月十六日，当听到了朝鲜前线歼敌二万余人的捷报后，新庄子矿场矿工就决心以生产上的新纪录来迎接和庆祝这个中朝人民的大胜利。曾创五次新纪录的劳动模范张玉堂在其小组（六个木工、四个推煤工）的努力合作下，于十七日以实际工作五小时三十九分的时间，在工作面长三十八米七、煤层厚两米四的掌子面上前进一米三五，以风镐采煤一百六十三吨首创纪录。这个纪录比之该矿所属大通煤矿著名风镐手鄷绪然（全国劳动模范代表）在去年大除夕以一百四十六吨产量所创全国最高纪录，超过了十七吨，表扬快报到处飞扬，激起了全矿工人的生产热情。当天晚班风镐手高继云配合全组工友十一人，用七小时的实际工作时间，在工作面长三十五米、煤层厚二米三十九的掌子面上前进一米六八，以一百八十六点八六七吨采煤量创出了更新纪录。次日中班风镐手粟会余的小组用了六小时三十六分的实际工作时间，在工作面长三十七米、煤层厚二米五的掌子面上推进一米五三，产量一百八十四吨接近前项新纪录。紧接着，晚班风镐手李道平的小组用相等的时间在工作面长三十九米八、煤层厚二米五的掌子面上进展一米五七，以二百零三吨的产量再创新纪录。二十四日中午，中班矿工听到中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局副局长宋子春来淮南矿务局检查工作，并且已到九龙岗（淮南煤矿所属三个煤矿之一）的消息时，情绪格外热烈，提出：“再创一个新纪录来欢迎宋副局长到新庄子矿场指导工作”。在工作面长三十九米三六、煤层厚二米五的掌子面上，风镐手王鸿声及其小组全体工友用五小时四十五分的实际工作时间前进一米六五，以采煤二百十一点零八吨的最新纪录打破了前三次新纪录。到二十五日，夜班风镐手陈玉华小组又以四小时四十五分的实际工作时间，在工作面长三十九米四五、煤层厚二米五的掌子面上前进一米六八，终于以二百十五吨一二的采煤量在新庄子矿场出现了一周来第五次的最高纪录。此项纪录已经接近苏联斯塔哈诺夫在其采煤历史上所创第二次二百二十七吨的纪录（第一次为一百零二吨）。
    现在，新庄子矿场的每个风镐手，用风镐采煤都能超过一百六十吨的纪录了。该矿新纪录运动还正在轰轰烈烈地展开，领导上掌握住大家的热情，分别在党、团支部内及工会小组内进行教育，以求巩固纪录的成绩，并提出“人人创新，大家创新”的口号，鼓励全体矿工在改进操作方法和合理组织劳动的条件下，创造更新纪录而努力。
