　　Fengfeng Coal Mine Reports Victory to Chairman Mao
    Pneumatic Drill Coal Production Sets New National Record
    243 Tons of Coal Produced in Seven Hours and Twenty Minutes
    [This newspaper’s dispatch] To report to Chairman Mao, the Fengfeng Coal Mine’s Tongshun Well No. 506 renovated worksite, after adopting the descending layered caving method introduced by Soviet experts, pneumatic drill operator Zhao Wenxin created a new national record of 243 tons of coal mined in seven hours and twenty minutes during the night shift on March 19, 1951. The director and deputy director of the mine management bureau sent a special telegram to Chen Yu, Minister of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, to forward it to Chairman Mao to report the victory. The telegram stated:
    “In order to resist America and aid Korea, and to welcome the National Coal Mine Conference in April, the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine has been launching a vibrant movement to create new records in pneumatic drill coal mining since March 9th. On the 16th, Shen Wenyuan of Mine No. 1 (Tongshun Well) first created a record of 114 tons, on the 17th, Ma Jinyu of Mine No. 2 (Taian Pit) created a record of 135 tons, on the 18th, Yang Ercheng of Mine No. 1 created a record of 151 tons, on the 19th, Zhang Jinshan of Mine No. 1 created a record of 161 tons, and on the same day during the night shift, Zhao Wenxin created a highest record of 243 tons in seven hours and twenty minutes. The movement is advancing.”
    In the enlarged joint conference of the heads of coal mining bureaus in North and East China during the first quarter of this year, it was decided that Fengfeng and Huainan mines would both be key areas for promoting new coal mining methods. After the meeting, Liu Xiangsan, Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, went to Fengfeng, and Song Zhichun, Deputy Director, went to Huainan to supervise the work at any time. Huainan Coal Mine has developed from the new national record of 146 tons created by Feng Xuran on New Year's Eve in 1950 to 203 tons, and then to 215 tons. Fengfeng Mine, not wanting to fall behind, began a record-breaking movement on March 9. In a slightly inclined coal seam with a thickness of 4.9 meters, the upper layer is mined by retreat mining. It has now surpassed Huainan Coal Mine and created the latest national record. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry was very excited to receive this news while preparing to convene a national coal mine conference, and sent a special telegram to the mine to congratulate it, and encouraged all employees of the mine to work hard to consolidate and promote this glorious achievement.
    Another major gain of the mine is that the increased speed of advancement has ensured the safety of the roof, and due to the reform of production methods, the consumption of pit timber has also been greatly saved, and is currently 72.2 percent less than originally planned, which is very closely related to reducing costs.

    [Editor's Note] "Descending caving layered mining method" is a coal mining method that divides thick coal seams (coal seams with a thickness of more than 3.5 meters) into thin layers and mines them layer by layer from top to bottom, allowing the roof to collapse naturally. "Pneumatic drill" is a coal mining tool that uses compressed air as its power source. "Pneumatic drill operator" refers to people who use pneumatic drills in underground coal mining operations.

　　峰峰煤矿向毛主席报捷
    风镐采煤量创全国最新纪录 
    七小时二十分产煤二四三吨
    【本报讯】国营峰峰煤矿通顺井第五○六号改造场子，采用苏联专家所介绍的下行分层陷落法后，风镐手赵文信于一九五一年三月十九日夜班以七小时二十分创造了采煤二四三吨的全国最新纪录。该矿管理局局长、副局长特电中央燃料工业部陈郁部长转呈毛主席报捷。电文称：
    “国营峰峰煤矿为抗美援朝及迎接四月全国煤矿会议，自三月九日开始，如火如荼地开展风镐采煤创新纪录运动。十六日一矿（通顺井）申文远首创一一四吨的纪录，十七日二矿（太安坑）马金玉创一三五吨的纪录，十八日一矿杨二成创一五一吨的纪录，十九日一矿张金山创一六一吨的纪录，同日晚班赵文信以七小时二十分创二四三吨的最高纪录。运动正前进中。”
    在今年第一季华北、华东各煤矿局长扩大联席会议中，决定了峰峰和淮南两矿都作为推行新采煤方法的重点区。会后，煤矿管理总局刘向三局长即去峰峰，宋之春副局长去淮南，随时督导工作。淮南煤矿已由一九五○年除夕酆绪然创造的全国新纪录一四六吨发展到二○三吨，再进到二一五吨。峰峰矿不甘落后，于三月九日开始开展创新纪录运动，在厚四·九公尺微倾斜的煤层中，回采上分层。现已超过淮南煤矿，创造了全国最新纪录。中央燃料工业部正在筹备召开全国煤矿会议期间，得到这一消息，非常兴奋，特电该矿致贺，并鼓励该矿全体职工为巩固与推广这一光荣成果而努力。
    该矿的另一重大收获是由于前进的速度加快，保证了顶板的安全，而因生产方法的改革，坑木消耗也大大节省，目前已较原计划减少了百分之七二·二，这对于降低成本是有着非常密切关系的。（燃料工业部通讯组）
    【编者注】“下行陷落分层采煤法”，即将厚煤层（厚度在三·五公尺以上的煤层）分成薄层，自上而下依层开采之，而使顶板自然陷落的采煤方法。“风镐”，是以压缩空气为原动力的一种采煤工具。“风镐手”，即井下采煤工作中使用风镐的人。
