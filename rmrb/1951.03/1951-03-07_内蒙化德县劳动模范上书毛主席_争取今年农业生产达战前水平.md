Labor Models of Huade County, Inner Mongolia, Petition Chairman Mao

Strive for This Year's Agricultural Production to Reach Pre-War Levels

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are the entire body of labor models from the Third Labor Model Congress of Huade County, Chahar League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. We are writing to report to you our production achievements in 1950 and our production plan for 1951. In 1950, under the wise leadership of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and your wise leadership, the grain we harvested in the county was 50 percent more than in 1949 (some villages only achieved 70 percent of their normal harvest due to natural disasters and pests; some villages have approached pre-war production levels). The food supply for the county's farmers is now able to meet their own needs. Animal husbandry in 1950 also increased compared to 1949. Among them, cattle increased by 20 percent, sheep increased by 37 percent, and pigs increased by 20 percent. In 1950, we planted a total of 200,000 trees, with a survival rate of 70 percent.

Respected Chairman Mao, the people of our country are carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. In order to increase the strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of Huade County have decided to work even harder to produce, and strive to bring the county's agricultural production to pre-war levels in 1951. We wish you good health!

The Third Labor Model Congress of Huade County, Chahar League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

　　内蒙化德县劳动模范上书毛主席
    争取今年农业生产达战前水平敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是内蒙古自治区察哈尔盟化德县第三届劳动模范大会的全体劳动模范，现在写信向您报告我们一九五零年的生产成就和一九五一年的生产计划。一九五零年我们在内蒙古自治区人民政府和您的英明领导下，我们全县打下的粮食，比一九四九年多百分之五十（其中有些村庄因为受到天灾虫害，只有七成年景；有一些村庄已接近战前生产水平），全县农民的食粮，已能够自给自足。一九五零年的畜牧，比一九四九年也有增加。其中牛增加了百分之二十，羊增加了百分之三十七，猪增加了百分之二十。一九五零年我们共植树二十万株，成活百分之七十。
    敬爱的毛主席，我国人民正在进行抗美援朝保家卫国运动。我们化德县的人民为了增加抗美援朝的力量，决定更加努力生产，要争取在一九五一年内使全县农业生产达到战前水平。祝您身体健康！
