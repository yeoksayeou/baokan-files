　　An Example of a Production Competition

　　The production competition in a certain tin mine in Hunan is one of the better-run production competitions in the mining industry. Since the competition began in December of last year, the ore output of the blasters has increased by an average of 71.5 percent compared to before the competition, direct production costs have decreased by 28.9 percent, a 70.9 percent decrease compared to July of last year, the monthly savings on detonators and explosives has been more than half, and production tasks have been exceeded by 85.7 percent.

　　The patriotic production competition in this mine was launched after leading cadres conducted in-depth patriotic ideological education among the workers. Before the competition, the cadres in the mine did not conduct sufficient ideological education for the workers, resulting in confused thinking, low production morale, and failure to complete tasks month after month. Therefore, the leading cadres of the mine's trade union and administration resolved to delve deeply into the worker masses and launch a patriotic production competition to change this situation. They first focused on educating the activists and Party and League members among the team leaders, and then, through the activists, they conducted widespread propaganda and education on resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting the homeland among the workers. They used real-life materials from the mine to compare the lives of workers before and after liberation, and then compared the lives of workers with those of farmers, and with the People's Liberation Army under the supply system. From these comparisons, the workers realized that their current status and living conditions were much better than in the past, and thus enthusiastically proposed: "To protect the homeland and defend the country, we must start with protecting the mountains and loving the mine." In order to promptly channel the workers' enthusiasm into production and consolidate this enthusiasm, the mine's administrative leadership also began to implement several urgent reforms: workers with severe occupational diseases working underground were transferred to surface work, the egalitarian wage system that was "anti-contracting" was adjusted; beds were purchased for the workers, bathrooms were cleaned up, and a mess hall was established.

　　These efforts not only boosted worker morale but also prepared favorable conditions for further improvement of management work. At that time, the competition movement had been initially launched within the mine. The mine then mobilized workers to formulate labor discipline and operating procedures. The cadres went into the mine to conduct inspections, using blackboards to promptly commend advanced workers, and posting each team's results every three days, summarizing them every ten days, and pointing out their strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned. The establishment of this inspection and summary system also promoted the development of criticism and self-criticism within each team.

　　Through these encouragement and organizational efforts, the workers' production enthusiasm and work attitude underwent significant changes. Cao Zhifan, Fan Kairu, and other members of the second blasting team voluntarily focused on drilling "heavenly gates" (the most difficult to drill positions overhead); Deng Yingsheng, Cao Piji, and others helped less experienced blasters identify "mountain exits" (choosing positions that could blast more rock) before setting the drill holes; after blasting, when other workers had left, they were still dismantling loose rock (loosened rock would impede the work of the next team, which was not done in the past); the number of teams drilling extra holes increased daily, and the "lazy hammer" had been eliminated. The efficiency of sand carriers also gradually improved, with more than ten people, including Yin Kaishi and Li Songsheng, increasing their load from 1,000 jin at the start of the competition to 2,300 to 2,500 jin; young worker Li Chuanqing carried a maximum of 2,775 jin, setting a new record.

　　Currently, the vast majority of workers in the entire mine are involved in the competition. To make the competition regular, the workers of the second team first experimented with establishing a small group responsibility system, with the group collectively guaranteeing production, safety, and non-damage to the project. Within the group, some tasks, such as guiding the identification of "mountain exits," were also assigned to specific people responsible. The Deng Yingsheng group, which implemented the system better, has had no accidents for two months. The average daily output of raw ore per blaster has doubled. This small group responsibility system is now being promoted in other teams.

### 一个生产竞赛的范例

　　一个生产竞赛的范例
    湖南某锡矿的生产竞赛，是矿山生产竞赛中进行得较好的一个矿。该矿自去年十二月开展竞赛以来，炮工的原矿石产量较竞赛前平均提高百分之七十一点五，生产直接成本降低百分之二十八点九，较去年七月份降低百分之七十点九，雷管、炸药每月节省一半多，生产任务被超过了百分之八十五点七。
    该矿的爱国主义生产竞赛，是领导干部在工人群众中进行深入的爱国主义思想教育后展开的。竞赛前该矿干部对职工的思想教育不够，职工思想很混乱，生产情绪不高，月月完不成任务。因此，该矿工会、行政的领导干部就决心深入工人群众，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，来改变这种情况。他们首先抓紧了对班组长中的积极分子和党团员进行教育，然后又通过积极分子向工人普遍展开抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传教育。他们利用矿山现实材料进行解放前与解放后工人生活的对比，又把工人生活与农民对比，与供给制的解放军对比。工人从这些比较中，认识到今天的地位和生活是比过去好多了，因而情绪高涨地提出：“保家卫国，要从保山爱矿作起。”为了及时把工人的热情引导到生产上来，并巩固这种热情，该矿行政领导机关又着手进行了若干急迫的改革工作：把在地下工作的生职业病较重的工人调到地面工作，调整了“反包头”后平均主义的工资；并给工人添购了床铺，整理了浴室，成立了伙食团。
    这些工作不但提高了工人情绪，而且给进一步改进管理工作准备了有利条件。当时竞赛运动已在矿内初步发动起来。矿方即发动工人制订劳动纪律与操作规程。干部们并到矿内检查，利用黑板报及时表扬先进工作者，把各班成绩三天公布一次，十天小结一次，指出它的优缺点及经验教训。这种检查总结制度的建立，也推动了各班组内批评与自我批评的开展。
    经过这些鼓励工作和组织工作，工人的生产热情和劳动态度有了显著变化。炮工第二班曹芝凡、樊开汝等六人自动专打天门炮（头顶上最不易打的炮位）；邓应生、曹丕基等在按炮眼位子前，帮助经验差的炮工看“出山”（选择能多炸石头的炮位）；放炮后别的工人都走了，他们仍在拆松石（石头炸松，妨碍下一班工人工作，以往是不拆的）；各班打加炮的逐日增多，“懒汉锤”已经消灭。背砂工人的效率亦逐步提高，尹开士、李松生等十余人由竞赛时的一千斤提高到两千三百斤到两千五百斤；青工李传清最高背二千七百七十五斤，创造了新纪录。
    现全矿绝大部分工人都卷入了竞赛。为使竞赛经常化，该矿二班工人首先试验建立小组负责制，由小组集体保证生产，保证安全，保证不破坏工程。组内有些工作如指导看“出山”等，亦选出了专人负责。其中实行较好的邓应生小组，已两个月没出事故。每个炮工的原矿石日产量平均提高一倍。现在这种小组负责制已在其他各班中推行。
