　　World Peace Council
    Resolution on the Struggle for Peace by Colonial and Dependent Countries
    The United Nations Charter, based on the right to national self-determination, has aroused great hopes in colonial and dependent countries. However, on this issue, as on many others, the United Nations has betrayed the expectations of the people by covering up violence and oppression in order to keep the people in a state of colonial dependence and oppression.
    This situation exacerbates the crisis of a new world war.
    The World Peace Council exposes the hypocritical propaganda that attempts to portray a new world war as the path to self-determination for the people of colonial and dependent countries. The Council believes that the united struggle of the people of all countries for peace is the decisive factor in the struggle for self-determination by the people of colonial and dependent countries.
    Peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict and other important Asian issues (Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaya), peaceful resolution of the German and Japanese questions, and the peaceful initiatives of certain Asian Arab countries and other peace-loving countries, all contribute to the maintenance of peace and the promotion of the right to national self-determination.
    The people of colonial and dependent countries are increasingly resisting aggression, oppression, the strangulation of their freedom, the involvement of their countries in aggressive pacts, the organization and use of native troops to attack the people of other countries, the stationing of foreign troops on their national territory, the cession of strategic bases, the seizure of their national resources, the degradation of their cultural values, and measures such as racial discrimination—this is naturally a contribution to the cause of maintaining peace.
    The World Peace Council welcomes the united struggle of the people of all countries against the war that threatens all mankind.

　　世界和平理事会
    关于殖民地与附属国争取和平斗争的决议
    以民族自决权为基础的联合国宪章，在殖民地与附属国唤起了很大的希望。然而在这个问题上，正如在其他许多问题上一样，联合国却为了要使人民继续处于殖民地附属的地位与受压迫的状态而掩饰暴力与压迫，因而辜负了人们对它的期望。
    这种事态使新的世界战争的危机更为严重。
    世界和平理事会揭穿力图把新的世界战争说成殖民地与附属国人民走向自决的道路的那些虚伪宣传。理事会认为：各国人民团结一致为争取和平而斗争，是殖民地与附属国人民争取自决权的斗争的决定因素。
    和平解决朝鲜冲突和其他重要的亚洲问题（台湾、越南、马来亚），以和平方式解决德国和日本问题，以及某些亚洲阿拉伯国家和其他爱好和平国家的和平倡议，都有助于和平的维护与民族自决权的伸张。
    殖民地与附属国人民，对于侵略、压迫、绞杀他们的自由，对于使他们的国家参加侵略公约，对于组织与利用土著军队攻打别国人民，对于外国军队驻扎在他们国家的领土上，对于割让战略基地，对于霸占他们国家的原料，对于贬低他们的文化价值，以及对于种族歧视等措施，正日渐加强他们的抵抗——这自然是对维护和平事业的贡献。
    世界和平理事会欢呼各国人民团结一致为反对威胁全人类的战争而斗争。
