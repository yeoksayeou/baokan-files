　　Newspapers in Rural Areas
    Raise Farmers' Political Awareness
    Letter from Comrade Wang Bin of the Land Reform Committee of the Changsha District Commissioner's Office of the Hunan Provincial People's Government:
    One of our comrades was reading the newspaper in the township government, and a group of farmers immediately crowded around, asking our comrade to report the news from the paper to them. A news article opposing the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism aroused much hatred among the farmers towards American imperialism. Hired laborer Li Jie'an said, "When the Japanese devils surrendered, more than fifty Kuomintang bandit troops followed thirteen American devils. As soon as they entered the village, they seized laborers. Before I could figure out what was happening, they beat me severely. In the end, they forced me to carry a sedan chair for the American devils, all the way to Meixian. We thirty-nine laborers were locked in a dilapidated temple. Mosquitoes were biting people to death at night. One laborer jumped over the wall and ran away but was caught and beaten mercilessly with gun butts until he cried out in agony. After being starved like this for four or five days, I finally stole away at Baling..." Middle peasant Yu Gezhang said, "The American devils instigated Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war, slaughtering the Chinese people, invading Korea and Taiwan, and now they want to rearm Japan. This is deliberately making enemies of the Chinese people. We must expand and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement so that everyone understands." Worker Li Dongsheng said, "If the American devils are not overthrown, we will not be able to truly stand up!" Zhu Shuangquan, a poor peasant's twelve-year-old child, said, "When I grow up, I will definitely join the People's Liberation Army and see if any imperialists dare to touch China!" During the discussion, they felt that newspapers were too precious for them, that whatever the farmers needed to know, it was published on top. Poor peasant Liu Boli said, "We can only learn from newspapers to understand how to be masters of our own house!" Hired laborer Wang Taoliang, who doesn't know a single character, is also very enthusiastic about starting a newspaper reading group. Under his call and mobilization, fourteen farmers have signed up to join the newspaper reading group. Woman Zhu Yongzhen said, "Even if I can't read, it's good to listen." Li Jie'an said, "Three generations without education have suffered greatly. I will save money and subscribe to a newspaper and join the newspaper reading group." Now, fifty-one people in the whole township have joined the newspaper reading group and have also subscribed to the Construction Daily and Hunan Youth Daily. They plan to write articles for the newspaper in the future, combining reading the newspaper with writing articles. They also stated: In order to oppose the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism, they are determined to read newspapers to learn about current affairs and strive to improve their culture.

　　报纸在农村
    提高了农民的政治觉悟
    湖南省人民政府长沙区专员公署土地改革委员会王斌同志来信：
    我们有一位同志在乡政府里看报，有一伙农民马上拥了上来，要求我们的同志替他们报告一下报上的消息。从一篇反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的新闻里，引起了许多农民对于美帝国主义的痛恨，雇工李介安说：“在日本鬼子投降的时节。‘刮’民党匪军别动队有五十多个人跟着十三个美国鬼子，一进村来就抓夫，我还没弄清是为啥事，辟头就把我猛打一顿。结果是逼着我去给美国鬼子抬轿子，一直抬到梅仙，我们三十九个夫子被关在一所破庙里，夜间蚊子咬死人，有一个夫子跳墙跑了被抓回来，他们拿枪托子给打得哭爹叫娘。这样饿了四、五天，一直抬到芭陵才偷跑回来。……”中农喻格章说：“美国鬼子支使蒋介石打内战，屠杀中国人民，侵略朝鲜、台湾，又要重新武装日本，这是存心和中国人民为敌，我们得把抗美援朝运动扩大深入，使每个人都晓得。”工人李冬生说：“美国鬼子不打倒，我们翻身也翻不好！”贫农朱双泉的十二岁孩子说：“我长大一定参加人民解放军，看那个帝国主义敢来碰我们中国！”在讨论中，他们觉得报纸对他们是太宝贵了，农民需要了解什么，上边就刊登什么。贫农刘伯立说：“我们只有学习报纸，才能懂得怎样当家做主人！”雇工王桃亮一个字也不认得，但也很热心搞读报组，在他的号召与发动下，有十四个农民报名参加了读报组。妇女朱永贞说：“认不得字，听听也是好的。”李介安说：“三代没读书，受尽了苦痛，省吃俭用，我也要订一份报参加读报组。”现在全乡已有五十一人参加了读报组，还订了建设报和湖南青年报。他们今后计划向报纸写稿，要把读报和写稿结合起来。他们并表示：为了反对美帝国主义武装日本，决心看报学习时事，努力提高文化。
