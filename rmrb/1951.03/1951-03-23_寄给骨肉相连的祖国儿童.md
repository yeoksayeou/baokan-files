　　To the Children of the Motherland, Flesh of Our Flesh
　　Editor's Note: This is a letter filled with patriotism written by Yu Chunhai, a common soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—a medic of the Second Company of a certain unit—on the Korean front, brought back by a reporter from this newspaper on the battlefield. He read this letter to all the soldiers in his class. Everyone said that this was exactly what they wanted to say in their hearts. Some even said: "It's well written, Chairman Mao should see it, so he knows how much we care about the motherland." This letter fully expresses the Volunteer Army soldiers' boundless love for the motherland and will make the people of the whole country even more concerned about and supportive of our Volunteer Army.
　　Seeing the People's Daily from the Motherland for the First Time in Korea
　　Today I am really happy to see the People's Daily from the motherland. Since going abroad, it has been difficult to get any news from home due to transportation difficulties. Because it is necessary to concentrate transportation resources on transporting all military supplies, the People's Daily could not be delivered to the Korean front in time. Today, the comrades have all gone up the mountain to study. There are important documents in the class, and I am left to guard the door. Suddenly, I remembered the People's Daily that the team headquarters sent yesterday. I happily ran to the team headquarters and saw a lot of newspapers. I grabbed three or four without hesitation and turned to leave. At this time, three planes were circling overhead. I took the newspapers to the air-raid shelter. I unfolded a newspaper, looking for good news from home. How we long to hear news from the motherland while we are in Korea! Suddenly, I saw the words "Liberated China" printed in the lower left corner of the newspaper. I started reading it intently.
　　The Happy Life of Children in the New China Has Increased My Determination to Resist America and Aid Korea
　　At this moment, I saw our lovely children in the newly released film (referring to the movie advertisements in the newspaper - editor). Several children were happily eating—that's the fruit of victory! Thinking back to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the Chinese revolution, and struggling arduously for twenty-nine years, only then could today's children live a happy life. Today's American imperialism wants to use all means to take away our fruits of victory; it wants to make 475 million compatriots its slaves. American imperialism has miscalculated. Today's China is a liberated China. Every compatriot has the spirit of hard work and diligence, and the power to defend their good life. For the sake of a happy life, we must eliminate the American invading army. As I watched, watched, the children squinted and smiled at me. A feeling of flesh and blood arose in me (I don't know how to write it well). I touched the lovely children of the motherland on the newspaper again and again.
　　I am Talking with You in My Mind
　　Lovely Chinese children, eat your fill! We are resisting America in Korea to protect your safety. Your happy life will continue forever. When you grow up, you will shoulder the task of building the new China's economy and culture and build an industrialized China. You are all treasures of the motherland, and a socialist society is waiting for you to build! You will make the lives of future generations of children a hundred times better than your current lives. Now your safety is fully guaranteed by us. We are determined to eliminate the American invading army and drive them into the sea, so that the children of our motherland can live a happy life forever. Now the American invading army on the Korean Peninsula has not been completely eliminated, and I cannot return home immediately. I really want to see you. When we eliminate the American army and return home in triumph, let's meet again!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yu Chunhai, Medic of the Second Company of a Certain Unit of the People's Volunteer Army

　　寄给骨肉相连的祖国儿童
    编者按：这是中国人民志愿军的一个普通战士——某部二连卫生员于春海在朝鲜前线写的充满了爱国主义精神的一封信，是托本报战地记者带回来的。他曾把这封信念给全班战士听。大家说这也正是每个人心里想要说的话。有的还说：“写得好，该叫毛主席看看，让他知道咱们是怎样关心祖国。”这封信充分流露了志愿军战士们对于祖国的无限热爱，也将使全国人民更加关心和拥护我们的志愿军。
    在朝鲜首次看见祖国的人民日报
    今天我真高兴啊，看到祖国的人民日报了。自出国以来，因为运输不便，很少得到国内一切消息。由于需要把交通力量集中在运输一切军用的物资，未能及时把人民日报运到朝鲜前线。今天，同志们都上山学习去了。班里有重要的文件，留我在家看门。忽然想起昨天队部发来的人民日报，我很欢喜地跑到了队部，见着了很多的报纸。我就不管三七二十一，拿了三、四张，扭身就走。这时，三架飞机在上空盘旋。我便将报纸带到了防空洞。我展开一张报纸，寻找着国内的好消息。身在朝鲜，我们是怎样盼着听到祖国的消息啊！猛然看见报纸的左下角印着“解放了的中国”的字样。我就目不转睛地看起来。
   新中国儿童的幸福生活给我增加了抗美援朝的决心
    这时，我看见我国可爱的儿童在新出的电影片中放映出来了（指报上的电影广告——编者）。几个儿童都在快乐地吃着饭——那是胜利果实啊！回想起共产党和毛主席领导中国革命，二十九年艰苦奋斗，才使今天儿童们能过幸福生活。今天的美帝国主义，它想用一切手段，把我们胜利的果实夺去，它想叫四亿七千五百万同胞给它当奴隶。美国帝国主义把算盘打错了，今天的中国是解放了的中国，每个同胞都有艰苦奋斗和勤劳的精神，有力量来保卫自己的好日子。为了幸福的生活，就必须将美国侵略军消灭。看着，看着，孩子们瞅着我眯眯地直笑，我身上生起一种骨肉相联的感情（我不知怎样写好），我一次又一次地在报纸上抚摸着可爱的祖国的儿童。
    我在思想上和你们谈话
    可爱的中国儿童，你们美美地吃饭吧！我们在朝鲜抗美，来保卫你们的安全。你们幸福的生活将要永远过下去。等你们长大，好来担负起新中国经济文化建设的任务，把工业化的中国建设起来。你们都是祖国的宝贝，社会主义社会正在等着你们来建设呢！你们将使得后代的儿童比你们现今的生活，更要好一百倍。现在你们的安全由我们来完全担保。我们决心把美国侵略军消灭掉，赶到海里去，让我们祖国的儿童过着永远快乐的生活。现在朝鲜半岛上的美国侵略军还没有最后消灭，我不能马上回国。我真想见见你们。消灭美国军，凯旋回国时，咱们再见吧！
