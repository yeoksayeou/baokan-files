    Fast's Angry Protest Against the Execution of Seven Black Men

    The famous American progressive writer Howard Fast wrote a letter to the editor of the "New Times" weekly, expressing his anger and protest against the execution of seven black men in Martinsville, Virginia. He wants the people of the world to know the truth about the "legal" killing of the seven black men in Martinsville by the United States.

    These seven young, strong workers, possessing dignity, courage, and honesty, were accused of rape, a common means used in the American South to execute black people without trial. Virginia has never executed a white person for rape; but many black people have died under this false accusation.

    In his letter, Fast rebukes the American government for its ruthless indifference to the voices of the people. In the days leading up to the execution, Truman and the Governor of Virginia received tens of thousands of telegrams and phone calls; but they were not moved by these calls for justice, just as they were not moved by the suffering of their victims in Korea. Truman felt no need to intervene in the matter of killing innocent people. Fast said that these evil people who are acting perversely in the United States must frankly tell us that they will never stop because of the protests of their own people, the terror and slaughter in Korea is closely followed by terror and slaughter at home. But a black worker in Harlem, a few hours before the execution of the seven black men, said to Fast: "Didn't they ever know that killing us will never make us quiet?"

    On the day the seven black men were executed, Fast searched throughout the New York Times, but could not find any short words mentioning the matter; no word acknowledging that all was not calm in this country that executes innocent people in this way. On the contrary, he found a statement by the newspaper defending the cancellation of the death penalty for Hitler's war criminals. Let the people of the world consider these things when they hear the "Voice of America"!

    法斯特对七名黑人被处死的愤怒抗议
    美国著名进步作家法斯特，写信给《新时代》周刊编者，对弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔七名黑人被处死一事表示愤怒和抗议，他要让全世界的人民知道美国“合法”杀害马丁斯维尔七名黑人的事情真相。
    这七个年青力壮，具有着尊严、勇敢和忠厚品性的工人，被控犯了强奸罪，这是美国南方不经法庭而处死黑人惯用的一种手段。弗吉尼亚州从来没有一个白种人因为强奸而被处决；但是已经有许多黑人在这个诬控的罪名下死去。
    法斯特在信中斥责美国政府对人民的呼声所表示的无情冷淡。在执行死刑的前几天，杜鲁门和弗吉尼亚州的州长曾接到成千成万人的电报和电话；但是他们并没有为这些正义的呼声所动，正如他们没有为他们的牺牲者在朝鲜所遭受的苦难所动一样。杜鲁门觉得没有必要来干预这个杀害无辜人们的事情。法斯特说，这些在美国倒行逆施的恶人，必须向我们直率说明，他们是决不因为他们本国人民的抗议而罢手的，朝鲜的恐怖与屠杀。紧跟而来的是国内的恐怖与屠杀。但是哈莱姆的一个黑人工人，在七名黑人处死之前几小时对法斯特说：“难道他们从来不知道，杀了我们决不会使我们安静下来吗？”
    七名黑人被处死的那天，法斯特在《纽约时报》上，遍处寻找不到任何简短的话谈到这件事；没有任何话承认，在以这种方式处死无辜人民的这个国家中，一切并不平静。相反的，他却发现了一段该报为取消希特勒战犯死刑一事所作的辩护声明。让全世界的人民听到“美国之音”的时候，考虑考虑这些事情吧！
