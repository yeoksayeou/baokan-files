[Beijing News] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: In order to consolidate revolutionary order in the capital and protect the safety of the people's lives and property, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has recently arrested a group of KMT-US spies, heads of reactionary secret societies, and despotic landlords. These counter-revolutionaries were mostly traitors and spies before liberation, who murdered the people, raped women, and opposed the revolution. After liberation, they persisted in their evil ways and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, steal state secrets, sabotage factories and enterprises, spread rumors, engage in robbery, or plot armed rebellion. They also possessed radio stations and large quantities of guns and bombs. They are all counter-revolutionaries guilty of heinous crimes.

Some of these counter-revolutionaries infiltrated factories, enterprises, and organizations to carry out various sabotage activities, endangering social order and the people's property. For example, Zhao Jingxian, Zhang Bingwen, Lü Qingchang, Lan Jingwen, Yuan Shuchun, etc., all infiltrated the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant after liberation. Zhao Jingxian harbored a large number of spies in the factory, covering their escape. When the factory workers launched a production competition, he incited the masses, saying, "Competing for heroes is simply competing to be fools; those who seize the red flag are all stupid idiots!" He used various methods to sabotage production and construction. Before liberation, Zhao Jingxian served as a puppet Baochang, and the chairman of the puppet trade union, conscripted men for the enemy, seized civilian grain, compiled a blacklist of underground CCP members and handed it over to the KMT secret service for persecution, and raped many women. His crimes were notorious. Zhang Bingwen and Lü Qingchang were both habitual bandits from the Lincheng area of Hebei Province. Lan Jingwen and Yuan Shuchun were accomplices of Wang Linzhang, the secretary-general of the KMT's Sanqing Tuan in Shijiazhuang. Before liberation, they all served as KMT secret agents, killing a family of six surnamed Yang and the seventh district head and district cadres in Lincheng, shooting more than ten people in Liangcun, burning more than twenty houses, and guiding the Japanese to bury Wang Heidou, a villager of Wangjiazhuang Township in Baixiang County, Hebei Province, alive. They also organized a special agent armed "Homecoming Corps" to attack the Hetou Village government in Gaoyi County, Hebei Province, in the liberated area, killing more than twenty district and village cadres on the spot. After liberation, they all infiltrated the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to work as workers. Lü Qingchang even became a policeman in the factory's police team, carrying weapons and preparing to take the opportunity to riot. Zhongtong (Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics) special agents Zhi Pengying, Zhi Yonghu, Shen Zhenqi, Lü Guangren, Li Shusheng, Wang Fuchun, Wu Zhenping, etc., were all important members of the special agent organization lurking in the Beijing Postal Administration, and frequently conspired to sabotage. Fang Wei, a former staff officer of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, the puppet police chief of Pingquan, Rehe, and the puppet county chief of Lingyuan, and Sun Xiaoyou, a Zhongtong agent, fabricated history after liberation, infiltrated the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau, stole confidential documents from the bureau, sabotaged tax collection, and frequently created rumors to disturb people's minds and carry out various sabotage activities. Fang Wei was a local tyrant in the western part of Liaoning. He collected traitors and bandits and organized a so-called garrison headquarters to kill revolutionary cadres and confront the People's Liberation Army. The bandit Shi Xiangru, who served as a traitor, colluded with the Japanese invaders in April 1938 to create the horrific Tong (Tong County) Da (Daxing County) massacre, burning more than fifty villages and killing countless people. In the three villages of Zhao Xianying, Daishanying, and Shaduiying in Caiyu Town, Daxing County alone, he slaughtered more than forty villagers and burned down more than 300 houses. Such a traitor and bandit infiltrated the Beijing Grain Trade Association after liberation and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.

There was also a group of KMT special agents who lurked in Beijing, resisted registration, plotted activities, and even colluded to rob and disrupt public order. For example, Wu Chunru, the inspector general and branch bureau chief of the puppet Beiping Police Bureau, had colluded with the 19th Regiment of the puppet Gendarmerie and the puppet Garrison Headquarters to arrest the staff of the Liberation Three-Day Publication, surrounded the North China College with sandbags and barbed wire, and rounded up progressive students from Peking University and Fu Jen Catholic University. After the liberation of Beijing, the criminal continued to persist in his evil ways and plotted sabotage. Jin Bogong, a secretarial secretary of the Inspectorate of the Puppet Northeast Headquarters and a military intelligence agent, fled to Beijing after the liberation of the Northeast, seeking relations with the KMT-US special agent organization "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" in an attempt to continue his activities. Lü Bingzhong, a Fuxing Society agent, served as an instructor in the Kuomintang Special Agents' "Qingxun Team," torturing and killing many revolutionary cadres. After the liberation of Beijing, he resisted control, refused to repent, and frequently engaged in counter-revolutionary propaganda, undermining the government's prestige. Mao Shixun, a military intelligence agent, specialized in going to the liberated areas to carry out sabotage before liberation. After liberation, he colluded with bandits to rob and kill people in the eastern suburbs, disrupting social order.

Among the arrested counter-revolutionaries were a group of despotic landlords who persecuted the people and resisted land reform. For example, Li Yangquan, a local tyrant from the Dianchang Village area in western Beijing, nicknamed "Little Nose" and also known as "Little Overlord," beat villager Meng Changnian to death and seized farmers' land during the period of Japanese puppet rule. After liberation, he threatened village cadres, saying, "If the tables are turned, I will beat you all to death." The farmers in the Dianchang area of western Beijing hated him to the bone and repeatedly complained to the Municipal People's Government. This time, he was arrested. Cui Guoying, a big local tyrant in Yamenkou Village, served as the puppet Lianbao director during the period of Japanese puppet rule, colluding with the Japanese puppet army to shoot and kill farmer Wang Wende, selling drugs, seizing land, and arresting more than forty farmers in Yamenkou Village for the puppet army. He also privately set up a court to torture the workers who resisted his deduction of wages. After liberation, he resisted land reform and destroyed the green seedlings of poor farmer Cui Jingrong. During the Resist US, Aid Korea movement, he threatened the masses, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek will come and take revenge." The farmers in the Yamenkou Village area hated him to the extreme and called him "Dragon King." They said, "Only when the government executes the Dragon King can the people live in peace." Xue Zemin, a despotic landlord in Shijingshan, forced five people to death, seized more than sixty mu of public land, and arrested four farmers for the puppet army. After liberation, he was still dishonest. When the Public Security Bureau lifted control, he threatened village cadres, saying, "The Public Security Bureau doesn't care about me now, so you can't control me even more."

Some of the heads of reactionary secret societies arrested this time participated in the Zhongtong special agent organization. For example, Yang Pei, the branch altar leader of Yiguan Dao in the northern suburbs, served as a puppet Baochang and led fifteen special agent groups to suppress the student movement at Tsinghua University. Some were plotting armed rebellion, such as Li Wenxian, the first general leader of the Jiugong Dao Yu Jiu Tianxiangming. After liberation, he gathered other Dao leaders to plot armed rebellion and subvert the People's Government. Some maintained secret organizations, resisted land reform, and sabotaged military facilities. For example, Chang Wentong, a despotic landlord and Yiguan Dao preacher in Shijingshan, opened a "Confession Class" after liberation to train Dao followers, copied "Nineteen Articles for Coping with Demonic Exams" and Sun Suzhen's "Hand Instructions" and "Altar Training" to resist the People's Government, directed fifteen altars to secretly gather, monitored our working cadres, and threatened the masses during the land reform in the suburbs, saying, "Don't be greedy for cheap, you will suffer great harm in the future," and posted reactionary slogans at the doors of village cadres. Last winter, he fired coded shots at home at night, directing Dao followers to repeatedly destroy military wires. When the Municipal People's Government ordered the banning of Yiguan Dao, Chang Wentong convened altar leaders Wang Guancai, Wang Sen, and others to a meeting to resist registration. He said, "The country should be led by Dao, and we will never register."

These counter-revolutionaries, lurking in factories, plotting sabotage, or organizing armed rebellion and robbing the people, pose a great threat to revolutionary order and the people's lives and property. If they are not arrested and punished, the security of the people's capital will be seriously damaged by them.

    巩固首都治安、保障人民生命财产
    京公安局逮捕一批反革命
    该匪犯等至今不知悔罪仍图潜伏阴谋暴乱
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：为了巩固首都革命秩序，保障人民生命财产的安全，京市人民政府公安局连日逮捕了一批美蒋特务、反动会道门的首脑和恶霸地主。这些反革命分子，多曾在解放以前当汉奸特务，残杀人民，强奸妇女，反对革命；在解放以后怙恶不悛，继续作反革命活动，刺探国家机密，破坏工厂企业，散布谣言，进行抢劫或阴谋武装暴动，并藏有电台和大批枪枝炸弹等。他们都是罪大恶极的反革命分子。
    这些反革命分子，有的混入了工厂、企业、团体，进行各种破坏活动，破坏危害社会秩序和人民财产。例如赵景先、张秉文、吕庆昌、蓝景文、袁书春等，在解放以后，都潜伏到石景山钢铁厂，赵景先在该厂曾窝藏一大批特务，掩护他们潜逃；当该厂工人展开生产竞赛时，他煽惑群众说：“争英雄简直是争狗熊，夺红旗的都是冤傻小子！”用种种方法来破坏生产建设。赵景先在解放以前，当过伪保长、伪工会理事长，为敌抓壮丁，强征民粮，开列中共地下党员的黑名单送交国民党特务机关加以残害，并强奸过很多妇女，罪恶昭彰。张秉文、吕庆昌都是河北省临城一带的惯匪，蓝景文、袁书春是蒋匪石家庄三青团书记长王麟章的同伙，在解放以前，他们都当了国民党特务，曾在临城一带解放区内杀害杨姓一家六口和该县第七区丁区长及区干部，枪杀梁村群众十多人，烧毁民房二十多间，引导日寇活埋河北省柏乡县王家庄乡民王黑豆，还组织特务武装“还乡团”，进攻解放区河北省高邑河头村村公所，当场杀害区、村干部二十多人。解放之后，他们都混到石景山钢铁厂来当工人，吕庆昌还当了厂警队的警士，手持武器，准备伺机进行暴乱。中统特务支彭英、支永祜、沈振启、吕广仁、李树声、王富春、吴镇屏等，均为潜伏在北京邮政管理总局的特务组织之重要分子，经常密谋破坏。伪国防部参谋、热河平泉伪警察局长、凌源伪县长方伟、中统特务孙效友在解放后，假造历史，混入北京市税务局，窃取该局的机密文件，破坏税收，并经常制造谣言，扰乱人心，进行各种破坏活动。方伟在辽西一带，为恶一方，曾收集汉奸、土匪，组织所谓卫戍司令部，杀害革命干部，与人民解放军对抗。当过汉奸的匪徒石相如，在一九三八年四月与日寇勾结，制造惨绝人寰的通（通县）大（大兴县）惨案，烧毁村庄五十多个，杀人无数，仅在大兴县采育镇的赵献营、岱山营、沙堆营三个村庄，就屠杀乡民四十多人，烧毁房屋三百余间，像这样的汉奸匪徒，在解放之后，竟混入北京粮食同业公会，继续进行反革命活动。
    还有一批蒋匪特务，潜伏京市，抗拒登记，阴谋活动，甚至结伙抢劫，破坏治安，例如伪北平警察局督察长、分局局长吴纯如，在解放前曾会同伪宪兵十九团、伪警备司令部逮捕解放三日刊工作人员，以沙袋、铁丝网，包围华北学院，并围捕北京大学和辅仁大学的进步学生。北京解放之后，该犯仍怙恶不悛，阴谋破坏。军统特务金伯恭是伪东北行辕督导处机要秘书，东北解放后潜逃来京，寻找美蒋特务机构“中美合作所”的关系，企图继续活动。复兴社特务吕秉中，曾充匪特务机构“清训队”训导员，拷打与杀害很多革命干部，北京解放后，抗拒管制，坚不改悔，且经常进行反革命宣传，破坏政府威信。军统特务毛世勋，解放前是专门往来解放区进行破坏的，在解放之后，伙同土匪在东郊行劫杀人，破坏社会治安。
    在逮捕的反革命分子中，有一批迫害人民，反抗土地改革的恶霸地主，例如京西靛厂村一带的恶霸李养泉，混名“小鼻子”，又称“小霸王”，在日伪统治时期，曾打死村民孟长年，霸占农民土地；在解放之后，威胁村干部说，“反过手来，都把你们打死”。京西靛厂一带的农民恨之入骨，向市人民政府屡次控告，这次把他逮捕起来了。衙门口村大恶霸崔国英，当过日伪时期的伪联保主任，勾结日伪军枪杀农民王文德，贩卖毒品，霸占土地，在衙门口村替伪军抓捕四十多个农民当壮丁，又私设公堂，拷打反抗他克扣工资的雇工；在解放之后，抗拒土地改革，毁坏贫农崔景荣的青苗；在抗美援朝运动中，他恐吓群众说：“蒋介石来了再报仇。”衙门口村一带的农民恨极了他，叫他作“龙王”，他们说：“只有政府枪毙了龙王，老百姓才能过安宁日子。”石景山的恶霸地主薛泽民，逼死过五条人命，霸占公田六十多亩，抓去四个农民给伪军；解放之后，仍不老实，公安局解除管制时，他威胁村干部说：“公安局现在都不管我了，你们更管不着我。”
    这次被捕的反动会道门首恶分子，有些是参加中统特务组织的，如北郊一贯道分坛主杨沛，当过伪保长，领导十五个特务小组，镇压清华大学的学生运动；有些是阴谋武装暴动的，如九宫道余九天祥明总盘第一总领李文显，在解放后纠合其他道首，阴谋武装暴动，颠覆人民政府；有些是保持秘密组织，反抗土地改革，破坏军事设备的，如石景山恶霸地主、一贯道点传师常文通，在解放以后，开办“忏悔班”，训练道徒，传抄“应付魔考十九条”和孙素真“手谕”、“坛训”以对抗人民政府，指挥十五个坛秘密集会，监视我工作干部，在郊区土地改革时，威胁群众说：“不要贪便宜，将来要受大害”，并在村干部门口黏贴反动标语；去年冬天，他晚上在家中打暗号枪，指挥道徒屡次破坏军用电线；市人民政府下令取缔一贯道，常文通召集坛主王贯才、王森等开会，抗拒登记，他说：“国家应由道来领导，决不登记。”
    像这些反革命分子，潜伏在工厂，阴谋破坏，或者组织武装暴动，抢劫人民，对革命秩序和人民的生命财产都是极大的威胁，如果不加以逮捕惩处，人民首都的治安是会受到他们的严重的破坏的。
