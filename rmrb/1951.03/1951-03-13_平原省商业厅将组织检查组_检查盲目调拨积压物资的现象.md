The Pingyuan Provincial Department of Commerce Will Organize an Inspection Team
    To Inspect the Phenomenon of Blindly Transferring Overstocked Materials

To the Editor:

    Regarding the article "Pingyuan Province State-Owned Trading Departments Blindly Transfer Overstocked Materials" published in the People's Daily's March 3rd "Letters from Readers" column, we have convened a meeting and conducted a serious study. We initially believe that this is due to our insufficient work, resulting in these serious and unreasonable phenomena. The article's presentation is very good and has promoted our entire trade work. We have decided to jointly organize an inspection team with various professional companies in Pingyuan Province within this week to seriously inspect the problems existing in each company's material allocation, focusing on the sections mentioned in the article. After the inspection is completed, we will send the inspection results. We are informing you in advance via this letter.
