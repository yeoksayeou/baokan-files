    Resolutely Fight Against Rogue Behavior

    To the Editor:

    I am a female student. After reading the article "Central Departments Investigate and Propose Handling Opinions on the Case of a Doctor from Yihua Textile Factory in Fengfeng Mining Area, Hebei, Insulting Female Workers," published in the "Reader's Letters" column of your newspaper on March 4th, I felt very indignant. Perhaps because I am a girl, I am particularly easily able to understand Comrade Lian Jiping's unfortunate experience, and at the same time, I hate Guo Yueyu's shameless behavior all the more.

    Guo Yueyu's lawless behavior of raping underage girls and threatening illegal abortions is completely a despicable act of hooliganism. In the past, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, this kind of behavior existed everywhere, was legal, and was protected by "law"; but today, under the new democratic regime, this rogue Guo Yueyu will surely be sanctioned by the people's law. Today, the people living under the new democratic regime must wage an irreconcilable struggle against the remnants of the old society like Guo Yueyu.

    I fully support the handling opinions proposed by the relevant central departments after investigating this matter. I solemnly demand that the government severely punish Guo according to the law, in order to punish the past and prevent future occurrences. Finally, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the unfortunate Comrade Lian Jiping.

                                                   Reader Xiao He

### 坚决向流氓行为作斗争

专栏：读者来信

    坚决向流氓行为作斗争编辑同志：
    我是一个女学生。当我读完了三月四日贵报《读者来信》栏刊登的“河北峰峰矿区益华纱厂医生污辱女工案，中央有关部门调查明白，提出处理意见”一文后，心里非常愤慨。也许因为我是个女孩子，所以特别容易体会到连吉平同志不幸的遭遇，同时也倍加痛恨郭月宇的无耻行为。
    郭月宇这种强奸未成年女子、威胁非法坠胎的目无法纪行为，完全是可耻的流氓作风。过去在蒋匪帮统治下，这种作风是到处存在的，合法的，被“法律”保障的；但在今天新民主主义的政权下，郭月宇这流氓必定要受到人民法律的制裁。今天生活在新民主主义政权下的人民必定要和旧社会遗留下来的像郭月宇这样的败类作不调和的斗争。
    我完全拥护中央各有关部门对这件事调查后提出的处理意见。我严正地向政府要求对郭犯应依法加重治罪，以惩前毖后。最后我谨向不幸的连吉平同志致以亲切的慰问。
