Workers from the No. 1 Manufacturing Plant of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company presented the Volunteer Army representatives with three American-made steel knives seized from the Kuomintang bandit army during the factory protection struggle before liberation, writing on the knife handles: Pick up American-made butcher knives and kill American butchers! Farmers in the city's suburbs also brought local products in comfort bags to give to them.
