Female Telephone Operator Wang Jingbin, Who is Excellent at Her Work and Does Not Avoid Hardships
    Zhang Lei
    Wang Jingbin, a telephone operator at the Andong Telephone Section of the Andong Railway Sub-bureau, created excellent working methods and improved work efficiency in the patriotic production competition, shortening the telephone waiting time from the bureau's set standard of 30 minutes to 5 minutes and 14 seconds. She also united everyone to persist in working under enemy bombing, ensuring smooth telephone communication and transportation safety. Her glorious deeds have spread throughout Andong.
    In the past, the work of the Andong Telephone Section was not very good. People using the telephones often criticized it for connecting the wrong calls, having a poor attitude, and slow connection speeds. Some even refused to give opinions in the telephone section's opinion book. They said, "You bring the opinion book around once a month, and we give you opinions, but you don't improve. It's useless to give more opinions. Correct your previous shortcomings before coming again." Wang Jingbin felt very sad when she saw this situation. She felt that as a Communist Party member, she should overcome difficulties and do her job well. Therefore, she worked hard to study her profession and often studied everyone's work situation. From the business learning materials issued by the superior office, she found that the working methods proposed by the Jinzhou Telephone Office of three fasts, three diligences, three goods, and two correctnesses (i.e., fast connection, fast hang-up, fast line removal, diligent study, diligent asking, diligent line checking, good attitude, good contact, good conservation, correct recording, correct handling) were very suitable for the needs of the telephone section of this segment. At the same time, she constantly researched with everyone in her work. According to the actual situation of the work, she also proposed: no wrong calls, no connecting of three-way calls, no idle chats with neighboring seats, flexible use of return lines, flexible execution of procedures, and flexible operation. She listed these key points of experience gradually accumulated in her work as six articles with eighteen points, calling it the "Six-Three" system. In the patriotic production competition, the Andong Telephone Section challenged all stations and sections with this new working method.
    Since the Andong Telephone Section implemented the excellent working method proposed by Wang Jingbin, the work has been greatly improved. For example, in August of last year, individual personnel made an average of more than 60 wrong calls per day. In September, after implementing the new working method, the error rate was reduced by more than 90 percent. Many employees who were unwilling to study learned new text abbreviations and telephone regulations within half a month. The call waiting time was shortened from the bureau's set 30 minutes to 5 minutes and 14 seconds. The connection time was shortened from 10 seconds to 2.7 seconds. Many comrades reviewing their past work believed that: in the past, the competition did not have clear goals and methods, and it always ended up with a lot of fanfare and little success. Now with the "Six-Three" system, the goals are very clear, and the inspection is more specific. At present, the "Six-Three" system has not only become the working system of the Andong Telephone Section, but also the telephone offices in the Andong Railway Sub-bureau have launched a movement to learn the "Six-Three" system.
    Wang Jingbin not only made excellent achievements in improving her business, but also demonstrated the heroic and unyielding spirit of a Communist Party member in the dangerous situation of enemy bombing. When American imperialism burned the flames of aggression to the edge of the Yalu River, Wang Jingbin often educated the members of the Youth League who worked with her, saying, "In any emergency situation, we must persist in our work; we must never leave our posts without permission, so that the telephones are not connected, which will cause losses to the country's transportation." The Youth League members were moved by her spirit of loyalty to the motherland.
    On November 8 last year, just after dawn, a large number of enemy planes continuously bombed and strafed along the Yalu River. The walls of the telephone exchange shook. But these did not shake Wang Jingbin's heart. She resolutely said to the comrades on duty: "Now is the time when the motherland needs us. The water of the Yalu River can dry up, but our will cannot be conquered. As long as we have a breath, we must stick to our posts and ensure that the telephones are open." In this way, the exchange operators of the Andong area telephone office successfully completed emergency calls under the bombing of enemy planes.
    As soon as the sound of the bombs passed, news came that the Yalu River Bridge had been bombed. Wang Jingbin thought, "This is the lifeline of transportation." She was brave and unparalleled, picked up a bucket of water and ran outside. She did not care about the smoke and fire, nor did she care that the enemy planes were still circling overhead. Other telephone operators also picked up hooks and sandbags and rushed out after her to put out the fire.
    Because of Wang Jingbin's glorious deeds, the broad masses of the people in Andong warmly loved and respected her, and gave her the title of "Model of Persistence in Work." Recently, she was also elected as an executive member of the Liaodong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.

　　工作优良不避艰险的女电话员王静彬
    张垒
    安东市铁路分局安东电务段电话员王静彬，在爱国主义生产竞赛中，创造了优良的工作方法，提高了工作效率，使电话等待时间，由局定标准三十分钟缩短到五分十四秒；她并团结大家在敌机轰炸下坚持工作，保证了电话畅通和运输安全。她的光辉事迹，传遍了整个安东。
    过去，安东电务段电话所工作很不好。经常因接错电话、工作态度不好、接线慢等而受到用电话人的批评。有的甚至拒绝在电话所的意见簿上提意见。他们说：“你们每月拿了意见簿来走一趟，咱给提了意见，您不改进，再提也是白搭，还是改正了以前的缺点再来吧。”王静彬看到这种情形心里很难过，觉得自己是一个共产党员，应该克服困难，把工作搞好。因此她努力钻研业务，并经常研究大家的工作情况。她从上级所印发的业务学习材料中，发现锦州电话所提出的三快、三勤、三好、二正确（即快接、快挂、快撤线，勤学、勤问、勤溜线，态度好、联系好、节约好，记录正确、处理正确）的工作方法很适合本段电话所的需要。同时她又在工作中不断和大家研究，根据工作的实际情况，她又提出：不错送电话、不接三股线、不与邻席闲谈，灵活运用回线、灵活执行规程、灵活操纵等，她把这些在工作中逐渐积累的经验要点列举为六条十八点，称它为“六三”制度。在爱国主义生产竞赛中，安东电务段就以这种新的工作方法向各站、段挑战。
    安东电务段自从实行王静彬提出的优良工作方法以后，工作有很大改进。如去年八月份个别人员每天平均送错电话达六十多次，九月份实行新的工作方法，差错减少了百分之九十以上。很多不愿学习的员工，在半个月内即都学会新文字略号和电话规程。通话等待时间由局定三十分缩短到五分十四秒。接转时间由十秒缩短到二秒七，很多同志回顾以往的工作都认为：过去竞赛没有明确的目标和方法，总是虎头蛇尾贯彻不下去。现在有了“六三”制，努力目标很明确，检查起来也比较具体了。目前“六三”制不仅成为安东电务段的工作制度，安东铁路分局管内各电话所，也纷纷展开学习“六三”制运动。
    王静彬不仅在改进业务方面有了优良的成绩，在敌机轰炸的危险情况下，她也同样表现了共产党员英勇不屈的精神。当美国帝国主义把侵略的战火一度烧到接近鸭绿江边的时候，王静彬经常教育和她在一起工作的团员们说：“在任何紧急的情况下，我们都要坚持工作；决不能擅离职守，使电话不通，而给国家的运输造成损失。”青年团员们都被她这种忠于祖国的精神所感动。
    去年十一月八日，天刚亮，大批敌机就连续不断地在鸭绿江沿岸肆行轰炸、扫射。电话交换所的墙壁被震得直摇幌。但是这些并没有震动王静彬的心。她坚决地向值班的同志们说：“现在正是祖国需要我们的时候了。鸭绿江的水可以干，但我们的意志不可以被征服。只要我们有一口气，就要坚持岗位，保证电话畅通。”就这样，安东地区电话所的交换员，在敌机的轰炸下，胜利地完成紧急的通话任务。
    炸弹的响声刚刚过去，就传来了鸭绿江桥被炸的消息。王静彬想到“这是运输的命脉”，她奋勇无比，提起水桶就往外跑。她顾不得烟火弥漫，顾不得敌机还在头上盘旋。其他的电话员也拿起钩子、砂袋，紧跟着她冲出去救火。
    由于王静彬的这些光辉事迹，安东市的广大人民热烈地敬爱她，送给她“坚持工作的模范”的称号。最近她又被推选为辽东省工会代表的执行委员。
