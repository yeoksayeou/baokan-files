　　Recognizing the Greatness of New China from a Visit to Land Reform in Northwest China
　　Professor Zhu Guangqian, Peking University

　　For twenty years, my activities have been confined to the narrow circle of the school, turning myself into a "frog in a well." This time, I participated in the Northwest Land Reform Visiting Group and spent nearly a month living with cadres and farmers in the countryside, witnessing firsthand the earth-shattering changes of land reform. This can be considered as jumping out of the well and seeing a great world. I have many observations, and I will now only choose the point that I think is most important to me to discuss.

　　This most important point is that visiting land reform made me realize the greatness of New China, and thus gave me a very firm confidence in its bright future. Since liberation, although I have learned about some of the government's programs, policies and implementation through books and newspapers, and I vaguely know that China has indeed stood up; however, I have not had the opportunity to directly see the internal truth of how a certain level of cadres carry out a certain department's work, so my understanding of New China is still one-sided, superficial, and vague. This time, visiting land reform in Northwest China, I had the opportunity for the first time to contact cadres at all levels of the People's Government, from the central to the rural levels, and to see with my own eyes how they carried out the great task of land reform. My vague understanding was thus concretized and clarified, and some of the terms I had heard before, such as "democratic dictatorship," "mass line," "class stand," and "united front," also gained rich content.

　　We participated in the summary meeting of the first phase of land reform work in Chang'an for a week, living with more than 700 working cadres at the county, district, and village levels, listening to six summary reports, and participating in cadre group discussions. After the meeting, we followed the work group cadres to Dongda Village at the foot of the Zhongnan Mountains, and lived with them in farmers' homes. We started by visiting, and finally participated in their group visits, understanding the situation, rectifying village cadres, expanding the village peasant association, mobilizing the masses, struggling against the despotic landlords, and the initial work of determining class composition. After having close contact with these cadres at all levels, my first thought was that the popular saying "good superiors, few middles, bad subordinates" is a lie. Superiors are certainly good, middles are not necessarily few, and subordinates are still good. They all consistently implement the just and clear policies with a humble and prudent attitude, a pragmatic and realistic spirit, and meticulous and thorough plans. We had more contact with the lower-level cadres, and their composure in speaking, their experience in handling affairs, their austerity in life, and their democratic style made us professors not only admire but also feel ashamed. From this, I can see that our China now has the two major magic weapons that ancient political thinkers believed were necessary for governing a country: "governing methods" and "governing people." The entire national structure has become an organic whole in which the whole and the parts are closely connected, and each cell is full of vitality. This situation is not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also far behind in capitalist countries such as England, America, and France.

　　In addition to the cadres, we had the most contact with the farmers. Although they are still largely similar in character and habits to the farmers I knew thirty years ago—they are still so diligent, simple, thrifty, hardworking, and resilient—they are very different in terms of class consciousness and political training. In the past, the farmers had long been oppressed and anesthetized by the ruling class, entrusting their lives of servitude to fate; now, the farmers recognize that they are labor producers, the masters of the new China, and are no longer willing to let the exploiters ride on their heads. In the past, the farmers were a heap of loose sand, regarding national affairs as the patent of the ruling class, unwilling to interfere and dare not interfere; now, the farmers have become an organized mass, understanding that politics is their own business, and they are very skilled at meetings, speeches, elections, reviews, criticisms, and so on. They have their own elected village governments, their own organized militia teams, their own night schools and literacy classes, and their own production plans discussed and decided upon, making the observer deeply feel that in today's China, a township or even a village is a small country, and all the functions of the entire national structure are being exercised in a concrete and miniature way in a village. Land reform has liberated the farmers, and the significance of this "liberation" is even more important politically than economically. Farmers account for about 80% of China's population, and they have largely established the foundation of democratic politics. Democratic politics in China can be said to have "taken root." Calculated on the basis of a national population of about 500 million, they account for at least 300 million or more. These 300 million or more people are gradually becoming "governing people." Just imagine how great this power is!

　　The above mentioned the issue of "governing methods," which is particularly important and worth discussing in more detail. Just as a township or even a village concretely and microcosmically reflects the entire national structure and its functions after land reform, land reform itself can also reflect all the measures taken by the People's Government in all departments throughout the country and the principles it abides by.

　　Here we first see the basic democratic principle of following the mass line. The first step in land reform is to mobilize the masses, to establish the masses' trust in the village regime by rectifying village cadres, to raise the masses' class consciousness by speaking out about grievances, and to unite the power of the masses by expanding the peasant association. When the masses are truly mobilized, they rely on the power of the masses to overthrow the feudal forces of the despotic landlords, carry out confiscation and distribution, strengthen the village regime, and promote production plans. The effectiveness of land reform work is usually directly proportional to the degree of mass mobilization. Land reform work that is not sufficiently mobilized has never failed. In places where the masses are not sufficiently mobilized, land reform work is mostly carried out by a few work group cadres in a way that is all-encompassing and compulsory. This method is not only prone to subjective errors and out of touch with public opinion, but also does not cultivate the masses' self-governance and self-defense capabilities. Once the work group cadres leave, everything will return to the state before land reform. This situation is being avoided everywhere.

　　Here we see the leadership of the proletariat. The masses need to be mobilized, and it is the work group cadres who are mobilizing the masses. In the process of mobilizing and after mobilizing, the work group cadres must often be in the position of helmsman. Their function is very subtle. On the one hand, they must trust the masses, and on the other hand, they cannot be the tail of the masses. On the one hand, they must strictly prevent all-encompassing substitutes and compulsory orders, and on the other hand, they must strictly prevent abandoning leadership, even to the point of laissez-faire. It is a difficult subject for work group cadres to grasp this subtle measure, to do it just right, not too much, not too little, and it is also a test of their ability and cultivation. Leadership cannot be relaxed, because farmers are inevitably somewhat weak in nature, such as being conservative, selfish, short-sighted, factional, and revengeful. If land reform work is completely left to the farmers themselves, many deviations will occur. The most obvious is the emotional excitement of the masses in the struggle. If the work group cadres do not firmly grasp the policy of "no random beatings, no random killings," random beatings and killings will inevitably be unavoidable. The cadres of Dongda Village in Chang'an County have repeatedly used this policy to educate the masses, but when it came to struggling against the despotic landlords, the farmers sometimes could not help but slap the landlords in the face, and insisted on executing him on the spot, otherwise they would not adjourn the meeting. After more than an hour of persuasion by the cadres, they agreed to send him to the people's court. This alone shows the importance of leadership.

　　Here we see the united front and the people's democratic dictatorship. The landlord class, with its ruling position gradually consolidated over thousands of years, rides on the heads of the farmers in economic, political, and cultural aspects, and its power is very deeply rooted. The basic force of land reform is the poor and landless peasants, and the poor and landless peasants have long been exploited and oppressed, and most of them have been oppressed to the point where they cannot stand up straight. If they rely solely on their own strength to fight against the despotic landlords, they will not be able to win. Therefore, land reform work must rely on the poor and landless peasants, unite the middle peasants, neutralize the rich peasants, and even divide, educate, and win over the lackeys who follow the landlord line, forming a powerful anti-feudal united front that has an overwhelming advantage over the landlord class, and then can guarantee the victory of the struggle. The organization leading land reform is the peasant association, which implements democracy for the peasants within the united front, as described above, and implements dictatorship for the despotic landlords, suppressing their reaction until they have been transformed through labor and assimilated into the working class. For example, the original director of the peasant association in Dongda Village, Chang'an County, was corrupt and perverted the law, oppressing the masses, and the mediation committee member smoked and trafficked drugs. There was concrete evidence. The work group cadres led the masses, and they always treated them with an attitude of "doing good to others," only giving them reviews and education. The director was removed from his post, promising to reform and start anew, and the committee member was temporarily expelled from the peasant association, agreeing to strictly carry out labor reform. Although the masses demanded much harsher punishments, they finally accepted the persuasion of the work group cadres, because both of them were poor peasants, they were "family members," and they should be classified as united and transformed. As for the despotic landlords in that village, they were not shown any mercy at all. The cadres spoke to them in a stern manner, not as amiable as they spoke to the farmers. After reasoning and struggle, they were immediately sent to the people's court to be punished according to law. Here we vividly see the clear class stand of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves.

　　Here we see the working system of the Communist Party. The leadership and execution of land reform have a complete system of institutions, from the land reform authorities of the Central People's Government, through the administrative region, province, and county land reform committees, to the peasant associations at the province, county, district, township, and village levels, layer by layer. Local opinions and experiences are transmitted to the central government layer by layer, becoming the basis for formulating policies and laws; the central government's policies and laws are transmitted to the local level layer by layer, becoming the basis for work. Everything is in accordance with the great principle of democratic centralism, and there is no phenomenon of blockage or disconnection. Secondly, for each task, before implementation, it is carefully considered and discussed by the cadres, and the methods and procedures are meticulously arranged through a long period of mature brewing among the masses, with plans and levels, and able to adapt to the reality and respond to changes on the spot, seeking to achieve success, without delaying or being impatient. After implementation, the cadres must immediately gather to review, to see where it was successful and where it failed, as a lesson for the next stage of work. For example, in Dongda Village, Chang'an County, the review of the director of the peasant association was preceded by a comprehensive interview in different directions, striving for the correctness of the materials, five or six cadre meetings, discussing the methods and procedures of the review, and two or three times of mass brewing, eliminating concerns and preparing for reasoning. Everything was mature, and then the work group cadres and the director himself had one or two long talks, trying to enlighten him, educate him, make him understand his mistakes, and sincerely accept the review, before holding a mass meeting for formal review. Despite such thorough arrangements, small deviations are still inevitable in the meantime due to insufficient enlightenment and education of the masses. After the meeting, the cadres gathered again to carefully review the experience of this review meeting, and the senior cadres present gave some criticisms and instructions. From this, it can be seen that there are not absolutely no bad elements among the cadres, and their work is not absolutely free of deviations, but because of the system of criticism and review, bad elements can be educated and transformed, and deviations can be corrected at any time, without affecting the overall situation.

　　Here we see that the Communist Party requires that every political measure and every detail in every work have an educational effect on the masses. Taking the above-mentioned review of the director of the peasant association in Dongda Village as an example, this review was a series of political lessons. It was education for the entire village of farmers, and the farmers therefore understood that to fight against the landlords, they must first rectify their own ranks; understood that the regime was established by themselves, and unqualified cadres could be criticized or removed by election; understood that people of their own class should not be pushed outside their own class to be used by the enemy, but should be united and transformed. It was not only education for the peasant association director who made mistakes, but also made other cadres understand some of the past mistakes, and the past Baotou style is no longer feasible in the present situation; understood that the power of the masses is great, and failure is inevitable without relying on the masses; understood the love and unity of the same class, as long as he reforms and starts anew, he is a farmer and can still stand in the ranks of the farmers. Finally, it was also education for the work group cadres themselves. They therefore understood that there were still some small deviations in the review meeting, because they had not been able to fully grasp the actual situation beforehand, the masses had not been fully mobilized, and the arrangements had not been thorough enough. Next time they do this type of work, they will be more cautious. This is just one example. In fact, we see the intention of education anytime and anywhere in land reform work. We people in schools have always known that reading books and listening to lectures is education. From land reform, we have seen that all practical work is education, and it is more practical and effective than school education. In terms of this understanding, land reform has also educated me.

　　What we have seen from land reform work is not only the above points, they are just a few of the more important points. What do they explain? They show that since the establishment of the People's Government, China has embarked on the broad road of a new democratic country. As exemplified by land reform, all the measures of the People's Government are based on a set of principles that are universally applicable and policies that are in line with reality, all through a system of organization that echoes from beginning to end and connects up and down, all according to a set of orderly and step-by-step plans, all require the effect of improving the happiness of the people, and at the same time, there is a group of well-trained cadres who can grasp the policies to lead the implementation. The central government is like this, and the local government is like this; land reform is like this, and other work is also like this. This is what is called having "governing methods" and having "governing people." This is the situation of a healthy country, as if a strong and powerful young man has a vigorous vitality flowing through every limb of the whole body.

　　Such a healthy country will be able to defeat all imperialist reactionary forces and steadily complete its great mission. Such a great country is worthy of our enthusiastic love and protection. After visiting land reform, I not only have this understanding in understanding, but also have this feeling in emotion. I think this is the biggest gain of my visit to land reform this time.

　　从参观西北土地改革认识新中国的伟大
    北京大学教授  朱光潜
    二十年来我的活动只限于学校的窄狭圈子，把自己养成一个“井底蛙”。这次参加了西北土地改革参观团，有将近一个月的工夫，在乡村里和干部与农民生活在一起，亲眼看到土地改革这个翻天覆地的大变革，算是从井底跳出，看见一次大世面。我的观感很多，现在只选择我认为对我是最重要的一点来说。
    这最重要的一点，就是参观土地改革使我认识了新中国的伟大，因而对她的光明的前途起了极坚定的信心。从解放以来，我虽然从书报上学习得人民政府的一些政纲政策和实施的情形，约略知道中国确已翻身站起来了；但是我还没有机会，能直接看到某一级干部进行某一部门工作的内部真相，所以我对于新中国的认识究竟是片面的，肤浅的，模糊的。这次参观西北土地改革，我第一次有了机会接触到人民政府从中央以至乡村的各级干部，亲眼看到他们怎样进行土地改革这件大工作，我的模糊的认识于是具体化了，明确化了，从前听到的一些名词如“民主专政”，“群众路线”，“阶级立场”，“统一战线”之类，也有丰富的内容了。
    我们参加了长安第一期土地改革工作总结会议，有一星期之久，和七百余位县区乡村各级工作干部生活在一起，听了六次总结报告，参加了干部小组讨论；会议结束之后，我们随工作组干部到了终南山脚的东大村，和他们都住在农民家里，始而参观，终于参加了他们的分组访问，了解情况，整顿村干部，扩大村农会，发动群众，斗争恶霸地主，以及初步划定成份的工作。和这些上中下各级干部有较紧密的接触之后，我第一个想法就是想到“上级好，中级少，下级糟”两句流行语是句谎语，上级固然好，中级并不见得少，下级也还是好。他们都上下一贯地以谦虚谨慎的态度，实事求是的精神，缜密周详的计划，来贯彻正大明确的政策。我们接触较多的是下级干部，他们说话的沉着，办事的老练，生活的刻苦，以及作风的民主，处处都叫我们这批教授不但佩服，而且惭愧。我从此看出，我们的中国现在已经有了古代政治思想家所认为治国的两大法宝：“治法”和“治人”，整个国家机构已成为全面与局部息息相通的有机体，其中每个细胞都充满着活力。这种情形不但在中国史无前例，就是英美法各资本主义国家也都还差得很远。
    干部以外，我们接触最多的是农民。这和我在三十年前所熟识的农民在品格和生活习惯上虽然还大体相似——他们还是那样勤俭朴实，刻苦耐劳——可是在阶级觉悟上和政治训练上，却已迥然不同了。从前的农民久受统治阶级的压迫和麻醉，把牛马生活全委诸天命；现在的农民认识了自己是劳动生产者，是新中国的主人翁，不肯再让剥削者骑在自己的头上了。从前的农民是一盘散沙，视国家大事为统治阶级的专利品，不愿过问也不敢过问；现在的农民已成为有组织的群众，明白政治就是自己的事，对于开会，发言，选举，检讨，批评等等都能做得很熟练。他们有自己选举的乡村政府，有自己组织的民兵队伍，有自己办的夜校和识字班，有自己商议定的生产计划，使观察者深切地感觉到：在今日中国，一个乡甚至于一个村，就是一种小型的国家，凡是整个国家机构的功能，一个乡村也在具体而微地行使着。土地改革使农民翻了身，这“翻身”的意义在政治方面比在经济方面还更为重要。农民占中国人口百分之八十左右，他们在大体上已经树立民主政治的基础，民主政治在中国可以说已“生了根”。以全国约五万万人口计算，他们至少占三万万以上，这三万万以上的人口都逐渐成为“治人”了，试想一想这个力量是多么伟大！
    上文说到“治法”问题，这一点特别重要，值得再说详细一点。正如土地改革之后，一个乡甚至一个村都具体而微地反映整个国家机构和它的功能，土地改革这一件事本身也可以反映人民政府在全国各部门的一切措施和所遵守的原则。
    在这里我们首先看见走群众路线那个基本的民主原则。土地改革第一步工作就是发动群众，借整顿乡村干部来建立群众对于乡村政权的信任，借说理诉苦来提高群众的阶级觉悟，借扩大农会来团结群众的力量。到群众真正发动起来了，就信赖群众的力量，去打倒恶霸地主的封建势力，进行征收没收和分配，加强乡村政权，推行生产计划。土地改革工作成效的好坏通常与群众发动的程度成正比例，群众发动不够的土地改革工作没有不失败的。群众发动不够的地方，土地改革工作大半由三数工作组干部以包办代替和强迫命令的方式来进行。这种办法不但易犯主观错误，不洽舆情，而且没有养成群众的自治力与自卫力，工作组干部走开后，一切就要回到土地改革前的状况。这种情形各地都在尽力避免。
    在这里我们看见无产阶级的领导。群众需要发动，而发动群众的正是工作组干部。在发动之中与已发动之后，工作组干部常须处在舵手的地位。他们的功用是很微妙的，一方面要信赖群众，一方面又不能做群众的尾巴；一方面要严防包办代替和强迫命令，一方面又要严防放弃领导，以至放任自流。要掌握这种微妙的分寸，做得恰如其分，不多不少，这是工作组干部的难课题，也是他们的能力与修养的考验。领导不能放松，因为农民在本质上难免有些弱点，如保守，自私，短见，宗派主义，报复主义之类。土地改革工作如果完全交给农民自己，就会发生许多偏差。最显而易见的是斗争场合中群众情绪的激昂，假若没有工作组干部坚稳地掌握住“不乱打，不乱杀”的政策，乱打乱杀就一定难免。长安县东大村的干部曾三翻四覆地拿这政策来教育群众，可是到了斗争恶霸地主时，农民有时还情不自禁地打地主耳光，并且坚持要把他当场枪决，否则就不肯散会，经过干部一小时以上的说服，才肯把他送交人民法庭。即此一端可见领导的重要。
    在这里我们看见统一战线与人民民主专政。地主阶级挟数千年来所逐渐巩固起来的统治地位，在经济，政治，文化各方面都骑在农民的头上，势力是非常根深蒂固的。土地改革的基本队伍是贫雇农，而贫雇农久受剥削和压迫，大半都已压得伸不起腰来，如果单靠他们的力量，来和恶霸地主作斗争，决不能操必胜之权。所以土地改革工作要依靠贫雇农，团结中农，中立富农，甚至对走地主路线的狗腿子施以分化，教育和争取，形成一个强大的反封建统一战线，对地主阶级有压倒的优势，然后才能保障斗争的胜利。领导土地改革的机构为农会，对统一战线以内的农民施行民主，有如上文所叙述的，对恶霸地主则施行专政，镇压他们的反动，一直到他们经过劳动改造，归化到劳动阶级为止。举例来说，长安县东大村原任农会主任贪污枉法，欺压群众，调解委员吸贩毒品，都有真凭实据。工作组干部领导群众，对他们处处存着“与人为善”的态度，只加以检讨教育，那位主任撤职，保证改过自新，那位委员暂时洗刷出农会，立约严行劳动改造，群众虽然要求远较严厉的惩处，终于接受工作组干部的说服，因为两人都是贫农，是“自家人”，应归于团结改造的一类。至于对待那村中的恶霸地主，却丝毫不留情面，干部向他们说话时都声色俱厉，不像向农民说话那样和蔼，经过说理斗争之后，就马上把他们送交人民法庭去依法惩办。在这里我们很生动地见出敌我分明的阶级立场。
    在这里我们看见共产党的工作制度。土地改革的领导和执行有一套完整的系统机构，由中央人民政府的土地改革主管机关，经行政区，省，县各级土地改革委员会到省，县，区，乡，村各级农会层层衔接，地方的意见和经验逐层传达到中央，成为制定政策与法令的根据；中央的政策和法令逐层传达到地方，成为工作的根据，一切都依照民主集中的大原则，丝毫没有壅蔽或脱节的现象。其次，就每一件工作来说，在施行之前，都经过干部的仔细考虑和讨论，群众中的长久成熟酝酿的方法次第的缜密安排，有计划，有层次，又能根据现实情况，临时随机应变，一切都求水到渠成，不拖延，也不急躁。施行之后，干部必马上集会检讨，看那里是成功，那里是失败，作为下一阶段工作的经验教训。例如东大村检讨农会主任，事先经过全面的分途访问，力求材料的正确，五六次的干部会议，讨论检讨的方法和程序，两三次的群众酝酿，扫除顾虑和准备说理，一切都成熟了，复由工作组干部和那位主任本人作一两次的长谈，尽量启发他，教育他，使他明白自己的错误，诚心接受检讨，然后才开群众大会作正式检讨。尽管布置这样周密，临时由于对群众的启发教育还不够，小偏差仍然不免。会后干部又集会仔细检讨这次检讨会的经验，在场的上级干部又给了一些批评和指示。从此可知，干部中并非绝对没有较坏的分子，他们的工作也并非绝对没有偏差，但是由于有批评检讨的制度，坏分子可以教育改造，偏差可以随时纠正，不至影响全局。
    在这里我们看见共产党对于政治上每一项措施，每一工作中的每一细节，都要求它对于群众有教育的效果。就拿上述东大村检讨农会主任为例来说，这次检讨是一系列的政治课。它对于全村农民是教育，农民因此明白了要斗争地主，必先整顿自己的队伍；明白了政权是自己建立的，不称职的干部可以由自己给以批评或用选举方式撤换；明白了本阶级的人不应推到本阶级以外，受敌人利用，应该加以团结改造。它不仅对于那位犯错误的农会主任是教育，使其他干部也因此明白了过去的某些错误，过去的保甲作风在现时已行不通；明白了群众的力量伟大，不依靠群众就准要失败；明白了同阶级的友爱团结，只要他改过自新，他是农民，就还可以站在农民的队伍里。最后，它对于工作组干部自己也是教育，他们因此明白了检讨会中还出了一些小偏差，由于事先还没有能充分掌握实在情况，群众还没有完全发动，布置还没有十分周密，下次做这一类工作，就要更谨慎些。这只是一端，其实在土地改革工作中我们随时随地都见出教育的用意。我们学校中人一向只知道读书听讲是教育，从土地改革中我们见到一切实际工作都是教育，而且比学校教育来得更切实，更有效验。就这一点认识来说，土地改革也教育了我。
    我们从土地改革工作中所见到的不仅上述几点，它们只是几点比较重要的。它们说明了什么呢？它们说明了从人民政府成立以来，中国已走上新民主主义国家的康庄大道。如土地改革所例证的，人民政府的一切措施都依据一套有放皆准的原则和切合实际的政策，都通过一个首尾呼应，上下一气的系统组织，都按照一套有条理有步骤的计划，都要求发生提高人民幸福的效果，同时，也都有一批训练有素，能掌握政策的干部来领导施行。中央如此，地方也如此；土地改革如此，其它工作也如此。这就是所谓有“治法”，有“治人”。这是一个健全国家的情况，仿佛像一个身强力壮的青年，有一股蓬蓬勃勃的生气周流贯注到全体中每一个肢节。
    像这样健全的国家是会能战胜一切帝国主义的反动势力而稳步去完成她的伟大使命的，像这样伟大的国家是值得我们每个人热忱爱戴而加以保卫的。从参观土地改革以后，我不但在理解上有这种认识，而且在情感上也有这种体会。我认为这是我这次参观土地改革的最大收获。
