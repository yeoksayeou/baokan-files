　　We Must Undertake the Great Task of Popularizing and Deepening the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda and Education Work
　　Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China, Wu Yuzhang
　　In order to popularize and deepen the patriotic propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and to prepare for this year's "May Day" national demonstration as soon as possible, the China Peace Committee and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have issued special circulars or instructions, and the People's Daily and the Workers' Daily have published special editorials and articles. This shows that the patriotic propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the primary political task before the people of the whole country today. For this reason, the China Peace Committee put forward a fighting slogan: "We must ensure that everyone in every place in the country receives this patriotic education and actively participates in this patriotic action." Because: "Only with the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea can we, together with the people of the world, stop the imperialist war plan, strive for the realization of the Five-Power Peace Pact, and defend world peace."
　　On the issue of popularizing and deepening the propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, Chinese educators bear greater responsibilities than other sectors of the people. At the same time, we also have more convenient conditions than other sectors of the people in carrying out this work. In the past period, Chinese educators have done a lot of work in carrying out propaganda and education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and have achieved great results. These works and achievements have aroused great attention from the International Federation of Teachers' Associations. The chairman, secretary-general, and members of the Executive Bureau of the International Federation of Teachers' Associations also sent a special telegram of tribute to Chinese educators for this matter. I hope that our national educators will fully utilize and give play to these favorable conditions, and strive to undertake and complete this great and sacred patriotic task. Now, let me first talk about the responsibilities that our educators should bear and the favorable conditions they possess in carrying out this work:
　　First, we educators are engaged in educating the people as a specialized profession. This kind of current affairs education that combines patriotism and internationalism to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea should and must become an important part of our education of the Chinese people, especially the younger generation. It should become an important part of our educational work. The quality of this work and whether there are achievements should become an important indicator of the size and quality of our educators' educational achievements.
　　Second, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, there are now more than 1.2 million educators in the country (tens of thousands of teachers of spare-time education for workers and staff have not been included), and there are 24.5 million students. If we calculate each teacher and student's family, with an average of three to four people per family, as long as we propagate to their families through the students we directly educate, the number of people we can propagate to is about 100 million, which is already a considerable number in terms of popularization. Not to mention the publicity teams organized by our educators and students, which carry out publicity among the broad masses. We educators are not only large in number, but also widely distributed. We are distributed in every corner of cities and villages, and among the people of all classes, including workers, farmers, merchants, and even soldiers (as cultural teachers).
　　Third, in terms of the necessary conditions for carrying out propaganda and education work, such as writing articles and painting, in our country where illiteracy accounts for 80%, our educators also have incomparable advantages over other classes of people. So I said: In realizing the fighting slogan of "ensuring that everyone in every place in the country receives this patriotic education," we educators bear greater responsibilities and have more convenient conditions than people of other classes. According to the circular of the China Peace Committee on March 14, the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on March 8, and the methods indicated in the People's Daily editorial on March 17, I put forward the following opinions as a reference for everyone to carry out this work:
　　First of all, our educators across the country must recognize the importance of the task of propaganda and education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and consciously and bravely take it up, without shirking responsibility or abandoning their duties.
　　Secondly, we educators ourselves must strengthen our study of current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. If we ourselves do not understand or do not understand thoroughly, we cannot propagate to others or educate others.
　　Third, the central content of the current propaganda and education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is: opposing the U.S. rearmament of Japan; supporting our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army; supporting the declaration and various resolutions of the First World Peace Council on the conclusion of a peace treaty; and, in connection with the specific circumstances of various places, supporting the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and other major current political struggles.
　　Fourth, in terms of the methods and steps of carrying out this kind of propaganda and education, various mass gatherings should be convened in a prepared manner according to the specific circumstances of various places, focusing on accusing the crimes of the U.S., Japan, and Chiang, recalling the past, comparing the present, so as to enlighten the political consciousness of the masses, and guide the masses from anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the country and support land reform, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and strive for actual actions such as production. Experience in various places has proved that this method of accusation meetings, recollections, and comparisons is extremely effective in educating the masses. Masses who have not held accusations, whether urban or rural, can generally hold them. At the accusation meeting or other gatherings, the declaration of support for the peace treaty should be passed and votes should be taken against arming Japan.
　　Fifth, the current propaganda and education movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea should be combined with the preparatory work for the "May Day" national demonstration, so that the masses participating in the "May Day" demonstration understand the meaning of the demonstration and have vigorous enthusiasm. A good "May Day" national demonstration has great political and educational significance for the broad masses. In cities, all teachers and students should be mobilized to participate, and people from other sectors should also be mobilized to participate as much as possible. In rural areas, all farmers should be mobilized to march and demonstrate by township (administrative village) or by district.
　　Sixth, educational trade union organizations at all levels, every school, and even every teacher and staff member, must formulate their own specific propaganda work plans based on the above-mentioned general guidelines and tasks, combined with the specific circumstances at that time and place. Leading organs at all levels should urge and check their subordinate organizations or members on time.
　　Seventh, it is necessary to regularly summarize the experience of propaganda and education work in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and use local newspapers, periodicals, and radio to disseminate it in a timely manner.
　　Finally, in order to do this work well, educational trade union organizations in various places must obtain the support and cooperation of the educational administration and other people's organizations. It is impossible to do a good job by relying on the educational trade union itself.
　　Comrades of educational trade union organizations at all levels and all educators across the country! Popularizing and deepening the propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and preparing for the "May Day" national demonstration are serious political tasks at present. We must take the initiative, bravely take on and strive to complete this great political task. We must seize this opportunity for learning and training, so that we can improve ourselves politically and move our educational workers' trade union work forward.

### 我们要负起普及与深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作的伟大任务

　　我们要负起普及与深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作的伟大任务
    中国教育工作者工会全国委员会主席  吴玉章
    为了普及与深入抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传教育工作，及早地准备今年的“五一”全国大示威，中国人民抗美援朝总会及中华全国总工会都发布了专门的通告或指示，人民日报与工人日报都发表了专门的社论与文章。这说明抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传教育工作，是今天摆在全国同胞们面前的头等的政治任务。为此，中国人民抗美援朝总会提出了战斗性的口号：“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这个爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国行动。”因为：“只有抗美援朝的胜利，我们才能和世界人民在一起，制止帝国主义的战争计划，争取五国和平公约的实现，保卫世界和平。”
    在普及与深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作的问题上，中国教育工作者比较其他各界人民负有更大的责任。同时在进行这一工作时，我们也较比其他各界人民，有着更便利的条件。过去这一个时期，中国教育工作者在开展抗美援朝的宣传教育方面，已作了很多的工作，并获得了很大的成绩。这些工作与成绩已引起教育工作者工会国际极大的重视。教育工作者工会国际行政局的主席、总书记及各位委员还专门为此事向中国教育工作者发了一个致敬的电报。我希望我们全国教育工作者，要充分的运用并发挥我们这些有利的条件，努力的担负起并完成这一伟大而神圣的爱国任务。现在首先让我来谈一下，我们教育工作者在进行这一工作时所应负的责任与拥有的有利条件：
    第一、我们教育工作者是以对人民进行教育工作为专门职业的。这种爱国主义与国际主义相结合的抗美援朝的时事教育，应当而且必须成为我们教育中国人民，尤其是青年一代一个重要的内容。成为我们的教育业务的一个重要组成部分，这种工作做的好坏，有无成绩，应当成为我们教育工作者教育工作成绩的大小与好坏的一个重要标志。
    第二、据中央人民政府教育部统计，现在全国教育工作者有一百二十余万（数万多个职工业余教育教师还未包括在内），有两千四、五百万个学生。若以每个教员与学生的家庭，每家平均以三口到四口人计算，只要通过我们直接所教育的学生向他们的家庭去宣传，我们所能够宣传到的人就有一万万左右，这在普及工作上已经是一个不小的数目。更不说我们教育工作者与学生所组织的宣传队，在广大群众中所进行的宣传了。我们教育工作者不仅数量多，而且散布的面也广，我们是散布在城市和乡村的各个角落，散布在工人、农民、商人甚至兵士（当文化教员）各个阶层的人民群众中。
    第三、在进行宣传教育工作所必要的条件如写文章、绘画等方面，在我们这个文盲占百分之八十的国家内，我们教育工作者也比其他各阶层人民有着无可比拟的优越条件。所以我说：在实现“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这个爱国教育”这个战斗口号时，我们教育工作者比其他各阶层的人民，是负着更大的责任，有着更便利的条件。根据中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四的通告，中华全国总工会三月八日的指示，以及人民日报三月十七日社论中所指示的办法，我提出以下的意见作为大家进行这一工作时的参考：
    首先就是我们全国教育工作者自己要认清抗美援朝的宣传教育这个任务的重要，而自觉地勇敢地担负起来，不要推诿，放弃职责。
    其次就是我们教育工作者自己必须加强关于抗美援朝时事教育的学习，如果我们自己不懂或者懂的不透彻，我们就不能去宣传别人教育别人。
    第三、当前抗美援朝宣传教育的中心内容，就是：反对美国重新武装日本；支援我国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军；拥护第一届世界和平理事会的关于缔结和平公约宣言及各项决议；联系各地的具体情况，拥护土地改革与镇压反革命等当前重大政治斗争。
    第四、在进行这种宣传教育的方式方法与步骤上，要按照各地的具体情况，有准备地召集各种群众集会，着重控诉美、日、蒋的罪行，回忆过去，比较现在，借以启发群众的政治觉悟，引导群众由反日、反蒋走向抗美援朝保家卫国，拥护土地改革，镇压反革命，努力生产等实际行动。各地的经验证明，这种控诉会，回忆与对比的办法，对教育群众极为有效。凡未举行过控诉的群众，无论城乡均可普遍举行。在控诉会或其他集会上，应通过拥护和平公约宣言，和投票反对武装日本。
    第五、目前抗美援朝的宣传教育运动应当与“五一”全国大示威的准备工作结合起来，使参加“五一”示威的群众都懂得示威的意义，有旺盛的热情。“五一”全国大示威举行得好，对于广大群众有极大的政治教育意义。在城市中应动员全体教职员及学生参加，其他各界人民也尽量动员他们参加。在农村中应动员全体农民分乡（行政村）或分区游行示威。
    第六、各级教育工会组织，每一个学校，以至每个教员、职员，都要根据上述这种总的方针与任务，结合当时当地的具体情况，订出自己的具体的宣传工作计划。各级领导机关应当对于所属的组织或会员按时加以督促与检查。
    第七、要经常地总结抗美援朝宣传教育工作的经验，并利用当地的报纸、刊物与广播及时地加以传播。
    最后，要使这一工作能够做好，各处教育工会组织必须取得教育行政方面以及其他各种人民团体的支持与配合，光靠教育工会本身是不可能搞得很好的。
    全国各级教育工会组织及全体教育工作者同志们！普及与深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，准备“五一”全国大示威，是当前一个严重的政治任务。我们要主动地勇敢地来担负起并努力地去完成这个伟大的政治任务。我们要抓住这个学习与锻炼的机会，使我们自己在政治上提高一步，并且把我们教育工作者工会的工作向前推进一步。
