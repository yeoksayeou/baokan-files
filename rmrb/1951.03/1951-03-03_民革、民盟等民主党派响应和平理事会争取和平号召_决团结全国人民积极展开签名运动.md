The declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Council have been warmly endorsed by various democratic parties in our country. In addition to the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Zhi公Party, and the September 3rd Society, which have already published their views in this newspaper, expressing their willingness to strive for the realization of the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, non-party democrats, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have also expressed their views, stating their determination to unite the people and fight to the end for the conclusion of a peace pact and the realization of the World Peace Council's resolutions.

    A spokesman for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said: The World Peace Council's first session passed a declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers and nine important resolutions, which fully demonstrates that the World Peace Council represents the will of peace-loving people around the world, and exerts the power of peace-loving people worldwide to make these important decisions.

    The United Nations, which has degenerated into a tool for imperialist aggression by launching the Korean War and further expanding the Far East War, undermining the entire world peace, stands in sharp contrast to the World Peace Council, which makes sincere contributions to the cause of world peace and has won unanimous support and widespread support from peace-loving people around the world. We believe that if the United Nations cannot correct its erroneous measures, it cannot undertake the sacred task of promoting international peace. On the other hand, we hope that the World Peace Council will fully exert its great role in leading the world's peace-loving people, continue to struggle, to stop crazy aggression, and to ensure world security.

    We firmly support the World Peace Council's resolution on peaceful settlement of the German, Japanese, and Korean issues, and other issues, especially the request that the five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France—conclude a peace pact. This is a highly just call, a great call for peace. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is determined to call on all party members, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, to actively launch a universal, in-depth, enthusiastic, and magnificent signature campaign to support this just and historic great peace declaration.

    A spokesman for the China Democratic League said: The China Democratic League warmly welcomes and firmly supports the declaration and various resolutions issued by the World Peace Council from Berlin. These great documents in human history are excellent solutions for stabilizing and settling the current urgent international situation. This is a great call for peace. This is the drum of the righteous advance. This is the bugle call of justice. This is the roar of the vast majority of people in the world, the absolutely good people, against aggression, against war, wanting peace, and wanting security.

    The spokesman said: Standing on the position of the Chinese people, we must first welcome and support the World Peace Council's resolution condemning the United Nations. The spokesman continued: The American imperialists used the shameless method of framing by robbers to steal the name of the United Nations to slander our People's Republic of China as an "aggressor." The Peace Council's judgment that the shameless trick of Chen功 Lake is "unjust and illegal" proves that there is still justice and fairness in the human world.

    After praising the World Peace Council's fair resolutions on the settlement of the German, Japanese, and Korean issues, the spokesman said: The most wise achievement of the World Peace Council at the Berlin meeting was the declaration requesting the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. As early as September 1949, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had proposed to the Fourth United Nations General Assembly to "condemn preparations for a new war, ban atomic weapons, and conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace." The American imperialists used the United Nations voting machine to shamelessly reject this just request. Our People's Republic of China has always agreed with and supported this proposal of the Soviet Union. The requirement to conclude a five-nation peace pact is a concrete and practical test of who wants peace and who wants war internationally.

    The spokesman finally said: The World Peace Council's call to consolidate peace and ensure security has been issued. The mobilization order for the world peace team has been issued. "We cannot wait for peace, we must strive for peace" This is an absolutely true law. The China Democratic League warmly welcomes and firmly supports the declaration and resolutions issued by the Peace Council. We call on all members of the League, unite the people of China and the people of the world, and work together for world peace and human security!

    A spokesman for non-party democrats of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stated: The World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact and the nine resolutions passed have clearly pointed out the road to strive for peace for all peace-loving people in the world. This is a new historic great decision, and the struggle to defend world peace is more specific and powerful. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet government have consistently adhered to preventing war and maintaining peace. Marshal Stalin recently said that war is not inevitable. The imperialist aggression group headed by the United States, in violation of the world people's desire for peace, vainly attempts to launch a new war. In order to strive for peace, the World Peace Council advocates the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, which is an urgent task to defend world peace at present. This will be a test for the people of the world to see who is for peace and who has aggressive intentions. We warmly support the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions and are willing to fight for their realization.

    A statement from the China Association for Promoting Democracy said: The World Peace Council, representing more than one billion peace-loving people from more than eighty countries, passed a declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers and ten documents including a resolution on the United Nations in Berlin. This is another historically significant action program to strive for world peace following the speech by Soviet Marshal Stalin on the current international situation. This is the unanimous will of all peace-loving people in the world, and we firmly support it. And call on all members, the people of the whole country, and the people of the world to sign this great declaration and fully support the implementation of various resolutions.

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a statement stating that the World Peace Council's request that China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France conclude a peace pact to consolidate peace and ensure international security is a powerful and correct suggestion. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party stated that it fully agrees with the various resolutions passed by the World Peace Council, and calls on all party members to study this resolution; at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the patriotic action of resisting America and aiding Korea, and strive to the end to implement the goals set by the World Peace Council.

　　民革、民盟等民主党派响应和平理事会争取和平号召 
    决团结全国人民积极展开签名运动
    【本报讯】世界和平理事会的宣言和决议，获得我国各民主党派的热烈拥护。除民主建国会、中国致公党、九三学社已经在本报发表意见，表示愿为实现和平理事会的宣言和决议而奋斗外，现又有中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、无党派民主人士、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党发表意见，表示决团结全国人民，为争取缔结和平公约，实现和平理事会的决议而斗争到底。
    中国国民党革命委员会发言人发表谈话说：世界和平理事会首届会议通过缔结五大国和平公约宣言及九项重要决议，这充分表现了世界和平理事会是代表了全世界爱好和平人民的意志，发挥了全世界拥护和平人民的力量，来作这些重大决定。
    以自甘堕落为帝国主义侵略势力的工具来发动朝鲜战争并进而扩大远东战争、破坏整个世界和平的联合国，与这为保卫世界和平事业而作衷心贡献并且赢得了全世界爱好和平人民一致拥护与广泛支持的世界和平理事会，恰成为一个鲜明而尖锐的对照。我们认为联合国如不能自行纠正错误的措施，就不能担当促进国际和平的神圣任务。另一方面，我们祝望世界和平理事会充分发挥它领导全世界和平人民的伟大作用，持续奋斗，来制止疯狂侵略，保障世界的安全。
    世界和平理事会关于和平解决德、日、朝鲜问题及其他问题的决议，正如前面所说，我们是坚决拥护，特别是关于要求五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国及法国——缔结和平公约。这是一个高度正义的呼声，是一个伟大和平的号召。中国国民党革命委员会决号召全党同志，和全国人民一起，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，积极展开一个普遍深入热烈雄壮的签名运动，来支持这一具有正义性、历史性的伟大和平宣言。
    中国民主同盟发言人发表谈话称：中国民主同盟热烈地欢迎、坚决地拥护这次世界和平理事会从柏林发布出来的宣言和各项决议。这些人类历史上伟大的文件，是今天国际上紧急局面中安危定乱的优良方案。这是伟大的和平号召。这是正义的进军鼓。这是公理的冲锋号。这是世界上极大多数人民，绝对善良人民，反侵略，反战争，要和平，要安全的怒吼。
    发言人说：站在中国人民的立场，我们首先要欢迎并拥护世界和平理事会谴责联合国的决议。发言人继称：美帝国主义者用强盗栽赃的无耻办法，盗用联合国名义诬蔑我中华人民共和国为“侵略者”。和平理事会判定成功湖的无耻把戏是“不公正而且非法的”，这证明人类世界中还有正义还有公道。
    发言人在赞扬世界和平理事会关于解决德、日、朝鲜问题等的公正决议后说：世界和平理事会在柏林会议中最具有伟大智慧的成就是要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言。早在一九四九年九月，苏联外长维辛斯基即曾向第四届联合国大会提出过“谴责新战争准备，禁用原子武器及缔结五强以加强和平的公约”。美帝国主义者利用联合国表决机器对这个正义的要求无耻地加以否决。我中华人民共和国对苏联这个主张是一向赞同而且拥护的。国际上谁要和平，谁要战争，缔结五国和平公约的要求是个具体而切实的考验。
    发言人最后说：世界和平理事会巩固和平，保障安全的号召出来了。全世界和平队伍的动员令已经发布了。“不能等待和平，必须争取和平”这是绝对真确的律规。中国民主同盟热烈地欢迎坚决地拥护这次和平理事会所发表的宣言与决议。我们号召全体盟员，团结全中国人民和全世界人民，共同为世界和平人类安全而奋斗！
    中国人民政协无党派民主人士发言人发表谈话称：世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言及通过的九项决议，为全世界爱好和平的人民明确地指出了争取和平的道路。这是一个新的历史性的伟大决定，世界保卫和平的斗争更具体有力了。中华人民共和国和苏联政府一贯地坚持防止战争和维护和平，斯大林大元帅最近说过了战争不是不可避免的。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，则违背了世界人民的和平意向，妄图发动新的战争。世界和平理事会为了争取和平，主张五大国缔结和平公约，这是当前保卫世界和平的迫切任务。这将是对全世界人民的一种考验，究竟谁是拥护和平的，谁是有侵略图谋的。我们热烈拥护世界和平理事会的宣言和决议，并愿为其实现而斗争。
    中国民主促进会的声明说：世界和平理事会代表着八十多个国家十数亿爱好和平的人民，在柏林通过了关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言及关于联合国的决议等十项文件。这是继苏联斯大林大元帅就目前国际形势发表谈话之后，又一具有历史意义的争取世界和平的行动纲领。这是全世界爱好和平人民一致的意志，我们坚决拥护。并且号召全体会员，全国人民，及全世界人民都在这伟大的宣言上签名，并全力支持各项决议的付诸实施。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会发表声明认为，世界和平理事会要求中、苏、美、英、法五国缔结和平公约，用以巩固和平，保障国际的安全，是一个有力的正确的建议。中国农工民主党表示，完全同意世界和平理事会通过的各项决议，号召全党党员学习这个决议；同时要更加强抗美援朝的爱国行动，为贯彻世界和平理事会所规定的目标而奋斗到底。
