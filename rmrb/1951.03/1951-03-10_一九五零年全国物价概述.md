　　Overview of National Prices in 1950
    Yang Bo
            I
    The basic trend of national price development and changes in 1950 (excluding the Northeast region, the same below) can be summarized as rising in January, February, and March, falling in April and May, and generally stabilizing from June onwards. The situation of currency inflation and soaring prices of the past twelve years has not returned since March 1950. According to the price statistics of 25 major commodities in 15 large and medium-sized cities across the country in 1950 by the Price Department of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, taking December 1949 as the base period equal to 100, the index for December 1950 was 193.2, with a full-year increase of less than one time. The base wholesale price index and monthly chain index of major commodities nationwide in 1950 are listed separately as follows:
    Table 1 is the fixed-base classification index of wholesale prices of 25 major commodities in 15 large and medium-sized cities across the country in 1950: (See attached chart)
    Note: (1) Including cities: Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan, Fuzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chongqing.
    (2) Including commodities: Food grains: flour, wheat, rice, corn, millet, sorghum, soybeans. Non-staple foods: cooking oil, edible salt, pork, white sugar, chicken eggs. Cotton yarn and cloth: raw cotton, 20-count yarn, white cloth, colored cloth. Fuels: coal, kerosene, gasoline. General merchandise: matches, vulcanized rubber shoes, soap, cigarettes, rubber tires, alkali.
    (3) The fixed-base index takes December 1949 as the base period equal to 100.
    (4) Calculation method: simple geometric average calculation method.
    From the changes in the above-mentioned annual wholesale price index, it can be seen that the trend of price development and changes in the country in 1950 can be roughly divided into three stages. January to March is the first stage. During this period, prices across the country were basically in a state of rising and unstable fluctuations. For example, the national average monthly chain index of wholesale prices rose by 27 percent in January compared with December 1949, rose by 59 percent in February compared with January, and also rose by 11 percent in March compared with February. Compared with the prices in December 1949, the prices in March rose by an average of 126 percent, of which fuels and general merchandise rose by 80 to 90 percent, while food grains and non-staple foods rose by 152 to 196 percent. This was mainly due to the increased sales of food grains and non-staple foods in the market during the New Year holidays, resulting in temporary imbalances in supply and demand.
    April to May is the second stage. During this period, with the unified management and leadership of national financial and economic work, the stability of currency, and the disappearance of false purchasing power formed in the long-term currency inflation and price fluctuations, prices across the country not only stopped rising but also reversed into a downward trend. Compared with March, national prices in May fell by an average of more than 30 percent, with the largest decline in April. Compared with March, the average decline in April was 25 percent. Looking at the classified price index, the food grains and non-staple foods, which had larger increases in the previous stage, also had larger declines than other categories during this period. Compared with March, the average price of food grains fell by 34 percent, and the average price of non-staple foods fell by 36 percent; general merchandise fell by 33 percent, and cotton yarn and cloth and fuels fell by about 25 percent.
    From June to December, over the seven months, after local governments vigorously adjusted industry and commerce, the nationwide bumper harvest of agricultural products and large-scale purchases of agricultural and native products by state-owned trading companies, the land reform and rent reduction and deposit refund movements in the vast new liberated areas, the increase in farmers' purchasing power, and the gradual improvement of market economic conditions in various places, the national prices, along with the active urban and rural economy, also entered a relatively stable state. Compared with June, national prices in December rose by an average of 24 percent. Looking at the monthly chain index, except for an average increase of 7.3 percent in July, the average increase ratio in other months was between 1 and 5 percent. During this period, although the prices of some commodities had some small fluctuations due to various temporary factors, they were all local and temporary small fluctuations. After the state-owned trading companies vigorously adjusted supply and demand in various places, coupled with the strengthening of market administrative management, each fluctuation was quickly stabilized. This is essentially different from the price fluctuations before March.
            II
    From the above-mentioned development and changes in national prices in 1950, it can be seen that since March, prices across the country have basically shifted from the long-term rise and fluctuation in the past to a gradual state of stability. Why, when the national liberation war has not yet completely ended and the extremely chaotic situation of currency inflation and price fluctuations left over by the Kuomintang reactionary clique's many years of sinful rule, could it be fundamentally changed and stabilized in less than half a year after the establishment of the Central People's Government?
    The first and fundamental reason is that the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure are close to balance, and fiscal issuance has basically stopped. In order to achieve a near balance of government fiscal revenue and expenditure and strive for the stability of national finance and prices, the State Council of the Central People's Government first issued the historically significant "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" on March 3, 1950. According to the spirit of this decision, after unifying national fiscal revenue and expenditure, unifying and reorganizing institutions and personnel, clearing warehouses, rectifying and increasing income, saving expenditures; unifying national state-owned trade work, unifying material allocation, establishing trade treasuries and cash management systems, and state-owned trade companies selling large quantities of goods and withdrawing currency, the national fiscal revenue and expenditure began to approach balance, and finance and prices gradually entered a stable state. This great victory on the economic front is the result of the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his report at the seventh meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on April 13: "At a time when the war has not yet completely ended, the national fiscal revenue and expenditure are close to balance. This should be thanked to the People's Liberation Army for their heroic fighting and rapid liberation of the Chinese mainland; thanks to the national military, government, public, and education staff, who work hard and live a hard life; especially to thank the people of the whole country for actively paying public grain, taxes, and purchasing public bonds. Without these joint efforts, it would be impossible to achieve a near balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure and relatively stable finance and prices."
    Secondly, state-owned trading companies vigorously regulated supply and demand, ensuring sufficient supply of major necessities for people's lives and major industrial raw materials. "Balancing revenue and expenditure, coupled with the unified management of finance and economy, has resulted in a stable financial situation throughout the country since March this year. The direct consequence is that a fundamental change has taken place in the price issue. That is to say, the factor of high prices caused by currency devaluation no longer exists. However, this only solves one aspect of the price problem, and it is also necessary to solve the other aspect of sufficient material supply in order to stabilize the prices that have fluctuated for twelve years." (See Vice Premier Chen Yun's article "The Situation of Finance and Economic Work in the People's Republic of China in the Past Year") In 1950, the quantity of major necessities for people's lives and major industrial raw materials such as grain, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, coal, edible salt, cotton, kerosene, and other general merchandise sold by state-owned trading companies in the market was quite large, of which grain alone was transferred and transported up to 5 billion jin nationwide. This is the largest-scale transfer and transportation in Chinese history. With the assistance of local people's governments, the supply and transfer of the above-mentioned major materials by state-owned trading companies not only stabilized the lives of the vast people and ensured price stability, but also severely cracked down on speculators who have been hoarding, speculating, and raising prices for their own selfish gains for many years.
    Thirdly, the recovery and development of production and transportation. Compared with 1949, in terms of agricultural production, the national (including the Northeast region) output of major crops increased by 10.8 percent, and cotton output increased by 58.9 percent; in terms of textile industry production, according to statistics from state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile mills in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Taiyuan, and the Northeast and Northwest regions, cotton cloth output increased by 68 percent, and cotton yarn output increased by 70.5 percent; in terms of fuel industry production, the coal output of state-owned coal mines (including the Northeast region) increased by 29 percent, crude oil output increased by 58.5 percent, gasoline output increased by 33 percent, and diesel output increased by 264 percent; in terms of major heavy industry production, according to incomplete statistics from January to October 1950, the total output value of the five categories of industry in the Northeast region, including steel, non-ferrous metals, machinery, electrical appliances, and chemicals, increased by 262 percent compared with the same period in 1949. Compared with the same period in the regions within the customs, non-ferrous metals increased by about 353 percent, chemicals increased by about 209 percent, and electrical appliances increased by about ten times; in terms of transportation, the recovery and development of railways, highways, sea transportation, and inland river transportation nationwide in 1950 also achieved great results; especially the improvement of railway transportation has created an unprecedented record in Chinese history. The recovery and development of all these industrial and agricultural production and transportation played a significant role in ensuring the supply and transfer of major living and production materials needed by the people of the whole country and ensuring price stability.
    Finally, the rational adjustment of public-private relations and production-sales relations. Since the May Conference of Industry and Commerce Bureau Directors last year, the People's Government has made its utmost efforts to adjust public-private relations and convened various professional meetings to adjust production-sales relations. Industrialists and businessmen across the country have full trust in all the government's measures. Especially after the Chinese People's Volunteers achieved great victories on the Korean battlefield, industrialists and businessmen across the country have successively issued declarations and formulated patriotic pacts to participate in the great mass movement of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending the Homeland" with practical actions such as ensuring the completion of tax payment, ensuring price stability, and ensuring the improvement of production. The patriotic actions of industrialists and businessmen in various places also played a positive guarantee role in consolidating the stability of national prices.
            III
    With the stabilization of national prices, not only has it greatly encouraged and guaranteed the normal recovery and development of various production undertakings in a planned way, facilitated the exchange of materials between various parts of the country, and stabilized the lives of the people of the whole country and the vast military, government, public, and education personnel, but also the credit of the Renminbi has been unprecedentedly improved and consolidated. Due to the consolidation of the value of the Renminbi, the circulation range of the Renminbi has gradually expanded. The phenomenon that the vast new liberated areas and rural areas of some old liberated areas mainly used silver dollars or in-kind goods as the main exchange medium has gradually decreased since March 1950, and has been replaced by the Renminbi as the main means of exchange. In addition, the circulation speed of currency in the market has also greatly decreased, and the storage function of currency has gradually recovered. In the long-term price fluctuations in the past, the storage function of currency had long been lost. After getting currency, no one wanted to save it, and they quickly bought it into goods for storage to prevent losses from currency devaluation. However, this psychology of "valuing goods over currency" has undergone a fundamental change in the stable financial and price situation, thus further ensuring price stability. In addition, with the stabilization of prices and the development and growth of state-owned trade, the nature of the domestic market has been fundamentally changed. The market that was manipulated by bureaucratic capital for speculation and played a role in undermining the people's economy in the past has been basically changed into a market under the leadership of the state-owned economy for the purpose of serving the people's lives and restoring and developing production.
    For twelve years, due to the destruction of the war and the inflation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the national prices have been in a state of skyrocketing and fluctuation; but only half a year after the establishment of the Central People's Government, when the national liberation war has not yet completely ended and various production and transportation undertakings are yet to be restored, the new situation of price stability that the people of the whole country have longed for for many years has been realized. This is precisely the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government and the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. This is not only a great happy event for the Chinese people, but also a rare achievement in the modern economic development history of various countries.
    We believe that in 1951, on the basis of the stability that has already been achieved in 1950, the national prices will continue to maintain a stable situation with the further improvement of the national financial and economic situation.

　　一九五零年全国物价概述
    杨波
            一
    一九五○年全国物价（不包括东北区，下同）发展变化的基本趋势，总括来说，是一、二、三月上涨，四、五月下落，六月份起大体稳定。十二年来的通货膨胀，物价猛涨的局面，自一九五○年三月以后，已经一去不复返了。据中央人民政府贸易部物价处一九五○年全国十五个大中城市二十五种主要商品的价格计算，以一九四九年十二月为基期等于一○○，则一九五○年十二月的指数为一九三．二，全年上涨不及一倍。兹将一九五○年全国主要商品批发物价定基指数与逐月环比指数分别列表如下：
    第一表是一九五○年全国十五个大中城市二十五种主要商品批发物价定基分类指数：（附图表）
    注：（一）包括城市，计：北京、天津、张家口、太原、上海、青岛、济南、福州、汉口、广州、长沙、南昌、西安、兰州、重庆。
    （二）包括商品，计：食粮类：面粉、小麦、大米、玉米、小米、红粮、大豆。副食品类：食油、食盐、猪肉、白糖、鸡子。花纱布类：皮棉、二十支纱、白细布、色布。燃料类：煤、煤油、汽油。百货类：火柴、硫化青、肥皂、纸烟、胶胎、碱面。
    （三）定基指数系以一九四九年十二月为基期等于一○○。
    （四）计算方法：系简单几何平均计算法。
    从上列全年批发物价指数的变化中，可以看出，一九五○年全国物价发展变化的趋势，大体上可以分为三个阶段。一至三月份为第一阶段。这一时期全国各地物价，基本上是处于上涨、波动不稳定的状态中，如全国批发物价逐月环比平均指数，一月份较一九四九年十二月份上涨了百分之二十七，二月份较一月份则上涨了百分之五十九，三月份较二月份亦上涨了百分之十一。如以三月份的物价与一九四九年十二月份的物价比较，则平均上涨了百分之一二六，其中燃料类与百货类上涨了百分之八十至九十，而食粮类与副食品类则上涨了百分之一五二至一九六。这主要是由于新旧年节期间市场食粮及副食品销量增多，一时供求失调所致。
    四至五月份为第二阶段。这一时期随着全国财政经济工作的统一管理和领导，通货的稳定，多年来在通货膨胀，物价波动中所形成的市场虚假购买力的消逝，全国各地物价，不但停止了上涨，而且逆转为下落的趋势，五月份与三月份比较，全国物价平均下落了百分之三十以上，其中以四月份下落幅度最大，四月份与三月份比较，平均下落了百分之二十五。如从分类物价指数上看，前一阶段上涨幅度较大的食粮类与副食品类，这一时期其下落的幅度亦较其它各类为大。五月份与三月份比较，食粮类的价格平均下落了百分之三十四，副食品类的价格平均下落了百分之三十六；百货类下落了百分之三十三，花纱布与燃料两类，下落了百分之二十五左右。
    从六月份起至十二月份的七个月中，经过各地政府大力调整工商业，全国农产丰收及国营贸易公司对农产品与土产品的大量收购，广大新解放区土地改革及减租退押运动的开展，农民购买力的提高，全国各地物价，随着各地市场经济情况的逐渐好转，城乡经济的活跃亦即步入比较稳定的状态。十二月份与六月份比较，全国各地物价平均上涨了百分之二十四，如从逐月环比指数上看，则除七月份平均上涨百分之七·三较多外，其余各月份的上涨比例平均都在百分之一至百分之五之间。这一时期虽曾有一部分商品的价格，由于各种不同的临时因素的影响，发生过一些小的波动，但都是局部的，临时性的小波动，经过各地国营贸易公司的大力调剂供求，配合以市场行政管理工作的加强，每次的波动都很快地平稳。这与三月份以前的物价波动，是有本质上的区别的。
            二
    从上述一九五○年全国物价的发展变化中，可以看出，全国各地物价自三月份以后，基本上已由过去长时期的上涨、波动而逐渐转入稳定的状态，为什么当全国解放战争尚未最后结束，国民党反动派多年罪恶统治所遗留下来的通货膨胀，物价波动的极端混乱的状况，在中央人民政府成立以后不到半年的时间，即可得到基本的改变、稳定呢？
    首先而基本的原因是，政府的财政收支已接近平衡，财政性的发行已基本停止。为了达到政府财政收支的接近平衡，争取全国金融、物价的稳定，中央人民政府政务院首先于一九五○年三月三日发布了有重大历史意义的“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”。根据这一决定的精神，经过统一全国财政收支，统一整编机构、人员，清理仓库，整顿增加收入，节省开支；统一全国国营贸易工作，统一物资调拨，建立贸易金库与现金管理制度，及国营贸易公司大量出售货物，回笼货币等措施，全国的财政收支即开始接近平衡，金融、物价即逐渐步入稳定的状态。这一经济战线上的伟大胜利，是全国人民共同努力的结果。陈云副总理四月十三日在中央人民政府委员会第七次会议上的报告中曾指出：“在战争还未完全结束的时候，国家财政收支已接近平衡，这应该感谢人民解放军英勇作战，迅速解放了中国大陆；感谢全国军政公教职工，他们努力工作，而过着艰苦的生活；尤其要感谢全国人民踊跃交纳公粮，税收和购买公债。没有这些共同努力，要达到财政收支接近平衡，金融物价比较稳定，是不可能的。”
    其次，国营贸易公司大力调节供求，保证了人民生活主要必需物资及主要工业原料的充分供应。“平衡了收支，又加上财政经济的统一管理，这样就使得今年三月以来，在全国范围内出现了金融稳定的局面。其直接的后果是：物价问题上，有了一个根本性质的改变。就是说，由通货贬值而来的物价高涨的因素，已经不存在了。但是，这还只解决了物价问题的一个方面，还必须解决充分的物资供应另一个方面，才能把波动了十二年的物价稳定下来。”（见陈云副总理《中华人民共和国过去一年财政和经济工作的状况》一文）一九五○年各地国营贸易公司在市场上出售的粮食、棉布、棉纱、煤炭、食盐、棉花、煤油及其它百货等人民生活主要必需物资与主要工业原料的数量，是相当大的，其中仅粮食一项，即在全国范围内调运了达五十亿斤。这是中国有史以来最大规模的一次调运。国营贸易公司在各地人民政府的协助下，对上述主要物资的供应、调运，不但安定了广大人民的生活，保证了物价的稳定，而且对多年来专事囤积居奇，哄抬物价而渔利自肥的投机者，亦给予了严重的打击。
    再次，生产与交通事业的恢复、发展。一九五○年与一九四九年比较，在农业生产方面，全国（包括东北区）主要农作物的粮食产量增加了百分之一○·八，棉花产量增加了百分之五八·九；纺织工业生产方面，根据上海、天津、青岛、太原四市，东北与西北两区国营及公私合营棉纺织厂的统计，棉布产量增加了百分之六十八，棉纱产量增加了百分之七○·五；燃料工业生产方面，国营煤矿的煤炭产量（包括东北区）增加了百分之二十九，原油产量增加了百分之五八·五，汽油产量增加了百分之三十三，柴油产量增加了百分之二六四；主要重工业生产方面，根据一九五○年一至十月份不完全的统计，东北区钢铁、有色金属、机器、电器和化工五类工业的生产总值，较一九四九年同期增加了百分之二六二，关内各区同时期相比，有色金属约增加了百分之三五三，化工增加了约为百分之二○九，电器则增加约达十倍；在交通运输方面，一九五○年全国铁路、公路、海运、内河航运等恢复与发展，也都有很大的成绩；尤其是铁路运输的改进，已创造了中国历史上的空前纪录。这一切工农业生产与交通运输事业的恢复、发展，对保证全国人民所需主要生活及生产资料的供应、调运，保证物价的稳定，发挥了重大的作用。
    最后，公私关系、产销关系的合理调整。从去年五月工商局长会议以后，人民政府即以最大的努力来调整公私关系，并召开各种专业会议来调整产销关系。全国工商业家对政府的一切措施已经有了充分的信任。尤其当中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上取得重大胜利后，全国各地工商业者都纷纷发表宣言，订立爱国公约，以保证完成纳税，保证稳定物价，保证搞好生产等实际行动参加了“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的伟大群众运动。各地工商业者这种爱国主义的行动，对巩固全国物价的稳定，亦起着积极的保证作用。
            三
    随着全国物价的稳定，不但大大鼓励与保证了各种生产事业得以有计划地正常地恢复与发展，便利了全国各地之间的物资交流，安定了全国人民与广大军政公教人员的生活，而且人民币的信用亦空前地提高与巩固了。由于人民币币值的巩固，人民币的流通范围已逐渐扩大，过去广大新解放区与部分老解放区的农村，以银元或实物为主要交换媒介的现象，自一九五○年三月份以后已逐渐减少，而代之以人民币为主要交换手段。此外，市场上货币的流通速度亦大大降低，货币的储藏作用已逐渐恢复。在过去长时期的物价波动中，货币的储藏作用早已丧失，人们在拿到货币后，谁也不愿保存，很快即买成货物储存，以防止货币贬值的损失，但这种“重货轻币”的心理，已在金融、物价稳定的情况下，起了基本的变化，因而更加保证了物价的稳定。此外，随着物价的稳定，国营贸易工作的发展壮大，国内市场的性质已基本改变，过去在官僚资本操纵下的以投机为目的，并起着败坏人民经济作用的市场，已经基本上改变为在国营经济领导下的以服务于人民生活与恢复及发展生产为目的的市场了。
    十二年来，由于战争的破坏和国民党反动政府通货膨胀的结果，全国的物价，一直是处于暴涨、波动的状态中；但自中央人民政府成立以后仅仅半年的时间，在全国解放战争尚未最后结束，各种生产与交通事业尚待恢复的时候，全国人民多年来所渴望的物价稳定的新局面即得以实现，这正是毛主席及中央人民政府英明领导及全国人民共同努力的结果。这不但对中国人民来讲，是一件天大的喜事，即在近代各国经济发展史上来看，也可以说是一件罕见的业迹。
    我们相信，一九五一年全国的物价，在一九五○年业已获得的稳定的基础上，随着全国财政经济状况进一步的好转，仍将继续保持着稳定的局面。
