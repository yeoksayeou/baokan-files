Editor's Note: The author of this article is the author of the film "Pastoral Song of Northern Shaanxi". The original title was "I Love Northern Shaanxi," and this title is the original subtitle. This film will be released on the tenth of this month.

　　In my daily interactions with comrades, I often have the feeling that those who have never been to Northern Shaanxi yearn for it; those who have been to Northern Shaanxi miss it. I lived in Northern Shaanxi for a period of time, and after leaving, I often thought of it.

　　Northern Shaanxi is a plateau, with loess hills occupying almost all the land. The farmers there tilt their bodies to cultivate the slopes, seeking food from the barren loess. Before the revolution, the farmers of Northern Shaanxi lived in extreme poverty, like serfs in old Russia; without freedom, only hardship and hunger.

　　The harsh reality of life tempered the people of Northern Shaanxi, and their character is stubborn. The people of Northern Shaanxi are not afraid of hardship, and they will live even in extremely difficult conditions; they have a strong vitality and are full of the courage to fight.

　　I love the mountains of Northern Shaanxi, I love the water of Northern Shaanxi, and I love even more the stubborn character of the people of Northern Shaanxi.

　　Northern Shaanxi has many folk songs, such as "Shun Tian You" and "The East is Red," and countless others have been collected. The people of Northern Shaanxi not only know how to sing but also how to compose songs. Before the old folk songs are finished, new folk songs have already been composed.

　　When the farmers of Northern Shaanxi drive their donkeys home after delivering public grain, they all straddle the backs of their donkeys, singing their favorite folk songs spontaneously. At this time, you would think they are all poets who can speak extemporaneously, forgetting that they are also hardworking farmers.

　　Whether before or after the revolution, the folk songs of Northern Shaanxi are full of optimism and upward spirit. They humorously scold the landlords, gentry, and warlords. They boldly sing of the revolutionary leaders, sing of their new life, and sing of the hope for the future.

　　Northern Shaanxi folk songs add a poetic color to the stubborn people of Northern Shaanxi: they are open-minded, they are humorous; they use laughter, song, and poetry to fight against the enemies who hinder their progress. Even when the struggle fails, they will use songs to encourage people to reorganize the struggle.

　　Northern Shaanxi folk songs encouraged the people of the past, and they are encouraging the people of the present, and they will also encourage the people of the future. I love the stubborn people of Northern Shaanxi, and I also love the optimistic and upward Northern Shaanxi folk songs.

　　Every person's experience in Northern Shaanxi can be written into a novel of different lengths, because the people of Northern Shaanxi have gone through various struggles. The oldest people can talk about their struggles against grain levies and taxes and their strikes against farming. The next oldest can talk about their Great Revolution struggles, or they can talk about their underground "doing red" struggles. Middle-aged people talk about how to join the Red Guards, how to join the Red Third Regiment...

　　I will never forget: when the sun was setting, the Yan River flowed slowly, and I, along with an old melon-watching man, squatted under the melon shed by the Yan River, listening to him tell the story of the land revolution.

　　He talked about the revolutionary martyrs Liu Zhidan and Xie Zichang, and he also talked about the revolutionary heroes Gao Gang and Xi Zhongxun. Finally, he told me the love story of a young peasant who joined the Red Army and a "female propagandist" who participated in the revolution. The deeds of these heroic figures are deeply imprinted in my mind. I respect them, and I miss them. Some of these heroic figures have already sacrificed, and some are still alive. Whether dead or alive, their heroic deeds will surely shine like the sun forever.

　　Heroes are not special people. Our heroes are all ordinary people from Northern Shaanxi. The martyrs used their lives to write brilliant epics, and the heroes used their blood to open up a smooth and solid revolutionary road.

　　The deeds of the heroes encourage me. I love the revolutionary history of Northern Shaanxi.

　　The people of Northern Shaanxi, the folk songs of Northern Shaanxi, and the history of Northern Shaanxi moved me; I want to introduce what I know about Northern Shaanxi to my friends, whether they have been to Northern Shaanxi or not.

　　On the second day of the first lunar month in 1950, I arrived in Northern Shaanxi for the third time. In the wind and sand, I visited the "Hometown" that Comrade Li Ji arranged for "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." Here is the scenery of the borderlands, with rolling yellow sand, like waves and tides. Mongolian steeds gallop down from the boundless sandy ridges, reminding people of the urgent messengers of the land revolution era. In the wind and sand, you can often see the "fortresses" used by the landlords to prevent the Red Army from attacking. Now that the revolution has been victorious, these "fortresses" are exposed to the sun like the ruins of history, reminding people that these ruins once tried their best to extinguish the flames of revolution, but it was they themselves who were extinguished instead.

　　Coming out of the Sanbian Desert, I entered the steep Red Stone Mountains. This is the hometown of the revolutionary martyr Liu Zhidan. With a special sense of admiration, I looked at all the scenery. There were countless stone caves carved into the cliffs and rocks, and I didn’t understand what these stone caves were used for. Inquiring of the old farmer, he said that they were used for counter-"encirclement". If the White Army came to "encircle and suppress" the Red Army, the heroes and brave people would immediately enter the stone caves, shooting at the enemy from the cliffs, and the enemy would have no choice but to carry the dead bodies and run away.

　　If these historical sites are linked to Liu Zhidan's revolutionary activities, it immediately reminds me of a term: "grassroots hero." Is Liu Zhidan a "grassroots hero"? No, definitely not. The land revolution movement in Northern Shaanxi was led by the Chinese Communist Party, and Liu Zhidan was a key figure in the leadership at that time. He was most familiar with the situation in Northern Shaanxi, and he knew how to use Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Communist Party triumphed in Northern Shaanxi, and the people of Northern Shaanxi triumphed.

　　The dark and miserable era will never return. What remains for us are countless great poems, which tell us how to live and also tell us how to fight for a better life.

　　The old lady who let me stay said to me: "These days didn't come easily!" Yes, a good life is by no means easy to come by, let us savor the history of land reform here.

　　This is not the entire history, it is only an episode in history.

　　As the conclusion of this short article, I want to state to the readers that I originally wanted to put "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" on the screen, but because of my own lack of ability, I changed it again and again into the current "Pastoral Song of Northern Shaanxi."

### 关于影片“陕北牧歌”的写作动机

　　关于影片“陕北牧歌”的写作动机
    编者按：本文作者就是影片《陕北牧歌》的作者。原题《我爱陕北》，本题是原来的副题。这部影片将在本月十日公映。
    在日常和同志们的接触中，我常常有这样的感觉：没有去过陕北的人，向往着陕北；曾经去过陕北的人，怀念着陕北。我在陕北生活过一个时期，离开陕北以后，我也常常想念着陕北。
    陕北是高原，黄土山几乎占据了所有的地面，那里的农民倾斜着身体在山坡上耕种，从贫瘠的黄土里寻求食物。革命以前，陕北农民生活在极端贫困中，像旧俄的农奴一样；没有自由，只有苦役和饥饿。
    残酷的现实生活锻炼了陕北人民，他们的性格是倔强的。陕北人不怕艰苦，就是在极端困难的条件下，他们也会生活下去；他们有着坚强的生命力，充满了战斗的勇气。
    我爱陕北的山，我爱陕北的水，我更爱陕北人民的倔强性格。
    陕北多民歌，诸如《顺天游》啊，《东方红》啊，收集起来不知有多少。陕北人不仅会唱歌，而且会编歌，旧的民歌还没有唱完，新的民歌早已编出来了。
    当陕北农民吆着毛驴送完公粮回家时，他们全都斜跨在毛驴背上，信口唱着自己喜爱的民歌，这时候，你会以为他们全都是出口成章的诗人，而忘了他们同时也是辛勤劳作的农民。
    不论在革命以前或者革命以后，陕北民歌里都充满了乐观向上的情绪。他们诙谐地笑骂着地主豪绅和军阀，他们豪放地歌唱着革命领袖，歌唱着自己的新生活，歌唱着未来的希望。
    陕北民歌给倔强的陕北人加上了诗一般的色彩：他们达观，他们幽默；他们用笑用歌用诗去对抗那阻碍他们前进的敌人。甚至在斗争失败了的时候，他们也会用歌来鼓舞人重新组织斗争。
    陕北民歌鼓励了过去的人，也鼓励着现在的人，它还要鼓励那未来的人。我热爱倔强的陕北人民，我也热爱那乐观向上的陕北民歌。
    每个陕北人的经历都可以写成一篇长短不同的小说，因为陕北人都经过了各种不同的斗争。最老的人可以讲他的抗粮抗税和罢农斗争。次老的人可以讲他的大革命斗争，也可以讲他的暗中“闹红”斗争，中年人讲怎么参加赤卫军，怎么参加红三团………
    我永远也不会忘记：当夕阳西下的时候，延河缓缓地流着，我和一个看瓜的老汉，蹲坐在延河边的瓜棚下，听他讲土地革命的故事。
    他讲到了革命的先烈刘志丹和谢子长，他也讲到了革命英雄高岗和习仲勋，最后他给我讲了参加红军的青年农民和参加革命的“女宣传”的恋爱故事。这些英雄人物的事迹深深地印在我的脑海里，我尊敬他们，想念他们。这些英雄人物有的已经牺牲了，有的依然健在。不管死去的也好，活着的也好，他们的英雄业迹一定会像太阳一样地永远发着光芒。
    英雄不是特殊的人。我们的英雄都是平凡的陕北人。先烈们用生命写下了光辉灿烂的史诗，英雄们用鲜血开拓出平稳坚实的革命道路来。
    英雄的事迹鼓舞着我，我热爱陕北的革命历史。
    陕北的人民，陕北的民歌，陕北的历史，激动了我；我想把我所认识的陕北，介绍给我那些朋友们，不论是去过陕北的人或者是没有去过陕北的人。
    一九五○年阴历元旦第二天，我第三次到了陕北。在风沙中，我访问了李季同志给《王贵与李香香》所安配的《家乡》，这里是塞外风光，黄沙滚滚，如浪如潮。蒙古骏马从漫无边际的沙梁上飞驰下来，使人联想到土地革命时代的报急使者。风沙中，常常可以看到地主们用以防止红军进攻的“寨子”。如今革命胜利了，这些“寨子”像历史的残骸般地暴露在阳光下，使人想到这些残骸曾经费尽心血地想扑灭革命的火焰，但是被扑灭的反是他自己。
    从三边沙漠中出来，我走进了峻峭的红石山中。这是革命先烈刘志丹的家乡，我以特别敬仰的心情，瞻望着所有的景物，绝壁石岩上凿有无数石窑，我不懂这些石窑干什么用的。询问老农，他说这是反“围剿”用的。如果白军来“围剿”红军，英雄和英勇的人民，一下子进了石窑，凭着绝壁向敌人射击，而敌人则毫无办法，只好抬着死尸滚蛋。
    这些古迹如果和刘志丹的革命活动连系起来，使我立刻想起了一个名词：“草莽英雄”。刘志丹是“草莽英雄”吗？不是的，绝不是的，陕北的土地革命运动是中国共产党所领导的，刘志丹就是当时一个领导的中坚人物。他最熟习陕北情况，他会运用马列主义，因之，共产党在陕北胜利了，陕北人民胜利了。
    黑暗和悲惨的时代永远不会再回来了，留给我们的是无数伟大的诗篇，这些诗篇告诉我们如何去生活，也告诉我们为了美好的生活如何去斗争。
    留我住宿的老太太对我说：“这日子来的不容易啊！”是的，好生活来的绝非容易，让我们在这里回味一下土地改革的历史吧。
    这不是整个的历史，这只是历史的一段插曲。
    作为这篇短文的收尾，我要向读者申明一下，原来我是要把“王贵与李香香”映上银幕的，但是因为自己的能力不强，改来改去改成了现在的“陕北牧歌”。
                                 一九五○、三、二、夜、北京
