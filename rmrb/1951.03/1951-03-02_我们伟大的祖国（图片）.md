    Our Great Motherland
    Our country's famous bamboo suspension bridge, located in Guanxian, Sichuan, spans the Min River for more than 320 meters. The bamboo cables are made of many bamboo strips woven together, with planks laid on top to form the walking surface, and bamboo cables are also used as railings on both sides. This is one of the ingenious creations in ancient Chinese architectural engineering.
