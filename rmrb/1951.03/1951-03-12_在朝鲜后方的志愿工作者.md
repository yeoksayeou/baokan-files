　　Volunteer Workers Behind the Korean Front Lines
　　By Our Correspondent Zhang Rong'an

　　Behind the Korean front lines, you can see tens of thousands of outstanding Chinese sons and daughters fighting for the security of the motherland and world peace. They are supporting the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea with unparalleled enthusiasm.

　　As the sun sets, all great activities begin. Trucks loaded with war materials speed along winding and rugged roads. The long streams of people – volunteer stretcher teams and transport teams, dragging sleds, carrying stretchers, and pushing rubber-wheeled carts – rush to the front.

　　When the volunteer motorcade first arrived in Korea, they were unfamiliar with the terrain and lacked air defense equipment, which caused some difficulties and losses. However, they brought collective creativity into play and quickly overcame these difficulties. They bravely and resourcefully dealt with enemy air raids. On dark nights, dozens of miles were brightly lit. When enemy planes attacked, an alarm would sound, and the lights would go out, causing the enemy planes to lose their targets. On moonlit nights, excellent battlefield drivers could drive without lights. The enemy planes could only fly aimlessly in the air. A certain motor vehicle regiment operated safely for a month without suffering any losses. A certain vehicle of this regiment, thanks to the bravery and resourcefulness of the driver, suffered seven enemy air raids in one day without suffering any damage. Enemy planes attempted to hinder the advance of vehicles by dropping time bombs on the road, but the heroic drivers selflessly picked up the bombs and threw them into the gullies.

　　On a clear, moonlit night, I met a volunteer transport team unloading supplies at a transportation station. The dark mass of people moved forward urgently. Sleds squeaked as they pressed through the snow. Under the moonlight and snow, clusters of people crossed endless mountains and rushed to the front. Everyone's mouth was steaming, and the steam quickly formed ice on their eyebrows and beards. During the tense rush, an alarm sounded, and enemy planes came. However, the heroic transport team members immediately dragged their sleds forward when the enemy planes flashed overhead, and lay down again when the enemy planes were above them. When the enemy planes left, they immediately started a transportation competition. In this way, after a night of intense labor, countless tons of ammunition were transported to the front.

　　At an awards ceremony, I met members of the Fushun cart team from Liaodong Province. They were all peasants who had been emancipated through land reform. To protect their good times, they drove carts and volunteered to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Their achievement was completing three emergency transportation tasks without suffering any losses. Team leader Liang Changli, a young man in his early twenties wearing a long-haired fur hat and the blue trousers commonly worn by Northeasterners, told me a simple account of the three emergency transports. The first emergency transport was completed without ever having been to Korea, only knowing the name of a destination, and without guides or translators. The second and third emergency transports were completed under continuous enemy air raids and a lack of food and grass. When they set out for the third emergency transport, they arrived at the designated location, but the troops had moved. They traveled more than 400 li more than the planned distance. There wasn't enough food or grass, so they fed the animals until they were full, and they went without sleep for three days and two nights to catch up with the troops. He said: "As long as the soldiers at the front have enough to eat and wear and can eliminate the American devils, we don't mind suffering a little hardship." Because of their perseverance, resilience, and collective wisdom, they overcame difficulties and successfully completed the task. A certain unit awarded them a bright red flag.

　　I met a military representative of the Volunteer Army who lived in a basement one meter wide and about thirty meters long. From dinner time until the next morning, he worked to solve all the big and small problems of all military personnel and logistics personnel passing through here, such as eating and walking. Hundreds of tons of supplies passed through here every day to the front. Heroic, wounded Volunteer Army soldiers also passed through here to the rear. In a small room in the basement separated by wooden boards, there were six young women from Northeast China. They guarded a telephone switchboard under bright gas lamps. Although American planes harassed them from time to time, they calmly carried out their tasks like well-trained soldiers, without stopping work for a moment. Here, I interviewed one of them, Comrade Qin Meilan. She was from Haicheng County, Liaodong Province, and her father was a railway worker. She had a younger brother and a younger sister, all of whom were studying at school. She worked at the Qiqihar Telecommunications Section. Now the family's life is quite prosperous. During the puppet Manchurian rule, her family's life was painful. Therefore, she dropped out of school after studying in higher primary school for a year. After liberation, her father's salary increased, and she also found a job, so the family's life gradually became prosperous. She said: When the flames of the American imperialist aggression against Korea spread to the border of the motherland, and American bombs fell on the land of her hometown, she recalled the past miserable life and decided to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. She wrote a letter of determination, requesting to go to Korea. She said: Before coming here, she was mentally prepared to endure extreme hardship and to complete the task under any difficulties and dangers. But after coming here, the actual life was not as serious as she imagined. Every day she could eat sorghum rice and dried potatoes, and sometimes she could even eat rice. Speaking of this, her spirit seemed so full. These young men and women working tensely and selflessly in the war, like the young people in China, sang "Singing for Chairman Mao" and "We Workers Have Strength" from their residences every night. These familiar songs of the great motherland fully expressed their joy in fighting for the security of the motherland and world peace.

### 在朝鲜后方的志愿工作者

　　在朝鲜后方的志愿工作者
    本报记者  张荣安
    在朝鲜的后方，可以看到成千成万为祖国的安全和世界的和平而战斗的中国优秀儿女。他们正以无比的热情支援着抗美战争的前线。
    当夕阳西下的时候，一切伟大的活动就开始了。载满战争物资的卡车在蜿蜒崎岖的公路上奔驰。漫长的人流——志愿担架队和运输队，拖着雪橇，扛着担架，赶着胶皮轮车，奔赴前线。
    志愿汽车队刚到朝鲜时，地理生疏，没有防空装置，曾遭受到一些困难和损失；但他们发挥了集体的创造性，很快就克服了这些困难。他们勇敢而机智地应付着敌机的袭击。在黑暗的夜里，一望数十里灯火辉煌。敌机来袭时，一声警报，灯火齐灭，使敌机失去袭击的目标。在月明的夜里，优秀的战地司机，用不着开灯即可行车。敌机只好在空中茫然地飞行。某部汽车团安全运行了一个月，未遭受一点损失。该团一部汽车，由于司机的勇敢与机智，一天里曾遭受敌机七次袭击而未受任何损失。敌机妄图阻滞汽车前进，在公路上丢下定时炸弹，但英勇的司机奋不顾身地把炸弹抱起来扔到山沟里去。
    一个月白风清的夜里，在一个交通站上我碰到正在卸运物资的志愿运输队。黑压压的人流，急促地向前移动着。雪橇压着积雪嗤嗤的作响。在月雪辉映下，一簇一簇的人群，越过无尽的山峦奔向前线。每个人的口里冒着热气，热气很快又在眉毛胡子上结成了冰块。正在紧张抢运的时候，警报枪响了，敌机来了。但英勇的运输队员们，当敌机一闪过头顶时，就立即拖着雪橇前进；敌机到头上时又重新卧倒。敌机逸去时，立即展开运输竞赛。就这样经过一个晚间的紧张劳动，才把无数吨弹药运往前方。
    在一个奖功大会上，我遇到了辽东省抚松大车队的队员们。他们都是经过土地改革翻身的农民，为了保卫自己的好时光，赶着大车，志愿前来支援抗美战争。他们的功绩是三次完成抢运任务，而没有受到任何损失。队长梁昌礼，一个二十岁上下的青年，戴着一顶长毛的大皮帽，穿着东北人惯穿的青色马裤，他告诉了我三次抢运的简单经过。第一次抢运任务是在根本没到过朝鲜，只知道一个目的地的地名，也没向导和翻译的情况下完成的。第二次和第三次抢运，是在敌机连续袭扰又缺乏粮草的情况下完成的。当他们第三次出发抢运时，赶到了指定地点，部队又转移了。他们往返超过预定路程四百多里，粮草不够了，叫牲口吃饱，他们三夜两夜没睡觉才赶上部队。他说：“只要前线战士吃饱穿暖，能消灭美国鬼子，我们受点委曲是没有关系的。”由于他们坚忍顽强，发挥集体的智慧，克服困难，就很好地完成了任务，某部奖给他们一面鲜艳的大红旗。
    我见到一位志愿军的军事代表，他住在一个宽一公尺、长约三十公尺的地下室里，从吃晚饭起，一直工作到次日的早晨，负责解决从这里过往的一切军事人员和后勤人员吃饭走路等大大小小的问题。数百吨的物资，每天都从这里经过运往前方。英勇负伤的志愿军战士，也经过这里到后方去。另在地下室一个用木板隔成的小房间里，有六位从东北来的女青年。她们在明亮的瓦斯灯下，守着一部电话交换台。虽然美机不时地在她们头上袭扰，但她们像久经锻炼的战士一样，沉着地执行着自己的任务，没有片刻停止工作。在这里我访问了其中的一位秦梅兰同志。她是辽东省海城县人，父亲是一位铁路职员。有一个弟弟一个妹妹，全在学校读书。她在齐齐哈尔电务段工作。现在家庭生活相当富裕。在伪满统治时代，她的家庭生活是痛苦的。因此，她念了一年高小就失学了。解放后父亲的薪水增加了，她自己也找到了一个职业，家庭生活才渐渐富裕起来。她说：当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争的火焰燃烧到祖国的边疆，美国炸弹落到她自己故乡的土地上时，她又回想起了过去的悲惨生活，决心要参加抗美援朝的战争。她写下了决心书，要求到朝鲜来。她说：在未来以前，思想上准备经受极大的艰苦，要在任何困难和危险的情况下完成任务。但来到之后，实际生活却没有想像的那么严重。每天能吃到高粱米和土豆干，有时还能吃到大米。说到这里她的精神显得那样充沛。这些在战争中紧张忘我工作的青年男女和在中国的青年人一样，每天晚上从她们的住地发出“歌唱毛主席”，“我们工人有力量”的歌声，这熟悉的伟大祖国的歌声，充分地表现了她们为祖国安全为世界和平而战斗的快乐。
