　　Xinhua News Agency Statement
    The US Group's Slander That I Am "Peddling Opium" in Hong Kong is Pure Malicious Rumor Attempting to Cover Up Acts of Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] On February 27th, at the 12th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, under the manipulation of US imperialism, and despite the opposition of representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, an illegal resolution was passed slandering the Chinese government for "peddling opium" in Hong Kong and deciding to conduct an investigation. Xinhua News Agency is instructed to declare: This unfounded and malicious fabrication is not worth refuting. It can only give the impression that the US imperialists and their accomplices have become so desperate as to attempt to divert people's attention with such base and vile rumors, and to cover up the acts of aggression they are currently carrying out. At the same time, this once again proves that the United Nations organization, under the control of the US imperialist group, has become an instrument of aggression for the US imperialists.

　　新华通讯社奉令声明
    美国集团污蔑我在香港“兜售鸦片”纯系恶意造谣企图掩饰侵略行为
    【新华社九日讯】二月二十七日联合国经济暨社会理事会第十二届会议在美帝国主义操纵下，不顾苏联、捷克、波兰代表的反对，通过一项非法决议，污蔑中国政府在香港“兜售鸦片”，并决定进行调查。新华通讯社顷奉令声明：这种毫无根据的恶意的捏造，不值一驳。它只能给人以一种印象，即：美帝国主义者及其帮凶们，竟穷极无聊到这种程度，企图以这种卑鄙与下流的谣言来转移人们的注视，掩饰它们自己所正进行的侵略行为。同时，这也再一次证明联合国机构在美帝国主义集团操纵之下，已经变成美帝国主义者的侵略工具。
