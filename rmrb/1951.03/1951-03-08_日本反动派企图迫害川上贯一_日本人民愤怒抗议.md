Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: According to a United Press report: The Japanese people are expressing extreme indignation and protesting against the attempt by the Japanese reactionaries, manipulating the Diet, to illegally deprive Japanese Communist Party member Kanzaki Kawakami of his Diet seat. Kanzaki Kawakami was referred to the Diet's Disciplinary Committee for his statement on January 27th in the House of Representatives, representing the Communist Party, condemning the Yoshida government's traitorous policies, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.

In the Osaka electoral district that elected Kanzaki Kawakami, more than 200 representatives from the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party Reconstruction Faction, labor unions, students, and women held a meeting under the slogan "Defend Our Diet Member" entitled "Overall Peace Treaty, Oppose Punishing Diet Member Kanzaki Kawakami." The meeting resolved to send telegrams to the Speaker of the House and the Disciplinary Committee to express their protest, and to send a telegram to Kanzaki Kawakami to express their condolences.

Many progressive cultural figures have issued statements protesting the Diet's measures. Lawyer Tatsuji Fuse said: Kawakami's punishment means that the parliament has suffered further punishment, that is, "the suicide of an inferior parliament." Yasushi Hayakawa, Associate Professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, said: In order to defend freedom of speech, I oppose the punishment of Diet member Kanzaki Kawakami. Critic Itaru Araya said: "If nothing can be said in the Diet, what will it become?" Film critic Akira Iwasaki believes that "we must crush this conspiracy with the voice of the masses."

　　日本反动派企图迫害川上贯一
    日本人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社六日讯】据联合通讯社讯：日本人民对于日本反动派操纵下的国会阴谋非法剥夺日共议员川上贯一议席的企图，表示极大愤慨，并为此发出抗议。川上贯一由于一月二十七日在众议院代表共产党发表谴责吉田政府卖国政策，反对重新武装日本，要求缔结全面和约的声明，已被国会决议送交惩罚委员会处理。
    在选出川上贯一的大阪选区，共产党、劳农党、社会党再建派、工会、学生及妇女代表二百余人，在“保卫我们的议员”的口号下举行了“全面媾和、反对惩罚川上贯一议员”的会议。会议决议致电众院议长及惩罚委员会表示抗议，并致电川上贯一表示慰问。
    许多进步文化人士纷纷发表谈话，抗议国会的措施。律师布施辰治说：川上的受惩罚，意味着议会受了更进一步的惩罚，就是“自卑国会的自杀”。东京工业大学副教授早川康?说：为了保卫言论自由，我反对惩罚川上贯一议员。评论家新居格说：“国会中任何话都不能说，它又将成为什么？”电影评论家岩崎昶认为“一定要以大众的呼声来粉碎这个阴谋”。
