The "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" have been officially promulgated by the Government Administration Council and will be implemented starting March 1st. This is a great achievement for the Chinese working class and one of the important political tasks of the current Chinese workers' movement. The implementation of these regulations will undoubtedly further encourage and consolidate the patriotic production emulation campaign of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, which is being carried out among workers nationwide. In order to undertake the glorious task of implementing the labor insurance cause, trade union organizations at all levels must be responsible for completing the following preparatory work before April 20th:

(1) Propaganda Work for the Implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations

Trade union organizations at all levels, especially municipal federations of trade unions, and grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines, should immediately convene various meetings, such as representative meetings, celebration meetings, symposiums, and lectures, to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work among the masses of workers and staff. Explain the significance of implementing labor insurance and the specific methods, and organize the masses to discuss them separately, all the way down to each workshop group. At the meetings, workers, especially veteran workers and female workers, can be organized to recall the various tragic situations they encountered under the reactionary rule when they were oppressed and exploited and when they encountered events such as birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability. Use these concrete facts to educate the broad masses of workers, so that they can understand how the Communist Party and the People's Government care about the lives of the workers, and thus understand that only by supporting and consolidating our Party and the people's political power can our material and cultural lives be gradually improved. In this way, we can raise the class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the working masses and further develop the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the labor emulation movement. At the same time, it is necessary to explain in detail the various treatment methods of the labor insurance regulations, so that the broad masses of workers, staff, and workers can understand the relationship between this system and their own personal interests, and thus care about and participate in the implementation of these regulations. This is the most important key to ensuring the correct implementation and thorough implementation of the labor insurance regulations.

(2) Application for Registration Certificates and Filing for Implementation of Labor Insurance Regulations

(1) All grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines that should implement labor insurance according to Article 2, Section A of the Labor Insurance Regulations must, before March 15th, discuss and decide with the administrative side or the capitalists at the factory management committee or labor-capital consultation meeting, and jointly apply to the local people's government labor administrative organ for registration for the implementation of labor insurance, and should immediately report in writing to the higher-level trade union organization level by level to the labor insurance department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for filing (this report should specify the factory and mine name, address, number of employees, total wages for January of this year, etc.). If it is difficult for the factory or mine to maintain due to special economic difficulties or has not yet formally started operations, and the trade union and the administrative side or the capitalists agree to postpone implementation, or if the original total amount of labor insurance benefits exceeds the total amount of benefits in these regulations, and therefore both parties agree to maintain the original benefits and not implement these regulations, they should jointly apply to the local people's government labor administrative organ for approval for filing. If the two parties fail to reach a consensus on whether or not to implement it, they should submit it to the local people's government labor administrative organ for handling.

(2) The national committees of trade unions for railways, postal services, telecommunications, and ordnance should, before March 15th, jointly apply with the administrative side to the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government for registration for the implementation of labor insurance. After registration, they should immediately report in writing to the labor insurance department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for filing. Their subordinate local organizations and grassroots organizations will no longer register with the local labor administrative organs.

(3) Holding Labor Insurance Training Classes

(1) Trade union organizations in each province and city should open labor insurance training classes before the end of March. Trainees must include cadres in grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines that implement labor insurance according to the conditions who are responsible for labor insurance work. The teaching materials should focus on the Labor Insurance Regulations, Implementing Rules, General Rules for Labor Insurance Committees, and instructions for card registration. The teaching methods must focus on explanation, discussion, and practical exercises such as card registration.

(2) The national committees of the four industrial trade unions of railways, postal services, telecommunications, and coal mines may hold training classes centrally or instruct their subordinate local organizations to hold labor insurance training classes. Grassroots organizations of factories and enterprises affiliated with other industrial trade unions should participate in labor insurance training classes held by local trade unions.

(4) Establishing Labor Insurance Committees in Grassroots Trade Union Organizations

All grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines that have been registered to implement the Labor Insurance Regulations should establish labor insurance committees before the end of March in accordance with the General Rules for the Organization of Labor Insurance Committees issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and should immediately report the candidates to the higher-level trade union organization level by level to the labor insurance department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for filing.

(5) Establishing Financial Review Committees in Grassroots Trade Union Organizations

All grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines that have been registered to implement the Labor Insurance Regulations should establish financial review committees before the end of March in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Financial Review Committees at All Levels of Trade Unions, which were promulgated and implemented on a trial basis by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on August 4th of last year. These committees will be responsible for reviewing the monthly income and expenditure accounts of the labor insurance fund and various expenses directly paid by the administrative side or the capitalists, and will publicize them to the masses of workers and staff.

(6) Employee Registration Work for the Implementation of Labor Insurance Regulations

All grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines that have been registered to implement the Labor Insurance Regulations should, before April 20th, carry out labor insurance registration for all workers and staff in accordance with the Implementing Rules for Labor Insurance and the instructions for card registration. The method is to register at group meetings using the method of self-reporting by individuals and review by the masses. During registration, special attention should be paid to investigating and clearing out elements who have been deprived of political rights, should not join the trade union, or should not enjoy labor insurance, such as fugitive landlords, and officers and special agents of the Kuomintang army, police, and military police who have committed counter-revolutionary crimes and have not yet repented. Only in this way can we ensure the smooth implementation of labor insurance work. Trade union organizations in each province and city, and the national committees of the four industrial trade unions of railways, postal services, telecommunications, and coal mines, shall print registration cards in accordance with the prescribed format and distribute them to grassroots trade union organizations implementing labor insurance before April 1st. Printing expenses may be paid in advance and reported to the labor insurance department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for approval and reimbursement. If the items on the original registered old cards are different from the items on the new cards, they must be changed and supplemented before April 20th.

(7) Supervise the Administrative Side and Capitalists of Enterprises to Strengthen or Establish Medical Institutions

For all factories and mines enterprises that have established medical institutions and are implementing labor insurance in accordance with the Labor Insurance Regulations, trade union organizations shall, according to the specific circumstances and the actual needs of workers and staff, supervise and help the administrative side or the capitalists to replenish medical equipment. Those that have not established medical institutions should urge the establishment of medical clinics separately or jointly. If they cannot be established due to limited conditions, there should be designated hospitals or designated doctors responsible for treating sick and injured workers and staff. All expenses related to medical clinics, hospitals, designated hospitals, and designated doctors shall be borne by the administrative side or the capitalists in accordance with the provisions of the Labor Insurance Regulations.

The general trade unions or offices of the major administrative regions, the directly subordinate provincial and municipal trade union organizations, and the Shanghai General Trade Union must submit a special report on the preparatory work for the implementation of labor insurance before the end of April.
