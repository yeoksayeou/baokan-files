Editor's Note: "Experiences in Establishing a Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region" written by Comrade Fu Zhensheng, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, describes in detail the various aspects of the Party's propaganda network in the Northeast region. It can be provided to Party organizations across the country as a reference when implementing the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network. The full text is divided into six sections: 1. The Establishment and Development of the Party's Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region; 2. A New Stage in Mass Propaganda Work and its Significance; 3. Basic Experiences in Establishing a Propaganda Network; 4. The Content of Propaganda; 5. The Forms and Methods of Propaganda; 6. Establishing Systematic Leadership over the Propaganda Network. We have decided to publish it in serial form over the next five days, starting today, and hope readers will pay attention.

  I. The Establishment and Development of the Party's Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region

    The Party's mass propaganda work must adapt to the needs of national defense and economic construction, and effectively serve national defense and economic construction.

    However, our past mass propaganda work was not satisfactory. In terms of content, it lacked systematicness; in terms of time, it was often intermittent, lacking regularity and persistence. As a result, many erroneous and reactionary propaganda and rumors often circulated among the people without timely, appropriate, and fatal blows from our Party. The Party's policies and propositions were not adequately publicized and explained to the people in a timely manner. Therefore, counter-revolutionaries often took the opportunity to engage in activities, using temporary disturbances to confuse people and causing significant damage to the people's cause.

    The main reason why mass propaganda work has long been in this state is that our Party has not effectively organized the Party's propaganda force and has not solved this problem organizationally. This is as the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party": "One of the main weaknesses of the Party's propaganda work to the people is that Party organizations at all levels often regard it as the work of a few people and as a temporary task, and have not established the necessary systems to make it a regular task for all Communist Party members, and to provide systematic leadership and management by Party committees at all levels." In order to thoroughly overcome the shortcomings of mass propaganda work organizationally, the Central Committee pointed out in this decision: "The Party must resolutely eliminate this phenomenon and strengthen propaganda work to the people. For this purpose, it is necessary to systematically establish a regular propaganda network for the people, that is, to establish propagandists in each Party branch, to establish reporters in the Party's leading organs at all levels, and to establish certain systems for the work of propagandists and reporters."

    The work of establishing the Party's propaganda network in the Northeast region began in the spring of last year. From late February to mid-March, the pilot group of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau conducted pilot work at the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory in Shenyang. The Propaganda Department of the Zhaodong County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Heilongjiang Province, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department, on March 17, led by Comrade Xue Ying, the Minister of Propaganda, and two staff members and one district propaganda member, personally arrived at Taiping Mountain Village and Xibali Village in the Ninth District to conduct pilot projects. Combining with spring plowing propaganda, propaganda groups were established under the leadership of the Party branch. Seventeen propagandists were selected in Taiping Mountain Village, and nine propagandists were selected in Xibali Village. In April, pilot projects began in Anshan and Fushun. After the Northeast Industrial and Mining Enterprise Propaganda Work Conference in May, pilot projects were carried out in various places one after another. In June, comrades from the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau assisted the General Branch of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, focusing on the First Manufacturing Workshop and the Assembly Workshop, to pilot the establishment of a propaganda organization for nearly two months, cultivating twenty-two propagandists (then called agitators), including eleven Party members, five League members, and six non-Party activists. Their positions included: branch secretary, deputy director of the site, chairman of the trade union, secretary of the Communist Youth League, production team leader, group leader, production advanced worker, veteran technical worker, etc. Their educational level was: one person with a university degree, three with junior high school, nine with senior elementary school, eight with junior elementary school, and one with basic literacy. On average, there was one propagandist for every twenty-four workers in the workshop. In July, Dalian City piloted in industrial and mining enterprises and streets. In August, the Benxi Coal Mine Department piloted the propaganda organization. In October, the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country was universally launched, and the propaganda network also developed greatly with the progress of the movement.

    At present, the Party's propaganda network in the Northeast region has had a good start. Most areas have already undergone pilot projects, and some areas have already been established. According to statistics at the end of last year, there were 117,283 propagandists in the region. The distribution of propagandists is already quite extensive in some areas and units with a better foundation. For example, in the Far East Electric Glass Factory in Dalian, the number of propagandists accounts for 10% of the total number of employees; in the Anshan Ore Dressing Plant, propagandists account for 6% of all employees; in the Shenyang Nail Factory, the branch with the most propagandists has reached 13% of the total number of employees; and in the Shenyang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, direct on-site propagandists account for 9.3% of the total number of employees. In rural areas, propagandist organizations have been established in four-fifths of the villages in Heilongjiang Province, and there are more than 40,000 propagandists in the province. In Nangang Village, Jiahe, Jilin, there are 342 households with 1,364 people, and 72 propagandists, accounting for 5.4% of the total village population. In Taiping Mountain Village, Zhaodong, Heilongjiang, there are 264 households with 1,320 people, and 19 propagandists, accounting for 1.4% of the total village population.

    From the perspective of the political quality of the propagandists, the vast majority meet the standards stipulated in the Central Committee's decision. Among them, the main ones are Communist Party members and members of the New Democratic Youth League, and the rest are labor models and other revolutionary activists among the masses around the branch who volunteer to undertake propaganda work under the leadership of the Party. In many areas, Party members and League members have become the backbone and core force of the propaganda network. For example, in the total number of propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises in Anshan, Communist Party members and Youth League members account for 75%. Among the 98 propagandists in the ore dressing plant, there are 12 factory-level cadres including the secretary of the general branch committee, the director and deputy directors, 53 Party members, 23 League members, and 22 active members of the masses. One-third of the propagandists were selected as labor models and work models. In the propaganda network of the Northeast Railway, 70% are Communist Party members, 22% are Youth League members, 2% are labor models, and 6% are revolutionary activists. Among the 1,824 propagandists in Dalian, 818 are Party members, 360 are League members, and 646 are revolutionary activists. Among the 479 propagandists in Andong, 104 are Party members, accounting for 21.7%, 203 are League members, accounting for 42.3%, and 172 are revolutionary activists, accounting for 36%. Among the 100 propagandists in the Benxi Coal Mine Department, 55 are Party members, accounting for 55%, 8 are League members, accounting for 8%, and 37 are revolutionary activists, accounting for 37%. Among the 72 propagandists in Nangang Village, Jiahe, Jilin, 25 are Party members, 32 are League members, 11 are representatives of the people of the province, county, and district, and 4 are production team leaders.

    If we observe and analyze from the perspective of the role of the propaganda organization, then it can be said that in some areas and units with a better working foundation, the propaganda organization has become a bridge and link between the Party and the people, and has become a powerful assistant to the Party organization. Among the 183 representatives who participated in the First Congress of Propagandists in the Northeast Region, there are indeed many propaganda experts, and they are indeed propagandists of the Party in the true sense of the word. They have all exerted a high degree of enthusiasm in various work posts, and have played a great role in supporting the front line of national defense and promoting industrial and agricultural production. They grow up among the masses and are very familiar with the ideological trends of the masses. They can even feel the breathing of the masses. They are familiar with the problems in production and have prestige among the masses. Their every move affects the masses. Therefore, their propaganda can be closely integrated with production and current tasks, and deeply hit the hearts of the masses, producing practical results. Judging from the current level of propagandists and the extent of their role, they can be roughly divided into three types. Taking the Ninth District of Zhaodong, Heilongjiang as an example, the district has twenty-one branches and two hundred and thirty-one propaganda groups. The first type: can play a role regularly. After the district committee assigns tasks, the branch immediately discusses how to complete them, and after the meeting, it convenes a meeting of propagandists to specifically assign propaganda tasks. The next meeting will check the work. Propagandists fix their propaganda targets (propagandists are fixed in the production team during production, and are fixed in the residential area during slack farming season), and study twice a month. There are five branches belonging to this type; the second type: can play a role, but not regularly. If the district committee grasps the leadership tightly, it can also carry out propaganda, but it does not play a role or plays a small role at ordinary times. There are ten branches belonging to this type; the third type: does not play a role, because the original branch foundation is poor. There are six branches belonging to this type. Among the propagandists in the Northeast Railway system, it is estimated that those who can play a role account for 50%, those who play a role irregularly account for 30%, and those who do not play a role or play a small role account for 20%.

    At present, the work of establishing a propaganda network in various places is not only developing unevenly in terms of region, and the propaganda network has only been established in some areas and units, but also the propaganda network that has been established has not been adequately cultivated and educated due to the short period of time. Some places have undergone short training, and some places have not undergone training at all. The most serious problem is that Party committees at all levels have not established a regular and systematic leadership system for the work of the propaganda network. Therefore, at present, only a small number of the propaganda networks in various places can truly play the role of the propaganda network. Therefore, in the future, in order to make the propaganda network we have established truly effective and not become a mere formality, and in order to conscientiously implement the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party," all our comrades must make serious efforts. Any overestimation of existing achievements, as well as complacency, relaxation, and laxity, are harmful to the cause of the Party and must be overcome in a timely manner.

    The task for the first half of this year is mainly to consolidate and improve the propaganda network that has been established, and to seek necessary development on the basis of consolidation. In places where the branch foundation is better and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is relatively developed, but the propaganda network has not yet been established, we should immediately start to establish it. In cities, we should mobilize Party branches in Party and government organs at all levels and people's organizations to establish propaganda networks, select Party members, League members, and non-Party activists from their own organs as propagandists, and participate in the propaganda work of street residents. The branch of an organ should make the organization of propaganda work to the masses one of the regular tasks of the branch. In addition to actively establishing street propaganda networks, the city Party committee and district Party committee should regularly convene propagandist meetings or representative meetings of propagandists from organ branches and street propagandists, stipulate propaganda content and tasks, divide propaganda areas and targets, and regularly check work.

    The work of establishing and consolidating the propaganda network should be combined with the work of consolidating the branch. At the same time, we must unify development work with consolidation work, that is, carry out consolidation work while developing, or pay attention to development work while consolidating. In terms of the general requirements for developing the propaganda network, in the first half of this year, it is best to strive to achieve the establishment of propaganda networks in 60% to 80% of the branches of industrial and mining enterprises, and in 30% to 60% of the branches of rural and organ units. The number of propagandists can be determined according to the working foundation of the branch, the number of Party members and League members, and the total number of employees. In factories and mines, the number of propagandists should generally account for about 5% of the total number of employees.

  II. A New Stage in Mass Propaganda Work and its Significance

    Throughout the Northeast region, due to the initial establishment of the Party's propaganda network and the gradual expansion of the Party's propaganda force, the Party's mass propaganda work has made new progress. Especially in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the Party's mass propaganda work has begun to enter a new stage.

    The main characteristic of propaganda work in this period is that the organization of propaganda work has been strengthened, the depth and breadth of propaganda work have made new progress, and some better areas have begun to maintain the regularity and persistence of propaganda work. In the past, the problems we felt were more difficult to solve in propaganda work were: how to make the whole Party pay attention to propaganda work, how to make propaganda work truly go deep into the masses, and how to maintain the regularity and persistence of propaganda work. Now it seems that as long as we continue to consolidate and expand the Party's propaganda network and constantly expand the propaganda force that combines leading cadres and activists, these problems can be solved.

    In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the responsible comrades of Party and government organs at all levels and people's mass organizations and the vast number of propagandists scattered in various places have formed a strong propaganda force and have played a considerable role, greatly expanding the scope of propaganda. For example, in Dalian, 19,000 people were organized to listen to reports in two weeks. Party, government, labor, and youth organizations in Shenyang organized more than 100,000 people to listen to reports. In Harbin, responsible persons of various organs personally reported 386 times, with an audience of 462,000 people. The Benxi Municipal Party Committee made 18 reports, and responsible comrades from various factories and mines reported 620 times, with an audience of 70,000 people. There were 270 discussion meetings, with approximately 25,000 participants. There were 30 accusation meetings, with approximately 10,000 participants. There were 15 speech contests, with more than 1,000 participants. In addition, there were story evenings, reminiscence talks, and send-off rallies for joining the army. More than 50 cadres were organized in urban areas to conduct home visits and hold 151 family discussion meetings in street groups, with an audience of approximately 9,000 people. More than 1,000 propagandists in Fushun went deep into street groups, courtyards, and pit entrances to hold 2,231 discussion meetings, with approximately 121,500 participants. Counties in Heilongjiang held 370 report meetings respectively, with an audience of 174,800 people. In Liaodong, the scope of propaganda reached more than 60% of the total population. According to preliminary statistics from five districts in Fuxian County, the masses who participated in meetings and received oral propaganda accounted for more than 67% of the population. In the past, only one-fifth of the rural population regularly participated in meetings. The reason is that "one person is in charge of thousands of mouths," and the "one person" who attends the meeting does not convey the message to the whole family afterwards. Therefore, many things remain with these family representatives. In this propaganda campaign, special emphasis was placed on holding various small meetings and going deep into the elderly, young and old, men and women, and women, so the scope of propaganda was greatly expanded. Tonghua City specially organized propaganda teams to carry out propaganda to the business community and street residents. After twenty days, approximately 70% of the street residents and approximately 18% of the business community received propaganda. According to statistics from ten counties in Jilin, approximately 60% of the rural areas saw the anti-American and military dramas, 70% heard the anti-American and military songs, and 30% saw the anti-American cartoons.

    From the perspective of the propaganda effect, the political awareness of the broad masses of the people has been universally improved through propaganda and education. This has not only given a relatively deep understanding of the essence of U.S. imperialism's aggression, the attitude towards aiding Korea, and the comparison of the strength of the enemy and ourselves, so that the reactionary rumors spread by counter-revolutionaries have been swept away, and the chaotic thoughts that occurred in some people due to the Korean defeat in a period of time have been clarified, but also the various national inferiority complexes formed under the oppression of imperialism in the past 100 years have been changed, and the self-esteem and self-confidence of the Chinese nation have been greatly promoted. According to the summary report of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in Liaodong: After this propaganda campaign, most of the people have the following concepts in their minds: "American devils are worse than Japanese devils," "American devils want to follow the old path of Japan, taking Korea as a springboard to invade China," "If American devils come, our good days will be over," so "Helping Korea is right, just like helping a neighbor put out a fire." At the same time, they also understood the principles that "fighting depends mainly on people, on morale, not on weapons," "we have a large population," "we have five million troops," "fighting is brave and resolute," "American planes are numerous, but they cannot occupy territory," "warships cannot go on dry land," and "we also have the Soviet Union's elder brother to help us, so we can definitely win the war." Because the masses have these basic concepts in their minds, the blind fear of the United States in the previous period has gradually been eliminated, and pro-American and pro-American thoughts have no place in the masses. The thought of hating, despising, and scorning U.S. imperialism and actively resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has begun to be established. Therefore, a mass and unprecedented movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country has been launched in the entire Northeast region, and it has a considerable degree of awareness. At the same time, due to the successful launch of this movement, our various tasks have been completed faster and better than before. The workers have actively launched patriotic production competitions, ensuring the early and over-fulfillment of the annual production tasks. The peasants have actively participated in wartime service work and continued to engage in sideline production. Young workers and young students have actively participated in military cadre schools. The business community has actively purchased public bonds and actively completed tax payment tasks. In short, everything shows that due to the development of mass propaganda work, all tasks have been guaranteed. Propaganda work is ideological work. Once the thoughts of cadres and masses are communicated and improved, no work is difficult.

    Due to the development of the Party's mass propaganda work, and the subsequent launch of conscious mass movements, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer, the Party members and cadres have been educated, and the basic methods of the Party's leadership of the masses have been learned. The phenomena of coercion and commandism and simplified working methods in work have also been relatively reduced, which is of great significance for thoroughly improving the Party's leadership style.

    In the past, due to the lack of universality and depth in mass propaganda work, the Party's propositions and policies mostly remained in the organs and cadres. The masses did not know the state's policies, and even had doubts and misunderstandings, which gave counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to take advantage of. They used temporary disturbances to spread rumors, confuse people, and disrupt social order, thus causing losses to the cause of the people. On the contrary, due to the strengthening and deepening of mass propaganda work, especially due to the establishment of the Party's propaganda network, the propagandists carry out propaganda anytime and anywhere, talking to everyone they see and spreading the Party's various propositions and policies to the broad masses, which has strengthened the connection between the Party and the masses and closely united millions of people around the Party. For example, in the early days of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, a relatively common fear of the United States and narrow nationalist views on the issue of aiding Korea occurred among the masses, but after widespread propaganda, correct understanding was established among the masses, and erroneous understandings were corrected. The masses' impression of our propagandists is that "they are telling the truth" and "the Communist Party is really thinking about the people." In the air defense evacuation work in Andong, because many cadres went deep into the masses to patiently persuade and educate the masses, they moved the masses, and thus the relationship between the Party and the masses and the relationship between cadres and the masses were significantly improved. For example, many citizens in Andong reflected: "This time, we really saw that the Communist Party is wholeheartedly serving the people, and the People's Government is really the government of the people." In rural areas, the masses are also particularly close to the Party, feeling that the Party "only propagates production matters," "all they say is true," and "it is hard for the Party to think so carefully for us."

    In the past, some comrades had an extremely rude attitude towards the Party's mass propaganda work. They said: "Buildings are built with bricks one by one, not by blowing them up." "Coal is dug out shovel by shovel, not by propaganda." "We are too busy with work to take care of propaganda." Obviously, in the minds of these comrades, they thought that they could complete all tasks by relying on administrative management and coercion and commandism. Therefore, they were obsessed with simple administrative orders and simplified working methods. But after the masses are mobilized, they will give these comrades a profound education. Comrades who originally thought that "coal is not produced by propaganda" now say: "Real propaganda has produced coal!" Comrades who used to think that "such urging is not moving, what role can propaganda play" later saw that even with hard work and propaganda, the masses were really mobilized, and said: "This is really a good method. It doesn't delay work, it doesn't violate coercion, and the masses are still working hard. If I had known this method earlier, why commit coercion and commandism?" Many cadres realized that "once the thoughts of the masses are communicated, everything is easy to handle, and tasks can be completed without coercion and commandism." In the report on anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda from the Fuxian County Committee to the Liaodong Provincial Committee, it said: "The work experience in this period tells us that the working method of combining in-depth current affairs propaganda and mobilization with the full play of organizational forces is the working method of the mass line; it is the best method to overcome commandism and complete arduous work tasks." The report of the Liaodong Provincial Committee said: "Many cadres said: I must study propaganda work well in the future. Some cadres have regarded whether they attach importance to propaganda work as a concrete manifestation of whether they have a mass viewpoint, and some leading cadres have regarded propaganda work as the basic method for them to realize ideological leadership."

    Improving the understanding of Party members and cadres on propaganda work is still an extremely important issue at present. We must understand the significance of mass propaganda work from the fundamental issues such as the relationship between the Party and the masses and the basic methods of the Party's leadership of the masses.

    Our Party is a completely new type of working-class political party. It is the advanced and organized force of the Chinese working class and the highest organizational form of its class organization. Our Party has a revolutionary program and revolutionary policies that thoroughly represent the interests of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. Our Party has gathered the most loyal, bravest, most conscious, and most disciplined representatives of the Chinese working class and the working people. It is the embodiment of the wisdom, will, and courage of the working class. Therefore, our Party has become the leading and guiding force of the Chinese people and the most advanced assault force. Our Party has led the Chinese people in a heroic struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and has achieved glorious victories in the long struggle.

    The reason why our Party has achieved victory in the long and tortuous struggle and has won the love and trust of the Chinese people is not only due to the correctness of the Party's political line and the Party's revolutionary program and policies that thoroughly represent the interests of the Chinese people, but also because our Party and the Chinese people have established a close relationship of flesh and blood. Maintaining close ties with the masses is something that only our working-class political party can have. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The closest ties between us Communists and the broadest masses of the people are a prominent sign that distinguishes us from any other political party." Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the book "On the Party": "The vanguard of the people must establish a correct relationship with the people. It must represent the interests of the people in all aspects, especially in politics. It must treat the people with a correct attitude and lead the people with correct methods. Then the vanguard can be closely linked to the people. Otherwise, the vanguard is entirely possible to be separated from the people. And if the vanguard is separated from the people, it cannot become the vanguard of the people. It will not only fail to realize the task of liberating the people, but also be in direct danger of being eliminated by the enemy."

    So, what is the correct method of Party leadership? The basic method of the Party leading the masses is ideological and political leadership. It is to rely on the Party to regularly conduct political propaganda to the people, to use persuasion and education, and to continuously improve the enthusiasm and awareness of the masses to ensure the victorious completion of various tasks, rather than using administrative management and commanding troops, not using orders. Therefore, the Party's mass propaganda work is an important method to consolidate the connection between the Party and the people, it is the most important method for the Party to educate the people, and it is the most important method to explain the Party's policies to the people and mobilize the masses to implement the decisions and calls of the Party and the People's Government. The Party's mass propaganda work is a political activity. Its purpose is to spread certain ideas and slogans to influence the understanding and emotions of the broad masses of the people. Propaganda is an important weapon in the political struggle of classes and political parties. Our Party must master this powerful weapon, continuously improve the political consciousness and class consciousness of the people, and unite the broad masses of the people around the Party.

    Coercion, commandism, and simplified working methods must be overcome. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In all work, commandism is wrong because it exceeds the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of the voluntary participation of the masses, and is prone to impatience." All those who are accustomed to handling affairs with simple administrative orders only know to tell the masses to "do this" without telling them "why to do this." They do not know how to turn the Party's slogans into the masses' own slogans, and how to turn the tasks put forward by the Party into the masses' own tasks. They do not know how to enlighten the masses' consciousness and appropriately wait for the masses' consciousness, and do not know how to take many steps to naturally revolutionize the masses. They attempt to force the masses to accept the Party's slogans and tasks and force the masses to take action through simple, rigid, and commanding methods. Our Party is the party in power in the country, and the broad masses of the people have extremely high faith in our Party. Therefore, if some coercive command styles are not corrected in a timely manner, they will inevitably damage the interests of the Party.

　　东北区建立宣传网的经验
       富振声
    编者按：中共中央东北局宣传部宣传处长富振声同志所写的《东北区建立宣传网的经验》，详细叙述了东北区党的宣传网的各方面情况，可以供给全国各地党组织在执行中央建立宣传网决定时参考。全文分六节：一、东北区党的宣传网的建立与发展；二、群众宣传工作的新阶段及其意义；三、建立宣传网的基本经验；四、宣传的内容；五、宣传的形式和方法；六、建立对宣传网的系统领导。我们决定从今天起在五天内连载完毕，希望读者注意。
  一、东北区党的宣传网的建立与发展
    党的群众宣传工作，必须适应国防建设与经济建设的需要，并切实为国防建设与经济建设服务。
    但我们过去的群众宣传工作，是难于使人满意的。在内容上缺乏系统性，在时间上往往时紧时松，断断续续，缺乏经常性与持久性，以致有许多错误的和反动的宣传和谣言经常在人民群众中流传，遇不到我们党及时的、应有的和致命的打击。党的政策与主张，没有及时的在人民群众中进行充分的宣传解释。因此，反革命分子常常乘机活动，利用一时的风吹草动，蛊惑人心，使人民事业遭受重大损害。
    群众宣传工作之所以长期处于这种状态，其主要原因是在于我们党没有很好的组织党的宣传队伍，没有从组织上来解决这一问题。这一点，正如中共中央在《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》中所指出的：“目前党对人民群众的宣传工作的主要弱点之一，就是各级党的组织往往把它当做一部分人的和临时性的工作，而没有建立必要的制度，使它成为全体共产党员的经常性的工作，并由各级党的委员会给以有系统的领导和管理。”为了从组织上彻底克服群众宣传工作的缺点，党中央在这一决定中指出：“党必须坚决消灭这种现象，加强对人民群众的宣传工作。为此目的，就必须有系统地建立对人民群众的经常性的宣传网，即在党的每个支部建立宣传员，在党的各级领导机关设立报告员，并建立关于宣传员报告员工作的一定制度。”
    东北区建立党的宣传网的工作，开始于去年春季。二月末至三月中，东北局宣传部宣传处试点小组，曾在沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂进行试点工作。黑龙江肇东县委宣传部根据省委宣传部的指示，于三月十七日，由宣传部长薛英同志率领两名干事一名区宣传委员，亲自到达九区太平山村和西八里村试点。他们结合春耕宣传，在支部领导下建立了宣传员小组。太平山村选拔了十七名宣传员，西八里村选拔了九名宣传员。四月鞍山与抚顺两市开始试点。五月东北工矿企业宣传工作会议之后，各地陆续进行试点，六月东北局宣传处同志协助沈阳机器一厂总支，以第一制造场，装配场为重点，试行建立宣传员组织，时间近两月，培养了二十二名宣传员（当时叫鼓动员），其中有十一名党员，五名团员，六名非党积极分子。他们的职务包括：支部书记，现场副主任，工会主席，青年团书记、生产班长、组长、生产先进者、老技术工人等。文化程度是：大学一人，初中三人，高小九人，初小八名，初通文字一人。全场工人平均不到二十四名就有一个宣传员。七月大连市在工矿企业和街道试点、八月本溪煤矿部试办宣传员组织。十月普遍展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，宣传网也随着运动的进展，有了大量的发展。
    目前东北区党的宣传网已有了一个良好的开端。大部分地区业已经过试办，部分地区已经建立起来了。截至去年年底统计，全区宣传员已达十一万七千二百八十三人。部分基础较好的地区和单位，宣传员的分布已相当广泛。如大连远东电业玻璃工厂，宣传员人数占职工总人数的百分之十；鞍山选矿厂宣传员占全体职工的百分之六；沈阳制钉厂宣传员最多的支部，已达职工总数的百分之十三；沈阳市化学制药厂直属现场宣传员占职工总数的百分之九点三。在农村，黑龙江全省四分之三的村子，已建立了宣传员组织，全省宣传员已达四万余名。吉林蛟河南岗村，三百四十二户，一千三百六十四人，宣传员七十二名，占全村人口的百分之五点四。黑龙江肇东太平山村，二百六十四户，一千三百二十人，十九名宣传员，占全村人口的百分之一点四。
    从宣传员的政治质量上看，绝大多数是符合中央决定中所规定的标准的。其中主要是共产党员和新民主主义青年团员，其余的也是支部周围群众中自愿在党领导下担任宣传工作的劳动模范和其他革命积极分子。在许多地区，党员、团员已成为宣传网的骨干与核心力量。如鞍山工矿企业的宣传员总数中，共产党员和青年团员即占百分之七十五。选矿厂的九十八名宣传员中包括总支委书记、正副厂长等厂级干部十二人，党员五十三人，团员二十三人，群众积极分子二十二人。在宣传员中，有三分之一被选为劳动模范和工作模范。东北铁路各地的宣传网中，拥有百分之七十的共产党员，百分之二十二的青年团员，百分之二的劳动模范，和百分之六的革命积极分子。大连市的一千八百二十四名宣传员中，党员八百十八名，团员三百六十名，革命积极分子六百四十六名。安东市宣传员四百七十九名，其中党员一百○四名，占百分之二一、七，团员二百○三人，占百分之四二、三，革命积极分子一百七十二人，占百分之三六。本溪煤矿部的一百名宣传员中，党员五十五人，占百分之五五，团员八人，占百分之八，革命积极分子三十七人，占百分之三十七。吉林蛟河南岗村的七十二名宣传员，党员二十五人，团员三十二人，省县区人民代表十一人，生产组长四人。
    如从宣传员组织的作用上加以观察和分析，那么可以说在部分工作基础较好的地区和单位，宣传员组织已经成为党和人民政府联系群众的桥梁和纽带，成为党组织的有力助手。在参加东北区第一届宣传员代表会议的一百八十三名代表中，的确有不少宣传能手，他们的确是名副其实的党的宣传员。他们在各种工作岗位上都发挥了高度的积极性，不论在支援国防前线，和推动工农业生产方面，都起了很大的推动作用。他们生长在群众中，对群众的思想动向很熟悉，甚至群众的一呼一吸他们都能感觉到，他们既熟悉生产中的问题，又在群众中有威信，他们的一举一动都对群众发生影响。因此，他们的宣传能紧密地结合生产，结合当前任务，并深深地打入群众的心坎中去，发生实际的效果。就目前宣传员的水平，在他们所起作用的程度上，大体可分为三种类型。以黑龙江肇东九区为例，该区有二十一个支部，二百三十一个宣传小组。第一类：能经常起作用。区委布置任务后，支部即进行讨论怎样完成，会后即召集宣传员会议，具体布置宣传任务，下次会议进行检查，宣传员固定宣传对象（生产时宣传员固定在生产小组，农闲时固定在居住区），每月进行两次学习。属于这一类的支部有五个；第二类：能起作用，但不经常。区委如抓紧领导，也能进行宣传，但平时不起作用或作用不大。属于这类的支部有十个；第三类：不起作用，原因是原来的支部基础差。属于这类的支部有六个。在东北铁路系统的宣传员中，估计能起作用者占百分之五十，起作用不经常者占百分之三十，不起作用或很少作用者占百分之二十。
    目前各地建立宣传网的工作，不仅在地区上发展不平衡，宣传网只在部分地区和单位建立起来，而且已建立起来的宣传网，也由于时间短促，培养教育还很不够。有些地方经过短短的训练，有些地方根本就没有经过训练。最严重的问题是各级党委对宣传网的工作还没有建立经常的系统的领导制度，因而目前各地的宣传网，真正能发挥宣传网作用者，也还属于少数。因此，今后为了使我们所建立起来的宣传网确实有效而不流于形式主义，为了认真贯彻《中共中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》，我们全党同志仍须作严重的努力。任何过高估计已有成绩，以及自满自足松懈涣散心理，都是有害于党的事业的，因此必须及时予以克服。
    今年上半年的任务，主要是对已建立起来的宣传网，加以巩固和提高，在巩固的基础上求得必要的发展。在支部基础较好，抗美援朝运动也比较发展，但尚未建立宣传网的地方，应即着手建立。在城市应发动各级党政机关以及人民团体中党支部建立宣传网的工作，选拔本机关的党员、团员和非党积极分子为宣传员，参加街道居民的宣传工作。机关支部应把组织对群众的宣传工作，作为支部经常的任务之一。城市市委与区委除应积极建立街道宣传网外，应定期召开机关支部宣传员与街道宣传员的宣传员大会或代表会议，规定宣传内容和任务，划分宣传地区和对象，定期检查工作。
    建立与巩固宣传网的工作，应与整顿支部的工作结合进行。同时也必须使发展工作与巩固工作统一起来，即在发展中同时进行巩固工作，或在巩固工作中同时注意发展工作。在发展宣传网的一般要求上，今年上半年最好能争取达到在工矿企业支部有百分之六十至八十建立宣传网，农村支部和机关支部有百分之三十至六十建立宣传网。宣传员的人数，可根据支部工作基础、党员团员人数及职工总数而定。在厂矿企业中宣传员人数一般的以占职工总人数的百分之五左右为宜。
  二、群众宣传工作的新阶段及其意义
    东北全区由于党的宣传网的初步建立，党的宣传队伍的逐步扩大，已使党的群众宣传工作有了新的进展。特别在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，党的群众宣传工作已开始进入一个新的阶段。
    这一时期宣传工作的主要特点，是宣传工作的组织性加强了，宣传工作的深度和广度有了新的进展，某些较好地区已开始保持了宣传工作的经常性与持久性。过去在宣传工作中，我们感到比较难于解决的问题是：如何使全党重视宣传工作，如何使宣传工作真正深入群众，以及如何保持宣传工作的经常性与持久性等问题。现在看来，只要我们继续巩固和扩大党的宣传网，不断扩大领导骨干与积极分子相结合的宣传队伍，那么这些问题是可以获得解决的。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，各级党政机关人民群众团体的负责同志和散布在各地的广大宣传员们，结成了一支坚强的宣传队伍，发挥了相当大的作用，使宣传面大大扩大了。如大连市，在两周内组织了一万九千人听报告。沈阳党、政、工、青组织了十余万人听报告。哈尔滨市各机关负责人亲自报告三百八十六次，听众达四十六万二千人。本溪市委作报告十八次，各厂矿负责同志报告六百二十次，听众达七万人，座谈会二百七十次，参加人数约二万五千人，控诉会三十次，参加人数约一万人，讲演比赛会十五次，参加一千余人。此外尚有故事晚会、回忆漫谈以及参军欢送会等。在市区组织五十多干部，分别进行家庭访问，以街组为单位召开家庭座谈会一百五十一次，听众约九千人。抚顺千余名宣传员，深入街组、大院、坑口，举行座谈会二千二百三十一次，约有十二万一千五百人参加。黑龙江各县分别召开三百七十次报告会，听众达十七万四千八百余人。在辽东，宣传面达到全人口百分之六十以上。如复县五个区的初步统计，参加会议，接受过口头宣传的群众，占人口的百分之六十七以上。过去农村经常参加会议的，仅占农村人口的五分之一。原因是“家有千口，主事一人”，而参加会议的“一人”，会后又不向全家传达，因此，许多事情都停留在这些家庭代表身上。而在这次宣传中，特别强调召开各种小型会议，深入到老头、老太太、青壮年、妇女群众中去，因而宣传面是大大扩大了。通化市专门组织宣传队向工商界和街道居民进行宣传，先后二十天，接受宣传的，在街道市民方面约占总人口的百分之七十，工商界约占百分之十八。吉林根据十个县的统计，约有百分之六十的农村看到抗美参军戏，百分之七十听到抗美参军歌，百分之三十看到抗美漫画。
    从宣传效果上看，经过宣传教育，使广大人民群众的政治觉悟普遍地提高了一步。这不但对美帝侵略本质、对援朝态度、对敌我力量对比等，有了比较深刻的认识，使反革命分子所散布的反动谣言为之一扫，使一个时期因朝鲜失利而在一部人中发生的混乱思想，得到了澄清，而且近百年来在帝国主义压迫下形成的种种民族自卑心理也有所改变，中华民族的自尊心和自信心大大地发扬起来了。根据辽东抗美援朝运动总结报告：经过这次宣传，大多数人民群众思想上有这样几个概念：“美国鬼子比日本鬼子还坏”，“美国鬼子想走日本的老路，拿朝鲜当跳板侵略中国”，“美国鬼子来了，咱们的好日子就过不成”，所以“帮助朝鲜是应该的，就像帮助邻居救火一样”。同时也懂得了“打仗主要靠人，靠士气，不靠武器”，“咱们人口多”，“有五百万大军”，“打仗勇敢坚决”，“美国飞机多，不能占地盘”，“军舰不能上旱沿”，“还有苏联老大哥帮助咱们，保险能打胜仗”等道理。由于群众思想上有了这些基本的概念，使前一时期盲目恐美的思想逐渐被消除了，崇美亲美思想在群众中已无容身之地。仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义和积极抗美援朝的思想已开始建立起来。因此，在东北全区开展了一个具有广泛群众性的和规模空前的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并有相当的自觉性。同时也由于这一运动的胜利展开，使我们的各项任务比从前完成的更快更好了。工人群众积极开展爱国主义生产竞赛，保证了全年生产任务的提前与超额完成，农民们积极参加战勤工作，继续进行副业生产，青年工人与青年学生踊跃参加军事干部学校，工商界踊跃购买公债和积极完成纳税任务。总之，一切都说明由于群众宣传工作的开展，一切任务都有了保证。宣传工作是个思想工作，干部和群众的思想搞通了，提高了，什么工作也不困难了。
    由于党的群众宣传工作的开展，以及随之而来的具有自觉性的群众运动的开展，使党与群众的关系更加密切了，教育了党员和干部，学会了党领导群众的基本方法，工作中的强迫命令现象和简单化的工作方式也相对地减少了，这对于彻底改进党的领导作风是具有重大意义的。
    过去由于群众宣传工作不够普遍与深入，党的主张与政策多停留在机关和干部身上，群众对国家政策不摸底，甚而发生怀疑与误解，这就给反革命分子以可乘之机。它们利用一时的风吹草动，散布谣言，蛊惑人心，扰乱社会秩序，因而使人民群众事业遭到损失。反之，由于群众宣传工作的加强与深入，特别是由于党的宣传网的建立，宣传员们随时随地进行宣传，逢人就说见人就唠，把党的各种主张和政策传达到广大群众中去了，这就加强了党与群众的联系，把千百万群众紧密地团结在党的周围了。比如在抗美援朝运动初期，在群众中曾发生比较普的遍恐美思想与在援朝问题上的狭隘民族主义观点，但经过广泛宣传之后，便在群众中树立了正确的认识，纠正了错误认识，群众对我们宣传员的印象是：“讲的都是实在话”，“共产党真正为人民着想”。在安东防空疏散工作中，由于许多干部深入群众耐心苦劝教育群众，感动了群众，因而党群关系干群关系有了显著改进。如安东许多市民反映：“这回真正看到共产党是全心全意给人民办事的，人民政府真正是人民自己的政府。”在农村，群众对党也特别亲切了，觉得党“尽宣传生产的事”，“都说的是真心话”，“难为党给想的这样周到”。
    过去有些同志，对党的群众宣传工作，存在着极为粗暴的态度。他们说：“楼房是一块一块的砖砌起来的，不是鼓吹起来的。”“煤是一锹一锹的挖出来的，不是宣传出来的。”“工作太忙，顾不上宣传了。”很显然的，在这些同志的头脑中，以为只要依靠行政管理和强迫命令，就可以完成一切任务了。因而他们醉心于单纯的行政命令和简单化的工作方式。但群众发动起来之后，就会给这些同志以深刻教育的。原来认为“煤不是宣传出来”的同志，现在都说：“真宣传出煤来了！”过去以为“那样催不动，宣传能起什么作用”的同志，到后来一看连干带宣传真把群众带动起来了，就说：“这真是好法子，又不误工，又不犯强迫，群众干得还很起劲。早知道这个办法，何必犯强迫命令呢？”许多干部认识到“群众思想通了，啥事都好办，不强迫命令也能完成任务”。在复县县委给辽东省委的抗美援朝宣传报告中说：“这一时期的工作经验告诉我们：深入的时事宣传动员和充分发挥组织力量相结合的工作方法，即是群众路线的工作方法；是克服命令主义、完成繁重的工作任务的最好的方法。”辽东省委的报告中说：“许多干部都说：以后非好好学习做宣传工作不可。有些干部已把是否重视宣传工作，看成了是否有群众观点的具体表现，有些领导干部已把宣传工作，看成是自己实现思想领导的基本方法。”
    提高党员和干部对宣传工作的认识，在目前仍是一个极为重要的问题。我们必须从党与群众的关系，党领导群众的基本方法等根本问题上来认识群众宣传工作的意义。
    我们的党，是一个完全新式的工人阶级的政党，它是中国工人阶级的先进的有组织的部队，是它的阶级组织的最高组织形式。我们党有彻底代表中国民族和中国人民利益的革命纲领和革命政策。我们党集合了中国工人阶级与劳动人民中最忠实、最勇敢、最觉悟与最守纪律的代表，是工人阶级的智慧、意志和勇敢的化身，因而我们党成为中国人民的领导和指导的力量，成为最先进的突击力量。我们党领导着中国人民进行了英勇地反帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争，并在长期斗争中取得了光辉的胜利。
    我们党之所以能在长期的迂回曲折的斗争取得了胜利，所以取得中国人民的爱戴与信赖，这不仅是由于党的政治路线的正确，党有彻底代表中国人民利益的革命纲领和政策，而且也由于我们党和中国人民已经建立了血肉相连的密切联系。与群众密切联系，这是只有我们工人阶级的政党才能具有的。毛泽东同志说：“我们共产党人与最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系，是我们区别于任何其他政党的一个显著的标帜。”刘少奇同志在《论党》一书中说：“人民群众的先锋队必须与人民群众建立正确的关系，它必须在各方面，首先在政治上代表人民群众的利益，必须用正确的态度对待人民群众，必须用正确的方法去领导人民群众，然后先锋队才能密切联系于人民群众。否则，先锋队是完全可能脱离人民群众的。而先锋队如果脱离人民群众，就不能成其为人民的先锋队，就不独不能实现解放人民群众的任务，而且有直接被敌人消灭的危险。”
    那么，什么是党领导的正确方法？党领导群众的基本方法，是思想政治领导，是依靠党经常向人民群众进行政治宣传，是用说服教育，不断提高群众积极性和自觉性，以保证各项任务的胜利完成。而不是用行政管理与指挥部队的方法，不是用命令。因此，党的群众宣传工作是巩固党与人民群众联系的重要方法，是党教育人民群众的最重要的方法，是向人民群众解释党的政策，动员群众执行党和人民政府的决定和号召的最重要的方法。党的群众宣传工作是一种政治活动，其目的在于传播一定的思想和口号去影响广大人民群众的认识和情绪。宣传是阶级和政党政治斗争的重要武器。我们党必须掌握这一有力武器，不断提高人民群众的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟，把广大的人民群众团结在党的周围。
    强迫命令和简单化的工作方式，是必须克服的。毛泽东同志说：“在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。”凡是惯于用简单行政命令办事的人，都是只知道要群众“这么办”，而不向群众宣传“为什么这么办”。他们不知道怎样才能把党的口号变为群众自己的口号，怎样才能把党所提出的任务变为群众自己的任务。他们不知道如何才能去启发群众的觉悟并适当地等待群众的觉悟，不知道采取许多步骤去使群众自然而然地革命化。他们企图用简单、生硬的、命令的办法强制群众接受党的口号和任务，并强制群众起来行动。我们的党是领导国家的政党，广大的人民群众对我党有着极高的信仰。因而，如不及时纠正某些强迫命令作风，则势必有损党的利益。
