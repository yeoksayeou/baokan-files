　　To the Editor:
    The government issues grain and loans to farmers in order to help the masses with production. However, some district and village cadres in Gushi County, Henan Province, are taking a completely unserious attitude towards the loan disbursement work. Some are even engaging in corruption and embezzlement, seriously affecting the actual effectiveness of the loan disbursement work. For example, the production grain loans for the ninth district of the county were issued several months ago, but there are still 20,000 jin stored in the district that have not been distributed. Jiang Huairen, the head of Fenggang Township in the district, and cadre Gu Chunlin, gambled together and lost 200,000 yuan of cold-weather clothing loans, and also embezzled 150,000 yuan of draught animal loans. Wang Xinquan, a clerk in the second district, lost 400,000 yuan of cold-weather clothing loans. Jiang Hongzhi and two other cadres in the fifth district were also negligent and lost 2 million yuan in loans. The above facts show that some of our district and village cadres not only do not value the loan disbursement work and care about the production of farmers, but even use their power to engage in corruption and embezzlement, causing great losses to both the government and the farmers. Therefore, I suggest that the local government severely punish these corrupt elements in order to restore the government's prestige among the people.

专栏：来信摘要

　　固始县应速检查贷款工作编辑同志：
    政府为了帮助群众生产，才发放贷粮、贷款给农民。但是河南固始县某些区、村干部，对放贷工作采取毫不严肃的态度，有的甚至贪污腐化，严重地影响了放贷工作的实效。如该县九区的生产贷粮早已发下数月，但至今尚有二万斤存区未发出；该区枫港乡乡长姜怀仁、干部谷春林等共同聚赌，将寒衣贷款输了二十万元，又贪污了耕牛贷款十五万元。二区文书王新全遗失了寒衣贷款四十万元，五区蒋鸿志等三个干部也疏忽大意，遗失了贷款二百万元。以上事实说明我们某些区村干部非但不重视放贷工作，不关心农民的生产，甚至有利用职权贪污腐化的行为，致使政府和农民都受到了很大的损失。因此，我建议当地政府应严办这些贪污分子，以挽回政府在人民间的威信。
