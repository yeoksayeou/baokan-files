　　Inaccuracies in the Party's Statistical Work Should Be Corrected
    ——Letters from Readers Editor's Note:
    The phenomenon of indiscriminate distribution of statistical forms in various regions must be corrected; however, necessary statistical work must still be carried out conscientiously. Comrade Wang Dezong's opinions are correct and should be brought to the attention of Party committees in various regions.

　　Comrades Editors:
    From the circular of the Tongxian Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the criticism of inaccurate statistical figures, it can be seen that among the thirteen statistical reports on branch members given to the regional committee by the county committees of the Chinese Communist Party, nine county committees had statistical figures that were inconsistent before and after, or even inconsistent on the same table. In the statistical report of the Changping County Committee in August 1950, it was stated that five villages in the second district of the county had not established Party branches, but after actual inspection, there were seven, so the second report had two more. The Sanhe County Committee reported that a total of 532 village cadre Party members were trained in the first phase of winter training; however, in the categorized statistics, the total number of cadres, Party members, and League members was 950. The latter increased almost doubled the former. Of course, there are some objective difficulties, such as the low cultural level of cadres who are unable to do statistical work, but some Party committees do not pay enough attention to the Party's statistical work. Currently, Party committees above the county level generally do not have anyone specifically responsible for statistical work, while district committees often have the district committee's organization member doing this work as an adjunct. The area of the district is large, and the number of branches and Party members is large, while the district committee's organization members are busy with central work, and often neglect departmental work, especially statistical work. In some districts, after the central work is assigned, all the cadres of the district committee go to work in the villages, and no one pays attention to statistical work at all. Therefore, when the superior Party committee wants statistical figures, it has to use a rush approach to compile the forms, so errors are inevitable in the figures. As for simply estimating the figures, there are even more problems.

    The Party's statistical work is the basis of the Party's organizational work and an indispensable part of Party building. Therefore, the Party's statistical work must be accurate so that the superior Party committee can accurately understand the overall situation of the Party, conduct analysis and research, and determine the work policy. Therefore, we must attach importance to the Party's statistical work.

    How to overcome the existing shortcomings in the Party's statistical work? I would like to put forward the following suggestions for everyone to study.

    (1) County and district Party committees, especially district committees, should establish regular Party statistical work and overcome the phenomenon of "digging a well when thirsty" or the mistaken idea that "numbers are not a big deal." The district committee should designate an organization clerk to be responsible for this statistical work. Of course, the organization clerk can also carry out other work, such as transferring relationships, collecting Party fees, and receiving and forwarding documents.

    (2) The Party's statistical work is more complicated and technical. Therefore, it is hoped that the regional committee will run short-term training courses on statistical work to specifically train cadres at the county and district levels who are responsible for statistical work. In the past, some comrades, because they were not proficient in their work, made mistakes in writing the family background and personal status when doing statistics. Comrades doing statistical work should strengthen their professional study and use their brains to analyze problems, and not just estimate figures to complete the task. This is harmful to the Party.

    (3) The district committee must establish a strict registration system (Party member increase/decrease, reward/punishment system). In this way, the district committee will always grasp the number of Party members and other information. At the end of each month, these detailed figures and information can be reported to the county committee on time. In this way, the statistical work can be carried out calmly and the statistical figures can be accurate and without error. On the one hand, the district committee should insist on promoting this system, and on the other hand, the county committee should regularly conduct in-depth inspections and supervision.

    (4) When formulating various statistical forms, the superior Party committee should try to be concise and clear, reduce unnecessary statistics, and estimate some special problems that may be encountered, so as to reduce the round-trip time of asking for instructions and replying between superiors and subordinates, so as not to affect the progress of statistical work.

　　党的统计工作中的不精确现象应纠正
    ——读者来信编者按：
    各地滥发统计表格的现象是必须纠正的；但是必要的统计工作，仍须认真的进行。读者王德仲同志的意见是正确的，应引起各地党委会的注意。
                                                    编者同志：
    从中共通县地方委员会关于批评统计数目字不精确的通报中可以看到，在十三个中共县委会给地委会的支部党员的统计报告中，就有九个县委会统计数字前后不相符合，或在同一张表上就不一致。昌平县委在一九五○年八月的统计报告中，该县二区有五个村子没有建立党的支部，但经实际检查后却有七个，因之第二次报告中就多出了两个。三河县委会报告该县去冬第一期集训村干部党员共五百三十二人；但在分类统计中，把干部、党员、团员三项人数总合起来就有九百五十人。后者较前者几增加一倍。这固然有些客观困难，例如干部文化水平低，不会作统计工作，但是也有些党委会确实对党的统计工作不够重视。目前县以上的党委会中，一般的都没有专人负责作统计工作，区委会则常常是区委组织委员附带作这工作。区的面积大，支部与党员数目多，而区委组织委员又多忙于中心工作，对部门工作，特别是统计工作，常常是放松了。有的区在中心工作布置下来后，所有区委会的干部全部下村工作了，根本没有人注意统计工作。因此在上级党委会要统计数字时，不得不用突击的方式来统计造表，这样数字上就难免不发生错误。至于随便估计一下数字，那里边问题就更多。
    党的统计工作是党的组织工作的依据，是党的建设中不可缺少的一部分。所以党的统计工作一定要精确，这样才能使上级党委准确的来了解全党状况，进行分析研究，决定工作方针。因此我们必须重视党的统计工作。
    怎样克服党的统计工作现存的缺点呢？我提出这样几点意见供大家研究。
    （一）县、区党委会，特别是区委会，应建立经常的党的统计工作，克服“临渴掘井”的突击统计现象；或者认为“数字没有什么了不起”的错误想法。区委会应指定组织干事担负此项统计工作。当然组织干事还可以进行其他工作。例如：接转关系、收党费、收转文件等。
    （二）党的统计工作是较复杂的，也是带技术性的。因此希望地委会开办统计工作短期训练班，专门训练县、区担负统计工作的干部。过去有些同志因为工作不熟练，进行统计时，就有把家庭出身，与本人成份写错的现象。作统计工作的同志，要加强业务学习，并要多用脑子分析问题，不要只是为完成任务而估计数字。这样作对党是有害无益的。
    （三）区委会必须树立严格的登记制度（党员增减奖惩等制度）。这样区委会就随时掌握了党员数字及其他情况。每到月终时即可按时向县委会报告这些详细数字与情况。这样统计工作即可从容不迫，统计数字即可精确不误。这种制度一方面区委会应坚持推行，另一方面县委会要经常深入地进行检查与督促。
    （四）上级党委制定各种统计表格时，要尽量作到精简明确，减少不必要的统计，并要估计到可能遇到的一些特殊问题，以减少上下级请示与答复的往返时间，不致影响统计工作的进行。
