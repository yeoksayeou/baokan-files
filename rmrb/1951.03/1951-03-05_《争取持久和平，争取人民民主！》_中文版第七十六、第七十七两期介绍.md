Introducing Issues 76 and 77 of the Chinese Version of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"

Issues 76 and 77 of the Chinese version of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" have been published.

Issue 76 focuses on the 27th anniversary of Lenin's death on January 21st and the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Communist Party. Articles commemorating the 27th anniversary of Lenin's death include the editorial "Leninism - the Invincible Banner of the International Communist Movement" and information on the preparations in various countries for the commemoration. Articles commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Italian Communist Party include Togliatti's "Thirty Years of the Italian Communist Party," Longo's "Leading the People in the Struggle for Peace," Xie Jia's "The Glorious Road of the Working Class Party," and Donofrilio's "Under the Banner of Proletarian Internationalism," among others.

In addition, Issue 76 also contains Hall's "The American People Fight for Peace, Democracy, and Freedom" and Damyanov's "The People's Republic of Bulgaria Marches Towards New Victories Along the Socialist Road."

The editorial in Issue 77 is titled "The People of the World Strengthen the Struggle for Peace." The editorial points out that just as the American aggressors are carrying out their heinous plans to restore German militarism and revive the regular forces of West Germany, and just as the reactionary leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe are directly betraying the interests of their countries and following the aggressive plans of their American masters, they are encountering resolute resistance from the people of various European countries who are fighting for peace and opposing the imperialists' launching of a new war. During Eisenhower's stay in Europe, the protest movements of millions of people never stopped for a single day. They oppose the resurgence of West German fascism and oppose the plans to rearm and remilitarize their countries. This is only the beginning of the great struggle of the people to strive for peace and for the future of mankind! The rulers of France, Italy, Britain, and West Germany use intimidation and violence to suppress the movements of the people of various countries, arousing growing rage and indignation, and causing broader mass movements to defend peace. The editorial points out that the powerful upsurge in the worldwide struggle for peace presents the organized peace movement with new and important responsibilities, namely, the task of further expanding the mass base of this movement, and further increasing the activities of national and local peace committees—the task of consolidating the organization of these committees, and of strengthening their role and developing their initiative in the struggle for peace. The editorial points out that peace fighters in France, Italy, West Germany, Britain, and other countries are now taking important steps to organize more local committees, to absorb representatives of all strata and various political tendencies into these committees, and to use other various methods of contacting the masses. Peace fighters in West Germany, Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, following the example of the heroic French peace fighters, are organizing a referendum movement and are collecting signatures on petitions to oppose West German rearmament. Communist parties in various countries, standing at the forefront of the peace fighters, are calling on the people to form a united front against West German rearmament. They point out to all party organizations that it is necessary to explain to the broad masses that the struggle against arming West Germany and the struggle against arming their own countries are inseparable, and that the struggle against arming West Germany is also the struggle for peace. The editorial concludes: The world peace movement has already won a series of great victories in the struggle against imperialist aggression. New forces joining the ranks of this movement are increasing every day. The further consolidation of the strength of all good people, their firm determination to safeguard peace, and their active participation in the movement to defend peace will completely isolate the American imperialists and will force the warmongers to retreat.

Issue 77 prominently features Posperov's report at the Moscow memorial meeting commemorating the 27th anniversary of Lenin's death and Voda-Berksa's essay commemorating the 25th anniversary of Stalin's "Some Questions Concerning Leninism," entitled "Outstanding Works of Creative Marxism." In addition, it also contains Professor Mukarovsky's "The First Czechoslovak Peace Congress" and Hua Si's "Hungary's Economy is Flourishing," among other essays.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    中文版第七十六、第七十七两期介绍
    《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》中文版第七十六、七十七两期已出版。
    第七十六期以一月二十一日列宁逝世二十七周年纪念及意大利共产党成立三十周年纪念为中心。纪念列宁逝世二十七周年纪念的文章有“列宁主义——国际共产主义运动无敌的旗帜”的社论与列宁逝世二十七周年纪念前夕各国筹备纪念的情形。纪念意大利共产党三十周年纪念的文章有托里亚蒂的《意大利共产党三十年》、朗哥的《领导着人民为和平而斗争》、谢嘉的《工人阶级党的光辉道路》和多诺弗立奥的《在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下》等文。
    此外，第七十六期还登载了霍尔的《美国人民为和平与民主自由而奋斗》。达米亚诺夫的《保加利亚人民共和国沿着社会主义的道路向新的胜利前进》等论文。
    第七十七期社论题为《世界人民加强争取和平的斗争》。社论指出，正当美国侵略者进行恢复德国的军国主义，复活西德的正规部队的罪恶计划和欧洲北大西洋公约国家反动领袖们直接出卖祖国利益追随美国主子的侵略计划的时候，就遭到欧洲各国为和平而斗争的、反对帝国主义发动新战争的人民的坚决抵抗。在艾森豪威尔留驻欧洲的期间，千百万人民的抗议运动，就没有一天停顿过。他们反对西德法西斯的再起，反对把他们的国家重新武装与重新军国主义化的计划。这仅仅是人民争取和平、争取人类未来的伟大斗争的开始！法、意、英和西德的统治者们用恫吓、暴力来镇压各国人民的运动，激起了日益增长的震怒和愤慨，而且引起了范围更为广大的保卫和平的群众运动。社论指出，全世界争取和平的斗争的强有力的高涨，给有组织的和平运动提出了责任重大的新任务，也就是有关进一步扩大这个运动的群众基础，进一步增加全国性与地方性和平委员会的活动的任务——有关巩固这些委员会的组织，有关在争取和平的斗争中加强它们作用和发展它们的主动性的任务。社论指出，法、意、西德、英国和其他国家的和平斗士们，现在正在采取重要的步骤来组织更多的地方性委员会，来吸收各阶层和各种政治倾向的代表到这些委员会里来，以及其他各种联系群众的方法。西德、英国、比利时和荷兰的和平斗士们，效法英勇的法国和平战士们，正在组织一个复决运动，正在请愿书上征集签名来反对西德的重整军备。各国共产党，站在和平斗士的前列，号召人民结成一个统一的阵线，反对西德的重整军备。他们向一切党组织指出，必须对广大群众解释，反对武装西德的斗争和反对武装它们本国的斗争是不可分的，反对武装西德的斗争也就是争取和平的斗争。社论最后称：世界和平运动在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，已经打了一连串的大胜仗。参加到这个运动的行列中来的新力量，每天都有增加。一切善良人民的力量进一步的巩固，他们的坚决维护和平的决心以及积极参加保卫和平运动的行动，将使美帝国主义者完全孤立，并将迫使战争贩子们退却。
    第七十七期以显著地位登载了波斯伯洛夫在莫斯科纪念列宁逝世二十七周年纪念会上的报告和沃达——柏克莎所作纪念斯大林著《论列宁主义的几个问题》二十五周年的题为《创造性的马克斯主义的杰出著作》的论文。此外，还登载了穆卡卓夫斯基教授的“捷克斯洛伐克第一届和平大会”、华斯的“匈牙利的经济蒸蒸日上”等论文。
