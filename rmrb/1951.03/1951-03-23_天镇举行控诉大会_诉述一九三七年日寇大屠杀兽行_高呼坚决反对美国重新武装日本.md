Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 20th. Tianzhen Dispatch: The people of Tianzhen County in Chahar Province held an accusation meeting in the county seat on March 3rd to oppose the United States' arming of Japan. Nearly three thousand people attended the meeting, and a demonstration parade followed.

At the meeting, everyone recounted with grief and indignation the bestial atrocities of the Japanese invaders' massacre in 1937. More than 4,000 people in Tianzhen County were killed in this massacre. More than 100 families were completely wiped out. The corpses filled five air-raid shelters, each three zhang deep, and seven large wells. Through this accusation of the Japanese invaders' atrocities, the people of Tianzhen County further realized that American imperialism is the most hateful enemy of the Chinese people today because it is rearming Japan to serve as a tool of aggression, preparing to carry out massacres again. Ren Dingguo, an old man who survived the Japanese invaders' massacre, opened his chest at the meeting, patted the scars from the stabbing, and said angrily: "If the devils come again, I will fight them with a kitchen knife."

After the meeting, a demonstration parade was held. Some elderly people in their seventies and eighties also participated in the parade, leaning on their crutches. People walked along the streets that had been washed with blood, shouting in unison slogans such as "Resolutely oppose the United States' rearming of Japan."

　　天镇举行控诉大会
    诉述一九三七年日寇大屠杀兽行 
    高呼坚决反对美国重新武装日本
    【新华社张家口二十日电】天镇讯：察哈尔省天镇县城人民于三月三日举行了反对美国武装日本的控诉大会。参加大会的近三千人，会后并游行示威。
    在这次大会上，大家悲愤地诉述着一九三七年日寇大屠杀的兽性暴行。天镇县城的人民在这次大屠杀中，被杀死了四千多人。全家被杀绝的有一百多户。尸体填满了五个三丈深的防空洞和七眼大井。天镇县城人民通过这次对日寇暴行的控诉，进一步认识到美帝国主义是中国人民当前最可恨的敌人，因为它正在把日本重新武装起来充当侵略工具，准备再来进行屠杀。在日寇大屠杀时幸免于难的老汉任定国，在会上袒开胸膛，拍着被刺伤的疤痕，他愤怒地说：“鬼子们再来，我拿菜刀也要和他们拚。”
    会后游行示威，有些七、八十岁的老人，也扶着拐杖参加了游行行列。人们走过一条条曾被血洗过的街道，齐声高呼“坚决反对美国重新武装日本”等口号。
