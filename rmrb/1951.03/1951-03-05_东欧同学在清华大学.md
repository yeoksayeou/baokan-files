　　Among the East European students from four countries studying in the "Chinese Language Training Class for Foreign Students," there are seven female students and fourteen male students. The youngest are the Romanian students, averaging twenty years old. The youngest, Luo Ming, is only nineteen years old this year. They had just graduated from high school in Bucharest before coming to Beijing. Among the four Hungarian students, three are university teaching assistants and one is a middle school teacher. The Bulgarian student, Ji Lianchuo, is thirty years old this year and considered the "big brother." His revolutionary experience is also the most extensive, having participated in guerrilla warfare and worked as a teacher at a Party school. Before coming to China, he was a university philosophy teaching assistant. All of these students are among the best young people in their countries, with outstanding achievements in both work and study.
　　In their home countries, they studied economics, philosophy, or other subjects, and had not studied Chinese. They are now encountering this "musical language" for the first time. Foreigners learning Chinese characters face difficulties that we cannot imagine. Many sounds do not exist in their languages. In terms of teaching methods, we cannot use the method we used when we were children learning block characters. When they started learning, pronunciation tutorials were the main subject. Two months were spent laying a good foundation. Before class, handouts are distributed, and the four tones are practiced using Romanized pronunciation: high and low, strong and weak, rising and falling; and some clear, convenient, and interesting short phrases are selected for initial practice, such as "Qing--hua--yuan--," "Dou--ya--cai--." A recording is made every month to compare their pronunciation progress. Therefore, they can quickly and accurately grasp the rules of pronunciation. They have learned "The East is Red" and "Northern Shaanxi Folk Song." The next stage of the course material mainly consists of simple conversations. The plan is to enable them to read newspapers and popular books within one year.
　　The twenty-one people are divided into two groups. During class, the Bulgarian and Romanian students are in one group using Russian translation, and the remaining group uses English explanation. Study time is from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm, and 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm is writing class. In writing class, they learn to write Chinese radicals, such as a dot, a stroke, three water dots, wood radical, etc.; each radical is followed by example characters for practice. They work very hard at writing and achieve good results. The Chinese nameplates on their dormitory doors were written by themselves.
　　They all have a positive spirit to overcome difficulties in their studies. The Romanian student, Liao Ning, does not pronounce correctly, and since the Polish students arrived late, he automatically asked to start learning from scratch with them.
　　They like sports very much, but the timing doesn't work out well. Their habit is to exercise in the morning, but the gymnasium has to clean the sports equipment in the morning, so they can only play with the students from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm. They like our folk songs and folk dances very much, especially the锣鼓 [luó gǔ - gongs and drums] and秧歌 [yāng gē - a popular rural folk dance]. At the welcome dance party hosted by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, they said in Chinese: "Now let's do the秧歌!" So, the dance floor resounded with "Qiang, qiang, qi qiang qi" [sound of the folk dance]. Once, when Jiang Dongni heard the students singing "The Song of Mao Zedong," she was reluctant to leave. They very much hope that the students—especially those who can speak Beijing dialect and the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members—will be close to them. They also want the workers to be their friends.
　　They have boundless respect and love for our ancient and great Chinese nation with its rich cultural heritage. The Nine Dragon Wall, the Long Corridor, and the 秧歌 are their favorite things, and they think they are the best works of art. When visiting the Summer Palace, they cherish every work of art created by the Chinese working people. They all use notebooks to record what they see and decide to take pictures of every building, every piece of art, and every corner during the summer vacation and send them back to their own countries as valuable materials for studying Chinese art. They watched Mei Lanfang's Peking Opera and also watched plays. A Hungarian female student likes the lovable character "Yi Tiao Cha" ["A Prickly Branch"] in the play "The Enemy Without Guns" very much. She wants to write a letter back home to tell her friends about the art of the Chinese people that she has learned. They love our nation and our art so much! The significance of cultural exchanges between China and the people's democratic countries is very great.

　　东欧同学在清华大学
    清华大学通讯组  程默
    在“外籍学生中国语文专修班”学习的东欧四国同学中，有七位女同学十四位男同学。其中最年轻的要算罗马尼亚同学，平均是二十岁。最年青的小弟弟罗明今年才十九岁。他们都是刚由布加勒斯特的中学毕业就来到北京的。匈牙利四位同学中有三位大学助教，一位中学教员。保加利亚的季连绰同学，今年三十岁，算是老大哥了。他的革命经历也最丰富，曾参加过游击战争，做过党校的教师。在来到中国以前，他是大学哲学助教。所有这些同学都是他们国家中最优秀的青年，无论在工作上、学习上都有着优异的成绩。
    在国内，他们学的是经济、哲学或其他学科，都没有研究过中文。他们现在是第一次接触这“富有音乐性的语文”。外国人学汉字是有我们所料想不到的困难的。有许多音都是他们所没有的。在教学方法上，不能用我们启蒙时念方块字的那种方法。他们开始学习时，以发音教程为主要科目。两个月的时间都用在打好这个基础上。在上课前就发好讲义，用罗马字拼音练好四声：高低强弱，抑扬顿挫；并选用一些发音清晰、方便而有趣的短语先来练习，如“清——华——园——”，“豆——芽——菜——”。每月灌一次录音片来比较他们发音的进度。因此，他们都能很快又很正确地掌握了发音规律。他们学会了“东方红”和“陕北情歌”。下一阶段的课程教材主要的是简单的会话。计划在一年之内使他们能够阅读报纸和通俗的书籍。
    二十一人分为两组。在上课时，保、罗同学一组用俄文翻译，其余一组用英文讲解。学习时间是上午九点到下午一点，晚上六点半到七点半是写字课。写字课上，学写中文的部首，如一点、一撇、三点水、木字旁等；每个部首后面都有练习的字例。他们对写字非常努力，成绩很好，寝室门上的中文名牌就是他们自己写的。
    在学习上他们都有克服困难的积极精神。罗马尼亚的廖宁同学发音不太正确，刚好波兰同学来的晚，他就自动地要求与他们一块从头学起。
    他们非常喜欢运动，只是时间不凑合。他们的习惯是在上午运动，而体育馆上午要清理运动器具，只能在下午五点到六点和同学们一起玩一下。他们很喜欢我们的民歌民舞，特别是锣鼓和秧歌舞。在青年团中央主持的欢迎舞会上，他们用中国话说：“现在来扭秧歌！”于是，舞场上响起了一片“强，强，起强起”的声音。有一次江冬妮同学听同学们唱“毛泽东之歌”，舍不得走开。他们非常希望同学们——特别是会说北京话的同学和共产党员、青年团员同志们——跟他们亲近。他们还要工友同志做他们的朋友。
    他们对我们这个古老而伟大，有着丰富文化遗产的中华民族怀着无限的崇敬与爱戴。九龙碑、长廊、秧歌都是他们最喜爱的，他们认为它们都是最好的艺术品。在游颐和园时，他们珍视中国劳动人民所创造的每一件艺术品。他们都用笔记本记下他们所看到的东西，并决定到暑假把每一座建筑物，每一件艺术品，每一个角落都拍成照片寄回自己祖国去，作为研究中国艺术的珍贵材料。他们看了梅兰芳的京剧，也看了话剧。匈牙利的一位女同学，非常喜欢《不拿枪的敌人》中的“一条杈”这个可爱的人物。她要写信回国，把她所了解的中国人民的艺术告诉她的朋友们。他们这样热爱我们的民族和我们的艺术！中国和各人民民主国家的文化交流的意义是非常重大的。
