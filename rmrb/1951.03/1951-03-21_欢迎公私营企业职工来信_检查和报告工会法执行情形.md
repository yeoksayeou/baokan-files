　　Welcome Letters from Employees of Public and Private Enterprises
    Inspect and Report on the Implementation of the Trade Union Law
    Editor's Note: According to letters from readers in various regions, the implementation of the Trade Union Law in many public and private enterprises is still not satisfactory. Even in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, which was liberated earlier, there are still many serious problems, which should arouse vigilance in various regions. In order to deeply understand and study the problems existing in the implementation of the Trade Union Law in public and private enterprises, and to promote the implementation of the Trade Union Law, the Reader's Page will, in the future, regularly publish reports on the implementation and inspection of the Trade Union Law in various public and private enterprises with greater coverage. We hope that worker comrades, trade union workers, and readers who care about the interests of the working class will send us more letters, reporting on the situation and problems related to this aspect in your factory and the enterprises you know, so as to form a mass inspection in the newspaper and promote the earnest implementation of the Trade Union Law.
    Many Public and Private Enterprises in Shijiazhuang Prefecture
    Seriously Violate the Trade Union Law
    Hoping Relevant Authorities Conduct Thorough Inspection and Correction To the Editor:
    In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, many public and private enterprises, as well as the leadership at the county and town levels, have a poor implementation of the Trade Union Law. The various rights of workers are not adequately guaranteed, seriously affecting the development of production.
    Some administrative management personnel in public enterprises and factories in the prefecture mistakenly believe that the Trade Union Law only benefits workers and has nothing to do with them. They delay implementing the Trade Union Law; some deprive workers of their rights, restrict workers' activities, or emphasize that the circumstances of their departments are special, seeking excuses for not implementing the Trade Union Law. This is even more serious in private enterprises. The trade union of the Gongying Ginning Factory of the Jin County Cotton Production Improvement Office wrote to the county Federation of Trade Unions in January this year, hoping to promote the factory to establish a factory management committee so that the trade union could represent employees in participating in production management. This request is entirely reasonable and is expressly stipulated in Article 5 of the Trade Union Law. However, An Hesheng, the manager of the factory, angrily summoned the trade union cadre Gao Rong, slammed the table, and scolded Gao Rong for writing to the county trade union without his approval. When the Gongying Iron Factory in Xinji Town elected members of the factory management committee, the number of elected worker representatives exceeded the number of staff representatives. The administration, fearing that it would be difficult to control later, privately changed it so that there were more staff representatives than worker representatives, which is a full expression of distrust of the workers. A private shoe factory in Zhengding, dissatisfied with the trade union cadres in its factory, used the means of "suspending business" to send all the workers (including trade union cadres) home, and then "resumed business," only recalling the workers and achieving the purpose of dismissing trade union cadres. Many enterprises delay in remitting the trade union dues stipulated by the Trade Union Law, and some, although they have begun to remit, have not yet implemented the method of concentrating the dues to the county Federation of Trade Unions for unified use as instructed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    Some enterprises and institutions do not have a clear understanding of the idea of relying on workers to improve production, do not adopt workers' reasonable suggestions, and do not protect workers' safety. The Zhengding Gongying Weifeng Ginning Factory forced workers to burn an eighty-pound steam boiler to one hundred pounds, and a twelve-horsepower engine was run at seventeen and a half horsepower for a long time. When technician Shi Zhenhai raised objections, Section Chief Wang Fufang refused to listen and insulted the workers. Pu Qinggong, manager of the coal factory of the Gaocheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, forced workers to stack bean cakes beyond the regulations, reaching a height of two zhang and five chi, injuring two workers. When the workers gave him their opinions, he said: "It doesn't matter if two people are killed, there are plenty of workers." Individual factories even infringe on workers' human rights and freedom, insulting and beating workers. The Jin County Gongying Ginning Factory still retains the "body search" system.
    The phenomenon of excessive overtime and disregard for workers' health and welfare is also very common. The Zhengding Joint Shoe Factory works overtime for fourteen hours without paying overtime pay to the workers. After the Zhengding County Gongying Weifeng Ginning Factory launched a patriotic competition in December last year, the output increased by more than 20% compared with October and November. The factory not only did not reward the workers, but Section Chief Wang Fufang, who had always oppressed the workers, instead turned around and asked the workers: "Why did you gin less in October and November?" and asked the workers to compensate for the losses. During the three months of the patriotic production competition in the Gaocheng County Gongying Winery, the cost was reduced by 120,000 jin of millet. The trade union had repeatedly suggested that the administration give the workers appropriate rewards. It was not until February this year that the workers were rewarded with 1,000 jin of rice. Many places do not implement the wage payment standards stipulated by the Government Administration Council. For example, in a private shoe factory in Zhengding, rice is issued when the rice price is cheap, and money is issued when the rice price is expensive.
    Most county party and government leaders have not yet included trade union work on the agenda. Some not only do not help trade union work, but also frequently transfer trade union cadres to do other work.
    Based on the above situation, we suggest that the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Commissioner's Office, and the Office of the Prefectural Trade Union instruct the party, government, trade unions, and relevant departments at all levels to seriously inspect the problems that have occurred in various places and handle them promptly and effectively in accordance with the principles of the Trade Union Law.
                                      A group of worker readers from Hebei Province
    Editor's Note: The violations of the Trade Union Law in Shijiazhuang Prefecture reflected by the worker readers are serious. Please have the relevant authorities conduct an inspection and reply immediately.
   Taiyuan City Should Further Inspect the Implementation of the Trade Union Law To the Editor:
    Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, the Taiyuan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has widely launched the study of the Trade Union Law among the workers in the city. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government also issued an order on August 21, 1950, to "earnestly implement the Trade Union Law." Therefore, most public enterprises in the city have achieved certain results in the implementation of the Trade Union Law. However, at present, the administration and capitalists of some factories and mines still emphasize objective reasons and are unwilling to implement the Trade Union Law. As a result, violations of the Trade Union Law are still quite serious, mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    1. Regarding the issue of remitting trade union dues. The Gongying Xinsheng Construction Company, led by the Taiyuan Municipal Government Construction Bureau, refused to remit trade union dues on the pretext that their business was military and municipal construction. The Gongying Shanxi Construction Company only remitted the trade union dues of some employees. After the trade union found out, the administration claimed that it "did not understand." The Gongying Xin Da Company refused to pay trade union dues on the pretext that the superior authorities had not stipulated this expenditure. The capitalists of Huifeng Construction Company, Kaiming, Tongpu and other photo studios all claimed that "business is bad and there is no money to remit trade union dues." In fact, the business of the photo studios is very good. The 44 employees in the watch and clock industry should have remitted 1.08 million yuan in trade union dues from August to December last year, but only 265,200 yuan was actually remitted.
    2. Regarding the issue of dismissing and transferring workers. In Taiyuan City, there is still a serious phenomenon of administrative or capitalists using dismissal as a means to obstruct workers from joining trade unions, undermine the prestige of trade unions, and deprive workers of their political freedom. For example, when the construction trade union mobilized workers to organize trade unions, Li Zepu, manager of the Gongying Yongmao Construction Company, threatened workers after he learned about it, saying: "If you participate in trade union meetings again, I will fire you." With the support of the trade union, the workers of the company participated in trade union meetings. The company finally fired 27 people, including trade union committee members Wan Peihong and Feng Zenshan. The private Zhonghe Chemical Factory illegally dismissed seven workers in February. When the trade union raised objections, the manager of the factory threatened the trade union with words such as "If they are here, I won't open this factory." The Shanxi Construction Company, Tongzhen and Yuyuan Cotton Weaving Factories, the Gongji Factory in the machine industry, and the Xinsheng, Xietong, Yisheng and other kiln industries do not notify the trade union when hiring and dismissing workers.
    3. Working hours and safety issues. Workers in the private Zhengtong Cotton Weaving Factory work as long as fifteen hours. In order to protect the workers' health, the trade union requested the capitalists to reduce working hours, but the capitalists have not yet implemented it. The private Yu Da Iron Factory has dilapidated houses that are in danger of collapsing at any time. After the trade union and the Municipal Labor Bureau raised opinions and requested repairs, the capitalists were only perfunctory.
    Therefore, I suggest that the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal Government should organize all personnel of various public and private enterprises and cadres of other relevant institutions again, combine the inspection of actual work, deeply study and strictly implement the Trade Union Law.
                                            Reader Wang Guilin
    Editor's Note: We fully agree with Wang Guilin's opinion.
   Why Has the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau Been Delaying the Payment of Trade Union Dues? To the Editor:
    Three months ago, we criticized in the Workers' Daily the Beijing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau for delaying the payment of trade union dues to the municipal hospitals in Beijing on the pretext. In response, the Health Bureau not only did not review its own work, but instead sent the chief of the accounting section angrily to the office of the First District Trade Union, saying that our criticism was unreasonable, saying that it was not their responsibility not to give trade union dues, but that the Finance Bureau did not approve it (however, the municipal hospitals have no direct leadership relationship with the Finance Bureau), and that we should not have criticized them in the newspaper without contacting them in advance. In fact, before we made the criticism in the newspaper, we had already written directly to the person in charge of the Health Bureau, requesting the Health Bureau to allocate trade union dues to the municipal hospitals in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law and raising other issues related to employee welfare. According to our understanding: after receiving the letter, the Health Bureau's departments shirked each other, and as a result, no one cared. Now, three months have passed since the criticism in the newspaper, and the problem has not been resolved. On March 13, the municipal hospitals in the city all received a notice from the Health Bureau, the content of which was: (1) Due to questions about the trade union dues for 1951, we have requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance, and we will handle it after receiving a reply. (2) The book and newspaper fees already received in the previous months of 1950 should be deducted from the trade union dues in full. From September, the trade union dues to be supplemented in each month can be collected by submitting documents to the bureau. Based on the above official documents, we believe that the Trade Union Law has been promulgated for almost nine months, but the Health Bureau still has questions about the trade union dues. I don't know what this question is? Secondly, we believe that deducting book and newspaper fees is not appropriate. Book and newspaper fees are an administrative expenditure and have nothing to do with trade union dues. It is a concrete manifestation of disregarding the trade union to force administrative expenses to be paid from trade union dues without the consent of the trade union.
          Liu Ling, Office of the First District, Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions
    Editor's Note: The issue of delayed payment of trade union dues is not a simple economic procedure issue, but should be regarded as a basic attitude towards the working class organization. The Trade Union Law has been promulgated, and the Beijing Health Bureau must resolutely implement it and should not make any exceptions.

专栏：读者来信专页

　　欢迎公私营企业职工来信
    检查和报告工会法执行情形
    编者按：根据各地读者来信，有许多公私营企业对工会法的执行至今仍不能令人满意。甚至像解放较久的石家庄专区仍然存在着许多严重问题，是应当引起各地警惕的。为了深入地了解与研究公私营企业在执行工会法中所存在的问题，推动工会法的执行，今后读者专页决以较大篇幅，经常发表各地公私营企业有关工会法的执行和检查情况。希望工人同志们、工会工作者及关心工人阶级利益的读者多多来信，报告你厂及你所了解的企业单位有关这方面的情况和问题，以便在报纸上形成一个群众性的检查，借以推进工会法的认真执行。
    石家庄专区不少公私营企业
    严重违犯工会法
    望有关机关深入检查纠正编辑同志：
    河北省石家庄专区不少公私营企业和县、镇领导上，对工会法执行很差，工人的各种权利得不到应有的保障，严重影响着生产的发展。
    该专区部分公营企业工厂的行政管理人员，错误地认为工会法只对工人有利，与自己无关，对工会法拖延不执行；有的则剥夺工人权利，限制工人活动，或强调自己部门情况特殊，寻找不执行工会法的借口。在私营企业中则表现得更为严重。晋县棉产改进处公营轧花厂工会，今年一月向县总工会写信，希望推动厂方组织工厂管理委员会，以便工会代表职工参加生产管理。这种要求完全是合理的，是工会法第五条上明文规定的。但该厂经理安贺生反将工会干部高荣叫去拍案大骂，责备高荣向县工会写信没经他批准。辛集镇公营铁工厂选举工厂管理委员会的委员时，当选的工人代表超过职员代表的数目。行政上怕以后不好掌握，便私自改变成职员代表多于工人代表，这是不相信工人的充分表现。正定一家私人鞋厂，对本厂工会干部不满，用“歇业”的手段把全体工人（包括工会干部）打发回家，然后又“复业”，只把工人找回，达到了解雇工会干部的目的。工会法规定的按月拨交工会经费，很多企业拖延不交，有的虽已开始拨交，但还没按全国总工会指示集中交县总工会统一使用的办法执行。
    部分企业机关，对依靠工人搞好生产的思想很不明确，不采纳工人的合理建议，不保护工人的安全。正定公营伟丰轧花厂，硬让工人把八十磅汽锅炉烧到一百磅，十二马力的马力机长时间开到十七个半马力。技工史振海提出意见时，王福芳科长不听，反辱骂工人。藁城县供销社煤厂经理普庆公，逼使工人垒垛豆饼超过规程达二丈五尺高，摔坏两个工人，工人给他提意见，他却说：“摔死两个人没关系，有的是工人。”个别的工厂并侵犯工人人权自由，侮辱拷打工人。晋县公营轧花厂还残留着“搜身”制度。
    过度加班加点不注意工人健康和工人福利的现象也很普遍。正定联营鞋厂加班到十四个钟头，不给工人发加班费。正定县公营伟丰轧花厂去年十二月份开展爱国主义竞赛后，产量较十、十一两月提高百分之二十以上。该厂对工人不但不予奖励，一贯压迫工人的王福芳科长反而倒打一耙问工人：“为什么十、十一两月轧的少？”叫工人赔偿损失。藁城县公营酒厂在爱国主义生产竞赛的三个月内，降低成本十二万斤小米，工会曾几次建议行政给工人以适当奖励。迟至今年二月，才奖给工人一千斤米。很多地方不按照政务院规定的工资支付标准执行。如正定私营鞋厂，米价贱了发米，米价贵了发款。
    大部县份党政领导还没把工会工作列到议事日程，有的不但不帮助工会工作，反经常抽调工会干部去作其他工作。
    根据上述情形，我们建议中共石家庄地委、专署及专区工会办事处，指示所属各级党、政、工会及有关部门，认真检查各地所发生的问题，根据工会法的原则，迅速有效地进行处理。
                                      河北省一群工人读者
    编者按：工人读者们反映的石家庄专区违犯工会法的情况是严重的，请有关机关即作检查答复。
   太原市应进一步检查工会法的执行编辑同志：
    自从工会法颁布以来，太原市总工会便在全市的工人群众中普遍展开对工会法的学习。山西省人民政府也于一九五○年八月二十一日发出“认真执行工会法”的通令。因而全市大部分公营企业在执行工会法方面有了一定的成绩。但目前仍有部分厂矿的行政和资方强调客观原因，不愿执行工会法。以致违反工会法的现象还相当严重，主要表现在下列几方面：
    一、关于拨缴工会经费问题。太原市政府建设局领导的公营新生建筑公司，借口他们的业务系军事及市政建设，拒绝拨交工会费。公营山西建筑公司只拨交一部分职工的工会费，经工会查出后，行政上推说“不了解”。公营新大公司借口上级未规定此项开支，拒缴工会经费。惠丰建筑公司，开明、同蒲等照像馆的资方均借口“营业不好没钱拨交工会费”。实际上照像馆营业都很好。钟表业四十四个职工由去年八月到十二月应拨交工会费一百零八万元，实际上只拨交二十六万五千二百元。
    二、关于解雇和调动工人问题。太原市现在还严重地存在着行政或资方以解雇手段来阻挠工人参加工会、打击工会威信、剥夺工人政治自由等现象。如建筑工会发动工人组织工会时，公营永茂建筑公司经理李泽浦知道后，威胁工人说：“你们再参加工会开会，我就开除你们。”该公司工人在工会支持下，参加了工会开会。公司终于把工会委员万培宏、冯振善等二十七人开除了。私营中和化学厂在二月间前后非法解雇工人七名。工会提出反对意见时，该厂经理用“有他们，我这厂子就不开了”等话来威胁工会。山西建筑公司，同祯、裕源棉织工厂，机器业工记工厂，新生、协同、义生等烘炉业，雇用和解雇工人都不通知工会。
    三、工作时间与安全问题。私营正同棉织工厂工人工作时间长达十五小时。工会为了保护工人的身体健康，要求资方应减少工时，但资方至今仍未执行。私营裕大铁工厂房子破烂，随时都有倒塌的危险。经工会和市劳动局提出意见要求修理，资方只是敷衍了事。
    因此，我建议中共太原市委及市政府应再组织各公私营全部人员及其他有关机关的干部，结合对实际工作的检查，深入学习和严格执行工会法。
                                            读者  王桂林
    编者按：我们完全同意王桂林的意见。
   北京市卫生局为何迟迟不交工会经费？编辑同志：
    在三个月前，我们曾在工人日报上批评北京市人民政府卫生局借故拖延拨交北京市各市立医院的工会经费。对此，卫生局不但不检讨自己的工作，反而派会计股长怒气冲冲地到一区工会办事处来，说我们批评的不合理，说不给工会经费的不是他们的责任，是财政局不批准（可是，各市立医院与财政局并无直接领导关系），不该事先不与他们联系就在报上批评了他们。事实上，当我们在报上进行批评之前，早就直接给卫生局负责人写过信，要求卫生局按工会法规定拨给各市立医院的工会经费并提出其他有关职工福利问题。据我们了解：卫生局接到信后各科互相推诿，结果谁都不管。现在距离报上批评的时间，又过去了三个月，问题还一直没有解决。三月十三日本市各市立医院，都接到卫生局的通知，内容是：（一）一九五一年度工会经费因尚有疑问，经向财政部请示，俟奉批复后再行核办。（二）一九五○年度各月份已领之书报费应如数在工会费内扣除，自九月份起，其各月应行补拨之工会费可持据来局具领。根据以上公文，我们认为：工会法公布已经快九个月了，可是卫生局对工会经费尚有疑问之处，不晓得这个疑问究竟是什么？其次，我们认为扣除书报费是不应该的。书报费是行政上的一笔开支，与工会经费丝毫没有关系。不经工会的同意，硬要把行政上的费用由工会经费中开支，这是轻视工会的具体表现。
          北京市总工会一区办事处  刘令
    编者按：迟交工会费的问题，不是单纯的经济手续问题，而应看作是对待工人阶级组织的基本态度问题。工会法已经颁布，北京卫生局必须坚决执行而不应有所例外。
