　　Introducing "Shangrao Concentration Camp"

　　The film "Shangrao Concentration Camp," compiled by Comrade Feng Xuefeng, is a film that records a dark period in Chinese history through artistic images. It is a historical fact containing the greatest hatred and heroic struggle of the Chinese people, a blood-soaked history.
　　The Southern Anhui Incident of 1941 is a sign of this shameful history. Under the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek, the fascist bandits who ruled China by betraying and killing the Chinese people launched a shameless attack on the New Fourth Army, the people's anti-Japanese armed forces led by the Chinese Communist Party. They exhausted all kinds of vicious methods to frame the heroic people who resisted Japan and patriotic youths, throwing captured New Fourth Army cadres and other patriotic people into concentration camps, and then massacring them batch after batch. They exhausted the most cruel tortures to torment and humiliate the anti-Japanese people, attempting to subdue them and turn them into traitors and glory-seeking slaves like the fascist executioners. Through this historical subject matter, the film "Shangrao Concentration Camp" truthfully records this monstrous crime left by the Kuomintang fascists in Chinese history.
　　However, no matter how brutal and shameless the Chiang Kai-shek gang was, it was impossible for them to make the Chinese people submit. Because the awakened Chinese people had already realized their own strength. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they found the truth and saw the free, happy, and glorious future of the people. For these, they were able to be unyielding and fearless in the face of brutal executioners. Through several prominent characters, the film vividly portrays the unyielding image of the Chinese people. Shi Zhen, a captured New Fourth Army soldier, was only seventeen years old. After being captured, she was gang-raped by the Kuomintang fascist beasts to the point of near death. She lay on the hospital bed of the concentration camp with a body so thin that only a skeleton remained. She endured unprecedented humiliation and terror. The fascist beasts tried to deceive her into surrendering by pretending to treat her illness, but she didn't even want to answer them. She said: "I wanted to commit suicide more than ten times. However, I thought that I was only seventeen years old, that the Japanese devils had not yet been driven out, that the Kuomintang reactionaries had not yet been eliminated, and that our revenge had not yet been avenged! I thought of our work, our Party, Chairman Mao, our dear comrades, the freedom of the motherland, and the happy days to come..." Even when the brutal beasts finally tied her with stones and pushed her into the deep pool of the valley, a smile still floated on her face. Another prominent figure in the film, Li Hua, was buried alive in the wilderness at night because he refused to yield to the enemy. The executioners wanted to subdue him with death, but even when the soil was buried to his neck, he was still unyielding. Zhao Hong, a senior cadre of the New Fourth Army, was subjected to various threats and inducements by the enemy in the concentration camp to publicly declare his separation from the Communist Party, and he could be given important jobs and positions. Finally, he was forced to surrender with a fabricated "anti-communist declaration," but Zhao Hong said to them: "But what's the use of this? ... This can only prove your shamelessness, your failure!" In order to highlight the image of these heroic figures, the film also depicts many supporting characters, especially the moving portrayal of the character Su Lin. This is a young girl, a primary school teacher who was arrested from the local area by the Kuomintang bandits and brought to the concentration camp. When she and Shi Zhen were together and heard many things Shi Zhen said, she said to Shi Zhen: "I will learn from you, I will learn from everyone! I used to think like this: I am not a Communist Party member, I was arrested wrongly, so I am suffering here more wrongly. But now I understand! As long as these Kuomintang fascists exist for one day, our people, our youth, no matter which one, will not have a day of freedom!..." What sincere words! These are the words spoken by this primary school teacher, personally experienced by thousands of Chinese youths and thousands of Chinese people in their lives and in their struggles.
　　The film's portrayal of these characters is successful, because the characters portrayed in the film are all flesh-and-blood characters. What is embodied in them is not just one or two people, but thousands of such Chinese people. From these true character images, we deeply experience the great character of the Chinese people, and from here we gain encouragement and gain education.

　　介绍《上饶集中营》
    李申
    冯雪峰同志所编的电影《上饶集中营》，是一部通过艺术的形象来记录中国一段最黑暗的历史的电影。那是一段包含着中国人民的最大的仇恨和英勇斗争的史实，一段鲜血淋漓的历史。
    一九四一年的皖南事变，就是这一段耻辱的历史的标志。以卖国及杀害中国人民来统治中国的法西斯匪帮，在蒋介石的阴谋布置下，对中国共产党所领导的人民抗日武装新四军进行了一次无耻的袭击。他们用尽各种凶残的办法来陷害抗日的英雄的人民以及爱国的青年，将被捕的新四军的干部人员及其他爱国的人民投入集中营，然后一批批的屠杀。他们用尽人间最残忍的酷刑来折磨及污辱抗日的人民，企图以此来屈服他们，使他们变成和法西斯刽子手们一样的卖国求荣的奴才。通过这一个历史的题材，影片《上饶集中营》真实地记录了国民党法西斯在中国历史上所留下的这一段滔天的罪行。
    然而不管蒋介石匪帮如何凶残与无耻，他们要使中国人民屈服，那是不可能的。因为觉醒了的中国人民，已经认识了自己的力量。由于中国共产党的领导使他们找到了真理，看见了人民的自由、幸福和光荣的前途。为了这些，使他们在凶残的刽子手面前能够坚贞不屈，无所畏惧。影片通过几个突出的人物，淋漓尽致地表现了中国人民的坚贞不屈的形象。在新四军的被俘的施珍，年纪只有十七岁，被俘以后为国民党法西斯野兽们轮奸得快死了。她带着瘦得仅剩一副骨架子的身体躺在集中营的病床上。她经受了从没有经历过的污辱和恐怖。法西斯野兽们想用给她治病的欺骗来使她自首，但是她连回答也不想回答他们。她说：“我不止十次想自杀。可是，我想到我还只有十七岁，想到日本鬼子还没有打出去，想到国民党反动派还没有被消灭，我们的仇还没有报！想到我们的工作，想到我们的党，想到毛主席，想到亲爱的同志们，想到祖国的自由，将来幸福的日子……”一直到凶残的野兽最后把她捆着石头推到山谷的深潭里去，她的脸上仍然浮着微笑。影片中的另一个突出的人物李华，因为对敌人毫不屈服，刽子手们想以死来折服他，在黑夜的荒野里来把他活埋，可是就是当泥土埋到他的脖子上的时候，他也还是毫不屈服。影片中的赵宏，是一位新四军的高级干部，在集中营里，敌人用尽各种威胁利诱的办法来要他公开表示脱离共产党，可以给他重要的工作和地位，最后用假造的“反共宣言”来胁迫他投降，但是赵宏对他们说：“可是，这又有什么用呢？……这只能证明你们的无耻，你们的失败！”为了突出地表现这些英雄人物的形象，在影片里还描写了许多衬托的人物，特别动人的是对苏琳这个人物的描写。这是一个年青的女孩子，从地方上被国民党匪帮抓到集中营来的一个小学教员，当她和施珍两个人在一起，听了施珍所说的许多话以后，她向施珍说：“我向你学习，向你们大家学习！我当初还这样想过：我不是共产党员，我是冤枉被捕的，所以我在这里受罪是多冤屈。但是现在我懂得了！这些国民党法西斯存在一天，我们人民，我们青年，无论那一个，就都没有自由的一天！………”多么真切的话呵！这是中国千万青年，千万人民在他们的生活中，在他们的斗争中所亲自体验而从这一位小学教员口中所说出来的话。
    影片对于这些人物的刻画是成功的，因为从影片里所表现的这些人物，都是有血有肉的人物。从他们身上所体现的，不只是一个人两个人，而是千万个这样的中国的人民。从这些真切的人物形象的身上，使我们深深体验了中国人民的伟大的性格，并从这里获得了鼓励，获得了教育。
