To the Editor:

　　The privately-owned Yuanling Hua Feng Cloth Store in Hunan Province, in response to the government's call to "face the countryside," organized a "Rural Service Team" in December of last year, carrying over 10 million yuan worth of various fabrics to Tingliu Town, upstream of the Yuan River. There is a coal mine in this area with approximately two hundred workers and their families, as well as some small villages nearby. Because merchants rarely come here to sell goods, the masses find it very inconvenient to purchase daily industrial necessities. When the service team arrived in Tingliu, they were welcomed by the local masses and warmly received by the director of the farmers' association, who arranged accommodation and a place for them to do business. The team also did business with a spirit of truly serving the farmers. For example, better quality Qihe Sulan cloth was sold for 79,000 yuan per bolt, and slightly inferior cloth was sold for 77,000 yuan, only 2,000 yuan higher than the listed price at the Yuanling Department Store. This was because they paid attention to saving expenses along the way, carrying goods themselves at docks and when selling cloth at market fairs, so that costs would not increase too much. During the sales process, they encountered great difficulties because the local area lacked Renminbi (here, things are mostly bartered, and the mine also mostly pays wages in rice). They discussed this with the farmers' association and the mine. Because the coal mine greatly needed tea oil (for consumption), the service team exchanged cloth for tea oil with the farmers, and then gave the tea oil to the coal mine, which issued them a receipt to collect money from the Yuanling Power Plant. Their spirit of serving the people was welcomed by the workers and farmers. Recently, local farmers even wrote to the store, asking them to bring more goods to sell. As for themselves, December is the off-season for cloth stores, but by going deep into the countryside to do business, they also solved some of their own difficulties.

　　深入农村和矿区沅陵华丰布店受到群众欢迎编辑同志：
    湖南沅陵县私营华丰布店，为了响应政府“面向农村”的号召，在去年十二月间，组织了“农村服务小组”，携带价值一千余万元的各色布匹，到沅江上游的汀流镇。该地有煤矿一处，工人及眷属约二百余人，附近还有些小的村庄。因为平常很少有商人到这里售货，群众购买工业日用品很感不便。当该服务组到达汀流后，受到了当地群众的欢迎及农会主任的殷勤招待，为他们安顿了住宿和营业的地方。该组也以真正为农民服务的精神来做买卖，像较好的漆河苏蓝布每匹七万九千元，次一点卖七万七千元，都只比沅陵百货公司的牌价高二千元。这是因为他们在沿途都注意到节省开支，在上下码头及赶场卖布都由自己搬运，使成本不会增加太多。在卖货当中，他们遇到了很大的困难，因为当地缺乏人民币（这里买东西，多是以货易货，矿上发工资也多发米），他们就和农会及矿方商量，因为煤矿很需要茶油（可供食用），服务组就拿布和农民换茶油，再把茶油交给煤矿，由矿上开给他们收条，到沅陵发电厂去取款。他们这种为人民服务的精神，受到了工人和农民的欢迎，最近当地农民还给该店去信，请他们再带货去卖。对于他们自己来说呢？十二月份是布店的淡月，但由于他们深入农村去做买卖，也解决了他们自己的一些困难。
