    Chen Xianfan of the East China Textile Administration Bureau Abuses Power for Personal Gain
    People's Supervision Committee Has Handled It According to Law
    Chen Xianfan, Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, abused his power, colluded with individual backward technical personnel and illegal private merchants, engaged in malfeasance, causing serious damage to state property and the reputation of state-owned enterprises. The Central People's Supervision Committee has submitted to the State Council for approval the removal of Chen Xianfan and his accomplices Lin Tianyou and Wu Tongzhao from their positions, and handed them over to judicial organs for punishment according to law, ordering them to compensate for state losses. The Central People's Supervision Committee has also urged the East China Textile Administration Bureau to submit private merchants who colluded with Chen Xianfan to the People's Court for investigation and prosecution according to law and to recover the state's losses.
    Chen Xianfan was originally the Chief Engineer and Director of the Printing and Dyeing Department of the pseudo-China Textile Company. After the liberation of Shanghai, he continued to serve as the Chief Engineer of the China Textile Company and concurrently as the Chief of the Processing Section of the Manufacturing Department; in July 1950, he was also promoted to Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, directly responsible for leading printing, dyeing, processing, and pigment chemical analysis. He had engaged in corruption before liberation; after liberation, he did not repent and continued to engage in malfeasance. The main facts of corruption that have been verified are as follows:
    Chen Xianfan and his wife, Qin Zhenqiu, established the Zhenda Chemical Factory and used Chen's position to directly and indirectly sell low-quality pigments to the East China Textile Administration Bureau at high prices. For example, in December 1949, the Zhenda Chemical Factory sold 100 dan of vulcanized yuan to the First Knitting Factory of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, with a quality of only about 75% of the standard goods, priced at 46.94 million yuan. According to the quality of the goods and general prices, the First Knitting Factory lost 13.14 million yuan. Zhenda Chemical Factory did not have much capital, but due to Chen's abuse of power and corruption, it obtained extremely high profits; according to the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, the factory's inventory of printing and dyeing raw materials, including foreign orders, was estimated to be worth more than 3 billion yuan.
    Chen Xianfan has close personal relationships with five pigment firms in Shanghai: Damao, Xingchang, Yuanda, Jiaxing, and Yongye. Therefore, these five firms have become the main suppliers of pigments for the East China Textile Administration Bureau. Damao's total sales in 1949 were 965 million yuan, of which the transaction volume with the East China Textile Administration Bureau reached 536 million yuan; from January to April 1950, the total sales were 1.111 billion yuan, of which the transaction volume with the East China Textile Administration Bureau reached 500.1 million yuan. The illegal profits obtained were very high. For example, in March 1950, the firm sold 15 dan of coal-based medium yuan to the China Textile Company: 10 million yuan per dan; while Damao bought the goods from other pigment firms at only 6 million yuan per dan. In a single transaction, the firm made a profit of 60 million yuan.
    Chen Xianfan not only abused his power for personal gain, but also colluded with Lin Tianyou (Chen's godson), the director of the Bureau's Chemical Laboratory, and Wu Tongzhao (also the director of the Zhenda Chemical Factory), a processing technologist, to engage in collective malfeasance. For example, in July 1950, Xingchang sold 30 kilograms of salt-based yellow to the First Printing and Dyeing Factory under the Bureau, priced at 80 million yuan, while the market price was only 30 million yuan. The China Chemical Factory, opened by Lin Tianyou himself, also sold low-quality pigments to the Textile Administration Bureau. The First Printing and Dyeing Factory of the Bureau received more than 5,800 kilograms of low-quality Bien Blue salt after liberation, of which 78% was bought from Damao and Xingchang.
    In order to enable private merchants to sell inferior pigments to the Textile Administration Bureau, Chen Xianfan decided to change the dye for the Shuiyue brand An'an blue cloth produced by the First Printing and Dyeing Factory to Bien Blue salt (originally Fanlamin Blue salt). As a result, the First Printing and Dyeing Factory dyed more than 130,000 pieces of An'an blue cloth from September 1949 to July 1950, of which more than 100,000 pieces were substandard. These cloths entered the market, causing great losses to the masses, and also greatly damaged the reputation of Shuiyue brand An'an blue cloth. Although An'an blue cloth has now been changed to Fanlamin Blue salt and the quality has been improved, its price is still 150,000 yuan lower per piece than blue cloth of similar quality and cost produced by other factories. The First Printing and Dyeing Factory produces 1,200 pieces of An'an blue cloth per day, and the daily loss reaches 180 million yuan.

    Yang Guoliang, a Shunting Expert
    The Yang Guoliang "Iron Ox" shunting team of the Baichengzi Station of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau gloriously maintained a record of no accidents for 1,016 days from May 5, 1948, to February 20, 1951, completing 7,522 train shunting tasks, 60,893 safe operations, and preventing 51 major and minor accidents. The reason why the Yang Guoliang shunting team achieved these brilliant results is mainly due to: strict implementation of the system, adherence to labor discipline, and research and improvement of work methods. In their shunting operations, the coupler, switchman, and locomotive crew mutually established a connection mutual inspection system and a coupler numbering system. For example: Coupler No. 1 is responsible for disconnecting the air hose and lifting the hook, Coupler No. 2 is responsible for issuing signals after inspection, and Coupler No. 3 is responsible for applying the brakes, to avoid chaos due to too many people. Before shunting operations, they must first convene a small meeting of shunting operators, couplers, and drivers to ensure that all staff understand the sequence of operations and prevent mutual evasion of responsibility. In order to ensure shunting safety, they have established a main track signal and coupler call-and-answer method with the signal station, using the main track method to gesture to the shunting operator, informing the distance and number of vehicles, and the shunting operator increases or decreases the shunting speed according to the coupler's call. Due to the promotion of Yang Guoliang's new shunting method, the Baichengzi Station achieved 136 days without accidents during the busy winter transportation in the fourth quarter of last year, winning the Jinzhou Railway Bureau's outstanding prize flag and a bonus of 13.2 million yuan (Northeast currency). In promoting the new shunting method, Yang Guoliang constantly publicized and promoted workers' learning. He often convened workers' forums to absorb experience and methods. He leads workers to learn fixed routes, train formation and other techniques every day. Due to his painstaking research, Yang Guoliang has now achieved excellent results in operation technology. The average time required for each hook in train formation is only 2 minutes and 4.8 seconds, and the average time for each hook in train dismantling is 2 minutes and 32 seconds.
    Yang Guoliang is able to unite people in joint labor and can promote democracy and mutual assistance. He often listens to everyone's opinions, helps switchmen clean points, helps drivers clean locomotives, and visits workers' homes during off-duty hours. During the busy winter transportation, trains are sometimes delayed, so he often looks for the cause and helps the locomotive deliver air to get the train out earlier and shorten the stop time.
    He is not only an expert in completing tasks, but also has brilliant achievements in training apprentices. During the three-month apprenticeship contract period, he trained four shunting operators and eighteen couplers.
    Yang Guoliang's shunting team has now challenged the Ma Hengchang team, guaranteeing the completion of national transportation tasks.

    Farmers in Xiyan Township, Fuding County, Fujian Province, Guarantee that the Mountains and Forests Will Grow Thick and Dense
    Comrade Editor:
    Xiyan Township, 6th District, Fuding County, Fujian Province, is a remote village in the mountains. The mountains and forests are very lush, but they did not fully understand the value and loveliness of the mountains and forests in the past. When hordes of wild boars came to eat crops, farmers would drive the wild boars into the mountains and forests and set fire to the trees, burning the wild boars to death. Therefore, the trees there grew very slowly and were often destroyed. Last winter, more than 500 pine trees and countless tea trees were burned on the mountains near Xiyan Township. Chen Benluan, a farmer in Gaoshan Village, set a fire and destroyed two large areas of forest in order to facilitate his charcoal burning. Wu Ada, a shepherd in Gongyang Village, casually lit a piece of woodland because he was too cold while herding sheep, which also destroyed more than 300 tea trees and more than 100 pine trees.
    In response to this situation of indiscriminate burning of mountains, the local people's government and the Xiyan Township Land Reform Work Team have particularly strengthened publicity and education on the protection of mountains and forests; and appropriately punished those who burned the mountains. Now the farmers understand the importance of protecting mountains and forests. A member of the township farmers' association said: "Now we know that mountains and forests can prevent wind, drought, and flood, and that mountains and forests are necessary for a good harvest. Therefore, we must take good care of it and ensure that the mountains and forests here grow thick and dense."

    华东纺织管理局陈贤凡利用职权营私舞弊
    人民监察委员会已依法予以处理
    华东纺织管理局计划处副处长陈贤凡，利用职权，勾结个别落后技术人员及不法私商，营私舞弊，使国家财产与国营企业的声誉受到严重损失。中央人民监察委员会已呈准政务院撤除陈贤凡及与其勾结的林天佑、乌统昭的职务，并送交司法机关依法惩办，令其赔偿国家损失。与陈贤凡等串通舞弊之私商，中央人民监察委员会亦已督促华东纺织管理局提交人民法院，依法究办并追回国家所受损失。
    陈贤凡原为伪中国纺织公司总工程师兼印染室主任。上海解放后，他仍任中国纺织公司总工程师并兼制造处加工科科长；一九五○年七月，又升兼华东纺织管理局计划处副处长，直接负责领导印染加工及颜料化验分析等工作。解放前，他就有贪污行为；解放后仍不痛改前非，继续营私舞弊。已经查明的主要贪污事实如下：
    陈贤凡及其妻秦振球设立振大化工厂，利用陈之职权，直接间接向华东纺织管理局高价销售品质低劣的颜料。如一九四九年十二月振大化学工厂卖给华东纺织管理局第一针织厂硫化元一百担，品质仅及标准货的七五成左右，作价为四千六百九十四万元。按货物成色及一般价格计算，第一针织厂损失为一千三百十四万元。振大化工厂资本不多，但由于陈利用职权，贪污舞弊，所得暴利极多；据上海市工商局检查，该厂所存印染原料连同国外订货，估价约在三十亿以上。
    陈贤凡与上海大贸、兴昌、远大、嘉兴、永业五家颜料商行有密切的私人关系，因而这五家商行就成为华东纺织管理局购买颜料的主要商行。大贸行一九四九年全年销货总额为九亿六千五百万元，其中与华东纺织管理局的交易额达五亿三千六百余万元；一九五○年一至四月销货总额为十一亿一千一百余万元，其中与华东纺织管理局的交易额达五亿零一百余万元。其所获非法利益很多，如一九五○年三月份，该行卖给中国纺织公司煤介性元十五担：每担一千万元；而大贸行向其他颜料行买进该货时，每担仅六百万元。转手之间，该行就获利六千万元。
    陈贤凡不仅自己利用职权，营私舞弊，同时还勾结该局化验室主任林天佑（陈的干儿子）及加工科技师乌统昭（又为振大化学工厂厂长）等集体营私舞弊。如一九五○年七月兴昌行卖给该局所属第一印染厂盐基性黄三十公斤，价格八千万元，而市价仅三千万元。林天佑自己开设的中国化学厂，也曾把品质低劣的颜料卖给纺织管理局。该局第一印染厂解放后收进品质低劣的比恩蓝盐五千八百余公斤，其中买自大贸及兴昌的即占百分之七十八。
    陈贤凡为了要使私商能把劣质颜料卖给纺织管理局，就决定把第一印染厂所出品的水月牌安安蓝布的染料改为比恩蓝盐（原为凡拉明蓝盐）。结果第一印染厂自一九四九年九月至一九五○年七月共染制安安蓝布十三万余匹，其中不合标准的劣品达十万余匹。这些布流入市场，使群众遭受很大损失，同时又使水月牌安安蓝布信誉大受损失。现在安安蓝布虽已改用凡拉明蓝盐，品质业已提高；但其价格却要比其他厂所出品质、成本相仿之蓝布每匹低十五万元。第一印染厂日产安安蓝布一千二百匹，每日损失即达一亿八千万元。

    调车能手杨国良
    锦州铁路局白城子车站杨国良铁牛调车组，从一九四八年五月五日起到一九五一年二月二十日止，光荣的保持一千零十六天无事故，完成七千五百二十二列车的调车任务，安全作业六万零八百九十三钩，防止了大小事故五十一件。杨国良调车组所以获得这些光辉成绩，主要是由于：严格执行制度，遵守劳动纪律，钻研并改进工作方法。他们在调车作业中，连结员，扳道员和机车乘务员互相订立连系互检制和连结员分号制。如：一号连结员负责摘风管和提钩，二号连结员负责在检查后发给号志，三号连结员上闸，避免人多起哄。在调车作业前，他们必先召集调车员、连结员和司机开小会，使全体工作人员都明确了作业次序，防止互相推诿。为了保证调车安全，他们和信号所订立要道讯号和连结员呼唤应答办法，用要道方式向调车员打手势，通告距离和车辆数量，调车员根据连结员呼唤而增减调车速度。白城子车站由于推广了杨国良的新调车法，在去年第四季度繁忙的冬季运输中，全站达到一百三十六天无事故，荣获全锦州铁路局的优胜奖旗并奖金一千三百二十万元（东北币）。在推行新调车法中，杨国良不断向大家宣传，推动工友学习。他经常召集工友座谈，吸取经验和办法。每天领导工友学习固定线路、编车等技术。由于他的苦心钻研，现在杨国良在作业技术上已经有了优异成绩，编车每钩平均只需时二分四秒八，解体车每钩平均二分三十二秒。
    杨国良在联合劳动中能团结人，并能发扬民主与互助精神。他经常听取大家意见，帮助扳道员擦岔子，帮助司机擦机车，在休班时到工友家访问。在冬季运输繁忙时，列车有时晚点，他就经常找原因，帮助机车送风，使列车早点开出，缩短停站时间。
    他不但在完成任务上是个能手，在带徒弟方面也有辉煌的成绩。在三个月师徒合同期中；培养出四名调车员，十八名连结员。
    杨国良调车组现已和马恒昌小组应战，保证完成国家运输任务。

    福建福鼎县溪岩乡农民保证让山林长得密丛丛的编辑同志：
    福建省福鼎县六区溪岩乡，是山沟里的一个偏僻乡村，山林很茂盛，但是他们过去并不完全懂得山林之可贵与可爱。当成群结队的野猪来吃田禾的时候，农民们就把野猪赶到山林里，放火烧掉林木，烧死野猪。因此，那里的林木成长很慢，时常被毁。去年冬天，溪岩乡附近的山上共烧毁了五百多株松树和无数的茶树。高山村农民陈本鸾为了便利自己烧木炭，放了一把火烧毁了两大片山林。贡洋村牧童吴阿搭因放羊太冷，随手就点着一片林木，结果也烧毁了茶树三百多株，松树一百多株。
    针对这种随意烧山的情况，当地人民政府及溪岩乡土地改革工作组特别加强了保护山林的宣传教育；并适当处罚了烧山的人。现在农民们都懂得了保护山林的重要。乡农会委员说：“现在我们才知道山林能防风、防旱、防涝，有了山林才能使庄稼丰收。因此，我们一定要看好它，保证让我们这里的山林都长得密丛丛的。”
