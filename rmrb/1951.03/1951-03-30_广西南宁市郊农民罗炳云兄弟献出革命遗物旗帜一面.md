Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th. Following the donation of a flag of the Peasants' Association from the era of the Ruijin Democratic Government by an old farmer in Long'an County, Guangxi Province, the brothers Luo Bingyun and Luo Ruiyun, farmers in Gaoling Village, suburban Nanning City in the same province, have also donated a flag of the Peasants' Association from the same period to the Nanning Municipal People's Government. This flag is also red, and in the lower right corner is a plough and harrow made of white cloth. As early as 1927, the farmers of Gaoling Village, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, organized a peasants' association. At that time, Luo Bingyun's and Luo Ruiyun's father, Luo Dexuan, was a member of the peasants' association. Later, Luo Dexuan was unfortunately poisoned by Kuomintang bandits. His wife hid the flag left by her husband in the quilt and said to her two sons: "Your father organized the peasants' association, and this flag is all that is left after his death. Seeing the flag will remind you of your father." During the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese devils invaded Gaoling Village, they tore up Luo Dexuan's portrait and beat the old grandfather to death. The house was burned down, but the Luo family, mother and two sons, always carried the quilt hiding the flag with them during their escape, unwilling to discard it. This time, the 50-year-old mother encouraged her sons to donate their father's revolutionary relics to the People's Government. The Municipal People's Government immediately rewarded them with 300 catties of rice. In order to avenge their father and defend their homes and country, the Luo brothers transferred the 300 catties of rice to the Guangxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.

　　广西南宁市郊农民罗炳云兄弟献出革命遗物旗帜一面
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】继广西省隆安县老农献出瑞金民主政府时代农民协会的旗帜后，又有该省南宁市郊区高岭村农民罗炳云、罗瑞云两兄弟，向南宁市人民政府献出同一时期农民协会的旗帜一面。该旗亦为红色，旗的右下方同样有白布制成的犁耙一个。早在一九二七年，高岭村农民即在中国共产党的领导下，组织了农民协会，当时罗氏兄弟的父亲罗德宣，就是农民协会的委员。后来罗德宣不幸被国民党匪徒毒死，他的妻子就将丈夫遗留下来的旗帜收藏在棉被里，并对他两个儿子说：“你父亲组织农民协会，死后只留有这面旗帜，看了旗帜就会想起你父亲了。”抗日战争中日本鬼子侵略到高岭村，把罗德宣的遗像撕毁了，把老祖父也打死了，房屋被烧毁，但罗家母子三人在逃难中，始终带着那条藏着旗子的被子不忍丢弃。这次，这位五十多岁的老母亲勉励儿子把父亲的革命遗物献给人民政府，该市人民政府当即奖励给他们三百斤大米。罗氏兄弟为了替父亲报仇，保家卫国，又把三百斤大米，转送给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会广西分会，以慰劳中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军。
