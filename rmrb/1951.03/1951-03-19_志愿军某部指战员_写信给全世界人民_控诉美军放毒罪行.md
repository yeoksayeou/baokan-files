　　【Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th】Commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have jointly written a letter to peace-loving people around the world, denouncing the shameless crime of the U.S. aggressor troops in flagrantly violating international law by using poison gas bombs.

　　Sun Degong, Gong Kexian, Meng Zuorong, Yang Ming, Yin Weifu, and others of the 2nd Battalion of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, in a jointly signed letter of accusation, said: "At 1300 hours on February 23, the U.S. aggressor troops dropped a choking poison gas bomb on our position in Lili. This method of poisoning by the U.S. aggressor troops is so despicable and vile that it has completely lost its humanity. The poisoning by the U.S. aggressor troops does not indicate its strength, but symbolizes the imminent arrival of its death. This shameless act of the U.S. aggressor troops will never scare us; on the contrary, it will further arouse our hatred for the U.S. aggressors."

　　Zhu Baogui, deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Artillery Battalion of a certain unit, and soldier Liu Mingyi, et al., said in a jointly signed letter of accusation: "The U.S. aggressors' dropping of poison gas bombs only makes the people of the world once again recognize their cruelty and shamelessness. We want to warn the U.S. aggressors: Your poison gas bombs still cannot save your destined failure. Because what determines victory is the powerful force of the people, not the murder weapons of your small handful of imperialist elements. We will more heroically, more firmly, and more thoroughly annihilate the U.S. aggressors."

　　Xiang Yangxuan, a soldier of the small artillery squad of the 8th Company of a certain unit, denounced the crime of the U.S. aggressor troops in releasing poison gas, saying: "At 4:30 pm on March 3, the U.S. aggressor troops released poison gas shells at our Tupingli position. When Japanese imperialism invaded China, it also used poison gas, but in the end, it still failed. Now, the U.S. imperialists, like the Japanese imperialists, are also unable to save their doomed fate. In addition to denouncing its crime of violating international law to the people of the world, we are determined to work with the Korean People's Army to completely eliminate the U.S. aggressor troops until the complete liberation of Korea. We must also capture the poison gas war criminals and severely punish them."

　　Due to the U.S. aggressor troops' flagrant use of poison gas at the front, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have paid attention to strengthening anti-gas education. Commanders and fighters have expressed with full confidence: The U.S. bandits want to poison us to death; it's simply a dream! We must resolutely defeat them and wipe them out completely!

　　志愿军某部指战员
    写信给全世界人民
    控诉美军放毒罪行
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】中国人民志愿军某部指挥员战斗员，联名写信给全世界爱好和平的人民，控诉美国侵略军悍然违反国际公法使用毒气弹的无耻罪行。
    志愿军某部第二营孙德功、龚克先、孟昨荣、杨明、尹维傅等在联合署名的控诉信中说：“美国侵略军于二月二十三日十三时在我栗里阵地投下窒息性毒气炸弹一枚。美国侵略军这种放毒的手段是多么卑鄙和下流，它已经完全失掉人性。美国侵略军的放毒，并不表示它的强大，却是象征着它的死亡的即将到来。美国侵略军这种无耻的行动，决不能吓倒我们，相反的，更激起我们对美国侵略者的仇恨。”
    某部炮兵第三营副营长朱宝贵和战士刘明义等在联合署名的控诉信中说：“美国侵略者投掷毒气弹，只有使全世界人民再一次认识了它的残忍和无耻。我们要警告美国侵略者：你们的毒气弹仍然是不能挽救你们失败的定局的。因为决定胜利的是强大的人民力量，而不是你们一小撮帝国主义分子的杀人武器。我们将更英勇、更坚定、更彻底地歼灭美国侵略者。”
    某部第八连小炮班的战士向阳轩等控诉美国侵略军施放毒气的罪行说：“三月三日下午四时半，美国侵略军向我们土坪里阵地施放毒气炮弹。日本帝国主义侵略中国时也曾经使用过毒气，但最后它还是失败了。现在美帝国主义者像日本帝国主义者一样，也是挽救不了它的失败的命运的。我们除了向世界人民控诉它的违反国际公法的罪行而外，下定决心，和朝鲜人民军一道，彻底消灭美国侵略军队，直到完全解放朝鲜。我们还一定要把放毒战犯捉拿回来，严厉惩办。”
    由于美国侵略军在前线悍然使用毒气，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军已注意加强防毒教育。指挥员和战斗员们信心百倍地表示：美国强盗想毒死我们，简直是梦想！我们要坚决地战胜他们，把他们消灭干净！
