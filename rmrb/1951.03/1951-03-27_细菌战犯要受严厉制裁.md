　　Bacterial Warfare Criminals Must Be Severely Punished
　　According to a New China News Agency report on the 21st of this month, the United States has been massively manufacturing bacterial weapons in Japan, attempting to use this inhumane method to poison the Korean people and military in order to salvage the American military's defeat. This inhuman and criminal plot by the American aggressors not only seriously violates international law, but is also a major crime of deliberately destroying human civilization, and therefore, it must be subject to the common sanction and severe punishment of all mankind.
　　The various barbaric and brutal crimes committed by the American army on the Korean battlefield have repeatedly exposed it as the most ferocious enemy of human civilization. Its indiscriminate bombing and shooting of peaceful Korean towns, and its crazy massacre of peaceful Korean people, have long aroused universal anger and condemnation from peace-loving people around the world. Recently, after the invading American forces suffered continuous and severe setbacks, their barbaric behavior has become even more intensified, and they even used machine guns to collectively massacre captured personnel of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and repeatedly used poison gas bombs and shells four times on the Han River front, attempting to poison our People's fighters who are fighting for peace. Now, the United States is massively manufacturing bacterial weapons in Japan as a means of desperate struggle. This will only make the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people around the world even more angry, and intensify efforts to resolutely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate the American aggressors.
　　It must be pointed out that the United States' deliberate conspiracy to manufacture bacterial weapons to harm mankind began shortly after the end of World War II. The United States not only shielded Japanese bacterial warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii, who researched and manufactured bacterial weapons during World War II, but also used the results of Japanese research on bacterial weapons to establish a base for manufacturing bacterial weapons at Dettrick Camp near Washington, USA. According to the confession of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson, the U.S. military's chemical department spends more than 12 million U.S. dollars each year on this criminal work. These are all ironclad evidence that the United States deliberately uses bacterial weapons against peace-loving people around the world.
　　We want to solemnly announce to the world that the American and Japanese bacterial warfare criminals who have been utilized to manufacture bacterial weapons for the United States must be brought to justice without exception. The heinous crimes they have committed against humanity must be subject to just sanctions.

　　细菌战犯要受严厉制裁
    据新华社本月二十一日的报道，美国已在日本大规模地从事细菌武器的制造，企图用此灭绝人性的手段，毒害朝鲜军民，以挽救美军的失败。美国侵略者这种惨无人道的罪恶图谋，不但严重地违反了国际公法，而且是蓄意毁灭人类文明的重大罪行，因此，它必定要受到全体人类的共同制裁与严厉的惩罚。
    美国军队在朝鲜战场上所犯下的种种野蛮残暴罪行，一再暴露了它是人类文明的最凶残的敌人。它对朝鲜和平城镇的滥施炸射，和对朝鲜和平人民的疯狂屠杀，早已激起了世界爱好和平人民的普遍愤怒与指责。最近，侵朝美军在连续遭受到严重的挫败后，其残暴行为更变本加厉，竟曾以机枪集体残杀我人民志愿军被俘人员，并在汉江前线连续四次使用毒气炸弹与炮弹，妄图毒害为和平而战的我人民战士。现在，美国更在日本大规模地制造细菌武器，以作为绝望挣扎的手段。这只有使中朝人民与世界爱好和平人民更加愤怒，并为坚决、干净、彻底地消灭美国侵略者而加紧努力。
    必须指出，美国蓄意制造细菌武器以残害人类的罪恶阴谋，早在第二次世界大战结束后不久即已开始。美国不但包庇了第二次世界大战期间研究并制造细菌武器的日本细菌战犯石井四郎之流，并利用了日本研究细菌武器的结果，在美国华盛顿附近的迪特瑞克营（Dettrick）设立了制造细菌武器的基地。据前任美国国防部长詹森的供认，美国军队化学部门，每年在这个罪恶工作上花费达一千二百万美元以上。这都是美国蓄意对世界爱好和平人民使用细菌武器的铁证。
    我们要向全世界郑重宣布，对于美国的以及被利用为美国制造细菌武器的日本细菌战犯们，必须一律究办，他们对人类所犯下的滔天罪行，一定要受到正义的制裁的。
