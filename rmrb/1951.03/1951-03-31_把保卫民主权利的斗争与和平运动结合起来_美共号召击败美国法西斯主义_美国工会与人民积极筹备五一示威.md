　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 29th: A statement issued by the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States emphasizes that the broad and active struggle to maintain the legal status of the Communist Party of the United States must be regarded as an integral part of the struggle for peace and the defeat of American fascism.
    The statement reaffirms the Communist Party's loyalty to the interests of the American people and the cause of peace and democracy, and points out that millions of Americans are beginning to realize that those who are trying to continue and expand the Korean War and launch an international war will first attack the Communist Party. In order to launch an international war, they are attempting to deprive all American people of their freedom rights, further lower the people's living standards, and stifle the black people's movement for liberation and equality. The statement points out that the struggle against the reactionary Smith Act and McCarran Act is the cause of all Americans who are willing to defend peace and the Bill of Rights, especially organized workers and black people. This struggle must unite people with various political opinions.
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 29th: The Joint Committee of American Labor Unions and People to Celebrate May Day recently held a meeting in New York, attended by more than 500 representatives from various labor unions and local peace groups. The meeting formulated a plan to hold a May Day demonstration in New York under the slogan of fighting for peace.
    The meeting elected an executive body composed of 25 people to prepare for the May Day demonstration.
