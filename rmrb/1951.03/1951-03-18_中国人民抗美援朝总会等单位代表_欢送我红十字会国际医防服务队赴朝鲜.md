Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The 204 members of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team left Beijing for Korea on the 17th. The Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters initiated a send-off at the station. Those present included Chen Shutong, Li Dequan, Peng Zemin, Chen Qiyuan, Wu Yunfu, Cao Mengjun, Wu Maosun, Lin Shixiao, Kim Kuk-bo, Counselor of the Korean Embassy, representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, and members of the International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team, totaling over 400 people.

First, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters, delivered a farewell speech, saying, "The formation of this team by Chinese medical workers once again demonstrates the determination of our Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea. As long as the American aggressors are not completely defeated, people from all walks of life across the country will contribute our strength from all aspects with greater determination and broader organization to fight for defending the motherland and defending world peace."

Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, congratulated them on going to the forefront of defending world peace and urged the team members to pay attention to their health in order to complete this glorious task.

Kim Kuk-bo, Counselor of the Korean Embassy in China, expressed his gratitude for the large group of medical workers going to Korea, saying, "Killing and arson are the true colors of American imperialism, while acting bravely for a just cause is the noble morality of our people's country. The International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team's arrival in Korea, healing one person, is equivalent to creating one more shell, adding one more point of strength to the anti-aggression war." The Korean Embassy and the China People's Relief Administration and other units presented flowers to the team.

Zhou Lixin, the captain of the First Detachment of the International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team, said on behalf of all the team members, "We have been warmly seen off repeatedly by people from all walks of life, and we have realized the expectations of the people across the country for us and the arduousness of our task. I guarantee to resolutely complete the task to repay the love of the people across the country."

    欢送我红十字会国际医防服务队赴朝鲜
    【新华社十七日讯】中国红十字会国际医防服务队队员二百零四人在十七日离北京往朝鲜，中国人民抗美援朝总会发起在车站送行。到陈叔通、李德全、彭泽民、陈其瑗、伍云甫、曹孟君、吴茂荪、林士笑、朝鲜大使馆金国辅参赞，各民主党派，各人民团体代表及国际医防服务队队员等四百余人。
    首由中国人民抗美援朝总会陈叔通副主席致欢送词，他说：“中国的医务工作者组成了这一支队伍，又一次表明了我们中国人民抗美援朝的决心。只要美国侵略军有一天不被彻底击溃，我们全国各地各阶层人民就要以更大的决心，更广泛的组织，从各方面贡献出我们的力量，为保卫祖国保卫世界和平而斗争。”
    中国红十字会总会李德全会长祝贺他们走上保卫世界和平的最前哨去，并且要队员们为了完成这一光荣任务而注意自己的健康。
