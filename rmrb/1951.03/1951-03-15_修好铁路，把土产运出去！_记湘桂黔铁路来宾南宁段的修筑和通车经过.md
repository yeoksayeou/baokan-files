　　Repair the railway and transport local products!
    —Record of the construction and opening of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway's Laibin-Nanning section

    This was a railway that the Kuomintang reactionary government had intermittently spent thirteen years failing to build. By the time of Guangxi's liberation, only a bare and incomplete roadbed remained along the route. The difficult engineering work of opening mountains, filling river gullies, and building bridges had not even begun. Therefore, before liberation, the people along the railway line never dreamed that they would one day be able to travel on this route by train. The farmers of Nanning, Liuzhou, and other special districts in Guangxi province also never imagined that the millions of dan of yellow sugar and local products such as star anise, cassia bark, soybeans, tung oil, cassia oil, and fennel oil on which their livelihoods depended could be sold throughout the country via the railway, in exchange for cloth, salt, and other urban industrial products.

  I. 100,000 liberated farmers build the road
    When the news of the road construction reached Changtang Township, a sugar-producing area along the railway line, in October of last year, the farmers excitedly spread the word: "The People's Government is coming to build the road!" "In the future, transportation will be convenient, and our township will no longer have to exchange a dan of sugar for a dan of grain." In this way, 100,000 liberated farmers along the route enthusiastically and excitedly signed up to help the railway workers and Railway Engineering Corps soldiers build the road.

    During the road construction, the civilian laborers engaged in current affairs study, further realizing that opening this section of the railway to facilitate the sale of Guangxi's local products would also increase the nation's strength in resisting America and aiding Korea. Therefore, their enthusiasm for building the road soared even higher. The civilian laborers of Guixian County, which produces 300,000 dan of yellow sugar annually, were originally scheduled to complete 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork, but they exceeded that by 90,000 cubic meters.

    The Changtanggou gully-filling project, undertaken by civilian laborers from Yongchun County, was estimated by engineers to require 400 civilian laborers working for 80 days to complete. However, the liberated farmers of Yongchun County, fearing delays to the track-laying schedule, dispatched a massive shock brigade of 1,600 people, proposing the slogan "Complete the task in 40 days to avoid delaying track laying." The project was arduous. The 1,600 people were crammed into the narrow and deep gully, which could only accommodate 400 workers. The bottom of the gully was loose and soft, and feet would sink when stepped on, with mud and dirty water splashing onto bodies and faces. Everyone simply took off their clothes and worked, shouting: "Dig out all the rotten mud, thoroughly eliminate American imperialism!" As a result, they filled the gully in fourteen days.

  II. Track-laying Grand Competition
    In order to develop Guangxi's economy, the Railway Engineering Corps soldiers, railway track-laying teams, and civilian laborers signed a patriotic track-laying competition agreement: "Guarantee to lay five kilometers every day; rather have people waiting for materials than materials waiting for people; guarantee quality; do not waste materials; civilian laborers carrying sleepers guarantee no delays to track-laying," and so on, totaling several articles.

    Initially, the track-laying team averaged only two and a half kilometers per day, while the Railway Engineering Corps soldiers laid three and two-tenths kilometers. The track-laying team, seeing the soldiers' great enthusiasm, caught up with three and a half kilometers, and the soldiers pushed on to four and fifteen-hundredths kilometers. By February 9th, the track-laying team had laid five and forty-six-hundredths kilometers, including switches and sidings. Upon hearing this news, the Railway Engineering Corps soldiers immediately became excited, from discussions in the squads to the companies, and everyone resolved to catch up with this figure.

    On the morning of the 11th, the Railway Engineering Corps soldiers got up at 4:30 a.m. By the time they arrived at the construction site, the civilian laborers had already laid out the ties. The soldiers pulling the steel rails were so excited that they unbuttoned their cotton coats, placed the steel rails on the pulleys, and finished pulling twenty steel rails in ten minutes, laying 600 meters in one point. Seeing the railway rapidly extending forward, the civilian laborers even more enthusiastically carried the sleepers forward to lay them, with the most productive person carrying up to sixty sleepers in one day, still laying them up to standard. The soldiers pulling the steel rails, seeing the civilian laborers carrying the sleepers and working so hard, also laid the steel rails with even greater effort. They concentrated on being careful not to hit the ties with their hammers, ensuring that the spikes were driven straight and the ties were not damaged. Soldier Zhang Lianqi developed malaria while working, and his body trembled uncontrollably, but everyone insisted that he go back to rest. However, he secretly crawled under the slope to rest for a while and then surreptitiously continued working.

    Calculating the day's results: five and four hundred and sixty-thousandths kilometers were laid on the straight track alone, with the only shortcoming being that in some places the hammers had landed on the ties. The track-laying team workers, seeing the soldiers and civilian laborers achieve such results, were both anxious and happy, and they hastily posted red-paper slogans on the empty train cars after the civilian laborers finished carrying the sleepers: "Learn from the patriotic soldiers and civilian laborer brothers!" The soldiers also cheerfully wrote the slogan "Learn technology from the First Track-Laying Team and improve quality" and posted it on the workers' dormitory cars.

    "The train is running!" On February 23rd, the tracks reached Nanning City, the capital of Guangxi Province. On March 5th, Nanning Railway Station temporarily sold passenger and freight tickets. On this very day, a train fully loaded with Guangxi's local products departed from Nanning for the first time. The masses along the route cheered.

    Guangxi Province possesses abundant local products. However, in the past, due to inconvenient transportation, local products could not be exported, and the needed grain and industrial products could not be obtained, so the lives of the people of Guangxi Province were very impoverished. For example, Changtang Township is a famous sugar-producing area in Guangxi Province, but it lacks rice, salt, and cloth, and most farmers and small merchants eat thin porridge all year round. There is a folk song in Guangxi: "Guangxi is bitter, Guangxi is poor, no money to buy cloth and cotton, one dan of yellow sugar for one dan of grain, ten jin of grain for two jin of salt." This phenomenon will gradually change after the railway opens to traffic.

    The opening of the Laibin-Nanning section of the railway has already brought a new atmosphere to Nanning City, the distribution center for Guangxi's sugar, oil, soybeans, and other local products, as well as imported industrial goods: construction workers are busy. Many hotels and warehouses are being built. A tricycle company is being organized. Meng Daren, director of the Nanning Local Products Marketing Association, told reporters: Nanning's merchants engaged in the local products industry are actively planning to switch to joint operations, joint transportation, joint sales, and expanded business to welcome the opening of the railway. The reporter recalled the scene of farmers in many villages along the route setting off firecrackers, dancing the "lion," or beating gongs and drums to welcome the train passing through their villages during the road construction: they shouted: "The 'fire dragon' is here!" This was the first time the local farmers had seen a train in their own country. Their dreams during the Kuomintang reactionary rule have finally been realized under the people's own government.

　　修好铁路，把土产运出去！
    ——记湘桂黔铁路来宾南宁段的修筑和通车经过
    新华社记者  洪流
    这是一段国民党反动政府断断续续历时十三年没有修建成的铁路，到广西解放时，沿线只有一段光秃秃残缺不全的路基。路上开大山、填河沟、建桥梁等艰巨的工程，动也没有动。所以在解放前，铁路沿线的人民谁也没有梦想自己会有一天乘上火车在这条路上来往。广西省南宁、柳州等专区的农民也没有想到他们生活所赖的生产百万担的黄糖和八角、桂皮、黄豆、桐油、桂油、茴油等土产能经由铁路畅销全国，换回布、盐和其他城市工业品。
  一、十万翻身农民筑路
    当去年十月间，修路消息传到铁路沿线产糖区的长塘乡时，农民兴奋地互相传说着：“人民政府来修路了！”“将来交通方便了，我们乡里再不会一担糖换一担粮了。”沿线十万翻身农民就这样热情鼓舞地争着报名来帮助铁路工人和铁道兵团战士修路。
    在修路中，民工们进行了时事学习，进一步认识了修通这段铁路使广西的土产畅销，也就是增加了全国抗美援朝的力量。所以他们修路的情绪更加高涨。年产三十万担黄糖的贵县民工原定修二十五万土方，结果超过了九万土方。
    由永淳县民工担任的长塘沟填沟工程，根据工程师测量计算，需要四百民工用八十天时间才能作好。但是永淳县翻身农民因为怕耽误铺轨的时间，就浩浩荡荡地开来了一支一千六百人的突击队，提出“不误铺轨，四十天完成”的口号。工程是艰巨的。一千六百人挤在狭而深的只能容四百人工作的沟里。沟底松而软，脚一踩就陷下去，烂泥和脏水都溅到身上和脸上。大家索性把衣服脱了干，喊着：“挖尽烂泥呀，彻底消灭美帝国主义！”结果，他们十四天就把沟填起来了。
  二、铺轨大竞赛
    为了发展广西经济，铁道兵团战士、铁路钉道队、民工之间订立了爱国主义的铺轨竞赛公约：“保证每天钉五公里，宁可人等料，料不等人；保证质量；不浪费材料；民工扛枕木保证不耽误铺轨”等，一共好几条。
    开始，钉道队每天平均只钉两公里五，铁道兵团战士却钉了三公里二。钉道队一看战士们劲头大，追上了个三公里五，战士又一股劲钉到四公里一五。到二月九日，钉道队连岔子、股道钉了五公里四六。铁道兵团战士听说这个消息，马上兴奋得从班里讨论到连里，大伙决心赶上这个数字。
    十一日早晨，铁道兵团战士四点半就起床。他们刚到工地，民工早已把道木摆好了。拉钢轨的战士兴奋得解开棉衣，把钢轨搁在滑车上，十分钟就拉完二十根钢轨，一点钟就铺开六百公尺。民工眼看着铁路迅速地在向前伸展，更是一股劲地扛着枕木往前铺，最多的一个人一天扛到六十颗枕木，还铺得合乎标准。拉钢轨的战士一看扛枕木的民工这样加油干，也就更加劲地铺钢轨。他们聚精会神地注意不让锤子打在枕木上，使道钉打得正，枕木又不受损伤。战士张连岐在干活时发起疟疾来，身子直哆嗦，大家硬要他回去休息，他却爬在路坡下休息了一会又偷偷地干起来。
    计算这一天的成绩：光直线就钉了五公里四百六十公尺，只是在某些地方还有锤子落在枕木上的缺点。钉道队工友看了战士、民工有这样成绩又急又喜欢，忙在民工们扛完枕木的空车皮上贴上红纸写的标语：“向爱国的战士和民工弟兄学习！”战士们也笑嘻嘻地写了“向第一钉道队学习技术，提高质量。”的标语贴在工友们的宿车上。
    “火车通了！”二月二十三日铁轨铺到了广西省会南宁市。三月五日，南宁车站临时出售客货车票。就在这一天，满载广西土产的火车首次由南宁开出。沿途万众欢腾。
    广西省拥有丰富的土产。但是过去因为交通不便，土产品不能输出，需要的粮食和工业品换不到手，所以广西省人民的生活非常穷困。比如，长塘乡是广西省有名的产糖区，但却缺少米、盐、布匹，农民和小商人大都是终年吃稀饭。广西有一句民谣：“广西苦，广西穷，没有银钱买布棉，一担黄糖一担粮，十斤粮食两斤盐。”这种现象在铁路通车以后就会逐渐改变了。
    来宾、南宁段铁路的通车，已经给广西省糖、油、黄豆等土产与外来工业品集散地的南宁市带来了一片新气象：建筑工人忙起来了。许多旅馆和货栈正在大兴土木。一家三轮车公司正在筹组。南宁市土产运销同业公会主任蒙大任对记者说：南宁市经营土产业的商人，正在纷纷计划改用联营、联运、联销和扩大营业来迎接铁路的通车。记者回忆起在筑路的列车经过沿线村庄时，不少村庄的农民放起鞭炮舞着“狮子”或者敲着锣鼓来欢迎的情形来了：他们高喊着：“‘火龙’来了！”这是当地农民们第一次看见了自己祖国的火车。他们在国民党反动派统治时期的梦想，终于在人民自己的政权下面实现了。
