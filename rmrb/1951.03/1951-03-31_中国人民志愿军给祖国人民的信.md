　　Letter from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the People of the Motherland
   (I) Dear People of the Motherland:
　　We received letters of comfort and慰劳品 from the motherland on the icy and snowy battlefield; and we know that the workers and farmers in the motherland are launching a warm patriotic production competition in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. Your support for us has inspired our fighting spirit. We know that the Chinese and Korean people, and even the people of the world, have great expectations of us. This is our supreme glory; we must defeat the US imperialist aggressor troops and defend the security of the motherland and world peace.
　　Dear People of the Motherland: After we came to Korea, we received enthusiastic care from the Korean people. Every time we passed through a village, the roadsides were full of men, women, old and young welcoming us and慰劳品 us. When we stayed in a village, the landlady always helped us make breakfast as soon as it dawned; and often helped us sew and wash clothes. When we left, they led the way for us and sent us off warmly. This made us deeply feel the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.
　　Dear People of the Motherland: In the snow-covered valleys of Korea, we often see groups of men, women, old and young wearing single clothes warming themselves by the fire. Their homes and everything else have been bombed by the US aggressor troops, and now they have nowhere to go. In the enemy tanks we seized on the front line, we often found the bodies of Korean women who had been ravaged and killed. We saw Korean children crying around the bodies of their mothers lying in the snow; and the youngest infants were still dryly sucking the milk of their mothers who had been raped by beasts and then killed. We have heard countless Korean people accusing the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang of inhumanly massacring, burying alive, throwing into the sea, tying up in the snow to freeze to death, crushing with tanks, gouging out eyes and disemboweling their relatives and compatriots... Dear People of the Motherland: Who has no parents, who has no children! After hearing their accusations, we couldn't help but recall the atrocities of the Japanese invaders when they invaded our country. All our comrades resolutely stated: "We must avenge the Korean people! We must defend the security of the motherland!"
　　The unyielding Korean people are fighting back against the enemy's aggression. They actively support the front line and help us fight. The bridges on the roads and railways were bombed by enemy planes, and the Korean workers repaired them that night, allowing us to pass as usual. In some mountain roads, our cars were difficult to drive; the Korean people helped us transport them. During the battle, they risked gunfire to help us deliver grain and carry the wounded. The Korean People's Army fought side by side with us, as close as brothers. Sometimes everyone camped in a village, and they always gave us the widest house to live in; which made us very touched.
　　Dear People of the Motherland: We have full confidence and assurance to wipe out the US aggressor troops on the Korean battlefield. We will use this to answer your love for us.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　All members of the Infantry and Artillery Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
   (II) Compatriots of the Motherland:
　　Recently, we received many letters of comfort from you, and all our comrades felt extremely happy and grateful, and determined to repay the people of the motherland for their love for us by thoroughly defeating the US aggressor troops.
　　When we were fighting the enemy at Hagaru-ri, many comrades were hungry and held their ground to fight the enemy. Our artillerymen, on the night of the battle, because the task was urgent, Comrade Li Zijian used his fingers instead of a lanyard to fire the gun. It is very dangerous to fire a gun with your fingers, and you can easily get hurt if you are not careful. But in order to strike the enemy, Comrade Li Zijian, not caring that his hands were covered in blood, continued to happily fire the gun.
　　There are many similar heroic deeds. Because every volunteer soldier clearly knows our glorious and great mission, as well as the expectations of all the Chinese and the people of the world for us.
　　We hope that you will carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country more universally and deeply in the country. Let all the Chinese people work together for the sacred cause of defending the security of the motherland and defending world peace.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　All soldiers of the 8th squad of the 3rd platoon of the Infantry and Artillery Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

### 中国人民志愿军给祖国人民的信

　　中国人民志愿军给祖国人民的信
   （一）亲爱的祖国人民：
    我们在冰天雪地的战场上，收到了来自祖国的慰问信和慰劳品；并且知道祖国的工人和农民弟兄们在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，展开了热烈的爱国生产竞赛。你们对我们的支援，鼓舞了我们的斗志。我们知道：中朝人民以至全世界人民，都对我们有着极大的期望。这是我们无上的光荣；我们一定要打败美帝国主义侵略军队，保卫祖国安全和世界和平。
    亲爱的祖国人民：我们来到朝鲜后，受到朝鲜人民热情地爱护。我们每经过一个村庄，路旁都站满了老少男女来欢迎我们、慰劳我们。当我们在一个村庄住宿时，总是天刚一亮，房东大娘就帮我们做好了早饭；并且经常帮我们缝洗衣服。当我们离开时，他们替我们带路，热情地送我们。这使我们深深感到中朝人民的伟大友谊。
    亲爱的祖国人民：我们在朝鲜积满冰雪的山谷里，经常看到穿着单衣的成群的男女老少在烤火取暖。他们的家和一切东西都被美国侵略军炸毁了，现在已经无家可归。我们在前线缴来的敌军坦克中，还常常发现有被蹂躏后而被杀害的朝鲜妇女的尸体。我们看到朝鲜儿童们围着躺在雪地上的母亲的尸体哭泣；而最小的婴孩还在干吮着被野兽奸淫后又被杀的母亲的奶。我们听过无数朝鲜人民控诉他们的亲人和同胞怎样被美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮绝灭人性地集体枪杀、活埋、抛在海里、捆绑在雪地里冻死、用坦克碾死、挖眼剖腹……。亲爱的祖国人民：谁无父母，谁无子女！我们听了他们的控诉，不禁回忆起日寇侵略我国时的暴行来。我们全体同志都坚决表示：“一定要为朝鲜人民报仇！一定要保卫祖国的安全！”
    不屈的朝鲜人民用战斗来回击敌人的侵略。他们积极地支援前线，帮助我们作战。公路、铁路上的桥梁被敌机炸毁了，朝鲜工友们当晚就把它抢修好，让我们照旧通行。在有些山道里，我们的汽车难以开行；朝鲜人民就帮我们运输。在战斗时，他们冒着枪林弹雨帮我们送粮、抬伤员。朝鲜人民军和我们并肩作战，亲切得像兄弟一样。有时大家在一个村子宿营，他们总是把最宽大的房子让给我们住；这使我们很感动。
    亲爱的祖国人民：我们有万分的信心和把握把美国侵略军歼灭在朝鲜的战场上。我们就以此来回答你们对我们的热爱。
                        中国人民志愿军某部步炮连全体
    （二）祖国的同胞们：
    最近，我们接到你们寄来的很多慰问信，我们全体同志都感到无比高兴和感激，并且决心以彻底打垮美国侵略军队来报答祖国人民对我们的热爱。
    当我们在下碣?里和敌人作战时，很多同志是饿着肚子，坚守阵地打击敌人。我们炮兵在作战那天晚上，因为任务紧急，李子见同志就用手指代替拉火索发炮。用手指发炮是很危险的，一不小心就会受伤。但李子见同志为了打击敌人，弄得满手是血，仍然毫不在意，继续愉快地发炮。
    类似的英勇事迹是很多的。因为我们每一个志愿军战士都清楚地知道我们光荣伟大的任务，以及全中国、全世界人民对我们的期望。
    希望你们在国内更普及、更深入地展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动。让全中国人民共同为保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平的神圣事业而奋斗。
