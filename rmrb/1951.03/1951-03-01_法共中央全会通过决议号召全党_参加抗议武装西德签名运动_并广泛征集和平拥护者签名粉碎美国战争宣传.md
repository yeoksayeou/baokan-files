Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18th (TASS dispatch): The plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party concluded its work on February 15th. At the second meeting, the plenary session continued to discuss Duclos's report. Those who spoke during the discussion included Guy Ducolon, Léon Feix, Laurent Casanova, Jean Bardolini, and others. Duclos gave a concluding speech.

　　*L'Humanité* published the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. The resolution emphasized: American imperialism and its lackeys are placed in a desperate situation by the continuous victories of the democratic camp and the heavy contradictions of their own system. They are increasingly relying on a policy of open aggression and are frantically stepping up preparations for a third world war in all aspects. The resolution stated: The revival of German militarism and the US opposition to the unification of Germany on a democratic basis are intended to turn Germany into a second Korea tomorrow to expand the war. The capitalists—the exploiters of all countries—regard American imperialism as the gendarme maintaining their privileges throughout the world. It is precisely for this reason that the rulers of France, especially the leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party, completely obey American imperialism and accept its aggressive plans. They support the rearmament of Germany and allow some French ports and cities to be occupied by the United States in order to supply the new German defense forces with necessary materials through our country. They have already extended the term of military service to eighteen months, and now they want to extend it to two years, in order to provide their masters with the infantry they need to reinforce the expeditionary forces in Vietnam with young soldiers. They are turning the French economy, which is subordinate to the American economy, onto the path of war. They are continuously increasing military spending without limit. The resolution then pointed out the devastating consequences of war preparations for the French people. Due to the stockpiling of strategic raw materials, the continuous issuance of banknotes to make up for deficits, and the increase in taxes, prices have soared, and the purchasing power of already meager wages, salaries, allowances, and subsidies has been reduced again. In France, all freedoms—freedom of belief, procession, association, publication, scientific research, etc.—have been completely trampled upon. Supporters of peace are either thrown into prison or persecuted, while traitors go unpunished. A vile police regime prevails throughout the country. The government is undermining various laws. Now, the American party is playing election tricks in order to exploit the increasing parliamentary representation of the Communist Party. The resolution further stated: War is by no means inevitable. The forces defending peace are immeasurably stronger than the forces of aggression. The forces of peace are capable of defeating the forces of aggression. The great Soviet Union leads the peace camp in battle. It is fighting for the prohibition of weapons that bring about large-scale destruction, for universal disarmament under supervision, and for the signing of peace pacts between major powers. In addition, the Soviet Union tirelessly and repeatedly proposes holding a four-power conference to resolve the German issue and implement the Potsdam Agreement on the disarmament of Germany. In the peace camp, there are also the people's democratic countries, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of China, the international workers' movement, and the great movement of the people of colonial and dependent countries for national liberation. For the first time in history, a broad movement of peace supporters including various ideas and beliefs has unfolded all over the world. The results of collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal have successfully stopped the evil clutches of the atomic strategists. Thanks to this movement, the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw was able to formulate general conditions for ensuring lasting peace. In its war plans, American imperialism has assigned France an important role as a strategic base and reserve of cannon fodder. Thus, in the overall struggle for peace, the main responsibility falls on our people and our party. Undeniably, the struggle against the arming of West Germany is the fundamental issue of this overall struggle. Crushing the rearmament of German militarists—revanchists—means making war impossible in Europe, which means preventing a third world war. The resolution emphasized: At present, for Communist Party members, there is no more important or urgent task than actively participating in the signature campaign against the rearmament of West Germany, which is being carried out under the initiative of the National Peace Committee. This major movement is deeply welcomed by the vast majority of the French people. In order for this movement to be fully effective, it must exceed the remarkable results of the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to act more quickly. This greatly depends on the assistance of all Communist Party members. The Central Committee called on French Communist Party members to conduct a wide-ranging explanatory movement, refuting the lies spread by the American propaganda organs about the German issue: attracting hundreds of thousands of peace supporters to participate in the signature campaign against the rearmament of West Germany, making the national petition known to every household; actively, persistently and unwaveringly participating in the peace movement to expand the movement; attracting all residents to participate in this movement, while strengthening the organization of this movement. The Central Committee reminded the whole party of the fact that the struggle against the arming of West Germany must not be separated from the struggle against excessive French armament. The resolution stated: To carry out a policy of alliance with all freedom-loving French people, the Communist Party must work harder to win the unity of action of the working class—the basic force for independence and peace, the pillar of the future France. In the complex international situation (which is characterized by the balance of power continuously becoming more favorable to the peace camp), the broad masses of the French people can and should, with their effective unity, defeat the government and its policies of enslavement and war, which are dictated by American imperialism. The victory of the French peace struggle is currently a sufficient condition to completely change the course of French policy. The victory of the peace struggle—this inevitably means the breaking of the chains of the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Treaty, meaning the defeat of fascist supporters, meaning reaching the broad road to a democratic unified government (which, with the support of the people, will implement policies of social progress and freedom, national independence and peace). This is the prospect displayed before the French people, and whether this prospect can be achieved will depend on their efforts, and first of all on the persistent and vigorous efforts of all party members who lead the masses.

　　法共中央全会通过决议号召全党
    参加抗议武装西德签名运动
    并广泛征集和平拥护者签名粉碎美国战争宣传
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日电：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议于二月十五日结束了它的工作。全体会议在第二次会议上继续讨论了杜克洛的报告。讨论中发言的有吉·杜科隆、列昂·费克、劳伦·卡桑诺伐、让·巴多利尼及其他等人。由杜洛克作总结发言。
    《人道报》发表了法国共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议。决议强调指出：美帝国主义及其奴仆们被民主阵营的不断胜利及它们本身制度的重重矛盾置于绝望境地，它们越来越依恃公开侵略的政策，并在一切方面疯狂地加紧发动第三次世界大战的准备工作。决议称：复活德国的军国主义及美国反对在民主基础上统一德国的举动，是为了明天把德国变做第二个朝鲜以扩大战争。资本家们——一切国家的剥削者认为美帝国主义是维护他们在全世界的特权的宪兵。正是因为这个缘故，法国的统治者，特别是右翼社会党的领袖们便完全服从美帝国主义及接受其侵略计划。他们支持重新武装德国，并让出法国的若干港口与城市供美国占领，以便通过我国供给新的德国国防军以必需的物资。他们已经把兵役期限延长到十八个月，现在又想把它延长到两年，以便为他们的主子提供所需的步兵，以便以年青的士兵增援在越南的远征军。他们使从属于美国经济的法国经济转上战争的轨道。他们无限制地不断增加军费。决议继而指出备战给法国人民造成的毁灭性的后果。由于储备战略原料、不断发行纸币以弥补赤字、增加捐税等造成物价猛涨，已经微弱的工资薪金、津贴与扶助金的购买力便再度降低了。在法国，一切自由——信仰、游行、结社、出版、科学研究等自由，都破蹂躏无遗。拥护和平的人不是被投入监牢，就是遭受迫害，而卖国贼们反而逍遥法外。卑劣的警察统治盛行于全国。政府破坏着各种法律。现在，美国党正在玩弄选举的把戏，以便剥削影响日增的共产党的议会代表权。决议进一步称：战争决不是不可避免的。保卫和平的力量比侵略力量强大得不可量度。和平力量是能够战胜侵略力量的。伟大的苏联领导和平阵营战斗着。它为禁止带来大规模毁灭的武器、为争取受监督的普遍裁军、为争取大国之间签订和平公约而奋斗着。除此以外，苏联还不倦地屡次提议召开四国代表会议，以便解决德国问题并履行关于解除德国武装的波茨坦协定。在和平阵营里，进行着斗争的还有各人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国、中华人民共和国、国际工人运动、殖民地与附属国人民争取民族解放的伟大运动。有史以来第一次全世界各地都展开了包括各种思想与信仰的和平拥护者的广泛运动。为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的成果已经成功地制止了罪恶的原子战略家的魔掌。由于这个运动，华沙第二届世界和平大会便能制定了保证持久和平的一般条件。美帝国主义者在其战争计划中分给法国一个作为战略基地与炮灰后备队的重要脚色。这样，在争取和平的总的斗争中，主要的责任便落在我们人民与我党的肩上了。无可争辩地，反对武装西德的斗争是这个总的斗争的基本问题。粉碎德国军国主义者——复仇主义者的重新武装，就意味着使欧洲不可能发生战争，就意味着防止了第三次世界大战。决议着重指出：目前对于共产党党员来说，再没有比积极参加抗议重新武装西德的签名运动更为重要、更为紧迫的任务了，这运动是在全国和平委员会的发起下进行的。这一重大的运动深受法国绝大多数人民的欢迎。为了使这个运动充分发生效力，它就必须超过为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动的令人注意的成果。为了达到这一目的，必须更加迅速地行动。这就大大有赖于全体共产党员的协助了。中央委员会号召法国共产党员进行广泛的解释运动，驳斥美国宣传机关关于德国问题所散布的谎言：吸引数以十万计的拥护和平的人参加抗议重新武装西德的签名运动，使全国请愿的这件事家喻户晓；积极坚持不渝地参加和平运动以使运动扩大；吸引所有居民参加这一运动，同时并加强这运动的组织。中央委员会唤起全党注意这个事实，即：反对武装西德的斗争决不能跟反对法国过分武装的斗争分开。决议称：进行与一切爱好自由的法国人联盟的政策，共产党就必须更加努力，争取工人阶级——独立与和平的基本力量，未来法国的支柱——的行动统一。在错综复杂的国际局势（这局势的特色是力量的对比不断地变得更加有利和平阵营）中，法国人民大众可以而且应该以自己有效的团结，使政府及其听命于美帝国主义而施行的奴役与战争政策归于失败。法国和平斗争的胜利目前就是足以彻底改变法国政策方针的充分条件。和平斗争的胜利，——这必然意味着马歇尔计划与大西洋公约的锁链的破裂，意味着法西斯拥护者的败北，意味着达到民主统一政府（它在人民的支持下将实施社会进步与自由、民族独立与和平的政策）的康庄大道。这就是展示在法国人民眼前的前景，这个前景的能否达到，将取决于他们的努力，而首先是取决于领导群众的全体党员坚持与奋发的努力。
