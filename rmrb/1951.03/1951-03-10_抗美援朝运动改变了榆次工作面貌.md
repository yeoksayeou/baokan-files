The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Changes the Face of Work in Yuci
By our special correspondent Wu Xiang
The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country movement in Shanxi Province began in early November of last year. After three months, this great patriotic movement has been launched on a large scale throughout the province. According to statistics from Liu Huan, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party County Committee in the county: during the movement, more than a thousand young people volunteered to join the Volunteer Army to go to Korea to fight, and more than three hundred women also requested to join the army or work as nurses in Korea. There were fifty-two cases of fathers sending off their sons, and seventeen cases of wives sending off their husbands. Through this movement, hundreds of cadres who were originally lying down and unwilling to work, and had serious thoughts of "retreat" and "changing shifts," became active. A large number of activists emerged during the movement; according to statistics from only fifty-two villages in the county, there were one thousand three hundred and eighty-two people. The relationship between the government and the people has become closer, the prestige of the Party and the League has been enhanced, and many people have requested to join the militia and the Party and the League.

If we compare the situation before the movement with the current situation, we can understand how much progress the ideological education of Resist America, Aid Korea has made in Yuci's work. Yuci was liberated in the summer of 1948 during the "Jinzhong Campaign." Under the long-term and cruel oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs, this originally relatively affluent plain had become an area where "weeds surrounded bunkers, and bunkers surrounded weeds." For two years, through land reform, mutual aid production, and diligent farming, the lives of the masses have been significantly improved; but at the same time, the idea of "closing the door to construction, burying oneself in production, and living a peaceful life" has grown. "Farmers who hand in grain are peaceful kings; it is right not to care about irrelevant matters." Many activists in the land reform are now unwilling to even attend meetings; many village cadres take a perfunctory attitude towards their work because they are reluctant to delay their own production, waiting to "change shifts." As a result, work cannot be promoted or expanded, and there are quite a few villages that are lifeless. In Guocun, Second District, at most half of the cadres attended each cadre meeting. In Dongnie Village, Fourth District, with a total of five hundred and ninety-six people, only twenty-odd people regularly attended winter school, and some even said: "What's the use of attending winter school? There are no realized benefits, no visible results, and no millet in winter school." In Liubao Village, Third District, there were twenty-seven party members, but apart from eight who were relatively active, the rest only moved when pushed, and five or six simply stopped working. Party member Bian Shan said: "Now we have houses and land, and we don't hold major positions. It's enough to do a good job in our own production!" The US imperialists launched a war of aggression against Korea, but it did not alarm them. Old man Qi Fuli said: "When the country is righteous, heaven's will is smooth; when officials are clean, the people are at peace; Chairman Mao leads well, and the Americans can't come." These few words can serve as a typical representation of the people's thinking at that time.

How was this situation reversed? How was the upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting homes, and defending the country set off?

The main thing is for leading cadres to conduct recollections and complaints with the masses. Here, let's take Guocun as an example again. After the district chief gave a current affairs report in the village, he convened cadres above the group leader level to guide them in discussing in light of the actual situation. Naturally, everyone complained: some had sons who were captured by the "Second War Zone"; some had fathers who were beaten to death by the Yan Xishan bandit gang in "self-confession and reincarnation"... There was too much suffering. When the meeting adjourned, many cadres who were originally passive in their work expressed in unison: "We can no longer be as perfunctory as in the past. We must resolutely continue. Because the enemy wants us not to do anything, so that they can come back and bully us." After the cadres' discussion, they held a mass meeting for discussion. In this village, not even half of the people attended cadre meetings in the past, let alone mass meetings. But this time, under the active mobilization and leading influence of the cadres, almost everyone came. At the mass meeting, the complaints were even more in-depth, and people made clear comparisons between their past and present lives: before liberation, more than 4,000 mu of the village's more than 7,000 mu of land was barren, but now it has all been planted; before liberation, the village only had thirty-six head of livestock, but now it has increased to more than seventy; before liberation, every family ate *shapeng* (a type of grass), but now even the worst can eat red sorghum; before liberation, no pigs or chickens could be seen in the village, but now pigs and chickens are in flocks. Old man Guo Santai said: "In the past, I always carried four certificates with me (ID card, travel permit, self-confession and reincarnation certificate, land certificate), but now no one asks me when I go to the city to see a play at night. Although I am fifty-three years old, I must resolutely defend this good time." Finally, everyone came to a conclusion: "When the US imperialists come in, the Second War Zone returns, the landlords rise up, and the common people suffer." This is the truth, and it is the truth that the masses have summed up based on their own personal experience, so it can become a huge material force, promoting all work forward. As a result, Guocun, which had always been considered the most backward, has seen various tasks become active.

Recalling grievances and comparing lives are most enlightening to the political consciousness of the masses. But at the same time, wrong ideas must be criticized, and the masses must be guided to conduct self-criticism. In fact, as long as the debate is unfolded in light of the actual situation, the masses can criticize their own wrong ideas and solve them well. Some of the masses in Dongnie Village, because they had eaten "foreign white flour" and "milk substitutes" "subsidized" by the US imperialists, and wore "rotten leather shoes," mistakenly regarded the US imperialists as friends, and the debate could not be resolved for a long time. Later, Qi Xuejin said: "Liu Jie! If you give me two mu of good land, I am willing to give you two packs of cigarettes. The US imperialists give us some small favors, but they only do things that are in their own interest!" After his point, everyone's thoughts were clear. Some said: "Eating white flour warms your heart, but making bullets takes your life." Some said: "The capital for Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war was all sent by the US imperialists. They use soft methods to kill people without showing their heads." In this way, the pro-American ideas were resolved. Because Nie Village solved the masses' wrong ideas and raised their awareness, the work in all aspects of winter production, tilling fields for military families, etc., has greatly improved. The number of people attending winter school has surged from more than twenty to more than three hundred. The supplementary grain levy, which could not be collected, was completed in one day by more than 11,000 catties. The cadres' "retreat" thoughts and "fear of delaying work" thoughts have also been "cured." Just as Cao Shunman, secretary of the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party in the village, said: "As long as the US imperialists exist for one day, we will fight against them for one day."

### 抗美援朝运动改变了榆次工作面貌

　　抗美援朝运动改变了榆次工作面貌
    本报特约记者  吴象
    山西省的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，是从去年十一月初开始的。经过三个月的时间，这一伟大的爱国主义运动，已在全省大规模地开展起来。据该县中国共产党县委书记刘寰的统计：运动中有一千多名青壮年自动要求参加志愿军赴朝鲜参战，还有三百多妇女也要求赴朝参军或做看护工作。父送子的有五十二个，妻送郎的有十七个。经过这一运动，有几百个原来躺倒不干有严重“退却”、“换班”思想的干部，变得积极起来。运动中并涌现出大批积极分子，仅据该县五十二个村的统计，就有一千三百八十二人。政府与人民的关系更密切了，党、团的威信更提高了，要求参加民兵、要求入党入团的人也很多。
    如果把运动前的情况拿来与现在的情况对比一下，就更可以明白，这次抗美援朝的思想教育，使榆次的工作前进了多么大的一步。榆次是一九四八年夏天“晋中战役”时解放的。在蒋介石、阎锡山匪帮长期残酷的压榨之下，这个原来相当富足的平川，已经变成“蒿草包围着碉堡，碉堡又包围着蒿草”的地带了。两年以来，经过土地改革、互助生产、勤劳耕作，群众生活已显著提高；但在同时，却滋生了“关门建设、埋头生产、过太平日子”的思想。“庄稼人交了粮，就是太平王；闲事不管是正经。”许多土地改革中的积极分子，现在竟连开会也不愿参加了；许多村干部因为嫌耽误自己生产而对工作采取应付的态度，等着“换班”。因而工作推不动，展不开，死气沉沉的村子，数目很是不少。二区郭村，每次开干部会最多到不了一半人。四区东聂村共五百九十六人，经常上冬学的只有二十几个人，有的还说：“上冬学有啥用？利益不兑现，成绩不见面，冬学里又没有小米。”三区六堡村有二十七个党员，除了八个还比较积极，其余都是推一推才动一动，有五、六个干脆就不干了。党员边山说：“现在咱房也有啦，地也分上啦，咱也不担任主要工作，把自己生产搞好就行啦！”美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并没有惊动了他们，齐富理老汉说：“国正天心顺，官清民自安；毛主席领导好，美国人来不了。”这几句话，很可以作为当时群众思想的典型代表。
    这种情况是怎样扭转的呢？抗美援朝保家卫国的热潮是怎样掀起来的呢？
    主要的是领导干部和群众进行回忆和诉苦。在这里，不妨再举郭村的例子。区长到村里作了时事报告之后，就召集小组长以上的干部，引导他们联系实际情况进行讨论。很自然地，大家都诉起苦来了：有儿子被“二战区”抓跑了的；有父亲被阎锡山匪帮“自白转生”乱棍打死的……苦太多太深了。散会时，好多原来工作消极的干部，都不约而同地表示：“再不能像过去一样应付工作了，一定要坚决地干下去。因为敌人正愿我们不干，好重新来欺侮我们。”干部讨论之后，接着又开群众会讨论。这村原来开干部会也到不了一半人，群众会就更不用说。但这次在干部的积极动员和带头影响下，却几乎全都来了。在群众会上，诉苦更深入了，人们把过去和现在的生活做了显明的对比：解放前全村七千多亩土地荒芜了四千多亩，现在已全部种上；解放前全村只有三十六头牲口，现在增加到七十多头；解放前家家吃莎蓬（草名），现在顶坏的也能吃红高粱；解放前村里根本看不见猪和鸡，现在猪鸡成了群。郭三太老汉说：“过去身上不离四个证（身份证、通行证、自白转生证、上地证），现在黑夜到城里看戏也没人问。我虽然五十三岁了，也要坚决保卫咱这好时光。”最后，大家做了一个结论：“美帝进来，二战区回来，地主起来，老百姓倒霉。”——这是真理，而且是群众根据自己切身经验总结出来的真理，因此就能变成巨大的物质力量，推动着一切工作前进。于是一向被认为是最落后的郭村，各种工作都活跃起来了。
    回忆诉苦对比生活最能启发群众的政治觉悟。但在同时，必须对错误的思想进行批判，引导群众进行自我批判。事实上，只要联系实际展开了争论，群众是能批判自己的错误思想，并且解决得很好的。东聂村有一部分群众，因为吃过美帝国主义“救济”的“洋白面”、“代乳粉”，穿过“烂皮鞋”，竟错误地把美帝国主义当成朋友，争论了很久不能解决。后来齐学进说：“刘杰！你给我两亩好地，我情愿送你两条纸烟。美帝国主义给咱些小恩小惠，人家是有利才干哪！”经他一点，大家思想都通了。有的说：“吃上白面暖你的心，造出子弹来要你的命。”有的说：“蒋介石打内战的本钱，都是美帝国主义送的，人家用的是杀人不露头的软办法。”就这样解决了亲美的思想。聂村因为解决了群众的错误思想，提高了觉悟，冬季生产、代耕优属等各方面的工作，都大有起色。上冬学的由二十余人激增至三百余人。一直收不起的补征粮，一天就完成了一万一千多斤。干部的“退却”思想和“怕误工”思想也都“治”好了。正像该村中国共产党村支部书记曹顺瞒说的：“美帝国主义存在一天，我们就要向它斗争一天。”
