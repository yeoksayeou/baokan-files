Ministry of Water Resources Issues Notice
　　Calling for Strengthening Inspection Work
　　Guaranteeing Smooth Progress of Projects
　　[Our Newspaper] Currently, the nationwide spring repair projects for water conservancy have fully commenced. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government recently issued a notice to strengthen the inspection work of water conservancy projects. The purpose of the inspection work is to discover problems in a timely manner, correct shortcomings, exchange experiences, improve work, avoid unnecessary losses and waste, and prevent the recurrence of past mistakes and biases. The content of the inspection work includes organizational leadership, project plans, expenditure of funds, and the maintenance of dikes and canals. This year's water conservancy project scale is larger than last year's. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government dispatched nine work inspection groups in early March to various regions and river basins across the country to conduct inspection work. In addition, various regions have also paid attention to inspection work. For example, the Northwest Region Water Conservancy Department, led by Minister Li Fudu and Vice Minister Ding Zhongwen, and Director of the Water Administration Office Hu Buchuan, formed three inspection teams, including engineers and associate engineers. They will successively go to Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces in March and April to inspect canal management and new project planning.
