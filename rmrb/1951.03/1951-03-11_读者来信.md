　　Suggestions from the People of the Capital on Solving Housing Problems
　　Editor's Note: In order to solve the serious housing shortage currently plaguing the capital, Comrade Peng Zhen, at the First Session of the Third Municipal People's Representative Conference of Beijing, raised the housing issue and listed it as one of the eight major tasks for this year. This wise measure has received enthusiastic support from the broad masses. Our newspaper has successively received many letters from readers, expressing gratitude to the government and putting forward many positive suggestions. We now publish excerpts below, hoping that the relevant authorities in Beijing will consider and respond to them.

　　Suggestions on Public-Private Joint Venture Real Estate Companies
　　Editor:
　　I have the following suggestions for solving the housing problem in Beijing:
　　1. I fully support Comrade Peng Zhen's statement in his opening speech at the First Session of the Third Municipal People's Representative Conference of Beijing: "The Municipal People's Government should mobilize and organize public and private forces to strive to build 15,000 to 20,000 rooms (excluding those built by central government agencies). To realize this plan, we should organize public-private joint venture real estate companies." This is a very wise measure. I suggest that public-private joint venture real estate companies should first purchase or lease public and private vacant land. For example, there is a lot of vacant land between Qianmen and Yongdingmen in the southern part of Beijing, and transportation is very convenient, so housing can be built there. Building materials can be used from various demolished old buildings (such as broken bricks and soil left over from the opening of the Chongwenmen gate) and the materials from dilapidated temples in the city that have no preservation and repair value.
　　Secondly, public-private joint venture real estate companies should take responsibility for repairing dilapidated houses in the city. Many houses in the capital are already dilapidated. If the original owners are unable to repair them and they become uninhabitable, the public-private joint venture real estate companies can repair them on their behalf; the rent paid by the tenants will be used to repay the cost in installments until it is paid off. This can preserve the original houses and prevent them from collapsing.
　　2. Under the leadership of public-private joint venture real estate companies, homeowners with 30 or more rental rooms should be gathered to form a joint association. All rental houses owned by members of the joint association should be managed and allocated by the joint association in a unified manner. Currently, many people in the capital work in the eastern part of the city but live in the western part; and some work in the western part but live in the eastern part. This situation can be resolved by the joint association, which can arrange for exchanges to reduce the waste of labor.
　　The housing shortage in the capital is a difficulty we encounter in our progress and development. This issue has been listed as one of the eight central tasks of Beijing Municipality this year, which is enough to show how much the People's Government cares about the interests of the people. I hope the relevant authorities will consider the above suggestions.

　　Expand the Work of Real Estate Exchanges and Prohibit Housing Sales Speculation
　　Editor:
　　The housing shortage in the capital is very serious. This is certainly due to the fact that the speed of housing construction in the capital cannot keep up with the increase in population and the rapid development of industry and commerce. However, I believe that some homeowners, seeing that there is profit to be made from buying and selling real estate, collude with "house brokers" (intermediaries who buy, sell, or lease houses) to engage in speculative housing sales, which further promotes the rise in house prices and rents. In the hutong where we live, we often see groups of "house brokers" leading people who want to buy houses to look around; at the same time, they are looking for ways to encourage homeowners to say: "If you are willing to sell, people can offer a high price. If you sell this house, I will be responsible for buying you another one and guarantee to clear it out for you." In order to earn commissions, they do not care about the difficulties of tenants moving. Furthermore, tenants who move also have to find "house brokers," otherwise they will not be able to find a place to live. Through such repeated purchases and sales, house prices have become inflated, more people cannot rent houses, and "house brokers" enrich themselves in the process. In order to eliminate these malpractices of buying and selling houses, I suggest that the Beijing Municipal People's Government should expand the work of the urban real estate exchange of the Land Administration Bureau and strengthen the management of real estate transactions. When a homeowner sells a house, they must first register in detail with the exchange, and those who buy a house must also register with the exchange. All transaction procedures must be handled at the exchange; any private transfers of money and contracts without registration shall be invalid. This can avoid the drawbacks of competing for houses and using houses as speculative objects to drive up house prices. Zhang Ming, et al.

　　Suggestions for Establishing Rent Grade Standards
　　Editor:
　　Since the promulgation of the "Provisional Rules for Private Housing Leasing in Beijing" last October, the chaotic situation in private housing lease relationships in the capital has been correctly resolved. However, because the rules did not clearly stipulate rent grades and limits, landlords have arbitrarily raised rents. Take the small side room where we live, which is eight and a half feet wide. In March last year, the monthly rent was 14 jin of millet; in October last year, it rose to 25 jin per month. Recently, the landlord has made another proposal, insisting on 52 jin of millet, and the landlord's endless rent increases are making it very difficult for us. Those who rent houses are generally working people and public employees, and high rents are unaffordable; in particular, it is inappropriate to affect work and production due to rent disputes. Therefore, we suggest that the relevant authorities quickly establish rent grade standards so that excessively high or low rents can be reasonably adjusted to protect legitimate housing ownership and proper leasing rights.

　　Hope to Rent Out Vacant Houses as Much as Possible
　　Editor:
　　In order to solve the housing problems of the broad masses of citizens in Beijing, the First Session of the Third Municipal People's Representative Conference of Beijing passed a resolution to build 15,000 to 20,000 rooms. We believe that the government, in the current situation of financial difficulties, can still care about and solve the people's living difficulties in this way. Therefore, we hope that citizens who have spare houses should also try to rent out their spare houses to help the government solve the housing shortage in the capital. This can not only increase their own income, but also reduce the government's difficulties and solve problems for the people. A Reader

　　Should Prohibit Raising Rents and Intermediaries' "Rotten" Rents
　　Editor:
　　Rent expenses have become a major burden in the lives of the working people in the capital. Recently, renting an ordinary house costs at least 40 to 50 jin of rice per month, and generally requires paying half a year's rent at once. For example, the north room in the cross-courtyard at No. 8 Jing'er Hutong costs 100 jin of rice per month, and half a year's rent—600 jin—must be paid before moving in. The west room at No. 44 Nanxiaojie costs 40 jin of rice per month, and four copies—160 jin—must be paid in the first month, and the leasing intermediary also takes a "rotten" share (gets one month's rent). Our monthly salary income can only maintain a low standard of living, and we are really unable to afford excessively high rents. In particular, these unreasonable exploitation phenomena should not exist.

    首都人民解决房屋问题的意见
    编者按：为解决目前首都房屋恐慌的严重现象，彭真同志在京市三届一次各界人民代表会议上，已将房屋问题提出，并列为今年八项主要工作之一。这一英明措施，得到广大群众的热烈拥护。本报已先后接到许多读者来信，除对政府表示感激外，并提出许多积极的建议。现择要发表如下，希京市有关机关考虑并答复。
    对公私合资房产公司的建议编辑同志：
    我对解决北京市的住房问题，有下面几点意见：
    一、我完全拥护彭真同志在北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议上的开幕词中提出的：“市人民政府应动员与组织公私力量，为增建一万五千到两万间房屋而奋斗（中央各机关修建之房屋在外）。为了实现这一计划，我们应该组织公私合资的房产公司。”这是一个非常英明的措施。我建议公私合资房产公司应先收买或租借公、私空地，如北京市南城的前门和永定门之间空地很多，交通也很方便，可以建筑住房。建房材料可利用各处拆除的各种旧建筑物的材料（如崇文门开门洞时遗下的碎砖土等）及本市没有保留和修建价值的破旧庙宇的材料。
    其次，公私合资房产公司应担负起修理本市破旧房屋的责任。首都有很多房屋早已破烂不堪，凡原业主无力修理而致不能住用者，可由公私合资房产公司代为修建；以房客所纳房租分期归还，至还清为止。这样可以保留原有房屋，不致坍毁。
    二、在公私合资房产公司领导下，集合有出租房屋三十间以上的房主，成立联合社。凡联合社社员所有出租的房屋，由联合社统筹支配。现在首都有许多人在东城工作而家住在西城；也有在西城工作家住在东城的。这种情况就可以由联合社负责予以调换，以减少劳动力的浪费。
    首都的房荒是我们在进步和发展中所遇到的困难。这一问题已列为北京市本年度八项中心工作之一，这也足以说明人民政府是如何关心人民的利益。上面意见，希望有关机关予以考虑。

    扩大房地产交易所工作禁止房屋买卖投机现象编辑同志：
    目前首都的房荒很严重。这固然是由于首都房屋增建的速度赶不上人口增加及工商业迅速发展的结果。但我认为一部分房主见买卖房产有利可图，便勾结“房纤”（买卖或租赁房屋的中间介绍人）做买卖房屋的投机生意，更加促进了房价和房租高涨的原因。在我们居住的胡同里，经常看见“房纤”三五成群，领着买房的人到处看房子；同时他们又到处找门路，鼓动房主说：“你们愿意出卖，人家可以出大价钱。你们把这所房子卖了，我负责给你多买一所，包管给你腾空房。”他们为了挣中佣钱，那管房客搬家有困难。再说房客搬家也得找“房纤”，否则就找不到房住。就这样辗转购卖，房价就腾贵起来了，更多的人租不到房住了，而“房纤”却从中自肥。为了杜绝这些买卖房屋的流弊，我建议：北京市人民政府应当扩大地政局城区房地产交易所的工作，加强房地产买卖的管理。房主卖房时必须先在交易所详细登记，买房的也须到交易所登记，一切买卖手续须在交易所办理；如未经登记而私自过款立契者一律无效。这样可以避免争购房屋，以房屋为投机对象哄抬房价的弊端。 章明等
  建议订定房租等级标准编辑同志：
    自去年十月北京市私有房屋租赁暂行规则公布以后，首都私有房屋租赁关系的混乱现象，有了正确解决的途径。但因该规则并未明确规定租额等级和界限，因此，产生了房主任意抬高房租的情形。拿我们住的一间宽八尺半的小厢房来说，在去年三月，每月房租是十四斤小米；去年十月时，涨到每月二十五斤，最近房东又提出意见来啦，非要五十二斤小米不行，房主这样漫无止境地涨房租，真使我们感到非常困难。租房的人一般都是劳动人民和公教人员，房租过高，是无法负担的；特别是为了房租纠纷而影响工作和生产尤其不妥。所以我们建议有关机关迅速订定房租等级标准，使过高或过低的房租，得到合理的调整，以保护合法的房屋所有权和正当的租赁使用权。

  希望尽量出租空余房屋编辑同志：
    为解决北京市广大市民住房问题，北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议通过了增建一万五千到两万间房屋的决议。我们认为政府在目前财政困难的情况下，尚能如此关心并解决人民的生活困难，因此希望家有余房的市民，也应该尽量将余房出租，以协助政府解决首都的房荒。这样既可以增加自己的收入，也为政府减少了困难，为人民解决了问题。 一读者
  应禁止抬高房租和中间人的“烂”租编辑同志：
    房租的支出，已成为首都劳动人民生活中主要的负担了。最近租一间普通的房屋，最少要四、五十斤米，一般还须一次缴纳半年租金。如井儿胡同八号跨院有北房两间，每月要一百斤米，未搬进之前即须先交半年的房租——六百斤。南小街四十四号有西房一间，每月四十斤米，头一个月要交四份——一百六十斤，租赁介绍人还要烂一份（得一个月的租金）。我们每月薪金收入只能维持较低的生活，实无力负担过高的房租。特别是这些不合理的剥削现象，尤其不应存在。
