　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 23rd (TASS dispatch): Three thousand five hundred people here held a rally to celebrate the release of American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis from prison.
    All speakers at the meeting emphasized the enormous importance of intensifying the struggle for peace. In their speeches, Dennis and CPUSA National Secretary Hall particularly emphasized the contributions of the Soviet and Chinese people, pointing out that the people of these two countries have created new possibilities for the struggle for world peace. Dennis said: The struggle for peace is of decisive importance. It will affect the lives of the American people for decades. If the people work hard in a united front with determination, it is still possible to prevent the disaster of a third world war.
    Other speakers at the conference included: Communist Labor Secretary Williamson, CPUSA New York State Committee Chairman Thompson, and CPUSA National Committee member and Black woman Jones.
    Note: CPUSA General Secretary Dennis, who was released from prison on the 12th of this month, was unreasonably sentenced to ten months in prison for "contempt" of Congress for refusing to answer questions from the US House Un-American Activities Committee. The U.S. government's shameless atrocities in imprisoning Communist leaders have been strongly protested by the American people.

　　美国人民举行集会
    庆祝但尼斯出狱
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：此间有三千五百人举行集会，庆祝美国共产党总书记但尼斯出狱。
    所有在会上发言的人都强调加紧争取和平的斗争的巨大重要性。但尼斯和美共全国书记霍尔在发言中特别强调苏联和中国人民的贡献，他们指出这两国人民已为争取世界和平的斗争创造了新的可能性。但尼斯说：争取和平的斗争，是具有决定性的重要意义的。它将影响美国人民数十年的生活。人民如果坚决在统一战线中努力奋斗，那么，仍旧可以防止发生第三次世界大战的灾难。
    在大会上发言的还有：共产党劳工书记威廉逊、美共纽约州委主席汤普生、美共全国委员会委员黑人妇女琼恩斯。
    按：本月十二日出狱的美共总书记但尼斯，是因拒绝答复美国众院非美活动委员会的问题，而被以“蔑视”国会罪无理判处十个月徒刑的。美国政府监禁共产党领袖的无耻暴行，曾遭到美国人民的强烈抗议。
