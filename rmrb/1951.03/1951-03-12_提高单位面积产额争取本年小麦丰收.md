Increase Unit Area Yield and Strive for a Bumper Wheat Harvest This Year
       Li Shijun, Tian Huonong
    Wheat is one of China's main food crops. After the land reform and the great production movement in the countryside, the lives of farmers have generally improved; in the cities, prices have stabilized, private industry and commerce have returned to normal and developed, and people's lives have also improved day by day, thus the demand for "fine grains" has been increasing. In Beijing and Tianjin, for example, "fine grains" have changed from one-third to two-thirds as the main food. Therefore, striving for a bumper wheat harvest is very important.
    In 1950, the national wheat harvest was affected by excessive spring rains, and in some areas of East China and Central South China, some wheat grew poorly and some were drowned by standing water. Then there was a fairly widespread occurrence of yellow rust (unprecedented in some areas of North China for fifty or sixty years), which is estimated to have reduced production by about 20 to 30 percent of the total yield. In terms of insect pests, the damage caused by wheat sawfly and red spider in North China and wheat midges in Shaanxi and Henan also resulted in significant losses. As a result, the average yield of wheat per mu nationwide last year was only 94 jin. By region, it was 96 jin in Northeast China, 47 jin in Inner Mongolia (due to drought), 79 jin in North China, 125 jin in Northwest China, 82 jin in East China, 96 jin in Central South China, and 143 jin in Southwest China.
    According to the requirements of the grain production increase plan, the unit area yield of wheat in 1951 should be increased by at least 10 percent compared with last year in order to complete or exceed the total wheat production plan. This is one of the major tasks of agricultural production this spring, and should attract the attention of our leading departments at all levels.
    It should be pointed out that increasing the unit area yield of wheat is entirely possible. First of all, the wheat sown last winter was generally more meticulously cultivated and harrowed than in previous years, and the quantity and quality of fertilizer applied have also been improved. For example, in Shanxi, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has generally increased by 5 to 10 dan, and in the Laiyang area of Shandong, it has generally increased by about 2 tuo. Secondly, the area of improved varieties推广 has reached 3.53 million mu, and the sown area treated with seed soaking and mixing to prevent and control diseases has also increased greatly. For example, in Shanxi Province, the amount of seed soaked, mixed, and sown accounted for 40 percent of the total, and in Zanhuang County, Hebei Province, the number of households soaking seeds reached 70 percent. East China has centrally processed 8 million jin of seeds; in addition, the area using red arsenic and other methods to prevent and control underground pests has also increased compared with previous years. In addition, heavy snowfalls several times this year in various places will also play a great role in increasing wheat production. Therefore, we must build on this good foundation and conscientiously do the following tasks to ensure that the average yield of wheat per mu increases by 10 percent or even more compared with last year.
    1. Increase topdressing: One of the basic reasons for the low unit area yield of wheat is that too little fertilizer is applied. Field observations have proved that yield can only be increased if the fertilizer is sufficient and the wheat seedlings grow strongly. At the same time, wheat is a deep-rooted crop, so early topdressing (preferably when the wheat begins to recover growth), followed by hoeing and irrigation (spring rain in dry land can also permeate), can fully absorb the fertilizer.
    2. Universally promote hoeing and weeding: Experience has shown that hoeing and weeding wheat can resist drought, reduce rust disease, increase yield, and improve quality. According to Shandong's experience, hoed wheat weighs 2.5 jin more per dou than unhoed wheat. In recent years, the promotion of hoeing wheat in various places has achieved great success. In Shanxi, cultivated and hoed wheat accounts for 81 percent of the total wheat area, and most other areas have also been hoed one to two times. This year, we must continue to expand the area of hoeing and weeding on this basis. In the Jiangnan area, wheat is mostly broadcast sown and cannot be hoed, but there are many weeds, so weeding should be promoted. Generally, hoeing should be carried out when the wheat begins to recover growth. Wheat in irrigated areas should be hoed once after each watering, or in dry areas after rain, until after the earing stage, when hoeing can be stopped.
    3. Timely irrigation and drainage: In North China, irrigation of wheat should start after Qingming. As the saying goes: "The first watering should be slow, the second watering should be quick, and the third watering should be large." That is to say, the first watering should be later and the amount of water should not be too large; the second watering should be carried out when the ground has not dried after the first watering; and the third watering (usually during the jointing stage) should be large. However, in areas where water sources are scarce and prone to drought, early watering (in conjunction with more topdressing) can reduce the losses caused by drought and increase yield. According to surveys by the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Hebei Provincial Farm, appropriate but not excessive irrigation can increase yield and will not aggravate yellow rust. Especially when yellow rust is severe, the amount of water evaporated from the leaves increases, requiring more water; if drought occurs at this time, production will inevitably be reduced, and close attention must be paid. Of course, yellow rust is more serious in areas with excessive irrigation and low-lying water accumulation, so excessive irrigation should be avoided and attention should be paid to draining standing water. In Jiangnan, where there is more rainfall, good drainage of wheat fields must be ensured.
    4. Eliminate and control insect pests: Wheat sawfly and red spider in North China cause considerable damage and should be eliminated and controlled in a timely manner. Successful experience in eliminating and controlling wheat sawfly is: at night, use a dustpan to push over the wheat ridges, because the dustpan touches the wheat seedlings, the wheat sawfly will immediately fall into the dustpan, and can be captured and killed. Or use a small cart similar to a cutworm (armyworm) cart (the cloth bag should be pressed lower) to capture and kill, the effect is also very large. According to research by the Baoding Farm, red spider can also be eliminated and controlled using a catcher similar to a cutworm boat. Some people use two large hoes to push the wheat ridges, the front hoe is tied with a crossbar, to touch the wheat seedlings forward, so that the red spider falls on the ground, and the rear hoe immediately crushes the red spider to death, which is also very effective. According to Hebei's experience, watering can also reduce the damage caused by red spider.
    Finally, in spring wheat areas, the sown area of spring wheat can be appropriately expanded, and early spring sowing should be promoted to reduce the occurrence and losses of stem rust, and the control of spring wheat loose smut should be vigorously carried out. This is also a strong guarantee for increasing the total wheat yield.

　　提高单位面积产额争取本年小麦丰收
       李世俊　田活农
    小麦是我国主要食粮之一。在农村土地改革和大生产运动后，农民生活普遍提高；在城市，物价稳定，正当工商业得到了正常的恢复和发展，人民生活也日益改善，因而对“细粮”的需要，日见增加。如北京、天津两地的“细粮”，已由三分之一转为三分之二作为主要食粮。所以，争取小麦丰产，很是重要。
    一九五○年全国的小麦收获，因为春雨过多，华东和中南部分地区，有的生长不良，有的被积水浸死。接着又发生了相当普遍的黄锈病（华北某些地区为五、六十年来所未有），据估计减产数约占总产量的百分之二十至三十。在虫害方面，华北的麦叶蜂、红蜘蛛及陕西、河南的吸浆虫等的为害，亦损失不少。因之，去年全国小麦每亩平均产额仅及九十四斤。按地区说，东北九十六斤，内蒙四十七斤（因旱），华北七十九斤，西北一二五斤，华东八十二斤，中南九十六斤，西南一四三斤。
    按照粮食增产计划要求，一九五一年的小麦单位面积产额应至少较去年提高一成，才能完成或超过小麦生产计划的总产量。这是今春农业生产的重大任务之一，亟应引起我们各级领导部门的重视。
    应该指出，提高小麦单位面积产额是完全可能的。首先，因为去冬播种的小麦，无论耕或耙一般均较往年精细，施肥的量与质亦有提高。如山西每亩普遍增施肥料五至十担，山东莱阳专区一般增施二驮左右。其次，优良品种推广已达三五三万亩，经浸种拌种防除病害的播种面积亦大为增加。如山西省浸种、拌种、播种量达百分之四十，河北赞皇县浸种户达百分之七十，华东曾集中处理种子八百万斤；其他如使用红砒霜等防除地下害虫的面积亦较往年增多。加之今年各地普降大雪数次，对小麦增产亦将起很大作用。因此，我们必须在这良好的基础上，认真做好下列几项工作，以保证每亩小麦较去年平均增产一成甚至超过一成。
    一、增施追肥：小麦单位面积产额不高的基本原因之一，是施肥太少。据田间观察证明，只有在肥料相当充足、麦苗生长健壮的情况下，产量才能增加。同时，小麦是深根性的作物，早施追肥（最好在小麦开始恢复生长时即施用），然后加以中耕灌溉（旱地有春雨亦可渗透），才能充分吸收肥分。
    二、普遍推行中耕除草：经验证明，小麦中耕除草，可以抗旱，可以减轻锈病，以增加产量、提高质量。据山东的经验，锄过的麦较未锄的每斗重二斤半。近年各地推广锄麦，已获得很大成绩，山西耘锄的小麦占小麦总面积的百分之八十一，其他地区亦大部锄一至二遍。今年仍须在此基础上扩大中耕除草面积。江南小麦多撒播，不能中耕，而杂草很多，应推行拔草。一般中耕以在小麦开始恢复生长时进行为宜。灌溉地小麦每次浇水后或旱地在雨后，即须中耕一次，至孕穗后，才可停止。
    三、及时灌溉与排水：在华北灌溉小麦以清明后开始为宜，农谚有谓：“头水慢，二水赶，三水大。”就是说，浇第一次水要晚些，且水量不宜太大；浇第二次应赶上第一次浇后地面未干时进行；浇第三次（一般是抽茎期）水量要大。但在水源缺少，易受旱干地区，为了利用春水，早浇（配合多施追肥）可以减少旱害的损失，可以增加产量。据华北农业科学研究所及河北省农场的调查，适当的而不是过量的灌溉，可以提高产量，也不致使黄锈病因而加重。特别在黄锈病严重时，叶面蒸发量增加，更需要多量的水份；这时如遇干旱，势必减产，必须密切注意。当然，过量灌溉及低洼积水地方，黄锈病是比较严重的，应避免过量灌溉及注意排泄积水。江南雨水较多，务使麦田排水良好。
    四、除治虫害：华北麦叶蜂和红蜘蛛为害相当大，应及时除治。除治麦叶蜂成功的经验是：夜间用簸箕在麦垅上推过，因簸箕触动麦苗，麦叶蜂随即掉入簸箕内，即可捕杀。或用类似黏虫（行军虫）车的小车（布袋要按得低些）捕杀，效果也很大。除治红蜘蛛，据保定农场研究，亦可用类似黏虫船的捕打器捕杀。有的用两张大锄推麦垅，前一张大锄缚一横木，向前触动麦苗，使红蜘蛛掉落地上，后一张大锄紧接将红蜘蛛挫死，收效也很大。据河北的经验，浇水亦可减轻红蜘蛛的为害。
    最后，在春麦区，可以适当扩大春小麦播种面积，并提倡早春播种，以减免秆锈病的发生和损失，大力防除春小麦的黑穗病，这也是增加小麦总产量的有力保证。
