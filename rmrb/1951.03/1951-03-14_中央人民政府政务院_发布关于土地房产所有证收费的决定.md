　　Central People's Government, Government Administration Council
    Issues Decision on Fees for Land and Property Ownership Certificates
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has issued the "Decision on Fees for Land and Property Ownership Certificates." The main points are as follows:
    After the completion of land reform in various regions, when issuing land and property ownership certificates (or land certificates), a land certificate fee should be collected, and the standard is generally divided into two categories, A and B, both calculated in fine grains (rice, millet, wheat). Paddy fields and courtyard house foundations are classified as Category A, with a charge of five *jin* per *mu*; dry land is classified as Category B, with a charge of two and a half *jin* per *mu*. The fine grains collected should be converted into Renminbi based on the local market average grain price, calculated by the *zhuanqu* or county; if payment in cash is difficult, grain can be paid. However, in areas with sparse populations or barren land, the charging standard may be appropriately reduced, to be drafted by the provincial and municipal people's governments and submitted to the Great Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee) for approval, and reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for record; centrally administered municipalities and provinces should directly report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for approval. The cost of materials and labor required for the land certificate shall be covered by the land certificate fee collected, and no additional material costs or other fees shall be charged. For land and property that has already been issued a land certificate, if there are any transfers such as buying and selling, pawning, gifting, or exchanging, the procedures for obtaining a deed and paying taxes shall be handled in accordance with the Deed Tax Regulations, and no land certificate will be issued again, nor will a land certificate fee be charged again. Land certificates issued before the promulgation of this method will not be reissued or supplemented with land certificate fees.
    The decision pointed out: All levels of people's government should attach importance to this work, and carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization with leadership and planning, so that the masses understand the rationale for charging fees, and should not do things perfunctorily. The fee collection work in areas where land reform has been completed before the autumn harvest this year must be completed before the end of November. The people's governments of the major administrative regions (military and political committees) and the people's governments of the centrally administered provinces and cities may formulate implementation measures based on this decision and with reference to local specific conditions, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for the record.

　　中央人民政府政务院
    发布关于土地房产所有证收费的决定
    中央人民政府政务院发布《关于土地房产所有证收费的决定》。其要点如下：
    各地在完成土地改革以后，颁发土地房产所有证（或土地证）时，应收土地证费，其标准一般分为甲、乙两类，均以细粮（大米、小米、小麦）计算。水田及场院宅基为甲类，每市亩收五市斤；旱地为乙类，每市亩收二市斤半。所收细粮，应以专区或县为单位，按当地市场平均粮价折收人民币；如交款困难，可交粮食。惟在地广人稀或土地硗瘠地区，收费标准可酌予降低，由省、市人民政府拟订报大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）核准，并报中央人民政府财政部备案；中央直辖省市迳报中央人民政府财政部核准。土地证所需工本费，准在所收土地证费内开支，不得再收工本费或其他费用。凡已领有土地证的土地房产，如有买卖、典当、赠与、交换等转移情事，概按契税条例办理领契完税手续，不再发土地证，亦不再收土地证费。在本办法颁布前已发土地证者，不另换发，亦不补收土地证费。
    决定指出：各级人民政府应重视此项工作，有领导有计划地深入宣传动员，使群众了解收费的道理，不得潦草从事。今年秋收以前完成土地改革地区的收费工作，须于十一月底以前办理完竣。各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）及中央直属省市人民政府得根据本决定参照当地具体情况，制订实施办法，报请中央人民政府财政部备案。          （新华社）
