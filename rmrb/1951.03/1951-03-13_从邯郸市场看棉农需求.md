Seeing Cotton Farmer Needs From the邯郸 Market
       Lǐ Pǔ
    The bumper cotton harvest has brought prosperity to邯郸 town. Cotton farmers are currently the group with the highest purchasing power in rural areas, and they are buying a large variety of items, leaving even the most experienced and far-sighted merchants unable to prepare in time.
  Fine Grains and Cloth
    The surge in sales of fine grains in the邯郸 market is one of the unexpected phenomena. In January of this year, the sales volume of fine grains was 2.6 times that of the same period last year, accounting for 51.6% of the total sales volume of various grains for the entire month, while it only accounted for 19.05% in the same period last year. This significant increase in the sales volume of fine grains began in September of last year. Whether it was flour, rice, or wheat, the sales volume in September alone exceeded the total sales volume of the entire first or second quarter. In February, May, and July-August of last year, there were no rice sales at all. From September to January of this year, the average monthly sales reached as much as 600,000 jin. Wheat was originally one of the main products of the邯郸 area, and relevant authorities had arranged outlets for it, but now most of it is being sold within the area.
    邯郸 town sold more than 11,700 bolts of various types of cloth in January of this year, an increase of about one-third compared to the same period last year. And January of last year was precisely the time when false purchasing power was rampant, and people valued goods over currency. Out of the more than 60,000 bolts of various cloths sold throughout last year, half were sold in the fourth quarter. The above two figures only represent the quantity handled by the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company and some private cloth merchants, and do not include the quantity handled by the state-owned department store and cooperatives themselves. A large amount of printed cloth is also not included. The patterned cotton fabrics produced in Shanghai and Tianjin are extremely popular among cotton farmers. In recent months, young women and children from cotton-producing families have almost universally made new floral clothes and floral quilts. Many cloth merchants bring them directly from the production areas and sell them retail in their own stores, so the quantity cannot be calculated. In addition, cotton farmers who are getting married also need a lot of silk. In recent months, the sales of Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk in the market have been quite good, and many of them have been bought by cotton farmers.
    Cotton farmers also need a large amount of fuel and fodder. Sorghum stalks and wheat straw can be burned as firewood, and hay can feed livestock, but cotton branches and leaves are not enough to meet these needs. As the planting area of cotton increases, this problem becomes even greater. In January of this year, the unloading volume at the邯郸 Railway Station increased by nearly seven times compared to the same period last year; coal usually accounts for about half of the freight volume.
  Means of Production
    In terms of major means of production, what exactly do cotton farmers need? How much do they need? This is the question people are most concerned about. According to the estimation of the CCP邯郸 Prefectural Committee in the second half of last year, the entire area needed approximately 160 million jin of fertilizer and 80,000 various agricultural tools for the whole year. It is not possible to tally how much was actually supplied at this time. Judging from the邯郸 market before and after the Spring Festival, black beans are in short supply. This is a commonly used fertilizer by local farmers. The邯郸 State-owned Department Store sold 604 sets of rubber tires last year, because cotton farmers have bought a lot of livestock from afar in recent months, and large carts have also increased significantly as a result. The rural demand for waterwheels has also not been met. Cheng'an County is the county with the most cotton planting, the highest yield, and the best varieties in the邯郸 area. This county bought many new-style weeding hoes, cotton seeders, and Bagua handcarts last year. According to a survey in late November last year, Da Yaobao Village in that county alone was still preparing to buy 30 of these items. The sales volume of general agricultural tools has increased even more, but because there are many types, the quantity is even more difficult to calculate. The largest iron pot shop in邯郸, called Hongxiang, sold 63.5 tons of goods in January of this year, three times the amount in the same period last year. In addition to pots and stove bars, this also included a large number of simple agricultural tools. At the same time, advanced farmers have begun to yearn for complex agricultural machinery. Last winter, cotton farmers in Xiaohe Village, District One, Wu'an County, sent a representative to Beijing to visit tractors.
  Daily Necessities
    In addition to purchasing the above-mentioned necessary major materials, cotton farmers also need many daily necessities. From the end of September last year,邯郸 town held an eight-day mountain goods, medicinal materials, general merchandise, and mules and horses fair. Within the first two days of the fair, the flashlights and batteries of the state-owned department store and 35 private general merchandise stores were all sold out. According to the statistics of 15 department stores, a total of 269 flashlights and 2,142 batteries were sold in two days. According to a survey in Weixi Village, Cheng'an County, this cotton-rich village has 400 households. In the two months or so after the autumn harvest, each household bought an average of two new flashlights, and every four households bought a new bicycle. These bicycles were reassembled with old frames and cost only a little more than 200 jin of seed cotton, or about 500,000 yuan in Renminbi. This is not too much of a number for those cotton farmers who earn two or three thousand jin of seed cotton. Therefore, people here will tell you such things at any time: a certain village that originally had no bicycles now has dozens of them. In addition, the department store sold 3,410 boxes of glass last year, which was mainly sold in the last four months. Some of this glass was bought by cotton farmers to install windows, and some was bought by small producers to add mercury to make mirrors and sell them to cotton farmers. During the period when new cotton was on the market in September and October, items such as towels, socks, sneakers, rubber shoes, woolen shirts, sweaters, and thermos bottles with bamboo shells were almost sold out no matter how many there were. Even Shanghai's high-quality towels, hair oil, soap, and cold cream, which are not cheap, were bought by many young farm women. As for "small goods" such as combs, hairpins, and sewing needles, sales were even more brisk. A peddler pushing a cart of this kind of "small goods" to a cotton-producing village can exchange it for thousands of jin of seed cotton at once.
    The extent of cotton farmers' purchasing power can be seen from the following fact. From the time new cotton was put on the market in September of last year to the end of December, state-owned companies and private cotton merchants in the邯郸 area purchased at least 40 million jin of ginned cotton. At 7,500 yuan per jin, each of the 3.5 million people in the area could get more than 85,000 yuan. Last year, cotton fields in the area only accounted for a little more than 25% of the total cultivated land area, and the western mountainous area was completely unsuitable for cotton planting. Therefore, so much money is mainly concentrated in those counties, villages, and farm households that produce more cotton.
    Last year, the people's governments and Communist Party organizations at all levels in the cotton-producing areas spent a lot of effort persuading and leading farmers to grow cotton. As a result, the cotton planting area in the邯郸 area last year increased by 88% compared to the previous year. Now farmers have generally seen the benefits of growing cotton, and this year's cotton fields will inevitably expand further, and the output will also increase even more. This is entirely foreseeable. Currently, it is the time of spring plowing, and farmers' demand for means of production is becoming more and more urgent day by day. They urgently need a large amount of fertilizer, agricultural tools, and pesticides. At the same time, it is only a few months away from the next harvest season. How to meet the ever-increasing demand for industrial products in rural areas is the question raised by the cotton-producing areas. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Editor's note: This manuscript reflects the urgent demand of cotton farmers and all farmers in the old liberated areas for industrial products after the bumper harvest. The demand of farmers in the new areas after the land reform will also gradually increase. Trade departments in various places should pay full attention to this. In the work of material exchange, on the one hand, we should vigorously open up sales channels for rural native products; on the other hand, we should try our best and organize private merchants to transport a large amount of industrial products to rural areas to meet this need of farmers.
    We hope that special correspondents and correspondents in various places will write more news and communications reporting on the rapid growth of farmers' purchasing power after the land reform and reflecting the urgent demands of the masses and send them to us.

### 从邯郸市场看棉农需求

　　从邯郸市场看棉农需求
       李普
    棉花丰收给邯郸镇带来了繁荣。棉农是目前农村中购买力最高的人，他们大量地购买着各种各样的东西，使最有经验和远见的商人也来不及准备。
  细粮布匹
    邯郸市场上细粮销售量的激增是大出人们意料的现象之一。今年一月，细粮的销售量为去年同期的二点六倍，占全月各种粮食总销量的百分之五十一点六，而去年同期仅占百分之十九点零五。细粮销售量的这样大量的增加是从去年九月就开始的。无论面粉、大米或小麦，九月份一个月的销售量比第一季或第二季全季的销售量还要多。去年二月、五月和七、八两月内，大米完全没有买卖，从九月到今年一月，每月平均竟销售了六十万斤之多。小麦本来是邯郸专区的主要产品之一，有关机关曾经为它安排了出路，而现在却大部分在本区销纳了。
    邯郸镇今年一月实销各种布一万一千七百多匹，比去年同期约增三分之一。而去年一月，正是虚假购买力作祟，人们重物轻币的时候。去年全年销售各种布六万多匹，其中一半是在第四季卖出的。上述这两个数字只是国营花纱布公司和一部分私营布商经营的数量，没有包括国营百货公司和合作社本身所经营的在内。还有大量的花布也没有包括在内。上海和天津出产的那些棉织的花哔叽极为棉农欢迎。几个月来产棉之家的青年妇女和小孩们几乎普遍地新制了花衣服和花被子。许多布商直接从产地运来，在自己的门市上零售，那数量是没法统计的。此外，办婚事的棉农还需要许多丝绸。几个月来市上江浙丝绸的销路很不坏，其中有许多就是被棉农买去的。
    棉农们还需要大量的燃料和饲料。高粱秆和麦秸可以当柴烧，谷草可以喂牲口，棉花的枝叶却不足以适应这些用途。随着植棉面积的增加，这个问题也更大。今年一月邯郸火车站的卸货量比去年同期增加约近七倍；通常煤炭约占火车运货量的一半。
  生产资料
    在主要的生产资料方面，棉农究竟需要些什么？需要多少？这是人们最关心的问题。据中共邯郸地委会去年下半年的估计，全区全年约需肥料一亿六千万斤，各种农具八万件。实际供应了多少，一时还无法统计。从春节前后的邯郸市场看来，黑豆是供不应求的。这是当地农民惯用的肥料。邯郸国营百货公司去年出售了橡胶轮胎六百零四套，因为几个月来棉农到远地买了许多牲口回来，大车也随之大量地增加了。农村对于水车的需要，也还没有得到满足。成安县是邯郸专区植棉最多、产量最大、品种最好的县份，这一县去年购买了许多新式的耘锄、耩花耧和八卦小车等等。据去年十一月下旬的调查，仅该县大姚堡村就还准备购买三十件这类的东西。一般农具的销量，增加得更多，但是因为它们种类繁多，数量更难计算。邯郸最大的一家叫做鸿祥的铁锅店，今年一月的销货重量为六十三吨半，为去年同期的三倍。其中除锅子和炉条等等以外，还包括大量简单的农具在内。同时，先进的农民已经开始向往于复杂的农业机器了。去年冬天武安县一区小贺庄的棉农们曾经派了一个代表到北京参观拖拉机。
  生活用品
    棉农除了购买上述种种必需的主要物资之外，还需要很多生活用品。邯郸镇从去年九月末开始，举行了一次为期八天的山货药材百货骡马大会。会期的开头两天内，国营百货公司和三十五家私营百货店的手电筒和电池就全部卖光。据十五家百货店的统计，两天内共卖出电筒二百六十九个，电池二千一百四十二节。据成安县魏西村的调查，这个盛产棉花的村子有四百户人家，在秋后两个多月内，平均每户新买了两个手电筒，每四户新买了一辆自行车。这种自行车是用旧架子重新装配起来的，每辆不过二百多斤籽花，合人民币五十万元左右。这对于那些收入两三千斤籽花的棉农来说，并不是一个太了不起的数目。因此这里的人们随时会告诉你这样的事：某一个村子原来一辆自行车也没有的，现在有了好几十辆。此外，百货公司去年销售了玻璃三千四百一十箱，这主要是在后四个月卖出的。这些玻璃，一部分被棉农买去装了窗户，一部分被小生产者买去加上水银作镜子卖给了棉农。在新花上市的九、十月间，毛巾、袜子、球鞋、胶鞋、绒衣、毛衣、带竹壳的暖水瓶这些东西，也差不多有多少可以卖多少。甚至于价钱并不便宜的上海上等毛巾、头油、香皂、雪花膏，许多青年农妇也买起来。至于梳子、发夹和缝衣针之类的“碎货”，销路更畅。一个小贩推一车子这类“碎货”到一个产棉花的村子，可以一下换到千把斤籽花。
    棉农的购买力高到什么程度，从下面的一个事实中可以看出。从去年九月新花上市到十二月底，国营公司和私营花商在邯郸专区至少收购了皮棉四千万斤，每斤以七千五百元计，全区三百五十万人口每人可得八万五千多元。去年全区棉田仅占总耕地面积百分之二十五强，西部山地完全不适合种植棉花，因此，这样多的钱，主要是集中在那些产棉较多的县份、村庄和农家手中。
    去年产棉区各级人民政府和共产党组织曾费了很大力量说服和领导农民种棉，因此邯郸专区去年的植棉面积比前年扩大了百分之八十八。现在农民普遍看到了植棉的好处，今年棉田必然更要扩大，产量也将增加得更多，这是完全可以预期的。目前正是春耕时候，农民对生产资料的需求正在一天天迫切起来，他们急需大量的肥料、农具和农药。同时，现在距离下一个收获季节也不过几个月工夫。怎样来满足农村日益增涨的对工业品的需要，这就是产棉区提出的问题。          （新华社）
    编者按：这篇稿子反映了丰收后老解放区棉农和全体农民对工业品的迫切需求。土地改革后的新区农民，这种要求也将逐步增加。各地贸易部门对此应加以充分注意。在物资交流工作中，一方面应大力为农村土产打开销路；另一方面，则要尽力设法，并组织私商一起，把工业品大量运往农村，以满足农民的这种需要。
    这种报道土地改革后农民购买力迅速增长，反映群众迫切要求的稿件，希望各地特约记者、通讯员多多写成新闻、通讯寄来。
