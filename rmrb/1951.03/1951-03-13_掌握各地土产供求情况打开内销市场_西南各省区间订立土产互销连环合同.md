Mastering Local Product Supply and Demand to Open Up the Domestic Market
    Southwest Provinces Sign Inter-Provincial Serial Contracts for Mutual Sales of Local Products

    The state-owned trading departments in Southwest China, having learned from the experiences and lessons of 1950, where insufficient attention to the domestic sales of local products affected the timely exchange of some of them, are taking steps this year. First, they are changing the conservative mindset of "waiting for customers to come," dispatching cadres to major cities across the country to investigate the supply and demand of local products and to promote and introduce Southwest China's local products to expand external sales. Second, at the Third Southwest Regional Trade Work Conference, concrete measures were proposed for provinces within the region to sign inter-provincial transport and sales contracts for local products in order to expand domestic sales. At the conference, the local product companies of each province signed serial contracts for the mutual promotion and sale of local products for 1951. The first batch of local products to be mutually promoted and sold includes: South Sichuan selling to West Sichuan 10,000 dan of ramie, 100,000 bolts of burlap, 3,000 dan of flue-cured tobacco, 2 million sheets of counterpart paper, as well as willow tobacco and Mao tobacco; and selling to North Sichuan 200 dan of black fungus and 100 dan of daylilies. West Sichuan selling to South Sichuan 2,000 dan of candied orange, 1,500 dan of tea, 300 dan of longan, and portions of dried bamboo shoots, taro slices, white melon seeds, winter vegetables, and mustard sprouts; and West Sichuan selling to North Sichuan 500,000 taels of raw silk, 30,000 bolts of homespun cloth, and portions of white fungus and black fungus. Guizhou selling to West Sichuan 5,000 jin of Lingbao jujubes, and selling to South Sichuan 5,000 umbrellas, 10,000 combs, and 100 dan of Daqu liquor.

    In addition, after the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee announced the reduction of shipping costs for 33 types of local products starting from the 21st of this month, local product merchants have responded positively, and the Chongqing medicinal materials market has shown signs of activity. Local medicinal materials in this region, such as yellow ginger, white ginger, dried tangerine peel, and croton, which were previously unmanaged due to high transportation costs, are now being purchased by many in the market. This proves that the reduction of shipping costs for local products stimulates the external sales of Southwest China's local products. The fact that yellow ginger, white ginger, dried tangerine peel, and croton have begun to be sold externally proves that reducing shipping costs will not only not reduce the income of shipping companies but will also gain new revenue from increased freight volume.

    Editor's Note: Organizing the domestic sales of local and special products through a contract system is a good way to expand their sales channels. While expanding external sales, the Southwest region's approach to organizing domestic sales is necessary. In addition to organizing exchanges between provinces, exchanges should also be organized between counties within a province, and between districts and even villages and towns within a county. Through extensive exchanges, a crisscrossing commercial relationship can be formed, thoroughly opening up the sales channels for local and special products.

### 掌握各地土产供求情况打开内销市场  西南各省区间订立土产互销连环合同

　　掌握各地土产供求情况打开内销市场
    西南各省区间订立土产互销连环合同
    西南国营贸易部门接受一九五○年对土产内销重视不够而影响部分土产的及时交流的经验教训，在本年度起，首先改变“等客上门”的保守思想，派干部到全国各主要城市调查土产供求情况，宣传介绍西南区的土产以扩大外销；其次在西南区第三届贸易工作会议，提出全区省与省之间，相互订立土产运销合同的具体办法以扩大内销。各省土产公司在会议上即订立了一九五一年度互相推销土产的连环合同。首批互相推销的土产计有：川南代川西销大麻一万担、麻袋布十万匹、大烟叶三千担、对方纸二百万张及柳烟、毛烟等；代川北销黑木耳二百担、黄花一百担。川西代川南销桔糖二千担、茶叶一千五百担、桂元三百担及笋干、芋片、白瓜子、冬菜、芽菜等各一部；川西代川北销直缫丝五十万两、土布三万匹、白木耳、黑木耳各一部。贵州代川西销灵宝大枣五千斤，代川南销雨伞五千把、篦子一万把、大曲酒一百担。
    又，西南财政经济委员会颁布自本月二十一日起，降低三十三种土产品的轮船运费后，土产商反映良好，渝市药材市场已显活跃。过去因运费过高而无人经管的本区药材，如黄姜、白姜、陈皮、巴豆等，现已有不少人在市场开始收购。证明土产品的轮船运费的降低，刺激着西南土产外销，而黄姜、白姜、陈皮、巴豆等的开始外销事实，又证明降低运费不但不会减少轮船公司的收入，反而会从货运增加上获得新的收益。
    编者按：通过合同制组织土产、特产内销，是扩大土产、特产销路的好办法。西南区在扩大外销的同时，组织内销的作法是很必要的。除省、区间组织交换外，还应在一省范围内组织县与县，在一县范围内组织区与区以至村、镇之间的交换。通过广泛的交换，构成纵横交错的商业关系，便能彻底打开土产、特产的销路。
