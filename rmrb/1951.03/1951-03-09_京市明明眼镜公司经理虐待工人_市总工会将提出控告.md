　　Beijing Mingming Glasses Company Manager Abuses Workers
    Municipal Trade Union Federation to File Charges

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published a letter from a reader on January 28th exposing the abuse of workers by Du Zechen, manager of the Mingming Glasses Company, the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Federation conducted further investigation into the matter, revealing more of Du Zechen's crimes, and will file charges according to the law. The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Federation is completely correct in doing so to protect the legitimate rights of workers. This shows that if the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit is not followed, and workers are treated with oppression, it is not permitted by law.

To the Editor:
    The following is a report on the circumstances of Du Zechen, manager of the Beijing Mingming Glasses Company, beating and persecuting workers, using benefits to entice workers not to join the trade union, slandering the trade union, and disregarding government decrees:

    Before liberation, Du Zechen consistently abused workers. Those who worked in his company often left after less than a year due to the unbearable abuse. After liberation, Du Zechen still did not change this brutal behavior. In October 1949, he severely beat apprentice Dong Xuezhong again. At that time, worker Li Jiping could not tolerate his class brother being abused by Du Zechen and demanded that Du Zechen, along with Dong Xuezhong and Ma Shizhi: (1) refrain from beating and scolding workers in the future; (2) reasonably adjust wages. Du Zechen not only did not accept these reasonable demands from the workers but also forced Dong Xuezhong and Ma Shizhi to write "confessions," and cunningly deceived the workers. On October 18th, Du Zechen colluded with Li Zhongsan, manager of the Tongletang Pharmacy, and Zhao Xinbo, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, to come to the Mingming Glasses Company to mediate the matter for him. Du took out 20,000 yuan, saying it was to increase Li Jiping's salary, and tricked Li Jiping into making a "ten" mark on a pre-prepared illegal document. The content of the document stated that "Li Jiping is a temporary worker and can be dismissed at any time" (in fact, Li Jiping had been working at the Mingming Glasses Company since January 1948 and was certainly not a temporary worker). From then on, Du's feudal rule over the workers became even more intensified, such as: prohibiting workers from talking to each other; restricting workers' time for urination and defecation; and locking the apprentices' sleeping rooms from the outside at night. When the trade union was developing members in the industry, Du Zechen carried out sabotage and enticement, proposing that anyone who did not join the trade union would receive an additional 80,000 yuan per month.

    In July 1950, during the citywide household registration census, Li Jiping's household registration had been privately canceled by Du Zechen when he had previously taken leave to go home. Li Jiping requested Du Zechen to re-register him. Du Zechen not only refused to register him but also spread rumors to intimidate Li Jiping, saying, "Registering will require everyone to buy 30 shares of public bonds, and you young people won't be able to escape conscription in the future." After several urgings from the Public Security Bureau, Du still refused to register, and the Public Security Sub-bureau detained Du Zechen at the police station for education. After being released, Du Zechen not only did not repent but retaliated against Li Jiping, abruptly firing Li Jiping on August 7th without any reason, and stopping his food and wages.

    After the Second District Office of the Municipal Trade Union Federation learned of this matter, they believed that Li's dismissal was unreasonable and decided to negotiate with Du Zechen to resolve the matter. They contacted him fourteen times, but Du consistently avoided meeting them. Du Zechen wrote two letters to the Second District Trade Union Office, in which he slandered the trade union cadres' talks with workers as "disrupting business" and "instigating labor-capital disputes," and expressed his determination to "fight the trade union to the end, regardless of any sacrifice," fully revealing his illegal behavior of despising trade union organizations and resisting the Trade Union Law. (Note: Article 22 of the Trade Union Law stipulates: "...When dismissing workers or staff, the list of proposed dismissals and the reasons must be notified to the grassroots trade union committee ten days in advance. If the grassroots trade union committee finds that such dismissal violates the decrees of the People's Government or the collective contract, it has the right to protest within seven days...") Li Jiping had no choice but to request arbitration from the Municipal Labor Bureau and later appealed to the Supreme People's Court. After thoroughly understanding the situation, the Supreme People's Court ruled on November 22nd of last year: (1) Li Jiping shall be reinstated immediately, and the labor-capital parties shall jointly formulate a labor-capital mutual benefit contract with the local trade union; (2) The workers of the Mingming Glasses Company have the right to join the trade union according to law, and manager Du Zechen shall not interfere; (3) Li Jiping shall, in accordance with the labor-capital mutual benefit policy, fulfill the contract and diligently study his profession to improve production; (4) The economic losses suffered by Li Jiping during the period of illegal dismissal by Du Zechen shall be compensated by the Mingming Glasses Company. When Li Jiping went to the Mingming Glasses Company for reinstatement in accordance with the judgment, Du Zechen firmly refused to implement the judgment of the Supreme People's Court. Du's daughter even mocked Li Jiping, saying, "Such a big lad can't find food elsewhere, why are you赖 (lai - loafing/depending on someone)? If it were me, I'd rather die!" On December 17th, Du Zechen's son, Du Baojun, even splashed acid on Li Jiping's back in an attempt to murder him. Afterward, Du Baojun falsely claimed that Li Jiping "attempted suicide to disrupt business." By December 24th, Du Zechen, under the pretext of internal cleaning, suspended business and refused Li Jiping entry. The负责人 (fuzeren - person in charge) of the Municipal Trade Union Federation and the district office also approached Du Zechen five or six times to reason with him, but Du still avoided meeting them. Finally, under the compulsion of the court, Du Zechen allowed Li Jiping to return to work at the Mingming Glasses Company. However, up to now, Du Zechen still owes Li Jiping more than seven months' wages, and the vast majority has been delayed in payment. As a result, Li Jiping's family is now facing great financial difficulties.

    After the Supreme People's Court ruled that Li Jiping should be reinstated, Du Zechen spread the word everywhere that he would resolutely not recognize the judgment of the Supreme People's Court, and at the same time instructed friends to entice Li Jiping with money, in an attempt to achieve his goal of dismissing Li Jiping and undermining the fair judgment of the Supreme People's Court. However, Li Jiping rejected all of them, and Du's conspiracy did not succeed.

    The Municipal Trade Union Federation believes that manager Du Zechen's series of behaviors of abusing workers, obstructing workers from joining the trade union, illegally dismissing workers, and slandering the trade union have seriously violated the government's policies and decrees. Du Zechen's actions are rare illegal acts among the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing after liberation. Many industrialists and businessmen have also expressed dissatisfaction with this. The trade union will soon file a report and accusation with the government's judicial organs on behalf of the workers to protect workers' rights and interests and safeguard the dignity of the law.

### 京市明明眼镜公司经理虐待工人  市总工会将提出控告

　　京市明明眼镜公司经理虐待工人
    市总工会将提出控告
    编者按：本报一月二十八日发表读者揭露明明眼镜公司经理杜泽臣虐待工人的来信后，北京市总工会对此事作了进一步的调查，揭露出杜泽臣更多的罪行，并将依法提出控告。北京市总工会为保障工人正当权利，这样作是完全对的。这说明如果不按照劳资两利的政策办事，用压迫手段对待工人，是法律所不允许的。编辑同志：
    兹将京市明明眼镜公司经理杜泽臣打骂与迫害工人、利诱工人不要参加工会、诬蔑工会和无视政府法令的情形报告如下：
    杜泽臣在解放前一贯虐待工人。在他公司里干活的人，因不堪虐待，经常不满一年便离职他去。解放后，杜泽臣仍不改变这种蛮横行为。在一九四九年十月间，杜又毒打学徒董学忠。当时工人李际平不能容忍自己的阶级弟兄受杜泽臣的虐待，便和董学忠、马士志要求杜泽臣：（一）今后不能再打骂工人；（二）合理调整工资。杜泽臣不但不接纳工人这些合理的要求，反而强迫董学忠、马士志写“悔过书”，并狡猾地欺骗工人。十月十八日，杜泽臣拉拢同乐堂药铺经理李仲三、中医赵心波等至明明眼镜公司为他和解此事，由杜拿出二万元，说是给李际平加工资，并将预先拟就的非法字据，欺蒙李际平在上面画“十”字。字据的内容是说“李际平是临时工，可以随时解雇”（实际上李际平自一九四八年一月便至明明眼镜公司工作，当然不是临时工）。从此以后，杜对工人的封建统治更变本加厉，如：不许工人在一起谈话；限制工人大小便时间；晚上并把学徒们睡觉的房间在外边反锁等。工会在该行业发展会员时，杜泽臣进行破坏、利诱，提出谁不参加工会，可每月增加工资八万元。
    一九五○年七月全市普查户口，李际平因前请假回家时户口被杜泽臣私自撤销了，要求杜泽臣重新给他报户口。杜泽臣不但不给报户口，还造谣恐吓李际平说：“报了户口每人要买三十分公债，将来抓兵，你们青年人也跑不了。”后经公安局几次催促，杜仍不报，公安分局始将杜泽臣拘留至派出所教育。杜泽臣被释后不但不知悔改，反对李际平进行报复，突于八月七日无故将李际平解雇，停止了李的伙食与工资。
    市总工会第二区办事处得知此事后，认为李被解雇不合理，决定与杜泽臣协商解决此事，先后找他十四次，但杜始终避不见面，杜泽臣写了两封信给二区工会办事处，信中诬蔑工会干部找工人谈话为“扰乱营业”，“教唆挑拨劳资纠纷”，并表示誓与工会“破釜沉舟搞下去，任何牺牲在所不惜”，充分表露着他蔑视工会组织，抵抗工会法的违法行为。（按：工会法第二十二条规定：“……解雇工人或职员时，应将拟解雇人之名单与理由，于十日前通知工会基层委员会。如工会基层委员会发现此种解雇有违反人民政府法令或集体合同情事时，有权于七日内提出抗议。……”）李际平只好请求市劳动局仲裁，后并上诉至最高人民法院。最高人民法院经切实了解情况后，于去年十一月二十二日判决：（一）李际平即日复工，由劳资双方会同当地工会共同订立劳资两利合同；（二）明明眼镜公司的工人，依法有参加工会的权利，经理杜泽臣不得干涉；（三）李际平应本劳资两利政策，履行合同，精研业务，以提高生产；（四）李际平在被杜泽臣非法解雇期间经济上的损失，应由明明眼镜公司负责偿还。当李际平遵照判决至明明眼镜公司复工时，杜泽臣竟对最高人民法院的判决坚决拒不执行。杜的女儿还嘲笑李际平说：“这么大的小伙子那儿吃不了饭，干吗，在这里赖？要是我还不如死了好！”十二月十七日，杜泽臣的儿子杜宝钧竟用镪水洒在李际平的背上，企图谋杀他。事后杜宝钧反扬言说李际平“企图自杀扰乱营业”。至十二月二十四日，杜泽臣又借口清理内部，暂停营业，拒绝李际平进门。市总工会及区办事处的负责人又前后五、六次找杜泽臣讲理，杜还是避不见面。最后在法院的强制下，杜泽臣才让李际平至明明眼镜公司复工。但到现在为止，杜泽臣欠李际平七个多月的工资，绝大部分仍拖延不发。以致李际平现在家庭生活非常困难。
    在最高人民法院判决李际平复工后，杜泽臣到处扬言坚决不承认最高人民法院的判决，同时并指使友人诱买李际平，以企图达到其解雇李际平、破坏最高人民法院的公正判决的目的。但李际平皆一一加以拒绝，杜的阴谋才没有实现。
    市总工会认为明明眼镜公司经理杜泽臣这一连串虐待工人、阻挠工人参加工会、非法解雇工人、诬蔑工会的行为，已经严重地违反了政府的政策法令。杜泽臣的所作所为，是解放后北京市工商界中少有的犯法行为。许多工商业者也对此表示不满。工会即将代表工人向政府司法机关对此提出检举、控告，以保障工人权益，保障法律尊严。
