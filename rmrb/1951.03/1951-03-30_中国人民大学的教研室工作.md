The Teaching and Research Office Work of Renmin University of China
	Cheng Fangwu, Vice President of Renmin University of China

	The teaching and research office is the basic organization for teaching and research work at Renmin University of China. It directly conducts teaching methods and scientific research work for one or several closely related disciplines.

	This organization brings together teachers who teach one or several similar courses to jointly conduct teaching and research work.

	In old-style universities, each teacher usually lectured to students based on his personal understanding of the courses he taught, and even based on his personal interests. This was once considered reasonable. If someone made suggestions to a university professor about the content or method of lecturing, he would consider it a deliberate insult and an infringement of his freedom. He could bear no responsibility for students' learning. This teaching method and attitude, on the one hand, could not guarantee the ideological and scientific nature of the teaching content, but was very convenient for reactionaries to spread erroneous, and even reactionary, poisons. On the other hand, it inevitably fostered the looseness, individualism, and anarchism of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals.

	To build a new country, we must train new cadres, have new-style higher education institutions, and have new-style teaching organizations. This organization should not be built on the basis of individualism, but should be collective. The requirements of new higher education are multifaceted. Only by fully realizing the cooperation of educational workers and giving full play to the strength of the collective can we meet objective needs. "When laborers work together with others according to plan, they break their personal limitations and unfold human abilities." (Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 11) "Cooperation not only increases the productivity of the individual, but also creates a new productive force, namely collective force." (Ibid.) These principles also apply here. Only such an organization can not only guarantee the realization of the arduous tasks of new higher education from the organizational level, but also continuously improve the educational workers themselves.

	The advanced educational science of the Soviet Union created a set of such organizations, a complete institution, which we translate as "teaching and research office." It organizes teachers according to courses to directly carry out related teaching and research work. These tasks can be roughly divided into the following aspects:

		1. Organize the teaching work of the teaching and research office staff (lectures, seminars, internships, experiments, tutoring, production internships, etc.) and ensure the quality of teaching.
		2. Work on teaching methods (formulating lecture outlines, seminar plans, experiment plans, exercise and answer collections, etc.).
		3. Compiling teaching materials (lecture notes, reference books, charts, etc.).
		4. Scientific research work (special scientific research).
		5. Collaboration with enterprises and government agencies.
		6. Work to improve the ideological and theoretical level of teachers.
		7. Work to train graduate students.

	The personnel and organization of the teaching and research office are roughly as follows:

		Director (the main teacher of the teaching and research office)
		All teachers in the teaching and research office
		Translator
		Secretary, staff and other administrative personnel
		Graduate students
		Reference room (reference room director, several librarians)
		Laboratory
		Permanent or temporary committees (such as the teaching method committee, outline committee, editorial committee, etc.)

	Renmin University of China now has forty-one teaching and research offices. In addition to the seven school-wide common course teaching and research offices (such as the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office, the Chinese Revolution Theory Teaching and Research Office, etc.) which are led by the Academic Affairs Department, the rest are led by the respective departments. The directors of the teaching and research offices are appointed by the president upon the recommendation of the department heads. The teaching and research offices have a fixed format work plan. The work plan of each teaching and research office must be approved by the teaching and research office meeting at the beginning of each semester, signed and approved by the department head, and then submitted to the president for approval. The "Teaching and Research Office Work Plan" has clear provisions for each specific task (such as the executor and completion date of a certain task) and necessary explanations (such as the number of words and the number of copies to be published for compiling teaching materials).

	The "Teaching and Research Office Work Plan" includes the following main items:

	1. Teaching and Research Office Meeting Schedule (including three columns: issues to be discussed, the name of the speaker and the date). --The main issues to be discussed each semester, such as the work plan for this semester, the review of lecture notes and lecture outlines, the inspection of teaching progress and effectiveness, the research on teaching methods, the opinions of the director of the teaching and research office after listening to the teachers' lectures, the graduate students' study plan and study inspection, the scientific research plan inspection, the review of scientific papers, the information work, the textbook publication plan, the preparation for examinations, the summary of the semester or academic year work, and the preparation for the next semester work, etc. Each issue has a scheduled reporter and date.
	2. Teachers' reports at the teaching and research office meetings (divided into three columns: report content, name of the reporter, and date). --Such as teachers' teaching experience or summary of a certain course. Reports on internships or tutoring, opinions after mutual class observations, progress of research work, reports on the completion of teachers' personal work plans.
	3. Teaching method work (divided into three columns: project, executor and completion deadline). --Such as compiling the lecture outline of a certain course, the internship question plan for a certain class, trial lectures, mutual class observations, research on teaching methods, and the preparation of examination questions.
	4. Work on compiling teaching materials and charts (divided into four columns: project, executor, teaching and research office discussion deadline, and first draft completion deadline). --Such as the compilation of lecture notes and reference materials for a certain course, the compilation of several kinds of charts, and the translation of teaching materials.
	5. Scientific research work plan (divided into three columns: topic, executor and completion deadline). --Each teaching and research office member's scientific research work plan for this semester. If possible, student scientific research groups can be organized, and the teaching and research office will assign teachers to guide them separately.
	6. Work to improve the scientific level and political and ideological level of teachers (divided into three columns: project, executor and completion deadline). --Such as teachers jointly studying a certain specialized work, research and commentary on relevant books and newspapers, study of Marxism-Leninism, current affairs study, etc.
	7. Contact and collaboration between the teaching and research office and enterprises or government agencies. --Such as sending people to participate in regular or temporary meetings of relevant government departments, participating in or assisting in certain aspects of the work of a certain enterprise according to the contract, and collaborating with a certain department outside the school on scientific research.
	8. Work to train graduate students. --Formulation of graduate student study plans, guidance and inspection of graduate student studies, ideological education of graduate students, examination and evaluation of graduate students.

	These are the main contents of the collective activities or general plan of the teaching and research office. The teaching and research office carries out its work in an orderly manner according to such a plan (each teacher has a "teacher work plan" in a fixed format).

	The director of the teaching and research office organizes and leads the collective activities of the entire teaching and research office according to such a plan, and supervises and helps the specific work of each member. He must formulate the lecture content of the courses taught by the teaching and research office according to the overall education plan, the number, time and progress of lectures and seminars, and check the content and method of lectures and seminars, point out the advantages and disadvantages, and help improve them. To this end, he must often observe the lectures and seminars of the members of the teaching and research office (more than 30 hours per semester). He must formulate the meeting schedule of the teaching and research office at the beginning of each semester and stipulate the reports of certain teachers at the meeting. The outlines, internship plans, teaching materials and charts that the teaching and research office should make are all assigned to certain teachers by him. And be responsible for review, or organize review. He must organize teachers to tutor students according to the prescribed schedule, lead students' self-study work, and check their grades. In addition to these and other teaching tasks, he must always pay attention to the improvement of teachers' scientific quality and ideological level, and provide various assistance. To this end, he must lead and supervise the scientific research work of teachers, organize them to study Marxism-Leninism and study current affairs, and help them connect with reality. In order to train scientific education cadres, he must be responsible for leading the education of graduate students and regularly check the implementation of graduate student study plans.

	Renmin University of China, based on Soviet experience and under the direct guidance and assistance of Soviet professors, has launched the work of the teaching and research office, and has achieved great results in the past year. In terms of teaching work, the teaching and research office has carried out its work in a planned and organized manner. Completed the teaching tasks, achieved a certain teaching quality, and the students have gained a lot. In terms of scientific research work, the work of special research has been universally started since last September, and the foundation for research work has also been laid. More importantly, it has trained and improved nearly 300 teachers, enabling these mostly young educators to achieve significant achievements in a very short period of time. More than 400 graduate students and visiting researchers have also gained satisfactory results. Each teaching and research office has shown a spirit of hard work and good labor discipline.

	Our experience over the past year has proved that the organization of the teaching and research office is a powerful weapon for new-style higher education. It enables us to give full play to the power of the collective and complete very difficult tasks. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the work of the teaching and research office of Renmin University of China, but these are ultimately caused by the difficulties in our manpower and material resources, and definitely not by any defects in such an organization, which can be asserted. When we inspected the work of the teaching and research office in the first semester, some teachers said that they did not expect us to exert such great strength. Higher education in the new China must universally adopt such a new organization to serve national construction with new work quality.

　　中国人民大学的教研室工作
    中国人民大学副校长  成仿吾
    教研室是中国人民大学的教学与研究工作的基本组织，直接进行一门或数门有密切联系的学科的教学方法的与科学研究的工作。
    这个组织把担任一门或几门同种类的课程的教师们组织起来，共同进行教学与研究工作。
    在旧式的大学，通常每个教师根据他个人对于所担任课程的理解，甚至根据他个人的兴趣向学生们讲课。这曾经被认为是合理的。如果有人对一个大学教授提出关于讲课内容或方法的意见，他会认为是故意侮辱他，侵犯他的自由。他对于学生的学习是可以不负任何责任的。这种教学方法与态度，一方面对于教学内容的思想性与科学性无法保证，而对于反动派传播错误的，甚至反动的毒素，倒是非常便利，另一方面，又必然助长资产阶级与小资产阶级知识分子的散漫，个人主义与无政府主义。
    建设新的国家要培养新的干部，要有新式的高等教育机关，要有新式的教学组织。这个组织不能够建立在个人主义的基础上，而应该是集体的。新的高等教育的要求是多方面的，只有充分实现教育工作人员的合作，高度发挥集体的力量，才能够满足客观的需要。“当劳动者依计划与他人共同工作时，他把个人的限制打破了，把人类的能力展开了。”（资本论第一卷第十一章）“合作不仅提高了个人的生产力，并且创造了一种新的生产力，即集体力。”（同前）这些道理在这里也是适用的。只有这样的组织才能够不单从组织上保证实现新的高等教育的繁重的任务，而且能够不断提高教育工作者本身。
    苏联先进的教育科学创造了一套这样的组织，一个完整的机构，我们把他翻译为教研室。他把教师们按课程组织起来直接进行有关的教学与研究工作。这些工作大体上可分为以下几方面：
        １、组织教研室工作人员的教学工作（讲课，习明纳尔，实习，实验
    ，辅导，生产实习等）并保证教学质量。
        ２、教学方法上的工作（制订讲授大纲，习明纳尔计划，实验计划，
    习题和答案选集等）。
        ３、编写教材（讲义，参考书，图表等）。
        ４、科学研究工作（专题科学研究）。
        ５、与企业和政府机关的协作。
        ６、提高教师思想理论水平的工作。
        ７、培养研究生的工作。
    教研室的人员与机构大致如下：
        主任（该教研室主要教师）
        教研室全体教师
        翻译
        秘书，干事和其他行政人员
        研究生
        资料室（资料室主任，资料员若干名）
        实验室
        经常的或临时的委员会（如教学方法委员会，提纲委员会，编审委员会等）
    中国人民大学现在共有四十一个教研室，除全校性的共同课教研室（如马克思列宁主义教研室，中国革命理论教研室等七个）由教务部领导外，其余分别由各系领导，教研室主任由系主任呈请校长委任。教研室有一定格式的工作计划。每一个教研室的工作计划须于每学期初经教研室会议通过，经系主任签字同意后请校长批准。《教研室工作计划》对每一项具体工作都有明确的规定（如某项工作的执行者及完成日期）与必要的说明（如编写教材的字数与出版份数等）。
    《教研室工作计划》包括以下的主要项目：
    １、教研室会议日程表（包括要讨论的问题，报告者姓名与日期三栏）。——每一学期须讨论的主要问题，如本学期工作计划，讲义与讲授大纲的审查，教学进度与效果检查，教学方法研究，教研室主任听教员讲课后的意见，研究生学习计划与学习检查，科学研究计划检查，审查科学论文，资料工作，教材出版计划，考试准备工作，学期或学年工作总结，下学期工作准备等，每一问题都有预定报告人及日期。
    ２、教师们在教研室会议上的报告（分报告内容，报告者姓名与日期三栏）。——如教师关于某一课程的教学经验或总结。关于实习或辅导的报告，互相听课后的意见，研究工作的进行情况，教师个人工作计划完成情形的报告。
    ３、教学方法的工作（分项目，执行人与完成期限三栏）。——如编制某一课程的讲授大纲，某班的实习题计划，试讲，互相旁听，关于教学方法的研究，考试题目的编制。
    ４、编写教材及图表的工作（分项目，执行人，教研室讨论期限与初稿完成期限四栏）。——如某一课程的讲义，参考资料的编订，图表若干种的编制，教材的翻译。
    ５、科学研究工作计划（分题目，执行人与完成期限三栏）。——教研室成员每人本学期的科学研究工作计划。可能时并可组织学生的科学研究小组，教研室派教师分别指导。
    ６、教师的科学水平与政治思想水平提高的工作（分项目，执行人与完成期限三栏）。——如教师共同研究某种专门著作，有关书报的研究与评论，马克思列宁主义学习，时事学习等。
    ７、教研室与企业或政府机关的联系与协作。——如派人参加有关政府部门的定期或临时的会议，按合同参加或帮助某一企业的某方面的工作，与校外某一部门的科学研究上的协作。
    ８、培养研究生的工作。——研究生学习计划的制订，研究生学习的指导与检查，研究生的思想教育，研究生的考试与鉴定。
    这些就是教研室的集体活动或总的计划的主要内容，教研室就是按照这样的计划有秩序地进行工作的（每个教师另有一定格式的“教师工作计划”）。
    教研室主任根据这样的计划组织与领导全教研室的集体活动，并督促与帮助每个成员的具体工作。他要根据总的教育计划订出教研室所任课程的讲授内容，讲课与习明纳尔的次数、时数和进度，并检查讲课与习明纳尔的内容和方法，指出优缺点，帮助改进。为此，他要经常旁听教研室成员的讲课与习明纳尔（每学期三○小时以上）。他要在每学期初订出教研室会议日程，规定某些教师在会议上的报告。教研室应做的提纲，实习计划，教材图表等都经他分配给某些教师。并负责审查，或组织审阅。他要组织教员按规定的进度表对学生进行辅导，领导学生的自习工作，并检查其成绩。除这些及其他教学工作外，他要经常注意教师在科学质量与思想水平方面的提高，并给予各种协助。为此，他要领导与督促教师们的科学研究工作，组织他们学习马克思列宁主义与研究时事，并帮助他们与实际联系。为了培养科学教育干部，他要负责领导研究生的教育，定期检查研究生学习计划的执行情形。
    中国人民大学根据苏联经验，并在苏联教授们直接指导与帮助下，展开了教研室的工作，一年以来已经得到了很大的成绩。在教学工作方面，教研室有计划有组织地进行了工作。完成了教学任务，达到了一定的教学质量，学生的收获很大。在科学研究工作方面，从去年九月以来普遍开始了专题研究的工作，也已经打下了研究工作的基础。更重要的是，培养与提高了近三百个教师，使这些绝大部分年青的教育工作者在很短的时期内得到了重大的成就。四百多个研究生与外来研究人员也有了满意的收获。每个教研室都表现了刻苦钻研的精神与良好的劳动纪律。
    我们一年来的体验证明了。教研室这样的组织是新式高等教育的强有力的武器。他使我们能够发挥高度的集体的力量，完成非常困难的任务。中国人民大学的教研室工作中当然也还存在着许多的缺点，但这些归根到底只是我们人力物力方面的困难造成的，而决不是这样的组织有什么缺陷，这是可以断言的。当我们检查第一学期的教研室工作的时候，有的教师曾经说，没想到我们能发出这样大的力量。新中国的高等教育须要普遍地采用这样的新的组织，以新的工作质量为国家建设服务。
