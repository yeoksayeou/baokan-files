    Our Great Motherland
    Technical workers at the Qingdao Municipal Farm and Forestry Office orchard are pruning peach trees. The peaches produced by these trees are as sweet as honey and are commonly known as "honey peaches," a famous product of Qingdao. Pruning after the Spring Festival each year can increase production. Last year, the average yield per peach tree was sixty jin of peaches.
