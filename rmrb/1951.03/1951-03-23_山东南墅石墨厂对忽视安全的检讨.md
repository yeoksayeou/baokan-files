Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

To the Editor:

　　Regarding the criticism from Comrade Ju Shishui published in your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column on February 16th, concerning our factory's neglect of safety education, which resulted in serious casualties, we now offer the following self-criticism:

　　(1) The main reason for the casualties was that leading cadres held a purely task-oriented view, neglected employee safety protection, and were very untimely in addressing safety facilities. This is a concrete manifestation of our lack of a mass viewpoint. The leading cadres should bear the primary responsibility for this accident and have voluntarily requested appropriate punishment from the higher authorities.

　　(2) Relevant personnel did not conduct thorough inspections of machinery and equipment. The guide wheel of the conveyor belt became covered with mineral sand, and its diameter increased after freezing. The inspectors failed to detect this in time, thereby preventing a dangerous accident. This shows that our work is very careless and deserves a deep self-criticism.

　　(3) The Tan Fenglin team, where the accident occurred, had recently been experiencing disunity. Instead of taking positive steps such as conducting education and resolving ideological issues, we took the passive approach of transferring their work. Furthermore, the transfer of workers was not formally discussed in a meeting, and we did not adequately consider the potential ideological problems that might arise among the workers after the transfer. As a result, the transferred workers were unsettled, and the accident occurred that same evening. This shows that there are problems with our leadership methods.

　　(4) Cadres at all levels have not done enough to educate employees about safety precautions. Higher-level instructions and circulars regarding safety precautions are rarely taken out for a specific period of time to organize employee study; they are only mentioned in passing during other meetings, so the effect is not great. In the future, we should learn from these lessons, correct our shortcomings, and strive to improve the people's enterprise.

### 山东南墅石墨厂对忽视安全的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　山东南墅石墨厂对忽视安全的检讨编辑同志：
    贵报二月十六日《读者来信》栏刊登鞠世绥同志对我厂忽视安全教育，造成严重伤亡事故的批评。现在我们检讨如下：
    （一）造成伤亡事故的原因，主要是由于领导干部存在着单纯任务观点，忽视职工的安全保护，对安全设施的处理很不及时。这是我们缺乏群众观点的具体表现。这次事故的发生，领导干部应负主要责任，已自请上级给予应得处分。
    （二）有关人员对机器设备检查不深入。运输带的诱导轮沾上矿砂，冻冰后诱导轮的直径加大了。检查人员竟不能及时发觉，从而防止危险事故的发生。这说明了我们的工作十分粗枝大叶，应该深刻检讨。
    （三）发生事故的谭凤林小组，最近常闹不团结。我们不从进行教育、打通思想等积极方面着手，而是消极地以调动他们的工作来解决。在调动工人时又没有经过正式会议研究，没有足够地估计到调动后工人中可能产生的思想问题。以致调动后工人不安心，当天晚上就发生事故。这说明我们领导方法有问题。
    （四）各级干部对职工有关安全防险的教育做得不够。上级有关防险的指示及通令等，很少拿出一定时间，组织职工学习；只是在开别的会议时，捎带地给讲一下，所以效果不大。今后我们应该接受这些教训，改正缺点，努力搞好人民企业。
                                                        南墅石墨厂
