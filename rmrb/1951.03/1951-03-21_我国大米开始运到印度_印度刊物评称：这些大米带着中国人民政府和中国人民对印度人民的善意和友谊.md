Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th. As the Indian people are suffering from a severe food shortage, the first and second batches of rice shipped from China to India under the barter contract signed with India arrived in Calcutta on February 19th and 27th, totaling 13,100 tons. The third batch of rice is scheduled to arrive at Madras Port within days. The Sino-Indian barter contract stipulates that China agrees to exchange 50,000 tons of rice for 16,500 bales of jute bags from India.

This barter is the first trade between New China and India. Yao Zhongkang, China's Consul General in Calcutta, held a reception on the evening of February 21st to celebrate. Two hundred prominent figures from Calcutta were invited, including senior officials of the West Bengal province of India, prominent figures in the business community, professors, writers, artists, and journalists.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th. The Indian weekly "Nayi Raushni" published in Lucknow commented on March 5th on the shipment of Chinese rice to India. The weekly wrote: The first ship carrying rice from People's China has arrived in India. This ship from New China not only brought rice to the Indian people, but also, through this rice, brought the goodwill and friendship of the Chinese government and the Chinese people towards the Indian people. Before negotiating with China, India began negotiations with the United States on the grain issue. However, we have now received rice from China. And even those who support the United States do not believe that American wheat can be shipped to India before November or December 1951. This clearly shows whether China or the United States truly cares about the Indian people.

The publication continued: The rice from China also draws people's attention to another thing: How could China, which has suffered from disasters and famine, have undergone such a great change in just one year? How can it not only not need foreign grain, but also be able to export grain? The reason why China can solve its food problem is mainly due to land reform, which liberated farmers from feudal exploitation and guided them towards the road to prosperity.

    我国大米开始运到印度
    印度刊物评称：这些大米带着中国人民政府和中国人民对印度人民的善意和友谊
    【新华社新德里二十日电】正当印度人民遭受严重的粮荒之际，我国根据与印度签订的换货合同运到印度的大米，第一、第二两批已于二月十九日和二十七日运抵加尔各答，共计一万三千一百吨。第三批大米亦定于日内运抵马德拉斯港。中印间的该项换货合同规定：中国同意印度以麻袋一万六千五百包交换中国的大米五万吨。
    这次换货是新中国和印度之间的第一批贸易。我国驻加尔各答总领事姚仲康特于二月二十一日晚举行酒会，表示庆祝。应邀到会的有加尔各答著名人士二百人，其中包括印度西孟加拉省的高级官员、商界著名人士、教授、作家、艺术家和新闻记者等。
    【新华社新德里二十日电】在勒克瑙出版的印文周刊《新黎明》于三月五日对中国大米运到印度一事发表评论。该周刊写道：从人民中国运大米来的第一只船已经到了印度。这只从新中国来的船，不仅给印度人民带来了大米，而且通过这些大米，还带来了中国政府和中国人民对印度人民的善意和友谊。印度在与中国进行谈判之前，就和美国开始了关于粮食问题的谈判。但是，我们现在却已经接到了来自中国的大米。而美国的小麦呢，甚至连支持美国的人们也不相信美国小麦能在一九五一年十一月至十二月以前运到印度。这就十分清楚地说明了，倒底是中国还是美国真正关怀印度人民。
    该刊继称：来自中国的大米使人们还注意到另外一件事情：饱经灾荒和饥馑的中国，怎样能在一年之内就起了这样大的变化？怎样能不但不需外粮，而且还能够向外输出粮食？中国之所以能够解决它的粮食问题，主要应归功于土地改革，土地改革把农民从封建剥削之下解放出来，并引导他们向繁荣的大道迈进。
