　　Readers and Editors
    Starting from this issue, this publication will open this small column to broadly reflect and discuss specific issues in the publishing and writing community. The opinions expressed here, although from the editors, mainly come from the readers. This format is intended to reflect readers' opinions more promptly and sensitively; therefore, we hope readers will raise more questions.

  Starting with a Valuable Little Book
    "Imperialist Investment in China" written by Mr. Wei Zichu, published by People's Publishing House in early January this year, is a small book, but it is a very good book. The editor's note states: "This book is a summary report on the study of foreign investment in China." This book indeed concisely accomplished its task and systematically solved a problem we should study.
    The advantages of this book are: concise and rich data, concise and organized writing, and clear and correct viewpoints. From this small book, readers can understand the trend and characteristics of imperialist investment in China over half a century, the proportion of foreign capital in our country's economy, and the new changes after liberation. Whether in terms of citing materials, organizing materials, or explaining materials, the author fully utilized a rigorous and meticulous spirit and seriously completed his writing work. This kind of detailed research and excavation of original materials from all aspects of Chinese economic history is a valuable labor.
  One Book Becomes Two Books
    "The Relationship Between Soviet Cities and Villages" translated by Mr. Pan Gongzhao and published by Zhongwai Publishing House in September 1949, and "How the Soviet Union Overcomes the Relationship Between Cities and Villages" translated by Mr. Pan Lang and published by Zhonghua Book Company in January 1950, are identical in content except for the different titles and the different transliterations of the original author's name as "Kexiliefu" and "Keshlifu." According to readers, it seems likely that Mr. Pan Lang or Mr. Pan Gongzhao republished the translated manuscript, thus creating a "one book, two prints" situation. Readers have the right to question such things.
    "Book Review" (the predecessor of this publication) published a reader's accusation against the "one book, two prints" situation of "Chinese Narrative Poetry" and "Chunyun Divorce" in its ninth issue. Recently, Comrade Wang Yaping has made a review and explanation in the 32nd issue of "Wenyi Bao." Regarding the process of the repeated publication of the above two small books, we also hope that Mr. Pan Gongzhao and Mr. Pan Lang will explain it to the readers.
    Our opinion is: one book with multiple prints is a waste in production, and this rare phenomenon should be eliminated. The main purpose of reflecting this matter is this.
  Another "Two Books with Similar Content"
    Mr. Chen Shouqi from Shanxi University in Taiyuan sent us a manuscript titled: "Two Books with Similar Content." He pointed out that: 1. "Post-War Economic Doctrines" written by Mr. Li Zhengwen and published by Sanlian Bookstore in March 1950, and 2. "The General Crisis of Capitalism and Bourgeois Political Economy" written by Trakhtenberg, translated by Mr. Li Shaofu, and published by Zhonghua Book Company in November 1949, although one is a writing and the other is a translation, the "content is almost exactly the same." Therefore, he judged that "Mr. Li Zhengwen's work must be a translation."
    The manuscript states: "Comparing Mr. Li Zhengwen's work with Mr. Li Shaofu's translation, there are some differences: Mr. Li Zhengwen added a small introduction at the beginning of the text and a sentence at the end. There are also some additions in the text. In addition, a small title is added before each section, and it is added very appropriately. The writing is also much smoother than Mr. Li's translation." In this case, it would be more in line with the facts and a better approach to publish it with the word "compiled" and an explanation.
    "Post-War Economic Doctrines" was originally a special article, possibly published in progressive publications in the Kuomintang reactionary ruling area before liberation. The text still retains some traces of avoiding the reactionary派's censorship, such as quoting Stalin's words on page three using "a great man in Europe once said," and even translating Stalin's name into "Yao Xifu" (a variant transliteration of Joseph, see page 65). However, it is a ridiculous oversight to keep these traces in a book published in March 1950.
    Until today, carefully reviewing past publications and reprints and doing all necessary revisions is still an important task that writers and publishers should work together to do well.

专栏：

　　读者·编者
    本刊从这一期起增辟这一小栏，来广泛反映、讨论出版物和著作界中的一些具体问题。发表在这里的，虽然是编者的意见，但这些意见主要是从读者中来的。采取这样的形式，是打算更及时和更敏锐地反映读者的意见；因此，希望读者们多多提出问题。
          编者
  一本有价值的小书说起
    魏子初先生著、人民出版社本年一月初版的《帝国主义在华投资》是一本小书，然而是一本很好的小书。编者说明：“本书是研究外人在华投资的一个提要性的报告”，这本书确实很扼要地达成了它的任务，系统地解决了我们所应该研究的一个问题。
    这本书的好处是：资料扼要丰富，文字精简有条理，观点清晰正确。读者从这一本小书里面，可以了解半世纪来帝国主义在华投资的趋势和特点，外资在我国经济上的比重，以及解放以后的新变化。不论就征引材料、组织材料和说明材料讲，著者充分运用了谨严、细致的精神，很严肃地做好了他的著述工作。这样对于中国经济史的各方面的原始材料加以精细研究发掘，是很值得重视的劳作。
  一本书变成了两本书
    潘公昭先生译、中外出版社一九四九年九月初版的《苏联城乡关系》和潘朗先生译、中华书局一九五○年一月初版的《苏联怎样克服城乡关系》二书，除了书名不同，原著者被译为“柯锡列夫”和“柯什立夫”不同的字样外，全书文字是一样的。据读者反映：照情形看，很可能是潘朗先生或潘公昭先生把译稿重复出版，因而形成了“一书两印”。对于这样的事情，读者是有权责难的。
    《图书评论》（本刊前身）第九号上曾经刊载了读者对《中国说唱诗》和《春云离婚》一书两印的指责，最近王亚平同志已在《文艺报》三十二期上作了检讨与说明。对于上述两本小书重复出版的经过，我们也希望潘公昭、潘朗先生对读者说明一下。
    我们的意见是：一书数印在生产上是一种浪费，这种少有的现象是应该消灭的。反映这一件事，主要目的在此。
  另外“两本内容雷同的书”
    太原山西大学陈寿琦先生寄给了我们一篇稿件，题目是：《两本内容雷同的书》。他指出：一、李正文先生著，三联书店一九五○年三月初版的《战后经济学说》和二、特拉赫金堡作，李少甫先生译，中华书局一九四九年十一月初版的《资本主义总危机与资产阶级政治经济学》，两本书虽有著与译的不同，而“内容几乎完全一样”，因而他判断“李正文君的著作必是译本无疑。”
    来稿中说明：“将李正文君著作与李少甫君译本对照一下，也有一些不同之处：李正文君在正文前面加上个小引，后面加上了一句话，正文中也有一些添加语。此外在每节前面都加上了一个小标题，而且加得极合适。文字也比李译本流利得多。”像这种情形，如果用上“编译”字样出版并加上一个说明，是更符合于事实的，也是更好的一种方式。
    《战后经济学说》原是一篇专文，可能是在解放以前在国民党反动派统治区的进步刊物中发表过的。文中还保留了若干回避反动派检查的痕迹，例如书三页引用斯大林的话用着“欧洲曾有一个伟人说过”，甚至还把斯大林的名字变译为“姚席福”（Joseph的变译，见书六五页）。可是把这些痕迹一直保留在一九五○年三月出版的书中，这就是可笑的疏忽了。
    直到今天为止，很审慎地检查过去印过的出版物和重版书，做好一切必要的修订，还是著作家和出版家应该共同认真搞好的一项重要工作。
