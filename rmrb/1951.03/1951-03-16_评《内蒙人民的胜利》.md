　　Review of "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia"
      Zheng Wensen
    Our China is a multi-ethnic country, but due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term implementation of Han chauvinism and brutal oppression of minority nationalities, serious divisions were created between the nationalities. It was not until the minority nationality regions were liberated, and we correctly implemented the ethnic policy, that the divisions between the nationalities gradually began to disappear.
    "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia" is a film that reflects the great victory of our ethnic policy. It correctly reflects the Central People's Government's policy towards all ethnic groups in the country, and clearly tells us how to implement this policy in order to shatter the conspiracies of American imperialism and its running dogs, and achieve great victory.
    This film depicts the cruelty and enslavement of the people by the Inner Mongolian princes before liberation, as well as the Inner Mongolian people's resentment towards the upper-class rule and their deep suffering. It embodies this through vivid descriptions of life and struggle, through artistic images, not only allowing the audience to see and feel, but also deeply touching the audience's hearts.
    The film appropriately reflects the true situation of some Inner Mongolian princes. When the Liberation War had turned from defense to a powerful counter-offensive, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang sent special agents to Inner Mongolia to carry out conspiracies, before the Inner Mongolian people had generally awakened, some princes still maintained some subtle relationships with the Chiang bandits, directly or indirectly. This subtle "sitting on two boats" attitude is appropriately portrayed in "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia." For example, Prince Doerji, although he had outwardly expressed his support for the People's Government's policy, still indicated to his assistant Tuslegeqi to hide Kuomintang agents in the lama temple; at the Aobao meeting, when our military representative discovered the disguised Kuomintang agents, he still tried to perfunctorily cover up for them. …But Prince Doerji did not dare to openly oppose the Communist Party, and some of his measures at this moment (such as stopping the construction of the Prince's mansion, so that a large number of herdsmen could be freed from hard labor) also complied with our basic spirit. And our "attitude towards the Inner Mongolian princes is: as long as they are willing to serve the people, resolutely oppose American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the government will certainly give them a chance to reform based on the principle of unity" (Su He's words). Because we resolutely implemented this policy, we finally severely suppressed the die-hard Mongolian traitor Tuslegeqi, and also won over Prince Doerji. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong's ethnic policy.
    The reason why the film "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia" has great educational significance is that it not only makes us understand how the ethnic policy was implemented and won victory in Inner Mongolia, but also tells us how to implement the ethnic policy in other ethnic groups.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term enslavement and oppression of the Inner Mongolian people caused many undue misunderstandings among the Inner Mongolian people towards the Han people, which created an emotional distance between the two peoples for a long time. The coldness and suspicion of the protagonist Dondub towards Su He and others in "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia" is precisely a reflection of this view and emotion. This cannot be blamed on him; it is the evil consequence of the Kuomintang reactionaries' brutal enslavement and tyrannical oppression. Our cadres can understand this emotion, so when Su He and Menghe Batel encountered Dondub's cold attitude, they not only did not blame him, but instead used practical actions to influence and educate him; in addition, he experienced the Kuomintang's humiliation of him, and the Kuomintang agents' impolite behavior towards his lover Wuyun Bijinge, which made him gradually realize that the Kuomintang reactionaries and Mongolian traitors were his real enemies.
    The film's portrayal of the process of Dondub's ideological change and development is very reasonable. The editors and directors grasped his ideological contradictions, resolved these contradictions, and presented them very realistically and powerfully.
    Enhe Sen, who plays Dondub, is a Mongolian. It is said that he is not an experienced actor, but he showed such outstanding achievements the first time he appeared on the screen.
    "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia" clearly tells us: If we do not mobilize the masses, do not rely on the masses, or if the way we mobilize the masses is not good, we cannot effectively win over the middle and upper-class rulers of that ethnic group. Similarly, if we adopt an inappropriate policy of accommodation towards the middle and upper classes, we cannot truly mobilize the masses.
    This is the theme of "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," and it is also the most meaningful education that this film gives us. (Editor's note: This film will be released on the 17th of this month)

### 评《内蒙人民的胜利》

　　评《内蒙人民的胜利》
      郑文森
    我们中国是一个多民族的国家，但由于国民党反动派长期施行大汉族主义，横暴地压迫少数民族的结果，造成了民族之间的严重隔阂，一直到少数民族的地区获得解放之后，由于我们正确地执行了民族政策，民族之间的隔阂才开始逐渐消除。
    《内蒙人民的胜利》是一部反映我们民族政策伟大胜利的影片。它正确地反映了中央人民政府对于国内各民族的政策，并清楚地告诉我们如何去执行这个政策，才能粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋，并取得伟大的胜利。
    这部影片，描写了解放前内蒙王公对人民的残暴与奴役，以及内蒙人民对于上层统治的愤恨情绪与深重的灾难。它通过有血有肉的生活与斗争的描写，通过艺术形象体现出来，不仅让观众能看到，能感觉到，而且一直深入到观众的心里。
    影片恰当地反映了内蒙某些王爷的真实情况。当解放战争已由防御转入强大反攻，蒋介石匪帮派遣特务到内蒙进行阴谋活动的时候，当内蒙人民还未普遍觉醒之前，有一部分王爷对于蒋匪帮还直接间接地保持着一些微妙的关系。这种“脚踏两只船”的微妙态度，在《内蒙人民的胜利》中有了恰当的表现。譬如道尔基王爷吧，他虽然表面上已表示过赞成人民政府的政策，但仍示意其协理吐斯勒格其把国民党特务暗藏到喇嘛庙里；在敖包会上，当我军事代表发现了伪装的国民党特务时，他仍设法敷衍、包庇。……但道尔基王爷并不敢公开反共，而且他在此时此刻的某些措置（如停止了建筑王爷府，使大批牧民能从苦役中解放出来），也还符合我们的基本精神。而我们“对于内蒙王公的态度是：只要他肯为人民效力，坚决反对美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，政府一定本着团结的方针，给他改过自新的机会”（苏合语）。由于我们坚决地执行了这一方针，所以最后严厉地镇压了死心塌地的蒙奸吐斯勒格其，也争取了道尔基王爷。这是毛泽东民族政策的伟大胜利。
    《内蒙人民的胜利》这部影片之所以具有巨大的教育意义，就因为它不仅使我们懂得民族政策如何在内蒙贯彻执行，并获得胜利的情形，而且也告诉我们，应当怎样把民族政策贯彻到其他民族中去。
    国民党反动派对内蒙人民的长期奴役与压迫，造成了内蒙人民对汉族人民许多不应有的误会，使得两族人民在一段很长的时间存在着感情的距离。《内蒙人民的胜利》中的主角顿得布开首对苏合等的冷淡与怀疑，就正是这种看法与情绪的反映。这不能怪他，这是国民党反动派的残暴奴役与横蛮的压迫所造成的恶果。我们的干部是能理解这种情绪的，所以当苏合和孟赫巴特尔遇到顿得布这种冷淡态度时，不仅没有责怪他，反而以实际行动去感化他，教育他；再加上他经验了国民党对他的凌辱，和国民党特务对他爱人乌云碧靳格的无礼举动，使他逐渐认识了国民党反动派与蒙奸才是他真正的敌人。
    影片对顿得布思想变化与发展过程的描写，是很合情理的。编导同志把握了他的思想矛盾，并解决了这个矛盾，而且表现得很真实，很有力量。
    饰顿得布的恩和森同志，是蒙古人。据说他并不是一个有经验的演员，但第一次出现银幕，就表现出这样卓越的成就。
    《内蒙人民的胜利》明确地告诉了我们：如果我们不发动群众，不依靠群众，或者发动群众的工作方式不好，我们就不可能有效地争取那个民族的中上层统治者。同样，如果我们对中上层采用不适当的迁就的方针，也不可能真正发动起群众来。
    这是《内蒙人民的胜利》的主题内容，也是这影片给予我们最有意义的教育。（编者按：这部影片将在本月十七日公映）
