　　Across the Danning River, the Chongchon River, the Taedong River, the Pipa River... the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's technical corps, along with the military progress, are rushing to repair railways day and night. Once, when the weather cleared and the snow melted, someone discovered a pit exposed in the snowy ground at a bridgehead, with corpses inside. Upon digging, four pits were found in succession, all filled with corpses. More than two hundred people, both men and women, including children in their teens, and a woman with an infant no more than a week old on her back. The nearby farmers told the soldiers: Last October, on a cold, dark night, when everyone was asleep, a train came from afar and stopped on the bridge. Suddenly there was a burst of gunfire, and after a long time, the train drove away again. After dawn, the farmers went out and saw a large pile of dead bodies piled up in the river. Later, after this place was liberated, the farmers on both sides, with tears in their eyes, fished out their dead compatriots and buried them in the bomb craters at the bridgehead. After a few snowfalls, the traces were all covered.
    As soon as this news spread, the soldiers building the bridge saw people coming from far and near every day, weeping and crying to identify the corpses. The corpses changed color and were difficult to recognize. Those sorrowful mothers and wives searched for the marks of their loved ones on the necks and hands of the dead. If they couldn't find them, some women went one by one to tear the clothes of the deceased, to see if the stitches were sewn by themselves for their husbands. After recognizing them, they cried loudly holding the corpses, grabbed the soldiers' hands, pointed to the south, cried for a while, and cursed for a while.
    The soldiers were all saddened by what they saw, and from morning till night, they talked about the brutality of the American-Li bandits whenever they had a chance. "Is there any humanity left in this? If they were to fight into China, our homes would also be finished!" "Resist America, Aid Korea, speed up bridge repairs; Defend our homes, protect our country, defeat the United States!" "The fighting troops rely on bayonets, we rely on building bridges!" The soil was frozen more than three feet deep and was impossible to dig. Soldier Yu Zhancai pointed to the ground and said, "This hard crust is just like the area occupied by the American devils. Digging away the hard crust is equivalent to annihilating the American troops!" In the cold winter night, airplanes often flew overhead. They dared not light torches. The river was dark, and no one could be seen; only the sound of "tick-tack-tick-tack" could be heard, as the pickaxe hit the pebbles, creating sparks. They worked at night, and they also worked during the day. Enemy planes strafed, and Zhang Yushen's legs were scalded by bomb fragments, becoming red and swollen. Others told him to go down, but he gritted his teeth and said: "As long as a person doesn't die, he will never leave the scene!" How could he go down? The task given by the superiors stipulated the date on which the bridge would be open to traffic. For this reason, Sun Hongjie, the squad leader of the Fourth Squad, suffered from dysentery for more than twenty days, but he never rested for a single day. For this reason, Tian Wenliang's carpentry class persisted for twenty-five hours in one breath, drinking only a bowl of porridge. …
    On January 23rd, the Fourth Squad worked all night. When they went to sleep after dawn, twenty-four enemy planes pounced from all directions. For a time, bombs exploded everywhere, and fires broke out everywhere. Sun Hongjie woke up from his dream and ran out wearing only his shirt and pants. His waist was injured by shrapnel. He used his hand to peel the shrapnel from his wound, endured the pain, and carried the wounded back and forth several times. But the wounded did not care about themselves, some only asked: "Has the leader suffered any losses? If the leader does not suffer losses, our task can continue to be completed!" Che Qirong had been lowering wooden cages into the river for eight consecutive nights. This time, his leg was injured, and he bled too much. Before he died, he grabbed the company commander's hand and said: "This time I won't be able to do it..." and slowly closed his eyes. The soldiers were both angry and hateful, pointing to the sky and cursing: "Bomb away! You can bomb our people to death, but you can't bomb the hearts of ten thousand people!"
    This is truly hatred upon hatred. The soldiers of the Fourth Squad buried their sacrificed comrades and said in grief and anger: "We must avenge the Korean people! Avenge our class comrades!" That night, they went up to the bridge again. That night, all the soldiers on the Jiang Bridge became ruthless. Under the moonlight, from far away, they all wore small cloth shirts. Because it was cold and there were many people, they were breathing from their mouths, and steam was rising from their heads, steaming, like a thin mist. When they finished work at dawn, the bridge had already been repaired. That day was the 24th, and they were preparing to test the car at night.
    The soldiers breathed a sigh of relief and felt particularly relaxed. They all said that they had won and wanted to rest. After noon, the planes came again, making a lot of noise, but no one paid much attention. The regiment headquarters suddenly issued an order, immediately telling them to go to the bridge. As the team moved out, the instructor said as he walked: "The enemy has bombed the bridge! For the victory of the front line, let them bomb it. There is no difficulty in front of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!"
    When everyone ran to the bridge, they were all furious, stomping their feet and cursing: "Damn it, you can bomb it, and I can repair it! Let's give him a counterattack!" They lifted their cotton-padded jackets and started working again in a fiery manner. ...
    That night, the bridge was restored again. On the day it was scheduled to be completed, a train crossed the bridge and drove to the front line. The car was full of boxes of all sizes, all of which were desperately awaited by the front line to win the battle.

　　仇上加仇
    本报特约记者  杨朔
    跨过大宁江、清川江、大同江、沸流江……，中国志愿军的技术兵种随着军事的进展，日夜往前赶修铁路。有一回，天晴化雪，有人发现一座桥头雪地上露出个坑，里边有死尸。一掘，连续发现四个坑，都填满了尸首。连男带女二百多口，里面有十几岁的小孩，还有个妇女身上背着个顶多一周岁的婴儿。附近的农民对战士说：去年十月一个寒冷的深夜，人都睡觉了，远处开来一列火车，停到桥上。忽然响了阵枪，许久许久火车才又开走。天明后农民出去一看，江心堆着一大堆死人。后来这地方解放，两岸的农民这才含着眼泪，把他们死难的同胞捞出来，埋到桥头炸弹坑里。落上几场雪，痕迹都盖住了。
    这消息一传出去，架桥的战士们，天天看见远近有人哭哭啼啼地来认尸。死尸变了色，不好认，那些愁苦的母亲、妻子便从死尸的脖子上和手上寻找自己亲人的记号。实在找不出，有位妇女就挨着一个个撕死者的衣裳，看看是不是自己替丈夫缝的针线。认出后，抚尸大哭，拉住战士的手，指着南方，哭一阵，骂一阵。
    战士们看得个个心酸，一天到黑，得空就谈论着美李匪帮的残暴。“这还有点人味么？要打到中国去，咱们的家也要完蛋了！”“抗美援朝，加紧修桥；保家卫国，打倒美国！”“战斗部队靠刺刀，咱们就靠修桥！”土冻的三尺多深，刨不动，战士于振才指着地面说：“这块硬盖，就好比美国鬼子占的地方。刨掉硬盖，就等于歼灭美军！”寒冬深夜，头顶上常有飞机，不敢点火把，江面上一片漆黑，不见人影；光听见踢嚓喀嚓，镐头碰着卵石，直冒火星。夜晚干，白天也干。敌机扫射，张玉深的两腿叫炸弹皮烫伤，又红又肿。旁人叫他下去，他咬咬牙说：“只要人不死，一定不下现场！”怎么能下去呢？上级给的任务，规定了这座桥要通车的日期。为了这个，四小队的班长孙洪杰害痢疾二十几天，一天也不歇。为了这个，田文良的木工班一气坚持二十五小时，只喝一顿稀饭。……
    一月二十三号，四小队干了一宿，天亮后睡觉时，敌机二十四架四面扑上来。一时间炸弹乱响，到处起了火。孙洪杰从梦里惊醒，穿着单衣裤跑出来。腰炸伤了，用手把自己伤处的弹皮剥出来，忍着痛，往来几次抬送伤员。伤员却并不关心自己，有的只是问：“首长受到损失没有？首长不受损失，我们的任务就能继续完成！”车启荣曾经连续八夜在河心下木笼，这回打伤了腿，流血流的太多，临断气，拉住连长的手说：“这回我算捞不着干了，……”慢慢地闭上眼睛。战士们又气又恨，指着天空骂道：“你炸吧！炸死我们的人，炸不死万人的心！”
    这真是仇上加仇。四小队的战士掩埋了自己牺牲的同志，悲愤地说道：“我们要给朝鲜人民复仇！给阶级战友复仇！”当晚又上了桥。那一夜，江桥上全体战士都发了狠。月亮地下老远一望，影影绰绰地一律穿着小布衫。天冷人多，嘴里喘气，头顶又冒热气，气腾腾的，像是一片薄雾。傍明收工，桥已经修好。当天是二十四号，夜晚准备试车。
    战士们吐了口气，心境特别轻松，都说胜利了，要休息休息。赶过午，飞机又来了，不知在那里闹腾一阵，也没人十分在意。团指挥所忽然来了命令，立刻叫上桥。队伍拉出去，指导员随走随说：“敌人把桥炸了！为了前线的胜利，让他炸吧，在中国人民志愿军面前没有困难！”
    大家跑到桥上一看，都来了火，跺着脚骂道：“操他妈，你能炸，老子能修！咱们给他来个反冲锋！”棉袄一撩，火杂杂地又动起手来。……
    当夜桥就又复原了。就在预定完工的那天，一列火车开过桥去，开上前线。车上装满大大小小的箱子，都是前方打胜仗最迫切等待着的玩意。
