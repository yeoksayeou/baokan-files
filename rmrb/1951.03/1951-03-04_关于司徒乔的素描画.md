To the Editor Regarding Si Tuqiao's Sketches:

    The sketches of Mr. Si Tuqiao published in the February 25th issue of "People's Literature" gave me great stimulation. Previously, my understanding of imperialist exploitation of colonies was only theoretical and not profound or sharp enough. After seeing Mr. Si Tuqiao's paintings and the accompanying explanations, I shed tears. This painting is a valuable education for me and has deeply moved me.

　　关于司徒乔的素描画编辑同志：
    二月二十五日《人民文艺》所载司徒乔先生的素描画，给我以很大的刺激。以前我对帝国主义剥削殖民地，只有理论上的认识，不够深刻尖锐。我看了司徒乔先生的画和那说明后淌下了眼泪，这幅画对我是一种宝贵的教育，深深地感动了我。
