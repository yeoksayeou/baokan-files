*Studying Culture* Publication
	Strengthening the spare-time education of workers, peasants, and cadres is one of the main tasks of current cultural and educational work. The bi-monthly publication *Studying Culture*, sponsored by the National Workers' Spare-time Education Committee, is a welcome publication. Judging from the inaugural issue of the publication published on March 1st, it should be successful in educating people in current affairs, history, geography, language and other sciences in a variety of ways. However, since the publication is aimed at laborers *who recognize about five or six hundred to a thousand characters*, some of the articles in this issue are a bit too deep.

*Taking the Patriotic Labor Competition a Step Further*
	How to transform the blitz-style labor production competition into a regular labor production competition is an important task at present. *Chinese Workers* Issue 13 focused on publicizing this issue. Important articles include Dong Xin's *Taking the Patriotic Labor Competition a Step Further*, which summarizes the initial gains of the patriotic labor competition across the country over the past three months, and points out that the suddenness, impractical formalism, and appropriate solutions to the reward problem in the competition must be overcome. Attention must be paid to workers' lives, labor protection, sound grass-roots trade union organizations, and strengthened leadership in order to further improve the patriotic labor competition and become a regular working method. In response to the serious shortcomings of simply increasing labor intensity and working overtime in the current labor competitions in various places, the article *The Valuable Experience of the "May 3rd Factory" Trade Union Leadership in Regular Labor Competitions* in the Northeast points out that the combination of trade union mobilization work and administrative scientific management work, uniting technicians and staff, combining labor and technology, using employee representative meetings, advanced producer conferences and other methods to implement leadership intentions, and establishing inspection systems, timely summarization of rewards, are the key to consolidating competition work.

New Columns in *Kaiming Juvenile* and *Progressive Youth*
	From January this year, *Kaiming Juvenile* and *Progressive Youth* have successively added new columns for grammar learning and essay writing. *Grammar Learning* in *Kaiming Juvenile*, written by Mr. Lv Shuxiang, has published two articles in January and February, *Units of Language and Units of Writing* and *A Sentence and a Half Sentence*. From February, the publication also added *Essay Clinic*, which analyzes and treats common problems in essay writing by young people and teenagers in general. Guidance on grammar and writing is very important at present. Many people (not just young people and teenagers) ignore the rules of Chinese language and writing, ignore the fundamental cultivation of writing, so that incomprehensible sentences and messy articles are often found in many books and newspapers. We hope that this issue will attract the attention of general newspapers and periodicals.

Pay Attention to the Publication of Books on Minority Cultures
	The Peking University Press has recently published a book *Outline of the Islamic Calendar*, compiled by Professor Ma Jian, which makes a preliminary analysis of the accuracy of the Islamic calendar, and also puts forward some influences of the Islamic calendar and the Western calendar on the development of the Chinese common calendar. The comparison table of the Islamic calendar and the Western calendar is very convenient for checking. We hope that more people will conduct better research in the field of ethnic minority culture and accurately explain a truth that has always been ignored in Chinese history: the unity, friendship and cultural exchange of all ethnic groups in China is an important factor in historical progress.

Report on Important New Books
	Stalin, *National Question and Leninism* (translated by Cao Baohua and Mao Anqing, published by People's Publishing House, priced at 1,600 yuan) was originally a long letter from Stalin in reply to Men Shikov, Kovar Qiuke, etc. It was written on March 18, 1929 and was not publicly published at that time. It was not published for the first time until Volume 11 of the *Collected Works of Stalin*, printed by the Soviet State Political Books Publishing House in 1949. The book contains four sections: 1. The concept of "nation"; 2. The emergence and development of nations; 3. The future of various nationalities and their languages; 4. The Party's policy on national issues. This is an important work by Stalin on the national question, and together with his book *Marxism and the National Colonial Question*, it is a brilliant model in the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist theory.
	The People's Publishing House has recently published a book *Collection of Important Documents on Land Reform* (priced at 5,700 yuan), which is the most complete collection of land reform documents available. It includes important resolutions on this issue by the Central People's Government and major administrative regions (People's Government, Military and Political Committee) in the second half of 1950. In addition to land reform documents, documents on various special land disposal, rent reduction and debt issues, peasant associations and people's courts, suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and punishment of illegal landlords, urban-rural relations and cadre discipline in land reform are also collected.
	The Era Publishing House published *Looking at America from the Back Door* by Vasilyev, translated by Shi Dai (priced at 12,000 yuan). This book is the author's *"Travelogue"* from the autumn of 1944 to the autumn of 1947 when he lived in the United States. It exposes the ugliness and corruption of the so-called *"American way of life"* from the side - from *"daily life and culture"*. There is no theoretical debate here, it just shows the readers the facts that happen every day: this is the *"civilization"* of the United States - the civilization of beasts! But the author also includes *"another America"* - the America of laborers, in his *"Travelogue"*, pointing out that "the irreconcilable struggle between the two Americas is intensifying day by day", and the voice of American progressive forces "is becoming more and more confident and loudly singing".
	In order to help learn from the trade work experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, Sanlian Bookstore published a *New Trade Translation Series*, which publishes one volume per month, mainly selecting and translating appropriate parts from the Soviet magazine *Foreign Trade* and other monographs.
	The first volume of the translation series, *The State of Foreign Trade under Two Different Systems*, was published last month, containing 11 papers. In addition to analyzing the recent economic achievements and foreign trade development of the people's democratic countries, it also provides a comprehensive analysis of the current situation of foreign trade and raw material commodity markets in imperialist countries, which can show the sharp contrast between the economic situations of the two worlds. The second volume, *The Nature and Organization of Soviet Trade*, was published on the 2nd of this month, and its content also includes discussions on the economic and trade development of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Mongolian People's Republic.

Workers' Daily Invites Advanced Group Leaders of Factories in the Capital to a Forum
	In order to exchange experiences in participating in the Ma Hengchang Group competition movement, the Beijing Workers' Daily invited 22 advanced group leaders from factories in the capital to hold a forum on March 4th. First, group discussions were held according to the nature of production, and then seven group leaders reported to the conference. The Workers' Daily published the record of the forum on a large scale on March 10th, reporting the rich gains of the meeting. The meeting not only reflected the various experiences of workers in the capital in participating in the Ma Hengchang Group competition movement, but also discovered some problems. Holding such a forum is of great help to the actual movement and is beneficial to both the leading organs and the workers.
	The experience of the Workers' Daily in holding such forums is worth referring to. Newspapers actively invite activists from workers and peasants and other strata to talk and hold forums to discuss the issues they are most concerned about, and publish the valuable materials in the newspapers, which is a method of establishing a close relationship between newspapers and the masses.

Strengthen the *Party Life* Column
	The *Party Life* column of the Nanjing Xinhua Daily has been changed to a regular page published every ten days from the 13th issue on March 1st, and a formal *Party Life* editorial board has been established. In the 13th issue, three articles on the ideological and political study of land reform by party members were published. The *Party Life* of the Xinhua Daily was founded on August 15, 1950, and only twelve issues have been published in half a year. Now it has been decided to change it to a ten-day publication.
	The *Party Life* of the Shanxi Daily is more regular. On March 7th, the newspaper announced the reporting prompts for the *Party Life* column in March, pointing out the reporting focus in March, and asking readers to participate in the discussion of a question published in the *Party Life* column in February.
	The *Party Life* column is a special column for ideological and political education of Communist Party members, unfolding criticism and self-criticism, and discussing party building issues in front of the masses. Strengthening and improving the *Party Life* column in quantity and quality is of great educational significance to both Communist Party members and non-Communist Party members.

Incorrect Editor's Note
	In the land reform areas of Enping and Heshan in Guangdong, there were blind actions of destroying temples and shooting at statues of gods, which were divorced from the masses. On February 28th, the Southern Daily published the notice of the Guangdong Provincial Government to the Yuezhong Special Commissioner's Office and the Enping Heshan County Government in a prominent position, and strictly corrected this mistake. Yongming County and Changsha County in Hunan also discovered acute *"anti-superstition"* activities. On March 3rd, the Changsha Mass Daily published two letters from readers and attached an editor's note to criticize them.
	Doing so is necessary. Timely correcting this common mistake that may occur in various places is an important method of exerting the guiding role of newspapers. However, the editor's note of the Changsha Mass Daily has more important omissions. According to the letter from the reader published by the newspaper: Tianwang Temple in Daming Township, Changsha is said to have been built in the Tang Dynasty. After the land reform, it was decided to transform it into a primary school building. The interior should be transformed, and the Buddha statue, which is about fifteen or six feet tall, should be dug out. The masses did not approve of it because of superstition. The editor said in the editor's note: "This is very good", but it should be discussed with the masses. Obviously, the editor here ignored that if this Tianwang Temple is really a Tang Dynasty building, it is a very important cultural relic and should not be "transformed" and "dug out", but should be protected.

　　出版动态
  《学文化》的出版
    加强劳动者和工农干部的业余教育，是当前文教工作的主要任务之一。全国职工业余教育委员会主办的《学文化》半月刊是值得欢迎的刊物。从三月一日出版的该刊创刊号看，用多种多样的方式，就时事、史地、语文以及其他各门科学进行教育，应当是有成绩的。但该刊是以《认识五六百字到千字左右》的劳动者做对象的，本期内有些文章嫌深了一点。
  《把爱国主义的劳动竞赛提高一步》
    怎样把突击式的劳动生产竞赛变为经常性的劳动生产竞赛，是当前的一个重要任务。《中国工人》第十三期，以这一问题为中心进行了宣传。重要的文章有董昕的《把爱国主义的劳动竞赛提高一步》，概述了三个月来全国范围内爱国主义劳动竞赛的初步收获，并指出必须克服竞赛中的突击性、不切实际的形式主义，适当解决奖励问题，关心工人生活，注意劳动保护，健全工会基层组织，加强领导作用，才能把爱国主义劳动竞赛更加提高一步，成为经常的工作方法。针对目前各地劳动竞赛中单纯提高劳动强度，加班加点的严重缺点，东北《五三厂工会领导经常性劳动竞赛的宝贵经验》一文指出：工会动员工作和行政的科学管理工作结合，团结技术人员职员，使劳动与技术结合，利用职工代表会、先进生产者会议等方式贯彻领导意图，以及建立检查制度，及时总结奖励，是巩固竞赛工作的关键。
  《开明少年》《进步青年》的新栏目
    从今年一月起，《开明少年》与《进步青年》陆续添了语法学习与文章作法的新栏目。《开明少年》上的《语法学习》，由吕叔湘先生撰写，在一、二月份内已发表了《语言的单位和文字的单位》《一句话和半句话》两篇文章。该刊从二月份起，又增加了《文章诊疗室》，就一般青年、少年朋友作文时所常犯的毛病加以分析、诊治。《进步青年》除在二月份转载了叶圣陶先生发表在《新观察》上的《写话》外，二、三月份还连续登载了《作文指导》。语法与写作的指导，在目前是很重要的。许多人（不只青年、少年朋友）无视中国语文的规律，无视写作的根本修养，以致许多书籍报刊中经常发现不通的句子、凌乱的文章。我们希望这个问题引起一般报刊的注意。
  重视有关少数民族文化书籍的出版
    北京大学出版部新近出版了马坚教授编译的一本《回历纲要》，对于回历的精确性作了初步的分析，也提出了回历西历对于中国通用历发展的某些影响。回历西历对照表，很便于检查。我们希望有更多的人在少数民族文化方面进行更好的研究，精确地阐明在中国历史上一向被人忽略的一条真理：中国各族人民的团结友爱和文化交流是历史进步的一个重要因素。
  重要新书汇报
    斯大林著《民族问题与列宁主义》（曹葆华、毛岸青译，人民出版社出版，定价一六○○元）原为斯大林答复勉希科夫、柯华尔秋克等的一封长信，是在一九二九年三月十八日写的，当时并未公开发表过。一九四九年苏联国家政治书籍出版局印行的《斯大林全集》第十一卷才第一次把它刊登出来。本书内容包括四节：一、“民族”概念；二、民族的产生和发展；三、各民族和各民族语言的未来；四、党在民族问题方面的政策。这是斯大林在民族问题方面的重要著作，与他所著《马克思主义和民族殖民地问题》一书，同为马克思列宁主义理论宝库中的辉煌典范。
    人民出版社最近出版了一本《土地改革重要文献汇集》（定价五七○○元），是目前有关土地改革文件编集中最完整的一本书。内容包括一九五○年下半年内中央人民政府及各大行政区（人民政府、军政委员会）有关这一问题的重要决议。除土地改革文件外，关于各种特殊土地处理、减租与债务问题、农民协会与人民法庭、镇压反革命活动与对不法地主的惩治、土地改革中的城乡关系及干部纪律等方面文件，也都搜集在内。
    时代出版社出版了华西里叶夫著、史岱译的《从后门看美国》（定价一二○○○元），这一本书是作者从一九四四年秋到一九四七年秋居留美国时期的“见闻录”，它从侧面——从“日常生活和文化方面”来暴露所谓“美国生活方式”的丑恶和腐败。这里不涉及理论争论，它只是把那些每日每日发生的事实指给读者看：这就是美国的“文明”——野兽的文明！但作者也把他的“见闻录”包括“另外一个美国”——劳动者的美国，指出“两个美国的不能妥协的斗争一天一天在加强着”，美国进步势力的声音“也愈来愈有信念地、响亮地唱响着”。
    为帮助学习苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易工作经验，三联书店出版了一种《新贸易译丛》，每月出版一册，主要是选译苏联《对外贸易》等杂志论文及其他专著中的适当部分。
    该译丛第一册《两种不同制度下的对外贸易状况》，于上月出版，共收论文十一篇，除分析人民民主国家最近的经济成就和对外贸易发展外，并对帝国主义国家的对外贸易及原料商品市场现况，作了综合的论析，可以看出两个世界的经济状况的鲜明对比。第二册《苏维埃贸易的性质和组织》，本月二日出版，内容兼及波、捷、罗和蒙古人民共和国经济与发展贸易状况的论述。
  工人日报邀请首都各工厂先进小组组长座谈
    为了交流参加马恒昌小组竞赛运动的经验，北京工人日报在三月四日邀请了首都各工厂二十二个先进小组组长举行座谈会，首先按生产性质分别进行小组座谈，再由七个小组长向大会作了报告。工人日报三月十日用很大篇幅发表了座谈会的纪录，报道这次会议的丰富的收获。会议不仅反映出首都工人参加马恒昌小组竞赛运动的各种经验，而且发现了一些问题，举行这样的座谈会，对实际运动有很大的帮助，对领导机关和工人群众都是有益的。
    工人日报举行这种座谈会的经验，是值得参考的。报纸主动地邀请工人农民群众中以及其他各阶层中的积极分子谈话和举行座谈会，讨论他们最关心的问题，把其中的有价值的材料发表在报纸上，是一种建立报纸与群众之间的紧密关系的方法。
  加强《党的生活》栏
    南京新华日报《党的生活》栏从三月一日的第十三期开始，改为十日刊的定期专页，成立了正式的《党的生活》编委会，在第十三期中，发表了三篇关于党员进行土地改革的思想政策学习的文章。新华日报的《党的生活》自一九五○年八月十五日创刊，半年中只出了十二期，现在决定改为十日刊。
    山西日报的《党的生活》是比较经常的，三月七日该报在报纸上公布三月份《党的生活》栏的报道提示，指出三月份的报道重点，并要求读者参加对二月份《党的生活》栏所发表的一个问题的讨论。
    《党的生活》栏是对共产党员进行思想政治教育，展开批评和自我批评，并在群众面前讨论党的建设问题的专栏。在量上和质上加强和改进《党的生活》栏，对共产党员和非共产党员都有重大的教育意义。
  不正确的按语
    广东恩平鹤山土地改革地区发生了脱离群众的捣毁神庙、拿神像打靶的盲目的行动，南方日报二月二十八日以显著的地位发表了广东省政府给粤中专署和恩平鹤山县政府的通知，严正地纠正了这个错误。湖南永明县和长沙县也发现了急性地“反迷信”的活动，长沙大众报三月三日发表了两封读者来信，并附有编者的按语加以批评。
    这样做是必要的，及时纠正这种各地都可能发生的带普遍性的错误，就是发挥报纸的指导作用的重要方法。但长沙大众报的编者按语却有较重要的疏忽。据该报发表的读者来信中说：长沙大明乡天王寺据说是唐代建筑，土改后决定改为小学校舍，内部要加以改造，并要把身长约一丈五六尺的大佛像挖掉，群众因迷信关系不赞成；编者在按语中说：“这是很好的”，但应该和群众商量。显然，编者在这里忽略了如果这个天王寺真是唐代建筑，这就是很重要的文物古迹，不应该加以“改造”和“挖掉”，而应该注意加以保护。
