　　How to Implement the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries
　　Pan Zhenya

　　The Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China have been promulgated and implemented by the Central People's Government. This is not only: "In order to provide cadres and the masses with legal weapons to suppress counter-revolutionary activities, to provide personnel judging counter-revolutionary criminals with sentencing standards, and to overcome or prevent right-leaning and left-leaning tendencies in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, there is a need for regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries." (Report by Deputy Director Peng Zhen on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries) Moreover, in order to correct the many confused thoughts among cadres, to improve cadres' legal theory, understanding, and judicial capabilities, to promote repentance and meritorious service among counter-revolutionaries, and to prevent them from inciting backward elements to echo or harbor them, such concise and clear legal provisions are needed to correctly apply the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not questioned, and meritorious service is rewarded," combining suppression with leniency, and reducing right-leaning or left-leaning tendencies.

　　From now on, we will have a certain standard for determining crimes and sentencing. Judicial personnel in various regions will surely be able to, as Deputy Director Peng Zhen instructed: "If the crime deserves death, the execution should be resolutely carried out; if the crime does not deserve death, it should not be carried out. For those whose crimes are between deserving death and not deserving death, do not execute them either, only execute those who deserve death and must be executed, and important counter-revolutionary elements with conclusive evidence." This is correct. Who are those who should be killed and must be killed? According to the provisions of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, there are approximately four types of people:

　　(1) The masterminds and commanders of armed mass rebellion and others with major crimes shall be sentenced to death (first paragraph of Article 5);

　　(2) Others, such as criminals listed in Article 3, Article 4 (1), various clauses of Article 6, various clauses of Article 7, Article 8, various clauses of Article 9, Article 11, and the first paragraph of Article 12, important elements shall be sentenced to death, and secondary elements may be sentenced to life imprisonment; those with lighter circumstances may be sentenced to a certain period of imprisonment respectively. However, for criminals in Article 12, in addition to organizers and masterminds being sentenced according to the importance of their roles, others are limited to active participants and shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not less than three years. Those who are blindly following or coerced do not constitute counter-revolutionary crimes and should be tried by the People's Court as general escapees.

　　(3) Important elements among the criminals listed in Article 10 and Article 12 shall be sentenced to death, secondary elements may be sentenced to life imprisonment, and general elements may be sentenced to a statutory period of imprisonment respectively.

　　(4) Others "who aim to overthrow the people's democratic regime and undermine the people's democratic cause" are all considered counter-revolutionary crimes (Article 2) and may be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or a fixed period of imprisonment according to the above three categories (Article 10).

　　Apart from the masterminds and commanders of the first type of criminals being relatively easy to distinguish, how should we distinguish the facts of "other major crimes," "major circumstances," "important," "secondary," and "lighter circumstances" and use them as sentencing standards? We should comprehensively consider each person's specific circumstances and "seek truth from facts" to deliberate and determine. For example:

　　1. Are they the primary counter-revolutionary elements? Are they the main people who plot, instigate, and organize various counter-revolutionary activities?

　　2. How serious is the damage to the people's cause, what is the nature of the damage, and what is the size of the danger or harm caused or potentially caused by this?

　　3. Are they incorrigible and continuing to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation?

　　In short, those who are extremely wicked and everyone says deserve to be killed should be killed. These regulations are formulated by concentrating the will of the people. Judicial personnel in various regions should be able to stand on the people's position and use this weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship to give severe punishments to the primary counter-revolutionary elements and to the special agents and spies who are incorrigible and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, and there should be no more leniency. …

　　Others who do not need to be killed but should be detained must also be detained. The length of the detention period should be determined and judged separately based on the specific circumstances of each case and each criminal. When implementing supervision, it must be firm and force them to work, so that they can thoroughly repent and correct their past mistakes, correct the past biases of "boundless leniency" and "slack suppression," and also prevent "boundless suppression" from killing those who do not need to be killed and detaining those who do not need to be detained. It should be true to the crime and handled appropriately, so that there is no injustice or letting go, neither relaxing on the bad guys, nor mistakenly falling into the enemy's trick of retaliating against good people. Only in this way can we achieve the effect of correctly suppressing all counter-revolutionary activities and effectively protecting the interests of the people.

　　All counter-revolutionary elements should thoroughly repent, surrender and reform, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Those who think they can侥幸免死 (hoping to escape death by luck), continue to do evil, or "falsely confess" or "falsely be active" with the intention of deceiving and plotting sabotage, whether the crimes were committed before or after the implementation of these regulations, should be punished in accordance with these regulations (Articles 14 and 18). People's governments at all levels must grant them self-renewal in accordance with the policy of combining suppression with leniency. This article should be well publicized in various places, so that every household knows it and raises vigilance. If they know about the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, the people should fully expose and secretly report them (Article 19); no harboring or sheltering is allowed (Article 13). This is also a task of protecting the country and defending the homeland, which is as important as resisting America and aiding Korea. U.S. imperialism is now colluding and plotting with special agents and spies lurking everywhere to carry out sabotage. The timely publication of these regulations is sufficient to strengthen suppression. We should warmly support it and ensure that these regulations are quickly implemented.

　　怎样贯彻惩治反革命条例的实施
    潘震亚
    中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例业经中央人民政府公布施行，这不只是：“为了给予干部和群众以镇压反革命活动的法律武器，为了给予审判反革命罪犯的人员以量刑的标准，为了在坚决镇压反革命活动中克服或防止右的偏向和左的偏向，需要有一个惩治反革命的条例。”（彭真副主任关于镇压反革命和惩治反革命条例问题的报告）而且，为了纠正干部中许多混乱思想，为了提高干部法律的理论、认识和审判能力，为了促使反革命分子悔过与立功，以及防止它们煽惑落后分子附和或包庇，也需要这样简要概括明确的法条，才能正确运用“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”镇压与宽大相结合的政策，减少右或左的偏向。
    今后，我们定罪量刑既有一定的尺度，各地审判人员，必能如彭真副主任所指示：“如果其罪该杀，即应坚决处刑；如果罪该不杀，即应不杀。对于介乎可杀可不杀之间者，也不要杀，只杀那些该杀和必须杀的人，有确实证据的重要反革命分子。”这是正确的。那一些是应该杀和必须杀的呢？按照惩治反革命条例的规定，约有四种类型的人：
    （一）持械聚众叛乱的主谋者、指挥者及其他罪恶重大者处死刑（第五条前段）；
    （二）其他如第三条、第四条第一项，第六条各款所列之罪犯，第七条各款之罪犯，第八条、第九条各款之罪犯，第十一条、第十二条前段之罪犯，重要分子应处死刑，次要分子可处无期徒刑；其情节较轻者，可分别处以一定期间之刑。惟第十二条之罪犯，除组织者、主谋者应分别重要次要量刑外，其他只限于积极参加者，应处三年以上徒刑。若系盲从或胁从者，不成立反革命罪，应由人民法院照一般越狱犯审判。
    （三）第十条、第十二条所列罪犯中之重要分子应处死刑，次要分子可处无期徒刑，一般者可分别处法定期间之刑。
    （四）其他“凡以推翻人民民主政权，破坏人民民主事业为目的”之罪犯，都是属于反革命罪（第二条），得比照上述三类，分别处以死刑、无期徒刑或各该罪法一定期间之徒刑（第十条）。
    除第一类罪犯之主谋者与指挥者较易区别外，其他所谓“其他罪恶重大”、“情节重大”、“重要”、“次要”、“情节较轻”等，究应怎样区别其事实，而为量刑标准？则应综合每个人全部具体情况“实事求是”地斟酌认定。例如：
    一、是不是反革命首要分子，是不是主谋、策动、组织各种反革命活动的主要人？
    二、破坏人民事业的轻重和性质及由此所引起或可能引起的危险或损害之大小如何？
    三、是不是怙恶不悛，解放后仍继续进行反革命活动？
    总之，恶贯满盈，国人皆说可杀者即应杀。本条例是集中人民意志而制定的，各地审判人员，当能站在人民立场，使用这个人民民主专政的武器，对于各种反革命的首要分子，对于解放后怙恶不悛、继续进行反革命活动的特务间谍分子给以从重处刑，不应再有宽纵。……
    其他不须杀而应该监押的，也须监押。监押期间的长短应斟酌每案每个人犯具体情况分别认定判决。在执行监管的时候，必须牢固，并强制其劳动，使其痛改前非，改邪归正，纠正过去“宽大无边”的和“镇压松怠”的偏向，同时也须防止“镇压无边”把不须杀的也杀了，不须监押的也监押起来，应该罪情真切，处理恰当，做到无枉无纵，既不放松坏人，也不误中敌人反噬好人的奸计。这样才能收到正确镇压一切反革命活动，切实保障人民的利益的效果。
    一切反革命分子应彻底悔悟，自首自新，立功赎罪，凡认为可以侥幸免死，继续作恶，或“假坦白”、“假积极”、意图欺骗潜图破坏等，无论在本条例施行前或施行后所犯罪过，都应依照本条例惩治（第十四条第十八条）。各级人民政府必须本镇压与宽大相结合的政策许以自新。对此一条例各地应很好宣传，做到家喻户晓，提高警惕。如知道反革命分子的活动，人民应尽情揭发、密告（第十九条）；不容窝藏包庇（第十三条）。这也是保家卫国的任务，和抗美援朝一样重要。美帝现正勾结、策动特务、间谍潜伏各处进行破坏，本条例及时公布，适足以加强镇压。我们应当热烈拥护，并保证这个条例迅速贯彻实施。
