Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 13th: The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau uncovered the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organizations "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps Underground Work General Team, Beijing-Tianjin District Team" and the "People's Founding and Advancement Association Tianjin Branch," which carried out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of Catholicism, in February. A total of 19 principal and accessory criminals, including Jin Yupei, Liu Ximan, He Demin, Zhang Wei (also known as Zhang Siwen), Zhao Hongyan, Xu Fengxiang, and Zhao Bingzhong, were arrested in the two cases, and a radio transmitter, two pistols, and other counter-revolutionary evidence were seized.

The ringleader of the bandit "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps," Jin Yupei (a Catholic and member of the bandit Three People's Principles Youth League), organized reactionary landlord armed forces in April and May 1948, cooperated with the bandit army to attack our Jizhong Liberated Area, and committed all kinds of crimes in Renqiu, including massacring and robbing the people, and raping women. After the liberation of Tianjin, Jin accepted a lurking mission and served as the leader of the bandit "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps Underground Work General Team, Beijing-Tianjin District," instructing his henchman Mo Weiqi to use teaching as a cover to carry out sabotage activities in secret. After Shanghai suffered bombing by American-Chiang Kai-shek planes last spring, Jin actively contacted his old subordinates and spread rumors. Liu Ximan, a member of the special agent organization, was a Catholic priest from Renqiu, Hebei, who often supplied intelligence to French priest Shang Jianxun (Shang was the principal criminal in the international spy case uncovered in Xianxian in 1947). After the liberation of Tianjin, Liu used the alias Liu Fuyi, posing as an employee of the Qian De Zhuang Fuyuan Coal Yard, and spread rumors in the church that the American-Chiang Kai-shek forces would return. Liu also instructed Zhang Siwen (a Catholic priest) to carry out fake signatures in an attempt to sabotage the anti-American patriotic reform movement of Catholics in Tianjin.

The ringleader of the bandit "People's Founding and Advancement Association Tianjin Branch," Zhao Hongyan, was a Catholic and a KMT Central Statistics Bureau special agent. After the liberation of Tianjin, Zhao lurked in Zhensheng Primary School, a Catholic school, as a physical education teacher. After July last year, Zhao and Xu Fengxiang, a KMT Military Statistics Bureau special agent, jointly organized the bandit "People's Founding and Advancement Association Tianjin Branch," and successively recruited special agents Zhao Bingzhong, Wang Jizhu, and Ma Junqing, etc., dividing them into "assassination," "liaison," and "propaganda" groups to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. The bandits plotted to sabotage a power plant, but they were arrested before they could succeed.

After Jin and others were arrested, religious figures in Tianjin unanimously expressed their support for the people's government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Zhao Zhenya, the vicar of the Tianjin Diocese of the Catholic Church, said: "Whoever carries out counter-revolutionary activities that endanger the country must be resolutely punished. It is bad for the reputation of the church to have special agents in the church who collude with imperialism. Now that the people's government has arrested these bad elements, the Catholics in Tianjin all support it." Wu Kezhai, the chairman of the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance Reform Promotion Association, said: "It is very correct for the people's government to arrest special agents who use Catholicism as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. We thank the people's government for helping the church to eliminate the scum who are exploited by imperialism."

　　天津市破获以宗教为掩护的特务组织
    该市天主教人士拥护政府帮助清除教会中的败类
    【新华社天津十三日电】天津市人民政府公安局于二月间破获以天主教为掩护进行反革命活动的美蒋特务组织“公教青年报国团地下工作总队平津区队”和“民众建国协进会天津支部”。两案共捕获主从犯金玉培、刘西满、何德民、张维（又名张思温）、赵鸿雁、徐凤翔、赵炳忠等十九人，搜获电台一部、手枪二支和其他反革命证据多件。
    匪“公教青年报国团”主犯金匪玉培（天主教徒、匪三青团员）曾于一九四八年四、五月间，组织反动地主武装，与匪军配合袭击我冀中解放区，在任邱一带残杀、抢劫人民，奸淫妇女等，无所不为。天津解放后，金匪接受潜伏任务，任匪“公教青年报国团地下工作总队平津区队长”，指使其爪牙墨维祺以教书为掩护，暗中进行破坏活动。去春上海遭受美蒋飞机轰炸后，金匪更积极联络旧部，散布谣言。该特务组织的成员刘匪西满，河北任邱人，系天主教神父，曾经常供给法籍神父尚建勋（尚匪为一九四七年在献县破获的国际间谍案的主犯）等情报。刘匪于天津解放后化名刘弗溢，伪装谦德庄福源煤栈职员，在教堂内散布美蒋重来的谣言。刘匪并指使张匪思温（天主教神父）进行假签名，阴谋破坏天津市天主教徒的反美爱国革新运动。
    匪“民众建国协进会天津支部”主犯赵鸿雁系天主教徒、国民党中统特务分子。赵匪于天津解放后潜伏天主教教会振声小学任体育教员。去年七月后，赵匪与国民党军统特务分子徐匪凤翔共同组织匪“民众建国协进会天津支部”，先后拉拢了特务分子赵匪炳忠、王匪积铸、马匪俊青等，分组“暗杀”、“联络”、“宣传”三组，进行反革命活动。该匪等曾阴谋破坏我某发电厂，未能得逞，即被捕获。
    金匪等就捕后，天津市宗教界人士对人民政府镇压反革命分子的措施一致表示拥护。天主教天津教区副主教赵振亚说：无论是谁进行危害国家的反革命活动，都必须坚决予以制裁。教会中有了和帝国主义勾结的特务分子，对教会的名誉是不好的。现在人民政府逮捕了这些坏分子，天津市的天主教徒都是拥护的。天津市天主教自立革新促进会筹备会主任委员吴克斋说：人民政府逮捕了以天主教做掩护来进行反革命活动的特务分子，是非常正确的。我们感谢人民政府帮助教会清除了受帝国主义利用的败类。
