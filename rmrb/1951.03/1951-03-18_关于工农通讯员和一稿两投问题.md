Concerning Worker-Peasant Correspondents and Duplicate Submissions

　　I. Reply to Liaoxi Daily:

　　Your letter of March 7th has been received.

　　Factory directors and all union chairmen, engineers, and technicians in state-owned factories are part of the working class. Whether they are university graduates or students who have studied abroad, as long as they actively participate in newspaper work, enthusiastically write articles for the newspaper, report on various fresh developments in the lives of the masses, strive to promote advanced experiences in all aspects of building a new China, and correctly criticize various shortcomings in the work of the Party and the government so that these shortcomings can be corrected because they are discovered, they can be worker correspondents and should be welcomed. The worker-peasant correspondent movement is a mass movement, not a political organization. It is wrong to only pay attention to whether factory directors, union chairmen, engineers, and technicians are engaged in physical labor and whether their thoughts and feelings have been proletarianized, without paying attention to whether they are participating in newspaper work with patriotic enthusiasm. Some engineers or technicians may not have completely reformed their thinking, but this does not prevent them from seeing new things and advanced experiences, nor does it prevent them from seeing various shortcomings in their work. Similarly, it is wrong to only pay attention to whether rural correspondents are working in the fields.

　　You said that if factory directors, union chairmen, engineers, and technicians participate in writing articles and can be considered worker correspondents, then most of your existing correspondents are worker correspondents. Indeed, they are worker correspondents. But this cannot be a reason for complacency. Because they are only a very small part of the workers and worker correspondents. The same is true for rural correspondents; rural cadres and rural intellectuals are only a very small part of the rural masses and rural correspondents. From this, it can be seen that constantly dispatching reporters to factories and rural areas to organize advanced production workers and activists to write articles for the newspaper, and continuously expanding the ranks of worker-peasant correspondents, must be the newspaper's main and fixed task.

　　It is completely unnecessary for you to divide correspondents into worker-peasant correspondents and general cadre correspondents and issue two different types of correspondent certificates. The necessary thing is to regularly organize them to write articles, not to issue them certificates. It is very clear that if an activist who has not received a correspondent certificate submits an article to the newspaper, the newspaper should not and will not reject their submission because they have not received a certificate from the newspaper.

　　Of course, it is necessary to conduct a statistical analysis of correspondents within the newspaper according to region and profession. The purpose is to see the distribution of correspondents from this statistical material, so that the newspaper itself knows which aspects it should continue to develop correspondents in. But if their profession is used as a title to call correspondents, such as saying someone is a worker correspondent or someone is a cadre correspondent, and filling it in on the correspondent certificate, then it is meaningless.　　Editor

　　II. Reply to Comrade Zhang Ming of Shandong:

　　The News Administration's telegram to the East China News and Publishing Bureau on the issue of worker-peasant correspondents pointed out that the phenomenon of duplicate submissions is mainly caused by newspapers not paying attention to worker-peasant correspondents and reader submissions, so it should be the responsibility of the newspaper editorial department. The point in the same telegram that "worker-peasant correspondents are not staff members of the newspaper editorial department, and there is no fixed organizational relationship between them and the newspaper" is to prevent the malpractice of duplicate submissions. Because some people are simultaneously employed as correspondents by two or more newspapers in the same area, if each newspaper adopts some form of organization to fix the relationship between them and the correspondents, and each newspaper stipulates that the same correspondent should write a certain number of articles for the newspaper each month, the correspondent is overwhelmed and can only copy the same manuscript into several copies and distribute them to various newspapers. This is the result of newspapers requiring to establish a fixed organizational relationship with correspondents, and its further development and abuse can make the worker-peasant correspondent movement completely lose its meaning. For example, there used to be a situation in Shanghai where some factories, because worker correspondents held multiple positions and had heavy tasks, were afraid that they would delay their work, so they simply set up a special "unified submission" agency in the factory to take over the articles required by various newspapers from worker correspondents, and this agency uniformly submitted articles to various newspapers, restricting various newspapers from developing their own correspondent organizations. If we believe that duplicate submission is a method that can be allowed to exist, then the development and abuse of this method is in fact encouraged. The "unified submission" method implemented by some factories in Shanghai may be adopted by more factories. However, this "unified submission" method has the nature of monopolization and substitution, and can become a means for certain trade unions, peasant associations, or administrative responsible parties to restrict their members from writing articles for newspapers, can weaken the relationship between the worker-peasant masses and newspapers and the newspaper's mass work, and of course, it is even more impossible to improve the political enthusiasm of the worker-peasant masses.

　　From this, it can be concluded that duplicate submission is a bad phenomenon. The News Administration's reply to the East China News and Publishing Bureau, emphasizing that newspaper editorial departments should pay attention to mass work and change their attitude towards worker-peasant correspondents and reader submissions, in order to gradually reduce this phenomenon, is completely correct. However, the only way to reduce this phenomenon is to strengthen the newspaper's own mass work and carry out specific persuasion work according to the actual situation, rather than immediately issuing a method by the newspaper editorial department or other relevant agencies to forcibly prohibit it. In the future, after this phenomenon gradually decreases, in order to finally eliminate this phenomenon, only educational methods can be used, and not any coercive methods.

　　Does opposing duplicate submissions hinder the spread of advanced experiences and important inventions? We believe it does not. Because after such manuscripts are published in newspapers, even if the local Xinhua News Agency reporter does not immediately send them to the Xinhua News Agency for nationwide broadcast, foreign newspapers will reprint them. However, what if such manuscripts are ignored by the editorial department after being sent to the newspaper, or even thrown into the wastebasket? Shouldn't they be buried? It must be admitted that this situation is possible. Precisely because it is possible, the News Administration has repeatedly requested newspapers in the past year to pay attention to worker-peasant correspondents and reader submissions, and newspapers have in fact made great efforts in this work. If a correspondent finds that his manuscript is ignored or buried, he can and should criticize the editorial department. If a manuscript does have content but is rejected due to the ignorance of the editorial department, then, needless to say, the correspondent has the right to submit the same manuscript to other newspapers.

　　Can a correspondent simultaneously serve as a correspondent for other foreign newspapers? We believe that if he is willing, he can do so. Because such correspondents must be activists among the masses, and their enthusiasm for newspaper work should be encouraged. However, it should be suggested to him not to send the same manuscript to several newspapers in the same location. Even if he reluctantly serves as a correspondent for several newspapers, it is advisable to submit different manuscripts to different newspapers. On the other hand, newspapers should also try to avoid mutual duplication in the development of worker-peasant correspondents. The News Administration's reply to the East China News and Publishing Bureau pointed out that "in fact, there may be some situations, that is, Party workers first write for the central and local Party newspapers due to their consciousness, and trade union workers first write for the trade union newspapers, etc.," which can be regarded as a direction for newspapers to develop correspondents as long as they work hard. Every place and every department in the country has Party workers, and every city and every industrial and mining enterprise has trade union workers. The same is true for other newspapers such as peasant newspapers and youth newspapers. As long as the newspaper work is done well and the content can fully meet the needs of their respective basic readers, it is entirely possible for various newspapers with different basic readers to have their own different correspondents actively participating in its work. However, the development of correspondents in such a direction must be based on the correspondents' consciousness and willingness, and should not be achieved by any coercive means. For example, if a trade union worker is unwilling to serve as a correspondent for the trade union newspaper, but is willing to serve as a correspondent for the Party or Communist Youth League newspaper, he has the freedom to choose. If the trade union newspaper uses trade union power to interfere, then the newspaper violates the principles of sound newspaper work.

### 关于工农通讯员和一稿两投问题

专栏：

　　关于工农通讯员和一稿两投问题
     一、答辽西日报辽西日报：
    三月七日来信收到。
    公营工厂的厂长和一切工厂中的工会主任、工程师和技术人员是工人阶级的一部分，不论他们是大学毕业生或留学生，只要他们积极参加报纸工作，热心为报纸写稿，报道群众生活中的各种新鲜事物，竭力推广建设新中国的各方面的先进经验，正确地批评党和政府工作中的各种缺点使这些缺点因为被发现而得以改正，他们就可以是工人通讯员，并应当受到欢迎。工农通讯员运动是群众运动，不是政治组织。如果只是注意厂长、工会主任、工程师和技术人员是否从事体力劳动，思想感情是否已经工人化，而不注意他们是否以爱国主义的热情参加报纸工作，是不对的。某些工程师或技术人员很可能思想改造还不彻底，但是这并不妨碍他们看见新鲜事物和先进经验，也不妨碍他们看见各种工作中的缺点。同样，对农村通讯员如果仅仅注意他们是否下地干活，也是不对的。
    你们说，如果厂长、工会主任、工程师和技术人员参加写稿可作为工人通讯员的话，那么，你们现有的通讯员便绝大部分是工人通讯员了。诚然，他们是工人通讯员。但是这不能作为自满的理由。因为他们仅是工人群众和工人通讯员中为数极少的一部分。农村通讯员也一样，农村干部和农村知识分子不过是农村群众和农村通讯员中为数极少的一部分。由此可以知道，经常派遣记者在工农群众中去组织生产先进分子和积极分子为报纸写稿，不断地扩大工农通讯员的队伍，必须是报纸的主要的和固定的工作。
    你们把通讯员划分为工农通讯员和一般干部通讯员，发给两种不同的通讯员证，是完全不必要的。必要的事情是经常组织他们写稿，而不是发给他们证书。这是很明白的，一个没有领到通讯员证的积极分子如果向报纸投稿，报纸不应该而且也不会因为他没有领到报社的证件而拒绝他们投稿。
    当然，在报社内部分别按地区和职业等进行一种关于通讯员的统计是必要的。其目的在于从这种统计材料中看出通讯员的分布情形，使报纸本身知道应当继续向那些方面去发展通讯员。但是如果把他们的职业当作一种头衔去称呼通讯员，如说某为工人通讯员，某为干部通讯员，并填写在通讯员证上面，那就没有什么意义了。    编者
  二、答山东张明同志张明同志：
    新闻总署关于工农通讯员问题复华东新闻出版局一电指出一稿两投现象主要是由于报纸不重视工农通讯员和读者来稿造成的，所以应由报纸编辑部负责。同一电文中所指出的“工农通讯员不是报纸编辑部的工作人员，他们与报纸之间没有固定的组织关系”一点，则是为了防止一稿两投的流弊。因为有些人同时被同一地方的两家以上报纸聘请为通讯员，如果各报都采取某种组织形式把他们与通讯员之间的关系固定下来，每一家报纸都规定同一个通讯员每月应为报纸写稿若干，通讯员穷于应付，当然只好把同一稿件抄写几份分发各报了事。这是报纸要求与通讯员建立固定的组织关系的结果，其进一步发展和滥用可以使工农通讯员运动完全失去它的意义。比如，上海就曾经有过这样一种情形：有的工厂因为工人通讯员身兼数职，任务繁重，怕他们耽误工作，干脆在厂里增设一个“统一发稿”的专门机构，把各报向工人通讯员所要的稿子包下来，由这个机构统一向各报发稿，限制各报自行发展通讯组织。假如我们认为一稿两投是一种不妨任其存在的办法，那么，这种办法的发展和滥用就在事实上受到了鼓励。上海某些工厂所实行的“统一发稿”办法可能会为更多的工厂所采用。但是这种“统一发稿”办法带有包办代替的性质，可以成为某些工会农会或行政负责方面限制其成员为报纸写稿的手段，可以削弱工农群众与报纸之间的关系和报纸的群众工作，当然更谈不到提高工农群众的政治积极性了。
    由此可以得出结论：一稿两投是一种不好的现象。新闻总署给华东新闻出版局的答复强调报纸编辑部应当重视群众工作，改变对待工农通讯员和读者来稿的态度，以争取逐渐减少这种现象，是完全正确的。但是用以减少这种现象的办法只能是加强报纸本身的群众工作，并按照实际情况进行具体的说服工作，而不是马上由报纸编辑部或其他有关机关定出一条办法来硬性地加以禁止。在将来，在这种现象逐渐减少以后，为了使这种现象最后趋于消灭，也只能用教育的而不是任何带有强制性的方法。
    反对一稿两投，对于先进经验和重要发明的传播有没有妨碍呢？我们认为没有妨碍。因为这种稿件经报纸刊载以后，即使当地新华社记者没有立即发给新华总社向全国广播，也会有外地报纸转载。但是，万一这种稿件送到报社以后为编辑部所忽视，或甚至塞进了字纸篓，岂不被埋没了吗？应当承认，这种情况是可能有的。唯其可能有，所以新闻总署在过去一年来一再要求各报重视工农通讯员和读者的来稿，而各报在事实上也已经对这个工作作了极大的努力。如果通讯员发现自己的稿件被忽视或被埋没，可以而且应当向编辑部提出批评。如果某一稿件确有内容但由于编辑部的无知而落选，那么，不用说，通讯员完全有权把同一稿件改投其他报纸。
    一个通讯员是否可以同时兼任其他外地报纸的通讯员呢？我们认为，如果他愿意，是可以这样作的。因为这种通讯员一定是群众中的积极分子，他对于报纸工作的这种热情是应当受到鼓励的。但是应当向他建议，不要把同一稿件抄送同一地点的几家报纸。即使他在不得已的情况下兼任了几家报纸的通讯员，也以把不同的稿件投给不同的报纸为宜。另一方面，报纸发展工农通讯员也应当尽可能避免互相重复。新闻总署给华东新闻出版局的答复指出“事实上可能会有这样一些情形，即党工作者由于他们的自觉而首先为中央和地方的党的机关报写稿，工会工作者首先为工会机关报写稿等”，可以看作报纸发展通讯员的一种只要努力就可以有所成就的方向。全国每一个地方和每一个部门都有党工作者，每一个城市和每一个工矿企业都有工会工作者，其他如农民报和青年报也一样，只要报纸工作做得好，内容能充分适合各自的基本读者的需要，各种拥有不同的基本读者的报纸都有自己的不同的通讯员积极地参加它的工作是完全可能的。不过各报通讯员在这样一个方向的发展，必须以通讯员的自觉自愿为基础，而不应当是以任何带有强制性的手段来达到这种发展。比如，有一个工会工作者不愿意担任工会机关报的通讯员，而愿意为党的或青年团的机关报担任通讯员，他有选择的自由。要是工会报纸利用工会权力加以干涉，那么，这个报纸便违反了健全的报纸工作的原则。
