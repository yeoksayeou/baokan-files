Several Experiences in Leading Production Competitions in the Central South Region
Policy Research Office of the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

For several months, many public and private factories and mines in the Central South region have successively launched production competition movements. Based on the initial experiences of various places, the following key points should be grasped when guiding a production competition within the scope of a factory or mine:

1.  Production competition should rely on a genuine mass-based and conscious movement, which is a development process from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex, and from partial to overall. In terms of the scope of the competition, it should expand from several groups and one workshop to the entire factory. In terms of the tasks of the competition, it can be advanced from temporary competitions for a single production task or a single production process to regular competitions for the entire production process. In terms of labor conditions, it should also gradually be improved from simple manual labor competitions to technical improvements. Only by following this route of gradual improvement from small to large can the competition be continuously heightened with a base and a position. Conversely, if one is greedy for a subjectively grandiose plan and is eager to launch a competition in the entire factory or even the entire city in one fell swoop, it will either collapse halfway or become a mere formality.

2.  In each stage of the competition, the factory management must promptly put forward specific production plans and enterprise reform requirements that meet the actual needs to guide and grasp the development direction of the competition. Blind competition cannot last and may sometimes have an adverse effect on production. First, the factory and workshop must formulate plans for the entire factory and workshop based on the tasks assigned by the higher authorities and the actual conditions of the unit (technical equipment, previous production results, estimated potential to be tapped...). Then, make great efforts to help groups and individuals formulate plans as specific goals of the competition. The process of formulating plans is actually a process of in-depth mobilization of the masses. In terms of enterprise reform, specific requirements should also be put forward based on the current urgent aspects to be improved (such as establishing systems, implementing quotas on a trial basis, rectifying labor discipline...) to achieve through competition. Only in this way can the competition truly serve to improve production and promote the rationalization of production.

3.  In-depth ideological leadership of the workers. The old views of the worker masses on factories, labor, and the relationship between fellow workers, which have been living in the old society for a long time, are not easy to be cleared away for a while. It often becomes an ideological obstacle to launching the competition. Therefore, the competition cannot be entrusted to the enthusiasm of a few people for a while, but should be built on the continuous improvement of the consciousness of the majority of the masses, that is, to make the majority of workers realize the consistency of personal interests and the interests of enterprise production. Unilateral emphasis on the interests of one aspect cannot make the competition develop normally and maintain a constant high morale. At the beginning of the competition, it is necessary to deeply understand the ideological situation of the masses, explain the significance of the competition positively, criticize incorrect views from the side, and break various concerns (fear of falling behind, fear of being scolded). In the process of the competition, it is also necessary to pay attention to "feeling the thoughts" at any time, and use self-education methods to solve some common and prominent ideological problems. Overcome new ideological obstacles, correct the conservative mood of being satisfied with temporary achievements, and rely on regular propaganda and mobilization work to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses.

4.  There must be a correct reward system. No rewards, few rewards, or indiscriminate rewards without certain standards will cause workers to feel bad about the competition, affect internal unity of workers, and reduce production efficiency. At present, most public and private enterprises in the Central South region do not yet have technical quotas, and the reward system cannot reach perfection, but in general, the method of simple evaluation should be avoided, and the method of rewarding over-task work based on production records supplemented by democratic evaluation should be adopted. Therefore, in the competition, systems such as production records, production charts, and finished product inspection should be established quickly. The reward standards can be specifically formulated according to the financial situation of each enterprise, but they must be based on the principle of appropriately improving the production enthusiasm of workers, rewarding more labor, and ensuring expanded reproduction. In order to stimulate technical improvement, special attention should be paid to rewarding rationalization proposals.

5.  In the competition, consciously discover activists, cultivate model workers and model groups, and establish advanced banners to turn dead abstract struggle goals into living concrete examples. Promote the transformation of middle-of-the-road elements and drive the backward layers. In this regard, special attention should be paid to preventing the phenomenon of subjectively fixing models, limiting to a few advanced elements, and disconnecting advanced elements from the masses; it is also necessary to correct the problem of not relying on regular cultivation, but temporarily holding meetings to select labor models. For the model achievements of a working group or a workshop collective, in addition to praising the entire body, special praise should be given to the advanced person who plays a leading role to encourage personal ambition and lead the masses forward.

6.  If the competition remains in the competition of simple manual labor operation, the labor productivity created will always be limited. In order to create a high degree of productivity, it is necessary to implement the combination of labor and technology in the competition, and constantly improve the technical level of workers, so that the potential of production can be fully utilized. To this end, we must pay attention to mobilizing technical personnel to go deep into the front line and combine with workers to improve technology, and do not let them stand aside from the competition. It is necessary to do a good job in technical learning, take technical classes, advocate respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and sign apprenticeship contracts... so that technology is gradually mastered by general workers. In addition, vigorously promoting the rationalization proposal movement and encouraging technical improvements and inventions are also indispensable aspects to encourage workers to use their brains and improve their technology.

7.  In terms of leadership, the coordinated action and division of labor of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League are of great significance. It is clear that the production competition must be decided by the factory management committee on the production tasks and policies, and then directly led by the labor union, and the workers must implement and ensure its completion. The administration is responsible for production plans, specification inspections, material supply, etc. The labor union is responsible for mobilizing, organizing, and educating all employees, and grasping all aspects of the movement. The Youth League should take the lead in the work and do a good job in propaganda and mobilization. The Party organization mainly unites the masses through the Party members in the Youth League and the labor union to ensure the completion of the competition tasks. In case of major problems, they should be resolved uniformly at the factory management committee. General problems rely on daily contact, exchange of information, and coordinated action.

8.  In terms of leadership methods: we must go deep into the masses. First of all, do a good job in key points and create typical examples. Sum up experience, correct shortcomings, and solve problems in a timely manner, and then promote it to the overall situation and strive for balanced development of the movement. Pay attention to relying more on workers and staff to participate in and grasp the specific work of the competition (such as production records, time measurement, quality inspection, etc.) to avoid purely top-down leadership. Experience has proved that production competition is an extremely meticulous and complex mass work, and it is absolutely impossible to do well if one is satisfied with general calls and principled guidance.

    中南区领导生产竞赛的几条经验
    中共中央中南局政策研究室
    数月以来，中南各城市公私厂矿，已经先后有不少开展起生产竞赛运动。综合各地初步经验，对指导一个厂矿范围内的生产竞赛，应掌握如下几个要点：
    一，生产竞赛要依靠一个真实的群众性的自觉运动，是由低级到高级，由简单到复杂，由局部到全体的发展过程。从竞赛的范围上说，应由几个小组，一个车间普及到全厂。从竞赛的任务上说，可以由临时的一件生产任务一个生产过程的竞赛，推进到经常地全部生产过程的竞赛。在劳动条件上，同样由单纯劳力操作比赛逐渐提高到技术上的改进方面去。只有循着这样由小而大逐步提高的路线指导竞赛，才能使竞赛有阵地有基础的不断高涨。相反，如果贪图主观庞大的计划，急于一举搞起全厂甚至全市的竞赛，将不是半路垮台，就是流于形式。
    二、竞赛的每一阶段上，工厂管理方面必须适时提出切合实际需要的具体的生产计划和企业改革的要求，指导与掌握竞赛的发展方向。盲目的竞赛，是无法持久的，有时还会给生产以不利影响，首先厂与车间要根据上级任务，结合本单位情况（技术设备，前段生产成绩，估计可能发挥出的潜力……），订出全厂、车间计划。然后再以大力帮助小组、个人订计划，做为竞赛的具体目标。订计划的过程，实际就是深入动员群众过程。在企业改革上，亦应根据当前迫切需待改进的方面（如建立制度、试行定额、整顿劳动纪律……），提出具体要求，通过竞赛实现。这样才能真正使竞赛能为提高生产、促进生产合理化服务。
    三、深入对工人群众的思想领导。工人群众长期生活于旧社会，对工厂对劳动以及对工友间相互关系上旧的看法，是一时不易清除的。常常成为发动竞赛的思想障碍。故不能将竞赛寄托于一时的少数人的热情激发上，而要建筑在多数群众不断提高的自觉上，亦即要使多数工人觉悟到个人利益与企业生产利益的一致性。片面强调一方面利益，都不能使竞赛发展正常，保持情绪经常高涨。在竞赛发动之初，固然要深入了解群众思想情况，正面讲清竞赛意义，侧面批评不正确看法，打破各种顾虑（怕落后，怕挨骂）。在竞赛过程中，还要注意随时“摸心思”，用自我教育的方式，解决一些普遍而突出的思想问题。克服新的思想障碍，纠正满足一时成绩的保守情绪，并要依靠经常宣传鼓动工作，鼓舞群众热情。
    四、必须有正确的奖励制度。不奖励、少奖励、或滥奖励而无一定标准，都会造成工人对竞赛的恶感，影响工人内部团结，影响生产效率降低。目前中南各地公私企业绝大多数尚无技术定额，奖励制度还不能达到完善地步，但一般应避免单纯评议办法，而应采用以生产纪录为主，民主评议为辅的估工超任务奖励办法。故在竞赛中应迅速建立生产纪录、生产图表、成品检验等制度。奖励标准可据各企业财务情况具体制订，但必须以能适当提高工人生产积极性、多劳多得、保证扩大再生产为原则。为刺激技术提高，对合理化建议的奖励，尤应注重。
    五、在竞赛中，要有意识地发现积极分子，培养模范工人，模范小组，树立先进的旗帜，把死的抽象的奋斗目标变成活的具体的范例。推动中间分子改造与带动落后层。在这上面，特别注意防止主观固定模范、局限于少数先进分子、使先进分子与群众脱节的现象；也要纠正不依靠平时培植，临时开会选派劳动模范的毛病。对一工作小组、一车间集体的模范成绩，除表扬全体外，应予起主导作用的先进人以特殊表扬，以鼓舞个人上进心，带领群众前进。
    六、竞赛如果停留于单纯劳力操作上的比赛，所创造劳动生产率总是会有限制的。为要创造出高度的生产率，就必须在竞赛中贯彻劳力与技术结合，不断提高工人技术水平，才能使生产的潜力充分发挥出来。为此，就要注意发动技术人员，深入现场，与工人结合，改进技术，勿使其侧身于竞赛以外。要搞好技术学习，上技术课，提倡尊师爱徒，订立师徒合同……使技术逐渐为一般工人所掌握。此外，大力推动合理化建议运动，鼓励技术改进与发明创造，也是促使工人开动脑筋，提高技术不可缺少的方面。
    七、在领导方面，党政工团的协同动作与分工配合，有其重要意义。明确生产竞赛必须是由工厂管理委员会决定生产任务与方针后，由工会直接领导，工人执行并保证其完成。行政负责生产计划，规格检查，材料供应等。工会负责发动组织教育全体职工，及掌握运动的各环节。青年团要在工作中起带头作用，做好宣传鼓动工作。党的组织则主要是通过青年团及工会中的党员，团结群众，保障竞赛任务的完成。遇有重大问题，要在工厂管理委员会上统一解决，一般问题依靠平时接头、互通情报，协同动作。
    八、在领导方法上：必须要深入群众。首先搞好重点，创造典型。及时总结经验，纠正缺点，解决问题，进而推广到全面，争取运动发展的平衡。注意更多依靠工人、职员参加掌握竞赛的各项具体工作（如生产纪录，工时测定，质量检查等等），避免单纯自上而下的领导。经验证明：生产竞赛是一个极细密复杂的群众工作，满足于一般号召，原则指导，是决然不能做好的。
