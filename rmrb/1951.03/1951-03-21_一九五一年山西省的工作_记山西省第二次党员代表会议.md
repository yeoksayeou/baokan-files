    The Work of Shanxi Province in 1951
    ——A Record of the Second Shanxi Provincial Party Congress
    A Comprehensive Analysis of the Situation is a Necessary Foundation for Determining Various Tasks

    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its Second Party Congress in Taiyuan City on February 16th. A total of 705 delegates and observers attended the meeting. Comrade Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the conference and delivered a political report. The most profound impression left on the delegates by this conference was the comprehensive political analysis of the current situation of all classes and strata in the province, the sharp presentation of the problems existing in the current practical work, and, on this basis, the pointing out and elucidation of the various tasks facing the Party in 1951. This clarified several fundamental concepts in everyone's minds: opposition to American imperialism and political education on loving the motherland are the driving forces for promoting various tasks; economic construction must be closely integrated with political struggle; learning to do business is part of a complete production perspective; the Party's united front policy and the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries are unified and must be resolutely implemented.
    How did the conference conduct its political analysis? Initially, the delegates from various regions universally analyzed and examined the work in their respective regions based on the political report and the reports on the work summary of the past year and the work tasks for this year, raised problems existing in the work, and studied solutions. Finally, Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, summarized the opinions as follows:
    (1) Currently, from the overall perspective, the atmosphere of unity among the people of all classes in the province's united front is unprecedentedly increasing. This is because in the past year, people's representative conferences or people's congresses at all levels have been universally convened throughout the province; the decision of the Central People's Government on unified financial work has been resolutely implemented, as well as the policies of stabilizing prices and adjusting industry and commerce; especially since the second half of last year, the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement to defend the homeland has been launched throughout the province, thus consolidating and expanding the unity of the four classes. However, the Party organizations at all levels in the province still have some problems in the united front work: that is, a considerable number of comrades do not understand the Party's united front policy from the perspective of the overall line and overall policy. They believe that united front work is only the work of a few people within the Party; they do not understand that strengthening the united front work is of decisive significance for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. For example, some conferences of people's representatives or people's congresses convened in some places are still somewhat formalistic; many Party cadres still lack a democratic work style; some Party cadres do not actively unite with and help democratic friends in the industrial and commercial sectors, the education sector, and the religious sector, thus affecting the progress of national construction.
    A considerable number of Party cadres and non-Party cadres have not yet established the idea of relying on the working class.
    (2) In the past year, with the recovery and development of public and private enterprises, the working class in the province has not only continuously increased in number, but also significantly improved in their level of consciousness and organization. Whether it is from the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement, or from the Provincial Congress of Model Workers in Industry and Agriculture and the Industrial Exhibition held last year, the leading role of the working class can be seen. However, it should be strictly pointed out that a considerable number of Party cadres and non-Party cadres have not yet established the idea of relying on the working class. This is manifested in the relatively weak trade union work in various factories, mines, etc., the insufficient implementation of the policy of democratic factory management, and the insufficient emphasis placed by leaders at all levels on training and promoting worker cadres. In particular, the entire Party and all cadres have not universally paid attention to the Trade Union Law and the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the Central People's Government, which will affect the发挥 [fā huī: bring into play] of the leading role of the working class.
    (3) After the end of the land reform in the province, the rural political environment and class relations have undergone a fundamental change. In the past year, we have concentrated our efforts on doing one major thing – educating farmers to overcome utopian agricultural socialist ideas and implementing the rural production direction of combining organization and improved technology. This has led to a new situation in many rural areas: on the one hand, the lives of farmers are gradually becoming prosperous; on the other hand, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has also begun to produce a new batch of typical examples. These typical examples show that after mutual aid teams are closely combined with improved technology, development of sideline production, and supply and marketing cooperatives, it has indeed proven to have great advantages over the individual economy. Undoubtedly, at present, a thriving new atmosphere is increasingly growing in the countryside, both economically and culturally. However, on the other hand, under the current new international and domestic political situation, the serious weaknesses of farmers as small producers have also been clearly exposed: politically, they cannot see the existence of domestic and foreign enemies, nor can they see that the landlords who have been overthrown have not resigned themselves to failure and are still attempting to counterattack the farmers at all times, thus leading to ideological麻痹 [má bì: numbness], and松懈 [sōng xiè: relaxation] in fighting spirit. Economically, because they cannot see the overall national and collective long-term interests of the farmers, some people have shown a blind spontaneous phenomenon of not wanting leadership in production; or there are still remnants of utopian agricultural socialist ideas. These situations are directly reflected in the Party's rural grassroots organizations, so many Party cadres have generated passive "退坡" [tuì pō: literally "retreating downhill," implying a slackening of effort and enthusiasm] ideas. Since they cannot see the enemy, they will certainly not pay attention to the work of uniting friends. Since they are blinded by a spontaneous production perspective, they certainly cannot play a proper exemplary role in mutual aid teams, nor can they play the leading role of the proletariat vanguard for the farmers. This is the focus of the current rural problem. As for the general new area rural areas, because the land reform did not completely crush the arrogance of the landlord class, the advantages of the farmers have not yet been established in many places, and the boundaries between farmers and landlords have not been completely clarified. In short, whether it is in the old or new areas, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The serious problem is to educate the peasants," and education is urgently needed. Who will educate them? Of course, only our Party can, so implementing Party consolidation work is of particular importance at present.
    The American and Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gangs' special agents are constantly trying to seize the fruits of the people's victory.
    (4) What is the enemy's situation? Throughout the country, American imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gangs, spread dozens of types of special agent organizations, who are constantly using Yiguandao, bandits, despots, unlawful landlords, and unreformed scattered military officers to spread rumors, sabotage, and plot rebellions, attempting to seize the fruits of the people's victory. After the outbreak of the American imperialist aggression against Korea last year, they believed that the time had come and carried out sabotage everywhere in various ways. Because we were ideologically麻痹 [má bì: numbness] inside and outside the Party, we once fought some losing battles and suffered a lot in the struggle against rumors and sabotage. The enemy's sinful actions have taught us that the struggle with counter-revolutionaries is a long and arduous struggle. This struggle must not only resolutely strike the head, that is, severely suppress the leaders; but also thoroughly dig up the roots, that is, eradicate the social roots of special agent activities. This requires first raising the revolutionary vigilance of the entire people; at the same time, it is necessary to completely ban secret societies and reform all landlords and scattered military officers. Only in this way will special agents be easily isolated among the people, and they can be eliminated by the power of the people.
    Firmly relying on the working class and strengthening education for farmers is the basic key to completing various tasks.

    Based on the above analysis, Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said in his summary that the basic principles that must be followed in the current work are: firmly relying on the working class, strengthening education for farmers, constantly guiding them to revolutionize, consolidating the unity of the entire people, and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He also determined that the Party organizations throughout the province must do the following six tasks well in 1951: First, continue to deepen and expand the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement to defend the homeland, paying particular attention to making the movement deeply penetrate into rural areas and all backward corners, so that everyone knows the significance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the homeland, and consciously participate in this movement. In the movement, we must also emphasize the vanguard role of the working class. Second, strengthen the Party's leadership over urban work, further rely on the working class, and do a good job in factory management and trade union work. At the same time, Party cadres must learn to do business in order to strengthen trade cooperation, unite private merchants, connect the domestic market, vigorously promote local products, and supply farmers with the necessary means of production and living. Establish a complete and unified production perspective of production, transportation, and sales. Third, carry out a patriotic agricultural bumper harvest movement. In the old areas, strive to increase production by 10% on the basis of exceeding or approaching pre-war production levels; in the new areas, strive to generally reach pre-war production levels. This requires earnestly implementing the ten policies on agricultural and forestry production promulgated by the Central People's Government, vigorously promoting all advanced experiences of "combining organization and improving technology"; at the same time, in order to adapt to the needs of large-scale industrial construction in the future, gradually and consciously carry out agricultural reorganization. Fourth, thoroughly ban all secret societies, and severely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities in accordance with the decisions and regulations promulgated by the Central People's Government. Strengthen the political work of the public security armed forces and the construction of the military region's people's armed forces to protect social security. Fifth, strengthen cultural and educational work. Appropriately improve the treatment of teachers. Strengthen leadership over news and literary and artistic work. Pay special attention to strengthening the cultural and educational work of workers and peasants and worker-peasant cadres. At the same time, we must be very concerned about maternal and child health and epidemic prevention work, promote people's sports, and improve people's health. Sixth, train and cultivate a large number of cadres in various fields to prepare for large-scale long-term construction in the future. Thoroughly carry out the rectification of the Party's grassroots organizations, and improve the consciousness of Party members politically, ideologically, and organizationally to the level of the proletariat vanguard, in order to further consolidate the Party and improve the Party's combat effectiveness. At the same time, resolutely implement the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network for the masses of the people throughout the Party, and strive to universally establish a propaganda network throughout the Party this year as an urgent and important task in Party building.
    The meeting pointed out that in order to achieve the above tasks, the Party's leading organs at all levels must effectively grasp the "patriotic industrial and agricultural production movement" as the central task of the year. At the same time, we must also pay attention to improving the work system and leadership methods of Party and government at all levels, reduce unnecessary meetings, and ensure that leading cadres and staff within the organs at all levels and systems have at least one-third of their time each year to go down to inspect and help with work. Each leading organ must pay attention to in-depth discovery of typical examples and promptly promote advanced experiences. Regularly and periodically conduct collective reports and research on work situations, and report the results to higher levels at any time.
    Finally, the meeting unanimously passed four resolutions on preparing for the convening of the first Party Congress on September 1 this year, on universally establishing a propaganda network for the masses of the people in all levels of organizations throughout the Party in 1951, on strengthening the work of training and cultivating cadres, and on strengthening the work of the people's armed forces.

    一九五一年山西省的工作
    ——记山西省第二次党员代表会议
    全面分析情况是确定各项任务的必要基础
    中共山西省委会于二月十六日在太原市召开了第二次党代表会议。到会代表与列席者共七百零五人。中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛同志亲临大会作政治报告。这次会议使代表感到印象最深的是针对目前全省各阶级各阶层的状况进行了全面的政治分析，尖锐地提出了目前实际工作中存在着的问题，并在这个基础上，指出与阐明了一九五一年党所面临的各项任务。这样使大家在思想上明确了几个根本的观念：反对美帝国主义，与热爱祖国的政治教育是推动各项工作的动力；必须把经济建设与政治斗争密切地结合起来；学会作生意是完整的生产观点的一部分；党的统一战线政策与镇压反革命政策是互相统一的，是必须坚决贯彻执行的政策。
    大会是怎样进行政治分析的呢？开始，各地区的代表团，都根据政治报告和去年工作总结与今年工作任务的报告，普遍分析检查了本地区的工作，提出了工作中存在的问题，并研究了解决办法。最后由省委书记赖若愚同志把意见归纳为：
    （一）目前全省统一战线从总的方面看来，各阶级人民团结的气氛空前增涨。这是由于过去一年中，全省普遍召开了各级人民代表会议或人民代表大会；坚决地执行了中央人民政府关于统一财政工作的决定，以及平稳物价、调整工商业的政策；尤其是从去年后半年全省开展了抗美援朝保家卫国运动，因此四个阶级的团结巩固与扩大了。但是全省各级党的组织在统一战线工作上还存在着一些问题：就是还有相当多的同志，没有从总路线总政策的意义上去了解党的统一战线政策，他们认为统一战线工作，只是党内少数人的工作；不了解加强统一战线工作，对于巩固人民民主专政是有决定意义的。譬如有些地方召开的各界代表会议或人民代表大会还有些形式；很多党员干部民主作风还很不够；有些党员干部对工商界、教育界、宗教界的民主朋友主动地团结与帮助他们不够，因而影响到国家建设事业的进行。
    相当多的党员干部和非党干部还没有树立起依靠工人阶级思想
    （二）全省工人阶级在去年一年中，随着公私企业的恢复与发展，不仅数量不断地增长，而且他们的觉悟程度与组织程度也有显著地提高。无论从抗美援朝运动中、或去年举行的全省工农业劳动模范大会和工业展览会中，都可以看到工人阶级的领导作用。但是，应当严格地指出：还有相当多的党员干部和非党干部，还没有树立起依靠工人阶级的思想。这表现在各工厂、矿场等的工会工作比较薄弱，工厂管理民主化方针贯彻得不够，各级领导对培养与提拔工人干部还重视不够。特别是全党与全体干部还没有普遍注意中央人民政府颁布的工会法与劳动保险条例，这会影响到发挥工人阶级的领导作用。
    （三）全省土地改革结束之后，农村的政治环境和阶级关系，起了一个根本的变化。去年一年中，我们集中力量做了一件大事——教育农民克服空想的农业社会主义思想，贯彻了组织起来与提高技术相结合的农村生产方向，由此使许多农村，出现了一种新的情况，一方面农民生活逐渐富裕，一方面互助合作运动也开始产生一批新的典型。这种典型说明互助组与提高技术，发展副业生产，并与供销合作社密切结合起来之后，确实证明它比个体经济具有极大的优越性。无疑的，目前农村中，无论在经济上、文化上都日益滋长着欣欣向荣的新气象。但是另一方面，在目前国际国内新的政治形势下，也很清楚地暴露了农民小生产者的严重弱点：他们在政治上看不见国内外敌人的存在，看不见已被打倒的地主阶级并未甘心失败、仍然时刻企图向农民反攻，因而思想麻痹、斗志松懈。在经济上由于他们看不见整个国家的以及农民集体的长远利益，因而在生产上有些人表现了不要领导的盲目自发现象；或者仍然存在着空想的农业社会主义思想的残余。这些情况又直接反映到党的农村基层组织内，因而不少党员干部产生了消极“退坡”思想。他们既然目无敌人，当然就不会重视团结朋友的工作。他们既然被自发性的生产观点所蒙蔽，当然在互助组中就不能起应有的模范作用，就不能起无产阶级先锋队对农民的领导作用。这就是目前农村问题的焦点。至于一般新区农村，由于土地改革中，没有彻底把地主阶级的气焰打垮，因此很多地方农民的优势还没有确立起来，农民和地主的界限还没有完全划清楚。总之无论老区或新区，正如毛主席所指示的“严重的问题在于教育农民”，都迫切地需要进行教育的。谁去教育呢？当然只有靠我们的党，因此贯彻整党工作，在目前就有特别重要的意义。
    美国与蒋阎匪帮的特务时刻想夺取人民胜利果实
    （四）敌人的情况是怎样的呢？在全国，美帝国主义与其走狗蒋阎匪帮散播有数十种名目的特务组织，他们时刻在利用一贯道、惯匪、恶霸、不法地主、和没经过改造的流散军官造谣破坏、阴谋叛乱，企图夺取人民的胜利果实。去年美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争爆发后，他们认为时机已到，到处用各种方式进行捣乱。而我们由于党内外思想麻痹，曾经有一个时期，在反谣言反破坏的斗争上打了一些败仗，吃了不少亏。敌人的罪恶行为教育了我们：和反革命的斗争，是一个长期艰巨的斗争。这个斗争不仅要坚决地打头，就是严厉镇压为首者；同时还要彻底地挖根，就是铲除特务活动的社会根源。这就要首先提高全体人民群众的革命警惕性；同时必须彻底取缔会道门，改造所有地主和流散军官。只有这样，特务才容易在人民中孤立，并用人民的力量把他们消灭。
    坚决依靠工人阶级，加强对农民教育，是完成各项任务的基本关键
    根据以上分析，省委书记赖若愚同志在总结时说，目前工作中必须遵循的基本原则是：坚决依靠工人阶级，加强对农民的教育，不断地引导他们革命化，巩固地团结全体人民，坚决镇压反革命。并确定了一九五一年全省党的组织必须作好以下六项工作：第一、继续深入与扩大抗美援朝保家卫国运动，特别注意使运动深入到农村和一切落后角落，使人人都知道抗美援朝保家卫国的意义，自觉地参加这一运动。在运动中并强调工人阶级的先锋作用。第二、加强党对城镇工作的领导，进一步依靠工人阶级，作好工厂管理与工会工作。同时党员干部要学会作生意，以便加强贸易合作工作，团结私商，沟通国内市场，大力推销土产，供给农民必需的生产资料与生活资料。树立生产、运输、推销的完整统一的生产观点。第三、开展爱国主义农业丰产运动，老区争取在超过或接近战前生产水平的基础上，普遍增产一成；新区争取普遍达到战前生产水平。这就必须认真地贯彻中央人民政府颁布的农林生产十项政策，大力推广“组织起来与提高技术相结合”的一切先进经验；同时为适应今后大规模工业建设的需要，逐步有意识地进行农业改组工作。第四、彻底取缔一切会道门，依照中央人民政府颁布的决定和条例，严厉镇压一切反革命的活动。加强公安武装的政治工作与军区人民武装的建设，以保卫社会治安。第五、加强文化教育工作。适当的改善教师的待遇。加强对新闻和文学艺术工作的领导。特别注意加强工农群众与工农干部的文化教育工作。同时要十分关心妇婴卫生及防疫工作，提倡人民体育运动，增进人民健康。第六、大量训练与培养各方面干部，以准备今后大规模长期建设。贯彻进行整顿党的基层组织，从政治上、思想上、组织上提高党员的觉悟程度到无产阶级先锋队的水平上来，以便进一步巩固党，提高党的战斗力。同时坚决执行中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，争取在今年内在全党普遍建立起宣传网，作为在党的建设中一项迫切的重要的工作任务。
    会议指出为要实现以上各项任务，各级党的领导机关，必须切实掌握“开展爱国主义的工农业的生产运动”这个全年中心任务。同时还必须注意改进各级党和政府的工作制度和领导方法，减少不必要的会议，保证各级各系统的领导干部及机关内的工作人员，全年至少须有三分之一的时间，下去检查和帮助工作。每个领导机关均须注意深入发现典型，并及时推广先进经验。经常定期集体汇报和研究工作情况，并随时将结果报送上级。
    会议最后一致通过了关于准备今年九月一日召开第一届党代表大会、关于在全党的各级组织于一九五一年内普遍建立对人民群众的宣传网、关于加强培养训练干部工作、关于加强人民武装工作等四个决议案。
