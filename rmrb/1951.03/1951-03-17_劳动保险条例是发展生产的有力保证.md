    The Labor Insurance Regulations are a Powerful Guarantee for Developing Production
    To the Editor:
    After the promulgation of the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China", all employees expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the government for this measure to protect the interests of workers. Everyone unanimously believes that this regulation is another major law to protect the interests of workers after the promulgation of the "Trade Union Law", a great good news for the working class, and a powerful guarantee for workers to better develop production. The Beijing West Mining Bureau and the Beijing West Coal Mine Trade Union have recently organized workers to study this major law.

    劳动保险条例是发展生产的有力保证编辑同志：
    “中华人民共和国劳动保险条例”公布后，全体职工对政府这种保护工人利益的措施，表示衷心感谢。大伙一致认为：这个条例是“工会法”颁布后又一个保护工人利益的大法，是工人阶级的大喜讯，是使工人能更好地发展生产的有力保证。在京西矿务局和京西煤矿工会，最近已组织工人学习这一大法。
