　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 14th: The French Communist Party passed a resolution on the 13th, saluting the workers of Barcelona who are fighting against the Franco regime.

　　The resolution stated: Through the general strike and mass actions of the people against high prices and insufficient wages, the workers of Barcelona are giving a heavy blow to the bloody fascist dictatorship. The Barcelona events prove the growing strength of the Spanish workers and people's movement and demonstrate the heroic spirit of the Spanish people, which has been demonstrated many times before.

　　The resolution continued: The Barcelona events prove that it is not so easy for the American imperialists to turn Spain into a base for atomic warfare. The Franco regime, which is starving workers and other sections of the people, is preparing to give refuge to the old French traitor Pétain. Therefore, the current regime in Spain is an enemy of the French people, just as it is an enemy of the Spanish people.

　　The resolution pointed out: Supporting the struggle of Barcelona and all of Spain is in the interests of the French people. The French people must prevent any war materials from being transported to Spain and stop any aid from reaching this fascist and war regime. It is necessary to protect the Spanish Republicans who have taken refuge in France and are currently being persecuted by Queuille (Minister of the Interior) and Domerc (French police chief) merely because they oppose fascism.

　　The resolution concluded: "Long live the solidarity of the workers and the two great nations of France and Spain in the struggle against the warmongers and their fascist lackeys!"

　　法国共产党通过决议
    向巴塞罗那工人致敬
    号召人民支持全西班牙人民的斗争
    【新华社十五日讯】电通社巴黎十四日讯：法国共产党十三日通过一项决议，向正与佛朗哥政权斗争的巴塞罗那工人致敬。
    决议称：巴塞罗那的工人通过为反对高昂的物价和不足糊口的工资而举行的总罢工和人民的群众性行动，正给予血腥的法西斯独裁以沉重的打击。巴塞罗那事件证明了西班牙工人和人民运动的力量日益壮大，显示了以前曾多次表现过的西班牙人民的英雄气概。
    决议继称：巴塞罗那事件证明美帝国主义者要想把西班牙变为原子战争的基地是并不那么容易的。使工人及其他阶层人民受饥挨饿的佛朗哥政权正准备给法国的老卖国贼贝当以庇身之地。因此，西班牙的现政权是法国人民的敌人，正如它是西班牙人民的敌人一样。
    决议指出：支持巴塞罗那和全西班牙的斗争是符合法兰西人民的利益的。法国人民必需防止任何战争物资运往西班牙，并阻止任何援助到达这个法西斯与战争的政权。必须保护在法国避难而目前仅仅因为他们反对法西斯而受到葛义（内政部长）和多马（法国警察头子）的迫害的西班牙共和人士。
    决议在结语称：“法兰西和西班牙两国的工人们和两大民族在反对战争贩子和他们的法西斯走狗的斗争中的团结万岁！”
