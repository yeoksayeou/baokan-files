Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 3rd: The Secretariat of the All India Students' Federation issued a statement on February 25th, opposing the US imperialists' rearmament of Japan. The statement said: "The Secretariat of the All India Students' Federation expresses extreme indignation and protests against the continued efforts of the US occupation authorities to remilitarize Japan as a springboard for aggression against the people of Asian countries. The Secretariat believes that the re-militarization of Japan is a serious threat to Asian liberation and world peace. The Secretariat expresses its respect for the heroic actions of Japanese students and youth, who, together with other sectors of the Japanese people, are doing their best to oppose the re-militarization of their country and the unilateral peace treaty activities carried out by the US occupation authorities. The Secretariat fully supports the decisions of the Second World Peace Congress regarding Japan and advocates for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with various international agreements and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Japan. The Secretariat supports Prime Minister Nehru's statement opposing the rearmament of Japan. The Secretariat urges the Indian government to firmly oppose the re-militarization of Japan and demands the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan with the participation of People's China and the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Japan."
