Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: The National Agricultural Work Conference convened in Beijing by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government concluded on the 26th. This conference summarized the work of 1950, exchanged experiences in agricultural production from various regions, and deeply discussed the "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, enabling representatives from various regions to more clearly understand the approaches to various tasks in this year's agricultural production.

After thirteen days of repeated discussions, the representatives from various regions unanimously agreed that in order to strive for a national bumper harvest this year and lay a good foundation for national economic construction, under the current situation of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, it is necessary to launch a nationwide patriotic production campaign (in old liberated areas, a patriotic bumper harvest campaign) to further enhance the production enthusiasm of farmers across the country and smoothly complete this year's national agricultural production increase tasks.

The conference summarized the experiences of launching agricultural production campaigns across the country last year. Based on these experiences, the conference believes that to launch a nationwide patriotic production campaign this year, it is necessary to focus on several key aspects: First, correctly implement agricultural production policies to stabilize and enhance farmers' production enthusiasm. In order to complete this year's production increase tasks for economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco, various regions can, based on last year's experience, suggest that trade departments make appropriate adjustments to prices, etc., to encourage farmers to plant economic crops in large quantities. Second, continue to implement the policy of organizing to develop production. The conference believes that last year, labor mutual aid organizations in old liberated areas added new content by combining with sideline production and improved technology, which enabled labor mutual aid organizations to develop and consolidate. This year, various regions can study and adopt the above-mentioned experience based on their local conditions. The conference also criticized the past deviations in some areas in organizing labor mutual aid groups, such as coercive orders and relaxed leadership. Third, vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to fight against natural disasters. This struggle must be timely, continuous, and adopt various effective methods to gradually reduce and overcome disasters and ensure this year's bumper harvest. Fourth, launch a mass movement to improve technology. In the future, county, district, and village-level cadres should be trained in a planned way to enable them to master agricultural technology and lead farmers in production. In terms of promoting agricultural technology, various regions should use organizational forms such as rural technical seminars and technical research associations to impart technology to farmers. This method is very effective. In the future, we should strengthen experimental research, unite and improve agricultural technical cadres, and combine scientific technology with mass experience. Fifth, strengthen agricultural production leadership. Leading organs at all levels must establish the guiding ideology that leading agricultural production is the central task of rural work; agricultural departments in various regions must accurately grasp the characteristics of seasonality, region and technology. All newly launched undertakings must be problems that the masses urgently need to solve at present; when undertaking them, they should be carried out steadily to gain experience and then promote them.

The conference also discussed the establishment and improvement of organizational structures, the production of ethnic minorities and closed areas, the management of state-owned farms, agricultural experimental research, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. Preliminary solutions have been obtained for the above-mentioned issues.

　　农业工作会议决定开展爱国生产运动
    争取今年全国丰收
    要为国家的经济建设奠定良好的基础
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府农业部在北京召开的全国农业工作会议，已于二十六日闭幕。这次会议总结了一九五○年的工作，交流了各地农业生产的经验，深入地讨论了中央人民政府政务院关于一九五一年农林生产的决定，使各地代表更加明确认识了今年农业生产中各项工作的做法。
    各地与会代表经过十三天的反复讨论，一致认为，为了争取今年全国的丰收，为国家的经济建设奠定良好的基础，在目前全国抗美援朝的形势下，必须开展一个全国性的爱国生产运动（老区为爱国丰产运动），以便更加提高全国农民的生产情绪，顺利地完成今年全国农业增产任务。
    会议总结了去年全国开展农业生产运动的经验。根据这些经验，会议认为今年开展全国性的爱国生产运动，必须抓紧几个主要的环节：首先是正确贯彻农业生产政策，以稳定与提高农民的生产情绪；为了完成今年棉、麻、烟等经济作物的增产任务，各地可根据去年的经验，建议贸易部门对价格等加以适当的调整，以鼓励农民大量种植经济作物。第二、继续贯彻组织起来发展生产的方针。会议认为，去年老区的劳动互助组织由于和副业生产与改良技术相结合，增添了新的内容，使劳动互助组织获得发展和巩固。今年，各地可根据上述经验并依据当地具体情况加以研究采择。会议对于过去某些地区在组织劳动互助组时的强迫命令和放松领导等偏向，也进行了批判。第三、应大力发动和组织群众向自然灾害作斗争。这种斗争必须是适时地、连续地和采取各种有效的办法，以便逐渐减少和克服灾害，保障今年的丰收。第四、开展群众性的改进技术运动。今后要有计划地训练县、区、村三级干部，使其能掌握农业技术，领导农民进行生产。在推广农业技术方面，各地应利用农村中的技术座谈会、技术研究会等组织形式，向农民传授技术。这种办法是非常有效的。今后应加强试验研究工作，团结与提高农业技术干部，使科学技术与群众经验相结合。第五、加强农业生产领导。各级领导机关要树立领导农业生产是农村工作中的中心任务的指导思想；各地农业部门要准确地掌握季节性、地区性和技术性的特点。一切新举办的事业，必须是目前群众迫切需要解决的问题；在举办时，应稳步地开展，以便取得经验，然后推广。
    会议也讨论了建立与健全组织机构，少数民族与闭塞地区的生产、国营农场管理、农业试验研究工作及畜牧兽医等问题。上述问题均已获得初步的解决。
