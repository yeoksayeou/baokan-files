　　Opinions on Children's Books and Comic Strips
　　The Language and Subject Matter of Children's Books Liu Raomin
　　It is undeniable that there is still a great lack of good children's books. Therefore, everyone urgently requests that children's book writers and elementary school teachers work hard to write more things for children. What issues should be paid attention to in writing? I think at least the following issues should be noted:
　　1. The issue of words and sentences. Children's comprehension ability is generally not high. If we want children to understand the content of our works after reading them and leave an impression in their minds, we must first understand children and learn from them, especially learn children's language. After we have written the work, it is best to take it to the children to read aloud and ask them for their opinions. We need to modify the parts they don't understand; delete what is excessive; and supplement what is lacking. Only stop when they can understand and read it smoothly. This will make the text close to children's spoken language and make children love to read. Children often cannot accept the words and sentences in existing children's books. For example, in the book "The Monkey Who Played with Fire" published by Shandong Xinhua Bookstore, there is an article called "The Elephant and the Little Snake," in which there is a sentence "It is both lamentable and pitiful." Many fifth-grade elementary school students also feel it is awkward and difficult to understand. They reflect: "Such sentences are really awkward, and it just doesn't feel right!"
　　Regarding the length and style of the work, it is also worth noting by children's book authors. According to my survey of children around ten years old (fourth and fifth grade students), they like works of about 400-500 to 1,500 words the most. In terms of genre, they generally like poetry and fairy tales, and hate preachy essays the most.
　　2. What to write about. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, many children's book writers, on the one hand, had to inspire and cultivate children's sense of justice and fighting spirit, and on the other hand, had to escape the reactionaries' "censorship gate." Therefore, they often used "bird and animal language" to make symbols and metaphors. In the new society, writers can freely use various direct methods to educate children. Children cannot be satisfied with bird and animal language. What they love most is "real people and real events" works that write about the model activities of the children themselves. According to the children: "Reading 'Timur and His Team' and 'Little Hero' and 'Chicken Feather Letter' is much better than reading 'Animal Kingdom' and 'Gulliver's Travels,' because they are interesting and can educate themselves!"
　　Editor's note: It is true that children like to read "real people and real events" works that write about the model activities of the children themselves, and this aspect of works should be greatly promoted. However, excellent "bird and animal language" also has its meaning and value for children.
　　Hopes for Several Children's Periodicals Li Benzhao
　　The fonts in periodicals for children are generally too small, mostly using No. 5 or small No. 5 fonts; the spacing between lines and between words is also too crowded, similar to books for ordinary adults. This phenomenon is more serious in: "New Young Pioneers" in Dalian, "Good Children" in Shenyang, "Kaiming Young Pioneers" in Beijing, and "Chongqing Young Pioneers and Children." An article in the second issue of "Chongqing Young Pioneers and Children" even used No. 6 font. The spacing between lines in "Chinese Young Pioneers and Children" is relatively large, but the font is still a bit small. In order to protect children's eyesight and take care of the health of the next generation of the country, I suggest that children's periodicals should be printed in small No. 4 font, with a spacing of 1/10 to 1.5/10 of a foot between lines.
　　Poor printing and blurry illustrations are also common phenomena in children's periodicals. Illustrations are a powerful aid to help children read. The printing of children's periodicals must be very clear. In this regard, the Commercial Press's "New Children's World" does a better job.
　　Suggestions for the Book Reading Room Liu Rucun
　　I visited the Beijing No. 15 Book and Newspaper Reading Room (Dongba Town). There are many books on display that suit the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is very good. However, I also found that some of the content of the comic books there are problematic. For example: "The Crow's Accusation" tells the story of an adulterer who killed his wife's husband and threw the body into a well. The case was solved because the crows were noisy; "New Arabian Nights" (movie story) is full of fantasy, promoting magic, violence, force, and pornography; "Selflessness" is about a landlord's son leading peasants to fight against his evil landlord father. The theme is not bad, but the pictures are too bad; "The Earth Returns to Spring" (movie story) alludes to the Kuomintang's "saving the country by a devious path" in the War of Resistance against Japan, plus pornography, praising it as "underground struggle," resulting in an inexplicable ending; "Butterfly Lovers" is even more vulgar. In short, these are all vulgar materials that cater to low-level tastes and are of no benefit or even harmful to the people. Therefore, I want to suggest to the comrades in charge of book reading and literary and social education: We should clearly recognize that the work of book promotion is to serve the people correctly, and we must be particularly careful in selecting books to buy. In addition, I would like to make two suggestions: First, we must combine book reading with current affairs and policies, increase and vigorously recommend popular books on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, as well as positive things such as natural science, social services, and production construction, to correctly promote the proper role of book promotion. Second, we must always pay attention to understanding active readers, further unite and consolidate them, become the backbone of reading, and organize and cultivate them into powerful assistants for publicizing and educating the masses and developing business.
　　Editor's note: Comrade Liu Rucun's suggestion is very good. The situation he pointed out at the Beijing No. 15 Book and Newspaper Reading Room should attract the attention and inspection of comrades working in cultural palaces, libraries, rural small libraries, and urban reading rooms in various places.
　　Strengthen the Political and Ideological Nature of Comic Strips Hu Bao
　　I am a middle school student. After reading the words "Comic strips are also loved by them (especially junior high school students)" in Tu Shuping's "Middle School Students' Opinions on Publications" in the seventh issue of "Book and Newspaper Review," I considered it. In our school (Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School No. 2), a large number of students like to read comic strips, but there are also a few students who do not like to read them. I am one of the least fond of them. The reasons are: personal preference is one reason, but more importantly, the political and ideological nature of the currently published comic strips is too low, and some even lack artistic quality. Therefore, I hope that comic strip creators will create more comic strips with political and ideological content and higher political and ideological content.
　　The Font, Binding, and Cover of Comic Strips Li Chunjiao
　　The content of comic strips involves a wide range, so I will not talk about it for the time being, but only express some opinions on the font, binding, and cover.
　　1. The font size of the explanatory text is a matter of concern. In terms of font alone, most of the comic strips currently published use old No. 5, new No. 5, and No. 6 fonts; some do not even add empty leads between lines, densely packed, black and blurry. This not only makes it very difficult for some readers with lower levels of education to read, but also damages their eyesight. If readers can benefit from our comic strips, but on the other hand, suffer irreparable losses in their eyesight, then the gain is not worth the loss. Therefore, I think the smallest font should not be smaller than No. 4 or new No. 4 font. If you want to use old No. 5 font, there must be appropriate spacing between the lines. New No. 5 and No. 6 fonts should never be used.
　　2. The binding is not strong. If a popular book is to be read by ten people, then a comic strip will be read by dozens or hundreds of people. However, today's comic strips are still bound in the same way as ordinary books and periodicals, and some even use only one wire staple. Wire staples are inherently easy to rust, and using only one staple is even worse. In addition, the cover paper is too thin, and the cover will soon fall off and the text will be lost. Therefore, it is best to use a sewing machine to sew the binding, and use glue instead of paste to glue the spine. In this way, it will only cost a few more kilograms of millet per 10,000 pages, but the life of the book can be extended. The cover should naturally be as strong as possible.
　　3. Some cover designs are too bad. Due to the shortage of comic strip manuscripts, some publishers reprint entire sets of movie stills into books, which is not necessarily a bad thing. However, some of these movie contents are very incorrect, and some comic books also choose scenes of men and women snuggling together in the movies, or very terrifying scenes, as the cover. This is very bad. Do we still want to use this to attract readers today? Of course, there are still some backward readers who like these things, but we should never cater to readers in this way, because this is not the real "need" of the masses.
　　Editor's note: Comrades Li Benzhao and Li Chunjiao raised the issue of the font size used in children's books and comic strips, and hope that publishers will pay attention. Currently, general books and periodicals have the disadvantage of fonts being too small, and especially the reading materials of children and adolescents and popular reading materials should absolutely avoid fonts that are too small.

### 关于儿童读物和连环画的意见

专栏：

　　关于儿童读物和连环画的意见
    儿童读物的语言和题材  刘饶民
    毋庸讳言，目前良好的儿童读物还很缺乏，因此大家迫切要求儿童读物作家们、小学教师们努力为孩子们多编写些东西出来。在写作中应当注意些什么问题呢？我认为起码应当注意下面这几个问题：
    一、词句的问题  儿童的理解力一般还不高，要想使儿童看了我们的作品就能领会它的内容，在脑中留下印象，那首先就得了解儿童，向儿童学习，特别要学习儿童的语言。我们把作品写好后，最好拿到儿童面前去朗读，请他们发表意见。他们听不懂的地方得修改；那里多了什么就得删去，欠缺了什么就得补充。直到他们听得懂，读得顺口，才住手。这样就可以使文字接近儿童的口语，使儿童爱读。现有的儿童读物，在词句上，儿童们多不能接受，例如山东新华书店出版的《玩火的猴子》一书里有一篇叫“大象和小蛇”的文章，其中有一句是“可叹亦复可怜”，好多五年级的小学生也感到生硬难懂，他们反映：“这样句子真别扭，看着就是不得劲！”
    关于作品的篇幅和文体，也值得儿童读物作者注意。据我调查十岁左右（四五年级学生）的儿童，他们最喜欢四五百字至一千五百字左右的作品。在体裁方面，一般都喜欢诗歌及童话，顶讨厌的是说教式的论文。
    二、写什么东西的问题  在国民党反动派统治时期，有好多儿童读物的作家们，一方面要启发培养孩子们的正义感和斗争精神，同时又要逃避反动派的“检查关”，所以常常借用“鸟言兽语”来作象征和比喻。现在新社会里，作家可以完全自由地用各种直接的方式来进行对儿童的教育。孩子们对鸟言兽语是不能满足的。他们最喜爱的是写孩子们自己的模范活动的“真人真事”的作品。据孩子们说：“读《铁木耳及其伙伴》和《小英雄》、《鸡毛信》，要比看《兽国记》、《大人国游记》强得多，因为它们有意思，可以教育自己！”  
    编者按：儿童喜欢看“写孩子们自己模范活动的‘真人真事’的作品”那是不错的，应该大大提倡这一方面的作品。可是优良的“鸟言兽语”，对儿童也有它的意义和价值的。
            对几种儿童刊物的希望  李本昭
    供儿童阅读的期刊，一般的字体都太小了，常用的大多是五号字或小五号字；行与行之间、字与字之间也排得太挤了，和普通成年人看的书差不多。这个现象比较严重的是：大连的“新少年”、沈阳的“好孩子”、北京的“开明少年”和“重庆少年儿童”。“重庆少年儿童”第二期上有一篇文章，竟用了六号字。“中国少年儿童”，行与行之间的空隙虽然比较大些，可是字体究竟嫌小了一点。为了保护儿童目力，照顾国家下一代的健康，我建议儿童刊物应当用小四号字排，行与行之间的间隔为市尺的一分至一分半。
    印刷不精，插图模糊，也是儿童类期刊中普遍存在的现象。插图，是帮助儿童阅读的有力辅助。儿童类期刊的印刷一定要非常清楚。在这方面，商务印书馆的“新儿童世界”做得比较好。
            对图书阅览室的建议  刘儒存
    我曾参观过北京市第十五书报阅览室（东坝镇），那里陈列的图书适合工农兵兴趣的很多，这是很好的。但也发现其中有些连环画册内容还有问题的。例如：《乌鸦告状》，讲的奸夫杀害本夫，投尸井里，因乌鸦叫噪被追查破案的故事；《新天方夜谈》（电影故事），是想入非非，宣扬神奇、狂暴、武力、色情的东西；“大公无私”，写地主儿子领导农民斗恶霸地主父亲，题材并不坏，但是画面太坏；《大地回春》（电影故事），影射国民党抗战中“曲线救国”的把戏，加上色情，美其名为“地下斗争”，弄出个莫明其妙的收场；“蝶恋花”，更是庸俗的故事。总之，这些都是取材庸俗，迎合低级趣味，对人民毫无好处甚至有害的东西。因此，我要向图书阅览与文艺社教的工作同志建议：我们应明确认识图书推广工作是正确地为人民服务的工作，选购读物要特别慎重。此外我还要提出两点意见：第一，要把图书阅读工作和时事政策等方面结合起来，增加并大力推荐大众化的抗美援朝的读物和自然科学、社会服务、生产建设等积极性的东西，来正确发扬图书推广工作的应有作用。第二，要经常留心了解积极的读者，进一步团结巩固他们，成为读书骨干，组织培养成为宣传教育群众和开展业务的有力助手。
    编者按：刘儒存同志的建议是很好的。他指出的北京市第十五书报阅览室的情形应该引起各地文化宫、图书馆、农村小型图书室和城市阅览室的工作同志们的注意和检查。
            加强连环画的政治性思想性  胡宝
    我是一个中学生。读了“书报评论”第七号内涂树平写的“中学生对出版物的意见”一文中“连环画也是他们（特别是初中学生）所爱好的”等语后，我考虑了一下。在我们学校（北京师大附中二部）很大一部分同学爱看连环画，可是也有少数同学不爱看，我就是最不爱看的一个。其原因：个人的喜爱是一个原因，但更重要的还是目前所出版的连环画的政治性、思想性太低了，有的甚至连艺术性也不够。所以我希望连环画制作者多创造些有政治思想内容的和政治思想内容较高的连环画出来。
            连环画的字体、装订与封面  厉春蛟
    连环画的内容问题牵涉很广，我暂且不谈，只就字体、装订、封面上发表一些意见。
    一、说明文字的字体大小是值得注意的问题。单就字体来说，目前出版的连环画里，用的多半是老五号，新五号和六号字；有的在行间连空铅也不加，密密层层，黑糊糊一条、一片。这样，不但让文化低的一些读者看起来非常吃力，而且会损害他们的目力。如果说读者能从我们的连环画里受到一些益处，可是另一方面在视力上却受到了不可挽救的损失，那就得不偿失了。因此，我认为字体最小的不应小于四号字或新四号字，如果要用老五号字，也必须在行间有适当空隙，新五号字、六号字绝对不应该使用。
    二、装订不坚固，如果说一本通俗读物，要有十个人传看的话，那一本连环画就会有几十人或百多人看，可是今天连环画在装订上，却仍用普通书刊同样的订法，甚至有只用一铁丝钉的。铁丝钉本来就易锈坏，只用一个钉就更糟糕，再加以封皮纸太薄，很快的就会有封皮脱落、正文散失的情形。因此装订最好用缝纫机穿线，糊书脊不要用浆糊而要用粘胶。这样每万页只需多花费几斤小米，便可使书的寿命延长了。封面自然也应当尽量求其牢固。
    三、有些封面设计太恶劣  由于连环画的稿荒，有些出版家将电影画片整套的翻印成书，这并不一定是件坏事。可是这些电影内容有的是很不正确的，有些小人书还将电影里男女相偎，或是很恐怖的场面选作了封面。这就非常恶劣。难道我们今天还要用这一套来吸引读者吗？固然，在目前还有些落后读者喜欢这些东西，可是我们是绝不应该这样去迁就读者，因为这并不是群众真正的“需要”。
    编者按：李本昭与厉春蛟二位同志提出儿童读物与连环画本上所用字体大小的问题，希望出版家注意。目前一般书刊均有字体太小的缺点，尤其儿童少年的读物和通俗读物更应绝对避免太小的字体。
