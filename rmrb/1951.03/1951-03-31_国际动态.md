    The statement declared: The Communist Party will put forward its own candidates in all states of Australia. The statement called on voters to vote for the Communist Party candidates.

    Brazilian Communist Party Calls for the Establishment of a United Front
    The National Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party recently held a meeting to discuss the political situation in Brazil and the party's political and strategic line, and passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a broad national democratic liberation front to oppose war preparations and oppose the ruling class's policy of making Brazil increasingly subordinate to American imperialism. The resolution emphasized that the struggle for peace is the party's central task at present. The resolution called on the entire party to first participate in the general struggle against warmongers, against sending 20,000 Brazilians to Korea, against increasing military appropriations, and against the new conscription law, and to combine the struggle for peace with the daily demands of the broad masses and other struggles.
