　　On the Road Southward

            (I)
    At the end of 1950, thousands of Chinese People's Volunteer Army's advancing spearheads crossed the icy rivers and snowy mountains of North Korea, heading straight for the 38th parallel. At that time, we could also hear the imperialists hypocritically calling for a so-called "ceasefire" on the battlefield radio's loudspeakers. But we witnessed with our own eyes the imperialists setting fire to the land of Korea. In the darkness of night, North Korea's beautiful forests were set ablaze by airplanes, like countless fire dragons rolling through the mountains. In northern Korea, every village we saw was on fire, scaring even the speechless children who didn't know what terror meant to cry. Once, from a mountain position within a sight range of less than twenty meters, I saw three people running out of a house being set on fire by a plane: an old man, and a woman pulling a child. The two people collapsed just after falling out of the flames. The old man touched them, saw that they could no longer be saved, and covered them with a piece of torn mat before running away. Before leaving, he warmed his feet on the fire. All his family property could now give him was this bit of "warmth." Another night, in a small house with a steel helmet covering an oil lamp, a twenty-five-year-old People's Army fighter, Comrade Cui Guanghong, chatted with me. He said that their squad had a total of thirteen people, all hoping to go to China after defeating the American devils. "We are all people without any ties. Our families have all been destroyed by American planes and cannons, and our relatives are all dead!" As he spoke, he lowered his head, his eyes filled with tears. ... For such soldiers, for every comrade in our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army who witnessed the heinous crimes of American imperialism, we will never believe that American imperialism would truly "ceasefire" with them. They bravely advanced southward, determined to take revenge on the enemy, defend and rebuild their happy homes.
            (II)
    We crossed the Qingchuan River on a night in early winter. Near Jiachuan, on both sides of the road, was the battlefield where the American army and its accomplice, the Turkish brigade, were annihilated three days ago. Hundreds of good or bad cars, various types of cannons and tanks, were scattered in all directions. These products of American factories had now been brought to Korea by their own people as a greeting gift to our Volunteer Army.
    The car drove towards Decheon. The road spiraled on a high mountain 1,300 meters above sea level, looking like a white jade belt wrapped around the mountain during the day. Heavy snow flew in the night sky, and the northwest wind howled. The car drove slowly with its lights off, and only saw wooden signs painted with exclamation marks (indicating danger) or "Z" shapes (indicating sharp turns in the road) when we got close. At the gap of the highest peak, a damaged ten-wheeled American military truck blocked the road. We couldn't move it, so we could only cut a road through the mountain. I jumped out of the car and felt like I was stepping on a piece of wood. I shined a flashlight and saw that it was the leg of an American soldier's corpse. The other leg diverged from it in a figure-eight shape on either side of a wheel. This young American soldier was wearing a scarf, had just shaved his beard, and his yellow curly hair was scattered on the snow. He opened his bloody mouth, letting snowflakes drift into his throat. From the fine notebook in his pocket, we found a woman's photo, not knowing who she was to him, only that it was written on the back in English: "Dear, when will you come back? She is waiting day and night!" ... Her "Dear" will never return. Now we can only tell this American wife or Miss: Your "Dear" has died in the snowy winter night on the desolate mountains of North Korea, as cannon fodder for the benefit of American monopoly capitalists.
            (III)
    The villagers in the battlefield area were all refugees who had just returned. They braved the wind and dew, were displaced, and each had their own stories of blood and tears. We don't need to go around interviewing and investigating, just look at these two landlord families in front of us. One family: an old woman with three girls, her son joined the People's Army, and the old woman even showed us the photo of this young fighter. Her house, food, wardrobe, all burned to ashes by an American gasoline bomb. Now the family of four is living in the neighbor's house. The other family, the owner of this house, is an old couple in their sixties or seventies; there is also a daughter-in-law with three children, the oldest being less than five years old. The son was captured by the Americans, and the daughter-in-law just returned from her parents' home yesterday. She originally heard that her husband had escaped back, but when she came back and saw that he wasn't there, she immediately burst into tears. She is only in her twenties. If her husband really doesn't come back, it will be really difficult for her to support this old and young family!
    One night, we went to a house by the side of the road to wait for a car. This family's women and children were crowded all over the floor. But when the translator explained our intention, they enthusiastically cleared a space. The casual conversation turned into complaints. An old woman said that the Chinese Volunteer Army was so kind and so good that she had never seen anything like it. She said that three days ago, the Americans and Turks had just retreated from here, and those people were all beasts. They grabbed all the women over the age of thirteen or fourteen and touched their breasts one by one to see if milk came out. Only the old ones who no longer produced milk were released, and all the other women who did not have time to escape were ravaged by the beasts. She declared: These words were originally unspeakable, but hatred had burned her heart, and seeing us, these relatives, she said it all without any concern. Another young woman said that she was a newly married girl, now a labor party member, and the chairman of the village youth organization. Her husband went to guide the Volunteer Army tonight. When the enemy occupied this place, the Americans captured her husband and ordered him to hand over his newlywed wife within three days. But he did not give in and prepared to sacrifice himself; and on the third morning, the Volunteer Army came. The enemy fled in a panic, and her husband ran home.
            (IV)
    Last October was the most difficult day for North Korea. The enemy was about to reach the Yalu River. At that time, we had just left our motherland and arrived at the Korean front line. We often encountered groups of people fleeing from their burning homes on the roads very close to the enemy, taking refuge in the deep mountains. The elderly sighed all the way; women in white clothes and white skirts carried children on their backs, with large bundles on their heads, following behind. They remained silent, silently remembering this deep hatred in their hearts. Comrades of the People's Army came down from the front and shook hands with us tightly, showing excitement and sadness in their hearts. How many families were separated, how many people lived in blood and tears day and night. ... But when the enemy was driven from the Qingchuan River to the 38th parallel, the entire atmosphere of North Korea changed. Despite the planes dropping thousands of tons of bombs, North Korea finally breathed a sigh of relief and breathed healthily and happily again.
    Let's look at an ordinary small city - Yichuan. It was indeed wounded, with bomb craters all over the ground and houses collapsing in pieces. But Yichuan is still so beautiful: along the small mountain covered with pine and cypress trees, facing a vast rice field. In the offices of those hardworking staff members, lights are still on, reflecting the firelight caused by enemy bombing in front of the door, showing that Yichuan will never be a dead city, and will never succumb to the enemy.
    Along the way, there were pine and cypress arches welcoming the Chinese People's Volunteer Army everywhere. Slogans in both Chinese and Korean were posted everywhere. Crowds welcoming the Volunteer Army often appeared in places we didn't expect: at the narrow mouth of a winding ditch, or in a very small thatched house. Women and children raised their hands and shouted to us: "Mao Zedong Mansei (Long Live)!" "Zhiwengun Mansei (Volunteer Army Long Live)!" Under the moonlight, the national flags of China and North Korea fluttered together above their heads.
    The Korean people never drink boiled water. But on both sides of the main street near Pingkang City North Station, hot boiled water awaits the Volunteer Army every night. The girls in charge of the reception have also specially learned two Chinese sentences: "Comrades, you've worked hard, please drink boiled water!" We then say thank you in Korean. The friendship is deep, but the language is not understood, which is really painful. Therefore, both sides are working hard to learn languages. When we learned the Korean word for "thank you," we couldn't remember it for a long time. Finally, the translator said: "Just remember: There is a tall horse. How tall is it? Four meters! Then you can easily remember the sentence 'Gao Ma Si Mi Da' (thank you)."
    Often on the road marching at night, we see countless elderly people. Adults and women, wearing thin clothes, drive oxen to deliver military food, or build bridges and repair roads.
    Songs never stopped along the way. Many schools have classes again at night. The children sang loudly, sending off our south-bound troops and welcoming our north-bound troops. The troops flowed endlessly, and the songs flowed endlessly. Sometimes we also sing, and the children are happy to jump, shout, clap their hands. In Jinhua, Volunteer Army comrades and local cadres held a party. Comrades from the Volunteer Army's art troupe sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" in Korean, and the four female comrades from the Jinhua propaganda team sang "The East is Red" in Chinese. Finally, the whole audience sang together in two different languages. ...
            (V)
    We advanced southward in the cheers and love of the Korean people. Their hatred is forever in our hearts, and their encouragement is constantly growing strength within us. In this way, we cheerfully endure unprecedented hardships, and we overcome unprecedented difficulties one by one. The soldiers said that we have undergone four major tests in fighting in Korea: airplanes, cannons, snow mountains, and ice rivers. The deep friendship of the Korean brothers gave us this strength. I remember when we were in the Gucheng area, one of our company commanders talked to a comrade of the People's Army. When he said that "the blood of Korean brothers is also sprinkled on the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China," he was immediately hugged tightly. The hot tears of the People's Army comrade dripped on the uniform of the Volunteer Army comrade, which was inlaid with red edges. Soon, in the battle to resist the American imperialist aggressors, they shed blood together again on the hills of North Korea. The deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is built up in this way. Our soldiers' current slogans are:
    "We will never return home until we eliminate the invading army in Korea!" "We will never return home until we liberate all of Korea!" "We will not have the face to return home unless we make meritorious contributions in Korea!"

　　南进道上
    本报特约记者  徐逸人
            （一）
    在一九五○年末，中国人民志愿军千百支进军的矛头，越过了北朝鲜一道一道的冰河雪山，直指三八线。那时候，在战地收音机的喇叭里，同样能听到帝国主义者在假惺惺地叫所谓“停火”；但我们却亲眼看到，正是帝国主义者在朝鲜这块土地上放火。黑夜之中，北朝鲜美丽的大森林被飞机打着了，就像是无数条火龙在山间滚动。在朝鲜北部，我们能看到的每一个村庄都在着火，把那些还不会说话、还不知道什么叫恐怖的孩子都吓得直哭。曾经有一次，我在山头工事中不到二十公尺的视界内，看到一间正被飞机打着火的屋里奔出来三个人，一个老汉，还有一个妇女拉着一个小孩。后两个人刚从烈焰中跌出就栽倒了。老人摸了摸她们，看看再不能生还，就弄张破席把她们盖上跑开了。临走之前，他在火上烤了烤自己的脚。全部家财现在能给他的只是这一点“温暖”。又一个夜晚，在钢盔罩着油灯的小屋里，一个二十五岁的人民军战士崔光洪同志与我闲谈。他说，他们小队一共十三个人，全都希望打完了美国鬼子去中国看看。“我们都是毫无牵挂的人。我们的家庭都被美国的飞机大炮毁灭了，亲人全都死掉！”说着他低垂了头，热泪盈眶。……对于这样的战士，对于目睹美帝国主义斑斑罪行的我们志愿军和朝鲜人民军每个同志，是永远也不相信美帝国主义会对他们真正“停火”的。他们奋勇南进，决心向敌人报仇，保卫和重建自己幸福的家园。
            （二）
    我们在初冬的一夜渡过清川江。价川附近，公路两旁，就是三天前歼灭美军和它的帮凶土耳其旅的战场。几百辆好的或坏的汽车，各种类型的大炮和坦克，横七竖八地分布在四方。这些美国工厂的出品，今天已由他们自己的人带着送到了朝鲜，作为给我们志愿军的见面礼。
    汽车向德川开进。公路在拔海一千三百公尺的高山上盘旋，白天看时就像是一条白玉带把山缠着。大雪在夜空飞舞，西北风在嚎叫。汽车熄灯慢行，到跟前才看见一个个画着惊叹号（表示危险）或是“Ｚ”形符号（表示公路急遽转弯）的木牌。在最高峰的豁口处，一辆被打坏的十轮美国军用卡车挡住了路。我们掀它不动，只能削山开路。我跳下汽车，好像踩着一根木头。打电棒一看，原来是一只美军尸体的腿。另一条腿和它成八字形分叉在一个车轮的两边。这一位年青的美国兵，围着围巾，刚刮净他的胡髭，黄色的蜷发披散在雪地上。他张着血流成浆的嘴，让雪花飘进他的喉咙。从他衣袋中的精装笔记本里，我们找到一张女人的照片，不知是他的什么人，只在背后用英文写着：“迪尔，你什么时候回来呢？她每天每夜在盼望着！”……她的“迪尔”是永远回不去了。现在只能由我们代告这位美国夫人或小姐：你的“迪尔”已经在茫茫大雪的冬夜，战死在北朝鲜荒凉的高山，为着美国独占大资本家的利益当了炮灰。
            （三）
    战场一带老乡都是逃难刚回来。他们餐风宿露，流离失所，各有自己的血泪故事。我们不必四处去采访调查，就看面前这两家房东吧。一家：一个老太太带着三个女孩，她的儿子参加了人民军，老太太还让我们看了这青年战士的照片。她的房屋，粮食，衣柜，全部被美国的一颗汽油弹烧成灰烬。现在一家四口借住在邻居屋中。另一家，这屋子的主人，是一对六、七十岁的老夫妇；还有个媳妇带着三个小孩，最大的还不到五岁。儿子叫美国人抓走了，媳妇是昨天刚从娘家回来的。她原听说丈夫已经逃回，但回来一看没有，马上又哭开了。她不过二十几岁，如果丈夫真的不再回来，这一家老老小小，她实在难以支持呀！
    一个夜晚，我们到公路边的一家屋里等汽车。这一家妇女娃娃挤满了一地炕。可是当翻译同志说明了我们的意思，她们还是热情地给腾出一块地方。闲谈变成了诉苦。一位老太太说，中国志愿军这样和气，这样好，她从来没有见过。她说三天以前，美国人和土耳其人才从这里退走，那些人全是野兽。他们把十三、四岁以上的女人全都抓来，一个一个地摸弄她们的乳房，看看出不出水。只有老得不再出水的才被放掉，其他所有来不及逃脱的妇女全被野兽们糟踏了。她声明：这些话本来都是说不出口的，但是仇恨烧裂了她的心，又见到我们这些亲人，就一点也不在乎地说出来了。又一个年轻的妇女说，她是个刚出嫁的姑娘，现在是劳动党员，村民青（青年组织）的委员长。她丈夫今晚给志愿军带路去了。当敌人占在这里的时候，美国人把她丈夫抓走，限他在三天之内交出新婚的妻。但他没有屈服，准备牺牲自己；而在第三天清晨，志愿军打来了。敌人狼狈逃命，她丈夫才跑回家。
            （四）
    去年十月，是北朝鲜最艰难的日子。敌人眼看要打到鸭绿江。那时候，我们刚离祖国，到了朝鲜前线。我们常在离敌人很近的道上，遇到一群一群逃难的人民。他们匆匆离开燃烧的家园，避向深山。老年人一路叹息；白衣白裙的妇女背着小孩，头上顶着大包袱跟在后边。他们一声不响，把这血海深仇默默地记在心上。人民军同志从前方下来，和我们紧紧握手，看得出心里是兴奋而难过。多少个家庭离散了，多少个人日夜生活在血泪中。……可是，当敌人从清川江被赶到三八线，整个北朝鲜的气氛就变了。尽管飞机投下千百吨炸弹，北朝鲜终于缓过气来，重新健康愉快地呼吸了。
    就让我们看一座普通的小城——伊川。它确是负过伤，满地是炸弹坑，房屋一片片倒塌。但伊川还是那样美：沿着长满松柏的小山，面临一片广阔的稻田。在那些辛勤的工作人员的办公地方，依然亮着灯火，与门前敌机轰炸烧起的火光相照，显示了伊川永远不会是一座死城，永远不会向敌人屈服。
    一路上到处都是欢迎中国人民志愿军的松柏牌楼。到处贴着中朝两国文字的标语。欢迎志愿军的人群常在我们意料不到的地方出现：拐湾狭窄的沟口，或是一间很小的草房。妇女和孩子向我们举手高呼：“毛泽东满赛（万岁）！”“志文滚满赛（志愿军万岁）！”在月光下，中朝两国的国旗在她们头上一起飘扬。
    朝鲜人民是从来不喝开水的。可是在平康城北车站附近的大街两旁，夜夜都有滚热的开水等着志愿军。负责招待的女孩子们，还特地学会两句中国话：“辛苦啦同志，请喝开水！”我们则用朝鲜话说着谢谢。情谊深厚却又语言不通，实在是个痛苦。因此双方都在努力学话。我们学“谢谢”这句朝鲜话时，好久都记不住。最后翻译同志说：“你就记：有一匹高大的马。究竟多高呢？四米达！这你就容易记住‘高马四米达’（谢谢）这句话了。”
    时常在黑夜行军的路上，我们看见无数的老人。壮年和妇女，穿着单薄的衣裳，赶着黄牛送军粮，或者搭桥修路。
    一路歌声不断。许多学校夜晚又上课了。孩子们用嘹亮的嗓子高唱着，欢送我们南去的队伍，欢迎我们北来的队伍。队伍川流不息，歌声川流不息。有时我们也唱，孩子们就乐得又跳又叫又拍手。在金化，志愿军同志与地方干部开了个联欢会。志愿军文工团的同志们，用朝鲜语唱了“金日成将军之歌”，金化宣传队的四个女同志，则用中国语唱了“东方红”。最后，全场用两种不同的语言合唱着。……
            （五）
    我们在朝鲜人民的欢呼热爱中向南挺进。他们的仇恨永远记在我们心中，他们的鼓励时时在我们身上生长着力量。就这样，空前的艰苦我们愉快地忍受着，空前的困难被我们一个个克服。战士们说，我们入朝鲜作战经受了四大考验：飞机，大炮，雪山，冰河。朝鲜兄弟的深厚情谊给了我们这个力量。记得在龟城地区时，我们一位连长和人民军同志谈话。当他说到“在中华人民共和国的五星红旗上，也洒有朝鲜兄弟的血”，立刻他就被紧紧拥抱起来。人民军同志的热泪滴落在镶着红边的志愿军同志的服装上。不久，在阻击美帝国主义侵略军的战斗中，他们又在北朝鲜的山坡一起流血。中朝人民的深厚感情，就是这样建立起来的。我们战士现在的口号是：
    “不消灭在朝鲜的侵略军决不回国！”“不解放全朝鲜决不回国！”“不在朝鲜立功，没有脸面回国！”
