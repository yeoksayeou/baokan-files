　　Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries is Inseparable from Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Yang Zhensheng
    I most admire those hearty words that Lu Xun shouted out in "Diary of a Madman": "...I opened history and checked; this history has no dates. The words 'benevolence, righteousness, and morality' are written crookedly across every page. I couldn't sleep anyway, and after carefully reading half the night, I saw words between the lines, and the whole book was filled with the words 'eat people'!" He not only pierced through the history of China in the past with one stroke, but also pierced through the history of all mankind. Probably from slave society to the era of imperialism, this trick of "eating people" has been played all along. The only difference is that the methods are becoming more and more clever and circuitous, and the eating is becoming more thorough and universal.
    Since Marx scientifically proved the exploitation of capitalism, and Lenin scientifically proved the ferocity of imperialism, this great historical deception of the past has begun to be thoroughly exposed. Thus, there are people in this world who no longer "eat people," and there are also people who continue to "eat people." Those who no longer "eat people" have formed a battle line, which is the peace line headed by the Soviet Union. Those who continue to "eat people" have also formed a battle line, which is the aggression line headed by the United States. These two battle lines are not divided by countries or nationalities, but by revolution and counter-revolution. We must suppress counter-revolutionaries internally precisely because we must resist imperialism externally; to resist imperialism externally, we cannot but suppress counter-revolutionaries internally. It is precisely because the enemy's battle line is one, so our treatment methods are inseparable.
    We do not allow the "eating of people" to continue to exist, so the American imperialists are the first to panic. On the one hand, they launched the invasion of Korea, and on the other hand, they formed a battle line with the reactionary remnants entrenched in Taiwan, sending special agents and spies to sneak into our mainland to carry out sabotage. Where do these special agents and spies go to find helpers? Naturally, they first join forces with those landlords, habitual bandits, local bullies, and reactionary secret society leaders who used to eat people and still want to continue "eating people." Look, this counter-revolutionary united front stretches all the way from Wall Street in the United States to every corner of our mainland! Furthermore, since the American imperialists invaded Korea, domestic reactionaries have emerged from underground to carry out rampant activities; and after the American imperialists were defeated, they tucked their tails and scurried back underground. The advance and retreat of the American imperialists in Korea has simply become the baton for their activities. Isn't it clear that counter-revolutionaries and American imperialists are in cahoots with each other?
    In order to resist America and aid Korea, we must step up production, cherish resources, and protect transportation. Counter-revolutionaries come to sabotage our generators and steel plants, and burn warehouses and bridges. Last year, they burned more than fifty trams in Beijing. Can we not suppress this?
    In order to resist America and aid Korea, our government and people, our various parties, nationalities, and strata, must unite into a battle line, with one heart and one mind, and one strength. We have done this, and counter-revolutionaries come to fabricate lies, sow discord, and try to tear apart our unity and disperse our strength. Can we not suppress this?
    In order to resist America and aid Korea, we must stabilize domestic order. Counter-revolutionaries spread rumors, disturb people's hearts, openly rob, and assassinate cadres. They also create disturbances and riots in some places, and even want to carry out their so-called "mainland guerrilla warfare." Can we not suppress this?
    At the recently concluded first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the speakers of the nineteen discussion groups almost unanimously denounced the open or latent activities and atrocities of counter-revolutionaries in various fields, and criticized the government for not doing enough or thoroughly enough in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, a resolution was passed: "Calling on the people of the city to unanimously support and assist the government, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants, eliminate bandit leaders, habitual bandits, local bullies, special agents, and reactionary secret society leaders, further consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital, ensure the smooth progress of various construction projects in the capital, and protect the safety of the people's lives and property." This voice of the people has not only been shouted out in the capital, but also shouted just as loudly at people's congresses in other places. Therefore, we know that the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-revolutionaries" recently promulgated by the Central People's Government not only specifically implements the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but also directly reflects the unanimous demands of the people of the whole country.
    Lu Xun once said to those who "eat people" with earnest sincerity: "You can change, change from the bottom of your heart! You must know that in the future there will be no room for people who eat people to live in the world."
    These words, like prophecies, can be used to warn those counter-revolutionaries.

### 镇压反革命和抗美援朝分不开

　　镇压反革命和抗美援朝分不开
    杨振声
    我最佩服鲁迅在《狂人日记》里喊出来的那几句痛快话：“……我翻开历史一查，这历史没有年代，歪歪斜斜的每叶上都写着‘仁义道德’几个字。我横竖睡不着，仔细看了半夜，才从字缝里看出字来，满本都写着两个字是‘吃人’！”他不但一笔戳穿了中国过去的历史，也戳穿了整个人类的历史。大概自奴隶社会以至帝国主义时代，一直就在耍这“吃人”的把戏，不同的只是手法愈来愈巧妙，愈曲折，而吃的也愈彻底愈普遍罢了。
    自从马克思以科学方法证实了资本主义的剥削，列宁又以科学方法证实了帝国主义的凶暴后，这过去历史的大骗局就开始彻底地被揭穿了。于是这世界就有了不再“吃人”的人，也还有继续“吃人”的人。不再“吃人”的人联成一条战线，这就是以苏联为首的和平战线。继续“吃人”的人也联成一条战线，这就是以美国为首的侵略战线。这两条战线不是以国家民族来划分，而是以革命与反革命来划分的。我们对内要镇压反革命，正是因为对外要反抗帝国主义；对外要反抗帝国主义，对内就不能不镇压反革命。正是因为敌人的战线是一条，所以我们的对待办法也就分不开。
    我们是不允许“吃人”的事继续存在的，于是美帝国主义者就首先着了慌。一面发动侵略朝鲜，一面又同盘踞在台湾的反动残余联成一条战线，派遣特务、密探，潜入我国内地进行破坏。这些特务、密探，那里去找帮手呢？自然就先同那些以前吃过人，现在还想继续“吃人”的地主、惯匪、恶霸与反动道会门头子，连合成一条战线。看，这一条反革命联合战线，就一直从美国的华尔街拉到我们内地的各角落！再看，自美帝国主义侵朝以来，国内的反动分子如何地都从地下钻出头来，大肆活动；而美帝国主义被击溃以后，他们又如何地夹着尾巴，钻到地下去；美帝国主义在朝鲜的进退，简直成了他们活动的指挥刀，反革命分子与美帝国主义沆瀣一气，这还不清清楚楚的吗？
    为了抗美援朝，我们就必须要加紧生产，爱惜资源，保护交通。反革命分子就来破坏我们的发电机、钢铁厂，焚烧仓库、桥梁。去年在北京烧毁我们五十几辆电车，这个我们能不镇压吗？
    为了抗美援朝，我们的政府和人民，我们的各党派，各民族，各阶层，就必须结合成一条战线，一条心，一个力量。我们是这样作了，反革命分子就来制造谎言，挑拨离间，想拆开我们的团结，分散我们的力量，这个我们能不镇压吗？
    为了抗美援朝，我们就必须安定国内的秩序。反革命分子就散布谣言，扰乱人心，公开抢劫，刺杀干部。又在一些地方骚扰变乱，甚至想进行其所谓“大陆游击”。这个我们能不镇压吗？
    在刚开过的北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议的席上，十九个讨论小组的代表发言人，几乎一致的控诉了反革命分子在各方面公开的或潜伏的活动与暴行，又批评了政府对镇压反革命作的不够，不彻底。于是通过了决议：“号召全市人民一致支持与协助政府，坚决镇压反革命活动，肃清反革命残余，肃清匪首，惯匪，恶霸，特务及反动会道门头子，进一步巩固首都的革命秩序，保障首都各项建设的顺利进行，并保障人民生命财产的安全。”这个人民的声音，不独在首都喊了出来，在其他各处的人民代表会议上，也喊的同样的响亮。因此，我们知道中央人民政府最近所公布的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》，不独具体实施了中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条的规定，而且是直接反映了全国人民的一致要求。
    鲁迅曾对那“吃人”的人，慈口婆心地说：“你们可以改了，从真心改起！要晓得将来容不得吃人的人活在世上。”
    这些话像预言一样，可以拿来告诫那些反革命分子。
