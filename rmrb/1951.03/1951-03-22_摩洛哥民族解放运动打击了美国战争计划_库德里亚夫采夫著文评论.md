Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: Kudryavtsev, in an article in Izvestia, pointed out the great significance of the Moroccan national liberation movement's frustration of the American warmongers' war plans in the Mediterranean. The author wrote: In the military and strategic plans of American imperialism, North Africa and all the Near East countries occupy the most important position. Morocco is also placed in a considerable position. With the active help of the French government, the American military has recently been building a series of airports, constructing port facilities, and huge ammunition depots in Morocco. But the Moroccan people are unwilling to turn their country into a springboard for American imperialist aggressive adventures. Their national liberation movement hinders American plans. The terrorist means used by the French colonial authorities in Morocco, backed by American imperialism, have aroused widespread anger and protest throughout the Arab East. This situation makes the American imperialists extremely alarmed.
The author pointed out: This event happened to coincide with the meeting of American diplomatic representatives in the Middle East in Istanbul, which discussed turning the Arab East into a military bridgehead for American and British imperialism and organizing a unified Arab army to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's forces. This illustrates that the concerns of the real instigators of the bloody events in Morocco—the American warmongers—are not accidental.

　　摩洛哥民族解放运动打击了美国战争计划
    库德里亚夫采夫著文评论
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：库德里亚夫采夫在消息报著文，指出了摩洛哥民族解放运动已使美国战争贩子在地中海的战争计划受到挫折的重大意义。作者写道：在美帝国主义的军事与战略计划中，北非与所有近东国家占有最重要的地位。摩洛哥也被放在一个相当的地位上。美国军方最近在法国政府的积极帮助下，正在摩洛哥建筑一系列的飞机场、修建海港设备和巨大的军火仓库。但是摩洛哥人民不愿意把他们的国家变成美帝国主义侵略冒险的跳板。他们的民族解放运动阻碍了美国的计划。而以美帝国主义为靠山的法国殖民当局对摩洛哥人民所使用的恐怖手段，却在整个阿拉伯东方激起广泛的愤怒与抗议。这种形势就使得美帝国主义者极为惊慌。
    作者指出：这个事件恰巧发生在美国驻中近东各国外交代表在伊斯坦布尔举行会议的时候，这个会议讨论了把阿拉伯东方变成美英帝国主义军事桥头堡和组织阿拉伯统一军以参加北大西洋集团军队的问题。这就说明了摩洛哥血腥事件的真正策动者——美国战争贩子——的忧虑不是偶然的。
