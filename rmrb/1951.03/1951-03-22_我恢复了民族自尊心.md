　　I Have Regained My National Self-Esteem
　　Student of the History Department, Yenching University, Shen Yusheng
　　I grew up in a feudal family. My older brothers and sisters and I all studied in missionary schools. Three of my brothers and one brother-in-law are all students of Yenching University, and one is still in the United States, unwilling to return while taking $120 a month from the State Department for selling himself. Therefore, from a very young age, the roots of worshiping and being close to America were planted in my mind. During the period of Japanese occupation, I thought the United States was a symbol of "democracy and freedom." At that time, I was studying at Yu Ying Middle School, and I felt honored that the school hung the American flag.

　　Once, in a movie theater, the roof collapsed, and the audience fled in droves. Just as I was about to run, I was suddenly held down in my seat by an American. At that time, I was extremely ashamed, feeling that the Chinese were too disorderly. However, this American fellow who held me down rushed out past me. I was stunned, unable to find an answer.

　　After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the United States became even better in my eyes. In Shanghai, I indulged in the "American way of life" all day long: watching American movies, wearing American clothes, and using American things.

　　Before liberation, because I witnessed the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique with my own eyes, and was influenced by some progressive classmates, I had a little sympathy for the Communist Party. However, I still hoped that the United States could aid the scum like Hu Shi and Li Zongren. When Beijing was besieged, I thought of flying back to Shanghai, believing that Shanghai had Americans, and the Communist Party would definitely not dare to attack, nor would they be able to. Later, after being persuaded by my classmates, I finally stayed. After Beijing's liberation, I still felt that the Communists lacked knowledge, lacked work efficiency, and would definitely not be able to do a good job in economic work. Therefore, I decided to come to Yenching, this cultural concession, to take refuge, so as not to have to earn a few kilograms of millet and engage in ideological remolding. I looked forward to the Third World War, hoping to use it to restore my past decadent life. I remained indifferent to the victory of the Chinese people.

　　In the spring of 1949, not long after liberation, I was living in Tianjin. At that time, the Chinese people took control of their customs for the first time. When an American ship arrived in Tanggu, the military control personnel of the Tianjin Customs boarded the ship to inspect it. They wore old military uniforms, refused the Americans' "attentive" hospitality, and sat on the deck, eating the corn buns and pickled vegetables they had brought with them. When I heard this news, I felt very ashamed again, thinking they were ignorant and impolite "bumpkins."

　　At the time, I didn't realize that this was a manifestation of the Chinese people truly standing up and becoming masters of the country. I didn't even think about what these ships had brought to the Chinese people over the past century? What had they taken away? It was the goods brought by these American ships that hindered the development of our country's industry and commerce; it was these ships that brought opium, bringing poverty and disaster.

　　I, a Youth League member of nearly a year, was still being poisoned by pro-American ideas.

　　When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, I believed that American imperialism would not invade our country, and firmly opposed our volunteer army assisting Korea. After the volunteer army went to Korea, I was worried all day long, thinking that the beautiful ancient city of Beijing would definitely be destroyed in the bombing. It wasn't until the volunteer army achieved a great victory in Korea that I woke up from my dream and realized my fear of America.

　　For more than a decade, the cultural aggression of American imperialism has seriously poisoned me, making me look down on myself, willing to be a slave; turning a once innocent child into an American-style rogue. Such hatred is intolerable to a youth of New China. In the past few years, under the education of the Party, I have gradually awakened from the crimes caused by imperialist economic and cultural aggression; I have been reborn from the despair and decadent chronic suicide. From today onwards, I will no longer be inferior, I want to happily be a glorious Chinese.

### 我恢复了民族自尊心

　　我恢复了民族自尊心
    燕京大学历史系学生  沈裕生
    我从小生长在一个封建的家庭里，哥哥姐姐和我都是在教会学校里念书。三个哥哥、一个姐夫都是燕京的学生，至今还有一个在美国每月拿着国务院的一百二十元卖身钱不肯回来。因此，在我很小的时候，脑子里就已经有了崇美、亲美思想的根源。日寇占领时期，我以为美国是“民主与自由”国家的象征。那时，我在育英中学读书，学校挂着美国国旗，我觉得很光荣。
    有一次，在电影院里，因为屋顶塌落，观众纷纷外逃。我正想跑的时候，突然被一个美国人按在座位上。当时，我羞愧极了，觉得中国人太无秩序。但是，这个按住我的美国家伙却越过我向外冲出去。我愣在那里，想不出一个答案来。
    日本帝国主义投降以后，美国在我眼里变得更好了。在上海，我整天沉溺在“美国生活方式”中：看美国电影，穿美国衣服，用美国东西。
    解放前，由于我亲眼看到了蒋介石反动集团的贪污腐化，同时受到一些进步同学的影响，对共产党有了一点同情心。但是，我仍然盼望着美国能援助胡适、李宗仁之流的败类。北京被围时，我曾想飞回上海，以为上海有美国人，共产党一定不敢打，也打不进去。后来经过同学们的劝告，我终于留下来了。北京解放以后，我仍觉得共产党人没有知识，缺乏工作效率，经济工作一定搞不好，因此我又决定到燕京这块文化租界来避难，免得出去挣那几斤小米，还要搞什么思想改造。我期待着第三次大战，想借此恢复我过去的腐烂生活。对于中国人民的胜利我却无动于中。
    一九四九年春天，解放后不久，我在天津住着。那时，中国人民第一次掌握了自己的海关。一只美国船到了塘沽，津海关的军事管制人员，就上船去检查。他们穿着旧军服，拒绝了美国人的“殷勤”招待，坐在甲板上，吃自己带去的窝窝头和咸菜。我听到了这个消息，又感觉到非常耻辱，认为他们是无知识无礼貌的“土包子”。
    我当时没有想到这是中国人民真正站起来，当了国家主人的表现。我甚至没有想到，百年来这些船只给中国人民带来了些什么？带走了些什么？就是这些美国船只带来的商品，阻碍了我国工商业的发展；就是这些船只带来了鸦片，带来了贫困和灾难。
    我，一个入团快一年的青年团员，仍然受着亲美思想的毒害。
    抗美援朝运动开始时，我认为美帝国主义不至于侵略我国，坚决反对我国志愿军援朝。志愿军到朝鲜后，我整天提心吊胆着，以为北京这座美丽的古城一定要毁于轰炸中。直到志愿军在朝鲜大捷，我才如梦方醒，认识了自己的恐美病。
    十几年来，美帝国主义的文化侵略，严重地毒害了我，使我看不起自己，甘心做奴才；使一个原是天真的孩子，逐渐变成一个美国式的流氓。这样的仇恨是一个新中国的青年所不能容忍的。几年来在党的教育下，我逐渐由帝国主义经济、文化侵略所造成的罪恶中苏醒；由绝望、颓唐的慢性自杀中新生。从今天起，我不再自卑了，我要愉快做一个光荣的中国人。
