　　Beijing Suburbs' Twelfth District Holds People's Representative Conference
    Elects District Head, Deputy District Heads, and District Government Committee Members
    Adopts a Simple and Easy Hand-Raising Voting Method, Fully Demonstrating Democracy
    [Our Newspaper] According to the resolution of the first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the second People's Representative Conference of the Twelfth District of Beijing Suburbs elected Lu Lianying as District Head, Li Peishan and Bi Qiming as Deputy District Heads, and Wang Jinzhen (female labor model), Ma Qing (railway worker representative, special-class labor hero) and ten others as District Government Committee members on the 15th of this month by raising their hands to vote. The election of a district government by the people is a major event in Beijing's history.

    Since the end of February, the district's People's Consultative Committee, village People's Representative Conferences (i.e., peasant representative conferences during the land reform period), and various people's organizations have repeatedly deliberated, consulted, and discussed, and elected 134 representatives through direct, indirect election, and invitation methods. Of these, 89.5 percent were directly or indirectly elected, 8.2 percent were consulted and invited, and 2.2 percent were representatives of the district government. In terms of election methods, in addition to the fact that people's organizations mostly adopted the method of recommendation, 21 of the 57 farmer electoral districts adopted direct elections; and another 36 adopted indirect elections. After the district representative conference opened on the 13th, the nomination of candidates by each group took a whole day, and the debate was very heated, demonstrating a high degree of responsibility to the people. When the formal election was conducted on the 15th, each representative gave a free introduction of the candidates, and finally voted by raising hands. The masses were satisfied with the election results. This shows that the method of raising hands to vote is not only familiar and convenient for the general peasant masses, but also avoids formalism and can better give play to democracy.

    The district has a total population of 120,000, of which farmers account for about 70 percent. This time, farmer representatives accounted for more than 68.6 percent of the total number of representatives. They account for nearly one-third of the district government committee members. This reflects the characteristics of the district's rural environment. However, the farmers are very good at taking care of other strata, and specially invited representatives of ethnic minorities, religious circles, and rich peasants to participate. Railway worker representative Ma Qing and industrial and commercial representative Zhao Jiwu were elected as district government committee members. This makes the district government more closely connected with the people of all democratic strata.

    At this representative conference, the most pressing issues of concern to the masses were also discussed and resolved. A total of 142 proposals were submitted, including 52 on agricultural production, 30 on culture and education, 25 on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and only 5 on cadre work style (a significant reduction compared to more than 120 in the previous session). This shows that after the completion of land reform and the solution of the cadre work style problem, increasing agricultural production, consolidating the democratic government, and developing culture and education have become the most urgent demands of the people today.

    After the representative conference successfully completed the election, Chai Zemin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, congratulated the success of the election on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Government. He said: Do not forget the conditions for the success of this popular election. The main reasons were that under the leadership of the Communist Party, land reform was completed, the people had considerable organization, a large number of peasants learned culture, the people became familiar with political representatives who could represent their interests in the struggle, the people loved and actively supported the state power, and the experience of the Beijing municipal election was absorbed. He hopes that the representatives will better serve the people and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　京郊第十二区举行人民代表会议
    选举区长副区长和区政府委员
    采用举手表决方式简而易行充分发挥民主
    【本报讯】北京市郊第十二区第二届人民代表会议根据北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议的决议，已于本月十五日用举手表决方式选出区长吕连英、副区长李培山、毕启明及区政府委员王金珍（女劳动模范）、马清（铁路工人代表、特等劳动英雄）等十一人。民选区政府在北京历史上是一件大事。
    该区自二月下旬起，曾先后经区各界人民协商委员会、村人民代表会议（即土地改革时期的农民代表大会），以及各人民团体多次的酝酿、协商、讨论，并用直接间接选举与邀请等方式选出代表一百三十四人。其中有百分之八十九点五是直接或间接选举的，百分之八点二是协商邀请的，百分之二点二是区政府代表。在选举的方式上，除人民团体多采用推选办法外，在五十七个农民选区中，就有二十一个是采用直接选举的；另有三十六个是间接选举的。十三日，区代表会议开幕后，各小组提候选人名单，就用了一整天时间，争论很热烈，表现了高度的对人民负责的精神。及至十五日正式进行选举时，由各代表对候选人作自由介绍后，最后用举手方式进行表决。选举结果群众认为满意。这就说明采用举手表决的方式，既为一般农民群众所熟悉和便利进行，又避免了形式主义，更能发挥民主性。
    该区共十二万人口，农民占百分之七十左右。这次农民代表占全体代表数的百分之六十八点六强。在区政府委员中则占近三分之一。这反映了该区农村环境的特点。但农民们很善于照顾其他各阶层，并特别邀请了少数民族、宗教界和富农代表参加。铁路工人代表马清和工商界代表赵辑五则被选为区政府委员。这就使区政权更加密切地联系了各民主阶层的人民。
    在这次代表会议上，还讨论与解决了群众中当前最迫切的问题，大会提案总计一百四十二件，其中关于农业生产的提案即达五十二件，文化教育的三十件，镇压反革命的二十五件，而关于干部作风的提案只有五件（这和上届一百二十多件相比已大为减少）。这就说明完成土地改革，解决干部作风问题后，农业增产、巩固民主政权和发展文化教育，已成为人民群众今天最迫切的要求了。
    代表会议胜利地完成选举后，北京市人民政府副秘书长柴泽民同志曾代表北京市政府祝贺选举的成功，他说：不要忘记了这次民选成功的条件，主要是在共产党的领导下，完成了土地改革，人民有了相当的组织，大批农民学习了文化，人民在斗争中熟悉了能代表他们利益的政治代表人物，人民热爱和积极拥护国家政权，以及吸收了北京市选举的经验。他希望各代表更好地为人民服务，巩固人民民主专政。
