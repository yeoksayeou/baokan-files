China Department Store Northeast Regional Company
    Self-Criticism on Blindly Transporting and Selling White Sugar
    China Department Store Accepts Lessons and Improves Business Management

To the Editors:

    Regarding the criticism in the People's Daily on February 2nd entitled "Northeast Department Store Blindly Transports and Sells White Sugar, Causing National Losses," we hereby submit the following self-criticism:

    First, the publication of this article has provided us with powerful enlightenment in terms of ideology and will greatly promote improvements in our future work. We will certainly humbly examine and summarize some of the problems in our past business operations.

    Second, this batch of sugar was imported temporarily from abroad to avoid foreign exchange losses. To avoid congestion at the port, the responsible comrade of the Northeast Trade Department's office in Guangzhou, under the principle of "Northeast materials being transported back to the Northeast" decided to transport the sugar back to Shenyang during an emergency rush. After the Northeast Regional Department Store received a telegram from Guangzhou on the 12th stating "Sugar already sent to Shenyang," it immediately considered that it was inappropriate to transport this sugar back to the Northeast because the Northeast still needed to sell sugar within the customs. If sugar were transported from Guangzhou to Shenyang and then back within the customs (Baoding), the transportation costs alone would amount to 14,016,691,800 Northeast currency, which would be a serious waste of national manpower and financial resources. Therefore, we immediately telegraphed the China Department Store, requesting that they allocate this sugar to them and leave it for sale within the customs (Note: The Northeast Department Store and the China Department Store signed a contract in 1950 for Northeast sugar entering the customs, which had not yet been fully delivered, and the contract stipulated that the delivery location for the outstanding amount was Baoding). However, because the Northeast Telegraph Bureau mistakenly sent the telegram's original 900 tons as 9,000 tons (the Northeast Telegraph Bureau's sloppy work style should be reviewed—Editor), the discrepancy was too large, which increased the China Department Store's difficulty in handling this issue. When we urgently needed to transport the sugar out of Guangzhou, we decided to transport the sugar destined for Shenyang to Baoding.

    Third, the reason for transporting this imported sugar north to Baoding was our insufficient understanding of the national sugar transportation and sales situation. We only considered the Northeast region and thought that not transporting sugar back to the Northeast would save national transportation capacity. At the same time, we transferred this batch of sugar to Baoding without a formal written report and without obtaining the approval of the superior company. Therefore, we fully accept your newspaper's criticism of our blind transportation and sales this time.

    The publication of the "Blindly Transporting and Selling White Sugar" criticism in the People's Daily is a very good education for all our trade workers, especially in strengthening organizational concepts and strictly implementing the reporting system. We hope that the Party newspaper will continue to provide guidance and criticism to our work in the future.

                                        China Department Store Northeast Regional Company

To the Editors:

    The article "Northeast Department Store Blindly Transports and Sells White Sugar, Causing National Losses" published in your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column on February 2nd has given us great ideological enlightenment and assistance. In addition to the self-criticism made by the Northeast Department Store, we also humbly accept this criticism and make the following self-criticism:

    First, when the Northeast Regional Department Store transported sugar from Guangzhou, our company also imported a large amount of sugar from Qingdao and Tianjin. The North China region already felt that warehouse storage conditions were insufficient and needed to transfer some to the Central South region. We did not inform the Northeast Department Store of this change in the domestic sugar business and transportation situation in advance, which resulted in the sugar being transported to Baoding, causing a waste of manpower and financial resources. This is part of the responsibility we should bear.

    Second, the Northeast Department Store telegraphed us for instructions, intending to hand over this batch of imported sugar for us to receive. Because the telegram mistakenly stated 900 tons as 9,000 tons, we were unable to make a timely decision, causing the Northeast Department Store to transport this batch of sugar to Baoding, where the Hebei Provincial Department Store was unable to receive it. This is also something we should review.

    This criticism has further educated us to realize that our business management is not perfect. We will now accept these experiences and lessons, strengthen cadre education, improve business management, ensure that we do a good job in our state-owned trade work, and prevent similar events from happening again.

                                                China Department Store

### 中国百货公司东北区公司  对盲目运销白糖的检讨   中国百货公司接受教训改进经营管理工作

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　中国百货公司东北区公司
    对盲目运销白糖的检讨
    中国百货公司接受教训改进经营管理工作编辑同志：
    二月二日人民日报载《东北百货公司盲目运销白糖，造成国家损失》的批评，我们特作如下检讨：
    第一、这篇稿件登出以后，在思想上给了我们有力的启示，对改进今后工作有很大的推动作用。我们一定虚心地检查与总结过去经营业务上的一些问题。
    第二，该项砂糖系避免外汇损失，临时从国外进口的物资。为避免口岸堵塞，在紧急的抢运情况下，东北贸易部驻广州办事处负责同志按“东北物资运回东北”的原则，决定将糖运回沈阳。东北区百货公司在十二日接到广州拍来“糖已发沈”的电报后，当即考虑到此项砂糖运回东北是不恰当的，因为东北砂糖尚需进关销售。如果从广州运砂糖到沈阳再运回关内（保定），仅运费一项即需东北币一四、○一六、六九一、八○○元，这是严重的浪费国家人力、财力的行为。因此，我们随即电报请示中国百货公司，最好将此项砂糖拨交他们，留在关内出售（按：东北百货公司与中国百货公司在一九五○年签订东北进关砂糖合同尚未交清，且合同规定欠数交货地点为保定），唯因东北电报局将电报原文九○○吨，误发为九、○○○吨（东北电报局这种粗枝大叶的工作作风应该检讨——编者），相差悬殊太大，致增加了中国百货公司对这一问题处理上的困难。当我们在这种紧急需要将砂糖运出广州的情况之下，遂决定将运往沈阳的砂糖运到保定。
    第三、此项进口砂糖北运保定是因为我们对全国砂糖运销情况的了解不足。我们仅从东北地区看来，认为砂糖不该运回东北即是节省了国家运输力，同时我们将这批砂糖转运保定，是缺乏正式书面报告也未取得上级公司的批准。因此贵报对我们这次盲目运销的批评，我们完全接受。
    人民日报发表了《盲目运销白糖》的批评，对我们所有贸易工作者都是一个很好的教育，尤其是在加强组织观念，严格请示报告制度上的教育意义更大。我们希望党报今后不断地对我们的工作给予指导和批评。
                                        中国百货公司东北区公司编辑同志：
    二月二日贵报“读者来信”栏所载《东北百货公司盲目运销白糖造成国家损失》一稿，给我们思想上很大的启发与帮助。除东北百货公司已作检讨外，我们也虚心接受这个批评，并作如下的检讨：
    一、东北区百货公司由广州运进食糖时，我公司亦由青岛、天津进口了大批食糖，华北区已感仓库储存条件不够，需要向中南区调运一部。这种国内糖的经营及运销情况的变化，我们未曾事先告知东北百货公司，因而将砂糖运到保定，造成人力、财力的浪费。这是我们应该负一部分责任的。
    二、东北百货公司来电请示，拟将这批进口糖交付我们接收。因电文中把九○○吨误为九、○○○吨，使我们不能及时作出决定。致使东北百货公司将这批食糖运到保定后，河北省百货公司无法接收。这也是我们应该检讨的。
    这次的批评，进一步教育了我们认识到经营管理工作上是不够完善的。今后决定接受这些经验教训，加强干部教育，改善经营管理工作，保证作好我们的国营贸易工作，防止类似事件的再度发生。
                                                中国百货公司
