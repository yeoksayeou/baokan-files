The entire staff of the dubbing departments of the Northeast, Shanghai, and Beijing film studios of the Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau wrote a letter to Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, reporting on their work in 1950. President Liu Shaoqi sent a letter of encouragement in reply. The full text of the two letters is as follows:
            (I) Letter from the dubbing departments of the Northeast, Shanghai, and Beijing film studios of the Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau to Comrade Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association:
    As we are summarizing our work in 1950, we would like to report to you on the translation work of Soviet films over the past year and ask you for criticism and instructions to facilitate the improvement of future work.
    In 1950, in addition to completing the original plan of translating 40 Soviet feature films and 36 Soviet science and education short films, our state-owned Northeast, Shanghai, and Beijing film studios also over-fulfilled the translation of three feature films, "Secret Mission," "Conspiracy," and "How the Steel Was Tempered," to cooperate with the movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The Soviet science and education short films also over-fulfilled the task by six films.
    We are undertaking this work of translating advanced Soviet films into the Chinese language and introducing them to the broad masses of the people with unparalleled enthusiasm and a sincere learning attitude. We deeply feel the significance and importance of this work. Especially today, when the people of China and the Soviet Union are closely united in a firm struggle against aggressors to defend world peace, it is of great significance to widely introduce the great economic and cultural construction of socialist countries, as well as the high patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet people and the typical deeds of their people's heroes, through this concrete work, so as to better learn from the Soviet Union and further strengthen and consolidate the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
    In the past year, our contact with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has not been close enough. Now, while reporting on our work and asking for criticism and instructions, we hope to maintain close contact with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in future work and obtain regular instructions, help, and encouragement.
    All the dubbing workers of our bureau are full of confidence in welcoming the glorious task of translating 60 films in 1951, and vow to work tirelessly to complete this task. With respectful greetings,
    Dubbing departments of the Northeast, Shanghai, and Beijing film studios of the Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau    February 1st
    (II) Reply from President Liu Shaoqi to all working comrades of the dubbing departments of the Northeast, Shanghai, and Beijing film studios of the Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau:
    I was pleased to read your letter of February 1st and learned that in 1950 you completed the original plan of translating 40 Soviet feature films and 36 science and education short films, and also over-fulfilled the task of three feature films and six short films. Thanks to your continuous efforts over the past year, you have overcome difficulties in your work and gradually improved your technology, so that the quality of your products has made significant progress. I am satisfied with the films you have translated. At the same time, you are striving to produce more in quantity, which shows your high sense of responsibility towards your work. Congratulations on your victory in your work!
    Undoubtedly, the young Chinese people's film industry has become an extremely important department in the new China's cultural undertakings. We must not only learn the ideological and artistic qualities of Soviet films, but also learn their militancy, which is inseparable from them. For the past 30 years, Soviet film art has been fighting against bourgeois artistic trends. In the current China, we urgently need to eliminate the poisonous influence of American imperialist films on the Chinese people. Your posts and tasks are obviously even more important.
    I wish you an early completion of the new task of translating 60 films in 1951!
                                        Liu Shaoqi  February 28th

　　电影局三制片厂翻译片工作者报告工作
    中苏友协刘少奇会长复信嘉勉
    指示学习苏联电影的斗争性扫清美国影片的遗毒
    【新华社三日讯】中央文化部电影局东北、上海、北京三制片厂翻译片科全体工作人员写信给中苏友好协会总会刘少奇会长，报告一九五○年一年工作情况，刘少奇会长特复信勉励。两信全文如下：
            （一）中央文化部电影局东北、上海、北京三制片厂翻译片科致
        刘少奇会长的信中苏友好协会少奇同志：
    当我们正在总结一九五○年工作的时候，谨向您报告一年来对苏联影片翻译工作的情况，请求您给予批评与指示，以利今后工作的改进。
    一九五○年，我们国营东北、上海、北京三制片厂除完成原计划翻译四十部苏联故事片，与三十六本苏联科学教育短片外，并为配合抗美援朝保家卫国运动，超额译制了《秘密使节》、《阴谋》与《钢铁是怎样炼成的》三部故事片，苏联科学教育短片也超额完成了六本。
    我们对于把苏联先进影片译成中国语言介绍给广大人民的这一工作，是怀着无比热情与诚恳的学习态度来从事的。我们深深感到这一工作的意义与重要。特别是在中苏两国人民紧密团结为保卫世界和平而向侵略者作坚决斗争的今天，通过这一具体工作广泛地介绍社会主义国家的伟大经济、文化建设以及苏联人民高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神及其人民英雄的典型事迹等，从而更好地向苏联学习，并更进一步地加强巩固中苏两国人民深厚友谊，是有其重要意义的。
    一年来的工作中，我们与中苏友好协会的联系是不够密切的，现在向您汇报工作，请求批评与指示的同时，希望在今后工作中密切与中苏友好协会联系，取得经常的指示、帮助与鼓舞。
    我局全体翻译片工作者满怀信心地迎向一九五一年六十部译制片的光荣任务，并誓为完成这一任务而不遗余力地工作。致以敬礼
    中央文化部电影局东北、上海、北京三制片厂翻译片科同启    二月一日
    （二）刘少奇会长的复信中央文化部电影局东北、上海、北京制片厂翻译片科全体工作同志：
    接读你们二月一日来信，欣悉你们在一九五○年内除完成原计划翻译苏联故事片四十部及科学教育短片三十六部外，并超额完成三部故事片及六本短片。一年来由于你们不断的努力，在工作中克服困难，逐渐改进技术，使出品在质的方面已有显著的进步，我所看到的你们翻译的影片是感到满意的。同时你们在数量上争取多出，这是表示你们对工作的高度自觉性。庆祝你们在工作中的胜利！
    无疑地，年青的中国人民电影，在新中国文化事业上，已成为一个极其重要的部门。我们不仅要学习苏联电影的思想性和艺术性，而且要学习它的与此不可分割的斗争性。苏联电影艺术，三十年来就一直与资产阶级艺术潮流在战斗着。在目前的中国，我们亟须扫清美帝国主义的影片所给予中国人民的遗毒。你们的工作岗位和任务显然是更加重要了。
    我预祝你们一九五一年六十部译制片新的任务及早完成！
                                        刘少奇  二月二十八日
