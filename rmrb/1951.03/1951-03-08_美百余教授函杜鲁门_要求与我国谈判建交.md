　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 7th. TASS, New York, March 5th: The Workers Daily correspondent in Chicago reports: One hundred and eighty-three professors and lecturers from the University of Chicago, Roosevelt College, the Illinois Institute of Technology, and forty-four other universities in the United States have jointly written an open letter to Truman, requesting that he recognize the People's Republic of China and seek to negotiate with China to determine relations. The letter stated: "We believe that the United States should seek to negotiate with China and show as much goodwill as possible to facilitate negotiations. In particular, if the United States wants to make the negotiations successful, it must regard the other party to this negotiation as a sovereign and equal country. We therefore request that you recognize the People's Republic of China" because "only recognition can open up a new path -- a path towards a reasonable and glorious solution and towards peace in the East."

　　Among the famous educators who signed this letter are: Abbott, Professor of Social Service Administration; Carlson, Professor of Physiology; Gertman, Associate Professor of the Institute for the Study of Metals; Harvey Foster, Professor of Education at the University of Chicago; Roemer, Dean and Associate Professor of the Seminary; Beale, Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin; Brameld, Professor of the Philosophy of Education at New York University; Frazier, Professor of Sociology at Howard University; Goodman, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Utah Medical School; Lynd, Professor of Sociology at Columbia University; Mitchell, Professor of Economics at Rutgers University in New Jersey; and Morrison, Professor of Physics at Cornell University.
