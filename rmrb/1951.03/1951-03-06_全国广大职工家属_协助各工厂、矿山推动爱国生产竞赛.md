The work concerning families of workers has been initiated in forty-three cities and thirty-one industrial and mining enterprises across the country. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 454,000 workers' family members and 43,900 households organized nationwide. In regions and industrial systems where workers' family work was initiated earlier or progressed more rapidly, workers' families were organized in the form of worker family representative groups, worker family representative conferences, or worker family committees. The organized workers' families actively participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and assisted factories and mines in further promoting the upsurge of patriotic production emulation.

In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, local trade unions used events closely related to the vital interests of workers' families as themes, and conducted current affairs propaganda to workers' families, penetrating into workers' residences, and aiming at the ideological situation of workers' families. This propaganda greatly enhanced the patriotic enthusiasm of workers' families. Many workers' families changed their "dragging legs" attitude and encouraged their husbands, sons, and daughters to go to the front lines or participate in national defense construction. In two workers' family study classes in Tianjin, thirteen people originally wanted to jump into the river or divorce because their relatives were participating in military cadre schools. After studying, they changed their incorrect ideas and made their relatives happily sign up to participate in military cadre schools. The families of more than 60 Resist America, Aid Korea volunteer soldiers in the Huanggu Tun railway workers' dormitory in Shenyang are determined to maintain their lives with their own production income, and no one asks for help from others. Many workers' families have contributed a lot to Resist America, Aid Korea, and support the front lines. For example, three thousand workers' families in Wuhan lined two thousand cotton-padded coats in half a month. Zhao Da Niang, a worker's family member from the Dongjiqi Factory of the Fuxin Coal Mine in Liaoxi Province, did not go to see her son, whom she had been separated from for four years, and wholeheartedly led the workers' families to make seventy-eight military uniforms in a rush. Workers' families in Fushun City donated more than 8,000 consolation items. Many workers' families also actively participated in air defense, fire prevention, anti-special agent, and anti-bandit work. Workers' families in Northeast coal mines generally organized fire prevention inspection teams, rescue teams, and participated in air defense, patrol, and other work, and actively assisted public security departments in tracking down special agents.

In the patriotic production emulation, contracts were signed between workers' families, and between workers' families and workers, and they enthusiastically challenged each other. The workers' families proposed: Guarantee to encourage workers to stick to their production posts under any circumstances and never "drag their legs"; guarantee to do a good job in housework so that workers can rest on time and not be absent from work without reason; guarantee to do a good job in air defense, fire prevention, anti-special agent, and anti-bandit work so that workers can work with peace of mind and assist workers in striving to be models. More than 20,000 workers' families in Lushun and Dalian were swept into a challenge craze. They all seriously put their fingerprints on the challenge letters. After the workers' families of the Dalian Boiler Factory issued a challenge, the attendance rate of workers increased from 90 percent to 98 percent. In the past, more than 80 workers at the No. 3 Pit of the Northeast Fuguo Mine were often late every day; after the workers' families issued a challenge, the phenomenon of being late disappeared. Chen Shangquan, a large panel machine worker at the Jilin Match Factory, was encouraged by his wife in the production emulation and created three new records in a row. In the 150,000-kilometer safe driving campaign of the Harbin Train Section, workers' families played an important role, and thus received a collective major merit and reward from the administration.

Organizing workers' family production and learning culture is an important way to mobilize workers' families. In the past year, 220,000 workers' family members across the country have participated in sideline production. They have set up sock-shaking, sewing, weaving, and washing production cooperatives or production groups, opened garment shops, steamed bun shops, tofu shops, or participated in land reclamation, etc. The income from sideline production of workers' families in the Jiamusi Power Plant accounts for one-third of the total income of workers' families. Sideline production not only increases the family income of workers, but also promotes family harmony and changes women's view of despising labor. For example, after Wang Zumei, a worker's family member of the Shanghai Garment Factory No. 1, participated in the sewing group, her mother-in-law not only no longer hindered her from going out, but also helped her take care of the children when she went out. Currently, 40,000 workers' family members are participating in cultural learning. Many areas have also organized reading groups. After participating in learning, workers' family members gradually changed their superstitious ideas and improved their political awareness. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, many workers' families became good current affairs propagandists.

In addition, organizing mutual aid groups and giving play to the strength of workers' families to solve the difficulties in their lives is also a good way to carry out the work of workers' families. For example, when workers' families in Majiagou, Tangshan, study culture, they concentrate the children and take turns to take care of them. Mutual aid groups of workers' families in Jiamusi, Xuanhua, and other places plan to cook and take care of children for workers' families who are giving birth or are sick, so that workers can work with peace of mind.

The work concerning families of workers is being carried out under the conditions of a great shortage of cadres. Many trade unions have relied on the strength of workers' families themselves to cultivate and promote activists among workers' families in many ways; therefore, this work can be gradually developed. For example, the Northeast Railway System and Lushun, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places have held 31 training courses for activists of workers' families, training 1,300 workers' family members, making them cadres and backbones in the work of workers' families. Many of them have also participated in local government work. In the Northeast coal mines, the vast majority of lizhang and group leaders are now held by workers' family members.

### 全国广大职工家属  协助各工厂、矿山推动爱国生产竞赛

　　全国广大职工家属
    协助各工厂、矿山推动爱国生产竞赛
    职工家属工作已在全国四十三个城市、三十一个工矿中得到开展。据不完全统计，目前全国已经组织起来的职工家属，有四十五万四千人和四万三千九百户。在职工家属工作开展较早或较快的地区和产业系统中，职工家属都是以工人家属代表小组、工人家属代表会议或工人家属委员会等形式组织起来的。组织起来的职工家属积极地参加了抗美援朝运动，并协助各厂矿进一步推动了爱国主义生产竞赛的热潮。
    各地工会在抗美援朝运动中，曾以职工家属切身利害有关的事件为题材，针对着职工家属的思想情况，深入职工住宅，向职工家属进行时事宣传。这些宣传大大地提高了职工家属的爱国热情。许多职工家属改变了“扯腿”态度，鼓励自己的丈夫、儿女走上前线或参加国防建设。天津市的两个职工家属学习班中原有十三人因自己的亲属参加军事干部学校而要跳河、闹离婚，学习后，改变了不正确的思想，使她们的亲属高高兴兴地去报名参加军事干部学校。沈阳皇姑屯铁路工人宿舍六十几户抗美援朝志愿军的家属决心以自己生产所得来维持生活，没有一家要求别人照顾。很多职工家属在抗美援朝支援前线中尽了很多的力。例如武汉三千个职工家属在半个月内，絮行了两万件棉大衣。辽西省阜新煤矿东机器厂职工家属赵大娘，不去看她分别四年的儿子，一心一意带动职工家属，突击缝制了七十八件军衣。抚顺市职工家属献出了八千多件慰劳品。许多职工家属并积极参加防空、防火、防特务、防匪等工作。东北煤矿的职工家属普遍组织了防火检查组、救护队和参加防空、纠察等工作，并协助公安部门积极追查特务。
    在爱国主义生产竞赛中，职工家属之间、职工家属与职工之间都订立了合同，并热烈地挑战。职工家属们提出：保证在任何情况下，鼓励职工坚持生产岗位，决不“扯腿”：保证搞好家务，使职工按时作息，不无故欠勤；保证做好防空、防火、防特务、防匪工作，使职工安心生产，并协助职工争取当模范。旅大二万多户职工家属卷进了挑战热潮。她们一个个认真地在挑战书上打下指印。大连锅炉厂职工家属挑战后，职工出勤率由百分之九十提高到百分之九十八。东北富国矿三坑过去每天经常有八十多个工友迟到；在职工家属提出挑战后，迟到的现象消灭了。吉林火柴厂大板机工人陈尚权的妻子在生产竞赛中鼓励丈夫连创了三次新纪录。哈尔滨列车段十五万公里安全行驶运动中，职工家属起了重要的作用，因而得到行政上集体记大功和奖励。
    组织职工家属生产和学习文化是发动职工家属的重要方式。一年来全国有二十二万职工家属参加了副业生产。她们开办了摇袜、缝纫、织布、洗浆等生产合作社或生产小组，开设了成衣局、馒头店、豆腐房，或参加开荒等。佳木斯发电厂职工家属副业生产的收入占职工家庭全部收入的三分之一。副业生产不但增加了职工的家庭收入，同时能促使家庭和睦，并改变了妇女轻视劳动的观念。例如上海被服一厂职工家属王祖梅参加缝衣组后，她的婆婆不但不再阻挠她外出，并且在她外出时，还帮助她看孩子。参加文化学习的职工家属目前有四万人。许多地区还组织了读报小组。职工家属们参加学习后，逐渐改变了迷信思想，并提高了政治觉悟。在抗美援朝运动中，不少职工家属成了很好的时事宣传者。
    此外，组织互助组，发挥职工家属自己的力量来解决她们生活中的困难，也是开展职工家属工作的好办法。例如唐山马家沟的职工家属在学习文化时，把孩子集中起来，由几个人轮流看管。佳木斯、宣化等地职工家属互助组有计划地替分娩或有病的职工家属们做饭和看孩子，使职工能够安心生产。
    职工家属工作是在干部非常缺乏的条件下进行的。许多工会都作到依靠职工家属自己的力量，多方面培养和提拔职工家属中的积极分子；因此这一工作能逐步地得到开展。如东北铁路系统和旅大、天津、青岛等地曾举办了三十一期职工家属积极分子训练班，训练了一千三百名职工家属。使她们成为职工家属工作中的干部和骨干。其中不少人还参加了地方政权工作。东北煤矿中，绝大部分闾长、组长已由职工家属担任。（新华社）
