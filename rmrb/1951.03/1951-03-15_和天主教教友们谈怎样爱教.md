To all Catholic parishioners, priests, monks and nuns:

Today we stand before God to discuss issues that we as Catholics should address. What I want to talk about concerns the Holy Church, not any individual. You all know much more than I do; what I offer is merely a humble contribution.

Please take a look at the current position of our Church in society. We ourselves believe that the faith cannot be spread. Public opinion is very negative towards us. Whenever Catholicism is mentioned, people immediately associate it with imperialism, viewing our Church as a tool for imperialist aggression against China and considering us to be bad people. Fortunately, the government has issued explicit statements guaranteeing freedom of religious belief, which has allowed our Church to continue to exist today. Imperialist elements say, "The Communist Party's religious freedom is fake." This propaganda creates a serious sense of opposition between our Catholic parishioners and the government. Religion in China is not limited to Catholicism; there are many followers of other religions, such as Islam and Buddhism, who are all protected by the government. Isn't this the greatest ironclad proof that the government allows freedom of religious belief? The dissatisfaction with the Holy Church in society today is due to historical roots!

First, let us look at the history of imperialist aggression against China. The series of unequal treaties imposed on us by imperialists all explicitly included the privilege of missionary freedom (please refer to pages 300-304 of Modern Chinese History). For example, the Treaty of Wangxia in 1844 gave American imperialism not only customs agreements, inland river navigation, and inland travel privileges, but also freedom to preach. In the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860), the Anglo-French allied forces occupied Beijing and added several articles to the treaty with the Qing government. Article 6 originally stipulated "missionaries are still allowed to preach," but the French missionary serving as translator secretly added the phrase "French missionaries are free to rent and buy land in all provinces to build as they please." The Qing Emperor was昏聩(confused and muddle-headed) and signed it. After the ninth year of Guangxu (1883), German Chancellor Bismarck, seeing the aggressive benefits other countries gained from missionary work in China, also supported German missionaries to come to China and preach in Shandong. In the twenty-third year of Guangxu (1897), the Big Sword Society killed two German Catholic priests, and the German government immediately sent troops to occupy Jiaozhou. These facts naturally make people from all sectors of Chinese society feel that Catholicism is related to imperialist aggression.

Second, let's look at how the actions of imperialists in spreading religion in China violated the holy will of God. Taking Tianjin as an example:

1. After World War I, Bishop Dumont (a Frenchman) of Xikai forcibly planted the French flag on Xikai, seizing Chinese territory and turning it into a French concession. During the Xikai Church incident, the Zhangzhuang Bridge Police Station was staffed with Chinese police officers. Bishop Dumont (a Frenchman) led French soldiers to intimidate them, and the police fled in the night. Furthermore, Fathers Tang and Lei were opposed to French imperialists occupying Xikai, which angered Bishop Dumont, who dispatched French soldiers to search the Wanghailou Catholic Church. Fortunately, Fathers Tang and Lei had been forewarned and hid in the homes of parishioners, thus escaping the danger, but they were ultimately stripped of their authority and expelled from China.

2. Before the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, when the Yi Shi Bao newspaper, published in the Italian concession, criticized French imperialism, Bishop Wen (a Frenchman, still in office) of Xikai, through the Italian consul, ordered the Yi Shi Bao to suspend publication for several days.

3. During World War II, Bishop Wen GuiBin, the French bishop of Xikai, wanted to sell the property of the Helou Catholic Church. Because Father Ma (a Chinese) of Helou objected, Father Ma was stripped of his priestly authority. This was a pure abuse of religious authority that tarnished the sanctity of Catholicism. Such a selfish bishop is also a great disgrace to God.

4. During the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, I took refuge in the Catholic Church in Qingyuan County, Shanxi. Japanese soldiers openly beat, scolded, and killed refugees in the church. The Italian Father Lei not only did not sympathize with our refugees' suffering, but instead said, "You Chinese are all bandits, without government. The Japanese should come and manage you." This is the fascist ideology of Germany, Japan, and Italy, thoroughly defiling the purity of the Holy Church.

5. The brutal behavior of imperialists towards colonies is beyond imagination, such as America's treatment of blacks, Native Americans, and Koreans; France's treatment of Vietnamese people; and Italy's treatment of Abyssinians. However, we rarely hear imperialist elements in the guise of missionaries advocate for justice or say a few fair words, criticizing the actions of imperialist aggression and enslavement of humanity. On the contrary, many speak for imperialism: obedience is necessary, revolution violates the Fourth Commandment, and is the work of the devil.

6. Catholicism is like pure white rice that has been tainted and mixed with sand by imperialist encroachment. For example, the Shengxin Hospital in the old Italian concession in Tianjin was called the Italian Hospital by the masses; the Xikai Catholic Church Hospital was called the French Church and the French Hospital by the masses. Imperialists took advantage of the privilege of preaching in China, so that churches scattered across the country were almost like concessions, making our international relations more serious and complicated, and deepening the disasters of the Chinese people. For example, in the Portuguese occupation of Macau, the German occupation of Qingdao, and the invasion war of the Eight-Power Allied Forces, tens of thousands of Chinese people died due to Catholic issues.

Imperialist elements in the guise of missionaries, such as French Bishop Wen GuiBin and Dutch priest Zheng HuaMin of Tianjin, told parishioners that the Communist Party is "the devil" and "beasts," and that they must never cooperate with or reconcile with the Communist Party until death. Little do they know that humans have existed for 500,000 years, of which 494,000 years were spent living in primitive communist societies. Private ownership systems have only existed for the past five or six thousand years. If communism is "the devil" and "beasts," then not only have we all become descendants of the devil, but even our Lord Jesus has been slandered by imperialists. Furthermore, the Holy Church says that the root of human sin comes from the seven deadly sins. In fact, the seven deadly sins are produced by economic inequality under the private ownership system, which creates classes. The wealthy exploit and plunder the poor, leading to murder, abduction, and deception. The poor rise up in resistance, which is a last resort for the poor and deeply saddens God. A communist society is an equal, free, peaceful, and democratic society, which is exactly the society of loving others as oneself that Jesus advocated. This is a society without sin. Imperialist elements in the guise of missionaries slander a communist society and insist on maintaining the evil society of Wall Street, which is true cooperation with the devil. Therefore, Chinese priests say: "He dies for it, he dies for imperialism. His death does not lead to heaven, but is guaranteed to lead to hell."

Wen GuiBin, Zheng HuaMin, and others also slander the "Three-Self" (self-propagation, self-support, self-government) movement as apostasy and separation from the Pope.

Popes Pius XI and Benedict XV had repeatedly ordered that the Chinese manage their own church affairs (please refer to Pope Pius XI's address to foreign missionaries in China on February 28, 1926, the fifth year of his pontificate, in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome; Pope Benedict XV's address to foreign missionaries in China on November 30, 1919, the sixth year of his pontificate, in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome). Regardless of whether we can rely on these instructions to achieve true self-reliance and reform, the imperialist elements such as Wen GuiBin have consistently opposed these instructions, hiding them from the Chinese people and slandering the Chinese people to Rome, saying that they are ignorant and dim-witted and do not have the qualifications to be elevated to bishops. They not only opposed these instructions from the Pope, but later, when Archbishop Celso Costantini elevated Chinese people to be bishops and supported Chinese self-government, imperialist elements even slandered Bishop Costantini as the devil. How much more so when we promote the "Three-Self" movement, self-reliance, and reform! Father Liu FuDong of the South Church in Beijing said, "Not to mention you, even today some people say that Bishop Costantini is the devil. Bishop Costantini is now the Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in Rome. Would the devil become the Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith?" It is very obvious that the imperialist elements Wen GuiBin, Zheng HuaMin, and others oppose Archbishop Costantini and our "Three-Self" movement not for the sake of the Holy Church, but for their own personal interests. Judas betrayed Jesus to the Pharisees for his own benefit. The Pharisees, the leaders of the Tordeh Church, crucified Jesus for their own personal interests. Modern imperialist elements in the guise of missionaries and their pawns are selling Catholicism to imperialism for their own personal interests, stubbornly slandering the "Three-Self" movement as apostasy. They want to permanently control Chinese Catholicism and enslave the Chinese people. They are also hoping day and night for the outbreak of a third world war, hoping that American imperialism will use atomic bombs, constantly creating rumors and engaging in espionage activities. The espionage cases in Xianxian, Shenyang, and other places are sufficient to prove that they are no different from Judas. All Catholic parishioners who love God must not only reject the fallacies of imperialist elements, but must also love the country and the Church, support the "Three-Self" movement, and strive for the early realization of self-reliance and reform.

Below, I will discuss how to observe the Fourth Commandment of God and obey the authority of the clergy and the orders of superiors. I believe that we should obey the authority of the clergy and the orders of superiors for the benefit of God, because we are obeying God, not the individual. Blindly obeying without distinguishing right from wrong is equivalent to obeying the authority of the Pharisees and Judas. Among the twelve apostles personally educated by Jesus, there was Judas. If we only look at religious authority, who dares to deny that Judas's religious authority was high and great? Would we also obey Judas if he betrayed Jesus? Do not just look at his missionary clothing and fail to recognize his imperialist behavior. On the morning of January 20, 1951, Bishop Wen GuiBin said, "When you talk about loving the country, do not talk about loving the Church." With the qualifications of a bishop's religious authority, he actually ordered the parishioners not to talk about loving the Church, and I do not know where his faith lies. He simply has no Catholic flavor, let alone the religious authority of a bishop. If we were to obey this kind of religious authority, turning love of the Church into harming the Church, this is not allowed by every Catholic parishioner who reveres God. Austin's absurd remarks in the Security Council openly regarded Catholicism as his tool of aggression. This insulted God and our Holy Church. We are Catholic parishioners, we should oppose Austin's absurd remarks, and wash away the insults to God given by imperialists in history. However, some parishioners who do not understand the situation still quibble for imperialism: "No one can represent the Church, and Catholics do not participate in politics." He does not realize that as a member of the Catholic community, he has the obligation and the duty to wash away the insult to God. If he would rather God be insulted, it shows that what he believes in is already the religion of imperialism, not Catholicism. What bad thing is it to wash away the insults to God? They say that the Communist Party does not believe in God, but does the Communist Party believe in other gods? Obviously, the Communist Party does not believe in Buddhist or Taoist gods either. Saying that the Communist Party opposes Catholicism, does no other religion oppose Catholicism? The government advocates freedom of religious belief and does not oppose our belief in Catholicism, but opposes imperialist elements using Catholicism to commit crimes and do evil and act recklessly. Today, our government is the people's own government, unlike any government of previous dynasties. The people are the masters, everything is for the people. Just look at the great achievements in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects in the short period of two years since liberation, and you can fully prove that our government is different from any capitalist government in the world. This is an ironclad fact that no patriotic Chinese people will deny. However, since liberation, Wen GuiBin, Zheng HuaMin, and others have slandered the Communist Party as the devil and the People's Government as the devil. They do not want peace, they fear that our China will be well-constructed, prosperous, strong, and happy, and they hope for war and the use of atomic bombs. With such a brutal and barbaric mentality, who is the devil? There is no doubt that the war criminals on Wall Street who kill with artillery and atomic bombs are the devils, and those who speak for Wall Street are the devil's pawns. American imperialism bombed peaceful residents in Korea. Not only did they not oppose the evil actions of American imperialist demons with human sympathy, but they also happily said, "They should be bombed, and the devils should be wiped out." They have turned the devil into a kind and good friend, and millions of kind people into devils. This imperialist brutality is truly inhuman, truly a traitor to our country, an enemy of the people, and a disgrace to the Holy Church.

Our Lord Jesus said, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." Jesus's father was a carpenter, and his mother was a spinner. Jesus helped his father do carpentry work until he was thirty years old. Jesus's entire advocacy was for equality and universal love, opposing the wealthy and powerful. The Ten Commandments of God can be summarized into two: love God above all else, and love your neighbor as yourself, opposing man's oppression of man. These imperialist elements speak of loving God, but all they do are brutal imperialist acts. Are they not the Pharisees that Jesus condemned? They distort the truth of God with imperialist things, harm the Holy Church, harm our motherland, and deceive our good parishioners. This is intolerable to every brave soldier of our Lord Jesus.

During the Tianjin Liberation War on January 14, 1949, Father He (a Chinese) preached in the Yixingbu Catholic Church outside the Tianjin city defense. Chen Changjie, commander of the Kuomintang bandit gang, cleared the field of fire and drove away the residents of Yixingbu, burning down their houses. Father He had no choice but to withdraw to the Xikai General Church. Bishop Wen GuiBin immediately forced him to return to Yixingbu. Father He was forced back by the fighting troops on the street. While eating in the dining hall, Father He asked Bishop Wen to stay in the home of a parishioner near Xikai. Bishop Wen said, "You are not a priest." Bishop Wen and the foreign priests rushed up and pushed, pulled, and tore, intending to drive Father He out of the churchyard. After the meal, the foreign priests and bishop all left their seats and entered the church to pray. Father He and the Chinese priests who sympathized with him sat quietly in the dining hall in stalemate. Bishop Wen, because his wishes were not fulfilled, immediately returned to the dining hall and said, "You Chinese are not priests." Please, in all conscience, which of God's Ten Commandments did these Chinese priests violate, which rule of the Holy Church did they violate? Just because they made a slight plea against the orders of imperialism, they were threatened with being stripped of their priesthood!

Because the Yixingbu Church was destroyed by artillery fire, Father He still lives in a thatched hut with two rooms on the riverbank outside the city defense, one room for sleeping and the other for celebrating Mass, which is known as the first democratic church in the world. We can see that the good parishes in Tianjin are all foreign priests, and some foreign priests wear beautiful suits, ride electric donkeys, and live in small palaces. The treatment of Chinese and foreign priests is like heaven and hell. In general, when dealing with problems, people still know a great impartiality, even the昏王（muddle-headed rulers） of history knew the prince was subject to the same laws as the commoners. However, Wen GuiBin, who holds the great power of the bishop, recites scriptures and says Mass every day, speaks of loving your neighbor as yourself, and cannot stop talking of heaven and hell, is doing things that harm God and harm the world! If he treats God and the priests like this, one can imagine how he treats the Catholic parishioners and the Chinese people. The reason why the Holy Church in China has fallen to such a state is all due to such imperialist elements! China in the twentieth century was China invaded by various imperialists, and the Catholic Church in China in the twentieth century was also the Catholic Church invaded and tainted by imperialism. In order to love the country and the Church, we must eliminate the imperialist elements that harm the country and the Church. The "Three-Self" movement, self-reliance and reform, was put forward under this specific situation. The target of reform is imperialism, not God and the Roman Pope. The imperialist elements stubbornly slander the "Three-Self" movement as betraying and separating from the Pope, and announce that those who sign it will go to hell. When we argued with them, they were unable to justify themselves and denied it, saying, "Stopping from doing good deeds leading to hell is temporary, and we will sign together with Beijing in the future." Everyone knows that heaven and hell are eternal, but now there is an imperialist temporary hell. Therefore, Chinese priests said, "I refuse to go to your imperialist hell, I will definitely go to God's heaven!" Only imperialist elements and their lackeys go to hell!

Fellow parishioners, in the future, when the "Three-Self" movement is universally launched across the country and implemented in Tianjin, where will he write down the account of his previous declaration of apostasy and going to hell? This shows that imperialists are all talking nonsense, replacing the truth of God with imperialist thoughts. Therefore, Chinese priests said, "The imperialists have turned God's Ten Commandments into one commandment, that is, to worship imperialism above all else. The imperialist elements are making fun of the truth of God and distorting the dogma. The depth of their sin is even greater than that of Lucifer."

The above is discussed in three parts. The first part is how imperialism historically used Catholicism as a tool for aggression against China. The second part is how imperialism infringed upon and tainted Catholicism, distorted Catholic doctrine, and is still deceiving and fooling parishioners, attempting to continue imperialist activities. The third part is that our Catholic parishioners in the Tianjin area have recognized the true face of imperialism and launched an irreconcilable struggle against imperialism. We are Chinese, we are Catholic parishioners, we should love the country, love the Church, and oppose imperialism. The imperialist elements Wen GuiBin, Zheng HuaMin, and others oppose our love of the country and the Church and undermine the "Three-Self" movement. We must resolutely fight them to the end and throw them into the twelfth level of hell.

We are not xenophobic either. Many kind foreign missionaries gave up their families and worked faithfully to spread the gospel of God to us. We should pray to God to bless them more; and they also oppose the insults to God given by these imperialist elements. We hope that these kind foreign missionaries will stay in China and worship God together with us.

Our "Three-Self" reform movement has the support of the people of the whole country in front of us and the support of more than three million Catholics behind us. Victory belongs to us. Victory is already in sight. Long live! Long live to God's greater glory! Long live Chairman Mao!

专栏：

　　和天主教教友们谈怎样爱教
    天津津沽大学教授  张羽时诸位教友们、神父修士修女们：
    我们今天站在天主面前，谈一谈我们教友立场应当谈的问题。我所要谈的，都是圣教会的问题，并不是那一个人的问题。大家比我知道的多，我谈的不过做为引玉之砖。
    请看一看今天我们的教，在社会上的地位已经落到什么田地？我们自己都认为教不能传。社会对我们舆论很坏，每一提起天主教，就联想到帝国主义，把我们教会都看成是帝国主义侵略中国的工具，认为我们是坏人。幸有政府信教自由的明文公布，使我们的教，今天尚能存在。帝国主义分子说：“共产党信教自由是假的。”这种宣传，造成我们教友与政府严重对立的心理。在中国的宗教不只是一个天主教，其他宗教信仰者尚多的很，如回教、佛教等，都得到政府的保护，这还不是政府允许信教自由最大的铁证吗？圣教会，今天遭到社会舆论的不满，是由于历史根源所造成的！
    第一、我们首先掀开帝国主义侵略中国史看一看，帝国主义对我们订立的一连串的不平等条约中，都明文载着传教自由的特权（请参看中国近代史三○○——三○四页）。比如一八四四年的望厦条约，美帝国主义除取得海关协定、内河航行、内地游历等特权外，还有自由传教一条。咸丰十年（一八六○年）英法联军侵占北京，与满清政府增订条约数条，条约第六条原议“仍准教士传教”，当时充翻译的法国传教士，私添“法国传教士在各省租买田地建造自便”一句，清帝昏聩、糊涂，签字承认。光绪九年（一八八三年）以后，德国首相俾士麦见各国在华传教得到侵略利益，因亦扶持德传教士来华，在山东传教。光绪二十三年（一八九七年）大刀会杀德天主教士二人，德政府即出兵强占胶澳。这些事实，当然容易使中国各方社会人士感觉天主教与帝国主义侵略有关。
    第二、我们再看帝国主义者在中国传教的行动是违反了天主的圣意的。即以天津一地而言：
    １、第一次世界战后，西开杜主教（法国人）硬把西开插上法国国旗，强占中国领土，变为法国租界。西开教堂事件发生之时，张庄大桥驻有中国警察厅派出所，杜主教（法国人）率法国兵前往威吓，警察们夤夜逃出。又汤雷二神父因反对法国帝国主义霸占西开，致遭杜主教之怒，遣使法国兵到望海楼天主堂搜捕。幸汤雷二神父事先闻知，藏匿于教友家中，始免于难，但终因此被摘权，而驱逐出中国境。
    ２、中国抗日战争前，益世报在意租界出版时，指责了法国帝国主义，西开文主教（法国人，现仍在任）通过了意国领事官，勒令益世报停刊数日。
    ３、第二次世界战时，西开法籍主教文贵宾主教要将河楼天主堂房产变卖，因河楼马神父（中国人）反对，因而把马神父神权褫掉。这纯是滥用神权玷污了天主教的圣洁。这种自私自利的主教，对天主也是莫大的耻辱。
    ４、中国抗日战争期间，我在山西清源县天主堂避难，日本兵在堂里公然打骂杀砍难民。那位雷神父（意国人），不仅不同情我们难民沦陷之痛，反而说：“你们中国人都是土匪，无政府，日本人应当来管你们。”这是德日义法西斯的思想，透顶地玷污了圣教会的纯洁。
    ５、帝国主义对殖民地的残暴行为是出乎意料的。如美国对黑人对印第安人对朝鲜人，法国对越南人，意国对阿比西尼亚人等。可是我们很少听到外披传教士衣服的帝国主义分子，主张公理说几句公道话，指责帝国主义侵略与奴役人类的行动。相反的很多是替帝国主义说话：要服从，革命就是犯四诫，就是魔鬼。
    ６、天主教譬如是洁白的大米饭，被帝国主义侵害玷污，掺上了砂子。比如天津旧意租界圣心医院，群众称为意国医院；西开天主堂天主教医院，群众称为法国教堂法国医院。帝国主义利用在华传教特权，致使散布在全国的教堂，几乎形同租界，使我国际关系更加严重复杂化，加深了中华人民的灾难。如葡占澳门，德占青岛及八国联军的侵略战争中就有数以万计的中华人民生灵，死于天主教问题。
    外披着传教士衣服的帝国主义分子，如天津法籍主教文贵宾、荷籍教士郑化民等，向教友传播说：共产党是“魔鬼”是“畜类”，至死不能与共产党合作，与共产党誓不两立。殊不知人类已有五十万年的历史，其中是四十九万四千年是度着原始共产生活的，近五六千年来才有了私有制度，如果说共产主义就是“魔鬼”“畜类”，那么不仅我们都成了魔鬼的子孙，就连吾主耶稣也被帝国主义所污蔑了。再则圣教会说人犯罪的根源，是由七罪宗来的，其实七罪宗的产生，是由私有制度的经济不平等，产生了阶级而产生的，富豪人对穷苦人剥削抢夺，生杀拐骗，穷苦人起而反抗，这是穷苦人不得已，也是天主最伤心的。共产主义社会是个平等、自由、和平、民主的社会，正是耶稣所主张的爱人如己的社会，这个社会是没有罪恶的。外披传教士衣服的帝国主义分子反而诬蔑共产主义社会，硬要维持华尔街万恶的社会，这才是真正的与魔鬼合作。因此中国神父说：“他致命，他为帝国主义致命吧，他致命不是升天堂，保险下地狱。”
    文贵宾、郑化民等又诬蔑“三自”（自传、自养、自治。下同）运动是背教，脱离教宗。
    教宗比约第十一，本笃第十五，都曾三令五申的让中国人自己治理自己国的教务（请参看教宗比约十一于一九二六年二月二十八日即位之第五年于罗马伯多禄堂，颁致在中国的外国传教士通牒；教宗本笃第十五于一九一九年十一月三十日即位之第六年在罗马伯多禄堂。颁致在中国的外国传教士通牒）。姑无论我们能否依靠这些指令来实现真正的自立革新，但帝国主义分子文贵宾之流是一贯反对这些指令的，一直隐藏着这些指令，不让中国人知道，并且向罗马奏摺，诬中国人民愚钝昏聩，说没有升主教的资格。他们不仅反对教宗这些指令，后来刚恒毅大主教因为提升了中国人当主教，扶植中国人自治，帝国主义分子还诬蔑刚主教是魔鬼。何况我们提倡“三自”运动，自立革新呢！北京南堂刘福栋神父说：“不用说你们，到今天还有人说刚主教是魔鬼哩。刚主教现任罗马传信部秘书长，难道魔鬼当了教宗传信部秘书长吗？”这就很明显了，帝国主义分子文贵宾、郑化民等反对刚恒毅大主教，反对我们的“三自”运动，不是为了圣教会，而是从他们个人利益出发的。茹达斯（犹大）就为了自己的利益，把耶稣出卖给法利赛人了，法利赛铎德教主们为了个人利益，把耶稣钉死在十字架上了。现代外披着传教士衣服的帝国主义分子及其走狗们，为了个人利益，把天主教出卖给帝国主义了，硬诬蔑“三自”运动为背教，这是想永远把持中国天主教，奴役中国人民。他们并日夜希望三次世界大战爆发，希望美帝国主义使用原子弹，经常造谣破坏，进行间谍特务活动。献县沈阳等地间谍案，就足证明他们与茹达斯没有两样。凡是敬爱天主的教友，不仅要唾弃帝国主义分子的谬论，一定还要爱国爱教，拥护“三自”运动，力促自立革新早日实现。
    以下我再谈谈，应如何遵守天主第四诫，服从神权和长上命令的问题。我认为应当以天主的利益服从神权和长上的命令，因我们服从的是天主，不是服从的那一个人。如不辨是非的盲目服从，等于服从法利赛人及茹达斯的神权了。耶稣亲自教育的十二个宗徒当中，还有一个茹达斯哩。如果只从神权来看，谁敢不承认茹达斯的神权高而且大呢？难道茹达斯出卖了耶稣，我们也服从吗？不要只看他外披着传教士的衣服，就认不清他帝国主义的行为。一九五一年一月二十日上午文贵宾主教说：“你们谈爱国，不要谈爱教。”以主教神权的资格，竟命令教友不要谈爱教，不知其信德何在。他简直毫无教友气味，更谈不到主教神权了。如果要服从了这种神权，把爱教变为害教，这是每一敬爱天主的教友所不允许的。奥斯汀在安理会的谰言，公开把天主教当作他的侵略工具，这是污辱了天主，污辱了我们圣教会。我们是教友，我们应当反对奥斯汀这种谰言，洗掉历史上帝国主义者给天主的污辱。但是有些认识不清的教友，还给帝国主义诡辩：“谁也不能代表教会，天主教徒不参加政治。”他不想他是教友一分子，就有义务也有本分给天主洗掉污辱。如果他宁愿天主受污辱，说明他所信的，已经是帝国主义教，而不是天主教了。给天主洗掉污辱，这算什么不好的事呢？说共产党不信神，那么共产党信别的神吗？很明显地共产党也不信佛道等神。说共产党反对天主教，难到别的教就不反对天主教吗？政府是主张信教自由的，并不反对我们信天主教，而是反对帝国主义分子利用天主教来犯罪作恶，胡作非为。今天我们的政府是人民自己的政府，不同于以前任何朝代的政府。人民作了主人，一切为了人民，只要看看解放后短短二年多来在政治上，经济上，文化上等各方面的伟大成就，就可以充分证明我们的政府，不同于世界上任何资本主义国家的政府的。这是铁一般的事实，是任何有爱国心的中国人民也不会否认的。但是自解放后，文贵宾、郑化民等，却诬蔑共产党是魔鬼，人民政府是魔鬼。他们不希望和平，怕我们中国好好建设、富强康乐起来，而希望战争，希望使用原子弹。这样残暴野蛮的心理，请问谁是魔鬼？毫无疑问的，是用炮火原子弹杀人的华尔街的战犯们，才是魔鬼，替华尔街说话的人，就是魔鬼的爪牙。美帝国主义轰炸朝鲜和平居民，他们不仅没有以人类同情心来反对美帝国主义恶魔的行动，他反而高兴地说：“应当炸，把魔鬼炸完了。”把魔鬼当成了善良至友，把千百万善良的人民，当成了魔鬼。这种帝国主义的残暴，真是毫无人性，真是我国的奸贼，人民的公敌，圣教会的败类。
    吾主耶稣说：“有钱的人升天堂就如骆驼钻针眼。”耶稣的父亲是个木匠，母亲是个纺线的。耶稣到三十岁，一直帮助父亲做木匠活。耶稣全部主张是平等，博爱，反对有财有势的人。天主十诫，总归二者，爱天主至上，及爱人如己，反对人压迫人。他们这些帝国主义分子们口口声声讲爱天主，但所做的都是帝国主义凶残的行为，这还不是耶稣指责的法利赛人吗？他们以帝国主义的东西来歪曲天主的道理，害了圣教会，害了我们的祖国，欺骗了我们善良的教民，这是为每个吾主耶稣的勇兵所不能容忍的。
    一九四九年一月十四日天津解放战争时，何神父（中国人）在天津城防外宜兴埠天主堂传教。国民党匪帮司令陈长捷，扫除射界，把宜兴埠居民赶光，房子烧毁。何神父不得已撤回西开总堂。文贵宾主教立逼其回宜兴埠。何神父走到街上，被作战军队逼回。在饭厅吃饭时，何神父向文主教要求在西开附近教友家存身。文主教说：“你不是神父。”文主教及外国神父蜂涌而上，推扯撕拉，意图将何神父驱出堂院。饭后外国神父及主教均离座入堂念经，何神父及同情者中国神父均在饭厅静坐相持。文主教因己愿未逞，立即返回饭厅说：“你们中国人，都不是神父。”请凭良心，这些中国神父，违犯了天主十诫的那一诫，违犯了圣教会那一条规矩？只因对帝国主义的命令，稍作哀求表示，即遭受褫夺神权的威胁！
    因宜兴埠教堂毁于炮火，何神父现在还住在城防外河堤上两间草窝铺里，一头作为睡眠之地，一头做弥撒，号称天下民主第一堂。我们再看天津的好堂口，都是外国神父，并有些外国神父穿着漂亮的西服，骑着电驴子，住的像小皇宫一样。中外神父的待遇一个是天堂，一个是地狱。一般人处理问题，还知道一个大公无私，就是历史上的昏王，还有二个王子犯法，一路同罪。但掌有主教大权的文贵宾，每日念经做弥撒，讲爱人如己，嘴巴离不开天堂地狱，竟做的是上害天主，下害世人的事情！对天主，对神父都这样，对教友对中国人民更可想而知。圣教会在中国落到现在这般田地，都是这种帝国主义分子招引来的！二十世纪的中国，是被各帝国主义侵略的中国，二十世纪中国的天主教，亦是被帝国主义所侵害玷污的天主教。我们为了爱国爱教，必须清除害国害教的帝国主义分子。“三自”运动，自立革新，是在这个具体情况下提出的。革新的对象是帝国主义，不是天主和罗马教宗。帝国主义分子硬诬蔑“三自”运动为背叛脱离教宗，并宣布签名者下地狱。我们向其理论，他理屈词穷的抵赖说：“停止神功下地狱是暂时的，将来我们和北京一齐签名。”大家都知道天堂和地狱是永远的，而今又出了一个帝国主义的暂时的地狱，因此中国神父说：“我偏不下你帝国主义的地狱，我定要升天主的天堂！”只有帝国主义分子和他们的走狗，才下地狱！
    诸位教友们，将来“三自”运动全国普遍展开，天津也实行了，请问他以前宣布的叛教下地狱的那一笔账写在那里？这说明帝国主义者尽是信口雌黄，以帝国主义的思想代替了天主的道理。因此中国神父说：“帝国主义者把天主十诫变成了一诫，即一钦崇帝国主义至上了。帝国主义分子拿天主的道理开玩笑，歪曲教义，其罪恶之深已驾于路济弗尔之上。”
    以上谈的共三部分。第一部分是帝国主义从历史上如何利用天主教做为侵华工具。第二部分是帝国主义如何侵害与玷污了天主教，歪曲了天主教义，而今仍欺骗愚弄教友，企图继续作帝国主义活动，第三部分是我们天津地区教友已认清了帝国主义真面目，向帝国主义展开了不调和的斗争。我们是中国人，我们是教友，我们应当爱国爱教反对帝国主义。帝国主义分子文贵宾、郑化民之流反对我们爱国爱教，破坏“三自”运动，我们要坚决与之斗争到底，把他们抛到十二层地狱里去。
    我们也并不是排外。很多善良的外国传教士，抛家舍业，忠心耿耿的为了传教，给我们带来了天主福音，我们应多为他们求天主降福他们；并且他们同样也反对这些帝国主义分子给予天主的污辱。我们希望这些善良的外国传教士仍留在中国和我们共同信奉天主。
    我们的“三自”革新运动，有全国人民对我们支援于前，三百余万教胞支援于后，胜利是属于我们的。胜利已经在望。万岁！为天主扩大光荣万岁！毛主席万岁！
