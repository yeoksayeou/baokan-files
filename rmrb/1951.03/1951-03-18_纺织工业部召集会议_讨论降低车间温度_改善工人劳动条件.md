Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Central Ministry of Textile Industry invited representatives of textile technicians from various regions to hold a meeting to solve the problem of excessively high temperature and humidity in workshops, which is common in textile factories across the country and affects workers' health. Such a meeting to improve workers' labor conditions is the first of its kind in various industries across the country, and it is also unprecedented in the history of China's textile industry.

The meeting was held on February 16th. Based on the reports from representatives from various regions, the meeting thoroughly studied the issue of improving air conditioning equipment, and finally made a resolution to lower the temperature in textile factories in various regions this summer. After the temperature in textile factories is lowered, the humidity will also decrease accordingly. The resolution states that each region should improve air conditioning equipment on a factory-by-factory basis. State-owned factories must formulate plans based on the specific conditions of their factories at the factory management committee level and assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for implementation. Private factories should do this work through labor-management consultation meetings. Plans should be completed before April 10th, and efforts should be made to complete all work by mid-June. The meeting also made specific regulations regarding the workshop temperature of textile factories this summer.

In addition, the meeting also discussed the issue of improving safety equipment in textile factories.

　　纺织工业部召集会议
    讨论降低车间温度
    改善工人劳动条件
    【新华社十七日讯】中央纺织工业部邀请各地纺织技术人员代表举行会议，解决目前各地纺织厂中普遍存在的车间温度和湿度过高，影响工人健康的问题。像这样改善工人劳动条件的会议，在全国各产业中还是第一次，也是中国纺织工业史上从来没有过的。
    会议在二月十六日召开。会议根据各地代表的报告，详细地研究了关于改善空气调节设备的问题，最后作出今年夏季各地纺织厂降低温度的决议。纺织厂的温度降低以后，湿度也就会随之降低。决议内容是：各地应以厂为单位，改进空气调节设备。国营厂须在工厂管理委员会上，根据本厂情况制定计划，推定专人负责执行。私营厂应通过劳资协商会议来做好这个工作。四月十日前要做好计划，争取在六月中全部完成。对于今年夏季各纺织厂的车间温度，会议也作了具体规定。
    此外会议还讨论了关于改善纺织厂安全设备的问题。
