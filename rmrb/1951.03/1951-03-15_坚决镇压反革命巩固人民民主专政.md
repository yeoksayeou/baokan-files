Resolutely Suppress Counter-revolutionaries and Consolidate the People's Democratic Dictatorship
Central People's Government Supreme People's Court President Shen Junru

The Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China have been promulgated and implemented by order of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government. These regulations were formulated in accordance with Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and they vividly embody the interests of our great People's Republic of China and its people. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, after more than 30 years of bloody sacrifice and heroic struggle, finally defeated domestic and foreign enemies, overthrew the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and established a state of the people's democratic dictatorship. "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power," but "the seizure of power is only the beginning of things," because consolidating and building revolutionary power, protecting and developing the fruits of the people's victory, requires more and more arduous work than seizing power from the reactionaries. Moreover, the overthrown reactionary classes are not reconciled to their demise; they are still making a desperate struggle, plotting a restoration. The historical facts of the two years since the establishment of the Central People's Government fully demonstrate that, on the one hand, every step taken by the people's governments at all levels and the people of the whole country in military, political, economic, and cultural work in accordance with the Common Program is aimed at strengthening the people's democratic power and developing the people's democratic cause. On the other hand, domestic and foreign enemies continue to launch desperate counterattacks against our people's state from both outside and inside, destroying the people's democratic power and undermining the people's democratic cause. Since the launch of the war of aggression against Korea by US imperialism, this kind of counter-revolutionary activity has become even more blatant and rampant. If the US imperialist war of aggression were allowed to gain momentum and counter-revolutionary elements continue to act recklessly, the people would suffer, and the revolution would fail. Therefore, it is only natural that the people cheer for the good leadership in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and at the same time demand the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

The People's Court is one of the weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship, and its most fundamental task is to suppress reactionaries, protect the people, and consolidate state power. We must examine the fact that we have not done enough in the work of punishing counter-revolutionaries in the past, and in some places, it can be said that we have done it very poorly. The people accuse us of being "boundlessly lenient." This accusation stems from the people's fear that their beloved motherland will be harmed by counter-revolutionaries, and that the revolutionary fruits they have won and the beautiful life they are working hard to build will be destroyed by counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, it is an attitude of responsibility to the people for our People's Courts to face up to the shortcomings and errors in our work and strive to overcome them. After the State Council and this Court jointly issued the Instructions on Suppressing Counter-revolutionary Activities on July 23 last year, this Court convened a meeting of the presidents of the high courts of major administrative regions and the five provinces and two cities of North China in October. The meeting discussed the implementation of the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and the strengthening of the people's democratic dictatorship, and reviewed and criticized the tendency of boundless leniency and its ideological causes. At the same time, the People's Courts in various places, under the direct leadership of the people's governments at the same level, successively conveyed and discussed the spirit of the central government's instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, and in connection with the past errors in handling counter-revolutionary criminals, such as light sentences, leniency, and lax supervision, carried out a more general examination from top to bottom. From the 177 inspection reports sent by various places, we can see that counter-revolutionary activities are ubiquitous, insidious, and brutal: bandits, secret agents, local bullies, and reactionary secret societies collude with each other, openly raising all kinds of anti-people banners, organizing armed riots and "guerrilla warfare" against us, killing people and revolutionary cadres, setting fires, looting, and raping; they undermine land reform and production and construction in cities and villages; they infiltrate our organs and organizations to carry out assassinations; they fabricate and spread rumors, shamelessly advocating a third world war, touting the American atomic bomb, and using some superstitious and backward ideas among the masses to intimidate them, saying: "On a certain day of a certain month, the world will be dark with rain, not a chicken or dog will be left alive, and there will be no future in production"; saying that our promulgation of the Marriage Law is to distribute women... All these rumors are nothing more than serving the imperialist war plan, nothing more than undermining the democratic facilities of the people's government, undermining the patriotic movement of the Chinese people, undermining land reform, and undermining the revolutionary enthusiasm and productive mood of the masses.

The harm that counter-revolutionary activities cause to the country and the people is truly inexhaustible. We can readily cite two examples from the inspection reports of lower-level courts: (1) The criminal records of the 218 counter-revolutionary criminals dealt with by the judicial organs of the Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province over the past year show that 3,124 revolutionary cadres and people were killed and 227 women were raped. On average, each counter-revolutionary criminal killed 14 revolutionary cadres and people and raped one woman. (2) Last April, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents set fire to the commercial district of Fuzhou City, burning down more than 700 houses, burning one person to death, and the property loss was incalculable. Recently, on February 20, counter-revolutionary secret agents lurking in Lingling County, Hunan Province, carried out arson on a large scale, burning down a street 600 meters long, destroying 512 buildings, killing and injuring four residents, leaving one-tenth of the city's population homeless, and the people's losses, calculated in monetary terms, amounted to more than 15.9 billion yuan. One of the important reasons why counter-revolutionary criminals dare to carry out such reckless arson and destruction is that we lack vigilance and fail to punish them effectively, and have not seriously followed Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program to implement resolute and severe suppression of counter-revolutionary criminals. Although the manifestation of unprincipled leniency in the work of punishing counter-revolutionary criminals by the People's Courts in various places varies in degree, it is a relatively common fact. Generally speaking, it is manifested in light sentences, slow processing, and lax supervision; those who should have been killed were not killed, and those who should have been severely punished were punished lightly. What "good background," "poor family circumstances," "youthful ignorance," "senile confusion," "considering the first offense," "willing to confess," "job-related crimes," "unsuccessful attempt," etc., have all become reasons for light sentences and exemption from punishment. There is a lack of vigilance against the insidious and cunning nature of counter-revolutionary elements, and we are deceived by their disguise and flowery words. Some even gave a one-year sentence to a bandit leader who killed several people and was hated by the masses, saying that "the crime deserves death, but he showed remorse after being arrested, so he was given leniency," and even regarded counter-revolutionary murder as his "self-defense" measure, and casually concluded the case by ordering the counter-revolutionary to compensate the victim for damages. Such erroneous judgments that lose their position and fail to distinguish right from wrong actually fuel the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements, allowing them to exploit the loopholes of "leniency" and "confession" to escape punishment. For example, some were caught three times and released three times. When they were caught the fourth time and asked why they repeatedly committed crimes without repentance, they said: "I confessed, be lenient with me." The counter-revolutionaries take our "leniency" as something to be taken advantage of, and the people are afraid that we will be unilaterally lenient towards the counter-revolutionaries, saying: "The people's government is good in everything, except that it is not good at condoning counter-revolutionaries," "Leniency towards counter-revolutionaries harms us ordinary people." This is absolutely true. The fact that counter-revolutionary criminals continue to harm the people after being released leniently has been constantly occurring in various places.

When the people's governments and People's Courts in various places seriously corrected the tendency of boundless leniency in accordance with the instructions of the central government, and adopted severe and timely suppression of the main counter-revolutionary elements and those who were incorrigible, it showed that people's hearts were encouraged and justice prevailed; a new and vigorous situation emerged in the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing bandits and eliminating local bullies, land reform, and production and construction, and the people's government had a higher prestige among the masses. A farmer in Dongshan County, Fujian Province, saw that the government arrested counter-revolutionary elements and severely punished them, and specially went to the county government to find the county head and said: "In the past, when I heard the song 'The sky in the liberated area is bright,' I always felt insincere in my heart. Now that you have arrested and severely punished the bandits and secret agents, the sky in the liberated area is really bright." In the past, the masses were afraid of retaliation from counter-revolutionary elements and did not dare to report them, and even when the government investigated the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements, they did not dare to speak. Now it is completely different. The masses have spontaneously risen up to report bandits and secret agents and participate in control work, leaving counter-revolutionary elements with nowhere to hide. And after the main counter-revolutionary elements and those who were incorrigible were severely suppressed, it accelerated their internal disintegration. The people were overjoyed, raised their eyebrows, and praised the people's government for doing a very good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, "better than a heavy rain." However, it should also be recognized that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a long-term and complex political task for the Chinese people. At present, imperialism is frantically preparing for war and expanding its aggression, and the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is under the wings of US imperialism, vainly attempting to "counterattack the mainland"; although the "bandit guerrilla warfare" and all counter-revolutionary activities they are carrying out on our mainland have begun to suffer serious blows from us, they are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people, and they will not automatically withdraw from the battlefield and lay down their butcher knives before they are completely defeated and eliminated. Therefore, the Chinese people must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities without any slackening, and strive for the complete victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and land reform, in order to further consolidate our great motherland and build a peaceful and happy life for the people. Although many places have made a good start in punishing counter-revolutionary work due to the correction of the tendency of boundless leniency, some places still show that the punishment of counter-revolutionaries is not effective, so we must make redoubled efforts to implement the Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries.

The Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries very clearly embody the policy of combining suppression with leniency, adopting the policy of severe suppression for the main counter-revolutionary elements, the incorrigible elements, and other elements with serious crimes, while for those who "voluntarily surrender to the people's government with sincere repentance; those who sincerely repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes before or after exposing or reporting; those who are coerced or deceived by counter-revolutionary elements and are not truly voluntary; those whose counter-revolutionary crimes before liberation were not serious, and who have truly repented and broken ties with counter-revolutionary organizations after liberation," they should be given appropriate leniency, mitigation, or exemption from punishment.

The Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries have given our people and cadres a legal weapon and given our judges a sentencing standard. But to make this weapon and sentencing standard grasped firmly, applied accurately, and effectively punish counter-revolutionary criminals, it first requires us to stand firm on the people's stand, clearly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves ideologically; we must have the greatest love for the people and the motherland and the greatest hatred for the enemy; at the same time, we must combine our political sense of responsibility with the work style of investigation and research and seeking truth from facts. In the past, some judges attributed the tendency of boundless leniency to the lack of a sentencing standard, which was wrong. It must be recognized that although the lack of such a sentencing standard in the past has caused some difficulties for our work of punishing counter-revolutionaries, the ideological cause of the tendency of boundless leniency is mainly a blind sense of peace and an erroneous idea of "benevolent governance," as well as the political paralysis and weakness in work that arise from it. For example, some said: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's millions of troops have already been defeated by us, and what can the remaining odds and ends do?" "Looking back at the reactionary rule in the past, it was so cruel and dark, we should have a clear contrast with it." Therefore, they demanded "leniency" towards counter-revolutionary elements and to subdue them with "benevolence." They do not understand that although the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's millions of troops have been defeated by us, if we do not knock off its odds and ends, it is tantamount to condoning the enemy to make a comeback and continue to harm our people and motherland. They do not understand that being kind to the enemy is being cruel to the people. After the people rise up to overthrow the cruel and dark reactionary rule and establish their own revolutionary rule, they must exercise dictatorship and suppression over the small number of reactionary classes who originally ruled the people. Revolution and counter-revolution are irreconcilable, and the enemy will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. This principle is very clear, and the actual Chinese revolution has fully confirmed this point. But there are still some people who pity the enemy, hoping that the enemy will automatically stop struggling. We can also find such examples in the inspection reports of lower-level courts, such as lightly sentencing incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes that the people call "a thousand cuts would not relieve their hatred" to only a few years in prison, reasoning that Taiwan would have been liberated in a few years. Some even cleverly set the maximum sentence at six years, explaining that according to the laws of social development, the Chinese revolution would have succeeded long ago in six years, and the counter-revolutionary criminals would have been reformed as well. (?!). This kind of understanding is obviously extremely wrong, violates the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on revolutionary practice, and is very harmful to the revolution. From here, we can clearly realize that the staff of state organs, especially the staff of state judicial organs, must continue to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought's views on the state and the law, and strengthen their people's viewpoint and people's stand on judicial work from revolutionary practice. Only in this way can we correctly implement the spirit of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries and carry out an effective struggle against counter-revolutionary elements; and finally completely eliminate them.

　　坚决镇压反革命巩固人民民主专政
    中央人民政府最高人民法院院长  沈钧儒
    中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，已经中央人民政府毛主席命令公布施行了。这个条例是根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条的规定制定的，它异常鲜明地体现了我们伟大的中华人民共和国国家和人民的利益。中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，经过了三十多年来流血牺牲英勇奋斗，终于战胜了国内外敌人，推翻了国民党反动派的统治，建立起人民民主专政的国家。“革命的基本问题是政权问题”，“但取得政权——仅仅是事情的开始”，这是因为巩固与建设革命政权、保护与发展人民的胜利成果，比起从反动派手里夺取政权来，需要做更多更艰巨的工作，而且被推翻了的反动阶级并不甘心于自己的死亡，他们还在作垂死的挣扎，图谋复辟。中央人民政府成立两年以来的历史事实完全说明了，一方面是各级人民政府与全国人民按照共同纲领在军事、政治、经济、文化各项工作中所走的每一步，都是为了加强人民民主政权，发展人民民主事业。而另一方面是国内外敌人继续从外部和从内部向我们人民国家进行绝望的反扑，破坏人民民主政权，破坏人民民主事业。自从美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，这种反革命活动是更加露骨更加嚣张了，如果听任美帝国主义的侵略战争得势与反革命分子继续放肆活动，人民就要遭殃，革命就要失败，因之人民欢呼抗美援朝领导的好，同时要求严厉镇压反革命是理所当然的。
    人民法院是人民民主专政武器之一，它的最根本的任务是镇压反动，保护人民，巩固国家权力。检查我们过去一个时候在惩治反革命的工作上做的不够好，有的地方可以说是做的很不好。人民责备我们“宽大无边”，人民的这种责备是唯恐自己所热爱的祖国受到反革命的危害，是唯恐自己已经赢得的革命果实和正在发奋建设的美好生活受到反革命的破坏。因之我们人民法院应正视工作中发生的缺点和错误，并努力克服这些缺点和错误，是对人民负责的态度。去年七月二十三日政务院和本院联合发布镇压反革命活动的指示后，十月间并由本院召开各大行政区分院和华北五省二市院长会议，会议讨论了贯彻镇压反革命活动与加强人民民主专政的问题，并对宽大无边的偏向及其思想原因作了检讨和批判。同时各地人民法院在同级人民政府直接领导下，先后传达和讨论了中央镇压反革命活动指示的精神，并联系过去在处理反革命罪犯中的轻刑宽纵与监管不严等错误，自上而下进行了较为普遍的检查。我们从各地送来的一七七份检查报告中看到反革命活动是那样的无孔不入与险恶残暴：土匪、特务、恶霸、会道门勾结一气，他们明目张胆地打起各式各样反人民的旗子，组织武装暴乱和我们“打游击”，杀害人民和革命干部，放火、抢劫、奸淫；他们在城市与农村破坏土地改革与生产建设；他们打入我机关团体内部进行暗害；他们制造和散布谣言，卑鄙无耻地鼓吹第三次世界大战，鼓吹美国原子炸弹，并且利用群众中有些迷信落后思想，进行恐吓，说：“某月某日天下黑雨，鸡犬不留，生产没有搞头了”；说我们公布婚姻法是要分配女人……所有这些谣言，无非是服从于帝国主义的战争计划，无非是为了破坏人民政府的民主设施，破坏中国人民的爱国运动，破坏土地改革，破坏人民群众的革命积极性和生产情绪。
    反革命活动给予国家人民的危害，真是罄竹难书，我们可以从下级法院的检查报告中随手举出两个例子：（一）湖北荆州专区司法机关一年来所处理的二一八名反革命犯的罪恶账，被杀害的革命干部和人民有三、一二四人，被奸淫的妇女有二二七人。平均每一个反革命罪犯杀害革命干部和人民十四人，奸淫妇女一人。（二）去年四月蒋匪特务放火焚烧福州市商业区，烧毁房屋七百余间，烧死一人，财产损失更无法计算。最近湖南省零陵县于二月二十日被潜伏的反革命特务分子大肆纵火，焚毁街道长达六百公尺，烧毁房屋五百十二栋，死伤居民四人，全城十分之一的人口无家可归，人民损失如折款计算约达一百五十九亿多元之巨。反革命罪犯的所以敢这样放肆的烧杀破坏，重要原因之一是我们对之缺乏警惕与惩治不力，没有认真地遵照毛主席的指示和共同纲领的规定对反革命罪犯实行坚决的严厉的镇压。各地人民法院在惩治反革命罪犯的工作中所表现的无原则宽大的偏向虽有程度不同，但却是较为普遍的事实，概括来说，就是量刑轻、处理慢、监管松；该杀的没有杀了，该严办的办轻了。什么“成份好”、“家境苦”、“年轻无知”、“年老昏聩”、“姑念初犯”、“尚肯坦白”、“职务犯罪”、“目的未遂”等等都成了轻刑免罪的理由，对反革命分子阴险狡猾的本质缺乏警惕，被他们的伪装与花言巧语所迷惑。有的对杀害几条人命，为群众切齿痛恨的匪首，也以“论罪死有余辜，但被捕后表示悔悟，而从宽处以一年徒刑”，甚至把反革命杀人看作是他的“自卫”措施，对反革命血债判以赔偿被害人损害，马虎了事。这样丧失立场、是非不明的错误判决，实际是助长了反革命分子的凶焰，使他们能够钻“宽大”“坦白”的空子逃脱罪罚；即如有的捉了三次放了三次，第四次被擒问他为什么累犯不改，还说：“我坦白哩，宽大宽大我吧。”反革命以我们“宽大”为可欺，人民就怕我们对反革命片面宽大，说：“人民政府什么都好，就是放纵反革命不好”，“宽大了反革命，害了我们老百姓”。这是千真万确的。反革命罪犯被宽纵出去后继续危害人民的事，各地曾不断发生。
    当着各地人民政府与人民法院遵照中央的指示认真纠正宽大无边的偏向，对反革命首要分子和怙恶不悛的分子采取了严厉的及时的镇压以后，就表现人心振奋，正气抬头；抗美援朝、剿匪反霸、土地改革、生产建设各项工作出现了新的蓬勃发展的局面，人民政府在群众中也有了更高的威信。福建东山县有一个农民看到政府把反革命分子逮捕起来加以严办以后，特地跑到县政府找县长说：“我以往听到唱‘解放区的天是明朗的天’，总是心里不实在，现在你们把土匪特务抓起严办，解放区的天就真是明朗的天了。”过去群众害怕反革命分子报复，不敢检举告发，甚至政府向他们调查反革命分子的罪行也不敢说，现在完全不同了，群众纷纷自动起来检举土匪特务与参加管制工作，使反革命分子无藏身之处。而反革命首要分子与怙恶不悛的分子受到严厉镇压以后，就加速了他们内部的动摇瓦解。人民欢天喜地，扬眉吐气，称赞人民政府镇压反革命工作做得很对，“比下一场透雨还好”。但是，还应该认识到，镇压反革命是中国人民长期的复杂的政治任务，目前帝国主义正在疯狂地进行战争准备，扩大侵略，蒋介石残余匪帮正在美帝国主义卵翼之下，妄想“反攻大陆”；它们在我国大陆所进行的“土匪游击战争”与一切反革命活动，虽然已开始遭到我们严重的打击，但它们是中国人民的死敌，在它们没有被彻底打败和消灭之前是不会自动退出战场放下屠刀的。因之中国人民必需毫不懈怠地坚决镇压反革命活动，争取抗美援朝与土地改革的彻底胜利，以便进一步巩固我们伟大的祖国，建设人民的和平幸福的生活。许多地方虽由于纠正宽大无边的偏向，在惩治反革命工作上有了好的开端，但有些地方还依然表现着对反革命惩治不力，因之要贯彻实施惩治反革命条例，我们还必须加倍努力。
    惩治反革命条例十分明确地体现了镇压与宽大相结合的政策，对于反革命首要分子怙恶不悛的分子及其他罪恶重大的分子采取严厉镇压的方针，而对于“自动向人民政府真诚自首悔过者；在揭发、检举前或以后真诚悔过立功赎罪者；被反革命分子胁迫、欺骗，确非自愿者；解放前反革命罪行并非重大，解放后又确已悔改并与反革命组织断绝联系者。”就给予酌情从轻，减轻或免予处刑。
    惩治反革命条例给了我们人民和干部一个法律武器，给了我们审判人员一个量刑标准。但是要使这个武器和量刑标准掌握得稳，运用得准，有力地惩治反革命罪犯，就首先要求我们站稳人民立场，在思想上明确分清敌我界限；要有对人民祖国最大的爱与对敌人最大的憎恨；同时要把我们的政治责任心与调查研究实事求是的工作作风结合起来。过去有的审判人员把宽大无边的偏向归咎于没有一个量刑标准的缘故，那是错误的。必须认识到过去没有这样一个量刑标准，对于我们惩治反革命工作虽然有着某些困难，但发生宽大无边偏向的思想原因主要是盲目的太平观念与错误的“仁政”思想，以及由此产生政治上的麻痹，工作上的软弱无力。例如有的说：“蒋介石匪帮数百万军队已经被我们打倒了，剩下的一些脚脚爪爪还成得了什么气候”。“回顾过去反动统治是那样的残暴黑暗，我们应该与它有个鲜明的对照。”于是要求对反革命分子“宽大为怀”，以“仁”服之。不了解蒋介石匪帮数百万军队虽然被我们打倒了，但如果不把它的脚脚爪爪敲掉，那就等于纵容敌人卷土重来继续祸害我们的人民祖国。不了解对敌人仁慈就是对人民残忍。人民起来推翻残暴黑暗的反动统治，建立人民自己的革命统治之后，必须对原来统治人民的少数反动阶级实行专政，实行镇压。革命与反革命誓不两立，敌人也不会自动退出历史舞台，这道理是很明白的，中国革命实际也完全证实了这一点。但依然还有一些人怜悯敌人，希望敌人会自动停止挣扎，我们从下级法院的检查报告中也能找到这样的例子，即如对罪大恶极的、人民称之为“千刀万剐不解恨”的反革命怙恶不悛的分子，也以再过几年台湾就早已解放为理由而轻轻判了几年的徒刑。有的甚至自作聪明把最高徒刑定为六年，据解释是根据社会发展的规律，再过六年中国革命就早已成功了，反革命犯也都改造好了。（？！）这种认识方法显然是极端错误的，违背了马克思列宁主义与毛泽东思想关于革命实践的真理，对革命是非常有害的。从这里我们可以明白地认识到：国家机关的工作人员，特别是国家审判机关的工作人员，必须继续努力学习马克思列宁主义与毛泽东思想的国家观、法律观，并从革命实践中去加强关于司法工作上的人民观点和人民立场。只有这样才能正确地贯彻惩治反革命条例的精神，与反革命分子进行有效的斗争；并且最后把他们彻底消灭。
