Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: According to Chongqing's *Xinhua Daily*, Pan Dakui, Chen Baoyin, Wu Mi, Li Zixiang, and other professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from Chongqing University, Southwest Normal College, Southwest Industrial Vocational School, Southwest Art College, Zhengyang College, Qiujing Business College, and Chonghua College, totaling more than 350 people, jointly signed letters to Japanese and American professors, calling for opposition to the U.S.'s rearming of Japan and a separate peace treaty with Japan.

The open letter from Chongqing university professors to Japanese professors stated: "We Chinese people suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialists. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, we sacrificed more than ten million compatriots and lost property worth five hundred billion U.S. dollars. The Japanese warlords performed the so-called 'Three Alls Policy' of 'kill all, loot all, burn all' in our country. We can never forget this tragic blood debt. We hate Japanese imperialists; they are our mortal enemies. Now, American imperialists are supporting the resurgence of Japanese militarism, revitalizing the Japanese fascist aggressive forces. This is what our 475 million people resolutely oppose."

The letter stated: "Although Japanese imperialism is our mortal enemy, the Japanese people are our friends. American imperialists rearming Japan not only destroys Asian peace and threatens China's security, but also endangers the Japanese people. We should unite to oppose the U.S.'s separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearming of Japan, and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan. We know that only with the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan can the U.S. imperialists' plot to occupy Japan for a long time and colonize it be shattered; a democratic, independent, peaceful, and happy Japan can be realized. Righteous and patriotic Japanese professors, take action! Victory belongs to the Japanese people and the Asian people."

The professors' open letter to American professors stated:

"At a time when world peace is facing a serious threat, we deeply hope that far-sighted teachers from American universities can further organize themselves and resolutely oppose the U.S. ruling class's plot for a separate peace treaty with Japan."

The letter stated: "In order to prevent the fascist bandits in America from having more opportunities to continue committing crimes against the people in Asia, the world, and their own country, we believe that you will further stand with the people of the world and actively launch a movement to defend world peace in your own country. We hope to use the power of the broad masses of the American people to urge your government to break the shackles of Wall Street, withdraw its troops from the aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and abandon the conspiracy of rearming Japan and making a separate peace treaty with Japan, so that your country can live in peace with the people of the whole world and jointly seek the happiness and freedom of mankind."

　　重庆高等学校教师三百五十余人函促日本
    及美国教授共同反对武装日本
    【新华社二十九日讯】据重庆《新华日报》载：重庆大学、西南师范学院、西南工业专科学校、西南艺术学院、正阳学院、求精商学院及重华学院等高等学校教授、讲师与助教潘大逵、陈豹隐、吴宓、李紫翔等三百五十余人联合签名致书日本及美国教授，呼吁反对美国重新武装日本与单独对日媾和。
    重庆各高等学校教授致日本教授的公开信称：我中国人民遭受日本帝国主义者的侵略，在八年抗日战争中，我们牺牲了千万以上的同胞，损失了价值五百亿美元的财产。日本军阀在我国表演杀光、抢光、烧光的所谓“三光政策”。这惨痛的血债，我们永远不能忘记。我们仇恨日本帝国主义者，它是我们的死敌。现在美帝国主义者扶植日本军国主义再起，使日本法西斯侵略势力重振，这是我们四亿七千五百万人民坚决反对的。
    该信称：日本帝国主义虽是我们的死敌，而日本人民却是我们的朋友。美帝国主义者重新武装日本，不特破坏亚洲和平，威胁中国安全，而且也是危害日本人民的。我们应该联合起来，反对美国单独对日媾和及重新武装日本而要求缔结全面的公正的对日和约。我们知道，只有苏联与中华人民共和国参加对日和约的缔结，美帝国主义长期占领日本，使日本殖民地化的阴谋才会被粉碎；民主的、独立的、和平的、幸福的日本才能实现。正义的爱国的日本教授们行动起来，胜利是属于日本人民和亚洲人民的。
    教授们致美国教授的公开信称：
    在这世界和平面临着严重威胁的时候，我们深深盼望有远见的美国各大学的教师们能够进一步组织起来，坚决反对美国统治阶级单独对日媾和的阴谋。
    该信称：为了使美国的法西斯匪徒们在亚洲、世界，以及自己的国内没有更多的机会来继续制造敌对人民的罪行，我们相信你们一定会进一步与世界人民站在一边，在自己的国内积极展开保卫世界和平运动。我们希望用广大的美国人民的力量促使你们的政府扭断华尔街的束缚，撤退侵略朝鲜和台湾的军队，放弃重新武装日本与单独对日媾和的阴谋，使你们的国家能与全世界的人民和平相处，共谋人类的幸福和自由。
