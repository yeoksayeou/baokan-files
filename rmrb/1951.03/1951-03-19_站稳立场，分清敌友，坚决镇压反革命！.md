Firmly Stand Our Ground, Distinguish Between Friend and Foe, Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries!
       Ning Wu
    Currently, the entire nation is continuing to unfold the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries on the foundation of victory. The Central People's Government passed and promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" on February 20th of this year. This regulation was formulated in accordance with Article 7 of the Common Program to punish counter-revolutionary criminals, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. The promulgation and implementation of this regulation will greatly consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship.

    However, among us, there are still some people who, due to insufficient understanding or being blinded by victory, have forgotten that the enemies who have fallen before us are still making a last-ditch struggle and have not been completely eliminated. They believe that since the people have already won, there is no need to fear the rebellion of counter-revolutionary elements, and we should be benevolent and tolerant, and there is no need for suppression. Such a statement, if not naive and ignorant, is a serious case of ideological numbness.

    First of all, it must be recognized that the victory of the Chinese revolution did not come easily. Our revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers underwent long and arduous struggles with ferocious enemies at home and abroad to achieve today's great victory. Therefore, we must protect our fruits of victory with great love and a hundredfold courage.

    This great fruit of victory is most concretely manifested in the fact that the Chinese people have their own motherland and their own most powerful weapon, namely the people's democratic dictatorship. This people's democratic dictatorship, in just over a year, has organized the power of the people and has achieved rapid and victorious development on the political, military, economic, and cultural fronts. Facts have proven that our weapon—the people's democratic dictatorship—is the newest, most beautiful, and strongest weapon. With such a weapon, we have the power to protect the interests of the people and sufficient power to overwhelm all enemies of the revolution!

    However, the imperialist bloc headed by U.S. imperialism and the remnant forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are not reconciled to failure and death. They are still attempting to use all possible means to carry out various sabotage activities against our great motherland and people. Especially after U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, believing that the time had come, arrogantly carried out various naked sabotage activities. Although our People's Liberation Army and People's Public Security Forces have waged resolute struggles against bandits, secret agents, and other counter-revolutionary elements and achieved great victories, these counter-revolutionary activities are all instigated behind the scenes by U.S. imperialists. As long as the imperialists who oppose the Chinese people continue to exist, our domestic counter-revolutionary activities will continue to occur. Therefore, if one believes that victory has already been achieved, and that "benevolent governance" can be applied to the enemy, and that there is no need for suppression, then that is treating the great people's revolutionary cause as a child's play, and it is the greatest unkindness to the people!

    Among us, there are also some people who confuse the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front with the resolute elimination of counter-revolutionary remnants in the struggle against the enemy. As Comrade Peng Zhen said: "They do not understand that the more thoroughly the counter-revolutionary remnants are eliminated, the fewer factors there will be to sow discord and undermine the united front, and therefore the united front will be more consolidated. At the same time, the more consolidated and widespread the united front, the more isolated the enemy will be, and the easier it will be to eliminate the counter-revolutionary remnants." If we do not understand it in this way, but confuse the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and even mistakenly believe that the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries will affect the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front, this will cause great errors, and it will be impossible to distinguish who is the enemy and who is the friend, and we will be exploited by counter-revolutionary elements, and disguised counter-revolutionary elements will infiltrate our revolutionary ranks to carry out sabotage activities. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant. First of all, we must clearly understand in our minds that the people's democratic dictatorship includes democracy for the people and dictatorship over the reactionaries. The democracy for the people needs to be continuously expanded, and the dictatorship over the reactionaries needs to be continuously strengthened. If we only pay attention to the aspect of people's democracy and ignore the aspect of dictatorship over the reactionaries, and do not combine these two aspects, we will, as in the past, have a tendency towards boundless leniency.

    For those people with confused thoughts and unclear understanding, we must strengthen political and ideological education to raise their level of political awareness. For those who have already recognized why it is necessary to suppress counter-revolutionaries, they should, in practice, first stand firm, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, correctly grasp the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service," unite the people of the whole country, and strive to assist the government in fighting to the end to complete this important task!

### 站稳立场，分清敌友，坚决镇压反革命！

　　站稳立场，分清敌友，坚决镇压反革命！
       宁武
    现在全国人民正在胜利的基础上继续展开抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动。中央人民政府在今年二月二十日通过并公布了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”。这个条例是根据共同纲领第七条的规定，为惩治反革命罪犯，镇压反革命活动，巩固人民民主专政而制定的。这个条例的公布实施，将使我国人民民主专政大大地巩固起来。
    但是在我们中间还有一些人，由于认识不足或是由于胜利冲昏了头脑，忘记了倒在我们面前的敌人还在作垂死的挣扎，还没有彻底消灭。他们认为人民既已经胜利了，不怕反革命分子造反，就应该仁慈宽大，用不着镇压了。这样的说法，如果不是幼稚无知，就是思想上犯了严重的麻木症。
    首先必须认识：中国革命的胜利不是容易得来的，我们革命先烈革命军人跟国内外凶恶的敌人进行了长期的艰苦的斗争，才取得了今天伟大的胜利。因此，我们必须以高度热爱与百倍勇气来保卫我们的胜利果实。
    这个伟大的胜利果实，最具体表现出来的，就是我们中国人民有了自己的祖国，有了自己最有力的武器，即人民民主专政。这个人民民主专政。仅仅一年多时间，已经把人民的力量组织起来了，并且在政治、军事、经济、文化各个战线上，有了迅速的胜利发展。事实已经证明了我们的武器——人民民主专政，是最新式、最美好、和最坚强的武器。我们有了这样的武器，就有力量来保卫人民利益，并有足够的力量来压倒一切革命的敌人！
    但是，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团和蒋匪帮的残余势力，是不甘心于失败和死亡的，他们还企图利用一切的可能，对我们伟大的祖国与人民进行各种的破坏活动。特别是在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，一切暗藏的反革命分子，认为时机已到，狂妄地进行了各种露骨的破坏活动。虽然经我人民解放军和人民公安部队对土匪、特务等反革命分子作了坚决的斗争，取得了很大的胜利，但这些反革命活动都是有美帝国主义者在背后策动的，只要反对中国人民的帝国主义者继续存在一天，我们国内的反革命活动也就会继续发生。因此，如果认为已经取得了胜利，就可以对敌人施“仁政”，就可以不用镇压，那就是把伟大的人民革命事业当儿戏，就是对人民的最大的不仁！
    在我们中间，也还有一些人，把人民民主统一战线的巩固与扩大和对敌人斗争中坚决肃清反革命残余的问题相混淆了。正如彭真同志所说的：“他们不了解，反革命残余肃清得越彻底，挑拨离间，破坏统一战线的因素就越少，因而统一战线就越加巩固。同时统一战线越巩固，越广泛，敌人就越孤立，反革命残余就越容易被肃清”。如果不这样去了解它，而把巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线和镇压反革命的问题相混淆起来，甚至误认为严厉镇压反革命会影响人民民主统一战线的巩固与扩大，这就会造成极大的错误，就会分不清谁是敌人，谁是朋友，就会被反革命分子所利用，而伪装的反革命分子就会混进我们革命的队伍里来进行破坏活动。因此，我们必须高度地警惕，首先要在思想上明确人民民主专政是包括对人民的民主和对反动派的专政，对人民的民主需要继续扩大，对反动派的专政则需要继续加强。如果只注意了人民民主的一方面，忽略了对反动派的专政一方面，而不把这二方面结合起来看，就会和过去一样，发生宽大无边的偏向。
    对于这些思想混乱认识不清的人，我们必须加强进行政治思想教育，提高他们的政治觉悟程度。对于已经认识了为什么必须镇压反革命的人，就应该要他们在实践中，首先做到站稳立场，分清敌我，正确掌握“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，团结全国人民，努力协助政府，为完成这一重要任务而奋斗到底！（附图片）
