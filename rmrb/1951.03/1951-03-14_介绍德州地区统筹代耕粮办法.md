To the Editor:

We have read the instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government regarding strengthening substitute tilling work, published in the People's Daily on January 27th. We are now presenting our experiences in solving this problem in the Dezhou area of Shandong for your reference.

In the Dezhou area of Shandong, we had some districts and villages that initially implemented substitute tilling work during the Anti-Japanese War. It started with mutual assistance tilling, where mutual aid teams (groups) helped with tilling (i.e., the method of "large and small labor allocation"). Later, it developed into fixed substitute tilling (i.e., fixed groups for fixed households). Although the government worked hard to promote this substitute tilling method, the results were always limited, and the production and lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers (hereinafter referred to as "martyrs' and soldiers' families") were still not guaranteed. This was due to insufficient mobilization and education work on our part, and the burden was not reasonable enough. Taking a village as an example, the labor burden between households was unbalanced; taking a township as an example, the burden varied greatly between villages. As a result, some people treated substitute tilling work with a passive attitude.

We believe that to reform the substitute tilling system, we must focus on production and measure the results. Based on our experience, in areas where the number of martyrs' and soldiers' families is generally small and not concentrated (the situation in the Dezhou area is like this), the method of collecting substitute tilling grain based on the labor of the substitute tilling masses is good. In 1950, the Dezhou area, with reference to the substitute tilling regulations in North China, tried the method of collecting substitute tilling grain based on the village as a unit (converting all the mu that should be substitute tilled in the whole village into substitute tilling grain, which is borne equally by the labor force that should bear the substitute tilling. Generally, one mu of land requires one labor unit, and each labor unit pays six jin of grain, which is paid in spring, summer, and autumn). As a result, the villages that collected and handed over the substitute tilling grain to the substitute tilled households on time achieved remarkable results in substitute tilling. The output of general substitute tilled land was equal to the production volume of the masses' own tilled land; the output of individual substitute tilled land even exceeded the output of the masses' own tilled land. Villages that could not collect substitute tilling grain on time later turned into small labor allocation, and the results were very bad. Generally, they hoed one to two times less, so the output of substitute tilled land was lower than the output of the masses' own tilled land.

However, the above method has the problem of an unbalanced burden between villages. Villages with more martyrs' and soldiers' families have a heavy burden; conversely, the burden is very light. Therefore, the village that actively collects substitute tilling grain and works hard at substitute tilling suffers. Last winter, based on this experience, in order to seek a more reasonable burden, we changed to using the township as a unit,统筹(tǒngchóu – coordinate) substitute tilling grain according to labor and animal power, and handed the substitute tilling grain directly to the martyrs' and soldiers' families for their own management; only for some who are lazy and have no management ability, we continued to use the old substitute tilling method (i.e., handing the substitute tilling grain to the substitute tilling household). This new method has been tried in several townships in our Dezhou Special District and has now been accepted by all parties (martyrs' and soldiers' families, the masses, village cadres). Shuangmiao Township, Yuanzheng District, Linyi County, implemented the method of统筹(tǒngchóu – coordinate) substitute tilling grain in the whole township, with an average of more than twenty-nine jin of rice borne by each full labor force, and Twelve Mile Village, De County, with an average of more than twenty-two jin of rice borne by each full labor force. The results of substitute tilling are much better than labor allocation and fixed substitute tilling (it is impossible to regulate substitute tilling grain only by using labor). A soldier's mother said: "With this method, I don't have to look for the village cadre every day. If I want to substitute till, I will; if I don't want to substitute till, I will hire a short-term worker; if not, I will work harder myself and save some food to improve my life." Another soldier's family member said, "It is guaranteed to give the substitute tilling grain to us. We have the pancake in our hands. If they don't substitute till well for us, we won't use them." An old farmer said: "Taking out some grain is also worry-free, which makes it easier to plan your own work." Some also said: "It is more reasonable to统筹(tǒngchóu – coordinate) substitute tilling grain with the township as a unit, otherwise, it is not good for the village that works actively to suffer."

We believe that this method has four advantages: (1) It guarantees the production of martyrs' and soldiers' families and encourages martyrs' and soldiers' families to work hard themselves. (2) Although the masses bear a part of the grain, it is not heavy compared to the labor wasted by using labor allocation for substitute tilling. (3) The substitute tilling households get grain as remuneration for substitute tilling, so they work actively. (4) The burden is more reasonable.

### 介绍德州地区统筹代耕粮办法

    介绍德州地区统筹代耕粮办法编辑同志：
    我们看到了一月二十七日人民日报发表的中央人民政府内务部关于加强代耕工作的指示。现在我们把山东德州地区解决这个问题的经验提出来供大家参考。
    山东德州地区在抗日战争时期，就曾经有一部分区村初步实行代耕工作。开始是互助帮耕，由互助队（组）助耕（即大小拨工的方式），后来发展到固定代耕（即是固定组固定户）。这种代耕办法，虽经政府努力倡导，但收效总是有限，革命烈士家属和革命军人家属（以下简称烈、军属）的生产和生活仍然没有保证。这是由于我们动员教育工作不够，而且负担上不够合理所致。以一个村说，户与户之间的劳力负担不平衡；以一个乡说，村与村之间的负担轻重悬殊，因之某些群众就抱着消极态度来对待代耕工作。
    我们认为：要改革代耕制度，必须从生产上着眼，在效果上衡量。根据我们的经验，在一般烈、军属人数不多且不集中的地区（德州地区情况就是这样），实行按代耕群众劳力收集代耕粮的办法是好的。德州地区在一九五○年参考华北地区的代耕规定，试行以村为单位收集代耕粮的办法（将全村应代耕亩数全部折成代耕粮，由应负担代耕的劳力平均负担。一般的一亩地一个工，每工六斤粮，分春夏秋三季交纳），结果，凡是按期将代耕粮收集起来交给代耕者的村，代耕成绩就显著。一般的代耕地的产量和群众自耕地的生产量相等；个别的代耕地还超过群众自耕地的产量。凡不能按时收集代耕粮的村，随后又变成小拨工，成绩很坏，普遍的少锄一遍到两遍，因之代耕地的产量低于群众自耕地的产量。
    但是，上述办法中却存在着村与村之间的负担不平衡的问题。烈、军属多的村，负担重；反之，负担就很轻。因此那村积极收集代耕粮，努力代耕，那个村就吃了亏。在去年冬季，我们根据这个经验，为了求得负担的较为合理，即改以乡为单位，按劳力畜力，统筹代耕粮，并将代耕粮直接交给烈、军属，由他们自己管理；只是对一些好吃懒做以及无经营能力的，仍继续采用旧的代耕办法（即将代耕粮交于代耕户）。这种新的办法，已在我们德州专区的几个乡试行过了，现在已为各方面（烈、军属，群众，村干）所接受。临邑县袁郑区双庙乡实行全乡统筹代耕粮的办法，平均每个整劳动力负担二十九斤多米，德县十二里庄平均每个整劳动力负担二十二斤多米，代耕的成绩，比拨工固定代耕（光用劳力调剂不出代耕粮）强的多。一个军属大娘说：“这个办法我可不要每天光找村干部了，愿意代耕我就代耕；不愿代耕，我叫短工；再不，我自己多干点，省下粮食改善生活也好。”另一个军属说：“把代耕粮交给咱有把握，烧饼在咱手里，不给咱好好的代耕，咱就不用他。”一个老农民说：“拿出点粮食来倒也省心，好多计划自己的活。”也有的说：“以乡为单位统筹代耕粮，到是比较合理，要不然那个村工作积极，那个村吃亏也不好。”
    我们认为这个办法的好处有四点：（一）对烈、军属的生产有保证，并能鼓励烈、军属自己努力劳动。（二）群众虽然负担一部分粮食，但比起用拨工代耕所浪费的劳力来并不重。（三）代耕户得到粮食，作为代耕的报酬，干起活来也就积极。（四）负担较为合理。
