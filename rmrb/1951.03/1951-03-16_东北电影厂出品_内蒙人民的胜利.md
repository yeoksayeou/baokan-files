The Chinese People's Liberation War has entered the counter-offensive stage. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, people from all walks of life in Inner Mongolia established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in order to continue its criminal rule over the people of Inner Mongolia, carried out conspiracies under the instigation of U.S. imperialism.

A bandit spy named Yang disguised himself and infiltrated a banner (county) on the edge of Inner Mongolia, and wooed Chuanyintu, the Tuslagchi (Associate) under the Wang (Prince). Chuanyintu was a Mongolian traitor with ulterior motives, hoping to rely on the power of the Kuomintang to usurp the throne; in the banner, he used harsh labor to oppress the poor herdsmen.

The herdsman Dun Debu and his younger brother herded horses for the Wang in the wind and rain every day, leaving their nearly blind mother at home unable to care for her. His marriage to the neighboring girl, Wuyun Bilege, was also difficult to fulfill because he could not get the Wang’s permission.

On this day, Wuyun Bilege's elder brother, Menghe Bateer, who had been away from home for four or five years, suddenly returned from another banner. He returned to his hometown with Comrade Su He of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government to establish a democratic government.

Dun Debu regarded Su He as a Han Chinese, and therefore suspected his friend Menghe Bateer of betraying his nation and was very angry.

In Wuyun Bilege's yurt, Su He met Jama Lama, a poor lama who also told of his family's hardships.

The Wang was receiving the bandit spy Yang in the Wangfu (Prince's Mansion) and heard that the People's Government had sent people to this banner. Yang urged the Wang to arrest the visitors and openly oppose the Communist Party, but the Wang hesitated. Jiahela Geqi (an official of the Wangfu) secretly advised the Wang not to lightly believe the words of the bandit spy and cause trouble.

The Wang met with Su He, and Su He handed the government's letter and a personal letter from Bayan Wang, who had already joined the People's Government, to the Wang, explaining to him the government's expectations and policies. At this time, there was a clamor outside the door. It turned out that Menghe Bateer's father was injured after falling from the mountain while repairing the Wangfu for the Wang. The Wang ordered the work of repairing the Wangfu to be stopped.

The released slaves returned home, spreading the word that the People's Government had sent people. The bandit spy and Chuanyintu, however, sent people in the name of the Wang to spread rumors, slandering the Communist Party as spies sent by the Han Chinese.

Dun Debu ran home in the rain, wanting to hear what Su He and the others were preaching, but the storm blew off the top of his yurt. He hurried home and saw Su He rescuing his mother. Moved, he also heard Menghe Bateer explain the Communist Party's ethnic policy to him, and his doubts were slightly relieved.

In order to hide, the bandit spy disguised himself as a lama from another banner and lurked in the temple. At the same time, he asked Chuanyintu to instigate the Wang to collude with the bandit army, but the Wang refused. Chuanyintu flicked his sleeves and left. Jiahela Geqi advised the Wang to arrest the bandit spy and hand him over to Su He, but the Wang was afraid of causing trouble.

At the Aobao meeting, Su He met the disguised bandit spy and moved him with his words, but the Wang quickly interrupted with other words.

Dun Debu was ordered to go to the bandit area with Chuanyintu to make contact, but he was humiliated in every possible way by the bandit army and personally witnessed Chuanyintu colluding with the bandit gang. Only then did he realize who was really betraying his nation.

Dun Debu returned from the bandit army's station and ran into Yang, who was forcibly being rude to Wuyun Bilege. He was extremely angry, but when he saw the bandit spy and the Mongolian traitor whispering to each other, he regretted even more that he had been deceived.

The Mongolian traitor's conspiracy was reported to Su He by the masses. Su He sent Menghe Bateer to send a letter to his superiors, requesting reinforcements from the troops. However, he was intercepted by the Mongolian traitor's men halfway and the letter was searched.

Based on the letter, the Mongolian traitor suspected that Dun Debu had leaked the news and interrogated him severely. Dun Debu tried his best to defend himself. In order to make Dun Debu prove that he had no ulterior motives, the Mongolian traitor ordered him to kill Su He.

Dun Debu went to see Su He with a knife, painfully recounting Menghe Bateer's tragic death and the Mongolian traitor's conspiracy, and regretting that he should not have listened to the instigation of treacherous people and doubted Su He in the past. Su He comforted Dun Debu even more and decided to go back to report to his superiors himself. Dun Debu volunteered to go with him.

The bandit army invaded the grassland, and the herdsmen were cruelly ravaged. Menghe Bateer's father was dragged to death by the bandit spy using horses. At this time, our Mongolian and Han allied forces arrived on the grassland, and Su He and Dun Debu also returned together. They defeated the bandit army and captured the bandit spy and the Mongolian traitor alive. At this time, the Wang also realized his past confusion.

Dun Debu joined the ranks of the People's Liberation Army's Mongolian and Han allied forces and marched towards a bright future for the liberation of all of China. The eleventh film of the New Film Exhibition Month will be released on March 18th.

  匪特杨某化装潜入了内蒙边缘的某旗，拉拢王爷手下的吐斯拉格其（协理）传音图。吐斯拉格其是一个心怀叵测的蒙奸，希图依仗国民党的势力篡夺王位；在旗里，却用苛虐的劳役压榨着穷苦的牧民。
  牧民顿得布和他弟弟每天在风雨里给王爷牧马，丢下快瞎眼的母亲在家不能侍奉，他和邻家姑娘乌云碧勒格的婚事，也因为得不到王公的恩准而难遂私愿。
  这一天，离家四五年的乌云碧勒格的哥哥孟赫巴特尔从外旗突然回来了，他是同着内蒙古自治区人民政府的苏合同志一齐回到自己的家乡建立民主政权来的。
  顿得布把苏合当成了汉人，因之对于自己的朋友孟赫巴特尔也怀疑他出卖了自己的民族，十分愤恼。
  苏合在乌云碧勒格的蒙古包中认识了加马喇嘛，这个穷喇嘛也诉说自己家境的困苦。
  王爷正在王府里接待着匪特杨某，听说人民政府派人来到了本旗。杨某力促王爷逮捕来人，公开反共，王爷犹疑未决。贾赫拉格其（王府官员）暗劝王爷不要轻信匪特的话，惹下祸事。
  王爷和苏合相见，苏合把政府函件，和已经参加了人民政府工作的巴彦王爷的亲笔信递交王爷，当面说明了政府对他的期望和政策。这时，门外人声喧哗，原来是孟赫巴特尔的父亲因为给王爷修王府，从山上摔下负了伤。王爷下令把修王府的工停下来。
  被释放的奴隶回到家中，纷相传告人民政府派人来了。匪特和吐斯拉格其却假王爷名义派人造谣，污蔑共产党是汉人派来的奸细。

  敖包会上，苏合遇见了伪装的匪特，用话打动，王爷连忙用话岔开。
  顿得布被命随吐斯拉格其去匪区联络，却被匪军百般凌辱，并亲见吐斯拉格其和匪帮勾结，他心理才醒悟过来出卖自己民族的真正是谁。
  顿得布从匪军驻地回来，撞见杨某正对乌云碧勒格强施无礼，他气愤已极，却见匪特与蒙奸窃窃耳语，顿心中更懊悔自己受骗。
  蒙奸的阴谋经群众报告苏合，苏合派孟赫巴特尔给上级送信，调部队来应援；行经半途，却被蒙奸派人截击，并搜去信件。
  蒙奸根据信件，疑是顿得布泄露消息，严加诘问，顿极力辩白，为了使顿得布证明自己并无二心，蒙奸令他去杀苏合。
  顿得布持刀往见苏合，痛述孟赫巴特尔的惨死，和蒙奸的阴谋，悔恨自己过去不该听信奸人挑拨，怀疑苏合。苏合对顿得布加倍安慰，决心自己回去向上级报告，顿得布自愿随去。
