　　Discussion on Improving District-Level Leadership Methods and Strengthening Party Leadership

　　(I)
　　Zhao Ji

　　The Communist Party Committee of Huolu County, Hebei Province, has adopted the following specific measures to improve district-level leadership methods, which are now presented for discussion. First, the Huolu County Party Committee decided that after a central task arrives, it should be studied in terms of principles and policies at the County Party Committee meeting, and then supervise the relevant departments to implement it. Other departments should cooperate with each other. As a result, the County Party Committee has been freed from unnecessary administrative work and has time to strengthen its leadership over the district committees. The districts have also changed accordingly. The first, second, and fourth districts have changed faster and better. Now, the district committees in these districts can take the time to understand the situation in the entire district, study instructions from higher levels, and make work arrangements, and have begun to overcome the past chaotic phenomena in their work; therefore, they have time to rectify village branches and establish branch education and training stations. On the other hand, the work of government and mass organizations has also become more proactive. It has been proven in practice that after departmental work is established, it will not only not weaken the central work, but will also better promote it. For example, the first district held a meeting of key village-level cadres in the entire district to deploy the summer grain requisition as the central task. After the deployment, each department discussed the implementation methods separately, which better ensured the completion of the central task. Each village also held meetings by system and area to discuss how to implement the instructions and tasks from higher levels. After district-level cadres went to the countryside, they also found village-level cadres in their respective departments to check and promote work. In this way, the work can proceed smoothly and the tasks can be completed on time. Moreover, village cadres also have time to do a good job in their own production. Wang Mingchen, the secretary of the Xiren Village branch in the first district, only harvested three shi of grain last year, but this year he harvested three shi more because he put in more effort. The branch also has time to educate party members and improve their ideological and political level.

　　Huolu County has also gained the following experiences in improving district-level leadership methods: (1) In-depth ideological education should be conducted in advance. At the beginning, after receiving instructions from higher levels on this issue, some districts had the following deviations. When the secretary of the first district party committee learned that higher authorities wanted to see how district-level leadership methods were improved, he said: "The Party and government are separated, and no one should interfere with anyone!" After saying that, he packed his bedding and went to the countryside. The remaining cadres looked at each other, not knowing where to go. A spontaneous trend of canceling leadership and each going their own way also occurred among village-level cadres. This shows that some cadres still have insufficient understanding of the issue of improving district-level leadership methods, which has led to some illusions; on the other hand, some people's habits of monopolizing and taking over everything are indeed very deep, and there is great ideological resistance when trying to change this habit now. These must be transformed through in-depth ideological education.

　　(2) Improving district-level leadership methods must be carried out from top to bottom. In the past, higher-level party committees also had the phenomenon of monopolizing the work of various departments. Therefore, to improve district-level leadership methods, this work must be carried out from top to bottom, otherwise it will be impossible to improve district-level leadership.

　　(3) Establish and strengthen departmental work. In the past, departmental work was generally neglected, so the organizational structures and cadre allocation of many departments were unsound. The Party Committee should specifically help them gradually improve.

　　(II)
　　Lu Gan

　　Now, I would like to put forward the situation of district-level leadership in various areas of Shandong and my personal views on improving district-level leadership methods for everyone to discuss:

　　In some areas of Shandong, during the Anti-Japanese War, townships (each with a dozen villages) were established below the district level, and although they were later abolished, some areas re-established townships between 1948 and 1949. Thus, there are two different situations in district-level leadership: one is in areas where townships are not established, district-level leadership mostly adopts the method of all-encompassing leadership, mainly manifested in: the district often convenes meetings of village cadres (including cadres from various departments) in the entire district to convey and deploy work, and after returning to the village, work is also carried out in an all-encompassing manner. At the same time, members of the district committee separately lead a group of cadres, stay in key villages to carry out work, divide their forces to guard their posts, and each goes their own way. The formation of this leadership method is first and foremost inseparable from the leadership of the prefectural and county party committees. Some prefectural and county party committees also like to hold all-encompassing meetings. Sometimes, when the prefectural committee deploys work, it convenes a large meeting of cadres from various systems at the district level, sometimes numbering hundreds of people, and deploys the work of various departments in the district all at once. At that time, it was still believed that this was to achieve specific leadership. In reality, it is monopolizing and taking over everything. Other departments are equivalent to being set up in name only and rarely play a role. Secondly, the scope of the district is too large, and there are too few cadres in each department to lead, so naturally, an all-encompassing leadership method is adopted. Finally, the main district-level cadres have insufficient understanding of general cadres and insufficient training. They always believe that these cadres are weak and that they must do everything themselves, resulting in a serious work style of substitution and monopolization.

　　However, districts that have established townships have a different phenomenon. For example, one district in Wulian County has sixty or seventy villages. In addition to the main cadres in the district, other cadres are scattered in the townships to serve as township branch secretaries, township heads, or township peasant association chairmen. In this way, the district-level leadership does not need to adopt an all-encompassing leadership method, but each department cadre separately conveys and deploys work through the joint meetings of township branch secretaries, joint meetings of township heads, and joint meetings of township peasant association chairmen. At these meetings, organize typical reports and conduct discussions and studies on specific issues. In addition, some districts use market days to convene informal meetings of township cadres. After returning to the township, township cadres separately convene meetings of various departments in the township to discuss work. On the one hand, the district sends a certain number of cadres to various villages to inspect and help with work; on the other hand, it uses a certain number of cadres to concentrate on working in one or two key villages in order to learn from experience and promote the entire district. This leadership method is good. Its advantages are as follows: (1) It gives play to the collective leadership role of the district and township levels and the leadership role of each department; (2) The leadership promptly deploys work, organizes reports, and introduces experiences, which is conducive to cultivating, educating, and improving cadres' ability to work independently.

　　Therefore, regarding the improvement of district-level leadership methods, in addition to agreeing with Comrade Hou Yong's opinions (see "Transforming the All-Encompassing Leadership Methods at the District Level" in this newspaper on December 14), I would like to add a few points: (1) The scope of the district should be divided smaller, or establish township organizations, strengthen the leadership of the township and the leadership role of each system. After the establishment of the township, it is also easier to cultivate and promote cadres. It is indeed somewhat difficult for village cadres to directly serve as district cadres; however, the work scope of township cadres is smaller, and newly promoted cadres can easily learn and master it; and because they are only partially detached from production, they are spared from suddenly leaving their families, which can cause difficulties for the family. (2) District-level should adopt more centralized leadership, the method of general appeals and individual guidance, and promote work through various departments in the district and township. After the district issues a call, on the one hand, it can create typical examples in key villages to promote the entire district, and on the other hand, it can draw out a certain number of cadres to go to various places to inspect work in order to change the leadership method of work teams dividing their forces to guard their posts.

　　(III)
　　Wei Shiying

　　The issue of improving district-level leadership methods includes these three aspects: improving the leadership of the district committee itself, the district committee's leadership over villages, village-level leadership, and other issues.

　　First, it should be admitted that the party committee system in some districts is unsound and has not shouldered the task of leading the work of the entire district. In many districts, if the district committee secretary is strong, the district committee secretary monopolizes all the work; if the district head is strong, the district head monopolizes all the work. Moreover, the district committee secretary and the district head believe that "it is not possible not to monopolize," and other cadres also believe that "the district committee secretary and the district head should manage, there are thousands of mouths in the family, and one person is in charge." Some people even say: "If you monopolize, I will do less!" After going down, the members of the district committee only work in one key village and do not understand the situation in the entire district; at the district committee meeting, they only "report work and receive tasks." However, on the other hand, there is also a phenomenon of laissez-faire. For example, a laissez-faire attitude is adopted towards the armed forces and public security bureaus, and some problems have also occurred.

　　Secondly, after the district cadres go to the village, they do not carry out work through the cadres of various departments, but find whoever is active. Village cadres reflect: "Whipping the fast ox!" In this way, some of the more active village cadres are particularly busy. In addition, some district cadres not only monopolize the work of village cadres after going to key villages, but also monopolize the work of the district, forming a one-level leadership.

　　Some village-level cadres are particularly busy, which leads to a commanding style of work. For example, although many people in Jixian County raise pigs, they do not have the habit of enclosing pigs. Therefore, the county called on the masses to "enclose pigs to accumulate fertilizer," and the district decided to "enclose pigs in all cases, persuade and mobilize," and in the village it became "enclose pigs in all cases, and those who do not enclose will be fined." In addition, each system is unsound, and village cadres hold too many concurrent posts, and some branch secretaries hold four posts concurrently.

　　From the above situation, to solve the district-level leadership problem: first, it is necessary to strengthen the party committee system, implement a collective leadership and division of labor leadership system, and give full play to the organizational strength of each system, and absorb labor heroes and models to participate in leadership work. In this way, the connection with the broad masses can be strengthened, the understanding of the work situation and the ideological situation of the masses can be strengthened, work can be easily deployed, and the shortage of cadres can be remedied. Secondly, establish the necessary working system. At present, an archive system should be established first to store the basic situation of the entire district in the archive in order to overcome the past phenomenon of not understanding the situation and work being passive. Third, the improvement of leadership methods should be carried out from top to bottom at the same time. On the one hand, the upper-level departments should deploy and inspect the work of the lower-level departments, and on the other hand, they should help the lower-level departments complete their own systematic work and give play to their own roles in a planned way. Fourth, improve the village-level organizational structure and cultivate the working ability of village cadres so that they can become a one-level leadership and carry out work independently. At the same time, pay attention to reducing the concurrent posts of village cadres so that village cadres have time to participate in production and lead production. However, the district-level leadership should strengthen the inspection of the work of village cadres. Finally, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, it is necessary to strengthen the political study of district-level cadres so that they can consciously get rid of administrative work and pay attention to political leadership.

### 改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导问题的讨论

　　改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导问题的讨论
    （一）
    赵记
    河北获鹿县在改善区级领导方法中采用了这样一些具体办法，现在提出来供大家讨论。首先中共获鹿县委决定：一个中心工作任务到来后，在县委会上作一次方针政策上的研究，然后监督有关部门去执行。其他部门互相配合。县委因此摆脱了不必要的事务工作，有时间来加强对区委的领导。区里，也随着转变。全县共五个区，一、二、四三个区转变得较快较好，现在这些区的区委已可以抽出时间来了解全区情况，研究上级指示，进行工作布置，开始克服过去工作上的混乱现象；因此有时间来整顿村支部。和建立支部教育传授站等工作。另一方面，政权、群众团体等部门的工作也转向了主动。已在实际工作中证明，部门工作树立后，不但不会削弱中心工作，而且更好地推动了中心工作。例如一区通过全区村级主要干部会议布置夏征中心工作。布置后，各部门即分别讨论执行办法，这样就更好地保证了中心工作的完成。各村也按系统分片开会讨论如何贯彻上级的方针任务。区级各部门干部下乡后，也各找自己部门的村级干部，检查与推动工作。这样工作就能顺利地进行，任务能够按期完成。而且村干部也有时间来搞好自己的生产了。一区西任村支部书记王明臣，去年只收了三石粮，今年因为多下了一些工夫，就多收了三石粮食。支部也有时间对党员进行教育，提高党员的思想水平与政治水平。
    获鹿县在改善区级领导方法中并已取得以下几点体会：（一）事前应当进行深入的思想教育。开始有些区在接到上级关于这一问题的指示后，曾经发生了这样的偏向，当一区区委书记知道了上级要看改善区级领导方法后就说：“党政分开了，谁也别管谁了！”说罢就背起铺盖下乡去了。其余干部面面相观，不知该到那里去好。在村级干部中也曾发生了取消领导各自为政的自流现象。这说明了有些干部对改善区级领导方法问题还认识不足，因而发生了一些错觉；另一方面，有些人包办代替的习惯确实已经很深，现在要改变他们这种习惯时，思想上是有很大的抵抗。这些都要经过深入的思想教育后才能有所转变。
    （二）改善区级领导方法，必须自上而下进行。过去上级党委也有包办各部门工作的现象。因此，要改善区级领导方法，必须自上而下来进行这个工作，否则是无法改善区级领导的。
    （三）建立与加强部门工作。过去一般是忽视部门工作的，所以不少部门的组织机构，干部配备都是不健全的，党委应具体帮助他们逐步健全起来。
    （二） 　鲁干
    现在把山东各地区级领导的情况与我个人对改善区级领导方法的几点意见，提出来供大家讨论：
    山东有些地区，在抗日战争期间，曾在区级以下设立过乡（每乡十几个村子），以后虽然取消了。但到一九四八年、四九年间，有的地区又重新建立了乡。这样区级领导就存在两种不同的情况：一种是没有设乡的地区，区级领导多采取一揽子领导的方法，主要表现在：区里常常召开全区村干部（包括各部门的干部）大会传达布置工作，回村后也是一揽子式的进行工作。同时各区委委员，分别各带一批干部，住基点村进行工作，分兵把口，各自为政。这种领导方法的形成，首先与地委、县委的领导是分不开的。有些地委、县委也好开一揽子会议，有时地委布置工作，召集区级各系统干部开大会，一到数百人，一下把区里各部门的工作都布置了。当时还认为这是实现具体领导。实际上是包办代替。其他部门等于虚设，很少起作用。其次是区的范围太大，各部门干部太少，领导不过来，因此自然而然地采用了一揽子领导方法。最后是区级主要干部对一般干部认识不足，培养不够，总认为这些干部弱，凡事要亲自动手，结果形成了严重的代替包办工作作风。
    但是建立了乡的区就另一种现象，例如五莲县一个区就有六、七十个庄子，区里除主要干部外，其他干部都分散到乡里担任乡支部书记、乡长、或乡农会主席。这样区级的领导就不用采取一揽子领导方法，而由各部门干部分别通过乡支部书记联席会，乡长联席会，乡农会主席联席会，传达布置工作。在这些会议上，组织典型报告，并进行专门问题的讨论与学习。此外还有的区利用逢集日召开乡干部碰头会。乡干部回乡后，再分别召开乡的各部门会议讨论工作。区里一方面派一定的干部，到各村检查与帮助工作；一方面则用一定干部集中作一两个基点村工作，以便吸取经验，推动全区。这种领导方法是好的，它的好处有如下几点：（一）发挥了区、乡两级集体领导的作用，与各部门的领导作用；（二）领导上及时布置工作，组织汇报，介绍经验，便于培养、教育与提高干部独立工作能力。
    因此关于改善区级领导方法，我除同意侯永同志的意见（见本报十二月十四日《转变区级一揽子领导方法》）外，再补充几点：（一）区的范围最好划得小些，或建立乡的机构，加强乡的领导和各系统的领导作用，建立乡以后，还容易培养与提拔干部，从村干部一下担任区干部确是有一些困难；而乡干部的工作范围则较小，新提拔的干部容易学习掌握；且为半脱离生产，也免于突然离开家庭而使家庭发生困难。（二）区级应多采用集中领导，一般号召与个别指导的方法和通过区与乡的各部门推动工作。区在发出号召后，一方面可在基点村创造典型，推动全区，另一方面可抽出一定干部，到各地检查工作，以改变工作组分兵把口的领导方法。
   （三）
  　魏世英
    改善区级领导方法问题中包括这三方面的问题：改善区委会本身的领导，区委会对村的领导、村级领导等问题。
    首先应该承认有一些区的党委制是不健全的，并没有担负起领导全区工作的任务。在很多区里，区委书记强的，即由区委书记包办一切工作；区长强的，即由区长包办一切工作。而且区委书记和区长认为“不包办不行”，而其他干部也认为“区委书记和区长应该管，家有万口，主事一人”。甚至还有人还这样说：“你包办，我少办！”。各区委委员下去后只在一个基点村工作，也不了解全区情况；在区委会上，也只是“汇报工作，领任务”。但是另一方面，又存在放任自流的现象。例如对武装部门、公安局则采取放任态度，也发生了一些问题。
    其次各区干部到村后，不是通过各部门干部进行工作，而是谁积极就找谁，村干部反映：“鞭打快牛！”这样积极一些的村干部就特别繁忙。另有些区干部到基点村后不仅包办村干部的工作，并包办了区的工作，形成了一级领导。
    某些村级干部特别忙，也就产生了命令主义作风。例如汲县群众虽然养猪的很多，但无圈猪习惯，因此县里号召群众“圈猪积肥”，到区里决定“一律圈猪，说服动员”，到村里就变成“一律圈猪，不圈就罚”。此外各系统不健全，村干部兼职太多，有的支部书记身兼四职。
    从以上情况看来，解决区级领导问题：首先要加强党委制，实行集体领导分工负责的领导制度，并充分运用各系统的组织力量，和吸收劳动英雄模范参加领导工作，这样可以加强与广大群众的联系，加强对工作情况和群众思想情况的了解，便于布置工作，并可以补救部干之不足。其次建立必要的工作制度。在目前应首先建立档案制度，将全区的基本情况存入档案，以便克服过去不了解情况，工作陷于被动的现象。第三，改善领导方法，应自上而下一齐进行，上级各部门对区各部门一方面要布置工作检查工作，另一方面要有计划地帮助下级完成自己的系统工作，发挥自己的作用。第四，健全村级组织机构，并培养村干部工作能力，使之成为一级领导，独立地进行工作。同时注意减少村干部兼职，以便使村干部有时间参加生产，领导生产。但区级领导，应加强对村干部工作的检查。最后，为了达到上述目的，必须加强区级干部对政治的学习，使他们自觉地摆脱事务主义工作，而注意于政治领导。
