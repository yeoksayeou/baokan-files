　　United Struggle to Achieve Comprehensive Peace
    United Front of Japanese Opposition Parties is Forming
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 13th] A united front of opposition parties striving for comprehensive peace is being formed throughout Japan. According to a January 31st report in the Japanese Communist Party newspaper "Party Activity Guidelines," the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party proposed a three-party joint struggle to the Socialist Party and the People's Democratic Party during the gubernatorial election, with the slogan "Comprehensive Peace, Oppose Suppression." Subsequently, the district committees of the Japanese Communist Party in Tokyo also separately proposed to the local Socialist Party and People's Democratic Party organizations to jointly struggle to achieve comprehensive peace. Suwa Masatsugu, the head of the Taito Ward branch of the Socialist Party, has expressed his approval of jointly launching a comprehensive peace movement with the Communist Party, cooperating in daily struggles, and forming a united front against the Liberal Party in local elections. The Toshima Ward branch of the Socialist Party also expressed its willingness to form a united front with the Communist Party to strive for comprehensive peace and oppose war.
    Although the upper echelons of the People's Democratic Party collude with the Liberal Party, some of the party's lower-level organizations also oppose separate peace. The Nakano Ward branch of the party in Tokyo has accepted the Communist Party's request and is willing to jointly struggle to promote comprehensive peace, the withdrawal of all occupying forces after peace, and the achievement of independence.
    After the Tokyo Minato Ward Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a call to various unions within the ward to jointly struggle for comprehensive peace, it has received responses from more than 20 unions.
    According to a United Press dispatch, a united front striving for comprehensive peace is rapidly developing in Kanagawa Prefecture, the heart of Japan's heavy industry. The Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Socialist Party have formed a united front in Kawasaki, Oda, Takatsu, Hodogaya, Kushikawa, and other places in the prefecture to jointly conduct the struggle for comprehensive peace.

　　联合斗争争取全面媾和
    日本在野党派统一战线在形成中
    【新华社十三日讯】争取全面媾和的在野党派统一战线，正在日本各地组成中。据日本共产党报纸“党活动指针”一月三十一日消息：日共东京都委员会曾以“全面媾和、反对镇压”的口号，向社会党与国民民主党提出在知事选举时三党联合斗争的号召。接着，东京市内日共各地区委员会也分别向当地的社会党与国民民主党组织提出联合斗争以争取全面媾和的要求。社会党台东区支部的负责人诹访正次郎已表示赞成与共产党共同展开全面媾和运动，在日常斗争中合作，并在地方选举时结成反自由党的统一战线。丰岛区社会党支部也表示愿与共产党结成统一战线，争取全面媾和与反对战争。
    尽管国民民主党的上层分子与自由党串通一气，但该党的一些下层组织也反对单独媾和。该党东京中野区支部已接受共产党的要求，愿为促进全面媾和、媾和后全部占领军撤退以及争取独立而共同斗争。
    日共东京港区委员会向区内各工会发出为争取全面媾和而共同斗争的号召后，业已获得二十多个工会的响应。
    又据联合通讯社消息：在日本重工业心脏地区神奈川县，争取全面媾和的统一战线正在迅速发展中。共产党与劳农党和社会党在该县川崎、小田、高津、保土谷、串川等地方组成统一战线，共同进行全面媾和的斗争。
