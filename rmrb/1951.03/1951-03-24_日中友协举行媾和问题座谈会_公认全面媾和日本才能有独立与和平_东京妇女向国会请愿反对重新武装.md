Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a United Press report: The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association held a symposium on the issue of a peace treaty on March 9th. Approximately 100 representatives from 26 organizations, including the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party, the Metalworkers' Union, and private business organizations, attended the meeting. The symposium was chaired by Hirano Yoshitaro (Director of the China Research Institute), Vice-Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, and Kuroda Hisao (Chairman of the Labor-Farmer Party), a director of the association. The discussions were lively. Gan Wenfang, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Democratic Promotion Association, vehemently denounced the distorted remarks about the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance as "threatening Japan." He pointed out that this treaty not only posed no threat to the Japanese people but was also a guarantee of Japan's peace and democratization. The Chinese people are not enemies of the Japanese people.
　　The symposium concluded that Japan could not have peace or independence without a comprehensive peace treaty; it was necessary to launch a widespread patriotic movement against a separate peace and rearmament and to strive to complete the task of collecting signatures demanding a comprehensive peace treaty. The meeting also decided to fight against rumors hindering the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a United Press report: About 100 women in Tokyo petitioned the Diet on March 8th, International Women's Day. They put forward the following demands: a comprehensive peace treaty, opposition to rearmament; opposition to the suppression of freedom of speech and assembly; and guarantee of livelihood. After the petition, they gathered about 300 people and held a symposium with Communist Party members of the Diet Kazahaya Hachijuni, Karita, Tajima, and Karasawa, Labor-Farmer Party member Okada Haruo, and National Democratic Party member Sonoda Nao. The meeting discussed the demands they had raised during the petition and supplemented them. They unanimously resolved to write these demands into a protest letter and distribute it to all sectors.

　　日中友协举行媾和问题座谈会
    公认全面媾和日本才能有独立与和平
    东京妇女向国会请愿反对重新武装
    【新华社二十三日讯】据联合通讯社消息：日中友好协会曾于三月九日举行媾和问题座谈会。出席座谈会的有：日本共产党、劳农党、社会党、金属工人工会、私营商业组织等二十六个组织的代表约一百人。座谈会主席由日中友好协会副会长平野义太郎（中国研究所所长）与该会理事黑田寿男（劳农党主席）担任。会上发言热烈。华侨民主促进会主席甘文芳在发言中痛斥关于中苏友好同盟互助条约“威胁日本”的歪曲言论。他指出：这一条约不仅对日本人民没有威胁，而且是日本的和平与民主化的保障。中国人民是不与日本人民为敌的。
    座谈会讨论的结果认为：没有全面和约日本就不能有和平，也不可能有独立；要广泛展开反对单独媾和与重新武装的爱国运动，尽力完成征集要求全面和约签名的任务。会上并决定与阻碍中日两国人民友好的谣言作斗争。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据联合通讯社消息：东京妇女约一百人曾于三月八日国际妇女节向国会请愿。她们提出如下要求：全面媾和，反对重新武装；反对镇压言论与集会自由；保障生活。请愿后，她们又集合了约三百人，与共产党议员风早八十二、苅田、田岛、柄泽，劳农党议员冈田春夫以及国民民主党议员园田直等举行座谈会。会中讨论了她们请愿时所提出的要求，并加以补充，她们一致决议将这些要求写成抗议书，向各界散发。
