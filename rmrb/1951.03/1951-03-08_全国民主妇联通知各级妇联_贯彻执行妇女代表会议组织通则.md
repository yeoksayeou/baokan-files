Xinhua News Agency, March 7th - The All-China Women's Democratic Federation today issued a notice to women's federations at all levels to further implement the Organizational Rules for Women's Representative Conferences, which were adopted at the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the Federation last September. The full text of the notice is as follows:

Since the Organizational Rules for Women's Representative Conferences were adopted at the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the All-China Women's Democratic Federation last September and distributed to various regions for implementation, women's federations in many regions have earnestly utilized this organizational form in the past six months, expanding their connections with women masses and gaining considerable experience. However, women's federations in some regions have not given sufficient attention to this, and some cadres still have some confused ideas about it.

In the future, in order to continue implementing these organizational rules and better execute the task of "uniting all patriotic women and expanding the organization of women masses" as pointed out by Chairman Cai Chang in her article "Further Connect and Educate the Broad Masses of Women Under the Banner of Great Patriotism," women's federations in various regions must do the following two things:

    1.  Cadres of women's federations in various regions must earnestly study these rules and truly grasp their spirit; in particular, leading cadres of women's federations in various regions must earnestly study, personally take action, create experience, educate cadres, and promote the comprehensive development of this work.
    2.  Women's federations at the provincial and municipal levels must, based on the specific local conditions and the original work foundation, follow the principle pointed out by Chairman Cai Chang that "women's federations in all cities and rural areas that have implemented land reform should formulate specific plans this year to universally establish and improve this kind of organization; in areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, key points should be selected now for trial establishment, to gain experience and prepare for universal implementation when land reform is carried out this winter," and formulate specific plans and steps for establishing and improving women's representative conferences this year.

In the process of implementing these organizational rules, various regions should report general situations, new experiences, and problems to the All-China Women's Federation in a timely manner.
