Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Representatives from all circles in the capital held a meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd to welcome Edgar, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Second All-India Peace Congress and member of the World Peace Council; Tsai Hsi-yung, head of the Indonesian delegation to the Second World Peace Congress and member of the World Peace Council; and Paget, representative of the Australian Peace Defense Committee. Those attending the meeting included Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zemin, Xiao San, Cai Tingkai, Hu Yuzhi, Wu Maosun, and representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and government organs, totaling over a thousand people. On the azure blue backdrop of the rostrum hung a huge peace dove and a portrait of Chairman Mao, flanked by large banners proclaiming "Peace Will Surely Triumph Over War" and "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World."

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered a welcoming speech, stating: Today, we welcome our peace-loving friends with great enthusiasm and express our sincere respect to them. American imperialism is attempting to rearm Japan to launch a new world war. We, the people of the East, should strengthen our unity to oppose the sinister schemes of the United States. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of Asia, Australia, and all peace-loving Eastern peoples, including the Japanese people, to defend peace and resolutely implement the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the First Session of the World Peace Council. We hope that you will convey the will of the Chinese people to our brothers in India, Indonesia, and Australia. Peace is indivisible, and the will to defend peace is shared. Today's American imperialists are our common mortal enemies. Unless we shatter their sinister schemes, we will not be able to enjoy the happiness of peaceful construction. Guo Moruo concluded by shouting: The people of Asia and Australia unite and strive to eliminate a new world war! Long live world peace!

Edgar, Tsai Hsi-yung, and Paget delivered speeches successively, unanimously pointing out the profound friendship of the people of their countries towards the Chinese people and their firm will to defend world peace.

Edgar, on behalf of the peace-loving people of India, paid tribute to the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and said: The rearmament of Japan not only threatens China, but also threatens every country in Asia. I hope that all the people of Asia can understand this danger and unite to defend themselves and resist the American threat to our freedom.

In his speech, Tsai Hsi-yung denounced the American forces for using poison gas in Korea and said: All peace-loving people throughout the world must sincerely support and implement the resolutions of the World Peace Council. The Chinese people, together with the peace-loving people of Indonesia, India, Australia, and other countries, will fight side by side for world peace.

Paget stated in his speech: The peace defense movement in Australia has already gained widespread support from the people across the country. The conspiracy of American imperialism to recruit cannon fodder in Australia has been defeated. The Australian people firmly oppose the rearmament of Japan and oppose the establishment of land and naval bases by the United States in Australia. They will never tolerate suffering under Japanese aggression or American occupation.

The meeting concluded with the participants shouting slogans such as "Stop aggressive war!" and "Crush the aggressive schemes of American imperialism!"
