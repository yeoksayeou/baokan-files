(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th) The Northeast People's Government Committee held its Third Enlarged Meeting from February 27th to March 1st. The main agenda of the meeting was to summarize the work of 1950 and discuss the work tasks for 1951.

　　Chairman Gao Gang delivered a report entitled "Consolidate National Defense, Develop the Economy" on the first day of the meeting. In his report, when summarizing the various tasks of 1950, he pointed out: In the past year, the people of Northeast China completed the economic construction plan in the victorious struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, thereby ensuring the needs of national defense construction, substantially improving the people's lives, and laying a material foundation for the development of cultural construction. Over the past year, the political enthusiasm of people from all walks of life has also been further enhanced. The movement integrating patriotism and the internationalist spirit of defending world peace is currently developing with overwhelming force. Because the People's Government adopted the policy of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, social stability was achieved, bandits disappeared, the people were happy, and production was active. Regarding the work tasks for 1951, Chairman Gao Gang pointed out: The general policy is to further build a strong national defense and a strong economic force under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, based on the work of last year. In addition to completing the task of national defense construction, it is required that the total value of Northeast China's publicly-owned industry and crop production in 1951 be increased by 13.8% compared to 1950. In his report, he focused on elaborating the basic experiences of the work in 1950, as well as some issues that should be paid attention to in the work of 1951. Following Chairman Gao Gang's report, Gu Zhuoxin, Minister of Finance of the Northeast People's Government, reported on the 1951 financial budget.

　　On the second and third days of the meeting, Vice-Chairmen Lin Feng, Gao Chongmin, and committee members Che Xiangchen, Wang Xingrang, Yu Guangsheng, and others spoke successively. The speakers unanimously expressed their support for Chairman Gao Gang's report and reported to the meeting on the work of various provinces or departments in 1950, putting forward various opinions on how to complete the 1951 work tasks proposed by Chairman Gao Gang. Vice-Chairman Lin Feng focused on rural work issues in his speech. He pointed out that after the land reform in Northeast China, the rural economy has risen rapidly in recent years. With the restoration and development of agricultural production, middle peasants have become dominant in rural areas. The current tasks of rural work and agricultural production are to continue to increase agricultural productivity on the basis of the New Democratic economy, to make the current middle peasants richer, and to bring the peasants who are still in a state of poverty to the level of middle peasants.

　　At the close of the meeting, Chairman Gao Gang made a brief summary. He emphasized that the key to successfully completing this year's work tasks lies in earnestly improving the work style of cadres at all levels. He said: Many of our comrades are diligent and hardworking; but often their awareness is insufficient. Therefore, we must raise our awareness, promote the style of close contact with the masses, seeking truth from facts, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. He earnestly urged everyone to carefully study the decisions of the higher authorities and truly understand the situation below. He said that without studying the instructions and decisions of the higher authorities, one cannot steadily grasp the policies; without studying the situation below, one cannot discover new things. Work is constantly developing, and the situation is constantly changing, so we cannot be bound by the old ways. If the leadership cannot foresee, it will inevitably fall into blind passivity. He proposed: We must promote the positive factors of all staff members in researching the situation, studying problems, grasping the key points, and paying attention to ideological leadership and business leadership in their work, overcome the busy and chaotic bureaucracy, and resolutely avoid arrogance and complacency. We should wage unremitting struggles against the bad work style of a few people who are detached from the masses, corrupt, and degenerate. In short, we must develop positive factors in all aspects, overcome negative factors, in order to smoothly complete the huge tasks of national defense construction and economic construction in 1951.

　　东北人民政府委员会举行第三次扩大会议
    讨论建设强大的国防与经济力量
    要求今年东北公营工业与农作物生产比去年提高百分之十三点八
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北人民政府委员会于二月二十七日至三月一日举行第三次扩大会议。会议主要议题是总结一九五○年的工作和讨论一九五一年的工作任务。
    高岗主席在会议第一日作了以《巩固国防、发展经济》为题的报告。他在报告中总结一九五○年各项工作时指出：过去一年间，东北人民在抗美援朝保家卫国的胜利斗争中完成了经济建设计划，从而使国防建设的需要得到保证，人民的生活得到了相当的改善，又给文化建设的发展打下了物质基础。一年来，各阶层人民的政治积极性也更为提高，爱国主义与保卫世界和平的国际主义精神融合在一起的运动，目前正以排山倒海之势向前发展。由于人民政府采取了坚决镇压反革命的方针，结果使社会安定，盗匪敛迹，人民高兴，生产积极。对于一九五一年的工作任务，高岗主席指出：总的方针是在毛主席和中央人民政府领导之下，在去年的工作基础上，进一步建设强大的国防力量和强大的经济力量，除了完成国防建设的任务外，要求一九五一年东北公营工业与农作物的生产总值比一九五○年提高百分之十三点八。他在报告中着重阐述了一九五○年工作的基本经验，以及一九五一年工作中应该注意的一些问题。在高岗主席报告后，继由东北人民政府财政部长顾卓新报告一九五一年的财政预算。
    会议第二、三两日，副主席林枫、高崇民和委员车向忱、王兴让、余光生等相继发言。发言者对高岗主席的报告一致表示拥护，并向会议报告了各省或各部门一九五○年的工作概况，提出了如何完成高岗主席所提出的一九五一年工作任务的各种意见。林枫副主席在发言中着重讲了农村工作问题。他指出东北在土地改革以后，几年来农村经济迅速上升。随着农业生产的恢复和发展，农村中中农已占优势。目前农村工作和农业生产的任务，就是要在新民主主义经济基础上继续提高农业生产力，使现在的中农更加富裕，使现在还处于贫困状态的农民达到中农的水平。
    会议闭幕时，高岗主席作了简短的总结。着重指出要很好地完成今年工作任务的关键，在于切实改进各级干部的工作作风。他说：我们许多同志是勤劳奋勉的；但往往有时自觉性不够，因此，必须提高自觉性，发扬密切联系群众、实事求是、开展批评与自我批评的作风。他谆谆告诫大家，要精心研究上级的决定与切实了解下面的情况。他说，不研究上级的指示和决定，就不能稳当地掌握政策；不研究下面的情况，就不能发现新鲜事物。工作不断地发展，情况不断在变化，不能拘泥于过去的一套。领导如果不能预见，就必然陷于盲目被动。他提出：要发扬全体工作人员在工作中研究情况、钻研问题、抓住关键、注意思想领导与业务领导的积极因素，克服忙忙乱乱的官僚主义，力戒骄傲自满。对少数人员脱离群众、贪污腐化的恶劣作风，应该与之作不懈的斗争。总之，要在各方面发展积极因素，克服消极因素，以顺利完成一九五一年巨大的国防建设和经济建设的任务。
