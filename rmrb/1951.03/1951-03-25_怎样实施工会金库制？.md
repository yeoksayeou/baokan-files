How to Implement the Trade Union Treasury System?

The implementation of the trade union treasury system is a relatively important task in the trade union financial system. In the future, all expenditures and income of the trade union, as well as remittances to higher levels and allocations to lower levels, must go through the trade union treasury system, just like the significance of the national central treasury. If we want to systematically organize all kinds of complex income and expenditure, and make planned scheduling and utilization, it will be difficult to achieve the goal without the establishment of this treasury organization. Therefore, the establishment of a trade union treasury system is an important part of doing a good job in trade union financial work. Its main purpose is not only for the bank to act as an agent for collecting and paying and managing various expenses, which is convenient for the unified allocation of trade union funds, but also to ensure the withdrawal of currency and correctly implement the state's currency management policy.

When establishing a trade union treasury, attention should be paid to procedures such as opening an account, paying money, closing accounts, and preparing reports. All levels of trade unions affiliated with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, when establishing a treasury, should go to the local branch or sub-branch of the People's Bank according to the contract, with a letter of introduction from the higher-level trade union to contact the bank and open a deposit account in their own treasury. In addition to the deposit accounts managed by the various levels of trade union organizations themselves, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions opens three accounts in the local bank: "Remittance to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Membership Dues Account," "Remittance to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Culture and Education Funds Account," and "Remittance to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Labor Insurance General Fund Account." These are specially opened for the various levels of trade union organizations to remit funds to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. After each trade union grass-roots organization receives membership dues each month, the financial committee fills out a membership dues payment slip and sends it to the local bank acting as the treasury agent. The bank should transfer the funds to the relevant accounts according to the proportion indicated on the payment slip. For the various levels of trade union organizations in areas where the People's Bank has not established branches or sub-branches, the funds payable to the higher-level trade unions shall be paid level by level to the higher-level trade union that has established a treasury for separate deposit. The funds and labor insurance funds allocated to the trade union by the administration or the capitalist shall be paid by the administration or the capitalist by filling out a payment slip according to regulations, and after the trade union organization reviews and signs it, the administration or the capitalist shall send it to the bank acting as the treasury agent for payment. The membership dues received by the trade union and the funds, cultural and educational funds, etc. allocated to the trade union by the administration or the capitalist shall be submitted to the treasury no later than seven days after the wages are paid in the current month. On the treasury side, the membership dues received in the current month must be closed on the tenth day of the following month, and any further income after the tenth day will be counted as income for the next month. The county federation of trade unions has three types of reports for remittances: a monthly summary table of membership dues income, a monthly summary table of trade union funds allocated by the administration or the capitalist, and a monthly summary table of labor insurance fund income. After the reports are completed, they must be sent to the provincial federation of trade unions to which they belong before the 20th of the current month. For various deposits within the treasury contract, if there are remittance and other situations to the affiliated trade union organizations at all levels, the telegraphic transfer method shall be adopted for remittance level by level. In case of emergency, trade union organizations at all levels may request telegraphic transfer within the limited amount. The funds remitted by the lower level shall be directly transferred to the higher-level treasury by the bank in the manner of remittance or transfer within the prescribed time limit.

　　怎样实施工会金库制？
    工会金库制度的实施，在工会财务制度中，是一项比较重要的工作。今后工会的一切开支与收入，上解与下拨的款项，都要通过工会金库的系统，正如国家中央金库的意义一样。如果要把各项繁复的收支有系统地整理出来，作有计划的调度与运用，没有这个金库机构的建立，就很难达到目的。因此，工会建立金库制度实为搞好工会财务工作重要的一环。它的主要目的，不仅由银行代理收支保管各种经费，便于工会款项统一调拨，而且还保证了货币回笼并正确地执行了国家的货币管理政策。
    建立工会金库，要注意开户、缴款、结账与编制表报等手续。中华全国总工会所属各级工会，在建立金库时，应根据合同，至所在地的人民银行的分行、支行，拿着上级工会所开的介绍信与银行联系，开设自己金库内的存款户头。除了以上各级工会组织本身所管的存款户外，中华全国总工会在当地银行开设“上解中华全国总工会会费户”“上解中华全国总工会文化教育费户”、“上解中华全国总工会劳动保险总基金户”三个户头，这是为各级工会组织上解中华全国总工会款项特别开立的。各工会基层组织每月收到会费后，由财务委员填具会费缴款书，送当地代理金库的银行，银行应按缴款书所分的比例数转入各有关账户。凡人民银行未设立分行、支行机构地区的各级工会组织，对于上级工会应缴款项，由各该工会组织逐级上缴至有金库建立的上级工会分别解库。行政或资方拨交工会的经费、劳动保险基金，各按规定由行政或资方填具缴款书，经工会组织复核签字后，由行政或资方送代理金库的银行缴款。工会所收入的会费及行政或资方拨交工会的经费，文化教育费等，均应在本月发放工资后最迟不过七日内，送交金库。在金库方面，当月所收的会费，必须以下月十日为结账日期，在十日后继续再有收入时，就算作下月的收入。县总工会对于上解款项计有三种表报：会费收入汇总月计表、行政或资方拨交工会经费汇总月计表、及劳动保险基金收入汇总月计表，编造完竣，须在当月二十日前寄自己所属省总工会。关于金库合同以内各项存款，对于所属各级工会组织要有拨付汇款等情形，一律采用信汇方式，逐级下拨。如有紧急情形，各级工会组织，得在限定金额内请求电汇。下级上解的款项，由银行按规定期限用汇款或划拨的方式，直接转解上级金库。
