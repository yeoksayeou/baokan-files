　　On Handling China's Literary Heritage
       Feng Zhi
    In the 87th issue of "People's Literature," there is an editor's note preceding an article on Bai Juyi. The note says: "The victory of the New Democratic Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have made the excellent ancient Chinese culture begin to become the common wealth of the broad masses of the people." This is an exciting statement. Now that state power belongs to the people, our long-buried cultural heritage should naturally return to the hands of the people. Literary works and works of art were originally the results of the people's hard work, but in the past, the rulers used their superior position to plunder them. Once these achievements entered their courtyards, their beautiful brilliance was obscured, and the voices of justice were disturbed. Therefore, before the people gained power, they often hated not only the rulers but also the palaces they lived in and the works of art displayed in the palaces, without asking who built those magnificent palaces or who created the works of art. This feeling of hatred was natural and even justifiable during the revolutionary process. But now, the people's enemies have been eliminated, and the palaces and works of art that were occupied by the rulers for many years have returned to the people. How magnificent and beautiful Tiananmen Square is now! It was built by the working people brick by brick, tile by tile, and since the day it was completed, it has been occupied by the rulers. People used to feel fear and terror in front of it, but now when we walk in front of it, no one is without infinite joy and infinite hope. With the establishment of the people's regime, it radiates the light that has been buried for hundreds of years.
    We hope that all our excellent cultural heritage, whether as large as the grottoes of Longmen and Yungang, or as small as a five-character poem like "Hoeing millet under the midday sun," can, like Tiananmen, release all the heat they possess and emit the light they can emit. Therefore, when we face them, it is no longer a question of whether or not to accept them, but of how to accept them, how to handle them, and how to make them shine.
    Since the establishment of our People's Republic, especially since the Resist-America, Aid-Korea campaign, the Chinese people have all felt that their motherland is lovable and worth loving. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals are all willing to contribute their greatest strength to defend and build this lovely motherland. In such a high tide of patriotism, all the creations of our ancestors have aroused even greater respect and love from the people. Recently, we have read many articles praising and studying these creations. They contain somewhat pioneering and tentative qualities, but they foreshadow a rich future. Kalinin said in "On Communist Education": "Soviet patriotism is the direct heir to all the creative endeavors of our ancestors who pushed our people forward." Therefore, we love our motherland and our cultural heritage because we deeply realize that we should be the direct heirs to the excellent aspects of all the creations of our ancestors.
    When facing our rich literary heritage, it is naturally not a question of whether or not to accept it, but of how to accept it. We cannot deny that today there is a considerable distance between us and our classical literature. This distance is caused by two phenomena: one is the linguistic distance. The language of many classical masterpieces is no longer our modern language. Some places require annotations, but past annotators have often not only failed to explain the characteristics of their language, but have also greatly damaged it. The other is that those works have been subjected to long-term feudal rule, which has led to the distortion and obscurity of the meanings they contain. No matter how beautiful the poetry and prose, they seem to be wearing an inappropriate feudal coat on the surface, making people daunted. If the distance created by these two phenomena is not eliminated, those literary heritages may still have to continue to be placed on ancient, dusty bookshelves, and it will be difficult for them to become the common wealth of the people.
    To overcome the linguistic isolation between us and our classical literature, appropriate annotations are needed. However, many past annotators did not pay attention to the development of literature or ignore the changes in language, but only regarded words as fixed things. For example, someone used to say that in Han Yu's prose and Du Fu's poems, every word and phrase has its origin. Therefore, annotators had to find the so-called earliest origin for every word and phrase in their poems and prose, but they did not know that Han Yu's prose and Du Fu's poems were major developments in their era, and they had many new creations in grammar. Han Yu said, "Only remove clichés," and Du Fu said, "If my words do not startle men, I'd rather die," which both illustrate their efforts to get rid of inheritance and to adopt contemporary new language in their works. However, incompetent annotators turned around and put a hat of "every word and phrase has its origin" on them, as if they were complimenting them, but in fact, they were giving them the greatest slander. Take the four sentences at the beginning of Du Fu's "The Recruiting Officer of Shih-hao" as an example: "At dusk I lodged in Shih-hao Village, An officer was arresting people at night. The old man climbed over the wall and ran away; The old woman went out to see the gate." It is written naturally and lively, which is exactly the Tang Dynasty language that Du Fu refined. When we recite it now, we still feel that fresh and lively tone. But how did his annotator, Qiu Zhaoao, annotate it? Regarding "at dusk lodged," he annotated it as "Xie Lingyun's poem, Lodging in Yan at dusk"; regarding "old man," he annotated it as "Tao Qian's poem, insignificant old men"; regarding "climbed over the wall and ran away," he annotated it as "Strategies of the Warring States, Zengzi's mother threw down her shuttle and climbed over the wall to run away"; regarding "went out to see the gate," he annotated it as "Ballad of the Eastern Gate, Threw his sword and went out the gate." Qiu Zhaoao's "Detailed Annotations of Du Shaoling's Collection" is the most popular due to the reprint by the Commercial Press, and it has its merits in other aspects, but the part about annotating "origins" is clumsy and ridiculous! He did not know that the "origin" of many of Du Fu's poems was the language of the Tang Dynasty, not any ancient book. Even now, there are still many annotators of poetry collections who use this method to annotate poems, which not only fails to bring the works closer to the readers, but instead makes the works farther away from the readers. Such annotation, in addition to making people feel that the annotator has spent some effort in vain, does not benefit the original work and the reader in the slightest!
    If we want to make these works the common wealth of the people, then some so-called "authoritative" annotated versions of the past may have to be adapted anew. The most important thing for an annotator of a great poet's works is to have the ability to distinguish, to deeply understand the poet's language, and to distinguish which are inherited and which are creative. Regarding the inherited part, especially the use of allusions that no poet in the past could avoid, of course, its origin should be noted; as for the original, that is, the poet personally refined from the folk, the annotator must give it clarification. In this way, many works will vividly appear before us, allowing us to understand and accept them through language.
    But this is not enough. We need to give these works a new evaluation. In the past, as long as great works were loved by the people, they would also be used by the ruling class, attaching some meanings to them that were beneficial to the rulers. The Confucian view of the "Book of Songs" and the "Songs of Chu" is a very obvious example. After the May Fourth Movement, this view seemed to have changed, but then some liberal critics appeared, "appreciating" the ancients based on their own positions and preferences, those who agree with me live, those who oppose me die, with diverse opinions and no consensus. Now that the New Democratic Revolution has been victorious, everyone's eyes are wide open, and we also have a correct yardstick to measure ancient works: all works that love the people, are for the people, and have a complete artistic form are good works. Conversely, works that serve the ruling class cannot be good.
    This yardstick is not difficult to say, but it is not easy to apply it to measure in practice. In the past, the vast folk literature has always been ignored, so most of the works that truly originated from the working people, except for a part of the "Book of Songs" and the "Yuefu Poetry," have been forgotten with the times in our history. But we do not lack excellent poets and writers who have learned the language of the people, understood the life and suffering of the people, and written great works: the most brilliant names among them are Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, Shi Nai'an... these people. Their origins more or less belonged to the class that served the rulers (we will not mention Shi Nai'an here, because we know nothing about his background). Due to their own encounters and the misfortune of the times, they had the opportunity to get close to the people, and they wrote works that loved the people and were for the people based on the poet's conscience. However, limited by the times and class, it was impossible for every chapter of their works to be for the people and stand on the people's position. On the contrary, most of them still wrote about their own joys, sorrows, honors, and disgraces, and it was inevitable that they would praise the rulers and become the spokespersons of the rulers. They often felt great contradictions between the rulers and the people. This contradiction was unavoidable for a progressive poet in the old feudal society, and only progressive poets could feel it; if a poet only stood on the position of his special class, could not see the suffering of the people, and was content with the status quo, what contradictions could there be?
    If we want to clarify the true significance of some classical writers to us, it lies in striving to discover their contradictions. Like their language, we must distinguish from their works which are progressive and which are inherited. We cannot only look at them from one aspect: we cannot only emphasize their progressive aspects in order to praise them, while forgetting to criticize their backward parts; nor can we criticize them by making demands on them that they could not fulfill in their time. For example, Bai Juyi's "Qin Zhong Yin" can make the general dignitaries gnash their teeth in hatred, which is a real situation, but if we insist that these poems can incite peasant revolutions, it would be an unrealistic exaggeration. Conversely, we cannot deny the role played by his "Qin Zhong Yin" and "New Yuefu Poetry" and their great significance in the history of Chinese literature because of his Taoist thought and his life of drinking and escorting prostitutes (which of course should be criticized). We must be cautious and careful in handling literary heritage, and not become anti-historicists.
    But we are not objectivists either. We don't want them to die; we want them to live; we don't want them to die on the bookshelves of the library, we want them to live in the hearts of the people. We want people to know what difficulties our ancestors in the literary and art circles overcame in their society at that time, promoting the development of literature, and how they could not completely get rid of the limitations of the times and class, sometimes revealing narrowness and prejudice. For the former, we praise them and learn from them; for the latter, we criticize them, and at the same time, we also warn ourselves. In this way, their true talents can be revealed, washing away the mud and dirt smeared on them in the past feudal society.
    This work is a simple but fresh work. Simple means seeking truth from facts and humbly studying the ancients and their social conditions at the time from limited materials; fresh means that our new understanding of history will discover a new spirit from their works. But simple does not mean only satisfying the tedious textual research like the past "sorting out national heritage"; fresh also does not mean arbitrarily painting ghost faces on the faces of the ancients with some of their own colored oil paints like some Western European impressionist critics. Finally, we feel that there is another very important point that needs to be raised: when we evaluate classical literature, we should not put our developing new literature outside of our vision.

　　关于处理中国文学遗产
       冯至
    《人民文艺》第八十七期在一篇论白居易的文章的前边有一段编者的按语，按语里说：“新民主主义革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的建立，已使中国古代的优秀文化开始成为广大人民的共同的财富。”这是一句使人兴奋的话。如今国家政权属于人民了，我们长期埋没的文化遗产自然也要回到人民的手里。文学作品和艺术品本来都是人民辛辛苦苦创造的成果，但是在过去被统治者利用他们优越的地位掠夺去了。这些成果一入了他们的庭院，美丽的光彩便被蒙蔽，正义的声音便被搅乱了。所以人民在获得政权之前，由于憎恨统治者也往往憎恨到他们居住的宫殿，以及宫殿里陈列着的艺术品，并不问那些壮丽的宫殿是谁建筑的，艺术品是谁制作的。这种憎恨的情绪在革命过程中是自然的，甚而可以说是正当的。但是现在，人民的敌人消灭了，被统治者霸占多年的宫殿和艺术品又回到人民的手里。现在的天安门是多么雄壮，多么美丽！它是劳动人民一块砖一片瓦地建筑起来的，自从它落成的那一天起就被统治者盘据着，人们在它前边只感到畏惧和恐怖，如今我们在它前边走过，却没有一人不怀着无限的快乐与无限的希望，它随着人民政权的成立放射出埋没了数百年之久的光芒。
    我们愿望我们所有的优秀的文化遗产，不管它们大得像龙门与云岗的石窟，或是小得像一首“锄禾日当午”五言绝句，都能像天安门一样，本着它们所有的热力，放出它们所能放射的光来。所以我们面对着它们，已经不是要不要，接受不接受的问题，而是怎样要，怎样处理，怎样使它们放出光来的问题。
    自从我们人民共和国成立以来，尤其是自从抗美援朝以来，中国的人民没有不感觉自己的祖国是可爱，是值得热爱的了。工人，农人，战士，知识分子，人人都自愿贡献出他最大的力量去保卫和建设这可爱的祖国。在这样的爱国高潮中我们祖先的一切创造也更引起人民的敬爱。近来我们读到不少颂扬和研究这些创造的文章，它们多少含有些肇端的，试探的性质，但它们预示着一个丰富的将来。加里宁在《论共产主义教育》里说：“苏维埃爱国主义乃是那些把我国人民推向前进的我们祖宗们之一切创造事业的直接继承者。”那么，我们爱我们的祖国，爱我们的文化遗产，也由于我们深切意识到我们应该是我们的祖宗之一切创造的优良方面的直接继承者。
    我们面对着我们丰富的文学遗产，当然不是要不要接受，而是怎样接受的问题。我们不能讳言，在今天我们和我们的古典文学之间存在着相当大的距离。这距离是由于两种现象造成的：一种是语言上的距离，许多古典名著的语言已经不是我们现代的语言，有些地方需要注释，而过去的注释家往往不但没有能够解释出它们语言的特质，反而给予很大的破坏；另一种是那些作品经过长期的封建统治，致使它们含有的意义被人曲解，模糊不清，无论多么美好的诗歌和散文，从表面看来都好像穿着一件不相称的封建的外衣，使人望而却步。——这两种现象所造成的距离如果不消除，那些文学遗产恐怕仍不免要继续摆在古老的尘封的书架上，很难能成为人民共有的财富。
    要克服我们和我们古典文学之间的语言上的隔离，就需要适当的注释。但过去的许多注释家既不注意文学的发展，也忽略语言的变化，只把文字当作固定的东西来看。例如从前有人说，韩文杜诗无一字无出处，于是注释家就在他们的诗文里一字一辞都要找到所谓最早的出处，却不知韩愈的散文和杜甫的诗在他们时代里是大的发展，他们在语法上有许多新的创造。韩愈说，“惟陈言之务去”，杜甫说，“语不惊人死不休”，这都在说明他们要摆脱因袭，要把当代的新语言采用在自己作品里的努力。而低能的注释家却反过来给他们扣上一顶“无一字无出处”的帽子，好像是恭维他们，事实上是给他们一个最大的诬蔑。就以杜甫《石壕吏》开端的四句而论：“暮投石壕村，有吏夜捉人，老翁逾墙走，老妇出看门”，写得又自然，又活泼，这正是杜甫所提炼的唐代的语言，我们现在诵读，依然感到那种新鲜活泼的语气。但是他的注释者仇兆鳌怎样注呢？关于“暮投”，他注作“谢灵运诗，冥投剡中宿”；关于“老翁”，他注作“陶潜诗，区区诸老翁”；关于“逾墙走”，他注作“战国策，曾子之母，投杼逾墙而走”；关于“出看门”，他注作“乐府东门行，投剑出门去”。仇兆鳌的《杜少陵集详注》由于商务印书馆的翻印，流行最广，在旁的方面有它可取的地方，可是关于注解“出处”的这一部分却是笨拙可笑！他不知道杜甫许多诗句的“出处”是唐代的语言，而不是任何一部古籍。直到现在，还有许多诗集的注者用这个方法来注诗，不但不能使作品和读者接近，反倒使作品离读者更远了。这样的注法除了使人觉得注者费了些劳而无功的气力外，对于原作品和读者没有半分好处！
    我们要使这些作品成为人民共同的财富，那么过去一些所谓“权威”的注本恐怕都要从新改编。一个注者对于一个伟大诗人的作品最重要的在于具有分辨的能力，他能深深地领会这个诗人的语言，分辨出哪些是因袭的，哪些是创造的。关于因袭的部分，尤其是从前任何诗人都不能避免的典故的运用，当然要注出它的出处；至于独创的，也就是诗人亲自从民间提炼的，注者则须给以阐明。这样，许多作品才会活泼泼地现在我们面前，使我们通过语言来理解它们，接受它们。
    但是这还不够。我们需要给这些作品一个新的评价。过去伟大的作品，只要一被人民爱好，便同时会被统治阶级利用，给它们附会上一些有利于统治者的意义。从前儒家对于《诗经》和《楚词》的看法就是很显明的例子。“五四”以后，这种看法似乎改变了，但是又出现了一些自由主义的批评家，各就自己的立场和爱好来“欣赏”古人，顺我者生，逆我者死，众说纷纭，莫衷一是。如今新民主主义革命胜利，人人的眼前豁然开朗，我们也就有了一个正确的尺度去衡量古代的作品了：凡是爱人民，为人民，具有一个完整的艺术形式的作品都是好作品，反过来说，为统治阶级服务的作品不可能是好的。
    这个尺度说出来不难，实际运用它去衡量却并不容易。过去广大的民间文学一向被人忽视，所以真正从劳动人民里产生的作品，除去诗经和乐府里的一部分外，在我们的历史里大多数都随着时代被忘记了。但是我们并不缺少优秀的诗人和作家，他们学习了人民的语言，体会了人民的生活与痛苦，写出伟大的著作：其中最辉煌的名字是屈原、杜甫、白居易、施耐庵……这些人。他们的出身或多或少都属于为统治者服务的阶级，（施耐庵我们在这里不提，因为关于他的身世我们一点也不知道），由于自身的遭逢与时代的不幸使他们得到机会与人民接近，他们本着诗人的良心写出来他们爱人民，为人民的作品。但是他们受了时代和阶级的限制，他们的作品不可能每一章都是为人民，站在人民的立场。相反地，写自己悲欢荣辱的还是占大多数，就是颂扬统治者，成为统治者的代言的，也在所难免。在统治者与人民中间他们常常感到极大的矛盾。这矛盾在旧日的封建社会里对于一个进步诗人是无法避免的，并且也只有进步的诗人才能感到；若是一个诗人只站在自己特殊阶级的立场，看不见人民的痛苦，安心于现状，还有什么矛盾可言呢？
    我们若要阐明一些古典作家对于我们的真正意义，就在于努力去发现他们的矛盾，像是对于他们的语言一样，我们要从他们的作品里分辨出哪一些是进步的，哪一些是因袭的。我们不能只从一方面去看他们：既不能因为要表扬他们只强调他们进步的方面，而忘却批评他们落后的部分；也不能因为要批判他们而向他们提出他们在他们时代里不能办到的要求。例如白居易的《秦中吟》能使一般权贵读后切齿痛恨，是实在的情形，但若硬说这些诗能鼓动农民革命，就成为不切实际的夸张了。反过来说，也不能因为他的道家思想，饮酒携妓的生活（这当然要予以批判）而否定他的《秦中吟》与《新乐府》所发生的作用与在中国文学史上伟大的意义。——我们对于文学遗产的处理，要审慎小心，不要成为反历史主义者。
    但是我们也不是客观主义者。我们不要让它们死，我们要让它们活；不要让它们死在图书馆的书架子上，要让它们活在人民的心里。我们要让人知道，我们文艺界的祖先在他们那时的社会里曾经克制了什么样的困难，推进着文学向前发展，而他们又怎样不可能完全摆脱时代和阶级的限制有时呈露出狭窄与偏私。对于前者，我们表扬他们，学习他们；对于后者，我们批判他们，同时我们也自加警惕。这样，他们的真实才能显现出来，洗涤掉过去封建社会里在他们身上涂抹的泥垢。
    这工作是一个朴实而又新鲜的工作。朴实是实事求是，从有限的材料中虚心研究古人和他当时的社会情况；新鲜是由于我们对于历史的新认识会从他们的作品里发现新的精神。但是朴实绝不等于像过去“整理国故”那样只满足于烦琐的考证；新鲜也不等于像一些西欧印象派的批评家似地用些自己的彩色油墨在古人的面上任意描画鬼脸。最后，我们觉得还有很重要的一点需要提出：在我们评介古典文学时，不要把我们正在发展着的新文学放在视界的外边。
