　　Introduction to "Gold-Dollar Imperialism"

    "Gold-Dollar Imperialism" by A. Leontiev, translated by Ge Xin, published by World Knowledge Press, January 1951, 431 pages, price 15,000 yuan.

    A. Leontiev's new book, "Gold-Dollar Imperialism," is a good book. It starkly dissects the essence of American imperialism and points out the inevitability of its aggressive policies' failure. The book is divided into four parts: The first part (Chapter 1) briefly introduces the development history of American imperialism, using facts to puncture the myth of American imperialism's apologists who insist that America grew up "peacefully." The second part (Chapters 2 and 3) analyzes how, after the Second World War, American imperialism, amidst a gradually increasing economic crisis, followed in Hitler's footsteps. The third part (Chapters 4, 5, and 6), as indicated by the book's original title, "Gold-Dollar Imperialism in Western Europe," is the core of the book. The fourth part (Chapter 7) is the conclusion, pointing out that the world peace camp resisting imperialist aggression is increasingly developing to occupy a dominant position, and the aggressive policies of imperialism are bound to fail.

    In the first part, the author uses historical facts to prove that the growth and expansion of American imperialism, like all capitalist powers, were achieved through bloody violent massacres and despicable deceptive plundering methods.

    For example, when the United States declared independence in 1776, its territory was only 386,000 square miles, but by the end of the 19th century, its territory had expanded tenfold. The means of obtaining territory was war. According to the history of the American army published in 1903, the United States fought 114 times after the War of Independence, with a total of 8,600 battles and engagements. The United States seized much land and colonies from Britain, Mexico, and Spain through war. But what best demonstrates the bloody history of the development of American capitalism is its inhumane, protracted extermination of the unarmed Native Americans. "Many tribes that formerly possessed vast territories were exterminated merely because their land was coveted by American colonists." The history of the primitive accumulation of American capitalism is a bloody history of the massacre of Native Americans.

    The author quotes US President Theodore Roosevelt's evaluation of the US annexation of Louisiana in 1803, which illustrates that aggression and territorial expansion are innate desires of the American bourgeoisie: "This alone clearly proves that we are consciously going down the path of expansion... We are among those brave and enterprising nations who can take multiple risks in order to be among the world powers... A nation that expands its borders, that is a nation that is on the path to a great future."

    In 1900, a US Senator, who was then one of President McKinley's "like-minded men," delivered the following speech: "The Philippine Islands will always be ours... Directly behind the Philippines, there is the unlimited Chinese market. We cannot abandon the Philippines, nor can we abandon China... We cannot let go of the opportunity that has opened up for us in the East. We cannot abandon the mission of our race; God has entrusted civilization to this race."

    After the 20th century, the United States used the means of "interfering in internal affairs" to ravage the countries of Latin America, and under the banner of Pan-Americanism, step by step established a hegemony controlling the Western Hemisphere.

    The armed intervention of the United States in the early Soviet Republic after the October Revolution demonstrated the particularly strong essence of "the most insane imperialism." American imperialism used gold dollars to support the imperialist anti-Soviet crusade and directly inserted bayonets into Soviet territory. The author quotes openly and secretly declassified official documents to confirm that the United States was the head and organizer of imperialist intervention in the Soviet Union. Wilson, whom Lenin called "the chieftain of American multi-millionaires, the lackey of capitalist swindlers," openly called on "the armies of the Allied Powers to attack Russia from several directions." In Wilson's plan, methods for the division of the Caucasus, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Central Asia, and Russia were drawn up.

    The author cites irrefutable facts to prove that the US monopoly capital groups colluded with Hitler to revive the military and economic potential of German imperialism. Dulles, the vicious warmonger who is today plotting to revive the military forces of Japanese imperialism, was then a protector and friend of Hitler's fascism. The author also exposes the blood ties between DuPont, Morgan, Rockefeller, Lamont, Dillon Read and German financial oligarchs. These, in the end, plunged humanity into the fire of the Second World War.

    In the second part, the author points out that the result of the Second World War led to a further deterioration of the general crisis of capitalism, and caused essential changes in the international situation favorable to the forces of peace and democracy. The author summarizes five characteristics of the international situation after the Second World War:

    First, the socialist Soviet Union was not weakened in the war, but its political, economic, and military power was increasingly strengthened, and the Soviet Union's prestige and proportion on the international stage greatly increased. The victory of the Soviet Union's socialist economic construction pointed out a clear path for the people of capitalist countries and colonial countries.

    Second, many countries in Central and Southeastern Europe have broken away from the imperialist system, which has further enlarged the cracks in the capitalist world system, and further reduced the territory and scope of capitalist exploitation and oppression.

    Third, due to the collapse of the fascist forces of Germany, Japan, and Italy, the world imperialist system suffered irreparable damage, and the most ferocious teams of international reactionaries have been defeated and eliminated for a long time. The American imperialism's plot to turn a dead horse into a live horse is being met with increasingly strong resistance from the people of the world.

    Fourth, the crisis of the colonial system continues to sharpen, and the upsurge of the liberation movement of the people of colonial and dependent countries is constantly and extensively destroying the back door of capitalism. In particular, the victory of the great Chinese people, who account for nearly a quarter of the world's population, indicates that the imperialist aggressive advantage in Asia is gone forever.

    Fifth, all imperialist countries are generally weakened, and only the United States is in a hegemonic position, which inevitably makes the contradictions between American imperialism and British and French imperialism increasingly acute. The imbalance of capitalist development has reached its peak, which puts the entire imperialist system in a very unstable and mutually exclusive situation.

    Under the conditions of the general crisis of capitalism, the capitalist economic crisis is unprecedentedly serious. The reality of development has shattered the sophistry of American "exceptionalism." The industrial production of all capitalist countries, including the United States, is increasingly in conflict with the narrow basis of domestic requirements and the reduced scope of foreign markets.

    In this situation, the American ruling group has to try to find a way out by creating a war crisis. Therefore, the American imperialism's violent plunder plans and aggressive policies are not the result of its strength, but the result of its internal weakness and inability to solve its domestic difficulties and contradictions.

    In domestic rule in the United States, its corruption has been further strengthened.

    The book outlines the situation of the sharp division of domestic economic life in the United States into two extremes.

    In 1948, American monopoly capitalists obtained a profit of 20.8 billion US dollars, exceeding all historical records. At the same time, in January 1949, the total number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the United States reached 12 million; in 1947, a quarter of the families in the country could not make ends meet; in early 1949, one out of every seven city residents was starving.

    The profits of monopoly capitalists have increased enormously, but the national taxes they bear have decreased instead. During the war, the pre-tax profit in 1944 was 24.3 billion US dollars, and the post-tax profit (of course, this is the hidden profit) was 10.4 billion US dollars; in 1948, the pre-tax profit was 34 billion US dollars, an increase of 40% over 1944, and the post-tax profit in the same year was 20.8 billion US dollars, an increase of 100% over the post-tax profit in 1944. The actual profit in 1948 increased by 10.4 billion US dollars, while the taxes paid were reduced by 700 million US dollars.

    The author also exposes the ugly face of the so-called "American way of life." A British workers' delegation, after visiting Ford's slave laborers in Detroit, Ford's workers worked all day in the air evaporated with sulfur and in the roaring of non-stop machines. One British worker said, "If a worker dares to scratch his head, his hand will be beaten immediately."

    Attacked by the increasingly powerful economic crisis, American monopoly capitalists desperately expanded their aggression against foreign countries, seizing markets, seizing raw materials, and seizing investment sites, in an attempt to free themselves from their dying fate at the expense of foreign people.

    The third part of the book analyzes the gold-dollar imperialism's aggressive policies in Western Europe after the war—from the Marshall Plan to the North Atlantic Treaty.

    The author analyzes the economic situation in Western Europe after the war: universal malignant inflation resulting from the war, and inflation everywhere has become a supplementary means of increasing monopoly wealth and reducing the living standards of the working masses. In Western Europe, unrestrained inflation and unscrupulous black market speculation were combined to deepen the overall collapse and disorder of the national economy. The author points out that Western European economies have historically had the characteristic that they rely on the agricultural countries of Southeastern and Central Europe and colonial dependent countries to import consumer necessities of grain and raw materials, and export industrial manufactured goods to these places. Due to the fact that after the war, many countries in Southeastern and Central Europe broke away from the shackles of imperialism, and the national liberation struggles of colonial countries, coupled with the stubborn anti-Soviet and anti-people high-pressure policies of the reactionary ruling class in Western Europe, made them inevitably suffer from the crisis of declining trade, increased financial deficits, and industrial stagnation. This made them have to fall into the arms of American slave owners. But here again there was a contradiction. Marshall confessed: "The food and other necessities that Europe has needed to import from abroad—mainly from the United States—in the past three or four years are so much greater than its ability to pay for today that it must have material supplementary assistance, otherwise it should endure the most cruel economic, social and political tests."

    The Marshall Plan cannot solve this contradiction. It is mainly the export of gold dollars from the US Treasury to purchase exported American goods. No matter how the Western European countries dedicate their national economic, political and even military sovereignty with both hands, American imperialism cannot satisfy the needs of these people who are called "ragged rascals" by the British Labour Party. The number of aid has been repeatedly reduced, from the initially proposed 29 billion US dollars to the appropriation of 4 billion US dollars in the first 15 months (starting from April 1948).

    The Marshall Plan in fact deepened the economic crisis in Western Europe. Since the Marshall Plan actually means that the United States supervises the industry, foreign trade, currency and financial systems of the Western European countries receiving assistance, these countries have to reorganize their economies under the conditions favorable to the economic and strategic interests of the United States. Many countries are forced to purchase products from the United States or the countries designated by the United States. Many countries are forced to reduce industrial production that is beneficial to their own country, resulting in a further decline in the socio-economic activities of Western European countries.

    The Western European reactionaries, who were unable to get off the tiger, had to continue to accept the bitter fruits caused by their own anti-people and anti-Soviet policies, and followed the wheels of American imperialism towards the abyss of destruction. After the Marshall Plan, American imperialism carried out a series of policies to provoke new wars in Western Europe. Despite the slavish dedication of national sovereignty by the reactionary bourgeoisie and right-wing socialists in Western Europe, the conclusion of the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the advocacy of the reactionary theory of the "United States of Europe," due to the increasing opposition of the democratic forces of the Western European people, and the growth of the anti-imperialist forces of the world people, the weakness of American imperialism is increasingly exposed, and the imperialist war concert is increasingly discordant. At the same time, in the American war plan, the rearmament of West Germany is the "trump card." This American policy of reviving the German fascist aggressive forces is contrary to the vested interests of all European countries, which further aggravates the wrangling between imperialists.

    The author concludes that neither the "Marshall Plan" nor the "North Atlantic Treaty" nor the boundless arms race can save the arrival of the economic crisis of the capitalist countries, especially the United States. Similarly, it is also impossible to unite and revitalize the reactionary forces in the world. On the contrary, the contradictions of imperialism are therefore more intensified. The so-called "Western unity" is nothing more than a fiction to deceive the most honest people.

    In the final part, the author once again mentioned that "the victory of the great Chinese people, who have broken away from the long-standing oppression of feudal slavery and foreign imperialism, is of worldwide historical significance." The author also introduced the general situation of the increasingly powerful peace and democracy camp. The strength of the anti-imperialist camp resisting war provocations is growing and consolidating every day. The powerful movement of the people of all countries to defend peace is able to stop the threat of new wars. The people of all countries not only desire peace, but also are prepared to fight for peace with action. This is the fundamental guarantee of lasting world peace.

　　《金圆帝国主义》介绍   
      艾符
    苏联Ａ·列昂节夫著葛辛译世界知识社一九五一年一月版四三一页定价一五○○○元
    Ａ·列昂节夫的新著《金圆帝国主义》是一本好书，它赤裸裸地解剖了美国帝国主义的本质，并指出其侵略政策失败的必然性。全书分作四个部分：第一部分（第一章），扼要地介绍了美国帝国主义发展史，用事实戳穿了美国帝国主义的辩护士硬说美国是“和平”长成的神话；第二部分（第二、三章）分析美帝国主义如何在第二次世界大战后逐渐增大的经济危机中，步上希特勒的后尘；第三部分（第四、五、六章）正如本书原名《金圆帝国主义在西欧》所标明的，是全书的核心部分；第四部分（第七章）是结论，指出反抗帝国主义侵略的世界和平阵营力量日渐发展至占压倒优势地位，帝国主义的侵略政策必然失败。
    在第一部分中，作者用历史的事实证明：美帝国主义的成长和扩张，和一切资本主义列强一样，是用血腥的暴力屠杀和卑污的欺骗等掠夺方法来实现的。
    例如：美国在一七七六年宣布独立的时候，领土面积只有三十八万六千平方英里，但到了十九世纪终了时，领土面积已扩张了十倍。取得领土的手段是战争，据一九○三年出版的美国军队史所载，美国在独立战争以后，曾作战一百十四次，共发生八千六百次会战和交锋。美国借战败英国、墨西哥和西班牙，从这些国家手中夺得许多土地和殖民地。但最能表现美国资本主义发展的血腥历史的，是它对赤手空拳的印第安人的惨无人道的、经年累月的歼灭，“从前拥有广大领土的许多部落，仅是为了他们的土地为美国殖民者所看中之故而被消灭。”美国资本主义原始积累的历史就是印第安人的被屠杀的流血的历史。
    作者引述了二十世纪初美国总统老罗斯福评价一八○三年美国吞并路易西安纳的话，可以说明侵略和扩张领土是美国资产阶级与生俱来的欲望：“只此一次就能明白地证明我们是自觉地要走上扩张的道路了……我们是置身于这些勇敢而富有进取心的民族之列，他们能作多次的冒险以期居于世界列强之林……扩张其边境的民族，这就是走上伟大的未来道路的民族。”
    一九○○年，美国一个参议员发表了这样的一个演说，这个参议员当时是麦金莱总统“志同道合者之一”，他说：“菲律宾群岛永远是我们的……直接在菲岛后面，有无限的中国市场。我们既不能放弃菲岛，也不能放弃中国……我们不能放过在东方为我们而开放的机会。我们不能放弃我们种族的使命，上帝就是把世界文明委托给这个种族的。”
    二十世纪后，美国用“干涉内政”的手段蹂躏了拉丁美洲各国，在泛美主义旗帜下，一步步建立了控制西半球的霸权。
    美国对十月革命后初期的苏维埃共和国的武装干涉，表现了特别强烈的“最疯狂的帝国主义”的本质，美帝国主义用金圆支持帝国主义反苏十字军，并直接把刺刀插上苏维埃领土。作者引用当时公开的、秘密的官方文件，证实了美国是帝国主义干涉苏联的首脑和组织者。被列宁称为“美国亿万金富翁的魁首，资本家骗子的仆从”的威尔逊，曾经公开号召“各协约国的军队可向俄国数方面进攻”。在威尔逊的计划中，拟定了高加索、乌克兰、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、中亚细亚以及俄罗斯的分割办法。
    作者举述了无可辩驳的事实，证明美国独占资本集团与希特勒勾结，复活德帝国主义的军事经济潜能。今天策划扶植日本帝国主义军事势力复活的凶恶战贩杜勒斯，就是当时希特勒法西斯的庇护者和朋友。作者也揭露了杜邦、摩根、洛克斐勒、拉蒙脱、狄隆·李特与德国金融寡头的血缘。这些，结果就把人类投进第二次世界大战的火海中。
    在第二部分中，作者指出第二次世界大战的结果，引来了资本主义总危机的进一步恶化，并使国际局势发生了有利于和平民主力量的本质的变化。作者概述了第二次世界大战后国际形势的五个特点：
    一，社会主义的苏联不但不曾在战争中削弱，而且它的政治、经济和军事威力愈形增强了，苏联在国际舞台上的威望和比重大大增高。苏联社会主义经济建设的胜利，给资本主义国家以及殖民地国家的人民，指出了明确的道路。
    二，中欧和东南欧许多国家，都脱出了帝国主义体系，这使资本主义世界体系的裂口更加增大，使资本主义剥削的疆土和压迫的范围更加缩小了。
    三，由于德日意法西斯势力的垮台，世界帝国主义体系受到无可挽救的损害，国际反动派最凶恶的几支队伍，已被打倒并长期地消灭了。美帝国主义力图变死马为活马的阴谋，正遭受到世界人民日益强大的抗击。
    四，殖民地制度的危机继续尖锐化，殖民地附属国人民解放运动的高涨，不断扩大地捣毁着资本主义的后门。特别是将近世界人口四分之一的伟大中国人民的胜利，昭示着帝国主义在亚洲的侵略优势一去不可复返。
    五，所有帝国主义国家普遍地削弱，只有美国处于独霸的地位，这不可避免地使美帝国主义与英法帝国主义的矛盾日趋尖锐，资本主义发展的不平衡性达到了最高峰，这使整个帝国主义体系处在非常不稳固的、互相倾轧的境地。
    在资本主义总危机条件下，资本主义的经济危机空前严重起来。现实的发展粉碎了美国“例外论”的诡辩。包括美国在内的一切资本主义国家的工业生产，日益与国内要求的狭隘基础和国外市场的缩减范围发生冲突。
    在这种情况下，美国统治集团就不得不以制造战争危机来妄图找寻出路。因此，美帝国主义狂暴的掠夺计划与侵略政策，便不是它强大的结果，而是它内部虚弱，不能解决其国内困难与矛盾的结果。
    在美国国内统治上，它的腐朽性也更加加强了。
    本书概述了美国国内经济生活向两极尖锐分化的情形。
    一九四八年，美国独占大资本家获得二百零八亿美元的利润，超过一切历史纪录。与此同时，一九四九年一月，美国失业者与半失业者总数达到一千二百万人；在一九四七年，全国四分之一的家庭入不敷出；一九四九年初，每七个城市居民中有一个人挨饿。
    独占资本家利润庞大地增加了，他们负担的国家捐税却反而减少。战时一九四四年未付捐税前的利润是二百四十三亿美元，付出捐税后的利润（当然这是隐瞒了的利润）是一零四亿美元；一九四八年未付捐税的利润是三百四十亿美元，较一九四四年增百分之四十，同年纳税后利润二百零八亿美元，较一九四四年纳税后利润却增加了百分之百。一九四八年实得利润增加一○四亿美元，其所付捐税反减低了七亿美元。
    作者也暴露了所谓“美国生活方式”的丑恶面目。一个英国工人代表团在参观过底特律的福特的奴隶劳动者，福特的工人成天在硫磺蒸发的空气中和不停的机器吼声中工作，一个英国工人说：“如果工人竟敢动搔搔头的念头，他的手马上要挨打。”
    为日益强大的经济危机所袭击的美国独占资本家，拚命扩大对外国的侵略，攫取市场，攫取原料，攫取投资地盘，企图以外国人民的牺牲解脱其死亡的命运。
    本书第三部分分析了战后的金圆帝国主义在西欧的侵略政策—从马歇尔计划到北大西洋公约。
    作者分析了战后西欧的经济情势：由战争而来的普遍的恶性通货膨胀，而通货膨胀到处成为增加独占财富减低劳动大众生活水准的补充手段。在西欧，漫无节制的通货膨胀与肆无忌惮的黑市投机互相结合，加深了国民经济的总崩溃与紊乱。作者指出西欧经济在历史上具有这样的性质：它们依赖东南欧与中欧的农业国及殖民地附属国输入消费必要的粮食原料，并向这些地方输出工业制成品。由于战后东南欧及中欧许多国家挣脱了帝国主义的锁链，以及殖民地国家的人民解放斗争，加上西欧的反动统治阶级固执其反苏与反人民的高压政策，就使它们不可避免地遭受到贸易低落、财政赤字增加、工业停滞的危机。这使得它们不得不跌入美国奴役主的怀抱。但这里又发生了矛盾，马歇尔供称：“由欧洲最近三四年中需要从国外——主要从美国输入的粮食及其他生活必需品，是这样地超过了其今天的支付能力，以致它须有物质的补充援助，否则它便该忍受最惨酷的经济、社会与政治的考验。”
    马歇尔计划不能解决这个矛盾，它主要是由美国国库输出金圆来购买输出的美国货物。而不论西欧各国如何以其国家的经济、政治以至军事主权双手奉献，美帝国主义也不可能满足这些被英国工党称为“衣服褴褛的流氓”的需要。援助的数字一再削减，从最初拟议的二百九十亿美元削减到头十五个月内拨款四十亿美元（从一九四八年四月起）。
    马歇尔计划事实上是使西欧经济危机更深刻化了。由于马歇尔计划实际上是意味着美国对受援助的西欧各国的工业、对外贸易、货币与金融体系的监督，这些国家不得不在有利于美国经济与战略利益的条件下重组其经济，许多国家被迫向美国或美国指定的国家购买产品，许多国家被迫减缩对其本国生产有利的工业生产，结果就使西欧各国的社会经济活动更进一步衰落。
    骑虎难下的西欧各国反动派，不能不继续接受自己反人民和反苏政策造成的苦果，跟着美帝国主义的车轮而驰近毁灭的深渊。马歇尔计划之后，美帝国主义在西欧进行一系列挑拨新战争的政策，尽管西欧反动资产阶级和右翼社会党人奴颜婢膝地奉献国家主权，缔结了《北大西洋公约》，倡言“欧洲合众国”的反动理论，但由于西欧人民民主力量日益增强的反对，以及世界人民反帝国主义力量的增长，美帝国主义的弱点日益暴露，帝国主义战争的合奏是日益格格不入了。同时，在美国战争计划中，是以重新武装西德做“王牌”的，这种复活德国法西斯侵略势力的美国政策，是与一切欧洲国家既有利益相矛盾的，这更加重了帝国主义之间的龃龉。
    作者断定，不论是《马歇尔计划》、《北大西洋公约》、或漫无边际的军备竞赛，都不可能挽救各资本主义国家，首先是美国的经济危机的到来。同样，它也不可能团结和振起全世界的反动力量，相反，帝国主义的矛盾是因此更尖锐化起来，所谓“西方统一”只不过是欺骗老实透顶的人们的虚构。
    在最后一部分中，作者再度提到“挣脱封建奴役与国外帝国主义悠久压迫的伟大中国人民的胜利，是具有全世界历史意义的。”作者更介绍了日益强大的和平民主阵营的一般情况。抵抗战争挑拨者的反帝阵营的力量，每天在增长与强固，各国人民保卫和平的强大运动是能够阻止新战争的威胁的。各国人民不仅愿望和平，而且也准备以行动为和平而斗争，这是世界持久和平的根本的保证。
