How Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, Solved the Rural Distribution Problem
	Zhao Guochen

Editor's Note: After land reform and the gradual restoration and development of agricultural production in the vast rural areas of New China, the demand for cultural nourishment among farmers is becoming increasingly urgent. However, since it is not yet possible to universally establish rural postal services in the vast rural areas of New China, Shangzhi County has created a very good method in this regard, which is worthy of study and promotion in various regions.

    In the six districts of Ujimiy, etc., in Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, the organization of a communication network has not only greatly facilitated farmers in the delivery of letters and newspapers in rural areas, but also generally accelerated the speed of delivery, and significantly increased the number of newspapers distributed.

    Before the establishment of the distribution network in Shangzhi County, the delivery of official documents and the transmission of government orders between districts and villages were resolved through methods such as requisitioning labor, assigning labor, and hiring labor. According to statistics from Ujimiy District, each administrative village had to requisition 50 man-days per year. Not only could they not deliver them in a timely manner, but there were also frequent phenomena such as loss and omission, resulting in considerable waste of manpower and financial resources. The post office's mail carriers only went to the villages once every ten days or half a month, and mail was often accumulated in the agency until someone passing by could take it. Newspapers were only seen in the village once every half a month or twenty days, and each time there was a large pile, so the news became old news, and there were also omissions and jumbled issues. These were the most troublesome things for both the upper and lower levels of the district and villages. Under these circumstances, the masses were unwilling to subscribe to newspapers, and the post office was therefore unable to complete the distribution tasks assigned by higher authorities. In order to solve this problem, the Shangzhi Post Office decided to organize a communication network at the joint meeting of agency directors held in May last year, and selected Ujimiy District as a typical experiment. However, at first, the district government was afraid of increasing the burden on the masses, or randomly raising funds and randomly dispatching labor, which would violate policies, and firmly disagreed. Later, the post office consulted with the Propaganda Department of the CCP County Committee, which obtained the consent and assistance of the County Committee, and introduced the post office to organize in various districts. After repeated discussions between the post office and the various districts, the communication network was successively established in Ujimiy, Mao'ershan, Heilong, Liangzhu, Changshou, Yuanbao, and other six districts within half a month.

    The organizational method of the communication network is based on the district as a unit, and the postal agency as the central point for organization, jointly led by the district government and the agency. The former provides political leadership, and the latter provides business leadership, and the number of people to be set up in the communication network is determined according to the size of the district area, the distance of the mileage, and the conditions of mountain roads or plains (ranging from one to three people). Each communicator runs sixty li per day as a standard, goes out twice every two days, and a route map of the communication network is drawn, so that all villages and settlements, large and small, must be visited. The specific tasks of the communicators are: to deliver government notices, official documents, newspapers, and mail, collect newspaper fees, and accept mail delivered by the masses.

    For the convenience of work, communicators can eat and stay in the village government and the homes of the masses. Meal expenses are deducted from the communicator's remuneration in the form of meal tickets. The average annual remuneration for a communicator is about fifteen to twenty dan of grain (corn), which is borne by the entire district on an average basis.

    Since the establishment of the communication network, the delivery of letters and newspapers in these districts has changed. For example, a teacher in Hongfu Village, Ujimiy District, said: "From June last year to January this year, newspapers were not delivered on time for only two days, because the deliveryman was repairing the car, but we were notified in advance. Even on snowy days when the car could not travel, the newspaper was delivered on horseback." The masses generally reflected: sitting at home, you can receive letters and newspapers, and it is very convenient to send letters out. Not to mention taking a few kilograms of corn a year, I would be willing to take ten kilograms. It would be worth it to delay two days of work less a year.

    After the establishment of the communication network, the number of newspapers distributed in rural areas has increased significantly. For example, in Ujimiy District, from the establishment of the communication network in June last year to January this year, the Songjiang Daily increased from 28 copies to 52 copies, and the Peasant Daily increased from 80 copies to more than 100 copies. Before the establishment of the communication network, the various newspapers ordered and sold in these areas were mostly limited to the village where the postal agency was located or nearby large villages. There were very few newspapers in remote or smaller villages, but since the establishment of the communication network, they have gradually become widespread. For example, in Yuanbao District, there are thirty-six villages and settlements, large and small. Except for one small village without newspapers, all the others subscribe to newspapers. Among them, Xiaosanjia Village has only four households, but it subscribes to one copy of the Northeast Daily and three copies of the Peasant Daily. According to statistics from the Yuanbao Agency in Yuanbao District, this agency sold a total of 84 copies of the Northeast Daily and other newspapers before May last year. From June to January this year, it has increased to 166 copies, an increase of about 100 percent. The mail in Ujimiy District also increased from 20 pieces to 40 pieces during the same period.

    These fully demonstrate that the establishment of the communication network has played an important role in the development of rural distribution business and postal business.

　　松江省尚志县是怎样解决农村发行问题的？
       赵国臣
    编者按：新中国广大农村中的农民，在土地改革，农业生产逐渐恢复和发展之后，对文化食粮的需要日益迫切。但由于新中国广大农村尚不可能普遍建立乡村邮政，在这种情况下，如何解决农村的发行问题，尚志县在这方面创造了一个很好的办法，值得各地加以研究和推广。
    松江省尚志县的乌吉密等六个区，由于组织了通讯网，不但在农村中信件、报纸寄递上使农民得到了很大的方便，同时寄递的速度也普遍地加快了，报纸的发行数目也有显著的增加。
    尚志县未成立发行网以前，区村间的公文递送、政令传达，均靠摊工、派工、雇工等办法来解决。据乌吉密区的统计，每一行政村每年要摊五十个人工，他们不但不能及时送达，而且常有丢失遗漏等现象发生，人力财力都有不少浪费。邮局的邮递员十天或半月才到村里去一次，邮件经常积压在代办所里，等“便人”捎走。报纸在村里要半月或二十天才能看到一次，每次一大堆，新闻变成了旧闻，而且还有缺漏、期数颠倒等情形。这些都是区村上下一致最感头痛的事。在这种情形下，群众多不愿订报，邮局因此不能完成上级分配的发行任务。为要解决这一问题，尚志邮局在去年五月召开的代办所长联席会议上决定组织通讯网，并选定乌吉密区作典型试验。但最初区政府怕增加群众负担，或乱筹款、乱支差，以致违犯政策，坚不同意，后来邮局又与中共县委宣传部商量，即获得了县委的同意与协助，并介绍邮局到各区去组织，经邮局与各区反复讨论之后，半个月内即在乌吉密、帽儿山、黑龙、亮珠、长寿、元宝等六个区先后成立了通讯网。
    通讯网的组织办法，是以区为单位，以邮政代办所为中心点进行组织，由区政府与代办所共同领导。前者从政治上领导，后者在业务上领导，并根据区的面积大小、里程远近、山路或平原等条件决定通讯网应设的人数（一人至三人不等）。每个通讯员，以每日跑六十里路为标准，每两天出班一次，并画出了通讯网的路线图，大小村屯都要走到。通讯员的具体任务是：投送政府通知公文以及报刊邮件等，同时收取报费，并接受群众寄递的邮件。
    通讯员为了工作上的方便，可在村政府及群众家里食宿，饭费采取给饭票方式，在通讯员待遇内扣除。一个通讯员一年的待遇，平均约十五石至二十石粮（苞米），由全区平均负担。
    自通讯网成立以后，这几区的信件、报纸投递就改观了，如乌吉密区洪福村的教员说：“从去年六月到今年一月，只有两天报未按时送到，那是因为投递员修车子，但都事先通知我们的。就是雪天不能行车，也骑着马把报送来。”群众都普遍反映：坐在家里可以收到信、报，寄信出去也很方便，别说一年拿几斤苞米，就拿十斤我也愿意，一年少耽误两天工就有了。
    通讯网成立后，报纸在农村的发行数目已有显著的增加。如乌吉密区从去年六月通讯网成立后到今年一月止，松江日报，从二十八份增加到了五十二份，农民报从八十份增加到了一百多份。通讯网未成立前，这些地区订销的各种报纸，大都只限于邮政代办所驻在的村或附近的大村，较远或较小的屯，很少有报，但自通讯网成立后都已逐渐普遍了。如元宝区大小村屯三十六个，除一小屯无报外，其余都订有报纸，其中如小三甲屯只有四户人家，就订有东北日报一份，农民报三份。又据元宝区元宝代办所统计，该代办所去年五月以前销东北日报等共计八十四份，从六月到今年一月已增到一百六十六份，约增加一倍。乌吉密区的邮件，也在同一时期内从二十件增加到四十件。
    这些充分说明通讯网的建立对于农村发行业务与邮政业务的发展，起了重要的作用。
