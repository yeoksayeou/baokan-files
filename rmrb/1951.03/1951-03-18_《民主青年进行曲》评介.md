　　Review of "March of the Democratic Youth"
     Zhou Rong
    The Chinese student movement, inheriting the tradition of the May Fourth Movement, played an indelible role in the struggle of the Chinese people. The most important reason for this is that the Chinese student movement, due to the leadership and support of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class, became a powerful component of the Chinese people's great struggle against imperialism and its running dogs' brutal oppression of the Chinese people. "March of the Democratic Youth," which has been moved from the stage to the screen, is a rather successful film that correctly depicts the true face of the Chinese student movement based on its true features.

    The film depicts the events that took place during the "May 20th" anti-hunger, anti-civil war student movement in Beijing in 1947 (on the eve of the Chinese revolution's victory). However, it centrally reflects the face and characteristics of the Chinese student movement: that is, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese student movement, and the support of the working class.

    In the events depicted in the film, the story of a neutral, troubled, and hesitant youth, Fang Zheren, who finally transforms under the influence of the masses, vividly reflects the process of the vast number of Chinese intellectuals participating in the revolutionary struggle, and reflects the victory of the policy of winning over the vast number of intellectuals to participate in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Fang Zheren in "March of the Democratic Youth" is a kind-hearted intellectual youth and also a typical middle-of-the-roader. He has enthusiasm and ideals. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was driven by simple patriotism and participated in Chiang Kai-shek's fascist "Youth Army." When he discovered that he had been deceived by the fascist dictator, he became silent, built his own small world with books, and placed his hopes on the illusion of "industrializing the country." Even after the vigorous struggle began, he was still unwilling to break the shell of individualism that bound him. Finally, when he received the news that his father's factory had closed down, he decided to leave school for personal reasons, for his family, and to escape from reality. At the peak of his ideological development, the despicable and shameless conspiracy carried out by special agents among middle-of-the-roaders like Fang Zheren was exposed by the masses. Fang Zheren was caught in a mood of mixed grief and anger. At this time, the torrent of the "May 20th" patriotic student movement, under the leadership of the Party, reached a climax, and also brought Fang Zheren the power to completely transform. Fang Zheren joined the ranks of the struggle, and countless Fang Zherens dedicated their strength in the struggle.

    In the film, although the depiction of the elder sister, a character who embodies the Party's leadership, is not powerful enough, and the image of this character is not fully shaped, the impression she gives is still profound. This is because the results of the Party's leadership are correctly reflected in the struggle depicted in the entire film. For this reason, in the hearts of the audience, as the story of the film develops, they are always aware of the existence of this character who embodies the Party's leadership. In the hearts of the audience, she is closely linked to the fate of every character in the entire story.

    The depiction of the parade scene of the "May 20th" student movement, as well as the appearance of the printing worker Zhu Guisheng in prison, are also very moving scenes in this film. The reason why the depiction of the parade scene is moving is not only because of the students' heroic struggle against the special agents who suppressed the parade, but also because, through this fierce struggle, it vividly depicts how they gained the support of the workers in the struggle. This is not simply due to the workers' sympathy for the student struggle, but reflects the position of the Chinese working class with a high degree of political consciousness in the mass struggle. They consciously support this struggle because it is an inseparable part of the entire people's struggle. The heroic image in "March of the Democratic Youth," the appearance of the printing worker Zhu Guisheng in prison, similarly demonstrates that this film has a strong ideological and militant character. Because the printing worker Zhu Guisheng, who was arrested for printing propaganda materials for the students, endured all kinds of torture by the enemy and never told the enemy the names of the students. Before his heroic sacrifice, he told the arrested students that the final victory was coming. Although this is only a very short scene, it makes the great image of a hero eternally stand before us, and that is the image of the Chinese working class. With the leadership of the vanguard of the working class and the support of the working masses, the struggle of the Chinese people can shine so brilliantly in human history, and make our struggle always strong and unyielding, until the entire Chinese people achieve the final victory.

　　《民主青年进行曲》评介
     周容
    继承了“五四”传统的中国学生运动，在中国人民的斗争中曾经发挥了不可磨灭的作用。这原因，最重要的是：中国的学生运动，由于取得了中国共产党和中国工人阶级的领导与支持，使它成为中国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗对中国人民的残酷压迫的伟大斗争中一个有力的组成部分。从舞台搬上银幕的“民主青年进行曲”，就是根据中国学生运动的真实面貌，正确地描写中国学生运动的一部相当成功的电影。
    影片所描写的是一九四七年（中国革命胜利的前夜）北京“五、二○”反饥饿、反内战的学生运动中所发生的事件，但是它却集中地反映了中国学生运动的面貌和特点：这就是中国共产党在中国学生运动中的正确的领导，以及工人阶级的支持。
    在影片所描写的事件中，通过一个中立、苦闷、彷徨的青年方哲仁的思想斗争，在群众的争取与影响下终于转变的故事，形象地反映了中国广大知识青年参加革命斗争的过程，反映了在中国共产党的领导下争取广大知识青年参加革命斗争的政策的胜利。《民主青年进行曲》中的方哲仁，是一个善良的知识青年，也是一个典型的中间分子。他有热情，有理想，在抗战中，曾为单纯的爱国心所驱使，参加过蒋介石法西斯的“青年军”。当他发现受了法西斯独裁者的欺骗，他沉默了，用书本筑起自己的小天地，把希望寄托在“工业建国”的空想上，直至轰轰烈烈的斗争开始以后，他仍然不愿意打碎束缚自己的个人主义的躯壳。最后，当他得到了父亲的工厂倒闭的消息，为了个人，为了家庭，为了对现实的逃避，他决定离开学校。就在他这个思想发展的顶点上，特务们在方哲仁等中间分子中所进行的卑鄙无耻的阴谋被群众揭穿了。方哲仁陷在悲愤交加的心情中了。这时“五、二○”学生爱国运动的洪流，在党的领导下，达到了高潮，也给方哲仁带来了彻底转变的力量。方哲仁走进了斗争的行列，无数个方哲仁在斗争中献出了自己的力量。
    在影片中，对于体现党的领导的人物大姐的描写虽然还觉得不够有力，对这个人物的形象的塑造还不够完全，但她给人的印象仍是深刻的。这是因为在全部影片所描写的斗争中正确地反映了党的领导的结果。由于这个原因，在观众的心里随着影片故事的发展，时时都意识到这一位体现党的领导的人物的存在，在观众的心里，她和整个故事的每一个人物的命运紧密地联结在一起。
    对“五、二○”学生运动的游行场面的描写，以及印刷工人朱桂生在监狱中的出现，也是这部影片中十分动人的场面。对游行场面的描写之所以动人，不仅是由于学生对镇压游行的特务的英勇斗争，而且通过这一个激烈的斗争，鲜明地描写了他们在斗争中如何获得了工人们的支持。这并不单纯是由于工人们对于学生斗争的同情，而是反映了有着高度政治觉悟的中国工人阶级在群众斗争中的立场。他们自觉地支持这个斗争，因为它是整个人民斗争的不可分的一部分。《民主青年进行曲》中的英雄的形象，印刷工人朱桂生在监狱中的出现，同样表现了这部影片的思想性及战斗性是很强的。因为给学生印刷宣传品而被捕的印刷工人朱桂生，受尽了敌人的各种酷刑而始终不对敌人说出学生的名字，并且在英勇牺牲之前，在被捕的学生面前告诉他们最后的胜利就要来了。这虽然只是一个很短的场面，但它却使一位英雄的巨大的形象永恒地屹立在我们的面前，这就是中国工人阶级的形象。有了工人阶级先锋队的领导与工人群众的支持，中国人民的斗争才能在人类的历史上发出这样灿烂的光芒，并使我们的斗争始终坚强不屈，一直到整个中国人民获得了最后的胜利。
