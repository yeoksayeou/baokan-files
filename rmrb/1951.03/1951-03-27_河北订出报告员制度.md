　　Hebei Establishes a Reporter System
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses Throughout the Party," has appointed 29 comrades, including Lin Tie, Ma Guorui, Yang Xiufeng, Jin Cheng, Wang Guanghua, Xue Xun, Li Ziguang, and Gu Yunting, to serve as provincial-level reporters. The Hebei Provincial Committee also convened the first meeting of reporters on March 19th. The tasks of the reporters were determined at the meeting: (1) Reporters should systematically and organizedly attend various mass gatherings and representative conferences (including Party congresses, people's congresses, youth, women, cooperative, and other representative conferences, and propagandist representative conferences, etc.) at or above the county level throughout the province to make political reports, at least once every two months. (2) In addition to making political reports at certain joint meetings of county-level and above branch secretaries, propagandist representative conferences, or propagandist conferences, reporters should also regularly publish political reports in newspapers or broadcast them on the radio, in order to guide the work of propagandists throughout the province and provide propagandists with propaganda materials. (3) Regularly and periodically make political reports to cadres of provincial-level organs.
    Reporters' working methods: (1) Reporters should combine their inspection work in urban and rural areas with attending the aforementioned mass gatherings or representative conferences held locally to make political reports. (2) When the province launches major political movements, production movements, or commemorates important festivals (such as commemorating May Day and July 1st, etc.), the Provincial Committee will organize provincial-level reporters to go to various areas and cities to make political reports. (3) The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee is responsible for appropriately selecting good speeches from the reporters in each period, which will be submitted to the newspaper for publication or broadcast on the radio after being approved by the Secretary of the Provincial Committee. (4) At present, Baoding City and nearby counties are the key areas for provincial-level reporting, while also taking into account other areas. If the prefectural and municipal committees convene large-scale mass gatherings or representative conferences and need provincial-level reporters to make reports, they may consult with the Provincial Committee in advance for consideration.
    Working system: (1) A meeting of all reporters will generally be convened by the Secretary (or Deputy Secretary) of the Provincial Committee once every two months; when a major political or production movement is launched or there is an urgent work task, a temporary meeting will be convened. At the meeting, the Provincial Committee will review the work of the reporters, summarize their work experience, and discuss and study the work of the reporters for the next two months. (2) The topics and key points of the reporters' reports shall be determined or approved by the Secretary of the Provincial Committee. The topics and key points of reports that must be reviewed by the Secretary of the Provincial Committee should be submitted five days before the report. (3) After the report, the reporter should fill out the "Reporter's Report Result Summary Form" and submit it to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee within five days after the report. At the same time, the revised speech draft should be submitted to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee for selection for publication or broadcast.

　　河北订出报告员制度
    中共河北省委员会，按照中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，指定林铁、马国瑞、杨秀峰、金城、王光华、薛迅、李子光、谷云亭等二十九位同志担任省一级报告员。河北省委并于三月十九日召开首次报告员会议。会上确定了报告员的任务：（一）报告员应有计划、有组织地出席全省范围内县以上各级的各种人民群众集会和代表会议（包括党代表会、人民代表会、青年、妇女、合作等代表会、宣传员代表会等）作政治报告，每两个月至少一次。（二）报告员除应在一定的县以上支部书记联席会、宣传员代表会或宣传员大会上做政治报告外，还应当经常的在报纸上发表或在电台上播送政治报告，借以指导全省宣传员工作，供给宣传员以宣传资料。（三）经常、定期地向省级机关干部作政治报告。
    报告员工作方法：（一）报告员应结合到城乡检查工作，出席当地召开的上述人民群众集会或代表会议作政治报告。（二）当全省开展大的政治运动、生产运动或纪念重要节日（如纪念五一、七一等）时，省委即组织省级报告员分别到各地、市作政治报告。（三）责成省委宣传部适当选择每个时期报告员中好的讲演稿，经省委书记批准送报社发表或在电台上广播。（四）目前暂以保定市及附近县份为省级报告重点地区，同时兼顾其他地区。如地、市委召开大型群众集会，或代表会议，需要省级报告员去做报告时，可预先请示省委商酌。
    工作制度：（一）全体报告员会议，在一般情况下由省委书记（或副书记）每两个月召开一次；当开展一个大的政治、生产运动或有紧急工作任务需要时，则召开临时会议。会议上由省委检查报告员的工作情况，总结报告员的工作经验，并讨论研究下两个月报告员的工作。（二）报告员的报告题目和要点，由省委书记规定或批准，须经省委书记审查的报告题目和要点，应于报告前五日送达。（三）报告员报告后应填写“报告员报告结果汇报表”，于报告后五日内送达省委宣传部。同时将经过整理的讲演稿送交省委宣传部，以便选择发表或广播。
