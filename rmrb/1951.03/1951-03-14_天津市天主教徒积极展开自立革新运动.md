Tianjin is the location of the leadership organizations for many important Catholic orders, including the Society of Jesus, the Vincentians, the Daughters of Charity, the Order of Friars Minor, and the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These churches own a large amount of property in Tianjin, including 19 churches, one university, four middle schools, three hospitals, three seminaries, and other "cultural" and "charitable" enterprises. These churches all accept foreign subsidies and are controlled by foreign missionaries. There are a total of 80 missionaries in Tianjin, about one-third of whom are foreign missionaries.

Like other places, the Catholic Church in Tianjin has long been controlled by imperialist elements, becoming a tool for cultural aggression and anti-people propaganda against our country. Some imperialist elements even carried out espionage activities in China. Most Chinese Catholics were either deceived or oppressed, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. After World War I, the French bishop of Xikai in Tianjin forcibly planted the French flag in Xikai, forcibly occupying our country's territory and turning it into a French concession. This is the famous "Xikai Church Case." During World War II, Bishop Wen Guibin of Xikai, who was French, wanted to sell the property of the Wanghailou Catholic Church. Father Ma, who was Chinese, opposed it and was stripped of his priestly authority. During the Anti-Japanese War, Bu Xiangxian (who has now been driven away by students), the president of Tianjin's Tianjin-Gu University, which was run by the Catholic Church, went to Yan'an as an American reporter with the American representative of the Military Mediation Department. After returning to Tianjin, he fabricated rumors and slanders about the liberated areas. During the Liberation War, special agents in the Tianjin Catholic Church, under the leadership of Yu Bin, attempted to organize a "Catholic Anti-Communist Crusade" and planned to establish five armies in North China to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. However, this attempt did not succeed.

After liberation, imperialist elements continued to use Catholicism as a cover to carry out sabotage and espionage activities, spread anti-communist and anti-Soviet rhetoric, and slander the people's government. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, they spread rumors such as "the US and Chiang Kai-shek are coming back" and how powerful atomic bombs were. Recently, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau also uncovered an American-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization of the international spy Lei Zhenyuan system, the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" and the "People's National Construction Advancement Association," which was disguised under the cover of Catholicism, and seized radio stations, pistols, and other reactionary documents, and arrested the principal and accessory criminals Jin Yupei, Wang Jiwu, and 17 others.

These facts have educated the citizens of Tianjin, the students in church schools, and the vast majority of patriotic Catholics, making them more aware of the crimes of imperialism using Catholicism to carry out aggressive activities. Last October, the students of Xikai Middle School first exposed the various reactionary crimes of the school's principal, Wang Jiwu. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched, the vast majority of faculty and students in Tianjin church schools universally carried out movements to accuse American imperialism. On December 26th of last year, Catholic schools, hospitals, and other units participated in Tianjin's religious groups, schools, hospitals, and other demonstrations against Austin's slander. Encouraged by this patriotic movement, patriotic Catholics in Tianjin convened a symposium of Catholic figures the day after the demonstration. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the Catholic Church should immediately sever its relationship with imperialism and implement self-reliance and renovation. On January 11, 1951, under the strong desire of Tianjin Catholics to renovate, the "Preparatory Committee for the Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance and Renovation Promotion Association" was established, and Mr. Wu Kezhai and 15 others were elected as preparatory committee members. The "Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance and Renovation Declaration" was issued, calling on all patriotic Catholics to: "Stand firmly on the position of the Chinese people, support the Common Program, oppose imperialism, completely sever all ties with imperialism, and implement 'autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation' for the Chinese Catholic Church." The renovation work of the Tianjin Catholic Church gradually unfolded under the leadership and promotion of the "Preparatory Committee for the Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance and Renovation Promotion Association."

The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has supported the Catholic Church's self-reliance and renovation movement from the beginning because it is a patriotic movement of Catholics and is in line with the interests of the Chinese people. However, the imperialist elements in the Catholic Church have carried out all kinds of sabotage, slander, and suppression of the patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics. Wen Guibin, the French bishop of Xikai, and Zheng Huamin (a Dutchman), and other clergymen used "going to hell," "stopping divine services," etc. to threaten the signatories, but this did not frighten the Chinese Catholics. On January 18, several priests, including Hui Ruyu, Li Depei, Li Futing, Liu Zhiyi, and Wang Sixian, also signed to respond to the renovation movement.

After the declaration of the Tianjin Catholic Renovation Movement was published in the newspaper, the heads and presidents of various churches invited Mr. Wu Kezhai to talk. The Chinese priests and the majority of Catholics believed that this declaration was very correct and advocated actively promoting this movement. The Chinese priests of Xikai Church were also very active in the signature movement. To date, nearly a thousand Catholics have signed this declaration. On February 28, the Tianjin Municipal Cultural and Educational Committee invited Catholic priests and representatives of Catholic followers to a forum on anti-imperialist and patriotic issues. At the meeting, the priests and Catholic followers unanimously supported the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, accused the crimes of American imperialism, opposed the rearmament of Japan by the United States, and advocated that the Catholic Church should immediately sever all ties with imperialism. Mayor Huang Jing also attended and spoke, expressing support and endorsement for this patriotic action of the Catholic figures.

However, the imperialist elements in Tianjin Catholicism, Wen Guibin, Zheng Huamin, etc., have not stopped their activities of sabotaging and suppressing the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. When the newspaper published the signatures of several priests responding to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, Wen Guibin wrote to one of them, Father Li Depei, saying: "I saw your name in the newspaper today. I hope you will turn back. From today onwards, your priestly authority will be temporarily suspended. The Catholics in Tianjin have committed a great crime by disobeying the bishop." A Dutch priest at No. 80 Hebei Road invited Wu Kezhai to talk and said: "The suspension of your divine services is temporary. I hope you will turn back." Wen Guibin and others even tried their best to prevent Chinese Catholics from supporting the people's government, saying "The Communist Party is the devil" and "Supporting the people's government means going to hell." When the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress invited Father Hui Ruyu of Xikai Church to participate in the Third People's Congress, Wen Guibin threatened Father Hui greatly, saying, "You participated in the Communist Party's Congress and signed the declaration. You are bound to go to hell." Father Hui could no longer tolerate this threat and dragged Wen Guibin to kneel together in front of the statue of Jesus, asking Jesus to judge: "Is it you, the imperialist element, who should go to hell, or I, the patriotic Catholic, who should go to hell?!" Father Hui's unyielding resistance greatly weakened the reactionary arrogance of the imperialist elements and boosted the confidence of patriotic Catholics.

In order to undermine the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese patriotic Catholics, the imperialist forces in the Catholic Church issued a secret document called "Learning Reference," which completely distorted the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and threatened the Catholics who supported the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. However, the patriotic Catholics not only did not believe this document, but also believed that it was proof of the crimes of the imperialist elements in the Catholic Church in undermining the patriotic movement of the Chinese people and interfering in China's internal affairs. The patriotic Catholics said: Since the imperialist elements claim to have nothing to do with imperialism, admonish Catholics not to participate in political activities, and "strictly prohibit" priests from engaging in political activities, then why do so many Chinese and foreign reactionary elements openly use the church to engage in activities against the Chinese people, and they never say a word? Yu Bin, the former bishop of the Nanjing district, not only engaged in political activities, but also engaged in espionage activities, and is now running a special agent training class in Spain, with evil rumors spreading everywhere. Why doesn't the church prohibit it? The Chinese people oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and oppose the manipulation of Chinese Catholicism by imperialist elements. Why does the church darkly imply that this is "unclear in meaning" and use the crimes of "schism" and "apostasy" to warn the Catholics?

Coincidentally, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau just cracked the special agent case of the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" and the "People's National Construction Advancement Association," exposing the actual activities of imperialist elements under the smoke screen of so-called "super-international" and "super-political" activities to undermine the interests of the Chinese people. The cracking of this case aroused the vigilance of the vast majority of Catholics, enhanced the understanding of the vast number of Catholics in Tianjin about the imperialist conspiracy, and more actively united to launch a frontal struggle against the imperialist elements. A Chinese priest once said to reporters: "I don't believe that we can't do it without foreigners." Father Li Depei said: "We will not go to the hell of imperialism, but ascend to the heaven of the Lord." After recognizing the crimes of imperialism, a large number of Catholic students at Tianjin-Gu University resolutely signed the renovation declaration. Their patriotic and just movement is being widely launched among the vast number of Catholics and is gaining the admiration and sympathy of people from all walks of life.

The reporter believes that the patriotic movement of Catholics in Tianjin will surely achieve final victory, eliminate the influence of imperialism in Tianjin Catholicism, and make Tianjin Catholicism a pure religious cause of the Chinese people.

### 天津市天主教徒积极展开自立革新运动

　　天津市天主教徒积极展开自立革新运动
    天津市是天主教许多重要会系的领导机构所在地，其中主要的有耶稣会、味增爵会、仁爱会、圣芳济格会、圣母圣心会等。这些教会，在天津拥有大量财产，办有教堂十九所，大学一所，中学四所，医院三所，修道院三个及其他“文化”“慈善”事业等。这些教会都接受外国津贴，为外国传教士所控制。全天津市传教士共八十人，其中外国传教士约占三分之一。
    天津市的天主教会也和其他地方一样，长期以来，被帝国主义分子所控制，成为对我国进行文化侵略和反人民宣传的工具，一部分帝国主义分子，还在中国进行间谍活动。大多数中国教徒或受蒙蔽，或受压迫，敢怒而不敢言。第一次世界大战后，天津西开的法国主教硬把法国国旗插在西开，强占我国领土，变为法国租界，这就是有名的“西开教案”事件。第二次世界大战时，西开法国主教文贵宾要把望海楼天主堂的屋产变卖，中国人马神父反对，就被摘掉神权。抗日战争时期，天主教会所办的津沽大学校长卜相贤（现已被学生赶走），曾以美国记者的名义随军调部美国代表到过延安，回津后就对解放区大事造谣污蔑。解放战争时期，天津天主教中的特务分子，在于斌的领导下，曾企图组织“天主教反共十字军”，准备在华北成立五个军，来支援蒋匪。但是这个企图没有实现。
    解放后，帝国主义分子仍利用天主教为掩护，进行破坏和间谍活动，散布反共反苏言论，污蔑人民政府。在抗美援朝运动中，散播“美蒋要回来”，原子弹如何厉害等谣言。最近，天津市公安局又破获了以天主教为掩护的国际特务雷震远系统的美蒋特务组织“公教报国团”及“民众建国协进会”，搜出电台、手枪等反动证件，捕获主从犯金玉培、王际五等十九名。
    这种种事实，教育了天津市民、教会学校中的同学和天主教内绝大多数具有爱国心的教徒们，使他们更加认清了帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略活动的罪恶。去年十月，西开中学的同学首先揭露了该校校长王际五的种种反动罪行。抗美援朝运动展开后，天津教会学校的广大员生普遍进行控诉美帝国主义的运动。去年十二月二十六日天主教学校、医院等单位参加了天津市宗教团体学校医院等反对奥斯汀谰言的示威游行。天津市天主教的爱国教徒受了这个爱国运动的鼓励，在示威游行的第二天，就召开了天主教人士座谈会，在会上大家一致认为天主教应该立即割断受帝国主义利用的关系，实行自立革新。一九五一年一月十一日，在津市教友坚决要求革新的愿望下，成立了“天津市天主教自立革新促进会筹备会”，推吴克斋先生等十六人为筹备委员，发表了“天津市天主教自立革新宣言”，号召一切具有爱国心的天主教徒：“站稳中国人民的立场，拥护共同纲领，反对帝国主义，彻底割断与帝国主义各方面的联系，实行中国天主教的‘自治、自养、自传。’”天津天主教的革新工作，就在“天津市天主教自立革新促进会筹备会”的领导和推动下，逐渐展开。
    天津市人民政府对于天主教的自立革新运动，一开始即予以赞助，因为这是天主教徒的爱国运动，是符合中国人民的利益的。但天主教中的帝国主义分子则对中国教徒的爱国运动实行百般破坏、污蔑和镇压。西开法籍主教文贵宾和教士郑化民（荷兰人）等用“下地狱”、“停止神功”等等来威胁签名者，但这并没有吓倒中国教徒。一月十八日，回如愚、李德培、李辅庭、刘志伊、王思贤等几位神父也签名响应革新运动。
    天津市天主教革新运动的宣言在报上发表后，各堂口的神长和会长纷纷约请吴克斋先生谈话，中国神长和大部分教徒认为这个宣言非常正确，主张积极推动这个运动。西开教堂的中国神父对于签名运动也非常积极。到目前止，在这个宣言上签名的教徒已将近千人。二月二十八日，天津市文教委员会邀集天主教神父及教徒代表人士座谈反帝爱国问题，会上神父教徒们一致拥护三自运动，纷纷控诉美帝国主义的罪行，反对美国重新武装日本，主张天主教应立即割断和帝国主义的一切联系。黄敬市长也出席讲话，对天主教人士的这种爱国行动，表示赞助和支持。
    但是，天津天主教中的帝国主义分子文贵宾、郑化民等并未停止他们的破坏和压迫三自运动的活动。当报上发表了几位神父响应三自运动的签名后，文贵宾就给其中之一的李德培神父写信，说：“今天看报见了你的名字，希望你回头。从今天开始，把你的神权暂挂起来。天津的教友未服从主教，犯了大罪。”河北路八十号荷兰神父请吴克斋谈话，说：“停止你的神功是暂时的，希望你回头。”文贵宾等更极力阻止中国教徒拥护人民政府，说“共产党是魔鬼”，“拥护人民政府就要下地狱”。当天津市各界人民代表会邀请西开教堂回如愚神父参加第三届人民代表会后，文贵宾就对回神父大肆威胁，说“你参加了共产党的代表会又签了名，非下地狱不可。”回神父对于这种威胁忍无可忍，拉着文贵宾要他一同跪在耶稣像前，请耶稣裁判：“看是你帝国主义分子该下地狱，还是我爱国教徒该下地狱！？”回神父这种不屈不挠的反抗，大大打击了帝国主义分子的反动气焰，振奋了爱国天主教徒的信心。
    天主教中的帝国主义势力，为了破坏中国爱国天主教徒的三自运动，曾发出一种名为“学习参考”的秘密文件，对三自运动完全曲解，并对拥护三自运动的教徒加以威吓。但是爱国的教徒们，不但不相信这个文件，而且认为这正是天主教内帝国主义分子破坏中国人民爱国运动和干涉中国内政的罪证。爱国的教徒们说：既然帝国主义分子自称为与帝国主义无关，告诫教徒不要参加政治活动，并“严禁”司铎作政治活动，那么，为什么教内的许多中外反动分子公开利用教会进行反对中国人民的活动，他们却从来不作一声呢？前南京区主教于斌不但作政治活动，而且作间谍活动，现在还在西班牙办特务训练班，恶声四播，教会为什么不禁止？中国人民反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜，反对帝国主义分子操纵中国的天主教，光明正大，为什么教会反而暗射为“意义不清”，用“裂教”、“背教”的罪名来警告教友呢？
    事有凑巧，这时天津市公安局正好破获了“公教报国团”和“民众建国协进会”的特务案件，暴露了帝国主义分子在所谓“超国际”“超政治”的烟幕下所进行的破坏中国人民利益的实际活动。这个案件的破获，引起了绝大多数教徒的警惕，使天津市广大教徒对于帝国主义阴谋的认识提高了一步，并更积极地团结起来，向帝国主义分子展开了正面的斗争。一位中国神父曾对记者说：“和他们干，我不信离开了外国人我们就不行。”李德培神父说：“我们不下帝国主义的地狱，要升天主的天堂。”津沽大学的大批教徒学生在认识了帝国主义的罪恶后，毅然地在革新宣言上签了名。他们的这个爱国的正义的运动，正在广大教徒中广泛展开，并获得各方社会人士的钦佩和同情。
    记者相信，天津市天主教徒的爱国运动一定会得到最后的胜利，肃清帝国主义在天津天主教中的影响，使天津天主教真正成为中国人民自己的纯洁的宗教事业。
