Thinking of My Feet: Disabled Veteran Zhang Shuyi Accuses Japanese Aggressors of Crimes

To the Editor:
    On February 25th, I went to Lingshou County to participate in the first Congress of the Communist Party of China in Lingshou County, Hebei Province. I heard Comrade Liang Zhitian, the County Party Secretary, report that American imperialism wants to rearm the Japanese devils who slaughtered countless Chinese people in order to invade China. This news infuriated me. When I think of the Japanese devils, I think of my feet. In 1941, the Japanese devils launched a frenzied and brutal "mopping-up" campaign against Longquanguan, Fuping County, Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, slaughtering Chinese people. At that time, the unit of the Eighth Route Army I was in engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese devils. I stabbed seven enemies to death in one breath. Japanese planes dropped bombs and blew off my feet. I will never forget this blood feud. Today, American imperialism is妄想 [wangxiang - vainly attempting/plotting] to arm those heinous Japanese militarists again, preparing to invade China again! The wounds of the Chinese people have not yet healed; how can we not resolutely oppose this? Even though I don't have feet, I still have hands. In recent years, I have actively led the masses in production to make up for the losses caused to the Chinese people by the Japanese bandits. Last year, under the correct leadership of the Party and higher-level government, everyone worked hard in production, enabling our agricultural production to exceed pre-war levels. We have just begun to live a stable life and are able to eat our fill. American imperialism wants to arm the defeated Japanese bandits and come back! In order to protect our good days, I swear to the people: as long as I have a breath left, I will not stop fighting the enemy. I will lead the masses in production, increase the strength to resist America and aid Korea, and resolutely oppose the American imperialist rearmament of Japan's aggressive actions.

      想起了我的双脚  荣誉军人张树义控诉日寇罪行编辑同志：
    二月二十五日，我到灵寿县参加中国共产党河北省灵寿县第一次党代表会议，听到县委书记梁芝田同志报告：美帝国主义要重新武装杀害过无数中国人民的日本鬼子，来侵略中国。这事把我的心都气炸了。提起日本鬼子来，我就想起了我的双脚。在一九四一年，日本鬼子疯狂的向晋察冀边区阜平县龙泉关进行屠杀中国人民的残酷的“扫荡”。当时我所在的八路军某部，和日本鬼子展开了激烈的战斗。我一口气刺死了七个敌人。日本飞机投下了炸弹，将我的双脚炸掉。这种血海深仇，我永远不会忘掉。今天，美国帝国主义又妄想武装那万恶滔天的日本军国主义者，准备再向中国侵略。中国人民的伤痛未了，怎能不坚决反对？别看我没有了双脚，但是还有双手。这些年来，我积极的领导群众生产，弥补日寇给中国人民造成的损失。去年在党和上级政府的正确领导下，大家努力生产，使我们的农业生产超过了战前水平。咱们刚开始过安稳的日子，能够吃上顿饱饭了。美国帝国主义要把战败的日本强盗武装起来，卷土重来！为了保护我们美好的日子，我向人民宣誓：只要有一口气在，我就不停止和敌人的斗争，我要好好领导群众生产，增加抗美援朝的力量，坚决反对美国帝国主义重新武装日本的侵略行动。
