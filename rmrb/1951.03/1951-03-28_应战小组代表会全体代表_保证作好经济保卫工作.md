　　All Representatives of Challenge Teams Pledge to Do a Good Job in Economic Defense

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The representatives of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Challenge Teams to the Ma Hengchang Team wrote a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen and Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, saying: Counter-revolutionaries have burned our fifty-eight trams, sabotaged generators, plotted armed riots, and spread rumors to undermine production morale. They are lurking in our factories, trying to smash the rice bowls of our workers. They also said: The people's government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a great good deed for the people. Finally, they said: We guarantee to you that we will do a complete job of safeguarding our work in the challenge to the Ma Hengchang Team, raise our vigilance, and unite all workers to assist the People's Public Security Organs to expose counter-revolutionaries and protect the safety of the people's lives and property.
