　　The Nationwide People Enthusiastically Launch a Movement Against the United States Arming Japan
　　Feng Luren
　　The people of the whole country are now enthusiastically launching a struggle against US imperialism's rearmament of Japan through marches, demonstrations, accusation meetings, and letters to the people of Japan and other Eastern countries. Since January, when the US government sent Dulles to Japan to step up its activities in unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, attempting to drive Japan as a tool for the US to invade China and other Eastern countries, the people in various places have launched this struggle one after another.

　　According to materials published in local newspapers, from January 28th to the end of February, the cities that held rallies and demonstrations against the United States arming Japan include: In North China: Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Cangxian, Xinxiang, Changxindian, Gui Sui, Datong, Yangyuan, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Xuanhua; In Northeast China: Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, Andong, Jiamusi, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Chengde, Lushun-Dalian, Tonghua, Yingkou, Fushun, Tongliao, Zhaodong, Jinzhou, Haicheng, Shanhaiguan, Nehe, Taonan, Acheng, Hailun, Suihua, Jiaohe, Hezhuang; In East China: Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hefei, Bengbu, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Tunxi, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Yangzhou, Suzhou, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Wuxi, Nantong; In Central and South China: Wuhan, Changsha, Changde, Wugang, Guangzhou, Shantou, Haikou, Nanning, Liuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Xinyang, Huaiyang, Ningling, Shashi, Yichang, Linchuan, Tianmen, Xiaogan, Huangpi, Nanchang, Jiujiang; In Northwest China: Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Baoji, Yan'an, Yinchuan, Linxia, Xining, Xianyang, Jiuquan, Tianshui, Hami, Wuwei; In Southwest China: Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Luzhou, Ya'an, Nanchong, Leshan, Yibin, Emei, Zigong, etc., totaling 105 cities. People from all walks of life and various ethnic minorities, including workers, students, women, citizens, cultural and educational circles, medical circles, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, and returned overseas Chinese, participated in the demonstrations, totaling more than 3 million people. In addition to cities, more than 350,000 farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan, Changsha, Hengyang, Kaifeng, Guiyang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, Xinxiang, Harbin and other cities and in the Sanqiao District of Chang'an County in Shaanxi, the Minghe District of Cixi County in Zhejiang, Xuchang County in Henan, and Huaide District of Echeng County in Hubei, have also successively held large-scale demonstrations against the United States and against the United States arming Japan. The men's and women's militia of 36 counties and cities in the North Sichuan Administrative Region held a grand review on February 17. From November last year to the end of February this year, a total of 165 large, medium, and small cities and towns across the country have held rallies and demonstrations against the United States and against the United States arming Japan, with more than 6 million participants. Among them, there were 980,000 workers, 370,000 farmers, 990,000 from the cultural and educational circles (including students, faculty, and artists), 430,000 women, 1,100,000 from the industrial and commercial circles, 300,000 from the religious circles (including church schools and church groups), 190,000 from ethnic minorities, 100,000 from the medical circles, 20,000 returned overseas Chinese, and 1,550,000 people from all walks of life in the cities who jointly held demonstrations.

　　When people in many places held rallies and demonstrations, they made sorrowful accusations against the crimes of the Japanese invaders in slaughtering our compatriots during the war of aggression against China, and unanimously expressed their determination to oppose the United States arming Japan. The rallies and demonstrations in various places passed telegrams to Chairman Mao, General Kim Il-sung, President Ho Chi Minh, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Korean People's Army, and passed letters to the people of Korea, Japan, Vietnam, India, Egypt, and other countries, calling on them to jointly oppose the conspiracy of the United States to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, and to strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.

　　At the same time, a widespread mass accusation movement is also unfolding in various places. People from all walks of life in more than 20 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, and Lushun-Dalian, as well as farmers in some areas of more than ten provinces, including Hebei, Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, have held accusation meetings, accusing the various atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders against our compatriots during the Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945. Through the accusations, the ideological level of the people from all walks of life has been greatly improved, and they have deeply realized the loveliness of the motherland and the hatred of imperialism. When they recalled the cruel killings suffered by our compatriots and the inhuman life during the period of Japanese rule, they deepened their understanding of US imperialism and unanimously expressed that they must not allow the US imperialists to rearm the Japanese militarists whose hands are stained with the blood of the Chinese people. After the accusations, people in many places launched various patriotic competitions. For example, workers in various industries in Shanghai have greatly improved their labor efficiency through accusations. In the past, a few special agents of the Shenxin No. 2 Factory often sabotaged production. After the factory launched an accusation against the United States arming Japan, the masses were outraged, and under the pressure of the masses, individual special agents confessed and repented, which greatly strengthened the factory's production and anti-espionage work. The Chinese people will never forget the deep hatred for the millions of compatriots who were killed by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. At every accusation meeting, everyone unanimously expressed that they would turn grief into strength and resolutely crush the conspiracy of the United States to arm Japan.

　　In the movement against the United States arming Japan, democratic parties and people's organizations in various places have issued statements or declarations, calling on people from all walks of life to step up their support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and to actively participate in the country's construction undertakings to smash the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism. Many people's organizations have also written letters to the Japanese people, calling on the Japanese people to jointly oppose the conspiracy of the United States to arm Japan and drag the Japanese people onto the road to ruin.

　　In order to universally and deeply carry out the movement against the United States arming Japan, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have also held people's representative conferences from all walks of life against the United States arming Japan. The representatives conference in Nanjing decided to focus on opposing the United States arming Japan and deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The city is also preparing to commemorate the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese invaders, in order to further arouse the citizens' hatred for the US imperialism that is rearming Japan to invade China. The preparatory committee for the commemoration of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese invaders decided to launch a wide-ranging signature campaign in the symposium and accusation meeting centered on opposing the United States arming Japan, and to prepare an exhibition of the atrocities of the Japanese invaders and a city-wide memorial meeting. The Shanghai People's Representative Conference against the United States Arming Japan summarized the existing experience of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, discussed and decided on a plan to further develop this great patriotic movement on the existing basis, and combined the opposition to the United States rearming Japan as the basic content with the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and other current central tasks, so as to make the great patriotic movement lasting and regular.

　　全国人民热烈展开反对美国武装日本的运动
    冯鲁仁
    全国人民现在正以游行示威、集会控诉、致函日本及东方各国人民等方式，热烈展开反对美国帝国主义重新武装日本的斗争。自一月间美国政府派遣杜勒斯到日本加紧进行对日片面媾和重新武装日本，企图驱使日本作为美国侵略中国和东方各国的工具的活动以来，各地人民即纷纷发动这一斗争。
    据各地报章所载材料，自一月二十八日至二月底止，举行反对美国武装日本的集会和游行示威的，华北区已有北京、天津、保定、石家庄、唐山、沧县、新乡、长辛店、归绥、大同、阳原、张家口、太原、宣化，东北区已有沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、吉林、安东、佳木斯、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、承德、旅大、通化、营口、抚顺、通辽、肇东、锦州、海城、山海关、讷河、洮南、阿城、海伦、绥化、蛟河、河庄，华东区已有上海、南京、济南、青岛、合肥、蚌埠、厦门、漳州、屯溪、福州、泉州、扬州、苏州、常州、杭州、镇江、芜湖、无锡、南通，中南区已有武汉、长沙、常德、武冈、广州、汕头、海口、南宁、柳州、开封、郑州、许昌、信阳、淮阳、宁陵、沙市、宜昌、临川、天门、孝感、黄陂、南昌、九江，西北区已有西安、兰州、迪化、宝鸡、延安、银川、临夏、西宁、咸阳、酒泉、天水、哈密、武威、西南区已有重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳、泸州、雅安、南充、乐山、宜宾、峨嵋、自贡等共计一百零五个城市，参加示威的有职工、学生、妇女、市民、文教界、医药界、工商界、宗教界、归国华侨等各界和各少数民族的人民共计三百万人以上。除城市以外，武汉、长沙、衡阳、开封、贵阳、南京、芜湖、太原、归绥、新乡、哈尔滨等城市郊区及陕西长安县三桥区、浙江慈溪县鸣鹤区、河南许昌县、湖北鄂城县怀德区的农民共计三十五万以上，也先后举行了抗美援朝、反对美国武装日本的大规模游行示威。川北行政区三十六个县、市的男女农民自卫队曾于二月十七日举行大检阅。总计自去年十一月至今年二月底止，全国已有一百六十五个大、中、小城镇举行了抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的集会和示威游行，参加的人数，已在六百万人以上。其中工人达九十八万，农民达三十七万，文化教育界（包括学生、教职员、文艺工作者等）达九十九万，妇女界达四十三万，工商界达一百一十万，宗教界（包括教会学校及教会团体）达三十万，少数民族达十九万，医药界达十万，归国华侨达两万人，城市各界人民共同举行游行示威的达一百五十五万。
    许多地方的人民在举行游行示威大会时，对日寇在侵华战争中残杀我国同胞的罪行，都进行了悲愤的控诉，并一致表示了反对美国武装日本的决心。各地游行示威大会纷纷通过向毛主席、金日成将军、胡志明主席及中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军致敬的电文，并通过写给朝鲜、日本、越南、印度、埃及等国人民的信件，号召他们共起反对美国片面对日媾和重新武装日本的阴谋，并争取签订全面的公正的对日和约。
    同时，广泛的群众控诉运动也正在各地展开。北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、重庆、西安、沈阳、旅大等二十多个城市各界人民以及河北、绥远、察哈尔、山西、山东、江苏、浙江、江西、湖北、湖南、河南、陕西、四川等十余个省部分地区农民均已分别举行了控诉集会，控诉在一九三七年到一九四五年的中日战争中日寇加诸我国同胞的种种暴行。通过控诉，各界人民的思想水平大为提高，深深体会到祖国的可爱和帝国主义的可恨。当他们回忆在日寇统治时期我国同胞遭受残酷的杀害和过着非人的生活时，更加深了对于美帝国主义的认识，一致表示决不能容许美帝国主义者重新武装双手沾满了中国人民鲜血的日本军国主义者。许多地方的人民经过控诉后，纷纷展开了爱国主义的各种竞赛。如上海各业工人通过控诉，劳动效率更加提高。申新二厂过去常有少数特务分子破坏生产，当该厂掀起反对美国武装日本的控诉后，群情激愤，在群众的压力下，个别特务分子坦白自新，表示悔悟，使该厂生产和防特工作大大加强。中国人民对于在抗日战争中遭日寇杀害的千万同胞的血海深恨，永远也不会忘记。在每个控诉会上，大家一致表示要化悲愤为力量，坚决粉碎美国武装日本的阴谋。
    在反对美国武装日本运动中，各地民主党派和人民团体纷纷发表声明或宣言，号召各阶层人民加紧支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，以及积极参加祖国的各项建设事业，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。并有许多人民团体写信给日本人民，号召日本人民共起反对美国武装日本，把日本人民拖上死路的阴谋。
    为了普遍深入地开展反对美国武装日本的运动，南京、上海等地并举行了反对美国武装日本的各界人民代表会议。南京市召开的各界代表会议决定以反对美国武装日本为中心，深入抗美援朝运动。该市并筹备纪念被日寇屠杀的南京三十万遇难同胞，以便进一步激发市民对于重新武装日本侵略中国的美国帝国主义的仇恨。纪念日寇在南京大屠杀遇难同胞筹备会决定发起在举行以反对美国武装日本为中心的座谈控诉会中广泛征求签名，并筹备日寇暴行展览会和全市性纪念大会。上海市各界人民反对美国武装日本代表会议总结了抗美援朝运动已有的经验，讨论和决定在现有基础上如何进一步展开这一伟大的爱国运动的方案，并以反对美国重新武装日本为基本内容而与镇压反革命活动及其他当前中心工作相结合，使伟大爱国运动持久经常地进行。
