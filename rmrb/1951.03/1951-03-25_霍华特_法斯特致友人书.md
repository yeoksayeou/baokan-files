Howard Fast's Letters to a Friend
Translated by Zhou Hui

Howard Fast is an important revolutionary writer in the United States today. In recent years, he has been bravely and unyieldingly fighting against the reactionary rulers of the United States. His novel "The Children" was banned as early as 1937, and his famous historical novel "Citizen Tom Paine" (with a Chinese translation) was banned from being displayed in college libraries in 1946. Since 1948, he has been continuously persecuted by the American fascist organization "The Committee on Un-American Activities," repeatedly summoned and fined. In 1950, he was once arrested and imprisoned. However, the tyranny of Wall Street could not subdue Fast. In the past year, in addition to participating in activities such as the defense of the world peace movement and writing articles, he also published a treatise "Literature and Reality" and a novel "Proud and Free." Published here are two letters he wrote to his friends in China. On the one hand, he reported on the increasing fascistization of the reactionary rule in the United States; on the other hand, he excitedly told people, especially the Chinese people, that the American people's peace movement is increasing its strength. Fast is 37 years old this year, has written eleven novels, and is one of the editors of the American progressive magazine "Masses & Mainstream." (Editor)

	One, Dear Friend:
	I have received your warm and touching letter sent on December 8th, just the day before Christmas, with snow falling in New York. You probably remember the frantic rush and congestion before Christmas very clearly. I have a feeling that the tragedy of the American people seems even more prominent during the Christmas season. Their inherent goodness is so abundant, but all the upright, warm, and lively feelings of the people are intertwined with the terrible conspiracy of Truman-Acheson. Isn't this a great tragedy?

	A black friend of mine recently said to me that Christmas is the only time of the year – in these few short days, white people behave like black people. I don't think it's just that. I am even more reminded of the exciting facts: for three or four weeks, the seeds of peaceful sentiments have been growing astonishingly in the United States. If your Chinese friends could see, as I do, that thousands of peace committees have been organized all over the United States, and a chorus of peace calls are resounding everywhere, how happy they would be! It is as if the righteous heart of the American people has broken through the walls of hell, built of treachery and lies, that surround them. They shouted their hearts out with this simple sentence: "Withdraw our children from Korea, we want peace."

	Although what I said above is not an exaggeration, it should be explained that this peace movement has not yet been organized, nor has it been led by progressives, except for a small part. It is still only a spontaneous movement, the cry of those frightened and terrorized poor ignorant people. How sad it is to see the ignorance of our people. How little they know about the world situation. I tell you, the simplest farmer in China, under the leadership of the current regime, knows more about world events and international issues than the average intellectual in the United States. Many American workers and farmers don't even know where Korea is, so they don't care. His only hope is that others will not bother him and let him live in peace.

	Our country has great contradictions. It has enormous wealth and power, but it is extremely ignorant. Under these circumstances, of course I cannot predict what will happen in the future. But I know very well that we, who are at the organizational center of this struggle, feel more hopeful now than we did a few months ago. We have powerful allies. Congressman Marcantonio said one night, "Four hundred and seventy-five million Chinese people are on our side, which is really gratifying." I quote two more sentences from Marcantonio's criticism of the current group of congressmen, "They are such a bunch of fools that our legislature has never been so insulted." He also said that their opinions are chaotic, cowardly, and they attack each other; the mythical "unity" in the American ruling class is just a myth. That's all.

	I send you Christmas greetings – to you and your good friends in China. I find that not only with you, but also with us, there is still quite a bit of joy left in our hearts. We have not allowed the United States to become completely fascist. We here often admire the Chinese leaders' confidence in the American masses, the American working class, and the black people, and we also receive unparalleled comfort from this. Believe me, what is happening in the United States today will strengthen this confidence.

	Our Christmas tree is downstairs. The children are thinking about the gifts they will receive on Monday. The children's world is a strange world, and sometimes I think that is the only normal world we should see. But the children in Korea are not like that. The scene of Christmas in America only more sharply portrays the horrors that are happening in Korea.

	Next week, the Communist Party will hold a national conference in New York. I think you would also be proud of what the American Communist Party has done in the past difficult year. They resisted every pressure to force them to go underground or silence them, and now they are still openly and consistently fighting for the happiness of the people.

	I don't know if you have received the Worker's Daily in China. I have never been so proud of this newspaper as I am now.

	I would like to write a lot more, but I can only say that the era we are living in is a novel, terrible, and moving era. In short, it is worth remembering. If the United States becomes fascist, the world will inevitably pay an unimaginable price. A people's America means days without oppression and suffering forever. The authority and power of giants sometimes seem insurmountable, but as we say, it is made of saliva, and the saliva is drying up in all corners. 1951 will not be a comfortable year, but it will not be a dark one either. Bless you and your wife.

						Your sincere friend, Howard Fast

	Two, Dear Friend:

	Your Christmas card has been received. It gave us great pleasure and happiness, as any mail you send brings. I repeatedly recall the time you were in America. My memories are becoming stronger and stronger, because now we ourselves are experiencing the fascist and terrorist course that Europe experienced in those years.

	I cannot fully tell you how quickly everything is changing here. Even just one day earlier, the things that the Truman government is doing today would not have been imaginable. It should be said that we are relatively well-informed, but we have always refused to believe that the Truman government could execute seven innocent black people in Martinsville, Virginia. When this happened—and we did everything we could to fight it—we began to understand what it meant to execute innocent people as hostages. We have no more doubts that these Martinsville black people were deliberately silenced as a warning to all Americans, black or white, who dare to talk about peace.

	Now they have accused the great old man Dr. Du Bois, falsely accusing him of being a foreign spy. Can you imagine this happening? Dr. Du Bois is already eighty-three years old this year. He is the leader of the American Peace Information Center. Perhaps, it is because he is the outstanding figure in the United States fighting for peace, and because his great life has been in service to the people, that he has received this accusation in return. The punishment is five years in prison, which is equivalent to a death sentence for him. You see, this is inevitable; the atrocities in Korea will have repercussions at home. Now this repercussion has occurred. I know we shouldn't be surprised, but we still find it astonishing.

	I want to tell you again that there are still millions and millions of good people in this country. Every force of the American regime is concentrated on stifling the American people's voice for peace. However, the voice of peace cannot be drowned out. Millions and millions of Americans know about this ghastly adventure in Korea, and they are calling for peace. We, those who want to save the country from the hands of the mad and demonic who are driving the country down the path to destruction, we are by no means sad and depressed. We feel that the American people are gradually opening their mouths to speak. Under no circumstances will we give up this struggle. This struggle is developing, and everyone who participates in this struggle feels an unparalleled pride. I don't believe we will do worse than our comrades in other countries, but of course I also think of the many difficulties and pains that still exist in our future.

	I think you will be particularly interested to know this. Our old friend Mr. Querido, you should remember him, the former owner of the Albatross Publishing House in Europe, is now one of the largest publishers in the United States. He decided to burn 150,000 of my books. Rumor has it that he made this decision after being summoned to Washington, where the Committee on Un-American Activities warned him to obey their orders, or he would be responsible for the consequences. Another rumor says that he proposed burning the books himself. Of course, he denies all these rumors, saying that new books need space, and he had to burn my previously published books. Can you imagine? It's a great irony to recall that he himself once cried to me about Hitler destroying all his books. However, this kind of thing is constantly happening, and this is the phenomenon that occurs under the degenerate system of humanity that we call fascism.

	Bless you and your wife.

						Your sincere friend, Howard Fast

　　霍华特·法斯特致友人书
    周慧专译
    霍华特·法斯特是现在美国重要的革命文学家。近几年来他一直英勇不屈地与美国反动统治者进行斗争。他的小说《孩子们》早在一九三七年就被禁止发行，他的著名的历史小说《公民潘恩》（有中译本）在一九四六年就被禁止陈列在大中学图画馆里。从一九四八年起他不断地遭到美国的法西斯机关“非美活动委员会”的迫害，一再被传讯与课罚金。一九五○年他曾一度被捕入狱。但华尔街的横暴行为并不能使法斯特屈服。去年一年中他除参加保卫世界和平运动等活动并撰写文章外，还出版了一本论文《文学与现实》和一本小说《骄傲而自由的人们》。这里发表的是他写给他在中国的朋友的两封信。他一面报道了美国反动统治的日趋法西斯化；一面兴奋地告诉人们，特别是中国人民，美国人民的和平运动正在增大它的力量。法斯特今年三十七岁，著有长篇小说十一部，是美国进步刊物《群众与主流》的编者之一。（编者）
            一、亲爱的朋友：
    你在十二月八日寄出的热情而动人的来信，我已经接到了，恰好是在圣诞节的前一天，纽约正飘着雪花。圣诞节前的那种疯狂的忙乱和拥挤，想来你还记得很清楚。我有这样一个感觉，在圣诞节期中，美国人民的悲剧似乎更显得突出。他们的善良本性是如此之丰富，可是人们的一切正直、温暖而活泼的心情都与杜鲁门——艾奇逊的可怕的阴谋纠结在一起，这岂不是绝大的悲剧？
    我的一位黑人朋友最近对我说，圣诞节是一年之中的唯一的时间——在这短短的几天里，白种人的行为才和黑种人相像。我觉得不仅如此。我更想到那些足以使人兴奋的事实：三四个星期以来，和平情绪的萌芽已经惊人地在美国生长起来了。如果你的中国朋友能够像我一样看到成千个和平委员会已经在美国各地组织起来，到处响起一片和平的呼声，那么，他们将是多么地高兴啊！仿佛是美国人民的正义的心肠已经突破了奸诈与谎话所筑成的，包围着他们的地狱的墙壁。他们用这样一句简单的话喊出了他们的心声：“撤回我们在朝鲜的孩子们，我们要和平”。
    上面我所说的话虽然并没有夸张，但还是应当说明，这种和平运动还没有组织起来，也还没有得到进步人士的领导，除了一小部分以外。它还只是一种自发性的运动，是那些受惊的、被恐怖袭击的可怜的无知的人民的呼声。看到我们人民的如此无知是多么伤心的事啊。他们是怎样地不知道世界形势啊。我告诉你，中国一个最简单的农民，在现在的政权领导之下，他所知道的世界大事和国际问题比美国的一般知识分子所知道的要多得多。许多美国工人和农民还不知道朝鲜在那里，因而也不会去关心。他的希望只是别人不要去麻烦他，让他和平地生活。
    我们的国家是有着极大的矛盾的，它有巨大的财富和力量，可是极端愚昧。在这种情势之下，将来究竟如何，我当然不可能预言。但我深知我们这些在这一斗争的组织中心的人们，现在比我们在几个月以前，更感觉到有希望。我们有强大的盟友。国会议员马肯托纽有一天晚上说，“四亿七千五百万中国人是站在我们这边的，这确实是使人高兴的。”我再引两句马肯托纽批评目前的这批国会议员的话，“他们是这样一群蠢物，我们的立法机关从来不曾这样被污辱过”。他又说他们意见混乱，胆小如鼠，彼此攻讦；美国的统治阶级中的神话似的“一致”，仅仅是一种神话。仅此而已。
    我向你致圣诞节的祝贺——致意你和你在中国的好友。我发现不仅在你那儿，就是在我们这儿也一样，留在心里的欢乐还是不少。我们还没有让美国完全法西斯化。我们在这儿时常敬佩中国领袖对于美国人民大众、美国的工人阶级和黑人，所表现的信心，我们也从这里得到了无上的安慰。相信我吧，今天在美国正在发生的事情必将加强这种信心。
    我们的圣诞树是放在楼下的。儿童们一心想念着他们将在星期一得到的礼物。儿童们的世界是一个奇异的世界，有时我想那才是我们要看到的唯一的正常世界。可是朝鲜的儿童并不是如此的。美国的圣诞节的景象只是更锐利地刻画了在朝鲜正在发生的恐怖事件而已。
    下星期共产党将要在纽约举行全国会议。美国共产党在过去艰苦的一年中的所作所为，我想你也会引以为豪的。他们抗拒了每一种强迫他们转入地下或使他们沉默的压力，现在他们仍然公开地，始终如一地为人民的幸福而斗争。
    我不知道你在中国收到了工人日报没有。我从来没有像现在这样对这个报纸感到骄傲。
    我想写的还很多，但是我只能说我们现在所生活着的时代是新奇的、可怕而动人的时代。一言以蔽之，那是值得牢记的，如果美国法西斯化，世界将必付出不可想像的代价，一个人民的美国意味着永远没有压迫与痛苦的日子。巨人的威权与力量有时看起来是不可以克服的，但是正如我们所说的，他是唾液粘成的，而唾液正在四处角落上干枯。一九五一年将不是安乐的一年，但是也不会是暗淡无光的。祝福你和你的夫人。
                                  你真诚的朋友  霍华特·法斯特
                                一九五○年十二月二十二日
            二、亲爱的朋友：
    你的圣诞节卡片已经收到了，它给我们非常的愉快和幸福，正如你所寄来的任何一个邮件所带来的一样。我再三地回忆到你们在美国的时候。我的回忆越来越强烈，因为现在我们自己正度着当年欧洲所经验的法西斯主义和恐怖的历程。
    我不能充分地告诉你这儿的一切是变得如何迅速，杜鲁门政府今天所做的一件事即使仅仅早一天，也还不是人们所能想像得到的。应该说我们是比较知道得清楚的，然而我们却一直不相信杜鲁门政府竟能把弗吉尼亚州马丁斯威尔城的七个无辜的黑人执行了死刑。当这桩事发生的时候——我们竭全力为它斗争——我们才开始了解把那些无辜的人作为人质而处死，是意味着些什么。我们再也没有疑虑，这些马丁斯威尔城的黑人是被故意地封住了嘴，作为对所有的美国人，无论是黑人或白人，敢于谈和平的人的警告。
    现在他们又控告了那伟大的老人杜波伊博士，诬指他是一个外国的间谍。你能想像这件事竟能发生吗？老杜波伊博士今年已经八十三岁，他是美国和平报道站的领袖。也许，就是为了他是美国的为和平而斗争的杰出人物，为了他的伟大的一生都是为人民服务，所以他得到了这个控告的报酬，那惩罚是五年的监禁，这对于他等于是死刑。你看，这是不可避免的，在朝鲜的兽行是会在国内起反映作用的。现在这反映作用发生了。我知道我们不应当吃惊，但是我们仍然觉得这是诧异的。
    我想再告诉你，在这个国家内，仍然有千千万万的好人。美国政权的每一个力量集中在扼杀美国人民的和平呼声。然而和平之声是不可能淹没的。千千万万的美国人都知道在朝鲜的这种鬼蜮的冒险行为，他们呼吁和平。我们这些人，就是要从那些把国家驱向灭亡之途的疯狂的、妖魔的手中挽救国家的人，我们是决不伤心沮丧的。我们感觉到美国人渐渐地要开口说话了。不管在什么条件之下，我们决不放弃这个斗争。这个斗争正在发展，凡是参加在这个斗争中的人都感到一种无比的骄傲。我不相信我们会做得不如其他国家里的同志们所做的好，可是我当然也想到了我们的前途仍然存在着许多艰难与痛苦。
    我想你若是知道了这件事必然特别感到兴趣。我们的老友客尔伊那奇先生，你该还记得他吧，他是从前欧洲阿尔巴特罗斯出版社的老板，现在是美国最大的一个出版商。他决定烧毁我的十五万本书。谣传他作这种决定是在他被召到华盛顿以后，经非美活动调查委员会警告，要他听从意旨，否则他对后果自负其责。另外一种谣传说是他自己提议焚毁这些书。他当然否认这一切的谣言，他说是为了新出书籍需要地方，不得不把过去早出版的我的书焚毁。你能想像么？回忆从前有一次他自己向我哭诉希特勒毁灭了他所有的书籍一事，简直是极大的一个讽刺。然而这种事正在不断地出现，这就是我们称为法西斯主义这一人类的堕落的制度下所发生的现象。
    祝福你和你的夫人。
                                  你真诚的朋友  霍华特·法斯特
                                  一九五一年二月十六日。
