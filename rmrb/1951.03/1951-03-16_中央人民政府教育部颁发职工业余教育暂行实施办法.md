The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government promulgated
Provisional Implementation Measures for Workers' Spare-Time Education
Chapter I General Principles
Article 1 These measures are formulated in accordance with the "Instructions on Carrying out Workers' Spare-Time Education" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.
Article 2 The purpose of workers' spare-time education is to improve the cultural, political, and technical level of workers, to strengthen national defense and production construction, and to improve the ability of workers to manage the country.
Article 3 At present, workers' spare-time education should generally focus on cultural learning, with literacy education as the key. In areas where a certain period of political enlightenment education has been carried out among workers and production has become relatively stable, factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and organizations should immediately launch literacy campaigns in a planned manner. The target of education should be mainly workers in factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and organizations, with emphasis on cadres and activists, and then extended to the general masses of workers. In areas where a considerable number has been developed, emphasis should be placed on consolidation before further development; in areas where development has not yet taken place, attention should be paid to consolidation during development to avoid simply pursuing numbers.
Article 4 Factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and organizations that have already carried out cultural learning should still conduct political current affairs education regularly, generally using methods such as reports and special lectures, outside of the time for cultural learning.
Article 5 At present, the technical education of general workers should focus on improving operational skills, and methods such as apprenticeship contracts, technical research groups, and seminars can be used outside of the time for cultural learning.
Article 6 For workers who already have a considerable level of education, technical classes and political classes can be organized for more systematic study of technology and political theory.
Article 7 All public and private enterprises should include guarantees for workers' learning in collective contracts or labor-capital contracts. State-owned enterprises should include workers' spare-time education in their administrative work plans. All aspects of labor organization, working hours, housing allocation, expenditure, and construction plans should take into account the conditions needed for workers' learning.
Article 8 Resolutely implement the provision in the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government that "those who participate in learning on study days should not be required to work overtime and should be exempted from participating in various meetings and activities." Within factories, mines, and enterprises, the administration, trade unions, and relevant parties should pay close attention to the allocation and adjustment of workers' spare time. On the principle of not affecting production and workers' health, fixed study days should be specifically stipulated each week through consultation; and fixed meeting and activity days should be uniformly stipulated by the administration, trade unions, and relevant parties. For smaller factories and industries with more dispersed workers, the municipal or district workers' spare-time education committee may request the people's government to stipulate unified study days for the entire city or district. All parties should strictly implement this regulation and should not arbitrarily change or reduce study time.
Article 9 Workers' spare-time education is a vast mass learning movement, and it is necessary to truly rely on the masses of workers and implement the policy of combining leadership with the masses. On the one hand, we must resolutely oppose coercion and formalism, and on the other hand, we must strictly prevent laissez-faire.

Chapter II School System, Curriculum, and Forms of Learning Organization
Article 10 The duration of study for ordinary classes and intermediate classes is temporarily set at two years each, and the duration of study for advanced classes is temporarily set at five years. Localities may extend or shorten the duration of study according to specific circumstances, but graduation should be based on completing the courses prescribed by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. The teaching time should be no less than six hours per week and no less than two hundred and forty hours per year in principle, and can be appropriately changed according to specific circumstances when necessary.
Article 11 Ordinary classes offer two subjects: Chinese language and arithmetic. Intermediate classes offer three subjects: Chinese language, arithmetic, and general knowledge. The curriculum standards and outlines for each subject will be formulated separately. The curriculum for advanced classes can be formulated with reference to the curriculum of worker-peasant rapid middle schools.
Article 12 Ordinary classes can conduct Chinese language and arithmetic courses simultaneously, or they can focus on Chinese language teaching first. The overall timetable for ordinary and intermediate classes and the weekly class schedule are stipulated as follows, and localities can make appropriate changes according to specific teaching conditions.

Article 13 The organization of workers' learning should adopt various forms according to the specific conditions of workers' work and life, funding, equipment, manpower, and other specific conditions in each region and unit, and should not be forced to be uniform. The form of concentrated spare-time schools is generally suitable for ordinary classes with concentrated learning conditions, especially intermediate and advanced classes. In large factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and organizations, workers' spare-time schools of the unit can be organized; several neighboring factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and organizations can jointly run workers' spare-time schools; schools and cultural centers at all levels can also establish affiliated workers' spare-time schools. In addition, small literacy classes, literacy groups, and other decentralized forms of learning should be used flexibly, but they must be carried out in a planned, systematic, and led manner to ensure the planning and regularity of learning. All forms of workers' learning should formulate teaching plans and necessary attendance, examination, reward, and other systems.

Chapter III Teachers and Teaching Materials
Article 14 As much as possible, mobilize workers and family members with more literacy in factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and organizations, school teachers, college and middle school students, staff of social education agencies, and intellectuals who are enthusiastic about serving workers to serve as teachers. However, when classes with concentrated learning have certain conditions, full-time teachers should be hired, and when the number of decentralized literacy classes, groups, etc., reaches a certain number, full-time cadres should also be hired to be responsible for teaching administrative work.
Article 15 The treatment of full-time teachers should generally be equivalent to that of teachers in ordinary schools of the same level. Part-time teachers should in principle be volunteers or semi-volunteers, and the courses and classes they teach should be as fixed as possible. Honorary and material rewards should be given to those who are particularly hardworking and successful.
Article 16 Leaders at all levels should often pay attention to cultivating and improving the political level and teaching ability of teachers, such as organizing teaching research meetings and holding teacher training classes; and should often help teachers understand the life and production of workers.
Article 17 The cultural teaching materials for ordinary and intermediate classes should in principle uniformly adopt the textbooks compiled and approved by the Central Government. Major administrative regions, provinces, cities, and industrial trade unions can compile supplementary teaching materials adapted to local conditions and the characteristics of various industries and based on the curriculum standards and outlines for workers' spare-time education, and report them to the education departments of the people's government at the next higher level for the record. Before the unified teaching materials for advanced classes are compiled, localities can independently select and compile them with reference to the curriculum standards and outlines and teaching materials of worker-peasant rapid middle schools.
Article 18 The teaching materials for political classes shall be designated by the education departments of major administrative regions and reported to the Central Ministry of Education for the record. The teaching materials for technical classes may be compiled and selected by factories, mines, and enterprises themselves, and submitted to the education and industrial management departments of the people's government at the next higher level for examination and approval, and reported to the Ministry of Education and the industrial management departments of the Central People's Government for the record.

Chapter IV Organization, Leadership, and Funding
Article 19 All localities should establish workers' spare-time education committees at all levels in accordance with the "Instructions on Carrying out Workers' Spare-Time Education" issued by the Government Administration Council and the "Organizational Regulations for Workers' Spare-Time Education Committees at All Levels" issued by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. The education departments of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities should strengthen social education institutions, set up full-time cadres, and manage workers' spare-time education work.
Article 20 In factories, mines, and enterprises, workers' spare-time education work should be organized by the trade union of the factory, mine, or enterprise, with the administrative side assisting; in terms of educational administration, it should be managed by the government education department.
Article 21 Schools at all levels should establish affiliated workers' spare-time schools as much as possible. Under the planning of the local workers' spare-time education committee, the principal shall be responsible for the overall management, and full-time or part-time cadres shall be appointed to handle it; however, it is necessary to rely on trade union organizations and mobilize and organize workers to enroll in a planned manner.
Article 22 The funds for workers' spare-time education shall be drawn from the education funds in the cultural and educational funds allocated by the factories, mines, and enterprises to the trade union, and must be used for special purposes, and the enterprise administration should provide necessary assistance; in addition, the government shall allocate a certain amount of funds as key subsidies. Expenditures should be kept as economical as possible to avoid extravagance and waste. Funds can also be appropriately adjusted on a city-wide basis.

Chapter V Supplementary Provisions
Article 23 These measures are approved by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.
