Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: TASS, Paris, March 6th: The preparatory meeting for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France was held in Paris on March 5th to prepare for drafting the agenda for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The representatives of the four countries attending the meeting were: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Davies, and French Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Parodi. In addition to the direct aides of the four countries' representatives, Soviet Ambassador to France Pavlov, U.S. Ambassador to France Bruce, and British Ambassador to France Harvey also attended the meeting.

Note: The suggestion to convene the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was put forward by the Soviet Union in its note to the United States, Britain, and France on November 3rd last year. The Soviet government, based on the spirit of the Prague Conference statement of the Foreign Ministers of the eight countries of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic, suggested convening this conference to consider the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on the elimination of German militarism. On December 22nd, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France replied to the Soviet government, suggesting that the four countries appoint representatives to hold a preparatory meeting in New York to first consult on the agenda for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. On December 30th, the Soviet government sent a note to the three governments, suggesting that the venue for the preparatory meeting should be Moscow, Paris, or London. On January 23rd of this year, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France proposed holding the preparatory meeting for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris. On February 5th, the Soviet government replied to the three governments, expressing no objection to holding the preparatory meeting for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris. On February 19th, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France replied to the Soviet government, suggesting that the preparatory meeting for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference be held in Paris starting on March 5th. The Soviet government announced its agreement to the aforementioned suggestion of the three governments on March 1st.

Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Paris, March 6th: The preparatory meeting of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and Britain for drafting the agenda of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference opened on March 5th at the Rose Marble Palace in Paris.

The participants in the meeting included: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, French Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Parodi, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, and British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Davies.

Members of the Soviet delegation were Lavrentiev, Semenov, and Pavlov; members of the French delegation were Dournel, Magri, and Seydoux; members of the U.S. delegation were Bohlen, Lakehoff, and Bruce; members of the British delegation were Mallet and Harrison.

An agreement was reached at the meeting that the representatives of the four countries would take turns serving as chairman. Parodi served as the chairman of the first meeting.

British representative Davies said that the sole task of this preparatory meeting was to draft the agenda for the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Davies said: "We are not here to solve the problems we are facing, but only to list those problems for discussion by the four foreign ministers." However, in his statement, Davies wanted to portray the policies of the Western countries as policies without any aggressive intentions, and completely attributed the responsibility for the deterioration of relations between the major powers to the Soviet Union. In attempting to determine the causes of international tensions, Davies evaded the most important issue of the re-militarization of West Germany being implemented by the Western occupying powers.

Davies, representing the United States, Britain and France, proposed the following draft agenda for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference:

(1) Studying the reasons for the current international tensions in Europe, and the measures necessary to ensure a lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France.

(2) Completing the Austrian Peace Treaty to rebuild an independent and democratic Austria.

(3) Issues related to the restoration of German unity and preparations for a peace treaty.

Soviet representative Gromyko said that the task of this preparatory meeting had already been decided when the Soviet government and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France exchanged notes on the issue of convening a foreign ministers conference. Gromyko said that it was undoubtedly important to first determine the scope of the issues to be discussed by the four foreign ministers, because the direction of the work of the foreign ministers conference largely depended on how the scope of the issues was determined. The Soviet government had already stated its attitude towards the issue of eliminating German militarism in its recent note. The Soviet government believed that the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulated the elimination of German militarism and prohibited Germany from re-militarizing, was of particular importance for strengthening peace in Europe (and not just Europe) and easing international tensions, which officials of the United States, Britain, and France often talked about.

Gromyko proved that the British representative's attempt to attribute the responsibility for causing international tensions to the Soviet Union was completely bankrupt, and refuted Davies's statement of concern about "the aggression of the Soviet army," considering it a slander against the Soviet Union. Gromyko pointed out that he could not agree with the British representative's assertion that the British government had no aggressive intentions. Gromyko said that it was difficult to get people to agree that behind the arms race, behind the continuous increase of the armies of Britain and certain other countries, and behind the measures currently being taken to establish a West German army and re-militarize Germany, there were peaceful intentions. Everyone knew that currently there was not only the threat of aggression from countries carrying out an arms race, and that acts of aggression had already occurred, and that Britain had also participated in these acts of aggression.

Gromyko continued, saying that the Soviet government believed that fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and prohibiting Germany from re-militarizing was of great significance for strengthening peace and could indeed improve relations between the four countries.

Gromyko further pointed out that the Soviet government believed that the following issues must be included in the agenda of the Four Foreign Ministers:

(1) The issue of the four countries fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and prohibiting Germany from re-militarizing.

(2) The issue of accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing the occupying forces from Germany in accordance with this treaty.

(3) The issue of improving the European situation and immediately starting to reduce the armies of the four countries—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France.

Gromyko said: The significance of the first issue that the Soviet delegation suggested including in the agenda of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference could be determined, at least from the fact that the four countries had certain obligations in the Potsdam Agreement. These obligations must be fulfilled. This was the Soviet government's view. Fulfilling these obligations and not allowing German militarism to revive was very important for ensuring international peace and security, and affected the vital interests of the European people—including the interests of the German people.

Gromyko said: The issue of accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing the occupying forces from Germany in accordance with this treaty was also very important. It had been more than five years since the four countries assumed certain obligations in this regard. However, these obligations had not yet been fulfilled. Germany was still artificially divided. The issue of restoring German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis had not been resolved.

Gromyko continued: The significance of the issue of improving the European situation and immediately starting to reduce the armies of the four countries was also equally obvious. If the British and other governments attending this meeting were truly concerned about eliminating the threat of another war and consolidating peace, they could have the opportunity to show this in action and agree to discuss the issue of reducing the armed forces of the four countries at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The attitude of the governments of the three Western countries towards this proposal of the Soviet Union would show how serious their intentions were on the issues of improving the situation in Europe, easing international tensions, and improving relations between the Soviet Union and the other countries participating in this meeting.

After Gromyko's speech, the US and French representatives suggested a recess.

The next meeting will be held at 3 pm on March 6th.

　　为苏、美、英、法四国外长会议拟订议程
    四国外长会议在法举行预备会
    葛罗米柯主张讨论肃清德国军国主义 
    加速缔结对德和约与四国裁军等问题
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎六日讯：苏、美、英、法四国外长会议预备会议已于三月五日在巴黎召开，准备拟订四国外长会议的议程。出席会议的四国代表为：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯，美国无任所大使耶塞普，英国外交部次官戴维斯，法国外交部秘书长巴罗第。除了四国代表的直接助手外，苏联驻法大使巴甫洛夫，美国驻法大使勃鲁斯及英国驻法大使哈维也出席了会议。
    按：关于召开四国外长会议的建议是苏联在去年十一月三日致美、英、法三国的照会中提出的。苏联政府当时根据苏、波、捷、保、罗、匈、阿与德意志民主共和国八国外长布拉格会议声明的精神，建议召开这一会议，以考虑实施波茨坦会议关于肃清德国军国主义的协定。十二月二十二日，美、英、法三国政府覆照苏联政府，建议四国指派代表在纽约举行预备会议，先行协商四国外长会议的议程。十二月三十日，苏联政府照会三国政府，建议举行预备会议的地点应在莫斯科、巴黎或伦敦。今年一月二十三日，美、英、法三国政府提出在巴黎举行四国外长会议的预备会议，二月五日，苏联政府覆照三国政府，表示不反对在巴黎举行四国外长会议的预备会议。二月十九日，美、英、法三国政府覆照苏联政府，建议于三月五日起在巴黎举行四国外长会议的预备会议，苏联政府于三月一日宣布同意三国政府的上述建议。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎六日电：为起草四国外长会议议程而举行的苏、法、美、英四国外长预备会议已于三月五日在巴黎玫瑰大理石宫开幕。
    参加会议的计有：苏联副外长葛罗米柯，法国外交部秘书长巴罗第，美国无任所大使耶塞普，英国外交部次官戴维斯。
    苏联代表团团员为拉夫伦捷夫，塞米诺夫，巴甫洛夫；法国代表团团员为杜尔纳尔，马格里，赛杜；美国代表团团员为波伦，莱克霍夫，勃鲁斯；英国代表团团员为马列特，哈里逊。
    会中取得协议，四国代表将轮流充任主席。巴罗第任第一次会议主席。
    英国代表戴维斯称：这次预备会议的唯一任务是起草即将到来的四国外长会议议程。戴维斯说：我们在这里并不是要解决那些我们所面对着的问题，而只是要将那些问题列出一个清单，以供四国外长讨论。然而戴维斯在声明中却想把西方国家的政策说成没有任何侵略意图的政策，而把各大国间关系恶化的责任完全归咎于苏联。戴维斯在企图确定国际局势紧张的原因的时候，规避了西方占领国家所正在实施的西德的重新军国主义化这个最为重要的问题。
    戴维斯代表英、美、法三国提出下列的四国外长会议议程草案如下：
    （一）研究目前欧洲国际局势紧张的原因，以及为确保持久地改善苏联和美、英、法三国间的关系所必须的措施。
    （二）完成对奥和约，以重建独立和民主的奥地利。
    （三）有关恢复德国统一及和约准备工作的问题。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯说，这次预备会议的任务，早在苏联政府和美、英、法三国政府就召开外长会议的问题交换照会时，就已经决定了。葛罗米柯说，应该先决定四国外长所要讨论的问题的范围，这一点无疑是很重要的，因为外长会议工作的方向，在很大程度上取决于问题范围如何确定。苏联政府在其最近的照会中已经表明了它对肃清德国军国主义问题的态度。苏联政府认为，规定了肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化的波茨坦协定的履行，对于加强欧洲（而且不仅是欧洲的）的和平与缓和英、法、美三国官方代表常常说到的国际紧张局势，具有特别巨大的重要性。
    葛罗米柯证明英国代表想把造成国际紧张形势的责任归咎于苏联的企图完全破产，并驳斥戴维斯所作担心“苏联军队的侵略”的发言，认为这是对苏联的诽谤。葛罗米柯指出，不能同意英国代表所谓英国政府没有任何侵略的意图的断言。葛罗米柯说，要叫人们同意在整军运动背后、在英国以及其他某些国家的军队之不断增加背后、在那些现正采取的建立西德军队并使德国重新军国主义化的措施的背后，有着什么和平的意向，是很困难的。谁都知道，目前不仅有来自进行整军运动的国家方面的侵略威胁，并且已经发生了侵略的行为，而且英国也参加了这种侵略行为。
    葛罗米柯继称，苏联政府认为，履行关于肃清德国军国主义，并不准德国重新军国主义的波茨坦协定，对于加强和平具有巨大的意义，而且确实能够改善四国之间的关系。
    葛罗米柯进一步指出，苏联政府认为，下列各项问题必须列入四国外长议程之内：
    （一）关于四国履行肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化的波茨坦协定的问题。
    （二）关于加速缔结对德和约以及按照这个和约从德国撤出占领军的问题。
    （三）关于改善欧洲局势和立即开始裁减四国——苏联、美国、英国、法国——军队的问题。
    葛罗米柯说：苏联代表团建议列入四国外长会议议程的第一个问题的意义，至少从四国在波茨坦协定中负有一定的义务这一点上就可以确定。这些义务必须履行。这就是苏联政府的观点。履行这些义务和不许德国军国主义复活，对于确保国际和平与安全是十分重要的，而且影响着欧洲人民的切身利益——包括德国人民的利益在内。
    葛罗米柯说：加速缔结对德和约以及按照这个和约从德国撤出占领军的问题也是十分重要的。自从四国在这一方面承担了一定的义务以来，已经五年多了。但是，这些义务也还没有履行。德国仍然被人为地分裂着。在民主与和平的基础上恢复德国统一的问题还没有解决。
    葛罗米柯继续说：关于改善欧洲形势和立即开始裁减四国军队的问题的意义。也是同样显而易见的。如果出席这次会议的英国和其他国家政府真正关心消除另一次战争的威胁和巩固和平的话，它们可以有机会用行动来表现这一点，并同意在四国外长会议中讨论关于裁减四国武装部队的问题。西方三个国家的政府对苏联这个提案的态度将表明：在改善欧洲的形势、缓和国际的紧张形势及改善苏联与参加这次会议的其他国家之间的关系这些问题上，它们的意图究竟严肃到什么程度。
    在葛罗米柯发言后，美国和法国代表建议休会。
    下次会议将于三月六日下午三时举行。
