　　The Beijing Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Organizes Basic-Level Party Organizations
    By our reporter, Pei Lan

    Editor's Note: The Beijing Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the method of voluntary registration of Party members as the first step in rectifying Party organizations. This is suitable for the organizational situation of the Party in Beijing. After liberation, the Party organization in Beijing expanded rapidly. A portion of the advanced elements among the masses were admitted into the Party before they could be educated in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Some of these Party members still have an unclear understanding of the nature of the Party and do not correctly understand the rights and obligations of Party members, which greatly limits the vanguard role of Party members in various tasks. In addition, individual class enemies also took the opportunity to infiltrate our Party. The registration method of the Fifth District is, in effect, a test for each Party member to see if they are truly determined to be a Party member and to be a good Party member. Those who are determined can register. Those who cannot withstand the test are free to withdraw from the Party. After registration, the Party will begin to rectify the organization.

    The Beijing Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began to rectify Party organizations on December 1st of last year. Based on the situation of the Party organizations in the Fifth District, they adopted the method of voluntary registration of Party members as the first step, and the results were very good.

    Before registration, the Beijing Fifth District Committee held short-term training classes for Party members to educate them on basic Party knowledge – the nature of the Party, the rights and obligations of Party members, the Party's mass line, etc. – and then registration was carried out. Participants in the Party member training classes included Party members from factories, industries, streets, and schools. Among them, apart from a dozen or so Party members who were underground Party members or transferred from rural areas, most were developed after the liberation of Beijing. The majority of these Party members are enthusiastic and responsible for the work of the Party, but their class consciousness is not high and their political level is still low. Some Party members still have a vague understanding of the nature of the Party. Some Party members in factories said: "The workers are the Party, and the Party is the workers!" Some Party members in schools believe that they are "students and Party members, learning is their own business, and working is the Party's business," requiring "consideration of both public and private interests" and serving the Party conditionally, without knowing that Party member learning is also for the benefit of the Party.

    In the process of carrying out basic Party knowledge education, the Fifth District first explained according to the ideological characteristics of Party members, and paid special attention to solving everyone's ideological problems through typical facts. For example, when discussing the mass line, the leadership style of a Party member cadre was discussed. Zhang Jingshan had few working methods, but he was unwilling to consult with the masses, so his work was not done well, and the masses had opinions. Each group launched a heated discussion based on this fact. This clarified that a good Party member should not only serve the people but also learn from the people. Zhang Zunyao, the secretary of the industry branch, said: "In the past, when I did work, I didn't consult with the masses. When the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement began last year, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions called for the establishment of reading groups among industrial workers. At that time, I was the director of the Fifth District Industry Federation Branch, so I decided on the organization method and newspaper subscription method for the reading groups according to my subjective wishes and asked everyone to follow it. As a result, only two groups were established, including mine. At that time, I knew there was something wrong, but I couldn't find the root cause. Now I've found it, because I didn't follow the mass line." Other comrades also used their own personal experiences to illustrate that work must follow the mass line. After such a heated discussion, Zhang Jingshan's thinking also suddenly became clear. He said: "Now I know the root cause of my problem, and I'll have a solution in the future. I'll consult with the masses when I encounter difficulties; if that doesn't work, I'll go to the branch, the district committee, the municipal committee, and finally, Chairman Mao!" Secondly, when lecturing, they also grasped the law of ideological struggle of Party members. First, they explained the nature of the Party, so that Party members first recognized that the Party is a political party of the working class, and then mobilized Party members to expose their own wrong understandings and launched discussions in groups.

    In the discussion, it was discovered that some Party members simply regarded the Party as the "Party of the poor." Underground Party member Tian Dongli thought when he joined the Party that the Party helped and led the peasants to turn over and distribute land in the countryside. After entering the city, it must also lead the urban poor to distribute houses. It was not until this time when he studied the nature of the Party that he realized that this idea was wrong. After the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a report on "Loyalty and Honesty" that a communist Party member should have towards the Party and the people, the Party members' thoughts began to struggle, and many people associated it with their historical problems or ideological problems. This report should be carried out after Party members have understood the basic conditions for being a Party member. Then talk about the mass line. In this way, the ideological struggle of Party members gradually intensified. By the time of registration, the ideological struggle reached its peak: "Should I be a Party member or not?" or "Do I have the conditions to be a Party member?" Every Party member was considering this.

    Before announcing the registration, the Fifth District also conducted a check on the ideological situation of Party members. The majority of Party members had a correct understanding of the Party and were determined to be Party members. However, there were also a few or individual Party members who still had some incorrect understandings. For example, some Party members said: "Being a Party member should only fulfill obligations and not enjoy rights," "Wherever the Party transfers me to work, I must obey, even if my children and wife starve to death," Although this is individual, necessary education and explanation work is still needed. The existence of these erroneous thoughts not only hinders his own progress, but also affects the ideological emotions of other Party members. When announcing the registration, the Fifth District Committee emphasized that registration is conscious and voluntary, and it is decided by the Party members themselves. There is no need to ask the branch for instructions or pull other Party members to register together. The Fifth District adopted the method of Party members going to the District Committee to talk and fill out forms. At the same time, it was also explained that Party members have the freedom to withdraw from the Party, which is clearly stipulated in the Party Constitution. This allows Party members to finally make up their minds to be a Party member and to be a good Party member.

    After fierce ideological struggles, many Party members decided to register with the Party and report their historical or ideological problems to the Party. Wang Hui, a typesetting worker at the Beijing Xinmin Daily Factory, joined the Party in 1949. When he joined the Party, he forgot to report to the Party that he had joined Yiguandao when he was thirteen years old. It was not until last December when the People's Government explicitly banned Yiguandao that he remembered that he had also joined Yiguandao. However, he still did not report to the Party at that time. On the one hand, he felt that he was still young when he joined the Tao, and he only kowtowed once a week, which was not a big deal. On the other hand, he was afraid that after telling the truth, the Party would not trust him because of this and would affect his Party membership. After this study of the nature of the Party, he finally realized that it was wrong not to report to the Party. Especially when listening to the report on "Loyalty and Honesty," when the report pointed out: "Some Party members often say that if the organization needs me, I can sacrifice my own interests, even my own life; but they actually conceal some problems in their history from the Party. Isn't this contradictory?" Wang Hui felt that this was clearly criticizing him! He asked himself: Is it loyal to the Party to conceal one's history from the Party? Does this behavior show that the Party does not trust him, or that he does not trust the Party? Afterwards, he said to others: "At that time, this series of questions seemed to hit my head like a hammer, smashing open my confused thoughts and waking me up from my sleep. I couldn't hold back any longer, I felt that concealing the Party in the past was disloyal and dishonest to the Party, and I wanted to report to the Party immediately." So he reported to the Party everything about his joining Yiguandao. The Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately pointed out to him that it was wrong to conceal historical problems from the Party in the past, and that it was good to be able to talk to the Party now. In the future, we must work hard to study in this regard. Wang Hui felt very happy. He also made a guarantee to the Party that he was determined to be loyal to the Party in the future and work honestly for the Party. Wang Jinzhen, a Party member of the Beijing First Women's Middle School, went to the Fifth District Committee to register after studying in the Party member training class without making an in-depth examination of her shortcomings and mistakes. The comrades of the Fifth District Committee asked her: Are you determined to be a Party member? What kind of Party member are you going to be? If you want to be a Party member, you must act in accordance with the Party Constitution. You should go back and think about it before registering. After she returned to school, she felt uneasy. She thought: "Everyone else's registration is very smooth, but my registration is so troublesome. There must be too many shortcomings, so I have to check carefully." Wang Jinzhen's individualism is more serious. When winter vacation began last year, the Party wanted to transfer her to work at the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but she emphasized that she was weak and unable to work and wanted to continue studying. When the Military Medical University was recruiting students, she asked the Party to allow her to apply, and the Party agreed. But when she learned that studying at the Military Medical University was not as satisfactory as she had imagined, she was unwilling to go. In this study, although she realized that she had individualistic ideas, her review was not very thorough. It was not until the Fifth District Committee made a suggestion that she began a fierce ideological struggle. She thought: "Whether I am determined to be a Party member is tonight, this is my big hurdle!" So she didn't sleep all night and re-read and studied the Party Constitution carefully. She thought that the Party Constitution clearly requires every Party member to serve the people wholeheartedly, but she is unwilling to give up her personal wishes for the benefit of the Party, so how can she be a Party member? Wang Jinzhen finally overcame her individualism. She was determined to correct these shortcomings and mistakes and be a good Party member.

    Even individual backward Party members who play no role at all have realized in their studies that they still lack the conditions to be a communist Party member. The Communist Party requires every Party member to unconditionally obey the interests of the Party and struggle to the end for the cause of communism, but they cannot do it. In order to maintain the purity of the Party, these people are determined to voluntarily withdraw from the Party. ××× is one of them. He joined the Party underground in this city in July 1948. At the beginning, he joined the Party entirely for his personal future. Therefore, after joining the Party, he was always unwilling to take on Party work and regarded participating in organizational life as a "burden." He was also unwilling to come to the Party member training class this time. After arriving at the training class, he behaved very passively. But when he saw other Party members carrying out ideological struggles, his thoughts also began to struggle, and he finally talked about the ideological problems that he had never talked about in the past. On the day before the announcement of the registration, he said to the branch secretary: "I'm not going to register! This time the Party has made it very clear that those who do not meet the conditions of a Party member and are not determined to be a Party member are free to withdraw from the Party. At the beginning, I joined the Communist Party because I was thinking about my personal future. Today I realize that being a communist Party member is glorious, but not just anyone can do it. There must be certain conditions, unlimited loyalty and honesty to the Communist Party, and the ability to struggle to the end for the cause of communism, but I am far from it. First of all, I cannot obey the organization's allocation of work and emphasize personal interests. There are also many other shortcomings. I don't have the courage to overcome these shortcomings all at once, so I decided not to stay in the Party. People like me will only cause losses to the Party if they stay in the Party, and will not do the Party any good." Speaking of this, he shed tears emotionally. Finally, he asked the Party to continue to help him make progress in the future, and hoped that he would have the opportunity to join the Party again in ten years. The branch secretary told him: "The Party Constitution stipulates that Party members have the freedom to withdraw from the Party, and the Party will continue to help you make progress in the future!" He was very happy.

    After registering, the Party members returned to their work or study positions and have begun to establish new working styles, unite the masses, and work hard. Party member Lu Shouchang, who served as the director of the Fifth District Tricycle Workers Cooperative, had poor relations with the masses before the study due to his undemocratic style, which also affected his work emotions. After returning from the study, he learned to follow the mass line and mastered the policy of running the cooperative well, making the cooperative very successful. The masses said enviously: "You have such a good opportunity to study." Zhou Jianqi, a political teacher at Shandong Middle School, took the initiative to find the principal to study the work after returning from the study. The principal felt that this had never happened before, so he asked the branch secretary: "How did you study in the Party member training class? You changed people in one winter vacation!" In the past, some people thought that Party members were "arrogant," but now they don't say that. Even some people who did not register and voluntarily withdrew from the Party have become more responsible for their work than in the past because they received the Party's education and the Party's continuous help. Some of them also often conduct self-criticism, solicit the opinions of Party members, and express to the Party again and again that they want to strive to be a Party member.

　　中共北京第五区委员会
    整理党的基层组织
    本报记者  培蓝
    编者按：中共北京市第五区委员会在整顿党组织中第一步采用党员自愿登记的方法。这是适合北京市党的组织情况的。北京市的党组织在解放后，曾因大量发展，有一部分群众中的先进分子，来不及经过党的马克思、列宁主义与毛泽东思想教育，便被吸收入党了。其中有些党员至今对党的性质认识不清，对党员的权利与义务了解不正确，这就大大限制了党员在各种工作中的先锋作用。另外还有个别阶级异己分子也乘机混入我们党内。五区的登记方法，实际上就是考验每个党员，是否真正有决心作一个党员，并且作一个好党员。有决心的人就可去登记。经不起考验的人，可以自由退党。登记后，党即开始整顿组织。
    中共北京市第五区委员会，从去年十二月一日开始，就着手整顿党的组织。他们根据五区党组织的情况，第一步采用了党员自愿登记的方法，效果很好。
    在登记之前，北京市第五区委员会开办了党员短期训练班，先对党员进行了党的基本知识教育——党的性质、党员的权利与义务、党的群众路线等，然后再进行登记。参加党员训练班学习的，有来自工厂、行业、街道和学校的党员，其中除十几个党员是地下党及由农村转来的外，大都是北京解放后发展的。其中大多数党员对党的工作是热情负责的，但阶级觉悟不高，政治水平也还低，有部分党员至今对党的性质认识还很模糊。有些工厂党员说：“工人就是党，党就是工人！”有些学校党员认为自己是“学生兼党员，学习是自己的，工作是党的”，要求“公私兼顾”，有条件地为党服务，而不知道党员学习也是为了党的利益。
    在进行党的基本知识教育过程中，五区首先根据党员的思想特点来进行讲解，并特别注意通过典型事实来解决大家的思想问题。例如讲群众路线时，就讨论了一个党员干部的领导作风。张景山工作办法少，但他又不愿和群众商量，因此工作作得不太好，群众有意见。各组根据这一事实即展开了热烈的讨论。这就明确了解了一个好党员，不但要为人民服务，而且要向人民学习。行业支部书记张尊尧说：“过去我作工作，就不和群众商量。去年抗美援朝运动开始时，北京市总工会号召在行业工人中成立读报小组，当时我是五区行业工会分会主任，就按照主观愿望，决定了读报组的组织方法和订报的方法，叫大家照办。结果连我在内，才成立了两个小组。当时我知道这有毛病，可是找不着根。这下可找着了，就因为我不会走群众路线。”其他同志也都用自己的亲身经验，说明了作工作必须走群众路线。经过这样热烈的讨论，张景山的思想也豁然开朗，他说：“这会可知道我的病根了，以后就有办法了，遇到困难就和群众商量；再不成，找支部，找区委、市委，最后还有毛主席！”其次，在讲课时，还掌握了党员的思想斗争规律，首先讲解党的性质，使党员先认识党是一个工人阶级的政党，然后发动党员揭发自己的错误认识，在小组中展开讨论。
    在讨论中，发现了有些党员简单地把党当作“穷人党”。地下党员田东立，入党时就想，党在农村帮助与领导农民翻身分土地，进城后，一定也要领导城市穷人分房子。直到这次学习党的性质后，才知道这种想法是错误的。中共区委会在作了一个共产党员应当对党对人民《忠诚与老实》的报告后，党员的思想开始斗争，许多人联想到自己的历史问题，或思想问题。这个报告，应在党员已经了解作一个党员的起码条件之后进行。接着再讲群众路线。这样党员的思想斗争逐渐紧张。到登记时，思想斗争达到了最高峰：“究竟当不当党员？”或者“有没有当党员的条件？”每个党员都在这样考虑着。
    五区在宣布登记前，还对党员的思想情况进行了一次检查，大多数党员对党有了正确认识，并有决心作一个党员。但是也有少数或个别党员还有一些错误的认识。例如有的党员说：“当党员只应尽义务，不应享权利”，“党调我到那里工作，只有服从，孩子老婆饿死也不管”，这虽然是个别的，但是还需进行必要的教育解释工作。这些错误思想存在不仅阻碍他本人的进步，并会影响其他党员的思想情绪。在宣布登记时，五区委员会着重说明了登记是自觉自愿的，由党员自己决定，不必请示支部，或拉其他党员一同登记。登记时五区采用了党员个人自动到区委会谈话填表的方式。同时还说明党员有退党的自由，这是党章已明确规定了的。这样使党员最后下决心作一个党员，作一个好党员。
    许多党员经过激烈的思想斗争之后，决心向党登记，并向党报告自己的历史问题或思想问题。北京新民报工厂排字工人汪慧，一九四九年参加党的，入党时把他十三岁时加入一贯道的事情忘了向党报告，直到去年十二月人民政府明令取缔一贯道时，他才想起自己也加入过一贯道。可是当时他仍没有向党报告。一方面他认为入道时年龄还小，只是每礼拜磕一次头，没有多大关系；另一方面，怕说出来后，党因此不信任他，并影响到他的党籍问题。这次学习后，终于认识了不向党报告是错误的，特别是在听《忠诚与老实》的报告时，当报告中指出：“有些党员常说，假如组织需要我的时候，我能牺牲自己的利益，甚至牺牲个人的生命；但是对自己历史上的一些问题，竟然对党隐瞒。这不是很矛盾吗？”汪慧感到这明明是批评他呀！他反问自己：对党隐瞒自己历史是忠诚吗？这种行为说明了党不信任自己呢，还是自己不信任党呢？他过后对人说：“当时这一连串问题，好像铁锤一般地砸在我的头上，把我的糊涂思想砸开了，把我从昏睡中砸醒了。我再也蹩不住了，我感到过去隐瞒了党，就是对党不忠诚不老实，我要立即向党报告。”于是就把他加入一贯道的事情，全部向党报告了。中共五区委员会当即给他指出过去对党隐瞒历史问题是错误的，现在能够向党谈出来是好的。以后要在这方面好好努力学习。汪慧感到非常愉快。他并向党提出保证，今后决心忠实于党，为党老实地工作。北京市立第一女子中学党员王瑾妍在党员训练班学习后，对自己的缺点、错误还没作深入的检查，就到五区委员会去登记。五区委员会的同志问她：你是不是有决心作一个党员？你准备作一个什么样的党员？要作一个党员，就得按党章办事。你应该回去想一想再来登记。她回学校后，心就不安起来。她想：“人家去登记都很顺利，就我去登记那么麻烦，一定是自己缺点太多，这要好好检查。”王瑾妍的个人主义较严重。去年放寒假时，党要调她到中共北京市委员会去工作，但她强调自己能力弱，作不了工作，要继续学习。当军医大学招生时，她要求党准许她去投考，党也同意了。但当她知道去军医大学学习，并非如她自己所想像的那样称心如意时，她又不愿去了。在这次学习中，她虽然认识了自己有个人主义思想，但检讨得不很深刻，直到五区委员会提出意见后，她才开始了激烈的思想斗争。她想：“自己有没有决心当一个党员，就在今天晚上，这是我的一大关！”于是她一夜没有睡觉，重新仔细阅读研究了党章。她想党章上明明要求每个党员全心全意为人民服务，但自己却不肯为了党的利益放弃个人的意愿，这怎么能当一个党员呢？王瑾妍最后终于战胜了自己的个人主义。她决心要改正这些缺点与错误，当一个好党员。
    就是个别根本不起作用的落后党员，在学习中也认识了自己还缺乏条件来作一个共产党员。共产党要求每个党员无条件地服从党的利益，为共产主义事业奋斗到底，但自己作不到。为着保持党的纯洁，这些人决心自动退党。×××就是其中一个。他是一九四八年七月在本市地下参加党的。当初入党完全为了个人前途着想，因此入党后，一直不愿担任党的工作，把过组织生活当成“负担”。这次也不愿来党员训练班学习。到训练班后，他又表现得很消沉。但当他看到其他党员进行思想斗争时，他的思想也开始斗争起来，终于把他过去从来不曾谈的思想问题，谈出来了。在宣布登记的前一天，他对支部书记说：“我不去登记了！这次党已讲得很清楚，不够党员条件的，又没有决心当一个党员的，可以自由退党。当初我参加共产党，确实是为了个人前途着想。今天我认识了，作一个共产党员是光荣的，但并不是任何人都可以作的，必须有一定的条件，对共产党无限的忠诚与老实，能为共产主义事业奋斗到底，可是我差得太远了。我首先在工作上不能服从组织分配，强调个人兴趣。其他缺点也很多。这些我又没有勇气一下子克服了，所以我决定不再留在党内。像我这样的人，留在党内只会给党造成损失，不会对党有任何好处。”说到这里他感情激动地流下了眼泪。最后他要求党今后仍能很好帮助他进步，并希望十年之后，还有机会入党。支部书记就告诉他：“党章规定，党员有退党自由，党今后还会继续帮助你进步！”他很高兴。
    经过登记后的党员，回到自己工作或学习岗位上，已开始树立起新的工作作风，团结群众，努力工作。党员吕寿臣，担任五区三轮工人合作社主任，学习前因作风不民主，和群众关系搞得不好，同时又影响了自己的工作情绪。学习回去后，学会了走群众路线，又掌握了办好合作社的方针，把合作社办得很好。群众羡慕地说：“你就有这么好的机会学习。”山东中学政治教员周建奇，学习回去后，主动找校长研究工作。校长感到这是从来没有的事情，就问支部书记道：“你们在党员训练班怎么学习的，一个寒假就把人变了样子！”过去有些群众认为党员“党气凌人”的，现在都不这样说了。就是一些没有登记自动退党的人，也因为在这次受到了党的教育和党对他们不断地帮助，他们对工作也比过去负责了。有的还常常进行自我检讨，征求党员的意见，三番五次向党表示，要为作一个党员而奋斗。
