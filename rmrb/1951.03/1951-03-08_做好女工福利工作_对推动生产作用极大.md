Doing a Good Job in Women Workers' Welfare Work
    Greatly Promotes Production

In the past year, women workers' welfare work in factories across the country has been initially launched. Factories that have done a good job in women workers' welfare have played a significant role in boosting the production enthusiasm of women workers, and therefore production performance has continued to increase.

According to statistics from twenty-nine cities in the six major administrative regions of the country, public and private factories have established a total of 286 nurseries and lactation rooms, accommodating more than 11,900 children. Due to the increase in the number of nurseries, the work efficiency of women workers has also improved.

Caring for pregnant women workers is an important issue in factory women workers' welfare work. Generally, larger state-owned factories in various regions, such as spinning mills in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Lüda, have established and implemented regulations regarding maternity leave benefits for pregnant women workers. Some factories in Shenyang, Harbin, Shanxi, and other places also stipulate that women workers who are more than seven months pregnant should not work night shifts or do overtime, and should be given the convenience of changing to suitable work when necessary. Shanghai State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 8 has also established a mutual assistance pact for caring for pregnant women workers.

Factories in various regions have paid attention to and improved women workers' labor conditions, safety and hygiene equipment, and maternal and child health education. In May of last year, some factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Northeast China organized medical personnel to conduct physical examinations for women workers to initially understand their health conditions. Shanghai established a Factory Maternal and Child Health Propaganda and Education Work Committee. Beijing and Tianjin organized factory maternal and child health and childcare work research groups. Harbin's factories held 28 health lectures throughout the year.

In the past year, although the welfare work for women workers in factories across the country has achieved certain results, the development and depth of this work are far from meeting the objective needs of women workers nationwide. According to surveys, occupational diseases, gynecological diseases, and lung diseases are still serious problems among women workers in various regions. Most of the medical equipment in factories in various regions is also simple, and there is a particular lack of specialized gynecologists. Some factories have neglected the special physiological conditions of pregnant women workers in production competitions and rush work, which has also caused adverse effects. All these situations must be changed.

　　做好女工福利工作
    对推动生产作用极大
    一年来各地工厂女工福利工作已初步展开。凡是女工福利工作做得好的工厂，对提高女工们的生产情绪都起了重大作用，因此生产成绩也不断增高。
    根据全国六大行政区二十九个城市的统计，公私营工厂共设有托儿所、哺乳室二百八十六处，受托儿童一万一千九百多名。由于托儿所数量的增加，女工们的工作效率也随着提高。
    对怀孕女工的照顾，是工厂女工福利工作中的一个重要问题。各地一般较大的公营工厂，如天津、上海、青岛、旅大等地的纺纱厂，大都订立并执行了怀孕女工生产假期待遇的规定。沈阳、哈尔滨、山西等地的某些工厂并规定：怀孕七个月以上的女工不作夜班，不加工，必要时并给予调换适当工作的方便。上海国营棉纺织第八厂，并订立了照顾怀孕女工的互助公约。
    各地工厂在女工的劳动条件上，安全卫生设备上和妇婴卫生教育上，都有了注意和改进。去年五月，上海、天津、青岛及东北的一部分工厂，组织了医务人员为女工检查身体，初步了解了女工的健康情况。上海成立了工厂妇婴卫生宣传教育工作委员会。北京、天津组织了工厂妇婴卫生、儿童保育工作研究小组。哈尔滨各工厂一年中举行了二十八次卫生讲座。
    一年来，各地工厂女工的福利工作，虽然有了一定的成绩；但，这一工作的开展和深入远不及全国女工的客观需要。据调查，各地女工中还严重地存在着职业病、妇科病和肺病等。各地工厂的医药设备也是简陋的居多，尤其缺乏妇科病的专门医师。有的工厂在生产竞赛和突击工作中忽视了怀孕女工的特殊生理情况，也造成了不良的影响。这些情况都必须加以改变。
