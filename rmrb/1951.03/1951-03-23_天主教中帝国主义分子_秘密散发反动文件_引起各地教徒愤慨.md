Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd. Catholic believers in the Chongqing and Ya'an dioceses have expressed great indignation towards the activities of imperialist elements within the Catholic Church who are secretly distributing reactionary documents to undermine the patriotic self-governance and renovation movement of patriotic believers. Shi Mingliang, Bishop of the Chongqing Diocese, and believers such as Chen Guangfu, have made statements strongly condemning these despicable destructive acts by imperialist elements, and expressed their determination to overcome all obstacles and continue to promote the renovation movement. The preparatory committee of the Chongqing Catholic Believers' Study Group also issued a statement refuting the distortion and slander of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement by imperialist elements. The statement pointed out that the Three-Self Patriotic Movement promoted by Catholics is a self-reliant patriotic movement that inspires believers' patriotic and religious zeal and severs all ties with imperialism. Its purpose is precisely to protect the purity of Catholicism and freedom of belief. Every patriotic Catholic should unite, heighten vigilance, and fight to the end against the obstruction and sabotage of imperialist elements.

The Ya'an Catholic Renovation Committee of Xikang Province also issued a declaration stating that more than 1,300 believers in the Ya'an Diocese, under the leadership of the People's Government, have stood up and will never fear any intimidation from imperialist elements, nor will they be deceived by them. They will resolutely stand on the patriotic and religious stance, thoroughly sever all ties with imperialism in terms of organization, economy, and ideology, and carry out the renovation movement more deeply. The declaration also called on Catholics in various regions to adopt a firm attitude, expose and eliminate imperialist saboteurs hidden within the church, and never allow the Chinese Catholic Church to be used as a tool for imperialist aggression against China again.
