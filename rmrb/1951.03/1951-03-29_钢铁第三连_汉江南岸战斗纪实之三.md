The Steel Third Company
    — A Chronicle of the Battle on the South Bank of the Han River, Part 3
    By Our Correspondent Chao Qi
    In late January, on the front stretching over two hundred li from Suwon to Hoengseong, MacArthur launched a desperate offensive against our beachhead positions on the south bank of the Han River with a force of 230,000 men. At that time, the fighting on the south bank of the Han River was unprecedentedly fierce. Those who have read Simonov's novel "Days and Nights" were amazed by the greatness of the Battle of Stalingrad. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers liked to compare the defense of the south bank of the Han River with the Battle of Stalingrad. This is not an exaggeration, because we were using rifles, grenades, and machine guns to fight against the most ferocious enemy of the world's people, who outnumbered us several times over and were engaged in joint operations with various arms of service. On every inch of the position, the Chinese People's Volunteers wrote a moving chapter for the peace and happiness of mankind through heroic and resourceful fighting. This is a heroic achievement that people will never forget!
                ×                ×                ×
    February 12th was the nineteenth day of the enemy's offensive. In these nineteen days, the Chinese People's Volunteers had repelled countless enemy attacks. Before the Third Company of a certain battalion accepted the task of defending the 353 Height south of Seolwol-ri near Gyeongan-ri, the enemy had occupied the 276.8 Height in the southeast at a heavy price. The 353 Height was a horseshoe-shaped position, protruding like an iron fist in front of the enemy. At this time, the task of defending this position was particularly arduous. Battalion commander Cao Yuhai had long predicted that the enemy would not accept defeat and that there would be an unprecedented fierce battle on February 12th. The battalion commander's judgment was correct. On this day, the 5th and 7th Regiments of the US 1st Cavalry Division, and part of the 24th Division, with the cooperation of 52 tanks, 24 aircraft, more than 40 howitzers and recoilless guns, launched eight fierce assaults on this position. The machine guns on the enemy tanks were so dense that the longest time that machine gun fire was interrupted in the six hours from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. was only eight minutes.
    Company Commander Zhao Lianshan accepted this arduous and glorious task with full confidence. "I only have forty-five men and one gun," he thought, "if we were attacking the enemy, it wouldn't matter if there were fewer people, but now we are defending." Defense is not as flexible as offense. His company was best at attacking. A few nights ago, he twice personally led a squad into the enemy's rear to destroy bridges, killing and capturing three enemies, seizing an automatic rifle and a carbine each, and destroying a jeep. For this achievement, he was commended by the high command. Defense is more difficult than offense; the enemy's artillery fire is like a machine gun, often destroying the entire hilltop; gasoline bombs and incendiary bombs burn the grass and trees and scorch the soil. If the forces are not properly deployed, even more troops will be quickly wiped out by artillery and aircraft. Zhao Lianshan was a good commander; a good commander needs not only to be brave and tenacious, but also smart and resourceful. From the Yalu River to the Han River, he knew that the morale of the US military was declining and their charge was the worst. As long as they could defend against the enemy's aircraft and artillery, they could deal with even more enemy infantry. Therefore, after discussing with the battalion commander, he led the soldiers to build very ingenious fortifications.
    When the company commander returned from the battalion command post after reporting on the deployment of troops, the sun had already climbed up the hillside, the enemy's first volley of artillery had stopped, and the flames caused by gasoline bombs and incendiary bombs were still burning. Fifty-two tanks, each forming a bunker of three tanks, were arranged along the foot of the mountains on the east, west, and south sides. On the highway to Gyeongan-ri, enemy vehicles were speeding by, kicking up clouds of yellow dust. The timid enemies were then drinking whiskey in groups of three or five to numb their nerves and reduce their fear of death.
    This was a special calm before the counterattack. The soldiers gripped their guns tightly and quietly listened to the company commander telling about the glorious achievements since going abroad to fight: "Our company annihilated the Turkish Brigade in the Second Campaign; on the night of breaking through the 38th parallel, the company commander was wounded, and squad leader Li Shulin led six men to capture a high mountain defended by a company of enemies. Our cooks are also brave; they once captured more than twenty American soldiers alive. Our troops have been hailed as 'Long Live' by the people. These are all honors created by the comrades with blood and lives. Today—February 12, 1951, we must never tarnish our past honors in Seolwol-ri. We must create new honors..." The soldiers are the creators of honor; they know the price of obtaining honor, and they cherish honor more than their own lives. The company commander's words were like a raging fire, burning the soldiers' bloodlust to kill the enemy.
    Before the company commander could finish speaking, Tang Fuwen, who was monitoring the enemy, came in and reported: the enemy has begun to charge. The soldiers shouted the slogan "A new opportunity to perform meritorious service for the Chinese and Korean people has come!" and rushed to the position like a group of fierce tigers coming out of the mountains, preparing to counterattack the enemy. Only a dozen enemies charged this time. There was no need to use rifles and grenades to deal with such a small number of enemies, let alone machine guns. On the battlefield, it is very valuable to save one more person and one more bullet. The company commander ordered everyone to return to the bunker and then told the deputy squad leader of the eighth squad, Fu Guoliang, to fire the gun. Fu Guoliang was a good gunner. When he annihilated the Turkish Brigade at Yang Station, he observed the point of impact and measured the distance on the ridge in the face of the enemy's fiercest fire, and then fired with confidence. The first shot destroyed an enemy heavy machine gun, killing five enemies; the second shot destroyed a recoilless gun and a light machine gun, enabling our attacking troops to successfully occupy the position. Now, it was time for Fu Guoliang to show his skills again. He fired five shots in a row and wiped out the enemy.
    About ten minutes later, the enemy fired artillery. This was the prelude to the second charge. More than forty recoilless guns and howitzers fired simultaneously from Gyeongan-ri, Tun-ri, and Ssangnyeong-ri. The shells fell like a rainstorm, and yellow-orange smoke and dust shrouded the position, making it impossible to see people more than three steps away. After the artillery fire, nearly thirty enemies charged up, chattering. Like the first time, the enemies were so timid that only Fu Guoliang's gun drove them back again.
    The enemy was confused. Both charges were driven back by one gun. They thought that there was no one else on the position except a gunner. So, without firing artillery, they launched the third charge. This time, the enemies seemed to be a little smarter, advancing in three directions at the same time, with twice as many people as last time. The Third Company deployed two platoons of the first squad on the position to counterattack. One platoon was responsible for fighting one route, and Fu Guoliang used a gun to fight one route. When the enemies charged to the middle of the mountain, guns and grenades fired together, and with a series of more than a dozen explosions, dozens of enemies fell down at the same time, and the rest hugged their heads and rolled down quickly like wooden stakes.
    The enemy launched the fourth charge. The enemy wanted to win by numbers, and the number of people charging increased each time. This time, they still charged in three directions, with an uncountable number of people. Squad leader Liu Zhanqing of the first squad, looking down from the sentry post at the commanding height, saw that they were as black as a pack of wolves. The situation was serious. Facing so many enemies, the company commander thought: "It is impossible to counterattack from the front alone." After discussing with the instructor, he decided to counterattack in two directions. The instructor led the second platoon, which served as a reserve team, to counterattack from the left flank; the company commander led the first and third platoons to counterattack from the front. The enemies were already drunk and charged wildly. At this time, the soldiers of the Third Company were particularly calm. After each grenade was thrown, it could be seen that there was a gap in the enemy group where the dust splashed. After the enemies were fatally counterattacked, they seemed to wake up from a big dream and collapsed one after another.
    The battle entered the most heroic stage. After the enemies' four charges were all miserably defeated, they went crazy. They not only wanted to occupy this position but also wanted to destroy it before occupying it.
    The enemy began the third artillery barrage. This artillery barrage was unprecedentedly vicious. In addition to more than forty howitzers and recoilless guns, the flat-firing guns on fifty-two tanks, and countless mortars all fired together. Aircraft dived down from all directions like a pack of mad dogs, dropping gasoline bombs and incendiary bombs, firing rockets, artillery, and strafing. In short, all destructive weapons were used. For a whole hour, the mountains and the earth collapsed, the position became a sea of fire, no grass or trees were complete, and even rocks as big as kerosene tanks were shattered. Yellow soil was intertwined with flames, and it was difficult to see people's faces even in the daytime.
    The position was burning. Under the cover of dozens of machine guns, the enemies began to charge frantically one after another. At this time, it was impossible to distinguish where the front was and where the side was on the position. The enemies climbed up from all directions. Our soldiers fought with the enemies, who were ten times larger than themselves, in the sea of fire. The enemy counterattacked wherever they came up first. Company Commander Zhao said when talking about the situation of the battle at that time: "After throwing grenades at the enemies coming from the east, immediately turned around and used automatic rifles to shoot at the enemies coming from the west."
    Those enemies who dared to charge only after getting drunk and numbing their nerves always had low morale, no matter how many they were. But our morale was getting higher and higher. On this day, no officer or soldier went down the line with minor injuries. Squad leader of the eighth squad, communist party member Shen De'en, was injured in his left eye during the first counterattack. The company commander told him to go down, but he said: "It doesn't matter, I still have my right eye to aim with. As long as my hand doesn't break, I will stick to the end." He did not return to the rear until his right arm and leg were injured. Squad leader Tu Jin of the first squad was also a communist party member. During the Yang Station battle, he made a great contribution by charging the enemy position alone and occupying the hilltop. In this day's battle, his left ear was injured, and his face was covered in blood, like a blood man. The company commander persuaded him to go down, but he refused, and he became more and more brave, and finally even stood up to fight, until a bullet hit his forehead and he died gloriously. He is immortal. There was also the nineteen-year-old Wang Qichun, who requested to join the party at the front line during the most intense battle. Heroes like Shen De'en, Tu Jin, and Wang Qichun are countless in the Chinese People's Volunteers. Especially the Third Company, we can say that all forty-five people who participated in this battle were heroes. The heroes finally defeated the enemy's seventh charge.
    The sun was setting in the west, and it was almost three o'clock. The planes were far away, and the sound of guns was intermittent. This was a moment of silence after a fight and before another fight. There were now five people left on the Third Company position. There were no more grenades, and each person had only three or a few bullets. The soldiers talked and talked while putting out the fire on their cotton clothes. Then, they used propaganda paper dropped by American planes to roll cigarettes and smoke. The soldiers took a hard puff and slowly exhaled. The white smoke fluttered in the clear sky. At this time, at the foot of the mountain, the Americans were drinking. A woman who called herself a "Beijinger" was broadcasting shameless and futile broadcasts in Chinese in a tank. She shouted: "Chinese, surrender!" The soldiers were extremely angry and cursed fiercely: "Shameless woman, surrender to your mother's ass!" On the highway, dozens of vehicles were full of living "cannon fodder" coming from Gyeongan-ri, and full of wounded "cannon fodder" going back.
    The company commander estimated that there would be another battle that day and told the comrades to prepare to counterattack. Sure enough, the eighth counterattack really came. Like the previous few times, under the cover of fierce fire, the enemies charged up from all directions. This was a battle of life and death. Although the enemy's ferocity was quickly suppressed, when the battle was still going on, only the company commander and Liu Zhanqing were left on the position. Liu Zhanqing had three bullets left, and the company commander only had four bullets left in his box gun. At this time, the company commander's mood was more complicated. What he was considering was not the question of life and death; he was not afraid of death and had long made up his mind to "coexist with the position." What he was considering was Comrade Fang Xin, the battalion instructor. Comrade Fang Xin was only twenty-seven years old this year and was a model instructor. Since this battalion took on the defense mission, he, like the battalion commander, had not slept for five days and five nights. Since the battalion commander was killed in the morning, he had been commanding the battle in the battalion command post. A sense of love for comrades and a sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause drove Zhao Lianshan, forcing him to persuade the instructor to leave the command post before the final battle.
    "Comrade Instructor! Please leave quickly! We are going to have the final battle!" Zhao Lianshan wanted to persuade the instructor in a sincere voice. But the instructor had also made up his mind to "coexist with the position." He had burned all the documents last night! Now, he was sitting quietly next to the telephone in the shelter. Zhao Lianshan's heartfelt advice made him sad. He knew that at this moment, saying his decision would make Zhao Lianshan sad. He simply did not answer, as if he had not heard it. Until the end, he led the two communicators and one telephone operator of the battalion command post to counterattack the enemy, and died gloriously in the counterattack.
    While Zhao Lianshan was calling the instructor, four enemies charged up. These four enemies did not fire their guns. It looked like they wanted to capture someone alive. They were really daydreaming. Zhao Lianshan took out the four most precious bullets from the box gun. As soon as they were fired, three enemies fell down in response. The remaining enemy picked up a carbine and fired. That guy was unlucky, the carbine didn't fire. That guy jumped over and used the butt of the gun to hit Zhao Lianshan's neck hard, knocking him down. A courage to fight for life and death supported Zhao Lianshan, causing him to stand up quickly and use all his strength to hit that guy's head with the butt of the box gun, causing him to let out a wail, hug his head, and roll down the mountain. Zhao Lianshan himself also fainted on the position.
    After Liu Zhanqing saw the company commander fainting, he ran over and dragged him down the mountain.
    They came to the dressing station. There were five other seriously wounded soldiers there, as well as battalion communicator Wang Qingshan, who was left over when he and the instructor made the final counterattack against the enemy. Zhao Lianshan woke up from his coma. Wang Qingshan told him about the instructor's sacrifice, and he felt very sad. What was not allowed to be thought about on the battlefield, but in this short moment, the things that had made him unforgettable for twenty-five years came to his mind. He was thinking about his past. At the age of nine, he helped the landlord with work, was scolded and beaten, until after the Japanese surrendered, he joined the Eighth Route Army. Now, his family had been allocated land, had food and clothing, and he had also married a wife. When the Americans fought to the Yalu River, Zhao Lianshan joined the Chinese People's Volunteers. Before going abroad, his lover came to see him off at Kaiyuan Station. Before leaving, the two also made a competition agreement: she would strive to be a production model at home and strive to join the party; he promised to strive to be a hero in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. "What kind of hero is the result of defending the position today?" he asked himself. He thought of his company, of Tu Jin who had sacrificed, of the instructor who had been wounded, of Fu Guoliang, Wang Qichun..., and finally of the instructor and the battalion commander, especially the battalion commander. He still clearly remembered the last conversation he had with the battalion commander this morning in the battalion command post. At that time, after the battalion commander handed him the task of defending the 353 Height, he said to him: "Company Commander Zhao, Cao Cao's soldiers retreated eighty li, I hope you don't bring Cao Cao's soldiers." He also assured the battalion commander in a firm tone: "Please rest assured, I will definitely not bring Cao Cao's soldiers. The people are on the position." Now, the bodies of the two leaders have not been carried down... Everything he thought about seemed to be calling him to fight. He was extremely sad and got up to run up the mountain. The seriously wounded asked him where he was going. He said: "What are you going up there for! I still want to fight the enemy!" Liu Zhanqing and the seriously wounded hugged his legs and refused to let him go. The seriously wounded Liang Zhongxin cried and said: "Company commander, there are no more ammunition, aren't you going up there to be captured? If you go up, we will all go up. In order to defeat US imperialism, we will live and die together!" Everyone was moved to tears. This kind of tears is not a sign of cowardice, but is full of the brilliance of avenging and killing the enemy. Now, I am seeing Zhao Lianshan reorganizing his forces again at the front to continue resisting the enemy.
                                    February 19th, on the Han River front

　　钢铁第三连
    ——汉江南岸战斗纪实之三
    本报记者  超祺
    一月下旬，在水原至横城东西二百余里的正面上，麦克阿瑟以二十三万人的兵力，向我汉江南岸的滩头阵地发起拼死的进攻。那时候，汉江南岸的战斗是空前的激烈。读过西蒙诺夫的小说《日日夜夜》的人，都曾惊叹斯大林格勒保卫战的伟大。中国人民志愿军的战士们，很喜欢把汉江南岸的阻击战与斯大林格勒保卫战相比拟。这不是妄自夸大，因为我们是以步枪、手榴弹和机关枪抗击世界人民最凶恶的敌人，他们在人数上数倍于我们，而且是各种兵种联合作战。我国人民志愿军在每一寸阵地上，用英勇而机智的战斗，为人类的和平与幸福写下了可歌可泣的篇章。这是人们永远不能忘记的英雄业绩！
                ×                ×                ×
    二月十二日，是敌人发动攻势的第十九天。在这十九天里，我国人民志愿军曾打退了敌人无数次的攻击。某部一营的第三连接受防守京安里附近雪月里南三五三高地的任务前，敌人已以惨重的代价占领了东南面的二七六点八高地。三五三高地是一座马蹄形的阵地，像铁拳一样突出在敌人的面前。在这个时候，守备这个阵地的任务是特别艰巨的。营指挥员曹玉海早就预言，敌人不甘失败，二月十二日必有一场空前的激战。营指挥员的判断没有错。这一天，美军骑一师的五团和七团，还有二十四师的一部，在五十二辆坦克、二十四架飞机、四十余门榴弹炮和无座力炮的配合下，对这个阵地进行了八次猛烈的冲锋。敌人坦克上的机枪密集到这样的程度：从上午九时到下午三时的六小时内，机枪中断射击的时间，最长的仅八分钟。
    连长赵连山满怀着信心接受了这个艰巨而光荣的任务。“我只有四十五个人，一门炮，”他想道，“要是出击敌人的话，人再少一点也没啥问题，但现在是防守。”防守没有出击灵活。他的连队最善于出击。前几天的一个夜晚，他曾两次亲率一班人摸入敌后破坏桥梁，毙俘敌人三个，缴获自动步枪和卡宾枪各一枝，毁坏吉普车一辆。由于这一功绩，他曾获得高级司令部的明令表扬。防守比出击艰苦，敌人的排炮像机关枪一样，常常毁坏整个山头；汽油弹、燃烧弹把草木烧光，把泥土烧焦。要是不好好的布置兵力，有再多的兵员也会很快地被大炮和飞机消灭的。赵连山是个好指挥员，一个好指挥员不仅需要勇敢顽强，而且还需要聪明机智。从鸭绿江打到汉江，他知道美军的士气消沉，冲锋劲最差，只要能防御住敌人的飞机和大炮，敌人的步兵再多些也有法子治他们。因此，他和营指挥员研究后，领导战士作了非常巧妙的工事。
    连长从营指挥所报告兵力布置情况回来时，太阳已爬上山岗，敌人第一次排炮已停止，汽油弹、烧夷弹引起的火焰还在燃烧。五十二辆坦克，每三辆构成一个地堡，沿着东、西、南三面山脚摆开了。通京安里的公路上，敌汽车在奔驰，扬起一股股黄色的尘土。胆怯的敌人，这时正在三五成群地喝着威士忌酒来麻痹自己的神经，以减少对死亡的恐怖。
    这是反击前特殊的宁静。战士们紧握着枪，静静地倾听着连长讲述出国作战以来的光辉战绩：“我们的连队在第二次战役中，追歼了土耳其旅；在突破三八线的那个晚上，连长负伤了，李树林班长领导六个人，仍能攻占有一连敌人防守的一座高山。我们的炊事员也是勇敢的，他们曾经活捉过二十多个美国兵。我们的部队曾经被人们欢呼“万岁”。这些都是同志们用鲜血和生命创造出来的荣誉。今天——一九五一年二月十二日，我们绝不能在雪月里玷污我们过去的荣誉。我们要创造新的荣誉……”战士们就是荣誉的创造者，他们知道获得荣誉的代价，他们珍惜荣誉甚于自己的生命。连长的话像一团烈火，把战士们杀敌的热血烧得混身沸腾。
    连长的话没有说完，监视敌人的唐富文走进来报告：敌人开始冲锋了。战士们高呼：“为中朝人民立功的新机会又来了！”的口号，像一群出山的猛虎，一股儿冲到阵地上，准备反击敌人。这一次冲上来的敌人只有十几个。对付这么点敌人用不着步枪和手榴弹，更用不着机关枪。在战场上，多节省一个人和一粒子弹是十分可贵的。连长让所有的人统统回到地堡里去，然后叫八班副傅国良打炮。傅国良是一个好炮手，他在杨站追歼土耳其旅时，冒着敌人最猛烈的火力，在棱线上观察弹着点，测量距离，然后十拿九稳地发炮。第一发，摧毁敌人一挺重机枪，击毙五个敌人；第二发，摧毁一门无座力炮和一挺轻机枪，使我进攻部队顺利地攻占阵地。现在，又是傅国良大显身手的时候了。他连发五炮，就把敌人打掉了。
    约十来分钟后，敌人发射排炮。这是第二次冲锋的序幕。四十余门无座力炮和榴弹炮，同时由京安里、屯里和双岭里射来。炮弹像骤雨一样落下来，黄橙橙的烟尘笼罩着阵地，三步之外便看不见人。排炮之后，将近三十个敌人呱哩呱啦地冲了上来。像第一次那样，敌人是多么胆怯，仅仅傅国良的炮又把他们打下去了。
    敌人被迷惑住了。两次冲锋，都被一门炮打回去。他们以为阵地上除了一个炮手外，再没有别的人了。于是，没有发排炮，就发动第三次冲锋。这一次，敌人似乎聪明了一些，分三路并进，人数比上一次多一倍。三连把一排的两个班布置在阵地上反击。一个班负责打一路，傅国良用炮打一路。当敌人冲到半山时，炮和手榴弹一齐发，轰隆隆一连十几响，三十几个敌人同声栽倒，剩下来的，抱着头，像木桩一样，迅速地滚下去了。
    敌人又发动第四次冲锋。敌人想以人数来取得胜利，冲锋的人数一次比一次增加。这一次，他们仍分三路冲上来，人数多得不可数。一班班副刘占清，从制高点的哨岗俯视，黑压压的像狼群一样。情势是严重的。对付这么多敌人，连长想：“单从正面反击是不成的。”他和指导员研究后，决定分两路反击。指导员带领作为预备队的第二排从左侧迂回反击；连长带着一、三两排从正面反击。敌人已喝醉了酒，醉醺醺地猛冲上来。这时，三连的战士们特别沉着，每一颗手榴弹甩出去后，只见在尘土飞溅的地方，敌人群里便缺一个口。敌人遭到致命的反击后，才如大梦初醒一般，纷纷溃败下去。
    战斗转入最壮烈的阶段。敌人四次冲锋都惨败后，发疯了。他们不仅想占领这个阵地，而且想在占领前毁灭它。
    敌人开始第三次排炮。这一次排炮是空前的毒辣。除了四十余门榴弹炮和无座力炮以外，五十二辆坦克上的平射炮，还有无数的迫击炮都一齐轰击。飞机像一群疯狗，从四面八方俯冲下来，丢汽油弹、烧夷弹，打火箭炮、机关炮，扫射。总之，所有一切毁灭性的武器全都用上了。整整一个钟头，山崩地裂，阵地变成一片火海，没有一根草木是完整的，像煤油箱大的石头也被打得粉碎。黄土交织着火焰，虽然在白天，也难瞧见人面。
    阵地正在燃烧着。敌人在数十挺机枪的掩护下，又开始了接二连三地疯狂地冲锋。这时，阵地上已经分不出那里是正面，那里是侧面了。敌人从四面八方爬上来。我们的战士们在火海里和十数倍于自己的敌人周旋着。敌人先从那里上来，就在那里反击。赵连长谈起当时战斗的情形时说道：“向东面来的敌人甩了手雷（手榴弹）后，马上掉过头来用自动步枪射击西面来的敌人。”
    那些喝醉了酒、麻痹了神经才敢冲上来的敌人，不论多到什么程度，士气总是不高的。而我们的士气却是越打越高涨。这一天，没有一个指战员轻伤下火线。八班班长、共产党员申德恩，第一次反击时左眼负了伤，连长叫他下去，他说：“不要紧，还有右眼可以瞄准，只要手不断，我就坚持到底。”直到右臂和腿负伤后，他才回后方去。一班班长涂金，也是一个共产党员。在杨站战役时，曾因为独自冲上敌人阵地占领山头，立了一大功。在这一天战斗中，他的左耳负了伤，血流满脸，像一个血人，连长劝他下去，他拒绝了，而且越打越勇敢，最后甚至站了起来打，直到一颗子弹打过他的前额，光荣殉国为止。他是永垂不朽的。还有十九岁的王启春，在战斗最剧烈时要求在火线上入党。像申德恩、涂金和王启春这样的英雄，在中国人民志愿军里是数不清的。特别是三连，我们可以说，参加这一次战斗的四十五个人全是英雄，英雄终于战胜了敌人第七次冲锋。
    太阳西斜，将近三点钟的时分了。飞机远离了，炮声断断续续。这是一场拼杀以后，也是另一场拼杀以前的片刻沉静。三连阵地上现在还有五个人，手榴弹没有了，每人还有三几粒子弹。战士们一面说着谈着，一面互相扑灭棉衣上的火。然后，用美国飞机掉下来的宣传纸来卷烟吸。战士们狠狠地吸了一口，慢慢地喷出来，白色的烟飘忽在晴空里。这时，山底下，美国人在喝酒。一个自称为“北京人”的女人，在坦克里用中国话作无耻而徒然的广播。她叫道：“中国人投降吧！”战士们气愤极了，狠狠地骂道：“不知耻的婆娘，投你妈的屁！”在公路上，十几辆汽车满载着活的“炮灰”从京安里开来，又满载着被打伤了的“炮灰”回去。
    连长估计这一天还会有一次战斗，叫同志们准备反击。果然，第八次反击真的来了。敌人和前几次一样，在猛烈的火力掩护下，从四面八方冲上来。这是一场生死的决斗，虽然，很快地把敌人的凶焰压下去了，但在搏斗还延续着的时候，阵地上只剩下连长和刘占清两个人了。刘占清还有三粒子弹，连长只是盒子枪里还有四粒子弹。这时，连长的心情比较复杂了。他所考虑的不是生死问题，他不怕死，早已下定“与阵地共存亡”的决心。他所考虑的，是营教导员方忻同志。方忻同志今年才二十七岁，是模范教导员。自从这个营担负守备任务以后，他和营指挥员一样，已经五天五夜没睡觉了。自从营长上午牺牲以后，他一直在营指挥所里指挥战斗。一种对同志的爱，对革命事业的责任感驱策着赵连长，使他不得不在最后决斗前劝教导员离开指挥所。
    “教导员同志！你快一点离开吧！我们就进行最后的决斗了！”赵连长以虔诚的声音想说服教导员。但教导员也早下定“与阵地共存亡”的决心。他在昨天晚上已经烧掉了所有的文件！现在，他静静地坐在掩蔽部电话机的旁边。赵连长带着深厚友情的劝告使他难过。他知道，在这个时刻，把自己的决心说出来，会使赵连长难过的。他索性没有答应，像没有听到一样。一直到最后，他带着营指挥所的二个通讯员和一个电话员向敌人反击，在反击中光荣殉国了。
    赵连长正在呼唤教导员的时候，四个敌人冲上来。这四个敌人没有打枪，看样子，他们是想抓活的，他们真是白天做梦。赵连长把最珍贵的四粒盒子枪子弹拿出来了。一连打出去，三个敌人应声栽倒，剩下的那个敌人，拿起卡宾枪就射击。那家伙倒霉，卡宾枪打不响。那家伙又跳过来用枪托用力的向赵连长脖子打过来，把他打倒了。一股生死搏斗的勇气支撑着赵连长，使他迅速地站起来，并用尽毕生的气力，用盒子枪的枪托向那家伙的头打过去，把他打得发出一声哀叫，抱住头滚下山去了。赵连长自己也昏倒在阵地上。
    刘占清看见连长昏倒后，跑过来把他拖下山。
    他们来到绷带所。那里还有五个重伤号，另外还有营通讯员王青山，他是和教导员向敌人作最后的反击时剩下来的。赵连长从昏迷中醒过来，王青山告诉他教导员牺牲的经过，他心里很难过。在战场上不准想到的而在这短促的片刻中，二十五年来使他难忘的事都涌上来了，他想着自己的过去。九岁上就帮地主扛活，挨骂受打，直到日本投降后，才参加八路军。现在，家里已分了土地，有吃有穿的，自己还娶了媳妇。在美国人打到鸭绿江边的时候，赵连长参加了中国人民志愿军。出国之前，他的爱人到开原车站来送行。临行前，两人还订有立功竞赛的规约：她在家里争取做生产模范，争取入党；他答应在抗美援朝中，争取做英雄。“今天守阵地的结果，还算什么英雄？”他自己问道。他想到自己的连队，想到牺牲了的涂金，想到负伤了的指导员，想到傅国良，王启春………，最后想到教导员与营长，特别是营长。他还清清楚楚地记得，今天早上在营指挥所里和营长最后的一次谈话。那时，营长把守备三五三高地任务交给他以后，对他说：“赵连长，曹操兵倒退八十里，希望你不要带曹操兵。”他也以坚决的口吻向营长保证：“请你放心，我绝对不带曹操兵，人在阵地在。”现在呢，两位首长的尸首还没有抬下来………。所想到的一切，仿佛都在召唤他战斗。他难过极了，拔起腿来就要往山上跑。重伤员问他上那儿，他说：“上去干吗！我还要和敌人拼！”刘占清和重伤员，抱住他的腿不让走，重伤员梁忠信哭着说：“连长，弹药没有了，你上去不是给抓俘虏吗？你要是上去，我们大家都上去。为了打垮美帝国主义，我们生同生，死同死！”大家都被感动得流泪了。这种泪并不是懦怯的表示，而是充满了报仇杀敌的光辉。现在，我在前线又看到赵连长重新组织力量，继续抗击敌人了。
