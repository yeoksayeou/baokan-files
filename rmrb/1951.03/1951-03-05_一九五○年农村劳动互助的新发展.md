　　New Developments in Rural Labor Mutual Aid in 1950
　　In 1950, the labor mutual aid movement in the old revolutionary base areas achieved widespread development. In Northeast China, 80% of farming households were organized, a 15% increase compared to 1949; in North China's Changzhi, Pingshun, and eight other counties in Shanxi, statistics showed that 75% of the labor force was organized; in the southern mountainous areas of Hebei Province, 54% of farming households were organized; and in Shandong Province, 33% of farming households were organized, with Laiyang and Jiaozhou prefectures reaching 60%.

　　As early as the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, rural labor mutual aid organizations were relatively common in the old liberated areas, playing a significant role in maintaining agricultural production, overcoming labor and livestock shortages, and supporting the front lines. After the implementation of land reform and several years of the Great Production Movement, labor mutual aid organizations became a major link in restoring and developing agricultural production. Therefore, labor mutual aid organizations have a deep mass base in the rural areas of the old liberated areas.

　　With the end of the war, the reduction of war service, and the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production, the rural economy of the old liberated areas has gradually improved, and the lives of farmers have become increasingly prosperous, leading to new changes in labor mutual aid. On the one hand, labor and livestock have relatively increased, and difficulties have decreased. On the other hand, the vast majority of farmers urgently require new methods of increasing production, so the old content of mutual aid (i.e., organizing to overcome labor and livestock shortages) can no longer fully meet the new demands of farmers. Correctly solving this problem has become a crucial key to further developing labor mutual aid. In the past year, based on this new situation, local leaders, in addition to continuing to implement the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit in mutual aid groups and further clarifying that the purpose of organizing is to increase production so that farmers gradually move towards a prosperous life, have also timely proposed new content that closely combines labor mutual aid with improved technology, enabling labor mutual aid in the old areas to continue to develop in 1950.

　　I. The combination of labor mutual aid and improved technology has brought agricultural production in the old areas into a new era. In Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and other provinces, many mutual aid groups conducted improved technology work in agricultural production in 1950, including trying out new agricultural tools, promoting improved varieties, disinfecting seeds, practicing intensive cultivation, processing and applying fertilizers, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, which improved the production efficiency of the mutual aid groups and increased yields. The Zhang Ziquan mutual aid group in Dazhai Village, Yushi, Shanxi, paid attention to improving production technology. In addition to extracting a portion of land as a "small farm" to experiment with various varieties, they also combined with the village technical committee to study the use of twelve kinds of fertilizers and adjusted the soil on 156 mu of land, which greatly increased yields. In 1950, the average yield of the whole group was 141.1 liters per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 27 liters. The Gao Guandou mutual aid group in Dahujia Village, Shen County, Hebei Province, absorbed experienced old farmers in the village to jointly study how to improve production technology. In addition to using new scientific technologies, they also summarized and improved the old agricultural production experience. In the past, the village used narrow seed drills of 1.15 chi. The old farmers studied and changed them to wide seed drills of 1.35 chi, which not only saved one-fifth of the labor per mu but also increased grain production by 20 to 30 liters.

　　II. In the old areas, mutual aid groups have found a way out for a large number of surplus rural laborers as a result of combining with sideline production. Farmers in these areas have saved a large amount of labor by organizing labor mutual aid. Many regions, based on their specific local conditions, have organized this surplus labor to engage in sideline and handicraft production such as transportation, oil pressing, weaving, and opening workshops, enriching the content of mutual aid and turning seasonal agricultural mutual aid groups into long-term mutual aid groups that combine agriculture and sideline occupations. The mutual aid group of labor model Jia Baozhi in Shanxi Province combined agriculture and sideline occupations, which not only solved the problem of firewood and oil for the group members but also solved the fertilizer problem for the entire group's land. The sideline income of each laborer in the group accounted for 50% of the agricultural income (about 10 shi of coarse grains).

　　III. The economic assistance of rural supply and marketing cooperatives to mutual aid groups has played a significant role in the consolidation and development of mutual aid groups. In 1950, the supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas, in addition to systematically supplying the mutual aid groups with living and production materials, also strived to open up sales channels for the surplus agricultural and sideline products of the mutual aid groups and organized the surplus rural labor force to engage in sideline production. For example, the supply and marketing cooperatives in two districts of Lin County, Pingyuan, signed more than 100 contracts for purchasing and selling goods on behalf of mutual aid groups, helping the mutual aid groups to sell a large number of sideline products such as native cloth, hemp, and straw hats. At the same time, they also supported the mutual aid groups to organize transportation production, thus enabling more than 2,000 of the 6,000 temporary agricultural mutual aid groups in the county to develop into long-term mutual aid groups that combined agriculture and sideline occupations.

　　IV. The use of new agricultural tools in mutual aid groups has changed the form of mutual aid groups. In 1950, these areas established agricultural tool stations to promote new agricultural tools. The Northeast Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry used more than 330 sets of Soviet-style horse-drawn agricultural implements, in addition to distributing them to state-owned farms for trial use, and also lent them to mutual aid groups for use, which not only changed the form of mutual aid groups (from small-scale mutual aid groups to large-scale mutual aid groups or joint groups) but also greatly improved production efficiency. The use of new agricultural tools improved old farming habits. The Wang Zhentang mutual aid group in Heilongjiang used two sets of Soviet horse-drawn agricultural implements, which greatly increased productivity. In 1950, the whole group reclaimed 97 qing, equivalent to 1,455 mu, exceeding the cultivated area in 1949 by more than 88%. The village was originally barren and poor. Due to organization and the use of new agricultural tools, the group had a surplus of 700 shi of grain. The Han Si mutual aid group in Bao'an Village, Jiaohe, Jilin, used new agricultural tools, changed the old farming methods, broke the farming habits of the masses for many years, and enabled the mutual aid group to make more significant achievements. At the same time, the use of new agricultural tools improved labor efficiency, saving more labor, which was invested in sideline occupations and factories, earning more income to improve living standards or expand reproduction.

　　V. With the development of production and the long-term collective labor of mutual aid groups, many mutual aid groups in these areas have developed from simple labor mutual aid to economic cooperation. Collective economic cooperation and collective management enterprises in mutual aid groups have gradually increased. This situation is more significant in the northeastern and northern provinces and Shandong Province. According to a survey of 155 agricultural labor models leading mutual aid groups in Shanxi, more than 67% of them have such property, including agricultural tools, waterwheels, livestock, sheep flocks, land, grain, etc. Most of them appeared when one person could not afford to buy them or could not organize them. Some collectively reclaimed wasteland and afforested, some collectively purchased agricultural tools, and some collectively organized charity granaries to prepare for famine. However, this form of collective ownership did not destroy the foundation of private property. For example, the purchase of agricultural tools mostly adopts the method of spreading shares according to land, jointly purchasing, specially managed, everyone using, withdrawing shares when leaving the group, and adding shares when joining the group.

　　This collective economic cooperation, developed under the principle of mass voluntarism, does help the development of production, overcomes the difficulties that small producers cannot overcome with their individual strength but are necessary for production, provides a new way for rural areas to run larger production enterprises, and at the same time makes the mutual aid groups more consolidated. For example, after the Guo Yu'en mutual aid group in Pingshun, Shanxi, collectively purchased more than 20 large agricultural tools, the group members felt that they spent less money and did more things, and they did not lack anything in production, and no one wanted to leave the mutual aid group. The Yang Xicheng mutual aid group in Tunliu County, Shanxi, has lent money to the masses to buy 9 livestock and 8 large carts since it established a charity granary in 1950, and also solved the financial difficulties in sideline production, which has been welcomed by the masses.

### 一九五○年农村劳动互助的新发展

　　一九五○年农村劳动互助的新发展
    一九五○年老区的劳动互助运动，已获得普遍的发展。东北全区组织起来的农户达百分之八十较一九四九年增加百分之十五；华北区山西长治平顺等十个县统计，组织起来的劳动力达百分之七十五；河北省南部山区组织起来的农户达百分之五十四；山东全省组织起来的农户达百分之三十三，该省莱阳胶州等专区达百分之六十。
    早在抗日战争和解放战争时期，老解放区农村劳动互助组织即比较普遍，对于维持农业生产，克服劳畜力困难，和支援前线起了重大作用。实行土地改革后，经过几年来的大生产运动，劳动互助组织更成为恢复和发展农业生产的主要环节。因此，劳动互助组织在老解放区农村有着深厚的群众基础。
    随着战争的结束，战勤的减少，农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，老解放区农村经济已逐渐上升，农民生活也日渐富裕，因而使劳动互助发生了新的变化。一方面由于劳畜力相对增加，困难减少，另一方面，广大农民迫切要求新的增产方法，这样旧的互助内容（即组织起来克服劳畜力困难），已不能满足或完全满足农民新的要求。正确解决这个问题已成为进一步发展劳动互助的重要关键。一年来各地领导上根据这一新的情况，除在互助组中继续贯彻自愿两利的政策，和进一步明确了组织起来是以增加生产使农民逐渐走向生活富裕为目的外，并及时地提出劳动互助与改良技术等密切结合的新内容，使一九五○年老区的劳动互助获得继续发展。
    一、劳动互助与提高技术相结合，使老区农业生产进入到一个新的时期。山东、河北、山西、平原等省不少互助组，在一九五○年的农业生产中均进行了试用新农具、推广良种、种子消毒、精耕细作、加工施肥、防治病虫害等改良技术工作，使互助组的生产效率提高，并增加了产量。山西榆社大寨村张志全互助组，因为注意改良生产技术，除抽出一部分土地作为“小农场”进行试验各种品种外，并和村技术委员会结合研究了十二种肥料的用法，调剂土壤的土地共一百五十六亩，结果使产量大大提高。一九五○年全组每亩平均产量为一石四斗一升，超过战前二斗七升。河北省深县大护驾庄高贯斗互助组，吸收本村有经验的老农共同研究如何提高生产技术，除引用新的科学技术外，还总结和提高了旧有的农业生产经验。过去这村用一尺一寸五的窄耧，老农们研究改成了一尺三寸五的宽耧，每亩地不但可以节省五分之一的人工，还可增产二斗到三斗粮食。
    二、老区互助组由于与副业生产结合的结果，使农村大批剩余劳动力找到了出路。各该地农民因为组织劳动互助，节省了大批劳动力。许多地区依据本地具体情况，将这批剩余劳力分别组织起来进行运输、榨油、编织和开作坊等副业与手工业生产，使互助的内容丰富多样，并且使季节性的农业互助组成为农副业结合的长期互助组。山西省劳动模范贾宝执的互助组，使农副业结合，不仅解决了组员烧火点油，还解决了全组土地的肥料问题，组内每个劳动力的副业收入竟占农业收入的百分之五○（约十石左右的粗粮）。
    三、农村供销合作社对互助组的经济扶助，对互助组的巩固和发展起了重大的作用。各该地供销合作社，于一九五○年除去有计划的供给互助组的生活与生产资料外，并努力为互助组的剩余农副业产品，打开销路，以及组织农村剩余劳动力进行副业生产。如平原林县两个区的供销社，曾与互助组订立了代购、代销合同百余件，帮助互助组推销了土布、大麻、草帽等大批副业产品，同时还扶植互助组组织运输生产，因而使该县六千多个临时农业互助组中有两千余个发展到农副业结合的长年互助组。
    四、互助组引用了新式农具，使互助组的形式起了变化。一九五○年各该地都设立了农具站，推广新式农具。东北农林部以三百三十多台苏联式的马拉农具，除分配在公营农场进行试用外，并贷给互助组使用，因而不仅使互助组的形式有了变化（使从小型互助组发展到大型互助组或是联组），而且还大大地提高了生产效率。改良了旧的耕作习惯。黑龙江王振堂互助组，使用了两套苏联马拉农具，生产力飞跃提高。一九五○年全组开荒九十七垧，合一四五五亩，超过一九四九年耕地面积的百分之八十八强。这村原来地瘠民贫，由于组织起来使用了新式农具，组内余粮七百石。吉林蛟河保安屯韩思互助组，使用新式农具，改变了旧的耕作方法，打破了群众多年的耕作习惯，使互助组更好的做出显著的成绩。同时由于使用新农具后，提高了劳动效率，节余出更多的劳力，投入到副业和工厂中，获得更多的收入，以提高生活水平或扩大再生产。
    五、随着生产的发展和互助组长期的集体劳动，目前各该地有不少的互助组由单纯劳力互助发展到经济合作。互助组内集体的经济合作和集体经营的事业逐渐增加。东北华北各省及山东省等地此种情况比较显著，据山西一百五十五个农业劳动模范领导的互助组调查，就有百分之六十七以上有此种财产，包括农具、水车、牲口、羊群、土地、粮食等，其中大多数是在一人置买不起或不能举办的情况下出现的，有的集体开荒造林，有的集体购买农具，有的为了备荒而集体举办义仓。但是这种集体占有形式，并没有破坏私有财产的基础。如农具的购买大多采取按地摊股、共同置买、专人保管、大家使用、退组退股、入组加股等办法。
    这种在群众自愿原则下发展起来的集体的经济合作，确实有助于生产的发展，克服了小生产者个人力量所不能及而又为生产所必需的困难，给农村举办较大的生产事业提示了一条新的道路，同时使互助组更加巩固。如山西平顺郭玉恩互助组，集体购买了二十多件大农具后，组员都觉得花钱少、办事大，在生产上用啥不缺啥，谁也不愿离开互助组。山西屯留县杨喜成互助组，自一九五○年举办了义仓后，贷给群众买下九头牲口、八辆大车，还解决了副业生产中的资金困难，受到了群众的欢迎。
