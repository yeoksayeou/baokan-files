    Mr. Meng Yuren's Self-Criticism
    Reader Ding Xintian wrote to us with several questions regarding the translation by Meng Yuren et al. of "Soviet Commerce and Its Role in the Development of the Soviet National Economy," published by World Knowledge Press, Shanghai, January 1951. We asked comrades from the "Translation Bulletin" to proofread it against the original Russian text, and in the first ten pages (out of forty pages in the whole book), approximately six thousand words, we found (1) thirty places where the translation was completely inconsistent with the original meaning, and (2) sixty places where there were discrepancies with the original meaning; although there were also individual places where the translation was relatively good. Judging from the translation, the translator was unfamiliar with translation work, economic knowledge, and even general common translations. Obvious examples are: the translator translated the Soviet "Union" as "Federation," "capitalist elements" as "capitalist molecules," and "socialist economic system" as "socialist organized economy," and so on.
    We forwarded the reader's letter and the reviewers' comments to World Knowledge Press. World Knowledge Press recently gave us a reply, and attached Mr. Meng Yuren's self-criticism to us. Mr. Meng's self-criticism is as follows:
    "My Russian foundation is very shallow. In addition, I have never translated works on economics before. I felt a great lack of reference books at hand, and there was nowhere to ask for advice. I should not have rashly accepted the translation of "Soviet Commerce and Its Role in the Development of the Soviet National Economy." After finishing the translation, I wanted to ask someone to proofread it again, but I was limited by objective conditions and did not succeed. I rashly submitted it to the publisher for publication. Although the translated manuscript was sent along with the original text, I did not ask them in writing or orally to ask someone to proofread it again, which caused the current errors. I should be fully responsible for this myself. But now I don't know how to compensate for the losses to the publisher and readers of the book? Now, in addition to spurring myself to be extra careful in future translation work and not to engage in it lightly, I offer my utmost apologies and thanks to the readers and reviewers for their serious criticism. I am willing to study Russian for another ten years to prove with action that I can truly accept their well-intentioned criticism."
    Mr. Meng's attitude of frank self-criticism is very good. We hope everyone will pay attention to this issue: "rashly engaging" in translation work is not advisable, this is one point; secondly, publishers should not casually publish manuscripts that are commissioned or submitted.
  Opinions on "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun"
    Wanye Bookstore in Shanghai published "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun" (compiled by Li Shizhao and drawn by Sun Zhi?) in January this year. Reader Wang Yibo wrote to us, offering the following opinions on this book:
    "The Chinese people have a great tradition of diligence and perseverance. Even under the feudal and reactionary rule in history, many admirable figures emerged. Wu Xun, who begged for alms to start schools, is one of them. Wu Xun should be commended. However, commending Wu Xun does not mean presenting all of Wu Xun's deeds, especially today when we are conducting education for the working people that is completely different from the era in which Wu Xun lived. For example, is there any need for us to retain the methods he often used, such as 'kneeling to request' and 'kneeling to beg'? Furthermore, some hypocritical sympathy and commendation materials from the feudal ruling class that have no relationship to Wu Xun's spirit, personality, and career (such as sections 60, 65, 66, 67, 82, 83, 85, and attached pictures) are also adopted in an objectivist manner. Although the author stated that they were 'preserved with criticism,' this is completely unnecessary. Also, what I disagree with most in this book is a sentence in the 'Author's Preface': 'In fact, Mr. Wu Xun is a most typical and concrete practitioner of historical materialism. In order to earn money, he could live a non-human life like cattle and horses. As long as he achieved his goal of "accumulating money to start schools," he could be beaten, scolded, and insulted by anyone.' Such a superficial, vulgar, and erroneous interpretation of historical materialism is harmful."
    We believe that Wang Yibo's opinions are worthy of attention.
  Erroneous "Illustrations of Meritorious Officials and Generals of Past Dynasties"
    The Social Service Department of the Northeast Daily wrote to us to tell us that readers accused the "Illustrations of Meritorious Officials and Generals of Past Dynasties" published by Changchun Picture Company in Shanghai of not having a people's stand, juxtaposing true heroes with reactionary figures, and failing to distinguish between loyalty and treachery. We checked the original picture and confirmed this opinion.
    First of all, the title is inappropriate. Obviously, the wording of the title reflects the position of the feudal rulers. The heroes and meritorious officials in Chinese history can only be meritorious officials of the people, not meritorious officials of the imperial families of various dynasties. Secondly, there is a failure to distinguish between loyalty and treachery. The reactionary warlord Wu Peifu is called a "great figure for all ages"; Nian Gengyao is also a "meritorious official"; however, Yue Fei, the national hero known to us all, cannot occupy a seat. Thirdly, many of the explanations on the picture are inappropriate. This picture does not state the year of publication, and it is obviously a reprint based on an old version from many years ago. Such harmful publications should not be allowed to circulate in the market. Changchun Picture Company should conduct a self-criticism on this matter.

    孟虞人先生的检讨
    读者丁新田君来信对孟虞人等译、世界知识社上海造一九五一年一月版《苏维埃商业及其在苏联国民经济发展中的作用》一书的译文，提出若干疑问。我们请《翻译通报》的同志们对照俄文原本校阅了一下，在一至十页（全书四十页）约六千字的译文中，发现（一）与原意完全不对的有三○处，（二）与原意有出入的六○处；虽然也有个别地方译得还好。从译文上看，译者对翻译工作、经济知识乃至一般普通译名都很生疏，显明的例证是：译者把苏维埃“联盟”译成了“联邦”，把“资本主义因素”译成“资本主义分子”，把“社会主义经济体系”译成“社会主义组织经济”等等。
    我们曾把读者来信和校阅者的意见，一并转给世界知识社。世界知识社最近给了我们答复，并附了孟虞人先生的检讨给我们。孟先生的检讨如下：
    “我俄文根底很浅，加之以前从未译过经济学的著作，手头工具书既极感缺乏，又无处可以就教，原不应贸然接受《苏维埃商业及其在苏联国民经济发展中的作用》一书的译事。译完后虽曾想托人再校一遍，但又为客观条件所限而不果，即冒失交出版者出版。虽译稿和原文一起送去，但并未用书面或口头转请他们托人再校一遍，致造成现在这样的错误，完全应由我自己负责。但我现在不知要怎样才能补偿对于该书的出版者和读者的损失？现在除鞭策自己此后对于翻译工作应该加倍慎重，再勿轻率从事外，对于读者和校阅者给我的严正批评，更致无上的歉意和感谢。并愿此后再学俄文十年，用行动来证明我真正能接受他们的善意的批评。”
    孟先生坦白检讨的态度是很好的。希望大家都注意这个问题：“轻率从事”翻译工作是不足取的，这是一；其次，出版者把约来的或送来的稿件随便拿来出版，也是不应该的。
  对《武训画传》提意见
    上海万叶书店本年一月出版了一本《武训画传》（李士钊编、孙之?绘），读者王一波君在给我们的信中，对这本书提了如下的意见：
    “中国人民是有着勤劳坚毅的伟大传统的，即使在历史上封建反动的统治下，仍然出现不少可歌可泣的人物，行乞兴学的武训就是其中之一。武训是应该受到表扬的。然而表扬武训并不等于把武训的事迹全部搬了出来，特别是在今天我们对劳动人民进行着与武训所处时代迥不相同的教育的时候。例如他经常使用的‘跪请’、‘跪求’等方式，我们有什么必要把它保留下来呢？又如把某些对于武训的精神、人格和事业并无关系的封建统治阶级的伪善的同情和旌表材料（如六○、六五、六六、六七、八二、八三、八五等节及附图）也客观主义地采入了，虽然著者曾说明‘加以批判的保留下来’，但这是完全不必要的。还有，在这本书中，最不能使我同意的是《著者序》中的一句话：‘实际上武训先生是一个最典型最具体的历史唯物主义的身体力行者，他为了赚钱可以过非人的牛马生活，只要达到他的‘积钱兴学’的目的，他可以任人打骂和侮辱。’这样肤浅地、庸俗地、错误地解释历史唯物主义，是有害的。”
    我们以为，王一波君的意见是值得重视的。
  错误的《历朝功臣名将图》
    东北日报社会服务部来信告诉我们：读者指责上海长春画片公司出版的《历朝功臣名将图》没有人民立场，把真正英雄与反动人物并列，忠奸不分。我们对照了原图，肯定这一意见。
    首先，标题是不妥当的。很明显的，标题的提法反映了封建统治者的立场。中国历史上的英雄和功臣，当然只能是人民的功臣，而不能是各朝代帝王家族的功臣。其次，是忠奸不分。反动军阀吴佩孚被称为“昭垂万世之伟大人物”；年羹尧也是“功臣”；然而我们众所皆知的民族英雄岳飞反而不能占一席。再次，图上的说明，有很多是不恰当的。这幅图没有载明出版年月，显然是依据许多年前的旧版翻印的，这种有害的出版物，不应听其在市场上流行。长春画片公司对这件事应该进行检讨。
