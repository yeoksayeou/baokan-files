The clauses are as follows:

    Article 1: Party A entrusts Party B to handle all matters related to cotton pre-purchase.

    Article 2: The pre-purchase targets are mainly cooperative members, and pre-purchase may also be carried out with non-members at the same time.

    Article 3: The pre-purchase time shall be in principle before the cotton planting season, but pre-purchase shall also be carried out when cotton farmers request it after planting and before harvest.

    Article 4: The pre-purchase locations shall be in cotton-producing areas and in areas with cooperative primary organizations.

    Article 5: In good seed management areas, the pre-purchase of cotton shall be mainly seed cotton, and in other areas, both lint cotton and seed cotton shall be purchased.

    Article 6: When cooperatives carry out pre-purchase, in areas with better conditions, they should strive to sign contracts for more than half of the cotton based on the local cotton production situation before the new cotton is available on the market. The specific figures shall be agreed upon by the large administrative region, provincial, or county cooperative and the local state-owned trade department.

    Article 7: Pre-purchase price:

    1. The cotton-grain price ratio stipulated by the state shall be the actual pre-purchase price obtained by farmers. After the new cotton is on the market, Party A shall stipulate the list price according to the price ratio, and purchase at the list price, listening to increases and not decreases; and ensure premium prices for superior grades and lower prices for inferior grades according to the standard of 7/8 medium-grade American cotton.

    Article 8: When Party A carries out purchase when new cotton is on the market, in addition to supplying the four kinds of physical guarantees of grain, coal, salt, and fertilizer listed in Party B's "order form" on time, Party A shall also pay a portion of currency. If cotton farmers voluntarily agree, a portion or most of the payment can also be deferred according to the principle of listening to increases and not decreases.

    Article 9: Specific methods:

    1. When Party B's primary cooperative carries out pre-purchase, within the scope of the four main physical objects of grain, coal, salt, and fertilizer supplied by Party A and the percentage of supply, cotton farmers shall submit an "order form" (format to be determined separately) according to their living and production needs. Party A shall guarantee to supply the items listed in the "order form" on time when collecting cotton, but the price of the supplied items shall not be higher than the market price, and cooperative members shall be given preferential treatment in accordance with the two, three, four, five, and six preferential measures stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. Non-members shall not enjoy preferential treatment.

    In order to facilitate Party A's allocation of supplied items, Party B's county cooperative shall fill in a "report form" (format to be determined separately) every half month (mid-month, end-of-month) after the pre-purchase begins, and report to the local cotton yarn and cloth company and the provincial and special cooperative respectively.

    2. Party B shall use the county cooperative as the clearing unit and conduct settlement with the nearest cotton yarn and cloth company regularly under the unified leadership of the provincial cooperative.

    Article 10: In order to facilitate the progress of the pre-purchase business, if Party A has surplus capacity before cotton planting or during the green-yellow period, and cotton farmers do have difficulties, especially in the heavily affected areas and main cotton-producing areas, Party A should pay a portion of grain to cotton farmers in advance. The advance ratio shall not exceed 20% of the total value of the pre-purchased cotton. The advance grain shall not be calculated as interest and shall be used as a "deposit" for the pre-purchased cotton. When the cotton harvesting period arrives, the cotton farmers shall repay the cotton at the cotton-grain list price at the time and place. Party A shall be responsible for guaranteeing the recovery and return of the physical objects prepaid.

    Article 11: The trade departments and cooperative general offices of the major administrative regions (or the provincial commercial halls and provincial general offices) should sign specific contracts in accordance with the principles of this agreement (such as changing the principles, it must be approved), arrange for implementation at each level, and earnestly assume the responsibility of organization, supervision, inspection, and summarization.
