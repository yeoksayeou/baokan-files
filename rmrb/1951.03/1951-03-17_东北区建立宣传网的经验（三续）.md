The second task is to publicize the policies and decisions of the Party and the People's Government, as well as the tasks of the people, especially the direct tasks of the time and place.

Policies are the foundation of life in our New Democratic country. From the Party's various policies, we can see our direction and great ideals for building a new China. The task of propagandists is to spread the Party and government's policies and decisions to the broad masses of the people through oral and written propaganda, guide the masses to realize these policies and decisions with practical actions, and guide the masses to establish and improve new labor achievements with a heroic labor attitude.

In the past year, in the production of industrial and mining enterprises, with the development and requirements of the production movement, our propaganda content has focused on publicizing various policies and decisions such as carrying out production competitions, improving product quality, increasing labor productivity, strengthening business management, uniting employees, technicians, and labor insurance benefits. This has continuously improved the ideological and political awareness of the working class, unleashed the production enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, consolidated labor discipline and production order in the factories, further united the workers with employees and technicians, and closely combined labor and technology, thus ensuring the fulfillment of the national production plan.

In agricultural production, we have focused on publicizing various policies and decisions such as restoring and developing agriculture, improving agricultural technology, improving varieties, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, strengthening labor exchange and mutual assistance, organizing supply and marketing cooperatives, reasonably burdening, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas. This has continuously improved the political awareness of the peasant masses, unleashed the production enthusiasm and creativity of the peasant masses, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas, and ensured the completion of the agricultural production plan.

Propagandists in various places have done a lot of work in publicizing the Party's policy decisions and the tasks of the people, especially the direct tasks of the time and place. They can closely integrate with production, specifically resolve the masses' concerns, and powerfully promote production and construction.

Comrade Xu Xianmin, a propagandist (should be a reporter) of Hegang Coal Mine, gave a talk to advanced producers of the entire mine on July 28th last year entitled "Implementing the Decision of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration to Implement the New Coal Mining Method."

First, he pointed out the harm of the old coal mining method to the workers. He said: "Using this method (the old method) of coal mining has caused fifteen of our worker brothers to die this year, fourteen of whom died from "roof falls." This is very painful, and we cannot allow it to happen in the future, because this is our working class's own mine, and those who work here are our worker brothers. But what is the solution to eradicate this phenomenon? Continue to use the old methods of the Japanese? No, because our fifteen worker comrades died! So what method should we use? Definitely, only by implementing the new coal mining method. The experience of the 120 and 103 working faces has proven this point, proving that it can not only avoid danger and reliably guarantee our lives, but also reduce physical labor."

He continued to talk about the benefits of the new coal mining method to the country. He said: "Taking Xingshan Mine as an example, there are still ×× tons of reserves. The old method can extract up to 30% to 40%, but the new coal mining method has increased the recovery rate (i.e., the percentage of coal extracted) to more than 90%. This is why we want to implement the new coal mining method."

Finally, his speech linked the consistency of national interests and worker interests. He said: "Last year, our mine lost ×× billion, because everyone didn't work hard enough. This year is different. In the first half of the year alone, we earned 763 billion for the country. We have earned back what we lost last year. Because everyone has brought out the attitude of being masters of the country, and with the help of Soviet experts, the country has earned money, and our wages have also increased by an average of 7%, not including welfare benefits. Now the Mining Bureau has decided to take out 4 billion to eliminate bedbugs for everyone, which will be basically completed in mid-August; and is preparing 2 billion to buy thermos bottles in Tianjin, one for each person, guaranteed to be done in August; and is starting to build an amateur sanatorium for everyone. Advanced representatives! This means that as long as the country earns money, our workers' lives will also improve. Finally, I hope to earn another 100 billion for the country in the second half of the year. What do you say?" Everyone said in unison: "Good!" Asked: "Do you have confidence?" Everyone answered confidently: "Yes!"

His words left a deep impression on the advanced producers. During the break, many workers said: "Now the country is thinking of us!" Because this speech can link the Party and government's policies with the interests of the workers, it enables the workers to consciously implement the Party and the state's policies.

Comrade Guo Shuqin, a propagandist of Harbin Woolen Mill, is a female worker and the propaganda committee member of the branch. When the factory accepted a new task in November last year, the various quotas in the workshop also needed to be changed. However, some workers could not immediately accept this new quota ideologically. For example, an old female worker said: "This can't be done, one person really can't stand it!" Most other workers also said: "The quota can't be reached, the output is high, and there are so few people..." There was no confidence in changing from two people looking after a case to one person. Comrade Guo Shuqin explained to the workers in response to this idea: "If we do it as before, we won't be able to reach the quota, and can the new task still be completed? Let's do it this way first, and everyone can think of ways! Now we are not familiar with it, but it will be better in a few days. We must overcome this difficulty, the soldiers at the front are much more bitter than us!" Several workers considered her speech and replied: "Let's try." Soon, Comrades Tang Shuhua and Ju Xiulan achieved six feet for one person looking after a case. Guo Shuqin publicized this fact at the workshop production meeting, and used this fact to illustrate that the new quota can be reached. She also organized people to write articles on the blackboard newspaper to commend them. This influenced and stimulated the idea of ​​every worker not to lag behind, brought out new heroism, and gradually made every worker complete and exceed the quota, averaging four and a half bolts (originally the highest for two people was five bolts). At the November production summary and award conference, twelve of the nineteen workers in the entire workshop were rewarded. Comrade Guo Shuqin thought of consolidating the achievements already received, and discussed with other propagandists to convene a workshop-wide workers' meeting through the workshop trade union. Comrade Guo Shuqin encouraged them and said: "Twelve workers in our workshop have won awards this time. We must maintain this honor. Workers who have not won awards must study hard and work hard to win awards next time, so that all the workers in our workshop will win awards, which will be even more glorious! Strive to be a model workshop!" Under her encouragement, the workers all said: "Strive to win awards in December and become a model workshop!" Indeed, in the recent selection of models, their workshop has been rated as a model workshop.

Last September, the ore dressing workshop of Anshan Ore Dressing Plant failed to complete the production task. At that time, the most urgent issue was how to improve technology, improve machine production efficiency, and increase output. However, the workers had doubts about improving the particle size of the crusher, believing that "the puppet Manchukuo Japanese devils were so capable, they didn't improve it, so we can't improve it even more." Comrade He Guozhao (technician), a propagandist of the field, studied with other propagandists under the leadership of the branch to get through the workers' thoughts. Later, they finally succeeded in researching, improving the particle size and increasing the output, and the quality was slightly better than before. By November, the output was able to complete the task, but the quality still did not meet the standard stipulated by the superior for concentrate to be 60% and tailings to be 12%. The key to improving quality was the ore dressing machine. The propagandist team of the factory conducted several special studies and found that the reason for the low quality of the magnetic separation machine was that several workers had poor political awareness and a weak sense of responsibility. Some of them were because their technology was poor and they could not properly maintain the roller skin, adjust the current and level, and could not accurately find the amount of ore, thus affecting the quality. Therefore, the propagandists put forward the slogan of "Protect the roller skin, adjust diligently, tailings twelve, fine six zero" and carried out patient education among the workers. This improved the quality and reached the standard stipulated by the superior.

Comrade Jin Fenglian, a propagandist of Anshan Ore Dressing Plant, is good at combining every ordinary thing to publicize the policies of the Party and the government and inspire the masses' patriotic ideas. For example, Zhang Qihe, a worker in the factory, was injured by being loaded into a machine in July and was recuperating at home. Comrade Jin Fenglian personally went to Zhang's home to express condolences. Because Zhang was a new worker and had not worked in the factory for a long time, he did not know that he was entitled to labor insurance benefits for work-related injuries. Zhang's parents spent a lot of money on medical treatment and were very worried. Comrade Jin Fenglian explained the labor insurance regulations to Zhang Qihe and his parents, and said: "Now the factory is fundamentally different from the puppet Manchukuo and the Kuomintang period. If you are injured, there are labor insurance regulations. In the puppet Manchukuo and the Kuomintang period, who would care if you died?" "Now the country cares about us very much. Old workers who are in poor health are also sent to sanatoriums, and there are nursing homes when they are old." Zhang Qihe's father said excitedly: "During the puppet Manchukuo period, someone lived in the factory and was injured, and the factory didn't want them. I have lived for so long, and this is the first time I have seen such a government and such good policies." When Jin Fenglian left, Zhang Qihe's father kept saying: "I will definitely take good care of Qihe's injury and recuperate, and go to work early when he is healed."

Comrade Wang Weisheng, a propagandist in Shangjiatai Village, Yingkou, Liaodong, played a major role in mobilizing and promoting the village's work in preparing for plowing, sowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest. His propaganda method is mainly through blackboard newspapers (he is illiterate and asks others to write). He closely combined with the central work, wrote vividly based on the specific situation, and issued it in a timely manner. The content was rich and well-received by the masses.

Last year, the spring neck was short, but the masses had the idea of ​​"wait and don't rush" when digging stubble. Comrade Wang Weisheng wrote: "Don't look at the ground being wet, the cracks are good for digging!" and promoted everyone with the appearance of his mutual aid group digging stubble: "The eleven members of the Erlu Mutual Aid Group, men, women, old and young, are digging stubble, and the old lady is spinning thread to take care of the house!" When mobilizing to plant cotton in time, he proposed: "Wet digging and dry beating is not bad, hurry up and plant cotton!" When promoting blood powder seed dressing and copper sulfate disinfection, he encouraged everyone: "We have gained clever experience in planting this year, blood powder and copper sulfate are mixed a lot, blood powder seed dressing is good for seedlings, and copper sulfate disinfection reduces head smut!" Under his slogan, the mutual aid group's seeds were not only all disinfected with copper sulfate, but also bought thirteen catties of blood powder for seed dressing. When repairing the river, he publicized among the masses who were working to repair the river: "First, don't be afraid of the large task of repairing the river, second, don't be afraid of the difficulties of repairing the river, we can definitely overcome it, third, don't be afraid of having things to do at home, there must be a way, and fourth, don't be afraid of heavy rain and land desertion, mutual assistance is powerful!" In order to plant the low-lying land in time, he said: "Don't look at the time being early, the low-lying land is good for early planting. If there is wind, there will be rain, and you can't plant if the water comes!" When the universal hoeing was started, he bought a red cloth and made a flag, on which was written: "Wang Weisheng Mutual Aid Group Hoeing Pioneer Brigade." After he went to the ground early and returned late, the nearby masses followed his red flag. Gong Guilin, Li Changmin and other mutual aid groups, as well as women's groups, saw the red flag on the ground and shouted: "Let's go! The red flag is on the ground!" In places far from the red flag, children broadcast on the roof: "The red flag is on the ground, everyone hurry to the ground!" In this way, more than 300 people in the village followed his red flag and promoted the village to do four hoeings. Except for three acres of land, all were hoeed four times. When pests started in the field, his blackboard newspaper timely wrote: "Seeing the pests starting, men and women help each other to catch insects. If the pests are caught quickly, the seedlings will be strong in autumn and there will be more grain!" He also mobilized students to beat drums, use boxes to hold pests, and take sorghum stalks damaged by insects to the streets to promote, arousing the attention of the whole village and launching an insect-catching movement. Every day, 300 people went to the ground, and the insects were caught in ten days. After hanging up the hoe, he proposed in response to the masses' habit of "resting": "Mutual assistance to prevent floods and build high dams can avoid crop suffering. If everyone wants a good life, they must engage in sideline occupations. Young people live in mines and salt flats, the elderly sell melons well, women spin thread to take care of chickens, or sell old clothes at the market. If you want a good life next year, don't let this year's manure pile be small. Hot water and tender grass are good for accumulating manure, cold water and old grass can't accumulate it, quickly pull artemisia grass, you couldn't pull it in the past, get up early and sleep late to pad the circle more, go to the ground during the day to catch big grass, and the grains will be good if the weeds are pulled out." In the fall, he said: "Frost falls and the leaves turn yellow, crops are on the field, the granary is full of grain, thank the Communist Party. I am the first to support the dependents, choose good cotton seeds, and sell them for money, and also be able to pay public grain. Go to the ground to dig stubble and prepare to set up the plow." When publicizing the resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, he said: "The Communist Party is really strong, calls for production to grow more grain, plant specialties, and enjoy happiness. Resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is the right thing to do, buy big cloth, make clothes, wear them and it won't be cold, and it will be beautiful to go out. Next year will be stronger than this year." When publicizing the payment of public grain, he said: "Why pay public grain? To support the front line and build factories. The front line eats its fill and wins battles, and the workers eat their fill and the machines sound. Make agricultural tools for good production, and make guns and cannons to send to the front. The country is rich and the people are strong, and American aggression will definitely fail." When publicizing the dispatch of stretchers, he said: "Our people are powerful, and we support the front line with stretchers. Don't worry about everything at home, the village government has a way. Prepare clothes, hats, shoes, and socks, and follow the volunteer army to aid Korea. If the soldiers are injured, the stretcher comrades should carry them well. The comrades are injured and cry in pain, and they should be comforted and understood. Volunteer aid to Korea to eliminate American imperialism is good, and those who come back from the front and back will make great contributions." When publicizing sideline occupations, he said: "The river water is freezing and the weather is cold. It's cold but we still earn money. Engage in sideline occupations and produce more, spin thread, weave mats, and support the front. It will not be difficult to have food and clothing to defeat American imperialism."

Comrade Ma Delian of Zhujia Kiln Village, Yanghe District, Liaodong, is an excellent propagandist. After returning home from participating in the first Northeast Regional Propaganda Representative Conference, he actively carried out propaganda work. At that time, the village was promoting the work of prize-winning savings. He immediately went to the neighborhood to carry out propaganda. The masses said: We take savings to build national defense well, and don't let the American devils invade again. The savings money will be returned in three months, and there will be prizes. That's great. In three days, the village saved more than 60 million yuan. When the Spring Festival was approaching, the masses requested to perform some street dramas and topical fast board, drum music, and ditties during the Spring Festival, so he compiled a "Drive Away American Devils" ditty: "1. The sun shines all over the sky, we celebrate 1951. In order to drive away the American devils, we support the war in Korea! 2. Brothers help each other in battle, also to protect our borders. Life and property will not be lost, step up production and build national defense. 3. Our national defense construction is strong, the front and rear have strength. World peace is guaranteed, even if the American wolves are crazy!"

Third, promote advanced production experience and encourage the people to actively complete tasks.

Timely dissemination of advanced production experience is of great importance to promoting production. Last year, in industrial production, we focused on publicizing experiences in improving product quality, strengthening the production responsibility system, and improving technology. The experience of the Ma Hengchang team and the Chen Yucai workshop has been popularized to various factories and mines in Northeast China due to the dissemination of propagandists in various places, which undoubtedly played a major role in strengthening the production responsibility system and improving product quality. In addition, various factories and mines have also done a lot of work in disseminating the production experience of each place. For example, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory manufactured ×× six-foot all-gear lathes in the first quarter, all of which did not meet the specifications and were criticized by the superiors. The morale of the general workers was low, and they had little confidence in completing the task in April. On April 19, the factory assembled five second-class lathes. The propagandists immediately seized this opportunity and drew an eye-catching propaganda painting with the title: "Assemble Five Second-Class Lathes and Strive for First-Class Products!" Carrying this painting, they paraded through the factory. The workers knew that the lathes met the specifications and their spirits were boosted, and their confidence in completing the task in April was increased. The fifth lathe group completed the monthly task in 22 days, and there were no defective products. The propagandists seized this example and carried out propaganda in a timely manner, drawing a realistic propaganda painting for the group, depicting the situation in which they completed the task ahead of schedule. At the same time, they issued a production extra, introducing the reason why they completed the task ahead of schedule - because they formulated a group plan. Due to the dissemination of this experience, the factory successfully completed ×× standard products by the end of May.

Fourth, expose the shortcomings of production and work and fight against the phenomenon of wasting state property.

Paying attention to consolidating national discipline and labor discipline at any time and place is one of the regular propaganda contents.

In January and February last year, the Anshan Machine Repair Factory was full of defective products, and the workers shirked responsibility to each other. The phenomenon of losing materials occurred everywhere. The workers took them as they used them, threw them away when they were broken, and took them again after they were thrown away. At the production meeting held by the Machine Tool Factory in March, Gao Fumian (a Communist Party member), the leader of the lathe class, proposed holding an exhibition of defective products. After preparations by the Party, government, trade union, and youth league, a product exhibition was officially held on May 5. The exhibits included defective products and the best ones, so that there was a comparison between good and bad. The exhibited defective products were tied with a "flyer" with the item, group, name, salary level, valuation, and reason written on it. This exhibition played a great role in improving quality and reducing defective products, and the workers who produced defective products received a very profound education. Some people stopped at the place where the bad work was exhibited, looked left and right, and everyone discussed it. Some took out a ruler to compare and measure it again and again, to see how much bigger or smaller it was, and how they started to cut it when they were turning it. During the five-day exhibition, many workers went to study whenever they had time, and some went as many as three or four times. Some said: "If the materials lost due to these defective products were invested in our country's economic construction and in our welfare undertakings, how great would its effect be? Such unintentional losses are so regrettable!" At the same time, it also aroused everyone's research on ways to prevent defective products. After this education, the casting shop of the factory reached a finished product rate of 96.42% in April, and the production task was completed by 116.20%. The iron bed class of the Machine Tool Factory had only two defective products in the more than 7,000 pieces of work in April. In early May, only two defective products appeared in the finished products of the entire Machine Tool Factory.

The ironworking class of the second manufacturing factory of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory often produced defective products. On May 27 alone, 31 pieces were scrapped, affecting assembly. The blackboard newspaper immediately sharply pointed out: "It is a disgrace to the working class to waste state property due to carelessness in work!" This aroused the vigilance of the ironworking class, and a meeting was held to review it. There was great progress in the work afterwards. From May 28 to June 7, only one defective product was produced.

Comrade Li Shulian, a propagandist of Hegang Coal Mine, regarded the mine as his own home and took special care of the mine equipment. When he saw that many usable pit props were being pressed into the pit when filling the pit, he felt very heartbroken. Therefore, he often took the initiative to carry out propaganda among the workers to protect state property. He said: "We must withdraw the usable pit props, which is convenient to use and saves money for the country." As a result of his repeated education, their team must withdraw all the usable pit props every time they fill the pit, saving a lot of money for the country.

The above-mentioned propaganda content are several aspects that we have paid more attention to in mass propaganda work in the past year, so that mass propaganda work has powerfully promoted national defense construction and production construction, and powerfully promoted various political movements of the people.

From the above propaganda content, it can be seen that we are running through a basic spirit in mass propaganda, that is, to cultivate and improve the people's anti-imperialist and patriotic internationalist consciousness, and to promote the people's high enthusiasm and creativity in labor production in order to continuously improve labor productivity and strive for consolidating national defense, developing the economy, defending the motherland, and defending world peace. At the same time, due to the personal reports made to the masses by leading cadres of the Party and government and the activities of propagandists scattered in various positions, a propaganda team combining leading backbones and broad activists has been formed, so that our mass propaganda work has gradually deepened, and the shortcomings of "generalized propaganda content" have been gradually overcome, and the ideological, authentic, specific, and combatant nature of propaganda work has begun to be strengthened.

In the future, under the general policy of "consolidating national defense and developing the economy," we must widely conduct current affairs propaganda among the people of all strata, continue to universally launch political movements against US aggression and aid to Korea, against the US rearming Japan, and to eradicate bandits and secret agents and suppress counter-revolutionary activities, encourage the people to build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force with selfless labor and courage, complete the national liberation, and be ready at any time to smash any provocations by the US aggressors and their running dogs against our country and consolidate our great motherland.

In industrial and mining enterprises, we should focus on publicizing the work of improving the business management of enterprises. Promote new technologies and advanced production experience (such as new coal mining methods, high-speed cutting methods, etc.), improve product quality, accelerate capital turnover, reduce product costs, and implement piece-rate wages in a step-by-step manner. Further give play to the production enthusiasm of the working class, and organize and lead the patriotic labor competition that has been widely launched well, so that it becomes a regular conscious movement of the working class to complete and exceed the production plan, and becomes an important way for the working class to participate in national defense construction and economic construction.

In terms of agricultural production, we should emphasize publicizing the vigorous development of agricultural production, especially the production of marketable grain and industrial raw materials, according to the new situation in rural areas. In southern Manchuria, more cotton, hemp, and various industrial raw materials and specialties can be planted. In northern Manchuria, more marketable grains such as wheat and soybeans and flax can be planted. In eastern Manchuria, more rice can be planted. In some pastoral areas in western Manchuria, cattle and sheep can be bred in large numbers. Eliminate farmers' ideological concerns about the sales channels, prices, and public grain conversion rates of marketable grain, and improve farmers' enthusiasm for production. Second, we must publicize the development direction of local industry and private industry facing the countryside, so that local industry and private industry can plan to manufacture production tools needed by farmers for expanded reproduction, and supply farmers with a sufficient number of standardized, strong, and durable iron, wood, leather, and hemp agricultural tools. The correct solution to this problem can not only meet the requirements of farmers to expand reproduction and promote the development of agricultural production, but also open up a larger market for the development of industry and commerce. Third, publicize the organized improvement of agricultural technology and increase investment in land, which is an important link in increasing unit yield. Attention should be paid to seizing one or two major events related to increasing farmers' income in a certain period of time according to the season and region, carrying out in-depth publicity, typical demonstration, and forming a broad mass movement to make improving agricultural technology the most effective way to complete production. Fourth, publicize the new content of organization, that is, expand the scope of labor mutual assistance, and add the contents of sideline occupations, handicrafts, transportation, etc.; organize funds to solve farmers' difficulties in production materials, improve agricultural technology, develop sideline occupations, organize a large number of women's labor force, and implement division of labor and industry where conditions permit in order to rationally use labor force and create wealth from all aspects and accelerate the rise of the rural economy. Fifth, publicize the further improvement and development of rural supply and marketing cooperatives, so that they can supply members with a large amount of production and living materials, promote the agricultural products of members, and develop rural credit undertakings to support the further development of agricultural production.

　　东北区建立宣传网的经验（三续）
      富振声
    第二、宣传党和人民政府的政策、决定以及人民群众的任务特别是当时当地的直接任务。
    政策是我们新民主主义国家的生活的基础。从党的各种政策上，可以看出我们建设新中国的方针和伟大的理想。宣传员的任务，就是通过口头的和文字的宣传，把党和政府的政策和决定传播到广大的人民群众中去，引导群众以实际行动来实现这些政策和决定，并引导群众以英雄主义的劳动态度，树立和提高新的劳动功勋。
    一年以来，在工矿企业生产中，随着生产运动的发展与要求，我们在宣传内容上着重宣传了开展生产竞赛、提高产品质量、提高劳动生产率，加强经营管理、团结职员技术人员及劳保福利等各种政策与决定，从而也就不断地提高了工人阶级的思想政治觉悟，发挥了工人群众的生产热情和创造性，巩固了工厂中的劳动纪律和生产秩序，使工人群众与职员和技术人员进一步团结了，劳动与技术密切结合了，因此使国家生产计划有了保证。
    在农业生产上，则着重宣传了恢复与发展农业、提高农业技术、改良品种深耕细作、加强换工互助，组织供销合作，合理负担以及巩固农村人民民主专政等各种政策与决定。从而也就不断提高了农民群众的政治觉悟，发挥了农民群众的生产积极性和创造性，巩固了农村人民民主专政，保证了农业生产计划的完成。
    各地宣传员在宣传党的政策决定以及人民群众的任务特别是当时当地的直接任务上，做了许多工作，他们能密切结合生产，具体解决群众顾虑，有力地推动了生产建设。
    鹤岗煤矿宣传员许铣民同志（应是报告员），在去年七月二十八日以“贯彻东北煤矿管理局实行新式采煤法的决定”为题，向全矿先进生产者，发表了谈话。
    首先他指出旧式采煤法对工人的害处。他说：“用这种办法（旧式的）采煤，使我们今年已死去十五个工人弟兄，其中有十四个人是“冒顶”死的，这是很痛心的事，是我们今后不能允许的，因为这是我们工人阶级自己的矿山，在这里干活的都是我们工人的兄弟。可是要根绝这种现象有什么办法？继续用日本人的旧办法吗？不行，因为我们十五个工友死去了！那么究竟用什么办法？肯定的说，只有贯彻新式采煤法，一二零掌子和一零三掌子试行的经验已证明了这一点，证明他不但可以避免危险，使我们生命得到可靠保证，同时还可减少体力劳动。”
    他继续讲到新式采煤法对国家有什么好处，他说：“以兴山矿为例，现在还有××吨的埋藏量，用旧办法最多可采出百分之三十到四十，但新式采煤法已使回采率（即采出煤的百分比）提高到百分之九十以上，这就是我们为什么要实行新式采煤法的原因。”
    最后，他的讲话联系到了国家利益和工人利益的一致，他说：“去年咱们矿山赔了××亿，原因是大家努力不够。今年不同了，仅上半年就给国家赚了七百六十三个亿。把去年赔的又挣回来了。由于大家发挥了主人翁的态度，以及苏联专家的帮助，使国家挣了钱，随着咱们的工资也平均增加百分之七，福利事情还不在内。现在矿局已决定拿出四十个亿给大家消灭臭虫，八月中旬大体完成；还准备二十个亿到天津买暖水壶，每人一个，八月份保证做到；并开始给大家修业余休养所。各位先进代表们！这就是说，只要国家赚了钱，我们工人的生活也就随之改善。最后，我希望在下半年内，再给国家赚一千亿，大家说好不好？”大家齐声说：“好！”问：“有没有信心？”大家充满信心地回答说：“有！”
    他的话给先进生产者以深刻印象。在休息时许多工人说：“现在国家都是为咱们着想呀！”由于这个讲话能把党和政府的政策和工人利益联系起来，这就使工人们能自觉地执行党和国家的政策。
    哈尔滨毛织厂宣传员郭淑琴同志，是个女工，支部宣传委员。当该厂去年十一月接受新任务后，车间各种定额也须要有所改变。但某些工友还不能从思想上立即接受这一新的定额，如一个老女工说：“这可干不了，一个人真站不起！”其他多数工友也说：“达不到定额，产量高，人又这么少……”对原来两人看一个案子现改一人看没信心。郭淑琴同志就针对这种思想向工人解释说：“如果咱们再照以前那样做，就达不到定额，新的任务还能完成吗？我们先照这样做，办法也靠大家想呵！现在是不熟悉，过几天就好了。这点困难我们要克服，前方战士比我们苦得多呀！”若干工友考虑了她的讲话，回答：“试试看”。不久，唐淑华、鞠秀兰工友一个人看案子达到了六尺，郭淑琴就在车间生产会议上宣传了这个事实，并用这个事实说明新定额是可以达到的，又组织人写稿在黑板报上表扬，这就影响与激发了每一个工友不甘落后的思想，发挥了新英雄主义，逐渐使每个工友都完成与超过定额，平均都达到四匹半（原来两人最高五匹）。十一月生产总结奖励大会上，整个车间十九名工友中有十二名得到奖励，郭淑琴同志想到要巩固已收到的成绩，就和其他宣传员想办法，通过车间工会召开了全车间的工友会议，郭淑琴同志进行鼓励说：“咱们车间这回十二个工友得奖，要保持下去这个光荣，没得奖的工友要好好学习，自己要努力下次好得奖，叫我们全车间都得奖，这就更光荣！争取模范车间！”在她这样鼓励之下，工友都表示：“争取在十二月都得奖，成为模范车间！”的确，在最近评选模范时，她们的车间已评为模范车间了。
    鞍山选矿厂选矿场车间，去年九月份未完成生产任务，当时最迫切的问题，是如何提高技术改进机器生产效能，提高产量的问题。但工人对改进破碎机的粒度有疑虑，认为“伪满日本鬼子多能耐，都没改进了，我们更是改进不了。”该场宣传员何国钊同志（技术员）在支部领导下，和另外几个宣传员进行研究，打通工人思想。后来终于研究成功，改进了粒度，提高了产量，在质量上也较以前稍有进步。到十一月份产量已能完成任务，但在质量上还达不到上级规定的精矿为百分之六十，尾矿为百分之十二的标准。而提高质量的关键是在选矿机，该厂的宣传员小组又专门进行了几次研究，找出了嗞选机质量低的原因是由于几位工友政治觉悟差，工作责任心不强，有的是因为技术差，不能很好的保磙皮调整电流和水平，找不准矿量，因而影响质量。于是宣传员们提出了“保磙皮，勤调整，尾十二，精六零”的口号，并在工人中进行耐心的教育，这样就使质量提高，达到了上级规定的标准。
    鞍山选矿厂宣传员金凤连同志，善于结合每一件平常的事情，宣传党和政府的政策，启发群众爱国主义思想。如该厂工人张启和，在七月时被装入机碰伤了，在家休养。金凤连同志就亲自到张家慰问。由于张是新工友，到厂内工作时间不久，不知道因公伤享有劳动保险待遇。张的父母因治病花了许多钱，正是十分忧虑。金凤连同志就向张启和和他的父母讲解了劳动保险条例，并说：“现在厂子和伪满及国民党时期，真是根本不一样了，受伤了有劳动保险条例，伪满和国民党时，你死了又有谁来管呢？”“现在国家可关心咱们啦，老工友身体不好还送去住休养所，老了有养老院。”张启和父亲激动地说：“东院伪满时有人住厂子，受了伤厂子就不要了，我活了这大年纪，头一次看到这样的政府，这样好的政策。”当金凤连离开时，张启和的父亲还不住的说：“我一定好好照顾启和养伤，伤好了好早上班生产。”
    辽东营口商家台村宣传员王维盛同志，对动员和推动该村备耕播种夏锄和秋收工作，都起了很大作用。他的宣传方法主要是通过黑板报（自己不识字，找别人写）。他紧紧结合中心工作，根据具体情况，写的生动，出的及时，内容丰富，颇得群众拥护。
    去年春脖短，在刨楂子时群众却有“等等不忙”思想，王维盛同志便写出：“别看地皮潮，裂缝就好刨！”并以本互助组刨楂子的样子来推动大家：“二闾互助十一家，男女老少打楂子，老太太纺线代看家！”在动员及时种棉花时提出：“湿刨干打不算差，赶快趟地种棉花！”在推广血粉拌种王铜消毒时，他又鼓动大家：“今年种地经验得的巧，血粉王铜拌不少，血粉拌种小苗好，王铜消毒乌米少！”在他的口号下，该互助组的种籽不仅全部进行了王铜消毒，而且还买了十三斤血粉拌种。在修河时他在出工修河的群众中宣传：“一不怕修河任务大，二不怕修河困难定能克服它，三不怕家里有事定有办法，四不怕雨多地荒互助起来力量大！”为了及时把洼地种上，他说：“别看时候早，洼地早种好，有风就有雨，来水种不了！”当普遍开铲的时候，他自己买红布做了一面旗，上写：“王维盛互助组锄草先锋大队”。经过他早下地晚回来带起附近群众都跟着他的红旗走，龚桂林、李长民等互助组，还有妇女组，看见红旗下地便喊：“走吧！红旗都下地了！”离红旗远的地方有儿童在屋顶广播：“红旗下地了，大家快下地吧！”这样全村有三百多人跟着他的红旗活动，推动全村做到四铲，除三亩地外，都做到四趟。当地里起害虫时，他的黑板报就及时写上：“眼见害虫起，男女互助抓虫子，害虫快抓净，到秋苗强多打粮！”并动员学生打鼓，用盒装着害虫，拿着被虫咬坏的高粱棵，到街上宣传，引起全村注意，掀起抓虫运动，每天有三百人下地，十天抓净了虫子。挂锄后，他又针对群众“歇伏”的习惯，提出：“互助防水垒高坝，免去庄稼受折磨。人人要想生活好，一定要把副业搞，青年人住矿山和盐滩，老人卖瓜好，妇女纺线代抱鸡，或到集上卖估衣。要想明年生活好，今年粪堆别让小。水热草嫩积粪好，水凉草老积不了，快快拔蒿草，过去时机拔不了，起早睡晚多垫圈，白天下地抓大草，野草拔净籽粒好。”到秋季，他说：“霜降树叶黄，庄稼上了场，粮食打满仓，感谢共产党。优属我当先，选好棉花籽，也能把钱卖，也能顶公粮。下地刨楂子，准备套犁杖。”在宣传抗美援朝时，他说：“共产党真正强，号召生产多打粮，种特产，把福享，抗美援朝正应当，买大布，做衣裳，穿上就不冷，出门也漂亮，来年更比今年强。”在宣传纳公粮时说：“为什么纳公粮，支援前线建工厂，前线吃饱打胜仗，工人吃饱机器响，造出农具好生产，造出枪炮送前方，国也富来民也强，美国侵略一定败。”在宣传出担架时说：“我们人民力量大，支援前线出担架，家中诸事不用挂，村政府里有办法，衣帽鞋袜准备好，跟随志愿大军去援朝，倘若战士挂了彩，担架同志好好抬，同志受伤痛声哀，好好安慰理应该，志愿援朝消灭美帝好，回来前方后方功不小。”宣传搞副业时说：“河水成冰天气寒，天寒不闲也赚钱，搞副业多生产，纺线编席又支前，有吃有穿打垮美帝国主义不会难。”
    黑龙江龙江县前平房村宣传员在动员春耕时，提出：“树叶发了青，不快种地就要扔。”肇东太平山村提出：“春雨贵如油，抢种就多收”为了防止“靠山?”“压沟子”“一犁挤”等粗草耕作现象，前平房村提出：“一犁一个挤，秋收少打粮，活活倾自己”，而后支部又编了顺口溜：“挤起来地发凉，不费劲，苗不旺，草先出，地就荒，不好铲，不好趟，费了不少劲，到秋少打粮，粮食不够吃，没钱买衣裳。”这个宣传，对群众教育很深刻，齐齐哈村一部分农民原来预定一犁挤，经过宣传后大部改为两犁扣。在提倡选种施肥上，拜泉新立屯提出：“到春多送三天粪，到秋多打三石粮”，洮南玉成村提出：“家家选种，户户开荒”，“选好籽种吃饱饭，老老少少一齐干”，结果，推动全村一四四户，有一二○多户选了种，八十多户做到发芽试种。对互助组的自愿两利政策上，龙江齐齐哈村以张永发不评分不两利的实例在群众中进行教育说：“齐齐哈，张永发，糊涂组，累死马，红了脸，吵了架。”结果影响不少小组重新评分记账。夏锄期间，太平山村地里的蒿子长的很高还未开铲，支部书记和村长两人（都是宣传员）便商量进行宣传工作，召开宣传员会议，发动全村开铲，提出：“早铲一日如上粪，晚铲一日累死人”，“多铲多趟多打粮，日子一定过的强”，并用放送筒表扬早开铲的叶文，向宣传员提出：“动员小组，带头开铲”，会后，又进行检查，发现有的带起来了，有的未带起来，就又表扬带起来的小组，这样连续宣传影响全村多数小组共七十多人下地开铲。肇州新隆村趟地缺马力，而各组马力不一，就提出：“你组多一匹，我组少一匹，插到一块就是一付趟犁”，“马力不要闲，插好才合算，趟地能及时，又能挣工钱。”这样有六个互助组剩余的马就套了两付趟犁，充分发挥了人力畜力的作用。拜泉进步村宣传员编顺口溜表扬两个参加夏锄的妇女：“苏桂珍真不善，领导妇女把工换，薅亚麻两垧半，谷子糜子一垧三，下雨天不消闲，领导妇女把粪拣。张淑芳作骨干，领导学习把报纸看，每天晚上念一遍，学习政策脑筋换，学办法得经验，学习生产把劲添，齐努力往前干，发家致富在眼前。”
    辽东岫岩洋河区朱家窑村马德廉同志，是个优秀的宣传员，从参加东北区第一届宣传员代表会议回家后，他积极进行宣传工作，当时该村正宣传有奖储蓄工作，他马上到闾上进行宣传，群众说：我们拿储蓄把国防建设好，不让美国鬼子再来侵略，储蓄钱三个月就还，还有奖，太好了。三天工夫，该村储蓄了六千多万元。春节快到的时候，群众要求在春节中演一些街头剧和时事快板、大鼓、小调等，他就编了个“撵走美国鬼”小调：“一、太阳一出照满天，咱们庆祝五一年，为了撵走美国鬼，支援战争到朝鲜！二、并肩作战弟兄帮，也为保卫咱边疆，生命财产不受损失，加紧生产建设国防。三、咱们国防建设强，前方后方有力量，世界和平有保证，那怕美国疯狂狼！”
    第三、宣传先进生产经验，鼓动人民积极完成任务。
    及时传播先进生产经验，对推动生产是有着重大作用的。去年在工业生产上，着重宣传了提高产品质量，加强生产责任制及改进技术等方面的经验。马恒昌小组和陈毓才车间的经验，由于各地宣传员的传播，他们的先进经验曾普遍到东北各厂矿，这无疑对加强生产责任制及提高产品质量，起了重大的推动作用。除此之外，各厂矿在传播各该地的生产经验上，也作了不少工作。如沈阳第一机器厂，第一季度制造出××台六尺全齿轮车床，都不合规格，受到上级批评，一般工人情绪低落，对完成四月份任务，信心不大。四月十九日该厂装出五台二级品车床，宣传工作者便立即抓住这一机会，画出一幅醒目的宣传画，标题为：《装成五台二级品车床，向一级品奋斗！》抬着这幅画游行全厂。工人知道车床合了规格，精神为之振奋，对完成四月份任务提高了信心。车工五组，二十二天完成全月任务，且无一废品，宣传工作者又抓住这一事例，及时进行宣传，给该组画了一幅写实的宣传画，描绘出他们提前完成任务的情形，同时发出生产号外，介绍他们提前完成任务的原因——是因为订立了小组计划。由于这个经验的传播，该厂五月底胜利地完成了××台标准品。
    第四、揭发生产和工作的缺点，与浪费国家财产的现象作斗争。
    随时随地注意巩固国家纪律与劳动纪律，是经常的宣传内容之一。
    鞍山机修厂，在去年一、二月间废品满地，工友互相推诿，无人负责，丢料现象随处发生，工人们随用随拿，坏了扔掉，扔了再拿。在三月中机器厂召开生产会议时，车工班长高富绵（党员）提出举办废品展览会，经过党、政、工、青的筹备，于五月五日正式举办了一个产品展览会。展览品中有废品，也有最好的，使好与坏之间有个比较。被展览的废品，拴一“飞子”，写上项目、组别、姓名、工薪等级、估价、原因等。这个展览会对提高质量减少废品起了极大作用，使产生废品的工人，受到很深刻的教育。有的参观到坏活的地方就不走了，左看右看，大家议论着，有的拿出尺比了又比量了又量，倒看他大多少小多少，车的时候是怎样下手的。在五天展览中，好多工友一有空就跑去研究，有的竟去了三、四次之多。有的说：“这次废品损失的材料，如投向我们国家的经济建设里，投向我们的福利事业里，它的效力该多大呀，这样无意的损失，多么可惜呀！”同时也引起大家研究防止出废品的办法。经这一教育之后，该厂铸造场到四月成品率达到百分之九六·四二，生产任务完成百分之一一六·二○机器场的铁床班，在四月份的七千多件活中，只两件废品，五月上旬，整个机器场的成品中只出现两件废品。
    沈阳第一机器厂第二制造厂铁工班，经常出废品，仅五月二十七日一天，就废了三十一件，影响装配，黑板报立即尖锐指出：“由于工作上的粗心大意，造成国家财产的浪费，是工人阶级的耻辱！”引起了铁工班的警惕，召开会议进行检讨，以后工作上有很大进步，从五月二十八日至六月七日只出了一件废品。
    鹤岗煤矿宣传员李树连同志，把矿山当作自己的家，对矿山器材特别爱护。当他看到填坑时把许多还能用的坑木都压到坑里了，就非常心痛。因此他就经常主动地向工友进行爱护国家财产的宣传，他说：“我们要把能用的坑木撤出来，使着又方便，还给国家节省了钱。”经他反复教育的结果，他们的小组每次填坑时一定把能使用的坑木都撤出来，给国家节省了许多钱。
    上述宣传内容，是一年来我们在群众宣传工作中比较注意的几个方面，因而也就使群众宣传工作有力地推动了国防建设与生产建设，有力地推动了各种人民群众的政治运动。
    从以上的宣传内容里，可以看出，我们在群众宣传中贯穿着一个基本精神，就是培养和提高人民群众的反帝国主义的与爱国主义国际主义的自觉，发扬人民群众高度的劳动生产的积极性和创造性，以达到不断的提高劳动生产率，为巩固国防、发展经济，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平而奋斗。同时也由于各地党政负责干部亲自向群众作报告以及散布在各种岗位的宣传员活动，形成领导骨干与广大积极分子相结合的宣传队伍，因而使我们的群众宣传工作逐渐深入下去，“宣传内容一般化”的缺点已在逐渐加以克服，宣传工作的思想性、真实性、具体性和战斗性已开始加强了。
    今后在“巩固国防、发展经济”的总方针下，我们要在各阶层人民群众中，广泛进行时事宣传，继续普遍展开抗美援朝反对美国重新武装日本及铲除土匪特务镇压反革命活动的政治运动，鼓舞人民群众以忘我的劳动和勇敢，建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量，完成全国解放，并随时准备粉碎美国侵略者及其走狗对我国的任何挑衅，巩固我们的伟大祖国。
    在工矿企业方面，应着重宣传改善企业的经营管理工作。推广新的技术与先进生产经验（如新式采煤法、高速度切削法等），提高产品质量；加速资金周转，减低产品成本；有步骤的推行计件工资。进一步发挥工人阶级的生产积极性，很好的组织与领导已经广泛开展起来的爱国主义的劳动竞赛，使之成为工人阶级为完成与超过生产计划的经常的自觉运动，成为工人阶级参加国防建设与经济建设的一种重要的方式。
    在农业生产方面，应根据农村的新情况，首先强调宣传大力发展农业生产，特别是商品粮及工业原料的生产。在南满可多种棉麻及各种工业原料和特产，在北满可多种小麦、大豆等商品性的粮食和亚麻，在东满可多种水稻，在西满某些有牧场的地方，可大量繁殖牛羊。打消农民对商品粮销路、价格、公粮折合率的思想顾虑，提高农民的生产积极性。第二、要宣传地方工业及私人工业面向农村的发展方向，使地方工业和私人工业有计划的制造农民为扩大再生产所需的生产工具，供给农民足够数量的、合乎规格的、结实耐用的铁木皮麻农具。这个问题的正确解决，不仅可以满足农民扩大再生产的要求，推动农业生产的发展，而且同时给工商业的发展开辟更大的市场。第三、宣传有组织的改进农业技术，增加土地的投资，这是提高单位产量的重要环节。应注意根据季节、地区的不同，在一定时期抓住该地有关增加农民收入的一两件大事，深入宣传，典型示范，形成一个广泛的群众运动，把改进农业技术作为完成生产的最有效的办法。第四、宣传组织起来的新内容。即扩大劳动互助的范围，把副业、手工业、运输业等内容加进去；组织资金，解决农民生产资料困难，改进农业技术，发展副业，大量组织妇女劳力，有条件的实行分工分业，以便合理使用劳动力，从各方面创造财富，加速农村经济的上升。第五、宣传进一步提高与发展农村供销合作社，使之能大量供给社员生产及生活资料，推销社员的农业产品，发展农村的信贷事业，以扶助农业生产的进一步发展。
