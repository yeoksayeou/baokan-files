The victory of the Chinese and Korean people is the victory of peace-loving people all over the world!
The Chinese and Korean People's Forces Victoriously Liberate Seoul

During the New Year's offensive launched on New Year's Eve 1950, the Chinese and Korean People's Forces broke through the enemy's defenses at multiple points along the 400-li front of the 38th parallel, encircling and annihilating the enemy, and pursuing them in victory. The picture shows the Chinese and Korean People's Forces occupying a pass along the 38th parallel. After entering Seoul through the Independence Gate, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army continued to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy. Seoul was finally liberated once again under the powerful offensive of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. The people of Seoul, who had been humiliated and exploited by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang, wiped away their tears and excitedly took to the streets to welcome the Chinese and Korean troops.

The Chinese People's Volunteers crossed snow-covered mountains and frozen rivers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in the bitter cold. This photograph shows the brave fighters advancing towards Seoul through deep snow.

The Korean people organized stretcher teams, fearlessly carrying the wounded soldiers of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces from the battlefield to the rear. They covered the soldiers with the only clothes and blankets they had left after being burned and looted by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang, with a kindness like a mother treating her children.

After the liberation of Seoul, the Korean people posted slogans reading "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people and the closest friend of the Korean people!" and "Long live the eternal and indestructible friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!" to welcome the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Seoul is liberated. The American emblem of the American Embassy, a symbol of American militarist aggression, lies on the side of the road, beaten like a festering sore; the portrait of MacArthur, torn to shreds by the angry Korean people, is trampled under the victorious footprints of countless Chinese People's Volunteers and Korean People's Army soldiers. This signifies the end of MacArthur and the Syngman Rhee gang's criminal rule, and the certain victory of the just war of the Chinese and Korean people against US imperialist aggression.

After the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army victoriously joined forces in front of the Syngman Rhee gang's puppet National Assembly building in Seoul, the commanders and fighters danced and sang in front of the building to celebrate their victory.

Whether in battle or at rest, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army demonstrated brotherly friendship. This Korean People's Army soldier is offering tobacco to a Chinese People's Volunteer soldier.

    中朝人民的胜利就是全世界和平人民的胜利！
    中朝人民部队胜利解放汉城
    中朝人民部队在一九五○年除夕展开强大的新年攻势，在“三十八度线”四百里的正面防线上多处突破缺口，分别包围歼灭敌人，乘胜追击。图为中朝人民部队占领了“三十八度线”的隘口。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军攻入汉城独立门后，继续追歼逃敌。汉城在强大的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的进攻下，终于再度获得解放。被美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮凌辱和压榨下的汉城人民，擦干了他们的眼泪，兴奋地跑到街头，欢迎中朝人民队伍。
    中国人民志愿军越过积雪重重的高山，跨过冰冻了的江河，在严寒的气候下，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，这张照片显示英勇的战斗员正在深雪中向着汉城前进。
    朝鲜人民组织了担架队，不避艰险地从战场上将负伤的中朝人民部队的战士陆续运到后方，把他们自己被美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮焚毁劫掠后所遗留的仅有衣服和绒毡，一层层地盖在战士们的身上，像母亲对待孩子般的亲切。
    汉城解放后朝鲜人民张贴写着“中国人民敬爱的领袖，我们朝鲜人民最亲密的朋友毛泽东主席万岁！”和“朝鲜人民和中国人民的永远不灭的亲善万岁！”的标语，欢迎中国人民志愿军。
    汉城解放了，遗留在汉城象征着美国军国主义侵略标志的美国大使馆底美国国徽，被打得像一个烂疮疤似的，躺在道路的一旁；被愤怒了的朝鲜人民所撕碎的麦克阿瑟的画像，踏上了无数中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的胜利脚印。这就是意味着麦克阿瑟和李承晚匪帮罪恶统治的末日和中朝人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义战争的一定胜利。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在汉城李承晚匪帮的伪国会大厦前胜利会师后，指战员们在大厦前跳舞、唱歌，庆祝他们的胜利。
    不论在战斗中和在休息时，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战士，都表现了兄弟般的友谊。这位朝鲜人民军战士正在把烟丝送给中国人民志愿军战士。
