    Suggestion to Expand the Salt Sales Organizations in Tangshan Special District
    To the Editor:
    The Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province has a population of more than 4.6 million, but the state-owned salt sales organizations are too few (the entire special district has only one branch company and two salt sales teams), and they are all located in larger towns (such as Tangshan City, Luan County), so farmers in mountainous areas lack salt. Especially during last year's pickle-making season, the entire special district experienced a widespread salt shortage (with the most severe shortages in the mountainous areas along the Great Wall, such as Changli and Funing counties), and salt prices also rose accordingly.
    It is now the season for farmers to make soy sauce, and salt is needed. We suggest that salt companies should appropriately increase the number of salt sales organizations or universally entrust cooperatives to sell salt on their behalf, according to the needs of various regions, in order to meet the needs of the masses.
                                   Industry and Commerce Section, Tangshan Special Administrative Office
     Editor's Note: Salt is one of the necessities of life for the masses. The China Salt Industry Corporation should accept the demands of the masses, expand the salt sales organizations in the Tangshan Special District, and increase the amount of salt allocated for sale.

### 建议扩大唐山专区的食盐销售机构

专栏：来信摘要

　　建议扩大唐山专区的食盐销售机构编辑同志：
    河北省唐山专区有四百六十多万人口，但国营销售食盐的机构太少（全专区只有一个支公司，和两个销盐小组），而且都设在较大的城镇（如唐山市、滦县），所以山地农民很缺盐吃。尤其在去年腌咸菜的季节，全专区差不多普遍闹盐荒（以沿长城山区如昌黎、抚宁等县为最严重），盐价也随着上涨。
    目前正值农民造酱季节，需要用盐。我们建议盐业公司应根据各地需要情况，适当地增设销盐机构或普遍委托合作社代销食盐，以满足群众的需要。
                                   唐山专署  工商科
     编者按：食盐是群众生活必需品之一。中国盐业公司应接受群众的要求，扩大唐山专区食盐销售机构，增加食盐的配售数量。
