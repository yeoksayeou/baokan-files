    Yihua Textile Factory Doctor Insulted Female Workers
    More Than Fifty Readers Wrote to This Newspaper, Advocating Severe Punishment for Guo Yueyu According to the Law
    Editor's Note: On the 4th of this month, this newspaper published the incident of Guo Yueyu, a doctor at the Yihua Textile Factory in the Fengfeng Mining Area of Hebei, insulting female workers, and the handling opinions put forward by relevant departments of the Central Government on this matter, which immediately attracted the attention of readers. As of the 7th, more than fifty readers had written to this newspaper, including workers, students, revolutionary soldiers, government cadres, and medical workers.
    Their letters unanimously expressed extreme indignation at Guo Yueyu's behavior, demanding that the government severely punish Guo Yueyu according to the law. Comrade Shi Yan from North China People's Hospital pointed out in his letter: "As a doctor in a people's enterprise, Guo Yueyu should understand the laws and decrees of the People's Government, but he knowingly violated them by raping a minor girl and causing a tragic stillbirth. Such lawless behavior cannot be tolerated. The court should severely punish such bad elements." Reader Zhu Pei from the Political Department of the North China Military Region wrote: "Guo Yueyu's behavior of raping a minor girl and killing an infant is too lightly punished with two and a half years of imprisonment; he should be severely punished, with a minimum of ten years imprisonment." Readers unanimously expressed sympathy and condolences to the insulted and harmed female worker Lian Jiping. Readers were very satisfied with the handling opinions put forward by the relevant departments of the Central Committee after investigating this matter.
    They highly praised Comrade Gao Fudong of the CCP Fengfeng Mining Area Committee for resolutely standing on the position of the working class and daring to fight against illegal phenomena, and they suggested that this newspaper should vigorously cultivate and enlighten everyone to establish this new society's new morality. Below are two letters from Feng Pei and others.

    益华纱厂医生污辱女工事件
    五十余读者致函本报  主张依法严惩郭月宇
    编者按：本月四日本报发表了河北峰峰矿区益华纱厂医生郭月宇污辱女工事件，及中央各有关部门对此提出的处理意见后，立刻引起读者的注意。截至七日止，写信给本报的读者不下五十余人。其中包括工人、学生、革命军人、机关干部和医务工作者。
    他们的来信一致对郭月宇的行为表示极端愤慨，要求政府对郭月宇依法加倍治罪。华北人民医院史岩同志的来信中指出：“郭月宇身为人民企业中的医生，对人民政府的法令是应该懂得的，但却明知故犯强奸未成年幼女，惨坠胎儿。这种目无法纪的行为是不能容许的。法院应对这种不良分子加以严惩。”华北军区政治部读者朱培来信称：“郭月宇这种强奸幼女杀害婴儿的行为，处两年半徒刑实在是太轻；应从严惩办，最少处十年以上徒刑。”对被侮辱与被损害的女工连吉平，读者们一致表示同情与慰问。读者对中央各有关部门对这件事调查后所提出的处理意见感到非常满意。
    对中共峰峰矿区党委会高福东同志坚决站在工人阶级的立场，勇于和不法现象作斗争的精神备加赞扬，他们并建议本报应大力培养并启发大家树立这种新社会的新道德。下面是冯培等两封来信。
