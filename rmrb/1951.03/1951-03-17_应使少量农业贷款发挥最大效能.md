    Efforts Should Be Made to Maximize the Effectiveness of Limited Agricultural Loans
    Currently, various regions are carrying out loan and fertilizer distribution campaigns in preparation for spring plowing. According to feedback from readers in various locations, this work has not received the attention it deserves in some areas. They have raised several points that are worth considering by relevant departments: First, banks and cooperatives in various localities should conduct thorough investigations into the needs of local farmers before issuing agricultural loans, such as what they need and how much, and then prepare materials according to the needs of the masses. Second, during the distribution process, it is necessary to earnestly mobilize farmers to conduct democratic evaluations to ensure that loans are truly used to solve farmers' production difficulties. Third, agricultural loans should absolutely avoid being distributed evenly, because once the funds are dispersed, their effectiveness is greatly reduced. In cases where universal demands cannot be met, it is essential to focus on providing key loans. Fourth, it is imperative to closely grasp the seasonality, because once the time has passed, issuing agricultural loans loses its significance. Fifth, after agricultural loans are issued, timely inspections should also be conducted to ensure that funds are used for their intended purpose; farmers who use them improperly should be given necessary education and appropriate handling.

    应使少量农业贷款发挥最大效能
    目前，各地正在进行贷款、贷肥，准备春耕运动。据各地读者反映，这一工作在有些地方尚未引起应有的重视。他们反映了几点意见，值得有关部门参考：第一、要求各地银行及合作社在发放农业贷款前，应深入调查当地农民的需要情况，如要什么，要多少，然后再根据群众需要准备实物。第二、发放中要认真发动农民进行民主评议，保证贷款真正能够用到解决农民的生产困难上。第三、农业贷款切忌平均分配，因为款子一分散，效用就很小。在不能满足普遍要求的情况下，必需掌握重点贷放。第四、必须紧紧掌握季节性，因为时间一过，发放农业贷款就要失去意义。第五、农业贷款发出后，还应及时进行检查，保证专款专用；对使用不当的农户，应给予必要的教育和适当的处理。
