The Second National Financial Conference in 1950 pointed out: "Since currency stabilization, new urban-rural relations have been established, agricultural production has gradually recovered, and farmers have gradually become wealthier. The conditions for developing rural financial work are in place." Therefore, it was decided that "in the future, inland provincial and county banks, in addition to performing currency management duties, must vigorously develop rural financial work to organize and adjust currency circulation" and that "provincial branches should focus on organizing and leading rural financial work to coordinate with the rapid recovery of agricultural production to reach pre-war levels." In order to carry out rural financial work, the Chahar Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China advocated private lending and concentrated idle funds into production. In mid-December of last year, it instructed all branches, sub-branches, and offices throughout the province to establish rural financial groups, conduct deposit and loan services according to the needs of the masses, promote prize-bearing savings, and issue small loans. Through the development of this business, state banks have established closer ties with the individual farmer economy. According to incomplete statistics from 21 counties and cities in the province, as of mid-January, 25 groups had been established, absorbing a total of 5.04 million yuan in currency deposits, 5.95 million yuan in value-guaranteed deposits, 14,160 catties of wheat in kind, one bolt of cloth, 230.58 million yuan in prize-bearing savings deposits, livestock insurance for 238 head, and redeemed 201 silver dollars and 26 taels of silver. The Zhangbei group alone, in six villages in the seventh district, absorbed a total of 5.39 million yuan in various deposits in 24 days from January 7th to 31st. A total of 159.64 million yuan was loaned to 408 households. Most of the loans were directed towards supporting mass production, with the proportion being: more than 70 percent for transportation and sales, slightly less than 28 percent for handicrafts such as rope making, oil, and flour mills, and 2 percent for other special expenses such as weddings and funerals.

The regulations for the term and interest rates for deposits and loans are: the term of deposit is chosen by the depositor, but the minimum term is half a month (prize-bearing savings are subject to the provisions of the deposit slip); the maximum term for loans does not exceed one and a half months. The deposit interest rate is: 1.8 percent per month for in-kind deposits and value-guaranteed deposits, and 2.4 percent per month for currency deposits. The loan interest rate is from 3 percent to 3.6 percent per month. The implementation of this business has had a great effect on alleviating the difficulties of the masses and supporting their production. Therefore, it has been warmly welcomed by the masses. For example, 17 households including Kang Fujia in Beijia Village, Yuxian County, borrowed money to buy 305 catties of hemp. Making ropes earns them 1,500 yuan per catty, which is 800 yuan more than making ropes for others. Therefore, they said, "The group came to our village to make loans, production is in our own hands, and we earn more money." Some people in Hunyuan County reflected, "It is really convenient for us to have financial groups come to the countryside to make loans. The procedures are simple, saving effort and trouble. Unlike before, you had to go to the district first, then to the city, and get a guarantor to travel back and forth for three or four days, and sometimes you couldn't even get a loan. Now people can deposit even if they have spare money, which earns interest and is insured."

The widespread development of rural financial services by financial groups has not only achieved results in supporting mass production, but has also promoted reasonable interest rates for private lending. According to a survey of 28 villages last year, private lending interest rates were generally 5 to 8 percent per month, and some were as high as 10 percent or more. However, due to the influence of the financial group's business, in some rural areas, the rates have gradually decreased, with the highest being only 4 percent.

In promoting this business, rural financial groups in various parts of the province first conducted extensive and in-depth publicity to the masses to dispel some doubts caused by unfamiliarity. This greatly helped in carrying out the business. In addition, mobilizing activists to lead the masses also played a significant role. For example, in Xinzhuang Village, Huailai, under the influence of the village head, public security officer, and party branch secretary, the masses deposited a total of more than 2 million yuan. This working method of the financial group provides a good example for carrying out rural credit work in various places and is worthy of promotion.

### 察哈尔省建立农村金融小组  扶植生产解除困难受到农民热诚欢迎

　　察哈尔省建立农村金融小组
    扶植生产解除困难受到农民热诚欢迎
    一九五○年第二届全国金融会议曾经指出：“自通货稳定以来，新的城乡关系建立，农业生产逐渐恢复，农民逐渐富裕，农村金融工作开展的条件已经具备。”因而决定了“今后内地省、县银行，除执行货币管理业务外，必须大力开展农村金融工作以组织和调整货币流通”，“省分行应以组织领导农村金融工作为主要工作，以配合迅速恢复农业生产，达到战前水平。”中国人民银行察哈尔省分行为了开展农村金融工作，提倡私人借贷，集中游资投向生产，曾于去年十二月中旬，指示全省各分、支行、处普遍成立农村金融小组，根据群众需要，举办存、放款等业务，并推行有奖储蓄，发放小额贷款。通过这一业务的开展，使国家银行与农民个体经济取得更密切的联系。据该省二十一个县、市不完整的统计，截至一月中旬，已成立了二十五个小组，共吸收了货币存款五百零四万元，保本保值存款五百九十五万元，实物存款小麦一万四千一百六十斤，市布一匹，有奖储蓄存款两亿三千零五十八万元，牲畜保险二百三十八头，并收兑了白洋二百零一元，色银二十六两。只张北小组，在七区六个村中，由一月七日到三十一日二十四天中，共吸收了各种存款即达五百三十九万元。共放款一亿五千九百六十四万元，借款者共四百零八户。放款大多投向扶植群众生产，其比重是：运销业占百分之七十强，手工业生产如打麻绳、油、粉坊等占百分之二十八弱，其他婚丧等特殊费用占百分之二。
    存放款的期限和利率的规定是：存款期限由存户自择，惟最低期为半个月（有奖储蓄按存单规定）；放款期限最长不超过一个半月。存款利率是：折实存款与保本保值存款为月息一分八厘，货币存款月息二分四厘。放款利率是：由月息三分到三分六厘。这一业务推行后，在解除群众困难和扶植群众生产上，都有很大效果。因而很受群众欢迎。如蔚县北吉家庄村康富家等十七户，贷款买麻三百零五斤、打麻绳每斤能赚一千五百元，比给别人打绳每斤多赚八百元。因此，他们说：“小组到俺村贷款，生产由自己掌握，赚的钱就更多了。”浑源县的群众有的反映说：“金融小组下乡放款，对我们真方便，手续简单，省力省事。不像以前那样，先到区，再进城，拉上保人往返三、四天，有时还借不上。现在人们有个闲钱也能存，又生利息又保险。”
    金融小组，广泛开展农村金融业务，不但在扶植群众生产上有了成绩，且对私人自由借贷的利率上，也促使走向合理。根据去年二十八个村的调查，私人借贷利息一般为月息五至八分，个别的曾高到十分以上。但目前若干农村因有金融小组业务的影响，逐渐下降，最高的仅四分息。
    该省各地农村金融小组在推行这一业务中，首先广泛向群众进行深入宣传，以解除若干因生疏而引起的疑虑。因而对开展业务的帮助很大。此外，发动积极分子带动群众，也有很大的作用。如怀来辛庄村在村长、公安员、党的支部书记等影响下，群众共存款二百余万元。这种金融小组的工作方法，提供给各地开展农村信贷工作以很好的榜样，值得推广。
