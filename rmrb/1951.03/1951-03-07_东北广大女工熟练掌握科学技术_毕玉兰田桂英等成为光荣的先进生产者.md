The female workers in the industrial and mining enterprises of Northeast China have made brilliant achievements in production and construction. Many female workers have skillfully or fairly familiarized themselves with technology. Among the female workers in Lüda City, 1,196 have mastered 35 types of heavy industrial technologies such as driving trains, using lathes, repairing ships, or sand casting, and 6,183 have mastered 14 types of light industrial technologies. The Fushun Mining Bureau has 814 female workers engaged in 39 types of technical work. In the railway sector, following female train drivers such as Tian Guiying and Wang Baohong, in August of last year, the Qiqihar and Jilin Railway Administrations saw the emergence of train attendant crews where women held positions such as passenger train conductor, freight train conductor, baggage clerk, and train attendant.

Female workers not only competently undertake their own work, but many have also become advanced producers beloved by everyone. Among the 3,583 advanced producers in Shenyang City, women account for 11 percent. The 35 female workers of the Jilin Provincial Ceramics Factory collectively created 47 new production records, and Bi Yulan, a female worker at the "53" Factory, set seven new records alone. Female train driver Tian Guiying, a national model worker representative, Zhao Guilan, a renowned model for protecting the factory, and Chang Yongfen, an advanced female textile worker, have become excellent role models in the eyes of the broad masses of female workers in Northeast China.

In the patriotic production competitions, female workers have highly demonstrated their labor enthusiasm and significantly improved production efficiency. The 399 female workers of the Rubber Factory No. 7, under the Northeast Light Industry Bureau, exceeded the quota for rubber shoe production by an average of about 20 percent per person per month in the competition from October to December last year. Since October of last year, when the Shenyang Nail Factory No. 3 formed a production shock brigade composed of 23 female workers to promote the competition throughout the factory, not only has it completed the production plan ahead of schedule every month, but it has also completed each emergency production task on schedule.

Due to their outstanding achievements in production, many female workers have been promoted to leadership positions. In Shenyang City, approximately 1,100 female workers have been promoted to administrative and trade union cadres in factories in the past year. In Lüda City, one female worker has been promoted to the position of production manager, seven as technical assistants, 81 as team leaders, and 1,178 as group leaders.

　　东北广大女工熟练掌握科学技术
    毕玉兰田桂英等成为光荣的先进生产者
    东北工矿企业中的女工，在生产建设中有辉煌的成就。很多女工已熟练地或相当熟悉地掌握了技术。旅大市女工中有一千一百九十六人掌握了驾驶火车、使用车床、修船或翻砂等三十五种重工业技术，有六千一百八十三人掌握了十四种轻工业技术。抚顺矿务局有八百十四名女工从事三十九种技术工作。在铁路部门，继田桂英、王宝鸿等女火车司机之后，去年八月间在齐齐哈尔和吉林铁路管理局又出现了客运车长、运转车长、行李员、列车员等职务皆由妇女担任的列车乘务组。
    女工们不但胜任地担当起自己的工作，而且有许多还成了人人爱戴的先进生产者。沈阳市三千五百八十三名先进生产者中，妇女即占百分之十一。吉林省营陶瓷厂三十五名女工集体创造了四十七种生产新纪录，“五三”工厂女工毕玉兰一人就连创了七次新纪录。出席全国劳动模范代表会议的女火车司机田桂英、著名护厂模范赵桂兰、先进纺织女工常永芬等人，更成为东北广大女工心目中的好榜样。
    女工们在爱国主义生产竞赛中，高度发挥了劳动热情，显著地提高了生产效率。东北轻工业管理局所属橡胶七厂三百九十九名女工，在去年十月至十二月的竞赛中，每人每月平均超过胶鞋产量定额的百分之二十左右。沈阳制钉三厂自去年十月由二十三名女工组成生产突击队推动全厂展开竞赛以来，不但每月提前完成生产计划，且如期完成了历次紧急生产任务。
    由于生产上的卓越成就，许多女工被提拔到领导工作岗位上去。沈阳市一年来约有一千一百名女工被提拔为工厂行政和工会的干部。旅大市女工被提拔为生产管理工作者和技术干部的有职长一名，技术助理七名、班长八十一名和组长一千一百七十八名。
