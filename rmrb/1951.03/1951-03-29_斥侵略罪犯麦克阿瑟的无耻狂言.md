　　Condemning MacArthur's Shameless and Arrogant Utterances as an Aggressor
    The aggressor and criminal MacArthur issued an extremely arrogant statement in Tokyo on March 24, openly threatening to expand the war to Chinese territory. This enemy of peace-loving humanity actually said: "Red China faces the immediate risk of military collapse if the United Nations decides to alter its tolerant effort to confine the war to Korea and extend our military operations to its coastal areas and inland bases." All our compatriots must not forget this shameless statement by MacArthur, which insults the People's Republic of China, because this statement thoroughly exposes the heinous and aggressive nature of American imperialism and once again proves that the American aggressors are the sworn enemies of the Chinese people.
    The joint declaration of the Chinese parties on November 4, 1950, pointed out that "the purpose of the American imperialists in invading Korea is mainly not for Korea itself, but to invade China, as the Japanese imperialists did in the past." Heads of the American government, such as Truman and Acheson, and their accomplices, have tried their best to conceal the essence of this aggressive plan of the American government. However, MacArthur's statement on March 24 thoroughly exposed the mask of the American aggressors.
    MacArthur actually clamored to attack China by force, which clearly shows the extent of the American aggressors' madness. However, MacArthur's shameless and arrogant utterances, apart from further arousing the anger of the Chinese people and further enhancing the Chinese people's vigilance and sacred determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country, will of course have no other result.
    In his statement, in addition to clamoring for an attack on China, MacArthur fabricated a lot of lies about the Korean war situation. He vigorously boasted about the "development of large-scale destructive methods" of the American aggressor army, and boasted about "the importance and decisive role of sea and air control," and so on. MacArthur's lies are completely absurd and unfounded.
    In fact, the myth about the American navy and air force has already been completely bankrupt in the Korean War. An article by the US Air Force Secretary Finletter, published in the February 26th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, clearly admitted: "The U.S. Air Force cannot completely cut off the communist supply line from the rear to the front." Even MacArthur himself admitted in a press conference on December 3 last year that air support "can only be an auxiliary force, not a decisive force," and that "the navy's bombardment capability is narrowly limited to the border of the coast and cannot reach the main battlefield. Under such circumstances, the ground forces become the main factor." The reason why MacArthur is now picking up this bankrupt myth again is to distort the significance of the Chinese and Korean People's Army's initiative to withdraw from Seoul and to incite the desire of the American war-mongers to expand the war. But MacArthur's lie can't fool anyone. People still clearly remember that just before MacArthur issued this statement, on March 7, the same MacArthur issued a statement on the Korean war situation saying: "In such a war of attrition, as our army (referring to the American aggressor army) moves north, the enemy's (referring to the Chinese and Korean People's Army) supply lines will gradually shorten, thus making the quantitative advantage of their ground forces more and more significant on the battlefield. ... If our army (referring to the American aggressor army) moves forward again in the future, then the extent to which this action is militarily beneficial to the enemy (referring to the Chinese and Korean People's Army) will be greater than to our army." Then, on March 16, the day after the Chinese and Korean People's Army withdrew from Seoul, MacArthur, in his letter to Syngman Rhee, still had to admit that the fall of Seoul, "from a military point of view, is only an accidental event in the war, which has only an indirect relationship to the basic strategy." He believed that "the enemy's defending forces in this withdrawal were different from the situation in September (referring to the withdrawal of the Korean People's Army in September last year), and did not suffer a decisive defeat." But only eight days later, MacArthur began to brag, thinking that the initiative withdrawal of the Chinese and Korean People's Army was due to the "decisive role" of the American navy and air force, and because they could not "maintain the battle." Isn't MacArthur's absurdity very clear from here?
    MacArthur has long been notorious in the Korean War for his shameless boasting and lying. The history of the Korean War is full of records of MacArthur's bragging collapsing. Here are two typical examples. When MacArthur commanded the American aggressor army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army to launch the so-called "total offensive to end the war" on November 24 last year, he boasted in his offensive "communiqué": "The United Nations' massive compression and encirclement operation against the new Red Army fighting in North Korea is now approaching its decisive effort. ... If this offensive is successful, it can actually end the war." He also personally told General Coulter, commander of the Ninth Army of the US invading Korea: "Tell the officers and soldiers that they can return home after fighting to the Yalu River. I hope my words can be fulfilled, that is, they can go home for Christmas." (United Press International, Tokyo, November 24) But after this offensive was quickly crushed by the Chinese and Korean People's Army, he hurriedly denied his own words on November 28, saying that "he never seriously intended to give people the hope that the US military would return home for Christmas," saying that "at any time, I have never attempted to predict the progress or end of this or any other military campaign" (United Press International, Washington, November 29). After the Chinese and Korean People's Army ended the New Year offensive to liberate Seoul in early January this year, MacArthur, who had taken a breath, issued a statement in Korea on January 20, bragging: "This headquarters intends to maintain a military position in Korea for as long as the politicians of the United Nations decide to keep us there." Then, the American aggressor army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army launched a new offensive on January 25. However, after the Chinese and Korean People's Army launched a strong counterattack in the Hengcheng area on February 11, causing heavy losses to the enemy, MacArthur changed his tone on February 13 and said: "The view that we can cross Korea to establish a line and conduct positional warfare is completely unrealistic and illusory." MacArthur slapped himself in the face again here. As for MacArthur's ability to lie by deliberately distorting the truth of the war, it is also well known. The British and French bourgeois newspapers have long openly accused MacArthur's headquarters of "terrible distortions" and "absurd" fabrications about the Korean war.
    The American aggressors have suffered serious defeats in the Korean War and are destined to suffer complete defeat, which cannot be concealed by any bragging and lies. The Chinese people and the Korean people are united and have the power to completely defeat the American aggressors and liberate the whole of Korea. This power cannot be stopped by any sea and air control. The Chinese people did not have air or sea control during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, but the Chinese people finally defeated Japanese imperialism; in the People's Liberation War, the Chinese people did not have air or sea control, but the Chinese people still defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries fully supported by American imperialism. Since the Chinese people were confident in defeating Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, today they are equally confident in defeating the American aggressors together with the Korean people.

### 斥侵略罪犯麦克阿瑟的无耻狂言

　　斥侵略罪犯麦克阿瑟的无耻狂言
    侵略罪犯麦克阿瑟在三月二十四日在东京发表了一个极端狂妄的声明，公然威胁要把战争扩大到中国领土。这个和平人类的公敌竟说：“如果联合国决定改变它为了把战争限制在朝鲜境内而作的容忍的努力，把我们的军事行动扩展到他的沿海区域与内地基地的话，赤色中国就必定有立即发生军事崩溃的危险。”我国全体同胞都不要忘记麦克阿瑟的这个侮辱中华人民共和国的无耻的声明，因为这个声明彻底暴露了美帝国主义的穷凶极恶的侵略面貌，又一次证明了美国侵略者是中国人民的死敌。
    中国各党派在一九五○年十一月四日的联合宣言中就指出，“美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的目的，主要地不是为了朝鲜本身，而是为了要侵略中国，如像日本帝国主义者过去所做过的那样。”美国政府的首脑人物杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流及其帮凶曾经极力掩饰美国政府的这个侵略计划的实质。但麦克阿瑟三月二十四日的声明却彻底揭穿了美国侵略者的假面具。
    麦克阿瑟竟然公开叫嚣要武力进攻中国，这就清楚说明了美国侵略者已疯狂到什么程度。但是麦克阿瑟的这种无耻狂言，除了更加激起中国人民的愤怒，更加增强中国人民的警惕和抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣决心以外，当然不会有别的结果。
    麦克阿瑟在他的声明中，除了叫嚣进攻中国以外，还对朝鲜战局捏造了一大堆谎话。他大肆吹嘘美国侵略军“大规模毁灭的方法的发展”，吹嘘“制海权、制空权的重要性与决定作用”，等等。麦克阿瑟的这些谎话是完全荒唐无稽的。
    实际上，关于美国海、空军的神话，是早已在朝鲜战争中彻底破产了的。今年二月二十六日《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志发表的美国空军部长芬立脱的文章，曾明白承认：“美国空军不能完全切断共产党从后方通向前线的补给线。”甚至麦克阿瑟在去年十二月三日的一次答记者问中也承认：空军的支援，“只能作为一个辅助的力量，而不能作为一个具有决定性的力量”，而“海军的轰击能力也仅能狭隘地限于海岸的边界，不能达到主要的战场上。在这种环境之下，地面部队就成为主要的因素。”麦克阿瑟现在之所以又捡起这个已经破产的神话来，其目的就是为了歪曲中朝人民部队主动从汉城撤退的意义，和煽动美国战争贩子们扩大战争的欲望。但是麦克阿瑟的这个谎言是骗不了任何人的。人们还清楚记得，仅仅在麦克阿瑟发表这次声明以前不久，在三月七日，同一个麦克阿瑟还发表对于朝鲜战局的声明说：“在这样一种引诱战中，随着我军（指美国侵略军）战线的北移，敌军（指中朝人民部队）的补给线将逐渐缩短，因而使他们的地面部队的数量上的优势在战场上的意义越来越大。……今后我军（指美国侵略军）如再前进的话，那么这种行动在军事上对敌军（指中朝人民部队）有利的程度，将比对我军为甚。”接着，在三月十六日，即中朝人民部队撤出汉城的第二天，麦克阿瑟在他给李承晚的信中，还不能不承认汉城的易手，“由军事观点上看来，这不过是战事中的一个偶然事件，对于基本的战略，仅有间接的关系而已。”认为“这次撤退的敌方守军，不同于九月那时的情形（按指去年九月朝鲜人民军的撤退），并没有遭受决定的失败。”但从那时仅仅隔了八天，麦克阿瑟就吹起牛皮来了，就认为中朝人民部队的主动撤退是因为美国海空军的“决定作用”，是因为不能“维持战斗”了。麦克阿瑟的荒唐无稽从这里不是可以看得很清楚吗？
    麦克阿瑟在朝鲜战争中是早已因厚颜无耻地吹牛和撒谎而恶名昭著的。朝鲜战争的历史中充满了麦克阿瑟的牛皮破产的记录。下面就是两个较典型的例子。麦克阿瑟在去年十一月二十四日指挥美国侵略军和李承晚匪军发动所谓“结束战争的总攻势”时，曾在其攻势《公报》中狂言：“联合国对在北朝鲜作战的新的赤色军的庞大压缩与包抄行动现正接近它决定性的努力。……如果这个攻势获得胜利，实际上就可结束战争。”他并亲自对侵朝美军第九军军长古尔特说：“你告诉官兵们说，他们打到鸭绿江之后便可以回国了，我希望我的话可以兑现，就是他们可以回家过圣诞节。”（美国合众社东京十一月二十四日电）但在这个攻势很快被中朝人民部队粉碎以后，他又赶忙于十一月二十八日否认他自己的话，说“他从未认真地打算给人以美军在圣诞节前回家的希望”，说“在任何时候，我从未企图预言这个或任何其他军事战役的进程或结束”（美国合众社华盛顿二十九日电）。在中朝人民部队在今年一月初旬结束了解放汉城的新年攻势以后，稍稍喘了一口气的麦克阿瑟就又于一月二十日在朝鲜发表声明吹牛说：“本司令部打算在朝鲜保持一个军事阵地，联合国的政治家们决定要我们保持多久，我们就保持多久。”接着美国侵略军及李承晚匪军就于一月二十五日发动了新攻势。但在中朝人民部队于二月十一日在横城地区举行强大反击，使敌人遭受重大损失后，麦克阿瑟就又于二月十三日改变口气说：“认为我们可以横越朝鲜建立一条战线并进行阵地战的见解，是完全不合现实的而且是虚妄的。”麦克阿瑟在这里又狠狠地打了自己一耳光。至于麦克阿瑟故意歪曲战争真相的撒谎本领，也是为人所熟知的。英法资产阶级的报纸早已公开指责过麦克阿瑟总部对朝鲜战况所作的“可怕歪曲”和“荒唐”的捏造了。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中，已遭受了严重的失败，并且注定了要遭受完全失败，这绝不是任何牛皮和谎言所能掩饰得了的。中国人民和朝鲜人民联合在一起，完全有力量彻底战胜美国侵略者，解放全朝鲜，这种力量也绝不是什么制海权、制空权所能阻挡得了的。中国人民在八年抗日战争中，并没有制空权、制海权，但中国人民却终于打败了日本帝国主义；在人民解放战争中，中国人民也没有制空权、制海权，但中国人民仍然打败了美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动派。中国人民过去既然有把握战胜日本帝国主义和国民党反动派，今天就同样有把握和朝鲜人民在一起战胜美国侵略者。
