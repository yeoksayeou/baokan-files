Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th: The spokesperson of the Chinese People's Volunteers recently issued a statement regarding the US aggressor troops' crimes of using poison gas bombs, stating: The various inhuman crimes committed by the US aggressor troops on the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, such as indiscriminate bombing and shelling of peaceful villages and towns, the mad slaughter of peaceful men, women, and children, and the beastly violation of the old, the young, and women, are facts known to the world and undeniable.

The spokesperson stated: In recent months, the unjust war of aggression against Korea launched by the US aggressor troops has suffered repeated and heavy defeats, and the barbaric and cruel behavior of the US aggressor troops has become even more intensified. They not only more brutally destroy Korean towns and slaughter Korean peaceful residents, women, and children, but also, in their anger and shame, blatantly violate international law, collectively shooting captured personnel of our People's Volunteers on the battlefield; following this, they used asphyxiating poison gas bombs, attempting to poison Chinese People's fighters who are fighting for anti-aggression and for peace. At 4:00 PM on December 1, 1950, troops belonging to the 2nd Division of the US aggressor army collectively massacred 31 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and 35 peaceful residents of Korea in Jungseo-ri, Gacheon County, South Pyongan Province. The spokesperson of the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army issued a statement on February 18 of this year, denouncing the desperate and brutal act of the US military in killing our captured personnel. The US aggressor troops, who are addicted to killing, disregard the opposition of peace-loving people around the world and are now repeatedly using poison gas bombs on the Han River front. The above series of crimes committed by the US aggressor troops fully exposes that the US aggressor troops are the most brutal and barbaric army in the world today, murderers who inherit the mantle of the Hitler gang and Japanese fascists.

The spokesperson continued: After the crime of the US aggressor troops repeatedly using poison gas bombs on the Han River front was announced to the people of the world, officials of MacArthur Headquarters and Far East Air Force Headquarters of the US aggressor troops shamelessly denied the inhumane and illegal crimes they committed on March 5. However, how can they deny the monstrous crimes they have committed? Isn't the fact clearly laid out? On February 23, 26, and March 3, the US aggressor troops used poison gas bombs and shells four times in a row on the Han River front. The day after the officials of MacArthur Headquarters issued a statement of denial, the US aggressor troops released two poison gas shells in the Gu-ri-dong area on the Han River front. The irrefutable facts cannot be denied by the garrulous American aggressors.

The spokesperson said: The US aggressors' denial of the crime of using poison gas bombs not only proves that they are blood-stained butchers, but also proves once again that they are shameless liars. People know that the US aggressive air force constantly intrudes into the airspace of Northeast China to bomb and strafe, provocative behavior, and the US military authorities and the government also tried to deny it plausibly? However, the facts can never be covered up by any smoke screen of lies.

The spokesperson finally said: The crimes committed by the US aggressors in Korea are extremely serious, and they have aroused the resolute opposition of the Korean-Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and they will eventually be justly punished by the people. The Korean-Chinese People's Army is continuing to heavily strike this group of mad beast armies on the Korean battlefield, and the tide of the world people's peace movement is also rising higher and higher. This wave will submerge any war-mongering aggressors. The US aggressors—the common enemy of the peace-loving people of the world—are beginning to panic in the face of this overwhelming wave of the people's peace movement. This is why the US aggressor troops want to deny their use of poison gas bombs this time. The Chinese People's Volunteers will never forgive these bloodthirsty butchers and are determined to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to the end, until all the aggressor troops on Korean soil are completely and thoroughly eliminated, and the perpetrators of poison gas crimes will be captured and severely punished.

　　中国人民志愿军发言人发表谈话
    严斥侵朝美军使用毒气
    决不饶恕血腥屠夫定将捉拿严予惩办
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】中国人民志愿军发言人顷就美国侵略军使用毒气炸弹罪行发表谈话称：美国侵略军在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领土上所犯的种种惨无人道的罪行，例如滥施炸射和平乡村和城镇，疯狂屠杀和平男女居民和兽性般的蹂躏老幼妇女，已为举世皆知、无可抵赖的事实。
    发言人称：最近几个月以来美国侵略军发动的非正义的侵朝战争接连遭到惨重挫败，美国侵略军的野蛮残暴的行为更变本加厉。他们不仅更加残暴地毁灭着朝鲜的城镇和屠杀着朝鲜的和平居民、妇女和儿童，且恼羞成怒，悍然破坏国际公法，在战场上集体枪杀我人民志愿军被俘人员；继之，又使用窒息性毒气炸弹，妄图毒害我为反侵略、为和平而战的中国人民战士。一九五○年十二月一日午后四时，美国侵略军第二师所属部队在朝鲜平安南道价川郡中西里曾以机枪将中国人民志愿军的三十一名被俘人员和朝鲜的三十五名和平居民集体残杀。朝鲜人民军最高司令部发言人曾于本年二月十八日就此事发表声明，痛斥美军此种残杀我被俘人员的绝望的残暴行为。嗜杀成性的美国侵略军竟不顾世界爱好和平人民的反对，现又在汉江前线一再使用毒气弹。美国侵略军所犯的上述一连串罪行，充分暴露了美国侵略军是现在世界上最残暴、最野蛮的军队，是继承希特勒匪帮和日本法西斯衣钵的杀人犯。
    发言人接着说：当美国侵略军在汉江前线一再使用毒气弹的罪行向全世界人民公布后，美国侵略军麦克阿瑟总部官员及远东空军司令部官员竟于三月五日厚颜无耻地抵赖自己所干的非人道、非法的罪恶勾当。然而他们所干的滔天罪行，怎么能抵赖得了呢？事实不是明明白白地摆着吗？在二月二十三日、二十六日、三月三日，美国侵略军曾经连续四次在汉江前线使用毒气炸弹和炮弹，就在麦克阿瑟总部官员发表抵赖声明的后一日，美国侵略军又在汉江前线九里洞地区施放毒气炮弹两枚。确凿的事实是哓舌的美国侵略者所不能抵赖得了的。
    发言人说：美国侵略者抵赖使用毒气弹罪行这件事，不仅证明他是一个双手染满鲜血的屠夫，也再次证明了他是一个无耻的撒谎者。人们都知道美国侵略朝鲜的空军不断侵入中国东北领空轰炸扫射的挑衅行为，美国军事当局及政府不是也曾振振有辞地企图抵赖过吗？然而事实是决不能为任何谎言的烟幕所掩盖得住的。
    发言人最后说：美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯的罪行是深重极了，它已激起朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对，它终将受到人民的正义的惩罚。朝中人民军队正在朝鲜战场上继续沉重地打击着这群发疯的兽军，而全世界人民和平运动的浪潮也越来越加高涨。这个浪潮将淹没任何发战争狂的侵略者。美国侵略者——世界和平人民的共同敌人，在这种排山倒海的人民和平运动的巨浪面前开始发慌起来了。这就是美国侵略军这次为什么要抵赖自己使用毒气炸弹的原因。中国人民志愿军决不饶恕这些血腥的屠夫，决心与朝鲜人民军并肩作战到底，直至把朝鲜土地上的侵略军全部彻底干净消灭，并将捉拿放毒罪犯，严予惩办。
