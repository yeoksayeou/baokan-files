To the Editor:

　　The Wuhan Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education and the Hubei Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education slight trade union work and do not conscientiously implement the Trade Union Law. After the promulgation of the Trade Union Law on June 28th last year, the Wuhan Municipal Education Trade Union sent several copies of the Trade Union Law to the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, hoping that they would implement it in accordance with the law. Until September of last year, when the trade union requested the administration to allocate trade union funds in accordance with the law, the Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education repeatedly delayed, citing that they had received instructions from higher authorities. Later, with the assistance of trade union cadres and relevant agencies such as the Education Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, a portion of the trade union funds was received in December of last year; however, the trade union funds for August and September that should have been allocated by the Bureau of Culture and Education have not yet been allocated.

　　In October of last year, when teachers in various schools in the Wuyang District adjusted their wages, individual administrative cadres in some schools did not grasp the principles of wage adjustment well, causing dissatisfaction among the teachers in training. In November, based on the reports of the teachers in training, the Municipal Education Trade Union instructed the trade unions of the respective schools to study and handle the matter. Due to the imperfect trade union organizations in the schools and the unwillingness of the school administrative leaders to humbly examine themselves, the problem has not been resolved. At the end of December, the Municipal Education Trade Union and the Bureau of Culture and Education jointly discussed and determined a solution, and contacted the Provincial Department of Culture and Education eight or nine times by means of oral communication, telephone, and written correspondence, but the problem has still not been resolved by the end of February this year.

　　During the winter vacation last year, the Department of Culture and Education stipulated that teachers should study for eight hours a day. The Municipal Education Trade Union believed that the time was too long and suggested amendments, but no reply has been received.

　　In October of last year, after the Municipal Education Trade Union convened a representative meeting, it clarified the principle that the trade union should be "oriented towards teaching." In order to closely coordinate trade union work with the administration, the trade union has made several suggestions to the Bureau of Culture and Education, hoping that the trade union could send representatives to attend the bureau affairs meetings in order to understand the work situation. However, the trade union only occasionally received meeting notices a few times. These situations show that the Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education do not attach enough importance to the opinions of the trade union.

　　Article 11 of the Trade Union Law stipulates: "If the administrative side or the capitalist wants to transfer or dismiss members of the trade union committee elected by the masses, it must first obtain the consent of the trade union committee and then transfer it to the superior trade union committee for approval before it can be implemented." However, at the beginning of this semester, when the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education transferred Wu Zhong, the chairman of the Wuhan No. 2 Middle School Trade Union, to work in the bureau, neither the school administration nor the Bureau of Culture and Education consulted with the trade union. After the Municipal Education Trade Union learned about this, it contacted the Personnel Office of the Bureau of Culture and Education. Although the Personnel Office verbally promised to study it, it still transferred Wu Zhong afterwards. The same situation also occurred in the Provincial Department of Culture and Education. For example, when transferring Zhou Dangdao, a member of the trade union of the Provincial Wuchang No. 1 Middle School, the school administration and the Department of Culture and Education did not seek the consent of the trade union.

　　The Hubei Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's neglect of trade unions and failure to implement the Trade Union Law is detrimental to the educational work in Wuhan. It is hoped that the relevant leadership will pay attention to it. At the same time, the Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education should also conduct ideological self-examination, study and conscientiously implement the Trade Union Law.

### 湖北省文教厅和武汉市文教局  忽视工会法的执行

　　湖北省文教厅和武汉市文教局
    忽视工会法的执行编辑同志：
    武汉市人民政府文教局和湖北省人民政府文教厅轻视工会工作，不认真执行工会法。去年六月二十八日工会法颁布以后，武汉市教育工会曾分别送给市文教局和省文教厅数本工会法，希望他们依法执行。直至去年九月，工会要求行政依法拨交工会经费时，省文教厅和市文教局均借口又有接到上级指示，一再推拖。后来，经工会干部，又经中南军政委员会教育部等有关机关协助解决，到去年十二月才拿到一部分工会经费；而文教局应拨的八、九两月工会经费至今仍未拨交。
    去年十月，武阳区各校教员调整工资时，个别学校行政干部对调整工资原则掌握不够好，引起轮训教员的不满。十一月，市教育工会根据轮训教员的报告，指示各该校工会研究办理。由于学校工会组织不健全，学校行政负责人也不肯虚心检讨，问题一直得不到解决。十二月底，市教育工会曾与文教局，共同商定了解决办法，复以口头、电话、书面等方式和省文教厅进行八、九次联系，直到今年二月底，问题仍未获得解决。
    在去冬寒假期间，文教厅规定教员每天学习八小时，市教育工会认为时间太长，建议修正，但一直也没有得到答复。
    去年十月，市教育工会召开了代表会议以后，明确了工会应该“面向教学”的方针。为了使工会工作密切配合行政，工会曾几次向文教局建议，希望能允许工会派代表列席局务会议，以便了解工作情况。但后来工会只偶尔接到过几次开会的通知。以上这些情况，说明省文教厅和市文教局对工会的意见是不够重视的。
    工会法第十一条规定：“行政方面或资方，如调动或解雇由群众所选出之工会委员会的委员时，须事先取得各该工会委员会之同意，并由该委员会转请上级工会委员会批准后，方得实行之。”但这一学期开始，市文教局调武汉市第二中学工会主席吴忠去局工作时，学校行政和文教局都没有和工会商量。市教育工会知道后，曾和文教局人事室联系，当时人事室虽口头答应可以研究一下，可是事后仍把吴忠调走了。同样的情况，在省文教厅方面也发生过。如调动省立武昌第一中学工会委员周当道时，学校行政和文教厅也未征求工会同意。
    湖北省文教厅和武汉市文教局这种不重视工会，不执行工会法的情形，对武汉市的教育工作是不利的。希望有关领导方面能加以注意。同时省文教厅和市文教局也应从思想上进行检查，好好学习和认真执行工会法。
