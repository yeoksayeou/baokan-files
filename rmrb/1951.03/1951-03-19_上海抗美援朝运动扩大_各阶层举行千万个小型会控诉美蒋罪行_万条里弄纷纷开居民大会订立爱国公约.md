Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th - The people of all circles in Shanghai are enthusiastically responding to the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the call of the China Peace Committee, continuing to expand and deepen the great patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. More than one million people in Shanghai have participated in demonstrations against the United States rearming Japan, especially the massive demonstrations of 660,000 workers on March 4th and 300,000 women on "March 8th" International Women's Day; even vendors, shanty dwellers, priests, nuns, and elderly people in their eighties and nineties, who never cared about politics, have joined the ranks of the march. All sectors of the city have held millions of small meetings to accuse U.S. imperialism of its crimes of aggression and the crimes of the U.S. running dog Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in persecuting the people. More than 820 representatives of all sectors of the city held a meeting at the end of February against the United States arming Japan, and adopted a common patriotic pledge for the people of all circles. Twenty industrial trade unions and thousands of grassroots trade unions in the city have signed patriotic pledges. Government agencies, organizations, schools, and stores have also formulated more specific patriotic pledges.

　　A patriotic production competition is unfolding among the broad masses of workers. More than 300 worker groups in the city have responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group in Northeast China. The production achievements of the labor model groups such as Hang Peilan and Jin Longshan have already met or exceeded the conditions of the challenge. In the production competition, hardware, textile and other factories have generally improved product quality and continuously created new national records. The product conformity rate of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant recently reached 99.7 percent.

　　The most prominent manifestation of the city's industrial and commercial circles in fulfilling their patriotic pledges is to hold collective tax payments and demonstrations against the United States rearming Japan by district. At present, the vast majority of industrial and commercial households in the city have collectively paid their February business tax, of which no households in the three districts of Lao Zha, Yangjing, and Yangsi have evaded or defaulted on taxes. Among the 350 tax-paying groups in Zhabei District, 166 groups paid their taxes early. After paying their taxes, the taxpayers of the Sixth Tax Collection Group in Changshu District wrote to the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai, initiating a patriotic tax-paying competition.

　　More than 10,000 neighborhoods in the city have held or are holding residents' meetings to accuse U.S. imperialism of its crimes and have signed patriotic pledges. In the two districts of Songshan and North Sichuan Road alone, residents of 400 neighborhoods have formulated patriotic pledges. Residents also actively expose hidden special agents and bandits. In Lao Zha District alone, more than 300 special agents have been exposed by residents. More than 100,000 residents who participated in the "Winter Defense Service Team" are actively assisting the People's Government in consolidating social security in the neighborhoods with organized actions. Nearly one million housewives are being further organized under the leadership of the Family Democratic Women's Federation to participate in various patriotic activities.

　　The religious circles of Shanghai are further actively taking action under the banner of patriotism. Patriotic elements of Christianity and Catholicism and teachers and staff of church schools in the city have held conferences against the United States rearming Japan. Christians and Catholics have signed patriotic pledges. All 666 foreign-funded and foreign-operated cultural, educational, relief agencies, and religious organizations in the city have been registered. Xuhui Middle School, McTyeire School, and St. Francis Xavier's High School have recently held school history exhibitions to expose the crimes of imperialist cultural aggression. The religious circles and teachers and staff of church schools in the city will jointly hold demonstrations against the United States rearming Japan in the coming days.
