　　Keshan Public Oil Factory's Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting Contract Inspections
　　Editor:
　　The criticism of our factory by comrades Liu Zengzhi and Wu Diankun, published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 15th, is entirely correct. In addition to sincerely accepting it, we hereby make the following self-criticism:
　　I. We were careless when signing contracts with private merchants. Only the head of the county Finance and Grain Bureau and the manager of the county Enterprise Company were present during the signing, and we did not register with the county Industry and Commerce Section, violating the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Public-Private Processing and Ordering of Goods in the Northeast Region." Accepting this lesson, we will definitely abide by government laws and regulations in the future.
　　II. Although the contract stipulated that "the processing figures must be reported to Party A (the public oil factory) daily from December 1st, and Party B (the private oil workshop) must guarantee the accuracy of the figures. When Party A takes the bean cake according to the figures at any time, Party B must guarantee the quantity and complete the task on schedule before December 31st." However, we only grasped the output quantity of the private oil workshops on a daily basis, and failed to conduct timely inspections. Due to ideological paralysis and lax work, private oil workshops such as Tongxingyuan and Tonghexing took advantage of loopholes to speculate and resell 110,000 jin of bean cake. In addition to requesting our superiors to give us the punishment we deserve, we will resolutely prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.
　　III. When grasping the quantity of bean cake processed, we did not send dedicated personnel to inspect each site. It was not until January 20th, when I was on my way to Keshan Distillery on business, that I saw a large number of horse-drawn carts pulling bean cake in the courtyard of Tongxingyuan Oil Workshop, that I discovered this problem. On the 21st, we reported to the county Finance and Grain Bureau and hurriedly contacted the railway station, tax bureau, and county Industry and Commerce Section, and only then did we stop the processed bean cake that Tongxingyuan Oil Workshop intended to privately transport and sell, at the railway station. This simplistic task-oriented viewpoint of ours, and the lack of vigilance against illegal private merchants, is a serious mistake. In the future, we must make thorough arrangements and strengthen management in our work.
　　IV. We recognize that this kind of superficial work style is not in line with the requirements of the new situation, and it also shows that we are not responsible enough for the wealth of the country and the people.

### 克山公营制油厂对忽视检查合同的检讨

　　克山公营制油厂对忽视检查合同的检讨           
    编辑同志：
    二月十五日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊载刘增智、吴殿坤二同志对我厂的批评，是完全正确的。我们除诚恳接受外，特作检讨如下：
    一、我们与私商订合同时马虎从事，签订时仅有县财粮科科长及县企业公司经理在场，未到县工商科登记，违犯了“东北区公私间加工订货管理暂行办法”的规定。接受这一教训，我们今后一定遵照政府法令办事。
    二、合同上虽规定“加工须于十二月一日起逐日报告甲方（公营制油厂）数字，乙方（私人油房）须保证正确数目。甲方随时按照数目取饼时，乙方须保证数量，并于十二月三十一日以前按期完成任务”。但是我们只逐日掌握了私人油房的出品数量，而未能按期检查。思想麻痹，工作松懈，以致被私营油房同兴源、同和兴钻了空子，投机捣卖豆饼十一万斤。我们除请求上级给我们应得的处分外，今后坚决防止再有类似的事情发生。
    三、在掌握豆饼加工数量时，我们没有派专人到各现场检查。一直到一月二十日本人赴克山制酒厂办事途中，见同兴源油房院内有大量马车在拉饼，才发现这一问题。二十一日我们才报告县财粮科急忙与车站、税务局、县工商科联系，才把同兴源油房拟私运出卖的加工豆饼从车站留下来。我们这种单纯的任务观点，对不法私商疏于防范，是严重的错误。今后我们工作中一定要周密布置，加强管理。
    四、我们认识到这种不深入的工作作风，是不合于新形势的要求的，同时也说明我们对国家人民财富的负责精神不够。
                                 克山县公营制油厂经理  李福
