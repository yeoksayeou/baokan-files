　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Barcelona dispatch: Disregarding the Franco gang's brutal and bloody suppression, the Spanish workers' strike, which began on the 12th, is still continuing. As of the 15th, several tens of thousands of workers in Barcelona and its surrounding industrial cities are still on strike. In Mataró, 10,000 textile workers are continuing their strike, and the situation is equally serious in Badalona, New Pablo, and Sabadell. In all these places, clashes between Franco's military police and striking workers are constantly occurring. Large-scale arrests are being carried out in the worker districts of Barcelona.
　　The Spanish people's fierce resistance to Franco's rule has greatly shocked American imperialism, which is desperately trying to pull Franco into the so-called Mediterranean group. On the 14th, the American air force in the Mediterranean region, using the pretext of an American plane disappearing over the Mediterranean Sea on the 9th, actually sent a large number of military aircraft to the Barcelona civilian airport, vainly attempting to intimidate the heroic Spanish people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Rome dispatch: The Italian people are enthusiastically supporting the Spanish people's general strike against Franco's rule.
　　The Italian General Confederation of Labor, representing five million Italian workers, issued a statement paying tribute to the heroic workers of Barcelona. The statement said: The Barcelona workers "expressed their firm will to obtain justice, freedom, and peace through a general strike. The Barcelona general strike shows that the long rule and brutal suppression of the Falangist regime have not crushed the Spanish people. The Spanish people are resisting suffering and preparing for a policy of war."
　　After learning of the Barcelona strike on the 13th, workers in factories throughout northern Italy immediately held brief solidarity strikes. Countless factories in Turin, Florence, and Milan passed resolutions expressing their firm support for the Spanish people's heroic struggle against fascist dictatorship. Workers at the important Pirelli factory in Milan sent a special telegram to the Barcelona workers to pay tribute to them; at the same time, they signed a petition demanding that the Italian government immediately withdraw the Italian ambassador to Madrid. Dockworkers at the port of Civitavecchia, disregarding police obstruction, held a demonstration in the city center after stopping work, cheering for the Spanish people's struggle against Franco. The mood was particularly enthusiastic among the workers at the Sabin factory in Bologna, where the Italian hero Nenni Tai, who bravely sacrificed himself in the struggle for Spanish freedom, once worked. They organized an anti-Franco committee. Workers at the Galileo machine factory in Florence raised a large flag on the tower, with the words "Long Live the Spanish People!" written on it.
　　The Italian Communist Youth League, representing 500,000 members, paid tribute to the courageous Spanish youth and their leaders—the Unified Socialist Youth League of Spain—and expressed warm support. Youth and students of various parties in Rome held a meeting at the University of Rome on the 13th, calling on professors and students to unanimously support the struggle of the Barcelona workers.

　　西班牙大罢工仍坚持中
    意大利工人学生纷纷集会示威热烈声援 
   大批美机竟飞抵巴塞罗那妄图恫吓人民
    【新华社十六日讯】巴塞罗那消息：不顾佛朗哥匪帮凶残的血腥镇压，西班牙工人从十二日开始的罢工迄今仍在坚持中。截至十五日止，在巴塞罗那及其周围各工业城市中，仍有好多万工人在罢工。在马太罗，有一万纺织工人在继续罢工，在巴达隆那、新巴布罗与萨巴德尔，局势也同样严重。在所有这些地方，佛朗哥军警与罢工工人间的冲突不断在发生。在巴塞罗那各工人区内，大规模的逮捕正在进行中。
    西班牙人民对佛朗哥统治的猛烈反抗，已使正在竭力设法把佛朗哥拉入所谓地中海集团的美国帝国主义极度震惊。十四日，美国在地中海地区的空军，竟以有一架美国飞机于九日在地中海上空失踪为借口，把大批军用飞机开到了巴塞罗那民用机场，妄图以此恫吓英勇的西班牙人民。
    【新华社十五日讯】罗马消息：意大利人民热烈声援西班牙人民反对佛朗哥统治的大罢工。
    代表五百万意大利工人的意大利总工会发表声明，向英勇的巴塞罗那工人们致敬。这个声明说：巴塞罗那工人“以总罢工表示了他们要获得正义、自由与和平的坚定意志。巴塞罗那总罢工显示，长枪党政权的长期统治和残酷镇压并没有压碎西班牙人民。西班牙人民正在反抗苦难和准备战争的政策”。
    意大利北部各工厂工人在十三日知道了巴塞罗那罢工的消息以后，马上就纷纷举行了短时间的声援罢工。都灵、佛罗伦萨和米兰的无数工厂通过决议，表示坚决支援西班牙人民反对法西斯独裁的英勇斗争。米兰重要工厂皮列利工厂工人特致电巴塞罗那工人致敬；同时签名要求意大利政府立即撤回意大利驻马德里的大使。奇维塔未克基亚港的码头工人，不顾警察的阻挠，于停工后在市中心举行示威，为西班牙人民反对佛朗哥的斗争欢呼。在参加西班牙争取自由的斗争而英勇牺牲的意大利英雄南尼泰曾经工作过的波伦亚萨宾工厂中，工人的情绪特别热烈。他们组织了反佛朗哥委员会。佛罗伦萨伽利略机器厂的工人们在高塔上升起一面大旗，上面写着：“西班牙人民万岁！”
    意大利共产主义青年团代表五十万团员向勇敢的西班牙青年及其领导者——西班牙统一社会主义青年联盟致敬，并表示热烈声援。属于各个党派的罗马青年学生十三日在罗马大学举行集会，号召教授和学生们一致支持巴塞罗那工人们的斗争。
