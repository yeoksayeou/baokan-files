Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Representatives from fifty-three units in the capital held an emergency symposium on the 9th. Participants expressed extreme indignation at the crimes of the Guangzhou Holy Infant Baby Home and the Nanjing Loving Mother and Baby Home in harming Chinese children. They unanimously supported the government in severely punishing the culprits and preventing imperialist elements from using the guise of "charity" and "relief" to slaughter Chinese children again.

The symposium was presided over by Li Dequan, Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, President of the Chinese Red Cross, and Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. She pointed out that the facts of the "Holy Infant Baby Home" run by Canadian nuns in Guangzhou slaughtering more than two thousand Chinese children, and the foreign Catholic nuns of the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home" and "Loving Mother and Baby Home" harming children, are similar to the German fascists' killing factories in Poland during the Soviet-German War and the Anglo-American imperialists harming Soviet children in West Germany. She pointed out that these facts once again exposed the evils of imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries colluding with each other and acting in collusion to harm the Chinese people. Chen Qiyuan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, pointed out that this once again proves that imperialists have consistently used methods such as charity and relief work to oppress and numb the Chinese people. Lei Jieqiong, professor of the Department of Sociology of Yenching University and member of the Standing Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, pointed out: These two incidents should make childcare workers more vigilant and recognize the true face of imperialist "charity" in China. She pointed out that such things not only happened in Nanjing and Guangzhou, but also similar incidents occurred in other places. We childcare workers and mothers who are nurturing the second generation of the nation must recognize the essence of imperialist "charity" and carry out propaganda and education among the women masses. Chen Lian of the Children's Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League said: "This shocking incident aroused our unparalleled anger. We support the government in severely punishing the criminals according to law and preventing imperialism from continuing to harm our younger brothers and sisters in China!" Li Lilian, Deputy Minister of the Children's Welfare Department of the All-China Women's Federation, who recently returned from attending the International Democratic Women's Federation Council, exposed the crimes of imperialism imprisoning and slaughtering children not only in China, but also in Greece, Spain, and West Germany, and pointed out that the cause of protecting children is inseparable from the movement to defend world peace.

Finally, Chairman Li Dequan summarized everyone's opinions: (1) Unanimously support the government's handling and judgment of the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home" incident, and are willing to assist the government in investigating in detail the Nanjing "Loving Mother and Baby Home" and Guangzhou "Holy Infant Baby Home" incidents, and severely punish the culprits according to law. Request the government to strictly inspect and supervise children's relief agencies in various places, lead them to do their work well, protect the survival and health of children, and enable children to receive normal education. (2) Call on the people of the whole country to attach importance to protecting children's rights to survival, health, and education, and actively report criminals who, in the name of charity, are mixed into the ranks of childcare workers and endanger children. (3) Call on children's welfare workers across the country to be more vigilant, strengthen their business and political studies, actively participate in the patriotic movement to resist the United States and aid Korea and defend the country, encourage each other, supervise each other, and work together to do a good job in children's work and assume the mission of nurturing the second generation of the new China.

The units participating in the symposium on the 9th included the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the China People's Relief General Association, the Chinese Red Cross, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, Beijing Normal University, Yenching University, and public and private nurseries, kindergartens, infant halls, and orphanages in Beijing.

　　抗议帝国主义分子摧残我国儿童
    首都五十三个单位代表紧急集会
    一致拥护政府严惩凶手，制止屠杀我国儿童罪行
    【新华社十日讯】首都五十三个单位的九十二位代表，九日举行紧急座谈会。与会者对广州圣婴婴儿院及南京慈爱育婴院等残害中国儿童的罪行表示极端愤慨，一致拥护政府严惩凶手，制止帝国主义分子假借“慈善”“救济”的美名，屠杀中国儿童的罪行再次发生。
    座谈会由中央人民政府卫生部长、中国红十字会会长、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全主持。她指出广州市加拿大修女主办的“圣婴婴儿院”屠杀二千多个中国儿童和南京“圣心儿童院”“慈爱育婴院”外籍天主教修女残害儿童的事实，是与苏德战争时期德国法西斯蒂在波兰的杀人工厂及英美帝国主义者在西德残害苏联儿童的事实相类似的。她指出这些事实再一次暴露了帝国主义者与国民党反动派相互勾结，狼狈为奸，损害中国人民的罪恶。中央人民政府内务部副部长陈其瑗指出，这是再次证明了帝国主义者一贯地利用慈善和救济事业等手段来压迫和麻痹中国人民。燕京大学社会系教授、全国妇联常委雷洁琼指出：这两件事应使儿童保育工作者提高警惕，认识帝国主义在中国办“慈善事业”的真面目。她指出：这种事不仅发生在南京、广州，而且在其他各地也都发生过类似的事件。我们抚育民族第二代的保育工作者和母亲们，必须认清帝国主义“慈善事业”的本质，在妇女群众中进行宣传教育。青年团中央少年儿童部陈琏说：“这件骇人听闻的事，激起我们无比的愤怒。我们拥护政府依法严惩罪犯，制止帝国主义在中国继续残害我们的弟妹！”最近出席国际民主妇联理事会返国的全国妇联儿童福利部副部长李丽莲的发言，揭露了帝国主义不仅在我们中国，而且在希腊、西班牙以及西德监禁屠杀儿童的罪行，指出保卫儿童的事业是与保卫世界和平的运动不可分离的。
    最后，李德全主席总结大家的意见：（一）一致拥护政府对南京“圣心儿童院”事件的处理和判决，并愿意协助政府详细调查南京“慈爱育婴院”及广州“圣婴婴儿院”事件，依法严惩凶手。请求政府严格检查和督促各地儿童救济机关，领导他们做好工作，保卫儿童的生存、健康，使儿童得到正常的教养。（二）号召全国人民重视保卫儿童的生存、健康和教育的权利，积极检举以慈善为名，混在保育工作者队伍中危害儿童的罪犯。（三）号召全国儿童福利工作者提高警惕，加强学习业务和政治，积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动，彼此勉励，互相监督，共同做好儿童工作，负起保育新中国第二代的使命。
    参加九日座谈会的单位有中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会、中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中央人民政府卫生部、教育部、内务部及北京市民主妇女联合会、北京师范大学、燕京大学、北京市各公私立托儿所、保育院、育婴堂、孤儿院。
