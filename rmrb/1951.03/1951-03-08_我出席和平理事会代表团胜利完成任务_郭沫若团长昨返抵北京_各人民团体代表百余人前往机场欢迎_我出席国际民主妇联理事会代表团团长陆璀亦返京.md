Xinhua News Agency, March 7th – Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council, and Lu Cui, head of the Chinese delegation to the Council Meeting of the International Democratic Women’s Federation held in Berlin, returned to Beijing at 3:00 PM on the 7th. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Chen Shutong, Li Lisan, Li Siguang, Xing Xiping, Shao Lizi, Ma Xulun, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Liang Xi, Yu Xinqing, Wu Maosun, Zhang Youyu, Xu Zhizhen, Yang Hansheng, Xie Bangding, and representatives from various people's organizations, totaling about one hundred people.

Chen Shutong delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the China Peace Committee, saying: "The head of our delegation to the World Peace Council, Guo Moruo, has returned victoriously after completing a great mission. The First Session of the World Peace Council adopted a declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers and nine important resolutions, representing the will of peace-loving people around the world and pointing out the direction and goals of the current struggle for world peace advocates. The Chinese people resolutely support these declarations and resolutions. The Chinese people are vigorously carrying out a widespread and deep-going movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. The Chinese and Korean People's forces are fighting heroically with the enemy in Korea, constantly defeating them. The Chinese people stand at the forefront of defending world peace, filled with the confidence of victory, and will certainly work with all peace-loving and just people in the world to realize the resolutions of the World Peace Council and strive for lasting world peace!"

Guo Moruo gave a reply, saying: "The Chinese delegation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the support of the people of the whole country, participated in the World Peace Council meeting and has now returned after completing its mission. The First Session of the World Peace Council was a meeting that achieved great success. It expanded the foundation of the world peace movement. Many representatives who did not participate in the Second World Peace Congress participated in this session. The original 222 council members have now been increased by 38, which is clear proof of the expansion of the foundation of the world peace movement. The Peace Council meeting adopted ten resolutions, further specifying the resolutions of the Warsaw Congress. This proves that the peace movement has made great progress. The Chinese delegation has conveyed the will of the Chinese people to defend peace at the meeting. The five suggestions put forward by the delegation have all been adopted by the meeting." Guo Moruo concluded: "In the future, we must strengthen unity, intensify the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and strive to realize the resolutions of the World Peace Council. The people of the world and the Chinese people firmly believe that peace will surely triumph over war!"

　　我出席和平理事会代表团胜利完成任务
    郭沫若团长昨返抵北京
    各人民团体代表百余人前往机场欢迎
    我出席国际民主妇联理事会代表团团长陆璀亦返京
    【新华社七日讯】我国出席世界和平理事会代表团团长郭沫若及我国出席在柏林举行的国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议代表团团长陆璀，已于七日下午三时返抵北京。前往机场欢迎者有陈叔通、李立三、李四光、邢西萍、邵力子、马叙伦、张奚若、许德珩、梁希、余心清、吴茂荪、张友渔、许之桢、阳翰笙、谢邦定以及各人民团体代表等约一百人。
    陈叔通代表中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会致欢迎词称：我国出席世界和平理事会的代表团郭沫若团长在完成了伟大的任务之后胜利回国了。世界和平理事会第一届会议通过了关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言和九项重要决议，代表了全世界爱好和平人民的意志，给世界和平拥护者指出了当前奋斗的方向和目标。中国人民坚决拥护这些宣言和决议。中国人民正轰轰烈烈地进行着普遍而深入的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，中朝人民部队正在朝鲜和敌人进行英勇无比的战斗，不断地打败敌人。中国人民站在保卫世界和平的最前线，充满了胜利的信心，一定要和全世界爱好和平正义的人类，共同为实现世界和平理事会的决议，为争取世界持久和平而奋斗到底！
    郭沫若致答词称：中国代表团在毛主席的领导和全国人民的支持下，参加了世界和平理事会会议，现在已完成任务归来。世界和平理事会第一届会议是获得了伟大成就的会议。它把世界保卫和平运动的基础扩大了。许多没有参加第二届世界和平大会的代表都参加了本届会议。理事会理事原为二百二十二人，现在又增加了三十八人，这就是世界保卫和平运动的基础扩大的明证。和平理事会会议通过了十项决议，将华沙大会的决议进一步具体化了。这证明了保卫和平运动已有了极大的发展。中国代表团已在会议上传达了中国人民保卫和平的意志。代表团提出的五项建议已全被会议采纳。郭沫若最后称：我们今后要加强团结，加紧进行抗美援朝运动，努力实现世界和平理事会的决议。世界人民和中国人民坚信着：和平一定战胜战争！
