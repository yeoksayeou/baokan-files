Shanxi Province Universally Establishes New Commercial Network
Reasonable Price Adjustments Open Up Sales Channels for Local Products

After the new commercial network in Shanxi Province took initial shape, local products sold well, and urban-rural trade became active. From 1950 to the present, the provincial state-owned trading company has helped farmers sell more than 6.7 million tons of grain, cotton, and other local products; cooperative societies in various parts of the province have sold local products worth over 53.2 billion yuan for their members. Among them, the volume of grain sold exceeded that of 1949 by 50 percent, cotton by two times, local products by three times, and oil crops by 25 times. Except for cotton and oil crops, about 50 percent of the local products were handled by private merchants.

At the same time, according to statistics from the provincial state-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth company and the department store company, more than 155,000 bolts of cloth and goods worth more than 52.1 billion yuan were sold to rural areas last year.

Such large-scale exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and between regions is the result of the state-owned trading companies, cooperative societies, and private merchants in the province cooperating and actively establishing a new commercial network. At the beginning of 1950, the state-owned trading company had only 30 branches, sub-branches, and purchasing groups in the province. By winter, with the active urban-rural trade, the organizations of grain, local products, general merchandise, cotton yarn and cloth, oil, salt, petroleum, and fur units had grown three and a half times, accounting for 50 percent of the total market turnover, and played a leading role in the market. In addition to the 101 provincial, prefectural, and county-level leading organizations of cooperative societies, there are already 2,987 village cooperatives, an increase of 10 percent compared to 1949. In areas where village cooperatives are scattered, the cooperatives have also established a mobile supply and marketing network in the form of cooperative peddlers. Private commerce, which had long suffered from the devastation of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gangs, has also rapidly recovered and developed. According to statistics from 58 counties in the six prefectures of Changzhi, Linfen, Yuci, Fenyang, Xingxian, and Xinxian, and Taiyuan City: private commercial households have increased by 5,727 in the past year. In the three towns of Yincheng in Jincheng and Changzhi counties, and Baodian in Changzi County, there are now 1,685 commercial households, an increase of 60 percent compared to the 1,026 households in 1936.

The new commercial network in Shanxi Province, with state-owned trading companies as its core, broadly undertakes the task of organized and planned exchange of urban and rural commodities through the contract system. According to incomplete statistics, last year, cooperative societies throughout the province signed 4,878 exchange contracts with state-owned trading companies, with a total exchange value accounting for one-third of the annual turnover of the cooperative societies.

Reasonable price adjustments are an important experience for Shanxi Province in opening up sales channels for unsalable local products. Farmers in counties such as Lanxian, Linxian, Kelan, Wuzhai, and Quwo in the province appropriately lowered the prices of local products last winter, taking care of the interests of transporters and sellers, which enabled many local products to find sales channels. For example, the tobacco produced in Quwo County was once unsalable due to purchases by merchants from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which caused prices to double. After the local people's government persuaded the farmers with the principle of "taking care of the interests of producers, transporters, and sellers is to protect the interests of farmers," the farmers restored the normal price ratio between tobacco and grain and signed contracts with merchants from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, by the end of last December, 796,000 catties of tobacco had been sold, accounting for 58 percent of the county's total tobacco production.

However, some cadres in various parts of the province still do not understand the importance of promoting local products, and unilaterally believe that raising the price of local products is to protect the interests of farmers, resulting in unsalable local products and losses for farmers. For example, jute skin is 3,000 yuan per catty in Tianjin and 4,000 yuan in Shanghai, but the price in Changzhi County, the place of origin, is the same as in Tianjin, and the price of jute in Xinxian is 1,000 yuan higher than in Shanghai. Similarly, the price of red dates in Tianjin is 900 yuan per catty, but in general, it is 1,000 yuan per catty in various parts of Shanxi. Therefore, farmers throughout the province still have 5 million catties of jute skin and 4.74 million catties of red dates that have not been sold recently. Some other local products are even flowing backward due to excessive prices. For example, a large amount of peanuts and hawthorns produced in Shanxi cannot be sold, but Taiyuan merchants buy back 15 tons of peanut kernels and a large number of hawthorns from Hebei and Jinan.

The price of unsalable local products is often not unable to be lowered because of high costs. The Dongshe and Sulongkou areas of Guoxian County produce more than 100,000 catties of jute skin annually, which has always been welcomed by the Shanghai and Tianjin markets, but all of them were unsalable last year, the reason being the excessive price. The general yield of jute skin in the area is 50 catties per mu. Selling it at a high price of 5,000 yuan per catty yields 250,000 yuan per mu, which is 124,000 yuan more than growing corn. If the price is lowered to 3,500 yuan per catty, it can still be sold, which is still 50,000 yuan more than growing corn. For example, sowing peanuts in sandy land in Hongdong County is far more profitable than wheat; however, 1 million catties of peanuts in the county cannot be sold due to excessive prices. If the original price of 1,200 yuan per catty of peanuts is lowered to 800 yuan and sold, it can still earn 50 percent more per mu compared to growing wheat. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　山西省普遍建立新商业网
    合理调整价格打开了土产销路
    山西省在新商业网粗具规模后，土产畅销，城乡贸易活跃。一九五○年起至现在止，省国营贸易公司已为农民推销粮食、棉花及其他土产达六百七十多万吨；省内各地合作社推销社员土产的总值达五百三十二亿余元。其中粮食推销数较一九四九年超过百分之五十，棉花超过二倍，土产超过三倍，油料超过二十五倍。除棉花、油料外，土产品由私商经营的约占百分之五十。
    同时，据该省国营花纱布公司和百货公司的统计，去年有十五万五千多匹布和价值五百二十一亿多元的百货销售到农村。
    城乡之间、地区之间能有这样大规模的物资交流，是全省国营贸易公司、合作社和私商分工合作，积极建立新商业网的结果。一九五○年初，国营贸易公司在全省仅有分、支公司及收购小组三十个，到冬季，随着城乡贸易的活跃，粮食、土产、百货、花纱布、油脂、盐业、石油、皮毛八个单位的组织即发展三倍半，经营额占全市场成交总额的百分之五十，在市场上发挥了国营经济的领导作用。合作社除省、专区、县三级领导机构一百零一个以外，村社已有二千九百八十七个，较一九四九年增加了百分之十。在村社分散的地区，合作社并建立了一种合作货郎制的流动供销网。曾长期遭受日寇与蒋阎匪帮摧残的私人商业，也迅速地恢复和发展起来。据长治、临汾、榆次、汾阳、兴县、忻县六个专区五十八县及太原市的统计：私人商业一年来增加五千七百二十七户。晋城、长治县的荫城、长子县的鲍店三个城镇，现在有商业一千六百八十五户，较一九三六年的一千零二十六户增加了百分之六十。
    山西省的新商业网以国营贸易公司为核心，广泛通过合同制，担负着比较有组织、有计划的城乡商品的交流任务。据不完全统计：去年全省合作社与国营贸易公司签订交换合同四千八百七十八件，交换总值达全年合作社经营额的三分之一。                （新）
    合理调整价格是山西省为滞销的土产品打开销路的一条重要经验。该省岚县、临县、岢岚、五寨、曲沃等县农民在去年冬季适当降低了土产价格，照顾了运销者的利益，使得许多土产有了销路。如曲沃县所产烟叶，曾因内蒙古自治区客商收购致价格上涨一倍而销不出去。当地人民政府以“照顾产、运、销三方利益，就是保障农民利益”的道理说服农民后，农民恢复了烟、粮的正常比价，便和内蒙古自治区商人签订合同。因此到去年十二月底，已经脱售的烟叶即达七十九万六千斤，占该县烟叶总产量的百分之五十八。
    但是，省内各地有些干部至今还不了解推销土产的重要，片面地以为抬高土产价格是为着保护农民利益，结果土产滞销，农民吃亏。例如麻皮，在天津是三千元一斤，上海四千元，而产地长治县价格竟和天津相同，忻县麻价更比上海高一千元。又如天津红枣价格每斤九百元，山西各地一般却须一千元一斤。因此，全省农民最近还存有五百万斤麻皮和四百七十四万斤红枣没有销出。另一些土产甚至由于价格过高，形成倒流。如山西所产大量花生和红果无法出售，太原商人却从河北、济南买回十五吨花生仁和大量山楂。
    滞销土产的价格往往不是因为成本高而无法调低。崞县属东社和苏龙口一带年产麻皮十多万斤，向来为上海和天津市场所欢迎，去年却全部滞销，原因就是价格过高。该地麻皮的一般产量是每亩五十斤，按每斤五千元高价出售，每亩收益二十五万元，比种玉米可多收入十二万四千元；如果调低到每斤三千五百元即可售出，仍比种玉米多收入五万元。又如洪洞县砂地播种花生远比小麦有利；但是该县一百万斤花生果却因价格过高而卖不出去。假使将原先一千二百元一斤的花生果价格调低到八百元售出，与种麦相比每亩仍可多收入百分之五十。        （新华社）
