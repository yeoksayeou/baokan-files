　　Infiltrating Democratic Parties to Carry Out Sabotage
    Special Agent Li Junying Sentenced to Death

    [This Newspaper Despatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Chongqing People's Court organized a People's Tribunal to publicly try the Kuomintang bandit special agent Li Junying, who infiltrated democratic parties to carry out sabotage activities, sentenced him to death, and executed him by shooting.

    The bandit Li Junying established contact with the Kuomintang military intelligence service as early as 1941. In 1946, when Li bandit was working at Chongqing University, he re-established contact with Xu bandit Zheng, the head of the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau's Southwest District. Xu bandit ordered him to infiltrate democratic parties as an inside agent. Li bandit then used the alias Li Qin, code-named 31, and feigned progressiveness to carry out activities. In 1947, Li bandit personally drafted a plan and conspired with Xu bandit to sabotage the work of democratic parties in the Southwest region. In 1948, Li bandit was again ordered by Xu bandit to go to Hong Kong to spy on the organizational situation of the new Political Consultative Conference, and took a detour to Nanjing to meet with Central Statistics Bureau chief Ye bandit Xiufeng. After Li bandit went to Hong Kong, he disguised himself as a democrat to carry out activities, and contacted Ye bandit through the Guangzhou Central Statistics Bureau radio station, reporting the internal situation of the various democratic parties and organizations participating in the new CPPCC. At the same time, Li bandit gained the trust of Lu Fangzi of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Hong Kong, and returned to Chongqing to prepare for the establishment of the Chongqing Municipal Branch of the RCCK. After Li bandit returned to Chongqing, he reported the organization situation and internal personnel activities of the RCCK to Xu bandit on time. In August 1949, due to Li bandit's betrayal, more than ten members of the RCCK Chongqing organization, including Li Youlin, were arrested by the Kuomintang military intelligence service, and four of them died in the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" in Ciqikou; Zhou Shaoxuan, Yin Ziqin and others were imprisoned or wanted by Kuomintang special agents because of Li bandit's framing. On the eve of the liberation of Chongqing, Li bandit fled to Chengdu with Xu bandit. When Xu bandit left Chengdu to fly to Taiwan, he ordered Li bandit to return to Chongqing to lie dormant. After the liberation of Chongqing, Li bandit sneaked back to Chongqing and continued to carry out activities at Chongqing University while pretending to be progressive.

    Li bandit Junying's above-mentioned counter-revolutionary facts were reported by members of the RCCK Chongqing organization, victims Zhou Shaoxuan, Yin Ziqin, etc., and confirmed by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's investigation. The bandit was arrested last October. On January 9 this year, the Municipal People's Court specially organized a People's Tribunal to hold a public trial. More than a thousand people, including representatives of local organizations of democratic parties in Chongqing and representatives of various people's organizations, attended the public trial. At the meeting, Li Zixiang of the Chongqing Municipal Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, on behalf of the party, accused Li of his shameless crimes before the People's Court. In his accusation, Li Zixiang called on RCCK members and various democratic parties to learn from Li's traitorous activities, seriously rectify their organizations, eliminate special agent elements who had infiltrated democratic parties, and consolidate the people's democratic united front. Tian Yiping of the Chongqing Branch Provisional Working Committee of the China Democratic League, Xu Chonglin of the Chongqing Provisional Working Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and Ouyang Ping of the Chongqing Provisional Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously stated that they would be more vigilant to prevent Chiang bandit special agents from infiltrating democratic parties to carry out sabotage activities.

    The People's Tribunal accepted the demands of various democratic parties and representatives of people from all walks of life, and, in accordance with Article 2 of the instructions on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries issued by the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council and the Supreme People's Court, sentenced Li bandit Junying to death and executed him by shooting on the same day.

　　混入民主党派进行破坏
    特务李君英处死刑
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：重庆市人民法院组织人民法庭，公审混入民主党派内进行破坏活动的蒋匪特务分子李君英，并判处死刑，执行枪决。
    李匪君英，早于一九四一年即与国民党军统特务机关发生关系。一九四六年，李匪在重庆大学任职时，复与国民党中统特务机关西南区负责人徐匪政联系。徐匪命其潜入民主党派作内线工作。李匪遂化名李溱，代号三十一号，伪装进步，进行活动。一九四七年，李匪曾亲拟计划，与徐匪合谋破坏民主党派在西南地区的工作。一九四八年，李匪复奉徐匪之命赴香港窥探新政治协商会议组织情况，并取道南京与中统特务头子叶匪秀峰相会。李匪赴香港后，伪装民主人士，进行活动，并通过广州中统电台与叶匪联络，报告参加新政协的各民主党派与团体的内部情形。同时，李匪在港骗取中国国民党革命委员会吕芳子的信任，回重庆筹组民革重庆市分会。李匪回重庆后，即按时将民革组织情况和内部人事活动向徐匪汇报。一九四九年八月，由于李匪的出卖，重庆市民革组织成员黎又霖等十余人被国民党军统特务机关逮捕，内有四人死于磁器口“中美合作所”内；周绍轩、尹子勤等因李匪陷害，遭国民党特务监禁或通缉。重庆解放前夕，李匪随徐匪逃往成都。徐匪于离成都飞台时，曾令李匪返重庆潜伏活动。重庆市解放后，李匪即潜回重庆，并伪装进步，在重庆大学继续进行活动。
    李匪君英的以上反革命事实，经民革重庆市组织成员、被害人周绍轩、尹子勤等检举，复经市公安局调查属实后，于去年十月将该匪逮捕。今年一月九日，市人民法院特组织人民法庭，举行公审。参加公审大会的包括各民主党派重庆市地方组织及各人民团体代表等千余人。会上，中国国民党革命委员会重庆市临时工作委员会李紫翔，代表该党向人民法庭控诉了李犯的无耻罪行。李紫翔在控诉中号召民革党员及各民主党派应以李犯的内奸活动为教训，严肃整顿组织，清除混入民主党派内的特务分子，巩固人民民主统一战线。民主同盟重庆支部临时工作委员会田一平、民主建国会重庆临时工作委员会徐崇林、农工民主党重庆临时工作委员会欧阳平等也都在会上发言，他们一致表示：要加倍提高警惕，防止蒋匪特务混入民主党派内进行破坏活动。
    人民法庭接受各民主党派及各界人民代表的要求，依据中央人民政府政务院、最高人民法院关于镇压反革命指示第二条，判处李犯君英死刑，并于同日执行枪决。
