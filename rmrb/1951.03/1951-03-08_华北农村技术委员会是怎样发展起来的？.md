Editor's Note: Rural Technology Research Committees are organizations created by the people in old liberated areas to improve agricultural techniques. They have developed significantly in various provinces of North China, especially Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan. The North China Agricultural Technology Conference summary emphasized: "To exchange mass experiences and promote mass creativity, it is necessary to develop farmers' technical organizations, such as technology committees, technology groups, and small farms, in a planned way, and strengthen leadership and assistance to them." This article introduces the growth, development, and experiences of the North China Rural Technology Committee.

            I. Initial Development

    In 1944, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and the North China Xinhua Daily jointly compiled the "Agricultural Bimonthly" for a year. It was published every agricultural seasonal date, mainly guiding the improvement of agricultural production techniques in the Taihang area.

    Because rural elementary schools in various places often explained the newspaper to farmers, and farmers welcomed discussions on production techniques, technology committees (hereinafter referred to as Tech Committees) began to be organized in Nanliu Village in Lucheng County, Yantouling and Xiazhuang Villages in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, during the spring plowing movement that year.

    The Tech Committees were organized with labor models and village elementary school teachers as the backbone, and then absorbed some production activists and experienced old farmers. They collectively read the "Agricultural Bimonthly" in the newspaper and discussed agricultural technology issues.

    In the winter of 1944, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government held the Second Agricultural Exhibition in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, vigorously promoting the King Queen Corn. Because King Queen Corn had a high yield, farmers welcomed it, but they did not know how to grow it. At that time, the government decided to organize and lead the Tech Committees to promote King Queen Corn.

    During the spring plowing in 1945, the Tech Committees were quickly developed to more than 20 in the King Queen Corn promotion areas of Licheng and Lucheng counties. The government supplied them with seeds and guided their cultivation techniques.

    This year, the activities of the Tech Committees began to be linked to the government's agricultural promotion work. However, its activities were still limited to the cultivation labor of a few committee members themselves, and had not yet been well integrated with the broad masses.

    In the spring plowing of 1945, the Taihang area advocated planting cotton. The government focused on Lucheng County, enriching the county farm to create leadership experience in developing the Tech Committees.

    In that year, Lucheng County Farm organized more than 30 Tech Committees throughout the county, focusing on the promotion of cotton, King Queen Corn, 811 millet, and 169 wheat. It also regularly checked and guided the cultivation techniques of the Tech Committees, and helped the Tech Committees do some promotional work in the villages.

    At that time, Lucheng County did not have the habit of planting cotton, but thanks to the research and guidance of the Tech Committees, many farmers learned to grow cotton and benefited from it. Since then, the role of the Tech Committees has attracted widespread attention.

    Within this year, a total of 450 Tech Committees were organized in the five counties of Changzhi, Licheng, Lucheng, Pingshun, and Huguan in the Changzhi Special District.

    In the winter of 1946, the Taihang area held a hero meeting and an agricultural exhibition in Changzhi, Shanxi. The agricultural exhibition highlighted the promotion achievements of Lucheng County Farm and the Tech Committees, and awarded Liu Jubao of Nanliu Village Tech Committee in Lucheng County as a "seed breeding expert."

    In 1947, the Taihang area established a central Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry in the Changzhi Special District, giving the bureau the specific task of "establishing county farms, developing Tech Committees, and creating a mass agricultural extension network." In this year, county farms were established in all five counties in the special district, and more than 700 Tech Committees were developed.

    Due to the large increase in the number of Tech Committees, the county farms felt some difficulty in leading them individually. Therefore, in the second half of the year, 40 central Tech Committees were cultivated from these more than 700 Tech Committees.

    These central Tech Committees were established with the residential areas of the joint defense villages as units, and with prestigious labor models and production experts as the backbone to form a central organization. The county farm led the Tech Committees in nearby villages through this central Tech Committee.

    At this time, Lucheng was still a key county. Among its more than 100 Tech Committees, there were 22 central Tech Committees. And most of the Tech Committees had close ties with mutual aid groups. Some mutual aid groups also elected technical instructors or technical team leaders. These technical instructors or team leaders directly participated in the Tech Committees; some Tech Committees hired promoters in the mutual aid groups to make direct contact. In this way, labor mutual aid and technical improvement were combined.

    During the wheat harvest in 1947, Lucheng County Farm, through 22 central Tech Committees, led the Tech Committees and mutual aid groups in the county to select 220,000 jin of 169 wheat seeds using field seed selection methods. This was a remarkable achievement at the time!

            II. Expansion and Consolidation

    In January 1949, the North China People's Government introduced the work experience of the Taihang area Tech Committees to various provinces in North China at the North China Agriculture and Forestry Conference held in Shijiazhuang. This greatly advanced the work of the Tech Committees.

    In Hebei Province alone, 129 county farms and more than 3,000 Tech Committees were developed in 1949 and 1950. Although they were established at different times, and some did not play a major role, relying on these county farms and Tech Committees, a powerful and broad promotion network was initially formed, promoting the province's vigorous seed selection and insect removal campaigns in the past two years.

    In 1950, Hebei Province selected more than 40 million jin of improved seeds of various crops. More than 60 excellent farmer varieties were also selected. This achievement is inseparable from the Tech Committees throughout the province.

    Pingyuan Province took the Tech Committee a step further, targeting labor models and production experts, and establishing "small farms" - demonstration farmland - in their own land for cultivation comparison and cultivation demonstration. Through the demonstration of these "small farms," various improved agricultural techniques were promoted. In Anyang Special District alone, more than 3,000 "small farms" were established.

    These "small farms" not only played a demonstrative role in agricultural promotion, but also created many achievements in experimental research, providing agricultural experimental researchers with a lot of valuable material. Such as using wooden plows to drive away red spiders in wheat fields, using wooden sticks to poke pits in rapeseed fields to catch golden flower insects, and cotton close planting methods. Even using peanut rhizobium to mix seeds for planting peanuts, the results of mass experiments were better than those of the farm. Most of these were created by "small farms."

    In general, through the Tech Committees, farmers have begun to master new agricultural technologies, and have created many achievements and high-yield records in the relatively simple experimental research work of agricultural technology. For example, the Tech Committee of Gao Guandou in Shen County, Hebei Province, researched the use of customer soil and broom grass planting methods to improve 18 hectares of alkaline land for cotton planting. Liu Laohe's Tech Committee in Zhoujiazhuang, Jin County, led the masses to eliminate and treat 3,936 mu of cotton field fire spiders, and taught 800 people in the village how to prepare lime sulfur mixture. Zhang Xishun's Tech Committee in Niangniangmiao, Daming, created a record of 900 jin per mu of Huarnong No. 4 millet, etc.

            III. Experience and Lessons

    From the development of agricultural technology committees in North China, and its close relationship with agricultural production, the following experience should be accepted:

    (1) The Tech Committee should be established on the basis of mutual aid groups: Most of the farmers who have been organized have overcome difficulties such as labor and livestock, and their demands for improving technology and increasing production are very urgent. At the same time, because they are organized and led in production labor, it is easier to promote technology to them. For example, the members of the Tech Committee in Gao Guandou are all experienced old farmers in various mutual aid groups. Therefore, they can achieve the result of improving 18 hectares of alkaline land through 96 mutual aid groups, establish the prestige of the Tech Committee among the masses, and consolidate and develop the mutual aid groups.

    (2) The Tech Committee must be established through specific work: Organize the masses to study and solve specific technical problems required by the masses, and then give scientific and technological guidance and organizational leadership assistance. Only the Tech Committees established in this way have practical work content. For example, the Tech Committee in Zhoujiazhuang, Jin County, was established through the requirements of the masses to eliminate and treat cotton red spiders, and then continued to develop cotton pruning and seed selection work. The masses constantly put forward new requirements to the Tech Committee with the agricultural season, so that the Tech Committee gradually consolidated.

    (3) The Tech Committee must have regular leadership: The county farm should maintain close contact with the Tech Committee. Regularly send people to guide them in discussing technology, solving problems, and prioritizing the promotion of new pesticides, agricultural tools, and technologies to them. Expand the influence of the Tech Committee among the masses through the experimental demonstration of the Tech Committee. And we should organize Tech Committees in various villages to exchange experience and summarize achievements in a planned way. In this way, the work of the Tech Committee can be gradually improved. For example, there are more than 60 Tech Committees in Anguo County. The 42 with the most significant achievements under the key guidance of the county farm. In addition to convening seminars in seasons to exchange experience and visit each other, the county farm also conducts crop competitions and elects models in the autumn to further improve the work enthusiasm of the Tech Committee. For example, after Xu Jingfen, the director of the Da Wen Village Tech Committee last year, returned to the village after the meeting, he researched winter manure accumulation methods, leading the village's 300 households to form 76 sideline mutual aid groups such as milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning, and making tofu, and invited more than 200 nearby farmers to discuss technical improvement issues.

    In general, the Tech Committee is a mass organization that farmers urgently require to improve technology and increase production after they have land and their production enthusiasm is improved. Therefore, this work should be widely carried out in areas where "organization" is relatively well-established.

    Mutual aid groups "organize" labor, and the Tech Committee "organizes" intensive farming. Only by closely combining these two types of organizations can production efficiency be fully improved. But combination does not equal mixing. The members of the Tech Committee should basically be experienced old farmers, gathering the most experienced old farmers in the village, and often helping the village's mutual aid groups to study and solve ways to increase production. Therefore, it needs to be organized separately from the mutual aid groups.

    Because it is the farmers' own organization, the organizational form may be diverse. There is no need to force uniformity on this point. Committees or groups, regular meetings or irregular meetings are all acceptable. The scale should be from small to large, from three or four people to more than ten people. The tasks cannot be mechanically prescribed, and should be gradually developed and enriched from simple to complex. Even a single study of a technology (beekeeping or tree planting) is acceptable. We should promote and promote it, and should not restrict and restrain it.

    If the Tech Committee organization is relatively common in a certain area, in order to facilitate leadership, model individuals can be cultivated in a planned way in regular work to establish central Tech Committees, with the central Tech Committees as the focus, and lead the general through the key. However, we must pay attention to not making the central Tech Committee the superior of the general Tech Committee. As for participating in or withdrawing from the Tech Committee, and whether or not to accept improved technologies and excellent varieties, farmers must be voluntary and should not be forced in any way. Administratively, the Tech Committee should not be regarded as a level of organization, and the members of the Tech Committee should not be used as cadres.

　　华北农村技术委员会是怎样发展起来的？
    李俊
    编者按：农村技术研究委员会，是老区群众一种改良农业技术的组织。在华北各省，特别是山西、河北、平原等省，已有很大的发展。华北农业技术会议总结中，曾着重提出：“为交流群众经验，发扬群众创造，要有计划地发展农民的技术组织，如技术委员会、技术小组、小农场等，并对其加强领导与帮助。”本文是华北农村技术委员会的成长，发展及其经验的介绍。
            一、初期的发展
    一九四四年还是在抗日战争时期，晋冀鲁豫边区农林局与华北新华日报社，在报纸上合编了一年的“农事半月刊”。每逢农历节令日出版一次。指导当时，主要是太行区的农业生产技术改进。
    由于当时各地农村小学，常给农民讲报纸，农民又欢迎讨论生产技术。那年春耕运动的时候，就在山西潞城县南流村、黎城县岩头岭和下庄等村，开始组织了技术委员会（以下简称技委会）。
    技委会的组织，以劳动模范与村小学校教员为骨干，再吸收一些生产积极分子和有经验的老农。集体地阅读报纸上的“农事半月刊”，讨论农业技术问题。
    一九四四年冬季，晋冀鲁豫边区政府在山西黎城县，开第二届农业展览会，大力推广金皇后玉茭。因为金皇后玉茭产量大，农民欢迎，但是农民不会种它。当时政府就决定以技委会为推广金皇后玉茭的对象，进行组织领导。
    一九四五年春耕的时候，在黎城、潞城两个县的金皇后玉茭推广区，很快地就把技委会发展到二十多个。政府供给他们种籽，并指导他们的耕作技术。
    这年技委会的活动，开始与政府的农业推广工作发生了联系。但是它的活动，还只是局限在几个委员本身的耕作劳动上，与广大群众还没有很好地结合起来。
    一九四五年春耕的时候，太行区提倡种棉花。政府以潞城县为重点，充实县农场，创造开展技委会的领导经验。
    在那一年里，潞城县农场以推广棉花、金皇后玉茭、八一一谷、一六九小麦为主，在全县组织了三十多个技委会。并不时地检查指导技委会的耕作技术，还帮助技委会在村里作一些推广宣传工作。
    那时潞城县并没有种棉花的习惯，但是由于技委会的研究指导，不少农民都学会了种棉花，并且得到了利益。从此，技委会的作用，才引起了普遍的注意。
    这一年内，在长治专区的长治、黎城、潞城、平顺、壶关五个县里，共组织了四百五十个技委会。
    一九四六年冬季，太行区在山西长治举行了群英大会及农业展览会；在农业展览会里突出地表现了潞城县农场与技委会的推广成绩，并评奖了潞城县南流村技委会刘聚宝为“育种能手”。
    一九四七年太行区在长治专区成立了中心农林局，并给该局以“建立县农场，发展技委会，创造群众性的农业推广网”的具体任务。就在这一年，在全专区五个县里，都建立了县农场，并且发展了七百多个技委会。
    由于技委会数量的大量增加，县农场对它的个别领导，感到有些困难。因此，后半年又在这七百多个技委会里，培养了四十个中心技委会。
    这些中心技委会，是以联防村的小区为单位，以有声望的劳动模范、生产能手为骨干，成立中心组织。县农场通过这个中心技委会，领导附近村的技委会。
    这时候，潞城还是重点县，它的一百多个技委会中，有二十二个中心技委会。并且大部分的技委会都和互助组有着密切的联系。有的互助组还推选了技术指导员或技术组长。这些技术指导员或组长，都直接参加技委会；也有的由技委会在互助组里聘请推广员，发生直接联系。就这样，把劳动互助与技术改进结合起来了。
    一九四七年麦收时期，潞城县农场通过二十二个中心技委会，领导全县的技委会、互助组，用田间选种的方法，采选了二十二万斤一六九小麦种籽。这在当时是个了不起的成绩！
            二、扩大与巩固
    一九四九年一月，华北人民政府在石家庄召开的华北农林会议上，向华北各省介绍了太行区技委会的工作经验。这样，把技委会的工作大大地向前推进了一步。
    仅河北省在一九四九、一九五○两年内，就发展了一百二十九个县农场，三千多个技委会。虽然建立有早有晚，也有的不大起作用，但是依靠了这些县农场与技委会，初步地组成了有力的广泛的推广网，推动了全省两年来轰轰烈烈的选种与除虫等运动。
    河北省在一九五○年内，各种作物的优良种籽，共选了四千多万斤。还选出了六十多个农家优良品种。这个成绩是与全省的技委会分不开的。
    平原省把技委会更提高了一步，以劳动模范、生产能手为主要对象，在他们自己的地里，建立作栽培比较和耕作示范的“小农场”——示范农田。经过这些“小农场”的示范，推广各种改良农业技术。仅在安阳一个专区，就建立了三千多个“小农场”。
    这些“小农场”不但在农业推广上起了示范作用，并且在试验研究上，创造了不少的成绩，给农业试验研究工作者提供了很多宝贵的材料。如用木?绑簸箕推麦田的红蜘蛛，用木棍在油菜地里捣坑捉金花虫，以及棉花密植法等。甚至用花生根瘤菌拌种种花生，群众试验的结果，比农场的成绩还好。这些大部分都是“小农场”所创造的。
    总起来讲，通过技委会，已经使农民开始掌握了新的农业技术，并且在比较简单的农业技术的试验研究工作上，创造了不少成绩和丰产的纪录。如河北省深县高贯斗的技委会，研究出用客土与种扫帚草的方法，改良了碱地种棉十八顷。晋县周家庄刘老合的技委会，领导群众除治棉田火蜘蛛三千九百三十六亩，教会全村八百人学会配制石灰硫磺合剂。大名娘娘庙张希顺领导的技委会，创造出华农四号谷一亩九百斤的纪录等。
            三、经验与教训
    从华北地区农业技术委员会的发展，以及它和农业生产的密切关系来看，应接受如下的经验：
    （一）技委会应建立在互助组的基础上：已经组织起来的农民，大部克服了劳动力和牲畜等困难，对于提高技术，增加生产的要求非常迫切。同时因为在生产劳动上有组织又有领导，所以对他们推广技术比较容易。如高贯斗的技委会，委员都是各互助组里有经验的老农。因此，他们能通过九十六个互助组，造成改良十八顷碱地的成绩，树立了技委会在群众中的威信，巩固与发展了互助组。
    （二）技委会要通过具体工作去建立：通过群众共同要求的具体技术问题，去组织群众自己研究解决，领导上再给以科学技术的指导，和组织领导的帮助。这样建立起来的技委会，才有实际的工作内容。如晋县周家庄技委会，是通过群众除治棉花红蜘蛛的要求建立起来的，随着又继续展开了棉花整枝与选种工作。群众随着农事季节向技委会不断提出新的要求，这样便使技委会逐步地巩固起来。
    （三）技委会要有经常的领导：县农场应该经常与技委会密切联系。时常派人指导他们讨论技术，解决问题，优先向他们推广新的农药、农具和技术。通过技委会的实验示范，扩大技委会在群众中的影响。并应有计划地组织各村技委会交流经验，总结成绩。这样，技委会的工作才能逐步提高，如安国县有六十多个技委会，经县农场重点指导的四十二个成绩都比较显著，县农场除按季节召集他们开座谈会，交流经验，互相参观外，秋季还进行比赛庄稼和选举模范，进一步提高技委会的工作情绪。如去年大文村技委会主任徐景汾，会后回村就研究出冬季积肥办法，带动全村三百户，组成磨粉、榨油、轧花、作豆腐等七十六个副业互助组，并邀集附近二百多农民，座谈改良技术的问题。
    总起来说，技委会是在农民有了土地，生产情绪提高以后，迫切要求改良技术增加生产的一种群众组织。因此，在“组织起来”比较有基础的地区，应该广泛地开展这个工作。
    互助组使劳动力“组织起来”，技委会使精耕细作“组织起来”。要把这两种组织紧密地结合起来，才能充分地提高生产效率。但是结合又不等于混合。技委会的成员，基本上应该以经验丰富的老农为主，集合全村最有经验的老农，经常帮助全村的互助组，研究与解决增产的办法。因此，它须要在互助组以外，单另组织。
    因为它是农民自己的组织，在组织形式上，可能是多种多样的。这一点不必强求一致。委员会或小组，定期会或不定期会都可以。规模要由小到大，三四个人到十多个人都行。任务也不能机械规定，应该由单纯到复杂，逐步发展充实。甚至单一的研究一种技术（养蜂或植树）也可以。我们应该提倡推动它，不应该限制拘束它。
    如果在某个地区，技委会组织的比较普遍，为了领导便利，可以在经常工作中，有计划地培养模范，建立中心技委会，以中心技委会为重点，通过重点领导一般。但是要注意不能把中心技委会弄成是一般技委会的上级。至于参加或退出技委会，以及对改良技术与优良品种的接受与否，必须农民自愿，不要加以任何勉强。行政上也不能把技委会看成一级机构，而将技委会的成员，当作干部来使用。
