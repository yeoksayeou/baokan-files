　　Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang
    Deeply Inspects Work in a Factory Workshop
    Attaching Great Importance to Experiences in Improving Workers' Lives on the Basis of Developing Production
    After convening a symposium with cadres from grassroots trade unions of a dozen or so factories on March 13 to discuss their work experiences, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally inspected the work of one of these factories on March 16. Upon arriving at the factory, Chairman Gao Gang immediately listened to reports from the factory director, deputy director, and chairman of the trade union (the Party committee secretary was away at a meeting). He then personally went to various workshops to understand the production process and examine how veteran technical workers were training new workers. When talking with veteran technical workers and technicians in the workshop, Chairman Gao Gang gave them encouragement for actively developing production and diligently training new technical workers. Chairman Gao Gang also inspected the factory's working conditions. He praised the collective welfare undertakings for workers established by the factory on the basis of developing production. He personally inspected the factory's clinic, workers' children's school, workers' night sanatorium, health cafeteria, club, library, cooperative, nursery, and medical clinic for workers' families. He also visited workers' dormitories and dining halls to inquire about their living conditions, showing great concern for their production and lives.

    Because the factory's administration, trade union, and Party committee all centered on completing the production plan, implementing unified leadership, closely cooperating, and acting in unison, the entire year's task was completed two months ahead of schedule, exceeding the original plan by 20 percent. Product quality increased from 96.09 percent to 99.905 percent. Costs decreased by an average of 37.73 percent from January of last year. Because the factory continuously improved production, it gradually improved the lives of all workers, systematically establishing the aforementioned collective welfare undertakings for workers. In the form of collective contracts, it clearly stipulated the responsibilities that both parties should fulfill in completing and exceeding production tasks and improving workers' welfare, resolutely implementing these contracts. Chairman Gao Gang attached great importance to the factory's experience of improving workers' lives as much as possible on the basis of developing production, believing that this should also be done in other factories and mines. At the same time, he encouraged all the factory's workers to consolidate and promote their existing achievements, further improve production, and pay particular attention to improving technology and product quality, gradually implementing piece-rate wages in order to further improve the factory's management.

　　东北人民政府高岗主席
    深入车间检查一个工厂工作 
    对在发展生产基础上改善职工生活的经验极为重视
    东北人民政府高岗主席于三月十三日召集了十几个工厂基层工会的干部座谈了基层工会的工作经验之后，随即于三月十六日亲自检查了其中的一个工厂的工作。高岗主席到达该厂后当即听取了厂长、副厂长、工会主席等同志（党委书记出外开会不在家）的汇报，然后亲自到各车间了解生产过程，并检查了老的技术工人如何培养新工人问题。高岗主席同车间老技术工人及技师谈话时，对于他们积极发展生产，努力培养新的技术工人，曾加鼓励。高岗主席同时检查了工厂的劳动条件，对于该厂在发展生产的基础上所举办的职工集体福利事业，予以赞扬，并亲自检查了该厂的医疗所，职工子弟学校，工人夜间疗养所，保健食堂，俱乐部，图书馆，合作社，托儿所及职工家属医疗所等，并分别到职工宿舍、饭堂询问职工生活情形，对于职工生产及生活状况，极为关怀。
    该厂由于行政、工会和党委均以完成生产计划为中心，实行了统一领导，紧密配合，步调一致，因之去年全年任务提前两个月完成，超过了原计划的百分之二十；产品质量由百分之九六点○九，提高到百分之九九点九○五；成本从去年一月份平均降低了百分之三七点七三。因为该厂不断地提高了生产，因而就逐步地改善了全体职工生活，有计划地给职工举办了上述各种集体福利事业，并以集体合同的形式，明确规定了在完成与超过生产任务和改善职工福利事业上双方应尽的责任，坚决贯彻执行。高岗主席对于该厂在发展生产基础上尽可能地改善职工生活的经验，极为重视，认为在其他厂矿也应该这样做。同时并勉励该厂全体职工，巩固和发扬已有的成绩，进一步搞好生产，尤应注意提高技术，提高成品质量，逐步地实行计件工资，以便更加改进工厂的经营管理工作。
