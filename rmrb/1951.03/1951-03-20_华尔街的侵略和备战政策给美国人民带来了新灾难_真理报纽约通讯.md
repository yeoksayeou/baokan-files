　　Wall Street's Aggression and War Preparation Policies Bring New Disasters to the American People
    Pravda New York Dispatch
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* published a New York dispatch by Lasardin and Filipov, entitled "The Results of Militarization of the American Economy."

    The reporters wrote: The decline in American industrial production, which began in the autumn of 1948, has been halted due to the government's allocation of billions of dollars to American monopoly capitalists to engage in an arms expansion campaign. The military adventure in Korea provided an even stronger stimulus to the expansion of military production. American industry is being mobilized for greater expansion of military production. The military adventure in Korea, and the resulting boom in military industries, is providing American monopoly capitalists with a source of unprecedented profits. One of Wall Street's tycoons, DuPont's massive chemical concern (which is receiving orders for atomic weapons of mass destruction), earned its highest profits ever last year.

    Accompanying stock speculation and arms dealers vying for lucrative contracts are increasingly blatant exploitation, fraud, bribery, and corruption. All government agencies, up to senior White House officials, are involved in these shameful dealings.

    However, the abnormal expansion of the American military-industrial sector is increasingly and more insidiously affecting peaceful consumer industries. The government is restricting the supply of steel, manganese, and rubber to civilian industries. Newspaper economic commentators and business representatives predict a sharp decline in the production of many daily necessities in mid-1951. According to government experts, the number of new homes built will decrease by 45% this year.

    America's frantic arms expansion and militarization are placing an increasingly heavy burden on the American working people. Even according to the economic experts of the reactionary American newspapers, the purchasing power of the dollar has fallen by almost two-thirds in recent years. The decline in the dollar's purchasing power has further reduced the real wages of workers. This situation has been particularly acute since the American invasion of Korea. Nearly 20 million American families are living in misery, without even the minimum cost of living. To compensate for the huge appropriations for arms expansion and related military spending, the Truman administration has repeatedly increased new taxes, the main burden of which falls on the workers. The American ruling clique's adventure in Korea and America's intensified militarization have triggered a new sharp rise in prices. According to American newspapers, wholesale prices in the United States have risen by an average of 15% since the start of the Korean War; the average wholesale price of cotton fabrics has risen by more than 37% in the past six months. Along with the infinite increase in military spending in the American national budget, there is a continuous reduction in financial appropriations for civilian social needs. Expenditures on health care, housing construction, unemployment benefits, and other items, which were already meager, are being repeatedly reduced. Ministers and congressmen are also demanding further cuts in civil administration expenses. The housing panic is getting worse and worse. According to the U.S. Senate Special Committee (which is by no means prone to exaggeration), about six million homes in American cities are already uninhabitable. Even the reactionary American union bosses have to admit that one-third of American residents live in slums.

    American militarization is making the tycoons of American monopoly capital rich. Militarization is subjecting workers to more open and brutal exploitation. All of this, in turn, is sharply intensifying the class struggle. The growth of the American strike movement is its first sign. More and more Americans are beginning to understand day by day that Wall Street's policy of aggression and preparation for war is bringing new disasters, poverty, and hunger to millions of ordinary Americans.

### 华尔街的侵略和备战政策给美国人民带来了新灾难  真理报纽约通讯

　　华尔街的侵略和备战政策给美国人民带来了新灾难
    真理报纽约通讯
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：《真理报》发表拉萨丁与费利波夫的纽约通讯，题为《美国经济军国主义化的结果》。
    记者写道：从一九四八年秋季开始的美国工业生产的衰落，已因政府拨款亿万美元给美国垄断资本家从事扩充军备运动而中止。对朝鲜的军事冒险便是给予扩展军事生产以更强烈的刺激。美国的工业正在为了更加扩充军事生产而动员起来。对朝鲜的军事冒险以及随之而来的军事工业的景气，乃是为美国垄断资本家提供空前利润的源泉。华尔街的大亨之一——杜邦的庞大的化学康采恩（它正接受着原子杀人武器的订货），去年曾获得其有史以来最高的利润。
    随着股票投机、军火商为着有利的合同而互相争夺俱来的，是愈来愈无耻的钻营、舞弊、收买、贿赂。一切政府机关，直至白宫高级官员，都与这种可耻的勾当有关。
    可是，美国军事工业部门的畸形膨大，越来越更险恶地影响着和平的消费工业。政府对民用工业的钢、锰、橡胶的供给实施限制。报纸经济评论家及企业界代表预言一九五一年中许多日用品的产量都将锐减。据政府专家估计，新住宅的建筑数量今年就将缩减百分之四十五。
    美国疯狂的军备扩张和军国主义化，把愈来愈沉重的负担加到美国劳动人民的身上。甚至按照美国反动报纸的经济专家所承认的，近年来美元购买力几乎降低了三分之二。美元购买力的降低，使劳动者的实际工资进一步下降。这种情况在美国侵犯朝鲜以后特别加剧。美国将近有二千万个家庭甚至没有得到最低限度的生活费用，过着悲惨的日子。为了弥补用于扩张军备的庞大拨款和有关扩充军队的支出，杜鲁门政府一再增加新税，而这些赋税的主要负担是落在劳动者身上的。美国统治集团对朝鲜的冒险行动以及美国的加紧军国主义化，已引起物价的新的急剧上涨。据美国报纸统计，自侵朝战争开始以来，美国批发物价已平均上涨了百分之十五，去年六个月中棉织品批发价格平均上涨了百分之三十七以上。随着美国国家预算上军事款项的无限增加而来的，是不断削减用于平民社会需要上的财政拨款。原已少得可怜的保健、住宅建筑、失业津贴等项支出还在一再予以削减。部长及国会议员还要求再削减民政经费。住宅恐慌愈来愈厉害。据美国参院专门委员会（它是决不肯夸大的）所承认的，美国各城市中约有六百万栋住房已经不能居住了。甚至美国反动工会头子也不得不承认，美国居民三分之一是住在贫民窟中的。
    美国军国主义化使美国垄断资本的大亨们大发横财。军国主义化使劳动者受到更加公开而残酷的掠夺。所有这一切，反转来又使阶级斗争急剧地尖锐化。美国罢工运动的增长，乃是其第一个标志。愈来愈多的美国人一天天地开始了解，华尔街的侵略政策和准备发动战争的政策带给美国千百万普通人们以新的灾难、贫困和饥饿。
