　　Speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing
    (February 28, 1951)
         Liu Shaoqi
    Chairman, fellow representatives!
    First of all, please allow me to extend my warm greetings and congratulations to the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing!
    We are very grateful to you, grateful to the people of the capital! Because the central government organs have received a lot of help from all sectors of the capital, they have been able to set up their offices here and carry out work for more than a year. However, this has also caused some difficulties for the people of the capital, the most significant of which is the difficulty with housing. Many people have raised this difficulty with us, and we also believe that the government should cooperate with the people to gradually solve this problem. I heard that your meeting has discussed this issue, which is very good. I think this problem can be gradually solved.
    The Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing has taken a further step on its democratic foundation compared to the previous two sessions. The number of representatives has increased, 83 percent of the representatives are elected by the people, and only 17 percent of the representatives are invited through consultation, of which only 3 percent represent the government. The people of the capital, having had the experience of the past two years and two People's Representative Conferences, have begun to become familiar with the political representatives among them, so it has become possible for them to conduct such elections. The way they elect representatives is that in public factories, enterprises, and colleges, direct elections are held by the electoral assembly based on the production unit or school, while farmers in the suburbs, business and industry representatives, youth, women representatives, and regional representatives are elected by the electoral representative conference. During the election, except for the schools where all voters are literate and have had multiple election experiences, which adopted secret ballot voting, in other places, the method of raising hands was used after discussing the list of candidates. I think this is completely correct and necessary. In this way, the People's Representative Conference, as the main organizational form of the Beijing People's Democratic regime, is more broadly and closely connected with the masses of the people in its organizational foundation, and it is also more complete in its organizational form than the previous two sessions. If the representative conference also discusses and solves more problems among the people, and if the government committee and the consultative committee it elects can faithfully fulfill the resolutions of the representative conference, then we can imagine that it will further enhance its prestige among the people, and it has taken a big step forward in the construction of the people's democratic regime. This is something worth celebrating.
    I think that not only should the People's Representative Conference of Beijing be like this, but also in other places, wherever the conditions are already in place, People's Representative Conferences should be convened in this way. In cities where the people already have considerable organization, in rural areas where land reform has been completed, when the people have begun to be able to elect their own representatives, they should not hesitate to let the people directly or indirectly elect representatives to people's representative conferences at all levels. The method of election can also largely adopt the experience of Beijing.
    Speaking of elections, some people often think of the old slogan of "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot voting." Undoubtedly, in the past, under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary dictatorial regime, putting forward this propaganda slogan to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial regime had its progressive significance. However, if this slogan is taken to the current New Democratic regime and demanded to be implemented immediately, it is still not entirely suitable for the current actual situation of the Chinese people, and therefore cannot be fully adopted. Most of the Chinese people, mainly the working people, are illiterate, have no election experience in the past, and their concern and enthusiasm for elections are also not very sufficient for the time being. If, under such circumstances, we universally register voters, mechanically delineate electoral districts, and uniformly use secret ballot voting to directly elect representatives to people's congresses at all levels, according to our past experience in implementing this in some areas, such elections are rather formalistic. It gives people many unnecessary troubles, damages the people's enthusiasm, and in reality cannot make the people's congress thus elected have more of a representative nature, and therefore cannot use this method to make today's people's regime more democratic and more closely connected with the people. The old democrats of the bourgeoisie pay attention to this set of formalistic methods, and they are often satisfied with this set of forms, so that they can manipulate the elections, and implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie in the name of representing the people. However, we are New Democrats, and what we pay attention to first is not this set of election forms, but its essence, that is to say, to enable the people, mainly the working people, to truly elect the people they are willing to elect to represent themselves, and to have the representatives faithfully reflect their opinions and requirements to the government. As long as the election can truly achieve this, we will not haggle over the method of election, and will adopt the methods that the masses are familiar with and convenient as much as possible to carry out the election. This election method in Beijing proves to be convenient for the people and is a method that can be adopted at present. The election method of "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot voting" cannot be adopted immediately in the current situation in China, and should not be adopted. This can only be fully implemented after all the preparatory work has been done, and most of the Chinese people have undergone a long period of election training and are basically literate. In the near future, we can only gradually do all kinds of preparatory work based on the actual situation among the majority of the Chinese people, and gradually implement more universal, equal, direct or indirect elections using the method of raising hands to vote. The representatives of people's representative conferences at all levels elected by the people should be ordered to frequently and closely contact their voters, reflect the people's requirements and opinions to the government, and explain the government's policies and the resolutions of the people's representative conferences to the people. People's governments and consultative committees at all levels should establish specialized and capable organs to properly handle every requirement raised by the people to the government, answer the people's letters, and receive the people in a convenient way. In this way, the people's governments at all levels can be closely connected with the people and serve the people practically, and the broad masses of the people can also manage their own affairs and the affairs of the state through the people's representative conferences and the people's governments at all levels. This is what we can gradually achieve at present. In this way, the representativeness of people's representative conferences and people's governments at all levels can be expanded without limit.
    The system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses is the basic system of our country, and is the best and most basic organizational form of the people's democratic regime. Our country is a country of the system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses. The current people's representative conferences at all levels are acting on behalf of the powers of the people's congresses at all levels, and in the near future, they will directly transition to the people's congresses at all levels. The people's governments at all levels, all democratic parties, and the people of all democratic classes should, in accordance with the Common Program and the laws and decrees promulgated by the Central People's Government, and in accordance with the actual possible conditions in various places, actively and diligently establish people's representative conferences at all levels practically and not just formally, so that it can be politically and organizationally more broadly and closely connected with the masses of the people of all democratic classes, and gradually make it perfect in its organizational form, so that the current people's representative conferences at all levels can gradually transition to people's congresses at all levels in the next few years—people's congresses that can fully represent the people in exercising political power at all levels. In this way, we can rely on the system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses, a system with great effectiveness, to closely unite the people of the whole country around the people's governments at all levels, and under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, form a strong unified force to fulfill the construction tasks and defense tasks that our people urgently need to fulfill. In this way, we will have no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and no tasks that cannot be completed. The system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses formulated by Chairman Mao Zedong, which is completely suitable for the current national conditions of China, will guarantee the long-term victory of our country and people.
    The state system of the New Democratic people's representative conferences and congresses has proven, and will prove in future history, that it is incomparably superior to any old democratic parliamentary system, and it is ten thousand times more democratic to the people than the old democratic parliamentary system.
    In order to establish this system in our country, and to make this system a systematic, regular, and consolidated system from the bottom up as quickly as possible, people's governments at all levels must regularly convene people's representative conferences at all levels in accordance with the regulations of the Central People's Government's laws and organizational regulations. According to local experience, such people's representative conferences should be convened at least three times a year in large cities, four times in medium and small cities, at least once a year in provinces, at least twice a year in counties, and districts and townships can be convened according to regulations. I'm talking about at least, of course, it can be opened more often. Experience has also proven that cities with a population of more than 100,000 should convene people's representative conferences in various urban and suburban areas in order to deal with many specific problems among the people that are very important in the eyes of the people, and these problems are often difficult for the city's people's representative conferences and people's governments to deal with, and must be dealt with by the district people's representative conferences and district people's governments. In order to ensure that people's representative conferences at all levels can be convened regularly, people's governments at all levels should instruct the civil affairs departments to supervise lower-level governments, and stipulate dates for lower-level governments to report to themselves on the people's representative conferences. Because some government workers are not very willing to convene people's representative conferences, they are accustomed to a few people taking care of everything, and are not accustomed to discussing things with the people's representatives. They think that convening people's representative conferences is "too troublesome," they use the excuse of "too much work," or they use the excuse of "nothing to do," and do not convene people's representative conferences. For these people, the higher levels must supervise them. Otherwise, they will not convene people's representative conferences according to the stipulated time. Those who fail to convene people's representative conferences according to the stipulated time without sufficient reason should be criticized or even punished. If there is sufficient reason to postpone the convening, it must also be reported to the higher-level people's government for approval. In this way, we can ensure that people's representative conferences at all levels can be convened regularly. According to local experience, as long as people's representative conferences at all levels can be convened, there are benefits. The vast majority of them in the past were opened very well, and there were great benefits in all aspects. But there are also a few that are not well opened or not very well opened, but there is also one benefit, it can expose the shortcomings in the work of these places and the bureaucracy of the government workers, it can supervise and educate the government workers in these places and attract the attention of the higher levels, so that the work in these places may be transformed. Therefore, people's representative conferences at all levels should be convened on time whether there is something to do or not. "Too much work" should be convened even more, so as to mobilize more people and unite the activists among the people to do these so-called too many work in separate ways. Therefore, unless there are certain emergency situations that make us unable to temporarily change the regular way of working, and have to temporarily postpone the convening of the people's representative conferences, in all normal circumstances, we must abide by this important system of our country and convene people's representative conferences at all levels on time. We must make people's representative conferences at all levels (in the rural areas where land reform is being carried out, it is the peasant representative conference) the central link in all the work and all the activities of people's governments at all levels. All the work and all the activities of the people's governments at all levels should be reported to the people's representative conferences at all levels, and accept their inquiries and deliberations. The important work and activities should also be discussed and resolved by the people's representative conferences in advance, and then everyone should unite and go to implement them.
    In addition, please also note that the further democratization of the Beijing People's Democratic regime is being carried out under the conditions of military control. Some people feel that if military control is to be implemented, democracy should not or cannot be implemented. Or they say that democracy cannot be implemented when the country is in a military period. They regard the military control of the People's Liberation Army as something that is absolutely opposed and incompatible with the implementation and development of the people's democratic politics. This view is completely wrong. China is still in a military period today, the war is still actually going on in some places, and the whole country is still in a period of military control. However, we are also implementing democracy very well in various places across the country, convening people's representative conferences at all levels on time, and carrying out the election of people's representative conferences at all levels, handing over the country's and local policies to the people and the people's representative conferences for full discussion and decision. On the one hand, war and military control have not hindered the people from implementing democracy. On the other hand, the people's implementation of democracy has not hindered war and military control. On the contrary, the two help and strengthen each other. What is the reason for this? This is because our military control is the people's military control. The People's Liberation Army itself is the people's army. The military control of the People's Liberation Army is a ruthless and open military dictatorship against the enemy and the reactionaries, and for the people, it means the people's democracy. Not only will it not have any restrictions or inconvenience for the people, on the contrary, it protects the people, relieves the people from the oppression and restrictions of the old forces, provides great convenience to the people, encourages the people to rise up and be the masters, take their own and the country's destiny into their own hands, and manage their own affairs and the country's affairs themselves. Chairman Mao Zedong said in his article on People's Democratic Dictatorship that the People's Democratic Dictatorship has two aspects, namely the democratic aspect towards the people and the dictatorial aspect towards the reactionaries. The military control of the People's Liberation Army is the initial People's Democratic Dictatorship. It forcefully suppresses the reactionaries. At the same time, it does everything possible to protect, encourage, and help the people establish people's representative conferences and people's governments at all levels, and gradually transfer power to the people's government organs at all levels when conditions are ripe. When the counter-revolution has been eliminated, the land reform has been completed, most of the people have been organized, and the people's representative conferences and the people's governments at all levels can fully perform their duties, then military control will naturally become unnecessary, and all its powers will naturally be replaced by the people's governments at all levels. Therefore, our military control not only does not hinder the convening of people's representative conferences at all levels, on the contrary, one of its main tasks is to convene people's representative conferences at all levels and establish people's political power at all levels. Therefore, the argument that the people's representative conferences are not convened on the grounds of military control or military period is wrong.
    Economic construction has now become the central task of our country and people. However, the New Democratic economic construction must be led and guaranteed by the New Democratic regime. Without New Democratic politics, there can be no New Democratic economy, that is, there can be no economy that combines the five economic components led by the socialist state-owned economy. This is also a prominent feature that distinguishes our New Democratic revolution from the past bourgeois revolutions. Before the bourgeois revolution, that is, before the establishment of the bourgeois regime, the capitalist economy existed and developed. However, the New Democratic economy led by the socialist state-owned economy can only be organized and developed after the establishment of the New Democratic state power led by the working class. The construction of the New Democratic regime, the development of the people's democratic regime, the democratization of our country, and the New Democratic economic construction, the development of the people's economic undertakings, and the industrialization of our country cannot be separated. Without the democratization of our country, without the development of the New Democratic regime, we cannot guarantee the New Democratic economic development and the industrialization of the country. Conversely, the New Democratic economic development and the industrialization of the country will greatly strengthen and consolidate the foundation of the New Democratic regime. Therefore, our basic slogan is: Democratization and industrialization! Here, democratization and industrialization cannot be separated. Long live the free and prosperous New China! Long live the state system of People's Representative Conferences and People's Congresses! (Xinhua News Agency)

　　在北京第三届人民代表会议上的讲话
    （一九五一年二月二十八日）
         刘少奇
    主席、各位代表！
    首先，请让我向北京市第三届人民代表会议致以热忱的敬礼和祝贺！
    我们很感谢你们，感谢首都的人民！因为中央人民政府各机关取得首都各界人民很多的帮助，所以它们能够在这里安排下自己的办公处并进行了一年多的工作。然而这也引起了首都人民一些困难，最显著的就是房屋的困难。不少的人民已向我们提出了这种困难，我们也认为应由政府与人民合作来逐步地解决这个问题，听说你们的会议已对这个问题进行了讨论，这是很好的。我想这个问题是能够逐步地加以解决的。
    北京市第三届人民代表会议在它的民主化的基础上比前两届是更进了一步的。代表的人数增加了，百分之八十三的代表是由人民选举的，只有百分之十七的代表是经协商邀请的，其中只有百分之三的代表是代表政府的。首都的人民，由于有了过去两年和两届人民代表会议的经验，开始熟悉了他们中间的政治代表人物，所以他们进行这种选举就已开始成为可能。他们选举代表的方式，在公营工厂企业和专科以上学校，是以生产或学校为单位由选民大会直接选举，而郊区农民及工商界、青年、妇女代表和区域代表，则由选民代表会议选举。在选举时，除开各学校因选民全部识字又有过多次选举经验采用了无记名投票而外，在其他地方，则在讨论了候选名单之后，都是采用举手表决的方式。我认为这样作是完全正确的和必要的。这样，就使作为北京人民民主政权主要组织形式的人民代表会议在组织基础上更广大、更密切地联系了人民群众，在组织形式上也比以前两届更完备了一些。如果代表会议又讨论了和解决了人民中间更多的问题，它所选举的政府委员会和协商委员会又能忠实履行代表会议的决议，那末，我们就可以想像：它将在人民中更加提高自己的威信，它在人民民主政权的建设过程中就已前进了一大步。这是值得大家庆贺的。
    我认为不独北京的人民代表会议应该如此，在其他地方，凡是条件业已具备了的，也应该如此地来召集人民代表会议。在人民已经有了相当组织的城市，在土地改革已经完成了的乡村，人民已经开始能够选出自己的代表的时候，就应该不迟疑地让人民直接地或间接地来选举各级人民代表会议的代表。选举的方式，也大体上可以采用北京的经验。
    说到选举，有些人就常常想到“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”这句老口号。无疑问，过去在蒋介石反动的独裁政权底下，提出这个宣传口号去反对蒋介石的独裁政权，那是有它的进步意义的。但是这个口号如果拿到今天新民主主义的政权底下要求立即实行，对于中国人民中目前的实际情况则是还不完全适合的，因而也是不能完全采用的。中国大多数人民，主要是劳动人民还不识字，过去没有选举的经验，他们对于选举的关心和积极性暂时也还不很充分，如果在这种情形下，就来普遍的登记选民，机械地划定选区，按人口比例一律用无记名投票的办法来直接选举各级人民代表大会的代表，根据我们过去在若干地区实行过的经验，这样的选举反而是形式主义的，它给人民许多不必要的麻烦，损害人民的积极性，在实际上并不能使这样选举产生的人民代表大会具有更多的代表人民的性质，因而也就不能用这种办法使今天的人民政权更加民主化，更加密切地联系人民。资产阶级的旧民主主义者是注重这一套形式主义的办法的，他们也常常满足于这一套形式，以便他们能够在选举中加以操纵，假代表人民之名来实行资产阶级专政之实。然而我们是新民主主义者，我们首先注重的不是这一套选举的形式，而是它的实质，就是说，要使人民，主要使劳动人民真能选举他们所乐意选举的人去代表自己，并要代表能忠实地把他们的意见和要求反映到政府中去。只要选举能真实地作到这一点，我们就不在选举的方式上去斤斤计较，而尽可能地采用群众所熟悉的和便利的方式去进行选举。北京的这种选举方式，证明对于人民是便利的，是在目前可以采用的方式。“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的选举方式，在中国目前的情况下还不能因而也不应该一下采用。这只有在各种准备工作均已做好，中国大多数的人民经过了相当长期的选举训练并大体识字之后，才能最后地完全地实行这种选举方式，在最近的将来，我们还只能依据中国大多数人民中的实际情况，逐步地做好各种准备工作，并逐步地实行更加普遍的、平等的、直接的或间接的、用举手表决方式的选举。对于被人民选举出来的各级人民代表会议的代表，要责令他们经常地、密切地联系自己的选民，向政府反映人民的要求和意见，并将政府的政策、人民代表会议的决议向人民作解释。各级人民政府和协商委员会要建立专门的有能力的机关来适当处理每个人民向政府所提出的要求，答复人民的来信，并用方便的办法接见人民。这样，使各级人民政府密切地联系人民，切实地为人民服务，而广大的人民也就可以经过各级人民代表会议和人民政府来管理自己的事务和国家的事务。这是我们在目前就能逐步地达到的。这样，就能无限制地扩大各级人民代表会议和人民政府的代表性。
    人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，是我们国家的基本制度，是人民民主政权的最好的基本的组织形式，我们的国家就是人民代表会议与人民代表大会制的国家。目前的各级人民代表会议已在代行各级人民代表大会的职权，在不久的将来，就要直接地过渡为各级人民代表大会。各级人民政府，各民主党派，各民主阶级的人民，都应该依据共同纲领和中央人民政府颁布的法令，按照各个地方实际可能的情况，积极地努力地把各级人民代表会议实际地而不只是形式地建立起来，使它在政治上和组织上更广大更密切地联系各民主阶级的人民群众，在组织形式上也逐步地使它完备起来，使目前的各级人民代表会议能够在最近几年内逐步地过渡为各级人民代表大会——完全能够代表人民行使各级政权的人民代表大会。这样，就能依靠人民代表会议与人民代表大会这一个有伟大功效的制度把全国人民紧密地团结在各级人民政府的周围，在中央人民政府的统一领导之下，形成为一个强大的统一的力量，去履行我们全国人民迫切需要履行的建设任务和国防任务。这样，我们就没有任何困难是不能克服的，也没有任何任务不能完成。由毛泽东主席所制订的完全适合中国目前国情的人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，将保证我们国家和人民的长远胜利。
    新民主主义的人民代表会议与代表大会的国家制度，已经证明，在将来的历史上还会要证明它是比任何旧民主主义的议会制度要无比优越的，对人民来讲，它比旧民主主义的议会制度要更加民主一万倍。
    为了在我们国家建立这种制度，并使这种制度尽可能迅速地成为我们国家从下至上的系统的经常的巩固的制度，各级人民政府必须依照中央人民政府的法令和组织通则的规定经常定期地召集各级人民代表会议，根据各地经验，这种人民代表会议在大城市每年至少应召集三次，中小城市应召集四次，省每年至少应召集一次，县每年至少应召集两次，区乡可按规定召开。我说的是至少，当然还可以多开。经验还证明：有十万人口以上的城市应召集各城区和郊区的人民代表会议，以便处理人民中许多具体的在人民看来是很重要的问题，而这些问题常常是市人民代表会议和人民政府难于处理的，须由各区人民代表会议和区人民政府来处理。为了保证各级人民代表会议能经常召开，各级人民政府应责成民政部门对下级政府加以督促，并规定日期要下级政府向自己作关于人民代表会议的报告。因为有些政府工作人员是不大愿意召开人民代表会议的，他们习惯于少数人包办一切，而不习惯于和人民的代表商量办事，他们认为召开人民代表会议“太麻烦”，他们借口“工作太忙”，或又借口“没有事”，而不召开人民代表会议，对于这些人，必须由上级加以督促。否则，他们就不按规定时间召开人民代表会议。对于没有充分理由而不按规定时间召开人民代表会议者，应给以批评以至处分。如有充分理由必须推迟召开者，亦须报告上级人民政府批准。如此，就能保证各级人民代表会议能经常定期召开。根据各地经验，各级人民代表会议只要能够召开，就有好处，过去绝大多数都开得很好，对各方面都有很大的好处。但也有少数开得不好或不大好的，然而也有一种好处，它可以暴露这些地方工作上的缺点和政府工作人员的官僚主义，它可以督促和教育这些地方的政府工作人员并引起上级的注意，因而就使这些地方的工作有可能获得转变。因此，各级人民代表会议不论有事无事都应按期召开，“工作太多”更应召开，以便动员更多的人民和团结人民中的积极分子把这些所谓太多的工作分头地去作好。所以除非是有某些紧急情况发生使我们不能不暂时改变经常的工作方式，得暂时推迟人民代表会议的召开而外，在一切通常的情况下，均必须遵守我们国家这项重要的制度，按期召开各级人民代表会议。要使各级人民代表会议（在土地改革的乡区是农民代表会议）成为各级人民政府一切工作和一切活动的中心环节。各级人民政府的一切工作和一切活动应向各级人民代表会议作报告，并接受其质询和审议，其重要的工作和活动还预先经过人民代表会议的讨论和决议，然后大家团结一致地去加以执行。
    此外，还请各位注意到：北京人民民主政权更加走向民主化，是在军事管制的条件之下进行的。有些人觉得：既要实行军事管制就不应或不能实行民主。或者说：国家处在军事时期，就不能实行民主。他们把人民解放军的军事管制与人民民主政治的实行和发展看作是绝对对立、彼此不相容的东西。这种观点是完全错误的。中国今天还是处在军事时期，战争还在一些地方实际地进行着，全国也还在军事管制时期，然而我们在全国各地又正在很好地实行着民主，按期召开各级人民代表会议，并要进行各级人民代表会议的选举，把国家的和地方的各种政策交给人民和人民的代表会议去作充分的讨论和决定。一方面，战争和军事管制并没有妨害人民实行民主，另一方面，人民实行民主也并没有妨害战争和军事管制。相反，它们二者倒是相互帮助、相互加强的。这是什么缘故呢？这是因为我们的军事管制是人民的军事管制。人民解放军本身就是人民的军队，人民解放军的军事管制对于敌人和反动派来说，它是无情的公开的军事专政，对于人民来说，它就是意味着人民的民主。它对于人民不独不会有什么束缚和不方便，相反，它保护人民，替人民解除旧势力的压迫和束缚，给人民极大的方便，鼓舞人民起来作主人，把自己的和国家的命运操在自己手中，由他们自己来管理自己的事务和国家的事务。毛泽东主席在论人民民主专政的文章上说：人民民主专政有两个方面，即对人民内部的民主方面和对反动派的专政方面。人民解放军的军事管制就是最初的人民民主专政，它强力地镇压反动派，它同时竭尽一切方法保卫、鼓励和帮助人民建立各级人民代表会议和人民政府，并且在条件成熟时逐步地把权力移交给各级人民政府机关。在反革命已经肃清，土地改革已经完结，人民大多数已有组织，各级人民代表会议和人民政府已能完全履行自己的职权，那时，军事管制就自然地成为不必要了，它的一切权力也就自然而然地为各级人民政府所代替了。所以我们的军事管制不独不妨害各级人民代表会议的召集，相反，它的主要任务之一就是要召集各级人民代表会议，建立各级人民政权。所以借口军事管制或军事时期而不召开人民代表会议的说法，是不对的。
    经济建设现已成为我们国家和人民的中心任务。但是新民主主义的经济建设必须有新民主主义的政权来领导和保障，没有新民主主义的政治，就不能有新民主主义的经济，即不能有以社会主义的国营经济为领导的五种经济成份相结合的经济。这也是我们的新民主主义革命区别于过去资产阶级革命的一个显著特点。在资产阶级革命即资产阶级政权建立以前，就存在着并发展着资本主义经济，但是以社会主义的国营经济为领导的新民主主义经济，就只有在以工人阶级为领导的新民主主义的国家政权建立之后，才能加以组织并使之发展。新民主主义的政权建设，人民民主政权的发展，我们国家的民主化，和新民主主义的经济建设，人民经济事业的发展，我们国家的工业化，是不能分离的。没有我们国家的民主化，没有新民主主义的政权的发展，就不能保障新民主主义的经济发展和国家的工业化。反过来，新民主主义的经济发展和国家的工业化，又要大大地加强和巩固新民主主义政权的基础。因此，我们的基本口号是：民主化与工业化！在我们这里，民主化与工业化是不能分离的。自由和富强的新中国万岁！人民代表会议与人民代表大会的国家制度万岁！ （新华社）
