The workers of the Wuxi Joint State-Private Hua Chang Silk Factory, in the patriotic labor emulation campaign, used the "Li" reeling machine to produce Grade Four-A silk (with Grade A being the best, and more "A"s indicating better quality), and used the "Sitting" reeling machine to produce Grade Three-A silk, creating the highest quality record for raw silk products in the country in the fourteen years since the start of the Anti-Japanese War. In January, the raw silk produced by the factory, after inspection by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Central Ministry of Trade, showed that Grade Double-A and above silk accounted for over 53%. Among them were five pieces each of Grade Four-A and Grade Three-A silk.

　　On February 20, all the staff and workers of the factory wrote letters reporting this achievement to Chairman Mao, Honorary Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the superior trade union, and received letters of commendation from Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union.

　　无锡公私合营华昌丝厂工人
    创抗战后生丝品质最高纪录
    全国总工会刘少奇主席写信嘉勉
    无锡公私合营的华昌丝厂工人在爱国主义劳动竞赛中，用立缫车缫出四甲级丝（丝的品级以甲级最好，甲字多更好），用坐缫车缫出三甲级丝，创造抗日战争开始以后十四年来全国生丝产品质量的最高纪录。一月份该厂所出生丝，经中央贸易部上海商品检验局检验结果，双甲级以上生丝即占百分之五十三强。其中有四甲级和三甲级丝各五件。
    该厂全体职工曾在二月二十日写信将这一成绩分别报告了毛主席、全国总工会刘少奇名誉主席和上级工会，并得到刘少奇主席和中国纺织工会全国委员会复信嘉勉。（新华社）
