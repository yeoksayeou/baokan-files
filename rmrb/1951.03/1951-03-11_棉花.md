　　Cotton
        Liu Jie
    Cotton is the second most important crop in China's agricultural production, after grain, and it also occupies a very important position in economic construction.
    China's cotton-growing areas are widely distributed. Generally, they are divided into five regions: the Yellow River cotton region, the Yangtze River cotton region, the Northeast cotton region, the Northwest cotton region, and the Southwest cotton region. The Yellow River cotton region includes provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, with Hebei, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces producing the most cotton. The Yangtze River cotton region includes provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, with Jiangsu and Hubei provinces producing the most cotton. The Northeast cotton region is mainly in the four provinces of southern Manchuria, namely Liaoning, Liaoxi, Jilin, and Rehe, as well as the southeastern part of Inner Mongolia, with Liaoning and Liaoxi provinces producing the most cotton. Although the climate in northern Manchuria is cold, cotton can still be planted. Jin Junxi, a special-class labor model in Songjiang Province, has successfully trial-planted cotton in Ning'an County at 44 degrees 01 minutes north latitude, with a yield of 182 jin of seed cotton per mu (three jin of seed cotton equals one jin of lint cotton), which is 62 jin more than the average yield in southern Manchuria, breaking the "theory" of the puppet Manchurian experts that cotton cannot be planted north of 43 degrees 40 minutes. The Northwest cotton region includes Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, with Xinjiang producing more cotton. The Southwest cotton region includes Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces, but the yield is relatively small.
    China's cotton-producing areas are wide and the yield is abundant. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the highest record for cotton fields was 59.31 million mu in 1937, and the highest record for cotton production was 16.97 million dan (lint cotton) in 1936, ranking third in the world. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large amount of American cotton came along with the U.S. imperialist "relief supplies," manipulating the domestic cotton market and destroying cotton production. In 1946, China's cotton imports increased to 5.628 million dan. In addition, bureaucratic capital used government power to purchase at limited prices, and landlords rented out cotton-planting land at high prices. Under these triple exploitation and oppression, cotton farmers had to abandon cotton planting and switch to other crops. As a result, the cotton fields decreased significantly. At the same time, cotton requires careful cultivation, and cotton farmers, being plundered and bankrupt, were unable to pay a large amount of capital, resulting in a sharp decline in cotton production. By 1948, the country only produced 8.5 million dan of lint cotton.
    After the basic liberation of the mainland, with the vigorous support of the People's Government, the appropriate ratio of cotton to grain prices was guaranteed, and cotton production was quickly restored and developed. In 1950, the national lint cotton production had reached more than 80% of the highest pre-war production. In individual regions, such as Hebei Province, before the war in 1936, 10.3 million mu of cotton were planted, producing 3 million dan of lint cotton, while in 1950, the province's actual cotton planting area was 12 million mu, producing a total of 3.36 million dan of lint cotton. Both the cotton planting area and cotton production have exceeded the highest pre-war levels.
    China's cotton varieties are relatively mixed, with the most planted being Zhongmian cotton and American cotton.
    Zhongmian cotton, the fiber color is white and milky yellow, slightly silky, and the secondary is not silky. The fiber length is generally from three-eighths to three-quarters of an inch, the twist is poor, and the tensile strength is weak, which can only spin coarse yarn of 14 to 10 counts or less, or spin wool cotton thread; improved Zhongmian cotton can spin 24-count yarn. The improved varieties promoted in various places include: Qingjing Jijiaomian, Jiangyin Baizimian, Xiaogan Guangzi Longrongmian, Baiwan Huamian, and Hebei Dingxian No. 114 and other varieties.
    American cotton fiber is white in color and silky, with a fiber length of seven-eighths to one inch being the most common, and the longer ones reaching one and one-sixteenth to one and five-thirty-seconds, which can spin fine yarn of 24 counts or more to 42 counts. The excellent varieties promoted in various places include: Tuozimian, Aizimian, Jinzimian, Dezimian, Sizimian, Kezimian, Daizimian and other varieties.
    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, along with the sharp decline in cotton production came the degradation and mixing of improved varieties. Now, the People's Government attaches great importance to the leadership of cotton production. In addition to organizing cotton farmers to prevent and control cotton insects, irrigate, fertilize, and cultivate carefully, special attention is paid to improving cotton seeds. Taking North China as an example, last year, 1.5 million jin of improved cotton seeds were promoted, sowing 1.8 million mu, accounting for 10% of the total cotton field area; the average yield per mu increased by 10 jin to 20 jin. If only 10 jin are counted, the yield of seed cotton will increase by 180,000 dan. During the autumn harvest, in addition to the masses in the promotion area retaining seeds for their own use, 26.83 million jin of improved seeds were selected and collected, which can increase the production of 330,000 dan of seed cotton in 1951.
    The future of China's cotton production is infinitely broad. First of all, China has a modern textile foundation and needs a large supply of raw cotton. In terms of domestic market needs, with the end of land reform, production in the new rural areas will be rapidly restored and developed, and farmers' purchasing power will gradually increase. After the bumper harvest in the old areas, farmers' purchasing power has greatly increased. Taking the Northeast as an example, after the land reform, 800,000 bolts of cloth were sold in 1947, 1.2 million bolts in 1948, 3.2 million bolts in 1949, and it increased to 9.02 million bolts in 1950. From this increase in yarn and cloth sales, it can be affirmed that increasing cotton production is the most important thing in the future. At the same time, under the correct cotton-grain price ratio policy of the People's Government, cotton farmers also get more profit than other crops. This guarantees the possibility of increased cotton production. According to the results of the "comparing output and carefully calculating accounts" by cotton farmers in Yaocun, Sanqu, Xia County, Shanxi Province, planting one mu of cotton is equal to four mu of land.
    The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued a decision on agricultural and forestry production in 1951, requiring an increase in cotton production by 36.9% this year on the basis of last year. This is a guarantee for the supply of raw materials for China's current textile industry. Governments at all levels should vigorously organize and mobilize, help farmers solve various difficulties in production, improve seeds and cultivation methods, and correctly grasp prices in accordance with the instructions on guaranteeing the cotton-grain price ratio issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and strive to complete this year's cotton production increase plan.

　　棉花
        刘捷
    棉花是我国农业生产中仅次于粮食的作物，在经济建设上也占着很重要的地位。
    我国棉区分布甚广。一般划分为五个区，即：黄河流域棉区、长江流域棉区、东北棉区、西北棉区、西南棉区。黄河流域棉区包括陕西、山西、河南、平原、河北、山东等省，其中以河北、山东、陕西三省产棉最盛。长江流域棉区包括四川、湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏、浙江等省，其中以江苏、湖北两省产棉最多。东北棉区主要在南满的辽东、辽西、吉林、热河四省及内蒙的东南部，其中以辽东、辽西两省产棉最多；北满气候虽冷，亦能植棉。松江省特等劳动模范金俊熙已在北纬四十四度零一分的宁安县试种棉花成功，每亩产籽棉一百八十二斤（三斤籽棉折合一斤皮棉），较南满平均产量尚多六十二斤，打破伪满专家在四十三度四十分以北不能植棉的“理论”。西北棉区包括新疆、甘肃、宁夏三省，以新疆产棉较多。西南棉区有云南、广西、广东等省，惟产量较微。
    我国产棉区既广，产量亦丰。抗战以前棉田最高纪录为一九三七年的五千九百三十一万亩，棉花产量最高纪录为一九三六年的一千六百九十七万担（皮棉），居世界第三位。抗战胜利后，随美帝国主义“救济物资”而俱来的大量美棉，操纵了国棉市场，破坏了棉花生产，一九四六年我国进口棉花增至五百六十二万八千担；加之，官僚资本运用政府权势以限价收买；地主以高价出租植棉土地，棉农在此三重剥削和压迫下，不得不放弃植棉，改种其他作物。因此，棉田大量减少。同时，棉花需要精耕细作，棉农在这被掠夺而破产的情况下，无力付出很大资本，因此形成棉产锐减，至一九四八年，全国仅产皮棉八百五十万担。
    大陆基本解放后，经人民政府的大力扶植，保证了棉粮适当的比价，棉产得到很快的恢复与发展。一九五○年全国所产皮棉已达战前最高产量的百分之八十强。个别地区，如河北省，战前一九三六年植棉一千零三十万亩，产皮棉三百万担，而一九五○年全省实际种花面积为一千二百万亩，共产皮棉三百三十六万担。植棉面积及棉花产量均已超过战前的最高水平。
    我国棉花品种较杂，种植最多的有中种棉及美种棉两种。
    中种棉，纤维色泽有白色及乳黄色两种，微有丝光，次者无丝光。纤维长度，普通自八分之三至四分之三英寸，捻曲度较差，拉力弱，仅可纺十四支至十支以下粗纱或纺毛棉线；改良中棉可纺二十四支纱。各地推广的改良品种有：青茎鸡脚棉、江阴白籽棉、孝感光籽长绒棉，百万华棉及河北定县一一四号等品种。
    美种棉纤维色泽白，有丝光，纤维长度，以八分之七至一英寸的最多，长的到一又十六分之一至一又三十二分之五，可纺二十四支以上到四十二支的细纱。各地推广的优良品种有：脱字棉、爱字棉、金字棉、德字棉、斯字棉、珂字棉、岱字棉等品种。
    抗战胜利以后，随棉产锐减而来的便是良种的退化与混杂。现在，人民政府则十分重视棉花生产的领导，除组织棉农防治棉虫、灌溉、施肥、精耕细作外，特别注意改良棉种。以华北为例，去年推广棉花良种一、五○○万斤，播种一八○万亩，占棉田总面积百分之十；平均每亩增收十斤至二十斤，如仅以十斤计即增收籽棉十八万担。秋收时，除在推广区群众自留种外，又选收良种二、六八三万斤，可使一九五一年增产籽棉三十三万担。
    我国棉花生产的前途是无限广阔的。首先，我国有近代化的纺织基础，需要大量原棉供应。就国内市场需要来说，随着土地改革结束后，新区农村的生产将得到迅速地恢复与发展，农民购买力也将随之而逐渐提高。老区在丰收后，农民购买力已经大大提高。如以东北为例，在土地改革后，一九四七年销布八十万匹，一九四八年为一百二十万匹，一九四九年为三百二十万匹，至一九五○年已增加到九百零二万匹。从这一纱布销售量增长数字来看，可以肯定，今后棉花增产是最为重要的。同时，在人民政府的正确棉粮比价政策的掌握下，棉农也得到较其他作物较多的利润。这就保证了棉花增产的可能。据山西省夏县三区姚村棉农经过“比产量细算账”的结果，是植一亩棉等于四亩田。
    中央人民政府政务院发布的关于一九五一年农林生产的决定中，要求今年在去年的基础上增产棉花百分之三十六点九。这是供应我国目前纺织工业原料的保证，各级政府应大力进行组织动员，帮助农民解决生产中的各种困难，改良种籽及栽培方法，并根据政务院财政经济委员会颁布关于保证棉粮比价指示，正确掌握价格，为完成今年棉花增产计划而努力。
