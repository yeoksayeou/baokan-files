    Your recent statement, which states that "it has reaffirmed the historical mission of 500,000 teachers and staff and decided to combine all struggles with the demand for a comprehensive peace treaty and the struggle against rearmament," is entirely correct and in line with the interests of the people of Japan, China, Southeast Asia, and all peace-loving people in the world. On behalf of more than 1.2 million educators in China, I extend my highest respect to you for your struggle for peace and justice and wish you victory in your struggle.
