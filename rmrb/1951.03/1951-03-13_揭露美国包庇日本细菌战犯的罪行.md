Exposing the Crime of the United States Shielding Japanese Bacterial Warfare Criminals
Soviet Union · Fusiling Ski

Editor's note: This article is an introduction to the book "Materials of the Trial of Former Japanese Army Servicemen Charged with Preparing and Using Bacterial Weapons," published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House. The Soviet Union's trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals was held in the city of Khabarovsk from December 25th to 30th, 1949. This article briefly describes the historical facts of the Japanese fascist military's crimes of preparing and using bacterial weapons to harm the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia during World War II; and powerfully exposes the United States' shielding of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals in the manufacture and research of bacterial weapons. These exposed crimes have increasingly deepened the anger and hatred of the Chinese people and peace-loving people of the world towards American and Japanese imperialists, and they are determined to intensify their struggle to completely crush the American plot to rearm Japan and use Japanese war criminals for aggression.

The materials collected at the trial of Japanese war criminals held in Khabarovsk have been published. This book includes preliminary hearing documents (indictments, statements of defendants and witnesses, and documentary evidence), statements of defendants and witnesses in court, conclusions of the inspection committee, speeches of the state prosecutor, speeches of the defense attorneys, and the judgment of the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District.

The trial of twelve war criminals in Khabarovsk revealed the heinous crimes committed by Japanese warlords. During World War II, they manufactured and used bacterial weapons in the Far East. The Japanese imperialist rulers committed these crimes, seriously violating their international obligations under the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, "for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare."

The book "Trial Materials of Former Japanese Army Servicemen" unfolds before the reader the terrible full picture of the serious crimes committed by Japanese imperialists, who not only treacherously violated their own international obligations, but also violated all the rules and customs of war, as well as all concepts of humanity.

In 1936, three aggressive powers—Hitler's Germany, fascist Italy, and imperialist Japan—concluded the notorious Anti-Comintern Pact. This alliance formally expressed their common aggressive conspiracy to establish world hegemony. As recorded in the documents of this book, in the same year, Japanese Emperor Hirohito ordered the organization of secret units to prepare bacterial weapons. To maintain secrecy, one of the units was named the "Kwantung Army Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Department," and the other was called the "Kwantung Army Veterinary Disease Prevention Department." Later, in 1941, these research institutes adopted serial numbers, known as "Unit 731" and "Unit 100." In fact, these two units were equivalent to factories for developing and producing bacterial weapons. These units had many detachments: including the so-called "Unit 1644," namely the units designated "Ei" and "Tama," which worked in Nanjing. The main task of the entire system of secret bacterial factories, ordered by Emperor Hirohito, was entrusted to "Unit 731," headed by Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, a famous Japanese military bacteriologist.

"Unit 731" was stationed near Harbin. All its activities were hidden in extreme secrecy. For this purpose, the personnel in the unit did not wear the identification badges of medical personnel, but only wore ordinary Japanese military uniforms. The unit had three thousand staff members.

The criminal "work" of "Unit 731" was organized on a large scale. It had several departments, equipped with the best Japanese bacterial experts. The first department (i.e., the research department) studied the bacteria of various infectious diseases and designed methods of bacterial warfare. The second department (the so-called experimental department) engaged in experiments on the results obtained by the first department. A special "production department" was tasked with mass-producing disease bacteria. There was a department ridiculously called the "Training and Education Department," which specialized in training military personnel in the use of bacterial weapons in combat.

All the criminal "work" of these Japanese bacterial factories was an attempt to design methods of bacterial warfare to ensure the widespread dissemination of terrible infectious diseases and to promote the death of the maximum number of people. The entire so-called "scientific" activity of the Kwantung Bacterial Unit was subordinate to this abominable and inhuman goal.

Ishii and his henchmen paid special attention to the most terrible and easily spread infectious disease—the plague bacillus. Ishii concluded after a long "research" that the most effective method of spreading the plague bacillus was not direct spreading, but through fleas as a medium. In the preliminary hearing, Kajiwara Ryuji, Chief of the Medical Affairs Department of the Kwantung Army, testified: "Ishii also said to me... a much more effective method of bacterial bombing is not to throw the bacteria 'nakedly,' but to throw them together with a medium, that is, with insects, especially with fleas. Fleas are the most vital insects. After infecting fleas with the plague, they are dropped from airplanes. And the plague bacteria stored in the fleas' bodies can smoothly fall to the ground together with the fleas." (Page 105 – Chinese version, same below) Ishii also meticulously solved the problem of infecting food with germs. "Ishii told me that in this regard, experiments were conducted with cholera bacteria, dysentery bacteria, typhoid bacteria, and paratyphoid bacteria." Kajiwara Ryuji testified: "At that time, vegetables, fruits, fish, and meat were infected with bacteria. The results showed that vegetables, especially leafy vegetables such as cabbage, were most suitable for bacterial warfare; root vegetables were less suitable due to their smooth surfaces; injecting bacteria into foods such as fruits was more effective than infecting the outer skin. According to Ishii, the most appropriate medium for spreading infectious diseases is vegetables, followed by fruits, then fish, and finally meat..." (Page 105) This is the result of the cruel "research" completed by murderer Ishii and his accomplices in "Unit 731."

Japanese imperialism was not limited to experimental research, they also cultivated fleas and bacteria. "Unit 731" possessed 4,500 incubators, which could produce 45 kilograms of fleas in three or four months. To breed such countless fleas, a large number of mice were raised. The unit already had 13,000 mice, and Ishii planned to increase it to 3 million. The bacterial unit prepared large quantities of the most terrible bacteria for use on the battlefield. The "production department" of "Unit 731" alone could produce 300 trillion microorganisms in one production cycle. It is not surprising that Japanese bacterial units used astronomical figures to express their production capacity, not in units, or thousands, or hundreds of millions, but in kilograms of germs. Thousands of kilograms of cholera bacteria or plague bacteria—what could be more disgusting than this? Even a madman would not be crazy enough to do such a thing. However, the highest working capacity of the "production department" of "Unit 731" alone could produce 300 kilograms of plague bacteria, 600 kilograms of anthrax bacteria, 900 kilograms of typhoid bacteria, and one ton of cholera bacteria per month!

The terrible, massive quantities of bacterial colloids in the "production department's" equipment were not simply stored in the coolers of the culture medium to await the time of action. The trial in Khabarovsk irrefutably proved that Japanese imperialism extensively used these bacteria on living people during experiments.

Witness Tamura Tadashi (former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Headquarters) confessed about his inspection of "Unit 731" in June 1945: "General Ishii and three officers accompanied me to inspect the laboratories and production sites...

"During my inspection of the production site, they led me to an internal room where there were special cells with small windows on the doors, and inside were living people chained up. According to Ishii's personal explanation to me, these people were used to experiment with the infectious effects of deadly germs.

"Among these experimental subjects, I saw Chinese and Europeans, and a woman... The people in the cells were lying on the floor in a mess, looking extremely painful and unbearable." (Pages 159-160)

The cruel experiments on living people were conducted at a specially set up firing range near Anda Station. Defendant Kawashima (the notorious former head of the production department of "Unit 731") described these experiments as follows: "For these experiments, fifteen people used for the experiments were transported from the internal prison of the unit, and then tied to pillars planted in the ground at the experimental site... A specially prepared aircraft flew in from the direction of Pingfang Station. When the aircraft flew over the firing range, it dropped about twenty bombs. These bombs all exploded in the air 100 to 200 meters above the ground, and then the plague fleas loaded inside the bombs fell to the ground. At that time, plague fleas were scattered all over the firing range" (Page 267). Nishi Toshihide (head of the training department of the same unit) testified during the trial: "Following the order of the commander of Unit 731, I went to Anda Station in January 1945 and personally witnessed the experiment of infecting with gangrene bacteria... Ten prisoners were used for this experiment at that time. These people were all tied to wooden pillars, facing the wooden pillars, and the wooden pillars were spaced five to ten meters apart. Each prisoner's head was covered with an iron helmet, and the body was covered with an iron plate.

"Except for the buttocks being exposed, the rest of the body was covered. At a distance of about one hundred meters, a fragmentation bomb was detonated using electricity to carry out the infection. All the exposed parts of these ten people were injured... and died from gangrene infection." (Page 303)

"Five or six hundred people were sent to Unit 731 every year." Kawashima Kiyoshi said: "...If a prisoner recovered after being infected with deadly germs, he would inevitably be subjected to repeated experiments until he died of infectious diseases... In any case, no one could ever walk out of this human slaughter factory alive."

"From 1940 to 1945, at least 3,000 people were exterminated through this human slaughter factory due to infection with deadly bacteria. As for how many people were exterminated before 1940, I don't know..." (Pages 120-121)

The Japanese executioners chose victims for their brutal experiments to suit their own purposes. The Japanese Military Police transferred those suspected of having anti-Japanese sentiments but lacking evidence to be brought to court to the death row of the bacterial unit. These included Russians and many Chinese patriots. "We do not know the names of most of the victims," said State Prosecutor Smirnov during the trial, "because anyone who fell into the prison of Ishii's unit immediately lost his name. Each person was only given a number until he died. When he died after being experimented on, the scribe of the first department crossed out his number from the register, the body of the poisoned person was put into the crematorium to be incinerated, and the shackles removed from this dead person were taken to be put on the next victim." (Page 463) The demons of Ishii's unit called these unfortunate victims "logs." This shows that they did not treat them as human beings.

Japanese bacterial units also conducted other criminal experiments on prisoners, especially brutal frostbite experiments. Defendant Nishi Toshihide described this experiment as follows: "...In severe cold weather, that is, when it was as cold as minus 20 degrees Celsius, people detained in the unit's prison were often driven outside, and then their hands were stripped naked and frostbite was induced by artificial cold wind. Subsequently, small sticks were used to beat the frostbitten hands until the beaten hands made a sound similar to that of wood. ...Films were also made about this.

"The film first showed four or five people with shackles being driven into the open air, wearing cotton clothes and their hands bare. Then, a huge fan was used to artificially accelerate the freezing process, and then small sticks were used to beat the frozen hands to check whether they were completely frozen..." (Page 302). These cruel experiments on humans can only be compared with the experiments conducted by the physicians of the Nazi German secret political police in Hitler's concentration camps.

However, in any case, the inhumane crimes of the Japanese imperialists did not stop there. From 1939 to 1945, the Japanese army used bacterial weapons prepared by Ishii's unit in several battles.

The first of these attempts was in 1939, when a Japanese special unit infected the Khalkhin Gol River with virulent typhoid bacteria. In the summer of 1940, "Unit 731" spread plague-infected fleas from airplanes in the Ningbo area (central China), resulting in an epidemic of plague in the area. At Ishii's order, a documentary film about these crimes was made and shown whenever senior officers came to inspect "Unit 731." In the summer of 1941, a plague epidemic occurred in the Changde area of China. In 1942, when the Japanese army carried out a so-called "strategic" retreat in central China, they extensively used bacteria to poison reservoirs, fields, and food left in the area. In 1944, Unit 100 carried out bacterial military sabotage activities against the Soviet Union, releasing poisonous bacteria in the reservoirs of the Sanhe area on the Soviet border. In 1945, in the Hailar area, Unit 100 organized an expedition whose purpose was to carry out bacterial military sabotage against the Mongolian People's Republic. Japanese imperialists had stepped up preparations for anti-Soviet bacterial warfare. Ishii had arrogantly boasted that his unit "could use huge amounts of bacteria to attack Soviet cities..." (Page 159).

At the same time, as shown in the Khabarovsk trial, Japanese aggressors had prepared for bacterial warfare against the United States and Britain. Unit 731 conducted research on the resistance of Anglo-Saxons to infectious diseases; for this purpose, they carried out tests on the properties of the blood of American prisoners of war (Page 279). Japanese imperialism planned to begin their bacterial offensive in 1945. The Japanese aggressors hoped that with the help of bacterial weapons, the trend of the war would be more favorable to them.

The evil plans of the Japanese imperialists did not succeed. In August 1945, the Soviet army gave the Japanese army a swift blow and crushed the Kwantung Army, where Ishii and his accomplices were committing crimes, thus completely shattering their schemes. State Prosecutor Smirnov said in the Khabarovsk trial: "Originally, the moment to use the horrifying power of countless trillions of germs to massacre mankind was very imminent, and the only reason the world was spared the scourge of bacterial warfare was because the Soviet armed forces gave the enemy a devastating, fatal, and swift blow" (Page 504). Yamada Otzō, former commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, confessed during the preliminary hearing: "I believe that if the Soviet Union had not entered the war against Japan at that time, bacterial weapons would have been used against the United States, Britain, and other countries. But because the Soviet Union joined the anti-Japanese war and the Soviet army rapidly penetrated the hinterland of Manchuria, we lost the possibility of using bacterial weapons against the Soviet Union and other countries..." (Page 103).

These are the hateful crimes of the Japanese warlords discovered in the Khabarovsk trial. In the concise language of public documents, reading this book allows us to know these crimes, but it is impossible not to feel shock and indignation, and impossible not to hate these despicable criminals who attempted to make mankind victims of deadly bacteria. Everyone with integrity who reads the materials of the terrible criminal "work" of Japanese war bacteriologists will wholeheartedly respond to the demand to impose the most severe punishment on these criminal villains, and will express great gratitude to the Soviet army for severing the bloody hands of the executioners extended over the heads of mankind.

But the reaction of the American ruling group was completely different. After learning about the crimes of the Japanese military group, these groups attempted to protect Japanese criminals from the punishment they deserved. At the same time, they used all the results of their heinous activities to manufacture bacterial weapons in the United States.

According to newspaper reports, in early 1946, the United States had already obtained the materials of the Japanese bacteriologists' criminal work and had begun to use these materials for experiments on new bacterial weapons, which American scientists were strongly pursuing. Several Japanese and German bacteriologists also participated in this work.

Therefore, it is not surprising that when the issue of Japanese preparation for bacterial warfare arose at the Tokyo trial of most Japanese war criminals, the American representatives attempted to keep it secret. When the criminal experiment of infecting prisoners by "Unit 1644" (Tama Unit) was read out at the Tokyo trial in August 1946, the American prosecutor declared: "At this moment, we do not want to present additional evidence on this issue..." (Page 226). Later, the Soviet prosecutor handed over the report on the work of the Japanese bacterial unit obtained from Japanese war criminals to the American chief prosecutor, Keenan. In any case, the American representative did not submit any additional documents regarding Japan's preparation for bacterial warfare to the military tribunal. State Prosecutor Smirnov observed in the Khabarovsk trial regarding this point: "Probably some important figures were trying to prevent the disclosure of the Japanese warlords' appalling crimes" (Page 480).

The Soviet government demanded that the main organizers and instigators of these major crimes: Emperor Hirohito of Japan, Japanese military generals Ishii, Kitano, Wakamatsu, and Kasahara, be handed over to the International Military Tribunal for trial. The US and British governments, in fact, refused to support the Soviet government's request and shielded the war criminals who harmed mankind.

American imperialism not only did not severely punish Japanese war criminals, but instead emulated them, actively preparing for bacterial warfare. The sinister name of Detrick, the base for the development and manufacture of bacterial weapons in the United States near Washington, is well known. At that time, US Secretary of Defense Johnson admitted that research on the development of bacterial warfare methods was continuing in the United States. The chemical department of the US military spends more than $12 million annually on this terrible work.

Every reader of this book can easily understand what this means. The Japanese "Unit 731," "Unit 100," and "Unit 1644" no longer exist, and the killing experiment camp at Anda Station is empty. But the criminal work of these units is being studied in the United States. American scientists are coldly reviewing the painful records of thousands of innocent victims who were brutally massacred by the executioner Ishii and his accomplices. American military aircraft are learning how to spread bacteria and drop them on the territory of the German Democratic Republic—although not plague bacteria, but certainly pests of potatoes.

The great significance of this book on the Khabarovsk trial lies in the fact that it reveals the crimes of Japanese imperialists and helps readers clearly understand the crimes against humanity that American warmongers and their vassals are planning and committing in secret bases and top-secret laboratories today.

After reading this book, every person of integrity will fight more resolutely for a consolidated and lasting peace, to prevent imperialist aggressors from launching wars, and to prevent the revival of the terrifying forces that bring death and destruction to mankind.

　　揭露美国包庇日本细菌战犯的罪行
    苏联·伏斯林斯基
    编者按：这篇文章是莫斯科外文出版局出版的《日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案审判材料》一书的介绍。苏联对日本细菌战犯的审判，是一九四九年十二月二十五日至三十日在伯力城举行的。这篇文章扼要地叙述了审判材料中关于日本法西斯军人在第二次世界大战期间准备和使用细菌武器以残害中苏和蒙古人民的罪恶史实；并有力地揭露了美国包庇日本细菌战犯进行制造和研究细菌武器的罪行。这些被揭露出来的罪行愈益加深了中国人民及世界爱好和平人民对美、日帝国主义者的愤怒和仇视，并决心为彻底粉碎美国重新武装日本、利用日本战犯进行侵略的阴谋而加紧奋斗。
    在伯力城举行的日本战犯审判所搜集的有关材料已经出版了。这本书包括了预审文件（起诉书、被告与证人的供词和文件证据），被告和证人在法庭上的供词，检验委员会结论，国家公诉人的演词，各辩护人的演词和滨海军区军事法庭的判决书。
    在伯力城举行的对十二名战犯的审判，揭露了日本军阀所犯的丑恶罪行。他们在第二次世界大战中在远东制造和使用细菌武器。日本帝国主义统治者犯了这些罪行，严重地违反着他们在一九二五年六月十七日签署的《关于禁止在战争中使用窒息瓦斯，毒气及细菌武器》的日内瓦议定书的国际义务。
    《前日本陆军军人审判材料》这本书在读者面前展开了日本帝国主义者所犯重大罪行的可怕的全部情景，日本帝国主义不但背信地违反了他们自己应负的国际义务，而且违反了一切战争的法规和惯例，以及一切人道的观念。
    一九三六年，三个侵略的强国——希特勒德国，法西斯意大利和帝国主义日本订立了臭名远扬的《反共产国际》公约。这项盟约正式表示了他们企图建立世界霸权的共同侵略的阴谋。正如本书文件的记载，在同一年，日本天皇裕仁敕令组织准备细菌武器的秘密部队。为保守秘密起见，就将其中一个部队命名为“关东军防疫给水部”，另一个部队则叫作“关东军兽疫预防部”。后来，在一九四一年，这些研究所就采用番号，称为“第七三一部队”和“第一○○部队”。事实上，这二个部队相当于发展和生产细菌武器的工厂。这些部队有许多支队：其中有所谓“第一六四四部队”即番号称为“荣”字和“多摩”的部队，在南京工作。细菌秘密工厂整个系统的主要任务，由天皇裕仁命令交给日本著名军事细菌学专家石井四郎中将为首的“第七三一部队”。
    “第七三一部队”驻在哈尔滨附近。它的全部活动均隐藏在极端秘密中。为了这个目的，部队中的人员不佩带医务人员的识别章，而只穿了日本军队的普通军服。部队有三千个工作人员。
    “第七三一部队”的罪恶“工作”是大规模地组织起来的。它设有几个部，配备着日本最优秀的细菌专家。第一部（即研究部）研究各种传染病的细菌和设计细菌战的方法。第二部（所谓实验部）从事第一部所得结果的实验。一个特别的“生产部”，所负任务是大量繁殖疾病细菌。有一部可笑地称为“训练教育部”，专门训练军事人员在战斗中使用细菌武器。
    所有这些日本细菌工厂的罪恶“工作”，是企图设计细菌战的方法，来确保可怕传染病的广大散播，和促成最大数目人命的死亡。关东细菌部队的整个所谓“科学”的活动，是从属于这个可恶的非人性的目标的。
    石井和他的走狗们特别注意最可怕和容易传播的传染病——鼠疫病菌。石井经过很长的“研究”后得出的结论是：散播鼠疫菌最有效的方法，不是直接的散播，而是通过跳蚤作媒介物。在预审中，关东军医务处长军医中将梶塚隆二证明：“石井还对我说……效力更大得多的细菌投掷法是不把细菌‘赤裸裸的’投掷下去，而是把它同媒介物一块，即同虫类，特别是同跳蚤一块投掷下去。跳蚤是最富有生命力的虫子，把跳蚤染上鼠疫后，就从飞机上投掷下去。而寄存在跳蚤体内的鼠疫菌，便能顺利地同跳蚤一起落到地面上。”（一○五页——中文版，下同）石井还周详地解决了用病菌传染食品问题，“石井向我叙述说，在这方面，用霍乱菌，赤痢菌，伤寒菌和副伤寒菌进行过实验。”梶塚隆二证明说：“当时是把菜蔬、水果，鱼类和肉类染上细菌。结果查出，对细菌战最适宜的是菜蔬，特别是叶子多的菜蔬，例如白菜；块根类由于表面平滑，较少适用，把细菌注射到水果一类的食品内去，要比把细菌染在外皮上的效力大些。据石井说，散布传染病最适当的媒介物是菜蔬，其次是水果，再其次是鱼类，最后是肉类……”（一○五页）这就是凶手石井及他在“第七三一部队”中的爪牙们所完成的残忍“研究”的结果。
    日本帝国主义并不以做实验研究为限，他们还培养跳蚤和细菌。“第七三一部队”拥有四千五百具孵育器，在三、四个月中可以生产四十五公斤的跳蚤。为了繁殖这样无数的跳蚤，就养了大批老鼠。该部队已有一万三千只老鼠，而石井计划着要增加到三百万只。细菌部队准备大量最可怕的细菌以便在战场上使用。单是“第七三一部队”的“生产部”，在一个生产周期内就能产出三万万亿微生物。日本细菌部队用天文数字来表示他们的生产能力，不用单位，或千，或亿而是用公斤来计算病菌数字，这是不足为奇的。数千公斤的霍乱菌或鼠疫菌——还有什么事比这更令人恶心的吗？即使一个疯人也不会疯狂到作出这样的事情来。然而，单是“第七三一部队”的“生产部”最高的工作能力，每月可能生产三百公斤鼠疫菌，六百公斤炭疽热菌，九百公斤伤寒菌和一吨霍乱菌！
    “生产部”器具中可怕的巨量细菌胶状体，不是单纯地贮藏在培养媒介的冷却器内，以等待行动的时间。在伯力城的审判中，不可争辩地证实了日本帝国主义在试验时，曾在活人身上广泛地使用这些细菌。
    证人田村正（前关东军司令部干部部长）招供了他在一九四五年六月视察“第七三一部队”的情形道：“石井将军和三个军官陪着我去视察过各实验室和生产场所……
    “在我视察生产场所时，他们把我引到内部一所房屋里去，这里有一些门上开着小窗的特式牢房，内中关得有被铁链系着的活人，据石井亲口向我解释，这些人是用来实验致命病菌的传染作用的。
    “在这些受实验的人中，我看见有中国人和欧洲人，还有一个女人……牢房中的人胡乱卧倒在地板上，形容极为痛苦难堪”。（一五九页——一六○页）
    对活人的残忍实验是在安达站附近特设的打靶场上进行的，被告川岛（恶名昭彰的前“第七三一部队”的生产部部长）描述这些实验情形如下：“在这种实验时用来进行实验的十五个人，从部队内部监狱运到之后，就被绑到实验场上栽入地里的柱子上……一架特备的飞机由平房站方面飞来了，飞机飞到打靶场上空时，投下了二十来枚炸弹，这些炸弹离地一百至二百公尺高的空中全都爆炸，于是装到炸弹内面的鼠疫跳蚤就落到了地面上，当时鼠疫跳蚤散满了整个打靶场（二六七页）。西俊英（同一部队的训练部部长）在审讯中证明：“我遵照第七三一部队长的命令，特于一九四五年一月间到安达站去过，我在那里亲眼看见进行传染坏疽症细菌实验的情形……当时用十名犯人来进行过这种实验。这些人都被绑到木柱上，面朝木柱，这些木柱彼此相隔五至十公尺不等。各犯人头部用铁帽盖起，躯体用铁板盖起。
    “除了臀部是光着之外，其余全身是盖着的。在约有一百公尺远的地方，用电流把一颗破片弹炸裂去实行传染。所有这十个人光着的部分都受了伤……并因染上坏疽症而死掉了。”（三○三页）
    “每年都有五六百人被送到第七三一部队里去。”川岛清供说：“……要是犯人受过致命病菌传染后又痊愈起来，那他也不免要受接二连三的实验，直到因传染病死去时为止……无论如何，从来都没有一个人能活着走出这个杀人工厂的。”
    “从一九四○年到一九四五年间，通过这个杀人工厂，因染致命细菌而被消灭的，至少有三千人。至于在一九四○年以前被消灭的人究竟有多少，那我却不知道……。”（一二○页——一二一页）
    日本刽子手们选择了牺牲者来作他们凶暴的实验，以适应他们自己的目的。日本宪兵队把被认为有反日心理的嫌疑、但缺乏证据不能提到法庭审判的人转交细菌部队的死牢。这些人包括俄国人和许多中国的爱国志士。“我们不知道大多数牺牲者的姓名，”国家公诉人斯米尔诺夫在审判中说，“因为凡属落到石井部队监狱里的人，立刻就失去了姓名。只给每个人一个号码，一直到他死去为止。当他受过实验后死去时，第一部的司书就把他的号码从名册上勾消，被毒死者的尸体便放到焚尸炉里去焚化，而从这死人身上解下来的镣铐就拿去给往下一个牺牲者带上。”（四六三页），石井部队的恶魔们叫这些不幸的牺牲者为“木头”（“logs”）。因此说明了他们是不当他们人看待的。
    日本细菌部队也在犯人身上进行其他罪恶的实验，尤其是残暴的冻伤实验，被告西俊英关于这个实验叙述如下：“……在严寒天气下，即在冷到零下二十度时，常把部队监狱里拘禁的人赶到外面去，然后把他们的手脱光，用人造冷风使手冻伤。随后就用小棍敲打冻伤的手，直到被敲打的手发出与木板声音相似的声音时为止。……关于这点也摄制有电影片。
    “影片上首先表明把四五个带脚镣的人赶到露天去，他们身穿棉衣，两手光着。随后就用一架巨大的扇风器用人工方法加速冰冻过程，然后又用小棍敲打冻僵的手，以便检查它们是否已经完全冰冻……”（三○二页）。这些对人类的残忍实验，惟有同纳粹德国秘密政治警察实验家的医师们在希特勒集中营所进行的实验才能相比。
    可是，无论如何，日本帝国主义者的惨无人道的罪恶并不止于此。在一九三九年至一九四五年，日本军队曾在几次战役中使用过石井部队所准备的细菌武器。
    这些企图的第一次是一九三九年，一个日本特别部队用烈性伤寒病菌传染哈勒欣河。一九四○年夏季“第七三一部队”从飞机上散播染有鼠疫的跳蚤于宁波地区（中国中部），结果该地发生了鼠疫流行症，由于石井命令，摄制了一部关于这些罪行的纪录影片，每当有高级军官来视察“第七三一部队”时都曾放映过。一九四一年夏季，鼠疫流行症发生在中国常德城一带，一九四二年，当日军在华中实行所谓“战略”退却时，他们广泛地用细菌毒染了蓄水池，田地和遗留在地区上的食品。一九四四年，第一○○部队对苏联实行细菌军事破坏活动，在苏联边界上的三河区各蓄水池内施放过毒菌。一九四五年在海拉尔地区，第一○○部队组织了一个远征队，其目的就是要对蒙古人民共和国进行细菌军事破坏。日本帝国主义者曾加紧准备反苏的细菌战，石井曾傲慢地自夸他的部队“能够用巨量的细菌去进袭苏联诸城市……”（一五九页）。
    同时，正如伯力城审判中所显示，日本侵略者曾准备对美国英国进行细菌战争。第七三一部队曾进行考查盎格鲁撒克逊人对于传染病的抵抗力；为此而实行检验美国战俘血液的性能（二七九页）。日本帝国主义计划在一九四五年开始他们的细菌攻势。日本侵略者希望借细菌武器之助，而使战争的趋势更有利于他们。
    日本帝国主义者的罪恶计划并没有成功。一九四五年八月间，苏军给予日本军队以神速的打击，并粉碎了关东军，在那里，石井和他的帮凶们正在行凶，因此也完全打破了他们的计谋。国家公诉人斯米尔诺夫在伯力城审判中说：“本来，拿出无数亿兆病菌之骇人力量来惨杀人类的时刻已是很迫近了的，而唯一因为苏联武装力量给了敌人一个歼灭、致命和神速的打击，才使世界免除了细菌战的惨祸”（五○四页）。前关东军总司令山田乙三在预审中供认：“我认为，假使当时苏联不曾出兵对日作战，那么细菌武器是会用去反对美国、英国及其他国家的。但由于苏联加入反日战争和苏军急速深入满洲腹地，遂使我们失去了使用细菌武器来反对苏联及其他国家的可能……”（一○三页）。
    这就是在伯力城审判中所发见的日本军阀的可恨罪行。在公开文件的简明语言中，阅读这本书使我们知道了这些罪恶，但是读它时，不可能没有震怒和愤慨，不可能没有痛恨这些可鄙罪犯们的感觉，他们企图使人类成为致命细菌的牺牲品。每个正直的人阅看了日本战争细菌学家的可怕罪恶“工作”的材料，将衷心地响应对这些犯罪的恶棍处以最严厉刑罚的要求，并将对苏联军队表示极大的感激，因为它斩断了伸在人类头上的刽子手的血手。
    但美国统治集团的反应则完全不同。这些集团知道了日本军事集团的罪恶以后，企图保护日本罪犯避免应处的惩罚。同时利用他们丑恶的活动的全部结果，在美国制造细菌武器。
    据报纸上的报道，在一九四六年初，美国已经获得日本细菌学家罪恶工作的材料，并已经开始用这些材料于新细菌武器的实验，这是美国科学家所强烈追求的。有几个日本和德国的细菌学家也参加这件工作。
    所以，当日本准备细菌战的问题发生在大部分日本战犯的东京审判时，美国代表们企图秘而不宣是不足惊奇的。当“第一六四四部队”（多摩部队）传染犯人的罪恶实验在一九四六年八月间在东京审判中宣读时，美国控告人宣称：“此刻我们不想拿出关于本问题的补充证据……”（二二六页）。此后苏方控告人把从日本战犯中得到的日本细菌部队工作的报告交给美国主要控告人肯南。无论如何，美国代表在军事法庭上不提出关于日本准备细菌战的任何补充文件。国家公诉人斯米尔诺夫关于这点在伯力城审判中观察称：“大概是有什么重要人物在力求妨碍揭破日本军阀骇人听闻的罪行”（四八○页）。
    苏联政府要求：这些主要罪行的重要组织者与鼓舞者：日皇裕仁，日军将领石井、北野、若松与笠原应交国际军事法庭审讯。美英政府在实际上拒绝支持苏联政府的要求，并包庇着残害人类的战犯。
    美国帝国主义不但不曾严重地惩罚日本战犯们，反而仿效着日本战犯，积极准备着细菌战。美国发展和制造细菌武器的基地——华盛顿附近的迪特瑞克营（Dettrick）的邪恶的名字已尽人皆知。当时美国国防部长詹森，供认关于发展细菌战方法的研究正在美国继续中。美国军队的化学部门每年在这可怕的工作上化费了一千二百万美元以上。
    本书的每个读者能够容易地明了这是什么意思。日本“第七三一部队”、“第一○○部队”和“第一六四四部队”不再存在着，安达站的杀人实验营是空着。但是这些部队的罪恶工作则正在美国加以研究。美国科学家冷酷地审查着被刽子手石井和他的帮凶所野蛮惨杀的成千无辜牺牲者痛苦的纪录。美国军事飞机正在习学如何在德意志民主共和国的领土上散播细菌和丢下来的方法——虽然不是鼠疫菌，而确实地只是马铃薯的害虫。
    伯力城审判这本书的伟大意义在于：在事实上揭露了日本帝国主义者的罪恶，它帮助读者清楚地了解今天美国战争煽动者和它的附庸国在秘密基地和最秘密的实验室中正在计划着和犯着反对人类的罪行。
    读了这本书以后，每一个正直的人，将更坚决地为巩固的最后的和平而斗争，以防止帝国主义侵略者发动战争，并且防止把死亡和破坏带给人类的恐怖势力的复活。（孔慧中译自一九五○年第六十三期苏联对外文化协会机关刊物ＶＯＫＳ）
