Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th: The West German people's movement against the remilitarization of West Germany and demanding the unification of all of Germany is becoming increasingly widespread and deeply rooted.

Among members of the West German Social Democratic Party, the sentiment demanding cooperation with the Communist Party and taking concerted action against remilitarization is growing day by day. Wiedacher, a cadre of the Social Democratic Party in Reichenhall, Bavaria, said: "The Communist Party's call for concerted action against remilitarization reflects the wishes of all working people." Cook, a member of the Gelsenkirchen branch of the Social Democratic Party, said: "I will be with Communist and Christian friends to set up thousands of round table meetings in the Rhine-Ruhr area to prepare for all-German negotiations." Manneck, a cadre of the Duisburg Social Democratic Party, said: "Chairman Schumacher's rejection of the proposal to unify Germany not only greatly violates the wishes of the majority of the German people, but also the wishes of the majority of Social Democratic Party members." Anton Krüger, a member of the Duisburg branch, and Stephen, a cadre of the Dortmund-Kamen Social Democratic Party, also expressed their support for Grotewohl's statement and the proposals of the People's Chamber.

Among young people of all strata in West Germany, the demand against remilitarization is also becoming increasingly strong. The Free German Youth League Council of Schleswig-Holstein, in the British occupation zone, called on the working people of the United States, Britain, and France to demand that their governments immediately stop remilitarizing West Germany and sign a peace treaty with a unified Germany. Members of the Anti-Militarization Council of the Reinickendorf Youth in West Berlin decided to launch a general assembly of all West Berlin peace advocates. The Dennauschingen Youth Conference passed a resolution stating: "German youth oppose remilitarization and military service because they hate war." The youth of the West German Center Party, under the chairmanship of Chairman Wessel, held a conference in Herten, protesting against West German remilitarization. The conference passed a resolution calling on the four foreign ministers to establish a unified and free Germany.

More than a thousand police officers in Hamburg also held a demonstration on the 15th, opposing the occupying authorities and the Bonn government's attempt to rebuild the Nazi Wehrmacht on the basis of the "police." Even Kirchner, the police representative of the right-wing trade union council, opposed the establishment of so-called "mobile police forces" in West Germany, saying that after the First World War, the so-called "mobile police" was the core of the Wehrmacht.

    社会民主党许多党员要求与共产党合作
    汉堡警察举行示威反对重建纳粹国防军
    【新华社二十日讯】柏林消息：西德人民反对西德重新军国主义化要求统一全德的运动已日趋广泛深入。
    在西德社会民主党党员中，要求与共产党合作，为反对重新军国主义化而采取一致行动的情绪一天比一天增长。巴伐利亚州莱亨哈尔地方的社会民主党干部威达契尔说：“共产党号召一致行动反对重新军国主义化反映了所有劳动人民的愿望。”社会民主党盖尔森基亨支部委员库克说：“我将与共产党和基督教的朋友们在一起，在莱因——鲁尔区域布置几千个圆桌会议以准备全德谈判。”杜伊斯堡社会民主党干部曼奈克说：“党的主席舒马赫拒绝统一德国的建议不仅大大地违反大多数德国人民的意愿，而且也违反了大多数社会民主党党员的意愿。”杜伊斯堡支部委员安东·克鲁格、多特蒙德——卡门社会民主党干部斯蒂芬等也都表示拥护格罗提渥的声明和人民议会的建议。
    在西德各阶层青年中，反对重新军国主义化的要求也日益强烈。英占区石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州自由德国青年联盟理事会号召美、英、法三国劳动人民要求他们的政府立即停止使西德重新军国主义化并和统一的德国签订和约。西柏林莱尼肯多夫青年反对军国主义化理事会的会员决定发起全部西柏林和平拥护者举行大会。登瑙斯清根镇青年大会通过决议称：“德国青年反对重新军国主义化和服兵役，因为他们憎恨战争。”西德中央党的青年们在该党主席威塞尔主持下在霍尔腾举行大会，抗议西德重新军国主义化。大会通过决议要求四国外长会议建立统一与自由的德国。
    汉堡的一千多名警察也在十五日举行了示威。反对占领当局与波恩政府企图在“警察”的基础上，重建纳粹国防军。连右翼工会理事会的警察代表克尔希纳也反对在西德成立所谓“机动警察部队”，他说，在第一次世界大战后，所谓“机动警察”就是国防军的核心。
