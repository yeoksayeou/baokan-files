(Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 19th) Now that the Huai River basin has thawed, the first spring project to fundamentally control the Huai River is about to fully commence. More than 400,000 laborers from Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces participating in the Huai River project have arrived at the construction sites one after another. This spring, the entire Huai River project will require approximately 1.5 million laborers. The project items mainly include building mountain valley reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Huai River and opening up depression areas for flood storage in the middle reaches. The secondary aims are to repair the main levees of the Huai River and dredge the main tributaries of the Huai River. Currently, the laborers who have arrived at the construction sites have already begun constructing the main river embankments and dredging the tributaries, and are about to begin constructing mountain valley reservoirs and depression flood storage projects.

In order to welcome this massive spring project, various places along the Huai River began planned construction preparations very early on. More than 800,000 laborers in the three special districts of Suxian, Fuyang, and Liu'an in northern Anhui Province have been organized and are successively heading to the construction sites, the vast majority of whom are fully capable laborers. The Huai River Management Committee has paid special attention to the preparation of labor rations. At the end of last December, the Finance Department of the committee sent more than 500 cadres to Shandong, Pingyuan, and other provinces to transport grain for the laborers. Under the leadership of this group of cadres, tens of thousands of farmers and workers have recently been transporting the labor rations day and night by both water and land routes to various construction sites along the Huai River. In areas lacking firewood, a large amount of coal has also been transported. The grain, grass, and coal at various construction sites along the Huai River are now piled up like mountains, sufficient to supply the needs of this spring's project. The work teams organized by the Political Department of the Huai River Management Committee have now arrived at the construction sites. In addition, work stations are planned to be set up at the construction sites along the Huai River, and staff for mobile bookstores and filming movies are also about to depart. The Central Anti-Epidemic Team, the Red Cross Society of China, and more than 1,000 Chinese and Western medical personnel in northern Anhui Province are now ready with equipment and medicines and are about to go to the construction sites to serve.

In addition, in terms of project preparation, the entire Huai River spring project plan has already been formulated, and thousands of cadres are still continuing to carry out surveys, measurements, and planning and design work for some of the projects. The Huai River Management Committee is stepping up the procurement of various equipment needed for the construction of mountain valley reservoirs and depression flood storage projects in various places, and some of them have already begun to be transported. The committee also plans to build houses, power plants, and light railways near the depression flood storage construction sites in the middle reaches, so that the project can proceed quickly and smoothly.

　　治淮春季工程将全面展开
    数十万民工已到达或正前往施工地点
    粮草煤炭堆积如山足供今春工程需要
    【新华社蚌埠十九日电】淮河流域现已解冻，根治淮河的第一个春季工程即将全面展开。河南、安徽、江苏三省参加治淮的民工已有四十多万人先后到达施工地点。今年春天，整个治淮工程约需要民工一百五十万人。工程项目，主要是在淮河上游修建山谷水库，在中游开辟洼地蓄洪；其次是培修淮河干河的大堤和疏浚淮河的主要支河。现在，到达工地的民工已经开始修建干河堤防和疏浚支河，并即将开始修建山谷水库和洼地蓄洪工程。
    为了迎接这个巨大规模的春季工程，沿淮河各地很早就开始了有计划的施工准备工作。皖北行政区的宿县、阜阳、六安等三个专区已有八十多万民工组织起来，正在陆续前往工地，其中绝大部分是全劳动力。治淮委员会特别注意工粮的准备工作。去年十二月底，该会财务部即派出五百多名干部前往山东、平原等省接运民工粮食。在这批干部的率领下，数以万计的农民和工人，最近正在将工粮由水、陆两路日夜兼程运到淮河沿岸的各个工地。在缺乏柴草的地区，大批的煤炭亦已运到。沿淮河各工地的粮、草和煤炭，现已堆积如山，足够供给今年春季工程的需要。治淮委员会政治部组织的工作队，现已到达工地。另外，拟在沿淮河工地上设立工作站，流动书店和拍摄电影的工作人员亦即将出发。中央防疫队、中国红十字会，和皖北行政区的一千多名中、西医医务人员，现在都已准备好了器材和药品，即将赴工地服务。
    此外，在工程准备方面，整个治淮的春季工程计划业已制定，数千干部现仍在继续进行部分工程的勘察、测量和规划设计等工作。治淮委员会正加紧在各地采购修建山谷水库和洼地蓄洪工程所需的各种器材，其中一部分已开始起运。该会并拟在中游洼地蓄洪工地附近修建房屋、发电厂和轻便铁路，使工程能够迅速而顺利地进行。
