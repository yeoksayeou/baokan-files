    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th] According to TASS, the European Workers' Congress against the remilitarization of Germany victoriously concluded on the 25th.

    The meeting on the 25th continued to discuss Koneczny's report. Representatives from countries including the Soviet Union, Britain, France, West Germany, Belgium, and Italy spoke.

    Soviet representative Osipov conveyed greetings from the Soviet working people to the congress, receiving enthusiastic cheers from all representatives. Osipov supported the proposal to establish a European Workers' Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany and to establish close cooperation among European workers.

    Representatives from Western European countries and West Germany reported on the experiences of their respective countries' working classes in the struggle for peace, unanimously expressing their support for establishing unified action by the working classes of all countries. British representative Hart said, "Without us workers from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium, the United States cannot wage war." This statement elicited enthusiastic cheers from the entire audience.

    After the discussion, the Credentials Committee of the Congress reported that a total of 894 delegates attended this congress, representing workers from various trade unions, parties, and non-party affiliated workers from all over Europe, including the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, East and West Berlin, France, Trieste, Spain, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, Britain, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. This fully demonstrated the breadth and strength of the movement against the remilitarization of Germany.

    After the congress adopted the report of the Credentials Committee, it adopted the telegram to the Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference, the Letter to the Working People of Europe, and the Congress Resolution with extremely high enthusiasm. All representatives also jointly issued a declaration expressing their support for the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace pact among the five major powers.

    The congress then elected the European Workers' Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany, including representatives from various European countries, and authorized the European Workers' Committee to write a letter to American workers on behalf of European workers.

    Before the closing of the congress, the West German delegation read a statement. In the statement, the 400 West German representatives pledged not to betray the expectations of workers throughout Europe and were determined not to allow West Germany to rearm. The statement called on the German working class to unite around the West German Central Committee Against Remilitarization, organize unified worker actions, fight against remilitarization and war, hold popular votes against the remilitarization of Germany in various places, expose war propagandists and expose all overt or covert war preparations, not allow the production or transportation of war materials in West Germany, drive Eisenhower and other American warmongers out of Germany, overthrow their accomplice, the Adenauer government, and launch a powerful struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany during this year's "May Day."

    The closing ceremony of the congress formed a powerful demonstration of defending peace, opposing the remilitarization of Germany, and expressing the friendship of the working classes of European countries.

    二十五日的会议继续讨论了康涅茨尼的报告。发言的有苏联、英国、法国、西德、比利时、意大利等各国的代表。
    苏联代表奥希波夫代表苏联劳动人民向大会致敬，受到全场代表热烈的欢呼。奥希波夫赞成成立欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会及建立欧洲工人的密切合作的建议。
    西欧各国和西德的代表报告了本国工人阶级争取和平的斗争中的经验，他们一致表示支持建立各国工人阶级的统一行动。英国代表哈特发言说：“如果没有我们英国、法国、意大利、德国和比利时的工人，美国便不能进行战争。”这句话引起全场热烈的欢呼。

    大会接着选出了包括欧洲各国代表在内的欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会，并授权欧洲工人委员会代表欧洲工人写信给美国工人。
    大会闭幕前，西德代表团宣读了一项声明。四百名西德代表在声明中保证不辜负全欧洲工人的期望，坚决不让西德重新武装。声明号召德国工人阶级团结在西德反对重新军国主义化中央委员会的周围，组织工人的统一行动，为反对重新军国主义化与战争而斗争，在各地举行反对德国重新军国主义化的人民投票，揭发战争宣传者和揭发一切公开的或隐蔽的战争准备，不允许在西德生产或运输战争物资，把艾森豪威尔和其他组织战争的美国人赶出德国去，打倒他们的共谋犯阿登纳政府，在今年的“五一”节发动反对西德重新军国主义化的强大斗争。
    大会的闭幕式形成了保卫和平反对德国重新军国主义化和表现欧洲各国工人阶级友好的强大示威。
