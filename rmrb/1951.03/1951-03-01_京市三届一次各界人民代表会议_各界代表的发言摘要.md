Excerpts from their speeches are as follows:

Lei Jieqiong, Representative of Democratic Parties:

All democratic parties in Beijing unanimously agree with the reports of Deputy Mayor Zhang, Deputy Director Cheng, and Deputy Director Feng, and unanimously and enthusiastically support the policy guidelines for Beijing this year proposed by Comrade Peng Zhen. This policy is very much in line with the demands of the citizens. We must cooperate with the government to continue to expand and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Because in 1951, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is an important task. We must assist the government to mobilize the masses so that every citizen consciously and automatically reports counter-revolutionary elements, so that these national scum have nowhere to hide and no loopholes to exploit. In strengthening urban-rural trade, we hope the government will pay attention to improving and developing transportation and increasing commercial loans. Our various parties must unite the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to take care of the interests of farmers. In terms of culture, education, and health, we hope that attention will be paid to the training of teachers, especially technical education teachers, and that private childcare centers will be encouraged. The issue of housing for citizens is a pressing issue that the city urgently needs to solve. We will assist the government through public-private partnerships to strive to achieve the plan to build 15,000 to 20,000 houses. All democratic parties in Beijing unanimously guarantee to strive to implement the 1951 work policy of Beijing.

Li Yonglu, Representative of Employees of State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises: Our group unanimously agrees with and supports the report of Chairman Peng Zhen on the work policy of the city for 1951. There are many matters related to the welfare of workers and citizens that we had not thought of, but Chairman Peng Zhen's report put forward very good opinions. We ask every representative to go back and convey this to everyone and ensure its implementation. We are also very satisfied with the government's work reports. More than 90 percent of the proposals passed by the People's Congress last year have been implemented or are being processed by the government. Unfinished matters, such as the housing problem, have also been listed as a key focus of this year's work plan. We unanimously thank Mayor Nie and all the staff of the government for their efforts. We resolutely support the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries promulgated by the Central People's Government and demand that the Municipal People's Government implement them earnestly. We will go back and call on everyone to assist the government in doing this. For those incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements who cannot be educated and reformed, we can only suppress them severely without being polite. Recently, the Central People's Government promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, which provide so much care for the welfare of us workers even before the revolutionary war has ended. Only under the people's regime led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can this be possible. We must further strengthen unity with the people of all strata, intensify support for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and thoroughly eliminate the aggression of American imperialism.

Li Guorui, Representative of Employees of State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises: I feel ashamed that everyone elected me as a member of the People's Government because I suffered all kinds of oppression in the old society, and my own ability is not enough, but on the one hand, I am very happy that the workers have participated in the government work. I myself am an example. This shows that the working class is leading the regime. Everyone voted for me, and I feel honored, but this honor belongs to the working comrades and all the people of Beijing, and it is also the honor of the working comrades of the whole country. In the future, I will faithfully serve as a servant of the people.

Wang Jingming, Representative of Farmers: Our farmer representatives unanimously support the work report of the Municipal People's Government. The government has done a lot for the farmers in the past year alone. The biggest thing is the completion of land reform, followed by work-relief to tide over the spring famine, loans, and the elimination of pests and diseases. The farmers understand that the People's Government is truly thinking of the people in every way. We are confident and sure that we can complete Comrade Peng Zhen's plan to increase agricultural production by 50% this year. Our methods are to organize, improve technology, improve varieties, apply more fertilizer, dig ditches to prevent waterlogging, dig canals and wells, and plant more cash crops. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not timely enough or is excessively lenient. Ma Shijun in Fengtai District and the Lu Huanzhong brothers in the northern suburbs are both local tyrants and secret agents with many crimes. The government has given them very light sentences, and the farmers demand the death penalty.

Wan Yaobin, Representative of Students: The student delegation fully agrees with the government's work report and unanimously supports the policy guidelines proposed by Comrade Peng Zhen. This policy is in line with the demands of the broad masses of the people and conforms to the interests of all the people. We must implement it with practical actions. In the future, we must, in accordance with the spirit of Comrade Peng Zhen's proposal, continue to expand and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, further strengthen the political and ideological education that combines patriotism and internationalism, oppose the U.S. imperialist rearmament of Japan, support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive to completely smash the aggression of U.S. imperialism. We must assist the government in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and carry out extensive publicity. We will never allow the existence and activities of counter-revolutionary elements in the capital of the people. Comrade Peng Zhen's report mentioned that attention should be paid to the health of students. We students are very grateful for Comrade Peng Zhen's concern. We remember that the food was initially improved last year, which was the result of the school's spare-time production under the direct call and leadership of Comrade Peng Zhen. This year, the conditions are even better, and we should redouble our efforts to carry out spare-time production, strengthen sports activities, exercise our bodies, study hard, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time, preparing to serve national defense construction and production construction.

Chen Yuan, Representative of Colleges and Universities: In the past year, our colleges and universities in Beijing have registered more than 230 hidden reactionary elements. Since U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, secret agents have attempted to revive. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the two things of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements and resisting America and aiding Korea in the future. If counter-revolutionary elements reveal their true colors, we can easily recognize them. If they pretend to be progressive and mix into our ranks, we are easily deceived. We must continue to deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and further eliminate the influence of imperialist cultural aggression.

Some teachers emphasize the importance of professional work and do not take care of students' political activities. Students are afraid of failing their courses and dare not actively participate in activities, which hinders the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. We must know that to engage in professional work away from resisting America and aiding Korea is to commit the same mistake as we did in the past of burying our heads in books and ignoring politics. Even if you do a good job in your professional work, it is equivalent to a person who has not undergone ideological transformation. We should not teach the next generation of young people to do this. We must know that the professional work combined with resisting America and aiding Korea is practical professional work. Professional work is our physique, and resisting America and aiding Korea is our spirit. We cannot have spirit without physique, nor can we have physique without spirit. Only by achieving both can we be considered successful.

The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement cannot stop until the Korean War ends. Under the banner of new patriotism and under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, we must closely combine professional work with resisting America and aiding Korea and engage in long-term struggle.

Xu Chubo, Representative of the Educational Trade Union: Last year, the work of the Municipal Government mostly exceeded the planned targets. Taking cultural construction alone, the number of middle school classes increased more than double the plan, and the number of primary school classes increased more than seven times. This proves that the work plan of our People's Government is not an empty check but is fulfilled in every way, and it is realistically and actively engaged in construction. Regarding the policy guidelines for this year, an educational worker originally prepared to put forward five proposals. After listening to Comrade Peng Zhen's report, it included four of his proposals. From this, we deeply feel that the opinions of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government are completely consistent with the opinions of the people. We educational workers are willing to work hard in three aspects to realize the policy proposed by Comrade Peng Zhen regarding cultural and educational work: (1) Through various courses and activities, we will continue to deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. At present, the focus is on opposing the U.S. imperialist rearmament of Japan. (2) Improving the quality of school education is mainly the responsibility of us educational workers. We must learn from the Soviet Union, give play to the leading role of teachers and the spirit of being fully responsible, and strive to study and create so as to train students to become excellent cadres for building a new China. (3) We must fully value the students' health.

Ding Yilan, Representative of Women: Chairman Peng Zhen's report reflects and solves the most pressing problems that the citizens need to solve, and we support it 100 percent. First of all, we agree to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries and further consolidate revolutionary order. A few days ago, the government executed fifty-eight extremely heinous secret agents, bandits, and ringleaders of reactionary secret societies, which was really popular with the people. We think the government did the right thing. In the future, those who should be killed should still be killed, those who should be imprisoned should be imprisoned, and those who should be managed should be managed. It is very necessary to think of the people and resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. In terms of spare-time education, adult literacy education, and health care work, we believe that the government should mobilize the strength of the people to cooperate and work together. Our women's organizations are willing to lead the women to actively participate in these works. In order to reduce the burden on female workers, we should find ways to do a good job in the childcare work of employees' children, establish nurseries, and implement work exchange assistance. We are willing to mobilize women throughout the city to assist the government in completing this year's work plan and strive to achieve the goal of saving money and doing more work.

Li Yizan, Representative of the Federation of Industry and Commerce: We believe that the work policy for this year proposed by Chairman Peng Zhen is realistic and in line with the interests of the people. To expand our democratic life, stabilize social order, and concentrate on economic construction, we must severely suppress the enemy. Otherwise, all the hard work we have put in will be destroyed by the enemy with a fire. In the past, the industrial and commercial sectors did not have enough understanding of the work of eliminating traitors and preventing special agents. Although some people hated special agents in their hearts, it was only abstract. Some people were paralyzed in their actions, and some only cared about sweeping the snow in front of their own doors and could not promptly report special agents and assist the government. Therefore, in the future, we must realize that if we do not root out the counter-revolutionary elements, the first to be harmed will be the industrial and commercial sectors. We must heighten our vigilance and resolutely eliminate the activities of special agents. Regarding the further reorganization of the economy, strengthening urban-rural trade, organizing commodity exchange, and orienting industry towards the countryside, this is the most correct policy in terms of finance and economics in the future, and it is also the most effective way to counter economic blockade and the path that the industrial and commercial sectors should take to develop their own businesses. Only by resolutely not relying on the imperialist economy and strengthening the exchange of industrial and agricultural products can we establish an independent and self-reliant new democratic economy and improve the people's lives. In the future, the industrial and commercial sectors should, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, organize private capital to participate in the work of commodity exchange so that industrial products can find a way out. Regarding the solution of the capital's housing shortage problem, the measures proposed by the government are effective. Only in this way can the working people have houses to live in and can coordinate with the capital's construction plan. Our industrial and commercial sectors are willing to respond to the government's call and put forward the slogan to the broad industrial and commercial sectors: guarantee a full supply of building materials, guarantee price stability, and make contributions to the people. In addition, we also suggest strengthening the crackdown on housing speculation and profiteering, limiting excessive rents, and strengthening house repairs.

Lian Kuoru, Representative of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles: Our group believes that the work policy of Beijing for this year proposed by Chairman Peng Zhen is truly in line with the needs of the people. Building 15,000 to 20,000 houses is the only way to solve the city's housing shortage. We suggest that suburban housing construction can be developed horizontally, but urban areas should be developed upwards, one layer at a time.

Deputy Director Feng of the Public Security Bureau reported on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements in the past two years, which made us very grateful to the government. However, we hope that this work will be strengthened. For example, there are still special agents and local tyrants lurking in our opera circle, secretly engaging in activities, and threatening the masses. Timid people dare not report them because they are afraid of retaliation and endure the pain without saying anything. This is terrible. They have become a scourge, destroying our unity, hindering our progress, and affecting the development of opera work. We hope that the government will help us thoroughly eliminate these local tyrants and special agents so that the artists who have been exploited and oppressed by them can truly stand up, and that the more than 3,000 artists in the Beijing opera circle can move towards great unity and take the work of improving opera a step further.

Yang Yisan, Representative of Ethnic Minorities: Comrade Peng Zhen proposed that the greatest task in 1951 is to continue to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. This movement has already achieved great results in the past, but it is not deep enough. Some people still cannot distinguish between friends and enemies, all because our propaganda is not enough. Some of our Muslim compatriots also have vague ideas, thinking that in the past when the reactionaries ruled, we had a share, and now we still have us, which is the glory of the Hui people. But they don't know that it is a big mistake to think like this. If we are with the reactionaries, it is our shame. In the future, we must strengthen the propaganda work so that the masses can clearly recognize who is the enemy and who is the friend. So that all ethnic groups can unite and follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao wholeheartedly forever. To complete this task, we must first strictly ban reactionary secret societies and severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements. For counter-revolutionary elements who are incorrigible, we must not be emotional, regardless of distance, "kin is not as close as father and son, near is not as close as husband and wife," but as long as they have reactionary behavior that damages the interests of the people and the country, we must severely punish them.

Juezan, Representative of Religious Circles: Regarding the elimination of imperialist influence and feudal remnants, our religious and ethnic minority representatives have expressed their firm support in group discussions. Christianity and Catholicism have been most deeply affected by imperialism. Now, a renovation movement is being carried out throughout the country to break away from imperialism. The government's crackdown on I-Kuan Tao's counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities is very correct, implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, and protected legitimate religions. In order to eliminate feudal influence, our Buddhist community published articles against secret society special agents in the recently published "Modern Buddhism" magazine. We must more deeply, widely, and precisely thoroughly eliminate the influence of residual feudal forces in the Buddhist community of the capital.

　　京市三届一次各界人民代表会议
    各界代表的发言摘要
    【京市新闻处讯】京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议于昨（二十八）日进行大会讨论时，发言的代表有：党派代表雷洁琼；公营工矿企业职工代表李永禄、彭则放、李国瑞；工会代表刘荣光、王春宜、徐楚波、郭景岩、崔澄海；农民代表刘万福、刘桐恩、王景铭、张继宗、杨茂；学生代表宛耀宾；专科以上学校代表罗常培、陈垣、邓可因；妇女代表丁一岚；工商联代表李贻赞；文联代表连阔如；医联代表李水；新闻界代表陈铭德；机关部队代表刘火；区域代表王伯超、钟履祥；少数民族与宗教界代表杨益三、巨赞、张汉民；合作社代表张清泰等三十人。发言摘要如下：
    党派代表雷洁琼：
    北京市各民主党派一致同意张副市长、程副主任与冯副局长的报告，并一致热烈拥护彭真同志所提出的北京市今年度的施政方针，这个方针是十分符合市民的要求。我们一定要配合政府继续扩大与深入抗美援朝运动。因为一九五一年度，抗美援朝运动是个重要任务。我们一定要协助政府，发动群众，使每个市民自觉自动检举反革命分子，使那些民族败类，无地容身，无孔可钻。在加强城乡贸易工作中，我们希望政府注意改善与发展交通，增加商业贷款。我们各党派一定团结本市工商界照顾农民利益。在文教卫生方面，希望注意师资的培养，尤其是技术教育师资的培养，并鼓励私人办托儿所。关于市民住房问题，是全市迫切要求解决的问题，我们将通过公私合力的办法协助政府，为实现建筑一万五千间到两万间房屋的计划而努力。我们北京市各民主党派一致保证，为贯彻北京市一九五一年度工作方针而努力奋斗。
    公营工矿企业职工代表李永禄：我们小组一致同意并拥护彭真主席关于本市一九五一年工作方针的报告。有很多关系工人和市民福利的事情，我们还没有想到，彭真主席的报告中都提出了很好的意见。我们要求每位代表回去后都好好传达给大家，保证执行。我们对政府的几项工作报告也很满意。去年各界人民代表会议所通过的提案，有百分之九十以上都已经政府执行或正在办理，没有办完的事，如房屋问题，也已列为今年工作计划的重点。我们一致感谢聂市长和政府全体工作人员的努力。我们坚决拥护中央人民政府颁布的惩治反革命条例，要求市人民政府切实执行，我们回去后要号召大家协助政府来做这件事。对于那些怙恶不悛无法教育改造的反革命分子，只有不客气地严厉镇压。最近中央人民政府颁布了劳动保险条例，在革命战争还没有结束以前，就对我们工人的福利有这么多的照顾。只有在毛主席、共产党领导的人民政权下，才能够这样。我们更要加强与各阶层人民的团结，加紧支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿援朝部队，彻底消灭美帝国主义的侵略。
    公营工矿企业职工代表李国瑞：大家选我当人民政府委员，感到惭愧，因为过去我在旧社会受尽压迫，本身能力不够，但一方面又很高兴，工人参加了政府工作，我自己就是个例子。这说明：工人阶级领导了政权。大家投票选举我，我自己感到光荣，但这光荣是属于北京市工人同志和全体人民的，也是全国工人同志的光荣。今后，我要忠实地做人民的勤务员。
    农民代表王景铭：我们农民代表一致拥护市人民政府的工作报告，政府去年一年单是给农民就办了很多事情，最大的是完成土地改革，其次是以工代赈度过春荒、贷款、消灭病虫害等，农民懂得了人民政府是真正处处为人民设想。彭真同志提出的今年农业生产比去年增产半成的计划，我们有信心有把握能够完成，我们的办法是组织起来、提高技术、改良品种、多施肥、挖沟防涝、开渠凿井、多种经济作物。对镇压反革命，还不够及时或是过分宽大。丰台区的马世俊、北郊的卢焕仲兄弟都是恶霸、特务，罪行很多，政府处刑很轻，农民要求处以死刑。
    学生代表宛耀宾：学生代表团完全同意政府的工作报告，一致拥护彭真同志所提出的施政方针，这个方针是合乎广大人民的要求，符合全体人民的利益的，我们一定要以实际行动来贯彻执行。今后我们一定本着彭真同志所提出的继续扩大与深入抗美援朝运动，进一步加强爱国主义和国际主义相结合的政治思想教育，反对美帝重新武装日本，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗。我们一定协助政府镇压反革命的工作，进行广泛宣传，我们决不允许人民首都有反革命分子存在和活动。彭真同志的报告中，提出要注意学生身体健康，我们学生对彭真同志的关怀非常感谢。我们想起去年伙食有了初步改善，那就是在彭真同志直接号召领导下进行学校课余生产的结果。今年条件更好，我们应加倍努力进行课余生产，加强体育活动，锻炼身体，努力学习，随时响应祖国的号召，准备为国防建设和生产建设而服务。
    专科以上学校代表陈垣：我们北京市专科以上学校，去年一年中登记暗藏的反动分子有二百三十多人。自美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来，特务分子就企图死灰复燃，所以我们今后对于镇压反革命分子和抗美援朝两件事应特别注意。反革命分子如果露出真面目来，我们容易认识，如果他假装进步，混进我们的队伍，我们就容易上当了。我们要继续深入开展抗美援朝运动，进一步肃清帝国主义文化侵略的影响。
    有些老师们强调业务重要，不照顾到同学的政治活动，同学怕功课不及格，不敢积极参加活动，就是阻碍了抗美援朝运动。我们要知道离开抗美援朝来搞业务，就是犯了我们从前埋头读书不问政治的毛病，让你业务搞得天好，也等于一个未经过思想改造的人。我们对下一代青年，不应该教他们这样做。我们要知道结合抗美援朝的业务，才是实用的业务。业务是我们的体质，抗美援朝是我们的精神。我们不能有精神而没有体质，也不能光有体质而没有精神。必须作到两者并存，才算成功。
    朝鲜战争一日不结束，我们抗美援朝运动一日不能停止。我们在新爱国主义的旗帜下，在毛泽东、中国共产党的领导下，我们必须使业务与抗美援朝紧密结合，进行长期的奋斗。
    教育工会代表徐楚波：去年市政府的工作大部都超过预订计划，单就文化建设说，去年增加中学的班次超过计划的一倍，小学班次超过七倍，这证明我们人民政府的工作计划不是空头支票而是样样兑现的，是实事求是积极从事建设的。对于本年度的施政方针，教育工作者有一位代表原来准备提五个提案，听了彭真同志的报告，里面包括了他的四个提案，从这里，我们深深感觉到中国共产党和人民政府的意见与人民的意见是完全一致的。我们教育工作者愿从三方面来努力实现彭真同志所提出关于文教工作的方针：（一）通过各种课程各种活动，继续深入推进抗美援朝爱国运动。在目前，以反对美帝重新武装日本为中心。（二）提高学校教育质量，主要责任在于我们教育工作者，我们一定学习苏联，发挥教师的主导作用及全面负责的精神，努力钻研创造，培养学生成为建设新中国的优秀干部。（三）必须充分重视学生的身体健康。
    妇女代表丁一岚：彭真主席的报告反映和解决了市民最迫切需要解决的问题，我们百分之百地拥护。首先，我们同意严厉镇压反革命，进一步巩固革命秩序。前些天，政府枪毙了五十八个罪大恶极的特务匪徒和反动会道门的首恶分子，真是人心大快，我们认为政府杀得对，以后，该杀的还得杀，该关的就关，该管的就管。为人民设想，坚决肃清反革命分子是十分必要的。在业余教育、成人识字教育和卫生保健工作方面，我们认为政府应该动员人民的力量共同协力进行，我们妇女团体愿意领导妇女群众积极参加这些工作。为了减轻女工的负担，我们应该想办法做好职工儿童的保育工作，建立乳儿室，实行拨工互助。我们愿意动员全市妇女协助政府完成今年的工作计划，努力做到既省钱，又多做事的目标。
    工商联代表李贻赞：彭真主席提出的今年的工作方针，我们认为是切合实际、符合人民利益的。要扩大我们的民主生活，安定社会秩序，安心进行经济建设，就非得对敌人加以严厉镇压不可。否则我们费了许多血汗，敌人一把火就给毁掉了。过去工商界对肃奸防特工作，认识不够，一部分人虽然心里恨特务，但只是抽象的，有的在行动上是麻痹的，有的只管各扫自己门前雪，不能及时检举特务协助政府。因此今后我们必须认识：如果不把反革命分子斩草除根，首先遭到危害的就是工商界，我们一定要提高警惕，坚决肃清特务活动。关于进一步改组经济，加强城乡贸易，组织商品交换，使工业面向农村的事，是今后财经方面最正确的方针，而且是反经济封锁最有效的办法，也是工商界发展自己业务应走的道路。惟有下决心不依赖帝国主义经济，加强工农产品的交流，才能建立起独立自主的新民主主义经济，才能使人民提高生活。今后工商界应在国营经济的领导下，组织私人资本，参加物资交换工作，使工业品找到出路。关于解决首都房荒问题，政府所提出的办法是有效的，只有这样，才能使劳动人民有房子住，才能配合首都建设计划。我们工商界愿响应政府这个号召，向广大工商界提出口号：保证建筑材料充分供应，保证价格稳定，向人民立功。另外我们还建议加强取缔房屋投机倒把行为，限制过高租金，加强修缮房屋。
    文联代表连阔如：我们小组认为彭真主席提出的北京市本年度施政方针是真正合乎人民需要的。建筑一万五千到两万间房屋是解决本市房荒的唯一办法。我们建议郊区房屋建筑可作横的发展，但城区应一层一层地往上发展。
    公安局冯副局长报告了两年来镇压反革命分子的工作，使我们对政府十分感激。但这一工作希望还要加强。如在我们戏曲界里面还有特务恶霸潜伏，暗中活动，威胁群众，胆小的人不敢举发，怕遭到报复，忍痛不言。这样就糟了，他们成了害群之马，破坏我们的团结，阻止我们进步，影响了戏曲工作的发展。希望政府帮助我们彻底肃清这些恶霸特务，使受他们剥削压迫的艺人能得到真正的翻身，使北京市戏曲界三千多艺人走向大团结，把戏曲改进工作提高一步。
    少数民族代表杨益三：彭真同志提出一九五一年最伟大的任务，就是继续普及与深入开展抗美援朝的运动。这一运动，过去已有很大的收获，但还不深入。有些人还分不清敌友，都是由于我们宣传不够的缘故。我们回民同胞中也有思想模糊的，认为过去反动派统治时代有我们份，现在也有我们，这是回族的光荣。殊不知这样想就大大地错了。我们如果和反动派在一起就是我们的耻辱。今后我们要加强宣传工作，使群众认识清楚谁是敌人，谁是朋友。使各民族团结一气，一心一意永远跟着共产党、毛主席走。要完成这个任务，我们首先就要严厉取缔反动会道门，严厉镇压反革命分子。对怙恶不改的反革命分子，我们就要不动感情，不分远近，“亲不如父子亲，近不如夫妇近”，但只要他们有反动行为，破坏人民和国家的利益，我们就要严厉制裁它。
    宗教界代表巨赞：对于肃清帝国主义影响和封建残余，我们宗教界和少数民族代表在小组讨论时都表示坚决拥护。基督教、天主教受帝国主义影响最深，现在正在全国各地开展革新运动，与帝国主义割断关系。一贯道进行反革命阴谋活动，政府加以取缔是非常正确的，贯彻了宗教信仰自由政策，保护了正当宗教。我们佛教界为了肃清封建影响，在最近出版的《现代佛学》刊物上发表了反对会道门特务的文章，我们一定更深入、广泛、精密地在首都佛教界中彻底肃清残余封建势力的影响。
