　　National Newspaper and Periodical Distribution Work Conference Determined to
    Implement "Unified Postal Distribution" and Strengthen Distribution Forces
    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government convened a Newspaper and Periodical Distribution Work Conference from February 15th to 28th. The conference summarized the experience of the "Unified Postal Distribution" in 1950, discussed and adopted the guidelines, plans and distribution methods for newspaper and periodical distribution in 1951. Focusing on how to do a good job in "Unified Postal Distribution," increase the number of distributions, and improve the quality of distribution work, the conference focused on studying how to strengthen the distribution forces. The conference believes that the "Unified Postal Distribution" policy is correct and must be adhered to. At present, the fundamental problem with the post office in terms of distribution is that the national public and private distribution forces are very insufficient. Therefore, in the report of Minister Zhu Xuefan of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, he emphasized the issue of organizing distribution forces outside the post office. After discussing Minister Zhu Xuefan's report, the conference believed that to organize mass distribution, it is necessary to organize a distribution network, with the postal network as the backbone, to unite and encourage all usable forces in society to unite around the postal network, making it a broader and deeper distribution network. In cities, the existing private distribution forces, the cooperative distribution forces that are budding, and other individual distribution forces should be valued. In addition, mass distribution should be organized, mainly through the messengers and receivers in organs, schools, and factories and mines, to establish regular and fixed distribution organizations. The conference believes that organizing the rural distribution network is an important part of the current distribution work. After the land reform, the cultural demands of the vast number of peasants are becoming increasingly urgent, and while the People's Post Office is still unable to universally establish rural postal services, it is necessary to better organize the mass forces in rural areas. Some places rely on district, township, and village governments, central primary schools, and cooperatives to carry out newspaper distribution, while Songjiang Province in Northeast China uses mass cooperation methods to hire full-time personnel to be responsible for distribution work. Shangzhi County in Songjiang Province used this method to form a rural communication network, reducing the burden on farmers in terms of communication work and solving the urgent need for rural communication among the masses. This experience is worth promoting in various places. Finally, the conference adopted the 1951 distribution plan, with newspaper distribution increasing by 1.2 million copies compared with 1950, and periodical distribution increasing by more than 700,000 copies. The representatives from various places attending the meeting expressed their determination to resolutely implement the guidelines, plans, and methods adopted by the meeting, so that the work of "Unified Postal Distribution" can be further developed.

　　全国报刊发行工作会议确定
    贯彻“邮发合一”壮大发行力量
    【本报讯】中央人民政府邮电部二月十五日至二十八日召开了邮电部报刊发行工作会议。会议总结了一九五○年“邮发合一”的经验，讨论并通过了一九五一年的报刊发行方针、计划和发行办法。围绕着如何把“邮发合一”工作做好，增加发行数量、改进发行工作的质量，会议着重研讨了如何壮大发行力量问题。会议认为“邮发合一”的方针是正确的，必须坚持下去。目前邮局在发行方面的根本问题，是全国公私发行力量均甚不足。因此，中央人民政府邮电部朱学范部长的报告中，就着重强调组织邮局以外的发行力量问题。大会在讨论了朱学范部长报告之后，认为组织群众发行，必须组织发行网，以邮政网为骨干，团结和鼓励社会上一切可以使用的力量团结在邮政网的周围，使成为一个更广泛更深入的发行网。在城市中，现有的私营发行力量，正在萌芽中的合作社性质发行力量，以及其他个体发行力量，均应加以重视之外，并应组织群众发行，主要的是要通过机关、学校、工矿里的传达收发人员，建立经常固定的发行组织。大会讨论中，认为组织乡村发行网，是目前发行工作中重要的一环。土地改革后，在广大农民对文化上的要求日益迫切，而人民邮局还无力普遍建立乡村邮政的条件下，则必须更好地组织农村中的群众力量。有些地方依靠区、乡、村政权、中心小学、合作社来开展报纸发行问题，而东北松江省则用群众合作方法，雇用专人负责发行工作。松江省尚志县用这个方法，组成了农村通讯网，减少了农民原来对于通讯工作上的负担，而又解决了群众急需的乡村通讯问题。这一经验，值得各地推广。最后，大会通过了一九五一年发行计划，报纸发行比一九五○年增加一百二十万份，期刊增加七十多万份。到会各地代表对会议所通过的方针、计划和办法，均表示要坚决贯彻，使“邮发合一”的工作，得到进一步的发展。
