　　The Victory of the New China's People's Film Industry
　　Lin Danqiu
　　Starting from the 8th of this month, sixty cinemas in twenty cities across the country will consecutively screen twenty-six new films produced by state-owned studios. This is a concentrated exhibition of the majority of productions from the three state-owned film studios in Northeast China, Beijing, and Shanghai in 1950, allowing audiences to review the victorious achievements of the New China's people's film industry over the past year through this exhibition.
　　People's cinema is the most mass-oriented art form. It reflects the lives and struggles of the masses and, in turn, educates them and raises their political, ideological, and cultural levels. Lenin said, "Of all the arts, for us, the most important is cinema." Stalin said, "Cinema is the greatest tool for large-scale propaganda and agitation." Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his reply to the comrades translating films at the three state-owned film studios on February 28th of this year, said, "The young Chinese people's cinema has become an extremely important department in the New China's cultural undertaking." These words clearly illustrate the significance and role of cinematic art for the masses and their revolutionary struggles and construction endeavors, and also demonstrate the immense responsibility of the people's film workers! It is of great significance that we now centrally review the film achievements of the past year.
　　Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy is the guiding principle for the development of all our literature and art, including cinema, and is the basic line for the victorious advance of our film industry over the past year. Guided by this policy, our film industry has made great achievements in a short period of one year. The state-owned film studios' productions in 1950 not only fulfilled the production plan in terms of quantity but also made significant progress in quality. These productions reflected the lives and struggles of the masses and the construction work in various aspects of the New China, and were warmly welcomed by the broad audience, laying the foundation for the people's film industry. These productions, whether feature films or documentaries, all possess a certain ideological and artistic quality and the power to inspire the masses to move forward. Our feature film "Daughters of China," documentaries "Embarking on the Road to Life," "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze," "Triumphant Songs of the Great Southwest," "Three Years of Liberation War in Northeast China," "Red Flag Sweeps the Northwest," and the lead actress in the feature film "Zhao Yiman" won awards in the Fifth International Film Competition. This is an honor for the New China's film industry and the people of the whole country.
　　The continuous production of state-owned films and progressive films from private studios, coupled with the large-scale import of Soviet translated films, has brought about a fundamental change in the national film market: progressive films, which were always at an absolute disadvantage in old China, have now gained the upper hand, and harmful American films that once dominated in quantity and instilled various ideological poisons into the audience have now been basically eliminated nationwide. This is a landmark event in the history of Chinese cinema.
　　The reason why state-owned films have achieved their current success is primarily because they have adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy in film creation. The vivid images of workers, peasants, and soldiers and their earth-shattering heroic deeds have become the main content of new films. This is a great revolution in Chinese film art, giving our films a solid texture, abundant vitality, and a strong appeal, making them a powerful tool for educating the masses. This is the basic prerequisite for the healthy growth of people's cinema. On the film front, we have many experienced and excellent directors and actors, and a large number of new and promising directors and actors have emerged, and they have achieved close cooperation and mutual learning in their work. At the same time, various practical departments have provided great assistance in film production, making the reflection of reality in films more authentic and complete. Without this kind of cooperation and assistance, it would not have been possible to achieve the results we have today.
　　Our cinematic art must be systematically popularized to the worker, peasant, and soldier masses and gradually widely penetrated into factories, troops, and rural areas. The screening work and screening preparation work of the past year have achieved preliminary results and experience. Six hundred screening teams have been established nationwide, and more than 1,800 projectionists were trained last year. However, this is still far from meeting the actual needs. China is so large and has so many people, especially the vast number of peasants who have never had the opportunity to see movies, who urgently demand that movies go to the countryside. The serious situation of supply falling short of demand has already occurred, which is clear evidence that the New China's film industry has unlimited prospects for development. The relevant leading organs and the film industry must systematically carry out manpower and material preparations on a large scale to gradually solve this problem.
　　It is necessary to continue to improve the quality of our films. In order to "improve our cinematic art year by year and month by month," film criticism is an indispensable weapon. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "One of the main methods of struggle in the literary and art circles is literary and art criticism." Film criticism is an important department of the entire literary and art criticism. Its task is not only to help the audience correctly understand the content of the film and its educational significance but also to help film work improve a step from its existing foundation. Film criticism should point out the advantages and disadvantages of the film in a realistic manner and provide specific analysis. For the past year, our film review work has been really poor. There are too few people writing film reviews, and even fewer good film reviews. Some film reviews are merely summaries of the film's story, while others are general "impressions after watching," and they rarely specifically touch on the ideological and artistic level of the film, and they are not of much help to the authors and the audience. This situation must be changed quickly.
　　The New China's film industry is still in a very young stage. The gains of the past year are only the initial results of practicing Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy. The existing achievements must be valued. The shortcomings can be overcome. The prospects for development are unlimited because our Party and the People's Government need it, and the people of the whole country need it. Our film industry has already won a great victory, and we must consolidate and expand this victory.

### 新中国人民电影事业的胜利

　　新中国人民电影事业的胜利
    林淡秋
    全国二十个城市六十个电影院从本月八日起将接连放映二十六部国营新片。这是东北、北京、上海三个国营电影制片厂一九五○年大部分出品的集中展览，让观众通过这个展览来检阅新中国人民电影事业一年来的胜利果实。
    人民的电影是最富有群众性的艺术，是反映群众的生活和斗争，又回过来教育群众，提高群众的政治、思想、文化水平的最有力的工具。列宁说过：“在一切艺术中，对我们最重要的是电影。”斯大林说过：“电影是大规模宣传鼓动的最伟大的工具”。刘少奇同志在本年二月二十八日给三个国营制片厂翻译片同志们的复信中说：“年青的中国人民电影，在新中国文化事业上，已成为一个极其重要的部门。”这些话都清楚地说明了电影艺术对人民大众及其革命斗争和建设事业的意义和作用，也说明了人民电影工作者的任务是何等重大！现在我们来集中检阅一年来的电影成绩，是有极大意义的。
    毛泽东同志的文艺方针，是发展我们的全部文学艺术包括电影在内的指导原则，是我们的电影界一年来胜利进军的基本路线。由于这一方针的指导，我们的电影事业在短短的一年内做出了很大的成绩。国营制片厂一九五○年的出品，非但在数量上完成生产计划，而且在质量上也有显著的进步。这些出品反映了人民大众的生活和斗争，反映了新中国各方面的建设工作，受到广大观众的热烈欢迎，打下了人民电影事业的基础。这些出品，不论故事片或纪录片，都具有一定的思想性和艺术性与鼓舞群众前进的力量。我们的故事片《中华女儿》、纪录片《踏上生路》、《百万雄师下江南》、《大西南凯歌》、《东北三年解放战争》、《红旗漫卷西风》等以及故事片《赵一曼》的主演者，在第五届国际影片竞赛中获得优胜奖。这是新中国电影界和全国人民的光荣。
    国营影片和私营制片厂进步影片的源源出产，再加上苏联翻译片的大量输入，就使得全国电影市场起了根本的变化：在旧中国一向处于绝对劣势的进步片现在取得了优势，曾在数量上占压倒优势的、向观众灌输各种思想毒素的美国有害影片，现在在全国范围内基本上肃清了。这是我国电影史上划时代的一件大事。
    国营影片所以获得现有的成就，首先是因为在电影创造上坚持了毛泽东同志的文艺方针。有血有肉的工农兵形象及其翻天覆地的英雄事迹已成为新影片的主要内容。这是中国电影艺术上的大革命，使得我们的影片具有坚实的质地、充沛的生命力和强烈的感动力，成为教育人民大众的有力工具。这是人民电影获得健康成长的基本前提。在电影战线上，我们有许多有经验的优秀的导演和演员，而且已产生了大批新的有希望的导演与演员，他们在工作上做到了密切合作互相学习。同时，各实际工作部门在影片制作上给了大力的协助，使电影反映现实更加真实和完满。没有这种合作和协助，就不可能取得象今天的成绩。
    我们的电影艺术必须有计划地更进一步向工农兵大众普及，逐步广泛深入到工厂、部队、农村里去。过去一年的放映工作和放映准备工作取得了初步的成绩和经验，已在全国建立了六百个放映队，去年集中训练了一千八百余名放映员。但是这离实际的需要还远得很。中国那么大，人口那么多，尤其是一向没有看电影机会的广大农民，迫切要求电影下乡。供不应求的严重情况已经发生了，这是新中国电影事业有无限发展前途的明证。有关领导机关和电影界必须有计划地大力进行人力物力的准备，逐步解决这个问题。
    继续提高我们的影片的质量是必要的。为了“逐年逐月地提高”我们的电影艺术，电影批评是一件不可缺少的武器。毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中说：“文艺界的主要斗争方法之一，就是文艺批评。”电影批评是整个文艺批评的一个重要部门，它的任务不但要帮助观众正确理解影片的内容及其教育意义，而且要帮助电影工作从现有的基础上提高一步。电影批评应该实事求是地指出影片的优点和缺点，加以具体的分析。一年以来，我们的影评工作实在做得太差了。写影评的人太少，好的影评更少。有些影评仅仅是电影故事的摘要，有些则是泛泛的“观后感”，都很少具体接触到影片的思想水平和艺术水平，对于作者和观众的帮助都不大。这种情况必须迅速加以改变。
    新中国的电影事业，正处在非常年青的阶段，一年来的收获仅仅是实践毛泽东同志的文艺方针的初步成果。现有的成绩必须加以重视。缺点是可以克服的。发展前途是无限量的，因为我们的党和人民政府需要它，全国人民需要它。我们的电影界已经获得了巨大的胜利，我们必须巩固和扩大这胜利。
