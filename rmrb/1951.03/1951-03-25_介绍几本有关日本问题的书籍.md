American imperialism is striving to rearm Japan, conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, revive Japanese imperialist aggressive forces, make it a force to undermine peace in the East, and become a tool of American aggressors. Now, the Japanese people, together with the people of the world and the Chinese people, are fighting against the US imperialist conspiracy and for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The following books can help us understand the situation of this struggle and its possible consequences.

	*The Japanese People and the Japanese Communist Party in Hard Struggle*
	Edited by Xinhua Current Affairs Series Editorial Department, published by Xinhua Bookstore
	This book is a compilation of the most important documents on the Japanese question at present. These documents point out the current situation and future of the Japanese people's struggle, as well as the strategy and tactics of the Japanese Communist Party.
	One of the characteristics of the current world situation is that American militarists are concentrating their main attention on Japan in the East, attempting to make Japan a major base for military adventures against the Soviet Union, against People's China, and against the people's democratic movements in Asian countries. The situation in postwar Japan has been, and is now even more so, that American imperialism creates and supports all reactionary policies in Japan. In order to obtain genuine democracy in Japan and lasting peace in Asia, the Japanese Communists should not only oppose the reactionary forces in Japan, but also expose the conspiracy of US imperialism to colonize Japan, and expose the danger of making Japan a base for anti-people wars. The struggle for democracy in Japan must be linked to the struggle against the separate conclusion of a separate peace treaty that sacrifices the interests of the Japanese people and the demand for the withdrawal of US occupation forces. However, the Japanese Communists did not initially correctly recognize this, and therefore could not guide the Japanese people's struggle in the right direction.
	The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, *For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy*, correctly criticized this principled error of the Japanese Communist Party. This newspaper also published an important editorial, "The Road to the Liberation of the Japanese People," sincerely and earnestly pointing out that although the situation of the Japanese people and Communists is very serious, they must not abandon the fundamental position of correctly uniting and educating the people to engage in serious revolutionary struggle for the sake of tactical flexibility.
	With the enthusiastic and firm help of international fraternal parties, the Japanese Communists demonstrated its noble qualities, quickly corrected its mistakes, re-established the correct policy of leading the Japanese people to victory, and conducted a pragmatic intra-party struggle to maintain the party's life – unity and unification.
	This booklet mainly contains many documents related to this issue. However, it should be pointed out that there are still some flaws in the editing method of this book. It combines an important editorial written by this newspaper for the unity of the Japanese Communist Party, "The Current Situation of the Japanese People's Struggle," and general essays and communications from other newspapers and periodicals into the first series, and compiles many documents related to the above-mentioned struggle into the second and third series, and does not take into account the continuity of time. This makes the arrangement appear disorganized and unable to enable readers to correctly understand the importance of this event and its development process.

	*Japan Under US Imperialist Occupation Is a Seedbed of Fascism*
	Edited by Xinhua Current Affairs Series Editorial Department, published by Xinhua Bookstore
	This book focuses on exposing that Japanese militarism, under the shelter and cultivation of the US MacArthur Headquarters, has revived and become a tool for US imperialism to invade the Far East and suppress the Asian national liberation movement. Within Japan, armed police are being trained in large numbers. The Japanese army has long been rebuilt under the guise of the police, and the Japanese navy has been rebuilt by strengthening the Maritime Safety Agency. Large-scale Japanese firefighters and Japanese unemployed military officers and special agents who are in collusion with American intelligence agencies have been organized. These reactionary armed groups are organized by US imperialism to suppress and hunt down democratic movements and progressive leaders, and as accomplices in invading Korea, China, attacking the Soviet Union, and attacking the national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries.
	US imperialism is actively encouraging Japan to restore its war industry, revive the financial cliques, and strive to develop gunpowder and steel production. American capital controls Japan's railways, telecommunications, and electricity industries, strangling Japan's peace industry, and increasing the exploitation of the Japanese people, attempting to turn Japan into a colony. At the same time, US imperialism never relaxes its efforts to build naval and air force bases everywhere from Hokkaido to southern Kyushu.
	US imperialism's illegal acts in Japan have immediately been resisted by the Japanese people and have also aroused the anger of the people all over the world. In the thesis of Japanese Communist leader Tokuda Kyuichi, the situation of Japan's militarization and colonization under American occupation is vividly explained, and the combat determination of the vanguard of the Japanese patriotic people, the Japanese Communist Party, is powerfully expressed. They shoulder great combat tasks, and their struggle will surely achieve victory.

	*How US Imperialism Supports Japan*
	Written by Zhai Yiwo, published by People's Publishing House
	This book clearly exposes the policy of US imperialism in actively supporting Japanese militarist aggressive forces in Japan for more than five years, and exposes the specific crimes of US imperialism in Japan, how US imperialism is supporting Japanese militarism, with actual examples and specific statistics.
	US imperialism is using war criminals who invaded China to lead the "police reserve force," sending war criminals who invaded China to Taiwan to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang make military arrangements to obstruct our army from liberating Taiwan, openly using fascist soldiers to participate in the war of aggression against Korea, and even more brazenly violating the Potsdam Proclamation, lifting the purge of heinous militarist war criminals. In a word, US imperialism is frantically condoning and supporting the revival of Japanese fascist aggressive forces.
	This conspiracy of US imperialism is sinister, and the Chinese people and Asian people who have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression will never tolerate this. However, people see that this also shows how weak the imperialist camp is! No matter how much US imperialism flaunts its power, its strength is bet on the resurgence of Japanese military aggressive forces, which is still unknown.

	*The Japanese People Struggle to Smash the Shackles of Slavery*
	Written by Deng Chao, published by World Knowledge Press
	This book narrates many important issues of the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japanese reactionaries from 1946 to 1950, and it is a relatively systematic reading material. The first chapter discusses the peace treaty issue; the second chapter exposes the US imperialist's frantic arms expansion in Japan; the third chapter analyzes the conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries to suppress the Japanese democratic movement, persecute the Japanese people, and attempt to turn Japan into a colony; the fourth chapter focuses on introducing the heroic struggle of the Japanese people of all strata; the fifth chapter narrates the correct policy established by the Japanese Communist Party to guide the Japanese people to liberation with the assistance of international fraternal parties. There is no doubt that under the firm and correct leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese people will inevitably move towards victory step by step. The maturity of the party is the main symbol of the maturity of the revolution, which has been fully confirmed by all revolutionary history; the sixth chapter narrates the fraternal friendship between the Chinese people and the Japanese people.
	This book also has some shortcomings. It describes very little the close connection between the Japanese people's struggle and the world people's struggle, and it does not give due solemn indication to the inevitable victory of the Japanese people's struggle in the growing and victorious world people's struggle for peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union, which should be a very important shortcoming. In addition, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of the broad Japanese people's united front against the US-Japanese reactionaries.

	*Oppose the United States Rearming Japan*
	Edited by Tianjin Propaganda Handbook Society, published by Knowledge Bookstore
	The contents of this book include Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the Japanese peace treaty issue, two editorials in this newspaper on opposing the US imperialist's conspiracy to separately conclude a peace treaty and arm Japan, the exchange of documents between the Soviet Union and the United States on the Japanese peace treaty issue, and the documents of China and the Soviet Union protesting against the US imperialist's unauthorized interpretation of Japanese war criminals. Finally, the book is attached with the Declaration of Twenty-Six Nations in 1942, the Cairo Conference Declaration in 1943, the Potsdam Proclamation (excerpt) in 1945, and the Basic Policy for Japan of the Far Eastern Commission in 1947. This is a fairly complete booklet.

　　介绍几本有关日本问题的书籍
    美帝国主义正在力图重新武装日本，单独对日媾和，复活日本帝国主义侵略势力，使它重新成为破坏东方和平的力量，成为美国侵略主义者的工具。现在，日本人民与世界人民、中国人民一道，正为着反对美帝阴谋，争取全面对日和约而斗争。下面的一些书可以帮助我们了解这一斗争的情况及其可能的结果。
    《艰苦斗争中的日本人民与日本共产党》
     新华时事丛刊社编  新华书店出版
    本书是目前有关日本问题的最重要的文献的编集。这些文献指明了日本人民斗争的现势、前途以及日本共产党的战略和策略。
    目前世界局势的特点之一，是美国军国主义者在东方集中主要注意力于日本，企图使日本成为反对苏联、反对人民中国及亚洲各国人民民主运动的军事冒险主要基地。战后日本的形势，一直是，现在更加是：美国帝国主义制造和支持着日本一切反动政策。为获得日本真正的民主、亚洲的永久的和平，日本共产党人就不应该止于反对日本本国的反动派，而且要揭露美帝国主义殖民地化日本的阴谋，揭露使日本成为反人民战争基地的危险。争取日本的民主的斗争，必须与反对单独缔结牺牲日本人民利益的单独和约与要求撤退美国占领军的斗争联系起来，但日本共产党人起初没有正确认识这一点，因而不能把日本人民的斗争导向于正确的方向。
    共产党与工人党情报局机关报《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》正确地批评了日本共产党这一原则错误，本报亦曾发表重要社论《日本人民解放的道路》，忠诚恳切地提出虽然日本人民和共产党人的处境十分严重，但决不能为了策略上的灵活而放弃了正确地团结和教育人民从事严重的革命斗争的根本立场。
    在国际兄弟党这种热情坚定的帮助下，日本共产党人显示了它的高贵的品质，迅速纠正了它的错误，重新建立了领导日本人民走向胜利的正确的政策，并为此进行了实事求是的党内斗争，保持了党的生命——团结和统一。
    这一小册子，主要就是有关这一问题的许多文件。但应该指出来，本书在编辑方法上还存在着一些毛病，它把本报为日本共产党的统一而写的一篇重要社论《日本人民斗争的现势》和其他报刊中的一般论文通讯合编成第一辑，而把有关上述斗争的许多文件编成第二辑和第三辑，并且也没有照顾到时间的连续性，这样在编排上就显得零乱，不能使读者正确了解这一事件的重要性和它的发展过程。
            《美帝占领下的日本是法西斯主义的苗床》
            新华时事丛刊社编  新华书店出版
    这本书集中揭露了日本军国主义在美国麦克阿瑟总部的卵翼培养下，已经复活起来，变成美帝国主义侵略远东和镇压亚洲民族解放运动的工具。在日本国内，武装警察在大量训练着。日本的陆军早已在警察名义的伪装下重建起来，又用加强海上保安队的办法来重建日本的海军。组织了大规模的日本消防队员和与美国情报机关有勾结的日本失业军官和特务。这些反动的武装集团，都是美帝国主义为了镇压搜捕民主运动和进步领袖，并作为侵略朝鲜、中国、进攻苏联以及袭击东南亚各国民族解放运动的帮凶而组织的。
    美帝国主义积极鼓励日本恢复战争工业，复活财阀势力，努力发展火药、钢铁生产。美国资本控制日本的铁道、电讯和电力工业，绞死日本的和平工业，加重了对日本人民的剥削，企图变日本为殖民地。同时美帝国主义一刻也不放松在北海道到九洲南部的地方，到处修筑海空军基地。
    美帝国主义在日本的不法行为，立即遭到了日本人民的反抗，也激起了全世界人民的愤怒。在日共领袖德田球一的论文里，生动地说明了日本在美国占领下，军事基地化和殖民地化的情况，并且有力地表示了日本爱国人民的前卫——日本共产党的战斗决心，他们肩负着伟大的战斗任务，他们的斗争一定要取得胜利。
            《美帝怎样扶日》
            翟一我编著  人民出版社出版
    本书明确地揭穿了美帝国主义在日本五年多来所积极实行的扶植日本军国主义侵略势力的政策，把美帝国主义在日本的具体的罪行，美帝国主义到底在怎样扶植日本军国主义，用实际的例子和具体的统计数字揭发了出来。
    美帝国主义起用侵华战犯领导“警察后备队”，派侵华战犯去台湾帮助蒋介石匪帮作阻挠我军解放台湾的军事布置，公开起用法西斯军人参加侵朝战争，更悍然违反波茨坦公告，解除对罪恶滔天的军国主义战犯的整肃，一句话，美帝国主义正在疯狂地纵容和扶植日本法西斯侵略势力的复活。
    美帝国主义这一阴谋是凶恶的，曾经身受日本帝国主义侵略的中国人民和亚洲人民，对此绝不能容忍。然而人们看到，这也表明了帝国主义阵营是多么的软弱！不论美帝国主义如何张牙舞爪，它的力量却押在还是未可知的日本军事侵略力量重起的这一宝上。
            《日本人民为粉碎奴隶的枷锁而斗争》
            邓超著  世界知识社出版
    本书叙述了一九四六——一九五○年日本人民为反对美日反动派而斗争的许多重要问题，这是一本比较系统的读物。第一章论述和约问题；第二章揭露美帝在日本的疯狂备战；第三章分析美日反动派镇压日本民主运动，迫害日本人民，企图沦日本为殖民地的阴谋；第四章着重介绍了日本各阶层人民英勇斗争的情况；第五章叙述在国际兄弟党协助之下，日本共产党建立的引导日本人民走向解放的正确政策，毫无疑问，在日本共产党坚定而正确的领导之下，日本人民必然要一步步走向胜利，党的成熟乃是革命成熟的主要标志，这是一切革命历史都充分证实了的；第六章叙述中国人民和日本人民的兄弟的友谊。
    本书也有一些缺点。它对于日本人民斗争和世界人民斗争的密切关联性，叙述得很少，对于在日渐壮大、胜利的以苏联为首的世界人民争取和平民主斗争中的日本人民斗争的必然胜利的前途，没有给以应有的郑重的指明，这应该是很重要的缺点。此外，对于反对美日反动派的广泛的日本人民统一战线，也缺少深入的分析。
            《反对美国重新武装日本》
            天津宣传手册社编  知识书店出版
    本书内容包括周恩来外长关于对日和约问题的声明，本报有关反对美帝国主义单独媾和、武装日本的阴谋的两篇社论，苏联和美国关于对日和约问题的交换文件，以及我国和苏联抗议美帝国主义擅释日本战犯的文件，最后附以一九四二年的二十六国宣言，一九四三年的开罗会议宣言，一九四五年的波茨坦公告（节录），一九四七年的远东委员会对日基本政策。这是编辑得相当完整的一本小册子。
