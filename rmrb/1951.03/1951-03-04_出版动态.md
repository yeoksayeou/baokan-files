*“Learning Translation Series” and the Elementary Edition of "Learning"*

The Learning Magazine Publishing House is launching "Learning Translation Series" as a supplementary reading material to "Learning" magazine. To help cadres, workers, and young students study politics and culture, it plans to publish an elementary edition of Learning Magazine within March.

The content of "Learning Translation Series" mainly consists of translations of theoretical articles from Soviet magazines and newspapers such as "Party Education" and "Bolshevik," introductions to Marxist-Leninist classic works, updates on theoretical research, and methods and experiences of theoretical education within the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The translation series is tentatively scheduled to be published every two months.

The elementary edition of "Learning" will publish a "Reader of Political Common Knowledge" for readers who are beginning to learn political theory for self-study and for political instructors to use for teaching. It will include explanations and supplements to the textbook text, as well as necessary study outlines, Q&A, glossary of terms, etc., as well as common knowledge of various subjects and current affairs explanations.

*“Current Affairs Handbook” and New Columns in “Science Pictorial”*

The "Current Affairs Handbook" has launched a column called "Introduction to New China's Construction" starting from its eighth issue, and added another column called "Understanding Our Great Motherland" from its ninth issue. These introductions are very beneficial. The former uses specific materials to describe the new face of New China that is improving every day; the latter helps readers systematically understand our great motherland. In the former column, articles about the achievements of railway and water conservancy construction have already been published; in the latter column, the first article is Mr. Huang Guozhang's "China is a Great Country," which provides a brief explanation of the great motherland geographically.

"Science Pictorial," with its 19-year long history, is a popular science publication that should be recommended. Starting from the first issue of Volume 17, the journal published a serialized "Inventions of Our Ancestors" in the style of traditional Chinese novels, attempting to record the creations and inventions of our ancient sages from 2600 BC in a more popular style.

*“Life Knowledge” Calls for Serious Handling of Readers' Letters*

Seriously handling readers' letters is an important method for newspapers and periodicals to connect with the masses, unite the masses, and educate the masses. The Northeast Regional Committee of the Communist Youth League has paid special attention to this issue. Recently, its official publication "Life Knowledge" (published every five days) published "The Decision of the Northeast Youth League Committee on the Work of Readers' Letters in 'Life Knowledge'" in its 108th issue. The decision emphasized: "The newspaper strengthens its connection with the masses not only for the needs of propaganda work, but also for the needs of the Party and League's organizational work. … A well-handled reader's letter will have a good influence in the masses. A poorly handled one will have the opposite effect. The newspaper must handle readers' letters responsibly, cautiously, and promptly. It is wrong to accumulate and delay, or to reply casually and irresponsibly, or even to ignore them." These words and the working methods provided in this decision are of great value and help to periodicals in various places in handling readers' letters.

*Periodicals Should Value Book Review Work*

Many periodicals such as "New Construction," "Literary Gazette," "People's Education," "Learning," "New Education," "China Youth," "Democratic Youth," "Progressive Youth," "New China Women," "Friendship," "Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Science Bulletin," and "Science Popularization Communication" publish book reviews relatively frequently, but very few publications have established book review columns to conduct book reviews in a planned manner. Correct book reviews are very helpful for readers in selecting books and for the progress of publishing work. It is hoped that general periodicals will pay attention to this work, add a "Book Review" column or frequently publish book review manuscripts according to their nature and target readers, to serve readers and encourage publishers to publish more good books.

*Two New Joint Organizations in the Publishing Industry*

Two new joint organizations in the publishing industry were established in Shanghai last month: the United Map Publishing House and the United Children's Book Publishing and Distribution Store (referred to as "Tonglian Bookstore," which is an expanded organization of Tonglian Publishing House). Among the currently published maps, there are still several shortcomings, and the phenomenon of duplication is quite serious. These situations can be gradually improved after the establishment of the United Map Publishing House. The phenomenon of duplication in children's books is even more serious, and even individual bookstores publish the same book under different names. Tonglian Bookstore states that its main business is the planned publication and unified distribution of children's books, which should be welcomed.

*Two Newly Published Books on Logic*

Two Soviet books on logic have been published in translation: one is "Logic" by Strogovich, translated by Cao Baohua and Xie Ning, published by Xinhua Bookstore, which was originally intended as a university textbook; the other is "Logic" by Vinogradov and Kuzmin, translated by Qi Dayan, published by Zhonghua Book Company, which is a Soviet middle school textbook. Both books attempt to give a materialist explanation of logic from a Marxist perspective, providing the necessary knowledge about the laws of correct thinking, about the logical forms of thought expression and thought development. The relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics is discussed in a special chapter in the book "Logic."

*“History of the Korean National Liberation Struggle” Published*

Many readers hope to be able to systematically understand the fighting history of the Korean people. The book "History of the Korean National Liberation Struggle" can meet the needs of readers. This book was compiled by Kim Il-sung University in North Korea and translated into Chinese by Professor Ma Chaoqun and Li Qilie, Korean professors at Peking University, and published by Shanghai Oriental Bookstore. The book focuses on analyzing the growth history of the Korean proletariat, the history of anti-Japanese struggle, the history of the Korean people led by Kim Il-sung helping the Chinese people in the anti-Japanese struggle in Northeast China, and Soviet assistance to Korea. It is a 25-open book, 172 pages, priced at 7,500 yuan. This book is one of the "New Era Asian Series" edited by Ji Xianlin, Zhang Liqian, etc. Two books have been published in this series, in addition to the above-mentioned one, the other is "History of the Vietnamese People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle."

　　出版动态
    《学习译丛》和《学习》初级版
    学习杂志社创刊《学习译丛》，作为《学习》杂志的补助读物；并为帮助干部、职工和青年学生学习政治与文化，准备在三月内出版学习杂志的初级版。
    《学习译丛》的内容，主要是翻译苏联《党的教育》、《布尔什维克》等杂志和报纸上的理论文章，马列主义经典著作的介绍文字，理论研究的动态以及联共（布）党内理论教育的方法和经验等。译丛暂定每两月出版一辑。
    “学习”初级版将刊登一种准备给初学政治理论的读者自修和政治教员讲授用的《政治常识读本》，解释、补充课本的文字和必要的学习提纲、问题解答、名词解释等，以及各科常识和时事解说。
            《时事手册》与《科学画报》的新栏目
    《时事手册》从第八期起辟了《新中国建设介绍》一栏，从第九期起又添了“认识我们伟大的祖国”一栏。这些介绍都很有益。前者以具体材料叙述新中国的每天在改进着的新的面貌；后者帮助读者有系统地认识我们伟大的祖国。在前一栏，已经发表的有关于铁路和水利建设的成绩；在后一栏，第一篇文章是黄国璋先生的“中国是一个大国”，就地理上将伟大祖国作了简要的说明。
    具有十九年长期历史的“科学画报”，是一种应该推荐的通俗科学刊物。该刊从第十七卷一期起，发表了用章回体连载的“我们祖先的创造发明”，企图用比较通俗的体裁纪述从纪元前二六○○年起我国历代先哲创造发明的事物。
            “生活知识”号召严肃处理读者来信
    严肃地处理读者来信，是报纸期刊联系群众，团结群众与教育群众的重要方法。青年团的东北区区委员会特别注意了这一问题，最近它的机关刊物“生活知识”（五日刊）第一○八期上，发表了“东北团委关于“生活知识”读者来信工作的决定”。决定中强调指出：“报社加强联系群众，不仅是为了宣传工作的需要，也是为了党和团的组织工作的需要。…一封读者来信处理得好，在群众中将产生与传播良好的影响。处理得不好，便恰得其反。报社必须认真负责，慎重迅速地处理读者的来信，积压拖延，或不负责任地随便答复，甚至置之不理，是错误的。”这些话和这个决定中所提供的工作方法，对各地期刊在处理读者来信这一工作上，是有很大价值和帮助的。
            期刊应重视书评工作
    许多期刊如《新建设》、《文艺报》、《人民教育》、《学习》、《新教育》、《中国青年》、《民主青年》、《进步青年》、《新中国妇女》、《友谊》、《中苏友好》、《科学通报》、《科学普及通讯》等都比较经常刊登书评文字，但设立书评专栏有计划地进行书评的刊物还很少。正确的书评文字对于读者选书和出版工作的进步是极有帮助的。希望一般的期刊都重视这个工作，根据它的性质和特定读者对象，添设“书评”栏或时常刊登书评文稿，来为读者服务，并鼓励出版家多出好书。
            两个出版业的新的联合组织
    上月内上海成立了两个出版业的新的联合组织：地图联合出版社和儿童读物出版业联合书店（简称《童联书店》，是童联出版社的扩大组织）。目前已出版的地图中，一般多还存在着若干缺点，重复的现象更相当严重，地图联合出版社成立以后，这些情形当可以逐渐改善。儿童读物中的重复现象更其严重，甚至个别的书店将同样的书采用不同的名称出版。童联书店标明它的主要业务是儿童读物的计划出版和统一发行，这是应该受到欢迎的。
            两本新出的逻辑书
    苏联的两种逻辑学的书籍已有译本书版出版：一本是斯特罗果维契著，曹葆华、谢宁合译，新华书店版“逻辑”，原是作大学教材用的；另一本是维诺格拉道夫、古齐明合著，齐大衍译，中华书局版“逻辑学”，是苏联的中学教本。这两本书都是企图从马克思主义观点，给与逻辑学以唯物论的解释，提供关于正确思惟规律、关于思想表现和思想发展的逻辑形式的必要的知识。关于形式逻辑与唯物辩证法的相互关系，在“逻辑”一书中有专章讨论。
            “朝鲜民族解放斗争史”出版
    很多读者希望能够较有系统地了解朝鲜人民的战斗历史。“朝鲜民族解放斗争史”一书，可以满足读者这样需要。本书由朝鲜金日成综合大学编著，北京大学朝鲜籍教授马超群、李启烈译成中文，上海东方书社出版。全书着重分析了朝鲜无产阶级的成长史、反日斗争史、以金日成为首的朝鲜人民在东北帮助中国人民的抗日斗争史，以及苏联对朝鲜的援助。二五开本，一七二页，定价七五○○元。本书是季羡林、张礼千等主编的“新时代亚洲小丛书”之一，这个丛书已出了两本，除上述一本外，另一本是“越南人民反帝斗争史”。
