　　(II) Rural Propagandists Should Intensify Propaganda to Prepare for Spring Plowing

　　In some areas of Northeast China, rural propagandists, under the leadership of the Party committees, have begun propaganda for spring plowing preparation. This is timely. Whether in old or new areas, wherever propaganda networks have been established, the Party committees should seriously understand the urgent needs and production enthusiasm of the peasants, propose spring plowing production slogans and propaganda outlines suitable for the local peasants' needs, and, through rural propagandists, widely mobilize the masses to form a propaganda campaign for spring plowing and increased production.

　　Spring plowing propaganda is one of the central tasks of rural propagandists today. As spring plowing is about to begin, rural propagandists everywhere should become active. In propaganda, it is not only necessary to publicize the specific production tasks of a village or a mutual aid team, but also to pay special attention to publicizing the overall task of national agricultural production today, publicizing the achievements of agricultural production in 1950, and calling on farmers to participate in the national patriotic production competition movement. The propaganda of agricultural production must be combined with resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, so that everyone knows that strengthening the country's economic construction and striving for a bumper harvest of crops are the specific tasks of the rear's peasants in resisting America and aiding Korea, and should encourage people to participate in the production movement with greater efforts. The Anju Village Party Branch in Zhaodong County put forward the propaganda slogan "The front wins battles, the rear must work harder in production," which is very good. Various similar propaganda slogans should be used everywhere to mobilize the masses.

　　Now, the mutual aid team led by Li Shunda has taken the lead in challenging mutual aid teams across the country to guarantee a bumper harvest of crops this year. This is an important link in carrying out a nationwide patriotic production movement in rural areas. Propagandists in areas with mutual aid teams should thoroughly publicize the conditions of Li Shunda's challenge to the peasants, encourage everyone to accept the challenge, and mobilize all mutual aid team members to participate in the production competition.

　　（二）农村宣传员应加紧宣传准备春耕
    东北有些地区农村宣传员在党委领导下开始了准备春耕的宣传。这是适合时宜的。无论在老区或是新区，凡是建立宣传网的地方，党委均应认真了解农民的迫切要求和生产情绪，提出适合于当地农民需要的春耕生产口号和宣传提纲，经过农村宣传员，广泛动员群众，形成春耕增产的宣传运动。
    春耕宣传是农村宣传员今天的中心任务之一。在春耕即将开始的时候，各地农村宣传员都应当活跃起来。在宣传中，不但要宣传一个村，一个互助组的具体的生产任务，还应该特别注意宣传今天全国农业生产的总任务，宣传一九五○年农业生产的成绩，号召农民参加全国农民爱国主义的生产竞赛运动。农业生产的宣传必须和抗美援朝保家卫国结合起来，使大家知道，加强祖国经济建设、争取农作物丰收是后方农民在抗美援朝中的具体任务，应鼓舞人们以更大努力参加生产运动。肇东县安居村党支部向群众提出了“前方打胜仗，后方生产越要加劲”宣传口号，这是很好的。各地均应有各种类似的宣传口号来动员群众。
    现在，李顺达所领导的互助组已首先向全国各地互助组提出保证今年农作物丰收的挑战。这是在农村中开展全国性的爱国生产运动的重要一环，凡是有互助组地区的宣传员都应当向农民深入宣传李顺达挑战的条件，鼓舞大家应战，动员全体互助组员参加生产竞赛。
