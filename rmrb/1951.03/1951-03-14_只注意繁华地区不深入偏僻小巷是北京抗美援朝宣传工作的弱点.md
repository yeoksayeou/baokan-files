To the Editor:

　　The great patriotic movement of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending the Home and Country, as well as opposing American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, has unfolded nationwide. However, I believe that the current propaganda work is not widespread or deep enough, especially among the vast, unorganized urban masses. These people are busy with their livelihoods all day long, and coupled with the fact that many are illiterate, they cannot read newspapers and rarely listen to the radio, and they have no time to study. Even if the police station holds one or two meetings occasionally, some people are not used to meetings and are not interested in them; others send their children to fill the numbers. As a result, many people do not understand the significance of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and cannot connect it with their own vital interests. Therefore, some people adopt a wait-and-see and indifferent attitude towards this, thinking that "if the sky falls, it will crush everyone." This shows that our propaganda work has not achieved the depth of being "known to every household." Propaganda workers and propaganda teams only pay attention to factories, schools, and prosperous streets, such as the Qianmen and Chongwenmen areas. In remote places such as back streets and alleys, there are very few propaganda activities, which leaves many people outside the movement.

　　I suggest that the propaganda forms for Resisting America and Aiding Korea should make more use of dramas, songs, waist drum teams, yangko teams, etc., which are popular with the masses, and should be combined with various propaganda or mobilizing the masses to accuse American imperialism and Japanese invaders of their crimes of aggression. In short, we should change the past tendency of only paying attention to main streets and prosperous areas, ignoring alleys and remote places; only caring about organized masses, and ignoring the general unorganized masses.

　　只注意繁华地区不深入偏僻小巷是北京抗美援朝宣传工作的弱点编辑同志：
    抗美援朝保家卫国及反对美国帝国主义重新武装日本这样伟大的爱国主义运动在全国范围内展开了，但目前在宣传工作上，我认为还不够普遍和深入，特别是对广大的无组织的市民群众。因为这些人整天为生活奔忙，再加认字的不多，不能看报纸，也很少能听广播，没有时间学习。即使偶尔在派出所开一两次会，而有些人又不惯于开会，对开会不感兴趣；有的则叫孩子去顶数。以致不少群众对抗美援朝的意义还不大了解，不能和自己的切身利益联系起来。因此，某些群众对此采取观望及漠不关心的态度，以为“天塌压大家”。这说明我们在宣传工作上没有做到“家喻户晓”的深入程度。宣传工作者及宣传队，只注意到工厂、学校及繁华的街道，如前门、崇文门内一带。在背街小巷等偏僻的地方，却很少看到有什么宣传活动，这就使很多人停留在运动之外。
    我建议对抗美援朝的宣传形式，最好多利用适合广大群众喜爱的演剧、唱歌、腰鼓队、秧歌队等，并配合着各种宣传或发动群众控诉美国帝国主义及日寇的侵略罪行等办法。总之应改变过去只注意大街及繁华地区，不管小巷及偏僻处所；只顾有组织的群众，不顾一般无组织的群众的偏向。
