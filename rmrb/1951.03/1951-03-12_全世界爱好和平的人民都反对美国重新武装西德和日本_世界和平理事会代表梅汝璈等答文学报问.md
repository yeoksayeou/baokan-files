　　The people of the world who love peace oppose American rearmament of West Germany and Japan
    World Peace Council Representatives Mei Ru'ao and Others Answer Questions from Wenxue Bao
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th Dispatch] TASS reports: The sixth issue of *Wenxue Bao* published on two pages the answers of representatives from thirty-three countries attending the First Session of the World Peace Council to questions posed by the newspaper's reporters. The question was: "What is your country's people's reaction to the attempt by American imperialism to rearm Germany and Japan?" The representatives' answers indicated that the people of all countries unanimously oppose American imperialism's rearming of West Germany and Japan. Soviet representative and Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Solovyov, answered: "The sole purpose of rearming West Germany and Japan is to prepare for a new war and turn the people of Germany and Japan into cannon fodder for American war provocateurs. The Soviet people believe that arming these countries makes it impossible to maintain international peace." Chinese representative Mei Ru'ao answered: "I believe that not only the people of China and other Asian countries, but also all peace-loving people around the world oppose arming Japan. Their joint efforts will surely eliminate the danger of a new war." Indian representative Edward stated: "The common people of India believe that if American imperialism realizes its bloody plan, there will be very few places in the world where people of color are respected and given the opportunity to live." Indonesian representative Cai Xiyin emphasized: "The Indonesian people oppose arming Japan and concluding a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. Indonesian peace supporters demand that the government not participate in any aggressive pacts and oppose the war provocateurs' conspiracies to undermine peace in the East and West."

　　全世界爱好和平的人民都反对美国重新武装西德和日本
    世界和平理事会代表梅汝璈等答文学报问
    【新华社莫斯科十一日电】塔斯社讯：六日的《文学报》以两版篇幅刊载了出席世界和平理事会第一届会议的三十三国代表对该报记者所提出的问题的答复。这个问题就是：“对于美帝国主义重新武装德国和日本的企图，贵国人民的反应如何？”代表们的答复表示了各国人民一致反对美帝国主义重新武装西德和日本。苏联代表、全苏工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫答称：“重新武装西德和日本的唯一目的就是准备新战争和变德日两国人民为美国战争挑拨者的炮灰。苏联人民认为武装这些国家就不可能保持国际和平。”中国代表梅汝璈回答说：“我想不仅是中国和亚洲其他国家的人民，而且全世界爱好和平的人民都反对武装日本。他们的共同努力必能消除新战争的危险。”印度代表爱德华称：“印度普通人民认为：如果美帝国主义实现了它的血腥计划，世界上便很少有这样的地方，那里的有色人受到尊重并得到生活的机会。”印度尼西亚代表蔡锡胤强调称：“印尼人民反对武装日本和缔结片面对日和约。印尼和平拥护者要求政府不参加任何侵略公约，并反对战争挑拨者在东方和西方破坏和平的阴谋。”
