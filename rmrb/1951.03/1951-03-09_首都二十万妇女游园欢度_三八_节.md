Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Nearly 200,000 women from all walks of life in the capital held a grand garden party at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace today (the 8th) to celebrate International Women's Day "March 8th." More than 50 sisters from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Burma were also invited to participate.

　　The garden party began at 10:00 AM. At 12:30 PM, a garden parade was held to the sound of military music. Liu Qingyang, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, said in her speech: To commemorate this year's "March 8th" festival, we must not only summarize the achievements of the past women's movement, but also recognize the work tasks for 1951, work hard to study theory, delve into our professions, and improve ourselves. We must earnestly implement the Beijing Women's Patriotic Convention and strive to oppose American aggression and defend world peace.

　　The garden party was divided into two parts: cultural performances and exhibitions. Participants in the cultural performances included the Central Academy of Drama, the Beijing People's Art Theater, the Youth Art Theater, the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, various public and private girls' middle schools, performing artists, cultural centers in various districts, women's groups, and women from the masses. The performances included opera, yangko opera, dance, singing, quyi, acrobatics, and sports performances, which were warmly welcomed by the audience.

　　The exhibition content was divided into two parts. Outdoors, there were various books, products, etc. Books related to women were sold at a 5% discount; products included food, special crafts, handicrafts, and local products. The indoor exhibition included slides, movies, photos of Soviet women and children and Beijing women's activities over the past year, and exhibits on maternal and child health.

　　Participants in the garden party included female workers, peasant women, female students, government cadres, housewives, and children from elementary schools and kindergartens. Among them, housewives were the most numerous. Elderly women in their seventies and eighties who had not been out of the house for many years and women from suburban areas who had never been to Beijing came to participate in this grand event. One old woman said: "Today I had the happiest day." The garden party ended at 5:00 PM; however, the masses were still not satisfied and requested that it continue. Finally, the conference decided to reopen the exhibition part for one more day on the 11th.

　　首都二十万妇女游园欢度“三八”节
    【新华社八日讯】今（八）日首都各界妇女近二十万人在北京市劳动人民文化宫举行了盛大的游园大会欢度“三八”国际妇女节。苏联、捷克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国、缅甸等国的五十多位姊妹亦应邀参加。
    游园大会于十时开始，十二时半在军乐声中举行游园式。北京市民主妇女联合会副主席刘清扬致词说：纪念今年的“三八”节，不但要总结过去妇女运动的成绩，更要认清一九五一年的工作任务，努力学习理论，精研业务，提高自己。切实执行北京市妇女爱国公约，为反对美国侵略保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    游园大会分文艺演出和展览两部分。参加文艺演出的有中央戏剧学院、北京人民艺术剧院、青年艺术剧院、人民革命军事委员会总政治部文工团、各公私立女子中学、曲艺界艺人、各区文化馆、妇女团体及妇女群众，演出节目有歌剧、秧歌剧、舞蹈、歌咏、曲艺、杂技及体育表演等，受到观众热烈欢迎。
    展览内容分两部分。室外有各种书籍、生产品等。有关妇女书籍均以九五扣出售；生产品包括食品、特种工艺、手工业产品及土产等。室内展览部分有幻灯、电影、苏联妇女儿童和北京妇女一年来活动的照片及妇婴卫生方面的展览品。
    参加游园的包括女工、农妇、女学生、机关干部、家庭妇女和小学幼稚园的小朋友们。其中以家庭妇女为最多。多年不出门的七、八十岁的老太太和从来没有进过北京城的郊区妇女都赶来参加了这个盛会。有一位老太太说：“今天我过了最快乐的一天。”游园大会于午后五时结束；但群众仍未尽兴，纷纷要求继续举行，最后大会决定将展览部分在十一日再开放一天。
