After the Promulgation of the "Regulations on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries"
	Xu Deheng

    "The Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" were promulgated and implemented by the Central People's Government on February 21st. This is a necessary measure to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, maintain revolutionary order, and safeguard the interests of the broad masses of the people. Judicial and public security personnel at all levels should immediately study and strictly implement it. The people of the whole country should regard assisting the government in suppressing counterrevolutionary activities and eliminating the remaining counterrevolutionary forces as the most urgent common task at present.

    In the past year or so, the people's government has achieved considerable success in suppressing counterrevolutionary activities. However, counterrevolutionary elements have not been completely eliminated. They are not reconciled to their demise and are continuing to carry out various sabotage activities under the command of imperialism, especially American imperialism, and the remnant bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek. They sabotage our country's production and construction, sabotage land reform, sabotage the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, steal state secrets and supply them to the enemy, and even openly spread reactionary rumors, commit murder and arson (such as the recent Lingling incident in Hunan), and organize armed riots in an attempt to carry out so-called "mainland guerrilla warfare." Such rampant sabotage behavior shows that although our government's past policy of suppressing counterrevolutionary elements has achieved some success and had a certain effect, it is clearly not enough, and in its implementation, it has shown a rather serious deviation.

    The occurrence of this deviation is mainly because we have not effectively implemented the policy of combining suppression with leniency as stipulated in the Common Program, and have not taken strict, timely, and accurate suppression measures against many counterrevolutionary activities. Some executors have an insufficient understanding and grasp of the spirit of the policy, especially pitting suppression against leniency, one-sidedly emphasizing leniency, and failing to recognize that suppression and leniency are originally two sides of the same policy, complete and indivisible. "Leniency can only be carried out in conjunction with suppression." "For counterrevolutionary elements, the first is suppression; only suppression can make them confess their crimes; only after they confess their crimes can leniency be discussed." (Instruction of the State Council on Strengthening People's Judicial Work)

    It must be pointed out that this right-leaning deviation of "one-sided leniency" has not only created a bad influence among the people, causing the masses to complain to the government about "boundless leniency" and "no law in heaven," but also made the activities of bandits and counterrevolutionaries even more rampant. Due to the government's insufficient suppression of counterrevolutionaries in many areas, the broad masses are harboring some concerns and dare not actively and boldly report and accuse bandits and special agents, and dare not bravely wage a resolute struggle against counterrevolutionary elements. For example, Liu Chengfang, the head of Yiguandao in Fuxian County, Liaodong Province, controlled more than 20,000 followers, spread rumors and incited people, swindled and cheated them, sabotaged land reform, and sabotaged conscription. After being arrested and educated, he was released, and continued to spread rumors and continue his reactionary activities, developing more than 300 followers, attempting to riot in 1950 and seize power. After the case was solved, he was sentenced to only five years in prison with the approval of the provincial court. After a major inspection, the original trial proposed to change the sentence to death. Another example is Nan Shoushan, the leader of the Chiang bandit's Security Bureau who plotted to assassinate General Li Zhaolin in Northeast China, was only sentenced to a short prison term. In Fuzhou, bandit Chen Gongzheng and other eight special agents were all armed counterrevolutionary elements who had repeatedly robbed public and private property as funds for counterrevolutionary activities, and prepared to recruit bandits from Beiling to defect to Baiquan Island. The Fuzhou Public Security Bureau only sentenced the first two to death, and the others to short prison terms. Liu Yongnian, the technical section chief of the pseudo-Lanzhou Second Division captured in Xinjiang, was not sentenced and was rashly released. However, Liu Yongnian was a heinous counterrevolutionary element who buried 1,600 landmines after the liberation of Lanzhou and destroyed Xiangtang Bridge. Longyan County, Fujian, originally an old Soviet area, arrested two incorrigible counterrevolutionary elements, Lian Wenbiao and Lin Xiufeng, last year. These two criminals had committed all kinds of evil deeds before liberation and during the land revolution period, killing more than 50 revolutionary cadres and people, raping women, and extorting money. After the arrest, eighteen widows jointly filed lawsuits, and the masses hated them to the core. However, the county government did not deal with them for more than a year after the arrest, causing the masses to be disappointed and dissatisfied. Some people did not dare to approach our working comrades, which made it difficult to carry out work. Special agents became even more unscrupulous, and they openly said that the Public Security Bureau was a "Public Security Hotel" and called the court a "Judicial Inn." These incorrigible counterrevolutionary bandits took advantage of the "leniency" to continue to carry out criminal activities that endangered the country, and hesitant and wavering reactionary elements were also encouraged. "Boundless leniency" actually condoned the reactionaries and helped the counterrevolution.

    The ideological factors that produce this "one-sided leniency" bias are quite complex. First of all, it must be solemnly pointed out that this is mainly because under the victorious situation, some cadres have shown a serious mentality of peace and paralysis, and have lost the necessary political vigilance against the hidden sabotage activities carried out by the enemy. They are satisfied with the victories and achievements they have achieved, and believe that "Chiang Kai-shek's millions of troops have been defeated by us, and individual counterrevolutionary elements, bandits, and special agents can't accomplish anything great." Therefore, they underestimated the imperialists' covetous ambitions to expand their aggression, did not pay enough attention to the enemy's efforts to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks and carry out sabotage in various ways, and did not give timely and severe exposure and suppression to the counterrevolutionary activities of bandits, special agents, and reactionary sects, such as looting, assassination, spreading rumors, and poisoning. They did not effectively sanction the reactionary illegal landlords who sabotaged land reform or counterattacked to seize land, etc. Obviously, this idea that the enemy would become increasingly docile and quiet with the development of the victorious situation of the revolution and the advancement of national construction is an idea that is divorced from reality and ignorant of class struggle. The result can only be to paralyze one's own sense of smell and create some opportunities for the enemy to carry out sabotage, causing damage to the people. Chairman Mao said, "After the open, visible, and armed enemies are overthrown, the hidden, invisible, and unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably wage a desperate struggle with us." Moreover, today, some counterrevolutionary elements are even holding weapons and openly fighting us, sabotaging the people's revolutionary cause. Therefore, we should not be paralyzed and ignorant of all the enemy's conspiracies, but should maintain a clear mind and clear reason, and proactively and effectively suppress counterrevolutionary activities. "They are only allowed to behave properly, not allowed to talk or move around. If they talk or move around, they will be immediately banned and sanctioned." The purpose of doing so is precisely to protect the democratic interests of the people and the interests of the country.

    Secondly, the emergence of this "one-sided leniency" bias is due to the fact that some people still have some petty-bourgeois "benevolent government" views. They have not yet completely and correctly distinguished between the education and transformation of the people within and the strict suppression of the activities of the enemy outside the people, and they have not yet fully and skillfully used the state apparatus to exercise dictatorship over the enemy. It should be recognized that counterrevolutionary elements must first be suppressed, and only after suppression makes them confess their crimes can leniency be discussed. The so-called leniency also has certain boundaries, that is, "the chief culprits must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and meritorious service will be rewarded." Article 7 of the Common Program also specifically stipulates: "It is imperative to suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary leaders who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause. For general reactionary elements, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists, after disarming them and eliminating their special forces, they must still be deprived of their political rights in accordance with the law within the necessary period, but at the same time, they must be given a way out of life and forced to transform themselves through labor and become new people. If they continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely sanctioned." This is the correct policy of combining suppression with leniency. Education and transformation is a good way to enable some counterrevolutionary elements to turn over a new leaf and make amends for their crimes, but it is not a "panacea" and must be treated differently according to specific circumstances. Facts have proven how dangerous loopholes have occurred in some areas when dealing with counterrevolutionary cases by rashly adopting the policy of "education as the main focus and punishment as the auxiliary focus," giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. In addition, some people hold super-class views such as "revolution is about benevolence" and "revenge cannot be implemented." They have forgotten Chairman Mao's instruction: "We will never practice benevolent government towards the reactionary派 and the reactionary classes. We only practice benevolent government within the people, and not on the reactionary派 and the reactionary classes outside the people." Revolution is naturally not about taking revenge, but just look at how many revolutionary martyrs and patriotic heroes have been killed by the butcher knife of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries since the failure of the Great Revolution! The reactionaries have used all kinds of appalling and brutal methods to deal with revolutionaries and good people. May I ask what kind of "revenge" has the people ever taken? In order to suppress the chief culprits and give the resolute counterrevolutionaries who are "condemned by everyone" the necessary ruthless sanctions, it is a matter that "conforms to the laws of nature and human sentiment" and cannot be called "revenge."

    Again, the reason for this "one-sided leniency" bias is that the theoretical and professional level of many of us cannot closely match our current tasks. Some of us are still more or less bound and influenced by the old state view and legal view in our thinking and understanding. Therefore, in practical work, the understanding of counterrevolutionary crimes is still vague, and sometimes even the boundary between the enemy and ourselves is blurred. Chairman Mao often instructed on the importance of "drawing a clear distinction between the reactionary and revolutionary factions." He clearly pointed out that "If the people break the law, they must also be punished, also go to jail, and also face the death penalty, but these are a few individual cases, and there is a fundamental difference from the dictatorship over the reactionary class as a class." Some of our comrades' attitude towards the Marxist-Leninist state view and legal view that runs through Chairman Mao's revolutionary principles is often not very practical, but superficial, and they cannot well link it with reality to transform their thinking and improve their work. When dealing with counterrevolutionary cases, some of us still cannot resolutely get rid of the shackles of the old criminal law views and super-class formalism ideas. Feeling that there is no "counterrevolutionary crime" in the old criminal law, and there is no basis, we confuse the enemy's counterrevolutionary crime with other crimes of the people, ignoring the fundamental differences, intentionally or unintentionally making the enemy and the people "equal before the law." Because of this, there is a feeling that there is no standard for sentencing, so the concepts of attempted crime, accessory, and preparatory crime in the old law for handling general criminal cases are often applied to handling counterrevolutionary cases without principle. The "chief culprit" is not distinguished according to the size of the crime, but according to the size of the position. In this way, the criminal behavior of the reactionary elements who have committed many evils, killed countless people, but are not the "chiefs" in the reactionary positions is regarded as "obedience to orders," "duty crime," and "coercion," so the sentence is "mitigated" or leniency is given, and even the smaller heads are regarded as "coerced" and not treated as "accomplices." There are also incorrect understandings of "meritorious service." Often, forced surrender or forced "confession" after being arrested is also regarded as "meritorious service." Therefore, without starting from the specific facts, without looking at the size of the "merit" and "demerit," without asking whether the "merit" and "demerit" can offset each other, and the specific circumstances such as active and passive, the principle of "reward for meritorious service" is mechanically applied, and mitigation or exemption is given, which destroys the spirit and essence of the policy principles. Some people also overemphasize "criminal motives," "social causes," "age," "composition," and "first-time offender" and "reality," and "statute of limitations," etc., while ignoring the harmfulness of their sabotage activities to the revolution. For example, when a certain county in Fujian handled a case in which armed bandits and special agents robbed the masses, and the masses resisted and fought each other, and the bandits and special agents shot and killed the masses, a comrade said: "This bandit did not intentionally kill people, but had to shoot." This is neglecting the harmfulness of the counterrevolution to the people from the so-called "criminal motive," as if the bandit and special agents killed people were still acting in proper "self-defense." Although this confused thinking is individual, it is serious. In addition, some comrades consider the starting point of the problem to be the age of the counterrevolutionary elements is still young, "there may still be a future," "the composition is not too bad," etc., rather than giving the deserved punishment based on the degree of harm that the counterrevolutionary elements have caused to the interests of the country and the people. Obviously, there is no need to explain that all these thoughts are completely wrong. When we handle cases, we must proceed from the interests of the broadest masses of the people, and not from individual, old legal views. This is the fundamental point of view for handling all problems, and it must be firmly established in all judicial cadres.

    In short, in the past year or so, the right-leaning deviation of "one-sided leniency" that has occurred in our handling of counterrevolutionary cases is quite widespread and serious. Naturally, there are also some over-left deviations of random beatings and killings, but that is still individual, and since the establishment of people's courts in various places, this phenomenon has been corrected. All these "left" and right-leaning deviations should be resolutely corrected and prevented. Everyone should thoroughly understand how serious damage our past bias of "boundless leniency" has caused to the people's revolutionary cause; on the other hand, how it has invisibly encouraged counterrevolutionary elements to actively do evil and intensify their counterrevolutionary and anti-people criminal activities. Especially since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, and since American imperialism occupied Taiwan with armed forces and openly announced its continued support for the Chiang bandit gang's counterrevolutionary activities, the sabotage activities of bandits and special agents have become even more rampant and blatant. In many areas, there have been facts of bandits and special agents and evil landlords shooting and killing our government cadres, reversing the results of the struggle against peasants, committing arson and robbery, and preparing for armed riots to seize power. This lawless reactionary behavior is intolerable to every revolutionary person. The People's Government has the responsibility to correct and stop this phenomenon, to completely eliminate all counterrevolutionary activities and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Recently, due to the improvement of the people's political awareness and the repeated instructions of the People's Government to severely suppress counterrevolutionaries, the bias of "one-sided leniency" towards counterrevolutionary elements in various places has been gradually corrected. For example, Xiangxi is a region where banditry has been rampant for hundreds of years. Under the strong cooperation of the military and civilians, and the military encirclement and political offensive, the reactionary rule of bandits and bullies that was like a mountain pressing on the people was fundamentally crushed, and more than 92,000 bandits and special bullies who committed heinous crimes were punished as they deserved. In addition, in Fujian, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and other provinces, as long as the government actively mobilized the masses and corrected the deviation of "boundless leniency," the ferocity of the counterrevolutionary elements was suppressed. When righteousness is upheld, evil will naturally decline. This is an inevitable trend.

    Stalin said: "The more the power of the state grows, the more fierce the resistance of the last remnants of the dying class will be." Chairman Mao also called on us to "resolutely eliminate all bandits, special agents, bullies, and other counterrevolutionary elements who endanger the people." "The whole party and the people of the whole country must raise their vigilance against the conspiracies of counterrevolutionary elements." Therefore, the "Regulations on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" recently promulgated by the Central People's Government is a timely and correct measure. We know that if bandits and special agents are not eliminated, land reform cannot be completed smoothly, and if land reform is not completed, feudal forces cannot be destroyed. Government workers at all levels across the country, especially judicial and public security cadres, should conscientiously study this regulation, implement this regulation well, thoroughly correct the bias of "one-sided leniency," establish a correct Marxist-Leninist legal view, strive to improve their ideological and professional level, and in actual work, step up the suppression of all counterrevolutionary activities, severely punish counterrevolutionary elements, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and safeguard the long-term interests of the state and the people.

　　“惩治反革命条例”公布以后
     许德珩
    “中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例业经中央人民政府于二月二十一日公布施行。这是巩固人民民主专政，维护革命秩序，保障广大人民利益的必要措施，各级司法、公安人员，应即认真研究，并严格执行，全国人民更应以协助政府镇压反革命活动，肃清反革命的残余势力，为当前最迫切的共同任务。
    过去一年多来，人民政府对于反革命活动的镇压，已经获得了不少的成绩，但反革命分子还未完全肃清，他们并不甘心死亡，他们还在帝国主义尤其是美帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮指挥之下，继续进行各种破坏活动。他们破坏我们国家的生产建设，破坏土地改革，破坏抗美援朝爱国运动，盗窃国家的机密，供给敌人，甚至公开散布反动谣言，杀人放火（如最近湖南所发生的零陵事件）组织武装暴动妄图进行所谓“大陆游击”。这种猖狂的破坏行为，说明了我们政府过去对于反革命分子的镇压政策虽然有了一些成绩，收到了一定的效果，但显然还是不够的，而且在执行上是表现了相当严重的偏向的。
    这偏向的发生，主要是我们过去没有切实贯彻共同纲领所规定的镇压与宽大相结合的方针，对于许多反革命活动没有采取严厉的、及时的、稳准的镇压：有些执行人员，对政策精神的领会和掌握都不够，特别是把镇压与宽大对立起来，片面地强调宽大，而没有认识到镇压与宽大原是一个政策的两面，是完整的，不可分割的“宽大只能结合着镇压来进行”，“对反革命分子来说，首先是镇压，只有镇压才能使他们服罪，只有在他们服罪之后，才能谈到宽大。”（政务院关于加强人民司法工作的指示）
    必须指出，这种“片面宽大”的右倾偏向，不但在人民群众中造成了不好的影响，使群众对政府发出了“宽大无边”“有天无法”的怨言，而且使匪特反革命的活动更形猖獗起来。广大群众亦由于政府在许多地区对反革命镇压不够，存有若干顾虑，不敢积极大胆的检举和控告匪特，不敢勇敢地向反革命分子进行坚决的斗争。例如辽东省复县一贯道头子刘成芳管辖两万多道徒，造谣煽惑，骗奸骗财，破坏土改，破坏参军，被捕经教育后释放，仍然大肆造谣并继续反动，发展三百余道徒，企图于一九五○年暴动，夺取政权，破案后经省院批准才判五年徒刑。以后经过一次大检查，才由原审提出，改处死刑。又如东北对密谋暗杀李兆麟将军的蒋匪保密局组长南守善，仅判以短期徒刑。福州市匪特陈功政等八人，均系武装反革命分子，曾迭次抢劫公私财物，作为反革命活动经费，并准备收编北岭股匪投奔白犬岛，福州市公安机关只判处前二名死刑，其他判以短期徒刑。新疆捕获的伪兰州二处技术课长刘永年，竟未判刑，轻率释放，而刘永年却是罪大恶极的反革命分子，在兰州解放后，他还埋地雷一千六百个，并炸毁了享堂桥。原是老苏区的福建龙岩县，去年逮捕了两名怙恶不悛的反革命分子连文镳林秀峰，这两个罪犯在解放以前和土地革命时期，就无恶不作，杀死我革命干部和群众五十余人，强奸妇女，抢劫勒索，更不计其数。逮捕后，有十八个寡妇联名告状，群众都恨之入骨，但是县政府逮捕一年多也没处理，致使群众由失望而不满。有些群众则看到我们的工作同志也不敢靠近，使得开展工作都遭到了困难。特务分子因此更肆无忌惮，他们竟公然说公安局是“公安店”，称法院为“司法旅馆”。这些怙恶不悛的反革命匪徒利用“宽大”的空子，继续进行危害国家的罪恶活动，而犹豫动摇的反动分子也因此得到了鼓励。“宽大无边”实际上是纵容了反动派，帮助了反革命。
    产生这种“片面宽大”的偏向的思想因素是相当复杂的。首先，必须郑重指出，这主要是因为在胜利的形势下面，一部分干部表现了严重的太平麻痹思想，对敌人所进行的隐蔽的破坏活动，失去了应有的政治警觉性。他们满足于既得的胜利和成绩，认为“蒋介石几百万军队都被我们打垮了，个别的反革命分子，土匪，特务成得了什么大事”，因而对帝国主义正虎视眈眈准备扩大侵略的阴谋估计不足，对敌人正自各方面千方百计钻入革命阵营进行破坏注意不够，对匪特、反动道门的抢劫、暗杀、造谣、放毒等反革命活动未予以及时地严厉地揭露和镇压，对反动的不法地主，破坏土地改革或反攻夺地未作有效地制裁等等。很明显的，这种认为随着革命胜利形势的发展和国家建设事业的推进，敌人就会日益驯服和安静的想法，是一种脱离实际，对于阶级斗争无知的想法，其结果只能是麻痹了自己的嗅觉而给敌人造成了若干进行破坏的机会，造成了对人民的损害。毛主席说过“在公开的、有形的、拿枪的敌人被打倒之后，隐蔽的、无形的、不拿枪的敌人依然存在，而且他们必然要和我们作拚死的斗争。”何况今天有些反革命分子竟拿着武器，公然和我们作斗争，破坏人民革命事业，因此，我们对敌人的一切阴谋活动不但不应该麻痹无知，而且应该保持清醒的头脑和明确的理智，主动地有效地镇压反革命活动。“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁”。这样做的目的，正是在于保障人民民主的利益，保障国家的利益。
    其次，产生这种“片面宽大”的偏向，是由于有的人还存在着一些小资产阶级的“仁政”观点，他们对人民内部的教育改造和对人民外部敌人活动的严厉镇压还没有完全正确地区别清楚，还没有充分娴熟地运用国家机构对敌人进行专政。应该认识，对反革命分子首先必须镇压，只有镇压使他们服罪之后才谈得到宽大。所谓宽大，也是有一定的分际的，即“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖。”共同纲领第七条也具体规定：“必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。对于一般的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利，但同时给以生活出路，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁。”这便是镇压与宽大相结合的正确方针。教育改造是可以使一部分反革命分子改邪归正立功赎罪的良好办法，但却不是“万应灵丹”，必须根据具体情况，分别对待。事实证明：有些地区在处理反革命案件时，轻率地采取“教育为主，惩办为辅”的方针，发生了多么危险的漏洞，给予了敌人以可乘之机。另外也有些人存在着“革命是讲仁爱的”“不能实行报复”等超阶级的看法。他们忘记了毛主席的指示：“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施行仁政。我们仅仅施仁政于人民内部，而不施于人民外部的反动派和反动阶级的反动行为”。革命自然不是采取报复主义，但试看自从大革命失败以来，蒋介石国民党反动派的屠刀杀死了多少革命志士、爱国英雄！反动派用尽了一切骇人听闻的残暴手段对付革命者和善良的人们，试问人民何尝采取了什么“报复主义”？为了镇压元凶首恶，给“国人皆曰可杀”的坚决反革命以必要的无情的制裁，是“顺乎天理、合乎人情”的事，不能够叫做什么“报复主义”的。
    再次，产生这种“片面宽大”偏向的原因，是我们许多人的理论水平与业务水平和我们当前的任务不能密切的配合的缘故，我们有些人在思想上、认识上还或多或少地被旧的国家观、法律观所束缚、所影响，因之，在实际工作中，对反革命犯罪的认识仍旧是模糊的，有时甚至把敌我的界限混淆了。毛主席常常指示“划清反动派和革命派的界限”的重要性，他明白指出“人民犯了法，也要处罚，也要坐班房，也有死刑，但这是若干个别的情形，和对于反动阶级当作一个阶级的专政来说，有原则的区别。”我们有些同志对于贯串在毛主席革命原理中的马克思、列宁主义国家观与法律观的态度，往往不是很切实的，而是浮面的，不能很好联系实际去改造思想和改进工作。我们有些人在处理反革命案件时还不能坚决摆脱旧刑法观点和超阶级的形式主义思想的束缚，感到旧刑法分则上没有“反革命罪”，无所依据，就把敌人的反革命罪和人民的其他犯罪混淆在一起，漠视原则的区别，有意无意地使敌人和人民“在法律面前一律平等”。正因为如此，对于量刑，就感觉漫无标准，于是将旧法律上处理一般刑事案件的未遂犯、从犯、预备犯等概念经常无原则地运用到处理反革命案件上去。对“首恶”不是按照罪恶的大小来区别，而是按照职位的大小来区别。这样就把作恶多端，杀人无数，但在反动职位上不是“首”的反动分子的犯罪行为，看做是“受命”，是“职务犯罪”，是“胁从”，因而在量刑时便予“从轻”或宽纵，甚至把其中较小的头目，也看成是“胁从”，不当作“共犯”处理。对“立功”也有错误的认识，往往把被迫投降或被捕后被迫“坦白”也看成是“立功”，因而不从具体事实情况出发，不看“功”“过”大小，不问“功”“过”能否相抵，以及主动被动等具体情况，竟机械地搬用“立功受奖”的原则，予以减轻或减免，这正是破坏了政策原则的精神与实质。也有的过分强调“犯罪动机”“社会原因”“年龄”“成份”以及“初犯”与“现实性”“时效性”等，而忽略了其破坏活动对革命的危害性。例如福建某县处理一件武装匪特抢劫群众，群众抗拒和匪特互殴，匪特开枪打死群众的案件时，有位同志却说：“这个土匪不是故意杀人，而是不得已而开枪的。”这便是从所谓“犯罪动机”而忽视了反革命对人民的危害性，好似匪特杀人还是出于正当“防卫”。这种糊涂思想虽然是个别的，却是严重的。另外有些同志考虑问题的出发点，是反革命分子个人的年龄还青，“还可能有前途”，“成份并不太坏”等等，而不是根据反革命分子所给予国家与人民利益的危害大小，来给以应得的惩处。显然用不着说明，所有这些思想，都是完全错误的。我们处理案件，必须从最广大人民群众的利益出发，而不能从个别的，旧法律观点出发。这是处理一切问题的根本观点，必须在一切司法干部中巩固地树立起来。
    总之，过去一年多来，我们在处理反革命案件上所发生“片面宽大”的右倾偏向，是相当普遍而严重的。自然，乱打乱杀的过左偏向也是有的，但那还是个别的，而且自各地人民法院建立以后，这种现象已经得到了纠正。所有这些“左”右倾的偏向，都应当切实纠正和防止。大家应当彻底了解，我们过去“宽大无边”的偏向对人民革命事业造成了多么严重的损害；在另一方面，又怎样无形中鼓励了反革命分子去积极作恶，加紧其反革命反人民的罪恶活动。尤其是自从美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，自从美帝国主义以武装力量侵占台湾、公然宣布继续支持蒋匪帮的反革命活动以后，匪特的破坏活动是更加猖狂更加露骨起来了。在许多地区，已经发生了匪特和恶霸地主枪杀我政府干部，向农民倒算斗争果实，放火抢劫，以及准备武装暴动，夺取政权的事实。这种无法无天的反动行为，是每一个革命的人民所不能容忍的。人民政府对这种现象尤有纠正和制止的责任，以彻底消灭一切反革命的活动，巩固人民民主专政。
    最近以来，由于人民群众政治觉悟的提高以及人民政府几次三番严厉镇压反革命的指示，各地对反革命分子“片面宽大”的偏向是逐渐地纠正过来了。例如湘西是数百年来匪患猖獗的地区，在军民坚强合作，军事围剿与政治进攻之下，象一座大山一样压在人民头上的匪霸反动统治是根本被打垮了，歼灭了土匪九万二千余名，罪大恶极的匪特恶霸受到了应得的惩罚。此外如福建、广西、广东、湖北、四川、新疆以及其他各省，只要政府积极发动了群众并纠正了“宽大无边”的偏差，反革命分子的凶焰都被打下来了。正气抬头了，邪气自然下降。这是必然的趋势。
    斯大林说过：“国家威力越增长，垂死阶级最后余孽的抵抗也就会愈猛烈。”毛主席也号召我们“必须坚决地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子。”“全党和全国人民对于反革命分子的阴谋活动，必须提高警惕性。”因此，中央人民政府最近颁布的“惩治反革命条例”，是适时的正确措施。我们晓得土匪特务不消灭，土改就不能顺利地完成，土改不完成，封建势力就不能摧毁；全国各级政府工作人员，特别是司法、公安干部应当认真地学习这个条例，很好地执行这个条例，彻底纠正“片面宽大”的偏向，建立马克思、列宁主义的正确的法律观点，努力地提高自己的思想水平和业务水平，并在实际工作中加紧对一切反革命活动的镇压，严厉惩治反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政，保障国家和人民的长远利益。
