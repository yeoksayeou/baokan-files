　　Pyongyang All Circles Commemorate "March 8th" Festival Meeting Sends Salute Telegram to Chairman Mao

To the Great Leader of the Chinese People, the Close Friend of the Korean People, Chairman Mao Zedong:

Today, Korean women, amidst the raging flames of the great Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of the American imperialist aggressors and their running dog, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, together with all the world's democratic women who stand under the banner of defending peace, led by the great Soviet women, commemorate the "March 8th" International Women's Day.

We, the participants of the Pyongyang Municipal All Circles Commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day, on behalf of all Korean women, extend our warm congratulations and highest honor to you, beloved, and to all Chinese women.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong! To defend the independence, freedom, and honor of our motherland, and to oppose the armed aggression of the American imperialists, we Korean women are drawing on the rich and valuable historical lessons learned from the victorious struggles of the great Chinese people and Chinese women in their years of people's revolution against the ferocious imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to overcome all difficulties and hardships and fight heroically.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong! Our Korean and Chinese peoples have a blood-forged friendship relationship through long-term revolutionary struggles. The brotherly friendship and unity cemented by the blood of the Korean and Chinese peoples and Korean and Chinese women is further strengthened today in the just struggle to eliminate our two countries' common enemy—the American imperialist armed aggressors and their running dog, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang. We believe that the Korean and Chinese peoples and the Korean and Chinese women will unite even more closely to resolutely overthrow American imperialism. Finally, for the lasting peace and democracy of the world, for the prosperity of the great People's Republic of China and the freedom of women, and for the happy future of children, we wish you, beloved, a long life!
