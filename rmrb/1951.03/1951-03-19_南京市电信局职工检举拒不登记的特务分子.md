To the Editor:
  During the work of registering reactionary party members, league members, and special agents in Nanjing, many people have exposed special agents who refuse to register. On March 6th, employees of the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau exposed two special agents who did not know how to repent and attempted to "hide."

  Yang Maotian, a special agent of the North Branch of the Telecommunications Bureau, used "ideological backwardness" as a guise to conceal his espionage activities and refused to register. The employees then exposed his true colors: worker Zhou Songtao proved that he had attempted to carry explosives to sabotage the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; and also revealed that he was still developing a spy organization after liberation; when the American invading army landed in Incheon, Korea, he spread rumors, threatening the masses by saying: "The old man (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) is coming back, be careful your heads will move." From a series of facts revealed by the employees, it was proved that Yang Maotian had consistently been engaged in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. The Public Security Bureau accepted the request of all employees and arrested him.

  Zhao Xiguang, the foreman of the Line Section, was a Kuomintang member and feudal bully. In the past, he had relied on his power to oppress workers for more than 20 years, and he still did not know how to repent after liberation. Last spring, he deliberately damaged a 400-pair, 130-meter-long cable, causing great losses to the people's property. During this registration of reactionary party members, league members, and special agents, he again refused to register. According to the accusations of the employees of the factory, in the two years before liberation alone, more than 30 workers were extorted by him for gold, silver dollars, and rice, totaling more than 23 million yuan in Renminbi. The workers hated him very much and called him "living阎王 (Yan Wang - King of Hell)." After the exposure by all the workers, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also arrested him.

  南京市电信局职工
  检举拒不登记的特务分子编辑同志：
    在南京市反动党团、特务人员登记工作中，很多群众检举拒不登记的特务。三月六日，南京市电信局职工就检举了两个不知悔悟、企图“隐藏”的特务。
    电信局北分局特务杨茂田，以“思想落后”为幌子，掩饰他的特务行动，拒绝登记。职工们就揭发了他的真面目：工人周松涛证明他曾企图携带爆炸物，破坏中共南京市委会；又揭发他解放后还在发展特务组织；当美国侵略军在朝鲜仁川登陆时，他曾散布谣言，威胁群众说：“老头子（指蒋匪）要回来了，当心你们的头要搬家。”从职工揭发的一连串事实中，证明了杨茂田一贯地在进行着反革命的破坏活动。公安局就接受全体职工的要求，予以逮捕。
    线路科领班赵锡光，是国民党员、封建恶霸分子。过去仗势欺压工人二十余年，解放后，他仍不知悔改。去年春天，他有意破坏了四百对一百三十公尺长的电缆，使人民财产遭受极大损失。这次反动党团、特务人员登记时，他又拒绝登记。据该厂职工控诉，仅在解放前二年中，有三十多个工人被他榨取的黄金、银元、大米计合人民币二千三百多万元之巨。工人们对他痛恨万分，称之为“活阎王”。经过全体工人的检举，市公安局也把他逮捕了。
