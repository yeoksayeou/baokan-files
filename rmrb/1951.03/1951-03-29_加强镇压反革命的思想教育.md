Strengthen Ideological Education on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
    Tan Pingshan

Currently, strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is an important task for consolidating the people's democratic united front and the people's democratic dictatorship. This task, needless to say, is in line with the interests of all the Chinese people.

We have seen the recent rampant activities of bandits and secret agents, and their various sabotage conspiracies. For example, last year, secret agents conspired to shell Tiananmen Square on October 1st. For example, secret agents set fires in Lingling during the Spring Festival. Also, bandits and secret agents in various places have been disguising themselves as progressive elements, infiltrating organs, organizations, and parties, or using false pretenses to conceal themselves and commit evil deeds. These things are truly shocking. Therefore, we must heighten our vigilance to avoid losses to the great revolutionary cause.

Here, we should especially recognize clearly that with the victory of the revolution, the criminal activities of counter-revolutionary elements will certainly become more rampant and more inhuman. Because as long as US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang under its protection exist for a day, they will not give up, and they will not stop infiltrating all levels of government organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations to lie dormant for a long time, waiting for opportunities to sabotage.

In the past year or more, the public security departments have made considerable achievements in suppressing bandits and secret agents, and the people have reported counter-revolutionary elements. However, to completely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, we still need a period of effort. Therefore, we must strengthen ideological education on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so that everyone knows the responsibility they should bear in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. When we study the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," we should not regard these regulations merely as legal provisions, but as documents for ideological education in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, to enhance political awareness and political vigilance.

We, who have gone through a brutal struggle with counter-revolutionaries, naturally have deep hatred for the US-Chiang agents. But we also come from the old society, and it is always difficult to avoid some feudal baggage. Because of various relationships with subordinates, colleagues, relatives, fellow villagers, teachers, and classmates, we often develop affection, which makes us numb and unable to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. This objectively helps the enemy and damages the revolutionary interests of the people of the whole country. Therefore, in today's high tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, it is important to ideologically cut off the feudal tail.

To cut off the feudal tail, we must first introspect and examine whether we have helped the enemy and harmed the people because of affection and numbness. But this is not enough. We must go further and report any counter-revolutionary elements once they are discovered, no matter how close they may have been to us in the past. Our stand must be firm, and the line between the enemy and ourselves must be clearly drawn. Only in this way can we fulfill our responsibility of loving the motherland and the people in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Suppressing counter-revolutionaries and eliminating US-Chiang agents is a broad, mass revolutionary movement. The eyes of the masses are sharp. As long as the people of the whole country consciously, actively, and practically participate in this revolutionary movement, and cooperate with the efforts of the public security departments, counter-revolutionary elements will have no place to hide. We will be able to expose and report their conspiracies to spread rumors, poison, arson, sabotage, and riot at any time. Therefore, at present, ideological education on suppressing counter-revolutionaries must be widely carried out among the masses. The "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" must be strengthened in study among the masses. The crimes of counter-revolutionary elements in harming the interests of the people must be universally exposed to raise the awareness and strengthen the vigilance of the masses. It is very clear that only when the masses rise up and rely on the power of the masses can we victoriously complete the task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　加强镇压反革命的思想教育
    谭平山
    在目前，加强镇压反革命是巩固人民民主统一战线、巩固人民民主专政的重要工作。这工作，不消说，是符合全中国人民的利益的。
    我们看了近来土匪、特务们的猖獗，和他们的各种各样的破坏阴谋，例如特务们去年竟阴谋于十月一日炮击天安门，例如特务们在零陵春节放火，以及各地土匪、特务伪装进步，混入机关、团体、党派，或假借名义掩护埋伏作恶的活动。真令人触目惊心。因此，我们更要高度地提高警惕，避免伟大的革命事业遭受损失。
    在这里，我们应当特别认识清楚的是：随着革命的胜利，反革命分子的罪恶活动也一定更猖狂，更惨无人道。因为美帝国主义及其卵翼下的蒋介石匪帮还存在一天，他们就一天也不会心死的，他们就一天也不会停止其钻进各级政府机关、民主党派及人民团体中去，作长期潜伏，乘机破坏的活动的。
    过去一年多来，公安部门对于土匪、特务的镇压，人民群众对于反革命分子的检举，是有了相当的成绩的；但是要完全肃清反革命分子，还要经过一段时期的努力。因此，我们要加强镇压反革命的思想教育，要使每一个人都知道在镇压反革命运动中应负的责任。当我们学习《惩治反革命条例》的时候，不要把这些条例仅仅看成是法律条文，而要把它当作镇压反革命中思想教育的文献，以提高政治认识，提高政治警惕。
    我们和反革命者经过残酷搏斗的人，对美、蒋特务都有深刻的仇恨，那是当然的。但我们也是来自旧社会的人，总难免背上一些封建包袱，为了部属、同僚、亲戚、同乡、师生、同学各种关系，常常使自己发生温情，因而使自己麻木，分不清敌我界线，这就在客观上帮助了敌人，破坏了全国人民的革命利益。所以在今天镇压反革命的高潮中，在思想上割断封建尾巴，是一件重要的事。
    要割断封建尾巴，首先要自我反省一下，检查一下，是否因温情而麻木而帮助了敌人，危害了人民。但这还不够，我们要更进一步，一经发现了反革命分子之后，就要检举，不论他和自己过去曾有过何等亲密关系；立场必须坚定，敌我界线必须划清。只有这样，在镇压反革命运动中，才算尽了自己爱祖国、爱人民的责任。
    镇压反革命，肃清美蒋特务，是广泛的群众性的革命运动。群众的眼睛才是雪亮的，只要全国人民都自觉地积极地实际参加这个革命运动，并配合着公安部门努力工作，才能使反革命分子无法藏身，才能随时揭发、检举他们造谣、放毒药、纵火、破坏、暴动等阴谋活动。所以，在目前，镇压反革命的思想教育，必须在群众中广泛地展开，《惩治反革命条例》，必须在群众中加强学习，反革命分子危害人民利益的罪恶，必须普遍地暴露，使群众提高认识，加强警惕。很明显的，只有群众起来，依靠群众的力量，我们才能够胜利地完成镇压反革命的任务。
