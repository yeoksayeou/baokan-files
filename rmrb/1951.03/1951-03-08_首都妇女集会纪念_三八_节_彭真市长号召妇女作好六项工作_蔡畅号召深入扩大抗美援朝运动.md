More than 5,000 people attended, including female workers, rural women, female students, female medical workers, female childcare workers, female religious believers, female cadres from government offices, and women representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and districts of Beijing. Women representatives from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Mongolia, India, Burma, Indonesia, and Switzerland in Beijing were also invited to attend. The conference first elected a presidium of fifty people, including Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Zhang Xiaomei, Yang Yunyu, Liu Qingyang, Mrs. Roshchina, Mrs. Weisskopf, and Mrs. Li Zhouyuan.

The conference began with an opening speech by Li Dequan, the executive chairman. This was followed by a speech by Peng Zhen, the Mayor of Beijing. He called on women to do the following six tasks well: First, it is necessary to popularize and deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. Second, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionaries and thoroughly eliminate all spies, bandits, and despots. Third, it is necessary to further mobilize women to participate in democratic political power. Fourth, it is necessary to continue to mobilize women to participate in production and construction. Fifth, it is necessary to vigorously develop health work and protect the health of women and children. Sixth, it is necessary to study culture, politics, and technology.

Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, pointed out in her speech that the significance of commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, as pointed out by the Women's International Democratic Federation, is to unite women all over the world who love peace more widely and strive for world peace through the "March 8th" activities. Chinese women have already taken action under this general goal, and women have participated in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea in various positions, using practical actions to defend world peace. Then, she reported on the brilliant achievements of women across the country in politics, economy, and culture since liberation, and the guarantee of women's rights by the People's Government, which greatly improved women's status and awareness. Finally, she called on women to work harder, deepen and expand the movement to resist America and aid Korea, to realize the patriotic covenants made by women, to build the people's capital, and to build a new China in order to defend a happy life.

Soviet women representative Avdeeva was invited to speak. She described how happy Soviet women, under the great care and help of the great Communist Party and Lenin and Stalin, have become active builders of the socialist country. She used various figures to illustrate the great achievements of Soviet women in Soviet construction. She pointed out that American imperialism intends to ignite a new world war, but the victory of the cause of peace is in the hands of the people.

Kim Un-tak, the wife of the North Korean Ambassador to China, Li Zhouyuan, condemned the crimes of the American invading army in Korea in her speech. She pointed out that women from China and North Korea had jointly opposed Japanese imperialism and are now opposing the common mortal enemy, American imperialism. Finally, she firmly said: "Our struggle is just, the American imperialists will surely perish, and victory will surely belong to us!"

Lu Cui, the head of the Chinese delegation to the recent Berlin International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting, had just returned from Moscow and rushed from the airport to attend the conference. She reported on the love and respect of peace-loving women all over the world for Chinese women. Liang Keping, a representative of the delegation, also conveyed the various resolutions and spirits of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting at the meeting.

Passed resolutions to support the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the International Women's Federation Council.

Finally, the conference unanimously adopted a resolution to support the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the International Democratic Women's Federation Council, and also passed congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, Ms. Gordon, Chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation, Mr. Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, and Asian women.
