    Chinese and Korean People's Anti-American Aid Korea Volunteer Engineering Team Actively Opens Mountains and Builds Roads to Support Chinese and Korean People's Troops
    In order to shorten the rear transportation routes for our Volunteer Army's operations, a certain brigade of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea Volunteer Highway Engineering Corps, cooperating with the Korean Road Brigade, overcame freezing weather and managed to build a highway through a mountain range, which people thought would take two months to complete, in just half a month, shortening the transportation line by dozens of kilometers. During the project, the team members all said: "We must quickly build the highway so that our volunteer troops, trucks, artillery vehicles, and tanks can quickly move to the front line and defeat the American aggressors." Most of the team members worked in the cold wind, their shoes were broken, and their hands were chapped by the wind, but no one complained. They all unanimously expressed their determination to quickly build the highway to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in their operations. (Wang Qing)

    中朝人民抗美援朝志愿工程队积极开山修建公路支援中朝人民部队
    中国人民抗美援朝志愿公路工程总队某大队，为了缩短我志愿军作战后方运输路线，全体队员配合朝鲜道路大队在冰天雪地中，将人们认为两个月不能打通的全长数公里的某山岭，仅用半月的时间，突击修成公路，缩短运输线数十公里。在工程进行中，队员们都说：“我们一定要迅速地把公路修好，让我们的志愿部队、汽车、炮车和坦克很快地开往前线，打垮美国侵略者。”大多数的队员在寒风中工作，鞋子破了，手被风吹裂了，然而没有人叫苦，都一致坚决表示要将公路迅速修好，以支持朝鲜人民军与我国人民志愿军作战。	（王清）
