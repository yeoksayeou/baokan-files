Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th. The case of arson committed by Kuomintang special agents in Lingling County, Hunan Province, has been solved by the local People's Public Security organs with the assistance of the broad masses of the people. The chief culprits, Zhang Jingxing, Wang Yangwu, Ouyang Shaotang, Zhou Jing (female), Qu Zhongheng, Tang Yuqing, and twenty-two other bandits, were sentenced to death after a public trial on the 7th of this month, and executed by shooting after approval by the higher-level People's Government.

　　Bandit Zhang Jingxing once served as the secretary of the Kuomintang County Party Department and was a leading member of the bandit "Hunan-Guangxi-Guangdong-Guizhou People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense and National Salvation Army." Bandit Wang Yangwu once served as the director of the County Three Youth League, and other bandits such as Ouyang Shaotang and Zhou Jing were important members of the local Kuomintang and Three Youth League. As early as January 19th of this year, Bandit Zhang convened the bandits at Chaoyang Rock, west of Lingling County, to secretly discuss the arson plan to poison the people, and sent bandits Tang Songbai and Wang Shilai to procure arson supplies. On February 19th, the day before the Lantern Festival, Bandit Zhang again convened the bandits at the same location, announcing that after the success of this arson, the Kuomintang's special agency in Hong Kong would provide a heavy reward. Bandit Zhang also decided that on the Lantern Festival, the bandits would be divided into two groups to set fires in designated areas. The first group would be led by Bandit Wang Yangwu, and the second group would be led by Bandit Zhang Jingxing. On February 20th, while the masses were holding demonstrations in support of resisting America and aiding Korea, the bandits carried out large-scale arson, causing a major disaster in the county.

　　When the news of the arrest of this group of bandits spread, the residents of the entire city were overjoyed. When the bandits were escorted to the execution ground passing through the streets, the masses on both sides gnashed their teeth, pointed fingers at the bandits, and bitterly denounced them.

　　After the special agent arson incident occurred, the Lingling County People's Government immediately allocated grain for emergency relief to the poor victims, and sent the injured to hospitals for treatment. People from all walks of life in the county also donated grain and cash to help the victims. The Hunan Provincial People's Government specially sent a慰问团 [comfort group] to the county to express condolences to the victims and allocated 200,000 catties of rice as relief funds. The affected residents, with the assistance of the People's Government, are now starting to rebuild their homes. They have all firmly expressed their determination to strengthen the organization, raise vigilance, and resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements.

  　湖南零陵县纵火特务伏法
    该城居民顿足切齿手指匪犯痛骂
    决加强防特组织肃清反革命分子
    【新华社长沙十日电】湖南省零陵县城国民党特务纵火案，业经当地人民公安机关在广大人民群众协助下破案。首犯张景星、王养吾、欧阳绍唐、周静（女）、屈仲衡、唐玉清等二十二名匪徒已于本月七日经公审被判死刑，并经上级人民政府批准后枪决。
    张匪景星曾任国民党县党部书记长，系匪“湘桂粤黔人民反共自卫救国军”的首要分子。王匪养吾曾任县三青团干事长，其他匪犯如欧阳绍唐、周静等匪均为当地国民党、三青团的重要分子。早在本年一月十九日，张匪即召集各匪犯在零陵县城河西的朝阳岩秘密开会，商量毒害人民的纵火计划，并派匪徒唐松柏、王诗来两人置办纵火用品。元宵节前一天即二月十九日，张匪再度召集匪徒于原地开会，宣布这次纵火成功后，国民党在香港的特务机关将有重赏。张匪并决定于元宵节分两组按指定地区放火，第一组由王匪养吾率领，第二组由张匪景星率领。二月二十日，匪徒们乘群众举行抗美援朝示威游行之际，即大肆纵火，酿成该县巨灾。
    当这批匪徒被捕的消息传出后，全城居民欢欣异常。当匪犯被押往刑场路经大街时，两旁群众莫不顿足切齿，手指匪犯痛骂不已。
    特务纵火事件发生后，零陵县人民政府当即拨粮急赈贫苦灾民，并将受伤者送医院诊治；该县各阶层人民也纷纷捐集粮食和现款救济受害者。湖南省人民政府专门派出了慰问团赴该县慰问灾民，并拨发大米二十万斤作救济费。现受灾居民在人民政府扶助下正着手重建家园。他们都坚决表示要加强组织，提高警惕，坚决肃清反革命分子。
