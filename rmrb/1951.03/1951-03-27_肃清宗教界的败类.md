A short commentary:

　　The Gu Ren'en incident in Qingdao has educated the broad masses of religious believers, making everyone realize once again that within the religious community, there are indeed some people who, wearing the cloak of religion, serve as tools of aggression for imperialism, especially American imperialism. This is a disgrace to the religious world.

　　Since August of last year, the broad masses of patriotic Christians have put forward a platform for reform based on self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, determined to sever all ties with imperialism. The imperialists, especially American imperialists and their lackeys, who have always used the church as a tool of aggression, naturally would not be reconciled to this. They tried every despicable means to undermine this patriotic movement. Gu Ren'en was carrying out this destructive activity under the instructions of his masters.

　　Gu Ren'en put on a "compassionate" face, using "exorcism and healing" as a means to deceive the masses everywhere, taking the opportunity to conduct reactionary propaganda. He slandered the People's Government as "mountains, big and small, obstructing us," attempting to provoke the relationship between Christians and the People's Government. He defended the American imperialist aggression against Korea, even praising the American beast army invading Korea as "heavenly soldiers and generals," and falsely accusing the Korean people, who heroically sacrificed themselves to defend world peace, as "having sinned in their previous life."

　　Gu Ren'en's reactionary activities and his nonsense did not deceive the patriotic Christians and the people of Qingdao. They rose up to expose this dreg in Christianity and demanded that the government severely punish him. The local People's Government will certainly accept this just demand of the people and make appropriate arrangements.

　　Christians across the country will become more vigilant because of the Gu Ren'en incident, further exposing all the reactionary elements hiding in the church who serve imperialism, in order to maintain the purity of religion and thoroughly realize the program of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

### 肃清宗教界的败类

　　肃清宗教界的败类
    青岛市顾仁恩事件教育了广大的宗教信徒，使大家再一次地认识到：在宗教界中，确实还有些人，披着宗教的外衣，为帝国主义特别是美帝国主义作侵略工具。这是宗教界的耻辱。
    从去年八月起，广大爱国的基督教徒提出了自治、自养、自传的革新行动纲领，决心斩断与帝国主义的一切联系。一向利用教会作侵略工具的帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者和它们的走卒，自然不会甘心，他们想尽一切卑鄙的办法，企图破坏这个爱国运动。顾仁恩正是受他主子的指使来进行这个破坏活动的。
    顾仁恩装出一副“慈悲”的面孔，以“赶鬼治病”作为手段，到处欺骗群众，乘机进行反动宣传。他诽谤人民政府是“阻碍我们的大山小山”，企图以此挑拨基督教徒与人民政府的关系。他为美帝国主义侵略朝鲜作辩护，竟把侵朝美国兽军誉为“天兵天将”，并诬蔑为保卫世界和平而英勇牺牲的朝鲜人民为“前生有罪”。
    顾仁恩的反动活动和他的胡说八道，并没有能瞒住爱国的基督教徒和青岛市人民。他们起来检举了这个基督教中的败类，并要求政府予以严厉惩办。对于人民的这一正义要求，当地人民政府必然会予以接受，并作恰当的处理。
    全国各地的基督教徒将会因顾仁恩事件而进一步警惕起来，进一步揭露隐藏在教会中的一切为帝国主义服务的反动分子，以保持宗教的纯洁，彻底实现三自革新运动的纲领。
