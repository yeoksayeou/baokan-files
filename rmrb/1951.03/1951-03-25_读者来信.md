　　Reader's Letters
　　Do Not Distort the Image of the People
Comrade Editor:
　　During the Spring Festival of 1951, many cities and rural areas in Hebei Province carried out literary and artistic propaganda activities. Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Shexian and Wu'an counties also held "Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Competitions." In Shijiazhuang alone, more than 40 amateur literary and artistic groups performed 81 programs in 21 days. In various artistic performances, they were closely linked to the great political task of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea." Of the 81 programs in the Shijiazhuang Literary and Artistic Competition, more than 70 were about "Resisting America and Aiding Korea"; of the 25 programs performed in the Shexian Village Drama Troupe's Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Competition, 17 were about "Resisting America and Aiding Korea." This proves that the propaganda of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" has penetrated into factories and rural areas and is reflected through literary and artistic forms. However, in the performed "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" programs, in addition to the fact that most of them were not based on actual life but were adapted from news in newspapers, thus appearing empty and sloganized, the biggest problem was the distortion of the image of the people.
　　In the literary and artistic propaganda of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea," it is not only necessary to expose the essence of American imperialist aggression, but also to show the greatness, solemnity, and irresistibility of our nation and the strength of the people. When dressing up and playing the role of the Chinese people, the first requirement should be to show the brave, hardworking, and healthy essence of the Chinese people. However, some troupes did not do this. In the Shijiazhuang Literary and Artistic Competition, there was a program called "Attending a Fair," in which an old man and an old woman sang "Resisting America and Aiding Korea." The old man was hunchbacked, with a face full of black charcoal and wrinkles, and a few cotton beards were stuck on him. The old woman was also dressed very dirty. It was really uncomfortable to see such two people singing "Resisting America and Aiding Korea." Some troupes performed a double act, singing "Supporting Korea," but dressed up as silly boys with "sky-piercing" braids and painted faces. There was a float performing "Resisting America and Aiding Korea and Sending Public Grain." Although the float was not carrying "wives" but public grain, the people pushing and pulling the cart were still ugly old women and silly boys. This is really an insult to our brave, hardworking, and healthy people who have a high degree of enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea!
　　"Do not distort the image of the people!" This slogan has been put forward long ago, but the phenomenon of seriously distorting the image of the people still exists in some areas. It is hoped that the literary and artistic leading organs in various places will pay attention to this issue.

　　Also Discussing Opinions on Cartoon Work
Comrade Editor:
　　In the 91st issue of "People's Literature and Art," Comrade Yu Zhongyi provided cartoonists with the creative content that should be valued at present. Comrade Yu's suggestion is very good.
　　The Soviet "Crocodile" magazine used to have many readers who were not good at painting provide the editors with the artistic ideas they had in mind. The editors would then find cartoonists to draw them. In this way, many good works were also produced.
　　I think we must also have many readers who often have cartoon themes in their minds, but they do not have the talent for painting, so these very good themes are also buried. If some valuable themes can be provided to cartoonists for reference, perhaps more good works will be produced.
　　In addition, I think that comrades engaged in cartoon work should strictly demand themselves, constantly improve their political level, and study current affairs in many aspects. They should be able to discover themes from various political and current affairs issues and create a large number of works with different content.

    不要歪曲人民的形象编辑同志：
    一九五一年春节中，河北省有许多城市和农村，都开展了文艺宣传活动，石家庄市、保定市、以及涉县、武安等县，还举行了“春节文艺竞赛”。只石家庄一市，就有四十多业余文艺团体在二十一天中，演出了八十一个节目。在各种艺术的表演中，都紧紧结合着“抗美援朝”的伟大政治任务。石家庄市文艺竞赛中的八十一个节目，有七十多个是“抗美援朝”的内容；涉县村剧团春节文艺竞赛中演出的二十五个节目，十七个是“抗美援朝”的内容。这证明“抗美援朝”宣传已深入到工厂、农村，并通过文艺形式反映出来了。但是，在演出的“抗美援朝”节目中，除去大多数不是从实际生活出发，而是改编的报纸上的新闻，因而显得空洞、口号化外，一个最大的问题，便是歪曲了人民形象。
    在“抗美援朝”文艺宣传中，不但要揭露美帝国主义侵略的本质，还要表现出我们民族的伟大、庄严和人民力量的不可抗拒。在化装扮演中国人民角色时，应该首先要求表现中国人民勇敢、勤劳、健康的本质。可是，有的剧团不是这样。石家庄市文艺竞赛中，有个“赶会”的节目，一个老头和一个老婆，对口唱“抗美援朝”，老头子弓腰驼背，满脸黑炭和皱纹，用棉花粘了几块胡子，老婆子也打扮的十分肮脏，这样的两个人唱“抗美援朝”，使人觉得实在不舒服。有的剧团演双簧，口里唱的是“支援朝鲜”，但却装成傻小子，梳着“冲天”辫，打着三花脸。有个表演“抗美援朝送公粮”的花车，花车上虽不是坐的“媳妇”而是公粮，但推车的，拉车的还是丑婆子和傻小子，这实在是对我们那勇敢、勤劳、健康，怀有高度抗美援朝热情的人民的一个侮辱！
    “不要歪曲人民形象！”这个口号是早已提出了，但有的地区还存在着严重地歪曲人民形象的现象，希望各地文艺领导机关，对这个问题注意。

    也谈对漫画工作的意见编辑同志：
    《人民文艺》第九十一期上，于中义同志给漫画工作者提供了当前应该被重视的创作内容。于同志的这个建议是很好的。
    苏联的《鳄鱼画报》，曾经有许多不善于绘画的读者，把自己想到的画意提供给编者。编者再找漫画家代画。这样也产生出了不少好的作品。
    我想我们一定也有许多读者，他们脑子里时常会涌现出漫画的题材来，只是没有绘画才能，因而这些很好的题材也被埋没了。假如能够把一些宝贵的题材提供给漫画家作参考，也许会有更多的好作品产生出来。
    此外我以为从事漫画工作的同志，应当严格地要求自己，不断地提高政治水平，多方面地学习时事。能够从各种不同的政治、时事问题中发掘题材，大量地创作出各种不同内容的作品来。
