In order to implement the Trade Union Law and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the working class under the New Democratic regime, the Guangzhou Municipal Labor Bureau conducted a survey last month on the study and implementation of the Trade Union Law by the administrative aspects and capitalists of various public and private factories and enterprises, as well as the trade unions, after the promulgation and implementation of the Trade Union Law. According to preliminary and incomplete understanding, the administrative aspects of public factories and enterprises generally read the Trade Union Law but did not seriously discuss and study it, while the grassroots trade unions generally studied it better. In private factories and enterprises, the trade unions also studied the Trade Union Law better than the capitalists. Trade union cadres in the industrial sector have generally undergone learning, and grassroots trade union cadres in major industries and large factories have generally undergone learning. Capitalists have also studied, but not as actively as workers. Some trade union cadres and capitalists have only read it once or heard a report, and some small and medium-sized factories have not even studied it, and some do not even know the Trade Union Law. Therefore, whether it is trade union cadres, administrative cadres, or capitalists, apart from a few who have a more correct understanding of the Trade Union Law, many do not fully understand its basic spirit and specific content, as well as their own rights and obligations. The concept of acting in accordance with the regulations has not been fully established. Some capitalists have incorrect perceptions, believing that the Trade Union Law is purely to protect the interests of the working class, which is beneficial to workers but detrimental to capitalists; or when implementing the Trade Union Law, they believe that in addition to paying trade union dues and providing the trade union with necessary equipment and office space, other issues have nothing to do with them. Some trade union cadres believe that the implementation of the Trade Union Law mainly relies on the government, and any problems should be resolved by the Labor Bureau's orders. The administrative aspects of public factories and enterprises are generally not active and conscious enough in implementing the Trade Union Law.

Facts show that wherever trade unions, administration, and capitalists attach importance to the study of the Trade Union Law, have a correct understanding of the Trade Union Law, and the masses of employees master the Trade Union Law, the Trade Union Law is well implemented, making public-private and labor-capital relations normal, and conducive to the development of production. For example, in the Daguan Matchbox Technology Factory, 90% of the workers are illiterate. The grassroots trade union cadres wrote the Trade Union Law条 by 条 on the blackboard to educate the workers, and the capitalists also bought the Trade Union Law to study. As a result of the implementation of the law by both parties, production increased (before liberation, the average daily output of matchboxes was 230,000 to 250,000, and now it is about 300,000, an increase of more than 50,000 per day), and raw materials were saved, which directly increased the income of the capitalists. Therefore, although the factory only has 69 employees, the capitalist not only provides the grassroots trade union with the necessary equipment, but also built a new house for the trade union to work in, so that the trade union work can be better developed (Article 20 of the Trade Union Law stipulates that all factories with more than 100 people... the administration or the capitalists shall provide the grassroots committee of the trade union with the necessary houses and equipment free of charge as the office space of the grassroots committee of the trade union...). After the Qiaoming Match Factory implemented the Trade Union Law, it also increased production and saved raw materials. Before liberation, the factory produced more than 3,000 cases of matches per month, and now it produces more than 4,000 cases. When employees occupy production time for meetings due to emergencies, they automatically extend their working hours to compensate in order to take care of production. Xingguang, Huaguang and other match factories also implement well.

The dyeing and finishing industry is poorly implemented. For example, the capitalists of the Fuxing Factory not only do not pay attention to the study of the Trade Union Law and do not implement the Trade Union Law, but also intend to undermine the trade union organization and divide the unity among employees. The capitalists threatened the workers and said: "If you join the trade union, you will know you're dead when the Kuomintang returns." Workers and activists who participated in trade union organizations and participated in learning were not provided with supper when working night shifts. Since October 13 last year, the factory has been in arrears with workers' wages, clearing wages or borrowing salaries for workers who have not joined the trade union, and deliberately owing salaries or borrowing less salaries for workers who have joined the trade union, using various methods to打击积极 workers, lure backward workers, and divide and undermine trade union organizations.

In terms of public factories, the administration of the Huangpu Shipyard said: The superior did not stipulate that trade union funds can be reimbursed, so they refused to pay trade union funds. After the trade union urged many times, they borrowed 8 million yuan. The administration of the Sanitation Committee affiliated to the Municipal Health Bureau did not pay the full amount of trade union funds in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law (only 1.5% of the total wage), believing that the association had little funding and was not a profit-making enterprise, so 0.5% of it had to be approved by the superior and allocated funds before it could be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law.

### 广州大部公私营企业  未认真执行工会法

　　广州大部公私营企业
    未认真执行工会法
    广州市劳动局为贯彻执行工会法，保护工人阶级在新民主主义政权下的合法权益，曾于上月进行了解工会法公布施行后、各公私营工厂企业的行政方面和资方及工会对工会法的学习与执行情况。据初步的不完全的了解，公营工厂企业的行政方面，一般是读过工会法，但未认真讨论研究，基层工会则一般学习得较好。私营工厂企业中的资方与基层工会对工会法的学习，亦是工会比资方好。产业工会干部已普遍进行学习，各主要行业及大工厂基层工会干部一般已进行学习，资方亦有学习，但不及工人积极。部分工会干部与资方仅看过一遍或听过一次报告，中小工厂有的还没有学习过，甚至也有不知工会法的。因此，不管是工会干部、行政干部或资方，除部分对工会法有较正确认识外，很多对其基本精神与具体内容及自己的权利与义务都了解不够，照章办事的观点还未完全建立起来，部分资方存在不正确的认识，认为工会法是单纯保障工人阶级的利益，对工人有利，资方不利；或执行工会法时，认为除了缴交工会经费及供给工会必要设备、办公地方等外，其他问题与自己无关。某些工会干部则有认为工会法的执行，主要是靠政府，有事就要劳动局命令解决。公营工厂企业行政方面，一般是主动地和自觉地执行工会法不够。
    事实说明，凡工会、行政、资方对工会法学习重视，对工会法有正确认识，职工群众掌握了工会法，工会法便执行得好，使公私和劳资关系正常，且有利于生产向前发展。如大光火柴盒技厂，工人百分之九十是文盲，基层工会干部将工会法逐条写在黑板上教育工人，资方也买了工会法回来学习。双方依法执行结果，生产增加（解放前平均每天产火柴盒二十三万至二十五万个，现约产三十万个，每天增产五万个以上），原料节省，直接增加了资方的收入。因此，该厂虽然职工仅六十九人，资方不但供给基层工会必需设备，且另建了一所新房子给工会办公，使工会工作能更好展开（工会法第二十条规定，凡一百人以上工厂……行政或资方应免费供给工会基层委员会以必要的房屋及设备，作为工会基层委员会办公处所……）。巧明火柴厂执行工会法后，同样也增加了生产量，节省了原料。解放前该厂每月产火柴三千余笠，现在生产四千笠以上，职工因紧急事情占用生产时间开会时，为了照顾生产，自动将下班时间延长作为弥补。执行得好的还有星光、华光等火柴厂。
    染整业则执行得较差，如复兴厂资方不但对工会法的学习不重视和不执行工会法，而且意图破坏工会组织，分化职工间的团结。资方恐吓工人说：“你参加工会呀，国民党返来你就知道死”。参加工会组织及参加学习的工人及积极分子，开夜工时，不供给夜餐。该厂自去年十月十三日起，积欠工人工资，对未参加工会的工人清发工资或借薪，对参加工会的工人则故意欠薪不借或少借薪，用种种方法来打击积极工人，利诱落后工人，分化和破坏工会组织。
    在公营工厂方面，黄埔造船厂行政方面说：上级没有规定工会经费可以报销，因而不肯缴交工会经费，经工会多次催缴，才借了八百万元。市卫生局所属清洁委员会行政方面不按工会法规定缴足工会经费（只给工资总额百分之一·五），认为该会经费少，又不是赚钱的企业，故其中的百分之○·五要待上级批准，拨来经费后才能按工会法规定执行。
