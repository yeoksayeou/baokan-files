Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: The situation of British imperialism in Malaya is deteriorating. British imperialism has suffered very serious casualties in its war against the Malayan National Liberation Army. According to an estimate by a reporter for the American Christian Science Monitor last December, British casualties are more than one-third higher than those of the Malayan National Liberation Army.

The financial situation of the British colonial government in Malaya is also deteriorating. The so-called "pacification expenses," which only cover police expenses, etc., increased significantly last year compared to the previous two years. According to the Malayan Federation Assistant Secretary, this expenditure was 24 million Malayan dollars in 1948 (Malayan currency, one Malayan dollar equals two shillings and four pence), 85 million Malayan dollars in 1949, and increased to 120 million Malayan dollars in 1950, with a fiscal deficit of 73 million Malayan dollars that year. According to an estimate by Taylor, the Acting Financial Secretary of Malaya, at the Malayan Legislative Council on November 21st last year, the total "pacification expenditure" in 1951 will reach 200 million Malayan dollars, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the total federal expenditure.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: British imperialism is making Australia and New Zealand jointly participate in the bloody suppression of the Malayan People's Liberation Movement. When the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held in London from January 4th to 12th this year, Attlee and Bevin held behind-the-scenes negotiations with Australian Prime Minister Menzies and New Zealand Prime Minister Holland on this matter. Menzies and Holland agreed to "take over a large part of the British army's tasks in Malaya" and promised to transport troops, ammunition, and some aircraft to Malaya. They would also bear the main financial expenses required for the Malayan war. However, Menzies stated that because Australia's participation in the Korean War had already caused dissatisfaction among the Australian people, and in view of the serious losses suffered by the British army in Malaya, the Australian government could not draw the main part of its troops from white troops to send to Malaya, but could only draw a part from the indigenous troops, from the Australian troops in Australian New Guinea - Papua. Attlee and Bevin had to agree to this opinion, but insisted that the officers in these indigenous troops should be supplemented by British personnel.

British imperialism's plan to transfer the burden of the war against the Malayan people to the shoulders of the British Commonwealth countries has been premeditated for a long time. At the British Commonwealth Conference held in Sydney in May last year, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, reached an agreement with Australian Prime Minister Menzies to have Australia send a squadron of bomber planes to Malaya to assist the British army in the war. At that time, mass rallies and demonstrations were held in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. They shouted: "Don't let a gun or a penny of Australia be used to slaughter the Malayan people!" Therefore, Menzies did not dare to carry out large-scale "aid."

According to an estimate by British Conservative Member of Parliament Commons, the combined cost of British imperialism's garrison expenses and "local pacification expenses" in Malaya is about 100 million pounds a year. It is not difficult to predict that the Australian government, which is already in a state of inflation, will suddenly increase its 700 million Australian pound budget by 100 million pounds for the Malayan war, whether or not New Zealand shares it, inevitably causing terrible consequences for the national economy. At the same time, Menzies' measure of further driving the people into a vile war will inevitably be met with more intense opposition from the Australian people.

　　在马来亚进行的不义战争
    使英国处境日益恶化     
    正迫使澳、新共同镇压马来亚人民
    【新华社四日讯】英帝国主义在马来亚的处境日益恶化。英帝国主义在对马来亚民族解放军作战中，伤亡非常严重。据去年十二月美国基督教科学箴言报载该报记者的估计，英军伤亡数比马来亚民族解放军的伤亡数多三分之一以上。
    马来亚英国殖民政府的财政情况也是每况愈下。仅支付警察经费等等的所谓“戡乱开销”一项，去年一年比前两年增加了很多。据马来亚联合邦辅政司公布，这一项开支一九四八年为二千四百万叻元（马来亚币，一叻元合二先令四辨士），一九四九年为八千五百万叻元，一九五○年即增至一亿二千万叻元，该年财政赤字达七千三百万叻元。据马来亚代理财政司司长泰勒去年十一月二十一日在马来亚立法会议上估计，一九五一年，“戡乱总开销”将达两亿叻元，占联邦总支出的百分之六十弱。
    【新华社四日讯】英帝国主义正使澳大利亚和新西兰共同参加对马来亚人民解放运动的血腥镇压。当今年一月四日至十二日不列颠联邦各国在伦敦举行联邦总理会议时，艾德礼和贝文曾与澳大利亚总理孟席斯及新西兰总理赫兰，就此事举行幕后谈判。孟席斯和赫兰同意“接替英军在马来亚的一大部分任务”，答应运送军队、弹药和若干飞机至马来亚。马来亚战争所需要的主要财政开支也由他们负担。不过孟席斯曾声明：由于澳大利亚的参加朝鲜战争已引起澳大利亚人民的不满，同时鉴于英军在马来亚受到严重的损失，澳大利亚政府不能从白种人的军队中抽调主要部分派往马来亚，而只能从土人部队中，从澳属新几内亚——巴布亚的澳大利亚部队中抽调一部分。艾德礼和贝文只好同意这意见，但是主张这些土人部队中的军官应由英人补充。
    英帝国主义要把反对马来亚人民的战争重担转嫁于不列颠联邦国家肩上的计划，蓄意已久。在去年五月间于悉尼举行的不列颠联邦会议上，英东南亚最高专员麦克唐纳即与澳大利亚总理孟席斯取得协议，决定由澳大利亚派一中队轰炸机队到马来亚协助英军作战。当时，悉尼、墨尔本和阿得雷德的群众曾为此举行了群众大会与示威游行。他们高喊：“不让澳大利亚的一枝枪、一个钱，用来屠杀马来亚人民！”因此孟席斯不敢进行大规模“援助”。
    据英保守党议员甘门斯估计：英帝国主义在马来亚的驻军费与“地方戡乱费”合起来，一年约需一亿英镑。不难预料，现已处于通货膨胀情况中的澳大利亚政府，在今年七亿澳镑的预算上突然增加一亿英镑的马来亚战费，不论新西兰分担与否，不可避免地要造成国民经济上的可怕后果。同时，孟席斯把人民进一步驱向卑污战争的这一措施，也必然会遭到澳大利亚人民更激烈的反对。
