Since the Central People's Government's State Council promulgated the "Decision on Abolishing the Feudal Monopoly System in the Transportation Industry in Various Regions" in March 1950, and after fierce struggles by the broad working class, the feudal monopoly system in the transportation industry in 128 large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, has been basically crushed. Recently, the movement against the feudal monopoly system has expanded to all parts of the country. Cities in Northeast China such as Anshan, Fushun, Harbin, Jilin, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Siping; cities in North China such as Xinxiang, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang; cities in Central and South China such as Nanchang, Changsha, Hengyang, and Nanning; and cities in East China such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Fuzhou, have all launched struggles against feudal bosses.

Feudal bosses in the transportation industry not only monopolized the transportation business, cruelly ruled and exploited workers, and hindered the exchange of goods and the development of industry and commerce; but also spread rumors and instigated riots, endangering urban security, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. For example, the feudal boss in Sanyuan City, Shaanxi Province, killed Wang Baorong, the accountant of the transport workers' union, with knives, and stabbed Liu Guoheng, the chairman of the union, in eleven places; Xie Zicai and Wu Jingshou, special agents in Bengbu, organized riots, saying, "If you follow the Communist Party, your head will be unreliable!" Xu Zixin, a Nanchang boss, Kuomintang special agent, and leader of a reactionary gang, seized workers' wives and daughters, killed nine Communist Party members including Xiong Guohua, and provoked workers to compete for docks and kill each other. Liang Guangcheng, a local tyrant boss in Guangzhou, nicknamed "Tiger of the Wharf" and "Human Head Bird", colluded with special agent bosses since 1935, and used reactionary forces to control the Tong'an, Youde, Youheng, and Yuehai wharves, ruling and exploiting workers. When Guangzhou university students held demonstrations against hunger, civil war, and persecution on May 31, 1947, he directed special agents to brutally beat the students, causing a bloody tragedy. Zhu Guitang, a big boss in Ningbo, participated in organizations such as the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League, and served as the leader of enemy and puppet intelligence groups, the captain of the spy brigade, and the captain of the anti-traitor squad. He organized the "Twenty-Two Gang" and the "Thirty-Six Gang" on the wharf to carry out espionage work, killing eight workers including Zhang Qiaofa, and spread rumors to intimidate workers. The bosses in Hangzhou, "Five Tigers, Eight Generals, and Thirty-Six Big Men," were all special agents and gang leaders. They divided up spoils on the wharves, organized gangs, implemented feudal rule, and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

Some bosses and counter-revolutionaries infiltrated the ranks of our working class, using workers' guild ideas and backward thinking to provoke discord, disrupt transportation, and carry out despicable conspiracies such as robbery, theft, arson, and assassination. For example, the bandit gang of Fang Qingfu and others in Nanning killed more than 140 cadres, militiamen, and people, openly raped more than 40 young women, and threw more than 20 children into ponds to drown them; when our army launched encirclement and suppression, they lurked in the city and mingled with the transport workers. Ni Jinggui, a landlord who had fled and was struggled against in Shenyang, infiltrated the union and was elected as a member. He secretly colluded with and incited Wang Tiejun and Zhang Maoren (landlords) to carry out reactionary activities, prevent the union's organizational review work, and conspire to usurp the union leadership. Chen Shaowu and Liu Yongkun, special agents sent by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from the Military Statistics Bureau in Bengbu, developed a special agent organization among the transport workers.

In the past, some cities did not have a sufficient understanding of these feudal remnants, did not pay attention to this work, and did not severely suppress these bosses and counter-revolutionaries. As a result, it caused dissatisfaction and concerns among the workers, and fueled the arrogance of feudal bosses and counter-revolutionaries. Some bosses and counter-revolutionaries called themselves "veterans of three dynasties," and they pointed at the workers and said, "Just wait and see, at most we'll stay in the Public Security Bureau for a few days!"

The people's governments in various places accepted the accusations, reports, and demands of the masses, and successively arrested these bosses, local tyrants, and counter-revolutionaries, and then held accusation meetings and public trial meetings. The masses unanimously demanded that they be severely punished. Some local people's courts have sentenced them to death or imprisonment according to the charges against these bosses.

In cities where these feudal remnants have been resolutely eliminated, workers will actively expose counter-revolutionaries, and the workers' labor enthusiasm will be quickly improved. After Hangzhou executed the boss "Three Tigers" who organized the anti-Communist Jiangnan Salvation Army, the workers automatically gathered in teams to parade and celebrate the victory; after Guangzhou executed "Tiger of the Wharf" Liang Guangcheng, the workers set off firecrackers and drank celebratory wine as if it were the New Year, expressing their congratulations; after Nanchang shot three local tyrant bosses, the workers said, "A five-thousand-year-old tree has blossomed, and five hundred million people have become masters of their own house."

The workers who have achieved victory have all improved their production enthusiasm and established new labor attitudes; some cities have also launched labor competitions, using practical actions to participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homeland.

Currently, 27 medium and small cities across the country are carrying out this anti-feudal struggle; 18 cities have undergone this struggle, but not thoroughly; and 68 cities have not yet carried out this work. Cities that have not completely abolished feudal bosses should abolish them thoroughly immediately. In cities that have basically abolished the feudal monopoly system, it is still necessary to conduct one or several reviews of the transport workers' union organization, and resolutely and unhesitatingly cleanse the bosses, contractors, foremen, landlords, leaders of secret societies, and special agents who have infiltrated and been pulled into the union organization.

　　各地搬运工人进行激烈斗争
    基本打垮封建把持制度
    暗藏工人中的特务开始被检举出来
    得到胜利后的工人劳动积极性提高
    自从一九五○年三月中央人民政府政务院公布“废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度”的决定以后，经过广大工人阶级的激烈斗争，北京、天津、沈阳、武汉、南京、重庆、广州等一百二十八个大、中城市搬运事业中的封建把持制度基本上已摧垮了。近来，反对封建把持制度的运动，已扩展到全国各地。东北的鞍山、抚顺、哈尔滨、吉林、长春、齐齐哈尔、四平，华北的新乡、太原、石家庄，中南的南昌、长沙、衡阳、南宁，华东的温州、宁波、福州等城市，都先后开展了反封建把头的斗争。
    搬运事业中的封建把头，不但垄断着搬运事业，残酷地统治剥削工人，阻碍物资交流和工商业的发展；而且造谣暴乱，危害城市治安，进行反革命活动。如陕西省三原市的封建把头，乱刀杀死了搬运工会会计王保荣，刀刺工会主席刘国恒十一处；蚌埠特务谢子才、吴景寿组织暴乱，说：“跟共产党走，头就靠不住了！”南昌把头、国民党特务、反动帮会头子徐自新，霸占工人妻女，杀害熊国华等九个共产党员，并挑拨工人争夺码头，互相砍杀。广州市恶霸把头梁广成、绰号“码头之虎”“人头鸟”，从一九三五年起就勾结特务头子，利用反动势力把持了同安、有德、有恒、粤海等码头，对工人统治、剥削。一九四七年五月三十一日广州中大学生举行反饥饿、反内战、反迫害示威游行时，他指挥特务狠毒地殴打学生，造成血腥的惨案。宁波的大把头朱桂棠，参加过国民党、三青团等组织，一直担任敌伪情报组长、谍报队长、肃奸队长等职务，在码头上组织“二十二股党”“三十六股党”作特务工作，杀害工人张桥法等八人，并散布谣言、恐吓工人。杭州的把头“五虎、八将、三十六大汉”，都是些特务分子和帮会头子，他们在码头上坐地分赃、组织帮会、实行封建统治，进行反革命活动。
    有些把头、反革命分子混入我们工人阶级队伍的内部，利用工人的行会思想和落后思想，进行挑拨离间、捣乱运输、抢劫、偷盗、放火、暗杀等卑鄙的阴谋活动。如南宁的土匪方卿甫等匪帮，曾杀害干部、民兵、群众一百四十余人，公开强奸青年妇女四十余人，将二十多个小孩子投进池塘淹死；在我军进剿时，他们就潜伏城市，混入搬运工人当中。沈阳被斗争的逃亡地主倪景贵，混入工会当选了委员，暗地拉拢煽动王铁军、张茂仁（地主）进行反动活动，阻止工会组织的审查工作，阴谋篡夺工会领导。蚌埠蒋匪帮派来军统局特务陈少五、刘永坤在搬运工人中发展特务组织。
    过去，有些城市由于对这些封建残余势力认识不足，没有重视这个工作，对这帮把头、反革命分子没有严厉的镇压。因此，造成了工人群众的不满和顾虑，助长了封建把头和反革命分子的气焰。有些把头和反革命分子自称“三朝元老”，他们指着工人说：“走着看吧，最多公安局住几天！”
    各地人民政府接受群众的控诉、检举和要求，先后把这些把头、恶霸、反革命分子逮捕了起来，又开了控诉大会和公审大会。群众一致要求严惩他们。有些地方人民法院已根据这些把头的罪状，依法判处他们以死刑或徒刑。
    凡是坚决肃清了这些封建残余势力的城市，工人就会积极检举反革命分子，工人的劳动情绪就会很快提高。杭州处决组织反共江南救国军的把头“三虎”以后，工人们自动集队游行，庆祝胜利；广州处决“码头之虎”梁广成之后，工人们像过新年一样放爆竹、痛饮喜酒，表示祝贺；南昌枪毙了三个恶霸把头之后，工人们说：“ 五千年古树开了花，五万万人民当了家。”
    得到胜利后的工人，生产积极性都提高了，树立了新的劳动态度；有些城市还展开了劳动竞赛，用实际行动来参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    目前，全国有二十七个中、小城市正在进行这种反封建斗争；有十八个城市虽然经过了这种斗争，但不彻底；有六十八个城市还没有进行这个工作。没有彻底废除封建把头的城市，应即彻底予以废除。在基本上已废除封建把持制度的城市，则还须进行一次或者好几次的搬运工会组织的审查工作，把混进、拉进工会组织内的把头、包工头、脚行头、地主、会道门头子、特务分子，坚决地毫不犹豫地从工会组织内清洗出去。
