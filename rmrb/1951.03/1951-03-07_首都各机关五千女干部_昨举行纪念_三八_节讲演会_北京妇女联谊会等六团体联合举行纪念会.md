　　Five Thousand Female Cadres from Capital Organs
    Held Lecture Meeting Yesterday to Commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day.
    Beijing Women's Federation and Six Other Groups Jointly Held Commemorative Meeting.
    [Reported by this newspaper] Five thousand female cadres from central, North China, and Beijing municipal-level organs held a lecture meeting at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall at 1:00 PM on the 6th to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day. They invited Shuai Mengqi, Minister of the Organization Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Hu Sheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Li Lilian, Deputy Minister of the Women and Children Welfare Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and representative of the delegation that recently attended the Berlin meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation, to speak. Shuai Mengqi's speech first described the great contributions of Chinese women in the revolutionary movement, as well as the progress of all female cadres in various aspects in the two years since the liberation of the capital. She pointed out that the construction of the new China is developing rapidly, and a large number of construction talents are needed, but the quantity and quality of the current female cadres are still far behind the actual needs. She said that some female cadres still have narrow-minded and uneasy thoughts about their work, which seriously hinders their progress. She called on all female cadres to step up their study of Marxist-Leninist theory, Mao Zedong Thought and policies and laws, and to learn technology and master their business. Hu Sheng explained from the international and domestic situation that the society of the motherland has undergone fundamental changes, and this is because we have a superior system of people's democratic dictatorship. He called on all female cadres to carry out patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the masses during the commemoration of "March 8th" Women's Day, and to strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Li Lilian conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the Berlin meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation. She also showed everyone the banner embroidered with "Honor belongs to the women and mothers of China" given to Chinese women by the West German Women's Federation. The audience responded with warm applause. (Prepared by the "March 8th" Women's Day Preparatory Committee)
    [Another report] The Beijing Women's Federation, the Women's Association of Industry and Commerce, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Temperance Union, and the Women's Associations of Peking University and Normal University, six women's groups, held a joint commemorative meeting for "March 8th" International Women's Day at the Democratic Theater at 1:30 PM on the 6th. A total of more than 1,100 women attended the meeting. After Liu Qingyang, the executive chairman of the conference, delivered the opening speech, Shi Liang, Minister of the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, and Cao Mengjun, Minister of the Service Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke successively. Finally, a declaration was passed with collective signatures to resist America and aid Korea and oppose the United States' arming of Japan.
