　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, March 25th:
    Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, Zhang Fu, and other three delegates of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China, left Luoyang for Xi'an on the 24th. They will then travel to Lanzhou, Chongqing, Kunming, and other places to report on the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army in fighting the American invading army in Korea. Ji Bingqian and others arrived in Luoyang from Zhengzhou on the 20th and stayed in the city for four days, giving six reports to people from all walks of life, with an audience of more than 40,000 people. They were warmly welcomed and respected by people from all walks of life in the city. Many rural women from villages far from the city rode into the city on horse-drawn carts they had acquired during the land reform to listen to their speeches. Porters Kong Ji, Li Mingde, Wu Quanzhang, and others donated 1.3 million yuan in prize money they had won in patriotic savings to them. Upon hearing that the Volunteer Army lacked books and newspapers to read, the students immediately launched a book donation campaign, donating more than 3,000 books in just one day on the 23rd. Businessmen and industrialists presented the People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegates with famous local products such as monkey head mushrooms, seaweed, and pickled eggs.

    【新华社开封二十五日电】我国人民志愿军归国代表嵇炳前、李维英、张甫等三人，于二十四日由洛阳赴西安，并将转赴兰州、重庆、昆明等地，报告志愿军在朝鲜打击美国侵略军的英勇事迹。嵇炳前等系于二十日由郑州转赴洛阳，在该市逗留四日，向各界人民作了六次报告，听众达四万余人。他们受到全市各界人民的热烈欢迎和尊敬。许多离市区很远的农村妇女，都坐着在土地改革中分得的马车赶进城来听他们的讲演。搬运工人孔乩、李明德、武全章等把在爱国储蓄中获得的奖金一百三十万元献给他们。学生们听到志愿军缺少书报阅读，立刻发起了献书运动，仅二十三日一天内即捐献三千余册。工商界赠送了著名土产猴头菜、石花菜和糟蛋等给志愿军归国代表。
