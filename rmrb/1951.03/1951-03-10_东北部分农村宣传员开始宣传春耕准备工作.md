Northeast Rural Propagandists Begin to Publicize Spring Plowing Preparations

　　Under the leadership of local CCP committees, rural propagandists in some areas of Northeast China are launching spring plowing preparation publicity campaigns.

　　In Zhaotun Village, Fifth District, Zhenxian County, Liaoxi, sixteen propagandists, because the village is suitable for planting kenaf, mobilized the masses to respond to the government's call to plant more kenaf. For example, propagandist Wang Shuqing said to the masses: "Our land here is good for growing kenaf, and kenaf isn't afraid of flooding. If you grow it well, you can peel more than one hundred jin per mu. Good kenaf can be exchanged for twelve jin of sorghum per jin, and one mu can be exchanged for more than one thousand jin of sorghum, which is more cost-effective than planting one mu of sorghum. We should respond to the government's call to plant more kenaf. In this way, our people will become rich and live a good life, and the country will have industrial raw materials. It's really a win-win situation." He not only publicized it verbally but also led by example, preparing to plant one tian (qing) of kenaf. There are twenty-four households in their residential group, and after his publicity, they are preparing to plant ten tian (qing) of kenaf.

　　The Party branch of Anju Village, Eleventh District, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang, organized propagandists to study the victorious news of annihilating more than 20,000 enemies on the Korean front and the opposition to the United States rearming Japan. They then used methods such as seminars and discussions to publicize to the peasants and put forward the slogan: "The more victories on the front line, the more efforts should be made in production in the rear!" They also focused on publicity regarding trial planting, organization, and loan policies. Propagandist Yang Fa showed everyone his trial-planted soybean seeds that did not sprout, saying, "I originally thought the soybean seeds would sprout. If I hadn't tried it, it would have been terrible. Everyone must try it!" Then He Qifu's millet seeds and Yu Youfa's soybean seeds also did not sprout. Yu Youfa said to the propagandists, "Thanks to your publicity, otherwise I would have lost a qing of soybeans!" Now all 245 households in the village are trial planting and carefully selecting more than 20,000 jin of Manchurian gold soybeans. Propagandist Zhang Yingming, after studying the production policy, tried to improve the unreasonable method of his original production team's "horse-plowing" and absorbed two more households, forming a team of six horses, and made a production increase plan. The propagandists used this team as an example to publicize everywhere. Eleven of the thirty-eight teams in the village have already learned his method. In addition, the propagandists publicized the loan policy, which clarified the situation of surplus grain. More than twenty households established loan relationships for more than 10,000 jin of grain. Xu Fengshan's family lent out more than 3,000 jin of grain at an annual interest rate of four percent. Li Fu, borrowing grain, was determined to take good care of the land, saying to the propagandists, "If you hadn't publicized it, people wouldn't have dared to borrow." Because of these activities of the propagandists, Party branch secretary Xuan Jingfa happily said, "The work in Anju Village has changed!"

　　For example, Liu Yuzhang, a propagandist in Shuangquan Village, Baiyun District, Xiuyan County, Liaodong, believes that it is not enough to just shout slogans; he must lead by example while publicizing, and both aspects are indispensable. On the third day of the Lunar New Year, he found Lu Guozhen to discuss organizing a four-person work group, and on the fifth day, they went up the mountain to collect firewood, which made those who planned to "play during the first month and make noise in the second" anxious and they also went up the mountain to collect firewood. He also seized the example of the woman Guo Guilan going up the mountain to collect firewood and publicized Guo Guilan's good labor to the women. As a result, some women also organized two firewood collection groups and helped the men feed livestock, test seed germination, and do odd jobs.

　　东北部分农村宣传员开始宣传春耕准备工作
    东北有些地区的农村宣传员，在当地中共党委领导下，正展开春耕准备宣传活动。
    辽西北镇县五区赵屯村十六名宣传员，因该村适合种洋麻，就发动群众响应政府号召，多种洋麻。比如宣传员王树清向群众这样说：“咱们这里的地种洋麻爱长，洋麻这玩艺涝点也不怕。种好了一亩能剥一百多斤，好麻一斤换十二斤高粱，一亩能换一千多斤高粱，比种一亩高粱合算多了。咱们应该响应政府号召多种洋麻，这样，咱们老百姓发财致富过好日子，国家又有了工业原料，真是一举两得。”他不但嘴里宣传，还以身作则，自己准备种一天（垧）地的洋麻。他们居民组有二十四户，经他一宣传，就准备种十天（垧）地的洋麻了。
    黑龙江肇东县十一区安居村党支部，把朝鲜前线歼敌二万多胜利消息和反对美国重新武装日本的事，组织宣传员学习后，就用座谈讨论等方式向农民宣传，并提出口号：“前方胜利越多，后方生产越要加劲！”并抓紧试种、组织起来和借贷政策等进行宣传。宣传员杨发自己试的豆种没出芽，就端着给大伙看，他说：“原来我寻思豆种能出芽，若不试这一下就糟了，大家都得试一试！”接着何七福的谷种和于有发的豆种也没出芽，于有发对宣传员们说：“多亏你们宣传，若不我要扣一垧黄豆得受多大损失！”现在全村二百四十五户都试种，精选满仓金大豆两万多斤。宣传员张英明，因学习了生产政策，就想法改进自己原先生产小组马勾地的不合理办法，又吸收了两户，一共插起六个马的小组，并做了增产计划。宣传员们就拿这个小组做榜样到处宣传，全村三十八个小组已经有十一个小组学他的办法了。另外，宣传员宣传了借贷政策，使余粮的摸着了底，有二十多户建立了一万多斤粮食的借贷关系，徐凤山一家就以年利四分借出粮三千多斤。李福借着粮下决心好好侍弄地，对宣传员们说：“不叫你们宣传，人家还不敢借。”由于宣传员们这些活动，把党支部书记宣景发乐的说：“安居村的工作变样了！”
    又如，辽东岫岩县白云区双泉村宣传员刘玉章，认为自己光喊不行，得一边宣传一边带头做样子，两方面缺一不可。旧历大年初三就找鲁国珍核计组织了一个四人的伴工组，初五就上山打柴火，结果使那些打算“耍正月闹二月”的人都着了急，照样上山打柴。他又抓住妇女郭桂兰上山打柴的例子，向妇女宣传郭桂兰的好劳动，这样有些妇女也组织了两个打柴火组，并替男人喂牲口、试种发芽、干零活。
