    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has issued instructions to various localities to transform seasonal winter schools into regular peasant spare-time schools (hereinafter referred to as people's schools). To ensure that the nation has five million peasants persisting in regular spare-time study in 1951, the instructions issued on March 1st stated:
    Local leading organs, especially the education departments of provincial and county people's governments, should immediately organize forces to systematically inspect the work of winter schools and convene special meetings in a timely manner. In addition to earnestly summarizing the work of winter schools at the meeting, emphasis should be placed on mobilizing for the transformation of winter schools into people's schools, researching and determining the conditions, specific requirements, work steps, and work methods for this transformation. Education departments at all levels should grasp and implement the policy of targeting rural cadres and activists as the main participants in peasant spare-time education.
    Education departments of provincial and county people's governments should, as far as possible, convene representative conferences of study models, model teachers, model schools, and model study villages with a reward-based nature. Experience has proven that these "model award conferences" can more effectively publicize and organize mass learning, exchange experiences, and encourage enthusiasm for learning. Before and after the convening of the "model award conferences," cadres, teachers, and students should be mobilized to summarize the teaching achievements and experiences of winter schools, hold achievement exhibitions; and mobilize them to discuss and study how to transform winter schools into people's schools, and formulate teaching plans to ensure continuous year-round study, as well as covenants and systems to guarantee the realization of these plans, so that winter schools can be transformed into people's schools on the basis of full mass awareness.
    Local leading organs must pay special attention to the implementation of the Ministry of Education's 1950 instructions on carrying out peasant spare-time education, earnestly study and solve the practical difficulties of teachers, and strive to have fixed teachers in all localities.

　　中央人民政府教育部指示各地将冬学转为常年民校
    争取今年有五百万农民坚持常年业余学习
    中央人民政府教育部为使季节性的冬学转为常年农民业余学校（以下简称民校），并争取全国在一九五一年内能有五百万农民坚持常年业余学习，于三月一日发出指示称：
    各地领导机关，尤其是省、县人民政府的教育部门，应立即组织力量有计划地检查冬学工作，并适时地召开专门会议。在会议上除认真地总结冬学工作外，并应着重进行冬学转民校的动员，研究与确定冬学转民校的条件、具体要求、工作步骤与工作方法等。各级教育部门应掌握与贯彻农民业余教育以农村干部与积极分子为主要对象的方针。
    各省、县人民政府教育部门，应尽可能召开具有奖励性质的学习模范、模范教师、模范学校及学习模范村的代表会议。经验证明，通过这种“奖模会议”，可以更有效地宣传与组织群众学习，交流经验，鼓舞学习的热情。在召开“奖模会议”前后，应发动干部、教师、和学员总结冬学教学成绩、教学经验，举行成绩展览；发动他们讨论、研究如何把冬学转为民校，并订出坚持常年学习的教学计划和保证这种计划实现的公约与制度，以便使冬学在群众充分自觉的基础上转为民校。
    各地领导机关必须特别注意执行教育部一九五零年关于开展农民业余教育指示的规定，认真地研究和解决教师的实际困难问题，争取各地都有固定的教师。
