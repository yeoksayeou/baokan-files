    Chongqing People's Court Accepts Dockworker Accusations
    Special Agent and Local Tyrant Fang Xichi Publicly Executed by Firing Squad

To the Editor:

    The dockworkers of the Chongqing Transportation Company sent a letter to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, accusing Fang Xichi, the pseudo-dockworkers' union cadre, special agent, and local tyrant, of his crimes. The Chongqing Xinhua Daily forwarded this letter to the city's People's Court. After investigation, the court confirmed the accusations and arrested the special agent and local tyrant, Fang Xichi. On February 27th, the city's dockworkers were summoned to a public trial, where the court, according to law, sentenced the criminal to death and immediately executed him by firing squad. All the dockworkers in the city were extremely excited, believing that the government should have severely suppressed such heinous counter-revolutionaries long ago. For thirteen years, Fang Xichi had run rampant in the Xiangguosi area of Chongqing, exploiting and oppressing dockworkers, murdering workers, raping women, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. The workers called him "the living閻王 (Yama, the King of Hell)." Fang had participated in reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League, and had served as an executive member of the Kuomintang Chongqing Tenth District Party Headquarters and the head of the pseudo-Waterfront Protection Detachment. Before the liberation of Chongqing, he was the head of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps" detachment; after liberation, he remained unrepentant, continued to be an enemy of the people, refused to surrender, fabricated rumors to intimidate workers, and attempted to riot.

    Fang Xichi's crimes are endless. Before liberation, he murdered Xu Lide, a Communist Party member and worker at the Yu Gong Ferry Company, and harmed more than ten people including Zhang Shiming, Bao Ying, and Chen Jian. He forcibly conscripted Zhou Ziqing, Lin Yucheng, Deng Haiqing, and others as soldiers, and bullied the elderly and widowed. Ferry worker Wu Shuyun had both legs broken and an arm fractured by him, forcing him and his wife into beggary. In 1947, Fang Xichi colluded with more than 300 pseudo-police officers to create the Songshuqiao bloodbath, resulting in many deaths and injuries. In August 1948, he incited the pseudo-soldiers of the Kuomintang Army Hospital to sink ships in order to collect money. Fang Xichi insulted a female teacher at Puyi School, raped Liu Bazi's wife, and beat Liu Bazi to death. He raped Chen Shuhua and Deng Rongchen's wives.

    Fang Xichi relied on feudal forces to cruelly exploit the workers, using the name of the old union to control ships, forcibly establishing items such as "monthly donations," "membership fees," "base money," "corvée labor," "requesting meetings," and "lending at interest" to extort workers. Many workers were forced to eat vegetable scraps and bean dregs, living inhuman lives because of his extortion and blackmail. The amount of wealth, ships, and houses he seized is countless. For more than a decade, thousands of worker brothers suffered pain and torture under the tyranny of the local bully Fang Xichi, with no place to air their grievances, no place to settle their accounts, and no way to avenge their hatred. Today, the workers have stood up and become masters of their own destiny. The Chongqing People's Court accepted the workers' opinions and earnestly implemented the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" issued by Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, so that the special agent and local tyrant Fang Xichi finally received the punishment he deserved.

    重庆人民法院接受驳运船工人检举
    特务恶霸方熙池当众枪决编辑同志：
    重庆市搬运公司驳运船工人写信给重庆新华日报，控诉伪驳运船工会干事、特务恶霸方熙池的罪行。重庆新华日报即将此信转该市人民法院，市法院经过调查属实，即将特务恶霸罪犯方熙池逮捕，并于二月二十七日召集全市驳运船工举行公审大会，依法判处该犯死刑，当场执行枪决。全市驳运工人莫不兴奋异常，认为对这样罪大恶极的反革命分子，政府早就应该给以严厉镇压。方熙池十三年来，横行重庆香国寺一带，剥削压迫驳运工人，杀害工人，奸淫妇女，无恶不作，工人们都叫他“活阎王”。方犯曾参加国民党、三青团等反动组织，曾任国民党重庆第十区党部执行委员、伪水上防护分团团长。重庆解放前夕，任“反共救国团”分团团长；解放后，仍执迷不悟，继续与人民为敌，拒不自首，反制造谣言威吓工人，并企图暴动。
    方熙池的罪恶是说不完的。在解放前他曾经杀害过共产党员渝工轮渡公司工人许立德，残害张世明、鲍英、陈剑等十余人。强拉周子清、林玉成、邓海清等人当壮丁，欺压孤寡。渡船工人吴树云被他打坏两腿，打断手臂，夫妇被迫流为乞丐。一九四七年方熙池曾勾结伪警察三百多人，制造松树桥血案，死伤多人。一九四八年八月又唆使国民党陆军医院伪军打沉船只，借此敛财。方熙池曾侮辱普益学校女教师，奸污刘疤子妻子，并打死刘疤子。强奸陈树华及邓荣臣的妻子。
    方熙池凭借封建势力对工人进行凶残的剥削，利用旧工会名义控制船只，强立“月捐”、“会费”、“底金”、“劳役”、“请会”、“放息”等名目来勒索工人。很多工人因受他的勒索、敲诈，自己吃菜屑、豆渣，过着非人生活。他霸占的财物、船只、房屋更不知其数。十数年来，数千工人兄弟在恶霸方熙池的淫威下，受尽痛苦与折磨，有冤无处伸，有账无处算，有仇不得报。今天工人翻了身作了主人，重庆市人民法院接纳工人意见，认真执行中央人民政府毛主席所发布的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，使特务恶霸方熙池终于得到了应得的惩处。
