　　Overcoming the Spring Famine and Striving for a Bountiful Summer Harvest
"Famine fears the tail, not the head." Now, in the spring famine season, it is precisely the time to "fear the tail," as this is the final hurdle to overcome. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has opportunely issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Production and Disaster Relief Work During the Spring Famine Period," which practically and concisely points out the issues that deserve attention in the current production and disaster relief work. The people's governments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas should carefully study these instructions and conduct in-depth publicity among the vast number of cadres and the masses to transform them into practical actions.

Based on past experience, cadres and the masses in disaster areas tend to develop two kinds of thoughts after the start of spring: one is complacency with the existing achievements, thinking that after working hard all winter, the summer harvest is approaching and they can "take a break." Thus, they become negligent and careless. The other is a feeling that the arrival of the spring famine brings increased difficulties, and as a result, they cannot muster the energy for work and production. These two kinds of thoughts often produce the same result: they can turn a mild disaster into a severe one, and an already severe disaster into an even greater one. Leadership at all levels must have a clear understanding of this and must never relax ideological leadership or slacken the guidance and inspection of specific tasks just because "we already have a grasp on getting through the famine."

After the start of spring, there are many things to do in various places. Leadership at all levels must make good arrangements based on the different situations of different regions and at different times. The instructions on production and disaster relief promulgated by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 19, 1949, clearly pointed out that "the people's governments and people's organizations at all levels in disaster areas should take production and disaster relief as the center of their work." Various tasks in disaster areas can only be carried out in combination if they do not hinder and are beneficial to the disaster victims' production and getting through the famine.

The central task of spring production and disaster relief should be to strive to solve the spring plowing difficulties of the disaster victims and strive to sow seeds in a timely manner. In particular, more melons, vegetables, and early-maturing crops should be planted. Planting one "fen" of vegetables per person can supplement the diet for one or two months. "No one should die of hunger," and "not a single mu of land should be left uncultivated" should become the current slogans for action in all disaster areas. Experience has proven that this is the main way to shorten the disaster period. There are many difficulties in spring plowing in disaster areas, and the way to overcome them should be: government departments concerned should better cooperate under unified leadership, and the vast strength of the people, regardless of men, women, old, and young, should be organized to carry out various forms of labor mutual aid and lending mutual aid.

In the Huai River, Yongding River, Daqing River, and other basins, attention should also be paid to strengthening ditch and irrigation projects to ensure a good summer harvest for all or most of the area.

### 战胜春荒，争取夏季丰收

　　战胜春荒，争取夏季丰收
    “灾荒怕尾不怕头”，现在春荒季节正是“怕尾”的时候，这是度荒的最后难关。中央人民政府内务部适时地发布了《关于春荒期间加强生产救灾工作的指示》，切实而扼要地指出了目前生产救灾工作应注意的问题，有灾地区的各级人民政府应认真研究，并向广大干部和群众作深入宣传，使之变为实际行动。
    根据历年经验，入春后灾区干部和群众容易产生两种思想：一种是满足于现有的成绩，以为辛苦了一冬，夏收快到，可以“歇一歇啦”，于是麻痹大意起来；另一种是感觉春荒到来，困难增多，因而对工作和生产提不起劲。这两种思想常产生同一结果，它会使轻灾变重，重灾愈益发展。各级领导机关对此须有清醒的估计，绝不可因为“度荒的把握已经有了”，而放松思想的领导，放松了具体工作的指导和检查。
    入春后，各地都有很多事情要做。各级领导机关必须很好地根据不同地区的情况和不同时机来安排；中央人民政府政务院一九四九年十二月十九日公布的关于生产救灾的指示中曾明确指出：“灾区的各级人民政府及人民团体要把生产救灾作为工作的中心”。灾区的各种工作，只有在不妨害而且有利于灾民生产度荒的条件下，才可结合进行。
    春季生产救灾的中心工作应该是努力解决灾民的春耕困难，争取适时下种。尤其要多种瓜菜和早熟作物，每人种一分菜即可补助一两个月的食用；“不饿死一个人”，“不荒一亩地”，应成为各灾区当前的行动口号。经验证明，这是缩短灾期的主要办法。灾区春耕的困难是很多的，克服的办法应该是：政府各有关部门在统一领导下更好地通力合作，把广大的人民群众力量，不分男、女、老、幼组织起来，开展各种劳动互助和借贷互助。
    在淮河、永定河、大清河等流域，还要注意加强沟洫工程，保证全部或大部有良好的夏收。
