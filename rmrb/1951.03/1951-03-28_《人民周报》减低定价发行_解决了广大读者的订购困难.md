*People's Weekly* Reduces Price for Publication, Solving Ordering Difficulties for the Broad Masses of Readers

To the Editorial Department:

    I read the news item "People's Weekly Reduces Price to Promote Publication" published in the upper left corner of the third page of the People's Daily on March 13th twice. I deeply appreciate your spirit of serving the readers.

    The content of the *People's Weekly* mainly includes the most important documents, editorials, and special articles published in the People's Daily each week. It clearly makes us understand the development of the domestic and international situation and our current tasks. It continuously improves our political and cultural level. It is our precious spiritual food and our guide for work, study, and life. You have come up with a way to take care of readers who cannot afford to subscribe to the People's Daily, and you are willing to lose money at cost, reduce prices, and bring us such favorable learning conditions. We are extremely grateful, and I represent the readers with financial difficulties to pay tribute to you.

    Now that you care about us so much, I firmly express that in the future, I will seize the opportunity to study in a timely manner, save spare money in daily life, subscribe for a long time, not only read it myself, but also tell it to others.

        Jian Ruinian, Third Grade, Normal Department, Jinan Middle School, Shandong Province

　　《人民周报》减低定价发行
    解决了广大读者的订购困难编辑同志：
    人民日报在三月十三日三版左上角刊登一条《人民周报减低定价推广发行》的新闻，我重复地读了两遍，我深深体会到你们这种为读者服务的精神。
    人民周报的内容主要的是包括人民日报每周登载的最重要的文件、社论、专论等。它明确的使我们认识了国内外形势的发展以及目前我们的任务。使我们在政治水平上、文化水平上都在不断地提高。它是我们宝贵的精神粮食，是我们工作、学习、生活的导师。你们为照顾无力订阅人民日报的读者想出了办法，不惜亏损成本，减低价格，给我们带来了多么有利的学习条件。我们感激万分，我代表经济困难的读者向你们致敬。
    现在你们既然这样关心我们，我坚决表示：今后更要及时地抓紧学习机会，并在日常生活中节余零钱，长期订阅下去，不但自己看，还要讲给别人听。
                山东省立济宁中学师范部三年级  简瑞年
