Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 23rd: The movement of the West German people against the Adenauer "government" is rising daily. Strikes and demonstrations in various places have become more and more frequent, and the scale has also become larger and larger. On the 21st, hundreds of thousands of workers in Bavaria held demonstrations in several cities to oppose the disastrous economic policies of the Bonn "government." In Nuremberg, 80,000 workers stopped work and participated in a mass rally organized by the West German trade unions to protest against rising prices. The conference demanded that the Bonn "government" accept the economic program of the trade unions and dismiss West German "Chancellor" Adenauer and "Economic Minister" Erhard. After the meeting, the workers marched on the streets, chanting slogans against Adenauer and Erhard. In Augsburg, more than 30,000 workers held a meeting to protest against the economic policies of the Bonn "government" and rising prices. In Munich, 1,200 factory committee chairmen, representing 100,000 workers, held a meeting demanding a fundamental change in West Germany's economic policy. The workers issued an "ultimatum" demanding Erhard's resignation, strictly prohibiting capital imports, and allowing workers to participate in factory management as representatives. The "ultimatum" declared: "If the government and parliament are not prepared to implement these conditions, we will launch a struggle to dissolve this parliament that has never done anything for the people."

In the Ruhr area, more than 10,000 workers in gas, water, and electricity factories in Wuppertal have been on strike since the 21st, demanding a monthly wage increase of 40 marks. The city's tram and railway systems have been paralyzed as a result. The workers decided that they would never resume work if their demands were not met.

Hundreds of women in Nuremberg held a demonstration on the 16th, opposing Adenauer's "starvation policy," opposing re-militarization, opposing the collection of war taxes, and opposing rising prices. Regardless of police attacks, they shouted "Down with Adenauer" along the way.

Recently, 300 women with various political views held a meeting in Kiel Port, demanding the removal of Bonn "Chancellor" Adenauer. They passed a resolution stating that Adenauer is leading Germany to destruction, therefore, "it is the duty of every peace-loving German to demand the resignation of the traitor Adenauer and his servants."

　　西德各地工人妇女罢工示威
    要求卖国贼阿登纳等辞职
    【新华社二十三日讯】据电通社柏林消息：西德人民反对阿登纳“政府”的运动日益高涨。各地的罢工与示威已越来越频繁，规模也越来越大了。二十一日，巴伐利亚省有数十万工人在好几个城市里举行示威，反对波恩“政府”灾难性的经济政策。在纽伦堡，八万工人停止工作，参加了西德工会所组织的群众大会，抗议物价的上涨。大会要求波恩“政府”接受工会的经济纲领，并把西德“总理”阿登纳和“经济部长”艾哈德免职。大会结束后，工人们到街上游行，高呼反对阿登纳和艾哈德的口号。在奥格斯堡，三万余工人举行会议，抗议波恩“政府”的经济政策和物价上涨。在慕尼黑，代表着十万工人的一千二百名工厂委员会主席举行会议，要求根本改变西德的经济政策。工人们发出“最后通牒”，要求艾哈德辞职，严禁资本输入，并允许工人派代表参加工厂的管理。“最后通牒”宣称：“如果政府和议会不准备实行这些条件，我们就要为解散这个从来都不为人民做事的议会而展开斗争。”
    在鲁尔区，窝伯塔尔城各煤气、水、电工厂中，已有万余工人自二十一日起罢工，要求每月增加工资四十马克。该城电车和铁路系统已因此陷于停顿。工人们决定，如果要求不能满足，就决不复工。
    纽伦堡的妇女数百人，十六日举行了示威游行，反对阿登纳的“饥饿政策”，反对重新军国主义化，反对征收战争税和物价上涨，她们不顾警察的袭击，一路上高呼“打倒阿登纳”的口号。
    最近基尔港有三百个具有各种政见的妇女开会，要求把波恩“总理”阿登纳撤职。她们通过决议称：阿登纳正在把德国引向毁灭，因此，“要求卖国贼阿登纳及其从仆们辞职是每个爱好和平的德国人的职责”。
