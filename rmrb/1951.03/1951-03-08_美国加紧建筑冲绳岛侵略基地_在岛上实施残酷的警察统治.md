　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 7th: TASS dispatch: Reports in Japanese newspapers confirm that Okinawa Island is increasingly becoming an American military base. Large-scale construction work on airfields and other military targets is underway. According to the Okinawa "Oruku Shinpo" (transliteration), the U.S. military authorities have specifically signed contracts with two Japanese electrical companies, "Shibaura" and "Shimizu Corporation," to open power stations to supply the needs of the U.S. military on the island. When the United States began its aggressive actions in Korea, the United States constructed twenty-five airfields on Okinawa Island, and currently U.S. military aircraft take off from there to bomb Korean cities and villages.
    The U.S. military occupation authorities forcibly expel local residents of Okinawa Island from their homeland, and that land is designated for the construction of military targets. For example, according to the newspaper, the U.S. military authorities have evicted 2,106 people from the Iheya (transliteration) district. A brutal police rule is implemented on the island. American soldiers treat the masses with terror. The newspaper reported many atrocities such as American soldiers beating and looting civilians, as well as raping women.

　　美国加紧建筑冲绳岛侵略基地
    在岛上实施残酷的警察统治
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社东京讯：日本报纸上的消息证实冲绳岛已日益变成美国的军事基地。关于飞机场和其他军事目标的大规模构筑工事，正在进行中。据冲绳《小禄新报》（译音）指出：美军当局已特别与“芝浦”及“清水制作”两家日本电气公司签订合同，开办发电站以供该岛美军的需要。当美国在朝鲜开始侵略行动时，美国在冲绳岛构筑了二十五处飞机场，目前美军飞机就从那儿起飞去轰炸朝鲜城市和乡村。
    美军占领当局用强迫手段将冲绳岛当地的居民逐出自己的乡土，那些土地被圈定为构筑军事目标。例如，据该报说，美军当局已从回浦（译音）区内放逐了二千一百零六人。岛上实施残酷的警察统治。美国军人以恐怖手段对待群众。该报报道了美国兵殴打、劫掠平民以及奸污妇女等暴行多起。
