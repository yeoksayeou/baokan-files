    China, Korea, Hungary Embrace
    —Drawn by Huang Jing—
    (Sixteen) Ten minutes later, the enemy planes flew away. When the fifty-six boxes of medicine were safely loaded onto the truck, next to the truck, on two intact medicine boxes, lay the child's body quietly. Her back was facing upwards, with five bullet holes in her back, fresh blood gushing out, soaking her clothes and flowing onto the wooden boxes.
    (Seventeen) Wang Huaiduo held the child with his own injured hands. China, Korea, and Hungary, intertwining blood and hatred, consolidated their common belief with life and will!
    (Eighteen) The medicine arrived victoriously at the field hospital. The wounded shouted in Korean and Chinese: "After we recover, we will eliminate more American devils to repay you!" (The End)

    中国、朝鲜、匈牙利拥抱在一起
    —黄景作—
    （十六）十分钟以后，敌机飞走了。当五十六箱药品平安地搬上汽车的时候，在车的旁边，在两只完整无损的药品箱子上，静静地躺着孩子的尸体。她的背朝天，背上有五个弹孔，鲜血冒了出来，浸透了她的衣裳 ，一直流到木箱子上。
    （十七）王怀铎用他自己受伤的手抱住了孩子。中国、朝鲜、匈牙利，把血和恨交织在一起，用生命和意志巩固了共同的信念！
    （十八）药品胜利地到达了战地医院。伤员们用着朝鲜话和中国话一齐喊着：“伤好以后，多消灭美国鬼子，来报答你们！”		（完）
