The spokesperson of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a statement expressing extreme support for the Central People's Government's important measure of promulgating the "Regulations on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries of the People's Republic of China" to resolutely suppress counterrevolutionary activities. The statement is as follows:

Today, when the people of the whole country have achieved a great revolutionary victory in liberating the motherland, and when the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has developed to a universally deep and victorious stage, the U.S.-led imperialists and the reactionary remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs are not reconciled to their failure and demise. They use various means, methods, conspiracies, and tricks to instigate bandits, secret agents, despots, landlords, reactionary Taoist sects, gangs, and other counterrevolutionaries to carry out all kinds of counterrevolutionary activities on the Chinese mainland. Their purpose is obviously to undermine the people's democratic cause and endanger the people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, the revolutionary people and the revolutionary people's government must not tolerate this and must quickly use all methods and forces to resolutely suppress counterrevolutionary activities.

The "Regulations on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries of the People's Republic of China" recently promulgated by the Central People's Government demonstrates that the Chinese people have taken out an effective legal weapon to eliminate all counterrevolutionary forces, especially striking at their behind-the-scenes first instigator—U.S. imperialism. We see that the main content and spirit of these regulations are: to severely punish all those who collude with imperialism and betray the motherland; those who are dispatched by enemies at home and abroad to carry out hidden activities; those who participate in counterrevolutionary secret service or espionage organizations to carry out counterrevolutionary activities after liberation; those who participated in counterrevolutionary organizations before and after liberation and continue to carry out counterrevolutionary activities after being educated and released by the People's Government or registering with the People's Government and surrendering themselves; those who use the names of military and political organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations to forge official documents and certificates to engage in counterrevolutionary activities; and to suppress other counterrevolutionary activities, etc. The reason why such regulations are necessary is precisely to meet the actual needs of suppressing counterrevolutionary activities at the present time. We believe that as the People's Government promulgates these regulations and implements them, and as the people of the whole country widely launch a movement to suppress counterrevolutionaries, the forces of counterrevolution will eventually be completely eliminated, and the people's democratic dictatorship will be greatly consolidated.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang believes that the Central People's Government's implementation of this resolute policy of suppressing counterrevolutionaries is a timely and important measure, and calls on all party members to unanimously express their support with action; and to heighten vigilance, do their best to prevent all counterrevolutionaries from infiltrating the party or engaging in counterrevolutionary activities in the name of the party, and to more actively participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and land reform, in order to thoroughly complete this major task of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　民革发言人发表谈话
    拥护惩治反革命条例
    号召党员对反革命分子提高警惕
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会发言人对中央人民政府为坚决镇压反革命活动，公布了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”这一重要的措施，表示极端拥护，特发表谈话如下：
    在全国人民解放祖国伟大革命胜利的今天，并在抗美援朝爱国运动发展到普遍深入的胜利阶段，以美国为首的帝国主义者及反动残余的蒋介石匪帮们不甘心它们的失败和灭亡，用各种方式方法，阴谋诡计，发纵指使土匪、特务、恶霸、地主、反动道门、帮会及其他反革命分子在中国大陆上进行一切反革命活动，其目的很显然地是要破坏人民民主事业，危害人民民主专政；因此，革命的人民和革命的人民政府，对此决不能容忍，必须迅速地用一切方法和力量，坚决镇压反革命活动。
    中央人民政府最近所公布的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，就是说明了中国人民拿出了一个有效力的法律武器，来消灭一切反革命力量，尤其是打击了它们的幕后第一指使人——美帝国主义者。我们看出这条例的主要内容和精神是：要严厉制裁一切勾结帝国主义背叛祖国者；受国内外敌人派遣潜伏活动者；解放后参加反革命特务或间谍组织进行反革命活动者；解放前、后参加反革命组织经人民政府教育释放或向人民政府登记自首后仍继续进行反革命活动者；假借军政机关、民主党派、人民团体名义，伪造公文证件从事反革命活动者；以及镇压其他反革命活动等等；其所以必须如此规定，也正是说明为了适应当前镇压反革命活动事实上的需要。我们相信：由于人民政府颁布这条例和贯彻实施，加以全国人民广泛展开镇压反革命的运动，反革命的势力必然会终于完全肃清；人民民主专政要大大地巩固起来。
    中国国民党革命委员会对于中央人民政府执行这一坚决镇压反革命的政策，认为是一个及时的重要的措施，号召全体党员一致以行动来表示拥护；并提高警惕，尽力防止一切反革命分子钻入本党或假借本党名义从事反革命的活动，还要更积极地参加抗美援朝爱国运动和土地改革，以彻底完成这一巩固人民民主专政的重大任务。
