　　Shanghai Audiences Cheer for Progressive Films
　　　　Wang Rong
　　Shanghai has been liberated for one year and ten months. This city, which has always relied on imperialism and has therefore been most deeply affected by it, has undergone fundamental changes in this short period of less than two years. The American poisonous films that had long been rampant in Shanghai were finally kicked out by the people of Shanghai in November of last year during the upsurge of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The grand occasion of showing progressive films during the Spring Festival this year is even beyond what American films could compare with in the past. Judging from the number of first-run audiences alone, the state-owned factory film "Steel Fighter" reached 245,923, the joint state-private factory film "Two Families' Spring" reached 262,322, the private factory film "Sisters Stand Up" reached 231,387, and the Soviet film "Secret Envoy," because it reflects the more specialized subject matter of international political struggle, also reached 138,935, equivalent to the number of first-run audiences for the film "The Story of My Life," which was considered to have the best business situation in February and March last year.
　　But what kind of struggle has been gone through to achieve this transformation in the ideological consciousness of the audience and the improvement of appreciation level? I think it is beneficial for our future work to review the course of this struggle and gain experience from it.
　　Shanghai has more than forty cinemas, and before liberation, the vast majority of these cinemas were controlled by the so-called "Big Eight Companies" of American film merchants. The monthly cinema audience reached more than two million, and the audience watching American poisonous films accounted for more than half. The American film merchants wanted to make huge profits, and the ticket prices were high. This situation also had a benefit in hindsight, that is, people without money were kept outside the cinema door and were spared from being poisoned. Then the audience for American films was of course composed of imperialist elements, foreign merchants, bureaucrats, compradors, landlords, and speculative merchants who lived an extravagant life in this "adventurers' paradise" as the mainstay, plus the urban population and young intellectuals. The vast majority of workers rarely watched American films because they couldn't afford it and weren't interested in it. After the liberation of Shanghai, these "mainstay elements" fled or declined, and what remained were the urban population and young intellectuals. For these audiences, it is not so much that they loved to watch American films, but that during the period of imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule, Shanghai cinemas were controlled by American film merchants, and they were forced to watch American films. Over time, they became accustomed to watching American films, just like being addicted to opium. For these audiences, we can only take a healing attitude. Only when their political awareness is universally improved and they have some understanding and gradually like progressive films will they ideologically recognize the poison of American films, and then abandon them, just like healthy people do not smoke opium. Therefore, it is essential to avoid using a simple administrative order to forbid them from watching American poisonous films, as this cannot solve their ideological problems. In fact, as in September of the year before last, the Shanghai public opinion circles demanded a ban on American poisonous films, which caused panic among some audiences, but instead made every cinema showing American films fully occupied; in April and May of last year, there were also young victims, male and female "Ah Feis," who imitated the "heroes" in American films, robbing things, playing with women, and so on. These all illustrate the profound influence of films, as one of the important tools of American imperialist cultural aggression, on Shanghai.
　　Therefore, our struggle against harmful American films is mainly based on the degree of continuous improvement of the political awareness and appreciation level of the vast audience in Shanghai after liberation, and the supply of progressive films (Shanghai has more than forty cinemas, and the monthly supply of films required is about two hundred).
　　First of all, we vigorously promoted the propaganda of progressive films, and combined it with the resolute implementation of low ticket price policy (including chartering and preferential ticket methods) and reducing the entertainment tax on progressive films, in order to consolidate and expand the basic audience of progressive films, with special emphasis on organized groups of workers, staff, government cadres, and young students, and to win over the general urban audience, so that the propaganda of progressive films is combined with the actual movements at that time. For example, through the screening of films such as "The Fall of Berlin," "The Great Battle of Stalingrad," and "They Have a Motherland," we combined them with the study of the anti-aggression war and the defense of world peace movement; through the screening of films such as "The Great Friendship" and "The Youth Assembly," we combined them with the education of internationalism; through the screening of films such as "The Invisible Front," "The Giant Palm of the People," "Corrosion," and "Youth City," we combined them with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the efforts to improve winter defense work; through the screening of films such as "My Hometown" and "Defending the Homeland," we combined them with the study of the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending the homeland; through the screening of films such as "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Liberated China," "Sons and Daughters of China," and "Zhao Yiman," we combined them with the education of new patriotism. In this way, progressive films are closely linked to the actual lives of the audience.
　　In order to better connect the basic audience of progressive films and win over the general audience, in addition to regularly publishing popular film reviews, film activity reports, and film photos in the supplements of various newspapers, we also founded the "Popular Cinema" bi-monthly magazine. Since its publication on June 1 last year, because its content and form were loved by the working people—especially the working class—the sales volume of the first issue reached 15,000 copies, and each issue has gradually increased since then. Up to now, the sales volume of each issue has reached 35,000 copies. Among them, the tenth issue, in order to combine with the propaganda of the historical documentary "The Victory of the Chinese People," published a special issue, with a sales volume of as many as 100,000 copies. Among the readers of the "Popular Cinema" bi-monthly magazine, the average sales volume through the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions accounts for 32.9%; the average sales volume through schools accounts for 15.9%; the sales volume through cinemas accounts for 16.95%; the average sales volume through newspaper stalls accounts for 15.9%; the average sales volume through other places accounts for 22.38%; and other average sales volume accounts for 1.67%. These figures show that in these short nine months, the "Popular Cinema" bi-monthly magazine has had a great influence on the workers and students in Shanghai. The publication of each issue is a great encouragement to the screening of progressive films and a heavy blow to negative films.
　　For negative films, headed by American films, we have adopted the method of restricting their screening days in a planned and step-by-step manner, and rarely use the method of banning them. For example, there were more than 700 American films left in Shanghai after liberation. Among them, in addition to the 23 films that were advised to stop showing due to their extremely reactionary content, the others were still allowed to be shown in Shanghai. In April of last year, as the audience's level of appreciation gradually improved and the supply of progressive films gradually increased, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture issued six provisional regulations on cinema film scheduling on April 25, appropriately reducing the screening days of American and British films. After the implementation of this method, the number of audiences for American and British films underwent a dramatic change, from 761,423 in April (accounting for 48.7% of the total number of audiences in that month) to 440,692 in May (accounting for 28% of the total number of audiences in that month). Since then, the number of audiences for American and British films has continued to decline with the increase in audience awareness, and has been in a slump.
　　We can understand the reasons for the dramatic change in the number of audiences after the implementation of the provisional regulations on film scheduling from the statistical figures. In May of last year, the average number of audiences for each state-owned film was 25,659, the average number of audiences for each private progressive film was 12,320, and the average number of audiences for each American and British film was only 5,896. This shows that progressive films have gradually gained the love of more audiences in Shanghai, and the appeal of American and British poisonous films has been greatly weakened. The reason why their audience number could maintain 761,423 in April last year was because their supply still accounted for an absolute advantage, with 140 films being screened. Therefore, when we compressed their screening days with film scheduling ratio regulations in May last year, the number of films screened was reduced to 75, and the number of audiences also decreased from 761,423 to 440,692. After May of last year, the supply of progressive films and the average number of audiences per film gradually increased, while American and British poisonous films were increasingly rejected by the vast audience, so by October of last year, their audience number was only 277,360, accounting for 12.7% of the audience number. After such a fierce struggle and change, progressive films finally decisively defeated American films in front of the vast audience. When the people of Shanghai launched a warm anti-American and aid-Korea, defend-the-homeland movement in November of last year, many audiences initiated patriotic actions to not watch American films. Then, the employees of the Shanghai cinema industry and Western film distribution industry also expressed their patriotic actions by refusing to show American films. In this way, American films, which had long occupied Shanghai and poisoned the people, declared their death in the situation of the unprecedented improvement of the political awareness of the vast audience and the continuous arrival of progressive films.
　　After the refusal to show American films in Shanghai, there was a small episode. Some students, especially those in church schools, did not have enough understanding of American films and could not understand them ideologically. Therefore, each school invited film critics to give lectures and hold seminars, analyze the essence of American films and their role as sugar-coated bullets, and conduct specific analysis of typical American poisonous films, in order to solve the ideological problems of these few young students who had been accustomed to watching American films since childhood.
　　After the above-mentioned tortuous and meticulous struggle, the appreciation level of Shanghai film audiences was finally greatly improved. With the in-depth development of the great anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement, the unprecedented improvement of the people's political awareness, the increase of domestic films and films from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, it is inevitable that progressive films have received the most enthusiastic cheers from the vast audience in Shanghai.

### 上海观众为进步电影而欢呼

　　上海观众为进步电影而欢呼
        王容
    上海解放已经一年十个月，这个一向依靠帝国主义，因此受帝国主义影响最深的城市，在这短短不到两年的期间，已经起了根本上的变化。长期泛滥于上海的美国毒素电影，终于在去年十一月间抗美援朝运动高涨的时候被上海人民一脚踢了出去，而今年春节上映进步影片时的盛况，更非昔日美国电影所能比拟的了。仅就头轮观众人数来看，国营厂片《钢铁战士》即达二四五、九二三人，公私合营厂片《两家春》即达二六二、三二二人，私营厂片《姊姊妹妹站起来》即达二三一、三八七人，而苏联片的《秘密使节》，因为是反映比较专门的国际政治斗争题材，但也达到一三八、九三五人之多，相当于去年二三月间被认为营业情况最佳的影片《我这一辈子》的头轮观众人数。
    但是这种观众思想意识上的转变，欣赏水平的提高，是经过了怎样的斗争才得来的呢？我想回顾这个斗争的经过，从而取得经验，对于我们今后的工作是有益处的。
    上海共有四十多家影院，解放前这些影院的绝大多数都控制在美国影片商所谓“八大公司”手里，每月影院观众达二百余万，而看美国毒素电影的观众却占了一半还要多些。美国影片商要谋暴利，票价卖得高，这情形现在看来也还有一个好处，就是没有钱的人虽然被关在影院门外，却也免受了毒害。那么美国电影的观众当然是以在这“冒险家的乐园”过着穷奢极侈生活的帝国主义分子、洋商、官僚、买办、地主和投机商人等为中坚，加上市民层和青年知识分子而组成的，广大的工人很少看美国电影，看不起，也不感兴趣。上海解放后，这些“中坚分子”逃的逃，没落的没落，剩下的便是市民层和青年知识分子。对于这些观众与其说他们爱看美国电影，不如说在帝国主义、国民党反动派统治时期，上海影院被美国片商把持下，他们是被迫去看美国电影的，这样久而久之，看惯了美国电影，就像是鸦片烟抽上了瘾一样。对于这些观众，只能抱治病救人的态度，只有在他们政治觉悟普遍提高，对进步电影有所认识而逐渐喜爱的时候，才会从思想上认清美国电影的毒害，然后弃而绝之，正像恢复健康的人不要抽鸦片烟一样。因此切忌用单纯行政命令的方式不许他们看美国毒素电影，这样是不能解决他们思想问题的。事实上如前年九月间上海舆论界要求禁映美国毒素电影而引起某些观众的恐慌，反而使映美国片的戏院家家客满；去年四五月间，也还有年青受害的男女《阿飞》，模仿美国片中的《好汉》，抢东西、玩女人等等现象。这些都说明了作为美国帝国主义文化侵略重要工具之一的电影，对上海有了怎样深重的影响。
    因此，我们对美国有害电影的斗争，主要是依据解放后上海广大观众政治觉悟和欣赏水平不断提高的程度，和进步影片供应的情况（上海四十多家影院，每月所需的影片供应量约二百部左右）来进行的。
    首先是大力展开推广进步电影的宣传，并结合坚决实行低票价政策（包括包场和优待券等办法）和减低进步电影的娱乐税，以巩固并扩大进步电影的基本观众，特别着重在工人、职员、机关干部和青年学生等有组织群众，并争取一般市民观众，使进步影片的宣传和当时的实际运动相结合。如通过《攻克柏林》、《斯大林格勒大血战》、《他们有祖国》等影片的上映，和反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平运动的学习相结合；通过《伟大的友谊》、《青年大会师》等影片的上映，和国际主义的教育相结合；通过影片《无形的战线》、《人民的巨掌》、《腐蚀》、《青年城》的上映，和镇压反革命搞好冬防工作的学习相结合；通过影片《我的故乡》、《卫国保家》的上映，和抗美援朝、保家卫国伟大运动的学习相结合；通过《中国人民的胜利》、《解放了的中国》、《中华女儿》、《赵一曼》等影片的上映，来和新爱国主义的教育相结合。这样进步电影便和观众的实际生活密切联系在一起。
    为了更好的联系进步电影的基本观众和争取一般观众，我们除了在各报副刊上经常发表通俗的电影评介、电影活动报道、电影照片外，并创办了《大众电影》半月刊，自去年六月一日出版后，由于它的内容和形式得到劳动人民——特别是工人阶级的喜爱，第一期的销数即达一万五千份，以后每期逐有增加，到目前为止每期销数达三万五千份，其中第十期为了结合历史文献巨片《中国人民的胜利》的宣传，曾出了专刊，销数达十万份之多。在《大众电影》半月刊读者中，通过上海总工会推销的平均占百分之三二·九；学校推销的平均占百分之一五·九；影院推销的占百分之一六·九五；报摊推销的平均占百分之一五·九；外埠推销的平均占百分之二二·三八；其他平均占百分之一·六七。这些数字说明了在这短短的九个月中，《大众电影》半月刊在上海工人和学生群众中，已经起了很大的影响，它每期的出版，对于进步影片的上映是一个很大的鼓舞，对消极影片是当头一棒。
    对于以美国电影为首的消极影片，我们则采取有计划有步骤的加以限制其放映天数的办法，而很少用禁映的办法。如解放后存留在上海的美片有七百余部之多，其中除因内容极端反动，先后劝告停映二十三部者外，其他仍让其在上海上映。去年四月间，由于观众欣赏水平已逐渐提高，进步影片的供应量也逐渐增加，于是上海市人民政府文化局便于四月二十五日发布了影院排片暂行六项规定，适当地缩减了美英影片的上映天数。执行了这个办法后，美英影片的观众人数发生了激剧的变化，从四月份的七六一、四二三人（占该月份观众总人数百分之四十八·七），到五月份便降到四四○、六九二人（占该月份观众总人数百分之二十八），自此美英影片观众人数跟着观众觉悟的提高而不断下降，一蹶不振。
    执行排片暂行的规定后，观众人数之所以发生激剧变化的原因，我们可以从统计数字上加以了解。去年五月份国营片观众人数平均每部二五、六五九人，私营进步片观众人数平均每部一二、三二○人，而美英片观众人数平均每部则仅五、八九六人。这说明了进步影片已逐渐取得上海更多观众的喜爱，而美英毒素影片的吸引力已大大的减弱，其在去年四月份的观众人数之所以能维持七六一、四二三人，是由于其供应量仍占绝对优势，上映了一四○部影片的缘故。因此当我们在去年五月份用排片比例规定压缩其放映天数时，其放映影片的部数减到七十五部，而观众人数也跟着从七六一、四二三人减到四四○、六九二人。去年五月以后，进步影片的供应量和平均每部观众人数仍逐渐增加，而美英毒素影片越加受广大观众所唾弃，所以到去年十月间其观众人数仅二七七、三六○人，占观众人数的百分之十二·七。经过了这样激烈的斗争和变化，进步影片终于在广大观众的面前决定性的战胜了美国电影。及至去年十一月间上海人民展开热烈的抗美援朝、保家卫国运动时，许多观众便发起不看美国电影的爱国行动，接着上海影院业和西片发行业职工也以拒映美片来表示自己的爱国行动。这样，长期盘踞上海，毒害人民的美国电影，在广大观众政治觉悟空前提高，进步影片源源而来的情形下宣告其寿终正寝。
    在上海拒映美国影片后，还发生了一个小插曲。某些学校，尤其是教会学校的学生们，对美国影片的认识不足，思想上搞不通，于是便由各校请影评工作者去演讲，开座谈会，分析美国影片的本质，及其糖衣毒药的作用，对典型的美国毒素影片进行具体的分析，从而来解决这些少数从小看惯美国影片的青年学生的思想问题。
    经过上述曲折而细致的斗争，上海电影观众的欣赏水平终于大大地提高。随着伟大抗美援朝爱国主义运动的深入开展，人民政治觉悟的空前提高，国产片和苏联及新民主主义国家影片的增加，进步影片得到上海广大观众最热烈的欢呼，是很必然的一件事情了。
