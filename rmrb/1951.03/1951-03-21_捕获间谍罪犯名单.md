Soon after, he was introduced by Japanese special agent Hatsutaro Ito to work for the American intelligence agency.

He followed Wang Ruoxi to set up a secret radio station in Tianjin. In 1942, he also participated in the special agent organization of the Kuomintang Party and Government Corps and continued to work in the underground radio station. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang bandit gang gave him an important position in the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau to manage the machine affairs. He was retained by us after the liberation of Tianjin. His younger brother, Gu Zongfan, was ordered by American special agents to go into hiding before the liberation of Tianjin. He first set up the radio station in Gu Zongde's telecommunications bureau dormitory, and secretly stored the radio parts there, using the agency dormitory as a cover in order to ensure safety.
