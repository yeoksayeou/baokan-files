The State Council of the Central People's Government, at its 70th executive meeting on February 2nd, passed the "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951," which stipulated that increasing grain production, increasing industrial raw materials, and planting trees and forests, especially increasing the production of cotton, hemp, and tobacco, are the main goals for this year's agricultural and forestry production. On March 5th, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Instructions on Ensuring the Completion of This Year's Agricultural and Forestry Production Tasks," which clearly pointed out that agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural work, and instructed rural Youth League members to actively carry out a nationwide patriotic production movement under the leadership of the Party, together with the peasant masses, to ensure the complete fulfillment of the national agricultural and forestry production tasks for 1951. Therefore, rural Youth League organizations should highly develop their initiative and actively shoulder the glorious and enormous tasks given to us by the Party. To this end:

    I. All levels of the Youth League Committee, down to the grassroots Youth League organizations in rural areas, must combine in-depth patriotic ideological education on resisting America and aiding Korea with the conscientious study and publicity of the principles and tasks of agricultural and forestry production in 1951, especially the various policies that must be implemented to ensure increased production, so as to mobilize Youth League members to consciously participate in the patriotic production movement (in old liberated areas, it's a bumper harvest movement) and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production. Branches can adopt methods such as listening to lectures from Party branches, guidance from instructors, explanations by cadres in people's schools, and discussions by Youth League branches to organize members to study in a planned way. At the same time, in accordance with the local government's requirements for agricultural and forestry production and in response to the ideological concerns of the masses, extensive publicity and explanation work should be carried out through mutual aid teams, people's schools, plays, blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, etc. Youth League members should take the lead in production, set a good example, and influence the masses. The propaganda departments of the provincial Youth League committees should formulate specific plans based on local conditions, compile teaching materials, and conduct this work in a guided manner.

    II. It is essential to be good at playing an active role in educating oneself and motivating others in the important links of agricultural production under the leadership of the Party.

    (1) "Organize and develop production" is the direction of rural economic development. The Youth League should universally conduct this ideological education and continue to implement the principles of voluntary, equivalent exchange, and democratic management of labor mutual aid. This year, rural Youth League organizations must gain experience in this area and make significant achievements. In the old liberated areas, a large number of Youth League members have already joined mutual aid teams. The main issue at present is how to enable Youth League members to improve their skills in mutual aid teams and play a role in work combined with sideline occupations. Youth League committees in various regions should carefully summarize experiences and further guide the work of rural Youth Leagues in consolidating and improving mutual aid teams. In areas where land reform is nearing completion, Youth League organizations should actively help peasants gradually create conditions to promote the organization of labor mutual aid teams.

    (2) Strengthen agricultural technical education for cadres and Youth League members, and actively participate in the promotion of new farming methods and the movement to improve technology. Experience has proven that young peasants are active in learning and promoting new farming methods and agricultural technologies. If rural Youth League cadres do not understand agricultural knowledge and agricultural technology, it will be impossible to lead production well. Therefore, rural Youth League organizations must always attach importance to agricultural technology learning. Youth League committees at all levels should proactively obtain the government's consent to select certain cadres to participate in agricultural technical schools, training classes, technical research committees, and technical groups organized by the government; or invite cadres from government agricultural departments or agricultural experts to give reports at certain meetings of the Youth League; educate Youth League members to actively participate in field experiments; Youth League branches should gradually establish a system of technical classes, inviting local labor heroes or experienced old farmers to talk about farming methods; or organize visits, etc. It is required that every cadre and Youth League member working in rural areas of the old liberated areas learn one or more new agricultural production knowledge or agricultural science and technology this year, and develop the fine style of Youth League members of learning humbly and helping others patiently in this learning process. Youth League committees in various regions should actively assist local people's governments in cultivating young agricultural technical talents.

    (3) The Youth League should actively participate in various struggles to overcome natural disasters. In addition to making greater achievements in mobilizing the masses to build water conservancy projects and organizing the elimination of pests, Youth League members and the vast number of young people in mountainous, riverside, and sandy areas should support the government in completing afforestation plans. In provinces such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, and Hebei, Youth League members should be led in a planned way to participate in the huge projects of harnessing the Huai River and the Yongding River. It is necessary to establish the scientific thinking of "man will conquer nature" among Youth League members in these practical struggles.

    (4) "Ensuring the sown area and harvest of cotton, hemp, and tobacco is an extremely important task for increasing agricultural production in 1951." Youth League members should strive to persuade their families to implement the local Party and government's plans for sowing cotton, hemp, and tobacco, and use their exemplary actions to carry out patient publicity and explanation work to the masses.

    III. When leading Youth League members in agricultural production, special attention should be paid to: First, being good at discovering and cultivating various young activists in agricultural production, relying on them to unite the broad masses of young people, and enthusiastically participating in the production movement; Second, strengthening the organizational life of the Youth League in the patriotic production movement, conducting organizational education, raising the consciousness of Youth League members, and giving play to the organizational role of the grassroots organizations of the Youth League; Third, effectively grasping the key leadership methods, systematically summarizing typical experiences to guide the work; Fourth, strengthening the production education of Youth League members in the militia (especially in the new areas), so that they can actively participate in production and become models for maintaining production order and safeguarding the fruits of production.

After receiving these instructions, Youth League committees at all levels should promptly discuss and formulate specific implementation measures, and report the discussion opinions and work situation to the Central Committee of the Youth League in a timely manner.

                                March 24, 1951

　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    为农村的青年团组织贯彻执行中央人民政府政务院
   《关于一九五一年农林生产的决定》的指示
    中央人民政府政务院第七十次政务会议已于二月二日通过了《关于一九五一年农林生产的决定》，规定了增产粮食，增产工业原料，植树造林，特别是增产棉、麻、烟的任务，为今年农林生产的主要目标。三月五日中共中央发出《保证完成今年农林生产任务》的指示，又明确指出农业生产为农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务，并指示农村青年团员要在党的领导下，和农民群众一起积极开展全国性的爱国生产运动，以保证一九五一年全国农林生产任务的彻底完成。因此，农村的青年团组织应高度地发挥自己的主动性、积极性，努力肩负起党所给予我们的光荣而巨大的任务。为此：
    一、各级团委直至农村中团的基层组织，必须把深入抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育与认真学习和宣传一九五一年农林生产的方针、任务，特别是保证完成增产所必须贯彻的各项政策结合起来，以便发动团员自觉地参加爱国主义的生产运动（在老区是丰产运动），争取农业生产丰收。支部可采取听党支部上课，辅导员传授，干部在民校讲解，团支部进行讨论等办法，有计划地组织团员进行学习。同时根据当地政府对农林生产要求，针对群众思想顾虑，通过互助组，民校、演剧、黑板报、屋顶广播等，展开广泛的宣传解释工作。团员应当在生产中带头，做好样，影响群众。各省团委宣传部应根据当地不同情况，作出具体计划，编写教材，有领导地进行这一工作。
    二、必须善于在党的领导下，在农业生产的重要环节中，发挥教育自己，带动别人的积极作用。
    （一）“组织起来，发展生产”是农村经济发展的方向，团应普遍进行这一思想教育，并继续贯彻劳动互助的自愿，等价、民主管理的原则。今年农村的青年团组织必须在这方面取得经验，作出显著的成绩。老解放区农村中很大部分团员已参加了互助组，目前的主要问题，是如何使团员在互助组中提高技术并在与副业相结合的工作上发挥作用。各地团委要很好地总结经验，进一步指导农村团在巩固和提高互助组中的工作。在土地改革即将结束的地区，青年团的组织应积极地帮助农民逐渐有条件地推广劳动互助组的组织。
    （二）加强干部和团员的农业技术教育，积极参加推广新的农作方法与提高技术运动。经验证明：青年农民是学习和推广新的农作方法与农业技术的积极分子，如果农村中团的干部不懂得农业知识和农业技术，就不可能很好地去领导生产。因此，农村的青年团组织必须经常重视农业技术学习。各级团委应主动地取得政府同意，选择一定的干部参加政府举办的农业技术学校、训练班、技术研究委员会，技术小组；或在团的一定会议上请政府农业部门的干部或农业专家作报告；教育团员积极参加实地试验；团支部逐渐建立技术课的制度，请当地劳动英雄或有经验的老农讲述耕作法；或组织参观等等。要求老区农村工作的每个干部和团员，今年学会一种以上的新的农业生产知识或农业科学技术，并在这个学习过程中发扬团员虚心学习，耐心帮助别人的优良作风。各地团委应积极地协助当地人民政府培养青年农业技术人才。
    （三）青年团要积极参加克服自然灾害的各种斗争。除在发动群众兴修水利，组织起来捕灭害虫的工作上须要作出更大成绩外，在山地、沿河与沙荒地区的团员和广大青年，应支持政府完成植树造林的计划。在苏北、皖北、河南、河北等省，应有计划地领导团员参加治理淮河与永定河的巨大工程。应当在这些实际斗争中，树立团员“人定胜天”的科学思想。
    （四）“保证棉、麻、烟播种的面积和收获量，是一九五一年农业增产极为重要的一项任务”。青年团员应努力说服家庭，执行当地党和政府播种棉、麻、烟的计划，并以自己的模范行动向群众进行耐心的宣传解释工作。
    三、在领导团员进行农业生产时，应特别注意：第一、要善于发现和培养农业生产中的各种青年积极分子，依靠他们团结广大青年群众，热烈地参加生产运动；第二、在爱国主义的生产运动中，加强团的组织生活，进行组织教育，提高团员觉悟，发挥团的基层组织的组织作用；第三、切实掌握有重点的领导方法，有系统地总结典型经验，以指导工作，第四、加强民兵中团员的生产教育（特别是新区），使之积极参加生产，并成为维护生产秩序，保卫生产果实的模范。
    各级团委接此指示后，应迅速讨论拟出具体执行办法，并将讨论意见和工作情况，及时报告团中央。
                                一九五一年三月二十四日
