　　Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers inquiring about the issuance of the North China Liberation Medal. We are now providing a comprehensive response as follows.
    Question: Can personnel of units who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan in North China receive the North China Liberation Medal?
    Answer: The calculation of "Liberation War" time in the regulations for issuing the North China Liberation Medal should include both the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War periods. Those who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan in North China should also be issued the medal according to the prescribed conditions.
    Question: Should local North China workers who also held positions in the military or participated in the Military Control Commission also be issued the medal?
    Answer: Before the liberation of North China, all CCP prefectural committee secretaries concurrently serving as political commissars of military sub-districts, CCP county (district) committee secretaries, county (district) heads concurrently serving as political commissars or captains of county (district) teams, and full-time armed work committee personnel above the district level who were separated from production should be treated the same as local armed forces personnel and issued the medal according to the prescribed regulations. Local workers who participated in the work of the Military Control Commissions in various parts of North China but were not formally enlisted should not be considered members of the military establishment and should not be issued the medal.
    Question: Should female comrades who originally worked in North China units but later transferred, left their jobs to become military dependents, or returned home be issued the medal?
    Answer: Female comrades who worked in North China units for more than one year before the liberation of North China, and who later transferred or left their jobs to become military dependents due to reasons such as taking care of children or illness/weakness, with the approval of the organization, as well as those who returned home after organizational handling (excluding those expelled from the military), will be issued the medal. Those who do not meet the above conditions will not be issued the medal.

　　关于颁发华北解放纪念章的几个问题
    编者按：最近我们收到很多读者来信询问有关颁发华北解放纪念章的问题，现特综合答复如下。
    问：在华北参加抗日战争的部队人员，是否可领取华北解放纪念章？
    答：颁发华北解放纪念章规定中，“解放战争”时间的计算，应包括抗日战争时期和解放战争时期。在华北参加抗日战争者，亦应根据规定条件，发给纪念章。
    问：华北地方工作人员兼部队职务或参加军事管制委员会者，是否亦应发给纪念章？
    答：凡在华北解放前，华北地区的中共地委书记兼军分区政治委员，中共县（区）委书记、县（区）长兼县（区）队政治委员或队长及脱离生产专职之区以上的武装工作委员会工作人员，应与地方武装部队工作人员同样计算，根据规定条例发给纪念章。地方工作人员参加华北各地军事管制委员会工作而未正式入伍者，不算部队建制人员，不应发给纪念章。
    问：原在华北部队工作之女同志，后因故转业、脱离工作为随军家属或回家者，是否应发给纪念章？
    答：华北解放前在华北部队工作有一年以上军龄的女同志，后因带小孩或疾病、体弱等原因不能随队工作，经组织批准转业或脱离工作为随军家属，以及经组织处理而回家者（开除军籍者不算），均发给纪念章。不符上述条件者不发。
