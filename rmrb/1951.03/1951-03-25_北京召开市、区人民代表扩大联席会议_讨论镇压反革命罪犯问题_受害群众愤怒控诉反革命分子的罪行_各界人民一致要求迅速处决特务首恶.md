[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government convened an expanded joint conference of municipal and district people's representatives, attended by more than 5,500 people, at Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the 24th to discuss the issue of punishing counter-revolutionary criminals. Attendees included representatives from all walks of life in Beijing's municipalities and districts, representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, representatives from major factories, schools, government organs, and representatives from ethnic minorities and religious circles. The conference heard and discussed the report "Thoroughly Eliminate the Destructive Activities of Counter-Revolutionary Elements" given by Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also brought a group of heinous counter-revolutionary criminals who had been arrested to the venue, listed their crimes, and had citizens and their families who had suffered persecution from them make accusations on the spot. Representatives from all walks of life unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish these criminals and resolutely support the government in implementing the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries.

		Mayor Peng Zhen Speaks

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke first. He explained that today's meeting was the largest representative conference ever held in Beijing. The purpose of this conference was to discuss the issue of punishing a group of counter-revolutionary criminals, which is a very important issue. He pointed out that the Chinese people currently have three main struggle tasks: first, to oppose imperialism and deeply develop the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. He said: "If the Resist America, Aid Korea work is not done well, then all our economic and cultural construction and other work will be difficult to carry out smoothly. We will hold a national people's Resist America, Aid Korea parade and demonstration on May 1st this year to ensure that every place and every person in the country receives self-education on Resist America, Aid Korea and participates in this movement." Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out that the second struggle task of the Chinese people is to carry out land reform. Last winter, 120 million agricultural people across the country were allocated land. This winter and next spring, land reform can be basically completed throughout the country. He said: "This is a very important matter. After the elimination of feudalism, there will be favorable conditions for development in politics, economy, and culture, and there will be a foundation for democratization and industrialization." The third struggle task, he emphasized, is to suppress counter-revolutionary activities. He said: "Everyone knows that without defeating American imperialism and overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, there would be no victory today. However, it should also be clear that without suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionary remnants, we cannot consolidate the victory we have already obtained." Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out: To consolidate the victory of the revolution, the most important task is to suppress counter-revolutionaries. He severely warned: "If we become arrogant, complacent, and numb due to victory, and the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is not done well, we cannot consolidate the victory of the revolution, we cannot guarantee the safety of people's lives and property, and we cannot guarantee the smooth progress of various construction undertakings." He said: "Resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a question of what attitude we should take towards the enemy, and it is a question of whether we are seriously protecting the fruits of victory and seriously protecting the interests of the people themselves. This is a fundamental issue in the people's democratic dictatorship." Finally, he explained that the people and cadres in Beijing, especially the public security departments and military departments, have done a lot of work and achieved great results in suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the past, but there are also serious shortcomings and errors. He pointed out: The main shortcomings are boundless leniency and untimely suppression. Therefore, he said: "Now we must correct these shortcomings and errors. Only in this way can we consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital, protect the safety of the people of the capital, and protect the safety of various departments and leaders of the Central People's Government."

		Director Luo Ruiqing's Report

Subsequently, Director Luo Ruiqing reported on a batch of counter-revolutionary cases recently cleared up (the full text of the report will be issued separately), and detailed the counter-revolutionary crimes of the key culprits who have been carrying out counter-revolution for a long time, the elements who have continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities without repentance after liberation, the bandit leaders, the despots, and the reactionary secret society spies and leaders, and asked the representatives to discuss. He explained that the People's Government has always combined suppression with leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements, and it is still the same now, that is, resolutely suppressing those who should be suppressed and being lenient to those who should be lenient. Finally, he gave a clear explanation of the concerns that mass reporting and accusations would wrongly accuse good people and implicate innocent people.

When Director Luo reported on the bloody crimes of counter-revolutionary criminals slaughtering and persecuting the people, the entire venue erupted in successive angry calls and slogans demanding that the government severely suppress counter-revolutionaries. The voices of more than 5,000 representatives shook the entire venue, repeatedly interrupting Director Luo's report. They shouted: "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries! Support the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries! Assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries! Shoot important spies! Shoot bandit leaders and habitual bandits! Shoot despots! Shoot leaders of reactionary secret societies!"

		Accusations by Victims

The meeting accepted the demands of citizens and their families who had been persecuted to accuse counter-revolutionary criminals on the spot, and brought these counter-revolutionary criminals to the venue one by one. Those accused on the spot included Wang Fengchao, a military intelligence agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, Lu Huanzhong and Lu Huanshan, Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) agents and local tyrants known as "North Tyrant", Shi Yuling, a local tyrant in the western suburbs, Ma Zhenyuan, Leng Shaoying, and Chen Zidan, CBS agents, Wang Tingshu, local tyrant nicknamed "South Tyrant", military intelligence agent Zhao Zhenlun, Zhang Minzhi, deputy director of the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters and military intelligence agent, Tian Feng, a CBS agent who infiltrated the Fengtai Locomotive Factory to carry out sabotage, Li Tiebao, a traitor and agent, Yang Jinfang, a CBS agent and local tyrant, and Tang Shaoqian, a leader of the Yiguandao sect and local tyrant in the eastern suburbs.

Seventeen people who had been tortured and persecuted by these counter-revolutionary criminals came out to accuse them, including workers Li Yonglu, Wang Wenxiu, Wang Fa, Sun Hongquan, Wang Yuzhong, Wen Yongjiu, farmers Wang Zhanlong, Fan Zhong, Shang Linshi, Gao Deqiang, Professor Xu Yingchao from the Normal University, and former university and middle school students Qiu Xien, Liu Pengzhi, Meng Xiangong, He Jianzhang, and Deng Xiao. When they made their accusations, they gnashed their teeth and spoke with tears in their eyes. They listed the bloody crimes of these secret agents and bandits and unanimously demanded that the People's Government immediately shoot these heinous counter-revolutionary criminals to avenge the dead and persecuted compatriots. The venue continuously erupted with roars of "Shoot important spies! Shoot bandit leaders and habitual bandits! Shoot despots! Shoot leaders of reactionary secret societies! Avenge the people! Avenge the revolutionary martyrs!"

		Speeches by Representatives from All Walks of Life

Demands for accusations continued one after another, but the accusations had to be stopped because it was late. Finally, Zhang Manyun, representative of the China Democratic League, Sister Wei Xiuting of the Catholic Chinese Joseph Sisters' Congregation, Zhang Xianting, representative of the industrial and commercial circles, and Zhou Peiyuan, professor of Tsinghua University, spoke. Zhang Manyun said: "Just now, I heard the comrades who were victimized accuse the special agents and despots of their crimes, and I felt infinite hatred in my heart. To consolidate the people's regime and let the people live a happy life, we must support the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries and severely suppress the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandits. I hope everyone will be more vigilant so that special agents cannot sneak into our ranks!" Catholic nun Wei Xiuting said: "Chairman Mao's leadership is correct. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is in the interests of every person and vents anger for the people. Chairman Mao is truly a good leader who seeks happiness for the people." Zhang Xianting said: "On behalf of the industrial and commercial circles, I ask the government to severely punish these counter-revolutionary elements. Those who should be killed should be killed, and those who should be imprisoned should be imprisoned. We believe that after the gradual elimination of counter-revolutionary elements, our industry and commerce will be able to develop more steadily." Zhou Peiyuan said: "All teachers and students of Tsinghua guarantee that we will use actions to support the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We must always be vigilant and pay close attention to the activities of counter-revolutionaries. Everyone should take on the task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries!"

		Director Wang Feiran's Speech

After the representatives spoke, Wang Feiran, Director of the Military Law Office of the Beijing Military Control Commission and concurrently President of the Beijing People's Court, spoke. He said: "After this group of heinous counter-revolutionary elements were handed over to the Military Law Office by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, we stepped up our work and conducted trials. Now, the results of the trials are that the evidence is conclusive and the case is as solid as a mountain. Why has it not been dealt with until now? Because the matter is very important, we wanted to discuss it with everyone again, so we brought it to the conference for discussion. Today, all the representatives unanimously demanded severe suppression. Everyone in the country said they should be killed. The Military Law Office will not hesitate at all, and dare not hesitate. After returning today, we will work overnight to complete all the legal procedures and execute them tomorrow." He said: I hope the representatives will help and supervise the Military Law Office after the meeting so that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries can be done better. At this time, the representatives present applauded enthusiastically and cheered.

		Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech

Finally, Mayor Peng Zhen spoke. He said: Everyone has been here for four or five hours today, and you are probably a little tired. However, I still have a few words to discuss with everyone in the end. Just now, Director Luo reported and everyone accused, there is such a group of bad people: there are special agent leaders who used machine guns to kill more than 1,000 people, there are special agent black gunners who set fire to more than 1,000 houses and killed more than 400 revolutionary people, and there are special agent leaders who have robbed many times and prepared to riot after liberation. Representatives, comrades, what should we do with important spies, bandit leaders, habitual bandits, despots, and reactionary secret society leaders? (All the representatives shouted in unison: "Shoot them!") Everyone's opinion is very correct, they should be shot (enthusiastic applause). Should we be lenient to them? (All the representatives said again in unison: "We shouldn't!") Yes, we shouldn't be lenient, we can't be lenient anymore! If we are lenient to these people again, it will be the fault of the People's Government, and even a crime.

Someone asked: Is it cruel to shoot these special agent leaders, despots, bandit leaders, habitual bandits, and reactionary secret society leaders? (All representatives: "It's not cruel!") Yes, it's not cruel! It is the greatest kindness. Does anyone think that a counter-revolutionary element killing more than a thousand people is not cruel? Not hateful?! Is it not cruel or hateful for a special agent black gunner to burn down more than 1,000 houses and kill more than 400 cadres and masses?! Is it not cruel or hateful that special agent bandits killed more than 4,000 government workers in Guangxi?! Now we want to shoot these heinous special agent leaders, despots, bandit leaders, habitual bandits, and reactionary secret society leaders to eliminate harm for the people, avenge the people, and protect the interests and safety of the broad masses of the people. They think it is cruel and want us to be "kind", that is, to be infinitely more lenient! Representatives! Comrades! Are they right? Or are we right? (All representatives shouted: "We are right!" and shouted slogans: "Support the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries!" "Support Mayor Peng!" "Long live Chairman Mao!") Representatives, comrades, thank you for your trust, we will definitely do it according to your wishes. (All the representatives shouted in unison: "Support the Municipal People's Government!" "Long live the People's Government!")

Comrades, we were elected by everyone and entrusted by everyone. We are everyone's servants, we are people's servants under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We will definitely do what you want to do; we will definitely not do what you don't approve of. (All the representatives shouted in unison: "Thank you for your wise leadership!" "Long live Chairman Mao!")

What is our standard for suppressing counter-revolutionaries? At the last expanded meeting of the People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, I talked about and discussed with you that we take the facts of the crimes of each counter-revolutionary element and the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government as the standard. According to this principle, those who should be killed will be sentenced to death; not one will be killed who should not be killed. Those who can be killed or not can be killed, and we will not kill them either. However, we will not tolerate those who should be killed and must be killed. All will be punished according to law. Those who should be imprisoned will be imprisoned; those who should be controlled will be controlled; without this, we will not have the safety of the people, the people's regime cannot be consolidated, and the victory of the revolution cannot be consolidated. The eyes of the People's Government are the brightest, because the eyes of the people are the brightest. Our sentencing is placed on the scales, those with serious crimes will be severely punished; those with minor crimes will be lightly punished; of course, those who sincerely repent or perform meritorious service while serving their sentences and should be given leniency will still be given leniency. In the past, we made mistakes in this regard: those who should have been suppressed were not suppressed; those who were suppressed were not suppressed in a timely manner. Now we must correct these errors according to the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries".

Director Wang Feiran just said that the Public Security Bureau and the Military Law Office have carefully, thoroughly, and repeatedly studied these cases many times. The People's Representative Conference and the Consultative Committee have also studied them several times. All legal procedures have been prepared, waiting to discuss with everyone before handling them. Now that everyone unanimously advocates suppression, the court will pronounce and execute the sentence tomorrow. (All the representatives cheered enthusiastically and applauded, the applause lasting for a long time.) Please go back and tell the victims who have been harmed by special agent bandits that we will definitely avenge them. (All the representatives shouted one after another: "Support the People's Government!" "Long live Chairman Mao!")

Representatives, comrades, during this period, we have heard criticisms from all sides from compatriots from all walks of life, saying that the government is "infinitely lenient", "it is simply not like a people's government to be so lenient to special agents"; saying that "the government is asleep and does not make decisions for the people." Please tell them after you go back that their criticisms are correct, and we accept them all. Our Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China. We will never allow any counter-revolutionary elements to operate here. Our Municipal People's Government is willing to unite with compatriots from all walks of life and with all the representatives to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants in order to consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital.

　　北京召开市、区人民代表扩大联席会议
    讨论镇压反革命罪犯问题 
    受害群众愤怒控诉反革命分子的罪行
    各界人民一致要求迅速处决特务首恶
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府二十四日在中山公园音乐堂召开五千五百多人的市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议，讨论惩治反革命罪犯问题。到会的有北京市市、区各界人民代表，各民主党派和人民团体代表，各大工厂、学校、机关及少数民族和宗教界代表。会议听取并讨论了北京市公安局罗瑞卿兼局长所作的《彻底肃清反革命分子破坏活动》的报告。市公安局并将已逮捕的一批罪大恶极的反革命罪犯押到会场，列举出他们的罪状，由遭受他们迫害的市民及家属当场进行控诉。到会各界代表一致要求人民政府严厉惩办这些罪犯，坚决拥护政府执行惩治反革命条例。
            彭真市长讲话
    彭真市长首先讲话。他说明今天的会是北京市规模最大的一次代表会议。这个会议是要讨论惩治一批反革命罪犯的问题，这是一个极大的问题。他指出当前的中国人民有三个主要的斗争任务，第一是反对帝国主义，深入展开抗美援朝运动。他说：“如果抗美援朝这项工作做得不好，那么，我们的一切经济文化建设等工作都难顺利进行。我们在今年五月一日将举行全国人民抗美援朝游行示威，要使全国每一处每一个人都受到抗美援朝的自我教育，都参加这个运动。”彭真市长指出中国人民的第二个斗争任务，是进行土地改革。去年冬季全国有一亿二千万农业人口分得了土地，今冬明春，全国土地改革就可以基本上完成。他说：“这是一件极大的事情。消灭封建以后，在政治、经济、文化各方面的发展就有了顺利条件，民主化、工业化就有了基础。”第三个斗争任务，他强调指出，就是镇压反革命活动。他说：“谁都晓得，不打走美帝国主义，不打倒蒋介石匪帮，不会有今天的胜利。但是，还应该明白，不镇压反革命活动，不彻底肃清反革命残余，就不能巩固今天已得到的胜利。”彭真市长指出：要巩固革命的胜利，最重要的一项工作就是镇压反革命。他严重地警告：“假如我们因为胜利而骄傲轻敌、麻木不仁，镇压反革命的工作做得不好，就不能巩固革命胜利，不能保障人民生命财产的安全，不能保障各项建设事业的顺利进行。”他说：“坚决镇压反革命问题，就是我们对待敌人应该采取什么态度的问题，就是我们是不是认真保护胜利果实，是不是认真保护人民自己利益的问题。这是人民民主专政中的一个根本问题。”最后他说明北京市的人民和各方面干部，特别是公安部门、军事部门过去在镇压反革命问题上做了许多工作，有很大成绩，但是也有严重的缺点和错误。他指出：主要缺点是宽大无边和镇压不及时。因此他说：“现在我们必须改正这些缺点和错误。只有这样，才能巩固首都的革命秩序，保卫首都人民的安全，保卫中央人民政府各部门和各首长的安全。”
            罗瑞卿兼局长报告
    继由罗瑞卿兼局长报告最近清理出来的一批反革命案件（报告全文另发），并详细列举长期进行反革命的首恶分子、解放后仍然怙恶不悛继续作反革命活动的分子、匪首、恶霸及反动道会门特务道首的反革命罪状，请到会代表讨论。他说明，人民政府对待反革命分子，从来就是镇压与宽大相结合，现在也还是这样，就是坚决镇压那些应该镇压的，宽大那些应该宽大的。最后，他对于顾虑群众检举告密会冤枉好人、牵连无辜的问题作了明晰的解释。
    当罗兼局长报告反革命罪犯屠杀人民、残害人民的血腥罪行时，全场爆发了此起彼落的愤怒呼声和要求政府严厉镇压反革命的口号。五千多到会代表的声音，震撼了整个会场，接连打断了罗兼局长的报告。他们高呼：“坚决镇压反革命！拥护惩治反革命条例！协助政府肃清反革命！枪毙重要特务！枪毙匪首惯匪！枪毙恶霸！枪毙反动道会门头子！”
            受迫害者控诉
    会议接受曾经遭受迫害的市民及家属当场控诉反革命罪犯的要求，并将这批反革命罪犯依次押到会场，当场被控诉的有蒋介石匪帮军统特务王凤巢，中统特务、北郊恶霸“北霸天”路焕仲、路焕山，西郊恶霸史玉龄，中统特务马振源、冷少颖、陈子丹，南郊恶霸“南霸天”、“阎王爷”王廷枢，军统特务赵振纶，国民党北平市党部副主委、军统特务张民治，混入丰台机车厂进行破坏的中统特务田丰，汉奸、特务李铁宝，中统特务、恶霸杨金芳，一贯道头子、东郊恶霸唐绍谦。
    曾经被这些反革命罪犯摧残迫害，出来控诉的，计有工人李永禄、王文秀、王发、孙鸿全、王玉忠、温永久，农民王占龙、范忠、尚林氏、高德强，师大教授徐英超和过去在校的大、中学生邱锡恩、刘鹏志、孟宪功、贺建章、邓霄等十七人。他们在控诉时，咬牙切齿，声泪俱下。他们历数这些特务匪徒的血腥罪状，一致要求人民政府立即枪毙这些罪大恶极的反革命罪犯，为死难及遭受迫害的同胞报仇。会场上不断发出“枪毙重要特务！枪毙匪首惯匪！枪毙恶霸！枪毙反动道会门头子！为人民报仇！为革命烈士报仇！”的怒吼。
            各界代表发言
    要求控诉的接连不断，但因为时间已晚，不能不中止控诉。最后由中国民主同盟代表张曼筠、天主教中华若瑟修女会修女卫秀蓂、工商界代表张献庭、清华大学教授周培源发言。张曼筠说：“刚才我听到被害的同志们控诉特务和恶霸的罪行，心里感到无限的愤恨。我们要巩固人民政权，要人民过幸福日子，那我们就要拥护惩治反革命条例严厉镇压美蒋特务匪徒。希望大家提高警觉，使特务钻不进我们队伍来！”天主教修女卫秀蓂说：“毛主席的领导是正确的，镇压反革命，是每一个人民的利益，也为人民出了气。毛主席真是为人民谋幸福的好领袖。”张献庭说：“我代表工商界要求政府严厉惩治这些反革命分子，该杀的杀，该关的关。我们相信反革命分子逐步肃清后，我们工商业就更能稳步发展。”周培源说：“我们清华全体师生保证，要用行动来支持政府镇压反革命的政策。我们一定随时提高警惕，严密注意反革命的活动，每个人把镇压反革命的工作都担当起来！”
            王斐然处长讲话
    代表发言之后，北京市军事管制委员会军法处处长兼北京市人民法院院长王斐然讲话。他说：“所有这一批罪大恶极的反革命分子，从北京市人民政府公安局解到军法处后，我们就加紧工作，进行审理。现在审理的结果，都是证据确凿，铁案如山。为什么到现在还没有处理？因为事情很大，想再和大家商量，所以提到大会上来讨论。今天，全体代表一致要求严厉镇压，国人皆曰可杀，军法处丝毫不犹豫，也不敢犹豫。今天回去以后，漏夜工作，办好一切法律手续，明天就把他们枪决。”他说：希望代表们在会议后，帮助和督促军法处，把镇压反革命的工作做得更好。这时，到会代表一致热烈鼓掌，一片欢声。
            彭真市长讲话
    最后彭真市长讲话。他说：今天大家在这里开了四、五个钟头的会，大概有点累了。但是，最后我还有几句话，和大家商量。刚才罗局长报告的和大家控诉的，有这样一批坏人：有用机关枪杀死一千多人的特务头子，有放火烧毁一千多户民房、杀死四百多革命人民的特务黑枪手，有解放以后行抢多次和准备暴动的特务头子。代表们，同志们，对于重要特务、匪首、惯匪、恶霸、反动会道门头子，我们应该怎么办呢？（全体代表不约而同地高喊：“枪毙！”）大家的意见很对，应该枪毙（热烈鼓掌）。对他们还应不应该宽大？（全体代表又不约而同地说：“不应该！”）是的，不应宽大，不能宽大了！如果对这些人再宽大，那就是人民政府的错误，甚至是罪恶了。
    有人问：枪毙这些特务头子、恶霸、匪首、惯匪、反动会道门头子，算不算残忍？（全体代表：“不是残忍！”）是的，不是残忍！乃是最大的仁慈。有人觉得一个反革命分子杀一千多人民，不算残忍？不算可恨？！一个特务黑枪手烧毁一千多间民房打死四百多干部和群众不算残忍？！不算可恨？在广西特务匪徒杀害政府工作人员四千多也不算残忍？！不算可恨？！现在我们要枪毙这些罪大恶极、死有余辜的特务头子、恶霸、匪首、惯匪、反动会道门头子，来为人民除害，为人民报仇雪恨，来保护广大人民的利益和安全，他们反倒认为是残忍，要我们“仁慈”些，就是再宽大得无边些！代表们！同志们！到底是他们对？还是我们对？（全体代表高呼：“我们对！”高呼口号：“拥护人民政府坚决镇压反革命！”“拥护彭市长！”“毛主席万岁！”）代表们，同志们，谢谢你们的信任，我们一定按照你们的意见办。（全体代表一齐高呼：“拥护市人民政府！”“人民政府万岁！”）
    同志们，我们是大家选举出来的，是大家委派的。我们是大家的勤务员，我们是在毛主席领导下的人民勤务员。你们大家要办的事，我们一定办；你们不赞成办的事，我们一定不办。（全体代表一齐高呼：“感谢英明的领导！”“毛主席万岁！”）
    我们镇压反革命，拿什么作标准呢？上次在各界人民代表会议协商委员会的扩大会议上，我曾经和大家讲过、商议过，我们是以各个反革命分子的犯罪的事实和中央人民政府颁布的“惩治反革命条例”为标准。根据这样的原则，该杀的，即判处死刑；不该杀的，一个也不杀。可以杀、可以不杀的，我们也不杀。但是，该杀的，必须杀的，我们一个也不纵容，通通依法治罪。该监禁的，监禁；该管制的，管制；不这样，就没有我们人民的安全，人民政权就不能巩固，革命的胜利就不能巩固。人民政府的眼睛是最亮的，因为人民的眼睛是最亮的。我们量刑是放在天秤上的，罪重的重办；罪轻的轻办；当然，诚心悔过，或戴罪立功，因而应该受到宽大的，还是要宽大。以前我们在这个问题上曾犯过错误：应该镇压的，没有镇压；镇压了的，也不及时。现在要根据“惩治反革命条例”，纠正这些错误。
    王斐然处长刚才讲过，公安局和军法处对于这次案件，已经审慎地、详细地、反复地研究过多少次。各界人民代表会议和协商委员会，也研究过几次。一切法律手续已经准备好，等着和大家商量后就办，现在大家既然都一致主张镇压，明天法庭就宣判、执行。（全体代表热烈欢呼，大鼓掌，掌声经久不息。）请大家回去告诉曾受特务匪徒残害的苦主们，我们一定给他们报仇雪恨。（全体代表纷纷高喊：“拥护人民政府！”“毛主席万岁！”）
    代表们，同志们，这个时期我们曾从各方面听到各界同胞的批评，说政府“宽大无边”，“对特务这样宽大简直不像个人民政府的样子”；说“政府睡着了，不给人民作主”。请你们回去之后告诉他们，他们的批评是对的，我们通通接受。我们北京是中华人民共和国的首都。我们决不允许有任何反革命分子在此活动。我们市人民政府愿意和各界同胞，和各位代表们，团结起来，坚决、彻底、干净，全部肃清反革命残余，以巩固首都的革命秩序。
