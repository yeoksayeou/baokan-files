Implementing the "Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries"
       Zhou Xinmin

　　The people's democratic dictatorship is a government established by the Chinese working class and its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party—and Chairman Mao, leading the broad masses of the Chinese people in a long, arduous, heroic, and unparalleled struggle against reactionary forces such as imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, sacrificing the heads of countless martyrs and the lives of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, and overthrowing the reactionary rule of the feudal, comprador, fascist Kuomintang. To consolidate and develop this victorious achievement, we should undoubtedly and resolutely suppress counterrevolutionary acts that undermine our people's regime and democratic cause, and all acts that endanger the interests of the country and the people. This is not a temporary expedient, but a long-term and arduous political task that the people's democratic dictatorship state must complete. Chairman Mao has given us clear instructions in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and the report of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We not only have the objective conditions for completing this political task, but also the guiding principles for completing this political task.

　　However, since US imperialism openly launched armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, domestic counterrevolutionary elements have become more rampant, believing that there was an opportunity to exploit. Under the active support and instigation of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, they have continuously organized special agent forces in various places, plotting riots, stealing intelligence, spreading rumors to confuse the public, and openly killing people and people's cadres, undermining economic construction, and harming the people's regime and democratic cause in every possible way. Although we have given them many blows and sanctions, the principle of combining suppression and leniency has not been well implemented, and there has been an excessive tendency towards leniency in many places, which has not yet been completely corrected. Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government, Minister of Justice Shi Liang, and the People's Daily editorial on February 22 have given clear analyses and profound criticisms of the political influence and ideological origins of this tendency. To ensure that the policy of suppressing counterrevolutionaries can be resolutely and correctly implemented throughout the country in the future, and to provide cadres and the masses with legal weapons to suppress counterrevolutionary activities and to provide judges with sentencing standards for handling counterrevolutionary criminals, the promulgation of these "Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries" not only meets the demands of the broad masses of the people, but also meets the needs of the current objective situation.

　　What is the legislative principle of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries? It is formulated based on the spirit of combining suppression and leniency in Article 7 of the Common Program; that is, it is formulated based on the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who are coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service." The Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries first explicitly stipulate that the principles of severe punishment or heavier punishment should be adopted for the chief elements, masterminds, commanders, organizers, and those with serious crimes and serious circumstances; for those who are coerced or deceived by counterrevolutionary elements and are truly involuntary (Article 14, Paragraph 3), the principle of lenient treatment should be adopted. The former shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment; the latter shall be given reduced sentences or exemption from punishment. These provisions are extremely fair and reasonable.

　　Secondly, the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries affirm that the principle of severe punishment or heavier punishment should be adopted for counterrevolutionary elements who continue to be enemies of the people after liberation; for those whose counterrevolutionary crimes before liberation were not serious, and who have truly repented after liberation and broken ties with counterrevolutionary organizations (Article 14, Paragraph 4), the principle of lenient treatment should be adopted. This is also extremely fair and most reasonable. The Central People's Government has been established for nearly a year and a half. During this year and a half, the government has given counterrevolutionary elements before liberation sincere opportunities to confess or redeem their crimes through meritorious service. They should have automatically repented and started anew long ago. However, some counterrevolutionary elements have remained unrepentant and still dare to continue to be enemies of the people. The government should impose severe punishment on them. Therefore, the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries, on the one hand, treat the stubborn and heinous counterrevolutionary elements with the spirit of eradicating evil, and punish them with the crimes they deserve; on the other hand, for "those who sincerely confess to the People's Government and repent," and "those who sincerely repent and perform meritorious service to redeem their crimes before or after exposure and reporting," they are given opportunities to reform themselves in the spirit of leniency. This shows that we still combine the spirit of leniency under the principle of severely suppressing counterrevolutionaries, which means that our suppression is principled and has "boundaries"; our leniency is also principled and has "boundaries."

　　The accurate implementation of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries is not a task that can be completed solely by public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs. All ethnic groups, classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and even all people across the country must unanimously support and study them, and effectively help the government to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against counterrevolutionary elements, and assume the responsibility of exposure and reporting, in order to complete this important task. Counterrevolutionary elements have never been reconciled to their own demise. Marshal Stalin once said: "The more the power of the state grows, the more fierce the resistance of the remnants of the dying class." Chairman Mao also said: "After the open, visible, and armed enemies are defeated, the hidden, invisible, and unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us." The people of the whole country should deeply remember these famous sayings of the two revolutionary teachers, and report to the government at any time and any place all counterrevolutionary elements who endanger the people, and give them comprehensive, thorough, and merciless blows. This will not only guarantee the accurate implementation of the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries, but also provide favorable conditions for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and developing the construction of the new China.

　　贯彻实施“惩治反革命条例”
       周新民 
    人民民主专政的政权，是由中国工人阶级及其先锋队——中国共产党——和毛主席领导广大的中国人民与帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义等反动势力作长期艰苦卓绝英勇无比的斗争，牺牲了无数先烈的头颅和中华民族的优秀儿女的生命，推翻了封建买办法西斯的国民党反动统治，而建立起来的。我们为巩固发展这胜利成果，对破坏我们人民政权和民主事业，以及一切危害国家人民利益的反革命行为，无疑地应予以坚决彻底的镇压。这不是一时的权宜措施，而是人民民主专政国家所必须完成的长期艰巨的政治任务。毛主席在《论人民民主专政》和中国共产党第七届第三次中央委员会全体会议的报告中，已给我们作了明确的指示，我们不但有了完成这一政治任务的客观条件，而且也有了完成这一政治任务的指导方针。
    可是自从美帝国主义公开武装侵略朝鲜和台湾以后，国内反革命分子认为有机可乘，是更加猖獗了：在美帝国主义和蒋匪积极支持主使之下，不断地在各地组织特务武装，阴谋暴动，窃取情报，造谣惑众，以及公开杀害人民和人民干部，破坏经济建设，无孔不入地危害了人民政权和民主事业。我们虽曾给以不少的打击和制裁，但因镇压与宽大相结合的方针，没有很好地贯彻，曾有很多地方发生了过分宽大的偏向，到现在还未完全纠正过来。关于这种偏向的政治影响和思想根源，中央人民政府政治法律委员会彭真副主任和司法部史良部长以及人民日报二月二十二日社论，已给予明确的分析，和深刻的批判。为了保证今后在全国各地能够坚决地正确地贯彻镇压反革命的政策，并给予干部和群众镇压反革命活动以法律武器及审判者处理反革命案犯以量刑标准，这《惩治反革命条例》的颁行，不但满足了广大人民的要求，同时也适应目前客观情势的需要。
    惩治反革命条例的立法原则是什么？它是根据共同纲领第七条镇压与宽大相结合的精神而制定的；也就是根据“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策而制定的。惩治反革命条例首先明文规定了对于反革命的首要分子，主谋者，指挥者，组织者，以及罪恶重大者，情节重大者，均采取严厉处罚或从重处罚的原则；对于被反革命分子胁迫、欺骗、确非自愿者（十四条三款），则采取从轻处理的原则。前者均处以死刑或无期徒刑；后者则予以减刑或免刑，这些规定是极公平合理的。
    其次，惩治反革命条例肯定了对于解放后继续与人民为敌的反革命分子，是采取严厉处罚或从重处罚的原则；对于解放前反革命罪行并不重大，解放后又确已悔改，并与反革命组织断绝联系的分子（十四条四款），则采取从宽处理的原则，这也是极公平而且最合理的。中央人民政府成立将近一年半，在这一年半的期间内，政府处处给解放前的反革命分子以真诚自首或立功赎罪的机会，他们早应自动悔过，从新做人。可是，有些反革命分子，始终执迷不悟，仍敢继续与人民为敌，政府自应予以严厉处罚。所以惩治反革命条例一面对冥顽不化，罪大恶极的反革命分子，则本诸除恶务尽的精神，治以应得之罪；一面对于“自动向人民政府真诚自首悔过者”，以及“在揭发、检举前或以后真诚悔过立功赎罪者”，则本着宽大的精神，给以自新机会，这正说明我们在严厉镇压反革命的原则下，还是结合着宽大精神，也就是说明我们镇压是有原则的，有“边”的；我们宽大，也是有原则的，有“边”的。
    确切实施惩治反革命条例，不是公安、检察、审判等机关所能单独完成任务的，必须全国各民族、各阶层、各民主党派、各人民团体，乃至全体人民一致地拥护和学习，并切实帮助政府向反革命分子作坚决无情的斗争，负起揭发检举的责任，才能完成这一重大的任务。反革命分子从来不甘心自己的死亡。斯大林大元帅曾经说过：“国家威力越增长，垂死阶级余孽的抵抗也愈猛烈。”毛主席也曾说过：“在公开的，有形的，拿枪的敌人被打倒之后，隐蔽的，无形的，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，而且必然要和我们作拚死的斗争。”全国人民，应该深刻地记住这两位革命导师的名言，随时随地向政府告发一切危害人民的反革命分子，给以全面的彻底的无情打击，这样就不但保证了惩治反革命条例的确切实施，同时也为巩固人民民主专政和发展新中国建设提供了有利条件。
