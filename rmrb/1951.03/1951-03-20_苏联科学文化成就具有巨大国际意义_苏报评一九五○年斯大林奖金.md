Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th dispatch from TASS: *Pravda* and *Izvestia* published editorials commenting on the Soviet Council of Ministers' decision to award the 1950 Stalin Prizes. The *Pravda* editorial stated: "The awarding of the Stalin Prizes is another vivid demonstration of the significant achievements of advanced Soviet science and culture. Soviet scientists are victoriously fulfilling the task put forward by Stalin—to catch up with and surpass the achievements of foreign science in the near future. Soviet scientists, engineers, and inventors not only maintain but also carry forward the glorious traditions of the advanced figures in the motherland's scientific and technological circles. During the era of Soviet power, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin party, the Soviet Union has become a true fortress and disseminator of advanced science. The achievements of Soviet science and culture have immense international significance, showing the world the great creative power of the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology." The editorial emphasized that the awarding of the Stalin Prizes inspires the workers in Soviet science, industry, agriculture, art, and literature to engage in creative labor for the glory of the motherland and the victory of communism.

The *Izvestia* editorial stated: "In the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers regarding the awarding of the Stalin Prizes, the list of those who have won awards for outstanding inventions and improvements in production methods is the largest. The achievements of innovators in production methods fully demonstrate that the Soviet system has opened up unlimited prospects for the steady development of technology. The tasks facing inventors are increasing year by year, and ordinary working people with technology and experience are also participating in creative work in technology in increasing numbers each year. In many cases, workers and outstanding scientists are jointly making the most important inventions. These facts vividly demonstrate that the cooperation between scientists and workers is increasing day by day, and the differences between mental and physical labor are being eliminated."

    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报与消息报发表社论，评论苏联部长会议关于颁发一九五○年斯大林奖金的决定。真理报社论说：颁发斯大林奖金是先进的苏维埃科学与文化获得重大成就的又一生动证明。苏联科学家正在胜利地完成斯大林所提出的任务——要在最近之将来赶上并超过外国科学的成就。苏联的科学家、工程师与发明者不仅保持而且还发扬了祖国科学与技术界先进人物的光荣传统。在苏维埃政权的年代中，在列宁——斯大林党的领导下，苏联已成为先进科学的真正堡垒与传播者。苏联的科学与文化的成就具有巨大的国际意义，它向全世界显示了战无不胜的马克思——列宁主义思想的伟大的创造力量。社论强调称：斯大林奖金的颁发鼓舞着苏联科学、工业、农业、艺术与文学工作者，为了祖国的光荣和共产主义的胜利而进行创造性的劳动。
    消息报社论说：在苏联部长会议关于颁发斯大林奖金的决定中，因卓越的发明与改进生产方法而获奖的名单最大。生产方法革新者的成就充分表明了苏维埃制度已为技术的稳步发展打开了无限的前途。发明者所面临的任务正年年增多，拥有技术和经验的普通劳动人民也逐年加多地参加到技术方面的创造性的工作中来。在许多场合下，工人与卓越的科学家是共同作出最重要的发明的。这些事实生动地表明了科学家与工人之间的合作正在日益增加，脑力与体力劳动之间的差异正在消灭。
