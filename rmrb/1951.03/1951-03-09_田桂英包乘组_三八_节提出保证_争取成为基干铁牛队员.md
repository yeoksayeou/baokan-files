　　Tian Guiying Package Crew Makes "March 8th" Pledge
    Striving to Become Basic Iron Ox Team Members
    The "March 8th" locomotive female driver Tian Guiying package crew of the Dalian Locomotive Depot of the Changchun Railway, who are formal Iron Ox team members, proposed to run safely for 100,000 kilometers in order to welcome the "March 8th" festival and strive to become basic Iron Ox team members. Since they started working on the locomotive last "March 8th," the "March 8th" locomotive they drive has never had an accident. Up to now, it has run safely for more than 62,000 kilometers, prevented ten accidents, saved 37.5 kilograms of engine oil, and saved more than 49 tons of coal. In addition to their own driving business, they also humbly learn maintenance techniques. Now they have learned to repair water meters, steam meters, etc. This plays a big role in maintaining locomotives and preventing accidents. For example, once when Wang Baohong of the group was driving train No. 114, the water feeder suddenly broke down. However, Wang Baohong and the deputy driver Dai Shuzhen and the fireman Li Wenyu repaired it while driving, and as a result, the train still arrived at Dalian Station safely and on time. Because their technology is already skilled, the superiors often send them to drive long-distance passenger trains with larger slopes between Dalian and Dashiqiao. In addition, in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, they also launched a challenge competition to the entire section, driving all eight locomotives in the section to become formal Iron Ox team members.

　　田桂英包乘组“三八”节提出保证
    争取成为基干铁牛队员
    正式铁牛队员，中长铁路大连机务段“三八号”机车女司机田桂英包乘组，为了迎接“三八”节日，提出要安全运行十万公里，争取做基干铁牛队员。自从她们去年“三八”开始上车以来，她们所驾驶的“三八号”机车一直没有发生过事故，直到现在已安全运行了六万二千余公里，防止了十件事故，并节省机油三十七公斤半，省煤四十九吨多。除了开车本身的业务外，她们还虚心地学习检修技术。现在她们已学会修理水表、汽表等。这对于保养机车，防止事故，起很大作用。如有一次该组王宝鸿开行一一四次列车时，给水器突然发生故障。但经过王宝鸿和副司机戴淑贞、司炉李雯彧三人一边行车一边修理，结果该次列车仍然安全正点地到达大连站。因为她们的技术已经熟练，上级经常派她们驾驶大连到大石桥间坡度较大的长途旅客列车。此外，在抗美援朝运动中，她们还向全段提出挑战竞赛，带动全段八台机车都成为正式铁牛队员。
