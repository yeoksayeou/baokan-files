In the 24th year of the old Republic of China, in a village called Huangjiachuan, near the mountains in a certain county in Hebei, Xi'er, the daughter of tenant farmer Yang Bailao, was the most outstanding girl in the surrounding villages. Wang Da's son, Dachun, was a hardworking and capable young man. The two families had long been engaged, just waiting for the autumn harvest to get married.

The local bully landlord, Huang Shiren, had long harbored malicious intentions towards Xi'er. One autumn evening, Huang Shiren returned from the city by car and happened to meet Xi'er returning from the fields. Huang Shiren made frivolous advances towards Xi'er, but Xi'er angrily ignored him. Huang Shiren returned home and plotted a sinister scheme with his lackey, Mu Renzhi, planning to use debt collection as a pretext to seize Xi'er at the end of the year.

After the autumn rent was paid, the Yang and Wang families worked desperately, hoping to escape Huang's usurious loans at the end of the year.

As the year drew to a close, they calculated that what they had earned during the winter was enough to pay off the interest to Huang's family. The two families happily prepared to hold their children's wedding on New Year's Day!

On New Year's Eve, Yang Bailao went to Huang's house to pay the interest. Huang Shiren, using the excuse of collecting "both principal and interest," forced Yang Bailao to put his handprint on the contract selling his daughter.

Yang Bailao, seeing his daughter about to fall into a fiery pit, was filled with guilt. Unable to resist, he had no choice but to drink brine and commit suicide.

Xi'er was snatched into Huang's house. Only the image of Dachun and the hope of reuniting in the future supported her to keep living. Unfortunately, one night, she was raped by Huang Shiren. All thoughts of life were destroyed. Xi'er was in utter despair, only seeking a quick death.

Dachun received the news and sneaked into Huang's house at night, wanting to lead Xi'er to escape, but was discovered by the Huang family. Carrying a body full of hatred, Dachun went to find the Red Army on the west bank of the Yellow River in northern Shaanxi.

After Xi'er was raped and became pregnant, the Huang family, fearing the matter would be exposed, plotted to sell Xi'er into prostitution on the night before Huang Shiren's wedding. This was learned by Zhang Er's wife, a maid in the Huang family, who helped Xi'er escape from the tiger's den.

Where could Xi'er escape to? She could only escape to the remote mountains and wilderness. Xi'er lived in a mountain cave, eating raw and cold food. On the first and fifteenth of each month, she would go to the Grandma Temple on the mountainside to steal offerings. The mountain-like weight of hatred and the ghost-like life turned Xi'er's hair completely white. The villagers believed her to be the "White-Haired Immortal."

During the July 7th Incident, the Eighth Route Army went north, and Dachun passed through his hometown and was left in the local area to organize the masses to resist Japan.

Huang Shiren used the "White-Haired Immortal" to spread rumors and sabotage,打击打击the anti-Japanese and rent reduction sentiments of the peasants.

Dachun investigated the truth about the "White-Haired Immortal," personally hiding in the Grandma Temple, and indeed waited for something with white hair. He tracked it to a deep mountain cave and discovered that it was Xi'er. At this point, this tragedy of the old society turning people into ghosts came to an end. In the sunlight, revenge was taken, grievances were redressed, and the new society turned ghosts back into people.
