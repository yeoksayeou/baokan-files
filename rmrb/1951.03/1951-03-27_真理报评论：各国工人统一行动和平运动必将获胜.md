Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 25th, commenting on the united action of the working class in the struggle for peace.

The editorial stated: "The peace movement is expanding more and more widely. The vitality of this movement and its invincibility are due to the fact that it unites hundreds of millions of people from various strata. The working class is the leading force of the peace movement. The international solidarity and united action of workers in all countries, expanded and strengthened in the struggle for peace, are the guarantee that the peace movement will surely triumph. The European Workers' Conference Against the Remilitarization of Germany, currently being held in Berlin, is a manifestation of the international solidarity of the working people."

"The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France have openly embarked on the road of rearming West Germany. The entire economy of West Germany has been shifted to a war footing. As pointed out at the European Workers' Conference, large-scale production of war materials has already begun in West Germany. Seventeen enterprises are already manufacturing aircraft engines and equipment. More than thirty factories are manufacturing tank parts and equipment. Thirty-five enterprises are manufacturing artillery shells. Many other German enterprises are also manufacturing munitions. In the western occupied zones of Germany and West Berlin, fascist mercenary armies are being organized under the guise of police forces, with a strength of approximately 500,000 men."

"The people of the world resolutely protest the remilitarization of West Germany. This sincere desire to thwart the imperialists' plan to rearm West Germany has brought together workers' representatives from eighteen European countries in Berlin. The European proletariat is determined to take the cause of defending European peace into their own hands."

"The concept that the proletariat should unite in the struggle for peace is taking root in the hearts of hundreds of millions of workers. In the entire history of the international workers' movement, the solidarity of the working class has never had such decisive importance as it does today, whether in individual countries or on a world scale."

"The imperialist warmongers know that if the working classes of all countries are united, if the working class consolidates and leads the masses in the struggle for peace, then their attempt to launch another bloody massacre will never succeed. For this reason, the Anglo-American imperialists, with the assistance of their agents—the right-wing social democrats and the Tito fascist bandit gang—are using all their strength to split the workers' movement and to overthrow the strength of the international proletariat. Experience has told us that only by resolutely struggling against the right-wing social-democratic splitters and against the Tito bandit gang, who are agents of the Anglo-American warmongers, can the unity of the working class be achieved."

"The first few days of the European Workers' Conference have demonstrated the determination of the European working class to unite and fight against the bloody plans of the Anglo-American imperialists and West German revanchists. The European Workers' Conference will make a great contribution to the cause of fighting against the remilitarization of West Germany, against the warmongers, and for lasting peace in Europe and the world. It will further unite the broad masses in the struggle for peace. European workers and all peace-loving forces will defend the peace and security of all countries with their joint actions."

### 真理报评论：各国工人统一行动和平运动必将获胜

　　真理报评论：各国工人统一行动和平运动必将获胜
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十五日发表社论，评论工人阶级在为和平而斗争中的统一行动。
    社论写道：和平运动越来越广泛地在开展着。这个运动的活力和它的无敌，是由于它团结着各种不同阶层的亿万人民。工人阶级是和平运动的领导力量。各国工人在和平斗争中所扩大和加强的国际团结与统一行动，是和平运动必将获胜的保证。目前正在柏林开会的欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化代表大会，就是劳动人民国际团结的表现。
    美、英、法的统治集团已公然走上重新武装西德的道路。西德的全部经济都已转上战争轨道。正如在欧洲工人代表大会上所指出的，在西德已经开始大规模生产作战物资。有十七个企业已在制造飞机的马达和装备品。有三十多家工厂已在制造坦克车的零件和装备品。有三十五个企业已在制造大炮的炮弹。还有许多其他德国企业已在制造军需品，在德国西部各占领区和柏林西区，正在警察部队的幌子下编组法西斯雇佣军队，其实力已约有五十万人。
    全世界人民坚决抗议西德的重新军国主义化。这个摧毁帝国主义者重新武装西德计划的真诚愿望，使欧洲十八个国家的工人代表聚集到柏林。欧洲无产阶级决心把保卫欧洲和平的事业掌握在他们自己的手里。
    无产阶级应在为和平而进行的斗争中团结一致的观念，在亿万工人们的心中日益生根。在整个国际工人运动的历史中，无论在个别的国家中或者在世界规模上，工人阶级的团结从来不曾具有像今天这样决定性的重要意义。
    帝国主义战争贩子们知道：如果各国工人阶级团结一致，如果工人阶级巩固着和领导着群众为和平而进行的斗争，那么，他们想发动另一次血腥的屠杀是永远不会成功的。为了这个缘故，美英帝国主义者们在他们的特务——右翼社会党分子和铁托法西斯匪帮——的协助下，使用他们所有的力量来分裂工人运动，来推翻国际无产阶级的势力。经验已经告诉我们：只有对右翼社会党分裂派、对作为美英战争贩子的特务的铁托匪帮进行坚决的斗争，才可以达到工人阶级的团结。
    欧洲工人代表大会的最初几天，证明欧洲工人阶级团结起来为反对美英帝国主义者和西德报复主义者的血腥计划而斗争的决心。欧洲工人代表大会对于为反对西德重新军国主义化、反对战争煽动者、以及为欧洲及全世界的持久和平而斗争的事业将有伟大的贡献。它将使为和平而斗争的广大群众愈益团结起来。欧洲工人们和一切爱好和平的力量将用他们共同的行动来保卫各国的和平与安全。
