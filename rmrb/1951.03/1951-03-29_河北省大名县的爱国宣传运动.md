Striving to Popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

　　The Patriotic Propaganda Campaign in Daming County, Hebei Province
    Shi Pu
    Around the Spring Festival this year, Daming County in Hebei Province launched a large-scale patriotic anti-American propaganda campaign, focusing on mobilizing the masses for mutual aid in production, holding family meetings to set production plans, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers, and collecting supplies for comfort and relief.
    Before the campaign, the Daming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted three special studies, made specific plans, and called on all Party members in the county to actively participate in and lead this historically significant political movement. Mass organizations also gave specific instructions. For example, the Communist Youth League stipulated that each member should conduct propaganda among three to five people during the Spring Festival and first do a good job of propaganda and education in their own families. Teachers and students organized a strong propaganda force and, during the movement, selected sixty teachers to form a work team to assist in carrying out the movement in various districts. Leading cadres personally made reports on current political affairs to cadres and the people. Many cadres, teachers, students, etc., actively carried out propaganda activities when visiting relatives and friends during the Spring Festival holiday. Rural cadres, Party members, and Youth League members played a leading role in the movement. These were the main driving forces for the widespread development of the movement.
    During the movement, a large number of folk artists were organized to participate, giving play to their artistic talents, so that the form of propaganda was varied and popular with the masses, and the scale of the movement spread to various market towns and vast rural areas. In the urban area alone, twenty-nine streets organized twenty-five entertainment teams or costumed propaganda teams, with the number of participants reaching 3,100 (including 1,100 women). They used old forms familiar to the masses and enriched them with new anti-American patriotic content. For example, Huangdi Third Village in the Second District changed "Carrying the Magistrate" into "Carrying Truman"; the "Lion Dance" in Muti Village in the Fourth District was changed to "Puncturing the American Imperialist Paper Tiger"; the "Flower Cart and Flower Boat" in Youfen Town in the Third District was changed to "Seeing Off the People's Volunteers to Cross the River to Fight." Other performances included "Defending World Peace" in Gecun in the Fifth District; "The Brutality of American Imperialism in Korea" in Jintan Town in the Sixth District; as well as Yangko dance, lotus drop, stick dance, cross-talk, magic lantern shows, street plays, social fire performances, stilt walking, clapper talk, and various other forms. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 370 villages in the county organized such cultural and entertainment propaganda activities, accounting for 65 percent of the total number of villages in the county. The participants ranged from young and middle-aged people to women; from white-haired old people leaning on crutches to children aged five or six; from the broad masses of peasants to urban merchants and religious circles, all were swept into this movement. Zhang, an old lady in her fifties from Xiguan Village, participated in the Yangko dance; Li Baoxi, eighty-three years old from Dongdajie, also actively participated in entertainment activities; almost all the young women on Xidajie were swept into this wave, and everyone learned seven or eight new songs; sixteen believers on Nanjie all participated in the Yangko propaganda team. Experience has proved that seizing the people's habitual festivals and using lively and popular folk forms to carry out widespread mass propaganda movements is a good way to popularize the anti-American patriotic movement.
    After the propaganda, many people who were not concerned about national affairs understood the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the reason for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting their homes, and defending the country. The views of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism and national self-esteem and self-confidence were further established among the broad masses.
    Another gain of this propaganda movement was that it directly promoted the production movement and various tasks. Throughout the county, the slogan "Learn from Zhang Xishun's method of mutual aid in production, increase grain and cotton production, as a practical action to resist America and aid Korea!" was put forward. The Ren Yongxiu mutual aid team in Lizhuang in the Sixth District, in order to resist America and aid Korea, brought forward the commencement plan for digging and hammering twenty wells; Hu Yubin from Muti Village in the Fourth District led representatives of five mutual aid teams to Niangniangmiao Village, thirty miles away, on the fifth day of the first lunar month to visit labor model Zhang Xishun and learn from his production experience; Wen Fuqing from the Fifth District wrote a challenge letter to Zhang Xishun; ninety-eight villages in the Sixth District challenged Zhang Xishun and launched a patriotic production competition; about 70 percent of the peasant masses in the county proposed to learn from Zhang Xishun.
    In order to carry out the patriotic production competition, most farmers held family meetings during the Spring Festival and formulated this year's production increase plans. Tong Qiao from Xiaohu Village in the Fourth District has already set out this year's production plan: opening ten mu of sandy land, planting fifty fruit trees in sandy wasteland, planting two hundred trees, tilling the land nine times, and applying three to five carts of manure per mu to achieve the plan of producing thirty bags of grain and thirty bags of peanuts. Liang Youchun and his wife from Shahe Road challenged each other at the family meeting: one worked hard to spin and weave, and the other worked hard to produce. The peasant masses in the flood-stricken areas proposed: "Strive to produce, not only not rely on national relief, but also do our best to support the volunteer army."
    The achievements of the movement are also reflected in the enthusiastic donations of the broad masses for resisting America and aiding Korea. When the masses understood the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and the difficult living conditions of the Korean people who suffered from the brutal destruction of American imperialism, a fundraising movement was launched like a storm. Songqu Village in the Third District raised 500,000 yuan in three days. Cheng Shian, who sold sweet potatoes in the village, donated all 23,000 yuan he earned in one day. He said, "Let's use the money I earn in one day to resist America and aid Korea, just as if I had contributed a day of labor to the Korean people, and also show our friendship." Gecun raised more than 400 kilograms of coarse grains in one day, and the women made 200 comfort bags. According to preliminary statistics from 51 villages in the Fifth District alone, 6,207 kilograms of grain, 781,600 yuan in RMB, and 612 comfort bags have been raised.
    The spring plowing and sowing season is approaching. In order to consolidate and continue to popularize the anti-American patriotic movement, the Daming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has timely deployed the work for the next stage.

　　河北省大名县的爱国宣传运动
    石璞
    河北省大名县在今年春节前后，开展了规模宏大的抗美爱国宣传运动，而以发动群众互助生产、开家庭会议订生产计划、拥护军队与优待革命军人家属、募集慰劳救济品等为中心内容。
    运动前，中共大名县委员会进行了三次专门研究，作了具体计划，号召全县党员积极参加并领导这一具有历史意义的政治运动；各群众团体也都作了具体指示，如青年团规定每个团员在春节期间要向三个至五个群众进行宣传，并且首先要作好对自己家庭的宣传教育；教师和学生们，组织了强大的宣传队伍，并在运动中抽出六十名教师组成工作队，分赴各区协助开展这一运动；领导干部亲自动手，向干部和人民群众作时事政治报告；许多干部、教师、学生等，在春节假期访亲拜友中积极进行宣传活动；农村干部、党员、团员、在运动中起了带头作用。这些都是使运动广泛开展的主要动力。
    运动中组织了广大的民间艺人参加，发挥了他们的艺术天才，从而使宣传的形式做到多种多样，为群众所喜闻乐见；也使运动的规模普及到各个集镇和广大乡村。仅城区二十九个街道就组织了二十五个游艺班或化装宣传队，参加的人数达三千一百人（内有妇女一千一百人）。他们利用了群众熟习的旧形式而充实以抗美爱国的新内容。如二区黄堤三村将《抬杠官》改成了《抬杜鲁门》；四区木堤村的《狮子》，改为《戳破美帝国主义纸老虎》；三区油粉町的《花车花船》，改为《欢送人民志愿军渡江作战》。其他如五区葛村演出了《保卫世界和平》；六区金滩镇演出了《美帝国主义在朝鲜的残暴》；还有秧歌、莲花落、打花棍、相声、拉洋片、街头剧、社伙、高跷、快板等等各色各样的形式。据初步统计，全县组织这样文化娱乐宣传活动的村庄共达三百七十余个，占全县村庄总数的百分之六十五。参加的群众，由青壮年到妇女；由白发倚杖的老人到五、六岁的髫龄儿童，由广大的农民群众到城镇商人和宗教界，都卷入了这一运动。西关村五十多岁的张老太太参加了扭秧歌；东大街八十三岁的李保溪，也积极参加娱乐活动；西大街的青年妇女几乎全部卷入了这一浪潮，每个人都学到了七、八支新歌；南街十六名教徒都参加了秧歌宣传队。经验证明，抓住人民习惯的节日，利用生动活泼的民间形式来开展广泛群众性的宣传运动，是使抗美爱国运动达到普及的一个好办法。
    经过宣传，许多素不关心国家大事的人都了解了中朝人民的伟大胜利及抗美援朝保家卫国的道理，在广大群众中进一步树立了对美帝国主义的仇视、鄙视、蔑视的观点与民族自尊心、自信心。
    这次宣传运动的另一收获是直接推动了生产运动与各种工作。全县到处提出“学习张希顺的互助生产办法，增产粮棉，作为抗美爱国的实际行动！”六区李庄任永修互助组，为了抗美爱国，把打、锤水井二十眼的开工计划提前实施；四区木堤村胡玉彬带领五个互助组的代表，于正月初五赴三十里以外的娘娘庙村访问劳动模范张希顺，学习他的生产经验；五区文福庆向张希顺写了挑战书；六区有九十八个村庄向张希顺挑战，开展爱国生产竞赛；全县约有百分之七十的农民群众，都提出要向张希顺学习。
    为了开展爱国主义生产竞赛，绝大部分农民在春节期间都召开了家庭会，制订了今年的增产计划。四区小胡村同乔已订出了今年生产计划：开沙地十亩、沙荒栽果树五十棵、植树二百棵、地要耕九遍，每亩地要上粪三车至五车，以实现产粮三十口袋、花生三十口袋的计划。沙河路梁有春夫妇在家庭会上相互挑战：一个努力纺织，一个努力生产。水灾区农民群众提出：“努力生产，不但不靠国家救济，还要尽力支援志愿军。”
    运动的成绩还表现在广大群众为抗美援朝而踊跃捐输上。当群众认识了中朝人民的兄弟友谊关系及朝鲜人民遭受美帝国主义的残暴破坏而生活困难的情况，便风起云涌地掀起了募集运动。三区宋区村在三天当中就募了五十万元。该村卖红薯的程士安将一天所赚的二万三千元全部捐献出来，他说：“我一天赚的钱都抗美援朝吧，就当我给朝鲜人民出了一天劳力，也表表咱的朋友心肠。”葛村一天募集了四百余斤粗粮，妇女们做了二百个慰问袋。仅据五区五十一个村的初步统计，已募集了粮食六千二百零七斤，人民币七十八万一千六百元，慰问袋六百一十二个。
    春耕播种季节将至。为了巩固与继续普及开展抗美爱国运动，中共大名县委已及时布置了下一阶段的工作。
