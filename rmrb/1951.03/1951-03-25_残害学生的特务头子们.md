The special agent chiefs who persecuted students
Lu Niangao

During the time when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ruled Beijing, the patriotic students of Beijing held many large-scale demonstrations and parades to oppose hunger, persecution, American support for Japan, and to protest against the atrocities of the US military. However, their just actions were obstructed by special agents every time. Hundreds of students were beaten and arrested by these agents. Some were even secretly murdered by them. This blood debt has been owed for many years. Now, those special agent chiefs who specialized in persecuting students, such as Zhao Zhongrong (Deputy Minister of the Kuomintang Central Youth Department), Leng Shaoying (Commissioner of the Central Bureau of Statistics North China District Office), Zhang Minzhi (Deputy Director of the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters), Lü Ping (Executive Committee Member and Training Section Chief of the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters), Chen Zhonghe (Deputy Leader of the Military Bureau of Statistics Peiping Station Student Movement Group), Fu Zhongyi (Leader of the Central Bureau of Statistics Peiping District Group), and Pang Hao (Internal Affairs Section Chief of the Peiping Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department), have finally fallen into the people's net. The students of Beijing have the right to demand repayment of this blood debt from them.

Before liberation, special agent chiefs Zhao Zhongrong, Leng Shaoying, and Zhang Minzhi instigated Lü Ping, Chen Zhonghe, Fu Zhongyi, Pang Hao, and others to organize thousands of special agent thugs, repeatedly blockading schools and arresting students. They brutally beat student parade marchers in the Xidan and Xizhimen areas. They stormed into Hebei High School, North China College, Chaoyang College, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Normal University to commit violence. In 1948, a special agent student at Chaoyang College, Wang Zhen, under the direction of Zhang Minzhi, openly set up a torture chamber in the school, torturing classmates and terrorizing the entire school. On the night of April 8 of the same year, a large group of special agents, during martial law, fired shots and broke into Normal University, brutally beating students with nail-studded wooden sticks. They dragged eight blood-soaked students, wearing only undershirts and shorts, from the dormitory to trucks outside the school, spilling blood all over the road, creating the "April 9th Bloodshed Incident" that shocked the whole country. By the 11th, in order to counter the city-wide student anti-persecution demonstration and parade held on the 9th, Zhang Minzhi and others organized special agent thugs to hold a "counter-anti-persecution" violent parade. They beat anyone they saw wearing a Peking University badge, injuring six people in a row. They ran to Sand Beach, smashed most of the windows on the south side of Peking University's Red Building, slashed the wooden sign of "Peking University Faculty and Staff Dormitory," and destroyed Professor Wu Enyu's residence. They wanted to use fascist terror and violence to suppress the students' patriotic movement.

These atrocities were disguised at the time as "student infighting" or "voluntary actions by the masses." However, today, they have been forced to confess the truth. Lü Ping's confession stated that on June 2, 1947 (on that day, the Kuomintang bandit gang heard that Beijing students were about to launch a city-wide strike, market strike, class strike, and teaching strike, and were therefore greatly panicked, using special agent thugs and puppet military police to block all universities, forbidding entry and exit), "I commanded Bai Jin of the National Martial Arts Association and others to lead more than 700 thugs to surround Tsinghua and Yenching Universities. Each thug was given 20,000 yuan." Zhang Minzhi's confession stated that on the evening of April 8, 1948, he called special agent students from China University, Han Jingqi and others, to his home for a meeting, deciding to use special agent students from various schools to arrest people at Normal University, with the puppet police assisting outside. During the "counter-anti-persecution" parade on April 11, the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters prepared iron-rod flags and wooden sticks for the thugs, instructing them to brutally beat students. The parade headquarters, which was set up in the puppet Senate at the time, was jointly presided over by Zhang Minzhi, bandit Peiping Garrison Commander Chen Jicheng, and Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters Director Wu Zhuren, and others. On the eve of the large-scale arrest of students on August 19, 1948, bandit Youth Department Minister Chen Xueping took a blacklist to Beijing, and Zhao Zhongrong and Zhang Minzhi, along with Chen Xueping, Hu Shi, and others, established a command post and drafted a blacklist. Zhang Minzhi personally led informants to arrest people at various schools.

Starting in 1946, Central Bureau of Statistics special agent Leng Shaoying and Military Bureau of Statistics special agent Chen Zhonghe, among others, used special agent students from various schools to organize intelligence groups, communication groups, the China Youth Service Society, the Youth Advancement Association, etc., to collect intelligence, monitor classmates, and compile blacklists. Leng Shaoying once ordered the heads of various communication groups to: "Collect as much intelligence as possible, and arrest all progressive students at various universities in one fell swoop. Anyone who slanders the government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang) or attacks the school authorities will be charged as suspected communist elements." Students who fell into their hands were almost certain to face death. Pang Hao himself confessed: "I used torture on all suspected communist elements." Under these circumstances, Peking University students Meng Xianggong, Li Gongyi, Deng Te, Normal University professor Xu Yingchao, students Qiu Xien, Zhao Xueqin, etc., were all beaten until they were covered in wounds and their tendons and bones were broken. Some were even subjected to cruel tortures such as being forced to sit on the tiger bench, being hung up and beaten, having cold water poured down their throats, and having red-hot iron rods applied to their bodies. Professor Xu Yingchao recalled the situation after being tortured in his memoir, "Lying half-dead on a mat. Both legs were so swollen that they could not move. Both arms were so sore from being hung up that they could not move. The mouth was bleeding from being beaten. The eyes were dazed from being beaten. Looking at both hands, both hands had lost consciousness. The wrists were broken and bleeding. The whole hand was purple and swollen, looking unlike a human hand. Looking at the body, there were dozens of places on the whole body where the skin was burnt and the flesh was rotten." Qiu Xien's left little finger is still missing a section to this day. This is ironclad evidence of the special agents' persecution of patriotic teachers and students. How can this blood feud not be avenged!

The crimes of this group of special agents are not limited to persecuting students. When progressive figures in Beijing held a gathering at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall in April 1946, Leng Shaoying, Pang Hao, and others personally led special agent thugs, using eggs, stones, iron rods, and wooden sticks to injure Professor Chen Jinkun and many others, disrupting the meeting. They also used their power to embezzle and extort, stopping at nothing. Leng Shaoying even forced residents of the Ninth District to subscribe to his special agent magazine, "China Morning Bell." The subscription fees looted in this way amounted to ten taels of gold!

This group of special agents are all resolute counter-revolutionaries and anti-people. Take Leng Shaoying, for example. Not only did he owe the people countless blood debts before liberation, but also during the siege of Beijing, he organized shock troops to search for and arrest five or six revolutionary figures. He also used his position as a puppet senator to resolutely advocate war, sabotage peaceful liberation, and harm the people. Before fleeing, he also arranged for the underground work of Central Bureau of Statistics special agents; after fleeing to the Northwest, he also organized the so-called "Sichuan-Kang-Shaanxi-Gansu-Qinghai Armed Task Force," attempting to continue to slaughter the people. The people will not forgive such resolute counter-revolutionary elements. In their confessions, they themselves admitted that they were "guilty of numerous crimes that could not be enumerated" and that they had "lost their conscience and deserved to die!"

　　残害学生的特务头子们
    卢念高
    在蒋介石匪帮统治北京的时候，北京的爱国学生们，为了反饥饿、反迫害、反对美国扶植日本，抗议美军暴行，曾经轰轰烈烈地举行过许多次示威大游行。但是他们每一次的正义行动，都受到特务们的阻挠。成百的学生，受到特务们的毒打和逮捕。有的甚至被特务们秘密屠杀。这笔血债已经欠了好多年了。现在，那些专门残害学生的特务头子赵仲容（国民党中央青年部副部长）、冷少颖（中统华北区办事处专员）、张民治（国民党北平市党部副主任委员）、吕坪（国民党北平市党部执行委员、组训科长）、陈仲和（军统北平站学运组副组长）、傅仲义（中统北平区组长）、庞浩（匪北平警备司令部稽查处内勤股长）等，到底落入了人民的法网。北京学生们有权利向他们讨还这笔血债。
    在解放前，特务头子赵仲容、冷少颖、张民治，曾经主使吕坪、陈仲和、傅仲义、庞浩等，组织了成千的特务打手，屡次封锁学校，逮捕学生。在西单和西直门一带毒打学生的游行队伍。他们冲进河北高中、华北学院、朝阳学院、辅仁大学、师范大学去行过凶。一九四八年，朝阳学院的特务学生王镇，在张民治的指使下，公然在校内设立刑堂，拷打同学，恐怖笼罩着全校。同年的四月八日深夜，一大群特务，在戒严期间，鸣枪闯入师范大学，用带钉的木棒毒打学生。把八个鲜血淋漓，只穿着背心裤衩的学生，从宿舍拖到校外的大卡车上，血洒满路，造成了震动全国的“四九血案”。到十一日，为了对付全市学生在九日举行的反迫害示威大游行，张民治等又组织特务打手，举行“反反迫害”的行凶游行。他们看见挂北京大学徽章的人就打，一连打伤了六个。他们跑到沙滩，打坏了北京大学红楼南面的大部分窗户，刀劈“北大教职员宿舍”的木牌，捣毁吴恩裕教授的住宅。他们想用法西斯的恐怖暴行，来镇压学生的爱国运动。
    这些暴行，在当时是用“学生互殴”或“民众自愿行动”的伪装来作掩饰的。但是，在今天，他们不得不供出了真象。吕坪的口供里说，一九四七年六月二日（那天，国民党匪帮听说北京学生要发动全市性的罢工、罢市、罢课、罢教，因此大为恐惶，用特务打手和伪军警，封锁了所有的大学，不许出入），“我指挥国术社的白瑾等，率领七百多打手，包围清华、燕京两大学。每个打手发给两万元。”张民治的口供里说，一九四八年四月八日晚上，他找中国大学的特务学生韩景屺等到他家里开会，决定用各校的特务学生，到师范大学去逮人，由伪警察在外面协助。四月十一日“反反迫害”游行时，国民党市党部给打手们预备了铁杆小旗和木棒，叫他们毒打学生。当时在伪参议会内设立的游行指挥部，就是由张民治和匪北平警备司令陈继承、国民党北平市党部主任委员吴铸人等共同主持。在一九四八年八月十九日大捕学生的前夕，匪青年部部长陈雪屏拿了黑名单到北京，赵仲容、张民治就和陈雪屏、胡适等一起成立了指挥部，拟定黑名单。张民治亲率眼线，到各校捕人。
    从一九四六年起，中统特务冷少颖和军统特务陈仲和等，利用各校特务学生，组织情报小组、通讯小组、中华青年服务社、青年前进会等，搜集情报，监视同学，开列黑名单。冷少颖曾经命令各通讯小组长说：“尽量搜集情报，将各大学进步学生，一网打尽。凡是诋毁政府（指蒋介石匪帮）、攻击学校当局的，一律按共产党嫌疑分子论罪。”学生们落入他们的手中，差不多都是九死一生。庞浩自己供认：“我对于所有的共产党嫌疑分子，一律施用毒刑。”在这种情况下，北京大学学生孟宪功、李恭贻、邓特、师范大学教授徐英超，学生邱锡恩、赵学勤等，都被打得遍体鳞伤，筋折骨断。有的更受遍了坐老虎凳，吊打，灌凉水，烙通条等等非刑。徐英超教授在蒙难记里回忆受刑后的情况说：“半死地躺在一块席上。两腿肿得不能动。两臂被吊疼得不能动。嘴被打得出血。眼被打得昏迷。看两手，两手已失去知觉。手腕已皮破血出。满手青紫，肿得不像人手样。看身子，全身被烫得皮焦肉烂的有几十处。”邱锡恩到现在左手小指还短了一截。这是特务们残害爱国师生的铁证。这血海深仇，怎能不报！
    这群特务的罪行，还不止是残害学生这一项。当一九四六年四月，北京市的进步人士在中山公园音乐堂举行集会时，冷少颖、庞浩等亲率特务打手，用鸡蛋、石块、铁棍、木棒，打伤陈瑾昆教授等许多人，搅散了会场。他们还利用权势，贪污敲诈，无所不为。冷少颖就曾强迫九区市民，订阅他办的特务杂志《中国晨钟》。这样掠夺来的订费就有黄金十两！
    这群特务都是坚决反革命、反人民的。拿冷少颖来说，他不止解放前欠人民无数的血债，就是在北京围城时期，他还组织突击队，搜捕革命人士五六人。他又利用伪参议员的身份，坚决主战，破坏和平解放，祸害人民。他在临逃之前，还布置下中统特务的潜伏工作；在逃到西北以后，还组织所谓“川康陕甘青武装工作队”，企图继续屠杀人民。人民对这样的坚决反革命分子，是不会宽恕的。他们在供词里自己也承认是“罪行累累，擢发难数”“良心泯灭，死有余辜”！
