　　European Workers' Great Action to Defend Peace
    The European Workers' Congress Against the Remilitarization of Germany successfully concluded in Berlin on the 25th of this month. The congress discussed the report "Joint Action of the Laboring People and Trade Unions of European Countries to Fight Against the Remilitarization of Germany" and made a resolution. At the same time, the congress also elected the European Workers' Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany, including representatives from European countries. This great unity of the European working class in the movement to defend peace is a serious blow to the war policies pursued by the American, British, and French imperialists in Europe.
    Due to the United States' insistence on its war policy, intensifying the arming of West Germany in Europe, and intensifying the arming of Japan in Asia, a new crisis of world war has been created. The peaceful lives of people in all countries are suffering serious threats. Especially the lives of people in capitalist countries and colonial countries are increasingly falling into greater poverty and oppression due to the intensified arms race by the American, British, and French imperialist blocs. The laboring people of all countries are the first to bear the brunt, suffering the most cruel exploitation, and therefore are the first to come into conflict with the imperialists' war preparations policy, thus rising up to oppose war.
    The people of European countries have widely launched a movement to defend peace and oppose the American arming of West Germany. The working class is the leading force in this great movement. Amidst the widespread opposition and angry protests of the European people, war peddler Eisenhower completed his West European tour to organize a unified European aggressive army while hiding behind police sentry posts. In France and Belgium, national referendums against the rearmament of West Germany have been launched, and France has collected 3.5 million signatures. People from all walks of life in West Germany have decided to form a "Central Committee Against Remilitarization" for unified action, and will take measures to hold a people's referendum on the issue of remilitarization nationwide. The great momentum of the Italian people's protest movement against the rearmament of West Germany has made the war peddlers shudder. Recently, at the first session of the World Peace Council held in Berlin, it was further resolved that the associations against the remilitarization of Germany in France and Belgium should convene a meeting of the people of the European signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Paris or Brussels as soon as possible, and invite the German people to participate. The purpose of the meeting is to study the struggle against the remilitarization of Germany and the peaceful resolution of the German question. This time, the European Workers' Representatives Conference has further pushed the European people's movement to defend peace to a new stage of unified action. The close unity and concerted action among the people of all countries in the movement to defend peace is the guarantee of the inevitable victory of the peace movement.
    The great success of the European Workers' Representatives Conference fully demonstrates the determination of the European working class to defend peace, as well as the broad and powerful strength of the European forces defending peace centered on the working class. Under the influence of the unified action of European workers, the movement of the people of European countries to defend peace and oppose the rearmament of Germany will surely develop more widely and deeply, and will generate tremendous power for preventing war and smashing the struggle of American imperialism to rearm Germany.

　　欧洲工人保卫和平的伟大行动
    欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化代表大会，已于本月二十五日在柏林胜利闭幕。大会讨论了“欧洲各国劳动人民和工会一致行动，为反对德国重新军国主义化而斗争”的报告，并作出决议。同时，大会还选出了包括欧洲各国代表在内的欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会。欧洲工人阶级在保卫和平运动中的这一伟大团结，是对美、英、法帝国主义在欧洲推行战争政策的严重打击。
    由于美国坚持其战争政策，在欧洲加紧武装西德，在亚洲加紧武装日本，造成了目前新的世界战争的危机。各国人民的和平生活遭受着严重的威胁，尤其是各资本主义国家和各殖民地国家人民的生活，由于美、英、法帝国主义集团加紧备战的结果，日益陷于更加贫困与被压迫的状态。各国劳动人民，更是首当其冲，遭受着最残酷的压榨，也就最先与帝国主义的备战政策发生矛盾，因而奋起反对战争。
    欧洲各国人民已广泛地展开了保卫和平、反对美国武装西德的运动。工人阶级是这一伟大运动的领导力量。在欧洲人民普遍反对与愤怒抗议的怒潮中，战争贩子艾森豪威尔躲在警察岗哨的后面才完成了他组织欧洲统一侵略军的西欧巡行。在法国和比利时，都已展开了反对重新武装西德的全国投票，法国并已经征集了三百五十万个签名票。西德各界人民为统一行动，决定筹组“反对重新军国主义化中央委员会”，将采取措施在全国就重新军国主义化问题举行人民投票。意大利人民抗议重新武装西德运动的浩大声势，使战争贩子们感到战栗。最近，在柏林举行的世界和平理事会第一届会议上，更决议在最短时间内由法国和比利时反对德国重新军国主义化协会在巴黎或布鲁塞尔召开北大西洋公约欧洲各签约国的人民的会议，并邀请德国人民参加。会议的目的是研究关于反对德国重新军国主义化的斗争以及和平方式解决德国问题。这次，欧洲工人代表会议是进一步地将欧洲各国人民保卫和平运动推上了统一行动的新阶段。各国人民之间在保卫和平运动中的紧密团结与一致行动，就是和平运动必然获胜的保证。
    欧洲工人代表会议的伟大成功，充分显示了欧洲工人阶级保卫和平的决心，以及以工人阶级为中心的欧洲保卫和平力量的广阔强大。在欧洲工人统一行动的影响下，欧洲各国人民保卫和平、反对重新武装德国的运动必将得到更广泛与深入的发展，对于阻止战争，粉碎美国帝国主义重新武装德国的斗争，将发生巨大的力量。
