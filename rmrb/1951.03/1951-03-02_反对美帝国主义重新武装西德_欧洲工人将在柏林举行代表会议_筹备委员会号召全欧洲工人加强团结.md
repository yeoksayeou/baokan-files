Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: European workers are preparing to convene a European Workers' Delegate Conference in order to further unfold the struggle against the American imperialist plot to re-arm West Germany. The suggestion to convene this conference was first proposed by the workers of the "Gaspe羽特" Metallurgical Factory. It quickly received a response from many enterprises in West Germany. Subsequently, worker representatives from France and Germany held a joint meeting based on this suggestion and elected a preparatory committee. The preparatory committee recently issued an open letter to all European workers, suggesting that the European Workers' Delegate Conference be held in Berlin from March 23rd to 25th, 1951, to discuss "The question of unified action by the working people and trade unions of European countries against the re-militarization of Germany."

The preparatory committee called on all workers to strengthen this action. The letter to the workers specifically pointed out: "Now, it is not enough to merely protest against the re-militarization of Germany. The current task is to actively unite and promote the spirit of international solidarity, which is a characteristic of the working class, to oppose the re-militarization of Germany. Close cooperation between the working class and all peace-loving men and women will certainly help to prevent war and rearmament, and eliminate all its consequences."

　　反对美帝国主义重新武装西德
    欧洲工人将在柏林举行代表会议
    筹备委员会号召全欧洲工人加强团结
    【新华社一日讯】欧洲各国工人正筹备召开欧洲工人代表大会，以便进一步展开反对美国帝国主义重新武装西德阴谋的斗争。召开这个大会的建议是“加斯贝羽特”冶金工厂工人首先提出的。它迅速得到西德许多企业的响应。其后，法、德两国工人代表即根据此项建议，举行了联席会议，并选出了筹备委员会。该筹备委员会已于日前发出告全欧工人书，建议在一九五一年三月二十三日至二十五日，在柏林举行欧洲工人代表大会，讨论《欧洲各国劳动人民及各工会反对德国重新军国主义化的统一行动的问题”。
    筹委会号召所有工人加强这一行动。告工人书特别指出：“现在，仅仅抗议德国重新军国主义化是不够的，目前的任务，是要积极团结起来，发扬工人阶级的特色——国际团结的精神，来反对德国重新军国主义化。工人阶级与一切爱好和平的男女密切合作，一定会有助于阻止战争和重整军备，并消除其一切后果。”
