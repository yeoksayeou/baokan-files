Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Currently, varying degrees of livestock epidemics are prevalent throughout the country, with approximately 10,000 head of draft animals having died, severely impacting spring plowing in various regions. To address this, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has telegraphed all regions to take emergency measures to swiftly eliminate the livestock epidemics and ensure timely spring plowing.

The livestock epidemics currently prevalent in various regions include rinderpest, hemorrhagic septicemia, anthrax, blackleg, and foot-and-mouth disease. These are prevalent in fourteen provinces and regions, including North China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and Central South China. Rinderpest is rampant in the North China and Central South China areas. In addition to instructing various regions on methods for preventing and controlling rinderpest, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has allocated 1 million CC of rinderpest serum and some medical equipment to Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces. At the same time, 19 veterinary personnel have been dispatched to the epidemic areas in the two provinces to assist in emergency treatment. The People's Governments of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces have also organized more than 200 veterinary personnel to go to the epidemic areas for treatment. According to recent statistics from Shanxi Province, more than 28,000 head of draft cattle have been inoculated, stabilizing the epidemic situation for the time being.

Foot-and-mouth disease (ulceration of the mouth and hooves of cattle) is a highly contagious epidemic, mainly spreading in the northwestern provinces. In addition to instructing the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Animal Husbandry Department to strictly implement isolation of epidemic areas and disinfection treatment, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has also transferred 32 veterinary personnel from other provinces and regions to rush to the area to assist in treatment.

In addition, the People's Governments of Henan, Northern Sichuan, and other regions are also vigorously mobilizing the masses to adopt methods such as sealing off and isolating epidemic areas and disinfection treatment to curb the spread of livestock epidemics.

[Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces, and thirty-two counties, have recently successively experienced severe outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, which seriously endangers draft cattle. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has invited Soviet experts and more than 30 senior veterinary cadres from Northeast China, North China, East China, Central South China, Inner Mongolia, and other regions to assist in prevention and control. The Northwest Military and Political Committee has also formed the Northwest Foot-and-Mouth Disease Prevention and Control Committee, and has assembled more than 50 veterinary experts to form five prevention and control teams, which are rushing to the epidemic areas for prevention and control. Provinces and counties where foot-and-mouth disease of draft cattle has occurred have formed branch committees and sub-committees to uniformly direct the local foot-and-mouth disease prevention and control work. In addition, the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued urgent instructions on the 11th, ordering local People's Governments and Party organizations to vigorously publicize the harm of foot-and-mouth disease and its prevention and control methods, and to widely mobilize the masses to carry out a movement to eliminate foot-and-mouth disease.

Note: Foot-and-mouth disease is one of the most easily transmitted malignant epidemics among cloven-hoofed animals. After livestock contract this disease, their mouths and hooves rot, they do not eat, and they cannot stand. They often develop bedsores, pneumonia, septicemia, mastitis, and other conditions due to weakened resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 16th: In order to protect draft animals and prevent the spread of livestock epidemics, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee plans to prevent and treat 4.46 million head of draft animals this year. Since the beginning of spring, draft animal prevention and treatment work has begun in various provinces. Guangxi and Henan provinces held provincial livestock and veterinary medicine conferences this spring, respectively, and formulated specific plans for preventing and controlling livestock epidemics. Special districts and counties such as Deng County, Fangcheng, and Nanzhao in Henan Province have also established livestock epidemic prevention and control stations. Since January, the Jiangxi Provincial Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Team has vaccinated more than 45,000 head of draft cattle in Shangrao, Jiujiang, Yiyang, and other places in the province. In order to provide the province's livestock epidemic prevention and control stations with sufficient serum and medicines, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has allocated 1.51 billion yuan as funding for manufacturing and purchasing medicines. Cow plague has occurred in Jiangling, Yangxin, Echeng and other counties in Hubei Province since the beginning of spring. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has sent epidemic prevention personnel to the affected areas for treatment.

　　畜疫流行严重影响进行春耕
    各地正大力抢治或隔离预防
    【新华社十六日讯】全国目前正流行着轻重不同的畜疫，已死亡耕畜约一万头，严重地影响着各地春耕的进行。为此，中央人民政府农业部已电令各地采取紧急措施，迅速扑灭畜疫，以保证及时春耕。
    此次各地流行的畜疫，计有牛瘟、出血性败血症、牛炭疽、气肿疽和口蹄疫；流行的区域遍及华北、西北、西南、中南等十四个省区。华北、中南一带牛瘟猖獗。中央人民政府农业部除指示各地防治牛瘟的办法外，并拨发给山西、绥远两省牛瘟血清一百万ＣＣ，和一部医疗器械。同时，并调派兽医人员十九名前往两省疫区协助抢治。山西、绥远两省人民政府也组织了兽医人员二百余名，分赴疫区治疗。据山西省最近统计，已注射耕牛二万八千余头，使疫势暂告稳定。
    口蹄疫（牛口蹄溃烂），系一种传染性极强的疫病，主要蔓延于西北各省。中央人民政府农业部除电令西北军政委员会畜牧部严格实行隔离疫区和消毒治疗外，并从其他各省区抽调兽医人员三十二名，急赴该区协助医治。
    此外，河南、川北等地人民政府也正大力发动群众采用封锁隔离疫区和消毒治疗等办法，遏止畜疫蔓延。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：青海、陕西、宁夏三省三十二县，最近先后发生严重危害耕牛的口蹄疫。中央人民政府农业部已邀请了苏联专家及东北、华北、华东、中南、内蒙等地高级兽医干部三十余人前往协助防治。西北军政委员会亦已组成西北口蹄疫防治委员会，调集五十多名兽医专家组成五个防治队，急赴疫区防治。各省及发生耕牛口蹄疫的县份，都组成分会和支会，统一指挥当地口蹄疫的防治工作。此外，西北军政委员会和中共中央西北局并于十一日分别发出紧急指示，责令各地人民政府和党的组织大力宣传口蹄疫的危害性及其防治办法，广泛发动群众，开展扑灭口蹄疫的运动。
    按：口蹄疫是偶蹄类牲畜中一种最易传染的恶疫。牲畜得此病后，口、蹄腐烂，不吃东西，也不能站立，常常由于抵抗力减弱，而引起褥疮、肺炎、败血病、乳房炎等症。
    【新华社汉口十六日电】为保护耕畜，预防畜疫流行，中南区军政委员会农林部计划今年防治耕畜四百四十六万头。入春以来，耕畜防治工作已在各省开始。广西、河南两省今春曾分别召开了全省畜牧兽医会议，拟定了防治畜疫工作的具体计划。河南省各专区及邓县、方城、南召等县，并已设立了畜疫防治站。江西省兽疫防治队自一月开始迄今，已在该省上饶、九江、弋阳等地，给四万五千余头耕牛打了防疫针。广东省人民政府为供应该省畜疫防治站以充分的血清和药品，特拨款十五亿一千万元，作为制造和购买药物的经费。湖北省江陵、阳新、鄂城等县，入春后曾先后发生牛瘟，该省人民政府农林厅已派出防疫人员分赴疫区救治。
