    To the Editorial Department:
    On February 1st, your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column published a letter regarding the practice of some private copper smelting factories in Shanghai adding phosphorus to copper wire, seriously harming state property, and requesting that we conduct a thorough investigation. Our handling of this matter is explained below: We began to discover this serious destructive behavior by unscrupulous manufacturers at the end of last year and suggested that various industrial and commercial administrative agencies, together with us, conduct inspections of wire quality to eliminate the sale of substandard copper wire. Recently, to further promote this work, we invited the East China Financial and Economic Committee Planning Bureau, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the China Industrial Materials Company East China Branch, the Shanghai Hardware Machinery Branch, and the Hardware Trade Union and other relevant agencies in February to discuss a comprehensive ban on substandard copper wire and to help factories adopt standard manufacturing methods. To safeguard the interests of legitimate manufacturers, it was decided to use conductivity as the inspection standard. When manufacturers' products leave the factory, they must clearly indicate the purpose, conductivity, grade, and operating voltage on the label. Those found to be selling products that do not meet specifications or are posing as qualified products will be severely punished after investigation. Afterwards, we also drafted the "Provisional Measures for Inspecting Wire Quality and Eliminating Inferior Products in East China," which was submitted to the East China Military and Political Committee for review in early March and will be implemented upon approval.

    华东区军政委员会工业部将严格检验电线品质取缔劣等产品编辑同志：
    二月一日贵报《读者来信》栏刊载上海某些私营炼铜厂铜线搀磷，严重的危害国家资财，希望我们彻查一事。现将我们对此事的处理说明如下：我们在去年年底，已开始发现不法厂商这种严重的破坏性行为，曾建议各工商行政机关会同我们进行电线品质的检验，以取缔劣质铜线的出售。最近为进一步推动此项工作，我们于二月间邀请华东财政经济委员会计划局、上海市工商局、中国工业器材公司华东区公司、上海五金机器分公司及五金工会等有关机关，会商全面取缔劣质铜线，帮助各厂采用正规制造方法。为维护正当厂商的利益，并决定以导电率为检验标准。各厂商产品出厂时，必须将用途、导电率、等级、使用电压等用标签标明，如检验不合规格或冒充合格货品出售者，查明后严予惩处。此后并拟订《华东区检验电线品质及取缔劣质产品暂行办法》，已于三月初呈请华东军政委员会核审，一俟批准，即可公布实施。
