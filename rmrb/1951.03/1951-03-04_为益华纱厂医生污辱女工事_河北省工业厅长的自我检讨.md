    A Self-Criticism from the Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry Regarding the Yihua Yarn Factory Doctor's Abuse of Female Workers
    Guo Yueyu, a doctor at the state-owned Yihua Yarn Factory in the Fengfeng Mining Area of Hebei, raped female worker Lian Jiping and illegally performed an abortion through surgery. The factory director, Hao Cheng, then dismissed the victimized worker, Lian Jiping, from the factory and detained her father for two days. I only became aware of this serious incident after it was revealed in the newspaper. This primarily demonstrates my lack of thoroughness in my usual work and represents extremely serious bureaucracy. In a New Democratic enterprise under the leadership of the People's Government, an incident of abusing female workers actually occurred. We, the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry, should bear the primary responsibility for this and should first conduct a serious self-criticism. I am a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party, and within a factory under my leadership, such an intolerable incident of persecuting workers occurred and was not discovered in a timely manner for such a long period. I believe this is a major error. This error is due to my lack of profound experience of the practical suffering of the working class in my usual work and insufficient concern for them. It is because non-proletarian consciousness has unconsciously dominated my thinking and is a manifestation of impure Party spirit, which should be subject to Party disciplinary action and administrative punishment.
    I examine my work with extreme remorse. Why did such an extremely serious error occur after the Central Government's repeated instructions to rely on the working class and after the collective study of the "February 7th" editorial by the managers and factory directors of all state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the province last year? This shows that I only rely on the working class verbally, but I have not actually put forward concrete measures to realize this slogan. I only studied the Trade Union Law formally, but I didn't actually understand it.
    Due to the imperfection of our leading organs, perhaps other state-owned factories within the scope of our province also have the same or more or less incorrect attitudes and views towards workers as the Yihua Yarn Factory. I am determined, in the spirit of being responsible to the people and being responsible for production, to seriously handle the case of the Yihua Yarn Factory doctor, Guo Yueyu, and the factory director persecuting workers, and use this matter to conduct a collective education among the leading cadres of all factories and mines in the province through meetings and learning.
    After the Yihua Yarn Factory incident was revealed, we have taken the following measures: (1) Dispatch Comrade Liu Dong, Director of the Light Industry Department of this Department, to go to the factory for in-depth inspection together with representatives from the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. (2) Order the factory to pay Comrade Lian Jiping, the female worker, the wages for the period from her dismissal to the present; restore her factory status. The factory will first provide care for her specific difficulties during her recuperation period. (3) Consult with the Hebei Provincial People's Court and order the local judicial organs to retry the doctor Guo Yueyu who persecuted the female worker. (4) Report this situation to the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government.
                                       Liu Zehua, Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry

    为益华纱厂医生污辱女工事  河北省工业厅长的自我检讨
    河北峰峰矿区省营益华纱厂医生郭月宇强奸女工连吉平，非法用手术堕胎。厂长郝诚又将被害工人连吉平开除厂籍，并扣押其父两日。这样的严重事件等到报上揭露后，我才发觉。这首先是我平时工作不深入，表现了极端严重的官僚主义。在人民政府领导下的新民主主义企业中，竟然会发生污辱女工的事件。这，我们河北省工业厅应该首先负责，应该首先严肃地进行检讨。我是一个中国共产党正式党员，在我领导下的工厂内，发生了这种使人难于容忍的迫害工人的事件，经过这样长久的岁月而未及时发觉。我认为这是一个极大的错误。这种错误是由于我平时在工作中对工人阶级切身痛苦体验得不深刻，关心得不够，是被非无产阶级意识支配了自己的思想而不自觉，是党性不纯的表现，应该受到党的纪律制裁和行政上的处分。
    我以极沉痛的心情来检查自己的工作。为什么在中央反复指示依靠工人阶级、在去年曾集中了全省省营工矿的经理和厂长集体学习“二七”社论之后，还产生这样极端严重的错误。可见我只是口头上依靠工人阶级，而实际并未拿出具体办法来实现这一口号。对于工会法只是形式上进行学习，实际上是没有懂。
    由于我们领导机关的不健全，在我省范围内的其他省营工厂，也许同样或多或少地存在着像益华纱厂这种极不正确的对待工人的态度和观点。我决以对人民负责、对生产负责的精神，严肃地处理益华纱厂医生郭月宇和厂长迫害工人的案件，并以此事在全省各厂矿的领导干部中，用开会和学习的方法，普遍地进行一次集体教育。
    当益华纱厂事件揭发之后，我们已进行以下措施：（１）派本厅轻工业处处长刘栋同志协同省民主妇女联合会、省工会派出的代表赴该厂深入检查。（２）令该厂补发女工连吉平同志自被开除后至今这一时期的工资；恢复她的厂籍。对她在休养时期的具体困难，由厂内先行给以照顾。（３）商同河北省人民法院，令当地司法机关重新审判迫害女工的医生郭月宇。（４）把这一情况报告中央人民政府纺织工业部。
