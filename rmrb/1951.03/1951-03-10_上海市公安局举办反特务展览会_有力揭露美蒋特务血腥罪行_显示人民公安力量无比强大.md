Xinhua News Agency Report: The anti-espionage exhibition held by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau powerfully exposes the bloody crimes of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's spies, and demonstrates the boundless power of the people's public security forces. Last month, 300,000 people visited the exhibition.

The exhibition is divided into ten parts. The first thing that appears before the audience is a photograph of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies cooperating to massacre the Chinese people. These photos were seized from the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary派 when Shanghai was liberated. From these photos, people can see how American spies used special cameras to secretly photograph the situation of our national defense construction and economic construction, and how American spies taught Kuomintang spies the killing skills to suppress the people. These photos vividly depict the true face of American bandits who call themselves "friends of China." The people of Shanghai still remember the Wang Xiaohe Martyr case, the Huang Jingwu Martyr case (son of Vice Premier Huang Yanpei), the "Shen Jiu Massacre" (workers of the Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9 were massacred by Kuomintang spies in February 1948 for demanding wage increases), and the revolutionary martyrs bodies活 buried by American and Chiang Kai-shek spies in Song Jiaoren Park. These are all blood debts jointly owed by American spies and Kuomintang spies trained by them.

After the liberation of Shanghai, American and Chiang Kai-shek spies continued to persecute the people in a covert way. The Luo Bingqian spy case cracked by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau is one example. Luo Bingqian was the "Shanghai Independent Station Chief of the Fourth Division of the Kuomintang Bureau of Investigation and Statistics". In August 1949, he was ordered by the US and Chiang Kai-shek to smuggle into Shanghai from Taiwan with a US-made radio station, hiding in a low wooden house of "Zhenji Porcelain Shop" on Guangfu Road in Zhabei. He used a US-made transmitter to indicate bombing targets for American and Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, causing the people of Shanghai to suffer heavy damage in the large-scale bombing by American and Chiang Kai-shek aircraft on February 6, 1950. Spy elements sneaked into factories in an attempt to sabotage the economic construction of New China. The spy Zhou Tongfu, who was hiding in the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, once destroyed ten tons of steel; the spy Chen Zhongfa, who sneaked into the Xinyu Textile Factory, printed and distributed reactionary slogans, and opened the tap at night to flood the workshop.

A portion of the American and Chiang Kai-shek spy documents displayed in the exhibition depicts the despicable, shameless, treacherous, and ruthless nature of the reactionaries. On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, American and Chiang Kai-shek spies arrested 356 students from 14 schools, including Fudan University and Jiaotong University. At that time, a Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau spy stated in a report to the bandit Chen Daqing, the Shanghai garrison commander: "This time, the arrest of 'communist suspect' students was made without any prior record of criminal suspicion or information available for interrogation," "Only based on personal feelings, most of them were signed with death, shooting, live burial, beheading and other signatures." The "Work Instructions for Military Intelligence Bureau Field Psychological Warfare Special Personnel" stated: "The fabrication of rumors must be in line with the facts and not easily detected by the masses." This is a confession of the Chiang Kai-shek spy agency's massacre and persecution of countless good people.

Although American and Chiang Kai-shek spy elements are cunning and deceitful, they will never escape the giant hands of the people. Since the liberation of Shanghai, with the assistance of the broad masses of the people, the Municipal People's Government has powerfully cracked various spy cases. Many chief spy elements, including Luo Bingqian who supplied bombing targets for American and Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, Liu Quand, a famous thug of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and Feng Qizeng, the heartless henchman of the spy boss Dai Li and a murderous demon, have all been captured and severely punished. Factories and enterprises have organized workers' pickets and reported spies who sabotaged production. The cunning spy Zhou Tongfu was captured after being reported.

　　上海市公安局举办反特务展览会
    有力揭露美蒋特务血腥罪行  显示人民公安力量无比强大
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市人民政府公安局举办的反特务展览会，有力地揭露了美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮特务的血腥罪行，并显示了人民公安力量的无比强大。展览会在上月有三十万人前往参观。
    展览会共分十部分。首先呈露在观众眼前的，是美蒋特务合作屠杀中国人民的照片。这些照片是在上海解放时自蒋匪反动派手中缴获的。从这些照片中人们看到：美国特务怎样利用特种照相机偷摄我国国防建设和经济建设的情形，美国特务怎样向国民党特务传授镇压人民的杀人伎俩。这些照片淋漓尽致地画出了自称“中国友人”的美国强盗的真面目。上海人民记忆犹新，王孝和烈士惨案、黄竞武烈士（黄炎培副总理之子）惨案、“申九惨案”（一九四八年二月申新纺织厂第九厂工人因要求增加工资而遭国民党特务屠杀），以及宋教仁公园被美蒋特务活埋的革命烈士尸体，这些都是美国特务及其训练的国民党特务共同欠下的血债。
    上海解放以后，美蒋特务以隐蔽的方式继续迫害人民。上海市人民政府公安局所破获的罗炳乾特务案，是其中的一个例子。罗炳乾是“国民党保密局第四处上海独立台长”，一九四九年八月受美蒋之命，从台湾带着美制电台潜来上海，隐伏在闸北光复路“振记磁号”一间低矮的木房里，用一架美制发报机为美蒋飞机指示轰炸目标，使上海人民在一九五零年二月六日美蒋飞机的大轰炸中遭受惨重的损害。特务分子钻进工厂，企图破坏新中国的经济建设。隐蔽在上海钢铁公司中的特务周同福，曾经破坏了十吨钢材；潜入新裕纺织厂的特务陈忠发，印发反动标语，并于夜间开放水龙头水淹车间。
    展览会中陈列的一部分美蒋特务文件，刻画出了反动分子的卑鄙无耻和奸险狠毒。上海解放前夕，美蒋特务逮捕了复旦大学、交通大学等十四个学校的三百五十六个学生。当时国民党军统特务写给匪上海警备司令陈大庆的签呈中供称：“此次逮捕‘匪嫌’学生，事前并无丝毫罪嫌纪录与可供讯之资料”，“仅凭借个人意气，大部均签注处死、枪决、活埋、杀头等签字”。匪“军统外勤心战专勤人员工作须知”中称：“谣言之制造须揣度与事实吻合，不易被群众识破”。这是蒋匪特务机关屠杀和迫害无数善良人民的自供。
    美蒋特务分子虽狡黠多端，但决逃不出人民的巨掌。上海解放以来，市人民政府在广大人民协助下，有力地破获了各种特务案件，许多首恶特务分子，包括供给美蒋飞机轰炸目标的罗炳乾、军统特务著名打手刘全德、特务头子戴笠的心腹爪牙杀人魔王封企曾等，都被捕获，并受到了严厉的制裁。各工厂企业组织了工人纠察队，并检举了破坏生产的特务。狡猾的特务周同福，就是被检举捕获的。
