Response to Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

To the Editor:

After reading Comrade Ren Jie's suggestions and criticisms in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on February 21 regarding the "Disorder at Tangshan Bus Station," we not only humbly accept them but also held meetings during employee study time for self-criticism. We now submit our self-criticism and future improvement measures and request that you publish them.

(1) Regarding the issue that the ticket windows do not indicate which route's tickets are being sold: We previously wrote the information on paper and posted it on the wall, but it was lost over time, and we did not promptly re-label it, causing passengers to run around asking questions. In the future, we plan to use enamel paint to clearly indicate the route and station names of the tickets sold at each ticket window on the glass, to prevent passengers from running around and affecting the order of the waiting room.

(2) Most of the ticket sellers at our station are newly appointed and unfamiliar with the business. Our leadership failed to provide responsible assistance and education, resulting in insufficient preparation by the ticket sellers before selling tickets, slow service, and frequent instances of poor attitudes towards passengers. We sincerely accept this criticism and will improve it in future work.

(3) Regarding the lack of signs on the buses, which affects passengers boarding: This is mainly because the number of passengers increased sharply around the Spring Festival, and vehicles were added to all routes, but there were not enough signs for the vehicles. The root cause is that we did not prepare or plan in advance, leaving passengers at a loss and causing disorder. We believe this is a very serious shortcoming, and in the future, we will assign dedicated personnel to maintain order and guide passengers.

(4) Regarding parking outside the station and selling tickets on the bus, this is mainly because the station's system is not strict, and sometimes there are too many vehicles and the courtyard is small. However, the leadership has not proactively studied improvements, and the ticket inspectors have not taken responsibility, allowing speculators to take advantage of loopholes. We believe that Comrade Ren Jie's suggestions are very valuable and should be given serious attention.

(5) The phenomenon of overcrowding on buses is because we one-sidedly focused on satisfying passengers' travel needs without considering their safety. This shows our lack of concern for people's lives. In the future, we will definitely implement a quota system to ensure passengers' safety and comfort.

Comrade Ren Jie's correct criticism of our station has pointed out the direction for improving our work, enabling us to further improve the people's transportation undertaking. In addition to expressing our gratitude to him, we hope that the general public will provide more suggestions to our station.

### 唐山汽车总站将建立制度改进工作

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    唐山汽车总站将建立制度改进工作编辑同志：
    读了贵报二月二十一日《读者来信》栏任杰同志对《唐山汽车总站秩序乱》的建议和批评，我们除虚心接受外，并利用职工学习时间开会检讨。现在把我们的检讨及今后改进办法奉上，请予刊登。
    （一）关于售票处未标明所售系那一路票的问题。以前我们曾经用纸写明贴在墙上，因日久失落，没有及时再行标明，致使旅客东奔西问。今后我们拟用磁漆在各售票口的玻璃上写明所售车票的路线和站名，避免旅客东奔西跑，影响候车室秩序。
    （二）本站售票员多是新任用人员，业务不熟习。我们领导上没有负责加以帮助与教育，以致售票员事先准备工作不够，售票时很缓，并经常发生对旅客态度不好现象。对此，我们诚恳接受批评，并在今后工作中改进。
    （三）关于车上没有标志，影响旅客上车事。这主要是春节前后旅客骤增，各线路都增加车辆，而车上的标志就不够用了。其根本原因是我们事先没有准备，没有计划，使旅客不知所从，秩序紊乱。我们认为这是很严重的缺点，今后当设专人负责维持秩序，给旅客作向导。
    （四）关于在站外停车及在车上售票的问题，主要由于本站制度不严，有时车辆过多，院内地方狭小。但领导上对此并不主动研究改善，同时验票员也没有负起责任来，给投机分子钻了空子。我们认为任杰同志提的意见非常宝贵，应该引起我们严重注意。
    （五）车上乘客过多现象，是由于我们片面地存在着满足旅客乘车的目的，而未考虑到旅客的安全。这就表现了我们对人民生命不够关心。今后我们一定实行定员制，保障旅客安全舒适。
    任杰同志对本站正确的批评，给我们指出改进工作的方向，使我们能进一步搞好人民运输事业。本站除对他表示谢意外，并希望广大群众能给本站多提意见。
                                            唐山汽车运输总站
