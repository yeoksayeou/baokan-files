　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th: According to a report from the Electric News Agency in Amsterdam: The Dutch people held the largest demonstration since the war on the 25th in Amsterdam to commemorate the heroes of the anti-Nazi movement in February 1941 and to protest the imperialists' rearming of the German executioners who had massacred the resistance fighters. The total number of demonstrators reached 75,000, and the line stretched for five kilometers, from the historically significant Waterloo Square—where the strike movement began—to the cemetery full of flowers dedicated to the heroes of the resistance movement. The march was jointly led by members of the Communist Party Central Committee, headed by Groot, and the February Strike Commemoration Committee.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th: London dispatch: A mass rally was held at Trafalgar Square in London on the 25th, hosted by the "Veterans' Movement for Peace" association, protesting the remilitarization of West Germany and Japan, and opposing the Attlee government's decision to conscript reservists for training. Several thousand people participated in the rally.
　　The veterans unanimously expressed strong anger at the war policies of the US-British bloc at the meeting. Former British Air Force Group Commander Turner declared at the meeting that he had decided to return the Distinguished Flying Cross awarded to him by the US government during World War II to Truman, stating: "I am not prepared to wear American medals like the murderers who are now in Korea." Another retired Air Force officer, Chiang Qi, called on veterans to "state very clearly: we do not want war and war provocations, we do not want to rearm Germany."
　　The conference unanimously passed a resolution opposing the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, opposing the release of German war criminals, opposing placing British troops under the command of foreign generals, and protesting the conscription of "Z" class reservists (i.e., World War II veterans).
　　Ignoring the government's ban on demonstrations, dozens of women marched to Trafalgar Square to participate in the protest rally. They held up signs reading: "Don't arm the Nazis!" "We want families, not bombs!" "Our children need peace!" Hundreds of police officers brutally charged into the ranks of the women and arrested eleven of them.

　 　荷兰人民反对武装西德
     七万五千人举行示威
     伦敦退伍军人集会抗议武装德日
    【新华社二十八日讯】据电通社阿姆斯特丹讯：荷兰人民为纪念一九四一年二月反纳粹运动的英雄们所举行的罢工，并抗议帝国主义重新武装曾屠杀过抵抗运动战士的德国刽子手，于二十五日在阿姆斯特丹举行了战后最大的一次示威游行。示威者总数达七万五千人，队伍绵延达五公里，从具有历史意义的滑铁卢广场——当年的罢工运动就在那儿开始——一直排到满堆着鲜花的抵抗运动英雄的公墓。这次游行是由以格鲁特为首的共产党中央委员会的委员们和二月罢工纪念委员会联合领导的。
    【新华社二十八日讯】伦敦讯：伦敦特拉法加广场于二十五日举行由“退伍军人保卫和平运动”协会主持的群众大会，抗议西德和日本的重新军国主义化，反对艾德礼政府征召后备军受训的决定。参加大会的有数千人。
    退伍军人们在会上一致表示对于美英集团战争政策的强烈愤怒。前英国空军大队指挥官特尔纳在会上宣称，他决定把第二次世界大战时美国政府授予他的光荣飞行十字勋章退还给杜鲁门，他声明：“我不准备同现在在朝鲜的杀人犯一样地佩带美国勋章。”另一个退伍空军军官蒋奇号召退伍军人“十分明确地表示：我们不要战争和战争挑拨，我们不要重新武装德国。”
    大会一致通过决议，反对重新武装西德和日本，反对释放德国战犯，反对把英国军队置于外国将领指挥之下，并抗议征召“Ｚ”级后备军（即第二次世界大战退伍军人）。
    数十名妇女不顾政府禁止示威游行的禁令，列队前往特拉法加广场参加抗议大会。她们高举标语牌，上面写着：“不要武装纳粹！”“要家庭，不要炸弹！”“我们的孩子们需要和平！”数百名警察横暴地冲入妇女的行列，并逮捕了十一名妇女。
