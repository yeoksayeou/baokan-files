　　Xinjiang province is self-sufficient in agricultural products, relies on other regions for industrial products, and has a large surplus of livestock and local products, which constitute the main wealth for exchanging for industrial products and account for a large proportion of the economy. Since liberation, in the past year, under the policy of the Provincial People's Government that "in order to stimulate the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts, it is necessary to promote the export of surplus goods and exchange for necessities to meet the needs of the people," the province's economy has been rapidly recovering and developing.

　　In the past year, due to the restoration of transportation between the East and West and the recovery and development of public and private commerce, Xinjiang's material circulation has taken on a new look, with the quantity of goods purchased by both public and private sectors being unprecedented in decades. In Dihua city alone, 570,000 bolts of cloth and 409,000 pieces of various brick tea were transported from various parts of the country. Taking the first quarter as the base period, cloth increased by 729% in the second quarter, tea increased by 2%; cloth increased by 4,415% in the third quarter, tea increased by 426%; and cloth increased by 1,618% in the two months of the fourth quarter, tea increased by 105%.

　　In the early days of liberation, Xinjiang's state-owned trade was very weak. After merging the pseudo-Northwest Minsheng Industrial Company and reorganizing the former Development Company under the revolutionary government of the Three Districts, grassroots organizations were gradually established. By the end of November last year, the establishment of branch companies in the ten special districts and thirty-five sub-branch companies stipulated by the policy guidelines had been completed. In addition, the China Fur Company also established a specialized branch company in Dihua, with a commercial network covering thirty-five counties, accounting for 47% of the total number of counties in the province. As for business operations, its development can be seen from the figures of the provincial trade company's investment and withdrawal. The second quarter increased by 987.7% compared to the first quarter, and the withdrawal increased by 493.4%. The third quarter continued to increase by 345.4% compared to the second quarter, and the withdrawal increased by 892.4%. In the fourth quarter, as of the end of October, the investment increased by 164.5% compared to the entire third quarter, and the withdrawal increased by 14.7% by the end of November. The turnover amount increased seven times compared to the original capital.

　　State-owned trading companies have played a leading role in the recovery and prosperity of Xinjiang's economy. The Xinjiang Provincial Trade Company (including the Dihua branch of the China Fur Company under its leadership) takes the purchase of agricultural and livestock products, vigorous development of trade with the Soviet Union, exchange for production equipment, and supply of people's necessities as its central business. According to incomplete statistics, the company purchased a total of 175 billion yuan (RMB) worth of cattle, sheep, fur, sheep intestines, wheat, and cotton from farmers and herdsmen throughout the year (including: 450,000 sheep, 26,000 cattle, 45,000 sheepskins, 3,400 tons of wool, 15,000 cattle and sheep hides, 220,000 lambskins, 5,000 animal skins, 450,000 sheep intestines, 120 tons of camel hair, 6,500 tons of wheat, 50,000 kilograms of cotton) and 26 other kinds of local products. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, these many local products were unprofitable for domestic sales and could not be exported, and most of them became waste, resulting in summer wool not being sheared and sheep intestines being fed to dogs, seriously damaging the people's income. Last year, after the vigorous purchase and export by state-owned trading companies, the vast number of people increased their income from the sale of local products by an amount equivalent to 460,000 bolts of blue cloth. In addition, the government raised the prices of agricultural and livestock products, narrowing the scissors difference with industrial products. For example, in December 1949, one bolt of blue cloth in Dihua city could be exchanged for 2,113 jin of wheat or 201.24 kilograms of wool; in November 1950, it had changed to only exchanging for 287.49 jin of wheat, a reduction of 635%, meaning that the comparative price of agricultural products increased by more than six times, and exchanging for 30 kilograms of wool, a reduction of 570%, meaning that the comparative price of livestock products increased by more than five times. As a result, the income of the vast number of people was further increased, encouraging the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.

　　In conjunction with the export of local products, state-owned trading companies have also exchanged for necessary equipment and materials for production and construction from the friendly Soviet Union. These materials accounted for 77% of the total import value for the year. Industrial raw materials such as steel, transportation tools such as transport vehicles, tire parts, health equipment such as medical equipment, as well as fuel, printing stationery paper, veterinary medicines, especially the materials urgently needed for agricultural construction in the province, such as water conservancy equipment, cement, large and small tractors, combines, various plows, spring harrows, zigzag harrows, various selection, distribution, sowing, harvesting, bundling, threshing, cotton ginning, disinfection machines, and more than 20 kinds of agricultural disinfection medicines. At the same time, state-owned trading companies also supplied the people of Xinjiang with cloth, tea, sugar and other daily necessities. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 6 million meters of Soviet cloth and domestic cloth, 800,000 kilograms of sugar, 70,000 pieces of brick tea, and many other general merchandise were sold throughout the year. Because Xinjiang is vast, rich in resources, and the people need to promote the sale of agricultural and livestock products and obtain necessary living and production materials, in addition to state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, private commerce also has a wide range of activities. Moreover, under the correct implementation of price policies by state-owned trading companies and the insistence on reasonable regional price differences, the transportation profits of private commerce are guaranteed (the wholesale price of state-owned trade is generally 6% lower than the retail price, and the overall purchase price of local products is increased by 4% compared to the retail price). Xinjiang's private commerce has seen rapid recovery and development. According to incomplete statistics, the number of industrial and commercial households in 32 counties and cities has increased from 29,931 in the early days of liberation to 30,798. Dihua city increased by 766 households, and Yili increased by 433 households. All industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and meet the needs of the people, such as water mills, timber, woodware, hardware and electrical materials, local products, cotton, rice and flour, leather, oil powder, iron and wood vehicle manufacturing, groceries, and general merchandise, are gradually increasing.

　　新疆经济在迅速恢复和发展中
      于先
    新疆省的农产品自给有余，工业品仰给外区，人民畜牧土产大量剩余，成为向外交换工业品的主要财富，在经济上占着极大比重。解放后，一年来，在该省人民政府“为了刺激农牧业及手工业的发展，就必须推销剩余物品出口，换回必需品，以供人民需要”的方针下，全省经济已在迅速恢复和发展。
    一年来，由于东西交通的恢复，公、私营商业的恢复与发展，新疆的物资调剂已出现了新的局面，公私进货数量之多，为十数年来所未有。仅是迪化市一地，自关内各地运进布匹五十七万匹，各种砖茶四十万九千片。以第一季度为基期，第二季度布增百分之七百二十九，茶增百分之二，第三季度布增百分之四千四百一十五，茶增百分之四百二十六，第四季度两个月布增百分之一千六百一十八，茶增百分之一百零五。
    在解放初期，新疆国营贸易是很微弱的，经过归并了伪西北民生实业公司，改组了三区革命政权下的前发展公司，逐渐建立了基层组织，至去年十一月底，已完成施政方针所规定的十个专区的分公司和三十五个支公司的建立。此外，中国皮毛公司也在迪化设立了一个专业分公司，商业网遍及了三十五县，占全省总县数的百分之四十七。至于业务经营，可以从省贸易公司投放和回笼的数字中看出它的发展。第二季度比第一季度投放增百分之九百八十七点七，回笼增百分之四百九十三点四，第三季度较第二季度续增投放百分之三百四十五点四，回笼百分之八百九十二点四，第四季度截至十月底投放较第三季度全季增百分之一百六十四点五，十一月底回笼增百分之一十四点七。周转金额较原来的资金增大了七倍。
    国营贸易公司对于新疆经济的恢复和繁荣，是起了主导作用的。新疆省贸易公司（包括在它领导下的中国皮毛公司迪化分公司）是把收购农、牧土产，大力发展对苏贸易，换进生产器材，以及供应人民必需品作为中心业务。据不完全统计，全年自农、牧民手中收购了总值人民币一千七百五十亿元的牛、羊、皮毛、羊肠、小麦、棉花（其中包括：羊四十五万只、牛二万六千头，羊皮四万五千张、羊毛三千四百吨、牛羊皮一万五千张、羊羔皮二十二万张、兽皮五千张、羊肠四十五万根、驼毛等一百二十吨、小麦六千五百吨，棉花五万公斤）及其他各种土产二十六种。这许多土产在国民党匪帮统治时期，内销无利，外输不能，大部分成为废物，以致夏毛不剪，羊肠喂狗，严重地损害了人民的收益。去年经国营贸易公司大力收购和输出后，使广大人民从出售土产上增加了约等于青蛙斜布四十六万匹的收入，再加上政府提高农、牧产品的价格，缩小了与工业品的剪刀差。如一九四九年十二月迪化市一匹青布换小麦二、一一三市斤，换羊毛二○一·二四公斤；一九五○年十一月，已经变为只换小麦二八七·四九市斤，缩小百分之六百三十五，即农产品的比价提高了六倍多，换羊毛三十公斤，缩小了百分之五百七十，即牧产品的比价提高了五倍多。因而更增加了广大人民的收益，鼓励了农、牧业的发展。
    与输出土产相结合，国营贸易公司又从友邦苏联换进了生产建设的必要器材物资。这些物资占全年进口总值百分之七十七。工业原料的钢铁，交通工具的运输汽车、轮胎零件，卫生设备的医药器械，以及油料、印刷文具纸张、兽医药品，特别是目前该省农业建设所急需的物资，如水利器材、水泥、大小拖拉机、大康拜因、各种耕犁、弹簧耙、之字耙、各种选种、分种、播种、收割、捆、打、清花、消毒机，及各种农业消毒药品二十余种。同时，国营贸易公司还供应了新疆人民以布、茶、糖及其他生活必需品。据不完全统计，全年销售出苏联布匹和本国布匹合计达六百万米，糖八十万公斤，砖茶七万片，以及百货等甚多。由于新疆地区辽阔，物产丰盛，人民又需要推销农、牧产品，和获得必需的生活、生产资料，因此，除国营贸易公司、合作社外，私营商业也有着宽阔的活动范围。而且在国营贸易公司正确执行价格政策、坚持合理地区差价下，保证了私营商业的贩运利益（国营贸易的批发价一般地低于零售价百分之六，并将土产整收价比零售价提高百分之四）。新疆的私营商业，已有迅速的恢复和发展。据不完全统计，三十二个县、市工商业户数，已由解放初期二九、九三一户增加到三○、七九八户。迪化市增加了七六六户，伊犁增加了四三三户。凡有益国计民生切合人民需要的如水磨、木料、木器、五金电料、土产、棉花、米面、皮革、油粉、铁木造车、杂货、百货都在逐渐增长。
