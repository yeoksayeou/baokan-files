　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the United States, plagued by inflation, prices continue to rise in a straight line. According to the Associated Press, citing the habitually scaled-down figures of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. cost of living index for February of this year rose another 1.4 percent compared to January, reaching 184.2 percent of the 1935-1939 base, setting a new record. Since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the cost of living index has increased by a total of 8.2 percent.
    Wholesale prices rose 1.9 percent in the one month from January to February, an increase of 16.7 percent compared to before the outbreak of the Korean War last June. Among these, the price of food, which accounts for the largest portion of spending by the general public, rose 3 percent in one month. In March, U.S. prices continued to rise. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' wholesale price index on March 20 was at "a record high" again.
    At the same time, due to the government's policy of freezing wages, workers' wages cannot be increased accordingly.

　　美国物价继续上涨
    工人实际工资减少
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在为通货膨胀所苦的美国，物价在继续直线式地上升。据美联社引美国劳工统计局照例缩小了的数字，美国今年二月的生活费指数又较一月上升了百分之一点四，已达到一九三五—一九三九年基数的百分之一百八十四点二，再创新记录。自美国发动侵朝战争以来，生活费指数总计已上涨了百分之八点二。
    批发价格从一月到二月的一个月中，上涨了百分之一点九。比去年六月朝鲜战争爆发前上涨了百分之十六点七。其中，占广大人民最大部分开支的粮食的价格，在一个月中上升了百分之三。三月份，美国的物价继续上升。劳工统计局三月二十日的批发物价指数，又是“破记录的高度”。
    与此同时，由于政府施行冻结工资的政策，工人的工资却不能得到相应的增加。
