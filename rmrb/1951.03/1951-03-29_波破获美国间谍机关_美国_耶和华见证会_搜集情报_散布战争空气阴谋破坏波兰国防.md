　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 27th: According to TASS, Polish public security organs have uncovered an American spy agency - "Jehovah's Witnesses." The leading body of the organization was located in Lodz and was directly led by the "Jehovah's Witnesses" headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. The head of the headquarters is an American named Knoll. Representatives from the American headquarters frequently came to Poland, and they used their stay in Poland to organize spy networks and collect intelligence in various places. Two American special agents, Begunik and Mohaliuk, who came to Poland in 1945, were particularly active.
　　Polish public security organs seized many charts in the meeting places of "Jehovah's Witnesses," marking the locations of military targets, troops, state organs, various factories, and radio stations. At the same time, they also seized intelligence they had collected on production and lists of personnel. The investigation confirmed that the missionaries of "Jehovah's Witnesses" used their travels to various places to collect military, economic, and political intelligence. The spy network of the organization spread war atmosphere everywhere, carried out propaganda against labor discipline and labor emulation, attempted to sabotage Poland's national defense, and create chaos in Poland.
　　The Warsaw Military Tribunal publicly tried seven American special agents, including Szczerda, the vice president of "Jehovah's Witnesses," from the 19th to the 23rd. Witnesses from the church testified in court, confirming the crimes of these special agents and exposing their despicable means of using church members for espionage activities. The special agents have confessed to their crimes. On the 23rd, the Warsaw Military Tribunal sentenced Szczerda to life imprisonment, and the other six special agents were sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to fifteen years.

    散布战争空气阴谋破坏波兰国防
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰公安机关破获了一个美国间谍机关——“耶和华见证会”。该会的领导机关设在罗兹，受纽约布鲁克林区的“耶和华见证会”总会直接领导，总会的主持人是美国人诺尔。美国的总会经常派代表到波兰来，他们利用在波兰逗留的机会在各地组织间谍网和收集情报，其中特别活跃的是一九四五年来波兰的两个美国特务贝古尼克和谟哈留克。
    波兰公安机关在“耶和华见证会”的会所内查获许多图表，上面标着军事目标、部队、国家机关、各种工厂及电台的所在地；同时并查获了他们收集的生产方面的情报及机关人员的名单。侦察的结果证实：“耶和华见证会”的传教士利用在各地旅行的机会，搜集军事、经济和政治情报，该会的间谍小组网四处散布战争空气，进行反对劳动纪律和劳动竞赛的宣传，企图破坏波兰的国防，并在波兰造成混乱。
    华沙军事法庭于十九日至二十三日公开审讯了“耶和华见证会”的副会长斯柴德等七名美国特务。该会的教徒在出庭作证时，证实了这些特务的罪行，揭露了他们利用教徒进行间谍活动的卑劣手段，特务们已对所犯罪行服罪。华沙军事法庭于二十三日宣判，判处斯柴德无期徒刑，其他六名特务分别判处五年到十五年的有期徒刑。
