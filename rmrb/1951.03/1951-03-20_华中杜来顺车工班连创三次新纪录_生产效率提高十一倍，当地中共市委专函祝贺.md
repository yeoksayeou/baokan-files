　　Hua Zhong’s Du Laishun Lathe Team Continuously Sets Three New Records
    Production Efficiency Increases Elevenfold, Local Municipal Party Committee Sends Letter of Congratulations
    Since the Du Laishun Lathe Team of the Hua Zhong Iron and Steel Company's Machinery Plant accepted the challenge from the Ma Hengchang Team, it has continuously set three new records. The time required to lathe a mine car wheel has been reduced from three hours to fifteen minutes, increasing production efficiency by elevenfold. The local Municipal Party Committee where the factory is located sent a special letter of congratulations for this achievement.
    The original planned time for the team to lathe a mine car wheel was three hours. After accepting the challenge, and through learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Team and implementing the assembly line method, the time was first reduced to one hour and forty minutes, and then further reduced to fifty-five minutes. Subsequently, worker Chen Xi'an further utilized the tool preparation time during the cutting process, and for the third time created a new record, able to lathe a mine car wheel in just fifteen minutes. Due to the increase in production efficiency, by February 19th, the man-hours spent by the team on manufacturing mine car parts only accounted for 24.6% of the administrative estimate.
    In order to achieve the challenge condition of a 99%合格 rate in product quality, the Du Laishun Lathe Team also selected two dedicated personnel to regularly check drawings and implement a finished product inspection system. At the same time, they voluntarily established a production responsibility system, with each person's work marked with a number to clearly distinguish good from bad, allowing for mutual comparison and encouragement. In addition, the team established a machine responsibility system, with a dedicated person cleaning each machine once a day. Inspections were also conducted at the beginning and end of each shift, and wooden boards were installed on the lathes to prevent careless banging and knocking on the machines. Labor discipline within the team has also improved. Workers now refrain from washing their hands before the end of the shift and avoid idle chatter during work hours. They have also established cartoon, slogan, and reporting groups to divide labor and cooperate in carrying out current affairs propaganda and production mobilization.

　　华中杜来顺车工班连创三次新纪录
    生产效率提高十一倍，当地中共市委专函祝贺
    华中钢铁公司机械厂杜来顺车工班向马恒昌小组应战以来，已连创三次新纪录，车一个矿车轮需用的时间由三小时降低到十五分钟，生产效率提高了十一倍。该厂所在地的中共市委会为此曾专函致贺。
    该班车一个矿车轮的时间，原计划为三小时，应战后由于学习马恒昌小组经验，实行流水作业法，首先缩短到一点四十分钟，接着又缩短到五十五分钟。其后，工人陈喜安更利用走刀时间准备工具，而第三次创造新纪录，用十五分钟就能车一个矿车轮。由于生产效率的提高，到二月十九日止，该班所做矿车零件用去的工时，仅及行政上估工的百分之二十四点六。
    为了实现产品质量合格率达到百分之九十九的应战条件，杜来顺车工班还推选了两个专人，经常核对图纸，执行成品检查制度；同时又自动建立了生产责任制，每个人做的活都打上号码，使好坏分明，得以互相比较，互相鼓励。此外，该班还建立了机器负责制度，每天由专人清洗一次，而且上下班都实行检查，并在车床上装上木板，做到不在车床上乱打乱敲。班内劳动纪律也有改进，现已作到不到下班时间不洗手，工作时间不闲谈。他们还成立了漫画、标语、口号和报道等小组，分工合作，搞好时事宣传和生产鼓动。
