　　The Japanese Communist Party Provisional Central Guidance Department Calls on Japanese Workers
    Strengthen Japan's World Federation of Trade Unions Movement
    Strive for an Overall Peace Treaty and Oppose Rearmament
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] The "Party News Bulletin" published by the Japanese Communist Party on February 25th published a statement by the Japanese Communist Party Provisional Central Guidance Department entitled "Strengthen the World Federation of Trade Unions Movement! - The Japanese Question and the World Federation of Trade Unions -." The statement clarifies the Communist Party's policy on Japan's World Federation of Trade Unions movement and calls on the Japanese working class to fight for an overall peace treaty with Japan and against rearmament.
    The statement begins by stating: The resolution "On the Tasks of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the Struggle to Defend Peace," adopted by the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions at the Bucharest Conference, pays special attention to the Japanese question. The resolution recommends struggling against actions to rearm West Germany and Japan. The Executive Bureau meeting unanimously endorsed the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress, including the resolution "to conclude peace treaties with a unified, non-militarized Germany and Japan and to withdraw the occupying forces from those two countries."
    The statement continues: The purpose of forcibly disbanding the Japan National Trade Union Liaison Council (referred to as "Zenroren") is to cut off the connection between Japanese workers and the World Federation of Trade Unions, thereby selling Japanese workers to a small group of servants of international monopoly capitalists under the name of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." After "Zenroren" was disbanded, Japanese workers, despite the authorities' continued attacks on them, took a step forward in carrying out the struggle for the World Federation of Trade Unions movement.
    Throughout the entire process of the struggle, the united strength of the workers has shattered the suggestions of "cooperation with the United Nations" and "striving for a separate peace treaty and rearmament for Japan" put forward and supported by the rebellious "Democratization League" splinter faction leaders. In Japan, almost no trade union is willing to openly support this kind of traitorous suggestion. The vast majority of Japanese workers demand the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and the elimination of militarism, demanding peace and national independence. This victory of our united policy aimed at achieving national unity and peace is also the movement of Japanese workers joining the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is the victory of Japanese workers.
    The statement points out: The key to strengthening the World Federation of Trade Unions movement lies in striving to fight for an overall peace treaty with Japan, thereby defending peace and achieving national independence. In other words, the way is for workers to actively participate in the peace treaty signature campaign and to strengthen and expand the democratic national front based on the leadership of the working class. The second way to strengthen the World Federation of Trade Unions movement is to mobilize workers to rise up in a daily and active atmosphere of struggle, to fight for a reasonable life and freedom, and to raise this struggle to the level of a conscious mass struggle against the conspiracy of separate peace and against the rearmament of Japan.
    The statement finally calls on party organizations at all levels of the Japanese Communist Party to pay closer attention to the activities of the Japan World Federation of Trade Unions Liaison Bureau, and to proactively distribute publications related to the World Federation of Trade Unions among workers, thereby deepening workers' understanding of the significance of the World Federation of Trade Unions movement.

### 日共临时中央指导部号召日本工人  加强日本的世界工联运动  努力争取全面和约与反对重新武装

　　日共临时中央指导部号召日本工人
    加强日本的世界工联运动
    努力争取全面和约与反对重新武装
    【新华社二十二日讯】日本共产党刊行的《党的新闻公报》，于二月二十五日登载日共临时中央指导部发表的题为“加强世界工联运动！——日本问题与世界工联——”的声明。该声明阐明共产党对日本的世界工联运动的政策，并号召日本工人阶级为争取全面对日和约与反对重新武装而斗争。
    声明首称：世界工会联合会执行局布加勒斯特会议所通过的《关于世界工联在为保卫和平而斗争中的任务的决议》，特别注意日本问题。决议建议与重新武装西德和日本的行动作斗争。执行局会议一致赞同第二届世界和平大会的各项决议，包括“与统一的、非军国主义化的德国和日本缔结和约，并从该两国撤退占领军”的决议在内。
    声明继称：强迫解散日本全国工会联络协议会（简称《全劳联》）的目的，在于切断日本工人和世界工联的联系，从而把日本工人出卖给名为《国际自由工会联合会》的国际垄断资本家的一小群仆从。在《全劳联》被解散以后，日本工人不顾当局对他们的继续进攻，把开展世界工联运动的斗争向前推进了一步。
    在进行斗争的全部过程中，工人的联合力量已粉碎叛逆的“民主化同盟”分裂分子领袖所提出和支持的“与联合国合作”和“为日本争取缔结单独和约和重新武装”的建议。在日本，几乎没有一个工会愿意公开支持这种卖国的建议。绝大多数的日本工人要求缔结全面和约与肃清军国主义，要求和平与民族独立。以取得全国的团结与和平为目标的我们的团结政策的这种胜利，也就是日本工人参加了世界工联的运动，也就是日本工人的胜利。
    声明指出：加强世界工联运动的关键，在于努力为争取全面对日和约而斗争，借以保卫和平和获得民族独立。换句话说，办法是要工人积极参加和约签名运动，并以工人阶级的领导为基础加强和扩大民主民族战线。加强世界工联运动的第二个办法是鼓动工人起来在日常的活跃的斗争气氛中，为争取合理的生活和自由而战斗，并把这种斗争提高到反对单独媾和的阴谋和反对重新武装日本的自觉的群众斗争水平。
    声明最后号召日共各级党组织加强注意日本世界工联联络事务局的活动，主动地把有关世界工联的刊物散发到工人中间去，从而加深工人对世界工联运动的意义的认识。
