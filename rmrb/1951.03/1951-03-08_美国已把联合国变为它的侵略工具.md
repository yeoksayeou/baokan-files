　　The United States Has Turned the United Nations into Its Tool of Aggression

　　After the end of the Second World War, the allied countries participating in the anti-fascist war, in order to consolidate and develop wartime cooperation, and to assume the major responsibility of maintaining world peace and international security, established an international organization based on the principle of equality of rights among all countries – the United Nations – through agreement.

　　The Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world attached great importance to this international organization. Stalin pointed out in 1946: "I think the United Nations is extremely important, because it is an important tool for maintaining peace and international security. The strength of the international organization lies in the fact that it is based on the principle of equality of all countries, and not on the principle of some countries dominating other countries. If the United Nations can also succeed in maintaining the principle of equality in the future, then it will undoubtedly play a major and positive role in ensuring world peace and security."

　　The principle of unanimity among the great powers and the principle of equality of rights among all countries are the two main pillars of the United Nations organization. The former is specifically stipulated in Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter, which states that for the adoption of non-procedural matters in the Security Council, the affirmative votes of seven of the eleven member states must include the concurring votes of all permanent members (the five powers); the latter is specifically stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the United Nations Charter: The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. The principle of unanimity among the great powers and the sovereign equality of all member states are not contradictory. Without the principle of unanimity among the great powers, the sovereign equality of all countries would be meaningless. Soviet international law expert Kozyunov wrote in "Stalin on the Basic Principles of Modern International Law": "The Leninist-Stalinist doctrine of national independence and equality is by no means the meaning of the abstract principles of sovereignty and national equality." "The Soviet view on the issue of national equality is based on the recognition of the principle of combining rights and obligations, for example, this principle is reflected in the Soviet Union's position on the so-called 'veto power' in the United Nations Security Council." Comrade Stalin made a very appropriate analogy in his interview with a reporter from Pravda, he said: "For example, the small American Republic of Dominica, with a population of nearly two million, now has the same proportion in the United Nations as India, and that proportion is much greater than that of the People's Republic of China, which has been deprived of the right to vote in the United Nations."

　　The Soviet Union has consistently fought to uphold the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, so that it conforms to the purpose of the United Nations at the time of its creation – to ensure international peace and security. At the same time, this is also the common expectation of peace-loving people all over the world for the United Nations. The Soviet representatives have repeatedly put forward various peace proposals on concluding peace treaties, reducing armaments, and banning atomic weapons at the various sessions of the United Nations. However, these proposals have been violently sabotaged by the American aggression group. In order to establish its rule over the world, American imperialism has consistently undermined these principles, used its "voting machine" in the United Nations, and attempted to turn the United Nations into an appendage of the US State Department and a tool for launching wars of aggression. However, the principle of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council is a serious obstacle to the United States' use of the United Nations. Therefore, since the San Francisco Conference in 1945, the United States has been plotting to undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers, and in the second United Nations General Assembly, it openly used its voting machine to illegally pass the so-called "Peace and Security Committee" (i.e., the "Small General Assembly"), attempting to usurp the power of the Security Council. However, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries firmly refused to participate in this illegal organization, and the United States' conspiracy failed.

　　Because the United States is following this shameful path, after the formal establishment of the Central People's Government of China, it has tried its best to prevent our country's legal representatives from entering the United Nations, while retaining the illegal "representatives" of the Kuomintang remnants who were spurned by the 475 million Chinese people. This barbarous act of the United States in hijacking the United Nations and disregarding the legitimate rights of the Chinese people has been universally condemned by peace-loving people all over the world. Excluding the legal representatives of the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, from the United Nations shows that the United Nations has embarked on the road of becoming a tool of American aggression.

　　On June 25 last year, the Syngman Rhee bandit army of South Korea, under the direction of the United States, invaded north of the "38th parallel." On the same day, the United States took advantage of the absence of representatives from the two permanent members of the Security Council – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China – to manipulate its voting machine and pass an illegal resolution, placing the blame for "aggression" on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a pretext for invading the Korean people. Then, the United States used the Security Council to collect cannon fodder from its vassal states, and used the flag of the United Nations to cover up the bloody crimes of the United States' aggression against Korea. As pointed out in the "Resolution on the United Nations" of the First Session of the World Peace Council: "The United Nations, with its authority, has approved and covered up the systematic massacre of nearly one million people by the American army in Korea, including the elderly, women and children, and has destroyed and burned Korean cities and villages, turning them into rubble."

　　In August last year, the Soviet representative returned to the United Nations Security Council, and because of the principle of unanimity among the great powers, it became impossible for American imperialism to continue to use the Security Council.

　　However, American imperialism was not reconciled to this, and the evil deeds of continuing to manipulate the United Nations were being intensified. On the second day of the opening of the Fifth United Nations General Assembly, under the instigation of the United States, it roped in six other vassal states (Britain, Canada, Turkey, the Philippines, France and Uruguay) to propose the so-called "United Action for Peace." The purpose of this proposal was not only to circumvent the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council, but also to illegally grant the United Nations General Assembly the powers that originally belonged to the Security Council and that the General Assembly did not have and should not have. In this way, American imperialism could use its "voting machine" to illegally stamp the "legal" seal on American acts of aggression in so-called special meetings within 24 hours, covering up its crimes of aggression under the banner of the United Nations, as in Korea. This proposal was passed under the manipulation of the United States, despite the firm opposition of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This made it possible for the United States to further use the United Nations as its tool of aggression.

　　After the American aggressor troops were badly defeated by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, American imperialism, in order to save its tarnished "reputation," attempted to deceive the people at home and abroad and continue its aggressive activities, and put forward a slanderous proposal to declare our country an "aggressor," attempting to portray its illegal aggression in Korea as "defense," and to slander our people's great just action in helping the Korean people resist American aggression as "aggression." This shameful proposal was passed by the United Nations General Assembly on February 1 this year under the crude pressure of the United States.

　　Foreign Minister Zhou issued a statement on February 2 in this regard, clearly exposing the American conspiracy to place the blame for "aggression" on our country. The statement pointed out: "The attempt of American imperialism is to continue to occupy Korea and Taiwan, interfere in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, conduct separate peace treaties with Japan and rearm Japan, and coordinate with its rearmament of West Germany in the West, and drive the people of Asia, Europe and the world into the abyss of war, in order to realize its dream of dominating the world."

　　This illegal decision of the United Nations General Assembly to slander our country is a thorough reversal of right and wrong and a complete loss of conscience, and has aroused unanimous anger and condemnation from just people all over the world. The World Peace Council, representing the will of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people, pointed out that this shameful resolution of the United Nations General Assembly is "unjust and illegal," and believes that "this decision seriously hinders the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and creates the threat of expanding the war in the Far East, and thus also creates the danger of the outbreak of another world war," and demands that the United Nations revoke this resolution.

　　The United Nations has embarked on a shameful road and has become an appendage of the US State Department. American imperialism has barbarously undermined the principle of unanimity among the great powers and has manipulated its "voting machine," which is the core of aggression pointed out by Stalin – the ten countries participating in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the twenty Latin American countries. Therefore, the United Nations is no longer an international organization that maintains international peace and security and ensures the equality of rights among all countries, but is "increasingly becoming a tool of war." "Now the United Nations is less a world organization than an organization of Americans that caters to the needs of American aggressors" (Stalin).

　　The disappointment of the peace-loving people of the world in the United Nations has prompted them to rise up and take on the cause of maintaining peace themselves. The Second World Peace Congress, attended by representatives of the people of 80 countries, pointed out in its "Letter to the United Nations": "We ask it (referring to the United Nations – author's note) to note that we have established a World Peace Council, which is a group of representatives of the people of all countries in the world, including representatives of member states and non-member states of the United Nations, as well as representatives of dependent countries and colonies. … The World Peace Council undertakes the lofty mission of ensuring the consolidation of lasting peace in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries." The First Session of the World Peace Council passed a series of important resolutions on maintaining peace and preventing war. The peace-loving people of all countries unanimously support these resolutions and express their willingness to fight for their complete realization. This confirms that the World Peace Council is a powerful organization capable of realizing the human desire for peace. It has become the command post for the organized, peace-loving humanity to fight for peace, and has won the trust of the people all over the world who have lost confidence in the United Nations. Hundreds of millions of peace advocates around the world are uniting under the banner of the World Peace Council to fight for the cause of maintaining world peace.

### 美国已把联合国变为它的侵略工具

　　美国已把联合国变为它的侵略工具
    第二次世界大战结束以后，参加反法西斯战争的各个盟国，为了巩固与发展战时的合作，并担负起维护世界和平与国际安全的重大责任，经过协议成立了以各国权利平等为原则的国际组织——联合国。
    苏联与全世界爱好和平的人民，都十分重视这个国际组织。斯大林在一九四六年曾经指出：“我认为联合国组织是极端重要的，因为它是维持和平与国际安全的一个重要的工具。国际组织的力量，存在于这样的一件事实：就是它是建立在各国平等的原则的上面，而不是建立在某些国家支配其他国家的原则的上面。假若联合国组织将来在维持平等的原则上也是成功的话，那么，它在保障世界的和平与安全的上面，无疑地将要担任一个重大的积极的任务。”
    大国一致与各国权利平等的原则，是联合国组织的两大支柱。前者具体地规定在联合国宪章第二十七条第三款，关于安全理事会中对于非程序问题的通过，在十一个理事国的七理事国的可决票中，必须包括全体常任理事国（五国）之同意票；后者具体地规定在联合国宪章第二条第一款：本组织系基于各会员国主权平等之原则。大国一致原则与各会员国之主权平等是并不矛盾的，如果没有大国一致原则，各国主权平等就会毫无实际意义了。苏联国际法专家柯席乌尼科夫在“斯大林论现代国际法的基本原则”一文中写道：“列宁——斯大林对国家独立与平权的学说，完全不是主权与国家平等的抽象原则的意义。”“对于国家平等问题的苏维埃观点，是以承认结合权利与义务的原则为根据的，例如这个原则即反映在苏联对联合国组织安全理事会中所谓‘否决权’的立场。”斯大林同志在答真理报记者的谈话中，更作了十分恰当的比喻，他说：“例如，美洲小小的多米尼加共和国，人口几乎不足二百万，但现在却在联合国中与印度占有同样的比重，而比起在联合国中被剥夺了表决权的中华人民共和国，那比重就更大得多了。”
    苏联一贯为维护联合国宪章的基本原则而斗争，使它符合于联合国在创立时的宗旨——保障国际的和平与安全。同时，这也是全世界爱好和平人民对联合国的共同期望。苏联代表在联合国的历届会议中，曾多次提出了关于缔结和平公约、裁减军备、禁止原子武器的各项和平建议。但这些建议却都遭到了美国侵略集团横暴的破坏。美帝国主义为了要建立对全世界的统治，一贯地破坏这些原则，利用它在联合国中的“表决机器”，企图变联合国为美国国务院的附属机构，变联合国为发动侵略战争的工具。可是，安理会中常任理事国一致的原则，是美国利用联合国的严重障碍，因此自一九四五年旧金山会议以来，美国就一直阴谋破坏大国一致的原则，并在第二届联合国大会中公然利用其表决机器，非法通过设立所谓“和平安全委员会”（即“小型联大”），企图篡夺安理会的权力。但是苏联和各人民民主国家坚决拒绝参加这一非法组织，美国的阴谋因而未能得逞。
    由于美国遵循着这一条可耻的道路，所以在我中央人民政府正式成立以后，它就极力阻挠我国的合法代表进入联合国，而容留了为四亿七千五百万中国人民所唾弃的国民党残匪的非法“代表”。美国劫持联合国，无视中国人民合法权利的这一横蛮行为，受到了世界爱好和平人民的普遍谴责。把占世界四分之一人口的中国人民的合法代表排拒在联合国之外，这就表明联合国已走上了作为美国的侵略工具的道路。
    去年六月二十五日，南朝鲜的李承晚匪军，在美国的指使之下，向“三八线”以北进犯。就在这一天，美国便利用安理会中两个常任理事国——苏联和中华人民共和国代表没有出席的时机，操纵它的表决机器，通过非法决议，把“侵略”的罪名加诸朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，作为侵略朝鲜人民的借口。接着，美国又利用安理会向它的仆从国家搜罗炮灰，更使用联合国的旗帜，来掩盖美国侵略朝鲜的血腥罪行。正如世界和平理事会第一届会议“关于联合国的决议”中所指出的一样：“联合国以它的权威批准和掩护美国军队在朝鲜有系统地杀害近一百万人，其中包括老人、妇女和儿童，并且摧毁和焚烧了朝鲜的城市和乡村，使之化为灰砾。”
    去年八月，苏联代表回到了联合国安理会，因为有大国一致原则的缘故，使美帝国主义不可能继续利用安理会。
    但是，美帝国主义并不就此甘心，继续操纵联合国的恶行仍在加紧着。在第五届联合国大会开幕的第二天，在美国的主谋下，拉拢了其他六个仆从国家（英、加、土、菲、法及乌拉圭）提出了所谓“保障和平联合行动”案。这一提案的目的，不但要规避安理会中大国一致的原则，而且将本来属于安理会的职权而为大会所没有也不应有的职权，非法地给予了联合国大会。这样，美国帝国主义就可利用其“表决机器”在二十四小时以内把美国的侵略行为，在所谓特别的会议上非法地盖上“合法”的图章，像在朝鲜一样以联合国的旗帜掩盖其侵略罪行。这一提案竟不顾苏联及人民民主国家的坚决反对，在美国操纵之下被通过了。这样，就使得美国有可能进一步利用联合国作为它的侵略工具。
    美国侵略军在朝鲜被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打得落花流水之后，美国帝国主义为了挽救它的狼藉的“声誉”，企图欺骗国内外人民，继续进行侵略的勾当，提出宣布我国为“侵略者”的诽谤案，企图把它自己在朝鲜所进行的非法侵略，说成“防御”，而把我国人民援助朝鲜人民抗击美国侵略者的伟大正义行动，诬为“侵略”。这个可耻的提案，在美国粗暴的压力之下，竟被联合国大会于今年二月一日通过了。
    周外长于二月二日为此发表声明，明白地揭露了美国把“侵略”罪名加于我国的阴谋，声明指出：“美国帝国主义的企图是：继续侵占朝鲜和台湾，干涉越南和东南亚，进行单独对日缔约和重新武装日本，配合它在西方重新武装西德，并将亚洲、欧洲及世界人民驱入战争深渊，以遂其独霸世界的迷梦。”
    联合国大会这一诬蔑我国的非法决定，是彻头彻尾的颠倒黑白、丧尽天良的行为，因而引起了全世界正义人民一致的愤怒和斥责。代表亿万和平人民意志的世界和平理事会，指出联合国大会这一可耻的决议是“不公正而且非法”，认为“这个决定严重地妨碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，并造成扩大远东战争的威胁，因而也造成另一次世界大战爆发的危险”，并要求联合国取消这一决议。
    联合国已走上了可耻的道路，成为美国国务院的附属机构。美帝国主义横蛮地破坏了大国一致的原则，并且操纵了它的“表决机器”，就是斯大林所指出的侵略核心——十个参加侵略性北大西洋公约的国家，与二十个拉丁美洲国家。因此联合国已经不是维护国际和平与安全的、各国权利平等的国际组织，而“日益变成战争的工具”了。“现在联合国与其说是世界性组织，还不如说是迎合美国侵略者需要的美洲人的组织”（斯大林语）。
    世界爱好和平人民对于联合国的失望，促使他们自己奋起担当起维护和平的事业。八十个国家人民代表参加的二届世界和平大会，在它的“致联合国书”中指出：“我们请它（指联合国——作者引注）注意，我们已经设立了一个世界和平理事会，这是一个包括世界各国人民的代表的团体，其中有联合国会员国和非会员国的代表，以及附属国和殖民地国家的代表。……世界和平理事会担负着符合各国人民切身利益，确保巩固与持久和平的崇高任务。”世界和平理事会第一届会议通过了一系列维护和平、制止战争的重要决议。各国爱好和平的人民一致拥护这些决议，并表示愿为其彻底实现而奋斗。这就证实了世界和平理事会是能够实现人类和平意愿的强大组织。它已成为有组织的、爱好和平人类为和平而斗争的司令台，取得了对联合国业已丧失信心的全世界人民的信任。全世界亿万的和平拥护者，正团结在世界和平理事会的旗帜下，为维护世界和平的事业而展开斗争。
