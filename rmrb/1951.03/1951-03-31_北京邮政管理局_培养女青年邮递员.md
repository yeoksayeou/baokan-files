Beijing Postal Administration
    Cultivates Young Female Postal Workers
    The Beijing Postal Administration has begun to train young female postal workers. Starting from March 1st, they began studying in the delivery group of the bureau. Members of the delivery group explained basic postal knowledge to them, explaining the specific process from receiving letters to delivering them to the recipient, and explaining how to be quick, skillful, and meticulous in this receiving and dispatching process without making mistakes. To combine theory with practice, each of them was led by a delivery group member to understand the detailed process of picking up mail, stamping, sorting routes, picking letters, arranging letters, registering, counting, and packing in various tasks in the field. After they gained basic knowledge of these internal tasks, they further began to follow the postal workers on shifts for practical training from March 12th.
    Now, these future female postal workers, wearing new green uniforms and riding green bicycles, are speeding through the streets of Beijing, following skilled old postal workers to deliver letters to various homes. The appearance of female postal workers is a first in Beijing. At the same time, the appearance of female postal workers has opened up a new career path for women in New China.

    培养女青年邮递员
    北京邮政管理局开始培养女青年邮递员，从三月一日起开始在局里投递组学习，由投递组员给她们讲解邮政业务常识，讲解从收取信件起直到送达收件人止的具体过程，并讲解怎样在这个收发过程中做到眼快、手灵、脑细的地步而不出差错。为使理论与实际相结合，她们各由一个投递组员带领着，在取信、盖戳、分道、拣信、排信、挂号、记数、装包等各项工作中实地去了解它的细致的过程。当她们对这些内部工作获得了基本的知识后，进一步从三月十二日起开始分别跟随邮递员出班实习。
    现在，这些未来的女邮递员穿着新的绿色制服，骑着绿色自行车，在北京街道上驰过，跟着熟练的老邮递员往各家送信。女邮递员的出现在北京还是第一次。同时女邮递员的出现又给新中国妇女开辟了一条新的工作道路。
