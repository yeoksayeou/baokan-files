To the Editorial Comrades:

Comrade Kang Zhensheng, District Head of the Third District of Handan County, Hebei Province, has made principled errors in handling substitute farming work. I am writing down the specific situation below:

I. Bias in Implementing the Substitute Farming Policy: In Xisun Village of the district, there are two families of revolutionary soldiers (hereinafter referred to as military families). According to their labor capacity and other specific circumstances, they should not be eligible for substitute farming; however, the district approved substitute farming for a portion of their land. Another military family, seeing that two families with more resources than them were already enjoying substitute farming, kept going to District Head Kang Zhensheng and complaining about the unfairness of the village cadres. At this time, District Head Kang not only did not immediately correct the unreasonable phenomenon in substitute farming, but instead got angry with the military family requesting substitute farming. District Head Kang said, "The district decided not to give you substitute farming. If you want to complain, go to the county to complain about the district head." Precisely because District Head Kang did not correct the existing unreasonableness in substitute farming, he was unable to explain the reason for not approving substitute farming for the last military family. Under their persistent request, District Head Kang finally approved substitute farming for a portion of their land. In this way, District Head Kang continued to approve substitute farming for a portion of land for two other military families. Later, according to the research results of the Civil Affairs Section of the Handan County People's Government, it was believed that these five military families did not meet the substitute farming standards. This situation fully illustrates that District Head Kang Zhensheng lacks principle in implementing the substitute farming policy.

II. Not Accepting Instructions from Higher Authorities, Not Listening to the Opinions of the Masses, Acting Solely on Emotion. Zhao Yongxin, a military family member in the district, should have been entitled to full substitute farming. Last August, when the district inspected the substitute farming work, they suddenly reduced the substitute farming land by eight mu. After Zhao Yongxin reported this matter to the Civil Affairs Section of the county, the Civil Affairs Section called the Third District People's Government, explaining that Zhao Yongxin's family should enjoy full substitute farming. Later, the county head personally wrote a letter to the leading comrades of the Third District, asking them to study the problems in substitute farming. Zhao Yongxin himself also called District Head Kang, asking him to explain the reason for the reduction in farming. However, District Head Kang has never responded to this question, and it has been delayed for five or six months without a solution.

Editor's Note: Substitute farming is a form of social mutual assistance. Revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have dedicated their bodies and lives to the revolution, serving the people; therefore, revolutionary martyrs and military families who live in rural areas and lack labor should be provided with substitute farming assistance. However, martyrs' and military families with the ability to cultivate should be encouraged to work hard in production and should not enjoy substitute farming; because today the labor force of the masses is also lacking. However, District Head Kang Zhensheng of Handan's Third District acted in the opposite way in approving substitute farming households, the Zhao Yongxin family, who should have been approved for full substitute farming, has been delayed for five or six months without a solution; the five households that should not have been approved for substitute farming enjoyed substitute farming. Obviously, District Head Kang is without principle in implementing the substitute farming policy. This shows that District Head Kang has an insufficient understanding of the meaning of substitute farming, treating the socially mutual assistance of substitute farming as his own "favor" to martyrs' and military families, deciding everything based on his happiness, which is completely wrong.

Secondly, since the masses have reflected the situation and the higher authorities have also given instructions, but District Head Kang Zhensheng insists on not correcting his mistakes, this is a serious phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline and a bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses.

### 不按照劳力情况决定代耕  邯郸三区区长康振生应作检讨

    不按照劳力情况决定代耕
    邯郸三区区长康振生应作检讨编辑同志：
    河北省邯郸县第三区区长康振生同志，在处理代耕工作上是有原则性的错误的，现在我把具体情况写在下面：
    一、执行代耕政策有偏向：该区西孙庄有两家革命军人家属（以下简称军属），按照劳力等具体情况来说，都是不应享受代耕的；但是区里却批准给他们代耕一部分土地。另一家军属见到比他还有办法的两家已享受代耕，他也就不断去找区长康振生同志，并控告村干部的不公道。这时，康区长不但没有即时纠正代耕中的不合理现象；反而对要求代耕的军属发了脾气。康区长说：“不给你代耕是区里决定的，你要告状，到县里告区长好了。”也正因为康区长没有纠正代耕中既存的不合理，所以也就没法解答不批准后一家军属代耕的理由，在他坚持要求下，康区长终于批准了代耕一部分土地。就这样，康区长又继续批准了另外两家军属代耕一部分土地。后据邯郸县人民政府民政科研究的结果，认为这五家军属都是不合乎代耕标准的。这种情况，充分说明了康振生区长在执行代耕政策上是缺乏原则的。
    二、不接受上级指示，不听取群众意见，一味的感情用事。该区军属赵永信，本来是应该享受全部代耕的。去年八月间区里检查代耕工作，突然给减了代耕地八亩。赵永信将此事反映到县民政科以后，民政科打电话告诉第三区人民政府，说明赵永信家应该享受全部代耕。后来并经过县长亲自写信给第三区的领导同志，请他们研究代耕中的问题。赵永信本人也曾打电话请康区长说明减耕的理由。但是康区长对这个问题一直没有答复，就这样拖了五、六个月还没得到解决。

    编者按：代耕是一种社会互助。革命烈士和军人把他们的身体和生命都献给了革命，为人民服务；因此，对于居住农村而又缺乏劳动力的革命烈士、革命军人家属必须予以代耕帮助。但对于有耕种能力的烈、军属，则应鼓励其努力生产，不应享受代耕；因为今天群众的劳力也是缺乏的。但邯郸三区康振生区长在批准代耕户时，恰恰是和这个原则相反，该批准全部代耕的赵永信家，已经拖了五、六个月还未得到解决；不该批准代耕的五户，却享受了代耕。显然，康区长在执行代耕政策中，是毫无原则的。这说明了康区长对于代耕的意义认识不足，把社会互助性的代耕，作为自己对烈、军属的“恩赐”，一切决定于他的高兴，这是完全错误的。
    其次，群众既有反映，上级也有指示，但康振生区长却坚持不改自己的错误，这是严重的无组织无纪律现象和脱离群众的官僚主义作风。
