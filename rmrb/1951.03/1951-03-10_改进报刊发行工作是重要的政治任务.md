The newspaper and magazine distribution work conference convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government concluded on February 28th. This conference further resolved the existing guiding principles and policies in distribution work, determined the 1951 newspaper and magazine distribution plan, and appropriately strengthened the postal bureau's distribution organization, which will enable the future newspaper and magazine distribution work to have further development possibilities. In 1950, the various institutions of the postal system of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications achieved results in implementing the principle of "integration of postal delivery and distribution" (integrating postal work and newspaper and magazine distribution work). The total circulation of newspapers and periodicals nationwide in 1950 increased significantly. This, of course, relied on the efforts of other newspaper distribution agencies and bookstores, but it is inseparable from the fact that the postal bureau undertook the distribution of most newspapers and some periodicals. The newspapers currently distributed by the post office have increased from 73 to 140, accounting for more than 50 percent of the various newspapers nationwide; the number of copies distributed per issue has increased from nearly 800,000 to 2.2 million, accounting for more than 64 percent of the total newspaper circulation of 3.4 million nationwide. The periodicals distributed by the post office have increased from more than 30 to 122, with a circulation of over 900,000 copies. This conference determined that by the end of 1951, the post office would increase the circulation of newspapers by 1.2 million copies per issue and the circulation of periodicals by 700,000 copies, an increase of more than 55 percent and 77 percent respectively compared to 1950. This plan is likely to be completed with the joint efforts of national public and private distribution forces.

However, it must be pointed out that the above-mentioned distribution achievements and the planned distribution volume for 1951 are extremely disproportionate when compared with China's large population, vast area, the people's increasing awareness, and the country's economic and cultural recovery and development. It must not be considered that a "saturation point" has been reached. The Soviet Union, with a population of 200 million, distributes more than 33 million copies of newspapers daily, of which Pravda distributes more than 2.5 million copies daily. The Czech Republic, with a population of 12 million, also distributes 500,000 copies of Rudé Právo daily. The existing distribution scale in our country should be said to be very small. Of course, the size of circulation is most closely related to the level of economic, transportation, and cultural development of the country, and the quality of the newspapers and periodicals themselves, and cannot be entirely determined by population, region, and other conditions. However, there is no doubt that the quality of distribution work has a significant impact on distribution performance.

People's newspaper and magazine distribution work is essentially a work of ideological dissemination. The people's demand for people's newspapers and periodicals mainly stems from understanding the propositions, guidelines, and policies of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party on current major issues from the newspapers and periodicals, as well as the main work experiences of various regions, and using the newspapers to reflect their own demands and express their opinions. Therefore, people who can read newspapers certainly want to read them, and people who cannot understand them also want to listen to them. People's newspapers and periodicals are not dispensable reading materials for the people, but indispensable spiritual food. It is a broad and vital link for the absolutely indispensable mutual connection between leaders and the masses. There is no propaganda tool in the world that can influence the masses more massively, rapidly, and accurately than newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, distributing newspapers and periodicals is a serious political task. And the state of newspaper and magazine distribution work is an important issue of concern to the people of the whole country.

According to the materials from this Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications newspaper and magazine distribution conference, based on the work in 1950, the distribution work still needs and can be greatly improved. The key to improvement lies in two issues:

First, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "integration of postal delivery and distribution." The post office must be responsible for doing a good job in distributing most newspapers and some periodicals, just as bookstores are responsible for books and another part of periodicals. The increase in circulation and the expansion of the distribution area in 1950 have fully proved the correctness of the principle of having the post office lead the newspaper and magazine distribution work. In China, what private distribution agency can compare with the post office? First of all, there are currently more than 50,000 postal bureaus and offices nationwide, and the postal routes total more than 925,000 kilometers. Its branches are distributed throughout the country, with approximately 50,000 employees. It has unified national leadership and close coordination with other national transportation agencies. The post office itself also has many transportation tools. This is China's largest newspaper distribution agency today. Not only that, the post office is a socialist enterprise, and its purpose is to serve the country and the people. It should and is using business management methods to gradually reduce distribution costs and reduce the burden on readers. Moreover, under the leadership of the post office, all private, cooperative, and individual distribution forces can be united to jointly serve the distribution work. This is an unprecedented newspaper distribution lineup in Chinese history, which cannot be compared with any private distribution force. Therefore, regardless of whether there are some things in the current "integration of postal delivery and distribution" method that need to be considered and revised, as a distribution policy, the national newspapers should firmly implement the correct policy of "integration of postal delivery and distribution" and adopt a positive attitude towards the post office's distribution work. The distribution of periodicals should also be gradually expanded in a focused manner by handing it over to the post office.

On the other hand, post offices at all levels must seriously value distribution work. Among all postal workers, education on the importance of distribution work should be universally carried out. In the past year, the understanding of distribution work among postal workers nationwide has been uneven. In terms of leadership, the correct principle of "integration of postal delivery and distribution" was generally put forward, but the assistance to the actual work of the lower levels was not enough. In terms of various regions, some regions have made great achievements in distribution work, while some regions have made little progress. Even some postal workers mistakenly regard newspaper and magazine distribution work as "picking up a thin bone" and as a "money-losing" business. Therefore, they adopt a perfunctory attitude towards newspaper and magazine distribution work, do not care about the distribution department, do not solve practical difficulties, and do not check the distribution effect. This view does not recognize the importance of distribution work, does not understand the glorious position of the people's post office and the glorious tasks it should undertake, and is an erroneous "purely economic viewpoint." Not only that, after the post office is responsible for newspaper and magazine distribution, the content of the post office's own work has gradually changed, and newspaper and magazine distribution is rapidly occupying an important position in the business volume of the entire post office work. According to statistics at the end of 1950, the national post office delivered a total of more than 600 million letters, and if newspaper and magazine distribution is calculated based on December, it can reach more than 700 million copies throughout the year. This new business trend must be recognized by all postal workers, just like the new tasks.

The second issue in improving distribution work is to boldly strengthen the distribution force. Judging from the situation of the post office workers in 1950, the national distribution force is very insufficient. There are only more than 2,000 professional distribution personnel in the national post office, and only more than 10,000 mail carriers who also deliver letters and newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, in the post office system, the demand for expanding the number of professional distribution personnel is very common, and this conference also decided to partially increase the number of personnel, which is very necessary. Post office distribution personnel are the backbone of the distribution work. Without enough backbone, it is difficult to carry out the distribution work.

However, with China's size, the existing distribution force is not enough. The post office should attach great importance to uniting and encouraging all urban and rural forces that are conducive to distribution.

In urban distribution work, while developing its own strength, the post office should adopt a policy of uniting and encouraging private distribution industries under its own leadership. After accepting the distribution task last year, post offices nationwide made great efforts, but after some places attached importance to distribution work as one of the main businesses of the post office, they made deviations in the issue of public-private relations. Although this phenomenon stopped developing after June last year, it still failed to adopt a positive policy. So, is the private distribution industry already in an insignificant position in our distribution work? In fact, it is not like that. According to the materials of the Beijing Municipal Post Office alone, it proves that in the city, the private distribution force still accounts for a considerable proportion. The Beijing Municipal Post Office currently distributes 62,000 copies of newspapers, of which 46 percent are directly distributed by the post office, 45 percent are distributed by private newspaper delivery industries, and the rest are distributed by cooperative newspaper boy organizations and individual newspaper boys. It is inappropriate not to pay attention to such a fact, not to actively lead and transform it, in order to strengthen the distribution force. For the budding cooperative distribution organizations, they should be encouraged. For individual distribution forces, they should also be protected.

The People's Post Office must also be able to undertake the rural distribution task in order to meet the needs of the vast rural people. At present, when the post office is unable to universally establish rural post offices and local newspapers urgently need to solve the problem of rural distribution, it should be advocated to organize rural distribution forces by the rural people themselves under the leadership of the post office. The rural people demand that there be newspapers in every village and newspapers every day. The post office should try its best to meet this requirement. In the countryside after the land reform, the rural people are not satisfied with the state of being closed off in the countryside. The rural people have already used various methods to change the closed state of the countryside. Therefore, depending on the number of villages, the density of population in the local countryside, it is possible to encourage the rural people, within an appropriate scope and in a cooperative manner, to hire appropriate correspondents or distributors to deliver newspapers and letters within appropriate areas. This rural correspondent or distributor is also the reserve force and transitional form of rural post offices. The preliminary experience of organizing a rural communication network created by the Shangzhi County Post Office in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, not only facilitates rural distribution, but also reduces the burden on the rural people in maintaining rural communication, which is worth promoting nationwide.

Now, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications distribution work conference has concluded. We hope that post offices at all levels can conscientiously implement the already clarified guidelines and policies. Governments, Party and mass organizations at all levels across the country should earnestly supervise and help the postal service's distribution work, so that the national newspaper and magazine distribution work can be further developed.

### 改进报刊发行工作是重要的政治任务

　　改进报刊发行工作是重要的政治任务
    中央人民政府邮电部召开的报刊发行工作会议，已于二月二十八日闭幕。这次会议，进一步解决了发行工作上存在的方针和政策的问题，确定了一九五一年报刊发行的计划，适当地增强了邮局的发行机构，这将使今后的报刊发行工作有更进一步的发展的可能。一九五○年，中央邮电部邮局系统各机构，在执行“邮发合一”（邮政工作和报刊发行工作相合一）的方针上，是有成绩的。全国报纸和期刊，一九五○年一年的总发行量，有显著的增加，这当然依靠其他报纸发行机构和书店的努力，但是与邮局担任了发行大部分报纸和一部分刊物的事实是分不开的。现在邮局发行的报纸，已由七十三种增加到一百四十种，占全国各种报纸的百分之五十以上；份数已由每期发行近八十万份增加到二百二十万份，占全国报纸发行总数三百四十万份的百分之六十四以上。邮局发行的期刊，由三十多种增加到一百二十二种，份数已达九十多万份。这次会议确定，到一九五一年底邮局发行报纸每期增加一百二十万份，发行期刊增加七十万份，即比一九五○年分别增加百分之五十五和七十七以上。这一计划，在全国公私发行力量共同努力下，是可能完成的。
    但是，必须指出，上述的发行成绩和一九五一年的计划发行量，如果拿我国人口众多、地区广大、人民觉悟程度日高、经济和文化日益恢复和发展的条件相比较，是极不相称的，绝不能认为已经达到“饱和点”。二亿人口的苏联每日发行报纸达三千三百万份以上，其中，真理报每日发行二百五十万份以上。一千二百万人口的捷克的《红色权利》报每日亦发行五十万份。我国现有的发行规模应当说是很小的。当然，发行量之大小，是和国家的经济、交通和文化发达的程度、报刊本身的质量等有最密切的关系，不能完全决定于人口地域等条件。但是，发行工作的好坏，对于发行的成绩有重大影响，却是没有疑问的。
    人民报刊发行工作，在本质上是一个思想传播的工作。人民对于人民报刊的要求，主要是从报刊上了解人民政府、中国共产党对于当前重大问题上的主张、方针、政策，以及各地的主要工作经验并且利用报纸来反映自己的要求，发表自己的意见。因此，看得懂报的人，固然要求看报，看不懂的人也要求听报。人民对于人民报刊不是可有可无的读物，而是不可缺乏的精神食粮。它是领导与群众间绝对不可缺少的相互联系的范围广大的纽带。世界上再没有一种宣传工具能比报刊更大量、更迅速而又正确地影响群众的。因此，发行报刊是严肃的政治任务。而报刊发行工作进行的状况，就是全国人民所关切的一个重要的问题。
    根据这一次邮电部报刊发行会议的材料看来，在一九五○年的工作基础上，发行工作还须要而且可能大加改进。改进的关键，在于两个问题：
    第一，必须坚持“邮发合一”的方针，邮局对于大部分报纸和一部分刊物必须和书店对于书籍和另一部分刊物一样地负责做好发行工作。一九五○年发行量的增加和发行面的扩大，已经充分证明了由邮局来领导报刊发行工作这个方针的正确性。在中国，还有什么私营发行机构可以和邮局相比呢？首先，全国邮局现有五万多处局所，邮路计达九十二万五千余公里，它的分支机构分布全国，现有员工约五万人，它有着全国统一的领导，和国家其他交通机关有密切的配合，邮局本身也拥有许多交通工具，这是中国今天最大的报纸发行机构。不仅如此，邮局是社会主义性质的企业，它是以服务于国家和人民为目的。它并且应当而且正在用企业化的经营方法，以求逐渐减低发行成本，以减轻读者的负担。而且，在邮局领导之下，一切私营的、带合作性质的和个体的发行力量，都可以团结起来，共同为发行工作服务。这是中国历史上空前的未有的报纸发行阵容，不是任何私营发行力量所能比拟的。所以，不管现行的“邮发合一”的办法中，还有若干需要斟酌修改之处，作为发行方针来说，全国报纸应该坚定地执行“邮发合一”的正确的方针，并且对邮局的发行工作采取积极帮助的态度。期刊的发行，也应该有重点地逐步扩大实行交由邮局办理的办法。
    另一方面，各级邮局必须认真重视发行工作。所有邮政工作人员中，应普遍进行重视发行工作的教育。在过去一年中，全国邮局工作人员对于发行工作的认识是不平衡的。就领导方面来说，一般地提出了正确的“邮发合一”的方针，而对于下级的实际工作的帮助却不够。就各个地区来说，有些地区的发行工作作得很有成绩，有些地区却没有什么进步。甚至部分的邮政工作人员中，错误地看待发行报刊工作，认为是“拣了一根瘦骨头”，认为是“赔钱”的业务，因而对报刊发行工作采取敷衍了事的态度，对于发行部门不加以关心，实际困难不予解决，发行效果也不加以检查。这种看法，是不认识发行工作的重要性，不了解人民邮政光荣的地位和它应当担负的光荣任务，而是一种错误的“单纯的经济观点”。不仅如此，邮局负责报刊发行之后，邮局本身的工作内容，已逐渐发生了变化，报刊发行在整个邮局工作的业务量中，迅速居于重要的地位。一九五○年底统计，全国邮局递送函件共六亿余份，而发行报刊，如以十二月份为基数计算，则全年可达七亿余份，这种新的业务趋势，必须和新的任务一样，为全体邮政工作人员所认识。
    改进发行工作的第二个问题，是必须放手壮大发行力量。从一九五○年邮局工作人员的情况看来，全国发行力量，十分不足。全国邮局专业发行人员，不过二千余人，全国函件与报刊兼用的投递员不过一万人。因此，在邮局系统中，对于扩大专业发行人员的要求，是很普遍的，这次会议也决定了部分地增加人员的数目，这是很必要的。邮局发行人员是发行工作的骨干，没有足够的骨干，发行工作是很难展开的。
    但是，以中国之大，现有的发行力量是不够的，邮局应当十分重视，团结和鼓励城乡一切有利于发行的力量。
    在城市发行工作中，邮局在发展自己的力量的同时，对于私营发行业，应在自己领导之下，采取团结和鼓励的方针。去年全国邮局在接受发行任务之后，曾作了很大的努力，但若干地方在重视了发行工作是邮政主要业务之一之后，却在公私关系问题上发生了偏向。这种现象，虽然在去年六月以后，停止发展，但仍未能采取积极的方针。那么，是不是私营发行业，已经在我们发行工作中处于不足轻重的地位呢？事实上不是这样的。仅据北京市邮局的材料，证明在城市中，私营发行力量，还占着相当大的比重。北京市邮局现在共发行报纸六万二千份，其中邮局直接发行者百分之四十六，经过私营派报业发行者百分之四十五，其余为带合作社性质的报童组织和单个的报童所发行。对于这样一个事实，不加以重视，不积极加以领导和改造，以壮大发行力量，是不适当的。对于已经萌芽的带合作性质的发行组织，应加以鼓励。对于个体的发行力量，亦应加以保护。
    人民邮政还必须能担负起农村发行任务，才能满足农村广大人民的需要。在目前邮局尚无力普遍建立乡村邮政，而地方报纸又迫切需要解决农村发行的情况下，应提倡在邮局领导之下的、由农村人民自己组织起来的乡村发行力量。农村人民要求村村有报，日日有报，邮局应该尽量设法满足这一要求。在土地改革后的农村，农村人民是不满足于乡村中的闭塞状态的。农村人民已经用了多种方法来改变农村的闭塞状态。因此，根据当地乡村的多寡，人口的密度，在适当范围内，鼓励农村人民，用合作方式，雇佣适当的通讯员或发行员在适当的地段内递送报纸和信件，是可以作到的。这种农村通讯员或发行员，也是乡村邮政的后备力量和过渡形式。东北松江省尚志县邮局已创造的组织农村通讯网的初步经验，既便利了农村发行，又减少了农村人民原来在维持农村通讯上的负担，值得在全国提倡。
    现在，邮电部发行工作会议已经闭幕，我们希望各级邮局能根据已经明确的方针和政策切实贯彻执行，全国各级政府、党与群众组织均应当认真督促和帮助邮政的发行工作，以使全国的报刊发行工作得到进一步的发展。
