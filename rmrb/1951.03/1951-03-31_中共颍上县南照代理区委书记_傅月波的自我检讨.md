Party Life

To the Yingshang County Committee of the CPC and forwarded to the People's Daily Editorial Department:

The exposure in the newspaper of the embezzlement of relief supplies by cadres in our district and the criticism of my suppression of criticism are correct. This makes me deeply feel that if it were not for the timely exposure and criticism by the Party newspaper, and the serious handling of this issue by the prefectural and county committees, we, especially myself, would probably make even bigger mistakes in the future.

After the severe floods last year, all parts of the country were enthusiastically donating materials to relieve the victims. Some workers and primary school students were willing to endure the cold themselves and took off their own cotton clothes to donate to the disaster victims. Yet we actually replaced these items. This is an act of corruption and selfish individualism. However, at the time, my understanding of this point was vague, just as the People's Daily short commentary pointed out: "Instead, we defended this kind of vile and shameful behavior."

After the incident, the district committee and I did not recognize this mistake. It was not until the Anhui North Daily criticized it on January 11th, and the county sent a phone call urging us to deal with it and asked whether Zhang Liangfu could be given a dismissal punishment, that the district committee and I initially realized the seriousness of the problem. We then convened a meeting of district committee cadres to conduct a review and handle the matter, and returned all the embezzled items. However, because I did not study the Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications very well, and my understanding was insufficient, coupled with the fact that the writer Gao Jianyi also had some shortcomings, I both reviewed the inappropriateness of replacing relief supplies and criticized the writer at the time. Everyone had some disputes about this matter at the time, so we took out the documents to correct them. After I inquired from the county committee on the phone, I realized that I was completely wrong. I re-examined myself. We discussed the issue of disciplinary action against Comrade Zhang Liangfu and reported to the county committee. Looking back now, our ideological problems were not resolved at that time.

This time, with the help of comrades sent by the prefectural and county committees, we held district committee meetings, district cadre meetings, and township cadre meetings, studying the short commentary published in the newspaper criticizing this incident, and reviewing it from beginning to end again. Only then did we realize that embezzling relief supplies is an act of losing one's position and not caring about the suffering of disaster victims. In order to overcome the above errors, in addition to handing over all the embezzled or disguisedly embezzled items, we also formulated several disciplines: 1. In the future, we must conscientiously study the various decisions of the Party Central Committee and the instructions of higher authorities, especially the decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers; 2. Do not embezzle relief supplies, do not embezzle fruits; 3. Stand firm, and do a good job in distributing relief supplies; 4. Correctly implement policies, oppose coercion, orders and monopolizing; 5. Oppose harmony at all costs and launch criticism and self-criticism; 6. Abide by discipline and obey the leadership.

Finally, I fully accept the punishment given to me by the organization, and I request that the punishment given to me and the handling of this matter be published in the newspaper to educate everyone at the same time.

### 中共颍上县南照代理区委书记  傅月波的自我检讨

　　中共颍上县南照代理区委书记
    傅月波的自我检讨中共颍上县委员会并转人民日报编辑同志：
    报上揭发我区干部偷换救济物资的贪污行为和批评我压制批评的错误是正确的。这使我深深地感到，如果不是党报及时揭发与批评，不是地委和县委认真处理这一问题，恐怕我们，特别是我个人今后还会犯更大的错误。
    去年大水成灾后，全国各地都在热情捐助物资，救济灾民。有些工人和小学生宁愿自己受点冷，也将自己身上穿的棉衣脱下来捐给灾民。而我们竟偷换这些东西。这是一种贪污行为，是自私自利的个人主义。可是当时我对这一点认识是模糊的，正像人民日报短评中所指示的：“却为此种恶劣可耻行为进行辩护”。
    事情发生后，区委和我并没有认识这一错误，直到一月十一日皖北日报批评后，县里来电话督促处理，并提出是否可以给张良辅同志以撤职处分时，区委和我才初步认识到这个问题的严重性，才召开区委会干部会进行检讨处理，把贪污的东西全部退还。但因我对中央在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定，没有很好学习，认识不够，加以写稿人高建仪也有一些缺点，所以我当时一方面检讨了偷换救济物资不对，一方面也批评了写稿人。当时大家对此事有些争执，遂又拿出文件来对正。我又在电话里向县委询问后，才知道我完全错了。我重新检讨。我们讨论了对张良辅同志的处分问题，并向县委作了报告。现在看来当时并没有解决我们的思想问题。
    这次在地委、县委派来的同志的帮助之下，又开了区委会及区的全体干部会议及乡干部会议，学习了报上所登载的批评这一事件的短论，从头到尾又检讨了一次。这才认识到贪污救济物资是一种失去立场，不关心灾民痛苦的行为。为了克服上述错误，除把所有贪污或变相贪污的东西一律交出外并订了几条纪律：一、今后要认真学习党中央的各项决定及上级的指示，特别是关于在报纸上展开批评与自我批评的决定；二、不贪污救济物资，不贪污果实；三、站稳立场，作好发放救济物资的工作；四、正确执行政策，反对强迫命令包办代替作风；五、反对一团和气，开展批评与自我批评；六、遵守纪律，服从领导。
    最后我完全接受组织上给我的处分，并请将给我的处分及这件事情的处理经过在报上发表，同时教育大家。
                                                  傅月波
