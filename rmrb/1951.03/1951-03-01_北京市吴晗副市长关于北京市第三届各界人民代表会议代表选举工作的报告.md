After the Fourth Session of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference passed the "Measures for the Production of Representatives to the Third Beijing People's Representative Conference," the 11th Session of the Second Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee nominated Wu Han, Qian Duansheng, Xue Zizheng, and 23 others to form an election committee responsible for carrying out the representative election work of this session. The election committee was established on January 26 and all members were divided into seven election groups: political parties, government and military, people's organizations, industry and commerce, trade unions and state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, colleges and universities, and districts, to promote and guide the representative election work of relevant units. Starting from January 27, most of the election units established election committees according to the system and launched election work. As of February 16, excluding government representatives and invited representatives, all 431 representatives elected directly by voters and by representative conferences have been elected.

The total number of representatives in this session is 519. Among them, the 431 representatives elected directly by voters and representative conferences account for approximately 83 percent of the total number of representatives; the 115 employee representatives from state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and representatives from colleges and universities elected directly account for approximately 22 percent of the total number of representatives. This is another step forward in enriching the democratic form and content compared with the methods of producing representatives for the first and second representative conferences. This time, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and colleges and universities participated in direct elections, and this experience proves that they can now implement direct elections. However, it is still difficult for workers in some more dispersed small factories and workshops, as well as people from other walks of life, to be directly elected by all voters. For example, some worker representatives, all farmer representatives, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors were elected by the election representative assembly this time; in addition, regional representatives were elected by the district people's representative conferences. After this election, some of the elected representatives received proposals from voters, and some voters requested the representatives to convey their messages well when they returned after the meeting. This strengthened the masses' supervision of the representatives, enabled the representatives to contact the masses more widely and directly, concentrate the opinions of the masses more quickly, and better implement the resolutions of the representative conference among the people from all walks of life.

This election work proves that proposing candidates through democratic consultation is a very good method. It can fully concentrate the opinions of the masses, make the proposed candidates widely representative, and the key is that the consultation must be full and democratic, because consultation is actually the brewing and preparation process of the election. It is necessary to "come from the masses and go to the masses" and repeatedly consult in many ways in order to truly implement the democratic spirit and achieve a true consensus of everyone's opinions; otherwise, if there is no brewing among the masses when consulting candidates, it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses with the election work: "I don't know where the candidates came from?" For example, the candidates initially proposed by Peking University were not widely discussed, so everyone expressed indifference to the election. Later, the candidates were discussed in groups from the bottom up, and then the opinions were gathered and the list of candidates was proposed again, which was unanimously valued and supported by everyone. For example, the General Office of the Municipal Government and some other agencies did not propose a list of candidates during the preliminary election, resulting in too scattered votes, so that some of the elected candidates received less than one-fifth of the votes, and therefore had to be re-elected. These are all lessons worth remembering. In this election, the consultation work was done better in districts, culture and education, and educational trade unions, as well as some state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and colleges and universities. Because these units had better brewing and consultation in advance, the entire election work was also done better.

Due to lack of experience, the election committee had some shortcomings in the work process:

First, at the beginning, it was emphasized that the work should be completed within a limited time, and the time limit was only one week, and it was around the Spring Festival and winter vacation. The busy work of each election unit and the living habits of the masses were not taken into account. In addition, the persons in charge of some units did not pay enough attention to the election work. They did not carry out the necessary publicity and education, nor did they go through good brewing and consultation. They only wanted to complete the election on schedule. Therefore, some representatives were elected more hastily. For example, the Qinghe Woolen Mill held only a ten-minute meeting before holding the election. Some units were affected by the election work because students were taking exams or because of the Spring Festival. After discovering these situations, the election committee immediately extended the election time according to the actual situation, so that each unit could carry out publicity and education and democratic consultation in a timely manner. For example, after the representatives of trade unions and state-owned industrial and mining enterprises were elected, they conducted a week of propaganda on democratic construction and held forums, where the elected representatives directly solicited opinions from the voters. Xinhua Printing Factory, Tsinghua University, and other units conducted more adequate publicity and consultation before the election, and Peking University and other units also did a better job because they re-arranged the election work for the sake of prudence.

Second, there was no planned and systematic publicity. In addition to an editorial published in the People's Daily, no publicity materials were printed and the publicity in the newspapers was not enough. Therefore, the personnel in charge of election work in each unit generally felt that there was a lack of publicity content. In this way, it is impossible to carry out extensive publicity among the masses. Facts have proved that the election work has been done well in units that have carried out universal and in-depth publicity and education among the masses. For example, when discussing the election work, the People's Printing Factory combined the work achievements of previous People's Representative Conferences at all levels and the Municipal People's Government, and cited many facts that benefited the masses personally, such as road construction, electric lights, and toilet construction in the Baizhifang area where the factory is located. After the publicity, some workers said: "This is a major event, and the election must be more careful." Before the election, Wu Han, director of the election committee of Tsinghua University, made a report to the whole school on the work of the government in the past two years, so that voters knew the specific work achievements of the government, the role of the representative conference, and the specific tasks of the representatives, strengthened the masses' love for the government and their understanding of the representative conference, and voters attached great importance to the election. The election was not done well in units that did not carry out universal and in-depth publicity, and fewer people participated in the election. Secondly, attention must be paid to ensuring that the election time does not conflict with business hours. When the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held elections this time, the attendance rate was only 57% of the total number of employees because it conflicted with production time.

Third, the organizational structure was not sound. Many units did not establish election committees in a timely manner, let alone establish publicity agencies or organize necessary reports. The municipal election committee also lacked inspection and assistance for the election work of each unit, and did not provide timely and specific guidance, so that each unit felt that the higher-level election committee had not explained clearly and had no basis for dealing with problems, which increased the difficulty of the election work.

In general, the significance of this election work is very great, expanding the democratic scope of the election and creating more favorable conditions for the continued progress of the people's democratic life in Beijing. At the same time, we have also gained a lot of valuable experience in the work process, which is a good learning experience. Experience has proved that in future election work, we must carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization, go through full brewing and consultation, and have sufficient preparation time. Being eager to achieve success will damage the work.

This election work has proved that the political awareness of the people of Beijing has generally improved and that they are able to effectively exercise their democratic rights; at the same time, it has also proved that this diverse and mixed election method is a relatively appropriate election method at present, and is an effective method to closely contact the masses and enable the broad masses of people to enjoy democratic rights.

　　北京市吴晗副市长关于北京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表选举工作的报告
    自北京市第二届第四次各界人民代表会议通过《北京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表产生办法》后，由第二届市协商委员会第十一次会议，推定吴晗、钱端升、薛子正等二十三人，组织选举委员会，负责进行本届会议的代表选举工作。选举委员会于一月二十六日成立，并由全体委员分工组成党派、机关部队、人民团体、工商界、工会及公营工矿企业、专科以上学校、区域等七个选举小组，负责推动与指导有关单位的代表选举工作。自一月二十七日开始，各选举单位大部分按系统先后成立了选举委员会，展开选举工作，截至二月十六日，除政府代表及邀请代表外，经由选民直接选举和由代表会选举产生的代表四百三十一名，已全部选出。
    本届代表总数为五百十九名。其中，由选民直接选举和代表会选举产生的四百三十一名代表，约占代表总数的百分之八十三；直接选举产生的公营工矿企业职工代表及专科以上学校代表共一百十五名，约占代表总数的百分之二十二。这比第一、二两届代表会议代表的产生办法在民主形式和内容的充实方面，又向前迈进了一步，这次参加直接选举的，是公营工矿企业和专科以上学校，这次经验证明他们现在即可实行直接选举。但有些较分散的小工厂和作坊的工人及其他各阶层人民，目前还很难由全体选民来直接选举。例如：有一部分工人代表、全部农民代表和工商界代表此次均系由选举代表大会所选出；此外，区域代表则系由区人民代表会议所选出。这次选举之后，有些当选的代表，就接到了选民的提案，有的选民要求代表开会回去要好好传达。这样就加强了群众对代表的监督，并使代表能更广泛地更直接地联系群众，将群众的意见更迅速地集中起来，将代表会议的决议，更好地贯彻到各界人民中间去。
    这次选举工作证明：经过民主协商提出候选人是很好的方式。它能够充分集中群众的意见，使提出的候选人具有广泛的代表性，其关键是协商必须充分和民主，因为协商实际上就是选举的酝酿准备过程，一定要“从群众中来，到群众中去”，反复地多方地协商，才能真正贯彻民主精神，使大家的意见达到真正的一致；反之，如果协商候选人时，没有在群众中进行酝酿，就会引起群众对选举工作的不满：“不知道候选人是从那里来的？”例如北京大学最初提出的候选人，没有经过广泛讨论，所以大家对选举表示冷淡。以后，从新自下而上地分组讨论候选人，然后将意见集中起来，再提出的候选人名单，就获得了大家一致的重视与拥护。又如市府秘书厅等部分机关在初选时，未提出候选人名单，结果使票数太分散，以致有的当选人，得票不及五分之一，因此不得不重选。这都是值得记取的教训。这次选举中的协商工作，作得较好的，有区域、文教和教育工会及部分公营工矿企业和专科以上学校等单位。这些单位因为事前酝酿协商得较好，整个选举工作也都做得较好。
    选举委员会由于缺乏经验，在工作过程中发生了一些缺点：
    第一、开始时，强调了限期完成，而期限又只一个星期，且时当春节与寒假前后，没有照顾到各选举单位工作繁忙的情况和群众的生活习惯，又加有些单位的负责人对选举工作不够重视，既未进行必要的宣传教育，又没有经过很好的酝酿协商，只图按期完成选举，因此，一部分代表选得比较草率。如清河制呢厂，只开了十多分钟的会议，就进行选举。有若干单位或因学生正在考试，或因春节关系，都使选举工作受了影响。选举委员会发觉这些情况之后，当即按实际情况，延长了选举时间，使各单位能及时进行宣传教育和民主协商的工作。如工会及公营工矿企业在代表选出后，又进行了一周的民主建政的宣传，并召开座谈会，由当选代表直接向选民征集意见。新华印刷厂、清华大学等，选举前就进行了较充分的宣传和协商，北大等单位，为慎重起见，且重行布置了选举工作，因而也做得较好。
    第二、没有做有计划的有系统的宣传，除人民日报刊载了一篇社论之外，没有印发宣传材料，在报纸上的宣传做得很不够，因此，各单位负责选举工作的人员，一般感到缺乏宣传内容。这样，就不能在群众中展开广泛宣传。事实证明：凡在群众中进行过普遍而深入宣传教育的单位，选举工作就做得好，如人民印刷厂在讨论选举工作时，结合了历届各界人民代表会议和市人民政府的工作成绩，举出许多群众亲身受益的事实，如在该厂所在地白纸坊一带修路、按电灯、建厕所等实例，经过宣传后，有的工人就说：“这可是大事，选举可得慎重点儿”。清华大学在选举前，由选举委员会吴晗主任向全校作了有关政府两年来的工作报告，使选民知道政府的具体工作成绩、代表会议的作用和代表的具体任务，加强了群众对政府的热爱与对代表会议的认识，选民对选举就非常重视。没有进行普遍而深入宣传的单位，选举也就办得不好，参加选举的人数也较少。其次，选举的时间必须注意不要和业务时间冲突，这次石景山钢铁厂选举时，因为和生产时间相冲突，到会参加选举者只占全厂职工总数百分之五十七。
    第三、组织机构不健全，有好些单位未及时成立选举委员会，更没有建立宣传机构，组织必要的报道。市选举委员会对各单位的选举工作也缺乏检查和帮助，没有及时地具体指导，致使各单位感觉到上级选举委员会交代不清楚，处理问题时无所依据，增加了选举工作的困难。
    总的说来，这次选举工作的意义很大，扩大了选举的民主范围，为北京市人民民主生活的继续前进创造了更有利的条件。同时，在工作的过程中，也取得了不少宝贵的经验，是一次很好的学习。经验证明：今后进行选举工作，必须深入的宣传动员，经过充分的酝酿协商，还应有充分的准备时间，急于求成，反会使工作受到损失。
    在这次选举工作中，证明北京市人民的政治觉悟程度普遍地提高了，是能够有效地行使民主权利的；同时，也证明了这种多样的混合的选举方式，在目前是较妥善的选举办法，是能够密切联系群众，使广大人民享受民主权利的有效办法。
