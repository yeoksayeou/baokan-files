　　Rural Party Organizations' Experiences in Guaranteeing the Completion of Agricultural Production Tasks
　　Ruǎn Bóshēng, Secretary of the CPC Tongxian District Committee

　　The CPC Tongxian District Committee of Hebei Province, convened a joint meeting on February 12th of party branch secretaries or branch committee members from fifteen villages, including An'er Sizhuang (Jixian County), Zhaotun (Xianghe County), and Mopu (Tongxian County), to discuss experiences in guaranteeing the completion of agricultural production tasks.

　　Publicizing policies and current events to raise the level of farmers' awareness is the first key to ensuring the completion of agricultural production tasks. After the land reform, some people were feasting and drinking because they did not understand the Party's policies well, and some were deeply afraid of another land reform. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out widespread and in-depth policy publicity and education work to improve the awareness of farmers and make everyone feel at ease in carrying out production. The CPC Beizheng Village Branch in Fangshan County, in response to the ideological situation of the villagers, widely publicized the Party's policies, which stabilized the farmers' production enthusiasm and began to establish the idea of organizing to develop production. The CPC Beishangying Village Branch in Pinggu County did a good job in publicity, and after issuing land certificates, thirty households wanted to buy land. After the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country began, the village branches used various opportunities and methods to carry out publicity and combined the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country with their own work, mobilizing everyone to work hard to increase production and strengthen national defense construction.

　　After publicizing the policies, the question is how to specifically implement the policies. Zhang He, secretary of the Beishangying Village Branch in Pinggu County, summarized his leadership experience and said: "If the policies and decrees are explained to the masses clearly, the masses will consciously implement them." Huang Deyuan, secretary of the Beizheng Village Branch in Fangshan County, used to have a very serious commandist style of work, but after the Party's education, he also adopted the method of persuasion and education for the farmers. The branch members of other villages also paid attention to mobilizing everyone to consciously complete the tasks assigned by the government through farmers' meetings, or by using broadcasting, or by conducting individual talks. On the other hand, branch secretaries, branch committee members, and general party members all paid attention to going deep into the farmers to listen to their opinions and determine the specific steps to complete the work tasks. The party members of Daolingjian Village in Changping County participated in production teams separately and formulated production plans according to the demands of the farmers. In this way, the masses are more likely to accept it and ensure its realization. The CPC Suyukou Village Branch in Huairou County, because it is good at leading everyone to produce according to the demands of the farmers, the production in this village has developed rapidly. Although this village was severely ravaged by the Chiang bandits in the spring of 1947, who robbed 120 heads of livestock and captured 180 young and middle-aged people; however, thanks to the branch's guarantee, the village's production was restored to pre-war levels in 1950. In 1948, the village had only sixteen head of livestock, but now it has increased to one hundred and twenty-one head. The yield in the fields has also exceeded the pre-war average yield of 120 catties per mu, reaching an average yield of 150 catties per mu.

　　"Organize to develop production" is a policy that the village branches keep firmly in mind. All villages have established labor exchange teams. Several villages initially led the "organization" by having the cadres forcibly form large labor exchange teams, which were neither voluntary nor equal in work value, so they quickly collapsed. Later, the branch called on everyone to adopt the principle of voluntary association and equal value of work, and then it was revived. Suyukou Village in Huairou County first took the lead in implementing strict equal value of labor and freely formed eighteen teams, which have persisted for two years. The labor exchange team in Beizheng Village, Fangshan County, implemented the principle of recording work points at zero and has persisted to this day; and they also learned culture in the team (the labor exchange team has a cultural teacher). At the same time, the labor exchange team also solved the contradiction between cadres' production and work. Many cadres participated in the production of the labor exchange team and also led the production of the labor exchange team. This is a very important thing in rural areas. Secondly, the labor exchange team also needs to be combined with the improvement of agricultural technology and sideline production to be sustained for a long time. Therefore, some branch members pay close attention to learning agricultural technology. Some convened veteran farmers to discuss production experience, and some organized agricultural technology teams to strengthen technical guidance for production. Taipingzhuang Village in Daxing County is all sandy soil, and the party members of this village mobilized the masses to use clay to burn fertilizer to improve the soil. The Mopu Branch in Tongxian County helped the masses learn how to select and soak seeds, which increased the cotton harvest.

　　In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the branches also constantly held branch meetings to check the situation of branch committee members and general party members in ensuring production work. The branches have regular meetings, and the Daolingjian Village Branch in Changping County has a daily meeting to report on work or study. The time is not long, and it is dismissed after the meeting. It has become a system. The implementation of branch resolutions generally takes three methods: first, the party member cadres in the government and mass organizations implement the branch's resolutions through the organizational system; second, the branch implements them through party members in the production team; third, the branch committee members lead the labor exchange team separately and implement the branch resolutions through the labor exchange team. The branches also paid great attention to criticism and self-criticism, and carried out necessary criticism of individual party members who failed to complete their tasks. However, they also paid attention to commendation work and gave commendation and rewards to good party members. In this way, the branch has made rapid progress and completed the tasks assigned by the Party.

　　农村党组织保证完成农业生产任务的经验
    中共通县地委会书记  阮泊生
    中共河北通县地委，曾于二月十二日召开了安儿四庄（蓟县）、赵屯（香河）、么铺（通县）等十五个村的党支部书记或支部委员的联席会议，座谈保证完成农业生产任务的经验。
    宣传政策，宣传时事，提高农民觉悟程度，是保证完成农业生产任务的第一个关键。土地改革结束后，有一些群众由于对党的政策了解不够，有些人深恐再来一次土地改革，就大吃大喝。这样就要进行普遍深入的政策宣传教育工作，以提高农民的觉悟程度，使大家安心进行生产。中共房山北郑村支部就针对本村群众思想情况，广泛地宣传了党的政策，农民群众的生产情绪才稳定下来，开始树立起组织起来发展生产的思想。中共平谷北上营村支部宣传工作作的好，发土地证后，就有三十户想买地。抗美援朝保家卫国运动开始后，各村支部又利用各种机会，采取各种方式，进行宣传，并把抗美援朝保家卫国运动与自己的工作结合起来，发动大家努力增加生产，增强国防建设。
    宣传政策之后，就是具体执行政策的问题。平谷北上营支部书记张合同志总结了自己领导经验说：“把政策法令向群众交代清楚了，群众就会自觉的起来执行。”房山北郑村支部书记黄得元过去工作中的强迫命令作风是很严重的，经过党教育之后，也对农民群众，采用了说服教育的办法。其他村的支部党员，也都注意通过农民会议进行动员，或利用广播，或进行个别谈话，动员大家自觉地完成政府所给予的任务。另一方面，支部书记、支部委员及一般党员，都注意深入农民群众中去听取群众的意见，确定完成工作任务的具体步骤。昌平悼陵监村党员分头参加生产小组，根据农民群众要求定出了生产计划。这样群众就容易接受，并能保证实现。中共怀柔苏峪口村支部党员，因为善于根据农民群众要求领导大家生产，所以，这村的生产发展得很快。虽然这村在一九四七年春天曾被蒋匪抢去牲口一百二十头，抓去青壮年一百八十名，受到了敌人严重的摧残；但是由于支部的保证，使全村生产于一九五○年便已恢复到战前水平。一九四八年全村仅有十六头牲口，现在已增加到一百二十一头。地里的产量也已超过战前每亩平均产量一百二十斤的水平，达到每亩一百五十斤的平均产量。
    “组织起来，发展生产”，这是各村支部牢牢记着的一个方针。各村都建立了拨工组。有好几个村对“组织起来”的领导，开始都是先由干部强编成大拨工组，既不自愿，也不齐工等价，因此很快垮台了。以后支部号召大家采取自愿结合，等价齐工的方针，才又搞起来了。怀柔苏峪口村先由党员带头实行了严格的齐工等价，自由结合成十八个组，现已坚持了二年。房山北郑村拨工组实行了齐工零记的方针，一直坚持到现在；而且在组内还学习了文化（拨工组设文化教员）。同时拨工组中又解决了干部生产与工作的矛盾问题，许多干部参加拨工组生产，同时又领导拨工组生产。这在农村说来是一件很重要的事情。其次拨工组还需与改进农业技术结合，和副业生产结合，才能长期坚持下去。因此有些支部的党员很注意学习农业技术。有的召集老农座谈生产经验，有的组织了农业技术小组，以加强对生产的技术指导。大兴县太平庄全是沙土地，这村的党员就发动群众用粘土烧肥，改良土壤。通县么铺支部帮助群众学会了选种浸种，增加了棉花的收获量。
    各支部为了保证上述任务的完成，还不断地召开支部会议来检查支部委员与一般党员保证生产工作的情形。支部有定期的会议，昌平悼陵监村支部每天都有碰头会，汇报工作情况或进行学习，时间不长，开完就散，已形成一种制度。支部决议的贯彻，大体采取了三种方法：第一是通过政权及群众团体中的党员干部，把支部的决议按组织系统贯彻下去；第二是支部通过生产小组中的党员贯彻实现；第三是支委分头领导拨工组，通过拨工组实现支部决议。各支部还很注意批评与自我批评工作，对于个别完不成任务的党员，进行了必要的批评。但是也注意表扬工作，对好的党员予以表扬与奖励。这样，支部进步得很快，完成了党所交给的任务。
