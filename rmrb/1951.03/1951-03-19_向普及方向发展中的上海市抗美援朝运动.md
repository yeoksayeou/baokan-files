　　The Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement Developing Towards Popularization
    Starting to Penetrate Neighborhoods
    The Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement is now starting to penetrate into neighborhoods, developing towards the unorganized masses. More than 1,200 residents from 13 lanes including Meifang Lane and Yinghua Lane in Putuo District, 12,000 residents in Zhabei District, and 18,000 residents in Penglai District have held patriotic demonstrations against the United States rearming Japan. Residents in 150 lanes in North Sichuan District have all signed patriotic pacts. A representative meeting against American arming of Japan was held in the neighborhoods within the jurisdiction of eight police stations in Songshan District. Mr. Zhao Qiming, who had not left his house for more than 20 years, and 99-year-old Mrs. Zhang, who was born in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, both made exceptions to participate in the parade, expressing their patriotic will. More than half of the 300,000 women who participated in the "March 8th" parade were unorganized neighborhood housewives.
    Many threads have already connected the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement with neighborhood residents. The million workers and hundreds of thousands of students in Shanghai who have basically been involved in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement (their families constitute the majority of Shanghai's neighborhood residents), their patriotic actions are educating more than a million residents. The 123,000 industrialists and merchants, more than 3,000 university professors, more than 4,000 people from relief and welfare organizations, more than 1,300 medical workers who signed up to join the medical team at the Korean front, and more than 70,000 patriotic Christians who signed the Christian Reform Manifesto, their tens of thousands of family members have also been more or less influenced by patriotic education. And the thousands of propaganda teams from factories, schools, and professional art troupes who went to the neighborhoods to promote, have more directly and widely educated tens of thousands of residents. On October 17th last year alone, more than 600 propaganda teams composed of more than 10,000 elementary school teachers in Shanghai went to the streets to promote, directly contacting and educating 400,000 citizens. Teachers from central elementary schools in the twelve districts are teaching children to make and collect tools for killing paper tigers, and are holding exhibitions in the schools, inviting parents to visit. This is a further way to use these clues to expand influence and lead the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement to neighborhood residents.
    To carry out the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement in the neighborhoods, it is necessary to combine it with the actual work in the neighborhoods, uniformly use the original organizational forces in the neighborhoods, and fully cultivate and use the active elements in the neighborhoods. Zhabei District combined the establishment of winter defense organizations to carry out the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement in the neighborhoods. The district government first conducted Anti-American and Aid-Korea education among organized residents in the neighborhood tap water management committee, protection team, cleaning branch, military family group, women's federation, household registration service personnel, and unemployed and out-of-school youth study classes. Afterwards, they went to the residents to promote: "If a neighbor's house catches fire and you don't go to save it, the fire will burn to your own house; it's like if Korea is invaded by the American devils and China doesn't help, the American devils will invade China." These promotions combined the residents' immediate interests and vividly linked the current situation with winter defense work. As a result, the Lao Zha District Winter Defense Service Team has a total of 1,993 members, who have become the backbone for further carrying out the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement in the neighborhoods. The Tianzhu Bridge Winter Defense Brigade in Putuo District conducted 67 street promotions in 11 days, educating more than 14,000 neighborhood residents.
    To conduct political propaganda to neighborhood residents, it is necessary to link it with the characteristics of the area and the residents' living conditions, so that the propaganda content is popular and specific. The special agent Luo Bingqian had been lurking at 56 Guangfu West Road, providing intelligence for the US-Chiang bandit planes to bomb. The winter defense team members in Putuo District went to the area to promote the crimes of the bandit Luo as published in the Public Security Pictorial. After hearing the explanation, the nearby residents were very resentful and expressed that they would strengthen anti-espionage and carry out the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement. Putuo District promoted storytellers, Chinese medicine practitioners, and comic book stall owners in the neighborhoods to come out to promote. They are familiar with the local residents' lives and are good at using real people and events to promote, which has achieved great results.
    Accusations also played a big role in neighborhood propaganda. Xin Yuying, the widow of martyr Wang Xiaohe in Penglai District, accused everyone in the neighborhood activist current affairs study class of the crimes of the American bandits and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries who killed her husband alive. Yan Jingtang, who lives at 261 Xuejiabang Road, told at the meeting the tragic scene of the Japanese devils burning Penglai District for 35 days during the Anti-Japanese War. Everyone was filled with grief and indignation after hearing this, reversing their original indifferent and numb thinking, and unanimously agreed to launch a movement against American arming of Japan in the neighborhoods. North Sichuan District, Yangshupu District, Songshan District, Penglai District, Yulin District, etc., combined the transmission of the district people's congress to convene small neighborhood symposiums and accusation meetings. Through accusations and the comparison of life before and after liberation, the residents' understanding has been improved, and they immediately turned to practical action. Residents of Taicheng Lane, Pingliang Road, Yulin District, who were not very concerned about current affairs in the past, held a symposium and conveyed the resolutions of the district representative meeting. After that, everyone understood the conspiracy of the United States to arm Japan, and knew that the opinions they had put forward to the government in the past had been realized. For example, the Longjiang Road area was very deserted at night, and someone suggested adding posts, and the district public security bureau did so. Others suggested that the accumulated coffins on Tangshan Road hindered hygiene and should be removed. Before the district representative meeting was over, the district government transported the accumulated coffins to the suburbs for cremation. These facts deeply touched the residents who attended the meeting. They said: With such a good government, how can we not love our country! ? They all expressed that in the future, they would not only hold more meetings to talk about the current situation and clear their minds, but also take practical actions. Many neighborhoods have signed patriotic covenants, guaranteeing to do a good job in winter defense (fire prevention, anti-special agents, anti-bandits), report special agents, and guarantee not to listen to rumors, not to listen to "Voice of America," and not to buy American goods.
  Combining the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement with the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
    The Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement in Shanghai is currently closely combined with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The anti-special agent movement widely carried out in factories, schools, shops, and neighborhoods has become one of the specific contents of the Shanghai people's Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement at the current stage. They all realize that it is precisely American imperialism that uses special agents to sabotage construction; to oppose American arming of Japan, we must also oppose the illegal activities of special agents kept by American imperialism. In the development of the movement, the two are naturally combined. State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 12 held a workshop accusation meeting, accusing the crimes of American imperialism, Japanese bandits, and special agents at the same time. The accusations of blood and tears contrasted with today's stable life, arousing the workers' unparalleled hatred for the enemy. The workers broke their worries and face, and reported special agents and advised them to fulfill registration. Under the pressure and education of the masses, the reactionary party, league, and special agent elements of the factory began to realize, and more than 30 people have fulfilled registration. At the same time, through accusations and opposition to special agents, the arrogance of special agents was effectively suppressed, the workers' patriotism was greatly improved, and they signed patriotic covenants and carried out patriotic production competitions. Residents of Dening Lane, North Sichuan Road District, accused the crimes of "Cai Huzi" (Cai Yaoxin, traitor, military commander special agent). Cai Yaoxin, who was present, tried to quibble. Sun Hongyuan, who had suffered from him, jumped up and said: "Your crimes, we all know. In order to protect our life of peaceful and happy labor, we must not let the American devils arm Japan again, but also eliminate the special agents lurking in our neighborhoods!"
    This kind of propaganda and education that closely combines opposing special agents and opposing arming Japan, through specific people and events, gives the masses' abstract concept of opposing American arming of Japan, a bloody and fleshy content, and the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement has developed a step forward.
  Anti-American and Aid-Korea Representative Conference
    The Anti-American and Aid-Korea representative conference is a good organizational form to continuously expand and popularize the Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement. Shanghai has successively convened comprehensive municipal, district, and neighborhood Anti-American and Aid-Korea representative conferences, and also convened professional Anti-American and Aid-Korea representative conferences such as church schools. These representative conferences included active elements emerging from the movement and representative figures from all strata and industries, especially absorbing those who had rarely participated in activities in the past but were indeed representative. Therefore, the number of representatives is large, ranging from three, four hundred, six, seven hundred to more than a thousand.
    These representative conferences, on the one hand, have become vivid and concentrated patriotic education classrooms, and on the other hand, they have become command posts guiding the movement forward. At the meeting, the representatives accused the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism, reported work achievements or reviewed work shortcomings, expressed attitudes or determination, and put forward various specific guarantees, which played a role in mutual education and promotion. The representatives of the education sector in Huangpu District were very anxious after listening to the reports of other representatives and said: "It seems that we teachers are doing the worst!" The representatives of the industrial and commercial circles also said: "You have exerted such a huge donation force, and it is still too late for us to catch up!" After the peddlers put forward the two-liang meat donation movement at the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Representative Conference in Penglai District, the industrial and commercial circles immediately decided to launch a donation of 30,000 bullets and 2,000 towels; and proposed a method to ensure no tax arrears: collective guarantee, deposit in the bank daily, pay on time and strengthen the role of tax mutual aid groups. At the Shanghai People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Congress, the workers reported on the achievements of the patriotic production competition, guaranteeing "more output, better quality, lower costs, and fewer accidents," "doing a good job in production and supporting national defense," "if it is necessary to go to the front line, immediately put down the machine and pick up the knives and guns"; peasant representatives guaranteed "listen to Chairman Mao's call, to have food if food is needed, to have money if money is needed, to have people if people are needed"; youth student representatives reported on the situation of participating in military cadre schools, guaranteeing "intensify study, learn well, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and dedicate ourselves to the motherland." Representatives of the industrial and commercial circles guaranteed to learn from the workers and peasants, pay off tax arrears, practice patriotic covenants, and compete with the workers in patriotism. At the meeting, the patriotic enthusiasm of people from all walks of life stimulated and influenced each other.
    These meetings also summarized the achievements and shortcomings of the previous stage of the movement, formulated the struggle program and various action programs and patriotic covenants to guide the movement forward according to the development of the situation and the concentrated requirements of the masses. For example, at the Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Against American Arming Japan Congress, the patriotic covenant of the people of Shanghai was formulated and passed. At the Shanghai Church School Anti-American and Aid-Korea Against American Arming Japan Congress, the patriotic covenant of Shanghai Church Schools was passed, specifically guaranteeing to refuse to accept any form of subsidies from American imperialism, resolutely support and thoroughly implement the decision of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council on handling cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious organizations that accept American subsidies and are operated by foreign countries.
    After pre-meeting deliberations and post-meeting in-depth communication to factories, schools, troops, agencies, neighborhoods, and rural areas, these action struggle programs are closely integrated with the central work of all aspects, and developed into more and more specific patriotic covenants of a factory, a school, and a neighborhood, forming a widespread mass movement.

### 向普及方向发展中的上海市抗美援朝运动

　　向普及方向发展中的上海市抗美援朝运动
    开始深入里弄
    上海市抗美援朝运动现在正开始深入里弄，向无组织群众方面发展。普陀区梅芳里、英华里等十三条里弄的一千二百多居民、闸北区一万二千居民、蓬莱区一万八千居民都举行了反对美国重新武装日本的爱国示威游行。北四川区一百五十条里弄的居民，都订立了爱国公约。嵩山区八个派出所辖区内举行了里弄的反对美国武装日本代表会议。一位二十多年不下楼的赵启明先生、生在太平天国年代的九十九岁的张老太太，都破例参加游行，表现了自己的爱国意志。参加“三八”游行的三十万妇女，其中一半以上是无组织的里弄家庭妇女。
    有许多线索已经将抗美援朝运动和里弄居民贯穿了起来。基本上卷入了抗美援朝运动的上海百万工人、数十万学生（他们的家属构成上海里弄居民的大部分），他们的爱国行动教育着百万以上的居民。参加过爱国游行的十二万三千工商业者、三千余大学教授、四千余救济福利团体人士、一千三百余报名参加朝鲜前线医疗队的医务工作者以及签名在基督教革新宣言上的七万余爱国基督教徒，他们的数以万计的家属，也或多或少受到爱国主义教育的影响。而出动到里弄宣传的工厂、学校、专业文艺团体的千百个宣传队，更直接、广泛地教育了成千成万的居民。仅去年十月十七日那一天，上海一万多小学教师组成的六百多宣传队出动到街头宣传，就直接接触和教育了四十万市民。十二区中心小学的教师们，教导儿童竞做和收集杀纸老虎的工具，并在校内展览着邀请家长到校参观。这是进一步运用这些线索扩大影响，将抗美援朝运动引向里弄居民中去的做法。
    在里弄中正面展开抗美援朝运动，需要结合里弄实际工作，统一使用里弄中原有的组织力量充分培养、使用里弄中的积极分子。闸北区结合建立冬防组织，开展了里弄的抗美援朝运动。区政府首先在里弄自来水管理委员会、防护队、清洁支会、军属小组、家庭妇联、户籍服务员、失业失学青年学习班等有组织居民中进行了抗美援朝教育。以后他们就到居民中宣传：“邻家失火不去救，火就要烧到自己家里来；好像朝鲜被美国赤佬（鬼）侵略，中国不去援助，美国赤佬就要侵到中国来。”这些宣传结合了居民的切身利益，又很生动地将目前形势和冬防工作联系起来。结果老闸区冬防服务队共有队员一千九百九十三人，他们又成为里弄进一步开展抗美援朝运动的骨干。普陀区天助桥冬防大队在十一天中进行六十七次街头宣传，教育了一万四千余里弄居民。
    向里弄居民进行政治宣传，必须联系地区特点和居民生活情况，使宣传内容通俗具体。特务罗炳乾曾潜伏在光复西路五十六号供给美蒋匪机轰炸情报，普陀区冬防队员到该区就宣传登载在公安画报上的罗匪的罪行。附近居民听到讲解后都非常痛恨，纷纷表示要加强反特、开展抗美援朝运动。普陀区推动里弄中的说书先生、中医、摆小人书摊的出来宣传。他们熟悉当地居民生活，善于利用真人真事进行宣传，收到很大效果。
    控诉，在里弄宣传中也发挥很大作用。蓬莱区王孝和烈士夫人忻玉英在里弄积极分子时事学习班上向大家控诉了美国强盗和蒋介石反动派活活杀死她丈夫的罪行。住在薛家浜路二六一号的严景堂在会上讲述了在抗日战争时期日寇火烧蓬莱区三十五天的惨酷情景。大家听了悲愤交加，扭转了原来的不关心的麻痹思想，一致认为要在里弄中展开抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的运动。北四川区、杨树浦区、嵩山区、蓬莱区、榆林区等更结合了传达区人民代表会议，召开里弄小型座谈会、控诉会。通过控诉，通过解放前后生活的对比，居民的认识都提高一步，立即转入实际行动。榆林区平凉路泰成里居民过去对时事不十分关心，召开了座谈会，传达了区代表会议决议以后，大家明了了美国武装日本的阴谋，知道了过去对政府提的意见已经实现了。如龙江路一带晚上很冷落，有人曾提议增设岗位，区公安分局照办了。另有人提议塘山路的积柩妨碍卫生，应该清除。没有等到区代表会议结束，区政府便把积柩运往郊外焚化。这些事实，深深感动着到会居民。他们说：有了这样好的政府，怎么不爱我们的国家！？他们都表示今后不仅要多开会谈时局清醒脑筋，还要拿出实际行动来。许多里弄订立了爱国公约，保证搞好冬防（防火、防特、防匪）、检举特务分子，保证不听谣言，不听“美国之音”，不买美国货。
  抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命相结合
    上海市的抗美援朝运动，目前又紧密和镇压反革命相结合。各工厂，学校，商店，里弄广泛开展的反对特务运动，成为上海市人民目前阶段抗美援朝运动的具体内容之一。他们都认识到正是美帝国主义利用特务来破坏建设；要反对美国武装日本，也要反对美帝国主义豢养着的特务的不法活动。在运动的开展中，二者自然地结合起来。国营棉纺织十二厂举行车间控诉会，同时控诉美帝国主义、日寇和特务的罪行。血泪的控诉对比着今天安定的生活，激起工人对敌人无比的仇恨。工人们都打破了顾虑和情面，纷纷检举特务和劝告他们履行登记。在群众的压力和教育下，该厂的反动党、团、特务分子开始觉悟，已有三十余人履行登记。同时经过控诉和反对特务，特务的气焰被有力地打击下去，工人们的爱国主义情绪大为提高，纷纷订出了爱国公约，进行爱国主义生产竞赛。北四川路区德宁里居民群众控诉“蔡胡子”（蔡耀新、汉奸、军统特务）罪行，在场的蔡耀新企图狡辩。吃过他苦头的孙洪源便跳起来说：“你的罪行，我伲都清楚。为了保护我伲安居乐业生活，我伲不能再让美国赤佬武装日本，也要肃清潜伏在我伲里弄的特务！”
    这样反对特务和反对武装日本紧密相结合的宣传教育，通过了具体的人和事，使群众反对美国武装日本的抽象概念，有了血肉的内容，抗美援朝运动向前发展一步。
  抗美援朝代表会议
    抗美援朝代表会议，则是使上海市的抗美援朝运动面不断扩大和普及的良好组织形式。上海市曾先后召开综合性的市、区和里弄的抗美援朝代表会议，也召开过专业的如教会学校抗美援朝代表会议。这些代表会议都包括了运动中涌现出来的积极分子以及各阶层、各行业人民中代表人物，特别吸收了那些过去很少参加活动但确是有代表性的人物。因此代表的人数很多，自三、四百，六、七百至千余人不等。
    这些代表会议，一方面成为生动、集中的爱国主义教育课堂，一方面又成为指导运动向前发展的司令台。会议上代表们控诉美、日帝国主义罪行，报告工作成果或检讨工作缺点，表示态度或决心，以及提出各项具体保证，都起了互相教育和推动的作用。黄埔区教育界代表在会上听了其他代表的报告，很着急说：“这样看来，还是我们教师做得顶差了！”工商界代表也说：“你们已发挥了这样巨大的捐献力量，我们迎头赶上还来得及！”蓬莱区各界抗美援朝代表会上摊贩提出二两肉捐献运动后，工商界当场决定发动捐献子弹三万发、毛巾二千条；并提出保证不欠税的办法：集体保缴，逐日存银行，按期交清和加强税收互助小组作用。上海市各界人民抗美援朝代表大会上，工人们报告爱国主义生产竞赛成绩，保证“产量要多，质量要好，成本要低，事故要少”，“搞好生产、支援国防”，“需要上前线的话，立即放下机器，扛起刀枪”；农民代表保证“听毛主席召唤，要粮有粮、要钱有钱、要人有人”；青年学生代表报告参加军事干部学校情况，保证“加紧学习，学好功课，随时响应祖国号召，献身祖国”。工商界代表保证向工农看齐，缴清欠税，实践爱国公约，要与工人做爱国比赛。会上各阶层人民的爱国热情互相激荡，互相影响。
    这些会议又都总结了前一阶段运动的成就和缺点，根据形势的发展和集中了群众的要求，制订了指导运动向前发展的斗争纲领和各项行动纲领、爱国公约。如在上海市抗美援朝反对美国武装日本代表大会上，制订和通过了上海全市人民的爱国公约。上海市教会学校反对美国武装日本代表大会上，则通过上海教会学校的爱国公约，特别具体地保证要拒绝接受美帝国主义任何形式的津贴，坚决拥护与彻底执行中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴及外国经营的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。
    经过会前的酝酿和会后深入工厂、学校、部队、机关、里弄、农村的传达，这些行动斗争纲领就密切和各方面的中心工作结合起来，并发展为更多、更具体的一个工厂，一个学校，一个里弄的爱国公约，形成了广泛的群众运动。
