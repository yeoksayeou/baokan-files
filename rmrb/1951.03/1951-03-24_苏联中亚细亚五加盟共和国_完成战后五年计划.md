Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd: The five Soviet Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan have victoriously completed their post-war Five-Year Plans.

　　In 1950, Uzbekistan's coal production was nine times that of 1946, refined metal thirty times, and electricity 1.8 times. In the last three years, industrial production increased by 45 percent, an increase of 83 percent compared to 1940. Uzbekistan's original 6,400 collective farms have been merged into 3,195 large collective farms. The scale of water conservancy projects constructed after the war is equivalent to forty times that of the sixty years before the revolution. Tractor horsepower has increased by 30 percent in the last three years. The income of collective farms in 1950 doubled compared to 1949. Almost all cotton-growing collective farms have become "million-ruble collective farms" (referring to farms with incomes exceeding one million rubles). Uzbekistan now has 5,000 primary and secondary schools with 1.3 million students; 92 secondary technical schools, and 36 universities, with a total of 68,000 students.

　　Kyrgyzstan's industrial output in 1950 doubled compared to 1940, and electricity production increased 164 times in 25 years. The republic's original 559 collective farms have been merged into 230 large collective farms. More than two-thirds of land cultivation work has been mechanized, and the number of improved breeds of horses, fine-wool sheep, and pigs has increased more than fifteen times in the last fifteen years. The number of "million-ruble collective farms" has increased eight times compared to before World War II. Kyrgyzstan, with a population of 1.5 million, now has 1,650 schools with 330,000 students.

　　In 1950, most industrial enterprises in Tajikistan exceeded the production quotas of the Five-Year Plan. The post-war Five-Year Plan for cotton production was completed ahead of schedule in 1948. Livestock, fruit, and grape production all exceeded the levels of the Five-Year Plan. The number of "million-ruble collective farms" has increased by 177 in the last two years. Tajikistan now has 3,000 schools with 300,000 students, and 500 new primary and secondary school buildings have been built in the last three years.

　　Turkmenistan's total industrial output in 1950 increased by more than double compared to 1945, and industrial output had already greatly exceeded pre-war levels far back in 1949. The oil industry completed the Five-Year Plan task ahead of schedule in the three years after the war. Now 70 percent of collective farms have become "million-ruble collective farms." Collective farms in the area of the Turkmen Main Canal own approximately 600,000 goats and sheep, 70,000 head of beef and dairy cattle, and 19,000 camels. Illiteracy has been completely eliminated in Turkmenistan, and seven-year universal education is being implemented.

　　Kazakhstan has victoriously completed the 1950 production plan. As early as 1949, total industrial output had more than doubled compared to before the war, and power generation capacity reached the 1950 level, equivalent to 300 times that of 1913. In 1950, Kazakh collective farmers delivered more than 45 million poods of grain to the state than in 1940, and the original 4,500 collective farms have been merged into 1,670 large collective farms. Rice, sorghum, sugar beet, and tobacco harvests all maintain world records. The Five-Year Plan for livestock breeding was completed ahead of schedule in 1949. The number of "million-ruble collective farms" has increased five times compared to 1940.

    乌兹贝克共和国一九五○年煤产量为一九四六年的九倍、辗金属三十倍、电力一点八倍。在最近三年间，工业生产量增加了百分之四十五，比一九四○年增加了百分之八十三。乌兹贝克原有的六千四百个集体农场已合并为三千一百九十五个大集体农场。战后水利工程的建设规模相当于革命前六十年的四十倍。最近三年间拖拉机马力增加了百分之三十。一九五○年集体农场的收入比一九四九年增加了一倍。几乎所有植棉的集体农场都已成为“百万集体农场”（按指收入在百万卢布以上的农场）。乌兹贝克现有中小学校五千所，学生一百三十万人；中等技术学校九十二所，高等学校三十六所，共有学生六万八千人。
    吉尔吉斯共和国一九五○年工业产量比一九四○年增加了一倍，电力生产在二十五年中增长了一百六十四倍。共和国原有的五百五十九个集体农场已合并成为二百三十个大集体农场。土地耕耘工作已有三分之二以上机械化了，优良品种的马匹、细毛绵羊和猪在最近十五年间增加了十五倍以上。“百万集体农场”的数目已比第二次大战前增加了八倍。人口一百五十万的吉尔吉斯共和国现有学校一千六百五十所，学生三十三万人。
    塔吉克共和国各工业企业一九五○年大部分超过了五年计划的生产定额。战后棉产的五年计划已提前于一九四八年完成。牲畜业、水果、葡萄的生产都超过了五年计划的水平。“百万集体农场”在最近两年间增加了一百七十七个。塔吉克现有学校三千所，学生三十万人，最近三年间新建了五百座中、小学校舍。
    土库曼共和国一九五○年的工业总产量较一九四五年增加一倍以上，远在一九四九年工业产量就已大大超过了战前水平。石油工业在战后三年中已提前完成了五年计划的任务。现在已有百分之七十的集体农场成为“百万集体农场”。土库曼大运河区内的各集体农场，约拥有六十万头山羊和绵羊，七万头食用牛和乳牛，一万九千匹骆驼。土库曼的文盲已完全消灭，七年制普遍教育正在实施。
    哈萨克共和国已胜利完成一九五○年的生产计划。早在一九四九年工业总产量便已超过战前一倍，发电能力达到了一九五○年的水平，相当于一九一三年的三百倍。哈萨克集体农民一九五○年向国家缴纳的谷物超过一九四○年四千五百万普特，原有的四千五百个集体农场已合并为一千六百七十个大集体农场。稻、高粱、甜菜和烟草的收成都保持着世界纪录。繁殖牲畜的五年计划已于一九四九年提前完成。“百万集体农场”的数目比一九四○年增加了五倍。
