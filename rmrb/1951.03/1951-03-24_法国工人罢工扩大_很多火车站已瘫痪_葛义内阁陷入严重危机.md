Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Paris dispatch: The strike of transportation workers in Paris has rapidly expanded to many industries throughout France, particularly in the railway transportation sector.

As of the 21st, 430,000 railway workers in many places, including Paris, Marseille, and Bordeaux, had joined the strike due to demands for increased wages. Railway transportation throughout France has been severely affected. The Gare Saint-Lazare, the largest train station in continental Europe, has been paralyzed. Normally, 1,300 trains carrying 400,000 passengers depart from there daily in all directions. Train stations in Marseille, Lyon, Le Havre, and other places have also been successively closed. Even French President Auriol had to switch to a car when going to Le Havre.

In Paris, all employees of gas plants, power plants, and electric light companies in the city and surrounding suburbs such as Versailles and Gennevilliers have also gone on strike. On the 21st, the pressure of gas in Paris had almost dropped to zero, and power generation had fallen from the normal 600,000 kilowatts to 350,000 kilowatts. 1,500 workers from the Paris water company, workers from the Renault and Peugeot automobile factories in the suburbs of Paris, pottery workers, sanitation workers, and undertakers have also joined the strike. Construction workers and hardware workers have put forward demands for wage increases. Civil servants also demand an immediate wage increase of 4,500 francs and that wages be adjusted at any time in the future according to the price index.

In places like Lyon, Le Mans, and Dijon, gas workers have already gone on strike. All hardware workers in Nantes have gone on strike. Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, and other of France's most important textile centers have also been affected by the strike.

The outbreak of this strike has plunged "Premier Ge Gui's shaky coalition government into a serious crisis" (United Press). Panicked, Ge Gui convened three emergency cabinet meetings in a row on the 19th, 20th, and 21st to discuss countermeasures. Ge Gui also delivered a radio address on the 20th, slandering the strike movement. The Minister of Information, the right-wing Socialist Party member Gazier, also greatly threatened the striking workers. At the same time, the French government dispatched a large number of military police to occupy the factories. However, many workers belonging to the General Confederation of Labor, the Socialist Party's "Workers' Force," the Catholic Labor Confederation, and independent unions have closely formed a united front and are persisting in their struggle.

　　法国工人罢工扩大
    很多火车站已瘫痪
    葛义内阁陷入严重危机
    【新华社二十二日讯】巴黎消息：巴黎交通工人的罢工，已迅速扩大到全法国的许多行业中，特别是扩大到铁路运输事业方面。
    至二十一日为止，巴黎、马赛、波尔多等许多地方的四十三万铁路工人，都因为要求增加工资而参加罢工。法国各地的铁路交通已受到严重影响。欧洲大陆最大的圣·拉萨火车站，已经瘫痪。那里平时每天有一千三百列火车载运四十万旅客驶往各方面去。马赛、里昂、哈佛尔和其他各地的火车站，也接二连三地关闭。甚至法国总统阿里奥尔在去哈佛尔时也不得不改乘汽车。
    在巴黎，市内和近郊凡尔赛、日尼维埃等地的煤气厂、电力厂和电灯公司的全体职工，也举行了罢工。二十一日，巴黎煤气的压力已几乎下降至零度，而发电量也从正常的六十万千瓦降至三十五万千瓦。巴黎自来水公司的一千五百名工人、巴黎近郊雷诺汽车工厂和普吉奥汽车工厂的工人、陶器工人、清道夫和殡仪馆的工人，也已经参加了罢工的行列。建筑工人和五金工人已提出了增加工资的要求。公务员也要求立即答应增加工资四千五百法郎，并要求今后按物价指数随时调整工资。
    在里昂、勒蒙和狄戎等地，煤气工人已经罢工。南特的五金工人已全部罢工。里尔、罗萨斯克和土哥英等法国最重要的纺织业中心也受到罢工的影响。
    这次罢工的爆发，已使“葛义总理风雨飘摇的联合政府陷入严重的危机中”（合众社）。吓慌了的葛义在十九日、二十日和二十一日曾一连召集了三次内阁紧急会议，商讨对策。葛义在二十日还发表广播演说，诬蔑罢工运动。新闻部长、右翼社会党人加齐埃也对罢工工人大肆恫吓。同时，法国政府并出动了大批军警占领工厂。然而，属于总工会、社会党的“工人力量”、天主教劳工联盟和独立工会的许多工人们却紧紧地结成统一阵线，坚持斗争。
