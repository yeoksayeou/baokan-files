About the Story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai
     He Qifang

The story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is one of the most widely circulated Chinese folk legends (I). Its popularity is no accident. It strongly praises the pure love of a young couple, which neither the feudal marriage system nor death can separate. Although Liang Shanbo died regretting his fate, Zhu Yingtai was not carried away by the Ma family. Instead, after her prayer, Liang Shanbo's tomb suddenly split open in a thunderstorm, and she jumped in. Some regional legends also have an epilogue, that Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai later turned into a pair of blue butterflies, or into rainbows in the sky (II). Such endings are naturally romantic. However, this is a kind of positive romanticism. It makes this love tragedy not only conform to the ancient reality but also carries strong hope and optimism. In fact, the entire story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai has a legendary color. Liang Shanbo's character is so simple and pure, that he shared a bed with Zhu Yingtai for three years without knowing she was disguised as a man. Once he discovered her true gender but had no hope of union, he died for love. Zhu Yingtai's character is so witty and bold. She is both good at disguising herself normally and dares to express her love when parting with Liang Shanbo. After Liang Shanbo's death, although her father tried to stop her, she disregarded customs to pay her respects, completely violating the three conditions her father put forward: not to wear mourning clothes, not to cry loudly, and to come and go quickly. All these fictions and exaggerations are not only permissible in literature and art but are also the reasons why this story can be widely circulated.

The significance of the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai lies in this: it reflects the demands of young men and women in feudal society for freedom of marriage, and predicts that this demand will eventually be victorious. Because it is the oral creation of the working people, those anonymous folk creators, on the one hand, certainly have to adapt the characters of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai to their social identities, and the ending of the story to the actual situation at the time. But on the other hand, they will also naturally create this pair of beloved characters and their endings according to the working people's own image and wishes.

Holding such a view, I cannot help but be greatly surprised when I read an article about the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai in the supplement of the Beijing Xinmin Evening News (III). This article was originally a review of the "Lament of Liang Zhu" performed by the Dongshan Yue Opera Troupe, but it first denies many songbooks and local operas:

I have seen or heard of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai in some other local operas and some ditty songbooks. There, Liang Shanbo is a complete fool, not only failing to understand love in life but also knowing nothing about the trivial matters of life. And Zhu Yingtai at this time becomes like a licentious maid, without any shyness, fully revealing her amorous feelings, vulgar and vile. When I watch it, I feel that our folk artists have inevitably ruined these two unjustly dead lovers. What does this show? This shows that the author or performer does not understand or cannot understand the ideological content of this matter, and mostly handles it from the standpoint of the landlord bourgeoisie. What they insist on is still that men always rule, women are always concubines, and if they slightly overstep the prescribed moral norms, they will appear with a face of justice, greatly criticize and condemn, and sing loudly about the decline of social morality. But on the other hand, they are the active destroyers of this norm, gathering women around them and letting them indulge in lust. Erecting chastity arches to carry out the release of sexual desire for women. Pushing women into the abyss, they crazily exaggerate the examples of bad women, and encourage literature and art to express them, in order to achieve the role of moral punishment. At the same time, they also contradictorily support and cultivate the prostitution system. This is unfair. However, rural farmers are playing Zhu Yingtai under the influence of this kind of thinking, which is the result of education in the landlord bourgeoisie.

The "rural farmers" and many songbooks and local operas that express the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai are thus confusedly labeled with the hats of "the standpoint of the landlord bourgeoisie" or their "ideological influence." Then this article criticizes the "Lament of Liang Zhu" performed by the Dongshan Yue Opera Troupe for not giving the original legend "a certain critique," and not "clearing away the ideological faces given to Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai by predecessors." In order to "beautify Zhu Yingtai and Liang Shanbo," this critic says that the characters of these two people should be written like this:

Zhu Yingtai should be a passionate, brave, firm, intelligent, affectionate, and beautiful woman, whose contradictory side may have transcendental thoughts, expressed as uninhibited. At the same time, she lives a noble life, which cultivates her feudal concepts, and she is always a more distressed and contradictory person in her emotions.

Liang Shanbo's character is kind, sincere, hardworking, somewhat restrained, but passionate and sincere. He is certainly not lured by fame and wealth, but is forced to take the old path of scholar-officials seeking fame. The Jin Dynasty's rule is difficult everywhere, and reality stimulates him, which may make him simultaneously maintain thoughts of arrogance and world-weariness, and therefore also have a "pure air," not a "vulgar person," so he can gain Zhu Yingtai's favor. Feudal shackles increase the scholarly flavor, and therefore he is not very shrewd in daily life, with his pure and lovely side. This critic also believes that the "Lament of Liang Zhu" lacks "struggle," "only seeing Zhu Yingtai betraying her faith and not daring to have active struggle, to some extent Zhu Yingtai becomes a weak and unyielding character," and fails to "liberate Zhu Yingtai, who has been distorted by some artists for many years," and "establish a statue of an unyielding free woman." Finally, he says that "the 'Lament of Liang Zhu' adds a superstitious ending in the epilogue," and "from this, thinking about the problem of Liang Shanbo's eyes not closing after death in the mourning, I also feel that it is still an inheritance of old absurd ideas."

I have not seen the performance of the "Lament of Liang Zhu" by the Dongshan Yue Opera Troupe. I have not been able to find the full script of this play, and have only read their printed "Selected Excerpts from the Script." But the issues touched upon by this criticism are not just about the quality of a script, but about the view of the originally circulated story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. The shortcomings of the Dongshan Yue Opera Troupe's script that it accuses mainly lie in the fact that the "critique" of the original legend is not enough, and the changes are not many. As far as I have seen in the "Selected Excerpts from the Script," it is true that it preserves many of the original plots and colors of the folk legend. However, my opinion is the exact opposite of that of the author in the supplement of the Beijing Xinmin Evening News. I think this is precisely a merit. Therefore, I feel that the criticism represents a bad tendency that already exists, which is to treat the literary heritage of the past simply and recklessly, and attempt to destroy the original beautiful parts of those literary works with one's own subjective ideas.

I am not saying that the songbooks and local operas that expressed the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai in the past had no shortcomings. The songbooks that have been printed into books have often been processed by a certain type of author in the city, and compared to the simple and beautiful oral legends of the working people, it is inevitable that some messy and unskilled components will be added (IV). As for adapting it into an old local opera for performance, it is even more likely to add some unnecessary gimmicks, especially in the parts related to the sexes, it is easy to make an exaggerated and low-level performance. However, it must be seen that these shortcomings are secondary. As far as I have seen in the scripts of songbooks and local operas in various places that express this folk story, they generally preserve quite a lot of the colors and imagination of the working people, and have not fundamentally distorted the face and meaning of this legend. Although it is often inevitable that they have shortcomings, even if individual works or individual parts are truly eroded by the thoughts of the landlord class, in any case, it cannot be generalized that many songbooks or local operas that express this legend have deteriorated into things that represent "the standpoint of the landlord bourgeoisie" or their "ideological influence." Liang Shanbo's simplicity and Zhu Yingtai's boldness are neither "fools" nor "licentious," such characters are precisely the result of the working people's "beautification." If Zhang Junrui and Cui Yingying in "Romance of the West Chamber" are typical of the mediocre sons and daughters of the ancient landlord class, and Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are typical of the outstanding and therefore more rebellious sons and daughters of the ancient landlord class, then Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai in folk legends, although according to the circumstances in the story, their identities are also sons and daughters of the landlord class, their characters have exceeded the limitations of the characters of the landlord class, and more or less carry some of the qualities of the working people. Therefore, the ending of Zhang Junrui and Cui Yingying should be "abandoning after the initial chaos," not a hypocritical happy ending; the ending of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu can only be a tragedy, and a tragedy without hope; while the ending of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is different from both of these, achieving a wonderful combination of realism and romanticism. The characters of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai designed by the critic in the supplement of the Beijing Xinmin Evening News are not only messy and contradictory, far less simple and clear than the original, but also things like "may have transcendental thoughts, expressed as uninhibited," and "simultaneously maintain thoughts of arrogance and world-weariness, and therefore also have a 'pure air'," on the contrary, it can be said that they are very much like the "ideological influence" of the landlord class.

The "struggle" required by that critic for the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is probably also "struggle" in his subjective fantasy, which is difficult to allow for in the actual situation of ancient times. In fact, this story originally had struggle. Paying respects, especially the final ending, are highly rebellious expressions. He said that the epilogue "adds a superstitious ending," if it refers to Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai turning into a pair of butterflies after death, that is also wrong. That is not "superstition" but beautiful imagination. The "Selected Excerpts from the Script" of the Dongshan Yue Opera Troupe has a passage about Zhu Yingtai crying that Liang Shanbo's eyes do not close after death, which other songbooks also have. For example, the songbook "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" published by the Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore in the past, also writes more about it:

One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with your parents in the hall? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with the building and the open hall? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with your family property to others? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with the servant boys? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with the good clothes of the four seasons? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with relatives and neighbors? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with books and articles? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with fame and fortune? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with visiting friends at the village gate? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with lacking a person to wear mourning clothes and hold a staff? One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with not having come to see you when you were alive, and coming to your door after your death? Wanting to come to your house to see you, I'm afraid others will speak ill of me. Brother, you understand, men and women should not touch hands. Thinking left and right, I can't guess, I don't know what's in your heart, brother. One eye is closed, one eye is open, could it be that you can't bear to part with your heartless sister? Speaking of what is in Shanbo's heart, he closes both eyes. Yingtai, regardless of shame and ugliness, hugs him and cries sadly: If you can't bear to part, then take me with you, I am willing to see the King of Hell! Despite some shortcomings in the wording of this passage, it is very moving. It expresses the deep love between Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. It creates a sorrowful atmosphere. This is really a very strong poem! However, that critic said that this is "an inheritance of old absurd ideas."

I say that this kind of criticism represents a bad tendency that already exists, because it is not an isolated example, but a fairly universal view. The Hebei Literary and Art Series, edited by the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also has a "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" adapted from old Ping operas and old Yangko operas. The adapter said in the "Preface":

In the old Ping operas and Yangko operas, the theme expressed is destiny, superstition, so Zhu Yingtai has no meaning of resistance in the whole play. And "death" gives people the impression of nothing more than "destiny." This is where the feudal rulers deceived the masses. Because the adapter has such a view, this adaptation almost completely loses the original colors and imagination of the folk legend, becoming a very mediocre script. The final ending, of course, will no longer be the "superstitious" tomb cracking open and Zhu Yingtai walking in, but will be changed to Zhu Yingtai "stabbing her throat with scissors and dying." And Zhu Yingtai's father speaks such words, and then the whole play ends:

It's all my fault for doing things wrong! I forced my daughter to death, now I understand, but it's too late... (Singing) Arranged marriage is the root of the disaster, forcing my own flesh and blood daughter to death. My unjustly dead daughter...

In the newly adapted "Lament of Liang Zhu" jointly issued by the Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore and the Mass Bookstore, the adapter also said in the "Preface" that "Yingtai's sacrifice at the tomb, Shanbo's spirit appearing, and the two turning into butterflies and flying into the sky" is "superstition," so the ending is changed to Zhu Yingtai "crashing her head into the stone tablet" and "dying of anger." Her father also "awakens" because of this, realizing that he is the "executioner," and says:

Throughout the ages, under the constraints of the etiquette of parents' orders and matchmakers' words, I don't know how many children's happiness has been buried! Now I, as a father, have awakened, so let your and Liang Xiangong's spirits accompany each other!

In the old opera reform movement, we have already proposed to pay attention to distinguishing between mythology and superstition. But from these and some other examples, many people are still unable to distinguish. There is a reason for this. The original origins of mythology and superstition are the same, both are due to the fact that human beings are still unable to correctly understand the natural world, so they are very similar in some points. In addition, mythology can also be transformed into superstition. The story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is not a myth but a legend, but after it was widely circulated, there were actually temples of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and the place where Zhu Yingtai was enshrined even became the "Sending Children Hall" (V). To distinguish between mythology and superstition, to distinguish between literary romanticism and superstition, cannot be solved from their appearance, one must carefully understand their internal meaning. Judging from the appearance alone, they are all things that are impossible in fact. But from the perspective of internal meaning, their differences are obvious. Superstition distorts reality, leads people to ignorance, ignorance, and submission to the natural world and the ruling classes of the past; good mythology and positive romanticism, however, express people's precious dreams and wishes in a tortuous or bold way, and often express them through some beautiful images. Liang Shanbo's tomb suddenly splitting open in a thunderstorm, Zhu Yingtai jumping in, her skirt or clothes torn off and turning into a pair of butterflies, or they themselves turning into butterflies, those are solemn images, beautiful images, expressing that their love finally overcame the marriage system at that time, this is by no means superstition. Commentators and adapters of folk literary works must not only be good at distinguishing between mythology and superstition, not only be good at distinguishing between literary romanticism and superstition, but also be good at distinguishing between beautiful images and ugly images. The tomb suddenly cracks open because of people's prayers, and people suddenly turn into butterflies, which is impossible in fact, but they are magnificent images. Stabbing the throat with scissors, or crashing to death on a stone tablet, is possible in fact, but they are clumsy images. Some songbooks and local operas say that after Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai died, the Ma man who wanted to marry Zhu Yingtai sued the King of Hell, and the King of Hell asked the judge to check the books, and it turned out that Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai should be husband and wife, and the Ma man should marry someone else (VI). That does have the color of superstition or "destiny," and we should delete it when we adapt it. However, we cannot conclude that the entire story is promoting superstition or "destiny" because of this tail. The current adapters write a lot about how Zhu Yingtai's father "awakens" in the end, and speaks some new terms, which is also a very unskilled and superfluous tail.

We must never adopt a simple and reckless attitude towards literary heritage. To seriously criticize them, or adapt them, we must have the ideological ability to thoroughly understand the essence of things and a higher literary cultivation, and we must very carefully understand what are truly the merits and what are truly the shortcomings, and we should preserve those merits as much as possible in the adaptation, and not discard the merits as shortcomings. This cannot be done only with a little common sense of natural science, nor can it be done only by relying on a few revolutionary terms or a few simple concepts of social science. We now have some strange theories: saying that folk literature expressing the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai represents "the standpoint of the landlord bourgeoisie" or its "ideological influence"; saying that Du Fu is a "vulgar poet" whose mind is full of "individual heroism" (VII); saying that "since the living standards of capitalist society are more advanced than those of feudal society," therefore the literary technology of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is not good, "each chapter mostly ends with eating," "too monotonous" (VIII); saying that the "108 heroes" on "Water Margin" are mostly bullies, "if they existed today, they would at least be a major obstacle to the development of production," therefore the "heroes" and even the "little minions" of Liangshanbo cannot represent the peasants of that time (IX). All these strange theories are unable to carefully and scientifically analyze the ideological or artistic nature of a specific work, and attempt to rely on a few revolutionary terms or a few simple concepts of social science to arbitrarily "criticize."

During the May Fourth period, China had a movement to re-evaluate literary and cultural heritage. Because the focus of this movement was mainly aimed at feudal ideology, its achievements were mainly reflected in the thorough destruction of old literature and old culture. After this, ideologically poor bourgeois scholars were satisfied with trivial "textual research," and it was impossible to make a scientific and conclusive evaluation of the ideological content and characteristics of many important literary and cultural heritages in our country. Such a task has not yet been completed by left-wing cultural workers. And it can be said that many of them have not treated this huge task with enough serious effort. Therefore, in today's era after the Chinese people's revolution has won a nationwide victory, it is inevitable that there will be another movement to re-evaluate literary and cultural heritage. That is to seriously evaluate it from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. However, if our preparations are insufficient, and we have neither truly mastered Marxism-Leninism, nor have rich cultural knowledge and historical knowledge, coupled with a lack of self-awareness, it is easy to have such a very naive idea that relying on a few revolutionary terms or a few simple concepts of social science can "criticize" everything and can pass unimpeded, and this will inevitably lead to many errors, and will lead to joke-style errors. In fact, as early as sixty years ago, Engels issued a warning. He said that Marxist terms should not be used as "labels" to be randomly affixed. He said, "Generally speaking, the word 'materialistic' is only used as a simple cliche by many younger authors in Germany, who affix it to everything without delving into it, that is, thinking that as long as the label is affixed, the matter is over. In fact, our historical view is mainly a guide for research, not a lever for Hegelian-style construction." He lamented that few people at that time were willing to seriously study history and actual materials, "The cliché of historical materialism (in fact, everything can be turned into a cliché) only has such a use for many younger Germans: to most quickly create a system out of their own relatively poor historical knowledge (the history of economics is still sleeping in the cradle!), in order to make themselves appear very authoritative." How well said these words are! Engels then said a very moving passage. He said, "These gentlemen often think that everything they do is good enough for the workers. If these gentlemen knew how Marx thought that even his best things were not good enough for the workers, how he thought that it was a crime to contribute something that was not perfect to the workers!" (X)

Not only the literary and art circles, but also the entire writing circles, should always remember Engels' words. For us, this may be too high a standard. However, as a Chinese ancient person said, "The Book of Poetry says: 'High mountains are looked up to, great roads are followed.' Although we cannot reach it, our hearts yearn for it." If we set such a standard as the goal of our efforts, it can powerfully spur us and improve us.

(I) Not only popular in the north and south provinces of China, but also spread abroad. Qian Nanyang's "A Narrative on the Story of Zhu Yingtai" in the 93rd, 4th, and 5th combined issues of the "Folklore" Weekly says that someone obtained a Korean version of the Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai print in Korea.

(II) Most of the folk tales and songbooks I have seen say that when Zhu Yingtai walked into Liang Shanbo's tomb, the skirt or clothes torn off were turned into a pair of butterflies. But some also say that the butterflies are the incarnation of the two of them. Turning into rainbows in the sky is seen in Huang Zhaonian's "Snake Boy" compiled in Guangdong. The legend in my hometown of Sichuan also says that they turned into a pair of birds. And there is indeed a kind of bird that is as big as a dove, with deep blue feathers, the male and female are always together, one of which has a red tail that is a foot long, and is called Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai by people.

(III) This article is titled "On the Theme of 'Lament of Liang Zhu'," the author is Gong Chun, and it was published in the "New Drama" supplement of the Beijing Xinmin Evening News on September 18 and 25, 1950.

(IV) The Sichuan "Liu Yin Ji" that I saw in the past added a bizarre long tail, saying that Zhu Yingtai later became queen in some place, and Liang Shanbo went to recruit her, and then they married. The songbook "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" printed by the Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore in the past, although it basically preserves the original plot of the folk story, also adds many tedious descriptions. The songbook "Liang Zhu Marriage" by the Shanghai Jinzhang Bookstore, seems to be based on a single copy. But I don't know what copy they used, and where it was popular. I have also recently seen a story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, which was written in the style of inferior Saturday school novels and had inscriptions by Huang Jingwan, was very vulgar and sensational, and it really completely changed the face of this legend.

(V) See Qian Nanyang's "The Story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" in the 8th issue of the 1st volume of the "Peking University Institute of Sinology Weekly."

(VI) Liu Wanzhang's "Liang Zhu in Haifeng Opera" in the 93rd, 4th, and 5th combined issues of the "Folklore" Weekly says that the Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai story play in Haifeng, Guangdong has such a program called "Yan Wang's Trial." The Huagu lyrics that Sichuan sings about Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai are slightly similar to this in the last paragraph. The King of Hell finally said: "Marriage is predetermined in the previous life, not even half a point different."

(VII) See Wang Xunliu's "A Review of Feng Zhi's 'Du Fu's Family and Background'" in the new 5th issue of "Literary Life."

(VIII) See Ye Huosheng's "On the Technical Level of Chinese Old Literature and the Problem of Accepting Heritage" in the 6th issue of the 1st volume of "Literary News."

(IX) See Wang Chun's "Reading Comrade Wang Yaping's Wu Song Seizing the Hotel" in the "Mass Literature Collection" printed by the Workers' Publishing House.

(X) Engels' words are seen in his letter to Conrad Schmidt on August 5, 1890. The "Collection of Letters of Marx and Engels" and "Methodology of Thought" edited by the Liberation Press include two fragments of this letter. The translation I quoted here has some differences from the text in the above two books, and it has been carefully revised with reference to the original translator's recent revised draft.

### 关于梁山伯祝英台故事

专栏：

　　关于梁山伯祝英台故事
     何其芳
    梁山伯祝英台故事是流行得最广泛的中国民间传说之一（一）。它这样流行并不是偶然的。它十分强烈地歌颂了一对青年男女的纯洁的爱情，无论封建社会的婚姻制度，无论死亡，都不能把他们分开。梁山伯虽然饮恨而死，祝英台却并没有被马家抬去，而是在她的祝告之后，梁山伯的坟墓忽然在大雷雨中裂开，她跳了进去。有些地区的传说还有一个尾声，那就是梁山伯和祝英台后来变成了一双蓝色的蝴蝶，或者变成了天上的彩虹（二）。这样的结局自然都是浪漫主义的。然而这正是一种积极的浪漫主义。它使得这个爱情的悲剧不但符合古代的现实，而且又带着坚强的希望，乐观的精神。其实整个梁山伯祝英台故事都有一种传奇的色彩。梁山伯的性格是那样朴质，单纯，和祝英台同床三年却并不知道她是女扮男装，而一旦发现了她的真正性别但又断绝了结合的希望以后，他就以死殉情。祝英台的性格是那样机智、大胆，她既善于在平时掩盖她的改装，又敢于在和梁山伯分别的时候表达她的爱情。在梁山伯死后，虽然她的父亲极力阻止，她却不顾习俗地去吊孝，并且完全违背了她父亲提出的不穿孝，不大哭，速去速来这样三个条件。所有这些虚构和夸张不但是文学艺术所允许有的，而且也是这个故事能够广泛流传的原因。
    梁山伯祝英台故事的意义就在这里，它反映了封建社会的青年男女的婚姻自由的要求，并且预言了这种要求最后一定会得到胜利。因为它是劳动人民的口头创作，那些无名的民间创作家一方面固然要在某些点上使梁山伯祝英台的性格适应两人的社会身份，故事的结局适应当时的实际情况，但另一方面，他们也自然会按照劳动人民自己的面貌和愿望来创造这一对他们所喜爱的人物及其结局。
    由于抱着这样的看法，我读到北京新民报副刊上的一篇有关梁山伯祝英台故事的文章（三），就不能不感到很大的惊异了。这篇文章本来是评论东山越艺社演出的《梁祝哀史》的，然而它却首先否定了许多唱本和地方戏：
    我从别的一些地方戏里以及一些小调唱本里，看到过或听到过梁山伯与祝英台。在那里，梁山伯是一个十足的傻蛋，不特毫不理解人生里面的爱情，甚至连生活里的小节都一无所知。而祝英台在此时候，也就变成了淫贱的婢女似的，毫无羞涩，风情毕露，下流而恶劣。我看的时候，就感到我们的民间艺人未免糟踏这两位屈死的情侣。这说明了什么呢？这说明作者或演出者对于这个事情的思想内涵不理解或不能理解，而多半是从地主资产阶级的立场来处理它。他们所坚持的还不就是男性永远统治，女人总是贱妾，稍微越出钦定的道德规范，他们就会以正义的面貌出现，大加非责，高唱世风之不古么。但另一方面，他们却是这个规范之积极的破坏者，将女人搜罗在他的周围，听其纵欲。竖立贞节牌坊，以实行对于女人的性欲宣泄。将女人推入沉渊似的，疯狂的夸饰着坏女人的范例，怂恿着文学艺术来表现他，以达到道德的惩戒作用。同时，又矛盾的支持与培养着娼妓制度。这是不公平的。可是，乡野的农民却是从这种思想影响下扮演着祝英台，这是在地主资产阶级的教养里造成的结局。
    《乡野的农民》和许多表现梁山伯祝英台故事的唱本、地方戏，就是这样胡里胡涂地被戴上了“地主资产阶级的立场”或者他们的“思想影响”的帽子。接着这篇文章就批评东山越艺社演出的《梁祝哀史》并没有对原来的传说“给予一定的批判”，并没有“将前人给予梁山伯祝英台的思想面貌加以清刷”。为了“美化祝英台与梁山伯”，这位批评者说，这两个人物的性格应当写成这样：
    祝英台应该是热烈、勇敢、坚定、聪明、多情、美丽的女性，其矛盾的一面可能有超世的思想，表现为放荡不羁。同时，她过着贵族生活，使她的封建观念被给予培养，而在情绪上总是较为苦恼矛盾的人。
    梁山伯的性格是善良、诚恳、勤苦、有些拘谨，然而热烈真挚，固然不是利禄薰心，而是被迫的走着士大夫求功名的老路。晋家天下是四方有难的，现实给他刺激，可能使他同时保有傲物厌世思想，因而也有着一股“清气”，不是“俗子”，所以方获得祝英台的好感。封建束缚增厚了书生风味，因而也就在日常生活上不大精明，有他的纯厚可爱之处。这位批评者又认为《梁祝哀史》里缺乏“斗争”，“只看到祝英台背信弃义，不敢有积极的斗争，在某种程度上祝英台成为柔弱无刚的人物”，没有能够“使多少年月里被一些艺人歪曲了的祝英台获得解放”，“树立一个不屈的自由的女性塑像”。最后，他说“《梁祝哀史》在尾声里添了一个充满迷信的收场”，并且“由此想到，吊孝里面的梁山伯死后不闭眼睛的问题，也觉得还是旧的荒唐观念的因袭”。
    我并没有看过东山越艺社的《梁祝哀史》的演出。这个剧的全部脚本我也一直还没有找到，只读了他们印的《剧词选刊》。但这篇批评所接触到的问题已经不仅仅是一个脚本的好坏，而是对于民间原来流传的梁山伯祝英台故事的看法。它所指责的东山越艺社的脚本的缺点，主要就是对于原来的传说“批判”不够，改动不多。就我所看到的《剧词选刊》说来，的确那是保存了许多民间传说原有的情节和色彩的。然而我的意见却和北京新民报副刊上的那位作者刚刚相反，我认为这正是一个优点。因此，我觉得那篇批评代表了目前已经存在的一种不好倾向，这种倾向就是简单地鲁莽地对待过去的文学遗产，并企图以自己的主观主义的想法来破坏那些文学作品原有的优美地方。
    我这并不是说过去那些表现梁山伯祝英台故事的唱本和地方戏就没有缺点。已经印成书的唱本常常是经过了城市里的某一类作者的加工，比起劳动人民原来的朴素而又美丽的口头传说，难免要加上一些杂乱的不高明的成份（四）。至于改编为旧的地方戏来演出，更可能增添了一些不必要的噱头，特别是有关两性的地方很容易作一种夸张的低级趣味的表演。然而，必须看到这些缺点都是次要的。就我所看到的各地表现这个民间故事的唱本和地方戏脚本说来，它们一般都是保存了相当多的劳动人民的色彩和想像，并没有从根本上歪曲了这个传说的面目和意义。虽说它们常常难免有缺点，甚至即令其中个别作品或个别部分真是受了地主阶级的思想的侵蚀，无论如何也不能笼统地说许多表现这个传说的唱本或地方戏都已经变质为代表“地主资产阶级的立场”或其“思想影响”的东西。梁山伯的质朴，祝英台的大胆，不是“傻蛋”，也不是“淫贱”，这样的性格正是劳动人民“美化”的结果。如果说《西厢记》里面的张君瑞和崔莺莺是古代地主阶级的平庸的儿女的典型，《红楼梦》里面的贾宝玉和林黛玉是古代地主阶级的优秀的因而更带叛逆性的儿女的典型，那么民间传说里面的梁山伯和祝英台，虽说按照故事里讲的情形看来，他们的身份同是地主阶级的儿女，但他们的性格却已经超出了地主阶级的人物的限制，多多少少带有一些劳动人民的本色了。所以张君瑞和崔莺莺的结局应该是“始乱终弃”，而不是虚伪的大团圆；贾宝玉和林黛玉的结局只能是悲剧，而且是看不见希望的悲剧；而梁山伯和祝英台的结局却与这两种都不相同，达到了现实主义和浪漫主义的美妙的结合。像北京新民报副刊上的那位批评者所设计的梁山伯和祝英台的性格，不但是杂乱的矛盾的，远不如原来那样单纯，明确，而且什么“可能有超世的思想，表现为放荡不羁”，什么“同时保有傲物厌世思想，因而也有着一股‘清气’”，倒反而可以说才很像是地主阶级的“思想影响”。
    那位批评者对梁山伯祝英台故事所要求的“斗争”也大概是他主观幻想里面的，为古代的实际情况所难于允许的“斗争”。其实这个故事本来是有斗争的。吊孝，尤其是最后的结局，都是高度的反抗性的表现。他说尾声里面“添了一个充满迷信的收场”，如果是指梁山伯祝英台死后化为一双蝴蝶，那也是错误的。那不是“迷信”而是美丽的想像。祝英台吊孝时哭梁山伯死后眼睛不闭，东山越艺社的《剧词选刊》上有那一段，那是别的唱本也有的。比如上海广益书局过去出的唱本《梁山伯祝英台》，就还要写得多一些：
    一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得堂上二双亲？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得楼房共敞厅？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得家财与别人？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得安童小使们？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得四季好衣裳？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得亲戚邻舍人？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得书籍与文章？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得功名与前程？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得访友到庄门？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得少个披麻执仗人？一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得在日不曾来看你，死后来上你的门？欲要到府来看你，恐怕旁人说短长。哥哥你是明白的，男女授受不相亲。左思右想猜不到，不知哥哥什么心。一只眼儿闭，一只眼儿睁，莫不是舍不得妹妹薄情人？说到山伯心上话，闭了双双两眼睛。英台不顾羞和丑，一把抱住放悲声：难舍就可带我去，甘心愿意见阎君！尽管这一段唱词有些字句上的缺点，它却是十分感动人的。它表现出来了梁山伯和祝英台两人之间的深厚的爱情。它造成了一种悲恸的气氛。这实在是一段很强烈的诗！然而那位批评者却说这是“旧的荒唐观念的因袭”。
    我说这种批评代表了目前已经存在的一种不好倾向，因为它并不是个别的例子，而是相当带普遍性的看法。河北省文学艺术界联合会主编的河北文艺丛书中，也有一本根据旧评剧和旧秧歌剧改编的《梁山伯与祝英台》。改编者在《前言》上说：
    旧评戏和秧歌中，所表现的主题思想是命运的，迷信的，因此祝英台在全剧中没有一点反抗的意义。而“死”给人的印象只不过是“命运”而已。这是封建统治者愚骗群众的地方。由于改编者有这样的看法，这个改编本差不多完全丧失了民间传说原有的色彩和想像，成为一个很平庸的脚本。最后的结局当然也不会再是“迷信”的坟墓裂开，祝英台走了进去，而是改为祝英台“用剪刀刺入喉中而死”。而且祝英台的父亲讲起这样的话来，于是全剧就结束了：
    这都怨我把事做错！逼死了女儿，这会我明白啦，也晚了……（唱）包办婚姻起祸根，逼死女儿骨肉亲。屈死的女儿啊……
    上海广益书局民众书店联合发行的新改编本《梁祝哀史》里面，改编者也在《前言》上说“英台祭坟，山伯显灵，双双化为蝴蝶飞上天去”是“迷信”，所以把结局改为祝英台“向石碑一头撞过去”，“气绝而亡”。她的父亲也是因此就“觉悟”了，认识到自己是“刽子手”，并且说：
    古往今来，在父母之命，媒妁之言的礼教约束之下，不知葬送了多少儿女的幸福！如今为父觉悟了，就使你和梁相公的阴灵相伴一处吧！
    在旧剧改革运动中，我们已经提出来要注意区别神话与迷信。但从这些以及其他一些例子看来，许多人还是不能够区别。这是有原因的。神话与迷信的最初的起源本来是相同的，都是由于人类还不能够正确地理解自然界，所以它们在某些点上很相像。加以神话又可以转变为迷信。梁山伯祝英台故事还并不是神话而是传说，但它广泛流传以后，就居然有了梁山伯祝英台的庙宇，而供祝英台的地方甚至成了《送子殿》（五）。要区别神话与迷信，要区别文学上的浪漫主义与迷信，不是从它们的外表所能解决问题的，必须细心地体会它们的内部意义。仅仅从外表看来，它们都是事实上不可能有的事情。但从内部意义来考察，它们的区别就明显了。迷信是歪曲现实的，引导人走向无知，愚昧，并屈服于自然界和过去的统治阶级；好的神话和积极的浪漫主义却是曲折地或者大胆地表现了人的可贵的梦想与愿望，并且常常通过一些美丽的形象来表现。梁山伯的坟墓在大雷雨中忽然裂开，祝英台跳了进去，她被人扯下的裙子变为一双蝴蝶，或者他们本人变为蝴蝶，那正是庄严的形象，美丽的形象，表现了他们的爱情最后战胜了当时的婚姻制度，这绝不是迷信。民间文学作品的评论者和改编者不但要善于区别神话与迷信，不但要善于区别文学上的浪漫主义与迷信，而且要善于区别美好的形象与丑陋的形象。坟墓因了人的祝告而就忽然裂开，人又忽然变为蝴蝶，是事实上不可能的，然而它们是壮丽的形象。剪刀刺入喉中，或者在石碑上撞死，是事实上可能的，然而它们是拙劣的形象。有的唱本和地方戏说梁山伯祝英台死后，想娶祝英台的马姓男子向阎罗王告状，阎罗王叫判官查簿子，原来梁山伯祝英台应该是夫妇，马姓男子应该另娶（六）。那的确带有迷信或“命运”的色彩，我们改编的时候是应该删掉的。不过我们也不能因为这个尾巴就断定整个故事是宣传迷信或“命运”。现在的改编者在最后大写祝英台的父亲如何“觉悟”，并且讲起一些新名词来，那同样是一个很不高明的多余的尾巴。
    我们对待文学遗产，绝不可采取一种简单的鲁莽的态度。要认真去批判它们，或改编它们，我们必须有洞彻事物本质的思想能力和较高的文学修养，必须十分细心地去了解到底哪些真正是优点，哪些又真正是缺点，而在改编中应该尽可能保存那些优点，不可把优点也当作缺点抛弃。这既不是仅仅有了一点自然科学的常识，也不是仅仅依靠几个革命术语或几个简单的社会科学的概念就能够胜任的。我们现在已经有了这样一些怪论：说表现梁山伯祝英台故事的民间文学是代表“地主资产阶级的立场”或其“思想影响”；说杜甫是一个“庸俗诗人”，脑子里充满着“个人英雄主义思想”（七）；说“既然资本主义社会的生活水平比之封建社会更高级”，因之《红楼梦》的文学技术就不行，“每回大都用吃饭作结束”，“太单调”（八）；说《水浒》上的“一百单八位”以恶霸为多，“如果存在于今天，至少也是发展生产的大障碍”，因之梁山泊的“好汉”以至“小喽罗”都不能代表当时的农民（九）。所有这些怪论都是不能够细心地科学地分析一个具体作品的思想性或艺术性，企图依靠几个革命术语或几个简单的社会科学的概念就去妄加“批判”。
    五四时期，中国曾经有过一次对文学遗产和文化遗产重新估价的运动。因为这个运动的锋芒主要是针对着封建主义的意识形态，所以它的成就也主要表现在对于旧文学旧文化的彻底破坏方面。在这以后，思想贫乏的资产阶级学者满足于琐碎的“考据”，不可能对我国许多重要的文学遗产和文化遗产的思想内容及其特点作出科学的定论式的估价。这样的任务，左翼的文化工作者也还没有来得及去完成。而且可以说，其中的许多人还没有用足够认真的努力来对待这个巨大的任务。因此，在中国人民革命取得了全国胜利以后的今天，必然要产生再一次的对文学遗产和文化遗产重新估价的运动。这就是认真地用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法来估价。然而，如果我们的准备不足，既未能真正通晓马克思列宁主义，又没有丰富的文化知识历史知识，再加上缺乏自知之明，就很容易有这样一种十分幼稚的想法，以为依靠几个革命术语或几个简单的社会科学的概念就可以“批判”一切，就可以通行无阻，而这就必然要发生许多错误，并且要发生笑话式的错误。其实早在六十年以前，恩格斯就作过警告了。他说不可把马克思主义的词句当作“标记”来随便贴用。他说，“一般地说，‘唯物论的’这个字，对于德国的许多较年轻的著作者，只被当作一个简单的套语来用，人们不加深究地把它贴在一切东西上，也就是说，以为只要贴上了这个标记，事情就算作完了。其实我们的历史见解主要是研究的向导，而不是黑格尔学派式的构造的杠杆。”他慨叹当时很少人肯认真地去研究历史和实际材料，“历史唯物论的套语（其实一切都可以被人弄成套语）对于许多较年轻的德国人只有这样的用处：最急促地把他们自己的比较贫乏的历史知识（经济的历史甚至还睡在摇篮里！）造成体系，以便使自己显得非常有权威的样子”。这些话是说得多好呵！恩格斯接着还讲了一段非常动人的话。他说，“这些先生常常以为所做的一切对于劳动者已经够好了。如果这些先生知道，马克思是怎样地认为，他最好的东西对于劳动者也还不是够好的，他是怎样地认为，贡献给劳动者的东西不够尽善尽美便是一种犯罪！”（十）
    不仅是文艺界，而且是整个著作界，都应当时常记住恩格斯的这样的话。对于我们，这或许是一个太高的标准。然而，如像中国的一位古人所说的，“诗有之：‘高山仰止，景行行止。’虽不能至，然心向往之。”如果把这样的标准悬为我们努力的目标，它就可以有力地鞭策我们，提高我们。
