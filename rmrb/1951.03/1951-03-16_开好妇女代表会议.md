Short Commentary

　　Holding women's representative conferences is the best organizational form for uniting and organizing all patriotic and democratic women to participate in current work in various fields. As early as 1933, when Chairman Mao discussed the great role of women in the Soviet areas in the land revolution war in the Changgang Township investigation report, he pointed out: "The leadership and promotion of the women workers and peasants representative conferences here is a crucial link." He also instructed: "The women workers and peasants representative conference should first focus on the immediate interests of the women masses, and, following the mobilization on these issues, link it to all political mobilization." The women's organizational work in the liberated areas basically followed this policy; the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its "Decision on Rural Women's Work in the Liberated Areas at Present" on December 20, 1948, that "women's representative conferences are the best organizational form for more extensively and democratically connecting with the women masses." In 1950, the Third Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation also adopted the "Organizational Rules for Women's Representative Conferences." The results of the pilot construction of the women's representative conference system in various regions over the past two years have proved that women's representative conferences are indeed the best organizational form for women's groups to connect with women from all walks of life. However, in the process of pilot construction, some women's work cadres in some regions still have tendencies of closed-doorism and formalism in using this organizational form. They either set the qualifications for representatives too strictly, or demand too much politically; or they adopt the method of "registering, grouping, and electing representatives," which makes many women masses lose the opportunity to participate in the election of representatives; as a result, the role of the women's representative conference is greatly weakened. Cadres in some areas regard convening women's representative conferences only as a way to convey instructions and resolutions from higher authorities, and do not regard it as the main foundation of the democratic women's federation. The Family Women's Representative Conference in the jurisdiction of the First Police Station in Jiangning District, Shanghai, is a better example. It avoids the various problems mentioned above and is established in mass movements, combined with the central work of the local government at that time. Therefore, it can more widely gather the problems and opinions of the women masses and play the role of a bridge between women's groups and the vast number of unorganized housewives. It is hoped that this experience can attract the attention of various regions.

### 开好妇女代表会议

　　开好妇女代表会议
    团结、组织全体爱国民主妇女，参加当前各方面工作的最好的组织形式，是妇女代表会议。远在一九三三年，毛主席在长冈乡调查报告中，当论及苏区妇女在土地革命战争中的伟大作用时，即指出：“这里女工农妇代表会的领导与推动，是紧要的关节。”他又指示：“女工农妇代表会，首先应该抓紧妇女群众的切身利益问题，跟着这些问题的动员，联系到一切政治的动员。”解放区的妇女组织工作，基本上遵循了这一方针；一九四八年十二月二十日中共中央关于目前解放区农村妇女工作决定中曾指出：“妇女代表会议是更广泛地、更民主地联系妇女群众的最好的组织形式”，一九五○年全国民主妇女联合会第三次执委会更通过了“妇女代表会议组织通则”，两年来各地重点试建妇女代表会议制度的结果，证明妇女代表会议确是妇女团体联系各阶层妇女最好的组织形式。但在重点试建过程中，也还有若干地区的妇女工作干部，在运用这一组织形式时存有关门主义及形式主义的偏向。她们或者把代表资格规定过严，政治上要求过高；或者采用“报名，编组，选代表”的办法，使很多妇女群众失去了参加选举代表的机会；其结果都大大削弱了妇女代表会议的作用。有的地区的干部则把召开妇女代表会议仅仅当作传达上级指示、决议的一种工作方法，没有把它当作是民主妇女联合会的主要基础。上海市江宁区第一派出所辖区家庭妇女代表会议是一个较好的例子，它避免了以上所说的各种毛病，而是经过必要的准备，结合了当时当地政府的中心工作，在群众运动中建立的。因此，它能够较广泛地集中妇女群众的问题与意见，发挥了妇女团体与广大无组织的家庭妇女间的桥梁作用。这一经验希望能够引起各地重视。
