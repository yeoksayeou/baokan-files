    Tianjin Uncovers American Spy Organization
    Twenty-One Chinese and Foreign Spy Criminals Arrested
    [This Newspaper Report] The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, after a long period of investigation, recently uncovered a lurking organization of the American imperialist spy agency, the Army Strategic Intelligence Unit (S.S.U.), in Tianjin. Twenty-one Chinese and foreign American spy criminals, including Henry Lipde and Yu Zongbin, were arrested successively. Three American SST-1-E type 15-watt special agent transmitters, one SSR-1-G type 15-watt special agent receiver, one SSP-1-D type 15-watt special agent power supply, one 50-watt transmitter, one 50-watt power supply, a total of forty-one spare vacuum tubes and crystals, four English codebooks for espionage, two hundred and ninety English code sheets photographed on 32mm Leica film, one pistol, fifty bullets, one hundred and nine pieces of evidence including instructions and investigation outlines from American imperialism regarding its espionage activities, American special agent ID cards, and letters from American agents Foster and Jackson, and three boxes of radio equipment, as well as special agent activity funds totaling forty-three taels of gold, seventy-six silver dollars, seven hundred and forty-eight US dollars, and 197,794,000 yuan in Renminbi were seized.
    The Army Strategic Intelligence Unit (S.S.U.) is one of the central organizations of American imperialism's spy activities in China. Its predecessor was a department of the American imperialist Strategic Intelligence Bureau (OSS). Its agency in China was renamed "Overseas Observation Team 44th Detachment" (ESD44) at the end of 1947 and the beginning of 1948. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the American Strategic Bureau was engaged in espionage activities in our country. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it extensively recruited German Nazi spies, Japanese special agents, White Russians, and other anti-communist personnel in North China, Northeast China, and major cities such as Peiping and Tianjin, and colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to buy off pro-foreign lackeys to carry out espionage activities under the cover of various occupations. They extensively gathered military, political, economic, and cultural intelligence about our country, organized desperadoes to carry out assassinations and sabotage activities, and gathered intelligence about the Soviet Union and Korea. After the organization ended in 1946, part of it became the Army Strategic Intelligence Unit. Before the liberation of Tianjin, this unit, under the name of "U.S. Army Liaison Group," established an agency at 234 Hong Kong Road in the old Tenth District. American Army Major Byrne, Foster, and a large number of bandits were sent successively as spy chiefs. They used German Nazi "Manzhou" intelligence chief Schulz, White Russian anti-communist chief Karunawuh, Japanese special agent Consul Ito, Colonel Koya Yoneichi and others, and colluded with the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense Second Department Investigation Office to extensively develop organizations and collect intelligence.
    In 1948, the Strategic Intelligence Unit's open special agent agency in Tianjin withdrew and arranged a lurking organization in Tianjin. In February 1948, Jackson transferred Gu Zongfan, a telegraph operator from the American special agent agency at No. 38, Dongsi Liutiao, Beiping, to Tianjin, ordering him to set up a secret radio station. After receiving the order, Gu set up the radio station given to him by Jackson at his brother Gu Zongde's residence (Tianjin Telecommunications First Branch Dormitory), and first sent secret telegrams to the American special agent chief White Russian Difrank. On November 15 of the same year, Jackson handed over Gu Zongfan and the radio station to Yu Zongbin, an employee of the accounting section of the American special agent Tianjin Kailuan Mining Bureau, and gave Yu Zongbin a work plan and two months' salary of 300 US dollars, ordering Yu to not only actively operate in Tianjin, but also send people to Harbin, Jiamusi and other places to carry out activities, focusing on investigating the military situation of the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stipulating that this intelligence should be sent via radio. After the liberation of Tianjin, the criminals actively carried out activities and sent more than 60 important intelligence reports to the American special agent agency. During this period, the American special agent agency secretly allocated US$3,600 through the Tianjin French-owned "Banque de l'Indochine" and the "Far East Fur Company" for Yu, Gu, and others to use.
    In April 1950, criminals Yu Zongbin, Gu Zongfan and others agreed that Gu would take Yu's letter to Hong Kong to meet Jackson. On April 22, Gu committed the crime of disguising himself as an electrical appliance merchant and set off from Beijing. After arriving in Hong Kong, he went to the American Consulate General to see Jackson. The American Consulate General claimed not to know this person, but after Gu returned to his residence, he immediately received a letter inviting Gu to meet at the New New Restaurant and Tsim Sha Tsui Wharf, where Gu reported the situation. Soon, Gu met with American special agents at the New New Hotel, accepted 290 code sheets, more than 40 crystals, and work instructions (the content was to strengthen the investigation of our economic construction, military strength and equipment, and the addresses of military and government agencies) given to him by the American special agents; at that time, Gu's communication procedures, call signs, wavelengths, etc. were also stipulated, and it was agreed that Gu would use the test address of No. 7, Dayanli, Luyi Road, Hebei, Tianjin. American special agents use Hong Kong mailbox No. 339 and "T.Y.LEE" or "Wu Hong" as code names to communicate with each other. The American special agent also ordered Gu to find a ship after returning to Tianjin and contact him at sea on the specified date and longitude and latitude. Gu committed the crime of leaving Hong Kong on July 4 and returning to Tianjin. On August 4, he received a remittance of more than 170 million yuan in Renminbi from the American special agent in Hong Kong. Since then, Gu has frequently contacted the American special agent in Hong Kong using the predetermined code name.
    The main person in charge of another lurking agency of the American spy agency in Tianjin was Li Pude, the sales director of the import department of Tianjin Jardine Matheson. Li Pude is an international spy, a White Russian of German descent, who speaks Russian, Chinese, English, Japanese, German and other languages, and is good at compiling codes. During World War II, he had close ties with Japanese special agents and German Nazis, served as a member of the "White Russian Anti-Communist Committee," and was a close friend of White Russian American special agent Difrank. In September 1947, he joined the American special agent organization through Di's introduction. Difrank's office was located in Li Pude's home. When Difrank fled south on the eve of the liberation of Tianjin in 1948, he designated Gu Zongfan's radio station for Li to use and gave Li US dollars and gold as activity funds. After the liberation of Tianjin, Li Pude contacted Gu Zongfan twice a week and sent various telegrams at the same time. Li Pude was an important intelligence officer under Jackson. The American intelligence agency gave him a salary increase and bonus because the intelligence he sent was of great value. During this period, Jackson allocated US$3,000 in activity funds to Li Pude and Gu Zongfan from New York, USA. Of this amount, 1,000 yuan was obtained by Li Pude through the hands of German Nazi Dong Sheng. Dong Sheng was originally the German Nazi leader stationed in Yantai, Shandong. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he was protected by Yan Xishan along with Li Pude and was not repatriated to his country. After the liberation of Tianjin, Dong Sheng sneaked into our North China Foreign Trade Company and stole our national trade secrets.
    After the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau investigated the above situation, it has arrested twenty-one Chinese and foreign spy criminals. These criminals, who are resolutely hostile to the people and undermine our people's democratic cause, will be prosecuted according to law and severely punished.

    天津破获美国间谍组织
    捕获中外籍间谍罪犯二十一名
    【本报讯】天津市人民政府公安局经长期侦察，于最近破获美帝国主义间谍机关陆军战略情报处（Ｓ．Ｓ．u．）在天津的潜伏组织，先后逮捕中外籍美 国间谍案犯亨利·李普德、余宗斌等二十一人，缴获美国ＳＳＴ—１—Ｅ型十五瓦特特工发报机三部，ＳＳＲ—１—Ｇ型十五瓦特特工收报机一部，ＳＳＰ—１—Ｄ型十五瓦特特工电源一部，五十瓦特发报机一部，五十瓦特电源一部，备用真空管、水晶体共四十一件，谍报用英文密码四本，摄于三十二米厘莱克胶片上的英文密码二百九十张，手枪一支，子弹五十粒，美帝国主义对其间谍工作的指示、调查大纲、美国特务身份证件、美国特务福斯特及杰克森来信等罪证一百零九件，并缴获电台器材三箱及特务活动经费黄金四十三两、银元七十六枚、美钞七百四十八元、人民币一亿九千七百九十四万元。
    陆军战略情报处（Ｓ．Ｓ．Ｕ．）为美帝国主义在华间谍活动的中心组织之一。其前身是美帝国主义战略情报局（ＯＳＳ）的一个部门。其在华机关于一九四七年末一九四八年初改为“海外观察队第四十四支队”（ＥＳＤ44）。远在抗日战争期间，美国战略局即在我国进行特务活动，抗战胜利后，又在华北、东北以及北平、天津等大城市大量搜罗德国纳粹间谍、日本特务、白俄等反共人员，并勾结蒋匪帮收买媚外奴才，在各种职业掩护下进行间谍活动。他们广泛刺探我国军事、政治、经济及文化情报，组织亡命徒进行暗杀、破坏活动，并刺探苏联、朝鲜情报。该组织于一九四六年结束后，其中一部分成为陆军战略情报处。该处在天津解放前以“美陆军联络团”（Ｕ．Ｓ．Ａrmy Ｌiaison Ｇroup）名义，设机关于旧十区香港道二百三十四号，先后派来间谍头目美国陆军少校柏恩、福斯特及大批匪徒，使用德国纳粹“满洲”情报头子舒尔兹、白俄反共头子卡路那武赫、日本特务伊藤领事、古谷米一上校等多人，勾结国民党国防部二厅稽查处，大量发展组织，收集情报。
    一九四八年，战略情报处在天津的公开特务机关撤逃，并在天津布置了潜伏组织。一九四八年二月，杰克森将北平东四六条三十八号美国特务机关电报员顾宗范调至天津，命其设立秘密电台。顾受命后，即将杰克森交给的电台设于其兄顾宗德的住处（天津电信一分局宿舍），首先为美国特务头目白俄狄弗兰克拍发秘密电讯。同年十一月十五日，杰克森将顾宗范及该电台交与美国特务天津开滦矿务局会计科职员余宗斌，并交与余宗斌工作计划及两月薪金三百美元，命余除个人在天津积极活动外，并派人赴哈尔滨、佳木斯等地进行活动，着重调查苏联及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军事情况，规定此项情报经由电台发送。天津解放后，罪犯们积极展开活动，前后共向美国特务机关发出重要情报六十余件。其间，美国特务机关曾经由天津法商“东方汇理银行”及“远东皮毛公司”密拨美金三千六百元，为余、顾等分用。
    一九五○年四月，余宗斌、顾宗范等犯商妥由顾持余函赴香港会见杰克森。四月二十二日，顾犯伪装电器商人，由北京启程。到香港后，即至美国总领事馆求见杰克森。美总领事馆诡称不知此人，但顾犯回寓后，立即接到一函，约顾犯至新新餐厅及尖沙嘴码头相见，由顾汇报情况。不久，顾即在新新旅社与美国特务会面，接受了美国特务交给的密码胶片二百九十张，水晶体四十余个及工作指示（内容为加强对我经济建设状况、军事实力与设备、军政机关地址等的调查）；当时并规定了顾之通讯程序、呼号、波长等，约定顾以天津河北吕纬路大沿里七号兄弟电器行为地址、美国特务以香港邮箱三三九号及“Ｔ．Ｙ．ＬＥＥ”或“武鸿”为代号互相通讯联络。美国特务又命顾返回天津后觅取船只，按指定日期及经纬度在海上联络。顾犯于七月四日离开香港，回到天津后，于八月四日收到香港美国特务兑来的接济费人民币一亿七千余万元。此后顾犯即与香港美国特务经常以预定的代号联络。
    该美间谍机关在天津另一潜伏机关的主要负责人是天津怡和洋行进口部售货主任李普德。李普德为国际间谍，系德国血统的白俄，会俄、中、英、日、德等国语言，擅长编制密码。第二次世界大战期间，与日本特务、德国纳粹往来甚密，充任“白俄反共委员会”委员，与白俄美国特务狄弗兰克为密友。一九四七年九月，经狄介绍参加美国特务组织。狄弗兰克的办公室即设于李普德家中。一九四八年天津解放前夕，狄弗兰克南逃时指定顾宗范的电台供李使用，并交李以美元、黄金，作为活动经费。天津解放后，李普德与顾宗范每周联络两次，同时拍发各种电报。李普德为杰克森手下的重要情报人员，美国谍报机关因其所发情报具有很大价值，曾予以增薪奖励。其间，杰克森曾自美国纽约拨给李普德、顾宗范活动经费三千美元。其中一千元已经由德国纳粹分子董盛之手为李普德得到。董盛原为驻山东烟台的德国纳粹首领，抗日战争胜利后，与李普德同受阎匪锡山的保护，未被遣送回国。天津解放后，董盛混入我华北对外贸易公司，偷窃我国家贸易机密。
    天津市人民政府公安局侦得上述情况后，已将中外籍间谍案犯二十一人予以逮捕。这些坚决与人民为敌，破坏我人民民主事业的罪犯，将被依法起诉，受到严厉制裁。
