　　Review of "Red Flag on Mount Cui Gang"
    Yan Meng
    "Red Flag on Mount Cui Gang" is a film reflecting the revolutionary struggle of the people of Jiangxi. It depicts the hatred of the local people for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and fully exposes the atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit army—the "Communist Eradication Corps"—in looting, burning, killing, and committing all kinds of evils. The film also depicts the joy of the people's victory at the end: the people's army has returned, the red flag is raised high on Mount Cui Gang, Feng Zhigu, the representative of the feudal landlord class, is killed, and Xiao Zhenkui, the murderous bandit leader, is captured alive.
    This is a great epic that will forever remain in the memory of the Chinese people.
    The theme of the film revolves around the unfortunate experiences of the two families of peasant Jiang Chunwang and Feng Lao Si. The time is 1933, in a place called Jiangying in the Jiangxi Soviet area. At that time, the Red Army had just smashed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's fourth encirclement. However, the people knew that the Chiang bandits would never accept defeat and might launch even greater offensives. Therefore, they shouted out the demand to expand the Red Army, and Jiang Mengzi, the son of Jiang Chunwang, chairman of the Jiangying Township Farmers' Association, was the first to sign up to join the Red Army.
    In 1934, the Red Army began the Long March, and Mengzi also went north with the army.
    After the Red Army left, the reactionaries invaded the Soviet area. Thus, the beautiful Jiangying Township became a living hell, and a tragic life began. The land was taken back, the houses were turned into ruins, the cattle were taken away, and the farm implements were robbed. The family members of the Red Army were all poisoned by the executioner Xiao Zhenkui. Jiang Chunwang was hanged alive, his daughter Linzi was also shot to death, and his pregnant daughter-in-law Xiang Wu'er (Mengzi's wife) fled. Feng Lao Si's son, Feng Chuangang, like other young people, was forced to join the guerrillas and later became the guerrilla captain.
    However, the reactionary rule did not last long, and it collapsed in the face of the powerful People's Liberation Army. The people finally gained liberation, the Feng Lao Si family reunited, and Jiang Mengzi also saw his wife, son, and blind aunt. Because the commander of this powerful corps was Jiang Commander (Mengzi) himself.
    A moving scene appeared on the screen: the ranks of the liberation army stretched endlessly into the mountains, the cavalry marched across the bridgehead, and the artillery advanced.
    We can understand the creative intention of the screenwriter and director. They attempt to reflect the long-term and arduous nature of the revolutionary struggle of the people in the Soviet area of Jiangxi at that time through this vivid story, so that the broad masses can know how the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army—the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—overcame difficulties and fought the enemy.
    This theme is completely correct, good, and fresh. It writes about the heroic struggle of the people in the Jiangxi Soviet Area during the land revolution from a certain aspect. However, the film's presentation of this theme is not powerful enough. It excessively depicts the dark aspects of reactionary rule, while depicting very few of the active aspects—the scenes of the people's struggle. For example, the activities of the guerrillas only appeared occasionally, and at the same time, it did not write about its close connection with the people. This weakens the film's ideology.
    The leadership problem of the mass struggle is also not written enough, and it appears weak and powerless. The guerrilla team led by Feng Chuangang was an important force in the Jiangying Township area at that time to persist in the struggle against the enemy, but how did this team grow up? What is the leading role of the Party? The film does not fully depict it. This gives people the feeling that this armed force lacks leadership, but without the leadership of the Party or the weak leadership of the Party, the victory of the people's struggle is unimaginable.
    In the characterization, the images of Feng Lao Si and Xiang Wu'er are more prominent and distinct. Feng Lao Si—the father of guerrilla captain Feng Chuangang, is a simple and hard-working farmer. He believes that "the Red Army will definitely return." He loves Chairman Mao, misses the people's army, and hates the enemies of the people. He endured all the tortures and never betrayed his fellow villagers and son. Xiang Wu'er is an image of a loyal daughter of the people. The character that the film portrays for her is commensurate with her identity. After her husband followed the army on the Long March, although she became the nanny of Feng Zhigu under the pressure of Feng Zhigu, using her own milk to feed Feng Zhigu's son, while letting her child cry for lack of milk, she did not forget her father who was killed by Xiao Zhenkui, the head of the Chiang bandits' "Communist Eradication Corps," nor did she forget the humiliation suffered by her child Xiao Hong; she cares about the fate of the people's guerrillas and yearns for future victory. In extremely difficult circumstances, she inspires her son's flame of revenge and places her hope on him.
    The film's characterization of Jiang Mengzi (i.e., Jiang Commander) is not deep enough, and it is only when the story develops to its climax that he is given touching power, making him a flesh-and-blood image. The image of Feng Chuangang, as the guerrilla captain, is not distinctly portrayed and lacks appeal, thus giving the audience a vague impression and passing before their eyes in a flash. This is an oversight by the screenwriters and directors in handling the character's personality. Because not long after the Red Army left Jiangying Township, Feng Chuangang had become the leader of the guerrillas and the core of the local armed forces. However, the film treats him as an accidental general character and does not strongly express his connection with the masses from the development of the events. The emergence of this shortcoming is related to the screenwriters and directors' lack of a firm grasp of the theme.
    Although this film is not detailed and profound enough in the characterization of the characters, and not tight enough in the grasp of the theme, it is still of great educational significance to us. (Editor's note: This film will be released tomorrow)

### 评《翠岗红旗》

　　评《翠岗红旗》
    严蒙
    《翠岗红旗》是一部反映江西人民革命斗争的影片。它写出了当地人民对蒋介石匪帮的仇恨，尽情地暴露了国民党匪军——“铲共团”抢掠烧杀，无恶不作的暴行。影片在最后也写出了人民的胜利喜悦：人民的队伍回来了，巍巍的翠岗山上扬起了红旗，作为封建地主阶级代表的封之固被打死了，杀人不眨眼的匪首萧镇魁被活捉了。
    这是一部伟大的史诗，它将永远留存在中国人民的记忆里。
    影片的主题，是围绕着农民江春旺和封老四两个家庭的不幸遭遇展开的。时间是一九三三年，在江西苏区一个叫江莹的地方。那时，红军正粉碎了蒋介石匪帮的四次进攻。但是，人民知道，蒋匪是决不甘心于失败的，还可能发动更大的进攻。于是，他们喊出了扩大红军的要求，江莹乡农会主席春旺的儿子江猛子第一个报名参加了红军。
    一九三四年，红军开始长征，猛子也随军北上了。
    红军离开以后，反动派侵入了苏区。于是，美丽的江莹乡变成了人间地狱，悲惨的生活开始了。土地被夺回去了，庐舍变成了废墟，耕牛被牵去，农具被抢走。红军家属都遭到了刽子手萧镇魁的毒手。江春旺被活活地吊死，她的女儿林仔也惨遭枪杀，怀着孕的儿媳向五儿（猛子的妻子）逃亡了。封老四的儿子封传刚和其他青年一样，被逼参加了游击队，后来并当了游击队长。
    然而，反动统治没有维持得多久，它在强大的人民解放军面前土崩瓦解了。人民获得了最后的解放，封老四家父子团聚了，江猛子也见到了自己的妻子、儿子和瞎了两眼的婶母。因为领导这个强大兵团的正是江师长（猛子）自己。
    银幕上出现了动人的镜头：解放大军的队伍在山岗中延绵不绝而至，骑兵的行列踏过桥头，炮兵的行列在前进。
    编剧和导演者的创作意图，我们是可以理解的。他们企图通过这个生动的故事来反映当时苏区人民革命斗争的长期性和艰苦性，让广大的群众知道人民解放军的前身——中国工农红军是怎样克服困难的，是怎样和敌人战斗过来的。
    这个主题是完全正确的、好的、新鲜的，它从一个侧面写出了土地革命时期江西苏区人民的英勇斗争。但影片对于这个主题的表现是不够有力的，它过多地描写了反动统治的黑暗方面，而对于积极的方面——人民斗争的场面却写得很少。例如游击队的活动只是偶然地出现了一下，同时也没有写出它与人民的紧密联系。这就减弱了影片的思想性。
    对于群众斗争的领导问题，也是写得不够的，而且显得贫弱无力。封传刚所领导的这支游击队，是当时江莹乡地区坚持对敌斗争的一个重要力量，可是这支队伍是怎样生长起来的呢？党的领导作用又是怎样？影片都没有加以充分的描画。这样就使人感觉到这个武装力量是缺乏领导的，然而没有党的领导或者党的领导薄弱，人民斗争的胜利是不可想像的。
    在人物的刻画上，封老四和向五儿的形象是比较凸出、鲜明的。封老四——游击队长封传刚的父亲，是一个纯朴耐劳的农民，他相信着“红军一定要回来的”。他热爱着毛主席，怀念着人民的队伍，而对人民的敌人则憎恨万分。他忍受了一切的酷刑，始终没有背叛自己的乡亲和儿子。向五儿是一个人民忠实女儿的形象。影片对她所刻画的性格是和她的身份相称的。她于丈夫随军长征以后，虽然在封之固的压迫下当了他家的奶妈，用自己的奶去喂养封之固的儿子，而让她的孩子因缺奶而号哭，可是，她没有忘记为蒋匪“铲共团”团长萧镇魁所杀害的父亲，也没有忘记自己的孩子小鸿所受到的殴辱；她关心着人民游击队的命运，向往着未来的胜利。她在万分困难的情况时，激励着儿子的复仇火焰，并把希望寄托在他的身上。
    影片对于江猛子（即江师长）这个人物的刻画是不够深刻的，而只有在故事发展到顶点的时候，才赋予他以感人的力量，使他成为有血有肉的形象。作为游击队长的封传刚这个人物的形象，是刻画不鲜明的，缺乏感染力，因此给予观众以模糊的印象，在人们的眼前一幌就过去了。这是编导者在人物性格处理上的一个疏忽。因为当时在红军离开江莹乡以后不久，封传刚已成为游击队的领导者，当地武装力量的核心。而影片却把他作为一个偶然的一般的人物来处理，没有从事件的发展中强烈地表现他与群众的联系。这个缺点的产生，是和编导对主题思想的掌握不紧有关系的。
    这部影片虽然在人物性格的刻画上不够细致、深刻，在主题思想的掌握上不够紧，但对于我们还是有极大教育意义的。（编者按：此片将于明日公映）
