    Taiyuan Railway Bureau Employees Endorse the Labor Insurance Regulations
    To the Editor:
    After the publication of the Labor Insurance Regulations in the newspaper, all employees of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau were elated and enthusiastically endorsed the government's decision to protect the interests of workers. Chen Yongshun, an old worker with 53 years of railway experience, said: "I never thought that I, an old man of 77, would be able to catch up with this good thing. I felt several years younger when I heard this good news. I "will definitely work harder to repay Chairman Mao's kindness." Nurse Liu Guozheng recalled the miserable situation of her father, Liu Zengxiang, who worked for more than 20 years on railways run by British, French, and Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan cliques and eventually starved to death in Taiyuan without anyone caring for him. Comparing this to the government's publication of the Labor Insurance Regulations to protect the interests of workers today, she was moved to tears and said: "The People's Government takes such meticulous care of us. If my father were still alive, our lives would be even happier!" Engineer Wang Yi said: "Only the government under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao would care for us workers in such an unprecedented way. I must work harder, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan in order to protect our peaceful and happy life." The staff of the General Affairs Department also organized six propaganda groups to go to the workers' dormitories in their spare time to publicize the Labor Insurance Regulations to their families.

    太原铁路局职工拥护劳动保险条例编辑同志：
    劳动保险条例在报上公布后，太原铁路局全体职工都欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护政府这一保护工人利益的决定。有五十三年铁路工龄的老工友陈永顺说：“真想不到，我这七十七岁的老汉，还能赶上这个好事。我听到了这个喜讯，简直年轻了几岁。我“定要更好地工作，来报答毛主席的恩情，”护士刘国正回忆她父亲刘增湘在英、法帝国主义和蒋阎匪帮办的铁路上，做了二十多年活，最后活活饿死在太原没人管的凄惨景况，和今天政府公布了保护工人利益的劳动保险条例相比较，感动得流泪说：“人民政府这样无微不至地照顾我们，假使我父亲还在世的话，我们的生活更会幸福呀！”工程师汪毅说：“只有共产党毛主席领导下的政府，才会这样史无前例地对我们工人这样照顾。我一定要更好地干活，加强抗美援朝工作，反对美帝国主义武装日本，以保护我们和平幸福的生活。”总务处的职工并组织了六个宣传小组，在业余时间，分赴职工宿舍给家属们宣传劳动保险条例。
