　　Eleven Days and Nights on White Cloud Mountain
    ——Five Reports from the Battle on the South Bank of the Han River
    By Our Reporter Lin Wei
    What is recorded here are some heroic battle stories from the eleven-day and night defensive battle in the White Cloud Mountain area on the south bank of the Han River. These battles resoundingly tell the people of the world: The Chinese and Korean People's forces, who have victoriously struck at the American aggressors, are continuously dealing even heavier blows to the American aggressors. We are marching from victory to victory. The enemy's death throes—risky counterattacks—cannot save them from their final defeat.
    The White Cloud Mountain area is ten kilometers long from north to south and fifteen kilometers wide from east to west. The eastern and western sides are close to the highway and railway connecting Suwon to Seoul. Another highway runs directly from Suwon to the foot of the main peak of White Cloud Mountain. Major roads crisscross between the various heights, and wide trenches connect them, making the terrain very suitable for enemy vehicle movement. Not far behind the mountains is the Han River plain. From a military point of view, this area is not conducive to defense. However, because of its high altitude (the main peak reaches 540 meters above sea level), it is of great value for controlling the roads and railways on the left and right, so it has become one of the most important positions in the defensive battle on the south bank of the Han River.
    After January 25th, more than 200,000 invading troops, led by the U.S. military, risked a counterattack on the south bank of the Han River, declaring that they would seize all the positions of the Chinese and Korean People's forces on the south bank of the Han River within seven days. They used an average of no less than three divisions, five or six0,000 men, on the front of the White Cloud Mountain area every day. They used a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks to pave the way for their infantry, and every soldier carried automatic weapons. The defenders of the White Cloud Mountain area were merely a regiment of the People's Volunteer Army, equipped only with light weapons, with a number less than one-twentieth of the enemy's. The regiment's original mission was to hold off the enemy for seven days, but the fierce battle lasted for eleven days and nights, and the regiment remained unmoved. It was not until the night of February 5th, when the higher command ordered a voluntary transfer, that they withdrew. More than 2,400 American soldiers buried their shameful lives here.
            I. A Battle Prelude that Inspired the Entire Regiment
    The heroic battle to defend White Cloud Mountain began with a surprise attack on the advancing enemy. Eighteen warriors from the Eighth Company stormed into Suwon, hacking the enemy inside and outside the city to pieces. This was a battle prelude that inspired the entire regiment. For the already low morale of the U.S. military, it was a heavy blow. They were fundamentally overwhelmed spiritually by the warriors.
    The U.S. military re-entered the vacuum city of Suwon on the night of January 25th. A full battalion of the U.S. 25th Division, about 500 men, was stationed inside and outside the city. The heroic Eighth Company accepted the mission from their superiors: led by Deputy Battalion Commander Dai Ruji of the Third Battalion, to scout out the enemy's situation and carry out an attack, disrupting the enemy's plans and deployments.
    The night was pitch black. There were enemies on the heights on both sides of the main road north of the city. The warriors fearlessly followed the main road, heading straight for the city gate. The first U.S. sentry challenged them for the password, but the warriors ignored them. The second sentry continued to ask for the password, but the warriors still ignored them. Carbines fired head-on, but the warriors didn't even bend over, proceeding as usual. Two machine guns on the left front tore through the night sky with screams, and three comrades were wounded, which angered the warriors. The two leading warriors pounced forward, and two grenades sent the two machine guns running with two loud bangs. Everyone continued to advance.
    Near the city gate, Deputy Battalion Commander Dai Ruji blew the majestic charge of his small horn, which he always carried with him. The enemy's automatic weapons and the warriors' earth-shattering shouts of "Charge!" and "Kill!" roared together. The leading eighteen warriors (several platoon and squad leaders and a dozen soldiers) penetrated into Suwon City through the continuous fire and rain of bullets above and below the city. They lost contact with the follow-up troops, but they didn't turn back, advancing like sharp knives in the invaders' lair. They plunged to the west of the city, then to the south, searching for the enemy everywhere.
    At an intersection, a tank was rumbling and starting up. Deputy Battalion Commander Dai Ruji, who was at the very front, pounced on the vehicle and attacked. The tank suddenly started moving and threw him to the ground. He got up, chased after it, and attacked it with grenades. The tank fled, and he went after the cars. When the cars fled, they rushed into a large western-style house with lights on. There were seven Jeeps parked there, filled with guns, ammunition, and military supplies. After determining that it was definitely a U.S. military post, they used submachine guns and grenades to attack the house. The enemy screamed and ran out in a chaotic rush, but three or five at a time were shot dead in the courtyard by submachine guns. Wu Liang, the deputy of the Third Platoon, led the soldiers into the house to look for survivors, but he was wounded by an enemy hidden in the corner of the room. The deputy battalion commander asked him, "Can you still go on, Wu Liang?" The answer was, "Yes!" After bandaging the wound, he immediately rushed in again. Six or seven American soldiers who were frightened or lying pretending to be dead were all captured alive by the warriors.
    At the same time, the enemies everywhere were awakened from their dreams, running around in a chaotic manner, trying to escape empty-handed. Those who ran near the large western-style house were swept dead on the road by our machine guns blocking the road.
    The warriors created havoc from 9:00 p.m. until after midnight, when the moon rose. An enemy military police platoon in the house was completely annihilated, and all seven Jeeps in the courtyard were burned. Due to time constraints, the warriors, each carrying several carbines, escorted the prisoners, passed through the east gate, and returned victoriously. At this time, the U.S. military in the south of the city was bombarding the U.S. military in the north of the city, causing the U.S. military in the north to scream and howl. The warriors walked along, cheering, "Well done!"
    The high ground along the road outside the east city was also garrisoned by the U.S. military, but they only dared to fire guns and artillery from a distance, and no one dared to chase after them. The enemy's military telegraph lines along the road were also cut by the warriors.
    After climbing over the third hill, they suddenly discovered the enemy's artillery position on the opposite hill. A dark mass of people opened fire on them. The warriors rushed down the hillside, dragging the prisoners across the open ground, advancing on their bellies. The enemy's grenades landed near Chen Youzhi, the platoon leader of the Third Platoon, and he deftly grabbed them and returned them to the enemy.
    Dai Ruji blew the horn a second time, the warriors shouted in unison and rushed forward. The enemy ran away in a puff of smoke from behind the mountain. An 82mm mortar, a 60mm mortar, and piles of shells were abandoned on the top of the mountain. Picks and shovels lay next to the unfinished fortifications.
    While American planes dropped strings of flares to search for the night raiders, the warriors were smoking American cigarettes, eating American canned food, and talking about the strange appearance of American soldiers pretending to be dead and running for their lives on a small hill in front of their own position. They burst into uncontrollable laughter.
            II. The Seven Warriors of Dongyuanli
    During the three consecutive campaigns last winter, when the invading army was defeated and fled hundreds of miles, a U.S. Army second lieutenant who was captured in his sleeping bag said to me with dissatisfaction: "If we were to line up and fight in a regular manner, the U.S. military would not necessarily lose." He felt that the reason the U.S. military was defeated was solely because our army used night battles, close-quarters combat, and flanking encirclement tactics, which prevented their superior weapons from exerting their power. However, the battle in the small woods of Dongyuanli shattered this argument.
    Dongyuanli is located on the highway east of White Cloud Mountain. Going northwest along the road, one can directly attack the side and rear of White Cloud Mountain. Passing through the hilly area to the west, one can flank the important forward position of White Cloud Mountain, the Brothers Peak, and together with the enemy in Guanggyoli on the western highway, form an encirclement of White Cloud Mountain. The heroic Seventh Company, which can attack and defend, was guarding here. In front of Dongyuanli is a small patch of woods, slightly higher than the flat ground, which is a small outpost of this forward position. The defenders were Han Jiazhen, the platoon leader of the First Platoon of the Seventh Company, and the squad leader of the Second Squad, five soldiers, a total of seven people.
    The enemy, advancing north along the highway, used an entire company to specifically attack this small patch of woods. The attackers fully exerted the power of modern weapons. Starting early in the morning, they used eight planes and twelve artillery pieces to concentrate their bombardment on the small woods for a full two hours. The ground was as boiling as a pot of water, with clouds of smoke filling the sky. Tree branches and trunks flew up and then fell down, and the ground turned into a large beehive. However, the enemy was ultimately unable to "attack to the point where soldiers can carry their guns and smoke cigarettes to occupy the position" (as the U.S. military boasted). When their infantry approached within 50 meters of the warriors, eighteen people were shot down by a burst of machine gun and rifle fire. The remaining enemy didn't even drag the corpses away and turned around and ran.
    Planes and artillery, along with tank guns, bombarded fiercely for another half an hour, and the enemy launched a second attack. This time, they divided into two groups, frontal and left, led by four tanks, surging forward. At this time, two of the seven warriors had already been wounded. But the remaining five were even more calm. They waited until the enemy approached within 30 meters before throwing the prepared grenades. With a few loud bangs, fourteen enemies fell, and they ran again.
    This time, the enemy commander went crazy. Six bombers flew together and dropped a large number of gasoline bombs and thousand-kilogram heavy bombs for destroying reinforced concrete buildings. A landslide and earth-shattering roar echoed across the position, fire spread everywhere, and yellow earth turned into black earth. Then, four tanks advanced alone, and tank shells that could penetrate a meter into the ground were fired in piles. They climbed onto the position and repeatedly crushed the broken fortifications.
    In this way, the enemy believed that there would definitely be no living people left on this position, and the infantry swaggered forward. But unexpectedly, a burst of machine gun fire and grenades came from somewhere, knocking down eight more enemies. The infantry fled in terror, and the tanks followed suit.
    At this time, the warriors were hiding in a hard-to-detect bomb crater on the higher ground on the right side. Their machine guns and grenades were specifically aimed at the infantry behind the tanks from the side. Only three of them were left: platoon leader Han Jiazhen, squad leader Cui Hongcheng, and soldier Gao Xiyou.
    After repelling the enemy's third charge, they watched the enemy while talking and laughing victoriously: "If we don't retreat, the enemy will never have a way!" "We are not afraid of the enemy, the enemy is afraid of us!" The platoon leader summarized: "The characteristics of American soldiers are, first, as long as there is still a single shot on the position, they dare not come; second, if one is knocked down, everyone else runs." Gao Xiyou added: "Aim accurately, and one burst will do the trick!" Cui Hongcheng confessed his thoughts: "I haven't made any meritorious service since joining the Party. This time, I must kill more enemies!"
    The sun was about to set, and the platoon leader and squad leader stood up to observe the enemy's situation. Unfortunately, they were hit by a shell and fell to the ground seriously wounded. As he breathed his last breath, the platoon leader ordered Gao Xiyou: "Even if you are the only one left, you must hold on and not allow the enemy to occupy this position! Report back after the enemy retreats!"
    After a round of shelling, the enemy charged for the fourth time. This time, the tanks and infantry came together. Gao Xiyou moved from the bomb crater to behind an earthen ridge, calmly firing the last few bullets. Two enemies fell, and they fled again. Gao Xiyou began to use the gap to sharpen the shovel next to him quickly on the stone, preparing to split a few when the enemy came again. However, the cowardly enemy was terrified and dared not charge again. The total number of enemies killed or wounded in this small patch of woods that day was forty-two. This is the result of "lining up and fighting in a regular manner." (14)
            III. The Battle for Brothers Peak
    The few small heights of Brothers Peak, the forward position on the front of White Cloud Mountain, were often defended by no more than a hundred or dozens of soldiers. In addition to the constant bombing and shelling, the enemy often used forces of four or five hundred to even a thousand men to carry out fierce attacks. However, from the 26th to the night of the 31st, the enemy was never able to achieve its goal. In the four days after the 28th, the enemy had taken one or two hilltops every day with overwhelming force, but each time they took the same hilltops. This was because the brave defenders carried out fierce counterattacks every night (sometimes during the day), driving the enemy back to their original positions. In one counterattack led by Li Gaiwen, the deputy battalion commander of the Second Battalion, and Guo Jiaxing, the company commander of the Sixth Company, they had penetrated from Brothers Peak all the way to the enemy stronghold of Duling on the highway, annihilating a U.S. military battalion headquarters, burning five vehicles, and killing dozens of enemies. On the hilltop behind Duling, Guo Jiaxing led a signalman alone to the front of more than sixty enemies. First, he used grenades, then he used his Mauser pistol, and then he used the rifle carried by the signalman. After everything was used up, he knocked down an enemy with the gun without a bayonet. Later, he was unfortunately wounded and died heroically. He killed more than twenty enemies on this hilltop alone. The heroes defending Brothers Peak were filled with this fearless spirit of attack from beginning to end.
    On the last day of the battle for Brothers Peak, January 31st, the enemy's bombing and shelling began at 7:00 a.m. The dense artillery shells and bombs turned the several hilltops into a sea of fire. Ten times the number of U.S. infantry, covered by twenty tanks and more than ten heavy machine guns, surrounded the hilltop in front of Brothers Peak. The enemy's charges could no longer be counted. If the enemy was pushed back dozens of meters on this side, the enemy commander would immediately force the soldiers to climb up from elsewhere. When the situation was already very critical, Li Gaiwen, the deputy battalion commander of the Second Battalion, replied to the battalion commander on the phone: "Don't worry! As long as I, Li Gaiwen, am here, Brothers Peak will not be lost!"
    The fifty-plus heroes of the Sixth Company defending Brothers Peak had lost the support of their fortifications for the most part, and their ammunition was gradually running low. To save ammunition, the distance at which they were now shooting at the enemy was not fifty or forty meters, but thirty, twenty, or even five meters.
    Before noon, telephone contact with the battalion headquarters was also cut off. Li Gaiwen ordered everyone to split up into groups of three or five, each finding favorable terrain and features, firing cold shots everywhere, consuming the enemy, tiring the enemy, waiting for a counterattack in the evening. After that, the warriors had been stubbornly persisting beside rocks, behind trees, in bomb craters, and in the dead angles of artillery shells. In the afternoon, the enemy reinforced with more than 300 troops, determined to seize this position. But they were beaten back until dark.
    Xiong Jiaxing, the political instructor of the Sixth Company, and three soldiers naturally formed a combat team, persisting under the small trees and behind the large rocks on the higher ground behind the mountain. One person monitored one direction. Thirty, fifty, and later more than a hundred enemies climbed up the mountain from here, and each time they were beaten down by the four heroes, falling one after another. In the end, the instructor had only a few grenades and a Mauser pistol left. He used his right hand to throw grenades, his left hand to load the Mauser pistol, and then his right hand to fire the Mauser pistol, and his left hand to uncover the grenade. Finally, he repelled the enemy. Until 3:00 p.m., the enemy was still helpless. At this time, all the ammunition of the heroes was completely used up, so they used the gap when the enemy was beaten back to search on the ground. Just as they were anxious, the signalman of the battalion headquarters suddenly climbed up the mountain from somewhere, bringing eighty grenades. After using more than twenty to repel the enemy's two new charges, the enemy was exhausted and dozed off halfway up the mountain. The instructor was now fearless, and maliciously picked up a bullet and fired a shot at the enemy, cursing: "Damn it, you can't attack, but you still have to attack." The enemy pounced like mad dogs and were knocked down again.
    In this way, more than fifty comrades persisted until dark under the fierce attack of nearly a thousand enemies, killing or wounding more than 300 enemies. The position stood firm and unmoved. After the enemy retreated, Li Gaiwen began to set up sentry posts everywhere, and asked the regiment for instructions on the direction and task for the night and tomorrow.
            IV. The Heroes of Baiyun Temple
    How clear and cheerful were the heroes' moods as they fought day and night with disparate forces and equipment! Dai Ruji, the deputy battalion commander of the Third Battalion, who was wounded in the battle at Baiyun Temple on the western flank of White Cloud Mountain, once wrote a letter from the hospital to the regiment leaders, in which he wrote:
    "...In Suwon, in Dongyuanli, and at the western end of White Cloud Mountain, the comrades have shown a fierce and tenacious hard-boned spirit in previous battles. Remembering your call, remembering the task given to us by the Party, our hearts are bright.
    "We will never forget the education the Party has given us and the spiritual appeal of thousands of martyrs. In the most tragic moments of the battle, we thought of Dong Cunrui (this was the blasting hero in the battle of Longhua on the outskirts of Chengde in 1948. He held a dynamite pack in his left hand and pulled the fuse with his right hand, blowing up the high bunker and sacrificing himself heroically - reporter) and the tragic scenes we have seen since entering Korea. Our eyes turned red, and we don't know where the strength came from to be so great.) (The following all writes about the battle of Baiyun Temple - reporter) Chen Weide (the newly appointed platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Seventh Company - reporter) shouted, carrying a submachine gun: "Damn you, dare to come!" With one burst, a large pile of young American soldiers rolled down. One burst, one burst, the young soldiers can't come up. They have to use cannons to bombard and burn. Platoon Leader Chen, a brave man! He smiled and sacrificed at his post. Chen Guodong (the deputy platoon leader of the Third Platoon of the Seventh Company - reporter) did not retreat when he was wounded, firing grenades when the bullets ran out, and encouraging the comrades back and forth. Xu Duanping (the communications squad leader - reporter) relayed the orders of the superiors back and forth in the rain of bullets and piles of fire, encouraging the comrades to carry forward the glory of the Second Squad (referring to the seven heroes of Dongyuanli - reporter), and did not complain about his serious injuries. When the grenades next to him ran out, he had no choice but to throw out the newly issued anti-tank explosives with a heavy heart. The sound was earth-shattering; the snow was on fire, the rocks were on fire, and the young soldiers did not know what kind of treasure it was, so they dared not approach it again.
    "Instructor Song, the hard bone of the proletariat, a great Communist Party member. Four grenades were horizontally inserted in his waist. The carbine was destroyed by artillery fire, and he replaced it with a submachine gun. No matter what fire or bullets, he jumped to the east and ran to the west: "Comrades, let's fight with the devils!" The shouting inspired the hearts of the comrades in each post. The enemy pushed me flat from all directions, and Instructor Song jumped over and shouted to me: "Chief, let's fight!" I said: "Yes! Even if there are only two of us left, we must fight! Pay attention to the highway!" He gritted his teeth, carrying a grenade and left. A round of shelling on the position, with red flames, thick smoke filled the mountain, and from then on, I never heard Instructor Song's loud voice of "Let's fight with the devils!" Instructor Song may have sacrificed, Instructor Song's voice and name will always be in our hearts. (The regiment's political organ notes: "Song did indeed sacrifice, a glorious sacrifice! An excellent political worker in the company, immortal!")
    "Chief: We know the importance of the task. At the most intense time of the battle, we used our main force to reinforce the Ninth Company. Although the bullets ran out, the position was bombed, bombarded, and burned, and there were not many people left, we still stubbornly guarded our posts. No matter how many shortcomings and loopholes there were in the battle, the Seventh Company did not get discouraged (did not become "cowards" - reporter), only more experience.
    "...My left index finger and thumb may lose their function, and the wound is now festering. It doesn't matter: my right hand can still write, and I can still throw grenades and shoot guns. I know who hit my hand, I won't die, I still have to work, and I have to work even harder. ...I want to strive to return to the troops soon."
    On the morning of February 1st, several important cadres of the Eighth Company, who were guarding Baiyun Temple, were wounded, and the situation of the entire position suddenly became tense. Dai Ruji threw down his rice bowl, grabbed a handful of dry rice flakes with his left hand, grabbed a handful of pickled cabbage and chili peppers with his right hand, called over two machine guns, and ran to Baiyun Temple like a gust of wind while eating. His horn blew, the machine gun shouted, and the entire position immediately stabilized, continuing to fight stubbornly. He commanded a dozen soldiers and confronted hundreds of enemies until 3:00 p.m. When the bullets were running out, the enemy attacked even more urgently, and the instructor of the machine gun company advised him to leave the dangerous area. He said: "I will not retreat! I have to fight to the end! If I sacrifice, I only ask the Party to posthumously recognize me as a Communist Party member!" He used the last three bullets to knock down two enemies, and kept one bullet in reserve to shoot himself if necessary. Coincidentally, the Seventh Company arrived, immediately counterattacked, and rescued them. After that, he continued to fight on the front line until he was seriously wounded in his left hand.
    Song Shiyun, the political instructor of the Seventh Company, commanded the Seventh Company in a fierce battle in Dongyuanli for a day on the 31st, and received an emergency order in the evening to send the Seventh Company to reinforce Baiyun Temple. They acted without eating. They stumbled around all night, but mistakenly went to the regimental headquarters at dawn. Without touching his seat, he rushed to Baiyun Temple again. He arrived at 3:00 p.m., and the Eighth Company was in a critical situation. Instructor Song immediately led the team to launch a counterattack, charging down five hilltops in one breath with lightning speed, driving the enemy back to the highway. Having not eaten or rested for two days and nights, and the battle was so tense, he finally fainted on the fifth hilltop. He was carried down without resting, and the next day this iron warrior went to the front line again.
    On the 3rd, the enemy's offensive reached its climax. When hundreds of enemies pushed forward from all directions, he grabbed a submachine gun and shot with it, grabbed a grenade and threw it. After discussing the "fight to the end" strategy with Deputy Battalion Commander Dai, he passed through the dense artillery fire and ran to the front of the position, near the highway, the place closest to the enemy. He picked up a light machine gun from a fallen comrade, and ran to wherever it was dangerous to fight. He shot down piles and piles of enemies on the hillside. When the enemy surrounded from the side and rear, he had already been wounded in the head. Blood was all over his face, and his clothes were also stained red. He turned back holding the machine gun, gritted his teeth and fired fiercely. Finally, he was hit in the abdomen and chest at the same time, and this twenty-one-year-old excellent company political worker gloriously sacrificed at his post. His hands were always holding the machine gun, and the muzzle was pointing straight at the barbaric and brutal enemy. At this time, the heroes of the First Company arrived, and then with a brave counterattack, drove hundreds of enemies back to their original place, and twice in a row defeated the enemy's counter-charge.
            V. "The Americans are fighting our fortifications!"
    The enemy's offensive against the White Cloud Mountain area began by concentrating forces to attack one point, but it was ineffective; then they changed to a full-scale attack, which was still ineffective; then they focused on attacking one point again; then a full-scale attack again; the attack method changed again and again, and in the end, all failed. In early February, the enemy adopted a flanking tactic and fiercely attacked the Gufenxian area behind White Cloud Mountain, paying the price of hundreds of people, but with no progress. On the main peak of White Cloud Mountain, if a fierce attack failed today, they would bombard and burn it all day tomorrow, and then attack from the front, attack from the side, and attack at the same time. By February 5th, the roots of the trees on the top of White Cloud Mountain were blasted out of the soil, the knee-deep snow was blasted away, and the entire terrain had changed. On the top of a fortification, nine, twelve, or even twenty artillery shells could land. However, the enemy's infantry could only be shot down in piles on the hillside, unable to reach the top of the mountain. After exhausting all the methods, the enemy had a wild idea, using planes to carry women to carry out shameless broadcasts, distribute leaflets, and carry out live fireline shouting, saying that "United Nations" had "good food, good clothes, and good women", and that certain places had been occupied by the "United Nations"... At first, the heroes of White Cloud Mountain were so angry that they cursed and aimed at the shouters. After getting used to it, they said humorously: "Your planes and artillery are useless, how can this trick work?"
    On the night of February 5th, the heroes were ordered to move to a new position. The next day, the commanders and observers stood on the high ground of the new position and admired the Don Quixote-style attack: the planes dived down towards White Cloud Mountain like evil dogs, humming, and then floated triumphantly into the high air. Many planes circled and fired, and the sound of machine guns and bombs came in bursts. The heroes watched the show and said with a smile: "Look, look, the Americans are fighting our fortifications!" The heroes' eleven days and nights of fighting frightened the American invading army, which was strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The captured U.S. military officers and soldiers said dejectedly: "Our offensive has no hope. We can't attack during the day, and we dare not sleep at night. Climbing the mountains has caused blood blisters all over our feet, and many people don't want to do it anymore. Everyone says that retreating is better than attacking: we can sit in the car and run fast when we retreat!" (Attached picture)

　　白云山十一昼夜
    ——汉江南岸战斗纪实之五
    本报记者  林韦
    这里记载的是汉江南岸白云山地区十一昼夜阻击战中的若干英雄战斗事迹。这些战斗响亮地告诉全世界人民：胜利地打击了美国侵略者的中朝人民部队，正不断给予美国侵略者以更沉重的打击。我们是从胜利走向胜利。敌人的垂死挣扎——冒险反扑，决不能挽救他们最后的惨败。
    白云山地区南北长十公里，东西宽十五公里。东西两面紧靠水原通汉城的公路和铁路。另一公路，由水原直通白云山主峰山下。各高地间大路纵横，宽沟相通，地势极便于敌人的车辆运动。山后不远，就是汉江平川。从军事上看，这个地区并不利于防守。但因地势较高（主峰拔海达五百四十公尺），对控制左右公路铁路有重要价值，所以成为汉江南岸阻击战的一个最主要阵地。
    一月二十五日以后，以美军为首的二十多万侵略军冒险向汉江南岸反扑，声言要在七天内夺取汉江南岸中朝人民部队的全部阵地。他们用在白云山地区正面的兵力，每天平均不下三个师，五、六万人。他们以大量的飞机、大炮、坦克为步兵开路，每个士兵都带着自动火器。白云山地区的守卫者，则仅仅是人民志愿军某部只有轻武器装备的一个团，人数不及敌人二十分之一。这个团的原定任务是阻敌七天，但是，激战进行了十一昼夜，这个团仍然屹立未动。直到二月五日夜上级下令主动转移，他们才撤出来。在这里，美军二千四百多人葬送了他们可耻的生命。
            一、振奋全团的战斗序幕
    守卫白云山的英雄战斗，从主动猛袭进攻的敌人开始。第八连十八勇士袭入水原，把城南城北的敌人戳得稀烂。这是振奋全团的战斗序幕。对于本来就不高的美军士气，则是一个沉重的锤击。他们在精神上被勇士们根本压倒了。
    美军重新进入水原这个真空城市，是在一月二十五日夜，水原城内外驻扎了美军二十五师一个整营，约五百人。英雄第八连接受上级任务：由三营副营长戴汝吉率领，侦察敌情并实行袭击，打乱敌人的计划和部署。
    夜漆黑。城北大道两旁高地都有敌人。勇士们无畏地沿着大道，笔直地插向城关。美军第一道岗喝问口令，勇士们不理。二道岗继续问口令，勇士们仍不理。卡宾枪迎面打过来，勇士们腰也不弯，照常行进。左前方两挺机枪撕破夜空惊叫起来，三个同志负伤了，这一下激怒了勇士们。为首的两位猛扑上去，轰轰两声手榴弹就把两挺机枪打跑了。大家继续前进。
    在城门附近，戴汝吉随身常带的一支小小的牛角号吹起雄壮的冲锋号。敌人的自动火器和英雄们震撼大地的“冲”“杀”声一齐吼叫起来。为首的十八位勇士（几个班排干部和十来个战士），在城上城下连成一片的火光弹雨中穿进了水原城。他们和后续部队失了联系，但他们头也不回，像利刀一样在强盗们的巢穴里纵横进击。他们插到城西，又插到城南，到处寻觅敌人。
    在一个十字街上，一辆坦克正在轰隆轰隆地发动。冲在最前头的戴汝吉副营长扑上车去就打。坦克猛一开动把他摔在地上，他爬起来追上去用手榴弹猛打。坦克逃跑了，他又去追打汽车。汽车逃跑了，他们冲到一所亮着灯的大洋房院里。那里停着七辆吉普，装满枪支弹药和军用物资。判明确系美军之后，他们便用冲锋枪、手榴弹朝屋里猛打。敌人一阵阵怪叫，乱哄哄地往外跑，但却三五成堆地被冲锋枪打死在院里。三排副吴亮带着战士冲进屋内，寻找活的，被暗藏在屋角的敌人打伤了。副营长问他：“还行吗，吴亮？”回答：“行！”包扎一下伤口，马上又冲了进去。吓昏了的和躺着装死的六、七个美国兵，全部被勇士们活捉住了。
    同一时间，各处敌人从睡梦中惊醒，乱糟糟地东奔西窜，空手逃命。跑到这所大洋房附近来的，被我们封锁路口的机枪扫死在路上。
    勇士们从下午九点一直闹到午夜以后，月亮升起来了。屋内敌人一个宪兵排被全部歼灭，院里七辆吉普车被全部烧毁。时间所限，勇士们一个人背着好几支卡宾枪，押着俘虏，穿出东门，胜利而回。此时，南城美军正在向北城美军轰击，打得北城美军一阵阵尖声嚎叫。勇士们一面走，一面连声喝采“打得好！”
    东城外沿路高地也驻有美军，但他们只敢远远放枪，炮击，没有一个人敢来追打。沿路敌人的军用电线，也被勇士们割断了。
    爬过第三个山头，忽然发现对面山上有敌人的炮兵阵地。黑鸦鸦一堆人，向这边开了火。勇士们冲下山坡，在开阔地上拖着俘虏，匍匐前进。敌人的手榴弹打到三排长陈友智身边，他敏捷地抓起来回敬了敌人。
    戴汝吉二次吹起牛角号，勇士们齐声喊杀，一涌而上。敌人从山背后一溜烟跑了。山顶扔弃着八二炮、六○炮和成堆的炮弹。未挖好的工事旁边躺着洋镐洋锹。
    当美国飞机打下一串串照明弹寻找夜袭者的时候，勇士们正在自己阵地前面一个小山上吸着美国香烟，吃着美国罐头，谈论美国兵装死和逃命时的怪样子。他们发出一阵阵不能抑止的笑声。
            二、东远里七勇士
    去冬连续三次战役，把侵略军打得一泻数百里、溃不成军的时候，一个在睡袋里被俘的美军少尉不服气地对我说：“如果摆开阵线，正规地打，美军不一定会输。”他觉得美军所以败北，仅仅是由于我军使用夜战、近战和迂回包围战术，使他们的优越武器不能发挥威力。但是，东远里小树林的战斗，却使这种说法不攻自破了。
    东远里在白云山东面公路上，沿大路向西北可以直抄白云山侧背。正西经过丘陵地带，可以侧击白云山重要前卫阵地兄弟峰，并可与西面公路上光教里的敌人共同构成对白云山的包围形势。能攻能守的英雄第七连守卫在这里。东远里前面有片小树林，比平地稍高一点，是这块前哨阵地的一个小哨岗。守卫者是七连一排长韩家桢和二班班长，五个战士，共七人。
    沿公路北犯的敌人，用一个整连的兵力专门攻击这片小树林。攻击者充分地发挥了近代武器的威力。从清早开始，他们便用八架飞机和十二门大炮对小树林集中轰击了整整两小时。地面打得像开水锅一样，沸腾起蔽空的烟云。树枝树干飞起又落下，地面变成了大蜂巢。可是，敌人终于不能“打到士兵可以背着枪、吸着烟去占领阵地”（美军吹牛语）的程度。在他们的步兵接近到离勇士们五十公尺的近处时，有十八个人被一阵机步枪打倒了。其余敌人连尸首也不拖，掉头就跑。
    飞机大炮夹着坦克炮，又猛轰了半个钟头，敌人发起第二次攻击。这次他们分成正面、左面两股，由四辆坦克导引，汹涌而来。这时候，七勇士已有二人负伤。但其余五人却更沉着了。他们一直等敌人接近到三十公尺，才扔出准备好的手榴弹。轰轰几声，敌人倒下十四名，又跑了。
    这一来，敌人指挥官气疯了。六架轰炸机一齐飞来，投了大量的汽油弹和毁灭钢骨水泥建筑用的一千公斤重磅弹。阵地上一片山崩地裂的轰鸣，遍地起火，黄土变成了黑土。然后，四辆坦克单独先上，钻地一公尺的坦克炮弹一堆一堆往下打。它们爬上阵地，把残破的工事反复压过好几遍。
    这样，敌人以为这块阵地上绝对不会再有活人存在了，步兵大摇大摆往上走。但出乎意外，一阵机枪手榴弹不知从那儿打来，又把敌人揍倒八个。步兵惊得乱逃，坦克也跟着跑了。
    这时候，勇士们是在右侧较高处一个不易被发现的弹坑里隐蔽着。他们的机步枪手榴弹专门从侧面瞄准坦克后面的步兵打。他们只剩了三个人：排长韩家桢、班长崔洪成和战士高喜有。
    打退敌人第三次冲锋后，他们一面监视敌人，一面胜利的说笑着：“我们自己不退，敌人永远没有办法！”“我们不怕敌人，敌人就怕我们！”排长总结说：“美国兵的特点，第一是只要阵地上还有一声枪，他就不敢来；第二是打倒一个，别人全跑。”高喜有补充说：“瞄得准准地，一梭子就管事！”崔洪成坦述自己的心事：“我入党以后还没立过功呢，这回一定要多把敌人打死几个！”
    太阳快下山了，排长和班长站起来观察敌情。不幸被炮弹击中，重伤倒地。排长在断气时命令高喜有：“剩你一个人也要坚守，不准让敌人占这块阵地！敌人退了才回去报告！”
    一阵炮轰过去，敌人第四次冲来了。这次是坦克步兵一齐上。高喜有从弹坑里转到一个土棱背后，沉着地打出最后的几发子弹。敌人倒下两名，又逃走了。高喜有开始利用空隙，将身边的铁锹在石头上磨得快快的，准备敌人再来时劈他几个。可是，卑怯的敌人吓破了胆，再也没敢来冲锋。这一天敌人在这片小树林里被杀伤的总数是四十二名。这就是“摆开阵线正规打”的结果。（⑴⑷）
            三、争夺兄弟峰
    白云山正面前卫阵地兄弟峰的几块不大的高地，经常的守备部队不过百余人或数十人。敌人每天在狂炸狂轰之外，经常用四、五百以至一千人的兵力实行猛攻。可是，从二十六日一直打到三十一日夜，敌人始终不能达到目的。二十八日以后的四天中，敌人曾以绝对优势的兵力每天夺去一两个山头，但每次夺去的都是相同的山头。这是因为英勇的守卫者们每天夜里（有时是白天）实行猛烈反击，将敌逐回原处。敌人只好第二天从头再攻。二营副营长李盖文和六连连长郭家兴领导的一次反击，曾一直从兄弟峰插到公路上的敌人据点杜陵，歼灭美军一个营部，烧毁汽车五辆，打死敌人数十名。在杜陵背后的山头上，郭家兴带着一个通信员独自冲到六十多个敌人跟前。起初用手榴弹打，接着用驳壳枪打，以后用通信员背的步枪打。一切都打光了，他用没刺刀的枪击倒一个敌人。后来，他不幸负伤，壮烈牺牲。他一个人在这个山头上打死敌人二十多名。守卫兄弟峰的英雄们，自始至终充溢着这种无畏的进攻精神。
    兄弟峰争夺战的最后一天，一月三十一日，敌人的轰炸炮击从清早七点钟开始。密集的炮弹炸弹，把几个山头打成了一片火海。十倍于守军的美国步兵，以二十辆坦克和十多挺重机枪掩护，向兄弟峰前面的山头包围上来。敌人的冲锋，现在已经不能以次数计算。这边把敌人逼退几十公尺，敌指挥官马上逼着士兵从别处往上爬。在形势已经十分危急的时候，二营副营长李盖文在电话里回答营长：“你放心！有我李盖文在，兄弟峰丢不了！”
    守卫兄弟峰的第六连五十多位英雄，这时大部失掉了工事的依托，弹药也渐渐少了。为节省弹药，现在射击敌人的距离不是五十、四十公尺，而是三十、二十甚至五公尺了。
    中午以前，营指挥所的电话联络也断了。李盖文下令叫大家三个五个分散开，各自寻找有利的地形地物，到处打冷枪，消耗敌人，疲劳敌人，以待晚间反击。这以后，勇士们一直在石旁、树后、弹坑里和炮弹死角上顽强地坚持着。下午，敌人又增兵三百多，下决心夺取这块阵地。但一直打到天黑，还是敌人被打退了。
    六连指导员熊家兴和三个战士自然形成的一个战斗小组，坚持在山后较高处的小树下，大石背后。一个人监视着一个方向。敌人三十个、五十个、后来是一百多个从这里漫山往上爬，每一次都被四位英雄揍了下去，倒下一片。最后一次，指导员只剩几个手榴弹和驳壳枪了。他右手打手榴弹，左手装驳壳枪，然后右手打驳壳枪，左手又揭开手榴弹。终于将敌击退。直到下午三时，敌仍无可奈何。这时，英雄们所有的弹药完全打光了，便利用打退敌人的空隙在地面上寻找。正着急时，营部通讯员忽然不知从那儿钻上山来，带来八十枚手榴弹。他们用二十多枚把敌人两次新的冲锋打退以后，敌人疲惫不堪，坐在半山打起盹来。指导员此时有恃无恐，便恶作剧地拣个子弹朝敌人放一枪，骂着：“狗×的攻不动了，偏要你们攻。”敌人像疯狗一样扑上来，又被打倒一片。
    五十多个同志，就这样在近千敌人的猛攻下一直坚持到天黑，杀伤敌人三百多。阵地屹立未动。敌人退走以后，李盖文开始在各处布置哨岗，向团里请示夜里和明天的方针和任务。
            四、白云寺的英雄们
    日日夜夜战斗在悬殊的兵力和装备下，英雄们的心境多么清明，多么爽朗啊！在白云山西端侧翼阵地白云寺战斗中负伤的三营副营长戴汝吉，曾经从医院写给团首长一信，其中写道：
    “……在水原，在东远里，在白云山西端，同志们在历次战斗中表现着勇猛顽强的硬骨头劲。记着你们的号召，记着党给咱们的任务，心里亮堂堂。
    “党给咱们的教育，千万烈士给咱们精神的感召，永远不会忘记。在战斗最惨烈的时候，我们想起董存瑞（这是一九四八年承德外围隆化战斗中的爆破英雄。他左手托炸药包，右手拉导火线，轰毁高处碉堡，自己也壮烈牺牲——记者）想起入朝以来所见的惨景。我们红了眼，劲头不知那儿来的会这么大。）以下均写白云寺战斗情景——记者）陈维德（七连新任的二排长——记者）提着冲锋枪喊叫着：“狗操的你敢来！”一梭子打出去，美国少爷兵滚下去一大堆。一梭子，一梭子，少爷兵上不来。只好用炮轰，烧。陈排长，勇敢的人呀！微笑着牺牲在岗位上。陈国栋（七连三排副排长——记者）负伤不退，子弹打光打手榴弹，来回鼓励着同志们。许端平（通信班长——记者）在弹雨里火堆里来回传达上级命令，鼓励同志们发扬二班的光荣（指东远里七英雄——记者），负重伤没有叫苦。身旁手榴弹打完了，万不得已，把才发下来的反坦克炸药狠心投出去。轰声震天；雪也着火，石头也着火，少爷兵不知是什么宝贝，再也不敢接近。
    “宋指导员，无产阶级的硬骨头，伟大的共产党员。腰里横插着四个手榴弹。卡宾枪被炮打坏了，换了支冲锋枪。什么火烧不烧，子弹不子弹，跳到东又跑到西：“同志们，同鬼子拚了吧！”喊声振奋着各岗位同志们的心。敌人不分路数的向我平推，宋指导员跳过来对我喊：“首长，拚了吧！”我说：“对！就剩咱俩也要拚！注意公路！”他咬着牙，提着手榴弹走了。阵地上一阵炮轰，冒着红红的火苗，浓烟布满山头，从此再没有听到宋指导员“同鬼子拚了吧！”的响亮的声音。宋指导员可能牺牲了，宋指导员的声音和名字永远在我们的心头。（团政治机关注：“宋确实牺牲了，光荣的牺牲了！优秀的连队政治工作者，永垂不朽！”）
    “首长：我们知道任务的重要。在战斗最紧张时，使出主力向九连增援。虽然子弹打光了，阵地被炸、轰、烧，剩不几个人，同样顽强地守着岗位。不论战斗中缺点漏洞如何多，七连没有打熊（未当“狗熊”之意——记者），只有更多的经验。
    “……我的左手食指与姆指可能失去作用，现伤口正化脓。不要紧：右手还能写字，还能打手榴弹，打枪。我知道我的手是谁打的，死不了还要干，还要干得更凶。……我要争取很快回部队。”
    二月一日上午，守卫白云寺的八连几个重要干部负伤了，整个阵地的形势突趋紧张。戴汝吉扔下饭碗，左手抓了一把干米片，右手抓了一把酸菜辣椒，喊过来两挺机枪，边吃边跑，一阵风到了白云寺。他的牛角号一吹，机枪一叫，整个阵地马上稳定下来，继续顽强作战。他指挥着十几个战士，一直和数百敌军对抗到下午三时。子弹快光了，敌人攻得更急，机枪连指导员劝他离开危险地段。他说：“我不退！我得打到底！我牺牲了，只要求党追认我是共产党员就够啦！”他用最后三粒子弹打倒两个敌人，余一粒准备必要时打自己。恰巧第七连赶到，立刻反击，把他们救了出来。此后他一直战斗在最前线。直到左手重伤。
    七连指导员宋时运，三十一日指挥第七连在东远里激战一天，晚间接到紧急命令，叫七连到白云寺增援。没吃饭便行动起来。跌跌撞撞摸了整一夜，天亮时却错走到团部了。屁股没沾地，又往白云寺赶。下午三时赶到，八连正在危急。宋指导员马上率领队伍举行反击，以神速的动作一口气冲下五个山头，将敌逐退到公路上去。两天一夜没吃饭，没休息，战斗又这么紧张，他终于在第五个山头上晕倒了。抬下来没有休息，第二天这个钢铁的勇士又上了火线。
    三日，敌人的进攻达到最高潮。在数百敌人不分路数平推上来时，他抓到冲锋枪用冲锋枪打，抓到手榴弹用手榴弹打。和戴副营长商定“拚到底”的方针以后，他穿过浓密的炮火，奔到阵地前沿，公路附近，最接近敌人的地方。拣起阵亡同志的一挺轻机枪，那边危急就跑到那边打。把敌人成堆成堆地打死在山坡上。侧后敌人围上来时，他的头部已经负伤。鲜血满脸，衣服也染红了。他抱着机枪回过头，咬紧牙关猛烈射击。最后腹部胸部同时中弹，这位二十一岁优秀的连队政治工作者光荣地牺牲在自己的岗位上。他的双手一直抱着机枪，枪口笔直地指向野蛮残暴的敌人。这时，一连的英雄们赶来了，随即以勇猛的反击将数百敌人重新逐回原地，又一连两次击溃敌人的反冲锋。
            五、“美国人在和我们的工事作战呢！”
    敌人对白云山地区的进攻，开始是集中兵力攻一点，攻不动；以后改为全面猛攻，仍无效；以后又专攻一点；又全面猛攻；攻法一变再变，最后均归失败。二月初，敌人采取迂回战术，猛攻白云山背后的古分岘一带，付出数百人的代价，结果毫无进展。在白云山主峰，今天猛攻不下，明天竟日轰烧，以后又是正面攻，侧面攻，同时攻。到二月五号，白云山顶的树根轰出了土，及膝深的雪轰得没了踪影，整个地形都变了样。在一个工事正顶，能落上九发、十二发甚至二十发炮弹。但是，敌人的步兵仍然只能一堆一堆被打死在山坡上，不能到达山顶。一切办法使尽了，敌人异想天开，用飞机载了女人进行无耻的广播，散发传单，并进行地面火线喊话，说“联军”那边“好吃好穿好女人”，什么什么地方已被“联军”占领……。白云山英雄们起初气得直骂，瞄准喊话者猛打。后来看惯了，便幽默地说：“你们的飞机大炮都不管用，这套鬼把戏还能成吗？”
    二月五日夜，英雄们奉命转移到新的阵地去了。次日，指挥员和观察员们站在新阵地高头欣赏着，董吉诃德式的攻击：飞机恶狗一样哼哼着向白云山俯冲下去，又洋洋得意地浮上高空。好多飞机转圈打，机枪炸弹声一阵阵传过来。英雄们看戏似地说笑着：“你瞧你瞧，美国人在和我们的工事作战呢！”英雄们十一昼夜的战斗，把外强中干的美国侵略军吓昏了。战斗中被俘的美军官兵丧气地说：“我们的进攻没有希望。白天攻不动，晚上也不敢睡觉。爬山爬得脚上尽起血水泡，许多人都不想干了。大家都说进攻不如退却好：退却时能够坐着汽车飞快地跑呢！”（附图片）
