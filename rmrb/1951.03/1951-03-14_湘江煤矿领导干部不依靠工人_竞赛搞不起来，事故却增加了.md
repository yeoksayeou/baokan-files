To the Editor:

Our Hunan Xiangjiang Coal Mine has not launched a production competition, and the number of deaths and injuries continues to increase.

Last December, the Hunan Provincial Coal Mine Workers' Representative Conference was held in our mine. The meeting called on all coal mines to carry out production competitions. After the meeting, the mine's union and administrative leaders always emphasized objective difficulties and never started the competition. It was not until the Central South Industrial Department instructed us to make the development of competition the central task that the administrative leaders of our factory began to propose to carry out the competition. However, how to carry out the competition was never discussed with the workers; only a few administrative leaders wrote a plan and reported it to the higher authorities.

The plan originally stipulated that the competition would start in the Well No. 2 section on February 16 this year. February 16 arrived, but the competition did not start. That night, the union held a meeting, and union member Gu Junrui only briefly mentioned the competition. Huang Xiaolin, the director of the Well No. 2 section workshop, felt that the competition was difficult and asked everyone for help. Only then did someone remember that there was an "patriotic production competition propaganda and mobilization committee"? The next day, the union found the roster of this organization, but several of the organization's leaders were away on business, and their work had not been handed over.

The cooperation of all parties in the development of the competition was also insufficient. The clerical section wrote dozens of slogans. A sign was posted in the woodworking yard saying, "Do not wear oily shoes and wooden clogs down the well." The rest of the slogans were also "Do not do this" and "Do not do that." How can such orders improve the production mood of the workers? The blackboard newspaper did not mention the competition either. On the February 18th blackboard newspaper, what was published was the confession of a gambling worker.

Obviously, the competition in our mine has neither organization nor leadership. The union and the administration do not pay enough attention to the competition, and it has been dragged on until now, and the competition has not yet been launched.

The competition has not been successful, but accidents have increased!

From August last year to the end of January this year, although no liability accidents occurred during this stage, minor injuries gradually increased. The reason is that wages have increased, and workers only want to dig more coal, and there has not been good safety education for workers. The first thing workers do when they go down the well used to be "knocking on the roof to check for safety," but now it has become picking up a pickaxe and hacking hard, "asking if their luck is good today"? If the pickaxe hits a soft coal seam, they are "overjoyed"; if it is hard coal, they shout bad luck. This way, only focusing on digging coal and not paying attention to safety, accidents are of course easy to occur. On February 3, worker Guo Yunsheng was working halfway down the dark shaft of the sixth lower well. Another worker above was hanging wooden planks down. One of the wooden planks was not tied tightly and fell down, hitting Guo Yunsheng on the head. Guo Yunsheng fell into the water in the well, was injured, and died. Upon inspection, many people were involved in the accident, and some people even wanted to report it as "falling to death" in an attempt to evade responsibility. Afterwards, the lessons learned from this accident and how to prevent it in the future were not explained to the masses.

It was not until March that a report was written on the accident, along with preliminary disciplinary opinions, and reported to the higher authorities.

### 湘江煤矿领导干部不依靠工人  竞赛搞不起来，事故却增加了

    湘江煤矿领导干部不依靠工人
    竞赛搞不起来，事故却增加了编辑同志：
    我们湖南湘江煤矿一直未发动起生产竞赛，而死伤事故却不断增加。
    去年十二月，湖南全省煤矿职工代表会议在我矿召开。会议曾号召各煤矿开展生产竞赛。会后，我矿工会和行政领导干部总是强调客观困难，一直没有搞。直到中南工业部指示以开展竞赛为中心工作时，我厂行政领导上才开始提出要开展竞赛。但是竞赛如何搞，根本未发动工人讨论，只是由少数行政领导干部写了计划，报告上级。
    计划原定今年二月十六日以井二段开始竞赛。二月十六日到了，竞赛并没有开始。当天晚上工会开会，工会委员谷钧瑞仅略提了提竞赛的事。井二段车间主任黄孝麟觉得竞赛很难，向大家求援，这才有人想起说：“不是早有爱国主义生产竞赛宣传鼓动委员会”吗？第二天，工会才找出这个组织的名册，但这个组织的几位负责人却出差去了，他们的工作也没有交代下来。
    开展竞赛中各方面的配合也很不够。文书股写了几十条标语。在木工场院子里贴了一张“不要穿着油鞋木屐下井”。其余的标语也是“不要这”“不要那”的。这样一条条的命令，怎么能提高工人的生产情绪？黑板报也不提竞赛的事，在二月十八日的黑板报上，登的却是赌博工人的悔过书。
    很明显，我矿的竞赛既无组织，也没有人领导。工会和行政对竞赛不够重视，一直拖到现在，竞赛还未发动起来。
    竞赛没有搞好，事故却增加了！
    去年八月到今年元月底，这一阶段虽未发生责任事故，但轻伤事故却逐渐增加。原因是工资增加了，工人只想多挖煤，没有很好地向工人进行安全教育。工人下井第一件事，原为“敲梆问顶”以测安全；但却变成了拿起镐锹狠狠一下，“问问今天运气好不好”？一镐下去是软煤层，便“欢天喜地”；若是硬煤，便喊倒霉。这样只顾挖煤，不管安全，当然容易造成事故。二月三日，工人郭云生正在六下井暗井半腰工作。上面另一工人吊着木板往下放。有一块木板没有绑牢，掉下来正打在郭云生头上。郭云生落到井下水中，受伤身死。检讨起来，这事故牵连人很多，当时还有些人想报“跌毙”，企图推卸责任。事后，对这次事故的经验教训以及今后如何防止等，也未向群众说明。
    直到三月份，才将事故经过写出报告，连同初步处分意见报告了上级。
