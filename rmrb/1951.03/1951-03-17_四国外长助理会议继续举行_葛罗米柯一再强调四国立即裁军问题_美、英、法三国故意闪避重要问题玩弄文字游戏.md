　　Fourth Assistant Foreign Ministers Conference Continues
	Gromyko Repeatedly Emphasizes the Issue of Immediate Disarmament by the Four Powers
	The United States, Britain, and France Deliberately Evade Important Issues and Engage in Word Games

	Twelve Day Meeting

	[Xinhua News Agency, March 14th] (TASS, Paris, March 13th) - The Fourth Assistant Foreign Ministers Conference held its seventh meeting on the 12th, chaired by Soviet representative Gromyko.

	Gromyko spoke first, stating that the Soviet delegation believed that the wording of the second item in its proposal was correct. However, understanding that the wording of the second item in the Soviet proposal was difficult to obtain unanimous agreement from the participating countries, the Soviet representative was willing to modify the wording of the second item to "Re-establishing the unity of Germany and concluding a peace treaty with Germany." Gromyko emphasized that the new wording of the second item in the Soviet proposal corresponded in content to the third item in the Three Powers' proposal. Therefore, he hoped that the representatives of the Three Powers would agree to the new wording of the second item in the Soviet proposal.

	Gromyko also expressed disagreement with the new wording of the first item in the Three Powers' proposal, as put forward by the Western Three Powers' delegations at the last meeting. The original text of this new wording was as follows: "To examine the causes of the current tense international situation in Europe, to examine methods that can ensure a genuine and lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France, such as: taking measures aimed at eliminating the fear of aggression, fulfilling obligations arising from already concluded treaties, studying the current level of armaments, and various issues related to Germany in this regard." Gromyko pointed out that the new wording of the first item in the Western proposal was the same as the original wording. Its intention was nothing more than to replace the Soviet Union's two important proposals regarding the elimination of German militarism and preventing Germany from re-militarizing, and regarding the reduction of the four countries' armies. The new wording made no mention at all of eliminating German militarism and preventing Germany from re-militarizing, but merely replaced it with vague wording about "the level of armaments."

	After Gromyko's speech, American representative Jessup, French representative Barioh, and British representative Davies spoke successively, saying that they reserved the right to speak on the new wording of the second item in the Soviet proposal. They all still insisted on passing the new wording of the first item in the Three Powers' proposal.

	The next meeting was scheduled for the 13th.

  Thirteen Day Meeting

	[Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] (TASS, Paris, March 14th) - The Fourth Assistant Foreign Ministers Conference continued its work on March 13th, chaired by American representative Jessup.

	The representatives of the Western Three Powers did not express a clear attitude at the meeting towards the modified wording of the second item of the Soviet proposal. As is well known, in order to reach an agreement at the meeting, the Soviet Union had already modified the original wording of the second item of its proposal at the meeting on the 12th, "On the issue of accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany in accordance with this treaty," to "Establishing the unity of Germany and concluding a peace treaty with Germany." This new wording was identical in content to the third item of the Western proposal. French representative Barioh admitted that this new wording was a considerable improvement, but he tried to emphasize that the new wording of the second item of the Soviet proposal was different from the third item of the Three Powers' proposal. He said: The Soviet proposal speaks of the issue of concluding a peace treaty, while the third item in the Western countries' proposal only speaks of preparing a peace treaty with Germany.

	At the meeting, the representatives of the Western Three Powers all tried to defend the new wording of the first item of the proposal put forward by the Three Powers at the meeting on the 10th. This wording had already been proven by Gromyko to be used to replace the Soviet proposal on eliminating German militarism and preventing Germany from re-militarizing and on reducing the four countries' armies. At the meeting, Barioh strongly argued that the proposal on eliminating German militarism and preventing Germany from re-militarizing was "too cumbersome" to write in French.

	When British representative Davies spoke, he attempted to portray the situation as if the Soviet delegation wanted to isolate the German issue from other issues for discussion.

	Gromyko spoke, pointing out that the representatives of the Western countries still had not clearly expressed their attitude towards the new wording of the second item of the Soviet proposal today. Regarding Barioh's statement that the new wording of the second item of the Soviet proposal was different from the wording of the third item of the Western proposal, Gromyko pointed out that in fact the Soviet wording was more correct, because the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany must first have the preparatory work for this action, while preparing a peace treaty with Germany did not necessarily predetermine that a treaty must be concluded. In mentioning Barioh's statement that the French wording on eliminating German militarism was "too cumbersome," Gromyko said: "I have a higher appreciation for the French language - the language of Rousseau, Voltaire, and Robespierre - and I am sure that any thought that can be expressed in Russian can also be expressed in French." Gromyko also refuted Davies' statement that the Soviet proposal attempted to isolate the German issue from other issues for discussion. He pointed out that the Soviet proposal's inclusion of the proposals for reducing the four countries' armies and eliminating German militarism on the same agenda itself proved that the Soviet delegation had absolutely no intention of separating the German issue from other issues for discussion.

	American representative Jessup said that it might not be difficult to reach an agreement on the second item of the Soviet proposal, but he immediately said that whether a final agreement could be reached on this item should depend on whether an agreement could be reached on the other items on the agenda.

	The next meeting was held on the 14th.

	Fourteen Day Meeting

	[Xinhua News Agency, March 16th] (TASS, Paris, March 15th) - The Fourth Assistant Foreign Ministers Conference continued on the 14th, chaired by French representative Barioh.

	As in the past, the representatives of the Western Three Powers repeated almost verbatim the same unconvincing arguments to support their proposed agenda. Barioh said in his speech that it was impossible to continue the discussion in this way. He said: "Our discussion has reached a stage where our methods have been completely exhausted." He said that he intended to conduct the discussion using "more specific methods."

	When Soviet representative Gromyko spoke about Barioh's proposal to include the first item of the Three Powers' proposal, which mentioned the causes of the current tense situation in Europe in very general terms, on the agenda, he said: The Soviet delegation believes that the issues of eliminating German militarism and reducing the four countries' armies are the most important issues, so it insists on including these issues as separate and independent proposals on the agenda, and should not be submerged in wording full of meaningless rhetoric and word games.

	Gromyko said: After considering the objections of the Three Powers' representatives to the original wording of the first item of the Soviet proposal, the Soviet delegation has decided to revise it. The original wording of this item was: "On the issue of the four countries fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and preventing Germany from re-militarizing." The new wording now reads: "On the issue of the four countries fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism." Gromyko expressed hope that this new wording would be accepted by the Three Powers.

	Gromyko then said: The Soviet delegation has repeatedly emphasized that it advocates that the four foreign ministers should discuss the issue of the four countries immediately reducing their armies as a separate and independent item, which is fully justified. However, the representatives of the Western Three Powers opposed the Soviet Union's proposal. Gromyko said: Since it is now impossible to reach an agreement on this item using the previous wording, the Soviet delegation agreed to put forward the following new proposal, which was drafted based on the original wording of the first item of the Three Powers' proposal and the third item of the Soviet proposal. The new wording of this item is as follows: "To examine the causes of the current tense international situation in Europe and to study the measures necessary to achieve a genuine and lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France, including the issue of reducing the armies of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France." Gromyko said: The Soviet delegation hopes that this item can now be accepted by the representatives of the Three Powers.

	Gromyko then talked about the second item in the Soviet proposal regarding the unification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, saying: Although the Soviet delegation believes that the objections to the original wording of the Soviet proposal are unfounded, it has already made a half concession on the 12th to respond to the wishes of the Three Powers' delegations, agreeing to delete two provisions from this item that the representatives of the Three Powers could not accept, namely the provisions regarding accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing the occupying forces. However, the representatives of the United States, France, and Britain still did not affirmatively express their willingness to accept this wording. In order to make it easier to reach an agreement on this item, the Soviet delegation expressed its willingness to accept the item proposed by the Three Powers' delegations, namely: "On the issue of restoring German unity and preparing a peace treaty."

	Gromyko said: In this way, our conference has obtained the first item on the agenda, which has been agreed upon and accepted by the four delegations, and we hope that this will promote the achievement of an agreement on the other items on the agenda as well.

	Gromyko also said: As for the order of the various items proposed by the Soviet Union in the new wording on the agenda, it should be discussed further. The Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to remind the assistant foreign ministers' meeting that the issue of fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism should be considered as the first item.

	The representatives of the Western Three Powers stated that they reserved the right to speak later on the substance of the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the meeting on the 14th.

	The next meeting was scheduled for March 15th.

　　四国外长助理会议继续举行
    葛罗米柯一再强调四国立即裁军问题
    美、英、法三国故意闪避重要问题玩弄文字游戏
    十二日会议
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：四国外长助理会议于十二日举行第七次会议，由苏联代表葛罗米柯担任主席。
    葛罗米柯首先发言称：苏联代表团认为，它的建议中第二项措辞是正确的，但由于了解到苏联建议的第二项的措辞难于获得参加会议各国的一致同意，因此，苏联代表愿意修改第二项的措辞为《重新建立德国的统一，缔结对德和约》。葛罗米柯着重指出，苏联建议中第二项的新措辞，在内容上与三国建议的第三项相吻合。因此，他希望三国代表会同意苏联建议中第二项的新措辞。
    葛罗米柯又表示不同意上次会议中西方三国代表团所提出的三国建议第一项的新措辞。这项新措辞的原文如下：“审议目前在欧洲存在的国际局势紧张的原因，审议能够保证苏联与美、英、法之间的关系真正而持久地改善的方法，例如：采取旨在消灭对侵略的恐惧的措施，履行因已缔结的条约而产生的义务，研究目前的军备水平和在这方面与德国有关的各种问题。”葛罗米柯指出，西方建议第一项的新措辞与原来的措辞一样。其用意无非是用来代替苏联关于肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化和关于裁减四国军队的两项重要建议。新措辞完全没有谈到肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化的问题，而仅仅代之以关于“军备水平”的含糊的措辞。
    葛罗米柯发言后，美国代表耶塞普、法国代表巴罗第、英国代表戴维斯相继发言，他们说，他们保留就苏联建议第二项新措辞发言的权利。他们都仍坚持通过三国建议第一项的新措辞。
    下次会议定于十三日举行。
  十三日会议
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：四国外长助理会议三月十三日继续工作，由美国代表耶塞普任主席。
    西方三国代表在会议上对修改后的苏联建议第二项的措辞没有表示明确的态度。如所周知，为了能在会议上取得协议，苏联已在十二日会议上将其建议第二项原来的措辞《关于加速缔结对德和约以及按照这个和约从德国撤退占领军的问题》修改为《建立德国的统一，缔结对德和约》。这种新措辞在内容上是与西方建议的第三项相同的。法国代表巴罗第承认，这种新措辞是一个相当大的改进，但是，他力图强调苏联建议第二项的新措辞与三国建议第三项不同。他说：苏联建议说的是缔结和约问题，而西方国家建议中的第三项却只说到准备对德和约问题。
    西方三国代表在会议上，都力图为三国在十日会议上提出的建议第一项的新措辞辩护。这个措辞已为葛罗米柯证明了，是用来代替苏联所提关于肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化和裁减四国军队的建议的。巴罗第在会上强辩说：关于肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化的建议用法文来写是“太累赘”了。
    英国代表戴维斯发言时，企图把事情说成是苏联代表团要把德国问题与其他问题孤立开来讨论。
    葛罗米柯发言指出，西方国家代表今天仍未明确表示他们对苏联建议第二项新措辞的态度。对于巴罗第所说苏联建议第二项新措辞与西方建议第三项措辞不同一点，葛罗米柯指出，事实上是苏联的措辞更为正确，因为缔结对德和约必须先有这个行动的准备工作，而准备对德和约却未必预定和约一定缔结。在提到巴罗第所谓法文关于肃清德国军国主义的措辞“太累赘”的说法时，葛罗米柯说：“我对于法文——卢梭、伏尔泰和罗伯斯比尔的文字——有一种更高的评价，我确信任何能以俄文表达出来的思想也能以法文表达出来。”葛罗米柯并且驳斥了戴维斯关于苏联建议力图把德国问题与其他问题孤立起来讨论的说法。他指出，苏联建议在同一议程中，同时列入裁减四国军队和肃清德国军国主义的议案本身就证明了苏联代表团绝没有企图把德国问题与其他问题分开来讨论。
    美国代表耶塞普说，就苏联建议第二项取得协议也许是不困难的，但是，他马上又说，对于这一项议案能否取得最后协议，应视是否能就议程上其他诸项议案取得协议而定。
    下次会议于十四日举行。
  十四日会议
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：四国外长助理会议在十四日继续举行，由法国代表巴罗第任主席。
    和过去一样，西方三国代表在会上差不多一字不变地又把那同一种不能令人信服的论据重复了一遍，来支持他们所提出的议程建议。巴罗第发言说，再这样继续讨论下去是不成了。他说：“我们的讨论已经到了我们的办法已经完全用尽了的阶段”。他说，他打算用“较为具体的方法”进行讨论。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在谈到巴罗第提出要把极笼统地提到欧洲目前紧张局势之原因的三国建议第一项议案列入议程时说：苏联代表团认为肃清德国军国主义的问题和裁减四国军队的问题，是最重要的问题，所以坚持要把这些问题作为单独的与独立的议案列入议程，而不应被淹没在充满无意义的辞藻与文字游戏的措辞里。
    葛罗米柯说：苏联代表团在考虑了三国代表对苏联建议的第一项议案原措词的反对意见后，已决定予以修正。这一项议案的原措词是：《关于四国履行肃清德国军国主义并不准德国重新军国主义化的波茨坦协定的问题》。现在的新措词改为：《关于四国履行肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定问题》。葛罗米柯表示希望这样的新措词能为三国所接受。
    葛罗米柯然后说：苏联代表团曾一再强调指出它主张四外长把四国立即进行裁减军队的问题当作单独的独立的一项议案来讨论是有充分根据的。但是西方三国代表反对苏联的这个建议。葛罗米柯说：由于现在不可能在这一项议案上用以前的措辞来达成协议，苏联代表团同意提出下列新建议，它是根据三国建议中第一项议案的原措辞和苏联建议中的第三项议案来起草的。这一项议案新的措辞如下：“审议欧洲现存国际紧张局势的原因并研究为达到苏联和美、英、法间的关系之真正持久改善所必需的措施，其中包括裁减苏、美、英、法四国的军队的问题。”葛罗米柯说：苏联代表团希望，这一项议案现在能为三国代表所接受。
    葛罗米柯接着谈到苏联建议中关于德国统一与缔结对德和约问题的第二项议案说：苏联代表团虽然认为对于苏联建议原措辞的反对意见是没有根据的，然而已在十二日作了一半的让步以应三国代表团的希望，同意在这一项中删去三国代表所不能接受的两个规定，即关于加速缔结对德和约与关于撤退占领军的规定。但是，美、法、英的代表们仍没有肯定地表示他们愿意接受这个措辞。为了要这项议案易于取得协议，苏联代表团表示愿意接受三国代表团提出的议案，即：《关于恢复德国统一与准备和约的问题》。
    葛罗米柯说：这样，我们会议已经得到了议程上第一个议案，这个议案业经四国代表团议定并加以接受，我们希望这将促成就议程其他议案也获致协议。
    葛罗米柯并说：至于苏联以新措辞提出的各项议案在议程中的先后次序问题，应该再加以讨论。苏联代表团认为必须提醒外长助理会议：关于履行肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定的问题，应该作为第一个议案来审议。
    西方三国代表们声明，对于苏联在十四日会议上提出的建议的实质，他们保留以后发言的权利。
    下次会议定于三月十五日举行。
