Heroic Vietnamese Women in Battle
A Fourth Glimpse of Northern Vietnam
By Our Special Correspondent Meng Qing

The very first day I set foot on Vietnamese soil, I heard people talking about this incident: in central Vietnam, French troops forced many Vietnamese women to hold their children and stand on a bridge, facing the river. Then, they ordered them to throw their innocent children into the river, and those who hesitated even slightly were immediately shot dead by the French troops.

During my trip north, I also heard many stories about the French colonialists' insults and brutal treatment of Vietnamese women. The extent of their barbaric behavior is unimaginable to ordinary people. However, during this trip, I saw and heard many facts about Vietnamese women waging a tenacious struggle against such brutal enemies.

In the rural areas of the Vietnamese liberated zones, there are generally very few young men. In a small village near Guangyuan, the entire village had more than 300 people, but apart from a few old men and a dozen children, the rest were all women. Where had the men gone? The French puppet invading troops had come here the year before, massacred a group of Viet Minh cadres and young people actively participating in the anti-French struggle, and abducted a group of strong men when they retreated. After the enemy left, the remaining young men, burning with the flames of revenge, all joined the army.

In this village, ravaged by the enemy, most of the houses were burned down, and there was no food. The women, with tears and sweat, plowed the soil and sowed the grain seeds loaned by the government. Every day, they also had to take their children up the mountains to pick wild fruits and bring them back to feed the weak old people in their homes. They barely managed to survive the months of hardship before the harvest, and only then did they begin to repair their houses. Now, when I visited this small village, the fields were once again golden yellow; chicks were chasing each other, and flocks of ducks were swimming in the pond. People were busy going to the mountains to gather firewood for the army; groups of young girls crowded at the village entrance, enthusiastically cheering the passing People's Army troops.

I once stayed with comrades of the Vietnamese People's Army in a small village near Bac Kan. The village Women's National Salvation Association mobilized the masses to send many melons and fruits and also sent representatives to慰问 the troops. One of the representatives was a girl around twenty years old, the captain of the village militia. In the autumn of 1947, on the second day after her wedding, French paratroopers suddenly landed in Bac Kan, and the newly married couple was separated. The man, along with many militiamen from the village, cooperated with the People's Army to resist the enemy, but were later forced to retreat, and no one knew where they had gone. After a period of crying and frustration, she realized that the sooner the French colonialists were defeated, the sooner her man would return. Therefore, this girl joined the village militia, performed meritorious deeds, and was elected as the captain.

All of the patriotic activities of Vietnamese women are inseparable from the glorious name of the Women's National Salvation Association. It is a component of the Vietnam Independence League—the national united front of the Vietnamese people—and was founded in May 1941. Now, this organization has more than 2.7 million members, and the masses of women participating in patriotic activities under their education and promotion are spread all over the country. They organized collective land reclamation, increasing the planting of 50,000 mu of rice and miscellaneous grains. They raised more than 500,000 cattle, pigs, and other livestock. On the front lines and in the enemy's rear base areas, there are female guerrillas participating in combat everywhere. A twenty-year-old female guerrilla in Quang Tri Province in central Vietnam participated in thirty attacks on enemy strongholds; a female guerrilla in southern Vietnam was promoted step by step from soldier to small detachment leader (battalion commander). Now, she is commanding battle after battle that makes the enemy lose their minds and hearts. On Highway 4, 200,000 women transported food and ammunition to the troops for half a month without stopping. Currently, in the rear, women have replaced most of the work of men and are trying everything possible to support the front lines, allowing their husbands, brothers, and sons to kill the enemy with peace of mind.

When I was on the Northeast front, along the way, more than 80% of the laborers I saw were women. All were barefoot, carrying a load on their shoulders, walking nimbly on the stony roads, talking to each other, and constantly letting out hearty laughter. It was these people who built hundreds of kilometers of rugged mountain roads leading to the front lines. Some of them lived nearby, some came from the plains of the Red River Delta, and some came from the remote Northwest region. Tens of thousands of working women entrusted their children to the elderly in their homes, and for one or two months, they traveled through sparsely populated, endless mountain wilderness, eating rice balls or glutinous rice dumplings they carried with them, and sleeping in the shade of trees or the dense thatch grass by the roadside. One day, we set off at four o'clock in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw piles of dark masses on the ridges of the fields beside the road. I shone a flashlight on them, and they turned out to be laborers sleeping in the open. They were leaning closely against each other, relying on the body temperature of their companions to keep warm. Thinking of the torrential rain last night, I couldn't help but feel sad. How many new and old hatreds have taken root in these people's hearts, turning into a source of strength for them to endure all hardships and persevere in the struggle against the irreconcilable French invaders.

Some female laborers, with a string of large silver rings around their necks and a triangular collar on their upper garments, revealing their chests, with two rows of red brocade balls arranged symmetrically in front of their chests, were particularly eye-catching. They were a minority ethnic group from the high mountains of northern Vietnam—the Man people. From some unknown time in their ancestors' past, they had warned each other generation after generation: "Don't go down the mountain, the frogs down the mountain are a kind of monster, and listening to the monster's croaking will make people sick." Therefore, people climbed to the highest mountain peaks and built small thatched huts to live in. They had no bedding, and all year round, a pile of fire burned in their homes. When women gave birth, they slept next to this pile of fire. They did not easily go down the mountain, and only a few people carried some grain to the nearby market several times a year to exchange for salt. During World War II, Viet Minh cadres engaged in secret activities to drive out the Japanese and French invaders sowed the seeds of revolution in those high mountains. Now, many Man women have come down the mountain to participate in the war of resistance. They, like their sisters from other ethnic groups in Vietnam—the Kinh, Tho, Nong…—sleep on the side of the road every night, and countless frogs croak beside them.

Many female leaders of labor teams are outstanding working women. One, called Second Sister, had skin that was charred black, covered in a layer of sweat, making it even darker and shinier, and her voice was very loud. She was always busy running back and forth, working tirelessly all day long, assigning tasks to everyone, arranging for the team members to eat and rest, and constantly thinking of ways to solve the many difficulties in the work.

On the night when the Vietnamese People's Army attacked Dongxi in September last year, it was already past ten o'clock, and Second Sister was preparing to lie down and rest when suddenly, a messenger delivered another note: "Urgent! Shells must be delivered to the Dongxi front line before three o'clock tomorrow morning." She jumped up, went over, looked at the little sisters who were sleeping soundly, hesitated for a moment, but she still shouted in a shrill voice: "Assembly! There is an urgent task, everyone get up quickly." Half an hour later, Second Sister stood in front of the assembled laborers, telling them the order she had just received; then, in a tone like a mother cherishing her children, she asked:

"Sisters, we haven't rested for two days and one night in a row. Tonight, we have to send bullets to the front line. What do you all think?"

The noisy voices quieted down, and someone in the crowd replied:

"We are not tired!"

"Not tired!"

"Not tired!"

……………

Thus, more than a hundred figures carrying boxes of bullets moved forward silently in the darkness. On the road, there was only the rustling of footsteps and Second Sister's constant urging: "Hurry up, take bigger steps, time is running out." They climbed over rocky mountains, crossed jungles and muddy rice paddies, and finally reached their destination.

Second Sister told everyone to hide behind the hillside and went alone to find the person in charge of the troops. After a while, she ran back breathlessly and told everyone that the shells were there and someone would come to collect them soon. Now, their new task was to go to the front to carry the wounded. Second Sister loudly encouraged everyone:

"Sisters, how many brothers are lying bleeding in front of us waiting for us. Today, no matter how tired we are, we must persevere, and we can rest well tonight."

After saying that, she took the lead and ran, followed by a long line of figures. It was almost dawn, and they ran to a hillside, saw that it was steep and slippery below, Second Sister stopped, and suddenly thought that if the planes came after dawn, it would be troublesome. Therefore, she sat down without hesitation, stretched her feet forward, supported herself with her hands behind her, pushed hard, and shouted, "Follow me!" Her body slid down the slope, and in the blink of an eye, she reached the foot of the mountain. Looking back, the first one, the second one… all followed and slid down. Second Sister stood up with peace of mind and ran forward again. The sound of bullets was very close, and one or two stray bullets whizzed over her head. She instinctively bent down, and everyone bent down and followed behind her.

The smoky Dongxi barracks appeared in front of her. Many laborers, carrying food baskets, carrying bullets, and carrying wounded soldiers on their backs, were busy running back and forth. Second Sister and her group of sisters also went up to meet them, taking those who climbed down by themselves and those seriously wounded who were rescued from the front line by their comrades.

That afternoon, in a mountain gully behind, more than a hundred female laborers returned from the front line, and fell asleep as soon as they lay down, with many people's clothes still stained with bloodstains.

Thousands upon thousands of Vietnamese women, just like these female laborers, are firmly standing at the forefront of the struggle, bravely fighting to completely drive out the French invaders.

　　英勇战斗着的越南妇女
    越北见闻之四
    本报特约记者  孟青
    当我刚踏进越南国境的第一天，就听到人们谈起这样的事：在中部，法军强迫许多越南妇女，抱着自己的孩子，站在桥上，面对着河，然后下令要她们将那些无辜的孩子扔下河去，稍为迟疑的，立即被法军开枪打死。
    在北行途中，我还听到许多关于法国殖民者侮辱和摧残越南妇女的事，那些兽行的残暴程度，不是一般人所能想像得出的。然而，就在这次旅行当中，我看见了也听到了许多越南妇女对着这样残暴的敌人进行坚韧斗争的事实。
    越南解放区的农村中，青年男子一般都很少。在广渊附近的一个小村庄，全村共有三百多人，除了几个老汉和十多个小孩子之外，其余都是妇女。男人都到那里去了呢？前年法伪侵略军队曾到过这里，屠杀了一批越盟干部和积极参加抗法斗争的年青人，撤退时还掳去一批壮丁。敌人走后，剩下的那些青年男子，被复仇的火焰燃烧着，都参军去了。
    这个经过敌人蹂躏以后的村庄，房屋多被烧毁了，粮食也没有了。妇女们一把眼泪一把汗，翻耕着泥土，播下了政府贷放的谷种。每天还必须和孩子们上山去采摘野果，带回来给家中衰弱的老年人吃，好容易才挨过了青黄不接的几个月，等到割完第一季稻子之后，才动手修葺房子。现在，当我访问这个小村庄的时候，田野里已经又是一片金黄色；鸡雏在互相追逐，鸭子成群地在池塘里游来游去。人们忙着到山上给军队打柴；少女们成群结队拥在村口，向过路的人民军队伍热烈欢呼。
    我曾和越南人民军同志借宿在北?附近的一个小村子，村妇女救国会发动群众送来了许多瓜果，还推派代表慰问部队。代表中有一个二十岁左右的女孩子，是本村游击队的中队长。一九四七年秋，当她结婚后的第二天，法军伞兵部队突然在北?降落，这一对新婚夫妇就被冲散了。男的和本村的许多游击队员，配合人民军抵抗敌人，后来被迫撤退，不知到那里去了。她经过一段哭泣和懊丧的日子以后，认识到早一天打垮法国殖民主义者，她的男人就会早一天回来。于是，这个女孩子参加了本村的游击队，立下战功，被选为中队长。
    越南妇女的一切爱国活动，和妇女救国会这个光辉的名字分不开。它是越南独立同盟——越南人民的民族统一战线的一个组成部分，成立于一九四一年五月。现在，这个团体已经拥有二百七十多万会员，在她们的教育和推动下参加爱国活动的妇女群众，遍布于全国的每一个角落。她们组织集体开荒，增植了五万亩稻米和杂粮。她们饲养了五十多万头牛、猪和别的家畜。在前线和敌后根据地，到处有女游击队参加作战。中部广治省的一个二十岁的女游击队员，参加了三十次对敌据点的袭击；南部有一个女游击队员，从战士一步步地被提升到小团长（营长），现在，她正指挥着一次又一次使敌人丧心寒胆的战斗。在第四号公路上，二十万妇女曾半个月不停地给部队运送粮食弹药。目前在后方，妇女们代替了男性的大部分工作，并且想尽一切办法支援前线，让她们的丈夫、兄弟和儿子安心杀敌。
    当我在东北前线的时候，一路上，我所见到的民工，百分之八十以上是女性。全都光着脚板，肩上挑一付担子，在石头子路上矫健地行走，互相交谈着，时时发出爽朗的笑声。就是这些人，动手修筑了通到前线去的几百公里崎岖的山路。她们有的就住家在附近，有的来自红河三角洲平原地带，还有来自遥远的西北地区。成千成万的劳动妇女，把孩子交给家中的老年人，一个月两个月地，走过人烟稀少、连绵不尽的山野丛林，吃着自己随身携带的饭团或粽子，露宿在道旁的树荫底下或山边茂密的茅草丛里。有一天，早上四点钟我们就动身赶路，天还黑，看见路旁田埂上一堆堆黑压压的东西，我用手电一照，原来都是露宿的民工，她们紧紧地互相倚偎着，靠同伴们的体温来取暖。想起昨夜的倾盆大雨，我不禁难过起来。多少新仇旧恨在这些人的心上扎下了根，变成了她们忍受一切艰难困苦、坚持和那不共戴天的法国侵略者进行斗争的力量的泉源。
    有些女民工，颈上套着一串大银环，上身的短袄开个三角领，胸部坦露着，襟前对称地排着两列红色锦球，特别引人注目。那是越北高山上的一种少数民族——曼族。从她们的祖先不知什么时候起，一代又一代地互相告诫着：“不要到山下去，山下的青蛙是一种妖怪，听了妖怪的叫声会使人生病的。”因此，人们都爬到最高的山顶上，搭起小茅屋来居住。他们没有被褥，常年四季家中烧着一堆火，女人生育的时候，就睡在这火堆旁边。他们不轻易下山，只有少数人每年几次背些粮食到附近市场去换盐巴。第二次世界大战期间，为驱逐日本和法国侵略者而从事秘密活动的越盟干部，就在那些高山上播下了革命的种子。现在，许多曼族妇女都下山来参加抗战工作了。她们也和越南其他各种民族——京族、土族、侬族……的姐妹们一样，每晚露宿在公路边，多少青蛙就在她们身旁呱呱地叫着。
    许多民工团的女领队，都是出色的劳动妇女。有一个叫做二姐的，皮肤焦黑，蒙上一层汗，更加黑得发亮，她的嗓子非常响亮。她总是忙碌地来回奔跑，不知疲劳地整天工作着，给大家分配任务，安顿队员们吃饭和休息，还要不断地想法子解决工作中的许多困难。
    当去年九月间越南人民军进攻东溪的那天晚上，已经十点多钟了，二姐正准备躺下休息，忽然，通讯员又送来一张条子：“急！炮弹限明晨三时前送到东溪前线。”她跳起来，过去看了看几个睡得正酣的小姐妹，心里踌躇了一下，但她还是尖着嗓子喊着：“集合！有紧急任务，大家快起来。”半小时后，二姐站在集合起来的民工们前面，告诉她们那刚刚接到的命令；接着，她用一种像母亲痛惜孩子似的声调询问：
    “姐妹们，已经接连两天一夜没有休息了，今晚又要送子弹到前线去，大家觉得怎样？”
    嘈杂的人声静下了，群众中有人回答：
    “我们不累！”
    “不累！”
    “不累！”
    ……………
    于是，一百多个挑着子弹箱的人影，在黑暗中默默地前进。公路上只有沙沙的脚步声和二姐不断的催促声：“快点，步子迈大一点，时间要到了。”她们爬过了石山，穿越过丛林和泥泞的水田，终于到达了目的地。
    二姐吩咐大家在山坡后隐蔽起来，自己一个人找部队的负责人去。一会儿，她喘着气跑回来，告诉大家说，炮弹就放在那里，马上就有人来收。现在，她们的新任务是到前面去抬伤员。二姐高声地鼓励大家说：
    “姐妹们，多少弟兄正流着血躺在前面等待我们，今天，不管怎样疲劳，我们都得坚持下去，晚上再好好休息。”
    说完了，她带头就跑，一列长长的人影跟在后面。天快亮了，她们跑到一个山坡，看看下面又陡又滑，二姐停住了脚，心里忽然想起，天亮后飞机一来就麻烦了。于是，她毫不迟疑地坐下，两脚往前伸直，双手支在后面，用力一撑，口里喊：“跟我来！”身子顺着斜坡往下滑，转眼就到了山脚，回头一看，第一个，第二个……都跟着滑下来了。二姐安心地站起，又往前跑，子弹声已经很近，一两粒流弹在头顶上呼呼地掠过，她本能地弯下腰，大家也都弯着腰，跟在后面。
    烟火迷漫的东溪兵营已经出现在眼前。多少民工，挑饭筐的，抬子弹的，背上背着伤兵的，都忙碌地在来回奔跑。二姐和她的一群姐妹也迎上去，接住那些自己爬下来的和那些被同伍的战友们从火线上抢救出来的重伤员。
    那天下午，后面的一个山沟里，一百多女民工从前线回来，一躺下就呼呼地睡着了，许多人衣角上还带着一块块凝结了的血迹。
    千千万万的越南妇女正是像这些女民工一样，坚决地站在斗争的最前列，为争取完全驱逐法国侵略者而英勇地奋斗着。    二月十五日
