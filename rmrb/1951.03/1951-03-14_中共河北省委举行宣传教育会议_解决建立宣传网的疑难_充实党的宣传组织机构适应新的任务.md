　　Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Holds Propaganda and Education Conference

    Resolves Difficulties in Establishing a Propaganda Network

    Strengthens Party's Propaganda Organizations to Adapt to New Tasks

    [By Our Newspaper] The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held the Second Hebei Provincial Party Propaganda and Education Conference from January 29 to February 2, 1951, mainly to discuss the establishment of a propaganda network within the entire Party. During the conference, some doubts and incorrect ideas about establishing the propaganda network were exposed. Some comrades said: "There are so many tasks already, and the central government has added another trouble." Some comrades said: "The provincial committee just arranged to overcome the 'three excesses,' and now comes another excess." Some comrades said: "Engaging in propaganda work will affect the central tasks." Or, "Establishing a propaganda network conflicts with the current urgent tasks." Some comrades also excessively emphasized the difficulties that might be encountered in establishing a system of propagandists and reporters, emphasizing insufficient subjective effort and initiative, believing that the higher authorities' demands were too high; some areas demanded that a joint conference of branch secretaries, or a representative meeting of propagandists, or a propagandist conference be held at the county level every two or three months; some demanded that all reports from reporters at all levels be completely supplied by the higher authorities; some county party secretaries expressed that their own cultural and political levels were low and that they could not review the reporting materials of the reporters. Also, because the work of establishing a propaganda network within the entire Party was a new task, various places lacked experience, so many vague questions were raised in the discussion, such as how the party committee secretary and the propaganda department should divide the relationship with the propagandists; the relationship between the district party secretary, deputy secretary (the Hebei Provincial Committee stipulates that the district should add a deputy secretary specifically to manage propaganda and education work), and propaganda committee member and their relationship with the propagandists; the relationship between the village branch secretary and the propaganda committee member and the propagandists; how the undisclosed branch should lead the propagandists; whether the propagandists should be divided into groups, etc. The conclusion emphasized criticizing the above incorrect ideas and understandings and answered the specific questions raised by the participants.

    The conclusion emphasized that the idea that strengthening propaganda work would affect the central tasks is wrong. Only by establishing the propaganda network, establishing strong leadership, improving various systems, strengthening propaganda work, so that the Party's policies are mastered by the masses and the truth is supported by the masses, will great power be generated, and the numerous and important tasks can be completed faster and better. Therefore, establishing a propaganda network is not adding any trouble; on the contrary, it is precisely to reduce trouble and to accelerate the completion of tasks in the case of fewer cadres. If the masses are required to complete the work without raising their awareness, it will inevitably lead to simple administrative orders as a working method, resulting in the Party being separated from the masses. The conclusion severely criticized all negative emotions of not analyzing and studying the province's favorable conditions, only emphasizing difficulties, and not actively thinking about ways to overcome difficulties, and surrendering to difficulties.

    The conclusion also pointed out that party committees at all levels should regularly and frequently study the system of leading the work of propagandists. The party committee secretary must regard leading the work of propagandists as his important political task and personally take action. Municipal and county party secretaries must personally preside over the monthly joint meeting of branch secretaries or representative meeting of propagandists or propagandist conference and make political reports, unless under special circumstances, the responsibility should not be delegated to others (only in mountainous areas with difficult transportation or counties with other insufficient conditions, the method of holding meetings mainly by districts can be adopted, and members of the county party committee or non-county party cadres with higher political levels and the ability to complete this task entrusted by the county party committee shall be responsible for presiding). When convening this meeting and deploying the work of propagandists, attention should be paid to combining it with the deployment of the central work tasks of the time and place. Party committee secretaries should learn and be good at promoting and using the power of the organization, especially the power of the propaganda department, to carry out work. The propaganda department of the party committee should regard researching, guiding, and inspecting the work of propagandists, and providing the party committee and the party committee secretary with various situations in a timely manner, as its important business.

    The conclusion believes that after the establishment of the propaganda network, propaganda work has indeed increased, and the existing organizational structure and staffing can no longer meet the new tasks and requirements. Therefore, strengthening and enriching the Party's propaganda organizational structure has become one of the main conditions for party committees at all levels to establish a propaganda network.

    Based on the current situation of the Party's propaganda organization in counties and districts, the conference made the following provisions:

    A. The district committee should add one deputy secretary, who is dedicated to ideological education work.

    B. The district propaganda committee members should be fully staffed within three months, and the positions should be kept full; current vacancies should be filled immediately; incumbents who are incompetent should also be replaced.

    C. The organizational structure of the propaganda departments of municipal, county, and town committees should be fully staffed within six months according to the staffing, and should not be transferred casually. If a transfer is urgently needed, it must be supplemented first before being transferred.

　　中共河北省委举行宣传教育会议
    解决建立宣传网的疑难
    充实党的宣传组织机构适应新的任务
    【本报讯】中共河北省委于一九五一年一月二十九日至二月二日举行河北省第二次党的宣传教育会议，主要是讨论在全党建立宣传网的问题。在会议中暴露了对于建立宣传网工作的一些疑难和不正确的思想。有的同志说：“工作任务这么多，中央又给加上了一个麻烦。”有的同志说：“省委刚布置了克服三多，现在又来了一多。”有的同志说：“搞宣传工作就要影响中心工作。”或者说：“建立宣传网与当前各种紧急任务有矛盾。”有的同志还过分强调在建立宣传员和报告员一套制度中可能遇到的困难，强调主观的努力与能动性不足，认为上级要求太高；有的地区要求两个月或三个月以县为单位召开一次支部书记联席会议或宣传员代表会议或宣传员大会；有的要求各级报告员的报告完全由上级供给；有的县委书记表示自己文化、政治水平低，不能审查报告员的报告材料。又由于在全党建立宣传网的工作是一件新的工作，各地都缺乏经验，所以在讨论中提出了不少模糊不清的问题，如党委书记与宣传部对宣传员的关系如何分工；区委书记、副书记（河北省委规定区增设副书记专门管理宣教工作）、宣传委员之间及其对宣传员的关系；村支部书记与宣传委员对宣传员的关系；未公开的支部如何领导宣传员；宣传员是否划组等。结论中着重批评了上述不正确的思想和认识，并对与会同志提出的具体问题作了解答。
    结论中强调指出：认为加强宣传工作就会影响中心工作的思想，是错误的思想。只有将宣传网建立起来，树立了坚强的领导，健全了各种制度，加强了宣传工作，使党的政策为群众所掌握，真理为群众所拥护，才会发生伟大的力量，才能更快更好地完成繁多而重大的任务。因此，建立宣传网不但不是增加了什么麻烦；恰恰相反，却正是为了减少麻烦，正是为了在干部少的情况下来加速任务的完成。要是不提高群众觉悟就要群众完成工作，就必然产生简单的行政命令的工作方法，结果使党脱离了群众。结论严厉地批评了一切不分析与研究该省的有利条件，一味强调困难，而不积极想克服困难的办法，向困难低头的消极情绪。
    结论中并指出：各级党委应定期地和经常地研究领导宣传员工作的制度。党委书记必须把领导宣传员工作当作自己的重要政治任务，亲自动手。市、县委书记，必须亲自主持每月一次的支部书记联席会议或宣传员代表会议或宣传员大会，并作政治报告，除非在特殊情况下，不得将责任委之于他人（只在交通困难的山区或其他条件不足的县份，可采用以分地区召开为主的办法，由县委委员或受县委委托的政治水平较高并具备完成此项工作任务能力的非县委干部负责主持）。在召开此项会议、部署宣传员工作的时候，应当注意与布置当时当地中心工作任务结合起来。党委书记应当学会并善于推动和使用组织的力量，特别是宣传部门的力量来进行工作。党委宣传部应把研究、指导、检查宣传员的工作，及时供给党委会及党委书记以各种情况，作为自己的重要业务。
    结论中认为：建立宣传网之后，宣传业务确是增加了，现有的组织机构与编制已不能适应新的任务和要求。因此，加强和充实党的宣传组织机构，已成为各级党委建立宣传网的主要条件之一。
    会议根据目前县区党的宣传组织情况，作了如下规定：
    甲、区委会增设副书记一人，专管思想教育工作。
    乙、区宣传委员在三个月内保证调配齐全，并保持经常满员；目前缺额即予补充；现任而不称职者亦加以调换。
    丙、市、县、镇委宣传部的组织机构，应根据编制在半年内补充满员，并不得随便调动。如迫切需要调动时，必须先行补充而后抽调。
