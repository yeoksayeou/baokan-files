The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Meeting Continues
    Soviet Representative Proposes New Suggestions
    Meanwhile, the U.S., Britain, and France Secretly Discuss Rebuilding Nazi Armed Forces with West Germany

    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 30th] According to TASS, Paris, March 29th: The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference continued on the 28th, chaired by the Soviet representative, Gromyko.

    Gromyko pointed out in his speech: In order to conceal their own actions that violate the Potsdam Agreement's obligation to eliminate German militarism, the Western three countries deliberately fabricated groundless claims about Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania violating human rights and breaching the military clauses of the peace treaties. For this reason, the U.S. representative Jessup, on behalf of the Western three countries on the 27th, suggested including the issue of treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. The purpose of all these moves is to complicate the ongoing negotiations on the agenda.

    Gromyko continued: Considering the importance and urgency of the issue of eliminating German militarism, the Soviet delegation has always believed that the opposition of the Western three countries to including this issue as an independent item on the agenda is unfounded. However, in order to strive for an agreement on the agenda issue, the Soviet delegation believes it can put forward the following new suggestion: "To study the reasons for the existing international tensions in Europe and the various measures necessary to ensure a genuine and lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, including the following issues: the issue of eliminating German militarism; the issue of reducing the armed forces of the U.S., the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, and related discussions on existing levels of armaments, and the issue of establishing an international body to supervise the implementation of disarmament; the issue of other measures to eliminate the threat of war and fear of aggression; and the issue of fulfilling existing treaty obligations and agreements between the four countries." The Soviet delegation hopes that this suggestion will not be opposed by the three countries.

    Jessup, Davies, and Parodi stated that they would study the new suggestions of the Soviet delegation before expressing their opinions.

    [Xinhua News Agency, March 30th] TASS, Paris, March 30th: It is learned here that the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference, originally scheduled for the 29th, was suspended at the request of the Western representatives Jessup, Davies, and Parodi.

    The next meeting is scheduled for the 30th.

    [Xinhua News Agency, March 30th] At the same time that the Soviet representative in Paris proposed to make the issue of eliminating German militarism the primary agenda of the Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers Conference, the U.S., British, and French High Commissioners for Germany and the military representatives of the West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer, former Hitler generals Speidel, Heusinger, and Kielmansegg, are intensifying negotiations in Petersberg on rebuilding the Nazi army and even the navy and air force.

    According to the German News Agency, the secret negotiations, which began in early January, concluded on March 20th. At the meeting, Adenauer's representatives accepted the plan for establishing a West German army, which stipulates the establishment of twenty-two fully motorized divisions (ten of which are tank divisions). To this end, new recruits born between 1927 and 1933 will be conscripted first. Regional commands responsible for recruitment and training are currently being organized.

    Meanwhile, according to the German Press Agency, the Bonn government has officially stated that at the Petersberg meeting, U.S., British, and French representatives requested West Germany to establish a navy and air force. The plans for establishing a navy and air force have been drafted by Speidel and Heusinger and will be submitted at the Petersberg meeting in mid-April. According to the German Press Agency, the planned West German air force will include several bomber squadrons. At present, so-called "Air Defense Associations" are being established everywhere in West Germany (with their headquarters in Wiesbaden, the location of the U.S. Air Force Europe Command) as preparatory steps for the establishment of the future West German air force.

　　四外长助理会议继续举行
    苏联代表提出新建议     
    美、英、法同时却与西德秘谈重建纳粹军队
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十九日讯：四国外长助理会议二十八日继续开会，由苏联代表葛罗米柯任主席。
    葛罗米柯在发言中指出：西方三国为了掩饰它们自己破坏波茨坦协定关于肃清德国军国主义的义务的行动，故意捏造了所谓保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚侵犯人权及破坏和约中军事条款的无稽之谈。由于这种原因，美国代表耶塞普于二十七日代表西方三国建议把有关对保、匈、罗和约的问题列入外长会议议程。所有这些举动的目的，就是要使正在进行的关于议程的谈判复杂化。
    葛罗米柯继称：苏联代表团鉴于关于肃清德国军国主义问题的重要与迫切，一向就认为西方三国代表反对把这一问题作为独立的一项议案列入议程，是没有根据的。但是，苏联代表团为力求在议程问题上达成协议，认为可以提出新建议如下：“研究欧洲现存国际紧张局势的原因以及为保证苏、美、英、法四国之间的关系真正而持久的改善所必需的种种措施，其中包括以下各项问题：关于肃清德国军国主义的问题；关于裁减美、苏、英、法四国军队的问题以及与此相关的讨论现有军备水平问题和关于建立国际机构监督实行裁军的问题；关于消除战争威胁与侵略恐惧的其他措施的问题：关于履行四国间现有条约义务及协定的问题。”苏联代表团希望这个建议不致遭到三国的反对。
    耶塞普、戴维斯、巴罗第表示将研究苏联代表团的新建议，然后再表示意见。
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社巴黎三十日讯：此间获悉：原订二十九日举行的四国外长助理会议，应西方国家代表耶塞普、戴维斯、巴罗第的要求停止举行。
    下次会议订于三十日举行。
    【新华社三十日讯】与苏联代表在巴黎提出要把肃清德国军国主义的问题作为苏、美、英、法四国外长会议的首要议程同时，美、英、法三国驻德高级专员公署与西德傀儡总理阿登纳的军事代表，前希特勒将领斯派达尔、豪辛格和纪尔曼塞格之间，却正在彼得斯堡加紧进行重建纳粹陆军以至海空军的谈判。
    据德意志通讯社报道：这个从一月初就开始的秘密谈判已在三月二十日告一段落。在会上，阿登纳的代表已接受了关于建立西德陆军的计划，其中规定建立二十二个完全摩托化的师（有十个是坦克师），为此，首先将征召一九二七——三三年出生的新兵入伍。负责征召与训练工作的各地区司令部现已在组织中。
    同时，据电通社报道：波恩政府已正式表示：在彼得斯堡会议上，美、英、法代表曾要求西德建立海空军。建立海空军的计划已交由斯派达尔与豪辛格起草，将于四月中旬在彼得斯堡会议上提出。据电通社说：计划中的西德空军将包括若干轰炸机中队。目前西德各地正在纷纷成立所谓“防空协会”（其总部设于美国驻欧空军司令部所在地威斯巴登）作为建立未来西德空军的准备步骤。
