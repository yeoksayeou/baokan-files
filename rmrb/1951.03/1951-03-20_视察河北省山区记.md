　　A Record of Inspecting Mountainous Areas in Hebei Province
       Zhao Xiushan Cao Zemin
    In January and February of this year, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the People's Government of Hebei Province, successively inspected the mountainous areas of Fuping, Quyang, Miyun, Huairou, Jixian, Zunhua, and Qianxi in Hebei Province. On behalf of the leading organs of Hebei Province, he extended condolences to the people in the mountainous areas, conveyed the care of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government to the people in the mountainous areas, conveyed the instructions of the Central People's Government on production in the mountainous areas, distributed winter clothing, relief grain, and production loans allocated by the Central People's Government to the people in the mountainous areas, and helped various counties study production plans for the mountainous areas. Therefore, the people in the mountainous areas excitedly expressed: "Chairman Yang has brought us unlimited confidence and unlimited strength!"
    Hebei Province is bounded by mountains on the northwest, with about three thousand li of road along the mountains, from the south to the north, turning to Shanhaiguan. There are forty-three counties in these mountainous areas, including more than 10,000 villages and six million people. Some counties are close to the plains, near railways, with convenient transportation, and better agricultural and water conservancy conditions. Handicraft industry, animal husbandry, and household sideline businesses also have a foundation, people have more income and better lives, and production investment is also larger. Most counties are located in deep mountainous areas, with many mountains and little land, with an average of about two mu of land per person, and only 1.2 mu in some areas, and the soil quality is not strong, and the yield is very low. The annual harvest is only enough for farmers to eat for half a year. In addition, the grain seeds in these places are complex, the climate is different from the plains, and they often suffer from natural disasters of varying degrees. Transportation is also inconvenient, and it is difficult to transport mountain goods and local products. People have very little income, so they lack food and clothing, and have no ability to invest in production. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, although the mountains and forests were lush and there were many fruits and mountain products, most of them belonged to a few mountain kings and landlords, and the farmers worked all year round without getting enough to eat. They lived in poverty for generations, some sleeping in mountain caves, covered with firewood and grass; individual farmers never knew what the plains looked like in their lives, and never ate white flour. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders carried out countless burnings, killings, and lootings against farmers in mountainous areas, creating large uninhabited areas. Good fields have turned into wilderness. According to incomplete statistics from mountainous counties, the loss of livestock alone reached 97 percent in some areas and more than 73 percent in others. To this day, farmers' wealth has not returned to its original state.
    These mountainous areas are the old home of the People's Liberation Army of North China, and the old base areas of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The People's Government once led farmers here to carry out rent and interest reduction and implement land reform, and most farmers obtained land. Under Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production by an inch," they worked hard to carry out the great production movement. In this way, the agriculture, industry, and handicraft sideline industries in the mountainous areas have been initially restored, and mountain goods and cash crops have also been initially sold well, and the rural market has begun to prosper. The vast labor force has work to do, and a group of production models have emerged. Farmers have increased their income, and their lives have improved compared to before. After their lives are improved, they will never forget the salvation of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Therefore, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, they actively contributed money and manpower and shouldered heavy war service. Their houses were first used by the People's Liberation Army, and their grain was first eaten by the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, it can be said that the farmers in the mountainous areas of Hebei Province are inextricably linked to the founding of our People's Republic of China.
    After the liberation of the mainland of the country, the political and economic center shifted to large cities. Rural handicraft industry and sideline industries have partially stagnated. In addition, in recent years, mountain floods have burst, terraced fields have been washed away, beaches have been silted with sand, fruit trees have been infested with insects, and farmland harvests have been poor, and the lives of farmers in mountainous areas have declined compared to before. Under such circumstances, the People's Government of Hebei Province has vigorously supported the production of farmers in mountainous areas since the spring of last year. It has specially convened a mountain production conference and formulated a mountain production plan. The tax burden has been reduced a lot, and more relief grain has been allocated to mountainous areas. After the autumn of 1950, the relief grain issued to mountainous areas accounted for two-fifths of the province's relief grain. Extra care has also been given to the most difficult mountainous counties. In addition, subsidies have been given to poor village-level cadres and primary school teachers with family difficulties, plus the distribution of winter clothing, totaling more than 3 million catties of grain. Recently, the Central People's Government allocated 160,000 sets of winter clothing and loans to farmers in mountainous areas throughout the province. Therefore, farmers in mountainous areas are grateful for Chairman Mao's care. They unanimously expressed their determination to improve production in mountainous areas as a tribute to Chairman Mao.
    How can we improve production in mountainous areas? According to the spirit of the State Council of the Central People's Government's decision on agricultural and forestry production in 1951, we must establish a long-term construction idea in the minds of cadres and farmers. First of all, start with restoring production, and gradually develop mountain resources. This requires the leading organs to conduct in-depth investigation and research and planning, closely combine the restoration of mountain production with disaster relief, adopt a "once and for all" approach, and focus on the deep mountain areas. At the same time, the focus of work should be on developing forestry and animal husbandry and maintaining and consolidating soil and water in mountainous areas. Strengthen organizational leadership, assign special personnel to be responsible, and do the following specific tasks well:
    (1) Protect and repair terraced fields, consolidate existing cultivated land, so as to increase grain production and expand investment. Last year, 540,000 mu of terraced fields and beaches were washed away in mountainous areas throughout the province. This year, in order to prevent mountain floods in advance, various places can plan to select appropriate slopes and valleys at the source of various rivers as the focus of repairing new terraced fields. And it should be carried out simultaneously with afforestation and cultivation of fruit trees. This can not only prevent floods and intercept sand, but also increase production. In addition, it is also necessary to use all possible water sources to develop small canals and expand the area of paddy fields. Straighten the ditches and protect the cultivated land on both sides. The above work requires strengthening organizational work and can be realized through mutual assistance.
    (2) Vigorously close mountains for afforestation, and organize farmers to sow barren mountains in a planned and led manner. Restrict wasteland reclamation, cultivate pasture, and strictly prohibit burning mountains, so as to maintain soil and water and seedlings. Thus, gradually eliminate the harm of floods and wind and sand. In afforestation, we should first protect existing forests, and at the same time vigorously promote cooperative afforestation. Various places can determine the focus of forestry and sowing according to specific conditions. Organize farmers to democratically formulate conventions for banning mountains and protecting forests, improve mass forest protection organizations, delineate mountain boundaries, and clarify mountain rights and tree rights. In terms of methods, we can launch a competition among farmers to raise mountains and protect forests to inspire farmers' enthusiasm. In order to improve cultivation technology, we can adopt small-scale seminars, training, visits and internships to exchange experience.
    (3) Cultivating fruit trees is an important measure to improve the lives of people in mountainous areas. However, existing fruit trees must be protected. This requires mobilizing farmers to eliminate fruit tree pests. In terms of methods, Miyun County can adopt the method of exchanging rice (using part of the relief grain) for insect eggs to encourage farmers to collect eggs. In addition to this, district and village cadres should study the small booklet on pest control of fruit trees issued by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the People's Government of Hebei Province, combine scientific and technological knowledge with farmers' experience, and guide farmers to carry out pest control and egg eradication campaigns.
    (4) Restoring and developing animal husbandry is an important link to gradually lead mountainous areas to prosperity. The reason why farmers in mountainous areas were relatively wealthy before the incident was mainly due to the development of animal husbandry. For example, in Huairou County, before the war, each household had an average of ten cows, and now two households have an average of one cow. This shows that developing animal husbandry is the urgent requirement of farmers in mountainous areas. In 1951, the province plans to add 100,000 sheep and breed 150,000 sheep on the basis of 600,000 sheep. At the same time, it is required to breed and purchase 15,000 livestock. In order to achieve this goal, the government is prepared to give loan support. Various places should master breeding and feeding techniques, and strengthen the prevention and control of animal diseases, and set up breeding stations with emphasis to gradually improve breeds.
    In addition, mountainous areas are rich in mineral resources, and prospecting should also be organized, and farmers should be appropriately supported to mine.

　　视察河北省山区记
       赵秀山　曹泽民
    今年一、二两月内，河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席，曾连续两次视察了河北省阜平、曲阳、密云、怀柔、蓟县、遵化、迁西等山区，代表河北省各领导机关向山区人民进行了慰问，转达了中央人民政府毛主席对山区人民的关怀，传达了中央人民政府对山区生产的指示，分发了中央人民政府拨给山区人民的寒衣、救济粮和生产贷款，并帮助各县研究了山区生产计划。因此，山区人民兴奋地表示：“杨主席给我们带来了无限的信心，带来了无限的力量！”
    河北省西北两面靠山，沿着山计算，从南头到北头拐弯到山海关，约有三千里路。这些山地里有四十三个县，包括一万多个村庄，六百万人口。其中小部县份接近平原，靠近铁路，交通便利，农业水利条件较好，手工业、牧畜业及家庭副业也有基础，人民收入较多，生活较好，生产投资也较大。大部县份处于深山地带，山多地少，每人平均二亩地左右，个别地区才平均一亩二分地，且土质不强，产量很低，每年的收成，只够农民半年食用。加以这些地方的粮种繁杂，气候和平原不同，又经常遭受各种程度不同的天然灾害，交通也不方便，山货土产运输困难，人民的收入极少，所以缺吃少穿，更无力投资生产。抗日战争以前，虽然山林茂盛，果产山货很多，但大部分属于少数的山王、地主，农民们却是终年劳作不得温饱。他们世世代代过着穷困的日子，有些是夜宿山洞，铺柴盖草；个别的农民，一辈子不知道平原什么样，没吃过白面。抗日战争中，日寇对山区农民，曾进行过无数次的烧杀抢掠，造成了大块的无人区。使良好的田园，变成了荒野。据山区各县不完整的统计，只牲口一项损失，多者达百分之九十七，少的也在百分之七十三以上。到如今，农民的财力还没有恢复原状。
    这些山区，是华北人民解放军的老家，是抗日战争、解放战争的老根据地。人民政府在这里曾经领导农民进行过减租减息，实行过土地改革，大部分农民得到了土地。他们在毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召下，努力地开展了大生产运动。这样一来，山区的农业、工业及手工副业才得到了初步恢复，山货和经济作物也得到了初步畅销，农村市场开始繁荣。广大劳动力有了活干，并涌现出一批生产模范。农民增加了收入，生活也就较前提高了。他们的生活提高以后，永不会忘掉共产党和人民政府对他们的拯救。因此，他们在抗日战争和解放战争中，都踊跃出钱出人和负担着繁重的战争勤务。他们的房屋，先尽着人民解放军住，他们的粮食，先尽着人民解放军吃。所以说：河北省山区的农民，和我中华人民共和国的成立，是血肉不可分离的。
    全国大陆解放以后，政治经济中心转入了大城市。农村手工业和副业曾部分停滞，再加上近年来山洪暴发，梯田被冲，滩地淤沙，果树生虫，农田歉收，山区农民的生活又较前下降。在这种情况下，河北省人民政府从去年春天就大力扶持山区农民生产，曾经专门召开过山区生产会议，制订山区生产计划。在税收负担上减轻了好多，在救济粮的使用上，也多给山区拨发。一九五○年秋后，发给山区的救济粮占全省救济粮的五分之二。最困难的山区县份，还格外进行了照顾。另外对贫苦的村级干部和家庭困难的小学教员，都进行了补助，加上寒衣的发放，折粮共达三百多万斤。最近，中央人民政府又拨给全省山区农民十六万套寒衣，还有贷款。因此，山区农民无不感激毛主席的关怀，他们一致表示：决心把山区生产提高一步，作为对毛主席的敬意。
    怎样使山区生产提高一步呢？根据中央人民政府政务院一九五一年的农林生产决定的精神，必须在干部和农民的心目中树立长期建设思想。首先从恢复生产着手，逐步开辟山区资源。这就需要领导机关作深入的调查研究和计划，把恢复山区生产和救灾密切结合起来，采取“一劳永逸”的办法，重点应对着深山地区。同时，应以发展林木和牧畜业及保持与巩固山地水土为工作重点。加强组织领导，责成专人负责，作好下列几项具体工作：
    （一）保护与整修梯田，巩固现有的耕地，以便增产粮食，扩大投资。去年全省山区冲毁了五十四万亩梯田滩地，今年为事先预防山洪，各地可有计划地选择各个河流发源地的适当坡峪，作为修新梯田的重点。并与造林培植果树同时进行。这样既能防洪拦沙，又能增产。此外还需利用一切可能利用的水源，开发小型渠道，扩大水田面积。修顺涧沟，保护两岸耕地。上述工作，都需加强组织工作，通过互助的办法才能实现。
    （二）大力封山育林，有计划有领导地组织农民荒山播种。限制开荒，培养牧草，严禁烧山，以保持水土和树苗。从而逐渐消灭水灾和风沙危害。在造林中，首先应保护现有的林木，同时应大力提倡合作造林。各地可根据具体条件，确定育林和播种重点。组织农民民主制订禁山护林公约，健全群众性的护林组织，划清山界，明确山权树权。在方法上，可以发动农民开展养山护林的评比运动，以启发农民的积极性。为提高栽培技术，可采取小型座谈、训练、访问和实习的办法，交流经验。
    （三）栽培果树是改善山区人民生活的重要措施。但对现有的果树，必须加以保护。这就需要发动农民除治果树虫害。在方式上，可采取密云县以米（用一部分救济粮）换虫卵的方法，鼓舞农民采卵情绪。除此，区村干部应学习河北省人民政府农林厅印发的果树除虫小册子，把科学技术和农民的经验结合起来，指导农民开展除虫灭卵运动。
    （四）恢复发展畜牧业，是使山区逐渐走向富裕的重要环节。事变前山区农民较富裕的原因，主要是畜牧业发达。如怀柔县在战前，每户平均十头牛，现在两户平均一头牛。由此可见发展畜牧业是山区农民的迫切要求。一九五一年全省计划从六十万只羊的基础上，增添十万只，繁殖十五万只。同时要求繁殖和购买一万五千头牲口。为达到这个目的，政府准备给以贷款扶植。各地应掌握繁殖和喂养技术，并加强兽疫防治工作，有重点地设立种畜站，逐渐作到改良品种。
    另外，山区矿藏丰富，也应组织勘察，适当地扶植农民开采。
