　　Combined Transportation and Urban-Rural Material Exchange
　　Huang Yifeng

　　In April 1950, the First East China Transportation Conference made a decision on developing water-land combined transportation in East China. In May, under the leadership of the Ministry of Transportation, the state-owned East China Combined Transportation Company was established. Up to now, the construction of transportation organizations in East China has spread to all relatively important cities and ports in East China. Seven branch companies, eleven sub-branch companies, thirty-one offices, and forty-nine combined transportation stations have been established in various provinces and districts of East China. In terms of opening combined transportation routes, a step-by-step approach from point to area, from one line to multiple lines has been adopted. Eighteen main combined transportation lines have been constructed. For transportation companies in major administrative regions and departments responsible for entrusted transportation of materials, the method of signing contracts has been adopted to achieve close ties. From mid-May to the end of last year, the general and branch companies transported a total of 1,855,822 tons of materials. In terms of business, along with the development of business, service fees have been reduced four times to reduce the burden on cargo owners, which is 30% to 70% lower than the fees charged by general transfer industries. The principle of low profit and high volume transportation has been correctly implemented. It has initially played a certain role in urban-rural material exchange and market stability. For example, tea transportation in northern Anhui starts with tea collection from villages in the Dabie Mountains, and is concentrated along highways by tools such as shoulder poles, bamboo rafts, and hand carts, and then transported to railway stations and wharfs by trucks for further transportation. This truly achieves combined transportation. 35,000 tons of grain from Shandong were collected and transported from countless villages and towns in more than sixty counties to various places in southern China, and the task was completely completed.

　　Experience has shown that organizing combined transportation has played a significant role in urban-rural material exchange, stabilizing the market, and improving the lives of farmers. This year, land reform will be completed in most parts of the country, and agricultural productivity will be greatly improved. In order to digest the large amount of agricultural products of farmers and meet the needs of industrial products caused by the increase in farmers' purchasing power, the work of urban-rural material exchange will be more important. Therefore, organizing and developing combined transportation will be one of the main ways to cooperate with trade and cooperative departments to complete the task of urban-rural material exchange.

　　　　I. What is Combined Transportation?

　　Combined transportation is a comprehensive transportation business. Simply put, it is package transportation, or transfer transportation, which is responsible for transportation. Because China is a large country, small producers are scattered, and concentrating goods is an arduous task. In addition, geographical conditions and water and land transportation are intertwined, and there are various tools. One transportation needs to pass through several tools, several times of loading and unloading, and a very complicated transportation procedure. The difficulty of freight calculation, the lower cultural level of some merchants, etc., the combined transportation business came into being. Comprehensively, combined transportation will include the following:

　　(1) Combined transportation must combine various different transportation tools and allocate them appropriately. Because China is vast and rich in resources, and transportation tools are backward, urban and rural materials must be able to flow smoothly to meet the needs of supply and demand. It is necessary to concentrate scattered materials and transport them to the sales market, and various different transportation tools must be used. In order to avoid the trouble of intermediate turnover, loading, unloading and transfer for public professional companies and merchants, the combined transportation business operators will take care of these troublesome affairs, so that merchants are happy to undertake the task of urban-rural material exchange and are profitable. If the combined transportation business operators organize sufficient sources of goods and master the tools, they can further select tools in a planned way based on the length of the route, convenient transportation conditions, freight rates, and comparison of transportation capacity. For example, in areas where both water and land transportation are accessible, combined transportation can consider the cargo's affordability and time requirements to choose transportation routes and the most suitable tools. If Shanghai transports goods to Fujian, if the maritime safety rate is improved, it will be directly shipped to Fuzhou by sea, without having to be transported by rail, road and even waterways, so as to reduce the procedures of loading and unloading many times, and the transportation volume can be greatly expanded. The freight for shipping one ton of goods by sea is many times cheaper than several transfers by railway, highway and waterway.

　　(2) Combined transportation is the connection and integration of various different transportation businesses. The transportation process that goods go through from the place of origin to the market is very complicated. From consignment, receiving, transfer, loading and unloading, escorting, storage to delivery, there is a series of very tight and complicated operations. Usually, transportation organizations often cannot complete these tasks one by one, nor can they combine them well, thus causing unnecessary losses to the goods. For example, due to the slow loading and unloading, many railway cars and barges are occupied as temporary warehouses, affecting the reduction of tool turnover rate. Other problems such as the lack of rain-proof equipment and poor boxing technology can easily cause cargo transportation accidents. For example, the bridge at Pukou Ferry Station was damaged once last year, and the train could not cross the river in its original car. At that time, East China Combined Transportation Company took on the task of organizing ships and barging more than 10,000 tons of materials, so that the north-south freight of the Yangtze River was spared from stagnation, which was convenient for cargo owners, railways, and more conducive to the market. On the other hand, following the exchange of materials, there are also various businesses such as documentary bills, insurance, customs declaration, packaging, agency purchase and sales, and travel agencies, which are not only required by cargo owners, but also often become a heavy burden that cargo owners cannot bear due to their complex nature. However, the combined transportation business can use professionally trained personnel to charge very few handling fees to meet the requirements of cargo owners and serve cargo owners.

　　(3) Combined transportation must organize and concentrate various scattered sources of goods. Because our products are scattered and enterprises are individually operated, especially the sideline production in rural areas, to be transported to the market, the consignment of goods is scattered and must be transferred, carried and concentrated by various different tools, and then modern tools can be used to transport them to the market at a relatively economical freight rate. For example, railway whole car freight is much more economical in terms of procedures and costs than other freight, but whole car consignment must be at least fifteen tons. Cargo owners often cannot help but consign other goods because the amount of goods consigned at one time is not large (especially local products). This is unfavorable to both the use of railway vehicles and the freight burden of cargo owners. Combined transportation solves this difficulty. It can collect the goods of various cargo owners to consolidate the whole car. The utilization rate of the car is improved, and the number of other cars attached to passenger trains can be reduced. The work of East China Combined Transportation Company's land transportation department in collecting zero and consolidating the whole car has reduced a lot of trouble for the North Freight Station of the Railway Bureau. The situation of shipping is also the same. For irregular freighters, individual cargo owners often have to wait a long time at the wharf or warehouse before they can be shipped because they do not consign many goods. Combined transportation can collect many scattered sources of goods and contact special ships to carry them, which greatly saves time.

　　(4) Combined transportation can formulate transportation plans based on the frequent consignment records of cargo owners and submit them to transportation organizations for consignment. In order to more effectively allocate tools and improve operating efficiency, major transportation organizations require cargo owners to submit consignment plans in advance, but this is difficult for more scattered freight. Combined transportation can master the movement of goods through frequent contact with cargo owners, consider the actual transportation capacity of various tools, adjust and coordinate, and formulate transportation plans, which solves this difficulty for transportation organizations. Therefore, the widespread expansion of combined transportation can gradually pave the way for the realization of planned transportation.

　　(5) Combined transportation can handle the material allocation, storage and transportation business of various professional companies. For example, state-owned salt, coal, grain, local products, department stores and other companies must each set up large-scale storage and transportation organizations in various cities and towns, operate transportation by themselves, and manage transportation tools by themselves. In fact, it is difficult to be perfect and skilled. The combined transportation company can centrally operate as the storage and transportation department of various professional companies, achieve the purpose of transportation specialization, and also reduce their expenses and troubles.

　　In short, combined transportation is the combination of modern and backward tools for transportation tools; for transportation business, it is the integration of various main and auxiliary businesses; for the source of goods, it is the organizer of the source of goods from scattered to concentrated; for the coordination of transportation capacity and transportation volume, it is the planner who makes the combination of tools and the source of goods reach the most economical and reasonable; for various professional companies, it can become the centralized operator of their material storage and transportation business. Only such a complex and meticulous transportation business can meet the current objective requirements for transportation and can undertake the major task of developing urban-rural material exchange.

　　　　II. Who Should Handle Combined Transportation?

　　Now that the importance of combined transportation in material exchange has been clarified, who should handle combined transportation? Since liberation, railway bureaus, shipping companies and automobile transportation companies have been handling combined transportation and have achieved certain results. However, due to the basic backwardness and imbalance of China's transportation situation, all transportation tools and equipment, especially modern transportation tools, are obviously in short supply for the increasingly large source of goods. Only by vigorously organizing various mass backward tools, from rural to urban areas, from mountainous areas to plains, from inland rivers to large rivers, and appropriately coordinating and using them, can this requirement be met. It is bound to be a very heavy burden to entrust this task to the existing modern transportation organizations. At the same time, if the transportation organization also handles combined transportation, it will not only be restricted by its own transportation conditions (it only masters one kind), but also the procedures for organizing the source of goods, material receiving, transfer and loading will inevitably hinder it from focusing on its own business, shifting the focus, and creating unnecessary internal competition, offsetting the strength. For example, Anhui Southern Transportation Company and Zhejiang Transportation Company both established cargo operation offices in Tunxi to attract tea transportation, causing competition. For another example, Shanghai Railway Bureau, in addition to holding passenger combined transportation with Zhejiang Transportation Company on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, will no longer sign more combined transportation contracts with other transportation organizations before it has sufficient transportation capacity to focus on developing the railway business. For another example, in the early stage of the development of combined transportation in Shandong, it mainly relied on automobile transportation companies, but with the widespread construction of combined transportation organizations and the in-depth development of business in rural areas, it is no longer a task that a single automobile transportation company can undertake. It has begun to feel that there must be a specialized combined transportation organization to handle combined transportation. Therefore, the large-scale development of combined transportation, based on immature experience, must have a specialized organization to handle combined transportation.

　　In the past, private transfer companies, crossing banks, commercial shops, travel agencies and the like occupied a considerable proportion in the transportation industry, and played a certain role in connecting urban and rural relations and facilitating production and sales. However, the simple profit-seeking point of view and small-scale decentralized operation hindered their progressiveness. Not only high profits, but also the average collection of transportation handling fees is more than 20%, which increases transportation costs and hinders transportation and sales. Some unscrupulous elements, such as scalper transportation companies, use cargo owners' ignorance of transportation to extort and defraud in order to obtain illegal profits. At the same time, because the private transfer industry itself cannot master the tools, there is a lack of guarantee for the entrusted transportation of goods. In order to reduce transportation costs, improve transportation efficiency, and ensure the stability and speed of cargo transportation, it is impossible to simply rely on these private transfer industries, but it is necessary to plan and step-by-step build a state-owned combined transportation organization to develop combined transportation. Only in this way can these private transfer industries be led, united and transformed.

　　At present, the main business of the Ministry of Transportation of the People's Government is highways and navigation. Regardless of the number of tools and the scope of access, both are effective forces from point to area, connecting urban and rural areas and promoting material exchange. For combined transportation, relying on highways and navigation to organize good tools and further organize and develop the source of goods, the prospect of development is infinitely broad. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the transportation departments of various districts and provinces to set up a specialized agency for combined transportation, which is more suitable for combining tools and organizing the source of goods. First, because the transportation department has mastered a variety of transportation tools, such as large and small ships, wooden sailing ships, automobiles, and horse-drawn carts. In East China, there are 193,538 tons of inland motorized ships, 1,106,600 tons of inland wooden sailing ships, 10,541 automobiles, and about 10,000 human and animal-powered vehicles (referring to those running on highways). This can be used as a strong guarantee for the development of combined transportation. Second, because the institutions of the Ministry of Transportation penetrate into all levels of local governments, they can fully rely on local governments to quickly expand the construction of the combined transportation network, which greatly saves manpower and material resources, and is extremely convenient for business expansion.

　　To sum up, the guiding principle for handling combined transportation should be "tools are organized separately, and business is operated centrally." In this way, it can conform to the principle of transportation specialization. Using combined transportation to reduce the procedures of transportation organizations, rationally use transportation forces, and use the combined transportation company as the sales department of all transportation organizations, so as to achieve the purpose of not for profit, but for serving cargo owners and transportation organizations, and for serving urban-rural material exchange. After the combined transportation network is generally established in various regions, it is possible to quickly and systematically distribute countless types of goods with countless origin and destination points with just one phone call and one notice, and safely reach the consignee.

　　　　III. How to Handle Combined Transportation?

　　After the establishment of East China Combined Transportation Company, it organized the combined transportation of materials and achieved certain results, but there were also many shortcomings in the specific work. The main reason is that the work of organizing the source of goods is limited to a few large cities, and it is not enough to go deep into the countryside and take care of the overall situation. The use of tools mainly relies on trains, automobiles and ships, and has not further expanded the work of combining backward tools. At the same time, due to unfamiliarity with the business, various large and small accidents occurred. Therefore, in the future, attention must be paid to the following points when handling combined transportation.

　　(1) Attach importance to the combination of modern and backward tools. The current situation is that the years are bountiful and the state has a large amount of material purchase, sales and adjustment. The task of urban-rural material exchange is becoming increasingly heavy. The situation in terms of transportation is that, on the one hand, railway and water transportation are congested, and on the other hand, materials scattered in rural areas cannot be transported out in time. This shows that vigorously organizing backward tools is the current urgent task. For example, the transportation volume of wooden sailing ships in East China exceeds the total transportation volume of railways and coastal transportation along the Yangtze River. Combined transportation workers must pay attention to these vast backward tools and make full use of them as an important weapon for connecting urban and rural areas.

　　(2) The organization of the source of goods must go from cities to rural areas. The main source of goods is in rural areas, and the exchange of industrial raw materials, agricultural products and industrial products is the central link in revitalizing the national economy. On the one hand, combined transportation should closely rely on local governments and combine with local organizations to develop the combined transportation network; on the other hand, it should closely cooperate with the purchasing stations of state-owned trade organizations and cooperatives to go deep into rural areas to organize and develop the source of goods.

　　(3) Universally promote contract transportation to consolidate and expand the source of goods. Precisely because contract transportation can meet the specific requirements of cargo owners and adapt to the transportation capacity of transportation organizations, it has become an effective way to consolidate and steadily expand the source of goods for the combined transportation business, which is growing and becoming stronger. The rapid development of combined transportation in Shandong is also due to the results achieved by the implementation of contract transportation. On the one hand, combined transportation companies can use combined transportation contracts to contact trade, cooperation and other material organizations; on the other hand, they can use transportation contracts to organize various tools and establish relations with trains, automobiles, ships, and wooden boats, master and allocate the actual transportation capacity of each transportation organization, allocate transportation routes and transportation plans, and further create conditions for planned transportation.

　　(4) Be good at contacting the masses and organizing the source of goods. Organizing the source of goods not only requires going deep into the countryside, but also requires being good at contacting the masses. It is necessary to fully understand the transportation routes, sales routes, quantities and prices of local and special products in various places, and to combine transportation and sales. The production organization is "producing according to sales," while the combined transportation organization is "transporting according to sales," so as to better serve the masses. At the same time, in the work of organizing the source of goods, publicity is also important. It is necessary to use various publicity methods to tell the masses about the production and sales situation and transportation methods of local and special products in various regions. It is necessary to adopt various methods to reduce the transportation and sales costs of goods and expand the sales of goods in order to further develop the source of goods.

　　(5) Be proficient in business technology and do a good job in combined transportation. The long-term goal of the transportation business is to transport more, transport well, and transport quickly. In order to improve transportation efficiency and reduce transportation costs, it is necessary to be proficient in business technology and familiar with the performance and functions of various tools. It is necessary to not only learn how to investigate and organize the source of goods and unite cargo owners, but also be familiar with all the systems and methods in the operation work. It is necessary to learn to use various new mechanical equipment, such as cranes and winches, so that combined transportation is not only a heavy organizational work, but also a very specialized technical work.

　　Therefore, the combined transportation company is an organization that operates comprehensive transportation business. It does not have many tools, but it can use all tools. Various sources of goods can be organized and distributed through it, and various transportation organizations can carry out transportation separately to successfully complete the task. It is the best organizer of transportation. Only with the widespread development of combined transportation can producers strive for production. Only when various transportation organizations focus on their own business can the task of urban-rural material exchange be successfully completed.

　　联运业务和城乡物资交流
    黄逸峰
    一九五○年四月，华东第一届交通会议上作出了关于发展华东水陆联运事业的决定。五月间，在交通部的领导下，即成立了国营华东联运公司。截至目前止，华东运输机构的建设，已经普及到华东各个比较重要的城市与港口。在华东各省、区成立了七个分公司，十一个支公司，三十一个办事处，四十九个联运站。在联运路线的开辟上，掌握了从点到面、从一线到多线稳步发展的步骤，主要建设了十八条联运线。对于各大行政区的运输公司与掌握物资的委托运输部门之间，则采用了签订合同的方法，取得了密切联系。从五月中旬到去年年底，总、分公司一共运送了物资一、八五五、八二二吨。在营业上，伴随着业务的开展，四次减低服务费率，减轻了货主负担，比一般转运业所收费用低了三成到七成，正确地贯彻了低利多运的方针。对于城乡物资交流及稳定市场方面，已初步发挥了一定作用。如皖北运茶，由大别山区按村收茶做起，通过肩挑、排筏、手车等工具集中到公路沿线，用汽车运到铁路车站、轮船码头再向外运，真正做到了联运。山东三五、○○○吨的粮食，从六十多个县的无数村镇中集中分运到江南各地，彻底完成了任务。
    经验证明：组织联运业务，对于城乡物资交流，稳定市场，改善农民生活起了极大的作用。今年全国大部地区土地改革完成，农业生产力将大为提高，为了消纳农民的大量产品与满足农民增加购买力所引起的工业生产品的需要，城乡物资交流的工作将更加重要。因而组织与发展联运业务，将为配合贸易、合作部门完成城乡物资交流任务的主要办法之一。
            一、什么是联运业务？
    联运业务是一种综合性的运输业务。简单地说来，就是包运，或者叫做转运，也就是负责运输。由于中国是一个大国，小生产者零零星星，集中货品便是一个艰巨的工作，再加上地理条件水陆交通交错，工具多种多样，一次运输需要通过几种工具，几番装卸转驳，以及跟着而来的很繁复的运输手续，运价计算的困难，部分客商的文化水准较低等等，联运业务便应运而生。综合起来，联运业务将包括下列各项：
    （一）联运业务要结合各种不同运输工具，并适当地加以调配。因为中国地大物博，加上交通工具的落后，城乡物资要能达到畅流，适应供求需要，把分散的物资集中，再运到销货市场，必需运用各种不同的运输工具。为了使公营专业公司与客商避免中途周转装卸转驳的麻烦，联运业务经营者便把这些麻烦事务包下来，使客商乐于担任城乡物资交流的任务，而且有利可图。如果联运业务经营者组织了充分的货源，又掌握了工具，还可以进一步地根据路线距离长短，运输便利条件，运价高低，运输力的比较，有计划地选择工具。例如在水陆运输都可以通达的地区，联运可以考虑货物的负担能力与时间的要求，来选择运输路线与最适宜的工具。如由上海运输货物到福建，如果海上安全率提高，则直接海运至福州，不必再由铁路、公路以至水路转辗运输，以减省好多次的装卸搬运的手续，而在运量方面亦可以扩大得多。一吨货物海运运费比起铁路公路水运的几番转运，要节省好多倍。
    （二）联运是各种不同运输业务的联系与综合。货物从产地到市场，所经历的运输过程是很繁复的，从托运、接运、转驳、装卸、押运、保管到提货，有着一系列的非常紧凑繁复的运转工作，通常运输机构往往不能很好地逐一完成这些工作，也不能很好地结合起来，因而使货物受到不必要的损失。例如由于装卸的迟缓，许多铁路车皮与驳船被占为临时堆栈，影响到工具周转率的降低。他如防雨设备的缺乏，装箱技术的不良，都容易造成货物运输事故。又如去年浦口轮渡站桥一度损坏，火车不能原车过江，当时华东联运公司便担任了组织船只的工作，驳运了万余吨物资，长江南北货运才免于停滞，便利了货主，也便利了铁路，更有利于市场。另一方面，跟着物资交流而来的，还有各种押汇、保险、报关、打包、代购代销、旅行社等业务，既为货主所需要，又以其性质复杂，常常成为货主不胜负担的重荷，但联运业务便能以经过专业训练的人员，收极少的手续费用，来满足货主要求，并为货主服务。
    （三）联运业务要将各种分散货源组织与集中。由于我们的生产品是分散的，企业是个别经营的，特别是农村的副业生产，要运到市场，表现在货源的托运上是零杂分散的，必须经过各种不同工具的转驳载运与集中的过程，然后才能以比较经济的运价，使用较近代的工具运到市场。如铁路的整车货运比另担货运，在手续与费用上，要减省得多，但整车托运至少要十五吨，货主常因一次托运的货物数量不多（特别是土产），不能不以另担托运，对于铁路车辆的使用与货主的运费负担来说，两者都有不利。联运业务解除了这个困难，它可以集合各个货主的货物来拼整车，车皮使用率提高，又可减少客运列车附挂另担车。华东联运公司陆运部门的集零拼整的工作，为铁路局上北货站减少了许多麻烦。船运的情况同样也是如此。对于不定期的货轮，个别货主常因托运货物不多，必须在码头或货栈等候很久才能起运，联运业务可以集合许多零星货源，接洽专轮承运大大地节省了时间。
    （四）联运业务可以根据货主们的经常托运纪录汇订运输计划，向运输机构提出托运。为了更有效地支配工具，提高运转效率，各大运输机构都要求货主能事先提出托运计划，但对于较为零星的货运就有困难。联运业务可以通过与货主间的经常联系，掌握货源的动向，考虑各种工具的实际运输能力加以调节配合，制订运输计划，为运输机构解除了这一困难。因此，联运业务的普遍扩展，可以逐步地为计划运输的实现铺平道路。
    （五）联运业务可以经办各专业公司的物资调拨储运业务。如公营盐、煤、粮食、土产、百货等公司都要各自专设大规模的储运机构于各城镇，自办运输，自行管理运输工具，事实上难期完善与熟练。联运公司可以集中经营成为各专业公司的储运部门，达到运输专业化的目的，也可以减少它们的开支和麻烦。
    总之，联运业务，对于运输工具来说，它是近代与落后工具的结合者；对于运输业务来说，它是各种主要与附属业务的综合者；对于货源来说，又是货源从分散到集中的组织者；对于运力与运量的配合来说，又是使工具与货源的结合达到最经济最合理的计划者；对于各专业公司来说，又可以成为它们物资储运业务的集中经营者。只有这样繁复而又细致的运输业务，才能符合目前客观上对运输的要求，才能担负起发展城乡物资交流的重大任务。
            二、谁来办理联运？
    既然明确了联运业务在物资交流中的重要性，那么谁来办理联运业务呢？解放以来，铁路局、轮船公司与汽车运输公司都在办理联运，而且有了一定的成绩。但由于我国运输情况的基本落后与不平衡，一切运输工具与设备，尤其是近代化的交通工具，对于日益庞大的货源来说，显然是供不应求的，只有大力组织各种群众性的落后工具，从乡村到城市，山区到平原，内河到大江，并加以适当地配合与运用，才能满足这一要求。以现有的近代化的运输机构来担负这一任务，必然是一个很重的负担。同时以运输机构兼办联运，不但受着它本身运输条件的限制（自己只掌握一种），即如各种组织货源物资接运转装的手续，必然会妨碍它专心于本身业务，而使重点转移，并且还要造成内部不必要的竞争，抵消了力量。例如皖南运输公司与浙江交通公司，都在屯溪成立货运营业所，招揽茶运，引起了竞争。又如上海区铁路局除与浙江交通公司举办了沪甬线旅客联运等外，在它本身运输力量没有余裕以前，不再多与其他运输机构签订联运合约，以便专心发展铁道事业。再如山东联运业务发展的初期，主要是依靠汽车运输公司的，但跟着联运机构的普遍建设，业务的深入农村，已经不再是一个单独的汽车运输公司所能担负，已开始感到须有一个专业分工的联运机构来办理联运。所以大规模联运业务的开展，就不成熟的经验来说，必须有一个专业化办理联运的机构。
    过去运输业中，私营的转运公司与过塘行、商栈、旅行社等类，占据了一个不小的比重，在沟通城乡关系便利产销的意义上讲，是有着一定的作用的。然而单纯的营利观点与小规模的分散经营，妨碍了它们的进步性。不单是高额利润，收取运输手续费平均在百分之二十以上，增加运输成本，妨碍运销，甚而有不肖分子，如黄牛运输行利用货主对运输的无知进行敲诈舞弊，以图获得非法暴利。同时由于私营转运业本身不能掌握工具，对于货物的委托承运缺乏保证。为了减低运输成本，提高运输效能，保证货物运输的稳妥与迅速，都不能单纯依靠这些私营转运业，而必须有计划有步骤地建设一个国营的联运机构来发展联运，同时只有这样，才能领导、团结与改造这些私营转运业。
    目前人民政府交通部的主要业务是公路与航务，无论从工具的数量与通达范围来讲，二者都是从点到面，联系城乡促进物资交流的有效力量。对于联运业务来说，依靠了公路、航务组织好的工具再进一步地组织与开辟货源，发展的远景是无限广大的。因此，由各区省交通部门设立一个专办联运的机构，在结合工具组织货源上是较为适宜的。第一，由于交通部门掌握了较多种的运输工具，如大小轮船、木帆船、汽车、马车等，以华东来说，有着一九三、五三八吨的内河机动船，一、一○六、六○○吨的内河木帆船，一○、五四一辆的汽车，约一○、○○○辆的人、兽力车辆（指行驶公路的）。可以用作发展联运的有力保证。第二，由于交通部机构深入到各级地方政权，可以充分依靠地方政权，迅速扩大联运网的建设，人力物力上有很大的节省，对于业务扩展有极大的便利。
    综上所述，联运业务的办理方针应该是“工具分别组织，业务集中经营”。这样，才能符合于运输专业化的原则。用联运来减省运输机构的手续，合理地使用运输力量，把联运公司作为所有运输机构的营业部，以达成不以营利为目的，而以为货主及承运机构服务、为城乡物资交流服务为目的。在各地区联运网普遍建立以后，就有可能只要一个电话，一个通知，即将无数种类无数起讫地点的货物迅速地有计划地分运出去，而安全地到达收货人手里。
            三、怎样办理联运？
    华东联运公司成立以后，曾组织了物资的联运工作，取得了一定的成绩，但在具体工作中间，也存在着不少缺点。主要是货源组织工作局限于几个大城市，对于深入农村、照顾全面则是不够的；运用工具，也主要是依靠火车、汽车与轮船，而没有进一步展开对落后工具的结合工作。同时，由于业务不熟练，发生了各种大小事故。因此，今后办理联运必须注意下列各点。
    （一）重视近代工具与落后工具的结合。目前情况是年景丰收，与国家对物资的大量收购运销调节。城乡物资交流的任务日益繁重。运输方面的情况是，一方面铁路、轮运货物拥挤，一方面是分散在农村的物资不能及时运出。这说明了大力组织落后工具是当前的急务。例如华东木帆船的运量就超过全区铁路与长江沿海运量的总和，联运工作者必须对这些广大的落后工具加以重视，充分利用，为沟通城乡的重要武器。
    （二）货源组织必须从城市深入农村。货源主要在农村，工业原料，农产品与工业成品的交流是振兴全国经济的中心环节。联运工作应该一方面密切依靠地方政权，结合地方组织来发展联运网；一方面与国营贸易机构的收购站以及合作社等业务密切配合，深入农村来组织与开辟货源。
    （三）普遍推广合同运输，巩固与扩大货源。正由于合同运输既能符合货主的具体要求，又能适应运输机构的承运能力，因此对于正在成长壮大过程中的联运业务来说，成为巩固并稳步扩展货源的有效方式。山东联运业务的迅速发展，也由于推行合同运输所获得的结果。联运公司一方面可以运用联运合同来联系贸易、合作等物资机构，一方面可以通过运输合同来组织各种工具，与火车、汽车、轮船、木船建立关系，掌握并调配各该运输机构实际的运输力量，编配运输路线与运输计划，进一步为计划运输创造条件。
    （四）善于联系群众，组织货源。组织货源不但要深入农村，并且要善于联系群众，要充分了解各地土产与特产的运路、销路线、数量与价格等情形，要把运输与推销结合起来，在生产机构是“以销定产”，而在联运机构则为“以销定运”，这样才能更好地为群众服务。同时，在组织货源的工作中，宣传工作也是重要的，要利用各种宣传方式告诉群众各地区土产、特产的产销情形与运输方法，要采用各种方法来减轻货物的运销成本，扩大货物的销路，以求进一步地开辟货源。
    （五）精通业务技术，搞好联运工作。运输业务所要长期努力的目标是运得多，运得好，运得快。为了提高运输效率，减低运输成本，必须精通业务技术，熟悉各种工具的性能与作用，不单要学会怎样调查与组织货源，团结货主，还要熟悉运转工作中的一切制度与方法。要学会利用各种新式的机械设备，如吊车绞盘等，使得联运业务不仅是一种繁重的组织工作，而且是一种非常专门的技术工作。
    因此，联运公司是一个经营综合性运输业务的机构。它没有很多工具，但可以运用一切工具，各种货源都可以通过它来组织与分配，分别由各个运输机构来承运，圆满地完成任务。它是运输的最好的组织者。只有联运业务的普遍发展，才能使生产者努力于生产。只有各运输机构专心于本身业务，才能使城乡物资交流的任务顺利完成。
