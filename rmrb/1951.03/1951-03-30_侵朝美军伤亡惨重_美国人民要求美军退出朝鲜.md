Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th dispatch from Telecommunications Agency: The heavy casualties suffered by the US troops invading Korea have further deepened the American people's dissatisfaction with the US imperialists' war of aggression against Korea. US President Truman has recently received many letters from groups and individuals demanding that US troops withdraw from Korea and end this massacre.

The American ruling clique is deeply worried about this. US Secretary of State Acheson and Secretary of Defense Marshall, with Truman's approval, have instructed MacArthur to try to reduce US troop casualties as much as possible. They said that the percentage of US military casualties is much higher than the percentage of casualties of any country's army fighting in Korea. They suggested that, except in special circumstances, US troops should generally not be sent to the front line for missions or reconnaissance. Acheson and Marshall further advised MacArthur to concentrate on improving propaganda work in the army, because the pessimistic news constantly coming from the front has aroused dissatisfaction among the American people.

[Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: Newspapers across the United States are receiving more and more letters to the editor opposing the Korean War and the atrocities of US troops in Korea. According to the New York Worker's Daily: The Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina published a letter to the editor signed by "Big Swain," which stated in part: "Now, the whole world wants peace, except for a small handful of imperialists. They love war, but they are unwilling to fight in person. They want to send our children, while they stay at home, gorging on their plunder. "The time has come, if we want America to exist, the American people must take a tough stance against the government. The danger is not a foreign enemy, but right here at home."

The Winston-Salem Journal also published another letter to the editor signed "Bakham." It wrote: "Our children are dying every day to enslave Koreans. Mr. America, how many more children do you want to sacrifice to enslave Korea?"

　　侵朝美军伤亡惨重
    美国人民要求美军退出朝鲜
    【新华社二十九日讯】据电通社华盛顿二十七日讯：侵朝美军伤亡惨重，使美国人民对美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的战争的不满更为加深。美国总统杜鲁门最近接到许多团体和个人的信件，要求美军退出朝鲜，结束这场屠杀。
    美国统治集团对此深为忧虑。美国国务卿艾奇逊和国防部长马歇尔在得到杜鲁门批准后，已训令麦克阿瑟尽量设法减少美军的伤亡。他们说，美军伤亡的百分比，比在朝鲜作战的任何国家军队的伤亡百分比高得多。他们建议，除特殊情形外，一般不应派遣美军担任前线任务和进行侦察。艾奇逊和马歇尔进而劝告麦克阿瑟集中力量改进军队中的宣传工作，因为不断从前线传来的悲观消息，引起了美国人民的不满情绪。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国各地报纸收到愈来愈多的读者投书，反对朝鲜战争和美军在朝鲜的暴行。据纽约工人日报报道：北卡罗来纳州温斯顿——萨兰日报发表了一封署名大斯温的投书，其中略称：现在，全世界都要和平，只有一小撮帝国主义者除外。他们嗜好战争，但是他们却不愿亲自去打仗。他们要派我们的孩子们去，而他们却留在家里，大嚼其掠夺品。“现在是时候了，如果我们还要美国存在下去，美国人民必须对政府态度强硬起来。危险不是外国敌人，而正在我们国内。”
    温斯顿——萨兰日报还发表了另一署名白克翰的投书。其中写道：“我们的孩子们每天都有人为奴役朝鲜人而死去。请问美国先生，你究竟有多少孩子要他们为奴役朝鲜而牺牲呢？”
