    A Good Example of an Honorably Discharged Veteran
    Wu Xianhai is from Sijiao Caomen Village, Zhulin Township, Sidian District, Xin County, Henan Province. He was from a poor peasant family and worked as a hired hand from a young age. At the age of fifteen, he joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. After eighteen years of revolutionary struggle, he shed blood several times for the Party and the people. Last March, he was discharged from the army and returned home due to poor health. Because Wu Xianhai led the masses in fighting drought and floods with merit over the past year, he was selected as a special-class labor model in the prefecture. His noble quality of not resting on his laurels and actively serving the people is a good example for honorably discharged veterans.
    Last April, the area was hit by a severe drought. He was the first to respond to the government's call to fight the drought, opened up the masses' thinking, and took the lead in drawing water for twenty days and fifteen nights. He also organized water-drawing groups of three to eight waterwheels, saving eighteen *shi* of rice seedlings. In addition, his own seven *dou* of fields had no pond water, so he carried more than 2,000 loads of water in five days, preventing the seedlings from drying out and overcoming the disaster. Because of his diligent farming and humble learning of production techniques, his two *shi* of fields yielded eighteen *shi* more rice.
    Last June, heavy rain caused flooding, and a breach was washed out of the river dam in his township. He immediately summoned the masses to the dam to block the gap, but the water was very rapid. At the most dangerous moment, the river dam was eroded by the flood, leaving only five inches of thickness. The whole village was panicked, but he calmly encouraged everyone to persist in the struggle against the flood, using doors, branches, grass, and sandbags to block it together. As a result, they overcame the fierce flood and rescued more than 200 people from five villages and more than 30 *shi* of good fields.

### 荣誉退伍军人的一个好榜样

　　荣誉退伍军人的一个好榜样
    吴先海是河南新县四店区竹林乡四角曹门村人，贫农成份，从小就给人家帮工，十五岁时加入了当时的工农红军。经过十八年革命斗争的锻炼，曾为党为人民几次流血。去年三月间因为身体过弱退伍回家。因为吴先海一年来带领群众抗旱防洪有功，当选为专区特等劳动模范。他这种不以功自居，积极为人民服务的高尚品质，正是荣誉退伍军人的一个好榜样。
    在去年四月间，当地闹着严重的旱灾。他首先响应了政府抗旱的号召，打通群众思想，带头车了二十天十五夜的水，又组织三挂车到八挂车的车水小组，救出了十八石田的秧。另外，他自己的七斗田没有塘水，就在五天内担了二千多担水，使秧苗未被干死，战胜了灾荒。由于他勤劳耕作，虚心学习生产技术，他的二石田多收了十八石稻。
    去年六月间，雨水成灾，本乡河道的水堰被洪水冲开了一个缺口，他立即召集群众上堰堵口，但水势很急，最危险时河堰被洪水冲刷仅余五寸厚。全村人惊慌万状，但他却镇静的鼓励大家坚持向洪水作斗争，用门板、树枝、草、沙袋一齐堵，结果战胜了凶猛的洪水，救出了五个村二百多人，三十多石好田。
