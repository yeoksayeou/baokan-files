"Gate No. 6" Performed in Beijing

The Tianjin Dockworkers' Amateur Performing Arts Troupe, at the invitation of the National Committee of the Chinese Dockworkers' Union, performed the drama "Gate No. 6" (also known as "The Story of Dockworkers' Emancipation") in Beijing. It was well received by the Beijing literary and artistic circles, Beijing dockworkers, and cadres from various organizations. The play vividly and realistically portrays the lives of Tianjin dockworkers before and after liberation and how they overthrew the feudal foremen under the leadership of the Communist Party. This is of great guiding significance for the nationwide anti-feudal foreman movement. The play was performed more than 60 times in Tianjin and Tanggu, and was widely welcomed by the working masses, playing a huge role in uniting and educating workers in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The play was created and performed by Tianjin dockworkers with the help of professional literary and artistic groups such as the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The success of the play shows that the working class has the talent for literary and artistic creation and that the path of collective creation by literary and artistic workers and workers, peasants, and soldiers is correct. The troupe plans to revise some shortcomings in the play, such as a lack of conciseness, after widely absorbing opinions from all parties. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government will send a special person to participate in the guidance.

Popular Versions of World-Renowned Literary Works

Rewriting world-renowned literary works into popular versions can help promote literature and art if done well. Recently, some bookstores have paid attention to this work and published many such literary and artistic books. Among them, several books rewritten by the Shanghai Tonglian Bookstore in the style of chapters and episodes are worth noting. The already published works include "How the Steel Was Tempered" (rewritten based on Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered"), "Chapayev" (rewritten based on Furmanov's "Chapayev"), "Bitter Sea Turns into Paradise" (rewritten based on Konstantin Paustovsky's "Kara-Bugaz Gulf"), "Rainbow in the Snow" (rewritten based on Wanda Wasilewska's "Rainbow"), etc. Although these rewritten versions still have some shortcomings individually (such as overly exaggerated descriptions, etc.), they generally make good use of the characteristics of chapter novels: clear language, tense stories, compact structure, and clear explanation of plots; at the same time, they do not lose the original meaning and correctly grasp the original works' thoughts and feelings. This rewriting method will be loved by the vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, and urban readers. If a large number are printed and sold and promoted to book stalls, it is possible to win over some readers of old chapter novels.

Slide Shows Welcomed by Farmers in Shanxi

Eighty-nine of the ninety-two counties in Shanxi Province have established slide show projection teams. According to incomplete statistics, last year, slides were shown in rural areas of various counties more than 3,000 times, with an audience of more than 2 million people.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education, the Fine Arts Workers Association, and the cultural centers of various counties actively organize the creation and projection of slide pictures. The content of the slide pictures focuses on political current events and current work. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, various places produced more than 150 sets of current affairs propaganda pictures with "The History of American Imperialism's Aggression Against China" and the Resist America, Aid Korea activities as the central content, totaling more than 2,300 pictures. Slide shows have also achieved good results in spreading advanced production experiences, banning reactionary secret societies, exposing counter-revolutionary rumors, and promoting maternal and infant hygiene. Some of the slides shown in various places are brightly colored and accompanied by music, sound effects, and allegro explanations, becoming films with sound, color, and stories, which farmers love even more.

　　国内文艺动态
   “六号门”在北京演出
    天津市搬运工人业余文工团应中国搬运工会全国委员会之邀，来北京演出的话剧“六号门”（一名“搬运工人翻身记”），获得了北京文艺界、北京搬运工人和各机关团体干部的好评。因为该剧生动而真实地表现了天津搬运工人在解放前后的两种生活和他们怎样在共产党的领导下，打倒了封建把头。这对全国反封建把持运动，有很大的指导意义。该剧曾在天津、塘沽演出六十多场，受到工人群众的普遍欢迎，在团结教育工人进行镇压反革命工作中起了极大的作用。该剧是天津搬运工人在天津市文联等专业文艺团体的帮助下创作和演出的。该剧的成功，一方面说明了工人阶级具有文艺创作的才能，一方面也说明了文艺工作者和工农兵集体创作道路的正确。对剧中的某些缺点，如不精炼等，该团准备在广泛吸收各方面的意见之后，再加修改，中央人民政府文化部将派专人参加指导。
    通俗本的世界文艺名著
    把世界名著改写成通俗本，如果改写的好，这对文艺的普及工作上是有帮助的。最近若干书店已经注意这一工作，而且出版了不少这样的文艺书。其中上海通联书店用章回小说体改写的几本，是值得注意的。已经出版的有《百炼成钢》（根据奥斯托洛夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》改写的）、《夏伯阳》、（根据富曼诺夫的《夏伯阳》改写的）、《苦海变乐园》（根据康斯坦丁·帕斯托夫斯基的《卡腊·布迦日海湾》改写的）、《雪地长虹》（根据瓦希列夫斯卡的《虹》改写的）等。这些改写本，虽然个别的还存在了一些缺点（如过分夸张的描写等），但一般地说，是很能利用了章回小说的特点：文字明快，故事紧张，结构紧凑，情节交代的清楚；同时，又不失原意，正确地掌握了原著的思想感情，这种改写方法，是会为广大的工农兵及市民读者所喜欢的。如果大量印销，推广到书摊中去，是可以争取一部分旧章回小说的读者的。
    山西放映幻灯受到农民欢迎
    山西省全省九十二县中已有八十九县建立了幻灯放映队。据不完全统计，去年一年内，幻灯在各县农村巡回放映共三千多次，观众达二百余万人。
    山西省人民政府文教厅、美术工作者协会和各县文化馆都积极组织幻灯画片的创作与放映工作。幻灯画片的内容都以政治时事和当前工作为中心。在抗美援朝运动中，各地以“美帝侵华史”和抗美援朝活动为中心内容制成的时事宣传画片有一百五十多套，共二千三百多幅。在传播先进生产经验、取缔反动会门、揭穿反革命谣言和提倡妇婴卫生等工作方面，放映幻灯片也收到很好的成效。各地放映的幻灯片中有些色彩鲜艳，并配以音乐声响快板说明，成为有声、有色又有故事的影片，农民们对这些影片更加喜爱。
