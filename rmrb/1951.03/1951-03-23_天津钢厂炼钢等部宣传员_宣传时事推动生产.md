Tianjin Steel Plant Steelmaking and Other Departments' Propagandists
    Promote Current Affairs and Drive Production
    Qiao Zhaoqing
    The propagandists of the Tianjin Steel Plant's Steelmaking Department were established in June of last year, and the propagandists of the Electromechanical Department were established in October of last year. The establishment of propagandists in both departments was determined after the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the administration, with the consent of the individuals themselves. After establishment, a reorganization was carried out, removing a small number of ineffective propagandists and absorbing those who were cultivated in normal times, making the propagandist ranks more neat and consolidated. Currently, propagandists in the Steelmaking Department account for one-tenth of the total number of employees, and propagandists in the Electromechanical Department account for one-eighth of the total number of employees. The Tianjin Steel Plant Steelmaking Department branch of the Communist Party of China also stipulates that a propagandist conference be held once a month, a joint meeting of group leaders once a week to report on and study the work of the propagandists, and specialized study of propaganda business every two weeks. The various systems of propagandist work in the Electromechanical Department are similar to those of the Steelmaking Department, except that the department also stipulates reading newspapers twice a week.

    Since the establishment of propagandists in the Tianjin Steel Plant's Steelmaking Department and Electromechanical Department, they have played a significant role in propaganda and mobilization in movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, patriotic production competitions, and suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. For example, in July of last year, at the end of the city-wide production competition in the Steelmaking Department, problems suddenly arose in the Martin furnace, which greatly affected the morale of the workers. At this time, the Party branch immediately convened a meeting of propagandists to discuss this issue. Then, the propagandists explained to the workers that this was not because everyone was not working hard, but because of the furnace itself, and that as long as everyone strengthened their technical learning, we would have a way to overcome this difficulty. At the same time, the propagandists guided everyone to study technology and shorten the furnace repair time. In this way, the morale of the workers rose again. In October of last year, the propagandists of the Steelmaking Department discovered that one-third of the department's annual production task had not yet been completed, and immediately mobilized the workers to resolve to ensure completion on schedule, and also paid special attention to preventing accidents. In November, they again encouraged workers to launch a patriotic production competition, and later finally completed the 1950 production task ahead of schedule. In December of last year, when the State Council of the Central People's Government called on young workers and students across the country to participate in military cadre schools, the propagandists of the Electromechanical Department actively carried out propaganda activities, making everyone more deeply aware of the importance of "participating in military cadre schools and building national defense." One worker said, "Consolidating national defense is like building a wall, otherwise, robbers can come in at any time, and good days cannot be guaranteed." They also realized that "today the working class is the leading class of the country, and the modern national defense military technology must be mastered by our class brothers." When the workers who participated in the military cadre schools departed, the workers in the factory unanimously expressed: "They will practice their skills to defend the country, and we must increase production to strengthen national defense." In late January of this year, under the encouragement of propagandists, the Electromechanical Department took the lead in "responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group." Currently, the propagandists are concentrating their efforts on publicizing opposition to the United States' arming of Japan. Under the leadership of the propagandists, trade union group meetings have often become forums for workers to accuse the Japanese invaders of their atrocities. Many employees of the Tianjin Steel Plant have personally suffered from the persecution of the Japanese invaders, and there is no end to their hatred. Many workers wrote down their hatred and submitted it to the blackboard newspaper and the Tianjin Steel Plant newspaper for publication, and some workers even asked to go to the radio station to accuse the Japanese invaders of the personal persecution they suffered in the past.

    The reason why the propagandist work of these two departments can play such a large role is primarily because the propagandists can lead by example in production and political activities, and extensively connect with the masses. In their six months of propaganda work, they have gained the following experiences:

    First, the branch grasps the central tasks of each period and unifies the deployment of propaganda work, so the content, methods, and steps of propaganda can be consistent. When the State Council of the Central People's Government called on young workers and students to participate in military cadre schools, some people thought: "This is a matter for Party members and members of the Communist Youth League." The trade union immediately cooperated to educate the workers, explaining that this is a matter for every patriotic youth with blood, and as a result, many young workers enthusiastically signed up. In this way, the propaganda work has achieved good results. At the same time, due to mutual assistance between various systems, the various meeting systems of the propagandists can be adhered to.

    Second, in propaganda, it is possible to link every production task with national construction and the current political situation. Therefore, the patriotic production competition movement was naturally launched. Currently, in the propaganda against the United States' arming of Japan, workers are also mobilized to jointly formulate patriotic covenants for individuals and groups. Such propaganda, on the one hand, promoted the production movement, and on the other hand, rapidly improved the political awareness of employees.

    Third, attention is paid to commendation and criticism in propaganda. Therefore, the ideological nature of propaganda work is stronger. Commend good workers so that everyone can learn from them. Criticize workers who make mistakes to make everyone vigilant. As soon as this worker makes some progress, his progress is commended on the wall newspaper, while pointing out that he should continue to work hard to correct his mistakes. When propagandists make mistakes, they are also subject to open criticism and self-criticism.

    Fourth, oral propaganda is combined with written propaganda. Propagandists often use individual talks, informal discussions, and various meetings to conduct oral propaganda. The Electromechanical Department has organized newspaper reading groups, which can regularly unite fifty people to listen to newspaper readings. Written propaganda mainly includes blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, Tianjin Steel Plant newspapers, and slogans. They also coordinate the use of oral and written propaganda, and the propaganda effect is greater. For example, after a counter-revolutionary element in the factory was arrested, the newspaper reading group selected articles on the combination of suppression and leniency in the Tianjin Daily and read them to everyone. After listening, the workers said: "These bad guys should have been arrested long ago." At this time, the blackboard newspaper announced a list of bad elements who should be controlled, so that these people, under the supervision of the masses, did not dare to talk nonsense. Propagandists also often go to the factory's radio station to broadcast. The role of this propaganda activity is not limited to the department's workshop, and it affects the entire factory.

    However, there are still some problems in the propagandist work of the Tianjin Steel Plant: for example, the Party's general branch committee can only make principled arrangements for the propaganda work of the departments and workshops, and it is still very poor at grasping the situation and instructing the propaganda activities of the propagandists. This keeps the role of propagandists in their own workshops for a long time, and they cannot be systematically promoted to the entire factory. At the same time, from the perspective of the requirements of propaganda work, the level of propagandists needs to be continuously cultivated and improved. However, there is also a lack of propaganda materials and learning materials suitable for workers, which also poses practical difficulties for cultivating and educating propagandists, and the Party of the factory should try its best to solve these problems.

### 天津钢厂炼钢等部宣传员  宣传时事推动生产

　　天津钢厂炼钢等部宣传员
    宣传时事推动生产
    乔昭庆
    天津钢厂炼钢部的宣传员是去年六月建立的，机电部宣传员是去年十月建立的。该两部宣传员的建立都是在党领导与行政协助下，经其本人同意后，才确定为宣传员的。建立以后，又进行过一次整理，将少数不起作用的宣传员刷洗出去；又把平时培养的对象吸收进来，使宣传员的队伍更加整齐与巩固。现在，炼钢部宣传员占全部职工总数十分之一，机电部宣传员占全部职工总数的八分之一。中共天津钢厂炼钢部支部并规定每月开宣传员大会一次，每周开小组长联席会一次，汇报研究宣传员工作，每两周专门学习宣传业务一次。机电部宣传员工作的各种制度与炼钢部的相似，只是该部还规定每周读报两次。
    天津钢厂炼钢部与机电部的宣传员建立以来，在抗美援朝保家卫国、爱国主义生产竞赛及镇压反革命活动等运动中，都起了很大的宣传鼓动作用。例如去年七月，炼钢部全市生产大竞赛末期，马丁炉忽然发生了问题，影响工人生产情绪很大。这时党支部上立即召开宣传员会，讨论这一问题。然后再由宣传员向工人群众去说明这不是大家不努力，而是炉子本身的问题，只要大家加强技术学习，我们有办法来克服这一困难的。同时宣传员又引导大家钻研技术，缩短修炉时间。这样工人群众情绪才又高涨起来。去年十月，炼钢部宣传员发现本部全年生产任务尚有三分之一未完成，立即动员工人群众下决心保证按期完成，又特别使大家注意防止事故。到十一月又鼓动工友开展爱国主义生产竞赛，后来终于提前完成了一九五○年的生产任务。去年十二月，中央人民政府政务院号召全国青年工人与学生参加军事干部学校时，机电部宣传员又积极进行宣传活动，使大家更深刻地认识了“参加军事干部学校，建设国防”的重要意义。有个工人就说：“巩固国防就像建筑一座围墙，否则，强盗随时可以进来，好日子就保不住。”又认识到“今天工人是国家的领导阶级，现代化的国防军事技术，本阶级弟兄必须掌握。”当欢送参加军事干部学校的工人出发时，在厂的工人一致表示：“他们去练习本事保卫国家，我们一定要增加生产，增强国防。”今年一月下旬，机电部在宣传员鼓动下，首先“向马恒昌小组应战”。目前，宣传员又集中力量宣传反对美帝国主义武装日本。在宣传员带头下，工会小组会，往往变成了工人群众的控诉日寇暴行的座谈会。天津钢厂有很多职工亲身受过日寇的迫害，有诉不完的仇恨，许多工人把自己的仇恨写出来投给黑板报和津钢小报发表，还有的工友要求到电台去控诉过去亲身遭受日寇迫害的情形。
    这两部的宣传员工作所以能够发挥这样大的作用，首先是因为宣传员能够在生产上和政治活动上以身作则，和广泛地联系群众。他们在半年多的宣传工作中，已获得如下几点经验：
    第一，支部掌握每一个时期的中心任务，统一布置宣传工作，因此宣传内容、方法、步骤均能一致。当中央人民政府政务院号召青年工人与学生参加军事干部学校时，曾有一些人认为：“这是党团员的事。”工会立即配合对工人群众进行教育，说明这是每一个有血气的爱国青年的事情，结果就有不少青年工人踊跃报名。这样宣传工作就收到很好的效果。同时，由于各系统互相协助，宣传员的各种会议制度得以坚持。
    第二，在宣传中，能够把每一件生产工作都联系着国家建设和当前的政治形势。因此，很自然地发动了爱国主义生产竞赛运动。目前在宣传反对美帝国主义武装日本中，又发动工人群众共同订立了个人与小组的爱国公约。这样的宣传，一方面推动了生产运动，另一方面迅速地提高了职工的政治觉悟。
    第三，宣传中注意了表扬与批评。因此宣传工作的思想性更加强烈。表扬好的工友，使大家向他学习。对于犯错误的工友进行批评，使大家警惕。一等这个工友有些进步，就在墙报上一面表扬他的进步，同时指出应继续努力改正自己错误。宣传员犯了错误时，同样进行公开的批评和检讨。
    第四，口头宣传与文字宣传结合。宣传员经常采用个别谈话，不定型座谈与通过各种会议，进行口头宣传。机电部就组织了读报组，能经常团结五十来个人来听读报。文字宣传主要有黑板报、大字报、津钢小报和标语等。他们并把口头宣传与文字宣传配合运用，宣传效果更大。例如厂里有一个反革命分子被逮捕后，读报组就及时选择天津日报上的镇压与宽大相结合问题的文章读给大家听。工人群众听了之后都说：“早就该把这些坏家伙扣起来了。”此时黑板报又公布了应该管制的一批坏分子的名单，使这些人在群众监督下，不敢再乱说乱动。宣传员还常到厂里的电台去广播。这种宣传活动的作用就不仅限于本部车间，并影响到全厂。
    但是目前天津钢厂宣传员工作还存在一些问题：例如党的总支委员会对部与车间的宣传工作，还只能作原则的布置，对于掌握情况，指示宣传员的宣传活动还很差。这就使宣传员的作用长期停留在自己车间，不能有计划地推广到全厂。同时从宣传工作的要求来看，宣传员的水平需要继续培养与提高。但是又缺乏工人适用的宣传资料与学习材料，这也给培养教育宣传员以实际困难，该厂党应极力设法解决这些问题。
