　　Dynamics of Resisting America and Aiding Korea
　　The Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in the Northwest Region
　　The movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in the Northwest Region has developed considerably in the larger and some smaller cities. As of March 11th, according to incomplete statistics, more than 600,000 people in more than 20 cities, including Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Dihua, have participated in patriotic rallies and demonstrations to resist America and aid Korea. Some ethnic minority areas and rural areas have also been drawn into this struggle. Through rallies and demonstrations, the political awareness of the broad masses has been raised a step further. In particular, the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea and the victory of our representative Wu Xiuquan in the UN General Assembly have greatly enhanced the patriotic sentiment of the people. Some people quoted classics and said: "I have not found in the history of the past three hundred years that the Chinese people can defeat foreigners. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, I have seen it with my own eyes." Wherever the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has penetrated in the Northwest Region, whether in cities or villages, all kinds of work have gained momentum.
　　However, the patriotic movement in the vast rural areas and many small cities in the Northwest is still not developed enough, and some villages do not even know what Resisting America and Aiding Korea is all about. In large and medium-sized cities, the situation is better in government agencies, schools, and factories, but worse in other sectors. Ethnic minority areas are also doing relatively poorly. Therefore, it is still necessary to make great efforts to promote the development of this movement in areas and sectors where it has not yet developed or is not sufficiently developed.
　　Some Rural Areas in Southwest China Have Launched the Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea
　　The movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in the Southwest Region has developed to some rural areas. As of the end of February, more than 250,000 farmers in the region had participated in anti-American patriotic demonstrations. The farmers in the vast rural areas of eastern Sichuan, who are undergoing the struggle to reduce rent and return deposits, are very indignant when they learn that American imperialism has invaded Korea and attempted to invade our country. They said: American devils and Chiang Kai-shek and the landlords wear the same pair of pants. To resist America and aid Korea, it is necessary to defeat the landlord class. Many farmers have pledged to invest all the fruits of rent reduction and deposit refunds into production, produce more grain, build a new country, and consolidate national defense. In some places, farmers' associations have subscribed to newspapers to enhance farmers' understanding of the current situation, and farmers are very enthusiastic about studying current affairs. In Da Ying Township, Pengxi County, northern Sichuan, the total population of the township is more than 25,000, and as many as 20,000 people participated in patriotic demonstrations to resist America and aid Korea, accounting for four-fifths of the township's population. In Nanchong and Suining counties, 30,000 farmers volunteered to sign up and requested to go to the forefront of the struggle. In the rural areas of Southwest China, wherever the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has been deeply developed, the farmers' political awareness has been greatly enhanced, the work of reducing rent and returning deposits has been carried out smoothly, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production has been very high. The current problem is to universally launch this patriotic movement.
　　Heilongjiang Province Attaches Importance to Propaganda in the Patriotic Movement
　　Heilongjiang Province has attached considerable importance to current affairs propaganda in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. Since December of last year, it has shifted to a regular current affairs propaganda movement. Before November of last year, Heilongjiang Province organized more than 5,000 propagandists in cities and relied on district and village cadres to organize more than 36,000 propagandists in rural areas. The Heilongjiang Provincial Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association has also compiled and reprinted 300,000 copies of various pamphlets and leaflets. At the same time, the province's propaganda to Resist America and Aid Korea is combined with various practical tasks. For example, propaganda to Resist America and Aid Korea in factories focuses on carrying out patriotic production competitions. In rural areas, propaganda to Resist America and Aid Korea is combined with production and marketing, and the propaganda of strengthening the great unity of poor and middle peasants is strengthened. Therefore, the propaganda and education movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has greatly promoted all aspects of work.
　　The main experiences of Heilongjiang Province in propaganda to Resist America and Aid Korea are:
　　(1) The consistent cooperation of various mass organizations and cultural and educational propaganda departments, coupled with the large-scale recruitment of reporters to serve the propaganda movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, has formed a strong propaganda force and is appropriately distributed in cities and villages to conduct current affairs propaganda and education for each period in combination with different specific work.
　　(2) Conducting propaganda through speech contests, report meetings, and accusation meetings to compare the past and the present is the most practical and profound propaganda. After these gatherings, the people's hatred of the United States and love for the country were greatly enhanced.
　　(3) Propaganda through various art forms is most popular among the masses. Propaganda posters, comic strips, cartoons, concise charts, drums, foreign films, clapper talks, cross talks, etc., generally achieve considerable results. The production charts newly created by factories to record the daily production quantity and quality of individuals or groups are very popular among employees and greatly encourage patriotic production competitions and profoundly and vividly educate the masses.
　　Guangzhou is Strengthening Current Affairs Propaganda
　　As reported in this column before, the patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has achieved many successes in Guangzhou, but the development is still uneven. In many factories, resisting America and aiding Korea is not closely linked to production competitions, there is insufficient systematic propaganda and education among unorganized citizens, some dead corners in the movement have not been broken through, or although they have been initially broken through, ideological problems have not yet been resolved. For those movements that have been carried out vigorously, it is necessary to go one step further in order to consolidate and improve the results of the movement and transform patriotic awareness and enthusiasm into concrete patriotic forces. For workers and their families, in particular, regular and systematic anti-American patriotic ideological education should be carried out.
　　To this end, the Guangzhou leadership has decided to strengthen current affairs propaganda and education, launch the struggle against the US arming of Japan, and universally conclude patriotic covenants as the three centers for the continued development of the anti-American patriotic movement in Guangzhou.

　　抗美援朝动态
    西北区的抗美援朝运动
    西北区的抗美援朝运动在比较大的和一部分小的城市，已经有了相当大的发展。迄三月十一日止，据不完全统计，已有西安、兰州、迪化等二十多个城市共六十多万人参加了抗美援朝爱国集会和示威游行。并有部分少数民族地区及农村卷入这一斗争。经过集会和示威游行，广大人民群众的政治觉悟提高了一步。特别是中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的胜利，我伍修权代表在联合国大会斗争的胜利，使人民群众的爱国情绪大为提高。有的人引经据典地说：“中国人能打败外国人，我在三百年以来历史上都没有找到，今天，在中国共产党的领导下，我亲眼看到了。”西北区凡是抗美援朝运动深入的地方，无论城市或农村，各种工作都有了劲。
    但爱国运动在西北的广大农村和很多小城市还发展得很不够，甚至有的乡村还不知道抗美援朝是怎么回事。大中城市中，机关、学校、工厂好一些，其他阶层差一些。少数民族地区做得也比较差。因此，还必须用极大努力在尚未发展或尚不充分发展的地区和阶层中推动这一运动的发展。
  西南部分农村已开展抗美援朝运动
    西南区的抗美援朝运动已发展到部分农村。截至二月底止，全区已有二十五万以上的农民参加了反美爱国示威游行。正在进行减租退押斗争的川东广大农村的农民，在知道美国帝国主义侵入朝鲜企图侵略我国时，都非常愤慨。他们说：美国鬼子与蒋介石和地主是穿一条裤子，要抗美援朝，必需打垮地主阶级。许多农民保证将减租退押的全部果实投入生产，多打粮食，建设新国家和巩固国防。有的地方的农会为提高农民对时局的认识，订了报纸，农民学习时事很起劲。川北蓬溪县大英乡，全乡总人口二万五千余，参加抗美援朝爱国示威游行的即达两万人，占该乡人口五分之四。而南充、遂宁两县即有三万农民志愿报名，要求到斗争的最前线去。西南区的农村，凡深入开展了抗美援朝运动的，农民政治觉悟大为提高，减租退押工作进行得很顺利，农民生产情绪也十分高涨。目前的问题是使这一爱国运动普遍地展开。
  黑龙江省在爱国运动中重视宣传工作
    黑龙江省在抗美援朝运动中相当重视时事宣传工作，自去年十二月以来，即已转入经常性的时事宣传运动。黑龙江省在去年十一月前在城市中组织了五千多宣传员，在农村中依靠区村干部组织了三万六千多宣传员。黑龙江省抗美援朝分会并编写和翻印了三十万份各种小册子和传单。同时，该省的抗美援朝宣传都与各项实际工作相结合。如工厂抗美援朝的宣传集中于开展爱国生产竞赛。在农村中宣传抗美援朝与生产供销等相结合，并加强贫雇中农大团结的宣传。因此，抗美援朝宣传教育运动，对各方面的工作起了很大推动作用。
    黑龙江省抗美援朝宣传的主要经验是：
    （一）各群众团体与文教宣传部门的一致配合，又加上大批征集了为抗美援朝宣传运动服务的报告员，形成了强大的宣传队伍，并且适当地分布在城市、农村中，结合不同的具体工作进行每个时期的时事宣传教育。
    （二）通过讲演比赛、报告会、控诉会，进行今昔的对比的宣传，这是最实际深刻的宣传。经过这些集会，大大提高了人民群众仇美爱国的情绪。
    （三）通过各种艺术形式进行宣传，最受群众欢迎。宣传画、连环画、漫画、简明图表、大鼓、洋片、快板、相声等，一般都能收到相当的效果。工厂新创造的纪录个人或小组每日生产数量质量的生产图表，很受职工欢迎，大大鼓舞了爱国的生产竞赛，深刻生动地教育了群众。
  广州市正在加强时事宣传
    如本刊本栏以前所报道，抗美援朝爱国运动在广州已获得许多成绩，但是发展还不平衡。不少工厂中抗美援朝和生产竞赛未能密切结合，在无组织的市民中系统的宣传教育不够，运动中的死角有些还未突破，或虽已初步突破而思想问题尚未解决。一般轰轰烈烈开展了运动的还要使它深入一步，以便巩固和提高运动的成果，使爱国的认识和热情转化为具体的爱国力量。对于工人和工人家属，特别应该进行经常的、系统的反美爱国思想教育。
    为此，广州市领导机关已决定以加强时事宣传教育，展开反对美国武装日本的斗争和普遍订立爱国公约作为广州人民继续开展的反美爱国运动的三个中心。
