Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: According to statistics from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression as of February 27th, the committee has received a total of 43,800,456,441 yuan in Renminbi from across the country for comforting the Chinese and Korean People's fighters and providing relief to Korean refugees. In addition, according to incomplete statistics reported by the committee's branches to the general committee, a total of 532,305 comfort bags, 712,795 comfort items, and 725,879 comfort letters have been received, most of which have been sent to the Korean front.

Xinhua News Agency: Overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese continue to enthusiastically comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

The Shantou branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression recently received a comfort fund of 192 Thai baht (equivalent to more than 194,000 yuan in Renminbi) and a comfort letter from a group of elementary school students from a Chinese school in Thailand to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The letter stated: "We hope that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will eliminate more American imperialist aggressors, so that American imperialism and its lackeys will no longer dare to act recklessly and persecute overseas Chinese."

Two hundred and ten overseas Chinese who returned from Thailand this month donated 2,500 Thai baht on the ship to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces.

In January, more than 200 overseas Chinese who returned from Malaya also established a Donation Working Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country on the ship, raising 643 Malayan dollars and 35 Hong Kong dollars to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In their letter of comfort to the Volunteer Army, they wrote: "We, like our compatriots in the motherland, cannot tolerate the crazy aggression of American imperialism against China and Korea; we vow to be your strong backing."
