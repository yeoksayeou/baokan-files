To the Editor:

The Tongbei County Trade Union Committee in Heilongjiang Province does not conduct thorough leadership work, rendering the lower-level branch organizations merely symbolic. For example, the chairman and members of the county trade union have never visited the lower-level branches. To understand the situation, they simply summon the branch chairmen to the county trade union for a brief discussion. There is even less specific assistance and guidance for the various branches, resulting in extremely unsound lower-level organizations. For example, the role of the department store employee branch is minimal. The branch chairman did not convey the significance of the meeting after returning from a conference in the province. The culture and education committee member does not care about the cultural learning of employees. Most employees have not joined the trade union, and the trade union does not pay attention to them. As a result, the trade union's prestige among the masses is low, members are unwilling to pay membership dues, and some even request to withdraw from the union. Based on the above situation, we suggest that the county trade union leadership go deep into the grassroots, understand the situation, and help the lower-level branches to improve their work in order to consolidate and expand the trade union organization.

　　通北县工会组织不起作用编辑同志：
    黑龙江省通北县工会委员会领导工作不深入，使下级分会组织徒具形式。如县工会主席及委员从来没有到过下级分会。要了解情况，只是把分会主席叫到县工会谈一下就完了。对各分会的具体帮助和指导更谈不上，因此下级组织极不健全。如百货公司店员分会作用就不大，分会主席到省开会回来也不传达开会意义；文教委员不关心职工文化学习；大部职工没有参加工会，工会也不理睬他们，因此工会在群众中的威信不高，会员不愿拿会费，甚至有的要求退会。根据以上情况，我们建议县工会领导应深入下层，了解情况，帮助把下级分会搞好工作，才能巩固与扩大工会组织。
