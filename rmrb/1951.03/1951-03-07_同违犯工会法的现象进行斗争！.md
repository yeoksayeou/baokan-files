　　Struggle Against Phenomena Violating the Trade Union Law!
　　Editor's Note: Currently, the "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China"—an important national law—is being poorly implemented in many places. Some administrative leaders of state-owned enterprises often mistakenly believe that the Trade Union Law is only a matter for the trade union and has little to do with the administration; therefore, they adopt an attitude of indifference. Some capitalists in private enterprises ignore the rights of workers stipulated in the Trade Union Law and continue to abuse workers with various oppressive means from feudal society. These phenomena that violate the Trade Union Law cannot be tolerated. Trade unions and government labor departments in various regions should systematically inspect the implementation of the Trade Union Law, correctly handle public-private and labor-capital relations, and all issues in workers' lives; expose all erroneous phenomena that violate the Trade Union Law. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct serious publicity and education on the Trade Union Law for cadres and the masses. Trade union organizations and the worker masses must stand on the correct position and wage a resolute struggle against all phenomena that violate the Trade Union Law.
　　　　　　Shandong Province Trade Union Organization is Incomplete, Affecting the Proper Implementation of the Trade Union Law
To the Editor:
　　I am a trade union cadre, and I feel that the Trade Union Law is being poorly implemented in many places. For example, many public and private enterprises fail to allocate trade union funds as stipulated in the Trade Union Law; they do not pay attention to workers' safety and welfare work; especially in many private enterprises, capitalists illegally oppress and exploit workers, restrict workers from joining trade unions, and severely deprive workers of their political freedom. On the one hand, this is because administrative leaders of public enterprises, especially capitalists of private enterprises, lack understanding of the Trade Union Law; but on the other hand, the incomplete trade union organization, the lack of good publicity for the Trade Union Law, and the insufficient adherence to and implementation of the rights and obligations of the trade union stipulated in the Trade Union Law are also important reasons. Last December, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions conducted a registration of its affiliated trade union organizations at all levels. Through this work, we learned about some problems existing in the trade union organization. I think that introducing these problems can attract the attention of comrades working in trade unions in various places and, in turn, improve their own work.
　　The problems we have identified are in the following aspects:
　　(1) The trade union organization is incomplete and fails to exert the role of collective leadership. In most grassroots trade unions, work is not scientifically divided, a few cadres or trade union chairmen who are detached from production are very busy, and the committee members rarely carry out trade union work. In some grassroots trade unions, only the trade union chairman knows the instructions from higher authorities, and he does not convey them to the committee members or discuss matters with everyone. Some grassroots trade union committee members have transferred jobs, and the quota is not complete, leaving only one or two committee members, and re-elections have not been held for a long time. Although many counties have established trade unions, there are only one or two cadres dispatched by the higher authorities, who are aloof and rarely carry out work among the worker masses.
　　(2) Some grassroots trade union organizations are impure. In four grassroots trade unions in Xuzhou and Xin Hailian, nearly a hundred independent producers have joined the trade union. Managers of units such as the Dewei Match Factory in Weihai City and the Jining Private Motor Vehicle Company have also joined the trade union and served as trade union committee members and trade union chairmen. In individual grassroots trade unions in Jinan City, there are even agents of capitalists who have infiltrated the trade union, served as trade union directors, and oppressed and beaten workers on behalf of the capitalists in the name of the trade union, which has greatly damaged the credibility of the trade union among the masses. There are also a few bad elements who have become grassroots trade union cadres, beat and scold workers, and embezzle union dues. For example, Niu Geng, vice chairman of the handicraft dyeing industry in Jinan City, embezzled union dues and abducted women. These facts show that many workers are not sufficiently aware of the nature of the trade union, and they dare not criticize and oppose the shortcomings of the trade union work and various undemocratic phenomena, which has led to the leadership of the trade union being controlled by unscrupulous elements, making the trade union detached from the worker masses.
　　(3) The organization is chaotic. Some places are not organized according to industry; other places, regardless of the actual situation, mechanically divide according to industry, making it difficult to carry out work. The Shidao City Trade Union directly leads more than thirty grassroots organizations without establishing industrial trade unions. The city trade union is in a passive situation, and the work is busy and chaotic. It is also difficult for the Muping County Trade Union to carry out work by forming a grassroots committee with nineteen units of different natures. Some organizations are not divided according to production units, such as: Zhang Zhaofan's group of ten people in Jinan Limin Dyeing Factory includes: three people from the color department, one person from the finishing department, one cook, one boiler worker, and two sales clerks. Such a division of groups makes it difficult to effectively promote production.

　　　　　　A Few Capitalists in Xi'an Persecute Workers, Trade Union Demands Government Punishment
To the Editor:
　　Recently in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, private factory capitalists have been continuously using feudal and barbaric means to beat and abuse workers, restrict workers from participating in trade union activities, and arbitrarily dismiss workers, which are illegal behaviors.
　　On January 20th, Shan Qingchun, manager of Tianxingcheng Hemp Rope Factory, lost 10,000 yuan and suspected that it was stolen by apprentices Zhang Yintang and Wang Xingwa. On the same night, Shan Qingchun called the two apprentices upstairs, stripped them naked, tied them up with ropes, and hung them from the beams to beat them severely, illegally forcing confessions, and shouting: "After killing you, I will put your bodies in wooden boxes and throw them into the city moat. Anyway, there are plenty of apprentices." It was not until the neighbors heard the apprentices' screams and came to dissuade them that the apprentices were spared from harm.
　　He Zhenxiang, manager of the private Zhenhua Textile Factory, does not allow workers to register their household, and does not allow workers to participate in trade unions. He deceived workers by saying: "Participating in the trade union requires paying union dues, and for every bundle of yarn earned (48 yards), 15 yards have to be paid." Later, when he argued with worker Lei Nianwa over a wage dispute, He Zhenxiang slapped Lei Nianwa several times. When the city trade union cadres inquired about the matter, He Zhenxiang even scolded the trade union cadres as "bandits," saying that the trade union was not qualified to manage his affairs.
　　Shen Lujia, manager of the Xiguan Private Labor Union Shoe Factory, privately makes up a roster, forcing workers to invest in shares, and if they do not invest in shares, they will not be given work. Dai Xingfeng, manager of the Dongdajie Jianhua Tea House, ordered all shop assistants to shave their heads and wear long gowns and short jackets. Sun Mengquan, an apprentice at the Tianfeng Sauce Garden on Jiefang Road, was severely beaten by the owner's wife for spilling too much water while sweeping the floor. Apprentices who have worked for several months are not paid wages (the collective labor-capital contract of the industry stipulates that apprentices' monthly wage is four units), but they deceive the trade union cadres by saying that each apprentice earns six realistic units per month.
　　The occurrence of the above facts also shows that the trade union work is not thorough, and the government's labor policies have not been well publicized, so that a few capitalists still retain various barbaric behaviors of oppressing workers from the old society.
　　Now, in order to protect the rights and interests of workers and implement the Trade Union Law, the City Federation of Trade Unions has respectively requested the government to punish these illegal capitalists.

　　　　　　The Baoding City Labor Bureau in Hebei Province Favors Capitalists and Suppresses Workers, Failing to Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Benefit
To the Editor:
　　I am a member of the shop employee trade union in Baoding City, Hebei Province. I am very dissatisfied with the erroneous measures taken by some cadres of the Baoding City Labor Bureau in handling labor-capital disputes, which favor the capitalists and suppress the workers. Because if this continues, it will seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of the workers, violate the policy of labor-capital benefit, and prevent the Trade Union Law from being implemented. The following are a few examples of this phenomenon:
　　Zhou Xiuting, manager of the Dachang Electrical Appliance Store in the Jishan Shopping Mall in Baoding City, illegally requested the Labor Bureau to dismiss worker Zhang Yuzhen in October last year. The Labor Bureau did not solicit the opinions of the workers and the grassroots trade union, and unilaterally approved the manager's request. As a result, the arrogance of the capitalists in persecuting workers was fueled. In January of this year, when worker Wang Lanfu of the store asked for leave to go home, he overstayed his leave by a few days due to snow and difficult transportation. Zhou Xiuting again unreasonably dismissed him. Trade union cadre Zhang Zhongshu protested to the capitalist according to the Trade Union Law and reported it to the Labor Bureau. The Labor Bureau did not understand the situation well, but instead acted as a defender for the capitalist by distorting the facts. It believes: "Since both parties have opinions, those who want to resign are willing to resign, and those who want to leave are willing to leave, so the dismissal is reasonable." Worker Wang Lanfu and the trade union disagreed with this statement and argued on the spot, and it has not been resolved until now.
　　The Nanguan Jinsheng Grocery Store dismissed four shop assistants last year. After consultation between the trade union and the capitalist, the capitalist agreed to pay the workers one and a half months' wages as dismissal compensation. Afterwards, the Labor Bureau learned about it and believed that it was wrong not to notify the Labor Bureau, and forced the workers to return the dismissal compensation to the capitalist for reprocessing. The Hexinglong Sauce Garden dismissed a cook. The labor and capital parties negotiated on their own, and the capitalist paid the worker three months' wages as dismissal compensation. When the Labor Bureau learned about it, it believed that three months' wages as dismissal compensation was too much. Although the Hexinglong capitalist repeatedly stated: "This is our voluntary agreement", "Consider it a gift." The Labor Bureau still did not allow it. Finally, it was decided that the worker would return one month's salary.
　　Xu Runmin, manager of the Zhenguang Photo Studio, illegally beat apprentice Wang Jinlong on August 11 last year. After the matter was reported to the Labor Bureau by the trade union, the Labor Bureau convened a labor-capital consultation meeting. At the meeting, when worker Zhou Zeyun was exposing the fact that manager Xu Runmin had always abused workers, Shang Deming, the section chief of the Labor Bureau, impatiently stopped him before he finished speaking, saying: "It is certainly wrong to beat someone, but the beating is not too bad. Let the capitalist admit his mistake to the worker." The trade union proposed to publish Xu Runmin's mistake in the newspaper to educate other illegal capitalists. However, Section Chief Shang Deming listened to the capitalist's request and decided that the Labor Bureau would issue a notice. Later, when the notice was sent to Deputy Mayor Ding Tingxin for approval, it was only after he pointed out that beating someone was illegal that the Municipal Court sentenced Xu Runmin to three months in prison.
　　This series of measures taken by some cadres of the Labor Bureau that violate the policy of labor-capital benefit has aroused dissatisfaction among the shop employees in Baoding City. Everyone says that the Labor Bureau cadres are "leaning to one side" towards the capitalists. I hope that relevant departments can quickly check and correct this.

### 同违犯工会法的现象进行斗争！

　　同违犯工会法的现象进行斗争！
    编者按：目前有很多地方对《中华人民共和国工会法》——这一国家重要大法，执行的很差。某些国营企业的行政领导干部往往错误地认为工会法只是工会单方面的事，和行政无太大关系；因而采取漠不关心态度。有些私营企业的资方则忽视工会法中所规定的工人应有的权利，仍然以封建社会的各种压迫手段虐待工人，这些违背工会法的现象，是不能容许的。各地工会及政府劳动部门都应有计划地检查工会法的执行，正确处理公私及劳资关系以及工人生活中的一切问题；揭露一切违背工会法的错误现象。同时要对干部和群众认真进行工会法的宣传和教育。工会组织及工人群众必须站在正确的立场上，和各种违犯工会法的现象进行坚决的斗争。
            山东省工会组织不健全  影响工会法不能很好执行编辑同志：
    我是一个工会干部，我感到目前很多地方对工会法执行的很差，如有不少公、私营企业不能按工会法的规定拨交工会经费；不注意工人的保安和福利工作；尤其是在许多私营企业中，资本家非法压迫、剥削工人，限制工人参加工会及剥夺工人政治自由的现象很严重。这一方面是因为公营企业的行政领导干部尤其是私营企业的资方对工会法缺乏认识；但另一方面，工会组织不健全，对工会法未进行很好的宣传，对工会法中所规定的工会的权利、义务坚持和执行得不够，也是重要原因之一。去年十二月，山东省总工会对所属各级工会组织曾进行了一次登记。通过这个工作，使我们了解到工会组织中所存在的某些问题。我想，把这些问题介绍出来，可以引起各地工会工作同志的注意，并进而改进自己的工作。
    我们所检查出来的问题有这样几方面：
    （一）工会组织不健全，未能发挥集体领导作用。在大多数基层工会中，工作没有科学分工，少数脱离生产的干部或工会主席很忙，各委员也很少进行工会工作。有的基层工会，上级的指示只是工会主席一人知道，他不向各委员传达，也不和大家商量办事。有的基层工会委员因工作调动，名额不全，只剩一、二个委员，很长时期也不补选。有不少县虽也成立了工会，但只有上级委派去的一两个干部，高高在上，很少在工人群众中进行工作。
    （二）有的基层工会组织不纯。在徐州、新海连四个基层工会中，有近百名独立生产者参加了工会。在威海市德威火柴厂、济宁市民营汽车公司等单位经理也加入了工会，还当了工会委员、工会主席。在济南市的个别基层工会中，并有资方代理人混进工会，当了工会主任，并以工会名义代为资方压迫、打骂工人，使工会的威信在群众中受到很大的损害。还有少数坏分子当了基层工会干部，打骂工人，贪污会费。如济南市手工漂染业副主席牛耕曾贪污会费拐骗妇女。这些事实说明，不少工人群众对工会的性质还不够了解，对工会工作的缺点和各种不民主现象，也不敢提出批评和反对，以致被不良分子把持了工会的领导，使工会脱离了工人群众。
    （三）组织紊乱，有些地方不按产业划分组织；有些地方则又不顾实际情况，机械地按产业划分，致使工作很难进行。石岛市工会直接领导三十余基层组织而不成立产业工会。市工会领导陷于被动，工作忙乱。牟平县工会将十九个不同性质的单位组成一个基层委员会也很难进行工作。有的组织不按生产单位划分，如：济南利民染厂张兆范小组十个人，包括：颜色部三人、整理处一人、伙夫一人，锅炉工一人、营业职员二人等。这样的划分小组，就很难有效地推动生产。

            西安少数资本家迫害工人  工会要求政府给以惩处编辑同志：
    陕西省西安市近来连续发生私营工厂资方，以封建野蛮手段，打骂虐待工人，限制工人参加工会活动和随便解雇工人等违法行为。
    一月二十日，天兴成麻绳厂经理单青春，遗失了一万块钱，怀疑是学徒张印堂、王兴娃偷去。在当天夜里，单青春便把两个学徒叫到楼上，把他们全身衣服脱光，用绳子捆起来，吊在房梁上毒打，非法逼供，扬言：“打死后尸首装进木匣，扔到城壕里去。反正有的是学徒。”直到邻人听见学徒们的嚎叫声，过来劝阻，学徒们才算幸免毒害。
    私营振华纺织厂经理何振祥，不让工人报户口，不让工人参加工会。他欺骗工人说：“参加工会要缴会费，挣上一捆纱（四十八码）要缴十五码。”后来因工资纠纷和工人雷年娃争执起来时，何振祥便打了雷年娃几耳光。市工会干部过问这件事时，何振祥竟骂工会干部是“土匪”，说工会没资格来管他的事。
    西关私营工联制鞋厂经理申禄加，私造名册，强迫工人入股，不入股便不给活做。东大街建华茶庄经理戴行峰，命令店员一律要推光头，穿长袍短褂。解放路天丰酱园学徒孙梦全扫地时因洒水太多，便遭掌柜太太的毒打。学徒上工了好几个月不给工资（该业劳资集体合同规定学徒每月工资四个单位），却欺骗工会干部说学徒每人每月挣六个折实单位。
    上述事实的发生，也说明了工会工作不深入，对政府的劳动政策未很好宣传，使少数资本家还残存着旧社会压迫工人各种野蛮行为。
    现在市总工会为了保护工人的权益，贯彻工会法，已分别要求政府惩办这些不法资本家。

    河北保定市劳动局偏袒资方压制工人  没有正确执行劳资两利政策编辑同志：
    我是河北省保定市店员工会的会员。我对保定市劳动局某些干部在处理劳资纠纷问题上偏袒资方压制工人的错误措施很不满意。因为这样下去将严重地损害工人的正当权益，违背了劳资两利政策，使工会法不能贯彻实施。下面就是这种现象的几个例子：
    保定市济善商场达昌电料行经理周秀亭，去年十月间向劳动局非法地要求解雇工人张玉振。劳动局没有征求工人和基层工会的意见，竟片面地批准了经理的要求。因此就助长了资方迫害工人的凶焰。今年一月，该店工人王兰甫请假回家时，因下雪交通困难，逾了几天假。周秀亭又蛮横地把他解雇。工会干部张忠恕根据工会法向资方提出抗议，一面报告劳动局。劳动局没有很好了解情况，却替资方当了歪曲事实的辩护人。认为：“既然双方有意见，辞的愿辞，走的愿走，解雇是合理的。”工人王兰甫和工会不同意这种说法，当场争论起来，一直拖到现在还没有解决。
    南关锦生杂货铺去年解雇了四个店员。经工会和资方协商后，资方答应发给工人一个半月的工资作为解雇金。事后劳动局知道了，认为这样没有通知劳动局是不对的，强迫工人把解雇金退给资方重新处理。和兴隆酱园解雇了一个炊事工人。劳资双方自行协商，由资方发给工人三个月工资的解雇金。劳动局知道了，又认为三个月工资的解雇金太多。虽然和兴隆资方一再表示：“这是我们双方自愿的”、“算是馈赠的吧”。劳动局仍不许可。最后决定由工人退回一月的工资。
    真光照相馆经理徐润民，去年八月十一日非法毒打徒工王金龙。事情由工会反映给劳动局后，劳动局就召开劳资协商会议。会上，工人周泽云正在揭发徐润民经理一贯虐待工人的事实时，劳动局尚德明科长没待他说完就不耐烦地制止他说：“打人固然不对，不过打的也不怎样，让资方向工人承认错误就行了。”工会提议把徐润民的错误在报上公布，以便教育其他不法资方。但尚德明科长却听从资方的要求，决定由劳动局通报一下就算了。后来通报送给丁廷馨副市长批审时，经他指出打人是犯法的事后，才由市法院判处徐润民三个月徒刑。
    劳动局某些干部这一连串违背劳资两利政策的措施，已引起保定市店员工人的不满。大家都说劳动局干部向资方“一边倒”。希望有关部门能迅速检查纠正。
