　　Volunteer Army Heroes Defending the Han River Front
       Yan Wu
    Since January 25th of this year, the American aggressor troops have launched another reckless offensive on the Han River front, attempting to recapture Seoul and advance further into northern Korea. However, in the face of the brave soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, the enemy's dream has consistently failed to materialize.
    When the enemy approached the Taehwa Mountain and Cheondeok Peak positions, which the Volunteer Army had arranged according to plan, fierce fighting began. The enemy used planes and artillery to bombard the Volunteer Army positions fiercely, and drove large numbers of soldiers to attack repeatedly. However, although the American aggressors' artillery shells and bombs turned the snowy ground into a scorched earth, they could not destroy the Volunteer Army soldiers' determination to kill the enemy. The Volunteer Army soldiers said, "If the enemy turns our positions from white to black, we will turn the enemy's positions from white to red!"
    The Volunteer Army soldiers defeated the crazy enemy with their bravery, ingenuity, and clever tactics. In the southwest of Guanyinli, there was a small high ground, guarded by more than eighty Volunteer Army soldiers. The invading army dispatched fifty-two tanks and twenty-four aircraft to cover infantry in fierce attacks on this high ground, one after another. The enemy who rushed up initially numbered dozens, then increased to hundreds, and finally surged up in thousands. MacArthur妄想妄想 used the bodies of his soldiers to pave his road to "victory." The battle continued until dusk, and this high ground was always in the hands of the Volunteer Army. The invading army retreated with batches of wounded soldiers in trucks, leaving more than three hundred corpses on the position. In one battle, two Volunteer Army soldiers, Liu Kunyi and Zhang Wensheng, guarded a small hill. The invading army launched three "massive" attacks with a battalion of troops under the cover of artillery and aircraft, but all three were repelled down the mountain, suffering heavy casualties.
    In another battle, Wei Jingbin, the deputy squad leader of a certain Volunteer Army unit, and his two comrades cleverly hid in one place. The invading army fired more than six hundred shells at the position held by these three warriors, and then the infantry began to charge. These three warriors calmly fired, knocking down eighteen enemies in a row, but the enemy never understood where the bullets were coming from.
    Once, the invading army occupied the Yingzipeng position that the Volunteer Army had abandoned according to plan. Just as they were busy pitching tents and opening cans, twenty-six Volunteer Army soldiers suddenly appeared, and five hundred beasts hurriedly abandoned their machine guns and rocket launchers and fled.
    Every night, Volunteer Army soldiers would insert themselves into the enemy's heart to conduct activities. This made the invading army unable to sleep peacefully, and they fired guns and artillery all night long. Han Jisheng, the reconnaissance squad leader of a certain unit, and his comrades sneaked into the enemy camp at night, penetrating all the way to the enemy's rear eighty miles south of Icheon. They sneaked into a temple; the enemy was drinking and playing cards inside. The warriors threw grenades in from the door, scattering the beasts everywhere. They took the opportunity to grab a prisoner and brought him back. There are countless such stories of elusive and unpredictable actions on the front line. There is Dong Aimin, who sneaked past the enemy's layers of sentries and captured six American soldiers in one night; there is Chen Xihuan, who set fire to enemy vehicles; and there are also the twenty-three warriors who killed forty-one enemies and captured three enemies in one night. They used all kinds of methods day and night to strike at the invading enemy.
    On the front line, touching and inspiring stories emerge endlessly. The Volunteer Army soldiers witnessed with their own eyes the countless Korean houses being burned and countless Korean people being slaughtered under the claws of the American aggressors, and the children who lost their parents crying in the cold wind. Their hearts were filled with hatred for the American aggressors, and therefore they showed extraordinary bravery and determination in battle. In one battle, soldier Yao Dafu's leg was broken, and the instructor wanted to carry him away from the battlefield; he resolutely refused, saying, "Give me a grenade, I will not disgrace the motherland! I will fight the enemy to my last breath and avenge the Korean people!" When the enemy rushed up, he pulled the pin on the grenade and heroically perished together with the enemy. Many soldiers' ears were deafened by the bombing, but their eyes were still wide open, monitoring the enemy. Many soldiers were buried several times by the dust raised by enemy artillery fire, but after they crawled out, they continued to fight. Although the old hero He Deyuan, who was over forty years old, sacrificed himself, his body still stood upright, and the enemy did not dare to approach him. The immortal images of these heroes will forever live in the hearts of the Korean and Chinese people.
    In the fierce battle, the pine trees on many Korean mountains were scorched, and the accumulated snow was dried, but the warriors' will to avenge was boiling like the torrent in the thawing Han River. It is with this will that the American aggressors will be completely driven out of the land of Korea. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 守卫在汉江前线的志愿军英雄们

　　守卫在汉江前线的志愿军英雄们
       阎吾
    从今年一月二十五日起，美国侵略军又在汉江前线发动了冒险进攻，妄图重占汉城，再向朝鲜北部进犯。但是在朝、中人民部队的勇士们面前，敌人的这一梦想始终未能实现。
    当敌人进到志愿军按预定计划布置好的泰华山和天德峰阵地前时，激烈的战斗就开始了。敌人用飞机大炮猛烈地向志愿军阵地轰击，并驱使大批士兵反复进攻。可是美国侵略者的大炮炸弹虽然把雪地轰成了一片焦土，却无法摧毁志愿军勇士们的杀敌决心。志愿军勇士们说：“敌人把我们的阵地由白的变成黑的，我们就要把敌人的阵地由白的变成红的！”
    志愿军战士们以自己的英勇机智与巧妙的战术战胜了疯狂的敌人。在观音里西南有一块小小的高地，守卫这个高地的是八十多个志愿军战士。侵略军出动了五十二辆坦克和二十四架飞机，掩护步兵一次接一次地向这个高地猛攻。冲上来的敌人最初是几十个人，后来增加到几百个人，最后是成千地扑上来。麦克阿瑟妄想用他的士兵的尸体来铺平他的“胜利”道路。战斗一直进行到黄昏，这个高地始终在志愿军手里。侵略军用汽车拉着成批的伤兵退回去了，还在阵地上遗下了三百多具尸体。在某一次战斗中，志愿军的两个勇士刘坤一和张文胜扼守着一个小山头。侵略军以一个营的兵力，在大炮、飞机掩护下发动了三次“声势浩大”的攻击，可是三次都被打下山去，并且蒙受了重大的伤亡。
    在另一次战斗中，志愿军某部副班长魏景斌和他的两个战友巧妙地隐蔽在一个地方。侵略军向这三位勇士所扼守的阵地上足足打了六百多发炮弹，然后步兵开始冲锋。这三位勇士沉着地射击，一连打倒十八个敌人，可是敌人却始终不明白子弹是从那里打来的。
    有一次，侵略军占领了志愿军有计划放弃的莺子峰阵地。正当他们在那里忙着撑帐篷，开罐头的时候，二十六名志愿军勇士突然出现了，五百名兽兵慌忙丢掉了机枪、火箭炮逃走了。
    每到夜间，志愿军战士们就插到敌人心窝里去活动。搞得侵略军不能安眠，整夜乱打枪炮。某部侦察班长韩际生和他的战友们夜摸敌营，一直插入到八十多里外利川南面的敌人后方。他们摸进一座庙去；敌人正在里面喝酒玩牌。勇士们从门口，将手榴弹扔进去，打得兽兵们四处乱窜。他们趁机抓了一个俘虏，带了回来。在前线上有着无数这样的神出鬼没的故事。这里有摸过敌人层层岗哨，一夜连捉六个美国兵的董爱民；有火烧敌人汽车的陈希焕；还有一夜打死四十一个敌人，俘敌三名的二十三勇士。他们日日夜夜用各种各样的办法来打击进犯的敌人。
    在前线上，可歌可泣的故事是层出不穷的。志愿军的战士们亲眼看到在美国侵略者的魔爪之下，无数朝鲜的房屋在焚烧，无数朝鲜的人民被屠杀，失去父母的孩子在寒风中哭叫。他们心里充满了对美国侵略者的仇恨，因而在战斗中显出了非凡的勇敢与坚定。战士姚大福在一次战斗中腿被打断，指导员要背他离开战场；他坚决拒绝说：“给我个手榴弹，我不会给祖国丢脸的！我还要和敌人拼最后一口气，为朝鲜人民报仇！”当敌人冲上来时，他拉响了手榴弹，壮烈地和敌人同归于尽。许多战士的耳朵被轰炸声震聋了，可是他们的眼睛还是圆睁着监视着敌人。许多战士被敌人炮火轰起的尘土埋住过几次，但是他们爬出来以后继续战斗。四十多岁的老英雄赫德元虽然牺牲了，但他的躯体依然屹立着，敌人竟不敢接近他。这些英雄们的不朽形象，将永远活在朝、中人民的心里。
    在激烈的战斗里，朝鲜许多山岭上的苍松烧焦了，积雪烧干了，可是勇士们的复仇意志，却正像解了冻的汉江里的滚滚激流那样沸腾着，正是这样意志，将要把美国侵略者完全从朝鲜的土地上赶出去。  （新华社）
