[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held an expanded meeting on the 15th to discuss methods for implementing the Central People's Government's "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" and the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference's "Resolution on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries." The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau also displayed evidence of some counter-revolutionary cases at the venue for the attendees' reference.

The meeting began at 2:00 PM. In addition to the members of the Consultative Committee, attendees included members of the Municipal People's Government, heads of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, chairmen of the People's Representative Conference Consultative Committees of various districts, and representatives from various democratic parties, factories, schools, and religious circles, totaling 134 people. The perimeter of the venue was filled with pictures of evidence of counter-revolutionary activities, and more than 100 volumes of case files and confessions were arranged for viewing. In glass cabinets, various criminal objects of counter-revolutionary activities were displayed: mortars, rifles, pistols, silent pistols, pen guns, riding crop guns, assassination bullets, radios, seals, orders, codes, and various intelligence reports, including intelligence cards on our government leaders and leaders of various democratic parties, which recorded their positions, addresses, telephone numbers, and some car license plate numbers. Among the various pieces of criminal evidence, what was particularly shocking was the mortar and survey map prepared by American-Chiang Kai-shek spies to bombard Tiananmen Square during last year's National Day; the arrow on the map pointed directly at the reviewing stand on Tiananmen Square. However, this major conspiracy was uncovered by the Public Security Bureau a few days before its implementation. Upon seeing this shocking evidence of conspiracy, the attendees gnashed their teeth at the American-Chiang Kai-shek agents, filled with extreme hatred.

  Peng Zhen Explained the Significance of the Meeting, Requesting a Principled Discussion on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Peng Zhen first explained the significance of holding the expanded meeting. He pointed out: "In the past two years, Beijing's public security work has made great achievements. It has destroyed the remaining counter-revolutionary organizations and suppressed the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. However, Beijing is the people's capital, and the enemy has used great force to carry out sabotage. Although fewer major incidents have occurred in the past, many counter-revolutionary sabotage activities have taken place, proving that Beijing's work in suppressing counter-revolutionaries is still insufficient. Beijing also has a tendency toward 'boundless leniency.' Now the Municipal Public Security Bureau has sorted out some cases based on the 'Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China.' Today, we are reporting to the Consultative Committee and bringing some case files and physical evidence of important cases. The comrades who are pre-trialing these cases have also come. Everyone can refer to them and ask questions. After our principled discussion, the Public Security Bureau can handle the cases concretely based on the common opinions."

  Feng Jiping's Report Pointed Out Five Types of Counter-Revolutionary Cases

Subsequently, Deputy Director Feng Jiping gave a general report on counter-revolutionary cases, dividing the sorted-out counter-revolutionary cases into five types, giving several detailed examples for each type. The first type is the chief culprits who have consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. He cited the crimes of Kuomintang secret agents Li Suhou, Zhu Shilin, and Jiang Hongtao, and Central Bureau of Statistics secret agents Leng Shaoying and Li Zhizhong as examples. Among them, Li Suhou used machine guns to shoot and kill more than 1,000 people in Yishui, Shandong; Zhu Shilin arrested more than 200 revolutionary workers and progressive masses in Baoding and personally strangled 15 people to death; Leng Shaoying was the culprit who beat Professor Chen Jinkun and other patriotic people and severely tortured more than 60 patriotic students in Zhongshan Park in Beijing in 1946; and Li Zhizhong was the chief culprit who massacred the masses and stole intelligence in the Inner Mongolia Liberated Area. The second type is those who continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities without repentance after liberation, such as Kuomintang secret agent Wang Fengchao, who was one of the bandits led by the bandit leader Diao Huaren, a famous gunslinger, specializing in murder, who served as a traitor, burned down more than 1,000 civilian houses in Hejian, and hid in Haidian Town in the western suburbs of Beijing after liberation, colluding to rob and injure victims; Kuomintang secret agent Chen Gongfu, who organized the "North China Guerrilla Column Headquarters" after liberation, preparing to establish a guerrilla base in the Taihang Mountains, recruiting bandits and scattered soldiers from Daqingshan to carry out riots; Kuomintang secret agent Wang Yuheng, who was the mastermind behind the arson planned at Roosevelt Road and the East Railway Station in Tianjin during last year's National Day; and Kuomintang Major General secret agent Feng Lanting, who set up lurking radio stations in Shenyang, Siping, and Beijing, and organized the so-called "Martyred Comrades Association" during his arrest and detention, appointing a "Guerrilla Army" commander, attempting to seize weapons and go to the Taihang Mountains to fight "guerrilla warfare." The third type is secret agent leaders who use feudal secret societies to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Such as the "Yu Jiutian" "Lord of Heaven" Li Taisheng of the Jiugong Tao, who gathered more than 5,000 followers, conspiring to riot on the second day of the second lunar month and the third day of the third lunar month last year; the altar master of the Jiugong Tao, Jin Hankui, who specialized in creating rumors against the government and insulting the government, with seven large volumes and more than 90 kinds of reactionary rumors he personally created and wrote being seized. The fourth type is local tyrants. Such as "Nan Batian," one of the five tyrants of Tianqiao in Beijing, nicknamed "Living閻王," who occupied restaurants and teahouses, forcing people to death. The masses in the Tianqiao area hated him to the bone and filed lawsuits; Guan Huating, one of the three major tyrants outside Guangqumen, who seized land, raped women, grabbed laborers for the Japanese invaders, and killed peasants and anti-Japanese cadres. The fifth type is habitual bandits, such as Zhao Xiushan, who committed 17 robberies in eight months, Xu Tongsen, who scalded the victim with hot chopsticks, Cai Jingyuan, who was released after being arrested and granted leniency but then colluded to rob tombs 32 times, Wang De, who resisted arrest with a gun and injured people's police, and Zhang Zhenhuan and Chen Pi, who organized prison break riots. Deputy Director Feng said: "These counter-revolutionary elements have been carefully investigated and interrogated, with witnesses and physical evidence, and accusations and reports from the people. Among them, there are those who are extremely guilty and have killed many people, those who are unrepentant and continue to do evil even after being granted leniency, or those who refuse labor reform. Many victims of the people demand that the government redress their grievances and take revenge, and severely punish them. However, because we had a bias toward 'unilateral leniency' and 'boundless leniency' in the past, we were lenient to those who should not have been lenient, and those with serious crimes were given light sentences, and those who should have been executed were sentenced to three or five years in prison. This not only dissatisfied the masses, but also fueled the arrogance of the counter-revolutionary elements, making them dare to be unscrupulous and repeatedly do evil, being sent here after being caught, doing evil after being released, and destroying things even when locked up. Some have been arrested six times in a row but still refuse to repent, and those who are imprisoned are unwilling to repent. They said: 'The Communist Party is nothing great. Criticism is farting, confession is singing, reflection is resting, and labor reform is physical exercise.' Some counter-revolutionary elements have sneaked into our agencies, factories, and schools to carry out sabotage and steal documents. If we don't severely suppress them, these counter-revolutionary elements will become even more lawless." Deputy Director Feng pointed out: Not long ago, Beijing executed 58 counter-revolutionary elements, and the citizens universally and enthusiastically supported it. They said: "It should have been done a long time ago. The People's Government has woken up. More should be killed." Deputy Director Feng said: "Since the execution of that group of counter-revolutionary elements, the people's enthusiasm for anti-espionage and anti-treachery has significantly increased, and the number of people reporting and exposing secret agents to the government is increasing day by day. At the same time, it has also played a suppressive role on counter-revolutionary elements. Twenty-seven counter-revolutionary elements at the Changxindian Railway Factory registered within four days and handed over the guns they had been hiding for more than two years. In just the last few days, reactionary elements have handed over 30 guns. Reactionary elements who were previously disobedient to control also ran to the police station to declare: "I will never engage in counter-revolutionary activities again. If I do, you can kill me." Deputy Director Feng finally pointed out: "Only by correctly combining suppression and leniency can we suppress the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements and prompt those who are willing to repent to come to their senses."

After Deputy Director Feng's report, there was a break of about one hour. The attendees then visited the exhibited evidence materials. When the meeting continued, more than 30 people requested to speak. After listening to the report and seeing the criminal evidence and murder weapons of the counter-revolutionary elements, they were filled with righteous indignation. During their speeches, they unanimously and firmly demanded that the government severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements.

  Attendees Spoke Out, Severely Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities Is Completely in Line with the Demands of the People

Zheng Yun, who has been engaged in elementary school education for more than 30 years and was newly elected as a member of the Municipal People's Government, advocated that those with definite crimes and definite evidence should be severely punished, with murderers being put to death, and that leniency should no longer be exercised. She said: In the past two years, the people's lives and property have suffered considerable losses, and thousands of peaceful and law-abiding working people have been killed by counter-revolutionary elements. If they are shown further leniency, the masses will not be satisfied. For more than two years, they have been subjected to education and labor reform, which can be considered leniency, but they still do evil without changing, so they can no longer be treated with such leniency. Chen Mingde, General Manager of Xinmin Daily and member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, also advocated that counter-revolutionary elements should not be treated too leniently. He said: "If we let them go, we would be violating the interests of the people. What we fear is not killing those who should be killed and not detaining those who should be detained. Only by killing them can we warn hundreds and thousands. The more thorough, clean, and severe the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionary elements, the more it meets the demands of the people." Zhao Fusan, Associate General Secretary of the YMCA, reported that secret agents had infiltrated the YMCA to set fires and carry out sabotage activities. Counter-revolutionary elements should be resolutely suppressed, and he advocated that the church should strengthen its vigilance. Yang Yisan, a representative of the Hui people, recalled the process of the masses in Baizhifang accusing the tyrant "Nan Batian," reflecting the masses' extreme hatred for the tyrant. Ning Wu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Convener of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, expressed his admiration for the Public Security Department's work in cracking down on the American-Chiang Kai-shek spy network. Standing from the position of the democratic parties, he fully supported the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He said: "Counter-revolutionary elements are always looking for opportunities to infiltrate the ranks of the People's Government and take the opportunity to carry out sabotage. Our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang discovered the counter-revolutionary element Yang Shoude, and we have already conducted a review." He suggested that the people establish a suppression network to assist the government in exposing counter-revolutionary elements.

  Counter-Revolutionary Elements Harm Industry and Commerce; The Industrial and Commercial Circles Are Willing to Assist the Government in Suppression

Fu Huating, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, Le Songsheng, Manager of Beijing Tongrentang Lejia Old Shop and newly elected member of the Municipal People's Government, and Sun Fuling, Manager of Fuxing Flour Mill and Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Consultative Committee, unanimously supported the government's Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries. Fu Huating believed that the promulgation of this regulation was very timely and expressed that the industrial and commercial circles were willing to do their best to assist the government in this work. Le Songsheng expressed his gratitude to the comrades of the Public Security Department for cracking down on these counter-revolutionary activities and reducing the losses of the people. He hoped that the government would punish counter-revolutionary elements according to the regulations and not be lenient. Sun Fuling recalled the situation before liberation and said: The industrial and commercial circles were the targets of bullying by counter-revolutionary elements and suffered great damage. Today, the government is punishing counter-revolutionaries, and our industrial and commercial circles fully support it. He cited the example of counter-revolutionary elements infiltrating the Federation of Industry and Commerce to illustrate that with counter-revolutionary elements, all the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce was disrupted by him. Now that he has been arrested, the work is proceeding smoothly, proving that suppressing counter-revolutionary elements is of great benefit to the industrial and commercial circles. He advocated that all counter-revolutionary elements with murder cases should be killed. We should not consider the number of people killed, but only whether they should be killed or not. Those who should be killed should be killed; those who should be detained should be detained.

  Religious Circles Are Determined to Raise Vigilance and Will Not Allow Counter-Revolutionary Elements to Be Active

Zhu Fuxiang, a Catholic and Principal of Guanghua Girls' High School, expressed his firm support for the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He said that this was a wise policy that was urgently demanded and enthusiastically welcomed by the vast majority of the people. He believed that without thoroughly eliminating those secret agent elements who were plotting sabotage, our foundation for construction would not be solid. He said that as far as he personally knew, people in the Catholic Church unanimously believed that the government's promulgation of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries was correct. Although the church itself is pure, there are a few backward elements who are being used by imperialism to carry out anti-people activities. This is not only a violation of religious rules, but also a violation of national law. We firmly support the government's severe punishment of these degenerates. He called on Catholic friends to actively promote the Catholic Reform Movement, sever all relations with imperialism, and prevent counter-revolutionary elements from using religion to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Master Juzan, a Buddhist who abstains from killing, advocated opening the killing spree. He said: Killing counter-revolutionary elements does not contradict the Buddhist precepts against killing. Because killing a few reactionary elements saves the majority of the people and reduces the number of people committing crimes, this is meritorious.

  Counter-Revolutionary Elements Are Guilty of Heinous Crimes; Chief Culprits Must Be Killed

Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Beijing University Affairs Committee, raised the issue of school safety. Beijing University discovered that counter-revolutionary elements were plotting arson in the May Fourth Library. Fortunately, it was discovered early, otherwise, the entire Faculty of Science would have been burned down; there was also an incident of writing reactionary slogans in the work memorial room of Chairman Mao and Mr. Li Dazhao. These facts prove that many counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated the school.

Lei Jieqiong, member of the Municipal People's Government and Director of the Beijing Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, expressed her complete agreement with Mr. Tang Yongtong's opinion and advocated that those arrested counter-revolutionary elements who should be killed must be killed. Chai Degeng, Chairman of the Trade Union of Fu Jen Catholic University, just returned from visiting the land reform in the Central and Southern China. He said that what he saw was that in the rural areas that had not undergone land reform, the reactionary forces were very strong. After the land reform, the masses have risen up, and counter-revolutionary elements cannot hide. But on the other hand, the government must also support the masses. In Beijing, there are still few masses who have risen up to expose counter-revolutionary elements. This is mainly due to the government's leniency. If the government severely suppresses counter-revolutionary elements, the masses will rise up to expose them. Zhao Zichen, Dean of the School of Theology of Yenching University, advocated that the government should severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements, and the people should also be responsible for exposing them. He asked Christian groups to be vigilant and not allow counter-revolutionary elements to have loopholes to exploit. Liu Tongen, a peasant representative and member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, said: In the past, the government was too lenient to counter-revolutionary elements, and the common people did not dare to accuse them. Recently, our 16th District arrested more than 40 counter-revolutionary elements. Our peasants raised their opinions at the district People's Representative Conference, hoping that the government would be practical and execute those counter-revolutionary elements who harmed the people as soon as possible. Last year, our district killed eleven reactionary elements, but after inspection, it was still not enough. For example, the reactionary element An Wenbo, who killed two people, has not been executed and has only been sentenced to six years in prison. Everyone thinks it is too lenient and asks the government to severely punish him. Xu Beihong, Dean of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, said with great enthusiasm and anger that these counter-revolutionary elements were guilty of heinous crimes and "one death is not enough to atone for their sins." In particular, the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent conspiracy case would have been terrible if it had not been cracked down on early. The People's Government should not only arrest them, but also execute them with severe sentences. Zhao Zhantan, Chairman of the Trade Union of Qinghe Woolen Mill, accused the traitor Wang Shoulung who had done evil in the factory. He said: "When the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, Wang Shoulung acted as a lackey of the Japanese and killed four people. No one in the 280-plus workers in the combing and spinning department has not been beaten by him. He raped female workers, and those who refused were ordered to be bitten by dogs. At last year's accusation meeting, six female workers accused him on the spot. After liberation, the factory director still retained him, and the workers were not satisfied. After the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement began, the workers complained about him alone. Based on everyone's opinion, the government arrested him, and production immediately improved. On the day he was publicly tried, each spinning wheel spun 30 pounds more yarn. When I came to this meeting, my colleagues said to me: "You go and ask the government to send Wang Shoulung to our factory to be shot."

Peng Jixian, a student representative from Normal University, and Fan Jingwen, a student representative from Private Xinsheng Middle School, both stood up to represent their classmates and expressed their firm support for the People's Government's Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries. Peng Jixian said: On April 9, 1948, a large number of secret agents broke into our Normal University and dragged eight students away from their dreams. They were beaten all over with bruises, blood flowed all over the bed, and dyed the road at the school gate red. We will never forget this bloody memory. He asked the government to kill as many secret agents as should be killed. Fan Jingwen also asked the government to severely punish secret agents, especially those who suppressed the patriotic student movement. He said: Our school used to be Zhicheng Middle School, a famous reactionary school. I was also deceived by secret agents and tricked into joining the Three Youth League. Later, I heard that the Three Youth League was a secret agent organization, and I really wanted to cry. Now I ask the government to severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements. Tao Dayong, a member of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, was very moved after listening to the speeches of many representatives. The representatives unanimously demanded the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he said, which represents the demands of the people of Beijing. He put forward three hopes: First, the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements should be combined with the patriotic movement. Second, the Public Security Department should compile and print the crimes of many counter-revolutionary elements seen today into a book so that the broad masses of citizens can also see them. Third, counter-revolutionary elements with solid evidence should be executed immediately.

  Factory Production Must Not Be Sabotaged; The Government Should Severely Punish Counter-Revolutionaries

Li Guorui, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Waterworks Company and member of the Municipal People's Government, and Li Yonglu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Partition Committee of the Railway Trade Union and member of the Municipal People's Government, listed various sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements in factories and railways in Beijing. They said: Workers are actively producing and increasing wealth for the country, but the enemy is actively sabotaging production. The government can no longer hesitate about these people. Li Guorui also suggested that the government must severely deal with counter-revolutionary elements who have solid evidence of murder and arson. The impromptu speeches continued until 9:00 PM. Finally, Zhang Xiruo, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, was invited to speak. He further explained the root cause of counter-revolutionary crimes, raising everyone's awareness ideologically. He said: Counter-revolutionary activities are not accidental, but inevitable. Because the scale of our revolution is too large. A small number of people who used to exploit and oppress the people will definitely oppose our revolution. It is not in accordance with objective facts to hope that they will not come again. Only by finding ways to severely attack them can we do it. Chairman Mao told us in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that we can only exercise dictatorship over these people, that is the reason. At the same time, today's Chinese counter-revolutionary elements are formally sent from Taiwan, but in fact they are sent by American imperialism. This is another serious international struggle. Therefore, we must suppress them more thoroughly. I suggest that the various pieces of evidence in the international espionage case exhibited here today be compiled and translated into foreign languages as propaganda materials for the international struggle against American imperialism.

  Chairman Peng Zhen and Concurrently Director Luo Ruiqing Spoke, Agreeing to Handle the Cases According to the Spirit of the Discussion

Luo Ruiqing, the Municipal Public Security Bureau Director concurrently, accepted everyone's opinions on the spot on behalf of the public security organs. He said: We must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements. Only by resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities can the Resist America and Aid Korea and construction work proceed smoothly. Of course, resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities does not mean not being lenient. The principle of combining suppression and leniency is absolutely unshakable, and neither can be dispensed with. But leniency must have boundaries, and only those who should be lenient should be lenient. Boundless leniency is equal to encouraging counter-revolution, and bandits and secret agents will never be eliminated, and not killing one today may force us to kill three tomorrow. Without resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, even the secret agents who can be won over for reform are difficult to reform. In his speech, Luo Ruiqing explained some specific issues raised by everyone. He pointed out: Some people have asked that the sentences should be heavier, and this kind of hatred for the enemy is good. But when the public security organs handle cases, they should still be realistic and seek truth from facts, and should be neither light nor heavy, appropriate and suitable.

Chairman Peng Zhen listened attentively to the speeches at the meeting from beginning to end. Finally, he stood up and said: Today's meeting was very good. The speeches of the members of the Consultative Committee, the representatives of all circles, and the responsible comrades of various government departments are the same as the opinions of the people of all strata that we have heard, and they do represent the opinions of the people of all circles. I completely agree with Director Luo's speech on suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Resolutely suppressing all counter-revolutionary activities is beneficial to the people. The basis for handling counter-revolutionary cases is one is evidence and the other is the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." We should strictly abide by these two bases. The sentencing should be neither light nor heavy, and no one should be wrongly killed. Even if there are a thousand who should be killed, a thousand is not too many; if there is not one who should be killed, even killing one is too many, killing wrongly, and this should never be done. After today's full discussion, everyone has listened to the report and reviewed the case files and evidence, and they all advocate resolutely suppressing these counter-revolutionary elements. The competent departments should seriously and prudently handle these cases in accordance with this spirit.

　　北京市人民代表会议协商委员会扩大会议
    要求政府严惩反革命罪犯
    大家一致拥护执行惩治反革命条例
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会十五日举行扩大会议，讨论执行中央人民政府“惩治反革命条例”和北京市各界人民代表会议“关于镇压反革命的决议”办法。京市人民政府公安局并将一部分反革命案件的罪证在会场陈列，供到会人士参考。
    会议在下午二时开始。出席的除协商委员会委员之外，还有市人民政府委员、市政府各局、处负责人，各区人民代表会议协商委员会主席，各民主党派、工厂、学校和宗教界的代表等共一百三十四人。会场的周围布满了反革命活动的罪证图片，排列着一百多册案卷供词。在玻璃柜中陈列反革命活动的各种犯罪实物：有迫击炮、长枪、短枪、无声手枪、钢笔手枪、马鞭手枪、暗杀弹、电台、关防、派令、密码和各种情报，其中并有关于我政府首长与各民主党派领袖的情报卡片，上面记录着他们的职位、住址、电话号码，并有一部分汽车号码。在各种犯罪证件中，特别使人惊心动魄的，是美蒋间谍准备在去年国庆节轰击天安门的迫击炮和测绘图，图上的箭头直指天安门的检阅台。但是这个重大阴谋案在实施的前几天被公安局破获了。到会的观众看到这个惊人触目的阴谋罪证，对美蒋特务无不咬牙切齿，极端愤恨。
  彭真主席说明开会意义  要求对镇压反革命作原则讨论
    开会时，首先由彭真主席说明举行扩大会议的意义。他指出：“两年来北京的公安工作，是有很大成绩的。它摧毁了反革命残余的组织，镇压了反革命分子的活动。但是北京是人民的首都，敌人用了极大的力量来进行破坏。过去虽然大乱子出得较少，但也发生过不少的反革命破坏活动，证明北京市镇压反革命的工作还做得不够。北京市同样也有‘宽大无边’的偏向，现在市公安局根据‘中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例’，清理出了一部分案件。今天向协商委员会报告，并带来了一部分案卷、重要案件的罪证实物。预审这些案件的同志也来了。大家可以参考，询问。我们作原则讨论后公安局即可根据共同的意见，具体处理案件。”
  冯基平报告指出反革命案件五个类型
    继由冯基平副局长概括地报告反革命案件，他把已清理的反革命案件分作五个类型，每一类型都举出了几个详细的例证。第一类是一贯进行反革命活动的首恶分子。他举出军统特务李肃侯、朱士林、江洪涛，中统特务冷少颖、李执中等的罪行作例子。其中，李肃侯在山东沂水用机枪射杀过群众一千多人；朱士林曾在保定逮捕两百多个革命工作人员和进步群众，亲自勒死十五人；冷少颖是一九四六年在北京中山公园殴打陈瑾昆教授和其他爱国人士，严刑拷打爱国学生六十多人的凶手；李执中是在内蒙解放区屠杀群众、窃取情报的首恶。第二类是解放以后仍怙恶不悛地继续进行反革命活动的分子，其中如军统特务王凤巢，是匪首刁化仁所领导的暴徒之一，有名的黑枪手，专作杀人勾当，当过汉奸，曾在河间烧毁民房一千多间，在解放后潜伏北京西郊海淀镇，结伙抢劫，伤害事主；军统特务陈公黻，在解放后组织“华北游击纵队司令部”，准备在太行山建立游击根据地，收罗大青山的土匪散兵，进行暴乱；军统特务王玉恒，是去年国庆节准备在天津罗斯福路和东车站放火的主谋人；军统少将特务冯兰亭，在沈阳、四平、北京布置潜伏电台，在逮捕关押期间，又组织所谓“蒙难同志会”，委派“游击军”司令，企图夺取武器到太行山打“游击”。第三类是利用封建会道门进行反革命活动的特务道首。如九宫道“余九天”“天主”李泰成，纠合道徒五千余人，阴谋在去年旧历二月二日、三月三日暴动；九宫道坛主金汉魁，专门制造反对政府侮辱政府的谣言，他亲手制造写成的反动谣言被搜出的就有七大本，九十多种。第四类是恶霸。如北京天桥五霸之一的“南霸天”，外号“活阎王”，霸占饭铺、茶馆，逼死人命，天桥一带的群众，恨之入骨，群起控诉；广渠门外三大恶霸之一的关华亭，强占土地，强奸妇女，替日寇抓劳工，杀害农民和抗日干部。第五类是惯匪，如八个月行抢十七次的赵秀山，用火筷烫伤事主的徐桐森，被捕后被宽大释放又结伙盗墓三十二次的蔡景元，开枪拒捕、伤害人民警察的王德，组织越狱暴动的张振寰、陈皮等。冯副局长说：“这些反革命分子，都经过仔细的侦察与审讯，有人证物证，人民控诉检举。其中有罪大恶极、杀人很多的，有怙恶不悛，经过宽大仍继续作恶，或者拒绝劳动改造的。很多受害的人民，要求政府伸冤报仇，严办他们。但因为我们过去有‘片面宽大’‘宽大无边’的偏向，把不应宽大的宽大了，有重罪的判轻了，应当处死的判了三年或五年徒刑。这不仅使群众不满，而且助长了反革命分子的气焰，使他们敢于肆无忌惮，反复作恶，破获了又派来，释放了又作恶，关起来还破坏。有的一连抓过六次仍不改悔，关着的也不肯悔过自新。他们说：‘共产党没有什么了不起。批评是放屁，坦白是唱戏，反省是休息，劳动改造是锻炼身体。’还有一些反革命分子，钻进我们的机关、工厂、学校，进行破坏，偷窃文件。如果再不严厉镇压，这些反革命分子会更加无法无天”。冯副局长指出：不久以前，北京处死了五十八名反革命分子，市民普遍地热烈拥护。他们说：“早就应当这样办。人民政府睡醒了。还应该再杀一些。”冯副局长说：“自从枪毙了那一批反革命分子，人民反特防奸的积极性显著提高，向政府密告与检举特务的，一天天增加。同时对反革命分子也起了镇压作用。长辛店铁路工厂四天内就有二十七个反革命分子报名登记，把隐藏两年多的枪枝也交出来了。只最近几天来说，反动分子交出来的枪枝，就有三十条。过去不服管制的反动分子，也跑到派出所声明：“以后决不再作反革命活动。再活动，你们就杀我的头。”冯副局长最后指出：“必须把镇压和宽大正确地结合起来才能把反革命分子的气焰压下去，促使那些愿意悔过的悔悟过来。”
    冯副局长报告之后，休会约一小时。出席会议的人即参观陈列着的罪证材料。继续开会时，要求发言的有三十多人。他们听了报告，看了反革命分子犯罪证物和杀人武器，义愤填胸。发言时，异口同声地坚决要求政府严厉镇压反革命分子。
  与会者发言  严厉镇压反革命活动  完全合乎人民的要求
    办了三十多年小学教育、新当选为市人民政府委员的郑芸主张：凡是有确实罪状，有确实证据的，就应该严厉惩治，杀人者死，不能再行宽大。她说：两年以来，人民的生命财产已经损失不小，成千成百的和平安分的劳动人民遭受反革命分子杀害，如果对他们再宽大，群众是不会满意的。两年多来，对他们进行了教育与劳动改造，可以说宽大，但是他们还是为恶不改，就不能再这样宽大了。新民报总经理、市协商委员会委员陈铭德，也主张对反革命分子，不能太宽大了。他说：“如果放松了他们，就是违反人民的利益。我们怕的是该杀的不杀，该关的不关。只有杀了，才能儆百儆千。人民政府镇压反革命分子，越彻底、越干净、越严厉，就越合乎人民的要求。”基督教青年会副总干事赵复三报告，青年会曾有特务钻进去放火，进行破坏活动。对反革命分子应坚决镇压，并主张教会应该加强警惕。回民代表杨益三追述白纸坊群众控诉恶霸“南霸天”的经过，反映群众对恶霸的切齿痛恨。市协商委员会副主席、国民党革命委员会北京市分部常务委员会召集人宁武对公安部门破获美蒋间谍网的工作，表示赞佩。他站在民主党派的立场，对政府镇压反革命的政策，完全拥护。他说：“反革命分子时时刻刻都想找机会，混进人民政府的队伍，乘机进行破坏。我们中国国民党革命委员会就发现反革命分子杨守德，我们已经作了检讨。”他建议人民建立镇压网，协助政府检举反革命分子。
  反革命分子危害工商业  工商界愿协助政府镇压
    工商业联合会筹备委员会主任委员、市协商委员会委员傅华亭，北京同仁堂乐家老铺的经理、新当选市人民政府委员的乐松生，福兴面粉厂经理、市协商委员会副秘书长孙孚凌，一致拥护政府惩治反革命条例。傅华亭认为这个条例的颁布非常适时。并表示工商界愿意竭力协助政府做这个工作。乐松生对公安部门的工作同志们破获这些反革命活动的案子，减轻了人民的损失，表示谢意。他希望政府对反革命分子要按条例来惩办，不要宽容。孙孚凌回忆解放以前的情形说：工商界是反革命分子欺侮的对象，受到很大的损害。今天政府惩治反革命，我们工商界完全拥护的。他举出工商业联合会混进反革命分子来作例，说明有了反革命分子，工商业联合会的一切工作都被他捣乱。现在把他逮捕起来了，工作进行得很顺利。证明镇压反革命分子，对工商界有很大的好处。他主张凡是有命案的反革命分子都应该杀。不应该考虑杀的人数多少，只应该考虑该杀不该杀。该杀的就杀；该关的就关。
  宗教界决提高警惕性  不容反革命分子活动
    天主教徒、光华女中校长祝福祥，对政府镇压反革命的政策，表示坚决的拥护。他说，这是广大人民迫切要求、热烈欢迎的英明政策。他认为不彻底肃清那些阴谋破坏的特务分子，我们的建设基础就不能稳固。他说，就我个人所知，天主教的人士，一致认为政府颁布惩治反革命条例是正确的。教会本身虽然是纯洁的，但是有少数落后分子被帝国主义所利用，进行反人民的活动。这不但是违反教规，更是违反国法。政府严厉制裁这些败类，我们是坚决拥护的。他号召天主教教友，积极促进天主教革新运动，与帝国主义断绝一切关系，使反革命分子，无法利用宗教进行反革命活动。戒杀的佛教徒巨赞法师主张开杀戒。他说：杀反革命分子和佛教的杀戒并不矛盾。因为杀少数的反动分子，救活多数的人民，并且使犯罪的人少犯罪，这是功德。
  反革命分子罪恶滔天  对首恶分子一定要杀
    北京大学校务委员会主席汤用彤提出学校的安全问题。北京大学发现反革命分子在五四图书馆阴谋纵火，幸亏发觉得早，要不然，整个理学院都要被烧掉；还有一次是在毛主席和李大钊先生的工作纪念室写反动标语。这些事实证明不少的反革命分子混进了学校。
    市人民政府委员、民主促进会北京分会理事雷洁琼对汤用彤先生的意见表示完全同意，并且主张对已经逮捕的反革命分子，该杀的一定要杀。辅仁大学工会主席柴德赓刚从中南区参观土地改革回来。他说，他所看到的，凡是未经过土地改革的农村，反动势力非常大。在土地改革以后，群众已经起来，反革命分子都藏留不住。但是，另一方面，政府也要为群众撑腰。北京的群众起来检举反革命分子的还是少数。主要是由于政府宽大，如果政府对反革命分子严厉镇压，群众就会起来举发。燕京大学宗教学院院长赵紫宸，主张政府对反革命分子应该严厉镇压，同时人民也应负责检举。他要求基督教团体提高警惕，不要使反革命分子有空子可钻。农民代表、市协商委员会委员刘桐恩说：政府以前对反革命分子太宽大，老百姓就不敢告发。最近我们十六区抓了四十多个反革命分子，我们农民在区人民代表会议上，都提了意见，希望政府以实为实，对那些残害人民的反革命分子，赶快枪决。去年我们区杀了十一个反动分子，可是检查起来还是杀得不够。像杀了两条人命的反动分子安文波，还没有被枪决，只判了六年徒刑。大家认为太宽大。要求政府严厉惩治，中央美术学院院长、市协商委员会委员徐悲鸿热情愤激地说，这些反革命分子，罪恶滔天，“一死不足以蔽其辜”。尤其是美蒋特务阴谋案，如果不是及早破获，真不得了。人民政府不只应该逮捕他们，而且应该以重刑处死。清河制呢厂工会主席赵?沾控诉在该厂作恶的汉奸王寿隆。他说：“在日寇占领北京时，王寿隆当日本人的走狗，害死四条人命，梳纺科二百八十多个工人，没有人没挨过他的打。他强奸女工，不从的就叫狗去咬她。去年在控诉会上，当场控诉他的女工就有六个。解放后，厂长仍把他留用了，工人都不满意。抗美援朝运动开始后，工人诉苦都控诉他一个人，政府根据大家的意见，把他抓起来，生产马上就好了。公审他的那一天，每个纺车都多纺了三十斤毛线。我这次来开会，工友们对我说：“你去要求政府把王寿隆送到咱们厂子来枪毙吧。”
    师范大学学生代表彭继贤、私立新生中学学生代表范景文，都起来代表他们的同学，表示坚决地拥护人民政府惩治反革命条例。彭继贤说：一九四八年四月九日，大批特务冲进我们师范大学，把八位同学从梦中抓走。打得遍体鳞伤，血流满床，染红了校门口的马路。这种血的记忆，我们永远忘不了。他要求政府，凡是该杀的特务，有多少就杀多少。范景文也要求政府严厉制裁特务。特别是那些镇压学生爱国运动的特务。他说：我们的学校，过去是志成中学，是有名的反动学校。我也受过特务的欺骗被骗参加了三青团。后来听人说三青团是特务组织，我真想哭。我现在要求政府严厉地镇压反革命分子。中国民主同盟北京市支部委员陶大镛听了许多代表的讲话，非常感动。代表们一致要求坚决镇压反革命，他说，这是代表北京市人民的要求。他提出三点希望：第一，镇压反革命分子应和爱国运动相结合。第二，把今天看到的许多反革命分子的罪状，由公安部门编印成册，使广大的市民也可以看到。第三，有确实证据的反革命分子，应该马上正法。
  工厂的生产决不容破坏  政府应狠狠惩治反革命
    自来水公司人民工会主席、市政府委员李国瑞、铁路工会北京分区委员会副主席、市人民政府委员李永禄，历举反革命分子在北京工厂和铁道上的各种破坏活动，他们说：工人们积极生产，为国家增加财富，敌人却积极破坏生产。政府对这些人不能再犹豫了。李国瑞还建议政府，凡是证据确凿，杀人放火的反革命分子，一定要狠狠地处理。临时发言的继续不断，直到晚上九点钟才结束。最后，市协商委员会委员、中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会副主任张奚若应邀讲话。他进一步说明反革命罪恶的根源，在思想上提高大家的认识。他说：反革命活动不是偶然的，而是必然的。因为我们革命的规模太大了。过去剥削人民、压迫人民的少数人，一定会来反对我们的革命。希望他们不再来是不合客观事实的，只有想办法狠狠地打击他们才行。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中告诉我们，对这些人只有专政，就是这个道理。同时，今天中国的反革命分子形式上是从台湾派来，而实际上是美帝国主义派来的。这又是一个严重的国际斗争。因此就必须镇压得更彻底一些。我建议把今天在这里展览的国际间谍案中的各种罪证，编译成外国文，作为对美帝国主义国际斗争的宣传材料。
  彭真主席和罗瑞卿兼局长讲话  同意根据讨论的精神处理案件
    市公安局罗瑞卿兼局长在会上当场代表公安机关接受大家的意见。他说：我们要坚决镇压反革命分子。只有坚决镇压反革命活动，抗美援朝和建设工作才能顺利进行。当然，坚决镇压反革命不是不要宽大。镇压与宽大相结合的原则是绝不动摇的，二者不可偏废。但是宽大要有边，只宽大那些应该宽大的。宽大无边等于鼓励反革命，土匪特务也就永远肃不清，而且今天不杀一个，明天可能逼着我们杀三个。不坚决镇压反革命活动，就连可以争取改造的特务也难改造了。罗兼局长在讲话中解释了大家提出的一些具体问题。他指出：有人要求处刑应该重一些，这种仇恨敌人的情绪是好的。但在公安机关办案时还是应该实事求是，要不轻不重，恰当合适。
    彭真主席自始至终全神贯注地听着会议中的发言。最后他起立讲话说：今天的会开得很好。协商委员会的委员，各界代表以及政府各部门负责同志的讲话，和我们所听到的各阶层人民的意见相同，的确代表了各界人民的意见。我完全同意罗兼局长关于镇压反革命的发言，坚决镇压一切反革命活动，是对人民有利的。处理反革命案件的根据，一个是证据，一个是“惩治反革命条例”。我们应该严格地按照这两个根据办事。量刑时要不轻不重，一个也不许错杀。有一千个是该杀一千个也不多；没有一个是该杀的，即使杀一个也是杀多了，杀错了，这都是绝不应该的。经过今天这样充分的讨论，大家在听了报告并且查看了案卷证据之后，都主张坚决镇压这些反革命分子，主管部门即根据这种精神认真地、审慎地处理这些案件。
