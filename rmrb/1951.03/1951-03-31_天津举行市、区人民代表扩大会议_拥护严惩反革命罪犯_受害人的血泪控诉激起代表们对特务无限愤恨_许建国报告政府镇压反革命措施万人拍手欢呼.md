　　Tianjin Holds City and District People's Representatives Enlarged Meeting
    Supporting Severe Punishment of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals
    Victims' Bloody Accusations Arouse Representatives' Infinite Hatred of Special Agents
     Xu Jianguo Reports on Government's Measures to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries to Ten Thousand People's Applause
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Tianjin City and District People's Representatives Enlarged Meeting was held at 2:00 PM on the 29th at Minyuan Plaza to discuss the issue of punishing counter-revolutionary criminals. More than 15,000 people attended, including representatives from all sectors of the city and districts, members of democratic parties, representatives of people's organizations, and representatives from various agencies, factories, and schools. The meeting listened to and discussed the report by Xu Jianguo, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, on the city's severe suppression of counter-revolutionary activities. After citizens and their families who had suffered from persecution by special agents and local bullies made accusations on the spot, the Municipal People's Government, accepting the opinions of the representatives present, had the Municipal Public Security Bureau escort a group of counter-revolutionary criminals who had committed heinous crimes to the venue. The representatives unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish this group of criminals with deep blood debts, resolutely support the government's implementation of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, and passed a resolution.
    After the meeting adopted the presidium, Executive Chairman Huang Huoqing delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that in order to implement the Central People's Government's Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, Tianjin had arrested a group of counter-revolutionary criminals. He said, "This is a great victory in the struggle against the enemy since the liberation of Tianjin." He pointed out that the people of Tianjin support the government's measures, and many citizens have reported counter-revolutionary elements to the government, and some have even assisted the government in arresting special agents. In order to enable the broad masses of citizens to better understand the government's policies and the criminal facts of the counter-revolutionary elements, and to seek the opinions of the representatives present on how to punish these counter-revolutionary elements, this meeting was convened. He said, "This is a meeting of the people's democratic dictatorship."
    Subsequently, Director Xu Jianguo listed the counter-revolutionary crimes of the arrested principal culprits who had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for a long time, those who continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, bandits, local bullies, and heads of reactionary secret societies engaged in espionage activities, and asked the representatives present to review them. Director Xu also explained in detail the government's policy, which has always been the basic policy of combining leniency with suppression, and this was the case in the past and is still the case now. When Director Xu Jianguo reported, more than 10,000 representatives present shouted passionate slogans, one after another, shaking the venue and repeatedly interrupting Director Xu's report. They repeatedly shouted: "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries! Assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries! Shoot the special agents who have committed heinous crimes! Shoot the local bullies! Shoot the heads of reactionary secret societies!" Finally, Director Xu Jianguo assured the representatives present: "We will never let the arrested counter-revolutionary elements come out to oppress the people at will, we will never wrongly kill a single person, and we will never let a single counter-revolutionary element go unpunished. This is because we are the people's government under the leadership of Chairman Mao, with clear rewards and punishments." The venue unanimously applauded enthusiastically, shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Support the correct leadership of the People's Government!"
    Citizens and their families who had been devastated and persecuted by special agents and counter-revolutionary elements at the venue could not wait to vent the resentment that had been pent up in their hearts for many years. A total of five people took the stage to make accusations on the spot: Wang Shuyun, Liu Liu Shi, Old Lady Liu, worker Sun Liancheng, and worker Cao Shizong. When they made their accusations, they were all in tears, gnashing their teeth, and recounting the crimes of these heinous counter-revolutionary elements. After Wang Shuyun saw the news in the newspaper that the government had arrested the special agent and local bully Wang Shijiang, she specially rushed from Beijing. When she made her accusation on the stage, the scene of the murder of her brother eleven years ago was still vivid in her mind, and she cried bitterly. The representatives under the stage also shed tears because of Wang Shuyun's grievances, and everyone's heart was filled with boundless anger towards the special agents and local bullies. Wang Shuyun was extremely excited when she talked about how the People's Government had avenged the people. She shouted, "The government has turned us over from hell!" She repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" to express her grateful and excited feelings. Old Lady Liu Liu Shi fainted on the spot when she accused the special agent and local bully Jing Yijiang (Jing San) of his crimes. When Old Lady Liu accused the special agent and scab Liu Jinfu, she cried so much that she could not speak. She said, "I ask the government, is it okay to keep Liu Jinfu?" The crowd under the stage unanimously shouted "No!" When tram company worker Sun Liancheng made his accusation on the stage, he clenched his fists with both hands and said forcefully, "I thank the government for its good leadership, long live Chairman Mao!" When the accusation was in progress, every representative at the venue was saddened by the accuser's grief and excited by the accuser's excitement. The venue kept shouting: "Shoot the unrepentant special agents! Shoot the principal counter-revolutionary elements! Avenge the revolutionary martyrs! Avenge the victims!"
    After the accusations, the Municipal People's Government accepted the requests of the representatives present and had the Municipal Public Security Bureau escort a group of counter-revolutionary criminals to the venue. This group of principal counter-revolutionary elements included the Kuomintang special agent Lu Yimin who murdered General Ji Hongchang, the murderer of the Xuezhai Village massacre, Zhu Shiyin, the Kuomintang Tianjin Municipal Party Department Executive Committee and Central Unification special agent Yuan Baohuang, the special agent and local bully Wang Shijiang, Liu Jinfu, Li Tianran, the traitor special agent Gao Tiehou, and the head of the Yiguan Dao, Wang Ziquan, and 14 others. This group of counter-revolutionary elements who had committed many evils, harmed the people, and did not know how to repent, turned pale in the face under the angry eyes of the masses at the venue. When each criminal's name was called, the masses unanimously shouted angrily, "Shoot him!"
    Then, representatives from all walks of life, Yu Songru, Li Zhuchen, Yang Shixian, Wang Lancheng, Wan Yuqing, and Ye Ganghou, spoke at the meeting one after another. They all unanimously supported the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and demanded that the government severely suppress counter-revolutionaries.
    After the representatives from all walks of life spoke, Wang Xiaoyi, Chief of the Military Law Office of the Tianjin Military Control Commission, spoke. He said: "The Military Law Office will definitely resolutely implement the resolutions of the conference and ensure that the great work of punishing counter-revolutionaries is done well." He also said: "The preparatory work for sentencing this group of counter-revolutionary criminals has been completed, and the legal procedures have been completed. As long as the meeting makes a resolution, it can be executed immediately." At this time, there was a burst of warm applause at the venue.
    Finally, Mayor Huang Jing spoke. He said: In the past two years, Tianjin has not implemented Chairman Mao's policies very well. Sometimes the suppression of the principal counter-revolutionary elements has not been timely enough, and sometimes leniency has gone too far. The people have criticized us. We sincerely accept this criticism. In the future, we will definitely accept the opinions of the representatives, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, strengthen the unity of the people, and protect democratic rights. Mayor Huang Jing also hoped that all the representatives present would raise their vigilance against counter-revolutionaries. Finally, Mayor Huang Jing said: "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not only a matter for the government, but also the result of the assistance of the broad masses of the people. On behalf of the government, I thank you for your support. Thanks to the support of the people, we have successfully suppressed counter-revolutionaries."
    Finally, the meeting unanimously passed the resolution on severely suppressing counter-revolutionary elements.

    【本报讯】天津市市、区各界人民代表扩大会议，二十九日下午二时在民园广场召开，讨论惩治反革命罪犯问题。共出席市、区各界人民代表、各民主党派党员、各人民团体代表及各机关、工厂、学校代表一万五千余人。会议听取并讨论了天津市公安局许建国兼局长关于天津市严厉镇压反革命活动的报告。在遭受特务、恶霸迫害的市民及家属当场进行控诉后，市人民政府接受到会代表的意见，由市公安局将已逮捕的一批罪大恶极的反革命罪犯押到会场。到会代表一致要求人民政府严厉惩办这批血债深重的罪犯，坚决拥护政府执行惩治反革命条例，并通过了决议。
    会议通过主席团后，执行主席黄火青致开幕词。他指出为了执行中央人民政府的惩治反革命条例，严厉镇压反革命活动，天津市逮捕了一批反革命罪犯，他说：“这是天津解放以来，对敌斗争中的一个伟大胜利。”他指出天津市的人民都拥护政府的这个措施，很多市民向政府检举反革命分子，有的还协助政府逮捕特务，为了使广大市民更清楚的了解政府的政策和反革命分子的罪恶事实，并希到会代表讨论如何惩治这些反革命分子，所以召开这个大会。他说：“这是人民民主专政的大会。”
    继由许建国兼局长报告，他列举已逮捕的长期进行反革命的首恶分子，解放后仍然怙恶不悛继续作反革命活动的分子、匪首、恶霸及反动道会门进行特务活动的头子等的反革命罪状，请到会代表审查。许兼局长并详细说明政府的政策，从来就是宽大与镇压相结合的基本政策，过去是这样，现在也是这样。当许建国兼局长报告时，一万余到会代表，高呼激昂的口号，此起彼落，震撼会场，屡次打断了许兼局长的报告。他们一再高呼：“坚决镇压反革命！协助政府肃清反革命！枪毙罪大恶极的特务！枪毙恶霸！枪毙反动会道门头子！”最后许兼局长向到会代表保证说：“决不让已逮捕的反革命分子随便出来欺压人民，决不错杀一个人，也决不让一个反革命分子逍遥法外。这是为我们是毛主席领导下的人民的政府，赏罚分明。”会场一致热烈鼓掌，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“拥护人民政府的正确领导！”
    在会场上曾经遭受特务、恶霸反革命分子摧残迫害的市民和家属都恨不得把多年闷在心里的怨气，一下子吐出来，当场上台控诉的计有：王淑云、刘刘氏、刘老太太、工人孙连城和工人曹士宗等五人。他们在控诉时，无不声泪俱下，咬牙切齿，历数这些万恶反革命分子的罪行。王淑云在报纸上见到政府逮捕特务恶霸王士姜的消息后，特地从北京赶来，她在台上控诉时，十一年前的杀兄冤仇的情景，历历在目，痛哭失声，台下的代表们也都因王淑云的冤仇而流泪，每个人心中都燃起对特务恶霸的无边怒火。王淑云在讲到人民政府为人民报了仇时，极为激动，她高呼：“政府叫我们从地狱里翻了身！”她以不断的高呼“毛主席万岁”来表示她感激兴奋的感情。刘刘氏老太太在控诉特务恶霸井义江（井三）的罪行时，当场哭得晕了过去。刘老太太控诉特务工贼恶霸刘金富时，哭得连话也说不上来了，她说：“我请问政府，刘金富留着行不行？”台下群众一致高呼“不行！”电车公司工人孙连城在台上控诉时，两手捏紧了拳头，用劲的说：“我感谢政府领导得好，毛主席万岁！”当控诉进行时，会场上的每个代表都因控诉者的悲愤而悲愤，因控诉者的兴奋而兴奋。会场上一直不断发出“枪毙怙恶不悛的特务！枪毙首要反革命分子！为革命烈士报仇！为受害人民报仇！”的怒吼。
    在控诉之后，市人民政府接受到会代表的要求，由市公安局将一批反革命罪犯，押解到会场。这批首恶反革命分子有杀害吉鸿昌将军的军统特务吕一民、潘家峪血债的凶手朱世荫、国民党天津市党部执委中统特务苑宝璜、特务恶霸王士姜、刘金富、李天然、汉奸特务高铁侯、一贯道大头子王紫泉等十四人。这批作恶多端、残害人民、不知悔改的反革命分子，在会场上群众的怒目之下，一个个面无人色。当喊到每个罪犯名字时，群众一致愤怒高呼“枪毙他”。
    接着由各界代表于松如、李烛尘、杨石先、王兰城、万玉清、叶刚侯陆续在会议上发言。他们都一致拥护惩治反革命条例，要求政府严厉镇压反革命。
    各界代表发言后，由天津市军事管制委员会军法处王笑一处长讲话。他说：“军法处一定坚决执行大会的决议，保证作好惩治反革命的伟大工作。”他并说：“判决这一批反革命罪犯的准备工作已经做好，法律手续已经完备，只要会议作出决议，立即就可以执行。”这时，会场上响起一片热烈的掌声。
    最后由黄敬市长讲话。他说：过去二年来，天津没有很好的执行毛主席的政策，有时对首恶的反革命分子镇压得不够及时，有时宽大过了火，人民批评我们。我们诚恳接受这个批评。今后一定接受各位代表的意见，坚决的镇压反革命，加强人民的团结，保障民主权利。黄敬市长并希望各位出席代表提高对反革命的警惕心，最后黄敬市长并说：“镇压反革命决不单是政府的事，而是广大人民协助的结果，我代表政府感谢你们的支持，由于人民的支持，才胜利地镇压了反革命。”
    最后会议一致通过了关于严厉镇压反革命分子的决议。
