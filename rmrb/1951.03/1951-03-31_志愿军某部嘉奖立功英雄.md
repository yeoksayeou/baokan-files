Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th - The leadership of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued an order to award Chen Desheng and Ye Yong'an, who had established meritorious service in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, the honorary titles of "Lone Hero" and "Anti-Tank Hero," and posthumously recognized the late artillery squad leader Kong Qingsan as a "People's Hero."

During the Changjin Lake Campaign last year, "Lone Hero" Chen Desheng single-handedly broke into the enemy's阵 (zhèn - battle array, position, camp), destroyed three American tanks, and killed three enemies. On the night of December 5th, the unit Chen Desheng was in was ordered to block the retreating enemy in Xixingli. When they encountered enemy tank units, his left cheek was injured, and he lost contact with his squad. After bandaging himself, he thought, "A revolutionary soldier does not leave the line of fire with minor injuries; where there are enemies, that's where I'll fight!" He immediately held a grenade in his right hand and carried a rifle in his left, rushing towards a tank. As he approached the tank, he threw the grenade, setting the tank on fire. However, fragments from the grenade also injured the right corner of his mouth. At this moment, an enemy tank gunner emerged from the turret and fired two shots at him, one hitting his sight and the other piercing his left middle finger and grazing his wrist. Enduring the pain, he angrily raised his gun and fired, and the enemy fell onto the tank. He then took out a second grenade and quickly moved to the rear of the second tank. The grenade exploded, and that tank also began to smoke. As he was preparing to attack the third tank, he ran out of grenades. He quickly ran to the north side of the road, found a grenade on an American corpse, and ran towards the rear of the third tank. The grenade exploded on the tank again. At this time, an enemy's head popped out of the top of the second tank. Chen Desheng, forgetting that the enemy did not understand Chinese, shouted, "Don't move! Don't move!" The enemy was so frightened that he retreated back inside. Chen Desheng immediately rushed forward. But suddenly, an enemy lunged at him and fired a shot, missing his target. He returned fire, knocking down the enemy. Suddenly, that damned enemy tank gunner poked his head out for the second time, looking around stupidly. At that moment, Chen Desheng happened to reach the tank, raised his gun, and shot the enemy dead on the tank. By this time, day was breaking, and he was alone in the enemy's 阵 (zhèn - battle array, position, camp), when a bullet wounded him in the neck. This was Chen Desheng's fifth injury. Finally, he returned to his unit. After recovering from his injuries and returning to the team, this hero told everyone, "When fighting the American aggressors, we must greatly develop the spirit of single-handed combat; this is what the enemy fears most."

The 8th squad leader of a certain unit, "Anti-Tank Hero" Ye Yong'an, and his combat team destroyed three enemy tanks and one jeep during the battle of Xinxingli. As they braved the enemy's firepower blockade and crawled across the snow towards the road, they encountered a jeep leading twelve tanks rushing towards them. Ye Yong'an immediately ordered the soldiers to fire together, destroying the leading jeep and blocking the tanks behind. Ye Yong'an and his comrades quickly crawled in close. When they were a dozen meters from the tanks, he gave a command, and three grenades were thrown at the enemy simultaneously. The tank tracks were immediately damaged, and the screaming tank machine guns and cannons were silenced. The enemy on the tanks behind, seeing the fire in front, opened the turret hatches to observe. Ye Yong'an ordered the soldier Kan Litian to throw a grenade. Kan Litian's grenade accurately landed inside the turret, and the tank immediately burst into flames. Ye Yong'an seized the opportunity to rush towards the third tank. He ordered the soldiers to fire a volley of grenades. Taking advantage of the smoke, Ye Yong'an quickly placed a package of explosives. Immediately, the tank flipped into a ditch in an explosion. A column of American tanks blocked behind was also destroyed five vehicles by soldiers from another unit.

Martyr Kong Qingsan was the 5th Infantry Gun Squad Leader of a certain unit. During the encirclement and annihilation of the enemy in Xinxingli, the troops ordered to attack the enemy encountered obstacles on their advance. The enemy, entrenched in a detached house, repeatedly blocked our assault troops on their advance route, affecting the overall situation. At this time, the 5th Infantry Gun Squad was ordered to clear the way for the troops. Squad Leader Kong Qingsan braved the enemy's firepower and led the entire squad to push the cannon up the mountain ridge on the snow, until they were only twenty meters away from the enemy, preparing to set up the cannon for firing. However, they encountered significant difficulties here. The ground was frozen rock, making it impossible to build fortifications. The left bracket tail of the infantry gun, which had enormous recoil, rested on the rock, but because the terrain was uneven and there were no sandbags, the right bracket tail could not reach the ground. If it were fired like this, the shells would not hit the target. In this urgent situation, the entire plan to annihilate the enemy rested on the firepower of this cannon. The commander had already issued the order to fire, and time was of the essence. At this moment, the hero Kong Qingsan stepped forward and said, "I will hold down the cannon bracket tail; fire immediately!" He used an iron shovel to brace the bracket tail, used his shoulder blades to brace the shovel handle, and ordered the gunner to fire. The gunner, Ge Huidong, knew that the gun position was within the effective range of the cannon, and the cannon's massive recoil would surely crush him. He turned around and hesitantly looked at Kong Qingsan, saying, "Squad Leader, you...". Kong Qingsan knew what he was going to say, and immediately calmly and seriously ordered him again: "Fire! Fire! Don't worry about me, completing the mission is the most important thing!" Then, with a loud roar, the cannon shell destroyed the firepower position of the thirty-plus enemy troops guarding the detached house. The assault troops surged into the enemy's阵 (zhèn - battle array, position, camp), annihilating all the defending enemies. The hero Kong Qingsan thus gloriously sacrificed his life. The unit therefore specially posthumously recognized Comrade Kong Qingsan as a "People's Hero."

### 志愿军某部嘉奖立功英雄

　　志愿军某部嘉奖立功英雄
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】我国人民志愿军某部领导机关发布命令，授给在抗美援朝保家卫国战争中建立功勋的陈德生、业永安以“孤胆英雄”及“反坦克英雄”的光荣称号，并追认已故炮兵班长孔庆三烈士为“人民英雄”。
    去年长津湖战役中，“孤胆英雄”陈德生只身闯入敌阵，击毁三辆美国坦克，并打死三个敌人。十二月五日夜间，陈德生所在的部队奉命在西兴里阻击南逃之敌。在遭遇敌人坦克部队的时候，他的左脸腮负了伤并和他的班失掉了联系。他自己包扎好后，心里想：“革命战士轻伤不下火线，那里有敌人就向那里打！”他立刻右手握着手榴弹，左手提着步枪，迎着一辆坦克冲去。在靠近坦克时，他扔出了手榴弹，把坦克炸得起火。但手榴弹的碎片又炸伤他的右嘴角。这时，一个敌坦克手从炮塔里钻出来，向他连打了两手枪，一枪击中他的标尺，一枪射穿了他的左手中指，并擦伤了他的手腕。他忍着痛愤怒地举枪射击，敌人应声倒在坦克上。他又拿出了第二枚手榴弹，很快地转到了第二辆坦克的后面。手起弹落，那辆坦克又冒起了烟火。这时，他正准备去打第三辆坦克，但手榴弹没有了。他很快地跑到公路北边，在一个美军尸体上找到了手榴弹，又朝着第三辆坦克的后面跑去。手榴弹又在坦克上爆炸了。这时，第二辆坦克顶上探出一个敌人的脑袋。陈德生忘记了敌人不懂中国话，大喊“不要动，不要动！”。敌人被吓得又缩了进去。陈德生立刻冲上去。可是迎面一个敌人向他扑来，向他打了一枪，没有打准。他顺手还了一枪，打倒了这个敌人。突然那个该死的敌坦克手第二次又探出头来，傻头傻脑地在东张西望。这时陈德生恰巧赶到坦克旁，举枪一击就把敌人打死在坦克上。此时，天快亮了，他孤身一人在敌阵中，一颗子弹又打伤了他的脖子。这是陈德生第五次负伤。最后，他终于回到了自己的部队。这位英雄伤愈归队后告诉大家说：“跟美国侵略军作战，要大大发挥独胆作战的精神，这是敌人最害怕的。”
    某部第八班班长、“反坦克英雄”业永安与他的战斗小组，在新兴里战斗时，击毁敌坦克三辆、吉普一辆。当他们冒着敌人的火力封锁，在雪地上爬近公路时，迎面就遇到一辆吉普车带领十二辆坦克冲来，业永安立即命令战士一齐射击，击毁了前面的吉普车，挡住了后面的坦克。业永安和他的同伴迅速爬进。在距坦克十几公尺时，他一声号令，三枚手榴弹一齐投向敌人，坦克履带立即被打坏，狂叫着的坦克机枪和炮也被打哑了。后面坦克上的敌人，见前面起火，掀开塔盖了望。业永安命令战士阚立田投弹。阚立田的手榴弹准确地落进塔盖里，坦克立即燃烧起来，业永安趁机向着第三辆坦克扑去。他命令战士打了一排子手榴弹。趁着弹烟弥漫，业永安迅速送上一包炸药。立刻，坦克在爆炸声中，翻下沟里去。被拦在后面的一列美国坦克，也被另部战士们击毁了五辆。
    烈士孔庆三，是某部第五步炮班班长。在围歼新兴里敌人时，奉命向敌人攻击的部队，在前进道路上遇到阻碍。据守在一个独立家屋的敌人，数次把我突击部队封锁在前进道路上，使全局受到影响。这时，步兵炮第五班奉命替部队扫清道路。班长孔庆三冒着敌人火力，带领全班在雪地上把炮推上山岭，一直到离敌人二十几公尺的地方，准备架炮射击。但是，在这里他们遇到了重大的困难。地面是冰冻的岩石，没法修筑工事。有着极大后座力的步兵炮的左架尾靠在岩石上，因为地势不平又没有沙袋，右架尾却靠不到地。如果这样发射，炮弹就无法射击命中。在这紧急的情况下，全部聚歼敌人的计划，都落在这门炮的火力上。指挥员已经下达了开炮命令，时间已经不容迟缓。这时，英雄孔庆三即挺身而出：“我来压住炮架尾，马上开炮！”他用铁锹抵住架尾，用肩胛抵住锹柄，命令炮手开炮。炮手戈会东知道，炮位是在本炮威力圈内，而且炮的巨大后座力一定会把人压碎。他回过头来，迟疑地望着孔庆三说：“班长，你……。”孔庆三知道他会讲什么，立刻镇定而严肃地再次命令他：“打！打！不要顾虑我，完成任务要紧！”于是，一声巨响，炮弹摧毁了独立家屋的三十多守敌的火力阵地。突击部队应声汹涌冲进敌阵，歼灭了全部守敌。英烈的孔庆三就这样的光荣牺牲了。该部为此特追认孔庆三同志为“人民英雄”。
