In Xiangxiang, Daoxian, Cili and other counties of Hunan Province, incidents of special agents and unlawful landlord elements sabotaging warehouses have been discovered in succession. On the evening of February 2nd, the management cadres of the Huangnihu Warehouse in Sile Township, Xiangxiang County, discovered a bottle of explosives with fuses attached at the foot of the back wall of the warehouse. On the eve of the Lunar New Year, the landlord He Weidao sneaked into the bottom of the No. 5 Warehouse in Daoxian County and set fire to the warehouse. Fortunately, the militia discovered it in time, caught the landlord, and the grain was not damaged. He Xiong, a landlord in the Third District of Hengyang County, diverted water into a public grain warehouse, causing the loss of 6,000 jin of public grain. In the Jiangya area of Cili County, a long-term lurking special agent was discovered attempting to carry out illegal activities such as burning warehouses. On January 25th, the militia guarding the Wulidui branch warehouse in the area discovered a suspicious person active near the warehouse. When they approached to question him, the bandit left behind an igniter and fled. Later, with the help of the masses, five special agents were arrested one after another. It was learned that these special agents had been lurking in Jiangya for two months, disguising themselves as cobblers during the day and engaging in sabotage activities such as burning warehouses at night. On the evening of February 10th, the Fourth District of Linli County discovered eighteen special agents in six boats attempting to rob the warehouse in the district. The militia discovered them, pursued them, and captured five special agents, seizing five rifles and one radio. On February 9th, a special agent arson attack occurred at the Yintian Township warehouse in the Twelfth District of Leiyang. After investigation by the masses, the principal offender, Peng Yixuan, and his accomplice, Peng Chuanyao, were arrested. The principal offender, Peng Yixuan, has been executed according to law.

From the above incidents, it is once again illustrated that the enemy is preparing to attack the people at all times. However, many cadres are still paralyzed and careless about this. For example, the management cadres of the Qiyang Baishui Warehouse went out to work, neither leaving anyone at home nor locking the door, leaving four rifles and documents and accounts at home. Some militia guarding warehouses have ruffians and vagrants mixed in. These paralyzing thoughts must be overcome.

　　湖南连续破获特务烧仓库案件
    部分干部的麻痹思想亟须克服
    湖南湘乡、道县、慈利等县，连续发现特务、不法地主分子破坏仓库事件。湘乡县思乐乡黄泥浒仓库管理干部于二月二日晚，发现该仓库后院墙脚有装好引线的炸药一瓶。道县第五仓库在农历除夕深夜，有地主何维道钻入仓底，放火烧仓，幸为民兵及时发现，将该地主捉住，粮食未受损失。衡阳县三区地主何雄，引水灌入公粮仓内，使六千斤公粮受了损失。慈利县江垭地区还发现长期潜伏特务，企图进行烧仓等非法行为。一月二十五日该地五里堆分库护库民兵发现仓库附近有一形迹可疑的人活动，近前盘问时，该匪遗下引火物逃走。后来在群众协助下先后抓住五个特务，始知这些特务在江垭潜伏已有二月之久，白天伪装皮匠，夜间即进行烧仓等破坏活动。临澧县四区于二月十日晚发现特务十八名驾船六只，企图抢劫该区仓库，经民兵发觉尾追，捕到特务五名，缴获步枪五支，收音机一部。耒阳十二区荫田乡仓库，二月九日发生特务放火烧仓事件，经群众多方调查，终将主犯彭易铉、从犯彭传耀等逮捕到案。主犯彭易铉已依法予以枪决。
    从上述各项事件中，再次说明了敌人无时无刻不在准备向人民进攻。但是，仍有不少干部对此麻痹大意。如祁阳白水仓库管理干部外出工作，既不留人在家，又不锁门，把四支步枪和文件账目等留在家里。某些仓库护仓民兵有地痞、流氓混入。这些麻痹思想，亟应加以克服。
