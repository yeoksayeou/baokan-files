In December 1950, most grassroots trade unions in Chongqing achieved significant results in leading production, generally fulfilling or exceeding their plans. For example, the average spindle draft (output per spindle per 20 hours for 20-count yarn) of the Fushi Yarn Factory increased by 1.001 pounds, greatly exceeding the original target of 0.94 pounds. The Yuxin Yarn Factory, which had the worst production, also increased to 0.74 pounds (from 0.64 pounds). The Yufeng Yarn Factory, which had failed to meet its plan for three consecutive months from September to November last year, also completed its plan. State-owned Factory 29 completed its annual task, and the steel production efficiency in December last year increased sixfold compared to September last year. Minsheng Machinery Factory, Yuxin Iron and Steel Factory, and Factory 29 challenged each other to manufacture bridge components, and all three factories completed the task in less than the planned time. The Minsheng Machinery Factory completed a project originally planned for 70 days in only 28 days. The other two factories completed their plans more than 30 days ahead of schedule. The No. 1 Power Plant also completed its task of saving coal consumption. Most grassroots trade unions in Chongqing adopted different methods to organize and stimulate the workers' production enthusiasm based on specific circumstances. For example, state-owned Factory 29, Factory 50, the No. 1 Power Plant, and the 503 Automobile Factory used the method of establishing collective contracts. In factories such as the 503 Factory and the Fushi Yarn Factory, rationalization proposal campaigns were launched. In factories such as the Fushi Yarn Factory and the Yufeng Yarn Factory, mass production competitions were initiated. The grassroots trade unions in most factories in Chongqing achieved results in this production campaign and also gained some experience.

Only when workers' political awareness is raised and their sense of ownership is enhanced can the successful completion of production plans be guaranteed. The great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the great victories on the Korean front inspired the production enthusiasm of workers throughout the city, which enabled them to strive to complete production plans. During the same period, state-owned Factories 20, 21, 31, and 50 successively launched mass anti-espionage struggles, convened mass rallies to denounce the crimes of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and secret agents, and enhanced the political awareness of the masses. The Fushi Yarn Factory strengthened mass political education, which played a significant role in stimulating mass production enthusiasm. The Yufeng Yarn Factory learned from the failure of past production competitions, the administration made a self-criticism to the workers, and changed its style of not respecting workers' opinions, making the workers feel that they were truly the masters, and their production morale was also improved. Last December, they were able to keep up in the production campaign.

In organizing production, grassroots trade unions must use diverse methods to consolidate the production morale of the workers. The Fushi Yarn Factory and the Yufeng Yarn Factory commended advanced producers and elected model workers. The Yufeng Yarn Factory enriched the material rewards, making the workers experience the alignment of production with their own interests.

To promote further development of production, grassroots trade unions must encourage employees to use their brains and improve technology, and not use the old methods of working overtime to boost production. Workers at Factory 29 submitted 97 rationalization proposals from September to December last year. Taking only the 22 that were rewarded as an example, they added a considerable amount of wealth to the country. The Second Branch of Factory 50 used to work overtime but still could not complete its plan, but in December last year, it abolished overtime, signed a collective contract, and instead overfulfilled its task, increasing production by 50% compared to November last year. However, in the small and medium-sized factories of Chongqing's machinery industry, overtime is still prevalent, which should be corrected quickly.

Currently (mid-February this year), there is a serious tendency towards formalism in the general trade union organizations in Chongqing. Grassroots committees rarely hold meetings, and when they do, they are not democratic and lack mass participation. In addition, the trade unions' understanding of the basic content of production, that is, facing the workers, is not deep enough, and they are weak and powerless in leading mass production. In terms of trade union cultural and educational work, although the study of the current situation of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea has been carried out, the results are not significant due to the trade unions' insufficient attention to this aspect, issuing calls without specific arrangements, and failing to seize the time to universally launch denunciation movements. These are all to be gradually improved in the production campaign.

### 重庆工会工作有进步

　　重庆工会工作有进步
    一九五○年十二月重庆市大多数基层工会在领导生产上获得了很大的成绩，一般的都完成或超过了计划。例如：孚市纱厂的平均锭扯（每二十小时二十支纱每锭产量）提高达一点零零一磅，大大超过了原定零点九四磅。生产最差的渝新纱厂，也提高到了零点七四磅（原为零点六四磅）。去年九月至十一月连续三月不能完成计划的豫丰纱厂，也完成了计划。国营二十九厂完成了全年的任务，去年十二月份钢铁生产效率较去年九月份增高六倍。民生机器厂、渝鑫钢铁厂和二十九厂为制造桥梁而挑战，三个厂都不到预定的时间，就完成了任务。民生机器厂原计七十天的工程，只做了二十八天就完成了。其他两厂提前三十多天完成了计划。第一发电厂节省煤耗也完成了任务，重庆市大多数厂的基层工会，对生产的领导方法是根据具体情况采用不同的方式去组织与发挥工人生产热情。例如国营二十九厂、五十厂、第一发电厂、五零三汽车厂等，是用订立集体合同的方式。在五零三厂、孚市纱厂等，展开了合理化建议运动。在孚市纱厂、豫丰纱厂，发动了群众性的生产竞赛。重庆市多数工厂的基层工会在这次生产运动上获得了成绩，也得到了一些经验。
    只有当工人政治觉悟提高和主人翁实感增强，才能保证生产计划的胜利完成。伟大的抗美援朝运动和朝鲜前线的巨大胜利，鼓舞着全市工人的生产热情，这就使得全市工人能为完成生产计划而努力。在同一时期国营二十分厂、二十一厂、三十一厂、五十厂等，先后展开了群众性的反特务斗争，召开了群众性的控诉美帝国主义和蒋介石的土匪和特务罪行的大会，提高了群众的政治认识。孚市纱厂加强了群众政治教育工作，对于群众生产积极性的激发，起了重大的作用。豫丰纱厂接受了过去生产竞赛失败的教训，行政向工人作了检讨，改变了不尊重工人意见的作风，使工人群众觉得真正作了主人，生产情绪也得以提高，去年十二月在生产运动中才没有掉队。
    基层工会在组织生产中，必须以多样的方式去巩固工人群众的生产情绪，孚市纱厂和豫丰纱厂表扬了先进生产者，选举了模范；豫丰纱厂充实了实物奖励，使工人体验到生产与自己利益的一致。
    基层工会要推动生产进一步发展，必须鼓励职工开动脑筋，改进技术，不能用加班加点的旧方法来搞生产。二十九厂工人自去年九月至十二月曾提出合理化建议九十七件，单以其中给了奖的二十二件而论，即为国家增加了很大一笔财富。五十厂二所过去一直加班，还是完不成计划，但在去年十二月废除了加班，订立了集体合同，反倒超额完成了任务，较去年十一月增产百分之五十。但是重庆市机器业的中小工厂里，仍旧盛行着加班、加点，是应迅速纠正的。
    目前（今年二月中旬）重庆市一般工会组织存在着很严重的形式主义偏向，基层委员会很少开会，开会也不民主，没有什么群众参加，加之工会对面向生产的基本内容就是面向工人的观点体验不深刻，在领导群众生产上，就表现得软弱无力。在工会文化教育工作方面，虽然进行了抗美援朝的时事学习，但由于工会对这一方面注意不够，发了号召而无具体布置，没有抓紧时间普遍展开控诉运动，所以工作成绩不大。这些都是要在生产运动中逐渐改进的。
