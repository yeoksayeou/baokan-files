    Explanations of Cultural Relics and Historical Sites Should Use Popular Language

    During the Spring Festival, I went to visit the Temple of Heaven. I first went to the Hall of Sacrificial Vessels. Just as I entered, I saw a wooden sign that read: "In the early Qing Dynasty, the sacrificial vessels mostly followed the Ming Dynasty system. The sacrificial vessels used for suburban sacrifices existed in name only, and were mostly replaced by cheaper substitutes. In the thirteenth year of the Qianlong reign, a special order was given to court officials to discuss reforming the ancient system. All vessels were made according to the ancient vessels of the Three Dynasties to match the name and reality. The winter solstice of that year was when sacrifices were first offered in the Circular Mound Altar." The explanations of the various sacrificial vessels in the hall were also in classical Chinese, without punctuation. For example, the explanation for a sacrificial vessel called "Fu" was: "Fu: Square shape, porcelain, surface is [unclear character], dragon pattern, foot pattern is cloud, two ears attached with [unclear character] dragon. The lid has edges, also attached with [unclear character] dragon, ears filled with rice and millet."

    How can the working people understand such explanatory text? In order to conduct further investigation and research, I stood next to the wooden sign at the entrance and asked every worker or farmer who came in, "Comrade, do you understand it?" I asked more than twenty people, and their answers were either a shake of the head or, "I can recognize a few characters, but I don't understand the overall meaning." I also asked three first-year junior high school students, and they also said they didn't understand. So, this kind of explanatory text is clearly only understandable to a very small number of people.

    The Temple of Heaven was created by the working people and was once exclusively occupied by feudal emperors. Now it has returned to its true owners – the working people. It is for the working people to visit and is loved by the broad masses of the working people. However, the cultural relics and historical sites displayed in the Temple of Heaven are still explained with such decadent and difficult-to-understand language, which is deliberately making things difficult for the masses. This kind of negligence is probably not limited to the Temple of Heaven alone. I hope that the relevant responsible departments will quickly correct this, annotate it with plain language that is easy for the masses to understand, and explain its content from a revolutionary point of view.

    文物古迹应用通俗话来说明
    春节中我去游天坛。先到祭器陈列室，刚进门，看见一个木牌上这样写着：“清初祭器率沿明制郊祀所用祭器徒存其名多以资盘代之清乾隆十三年特饬廷臣议更古制各器均按三代旧器仿造以符名实是年冬至在园丘设祭即开始用之”。室内各种祭器的解释也都用文言文，也不断句。比如一个名叫“簠”的祭器，解释是：“簠：形方、瓷质、面为?、纹龙、足纹为云，两耳附以?龙。盖有棱、亦附?龙、耳实以稻粱。”
    劳动人民怎能看懂这样的介绍文呢？为了作进一步的调查研究，我就站在进门处的木牌旁边，见走进一个工人或农民来，我就问：“同志，看懂了没有？”我问了二十多人，他们的回答不是摇摇头，就是说：字能认识几个，整个意思不懂。我又问了三位初中一年级的同学，他们也说看不懂。那末，这种解释文字显然只有极少数的人才能看得懂了。
    天坛是劳动人民所创造的，过去被封建帝王所独占，现在回到它真正的主人——劳动人民的手里来了。它为劳动人民游览，为广大的劳动人民所喜爱。可是在天坛陈列的文物、古迹，还用这样腐朽而难懂的文字来解释，真是有意与人民大众作难了。这种疏忽恐怕不限于天坛一处。我希望有关负责部门，赶快把它改正过来，用人民大众易懂的白话文来注释，用革命的观点来解释它的内容。
