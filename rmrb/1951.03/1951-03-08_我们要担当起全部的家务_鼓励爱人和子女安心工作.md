　　We Must Shoulder All the Household Chores to Encourage Spouses and Children to Work with Peace of Mind

To the Editor:
    I am a housewife. As the people of the whole country are engaged in the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, and are joyously celebrating the second "March 8th" International Women's Day since the founding of the Central People's Government, I have a few words to say.
    In New China, we women have already turned over and are on an equal footing with men in society. We must resolutely fight for this right and obligation and not fall behind. We women in the family must constantly encourage our spouses and children to participate in various patriotic actions. We must be diligent and thrifty, manage household affairs, be careful in planning, live within our means, and consolidate the family economy. We must comfort the elderly, educate our children, and maintain family harmony. We must ensure that our spouses and children have no worries about their families, no matter what position they are in. We must shoulder all the household chores so that they can work hard to serve the people with peace of mind. This is to wash away the humiliation of the old society's saying about women: "Marry a man to get clothes and food."

　　我们要担当起全部的家务  鼓励爱人和子女安心工作编辑同志：
    我是一个家庭妇女。在全国人民进行着伟大的抗美援朝、保家卫国的斗争中，欢度中央人民政府成立后第二个“三八”妇女节，我有几句话要说出来。
    在新中国里，我们妇女们已经翻了身，在社会上与男子处在平等的地位，我们一定要坚决争取这个权利和义务，不能落在后面。我们在家庭中的妇女们，必需要经常的鼓励爱人和儿女，参加各种的爱国行动。勤俭操作，主持家务，精打细算，量入为出，巩固家庭经济。安慰老人，教育子女，和睦家庭。让自己的爱人和儿女们，无论在什么岗位上，都不要有家庭后顾之忧。我们要担当起全部家务，使他们能安心努力为人民服务。以洗清旧社会对妇女“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的污辱。
