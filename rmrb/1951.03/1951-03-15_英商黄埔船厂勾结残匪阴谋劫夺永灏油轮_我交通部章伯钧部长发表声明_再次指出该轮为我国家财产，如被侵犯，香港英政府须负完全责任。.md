Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Minister Zhang Bojun of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government issued the following statement on the 14th regarding the British-owned Huangpu Shipyard in Hong Kong colluding with remnant bandits in Taiwan in a conspiracy to seize the Yonghao tanker:

　　The Yonghao tanker, currently being repaired in the dock of the British-owned Huangpu Shipyard in Hong Kong, originally belonged to the former state-owned Shanghai China Tanker Company. This former Shanghai China Tanker Company was taken over by the Central People's Government after the liberation of Shanghai and became an institution under the jurisdiction of the Central People's Government. All the employees of the Yonghao tanker, led by Shao Liang, the former supervisor of the Yonghao tanker stationed in Hong Kong, announced their uprising in Hong Kong on April 1, 1950. On June 29th, Wang Bingnan, General Manager of the Shanghai China Tanker Company under the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, replied with commendation on behalf of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government and accepted them. Shao Liang, the former supervisor, was appointed to continue as supervisor, and Zuo Wenyuan was appointed as captain. The above information was published in Hong Kong newspapers on December 18, 1950, and was released by Xinhua News Agency on January 18 of this year. Therefore, the fact that the Yonghao tanker is the national property of the People's Republic of China and is under the direct jurisdiction of the Shanghai Tanker Company of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government should have been a universally known fact.

　　According to reliable information from Hong Kong, the British-owned Huangpu Shipyard, which is repairing the Yonghao tanker, is actually colluding with remnant bandits in Taiwan to raise the issue of the Yonghao tanker's ownership in the Hong Kong court at this time when the tanker is about to be completed, in a vain attempt to seize this 15,000-ton tanker so that it cannot return to China to serve the people after its repair.

　　The Central People's Government is paying serious attention to this shameless conspiracy to seize the national property of the People's Republic of China.

　　In the "Statement on the Property Rights of Chinese Merchant Ships Remaining in Hong Kong and Singapore" published on March 18, 1950, I solemnly declared: "The sacred property rights of these vessels of our Central People's Government should be respected by the British government in Singapore, the British government in Hong Kong, and the governments of all countries. If there are any acts of infringement, damage, detention, transfer, or interference with the vessels in the ports of Singapore, Hong Kong, and all countries, the governments concerned must bear full responsibility and will cause corresponding consequences." Due to the shameless conspiracy of the Huangpu Shipyard in Hong Kong colluding with remnant bandits in Taiwan in an attempt to illegally seize the Yonghao tanker, I cannot but once again call the attention of the British government in Hong Kong to this statement.

　　英商黄埔船厂勾结残匪阴谋劫夺永灏油轮
    我交通部章伯钧部长发表声明
     再次指出该轮为我国家财产，如被侵犯，香港英政府须负完全责任。
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府交通部章伯钧部长十四日为香港黄埔船厂勾结台湾残匪阴谋劫夺永灏油轮事，发表声明如下：
    目前正在香港英商黄埔船厂船坞中修理的永灏油轮，原属前国营上海中国油轮公司所有，该前上海中国油轮公司已于上海解放后为中央人民政府所接收，成为中央人民政府管辖下的一个机构。永灏油轮全体员工在原任永灏轮驻港监工主任邵良领衔下，于一九五○年四月一日在港宣布起义；六月二十九日由中央人民政府交通部所属上海中国油轮公司王炳南总经理代表中央人民政府交通部电复嘉勉，予以接受，即委原任监工主任邵良继续担任监工主任，并派左文渊为船长。上述各节曾经刊载于一九五○年十二月十八日的香港各报，并由新华社于本年一月十八日发布消息。因此永灏轮之为中华人民共和国的国家财产，并受中央人民政府交通部上海油轮公司的直接管辖，这应该早已是举世周知的事实。
    近据香港确息，修理永灏油轮的英商黄埔船厂，际此油轮即将修理完工之时，竟勾结台湾残匪阴谋向香港法院提出永灏油轮的产权问题，妄图劫夺这一艘一万五千吨的油轮，使其不能于修竣后驶返中国来为人民服务。
    中央人民政府对于这一劫夺中华人民共和国国家财产的无耻阴谋正予以严重注意。
    在一九五○年三月十八日发表的《关于我国留在香港及新加坡的商船产权的声明》中，我曾郑重声明：“我中央人民政府对于这些轮只的神圣产权应受到新加坡英国政府、香港英国政府、和各国政府的尊重。如果在新加坡、香港和各国港口的各轮，有被侵犯、损坏、扣留、转移、或干涉行动等事情，则各该政府必须负完全责任，并将引起相应的后果”。由于香港黄埔船厂与台湾残匪勾结企图非法劫夺永灏油轮的无耻阴谋，我不能不再一次提请香港英国政府对于这一声明的注意。
