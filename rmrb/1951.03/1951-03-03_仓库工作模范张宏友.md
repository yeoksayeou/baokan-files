　　Warehouse Work Model Zhang Hongyou
　　Zhang Hongyou is one of the special-class models at this Shandong Provincial Labor Model Conference. He is a worker in the weaving parts warehouse of the Qingdao State-Owned No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory. He is twenty-six years old this year, and an excellent member of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. He was transferred to work in the weaving parts warehouse last June. In the past six months, due to the improvement of his political awareness, he has demonstrated a high degree of initiative and created many exemplary deeds. Before he arrived, the management work of the No. 8 Factory weaving parts warehouse was very chaotic. This phenomenon was manifested in unclear numbering of parts, disorderly arrangement, failure to distinguish between new and old, inconsistent specifications, incomplete parts, one item placed in several places, or several types mixed together, etc., which delayed machine repair and leveling for an unknown amount of time, increased the leveling rate, and reduced production. After Comrade Zhang Hongyou arrived, under the leadership of the administrator, he first started with numbering and arrangement. All the looms in Factory No. 8 are Japanese Toyota automatic looms, with more than 700 kinds of parts, totaling more than 1,500 kinds when divided into new and old categories, all of which are replaced by numbers instead of names. He classified each category according to the original numbers, so that the material distribution workers could take them in the order of arrangement after receiving the material requisition form, reducing the material distribution time from several tens of minutes to no more than two minutes. Errors in the number of parts also rarely occurred. For example, at the end of June, 135 errors were found during inventory, while at the end of December, there were only 5 minor errors. Because he also separated the new and old parts in each category, he tried to issue old parts first when issuing materials, and regularly inspected the old parts. Those that were unqualified were repaired in time. The number of old parts used in the second half of last year was about twice as many as in the first half of the year. He also established a sample cabinet in the warehouse to display various samples, so as to prevent the parts from being out of shape. Due to his scientific management, work efficiency has been improved.
    Because of his orderly arrangement of equipment, it is easy to find out what materials are missing; because accessories are replenished in time, the parking rate is reduced. Assuming that the number of stoppages is reduced by one machine per day, more than 600 more pieces of cloth will be produced in a year. The actual number is more than this. All the staff of the weaving workshop praised the work of the weaving parts warehouse. Maintenance technician Wu Jiaju said: "Zhang Hongyou is really willing to work! Since he came to the weaving parts warehouse, materials can be received as soon as they arrive, and there has never been a delay. Our maintenance department feels very convenient. He is never late or leaves early. When we arrive at the workshop, he has already opened the window waiting to issue materials."
    Before he entered the warehouse, old parts worth RMB 475,505.159 yuan were piled up in the warehouse without being sorted out, most of which could be used or could be used after processing and repair. After he thoroughly sorted them out, he picked out those that could be used, worth RMB 374,324.121 yuan; those to be processed and repaired were valued at RMB 45,497.432 yuan; and those that were truly scrap were only worth RMB 55,383.606 yuan. There were hundreds of discarded C-38 springs, which were foreign goods and of great value. He cut off the damaged parts of these springs and changed them to shorter K-67 springs for use. Zhang Hongyou not only works and studies hard himself, but also helps other comrades solve difficulties in learning and work.
    Due to the above-mentioned exemplary deeds, he was honorably elected as a special-class labor model to attend the Provincial Labor Model Conference.

　　仓库工作模范张宏友
    张宏友是这次山东全省劳动模范大会特等模范之一。他是青岛国营第八棉纺织厂仓储课织部配件库的一个工友。今年二十六岁，是一个优秀的共产党党员、青年团员。去年六月调入织部配件库工作。半年来，由于政治觉悟的提高，发挥了高度的积极性，创造了许多模范事迹。八厂织部配件仓库，在他去之前，管理工作非常混乱。这种现象表现在配件的编号不清、排列不顺、新旧不分、规格不一、残缺不齐、一种东西放置数处、或数种混在一起等方面，不知耽误了多少修机、平车的时间，增加了平车率，减少了生产量。张宏友同志到了之后，在管理员领导下，首先就从编号和排列工作着手。八厂的布机全是日本丰田自动式的，所有配件七百余种，分新旧类别计有一千五百余种，都以号码代替名称。他根据原来的号码逐一分清类别，使发料工人接到领料单后，即可按排列次序拿取，使发料时间，从以前的数十分钟，减少到不超过两分钟。配件数量也很少发生错误，如六月底盘存发现了一百三十五种错误，十二月底盘存就只有五种小小的错误。由于他还把每种配件内的新旧分开，发料时尽量先发旧品，对旧品经常加以检验，不合格者及时予以修理，去年下半年比上半年使用旧品数约多一倍。他还在库内建立一个样品柜，专门陈列各种样品，以免配件走样。由于他的科学管理，提高了工作效率。
    由于他对器材编排有序，那样材料缺少，很易查明；由于及时补充配件，停车率降低了。假定每天以减少停车一台计，一年要多产布六百多匹。实际尚不止此数。织布场全体职工对织配库工作一致称赞。保全技师吴家钜说：“张宏友真肯干！自从他到织配库以后，领料的随到随领，向来未耽误过。我们保全部都感到非常方便。他向来不迟到早退，我们到车间的时候，他早已开着窗等着发料了。”
    在他入库前，库内堆积着价值人民币四七五、五○五、一五九元的旧配件没有清理，其中大部可以使用或加工修理后可以使用。经过他彻底清理了以后，挑出来能够使用的，计值人民币三七四、三二四、一二一元；待加工修理的计值四五、四九七、四三二元；真正成为废品的仅值五五、三八三、六○六元。有几百个废弃不用的Ｃ三十八号弹簧，是外国货，价值很大，他便把这些弹簧机坏的地方割去，改为较短的Ｋ六十七号的弹簧使用。张宏友不但自己努力工作和学习，还帮助别的同志解决学习和工作上的困难。
    由于以上的模范事迹，这次他光荣地当选为出席全省劳动模范大会的特等劳动模范。
