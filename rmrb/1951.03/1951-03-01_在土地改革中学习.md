　　Learning from the Land Reform
    Xiao Qian

　　At the beginning of this year, I had the opportunity to participate in a vigorous land reform in Gangkou Township, Yueyang County, Hunan. I climbed upwards for more than thirty years, from a carpet shop in the northeast corner of Beijing all the way to a noble college in Cambridge. The higher I climbed, the emptier, more vulgar, and more distant from reality I became, and the heavier my burden grew. This time, it was the first time I consciously climbed downwards. This was the first time I shed the airs of an intellectual, moved my bedding into a poor peasant’s home, ate from the same pot and slept on the same bed as the peasants. The winter nights in the countryside are already long, and to save firewood and lamp oil, we would lie down around seven o’clock when there were no meetings—with a young peasant who made a living by doing odd jobs, lying for twelve hours straight. From his mouth, I learned how the Kuomintang bandit gang conscripted soldiers and how the bloodsuckers, the landlord class, exploited people through compound interest. His painful past was a living history book itself. Unfortunately, my trip was only forty-two days, and such life only accounted for about ten days, but these were the richest, most vivid, and most unforgettable ten days of my life. In those ten days, I felt more than once that the past thirty years had been lived in vain. Only when I truly leaned towards the people did I realize the essence of the old Chinese society where people ate people, and only then did I see the people's endless wisdom and great strength. Seeing that great strength strengthened my great confidence in the future of the motherland and the future of world peace.

　　In the past, I had also gone to the countryside: at the age of fourteen, as an admirer of the Japanese reformist Toyohiko Kagawa, I had been to Xianghe in eastern Hebei and Caiyu in southern Beijing, teaching the "Common People's Thousand-Character Lessons" and advocating drinking boiled water and killing flies. When I was a reporter in the old society, I also "interviewed" the floods in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu, watched hundreds of thousands of people rush to block the Yellow River, and also visited the working masses building the Yunnan-Burma Highway. In order to reduce the distance with the peasants, I also wore straw sandals and took off my glasses, but emotionally, I had never been as close to the peasants as this time. Now that I think about it, the distance was not because I was a scholar and they were peasants, but mainly because my intentions were unclear. When I went to the countryside as a child, it was to "relieve" them; later, when I became a reporter, I was ostensibly "pleading" for them, but deep down, the boss who sent me was to increase the newspaper's circulation, and I myself was to collect material to climb the ladder in the literary world!

　　This time when I went to the countryside, I also restrained my intellectual airs beforehand, but after arriving in the countryside, I realized that it was completely unnecessary. As a member of the land reform work team, I quickly became close to the peasants.

　　The morning of January 25th is a morning I will never forget, a glorious morning, but also a morning that made me deeply ashamed. That day, we set off to return to Changsha. The peasants of the village, led by the militia, lined up to send us out of the village, beating gongs and drums, shouting slogans, and setting off firecrackers. The old and the young insisted on sending us another twenty *li*. What had I done for them to deserve such a grand send-off? However, the peasants' minds are exceptionally broad. They distinguish between friend and foe more than they calculate gains and losses. They sent us off mainly because we were wearing cadre uniforms. In their eyes, that was enough, because everyone wearing a uniform was sent by Chairman Mao.

            The Peasants' Greatness

　　The kindness, purity, and fervor of the peasants in the land reform are truly remarkable! Their love and hate are as distinct as sunshine and rain. In trivial matters, they seem to be more obtuse than intellectuals—they are even less likely to be hypocritically polite; but in crucial matters, they are meticulous. When they struggle, they are resolute to the end; when they repair dikes, they refuse to stop even when the sun sets. They also have contradictions between public and private interests—that is, contradictions between immediate and long-term interests—but they handle those contradictions with clarity and decisiveness.

　　A poor peasant named Gu Haitao in Gangkou Street helped others farm in the first half of the year and made a living as a porter in the second half of the year. From Gangkou to Yueyang County, sixty-five *li*, he earned 20,000 yuan per hundred *jin*. He had to support his mother, wife, and an older sister who was in the process of getting a divorce with that income. The land reform period was the time he should have been making a living by carrying goods, but he was elected as the head of the first group of the farmers' association and the militia squad leader in the town. For more than a month, day and night, attending this meeting and that meeting, patrolling at night, struggling, seeing that there was nothing to eat at home, he could not take on business. During this period, the family lived by borrowing three *sheng* from the east and half a *dou* from the west. He rushed to the front in doing things, and he was willing to be in the back in land distribution. When he was allocated a piece of farm equipment, he was both grateful and seemed a little surprised. When asked what to do about the grain he owed, he replied readily, "Chairman Mao is helping us peasants to stand up, what is there to worry about!"

　　The masses who are thoroughly mobilized ideologically are indeed the best executors of policy. This is because upright peasants are fair and serious about things everywhere. When the landlord Yu Ziqiang was struggled against in Guanjia Village, his son (eleven years old) also stood in the crowd, carrying a basket with some cigarettes and sweets inside. Jianjun brand cigarettes cost 2,400 yuan for twenty sticks in the town, and he sold them retail for 200 yuan per stick. A loafer argued with the child to buy cigarettes, scolding him: "You landlord's son, your father is being struggled against here for exploitation, and you still dare to exploit here!" The child cried. At this time, some peasants came out to arbitrate, saying, "He is a young child, he cannot be classified as a landlord. If he sells them expensively, you can choose not to buy. This is industry and commerce!"

　　At another struggle meeting, the object of the struggle was a landlord's wife—a female landlord. Her husband was an idiot. She had another lover in the house. They lived upstairs, putting the idiot downstairs, and abused him everywhere. Before the struggle, the peasants decided to only struggle against the landlord's wife who controlled the finances, and not against the idiot. During the struggle, a cadre from an intellectual background repeatedly tried to dig into the root of her "adultery" and asked her questions like "Who sought whom first?" Afterwards, most of the peasants raised objections, believing that the struggle should focus on political reaction and economic exploitation, and not on private feelings.

　　What clear, delicate, and calm policy thinking!

　　The most touching thing was that before the liberation rally, the work team convened a criticism meeting for the members of the farmers' association. It was originally intended to ask the peasants to give feedback to the cadres, but as a result, after giving feedback, the peasants immediately began to self-criticize one by one. One admitted that in the early stages of the land reform, he had eaten a meal from the village landlord (his clan uncle), but fortunately, he had not protected him in his actual work. Another peasant said: I'm sorry to Chairman Mao, I am a member of the farmers' association, but when assessing the output, I took advantage of it and assessed it five *dou* lower! Everyone spoke sincerely and painfully.

            Servants of the People

　　In addition to the peasants, the comrades from the province, county, district, and township I met along the way were also my teachers. From them, I realized to what extent a cadre should be loyal to the revolution. From them, I specifically learned how to be a servant of the people.

　　They—are old cadres from North China. Many of them, at the age of fifteen or sixteen, left their hometowns to resist the Japanese invaders and started guerrilla warfare. They were tempered and improved in the guerrilla war, becoming the backbone of the revolution. In the Anti-Japanese War and the Self-Defense War, they had all persevered in the struggle while risking their lives, carrying out the arduous land reform work under the enemy's artillery fire.

　　They—are old cadres from Hunan Province, who have been organizing, operating, and continuing the revolutionary flames ignited in the era of the Great Revolution around the strongholds of the reactionaries since 1927. Wrapped in hundreds of "Liberation Books," they entered and exited Changsha under the rule of the reactionaries.

　　They—are countless new cadres, small and medium-sized intellectuals in Hunan, many of whom are from landlord or rich peasant classes. After being transformed by revolutionary schools, they resolutely stood on the side of the peasants in their hometowns, carrying out land reform work to eliminate feudal forces with the spirit of placing righteousness above family ties. They are undergoing intense tests and are also radiating intense brilliance.

　　They are all wearing uniforms that are neither blue nor purple, with backpacks and umbrellas on their backs. In their chest pockets are a fountain pen and a toothbrush. On their belts are water bottles, flashlights, and that infinitely useful sheepskin towel. During the day, it can be used to wipe their faces and sweat, and at night, it can be dried and used as a pillow. In windy and snowy weather, it can be pulled up from the chin and buttoned with a hat to become an earmuff scarf. They have no fixed office hours. In the land reform, they even have no fixed beds. They specifically choose to live in the homes of poor peasants. During the assessment of production and land distribution, many people did not close their eyes for four days and nights. Their two meals are both coarse rice and a pot of radishes and peppers without oil. They work hard, live happily, and rarely use "we" among themselves—they all use "us."

　　They—the old and new cadres have rarely been to Beijing or seen Chairman Mao. They miss Chairman Mao eagerly and yearn for Beijing. As long as they are around a charcoal basin and listen to someone from Beijing talk about Beijing, it is as if they have eaten a luxurious banquet—but they are never full. They are interested in everything. How wide is Tiananmen Square "exactly," is Chairman Mao "too tired." When there is no meeting in the evening, they will "dream travel" to Beijing, because even the old cadres went south before the southwest was completely liberated.

　　Writing this in such a general way, I actually have a series of real people and events in my mind. Those people and things have moved me, shamed me, and urged me to strive to be a good servant of the people.

            The Overall Reality

　　Land reform is like catching demons: the demon is the feudal force that has oppressed the Chinese people for thousands of years. In the land reform, we first see the demons reveal their true forms. The peasants' accusations at the struggle meetings are like mirrors, stripping the feudal landlord class of its "elegant" and "charitable" cloaks, revealing its cruel, greedy, and despicable true colors: a landlord forced a peasant to sell his wife and children for a few silver dollars of debt, and tied the peasant to the ancestral hall to be stepped on; some even colluded with bandits or puppet *baozhang*, and even massacred people. *Wuchang*—the natural unit of the rural areas in Hunan, mostly inhabited by people of one or two surnames—were fortresses of deep-rooted feudal rule before land reform. There, the landlord class exercised cruel and strict rule over the poor peasants through ancestral halls dating back dozens of generations and through all kinds of superstitious societies.

　　Then came the subduing of the demons! Landlords who had blood debts and were especially hated by the masses were shot on the spot after public trials. What had been exploited and extracted was to be returned to the fullest extent possible. The demons—the landlord class—who had been running rampant for thousands of years, who had lived by eating human flesh and sucking human blood, tried their best to escape in the land reform, but were finally suppressed by the righteous peasants. When a tyrannical landlord was brought to justice, how happy the peasants were, as if a thorn had been pulled out from the bottom of their hearts!

　　In the land reform, the principle of the people's democratic dictatorship is very clearly laid out before our eyes, not at all ambiguous. The entire land reform process vividly illustrates: why we should revolt, for whom we should revolt, and against whom we should revolt. Yesterday and today are clearly distinguished. Those who bullied people yesterday are being watched today; those who were ridden on the neck yesterday are in charge today. Years of exploitation and oppression have carved painful wrinkles on the faces of the peasants. In the land reform, those wrinkles are being smoothed by the happiness of their hearts, because the poor and landless peasants, who were the most despised in the countryside yesterday, are now the leading class with the stiffest backbones, the strongest organizations, and the most powerful voices.

　　For the peasants, who account for the vast majority of the country's population, today is "democracy" because today they have their own government; the landlord class, who have always been unscrupulous and lived by forcing people to death, are the object of "dictatorship" today. This is the unambiguous reality.

　　Grasping this overall reality, many of the usual trivial questions about land reform are readily solved. It is absolutely impossible for a new landlord class to emerge. After the widespread and in-depth storm of land reform, even three-foot-tall children in the countryside know that "feudal exploitation" and "not working" are unforgivable sins. The polygonal rice paddies in southern China eloquently explain why agricultural production can only be modernized on a large scale in the future by taking the socialist road. The promotion of various mutual aid organizations during and after land reform has laid a solid foundation for a greater tomorrow.

            Dividing Gold Furnace

　　Participating in land reform is the most concentrated learning of revolutionary experience, because land reform is the most comprehensive manifestation of the struggle between revolutionary truth and feudalism.

　　As a movement that progresses from point to surface in a wave-like manner, it is the most precise and meticulous organizational work that achieves qualitative change through quantitative change. Land reform requires a high degree of spirit of serving the people. In this earth-shattering great movement, every step must proceed from reality. From beginning to end, the mass line is implemented. Grasping such a complex, acute, and major mass movement, one must both let go of the masses and prevent possible deviations at any time; one should appropriately satisfy the peasants' immediate economic demands and take care of the peasants' long-term political interests.

　　Land reform is especially a dividing gold furnace for tempering class standpoints.

　　After participating in a land reform, I realized that I had been to the front line of anti-feudalism and fought an intense ideological battle. Only when you are truly on the battlefield can you understand the impossibility of "watching the battle from the air," and only then can you understand why a soldier who cannot distinguish between friend and foe and whose gun barrel is turned around should not be allowed to mix in the ranks. Only then can you understand why good and evil, like love and hate, cannot be supra-class.

　　A female militia member from a poor peasant family heard that a landlord in the village had escaped. She immediately picked up her spear and insisted on searching and arresting him that night. She made an appointment with two partners and set off. It was snowing heavily, and the mountain roads were covered. A pair of straw sandals she was wearing broke, and she simply chased after him barefoot. Finally, she found him in an inn. She went in first alone. The landlord initially thought that she was a woman and did not pay much attention to her. When he saw that there were two more people standing outside the door, he wanted to jump out of the back window. She grabbed his collar. In desperation, the landlord bit her arm—and bit off a piece of flesh, dripping with blood. But she shouted for the patrollers outside to come in, while still holding on tightly; as a result, the three of them tied up the landlord and escorted him back to the village.

　　Seeing the poor and landless peasants' determination to fight against the landlords, I am even more convinced of the working class's natural leadership in the revolution by allying with the peasant class.

            Uprooting the Old Roots of the Reactionaries

　　Before departing, my understanding of the relationship between the current land reform movement in China and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was very narrow and vague. I only wanted to interview the families of the volunteers and believed that only stories like the comfort bags embroidered by rural women in Hunan for the volunteers, or a peasant donating a telescope left behind by Japanese devils during the occupation to the Korean People's Army, could be considered related to the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Tracing back to the root, this is still because my political level is too low and the remnants of the bourgeois news perspective are at work.

　　But on the day of the liberation rally, seeing the peasants clapping their hands and jumping for joy, like a thousand-year-old iron tree blooming—especially when burning the land deeds, the peasants were as happy as if they were burning the contracts of their ancestors; seeing the peasants' determination to build and defend the motherland at the militia rally and the military recruitment rally on the dam, I understood that the entire land reform movement and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea are inextricably linked. The two are the same war—fighting against the counter-revolutionary forces.

　　For thousands of years, the landlord class has cruelly ruled, exploited, and oppressed the peasants. The puppet *baojia* system based on the "Gentry Representatives' Association" is even more of a bloody organization of collusion and joint rule between the landlord class and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for more than twenty years; Chiang's bandits protected the landlords, giving them the freedom to exploit and oppress, and the landlords helped Chiang's bandits to conscript soldiers and collect taxes. During the occupation, before land reform, some landlords secretly took their land deeds to photo studios to take photos and keep them as records. A landlord in Gangkou Township even fantasized, falsely creating a sales contract to "sell" the land to the tenants, and forced the tenant to write a note stating that "after Chiang Kai-shek returns, the land will belong to the original owner." Since liberation, especially when American imperialism landed in Incheon, the landlord class spread many rumors, saying that atomic bombs had fallen in the Northeast, killing 190,000 people with one bomb; saying that Chiang Kai-shek had arrived in Hankou; saying that the Third World War was about to break out. Judging from the landlords' activities and remarks after liberation, they, the bandit gang huddled in Taiwan, the demon McArthur sitting in Tokyo, and the robber barons in the White House, are all speaking with one voice. If the American imperialism being annihilated by the Chinese and Korean people's armed forces in Korea is the head of the snake, then the landlord class being eliminated on the mainland is the tail of the snake. Currently, we are cutting off the head and tail, uprooting the old roots of the reactionaries, so that they will never have internal support. Is there anything more closely related to the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea than this?

　　At the same time, the peasants, who account for 80 percent of China's population, who are familiar with every blade of grass and tree in the vast land of China, have become conscious, organized, and armed. The weight of a thousand *jun* has been lifted from their backs. Those who had no fields to cultivate and no houses to live in for generations now have land, houses, and farm tools. They have shattered the feudal chains of thousands of years and have become masters from slaves. This fact has greatly changed our motherland.

　　For thousands of years, the vast Chinese peasants have been opposed to the government. Today, the peasants have their own government. For thousands of years, the peasants have been separated from the land they cultivate. In good years, the land barely fills their stomachs; in lean years, the land becomes their torment because the landlords force them to pay rent. After the land reform, the land has returned to its old home, and whoever plants it harvests it. For the first time in thousands of years, the peasants and the land have become one.

　　When the peasants in every county, every township, every village, and every *wuchang* are organized and armed, our motherland becomes an impregnable fortress. The organized peasants built a dike in fifteen days that was higher, wider, and more solid than the one built by the Kuomintang in ten years. In order to curb the spread of reactionary forces, they will surely perform even more amazing miracles in building the great dike to defend world peace.

　　在土地改革中学习
    萧乾
    今年年初，我有机会参加湖南岳阳县筻口乡一场轰轰烈烈的土地改革。我向上爬，爬了三十几年，由北京东北城角一间地毯房一直爬到剑桥一座贵族学院，愈爬人愈空虚，庸俗，愈爬离现实愈远，愈爬包袱愈重。这番是我第一次有意识地向下爬。这是我第一次放下知识分子的臭架子，把铺盖搬到一个贫雇农家中，和农民一只锅吃饭，一个床困觉。农村的冬夜本来就是漫长的，为了省柴省灯油，不开会时我们约摸七点便躺下了——同一个靠做零工吃饭的年青农民，一躺就是十二个钟头；由他嘴里，我知道了刮民党匪帮是怎样抽丁，吮血鬼——地主阶级是怎样利上滚利地剥削。他的痛苦的过去，本身就是一本活历史。可惜我的行程只有四十二天，这样的生活又只占十来天，然而这是我一生最丰富，最生动，最难忘的十来天。在那十来天中，我不止一次感到过去的三十几年是白活了。只有当我真心靠拢人民以后，我才认识到旧中国那个人吃人的社会的本质，我才看到人民无穷尽的智慧和壮大的力量。看到了那壮大力量，使我对祖国前途，对世界和平前途，都加强了莫大信心。
    以前，我也下过乡：十四岁上，做为一个日本改良主义者贺川丰彦的崇拜者，我便去过京东香河，京南采育，教过“平民千字课”，提倡过吃熟水，杀苍蝇。在旧社会做记者时，我也曾“采访”过鲁西苏北的水灾，看十万人抢堵黄河，也踏访过建筑滇缅公路的劳苦大众。为了减少与农民的距离，我也曾穿过草鞋，脱过眼镜，然而感情上，我从来没有同农民如这次这样亲热过。如今想来，那个距离倒不是因为我是念书人，他们是农民，而主要是因为我的来路不明。我小时下乡，是为了“救济”他们；后来当了记者，表面上是为他们“伸冤求情”，骨子里，派我去的老板是为了增加报纸销路，我自己呢，是为了搜集素材，好在文坛上登龙！
    这一回下乡，事先我也收敛了一下我的知识分子的行套，但是到了农村不久，便发觉那完全是不必需的。做为土地改革工作队的一员，我很快就同农民亲热起来。
    一月二十五日那天早晨，是我永远不能忘怀的一个早晨，一个光荣的早晨，但也是使我深深惭愧的一个早晨。那天我们动身回长沙。一村的农民，由民兵领头，排了队把我们送出村外；敲锣打鼓，喊口号，放鞭爆，老老少少还坚持再送出二十里。我曾为他们做了些什么，配享受那样隆重的欢送呢？然而农民的胸襟是异常宽阔的。他们区别敌我更多于计较得失。他们欢送我们，主要是因为我们是穿了干部制服下来的。在他们看来，那就行了，因为穿制服的都是毛主席派下来的。
            农民的气魄了不起
    善良，纯朴，炽热的农民在土地改革中的表现真了不起！他们的爱与恨，就像晴和雨那样截然分明。在琐碎事情上，他们显得似乎比知识分子迟钝——他们更不会虚伪的客套；但是在关键性的事情上，他们一丝也不苟。他们斗争时，坚决到底；修起堤来，太阳落山也不肯歇手。他们也有公私利益的矛盾——也即是眼前的与远大的利益的矛盾，然而他们处理起那些矛盾来，真是又明朗又干脆。
    筻口街上一个叫古海桃的贫农，他上半年帮人种田，下半年靠做挑夫吃饭。从筻口到岳阳县城，六十五里，每百斤赚两万元。靠那个，他得养活母亲、妻子，和一个正在办离婚手续的老妹。土地改革期间，正是他应该靠挑货吃饭的时候，然而他被选上了农协第一组组长，又是镇上的民兵分队长。足足一个多月，白天晚上，开这会那会，查夜，斗争，眼看着家里没的吃，他却不能接生意。这期间，一家靠东借三升，西借半斗地过日子。干事情他抢在前头，分田他愿意放在后头。分到一件农具时，他是又感激又好像有些意外。问他欠下的谷子怎么办，他爽快地回答说：“毛主席帮我们农民翻身，还有什么好愁的！”
    从思想上彻底发动起来的群众的确是政策最好的执行者。这是因为正派农民处处对事情公平而且认真。地主余子强在关家塅被斗的时候，他的儿子（十一岁）也站在人群里，胸前挎了一只菠箩，里面放了些香烟糖果。建军牌的烟在镇上是二千四百元二十枝，他打包零卖，每枝二百元。一个二流子为了买香烟和孩子吵起来，骂他：“你这个地主崽，你老子为了剥削，在这里被斗，你还敢在这里剥削！”孩子哭了。这时，一些农民出来仲裁说：“他是个细娃子，还不能划他做地主。他卖的贵，你可以不买。这是工商业哒！”
    另外一次斗争会上，斗争的对象是一个地主老婆——女地主。她的丈夫是个白痴。她自己在屋里另有一个情夫。他们住在楼上，把白痴摆在楼下，处处虐待他。斗争以前，农民决定只斗掌握财政大权的地主老婆，而不斗那个白痴。斗争时，一个知识分子出身的干部在旁一再想挖她“偷汉”的根，就问她“你们谁先找的谁？”一类的话。事后大部分农民提意见了，认为斗争应该集中政治反动和经济剥削，不应集中到私人感情上去。
    这是多么明快，细腻，冷静的政策思想！
    最动人是翻身大会前，工作队召集了农协委员们举行了个批评会。本来是请农民向干部提意见的，结果，农民在提完意见后，紧接着便一个个自我检讨起来。一个承认在土地改革初期，曾经吃过村中地主（他的族叔）一顿饭，所幸在实际工作中，他还没袒护过他。另外一个农民说：对不住毛主席，自己是农协委员，评产量时反而讨便宜，评低了五斗！一个个话说得诚恳而且沉痛。
            人民的勤务员
    农民以外，一路上遇到的省，县，区，乡里的同志们也是我的老师。从他们，我认识到一个干部对于革命应该忠诚到怎样地步。从他们，我具体地学习了怎样做人民的勤务员。
    他们——是来自华北的老干部。许多十五六岁上，为了抵抗日本鬼子的侵略，就离乡背井，打起游击。在游击战争中锻炼，提高，成为革命的中坚力量。在抗日及自卫战争中，他们都曾出生入死地坚持过斗争，在敌人的炮火下，进行艰巨的土地改革工作。
    他们——是湖南本省的老干部，从一九二七年以来，一直在反动派的堡垒四周，组织着，活动着，赓续着大革命时代燃起的革命火焰。身上裹了百八十本“翻身书”，出入反动派统治下的长沙。
    他们——是无数的新干部，湖南的中小知识分子，其中许多是地主或富农阶级出身的。经过革命学校改造后，在本乡本土，用大义灭亲的精神，坚决站在农民方面，进行消灭封建势力的土地改革工作。他们是受着强烈的考验，也焕放着强烈的光辉。
    他们一个个都是穿了一身蓝不蓝紫不紫的制服，背上背着披包和雨伞。胸袋上是一管钢笔，一把牙刷。腰带上挂着水罐，手电筒，和那用处无穷的羊肚手巾。白天可以用它来擦脸擦汗，晚上烤干了便是枕垫。大风雪天由下巴往上一兜，扣上帽子便是护耳的围巾。他们没有固定的办公时间，在土地改革中，他们甚而没有固定的床铺。他们专挑贫苦的农民家去住。在评产分田时，很多人整整四个昼夜没有闭眼。他们的两餐都是粗米饭和一盆没油水的萝卜辣椒。他们工作得紧张，生活得愉快，彼此之间很少用“我们”——用的都是“咱们”。
    他们——新老干部都很少到过北京，见过毛主席的。他们热切地想念毛主席，向往北京。只要围着炭盆，听一个北京来人说说北京，他们就好像吃了一顿豪华酒席——只是他们永远吃不饱。他们什么都有兴趣。天安门广场“到底”有多么宽，毛主席“会不会”太累了。晚上一不开会，他们就要“梦游”北京，因为连老干部也是在西南没完全解放就南下了的。
    这样概括地写，我脑子里其实是浮现着一系列的真人真事。那些人和事，一路上都使我感动，使我羞愧，使我迫切要求自己努力好好做一个人民的勤务员。
            总的现实
    土地改革有如一场捉妖：那妖便是压迫了中国人民几千年的封建势力。在土地改革中，我们首先看见妖精现露原形。农民在斗争会上的诉苦，有如一面面照妖镜，把封建地主阶级那些“风雅”“慈善”的外衣剥个光光净净，使它显出残酷、贪婪、卑污的原形：一个地主为了几块光洋的债务，竟逼得农民鬻妻卖子，把农民绑到祠堂里踩杠子；有的还勾结土匪或伪保长，动手屠杀。屋场——湖南农村的自然单位，多半是一姓或两姓人家聚居的，土地改革以前，是一座座根深蒂固的封建统治的堡垒。在那里，地主阶级通过上溯几十代的宗祠，通过五花八门的迷信会门，对贫苦农民施以残酷而严密的统治。
    接着是降妖了！有血债，群众特别痛恨的地主，在公审大会以后，当场枪毙了。剥削榨取的，要他尽其所能地吐了出来。横行霸道，嚣张了几千年，靠吃人肉，吮人血来生活的妖精——地主阶级，在土地改革中使尽了方法来逃脱，最后还是被正义的农民镇压住了。当一个恶霸地主正法时，农民是怎样快乐得如同从心尖上拔下一道刺一般！
    在土地改革中，人民民主专政的道理是异常清楚地摆在眼前了，一点也不模糊。整个土地改革过程是生动有力地说明了：为什么要革命，为谁革命，革谁的命。昨天和今天是分得清清楚楚的。昨天欺负人的，今天被看管了；昨天被人在脖子上骑着的，今天当了家。多年的剥削和压迫在农民脸上划出了痛苦的皱纹，在土地改革中，那些皱纹硬是被快乐的心情丰润起来，因为昨天在农村中最不被人看得起的贫雇农，今天硬是腰板挺硬，组织最坚强，说话最有力量的领导阶级了。
    对于占全国人口绝大部分的农民，今天是“民主”，因为今天有了自己的政府；一向为非作歹，靠逼死活人吃饭的地主阶级，今天是“专政”的对象。这是毫不含糊的现实。
    掌握了这总的现实，许多平时对土地改革的一些琐碎疑问都迎刃而解了。新的地主阶级是绝不可能出现的。土地改革这场既广泛又深入的暴风骤雨过去后，农村中连三尺童子也都知道“封建剥削”与“不劳动”是不可恕的罪恶了。江南多边形的稻田特别雄辩地说明为什么只有将来走上社会主义的道路，农业生产才能大规模现代化起来。土地改革中间和土地改革以后种种互助组织的提倡，已经为更伟大的明天打下结实的基础了。
            分金炉
    参加土地改革是革命经验最集中的学习，因为土地改革是革命真理反对封建斗争中最全貌的体现。
    做为一个由点到面，波浪式推进的运动，它是最精确周密，由量变达到质变的组织工作。土地改革要求高度的为人民服务的精神，在这翻天覆地的伟大运动中，每个步骤都必须从实际出发。从始至终，贯彻着群众路线。掌握这样复杂，尖锐，重大的群众运动，一面得放手群众，一面又得随时防止可能的偏向；一面应适当地满足农民眼前的经济要求，一面又得照顾农民长远的政治利益。
    土地改革尤其是锻炼阶级立场的分金炉。
    参加完一场土地改革，我才明白是到了一趟反封建的前线，打了一场激烈的思想仗。真正身临战场，才明白“凌空观战”的不可能，才明白为什么不应该容许一个不辨敌我，枪口掉来掉去的兵混在队伍里。才明白为什么善与恶，正如爱与恨，不可能是超阶级的。
    一个贫雇农成份的女民兵听说村中有个地主逃跑了，她马上提起梭标，坚持当晚去搜捕。她约上了两个伙伴便出发了。大雪天，山路都盖着了。脚下一双草鞋走破了，她率性赤了脚追。终于，在一家客栈里找到了。她一个人首先进去。地主最初认为她一个女流之辈，不大在意。等看到门外还站住两个，想跳后窗户。她一把勒住了他的脖领。地主情急咬住她的胳臂——而且血淋淋咬下一口肉来。但她一面喊外面巡风的快进来，一面还是死勒住不放；结果，三个人还是把地主绑起押回村去了。
    看见贫雇农对地主斗争的坚决，我就更坚信与农民阶级联盟的工人阶级在革命中当然的领导权了。
            拔反动派的老根
    出发以前，我对于目前国内进行的土地改革运动与抗美援朝的关系，思想上是非常狭窄而且模糊的，一心只想访问志愿军的家属，并认为只有像湖南农村妇女为志愿军绣的慰问袋，或是一个农民将沦陷期间日本鬼子丢下的一只望远镜捐献给朝鲜人民军一类的故事才算连系了抗美援朝。追起根来，这还是因为自己的政治水平太低，和残余的资产阶级的新闻观点在作祟。
    但是在翻身大会那天，看到农民拍手跳脚，千年铁树开了花那样地喜欢——尤其烧地契的时候，农民活像烧了几代以来的卖身契那样痛快；看到堤坝上民兵大会，参军大会上，农民对于建设祖国，保卫祖国的坚决，我明白整个土地改革运动与抗美援朝是血肉相结的。两者是同一场战争，——打的都是反革命势力。
    几千年来，地主阶级残酷地统治、剥削、压迫了农民，以“仕绅代表会”为基础的伪保甲制度更是地主阶级与蒋介石匪帮二十多年来狼狈为奸，联合统治的血腥机构；蒋匪保地主的镖，给他剥削和压迫的自由，地主替蒋匪抽丁抽税。沦陷期间，土地改革之前，有些地主曾偷偷把地契拿到照像馆去拍照留底，筻口乡有一个地主更想入非非，竟一面假造卖契，把田做为“卖”给佃户，一面又强迫那个佃户写一字据，言明“蒋介石回来后，田归原主”。解放以来，特别当美帝国主义在仁川登陆时，地主阶级造了许多谣，说原子弹掉在东北了，一颗炸死了十九万人；说蒋介石到了汉口；说第三次大战就要爆发。从地主在解放后的活动及言谈来看，它和龟缩在台湾的匪帮，坐镇东京的麦魔，以及白宫里的强盗头子，都是一个鼻孔出气。如果伸到朝鲜正被中朝人民武装歼灭中的美帝国主义是蛇头，那么，大陆上正被消灭着的地主阶级便是蛇尾。目前，我们是在掐头去尾，拔掉反动派的老根，使它永远没有了内应。还有比这个与抗美援朝关系更深切的事吗？
    同时，占中国人口百分之八十的农民，对于广大中国的一草一木都熟悉的农民，觉悟起来了，组织起来了，武装起来。千钧的重量已经从他们脊背上搬下来了。几辈子没有过田耕，没有房子住的，如今，有了田地，有了房子和农具。他们粉碎了几千年封建的锁链，由奴隶而成为主人了。这事实，使我们的祖国大大改观了。
    几千年来，广大的中国农民与政权是对立的，今天，农民有了自己的政府。几千年来，农民与其所耕种的田地是分了家的。丰年，土地把他们的肚皮勉强填个半饱；歉年，为了地主逼租，土地反会成为他们的魔难。土地改革后，土地还了老家，谁种谁收了。农民和土地几千年来第一次打成了一片。
    当每个县，每乡，每村，每个屋场的农民都组织起来，武装起来时，我们的祖国变成铜墙铁壁了。组织起来的农民，在十五天内，把堤修得比国民党十年修得还高，还宽，还扎实。为了阻遏反动势力的泛滥，在建筑保卫世界和平的伟大堤坝上，他们必将表现更惊人的奇迹。
