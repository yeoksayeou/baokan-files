Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: London - Discontent within the British Labour Party regarding the Attlee government's current policies is steadily increasing.

The Horsham Labour Party organization in Sussex recently passed a resolution condemning the Labour Party's foreign policy, which opposes the rearmament of West Germany, protests against the plan to launch a war against China, and urges the British government to take the lead in implementing universal disarmament and removing MacArthur from his post. This resolution has received full or partial support from more than one hundred local Labour Party branches. They have unanimously requested the Labour Party's National Executive Committee to immediately convene a special meeting to discuss foreign policy. The Amalgamated Engineering Union, one of Britain's largest trade unions, has also made the same request.

On March 3rd, Labour Party members in London and Guildford, Surrey, held two separate conferences, where they unanimously and resolutely demanded a change in the government's foreign policy and the immediate convening of a special Labour Party meeting to discuss issues of peace and war. The London conference was initiated by nine Labour Party Members of Parliament and attended by over three thousand representatives from Labour Party branches and trade union branches. The conference passed a resolution expressing opposition to the rearmament of Germany, demanding the withdrawal of all troops from Korea, the return of Taiwan to China, and calling for the formulation of policies to ensure peace.

In Parliament, condemnation of Attlee's policies by Labour Party MPs is also increasing. During a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Lords one day, Labour MP Lord Strabolgi criticized British bourgeois newspapers for not publishing the recent note from the Soviet Union to the British government, saying: "This practice is disgraceful to the British people and the British government." Strabolgi attacked the British government's agreement to place the British fleet under the command of a U.S. Navy admiral, stating that this behavior "has ignited flames of anger that have been growing for a long time."

The bill on calling up reservists was fiercely criticized during debates in the House of Commons. Clause 6 of this bill, which is opposed by the vast majority of the British people, stipulates that anyone who obstructs or attempts to obstruct the call-up of reservists shall be sentenced to two years' imprisonment. During a vote one evening, thirty-two Labour MPs voted against the government's original bill and supported the amendment. Labour MP Jones, in his speech, condemned Clause 6 of the bill, stating that it would easily allow the government to throw people with dissenting opinions into prison, and increase the police's right to actively interfere with the freedom of the British people.

　　英国工党百余地方支部
    反对艾德礼现行政策
    【新华社七日讯】伦敦讯：英国工党内部对艾德礼政府现行政策的不满情绪，正在不断增涨。
    苏塞克斯郡荷沙姆的工党组织最近通过谴责工党外交政策的决议，其中反对重新武装西德，抗议进行对中国发动战争的计划，并促请英政府率先实行普遍裁军和解除麦克阿瑟的职务。这个决议已经获得一百多个工党地方支部的完全或部分的支持。它们并一致要求工党全国执行委员会立即召开讨论外交政策的特别会议。英国最大工会之一的混合机器工会也提出同样的要求。
    三月三日，伦敦和萨利郡吉尔德福的工党党员们分别举行了两个大会，会议一致坚决要求改变政府的外交政策，并立即召开工党的特别会议来讨论和平与战争的问题。伦敦的大会由九名工党国会议员发起，参加的有三千余名工党支部与工会分会的代表。大会通过决议，表示反对重新武装德国、要求一切军队撤出朝鲜、把台湾归还中国，并要求制订确保和平的政策。
    在议会中，工党议员对艾德礼政策的谴责也在不断增强。一日在上院举行的关于外交事务的辩论中，工党议员斯特拉鲍尔基斥责英国资产阶级报纸不刊登最近苏联给英国政府的照会，他说：“这种做法，对于英国人民和英国政府来说，都是不光彩的。”斯特拉鲍尔基抨击英政府同意把英国舰队交给美国海军将领指挥称：这种行为“已激起长久以来即在不断滋长的愤怒的火焰”。
    关于征召后备军人的法案，在下院辩论中受到猛烈的抨击。这一遭到广大英国人民反对的法案的第六条规定，凡所谓妨害或企图妨害征召后备军人者均处两年徒刑。一日晚进行表决时，三十二名工党议员投票反对政府原法案而支持修正案。工党议员琼斯在发言中痛斥法案第六条使政府得以轻而易举地把持有不同意见的人们投入监狱，使警察增加了积极干涉英国人民自由的权利。
