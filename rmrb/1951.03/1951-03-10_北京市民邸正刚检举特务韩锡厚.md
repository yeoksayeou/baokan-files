    To the Editorial Comrade:
    I am one of your newspaper's most loyal readers. I love our country, I love the people, and I know that our country was bought with the blood of countless martyrs, so I am always vigilant against enemies who would destroy our good days. As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult to those who put their heart into it." On the evening of the fifteenth of this month, I finally encountered a devil who had brutally murdered our patriotic people in the past – Han Xihou. Now is the time for the people to publicly try him. I cannot bear to see this murderer of the people escape justice, so I must report him to you.

    In the past, he served as a military police officer in the Tangshan Military Police Corps. After Tangshan fell to the Japanese devils, he became a traitor (plainclothes) special agent captain in the Tangshan Japanese Military Police Corps. He was called Han Da'wu, but because he committed so many evils and murders, the citizens secretly called him Han Da'hu (Han the Big Tiger). It was an appropriate nickname for a man-eater. At that time, taking advantage of the enemy's power, if he saw a woman he liked, he would rape her as easily as eating a meal. If any family refused, he would tell the Japanese Military Police that they were in league with the Eighth Route Army, and they would be taken away and never seen again. The people of Tangshan feared him like a tiger.

    Once, on the streets of Tangshan, I personally saw him (Han) lead Japanese soldiers to arrest more than twenty ordinary people, their hands tied behind their backs, looking fierce. Passersby whispered, "What's going on?" He, holding a gun, pointed at the bound people and said, "These are all special agents of the Communist bandits, desperate bandits who deserve to be shot." I didn't recognize these people, but I heard that some were good citizens, and some said they were village cadres of the Eighth Route Army. Later, I heard that these people, except for those sent to Japan as laborers, were all buried alive. This is just a small example, a drop in the ocean. There are many more things I don't know! Just ask the people of Tangshan and they will know clearly.

    After the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang bandit gang knew that he had special methods for killing Communists, investigating "Communist bandits" (the people), and dealing with "Communist bandits" (the people), and was a skilled hand, so they specially invited him to be the deputy captain of the Tangshan Military Police Corps, continuing to be a murderer of the people. After Han became the captain, I moved to Beijing. I don't know what happened after that. I heard that he only quit being a military police captain when Beijing was liberated. Today, encountering such a mortal enemy of the people still living in this world, this injustice is truly suffocating me, and it is possible that he is even mixed in with our people's organizations. I think such a mortal enemy of the people would absolutely not confess his past crimes to the people honestly, and must have other conspiracies.

    北京市民邸正刚检举特务韩锡厚编辑同志：
    我是贵报一个最忠实的读者，我爱我们自己的祖国，我爱人民，我知道我们的祖国是无数先烈的鲜血换来的，所以我时时注意与警惕破坏我们好日子的敌人。俗语说的好：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”。在本月十五日晚上那天我终于碰见了一个过去惨杀我们爱国人民的魔鬼——韩锡厚，现在是人民公审他的时候了，我决不能亲眼看见杀人民的凶手逃脱法网，所以我得报告你们。
    从前他在唐山宪兵队当宪兵，唐山陷于日本鬼子以后，他就在唐山日本宪兵队当汉奸（便衣）特务队长，他叫韩大五，因为他作恶杀人多的缘故，市民在暗地里都叫他韩大虎。这是一个吃人的绰号。那时他借着敌人的势力，看着人家的妇女好，只要他想奸，如同家常便饭，手到拿来；如要谁家不愿意，他就给日本宪兵队说他通八路，弄去就没了命，唐山人民惧之如虎。
    有一次我在唐山街上亲眼看到他（指韩）带领日本兵抓了二十多个老百姓，都背捆着手，气势汹汹，路旁有走路的小声说这是怎么回事呢？他手拿着枪，指着被捆的人说：“这都是共匪的特务，不怕死的土匪，非枪崩不可。”这些被捆的人我也不认识，听说是一部分好老百姓，还有人说是八路军的村干部，后来听说这些人，除送往日本当劳工外，都活埋了。这只是沧海一粟的小例子，其余的我不知道的还多着哩！只要去问唐山人民就能清楚。
    日寇无条件投降后，国民党匪帮知道他杀共产党、调查“共匪”（人民）对付“共匪”（人民）有特别的办法，是个能手，就特别请出他当唐山宪兵队副队长，继续做杀害人民的凶手。韩当队长以后，我就迁移北京来了，以后的事我不知道了。我听说他的宪兵队长到北京解放时才不干。我今天碰见这样的人民的死敌还活在世上，这口不平的气真闷在我心中没法出，而且可能又混在我人民机关的里边，我想这样人民的死敌绝对不肯对人民坦白过去的罪过的，一定还有其他阴谋活动。
