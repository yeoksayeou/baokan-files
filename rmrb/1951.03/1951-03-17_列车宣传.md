　　Train Propaganda
　　Chen Chunsen
　　Last summer, a new propaganda effort aimed at the broad masses of passengers began on the trains of the Tianjin Railway Bureau – train propaganda. As of now, 57 train propaganda groups (including two women's groups) have been established among the train attendant teams throughout the bureau, with over 300 staff members participating. Trains departing from Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Guihua, and other places almost all have train propaganda work. In the past ten months, propaganda has been conducted to over four million passengers. The content of the propaganda includes current events, policies, and railway common sense. Currently, the lines of train propaganda across the country have extended to many large and small cities in North China, East China, Central South China, Northwest China, and Northeast China, and its influence has actually spread to many villages along the railway lines.
　　Train propaganda is carried out jointly by train attendants, consisting of train conductors, public security officers, and car inspectors, who form train propaganda groups for "joint labor." The first to conduct train propaganda in the Tianjin Railway Bureau were Chen Gengshen and Zhao Yingcai's attendant team in the Datong area. They started this work in June 1950, initially only due to the need for train safety and passenger safety. They drew some realistic pictures of people being injured or killed from carelessness on trains, explaining railway common sense to passengers (mainly peasant passengers) to avoid or reduce accidents. During the Peace Signature and Resist America, Aid Korea movements, the Propaganda Department of the Ministry of Railways Political Department held a propaganda conference to promote their experience throughout the railway system. Each train propaganda group further enriched the content of current affairs propaganda and created many popular and lively propaganda forms, gradually making train propaganda a popular propaganda activity welcomed by the broad masses of passengers.
　　Train propaganda is carried out in coordination with the entire railway's propaganda and the country's propaganda, and the content is very rich. Train propaganda groups report the important news of the day from the newspapers to thousands of passengers every day, and introduce the People's Daily editorials. They are willing to ensure that everyone taking the train knows what major changes are happening in our country and in the world every day, and pay special attention to explaining these issues to illiterate peasant passengers. During the Peace Signature movement last year, propaganda for peace signatures was repeatedly carried out on trains. On the Beijing-Suiyuan, Beijing-Hankou, and Beijing-Shanghai lines, over 60,000 passengers signed on trains within seven days to oppose the use of atomic weapons. Since the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland movement, 47 train propaganda groups have universally launched propaganda activities in this area. They have told and sung many stories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army bravely resisting America, propagating why it is necessary to resist America and aid Korea, propagating that American imperialism can be completely defeated, and propagating what actions the Chinese people should take to resist America and aid Korea. They adopted various forms to propagate opposition to American imperialism's arming of Japan. On the Beijing-Changchun train, an old peasant, Tian Yangping, 67, after listening to the train attendant's propaganda, indignantly condemned the crimes of the Japanese fascists in slaughtering Chinese people in Yangquan in the carriage. Finally, he called on the passengers in the carriage to firmly support the just war of Resist America and Aid Korea, saying: "Young people can go to the front line. Although I am old, I can still carry stretchers. We will definitely win this just war!" The passengers next to him immediately stood up and led the entire carriage in shouting slogans for Resist America and Aid Korea. On the Beijing-Shanghai train, the young attendant team promoted after reaching Lincheng, and Mr. Du, an accountant from the Shanghai Tobacco Company, donated 6 million yuan on the spot, asking the train attendant to forward it to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Force.
　　Train propaganda groups frequently propagate the policies and decrees of the Central People's Government, such as the Land Law, the Marriage Law, the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, the Order on Banning Reactionary Taoist Sects and Secret Societies, and railway fare policies. On the Beijing-Suiyuan line, this aspect of propaganda is carried out in coordination with local work, and is aimed at marriage issues, reactionary rumors, and other issues among the peasant masses along the Beijing-Suiyuan line, using the dialects of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan for propaganda, which has achieved good results. They put a lot of effort into explaining common sense for taking the train, reducing many train accidents. In addition, they also sang some folk stories and heroic deeds of resisting America and aiding Korea. In carriages with children, they explained maternal and infant hygiene common sense to female passengers.
　　There are many forms of train propaganda, and popular and rhythmic clapper talk is the most popular. Train propaganda groups are actively studying and creating. They are full of enthusiasm and write and perform themselves. There are clapper talk, cross-talk, picture talks, single-stringed plucked instruments, singing Little Cowherd, drum storytelling, reading newspapers, and singing. Propagandists sometimes play "Three Talents" to expose the crimes of Yiguandao; sometimes they organize "Train Evening Parties" to perform dramas (such as absorbing cultural and artistic workers, soldiers, cadres, and students among the passengers to participate in the performance of "Wang Xiuluan," "Pinghan Road Little Tune," etc.). The train's broadcasting system is fully utilized in these activities.
　　Peasants taking the train are particularly interested in train propaganda. On the Beijing-Suiyuan, Beijing-Shanhaiguan, Beijing-Hankou, and Tianjin-Pukou lines, clapper talk, duets, and cross-talk are often used to cater to the preferences of peasant passengers, and peasants like them very much. After listening, they all praised it, saying, "After taking the train and listening to the performances, we also understand the major events of the country. The people's railway under the leadership of Chairman Mao is really good." On the Beijing-Suiyuan train, when promoting the land reform policy and exposing the crimes of Yiguandao, a passenger who should have gotten off at Kangzhuang did not get off, saying, "I'll leave after listening to this section." On the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line, a passenger who should have gotten off at Lutai Station also asked for a ticket to Tangshan in order to continue listening to the train attendant's propaganda. The entire peasant representative delegation from Yanbei attending the Provincial Labor Hero Model Workers Conference wrote a letter to the train attendant team, saying, "We villagers are on a special train, and you also tell us about the major events of the country, the rules for taking the train, and the bad things about Yiguandao, which makes us understand many things. We all think it's a good thing to do this, and we hope to promote this propaganda to help us villagers gain more knowledge."
　　On the train, many books, magazines, picture albums, and newspapers are also prepared for passengers, and the train attendants carefully report the news and introduce current affairs manuals to the masses. Train propaganda groups voluntarily sell books and newspapers because this is spreading cultural food among the people and is a good method of train propaganda. Many passengers buy books and newspapers. According to incomplete statistics, the Beijing attendant team sold more than 10,000 current affairs manuals and a lot of loose-leaf current affairs materials before the end of last year. From Beijing to Chang'an, a train can sell more than 400 copies of the People's Daily.
　　In coordination with train propaganda, station propaganda activities have also begun in large stations such as Beijing, Tianjin, Fengtai, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Guihua, Tangshan, and Baoding. Korean war situation maps, current affairs cartoons, big-character posters, and oral propaganda are the main forms of station propaganda.
　　Train propaganda has achieved preliminary good results. It helps the masses implement the policies and decrees of the Central People's Government, actively promotes the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, and enables millions of passengers to live a variety of political and cultural lives during their journey. It strengthens the relationship between the people and the railway. The people say: "In the past, taking the reactionaries' train was really frightening; now taking the people's train is as comfortable as being at home." Some people call the current people's train "like a school." Train propaganda has played a significant role in the safety of the railway and passengers. Since the launch of train propaganda, passenger deaths and injuries have been greatly reduced. With train propaganda, the position for conducting current affairs propaganda to the people has been expanded, and it is possible to conduct planned propaganda to all passengers taking the train every day according to the needs of the country and the masses. As long as the content is fresh and the form is lively, passengers will welcome it. Train propaganda also has a very important effect: it has cultivated a group of outstanding propagandists. Propagandists find all possible time on the train or in the dormitory to discuss issues and compile propaganda materials, which strengthens the cultural and political study of workers and staff on the train and improves their spirit of serving the people. The work of train propaganda is a practical political education for train staff themselves. Now they are very enthusiastic about train propaganda and consider it a glorious political task.
　　In the past ten months, the main problems encountered in the train propaganda of the Tianjin Railway Bureau and the experience in solving them are: (1) Universal education must be carried out among the staff. Although train propaganda is automatically and consciously done by active members of the workers, when it is promoted among all staff, it still encounters many ideological resistances. Some people think it is "meddling" and propose to stop it, and some staff care about face and are afraid of making mistakes in front of passengers from all walks of life. After clarifying the importance of train propaganda, especially after personally visiting and seeing the actual effect, this problem was solved. (2) Train propaganda materials must be supplied in a timely and multifaceted manner. The content should be multifaceted, and the forms should also be many (one content needs to have various forms such as clapper talk, rhyming verse, explanation, etc., so that propagandists with various skills can adopt them at the same time). The compilation of propagandists is active, but attention must be paid to review, because train propaganda speaks to the people of the whole country, and a serious and responsible attitude should be adopted. Some party organizations in Tianjin Railway have made mistakes due to insufficient review. In addition, leading organs should regularly provide some propaganda materials. Now the leading organs provide very little, mainly relying on the train propaganda group to write it themselves, which is of course one of the methods of training propagandists, but the guidance and help of the leading organs are necessary. (3) The Party and the trade union must attach importance to the train propaganda work and establish a party propaganda network in the train propaganda work. The Party's leadership over train propaganda was very weak at first. Not only did it not regularly provide propaganda materials, but it also did not provide timely and in-depth assistance and education to the train propaganda group. The Propaganda Department of the Political Department and the propaganda sections of the three sub-bureaus mainly promoted the experience of advanced propaganda groups in the two propaganda conferences and in propaganda manuals and newspapers, and sent cadres to follow the trains to understand the activities of train propaganda. Now the Party organization has attached importance to this work ideologically, established propagandist training classes, and actively cultivated train propagandists.
　　The influence of train propaganda is already very large. It faces all levels and reaches all directions. In the past six months, it has left a good impression on the broad masses of passengers. About 150 million people took the train on the national railway in the past year. If train propaganda is established throughout the national railway, the people's railway transportation network can form a large propaganda network for the people of the whole country.
　　Therefore, this work should be promoted throughout the country. Not only can propaganda work be carried out on trains across the country, but also on ships, long-distance buses, and other similar public places. Facts have proven: the broad masses of passengers need it, the people's railway needs it, and the propaganda cause also needs it. On the people's train, train propaganda can be fully launched.

　　列车宣传
    陈春森
    去年夏天，在天津铁路局的列车上，开始了一种对广大旅客群众的新的宣传工作——列车宣传。到目前为止，全路局的列车包乘组中已经建立了五十七个列车宣传组（其中有两个妇女组），有三百多职工参加。从北京、天津、张家口、大同、归绥等地出发的列车上，几乎全部都有了列车宣传工作。十个月来，已经向四百多万旅客进行了宣传。宣传的内容包括时事、政策和铁路常识等。现在全国列车宣传的线路已经伸展到华北、华东、中南、西北、东北的许多大小城镇，它的影响实际已经扩展到铁路沿线的许多乡村。
    列车宣传，是列车乘务人员们共同进行的，由列车员、客运车长和公安员、检车工联合组成列车宣传组，“联合劳动”。天津铁路局最先做列车宣传的，是大同地区陈庚申、赵英才的包乘组，他们从一九五○年六月起就开始了这项工作，当时只是由于列车安全与旅客安全的需要，画了些坐火车不留心，跌伤摔死的实事画片，向旅客（主要是农民旅客）讲解坐火车的常识，避免或减少事故。在和平签名及抗美援朝运动中，铁道部政治部宣传部召开宣传会议，向全路推广他们的经验，各列车宣传组更充实了时事宣传的内容，又创造了许多通俗活泼的宣传形式，使列车宣传逐渐形成一种为广大旅客欢迎的宣传活动。
    列车宣传，是和整个铁路的宣传以及全国的宣传协同进行的，内容很丰富。列车宣传组天天向成千成万的旅客报告当天报纸的要闻，介绍人民日报的社论，他们愿意使每一个坐火车的人都能知道我们的国家和世界上每天在发生着什么重大变化，并特别注意为不识字的农民旅客去讲解这些问题。去年和平签名运动时，列车上反复进行和平签名的宣传，在京绥、京汉、京沪线上七天之内，曾有六万多旅客在列车上签名反对使用原子武器。抗美援朝保家卫国运动开始以来，四十七个列车宣传组普遍展开了这方面的宣传活动，他们讲过和唱过许多朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军英勇抗美的事迹，宣传为什么抗美必须援朝，宣传美帝国主义完全可以被打败，宣传中国人民应以什么行动抗美援朝。他们采用各种形式宣传反对美帝国主义武装日本。在京长列车上，有一位六十七岁的老农民田养坪，听了列车员的宣传以后，在车厢里激愤地控诉了日本法西斯在阳泉残杀中国百姓的罪行，最后号召车内旅客坚决支持抗美援朝的正义战争说：“年青的可以上前线，我虽老了，还可以抬担架，我们这正义的战争一定能够打胜！”旁的旅客，随即起立带领全车群众，高喊抗美援朝口号。京沪列车上青年包乘组在临城宣传后，上海烟草公司会计师杜先生当场捐出六十万元，叫列车员代转朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队。
    列车宣传组经常宣传中央人民政府的政策法令，如土地法、婚姻法、惩治反革命条例、取缔反动道门会门的命令、铁路运价政策等。在京绥线上，这方面的宣传是配合地方工作进行的，并且针对京绥沿线农民群众中的婚姻问题、反动谣言及其他问题，用山西、察哈尔、绥远的方言去宣传，收效很好。他们用很大力量讲解了坐火车的常识，减少了许多列车事故。此外，还演唱了一些民间故事和抗美援朝的英雄事迹。在携带小孩的车厢里，他们向妇女旅客讲解妇婴卫生常识。
    列车宣传的形式很多，通俗有韵的快板之类最受欢迎。列车宣传组都在积极钻研和创作。他们满腔热情，自编自演。唱快板、说相声、讲图片、奏单弦、唱小放牛、说大鼓书、读报、唱歌，应有尽有。宣传员们有时扮演“三才”，来揭露一贯道罪行；有时组织“列车晚会”，表演话剧（如吸收旅客中的文化艺术工作者、军人、干部、学生参加表演《王秀鸾》《平汉路小调》等）。列车上的广播器，在这些活动中受到充分的利用。
    农民们坐火车，对列车宣传特别感兴趣。在京绥、京山、京汉、津浦等线上，针对农民旅客的爱好，多采用快板、对口唱、相声等形式，农民很喜欢。他们听了，众口称好，说“坐了火车、听了玩艺儿，也懂了国家大事。毛主席领导下的人民铁路就是好。”在京绥列车上宣传土地改革政策与揭露一贯道罪行时，一个应该在康庄下车的旅客不下车，他说“听完这段再走”。京山线上一个到芦台站应该下车的旅客，他为了继续听列车员的宣传，也要求补票听到唐山。雁北出席省劳动英雄模范工作者大会的全体农民代表写信给列车包乘组，说“我们这些庄户人坐上专车，你们还把国家大事、坐火车的规矩和一贯道的坏事告诉我们，使我们懂得了许多事。我们大家觉得这样办很好，并望能发扬这种宣传，帮助我们庄户人多得知识。”
    在列车上，也为旅客准备了许多书刊、杂志、画报和报纸，列车员细心地为群众报告新闻，介绍时事手册。列车宣传组义务地推销书报，因为这是在人民群众中散播文化食粮，是列车宣传的一种好方法。旅客买书报的很多。据不完全的统计，去年年底以前北京的包乘组即卖出时事手册一万余册，活页时事资料销售也很多。从北京到长安，一趟车可以销出四百多份人民日报。
    和列车宣传相配合，车站上的宣传活动，也已经在北京、天津、丰台、张家口、大同、归绥、唐山、保定等大站开始。朝鲜战局图、时事漫画、大字报和口头宣传，是车站宣传的主要形式。
    列车宣传已经获得初步良好的效果。它帮助群众贯彻中央人民政府的政策法令，积极推动抗美援朝运动，使千千万万的乘客在旅途中也过着多种多样的政治生活和文化生活。它密切了人民群众和铁路的关系。老百姓说：“过去坐反动派的火车，真是提心吊胆；现在坐人民火车，好像在家里一样畅快。”有人称现在的人民列车“好像一座学校”。列车宣传对于铁路和旅客的安全起了很大作用。开展列车宣传以来，旅客死伤事故大为减少。有了列车宣传，扩大了对人民群众进行时事宣传的阵地，每天可以根据国家和群众的需要，向所有坐火车的旅客有计划的宣传，只要内容新鲜，形式活泼，旅客都是欢迎的。列车宣传还有一个很重要的效果：它培养了一批优秀的宣传工作者。宣传员们在车上或宿舍里，找一切可能的时间讨论问题，编写宣传资料，使列车上的工人职员的文化政治学习加强了，为人民服务的精神提高了。列车宣传的工作，对于列车职工自己就是一种实际的政治教育。现在他们搞列车宣传的热情非常高，认为这是一个光荣的政治任务。
    十个月来，就天津铁路局列车宣传中所碰到的问题和解决的经验来说，主要有三条：（一）必须在职工中作普遍的教育。列车宣传虽是由工人中的积极分子自动自觉地做起来的，但在全体职工中推广时，仍然遇到过许多思想上的抵抗，有的认为是“多事”，提出要停止，有些职工爱面子，面对各方面的旅客，怕讲错等等。在讲明了列车宣传的重要，尤其是亲自参观并看到实效以后，这个问题才解决了。（二）必须及时而多方面地供给列车宣传资料。内容要多方面，形式也要多（一种内容就需要有快板、数来宝、讲解等多种形式，各样本领的宣传员才可以同时采用）。宣传员的编写是积极的，但必须注意审查，因为列车宣传是对全国人民说话，应该采取严肃负责的态度。天津铁路有些党的组织曾因审查不周，出过错误。此外，领导机关应当经常供给一部分宣传资料。现在领导机关供给的很少，主要靠列车宣传组自己编写，这当然是培养宣传员的方法之一，但领导机关的指导帮助是必要的。（三）党和工会必须重视列车宣传工作，并在列车宣传工作中建立党的宣传网。党对列车宣传的领导，起初是很薄弱的，不仅没有经常供给宣传资料，而且对列车宣传组也未及时进行深入的帮助和教育。政治部宣传部和三个分局宣传科对列车宣传的领导，主要是在两次宣传会议中和宣传手册、报纸上推广先进宣传组的经验，派干部随列车了解列车宣传的活动。现在党的组织已在思想上重视这个工作，设立了宣传员训练班，积极培养列车宣传员。
    列车宣传的影响已经很大了。它面向各个阶层，传到四面八方。半年来已经在广大旅客群众中留下良好的印象。全国铁路在去年一年内约有一亿五千万人坐火车，如果全国铁路都建立列车宣传，人民的铁路交通网就可以形成一个对全国人民群众的大宣传网。
    因此，这项工作，应该推广到全国去。不但在全国的火车中可以进行宣传工作，而且在轮船、长途汽车和其他类似的公共场所，都可以也应当进行宣传工作。事实已经证明：广大旅客需要它，人民铁路需要它，宣传事业也需要它。在人民的列车上，列车宣传是完全可以展开的。
