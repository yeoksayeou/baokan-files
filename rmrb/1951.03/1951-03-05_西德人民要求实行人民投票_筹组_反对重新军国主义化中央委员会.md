Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd dispatch: A TASS dispatch reports: The anti-remilitarization committees established by people from all walks of life in West Germany to take unified action are now negotiating to establish a "Central Committee Against Remilitarization" in order to centrally lead the people in the American, British, and French occupation zones in their struggle against the American rearmament of West Germany. To this end, the central preparatory committee established for this purpose met in Düsseldorf on February 25 to discuss measures to hold a referendum throughout the country on the issue of West German remilitarization. Representatives from local committees in Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Mannheim, Hanover, Kassel, Wiesbaden, Kiel, Hamburg, Bremen, Kronach, Düsseldorf, Singen, and Freiburg attended the meeting. They enthusiastically hailed the World Peace Council's resolution on assisting the people of all countries in their protest movement against the remilitarization of West Germany, and reported on the work of committees in the West German states and the establishment of new committees in Hesse, Bremen, Bavaria, and other states and cities.

Currently, the struggle of the West German people is focused on holding a referendum on the issue of West German rearmament. Recently, a protest rally of more than a thousand people was held in Munich, demanding a referendum. A declaration was distributed at the meeting, which read: "I declare that I am against and will always be against the remilitarization of Germany, because I believe that it will lead to the destruction of our entire nation. Remilitarization must be a matter resolved by a referendum." Many people signed the declaration on the spot.

　　西德人民要求实行人民投票
    筹组“反对重新军国主义化中央委员会”
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社消息：西德各界人民为统一行动而纷纷在各地成立的反对重新军国主义化委员会，现正协议筹备成立“反对重新军国主义化中央委员会”，以集中领导整个美、英、法占领区人民进行反对美国武装西德的斗争。为此而成立的中央筹备委员会，已于二月二十五日在杜塞尔多夫开会，讨论了采取措施在全国就西德重新军国主义化问题举行人民投票的问题。参加会议的有慕尼黑、纽伦堡、奥格斯堡、曼海姆、汉诺威、卡塞尔、威斯巴登、基尔、汉堡、不来梅、克罗那赫、杜塞尔多夫、辛根、夫赖堡各地方委员会的代表。他们热烈地欢呼世界和平理事会关于援助各国人民反对西德重新军国主义化的抗议运动的决议，并就西德各州的委员会的工作以及黑森、不来梅、巴伐利亚及其他各州各城建立新委员会的问题提出了报告。
    目前西德人民的斗争集中在就西德重新武装的问题举行人民投票上。最近，在慕尼黑举行了一千多人的抗议大会，要求实行人民投票。会上散发一项宣言，上面写着：“我声明，我反对而且必将始终反对德国重新军国主义化，因为我认为，那会使我们全体国民遭到毁灭。重新军国主义化必须成为由人民投票来解决的问题。”许多人当场就在这个宣言上签了名。
