Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement denouncing MacArthur's arrogant clamor of the 24th. The statement said:

　　On March 24th, MacArthur, the chief culprit in the invasion of Korea, issued a shameless statement. He attempted to incite the American and British invaders to expand the war of aggression to China. This statement once again exposed the aggressive face of American imperialism and once again proved that the American aggressors are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people. We, the Chinese working class, express limitless indignation at this shameless, arrogant statement that insults our great motherland.

　　The Chinese working class fully understands that MacArthur's arrogant statement cannot express the strength and power of the American aggressors in the slightest; on the contrary, it precisely indicates the dead end of the American aggressors. With the strong support of the Chinese and Korean people, the Chinese and Korean People's Army has achieved great victories on the Korean battlefield. Although it may take a long and fierce battle on the Korean battlefield, there is no doubt that after annihilating a large number of enemy effectives, final victory belongs to the Chinese and Korean people. We have full confidence and assurance.

　　MacArthur attempts to scare us with shameless bluster, but the Chinese people, who have already stood up, will never be intimidated. MacArthur attempts to deceive us with sweet talk and traps, but similarly, the Chinese people, who have rich experience in fighting aggressors, will not be deceived. MacArthur's arrogant statement can only have one result, and that is to further arouse the hatred of the entire Chinese people for American imperialism and to strengthen their determination to resist aggression.

　　We, the Chinese working class, fully agree with the statement and call of the spokesperson of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and are determined to defend our great motherland with our own practical actions. We will, together with the people of the whole country, raise our vigilance a thousandfold and be ready at all times to strike at the aggressors who dare to invade our motherland. We will, together with the people of the whole country, carry out the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country more widely and deeply, and drive the American aggressors out of Korea and Taiwan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: A spokesperson for the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League issued a statement denouncing MacArthur's challenging bluster, saying:

　　MacArthur, the chief culprit in the invasion of Korea, issued an extremely shameless and arrogant statement on March 24th, openly attempting to expand the war of aggression in Korea to the territory of our motherland. Obviously, this arrogant boasting will soon meet with a shameful failure, just like his many past wild remarks! However, we must pay close attention to this conspiracy to expand aggression. We want to warn this American rogue and war criminal: We, the youth of China, together with the people, are not afraid of any intimidation and will never tolerate any insult to our motherland. The youth and members of the Youth League throughout the country are determined to raise their vigilance, strengthen the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, and resolutely fight for the complete elimination of American imperialism's aggressive forces in China and Korea. We fully believe that this sacred struggle will surely be victorious.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The spokesperson of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement on MacArthur's arrogant statement of March 24th as follows: MacArthur's shameless bluster is a complete slander and provocation against the Chinese people, and once again exposes the sinister face of American imperialism's deliberate aggression against our country. The Chinese people and Chinese women have already won unprecedented and great victories in the long struggle against imperialist aggression, and will never be intimidated by this kind of bluster. On the contrary, we must strengthen our work to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country until we finally defeat the American aggressors and help the Korean people liberate all of Korea.

　　全国总工会、青年团中央、全国民主妇联
    对麦克阿瑟狂言表示无限愤怒
    决心加强开展抗美援朝运动
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华全国总工会发表声明，痛斥麦克阿瑟二十四日的狂妄叫嚣。声明说：
    三月二十四日，侵略朝鲜的罪魁麦克阿瑟发表了一个无耻的声明。他企图煽动美英侵略者把侵略战争扩大到中国。这个声明，再一次地暴露了美帝国主义的侵略面孔，再一次地证明了美国侵略者是中国人民的死敌。我们中国工人阶级，对这个无耻的、狂妄的、侮辱我们伟大祖国的声明，表示无限的愤怒。
    中国工人阶级十分懂得：麦克阿瑟这个狂妄的声明，丝毫不能够表示美国侵略者的强大和有力；相反，却正是表示着美国侵略者的穷途末路。在中朝人民的有力支持下，中朝人民军队已在朝鲜战场上取得了伟大的胜利。尽管在朝鲜战场上还可能要经过长期的、剧烈的战斗，但是，毫无疑问，在大量地歼灭敌人的有生力量以后，最后胜利是属于中朝人民的。我们有十分的把握，有充分的信心。
    麦克阿瑟企图用无耻的狂言吓唬我们，但是，已经站起来了的中国人民是决不会被吓倒的。麦克阿瑟企图用花言巧语的圈套来欺骗我们，但是，同样地，有着丰富的向侵略者进行斗争的经验的中国人民是不会受骗的。麦克阿瑟的狂妄声明只能得到一个结果，那就是，更加激起全中国人民对美帝国主义的仇恨和坚定他们反抗侵略的决心。
    我们中国工人阶级，完全同意中国人民抗美援朝总会发言人的谈话和号召，并决心用自己的实际行动来保卫我们伟大的祖国。我们要和全国人民一道，千百倍地提高警惕，时时刻刻准备打击敢于侵犯我们祖国的侵略者。我们要和全国人民一道，更广泛更深入地开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动，把美国侵略者从朝鲜、台湾赶出去。
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会发言人发表痛斥麦克阿瑟的挑战狂言的声明说：
    侵略朝鲜的罪魁麦克阿瑟三月二十四日发表了一个极端无耻的、狂妄的声明，公然企图把侵略朝鲜战争扩大到我们祖国的疆土上来。很显然，这一狂妄的吹牛不久必然像他过去许多次的妄言一样，遭到可耻的失败！但是，我们必须密切地注意这一扩大侵略的阴谋。我们要警告这个美国流氓和战争罪犯：我们全中国的青年和人民一道，决不怕任何恐吓，而且也决不容忍对我们祖国的任何侮辱。全国青年和青年团员决心与全国人民一道，提高警惕，加强开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动，坚决为彻底消灭美国帝国主义在中国和朝鲜的侵略势力而斗争。我们充分相信这一神圣的斗争必然获得胜利。
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会发言人就麦克阿瑟三月二十四日的狂妄声明发表谈话如下：麦克阿瑟的这种无耻狂言，完全是对中国人民污蔑和挑衅，再一次暴露了美帝国主义蓄意侵略我国的凶恶面目。中国人民和中国妇女已经在长期反对帝国主义侵略斗争中获得了空前伟大的胜利，决不会被这种狂言所吓倒。相反的，我们一定要加强抗美援朝保家卫国的工作，直到最后战胜美国侵略者，帮助朝鲜人民解放全朝鲜为止。
