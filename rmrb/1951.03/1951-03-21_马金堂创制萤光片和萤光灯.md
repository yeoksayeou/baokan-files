    Ma Jintang Creates Fluorescent Screens and Fluorescent Lamps

    To the Editor:
    Ma Jintang, a model worker of the first rank and chief physician of the X-ray department at Wuhan Municipal Second Hospital, has created improved fluorescent screens and fluorescent observation lamps. This is a highly valuable new contribution to medical supplies in our country. In the past, the X-ray films used in our country were always purchased from foreign countries, and the prices were very expensive. It is estimated that the improved fluorescent small films created by Comrade Ma Jintang can save the country more than 500 million yuan in RMB annually.

    Taking photographs using the improved fluorescent small films requires very simple equipment, and the cost is only 5,000 yuan per sheet (large X-ray films purchased from foreign countries cost about 80,000 yuan per sheet); and the work efficiency has also been increased threefold.

    When Ma Jintang first started experimenting, he found that tuberculosis bacteria appeared on the fluorescent small film only as some faint shadows. He further created the fluorescent lamp, and by using the fluorescent lamp to observe, the shadows of tuberculosis bacteria appearing on the fluorescent small film became very clear. The production of fluorescent lamps is also very easy, and their use is very convenient.

    马金堂创制萤光片和萤光灯编辑同志：
    武汉市立第二医院甲等劳动模范、Ｘ光科主任医师马金堂创制了萤光改良片和萤光观察灯。对我国医疗用品上是一个极有价值的新贡献。过去我国所用Ｘ光片一向购自外国，价格非常昂贵。据估计，马金堂同志创制的萤光改良小片每年可替国家节约人民币五亿多元。
    用萤光改良小片照相，所需器材很简单，成本每张只要五千元（购自外国的大型Ｘ光片每张需八万元左右）；并且工作效率也提高了三倍。
    马金堂最初试验时，发现结核菌显现在萤光小片上，还只是一些残淡的阴影。他又进一步创制了萤光灯，用萤光灯来观察，结核菌显现在萤光小片上的阴影就十分清楚了。萤光灯的制作也很容易，使也用很方便。
