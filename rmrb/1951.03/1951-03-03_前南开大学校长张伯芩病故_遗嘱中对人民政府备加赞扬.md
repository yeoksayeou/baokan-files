Xinhua News Agency report:

　　Former Nankai University President Zhang Boqin died of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 23rd at the age of 76. Zhang founded Tianjin Nankai University, Tianjin Nankai Middle School, and Chongqing Nankai Middle School, making contributions to education. However, politically he placed his hopes on the reactionary ruling class, and in his later years even served as the President of the Examination Yuan of the Kuomintang reactionary government. After the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and Chiang Kai-shek's flight to Taiwan, Zhang began to regret his past mistakes, so he remained in Chongqing and returned to Tianjin in the summer of 1950. Before his death, Zhang left a will, encouraging Nankai students to support the People's Government. The will stated: "Today's People's Government is the most honest and excellent government China has ever had. Its policies of developing production and befriending the Soviet Union are truly far-sighted, wise, and correct. All my friendly classmates should do their best, unite together, work for the public and the country, and support the People's Government to build a prosperous, strong, and happy new China. With infinite bright prospects, I will await them with a smile."

　　前南开大学校长张伯芩病故
    遗嘱中对人民政府备加赞扬
    【新华社讯】前南开大学校长张伯芩二月二十三日因脑出血病故，年七十六岁。张曾创办天津南开大学、天津南开中学、重庆南开中学，对教育事业有所贡献。但在政治上则寄希望于反动统治阶级，晚年竟任国民党反动政府考试院院长。在中国人民解放战争胜利，蒋匪逃亡台湾后，张对过去错误开始悔悟，故留居重庆，并于一九五○年夏返至天津。张病故前留下遗嘱，勉南开学生拥护人民政府。遗嘱称：“今日之人民政府，为中国前所未有之廉洁良好政府，其发展生产、友好苏联之政策，实为高瞻远瞩，英明正确之政策。凡我友好同学，允宜竭尽所能，合群团结，为公为国，拥护人民政府，以建设富强康乐之新中国。无限光明远景，余将含笑待之。”
