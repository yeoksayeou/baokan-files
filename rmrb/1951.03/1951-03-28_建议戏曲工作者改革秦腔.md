Letter to the Editor Excerpts

　　Suggesting Opera Workers Reform Qin腔 Editor:
    There is a Qin腔 opera troupe in Tianqiao, Beijing, that has very good acting skills. They perform at the "Dan Gui Theatre" every day, and there is a large audience. Because rural vendors and some of the working-class citizens of the capital like this sonorous and simple local opera, its publicity influence cannot be ignored. Their stage style is also relatively simple, and their singing is very diligent, but most of the content of the plays promotes feudal ideas and outdated things, such as "Qin Xuemei Mourns" and "Da Bao Guo Er Jin Gong." This content is very harmful to the working people. I suggest that Beijing's opera workers, in the work of reforming old opera and folk art, should not only focus on the reform of pilot projects (such as Peking Opera and crosstalk), but also pay attention to helping the reform of Qin腔. New scripts with progressive ideas, such as "Blood and Tears of Hatred" and "The Poor Man's Hate," should be written and performed to enable artists to better serve the working people.

### 建议戏曲工作者改革秦腔

专栏：来信摘要

　　建议戏曲工作者改革秦腔编辑同志：
    北京天桥有一个演技很不错的秦腔剧团，每天在“丹桂戏园”演唱，上座很多。因为农村商贩和首都的一部分劳动市民，很喜欢这种高亢朴素的地方戏，所以他的宣传影响是不可忽视的。他们的舞台作风也比较朴素，演唱也很努力，但是戏的内容大部是宣传封建思想和陈旧不堪的东西，如：“秦雪梅吊孝”、“大保国二进宫”等。这些内容对劳动人民是非常有害的。我建议北京的戏曲工作者们在旧曲艺的改革工作中，不要只偏重试点（如平剧、相声）的改革，也要注意帮助秦腔的改革工作。应编演像“血泪仇”、“穷人恨”等有进步思想的新剧本，使艺人们更好地为劳动人民服务。
                                                郑重
