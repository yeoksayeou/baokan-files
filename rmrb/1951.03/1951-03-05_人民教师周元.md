　　People's Teacher Zhou Yuan
　　Li Yang Li Zhongqing
　　　　　　(1) Arrival at Nan Village
　　Liukou River is a small village at the foot of the South Mountain in Yuxian County, Chahar Province. During the Kuomintang rule, the Yang family in the south of the village and the Li family in the north of the village were at odds with each other due to unnecessary entanglements, so they divided Liukou River into two halves with a small river in the village: the north side was called Beibao, and the south side was called Nan Village. But the two villages only had one school, and the teachers had to teach in turns, this year in Nan Village and next year in Beibao.
　　After the local liberation in 1948, the hatred between the two families was gradually eliminated through the mediation of the People's Government. In the winter of the same year, the county sent Tian Yuhong to Beibao to be a teacher; and Zhou Yuan was sent to Nan Village.
　　When Zhou Yuan walked into the school, it was truly desolate. The school building was a few broken houses, with missing doors and windows, the roof was leaking, the ground was full of messy weeds, and the walls were covered with black and yellow horse manure. He thought to himself: "The village is so poor, the school is so bad, I'm afraid it can't be done!" The village cadres also thought, "The teacher is from the city, I'm afraid he can't bear this kind of hardship!"
　　Xu Man, the village's cultural and educational committee member, mobilized a few people to clean the house, nailed the windows with cut-off telephone poles, and pasted paper on them; and carried the offering table in the temple in to use as a table. The school finally started.
　　　　　　(2) Being a People's Teacher
　　The cultural level of the villagers was very low. Only a dozen people could write simple accounts, and only a few young people could read a few words. Originally, there was a school in the village before the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the Japanese invaders occupied Jiugongkou nearby, due to the harassment of the enemy and the rampant behavior of landlords and traitors, the young people joined the guerrillas, and the school collapsed. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang reactionaries and bandits came to attack the liberated people and occupied the village, turning the school into a stable.
　　In 1948, the People's Liberation Army launched a major counter-offensive, and Liukou River was liberated again. After the land reform, the liberated peasants eagerly demanded to learn culture. They had great expectations for this people's teacher.
　　How could Comrade Zhou Yuan fail to live up to the expectations of the villagers? He was determined to run the school well. He led the older students to plaster the walls of the classroom and build mud tables with adobe bricks; if there were not enough benches, he mobilized the students to bring their own.
　　School started, but everyone didn't have textbooks. What to do? He had to write the words on the blackboard and teach the students to recognize them.
　　Several older children in the class made faster progress, so they were assigned to the third grade. When teaching Chinese, he only required "two competencies" (being able to speak and write); for written calculations, he first taught simple ones; for abacus, he first learned how to calculate land area.
　　When the villagers saw that their children were progressing so fast and could use the abacus to calculate land area, they were all happy.
　　Comrade Zhou Yuan also understood the students' family situation, the parents' requirements, and the children's ability to accept at any time, and then carried out individual education. He gave help to children from particularly poor families, such as giving them textbooks or slate pencils; sometimes he even gave some of his millet to the students. When students were sick, he personally went to visit them. If he was too busy with his work to go, he would ask other children to bring a note to express his condolences. Under his influence, close friendships were established between the students. Whenever it rained heavily, the older students would carry the younger students home on their backs.
　　In the propaganda campaign to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country, Comrade Zhou Yuan linked the atrocities of US imperialism in Korea with the past atrocities of Japanese invaders in the village, such as killing, arson, rape and looting, to arouse the students' love for the motherland and hatred for US imperialism.
　　Under his efforts in teaching, fifty-eight students (accounting for ninety-four percent of the school-age children in the village) persisted in learning.
　　　　　　(3) Caring for the Life of the Masses
　　Comrade Zhou Yuan not only enthusiastically taught, but also actively participated in all mass activities. This enabled him to establish close ties with all the villagers. He led everyone to organize a reading group and establish a blackboard newspaper; helping everyone understand national affairs. In the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the villagers paid public grain early.
　　He also actively participated in disaster relief work. The summer before last, mountain floods destroyed the slopes, and the autumn harvest was reduced by half compared to previous years. Many students could only drink two thin bowls of porridge a day. In this way, the older children had to go to school for half a day and cut firewood and weave baskets at home for sideline occupations for the other half. Comrade Zhou Yuan led the students to participate in disaster relief and famine relief work. Every afternoon, he divided all the students into three digging vegetable groups to pick wild vegetables. During the summer hoeing, he organized the students to help families lacking labor to weed. Twenty-four students earned four hundred and eighty kilograms of millet in half a month. This solved the students' living problems and maintained afternoon and evening classes.
　　He was also very concerned about the winter school. The winter before last, the county called for the establishment of winter schools, and he helped teach. However, sometimes the attendance rate of the students was very low, so he consulted with the village's cultural and educational committee member and formulated certain study times and subjects (politics, current affairs, literacy, arithmetic, production, etc.) according to the busy farming season. The winter school finally got going. When awarding prizes, he received the "Winter School Model" award.
　　　　　　(4) Loved by All the Villagers
　　Due to Comrade Zhou Yuan's hard work in teaching and his concern for the lives of the masses, all the villagers developed a close feeling for him. They regarded him as their own relatives and friends. When Comrade Zhou Yuan didn't have time to collect his salary of rice, the students' parents took turns sending the rice back with donkeys. Some parents sent him firewood; some children also sent him cabbage, radish, yam, and pickles from their homes.
　　All the villagers love this people's teacher. Whenever there are New Year's or festivals, everyone always invites the teacher to eat. When the village cadres come back from meetings in the district and arrange important matters, they often ask him to help; when the village writes reports and creates forms to the superiors, and when the old ladies write letters to their sons in the army, they all ask him to write for them. In order to solve the teacher's livelihood problems, everyone cultivated four mu of land for him. During the autumn harvest last year, two mu of sorghum yielded six dou, and two mu of yam yielded six sacks.

　　人民教师周元
    李扬　李钟庆
            （一）到了南村
    柳河口是察哈尔省蔚县南山脚下的一个小村子。在国民党统治时期，村南的杨姓大户和村北的李姓大户，因为无谓的纠葛，弄得水火不相容，便以村中的一道小河把柳河口分成了两半：北边的叫北堡，南边的叫南村。但是两村只有一个学校，教员只好轮流着教，今年在南村，明年到北堡。
    一九四八年当地解放以后，经过人民政府的调解，两姓之间的仇恨算是逐渐消除了。同年的冬天，县里派田玉鸿到北堡去当教员；而周元则被派到南村。
    周元一走进学校，真是满眼荒凉。校舍是几间破房子，又是少门没户的，屋顶露了天，地上堆满了杂乱的野草，墙上黑一块黄一块地粘满了马粪。他心里想：“村子这么穷，学校这样糟，恐怕搞不起来吧！”村干部也认为“先生是城里人，怕吃不了这种苦吧！”
    村文教委员徐满发动了几个人，把房子打扫干净，用截断了的电线杆子把窗户钉上，糊上了纸；把庙里的供桌抬进去当桌子。学校终于开学了。
            （二）做一个人民教师
    全村老百姓的文化程度非常低，能写简单账目的只有十几个人，而识几个字的青年，也寥寥无几。原来，在抗战前村里有一所学校，日本强盗占领附近的九宫口以后，由于敌人的骚扰和地主汉奸的横行，青年人都参加了游击队，学校就垮台了。而在日寇投降以后，国民党反动派匪军又来进攻解放区人民，侵占了该村，把学校变成了马圈。
    一九四八年解放军大反攻，柳河口重获解放。土地改革以后，翻身农民迫切要求学习文化。他们对于这个人民教师怀着满腔的热望。
    周元同志怎能辜负全村人民的期望呢？他下决心要把学校办好。他带领年纪大一些的同学，抹好了教室的墙壁，用土坯砌成泥桌子；凳子不够用，就动员学生自己带来。
    学校开学了，但大家都没有课本。怎么办呢？就只好把字写在黑板上教同学认。
    班里几个年龄较大的孩子进步较快，便把他们编为三年级。教国语时只要求两会（会说会写）；笔算则先教简单的；珠算先学算地亩。
    老乡们见到自己的子女进步这样快，能用珠算计算地亩了，都觉得高兴。
    周元同志并随时随地了解学生的家庭情况、家长们的要求、儿童们的接受能力，然后进行个别教育。对于个别家庭特别穷苦的孩子，他给予了帮助，如送给课本或石笔；有时还把自己的小米匀出一部分送给学生。遇到学生有病时，他就亲自去访问。如功课太忙不能去的时候，就托别的孩子捎个条子去慰问。在他的影响下，同学之间建立了亲密的友情。每逢下大雨时，年龄较大的同学就把小同学背着送回家去。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传运动中，周元同志联系美帝国主义在朝鲜的兽行，把过去日本强盗在村中杀人放火、奸淫掳掠的暴行讲给孩子们听，以激发同学们热爱祖国、仇视美帝国主义的心理。
    在他努力教学下，五十八个同学（占全村学龄儿童的百分之九十四）始终坚持学习。
            （三）关心群众的生活
    周元同志不仅热心教学，还积极参加了一切群众活动。这样就使他和全村群众取得了密切联系。他领导大家组织了读报组，建立了黑板报；帮助大家了解国家大事。在抗美援朝运动中，全村老百姓纷纷提早缴纳公粮。
    他又积极参加了救灾工作。前年夏天，山洪把坡地都冲坏了，秋收比往年减了一半。许多学生一天只能喝两顿稀糊糊。这样，年纪大一点的孩子只好半天到校念书，半天在家打柴、编筐搞副业。周元同志便领导同学们参加了救灾度荒工作。每天下午，他把全校学生组成三个挖菜组，采摘野菜。夏锄时，他又组织同学帮助缺乏劳动力的人家锄草。二十四个同学在半个月中挣了四百八十斤小米。这样就解决了学生们的生活问题，并坚持了午课和晚课。
    他对冬学也很关心。前年冬天，县上号召办冬学，他就帮助教课。可是，有时学员的出席率很低，他便和村文教委员商量，根据农忙情况，规定了一定的学习时间和学习的科目（政治、时事、识字、算术、生产等课）。冬学终于搞起来了。评奖时，得到了“冬学模范”的奖励。
            （四）受到全村人民的热爱
    由于周元同志的刻苦教学、对群众生活的关心，全村老百姓对他产生了一种亲密的感情。他们把他当作自己的亲人、朋友。当周元同志没有时间去领薪米时，学生家长便轮流着用驴子把米给送回去。有些家长给他送去烧柴；有的孩子还把自己家里的白菜、萝卜、山药蛋、咸菜送给他。
    全村的老乡都热爱着这位人民教师。每逢过年过节，大家总是要把先生请去吃饭。村干部从区上开会回来，布置重要事情时，也常请他去帮助；村里向上级写报告、造表册，老大娘们给参军儿子写信，都找他代笔。为了解决教师的生活问题，大家给他代耕了四亩地。去年秋收时，二亩白高粱收了六斗，二亩山药蛋收了六口袋。
