Summary of Financial Work in 1950 and Guiding Principles and Tasks for Work in 1951
Rong Zihe, Vice Minister of Finance, Central People's Government

The financial work of 1950 was carried out under the direct leadership and strong support of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, adhering to the general policy of unifying national fiscal revenue and expenditure management, striving for a balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure, and stabilizing financial and commodity prices. Judging from the changes in the financial situation and the achievements of the work over the past year, we have basically implemented this policy. The main achievements of the financial work over the past year, some important experiences and lessons, as well as the guiding principles and tasks for the work in 1951, are briefly described below:

(I) Major Achievements

First, unified national fiscal revenue and expenditure management. After the financial conference in February of last year decided to unify the national financial and economic work, the central government then promulgated two decisions on "Unifying Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Management" and "Unifying the Revenue, Expenditure, Custody and Dispatch of National Public Grain." In terms of laws and regulations, the decisions on summer grain collection in 1950, provisional regulations on agricultural tax, industrial and commercial tax, goods tax, stamp tax, slaughter tax, interest income tax, and special consumption behavior tax in newly liberated areas were successively promulgated. In terms of systems, the treasury regulations and the 1950 national government budget plan and the supply standards for staff were promulgated. In addition, important regulations such as the measures for setting up financial inspection agencies, procedures for budget preparation and review, and various accounting systems were drafted and promulgated successively. Thanks to this series of measures, the resolute implementation by governments at all levels, and the support of the broad masses of the people, the national financial work has been unprecedentedly unified since March 1950.

In terms of laws and regulations: the vast majority of regions have uniformly implemented the central government's regulations, achieving national consistency and urban-rural material exchange, and gradually balancing the people's burdens. For example, since the establishment of the national tax revenue daily report, the national urban tax revenue, including industrial and commercial tax, goods tax and other taxes, can be reported every other day from 56 larger cities, and its figures account for about three-quarters of the total income of each item every day. The figures of customs duties and salt taxes reported every other day account for about nine-tenths of the total income of these two items every day. The income of other small cities, villages, and smaller customs posts and salt fields can also be reported in full every ten days. During the season of collecting public grain, we can roughly get the report of national collection and storage every ten days. Most of the national public grain collected in various places can be stored on time, so that we can understand the national income situation at any time.

In terms of revenue and expenditure management: except for the expenditure of township (village) and urban municipal construction surcharges and the expenses of rural village administration primary schools and urban primary schools and county simple normal schools, other expenditures, including the budgets of governments at all levels above the district level, field armies, local armed forces, public security forces, and institutions, schools, and organizations supplied or subsidized by the state, are managed by the central government, and can be drawn from the Ministry of Finance by the financial departments or logistics departments at all levels on a monthly or quarterly basis according to the prepared and allocated budget. In terms of cash management, we can not only understand the total income situation in a timely manner, but also issue checks and allocate funds every day according to the reports of tax revenue and treasury transfers. Due to such unified revenue and expenditure management, we can focus on the priorities and allocate expenditures according to the importance and urgency, so as to concentrate our efforts on supplying the army. In terms of food supply, we basically ensure that the food can be delivered wherever the army goes. In addition, we also take out 6 billion catties of public grain to the central trade department to regulate cities, and 1 billion catties of public grain (excluding cash) to relieve disasters and urban unemployed workers.

Looking at the financial situation of various regions in the past year, there are significant differences before and after the realization of unified management of fiscal revenue and expenditure. In the first quarter, the figures remitted by various regions to the central government accounted for 7.9% of the annual remittance, and the figures subsidized by the central government to various regions accounted for 43% of the annual subsidy. By the fourth quarter, the remittance reached 39.9%, and the subsidy dropped to 14.7%. Although there are various historical and work-related factors, the unified revenue and expenditure management is the main factor. It should be particularly pointed out that in the past year, the major administrative regions, provinces (cities), and departments have performed very well in implementing the unified financial control of revenue and expenditure. The vast majority of regions can appreciate the national financial difficulties and achieve more remittances and less expenditures. This is one of the important reasons for our financial work to achieve success.

Second, a situation of near balance between revenue and expenditure has emerged. The near balance between fiscal revenue and expenditure is a concentrated manifestation of the success of the financial work in 1950. According to the 1950 fiscal revenue and expenditure budget approved by the Central People's Government in December 1949:

On the revenue side, it exceeded the original budget by 31.7%. The issuance of public bonds was about 70.4% of the original budget. Looking at the situation of urban tax revenue: the income in the first quarter accounted for 16.5% of the annual income, the second quarter accounted for 21.6%, the third quarter accounted for 23.3%, and the fourth quarter accounted for 38.6%. The proportion of customs duties and salt taxes increasing quarter by quarter is roughly the same. The basic factor for the increase in tax revenue is certainly the favorable conditions brought about by price stability, material exchange, and economic recovery after the national financial and economic unification. However, our subjective efforts should be said to be the basic prerequisite for creating these conditions.

On the expenditure side, it exceeded by 14%. Looking at the cash expenditure situation in each quarter: the first quarter accounted for 21.4% of the annual expenditure, the second quarter accounted for 25.5%, the third quarter accounted for 24.4%, and the fourth quarter accounted for 28.7%. The largest increase in the above expenditures is in national defense and social undertakings, mainly due to disaster relief and unemployed workers, and support for the front lines. On the other hand, due to verifying the number of people, administrative expenses decreased, and the overall change is not large.

After deducting the above revenue and expenditure, the deficit accounted for 16.7% of the total actual expenditure, accounting for 96.6% of the original budget deficit. In addition to making up for the issuance of public bonds and Soviet loans, the bank overdraft was 13.1% less than the original budget. Furthermore, looking at the ratio of fiscal deficits in each quarter: the first quarter was 43%, the second quarter was 40% (including the use of public bond sales funds), the third quarter dropped to 9.8%, and the fourth quarter dropped further to 6.4%, indicating that our national fiscal revenue and expenditure are gradually trending towards balance, approaching balance. This is a great victory for us. However, the figures presented are only statistics based on the materials we have obtained, and there may be increases or decreases after the settlement of some revenue and expenditure, but the overall trend can be seen.

Third, the financial and commodity prices tend to be stable. Due to the near balance of our fiscal revenue and expenditure, the national financial and commodity prices have undergone significant changes. According to the statistics of the head office of the People's Bank of China, taking December 1949 as the base period, the weighted index of 32 major commodities in six major cities across the country in 1950 was: 121.2 in January, 177.3 in February, 210.9 in March, 173.4 in April, 154.6 in May, 163.7 in June, 178.2 in July, 182.6 in August, 185.2 in September, 192.77 in October, 201.7 in November, and 199.7 in December. The total index was 178.5. If we use the statistics of the Ministry of Trade, the total annual index of the same base period is only 177.4. From this, it can be seen that commodity prices in each month of the first quarter of 1950 rose sharply. Starting from April, they began to decline. After adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors in June, they turned stable. After July, although the prices of certain imported goods fluctuated slightly due to the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, the prices of people's necessities such as grain, cotton cloth, and fuel remained stable. From then on, the chaotic situation of long-term soaring prices and market instability left over by the Kuomintang for 13 years has basically disappeared. The reversal of this situation has provided extremely favorable conditions for our financial supply work. This cannot but be said to be a great fruit obtained after our fiscal revenue and expenditure balance.

The facts of the past year have proved that the Chinese people are fully capable of managing their own financial work very well without relying on the so-called "aid" of imperialism. The fallacy of some people that the People's Government "has no way to deal with financial and economic work" has been shattered by iron facts.

(II) Several Important Experiences and Lessons

Based on the above, our work achievements in 1950 are very great, but there are also many errors and shortcomings. The main reason is that when we implemented the February financial conference, we did not study and implement well Chairman Mao's instructions on the direction of all parties and Article 40 of the Common Program, which stipulates the simplification of the tax system and the implementation of a reasonable tax burden policy. We only one-sidedly emphasized the completion of tax revenue tasks, and neglected the adverse effects on the restoration and development of production and economic exchanges caused by the one-sided emphasis on tax revenue tasks. Therefore, within a certain period of time, we did not pay enough attention to the difficulties of some industrial and commercial circles and the coercive command style of some cadres, which led to certain deviations. In terms of laws and regulations, some of the tax laws and draft trial regulations we formulated were also improper, such as goods tax, stamp tax, special consumption behavior tax, real estate tax, and transaction tax all have problems, especially the provisions on tax categories, items, tax rates, and procedures in goods tax have great shortcomings. The salt tax rate was initially set too high, and the provisional regulations on agricultural tax in newly liberated areas were promulgated too late. At the same time, it is difficult for a single tax rate to suit the economic situation of the vast newly liberated areas. Some of the systems established were too demanding, and the regulations were not completely in line with the actual situation. At the same time, we did not apply the principles and flexibility of the policy strongly, and we did not grasp the key points, so we often made the mistake of "picking on small things" in our work. In terms of work style, we had bureaucratic and transactional problems, and often made mistakes due to procrastination and delays. Due to the existence of these facts, the experiences and lessons we have learned in the past year are very rich.

First, it has made us more deeply understand the path from economy to finance. "From economy to finance" is what Chairman Mao had already instructed, but in our actual work, we often deviated from this principle. In March and April of last year, we used a lot of effort to rush to collect taxes, but as a result, not only did everyone shout, but the task was not completed. After the measures of adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors and adjusting taxes in June, tax revenue gradually increased after September, and the income in the fourth quarter reached 38.6% of the annual tax revenue. This is certainly related to the peak and off seasons of tax revenue and the abundance of the year, but the government's measures to implement processing orders for private factories in cities and expand the purchase of local products in rural areas are the main reasons for increasing tax revenue. It shows that as long as the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas is realized, and industrial and agricultural production has a way out, the market economy will prosper, and tax revenue can be completed and exceeded. On the contrary, only emphasizing income, ignoring the cultivation of tax sources, and not paying much attention to the economic and production situation, this approach is wrong. Therefore, we need to set the tax rate appropriately. Exceeding or falling short will either damage the economy or affect finance. For example, after the second tax conference last year, the salt tax was reduced by half, which not only did not affect the completion of the task, but also promoted the transportation and sale of salt. Secondly, it is necessary to simplify the tax system. Complicated tax systems will打击[dǎ jī] strike; hit; attack production and restrict the exchange of materials. For example, after adjusting taxes last year, the number of goods tax items was reduced from 1138 to 358, of which 40 abolished the separate transportation procedures for goods and permits, and also abolished the modification and reinstallation procedures for various goods, and increased the amount of separate transportation; the stamp tax was reduced from 30 items to 25 items. As a result, not only was tax revenue not affected, but there were many benefits.

Second, levy according to the rate, solving the mistaken view of "contradiction between task and policy." In the past, our collection of agricultural tax and industrial and commercial tax was mostly carried out by distributing tasks according to the economic conditions of various places, so for many years, there has been the so-called "contradiction between task and policy," which has never been satisfactorily resolved. Around June last year, we proposed that all taxes, whether agricultural or industrial and commercial, should be levied according to the rate, but it was not certain at that time whether this would complete the task. After the result of implementing levying according to the rate in the autumn and winter of last year, the agricultural tax exceeded the collection by more than 1 billion catties, and the industrial and commercial tax in many areas also exceeded the estimated task. In this way, not only can cadres handle affairs in accordance with policies and regulations, complete the task, but also enable taxpayers to understand the amount of burden, gain the support of the broad masses of farmers and industrial and commercial circles, and solve a major problem in our tax work for many years.

Third, grasp the key points to control revenue and expenditure. The key point of income is mainly to pay attention to the peak season of income, the regions and cities with more income, as well as the main tax revenue and enterprise income. For example, the industrial and commercial goods tax in East China accounts for about 41.6% of the country, and the eight major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Wuhan, Shenyang, Beijing, and Chongqing account for nearly 50% of the country, of which Shanghai accounts for 23% and Tianjin accounts for 16%. In large cities, we should pay attention to large households. For example, in Shanghai, among 137,000 industrial and commercial households, the taxes of 4,000 large households account for 70% of the city, and in Tianjin, among 38,595 households, the taxes of 846 large households account for 56.5%. In the proportion of various taxes, agricultural tax accounts for 32.7% of the total income, industrial and commercial tax accounts for 15.8%, and goods tax accounts for 15.1%, and among the goods tax, cigarette tax ranks first, cotton yarn ranks second, and liquor tax ranks third, and the total of the three items accounts for more than 60%. The key point of grasping the peak season is that the collection of public grain is in July and November, and the industrial and commercial taxes are mainly from September to February of the second year, and the key points are all in winter. In addition, we should put some new income, such as enterprise profits, depreciation, and liquidation income, in an important position.

The key point of expenditure, in particular, is to pay attention to the expenditures that we are not very familiar with and that are flexible, such as national defense construction funds and combat funds in military expenses, basic construction parts in economic undertakings, water conservancy, transportation, health, and other items in undertaking expenses, as well as temporary expenses of government agencies. As for the regular expenses and administrative expenses of the army, government, cultural and educational institutions, and various groups, after years of exploration, it has been proved that the income and expenditure are not large, and it is no longer the key point. The problem in the future is to verify the number of people and adjust the salary treatment of various departments and regions.

As long as we grasp the above key points, we will be confident in income, and expenditures will also be reduced.

Fourth, the establishment of a financial system must meet the actual requirements of the work. Experience has proved that having a system is always better than having no system. With a system, everyone has something to follow in their work, the pace can be consistent, and the national policy can be easily implemented. The system should not be too complicated or repetitive, but should be concise, specific, and appropriate. It should take into account both the development of the work and the ability of cadres to implement it. Therefore, when formulating the system, we must solicit opinions from all parties, mobilize the lower levels to discuss and revise it, or invite responsible comrades from relevant implementing units to participate in the research, in order to make the formulated system conform to the actual situation and be feasible. Last year, when we formulated certain systems, such as the treasury system, it was precisely because we did not go through this kind of top-down and bottom-up research and revision, the result was that it was divorced from reality and difficult to implement. This is a clear proof. In the implementation of the system, our experience is that certain systems that are difficult to implement do not need to be too rigid, and appropriate and flexible modifications should be made in a timely manner in light of the actual situation. That kind of rigid implementation of the system regardless of the actual situation of the work is a subjective approach that is divorced from reality, and the result will greatly delay the work.

Fifth, rectifying the work style of cadres is one of the ways to better complete the task. Before May of last year, because we mainly emphasized the task, we lacked timely education and guidance on the working methods of cadres, so to varying degrees, coercive commandism was generated in some cadres, which aroused the dissatisfaction of some taxpayers and affected the enthusiasm of the people to pay grain and taxes. After May, after educating the cadres, emphasizing handling affairs in accordance with policies, and calling on them to carry out collection work through mass organizations such as people's representatives conferences, farmers' representatives conferences, and industrial and commercial joint conferences, the enthusiasm of the masses to pay grain and taxes turned higher. For example, after adjusting taxes in June, some industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin spontaneously organized to study Director Chen Yun's and Deputy Director Bo Yibo's reports on adjusting taxes, and a number of advanced elements who took the lead in paying taxes emerged. In the summer and autumn collection work last year, many areas, under the influence of cadres taking the lead in paying grain, set off a craze for grain payment competitions. On the basis of levying according to the rate in various places, whether it was industrial and commercial tax or agricultural tax, the tasks were completed and overfulfilled very smoothly. This proves that if the cadres' work style is upright, they can better complete the task, and coercive commands cannot solve any problems.

(III) Guiding Principles and Tasks for Work in 1951

The financial work in 1950 has already achieved great results. The task in 1951 is to consolidate these achieved results and continue to improve on this basis. According to the general outline of the national financial and economic work in 1951 determined by the central government, we believe that the specific guiding principle of this year's financial work should be to consolidate the unified management of fiscal revenue and expenditure, vigorously rectify income, focus on controlling expenditures, establish financial discipline, and strengthen the financial management of enterprises. To this end, we must do the following tasks well this year:

First, strengthen investigation and research and statistical work, gradually understand the national financial resources and tax sources, and start to study and grasp the changes and development rules of urban and rural economy, material exchange, etc. For the urban economy, we should mainly investigate and study the production and operation of public and private industries and commerce, the source of raw materials, and the quantity of fixed capital and working capital, as well as the profit rate, etc., and study the currency turnover, currency capacity, and other issues such as insurance, savings, credit, public bond issuance and sales. For the rural economy, we should start to understand how much land there is in the country, how much output there is, how many cash crops there are, how many large agricultural by-products there are, and we should further conduct land measurement and assessment of production in a planned and step-by-step manner. In terms of taxation, we must vigorously organize income, pay attention to reducing evasion, implement levying according to the rate, and ensure the completion and exceeding of tasks.

Second, strengthen the financial management of state-owned enterprises, must conduct an inventory of the assets of state-owned enterprises, establish and implement the financial revenue and expenditure plan system of state-owned enterprise departments, strengthen the planning of profit and depreciation withdrawals, conduct enterprise financial inspections with key points, and implement a regular reporting system to achieve financial supervision and promote enterprise departments to gradually reduce costs and implement economic accounting systems. In addition, we should actively pay attention to participating in the management of specialized banks and prepare to take over these undertakings in the future.

Third, clarify the financial powers and scope of each level, and strengthen financial discipline. First of all, for things that we should manage, such as insurance and trust, financial departments should take the initiative to understand and study them, so that they can be gradually taken over in the future. Secondly, under the principle of consolidating the unified financial revenue and expenditure management and leadership, establish the financial revenue and expenditure system of each level, implement classified financial management, and pay attention to cultivating local finance, so that they can adapt to local conditions and give play to the enthusiasm of local financial management. To strengthen financial discipline, the main thing is to implement supervision and inspection of national finance, strictly implement the budget and final accounting system and currency management, and for those that can be paid in kind in the budget, the ordering and procurement system should be implemented through the financial and trade departments. Formulate supply and salary standards and preparation plans suitable for all parts of the country, and gradually implement the system of fixed personnel and fixed quotas.

Fourth, strengthen the custody of state public grain and actively deal with surplus grain. In terms of custody, it is required to build more simple warehouses according to the existing strength, increase equipment, cultivate professional cadres, adopt scientific management methods, and strengthen grain quality inspection to reduce losses. In terms of handling surplus grain, we should combine with dispatching work to transport surplus grain and dead-end grain as much as possible to turn it into cash. If it cannot be transported out, it must be processed, manufactured, exchanged, or sold, so as to fully play its financial and economic role.

Fifth, train cadres and improve financial institutions. Training cadres is an important task in the future, and must be carried out in a planned manner. Therefore, we should actively open financial schools, enrich and improve the existing financial colleges, financial schools, tax schools, training courses, etc. in various regions, and entrust universities to train a part of accountants, statisticians, and enterprise financial management cadres. We should also absorb a number of senior tax inspectors, accountants, and enterprise financial management personnel. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the in-service training of cadres, review, educate, unite and retain personnel, and newly recruited intellectuals, and clean up individual bad elements.

Sixth, strengthen inspection work and overcome bureaucracy. This is divided into two aspects. On the one hand, it is necessary to combine with financial supervision to strengthen the inspection of the financial revenue and expenditure of various departments. This requires focusing the main force on on-site inspection to overcome the past style of not knowing the details when reviewing the budget and only knowing how to bargain. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the internal inspection work of the agency, strengthen criticism and self-criticism, so as to overcome the past bad phenomena of more work arrangements, less inspection, pushing, dragging, wrong, chaotic, backlog, and loss of documents, and overcome the transactionalism of the leadership, concentrate on considering major policy issues, and improve the work.

　　一九五零年财政工作总结及一九五一年工作的方针和任务
    中央人民政府财政部副部长  戎子和
    一九五○年的财政工作，是在中央财政经济委员会的直接领导与大力支持之下，本着统一国家财政收支管理，争取财政收支平衡，稳定金融物价的总方针进行的。从一年来改变了的财政形势与工作的成果来看，我们已经基本上贯彻了这个方针。兹将一年来财政工作所取得的主要收获和一些重要经验教训以及一九五一年的工作方针和任务简述如下：
            （一）主要的收获
    第一、统一了国家财政收支管理。去年二月财政会议决定统一全国财政经济工作以后，接着中央又公布了“统一财政收支管理”及“统一国家公粮收支保管调度”的两个决定。在法令方面，先后公布了一九五○年夏征公粮决定、新解放区农业税、工商业税、货物税、印花税、屠宰税、利息所得税、特种消费行为税等暂行条例。在制度方面，则颁布了金库条例，一九五○年全国各级人民政府编制方案和工作人员的供给标准；此外，又陆续拟订和公布了设置财政检查机构办法，预决算编审程序，各种会计制度等一些重要法规。由于这一系列的措施，以及各级人民政府的坚决执行，与全国广大人民的拥护，国家财政工作从一九五○年三月以后，可以说是空前的统一起来了。
    表现在法令制度方面：绝大多数地区均统一执行了中央各项规定，作到全国步调一致，城乡物资交流，并使人民负担逐渐趋向平衡。譬如自建立全国税收日报以来，全国城市税收，包括工商、货物及其他税收，隔日即可得到五十六个较大城市的报告，其数字约占每日各该项全部收入的四分之三，关税、盐税隔日可得到报告的数字，约占每日该两项全部收入的十分之九，其他小城市、乡村以及较小关、卡、盐场的收入，隔旬也能得到全部收入的报告。在征收公粮的季节中，我们每旬大体也可得到全国征收与入库的报告，各地征收的国家公粮大部分可按时入库，使我们随时可以了解全国收入概况。
    表现在收支管理方面：除乡（村）及城市市政建设附加收入和乡村村政小学和城市小学及县简易师范经费的支出外，其他支出，包括区级以上各级人民政府、野战军、地方武装、公安部队、以及由国家供给或补助的机关、学校、团体的预算，均由中央管理起来，并都能按照编制及分配的预算，分月或分季由各级财政部门或后勤部门向中央财政部支领。在现金管理上，我们不只能及时了解全部收入情况，而且每天可根据税收以及金库解款的报告，开发支票，支拨款项。由于这样统一了收支管理，就使我们可以有重点地分别轻重缓急，支配开支，因而得以集中力量供给军队。在粮食供应方面，基本上作到军队走到那里，粮食即可送到那里，另外我们还拿出六十亿斤公粮交中央贸易部调剂城市，十亿斤公粮（现款在外）救济灾荒与城市失业工人。
    再从一年来各区财政情况看，在实现统一管理财政收支以前和以后，有着显著的不同。第一季度各区上解中央的数字为全年上解数的百分之七点九，中央补助各区数字为全年补助的百分之四三，到了第四季度上解数即达三九·九，补助数字降为一四·七，这虽有历史的及工作的诸种关系，而统一收支管理实为主要的因素。应该特别指出，过去这一年各大行政区各省（市）以及各部门，在贯彻统一财政掌握收支方面，表现是很好的，绝大多数地区都能体会国家财政困难，做到多上解，少支出，这是我们财政工作取得成绩的重要原因之一。
    第二、出现了收支接近平衡的局面。财政收支接近平衡，是一九五○年财政工作成功的集中表现。根据一九四九年十二月中央人民政府通过的一九五○年财政收支概算来看：
    收入方面，比原概算超过百分之三一·七。公债发行，约为原概算百分之七○·四。从城市税收的情况看：第一季度收入占全年收入的百分之一六·五，第二季度占百分之二一·六，第三季度占百分之二三·三，第四季度占百分之三八·六。关税、盐税逐季增加的比例，亦大体如此。税收增加的基本因素，固然是全国财经统一以后所带来的物价平稳、物资交流以及经济恢复等有利条件，但我们主观上的努力，应该说是创造这些条件的基本前提。
    支出方面，超过百分之一四。从各季度的现金支出情况来看：第一季度占全年支出百分之二一·四，第二季度占百分之二五·五，第三季度占百分之二四·四，第四季度占百分之二八·七。以上支出数字，增加最大的是国防费和社会事业费，这主要是因救济灾荒和失业工人，支援前线的缘故，但另一方面，由于核实人数，行政费减少，总的变动是不大的。
    以上收支相抵，赤字占总实支出的百分之十六·七，占原概算赤字的百分之九六·六，除以发行公债、苏联贷款弥补外，银行透支比原概算还少百分之一三·一，另从各季开支的财政赤字比率来看：第一季度为百分之四三，第二季度为百分之四○，（使用公债推销款在内），第三季度降为百分之九·八，第四季度更降至百分之六·四，说明我们国家财政的收支是逐渐趋向平衡，接近了平衡的，这是我们一个很大的胜利。不过所提示的数字只是就我们已得材料统计而来，其中有些收支结算后可能还有增减，但总的趋势，是可以看出来了。
    第三、金融物价趋向平稳。由于我们财政收支接近平衡，全国金融物价即起了显著的变化。根据中国人民银行总行统计，如以一九四九年十二月为基期，则一九五○年全国六大城市三十二种主要商品的加权指数是：一月为一二一·二，二月为一七七·三，三月为二一○·九，四月为一七三·四，五月为一五四·六，六月为一六三·七，七月为一七八·二，八月为一八二·六，九月为一八五·二，十月为一九二·七七，十一月为二○一·七，十二月为一九九·七，总指数为一七八·五，如用贸易部的统计资料，则同一基期的全年总指数仅一七七·四。由此可以看出，一九五○年第一季度各月的物价是急剧上涨的，从四月开始即趋下降，六月调整公私关系后，便转为平稳了，七月以后，虽因美国帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜，某些进口物品价格稍有波动，但人民生活必需品如粮食、纱布、燃料等物价，仍是稳定的。从此由国民党遗留下来十三年的长期物价飞涨，市场不安的紊乱局面，已基本上不存在了，由于这一形势的扭转，就给我们财政供给工作提供了极其顺利的条件，这不能不说是我们财政收支平衡后获得的一个伟大果实。
    一年来的事实证明，中国人民完全是可以不依靠帝国主义的所谓“援助”即能把自己的财政工作治理得很好，某些人们说人民政府“对财政经济工作无办法”的谰言，已被铁的事实粉碎了。
            （二）几个重要的经验教训
    根据以上所述，一九五○年我们的工作成绩是很大的，但错误和缺点也不少。主要是我们在执行二月财政会议时，没有很好地研究和贯彻毛主席指示的四面八方的方向和共同纲领第四十条所规定的简化税制，实行合理负担的税收政策。而只片面地强调完成税收任务，忽视因片面强调税收任务，对恢复和发展生产以及经济交流方面所发生的不利影响，因此，在一定的时间内，我们对工商界的某些困难情形和一部分干部强迫命令的作风，表现得注意不够，以致产生某些偏差。在法令制度方面，我们所订的有些税法和试行草案也欠妥善，如货物税、印花税、特种消费行为税、房地产税、交易税等都有毛病，特别是货物税中的税种、税目、税率和手续的规定是有很大缺点。盐税的税率开始订的太高了，新解放区农业税暂行条例则公布得太迟，同时一个税率也很难适合广大新解放区农业的经济情况，在所订立的制度中有些因要求太高，规定的不尽符合实际。同时我们对政策的原则性和灵活性运用不强，掌握重点不够，因而在工作中常犯“抓小辫子”的缺点，在作风上则有官僚主义和事务主义毛病，并常发生因循贻误和错误的情事，由于这些事实的存在，一年来给我们的经验教训是很丰富的。
    第一、使我们更深刻地体会了从经济到财政的道路。“从经济到财政”是毛主席早已指示过的，但我们在实际工作中，却往往离开了这一原则。去年三、四月间我们曾用了很大力量突击征收，结果不但弄得大家喊叫，而任务亦未完成。经过六月调整公私关系和调整税收的措施。九月以后，税收即逐渐增加，第四季度的收入竟达全年税收的百分之三八·六。这固然与税收的淡旺季及年景丰歉有关系，但政府对城市私营工厂实行加工订货，在农村扩大收购土产等措施，是增加税收的主要原因。说明只要城乡物资交流实现，工农业生产有了出路，市场经济繁荣起来，税收即可完成并可超过。反之，只管强调收入，而忽略培养税源，不很关心经济和生产情况，这种做法是错误的。因此我们厘定税率就要恰当，超过或者不及，不是损伤了经济，便影响财政，如去年二届税务会议后盐税减低了一半，不但未影响完成任务，并促进了盐的运销。其次要简化税制，繁了就要打击生产，限制物资交流，如去年调整税收后，货物税税目由一一三八种减并为三五八种，其中并有四十种废除货照同行的分运手续，另又废除了多种货品的改制和改装手续，提高了分运量；印花税则由三十目减为二十五目，结果非但税收未因此而受到影响，反而好处很多。
    第二、依率计征，解决了“任务与政策矛盾”的错误看法。过去我们对农业税和工商业税的征收，多是采用按照各地经济情况分配任务的方法进行，因而多年以来即有所谓“任务与政策矛盾”之说，始终未得到圆满解决。去年六月前后，我们提出无论农业工商等税一律实行依率计征，但这样究竟能否完成任务，当时尚不能肯定。经过去年秋冬两季实行依率计征的结果，农业税超征了十数亿斤，好多地区的工商业税亦超过估计的任务。这样，不仅使干部可以依照政策法令办事，完成了任务，并可使纳税人了解负担的数目，获得广大农民与工商界的拥护，解决了我们好多年来税收工作中的一个大问题。
    第三、抓重点掌握收支。收入的重点，主要是要注意收入的旺季，收入多的地区和城市，以及主要的税收和企业收入。如工商货物税华东约占全国百分之四一·六，上海、天津、广州、青岛、武汉、沈阳、北京、重庆等八大城市即占全国百分之五十弱，其中上海占百分之二三，天津占百分之一六。在大城市中则要注意大户，如上海在一三七、○○○工商户中，四千家大户的税，即占全市百分之七十，天津三八、五九五户中，八四六家大户的纳税占百分之五六·五。在各税的比重上，农业税占全部收入百分之三二·七，工商税占百分之一五·八，货物税占百分之一五·一，而货物税中纸烟税占第一，棉纱第二，酒税第三，三项合计占百分之六十以上。掌握旺季主要是公粮征收是在七月和十一月，工商各税主要是自九月到第二年度的二月，重点都在冬季。此外并要把某些新的收入，如企业利润折旧提缴清仓收入放在重要的地位。
    支出的重点，特别是要注意我们所不甚熟悉的而又有弹性的开支，如军费中的国防建设费与作战费，经济事业费中的基本建设部分，事业费中的水利、交通、卫生等项，以及政府机关之临时费等开支。至于军队、政府、文教机关以及各团体的经常费和行政费，经过多年来的摸索，证明出入是不大的，已不是重点，今后的问题乃是核实人数和调整各部门和地区的薪金待遇。
    只要抓住上述重点，则收入就有把握，支出也就会减少漏洞。
    第四、建立财政制度必须切合工作实际要求。经验证明：有制度总比无制度好，有了制度，大家在工作上才有所遵循，步调才能一致，国家政策便容易贯彻下去。制度不能太繁琐或重复，要做到扼要、具体、适当，应当兼顾到工作发展和干部执行能力。因此，在制定制度时，就必须多方面征询意见，发动下边多讨论修正，或邀集有关执行单位负责同志参加研究，以期所制定的制度符合实际，执行得通，去年我们在制定某些制度时，如金库制度等，即因未经过这种自上而下和自下而上的研究与修正，结果脱离实际，窒碍难行，即是明证。在执行制度上，我们的经验是某些难以行得通的制度，不必过于拘泥，应适时地针对现实情况作适当的灵活的修改。那种不顾工作实际情况，死板的执行制度，乃是脱离实际的主观主义的作法，结果反要大大地贻误工作。
    第五、整顿干部作风，是更好地完成任务的方法之一。去年五月以前，由于我们主要强调任务，对干部的工作方法缺少及时的教育与指导，因而在部分干部中或多或少地产生了强迫命令主义，引起某些纳税人的不满，影响人民缴粮纳税的热情。五月以后，经过对干部的教育，强调按政策办事，并号召要通过各界人民代表会议、农民代表会议，工商业者联席会等群众组织，进行征收工作，群众缴粮纳税的情绪即转而提高，如在六月调整税收后，天津部分工商业者曾自动组织起来学习陈云主任、薄一波副主任关于调整税收的报告，涌现出若干带头纳税的积极分子。在去年夏征和秋征工作中，许多地区在干部带头纳粮的影响下，掀起了纳粮竞赛的热潮，各地在依率计征基础上，无论工商业税或农业税，均很顺利地完成并超额地完成了任务，这证明：干部作风端正，就能更好地完成任务，而强迫命令，是不能解决任何问题的。
            （三）一九五一年的工作方针与任务
    一九五○年的财政工作，已经获得了很大的成绩，一九五一年的任务即在巩固这种既得的成绩，并在这个基础上继续提高一步，根据中央确定的一九五一年全国财政经济工作总纲，我们认为今年财政工作的具体方针应该是巩固财政收支的统一管理，大力整顿收入，重点掌握开支，建立财政纪律与加强企业财务管理。为此，我们必须在今年做好以下几件工作：
    第一、加强调查研究及统计工作，逐步了解全国的财源和税源，着手研究和掌握城乡经济，物资交流等变化和发展规律。对城市经济，主要应调查研究公私工商业生产经营情况，原料来源及固定资金和流动资金数量以至利润率等，并研究货币周转情况，货币容纳量，以及保险、储蓄、信贷、公债发行及推销等诸问题。对农村经济，应着手了解全国农村有多少土地，多少产量，多少经济作物，多少大宗农业副产品，并应进一步有计划有步骤地进行丈地评产，在税收上要大力组织收入，注意减少偷漏，贯彻依率计征，保障任务的完成与超过。
    第二、加强国营企业财务的管理，必须进行清点国营企业的资产，建立执行国营企业部门财务收支计划制度，加强提缴利润和折旧的计划性，有重点地进行企业财务检查，实行定期的表报制度，以实现财政监督，促使企业部门逐步降低成本，实行经济核算制。此外并应积极注意参与专业银行的管理工作，并准备将来接管这些事业。
    第三、明确各级财政职权与范围，加强财政纪律。首先凡属我们应管的事如保险信托等财政部门，应主动地进行了解与研究，以便将来逐渐接管，其次在巩固统一财政收支管理与领导原则下，确立各级财政收支系统，实行财政分级管理，并注意培养地方财政，使能因地制宜，发挥地方管理财政的积极性。加强财政纪律，主要的为对国家财政实行监督与监察，严格执行预决算制度及货币管理，凡预算中可用实物支付的应通过财政贸易部门实行定货采购制度，制定适合全国各地的供给薪资标准和编制方案，逐步实行定员定额制。
    第四、加强国家公粮的保管和积极处理余粮。在保管方面，要求根据现有力量多建简易仓库，增加设备，培养专业干部，采用科学的管理方法，加强粮质检查，以减少损耗。在处理余粮方面，则应结合调度工作，尽量将余粮和死角粮运出变成现款，不能运出的则须予以加工、制造、兑换或变卖，期使充分发挥财政经济上的作用。
    第五、培养干部健全财政机构。培养干部是今后一项重要的工作，必须有计划地进行。因此应积极开办财政学校，充实健全各区现有的财政学院、财政学校、税务学校、训练班等，并委托各大学训练一部分会计、统计、及企业财务管理等干部，吸收若干高级税务检查员、会计员、企业财务管理人员，同时还应注意轮训在职干部，审查、教育、团结留用人员及新参加工作的知识分子，洗刷个别坏分子。
    第六、加强检查工作，克服官僚主义。这分两方面，一面是要结合财政监督，加强对各部门财务收支的检查，这就必须将主要力量放在现场检查上，以克服过去在审核预算时不摸底细，只知道讨价还价的作风，另一方面要加强机关内部的检查工作加强批评与自我批评，以克服过去对工作布置多，检查少，推、拖、错、乱、积压、丢失文电等不良现象，并克服领导上的事务主义，集中力量考虑大的政策问题，把工作提高一步。
