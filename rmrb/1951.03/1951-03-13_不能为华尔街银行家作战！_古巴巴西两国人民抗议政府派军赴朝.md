　　Cannot Fight for Wall Street Bankers!
    People of Cuba and Brazil Protest Government Sending Troops to Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th] TASS dispatch from New York on the 7th: The movement of the people of Latin American countries protesting against their governments' attempts to send troops to Korea is expanding.
    According to the Associated Press correspondent in Havana, the Cuban newspaper *Alerta* reported that so-called "disciplinary violations" have occurred in the Cuban armed forces in protest against the government's decision to send a thousand soldiers to Korea. The newspaper stated that in recent days, several officers have been arrested and dismissed for refusing to go to Korea. In view of the current tense situation, Cuban President Socarras convened a meeting with newspaper editors, requesting them not to publish news that "could help the enemy." According to a Continental News Agency dispatch from Havana, even some conservatives, under pressure from the masses, have expressed opposition to sending troops outside Cuban territory.
    *Alerta* published a series of essays by former Cuban Ambassador to the United States and Representative to the United Nations, Belt, who urged the Cuban Congress to reject the President's proposal to send troops to Korea.
    The Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a statement saying: "Hundreds of thousands of mothers, wives, sisters, and fiancées are demanding: do not send any Cubans to Korea to fight in such a barbaric and unjust war for the interests of Wall Street bankers and Cuban landowners."
    A recent issue of the Brazilian progressive newspaper *Workers' Voice* reported that the municipal councils of some Brazilian cities have passed resolutions protesting the government's attempt to send troops to Korea. The newspaper also reported that sailors on the Peruvian merchant ship "Amazonas" refused to transport Brazilian rice to Korea for the American interventionists.

　　不能为华尔街银行家作战！
    古巴巴西两国人民抗议政府派军赴朝
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：拉丁美洲各国人民抗议政府企图派遣军队去朝鲜的运动正在扩大中。
    据美联社驻哈瓦那记者称，古巴《警觉报》报道，为了抗议政府派遣一千名士兵前往朝鲜的决定，古巴武装部队中发生所谓“破坏纪律事件”。该报称，在最近几天中，有若干军官因为拒绝前往朝鲜而被逮捕和解职。古巴总统苏加拉斯鉴于当前的紧张局势，曾召集报界编辑谈话，要求他们不要发表“可以帮助敌人”的消息。据大陆通讯社哈瓦那消息，甚至若干保守人士也在人民大众的压力下表示反对派遣军队离开古巴国境。
    《警觉报》发表前古巴驻美大使和驻联合国代表贝尔特的一系列的论文，他敦促古巴国会否决总统关于派遣部队去朝鲜的提案。
    古巴人民社会党发表声明称：“几十万母亲、妻子、姊妹、未婚妻都要求：不要把任何一个古巴人派到朝鲜去，去为华尔街银行家和古巴地主的利益在这样野蛮的非正义的战争中作战。”
    最近一期巴西进步报纸《工人呼声》报道，巴西某些城市的市政委员会曾通过决议，抗议政府企图派遣军队去朝鲜。该报又报道秘鲁商船“阿马索那斯”号的海员也拒绝为美国干涉者将巴西米运往朝鲜。
