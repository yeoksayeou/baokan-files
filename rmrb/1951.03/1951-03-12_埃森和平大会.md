　　Essen Peace Conference
    Question: The resolution of the First World Peace Council on the peaceful settlement of the German question pointed out "the achievements of the Essen Peace Conference". We are not familiar with the Essen Peace Conference. Please, editor, introduce its course and significance.
          Reader Zhang Wei et al.
    Answer: The Essen Peace Conference was the first congress of West German advocates against remilitarization, held in Essen, the central city of the Ruhr area, on January 28 this year, by hundreds of peace advocates from various states in West Germany. The delegates to the conference included workers, residents, journalists, social figures, and former soldiers from various states in West Germany. The conference sent a declaration to the Bonn "government," representing the German people, demanding a referendum on the question of "Are you against the remilitarization of West Germany and in favor of signing a peace treaty with Germany in 1951?" The declaration pointed out that the decision of the United States and the West German puppet government on the rearmament of West Germany had not been approved by the German people and was firmly opposed by the German people. The conference put forward concrete ways to solve the German problem. The declaration stated: "We care about the future of our country. We call on all parties, trade unions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church, individuals, groups, and various committees to support the demand to the Federal 'Government' to hold a referendum." The declaration finally pointed out: "If the German people use their democratic rights to decide their own destiny, to decide the question of war or peace, and express their protest against remilitarization through a referendum, then obstacles will arise on the road to the Third World War, and peace can be saved." The conference elected a preparatory committee including representatives of all strata of people in West Germany to uniformly lead the West German people in the movement to protest against remilitarization.
    The Essen Peace Conference is a powerful manifestation of the West German people's opposition to the rearmament of West Germany. The breadth of the representatives of this conference and the specificity of the methods it proposed have had a huge and important impact and role among the vast West German people, and have become a powerful call for the West German people to oppose American imperialism's rearmament of West Germany.
    Now, on the basis laid by the Essen Peace Conference, the West German people are negotiating to prepare for the establishment of a "Central Committee against Remilitarization" to centrally lead the struggle of the people in the entire U.S., British, and French occupied areas against the rearmament of West Germany. To this end, the Central Preparatory Committee was held in Dusseldorf on February 25 to discuss holding a national referendum on the issue of West German remilitarization. Representatives from local committees in Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Hamburg, Bremen, Dusseldorf, and other places attended the meeting.
    Under the leadership of the soon-to-be-established "Central Committee against Remilitarization," the West German people's movement against remilitarization will inevitably achieve more extensive and in-depth development. The struggle against the American rearmament of West Germany, carried out by the vast West German people together with the entire German people and the peace-loving people of the world, will surely be able to frustrate the American aggressive plan to drive the West German people to serve as its cannon fodder for aggression.

　　埃森和平大会
    问：第一届世界和平理事会关于以和平方式解决德国问题的决议，曾指出“埃森和平大会的成就”，我们对埃森和平大会不够了解，请编辑同志对它的经过与意义介绍一下。
          读者  张维等
    答：埃森和平大会，是西德各州数百名和平拥护者于今年一月二十八日在鲁尔区的中心城市埃森召开的西德反对重新军国主义化第一届代表大会。大会的代表包括西德各州的工人、居民、新闻记者、社会人士与从前的军人等。大会以宣言一件送致波恩“政府”，代表德国人民要求就“你反对西德重新军国主义化和赞成在一九五一年签订对德和约吗？”这一个问题，举行公民投票。宣言指出，美国与西德傀儡政府关于重新武装西德的决定，未经德国人民同意，而为德国人民所坚决反对。大会提出了解决德国问题的具体途径，宣言声称：“我们关心我们国家的将来，我们号召一切党派、工会、天主教会与福音教会、个人、团体与各种委员会，支持向联邦‘政府’提出关于举行公民投票的要求”。宣言最后指出：“如果德国人民利用他们的民主权利来自行决定他们的命运，来决定战争或和平的问题，并且借公民投票来表示抗议重新军国主义化的话，那么，走向第三次世界大战的道路上就会发生障碍，和平就可以挽救了。”大会选出了一个包括西德各阶层人民代表在内的筹备委员会，以便统一领导西德人民进行抗议重新军国主义化的运动。
    埃森和平大会是西德人民反对重新武装西德的有力的表现。这次大会代表的广泛性与它所提出的办法的具体性，使它在广大的西德人民中间发生了不容忽视的巨大影响与重要作用，而成为西德人民反对美帝国主义重新武装西德的有力的号召。
    现在，在埃森和平大会所奠定的基础上，西德人民正协议筹备成立“反对重新军国主义化中央委员会”，以集中领导整个美、英、法占领区人民进行反对重新武装西德的斗争。为此而成立的中央筹备委员会，已于二月二十五日在杜塞尔多夫开会，讨论在全国就西德重新军国主义化问题举行公民投票的问题。参加会议的有慕尼黑、纽伦堡、奥格斯堡、汉堡、不来梅、杜塞尔多夫等各地方委员会的代表。
    在即将成立的“反对重新军国主义化中央委员会”的领导之下，西德人民反对重新军国主义化的运动，将必然得到更广泛与更深入的发展。广大的西德人民与全德人民及世界爱好和平人民在一道所进行的反对美国重新武装西德的斗争，是一定能够挫败美国驱使西德人民充当其侵略炮灰的侵略计划的。
