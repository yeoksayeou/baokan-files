　　Experiences from the Yuchi Anti-American, Aid-Korea Movement

　　The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country in Yuchi County, Shanxi Province, began in November of last year and continued through January of this year. The movement progressed from the city to the countryside, from cadre study to public outreach and mobilization of the masses for patriotic action. It gradually expanded and deepened, steadily building to a climax, and truly forming a mass-based anti-American patriotic political movement.
　　In the initial phase, the focus was on educating cadres. In addition to organizing all cadres for study, reports were given and study was organized at various meetings (cadre meetings, meetings of representatives from all sectors, labor model meetings, militia review meetings) and training courses (Party members, League members, military, teachers, assessors). In the urban areas, various promotional activities were organized for teachers and students, wall newspapers were published, and current affairs lectures were established at cinemas to promote awareness among citizens. At that time, two main ideas among cadres hindered deeper study: one was the complacency towards the enemy among some veteran cadres, and the other was fear and admiration of America among some new cadres. At an expanded cadre meeting on November 20th, the Yuchi County leadership focused on resolving the above two issues, adopting a method of reporting, discussion, and bold exposure. A total of seventy or eighty questions were raised at that time, the vast majority concerning "the atomic bomb" and "world war." Some new cadres even suggested, "Peace requires one side to give in," and some did not approve of aiding Korea, fearing it would stir up trouble. After explanations and organized discussion and debate by the county leadership, some resolution was achieved, but it was far from thorough. Later, it was decided to conduct two hours of current affairs study every day in December. In early December, a number of counter-revolutionary slogans were discovered in the streets of the city, and at the same time, a cadre from the Grain Company was dragged out and beaten to death by special agents while sleeping at night. The Yuchi County CCP Committee seized upon this fact to mobilize all cadres, calling on everyone to heighten vigilance, overcome complacency, recognize the enemy, and build up fighting spirit. After this painful lesson, most veteran cadres underwent a transformation; some who had previously wanted to go home now expressed their desire to work hard. Through study, the thinking of new cadres was also improved, and more than forty people requested to go to Korea to join the volunteer army, thus the movement to resist America and aid Korea initially had a core group of activists.
　　At the same time, the promotional work in the urban areas gradually became more in-depth. The method was as follows: through the Federation of Industry and Commerce, all managers and shop assistants from all trades and industries were organized into nineteen lecture groups for study, with 1,519 participants; in addition, two handicraft industry lecture groups were organized, with 366 participants; citizens mainly studied in ten winter schools; schools changed political classes to current affairs classes, history classes to lectures on the history of American aggression against China, and geography classes to lectures on the geography of Korea. Merchants had also begun to be mobilized. They recalled and denounced the painful experiences and crimes of the Japanese puppet regime and the Yan Xishan bandits, such as closing businesses, unstable prices, exorbitant taxes and levies, and drafting soldiers. They realized that if the American imperialists came, the Yan bandits would return, American goods would be dumped, and they would have no way to survive. At the same time, they compared their experiences with the past two years since liberation, during which business had been booming due to stable prices and industrial and commercial adjustments, thereby arousing their hatred for the enemy, breaking down their erroneous belief that "whoever comes, it’s all about doing business," establishing the idea that "if we all work hard, we can achieve victory," and understanding the loveliness of the new society and the new country. During the fourth quarter assessment of industrial and commercial taxes, many people voluntarily reported higher figures than the third quarter, and all taxes were paid within three days. On New Year's Day, people from all walks of life held a grand demonstration parade of more than 7,000 people, with 1,300 people from the industrial and commercial sector participating, and formulated six patriotic pledges, which were printed and distributed to various businesses for common adherence. Afterwards, the various lecture groups in the industrial and commercial sector continued to insist on regular study and organized their own theatrical troupes to carry out regular promotional work.
　　By early December of last year, the movement had spread to the countryside. Communist Party members and cadres in rural branches first organized study, and then went to mobilize the masses, using winter schools as the main platform for anti-American, aid-Korea education. During the process, meetings were held for the elderly, youth, women, militia, intellectuals in the countryside, honorary soldiers and demobilized soldiers, and families of soldiers, based on the development of the movement. While explaining current affairs, everyone was encouraged to freely expose different thoughts and understandings, develop debates, and guide the masses to recall and denounce the brutal acts of the Japanese invaders when they ruled, such as seizing grain, drafting soldiers, killing people, and raping women, as well as the Yan bandits' "Three Selfs Training," "Confession and Rebirth," and "Soldiers and Farmers Combined," which led to families being ruined and people eating grass seeds and tree bark. After understanding the criminal facts of American imperialism colluding with Japan, Chiang, and Yan to kill the Chinese people, the peasant masses unanimously realized that "no imperialist is good," and "Japan, the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan are all in cahoots." Then, the peasants further denounced the crimes of landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and the Yiguandao sect, and finally completely drew a line between ourselves and the enemy. The peasants also compared their happy life and master status after liberation with the situation before liberation, and therefore they deeply felt the loveliness of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army. Many peasants said, "The red flour (sorghum flour) we eat has the blood of the Eighth Route Army in it." Their conclusion was: "If American soldiers come in, Yan Xishan comes back, and the landlords rise up, the common people will suffer." In this way, the peasant masses' fighting spirit to resist America and aid Korea quickly rose.
　　On the basis of enhanced political consciousness, the peasants consciously demanded action. Many people said: "Just talking empty words cannot resist the enemy, we must do practical work!" The masses shouted the slogan "Rather be masters than slaves!" The youth raised the resounding slogan: "Be heroes, not cowards!" In Dongnie Village alone, more than eighty people volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the war; more than sixty women said they would never hold their men back; and more than twenty others declared their withdrawal from the Yiguandao sect. The village completed the supplementary collection of arrears of grain within two days. In addition, the peasants in various villages voluntarily donated a large number of comfort items, wrote many letters of sympathy, comforted the glorious military families and the People's Liberation Army, and strengthened the forces to resist America and aid Korea.
　　The main achievements of the movement can be seen from the following aspects:
　　First, this movement involved all strata of the masses, its breadth and depth surpassing any previous period. The twenty-one self-run lecture groups in the industrial and commercial sector in the urban areas included a total of 1,885 people from managers to shop assistants in various trades and industries. In the rural areas, more than 40% of the masses in 15 villages in four districts were involved in the movement, with the participation rate reaching 80% in a few villages such as Dazhangyi. Not only did the vast majority of young and middle-aged people and women actively participate, but even the elderly, who had never been concerned with national affairs, were also involved, and many became activists. Not only did the peasants who had been emancipated and the intellectuals actively participate, but also some former landlords, rich peasants, and some former enemy puppet personnel participated, demonstrating the further expansion and consolidation of the anti-imperialist united front, creating a high tide of the anti-American patriotic movement.
　　Second, on the basis of a general increase in patriotic awareness, a large number of new activists emerged among the peasant masses. According to statistics from 52 villages in the county, a total of 1,382 activists emerged from the rural masses, and 318 village cadres became activists. A total of 280 activists were found among Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in the first, fourth, and fifth districts. The prestige of the Party and the League was greatly enhanced during the movement, and the vast majority of young people requested to join the League and participate in the militia. According to incomplete statistics, through the movement to resist America and aid Korea, 387 militiamen were developed in 46 villages, and 90 members of the Communist Youth League were developed in 13 villages, thus strengthening the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside.
　　Third, the movement to resist America and aid Korea also tested and educated the working cadres. In the heat of the mass movement, the working cadres clearly recognized the direction of the struggle and strengthened their will to fight. According to statistics from four districts, 152 village cadres who had previously been lying down on the job and had serious ideological problems became active through this movement. Among Party and League members, 53 Party members and 90 League members became active through the movement. The working face of many villages was completely renewed. For example, the villages of Bada, Shitie, and Xichangshou were transformed from third-class villages to first-class villages.
　　Fourth, the movement moved towards a climax, the activities of counter-revolutionaries decreased, and rumors were not heard. During the movement, the masses denounced the criminal facts of some counter-revolutionaries, exposed six current criminals, and the government immediately detained them. Other elements with reactionary behavior were also strictly criticized by the peasants and publicly bowed their heads to the masses. The peasant masses also implemented control over a small number of illegal landlords, forcing them to reform themselves through labor. At this time, the peasant masses truly felt that they were the masters of society, thus renewing the social atmosphere in the countryside.
　　Finally, the movement gave the Party's staff at all levels a lesson in the mass line, making them truly understand the truth that "once a theory is grasped by the masses, it becomes a material force," thus breaking the original erroneous belief of some staff members that the masses in the new districts were backward, deeply influenced by the Yan bandits' reactionary propaganda, and did not trust us. Everyone felt that the emotions of the Yuchi masses had never been so high, even higher than during the land reform in 1949; and the closeness and trust shown by the masses towards the Chinese Communist Party was also unprecedented, and the progress of all work had never been so smooth. The reasons for this are mainly: 1. In the past, all work started only from tasks, simple style, administrative orders, without mobilizing and leading the masses, that is, without taking the mass line. 2. Although land reform was carried out in 1949, the ideological mobilization of the masses was insufficient. 3. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was not timely or was not suppressed, and the masses had opinions about us. 4. The specific work tasks were not combined with the overall political struggle tasks for education.
　　In general, the Yuchi County's movement to resist America and aid Korea has the following experiences:
　　First, the leading organs must personally take charge, personally take action, and treat this historic political task not as a simple study movement or propaganda movement, but as a mass self-education political and ideological movement, as a powerful weapon to mobilize the masses politically and ideologically and promote the development of various tasks. The reason why the Yuchi County's movement to resist America and aid Korea achieved the above-mentioned results is primarily due to the fact that the Secretary of the Yuchi County CCP Committee personally led the movement and mobilized all Party members and cadres to carry it out.
　　Second, explaining current affairs, recalling the past, denouncing the enemy, and comparing life and status before and after liberation are the main methods of mobilizing the masses to draw a line between ourselves and the enemy, inspiring patriotic enthusiasm, establishing anti-American ideas, and stimulating the will to fight. Simple "cadre speaks and masses listen" preaching, without touching the specific ideas of the masses, without connecting with the masses' personal experiences and interests, will not form conscious action by the masses.
　　Third, the movement to resist America and aid Korea must be closely combined with the current work. This work should neither be placed on a par with other work nor be carried out in isolation, but should be regarded as the central link of all work. Experience has shown that anti-American and patriotic ideological education is a constant driving force for production, grain payment, tax payment, winter schools, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and banning of Yiguandao.
　　Fourth, cultivating and training a large number of activists as the backbone of the movement through various meetings and training classes, and mobilizing the masses through them is the method of making the movement develop universally. In the city, lecture groups can be organized in various industries and trades, giving play to their own role in organizing themselves. In the countryside, according to the development of the movement, symposiums for various people can be convened in a timely manner to cultivate activists of various people, so that they can return to the masses and play the role of yeast, which is the best form of mass self-education.
　　At present, the development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea in Yuchi's rural areas is still very uneven. The above is mainly based on the situation in 82 key villages (accounting for 40% of the 208 villages in the county) and the urban areas. The county's future task is to make the movement universally carried out, so that every village and everyone is educated about patriotism to resist America and aid Korea. In the villages where mobilization has already taken place, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and deepen, and prevent cadres and the masses from becoming complacent and "taking a breather." Anti-American patriotic ideological education is a long-term task. If we want to truly and firmly establish the patriotic thinking of the people and make it a constant driving force for carrying out various tasks, we must continue to carry out the education of resisting America and aiding Korea as a serious political task.

### 榆次抗美援朝运动的经验

　　榆次抗美援朝运动的经验
    山西省榆次县的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，自去年十一月开始到今年一月，运动是由城市到农村，由干部学习到向群众宣传和发动群众的爱国行动的，是逐步扩大和深入，逐步走向高潮，而真正形成了一个反美爱国群众性的政治运动。
    在开始阶段，以教育干部为主，除组织所有干部进行学习外，在各种会议（干部会、各界代表会、劳动模范会、民兵检阅会）和各种训练班（党员、团员、武装、教员、评丈）都作了报告，组织了学习。在城关组织了教员、学生的各种宣传活动，出版了墙报，设立了电影院的时事讲座等，对市民进行宣传。当时干部中有两种主要思想妨碍着学习的深入，一种是一部分老干部对敌人的麻痹，另一种是一部分新干部的恐美、崇美思想。榆次县的领导机关在十一月二十日的扩干会上，着重对以上两种思想加以解决，采取报告讨论，大胆暴露的办法。当时一共提出了七、八十条问题，绝大多数是“原子弹”和“世界大战”，有的新干部甚至提出：“和平总得有一家让步才行”，有的不赞成援朝，怕惹出祸来。经过该县领导机关的讲解和组织讨论争辩，得到一些解决，但很不彻底。以后决定在十二月份每天进行两小时时事学习。十二月初，城内各街曾发现不少反革命标语，同时，粮食公司有一干部在晚上睡觉时被特务拖出打死。该县中共县委抓住这一事实向所有干部作了动员，号召大家提高警惕，克服麻痹思想，认清敌人，树立斗志。经过这次痛苦的教训，老干部大部有了转变，甚至有的以前想回家的，这时也表示要好好工作。经过学习，新干部的思想也有所提高，并有四十余人要求到朝鲜去参加志愿军，这样抗美援朝运动就初步有了骨干分子。
    与此同时，城关的宣传工作逐渐走向深入。作法是：通过工商联合会把各行各业的所有经理、店员组织在十九个讲座里进行学习，参加者一千五百十九人；另外组织了手工业讲座两个，参加者三百六十六人；市民则主要是在十座冬学里进行学习；学校把政治课改为时事课，历史课讲美国侵华史，地理课讲朝鲜的地理。商人也已开始发动，他们回忆和控诉日伪阎匪统治时期的关门歇业、物价不稳、苛捐杂税及派款抓兵等痛苦和敌人罪行，联系认识到如果美帝进来，阎匪回来、美货倾销、自己就没有活路了。同时，对比了解放二年来，由于物价平稳，工商业的调整，生意蒸蒸日上，从而激起了对敌人的仇恨，打破了他们中的“谁来也是做买卖”的错误认识，树立了“大家努力，就能取得胜利”的思想，并体会了新社会新国家的可爱。在第四季工商业税评议时，不少人自报数比第三季评议数还要高，全部税款在三天之内缴纳完毕。新年元旦各界人民举行了七千余人盛大的示威游行，工商界有一千三百人参加，并制定了六项爱国公约，印发给各商号，共同信守。以后工商界的各个讲座仍坚持经常学习，并且组织了自己的剧团，以进行经常的宣传工作。
    至去年十二月初，运动即向农村发展。中共农村支部党员和干部首先组织学习，随即分头发动群众，以冬学为进行抗美援朝教育的主要依托。在进行中又根据运动发展情况分别召开老年人、青年、妇女、民兵、在乡知识分子、荣誉军人和退伍军人、军人家属等各种人的会议。在讲解时事中，同时启发大家自由暴露各种不同的思想认识，发展争辩，并引导群众回忆和控诉日寇统治时的抢粮、抓兵、杀人、奸淫等残暴行为，和阎匪的“三自传训”、“自白转生”、“兵农合一”，弄得家破人亡，吃草籽、树皮的痛苦生活。在懂得了美帝国主义和日、蒋、阎相互勾结杀害中国人民的罪恶事实后，农民群众一致认清了“帝国主义没有一个好东西”，“日、美、蒋、阎都是一个鼻孔出气”。接着，农民们又进一步控诉了地主、反革命分子和一贯道的罪恶，最后完全划清了敌我的界线。农民们又将解放后的幸福生活和主人地位，与解放前的情形作了对比，因而他们就深深地感到共产党、人民政府和人民解放军的可爱。许多农民都说：“咱们吃的红面（高粱面）里头都有八路军的血哩。”他们的结论是：“美国兵进来，阎锡山回来，地主起来，老百姓就要倒霉。”就这样，农民群众的抗美援朝的斗争情绪便迅速高涨起来了。
    在政治觉悟提高的基础上，农民们便自觉地要求行动。许多人说：“光空口说白话顶不住敌人，非实干不行！”群众们喊出了“不当亡国奴，坚决做主人”的口号。青年人提出的响亮的口号是：“当好汉，不当软蛋！”东聂村自动报名到朝鲜去志愿参战的就有八十余人；六十多妇女表示绝不拉男人的后腿；另有二十多人声明退出了一贯道。该村全村补征欠粮，两天之内全部完成。此外，各村农民自动捐献了大批慰劳品，写了不少慰问信，慰劳了光荣军属和人民解放军，壮大了抗美援朝的力量。
    从以下几方面可以看出运动的主要收获：
    首先，这一运动把所有各阶层群众都卷了进来，其广阔和深入超过了以往任何时期。城关二十一座工商业界自己办的讲座包括了各行各业从经理到店员共一千八百八十五人。农村中四区十五个村百分之四十以上的群众卷入了运动，大张义等少数村参加运动群众达到百分之八十。不但广大青壮年、妇女，甚至向来不过问国事的老年人也卷了进来，有不少并成了积极分子。不但翻身农民和知识分子积极参加，而且还有一部分过去的地主、富农和一些过去的敌伪人员参加，表现了反帝统一战线更进一步的扩大与巩固，造成了反美爱国运动的高潮。
    其次，在爱国觉悟普遍提高的基础上，农民群众中涌现了不少新的积极分子。据全县五十二个村统计：农村群众中涌现的积极分子共达一千三百八十二人，村干部积极分子三百十八人。一、四、五三个区共产党员和青年团员中的积极分子共有二百八十人。在运动中党、团威信大大提高，广大青年要求入团和参加民兵。据不完全统计，经过抗美援朝运动，四十六个村共发展民兵三百八十七人，十三个村发展青年团员九十人，因而加强了农村人民民主专政的基础。
    再次，抗美援朝运动也考验和教育了工作干部。在热火朝天的群众运动中，工作干部明确地认识了斗争方向，坚定了斗争意志。据四个区统计：原来躺倒不干、有严重思想问题的村干部，经过这个运动变得积极起来的有一百五十二人。党团员经过运动积极起来的：党员五十三人，团员九十人。许多村子的工作面貌焕然一新。例如八达、什贴、西长寿等村就从三等村变成了一等村。
    再次，运动走向高潮，反革命分子的活动减少了，谣言听不见了。在运动中群众控诉出一些反革命分子的罪恶事实，揭发了六个现行犯，政府当即予以扣押。其他有反动行为的分子，也分别受到了农民的严格批评，公开向群众表示低头。农民群众并对少数不法地主，实行管制，强迫他们在劳动中改造自己。农民群众在此时真正感到了自己是社会的主人，因而使农村的社会气象为之一新。
    最后，运动给各级党的工作人员上了一次群众路线的课，使他们真正体会到“理论一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成物质力量”的真理，因而打破了部分工作人员中，原来的以为新区群众落后，受阎匪反动宣传影响深，对我们不相信等等的错误认识。大家都感到榆次群众情绪从来没有这么高过的，甚至比一九四九年土地改革时情绪还要高；而群众对中国共产党所表示的亲近和信任也是空前的，一切工作的进行也从来没有这么顺利过。其原因主要是：１、以往一切工作只从任务出发，简单作风，行政命令，没有发动群众并加以领导，也就是说没有走群众路线。２、一九四九年虽然进行了土地改革，但群众思想发动不够。３、对反革命分子镇压不及时或没有镇压，群众对我们有意见。４、没有把具体工作任务和总的政治斗争任务结合起来进行教育。
    总的看来，榆次县的抗美援朝运动有以下几点经验：
    第一、领导机关必须亲自负责，亲自动手，并且对待这一历史性的政治任务，不应该把抗美援朝当作是一个单纯的学习运动或宣传运动，而应该当作是一个群众性的自我教育的政治思想运动，当作是从政治上思想上发动群众并推动各种工作向前发展的有力武器。榆次县的抗美援朝运动所以取得以上所述的成绩，首先是由于中共榆次县委书记曾亲自领导，并动员全体党员干部一齐去进行。
    第二、讲解时事，回忆过去，控诉敌人，对比解放前后生活和地位，是发动群众划清敌我界线，鼓舞爱国热情，树立仇美思想，激发斗争意志的主要方法。单纯的“干部讲群众听”的说教，不接触群众具体思想，不和群众切身经验和利益相连系，是不会形成群众自觉行动的。
    第三、抗美援朝运动必须和当前工作密切结合。这个工作既不能和其他工作平列起来，又不能孤立进行，而是应当把它看作是一切工作的中心环节。经验证明：反美爱国的思想教育，对生产、缴粮、纳税、冬学、土地改革、镇压反革命、取缔一贯道等工作，都是经常起作用的动力。
    第四、通过各种会议和训练班培养和训练大批积极分子作为运动的骨干，通过他们去发动群众这是使运动普遍发展的方法。在城市中可组织各行各业的讲座，发挥他们自己组织自己的作用。在农村中，根据运动发展情况，可适时地召开各种人的座谈会，培养各种人的积极分子，使他们回到群众中活动，发挥酵母的作用，这是群众自己教育自己的最好形式。
    目前榆次农村的抗美援朝运动，发展还很不平衡，以上主要是根据八十二个重点村（占全县二百零八个村的百分之四十）和城关情况写的。该县今后的任务是使运动普遍开展，务使每村每人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，在已经有了发动的村，必须继续巩固和深入，防止干部和群众的自满和“松一口气”的现象发生。反美爱国思想教育是长期的工作，要想真正巩固地树立人民群众的爱国主义思想，使之成为开展各种工作的经常起作用的动力，就必须继续把抗美援朝的教育当作一个严重政治任务去坚持进行。
