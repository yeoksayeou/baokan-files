The Trade Union of the Tianjin Railway Bureau Vehicle Factory changed its work style and concretely organized and led the movement to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Team, taking production a step forward. In February, the product quality of the factory's foundry, forging and other workshops was improved. Since March, the Machinery Section has basically eliminated the phenomenon of rework.

Before the trade union's re-election in February, the trade union did not pay attention to leading production and often ignored some requests proactively put forward by workers, thus dampening the competitive enthusiasm of the masses of workers. For example, when the city-level model team, Wang Decai Team, initiated a challenge to the Ma Hengchang Team in January and went to the trade union to discuss it, the vice chairman of the trade union said, "This stuff should be handled by the propaganda committee!" "This won't work, the trade union is being re-elected." After the re-election, the trade union changed its work style, tightened its grip on leading production, and decided to make carrying out the Ma Hengchang Team movement one of its main tasks. Lu Qinggui, the production committee member, first went deep into the workshop to help the Wang Decai Team in the Machinery Section. After three days of research, the terms of the challenge were formulated. At the same time, the trade union convened a joint meeting of workshop chairmen and production committee members, combined with ideological education against American imperialist armament of Japan, and arranged for each workshop to deliberate and discuss responding to the challenge from the Wang Decai Team. Lu Qinggui also personally went to the Foundry Section, where there were more problems, to organize team discussions. As a result, the Wang Decai Team formally challenged the Ma Hengchang Team on February 17 and posted a letter of challenge to the entire factory. The workshops responded one after another, and by the 20th, all thirty-seven teams (including one workshop unit) in the factory had joined the movement. Because the challenge was led, the conditions set by each team generally focused on the main problems in the factory's production and were relatively practical.

Afterwards, the factory's trade union, through the newspapers, accepted the lessons of some factories where the Ma Hengchang Team movement became a mere formality due to a lack of inspection. On February 28, it joined the studio, inspection office, labor and wages office and other relevant personnel to conduct inspections in each workshop. During the inspection, in addition to understanding the completion of each team according to the challenge conditions, the difficulties in the work were also consulted and recorded in detail. For example, after the Foundry Section and Vehicle Section raised issues such as inconsistent raw material composition and poor quality, some were helped to solve the problems, and some were referred to higher authorities for research and processing. This inspection greatly encouraged the workers.

The trade union workshop committees generally also attached importance to team work, and the best work was done by the Machinery Section. When the Wang Decai Team proposed to challenge the Ma Hengchang Team, some workers in some teams said, "The Ma Hengchang Team must have a lot of party members and league members, so their work is certainly good, how can we compare?" In response to these ideological situations, the workshop committee promptly convened a meeting of team leaders to explain the significance of the Ma Hengchang Team movement. At the same time, it specifically helped each team to formulate plans.

After the nine teams in the Machinery Section universally responded to the challenge, the workshop committee called on the team leaders to regularly check their work according to the conditions set, in order to consolidate everyone's enthusiasm. At the same time, it combined with propaganda and mobilization work to promptly commend the good ones. Even so, there were still a few teams that could not seriously implement the challenge conditions. After research, it was found that the main reason was that the team leader was not responsible and the team was not united. To this end, the workshop committee and the administration held a test for team leaders and deputy team leaders in early March. The questions mainly focused on how to do a good job in team work and what problems existed in the team. The team leaders generally made self-criticisms in their answers and put forward guarantees for the future. The ideological concerns of some team leaders were dispelled, thus establishing a team self-criticism meeting system, strengthening unity, and making team life begin to become active. Therefore, the production situation has improved day by day. As of the 12th of March, the entire workshop set an unprecedented record of not producing a single piece of rework.

In order to consolidate the existing achievements, the workshop committee also decided to convene a team leader meeting at least once every two weeks in the future to systematically explain and introduce the challenge conditions of the Ma Hengchang Team and the significance of this movement.

　　天津铁路局车辆工厂工会
    切实领导马恒昌小组竞赛运动
    天津铁路局车辆工厂工会改变作风，具体组织领导向马恒昌小组应战运动，把生产提高了一步。二月份，该厂铸工、锻工等车间产品质量均有改善，机器所三月份以来，已基本上消灭了反修现象。
    该厂工会二月改选以前，工会不注意领导生产，对工友主动提出的一些要求，也常置之不理，因而打击了职工群众的竞赛情绪。如全市模范小组王德才小组于一月份发起向马恒昌小组应战、找到工会去研究时，工会副主席说：“这玩艺儿得找宣传委员啊”；“这不行，工会正改选哪”；工会改选后，即改变了作风，抓紧了对生产的领导，决定将开展马恒昌小组运动作为主要工作之一。生产委员陆清桂、首先深入车间，帮助机器所王德才小组，经过三天研究，订出了应战条件。同时工会又召开车间主席和生产委员联席会，结合反对美帝国主义武装日本的思想教育，布置各车间酝酿讨论向王德才组应战。陆清桂并亲自到问题较多的铸工所，组织小组讨论。结果，王德才小组在二月十七日正式向马恒昌小组应战，并贴出对全厂的挑战书后，各车间即纷纷响应，到二十日，全厂三十七个组（包括一个车间单位）即全部投入这一运动。由于应战是有领导的，所以各组所订的条件，一般也都针对了该厂生产中的主要问题，比较切合实际。
    其后，该厂工会通过报纸，接受了有的厂因缺乏检查而使马恒昌小组运动流于形式的教训，于二月二十八日联合工作室、检工室、劳动工资室等有关人员，到各车间进行检查。检查中除根据应战条件，了解各小组完成的情形外，并详细征询记录了工作中的困难。如铸工所、车辆所提出原料成分不一、质量不好等问题后，有的即帮助解决，有的则转请上级研究处理。这一检查，在工友中起了很大的鼓舞作用。
    工会车间委员会，一般也重视了小组工作，做得最好的是机器所。该车间当王德才小组提出向马恒昌小组应战时，有的小组工友说：“人家马恒昌小组一定有好些党员、团员，干活当然好，咱怎么比？”针对这些思想情况，车间委员会及时召集各小组长开会，解释了马恒昌小组运动的意义。同时并具体帮助各组订出计划。
    机器所九个小组普遍应战后，车间委员会即号召小组长经常根据所订条件，检查工作，借以巩固大家的情绪。同时并结合宣传鼓动工作，及时表扬好的。虽然这样，却仍有少数组不能认真实行应战条件，经研究发现主要原因是组长不负责任，组内团结搞得不好。为此，车间委员会和行政上，又于三月初举行了正副小组长测验，题目主要是怎样才能搞好小组工作和组内存在什么问题。小组长在答案中一般都作了检讨，并提出今后的保证。某些组长的思想顾虑解除了，从而建立起组内的检讨会制度，加强了团结，小组生活开始活跃起来。因此，生产情况日有改进，三月份迄十二日止，全车间创了未出一件反修活的空前纪录。
    为了巩固既有成绩，车间委员会并决定今后至少每两周召开一次小组长会，有计划的讲解和介绍马恒昌小组的挑战条件及这一运动的意义。
