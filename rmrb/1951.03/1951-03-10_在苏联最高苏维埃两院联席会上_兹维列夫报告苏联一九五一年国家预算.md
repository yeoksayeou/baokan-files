　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th TASS: Soviet Finance Minister Zverev delivered a report on the Soviet Union's 1951 National Budget at the joint session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Union Chamber and National Chamber. The abstract is as follows:
　　The draft national budget now submitted to the Soviet Supreme Soviet for examination and approval is formulated in accordance with the national economic development plan for 1951, to ensure that financial resources are used to further develop the socialist economy, improve the welfare of the working people, and raise their culture.
　　The 1951 national budget and the execution of last year's budget reflect the achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin in building a communist society and strengthening the national power.
　　The Soviet working people have victoriously completed the tasks of Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan. The Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total industrial output in 1950 should increase by 48% compared to 1940. This goal has been greatly exceeded. The total industrial output in the final year of the Five-Year Plan exceeded the 1940 level by 73%. The 1950 industrial production plan was completed by 102%. Last year, total industrial output increased by 23% compared to 1949.
　　Great achievements have also been made in socialist agriculture. The total agricultural output has exceeded the pre-war level. The total grain harvest in 1950 reached 7.6 billion poods. The goal set by the Five-Year Plan for the total cotton output in 1950 has also been greatly exceeded. Satisfactory harvests have also been achieved for other industrial crops, vegetables, and potatoes.
　　Further improvement of the welfare of the Soviet people was one of the main achievements of last year. The living standards and cultural levels of the working people have been greatly improved compared to the pre-war period. This is most clearly reflected in the increase in the national income of the Soviet Union. The national income in 1950 increased by 64% compared to the 1940 level, while the Five-Year Plan stipulated only a 38% increase. Based on the increase in national income and the extensive development of trade in consumer goods for the working people (the prices of which have been continuously reduced in a planned way in recent years), the real income of the people has greatly exceeded the pre-war level.
　　The Soviet government implemented the fourth consecutive reduction in state retail prices of food and manufactured goods on March 1, 1951, once again proving Stalin's concern for the working people and for improving their welfare. As a result of this price reduction, the Soviet people will benefit by 34.5 billion rubles in one year.
　　The remarkable achievements we have made in developing our socialist economy and culture and in improving the people's welfare once again powerfully demonstrate the great organizational and leadership strength of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, and the infinite creativity of our people. Our people are now marching towards communism with confidence under the wise leadership of the great Stalin.
　　The tremendous achievements in the development of the national economy have promoted the further consolidation of currency and various credit relations in the national economy. One of the most important signs of the stability of Soviet finance is the increase in state budget revenue based on the accumulation of the socialist economy. During the post-war Five-Year Plan, the income of the national budget increased from 300.2 billion rubles in 1945 to 422.1 billion rubles in 1950. During the same period, the expenditure of the Soviet national budget increased from 298.6 billion rubles in 1945 to 412.7 billion rubles in 1950. In each year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, as in previous years, the execution of the annual budget showed a considerable surplus of revenue over expenditure. Expenditures in the national budget for developing the national economy increased from 74.4 billion rubles in 1945 to 157.3 billion rubles in 1950. The total for the five-year period was 708.1 billion rubles. These funds were used to restore and build thousands of new state-owned enterprises, to build or repair millions of square meters of living space, to implement the great plan for transforming nature, and to vigorously develop productive forces.
　　In the past five years, the state spent 524.5 billion rubles on various social and cultural measures, of which 258.9 billion rubles were spent on national education, 94.4 billion rubles on health care, and 102 billion rubles on social welfare. In the 1950 budget, the total expenditure on social and cultural facilities was 116.8 billion rubles, an increase of 86.3% compared to 1945. These figures most vividly demonstrate the extreme attention and care of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin for the development of socialist culture.
　　The Soviet state's remarkable achievements in the development of the national economy and the further consolidation of finance vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic system over the dying capitalist system.
　　The economic situation and finances of capitalist countries are deteriorating and becoming more acute due to the imperialist policy of aggression.
　　Comrade Stalin's conversation with a reporter from Pravda exposed the organizers of preparations for another world war. Comrade Stalin said: "... in the United States, Britain, and France, there are aggressive forces eager for a new war. They need war in order to obtain excess profits, in order to plunder other countries. These are the wealthy who have millions and billions of dollars, who believe that war is a profitable business that generates huge profits." These aggressive forces are openly preparing for a third world war. They have already launched a bloody war in Korea, which is still ongoing. They are piecing together armies and establishing bridgeheads for attacking the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.
　　The imperialists' evil and plundering policies (followed by a frenzied arms race) have aroused the unparalleled hatred of peace-loving people around the world. The American leaders, by preparing for a new world war, are carrying out the will of their masters – the monopoly capitalists. Lenin said that these monopoly capitalists "extract their billions in pure gold from the terrible suffering of the masses, from the blood of the proletariat."
　　The arms race is extremely profitable for the imperialists, but it is followed by the complete turning of the entire economy onto a war footing, the reduction of the production of means of subsistence, and the further impoverishment of the working masses. As a result of rising prices, greater inflation, and increased taxes, the real wages of the working class in the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries are falling sharply.
　　The American imperialists are intensifying pressure on the governments of Marshallized countries, which, following their masters' lead, are also turning industrial production onto a war footing, reducing civilian production, expanding their armies, and increasing military budgets. All of this fundamentally shakes the economies and finances of the various capitalist aggressor countries.
　　The situation is completely different in the People's Democratic countries, which are advancing along the road of socialist construction. Thanks to the labor enthusiasm of the people and the constant help of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries have made great achievements in building socialist economies and consolidating finances. The national budgets of the People's Democratic countries are constantly increasing, and their execution shows revenue exceeding expenditure. On the basis of the upsurge in the national economy, the purchasing power of currency has increased, and the welfare of the workers in the People's Democratic countries has increased.
　　The People's Republic of China has made remarkable achievements in developing its economy and finance. Thorough democratic reforms have laid a solid foundation for achieving new successes in prospering the economy and raising the material and cultural levels of the Chinese working people.
　　The German Democratic Republic is also confidently embarking on the road of democratic reform.
　　The great achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in the prosperity of their national economies and the consolidation of their financial finances demonstrate that the people of the democratic countries, headed by the Soviet Union, are confidently marching towards a bright and brilliant future, thereby increasing the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world.
　　The completion of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan has laid a solid foundation for achieving new achievements in realizing Stalin's brilliant plan to build communism in the Soviet Union.
　　The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have stipulated enormous tasks for 1951 in order to further develop the Soviet Union's national economy. Fully utilizing all economic resources can ensure the further powerful upsurge of all sectors of the national economy, greatly exceeding the 1950 production level.
　　The amount of investment in basic construction in industry and other sectors of the national economy has increased this year. The work of the great communist construction projects is underway.
　　The total revenue of the 1951 national budget presented here is 457.992 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 451.503 billion rubles, leaving a surplus of 6.489 billion rubles. Compared with the 1950 budget, this year's revenue increased by 8.5%, and expenditure increased by 9.4%. The substantial increase in the budget, in the context of the reduction in retail prices of food and manufactured goods implemented on March 1, 1951, reflects the further strengthening of the Soviet state's economic power.
　　The increase in the revenue of the 1951 national budget is mainly due to greater revenue from the socialist economy, based on further expanding production and reducing production costs. Revenue from sales tax in the budget is stipulated as 244 billion rubles. The profits tax paid by enterprises and economic organizations is stipulated as 47 billion rubles.
　　In contrast to the situation in capitalist countries, where tax revenue accounts for the vast majority of all budget revenue, in the Soviet Union's national budget, the amount of taxes paid by the people is negligible, accounting for only 9.4% of the total.
　　Financial funds will be used to increase the basic and circulating funds of socialist enterprises, to implement the great plan for social and cultural construction, and to further strengthen the defense capabilities of the Soviet homeland.
　　As in previous years, allocations for the national economy are the most important expenditure item in the Soviet budget. In 1951, this allocation is stipulated as 178.5 billion rubles, equal to 39.5% of the budget expenditure. A large proportion of the expenses for the national economy will be used for new basic construction.
　　The brilliant Stalin plan to establish a material base for communism requires us to further increase basic construction investment and use this investment more effectively: the basic construction investment costs in 1951, calculated according to the prices reduced on July 1, 1950, are 132 billion rubles, including circulating funds; of this amount, 98 billion rubles will be allocated from the budget, and 34 billion rubles will be raised by the various sectors of the national economy themselves. In 1951, the allocations for agriculture and forestry will reach 39 billion rubles, 4.8 billion rubles more than in 1950. The national budget guarantees the supply of funds for further increasing the degree of agricultural mechanization and improving the efficiency of farm work.
　　Large sums have been allocated to agriculture this year to implement the Stalin plan to transform nature and the three-year plan to develop collectively owned livestock breeding on collective farms and state farms. In 1951, collective farms will build a large number of public buildings for production, cultural institutions, and service agencies. In our country, concern for raising the living and cultural standards of the working people is the state's primary task. Comrade Stalin said at the 18th Party Congress: "We want to transform all workers and all peasants into cultured and knowledgeable people, and we will achieve this in a little while." This instruction of Comrade Stalin is being victoriously fulfilled.
　　The number of students in educational institutions is constantly increasing, and millions of people are receiving production training, which is proof of the realization of Comrade Stalin's instructions. By the end of last year, 37 million people were attending primary schools, seven-year schools, secondary schools, technical schools, and other secondary education institutions. In 1950, there were 1.247 million students in higher education institutions (including correspondence schools). The number of students increased by 115,000 compared to 1949. Tens of millions of working people in cities and villages, without hindering production, attended various schools and training courses, learned new skills, and improved their own technology.
　　The Soviet national budget guarantees the expenses of the cultural construction plan, which is expanding year by year. In 1951, the funds used for social and cultural undertakings will reach 120.8 billion rubles, accounting for 26.8% of the total national budget expenditure.
　　In the total expenditure for social and cultural undertakings, 59 billion rubles are used for education, 21.9 billion rubles for health and sports, 22.3 billion rubles for social support, and 4.1 billion rubles for state subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers. These funds can guarantee the further development of the network of schools, technical schools, higher education institutions, medical science institutions, kindergartens and nurseries, sanatoriums and rest homes, etc. The 1951 social insurance budget is set at 21.1 billion rubles.
　　From the 1951 budget, it can be seen that the Party and the government, as in previous years, are particularly concerned about the further development of our country's science. The state allocated 8 billion rubles for the development of science in 1951.
　　The situation in capitalist countries is completely different. Capitalist countries use huge amounts of funds for military purposes, while the funds allocated for cultural purposes are negligible. For example, the United States' education expenditure in 1950-1951 accounted for only 1% of the national budget, and even these negligible allocations were later reduced by the US government. In the upcoming 1951-1952 fiscal year, the living conditions of the American people will further deteriorate, and education and health expenditure will be reduced again.
　　While carrying out great economic, organizational, cultural and educational work, the Soviet government also constantly cares about consolidating the defense capabilities of our socialist homeland. Our socialist homeland is leading the working people of all countries in a just struggle for lasting peace and international cooperation.
　　Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people, said to a reporter from Pravda: "As for the Soviet Union, it will continue to unswervingly pursue a policy of preventing war and maintaining peace in the future." Stalin's wise Soviet state's foreign policy aimed at defending peace is unanimously supported by the entire Soviet people and warmly embraced by millions of working people in other countries.
　　Opposed to the peace camp is the imperialist camp headed by the reactionary ruling clique in the United States. This reactionary American ruling clique is trying to ignite the flames of another world war. The imperialist countries are tensely preparing for a new bloody slaughter and are therefore drastically increasing their military expenditures.
　　According to Truman's message to Congress, the US budget for the 1951-52 fiscal year stipulates that more than 50 billion US dollars will be used for military purposes. This number is almost fifty times larger than the US pre-war military expenditure in the 1938-39 fiscal year and about twice the military expenditure in the 1941-42 fiscal year.
　　As everyone knows, the American warmongers have caused other capitalist countries, first of all Britain and France, to increase huge military budgets. The direct military expenditures of Britain and France in this fiscal year are more than double those of the previous fiscal year.
　　The Soviet Union, together with all peace-loving people in the world, is waging a resolute struggle to prevent another world war and is exposing the bloody conspiracies of the American imperialists.
　　At the same time, the Soviet Union is vigilantly defending its borders and taking measures to consolidate the defense of the socialist country. In the 1951 national budget submitted for consideration, the cost of maintaining the Soviet armed forces is 96.4 billion rubles.
　　The funds used for national defense account for 21.3% of the total expenditure of the Soviet national budget, while in the pre-war year of 1940, this expenditure accounted for 32.5% of the total budget expenditure. The vast majority of the Soviet budget expenditure, as pointed out above, is used for the development of the national economy and social and cultural facilities.
　　The 1951 Soviet national budget, submitted for approval by the Supreme Soviet, guarantees the necessary funds for the new development of the socialist economy, further improves the material and cultural standards of the working people, and consolidates the defense capabilities of the Soviet state.
　　Due to the great organizational work of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and due to the creative labor of the Soviet people, the production volume of our country's industry and agriculture is increasing at an unprecedented rate. On this basis, the revenue of the national budget has also increased accordingly.
　　The tremendous achievements in the development of the national economy in the years of the implementation of Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan have encouraged the Soviet people to work more persistently to discover and mobilize domestic resources to complete and over fulfill various national plans. The implementation of the national budget will further develop productive forces and make the culture of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union blossom beautifully.
　　There is no doubt that in 1951, the Soviet people, united around their vanguard – the Bolshevik Party, will achieve great new achievements in economic and cultural development and in strengthening the strength of the motherland, which is confidently marching towards communism under the leadership of the great leader and teacher Stalin.

　　在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会上
    兹维列夫报告苏联一九五一年国家预算
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：苏联财政部长兹维列夫在苏联最高苏维埃联盟院与民族院联席会议上发表关于苏联一九五一年国家预算的报告，摘要如下：
    现在提交苏联最高苏维埃审议批准的国家预算草案是依照一九五一年发展国民经济的国家计划拟定的，借以保证财政资源用来进一步发展社会主义经济、增进劳动人民的福利和提高他们的文化。
    一九五一年国家预算以及去年预算执行的情形反映了苏联人民在列宁和斯大林党的领导下，在建设共产主义社会和加强祖国国力方面所获得的成就。
    苏联劳动人民已经胜利地完成了斯大林战后五年计划的任务。五年计划规定一九五○年的工业总产量应较一九四○年增加百分之四十八。这一目标已大大地超过了。五年计划最后一年工业总产量超过一九四○年水平的百分之七十三。一九五○年工业生产计划已以百分之一○二完成。去年工业总产量较一九四九年增加百分之二十三。
    社会主义农业方面也获得了巨大的成就。农业总产量已超过战前水平。一九五○年谷物总收获量达七十六亿普特。五年计划所规定的一九五○年棉花总产量的目标也大大地超过了。其他工业作物、蔬菜和马铃薯等也得到了令人满意的丰收。
    苏联人民福利的进一步改善是去年的主要成就之一。劳动人民的生活水平和文化水平已较战前时期大大地提高了，这一点在苏联国民收入的提高中反映得最为明显。一九五○年的国民收入较一九四○年的水平增加了百分之六十四，而五年计划所规定的只是增加百分之三十八。基于国民收入的增加，基于劳动人民消费品贸易（其价格近年来已有计划地不断减低）的广泛发展，人民的实际收入已大大地超过了战前水平。
    苏联政府在一九五一年三月一日实行了连续的第四次减低食品及制成品的国家零售价格，再度证明了斯大林对劳动人民、对改善劳动人民福利的关怀。由于这次减低物价的结果，苏联人民在一年中将获益三百四十五亿卢布。
    我们在发展我们社会主义经济和文化以及增进人民福利方面所获得的卓越成就，再度有力地显示了布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府的伟大的组织和领导的力量以及我国人民无穷无尽的创造力。我国人民现在正在伟大斯大林的英明领导下满怀信心地向着共产主义迈进。
    在国民经济发展中所获得的巨大成就已促进了货币及国民经济中各种信用关系的进一步巩固。苏联财政稳定的最重要征象之一，是国家预算中基于社会主义经济积累的收入的增加。在战后五年计划期间，国家预算的收入从一九四五年的三千零二十亿卢布增加到一九五○年的四千二百二十一亿卢布。在同一时期中，苏联国家预算的支出从一九四五年的二千九百八十六亿卢布增加到一九五○年的四千一百二十七亿卢布。在战后五年计划的每一年中，也像以往的年代一样，每年预算的执行情况除了支出之外，收入尚有相当的盈余。发展国民经济国家预算的开支，从一九四五年的七百四十四亿卢布增加到一九五○年的一千五百七十三亿卢布。五年期间的总数是七千零八十一亿卢布。这些款项用来恢复和建设成千新的国营企业，用来建筑或修复成千百万平方公尺的居住面积。用来实现伟大的改造自然计划，用来大力发展生产力。
    在过去五年期间，国家在各种社会和文化的措施上用了五千二百四十五亿卢布，其中用在国民教育方面为二千五百八十九亿卢布，用在卫生事业方面为九百四十四亿卢布，用在社会福利方面为一千零二十亿卢布。在一九五○年的预算中，社会和文化设施方面的开支总数为一千一百六十八亿卢布，比一九四五年增加了百分之八十六点三。这些数字，最生动地证明了共产党、苏联政府以及斯大林同志对于发展社会主义文化的极度注意和关怀。
    苏维埃国家在国民经济发展方面的显著成就以及财政的进一步巩固，生动地显示了社会主义经济制度对垂死的资本主义制度的优越性。
    资本主义国家的经济情况和财政正在日趋恶化，并且因为帝国主义的侵略政策而变得更为剧烈了。
    斯大林同志对真理报记者的谈话揭露了另一次世界大战准备工作的组织者。斯大林同志说：“……在美国、英国以及法国，有着侵略的势力渴望新的战争。他们需要战争以便获得超额的利润，以便劫掠其他国家，这些人就是那些财产以百万和亿万计的豪富们，他们认为战争是产生巨大利润的有利可图的事情。”这些侵略势力正公开准备第三次世界大战。他们已经在朝鲜发动了血腥的战争，并且还正在进行着。他们正拼凑着军队及建立进攻苏联与人民民主国家的桥头阵地。
    帝国主义者的罪恶的掠夺政策（随之而来的是疯狂的军备竞赛）激起了全世界爱好和平人民的无比的憎恨。美国的头目们，由于准备新的世界大战，便执行着他们的主子——垄断资本家的意志。列宁说这些垄断资本家“从大众的可怕的苦难中，从无产阶级的鲜血中，榨取自己的亿万利润的纯金”。
    军备竞赛对于帝国主义者来说是极其有利可图的事情，但随之而来的却是全部经济的转上战争轨道、生活资料生产的减缩与劳动大众的进一步贫穷。由于物价上升、通货更加膨胀与赋税加重的结果，美国、英国及其他资本主义国家的工人阶级的实际工资正在剧烈地下降着。
    美帝国主义者正对马歇尔化国家的政府加紧施用压力，这些政府跟着自己的主子亦步亦趋，也正在把工业生产转上战争轨道，削减民用生产，扩充军队与增加军事预算。所有这一切都从根本上动摇着各资本主义侵略国的经济与财政。
    在沿着社会主义建设的道路上前进的人民民主国家里，情况便完全不同了。由于人民大众的劳动热情以及苏联的经常帮助，人民民主国家在建设社会主义经济与巩固财政方面获得了巨大的成就。人民民主国家的国家预算不断地增大，而且执行起来收入超过支出。在国民经济的高涨的基础上，货币的购买力提高了，人民民主国家劳动者的福利增加了。
    中华人民共和国在发展经济与财政方面已获得显著的成就。彻底的民主改革为繁荣经济与提高中国劳动人民的物质与文化水平达到新的成就奠定了坚实的基础。
    德意志民主共和国也满怀信心地走上民主改革的道路。
    苏联与各人民民主国家的国民经济的繁荣以及金融财政的巩固等方面所获得的伟大成绩，证明了以苏联为首的民主国家的人民满怀信心地迈向光明灿烂的将来，从而也就增加了全世界的和平与民主的力量。
    苏联战后五年计划的完成为实现斯大林所规定的在苏联建设共产主义的辉煌计划奠定了新成就的稳固基础。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府规定了一九五一年的巨大任务，以便进一步发展苏联的国民经济。充分地利用经济上所有的资源就可以保证国民经济各部门的进一步强有力的高涨，并大大超过一九五○年的生产水平。
    工业和国民经济的其他部门的基本建设投资量本年度有了增加。巨大的共产主义建设工程的工作正在开展。
    这里提出的一九五一年国家预算的总收入为四千五百七十九亿九千二百万卢布，支出为四千五百一十五亿零三百万卢布；收支相抵尚余六十四亿八千九百万卢布。如与一九五○年的预算比较，本年的收入增加了百分之八点五，支出增加了百分之九点四。在一九五一年三月一日起实行的减低食品和制成品零售价格的情况下，预算的大量增加反映出苏维埃国家经济力量的进一步加强。
    一九五一年国家预算收入的增加主要是由于在进一步扩大生产和减低生产成本的基础上，从社会主义经济方面获得更大的收入。预算中的营业税收入规定为二千四百四十亿卢布。由各企业和经济组织所缴纳的利得税规定为四百七十亿卢布。
    与资本主义国家的税收成为所有预算收入中的绝大部分的情况相反，在苏联的国家预算中，人民纳税的数目微不足道，仅占总数的百分之九点四。
    财政上的资金将用于增加社会主义企业的基本资金和流动资金，以实现社会和文化建设的巨大计划并进一步加强苏维埃祖国的国防力量。
    正如往年一样，用于国民经济的拨款是苏联预算中最重要的支出项目。在一九五一年，这项拨款规定为一千七百八十五亿卢布，等于预算支出的百分之三十九点五。用于国民经济的一大部分费用将用于新的基本建设方面。
    为共产主义建立物质基础的辉煌的斯大林计划需要我们进一步增加基本建设投资并更有效地使用这种投资：一九五一年的基本建设投资费用，按照一九五○年七月一日减低过的价格计算为一千三百二十亿卢布，其中包括流动资金；在这笔款项中，九百八十亿卢布将由预算中拨出，三百四十亿卢布由国民经济各部门自行筹措。在一九五一年中，用于农业和林业的拨款将达三百九十亿卢布，比一九五○年多四十八亿卢布。国家预算保证供给用于进一步增加农业机械化的程度和提高农场工作效率的款项。
    今年已给农业拨发大笔款项，借以实现斯大林改造自然计划和发展集体农场和国家农场的公有牲畜饲养的三年计划。在一九五一年中，集体农场将建造大量公共的供生产用的以及文化机关和服务机关的房舍。在我们国家里，关心提高劳动人民的生活和文化水平是国家的首要任务。斯大林同志在第十八次党代表大会上说过：“我们想把所有的工人和所有的农民都变成为文化的有学识的人，而且我们再过一些时候，就会做到这一步的。”斯大林同志的这个指示正被胜利地完成着。
    教育机关里的学生的数目正在不断增加中，数以百万计的人正在受生产的训练，这就是实现斯大林同志的指示的证明。到去年年底为止，已有三千七百万人在初等学校、七年制学校、中等学校、技术学校以及其他中等教育机关里上学。在一九五○年中，高等教育机关（包括函授学校）有一百二十四万七千学生。学生的数目比一九四九年增加了十一万五千人。城市和乡村里的数以千万计的劳动人民，在不妨碍生产的条件下，进了各种学校和训练班，学得新的才能并提高了自己的技术。
    苏联的国家预算保证供给一年比一年扩大的文化建设计划的费用。在一九五一年中用于社会和文化事业的款项将达一千二百零八亿卢布，占整个国家预算经费的百分之二十六点八。
    在社会与文化事业的总经费中，用于教育方面的有五百九十亿卢布，用于卫生与体育方面的有二百一十九亿卢布，用于社会赡养方面的有二百二十三亿卢布，用于子女众多的母亲与单身母亲的国家津贴方面的有四十一亿卢布。这些款项可以保证学校、技术学校、高等教育机关、医药科学机关、幼稚园与托儿所、疗养院与休养所等机构网获得进一步的发展。一九五一年的社会保险预算定为二百一十一亿卢布。
    从一九五一年的预算中，可以看出党与政府也像往年一样，对于我国科学的进一步发展特别关心。国家指拨八十亿卢布作为一九五一年发展科学之用。
    资本主义国家的情形完全不同。资本主义各国都以巨额经费用于军事方面，而拨作文化用途的款项却微不足道。例如美国一九五○——一九五一年的教育经费仅占国家预算的百分之一，就是这些微不足道的拨款以后也被美国政府削减。在即将到来的一九五一——一九五二会计年度中，美国人民的生活条件将更形恶化，教育与卫生的经费将再被削减。
    苏联政府进行伟大的经济、组织、文化与教育方面的工作，同时也经常关心于巩固我们社会主义祖国的国防力量。我们的社会主义祖国正在领导着各国劳动人民为争取持久和平与国际合作而进行正义的斗争。
    劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志对真理报记者说：“至于苏联，它在将来也将继续坚持不渝地奉行防止战争和维护和平的政策”。以保卫和平为目的的斯大林的英明的苏维埃国家的外交政策受到苏联全体人民的一致支持，并受到其他各国千百万劳动人民的热烈拥护。
    与和平阵营对立的是以反动的美国统治集团为首的帝国主义阵营。这个反动的美国统治集团正竭力煽起另一次世界大战的战火。各帝国主义国家正在紧张地准备新的血腥屠杀，因此在急剧地增加它们的军事费用。
    据杜鲁门致国会咨文指出：美国一九五一——五二会计年度的预算规定作军事用途的款项达五百亿美元以上。这个数目几乎比美国战前一九三八——三九会计年度的军事费用大五十倍，约为一九四一——四二会计年度的军费的二倍。
    大家知道，美国战争贩子已使其他资本主义国家，首先是英国和法国，增加了钜额的军事预算。英国和法国本会计年度的直接军事费用比前一会计年度增加了一倍以上。
    苏联与全世界一切爱好和平的人民一道在进行着防止另一次世界大战的坚决斗争，并揭露美帝国主义者的血腥阴谋。
    同时，苏联也警惕地保卫着它的边疆，并采取措施巩固社会主义国家的防务。在提交会议考虑的一九五一年国家预算中，维持苏联武装部队的费用为九百六十四亿卢布。
    用作国家防务的款项占苏联国家预算全部支出的百分之二十一点三，而在战前一九四○年此项费用占预算总支出的百分之三十二点五。苏联预算的绝大部分开支，正如上面所指出的，都是用在发展国民经济与社会和文化的设施上。
    提交最高苏维埃批准的一九五一年的苏联国家预算，保证以必要的款项来进行社会主义经济的新发展，进一步提高劳动人民的物质与文化水平。并巩固苏维埃国家的国防力量。
    由于列宁和斯大林党的巨大的组织工作，由于苏联人民的创造性的劳动，我国工业和农业的生产量正以前所未有的速度增加着。在这个基础上，国家预算的收入也随而增加了。
    在实施斯大林战后五年计划的几年中，国民经济发展上所获得的巨大成就鼓舞着苏联人民为发掘和动员国内的资源以完成和超额完成国家各种计划而更为坚持不渝地工作。国家预算的实行将使生产力得到进一步的发展，使苏联各族人民的文化开放美丽的花朵。
    毫无疑问，在一九五一年，团结在他们的先锋队——布尔什维克党的周围的苏联人民，将在经济和文化的发展上、在加强正在伟大的领袖和导师斯大林的领导下满怀信心地迈向共产主义的祖国的力量上，获得巨大的新的成就。
