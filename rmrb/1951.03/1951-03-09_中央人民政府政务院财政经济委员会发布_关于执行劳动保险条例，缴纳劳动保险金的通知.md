A. Enterprises that have already paid two months' labor insurance general fund do not need to pay the March and April labor insurance general fund again.

(5) Labor insurance funds shall be paid by the respective enterprise units implementing labor insurance. For postal and telecommunications, railways, and other enterprises that can have their funds uniformly allocated and paid by higher-level organs, the general fund for March and April can be uniformly paid to the local People's Bank of China by their higher-level organs.

(6) When paying labor insurance funds, each enterprise shall fill out a four-part labor insurance fund payment form, which shall be signed and sealed by the person in charge of the enterprise and submitted to the local People's Bank of China along with the payment.
