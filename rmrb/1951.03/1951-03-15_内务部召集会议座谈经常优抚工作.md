The Ministry of Internal Affairs convened a national symposium on preferential treatment work from February 23rd to 26th to strengthen preferential treatment work and implement the five preferential treatment regulations promulgated on December 11, 1950. The meeting believed that since the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the patriotic ideology of the people across the country has been unprecedentedly elevated, which is a favorable condition for doing a good job in preferential treatment work. The meeting also proposed the policy of actively organizing and utilizing social forces to carry out regular preferential treatment work.

The symposium criticized the erroneous ideas of not attaching importance to preferential treatment work, thinking that "preferential treatment work is nothing," and relying solely on government pensions without mobilizing the masses. The meeting also exchanged work experiences on the system of mutual assistance in agricultural labor for farming on behalf of others in rural areas, and the employment and production of family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in urban areas.

　　内务部召集会议座谈经常优抚工作
    中央人民政府内务部为加强优抚工作，贯彻一九五○年十二月十一日颁布的五个优抚条例，于二月二十三日至二十六日召开了全国优抚工作座谈会。会议认为，自抗美援朝运动以来，全国人民爱国主义思想已空前提高，这是做好优抚工作的有利条件。会议并提出了主动地组织并发挥社会力量来进行经常的优抚工作的方针。
    座谈会中批判了不重视优抚工作，认为“优抚工作没有啥”以及单纯依靠政府抚恤不发动群众的错误思想；并对农村劳力互助的代耕制度，城市革命烈士家属、革命军人家属及革命残废军人的就业生产问题交换了工作经验。
