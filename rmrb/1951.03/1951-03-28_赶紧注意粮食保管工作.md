　　Quickly Pay Attention to Grain Storage Work

　　Currently, there are some serious problems in the storage of public grain that urgently need attention and resolution. According to reports from various regions, the public grain collected in the autumn of 1950 was paid by the masses before it was fully dried, due to some areas being eager to complete their tasks. The moisture content generally exceeded the safe standard of 14 percent, reaching 16 to 18 percent, with some public grain collected in Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu having moisture content as high as 22 percent. In some places, after the public grain was stored, phenomena such as heating, mildew, insect infestation, and germination occurred. The Central South region was particularly severe, with insect infestations in Jiangxi public grain once affecting warehouses in 75 counties of the province. Similar situations also existed in East China, Southwest China, North China, and other places. In addition, warehouse facilities in various places are generally simple, and with the sabotage plots of bandits and secret agents, public grain has suffered some losses. Now is the season when it is warm and rainy, and grain is extremely susceptible to mildew. If measures are not taken quickly, it will inevitably cause more serious losses.

　　In this situation, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council requires financial and grain departments in various places to earnestly do a good job in storing grain, so that public grain can be protected from or suffer less loss. This is entirely necessary.

　　Undoubtedly, the work of storing grain is a heavy task. At present, there are indeed some objective difficulties. However, our task is to overcome these difficulties and protect the grain well. Based on past experience and the current situation, we have the conditions to do a relatively good job in grain storage. There are two keys to doing this work well:

　　First, we must seriously value grain storage work. Obviously, there are two situations in grain storage work. One situation is: in some places, as mentioned above, grain has heated, become moldy, and so on, so the grain has suffered great losses. However, on the other hand, many places have stored public grain very well. For example, the Shijiazhuang District warehouse in Hebei Province conducted three general inspections of grain in 1950, and during the rainy season, it turned, dried, dispersed, and processed more than 10 million catties of public grain that was not conducive to storage, creating many effective methods for protecting grain, so that 13 million catties of grain did not suffer mildew or insect pests. Another example is a warehouse in Dayong County, Hunan Province, which stored more than 2 million catties of grain in the entire warehouse without suffering any losses. Why have these two opposite situations occurred? This is certainly related to experience in grain storage, manpower, and warehouse facilities, but the primary key is ideological. Some local governments and financial and grain departments only emphasize collection and do not pay attention to storage. They regard the storage of public grain as a simple and unimportant task. Therefore, after collection, they no longer care about storage, as if everything is fine after collection. Some financial and grain work cadres in some places are not content with grain work, believing that "grain work has no future" and "is not serving the people"; or they think that storage work is too difficult, there is no way to do it, and they have no confidence. These three ideas are of course wrong. The error of the first idea is that they do not realize that the end of the public grain collection work is only the beginning of the storage work; if the public grain storage work is not done well, it will cause serious losses to the country and the people, because public grain is one of the two major sources of national revenue today, and it is an extremely important material force for consolidating national defense, stabilizing the market, and supporting various constructions. Therefore, the work of storing public grain is a serious political task, and indifference to the storage of public grain is an act that harms national interests. The error of the second idea is that they are not content with grain storage work. They do not know that storing grain is an important way to serve the people and is a very promising job. It is wrong to leave such an important and concrete job and pursue empty, abstract so-called "future" ideas. The error of the third idea is fear of difficulties. They do not realize that all revolutionary work is difficult. The question is whether we can face up to and overcome these difficulties. If we can face up to the difficulties and try to overcome them, we can prevent or reduce the degree of difficulty. Fear of difficulties is a manifestation of a lack of revolutionary spirit. Only by thoroughly understanding these three ideological problems can there be a fundamental change in grain storage work.

　　The second key is that grain storage work must be good at relying on the masses. Many of our grain work cadres have no experience or insufficient experience in storing grain. This difficulty is even more obvious in newly liberated areas. Although the situation is better in old liberated areas, there are still many difficulties. And many people among the masses have specialized scientific knowledge and rich experience. They either have research on the prevention and control of insect pests, or they have methods for testing grain, or they have experience in grain storage equipment, etc. As long as we humbly learn from them, we will get a lot of help. Some places have gained a lot of experience by being good at learning from the masses, which has made the storage work very effective. Not only that, as long as we rely on the masses, we can also get support from the masses. Our manpower for storing grain is very insufficient. In some places, one cadre has to manage five or six warehouses. Because of this, we must rely more on the masses. Many facts have proved that those who are good at relying on the masses have overcome many difficulties. For example, in some places, the masses voluntarily signed up to help the warehouse turn and dry the grain; some masses took the initiative to study storage work with the warehouse staff, and did ventilation work in time regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy; especially many masses in many places voluntarily participated in grain protection organizations, standing guard day and night, guarding the public grain as if it were their own property, and fighting against theft, fire, and secret agents and bandits. All of this has given significant support to local grain work.

　　In short, as long as we value grain storage work and establish a policy of relying on the masses to overcome difficulties, it is possible to do a good job in grain storage. I hope that all localities will pay serious attention to it.

### 赶紧注意粮食保管工作

　　赶紧注意粮食保管工作
    目前公粮保管的情况有一些严重的问题亟需注意解决。据各地报告，一九五○年秋征公粮，由于部分地区急于完成任务，群众未及晒干即行缴纳，所含水份一般均超过百分之十四的安全标准，达到百分之十六至十八，浙江、苏南所收公粮的含水份，有高达百分之二十二的。某些地方公粮入库后发生发热、霉变、生虫、生芽等现象。其中尤以中南区较为严重，如江西公粮虫害曾一度波及该省七十五个县的仓库。其他如华东、西南、华北等地亦有类似情况。加以各地仓库设备普遍简陋，及土匪特务的阴谋破坏，公粮已遭受到某些损失。目前又到了春暖雨多，粮食极易霉坏的季节，如果再不迅速设法，必致造成更严重的损失。
    在这种情况下，政务院财政经济委员会要求各地财政、粮食部门切实做好保管粮食工作，使公粮免受或少受损失，这是完全必要的。
    毫无疑问，保管粮食的工作，是一件繁重的工作。目前在客观上的确也存在一些困难。但是，我们的任务，就在于克服这些困难，把粮食保护好。根据过去的经验和现在的情况，我们是有条件把保管粮食工作作得比较好的。作好这一工作的关键有二：
    第一，必须认真重视粮食保管工作。很显然，在粮食保管工作上，是存在着两种情况的。一种情况是：有些地方，如上所述，发生了粮食发热、霉坏等情形，因此，粮食曾经受很大损失。但是，另一方面，也有许多地方的公粮却保管得很好。例如河北省石家庄区库，在一九五○年曾进行过三次粮食普遍大检查，在雨季曾翻晒、疏散与处理了一千余万斤不利保管的公粮，创造了不少保粮有效办法，使一千三百万斤粮食未发生霉坏、虫害。又如湖南省大庸县一个仓库，全库保管二百多万斤粮，未受一点损失。为什么会发生了这样两种相反的情况呢？此中，固然与保管粮食的经验、力量和仓库的设备等有关，但首要关键，还是思想问题。有些地方的政府和财粮部门只重征收不重保管，他们把保管公粮看作是简单的、不关重要的工作，因而在征收之后，不再过问保管，似乎征收之后即万事大吉了。有些地方的财政粮食工作干部则不安心于粮食工作，认为“粮食工作没有前途”，“不是为人民服务”；或者认为保管工作太困难，没有办法，无信心。这三种思想当然都是错误的。第一种思想的错误，在于他们没有认识到公粮征收工作的结束，不过才是保管工作的开始；如果公粮保管工作做不好，就会造成国家和人民的严重损失，因为公粮是今天国家两大财源之一，是巩固国防、稳定市场及支持各种建设的一个极重要物质力量。因此，保管公粮工作乃是一个严肃的政治任务，对公粮保管漠不关心乃是一种损害国家利益的行为。第二种思想之错误，在于不安心粮食保管工作。他们不知道，保管粮食是为人民服务的重要工作的一种，是很有前途的工作。离开了这样重要具体工作，而追求空洞的、抽象的所谓“前途”的想法，是错误的。第三种思想的错误，在于害怕困难。他们没有认识到一切革命工作都是有困难的。问题在于是否能正视与克服这些困难。如果能正视困难，并设法克服这些困难，就可以防止或者减轻困难的程度。害怕困难，是缺乏革命精神的表现。只有彻底搞通了这三个思想问题，粮食保管工作才能有根本的转变。
    第二个关键，就是粮食保管工作必须善于依靠群众。我们许多粮食工作干部对保管粮食没有经验或者经验不足。特别是在新解放地区，这种困难更为明显。在老解放区，情况虽然较好，但困难仍然很多。而群众中有许多人有专门科学知识和丰富经验，他们或者对于防治虫害有研究，或者对于检验粮食有办法，或者对于粮库设备有经验等等，只要虚心向他们学习，我们就会得到许多帮助。有些地方正由于能善于向群众学习，得到了很多经验，使保管工作收到很大成效。不仅如此，只要依靠群众，还可从群众中取得支援。我们保管粮食的人力是很不够的。有些地方甚至于一个干部要管五、六个仓库。正由于这样，我们更要依靠群众。不少的事实已经证明，凡是善于依靠群众的人，都克服了许多困难。例如某些地方，群众自动报名要求帮助仓库进行粮食翻晒；有些群众主动与仓库人员研究保管工作，不论晴雨都及时进行通风工作等；特别是有许多地方的群众，自动参加护粮组织，日夜站岗放哨，把公粮看成自己的财产一样，进行防盗、防火以及与特务土匪进行斗争等。所有这些，都给予地方粮食工作以重大的支持。
    总之，只要重视粮食保管工作，并确立依靠群众克服困难的方针，做好粮食保管工作就是可能的。希望各地认真加以注意。
