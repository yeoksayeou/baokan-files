　　To support the struggle of metallurgical and machine manufacturing workers
    Four million industrial workers across Italy hold a fifteen-minute general strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 24th] According to TASS, four million industrial workers across Italy held a fifteen-minute general strike on the 21st, at the call of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, to support the metallurgical and machine manufacturing workers who have been persisting in their struggle against layoffs and factory closures. During the workers' strike, all enterprises across the country, except for public utilities, ceased work. At the same time, industrial centers throughout Italy launched a fundraising campaign, with workers donating one and a half hours of wages to help their brothers who are engaged in arduous struggle.
    Note: Italian metallurgical and machine workers began their struggle in late August of last year to oppose the Gasperi government's policy of reducing production and laying off large numbers of workers in these two industries. This policy is intended to turn Italian metallurgical and machine factories into equipment repair shops for American mechanized troops.

　　声援冶金及机器制造业工人斗争
    全意四百万产业工人举行总罢工十五分钟
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：在意大利总工会号召下，全意四百万产业工人在二十一日举行了十五分钟的总罢工，声援长期坚持反解雇、反关厂斗争的冶金与机器制造业的工人。在工人们罢工时，除了公用事业，全国一切企业都停止工作。同时，意大利各工业中心又发动了募捐运动，工人们纷纷捐献一个半小时的工资去援助他们艰苦斗争中的弟兄们。
    按：意大利冶金与机器工人从去年八月下旬就开始斗争，反对加斯贝利政府在这两种工业中实行减缩生产和大批解雇工人的政策。这种政策是要使意大利的冶金和机器工厂沦为美国机械化部队的装备修配厂。
