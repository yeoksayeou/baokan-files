The Chinese Industrial Cooperative International Committee has announced its dissolution. The Chinese Industrial Cooperative International Committee was an international organization formed by some Chinese and foreign individuals in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Its purpose was to raise machinery and funds from abroad to assist the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association (referred to as "Gung Ho") in the industrial cooperative movement it advocated in various parts of the rear. In the past, the committee promoted and introduced the Chinese cooperative movement abroad and raised funds and machinery for industrial cooperatives in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and old liberated areas at that time.

Those who participated in the work of the committee included Carlson (US), Hogg (UK), Rewi Alley (New Zealand), He Minghua (UK), P.R. Hayward (US), Smedley (US), Townson (UK), Chen Hansheng, Wu Yaozong, Shen Tilan, Meng Yongqian, Deng Yuzhi, Chen Yiming, etc.

However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, the real cooperative cause was greatly hindered. The initial hopes of the "Gung Ho" movement were not realized. The number of cooperatives in the Kuomintang-controlled areas decreased from thousands to hundreds with the development of the war and suffered persecution. Today, in liberated China, the cooperative movement, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, has achieved unprecedented development, far exceeding the scale envisioned by the "Gung Ho" movement in the past. All the industrial cooperatives remaining in the "Gung Ho" Association have joined the local cooperative federations; its training school in Shandan, Gansu, continues to operate under the leadership of a school affairs committee jointly composed of representatives of the school's staff and students and representatives of local authorities.

Recently, in view of the fact that the Chinese "Gung Ho" Association has been merged into the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and China's cooperative cause has been established on a solid and self-reliant basis and has developed, the Chinese Industrial Cooperative International Committee, which has made sponsoring efforts for China's cooperative cause, now believes that there is no need for its continued existence. For this reason, the Chinese Industrial Cooperative International Committee held a meeting in Beijing on January 28, 1951, and decided to end its work and issued the following statement:

"We are honored that in the past we have provided some assistance to the development of China's cooperative cause through the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association. We now formally announce the end of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative International Committee, because our hope has been realized -- a new progressive cooperative movement, including various cooperatives, including industrial cooperatives, and a cooperative movement that is many times stronger than we imagined has been launched. The existing industrial cooperatives have become part of the national cooperative cause under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the cooperative cause of the great Chinese people has grown; we feel very honored to have contributed our small amount of strength in its early development."

### 中国“工合”国际委员会结束

　　中国“工合”国际委员会结束
    中国工业合作国际委员会已宣告结束。中国工业合作国际委员会是抗日战争初期一些中外人士合组的一个国际团体，其目的是从国外募集机器和基金，来协助中国工业合作协会（简称“工合”）当时在后方各地所倡导的工业合作运动。该委员会过去向国外宣传介绍了中国的合作运动，并为当时国民党统治区与老解放区的工业合作社募得款项和机器。
    曾参与该委员会工作者，有：卡尔逊（美），何克（英），艾黎（新西兰），何明华（英），普爱德（美），史迈士（美），唐逊（英），陈翰笙，吴耀宗，沈体兰，孟用潜，邓裕志，陈乙明等。
    但是过去在国民党反动派统治之下，真正的合作事业备受阻挠，最初“工合”运动所怀抱的希望未能实现，国民党统治区的合作社数目随着战争的发展从数千减至数百，并遭受到迫害。今天在解放了的中国，合作社运动在中华全国合作社联合总社领导之下，已获得空前发展，远远超过过去“工合”运动所设想的规模。所有“工合”协会所存留的工业合作社都已加入当地的合作社联合总社；其设立于甘肃山丹的训练学校亦在由该校员工学生代表及地方当局代表共同组成之校务委员会领导下继续工作。
    最近，鉴于中国“工合”协会已归并于中华全国合作社联合总社，中国的合作事业已建立在坚强的和自力更生的基础上并开展起来，曾为中国合作事业作过赞助努力的中国工业合作国际委员会现已认为无继续存在之需要。为此中国工业合作国际委员会乃于一九五一年一月二十八日在北京召开会议，决定结束其工作，并发表声明如下：
    “我们很荣幸，在过去我们曾通过中国工业合作协会，对于中国合作事业的发展，有过一些帮助。我们现在正式宣告结束中国工业合作国际委员会，因为我们的希望已经实现——一个新的进步的合作运动，包括各种合作，也包括工业合作，而且比我们想像强大许多倍的合作运动已然开展起来了。现存的各工业合作社并已成为全国合作社联合总社领导下的全国合作事业的一部分。在人民政府领导之下，伟大的中国人民的合作事业已经壮大起来；在其发展的初期，我们曾尽过的力量虽然很小，但因而感到十分的光荣。”（新华社）
