　　After the Execution of a Group of Arch-Criminal Counter-Revolutionaries,
    The Capital is Elated
    Counter-Revolutionary Elements Confess and Confess Voluntarily
    [Our Newspaper's Report] After the Beijing Military Control Commission's Military Law Office executed a group of KMT-US spies, heads of reactionary secret societies, habitual bandits, and despots on the 25th, the people of the capital applauded and cheered this event. They said, "A good killing! A correct execution! The People's Government should have done this a long time ago!"
    At noon on the 25th, when the prison trucks carrying these counter-revolutionary criminals passed through the streets on their way to the execution grounds, passersby stopped to cheer. When the trucks arrived at Xiannimen Street, people stopped the trucks and shouted, "Drag these bastards down and beat them!" Gu Bincheng, a representative of revolutionary military families from the Fifth District, said, "Yesterday at Zhongshan Park, I personally heard the victims accuse these murderous devils of their crimes, which made me hate them and grind my teeth. It's too good for these inhuman bastards to have lived until today." After these criminals were executed, the masses who had been persecuted still couldn't quell their anger. Wu Xisan from Nan Yangzhuang pointed at the corpse of the spy Guo Songyuan and said, "I'm late today. If I had come earlier, I would have asked you: Do you deserve to be shot? When the Japanese devils were here, you seized my house and trees and even wanted to shoot me! You made me wander outside for more than ten years. Guo Songyuan! Your day has come!" After the despot "Southern Tyrant," "Living阎王" Wang Dianrong was brought to justice, a vendor named Ma Yuan said, "In the past, who wasn't afraid when Wang Er Taiye Wang Dianrong was mentioned in the Zhangyimen area? If it weren't for the People's Government, no one could have subdued him." After the arch-criminals of the Yiguandao sect, Han Delu and Han Dexi, who murdered fifteen people, were executed, a mason named Pan Dehua said, "These two kids' crimes were too great. These two lives of theirs can't compensate for the fifteen lives!" Shi Zhenxiang, a shoemaker living in the Second District, said, "For these people, even execution is too light. For a big spy like Wang Fengchao, who murdered more than 400 people, I think he should be stabbed to death with an awl, needle by needle!"
    Wu Tianguang, a rickshaw puller living in Zhoujiadayuan in the Outer Third District, said, "This year, the government is building houses and executing counter-revolutionaries. Our days will be better in the future!" Liang Xiuling, a representative of the Seventh District who participated in the expanded joint conference of people's representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, said, "Yesterday, our representatives from all walks of life requested the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at the meeting, and today the government has carried out the people's wishes. Such a government is truly democratic!"
    The counter-revolutionary elements are truly trembling under such suppression. They are beginning to realize that there are only two paths before them: confessing their crimes to the people and repenting, or being eliminated by the people. A "committee member" of the China Democratic Socialist Party under the control of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Guangru, said, "There's no room for ambiguity now; if you want to live, you must honestly bow your head to the people." Wang Shilu, a KMT major general under control, said, "There are still some people who harmed the people with me in the past that I haven't fully confessed. Now, I can't hide it anymore." Some long-term hidden counter-revolutionary elements surrendered to the public security organs that night. Some family members of reactionary elements also voluntarily handed over hidden guns.

　　处决一批反革命首恶后
    首都人心大快
    反革命分子纷纷自首坦白
    【本报讯】北京市军事管制委员会军法处在二十五日枪决了一批美蒋特务、反动会道门头子、惯匪和恶霸后，首都人民对这件事情，鼓掌欢呼，他们说：“杀得好！崩得对！人民政府早就该这么办！”
    二十五日的中午，刑车载着这批反革命罪犯经过大街，驰向刑场的时候，街头行人驻足称快。刑车开到西安门大街时，人们拦住刑车高喊：“把这些兔崽子拉下来，揍揍他！”第五区革命军人家属代表古禀诚说：“我昨天在中山公园亲耳听到受害的人们控诉这些杀人魔王的罪行，真使我痛恨得咬牙切齿。让这些毫无人性的坏家伙活到今天，真是便宜了他们。”这些罪犯被枪决后，受过迫害的群众还愤恨难消。南杨庄吴锡三指着特务郭松元的尸体说：“我今天来晚了。我要早来了，一定要问问你：枪毙你该不该？日本鬼子在这里的时候，你霸占我的房子和树木，还要枪毙我！害得我在外边流浪了十几年。郭松元！你也有今天呀！”恶霸“南霸天”、“活阎王”王殿荣伏法后，摊贩马元说：“过去在彰仪门一带提起了王二太爷王殿荣，谁不害怕？要不是人民政府，那是没人能制服他的。”杀害十五条人命的一贯道首恶韩德禄、韩德喜被枪决后，瓦匠潘德华说：“这两个小子的罪恶太大了，他们这两条命怎么也抵不上十五条人命啊！”住在第二区的鞋匠史真祥说：“对于这些人，只是枪毙还轻。像王凤巢这种杀害四百多条人命的大特务，我看就得用锥子一针一针地扎死他才对！”
    住在外三区周家大院的三轮车工人吴天光说：“今年政府又盖房，又毙反革命，咱们以后的日子好过了！”参加过北京市市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议的第七区区代表梁秀岭说：“昨天我们各界代表在会上要求镇压反革命，今天政府就执行了人民的意见。这样的政府真民主！”
    反革命分子在这样镇压下真正发抖了。他们开始认识摆在他们面前的道路只有两条：向人民认罪悔过，或者被人民消灭。受公安局管制的民社党的一个“委员”王光如说：“现在可不能含糊了；要活就得老老实实向人民低头。”被管制的蒋匪军少将王世禄说：“还有一些过去同我一道为害人民的人，我没有完全坦白出来。现在，我不能再隐瞒了。”还有一些长期隐藏的反革命分子，当天晚上就向公安机关自首。有些反动分子的家属也自动交出隐藏的枪枝。
