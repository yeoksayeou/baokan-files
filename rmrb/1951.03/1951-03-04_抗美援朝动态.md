	Anti-US and Aid-Korea Movement Updates
		The Anti-US and Aid-Korea Movement in the Southwest Region
	The Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement in the Southwest region is developing from major cities to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas.
	From November of last year to the end of January this year, over 840,000 people in the Southwest region participated in Anti-US and Aid-Korea parades, with 240,000 in Chongqing alone. The patriotic movement has now expanded from central cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guiyang to smaller cities, and has also affected some rural areas and ethnic minority regions.
	The development of the patriotic movement in cities generally progresses from general publicity, studying current Anti-US and Aid-Korea affairs, and general mass demonstrations to in-depth publicity and demonstrations by all sectors of society. It also evolves from general mass demonstrations to denouncing the atrocities of the U.S. military and American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, and denouncing American imperialism's economic and cultural aggression against China. This method of educating the masses with facts from their own experiences has proven to be particularly effective. During the movement, the pro-American and fear-of-America sentiments that originally existed among the business community, upper-level intellectuals, and some students have been quickly clarified. In particular, the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of young students is very high during the movement. At the same time, the market for counter-revolutionary rumors in various places has been greatly reduced, and the activities of secret agents have been severely打击 (hit/attacked); the patriotic movement has played a significant role in promoting increased production, completing tax collection, reducing rent, refunding deposits, and establishing local armed forces. During the movement, Chongqing and Chengdu piloted the work of establishing propagandists, which was very effective.
	The patriotic movement has not yet been launched in most rural areas, and the movement in cities has not been fully developed. Those deeply influenced by American imperialism, such as upper-level figures in religious circles, some industrialists and businessmen, some upper-level intellectuals, and students in missionary schools, as well as some retained employees, still have very poor patriotic awareness and have not yet established a mentality of hating and despising the United States. Therefore, the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement in the Southwest region now needs to focus on developing in areas (especially rural areas) and strata where the movement has not yet developed or has not been fully developed.
		The Anti-US and Aid-Korea Movement in Rural Areas of Hebei Province
	In the small and medium-sized cities and most rural areas of Hebei Province, the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement has been launched quite widely. This movement has played a significant role in raising the political awareness of the people and promoting various tasks such as grain requisition and taxation, and strengthening people's armed forces.
	The main experiences in Anti-US and Aid-Korea propaganda in Hebei Province are:
	(1) It is necessary to conduct propaganda that addresses the specific ideological problems of different regions and groups of people. For example, many people in Linqing Town were deeply influenced by the deceptive propaganda of the United States using relief materials as a means. They once thought that "the United States is not bad" and "the United States is a charitable (!) country." The leading authorities addressed this situation by exposing the truth about the so-called "relief materials" from the United States. As a result, the people generally recognized the exploitative and deceptive nature of American "relief." Some said, "The weasel greets the chicken for the New Year, it has no good intentions." Some said, "I thought the United States was good because I wore a pair of broken leather shoes, and that's exactly what the United States wanted." For example, many businessmen in Xingtai Town mistakenly believed that "whoever comes here will do business, and businessmen don't need to care about politics." The local propaganda workers used the fact that the fur industry and other industries in Xingtai Town completely collapsed during the Japanese occupation to illustrate that if American imperialism came, business would be impossible. As a result, the patriotic understanding of the business community in Xingtai was greatly improved, and they completed all tax payments and back taxes within two days.
	(2) When conducting propaganda, it is necessary to adopt a method that goes from small to large and from near to far. It is necessary to start from the immediate interests of the masses and talk about the necessity of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. For example, when conducting propaganda to farmers, start with the reactionary landlords' counterattacks against farmers and the sabotage of secret agents, and then explain that this is the internal activity of American imperialism in its attempt to invade China again, thereby explaining why it is necessary to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and analyze the world situation to explain the inevitable success of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
	(3) Link Anti-US and Aid-Korea with the main local tasks for propaganda. Wherever this has been done, the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement has been developed in depth, and various practical tasks have been promoted. Conversely, for example, the CPC Xingtai First District Committee separated the work of reorganizing branches and winter production from the Anti-US and Aid-Korea propaganda work, and belittled this propaganda work, with the result that this work did not have its due effect.
	(4) Mobilize patriotic activists from all walks of life to conduct propaganda in various ways according to their own professional conditions. For example, public and private shops in Longyao Town printed various Anti-US and Aid-Korea cartoons, clappers, drum lyrics, poems, slogans, etc. on the wrapping paper of goods. Even "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country" was printed in gold letters on large candles. These propaganda materials are widely circulated and have a great impact. Zhao County's use of tooth merchants (交易员) (traders) with relatively correct political understanding for propaganda has also been very effective.
	As for mobilizing the masses to make accusations and recollections, mobilizing all walks of life to hold forums and parades, and other places, it has also proven to be an extremely effective method in Hebei Province.
	At present, the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement has not yet been launched in some villages and remote areas of Hebei Province, and some counties have not developed it very well. Most women and most religious people have not participated in this movement. Some farmers in old liberated areas still think: "The American emperor is far away from us, it won't hurt us." Therefore, they have not actively participated in the patriotic movement. Even some working cadres have not been mobilized. For example, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Dongwei Village, Cheng'an County, does not even know that Korea is a country. Although some places have generally conducted Anti-US and Aid-Korea propaganda, they have not yet formed a truly mass patriotic movement. In many villages, they only held one or two meetings, and the village cadres simply spoke a few words and it was over. Therefore, how to make the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement truly deeply and universally developed in Hebei Province still requires great efforts.
		The Patriotic Movement in Various Cities of Fujian is Developing
	The Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement in various cities of Fujian Province, located on the Southeast defense front, is unfolding. At present, the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement being carried out in cities, and the land reform movement being carried out in some rural areas, have given the province a completely new atmosphere.
	The patriotic movement has been developed relatively well in the four cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, especially among students. In January of this year, students in Zhangzhou expelled the American school board member Bu Xianli, and students in Fuzhou expelled another imperialist, the Spanish Xue Renkan, and patriotic enthusiasm was high. These imperialists resolutely opposed the Chinese people and were hated by the student masses. For example, Xue Renkan, the director of Yangguang Middle School in Fuzhou, not only carried out anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-Chinese people propaganda on weekdays, but also openly undermined the students' Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement recently. At a meeting where students were discussing the Anti-US and Aid-Korea issue, Xue actually threw a tangerine peel at Li Pengcheng, a student who spoke out against American aggression, and threw chalk at other students. Xue also tore up the Anti-US and Aid-Korea script that students were rehearsing and expelled students who were holding group meetings to discuss current affairs. At the same time, Xue also collected many reactionary pamphlets issued by the American imperialist secret service in Hong Kong specifically to undermine China's religious reform movement, provoke Sino-Soviet friendship, slander the Chinese people, and promote pro-Americanism, and used these reactionary pamphlets to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda. The students of Yangguang Middle School could no longer tolerate it, so they held a conference on February 1 to accuse Xue Renkan and expel him from the school.
	The significant achievements of the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement in various cities in Fujian are mainly reflected in the following two things: First, 15,000 students in the province have signed up to join military cadre schools, and their patriotic enthusiasm is high; second, the business community has overfulfilled its tax payment tasks after launching the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement. In addition, some enterprises have launched a patriotic production competition, which is currently being continued; students are assisting the government in registering missionary schools and other tasks.
	The patriotic movement in Fujian Province, like in other provinces, is currently limited to some cities. How to popularize the patriotic movement among the people in both urban and rural areas throughout the province is a problem that must be solved through hard work.

专栏：抗美援朝动态

　　抗美援朝动态
            西南区的抗美援朝运动
    西南区的抗美援朝运动，正由各大城市向中小城市及乡村发展。
    自去年十一月至今年一月底，西南各地参加抗美援朝游行者已在八十四万人以上，其中重庆一地达二十四万人。爱国运动现已由重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳等中心城市向较小城市发展，并已波及一部分乡村及少数民族地区。
    爱国运动在城市中的发展，一般是由一般的宣传、学习抗美援朝时事和一般的群众示威游行，发展为各界各业的深入宣传和示威游行，并由一般的群众示威发展到控诉美军及美蒋特务暴行和控诉美帝国主义对中国的经济和文化侵略。这种以群众的亲身经历的事实来教育群众自己的方法，证明是特别有效的。在运动中，工商界、上层知识分子和部分学生中原来存在的崇美和恐美思想，已被迅速澄清，特别是广大的青年学生，在运动中爱国情绪十分高涨。同时各地反革命谣言市场都大为缩小，特务活动受到很大打击；而爱国运动对于增加生产、完成税收以及减租、退押、建立地方武装等工作，都起了很大推动作用。在运动中重庆、成都均试办了设立宣传员的工作，很有成效。
    爱国运动在多数乡村尚未展开，在城市中运动也未充分发展，那些受美国帝国主义影响较深的人们，例如宗教界的上层人物、部分工商业家、部分上层知识分子和教会学校学生以及若干留用职员等，爱国觉悟还很差，还没有树立仇美、鄙美的心理。因此，西南区的抗美援朝运动现在需要向运动尚未发展或尚未充分发展的地区（特别是乡村）和阶层中着重地发展。
            河北省农村的抗美援朝运动
    在河北省的各中小城市和大部分农村中，抗美援朝运动已相当普遍地展开。这个运动，对于提高人民群众的政治觉悟和推动征粮征税、加强人民武装等各项工作都已经发生很大作用。
    河北省抗美援朝宣传的主要经验是：
    （一）要根据不同地区和群众的不同的思想问题，对症下药地进行宣传。例如临清镇不少人受美国以救济物资为手段的欺骗宣传较深，他们曾以为“美国不错”，“美国是慈善（！）国”。领导机关就针对这种情况，揭露美国所谓“救济物资”的真相。结果，人民群众普遍地认识了美国“救济”的剥削性和欺骗性。有的说：“黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心。”有的说：“我穿了一双破皮鞋就认为美国不错，这正是上了美国的当。”又如邢台镇的不少商人错误地认为“谁来也是做买卖，商人不必过问政治”，当地宣传工作人员就拿邢台镇在日本占领时期毛皮业等完全垮台的事实来说明如果美国帝国主义来了，买卖就无法做。结果邢台工商界的爱国认识大大提高，他们在两天内就全部完成了纳税和补缴欠税的任务。
    （二）进行宣传，要采取由小到大，由近而远的方法，要从群众的切身利益说到抗美援朝的必要。例如对农民进行宣传时，从反动地主对农民的反攻和特务分子的破坏说起，进而说明这就是美国帝国主义为妄想再来侵略中国的内线活动，从而说明何以必须抗美援朝，并分析世界大势，说明抗美援朝必然成功的前途。
    （三）把抗美援朝和当地各项主要工作联系起来进行宣传。凡是这样做了的都使抗美援朝运动得到深入的发展，并推动了各种实际工作。反之，例如中共邢台一区区委把整理支部、冬季生产等工作与抗美援朝宣传工作分离开来，看轻这个宣传工作，结果就使这个工作没有发生应有的作用。
    （四）发动各界人民的爱国积极分子，根据自己的业务条件，用各种方式进行宣传。例如隆尧镇各公营和私营商店，都在货物包装纸上印上各种抗美援朝的漫画、快板、鼓词、诗歌、标语口号等。甚至在大蜡烛上也印上“抗美援朝保家卫国”的金字。这种宣传品流传的范围很广，影响很大。赵县利用政治认识比较正确的牙纪（交易员）进行宣传，收效也很大。
    至于发动群众进行控诉、回忆，发动各行各业举行座谈和游行示威，和其他各地一样，在河北省也证明是极为有效的方式。
    目前抗美援朝运动在河北省的一部分村庄和僻远地区还没有开展，另有一些县份开展得还很差。大多数妇女，大多数宗教徒还没有参加这个运动。有些老区的农民群众还认为：“美帝离咱这里还远呢，吊不了蛋。”因此，他们还没有积极参加爱国运动。甚至有些工作干部也没有发动起来，例如成安县东魏村的青年团支部委员还不知道朝鲜是一个国家。有些地方虽然一般地进行了抗美援朝的宣传，但是还没有形成真正群众性的爱国运动，有很多村子，只是开了一两次会，由村干部三言两语地讲了一下就算完事。因此，如何使抗美援朝运动在河北省真正深入普遍地发展，还需要极大的努力。
            福建各城市的爱国运动正在发展
    东南国防前线福建省各城市的抗美援朝运动正在展开。目前在城市中进行的抗美援朝运动，和在一部分农村中进行的土地改革运动，已使该省气象一新。
    爱国运动在福州、厦门、泉州、漳州四个城市开展得比较好，尤以学生中展开得最为热烈。本年一月间漳州学生驱逐了帝国主义分子美籍校董卜显理，福州学生驱逐了另一帝国主义分子西班牙籍薛仁堪，爱国情绪高涨。这些帝国主义分子都是坚决反对中国人民，而为学生群众所痛恨的。例如福州扬光中学主任理事薛仁堪，不但平日即进行反苏反共反中国人民的宣传，最近还公然破坏学生的抗美援朝运动。在学生们举行讨论抗美援朝问题的集会上，薛竟以柑子皮投在一发言指斥美国侵略的学生李鹏程的鼻子上，并用粉笔头向其他学生投掷。薛又曾撕毁学生正在排演的抗美援朝剧本，驱逐开小组会讨论时事的学生。同时，薛还收藏美帝国主义在香港的特务机关专为破坏中国宗教革新运动、挑拨中苏友谊、诽谤中国人民和鼓吹崇美而散发的反动小册子多种，并依据这些反动小册子进行反革命宣传。扬光中学的学生们忍无可忍，遂于二月一日举行控诉薛仁堪的大会，将其驱逐出校。
    福建各城市抗美援朝运动的显著成绩，主要表现在以下两件事上：一是全省有一万五千学生报名参加军事干部学校，爱国情绪热烈；二是工商界在展开抗美援朝运动后超额完成纳税任务。此外，部分企业单位已展开爱国生产竞赛，现正继续展开；学生们正在协助政府进行登记教会学校等工作。
    福建省的爱国运动，和其他省份一样，目前还只限于一部分城市。怎样把爱国运动普及到全省城乡人民中间去，这是一个必须努力解决的问题。
