　　The procession of peace petitions organized by the American Peace Crusaders arrived in Washington this month on the 16th and expressed to the US Congress the desire of peace-loving Americans to end the war of aggression against Korea, and to oppose the US rearming of West Germany and Japan. This is a powerful action by the American people to strive for peace and oppose the Truman government's war policy.
    After suffering serious setbacks in the war of aggression against Korea, the United States' continued adherence to its criminal policy of aggression and intensified war preparations has increasingly aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the American people. After the American Peace Crusaders issued a call for peace petitions in early February, it immediately received a response and support from various progressive American groups and the broad masses of the people. Those who successively announced their participation in the petition included: the American Women's Peace Committee, the Black People's Committee for the Defense of Peace and Unity, the New York Veterans League, the New York Labor Peace Conference Committee, and many local branches of various trade unions. The American Jewish Labor Conference also called on all branches to participate in the petition. The scattered and spontaneous demands for peace by the American people have thus gradually formed into an organized joint action.
    The petition action of the American Peace Crusaders shows that the American people are awakening and the internal peace forces in the United States are growing. The difficulties facing the warmongers are constantly increasing.
    The American people's movement for peace, with the support of peace-loving people around the world, will grow stronger. As long as the American people and the people of all countries in the world jointly persevere in the cause of defending world peace to the end, the conspiracy of the American warmongers to launch another world war can be shattered.

　　美国和平运动在成长中
    美国和平十字军所组织的和平请愿的队伍，已于本月十六日到达了华盛顿，并向美国国会表示了爱好和平的美国人民要求结束侵朝战争、反对美国重新武装西德和日本。这是美国人民争取和平、反对杜鲁门政府战争政策的有力行动。
    美国在侵朝战争中遭受到严重挫败后，继续坚持侵略及加紧扩大战争准备的罪恶政策，已日益为广大的美国人民所不满。美国和平十字军于二月初发出和平请愿的号召后，立即得到美国各进步团体和广大人民的响应与支持。陆续宣布参加请愿的有：美国妇女和平委员会、黑人保卫和平统一委员会，纽约退伍军人联盟、纽约劳工和平大会委员会及各工会的许多地方分会，美国犹太劳工会议也号召各分会参加请愿。美国人民分散自发的和平要求，已因此而逐渐形成为有组织的共同行动了。
    美国和平十字军的请愿行动，显示了美国人民正在觉醒，美国内部的和平力量正在成长。战争贩子们面前的困难，是时时都在增加着。
    美国人民争取和平的运动，在世界爱好和平人民的支持下，是会壮大起来的。只要美国人民与世界各国人民共同把保卫世界和平的事业坚持到底，美国战争贩子发动另一次世界战争的阴谋计划，就可以打破。
