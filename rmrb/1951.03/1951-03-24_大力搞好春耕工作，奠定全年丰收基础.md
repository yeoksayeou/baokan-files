　　Vigorously Carry Out Spring Plowing to Lay the Foundation for a Full Harvest Year
　　Spring plowing has arrived, and some areas have already entered a tense stage of spring plowing. Today, the Central Ministry of Agriculture issued instructions to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing to ensure timely sowing, and put forward clear requirements for spring plowing work. All localities should launch a vigorous spring plowing campaign in accordance with these instructions.
　　Spring plowing work should be the overriding center of all rural work at present. The State Council of the Central People's Government, in its "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951," clearly instructed: "Areas where land reform is currently underway should strive to complete land reform before spring plowing as much as possible; even if it cannot be completed as scheduled, efforts should be made to bring it to a stage. Areas where land reform has not yet begun should not begin for the time being, so as to be able to quickly and without missing the farming season, concentrate all efforts on leading agricultural production and strive for a bumper harvest this year." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated in its instructions on March 5 that Party committees at all levels must "accurately grasp the guiding principle of taking agricultural production as the overriding central task in rural work during the agricultural production season." Party and government organs in all localities should immediately check and grasp the progress of land reform in accordance with these instructions, and ensure that when spring plowing has arrived, they "quickly and without violating the farming season, concentrate all efforts on leading agricultural production."
　　This year's spring plowing work has more favorable conditions than last year. Last year, the country had a bumper harvest; and this year, nearly 300 million farmers have completed or are about to complete land reform, and areas where land reform has not been carried out have also implemented thorough rent reduction and deposit refunds; the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has initially unfolded in rural areas, and bandits, secret agents, and local bullies have been initially suppressed; the farmers' surplus grain and sideline production have been guaranteed outlets due to the exchange of native products. These are all important guarantees for mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm for production and successfully completing this year's spring plowing tasks. Whether in the old and new areas that have completed land reform, as long as the leadership is good, an unprecedented and enthusiastic spring plowing and production situation will surely emerge. However, if the leading organs are ideologically paralyzed and relax their leadership, many favorable conditions will not be effective for this year's spring plowing due to the delay in time. All localities must promptly correct this paralyzed and careless thinking, so as not to miss the spring plowing. There is no doubt that there are many difficulties in spring plowing production in areas where land reform has not been completed and newly completed. There are also many problems in the old areas where land reform has been completed long ago. For example, in some cotton-producing areas, about 40 to 50 percent of the cotton fields have not been plowed; the lack of draft animals is a very common phenomenon, and animal epidemics are prevalent this spring, with foot-and-mouth disease occurring in 50 counties in 7 provinces, and bovine plague occurring in 28 counties in 6 provinces; the preparation of fertilizers, seeds, and farm implements is also insufficient in some areas. As for the farmers in areas that have not undergone land reform, the difficulties will certainly be greater. Of course, these difficulties can be completely overcome, and the question is whether we can seize the opportunity and earnestly do the work of overcoming difficulties.
　　In addition to increasing grain production, increasing the planting of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp is an extremely important task for increasing agricultural production in 1951, and this spirit must be implemented in this year's spring plowing. The State Council has clearly announced incentive policies for increasing the planting of industrial raw material crops, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council has also announced reasonable parity prices for cotton and hemp in relation to grain. The enthusiasm for increasing the planting of industrial raw material crops has generally increased in various localities. However, some farmers still have various concerns. Therefore, in addition to vigorously publicizing the policies of the State Council and the Financial and Economic Committee to farmers, local governments must assist cooperatives and trade departments in launching a pre-purchase contract campaign for industrial raw materials such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp. Experience has proven that the widespread signing of pre-purchase contracts is a powerful measure to increase farmers' enthusiasm for production and eliminate their concerns, and all localities must vigorously promote it in a timely manner. However, carrying out a pre-purchase contract campaign is a complex task. In addition to thoroughly publicizing and explaining to farmers, it is necessary to appropriately stipulate the procedures and methods for pre-purchase contracts, especially the method of calculating prices, which must be carefully stipulated to ensure that neither farmers nor cooperatives suffer losses (mainly to ensure that farmers do not suffer losses). The contract should clearly stipulate that if the market price is lower than the parity price at the time of purchase, it will be purchased at the parity price; if the market price is higher than the parity price, in addition to the portion of grain funds prepaid, the remainder will be allowed for farmers to sell to the market. In addition, methods for farmers to "place orders" should be formulated to ensure the supply of important materials such as grain, coal, seeds, fertilizers, medicines, and machinery needed by farmers. The development of pre-purchase contract campaigns cannot only rely on cooperatives and trade departments alone; Party committees, people's governments, and relevant departments (banks, agriculture, etc.) at all levels must vigorously assist. Taking cotton as an example, efforts should be made to have more than half of the cotton contracted before the new cotton is on the market to ensure the successful completion of the production increase task.
　　In this year's spring plowing production, farmers should be mobilized to launch a broad mass agricultural production competition campaign, and this movement should be combined with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. At present, the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and defend the country is gradually unfolding in rural areas across the country; many places have combined the patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea with agricultural production, and have loudly put forward the slogan "Produce more grain to consolidate national defense," and some areas have already started patriotic production competition campaigns. Li Shunda's mutual aid team, an agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province, has challenged the whole country, and Northeast China, northern Sichuan, and other places have already begun to respond to the challenge. All localities should immediately mobilize labor models and mutual aid teams to discuss Li Shunda's challenge conditions, organize them to respond to the challenge, and should focus on organizing local labor models and mutual aid teams to conduct local production competitions. The patriotic production competition movement is a concrete combination of the overall interests of the country and the farmers' own interests, is the main content of carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in rural areas, and is also an important way to promote spring plowing production. All localities should grasp this link and launch a vigorous spring plowing campaign on the basis of resisting America and aiding Korea.
　　Doing a good job in spring plowing is the key to ensuring a full harvest year. Time is already pressing, let us mobilize urgently and welcome the great battle of spring plowing production!

### 大力搞好春耕工作，奠定全年丰收基础

　　大力搞好春耕工作，奠定全年丰收基础
    春耕已到，有些地区已经进入紧张的春耕阶段，中央农业部今天发布了加强春耕领导保证适时播种的指示，对春耕工作提出了明确的要求。各地应当根据这个指示，展开轰轰烈烈的春耕运动。
    春耕工作应当是目前农村压倒一切的中心。中央人民政府政务院在“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中，曾明确地指示：“现在正在进行土地改革的地区，应尽可能地争取在春耕以前结束土地改革；即使不能如期结束者，亦应力求告一段落。凡土地改革尚未开始者，则暂时不要开始，以便能迅速地不误农时地集中全力转入领导农业生产，争取今年丰收。”中共中央在三月五日的指示中规定各级党委必须“在农业生产季节，准确掌握以农业生产为农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务这个指导方针”。各地党、政机关，应即根据这些指示，检查并掌握土地改革的进程，保证在春耕已经到来的时候，“迅速地不违农时地集中全力转入领导农业生产”。
    今年的春耕工作，比去年有更有利的条件。去年全国丰收；而且今年已有将近三万万农民完成了或将要完成土地改革，没有进行土地改革的地区也实行了彻底的减租退押；抗美援朝运动在农村中已初步展开，土匪、特务、恶霸已受到了初步的镇压；农民的多余粮食和副业生产已因土产交流而有了出路的保证。这都是发动农民生产热情，胜利完成今年春耕任务的重要保证。无论在已经完成土地改革的老区和新区，只要领导得好，一定可以出现一个空前未有的热烈的春耕生产的局面。但是，如果领导机关思想麻痹，放松领导，许多有利的条件都将会因时间的延误而对今年春耕不起作用。各地必须及时纠正这种麻痹大意的思想，以免遗误春耕。毫无疑问，未完成及新完成土地改革的地区，对于春耕生产存在着不少的困难。在早已完成土地改革的老区，问题也很多。例如：某些棉区约有百分之四、五十的棉田，尚未翻耕；耕畜缺乏是很普遍的现象，而且今春畜疫流行，口蹄疫已有七省五十个县发生，发生牛瘟的有六个省二十八个县；对肥料、种子、农具的准备，有的地区也很不足。至于尚未经土地改革地区的农民，困难当会更多。当然，这些困难是完全可以克服的，问题在于能否抓紧时机，切切实实作克服困难的工作。
    在增产粮食之外，增种棉、烟、麻等工业原料作物，是一九五一年农业增产极为重要的一项任务，今年春耕中必须贯彻这个精神。政务院已经明确地宣布了增种工业原料作物的奖励政策，政务院财政经济委员会亦宣布了棉粮和麻粮的合理比价，各地增种工业原料作物的情绪，已普遍提高。但有些农民，仍然存在各种顾虑，因此，除还须大力向农民宣传政务院和财政经济委员会的政策外，各地政府必须协助合作社及贸易部门，展开棉、烟、麻等工业原料的预购合同运动。经验证明，普遍订立预购合同，是提高农民生产热情，消除农民顾虑的有力措施，各地必须及时地大力推行。但开展预购合同运动，是一个复杂的工作。除须深入地向农民宣传解释外，必须适当规定预购合同的手续和办法，特别是计算价格的办法，尤须审慎规定，以保证农民与合作社两不吃亏（主要是农民不致吃亏）。合同应明确规定，在收购时，如市价低于比价，则按比价收购，如市价高于比价，则除预支粮款部分须按比价收购外，其余允许农民向市场出售。此外，应订立农民“订货”办法，保证对农民所需粮、煤、种子、肥料、药械等重要物资的供应。开展预购合同运动，不能只靠合作社及贸易部门单独进行，各级党委、人民政府及有关部门（银行、农业等）必须大力协助。以棉花而论，应争取新棉上市前有半数以上的棉花都订了合同，以保证增产任务的胜利完成。
    在今年的春耕生产中，应当发动农民展开广泛的群众性的农业生产竞赛运动，并使这个运动与抗美援朝运动相结合。目前抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，正在全国农村逐步展开；许多地方已把抗美援朝的爱国运动和农业生产结合起来，响亮地提出了“多打粮食，巩固国防”的口号，有的地区已经开始了爱国主义的生产竞赛运动。山西省农业劳动模范李顺达互助组已向全国挑战，东北、川北等地已经开始应战。各地应即发动劳动模范和互助组讨论李顺达的挑战条件，组织他们应战，并应着重组织当地的劳动模范与互助组之间的进行地方性的生产竞赛。爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，是国家整体利益与农民本身利益的具体结合，是农村开展抗美援朝运动的主要内容，同时也是推动春耕生产的重要方式。各地应该掌握这一环节，在抗美援朝的基础上，开展轰轰烈烈的春耕运动。
    做好春耕工作，是保证全年丰收的关键。时间已经迫近了，紧急动员起来，迎接春耕生产的伟大战斗吧！
