The China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued a notice on March 14, calling on the people of the whole country to respond to the resolution of the World Peace Council, and to popularize and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea throughout the country. This notice put forward a standard for popularizing and deepening the practical work and propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea, which is "to ensure that every place and every person in the country receives this kind of patriotic education, and can actively participate in this patriotic action." The notice called on all people's organizations, people's congresses at all levels, propaganda, education and cultural institutions, and public places to formulate their own work plans for this purpose, and called on the people of cities and villages across the country to hold a universal large-scale demonstration on May 1st Labor Day, with resisting America and aiding Korea, opposing the armed Japan, and defending world peace as the main contents of the demonstration. This notice is a document of great significance. The people of the whole country should struggle to achieve the goals stipulated in this document.

In the past period, the movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea has already made great achievements. On the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side, and in the past four months, they have wiped out about 100,000 enemy troops, liberated most of the territory of Korea, and pushed the flames of the war of aggression ignited by the American aggressors from our border to the southern half of Korea. Now, although the Volunteers and the People's Army have temporarily withdrawn from Seoul again, this is to facilitate the annihilation of the enemy's living forces, and has no adverse effect on the overall situation. This can be proved by the rich experience of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War in the past and the experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers in several battles in Korea. In any case, as Marshal Stalin said to a reporter from Pravda, the final defeat of the American aggressor troops in Korea is doomed. Of course, the notice of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea is right: to completely eliminate the imperialist bandits who invaded Korea and completely liberate Korea, it is still necessary to go through a considerable period of resolute, courageous and intelligent operations. Therefore, the notice pointed out: All our compatriots must continue to adhere to the sacred struggle of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and strive to popularize and deepen the practical work and propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea.

During the period of resisting America and aiding Korea, an unprecedentedly high patriotic movement has emerged among the people of our country. From the end of October last year to the beginning of March this year, according to incomplete statistics published in local newspapers, more than 11 million people from all walks of life in more than 317 large, medium and small cities and market towns have held patriotic rallies and demonstrations to resist America and aid Korea and oppose the US arming of Japan. The number of people participating in the study of current events to resist America and aid Korea and other patriotic activities is even greater. This great high tide of people's patriotism has not only powerfully supported the operations of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front, but also rapidly swept away the aggressive forces and ideological influence of imperialism, especially American imperialism, in China, enhanced the national self-esteem and self-confidence of the Chinese people, and powerfully promoted the development of China's national defense, politics, economy, culture and other construction work.

However, at present, the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea has not been universally and deeply carried out among the people in various regions and at all levels. Up to now, this movement has not been launched or has not been well developed in most rural areas and small cities, and many people across the country have not received patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. Although the cultural and educational circles and the business community in major and medium-sized cities and a small number of small cities have participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea more extensively, their patriotic understanding and enthusiasm still need to be further consolidated. The patriotic movement of self-reliance, reform and innovation in religious circles has only just begun to develop. Women, who account for half of the population, only a small part have actively participated in the patriotic movement. Political and current affairs education among workers across the country has already shown its strength in the patriotic production competition, but it is still not very common. Due to scattered residences, most of the peasants have not received sufficient education on resisting America and aiding Korea.

Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to continue to popularize and deepen the propaganda and education movement to resist America and aid Korea throughout the country.

How should we implement the important call of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea?

In order to ensure that every place and every person in the country can receive patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, the patriotic elements and patriotic parties and groups across the country must unite and work together to carry out extensive and lasting work.

This requires all comrades of the Communist Party of China and all members of the democratic parties across the country to recognize the great political significance of continuing to popularize and deepen the propaganda and education of resisting America and aiding Korea, to earnestly attach importance to this work, so as to use great strength to expand the patriotic movement among the masses of the people across the country, in order to lead the patriotic high tide of the people across the country to continue to move forward.

This requires all people's organizations across the country, including the Federation of Trade Unions, the Farmers' Association, the Youth Federation, the Student Federation, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, religious organizations and other people's organizations, as well as people's congresses at all levels, to formulate a long-term plan for how to popularize and deepen patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the masses under their jurisdiction in the shortest possible time, and implement it. These plans should be announced in appropriate ways and reported to the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea or its local branches, so as to facilitate the understanding and inspection of the masses, as well as the mutual reference and cooperation of various groups.

This requires all propaganda, education and cultural institutions across the country, including newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, news agencies, radio stations, literary, artistic, drama, music and folk art groups, schools, cultural centers, libraries, etc., as well as the responsible persons of various public places, to formulate a long-term plan for carrying out systematic patriotic propaganda and education work on resisting America and aiding Korea according to their own conditions in the shortest possible time, and implement it. These plans should also be reported to the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea or its local branches.

This requires all localities, groups, and institutions to pay attention to the correct steps of the work. Generally speaking, the work should first focus on popularization, and for the convenience of the work, the National Demonstration on May 1st Labor Day can be used as the peak of the popularization movement, and then turn to focusing on deepening.

This requires all localities, groups, and institutions to pay attention to summarizing past experiences and promoting and developing all successful parts of them. The movement to resist America and aid Korea already has considerable experience across the country, but there is still a lack of serious summary until now. In order to realize the slogan of enabling every place and every person in the country to receive education on resisting America and aiding Korea and participate in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, the research, development and publicity of existing experience can no longer be delayed.

As long as the 475 million Chinese people unite as one, and the Chinese people and the people of the world unite as one, the American imperialist plan of aggression and war in Korea and in the world can be completely defeated. The final victory of the Chinese people's cause of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend world peace is beyond doubt, and all our people should work together.

### （一）必须使全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育

　　（一）必须使全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育
    中国人民抗美援朝总会在三月十四日发出通告，号召全国人民响应世界和平理事会的决议，并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动。这个通告提出了一个普及和深入抗美援朝的实际工作和宣传工作的标准，就是“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这种爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国行动”。这个通告号召各人民团体、各级人民代表会议、各宣传教育文化机构、各公共场所，都为此目的而制订自己的工作计划，并且号召全国城市和乡村的人民，在今年五一劳动节举行普遍的大示威，以抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平为示威的主要内容。这个通告是一项意义重大的文件。全国人民都应当为实现这个文件所规定的目标而斗争。
    在过去一个时期中，我国人民的抗美援朝运动已经有了伟大的成就。在抗美援朝的前线，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，在过去四个多月中，已经歼灭了十万左右的敌军，解放了朝鲜的大部分国土，把美国侵略者所燃起的侵略战争火焰，从我国的边境推到了朝鲜的南半部。现在志愿军和人民军虽然又暂时退出了汉城，但这是为着便于消灭敌人的有生力量，对于整个战局并无不利的影响，这是过去中国人民革命战争的丰富经验和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜几次战役的经验都可以证明的。无论如何，正如斯大林大元帅对真理报记者的谈话所说，美国侵略军在朝鲜的最后失败是注定了。当然，中国人民抗美援朝总会的通告说得对：要彻底消灭侵略朝鲜的帝国主义强盗，全部解放朝鲜，还必须经过一个相当时期的坚决、勇敢和机智的作战。因此，通告指出：我全国同胞必须继续坚持抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争，努力普及和深入抗美援朝的实际工作和宣传教育工作。
    我国人民在抗美援朝期间已经兴起了空前高涨的爱国运动。从去年十月底到今年三月初旬为止，据各地报章刊载的不完全材料统计已有三百一十七个以上的大、中、小城市和集镇的各界人民一千一百万人以上，举行了抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的爱国集会和示威游行。参加抗美援朝时事学习和其他各项爱国活动的人数更要多得多。这个伟大的人民爱国高潮，不但有力地支援了朝鲜前线我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的作战，而且迅速地扫除帝国主义首先是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力和思想影响，提高了我国人民的民族自尊和自信的心理，并且有力地推进了我国的国防、政治、经济、文化等各种建设工作的发展。
    但是目前抗美援朝的爱国运动，在各地区和各阶层人民中，还没有普遍深入地开展。迄今为止，这一运动在大部分农村和小城市还没有发动或者还没有很好地发展，全国很多的人民还没有受到抗美援朝的爱国教育。各大中城市和一小部分小城市中的文化教育界和工商界，虽然已经比较广泛地参加了抗美援朝运动，但是他们的爱国认识和热情还需要进一步巩固起来。宗教界的自立革新爱国运动还仅仅是开始发展。占人口半数的妇女，已经积极参加爱国运动的还只占小部分。全国职工中的时事政治教育已经在爱国主义的生产竞赛中表现出力量，但是也还很不普遍。由于居住分散，农民的大多数所受的抗美援朝的教育还很不充分。
    因此，在全国的范围内继续普及深入抗美援朝的宣传教育运动，是完全必要的。
    应当怎样来执行抗美援朝总会的重要号召呢？
    为使全国每一处每一人都能受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，全国的爱国分子和爱国的党派和团体，必须团结一致地共同努力，进行广大而持久的工作。
    这就要求中国共产党的全体同志和全国各民主党派的全体成员，都要认识继续普及深入抗美援朝宣传教育的重大政治意义，都要认真重视这个工作，从而用极大的力量，在全国人民群众中间扩展爱国运动，以便领导全国人民的爱国高潮继续向前推进。
    这就要求全国所有的人民团体，包括职工联合会、农民协会、青年联合会、学生联合会、民主妇女联合会、工商界联合会、各宗教团体和其他人民团体，以及各级人民代表会议，都在最短时间内，制订如何在所属群众中普及深入抗美援朝爱国教育的常年计划，并加以执行。这些计划，应当用适当的方法宣布，并向抗美援朝总会或其地方分会报告，以便于群众的了解和检查，以及各团体的互相参照配合。
    这就要求全国所有宣传教育文化机构，包括报纸、杂志、出版社、通讯社、广播电台、文学美术戏剧音乐曲艺团体、学校、文化馆、图书馆等，以及各种公共场所的负责人员，都在最短时间内，制订根据本身条件进行有系统的抗美援朝爱国宣传教育工作的常年计划，并加以执行。这些计划，也应当向抗美援朝总会或其地方分会报告。
    这就要求各地方、各团体、各机构注意到工作的正确的步骤。一般地说，应当把工作首先着重于普及，而为了工作的便利，又可以用五一劳动节的全国大示威作为普及运动的顶点，然后转而着重于深入。
    这就要求各地方、各团体、各机构注意到总结过去的经验，并推广和发展其中一切成功的部分。抗美援朝运动在全国已有相当丰富的经验，但是直到现在还缺少认真的总结。为了实现使全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝教育并参加抗美援朝工作的口号，研究、发展和宣传已有的经验，再也不能延迟了。
    只要四亿七千五百万中国人民一致团结起来，中国人民和全世界人民一致团结起来，美国帝国主义在朝鲜和在全世界的侵略计划和战争的计划是完全能够打败的。中国人民抗美援朝保卫世界和平事业的最后胜利是没有疑问的，我们全国人民应该共同努力。
