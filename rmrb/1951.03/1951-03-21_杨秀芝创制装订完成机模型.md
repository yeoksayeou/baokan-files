    Yang Xiuzhi Creates a Model of a Complete Binding Machine
    To the Editor:
    Comrade Yang Xiuzhi, deputy head of the binding section of our factory, after three months of painstaking research and with the help of the leadership, successfully created a model of a complete binding machine. The principle of Comrade Yang Xiuzhi's complete binding machine is to use the suction of a blower to suck up the folded pages one by one, and then use the rotation of a belt to match the pages together; then, according to the order of binding, successively staple the wire, apply glue, wrap the spine, and cut in the machine until the final binding is completed. If the machine is manufactured and used, according to rough estimates, the efficiency will be thirty times higher than the current general manual binding. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the design of the model, such as the overly complex components, which must be simplified after review by experts. However, it can be seen that Yang Xiuzhi has good inventive talent and deserves to be cultivated and improved by the state.
    Now our factory has encountered difficulties in the trial production of this machine: (1) When the factory management committee of our factory reviewed the production of the model, it approved a production fund of three million yuan, but the actual cost has exceeded ten million yuan. Further discussion of manufacturing or promotion is beyond the capacity of our factory's material and financial resources. (2) Comrade Yang Xiuzhi was born as a worker and has not studied the principles of mechanics. This model relies on his twenty years of binding experience, and was trial-produced step by step through his own careful consideration. Some of the structures are too complicated and require further review by experts to help make the parts more precise and the structure more scientific. Now we raise this issue and request that the relevant authorities come to our factory to review the model of this machine, and hope to cultivate and improve Comrade Yang Xiuzhi's inventive talent.
                       Liu Heshi, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region

    杨秀芝创制装订完成机模型编辑同志：
    我厂装订股副股长杨秀芝同志，经过三个月的苦心钻研和领导上的帮助，创制装订完成机模型成功。杨秀芝同志的装订完成机的原理，是利用风筒的吸力，把摺好的纸页子一一吸起来，再利用轮带的转动，把页子配在一起；然后按装订的次序，依次在机器里订铁丝、点浆糊、裹背、裁断直到最后装钉完成。如机器制成使用，据不精确的估计，效率较目前一般手工装钉，提高三十倍。当然，模型的设计还存在着不少缺点，像机件过于复杂，必须请专家审议后加以简化。但可以看出，杨秀芝有很好的发明创造才能，值得国家对他加以培养和提高。
    现在我厂对此项机器的试制遇到了困难：（一）在我厂工厂管理委员会审查模型的制作时，批准制作经费三百万元，现在实际费用超过了一千万元，进一步谈到制造或推广使用，已不是我厂物力财力所能负担。（二）杨秀芝同志出身工人，未学过机械原理，这部模型是依靠他二十几年装订工作的经验，经过自己深思熟虑，一步步摸索试制的，有的构造过于复杂，需要专家进一步审查，帮助把机件弄得更加精确，构造更加科学。现在我们把这个问题提出来，请求有关机关前来我厂审议这部机器的模型，并希望对杨秀芝同志的发明才能加以培养提高。
