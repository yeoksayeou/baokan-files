Reader's Letters

To the Editor:

    I have received your letter of February 20th. Comrade Cao Shikui's report that the Hengshui Department Store's seized sugar was stolen by militiamen is completely true. The cadres of the company were ideologically negligent, failed to check carefully, and the head office has ordered them to conduct a self-criticism. We are now reporting to you the handling process and our opinions on this matter:

    This time, approximately 20,000 jin of granulated sugar and approximately 4,700 jin of refined sugar were stolen. After the incident occurred, the Hengshui Department Store immediately reported it to the Hebei Provincial Department Store for handling. The provincial company immediately forwarded it to the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce and the Hengshui Armed Forces Department to investigate responsibility. It was not until February 15th that it was reported to our office. Because the matter was of great importance, our office immediately reported the situation to the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, requesting the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce to expedite the investigation and demanded that the losses be compensated. It is currently being processed.

    The theft of sugar by militiamen in Hengshui this time was indeed unexpected. However, the Hengshui Department Store and our head office should also conduct self-criticism. In the future, we will try our best to improve vigilance in our work and avoid unnecessary losses of state property. In order to learn from this lesson, the head office will supervise and inspect the work of companies at all levels at any time to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

            Li Ruxiu, Deputy Manager of China Department Store, March 6th

　　中国百货公司副经理李汝修来信编辑同志：
    二月二十日来信悉。曹士魁同志反映衡水百货公司接管食糖为民兵偷盗的事情完全是真实的。该公司干部思想上麻痹大意，疏于检查，总公司已令其进行检讨。兹将我们对这件事的处理经过及意见报告给你们：
    此次被盗砂糖计约二万余斤，炼糖约四千七百斤。事件发生后，衡水百货公司当即具报河北省百货公司处理，该省公司立即转请河北省商业厅与衡水武装部门追究责任。二月十五日始呈报我处。因事关重大，我处立即据情报请中央人民政府贸易部转饬河北省人民政府商业厅加急追究，并要求必须赔偿损失。刻正在处理中。
    此次衡水发生民兵盗糖事件，确实出乎意料之外。但衡水百货公司及我们总公司也是应该检讨的。今后我们在工作中当尽量提高警惕，避免使国家资财遭受不应有的损失。为接受这次教训，总公司将随时督促和检查各级公司工作，使不再发生类似的事情。
            中国百货公司副经理  李汝修三月六日
