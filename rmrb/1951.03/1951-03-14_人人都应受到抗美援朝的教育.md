Everyone Should Receive Education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea

Editor's Note:

    Beijing readers Fang Hong and An Ning have suggested that the propaganda and education work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea should be deepened into the "Dazayuan" (communal courtyard) and all unorganized masses. This is a correct suggestion.

    The movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in Beijing has been carried out relatively well and has achieved great results. However, if we measure it by the breadth and depth that every individual should receive education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea, raise their awareness, and demonstrate it in practical actions, we are still far from it. Taking the "Dazayuan" mentioned in Fang Hong's letter as an example, women know less about Resisting America and Aiding Korea than men, and unorganized small handicraftsmen know less than organized workers. Even among the few people in this "Dazayuan" who understand the principles of Resisting America and Aiding Korea the most, their understanding mostly comes from life experiences and some fragmented principles. They lack a systematic understanding of the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. In terms of thinking, many issues are still unclear. This makes it difficult to achieve what Comrade Peng Zhen said at the First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress: to enable every citizen to consciously and actively participate in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea.

    How to deepen the education work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea into workshops? Deepen it into remote streets? Deepen it into the "Dazayuan"? Popularize it to the depths of everyone's thoughts? These issues must now be resolved step by step. Readers from all regions are welcome to reflect various situations and problems to us.

### 人人都应受到抗美援朝的教育

　　人人都应受到抗美援朝的教育编者按：
    北京市读者方虹、安宁，提出了抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，应深入到大杂院及一切无组织的群众中去。这是一个正确的建议。
    北京市的抗美援朝运动开展得比较好，也有很大成绩。如果我们是以这样的广度和深度去衡量，即每一个人都应当受到抗美援朝的教育，提高了自己的觉悟并在实际行动上表现出来，那还是相差很远的。以方虹来信所指的大杂院来说，关于抗美援朝，妇女比男人知道的少，无组织的小手工业者，比有组织的工人知道的少。就是这个大杂院了解抗美援朝道理最多的几个人，他们的认识，也多半来自生活上的感受以及某些零碎片断的道理，他们对抗美援朝的运动缺乏系统的了解。在思想上，很多问题还是模糊不清的。这就难以达到彭真同志在京市三届一次各界人民代表会议中所说的：使每个市民都能自觉地积极地参加抗美援朝运动。
    如何把抗美援朝的教育工作深入车间？深入到偏僻的街道？深入大杂院？普及到每一个人的思想深处？这些问题现在必须有步骤地加以解决。欢迎各地读者反映各种情况和问题给我们。
