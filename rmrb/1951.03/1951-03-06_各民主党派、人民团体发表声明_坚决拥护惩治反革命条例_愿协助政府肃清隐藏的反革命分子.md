A spokesman for the Jiusan Society stated: Members of our society fully support the Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries of the People's Republic of China, and together with people from cultural, educational, and scientific circles across the country, will do their best to assist the government in fundamentally eliminating all counterrevolutionary activities.
