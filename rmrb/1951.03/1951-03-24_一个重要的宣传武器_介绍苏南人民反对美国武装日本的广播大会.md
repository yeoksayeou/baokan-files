　　An Important Propaganda Weapon
    ——Introducing the Broadcast Rally of the People of Southern Jiangsu Against the United States Arming Japan

    In order to popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, various localities should create all kinds of propaganda and mobilization forms loved by the masses. The broadcast rally of the people of Southern Jiangsu against the United States arming Japan, held in the Southern Jiangsu area on March 17th, is one of the best of these creations.

    The broadcast rally organized by the Southern Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station lasted for three consecutive days, setting off a new high tide in the opposition to American imperialism's rearming of Japan and the accusation of Japan's crimes of invading China among the people of Southern Jiangsu. Zheng Xiangde, director of the Wuxi Textile Industry Guild, recounted on the radio the evil deeds of the Japanese bandits in destroying 170,000 spindles in the city. People from Baoshan County, more than 500 miles away from Wuxi, also sent three representatives to accuse the Japanese bandits of their bloody crimes of burning, killing, and raping in the county. According to statistics from the Southern Jiangsu Daily, more than 120 people in the entire Southern Jiangsu area directly accused on the radio in these three days. 348 units requested to accuse or speak on the radio, totaling 1,292 people. More than 1,200 telephone calls were made from various places, and more than 2,200 letters were sent. More than 500 units presented flags, flowers, and money to the conference to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's troops and provide relief to Korean refugees. A spontaneous donation movement was also launched among the masses. The donations directly sent to the People's Broadcasting Station amounted to 288 million yuan. In these three days, the Southern Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station became the center of the people's accusation movement.

    This is a successful experience. It proves that the broadcasting station is a very important weapon in popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea education. According to preliminary estimates, at least 500,000 people listened to this Southern Jiangsu broadcast rally. The advantage of this propaganda form is that it is relatively easy to popularize. Wherever there are radio receiving facilities in cities or villages, as long as there is leadership, many people can be organized to listen. Listeners can immediately understand the overall situation of the movement in the region, which greatly encourages and promotes the movement. Secondly, it can widely mobilize the masses to go to the radio station to accuse and speak, educating the masses through the masses, making the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda more intimate and powerful with the masses' life experiences, and easier to inspire the masses' awareness. Thirdly, it is simpler than holding a large-scale meeting, saving the masses' time, and listening is more convenient.

　　一个重要的宣传武器
    ——介绍苏南人民反对美国武装日本的广播大会
    为着普及抗美援朝运动，各地应当创造各式各样为群众所喜爱的宣传鼓动形式。三月十七日苏南地区所举行的苏南人民反对美国武装日本的广播大会就是这种最好的创造之一。
    苏南人民广播电台组织的广播大会，连续开了三天，在全苏南各地人民中掀起了反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，控诉日本侵华罪行的新高潮。无锡市纺织业同业公会主任郑翔德就在广播电台诉述日寇摧毁了该市十七万纱锭的罪恶事实。离无锡五百多里远的宝山县人民也派了三个代表赶来控诉日寇在该县烧杀奸淫的血腥罪行。据苏南日报统计：整个苏南地区在三天内直接在电台上控诉的在一百二十人以上，要求到电台上控诉或讲话的单位三百四十八个，人数有一千二百九十二人，各地打来的电话达一千二百多次，寄来的信件达二千二百余封，向大会献旗，献花，献金来慰劳中朝人民部队和救济朝鲜难民的单位达五百个以上，群众中也掀起了自发的捐献运动。仅直接送到人民电台的捐款即达二亿八千八百万。三天内，苏南人民广播电台成了人民控诉运动的中心。
    这是一个成功的经验。它证明了广播电台在普及抗美援朝教育中是一个十分重要的武器。这次苏南广播大会收听人数，据初步估计至少在五十万人以上。这种宣传形式好处，第一是比较容易普及，凡是有收音设备的城市或农村，只要有人领导，均可组织很多的人去收听。听的人可以立刻了解全区运动状况，这样，便对运动有了极大的鼓舞和推动作用。第二、可以广泛地发动群众到电台上去控诉、讲话，通过群众来教育群众，使抗美援朝宣传同群众的生活切身体验显得更加亲切、有力，易于启发群众觉悟。第三、比开大会的方式简便，可以节省群众时间，收听也比较方便。
