　　Yellow River Spring Repair Project Fully Launched
    Patriotic Emulation Campaigns Unfolded Successively by Laborers in Three Provinces

    This year's large-scale Yellow River spring repair project has fully begun. More than 200,000 laborers from Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River have arrived at the construction sites successively since the middle of this month and begun repairing the dikes. This year's Yellow River spring repair project mainly focuses on strengthening the dikes on both banks and consolidating engineering structures such as dams and groynes on the dikes, with a total plan to complete over 16 million cubic meters of earthwork and 520,000 cubic meters of stonework.

    Before the start of the spring project, various locations along the river had made full preparations. After the completion of last year's winter repairs, staff members of the Pingyuan Province repair and defense offices and sections held various meetings in 70 percent of the villages along the Yellow River, widely publicizing the people's government's method of mobilizing laborers to contract for dike repairs and reasonable wage policies. Many farmers voluntarily signed up to participate in dike repairs. To ensure a timely start this spring, local governments began transporting large quantities of wage grain to various construction sites during the winter. Currently, the Party and government leading organs of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces have coordinated with the Yellow River Affairs Bureaus of the three provinces to organize a unified spring repair command to strengthen the leadership of the spring repair work. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has also organized Chinese and Western medicine doctors and medical personnel from the Yellow River Affairs Bureaus of various provinces to provide medical treatment for the laborers at the construction sites. Each work section in Henan Province is equipped with one or two medical personnel to collaborate with local doctors in leading the laborers in epidemic prevention. After the completion of the above preparations and before the start of work, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Yellow River Affairs Bureaus of various provinces dispatched inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections and supervise the spring repair project to proceed as scheduled.

    Due to the good preparation work, the laborers have been in high spirits since the start of the dike repair projects in various places, and have successively launched a vigorous patriotic emulation campaign. At present, the average amount of earthwork done by laborers in various places along the river is 4 to 6 cubic meters per person per day. A labor group of seven people in Zhongmu County, Henan Province, averaged 11 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. A labor team of more than 50 people in Pingyuan Province once achieved 16 cubic meters per person per day. Many labor groups are using mutual support to improve the collective work efficiency in order to complete the work as soon as possible. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The Yellow River dike near Wangjiazhuang in Lijin, Shandong Province, suffered a breach due to ice jams in early February this year. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and the Shandong Provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureau have jointly formed a breach closure committee, with Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Guo Zihua, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Shandong Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, as the director and deputy directors, and Jiang Yankun, Director of the Shandong Provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureau, and 18 others as members, to plan the breach closure project on the spot. At the same time, a breach closure command has been established at the construction site, with Jiang Yankun as the commander. Currently, the breach closure plan has been formulated, and the breach closure command is actively purchasing and transporting materials in preparation for starting work. The entire breach closure project is planned to be completed before the arrival of the flood season this summer. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　黄河春修工程全面展开
    三省民工相继展开爱国主义竞赛运动
    今年大规模的黄河春修工程已经全面开始。河南、平原、山东三省黄河中、下游沿岸已有二十多万民工于本月中旬先后到达工地，开始修堤。今年黄河全线的春修工程，主要是加强两岸堤防和巩固堤防上的坝、埽等工程，共计划做土工一千六百多万公方，石工五十二万公方。
    在春季工程开始前，沿河各地都曾作了充分的准备工作。平原省各个修防处和修防段的工作人员在去年冬修结束后，即曾在沿黄河百分之七十的村庄里召开过各种会议，普遍宣传人民政府发动民工包工包做的修堤办法和合理的工资政策。许多农民自动报名参加修堤。为了保证今春能够及时开工，各地人民政府在去年冬季即已开始将大批的工资粮食源源运到各个施工地点。现在，河南、平原、山东三省的党、政领导机关已协同三省的黄河河务局组织了统一的春修指挥部，以加强对春修工作的领导。黄河水利委员会并组织了各地中、西医及各省黄河河务局的医务人员到施工地点为民工治病。河南省的每一个工段均配备有一、两个医务人员协同当地的医生领导民工防疫。在以上准备工作完成后及动工前，黄河水利委员会与各省黄河河务局又分别派出检查小组，深入检查并督导春修工程如期进行。
    由于准备工作做得好，各地修堤工程开始以后，民工情绪异常饱满，并相继展开了轰轰烈烈的爱国主义竞赛运动。目前沿河各地民工平均每人每天所做的土工均达到四公方到六公方。河南省中牟县段有一个民工小组共七人，每人每天平均做土工达十一公方。平原省某民工队五十多人，每人每天曾做到十六公方。许多民工小组均以相互支援的办法来提高集体的工作效率，以争取早日完工。（新华社）
    山东省利津王家庄附近的黄河堤防在今年二月初曾因凌汛发生决口。现黄河水利委员会、山东省人民政府及山东省黄河河务局已联合组成堵口委员会，以黄河水利委员会主任王化云、山东省人民政府副主席郭子化及山东省财政经济委员会主任王卓如为正副主任，以山东省黄河河务局局长江衍坤等十八人为委员，实地筹划堵口工程。同时，又在施工地点成立了堵口指挥部，以江衍坤为指挥。目前，堵口计划业已制订，堵口指挥部已在积极购运物料，准备动工。全部堵口工程拟在今夏汛期到来前完工。            （新华社）
