Learn from Soviet Artists!
    —— Reflections on Soviet Propaganda and Satirical Paintings
    Zhong Dianfei

The excellent Soviet painters, inheriting the realist tradition of masters like Repin and Surikov, and the fighting spirit of Mayakovsky, have created many outstanding propaganda and satirical paintings in the struggle against reactionary forces at home and abroad, the fight to defend the sacred Soviet motherland, the struggle to realize Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan, and the fight for lasting world peace. Among these, 284 works, including many original works from the ROSTA Windows to modern famous satirical painters, have now been transported to China. Originally treasured in Soviet museums or currently being exhibited domestically, the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, at the invitation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers, sent experts to escort these works to Beijing, in preparation for an exhibition to be held in the capital in the near future. It can be predicted that this exhibition will help push China's painting creation forward. In particular, many propaganda paintings that are usually difficult for us to see will be of utmost importance in strengthening painting propaganda work in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

That is to say, Chinese artists will absorb the nourishment they need from this art exhibition.

What do we see through this art exhibition?

First, we see the painters' deep love for the Soviet motherland and their full fighting spirit. The painter Ivanov's "Drinking Water from the Dnieper River" (see illustration) is a painting full of unparalleled love for the motherland and rich in lyricism. The painting depicts a young Red Army soldier advancing to the banks of the Dnieper River, using his helmet to scoop up water to drink. The serene eyes and lips gently touching the helmet express the child-like pure emotions of the loyal Soviet children for the motherland that nurtured them. Zhukov's "Fight to the Death" depicts a Red Army machine gunner shooting at the enemy behind a bunker. On the wall next to him hangs a propaganda painting by Koletszky: "Red Army Soldiers, Save Us!" (This painting is also on display in this exhibition), which perfectly expresses that the Soviet Red Army understands who they are fighting for. In a painting by Kukryniksy, marked "We fight wonderfully and kill the enemy with all our might – Descendants of Suvorov, Disciples of Chapayev," the images of great historical heroes are set off behind several Soviet Red Army soldiers who are shooting at the enemy. This painting has simple colors and structure. But it deeply inspires the Soviet people and Red Army soldiers to respect the heroes of the motherland and to fight to the end to defend the glory of Russia.

In the post-war propaganda paintings, we see Biletski's "Dear Motherland, Accept This, It Is the Grain of Our Collective Farm." It depicts a woman from a collective farm, standing joyfully at the transportation station—the station is piled high with the grain they have harvested. Lamerov's "The People's Dreams Have Come True" uses the same painting-within-a-painting technique as Zhukov. The foreground depicts a grandfather and his grandson sitting comfortably on a ship, and other steamers can be seen sailing on the river outside the ship's window. Behind the grandfather is Repin's famous oil painting "Barge Haulers on the Volga," which depicts Russia's poverty and backwardness. Looking back on the past and thinking about the present, a sense of patriotism arises spontaneously. The so-called profundity of artistic thought is because the artist is good at capturing the major changes (class and social) in people's lives and expressing them with typical events and typical characters. The pain and happiness felt in the hearts of millions of people are expressed through images. Only in this way can art arouse the power hidden in people's hearts, and take action to defeat the enemies who dare to hinder their progress.

Second, we see the characteristics of so-called propaganda paintings. Propaganda paintings should clearly tell people what is good and what is bad; what should be done and what should not be done. They make people have clear loves and hates and clear thoughts. Therefore, it also plays a direct role in mobilizing and organizing the masses. In this regard, we can cite a large continuous painting made by Chernikh in the early days of the Patriotic War. The title of this painting is: "What Does Hitler Want?" It is divided into five pictures: "(1) To take food from the people; (2) To return factories to the capitalists; (3) To fill the land with coffins; (4) To turn free people into slaves." And the last and larger picture is titled: "For Every Blow, Three Blows in Return! Burn One, Return Ten! Get—Bayonets, Fire, and Bullets; Get—the End of Fascism (Death)." This should be a very clear exposure to those Hitler bandits who dared to break into the Soviet homeland. In post-war paintings, we see that in addition to depicting themes such as "We Defended Leningrad, We Will Restore It!" (Shevlov), the painters more specifically painted "Send Newspapers and Magazines to the Countryside" (Plavkina); "Milking Women Should Achieve High Milking Yields" (Chailinsky); "Collective Farm Members Breed Turkeys! Turkeys Are the Most Precious Poultry," and other paintings that specifically call on the people to engage in socialist labor for their own happy and fulfilling lives. All these paintings are very well painted. I only need to cite a propaganda painting by Biletsky, "Elections Are a National Holiday," to see how much enthusiasm the painter has for the subject he depicts. The painting depicts a Soviet female citizen, happily dancing, her strong and beautiful figure and wise smile are so full of vitality! How joyful and cherished is her sacred vote! I like this propaganda painting "Elections Are a National Holiday" more than I like Raphael's "Madonna and Child" and Titian's "Flora." This is not because Biletsky has achieved greater achievements in painting than Raphael and Titian, but because the content of this painting is closer to our lives, and the protagonist in the painting breathes and lives with us. Through her, I can even see the figure of the Chinese people moving forward, which makes me feel joy and happiness—happiness today and tomorrow.

Third, we can see that the mass content, the mass feelings, and the mass forms expressed in these paintings truly achieve a high degree of combination of content and form; this combination demonstrates the painter's sense of responsibility to the people and the seriousness of the work itself. Many of the paintings I have listed above have this characteristic. Among them, what deserves our special mention is Kashiev's "Breeding Fine-Wool Sheep." This style of painting is very similar to a specimen painting; the painter's purpose is precisely to promote this new breed of sheep among the people as a specimen, so it does not make people feel inferior in art. Shupina's "When There Are Good Nurseries in Collective Farms, Mothers Are at Ease and Children Are Happy" is a propaganda painting whose colors and composition are extremely similar to the Chinese "Calendar Poster" style. Biletsky's "Collective Farmers Breed Carp" is an extremely meticulous propaganda painting that is almost like a photograph, while his other painting, "Bring Michurin's Science to the Collective Farm Orchards," is actually a color photograph. The fruit trees and new apple varieties with a sense of reality prevent collective farmers from thinking that this is due to the artist's imagination.

In this regard, if Chinese painters can deeply understand this point, it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to us in further developing the performance of various plastic arts. Some of us believe that "single-line flat coating" can be accepted by the masses (this is correct); but we ignore that finely crafted "calendar posters" can also be accepted by the masses. Soviet propaganda paintings tell us: The most important thing for us is not the style of painting, but the subject matter and content it expresses. Therefore, today we are not arguing with "calendar posters" and old New Year painters about the transformation of painting style, but the transformation of subject matter and content. Only by standing on the latter point can we gradually and appropriately transform the painting style. Facts have proved that Chinese "calendar posters" and other old New Year painters have already begun to express new themes, and some of them are very well painted.

Secondly, regarding the part of satirical paintings, this art and its authors are relatively familiar to us.

The characteristic of Soviet satirical paintings is that they have a deep and clear understanding of current international politics, so they can "hit the nail on the head" in exposing the most essential things; at the same time, they are good at using the most familiar things in the lives of the masses as metaphors, so they are lively and easy to understand. We see that Ganf's "The U.S. State Department Seeks Collaborators" is full of comedic descriptions: these officials are searching for all kinds of reactionaries from the dustbin of history, reviving them, and then sending them into the State Department building; Yefimov's "Voting Machine" makes appropriate satire of those who regard the lives of hundreds of millions of people as child's play; a painting by Glivenko depicting "Traitor Tito" has Judas, who once betrayed Jesus, standing under Tito's portrait, and Judas says to the audience: "People all say I am Judas, please take a look and see who is Judas?!" Kukryniksy's "The Plague of War Is Coming" depicts Montgomery, who is spreading the plague, secretly climbing onto Norwegian territory. This "general," who once enjoyed a slight reputation in Europe, is now being driven by the White House to do evil deeds in the Scandinavian Peninsula.

Therefore, I feel that whether it is propaganda painting or satirical painting in this exhibition, the reason why it deeply touches our hearts and gives us strength is due to the painters' magnificent political spirit, their unlimited loyalty to the cause of human peace, their heartfelt love for the Soviet motherland, and their skillful and well-trained skills, so that an ordinary audience or a painter who shares their views cannot help but be impressed.

　　向苏联的美术家学习！
    ——苏联宣传画、讽刺画观后感
    钟惦棐
    优秀的苏维埃画家们继承着列宾、苏黎柯夫等大师们的现实主义的传统，继承着玛雅可夫斯基的战斗精神，在反对内外反动派及德国侵略，保卫神圣的苏维埃祖国的斗争中，在为实现斯大林战后五年计划及为全世界持久和平的斗争中，创作了许多卓越的宣传画和讽刺画。其中有二百八十四幅包括从罗斯塔窗到现代著名讽刺画家的许多原作，现在已经运到了中国。它们原被珍藏在苏联博物馆中或正在国内展览着，苏联对外文化协会应中苏友好协会总会及中华全国美术工作者协会的邀请，特派专家把这些作品护送到北京来，预备在不久的将来在首都举行展览会。可以预料，这个展览会将帮助中国的绘画创作向前推进一步。尤其是其中为我们平时所不易见的许多宣传画，对于加强抗美援朝运动中的绘画宣传工作，是有着极其重要的意义的。
    这就是说，中国的美术家们，将从这次画展中吸收他们自己所需要的营养。
    通过这次画展，我们看见了什么呢？
    第一，我们看见了画家们对于苏维埃祖国的深厚的爱，和他们的饱满的战斗情绪。画家伊凡诺夫的“饮第聂伯河水”（见插图），便是一张充满了对祖国无比热爱与富于抒情味的绘画。画上描写前进到第聂伯河边的一个年轻的红军战士，用钢盔舀起河水来喝。恬静的眼睛和轻触着钢盔的嘴唇，表现了忠诚的苏维埃儿女对于哺育了他们的祖国的稚子般的纯真感情。儒可夫的“殊死战”，是表现一个红军的机枪手在掩体后面射击敌人。在他身边的墙上，挂着一幅柯莱茨基的宣传画：“红军战士，救救我们！”（这幅画现在亦陈列在这次展览会中），它完满地表现了苏联红军明白自己是为谁而战。库克雷尼克赛的一幅标着“我们打仗打得棒，杀敌卖力气——苏沃罗夫的子孙，夏伯阳的子弟”的画中，在几个正在向敌人射击的苏联红军身后，衬着历史上的伟大英雄人物的形象。这张画色彩朴素，结构简单。但它却深深地激发了苏联人民和红军士兵对于祖国英雄的崇敬，为保卫俄罗斯的光荣而战斗到底的决心。
    在战后的宣传画中，我们看见了毕列坡尔斯基的“亲爱的祖国，收下吧，这是我们集体农庄的粮食”。画着一个集体农庄的妇女，喜悦地站在运输站上——站上堆满了他们收获的粮食。拉美罗夫的“人民的梦想实现了”，用的是儒可夫同样的画中有画的手法。近景画着一个祖父和他的孙儿安坐在轮船上，船窗外面可以看见江上其它火轮在航行着。而在祖父的背后，则贴着列宾的“伏尔加河上的纤夫”那张著名的描写俄罗斯贫困与落后的油画。抚今思昔，一种爱国主义的情感便油然而生。所谓艺术思想的深刻性，便是由于艺术家善于捉住人们生活中的重大的变化（阶级的和社会的），并用典型事件、典型人物来表现它。把千万人内心中所感受到的痛苦和幸福，通过形象，表现出来。只有这样，艺术才会激发起人们内心中所蕴藏的力量，而行动起来，去击溃那些敢于阻碍他们前进的敌人。
    第二，我们看见了所谓宣传画的特质。宣传画要明确地告诉人们：什么是好的，什么是不好的；该作什么，不该作什么。使人爱憎分明，思想明确。因而它也就在群众中起了直接的鼓动作用和组织作用。在这方面，我们可以举出契力尼在卫国战争初期所作的一张大型的连续画。这张画的标题是：“希特勒要什么？”下面分做五幅：“（１）要把粮食从人民那里夺过来；（２）要把工厂还给资本家；（３）要在土地上摆满棺柩；（４）要把自由的人变成奴隶。”而最后一幅较大的画，他题作：“每一次打击得到三次打击！焚毁一次还他十次！得到——刺刀、火和子弹；得到——法西斯主义（死亡）的结局。”这对于那些公然敢于闯进苏维埃国土来的希特勒匪帮，该是多么明白的揭露。在战后的画中，我们看到画家们除描写像“我们守住了列宁格勒，我们要恢复它！”（谢夫洛夫）这样的题材以外，他们更具体地画了“把书报杂志送到乡村去”（普拉夫金娜）；“榨乳妇要取得高度的榨乳量”（柴林斯基）；“集体农庄庄员们繁殖火鸡！火鸡是最珍贵的家禽”等，这样具体号召人民为自己美满幸福的生活而从事社会主义劳动的绘画。所有这些画都画得很好。我只消举出一张毕列索夫斯基所作的“选举是全民的节日”，便可以看出画家对于他所描写的题材，是寄予多么丰富的热情。画上描写了一个苏联女公民，她幸福地踏着舞步，健壮而美丽的身姿和智慧的微笑，是多么富于生命力！对于自己神圣的一票，是多么喜悦与珍视！我喜欢这张“选举是全民的节日”的宣传画，胜过喜欢拉费尔的“圣母子”和替善的“佛罗娜”。这并不是因为毕列索夫斯基在绘画的造诣上比拉费尔和替善有了更高的成就，而是因为这张画的内容更接近于我们的生活，画中的主人和我们共同的呼吸着和生活着。透过她，我更看见了中国人民在前进中的身影，使我感到喜悦，感到幸福——今天的和明天的幸福。
    第三，我们看出从群众的内容，群众的感情，所表现在这些画中的群众的形式，真正的做到了内容与形式的高度结合；这种结合，表现了画家对人民的责任心和作品本身的严肃性。前面我列举出的许多画，均具有这种特色，其中尤其值得我们提及的是卡希也夫的“繁殖细毛种的绵羊”。这种画风，极近乎标本画；画家的目的，也正是要把这种新的羊种，作为标本来在人民中推广，所以它并没有在艺术上使人感到逊色。舒平娜的“当集体农庄里有了好的托儿所的时候，母亲安心，孩子也幸福”，是一张无论在色彩与构图上都极其近似中国“月份牌”画风的宣传画。毕列索夫斯基的“集体农民们繁殖鲤鱼”，是一张极其工细的近乎照像似的宣传画，而他的另一幅“将米邱林的科学带到集体农庄的果园中”，则竟是一幅彩色照像。那具有真实感觉的果树和新的苹果品种，使集体农民们不致认为这是由于艺术家的臆造。
    在这方面，中国的画家们如果能够深刻地体会到这一点，对于我们进一步地发挥各种造型艺术的性能上，无疑是有极大好处的。我们有的人认定“单线平涂”能为群众接受（这是对的）；却忽略了精工细抹的“月份牌”亦同样能为群众接受。苏联的宣传画告诉我们：对于我们首要的事情不是画风，而是他所表现的题材和内容。因而我们今天不是向“月份牌”以及旧的年画家们争执画风的改造，而是题材和内容的改造。只有立脚在后面这一点上，才能逐步地适当地改造画风。事实证明，中国的“月份牌”及其他的旧年画家们，已经开始表现了新的题材，而且有些也画得很好。
    其次，关于讽刺画的部分，这门艺术和它的作者们，对于我们说来也比较的不算陌生。
    苏联讽刺画的特点，在于它对当前的国际政治有着深刻明晰的理解，因之它能够“一针见血”地揭露最本质的东西；同时它善于抓取群众生活中最熟悉的事物作比喻，因之它生动活泼，易于理解。我们看甘夫的“美国国务院找合作者”中充满了喜剧式的描写：这些大员们正在从历史的垃圾箱中搜寻各种各样的反动派，使之复活，然后送进国务院的大楼；叶菲莫夫的“投票机器”，把那些视亿万人生命为儿戏的人，作了恰到好处的讽刺；格里文科一张描写“叛徒铁托”的画，在铁托的像下站着当年曾经出卖过耶稣的犹大，犹大向观众们说：“人们都说我是犹大，请你们看看究竟谁是犹大吧！？”库克列尼克塞的“战争的鼠疫来了”，描写那散布鼠疫的蒙哥马利，正偷偷摸摸地爬上挪威国土。这位当年在欧洲曾经享有微名的“将军”，今天却正受着白宫的驱使，在斯堪的纳维亚半岛干着罪恶的勾当。
    因之我觉得这画展中无论是宣传画和讽刺画，它之所以深深地打动了我们的心，并给我们一种力量，乃是由于画家们那种雄伟的政治气魄，对于人类和平事业的无限忠诚，对于苏维埃祖国衷心的挚爱，以及纯熟地经过千锤百炼的技巧，使一个普通的观众或者和他们同道的画家，不能不为之折服。
