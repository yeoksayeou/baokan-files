　　Improving the Scientific Level of Book Criticism
    Kuznetsov
    Editor's Note: The issues raised in this article are equally important to our book review work. It points out that book reviews should have Bolshevik principles and a fighting spirit, and book reviews should not be limited to narration and annotation of books and periodicals, but should promptly reflect the questions that readers most urgently need answered. It points out that book reviewers must complete their tasks with a high degree of responsibility, and should not easily praise or criticize casually. Book review work "should have a high level of ideological and scientific level, and be closely integrated with the actual needs of socialist construction." This article was originally published in the sixth issue of "Reference Materials for Culture and Education," and we have made some necessary corrections.

    The journal "Soviet Book," edited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is a publication dedicated to criticizing books. The readers of this magazine include a wide range of Soviet scholars and intellectuals. "Soviet Book" conducts in-depth analysis work in every field of science, praises and promotes all progressive new books, and resolutely exposes manifestations of political indifference and bourgeois objectivism in books.

    This magazine is carrying out huge and necessary work, and in many cases, it has given real help to Soviet intellectuals.

    In the past two years, "Soviet Book" has published many substantive papers. The magazine has begun publishing summary interpretations of each volume of the Complete Works of Lenin and Stalin on a regular basis, and correctly pointed out readers' methods of criticizing certain books, such as P.M. Lukyanov's "The History of the Chemical Industry of Russia and the Chemical Industry," and I.I. Smirnov's "The Revolt of Bolotnikov" and other books.

    However, on the whole, this magazine has not been able to complete the tasks before it very well. Many book reviews in "Soviet Book" lack Bolshevik principles. It also carries the characteristics of one-sided criticism—only narration and annotation. Many articles published in "Soviet Book" have lost their fighting spirit. It avoids sharp, urgent issues that could excite our scientific public opinion, and only belatedly reflects on erroneous and insufficiently valuable works after critical articles have appeared in other publications.

    "Soviet Book" has not done enough in the departments of history and philosophy. The space of this magazine often overestimates erroneous books and periodicals. For example, the reviewer I. Zvavich praised I. Lemin's erroneous book "British Foreign Policy from Versailles to Locarno." I. Lemin made serious errors in his discussion of British foreign policy, interpreting the aggressive aims of British imperialism as a "defensive effort." The author of the book distorted the real reasons for the British interventionists' opposition to the young Soviet Republic, and he defended the crimes of Lloyd George, one of the main organizers of the anti-Soviet march, and the leaders of the British Labour Party.

    I. Zvavich not only kept silent about I. Lemin's toxic views, but deepened his mistakes in his review. I. Zvavich did not expose Churchill, Lloyd George, and the corrupt British Labour Party leaders—our country's most ferocious enemies who have always stood in the anti-Soviet camp—but instead clarified the question of "Lloyd Georgeites being better than Churchillites." According to the reviewer, this "better" "lies in the fact that the former has not inclined towards the adventurism of the latter, past and present..." (?!). N. Zubok's book "American Imperialist Policy towards the Caribbean Region, 1900-1939," written from an undisguised cosmopolitan position, also received excellent reviews in this magazine.

    Some criticisms in mathematics and physics have the characteristics of superficial appearance. Failing to reveal the methodological principles by which the books under review are constituted, the critics are limited to restating the content without giving correct evaluations.

    In his paper on M. Omelyanovsky's book "Lenin and the Physics of the Twentieth Century," B. Vor did not expose the errors in a series of propositions in the book. The critic did not point out that it failed to fully express the great significance of Lenin's genius works, and in many cases, he failed to point out the author's uncritical attitude towards Western bourgeois physics.

    We are completely unable to be satisfied with T. Kalinin's criticism of the first volume (tenth edition in 1949) of the textbook "Physics Course" by N. Kashin. One of the main errors of this textbook lies in its promotion of Kashin's anti-scientific argument, which is that in the process of nature, everything inevitably leads to a reduction in the value of energy, decline, deterioration of quality, and loss of the ability to transform further. N. Kashin wrote: "We are surrounded by processes of energy decay or dissipation in all directions." This argument logically leads to the idealistic theory of "the thermal death of the universe." The critic criticized a book, but failed to conduct his criticism around the philosophical defects and errors in the book.

    This magazine does not have a consistent principled policy on literary and language issues, and rarely criticizes Soviet literary and artistic works.

    Several valuable linguistic works have been published recently. However, the editorial department did not even notice several good books that have won the highest praise from readers. For example, the reviews of S. Makashin's special collection of papers "Saltykov-Shchedrin," Ye. Mozolikov's "Yanka Kupala" and other books and periodicals have not been published in this magazine. At the same time, it gives affirmative evaluations to a whole batch of erroneous books and periodicals.

    V. Vinogradov made serious mistakes in his review of A. Orlov's book "The Language of Russian Writers." The critic was pleasantly surprised by the author's "keen artistic sense, the sharp emotion of style," lacked the necessary analysis, and hurriedly published critical opinions. In A. Orlov's book, the language of the writer is considered to be separated from his worldview and his political cultural struggle. A. Orlov developed the erroneous theory of "the combined force of various languages." The significance of this theory lies in the fact that it believes that in the history of creating the Russian literary language, non-Russian national factors seem to have equally important significance as the Russian national language. The author of the book made formalistic mistakes, and essentially reduced the decisive role of the Russian language in creating the Russian literary language.

    The reviewer only casually argued about this most serious shortcoming in A. Orlov's creation, and did not point out the errors in his "theory." When discussing a chapter in the book where the author made countless mistakes, V. Vinogradov vaguely pointed out that "the leading role played by the Russian national mainstream was not noticed," and immediately believed that the characteristic of this chapter was "the extremely delicate and ingenious combination of the traditional view on Pushkin's language reform with A. Orlov's own particularly accurate new observations and wise comparisons (!?)."

    Not long ago, this magazine published an article by I. Sergeyevsky on the collection of essays "Kalinin on Literature." The critic's criticism of the editor was very minor, and "did not notice" the main methodological errors made by I. Yevondov when editing this collection of essays.

    One cannot study certain remarks outside of the content of all the papers or the entire speech. I. Yevondov, on the contrary, completely deleted them when he published these papers and speeches, mechanically extracting direct descriptions of literature from the content of the article. Some papers, according to the editor's opinion, underwent "surgery," and there were five to seven places in the collection where the quoted sentences did not match the original. I. Yevondov sometimes omitted the most important parts of the paper.

    "Soviet Book" praised the editor's irresponsible work without paying serious attention.

    Serious shortcomings also exist in the reviews of economics, law, art and other scientific departments.

    From this, it can be seen that "Soviet Book" has not been able to achieve a high level of ideology and a high level of science in our important and great cause—reviewing our scientific works.

    The editorial department of "Soviet Book" should take the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues and the instructions of the Party Central Committee that book introduction and criticism are "important weapons of communist education and propaganda" as the guide for its work.

    "Soviet Book" has major tasks before it. The editorial department must seriously transform its work to make the magazine a truly scientific critical institution. It is necessary to surround the magazine with a broad range of active writers, expand and improve the connection between the editorial department and readers. All articles in "Soviet Book" should have a high level of ideological and scientific level, and be closely integrated with the actual needs of socialist construction, and become a model for book reviews.

　　提高书刊批评的科学水平
    库茨涅佐夫
    编者按：这篇文章中所提出的问题，对我们的图书评论工作有同样的重要性。它指出，图书评论应该有布尔什维克的原则性与战斗精神，书刊评介不应该只限于书刊的叙述与注释，它应该及时地反映读者中所最迫切需要回答的问题。它指出，书评工作者必须以高度负责的精神来完成自己的任务，不应该轻易表扬，也不应该随便批评。书评工作“应当有高度的思想性和科学水平，并与社会主义建设的实际需要紧密地相结合”。本文原载“文教参考资料”第六期，我们作了某些必要的校正。
    苏联科学院编辑的杂志《苏维埃的书》，是专门批评图书的刊物。这个杂志的读者，包括广大的苏联学者和知识分子。《苏维埃的书》在每一种科学领域中，都进行了深刻的分析工作，赞扬和宣传一切进步的新书，坚决揭穿书籍中与政治漠不相关和资产阶级客观主义的表现。
    这个杂志进行着巨大而必要的工作，在许多情况下，都给了苏联的知识分子以真正的帮助。
    最近两年间，《苏维埃的书》刊载了许多内容充实的论文。杂志开始了按期刊载关于列宁和斯大林全集各卷的概括解义，并正确地指出读者对某些书籍的批评方法，例如：对普·米·卢基扬诺夫的著作《俄罗斯的化学工业及化学工业史》，对依·依·斯米尔诺夫的《波洛特尼克夫的起义》及其他书籍的批评。
    然而整个说来，这个杂志还没有能够很好地完成着摆在自己面前的任务。《苏维埃的书》上的许多图书评论，缺乏布尔什维克的原则性。它还带着片面批评的特征——只是叙述和注释。《苏维埃的书》上发表的许多文章，丧失了战斗精神。它回避着尖锐的、迫切的那些足以兴奋我们科学舆论的问题，对错误的和不充分有价值的作品，仅在其它刊物出现了批评的文章之后，迟迟地才有所反映。
    《苏维埃的书》在历史和哲学部门中所做的工作很不够。这个杂志的篇幅内时常过高地评价有错误的书刊。例如，评论家依·兹瓦维支，对依·列明所著《由凡尔赛到罗加诺时期的大不列颠对外政策》这本错误的书却大加赞扬。依·列明在对大不列颠对外政策的论述上犯了严重的错误，他把不列颠帝国主义的侵略目的解释为一种“防卫的努力”。本书的作者，歪曲了英国干涉者反对年轻的苏维埃共和国的真正原因，他辩护了反苏维埃进军的主要组织者之一的路易·乔治和英国工党头儿们的罪恶。
    依·兹瓦维支，不仅对依·列明的有毒素的见解保持沉默，反而在自己的评论中加深了他的错误。依·兹瓦维支不去揭穿我们祖国的最凶恶敌人——始终站在反苏阵营一边的邱吉尔、路易·乔治、贿赂公行的英国工党头儿们——反而阐明“路易·乔治分子好过邱吉尔分子”的问题。按照评论者的意见，这种“好过”，“过去和现在都在于前者没有倾向后者的冒险主义……”（？！）ｎ·祖包克以露骨的世界主义立场写成的《一九○○—一九三九年，美国对加勒比海流域国家的帝国主义政策》一书，在这个杂志上同样获得了极好的评价。
    在数学和物理学上的某些批评，带着肤浅的皮相的特质。未能揭露所审查的书籍借以构成的方法论的原则，批评家们只局限于内容的重述，未予以正确的评价。
    布·伏尔在其关于米·奥米连诺夫斯基所著《列宁和二十世纪的物理学》一书的论文中，没有揭发出这本书里一系列命题的错误。批评者并没指出其中没有能够完全表现出列宁天才著作的巨大意义，他在许多情况下没有能够指出作者对西方资产阶级物理学的无批评的态度。
    我们完全不能满足于特·卡拉宁对恩·卡申所著《物理学教程》第一卷（一九四九年第十版）这本教科书的批评。这本教科书的主要错误之一，就在于它宣传了卡申的反科学论断，就是认为在自然的过程中，一切无例外地必不可避免地导向能的降低价值，衰退，质量恶化，导向丧失进一步转变的能力。恩·卡申这样写道：“我们被各方面的能的衰退或者说它的消散过程包围着”。这种论断就在逻辑上导向唯心论的理论，即“宇宙热的死亡”。批评者批评一本书，但是并没能围绕着书中的哲学性的缺陷和错误去进行。
    这个杂志，在文学和语言问题上并没有一贯的原则性的方针，对苏联的文学与艺术著作很少进行批评。
    最近出版了若干有价值的语言学著作。但是编辑部甚至没有注意到已经获得读者们最高评价的若干好书。例如：关于斯·玛卡申的《萨尔蒂柯夫—谢德林》专题论文集，叶·莫佐利柯夫的《扬克·苦帕尔》及其他等书刊的评论，在这个杂志上并没有发表过。同时却给整批错误的书刊以肯定的评价。
    维·维诺革拉多夫对阿·奥尔洛夫所著《俄罗斯作家的语言》一书的评论犯了严重的毛病。评论家惊喜于作者“锐敏的艺术嗅觉，文体的锋利情感”，缺乏必要的分析，就匆忙发表批评的意见。在阿·奥尔洛夫的书中，认为作家的语言是和他的世界观，他的政治文化斗争脱离的。阿·奥尔洛夫发展了“各种言语的合力”的错误理论。这种理论的意义，就在于它认为在创造俄罗斯文学语言的历史上，非俄罗斯民族的因素与俄罗斯民族的语言，似乎有同等重要的意义。本书的作者犯了形式主义的错误，他在本质上降低着俄罗斯语言在创造俄罗斯文学语言上的决定性的作用。
    评论家只是淡然的论证着阿·奥尔洛夫在创作上的这个最严重缺点，并没有指出他的“理论”上的错误。论到该书作者错误百出的一章时，维·维诺革拉多夫隐约指出“俄罗斯民族主流所起的领导作用未被注意”，而立刻认为这一章的特质是“把关于普式庚语言改革的传统见解，和阿·奥尔洛夫自己的特别准确的新观察与明智的比较，极精致极巧妙地结合起来了（！？）”。
    不久以前，这个杂志上发表了依·谢尔基也夫斯基论《加里宁论文学》文集一文。评论家对编者的批评是很轻微的，并“没有注意到”依·叶闻多夫编辑这本文集时主要的方法上的错误。
    不可以在全部论文或整个讲演词的内容联系之外来研究某些言论。依·叶闻多夫却与此相反，当他发表这些论文和讲演词时，完全进行了删减，机械地从文章内容的联系中摘出些关于文学的直接阐述的地方。有些论文按着编者的意见，施行了“外科手术”，文集上有五——七处引用的句子与原文个别地方不符。依·叶闻多夫有时略掉论文中最重要的地方。
    《苏维埃的书》不去认真地注意一下，就赞扬了编者不负责任的工作。
    在有关经济、法律、艺术及其它科学部门的评论中，同样存在着严重的缺点。
    由此可见，《苏维埃的书》对我们的重要而伟大的事业——对我们科学著作进行评述——没能很好地达到高度的思想水平和高度的科学水平。
    《苏维埃的书》的编辑部，应当以联共（布）中央关于思想问题的决议以及党中央关于图书介绍与批评是“共产主义教育与宣传的重要武器”的指示，作为自己工作中的指南。
    在《苏维埃的书》的面前，摆着重大的任务。编辑部必须严肃地改造自己的工作，使杂志成为真正科学的批评的机构。必须使杂志的周围有广大的作家积极分子，扩大和改进编辑部和读者的联系。《苏维埃的书》上的一切文章，都应当有高度的思想性和科学水平，并与社会主义建设的实际需要紧密地相结合，成为图书评介的典范。
