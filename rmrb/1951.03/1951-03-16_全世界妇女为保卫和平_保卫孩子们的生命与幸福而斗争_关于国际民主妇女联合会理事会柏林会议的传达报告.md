　　Worldwide Women Fight to Defend Peace and Protect the Lives and Happiness of Children
    ——A Report on the Berlin Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council
      Lu Cui
     I. The International Women's Movement is Part of the World Peace Movement
    The Fourth Council Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation (IDWF) solemnly opened at 7:00 PM on January 31st in the People's Parliament Building of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin. One hundred and three women representatives from thirty-four countries across five continents attended the meeting. In addition, three to four hundred German women activists from East and West Germany and East and West Berlin attended daily as observers. After five days of reports and discussions, the meeting closed late at night on February 5th. This meeting was substantially different from an ordinary routine meeting; it was, in the current international situation, a world women's peace conference following the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, and its significance and tasks were very important.
    The characteristic of the international situation after the great success of the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw is the unprecedented intensification of the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war worldwide. On the one hand, based on the great success of the Second Congress and its concrete appeals in the declaration and the letter to the United Nations, the world people's movement to defend peace has unfolded more vigorously. The righteous action of the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the brilliant victories achieved by the joint efforts of the Chinese and Korean people, have severely hit the U.S. aggressors and inspired the confidence and courage of the people of the world to fight for peace, thereby further strengthening the world peace and democracy camp. On the other hand, the U.S. imperialists, having suffered major setbacks, still insist on their policy of expanding aggression and expanding war at all costs. They persist in their war of aggression against Korea while accelerating the rearmament of West Germany and Japan to revive these two major sources of war in Europe and Asia. They also direct the UK, France, and other vassal states to intensify their military buildup in preparation for a new world war. All of this constitutes a serious threat to world peace.
    What will be the outcome of the struggle between these two forces – the forces of aggression and the forces of peace?
    As the great helmsman of the world peace and democracy camp, Stalin, pointed out: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."
    That is to say, the future of the world depends on the people's struggle to defend peace. Therefore, "the broad movement to maintain peace...now has the most significant meaning."
    The international women's movement is an important part of the world peace movement. The declaration of the Second Congress of the International Democratic Women's Federation at the end of 1948 already pointed out: "Women of all countries! You bear a major responsibility to your children, to the people, and to the history of all mankind. If we, the women who constitute half of the population, rise up against the warmongers, a new world war cannot be launched."
    Therefore, the task of the Berlin Council Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation was to review the progress of the women's peace movement in various countries since the last Council Meeting, especially since the Second Congress, and on this basis, to discuss how to further expand the ranks of the women's peace movement and strive to implement the resolutions of the Second Congress, defend world peace, and protect the lives and happiness of children.
  II. Common Struggles on Different Fronts
    From the general report of the International Democratic Women's Federation at the Berlin Council Meeting and the speeches of representatives from various countries, we can clearly see that the vast majority of women around the world love peace and are actively engaged in the struggle to defend peace. Although these struggles have different starting points, different slogans, and different contents and methods according to the different situations of each country, their purpose is common, that is, to oppose aggression and defend peace.
    Korean mothers encourage their beloved sons to go to the front lines to bravely kill the enemy, while American mothers resolutely demand the recall of their sons on the Korean battlefield; Vietnamese women do everything possible to supply the People's Army with bullets, while French women lie on the tracks to stop the shipment of military supplies to Vietnam... These are common struggles on different fronts.
    Soviet women are always a shining example for women all over the world. The Soviet women's representative pointed out in her speech that they are working selflessly to build the great communist motherland and defend world peace. The early completion of the postwar Five-Year Plan is half due to the labor of women. Soviet women make up 48.3 percent of the total number of workers and staff nationwide, 50 percent of collective farmers, and 51 percent of specialists. It can be said that in the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural production, and on the scientific and cultural fronts, there is no sector in which Soviet women have not contributed their strength and wisdom. Soviet women deeply know that the stronger their Soviet motherland is, the more secure world peace will be. Soviet women enthusiastically participated in the work of the Soviet Peace Congress, actively responded to all the calls of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and closely cooperated with women from various countries to engage in the struggle to defend peace in all aspects.
    Women in the people's democratic countries have also made significant contributions to world peace. Taking Czechoslovakia as an example, women have shown a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm under the slogan "Building the motherland is strengthening peace," which has spread throughout the country. In order to welcome the Second Congress, various people's organizations issued one million "peace pledges." Millions of working people and women made pledges on the peace pledges for more than 13 million hours of shock work and more than 29,000 pieces of guarantees to improve work efficiency. Before the convening of the All-Czech Peace Congress on January 20th, two-person propaganda teams were widely organized, and most of the participants were women. Twenty-four of the 100 members of the newly elected peace committee were women, and the chairman of the national peace conference was Mrs. Hrdinová, chairman of the Czechoslovak Women's Federation.
    Women in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany also carried out extensive struggles to defend peace and oppose the rearmament of West Germany.
    Women played a significant role in the early completion of the Two-Year Plan of the German Democratic Republic from 1949 to 1950. Some female workers completed 180 percent of their tasks. In order to convey the resolutions of the Second Congress, 5,000 women formed propaganda teams and conducted door-to-door family visits. In order to welcome the Second Congress, the German Democratic Women's Federation grew from 450,000 members to one million.
    In West Germany, after Adenauer, the leader of the West German puppet government, announced the rearmament plan, 300,000 women wrote letters protesting to Adenauer. For several months, women and people in various parts of West Germany organized struggles against the rearmament of West Germany and for the reunification of the motherland through meetings, voting, surveys, and the collection of signatures. The German Democratic Women's Federation especially focused on conducting education work among housewives. In West Germany, they organized many women to fight against refusing to vacate houses for the occupying forces.
    The heroic struggle of the Korean people and women against U.S. aggression and to defend their motherland won the warm sympathy and support of women all over the world. Korean representative Heo Jeong-suk (许贞淑) denounced the shameless atrocities of the U.S. aggressors at the conference and introduced the heroic struggle of Korean women and people to defend their motherland and defend world peace. After she finished her report, the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia went on stage with tears in their eyes and hugged her. They unanimously declared their disagreement with their government's policy of aggression and demanded the withdrawal of their country's aggressive troops from Korea.
    The righteous actions of the Chinese people and women in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend their country have won the respect and gratitude of women all over the world. The speech of our country's representative on "Chinese Women Fighting to Defend World Peace in Response to the Call of the Second Congress" received warm applause from the audience. The U.S. delegation immediately telegraphed the appeal in her speech, which called on American women to refuse to be accomplices in the war of aggression, back to American newspapers. Our delegation has heard countless times from women representatives from various countries expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and Chinese women. They said: "Thank you to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, who used their lives to help the Korean brothers, defend their motherland and defend world peace; thank you to the Chinese mothers, who sacrificed their dearest husbands and children for the sake of defending peace. We will use all our strength to support you."
    The U.S. representative reported that on July 13th last year, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, 350 American women went to the United Nations to demand the withdrawal of American troops in Korea. From them emerged a new organization – "American Women for Peace Committee." It organized three large-scale demonstrations to defend peace last year, and constantly sent delegations to Washington to demand the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. The call of "Send our children home!" is increasingly circulating among American mothers. Mrs. Miller, whose son was besieged in Korea, published an advertisement in the newspaper, and within three days, more than 300 mothers in the same situation called her. They all telegraphed the U.S. Congress, firmly demanding the recall of American soldiers from Korea.
    People and women in capitalist countries and colonial dependencies have also carried out diverse and heroic struggles to defend peace under the rule of domestic and foreign reactionaries. Women in France, the UK, and other countries collect signatures, hold meetings, print and distribute leaflets and pamphlets, and send delegations to governments and members of parliament to issue calls protesting against the rearmament of West Germany. The struggle of the Italian people and women against the rearmament of West Germany and against Eisenhower's visit to Italy has resulted in bloodshed – the heroic peace warrior Grazia Buscemi sacrificed her life. Many Italian women broke through the blockade of armed police to mobilize dockworkers to refuse to transport military supplies, and supported the striking workers who refused to transport military supplies with donations and condolences. Brazilian peace warrior Elisa Branco was sentenced to four years in prison for holding a sign that read "Our sons will not go to Korea to fight" in a demonstration. In France, as the people and women launched widespread struggles against the war of aggression against Vietnam and against the rearmament of West Germany, peace warrior Anna Béthouart was acquitted, and peace heroine Raymonde Dien, who lay on the tracks to stop the transportation of military supplies, was also released early; the French government military court recently forced the release of twelve peace warriors, three of whom were women.
    It is thus apparent that women around the world have already done a great deal of work and demonstrated their courage and strength in the face of the warmongers. The French government announced a ban on the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation and two other international organizations (the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World Federation of Democratic Youth) in Paris precisely because it was intimidated by the rising tide of the peace movement. This does not indicate its strength, but rather its cowardice.
    However, the war group headed by U.S. imperialism has not yet abandoned its intention to invade and accept peace, but has instead intensified its preparations for a new war. For this purpose, they have carried out frantic war propaganda and spread all kinds of shameless lies to deceive the people. It cannot be denied that many women are still deceived by this war propaganda. Under such circumstances, our task is very arduous, and our work is not enough.
  III. Current Tasks
    Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, pointed out to us: "Between us and the imperialist warmongers is a race of speed. If we want to win, we must accelerate our work." She especially pointed out, "We must attract women in all countries who have not yet participated in any movement to participate in the active struggle for peace."
    Mrs. Popova, Vice-Chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation and head of the Soviet delegation, also repeatedly reminded us of our due tasks, that is, "to help every woman join the ranks of active and fearless peace warriors."
    The discussion on the agenda of the Council on expanding the unity of the international women's movement pointed out that in the current international situation, we have greater possibilities and necessities to unite the broad masses of women with different political views and different religious beliefs to fight together to defend world peace. The work of the member groups of the International Democratic Women's Federation in various countries proves that despite different political views and different religious beliefs, women are able to reach agreements in order to avoid the disasters of wars of aggression, defend peace, and protect children.
    The discussion of the Council on the third item on the agenda – strengthening and expanding the movement to protect children – shows that the threat of a new war has already aroused concern for the lives and safety of millions of children in the hearts of all honest people around the world. The atrocities of the U.S. aggressors against Korean children have angered all kind mothers around the world. They especially cannot help but think that if they do not rise up to stop the bloody hands of the war makers, then the same fate will befall their children.
    The words of Soviet representative Paphnova are sincere and moving. She said: "We, women and mothers, are responsible for the lives of all children – including white and black children, Korean and Vietnamese children, children in Paris and Moscow, and children in Beijing and London."
    Unite, defend peace, and protect the survival and happiness of children! This is the sacred duty of women and mothers all over the world.
    Based on the above discussions, the Council passed three resolutions, a letter to women all over the world, and a letter to women in West Germany, pointing out clear guidelines and tasks for the women's movement in various countries around the world.
    In the first resolution (on implementing the resolutions of the Second Congress), the Council ruthlessly exposed the criminal conspiracy of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States to launch a new war; but at the same time pointed out that war is not inevitable, because the warmongers have been opposed by huge peace forces. The success of the Second Congress clearly shows that the people of all countries are determined to take on the cause of defending peace. The Council emphasized the importance of the various resolutions of the Second Congress, unanimously supported the declaration of the Second Congress and its "Letter to the United Nations," and called on all member groups and all women to widely publicize them by adopting various methods, organize and mobilize the broad masses of women to actively support the resolutions of the Second Congress, and establish cooperation with various mass organizations to fight for the realization of the peace program of the Second Congress.
    The Council especially emphasized that all women who yearn for peace must do everything in their power to oppose the re-militarization of West Germany and Japan.
    Deeply recognizing that the international women's movement is part of the world peace movement, the Council instructed the Secretariat to maintain constant contact with the World Peace Council, and called on member groups in various countries to cooperate with the peace committees in various countries to actively implement all the resolutions of the World Peace Council.
    The Council decided to convene the Third International Women's Congress in early 1952.
    The second resolution is on the task of expanding the unity of the international women's movement. It pointed out that at a time when U.S. warmongers are threatening all mankind with a new war, the International Democratic Women's Federation faces a very important and urgent task, which is to expand the unity of the international women's movement and absorb the broadest masses of women in all countries around the world into the movement. For this purpose, the Council decided to continue its efforts to strive for cooperation with various international and national women's organizations on issues such as striving for peace and national independence, protecting family happiness, and defending the rights and interests of women and children. The Council suggested that member groups in various countries should establish contacts with various women's organizations that have not joined the International Democratic Women's Federation, organize joint actions to realize the program of the Second Congress, and carry out common struggles to defend the specific demands of female workers, peasant women, and housewives.
    The Council especially reminded the member groups of the International Democratic Women's Federation to pay attention to the implementation of the resolution of the Council in November 1949, which called for strengthening work among rural peasant women and female agricultural workers, more actively defending their economic and social rights, and attracting them to the common struggle of the working people against poverty and the threat of war.
    In the "Resolution on Strengthening and Expanding the Movement to Protect Children," the Council pointed out: The success of celebrating the first International Children's Day in 1950 in fifty-one countries under the call of the International Women's Federation clearly proves that the struggle to improve the fate of children can widely mobilize people from all walks of life, regardless of their social status, political or religious beliefs.
    Therefore, the Council decided to launch a broader movement on the 1951 International Children's Day with the slogans of eliminating the threat of war, protecting children's lives, improving children's situation, and democratizing education.
    The Council also proposed to convene an international conference to protect children in (September) 1951. This conference should widely absorb the participation of groups and individuals from all aspects.
    The "Letter to Women All Over the World" calls on women all over the world to fight more bravely in the ranks of peace, more resolutely support and implement the resolutions of the World Peace Council, and demand the immediate cessation of the war against Korea, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and let the Korean people decide their own destiny. It calls on every peace-loving woman to fight against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan by U.S. imperialism with all the enthusiasm, courage, and experience of a mother.
  IV. How Do We Implement It?
    These resolutions and calls of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation represent the common interests and urgent demands of women who love peace all over the world, and clearly point out the direction and specific path of women's struggle to defend peace and protect children. Undoubtedly, it will arouse widespread and enthusiastic resonance in the hearts of women and mothers in countries around the world, thereby promoting millions of new pro-peace women to participate in the practical struggle to defend peace.
    We Chinese women warmly welcome and fully support these resolutions of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation, because they are completely in line with the will and demands of our Chinese people and women to defend peace.
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation is one of the strongest member groups of the International Democratic Women's Federation; Chinese women enjoy a very high position in the international women's movement. Therefore, Chinese women bear a great responsibility for the implementation of the resolutions of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation.
    Following the Berlin Council Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation, the First World Peace Council Meeting convened in the same location further proposed plans for concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact and resolving issues such as Germany, Japan, and Korea through peaceful means on the basis of the Second Congress program, pointing out the specific ways and goals for the current struggle for hundreds of millions of peace-loving people, including women, around the world. The Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation has repeatedly called on us to resolutely implement the resolutions of the World Peace Council. We must respond to its call with practical actions.
    The joint notice issued this year by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and four other national people's organizations to commemorate "March 8th" (International Women's Day), the instructions of Comrade Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, to "further unite and educate the broad masses of women under the banner of great patriotism," and her speech entitled "Love the Motherland, Defend Peace" at the capital's commemoration of the March 8th festival are all completely in line with the spirit of the Council's resolutions, and are precisely the concretization of the Council's resolutions in China.
    We must conscientiously study and implement the above instructions, combined with the study of the documents of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation, further expand and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and oppose the rearmament of Japan, and closely integrate it with regular work. That is to say, we must further expand the unity of women from all walks of life, absorb all patriotic and democratic women into this movement, more widely and deeply mobilize women across the country, strengthen their patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education, truly make the idea of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea become a household name, known to all women and children, eliminate the remaining influence of imperialism in China, fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, help more Korean women and children, formulate and implement patriotic covenants; at the same time, strengthen contacts with women all over the world, especially women in Asian countries, oppose the rearmament of Japan by U.S. imperialism, closely coordinate with the struggle of the European people against the rearmament of West Germany. Support the movement for the Five-Power Pact, and conscientiously prepare for this year's June 1st International Children's Day and prepare for the International Children's Protection Conference in September – execute the resolutions of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation from all these aspects, smash the aggressive conspiracy of the U.S.-British war group, and strive to defend the motherland, defend world peace, and protect the lives and happiness of our children!

　　全世界妇女为保卫和平  保卫孩子们的生命与幸福而斗争
    ——关于国际民主妇女联合会理事会柏林会议的传达报告
      陆璀
     一  国际妇女运动是世界保卫和平运动的一部分
    国际民主妇女联合会第四届理事会议于一月三十一日下午七时在柏林的德意志民主共和国人民议会大厦隆重揭幕。来自五大洲三十四个国家的一百零三位妇女代表出席了会议。此外，每天有从东西德和东西柏林来的三四百位德国妇女积极分子列席旁听。经过五天的报告和讨论，于二月五日深夜闭幕。这个会议实质上不同于寻常的一个例会，而是在当前的国际形势下，继华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会之后的一个世界妇女保卫和平的会议，其意义与任务是很重大的。
    华沙二届和大以后国际形势的特点，就是和平与战争两种力量在全世界范围内斗争的空前尖锐化。一方面，在二届和大伟大成功的基础之上，在它的宣言及致联合国书的具体号召之下，全世界人民保卫和平的运动更加蓬勃地展开；中国人民抗美援朝的正义行动和中朝两国人民的并肩作战所取得的辉煌胜利，严重地打击了美国侵略者，鼓舞了全世界人民为保卫和平而斗争的信心和勇气，从而进一步加强了世界和平民主阵营。另一方面，遭受到重大挫折的美帝国主义者仍然不顾一切地坚持其扩大侵略与扩大战争的政策。它坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，同时加速重新武装西德和日本，以复活欧洲和亚洲这二个主要的战争策源地，并指使英、法及其他仆从国家加紧扩充军备，准备新的世界战争。这一切都构成了对世界和平的严重威胁。
    这二种力量——侵略势力与和平势力——的斗争究竟将达到什么结局呢？
    正如世界和平民主阵营的伟大舵手斯大林所指出：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    这就是说，世界的前途决定于人民保卫和平的斗争，此所以“广泛的维护和平的运动……现在具有最重大的意义”。
    国际妇女运动正是世界保卫和平运动的一个重要部分。一九四八年末国际民主妇联第二次代表大会的宣言就已指出：“世界各国的妇女们！你们对你们的孩子，对人民，对全人类的历史负有重大的责任。如果我们占人口半数的妇女起来反对战争贩子，新的大战是发动不起来的。”
    因此，国际民主妇联柏林理事会议的任务就是要检阅上届理事会以来，特别是二届和大以来，各国妇女保卫和平运动的进展情况，并且在这个基础上，商讨如何进一步扩大妇女和平运动的队伍，为贯彻执行二届和大的决议、保卫世界和平、保卫孩子们的生命与幸福而斗争。
  二  不同战线上的共同斗争
    从国际民主妇联在柏林理事会议上的总报告和各国代表的发言中，我们可以清楚地看到：全世界绝大多数的妇女爱好和平，她们正在积极展开保卫和平的斗争。这些斗争尽管根据各国不同的情况而有其不同的出发点，不同的口号，不同的内容与方式，然而其目的是共同的，那就是反对侵略、保卫和平。
    朝鲜的母亲鼓励她的爱子到前线去英勇杀敌，而美国的母亲则坚决要求召回她在朝鲜战场上的儿子；越南的妇女尽一切力量以子弹供给人民军，而法国的妇女却以卧轨来阻止运往越南的军火……它们是不同战线上的共同斗争。
    苏联妇女永远是全世界妇女的光辉榜样。苏联妇女代表发言指出：她们正在以忘我的劳动来建设伟大的共产主义的祖国与保卫世界和平。战后五年计划的提早完成，有一半应归功于妇女的劳动。苏联妇女组成了全国工人与职员总数的百分之四十八·三，集体农民的百分之五十，专家的百分之五十一。可以说，在苏联的工业与农业生产中，在科学与文化的战线上，没有一个部门没有苏联妇女贡献了她们的力量与智慧。苏联妇女深知，她们的苏维埃祖国越是强大，世界和平就越有保障。苏联妇女热烈参加了苏联保卫世界和平大会的工作，积极响应国际民主妇联的一切号召，与各国妇女密切合作，从各个方面来从事保卫和平的斗争。
    人民民主国家的妇女对世界和平也作了重大的贡献。以捷克斯洛伐克为例，妇女们在传遍全国的“建设祖国就是加强和平”的口号下，表现了高度的爱国主义劳动热忱。为了迎接二届和大，各人民团体发出了一百万封“和平约定书”。千千万万劳动人民和妇女在和平约定书上提出了一千三百余万小时的突击工作和二万九千余件提高工作效率的保证。在一月二十日召开全捷和平大会以前，曾广泛组织二人宣传组，参加的大部分是妇女。新选出的和平委员会一百名委员中有二十四位是妇女，全国和大的主席就是捷克斯洛伐克妇联主席贺地诺娃夫人。
    德意志民主共和国和西德妇女也进行了广泛的保卫和平反对武装西德的斗争。
    德意志民主共和国一九四九——一九五○两年计划的提早完成，妇女的努力起了很大的作用。有些女工完成任务百分之一百八十。为了传达二届和大决议，有五千个妇女组成宣传队，挨家挨户做家庭访问。为了迎接二届和大，德国民主妇联从原有的四十五万会员发展到了一百万。
    在西德，当西德傀儡政府领袖阿登纳宣布了重新武装的计划后，有三十万妇女写信向阿登纳抗议。几个月来，西德各地妇女和人民一起以开会、投票、测验、征集签名等方式组织反对武装西德和争取祖国统一的斗争。德国民主妇联特别着重进行家庭妇女的教育工作。在西德，她们组织许多妇女进行了拒绝给占领军腾房子的斗争。
    朝鲜人民和妇女反对美帝侵略保卫祖国的英勇斗争赢得了全世界妇女的热烈同情与支援。朝鲜代表许贞淑在大会上控诉了美国侵略者的无耻暴行，介绍朝鲜妇女和人民一起保卫祖国与保卫世界和平的英勇斗争。她报告完毕后，美国、英国、澳大利亚的代表一个个含着眼泪上台拥抱了她。她们一致宣布不同意她们政府的侵略政策，要求撤回她们的国家在朝鲜的侵略军队。
    中国人民和妇女的抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行为，获得了全世界妇女的尊敬和感谢。我国代表关于“中国妇女为响应二届和大号召保卫世界和平而斗争”的发言获得了全场的热烈鼓掌。美国代表团立即将她发言中要求美国妇女拒绝作侵略战争同谋犯的呼吁，用电报发回美国的报纸。我国代表团曾无数次地听到各国妇女代表表示对中国人民，中国妇女的衷心感激。她们说：“感谢英勇的中国人民志愿军，他们以自己的生命援助朝鲜兄弟，保卫祖国与保卫世界和平；感谢中国的母亲，她们为了保卫和平，献出了她们最亲爱的丈夫和儿女。我们用一切力量来支援你们。”
    美国的代表报告说，去年七月十三日，朝鲜战争爆发后不久，美国就有三百五十个妇女赴联合国去要求撤退在朝鲜的美国军队。从她们产生了一个新的组织——“美国妇女争取和平委员会”。它去年曾组织了三次大规模的保卫和平示威，并且不断地派遣代表团到华盛顿去要求美军从朝鲜撤退。“把我们的孩子送回家来！”的呼声越来越在美国母亲的口中流传。一位儿子在朝鲜被围的密勒夫人在报上登了一则启事，三天之内便有三百多个处境相同的母亲打电话给她。她们都打电报到美国国会坚决要求把美国士兵从朝鲜召回。
    资本主义国家和殖民地附属国的人民和妇女同样地在国内外反动派统治下进行了多种多样的保卫和平的英勇斗争。法、英等国妇女征集签名、开会、印发传单和小册子、派遣代表团向政府、国会议员，发出抗议武装西德的呼声。意大利人民和妇女为反对武装西德和抗议艾森豪威尔到意大利的斗争已经发生流血事件——英勇的和平女战士葛拉齐亚·布赛米献出了自己的生命。意大利很多妇女冲过武装警察的封锁，去动员码头工人拒运军火，并以募捐、慰问等行动来支援拒运军火的罢工工人。巴西的和平女战士依利莎·布兰柯因为在一次游行示威中高举“我们的儿子不去朝鲜打仗”的标语而被判处四年徒刑。在法国人民和妇女展开广泛的反对侵略越南的战争与反对武装西德斗争的情况下，和平战士安娜·北达华尔被宣判无罪，以卧轨来阻止运军火的和平女英雄雷蒙达·迪安也提早出狱；法国政府军事法庭最近被迫释放了十二位和平战士，其中三位是妇女。
    由此可见，全世界妇女已经做了很多工作，在战争贩子面前表现了自己的英勇和力量。法国政府正是因为慑于和平运动的日益高涨而宣布禁止国际民主妇联及其他二个国际团体（世界工会联合会、世界民主青年联盟）在巴黎活动的。这并不表示它的强大，而恰恰表示了它的怯懦。
    但是以美帝国主义为首的战争集团至今没有任何放弃侵略、接受和平的意图，反而变本加厉地加速新战争的准备。为此目的，他们进行了疯狂的战争宣传，散布各种无耻的谎话来欺骗人民。不能否认，许多的妇女至今还是为这种战争宣传所蒙蔽。在这样的形势之下，我们的任务是很艰巨的，我们的工作还不够。
  三  当前的任务
    国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人向我们指出：“在我们与帝国主义战争贩子之间是一个速度的竞赛。如果我们要赢得胜利，就必须加速我们的工作。”她特别指出，“我们要在各国吸引那些目前还没有参加任何运动的妇女来参加争取和平的积极斗争。”
    国际民主妇联副主席、苏联代表团团长波波娃也一再地提醒我们应尽的任务，即“帮助每一个妇女参加积极无畏的和平战士的行列”。
    理事会上关于扩大国际妇女运动的团结这一议程的讨论指出，在目前的国际形势下，我们有更大可能和必要来团结广大不同政见、不同宗教信仰的妇女，共同为保卫世界和平而斗争。国际民主妇联各国会员团体的工作证明，尽管政见不同、宗教信仰不同，妇女们为了避免侵略战争的灾害、保卫和平、保卫孩子，是能够取得协议的。
    理事会关于第三项议程——加强与扩大保卫儿童运动——的讨论表明，新的战争的威胁已经在全世界一切正直人们的心中引起对千百万儿童的生命与安全的忧虑。美国侵略者对朝鲜儿童的暴行激怒了全世界一切善良母亲们。她们尤其不能不想到，如果她们不奋起制止战争制造者的血手，那末，同样的命运也将降临到她们的孩子身上。
    苏联代表巴菲诺娃的话是真挚而动人的，她说：“我们，妇女们和母亲们，要对一切儿童的生命负责任——包括白种的和黑种的，朝鲜和越南的，巴黎和莫斯科的，北京和伦敦的儿童。”
    团结起来，保卫和平，保卫孩子们的生存和幸福！这正是全世界妇女们与母亲们的神圣职责。
    根据以上的讨论，理事会通过了三个决议、一个告全世界妇女书和一个告西德妇女书，对当前世界各国的妇女运动指出了明确的方针与任务。
    在第一决议案（关于实现二届和大的决议）中，理事会无情地揭露了以美国为首的帝国主义集团发动新战争的罪恶图谋；但同时指出，战争并非不可避免，因为战争贩子们已遭受到巨大的和平力量的反对。二届和大的成功明确地显示，各国人民坚决要把保卫和平的事业担当起来。理事会强调指出二届和大各项决议的重要意义，一致拥护二届和大的宣言及其“致联合国书”，并号召所有会员团体及全体妇女们采用各种各样方法来加以广泛宣传，组织与发动广大妇女积极支持和大决议，并与各种群众团体建立合作，为实现二届和大的和平纲领而战争。
    理事会特别强调指出，一切热望和平的妇女们必须竭尽全力，反对西德与日本的重新军国主义化。
    深刻认识到国际妇女运动是世界保卫和平运动的一部分，理事会责成书记处与世界和平理事会保持经常的联系，并号召各国会员团体与各国的和平委员会合作，积极实现世界和平理事会的一切决议。
    理事会决定于一九五二年初召开第三次国际妇女代表大会。
    第二个决议案是关于扩大国际妇女运动的团结的任务。它指出，在目前美国战争贩子正在以新的战争威胁全人类的时候，国际民主妇联面对着一个非常重要与迫切的任务，这就是：扩大国际妇女运动的团结，并且吸收全世界各国最广泛的妇女群众到运动中来。为此目的，理事会决定，要继续努力在争取和平与民族独立、保护家庭幸福与保卫妇女儿童权益等问题上，争取与各种国际的与各国的妇女团体合作。理事会建议各国会员团体要与未参加国际民主妇联的各种妇女团体建立联系，组织共同行动来实现和大纲领，并为保卫女工、农妇、家庭妇女等的具体要求而进行共同的斗争。
    理事会特别提醒国际民主妇联各会员团体注意实施一九四九年十一月理事会的决议，这决议号召加强在乡村农妇与农业女工中的工作，更积极地保卫她们的经济与社会权利，吸引她们到劳动人民反对贫穷、反对战争威胁的共同斗争中去。
    在“加强与扩大保卫儿童运动问题的决议”中理事会指出：在国际妇联号召之下，五十一个国家内庆祝一九五○年第一次国际儿童节的成功，明显地证明，为改善儿童的命运而作的斗争是能够广泛动员各阶层人民的，不论他们的社会地位、政治或宗教信仰如何。
    因此，理事会决定：以消除战争威胁，保护儿童生命，改善儿童情况及教育民主化等为口号，在一九五一年的国际儿童节发动一个更广泛的运动。
    理事会并提议在一九五一年（九月）召开一个国际保卫儿童会议。这会议应广泛吸收各方面的团体与人士来参加。
    “告全世界妇女书”号召全世界妇女更勇敢地在和平队伍中斗争，更坚决地支持与实现世界和平理事会的决议，要求立刻停止对朝鲜的战争，一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退，让朝鲜人民自己决定他们自己的命运。它号召每一个爱好和平的妇女都必须以一个母亲所有的热情、所有的勇气和经验，为反对美国帝国主义重新武装西德和日本而斗争。
  四  我们如何执行
    国际民主妇联理事会这些决议和号召代表了全世界爱好和平的妇女的共同利益与迫切要求，并明确地指出了妇女们保卫和平保卫孩子的斗争方向与具体道路。无疑的，它将在世界各国妇女与母亲们心中引起广泛而热烈的共鸣，从而推动千百万新的拥护和平的妇女参加到保卫和平的实际斗争中去。
    我们中国妇女热烈欢迎并且全力拥护国际民主妇联理事会的这些决议，因为它们是完全符合我们中国人民与妇女保卫和平的意志与要求的。
    中华全国民主妇联是国际民主妇联的最强大的会员团体之一；中国妇女在国际妇女运动中享有极高的地位。因此中国妇女对于国际民主妇联理事会的决议的执行负有很大的责任。
    继国际民主妇联柏林理事会议之后，在同一地点召开的第一届世界和平理事会议又进一步在二届和大纲领的基础之上，提出了缔结五大国和平公约以及以和平方式解决德国、日本、朝鲜等问题的方案，为全世界包括妇女在内的亿万爱好和平的人民指出了当前奋斗的具体途径和目标。国际民主妇联理事会再三号召我们坚决执行世界和平理事会的决议。我们一定要以实际行动来响应它的号召。
    今年全国民主妇联及其他四个全国性人民团体为纪念“三八”节所发布的联合通知，全国民主妇联主席蔡畅同志“在伟大爱国主义旗帜下，进一步联系与教育广大妇女”的指示以及她在首都各界纪念三八节大会上以“热爱祖国，保卫和平”为题的讲话，都是与理事会决议的精神完全一致，并且正是理事会决议在中国的具体化。
    我们要认真学习和贯彻上述的指示，结合学习国际民主妇联理事会的文件，更进一步扩大和深入抗美援朝反对重新武装日本的运动，并使之与经常工作密切结合。这就是说，要更加扩大各阶层妇女的团结，吸收一切爱国民主的妇女到这个运动中来，更加广泛深入地动员全国妇女，对她们加强爱国主义与国际主义相结合的宣传教育，真正做到使抗美援朝的思想成为家喻户晓，妇孺皆知，肃清帝国主义在中国的残余影响，全力支援人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，更多地帮助朝鲜的妇女儿童，订立和实现爱国公约；同时，在国际上加强与全世界妇女尤其是亚洲各国妇女的联系，反对美国帝国主义的重新武装日本，密切配合欧洲人民反对重新武装西德的斗争。拥护五大国公约的运动，并认真地来准备今年六一国际儿童节和筹备九月间的国际保卫儿童会议——从这种种方面来执行国际民主妇联理事会的决议，粉碎美英战争集团的侵略阴谋，为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平、保卫我们孩子们的生命与幸福而斗争！
