    Our fraternal nationalities number far more than nineteen?
    Errors exist in the "Nationalities Distribution Map of China's Provinces" from the Yaguang Cartographic Society

    To the Editors:
    In the "Map of the Provinces of the People's Republic of China" (compiled by Jin Qingyu, Ling Daxia, and others), published by the Shanghai Yaguang Cartographic Society in September 1950, there is a national distribution map. I think this chart is very inappropriate, and even has many errors. First of all, although there are no precise statistics on the number of fraternal nationalities in our country, it is known from existing materials that there are more than sixty. This chart only lists nineteen nationalities, and most of the nationalities are omitted, which is wrong. Secondly, although the Hui, Uyghur, and Kazakh nationalities all believe in Islam, they are not a single nationality. This chart states that the Hui nationality includes the Uyghur, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Kazakh nationalities, but does not include the Hui nationality itself, which is a great misunderstanding and error. I think that compiling maps so rashly will have a negative impact. I hope that the relevant authorities will check and correct this error, and print accurate maps showing the distribution of all fraternal nationalities.

### 我国兄弟民族何止十九个？亚光舆地学社中国分省图民族分布图中有错误

    我国兄弟民族何止十九个？
    亚光舆地学社中国分省图民族分布图中有错误编辑同志：
    上海亚光与地学社一九五○年九月出版的“中华人民共和国分省地图”（金擎宇、凌大夏等先生编纂）中，有一幅全国民族分布图。我觉得这个图表很不恰当，甚至有不少错误的地方。首先，我国兄弟民族现在虽没有精确的统计，但就现有材料所知有六十余个。这张图表上只列入了十九个民族，大多数的民族被遗漏了，这是不对的。其次，回族与维吾尔、哈萨克等族虽都是信仰伊斯兰教，但并非一个民族。这个图表上说回族包括维吾尔、达吉克、吉尔吉斯、哈萨克四族，反而没有回回民族在内，这更是很大的误解和错误。我认为这样草率地编纂地图是会产生不良影响的，希望有关机关检查并纠正这一错误，印制正确的全图各兄弟民族分布图。
