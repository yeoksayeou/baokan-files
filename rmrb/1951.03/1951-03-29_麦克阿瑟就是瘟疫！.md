MacArthur is a Plague!
	Zeng Wenjing

	The United States has always been the so-called most "civilized" country in the world, but now this "civilization" is in such a critical state that it has to beg for plague and other bacteria for salvation!

	The U.S. military's experience in Korea has been so miserable, which MacArthur did not originally expect. In order to save this game that is already certain to be lost, MacArthur Headquarters, through the Special Procurement Bureau of the Yoshida Government Prime Minister's Office, has ordered 1.5 million Japanese yen worth of liquid fat for culturing bacteria from Nishibetsuin Village and Higashibetsuin Village in Minamikuwada County, Kyoto Prefecture, in order to massively manufacture bacteriological weapons to poison the Korean people and the people of the world.

	This "civilized" measure of seeking help from plague bacteria makes MacArthur and his ilk the most brutal enemies of mankind.

	The United States has long been preparing to use bacteria to help them massacre humanity. In the autumn of 1941, the U.S. State Department specially established a bacteriological research institution, chaired by Mike. The institution not only maintained contact with relevant departments of the U.S. government, but also frequently exchanged information and researchers with Britain and Canada. In April 1943, a huge laboratory was established in Maryland. By June 1944, the laboratory had as many as 3,900 researchers, not including those from universities and private research institutions who were indirectly involved in the research work. Subsequently, field test sites were established in Mississippi and Utah, and a manufacturing plant was established in Indiana.

	However, bacterial warfare is not only an American "original idea," but also has "famous teachers" imparting knowledge.

	As early as 1936, Japanese Emperor Hirohito had secretly ordered the establishment of a bacteriological warfare unit. During World War II, this unit manufactured large quantities of plague, cholera, and anthrax bacteria, in quantities calculated in tons. They used thousands of living people as experimental subjects in Northeast China, and none of them survived; they also spread plague bacteria in Changde, Hunan, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. When Hitler fell, Japanese imperialism wanted to use bacterial warfare to salvage the defeat. However, because the Soviet Red Army swiftly eliminated the Japanese Kwantung Army, the base for bacterial warfare was cleaned up. During the Tokyo trial of Japanese major war criminals, the Soviet army repeatedly filed charges on this matter, but MacArthur still allowed the chief criminal of bacterial warfare, Hirohito, to remain the Emperor of Japan, and Lieutenant General Ishii was acquitted.

	The United States and Japan are both imperialists, and they are one family. If the younger brother gets into trouble, how can the elder brother not take care of him? Moreover, the bosses on Wall Street have long recognized bacteria as one of the "secrets" to realizing their dream of conquering the world, so how can they not inherit the mantle of Japanese imperialism?

	MacArthur is the initiator of bacterial warfare, MacArthur is a plague! Mankind has always been merciless in eradicating germs. Now, those who manufacture germs and create plagues to destroy mankind should be exterminated as cleanly as rats!

	The people of the world are incomparably powerful, and all bacteria can be eradicated. Bacteria can never save U.S. imperialism from its demise, just as it could not save Japanese imperialism from its demise.

	All people who uphold humanitarianism! All people who do not want mankind to be destroyed by germs! Rise up to stop this heinous crime of exterminating humanity! Rise up to support world peace, defend human safety, and use all actions to oppose bacterial warfare and oppose imperialism launching a third world war!

　　麦克阿瑟就是瘟疫！
    曾文经
    美国一向就是所谓世界上最“文明”的国家，然而现在这种“文明”竟危急到这样的程度，以致不能不乞求鼠疫等细菌来拯救！
    美军在朝鲜的遭遇，是这样的凄惨，这是麦克阿瑟原先意料不到的，为了挽救这个已经肯定要输的一盘棋，麦克阿瑟总部已经过吉田政府总理府特别调达厅，向日本京都府南桑田群西别院村、东别院村定购了一百五十万日圆培养细菌用的液脂，以便大规模地制造细菌武器，来毒杀朝鲜军民和世界人民。
    求助于鼠疫菌的这种“文明”的措施，使麦克阿瑟一流人物成了人类最残暴的敌人。
    美国老早就准备用细菌来帮助他们残杀人类。一九四一年秋季，美国国务院特别设立一个细菌研究机构，由麦克主持。该机构不仅与美国政府有关部门保持联络，并经常与英国和加拿大交换情报和研究人员。一九四三年四月在玛利兰州建立庞大的实验室。一九四四年六月，该室研究人员竟达三千九百人之多，各大学及私立研究机关受命间接参加研究工作的尚不在内。随后又在密西西比州和尤塔州成立野外试验场，在印第安那州成立制造厂。
    可是，细菌战争，不只是美国的“独出心裁”，而且还有“名师传授”。
    早在一九三六年，日本裕仁天皇就已经秘密下令建立细菌作战部队，这部队在第二次世界大战期间，大量制造鼠疫、霍乱和炭疽的细菌，其数以吨计算。他们曾在我国东北，用数千活人当作实验品，没有一个人留下性命；在湖南常德及长江下游亦散布鼠疫细菌。当希特勒垮台后，日本帝国主义本想用细菌战争来挽救败局，然而由于苏联红军神速地消灭了日本关东军，细菌战争的基地才被收拾了，在东京审判日本首要战犯时，苏军一再就此事提出控告，可是麦克阿瑟却仍让细菌战争首要罪犯裕仁做日本天皇，石井中将宣判无罪。
    美国和日本，都是帝国主义，都是一家人。老二闯了祸，老大那能不多多照顾？何况细菌一物，华尔街的老板们，早就看准了这是实现征服世界梦想的“秘术”之一，岂能不把日本帝国主义的衣钵承传下来？
    麦克阿瑟是细菌战争的发动者，麦克阿瑟就是瘟疫！人类对于病菌的扑灭，向来是毫不留情的。现在对于那些制造病菌、制造瘟疫来毁灭人类的人，应该像对待疫鼠一样，把它扑灭得干干净净！
    世界人民是强大无比的，一切细菌都可以扑灭的。细菌绝不能挽救美国帝国主义的灭亡，正如它不能挽救日本帝国主义的灭亡一样。
    一切拥护人道主义的人们！一切不愿意人类被病菌毁灭的人们！都起来制止这种绝灭人性的万恶罪行！都起来拥护世界和平，保卫人类安全，用一切行动来反对细菌战争，反对帝国主义发动第三次世界大战！
