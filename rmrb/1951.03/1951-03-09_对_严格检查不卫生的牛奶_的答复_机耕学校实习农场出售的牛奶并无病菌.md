Reply to “Strict Inspection of Unhygienic Milk”
    ——The Milk Sold by the Mechanized Farming School's Practice Farm is Germ-Free

Comrade Editor:

    After your newspaper published "A Reader's" letter on February 14th in the "Reader's Letters" section criticizing our school's practice farm for selling milk from diseased cows, our school immediately stopped supplying milk to subscribers and requested relevant health authorities to conduct a strict inspection of the cattle. The detailed situation is answered as follows:

    Our school's practice farm began raising more than 40 dairy cows in April of last year. On October 16th of last year, one cow died from piroplasmosis, and the autopsy revealed tuberculosis. Given the severity of this disease, we immediately requested the Department of Disease Prevention of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct tuberculin eye tests on the entire herd. The results showed that five cows had weak positive reactions, but all five cows were in excellent health. On December 19th, when a Soviet veterinary expert came to the school and was asked to examine the dairy cows, one cow had a cough. The expert believed it was suspected of having a weak positive reaction, but did not visually determine that "some cows have tuberculosis."

    After "A Reader" raised the issue, we immediately asked the Beijing Public Health Bureau to come for inspection. The inspection results stated: Your school's dairy farm facilities are clean, and the cattle are well-fed and managed. The five cows that showed weak positive reactions can be regarded as carriers or mild cases of tuberculosis, but because their nutritional status is good, they have no clinical symptoms of tuberculosis. It also stated: Bovine tuberculosis bacteria can be disinfected at 63 degrees Celsius for 10 to 20 minutes, or at 80 degrees Celsius or higher for 20 seconds. Most people in the city drink cooked milk, so there is little chance of being infected. We sent the milk to the Health Laboratory of the Health Bureau for testing, and the results proved that no germs were present. To be more cautious, we also asked the Veterinary Hospital of the Agricultural University to conduct intradermal injection tests on the herd. The results showed that only one of the five cows that previously showed weak positive reactions still had a reaction, and the other four had no symptoms at all. After various inspections, it was proven that the milk we sold was free of germs.

    Although "A Reader's" criticism contained many inaccuracies, it raised our vigilance. In the future, we will conduct regular inspections to maintain the health of the herd and ensure the safety of milk for all subscribers.

                    Mechanized Farming School of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

    Editor's Note: The Mechanized Farming School of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government attaches importance to public opinion, repeatedly strictly inspects the cattle herd, and temporarily suspends the supply of milk to subscribers. This serious and responsible behavior towards people's health is good. It is hoped that dairy farms in all regions will pay attention to the health of dairy cows and establish a regular inspection system to prevent the spread of diseases.

    The publication of "A Reader's" criticism, which was inconsistent with the facts, shows that our newspaper's editorial work still lacks in-depth investigation and research, which is what we should continue to pay attention to improving. At the same time, we also hope that all contributors will pay more attention to the authenticity of the content of their manuscripts.

### 对“严格检查不卫生的牛奶”的答复——机耕学校实习农场出售的牛奶并无病菌

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　对“严格检查不卫生的牛奶”的答复
    ——机耕学校实习农场出售的牛奶并无病菌编辑同志：
    贵报二月十四日《读者来信专页》发表了“一读者”对我校实习农场出售病牛牛奶提出批评后，我校即停止供给订户用奶并请有关卫生机关对牛群进行严格检查，今将详细情形答复如下：
    我校实习农场于去年四月开始饲养奶牛四十余头。去年十月十六日因患焦虫病死去一头，经解剖检查有结核症。鉴于此病之严重，即请中国科学院农业科学研究所防疫系对全牛群施以结核点眼检查，结果有弱阳性反应牛五头，但是五头牛健康情况均极良好。十二月十九日，苏联兽医专家来校，请其检查乳牛时，一头牛有咳嗽，专家认为有弱阳性反应嫌疑，并未以肉眼判定“有些牛有结核症”。
    经“一读者”提出意见后，我们立即请北京市公共卫生局前来检查，检查结果称：你校乳牛场设备清洁，牛只饲养管理均较良好，该呈弱阳性反应的五头牛，可视为保菌牛或轻症结核，但因其营养状况较好在临床上并无结核症状。又称：牛型结核菌在摄氏六十三度时经十分钟至二十分钟即可消毒；八十度以上时二十秒钟即可消毒，本市一般饮用者均为熟食，故很少有被传染机会。我们把牛奶分别经卫生局卫生试验所进行检查，结果证明无病菌存在。为了更慎重起见，我们又请农业大学兽医院对牛群做皮内注射检查，结果证明前次呈现弱阳性反应的五头牛中，仅一头牛仍有反应，其他四头全无病症。经各方检查证明，我们出售的牛奶是无病菌存在的。
    “一读者”的批评虽多有失实之处，但是却提高了我们的警惕性，以后我们一定经常进行检查，保持牛群健康，并保证各订户用乳之安全。
                    中央人民政府农业部机耕学校
    编者按：中央人民政府农业部机耕学校实习农场重视群众意见，一再严格检查牛群，并临时停止供给订户用奶，这种对人民健康严肃负责的行为是好的。希望各地奶场均应重视奶牛的健康，建立经常的检查制度，以防止疾病传染。
    本报发表了“一读者”的不符事实的批评稿子，说明本报编辑工作中还缺乏深入的调查研究，这是我们应该继续注意改进的。同时我们也希望一切投稿者更加注意稿件内容的真实性。
