Further Consolidate and Develop the Construction of the People's Capital

    Fellow Representatives:
    The year 1950 has passed. What exactly did we do during this year? Has the 1950 annual work plan we proposed been completed? I now, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, present a brief report to the assembly as follows:
    First, in the 1950 annual work plan, the first task we proposed was to continue consolidating revolutionary order and doing a good job in political power construction and judicial and public security work. Over the past year, our work has been successful.
    In terms of political power construction, because the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference effectively exercised the functions and powers of the Municipal People's Congress, important measures and important work of the Municipal People's Government have been discussed and resolved, and have been widely and deeply conveyed to the broad masses of citizens, which has enabled the government to maintain and strengthen systematic and close ties with the people. Precisely because the Municipal People's Representative Conference effectively exercised the functions and powers of the Municipal People's Congress, and the people's organization and level of awareness have rapidly improved, it is possible for our political power construction to move forward further. The election of the current representatives has largely adopted the method of election, and direct elections have been implemented as much as possible within the feasible scope. It can be said that this is another step forward towards convening a People's Congress through universal suffrage.
    Similarly, the experience of holding district people's representative conferences in urban areas has also been successful. All nine districts in the urban area have now held two meetings. The convening of district representative conferences plays an extremely important role in gathering public opinion, implementing government policies, and supervising the work of the government and cadres. We have reported on this at the Fourth Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, so I will not repeat it here. However, it must be emphasized that the second meeting was better and more successful than the first, and demonstrated the power of the people even more. Therefore, we believe that the next district people's representative conference can also exercise the functions and powers of the district people's congress. At the same time, after the land reform in the suburbs, all districts convened peasant representative conferences, and Districts 12 (Fengtai) and 16 (Mentougou) also tentatively convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life. Because the peasants' political awareness has greatly increased, it is possible to convene people's representative conferences from all walks of life in all districts and gradually exercise the functions and powers of the district people's congress.
    In addition, in order to strengthen the state apparatus of the people's democratic dictatorship, we established the Municipal People's Supervision Committee in June last year, and the Municipal People's Procuratorate in early January this year. The former has achieved success in its work and has handled 33 cases such as the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory explosion, with 21 cases currently being processed; the latter is also actively展开ing work.
    In terms of public security work, we resolutely implemented the policy of "combining suppression with leniency" and severely cracked down on all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Over the past year, a total of 225 cases of counter-revolutionary activities have been solved, including 29 major special agent cases, and 239 bandit cases have also been solved. The Yiguandao was completely banned, and 301 Yiguandao leaders were arrested; 238 members of reactionary party and团区 above the district branch level hidden in colleges and universities were registered. Counter-revolutionaries and bandits with heinous crimes have been sentenced to death according to law. As for general special agents and reactionary party and团区 members above the district branch level, they are placed under the control of the public security police station. Some of them have indeed expressed remorse during the control period and have been released from control. Some of them continue to do evil during the control period and have been arrested and will be severely punished.
    In terms of judicial work, the Municipal People's Court accepted a total of 19,631 cases throughout the year (7,948 criminal cases and 11,683 civil cases), plus 2,998 old cases from 1949, totaling 22,629 cases; a total of 21,625 cases were concluded throughout the year. After two concentrated efforts to clear backlog cases, improve work, increase efficiency, and establish district people's courts, the Municipal People's Court has gradually eliminated the phenomenon of backlog cases.
    The establishment of district people's courts is an important measure in judicial work. At present, three courts have been established in urban areas and one in suburban areas, and trial groups have been established in each district outside the district court. This has both facilitated the people and improved the efficiency of judicial work itself. Since its establishment in August last year, the district people's courts have handled a total of 4,870 cases by the end of last year. Among them, more than half were resolved through mediation, and the judgments in the cases were also relatively quick and appropriate, with very few appeals. Another important measure in judicial work is the transfer of prison management from the courts to the public security organs. Since its implementation, management and education have been greatly improved compared to the past.
    Due to our efforts in public security and judicial work, the social order in the city has become increasingly stable. Taking banditry as an example, the average number of robberies per month in the first quarter of last year was about 27, and thereafter, it decreased month by month. In December, there were no robberies in the city at all.
    In addition, we also conducted systematic struggles against all remaining feudal forces and imperialist influences. The land reform in the suburbs was completed before the spring plowing last year (detailed reports were given at the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference); gangster organizations such as "Loubao," "Houche," and "Luoche" have been banned; reactionary secret societies such as the Yiguandao have been destroyed. In particular, the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement has played a major role in eliminating imperialist influences. It has raised the people's awareness and promoted the unity within the people. This has made our people's political power even more consolidated.
    However, we are not without shortcomings in our public security and judicial work. Although we are not "unconditionally lenient" towards counter-revolutionaries, we do have the problem of not suppressing them in a timely manner. On the other hand, our public security and judicial organs are not doing enough to protect the rights of the people, and individual cases of infringing on the rights of the people have even been discovered, which we need to review and improve.
    Second, in the 1950 annual work plan, we regarded restoring and developing production as the overriding central task. Over the past year, the work we have carried out to achieve this task has achieved considerable success.
    First of all, looking at state-owned enterprises (including joint state-private enterprises): In 1950, new establishments included the East Suburban Flour Mill (joint state-private), the Chemical Reagent Factory, and the state-owned Construction Company reorganized from the Construction Engineering Office of the State-owned Enterprise Company. Equipment expansion included the New Flour Mill No. 1, Yanjing Paper Mill, New Glass Factory, and New Pottery Factory. The fine spinning section added to the Qinghe Woolen Mill is under construction (the Jingxi Coal Mine has been returned to the central government for operation). The construction and expansion of factories have not been fully carried out in accordance with the plan adopted by the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. This is because objective conditions have changed, and it is undeniable that we have shortcomings in formulating and implementing plans.
    In terms of investment, state-owned enterprises exceeded the original plan by 32 percent, of which 80 percent was used for capital construction. Public utilities exceeded the original plan by 33 percent. Therefore, the number of employees has also increased. The total number of employees in state-owned enterprises and public utilities increased by 38.76 percent compared to the end of 1949.
    In terms of output, major production units such as flour, woolen fabric, paper, and glass have exceeded the original plan. The average monthly output, except for lime and ice making, generally exceeded that of 1949. For example, flour increased by 61.7 percent, the main products of the Qinghe Woolen Mill increased by an average of 64.2 percent, paper increased by 98.7 percent, glass products increased by 83.2 percent, and bricks increased by 89.7 percent.
    During the production competition, the production efficiency of various factories has greatly improved. For example, the output of wool yarn at the Qinghe Woolen Mill in December increased by onefold compared to January; the New Flour Mill increased by 76 percent in December compared to January. At the same time, the quality of products has also improved. For example, the first-class product rate of the woolen weaving department of the Qinghe Woolen Mill was 49.6 percent in July, and increased to 95.4 percent in December.
    There have also been improvements in management. Production and sales are gradually becoming balanced, and the phenomenon of stockpiled funds has changed.
    The main shortcomings are insufficient experience in managing production, insufficient understanding of production and sales conditions, resulting in poor planning and failure to establish a sound economic accounting system. Some factories have not done a good enough job in democratic management.
    Secondly, looking at private industry and handicrafts: In 1950, the net increase in private industrial establishments in 21 industries was 1,621, with 5,534 employees, an increase of 32.2 percent in the number of establishments and 18.8 percent in the number of employees compared to the end of 1949; handicrafts also increased. According to incomplete statistics, the net increase in establishments was 1,129, with 3,345 employees, an increase of approximately 21.5 percent in the number of establishments and approximately 25.5 percent in the number of employees compared to the end of 1949; in addition, the net increase in specialized handicrafts was 676 establishments, with 2,114 employees. The total increase in private industry, handicrafts, and specialized handicrafts was 3,426 establishments, with 10,993 employees. Among these increased industries, the largest number of establishments are in the machine iron industry, smelting industry, weaving and dyeing industry, knitting industry, and chemical industry.
    At the same time, the number of machines and equipment in many industries has increased. For example, the number of single-style flour milling machines in the flour industry increased by 64.3 percent, the number of electric motors in the knitting industry increased by 48.42 percent, the number of 32-page printing machines in the printing industry increased by 25 percent, and the number of electric saws in the lumber industry doubled.
    In terms of output, most industries exceeded the level of 1949. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of production in 21 industries throughout the year reached more than 506 million jin of millet, exceeding 70.5 percent of the total value of production in 1949.
    Finally, looking at agriculture: The production plan we proposed to increase by 10 percent compared to the normal year's output has been completed and exceeded. On the one hand, it is because the entire land reform was completed in a timely manner before the spring plowing, which greatly increased the peasants' enthusiasm for production; on the other hand, it is because the government promptly used greater strength to help the peasants who had newly received land solve various difficulties in production. In the past year, agricultural loans totaling 5,428,876 jin of millet were issued, helping suburban peasants increase their livestock by 1,383 heads, waterwheels by more than 500, agricultural implements by more than 3,000, and add and repair 479 carts, and carry out seed selection and ditching and drainage work, leading and organizing peasants to fight against various disasters.
    With the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, commerce also developed in the past year. During the economic reorganization since March, the commercial sector experienced a temporary recession, and the number of business closures increased for a time. According to statistics, the net decrease in the first half of the year was 900 establishments. However, after June, due to our vigorous adjustment of industry and commerce, and due to the expansion of trade between urban and rural areas, it quickly turned to a prosperous stage. In the second half of the year, the net increase was 1,635 establishments, which means a net increase of 735 establishments for the whole year. In terms of turnover, according to statistics from the Municipal Tax Bureau on a part of the business tax collection, the turnover of general industries doubled in winter compared to spring. The development of commerce is the result of the development of production, but in turn, it stimulates and promotes the development of production.
    Our work in finance, trade, industry and commerce, labor administration, and cooperatives has also played a certain role in the development of production. In addition, our financial and tax work has also been successful. Because these tasks have been reported orally or in writing, I will omit them here.
    In addition to restoring and developing production, stabilizing prices was also a matter of great importance in the financial and economic work of last year. Since March, prices in the city have been basically stable. The total price index of 26 major commodities has only risen by 90 percent throughout the year; moreover, prices in December were even lower than in March. This is mainly due to the correct measures taken by the Central People's Government nationwide, and our various tasks in finance and economics have also played a considerable role.
    Third, in the 1950 annual work plan, we proposed to appropriately develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings to serve the working people. Our policy is to serve production and serve the working people. The specific plan in education work is to focus on developing social education (centering on the development of spare-time literacy schools), vocational education, and normal education. However, because there are still many children and young people out of school, school education has developed a lot in quantity. Municipal middle schools increased by 55 classes, and private middle schools increased by 48 classes, with a total increase of more than 9,200 students, exceeding the original plan by onefold. Municipal primary schools increased by 426 classes, and private primary schools increased by 14 classes, with a total increase of 21,440 students, exceeding the original plan by about sevenfold. Technical schools and normal schools increased by 15 classes, with an increase of 547 students. In addition, a workers' and peasants' rapid middle school with six classes and a cadre cultural supplementary school with six classes were established, totaling 12 classes. In general, middle and primary schools also gave special convenience to the children of workers and peasants to enroll. Among the new students admitted to primary schools, the children of workers, peasants, and revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and cadres accounted for 51 percent, and middle schools accounted for about 30 percent. Moreover, the newly established middle and primary schools are mainly located in areas with a dense population of working people and fewer schools. There have also been some improvements in the content of teaching. Judging from academic performance, it has generally improved compared to 1949. The ideological and political level of students has also improved significantly, especially during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the improvement of teachers and students in this regard has been more significant and widespread. However, if we say that our school education has greatly developed in quantity, then it is undeniable that the improvement in quality is still far from enough. This is what we need to continue to work hard on this year.
    In terms of social education, the first is to establish a large number of regular spare-time literacy schools. There are currently 49 schools with 31,472 students. If we add the worker literacy schools in various districts, the total number of students reaches more than 42,000, which also exceeds the original plan. Including the students in adult literacy schools, there are currently more than 50,000 working people participating in spare-time cultural learning. Cultural centers have been established in all urban and suburban districts, totaling 13, of which 4 are newly added. There are a total of 41 newspaper and magazine reading rooms, of which 34 are newly added. All have exceeded or completed the original plan.
    In terms of cultural work, the first is to establish a special administrative agency, the Arts and Literature Department, within the Bureau of Culture and Education to be responsible for leading and managing arts and literature work. By combining administrative management with mass arts and literature movements, uniting old artists extensively, and carrying out new arts and literature movements (such as the complete replacement of American movies by new movies and Soviet movies, the widespread performance of new songs, dramas, and folk arts, the spread of new music and fine arts, the improvement of old operas and folk arts, and the development of the people's broadcasting industry); by encouraging and commending good works that are beneficial to improving the people's political awareness and criticizing bad works, cultural activities in the capital have had a major impact on improving the people's thinking and awareness. It is particularly worth mentioning that our arts and literature activities have been able to face the working people, go to factories, and go to the countryside.
    In terms of health work, the original plan has been basically realized, and some tasks have even exceeded the original plan.
    Looking at epidemic prevention work, last year, more than 800,400 people were vaccinated against smallpox, exceeding the original plan by 60 percent; more than 87,000 people were vaccinated with BCG, exceeding the original plan by 9 percent; and a total of more than 424,000 people were vaccinated against typhoid fever, exceeding 1949 by 48 percent. In 1949, there were 225 patients with smallpox and 327 patients with typhoid fever in the city. Last year, there were only 11 patients with smallpox and 138 patients with typhoid fever. This shows that the number of major infectious diseases in the city has been greatly reduced.
    Looking at health and medical measures, we have established four health stations, one maternal and child health center, and five workers' clinics. They are generally located in areas with a concentrated population of working people. The original hospitals and clinics have also been expanded. A total of 614 new beds and 374 health personnel have been added. The unbalanced distribution of medical institutions before liberation has been initially improved. Moreover, in order to take care of the medical treatment of poor working people, municipal medical institutions have implemented free outpatient services, free hospitalization, and free delivery. At the same time, private hospitals are also entrusted to implement free methods, and the government provides certain subsidies. Last year, the number of outpatient visits increased by more than 180,000 compared to 1949, an increase of 41 percent; the number of hospitalizations increased by more than 1,600 compared to 1949, an increase of 29 percent. Among them, there were 172,276 free outpatient visits and 2,335 free hospitalizations. In addition, there were 239 free hospitalizations for difficult births, which appropriately solved the medical difficulties of poor working people.
    In addition, in order to strengthen the unity between Chinese and Western medicine, and under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, so that they can better serve the people, the study of practicing Chinese and Western medicine and midwives was organized to improve their awareness. As a result, with their active participation, 95 health care stations were established, and maternal and child health care networks were established in urban areas to assist the government in carrying out epidemic prevention and health care work.
    Health propaganda work has also been strengthened compared to 1949, and there has been progress in maternal and child health, school health, and industrial and mining health.
    Over the past year, there have also been some shortcomings in our work, such as there are still many cases of epidemic encephalitis, old-fashioned midwives have not been greatly transformed, and medical management work is not strong enough. In particular, municipal medical and health institutions cannot better serve the people because their institutions, systems, equipment, and technology are not very sound. Therefore, like education work, it has already developed in terms of quantity, but needs to be improved in terms of quality.
    Fourth, the achievements in municipal construction in 1950 were very significant. According to the original plan, last year's municipal construction was carried out around the two centers of improving environmental sanitation and improving citizen transportation. Because most of the work was completed in the first half of the year and has been reported at the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, I will only give a general explanation here.
    (1) Due to the dredging of the city's rivers and lakes, the repair and construction of many sewers, the construction of more public toilets and sewage pools, the strengthening of garbage removal work, and the improvement of tap water supply, environmental sanitation has been greatly improved.
    A total of 83,675 meters of old sewers were repaired and 36,422 meters of new sewers were built (including rain grate ditches). The Jinhe River, Changhe River, Moat, Tongzi River, Yudai River, Changpu River, Zhinu River, and the Three Seas, Jishuitan, Shichahai, etc. were dredged (the projects of Jishuitan and Shichahai were added outside the original plan), with a total of more than 1.7 million cubic meters of soil dredged. 108 new public toilets for men and women and 401 sewage pools were built. All of the above exceeded the original plan. And due to the adoption of work-for-relief and direct operation methods, a part of the funding was saved.
    In terms of tap water supply, the water quality has been improved (the number of tests has increased from 91 key spot checks in January last year to 638 general surveys in December). By the end of last year, the number of water users had increased to more than 35,300, an increase of more than 2,500 compared to 1949. By the end of last year, the water-using population had increased to more than 1.08 million, an increase of more than 450,000 compared to January last year, which also exceeded the original plan. In particular, tap water pipes were installed in the Mentougou mining area, so that miners can no longer drink the water discharged from the mines, which will greatly reduce the gastrointestinal diseases prevalent in the mining area.
    (2) Due to the construction of many new roads and dirt roads in many hutongs, and the maintenance of old roads, the improvement of transportation facilities, the construction of some new bridges and culverts, and the increase and improvement of the operation of trams and buses, citizen transportation has become much more convenient than before.
    In terms of roads, a total of more than 440,000 square meters of various road surfaces were built throughout the year, exceeding the original plan by 11 percent (including the larger-scale tree-lined avenue), and 919 dirt roads in hutongs were built (906 in urban areas and 13 in suburban areas, including 4 organized by District 16); a total of more than 570,000 square meters of old roads were maintained, exceeding the original plan by 70 percent.
    In terms of public transportation, the average number of trams operating daily in the fourth quarter reached 111.6 (up to 115), exceeding the original plan, an increase of 28.6 compared to the same period in 1949; the total number of passengers throughout the year was more than 48 million, an increase of 74 percent compared to 1949. The average number of buses operating daily in the fourth quarter was 85.8, an increase of 68 compared to the same period in 1949, an increase of 3.8 times; the number of passengers in the fourth quarter was more than 5.6 million, an increase of 5.8 times compared to the same period in 1949.
    (3) Housing is also a major issue related to the people's livelihood. In this regard, we have not done enough work. In addition to adjusting leasing relationships (a leasing agency is also set up under the real estate exchange) and mobilizing landlords and tenants to work together to repair houses to reduce collapses through the housing repair committees of various districts, we have also taken various measures to encourage investment in building more houses. For example, exempting property tax for three years, setting up a joint public-private real estate company to absorb idle funds to build houses, etc. In addition, more than 300 new houses were built; more than 2,300 old public houses were repaired. More than 1,300 houses confiscated from brothel owners have been allocated as workers' dormitories. However, the housing problem is still very serious. This year, we plan to use our strength to solve this problem.
    Fifth, preferential treatment work is one of the important tasks to consolidate the troops and enhance military-civilian unity. There are currently 19,153 households and 73,496 people in the city who are family members of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and cadres. Among them, the majority are poor. According to the preferential treatment policies of the Central People's Government, and according to the different characteristics of urban and rural areas, we have adopted a combination of代耕 or organizing production, introducing occupations, and material preferential treatment to help them solve their livelihood difficulties. 27 types of production have been organized, with 66 units, and more than 5,000 people have participated in production. More than 1,050 people have been introduced to employment throughout the year. More than 1,200 children of military families have been helped to enter schools. For the elderly, weak, women, and children who have no labor force, preferential grain is directly issued, and a military family nursing home has been organized to provide long-term care for elderly and dependent family members of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres.
    Our preferential treatment work last year was successful, but there were also shortcomings. Among them, the main shortcoming is that in the past, we did not widely publicize the preferential treatment policies to cadres and people throughout the city, and we did not do enough to carry out mass-based support the army and give preferential treatment to military families. In addition, when organizing production, we subjectively stipulated that 70 percent of the preferential grain should be used to organize production, which resulted in the preferential grain that should have been issued not being issued. This shortcoming has been quickly corrected.
    Relieving unemployment is also one of the important tasks in 1950. Because a more detailed report has been made at the Fourth Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, I will not repeat it here, but only make the following supplementary explanation, that is, by the end of last year, the cumulative number of registered unemployed workers and intellectuals reached 10,183 (including 2,000 temporarily unemployed miners). Among them, 4,569 have been employed successively. In addition, during the past year, a cumulative total of more than 22,000 households and more than 63,000 poor people in urban and suburban areas have received relief. 7,514 people have immigrated to Chahar and Suiyuan, and 351 people have been introduced to work as miners in Northeast China. A cumulative total of more than 2,700 beggars have been taken in.
    Summarizing the above-mentioned aspects of work, it can be said that the 1950 annual work plan we proposed has been completed, and has even been exceeded in many aspects.
    The reason why we have been able to achieve such great achievements is the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; it is also the result of the unity and common struggle of the broad masses of the people and us. The experience of Beijing's construction over the past year has once again proved the superiority of the people's democratic system. The people's democratic system is a system that truly conforms to the interests of the people and has a high degree of administrative efficiency.
    However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in our work. The sources of these shortcomings, in addition to some objective reasons, are mainly due to our cadres' lack of experience in urban work, their low level of business, or their lack of deep understanding of policies, and even their bureaucratic and commandist styles. Therefore, how to cultivate and educate cadres, and how to rectify and improve the style of cadres, has become one of our important tasks. To this end, in the past year, we have trained 520 in-service cadres in rotation by the Administrative Cadre School (in addition, 150 surplus personnel have been trained, and the vast majority have been introduced to work), and opened public security schools and other cadre training courses. We have adhered to the spare-time study system for in-service cadres. More importantly, we have carried out focused work inspections and comprehensive rectification campaigns. In the first half of the year, we successively inspected the work of six affiliated units of the Bureau of Public Health and the Bureau of Health Engineering, which played a certain role in improving the style of health workers and strengthening the leadership of health administrative agencies. In addition, some units have also conducted inspections of style and discipline. Two inspections have been conducted among public security cadres to oppose anarchism, lack of organization, lack of discipline, and to oppose commandism and corruption. The nine districts in the urban area have conducted inspections of cadre style through the people's representative conferences in various districts, and the suburban areas have rectified the ideological style of cadres twice before and after the land reform, which has achieved great results. In August last year, we formulated a comprehensive rectification plan and launched a comprehensive rectification movement among cadres. This rectification campaign is mainly based on summarizing work from top to bottom. Based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the policies and laws promulgated by the Central People's Government, the resolutions of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, and the work plan of the Municipal People's Government, we comprehensively reviewed the past work and展开ed criticism and self-criticism. Through this rectification movement, the cadres' policy level and business level have been considerably improved, the cadres' work style has been improved, the organizational structure has been adjusted, some necessary work systems have been established, and the unity among cadres has been enhanced. The experience of rectification once again proves that in our revolutionary ranks, criticism and self-criticism are the best weapons to push us forward. Periodic rectification combined with summarizing work should become our working system.
    The above is my report on the work of 1950, please review and criticize it, fellow representatives.

### 北京市张友渔副市长关于北京市人民政府一九五零年度工作的报告

专栏：更进一步巩固与发展人民首都的建设

    北京市张友渔副市长关于北京市人民政府一九五零年度工作的报告各位代表：
    一九五零年已经过去了。在这一年中，我们究竟做了些什么工作？我们所提出的一九五零年度工作计划是否已经完成？我现在谨代表北京市人民政府向大会简要报告如下：
    第一、在一九五零年度工作计划中，我们提出的第一项工作就是继续巩固革命秩序，做好政权建设和司法、公安工作。一年来，我们的工作是有成绩的。
    在政权建设方面，由于市各界人民代表会议有效地代行了市人民代表大会的职权，对于市人民政府的重要措施和重要工作，都曾有所讨论和决议，并向广大市民做了普遍而深入的传达，这就使得政府和人民保持和加强了系统的、密切的联系。正因为市各界人民代表会议有效地代行了市人民代表大会的职权，而人民的组织和觉悟程度也迅速提高，所以我们的政权建设就可能再向前推进一步。本届代表的产生，已经是绝大部分采取了选举办法，并且在可能范围内，尽量实行了直接选举。这可以说向着召开普选的人民代表大会又迈进了一步。
    同样，城区召开区各界人民代表会议的经验也是成功的。城区九个区到现在为止，都已召开过两次会议。区代表会议的召开对于集中群众的意见，贯彻政府的政策，监督政府和干部的工作，都有极大的作用。关于这一点，我们在第二届第四次市各界人民代表会议上，已有所报告，这里不再赘述。但必须着重指出：第二次会议比第一次会议开得更好，更成功，更表现出人民的力量。因此，我们认为下一届区各界人民代表会议也可代行区人民代表大会的职权了。同时，郊区在土地改革后，各区都召开了农民代表大会，十二（丰台）、十六（门头沟）两区并试行召开了各界人民代表会议。由于农民的政治觉悟大大提高，已有可能在各区普遍召开各界人民代表会议并逐渐代行区人民代表大会的职权。
    此外，为了加强人民民主专政的国家机构，我们于去年六月间，成立了市人民监察委员会；今年一月初，成立了市人民检察署。前者工作已获有成绩，曾处理了辅华矿药厂爆炸事件等案件三十三起，正在处理的二十一起；后者也正在积极展开工作。
    在公安工作方面，我们坚决执行了“镇压与宽大相结合”的方针，对一切反革命破坏活动，都给予了严重的打击。一年来，共破获反革命分子活动的案件二百二十五起，其中，有重大特务案件二十九起，还破获盗匪案件二百三十九起。彻底取缔了一贯道，逮捕一贯道头子三百零一名；登记了暗藏在专科以上学校的反动党、团区分部以上分子二百三十八人。罪大恶极的反革命分子和盗匪已依法处以死刑。至于一般特务分子和区分部以上反动党团分子则由公安局派出所加以管制，有些，在管制中确已表示悔过，已解除其管制，有些，在管制中仍继续作恶，已加逮捕并将严惩。
    在司法工作方面，市人民法院全年共收案一万九千六百三十一件（刑事七千九百四十八件，民事一万一千六百八十三件），连同一九四九年旧案二千九百九十八件，共二万二千六百二十九件；全年共结案二万一千六百二十五件。经过两次突击清理积案，改进工作，提高效率和建立了区人民法院后，市人民法院已逐渐消灭了积案现象。
    建立区人民法院是司法工作中的一项重要措施。现在，已在城区设三处，郊区设一处，并在区法院所在区以外的各区，都设了审判组。这一方面便利了人民；另一方面，也提高了司法工作本身的效率。自去年八月开始成立，到去年年底，各区人民法院共处理案件四千八百七十件。其中，经调解解决的占一半以上，判决的案件也比较迅速而妥当，上诉的很少。司法工作中的另一重要措施是把监狱的管理，由法院移交给公安机关，实行以来，在管理和教养上，已较前大有改进。
    由于我们在公安、司法工作方面的努力，已使本市的社会秩序日趋安定。举盗匪情况为例，去年第一季平均每月抢劫案约有二十七件，以后，逐月减少，到十二月份，城内根本没有发生抢案。
    此外，我们还对一切残余的封建势力和帝国主义的影响进行了系统的斗争。郊区土地改革已于去年春耕以前全部完成（在第二届第三次市各界人民代表会议上，已有详尽报告）；恶霸流氓组织如“搂包”、“猴车”、“锣车”等已被取缔；一贯道等反动会道门组织已被摧毁。特别是轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动在清除帝国主义的影响上，起了很大作用，它提高了人民的觉悟，促进了人民内部的团结。这就使得我们人民的政权更加巩固了。
    但是我们在公安、司法工作方面，并不是没有缺点。我们对反革命分子，虽不是“宽大无边”，但镇压不及时的毛病却是有的。另一方面，我们的公安、司法机关对于保障人民权利做得还不十分够，甚至还发现过个别侵犯人民权利的事情，这是需要我们检讨和改进的。
    第二、在一九五零年度工作计划中，我们是把恢复和发展生产做为压倒一切的中心任务的。一年来，我们为实现这个任务而进行的工作，已获得相当成绩。
    首先，就公营企业（包括公私合营企业）来看：一九五零年，新建立的有东郊面粉厂（公私合营）、化学试药厂和由公营企业公司建筑工程处改组成的公营建筑公司。扩充设备的，有新建面粉一厂、燕京造纸厂、新建玻璃厂、新建窑业厂。清河制呢厂增设的精纺部分正在修建（京西煤矿则已交还中央经营）。工厂的新建和扩充，没有能够完全按照第二届第二次市各界人民代表会议所通过的计划进行。这是因为客观条件有了变化，而我们在制订计划和执行计划上有缺点，也是不可否认的。
    在投资方面，公营企业超过原计划百分之三十二，其中，百分之八十用于基本建设。公用事业超过原计划百分之三十三。因此，职工人数也有所增加，公营企业和公用事业合计较一九四九年底，增加了百分之三十八点七六。
    在产量方面，面粉、制呢、造纸、玻璃等主要生产单位都超过了原订计划。月平均产量，除石灰、制冰外，普遍超过了一九四九年。例如：面粉增加百分之六十一点七，清河制呢厂各项主要产品平均增加百分之六十四点二，纸增加百分之九十八点七，玻璃制品增加百分之八十三点二，砖增加百分之八十九点七。
    在生产竞赛当中，各厂生产效率有很大的提高。例如：清河制呢厂毛纱产量十二月份较一月份提高一倍；新建面粉厂十二月份较一月份提高百分之七十六。同时，产品质量也提高了，例如：清河制呢厂毛织部一等品率在七月份是百分之四十九点六，十二月份增加到百分之九十五点四。
    在经营方面也有改进。产销渐趋平衡，积压资金的现象已有转变。
    缺点方面，主要是管理生产的经验不足，对产销情况了解不够，因而计划性很差，也还没有能够很好地建立经济核算制。有些工厂对民主管理还做得不够好。
    其次，就私营工业和手工业来看：一九五零年全年私营工业二十一个行业开歇业相抵，实增一千六百二十一户，职工五千五百三十四人，较一九四九年底户数增加百分之三十二点二，职工增加百分之十八点八；手工业也有增加，据不完全的统计，开歇业相抵，实增一千一百二十九户，职工三千三百四十五人，较一九四九年底户数约增百分之二十一点五，职工约增百分之二十五点五；此外，特种手工业开歇业相抵实增六百七十六户，职工二千一百一十四人。私营工业、手工业和特种手工业，合计共增加了三千四百二十六户，职工一万零九百九十三人。在这些增加的工业中，户数最多的是机器铁工业、冶制业、织染业、针织业和化学工业。
    同时，在机器设备方面，许多行业都有增加。例如：面粉业的单式制粉机增加了百分之六十四点三，针织业的电动机增加了百分之四十八点四二，印刷业的三十二页机增加了百分之二十五，制材业的电锯增加了一倍。
    在产量方面，绝大部分行业超过了一九四九年的水平。根据不完全的统计，二十一个行业全年的生产总值达五亿零六百余万斤小米，超过一九四九年生产总值的百分之七十点五。
    最后，就农业来看：我们所提出的较常年产量增加一成的生产计划已经完成，并已超过。一方面，是由于在春耕以前及时完成了全部土地改革，使农民的生产情绪大大地提高；另一方面，是由于政府及时地以较大的力量帮助新分到土地的农民解决了生产上的各种困难。在去年一年中，发放农业贷款共五百四十二万八千八百七十六斤小米，帮助郊区农民增加了牲畜一千三百八十三头，水车五百余辆，农具三千余件，添置和修理大车四百七十九辆，并进行了选种和挖沟排水工作，领导并组织农民和各种灾害进行了斗争。
    随着工业和农业生产的恢复和发展，商业在去年一年中也是发展的。在三月以来的经济改组过程中，商业方面曾经表现了暂时的萧条，歇业一度增多，据统计，前半年开歇业相抵，实际减少了九百户。但是六月以后，由于我们大力调整工商业的结果，由于城乡贸易的扩大，很快就转入了繁荣阶段，后半年，开歇业相抵，实际增加了一千六百三十五户，也就是全年实际增加了七百三十五户。在营业额方面，根据市税务局征收营业税的一部分材料统计，一般行业的营业额，冬季比春季增加了一倍。商业的发展是生产发展的结果，但反转来，它又刺激和促进了生产的发展。
    我们在金融、贸易、工商、劳动行政以及合作社等方面的工作，对于生产的发展也起了一定作用。另外，我们的财政税收工作也是有成绩的。因为这些工作已另有口头的或书面的报告，我在这里就省略不提了。
    在恢复和发展生产以外，稳定物价也是去年财经工作中，具有极重要意义的一件事。从三月份以来，本市的物价基本上是稳定的，二十六种主要商品的物价总指数全年仅上涨了百分之九十；而且，十二月份的物价还比三月份低。这主要是由于中央人民政府在全国范围内，采取了正确的措施，而我们在财经方面的各项工作也起了相当作用。
    第三、在一九五○年度工作计划中，我们曾提出适当发展为劳动人民服务的文教卫生事业。我们的方针是为生产服务，为劳动人民服务。具体计划，在教育工作方面，是以发展社会教育（中心是发展业余补习学校）、职业教育和师范教育为重点。但因失学的儿童和青年还很多，所以在学校教育方面，在数量上发展了很多。市立中学增加了五十五班，私立中学增加了四十八班，共增加学生九千二百余人，超过原订计划一倍。市立小学增加了四百二十六班，私立小学增加了十四班，共增加学生二万一千四百四十人，超过原订计划约七倍。技术学校和师范学校共增加十五班，增加学生五百四十七人。另外，还建立了工农速成中学一所，六班；干部文化补习学校一所，六班，合计十二班。一般中、小学在招生时也特别给工农子弟以入学的便利，小学录取的新生当中，工农和烈、军、干属子弟占百分之五十一，中学约占百分之三十。并且，新增设的中小学，主要是设在劳动人民密集而学校较少的地区。在教学的内容方面也有一些改进，就课业成绩看，一般地较一九四九年提高了。学生的思想、政治水平也有显著的提高，特别是在抗美援朝运动当中，教员和学生在这方面的提高，更加显著和普遍。但是，如果说，我们的学校教育在量上，有了很大的发展，那么，不可否认，在质上的改进，却还很不够。这是我们今年需要继续努力的。
    在社会教育方面，首先是大量设立正规的业余补习学校，现有四十九校，学生三万一千四百七十二人，如果加上各区的工人补习学校，则学生共达四万二千余人，也超过了原订计划。连成人补习学校学生计算在内，则现有五万多劳动人民参加业余文化学习。文化馆在城郊各区都已建立，共十三处，其中，新增的四处。书报阅览室共达四十一处，其中，新增的三十四处。都超过或完成了原订计划。
    在文化工作方面，首先，是在文教局内设立了一个专门的行政机构即文艺处，来负责领导和管理文艺工作。由于把行政管理工作和群众性的文艺运动配合起来，广泛地团结了旧艺人，开展了新文艺运动（例如新的电影和苏联电影完全代替了美国的电影，新的歌曲、话剧、曲艺的广泛演出，新的音乐、美术的传播，旧剧、旧曲艺的改良，人民广播事业的发展）；由于对好的，有益于提高人民政治觉悟的各种作品的鼓励和表扬，对坏的作品的批评，已经使首都的文化活动对人民的思想和觉悟的提高，发生了重大的影响。特别值得提到的，是我们的文艺活动，已能面向劳动人民，下工厂，到农村。
    在卫生工作方面，原订计划已基本实现，有些工作并超过了原订计划。
    就防疫工作看，去年一年，接种牛痘八十万零四千余人，超过原订计划百分之六十；卡介苗接种八万七千余人，超过原订计划百分之九；伤寒预防注射共做了四十二万四千余人次，超过一九四九年百分之四十八。一九四九年本市天花患者是二百二十五人，伤寒患者是三百二十七人，去年则仅有天花患者十一人，伤寒患者一百三十八人。这说明本市主要传染病的数字已大为减少。
    就卫生医疗措施来看，我们曾建立卫生所四处，妇幼保健所一处，工人诊疗所五处。一般都增设在劳动人民集中的地区。原有各院所，也有所扩大。总计新增了病床六百一十四张，卫生人员三百七十四人。解放前，医疗机构分布不平衡的状态，已获得初步改善。并且，为了照顾贫苦劳动人民疾病的医疗，市立医疗机构实行了免费门诊、免费住院和免费接生等办法。同时，并委托私人医院也实行免费办法，由政府给以一定补助。去年一年门诊人数较一九四九年增加了十八万余人，即增加了百分之四十一；住院人数较一九四九年增加了一千六百余人，即增加了百分之二十九。其中，免费门诊十七万二千二百七十六人次，免费住院二千三百三十五人。另外，还有难产免费住院二百三十九人，适当解决了贫苦劳动人民的医疗困难。
    此外，为了加强对中、西医的团结，在公私兼顾的原则下，使能更好地为人民服务，组织了开业中、西医和助产士的学习，提高他们的觉悟，因而在他们积极参加之下，建立了卫生保健站九十五处，城区都成立了妇幼保健工作网，协助政府进行防疫保健工作。
    卫生宣传工作，也较一九四九年加强，在妇幼卫生、学校卫生、工矿卫生各方面，都有进步。
    一年来，工作中也有一些缺点，如流行性脑炎仍然很多，旧式接生婆还未得到大量改造，医药管理工作还不够强，特别是市立医疗卫生机关由于机构、制度、设备、技术等都不很健全，还不能更好地为人民服务。因此，和教育工作一样，也是在量的方面已有发展，而在质的方面尚待改进。
    第四、一九五零年度市政建设方面的成绩是很显著的。按照原订计划，去年的市政建设是围绕着改善环境卫生和改善市民交通两个中心来进行的。因为其中大部分工作在前半年即已完成，并已在第二届第三次市各界人民代表会议上做过报告，所以这里只作一个概括的说明。
    （一）由于疏浚了全市的河湖，掏修和新建了不少的下水道，增建了男女公共厕所、秽水池，加强了清除垃圾的工作，改善了自来水的供应，环境卫生是大大改善了。
    总计掏修了旧下水道八万三千六百七十五公尺，新建下水道三万六千四百二十二公尺（包括雨水口沟线）。疏浚了金河、长河、护城河、筒子河、玉带河、菖蒲河、织女河以及三海、积水潭、什刹海等（积水潭、什刹海的工程都是在原订计划之外增加的），共浚土一百七十余万方。增建了男女公共厕所一百零八座，秽水池四百零一座。以上各项都超过了原订计划。并由于采取了以工代赈和直接经营的方式，节省了一部分经费。
    在自来水的供应方面，水质已经改善（化验次数由去年一月重点抽查九十一次，增到十二月普查六百三十八次）。用水户到去年年底已增到三万五千三百余户，比一九四九年增加了二千五百余户，用水人口到去年年底，已增到一百零八万余人，比去年一月增加了四十五万余人，也超过了原订计划。特别是门头沟矿区按装了自来水管，使矿工们从此可以不再吃矿井排出来的水，将大大减少在矿区流行的肠胃病。
    （二）由于修建了许多新的道路和许多胡同的土路，并对旧路进行了保养，改进了交通设施，增建了一些桥梁涵洞，增加并改善了电车和公共汽车的行驶，因而使市民的交通比以前便利得多了。
    道路方面，全年共修建了各种路面四十四万余平方公尺，超过原订计划百分之十一（其中，包括规模较大的林荫大道），修了九百一十九条胡同的土路（城区九百零六条，郊区十三条，内有十六区主办的四条）；保养旧路共五十七万余平方公尺，超过原订计划百分之七十。
    公共交通方面，电车第四季每日平均出车已达一百一十一点六辆（最高达一百一十五辆），超过了原订计划，比一九四九年同期增加二十八点六辆；全年乘客总人数四千八百余万人，比一九四九年增加百分之七十四。公共汽车第四季每日平均出车八十五点八辆，比一九四九年同期增加了六十八辆，即增加了三点八倍；第四期乘客人数五百六十万余人，比一九四九年同期增加五点八倍。
    （三）房屋问题也是关系人民生活较大的一个问题。在这方面，我们的工作还做得很不够。我们除了调整租赁关系（在房地产交易所下并设有租赁介绍所一处），并通过各区的房屋修缮委员会，动员房东、房客协力修房以减少倒塌外，还采取了各种办法鼓励投资增建房屋。例如三年内免征房产税，筹设公私合营的房产公司吸收游资建房等。另外，还新建了房屋三百余间；修缮了旧公有房屋二千三百余所。没收妓院老板的房屋一千三百余间，已拨作工人宿舍。但是，房屋问题还很严重。今年，我们准备用大力来解决这一问题。
    第五、优抚工作是巩固部队和增强军民团结的重要工作之一。本市现有烈士家属，革命军人和干部家属共一万九千一百五十三户，七万三千四百九十六人。其中，贫苦的占多数。我们根据中央人民政府的优抚政策，按照城乡不同的特点，分别采取了代耕或组织生产、介绍职业和实物优待相结合的方针来帮助他们解决生活上的困难。已经组织起来的生产有二十七种，六十六个单位，参加生产的已有五千余人。全年介绍就业的一千零五十余人。帮助军属子弟一千二百余人进了学校。对于老弱妇孺，无劳动力的则直接发给优待粮，并组织了军属安老所一处，长期收养年老无依的烈、军、干属。
    我们去年的优抚工作是有成绩的，但也有缺点。其中，主要的缺点是过去对全市的干部和人民广泛地宣传优抚政策，开展群众性的拥军优属工作，还做得不够。此外，在组织生产的时候，曾主观地规定了以百分之七十的优待粮去组织生产，结果影响了该发的优待粮发不下去。这缺点，已经很快就纠正了。
    救济失业也是一九五零年度的重要工作之一。因为在第二届第四次市各界人民代表会议上已做了比较详细的报告，所以这里不再赘述，只作如下的补充，即失业工人和知识分子已登记的人数，到去年年底，累计达到一万零一百八十三人（包括暂时失业的矿工二千人）。其中，先后就业的，已达四千五百六十九人。此外，去年一年中，城郊受过救济的贫民累计达二万二千余户，六万三千余人。移民到察绥去的七千五百十四人，介绍到东北做矿工的三百五十一人。乞丐被收容的累计达二千七百余人。
    总结上述各方面的工作，可以说，我们所提出的一九五零年度工作计划是完成了，并且，在许多方面还超过了。
    我们所以能够取得这样大的成绩，是毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党北京市委员会对我们正确领导的结果；也是广大人民和我们团结一致，共同奋斗的结果。一年来，北京市建设的经验，再度证明了人民民主制度的优越性。人民民主制度是真正符合于人民利益，具有高度行政效率的制度。
    但是另一方面，在我们的工作当中，也还存在着许多缺点。这些缺点的来源，除了一些客观原因外，主要是由于我们的干部城市工作经验不够，业务水平不高，或对政策了解得不够深刻，甚至还具有官僚主义和命令主义等作风。因此，怎样培养和教育干部，怎样整顿和改进干部的作风，就成为我们的重要任务之一。为此，我们在去年一年中，曾由行政干部学校轮训了五百二十名在职干部（另外，还训练了编余人员一百五十人，绝大部分已分别介绍工作），开办了公安学校及其他干部训练班。对于在职干部坚持了业余的学习制度。更重要的是我们曾进行有重点地检查工作和全面整风。前半年，先后检查了公共卫生局和卫生工程局的六个附属单位的工作，对于改善卫生工作人员的作风和加强卫生行政机关的领导起了一定的作用。此外，有的单位也进行了作风纪律的检查。在公安干部中曾进行过两次检查，反对无政府、无组织、无纪律和反对命令主义和贪污腐化。城区九个区经过区各界人民代表会议，进行了干部作风的检查，郊区在土地改革前后，曾两次整顿干部的思想作风，都收到了很大的效果。去年八月，我们制订了全面整风的计划，在干部中间展开了全面整风运动。这次整风是以从上而下地总结工作为主，根据人民政治协商会议共同纲领，中央人民政府所颁布的政策法令，市各界人民代表会议的决议和市人民政府的工作计划，全面地检查过去的工作，展开批评和自我批评。经过这一次整风运动，相当地提高了干部的政策水平和业务水平，改进了干部工作作风，调整了组织机构，建立了若干必要的工作制度并增进了干部之间的团结。整风的经验，再一度证明了在我们革命的队伍中，批评和自我批评是推动我们前进的最好武器。定期的和总结工作结合起来的整风，应当成为我们的一种工作制度。
    以上就是我对于一九五零年度工作的报告，请各位代表审查批评。
