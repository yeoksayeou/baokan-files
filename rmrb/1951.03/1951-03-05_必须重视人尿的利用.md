　　We Must Pay Attention to the Utilization of Human Urine
    Zhang Shaoqing
    In the utilization of human excrement and urine, there is a significant difference between rural areas in the North and the South. The North excessively values fecal matter, allowing urine to be wasted. This is both wasteful and extremely unscientific. According to surveys in Hebei Provincial Farm, Xuzhou Farm, and Qufu, Shandong, wheat yields increase by 60% when irrigated with urine compared to when it is not. The results of fertilization experiments in the wheat fields of Huimin Farm in Bohai, Shandong, demonstrate that wheat in the urine-irrigated areas has taller stalks, larger ears, deeper color, and higher yields. Irrigating with 1,600 jin of urine per mu results in a yield that is 50 to 60 jin higher than land fertilized with 60 jin of bean cake, and a yield that is 80 jin higher than land fertilized with 48 jin of cooked soybeans. After the wheat harvest, corn planted in the urine-irrigated area still grows robustly with high yields. When urine fertilizer is applied to uncultivated land in the winter, crops such as corn and sorghum can be planted the following year without additional fertilizer, and they will still grow well.

    Based on a nitrogen content of 0.5% in human urine, 15 jin of urine is equivalent to the nitrogen content of 1 jin of bean cake. Therefore, human urine is very effective, and crops grow well. Additionally, human urine contains not only soluble acids but also many nitrogenous organic compounds, such as urea and uric acid. According to expert research, the fertilizing effect of dried manure is only 70% to 80% of that of human urine, because urine contains 80% of the total nitrogen excreted by each person daily, while feces contain only 20%. Moreover, potassium carbonate is also excreted more through urine. Therefore, fresh urine should be diluted with water in the summer to prevent the concentration from being too high, which can prevent crop roots from absorbing nutrients, leading to withered branches and leaves. Alternatively, adding 4 liang of bean cake or bean flour to 100 jin of urine and letting it ferment will convert the urea into ammonia, making its application more reliable.

    In rice-growing areas in the South, urban and rural residents keep urine buckets in their homes and highly value urine fertilizer. However, in some areas of the North, there is neither equipment for collecting human urine nor a habit of utilizing it, resulting in the complete loss of valuable urine. If it could be collected, one person's urine for one year would be enough to fertilize one mu of land.

    According to the comprehensive report on fertilizer accumulation by the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture, the masses are gradually gaining a full understanding of the call to diligently pad livestock pens, accumulate more fertilizer, compare manure piles in the autumn, and compare grain piles during the New Year. However, the goal of fully and rationally utilizing human excrement and urine is still far away, and general technical knowledge of fertilizer accumulation is lacking. Some conservative habits still exist among farmers. Most farmhouses have toilets connected to pigsties, and livestock manure, dry firewood, leaves, and soil are added to create a mixed pen manure, known as "soil manure." Although some human urine flows into the pigsty, a portion is lost and evaporates due to the lack of urine storage equipment. We advocate storing and using human urine separately and should first solve the problem of urine storage equipment. Daqiao Township and Qilihe in Weishi, Henan, have used jars to store urine for irrigating wheat, a method that deserves widespread promotion.

    The proper way to promote the separate storage and use of human urine is to improve toilet facilities. Toilets should have roofs and walls to protect against wind, rain, and sunlight. Urine pits should be brick-lined and have lids to prevent the loss of fertilizer effectiveness. In areas where toilets are connected to pigsties, the channels connecting the toilets and pigsties should be enlarged or widened to allow all urine to flow into the pigsties. At the same time, urine pots and basins should be directly poured into the pens, and soil should be added frequently to absorb the urine and improve the quality of the pen manure. In areas where toilets are separate from pigsties, the following three things should be done in the toilets: First, dig urine pools or pits and mix the urine with soil for direct application in the fields. Second, place urine jars or vats and directly use the urine to irrigate the land. In areas with composting habits, the urine can be directly poured onto compost piles. Third, pile up some dry soil and sprinkle the urine on the soil piles. After the soil is soaked, replace it with dry soil piles to turn the urine into urine-rich soil, preserving the fertilizing power of the urine and achieving the goal of separate storage and use.

### 必须重视人尿的利用

　　必须重视人尿的利用
    张绍钫
    北方农村在人粪尿的利用上，有一点和南方大不相同，那就是过分重视了粪块，而让尿水任意流失。这是既浪费又极不科学的事情。据河北省立农场、徐州农场、山东曲阜等地的调查，每亩小麦，浇尿比不浇尿的，在产量上要增多百分之六十。山东渤海惠民农场麦田施肥试验的结果证明，浇尿区的麦子，麦秆高，麦穗大，颜色深，产量高。每亩浇尿一千六百斤，比施用六十斤豆饼的地，还要多收五六十斤小麦，比施用四十八斤熟豆子作肥的地，竟要多收八十斤小麦。浇尿区在小麦收获后，种上玉米，仍然生长粗壮，产量很高。冬天把尿肥浇在没种作物的地里，第二年不再施肥料，种了玉米和高粱，生长仍然很好。
    按照人尿含氮量百分之○·五计算，十五斤尿相当于一斤豆饼所含的氮量，所以人尿的劲头很大，庄稼生长很好。同时，人尿除含有可溶性酸类外，还有许多氮素有机物，如尿素，尿酸等。根据专家研究大粪干的肥效，仅达人尿肥效的七成到八成，因为每人每天排泄物中，尿里所含氮素占十分之八，而粪中所含仅占十分之二，同时炭酸加里也是由尿排出的较多；所以在夏天新鲜尿应先加水稀释，免因浓度过高、作物根部不能吸收，以致枝叶枯萎或在一百斤尿里加四两豆饼或豆粉，将尿沤熟，使尿素变成氨态，则应用时更有把握些。
    在南方水稻地区，城乡居民房内都放着尿桶，对尿肥非常重视。但在北方有些地区都是既无积蓄人尿的设备，更无利用尿的习惯，把有价值的尿完全损失，如能积蓄起来一人一年的尿就能上一亩田地。
    据河北省农业厅的积肥综合报告，群众对于勤垫圈，多积肥，秋天比粪堆，过年比粮堆的号召已逐渐有了充分的认识，不过距离充分合理利用人粪尿的目标尚远，一般积肥的技术常识不够。在农民中仍存在着某些保守习惯，多数农家的厕所与猪圈相连，再加牲畜粪、干柴、树叶、泥土，成为一种混合圈肥，就是所谓“土粪”。人尿虽然有一部分流到猪圈内，但因缺少存尿的设备，还有一部分流失与蒸发。我们提倡人尿单存单用，应当先解决积尿的设备。河南尉氏大桥乡和七里河，已用罐存尿浇麦，这是一个值得普遍推广的方法。
    提倡人尿单存单用的妥善办法，主要的必须改良厕所的设备，厕所要有顶，有墙，挡风避雨不怕日光，尿坑要用砖砌底，有盖，以便防止肥效的流失。厕所与猪圈相连的地区，要挖大或加宽厕所与猪圈相连的通道，使尿水全部流入猪圈，同时尿壶尿盆也直接倒入圈内，并加勤垫土，吸收尿液，提高圈肥质量。厕所与猪圈分开的地区，在厕所里要作到下面三件事情：第一、挖尿池或尿坑，以土拌尿，直接施入田间；第二、放尿罐或尿缸，直接用尿浇地，有堆肥习惯的地区，可以直接浇在堆肥上；第三、堆些干土，将尿撒在土堆上，等土湿透，再换干土堆，使尿液变成尿土，保存住尿的肥力，达到单存单用的目的。
