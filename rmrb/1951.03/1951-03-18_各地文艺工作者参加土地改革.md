Domestic Literary and Art Developments

    Literary and art workers from various regions have been participating in the land reform work since it began in East China, Central South China, and Southwest China. Among them are well-known writers and artists, such as Li Jianwu, Zheng Junli, Xu Jie, Zhou Xiaoyan, Danny, and Wei Jinzhi in East China; Li Ni, Wang Xiyan, and Tian Tao in Central South China; and Ai Wu, Sha Ting, and Wang Zimei in Southwest China. Novelist Jiang Muliang went deep into western Hunan and worked with the troops. He is now planning to write a full-length novel.
  Editing and Annotating Lu Xun's Works
    The work of editing and annotating Lu Xun's works has been underway for more than three months. Participants include Feng Xuefeng, Sun Yong, Wang Shijing, Yang Jiyun, and Lin Chen. Feng Xuefeng published an article entitled "Draft Plan for the Work Policy of Editing and Annotating Lu Xun's Works" in the third volume, ninth issue of "Wenyi Bao." He believes that the method and viewpoint of annotation work must be the scientific method and viewpoint of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. The purpose of annotation is not only to make it easier for readers to read Lu Xun's works, but also to clarify Lu Xun's thought, so that the progressive, revolutionary, and New Democratic essence of Lu Xun's thought is more clearly revealed to the world. Regarding the editing work, the draft plan suggests that Lu Xun's works in China will be published and distributed by the state in three forms: the most complete complete works, annotated single editions, and annotated selected works. The editing and annotation work for the three versions will be completed in two years.
  Masses Eagerly Demand Cultural Entertainment
    In rural areas after land reform, farmers urgently demand cultural entertainment. A woman in a certain rural area in Central South China eagerly made her request when she saw a cadre coming to the countryside: "You came from the city, please teach me a song!" Farmers especially welcome mobile film projection teams bringing movies to the villages. Farmers in Fuling, eastern Sichuan, rushed to carry machines and materials for the projection team. They would not let non-peasant association members carry them, and landlords were strictly forbidden. This was both to ensure the safety of the film and because the film being carried, "Red Flag Waves in the West," featured Chairman Mao, and should be given special respect. The Miao people in Central South China also very much enjoy watching movies. Sometimes, due to difficult mountain transportation, the Miao people voluntarily undertake transportation, with dozens of people taking turns day and night to cross the mountains to meet the needs of their compatriots in the deep mountains.

    各地文艺工作者参加土地改革
    自华东、中南、西南等区展开土地改革工作以来，当地文艺工作者已有不少参加这一工作。其中有著名的作家和艺术家，如华东区有李健吾、郑君里、许杰、周小燕、丹尼、魏金枝等；中南区有丽尼、王西彦、田涛等；西南区有艾芜、沙汀、汪子美等。小说家蒋牧良曾深入湘西，随部队工作，现计划写一长篇小说。
  编校注释鲁迅著作
    鲁迅著作的编校和注释工作，已经进行了三个多月。参加这一工作的有冯雪峰、孙用、王士菁、杨霁云、林辰等人。冯雪峰在三卷九期《文艺报》上发表了《鲁迅著作编校和注释的工作方针和计划草案》一文，他认为：关于注释工作，其方法和观点，必需是马克思、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的科学方法和观点，注释目的固然在于使读者能够更容易读鲁迅作品，但还必须能起一种对鲁迅思想的阐明作用，使鲁迅思想的进步的、革命的、新民主主义的本质更昭明于世。关于编校工作，计划草案建议：鲁迅著作将来在国内以最完整的全集本、注释单行本、注释选集本三种由国家出版发行。三种版本的编校注释工作均分别于二年中完成。
  群众迫切要求文化娱乐
    在经过土地改革后的农村中，农民迫切要求文化娱乐。中南区某农村中妇女看到下乡来的干部时，就热烈提出她的要求：“你从城里来，快教我一个歌吧！”巡回放映队将电影送到村里去映，农民尤其欢迎。川东涪陵农民争先给放映队抬机器材料。他们不让非农民协会的会员担，更不准地主抬。一面为了要保证影片的安全，一面因为所抬的影片《红旗漫卷西风》中有毛主席，应该特别尊重。中南区苗族人民也非常喜欢看电影，有时因山路交通困难，苗民自愿担任运输，数十人轮流日夜翻山赶运，以满足深山中同胞们的要求。
