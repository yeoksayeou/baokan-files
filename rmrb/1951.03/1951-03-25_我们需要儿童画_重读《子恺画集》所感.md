We Need Children's Paintings
    ——Reflections on Re-reading "ZiKai's Painting Collection"
    Wang Chaowen
    I have read many of Mr. Feng Zikai's cartoons. The first part of his "ZiKai's Painting Collection" (published by Kaiming Bookstore in 1927) was one of my favorite readings in my youth. Works such as "Zhanzhan's Dream," "Zhanzhan's Bicycle" (see illustration), "Creation and Appreciation," "A Bin Has Two Legs, the Stool Has Four Legs," etc., with children as the subject, were very attractive and moving to me. Even now, with many changes in my thoughts and feelings, rereading these works still gives me a sense of great familiarity. I believe these works are still worth selecting and reprinting.
    Rereading "ZiKai's Painting Collection," I keenly feel that there are too few children's paintings at present, and we are in great need of new children's painters!
    The advantage of Mr. Feng Zikai's cartoons is his broad sympathy for various kind-hearted people in society. The works in "ZiKai's Painting Collection" that depict children are equally filled with rich sympathy for children's fantasies. Children use banana leaf fans as bicycles, put shoes on stools, "scribble" on the walls, and have absurd dreams; these are not easily noticed by ordinary people and are easily forgotten by ordinary people. But Mr. Zikai, who loves and is familiar with children, keenly felt these things and cleverly expressed them. Although depicting ordinary small things in children's lives, they become meaningful artistic works that can arouse readers to read them repeatedly because of their authenticity and vividness.
    Mr. Zikai's cartoons depicting children embody his advocacy in the book "Cartoon Drawing Method": Pay attention to meaning and use brush and ink without restraint. Like some of his prose, they have the characteristics of being refined and approachable. They do not necessarily use exaggerated depictions, but the theme is very prominent. They are not flat records of phenomena, but extracts of artistic conceptions from the real feelings of life, expressed with unrestrained depictions. Of course, the content of Mr. Zikai's cartoons is not all good, and the form is not without its shortcomings. But since we do not advocate that every cartoonist (let alone every painter) should learn Mr. Zikai's painting style, then we have every right to defend the existence of Mr. Zikai's cartoons (except for a part of the content that needs to be improved), especially his children's paintings.
    We love the political caricatures of the Soviet Kukryniksy, love their sharp combat nature, strong political feelings, and their accurate and vivid images, so we unanimously introduce their works and creative experience and methods. We affirm the achievements of many new and old Chinese current affairs caricaturists, especially the achievements in the sacred propaganda task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending our homeland, because of their contributions in clearing up the feudal comprador-imperialist ideological front, in promoting patriotic and internationalist ideological education, and also because of their expressive techniques that conform to the appreciation habits and interests of the masses of the people. We love many well-painted New Year pictures, comic strips, and large murals, because they depict major historical events and also because they possess precise expressive techniques. However, we have not set and should not set rigid standards, thinking that only the Kukryniksy style and the current active current affairs cartoon style in China are the best and only styles in painting, thinking that narrative poems can replace sketches of life. No, the garden of new realism has no rigid boundaries, it allows and needs various styles, because the needs of real life and the appreciation of the masses are diverse. Lenin and Chairman Mao, these great people's leaders and cultural mentors, have also repeatedly instructed us: To develop a variety of artistic styles. No one has the right to limit the development of diverse styles. New realism art certainly has standards for measuring good and bad, but as long as it conforms to the interests of the people and conforms to the purpose of educating the people, it can be considered a valuable and good work. The Zikai style of cartoons has the conditions to become a part of new realism art, and should also be developed into a part.
    Our current problem is precisely that the road taken by painters is too narrow, a group of people are inappropriately crowded in one area, while many other positions are left unattended. Children's paintings are one of these many positions. As a reader, I have this idea: If Mr. Zikai or other artists use the Zikai cartoon style or other forms of painting style to depict the children of new China, a fresh flower will bloom in the art garden. As long as we broaden our horizons of life and love the children of new China, we can completely produce works as charming as the first part of "ZiKai's Painting Collection." Moreover, due to the change in the purpose and content of creation, works that are more popular with the majority of children and adults than these charming works of more than twenty years ago will be produced.
    The life, emotions, wishes, and fantasies of the children of new China have rich and healthy poetry. It is not only worth painting, but ignoring this aspect is a loss. We know that Gu Yuan's "Brother's Holiday" and Feng Zhen's "Children's Play," etc., woodcuts or New Year pictures with different styles, are also works depicting children and are popular. According to the actual situation, the painting topics in the lives of children in new China are much richer and healthier than in the old days. Therefore, it also has the favorable conditions for producing works that are more poetic, more charming, and more meaningful than "Zhanzhan's Bicycle," etc. Due to the change in the nature of society, the state of opposition between adults and children, which Mr. Zikai sighed and even sadly recognized in "ZiKai's Painting Collection," is changing, and the distance is narrowing. But children are still children after all. Children have different life experiences from adults, different intellectual development, and different appreciation needs. Unfortunately, many children's publications today rarely pay attention to this point. Cartoons that focus on depicting children wholeheartedly rather than perfunctorily, like the first part of "ZiKai's Painting Collection," are sorely needed today.
    As an art style, the Zikai style of cartoons is of course not limited to depicting children. As a praise of people's lives and a satire of backward phenomena, this small-scale cartoon has great potential. This impromptu reflection of life, whether it is praise or satire, the second part of "ZiKai's Painting Collection" and some of the author's later works also show the author's perception, grasp, and expressive talent. In the second part of "ZiKai's Painting Collection," impromptu reflections of life such as "New Year's Eve One" cannot be regarded as a tasteless record of phenomena. Satires such as "Education" and "After Graduation," are they not "gags" with profound meaning? Even the "Aspiration" (see illustration) which attempts another kind of brush and ink is also a very moving painting.
    It should be pointed out that many of Mr. Zikai's works are full of detached, sentimental, and old-fashioned humanitarian thoughts and feelings. We don't have to look for explanations from the poems and illustrations of "Hu Sheng's Painting Collection" which promotes non-killing, and we can also find proof in "ZiKai's Painting Collection." For example, works such as "Companion of Tears," "Mourner," and "Broken-String Kite" are clearly filled with sentimental emotions. Even individual cartoons by the author during the Anti-Japanese War have the shortcoming of simply exposing and arousing terror. These shortcomings are inseparable from Mr. Zikai's past thoughts and life. But Mr. Zikai has not relaxed his studies because of his old age! He is rapidly transforming and progressing. We hope that Mr. Zikai will be able to paint new works with new perspectives in the near future. This is the common hope of Chinese children who love to watch children's paintings and other cartoons, and adults who value the Chinese art tradition.

　　我们需要儿童画
    ——重读《子恺画集》所感
    王朝闻
    我曾经读过丰子恺先生许多漫画。其中的《子恺画集》（一九二七年开明书店出版）的第一部分，是我少年时期爱好的读物之一。《瞻瞻的梦》、《瞻瞻的脚踏车》（见插图）、《创作与鉴赏》、《阿宾两只脚，凳子四只脚》等等以儿童为题材的作品，曾经十分吸引我和感动我。即令是思想感情有了不少变化的现在，把这些作品重看了一遍，也仍有相当亲切的感觉。我以为，这些作品仍然值得加以选择重印。
    重读《子恺画集》，我痛感到目前的儿童画太少了，我们太需要新的儿童画家了！
    丰子恺先生的漫画的优点，是他对社会上各种善良人物的广泛的同情。《子恺画集》里描写儿童的作品，同样充满了对于儿童的幻想的丰富的同情。孩子用芭蕉扇当脚踏车使用，给凳子穿鞋，在墙上“乱”涂，做着无稽的幻梦；不容易被一般人注意，也很容易被一般人所忘却。但热爱儿童和熟悉儿童的子恺先生，敏锐地感觉到这些，把它们巧妙地表现了出来。虽然描写的是儿童生活中平凡的小事，由于真实和生动，所以成为意味深长的、能够引起读者反复阅读的一种艺术品。
    子恺先生这些描写儿童的漫画，体现着他在《漫画描法》一书中的主张：注重意义，无拘束地使用笔墨。也如同他的某些散文，具备着洗炼，平易近人的特色。不一定使用夸张的描法，但主题却十分凸出。不是平板的现象记录，而是从生活的实感中提炼出画意，用无拘束的描法加以表现。当然，子恺先生的漫画，内容并不都是好的，形式也不是没有缺陷的方面。但是我们既然并没有主张每个漫画家（更不要说每个画家）都学习子恺先生的画法，那么，我们就完全有权利为子恺先生的漫画（除了一部分内容需要改进以外）尤其是儿童画的存在来辩护了。
    我们爱好苏联库克雷尼克赛式的政治讽刺画，爱好他那尖锐的战斗的性质，强烈的政治感情，和他那准确而又生动的形象，所以一致介绍他的作品和创作经验、创作方法。我们肯定许多新的老的中国的时事讽刺画家的成绩，特别是抗美援朝保家卫国这一神圣的宣传任务中的成绩，由于他们在肃清封建的买办的帝国主义的思想战线上的功绩，在宣传爱国主义与国际主义的思想教育上的功绩，也由于他们那些符合人民大众欣赏习惯和欣赏兴趣的表现技法。我们爱好许多画得好的年画、连环画、大壁画，由于它们描写着重大的历史事件，也由于它们具备着精确的表现技巧。但是，我们没有定下也不应定下死板的标准，以为只有库克雷尼克赛式的，中国当前活跃着的时事漫画式作风是绘画上最好的和唯一的作风，以为叙事诗式的伟构可以代替生活描写的小品。不是的，新现实主义的园地并没有死板的界限，它容许而且需要各种各样的风格，因为现实的生活和群众的欣赏需要都是多种多样的。列宁和毛主席这些伟大的人民领袖和文化的导师也一再指示我们：要发展多种多样的艺术风格。谁也没有权利限制多种多样的风格的发展。新现实主义的美术当然有衡量好坏的标准，但只要符合人民的利益，符合教育人民的目的，都可以算是有价值的好的作品。子恺式的漫画有条件成为新现实主义美术中的一个部分，也应该发展成为一个部分。
    我们现在的问题，正是画家们所走的路太狭窄了，一群人不适当地拥挤在一个方面，而另外许多阵地却没有人去工作。儿童画就是这许多阵地中的一个。作为一个读者，我有这样一种想法：如果子恺先生或其他的美术家，运用子恺漫画式的或其他形式的画风来描写新中国的儿童，将在美术园地中开放一种新鲜的花朵。只要扩大生活的视野，热爱新中国的儿童，完全可以产生如同《子恺画集》第一部分那样富有魅力的作品。而且，由于创作目的与创作内容的改变，将产生比二十多年前这些富有魅力的作品，更能得到广大儿童以及成年人欢迎的作品。
    新中国的儿童的生活、情感、愿望、幻想，具有丰富的健康的诗意。不仅值得入画，而且忽略了这一方面就是一种损失。我们知道那些作风不尽相同的古元的“哥哥的假期”冯真的“娃娃戏”等等木刻或年画，同样是描写儿童而且受人欢迎的作品。根据实际的情况，新中国的儿童生活中的画题较之旧时代丰富得多健康得多。因此也就具备了产生比“瞻瞻的脚踏车”等等更有诗意、更有魅力和更有意义的作品的有利条件。由于社会性质的改变，子恺先生在《子恺画集》中慨叹地甚至伤感地认定的成人与儿童的对立状态正在改变，距离正在缩小。但儿童究竟是儿童。儿童与成人的生活经验不同，智力发展不同，欣赏需要不同。可惜今天许多儿童读物中的绘画却很少注意到这一点。像《子恺画集》第一部分那样专心致志地而不是敷衍了事地描写儿童的漫画，是今天所十分需要的。
    作为一种美术的风格，子恺式的漫画当然不限于描写儿童。作为一种人民生活的歌颂，以及落后现象的讽刺，这种小品式的漫画大有用武之地。这种即兴式的生活反映，不论是歌颂，不论是讽刺，《子恺画集》的第二部分和作者以后的一部分作品也显示了作者的感受与把握、表现的才能。在《子恺画集》第二部分中，如像“除夜一”这种即兴式的生活反映，不能当作现象的无味的记录。如像“教育”“毕业后”这样的讽刺，又何尝是没有深意的“噱头”？即令是尝试另一种笔墨的“憧憬”（见插图）也是一幅很动人的画。
    应当指出：子恺先生的不少作品充满了出世的、感伤的、旧人道主义的思想感情。我们不必从《子恺漫画》的诗词图句中，宣传不杀生的《护生画集》中寻找解释，就是在《子恺画集》中也可以得到证明。比如“泪的伴侣”、“凭吊者”、“断线鹞”等等作品，也就分明地洋溢着感伤的情调。即令是作者在抗日战争中的个别漫画，也有单纯暴露引起恐怖的缺点。这些缺点，是和子恺先生过去的思想和生活分不开的。但是子恺先生现在并没有因为老而放松了学习！他正在迅速地转变和进步中。我们希望不久以后子恺先生能够以新的观点画出新的作品。这是中国的儿童们爱看儿童画和其他漫画的成人们，重视中国美术传统的美术家们共同的希望。
