　　Can Grassroots Cooperatives Make Plans?
    Jiaohe County Cooperative in Jilin Province Leads Grassroots Cooperatives in Making Plans

    Is it possible for grassroots cooperatives to make plans? The experience of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, proves that it is entirely possible. The key lies in the county united cooperative being good at leadership and assistance.
    Jiaohe County cooperatives began to establish planning work in January of last year. Initially, the plans were entirely made by the county cooperative based on the tasks assigned by the provincial cooperative, plus some incomplete statistics and estimates, and were deployed from top to bottom to various district and village cooperatives. Generally, district and village cooperative cadres did not understand what planning was all about, and most of them did not even look at the plans issued by the county cooperative, but threw them in a drawer. At the same time, in the first and second quarters, both the county cooperative and the grassroots cooperatives took non-member masses and the market as their business objects, and strived to expand sales for money, with little contact with each other in business. The county cooperative's funds of 4.3 billion were all used for the three stores, except for fixed assets and investment in processing and production. Generally, cadres are accustomed to free buying and selling, and buy whatever goods are needed temporarily, thinking that planning is useless and that business can be done without a plan. Some village cooperative directors said: "We sell whatever the state-owned companies and higher-level cooperatives send us, without cheating the villagers, and we can do a good business. What's the use of planning?"
    After the third quarter, the county cooperative felt that it was difficult for the plan to be practical and impossible to play a role if only the county cooperative had a plan and the grassroots cooperatives did not make plans, and the distribution was entirely from top to bottom. At the same time, after the National Cooperative Conference, the policy of higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives serving members was conveyed at all levels, and the county cooperative closed all three stores within two months, specializing in wholesale to grassroots cooperatives. Therefore, it became even more necessary to promote grassroots cooperatives to make plans and integrate the plans of upper and lower-level cooperatives.
    Before the start of the third quarter plan, the county cooperative issued a simple supply and marketing plan form to each district and village cooperative, filling it out if they could, and estimating the quantity of several major commodities to be bought or sold if they could not. At the same time, it selected three village cooperatives with better work as typical examples and sent people to specifically help them prepare. Subsequently, a county-wide meeting of district and village cooperative directors was held. Some village cooperatives brought their filled-out plans, some only brought a few large numbers, and some could not even provide a number at all. At the meeting, the county cooperative director and the planning section used several typical cooperatives and other cooperatives that had made plans as examples to explain the benefits and methods of making plans to everyone, and mobilized the cadres of neighboring village cooperatives who had prepared plans to help those village cooperatives that could not provide numbers to discuss, estimate, and compare, and the county cooperative cadres helped them fill them out. This made these cooperatives realize that making plans is not difficult. As long as they know the number of members, the average demand of each member, the financial capacity of the cooperative, the business situation of the previous period, etc., they can make a plan. At the same time, the county cooperative held an examination at the meeting, which also played a great role in making cadres of each cooperative pay attention to statistics and plan numbers. Now, almost every village cooperative director can answer fluently the number of members, the number of shares, the total amount of funds, the turnover of the previous month, the planned number of this month, etc. of their own cooperative. Generally, cadres at least recognize the benefit of making a plan to "have a clear idea."
    After the fourth quarter, in order to strengthen the importance of plans by district and village cooperatives, to act in accordance with the plans, and to ensure the implementation of the county cooperative's wholesale plan, the county cooperative also implemented an order form system; the county cooperative uniformly printed and distributed order forms, on which the name, specification, quantity, and required period of the required commodities were indicated, and each district and village cooperative submitted them to the county cooperative's supply and marketing department according to their own purchase plans every month. The supply and marketing department compiled these order forms and contacted the county department store. If the company could supply them, the county cooperative would issue a letter of introduction to each district and village cooperative, and they could purchase them from the company with the letter. If the company could not supply them, the county cooperative would ask the provincial cooperative or send someone to purchase them from Shenyang and other places. Initially, the county cooperative was lenient with village cooperatives that did not submit order forms, and allowed them to buy some of the remaining goods. Later, it strictly followed the plan, and no leniency was granted to those who did not submit plans. In this way, the grassroots cooperatives were further driven to make plans on schedule in actual business. This year, more than 95% of the grassroots cooperatives' New Year's goods were solved through this method. The county cooperative has no cold goods in stock, and the original store used 24 people, but now the supply and marketing department only uses 4 people, but the turnover has increased.
    In the first quarter of this year, all 74 grassroots cooperatives in the county made plans on schedule. Some village cooperatives, such as Dailuhe, Nangangzi, and Bao'an cooperatives, have implemented the method of members submitting order forms since the third quarter. Most of their plans are close to reality, and the result of execution is limited from the original plan. The capital turnover of these cooperatives has been greatly accelerated.

　　基层合作社能否作计划
    吉林省蛟河县社领导基层社做计划的经验
      王圻
    基层合作社能否作计划？吉林省蛟河县的经验证明是充分可能的。关键在于县联合社善于领导和帮助。
    蛟河县合作社从去年一月起便开始建立计划工作。最初计划完全是由县社根据省社所分配的任务，加上自己的一些不完全统计、估计做出，自上而下向各区、村社布置。一般区、村社干部根本不了解计划是怎么一回事，对于县社发下来的计划大多连看也不看，便丢在抽屉里。同时在第一、二两个季度中，县社和基层社都是以非社员群众和市场为经营对象，各为扩大卖钱额而努力，彼此在业务上很少联系。县社资金四十三亿，除固定资产和加工生产投资外，全部用于三个门市部。一般干部习惯于自由买卖，临时要用什么货，就进什么货，认为计划无用处，没有计划一样可以作买卖。有的村社主任说：“国营公司、上级社来啥，我们卖啥，不骗老乡钱，就能做好买卖，要计划有啥用。”
    第三季度后，县社感觉单是县社有计划，基层社不作计划，完全自上而下的分配，计划不但难于切合实际，而且无法发生作用。同时，全国合作会议后，上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务的方针逐级传达下来，县社遂在两个月内将三个门市部，全部关闭，专作对基层社批发。因此更感到推动基层社作计划，使上下级社计划相互结合的必要。
    第三季度计划开始编制之前，县社一面将简单的供销计划表发给各区、村社，能填就填，不能填的可将要买或卖的几项主要商品数量作一估计，一面选择三个工作较好的村社作典型，派人具体帮助它们编制。随后召开全县区、村社主任会议，有些村社将计划填好带来，有的只带来几个大数，有的根本连数目也提不出。在会议上，县社主任和计划股就拿几个典型社和其他做出计划的合作社作例子，向大家讲解作计划的好处和作法，并动员编过计划的邻近村社干部，帮助那些提不出数来的村社研究讨论，估计比较，由县社干部帮助他们填写。使这些合作社了解到做计划并不是难事，只要确实知道社员人数，每个社员平均需要量，合作社资金能力，上期营业情况等等，便可以把计划做出来。同时县社又在会议上举行一次考试，对于各社干部重视统计、计划数字，也发生了很大作用。现在差不多每个村社主任对于本社社员数、股金数、资金总额、上月营业额、本月计划数等等都能对答如流。一般干部至少认识了作计划可以使“心中有数”的好处。
    第四季度后，县社为加强区、村社对计划的重视，按计划办事，并保证县社批发计划的实现，又实行了订货单制度；由县社统一印发订货单，上面注明需要商品品名、规格、数量、需要时期，由各区、村社根据自己进货计划按月填送县社供销部。供销部将这些订货单汇总起来，向县百货公司接洽，凡公司能供应的，由县社开介绍信交各区、村社，凭信到公司购买。公司不能供给的，县社要求省社或自己派人到沈阳等地采办。不提订货单的村社，最初县社尚予通融，可买部分剩余货物。后来就严格按照计划办事，不提计划的概不通融。这样就在实际业务上更进一步地带动了基层社按期作计划。今年春节各基层社办年货，百分之九十五以上都是通过这一办法解决的。县社毫无冷货积压，原来门市部用二十四人，现在供销部只用四人，营业额反而增加。
    今年第一季度全县七十四个基层社都按期作出计划。有些村社如代露河、南岗子、保安等合作社从第三季度起便实行社员提订销货单办法，他们所做计划大都接近实际，执行结果与原计划相差有限。这些合作社资金周转都大大加速。
