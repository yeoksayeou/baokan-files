　　Preventing Formalism in the Ma Hengchang Group Competition Movement

    The Ma Hengchang group competition movement has now been launched with great enthusiasm. The pressing issue at present is that leadership must be strengthened to prevent formalism. After the seven groups of Class B in the fine yarn section of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in Tianjin responded to the challenge, the trade union relaxed its leadership, causing the groups' response to the challenge to become a mere formality, and the challenge conditions were not fully met. In addition, some factories and trade unions have not recognized the ongoing nature of the competition, thinking it is only a temporary campaign. For example, the Shang Huanting group of the undercarriage workshop of the Tangshan Railway Factory stopped after completing their January task, believing that "the task is completed, and the challenge is over." Furthermore, some workers believe that "the Ma Hengchang group are machine workers, the work is different, and the industries are different, so how can we compare?" Because these ideas have not been completely resolved for the workers, launching the competition can easily become a mere formality. All regions must earnestly publicize the experience of the Ma Hengchang group and promote it in combination with the experience of their own production units. Recently, the Lüda area put forward the slogan "Different trades, same principles," and used practical examples to conduct education, resolving the idea that "the work is different, and the industries are different," which is very good and can be followed by all regions. Trade union cadres should promptly go deep among the workers during the movement to check, discover, and help solve problems, so as to further advance the competition movement.

### 防止马恒昌小组竞赛运动的形式主义

　　防止马恒昌小组竞赛运动的形式主义
    马恒昌小组竞赛运动现已热烈展开，目前迫切的问题是必须加强领导，防止形式主义。国营天津第一棉纺织厂一纱场细纱间乙班七个组应战后，由于工会放松领导，使小组应战流于形式，应战条件未能全部完成。另有些工厂和工会没有认识到竞赛的经常性，只以为是一个临时性的突击，像唐山铁路工厂车架场商焕庭小组在一月份任务完成后便停下来了。认为“任务完成了，应战算是过去了”。此外，有些地方的工友认为“马恒昌小组是机器工，工作不同、行业两样，那能比得上。”因为这些思想没有完全帮助工人解决，发动竞赛就容易流于形式。各地必须认真宣传马恒昌小组的经验，并和自己生产单位的经验结合起来进行推广。最近旅大地区曾提出了“隔行不隔经”的口号，用实际事例进行了教育，解决了“工作不同，行业两样”的思想，这是很好的，各地可以效法。工会工作干部应在运动中及时深入到工人中去检查、发现和帮助解决问题，以便将竞赛运动向前推进一步。
