A Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    On January 31st, the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily published a letter from Wang Zheliang of Beijing, reflecting that during the repair of the sewer in front of the Jinghua Rubber Factory at No. 81 Jiugulou Dajie in our city, the absence of red warning lights at night caused worker Wang Shiqing of the factory to fall into the pit and be injured. In addition to apologizing to Wang Shiqing, we accept Wang Zheliang's suggestion that red lights or other safety equipment should be universally installed at the construction site at night to prevent danger.

    This year's ditch dredging project is being carried out simultaneously throughout the city's drainage system. The locations are widespread, and after digging, triangular red light signs are placed at each intersection and in areas with heavier traffic. However, sometimes red lights are insufficient or the construction site temporarily neglects to install them. According to investigation, red lights were indeed not installed when digging the old Gulou Dajie section, which was the negligence of the person in charge of the construction site. We have notified the Engineering Corps to criticize the person in charge of the construction site.

### 京市卫生工程局对鼓楼大街工地夜间未设红灯的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    京市卫生工程局对鼓楼大街工地夜间未设红灯的检讨编辑同志：
    一月三十一日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载了京市王哲良来信，反映本市在整修旧鼓楼大街八十一号京华橡胶厂门前下水道时，因夜间未设红灯标志，致该厂工人王世清掉入坑内，并受了伤。我们除向王世清致歉外，并接受王哲良的建议，夜间应于工程处普设红灯或其他防止危险的设备。
    今年的掏沟工程、系按全市沟道系统同时举办，地点极为普遍，在打眼以后每个交叉路口及交通较繁的地方，都有三角红灯的标志；但有时因红灯不敷分配，或因工地一时忽略致未装设红灯。据调查在掏挖旧鼓楼大街沟段时，确未装设红灯，这是工地负责人的疏忽。我们已通知工程总队，对该工地负责人予以批评。
  北京市人民政府卫生工程局
