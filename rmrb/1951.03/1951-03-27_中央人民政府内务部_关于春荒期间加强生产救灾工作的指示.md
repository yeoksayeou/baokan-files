The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government
    Directive on Strengthening Production and Disaster Relief During the Spring Famine

    1. Thanks to the material support from the People's Government, mutual assistance and relief among the people, and efforts in production and disaster relief, there is already a good chance of surviving the spring famine in various disaster areas. However, during the spring famine, old disasters can easily develop, and new disasters can also easily occur. People's governments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas must still pay close attention to this work without any relaxation.

    2. The movement of production for self-relief and relief should be carried out more deeply and universally. Not only should we strengthen the work in severely affected areas, continuously affected areas, and flood areas, but also pay attention to lightly affected areas and areas with poor harvests in the mountains. Not only should we organize men and women disaster victims with labor power to participate in production, but also pay more attention to the elderly, weak, and extremely poor who have no labor power—either lead them to produce or provide them with longer-term relief. It should be known that hunger, illness, and even death can easily occur among these people.

    3. Strive to solve the difficulties of spring plowing for disaster victims and achieve timely sowing. Plant more spring vegetables and more early-maturing crops. In areas where floods are still not easy to avoid for the time being, it is necessary to plan and guide farmers to change the production system, that is, to change to planting early-maturing crops or crops suitable for water areas, and establish a sideline foundation to meet needs.

    4. In the Huai River Basin, the Yongding River, the Daqing River and other areas that have been hit by floods in succession, it is necessary to strengthen the ditch and canal projects to ensure that there can be a full or large summer harvest this year.

    5. Existing relief grain, loan grain, etc., should be issued in a timely manner to promote production.

    6. Advocate thrift and organize social forces to carry out social mutual aid movements.

    7. In areas with minor disasters, focus on production for self-relief and social donations, and free lending to seek solutions.

    8. More care should be given to the poor among the families of martyrs, soldiers, and staff.

    9. For disaster victims who have fled, a method of one party receiving and one party sending should be agreed upon so that they can return to their hometowns in time without delaying spring plowing.

    10. Prevention of epidemics and animal diseases in disaster areas should be prepared in advance, and once discovered, they should be immediately eliminated.

　　中央人民政府内务部
    关于春荒期间加强生产救灾工作的指示
    一、由于人民政府给的物质支持和人民的互助救济，以及生产救灾工作的努力，各灾区度荒的把握，已经有了。但在春荒期间，旧灾容易发展，新灾也容易发生；有灾地区的各级人民政府仍须一点不放松地重视这一工作。
    二、要把生产自救与救济的运动更深入与普遍地展开。不仅要加强重灾区、连灾区与水区工作，而且要注意轻灾区和歉收的山区。不仅要组织有劳动力的男女灾民参加生产，且更要注视那些无劳动力的老弱和极穷苦者，——或带动其生产，或予以较长的救济。要知道挨饿、害病以至于死，很容易发生于这些人的中间。
    三、努力解决灾民的春耕困难，获得适时下种。多种春菜，多种早熟作物。在一时还不易避免水灾的地区，要有计划地领导农民改变生产制度，即改种早熟作物或宜于水区的作物，建立副业基础，以适应需要。
    四、淮河流域，永定河、大清河等流域连遭水灾地区要加强沟洫工程，保证今年能有全部或大部夏收。
    五、现有的救济粮、贷粮等，要及时发下，推动生产。
    六、提倡节约，组织社会力量，开展社会互济运动。
    七、偏灾地区着重以生产自救及社会捐助，自由借贷，求得解决。
    八、对烈士、军人、工作人员家属的贫苦者，要予以更多的照顾。
    九、外逃灾民，要商定一方接、一方送的方法，使及时还乡，不误春耕。
    十、灾区疫病及兽疫要预作防范，一经发现，立即扑灭。
                                 一九五一年三月十六日
