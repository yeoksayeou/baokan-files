    Promote the Trade Union Law

    After a factory in Anshan publicized and studied the Trade Union Law, coupled with the improvement of the work style of the trade union cadres, the staff and workers recognized that the trade union is the organization of their own working class. They then voluntarily requested to join the union. In less than fifty days, the trade union membership increased by eighty-two. Members who did not pay union dues in the past are now enthusiastically paying them, with some even making up for the five months of dues they owed. The mutual aid and welfare work of the trade union has been done better, and the mutual aid fund has a surplus. The trade union cadres feel that the work is easier than before, and they are more responsible to the workers, believing that they are no longer just "rubber stamp committee members." This shows that a broad and detailed explanation of the Trade Union Law to the staff and workers is an essential step to raise the consciousness of the working class and run the trade union well.

    Although the Trade Union Law of the Central People's Government has been promulgated for more than half a year, many places have not seriously publicized it. A large number of staff and workers in some enterprises and institutions do not even know that the country has such a major law related to the vital interests of the working class. Because of this, many staff and workers do not know what the trade union does, what the benefits of participating are, and why they must pay union dues, regarding the payment of union dues as a "burden." A small number of workers with poor political awareness even believe that the current trade union is no different from the Kuomintang's yellow trade union, only urging the payment of dues even more tightly. In this way, the broad masses of staff and workers will naturally not actively participate in the activities of the trade union, and the trade union is actually only an organization of a few trade union cadres. Even in places where the work is done better, only a few activists among the workers are united. This is one of the fundamental reasons why trade unions in many places and enterprises today are divorced from the workers. Therefore, a wide and systematic publicity of the Trade Union Law, so that staff and workers have a correct understanding of the trade union, and thus truly actively participate in various activities of the trade union, is an important prerequisite for doing a good job in trade union work.

    However, publicizing the Trade Union Law cannot be done only with words, but also with practical actions. The masses' belief in facts is of course higher than their belief in words. The reason why a factory in Anshan was successful is that, while publicizing the Trade Union Law, the trade union cadres earnestly improved their work style, followed the mass line, mobilized the workers to run the trade union together, and put the focus of the trade union work on the workshops, making decisions on matters relating to the interests of the workers, such as the payment of mutual aid funds, based on everyone's opinions, so that the Trade Union Law was gradually implemented in the process of publicity. If, on the one hand, the Trade Union Law is talked about a lot, while at the same time the trade union cadres are still aloof, monopolizing everything in the trade union, and not allowing the staff and workers to intervene, then the workers will still think that the trade union and the Trade Union Law have nothing to do with them. Therefore, when launching the publicity of the Trade Union Law, all localities must first effectively educate the trade union cadres, conscientiously implement the Trade Union Law, and improve their work style.

### 宣传工会法

　　宣传工会法
    鞍山某厂经过对于工会法的宣传和学习，加上工会干部实际工作作风的改善，使职员和工人群众认识到工会是工人阶级自己的组织，他们便纷纷自动要求入会，在不到五十天的时间中，工会会员增加了八十二名；过去不缴会费的会员，现在也踊跃缴纳会费，有的人一次把以往所欠五个月的会费补缴；工会的互助福利事业办得更好了一些，互助金有了盈余；工会干部感到工作比以前好做，并且更加对工人群众负责，认为自己现在已不是“盖戳委员”。这说明：向职工群众广泛而详尽地讲解工会法，是提高工人阶级觉悟和办好工会的必不可少的步骤。
    虽然中央人民政府的工会法已经颁布了半年多，但许多地方并没有认真地进行宣传，有些企业机关中的广大职工群众甚至不知道国家有这样一部关系工人阶级切身利益的大法存在。正因为这样，很多职员和工人群众不知道工会是干什么的，参加了有什么好处，为什么必须缴纳会费，把缴纳工会会费看作是一种“负担”；少数政治认识差的工人甚至认为现在的工会和国民党的黄色工会没有什么不同，只是催缴会费催得更紧一些。这样，广大的职工群众自然不会积极地参加工会的活动，工会实际上只是少数工会干部的组织；工作作得好一些的地方，也不过团结了很少几个工人中的活动分子。这是今天许多地方和企业中的工会脱离工人群众的根本原因之一。所以，广泛地而又有系统地宣传工会法，使职工群众对工会有正确的认识，从而真正积极参加工会的各种活动，是做好工会工作的重要前提。
    但是，宣传工会法不能光用嘴巴宣传，还得用实际行动宣传。群众对于事实的信仰当然要比对说话的信仰更高一些。鞍山某厂的所以获得成功，就在于与宣传工会法同时，工会干部根据工会法的精神，认真地改进工作作风，走群众路线，发动工人大家来办工会，把工会工作重心放到车间中去，把关系工人群众利益的事情，例如互助金的支付，根据大家意见评定，使工会法在宣传过程中就逐步地实现。如果一方面大讲工会法，而同时工会干部依然高高在上，包办工会的一切，不让职工群众过问，那么工人群众还会认为工会和工会法都跟他们没有关系。所以，各地在发动宣传工会法的时候，首先必须切实教育工会干部，认真执行工会法，改进工作作风。
