　　The China Democratic National Construction Association, China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiu San Society, and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other groups
    Firmly support the resolutions and declarations of the World Peace Council
    Strive to conclude a peace pact and implement various resolutions
    [Reported by this newspaper] The China Democratic National Construction Association, China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiu San Society, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and students in the capital enthusiastically support the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace pact and the nine resolutions passed. A spokesman for the China Democratic National Construction Association stated: The World Peace Council's declaration, which calls for a meeting of the five major powers—China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—to conclude a peace pact, is a very concrete and effective step towards safeguarding world peace. All peace-loving people around the world will strive to achieve this demand. Of course, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, manipulated by warmongers, are unwilling to have such a pact. If they dare to openly refuse, they will expose their warmongering nature in front of the masses. The spokesman stated: The nine resolutions of the World Peace Council are also very important, such as advocating peaceful solutions to the German and Japanese issues, which are in line with the public opinion of the world. Finally, he stated: We enthusiastically support the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions and are willing to fight for their realization. The China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement stating: We read with great excitement the declaration on concluding a peace pact passed by the World Peace Council at its meeting in Berlin. This declaration calls for the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France to conclude a peace pact in order to realize the hopes of hundreds of millions of people around the world—regardless of their views on the causes of the world war danger—and to consolidate peace and ensure international security. What a bright, sincere, and appropriate call to the demands of hundreds of millions of people! We are willing to use our greatest strength to achieve the purpose of this declaration and are willing to make our greatest efforts to invite all good people and peace-loving groups to sign in support of this movement. The Jiu San Society issued a statement saying: We fully agree with the World Peace Council's declaration that "any government of any of the five major powers that refuses to hold a meeting to conclude such a pact proves that the government has aggressive intentions." We fully agree with and firmly support the World Peace Council's resolutions on the peaceful settlement of the issues of Japan, Germany, and Korea. A spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions pointed out: The World Peace Council's declaration and nine resolutions fully meet our wishes. All workers in Beijing resolutely support them and are willing to fight for their complete realization. At present, all workers in the city should strengthen current affairs learning, further develop the patriotic movement, and more broadly and deeply carry out the Ma Hengchang team production competition. All faculty and staff of Renmin University of China stated that they are willing to do their utmost, hold high the banner of peace, immediately launch a signature campaign, and fight to the end to implement the various resolutions of the World Peace Council. Faculty, students, and staff of Beijing Normal University unanimously supported the World Peace Council's declaration. Professors such as Zhong Jingwen, Huang Yaomian, Li Changzhi, and Peng Hui also made speeches on this. Northern Jiaotong University and Beijing Railway College broadcast this solemn declaration at noon on February 28. All teachers and students immediately expressed their firm support and asked to sign the declaration. Classes 2 of the Electrical Engineering Department and Class 2 of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering of North China University held heated discussions on the declaration and resolutions.
