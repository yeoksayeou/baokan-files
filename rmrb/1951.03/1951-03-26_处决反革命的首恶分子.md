　　Executing the Ring Leaders of Counterrevolutionaries
　　A large number of counterrevolutionary criminals were executed in Beijing on the 25th. In handling this batch of counterrevolutionary cases, the Beijing Municipal People's Government fully demonstrated an extremely cautious attitude and a serious and responsible spirit. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Military Control Commission's Military Law Office, closely relying on the masses, not only conducted detailed investigations and research into the crimes of the counterrevolutionaries, but also, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries" and the "Resolution on the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, sorted out all kinds of counterrevolutionary cases one by one. Before the verdicts of these cases were announced, the Municipal Public Security Bureau not only submitted important cases, together with the evidence of each case, to the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Consultative Committee for reporting and exhibition; but also went through discussions at the enlarged joint meeting of more than 5,000 municipal and district people's representatives, and held on-the-spot accusations against the crimes of the counterrevolutionaries. Now the People's Government fully accepts the unanimous and firm demands of the people's representatives from all walks of life and imposes the death penalty on this group of counterrevolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes. This is not only to avenge the boundless hatred of countless victims; but also necessary to defend the fruits of the people's revolutionary victory, protect the safety of the people's lives and property, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and safeguard the people's economic construction.
　　The criminals executed in Beijing this time are of five types: the first type is the ring leaders who have consistently engaged in counterrevolutionary activities; the second type is those who, after liberation, still did not repent and continued to engage in counterrevolutionary activities; the third type is the special agent Taoist leaders who used feudal Taoist sects to carry out counterrevolutionary activities; the fourth type is the despots who have committed numerous crimes; and the fifth type is habitual bandits. These counterrevolutionaries are all guilty of unforgivable crimes. For example, the special agent Li Suhou, who shot and killed more than 1,000 people with a machine gun; the special agent Li Shilin, who arrested more than 200 revolutionary workers and progressive people and personally strangled 15 people; the special agent Leng Shaoying, who beat Professor Chen Jinkun and other patriotic people and severely tortured more than 60 patriotic students; the special agent Wang Fengchao, who burned down more than 1,000 houses before liberation and then colluded to rob 11 times after liberation; Jin Hankui, the leader of the Jiugong Taoist altar who fabricated more than 90 kinds of rumors; the special agent Taoist leader Li Taisheng, who gathered more than 5,000 people to plot a riot; Wang Tingshu, the "King of Hell" who seized land and forced people to their deaths; Yan Wenhui, the despot who kidnapped more than 80 laborers and raped many women; Zhao Xiushan, the habitual bandit who robbed 17 times and injured the victims, etc. The crimes of these many counterrevolutionaries are inexhaustible. If these counterrevolutionary criminals, whom "everyone deserves to kill," are not sentenced to death, then it is no wonder that the masses of people will criticize the People's Government for being "lawless." If some people think that these counterrevolutionaries can also not be killed, it is tantamount to making the masses of people forever suffer the harm and oppression of the counterrevolutionaries and never be able to stand up. Can this be tolerated by the people?
　　Obviously, the masses of people are firmly in favor of killing these ring leaders of counterrevolutionaries. Because only by killing these criminals can we completely eliminate all counterrevolutionary sabotage activities, consolidate the victory won by the struggle and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs, and prevent the broad masses of people from continuing to suffer the harm of counterrevolutionaries. Master Juzan, the representative of the Beijing Buddhist community, said at the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Consultative Committee: "Killing counterrevolutionaries does not contradict the Buddhist precept of killing. Because killing a very small number of reactionaries saves the vast majority of the people and warns criminals to commit fewer crimes, this is meritorious." The opinion of this Buddhist is completely consistent with the opinion of the broad masses of people. The people's firm demand to kill the ring leaders of counterrevolutionaries is also completely in line with the historical experience of our people's revolution. The policy of "combining suppression with leniency" that we are implementing today is an important experience of our people's revolution. Because only by correctly implementing the resolute and severe suppression of the ring leaders of counterrevolutionaries can those reactionary elements whose crimes are not serious and who have the possibility of reform honestly repent, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and receive lenient treatment. As for international revolutionary experience, there is even more. I remember that during the civil war after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, Lenin emphasized more than once the necessity of severely suppressing counterrevolutionaries. For example, in Lenin's "Telegram to the Provincial and County Soviets" on June 2, 1918, he pointed out that it is necessary to "ensure our rear. For this purpose, it is necessary to shoot all spies, traitors, White Guard elements, and counterrevolutionary traitors who directly or indirectly help the enemy." Lenin and Stalin, on the issue of suppressing counterrevolutionaries, like on all other issues, made many important instructions. Although the situation in the Soviet Union at that time was very different from the situation in our country today, the spirit and need for such resolute suppression of counterrevolutionaries are completely consistent.
　　We should not forget for a minute that the remaining forces of counterrevolution are currently carrying out various kinds of conspiracies and sabotage activities in many corners of society, and some are trying every means to infiltrate our people's country's factories, schools, and institutions. Among this group of executed counterrevolutionaries, there were special agent Dong Huachang, who infiltrated the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau to carry out sabotage, and special agent Wu Hongyou, who infiltrated our military organs to carry out sabotage. Facts have proved that these counterrevolutionaries are adopting a method of mutual cooperation from both the outside and the inside to undermine our people's democratic cause. Therefore, to defend the people's democratic system, we must exercise iron-fisted dictatorship over these counterrevolutionaries, and there is no doubt about it. Lenin said well in his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" published on April 28, 1918: "Dictatorship is a big word. And big words should not be said casually. Dictatorship is an iron-fisted government, a government with revolutionary courage and agile action." "And our government is extremely soft, often not like iron, but very much like paste." We should also follow Lenin's spirit to examine our own work. Among our comrades, are there not also some people who often say "people's democratic dictatorship" too easily, close to saying it casually? Hasn't anyone ever expressed unprincipled leniency towards counterrevolutionaries? Isn't this "extremely soft, often not like iron, but very much like paste"? Now every member of the people should be made to see clearly the crimes of the counterrevolutionaries! Every member of the people should understand that only by exercising iron-fisted dictatorship over the counterrevolutionaries can we guarantee that the people have full democratic rights within themselves.
　　Before executing this large group of counterrevolutionaries, Beijing, in addition to conducting principled discussions at the municipal people's representative conference and discussing the handling policy of these counterrevolutionary cases at the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Consultative Committee, also convened a mass meeting of thousands of people and held accusations, which is of great educational significance to the urban people. Mass meetings of this nature should also be held in other cities. Lenin praised such mass meetings in his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" published on April 28, 1918. He said: "Mass meetings, this is the true democracy of the working masses, this is when they raise their eyebrows and exhale, this is when they wake up to a new life." Countless practical experiences have fully proved that this is the truth. We should further extend this experience to the struggle to suppress counterrevolutionaries. Because suppressing counterrevolutionaries is a serious struggle, and like other struggles, it should fully rely on the masses, mobilize the broad masses of the people to work together with the People's Government.

### 处决反革命的首恶分子

　　处决反革命的首恶分子
    一大批反革命罪犯二十五日在北京伏法了。北京市人民政府在处理这一批反革命案件的过程中，充分表现了极端慎重的态度和严肃负责的精神。市公安局和军事管制委员会军法处，紧密地依靠群众，对于反革命分子的罪行，不但进行了详尽的调查研究，而且根据《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》和北京市第三届各界人民代表会议《关于镇压反革命的决议》，将各种反革命案件一一加以清理。在这些案件宣判之前，市公安局不但将重要的案件，连同各案的罪证，向市协商委员会扩大会议提出报告并进行展览；而且还经过了市、区各界人民代表五千余人的扩大联席会议的讨论，并当场举行了对于反革命分子罪行的控诉。现在人民政府完全接受了各界人民代表一致坚决的要求，对于这一批罪大恶极的反革命分子处以极刑。这不但是为无数被害的人民伸雪了无边的仇恨；而且这是为了保卫人民革命胜利的果实、保护人民生命财产的安全、巩固人民民主专政和保卫人民的经济建设事业所必需的。
    北京市这一次处决的罪犯有五种类型：第一种是一贯进行反革命活动的首恶分子，第二种是解放以后仍然毫不悔祸，继续进行反革命活动的分子，第三种是利用封建道门进行反革命活动的特务道首，第四种是罪恶多端的恶霸，第五种是惯匪。这些反革命分子，都是罪无可赦的。例如，用机枪射杀了一千多群众的特务李肃侯，逮捕了二百多个革命工作人员和进步群众并亲手勒死十五人的特务李士林，殴打陈瑾昆教授和其他爱国人士并严刑拷打爱国学生六十余人的特务冷少颖，解放前烧毁民房千余间而解放后又结伙抢劫十一次的特务王凤巢，制造九十多种谣言的九宫道坛主金汉魁，纠合五千余人阴谋暴动的特务道首李泰成，霸占土地逼死人命的“阎王爷”王廷枢，抓走民夫八十余人并强奸很多妇女的恶霸阎文辉，行抢十七次伤害事主的惯匪赵秀山等等，这许多反革命分子的罪恶是诉说不完的。如果对于这些“国人皆曰可杀”的反革命罪犯不处以极刑，那就无怪乎人民群众要批评人民政府是“有天无法”了。如果有人以为对于这些反革命分子也可以不杀，那就等于要使人民群众永远受反革命分子的残害与压迫，永远不能翻身了。这难道是人民所能够容忍的吗？
    显然，人民群众是坚决主张杀掉这些反革命的首恶分子的。因为只有杀掉这些凶犯，才能彻底消除一切反革命的破坏活动，才能巩固无数革命先烈奋斗牺牲所换来的胜利，才能使广大人民群众不至于继续遭受反革命分子的残害。北京佛教代表巨赞法师在市协商委员会的扩大会议上说：“杀反革命分子和佛的杀戒也不矛盾。因为杀掉了极少数的反动分子，救活了最大多数的人民，并且警戒了犯罪的人少犯罪，这是功德。”这位佛教徒对于这个问题的意见，是和广大人民的意见完全一致的。人民群众坚决要杀掉反革命首恶分子的主张，和我国人民革命的历史经验也是完全符合的。我们今天实行的“镇压与宽大相结合”的方针，正是我国人民革命的一项重要经验。因为只有正确地实行了对于反革命首恶分子的坚决严厉的镇压，才能使那些罪恶不重而又有可能改造的反动分子老老实实悔过自新、立功赎罪，获得从轻处理的宽大待遇。至于国际的革命经验就更多了。记得在苏联十月革命后的国内战争时期，列宁曾不只一次地强调对反革命分子实行严厉镇压的必要。比如在一九一八年六月二日列宁“致各省县苏维埃电”，就曾指出要“保障自己的后方。为了这个目的，必须把直接间接帮助敌人的一切侦探、奸细、白匪分子、反革命叛徒，概行枪毙。”列宁和斯大林在镇压反革命的这个问题上，和在其他一切问题上一样，曾经做了许多重要的指示。虽然当时苏联的情况和今日我国的情况有许多不同，但是这种坚决镇压反革命的精神和需要却是完全一致的。
    我们每一分钟都不应该忘记，反革命的残余势力，目前不但在社会上的许多角落里进行着各种各样的阴谋破坏活动，而且有的千方百计地打入了我们人民国家的工厂、学校、机关里来。在这一批处决的反革命分子中，就有混入京津铁路局进行破坏的特务董化昌，混入我军事机关进行破坏的特务吴鸿猷等。事实证明，这些反革命分子正在采取着从外部和内部两方面互相配合的方法，来破坏我们的人民民主事业。因此，我们要保卫人民民主制度，就必须对于这些反革命分子实行铁一般的专政，这是毫无疑义的。列宁在一九一八年四月二十八日发表的《苏维埃政权的当前任务》一文中说得好：“专政是一个很大字眼。而大字眼是不可以随便乱说的。专政就是铁一般的政权，是有革命勇气和行动敏捷的政权。”“而我们的政权却柔软极了，往往不大像铁，却很像浆糊。”我们也应该按照列宁的这种精神来检讨我们自己的工作。在我们的同志中，不是也有些人常常把“人民民主专政”说得太容易，近于随便乱说吗？不是曾经有人对于反革命分子也表示无原则的宽大吗？这难道不是“柔软极了，往往不大像铁，却很像浆糊”吗？现在应该让每一个人民群众都看清楚反革命分子的罪恶了！应该让每一个人民群众都懂得，只有对于反革命分子实行铁一般的专政，才能保证在人民内部有充分的民主权利。
    在处决这一大批反革命分子之前，北京市除了在市的各界人民代表会上做了原则讨论，在市协商委员会扩大会议上对这些反革命案件的处理方针做了讨论以外，又召开了数千人的大会，并举行控诉，这对于城市人民是具有重大教育意义的。这样性质的群众性的大会，在其他城市也应该召开。列宁在一九一八年四月二十八日发表的《苏维埃政权的当前任务》一文中曾夸奖这样的群众大会。他说：“群众大会，这也就是劳动群众的真正民主制，这是他们扬眉吐气之际，这是他们向新生活觉醒起来。”无数的实际经验完全证明了这是真理。我们应该更加推广这个经验到镇压反革命的斗争中去。因为镇压反革命是一个严重的斗争，它和其他各种斗争一样，完全应该紧密地依靠群众，动员广大人民群众和人民政府一道来共同进行。
