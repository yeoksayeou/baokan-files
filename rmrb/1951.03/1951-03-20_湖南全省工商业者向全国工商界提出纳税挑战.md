　　Hunan Province Industrialists and Businessmen Launch Tax Payment Challenge to National Industrial and Business Circles
　　From March 3rd to 7th, representatives from industrial and commercial circles in ten special districts and the two cities of Changsha and Hengyang in Hunan Province held a provincial meeting of industrial and commercial representatives on taxation. In order to further promote the anti-tax evasion and anti-arrears movement in 1951, the industrial and commercial representatives attending the meeting unanimously adopted a challenge to industrial and commercial circles in all provinces and cities across the country with five specific conditions. The challenge stated: We have clearly recognized that the interests of industrialists and businessmen today are inseparable from safeguarding the peace and independence of the motherland. Only by safeguarding the motherland and preventing it from being invaded can industry and commerce have the prospect of development and prosperity. The five competitive conditions proposed in the challenge are as follows: (1) Support the new tax law, publicize the new tax law, welcome the new tasks, strive to complete them ahead of schedule, and ensure the implementation of the principle of reasonable burden. (2) Ensure that tax payments are deposited into the treasury in a timely manner, with no delays. (3) Resolutely oppose tax evasion, concealment, and false accounting, and mutually supervise and evaluate each other. (4) Actively manage and cultivate tax sources. (5) Firmly strive to become a model province in tax payment in 1951.
