　　Qingdao Patriotic Christians and People from All Walks of Life
    Accuse 顾仁恩, a Scum in Christianity
    Expose His Crimes of Slandering the Government, Spreading Rumors to Confuse the Public, and Advocating for American Imperialism, and Demand the Government Punish Him Severely.
    [Our Newspaper] Recently, Qingdao Christians have been writing to the Qingdao Daily, accusing 顾仁恩, a degenerate in Christianity, of spreading rumors to confuse the public, fooling the people, and defaming the government. They demand that the People's Government immediately arrest him and punish him severely.
    顾仁恩, cloaked in religious garb, arrived in Qingdao from Shanghai on February 25th. He was "preaching" day and night at the Jining Road Baptist Church and the Longshan Road Meeting Place, claiming to be "acting on the orders of Jesus Christ to drive out demons and heal the sick." His "healing" method involved smearing olive oil on the patient's head and praying, after which "the illness would disappear as if lost." 顾 declared: "When I preached and healed in Shanghai, the Military Control Commission sent people to arrest me, but when I healed the patient, they had no choice but to retreat quietly. After I enlightened and guided a certain office of the Hangzhou Military Control Commission and a certain atheist, they both abandoned their evil thoughts and knelt before the cross of the Lord Jesus." 顾 used his defamation of the government to incite believers, saying, "As long as God is with me, even the great mountains and small hills that obstruct us can be moved!" 顾仁恩 also promoted the American aggressor troops in Korea and wantonly slandered the heroic Korean people. He said, "The American troops are heavenly soldiers and generals, and the Korean people who are bombed to death are paying for their sins in their previous lives."
    When 顾仁恩 first arrived in Qingdao, many Christians were deceived by his "healing and demon-expelling" claims, calling 顾 "the living Jesus." Many people listened to his sermons and sought treatment every day, spreading rumors that "顾仁恩 can really cure diseases." However, the truth that he was using "healing" to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda was quickly exposed by those seeking medical treatment. Wang Chong-sheng, residing at 218 South Zhongjiawa, Qingdao, who suffered from lameness, was once deceived and tricked by 顾仁恩, but he quickly came to his senses. He said, "顾 patted me on the head and told me to get up and walk. I got up but still couldn't walk. 顾仁恩 then said that I lacked faith and had people carry me outside. Dong Ji-ting, the Dean of the Baptist Theological Seminary, insisted that I was healed. They wanted to take a picture of me as a testimony, but I said I wasn't healed and couldn't take the picture. However, he told the crowd at 31 Jining Road that I was healed." Wang Feng-jun, residing at 42 Qidong Road, a Christian, had suffered from corneal opacity in both eyes since the age of sixteen. Full of hope, he went to 顾仁恩 for treatment on March 6th. Wang Feng-jun said, "At that time, I didn't feel any effect at all, and my bad eyes were still bad eyes. But because I was temporarily fooled by him, I deliberately concealed the truth and vigorously promoted him to others, serving as 顾仁恩's tool for spreading rumors..."
    Why was Wang Feng-jun deceived and used as 顾仁恩's tool for spreading rumors? It turned out that 顾仁恩 had a set of despicable methods for deceiving people. He told those seeking medical treatment: "The diseases of the human body are all caused by sins. Congenital diseases cannot be cured because God did not create them for you; acquired injuries cannot be cured because you have destroyed God's creative function; without praying day and night, without long-term fasting, without complete faith, your illness cannot be cured; if one of your family members does not believe in the Lord, or believes but lacks faith, your illness cannot be cured..." Left cannot be cured, right cannot be cured, only one type of person can be cured, that is, those who do not have serious illnesses and are deeply superstitious. When 顾仁恩 treated these people, he first smeared them with oil and prayed, asking them "Are you healed?" Fearing that others would say they lacked faith, they had to answer: "Healed." But even these people eventually exposed 顾仁恩's deception.
    The Christians in Qingdao are extremely angry at 顾仁恩's hooligan behavior, believing that he is "insulting the dignity of the church pulpit, it's simply outrageous!" They have written to the Qingdao Daily, suggesting that the government punish him severely, and demanding to know who instigated 顾仁恩 to confuse and harm people in the Qingdao churches, investigate the responsibility, and sanction them! Chen Zhi-zao, Director of the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, also responded to the questions of patriotic Christians Wang Zhi-kun and He Zhi-ren in the newspaper with scientific arguments, pointing out that 顾仁恩's claim that olive oil can cure blindness, lameness, deafness, muteness, and other diseases is a scientific fallacy and a deceptive trick; not to mention those with scientific and medical knowledge, even those with ordinary common sense can see through his trickery.
    Many Christians at Qilu University in Jinan also expressed their intolerance of 顾仁恩's crimes.
    顾仁恩 was originally a hooligan who, in the past, colluded with counter-revolutionary elements such as Shanghai's bullies, local ruffians, secret agents, and bandits to oppress the people. 顾仁恩 takes pride in his past shameful history. When preaching, he often flaunts things like "Back then, when the pistol came out, who wasn't afraid," and "Who doesn't love spending money like dirt," which are vile and shameless words.
    The Qingdao Municipal People's Government will, according to the people's demands, severely punish 顾仁恩.

　　青岛市爱国基督教徒暨各界人民
    控告基督教中的败类顾仁恩
    揭发其诽谤政府、谣言惑众、为美帝国主义张目的罪行，要求政府严惩。
    【本报讯】青岛市基督教徒最近纷纷投书青岛日报，控告基督教败类顾仁恩谣言惑众、愚弄人民、诋毁政府的罪恶行为，要求人民政府立即予以逮捕严办。
    披着宗教外衣的顾仁恩于二月二十五日由上海到青岛，在济宁路浸信会、龙山路聚会处昼夜“讲道”，自称“奉耶稣基督之命，赶鬼医病”。“治病”方法是以橄榄油抹患者头部，经祷告后，“病即若失”。顾宣称：“在上海讲道、治病时，军事管制委员会曾派人来捉，但当把病人治好后，他们便不得不悄然而退。杭州市军事管制委员会某处及某无神论者，经我开导引领后，都放下恶念，屈膝于主耶稣的十字架前。”顾借对政府的诋毁来煽惑教徒说：“只要有神与我在，阻碍我们的大山小山也能挪移！”顾仁恩并为在朝鲜的美国侵略军作宣传，还肆意诬蔑英勇斗争的朝鲜人民。他说：“美国军队是天兵天将，朝鲜人民被炸死是前生有罪。”
    顾仁恩到青岛之初，曾有不少基督教徒受了他“医病除鬼”的蒙骗，称顾为“活耶稣”；每日听讲求医者甚多，风言“顾仁恩真能治病”。但他假借“治病”进行反动宣传的真相，很快就被就医者彻底揭穿了。青岛市南仲家洼二一八号王重生，生了腿瘸的病，曾受顾仁恩欺骗捉弄，但他很快就清醒了过来，他说：“顾在我头上拍了一下，叫我起来走。我起来仍不能走。顾仁恩反说我信心不足，叫人架我到门外；浸信会神学院院长董吉亭就硬说我好了。当时叫我照像做见证，我说没好不能照，他却在济宁路三十一号对群众说我好了。”齐东路四十二号王凤君，是个基督教徒，自十六岁起两眼即患角膜翳。他满怀希望地于三月六日前往求顾仁恩医治。王凤君说：“当时我丝毫未感觉见效，坏眼仍是坏眼。但我因一时受了他的愚弄，有意隐蔽实情，竟向别人大肆宣传，充当了顾仁恩的造谣工具。……”
    为什么王凤君会受骗而充当了顾仁恩的造谣工具呢？原来顾仁恩有一套卑劣的骗人办法。他对就医者讲：“人身的疾病都是由罪恶而起。先天遗传病不能治，因为上帝没给你创造；后天残害也不能治，因为你破坏了上帝的创造功能；不昼夜祷告，不长期禁食，没有万分信心，有病也不能治好；家属亲人有一个不信主，或信主而信心不够也不能治好。……”左不能治，右不能治，只有给一种人能治，就是没有大病的，迷信很深的人。顾仁恩在给这种人治病时，首先就给他抹油祷告，问他“好了没有？”他怕别人说自己没有信心，于是只得答道：“好了。”但就是这种人，也最后拆穿了顾仁恩的骗术。
    青岛市基督教徒对顾仁恩的流氓行为极为愤怒，认为他是“侮辱礼拜堂讲台的尊严，简直不成体统！”他们纷纷致书青岛日报，建议政府予以严厉惩办，并要求追问是谁唆使顾仁恩在青岛教会中惑众害人，查清责任，制裁他们！青岛市人民政府卫生局陈志藻局长并以科学的论点，在报纸上答复了爱国基督教徒王志坤、何志仁的疑问，指出顾仁恩所谓橄榄油能治瞎、瘸、聋、哑等病，是一种违反科学的骗人伎俩；不用说具有科学、医学知识的人，就是稍有普通常识的人，亦可洞悉其奸。
    济南市齐鲁大学的不少基督教徒也对顾仁恩的罪行表示不能容忍。
    顾仁恩本为一流氓，过去曾与上海的恶霸、地痞及特务、土匪等反革命分子勾结一起，压榨人民。对于过去的丑恶历史，顾仁恩引以为荣。在讲道时，常摆弄什么“当年手枪出笼，谁人不怕”、“挥金如土，谁人不爱”等一类卑鄙无耻的话。
    青岛市人民政府将根据人民的要求，予顾仁恩以严厉制裁。
