　　Defend the Motherland's Beloved Children
　　American Imperialism Wants to Make Chinese Children Forget Their Motherland
　　To the Editor:
　　During the winter vacation, I had the opportunity to visit the "Canaan Orphanage" in Beijing. The means by which American imperialist elements mentally harm Chinese children here are extremely insidious and vicious. They used Hitler's songs to anesthetize the children's minds. They did not let the children know about New China. Today, the children don't even know who the leader of the Chinese people is. They ask: "Why haven't we heard of 'Chairman Chiang' lately?" They don't know what the national flag looks like or how to sing the national anthem. When I wanted to teach them to sing the national anthem, they actually replied: "Learning the national anthem is not good, it violates the will of the Lord." Once, I copied the song "The East is Red" on the blackboard to teach them to sing. Later, the song was erased, and the words "Please beware of the devil's tricks!" were written on the blackboard. The children generally have pro-American thoughts. They say that Americans saved them, so they must repay the "kindness." The orphanage also told the children: "Russia (the Soviet Union) is not good and should be eliminated." And they said: "We should listen to God's instructions and help America fight Russia."
　　The orphans are severely mistreated by the orphanage. There are no workers or nannies in the orphanage, and the older orphans take care of the younger orphans. The orphans have to do very heavy work. They have to get up at four o'clock every morning and keep busy until late at night without rest. The children say: "We are exhausted every day. But the assigned work must be completed, otherwise we will be punished." As a result, the children's physical development and health are greatly affected. The children's lives are very hard, and they cannot get any oil. I saw a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child who was sick, and the orphanage not only did not give him treatment, but also locked him in the toilet. In addition, about thirty children had rashes and did not receive treatment.
　　Doesn't this clearly show what American imperialism's so-called "relief," "friendship," and "charitable undertakings" in China are all about!

　　The Painful Life I Cannot Forget
　　To the Editor:
　　I entered the "Canaan Orphanage" in the winter of 1938 and did not leave until December 13, 1948. I cannot forget the painful life that Chinese children lived in the "Canaan Orphanage."
　　Between 1942 and 1943, the director, Nie Shouguang, raped two older orphan girls. Afterwards, he sent them to the Catholic "Ren Ci Tang," from where they were forcibly married to Tianjin, and their whereabouts are unknown.
　　The orphanage often used economic difficulties as an excuse to not let us eat enough. When we were extremely hungry, we had to pick some wild vegetables to fill our stomachs in the summer. However, the large amount of orphanage living expenses donated from various places was embezzled by the orphanage. Sometimes we cried because we were hungry, and the director's lackeys, Wang Aiguang and Zhao Ailing, would beat us. If we did something that they didn't like, we would be beaten and punished, and they would threaten us with hunger. Several times, they didn't allow more than half of the orphans in the entire orphanage to eat. Some children were punished for three or four meals in a row and were not allowed to eat, and as a result, they became sick from hunger.
　　There are still one hundred and fourteen orphans in the "Canaan Orphanage." American imperialist elements not only mistreat them but also carry out enslavement education on them, making them forget their motherland. I hope the government will liberate them as soon as possible.

　　My Child Was Killed by Them!
　　--Reader Ling Feng Writes to Accuse the Crimes of the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home"
　　To the Editor:
　　When I saw the news in the People's Daily exposing the incidents of imperialist pseudo-charitable organizations such as the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home" harming our country's children, I couldn't help but think of my child, Dongsheng, who died in the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home."
　　In July 1948, I was forced by life to painfully entrust Dongsheng, who was six months old, to the "Sacred Heart Children's Home" for foster care. At that time, after my repeated pleas, they agreed to foster the child until he was four years old.
　　However, less than a week after I sent the child there, I suddenly received a notice from the "Sacred Heart Children's Home" saying that Dongsheng's "condition was serious." I was very anxious at the time, thinking that when the child went there, he was so healthy and lively, how could he suddenly become seriously ill? I immediately went to see Dongsheng. When I arrived at the hospital, the guard said, "The time is over," and would not let me see him. The next day, I went at the time they specified. I waited a long time at the door, and then a person came out and told me, "Dongsheng is dead." I almost fainted when I heard that. I asked to see Dongsheng's body. The man sneered and said, "It's already buried, what's the point of looking at it!"
　　Editor: My Dongsheng, a living child who could play and laugh, died inexplicably only a week after entering the "Sacred Heart Children's Home." For more than two years, I still didn't know how he died! Today, after reading the news in the newspaper, I realized: my child was killed by them! They use "charity" as a cover to do evil things. I will never forget that my child was killed by this kind of murderous "charitable" organization of imperialism. I want to file a complaint against their crimes and demand that the government severely punish those executioners who killed Chinese children.

　　Imperialism's "Charitable" Undertakings are Tools for Slaughtering the Chinese People
　　To the Editor:
　　I read the news in the People's Daily about the Guangzhou "Holy Infant Nursery" and the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home" and "Loving Mother and Infant Nursery" harming our country's children to my mother. My mother was very sad after hearing it. She walked into the inner room and took out a photo. This is a photo of my younger brother who was stabbed to death by Japanese devils with bayonets when he was three years old. She looked at this photo; then picked up the photo of the infants harmed by the imperialist "charitable" organizations in the People's Daily on March 9. Without me explaining anything to her, she clearly knew: imperialism's "charitable undertakings" in China, just like their bayonets, are tools for slaughtering the Chinese people. My mother told me: "Ting'er, write a letter to the People's Daily for me, asking the People's Government to avenge us." After she finished saying this, she cried with excitement.
　　Editor, I believe that all the mothers in China, like my mother, will recognize the crimes of imperialism from these facts and demand that the government severely punish these murderers who harm Chinese children under the guise of "charity."
　　Yu Ting
　　Editor's Note: After this newspaper exposed the incidents of the Guangzhou "Holy Infant Nursery" and the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home" and "Loving Mother and Infant Nursery" harming our country's children, readers Wang Tongxun and Tao Enguang wrote again to expose the crimes of the Beijing "Canaan Orphanage" in mistreating Chinese children and carrying out enslavement education on Chinese children. From these facts, we can clearly see the true face of imperialist "charitable" undertakings. The people of New China can never tolerate this kind of criminal behavior of imperialism.

　　保卫祖国可爱的儿童
    美帝国主义要使中国儿童忘记自己的祖国编辑同志：
    在寒假期内，我有机会访问了北京“迦南孤儿院”。在这里美帝国主义分子在精神上残害中国儿童的手段是非常阴险毒辣的。他们曾用希特勒的歌曲来麻醉儿童们的思想。他们不让孩子们知道关于新中国的事情。在今天，孩子们竟连中国人民的领袖是谁还不知道。他们问：“现在怎么没有听说‘蒋主席’了？”他们不知道国旗是什么样子、国歌怎样唱。我要教他们唱国歌时，他们竟回答：“学国歌不好，违背了主的意志。”有一次，我在黑板上抄上了“东方红”的歌子教他们唱。后来，歌子被擦去了，黑板上写上了“请诸位要防备魔鬼的鬼计！”几个大字。儿童们普遍存在着亲美思想。他们说美国人救活了他们，所以要报“恩”。院方还向孩子们说：“俄国（苏联）不好，应该消灭他。”并且说：“我们应该听神的指示，帮助美国打俄国。”
    孤儿们受到院方严重的虐待。院中没有工友和褓姆，由大孤儿看管小孤儿。孤儿们必须做十分烦重的工作。他们每天早晨四点多钟就得起床，一直忙到晚，不得休息。儿童们说：“每天累得不行。可是分配的工作必须作完，不然要受处罚。”因此，儿童们身体的发育和健康受到很大影响。儿童们的生活非常苦，吃不到一点油脂。我看到一个十三四岁的孩子有了病，院方不但不给治疗，反把他禁闭在厕所里。另外约有三十个小孩出了疹子，也没有得到治疗。
    这不是清楚地说明了美帝国主义对中国人民的所谓“救济”、“友谊”以及他们在中国所办的“慈善事业”究竟是怎么一回事！

    我不能忘记的惨痛生活编辑同志：
    我在一九三八年冬入“迦南孤儿院”，直到一九四八年十二月十三日才离开那里。我不能忘掉中国儿童在“迦南孤儿院”所过的惨痛生活。
    在一九四二——一九四三年间，院长聂受光奸污了两个年纪较大的孤女。事后，他就将她们送入天主教的“仁慈堂”，由那里把她们强嫁到天津去，就此下落不明。
    院方常常借口经济困难，不让我们吃饱饭。我们饿极了，在夏天只得摘些野菜充饥。而各处捐来的大量孤儿生活费却被院方贪污了。有时我们饿得哭了，院长的走狗王爱光和赵爱龄就打我们。我们稍为做了一些不合他们意的事，就要挨打受罚，用饿来威胁我们。有好几次，他们不许全院一大半孤儿吃饭。有的孩子接连被罚三四顿不许吃饭，结果就饿病了。
    “迦南孤儿院”现在还有一百十四个孤儿。美国帝国主义分子不但虐待他们，并向他们进行奴化教育，使他们忘记自己的祖国。我希望政府赶快把他们解放出来。

    我的孩子是被他们害死的！
    ——读者凌风来信控诉南京“圣心儿童院”的罪恶编辑同志：
    当我看到人民日报揭露南京“圣心儿童院”等帝国主义伪慈善机关残害我国儿童事件的新闻时，我不由想起我那死在南京“圣心儿童院”的孩子冬生来。
    一九四八年七月，我为生活所迫，忍痛把生下六个月的冬生寄养在“圣心儿童院”。当时经我再三怜告，他们才答应把孩子寄养到四岁。
    但是，我把孩子送进去不到一个礼拜，却突然接到“圣心儿童院”的通知，说冬生“病况严重”。我当时很着急，想到孩子去的时候，还是那么健康，活泼，怎么一下就得了重病？我立即就去看冬生。赶到了该院，看门的说“时间过了”，不让我看。第二天，我按他们规定的时间去看。在门口等了很久，后来出来一个人告我说：“冬生已死了。”我听了差一点晕过去。我要求看冬生的尸体。那人却冷笑一声说：“埋都埋了，还看什么！”
    编辑同志：我的冬生，一个活生生的孩子，会玩会笑，进入“圣心儿童院”才一个星期，竟就糊里糊涂地死了。两年多来，我还一直不知道他是怎样死的！今天，看了报纸上的新闻，我才明白了：我的孩子是被他们害死的！他们拿“慈善”当幌子，做着罪恶的事情。我永远忘不了，我的孩子就是被帝国主义这种杀人的“慈善”机关所害死的。我要对他们这种罪行提出控诉，要求政府严办那些残杀中国儿童的刽子手们。

    帝国主义的“慈善”事业是屠杀中国人民的工具编辑同志：
    我把人民日报关于广州“圣婴婴院”和南京“圣心儿童院”、“慈爱育婴院”残害我国儿童的新闻念给我母亲听。母亲听了之后很难过。她走进里屋，拿出一张照片。这是在三岁时就被日本鬼子用刺刀刺死的我弟弟的照片。她看看这张照片；又拿起三月九日人民日报上被帝国主义“慈善”机关所残害的婴儿的照片。不用我再向她作任何解释，她就很清楚地知道：帝国主义在中国的“慈善事业”，正像它们的刺刀一样，是屠杀中国人民的工具。母亲嘱咐我：“亭儿，替我写信给人民日报，要求人民政府给咱们报仇。”她说完这句话，激动得哭了。
    编辑同志，我相信：全中国的母亲，和我母亲一样，会从这些事实认识帝国主义的罪恶，并要求政府严惩这些挂着“慈善”牌子而残害中国儿童的凶手。

   编者按：本报揭发了广州“圣婴婴院”和南京“圣心儿童院”、“慈爱育婴院”残害我国儿童事件后，读者王同勋、陶恩光又来信揭发北京“迦南孤儿院”虐害中国儿童并对中国儿童施行奴化教育的罪恶事实。从这些事实中，我们可以清楚地看到帝国主义“慈善”事业的真面目。新中国人民对帝国主义这种罪恶行为是决不能容忍的。
