　　Deputy Director of the Supervision Department of the Supreme People's Court
    Comrade Li Shengqi Passes Away
    Shen Junru and Others Form Funeral Committee
    Comrade Li Shengqi, Deputy Director of the Supervision Department of the Supreme People's Court, passed away at 21:15 on March 14th at Beijing Hospital due to heart disease despite medical treatment. A funeral committee composed of sixteen people including Shen Junru, Wu Gaizhi, Zhang Zhirang, and Yi Jiaju has been formed. A memorial service will be held at Jiaxing Temple, No. 64, West Huangchenggen, at 2:00 PM on the 16th, followed by a funeral procession to the Cemetery of Revolutionary Martyrs. Comrade Li Shengqi was a native of Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province, and was 38 years old this year. He joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in 1927 and joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in his hometown in the spring of 1930. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1933. In the twenty-five years since Comrade Li Shengqi participated in the revolution, he personally experienced the three great historical periods of the Chinese people's revolution—the Ten-Year Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War. In the people's army and revolutionary regime, he served as county party secretary, security director, and security minister of the army and corps, consistently demonstrating the noble qualities of a Communist Party member who was brave, loyal, and worked hard for the people's cause. He was wounded twice in the revolutionary war and suffered from overwork in the long years of war. In April of last year, Comrade Li Shengqi was transferred from the 19th Army to serve as the Deputy Director of the Supervision Department of the Supreme People's Court. In order to quickly become familiar with and master this new job, he worked extremely hard. In November, a doctor's examination revealed a serious heart condition, and he was admitted to Beijing Hospital. After more than five months of treatment, his condition was too severe to be saved. Comrade Li Shengqi contributed his entire life to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, and his untimely death is a loss to the Chinese people.
