Party Life

To the Editors:

We are reporting the handling of the incident involving Fu Yuebo (previously incorrectly reported as Fu Tongbo), acting secretary of the NanZhao District Committee, suppressing criticism, and the theft of relief materials by cadres in the district (see page 3 of this newspaper, February 20th), along with our self-criticism, as follows:

Since November of last year, our county's NanZhao District has received three batches of relief materials for disaster victims, which were entrusted to Xu Xinmin, deputy district construction member, for safekeeping. During the distribution process, Xu Xinmin secretly stole nine pieces of clothing, one overcoat, and one pair of shoes. Zhang Liangfu, the civil affairs district member, also secretly exchanged five pieces on December 19th. Even the acting district committee secretary, Fu Yuebo, said to Zhang: "I'll exchange two pieces of the good ones too!" So Zhang Liangfu exchanged two pieces for Fu. Because the district committee secretary was exchanging them, other cadres followed suit. At first, it was secret exchanges, but later everyone started exchanging openly. In total, 21 people stole, exchanged, or bought them in a disguised manner, totaling 56 pieces. At the time, some comrades in the district opposed this, especially several district committee members, who firmly opposed it and wanted Fu Yuebo to immediately correct this erroneous phenomenon. However, Fu considered it a minor matter and repeatedly delayed handling it. These district committee members persisted in their views, and Fu Yuebo only dealt with it lightly. (Editor's Note: These district committee members demonstrated their ability to uphold the Party's principles in this matter and should be commended by the Party.)

Zhang Liangfu usually had a very bad work style and often quarreled with others. After the Anhui Northern Daily exposed his exchange of clothes, Zhang Liangfu cursed the writer as "lacking virtue"; later, when he found out that it was the cultural and educational cadre Gao Jianyi who wrote it, he cursed for two consecutive days. He was really making too much of a scene, so the county committee began to pay attention to handling it. At that time, because the county committee members had to go to the Fuyang Prefectural Committee and Zhengyangguan for meetings, they only called the district committee to handle it. Although Fu Yuebo made a self-criticism at the meeting, admitting that it was wrong to secretly exchange relief materials, and decided that all those who had secretly exchanged things should return them to the disaster victims, he did not truly solve the problem ideologically. Therefore, he still criticized the writer for "filing a black complaint" with the newspaper.

After the matter was exposed, our county was holding its Fifth People's Representative Conference, and the conference used this specific example to conduct criticism and self-criticism, educating cadres. In particular, when discussing the distribution of relief materials, cadres and representatives all checked their work in connection with their own jobs. The county committee also made a self-criticism on this matter.

On February 28th, the Fuyang Prefectural Committee and we both sent people to NanZhao District to handle this matter. First, we convened the district committee to mobilize everyone to study the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals." Comrade Fu Yuebo and the district committee members all made self-criticisms at the meeting. Then, we convened a meeting of all district staff and township cadres; Comrade Fu Yuebo made a self-criticism, and criticism and self-criticism were conducted at the meeting, strictly pointing out that this behavior of stealing and exchanging relief materials and suppressing criticism violated Party discipline, and formulating future work disciplines.

After the meeting, based on the above facts, after discussion and approval by the CCP Fuyang Local Committee, we gave Comrade Fu Yuebo a public warning within the Party. Zhang Liangfu, the civil affairs district member of the district government, and Xu Xinmin, the deputy district construction member, were also given two major demerits each with the approval of the Fuyang Commissioner's Office after being reported by the Yingshang County People's Government. All relief materials that were embezzled, stolen, exchanged, or forcibly bought were returned to the disaster victims, and the embezzlers apologized to the people.

At the same time, we also made the following self-criticism: First, as pointed out in the People's Daily short commentary: "It takes arduous ideological struggle to implement the Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals throughout the Party." In the past year, the Anhui Northern Daily has published five articles criticizing our county's work and cadres, but we have only responded to three times. This is because there is a common practice among our county's cadres of reporting only the good news and not the bad, liking the newspaper to praise themselves, and not welcoming criticism of their work and style. Therefore, they nitpick at articles that criticize them. If there are slight discrepancies with the facts in the criticism, they use the excuse that "the newspaper does not understand the situation" to oppose the criticism. For example, last year, Comrade Xu Ming of the TianJiaAn transit station raised some opinions on our county's grain transportation work, although there were some discrepancies with the facts, it was still correct to raise the opinions in a timely manner. Our county's grain bureau did not conduct a self-criticism on this, nor did it reply to the newspaper, and the county committee did not supervise it, so it was simply ignored. After the Central Committee announced the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" last year, many cadres in our county developed a negative attitude of "being careful" and "not wanting to be reported in the newspaper," without correctly understanding the spirit of the Central Committee's decision. This, of course, inevitably leads to a bureaucratic attitude of ignoring criticism, or even carrying out attacks, retaliation, and suppression against critics. After the Central Committee issued the decision on launching criticism and self-criticism, the county committee did not repeatedly educate the cadres, so this decision still cannot be implemented, and the county committee is responsible.

In fact, not only did Comrade Fu Yuebo not seriously study such an important decision of the Central Committee, but also some comrades in other districts, and even in the county, lacked in-depth research on the various instructions and policies of the Central Committee. Some cadres can go a month without reading the newspaper, "burying themselves" in work. Even worse, individual comrades emphasize that they are busy with work, and only look at the headlines of newspapers and superiors' instructions, thinking that they have already studied them. Last spring, the decision on unified management of fiscal revenue and expenditure for 1950, passed by the 25th meeting of the Government Administration Council, was already published in the newspaper, but many cadres in our county did not know about it. Thus, at the Fourth People's Representatives Conference in September last year, when representatives of the business community raised this decision, the cadres did not know what it was about. These facts are enough to alarm us. In the future, we will strengthen the earnest study and research of the Party and the People's Government's policies, decisions, and superiors' instructions in order to do a good job.

Our county committee has a serious bureaucratic work style and a complacent attitude, especially in handling the NanZhao District issue. After the Anhui Northern Daily published the NanZhao District's theft of relief materials incident, the county committee only spoke about it at the Youth League District Committee meeting, and still did not quickly handle it; later, it only telegraphed the district committee to handle it. The county committee only satisfies itself with assigning work, without conducting inspections, and therefore cannot discover and correct the bad phenomenon of reporting only the good news and not the bad news in a timely manner. It has failed to handle the voices or opinions from the masses or lower-level cadres in a timely manner, which has further fostered the arrogant and unreasonable work style of individual cadres, causing losses to the Party and the people. This inspection not only found that certain cadres at the district level in NanZhao District were severely corrupt, but also found that certain township cadres in the district were also very seriously corrupt. This inspection is very beneficial to our work. Now, the relief materials that have not yet been distributed in some places have been quickly distributed.

The above is our handling and self-criticism of the NanZhao District incident. Please advise if there is anything inappropriate.

### 中共皖北颍上县委员会  对南照区委压制批评的处理与检讨

　　中共皖北颍上县委员会
    对南照区委压制批评的处理与检讨编辑同志：
    现将我们对南照区代理区委书记傅月波（前报载误为傅同波）压制批评及该区干部偷换救济物资事件（见本报二月二十日三版）的处理情形与我们的检讨，报告如下：
    从去年十一月份起，我县南照区连续领回三次救济灾民的物资，交由该区建设副区员徐新民负责保管。在领发过程中，徐新民私自窃藏衣服九件、大衣一件、鞋子一双。民政区员张良辅也在十二月十九日，偷换了五件。就是代理区委书记傅月波同志也对张说：“有好的我也换两件！”张良辅便替傅换了两件。由于区委书记也换了，其他干部也就跟着换了。开始还是偷换，后来大家公开换开了。总计偷换、变相买的共有二十一人，共换了五十六件。当时区里有些同志反对，特别是几个区委委员，坚决反对，要傅月波立即纠正这种错误现象。但傅认为这是一件小事，一再拖延不处理。这几个区委委员就坚持自己意见，傅月波才轻描淡写地处理了一下（编者按：这几个区委委员，在这一件事情上，表现了能够坚持党的原则，应该受到党的表扬）。
    张良辅平常作风就很坏，常常和别人吵架。皖北日报揭发了他换衣服的事情后，张良辅便大骂写稿人“缺德”；后来发觉是文教干事高建仪写的，一连骂了两天。他实在闹得太不像样了，县委才开始注意处理。当时因县委委员都要去阜阳地委会和正阳关开会，所以只是打电话叫区委会处理。傅月波在会议上，虽然检讨了自己偷换救济物资不对，也决定了所有偷换了东西的一律退出来，发给灾民，但是并没有真正从思想上解决问题，因此仍批评写稿人不该到报社“告黑状”。
    事情被揭发后，我县正召开第五次各界人民代表会，会议上即以此具体事例，进行了批评与自我批评，教育干部，特别是讨论到发放救济物资工作时，干部及代表都联系自己的工作作了检查。县委对此事也作了检讨。
    二月二十八日，阜阳地委和我们均派人到南照区处理这件事情。首先召开区委会，发动大家学习中共中央颁布的“在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”。傅月波同志和区委委员在会上都作了检讨。接着召开全区工作人员会及乡干部会议；由傅月波同志作检讨，会上并进行批评与自我批评，严格指出这种偷换救济物资与压制批评的行为是违反党的纪律的，并订出了今后的工作纪律。
    会后，我们根据以上事实，经讨论决定并呈报中共阜阳地方委员会批准，在党内，给傅月波同志以当众警告处分。区政府民政区员张良辅及建设副区员徐新民也经颍上县人民政府呈报阜阳专员公署批准，给予各记大过二次处分。所有贪污偷换或强买的救济物资，如数退还灾民，并由贪污者向人民道歉。
    同时，我们也作了如下检讨：首先，正如人民日报短评中所指出的：“要在全党实行中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定是需要一番艰苦的思想斗争”。一年来皖北日报曾五次刊出批评我县工作及干部的文章，而我们只答复了三次。这因为我县干部普遍存在着报喜不报忧的作风，喜欢报纸表扬自己，而不欢迎批评自己的工作和作风。因此对批评自己的稿子，则斤斤计较。批评中稍有与事实出入的，便借口“报社不了解情况”反对批评。例如去年田家庵转运站徐明同志对我县粮食转运工作提出了一些意见，虽然与事实有些出入，但是能够及时提出意见还是正确的。我县粮食局对这并没有进行检讨，也没有答复报社，县委也没有督促，就这样置之不理了。去年中央公布了“在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”后，我县不少干部产生了“小心些”、“可别上了报”的消极态度，而没有正确认识中央决定的精神。这样当然难免产生对批评置之不理，甚至对批评者实行打击、报复与压制的官僚主义态度。中央发布关于展开批评与自我批评决定后，县委并没有反复地在干部中进行教育，因此这一决定至今还不能贯彻，县委是要负责的。
    实际上，在我县不仅傅月波同志对中央这样重要的决定没有认真学习，其他区甚至县里有些同志，对中央的各项指示和政策，也都缺乏深入的研究。有些干部可以一个月不看报纸，“埋头”工作。更恶劣的是个别同志强调工作忙，对报纸与上级的指示，只看一下大标题，就认为已经学习过了。去年春天，政务院二十五次会议通过的关于统一管理一九五○年度财政收支的决定，早已在报上公布，但我县许多干部都不知道。这样在去年九月份的第四次各界代表会上，当工商界的代表提出这个决定时，干部都不知道是怎么一回事。这些事实已够我们警惕了。今后我们要加强对党和人民政府的政策、决定及上级指示认真的学习研究，以作好工作。
    我们县委是存在着严重的官僚主义作风与骄傲自满情绪的，特别是在处理南照区的问题上。当皖北日报登出南照区的偷换救济物资事件后，县委只是在青年团区委书记会上讲了讲，仍未迅速处理；后来也只是电告区委处理。县委只满足于布置工作，不进行检查，因而对下边报喜不报忧的恶劣现象，也就不可能及时发现与纠正。对来自群众中或下级干部的呼声或意见，未能及时处理，更助长了个别干部的骄傲蛮横作风，造成对党对人民的损失。这次检查不只发现了南照区区级机关某些干部贪污严重，并发现了该区某些乡干部贪污亦很严重。这种检查对我们工作是十分有利的。现在有些地方尚未发完的救济物资，都已赶快发下去了。
    以上是我们对南照区事件的处理及检讨，是否有当还请指示。
