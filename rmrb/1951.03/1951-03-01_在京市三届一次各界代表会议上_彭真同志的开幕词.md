Comrade Peng Zhen's Opening Speech at the First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference

Chairman, fellow representatives, honored guests:

Now, the First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference is open! We celebrate the success of the conference!

This session, like the previous one, is still a people's representative conference that exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress. However, the method of electing representatives has taken another step forward compared to the previous session. The representatives of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and higher education institutions are now directly elected by voter assemblies based on production units or schools. Representatives of farmers, industry and commerce, youth, women, and regions are generally elected by representative conferences. These two categories of representatives account for 83% of the total number of representatives. In addition, there are specially invited representatives with full representativeness, recommended by the previous Consultative Committee and appointed by the Municipal People's Government, as well as representatives of the Municipal Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government. A representative conference elected in this way will surely be able to successfully complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the people of the city.

The task of this representative conference is to listen to and review the work report of the Municipal People's Government, decide on the policy direction for this year, and elect the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the Municipal People's Government.

What are the main tasks we should focus on this year? The previous Consultative Committee exchanged views on this issue. I would now like to present these views for the consideration of the conference.

I. We must deeply promote the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. We must thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces and influence of the imperialists. To achieve this goal, we must further popularize and deepen the anti-American patriotic movement, so that every citizen consciously and actively participates in this movement; so that everyone can receive education in anti-American struggle and patriotism.

II. We must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants, eliminate spies, bandits, local bullies, and reactionary Taoist and gang organizations, and further consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital, to ensure the smooth progress of various construction projects in the capital and protect the safety of the people's lives and property. This is a major task of the People's Government, and it is also the task of every citizen. We must thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary remnants.

III. We must further build democratic power. All district and suburban people's governments, and village people's governments, should be produced through elections by people's representative conferences this year. That is to say, all levels of government in Beijing should implement democratic elections this year.

IV. We must thoroughly reorganize the social economy in accordance with the needs of the domestic market, reorganize Beijing's industry, and make it primarily produce to meet the needs of farmers. We must also vigorously develop urban-rural trade, so that the city's industry can be developed on the basis of worker-peasant mutual assistance and urban-rural mutual assistance, finding a way out for the city's industry and also finding a way out for farmers' surplus agricultural products. To solve this problem, we need to carry out a lot of investigation and organizational work.

We must rely on the efforts of all workers to develop production, further improve the management of state-owned factories, implement economic accounting systems, and further improve product quality and output, and reduce their costs.

Last year, agricultural production in the suburbs increased by 18% compared to the past, which is a great achievement. This year, we must earnestly develop labor mutual assistance, organize ourselves, and strive to increase production by another 5% to 10%.

V. We must further improve and enhance school education. Develop adult education, and increase technical education in adult schools. And further develop and popularize cultural and recreational activities for the working people.

This year, we must make every effort to repair school buildings, first and foremost the classrooms.

Factories and schools must pay attention to the health of workers and students. Chairman Mao has emphasized to us the importance of paying attention to the health of workers and students. To solve this problem, we must formulate various specific measures to ensure the health of workers and students in all aspects.

VI. Our municipal construction policy remains to serve the central government agencies, to serve production, and to serve the working people, first and foremost to serve the workers. However, this year's municipal construction funds are relatively small, so we can only carry out some relatively urgent construction, and carry out some maintenance and repair work on the existing sewers and roads. We will strive to solve the drainage problems in the urban areas that were flooded during the rainy season last year, and in the suburban areas where farmland was flooded, and repair roads that are heavily trafficked and muddy when it rains. Environmental sanitation must be greatly improved, and epidemic prevention work must be greatly developed. This year, we should strive to provide tap water for 1.3 million to 1.4 million people.

VII. Housing problem. Many houses in the capital were already dilapidated, and the population of the capital has increased to 2.2 million, so a serious housing shortage has occurred, and the lives of some working people and public employees have been affected as a result. This is a manifestation of the fact that the speed of housing construction in the capital cannot keep up with the speed of population growth and industrial and commercial development, and it is one of the difficulties we encounter in our development. Under the current conditions of financial difficulty, we propose to take the following measures to solve this problem:

① The Municipal People's Government should mobilize and organize public and private forces to strive to build 15,000 to 20,000 houses (excluding houses built by central government agencies). To achieve this plan, we should organize joint public-private real estate companies to build a large number of houses for sale or rent.

Secondly, we should guide and help larger state-owned and private factories to build some staff dormitories, first to solve the accommodation problems of workers who live far from the factories, to reduce the waste of labor, improve production efficiency, and improve the lives of some workers.

In addition, we should reward private individuals for building houses for rent; guide and help workers and other classes of people to establish housing cooperatives, pooling their wisdom and efforts to build some houses for their own use.

In short, we must use various methods to strive to build 15,000 to 20,000 houses to reduce the housing shortage in the capital.

② We must make full use of last year's experience to organize public and private forces to repair houses in a timely manner. All houses that should be repaired must be repaired in a timely manner, and must not be allowed to be damaged. The government's competent departments must be responsible for inspection and supervision.

③ Reasonable adjustments should be made to rents that are too high or too low. Rents that are too high should be lowered, and rents that are too low should be appropriately raised. Landlords should be able to make a profit, but tenants should not be burdened too heavily.

We should adopt appropriate measures to reward the renting out of spare rooms.

VIII. The government should continue to establish more clinics for the working people, and should guide, help and force factories and workshops with more than 30 people, especially large factories, to establish health clinics or small hospitals independently or jointly. A surgical hospital should be jointly established by public and private enterprises in the Mentougou mining area. Like building staff dormitories, this is beneficial to both the factory and the workers. The current business situation of industry and commerce is good, and we believe that this can be done.

These tasks are proposed based on current needs and possible conditions. There are many tasks we should do, and we can only carry them out in a focused manner. To do more with less money, we must rely on the combined efforts of the public and private sectors, careful calculation, and the unity and mutual assistance of all the people, especially relying on the workers to give full play to their high level of enthusiasm and creativity, in order to complete such an arduous task.

### 在京市三届一次各界代表会议上  彭真同志的开幕词

　　在京市三届一次各界代表会议上
    彭真同志的开幕词主席、各位代表、各位来宾：
    现在，我们北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议开幕了，我们庆祝会议的成功！
    本届会议，仍然和上届一样，是代行人民代表大会职权的人民代表会议，但在代表的产生方法上，已经又比上届代表会议前进了一步。各公营工矿企业的代表、专科以上学校的代表，现在已经做到以生产或学校为单位，由选民大会直接选举了。农民代表、工商界、青年、妇女代表和区域代表等，已经普遍做到由代表会议选举了。以上两类代表，已达代表总数的百分之八十三。此外，就是经过上届协商委员会协商，由市人民政府聘请的具有充分代表性的特邀代表和市军管会及市人民政府的代表。经过这样选举产生的代表会议，一定能够圆满地完成全市人民所付予我们的光荣任务。
    这一次代表会议的任务，是听取与审查市人民政府的工作报告，决定本年度的施政方针，选举市长、副市长和市人民政府委员。
    今年我们主要的应该做些什么工作呢？上届协商委员会曾就这个问题，交换过意见。我现在把这些意见提出，请大会考虑。
    一、我们要深入地开展抗美援朝运动。把帝国主义者的残余势力和残余的影响，肃清得干干净净。为了达到这个目的，我们就必须更加普及与深入反美爱国运动，使每个市民都自觉地积极地参加这个运动；使每一个人都能够受到反美斗争和爱国主义的教育。
    二、我们要坚决镇压反革命活动，肃清反革命残余，肃清特务、土匪、恶霸和反动道门帮会，进一步巩固首都的革命秩序，以保障首都各项建设的顺利进行，保障人民生命财产的安全。这是人民政府的重大任务，也是全体市民每一个人的任务，我们必须把一切反革命残余肃清得干干净净。
    三、我们要进一步建设民主政权。所有的城区和郊区人民政府、村人民政府，今年一律要经过人民代表会议的选举来产生。就是说，北京市的各级政府，今年应一律实行民主选举。
    四、我们要按照国内市场的需要，彻底改组社会经济，改组北京市的工业，使它主要为满足农民需要而生产。并且大力开展城乡贸易，这样才能在工农互助、城乡互助的基础上发展城市的工业，为城市的工业找到出路，也为农民多余的农产品找到出路。为了解决这个问题，我们需要进行许多的调查工作和组织工作。
    我们要依靠全体工人的努力发展生产，更加改善公营工厂的管理，实行经济核算制；更加提高产品质量和产量，并减低其成本。
    去年郊区的农业生产比过去增加了产量百分之十八，这是很大的成绩。今年要切实发展劳动互助，组织起来，争取再增加产量百分之五到百分之十。
    五、我们要进一步改进与提高学校教育。发展业余教育，在业余学校中增加技术教育。并且更加开展、普及劳动人民的文化娱乐活动。
    今年要尽最大努力修缮校舍，首先是教室。
    工厂、学校一定要注意工人、学生的健康。毛主席曾着重地指示我们注意工人和学生的健康。为了解决这个问题，我们必须订出各种具体办法，从各方面保证工人和学生的健康。
    六、我们的市政建设方针仍然是为中央各机关，为生产，为劳动人民服务，首先是为工人服务。但今年市政建设经费比较少，因此只能进行一些比较紧急的建设，并对已有的下水道和道路等作一些保养修整的工作。争取解决去年雨季中城内积水淹房地区及郊区积水淹田地区的排水问题，整修行人众多、遇雨泥泞的道路。环境卫生要大大改善，防疫工作要大大开展。今年应争取自来水能供给一百三十万至一百四十万人的用水。
    七、房屋问题。首都有很多房屋本来早已破烂不堪，而首都的人口又已增加到二百二十万，因此房屋已发生严重的恐慌，一部分劳动人民和公教人员的生活已因此受到影响。这是首都房屋增建的速度，赶不上人口增加及工商业发展速度的表现，是我们在发展中遇到的困难之一。在目前财政仍然困难的条件下，我们提议采取下列办法来解决这个问题：
    ①市人民政府应动员与组织公私力量，为增建一万五千到两万间房屋而奋斗（中央各机关修建之房屋在外）。为了实现这一计划，我们应该组织公私合资的房产公司，以便大量地修建房屋，出售或出租。
    其次，应指导、帮助较大的公营和私营工厂，修建一部分工房，首先解决距离工厂较远的工人的住宿问题，以减少劳动力的浪费，提高生产效率，并改善部分工人的生活。
    此外，应奖励私人盖房出租；指导与帮助工人群众或其他阶层人民，建立房屋合作社，群策群力，修盖一部分房屋自住。
    总之，要用各种办法来争取增建一万五千至两万间房屋以减少首都的房荒。
    ②要充分利用去年的经验，组织公私力量及时修缮房屋。一切应修的房屋，必须及时修理，不得听任其破坏。政府主管部门必须负责检查与督促。
    ③对于过高或过低的房租，应加以合理调整。过高的房租应降低，过低的应适当提高。要使房产主有利可图，但也不能使房客负担过重。
    我们应该采用适当的办法奖励余房出租。
    八、政府应继续为劳动人民增设诊疗所，应指导帮助并强制三十人以上的工厂、作坊、特别是大工厂单独或联合设立卫生所或小型医院。在门头沟矿区应由公私企业合资创办一所外科医院。这和修盖工房一样，对厂方和工人都是有利的。现在工商业营业状况较好，我们认为这是可以办到的。
    这些工作，是根据当前的需要和可能的条件提出的。我们应该做的工作很多，只能有重点地进行。我们要用较少的经费，做更多的事情，就必须依靠公私合力、精打细算，依靠全体人民的团结互助，特别是要依靠工人群众发扬高度的积极性和创造性，才能完成这样艰巨的任务。
