　　CCP Ji County County Committee Propaganda Minister
    Indiscriminately Attacks Critics

To the Editor:

    After the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page published the critical letter "Cadres of Leitou Village, Second District, Ji County, Compel Opera Performances, Waste Food and Drink" on January 24th, not only did the village cadres of Leitou Village not seriously accept the criticism and examine their shortcomings, but Liu Xiaojian, the Propaganda Minister of the CCP Ji County County Committee, also expressed extreme dissatisfaction with this criticism. He indiscriminately protected the actions of the Leitou Village cadres that harmed the interests of the masses, and attacked those who represented the opinions of the masses and put forward criticisms.

    That letter was written by me based on the opinions of all the masses in Leitou Village, so the village cadres retaliated against me. One evening, they sent two security guards to my home, who said in a very strong tone: "The village office is calling for you!" I asked the security guards "What's the matter?" The reply was: "Don't you know what you've done?" I didn't go that night because I was ill (I only found out the next day that it was about the matter of being published in the newspaper). The next day, under the manipulation of a few village cadres, all the village cadres went to the Second District Government to petition, resisting the criticism by demanding their resignation. Hu Shoudong, the Secretary of the CCP Second District Committee, immediately telegraphed Liu Xiaojian, the Propaganda Minister of the County Committee; on the same day, I also went to the County Committee to report the situation. Minister Liu Xiaojian said very seriously: "You've come at the right time, I was just about to send someone to call you. It's not good that you criticized the village cadres in the newspaper, but what procedures did you go through to write the manuscript? (meaning it wasn't reviewed by him) The village's opera performance was approved by the county and district governments, it was legal, and it can't be said to be wasteful. You should examine yourself carefully!" Finally, he said in a very solemn tone: "In order to solve this problem, our opinion is to let you come to the office to find a quiet room and conduct a good ideological self-criticism." Afterwards, the Deputy Secretary of the Second District Committee said to me: "The district is also dissatisfied with you for writing a manuscript criticizing the village cadres. If they have shortcomings, you can raise them in person, why publish them in the newspaper? Isn't this打击打击 the cadres' emotions? What good is it for the work?" I repeatedly explained to them that such criticism represented the opinions of the broad masses, and asked them to investigate to see if it was true. He expressed his dissatisfaction and said: "In such a big village, it will take twenty days to figure it out."

    Due to the leadership's lack of a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism, and shielding the village cadres, it invisibly encouraged the mistakes of a few cadres in Leitou Village. Since the opera performance, on January 15th, the neighborhood cadre Zheng Fushi and other minority village cadres took it upon themselves, without asking the district government or obtaining the consent of the villagers, to privately demolish the eight rooms of the peasant association (which were not distributed after the land reform), and sold the wood for six million yuan, all of which was used to buy opera costumes. At present, there are still several poor households in Leitou Village who lack housing, which has caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. However, because the village cadres' style of work is undemocratic, no one dares to express their opinions.

    A few days ago, Han Huayi, the Secretary of the CCP Ji County County Committee, and Zhao Bi, the Magistrate of Ji County, returned from a meeting in the province, and I reported this situation to them. They both expressed their support for this criticism. However, I feel that the general village and district cadres of Ji County, especially some county-level cadres, still lack a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism, and further developing criticism and self-criticism is still a serious ideological struggle.

    I sent this letter after repeated ideological struggles. Since Minister Liu Xiaojian spoke with me, I feel like a big stone is weighing on my heart, and I have many concerns; now I am personally suffering from lung disease. But I am a Communist Party member, and I should adhere to principles, so I summoned all my courage to tell you.
                              Fan Weijun, Leitou Village, Second District, Ji County, Hebei Province

    Editor's Note: Comrade Fan Weijun's letter reflects the CCP Ji County County Committee Propaganda Minister Comrade Liu Xiaojian and certain district and village cadres' abuse of power to suppress criticism and implement attacks on critics, which is contrary to the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications."

    The Central Committee's decision clearly pointed out: "Carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications is a necessary method to consolidate the connection between the Party and the people, guarantee the democratization of the Party and the state, and accelerate social progress." But the Deputy Secretary of the CCP Second District Committee of Ji County believes that criticism in newspapers is to打击打击 the cadres' emotions and is not beneficial to the work. Obviously, this is completely wrong.

    In order to improve the people's awareness and enthusiasm and attract the people to actively participate in the cause of national construction, the people are completely free to publish their criticisms and suggestions to the Party and the People's Government in newspapers and publications. The Central Committee's decision stipulates: "Party leadership organs and cadres at all levels must adopt a warm welcome and resolute protection revolutionary attitude towards criticisms that reflect the opinions of the masses, and oppose the bureaucratic attitude of ignoring mass criticism, restricting publication, and implementing attacks, retaliation, and ridicule against critics." But certain county and district cadres in Ji County just don't value the correct opinions of the broad masses, and shield the erroneous behaviors of certain village cadres who have harmed the interests of the people, and attack critics. This is an intolerable mistake.

    In order to ensure that criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications can be carried out smoothly and effectively, the Central Committee stipulates: "All criticisms published in newspapers and publications are the independent responsibility of the reporters and editors of the newspapers and publications. ... Even if the consent of the criticized person has not been sought or obtained, they should still be responsible for publishing it." Minister Liu Xiaojian of the Ji County County Committee Propaganda Department criticized Comrade Fan Weijun for "not going through review," which is completely wrong.

    We believe that abusing power to suppress criticism and even attack critics is not an isolated phenomenon today. Therefore, it is recommended that Party committees at all levels in various places, in addition to vigorously implementing the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," should give necessary criticism and education and even disciplinary action to Party members who have violated or failed to implement the decision.

### 中共冀县县委宣传部长  无原则地打击批评者

专栏：读者来信

　　中共冀县县委宣传部长
    无原则地打击批评者编辑同志：
    一月二十四日人民日报《读者来信专页》发表了“冀县二区垒头村干部，强迫唱大戏、吃喝浪费”的批评信件以后，不仅垒头村村干部没有认真接受批评，检讨缺点，中共冀县县委会宣传部部长刘晓建对于这项批评也极表不满，他毫无原则地袒护垒头村干部损害群众利益的行为，并打击代表群众意见提出批评的人。
    那封信是我根据垒头村全体群众意见写的，所以村干部就对我实行报复。一天晚上，他们派了两个治安员到我家里，态度很强硬地说：“村公所叫你哩！”我问治安员“有什么事？”回答说：“你自己办的事还不知道吗？”当天晚上我因为有病没去（第二天才知道是为了登报的事）。第二天，在少数村干部操纵之下，全体村干部到二区区政府去请愿，以要求辞职来抗拒批评。中共二区区委书记胡守栋当即电告县委宣传部部长刘晓建；即日，我也到县委会报告情况。刘晓建部长很严肃地说：“你来的正好，我正要派人去叫你。你在报上批评村干部不好，可是你写稿经过了什么手续呢？（意思是没经他审阅）村里唱大戏是经过了县、区政府批准的，合法的，不能说是浪费。你好好检讨一下吧！”最后，他态度很严正地说：“为了解决这一问题，我们的意见是让你来机关找个安静屋子，很好地作个思想检讨。”事后，二区区委副书记对我说：“你写稿批评村干部，区里对你也不满。他们有缺点你可以当面提，何必在报上发表呢？这不是打击干部情绪吗？对工作有什么好处？”我反复地向他们说明这样的批评是代表了广大群众的意见，并且请他们去调查，看是否真实。他很不满意地表示：“这么大村子，二十天也弄不清楚。”
    由于领导上对批评与自我批评没有正确的认识，包庇村干部，致无形中助长了垒头村少数干部的错误。该村自唱大戏后，于一月十五日由小区干部郑福石和其他少数村干部做主，没请示区政府，也没征得本村群众同意，便私自将农会的八间房拆毁（土地改革后没分配的），将木料卖了六百万元，全部买了戏装。目前垒头村尚有若干贫户缺少房子住，因此，又引起群众很大不满。可是，因为村干部作风不民主，群众谁也不敢提意见。
    前几天，中共冀县县委书记韩化一和冀县县长赵壁由省开会回来，我把这个情况向他们作了报告，他们都表示支持这一批评。但是，我觉得冀县一般村、区干部，特别是县级某些干部，对于批评与自我批评还十分缺乏正确的认识，进一步开展批评与自我批评还是一个严重的思想斗争。
    我写这封信，是经过再三的思想斗争才发出的。自从刘晓建部长和我谈话后，我心里好像有块大石头放不下，顾虑很多；现在我个人正患着肺病。但我是一个共产党员，我应该坚持原则，因此我鼓了十二分的勇气来告诉你们。
                              河北省冀县第二区垒头村  樊维钧 
    编者按：樊维钧同志的来信，反映了中共冀县县委会宣传部部长刘晓建同志及某些区、村干部滥用职权压制批评、对批评者实行打击的恶劣作风，是违背中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”的精神的。
    中央决定中曾明确指出：“在报纸刊物上进行批评和自我批评，是为了巩固党与人民群众的联系、保障党和国家的民主化、加速社会进步的必要方法”。但中共冀县二区区委副书记却认为：在报纸上进行批评，是打击干部情绪，对工作没有好处。显然，这是完全错误的。
    为了提高人民群众的觉悟和积极性，吸引人民群众踊跃参加国家建设事业，人民群众是完全可以自由地在报纸刊物上发表他们对党和人民政府的批评和建议。中央决定规定：“党的各级领导机关和干部必须对于反映群众意见的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，而反对对群众批评置之不理、限制发表和对批评者实行打击、报复与嘲笑的官僚主义态度。”但冀县某些县、区干部恰恰不重视广大群众的正确意见，袒护损害了人民利益的某些村干部的错误行为，打击批评者。这是不能容忍的错误。
    为了保障在报纸刊物上的批评和自我批评得以顺利而有效地进行，中央规定：“凡在报纸刊物上公布的批评，都由报纸刊物的记者和编辑负独立的责任。……即令并未征求或并未征得被批评者的同意，仍然应当负责加以发表。”冀县县委宣传部刘晓建部长以“没有经过审查”来非难樊维钧同志，是完全错误的。
    我们认为：滥用职权，压制批评甚至打击批评者，在今天还不是一个个别现象。因此，建议各地各级党委会除应以大力贯彻中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”外，对已经违犯或不执行决定的党员，应给予必要的批评教育甚至纪律处分。
