Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily
    Regarding the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau's Abuse of Boiler Cleaning Bonuses
        Tianjin Railway Administration Locomotive Department's Self-Criticism

Editor Comrades:

    The February 10th issue of the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column published Comrade Lan Ying's criticism of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau's abuse of boiler cleaning bonuses. The Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau has already conducted a self-criticism, but we also bear responsibility for this matter. Our self-criticism is as follows:

    The boiler cleaning and inspection reward method is implemented by us according to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Railways. Before implementation, we considered that the standards for water scale thickness and area stipulated by the Ministry could not be precisely measured inside the locomotive boiler. If no clear inspection method was specified, there would be difficulties in specific implementation. Therefore, we reported to the Ministry of Railways four times and requested clear instructions, but we never received a response. However, we also failed to propose specific improvement measures and simply followed orders. We also failed to promptly inspect the deviations in on-site execution, such as the phenomenon of false reporting of results. These are all things for which we should conduct self-criticism. We have now requested further instructions from the Ministry of Railways. Before the inspection method is clearly defined, the bureau will temporarily suspend the implementation of this reward method starting from February.

            Jilin Chemical Factory No. 1's Self-Criticism Regarding Accumulated Funds

Editor Comrades:

    The January 17th issue of the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column published Comrade Peng Yiren's criticism of our accumulation of funds, which is basically correct. Our self-criticism is as follows:

    (1) Due to our inadequate planning during the construction of the factory and the lack of sound design drawings, only two-thirds of the construction project was completed, and the construction funds were exhausted. As a result, important parts such as the dewaxing field and water source equipment could not be built on time, which affected the production tasks and the failure to improve product quality.

    (2) Low technical level. From the beginning of our factory's construction to the present, the production of petroleum and shale oil has remained in the research stage. Due to the lack of technical certainty, the product was delayed for two months and failed to fulfill the order contract. After the order contract was overturned, the product was stockpiled. Insufficient technical conditions have also caused our factory to be unable to properly process some products now.

    (3) We have not provided enough political unity and assistance to technical personnel, so they have not been able to fully utilize existing technology. This is also something we must improve in the future.

    As for the bank's investment of more than 200 billion (Northeast currency, same below) to us, the actual accumulated working capital is only more than 80 billion. The rest all belongs to construction investment (fixed capital). Now, most of the products accumulated by our factory have been sold. The situation of accumulated funds has improved.

                                                    Jilin Chemical Factory No. 1
            Everyone Should Care About the Cause of National Construction

Editor Comrades:

    I also agree with the opinions of Wang Jinlin and others on the issue of Lin Jie's punishment in the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column on January 5th, believing that the Central People's Supervisory Committee's handling was inappropriate. But after I read "Letters from Readers on the Issue of Lin Jie's Punishment and the Process of Resolution" in the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" page on February 21st, I had a correct understanding of the handling of the Lin Jie case. This matter has given me a great inspiration: the opinions put forward by a few people can actually attract such attention from the Central People's Government's People's Supervisory Committee. The People's Government's style of being responsible to the people and respecting public opinion has greatly moved me. Every person should responsibly and actively put forward opinions on the cause of national construction to help the government do a good job. This is not only being responsible to oneself, but also to the people of the whole country.

    Finally, I hope that Comrade Lin Jie should recognize the People's Government's spirit of treating illnesses to save people, and wholeheartedly serve the people in the future, striving to make up for past mistakes and compensate for the losses caused to the people.

                                                Liu Yao, Siwangfu Village, Beijing

### 对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　对人民日报批评建议的反应
    关于张家口铁路分局滥发洗炉奖金问题
         天津铁路管理局机务处的检讨编辑同志：
    二月十日人民日报《读者来信》栏登载蓝英同志对张家口铁路分局滥发洗炉奖金的批评，张家口分局已作了检讨，但我们对这件事也应负责，兹检讨如下：
    锅炉洗检奖励办法，是我们按照铁道部公布的办法执行的。实行以前曾考虑到部定水锈厚度及面积的标准，无法在机车锅炉内进行精密的测量。如不明确规定检查方法，则具体执行时会有困难，故曾前后四次向铁道部反映，并请求明确指示，一直未获结果。但我们亦未能提出具体改善办法，只是按令行事。对于现场执行中的偏差，如虚报成绩现象，也未及时检查。这些都是我们应该检讨的。现在我们已再请示铁道部。在检查方法未明确规定前，本局自二月份起暂行停止实行该项奖励办法。
                                                天津铁路管理局机务处
            吉林化学工厂第一厂关于积压资金的检讨编辑同志：
    一月十七日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登彭亦人同志对我们积压资金的批评，基本上是正确的，现在检讨如下：
    （一）由于我们建厂时计划不周，缺乏健全的设计绘图，结果建厂工程才完三分之二，建筑资金就用完了，以致重要部分之脱腊场及水源设备等不能按时建设，影响了生产任务和产品质量不能提高。
    （二）技术水平低。我厂开始建设到现在，石油和页岩油的生产还停止在研究阶段。由于技术上没有把握，产品迟出了两个月，未能履行订货合同。在订货合同推翻后，产品就积压下来。技术条件的不够，又造成我厂现在部分产品不能得到适当处理。
    （三）我们对于技术人员在政治上的团结和帮助不够，以致他们未能充分发挥现有技术。这也是我们今后必须改进的。
    至于银行对我们投资虽有两千多亿（东北币，下同），但积压的流动资金实际只有八百余亿。其余全属于建设投资（固定资金）。现在我厂积压的产品，已大部售出。积压资金情况已有好转。
                                                    吉林省化工第一厂
            每个人都应关心国家建设事业编辑同志：
    人民日报一月五日《读者来信》栏内，所载王金林等对林洁处分问题的意见信，我看了也同意他们的意见，认为中央人民监察委员会处理不当。但在我看了二月二十一日人民日报《读者来信》专页所载“关于林洁处分问题的读者来信及解决经过”后，才对林洁案的处理有了正确的认识。从这件事又给我一个很大的启发：几个人提出的意见，居然能引起中央人民政府人民监察委员会这样的重视。人民政府这种对人民负责，尊重民意的作风，使我受到很大的感动。每一个人民都应该负责地积极地对国家建设事业提出意见，以帮助政府做好工作。这不但是向自己负责，也是向全国人民负责。
    最后，我希望林洁同志应该认识人民政府治病救人的精神，今后全心全意为人民服务，争取立功赎过，抵偿过去给人民造成的损失。
                                                北京四王府村  刘耀
