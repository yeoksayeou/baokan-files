Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 2nd:

　　The soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are warmly endorsing Marshal Stalin's remarks on the current international situation. The mimeographed newspapers containing the full text of Stalin's speech are being eagerly passed around and read by the soldiers at the front lines.

　　The soldiers attach particular importance to the parts of Stalin's speech concerning Korea and China. Mao Rongbin, a corporal in a unit of the Korean People's Army, said, "Stalin is right. Those who slander the Chinese people, who are defending the security of their own country, as 'aggressors' have completely lost their conscience!" The Volunteer Army soldiers who have personally witnessed the barbaric acts of the American aggressors in Korea are using their own observations to prove that American imperialism is the real aggressor. Wang Zhihe, a soldier in a certain unit, said, "Who is it that occupied our Taiwan and bombed our Northeast? Who is it that killed tens of thousands of Korean people and bombed Korean cities and villages? The evidence is irrefutable, and the truth is easily revealed!" Li Jixiang, a soldier, said, "If the American soldiers were to invade China, my family would be slaughtered by them just like the Korean people. Our determination is: resolutely eliminate the American aggressors in Korea, defend our motherland, defend our parents, and never allow imperialism to bring the flames of war to China!"

　　Marshal Stalin's wise predictions about the future of the Korean War, and his great appeal to the people of the world to stop new wars and defend peace, have greatly inspired the fighting will of the soldiers and strengthened their confidence in victory. Volunteer Army soldier Feng Maotang said, "We are fighting the American aggressors to defend our country and our homes, and also to defend world peace. The more enemies we eliminate, the more we contribute to world peace!" Guarantee letters and letters of determination from the soldiers, striving for greater victories, are being sent to commanders at all levels like snowflakes. They say: "Let American imperialism remember: if it does not believe that its aggressive schemes will fail, then we will show it!"

　　中朝人民部队指战员热烈拥护斯大林谈话
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战士们，热烈拥护斯大林大元帅关于目前国际形势的谈话。载有斯大林谈话全文的油印报纸，在前线上被战士们争相传阅着。
    战士们特别重视斯大林谈话中有关朝鲜和中国的部分。朝鲜人民军某部下士毛容宾说：“斯大林说得对，把保卫自己祖国安全的中国人民诬蔑为‘侵略者’的人，实在是丧尽了天良！”亲眼见到美国侵略者在朝鲜的野蛮行为的志愿军战士们，纷纷用自己的见闻来证明美帝国主义才是侵略者。某部战士王致和说：“究竟是谁侵占了我们台湾，轰炸了我们东北？是谁杀死了成千上万的朝鲜老百姓，轰炸朝鲜的城市村庄？人赃俱在，一揭就穿！”战士李吉祥说：“如果让美国兵打到中国，我家就也会像朝鲜人民一样被他们屠杀的。我们的决心是：坚决把美国侵略军消灭在朝鲜，保卫祖国，保卫爹娘，决不允许帝国主义把战火烧到中国去！”
    斯大林大元帅关于朝鲜战争前途的英明预见，和他对世界人民的制止新战争、保卫和平的伟大号召，大大鼓舞了战士们的战斗意志，增强了他们的胜利信心。志愿军战士冯茂堂说：“我们打击美国侵略者，是为了保家卫国，也是为了保卫世界和平。我们多消灭一个敌人，就是为世界和平多贡献了一分力量！”战士们争取更大胜利的保证书、决心书正在雪片似地送到各级指挥员的手里去，他们说：“让美帝国主义记着：如果他不相信他的侵略阴谋会失败，那我们就做给他看！”
