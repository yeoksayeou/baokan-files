The valiant artillerymen of the Chinese People's Volunteers

Special Correspondent of this newspaper, Li Wei

The Chinese People's Volunteers, with their determination to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard their homes and defend their country, with incomparable courage, marched south on foot, traveling by night and resting by day, crossing rivers, climbing mountains, and traversing forests. They did not complain about camping out, and they did not fall behind even on continuous marches. Under the encouragement of the slogan "To be able to walk is victory," the volunteer artillery units, carrying heavy equipment and bearing the hopes of the Chinese and Korean people, advanced forward.

The soldiers promoted a high degree of friendship and mutual assistance, guaranteeing the victory of the march. The experience of a group from the fourth squad of the ninth company of a certain artillery unit is an epitome of the entire artillery force. After marching eighty *li* on the first day, soldier Shen Zhenhua became tired. On the second day, Wu Chunhua and Cai Baiming from the same group took six or seven items from Shen Zhenhua, including his leather boots, single shoes, and food bag, reducing the weight he carried. After arriving at the campsite, Wu and Cai boiled water for Shen to wash his feet and relieve his fatigue; the two of them dug three air-raid shelters, even digging one for Shen. On the fifth day of the march, the weather was very cold. Wu Chunhua gave his leather hat and cotton gloves to Shen to wear—because Shen joined the unit later and had not yet received his leather hat and gloves—while he himself wore old ones. During the last two days of the forced march, Wu and Cai snatched Shen's luggage and put it on the ammunition truck accompanying the army, and Wu himself snatched the rifle that Shen was carrying and carried it himself. They completed the eight-day journey in this way and arrived at the battlefield to eliminate the enemy.

The volunteer soldiers are intelligent and good at learning. Under the slogans of "More sweat, less blood" and "Rather make redundant preparations than suffer one in ten thousand losses," they promoted the People's Army's extremely arduous and struggling work style. On the march and in the garrison, they cleverly built all kinds of air-raid shelters, making skillful use of the terrain, being good at camouflage and concealment, and paying attention to sturdiness and suitability, so as to preserve their own strength and use this strength to annihilate the enemy on the battlefield. During the Second Campaign, the artillerymen of a certain unit even built "heated-bed bunkers" on the positions. They also dug "stove bunkers" for the artillery horses to cook fodder, and dug shelters for the artillery, vehicles, and horses, truly achieving "not exposing a single horsehair." They cleverly built fortifications and arranged camouflage on the artillery positions, so that enemy aircraft could not detect them even in broad daylight. They chose positions on the large mountains seven hundred meters in front of the enemy's positions, and built winding mountain roads for moving artillery vehicles.

On New Year's Eve of 1950, when our army launched the New Year Offensive, our artillery on the mountainous area north of the Imjin River suddenly hurled thousands of shells at the enemy positions across the river within minutes, overturning the enemy's bunkers and fortifications, and covering the heroic infantry, which quickly broke through the enemy's defenses.

In previous battles, the People's Volunteer Army artillery had also displayed their power. On November 6th, when the U.S. and ROK forces in the Unsan and Wenjing area were annihilated and fled in a panic, the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division on the eastern front launched a fierce offensive westward in an attempt to save the precarious situation on the western front. A certain unit of our volunteers was tasked with holding the Huangcaoling position, blocking the enemy, and fought fiercely with the enemy's motorized units, heavy artillery, tanks, and aircraft for a whole day, thwarting the enemy's attack. A certain artillery unit participating in this battle fired continuously from dawn to 2:00 p.m. Over six thousand meters away were more than eighty vehicles, motorcycle gun carts, and more than forty tanks of the enemy, and in the air were more than a dozen American planes flying low to bomb and strafe. However, our volunteer artillery continued to fire shells, supporting the infantry. Comrade Situ Yinssen, the gunner of the third gun of the sixth company of the unit, and the number three gunner Jiang Quanlin, defended their position together (because the number six gunner was killed and the number one gunner was wounded, other gunners were dispersed and concealed to reduce casualties). They made a mutual agreement: "We are determined that as long as the gun is here, no matter which of us sacrifices, the remaining one must persist in firing and eliminate the enemy!" Later, Situ Yinssen realized his determination, undertaking the duties of all the gunners alone—aiming, loading shells, pulling the firing mechanism... enabling this gun to persist in firing until the final victory. During this battle, the fourth gun of the fifth company of the unit accurately hit the enemy's vehicles and tank group. Although the bombs dropped by enemy planes exploded six or seven meters in front of the position, the gunners were not alarmed. At that time, the number one gunner Yu Rushui's leather belt was blown off, but he calmly pulled the firing mechanism to fire. The number two gunner Zhong Rongqiang's finger was wounded and bleeding, but he still calmly aimed. This gun was therefore awarded the glorious title of "Huangcaoling Hero Gun."

On November 2nd and 3rd, the day after the end of the Unsan battle, U.S. imperialist aircraft, like crows attending a funeral, flew over Unsan in an attempt to find opportunities for revenge. The volunteer anti-aircraft artillery of a certain unit bravely launched a fierce battle against the enemy aircraft, shooting down two enemy F-84E jet fighters and damaging two others. Comrade Shen Fu, the young deputy platoon leader of the seventh company of the unit, not only fought with the soldiers in battle, but also bravely and resourcefully eliminated temporary malfunctions of two guns, enabling the battle to proceed smoothly. Comrade Huang Mingqiu, a telephone operator, had laid telephone lines three times across the water before the battle, and on November 3rd, he connected the wires three times in battle, ensuring that the telephone was unblocked. When the area near the ammunition depot on the position was hit by enemy aircraft and caught fire, he bravely picked up a shovel and helped the ammunition squad put out the fire with sand, ensuring the safety of the position and rescuing the ammunition.

The heroic deeds of the artillerymen, like those of the infantry, are endless.

On the afternoon of November 7th, four enemy planes strafed two vehicles of the ammunition team of a certain artillery unit. The ammunition boxes had begun to catch fire, and it was on the verge of causing an explosion of the entire ammunition truck. Wu Yunlou, the deputy political instructor of the team, and Wu Daochun, the probationary deputy political instructor, immediately rushed out of the air-raid shelter, braving great danger, and moved the burning ammunition boxes off the vehicle, extinguishing the fire on the boxes and the vehicle.

Comrade Zhang Chenggui, a soldier and Communist Party member of the eighth company of a certain artillery regiment, proposed the method of "using shells with fuses to hit tanks" in the war preparation movement, preparing to use a "instantaneous" fuse that detonates on contact, attaching it to the head of the shell, and holding the shell to blow up the tank. He was the first to join the tank demolition team. Later, this heroic determination formed a movement in the artillery of the unit.

Comrade Chang Enju, a combat hero of the first company of a certain unit, gave the three pairs of rubber-soled sneakers he had been awarded for meritorious service to comrades who lacked shoes during a continuous march. He insisted on not falling behind despite blisters on his feet, and ran around taking care of his comrades. During the Second Campaign, in order to meet the enemy and rush to the front, he often carried two iron picks, two iron shovels, a rifle, and a reel of wire on his body. He often said: "It is right for me to help everyone, and my credit comes from everyone's help." When Yuan Qingxiang, a comrade from the sixth squad, injured his leg, he carried him on his back for a long time. During the Third Campaign, their campsite was attacked by air. Chang Enju disregarded the danger, forgetting himself, bravely rushing out of the air-raid shelter, using sand to put out the fire on the artillery vehicle, and removing the shells and oil from the front vehicle, rescuing ten war horses and the canvas covers of the harnesses and artillery vehicles that were in danger. Under his influence, soldiers Zhao Nianxue, Xue Zixue, Qiu Haishui, Jia Wenxiang and others also participated in the rescue work fearlessly, reducing the losses from the air raid.

Li Sheng, the assistant driver of the No. 101 tractor of the first platoon of the seventh company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, followed the vehicle on the march on October 27th. After crossing five mountains, the car's oil pump broke down. Since it was impossible to repair it at the time, he climbed outside the car body and held the oil pump with his hand to deliver oil, persisting in marching one hundred and twenty *li*. The next day, he walked eighty *li* in the same way. Although Li Sheng's fingers were frozen and rubbed swollen during the two nights of arduous marching, he successfully sent the artillery to the position and participated in the Unsan battle. Comrade Luo Xianjue, the head of the motor vehicle driver squad of a certain unit responsible for transporting military grain, fell behind for three days due to repairing the vehicle. He finally repaired the broken vehicle in the snow and caught up with the team, arriving at the front line on the fourth night. Drivers Zhang Fude and Wang Wancai snatched parts when the enemy planes attacked and the vehicle was hit. When the enemy planes dived, they dodged; when the enemy planes ascended and left, they went to rescue. Comrade Kong Zhaohai, a driver of the second supply company of the unit, when he was driving a vehicle to transport explosives to the front for the second time, the battery broke down on the road. He cleverly parked the vehicle and concealed it, not eating anything for two days, only drinking some cold water, taking care of the vehicle. On the third day, when the new battery was delivered, he installed the battery and hurried to catch up. He has safely transported four trips of supplies, traveling back and forth on the roads of northern Korea.

On frozen and snowy roads, rollovers and artillery crashes often occurred near steep slopes, narrow roads, and bridges. Whenever the soldiers encountered such a situation, they rushed to lift the vehicle and push the artillery with manpower, sometimes even jumping into the icy river to save the artillery and the vehicle. Platoon Leader Liang of the second platoon of the seventh company of a certain unit had not slept well for two days in order to take care of the soldiers and the vehicles, horses, and artillery. When a vehicle overturned once, he took the lead in jumping into the icy water, leading the soldiers to rescue the vehicle. Examples like this are too numerous to mention.

The artillery of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the icy and snowy weather, in the continuous forced marches caused by the rapid advance south on the front line, under the threat of blind air raids by enemy aircraft, are not afraid of all dangers, overcome all the difficulties they encounter, closely following the ever-victorious infantry, using their accurate and fierce artillery fire to destroy enemy defensive works, shocking the enemy's souls, and completing the task of supporting the infantry.

Forward! Artillery of the Chinese People's Volunteers! Use artillery to retaliate with artillery! Bombard the enemy! Recover the blood debt! Eliminate the American imperialist aggressors! Avenge the Korean and Chinese people!

　　人民志愿军英勇的炮兵们
    本报特约记者  李伟
    中国人民志愿军战士们凭着自己抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，凭着无比的勇气，用双脚步行，夜行昼宿，渡过河川，翻过大山，穿过森林，向南进军。露营不叫苦，连续行军不掉队；在“能走路就是胜利”的口号鼓舞下，志愿炮兵部队携带着沉重的装备，也背负着中、朝人民的希望，向前挺进。
    战士们发扬了高度的友爱互助的精神，保证了进军的胜利。炮兵某部九连四班的一个小组的经历，便是整个炮兵部队的一个缩影。当第一天行军八十里之后，战士沈振华走累了。第二天，同组的吴春华和蔡白明把沈振华的大头皮鞋、单皮鞋、干粮袋等六、七件东西给分别带上，减轻他身上的携带品的重量。到宿营地后，吴、蔡二人烧好了洗脚水给沈端来洗脚解乏；两个人挖好三个防空洞，连沈的也代挖了。第五天行军，天气很冷，吴春华把自己的皮帽、棉手套交给沈戴上——因为沈到部队晚，尚未领下皮帽和手套——，自己戴旧的。在最后两天急行军时，吴、蔡二人把沈的行李抢过来放在随军弹药车上，吴自己又把沈所背的步枪抢过来背上。他们就这样走完了八天的路程，赶到了歼敌的战场。
    志愿军战士们是聪明并且善于学习的。他们在“多流汗，少流血”，“宁作多余准备，不受万一损失”的口号下，发扬了人民军队无比的艰苦奋斗的劳动作风。在行军路上，在驻地，巧妙地修筑了各色各样的防空掩体，是那样地会利用地形，善于伪装荫蔽，注意坚固适用，以便保存自己的有生力量，以便在战场上能使用这个力量歼灭敌人。某部炮手们于第二个战役中甚至在阵地上修筑了“火炕掩蔽部”。还给炮马挖了煮马料的“火灶掩蔽部”，又挖了炮、车和马的掩体，真正做到了“不露一根马毛”。他们在炮兵阵地上巧妙地修筑了掩体，布置了伪装，使敌机在白昼都不能发觉。他们在敌人阵地前面七百公尺的大山上选择阵地，且修筑了运动炮车的盘山大道。
    当一九五○年的除夕之夜，我军发起新年攻势的时候，在临津江北岸山地的我军炮兵，在数分钟之内，突然向对岸敌阵投射出成千发的炮弹，打翻了敌人的碉堡、工事，掩护着神勇步兵，迅速突破了敌人的防线。
    在这以前的几次战斗中，人民志愿军炮兵也发挥了他们的威力。十一月六日，当云山、温井一带的美李军被歼狼狈溃逃时，美国侵略军在东线的海军陆战队第一师向西猛犯，企图挽救西线危局。我志愿军某部担任扼守黄草岭阵地，阻击敌人，和敌人的摩托化部队、重炮、坦克、飞机激战竟日，粉碎了敌人的进攻。参加这一战斗的炮兵某部，从拂晓打到下午两点。六千公尺外是敌人八十多辆汽车和摩托炮车、四十多辆坦克，空中是十几架美机低飞轰炸和扫射。但我志愿军炮兵始终不停地发射炮弹，支援步兵。该部六连三炮的瞄准手司徒荫森同志，曾与三炮手姜全林两人坚守阵地（因为六炮手牺牲，一炮手负伤，其他炮手为减少伤亡进行疏散隐蔽），他们互相约定：“我们有决心，只要炮在，咱俩不论那个牺牲，剩一个人也要坚持发射，消灭敌人！”后来，司徒荫森实现了他的决心，独自一人担负所有炮手的职务——瞄准、装填炮弹、拉火……使这门炮坚持发射到最后胜利。该部五连第四炮在这次战斗中，准确地击中敌人汽车与坦克群。虽然敌机投下的炸弹在阵地前六、七公尺处爆炸，炮手们也不惊慌。当时，一炮手于入水的皮带被炸断，仍然沉着拉火发射。二炮手钟荣强手指被炸伤流血，仍然沉着瞄准。这门炮因此获得了“黄草岭英雄炮”的光荣称号。
    当云山战斗结束的次两日——十一月二日和三日，美帝侵朝飞机就像吊丧的乌鸦一样，飞临云山上空，企图找寻报复的机会。我某部志愿高射炮兵即勇敢地向敌机展开激烈的战斗，击落敌人Ｆ八四Ｅ喷气式驱逐机两架，击伤两架。该部七连的年青的副排长申富同志，不仅在战斗中和战士们在一起作战，且勇敢机智地排除了两门炮的临时故障，使战斗顺利进行。电话员黄命求同志，战前曾三次涉水架好电话线，十一月三日又在战斗中三次接好电线，保证了电话畅通。当阵地上弹药所附近被敌机扫中起火时，他勇敢地拿起铁锹，协助弹药班把火用砂土扑灭，保障了阵地的安全，抢救了弹药。
    炮兵部队战士们英勇的事迹，和步兵一样，是说不完的。
    十一月七日下午，敌机四架扫射了炮兵某部弹药队的两辆车，弹药木箱已开始起火，眼看就要造成整个弹药车的爆炸。该队的副政治指导员吴云楼和见习副政治指导员吴道春两人立即冲出防空壕，冒着极大的危险，将烧着的弹药箱搬下车来，扑灭了箱子上和车上的火。
    炮兵某团八连战士、共产党员张成贵同志在战前想办法运动中，提出“炮弹上信管打坦克”的办法，准备用一触即发的“瞬发”引信按在弹头上，抱着这炮弹去爆炸坦克。他首先参加了坦克爆破组。后来，这一英雄式的决心，在该部各炮形成了一种运动。
    某部一连的战斗英雄常恩举同志，在连续行军中曾把自己因立功受奖的三双胶底球鞋送给缺少鞋子穿的战友，自己脚板上磨了泡坚持不掉队，并且到处奔走照料同志们。第二次战役中，为了迎击敌人，赶路进军，他身上经常背着两把铁镐、两把铁锹、一支大枪、一拐子电线。他经常说：“我帮助大家是应该的，我的功劳是大家帮助下得来的。”六班袁青祥同志轧伤了腿，他把他背着走了很久。三次战役中，他们的宿营地遭受了空袭。常恩举不顾危险，忘我地、勇敢地冲出防空掩蔽部，用砂土扑灭炮车上的火，取出装在前车中的炮弹、油类，抢救出在危险中的十匹战马和马?、炮车盖布等。在他的影响下，战士赵年学、薛自学、邱海水、贾文祥等也奋不顾身地参加抢救工作，减少了空袭的损失。
    高射炮某部七连驾驶一排一○一号牵引车司机助手李盛同志，十月二十七日随车进军。翻过五个山头后，汽车油泵坏了，当时无法修理，他即爬在车体外边，用手抅住油泵送油，坚持行军一百二十里，第二天又这样走了八十里。两夜二百里的艰苦行军，虽然李盛的手指连冻带磨的肿了，但胜利地将炮送上阵地，参加了云山战斗。担任运送军粮的某部汽车司机班长罗先觉同志，曾因修车掉队三天，终于在雪地里修好了坏车，追上队伍，于第四夜赶到前线。司机张福德、王万才在敌机袭来车被击中的时候，抢拆零件。敌机俯冲下来，他们就躲开：敌机上升离开，他们就又去抢救。该部辎重二连的司机孔昭海同志，当第二次架车装运炸药往前方运送时，路上，电瓶坏了，他巧妙地停车隐蔽，两天没吃一点东西，只喝些凉水，照看着车辆。第三天新电瓶送来了，他才装好电瓶赶上前去。他已安全地输送四趟物资，来往在朝鲜北部的公路上。
    行走在封冻和积雪的公路上，时常在陡坡、隘路、桥梁附近发生翻车翻炮的事故。战士们一遇到这种情况，便争先恐后地去抬车，人力推炮，有时竟跳进冰冷的小河里去救炮救车。某部七连二排梁排长，为照护战士们和车、马、炮，已两天未很好睡觉了，当一次车翻了的时候，他首先带头跳进冰水里，领导着战士们把车救了出来。像这样的例子是多得不胜枚举的。
    人民志愿军的炮兵，在冰天雪地中，在前线迅速向南推进而造成的连续急行军中，在敌机盲目空袭的威胁下，不怕一切的危险，战胜所遇到的一切困难，紧随着常胜的步兵，以自己准确猛烈的炮火，摧毁敌人的防御工事，震慑着敌人的魂魄，完成着支援步兵的任务。
    前进啊！人民志愿军的炮兵！以炮还炮！轰击敌人！追还血债！消灭美帝国主义侵略军！为朝、中人民复仇！
