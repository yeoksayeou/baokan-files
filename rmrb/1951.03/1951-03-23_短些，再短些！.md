Shorter, Shorter!
　　Hu Qiaomu

Editor's Note: This is a short article written by Comrade Hu Qiaomu for the Yan'an Liberation Daily in 1947. He advocated that speech and writing should be concise, popular, and lively. This is still a goal we should strive for. We are now republishing it (the author has made some corrections to the text) and are willing to work together with authors and readers who love this newspaper.

　　Speaking concisely is not an easy task. When I recall the many things I have said and reread what I have written, the first thing that saddens me is that it is neither concise nor necessary. I am reminded of the old saying, "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality," which is indeed true. The Yan'an conference against Party clichés on February 8, 1942, was originally called the Compression Conference. Four and a half years have passed, and compression has not yet been successful. The words of Lu Xun quoted at that time, "After finishing writing, read it at least twice, and try to delete unnecessary words, sentences, and paragraphs without regret," are still our alarm bell.

　　Our speeches are shortened by the chairmen of meetings; our articles are shortened by the editors of the Liberation Daily. Therefore, I make a proposal to the Liberation Daily:

　　1. Four-fifths of the news should be around 500 words;

　　2. Four-fifths of the features and supplements should be around 1,000 words;

　　3. Four-fifths of research papers, etc., should be around 2,000 words.

　　There is no need to list the reasons. This is of great benefit to both readers and authors, and it is a great liberation. More than four-fifths of the authors originally liked to write short pieces, but now the territory is occupied by a few "big landlords." Just take the Liberation Daily's supplement as an example. It has a particularly large format and a particularly small number of articles compared to similar publications across the country. I have seen that many other Liberation Zone newspapers also follow this example. I think we should admit that the mass viewpoint is too weak, or admit that we still don't know how to write for newspapers. We have not clarified the difference between writing for tens of millions of people every day and writing for thousands or tens of thousands of people every week or month, and we have not remembered that the longer the writing, the fewer people will read it. The "Free Talk" section of the Shenbao edited by Li Liewen may not be a good supplement for the masses, but it still published more than twice as many things in half the space of ours, most of which (including Lu Xun's great short essays) were only a few hundred words long, but were more popular, more lively, and richer than what we said. Let us have such a supplement: it does not have too many unnecessary discussions by intellectuals in various names, as Lenin called them; but every day, tens of thousands of words of space are filled with dozens of articles and letters from various authors and readers with various contents and forms, conveying various aspects of life and struggle in a practical and compact manner, conveying the voices of the masses, like a thriving garden.

### 短些，再短些！

　　短些，再短些！
    胡乔木
    编者按：这是胡乔木同志在一九四七年给延安解放日报写的一篇短文。他提倡说话作文都应该简要、通俗、活泼。这在目前仍然是我们应该努力的目标。我们现在重新发表它（其中的文字作者曾作了些改正），愿与热爱本报的作者和读者共同努力。
    话说得短说得简要，不是一件易事。我回想自己说过的许多话，重看写过的什么文章，先叫我难过的就是既不简又不要，想起“由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难”这老格言果然不错。一九四二年二月八日延安反对党八股的大会，原先就叫压缩大会。四年半了，压缩尚未成功。那次引的鲁迅的话，“写完后至少看两遍，竭力将可有可无的字、句、段删去，毫不可惜”，依然是我们的警钟。
    我们的说话短，靠开会的主席；作文短，靠解放日报的编辑。因此我向解放日报提个议：
    一、新闻要五分之四是五百字左右的；
    二、通讯和副刊稿件五分之四是一千字左右的；
    三、研究性的论文等等五分之四是两千字左右的。
    道理无须列举，这对读者作者都大有好处，都是大解放。五分之四以上的作者，原也是爱写短的，现在地盘叫少数“大地主”霸占着罢了。就说说解放日报的副刊罢，它在全国的同类中篇幅特大而篇数特少，我看过的其他解放区大报纸也多学这个样。我想我们应该承认群众观点太弱，或者承认我们还不会给报纸写作。没有弄清每天写给几十几百万人跟每周每月写给几千几万人的分别，没记着写得愈长看的人愈少。黎烈文编的申报自由谈，未必是给大众看的好副刊，但还是以我们一半的篇幅登了双倍多的东西，其中大部分（包括鲁迅那些伟大的小论文）不过几百字长短，却比我们所说的更通俗更活泼更丰富。让我们有这样的副刊罢：它没有太多的可有可无的以各种名义出现的列宁所谓知识分子的议论；可是每天万把字的版面挤满各种作者读者的跟各种内容形式的几十篇稿件信件，切实紧凑地传达着生活和战斗的各个侧面，传达着群众的呼声，好比生意旺盛的花园一般。
