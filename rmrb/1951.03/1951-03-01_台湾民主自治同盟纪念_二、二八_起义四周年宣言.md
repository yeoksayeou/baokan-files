After Japan surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the help of U.S. imperialism, took over Taiwan and carried out cruel oppression and exploitation of the Taiwanese people, causing strong hatred among them. Four years ago today, the Taiwanese people launched an armed struggle against the U.S. imperialist stooge, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, inflicting great blows on the enemy and demonstrating the patriotic spirit of the Taiwanese people. This was the "February 28th" Uprising.

For the past four years, U.S. imperialism and its stooge, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, have not abandoned their policy of poisoning Taiwan and antagonizing the Chinese people. Moreover, in addition to intensifying their instructions and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in occupying Taiwan, massacring the Taiwanese people, and hindering the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, U.S. imperialism, while launching the Korean War of aggression, openly sent armed forces to invade Taiwan. They are also stepping up their aggression against Vietnam and the Philippines, and plotting to rearm Japan, determined to be enemies of the Chinese people.

The Taiwanese people, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist armed invasion of China's territory, Taiwan. For the past four years, the people of the whole country have repeatedly expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan and have been preparing for the liberation of Taiwan. The Taiwanese people have also persisted in their relentless struggle against the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries under difficult conditions. The Taiwanese people fought stubbornly for half a century against the aggression of Japanese imperialism. Now, seeing the glorious victory of the great motherland and receiving strong encouragement from the people of the whole country, the Taiwanese people will surely fight with a hundredfold courage and strength, coordinate with the people of the whole country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, oppose the U.S. imperialist armed aggression, and will certainly be able to finally and victoriously liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors.

The Taiwanese people, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea. Taiwan and Korea have both suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialism and have jointly carried out anti-Japanese struggles. The Taiwanese people have learned a lesson from history: they must do their utmost to support the struggle of the Korean people in order to defeat the common enemy. The Taiwanese people feel infinitely excited about the victory of our Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea. The Taiwanese people, together with the people of the whole country, are determined to support the struggle of the Korean people in every possible way.

The Taiwanese people, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. For several years, U.S. imperialism has been instructing its stooge, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to collude with Japanese war criminals. For example, Hasegawa Kiyoshi, the former Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, and Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the former President of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Corporation, have long sneaked into Taiwan to help the U.S.-Chiang clique massacre the Taiwanese people and oppose the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. U.S. imperialism has long been restoring the remnants of Japanese militarism by various means, and has also been feeding Japanese financial groups with Taiwan's resources and the fruits of the Taiwanese people's labor through the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Japanese people have a deep friendship with the Chinese people, but Japanese imperialism has always been the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, especially the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people have suffered bloody massacres and dark rule under Japanese imperialism for half a century, and the Taiwanese people have fought a life-and-death struggle with Japanese imperialism for half a century with countless lives and blood. Today, U.S. imperialism is using Japan as a base to launch armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and is even attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan as a base and accomplice for expanding aggression. The Taiwanese people must not sit idly by and allow this U.S. imperialist conspiracy to succeed. We demand that the just and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, which is indispensable for guaranteeing peace in the East, be realized in accordance with international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation.

The series of brilliant victories of our motherland in the military, political, economic, and diplomatic fields, and the great victory of our glorious People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, prove that the Chinese people have the strength to overcome all difficulties. We have the determination and strength to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialist aggression and liberate our territory, Taiwan, from the hands of the American aggressors. Premier Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out in his speech celebrating National Day last year: "In the battle to liberate Taiwan, our strategic position is far superior to that of any enemy; we are standing on the side of sacred justice; our rear is so close, so large, and so solid; we are redoubling our efforts to achieve this final victory." The Chinese people have the determination to liberate Taiwan, and they will surely be able to defeat all enemies, liberate our territory Taiwan, and thus smash the entire aggressive plan of U.S. imperialism to invade Taiwan and use it as a base for invading the Chinese mainland and Asia.

Compatriots across the country and compatriots in Taiwan: Unite more closely, prepare more actively, and struggle more resolutely! In order to oppose U.S. imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan, in order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, in order to liberate our territory—Taiwan, in order to liberate our great People's Republic, in order to defend the victorious fruits of our great people, and in order to defend world peace, let us fight to the end!

　　台湾民主自治同盟纪念“二、二八”起义四周年宣言
    日本投降以后，蒋介石匪帮在美帝国主义帮助之下，接收了台湾，对台湾人民进行了残酷的压迫和剥削，引起了台湾人民强烈的仇恨。在四年前的今天，台湾人民发动了反对美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪帮的武装斗争，给敌人以很大的打击，表现了台湾人民的爱国主义精神。这就是“二、二八”的起义。
    四年来，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮并没有放弃他们荼毒台湾、与中国人民为敌的政策；而且，美帝国主义除加紧指使和帮助蒋介石匪帮盘踞台湾、屠杀台湾人民、阻碍中国人民解放台湾之外，与发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，更公然派遣武装部队侵略台湾；并加紧侵略越南、菲律宾，阴谋重新武装日本，决心与中国人民为敌。
    台湾人民和全国人民一起，坚决反对美帝国主义武装侵略中国领土台湾。四年来，全国人民一再表示解放台湾的决心，一直进行解放台湾的准备；台湾人民也坚持不懈地在艰苦条件下与美蒋反动派进行斗争。台湾人民为了反对日本帝国主义的侵略，曾经顽强地斗争了半个世纪；现在，台湾人民看到了伟大祖国的光辉胜利，得到了全国人民的有力鼓舞，必然会以百倍的勇气和力量进行斗争，配合全国人民和中国人民解放军，反对美帝国主义的武装侵略，并一定能够从美国侵略者手中最后胜利地解放台湾。
    台湾人民和全国人民一起，坚决反对美国帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略战争。台湾和朝鲜曾同受过日本帝国主义的侵略，并曾一致进行反日斗争。台湾人民从历史上取得教训：必须尽最大力量来支援朝鲜人民的斗争，才能打败共同的敌人。台湾人民对于我国人民志愿军在朝鲜的胜利，感到无限的兴奋；台湾人民和全国人民一起，决以一切可能的方式来支援朝鲜人民的斗争。
    台湾人民和全国人民一起，坚决反对美帝国主义对日片面媾和、重新武装日本的阴谋。数年以来，美帝国主义就曾指使其走狗蒋介石匪帮与日本战争罪犯相勾结。如前日本台湾总督长谷川清与前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介等，早就潜来台湾，帮助美蒋屠杀台湾人民、反对中国人民解放台湾。美帝国主义早就以各种方法恢复日本军国主义残余势力，又通过蒋介石匪帮以台湾的资源和台湾人民劳动的果实来喂养日本财阀。日本人民是与中国人民有深厚友谊的，但日本帝国主义从来就是中国人民特别是台湾人民死敌。台湾人民曾在半个世纪中受过日本帝国主义的血腥屠杀和黑暗统治，台湾人民曾在半个世纪中以无数的生命鲜血与日本帝国主义作过你死我活的斗争。今天，美帝国主义又正以日本为基地武装侵略台湾、朝鲜，更企图单独对日媾和、重新武装日本，作为扩大侵略的根据地和帮凶者。台湾人民决不能坐视美帝国主义这种阴谋得逞。我们要求按照开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告等国际协定，实现为保障东方和平所不可缺的、公正的全面的对日和约。
    我们祖国在军事上、政治上、经济上、外交上一连串的辉煌胜利，我们光荣的人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上的巨大胜利，都证明中国人民具有战胜一切困难的力量。我们有决心有力量彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略，从美国侵略者手中解放我们的领土台湾。周恩来总理在去年庆祝国庆日的讲演中已经明白指出：“在解放台湾的作战中，我们的战略地位是比任何敌人要优越得多；我们是站在神圣的正义方面；我们的后方是这样近，这样大，这样巩固；我们正为取得这个最后胜利而在加倍努力。”中国人民具有解放台湾的决心，并且一定能够击败一切敌人，解放我们的领土台湾，从而粉碎美国帝国主义侵略台湾、并据之作为侵略中国大陆与亚洲的基地的全部侵略计划。
    全国同胞和台湾同胞们：更紧密地团结起来，更积极地进行准备，更坚决地进行斗争！为了反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和、重新武装日本，为了抗美援朝，为了解放我们的领土——台湾，为了我们伟大的人民共和国的解放事业，为了保卫我们伟大人民的胜利果实，为了保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
