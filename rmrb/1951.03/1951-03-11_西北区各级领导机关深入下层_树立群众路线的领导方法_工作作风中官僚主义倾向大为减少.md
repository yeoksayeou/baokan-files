The leading organs at all levels in the Northwest Region, after the rectification campaign, adopted a leadership method of going deep into the grassroots, conducting investigations and research, and strengthening mass work. This has greatly reduced the bureaucratic tendencies in their work style.

Last October, when the rectification campaign in the Northwest Region concluded, the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the problems exposed during the campaign, emphasized that going deep into reality, conducting investigations and research, and vigorously launching mass movements are the fundamental keys to overcoming bureaucracy and commandism. Under this ideological guidance, most leading organs, after resolving some prominent issues in their current work, dispatched cadres in rotation, led by principal cadres, to go deep into the grassroots purposefully. They helped with work, mobilized the masses, grasped the situation, summarized experience, and cultivated cadres, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of the leading organs and further strengthening the connection between the Communist Party's organizations, the People's Government, and the broad masses.

This significant shift in the leadership style in the Northwest Region began with some leading organs at the Northwest Region level and gradually spread to the provinces under their jurisdiction. While resolving some prominent issues raised during the rectification campaign, the leading organs at the Northwest Region level proposed the issue of going deep into the grassroots, understanding the situation, and connecting with reality. After seriously criticizing the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry for its sloppy dereliction of duty in the purchase and storage of cotton seeds last spring, which resulted in serious losses in some cotton fields, the department used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism at the Northwest Agricultural Technology Conference. It first laid the ideological foundation for agricultural technology cadres in various places to combine technology with the masses. Subsequently, it convened a symposium on high-yield cotton planting with more than a hundred farmer cotton-planting experts at the Jingyang Farm in Shaanxi, enabling the technical cadres of the department to absorb the farmers' rich cotton-planting experience and begin to establish connections with people with cotton-planting skills among the farmers. Then, the department sent people to Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces to inspect the use of agricultural loans in 1950 and organized department cadres to participate in the agricultural production conferences in various provinces in the Northwest Region to further understand the agricultural production situation in various places. It was discovered that the agricultural loans were issued too late last year, affecting spring plowing; therefore, the agricultural loans for the first quarter of this year were issued as early as last December. After June of last year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Northwest Military and Political Committee organized 69 percent of the department's cadres to go deep into the grassroots, led by leading cadres, to assist provinces and counties in carrying out democratic political construction, demobilization, and preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and working cadres. When the work group led by Wu Zhiyuan, deputy minister of the department, went to Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu to inspect work, they first understood the general situation in the prefecture and county-level organs, and then went down to the district and township to directly participate in specific work. They based themselves among grassroots cadres and the masses, understood the leadership's thinking and leadership style, and then returned to the prefecture's leading organs to conduct key inspections. This method of combining top-down inspection and helping with work greatly helped the grassroots cadres, so that much work could be completed smoothly.

The leading organs at all levels in the Northwest Region universally transferred cadres to participate in the land reform and rent reduction movements carried out in the region last autumn and winter. The leading organs at the Northwest Region level transferred more than 130 cadres to the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province to participate in land reform in December of last year. Shaanxi Province transferred more than 10,000 cadres from provincial and sub-regional organs to participate in land reform, including members of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, ministers, and directors of the provincial People's Government. They conducted key investigations and research in the countryside, analyzed the development of the movement, summarized experience in a timely manner, guided work, and educated cadres; and paid special attention to cultivating leadership cadres and activists in the new rural areas during the movement. The provincial-level leading organs in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces also transferred more than a thousand cadres, formed work groups, and led by responsible cadres, went to various counties to assist in rent reduction and grain collection work.

In order to popularize this leadership work method, the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to use more effort to do mass work this year, and to use this as a regular leadership method to continue to overcome the bad bureaucratic work style existing among working cadres.

### 西北区各级领导机关深入下层  树立群众路线的领导方法  工作作风中官僚主义倾向大为减少

　　西北区各级领导机关深入下层
    树立群众路线的领导方法
    工作作风中官僚主义倾向大为减少
    西北区各级领导机关在整风运动后，采取了深入下层，进行调查研究，加强群众工作的领导方法，已经大大地减少了工作作风中的官僚主义倾向。
    去年十月，西北区整风运动结束时，中共中央西北局根据运动中所暴露出来的问题，着重指出：深入实际，调查研究，大力开展群众运动，是克服官僚主义和命令主义的基本关键。在这个思想指导下，多数领导机关在解决了当前工作中若干突出问题后，即纷纷轮流调派干部，在主要干部率领下，有目的地深入下层，通过帮助工作的方式发动群众，掌握情况，总结经验，培养干部，从而大大地提高了领导机关的办事效率，更加密切了共产党的组织、人民政府与广大群众的联系。
    西北区领导作风上这一巨大的转变，是由西北区一级若干领导机关开始，并逐渐推及所属各省的。西北区一级领导机关在解决整风中提出的若干突出的问题同时即提出了深入下层，了解情况，联系实际的问题。西北军政委员会农林部在整风中严肃批判了去春因收购与保管棉籽草率失责，致使若干棉田遭受严重损失的事故后，该部即通过西北农业技术会议，运用批评与自我批评的武器，首先使各地农业技术干部奠定了技术与群众相结合的思想基础；继在陕西泾阳农场召集农民植棉能手百余人，举行植棉丰产座谈会，使机关技术干部吸取农民丰富的植棉经验，并开始与农民中有植棉技术的人取得联系。接着该部又派人赴陕西、甘肃、青海等省，检查一九五○年农业贷款的使用，并组织机关干部分别参加西北各省农业生产会议，进一步了解了各地的农业生产情况，发现去年农业贷款发放太迟，影响春耕；因此，今年第一季度的农业贷款已提前于去年十二月发出。西北军政委员会民政部于去年六月以后，曾组织了占该部百分之六十九的干部深入下层，由领导干部率领，协助各省、县进行民主建政、复员和优待烈士家属、军人家属和工作干部家属的工作。该部副部长吴志渊所率领的工作组到甘肃平凉专区检查工作时，首先在专区与县级机关了解一般情况，然后下到区、乡直接参加具体工作，立足于基层干部和群众中，了解领导思想与领导作风，再回到专区领导机关进行重点检查。这种上下结合检查工作和帮助工作的方法，对下层干部的帮助极大，因而许多工作得以顺利完成。
    西北区各级领导机关都普遍抽调干部，参加去年秋冬两季在该区进行的土地改革和减租运动。西北区一级领导机关已于去年十二月先后抽调干部一百三十余人，到陕西省关中地区参加土地改革。陕西省从省级和分区级的机关中抽调干部万余人参加土地改革，其中有中共陕西省委委员、部长以及省人民政府厅长等。他们到农村中有重点地进行调查研究，分析运动发展的情况，及时总结经验，指导工作，教育干部；并特别注意在运动中培养新区农村中的领导干部和积极分子等问题。甘肃、青海及宁夏等省的省级领导机关中亦抽调干部千余人，组成工作组，由负责干部率领，分赴各县协助进行减租和征粮工作。
    中共中央西北局为了普及这一领导工作方法，决定今年要用更多的力量去做群众工作，并以此作为经常的领导方法，继续克服工作干部中存在的官僚主义不良作风。
