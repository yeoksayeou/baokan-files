The First Session of the World Peace Council made extremely important contributions to the cause of defending world peace. Its ten resolutions clearly pointed out the main goals and directions of the current struggle to defend peace, and therefore these resolutions have become a new program of action for the world's peace-loving people to further strive for lasting world peace and to shatter the imperialist plots to launch a new war. Among these great resolutions, the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact is particularly important. This declaration calls for the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to conclude a peace pact to ensure world peace and security. In today's fierce struggle between peace and the crisis of war, this declaration of the World Peace Council is undoubtedly a great appeal that deeply resonates with the people, and therefore it will surely win the unanimous support and enthusiastic support of the world's peace-loving people.

The peaceful cooperation of the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, is the decisive link in maintaining and consolidating world peace. This is an important principle for consolidating post-war world peace that peace-loving people of all countries sought from the mistakes of human history during and after World War II. This principle also became one of the important foundations of the United Nations organization, which was initially entrusted by the people of the world with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, and was embodied in the United Nations Charter as the voting principle of unanimous agreement of the five permanent members of the Security Council. This is because these five major powers actually possess the main means and actual power to ensure world peace and security, so they should shoulder the main responsibility for maintaining world peace. If one or some of these five major powers go the other way and are determined to carry out aggression and destroy peace, the result will inevitably be another world war. Therefore, peaceful cooperation between the five major powers is extremely important for the future of world peace. The current world situation is precisely because three of these five major powers, especially the United States, are following the path of launching wars and plundering the people of the world, which has caused the crisis of a new war. This is why the world's peace-loving people must take the conclusion of a peace pact as the most urgent and important task in the current struggle to defend peace. This struggle will force the bellicose imperialist countries, mainly the United States, to express their willingness for peace and to bring the world back from the crisis of war to the normal track of peace.

Among the world's five major powers, China and the Soviet Union have always advocated peace and fully agree to sign a five-power peace pact to jointly ensure world peace. "Upholding lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and opposing the imperialist policy of aggression and war" is one of the fundamental principles of the People's Republic of China's foreign policy and is clearly stipulated in Article 54 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council, firmly stated on behalf of the Chinese people at the meeting of the Peace Council: "We fully agree with and support the proposal to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers—the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France." "We believe that the sincere cooperation of these five countries will truly eliminate the danger of another war and will ensure universal peace and security." The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, signed by China and the Soviet Union as early as February 14, 1950, is the best proof that the people of the two countries are willing to jointly guarantee world peace with the people of other peace-loving countries. The purpose of signing the treaty, as declared in the preamble of the treaty, is to "consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world." Article 1 of the treaty stipulates: Both parties "are willing, in a spirit of faithful cooperation, to participate in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security, and to fully contribute their strength to the rapid realization of this goal." The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union and their struggle to safeguard world peace and prevent the United States from expanding its aggression in Asia have already had a great practical impact, and it has effectively prevented the outbreak of another world war. The Soviet Union proposed the suggestion of concluding a pact on the strengthening of peace between the five powers, twice in the General Assembly of the United Nations in September of 1949 and September of 1950. However, this suggestion, which was universally supported by all peace-loving people, was actually opposed by the US and British imperialist blocs, they manipulated the "voting machine" in the United Nations, and stubbornly rejected this peaceful suggestion time and again. However, this exposed the aggressive intentions of the US and British blocs nakedly in front of the world's peace-loving people.

The brilliant achievements of peaceful construction and the continuous improvement of people's lives in China and the Soviet Union are inseparable from the firm peace policies of China and the Soviet Union. In contrast, the heavy war burdens of the people of the United States, Britain, and France are inseparable from the aggressive policies of their reactionary governments to expand armaments and prepare for war. At the same time as the People's Republic of China overcame the disaster of inflation that had plagued it for twelve years and achieved a balance of state revenue and expenditure and the unification of the financial economy, the United States, Britain, and France are increasingly embarking on the dangerous road of inflation; at the same time as the Soviet Union reduced prices for the fourth time in the five years after the war, greatly increasing the actual income of the people, the United States, Britain, and France have heavily increased the burden on the people with huge military budgets. From the military budgets of the Truman government of the United States, the Attlee government of the United Kingdom, and the Pleven government of France, it is not difficult to see how they are stepping up preparations for aggressive wars. The direct military expenditure in the Truman government's budget for 1951-1952 reached 41.421 billion US dollars, an increase of nearly doubled compared with the 20.99 billion US dollars in the previous year. In fact, the Truman government's military expenditure for 1950-1951, including direct military expenditure, foreign aid appropriations, atomic energy expenditure, and additional military appropriations after the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, totaled 41 billion US dollars, which was nearly doubled more than the originally planned direct military expenditure (20.99 billion US dollars). The military expenditure for 1951-1952, including direct military expenditure of 41.421 billion US dollars, reached 58.005 billion US dollars in Truman's budget, accounting for more than 80% of the total budget for the year. The Attlee government of the United Kingdom proposed a plan to expand armaments and prepare for war on January 29 this year, increasing the originally planned military expenditure for the next three years from 3.6 billion pounds to 4.7 billion pounds, which is an average of 1.57 billion pounds per year, also doubling compared with the military budget of 780 million pounds in 1950. France's military budget for 1951, which is called an unprecedentedly huge military budget in history, amounted to 1.25 trillion francs, more than doubling the 500 billion francs in 1950. Do these facts not most clearly show who is frantically preparing for war? In the actual pace of implementing aggression and expanding war, these three imperialist countries, especially the United States, have increasingly stepped up. After suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, the United States has intensified its efforts to actively rearm Japan in Asia, actively arm West Germany in Europe, and manipulated the United Nations to pass a shameful decision that slanderously labeled our country as an "aggressor" in an attempt to create an excuse for expanding the war of aggression. This has made the danger of a new war more and more serious.

However, war is not inevitable. The key here is the struggle of the world's peace-loving people. We should, under the call of the World Peace Council to conclude a peace pact, widely and actively carry out activities and strive for the early conclusion of a peace pact. The world's peace-loving people, especially the people of the United States, Britain, and France, must unite all possible forces and force the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to express their attitude towards peace in the face of this great declaration of the World Peace Council. This is a serious struggle, and it is also a targeted blow to the plots of the reactionary governments of the United States, Britain, and France, especially the US government, to launch a new war.

In the struggle to strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, we must expose all the sabotage plots of imperialism at any time. As Marshal Stalin pointed out in his conversation with the American politician Stassen, on the road to international peace cooperation, "the possibility of cooperation always exists, but the willingness to cooperate does not always exist." If the reactionary governments of the United States, Britain, and France brazenly reject the peaceful demands of the world's peace-loving people, then they will finally expose their aggressive determination to launch a new war. The result will inevitably be that war-mongers like Truman, Attlee, and Pleven will be completely isolated among the people. Then, the war-mongers will be closer to their own failure.

### 争取早日缔结和平公约

　　争取早日缔结和平公约
    世界和平理事会第一届会议对世界保卫和平事业做出了极重要的贡献。它的十项决议明确地指出了当前保卫和平斗争的主要目标和方向，因而这些决议也就成为世界爱好和平人民进一步争取世界持久和平、粉碎帝国主义发动新战争阴谋的新的行动纲领。在这些伟大的决议中，尤其重要的是关于缔结和平公约的宣言。这个宣言，要求中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国及法国，缔结和平公约，以保障世界和平与安全。在和平与战争危机激烈斗争的今天，世界和平理事会的这个宣言，无疑是深入人心的伟大号召，因而它必将获得世界爱好和平人民的一致拥护与热烈支持。
    中、苏、美、英、法五大国的和平合作，是维护与巩固世界和平的决定环节。这是第二次大战期间及大战以后，各国爱好和平人民在人类历史的错误中所寻求出来的巩固战后世界和平的重要原则。这个原则也就成为当初全世界人民赋予以维护国际和平与安全为职责的联合国组织的重要基础之一，并在联合国宪章中，体现为安全理事会中五个常任理事国一致协议的表决原则。这是因为这五个大国实际掌握着保证世界和平与安全的主要手段与实际的力量，所以它们应当担当起维护世界和平的主要责任。假如这五大国之中的某一国家或其中的一些国家，反其道而行，决心实行侵略、破坏和平，其结果就一定要引起再一次的世界大战。因此，五大国之间的和平合作，对于世界和平的前途是异常重要的。目前的世界形势，正因为这五大国中有三个帝国主义国家，首先是美国，遵循着发动战争、掠夺世界人民的道路，才引起了新战争的危机。这就是为什么世界爱好和平人民必须以缔结和平公约，作为当前保卫和平斗争的最迫切和最重要的任务的理由。这个斗争将迫使好战的帝国主义国家，主要是美国，表示它的和平意愿，来把世界从战争的危机中挽回到和平的正常轨道上去。
    在世界五大国中，中苏两国一贯主张和平；完全赞成签订五大国和平公约，来共同保障世界和平。“拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策”，是中华人民共和国外交政策的根本方针之一，并明确地规定在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的第五十四条中。我国出席世界和平理事会代表团团长郭沫若，在和平理事会会议上代表中国人民坚决表示：“我们完全同意并支持订立五大国——中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国、法国——和平公约的建议。”“我们相信，这五国的真诚合作将真正消除另一次战争的危险，并将保证普遍的和平与安全。”中苏两国早在一九五○年二月十四日所缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约，更是两国人民愿与其他爱好和平国家的人民共同保障世界和平的最好的证明。条约签订的目的，如条约序文所宣布的，就是为了要“巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全”。条约的第一条规定：双方“愿以忠诚的合作精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之迅速实现充分贡献其力量”。中苏两大国的这个伟大同盟及其对于维护世界和平、制止美国在亚洲扩大侵略所进行的斗争，已经发生了伟大的实际影响，它有力地防止着另一次大战的爆发。苏联曾在一九四九年九月和一九五○年九月，两次在联合国大会上提出五大国间缔结关于加强和平公约的建议。但是，为一切爱好和平人民所普遍支持的这个建议，竟是美英帝国主义集团所敌视的，它们操纵了联合国中的“表决机器”，一再蛮横地拒绝了这个和平建议。但是，这却使美英集团的侵略意图在世界爱好和平人民的面前赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    中苏两国和平建设的辉煌成就和人民生活的不断提高，是与中苏两国坚定的和平政策分不开的。与此相反，美、英、法三国人民的沉重的战争负担，则是与它们的反动政府扩军备战的侵略政策分不开的。在中华人民共和国战胜了为害十二年的通货膨胀灾祸，并取得了国家收支平衡、财政经济统一的同时，美、英、法三国却日益走上了通货膨胀的危险的道路；在苏联战后五年来第四次减低物价，使人民的实际收入大大提高的同时，美、英、法三国却以庞大的军事预算，沉重地增加了人民的负担。从美国杜鲁门政府、英国艾德礼政府、法国普利文政府的军事预算上，不难看出它们是怎样地在加紧着侵略战争的准备。杜鲁门政府一九五一——一九五二年度预算中的直接军事费用，即达四百十四亿二千一百万美元，比前一个年度的二百零九亿九千万美元，增加了将近一倍。事实上，杜鲁门政府一九五○——一九五一年的军事费用，包括直接军费、援外拨款、原子能经费及侵朝战争发生后的额外军事拨款在内，共达四百十亿元，比原来预定的直接军事费用（二百零九亿九千万美元）多了将近一倍。而一九五一——一九五二年度的军事费用，包括直接军费四百十四亿二千一百万美元在内，在杜鲁门的预算中即达五百八十亿零五千万美元，占全年总预算的百分之八十以上。英国的艾德礼政府在今年一月二十九日所提出的扩军备战计划，将原来预定今后三年的军事费用，由三十六亿英镑增加至四十七亿英镑，即平均每年为十五亿七千万英镑，比一九五○年的军费预算七亿八千万镑也增加了一倍。法国一九五一年的军事预算，是被称为历史上空前庞大的军事预算的，数达一万二千五百亿法郎，比一九五○年的五千亿法郎增加了一倍多。这些事实难道不是最明显地说明了谁在疯狂地准备战争吗？在实行侵略、扩大战争的实际步调上，这三个帝国主义国家，尤其是美国，更日益加紧了。美国在侵朝战争中遭受到惨重的失败后，变本加厉地在亚洲积极进行重新武装日本，在欧洲积极进行武装西德，并操纵联合国通过了诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的可耻决定，以图造成扩大侵略战争的借口。这就使新战争的危险一步步严重了起来。
    但是战争并不是不可避免的。这里的关键，就是世界爱好和平的人民的奋斗。我们应该在世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的号召下，广泛地、积极地展开活动，争取早日缔结和平公约。世界爱好和平人民，尤其是美、英、法三国人民，要团结一切可能的力量，迫使美、英、法三国政府在世界和平理事会的这个伟大的宣言面前，表示它们对于和平的态度。这是一个严重的斗争，也是对美、英、法三国反动政府，尤其是美国政府发动新战争阴谋的一个切中要害的打击。
    在争取缔结五大国和平公约的斗争中，必须随时揭露帝国主义的一切破坏阴谋。诚如斯大林大元帅在对美国政客史塔生的谈话中所指出的，在国际和平合作的道路上，“合作的可能性是经常存在的，然而却不一定经常有合作的意愿”。如果美、英、法三国反动政府竟悍然拒绝了世界爱好和平人民的和平要求，那就最后暴露了它们发动新战争的侵略决心。其结果必然是杜鲁门、艾德礼、普利文之流的战争贩子们，在人民当中完全陷于孤立。那么，战争贩子也就更加接近于自己的失败了。
