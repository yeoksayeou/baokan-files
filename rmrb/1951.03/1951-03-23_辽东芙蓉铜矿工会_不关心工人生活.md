　　Furan Copper Mine Union in Liaodong Doesn't Care About Workers' Lives
	Editor:
　　At the state-owned Furan Copper Mine in Zhuanghe County, Liaodong Province, the food and lodging conditions for the workers are very poor, and many are sick. On the evening of March 1st this year, I went to the workers' dormitory to see patients (I work at the mine's clinic). It was snowing heavily and the wind was blowing hard, but five or six windows had no glass. The kangs [heated brick beds] were not heated, and there was no grass mat under the kang mats. After the stoves were installed, they were never lit because there was no firewood. The workers just went to sleep wearily on the cold kangs. I asked them, "Why don't you find a way to ask the union and the administration to improve the dormitory environment?" The workers replied, "It's not like we haven't asked. Anyway, they only care if they themselves are cold or not."
　　The workers at the Furan Mine often can't take a bath for weeks. As worker Cong Tianzeng said, "When we want to take a bath, the water is either too cold or too dirty." The dormitory environment is very dirty, and no one cleans it. Because there is no one specifically in charge of food, the workers often eat cold food. Sometimes the corn buns are raw, sour, and hard, and they can't be eaten, so the workers just drink some cold water and go to work. These living conditions seriously affect their production morale.
　　Originally, the union should be concerned about the workers' welfare, but the mine's union seriously neglects the workers' interests. In the past, the workers voluntarily organized themselves to study, but now they do nothing but work. The union ignores this. As worker Li Zhaoping said, "The union is really useless now, it doesn't do anything."

　　Editor's note: The Furan Copper Mine Union in Liaodong Province's neglect of workers' lives and serious detachment from the masses must be changed. Please conduct an immediate inspection by the superior union of the said union.

### 辽东芙蓉铜矿工会  不关心工人生活

　　辽东芙蓉铜矿工会
    不关心工人生活编辑同志：
    辽东省庄河县公营芙蓉铜矿，工友们的食宿条件很差，生病的人也相当的多。今年三月一日晚上，我到工友宿舍去看病（我在该矿卫生所工作）。这时正下着大雪，刮着大风，但五、六个窗口没有玻璃。炕也没有烧，炕席下面也没有垫一点草。火炉子装好后，因为没有柴，也没有生过一回火。工友们就这样在凉炕上疲倦地睡着。我问他们“怎么不想法子，找工会和行政改善宿舍的环境”，工友们回答说：“我们不是没要求过，反正他们只管自己不冷就可以了。”
    芙蓉矿的工友们经常几个星期也不能洗一次澡，正像工友丛田增所说那样：“想去洗澡，可是水不是太凉，就是太脏。”宿舍的环境很肮脏，也无人打扫。因为没有专人负责搞伙食，工友们经常吃凉饭，有时候窝窝头是生的，又酸又硬，不能吃，工友们就随便喝点凉水就上班去了。这种生活条件，严重地影响了他们的生产情绪。
    本来工会是应该关心工人福利的，可是该矿工会却严重地忽视工人利益。以前工人们自动组织起来学习，现在除了上班外，什么也不干。工会对此也置之不理。正如工人李兆平所说：“现在工会实在不像样子，啥也不干了。”
                    李济生
    编者按：辽东省芙蓉铜矿工会不关心工人生活，严重脱离群众的现象必须改变。请该工会的上级工会速作检查。
