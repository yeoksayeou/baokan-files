Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: Seven anti-aircraft gunners from the Second Platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on the north bank of the Han River, shot down and damaged five American planes at the cost of nine hundred bullets from light machine guns in four days from March 3rd to 6th.

At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of March 3rd, when Platoon Leader Ma of the Second Platoon and his six comrades were guarding a machine gun position on a hilltop, four F-80 American jet fighters swooped down and strafed peaceful residents below the mountain. Platoon Leader Ma issued the order to fire. Three machine guns aimed and fired simultaneously, and angry bullets wove a crossfire in the air. One jet fighter's fuel tank was hit and caught fire, falling to the left with a trail of thick smoke; another enemy plane was also hit and flew wobbly towards the south bank of the Han River.

At 2:40 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, four American jet planes flew over and swooped down to strafe the hilltop. The brave soldiers fought back valiantly, and this time they shot down and damaged one enemy plane each.

Having been severely punished twice, the enemy planes dared not fly low near the hilltop guarded by the brave soldiers anymore. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, an enemy reconnaissance plane shamelessly conducted so-called "broadcasting appeals" over the brave soldiers' position using a loudspeaker. At this time, the brave soldiers angrily fired a barrage of bullets, hitting the tail of the enemy plane. The enemy plane, emitting thick smoke, somersaulted twice and crashed into the Han River. The brave soldiers laughed and said, "Today we shot down Truman's loudspeaker."

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th: Ding Wenxiu, deputy squad leader of the Second Squad of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, shot down an American invading army jet fighter with a light machine gun on February 2nd in a certain area on the east coast of Korea.

At 2:00 PM that afternoon, three American jet fighters flew from the east coast and strafed a village near Ding Wenxiu's position. Ding Wenxiu picked up a light machine gun and fired at the enemy plane. The enemy plane turned around and swooped down on him in turn, causing dust and smoke to fly around him. His fortifications were also destroyed; the machine gun was buried in the soil and malfunctioned. Under the cover of friendly fire, he quickly moved to the back of a grave mound and repaired the bolt. He stared at the enemy plane in the smoke. When an enemy plane swooped down to strafe, he aimed at its head and fired a burst of bullets. The plane immediately emitted thick smoke, and fled erratically. The remaining two enemy planes also fled. Soon, cadres from the local county people's committee brought gifts to慰問this hero who shot down the enemy plane. They saw the enemy plane, trailing thick smoke, crash on the coast thirty miles away from the garrison.

Ding Wenxiu had seen many atrocities committed by American planes, wantonly destroying the lives and property of peaceful Korean people. He had lived with a Korean family, and the landlord's house was destroyed by American planes. The Korean old lady, who treated him like her own son, was killed, and the landlord's son, who often sang to him, was also injured. In order to shoot down American planes to avenge the landlord's old lady and young brother, as well as the millions of Korean people, he angrily joined the anti-aircraft shooting group. He dug fortifications on the frozen hilltop and guarded them day and night. He had driven away enemy planes many times, but had never been able to shoot one down. So he actively studied technology and tirelessly studied ways to shoot down planes with other shooters. This time, he finally shot down an American plane.

    用轻机枪对空射击
    击落击伤美机六架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】汉江北岸的中国人民志愿军某部第二排的七位对空射击手，在三月三日至六日的四天内，用轻机枪以九百发子弹的代价击落和击伤美机五架。
    三日下午五时，当第二排的马排长和他的六个战友守卫在一座山头的机枪阵地上时，四架Ｆ八○型的美国喷气战斗机向山下和平居民俯冲扫射。马排长发出了射击命令。三挺机枪瞄准齐发，愤怒的子弹在空中交织成交叉火网，一架喷气机的油箱被射中而起火，拖着一股浓烟向左方坠落；另一架敌机也被击中向汉江南岸摇幌飞逃。
    五日下午二时四十分，四架美国喷气式飞机飞来向着山头俯冲扫射。勇士们奋勇迎击，这次又打落与打伤敌机各一架。
    受到了两次严惩后的敌机再也不敢在勇士们所据守的山头附近低飞了。六日下午四点钟，敌人的一架侦察机用播音器在勇士们阵地上空无耻地进行所谓“播音喊话”。这时，勇士们愤怒地射出连珠似的子弹，敌机被击中尾部，冒着浓烟翻了两个筋斗坠落在汉江中。勇士们欢笑着说：“今天打掉了杜鲁门的一个传声筒。”
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】中国人民志愿军某部第二班副班长丁文修，于二月二日在朝鲜东海岸某地，用轻机枪击落了美国侵略军喷气式飞机一架。
    是日下午两点钟，三架美国喷气式飞机从东海岸飞来，向丁文修阵地附近的村庄扫射。丁文修端起轻机枪向敌机射击。敌机就掉转头来向他轮番俯冲扫射，打得他周围尘土飞扬，烟雾弥漫。他的工事也被打塌了；机枪被泥土埋住，发生了故障。他在友邻火力掩护下迅速转移到一个坟包后面，把枪机修好。他在烟雾中目不转睛地盯住敌机。当一架敌机俯冲下来扫射时，他瞄准它的头部，射出一梭子弹。这架飞机立刻冒出浓烟，歪着机身，摇幌而逃。其余两架敌机也逃走了。不久，当地的郡人民委员会的干部带了慰劳品前来慰问这位击落敌机的英雄。他们看到那架拖着浓烟的敌机坠落在离驻地三十里外的海岸上。
    丁文修曾看见了许许多多美国飞机疯狂地毁灭朝鲜和平人民的生命财产的暴行。他曾住在一家朝鲜老百姓那里，那家房东的房子就是被美国飞机炸毁的。对待他像对待亲生儿子般的朝鲜老太太被炸死，常唱歌给他听的房东的儿子也被炸伤。为了打下美国飞机来给房东老太太和小弟弟以及千千万万的朝鲜人民报仇，他愤怒地加入了对空射击组。他在冰冻的山头上挖掘了工事，日夜守候在那里。他把敌机打走了好多次，可是总没有能打下来。于是他积极地学习技术，不倦地和旁的射手们一起研究打飞机的办法。这次终于打下了一架美国飞机。
