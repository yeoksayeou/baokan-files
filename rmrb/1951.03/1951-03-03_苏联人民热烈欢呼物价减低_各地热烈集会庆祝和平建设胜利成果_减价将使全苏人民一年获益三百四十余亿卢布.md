　　(Dispatch from this newspaper) Combined reports from Xinhua News Agency and TASS, Moscow, March 1st: The news of price reductions in the Soviet Union was broadcast on the radio on the evening of February 28th. This joyous news spread like lightning across the Soviet land, causing a thunderous cheer. The result of this price reduction will benefit the entire Soviet people by 27.5 billion rubles annually and will affect price reductions in the collective farm market, benefiting the people by 7 billion rubles. People in various regions held enthusiastic celebration rallies, unanimously believing that this is the result of the victorious achievements of peaceful construction in the Soviet Union and a vivid manifestation of the great Stalin's concern for the working people.
    On February 28th, industrial enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Tbilisi, and other cities in the Soviet Union held grand rallies during the evening shift. Workers said in their speeches: The recent price reduction in the Soviet Union is the most conclusive and indisputable proof that the Soviet state has peaceful intentions. In our country, civil industry is expanding to the maximum, the construction of huge hydropower stations and irrigation systems is underway, and the well-being of the people is constantly improving.
    Ivanov, the workshop director of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, said: "We are reaping the fruits of our peaceful labor. The American and British imperialists are eager to launch a new war to seize huge profits, but we, the Soviet people, are continuing to implement the policy of preventing war and defending peace with all our strength." Kononenko, a planer at the Almaty Iron Foundry in the capital of Kazakhstan, said: "When American imperialism is desperately expanding its military budget and frantically attacking the living standards of the working people, our government is doing its best to make the people live more prosperously. I am determined to increase the country's wealth with Stakhanovite labor." Boryakov, chairman of the Voroshilov Collective Farm in the Voronezh region, said: "The peasants are welcoming the upcoming spring plowing with the determination to produce more agricultural products for the country." Yazenin, a worker at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, announced at the celebration rally that he would do two shifts' worth of work in one shift. Workers in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, expressed their desire to work better. The celebration meeting at the Kaganovich Shoe Factory in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, unanimously decided to defend peace and welcome the glorious May Day with new labor achievements.
    In Moscow, although twenty-three new stores had been added before the price reduction, the stores were still unusually crowded with customers on March 1st. The goods piled up like mountains in the stores, all marked with the new prices after the price reduction. In order to mark the new prices in stores and canteens, 11,000 people, including shop assistants, representatives of the district Soviets, and people from all walks of life, participated in the work on the evening of February 28th. As a result of the price reduction, Moscow citizens will benefit by 40 million rubles a month in the purchase of bread and 15 million rubles in the purchase of animal oils.
    The people of the republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia joyfully welcomed the government's decision. Mass rallies were held in the largest enterprises in Riga, Tallinn, Vilnius, and other cities. Engineer Diman said at the workers' rally at the Riga Electrical Machinery Factory: "At a time when the international situation is very tense, when the American and British aggressors are slaughtering the heroic Korean people and preparing to launch another world war, the Soviet Union is building communism, turning deserts into flourishing gardens. Our lives are becoming happier and brighter every day. Stalin recently told a reporter from Pravda that the Soviet government will continue to pursue a policy of peace and a policy of improving the people's lives. What the leader says, he does. Today we have received another inspiring proof." News of rallies was also received from Petrozavodsk, the capital of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, Almaty, the Kuznetsk Coal Basin in Siberia, and other cities in the Soviet Union. Workers in Tashkent, livestock breeders in Bukhara and Kara-Kalpak, and construction workers on the Turkmen Canal expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government. They are determined to wage an unremitting struggle for the further upsurge of the Soviet Union's national economy under the leadership of the Leninist-Stalinist Party.

　　苏联人民热烈欢呼物价减低
    各地热烈集会庆祝和平建设胜利成果
    减价将使全苏人民一年获益三百四十余亿卢布
    【本报讯】综合新华社和塔斯社莫斯科一日消息：苏联减低物价的消息，在二月二十八日晚上就在无线电台上广播出来了。这个喜讯像闪电般传遍了苏维埃国土，引起了一片雷动的欢呼。这次减价的结果将使全苏人民一年获益二百七十五亿卢布，并将影响集体农场市场减价，使人民获益七十亿卢布。各地人民纷纷举行了热烈庆祝集会，他们一致认为这是苏联和平建设胜利的成果，是伟大斯大林关怀劳动人民的生动表现。
    二月二十八日莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、第比利斯和苏联其他城市的工业企业，在晚班时间都举行了盛大的集会。工人们在他们的演说中说：苏联最近这一次减低物价乃是苏维埃国家具有和平愿望的最确凿的、无可置辩的明证。在我们国家里，民用工业正在扩大到最大限度，庞大的水电站和灌溉系统的建造正在进行，人民的福利正在不断地增进。
    莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的车间长伊凡诺夫说：“我们正收获着自己和平劳动的果实。美英帝国主义者渴望发动新战争来攫取巨额利润，但我们苏联人民却以一切力量来继续实行阻止战争、保卫和平的政策。”哈萨克首都阿拉木图铸铁厂刨工康诺宁科说：“当美帝国主义拼命膨胀军事预算并疯狂地向劳动人民生活水准进攻的时候，我们政府却尽力使人民生活得更富裕。我决心以斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动来增加国家的财富。”佛罗内兹州伏罗希洛夫集体农场主席波里雅柯夫说：“农民们正怀着为国家生产更多的农产品的决心来迎接行将到来的春耕。”列宁格勒基洛夫工厂工人雅曾宁在庆祝会上宣布要一班做两班的工作。乌克兰首都基辅的工人表示要更好的劳动。白俄罗斯首都明斯克卡冈诺维奇鞋厂的庆祝大会一致决定以新的劳动成绩来保卫和平和迎接光荣的五一节。
    在莫斯科，虽然在减价前已添设了二十三个新商店，但三月一日商店里的顾客仍异常拥挤。店里堆积如山的货物，都标着减价后的新价格。为了标定商店和食堂的新价目，二月二十八日晚，除店员外，还有区苏维埃代表和社会人士一万一千人参加了工作。由于减价的结果，莫斯科市民在购买面包方面一个月将获益四千万卢布，在购买动物油方面获益一千五百万卢布。
    立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚各共和国的人民欢欣鼓舞地欢迎政府的决定。里加、塔林、维尔那以及其他城市的最大的企业中都举行了群众集会。工程师第曼在里加电气机器制造厂的工人集会上说：“正当国际形势非常紧张的时候，正当美英侵略者在杀戮英勇的朝鲜人民和准备发动另一次世界大战的时候，苏联却在建设共产主义的工程，把沙漠变为繁花盛开的花园。我们的生活一天比一天更加幸福、更加光明。斯大林最近对真理报记者发表谈话说，苏联政府将继续奉行和平政策，改善人民生活的政策。领袖是说什么就做什么的。今天我们又得到了一个令人振奋的证明。”卡累利阿——芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国首都彼得罗萨佛德斯克、阿拉木图、西伯利亚库兹涅茨克煤矿盆地，以及苏联其他地区的城市都传来了举行大会的消息。塔什干的工人、布克哈拉和卡拉·卡尔巴克的牲畜饲养者、土库曼运河的建筑工人都向布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府表示由衷的感谢。他们决心在列宁斯大林党的领导下，为了苏联的国民经济的进一步高涨而进行不倦的斗争。
