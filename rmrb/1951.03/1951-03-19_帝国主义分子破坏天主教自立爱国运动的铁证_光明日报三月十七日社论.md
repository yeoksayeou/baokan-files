Ironclad Proof of Imperialist Elements Sabotaging the Catholic Church's Independent Patriotic Movement
—Guangming Daily March 17th Editorial

　　The so-called "Study Reference" issued by imperialist elements within the Catholic Church, disclosed by this newspaper on the 13th of this month, has aroused serious attention and indignation from all quarters. This is ironclad proof that imperialist elements within the Catholic Church are attempting to sabotage the Catholic Church's independent and innovative patriotic movement. Some imperialist elements, disguised as missionaries, are still attempting to use Catholicism as an instrument of aggression for the US-Chiang clique to undermine the interests of the Chinese people. This so-called "Study Reference" is ironclad proof of this.

　　Since the launch of our people's vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the broad masses of patriotic people in religious circles have also joined this great cause. Chinese Christian figures such as Wu Yaozong published the "Pathways for Chinese Christianity's Efforts in the Construction of New China" declaration on September 23rd of last year, calling on Christians across the country to promote the innovation movement of Christianity. Wang Liangzuo, a Chinese priest of the Catholic Church in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, led more than 500 Catholics in a conference, issuing a declaration advocating severing all ties with imperialism and establishing a new church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. Since then, Chinese Catholic figures have also begun an independent and innovative patriotic movement. Like the Chinese Christian Church, the Chinese Catholic Church was controlled by imperialist elements in terms of organization, system, economy, ideology, and undertakings. If Chinese Catholics want to truly gain the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to love their country, they must sever all ties with imperialism, and first of all, get rid of the direct control of these imperialist elements. Therefore, people from all walks of life across the country have expressed warm welcome and support for the independent and innovative patriotic movement of Catholic figures.

　　Currently, imperialist elements within the Catholic Church are doing everything they can to resist and sabotage this independent patriotic movement. In the secret document of the so-called "Study Reference" (please note, readers, that this document has been approved by the church), they use another set of "meanings of the Three-Selfs" to distort and slander the genuine Three-Self movement of patriotic Chinese Catholics, using "schism" and "violation of doctrine and canon law" to intimidate the broad masses of believers who support the Three-Self movement, and using "hindering the transcendence of the church" to prevent believers from participating in patriotic movements.

　　The "self-governance" in the Three-Self movement is to free Chinese churches and church undertakings from the control and influence of imperialism and its running dogs, and to be handled entirely by the Chinese themselves. This is naturally resented by imperialist elements and their running dogs within the Chinese church, so they shamelessly slander it as "forcing growth or schismatic self-governance." However, the responsibility of all patriotic Chinese believers is to bravely break with imperialist forces. Either imperialist forces will rule the Chinese church, thus making the Chinese church continue to be a tool in the hands of imperialist aggressors and spies; or they will sever ties with imperialist forces once and for all, thus making the Chinese church a genuine religious undertaking, rather than a place to hide dirt and filth. One of the two must be chosen. All Chinese religious believers must make a choice.

　　The "self-support" in the Three-Self movement is to free the Chinese church from foreign economic relations, especially the economic relations of US imperialism. According to investigations, there are more than 130 dioceses in the Catholic Church in China, of which 13 are directly presided over by American priests, and 70 or 80 are subsidized by the American church or the so-called "Church Relief General Administration." The remaining 30 or 40 dioceses are superficially subsidized by the Roman Curia, but these subsidies are actually controlled by the United States, because 70% to 80% of the missionary expenses of the Roman Curia are donated by US imperialist elements. However, imperialist elements in the Catholic Church falsely claim that they "were originally self-supporting." Look, what a shameless lie this is! The reason why imperialist elements and their running dogs in the Chinese church want to make such despicable lies is to oppose the plan of the Chinese church and church undertakings to achieve true self-support on the basis of self-reliance. Isn't this clear enough?

　　The "self-propagation" in the Three-Self movement concerns who is preaching, and what is being preached. The Chinese church has enough missionaries who understand what is in the interests of Chinese believers. Foreign missionaries are no longer needed, especially the missionaries of imperialist elements. However, imperialist elements in the Catholic Church believe that it is still "necessary to allow foreign missionaries to help preach, or to preside over church affairs for a certain period of time."

　　As everyone knows, Catholicism has been introduced into China for more than 300 years. Many foreign missionaries have held and manipulated the administrative, economic, and preaching powers of the Chinese church, and have never been willing to help Chinese believers build their own church. They use the name of preaching to carry out aggression and espionage. Their crimes are numerous, and public security organs in various places have uncovered many cases. It is precisely because of this unspeakable and despicable purpose that even today, when the Chinese people have won the victory of the revolution, the vast majority of Chinese Christians and Catholics are willing to fight for the establishment of their own church and actively launch an independent and innovative movement. These imperialist elements still insist that foreign missionaries preach in China, and shamelessly beautify it as "self-propagation"! What are they preaching? In a word, they attempt to place three million Catholics outside the ranks of Chinese people's patriotism. They call the independent and innovative movement of patriotic Chinese Catholics "such a so-called narrowly defined national Catholicism, which is just a schism." That is to say, Chinese believers are not allowed to have their own independent church, but only a church that is directly controlled and utilized by imperialist elements. Under the smoke screen of "transnational" and "transpolitical," imperialist elements attempt to make the Chinese Catholic Church continue to obey US imperialism and its subsidized international church organizations in order to carry out criminal activities that undermine the interests of the Chinese people. This secret document nakedly exposes their reactionary face.

　　On the one hand, imperialist elements in the Catholic Church firmly oppose the independent and innovative movement of Chinese believers, and firmly oppose Chinese believers' participation in the great patriotic movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, believing that this is "driven by forces outside the church," and "willing to break away from the church," and believing that this is an "activity with unclear meaning." On the other hand, under the direct instigation of the US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's secret service agencies, they use the Catholic Church as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. The two special agent organizations recently uncovered in Tianjin—the "Catholic National Salvation Corps Underground Work General Team Tianjin District Team" and the "Democratic National Construction Advancement Association Tianjin Branch"—were both special agent organizations formed and developed by Lei Zhenyuan, an international special agent who has now fled to the United States, using the Catholic Church. This proves how dangerous and degenerate the Catholic Church, which is currently manipulated by imperialist elements, has become. It is worth noting that even what they call the "Study Reference" is secretly distributed and dare not be made public. Now, reactionary elements in the church in some places are carrying out despicable acts of intimidation and deception among patriotic Chinese believers in accordance with the instructions of this secret document. This is intolerable to all patriotic Chinese people, and it is also intolerable to all patriotic Chinese believers.

　　The facts are very clear: imperialist elements do not allow Chinese Catholics to love their country and their church. Pure believers who want to love their country and their church must resolutely eliminate imperialist elements from the church. The vast majority of Catholics in China love their country and their church. Therefore, there is only one path before believers: resolutely implement the genuine Chinese Three-Self movement, so that the church truly becomes the church of Chinese believers, not a church controlled by foreign imperialism. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to resolutely expose the criminal acts of imperialist elements in the church and prevent them from having the possibility of occupying the church to carry out conspiracy activities.

　　We believe that the exposure of the secret document and the uncovering of the Tianjin special agent case will enable every loyal Catholic to further recognize the crimes of imperialist elements and strengthen their determination and courage to launch a patriotic struggle. Their struggle is bound to be victorious, because the patriotic movement of Catholics is a part of the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of the people of the whole country and is supported by all patriotic people.

　　Severing ties with imperialism in organization, economy, and ideology is by no means opposing religion itself, but ensuring the purity of religion from being defiled by imperialism; it is by no means violating freedom of religious belief, but ensuring freedom of religious belief from being hijacked by imperialism; it is by no means narrow-minded nationalism that excludes foreigners, but opposing the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism and ensuring the freedom of Chinese citizens who believe in Catholicism to love their country.

　　Chinese Catholics, unite and fight for the freedom to love our country and our church, and for the success of the independent and innovative movement!

　(Attached) Secret Document Issued by Imperialist Elements in the Catholic Church to Conspire to Sabotage the Independent and Innovative Movement
　　The secret document "Study Reference" issued by imperialist elements to sabotage the Catholic Church's independent patriotic movement is as follows:

　　Study Reference (Original note: Approved by the Church) CUM APPROBATIONE ECCLESIASTICA

　(1)

　　The Catholic Church was personally established by Jesus and passed down by the Apostles, a supremely unified, catholic, and holy church; a whole entity, like a body, with the Pope—Jesus' representative—as its head, which is transnational and transpolitical, and will not be divided by international disputes or political changes. This is the essence of Catholicism. What changes its nature is not Catholicism. Therefore, if Catholics in a certain place, due to environmental reasons, are willing to break away from religion, they break away from Jesus and break away from the church. Such a so-called narrowly defined "national Catholicism" is merely a schism, not the supremely unified and catholic true Catholicism. For this reason, faithful Catholics would rather give their lives than apostatize, creating the glorious history of Catholicism for two thousand years.

　　Although imperialist countries have all tried to use the Catholic Church, our Catholic Church has never accepted exploitation. Those who misunderstand Catholicism often falsely accuse the church as a whole because of a few individuals, which is truly unfortunate. This is what faithful Catholics cannot recognize. Therefore, we do not accept any remarks that insult the Pope and the Church or direct division, and there is no room for hesitation. Fellow believers, our Catholic Church has never had any connection with any imperialism, so there is no such thing as severing ties. If we admit to severing ties, it is equivalent to admitting that there was a connection.

　(2)

　　Fellow believers, we know that our Catholic Church has always practiced self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. The history of Catholicism spreading to various countries is all proven by facts and does not need special statements. We will now only explain the meaning of the Three-Selfs clearly to prevent unexpected statements, based on the essence of Catholicism:

　　1. Self-governance means: to gradually enable the missionary area to be governed by local bishops in accordance with canon law and to establish a formal system of the church. Isn't this what the Holy Church is gradually realizing? As for forcing growth or schismatic self-governance, that would lose the true meaning of self-governance.

　　2. Self-support means: the church does not accept any assistance from abroad or at home with political backgrounds; it only uses funds donated purely for the church by Catholics around the world to build the church, so as to make the local church as self-sufficient as possible. At the same time, each of us believers should do our best to donate and share the needs of the church as a whole. Therefore, the church itself is originally self-supporting. If we say that the financial resources of the entire church cannot flow freely; that the church in this country, this province, and this region is cut off from the church elsewhere; or even that believers cannot help each other, then that is not self-support. If the self-sufficiency of the local church becomes difficult, and the assistance from other churches is cut off, it will inevitably become draining the pond to catch the fish, or being bought out, or disintegrating. How is this self-support?

　　3. Self-propagation means: foreign missionaries preach from the standpoint of the church for the benefit of the local church, not for the benefit of the foreign country, and should do their best to cultivate local priests to make them sufficient for self-propagation. However, when local priests have not been fully produced or are not sufficient for the needs of evangelization, then it is necessary to allow foreign missionaries to help preach or preside over the ministry for a certain period of time. At the same time, each of us believers should exert our evangelistic power to promote the mission of self-propagation; otherwise, it will not be self-propagation, but non-propagation.

　　Three-Selfs that are not explained according to the meaning of Catholicism are wrong. External remarks have been sufficient to prove this point. Therefore, faithful Catholics should pay close attention and carefully examine the content and motives in advance, especially to prevent qualitative changes afterward, so as to avoid misunderstanding and straying from the path. All Three-Selfs that are driven by forces outside the church, rather than automatic, are not genuine Three-Selfs. We should realize our own consistent Three-Self principles under the leadership of the priests and argue on the basis of reason to improve all the bad situations that hinder the Three-Selfs.

　　Fellow believers, we know that: on the one hand, the Catholic Church is transcendent and will never go beyond the scope of faith and morality to interfere in politics. In addition, church laws strictly prohibit priests from engaging in political activities with the transcendent status of dedicating themselves to the church. However, the church has no compulsory power other than religious punishments. Of course, the church cannot be responsible for the behavior of those who violate the prohibition, and the church has no power to go beyond the scope of religion, violate the spirit of religion, and impose sanctions.

　　On the other hand, Catholic doctrine strictly commands believers to love their country. Faithful Catholics should naturally promote the spirit of patriotism to fulfill the duty of Catholic believers to love their country; and based on their conscience and justice, truly serve the country and the people.

　　However, for all political activities, believers must be responsible for themselves in their capacity as citizens and should not use the name of the church as a political tool; in particular, they should not mix political activities with purely religious internal activities to hinder the transcendence of the church. Therefore, we should seriously consider activities with unclear meaning.

　　Faithful Catholics must resolutely grasp the essence of the church, protect religious belief, and absolutely not engage in behaviors that violate doctrine and canon law. Fellow believers, complete faith is a priceless treasure. It cannot be preserved by breaking away from the church and breaking away from the priests—Jesus' representatives. Then, faithful Catholics, no matter in any difficult and arduous situation, should pray, practice self-restraint, and love each other sincerely to prove our strong and unchanging faith like a rock.

　　帝国主义分子破坏天主教自立爱国运动的铁证
    ——光明日报三月十七日社论
    本月十三日本报披露的天主教中帝国主义分子发出的所谓《学习参考》，已引起各方面的严重注意和愤慨。这是天主教中帝国主义分子企图破坏天主教的自立革新的爱国运动的铁证。有一些披着传教士外衣的帝国主义分子，仍在企图利用天主教作为美蒋破坏中国人民利益的侵略工具，这个所谓《学习参考》，就是铁证。
    自从我国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动展开以后，宗教界的广大爱国分子也投入了这个伟大的行列。中国基督教人士吴耀宗等，于去年九月二十三日发表了《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》宣言，号召全国基督教徒推动基督教的革新运动。川北广元县天主教中国神父王良佐领导五百余天主教徒召开大会，发表宣言，主张与帝国主义割断各方面的关系，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会。中国的天主教人士从此也开始了自立革新的爱国运动。中国的天主教会，和中国的基督教会一样，在组织上、制度上、经济上、思想上、事业上，无不为帝国主义分子所控制。中国的天主教人士要真正取得宗教信仰的自由，要取得爱自己国家的自由，就必须斩断对帝国主义的一切联系，首先是摆脱这些帝国主义分子的直接控制。因此，全国各界人士对于天主教人士的自立革新的爱国运动，都表示热烈的欢迎和支持。
    目前天主教中的帝国主义分子正以全力来反抗和破坏这个自立爱国运动。在所谓《学习参考》的秘密文件中（请读者注意，这个文件是经教会批准的），他们以另一套的“三自的意义”来曲解和诬蔑中国爱国的天主教徒的真正的三自运动，以“裂教”和《违反教义和教规》来恐吓拥护三自运动的广大教徒，以“妨害教会的超然性”，来阻止教徒参加爱国运动。
    三自运动中的自治，是要使中国教会和教会事业，脱离帝国主义及其走狗的控制和影响，完全由中国人自己来办理。这当然是中国教会中帝国主义分子及其走狗所嫉恨的，因此他们就无耻地诬蔑这是“拔苗助长，或裂教式的自治”。但是一切爱国的中国教徒的责任，正是要勇敢地和帝国主义势力决裂。或者是帝国主义势力统治中国教会，因而使中国教会继续做帝国主义侵略分子和间谍分子手中的工具；或者是与帝国主义势力一刀两断，因而使中国教会成为真正的宗教事业，而不是藏垢纳污的所在。二者必居其一。一切中国宗教信徒必须加以抉择。
    三自运动中的自养，是要中国教会脱离外国的经济关系，尤其是美帝国主义的经济关系。据调查，在中国的天主教有一百三十多个教区，直接由美国教士主持的就有十三个教区，由美国教会或所谓“教会救济总署”津贴的，有七八十个教区，其余三四十个教区在表面上是受罗马教廷的津贴，但是这些津贴实际上还是受美国控制的，因为罗马教廷百分之七八十的传教费，是由美帝国主义分子捐助的，而天主教中帝国主义分子却诡称“本来就是自养”。请看，这是多么无耻的撒谎啊！中国教会中的帝国主义分子及其走狗们，所以要作这种卑劣的谎言，其目的是要反对中国教会和教会事业在自力更生基础上，实现真正自养的计划。这难道还不明白吗？
    三自运动中的自传，一方面是什么人去传的问题，同时也是传什么的问题。中国教会已有足够的传教士，他们懂得什么是符合于中国教徒利益的东西，不再需要外籍传教士，尤其不再需要帝国主义分子的传教士。而天主教中帝国主义分子却认为目前仍“不得不让外籍教士帮助传教，或在一定时期内主持教务”。
    人所共知，天主教传入中国已有三百多年的历史。许多外国传教士把持操纵中国教会的行政权、经济权和传教权，从来就不愿意帮助中国教徒建立自己的教会。他们借传教之名，行侵略和间谍之实，他们的罪案累累，各地人民公安机关已破获不少。正是因为抱着这个不可告人的卑鄙目的，所以直到今天，当中国人民已取得了革命的胜利，中国的基督教徒和天主教徒绝大多数愿意为建立自己的教会而奋斗前进，积极展开自立革新运动的时候，他们这批帝国主义分子还坚持外国传教士在中国传教，并无耻地美其名曰“自传”！他们传的又是什么东西呢？一句话，他们企图使三百万天主教徒置身于中国人民的爱国主义行列之外。他们把爱国的中国天主教徒的自立革新运动，称为“这样的所谓狭义的某国天主教，只是裂教”。这就是说，中国教徒是不准有自己的独立的教会的，只准有被帝国主义分子所直接控制和利用的教会。帝国主义分子企图在“超国际”、“超政治”的烟幕下，使中国的天主教会继续服从于美帝国主义及其所津贴的国际教会组织，以进行破坏中国人民利益的罪恶活动。这个秘密文件赤裸裸地暴露了他们的反动面目。
    天主教中的帝国主义分子一方面坚决反对中国教徒的自立革新运动，坚决反对中国教徒参加抗美援朝的伟大爱国运动，认为这是“受教外的驱使”，“甘愿脱离教会”，认为这是“意义不清的活动”。另一方面，他们在美帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮特务机关的直接指使之下，以天主教教会为掩护，进行反革命的破坏活动。最近天津所破获的两个特务组织——“公教报国团地下工作总队平津区队”和“民主建国协进会天津支部”，都是由现已逃往美国的国际特务雷震远利用天主教所组成和发展的特务组织。这证明目前在帝国主义分子操纵下的天主教教会，已经到了怎样危险和堕落的地步。值得注意的是，连他们自称为所谓《学习参考》，也是秘密散发的，是不敢公开拿出来见天日的。现在，若干地方的教会中的反动分子，正是按照了这个秘密文件的指示，不约而同地在中国的爱国教徒中进行威吓和欺骗的卑鄙行为。这是一切爱国的中国人民所不能容忍的，这也是一切爱国的中国教徒所不能容忍的。
    事实很清楚：帝国主义分子是不许中国天主教徒爱国爱教的。纯正的教徒要爱国爱教，就必须断然清除教会中的帝国主义分子。中国绝大多数的天主教徒，都是爱国爱教的。因此摆在教徒面前的只有一条道路：坚决实行真正中国人的三自运动，使教会真正成为中国教徒自己的教会，而不是外国帝国主义所控制的教会。为了达到这个目的，就要坚决地揭露教会中的帝国主义分子的罪恶行为，并使他们不再有盘踞教会进行阴谋活动的可能。
    我们相信，秘密文件的暴露和天津特务案件的破获，使每一个忠实的天主教徒进一步认识帝国主义分子的罪恶，加强他们展开爱国斗争的决心和勇气。他们的斗争一定是能够获得胜利的，因为天主教徒的爱国运动，是全国人民的反帝爱国运动中的一部分，是为全体爱国的人民所支持的。
    从组织上、经济上、思想上割断与帝国主义的关系，这决不是反对宗教的本身而是保障宗教的纯洁性免受帝国主义的奸污；这决不是违背信教自由，而是保障宗教信仰自由，免受帝国主义的劫持；这决不是排外的狭隘民族主义，而是反对帝国主义的侵略阴谋，保障信仰天主教的中国公民的爱国自由。
    中国的天主教徒一致团结起来，为争取爱国爱教的自由，争取自立革新运动的成功而斗争！
  （附）天主教中帝国主义分子发出的阴谋破坏自立革新运动的秘
        密文件
    帝国主义分子破坏天主教自立爱国运动的秘密文件《学习参考》，全文如下：
    学习参考（原注：经教会批准）CUM APPROBATIONE ECEL FSIAS TICA
  （一）
    天主教系耶稣亲自建立，由宗徒传下来的，至一至公的神圣教会；整个一体，犹如一身，而以耶稣的代表——教宗——为首，是超国际，超政治的，不因国际纠纷，与政治变迁而分裂的。这是天主教的本质，变了质的就不是天主教，故此，天主教徒倘在某地，因环境关系，而甘愿脱离宗教，就是脱离了耶稣，脱离了教会，这样的所谓狭义的“某国天主教”，只是裂教，不是至一至公的真正天主教。为此，忠实的天主教徒，因不愿背教而甘愿效命，造成了天主教二千年的光荣历史。
    帝国主义国家，虽然都想利用天主教，但吾天主教教会，决未接受利用。误会天主教的人，往往因少数个人，而诬陷教会整体，真是不幸；这是忠实的天主教徒，所不能承认的，故此，对于污辱教宗与教会，或导演分裂的言论，概不接受，毫无游移的余地。教胞们，吾天主教教会，与任何帝国主义，既不曾发生联系，自无所谓斩断联系；倘若承认斩断联系，就等于承认发生过联系。
  （二）
    教胞们，我们知道，吾天主教向来实行自治、自养、自传；天主教传到各国的历史，究竟都是事实证明，本不需要特别声明，我们现在只将三自的意义，解释清楚，以防意外的讲法，根据天主教的本质：
    一、自治就是：要使传教区，渐由本籍主教，遵照教规，治理教务，而成立教会正式体制，这不是圣教会逐步在实现着的吗？至于拔苗助长，或裂教式的自治，那便失掉了自治的真谛。
    二、自养就是：教会不接受国外以及国内任何有政治背景的资助；只用天下一体的天主教徒，纯为教会所捐献的款项，来建设教会，务使当地教会，能够尽量自给，同时我们每一位教胞，都该竭力捐献，分担教会整体的需要，故此教会本身，本来就是自养的，若说使教会整个一体的财力，不能全身流通；使在此国、此省、此区的教会，与在他处的教会断绝；甚至使教友间，彼此不能互助，那就不是自养了。倘使当地教会的自给发生困难，而他处教会的接济又告断绝，势成竭池而渔，或被收买，或遭解体，这何尝是自养呢？
    三、自传就是：外籍传教士，以教会的立场，为本地教会的利益而传教，不为外籍的利益而工作，并当竭力培植本籍教士，使之足以自传。但于本籍教士尚未充分产生，或不够传教需要的时候，那就不得不让外籍教士帮助传教，或在一定时期内主持传教，而同时我们每一位教胞，都该发挥我们的传教力量，促使自传的使命，否则，就不是自传，而是不传。
    不依天主教的意义而说明的三自，就是错误。外界的言论已经足够证明此点，故此，忠实的天主教徒，应该深切注意，事前当察内容与动机，尤须预防事后变质，以免误会而入歧途。凡受教外的驱使，而非自动的三自，必非真正的三自，我们应当在神长领导之下，实现我们自己一贯的三自原则。并且据理力争，改善一切妨碍三自的恶劣处境。
    教胞们，我们知道：一方面，天主教教会是超然的，决不越出信仰与道德的范围，而干涉政治。加以教会法令，又严禁司铎以献身教会的超然身份，作政治活动。然而，教会除宗教处分外，别无强制性的权力，对于犯禁者的行为，教会当然不能负责，教会更无权力，超出宗教范围，违反宗教精神，而加以制裁。
    另一方面，天主教教义，严命教友爱国，忠实的天主教徒，为尽教友爱国的天职，自当发扬爱国精神；各本天良以及正义，真正地为国为民，而努力服务。
    但对一切政治活动，教友须以公民身份，自己负责，不当假借教会名义，作为政治工具；尤不当使政治活动，与纯宗教的内部活动混在一起，妨害教会的超然性，故此，对于意义不清的活动，自当郑重考虑。
    忠实的天主教徒，必须坚决地，把握教会本质，保障宗教信仰，绝对不作违反教义与教规的行为。教胞们，完整的信德，即是无价之宝。不能脱离教会，脱离神长——耶稣的代表——而保存的。那末，忠实的天主教徒，无论在任何艰难困苦之中，自当祈祷，克己，精诚相爱，证明我们刚强不变如同磐石的信德。
