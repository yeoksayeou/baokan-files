Editor's Note: This is a comprehensive report written by the Policy Research Office of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China based on investigation materials from sixteen villages in ten counties across the four provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Songjiang, and Liaodong. It reflects certain conditions in the old liberated areas of Northeast China.

(I) The rural economy has developed quite rapidly, and middle peasants have become the majority in rural areas.

According to investigations in typical villages in various parts of Northeast China, agricultural production in 1950 exceeded the highest pre-war production levels. For example, in the villages of Shengli, Xinfa, and Xinli in Baicheng County, Heilongjiang, total output exceeded that of 1943 by 22%. Yao Fort Village in Hulan, Songjiang, exceeded that of 1944 by 18.09%. Unit yields in most villages also exceeded the level of 1943. For example, unit yield in Guyu Village in Hulan, Songjiang, exceeded that of 1943 by 6.75%, Yao Fort Village exceeded it by 13.19%, and Xiaobao Village and Xiaobao Hamlet in Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, exceeded it by 37.5%.

The number of carts and livestock has increased significantly. In Shengli and Xinli villages in Baicheng County, there were 35 large carts, 84 plows, 34 harrows, and 56 small farm tools in 1943. In 1950, there were 99 large carts (including one rubber-wheeled cart), 152 plows, 49 harrows, and 1,484 small farm tools. Livestock and farm tools also increased in Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou County, Heilongjiang. In 1945, there were 34 carts and 49 harrows; in 1950, there were 68 carts and 98 harrows. The increase in livestock is as follows: In the three villages of Baicheng County, there were 159 horses and mules, 76 head of cattle, and 50 donkeys in 1943; in 1950, there were 126 horses and mules, 72 head of cattle, and 278 donkeys. This shows that while the number of large livestock has decreased slightly, the number of small livestock (donkeys) has increased significantly. Another example is West Xiaobao Hamlet in Fengcheng County: in 1945, there were 6 horses and mules, 40 head of cattle, and 16 donkeys; in 1950, there were 11 horses and mules, 59 head of cattle, and 35 donkeys, with increases in both large and small livestock.

Farmers have more surplus grain. In Jiefang Village, Yushu, Jilin, with 536 households and 1,217.75 hectares of land, the surplus grain in 1950 (excluding public grain, consumption for people and livestock, and seeds) was 1,046,680 jin, accounting for 47% of the total output. Among them, 2 households had more than 100 shi of surplus grain, 10 households had 40 to 50 shi, 20 households had 20 to 30 shi, 178 households had around 10 shi, and 286 households had 3 to 5 shi. In Tuanjie Village, Panshi, Jilin, with 227 households and 479.74 hectares of land (half a hectare of paddy field), the surplus grain was 595,000 jin, accounting for more than one-third of the total output, with an average of 2,621 jin of surplus grain per household. In Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou, Heilongjiang, with 336 households, after deducting public grain, consumption for people and livestock, seeds, and general living and production materials, the surplus grain was 208.8 shi in 1948, 202.6 shi in 1949, and 957 shi in 1950. Households with surplus grain accounted for 56.63% of the total number of households. A survey of 17 households in Soudeng Station, Yongji, Jilin, showed a total surplus grain of 21,376 jin, accounting for 14.7% of agricultural income. In Yao Fort Village, Hulan, Songjiang, with 214 households, 151 households had surplus grain, totaling 383,200 jin, accounting for 18% of the total output; among them, one household had more than 50 shi of surplus grain, two households had more than 30 shi, six households had 20 to 25 shi, four households had 8 to 15 shi, and 102 households had 1 to 5 shi. In the three villages of Baicheng, 87 households had surplus grain, accounting for 26.6% of the total output and 27% of the total number of households.

Purchasing power has also increased with the development of agriculture and sideline occupations. Taking the purchasing power of Xinfa Village in Baicheng as 100% in 1948, it was 168% in 1949, and decreased to 142% in 1950 due to drought. The purchasing power of Sidao Yanchang in Qingyuan, Liaodong, taking the farmers' purchasing power in 1948 as 100%, was 175.2% in 1949 and 207.40% in 1950. This data can represent the situation in medium-sized villages.

Furthermore, in the three villages of Baicheng, 86 new houses have been built in the past three years. Among them, Shengli Village has dug 20 Western-style wells (every well-off peasant household has one). In 1943, middle peasants bought an average of 15-20 chi of cloth per person, and poor peasants bought 12-14 chi. For food (including oil, salt, meat, noodles, and rice), middle peasants consumed 1.9 shi (60 jin per dou), and poor peasants consumed 1.75 shi. In 1950, middle peasants bought 35-50 chi of cloth, and poor peasants bought 25-30 chi. Middle peasants consumed 2.25 shi of food, and poor peasants consumed 2 shi. The lives of the peasants have undergone fundamental changes compared to the pre-war period.

The result of production development is that middle peasants have become the main class in rural areas. Most have risen in status, a small part have remained unchanged (but have also actually improved), and only a few have declined. This is the basic situation in rural areas today.

| Village Name      | Middle Peasants (including well-off middle peasants) | Poor Peasants | Hired Laborers | New Rich Peasants | Other  | Total Households |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|--------|------------------|
|                   | Households | %       | Households | %      | Households | %      | Households | %       | Households | %      |                |
| Baicheng (3 vills) | 212 (32 well-off)  | 63.85  | 109      | 32.83 | 5         | 1.50   | 6         | 1.82   |          |        | 332            |
| Jiaohe Huangou    | 186             | 58.00  | 136      | 42.00 |           |        |           |        |          |        | 332            |
| Panshi Tuanjie    | 156 (15 well-off) | 70.59  | 64       | 28.96 | 1         | 0.45   |           |        |          |        | 221            |
| Fengcheng Xiaobao | 43 (7 well-off)   | 51.20  | 41       | 48.80 |           |        |           |        |          |        | 84             |
| Shulan (3 vills)  | 581 (59 well-off) | 73.10  | 209      | 26.40 | 4         | 0.50   |           |        |          |        | 794            |
| Zhaozhou Fazhan   | 239 (12 well-off) | 70.52  | 99       | 29.19 | 1         | 0.29   |           |        |          |        | 339            |

In the three villages of Baicheng, middle peasants account for 63.8% of the total households, 67.3% of the population, 69.5% of the labor force, 87.5% of the livestock, 75.7% of the land, 86.4% of the large carts, and 76.8% of the total output. These facts show that middle peasants have played a significant role in agricultural production.

Land sales and hiring of labor have occurred in rural areas. For example, in Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou, Heilongjiang, six people sell their labor. Their original class status is as follows: one hired laborer, two poor peasants, one middle peasant, and two others (three of them sell labor because they have little land and a large labor force, not because their family economy has declined). In Tiande District, Shulan, Jilin, 14.67 hectares of land were sold in 1950. Hired laborers sold 73.2% of the land, poor peasants sold 12.3%, and middle peasants sold 15.5%. There are many reasons for selling land: (1) some are returning to Guannei; (2) some lack the means of production and cannot cultivate the land; (3) some are selling bad land to buy good land; (4) some are changing professions. Among these, the first, third, and fourth reasons for selling land are part of the re-adjustment of land, which is beneficial to production.

Although the rural economy has developed rapidly, the development is uneven. Some villages and households still face serious difficulties, especially in disaster areas and areas that were liberated later. Therefore, it is still necessary to pay serious attention to supporting the development of production in these areas.

(II) Some farmers in the plains who have risen faster are beginning to feel that the path to further development is not wide.

The purely agricultural socialist ideology has been basically overcome, but there are still remnants. For example, the masses (including village people's representatives and party members) in Kaoshan Village, Shulan, Jilin, are not clear enough about production policies. They say: "It is okay to hire people, but you can only hire part-timers and pig herders, not long-term laborers; you can work individually, but you are not allowed to use other conditions to restrict them; it is okay to get rich, but you should not get too rich." In Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou, three households wanted to hire laborers and six households wanted to work individually in 1950, but the cadres did not allow it. Lei Fengqi in the village had already bought a rubber-wheeled cart and wanted to work individually, but returned it because the village cadres criticized him for being "selfish and unsocial." Although this phenomenon exists, it is isolated. The basic problem now is not whether to dare to develop, but that some farmers who have developed faster have begun to feel the frustration of having no way to develop further. For example, in Xiaobao Hamlet, Fengcheng, five households wanted to buy rubber-wheeled carts, but could not afford them because they did not have the manpower and did not want to partner with others; four households wanted to hire people, but could not find them; and many people are not very interested in improving agricultural techniques, believing that "enough manure has been applied, enough grain has been harvested, and we have done our part." In Jiefang Village, Yushu, each laborer averages 19.22 mu of land, and instead of thinking of ways to cultivate intensively, they feel that "almost half of the labor force feels there is 'nothing to do'." Farmer Zhang Rufug in Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou, said, "It is not enough to just plant a little land; we must think of other ways to make money." But they "look down on sideline businesses that earn 30,000 to 50,000 yuan a day." For example, in West Xiaobao Hamlet, Fengcheng, weaving straw bags has a market, but everyone thinks it "makes money too slowly." Two villages have even begun to experience a decrease in livestock: in Jiefang Village, due to the shortage of land, the number of livestock decreased from 384 in 1950 to 300 (some are sold in winter and bought in spring, and some can be bought back); in West Xiaobao, there was no increase, but the number of large livestock decreased from 103 to 94, and farmers reflected that "our village cannot add any more livestock."

Because these problems have not been properly resolved in rural work, various ways of finding their own way out have emerged:

1. Some farmers use their surplus grain for lending at interest. For example, Yang Hengchun in Xiaobao Village lent more than 4,000 jin of japonica rice in the spring of 1950 and earned more than 2,000 jin of interest in the fall, which was enough to pay the public grain for the year. Old Jiang of the village wanted to buy pigs, but Ai Yongjin dissuaded him, saying, "Lending grain is more profitable than raising pigs." Shi Yukun of Jiangjiabao in the village had a surplus of 5,862 jin of japonica rice. After using 3,600 jin for agricultural production this year, he wanted to use the remaining 2,262 jin (accounting for 33.83%) for "batching green" [speculating on crops before harvest]. He bought 1,500 jin of japonica rice (batching green) with the money from selling 700 jin of japonica rice in May and June 1950. He said, "I won't do anything else; I can make a living just from the interest!" This shows that some people want to get rich by lending at interest. Li Xuezeng in Jiefang Village, Yushu, lent more than 100 shi of grain. He said, "Lending grain is less troublesome and less effort than farming."

2. Investing in commerce. Yang Hengchun, a middle peasant in Xiaobao Village, invested half of his shares in opening a pharmacy in early 1950. Over the past year, he and Ai Yongjin have also frequently deposited 3 to 5 million yuan in the cooperative, preparing for speculative activities. In addition, three party member cadres sold their oxen and also planned to open a rice milling factory with two farmers, but they did not have enough money to open it. Two other households went to Linkou to sell peanuts. All of these phenomena had not occurred in the village before 1949.

3. Middle peasants are very keen on building rubber-wheeled carts to make money by hauling goods. This is a common sentiment.

(III) Labor exchange and mutual aid have continued to improve over the past year, but new problems have also emerged.

In areas where the development of labor exchange and mutual aid is relatively late, the number of labor exchange and mutual aid groups has continued to increase, but the number of individual households has also increased. According to a survey of Yao Fort Village in Hulan, from 1949 to 1950, the development of mutual aid groups in the village was as follows: the number of year-round labor exchange groups increased from 3 to 6 (including 2 groups combined with sideline occupations), the number of groups that disbanded after planting the land increased from 2 to 3, and the number of individual households increased from 5 to 7. In 1950, there were 16 year-round labor exchange groups in Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou, accounting for 26.3% of the village's 60 mutual aid groups. In Hejin Village, 37 households were organized in 1948, 35 households in 1949, and 31 households in 1950. More households were organized in 1948, mainly due to coercion in the work. In many areas, the leadership of the mutual aid groups has failed to propose new content based on the new situation, resulting in a widespread phenomenon of laxity.

(IV) Current reflections and demands of the masses regarding agricultural production.

1. The masses' urgent demand now is to expand reproduction. However, there are many problems in the supply of means of production, mainly that the quality of the things supplied is low, the quantity is small, the specifications are poor, and they are not delivered in a timely manner. The masses in Shuanglong Village, Shulan County, reflected: First, the seeds did not arrive until it was almost time for spring plowing, the hoes did not arrive until it was almost time to start hoeing, and the sickles only arrived when the autumn harvest was approaching; Second, the quality is bad. The sickles curl up when they are used to cut, and the shovels curl up when they are stepped on. The batch of carts transported by the county cooperative was deemed to be of poor quality by the masses, and no one wanted them; Third, the specifications are poor. The moldboards transported by the Liangshan Village cooperative during spring plowing could only be used reluctantly because the hand grips were too small and the dog heads were round. The three harrow shanks were too wide and could not be used at all, and are still stored away. None of the 500 hoe blades from the district cooperative could be used; Fourth, the quantity is small. For example, the Liangshan Village cooperative ordered 180 moldboards from the iron factory in the county cooperative during spring plowing, but only 25 were delivered until the spring plowing was about to begin, and there were no more after that, forcing some villagers to go to the market 35 li away to buy them. The masses in Xiaobao Village reflected: the quality of the fertilizer is not good and the price is high, rubber-wheeled carts are too expensive, and there are no medicines for treating tobacco diseases. In addition, there is a general feeling that there is a shortage of wood, making it difficult to build houses and repair farm tools. In the future, the leadership of factories that manufacture means of production and urban handicrafts should be strengthened to improve quality, reduce prices, and ensure timely supply in order to meet the farmers' demand for expanded reproduction. Cooperation and state-owned stores should have a clear division of labor in terms of supply to serve the production needs of the farmers.

2. In terms of agricultural product prices (and the conversion rate of public grain), some prices are low, which affects increased production. For example, for the purchase of tobacco in Xiaobao Village, one jin of tobacco was equivalent to 14 jin of corn in 1947, 6.36 jin in 1948, 6.81 jin in 1949, and 8.93 jin in 1950 (calculated with grade 5 tobacco). As a result, the village only planted three fang [a measure of land] of tobacco in 1948 (one fang of tobacco is approximately equal to 15 to 20 mu), four fang in 1949, and one fang in 1950. Because the state raised the purchase price in 1950, there were six households in West Xiaobao Hamlet alone who wanted to plant it, but they were still worried about whether the price would change again.

The masses in Tuanjie Village reflected: "The specifications for collecting public grain are too high, and we get dizzy from picking out the grain." It got to the point where Lu Shunjin, who was over 60 years old, could not hand over the public grain and had to sell his land. The masses in Yao Fort Village, Hulan, said: "Everything is good now, except for picking out the soybeans." There are many reflections in this regard. The government stipulates that six liang of rice are equivalent to one jin of sorghum, but the masses have to exchange three jin of sorghum for one jin of rice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the methods of collecting public grain.

3. The purchase methods also need to be improved, because the government has little cash available, and the in-kind payments often do not meet the needs of the masses. The Sidao Yanchang Village reflected: "Only 30% of the payment for rice and sorghum is given in cash, and all soybeans are paid for with cloth, which no one can wear." The masses in Xiaobao Village reflected: "The cooperative insists on exchanging japonica rice for white flour. As a result, we have to sell the white flour and buy cloth again." In Bin County, Songjiang, some farmers have surplus grain and can buy horses and carts, but because they cannot turn it all into cash, it is not enough to buy carts and horses, and sometimes purchases are stopped. Farmers in Tuanjie Village complained: "We are told to increase production every day, but no one wants the grain we harvest." The masses in villages with poor transportation do not hesitate to feed the grain to pigs.

4. Tobacco farmers in Xiaobao Village reflected: At present, the government lacks technical guidance for tobacco production. There are only three technical instructors in the entire county, and they only take care of inspection. Now two of them have quit (the county specialty product section has five people, but only one staff member is in charge of tobacco, and he cannot manage it).

5. Other: There is a demand for the establishment of treatment centers for livestock, pigs, and chickens. Farmers in Bin County reflected: There are two chicken plagues every year, and the farmers are unhappy about raising chickens. According to a survey of Fazhan Village, Zhaozhou, the mortality rate of pigs is over 40%, and the mortality rate of chickens is over 60%.

6. Rural lending has become more active, but still cannot meet the needs of the masses. Ten households in West Xiaobao Hamlet sold their oxen, two of which sold their oxen because they did not have enough grain and money for medical treatment. Therefore, in the future, we must actively develop rural lending and guide floating capital in the right direction.

(V) The leadership of districts and villages cannot keep up with the demands of production development.

The new situation requires organizing farmers to expand reproduction, improve agricultural technology, and further improve agricultural production. It also requires specific leadership based on the problems existing in advanced villages, backward villages, and different agricultural seasons. Therefore, this requires district and village leading cadres to improve accordingly. In 1950, many village cadres implemented participation in production to lead production, and the leadership of agricultural production has improved. However, many district and village cadres are still stuck in the old methods of shoveling a few times, making a few trips, applying a few carts of manure, and holding meetings to urge them. Some villages had already applied an average of five carts of manure per mu in 1949, but the district still put forward the slogan of "three carts of manure" in 1950. Some masses joked: "We feel itchy if we don't have a meeting every day." Some district cadres lack the ability to learn agricultural technology and are also poor at absorbing and summarizing the production experience of farmers, which greatly limits the improvement of agricultural production.

　　东北农村经济的新情况
    编者按：这是中共中央东北局政策研究室根据龙江、吉林、松江、辽东四省十个县十六个村屯的一些调查材料所写成的综合报告，可以反映东北老解放区的若干情况。
   （一）农村经济发展颇为迅速，中农已成为农村中的多数
    就东北各地典型村的调查，一九五○年的农业生产量已超过战前的最高产量。如黑龙江白城县的胜利、新发、新立三个村，总产量超过一九四三年的百分之二二；松江呼兰腰堡村超过一九四四年的百分之一八·○九，单位产量绝大部分村屯也都超过了一九四三年的水平。如松江呼兰孤榆村单位产量超过一九四三年百分之六·七五，腰堡村超过百分之一三·一九，又如辽东省凤城县的小堡村、小堡屯，单位产量更超过一九四三年百分之三七·五。
    车马大量增加。白城县胜利、新立两村，一九四三年大车三五台，犁杖八四付，?耙三四张，小农具五六件；一九五○年大车九九台（内胶皮轮大车一台），犁一五二付，?耙四九张，小农具一、四八四件。黑龙江肇州县发展村牲口农具亦有增加，一九四五年车三四台，?耙四九付；一九五○年车六八台，?耙九八张。牲口增加的情况如下：白城县三个村，一九四三年马、骡一五九匹，牛七六头，驴五○头；一九五○年马、骡一二六匹，牛七二头，驴二七八头，从这里可以看出，大牲口虽略有减少，但小牲口（驴）的数目却增加很大。又如凤城县西小堡屯，一九四五年马、骡六匹，牛四○头，驴一六头；一九五○年马、骡一一匹，牛五九头，驴三五头，大小牲口都有增加。
    农民余粮多。吉林榆树解放村五三六户，土地一、二一七·七五垧，一九五○年余粮（除公粮、人畜食用、种籽）为一、○四六、六八○斤，占总产量百分之四七，内有余粮一○○石以上者两家，四○至五○石者一○家，二○石至三○石者二○家，十石左右一七八家，三石至五石二八六家。吉林磐石团结村二二七户，土地四七九·七四垧（水田半垧），余粮五九五、○○○斤，占总产量三分之一以上，平均每户余粮二、六二一斤。黑龙江肇州发展村三三六户，除公粮、人畜食用、籽种、一般生活生产资料的支出外，一九四八年余粮二○八·八石，一九四九年余粮二○二·六石，一九五○年余粮九五七石，余粮户占总户数的百分之五六·六三。吉林永吉搜登站十七户调查共余粮二一、三七六斤，占农业收入的百分之一四·七。松江呼兰腰堡村二一四户，余粮户有一五一户，余粮三八三、二○○斤，占总产量百分之一八；内余粮五○石以上的一户，三○石以上者两户，二○石至二五石者六户，八石至十五石者四户，一石至五石者一○二户。白城三村有八七户有余粮，占总产量百分之二六·六，占总户数的百分之二七。
    购买力随农副业发展亦提高，白城新发村以一九四八年之购买力为百分之一○○，一九四九年为百分之一六八，一九五○年因受旱，降为百分之一四二。辽东清原四道碱场购买力以一九四八年农民购买力为百分之一○○，一九四九年为百分之一七五·二，一九五○年为百分之二○七·四○，这个材料可以代表中等村的情况。
    又如白城三个村，三年来盖新房八六间。其中胜利村打洋井二○个（富裕农户每家都有一个），一九四三年中农平均每人买布一五尺——二○尺，贫农一二尺——一四尺，吃粮（油、盐、肉、面、大米在内），中农一·九石（六○斤一斗），贫农一·七五石；一九五○年中农买布三五尺——五○尺，贫农买布二五尺——三○尺，中农吃粮二·二五石，贫农吃粮二石，农民生活已与战前发生了根本变化。
    生产发展的结果，就是中农成为农村主要阶层，大部上升，小部不动（实际亦有上升），下降者是个别的，这就是今天农村的基本情况。
            各阶层的户数百分比村别  中农（富裕中农在内）  贫农  雇农  新富农  其他合计  户数  ％  户数  ％  户数  ％  户数  ％  户数  ％白城三个村  212（内富3个村中32户）  63.85  109  32.83  5  1.50  6  1.82  332  蛟河荒沟  186  58.00  136  42.00  332磐石团结村  156（内富中15户）70.59  64  28.96  10.45  221凤城西小堡  43（内富中7户）51.20  41  48.80  84舒兰3个村  581（内富中59户）73.10  209  26.40  40.50  794肇州发展村  239（内富中12户）70.52  99  29.19  1  0.29  339
    白城三个村，中农占该三村总户数的百分之六三·八，人口的百分之六七·三，劳力的百分之六九·五，畜力占百分之八七·五，土地占百分之七五·七，大车占百分之八六·四，占总产量百分之七六·八，从这些事实看来，中农在农业生产中，已起了重大作用。
    农村土地买卖和雇佣现象已发生，如黑龙江肇州发展村有六人出卖劳力，其本人成份雇农一、贫农二、中农一、其他二（内三个是因土地少，劳力多，并非家庭经济下降）。吉林舒兰天德全区，一九五○年卖出土地一四·六七垧，雇农出卖土地占百分之七三·二，贫农占百分之一二·三，中农占百分之一五·五。卖地原因很多：（１）有回关里的；（２）缺少生产资料无力耕种的；（３）卖坏地买好地的；（４）转业的。其中一、三、四项出卖土地，是属于土地之重新调整，对生产是有好处的。
    农村经济虽有迅速的发展，但发展是不平衡的，某些村屯户仍有严重的困难，特别是灾区和解放较晚的地区，这种困难更大，因之仍需严重注意扶助这些地区的生产发展。
    （二）平原地区一些上升较快的农民，开始感到再向前发展的道路不宽。
    单纯农业社会主义思想，已基本克服，但还有残余。如吉林舒兰靠山屯群众（包括村人民代表、党员），对生产政策还不够明确，他们说：“雇人是可以的，但可以雇半拉子、小猪倌，不许雇长工；可以单干，但不许用其他条件限制他们；发财是可以的，但不应发大财”。肇州发展村一九五○年有三户想找雇工，六户想单干，但干部不让。该村雷凤岐已买妥一辆胶皮轮大车想单干，因村干批评其“自私自利，不团结”而退回。目前这种现象虽有，但是个别的。目前的基本问题，已不是敢不敢发展的问题，而是某些发展较快的农民，已开始感到发展无门的苦闷。如凤城小堡屯有五户想买胶皮车，因没有人力，又不愿与别人合伙，买不起来；有四户要雇人，又雇不到；还有不少人对改进农业技术兴趣不高，他们认为：“粪已上足了，粮已打够了，到份了”。榆树解放村，每一个劳力平均一九·二二亩地，他们不从深耕细作上多想办法，反认为“近一半劳力感觉‘无啥干’”。肇州发展村农民张如富说：“光种点地不行，非想其他来钱道不可”。宾县民强村公正屯劳动模范王富海说：“你看我除有五·三亩地而外，还有什么发财路呢？”但他们对“一天挣三万五万的副业，又看不上眼”。如辽东凤城西小堡屯，编织草包有销路，大家嫌“来钱慢”。有两个村并开始出现牲口减少情况：解放村因地少，一九五○年由三八四头牲口减为三○○头牲口（一部分是冬卖春买，还可买回些）；西小堡没有增加，但大牲口由一○三头减为九四头，农民反映说：“我们村不能再添牲口了”。
    由于农村工作中对于这些问题未适当解决，因而产生各色各样的自找出路的办法：
    １、有些农民把余粮用到放利上去，如凤城小堡村杨恒春，一九五○年春放出四千多斤粳子，秋得利二千多斤，就够交当年公粮之用。该村老姜头要买猪，艾永金劝阻说：“放粮利大，比你养猪来钱多”。该村姜家堡时玉坤余五、八六二斤粳子，除用于今年农业生产的三、六○○斤外，下余二、二六二斤（占百分之三三·八三），想用作“批青”，他一九五○年五、六月用卖七百斤粳子的钱，买了一、五○○斤粳子（批青），他说：“不干别的啦，光得利我的日子就不离了！”这说明有些人要靠放利发财了。榆树解放村李学增放了一○○多石粮，他说：“用粮放利比种地省心，不费力”。
    ２、投向商业。小堡村中农杨恒春，一九五○年初投一半股份开药铺。一年来他和艾永金，并经常在合作社存款三○○万到五○○万元，准备作投机活动；另有三个党员干部卖了耕牛，亦计划和两个农民开制米所，因钱少没有开起来；另有两户到林口去卖花生。所有这些现象都是该村一九四九年前所没有过的。
    ３、中农制办胶皮车劲大，这是普遍情绪，用以拉脚赚钱。
   （三）一年来换工互助续有提高，但又产生新问题
    在换工互助发展较晚地区，换工互助组续有增加，但单干户也在增加。据呼兰腰堡村的调查，一九四九年至一九五○年该村互助组发展的情况是：常年换工组由三组增至六组（内二组与副业结合），种完地就散者由二组增至三组，单干户由五家增为七家。一九五○年肇州发展村常年换工的共有十六组，占全村六○个互助组的百分之二六·三。何金屯三十八户，一九四八年组织起来的三十七户，一九四九年三十五户，一九五○年三十一户，一九四八年组织起来的多，主要是因为工作上强迫命令。有不少地区对互助组的领导未能根据新的情况提出新的内容，因而产生了很普遍的松懈的现象。
   （四）群众目前有关农业生产的一些反映和要求
    １、群众目前迫切的要求，是扩大再生产。但在生产资料的供给上问题很多，主要的是供给的东西质量低、数量少、规格差、不及时。舒兰县双龙村群众反映：一、已经快到春耕了种籽没到，快开铲了锄头没到，快近秋收了镰刀才来；二、质量坏。镰刀一割就卷刃，铁锹一踩就卷。该县合作社运来一批大车，群众嫌质量坏，谁也没要；三、规格差。亮山村社春耕时运来的铧子，因反手小，狗头圆，只能勉强使用，三个?耙信子头太宽，根本不能用，现在还放着，区社五百块锄板，一块也不能用；四、数量少。如亮山村社，春耕时，在县社铁工厂订了一八○个铧子，直到春耕快开始才运来二十五个，其余再没有了，弄得有的老乡不得不到三十五里地以外的集上去买。小堡村群众反映：肥料质量不好价钱还大，胶皮车太贵，没有治烟病的药。此外，各地普遍感觉缺乏木料，盖房修农具有困难。今后应加强对制造生产资料的工厂和城镇手工业的领导，作到提高质量，降低价格，供应及时，在供给上合作社和国营商店要明确分工，以便满足农民扩大再生产的要求。
    ２、农产品价格（及公粮折合率）方面，有的价格低，影响增产。小堡村烟的收购，一九四七年一斤烟合玉茭十四斤，一九四八年合六·三六斤，一九四九年合六·八一斤，一九五○年合八·九三斤（以五级烟算），因而全村一九四八年只种三房烟（按一房烟约等于十五亩到二十亩烟），一九四九年种四房，一九五○年种一房，而一九五○年由于国家提高了收购价格，仅西小堡屯八十四户就有六家要种的，但仍顾虑价钱到底会不会再变。
    团结村群众反映：“收公粮规格要求高，交公粮挑得头昏眼花。”弄得六十多岁的吕顺金交不出，要卖地。呼兰腰堡村群众说：“现在一切都好，就是挑豆子不好”。这方面反映很多。公家规定六两稻子顶高粱一斤，但群众换一斤稻子就得出三斤高粱，因之急需改进公粮征收办法。
    ３、收购方法还要改进。因为公家现款少，而所付给的实物又往往不适合群众需要。四道碱场村反映：“卖稻子、高粱只给百分之三十现款，大豆全部给布匹，谁也穿不了”。小堡村群众反映：“合作社拉去粳子非给白面换不可。结果还得卖了白面再去买布”。松江宾县有的农民有余粮，可以买马添车，但因不能尽数变成现金，不够添车买马之用，并有时停购。团结村农民埋怨：“天天叫增产，打了粮食没人要”。交通闭塞的乡村群众，则不惜用粮喂猪。
    ４、小堡村烟户反映：目前公家对种烟生产缺乏技术指导，全县有三个技术指导员，只管检收，现在其中已有两个人不干，只剩一人了（县特产科五人，只一干事管烟，也管不了）。
    ５、其他：要求建立耕畜猪鸡治疗所，宾县农民反映：每年要有两次鸡瘟，农民感到养的不高兴。据肇州发展村调查，猪死亡率百分之四○以上，鸡的死亡率百分之六○以上。
    ６、农村借贷已比较活跃，但仍不能适应群众需要，西小堡屯有十户卖牛，其中有两户卖牛是因为粮食不够和没有钱治病。因此今后要积极发展农村借贷工作，引导游资向正确方向发展。
   （五）区村领导赶不上生产发展的要求
    新的情况，要求组织农民扩大再生产，提高农业技术，把农业生产再提高一步。并要求分别先进村、落后村及不同农业季节所存在的问题进行具体领导。因此这就需要区村领导干部跟着提高一步。一九五○年很多村屯干部实行参加生产领导生产，对农业生产的领导已有改进。但仍有不少区村干部，还是停留在几铲、几趟、几车粪及开会督促的老办法上。有的村一九四九年已平均每亩上到五车粪，一九五○年区上仍旧是提出“三车粪”的口号，有的群众说风凉话：“我们一天不开会身上都觉着刺痒”。有些区干部对农业技术的学习差，对吸收与总结农民的生产经验亦差，因之使农业生产的提高受到很大限制。
