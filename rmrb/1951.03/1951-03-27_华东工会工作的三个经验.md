The East China Trade Union Work Conference held from December last year to January this year, initially summarized the experience of trade union work in East China. The basic experience of trade union work in East China is that workers' welfare undertakings, cultural and educational work, and the establishment of trade union work systems can only be well developed on the basis of carrying out production movements.

Here, the first is how to face the issue of production. For example, when the Nanjing Power Plant was given the production task of overhauling Boiler No. 4 and Generator No. 3, the trade union relied on the workers to launch a series of production campaigns. From the leadership level, it went deep into the workshops to discover and cultivate two old workers with technology as the backbone, and promoted a team to take on the main work of the overhaul. The trade union divided the administrative general production plan into five small plans, broke through from one group, encouraged and promoted all the workers in the plant to make plans. The trade union also established collective contracts with the administration on the basis of mobilizing each group and each worker to make their own plans. In this way, the workers had both the goal of completing the task and a clear responsibility. The trade union's organization, cultural education, and labor protection committees were also able to formulate specific plans centered on production to ensure the completion of the production tasks. For example, the organizational work was to reorganize the groups according to production principles and reasonably adjust the labor force. Cultural work was to establish communication groups in each workshop to report daily production conditions and to commend advantages and criticize shortcomings. The Labor Protection Committee proposed caring for workers' health, preventing illness, keeping medicines and medicine boxes in the workshops, and suggesting that the administration find ways to improve dangerous places. In this way, under the leadership of the trade union, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers was relied upon and brought into play, and the task of overhauling Boiler No. 4 was completed ahead of schedule. Another example is the Changzhou Dacheng Yarn Factory. Before the production competition, the trade union was only engaged in welfare, and labor discipline was very poor, resulting in the burning of machines and the return of 23 pieces of yarn and 43 pieces of cloth by the Shanghai Wuhe Manufacturing Factory. These phenomena attracted the attention of the broad masses of workers. The trade union seized these incidents, educated the broad masses of workers, rectified labor discipline, established workshop committees, adjusted the groups, promoted the capital to formulate production plans, and partially adjusted unreasonable wages. Therefore, the factory gradually eliminated various obstacles in production, improved productivity, and increased cotton yarn production by 72 pieces in September last year, and the rate of return flowers and secondary cloth also decreased significantly. Another example is the trade union of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory of the East China Textile Administration Bureau. It also solved the urgent welfare problems of workers' daily life such as dining halls and bathrooms while rectifying labor discipline, thus changing the workers' labor attitude, and the production volume in 20 hours reached 1.28 pounds (20-hour output per spindle of 20 counts yarn) or more, exceeding the task by more than 25 percent. An important experience of trade union work in East China is that trade union work can only be done well if it focuses on leading production movements. Only by addressing the actual problems existing in the factory that hinder production progress, solving problems that are closely related to production and are urgently needed and possible to solve by the broad masses of workers, can we promote workers' enthusiasm for production, establish the idea of trade union work facing production, and further mobilize and organize workers to formulate production plans and establish various systems so that the production movement can be sustained and consolidated on the basis of the continuous improvement of workers' political consciousness.

The second experience of trade union work in East China is that in order to give play to the role of trade unions in leading production and to improve the organization of trade unions, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the production competition movement under the unified leadership of the Party, starting from the existing production conditions and foundation of various regions and factories, emphasizing the combination of labor and technology, emphasizing the mastery of technology and the division of labor, emphasizing organized labor and collaborative labor. Otherwise, the production competition movement will not be sustainable and will become a temporary phenomenon. Trade unions should enrich the content of trade union work and improve the organization of trade unions from leading production movements, overcome the phenomena of closed-doorism and paternalism existing in trade union work, and widely absorb worker leaders who have influence among the workers to participate in trade union work. In the past, many trade unions in East China only paid attention to absorbing small workers, coolies, and temporary workers who lived in relative hardship, relying on outside cadres with no production experience to take over the trade union, and did not pay attention to absorbing experienced old workers and skilled workers to participate in the leadership of trade union work, so that production was not done well. Organizationally, we should strengthen the leadership of grass-roots trade union work, give play to the role of workshop committees and groups, cherish and care for labor models, and strive to cultivate a large number of activists in production as the backbone for leading production and leading trade union work. At the same time, in terms of leadership methods, we must be good at grasping key points to create typical examples, and we must be good at promoting the progress of the entire factory and the entire industry with the specific facts and experiences of model workshops, model production teams, and model workers.

The third experience is that the steps of the Chinese Communist Party factory branch, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League should be consistent. In the past, workers in various parts of East China generally reflected that the shortcomings of trade union work were "five more and one less," that is: more meetings, more tasks, more plans, more forms, more clues, and fewer methods. The basic reason is that in the past, trade union work was divorced from the central task of production, and the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League each did their own thing. In the future, in order to overcome the problem of few methods in trade union work, we must grasp the leadership of production as the center, and carry out trade union work on the basis of developing the production movement. In order to overcome the phenomenon of chaotic clues, the Party branch should guarantee the implementation of all production requirements proposed by the higher level, but all production requirements must first be brought to the branch for discussion. After all higher-level production requirements have been discussed by the branch and specific plans have been formulated, the Party members in the trade union should submit the plans to the trade union for discussion and approval, and then call on the workers to discuss and implement them. In this way, the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League in the factory can clarify their respective responsibilities and give play to the role of mutual cooperation and mutual assistance, so as to achieve consistency between the Party and the government, consistency between the Party and the masses, and consistency between the top and the bottom.

    华东工会工作的三个经验
    去年十二月到今年一月举行的华东工会工作会议，初步总结了华东各地工会工作的经验。华东工会工作的基本经验是只有在开展生产运动的基础上才能很好地展开工人福利事业、文化教育工作及建立工会工作制度等。
    这里，首先是如何面向生产问题。如南京发电厂在大修四号锅炉与三号发电机的生产任务下，工会依靠工人展开了一系列的生产运动，从领导上深入车间发现与培养了两个有技术的老工人为骨干，推动了一个小组来担负起大修的主要工作。工会把行政上总的生产计划分成五个小计划，从一个小组突破、鼓励与推动了全厂的工人订计划。工会又从发动每个小组每个工人自己订计划的基础上和行政上订立了集体合同，这样使工人群众既有了完成任务的目标，又有了明确的职责。工会的组织、文化教育、劳动保护等工作委员会也都能环绕着生产为中心订立具体的计划，保证生产任务的完成。如组织工作是根据生产原则重新整编小组，合理调整劳动力。文化工作为建立各车间通讯小组、报道每日生产情况，并进行表扬优点批评缺点。劳动保护工作委员会曾提出了关心工人健康，防止生病，车间内常备药品药箱，有危险的地方建议行政设法改进等。这样在工会的领导下依靠和发挥了广大工人的劳动热情，提前完成了大修四号锅炉工程的任务。再如常州大成纱厂，该厂在生产竞赛前，因为工会单纯搞福利，劳动纪律很坏，以致发生烧坏机器，以及被上海五和制造厂退回二十三支纱四十三件等现象。这些现象引起了广大工人的注意。工会就抓住了这些事件，对广大工人进行了教育，整顿了劳动纪律，建立了车间委员会，调整了小组，推动资方订立生产计划，并局部调整了不合理的工资。因此，该厂逐渐扫除了生产上各种障碍，提高了生产率，去年九月份即增产棉纱七十二件，回花与次布率亦有显著的减少。再如华东纺织管理局国营上海第二棉纺织厂工会也是从整顿劳动纪律的工作中同时解决了饭厅、浴室等工人日常的迫切的福利问题，因而转变了工人群众的劳动态度，二十小时的生产量达到一点二八磅（二十小时二十支纱每锭产量）以上，超过任务百分之二十五以上。华东各地工会工作一条重要的经验，就是只有工会工作以领导生产运动为中心，工会工作才能做好。针对工厂中存在着的阻碍生产前进的实际问题，解决与生产密切相关连而又为广大工人群众迫切需要而又可能解决的问题，才能发扬工人对生产的积极性，树立工会工作面向生产的思想，并进一步动员与组织工人订生产计划，建立各种制度，使生产运动在工人政治觉悟不断提高的基础上持久巩固下去。
    华东工会工作第二个经验是要发挥工会领导生产的作用和健全工会的组织，必须在党的统一领导下全面地掌握生产竞赛运动，从各地各厂现有生产条件和基础出发，强调劳动与技术结合，强调掌握技术和技术分工，强调有组织的劳动和协同的劳动，否则生产竞赛运动即不能持久，成为突击一时的现象。工会要从领导生产运动中来充实工会工作内容和健全工会组织，克服工会工作中所存在的关门主义与包办代替的现象，广泛地吸收各方面在工人群众中有影响的工人领袖参加工会的工作。过去华东许多工会只注意吸收生活较苦的小工、苦力、临时工，依靠无生产经验的外来干部包办工会，而不注意吸收对生产有经验的老工人及技术熟练工人参加工会领导工作，以致生产搞不好。在组织上应加强对基层工会工作的领导，发挥车间委员会和小组的作用，爱护和关心劳动模范，努力培养大批生产中的积极分子作为领导生产和领导工会工作的骨干。同时在领导方法上要善于抓住重点创造典型，要善于以模范车间、模范生产小组、模范工作人物的具体事实和经验推动全厂全产业前进。
    第三个经验是中国共产党工厂支部、行政、工会、青年团四方面的步调要一致。过去华东各地工人普遍反映工会工作的缺点为五多一少，即：会议多、任务多、计划多、表格多、头绪多和办法少。其基本原因在于过去工会工作脱离生产中心任务及党、行政、工会、青年团各搞一套。今后要克服工会工作中办法少的毛病，就要掌握以领导生产为中心，并从发展生产运动基础上开展工会工作。要克服头绪混乱的现象，凡上级所提出的生产要求，党的支部均应保证执行，但一切生产要求必须首先提到支部讨论，一切上级生产要求经过支部讨论订立具体计划后，即由工会中的党员，将该项计划，提交工会讨论，通过后，然后号召工人讨论执行，这样，便可使厂内党、行政、工会、青年团明确各自职责，发挥相互配合相互帮助的作用，作到党政一致，党群一致，上下一致。
