　　Cadres and Masses Meeting Together
    Xu Yunbei, Member of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Xiuwen County, Guizhou Province, has provided experience in holding meetings together for cadres and peasants in newly liberated areas. Many county branches have also held such meetings. Facts have proven that it is extremely successful to convene a county-wide cadre meeting, with the participation of two to three hundred peasants (good farm association members, farmers, and some village cadres; not necessarily all the peasant representatives who attended previous meetings), to jointly review grain requisition, and to arrange for the next stage of eliminating bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and refunding deposits.
    In such meetings, the first step is to summarize past work and arrange future work. In the process of summarizing and arranging work, not only are the guidelines and policies resolved and the cadres' thinking improved, but also the issue of combining them with the specific circumstances of the time and place is addressed. Because of the participation of peasants, they offer simple and objective opinions on what aspects of the past work were done correctly and what aspects were done incorrectly. This makes up for the leadership's lack of understanding of the situation below and the cadres' one-sidedness—exaggeration and minimization. The peasants attending the meeting provide many situations that our cadres are usually unaware of, which greatly helps the leadership understand the situation. Similarly, in arranging future work, the peasants attending the meeting offer opinions based on their understanding of the situation, making the guidelines and policies more concrete. In carrying out the movement to eliminate bandits and oppose local bullies, they pointed out which bandit leaders have not yet been arrested, which scattered bandits have not yet been eliminated, and how many guns have not been recovered. This enriches the content of eliminating bandits and opposing local bullies, rather than just talking about the importance of eliminating bandits and opposing local bullies in general terms. It also overcomes the lack of political awareness and complacency of some cadres. For example, some comrades believed that there was nothing more to do in areas that had already eliminated bandits, but after the peasants explained with concrete facts, they became sober and realized the importance of eliminating bandits and opposing local bullies.
    Secondly, through such meetings, the relationship between the leadership and the masses is improved, and the cadres' class stance and mass line are greatly enhanced. Among the cadres working in rural areas now, there are veteran cadres, new cadres, and old staff members. After this period of work, facts have proven that although most comrades lack experience, the vast majority can work actively and enthusiastically in mobilizing the masses, carrying out the elimination of bandits and opposition to landlords, fighting against the landlord class, and completing grain requisition, climbing mountains and enduring rain, day and night, with a firm stand, resolutely serving the peasants, uniting the masses, starting from the demands of the masses, and creating many vivid deeds. However, there are also many comrades who seek pleasure and fear hardship, act arbitrarily and stubbornly, and even use the fruits of the masses and violate mass discipline. Some even serve the landlords instead of the peasants, caring about the landlords but not caring about the peasants; some beat and scold the masses and suppress the mass movement. This shows that currently, not only is the mass队伍 impure, but complex problems also exist among the cadres. If these problems are not resolved, it will be impossible to implement the anti-feudal struggle. In the meeting, cadres and peasants jointly used concrete facts to prove which cadres have a firm stand, truly serve the people, are good at uniting the masses, and are praised by the masses; they also exposed the facts of ambiguous standpoints and detachment from the masses. Those comrades who were exposed recognized their mistakes and asked to correct them, which made all comrades ideologically aware and brightened their eyes. This further improved the relationship between the leadership, cadres, and masses, so as to achieve the so-called "three-layer brightening." Solving the cadres' class stance and mass line, all localities have achieved success in the August Party Representative Meeting and rectification, thus pushing the work forward. Now, with the progress of the work and the unfolding of the next stage of work, continuing to solve this problem in depth, so that the cadres' class stance and mass line can be further resolved, is of great significance to the anti-feudal struggle in the future.
    In addition, it also educated the peasants who attended the meeting. At the beginning, they did not understand our purpose and did not know why such a meeting was to be held. In the process of the meeting, they were greatly educated, so that they learned to carry out criticism and self-criticism, learned democracy, and improved their work. After the peasants who attended the meeting brought the spirit of the meeting back to the villages, the village cadres and activists learned to unite the masses, review their work, and establish a democratic style in the countryside; mobilize the masses to summarize and review their work, and launch mass criticism and self-criticism.
    Such a meeting is a meeting for the leadership to review and arrange work, a meeting for the masses to discuss work, a meeting for cadres to carry out rectification, and a meeting for training peasant activists. In order to hold this meeting well and not deviate, the following three links must be firmly grasped:
    1. From summarizing work to arranging work, the meeting should always proceed from work and return to work, not "the masses rectify the cadres," nor "the leadership trains the activists," but the leadership, cadres, and masses jointly summarize the work. The meeting must be linked to the cadres' strengths and weaknesses, which starts from reviewing the work, not putting on hats first and then looking for materials. The meeting must distinguish between right and wrong, which is the result of summarizing the work, not just rectifying the cadres. To make the comrades who have made mistakes feel sad after recognizing their mistakes from reviewing the work, and to point out the path and opportunity for correction in studying future work, so that he will feel happy and active. This is what the Party Representative Meeting pointed out that the rectification of cadres must be combined with work.
    2. The meeting must affirm achievements and criticize shortcomings, and carry out criticism and self-criticism seriously. At the beginning, the peasants attending the meeting did not dare to express their opinions, especially not dare to criticize the cadres' shortcomings, only talking about how good the cadres were, how backward the masses were, and how the masses did not understand the policies. When the leading cadres seriously reviewed their work and exposed their shortcomings in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, they boldly and sincerely criticized some cadres for being "very concerned about the landlords" and "not concerned about the peasants." After the shortcomings were exposed, some comrades believed that with so many shortcomings, they would not be able to lead the peasants after returning. In the typical reports, many model deeds of mobilizing the masses also established an atmosphere for the future anti-feudal struggle, and these concerns were also dispelled. Affirming achievements, criticizing shortcomings, and serious criticism and self-criticism are important keys to whether the meeting is successful or not.
    3. The meeting must be closely integrated with the masses and implement the mass line. Such a meeting is jointly held by leading comrades, working cadres, and peasants attending the meeting. Some comrades believe that the peasants at this meeting are "guests" and "teachers" who are invited, which is wrong. Because the work being discussed is rural work, which is their own business, and the issue of cadres' thinking and style is also related to them, so they are not guests when they attend the meeting, but also masters. Leading comrades, working cadres, and peasants attending the meeting are combined into a whole, analyzing and understanding the principles, policies, work situation, cadre situation, and mass situation together without any barriers, so the meeting must always pay attention to the peasants' thinking and listen to their opinions, and let the cadres and peasants attending the meeting jointly come up with ideas and methods based on the principles and policies, so that the principles and policies are truly combined with the masses. Only in this way can the meeting be held well, and can the current policy of eliminating bandits and opposing local bullies be quickly implemented into a mass movement; only in this way can the cadres' class consciousness and mass line be further resolved under the supervision of the masses.
    This kind of meeting is successful, and is one of the leadership methods that combines the leadership with the masses and implements the mass line, so that we can truly "consult with the masses in everything" and give full play to the power of the masses.

### 干部群众一起开会

　　干部群众一起开会
    中共贵州省委会委员  徐运北
    贵州修文县提供了新解放区干部和农民一起开会的经验，不少的县分也开了这样的会。事实证明，在总结征粮，布置下一阶段的清匪、反霸、减租、退押，召开全县干部会议，并吸收二三百农民参加（成份好的农会会员、农民和一部分村干部；过去历次开会的农民代表不一定都参加），一起检查工作、布置工作是极为成功的。
    在这样的会议上，首先是总结了过去的工作，布置了今后的工作。在总结和布置工作中，不仅是解决了方针政策与提高了干部思想，同时解决了与当时当地具体情况相结合的问题。因为有农民参加，他们朴素地、客观地对过去的工作那些地方作的对、那些地方作的不对提出了意见，这就补足了领导上对下面情况不了解与干部中的片面性——夸大与缩小。到会农民提供出许多情况，是我们干部平时都不了解的，就大大帮助了领导上了解情况。在布置今后工作中，同样地，到会的农民从自己所了解的情况提出意见，使方针政策具体化。开展清匪、反霸运动，他们指出了有那些匪首尚未逮捕，有那些散匪尚未肃清，还有多少枪支未搞出来，这样就使清匪、反霸的内容丰富起来，而不是泛泛地讲清匪反霸的重要。同时也克服了某些干部的政治觉悟不高与麻痹思想。如有的同志认为已经肃清土匪的地区，似乎已经无事可作，但经过农民以具体事实说明后，才清醒过来，认识到清匪、反霸的重要。
    其次是经过这样的会议，使领导与群众的关系得到改善，干部在阶级立场与群众路线上得到大大提高。现在农村工作的干部，有老干部、新干部、旧职员，他们经过这一段工作，事实证明，绝大多数同志虽然经验不足，但是在发动群众、进行清匪、反霸和地主阶级进行斗争以及完成征粮中，绝大多数都能积极热忱地工作，爬山淋雨，日以继夜，立场坚定，坚决为农民办事，团结群众从群众的要求出发，创造了许多生动的事迹。可是也有不少的同志图享乐怕吃苦，强迫命令一意孤行；有的动用群众果实，违犯群众纪律，甚至有的不是给农民办事而是给地主办事，关心地主而不关心农民；有的打骂群众，镇压群众运动。这就说明了目前不仅是群众队伍不纯，在干部中间同样存在复杂问题。这些问题不解决，不可能贯彻反封建斗争。在会议中经过干部和农民一起，以具体事实证明了那些干部立场坚定、真正为人民服务、善于团结群众、为群众所赞许；同样也揭发了立场模糊以及脱离群众的事实。被揭发的这些同志认识到自己的错误而要求改正，使全体同志思想觉悟起来和眼睛亮起来，这就使领导、干部、群众中间的关系得到进一步的改善，所谓达到“三层亮”。解决干部的阶级立场与群众路线，在八月党代表会议以及整风中，各地都取得了成绩，因而使工作向前推进一步。现在随着工作的进展，随着下一段工作的展开，继续深入地解决这一问题，使干部阶级立场和群众路线得到进一步的解决，对今后反封建斗争是有重大意义的。
    另外也教育了到会的农民。开始时，他们不了解我们的目的，不知为啥要开这样的会。在开会的过程中，大大教育了他们，使他们学会开展批评与自我批评，学会民主、改进工作。经过到会农民将会议的精神带回村子里去，使村干部、积极分子学会团结群众，检讨工作，在农村中树立民主作风；发动群众总结检查工作，展开群众性的批评与自我批评。
    这样的会是领导上检查布置工作的会议，又是群众讨论工作的会议，是干部进行整风的会议，又是培养农民积极分子的会议。为了开好这种会议与不出偏向，必须紧紧掌握以下三个环节：
    一、从总结工作到布置工作，会议的进行始终是从工作中来又回到工作中去，不是“群众整干部”，也不是“领导培养积极分子”，而是领导、干部、群众共同总结工作。会议中一定要联系到干部的优缺点，这是先从检查工作出发，而不是先戴帽子后找材料。会议中一定分清是非，这是总结工作的结果，而不是单独进行整干部。要使犯错误的同志从检查工作中认识到自己的错误而感到难过，在研究今后工作中给他指出改正的道路和机会，这样，他便会感到愉快而积极。这就是党代表会议所指出的整顿干部必须结合工作。
    二、会议的进行必须肯定成绩批判缺点，认真地开展批评和自我批评。开始时，到会农民不敢发表意见，尤其不敢批评干部缺点，只讲干部好、群众落后、群众不懂政策。当领导干部认真地以批评与自我批评的精神检查工作、暴露缺点，他们才大胆而真诚地批评某些干部“对地主很关心”，“对农民不关心”。当缺点暴露之后，又有的同志认为这样多的缺点，回去后无法领导农民了，在典型报告中许多发动群众的模范事迹，又树立起今后反封建斗争的空气，这些顾虑也打消了。肯定成绩、批判缺点、认真地批评与自我批评是会议开好与否的重要关键。
    三、会议进行必须紧紧和群众结合在一起，贯彻群众路线。这样的会议是领导同志、工作干部、到会农民一起开的。有的同志认为农民在这个会议上是“客人”、是请来的“老师”，这种看法是不对的。因为讨论的工作是农村工作，正是他们自己的事情，干部思想作风问题也正是与他们联系的，因而他们来参加会议，并不是客人而同样是主人。领导同志、工作干部、到会农民结合成一个整体，毫无隔阂地将方针、政策、工作情况、干部情况、群众情况，大家来共同分析共同认识，因而会议的进行必须时时注意到农民的思想情况与倾听他们的意见，让到会的干部和农民根据方针政策共同出主意想办法，而使方针政策真正和群众结合起来。只有这样才能使会议开的好，才能使目前的清匪、反霸这一方针迅速贯彻成为群众的运动；只有这样，才能在群众监督下，进一步解决干部的阶级觉悟与群众路线。
    这种会议是成功的，是领导与群众结合、贯彻群众路线的领导方式之一，这样，真正做到“遇事和群众商量”，充分发挥群众的力量。
