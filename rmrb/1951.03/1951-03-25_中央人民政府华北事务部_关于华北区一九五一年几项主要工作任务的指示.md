　　Instructions from the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government on Several Major Tasks for the North China Region in 1951

    Based on the current situation, the Central People's Government's instructions on national tasks, and the basic conditions of the North China region, governments at all levels in North China should strive to complete the following major tasks in 1951 to further lay the foundation for large-scale economic construction in the future.

    First, continue to deepen the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism's conspiracy to rearm Japan and undermine world peace. Strengthen the work of supporting the front lines of the Korean War, thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialist cultural aggression, systematically eliminate all American imperialist cultural strongholds in China, and raise the level of patriotism and anti-American imperialism among the broad masses of the people. This is the current and long-term central political task. Governments at all levels must fully emphasize the leadership of this movement, so that it penetrates into small towns and the vast countryside; special attention must be paid to making concrete plans to implement this movement in all practical work, so that everyone is educated in resisting America and aiding Korea, in order to promote the development of various tasks.

    Second, further restore and develop industrial and agricultural production in North China.

    (1) In terms of industrial production: We should guarantee and supervise the completion of plans for state-owned industries, especially defense industries and transportation. At the same time, adjust and enrich existing provincial-run factories and mines, and give full play to the effectiveness of existing machinery to meet the needs of state-owned industrial production, and focus on restoring and developing small-scale civilian machinery manufacturing, and manufacturing plants for agricultural tools, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., as well as processing factories, to meet the needs of agricultural production. Local industries operated by special districts and county governments should also be rectified and gradually developed to fully meet the needs of local agricultural production and farmers' lives. Private industries and handicrafts should be actively supported and guided by improving business management, organizing joint operations, processing orders, and appropriately resolving their raw material and technical difficulties, so that they can be profitable and develop in a way that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In addition, we should pay attention to protecting mines and prohibit random mining. The operation of existing earthen kilns (small mines) should be improved, and gradually adopt the method of merging small kilns to implement joint operations, so that their operations tend to be rationalized.

    Governments at all levels should strengthen leadership over cities and clarify the view of serving industrial production and the masses of workers in urban construction. Strengthen factory management, overcome the phenomena of large waste, high costs, and low quality caused by poor management, and do a good job in industrial surveys to overcome blindness. To do this, it is necessary to implement the policy of relying on the working class and uniting technical personnel. Establish and improve factory management committees to achieve democratic management. Unreasonable wages should be appropriately adjusted step by step. Improve production safety equipment and sanitation equipment, implement labor insurance, and gradually improve workers' living and working conditions on the basis of increasing production. All remaining or disguised feudal foreman systems must be completely eliminated within this year. Launch anti-American and patriotic production emulation campaigns and rationalization proposal campaigns in all public and private factories and mines to inspire workers' production enthusiasm, improve labor organization, and improve production technology; reward inventions and technological improvements, cultivate labor models, and promote production to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. Gradually implement economic accounting systems, and implement quota management with the approval of higher authorities when conditions permit, and correct all waste phenomena caused by unplanned work and finance. Advocate domestic goods and accumulate funds. Strengthen economic security work. Factory management personnel should further familiarize themselves with and learn production knowledge and technology.

    The entire region should conscientiously implement the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China.

    (2) In terms of agricultural production: Strive for a bumper harvest this year. Increase production by 10% on the existing basis, and completely restore agricultural production in the entire region to pre-war levels. The entire region should plant 22.5 million mu of cotton, and strive for an average yield of 30 jin of ginned cotton per mu. And increase the planting of economic crops such as tobacco and hemp.

    In order to achieve the above requirements, special attention must be paid to: (1) Implementing the policy of combining mutual aid teams with agricultural technology, sideline production, and supply and marketing cooperatives. Reward and treat mutual aid teams favorably. In old areas with a foundation, enrich the content of mutual aid teams, give full play to collective strength, cultivate intensively and meticulously, develop water conservancy, improve existing agricultural tools and purchase new agricultural tools, and improve cultivation techniques to improve productivity. For some advanced methods in mutual aid teams created by the masses, such as accumulating public funds (righteous granaries) and public property, the leadership should pay attention to experimentation and summarization, and cautiously and appropriately promote them according to the degree of acceptance by farmers and various conditions. In areas where the foundation of mutual aid teams is weak, they should be developed and improved in a planned manner. (2) Governments at all levels should always attach importance to disaster prevention and relief work, continue to inspire the idea of "man will conquer nature," implement the principle of "prevention is more important than cure," and actively organize and lead the masses to carry out activities such as drought and flood prevention, seed soaking and mixing, insect and egg catching, weeding, and prevention of livestock epidemics, and summarize and disseminate the masses' inherent experience in preventing and controlling various disasters. Encourage the use of new medicines and machinery to reduce and even eliminate pests and diseases. (3) Actively build water conservancy projects, carry out soil and water conservation work, and improve farmland water conservancy management. (4) Develop rural credit undertakings, promote savings, reward production investment, and help farmers solve difficulties such as livestock, agricultural tools, and fertilizers. (5) Correctly implement the agricultural tax policy of assessing taxes according to rates, democratic assessment, and fixed burdens, and use slack seasons to carry out pilot projects of assessment and quota setting in a planned and focused manner, and strive to fully achieve fixed burdens within the next two years. (6) Implement reward production policies. Timely reward various inventions, creations, and labor models; convene labor model conferences and production exhibitions in a timely manner, give full play to the role of labor models, promote their experience, and drive mass production. (7) Reward the planting of industrial raw material crops, adhere to reasonable parity prices for cotton and grain, tobacco and grain, and hemp and grain, and conscientiously solve the difficulties of coal, grain, fodder, and fertilizer shortages in cotton-producing areas, and do everything possible to guarantee the interests of farmers in special product areas. (8) Rural work cadres should gradually learn agricultural production techniques, unite farmers with technical experience and agricultural technicians; and develop rural cultural and educational work. (9) Pay special attention to solving the production and life difficulties of poor martyrs', soldiers', and staff members' families, as well as the masses in remote mountainous areas and old revolutionary base areas in various provinces.

    In order to guarantee the development of the above-mentioned industrial and agricultural production, governments at all levels should carry out urban and rural health work, further unite Chinese and Western medicine, effectively prevent epidemics, and pay attention to health publicity and education work.

    Third, strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and develop trade and cooperative work.

    Developing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and enlivening trade to stimulate the development of industrial and agricultural production is an important link in doing a good job in economic construction. Governments at all levels should attach importance to commercial work. Under the leadership of state-owned commerce, vigorously develop cooperative commerce, correctly guide private commerce, and organize all mass commercial forces. Through contract systems, joint operations, and other methods, the economies of cooperatives, private businesses, and independent small producers should be closely integrated with state-owned commerce. At the same time, state-owned commerce should continue to improve its management methods, correctly grasp price policies, and pay attention to the correct coordination of national and regional prices, market prices and listed prices, and currency issuance and withdrawal. Master the parity between various commodities and regional differences in order to maintain and consolidate price stability. Expand the operation of local products, implement the processing of local products and ensure specifications; organize inland sales, and set up a package of local product companies in remote areas, and at the same time make full use of bazaars, temple fairs, etc., vigorously open up the domestic market, and supply the necessities of production and life for the masses; the sale of goods must pay attention to the season and be timely and suitable for the masses, and ensure the completion of the task of remitting commercial profits. Encourage private merchants to operate local products; restore and establish commercial networks, adjust transportation, develop river transportation, repair roads, organize mass transportation, and increase the planning of transportation.

    For cooperatives, it is necessary to implement the principle of serving members and upper-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, rectify and develop cooperatives in various places, and establish democratic life and special responsibility systems within the cooperatives. In terms of business, we should continue to strengthen supply and marketing businesses, vigorously promote agricultural and sideline products in rural areas, and supply members with production and living materials; in cities, we should strengthen consumer supply for members. End all retail departments that are divorced from lower-level cooperatives, and replace them with wholesale departments, processing factories, or cooperative warehouses that serve lower-level cooperatives. Focus on promoting fixed quota, fixed price, and fixed time rationing systems. Actively develop rural credit cooperative undertakings and carry out rural credit loans. Conduct pilot projects for agricultural production cooperatives and urban handicraft production cooperatives where conditions permit. Widely develop contract businesses such as pre-purchase, ordering, and credit purchase to enhance business planning and enable the cooperative economy to play a greater role in the entire economic construction.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of financial and economic work, it is necessary to establish and improve the financial and economic committees of provinces (cities) and special districts, and establish financial and economic offices in counties, which are responsible for planning and inspecting the financial and economic work in their respective jurisdictions, and actively attach importance to the investigation and research of financial and economic data.

    Fourth, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Each province (city) should strengthen the unified leadership of its subordinate political and legal departments and achieve close coordination. The first priority is to strengthen public security and judicial work, strengthen the people's anti-espionage work, severely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, eliminate special agents, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits in a few areas, eliminate the I-Kuan-Tao, and severely punish reactionary lawless landlords. Attach importance to local armed forces and militia construction to protect various economic productions. To this end, we must continue to overcome the complacency and underestimation of the enemy that exists in some cadres, thoroughly correct the ideological bias of "unbounded leniency" towards counter-revolutionaries, correctly implement the policy of combining suppression and leniency, and conscientiously implement the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries promulgated by the Central People's Government. Resolute counter-revolutionaries must be severely suppressed, while those who should be lenient should be given leniency; it is necessary to cooperate with the development of the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and anti-American patriotism, fully mobilize the mass anti-espionage movement, and lead the masses to learn this method of dealing with the counter-revolutionary class in order to more effectively eliminate all sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and ensure the smooth progress of production and construction.

    Another important aspect of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship is that we must conscientiously unite people from all walks of life, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and further improve the people's representative conferences at all levels; continue to correct the formalism and lack of attention to this in some places. In the future, all meetings that must be convened according to the regulations should be convened in a timely manner. Anything that falls within the scope of the powers of the people's representative conference must be handled in accordance with the regulations, so that the people's democratic life is more enriched and expanded. The people's governments of each province (city) should systematically summarize the experience of urban political power construction, strengthen the leadership of urban political power construction, and publicize and discuss Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing on February 28 in various gatherings, newspapers, and periodicals. Each region should selectively absorb experience in the people's representative conferences of districts and villages in order to promote them; and gradually rectify the work of village political power to adapt to the needs of the current tasks.

    Fifth, train and cultivate cadres. This is a serious task in preparing for large-scale economic construction. The personnel work of the people's governments of each province (city) must be established quickly and manage cadres in a unified manner. Systematically and step-by-step train district and village cadres to improve their ideological and policy levels and their ability to handle affairs, and continue to improve the work style of cadres. And pay attention to the cultivation of various specialized cadres. Strengthen the supervision and inspection of theoretical and cultural learning for cadres in service, and strive to eliminate illiteracy among cadres above the district level within the next year or two. At the same time, pay attention to the leadership of other cultural and educational work, especially the development of education for workers and peasants; run schools at all levels well and pay attention to students' study life and health conditions to seek appropriate adjustments, so that school education is more adapted to the needs of the country's long-term construction.

    为达到上述要求，必须特别注意：（一）贯彻互助组和农业技术、副业生产、供销合作社相结合的方针。奖励和优待互助组。在老区有基础的地方，充实互助组内容，发挥集体力量，精耕细作，开发水利，改良现有农具和购买新式农具，改进耕作技术，以提高生产力。对于群众所创造的互助组中的若干先进办法，如积累公积金（义仓）及公共财产等，领导上应注意实验和总结，并按农民接受程度及各种条件谨慎地适当地推广。互助组基础薄弱的地区，则要有计划地去发展和改进。（二）各级人民政府应将防灾、救灾工作经常重视起来，继续启发“人定胜天”的思想，贯彻“防重于治”的方针，积极组织领导群众进行防旱防涝、浸种拌种、捕虫挖卵、除杂草、防畜瘟等项运动，总结和传布群众固有的防治各种灾害的经验。提倡使用新药械，做到减少以至消灭病虫害。（三）积极兴修水利，进行水土保持工作，改进农田水利管理。（四）开展农村信贷事业，提倡储蓄，奖励生产投资，扶助农民解决牲畜、农具、肥料等困难。（五）正确执行依率计征、民主评定、固定负担的农业税收政策，利用农闲有步骤有重点地进行评产订量，争取今后二年内完全做到固定负担。（六）贯彻奖励生产政策。及时奖励各种发明、创造和劳动模范；适时召开劳动模范会和生产展览会，充分发挥劳动模范作用，推广其经验，带动群众生产。（七）奖励种植工业原料作物，坚持棉粮、烟粮和麻粮的合理比价，认真解决产棉区煤、粮、饲草、肥料等缺乏的困难，尽一切可能保证特产区的农民利益。（八）农村工作干部应逐步学会农业生产技术，团结有技术经验的农民及农业技术人员；发展农村文教工作。（九）特别注意解决贫苦的烈士、军人、工作人员家属及各省偏僻山区和老根据地的群众生产和生活中的困难。
    为保障上述工农业生产的发展，各级人民政府应开展城、乡卫生工作，进一步团结中西医，切实预防疫病，并注意进行卫生宣传教育工作。
    第三、加强城乡物资交流，开展贸易工作和合作社工作。
    发展城乡物资交流，活跃贸易工作，以刺激工农业生产的发展，这是搞好经济建设的重要环节。各级人民政府应重视商业工作。在国营商业领导下，大力发展合作社商业，正确指导私人商业，组织一切群众商业力量，通过合同制、联营等方法，使合作社、私营和独立小生产者的经济与国营商业密切结合起来；同时国营商业要继续改善经营方法，正确掌握价格政策，注意全国物价和地区物价、市价和牌价、货币投放和回笼的正确配合，掌握各种商品间的比价和地区差额，以便坚持和巩固物价稳定。扩大土产经营，实行土产加工并保证规格；组织内地推销，偏远地方酌设一揽子土产公司，同时充分利用集市、庙会等，大力开辟国内市场，供给群众生产和生活的必需品；货品推销必须注意季节及时和群众适用，并保证商业利润上解任务的完成。鼓励私商经营土产；恢复与建立商业网，调整运输，发展河运，修整道路，组织群众运输，并增进运输的计划性。
    对于合作社，必须贯彻为社员服务和上级社为下级社服务的方针，整顿和发展各地合作社，树立社内民主生活和专责制度。在业务方面，应继续加强供销业务，在农村大力推销农、副产品，供给社员生产、生活资料；在城市加强社员消费供给。结束一切脱离下级社的零售部，代之以为下级社服务的批发部、加工工厂或合作货栈。有重点地推广定额、定价、定时的配售制。积极发展农村信用合作事业，开展农村信用贷款。有条件地试办农业生产合作社和城镇手工业生产合作社。广泛发展预购、订购、赊购等合同业务，增强业务计划性，使合作经济在整个经济建设中发挥更大的作用。
    为加强对财政经济工作的领导，必须建立与健全省（市）、专区的财政经济委员会，县成立财政经济办公室，逐级负责计划和检查所辖地区内的财政经济工作，并积极重视财政经济资料的调查研究工作。
    第四、进一步巩固人民民主专政。各省（市）应加强对所属政法各部门的统一领导，取得密切配合。首先是加强治安、司法工作，加强人民防奸工作，严厉镇压一切反革命活动，肃清特务，坚决彻底地消灭少数地区的残余土匪，肃清一贯道，严厉制裁反动不法地主。重视地方武装与民兵建设，保卫各种经济生产。为此，必须继续克服部分干部存在的麻痹轻敌观念，彻底纠正对反革命分子“宽大无边”的思想偏向，正确地贯彻镇压和宽大相结合的方针，切实执行中央人民政府颁布的惩治反革命条例，必须使坚决的反革命分子受到严厉的镇压，而应该宽大的给以宽大；必须配合抗美援朝与反美爱国运动的开展，充分发动广大群众的防奸运动，领导群众学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，才能更有效地肃清一切反革命分子的破坏活动而保障生产建设的顺利进行。
    巩固人民民主专政的另一重要方面，就是必须认真地团结各界人民，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，进一步健全各级各界人民代表会议；继续纠正有些地方对此重视不够和会议的形式主义偏向。今后凡属制度规定须召开而必需召开的会议，应适时召开。凡属人民代表会议的职权范围，必须遵守规定办事，使人民民主生活更加充实和扩大。各省（市）人民政府应系统地总结城市政权建设工作经验，加强城市建政工作的领导，并在各种集会上报纸刊物上对刘少奇副主席二月二十八日在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话，加以宣传和讨论。各地对区、村人民代表会议，应有重点地吸收经验，以求推广；并逐步整顿村政权工作，使之适应当前任务的需要。
    第五、培养和训练干部。这是准备大规模进行经济建设的一项严重任务。各省（市）人民政府的人事工作，必须迅速建立，统一管理干部。有计划有步骤地轮训区、村干部，提高干部的思想、政策水平和办事能力，继续改进干部作风。并注意各种专门干部的培养。加强在职干部的理论、文化学习的督促检查，争取今后一、两年内消灭区以上干部中的文盲。同时注意其他各项文化教育工作的领导，特别是发展工农群众教育；办好各级学校并注意学生的学习生活和健康状况求得适当地调剂，务使学校教育更加适应国家长期建设的需要。
