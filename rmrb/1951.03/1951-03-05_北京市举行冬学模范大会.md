　　Beijing Holds Winter School Model Conference
    To commend the students with excellent academic achievements in winter school, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education held the Beijing Winter School Model Conference on February 28th. More than 300 people attended the conference, including model students, model teachers, and model workers from the winter schools in the suburbs of Beijing. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Li Shusen, Deputy Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, attended the meeting to congratulate them. Deputy Mayor Wu Han also presided over the award ceremony.
    Deputy Mayor Wu Han pointed out at the meeting that the achievements of this year's winter schools in the suburbs are worthy of commendation. The farmers who participated in the winter schools not only learned culture, but also understood the policies of collecting autumn agricultural tax, opposing the Yiguandao sect, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and organizing production, which helped the government promote its work, making the winter schools a powerful assistant to the People's Government in promoting various tasks. He called on the model teachers, model students, and model workers to mobilize and help farmers who have not yet attended winter school and students who are not learning well, so that everyone can work hard to learn. He also asked everyone to turn the winter schools into year-round people's schools and persist in learning.
    After completing the land reform, the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have achieved preliminary improvements in their lives, and their political awareness has generally increased. They have asked to learn culture one after another. A total of 720 winter school classes were opened in the suburbs of the city, with more than 26,000 farmers enrolled, exceeding the original plan of having a winter school in every administrative village. The farmers who enrolled were all in high spirits to learn. Generally, they have learned to recognize one or two hundred characters, and those with better results have learned to recognize two or three hundred characters. They can also keep accounts and write notes; those who are new to arithmetic have learned addition and subtraction. The models selected in the suburbs this winter include 228 model students such as Pei Rongwang, 51 model teachers such as Han Zhongyao, 37 model workers (village cadres, primary school teachers) such as Fu Zongkun, 16 model villages such as Xin Si Village, and 33 model classes (groups) such as Garden Shed.

　　北京市举行冬学模范大会
    为了表扬冬学中学习成绩优异的学员，北京市人民政府文教局于二月二十八日举行北京市冬学模范大会。参加大会的有北京市郊区冬学模范学员、模范教师和模范工作者三百余人。北京市人民政府副市长吴晗、中共北京市委郊区工作委员会书记柴泽民、中央人民政府教育部社会教育司副司长李曙森等都到会向他们道贺。吴晗副市长并主持发奖典礼。
    吴晗副市长在会上指出，今年郊区冬学的成绩是值得表扬的。参加冬学的农民不仅学习了文化，并了解了征收秋季农业税、反一贯道、拥军优属和组织生产等政策，帮助政府推动了工作，使冬学成为人民政府推进各种工作的有力助手。他号召模范教师、模范学员和模范工作者们，要动员和帮助还没有上冬学的农民和学得不好的学员，大家都努力学习。并要求大家把冬学转为常年民校，坚持学习。
    北京市郊区在完成土地改革后，农民生活获得了初步的改善，政治觉悟普遍提高，他们纷纷要求学习文化。市郊区共开办冬学七百二十班，入学农民二万六千余人。超过每一个行政村有一处冬学的原定计划。入学的农民们学习情绪都很高。一般都已认识一、二百字，成绩较好的已能认识二、三百字。并会记账和写便条；初学算术的已学会了加减法。郊区这次冬学评选的模范有模范学员裴荣旺等二百二十八人，模范教师韩忠尧等五十一人，模范工作者（村干部、小学教师）傅宗昆等三十七人，模范村辛四村等十六个村，模范班（组）花园阐等三十三个。
