　　Launching a Mass Fire Prevention and Forest Protection Campaign

    Losing forests means losing the guarantee for agricultural production, because the destruction of forests is followed by disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, sand, and hail. In 1949, after the forests in Lingshi County, Shanxi Province, were completely cut down, a small river (a tributary of the Fen River) originating there, which had never experienced flooding before, flooded more than 50,000 mu of land in 1950.

    The main reasons for forest destruction are two: fire and indiscriminate logging. Fire is especially serious. Last year, there were 2,700 forest fires across the country, and the area of ​​forests burned exceeded the national afforestation area by more than 30 times, with a loss of 2.6 million cubic meters of timber, accounting for 98 percent of the country's timber losses. This is a huge loss. Although most local people's governments have attached great importance to preventing forest fires and have taken many effective measures, there are still a few places that have not paid due attention to such a major event that endangers national wealth.

    Last year, the best job in preventing forest fires was done by Songjiang Province in Northeast China. Some areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also achieved considerable results. Their success has a common feature, which is launching a mass fire prevention and forest protection campaign.

    There are many reasons for forest fires: grass cutting, hunting, train sparks, burning wasteland for reclamation, people going into the mountains smoking, baking dry food, and forestry workers being careless, etc. can all cause forest fires. At the same time, forests are distributed over vast areas. In this case, it is clear that relying solely on forestry cadres to prevent fires is not enough. The only way is to mobilize forest area residents to jointly prevent fires. Last year, Songjiang Province in Northeast China and the forest areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region first established mass forestry organizations from top to bottom. Ten counties in the forest area of ​​Songjiang Province have established forest administration sections, villages have elected forest administration committee members, and 850 forest protection activists have been appointed as forest rangers. A forest protection team including 450 people has been established, and 44 fire alarm watchtowers have been built, thus guaranteeing fire prevention and forest protection organizationally.

    Secondly, in terms of publicity, Songjiang Province mainly uses short-term training courses for forest rangers, forest protection models, and launching fire prevention competitions. In addition, students and theater troupes are organized to carry out publicity among the masses. When forest area residents understand the importance of forests and that protecting forests is in line with their own interests, they will automatically create many methods. For example, in Muling County, Songjiang Province, villages have formulated fire prevention covenants, divided forest areas, and assigned responsibility to different sections; in order to support each other in fighting fires, they have also formulated joint defense covenants; they have also set up women's and children's sentry posts to inspect people entering the mountains; and stipulated that forestry workers entering the mountains should not carry fire, and the team leader is responsible for using fire, etc. These methods have been supported by the broad masses and have been quickly promoted to other places.

    In resolving the contradiction between fire prevention and forest protection and the immediate interests of the masses, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's organization of the Oroqen people's forest protection team is a good example. The Oroqen people living in the forest have difficulty in the spring and have the habit of burning forests for hunting and burning grass to lure animals. The Bayan Forestry Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region gathered young Oroqen people together, gave them short-term training, educated them to plan for long-term interests, and no longer burn forests for hunting. They also purchased the animal skins they stored through cooperatives to solve their living difficulties. The Oroqen people's forest protection team was thus successfully established. They patrol the forest while hunting. In the Duobukuer River forest area protected by the Oroqen people, there has not been a single fire in the past year. It can be seen that if the masses who rely on the mountains and forests for their livelihoods can be organized, they can be transformed from destroyers of forests into the best protectors of forests.

    It is currently the season when forests are most prone to fires. The people's governments of forest areas should vigorously carry out mass fire prevention and forest protection work, strengthen forest protection organizations, widely publicize and educate the masses to value forests, and promote scientific methods of forest protection and fire prevention. This is very necessary.

### 发动群众性的防火护林工作

　　发动群众性的防火护林工作
    萧颖
    失去森林也就使农业生产失掉保障，因为随着森林破坏而来的就是水、旱、风、沙、雹等灾害。一九四九年山西省灵石县森林被伐光后，发源于该地的一条小河（汾河支流），过去从来没有闹过水灾，一九五○年就淹地五万多亩。
    造成森林破坏的主要原因有两个：火灾与滥伐。尤其是火灾最为严重。去年全国森林发生火灾二千七百次，烧毁山林的面积超过全国造林面积约三十余倍，损失木材达二百六十万立方米，占全国木材损失量的百分之九十八。这是一种巨大的损失。目前各地人民政府大部虽已高度重视对森林火灾的防止，采取了许多有效措施；但是，直到现在还有少数地方，对危害国家财富如此重大的事件，还未引起应有的注意。
    去年防止森林火灾做得最好的是东北松江省，其次是内蒙古自治区部分地区也获得相当成绩。他们的成功，有着一个共同的特点，就是发动群众性的防火护林工作。
    森林火灾发生的原因是很多的，打草、狩猎、火车喷火、烧荒垦田。人山行人吸烟、烤干粮，及林业工人不慎等等都能引起森林的火灾。同时，森林又分布在广大地区。在这种情况下，显然地，单依靠林业干部防火是不够的，唯一的办法是发动林区居民共同防火。去年东北松江省与内蒙古自治区林区首先从上而下地建立了群众性的林业机构。松江省林区十个县均设立了林政科，各村都选出了林政委员，并委任八百五十名护林积极分子为护林员，成立有包括四百五十人的护林队，又建筑了四十四座火警了望台，因此，就使防火护林在组织上有了保证。
    其次，在宣传工作方面，松江省主要的是通过护林员的短期训练班，护林模范，发动防火竞赛等办法来进行的。此外，又组织学生和剧团在广大群众中进行宣传。当林区居民了解了森林的重要，和保护森林与自己切身利益一致时，就自动创造很多办法。像松江省穆棱县，村村订立防火公约，划分林区，分段负责；为互相支援扑救火灾，又订立了联防公约；更设立妇女、儿童岗哨，检查入山行人；规定林业工人入山不带火种，队长负责用火等。这些办法都得到了广大群众的拥护，并很快地推广到其他的地方去。
    在解决防火护林与群众眼前利益矛盾方面，内蒙古自治区组织鄂伦春人的护林队就是一个很好的例子。居住在森林中的鄂伦春人，春季生活困难，有焚林而猎、烧草诱兽的习惯。内蒙古自治区巴彦林务局就把鄂伦春人青年人召集在一起，给以短期训练，教育他们为长远利益打算，不再焚林行猎。并通过合作社收购他们贮存的兽皮，解决他们的生活困难。鄂伦春人的护林队这样才顺利地成立起来。他们一面打猎，一面巡护森林。在鄂伦春人防护的一个多布库尔河林区，一年来没有发生一次火灾。由此可见，如能把依靠山林生活的群众组织起来，可以使他们从森林的破坏者变成最好的护林者。
    目前正是森林最易发生火灾的季节，各地林区人民政府，应大力开展群众性的防火护林工作，加强护林组织，广泛宣传教育群众重视森林，推广科学的护林防火办法，这是很必要的。
