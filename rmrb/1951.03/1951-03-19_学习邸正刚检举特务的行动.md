    Learning from Di Zhenggang's Action of Exposing Special Agents
    To the Editors:
    Reading the letter from Beijing citizen Di Zhenggang exposing the special agent Han Xihou, published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 10th, moved us deeply. It fully demonstrates how much the people of the new China love our own country.
    Mr. Di Zhenggang's spirit of loving the country and the people is worthy of study by every person in the country. The special agents of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are spreading rumors and sabotage everywhere, causing a lot of damage to the Chinese people. In order to resolutely suppress these counter-revolutionary elements and correct the past "unlimited leniency" bias in implementation in various regions, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." Now is the time for our vast masses of people to expose special agents. Every Chinese person should contribute their strength to assist the government in completing this major task. Only with the joint efforts of the broad masses can the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries be successfully completed.

    To the Editors:
    Beijing citizen Mr. Di Zhenggang exposed the special agent Han Xihou. For this exemplary case, I suggest that the public security organs systematically use various methods to publicize it to the citizens, so that everyone recognizes that it is the responsibility of every citizen to expose special agents and should actively help the government eliminate them. In this way, hidden counter-revolutionary elements will have nowhere to hide under the supervision of the broad masses of people, and the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries can be successfully completed.

    学习邸正刚检举特务的行动编辑同志：
    读了三月十日人民日报《读者来信》栏发表的北京市民邸正刚检举特务韩锡厚的来信，使我们非常感动，这充分表现出新中国的人民是如何热爱我们自己的祖国。
    邸正刚先生这种爱祖国、爱人民的精神是值得全国每一个人民学习的。美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的特务，到处造谣破坏，已经给中国人民造成了很多的损失。中央人民政府为了坚决镇压这些反革命分子，纠正过去各地在执行中的“宽大无边”的偏向，颁布了《惩治反革命条例》。现在正是我们广大人民检举特务的时候了。每一个中国人民都应该拿出自己的力量，协助政府完成这件重大的任务。只有广大群众共同努力，镇压反革命的工作才能顺利完成。
        读者  田成安  朱奇生编辑同志：
    北京市民邸正刚先生检举了特务韩锡厚。这种模范事例，我建议公安机关应有计划地用各种方法向市民进行宣传，使大家认识检举特务是每个人民的责任，应该积极帮助政府肃清特务。这样，就能使暗藏的反革命分子在广大人民监视下，无处藏身；镇压反革命的工作也就能顺利完成。
