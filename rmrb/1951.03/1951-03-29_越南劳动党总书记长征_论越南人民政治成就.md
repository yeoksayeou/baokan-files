Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 28th. Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 24th: The Vietnam Workers' Party's official publication, "People's Weekly," recently published an article by Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, entitled "Unite and Fight for Independence, Democracy, and Peace." The article pointed out that at the beginning of 1951, following military victories, the Vietnamese people held a national congress to establish the Vietnam Workers' Party, a national congress to merge the Viet Minh and the Lien Viet Fronts, and a conference to establish the Joint National United Front of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The leadership of the Vietnamese working class has been strengthened, and the national united fronts of Indochina are advancing. The line of the Vietnamese people's democratic revolution, the general program of the Vietnamese National United Front, and the general political programs of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have been decided.

The article pointed out that these recently held national congresses mark greater progress in Vietnam's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. The political victories gained by the Vietnamese people at these congresses will surely lead to many other victories. Through unity, effort, and struggle, the Vietnamese people will surely defeat the French aggressors and the American interventionists.

The article especially emphasized the important significance of the national congress for the merger of the Viet Minh and Lien Viet Fronts, expressing support for the World Peace Council's declaration. The article stated that this shows the determination of the Vietnamese people to unite, not only to defeat the aggressors and strive for independence and democracy, but also to dedicate themselves to maintaining world peace.

    【新华社二十八日讯】越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南劳动党机关刊《人民周刊》顷发表越南劳动党总书记长征所撰一文，题为《为独立、民主与和平而团结和斗争》。论文指出：越南人民在一九五一年开头，继军事上的胜利以后，举行了一次为成立越南劳动党而召开的全国代表大会，一次为合并越盟和越联而召开的全国代表大会，还有一次为成立越南、老挝和柬埔寨的联合民族统一阵线而召开的会议。越南工人阶级的领导已经加强，印度支那的民族统一阵线正在迈步前进。越南人民民主革命的路线、越南民族统一阵线的一般纲领以及越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的一般政治纲领已经决定。
    论文指出：最近举行的这些全国代表大会，标志着越南在争取独立、和平与民主的斗争中有了更大的进步。越南人民在这些大会上所获得的政治胜利，一定会引起许多别的胜利。由于团结、努力和战斗，越南人民一定会击败法国侵略者和美国干涉者。
    论文特别强调为合并越盟和越联而召开的全国代表大会对世界和平理事会的宣言表示拥护的重要意义。论文称：这表示越南人民的决心团结，不仅是为了击败侵略者和争取独立与民主，而且也是为了要致力于维护世界和平。
