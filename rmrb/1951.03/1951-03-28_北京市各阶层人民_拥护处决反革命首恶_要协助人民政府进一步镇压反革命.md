　　The People of All Strata in Beijing
     Support the Execution of the Chief Counter-Revolutionaries
     Want to Assist the People's Government in Further Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
    [Our Newspaper] The people of all strata in Beijing applauded the measure of executing a group of special agents, heads of reactionary secret societies, habitual bandits, and despots on the 25th.

    More than 600 workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant witnessed the execution of the great despot and leader of Yiguan Tao, Tang Yaoxi, and they happily said, "Good riddance! Executing 'Guixin Tang' is truly gratifying to the people." Workers at the Beijing Railway Bureau said, "Counter-revolution is a disease; if it is not treated early, it will be fatal." Worker Li Qiming said to other workers, "If we work hard to produce, the special agents can burn it all in one fire. With counter-revolutionaries, we cannot produce freely. Executing them will allow us to work in peace." Shang Lu's, who lives in the fifth district of Changping, had her son, Shang Boqing, killed by the despot Li Tiebao. After seeing her son's enemy executed, she held the hand of a public security officer and said gratefully, "You have finally stood up for us." Farmer Wang Wencheng said, "These guys are a bunch of wolves. It was wrong to be lenient with them in the past. They would bite the common people at every opportunity. It's not a pity to shoot them this time." Students from Tsinghua University and Jiaotong University all believed that these criminals had both human and material evidence of their crimes and should have been killed long ago. Tricycle workers were very happy to see the execution of the counter-revolutionary elements! Guo Fengshan said, "These guys used to beat us rickshaw pullers. Can we still talk about leniency towards them today? Executing these bastards is not enough." The manager of Qianxiang Cloth Shop said, "It won't work if they aren't killed. Take my shop, for example, if it were like Lingling in Hunan, wouldn't we be finished in one fire!"

    The people of Beijing, who had suffered greatly from the persecution of counter-revolutionaries in the past, are now avenging their hatred. After the special agent Wang Shoulung was executed in Qinghe Town, more than ten workers from the Qinghe Woolen Mill ran to the execution ground after work and cursed Wang Shoulung's corpse while stepping on it. The production enthusiasm of the workers in the combing and spinning department of the factory has also been improved. In the past, six spinning wheels spun 2,300 jin of yarn a day, but now five spinning wheels can spin the same amount. Farmers in Jiugong Village said after seeing the execution of the despotic landlord Shuang Deli: the execution of Shuang Deli is the elimination of a great scourge; the whole village is happy and relieved!

    After the execution of this group of counter-revolutionaries, the prestige of the People's Government has been greatly enhanced. Farmer Liu Wuben of Dashiqiao Village, Qinghe Town, said, "During the land reform, we requested the execution of these despots many times, but the government did not deal with it, and we dared not ask again. Now it looks like a real People's Government, and it's really giving us a chance to vent our anger." Liu Meirong said, "Now the people are not afraid. The nail has been pulled out! If we find special agents, we will report them to the People's Government." Farmers in Dahuangzhuang said, "The people are the eyes. As long as the government has policies, we will definitely not let any special agents escape."

    The People's Government's execution of these heinous counter-revolutionary elements has further raised the vigilance of the broad masses of the people. Wu Guiqin and Wu Lin, students of the Normal University, both believe that in order to assist the government in reporting special agents, propaganda should be strengthened within the school. Pang Shaojun, an employee of the Mentougou Coal Mine Company, proposed that security work in factories and mines should be strengthened in the future to prevent sabotage. Since the execution of this group of counter-revolutionary elements, reactionary elements in various factories and enterprises have been registering themselves in recent days. Among them, there are seventy-five in the People's Printing Factory, sixty in various factories and enterprises in Changxindian, and more than ten in the Mentougou Coal Mine Company.

 　　北京市各阶层人民
     拥护处决反革命首恶
     要协助人民政府进一步镇压反革命
    【本报讯】北京市各阶层人民，对二十五日枪决一批特务、反动会道门头子、惯匪和恶霸的措施，无不拍手称快。
    石景山发电厂六百多工人，亲眼看到枪决了大恶霸、一贯道头子唐耀西，他们高兴地说：“杀的好，枪决了‘亏心唐’，才大快人心。”北京铁路分局的工人说：“反革命是块病，不早治就要命。”工人李启明对别的工人说：“我们努力生产，特务一把火就全烧完了，有了反革命，就不能放手生产，枪决了他们，才能安心。”住在昌平第五区的尚路氏，她的儿子尚伯卿是被恶霸李铁宝害死的，这次她看到杀她儿子的仇人被处死后，她拉着公安人员的手感激地说：“你们总算给我们撑了腰了。”农民王文成说：“这伙子都是一群狼，过去对他们宽大是不对的，他们一有机会就咬老百姓一下子，这回枪崩了，一点也不屈。”清华大学和交通大学的同学们都认为这些罪犯的人证物证俱在，早就该杀了。三轮车工人看到枪决反革命分子可高兴啦！郭凤山说：“这些家伙从前常揍咱们拉车的，今天还能对他们讲宽大么？枪决这些杂种们不算多。”谦祥布店的经理说：“不杀他们可不行，就拿我柜上说，要像湖南零陵那样，一把火我们不就完了么！”
    过去受尽了反革命残害的北京人民，现在可仇报雪恨了。当特务王寿隆在清河镇上被枪决以后，清河制呢厂的十多个工人在下班以后，跑到刑场，踏着王寿隆的尸首痛骂。该厂梳纺部工人的生产情绪也提高了，从前六个纺车一天纺二千三百斤纱，现在五个纺车也纺到了这个数目。九宫村农民看到枪决恶霸地主双德立，都表示：枪决了双德立算除了大害，全村人又痛快，又解恨！
    枪决了这批反革命以后，人民政府威信大大提高。清河镇大石桥村农民刘务本说：“土地改革时，我们要求枪毙这些恶霸，要求了好几次，政府都没处理，以后也不敢再问；现在才像个人民政府的样子，真给咱们出气了。”刘美容说：“现在老百姓不害怕了，拔了钉子啦！发现特务，我们就要向人民政府检举。”大黄庄的农民说：“人民是眼睛，政府只要有政策，咱们一定不让特务漏网。”
    人民政府处决了这些罪大恶极的反革命分子，更使广大人民提高了警惕。师范大学同学吴桂琴、吴琳都认为：为了协助政府检举特务，要在校内加强宣传。门头沟煤矿公司职员庞绍俊则提出：以后更要加强工厂、矿山的保卫工作，防止破坏。自从枪决这批反革命分子后，连日以来，各工厂、企业中都有反动分子进行登记。其中，人民印刷厂就有七十五个，长辛店各工厂、企业有六十个，门头沟煤矿公司也有十多个反动分子进行登记。
