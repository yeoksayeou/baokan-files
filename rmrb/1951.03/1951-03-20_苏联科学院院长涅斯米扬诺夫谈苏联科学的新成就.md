Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Stalin Prize Committee for Science and Inventions, recently made the following statement to a TASS correspondent:

　　The Soviet people are delighted with the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to award Stalin Prizes for outstanding works in science and are proud of the great motherland led by Stalin's genius. This decision is a clear demonstration of the new successes of advanced Soviet science, all of whose efforts are aimed at defending peace and progress throughout the world and at building communism in our country.

　　The complexity and diversity of recently completed scientific research, and its connection with the socialist national economy, show the increasing importance of science in our lives. Soviet scientists have a deep understanding of the historical tasks that Stalin has set for our people, and they are actively assisting in the implementation of Stalin's plan to transform nature and the great communist construction projects; they are advancing in the ranks of the vanguard of peace defenders throughout the world.

　　The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers on awarding the Stalin Prizes for 1950 mentions outstanding works in physics, mathematics, mechanics, technology, chemistry, geology and geography, biology, agricultural science, medicine, as well as history and linguistics.

　　The research conducted by a group of physicists headed by Dr. of Physics and Mathematics, Brekhovskikh, forms the main part of these outstanding achievements.

　　Under the leadership of Academician Skobeltsyn, the Lebedev Institute of Physics conducted research on cosmic ray radiation, which made it possible to elucidate the interaction of cosmic rays with matter in a new way, and to link the study of cosmic ray radiation with the study of atomic nuclear processes. The outstanding physicist, Corresponding Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Lazarev, has significantly expanded our knowledge of the properties of matter at low temperatures. Professor Torasov has created a new quantum theory of heat for solids.

　　Among the representative works in mechanics and mathematics mentioned in the Soviet government's decision to award prizes are the works of scientists such as Gelfond, Dorodnicyn, Men'shov, and Smirnov. Gelfond, Head of the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, enriched mathematics with group theory and provided new methods for solving various mathematical problems. A work by Professor Men'shov of Moscow University discusses a part of mathematics that is very important for physics and technology—the theory of trigonometric series. The last part of this work contains Men'shov's outstanding research in this area.

　　In the technological progress of our motherland, and in the post-war development of our productive forces to complete the complex tasks of the national economy, the role of science is great. Among the works in technical sciences, the works of Academician Zhukakov and Professor Lykov are mentioned.

　　The Stalin Prize was awarded to hydraulic engineers Kritsky and Munkel, the authors of "The Hydraulic Basis of River Hydraulic Engineering," whose work is being used to design the Volga-Don Canal, the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations, and the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal.

　　The Stalin Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Vinogradov, for his scientific work "The Geochemistry of Rare and Dispersed Chemical Elements in Soils"; and to Dr. of Chemistry, Kosyak, for his monograph "Chemistry of High Molecular Compounds." Valuable research in hydrocarbon chemistry includes the works of Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Arbuzov, and Professor Tischenko of the Leningrad Wood Industry Academy. Stalin Prize winner, Artykin, completed extensive and important work, proposing the hydrochemical characteristics of 1,300 rivers in the Soviet Union, and writing a textbook "General Hydrochemistry," which is the first textbook on this subject in the world.

　　Following the tradition of Russian geographers, ocean explorers, and the world's first cartographers, Soviet scientists Professor Isakov and others compiled "Maritime Geographic Explanations," including nautical charts of the world's oceans.

　　Biology now occupies one of the important positions in the national scientific life. In the past year, scientists—biologists and agricultural science experts—have made great contributions to Michurin biology.

　　The first prize of the Stalin Prize was awarded to a group of scientists headed by Dr. of Biology, Boretsky, for their scientific work "Dihydroxy Analysis," which is very important for explaining the origin and age of alluvial stones, the history of reservoirs, their past vegetation, and climate. Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Avakyan, has made great contributions in this regard. Avakyan determined in experiments with bulbous plants that the biological properties of plant organisms that can restart development in their offspring not only exist in embryo cells but also in reproductive plant organs formed by the cell tissues of the maternal organism that are identical to the embryo cells. These studies represent a further exploration of the theory of plant development at all stages and are of great significance to biology. Dr. of Biological Sciences, Chakhvatkin, solved one of the most important problems in animal evolutionary embryology—the origin of multicellular animals—and determined the relationship between the simplest invertebrates and multicellular animals.

　　The works of Stalin Prize winners Gilyarov, Krasilnikov, Olifkov, Larin, Filatov, Darakishvili, Daraselia, Tsorn, Zobrilin, Minkevich, and Bolkovsky reflect the active struggle of science to increase the productivity of animal husbandry, increase crop yields, and acclimatize them to the soil and water of new environments.

　　The famous physiologist Ushevich was awarded the first prize of the Stalin Prize for his two works, "The Condition of the Cerebral Cortex and the Activity of Biological Viscera" and "The Influence of Cutting the Frontal Lobe of the Brain on the Higher Nervous Activity of Dogs." Professor Ushevich, a disciple and successor of the great Russian physiologist Academician Pavlov, inherited and developed Pavlov's theory of the types of higher nervous activity, clarifying that the influence of the cortex of the cerebral hemisphere on the visceral functions of various types of animals is different.

　　Professors Lange, Rubinstein, Pogorelov, Kashkin, Podyapolskaya, and Kapustin ingeniously applied Pavlov's theory to medicine, achieving significant achievements in the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases. They all received the Stalin Prize.

　　The works of historians and linguists who won the Stalin Prize are characterized by creativity, a wide range of historical materials, and a deep connection with socialist modernity. These outstanding representatives of the humanities, based on Lenin-Stalin's theory, created works that clearly reflect our country's new cultural progress.

　　Academician Vinogradov's scientific work "The Russian Language (On the Grammatical Principles of Words)," which won the Stalin Prize, clarifies the gradually enriched and perfected Russian grammar system from Pushkin to the present. Vinogradov confirmed the natural interrelationship between lexical structure and grammatical order, created a theory about parts of speech, about the interaction of parts of speech in the development process, and determined the structure of the shape and meaning of words. Vinogradov's theory of words profoundly clarified the rich grammatical structure of the Russian language for the first time. Among the works in linguistics that won the Stalin Prize is a scientific work by Candidate of Linguistics, Chesnokov, which is dedicated to the famous Russian revolutionary democrat, philosopher, and writer Herzen.

　　This year, the authors of textbooks and popular science works won the Stalin Prize for the first time. This kind of scientific effort is of inestimable significance for training expert cadres and attracting the broad masses of the people to study science.

　　The awarding of the Stalin Prize is a great festival in the lives of our people. It encourages the Soviet people to move towards new creative and labor victories for peace, for the victory of communism, and for the leader of all progressive mankind, the master of science—the great Stalin.
