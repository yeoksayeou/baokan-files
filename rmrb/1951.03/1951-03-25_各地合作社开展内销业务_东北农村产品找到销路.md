Cooperatives in Various Regions Develop Domestic Sales
Northeast Rural Products Find Sales Channels

	Cooperatives in Northeast China are strengthening connections between provinces and counties within the Northeast region, organizing material exchanges through contracts, and expanding domestic sales of rural products. This has allowed large quantities of rural products to find sales channels, laying a good foundation for farmers to expand reproduction. According to statistics from cooperatives in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces, as well as Dalian, Shenyang, Anshan, and Benxi cities, a total of 30 joint venture contracts and 5 purchase contracts have been signed, with a total value of exchanged products reaching 269.7 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Contracts have also been signed between counties within each province. For example, in Liaoxi Province alone, 29 joint venture contracts and 50 purchase contracts were signed in the fourth quarter, with a total product value of over 230 billion yuan, of which native products, specialties, and by-products accounted for 59.2%.

	Although cooperatives have achieved preliminary success in developing domestic sales through contracts, there are still some problems in the process of signing and executing contracts. Some contracts cannot be signed at all due to differences of opinion between the parties, and some cannot be executed after signing. For example, among the 35 contracts signed between the four provinces and five cities, 10 were not completed and 13 were cancelled. The reasons for this, in addition to difficulties in railway transportation, are mainly due to the fact that some cooperatives do not take a broad view and are too concerned about profits. For example, the Shenyang City Cooperative General Office planned to sign a joint venture contract for pork with the Heilongjiang Cooperative General Office, but it was not realized due to profit considerations. At the Northeast Cooperative General Office business meeting last November, the grain company proposed an order for grass bags, mats, and 茓 valued at 193.879 billion yuan, but it could not be concluded due to the thinking of "rather let it run away than lose a little." This profit-oriented thinking seriously hinders sales work. To this day, Jilin, Liaoxi, Liaodong and other provinces still have a lot of grass bags in stock that cannot find sales channels.

	Secondly, most cooperatives at all levels cannot systematically grasp the figures, output, prices, and historical conditions of agricultural, sideline, native, and special products that need to be sold, resulting in blind contract signing. For example, the Dalian City Cooperative ordered 300 tons of Jilin soybeans from the Songjiang Province Cooperative, but the contract was cancelled because the Songjiang Province Cooperative had no goods to supply to the Dalian City Cooperative. Another example is that the Songjiang Province Cooperative and the Liaodong Province Cooperative ordered two train cars each of peanuts and apples, but both requested the other party to cancel the contract because the order price exceeded the market price in Harbin.

	In light of the above situation, the Northeast Cooperative General Office held a meeting of trade section chiefs of provincial cooperatives in mid-February and, based on past experience, proposed that when signing contracts, it is necessary to fully grasp the local specific situation and consider it carefully to avoid the contract failing; the contract terms should be specific and have certain penalty clauses; after signing the contract, it is necessary to understand the situation in detail and supervise and inspect it at any time.

### 各地合作社开展内销业务  东北农村产品找到销路

　　各地合作社开展内销业务
    东北农村产品找到销路
    东北各地合作社加强东北区内省、县之间的联系，通过订合同方式组织物资交流，扩大农村产品的内销后，已使大批农村产品找到销路，给农民扩大再生产打下了良好基础。仅据辽东、辽西、松江、吉林等省合作社，及旅大、沈阳、鞍山、本溪等市社统计，共签订联营合同三十份，购买合同五份，交换产品总值达二千六百九十七亿元（东北币下同）。各省内县与县之间订了合同，如辽西省仅第四季度就签订了联营合同二十九份，收购合同五十份，产品总值达二千三百余亿元，其中土产、特产、副产品占百分之五十九点二。
    合作社通过合同在开展内销业务中虽已获得初步成绩，但在签订与执行合同过程中还存在若干问题。有的是因双方意见不同而根本不能签订合同，有的是签订合同后不能执行。如四省五市间所签订的三十五份合同中，就有十份没完成，十三份作废。综合其原因，除了铁路运输困难等以外，主要是某些合作社不从大处着眼，斤斤计较利润所致。如沈阳市合作总社拟与黑龙江合作总社签订猪肉联营合同，因利润关系没有实现。去年十一月东北合作总社业务会议上，粮食公司提出的总值一万九千三百八十七亿九千万元的草袋、席、茓等定货单，也因“宁肯跑了，不要少了”的思想所支配，而不能成交。这种斤斤计较利润的思想，严重的阻碍了推销工作，直到现在，吉林、辽西、辽东等省还积压了很多的草袋找不到销路。
    其次是各级合作社，多数不能有系统地掌握农、副、土、特产品需要推销的数字和产量、价格、历史情况等，以致造成订定合同的盲目性。如旅大市社订购松江省合作社的三百吨吉豆，由于松江省社无货供应旅大市社而将合同作废。又如松江省社与辽东省社订购了花生、苹果各两个车皮，均因订购价格超出哈尔滨市价而请求对方将合同作废。
    根据以上情况，东北合作总社在二月中旬召开的各省社贸易科长会议进行了讨论，根据过去经验提出：在订合同时必须充分掌握当地具体情况，缜密考虑，以免合同落空；合同条文要具体，要有一定的罚则；订合同后应具体了解情况，随时督促检查。
