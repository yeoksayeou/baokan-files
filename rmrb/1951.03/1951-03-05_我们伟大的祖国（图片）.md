    Our Great Motherland
    These two large cannons were cast around 1356 during the peasant uprising in the Zhejiang area of our country. They are the earliest surviving cannons. As early as the ninth century, Chinese alchemists accidentally mixed sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter while refining elixirs, causing a fire and thus discovering "gunpowder." By the tenth century, our country had begun to use gunpowder in military affairs, more than four hundred years earlier than Europe.

    我们伟大的祖国
    这两个大炮筒，是公元一千三百五十六年我国浙江一带农民起义时期所铸造的。这是至今尚存的最早的火炮。早在第九世纪，我国炼丹家在炼制丹药的时候，偶然把硫磺、炭和硝混合在一起，以致发火，因此发现了“火药”。至第十世纪，我国在军事上已开始使用火药，比欧洲早四百多年。
