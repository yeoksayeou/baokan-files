Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

To the Editors:

Regarding the criticism made by An Yaoxian, published in the People's Daily on January 22nd, that "Winter schools in various parts of the Ding County Special District have fallen into self-flow this year," we have studied it, consider it correct, and fully accept this opinion. We have conducted a self-criticism. We believe that the education departments' failure to effectively grasp the work of winter schools is the main reason for the formation of self-flow. However, the self-flow phenomenon occurred before December. At that time, it was precisely when winter school funding could not be resolved. According to instructions from higher authorities, winter school funding should be self-raised by the villages, but the majority of villages neither raised funds nor operated winter schools. In addition, our cadres did not combine winter schools with the central work, which caused the winter schools to stagnate and enter a state of self-flow for a time. After discovering this situation on December 9th, we immediately proposed emergency measures after research, instructing leading cadres at all levels to correct the idea of neglecting winter schools and to regard winter schools as a powerful weapon for solving the masses' ideological problems, completing production tasks, and all central work; patriotic and internationalist education should be strengthened in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland movement.

The county and district levels separately convened village leader conferences to implement the spirit of the winter school movement, and stipulated that schools should be universally opened within ten days (villages in severely affected disaster areas should act according to the actual situation and not implement mechanically). County and district leaders should conduct inspections in a planned manner in conjunction with other work. The winter school lamp oil fees and regular expenses will be uniformly issued by the county, calculated at half a catty of rice per student per month based on the actual number of students in each village.

By the end of December, the tendency towards self-flow was basically reversed. According to incomplete statistics: out of 2,719 administrative villages in the entire special district, 1,692 administrative villages had opened winter schools, with 100,291 male and female students participating in learning. From a quantitative point of view, this is much different from last year, but from a qualitative point of view, there is a new progress. Because most of the students developed from small to large on a conscious and voluntary basis, the phenomenon of a mass rush no longer exists.

### 定县专区对冬学自流现象的答复

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    定县专区对冬学自流现象的答复编辑同志：
    人民日报一月二十二日发表了安耀先批评“定县专区各地今年冬学陷于自流”的意见，经我们研究，认为正确，我们完全接受这个意见，并作了检讨。我们认为教育部门没有抓紧冬学工作，是形成自流的主要原因。不过，自流现象是十二月以前的事情。那时，正是冬学经费无法解决的时候，根据上级指示，冬学经费应由村自筹，但是大多数村，既不筹经费，也不办冬学。再加上我们干部没有使冬学和中心工作结合，因此使冬学一时陷于停顿、自流状态。十二月九日发现这种情况后，我们经过研究，当即提出紧急措施，指示各级领导干部必须纠正忽视冬学的思想，把冬学看成是解决群众思想问题、完成生产任务及一切中心工作的有力武器；应结合抗美援朝保家卫国运动加强爱国主义和国际主义的教育。
    各县区分别召开了村长会议，贯彻冬学运动精神，并规定于十天内普遍开学（重灾区村，要根据实际情况，不机械执行）。县区领导上，则应结合其他工作有计划地进行检查。关于冬学灯油费及经常费改由县统一发给，按各村实有学员人数，每人每月半斤米计。
    到十二月底，即基本扭转自流的偏向。据不完全的统计：全专区二千七百一十九个行政村中有一千六百九十二个行政村开办了冬学，参加学习的男女学员十万零二千九百九十一名。从数量上看是比去年相差很多，但从质量上看却有个新的进步。因为学员大部是在自觉自愿由小到大的基础上发展起来的，一哄而起的现象已不存在了。
