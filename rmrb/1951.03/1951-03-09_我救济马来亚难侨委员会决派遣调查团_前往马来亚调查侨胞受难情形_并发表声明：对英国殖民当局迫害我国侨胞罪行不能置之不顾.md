Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees, initiated by the China Relief General Association and other charitable and people's organizations, held its first meeting on the 6th. The committee members present included Xiong Jinjing, Wu Yunfu, Pu Huairen, Li Dequan, Fei Zhendong, Cao Mengjun, Qian Sanqiang, and 14 others, totaling twenty-one people.

The meeting elected Xiong Jinjing as the chairman of the committee, and Wu Yunfu, Fei Zhendong, Cao Mengjun, and Jin Ziming as vice-chairmen.

The meeting discussed the increasingly severe persecution of our overseas Chinese by the British colonial authorities in Malaya. The meeting held that the Chinese people could not sit idly by and ignore the planned and large-scale persecution of our overseas Chinese by British imperialism. The meeting decided to organize a Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees Investigation Team to go to Malaya to investigate the actual suffering of our overseas Chinese. The investigation team consists of Wu Zhizhi, Wu Feng, Du Ai, Jin Ziming, Hu Yisheng, Pu Huairen, Chen Jingzhen, Qi Yun, Huang Yaomian, Huang Lǜping, Huang Zhensheng, Huang Dingchen, Yang Jingtong, Zhang Zhuangfei, Zhang Chukun, Lu Xinyuan, and Nie Weiqing, seventeen people in total, with Pu Huairen as the head of the team, and Wu Zhizhi, Du Ai, and Zhang Chukun as the deputy heads.

Finally, the meeting adopted a statement on the organization of an investigation team to go to Malaya to investigate the situation of the suffering compatriots. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, various democratic parties, and people's organizations have repeatedly protested the various brutal acts of the British colonial authorities in Malaya in persecuting our overseas Chinese in Malaya. However, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have not only not stopped their measures to undermine our overseas Chinese, but have intensified and continued to expand their barbaric acts of persecuting overseas Chinese.

On January 25th, British Malayan High Commissioner Gurney publicly announced that by the end of last year, eighty-two "immigrant camps" had been established in Malaya, and a total of 78,000 of our overseas Chinese had been forced to move into them. Since the beginning of this year, this plan has continued to be actively carried out. According to the plan of the British colonial authorities, a total of 328 "immigrant camps" will be established, and a total of 412,000 of our overseas Chinese will be forced to relocate. From December 12th to 16th last year, in Singapore alone, according to disclosures in Singapore newspapers, more than 1,100 overseas Chinese were arrested.

In order to arrest overseas Chinese on a large scale, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have set up many special agencies. In Singapore alone, two so-called "crime investigation zones" in the north and south with huge organizations have been added, and the concentration camps for imprisoning our overseas Chinese have been generally expanded. For example, the "Xinshan concentration camp can accommodate 1,000 more detainees after expansion." In the Sipai slope prison, "more than 200 people were held in one room, including children in their teens and old men in their seventies and eighties," and "each meal consisted of only a small ball of rice." The tortures, extortions, and rapes suffered by overseas Chinese are too numerous to mention. British Member of Parliament Harvey recently publicly stated: "We must somehow drive these detainees out of Malaya."

Large-scale expulsion of overseas Chinese from Malaya is a long-standing plan of the British government, which has recently been intensified. The British colonial authorities in Malaya are determined to expel our overseas Chinese from Malaya in batches. Since last November, four batches of overseas Chinese, totaling 2,813 people, have been successively expelled and returned to the motherland. The fifth batch is now on the road, and the sixth and seventh batches may be expelled at any time. When expelling our overseas Chinese, the British colonial authorities in Malaya also forced the arrested overseas Chinese to fill out so-called "voluntary departure application forms," attempting to cover up the truth of their illegal expulsion of our overseas Chinese. As for the various shocking and bloody incidents in which the British colonial authorities in Malaya searched overseas Chinese schools under various pretexts, revised the methods for returning to Malaya visas, bombed overseas Chinese villages, implemented "collective punishment," forcibly conscripted strong men, and created "dead zones," they are emerging one after another.

The Chinese people are filled with righteous indignation at the illegal crimes of the British colonial authorities in Malaya, and they are determined not to sit idly by. Everyone knows that Malaya's achievements today are the result of the hard work of 2.8 million overseas Chinese and the local people. After the outbreak of World War II, Japan occupied Malaya, and the British army surrendered without a fight. During the four years of occupation, it was also the overseas Chinese and local laboring people who resolutely resisted the Japanese invading forces. Today, the British colonial authorities in Malaya are treating our overseas Chinese with fascist cruelty.

The Chinese people are closely concerned about the serious situation caused by the British colonial authorities' cruel persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya. At the same time, we believe that this is also a matter of serious attention and concern for all people of justice and humanity in the world. Based on this position, our charitable organizations and people's organizations accepted the suggestion of the returned overseas Chinese in Beijing at the "Demonstration against the United States Arming Japan" and jointly organized the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees, and decided to send an investigation team to various parts of Malaya to investigate the actual situation of the suffering of our overseas Chinese, so as to submit a true report to our people and people of all countries in the world who are concerned about this issue.

The investigation team will soon depart for Malaya to carry out its mission, and is prepared to provide investigation reports to all sectors at home and abroad who are concerned about this issue at any time. We hope that all people of justice and humanity in the country and around the world will strongly support our just action.

　　我救济马来亚难侨委员会决派遣调查团
    前往马来亚调查侨胞受难情形
    并发表声明：对英国殖民当局迫害我国侨胞罪行不能置之不顾
    【新华社八日讯】由中国人民救济总会等慈善团体及人民团体发起组织的中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会于六日举行第一次会议。出席的有委员熊瑾玎、伍云甫、浦化人、李德全、费振东、曹孟君、钱三强等二十一人。
    会议选出熊瑾玎为委员会的主任委员；伍云甫、费振东、曹孟君和金子明为副主任委员。
    会议讨论了马来亚的英国殖民当局日益加剧地迫害我侨胞的情况。会议认为：中国人民对于英帝国主义有计划地大规模迫害我侨胞的举动，不能坐视不顾。会议决定组织中国人民救济马来亚难侨调查团，前赴马来亚调查我侨胞受难的实际情形。调查团由伍治之、吴风、杜埃、金子明、胡一声、浦化人、陈经镇、戚云、黄药眠、黄绿萍、黄振声、黄鼎臣、杨静桐、张壮飞、张楚琨、卢心远、聂维庆十七人组成，由浦化人任团长，伍治之、杜埃、张楚琨任副团长。
    会议最后通过就组织调查团赴马来亚调查难胞情况一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    对于马来亚英国殖民地当局迫害我国在马来亚侨胞的种种残暴行为，我外交部及各民主党派、各人民团体，已多次提出抗议。但马来亚英国殖民地当局不仅未停止其摧残我国侨胞之措施，且变本加厉，继续扩大其迫害华侨的野蛮行为。
    英国马来亚高级专员格尔奈于一月二十五日公开宣布：到去年年底止，马来亚已建立了八十二处“移民营”，我国侨胞被迫迁入的共七万八千人。今年年初以来，此项计划正继续积极进行。按照英国殖民当局计划，将共建立“移民营”三百二十八处，我国侨胞之被迫迁居者将共达四十一万二千人。自去年十二月十二日至十六日，仅新加坡一地，根据新加坡各报披露，即捕去华侨一千一百余人。
    马来亚英国殖民地当局为了大批逮捕华侨，设立了很多特务机关，仅新加坡一地，即增设了机构庞大的南北两个所谓“罪犯调查区”，并普遍地扩充囚禁我华侨的集中营。如新山集中营“在扩充后可多容一千被捕者”。四排坡监狱“一个屋子就关了二百多人，有十来岁的小孩，有七八十岁的老头子”，“每一餐只有很小的一团饭吃”。华侨所遭受的酷刑拷打、敲诈、强奸，更是罄竹难书。英国议员哈维最近且公然声称：“我们无论如何得把这些被扣留者赶出马来亚。”
    大规模地驱逐华侨出马来亚，乃是英国政府久已进行的、而最近更加紧进行的计划。马来亚英国殖民地当局决心将我国侨胞分批驱逐出马来亚。自去年十一月以来，已有四批侨胞共二千八百一十三人，相继被逐返抵祖国。第五批现已在路上，第六和七批均可能随时被逐。马来亚英国殖民地当局在驱逐我侨胞出境时，又强迫被捕华侨填写所谓“自愿出境申请书”，企图借此掩盖其非法驱逐我侨胞的真相。至于马来亚英国殖民地当局在各种借口之下搜查华侨学校、修改返回马来亚的签证的办法，轰炸华侨村庄、实行“集体惩罚”、强征壮丁、制造“死地”等种种骇人听闻的血腥事件，更是层出不穷。
    中国人民对于马来亚英国殖民地当局的这种不法罪行，无不义愤填膺，且决不能坐视不顾。大家都知道，马来亚之有今日，乃是二百八十万华侨和当地人民辛勤劳动的结果。第二次大战爆发后，日本侵占马来亚，英国军队不战而降。在四年沦陷期间，对日本侵略军队坚决进行抗战的，也是华侨和当地劳动人民。而今天，马来亚英国殖民地当局竟以法西斯的残酷手段对待我华侨。
    中国人民密切地关心马来亚华侨在英国殖民地当局残酷迫害下所造成的严重情况。同时，我们相信，这也是全世界一切主持正义与人道的人士所严重注意和关切的。我国各慈善团体及各人民团体基于此一立场，接受北京归国华侨在“反对美国武装日本示威游行大会”的建议，共同组织了中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会，并决定派调查团前赴马来亚各地，调查我国侨胞受难的实际情况，以便向我国人民与关心此一问题的世界各国人士提出真实的报告书。
    调查团不久即将出发赴马来亚执行任务，并准备随时将调查报告，提供给关心这一问题的国内外各界人士。我们希望全国与全世界一切主持正义与人道的人士，大力支持我们这一正义的行动。
