Comrades, sisters! Friends!

　　Today I am extremely excited to be able to celebrate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day with sisters from all walks of life in the capital, as well as international friends staying in our capital.

　　The significance of commemorating the "March 8th" festival this year, as pointed out by the International Democratic Women's Federation, is to make this year's "March 8th" activities a powerful demonstration of the will of the broadest masses of women in various countries to defend peace. In other words, to enable women around the world who love peace to unite most broadly through "March 8th" activities, and to review their strength in opposing aggressive war and striving for world peace in various scales and forms. Undoubtedly, this significance is very important.

　　We—the women of New China—are commemorating this year's "March 8th" festival and reviewing our strength on an unprecedented scale with ardent enthusiasm for loving the motherland and defending peace under this overall call and goal.

　　　　Women Actively Participate in Political Power and Production Construction

　　Looking back since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a broad road has been opened up for the liberation of Chinese women. Many women have participated in political organs at all levels, learning the skills of managing the country; women account for a greater proportion in grassroots political power. For example, in the nine districts of Beijing, there are 1,422 street representatives, accounting for more than 21% of the total number of street representatives in the city, and there are 232 female district representatives, accounting for more than 19% of the total number of district representatives in the city. In the recent Beijing People's Representative Conference, three government members were elected. There are also female bureau chiefs, female district heads, female public security sub-bureau chiefs, female police station chiefs, etc. In the township-level political power of the thirteen counties in Xuchang Prefecture, there are more than 1,000 female cadres from peasant backgrounds, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of township committee members in the prefecture; even in some rural political powers that have been liberated not long ago, many female district heads and a large number of female township heads and female village heads have emerged. In the cities, many female workers have also been elected to participate in political organs.

　　In terms of economic construction, tens of millions of women have participated in various productions such as agriculture, industry, and handicrafts. According to statistics from 28 counties in 16 provinces in North China, Northeast China, Central South China, and Northwest China, more than 3.44 million women participated in spring plowing production last year. In addition, many women participated in large-scale water conservancy construction projects. For example, 650,000 women participated in the repair and guidance projects of the Grand Canal, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Yi River last year. In the industrial field, female workers have made great contributions. Last year, in Northeast China alone, there were 1,849 female workers who created new records; in three factories in Jinan, 297 female workers were elected as first-class labor models, accounting for more than 58% of the 507 first-class labor models. The long-distance station team of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, led by Li Tianrui's group, only had one error in 16,530 calls, breaking the record. Zhang Qi of the Electric Power Bureau improved the charging method, saving the country 299,400 catties of millet, and also contributed to the charging methods in the national electric power sector. Many female workers have also begun to attach importance to learning technology and improving work methods; and among female workers, it has been proposed that learning technology should be the direction of future efforts. Some have opened up new career paths for women, such as train drivers, tram drivers, train attendant crews, factory maintenance workers, etc.

　　In addition, many women are working hard to improve their education. 94% of female workers in Dalian and Lushun have participated in spare-time learning organizations. Some female workers have gone from being illiterate to recognizing 3,000 characters in a year. A large number of illiterate women in various places are being widely absorbed into workers' spare-time schools and farmers' spare-time schools, as well as various learning organizations and training courses to learn. Women have also demonstrated their abilities in cultural and educational work, maternal and child health, and childcare. Many labor models and outstanding workers have emerged in various work positions. For example, when the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions selected labor models at the end of January the year before last, there was only one female model. By the time of the "March 8th" selection this year, the number had increased to 155 models and 12 collective models, and the standards had also been raised compared to last year. These models include model female workers, model family members of employees, and model female workers.

　　　　The People's Government Guarantees Women's Democratic Rights Everywhere

　　These facts are exciting. The achievements are mainly due to the increased political awareness of women after liberation, the changed labor concept, the result of hard work in production, hard work, and hard study; at the same time, it is also due to the concern, encouragement, and concrete help of the People's Government for the women's liberation movement. In order to realize the program of equality between men and women and protect the interests of women and children, the Central People's Government promulgated the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China on May 1st last year, breaking the marriage system that had caused deep disasters for women for thousands of years, and produced many new-style married couples. In Jiaodong alone, in the two months at the end of last year, more than 3,000 couples appeared who were married in accordance with the new Marriage Law.

　　The Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, promulgated by the Central People's Government in June last year, stipulates that the principle of land distribution based on population fully conforms to the spirit of equality between men and women. In the areas where land reform was implemented last winter and this spring, women in vast peasant families improved their class consciousness, joined peasant associations, and actively participated in land reform work. In East China alone, the number of female members of peasant associations reached more than 30 million. According to statistics from Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces in Central South China, the number of female members of peasant associations also reached more than 5 million. According to statistics from East China and Central South China, about 60 million women obtained the same share of land as men last winter and this spring; and with the abolition of the feudal land system, the feudal traditional customs that bound women also lost the social basis for their existence; the new morality of equality between men and women is growing in the rural areas after land reform.

　　Recently, the State Council also promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China. These regulations not only implement the spirit of equality between men and women, but also provide special protection based on the current situation of female employees. As a female worker from Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill said when discussing the draft regulations: "Having a son may not necessarily provide for old age; with these regulations, there is a guarantee for birth, old age, sickness, and death, which is even better than a biological son."

　　Now, many mothers engaged in physical and mental labor have also begun to send their beloved young children to childcare institutions to receive reasonable education. The number of public and private nurseries across the country is growing, reaching 975 according to recent incomplete statistics, accommodating 38,520 children, more than three times the total number in 1949.

　　All this shows that we have a very good start to actively participate in the various constructions of New China, to continue to create a better life, and to seek our own complete liberation.

　　　　Chinese Women Resolutely Defend Peace and Resist America, Aid Korea

　　However, just as we are actively building in the peaceful land, just as we are following in the footsteps of Soviet sisters, joining hands with women from people's democratic countries and sisters who love peace and democracy all over the world, the US imperialists have ignited the flames of aggressive war, occupied our territory of Taiwan, and invaded our neighbor, Korea. Although today it has suffered serious blows from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it has not learned the lessons it should have learned from this, and is still immersed in the frenzy of war. It is unlimitedly expanding its military budget, barbarously attempting to arm Japan and West Germany, and accelerating the manufacture and expansion of war. These warmongers want to drag the peace-loving people and women all over the world into the abyss of war again, just like what US imperialism is doing on the Korean battlefield now; what a serious threat to the peace-loving people, especially women and children! What an intolerable fact!

　　We firmly believe that the world peace force led by the Soviet Union is powerful, and is making every effort to stop the imperialist war of aggression. Marshal Stalin taught us: "What will be the result of this struggle between the forces of aggression and the forces of peace? If the people of all countries take up the cause of defending peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people in a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable." Sisters! Friends! We must mobilize urgently and, together with the peace-loving people all over the world, use all our strength to strive for peace and defend peace.

　　Recently, the first session of the World Peace Council was successfully concluded in Berlin. This conference, representing the will of all peace-loving people in the world, thoroughly exposed the shameful face of the United Nations as an instrument of aggression, clearly pointed out the direction of our struggle for peace, and adopted the declaration on the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact, as well as other important resolutions. This is a new action program for peace-loving people all over the world. We warmly support it, and are willing to unite closely with the people in Asia and the world who uphold the cause of peace with the greatest determination and perseverance, and strive to the end to realize these declarations and resolutions and to strive for lasting world peace.

　　We Chinese women have suffered from the ravages of imperialist wars of aggression for a long time, and the pain still remains. Now that US imperialism has launched and expanded aggressive wars, we are the first to bear the brunt. In order to defend our homes and defend our country, in order to protect the fruits of our revolutionary victory, we have been widely mobilized in the past five months to participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea. In the patriotic production competition, in rural production, land reform, and payment of public grain, in propaganda and learning about current affairs, in raising political awareness, in the universal and enthusiastic development of comfort work, in bravely participating in the work of field medical teams and applying for military cadre schools, women across the country, together with the people of the whole country, have contributed their strength, supported the victory of the front line, improved their awareness, strengthened internal unity, expanded women's contacts and organization, and consolidated the rear of the People's Volunteers.

　　Especially recently, since the movement against US imperialism's rearmament of Japan, and in the commemorative activities surrounding the "March 8th" festival, nearly 20 large and medium-sized cities in the five regions of Northeast China, North China, East China, Central South China, and Southwest China have successively held marches and demonstrations by women. It has concentratedly demonstrated the power of women from all classes, parties, industries, and religions to love the motherland and defend peace. In particular, it has united the vast number of housewives, enabling them to take to the streets and openly and clearly express their will to defend peace, which is not easy. This is also the most important thing in expanding and deepening the movement to resist America, aid Korea.

　　For example: when you see an old lady with white hair, who almost needs someone to help her walk, but she is holding a small flag in the marching team and shouting excitedly: "Educate children to love the motherland", "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live," can you not be moved? When you see in the marching team that there is a team of nuns and bhikkhunis who have always lived in seclusion, and they are also shouting "Oppose US imperialism's rearmament of Japan," can you not feel how great and profound the movement to resist America, aid Korea is?

　　Yes, the patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea has further awakened and united Chinese women.

　　　　Expand the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea and Oppose the Armament of Japan

　　Today, on this day of reviewing women's power, on this day of fighting to defend peace, we should put forward the slogan of "further expanding and deepening the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the rearmament of Japan." In the future, we must truly ensure that every place and every woman voluntarily and consciously joins this great movement. Contribute their strength in various positions. Use greater strength to eliminate the influence and forces of imperialism in all aspects. Use greater strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who are bravely fighting and working hard on the front lines in Korea, and to sympathize with and help our neighbors and friends—Korean sisters and Korean children, and use practical actions to respond to the recent call of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League. Persist in implementing our patriotic pact with regular work.

　　We should also strengthen ties with women in various Asian countries, and work together with them, especially with Japanese women, to speed up the realization of a just and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, closely cooperate with the European people's movement against the rearmament of West Germany, and completely smash the warmongers' evil plan to expand aggression, and strive for lasting world peace.

　　Let us follow the direction of efforts pointed out by the five national people's organizations in the joint notice issued for the commemoration of the "March 8th" International Women's Day. We must work hard from various positions and with different efforts towards a common goal—to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes and defend our country, and defend world peace!

　　Sisters from all walks of life in the capital! In the past, whether in the construction work of the new capital, in the peace signature movement, or in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, you have made great efforts, achieved many achievements, created many model examples, and gained some experience. For example, in the peace signature movement, Aunt Gao and Aunt Zhang collected more than 8,000 signatures in a week, and their spirit of working hard for peace and their method of following the mass line are even more worthy of learning and promotion. In the future, I hope you will work harder to deepen and expand the movement to resist America, aid Korea, to realize your participation in the patriotic pact, and to work harder to build a beautiful new capital.

　　Finally, let us shout:

　　Support and implement the ten great resolutions of the World Peace Council!

　　Women who love peace all over the world unite!

　　Long live the liberation of Chinese women!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Communist Party of China!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

### 热爱祖国、保卫和平——中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅在首都各界纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上的讲话

　　热爱祖国、保卫和平
    ——中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅在首都各界纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上的讲话亲爱的姊妹们！朋友们！
    今天我能和首都各界姊妹们，以及留住我国首都的各位国际朋友们，来一道庆祝今年的“三八”国际妇女节，我感到异常兴奋。
    今年纪念“三八”节的意义，正如国际民主妇联指出的，要使今年纪念“三八”的活动，成为世界各国最广泛的妇女群众保卫和平的意志的强大示威。也就是说，要使全世界爱好和平的妇女们，通过“三八”的活动，最广泛的团结起来，采用各种不同的规模与形式，来检阅自己反对侵略战争，争取世界和平的力量。无疑的，这个意义是很重大的。
    我们——新中国的妇女，就是在这个总的号召与目标之下，以热爱祖国，保卫和平的热烈情绪，以前所未有的规模，来纪念今年的“三八”节，来检阅自己的力量。
            妇女积极参加政权和生产建设
    回溯自中华人民共和国成立以来，已为中国妇女的解放开辟了宽广的道路，不少妇女参加了各级政权机构，学习管理国家的本领；在基层政权中，妇女所占的比例更多。例如北京市九个区就有街代表一千四百二十二人，占全市街代表总人数百分之二十一强，区代表女的共有二百三十二人，占全市区代表总数百分之十九强。在最近的北京市人民代表会议中，选出了三个政府委员。其他还有女局长，女区长，女公安分局长，女派出所长等。许昌专区十三个县的乡级政权内，农民出身的女干部有一千余名，占该专区的乡政委员总数的三分之一以上；甚至解放不久的一些农村政权中，也出现了不少的女区长和大批的女乡长和女村长。在城市中，女工被选参加政权机构的也不少。
    在经济建设方面，成千万的妇女参加了农业、工业、手工业等各种生产。根据华北、东北、中南、西北四个行政区的十六个省中，二十八个县的统计，去年参加春耕生产的妇女达三百四十四万余人。此外，还有不少妇女参加了规模宏大的水利建设工程，如去年参加运河、长江、黄河及沂河修导工程的妇女，就有六十五万。在工业方面，女工是有很大贡献的，去年东北一地，创造了新纪录的女工计一千八百四十九人；济南三个工厂中，女工当选头等劳动模范的有二百九十七人，占全部头等劳动模范五百零七人的百分之五十八强。北京市电讯局李天瑞小组负责的长途台各地台组在一万六千五百三十个电话中才有一个差错，打破了纪录。电业局的张琪，改进了收费办法，替国家节省了二十九万九千四百斤小米，并对全国电业方面的收费法亦有贡献。还有不少女工已开始重视学习技术，改进劳作法；并且在女工中，已提出将学习技术作为今后努力的方向。有的已为妇女开辟了新职业的途径，如火车司机、电车司机、火车包乘组、工厂保全工等等。
    此外，更有不少妇女正在努力提高文化，旅大女工中有百分之九十四参加了业余学习组织，有的女工，一年中从不识字到识三千字。各地大批妇女文盲，正被广泛吸收到工人业余学校和农民业余学校以及各种学习组织、训练班中去学习。在文化教育工作、妇婴卫生、儿童保育等工作方面，妇女也显示了自己的能力。在各种工作岗位上，且都涌现了不少劳动模范和优秀工作者。例如：天津市总工会，前年一月底评选劳动模范时，尚只有一个女的，到今年“三八”节评选时，已增加到一百五十五个模范和十二个集体模范，而标准也都比去年提高了，这些模范中，包括着模范女工，模范职工家属和女模范工作者在内。
            人民政府处处保障妇女民主权利
    这些事实，是令人兴奋的。这些成绩的获得，首先是由于解放后的妇女政治觉悟提高了，劳动观点改变了，努力生产，努力工作，努力学习的结果；同时也是由于人民政府对妇女解放运动的关心，鼓励和具体帮助的结果。中央人民政府为着实现男女平等、保护妇女、儿童利益的纲领，已在去年五月一日颁布了中华人民共和国婚姻法，打破了几千年来给予妇女深重灾难的婚姻制度，产生了不少新式结婚的夫妇，仅胶东一地在去年年底的两个月中，就出现了三千余对男女，按照新婚姻法而结合的婚姻。
    去年六月中央人民政府公布的中华人民共和国土地改革法，规定按人口分配土地的原则，完全符合男女平等的精神。在去冬今春实行土地改革的地区，广大农民家庭中的妇女，提高了阶级觉悟，加入了农会，积极参加土地改革的工作，仅华东一区，农会女会员已达三千余万人。中南区的湖南、湖北、河南三省统计，农会女会员，也达五百余万。据华东中南的统计，去冬今春约有六千余万妇女获得了和男子同样的一份土地；而且随着封建土地制度的废除，束缚妇女的封建传统习俗，也失掉了存在的社会基础；男女平等的新道德，正在土地改革后的农村中生长起来。
    最近政务院又公布了中华人民共和国劳动保险条例。这个条例，不仅贯彻了男女平等的精神，而且根据当前女职工的状况，给予特殊的保护。正如上海棉纺一厂一位女工，在讨论该条例草案时说：“生了一个儿子，还不一定能够防老；有了这个条例，不论生、老、病、死，都有了保障，真比亲生子还好。”
    现在，许多从事体力劳动、脑力劳动的母亲们，也开始能将自己心爱的幼小的儿女，送到保育机关去，受到合理的教养。全国公私立托儿所已在日益发展，据最近不完全的统计，已达九百七十五处，收托儿童达三万八千五百二十人，超过一九四九年总数三倍以上。
    这一切，说明我们有了一个多么良好的开端，来积极参加新中国的各项建设，来继续创造更美好的生活，与求得自身的彻底解放。
            我国妇女坚决保卫和平抗美援朝
    但是，正当我们在和平的国土上积极建设的时候，正当我们追随着苏联姊妹之后，与各人民民主国家妇女及全世界爱好和平民主的姊妹，携手共进的时候，美帝国主义者燃起了侵略战争的火焰，侵占了我们的领土台湾，侵略了我们的邻邦朝鲜。虽然今天它已遭受了朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军给予他的严重打击，但是它没有从这里获得应有的教训，仍然沉浸在战争的狂热中。在无限制地扩大军事预算，蛮横地企图武装日本和西德，加速地制造与扩大战争。这些战争贩子们想把全世界爱好和平的人民与妇女，再拖入战争的火坑中，正像美帝国主义现在在朝鲜战场上所做的一样；这对于爱好和平的人民，特别对妇女儿童，是何等严重的威胁？！是何等不能容忍的事实？！
    我们深信，全世界以苏联为首的世界和平力量是强大的，正在用一切努力制止帝国主义的侵略战争。斯大林大元帅教导了我们：“侵略势力和爱好和平的力量之间的这一斗争，会有怎样的结果呢？如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民拖入另一次世界大战之中，那么战争就可能变得不可避免。”姊妹们！朋友们！我们一定要紧急地动员起来，和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，用一切的力量来争取和平，保卫和平。
    最近世界和平理事会第一届会议，已在柏林胜利闭幕。这个会议，代表全世界一切爱好和平人民的意志，彻底揭露了联合国已成为侵略工具的可耻面目，明确指出了我们争取和平的斗争方向，通过了关于缔结五国和平公约的宣言，以及其他重要的决议。这是全世界爱好和平人民的新的行动纲领。我们热烈拥护，而且愿以最大的决心和毅力，与全亚洲、全世界维护和平事业的人们紧密团结起来，为实现这些宣言决议，为争取世界持久和平而奋斗到底。
    我们中国妇女，长期遭受帝国主义侵略战争的蹂躏，创痛犹存，现在美帝国主义发动和扩大侵略战争，我们又首当其冲。为着保家卫国，为着保护我们革命胜利的果实，在过去的五个月中，我们已经广泛地发动起来，参加了抗美援朝运动。在爱国主义生产竞赛中，在农村生产、土地改革、缴纳公粮中，在宣传和学习时事，提高政治觉悟上，在普遍、热烈地展开的慰劳工作上，在英勇地参加战地医疗队的工作和投考军事干部学校方面，全国妇女，都和全国人民一起，贡献了自己的力量，支援了前线的胜利，提高了自己的觉悟，加强了内部的团结，扩大了妇女的联系与组织，巩固了人民志愿军的后方。
    特别最近，自反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的运动以来，和在围绕“三八”节的纪念活动中，东北、华北、华东、中南、西南五个区中已有近二十个大、中城市先后举行了妇女界的游行示威。将各阶层、各党派、各行各业、各种宗教信仰的妇女热爱祖国、保卫和平的力量，作了集中表现。特别是团结了广大的家庭妇女，使他们也能走上街头，公开而明确地表示自己保卫和平的意志，这是很不容易的，这也是扩大深入抗美援朝运动中最要紧的。
    譬如：当你看到一个白发老太太，差不多走路都要人搀扶了，但是她在游行队伍中，拿着一面小旗，兴奋地高叫着：“教育子女，热爱祖国”，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁”时，你能不受感动吗？当你看到游行队伍中，有一队是一向深居简出的修女、尼姑们，她们也高叫着“反对美帝国主义重新武装日本”时，你能不感到抗美援朝运动是如何的伟大与深入吗？
    是的，抗美援朝爱国主义运动，使我国妇女进一步地觉悟与团结起来了。
            扩大抗美援朝反对武装日本运动
    今天，在这个检阅妇女力量的日子，在为保卫和平而斗争的日子，我们应该提出“更进一步扩大和深入抗美援朝，反对重新武装日本的运动”这一口号。今后要真正作到每一个地方，每一个妇女，都自愿自觉地加入这个伟大的运动。在各种不同的岗位上，贡献自己的力量。用更大的力量，在各方面来肃清帝国主义的影响与帝国主义的势力。用更大的力量来支援正在朝鲜前线英勇作战、艰苦奋斗的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，更多地同情和帮助我们邻国的朋友——朝鲜姊妹和朝鲜的孩子们，用实际的行动来回答最近朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会的呼吁。用经常的工作来坚持实现我们的爱国公约。
    我们还应该加强与各亚洲国家妇女们的联系，要和她们一道，特别是与日本妇女一道，加紧争取对日缔结公正的全面的和约早日实现，密切配合欧洲人民反对重新武装西德的运动，来彻底粉碎战争贩子扩大侵略的罪恶计划，争取世界持久和平。
    让我们遵循今年五个全国性的人民团体，为纪念“三八”国际妇女节所发布的联合通知中指出的全国妇女和各界妇女努力的方向，我们要从各个不同的岗位，用不同的努力，向一个总的目标——抗美援朝、保家卫国，和保卫世界和平，努力奋斗！
    首都各界的姊妹们！你们过去不论在新首都的建设工作中，在和平签名运动中，在抗美援朝运动中，都作了很大的努力，做出了很多的成绩，创造了不少模范事例，获得了一些经验。如和平签名运动中高大娘、张大娘一星期中征得八千多个签名者，而她们为和平而努力的精神与其走群众路线的办法，更是值得学习和推广。今后希望你们更加努力，为深入扩大抗美援朝运动，为现实自己参加订定的爱国公约，为建设美好的新首都而更加紧工作。
    最后，让我们高呼：
    拥护并实现世界和平理事会的十项伟大决议！
    全世界爱好和平的妇女团结起来！
    中国妇女解放万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
                                     （文内小题是本报编者所加）
