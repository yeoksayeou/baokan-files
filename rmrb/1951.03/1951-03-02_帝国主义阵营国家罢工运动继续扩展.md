　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Strike movements triggered by rising living costs due to military expansion and war preparations are continuing to develop in several countries of the imperialist camp.

　　London dockworkers staged their second strike in two weeks on February 27th. Workers angrily protested against the Labor government's persecution of the leaders of the British dock strike that broke out in early February, using the wartime anti-strike decree - Article 1305. Eight thousand dockworkers stopped work to express their active support for the seven leaders who appeared in court that day. The railway workers' strike and slowdown movement, which had caused the Labor government considerable embarrassment, has temporarily ended because the state-owned railway authorities finally agreed to increase wages by 7.5%. However, this increase has not fully met the demands of the workers, and strong dissatisfaction is still widespread among the workers.

　　In Paris, 32,000 bus and subway drivers held a 24-hour strike on February 26th. Workers belonging to three different unions, including the French General Confederation of Labor, the Catholic Labor League, and "Workers' Force," acted in unison, demanding an increase of 6,000 francs per month in wages. The strike brought all 2,200 buses in Paris to a standstill, and only 16 of the more than 400 subway cars were running.

　　In Australia, the one-day-a-week strike by coal miners in protest against unreasonable wage rulings is continuing. Miners in the northern coalfields of New South Wales held a meeting on February 26th, firmly expressing their determination to carry the strike through to the end. The reactionary Australian government is attempting to persecute strike leaders.

　　In New Zealand, the national dockworkers, who began their strike on February 19th, disregarded the authorities' declaration of a national emergency and the implementation of high-pressure policies. On the 26th, they rejected Labor Minister Sullivan's order to threaten a return to work and decided to continue the strike until their wage and working hour demands were resolved. According to a Reuters Auckland dispatch on the 27th, more than 1,000 power workers also went on strike in support of the dockworkers, further exacerbating New Zealand's industrial crisis.

　　帝国主义阵营国家罢工运动继续扩展
    【新华社一日讯】由于扩军备战使生活费用上涨而在帝国主义阵营的若干国家内爆发的罢工运动，正在继续发展中。
    伦敦码头工人于二月二十七日举行两周来的第二次罢工。工人们愤怒地抗议工党政府假借战时反罢工法令——一三○五条法令，迫害二月初爆发的英国码头大罢工的领袖。八千码头工人停止工作，对当日出庭受审的七名领袖表示积极声援。曾使工党政府狼狈周章的铁路工人罢工和怠工运动，虽已因国营铁路当局最后答应增加百分之七点五的工资而暂告结束。但是，这一增加并未完全满足工人们所提出的要求，工人中间仍普遍存在着强烈的不满。
    在巴黎，三万二千名公共汽车和地下电车司机于二月二十六日举行二十四小时罢工。隶属于法国总工会、天主教劳工联盟和“工人力量”等三个不同的工会的工人们，一致行动，要求增加每月工资六千法郎。罢工使巴黎二千二百辆公共汽车全部停开，四百多辆地下电车中只有十六辆行驶。
    在澳大利亚，煤矿工人为抗议不合理的工资裁决而举行的每周一日的罢工仍在继续中。新南威尔士北部煤田区的矿工于二月二十六日举行大会，坚决表示将罢工进行到底。澳大利亚反动政府正企图迫害罢工领袖。
    在新西兰，二月十九日开始罢工的全国码头工人，不顾当局宣布全国紧急状态和实行高压政策，在二十六日拒绝了劳工部长苏利万威胁复工的命令，并决定在工资和工作时间的要求未获解决以前继续罢工。据路透社奥克兰二十七日消息，一千多电力工人也罢工支援码头工人，从而使新西兰的工业危机更加恶化。
