    Viciously Insulting the Workers

To the Editor:

    I was extremely indignant after reading about the case of Guo Yueyu, a doctor at the Yihua Textile Factory in the Fengfeng Mining Area of Hebei Province, who raped 15-year-old female worker Lian Jiping, which was published in your newspaper on March 4th. I believe that Guo Yueyu not only committed the crimes of raping a minor, forced abortion, and falsely accusing the victim, but more seriously, he does not take workers seriously and thinks he can do whatever he wants to workers as in the old society. His false accusation of Lian Haokun and his daughter of adultery is an extremely vicious insult to the working class, which is intolerable. The original sentence of two and a half years imprisonment given to him by the People's Court of the Mining Area Government is too light. I think he should be sentenced to at least ten years imprisonment.

    Factory Director Hao Cheng should not only be removed from his current position but also be given a strict disciplinary warning within the Party and have his work reviewed.

    The trade union is the workers' own organization and should wholeheartedly work for the benefit of the workers. However, the chairman and vice-chairman of the factory's trade union, Yu Gaoxiang and Liu Jinfu, are so detached from the masses that they neither fought against the factory director's shielding of Guo and the dismissal of Lian Jiping, nor did they suggest improvements regarding Lian Jiping's 60-li round trip to the Mining Area People's Government for trial while ill. Therefore, I believe that their removal from their positions is justified.

    Finally, I express my sympathy and condolences to Comrade Lian Jiping. I hope she takes good care of herself, recovers her health soon, and works more actively in the future. I don't think Comrade Lian Jiping should have any "shameful" thoughts; it is Guo Yueyu and his ilk who should be ashamed. Today, the working class is liberated, and you should bravely stand up and fight against all old ideas and old ways of working. Everyone sympathizes with you and supports you.
                                     A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Feng Pei

### 极恶毒地侮辱了工人

    极恶毒地侮辱了工人编辑同志：
    三月四日贵报登载河北省峰峰矿区益华纱厂医生郭月宇强奸十五岁女工连吉平一事，读后我非常愤恨。我觉得郭月宇不但犯了强奸未成年女子、强迫坠胎和反口诬告的罪行，同时更严重的是他不把工人放在眼内，以为还可以像在旧社会里那样，对工人胡作非为。从他诬告连好坤父女通奸这件事来看，这是对工人阶级极为恶毒的侮辱，这是不能容忍的事情。矿区人民政府法院原判他二年半徒刑，实在太轻了，我以为起码要判徒刑十年以上。
    厂长郝诚除撤消其现行职务外，应在党内给予严格的处分，并检查其工作。
    工会是工人自己的组织，应该全心全意为工人谋福利。但是该厂工会正副主任郁高翔、刘金富却这样脱离群众，对厂长包庇郭犯和开除连吉平事件既不进行斗争；对连吉平带病往返六十里地到矿区人民政府受审事，也不提出改善意见。因此，我认为撤消他们的职务是应该的。
    最后，我向连吉平同志表示同情和慰问。希望她好好休养，早日恢复健康，今后更积极地工作。我认为连吉平同志不应该有什么“丢人”的想法；丢人的是郭月宇他们。今天工人阶级解放了，你应该勇敢地站起来和一切旧意识旧作风作斗争。大家都同情你，支持你。
