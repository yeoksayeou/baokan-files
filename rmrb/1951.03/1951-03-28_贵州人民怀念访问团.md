　　Guizhou People Cherish the Visiting Delegation
　　Shi Lin
　　"Goodbye, comrades,
　　Although it is a happy farewell,
　　My heart cannot help but be reluctant to part."
　　This is the first verse of the farewell song at the farewell party before the Third Branch of the Central Visiting Delegation left Guizhou. It expresses the heartfelt sentiments of the people of Guizhou, especially the minority ethnic compatriots.
　　During the last period of the visiting delegation's stay in Guizhou, we all hoped that the days would pass slowly. The provincial and municipal leading organs and the visiting delegation hosted banquets for each other, people laughed, and applauded enthusiastically. At the farewell parties of all circles, representatives of minority ethnic groups presented flowers to the leaders of the visiting delegation.
　　When the people of Guizhou heard the news that the Central Visiting Delegation was coming to Guizhou, everyone was overjoyed and immediately prepared a grand welcome meeting. In Mengguan Township, forty miles away from Guiyang, the Miao and Yi compatriots also quickly organized a welcoming team. The men carried lushengs, leather drums, xiao flutes, and other musical instruments, and the women wore their most beautiful colorful skirts and their most precious jewelry, happily walking to Guiyang to welcome the visiting delegation. More than a dozen villages, including Henan Village, Airport, Chaoyang Cave, Shuikousi, and Baizhuang, also brought the old and the young to welcome "the people sent by Chairman Mao."
　　The arrival of the Central Visiting Delegation brought the cordial concern of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to all ethnic groups, and also brought joy.
　　When the comrades of the visiting delegation arrived in Huaxi, more than 9,000 people from all over came to welcome them, including those who came from Huishui, hundreds of miles away; and when they left Liujiazhai in Mengguan, three young girls tightly held the hands of the female comrades of the visiting delegation, walking from this village to that village, singing joyful songs all the way.
　　Mountains could not stop the footsteps of the visiting delegation comrades, and rain could not stop their enthusiasm. The comrades of the visiting delegation once climbed over two mountain ridges to reach Yangjiazhai, where Miao and Yi compatriots lived; in the rain, they climbed the muddy path in the mountains to Wangjiachong; another rainy day, they carried a film-projecting generator and did not arrive at Dazhai in Huangpiao until 2:00 a.m. In the severe winter, the fog froze into ice more than an inch thick on the highway, and the water on the eaves formed silver columns, as the visiting delegation comrades came to this Guizhou northwest plateau, three thousand meters above sea level. Ridge after ridge, village after village, the comrades of the visiting delegation's service team treated minority ethnic compatriots—not only treating their wounded bodies, but also healing their wounded hearts.
　　How could every minority ethnic group not be excited! Now, they have been freed from heavy shackles and have gained ethnic equality. Thinking of the past, their eyes turn red. From the fourth year of Yongzheng to the first year of Qianlong, and from the year of Yimao in Xianfeng to the eleventh year of Tongzhi, the people of minority ethnic groups, with infinite anger, launched struggles of resistance against the rulers, which were finally suppressed by the ruling class, and the happy life they had worked hard to create was brutally destroyed. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, their lives were even more miserable.
　　Now, although the Central Visiting Delegation has left, they have left an indelible memory in people's hearts.

### 贵州人民怀念访问团

　　贵州人民怀念访问团
    石林
    “再见了，同志们，
    虽然是愉快地告别
    心里却不免依依留恋。”
    这是中央访问团第三分团离贵州前，在告别晚会上的告别歌的首段歌词。它说出了贵州人民，尤其是贵州少数民族同胞的心声。
    在访问团留贵州的最后一段时期内，我们都希望日子慢慢地走过。省和市的领导机关和访问团互相欢宴，人们在欢笑，在热烈地鼓掌。在各界欢送晚会上，少数民族代表向访问团各首长献了鲜花。
    当贵州人民听到中央访问团即将来贵州的消息时，大家欢欣鼓舞，立即准备盛大的欢迎会。在距贵阳四十里路的孟关乡，苗彝同胞也连忙组织了欢迎的队伍。男人们携带着芦笙、皮鼓、箫、笛等乐器，女人们穿上最美丽的彩裙，戴上最珍贵的首饰，高兴地步行到贵阳来欢迎访问团。河南庄、飞机场、朝阳洞、水口寺、白庄……等十几个村子的苗胞也扶老携幼地迎接“毛主席派来的人”。
    中央访问团的来临，带来了毛主席和中央人民政府对各族人民的亲切关怀，也给带来了喜悦。
    当访问团同志抵达花溪时，各地赶来欢迎的达九千余人，其中还有从百里外的惠水赶来的；而当他们离开孟关刘家寨时，三位年青姑娘紧紧地拉着访问团女同志的手，从这个寨子走到那个寨子，一路上唱着愉快的歌子。
    山挡不住访问团同志的脚，雨也阻遏不了他们的热情。访问团同志曾翻过两座山岭到达住着苗彝同胞的杨家寨；在雨天他们爬过山岭中泥泞不堪的小道来到王家冲；另一个雨天，他们抬着放映电影的发电机在午夜二时才到黄飘的大寨。在严寒的冬天，雾在公路上冻成寸多厚的冰，屋檐上的水结成一根根的水银柱，访问团同志来到这拔海三千公尺的贵州西北高原。一岭又一岭，一村又一村，访问团服务组同志为少数民族同胞治疗——不但为他们治疗了创伤的身体，更治疗着他们受了创伤的心。
    每一个少数民族的人民怎能不兴奋！现在，他们解脱了沉重的枷锁，获得了民族平等。一想到过去，他们的眼睛就红润了。雍正四年到乾隆元年，咸丰乙卯年到同治十一年，少数民族的人民曾带着无限的愤怒，向统治者掀起了反抗斗争，终于为统治阶级所镇压，他们辛勤创造的幸福生活惨遭破坏。在国民党反动派统治时期，他们的生活更是惨苦。
    现在，中央访问团虽然已经走了，然而，他们在人们的心里留下了永不磨灭的记忆。
