　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Four-Power Assistant Foreign Ministers' meeting continued on March 21st, chaired by the Soviet representative, Gromyko.

　　At the previous meeting, the Soviet delegation had presented new wording on a proposal concerning the reduction of the four powers' armed forces. At this meeting, the Western Three Powers' representatives did not express a clear attitude towards the Soviet proposal. The French representative, Parrot, repeatedly attempted to replace the clear and specific proposal regarding the reduction of the four powers' armed forces with vague wording about "levels of armaments." The British representative, Davies, stated that the Soviet's new proposal "cannot serve as a basis for agreement."

　　In his speech, the Soviet representative Gromyko accused the U.S. representative Jessup of deliberately distorting the meaning of the Soviet proposal. He pointed out that the reason the Western Three Powers repeatedly indicated that including the elimination of German militarism and the reduction of the four powers' armed forces on the agenda would essentially predetermine decisions on these issues, was to deceive public opinion and prevent people from understanding the true meaning of the Soviet proposal.

　　After Gromyko finished speaking, the meeting adjourned.

　　On March 23rd, the Four-Power Assistant Foreign Ministers held a closed-door meeting. However, the meeting did nothing to change the situation regarding the preparation of the agenda, because the Three Powers were still unwilling to compromise with the Soviet proposals. They reiterated their old arguments, insisting on only including the Three Powers' proposals and refusing to include the urgent and critical issues proposed by the Soviet delegation—implementing the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and reducing the four powers' armed forces.

　　On March 24th, the Four-Power Assistant Foreign Ministers' meeting continued, chaired by the French representative, Parrot.

　　At the meeting, the Western Three Powers tried their best to avoid discussing the main agenda items—reducing the four powers' armed forces and implementing the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism. The U.S. representative, Jessup, and the British representative, Davies, once again raised the issue of the Austrian peace treaty and opposed including the issue of implementing the Trieste clauses of the Italian peace treaty on the agenda.

　　In his speech, the Soviet representative, Gromyko, pointed out that many facts prove that it is the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that are delaying the preparation of the Austrian peace treaty. The Soviet representative suggested genuinely implementing the principles of the Moscow Declaration on the Austrian issue and implementing other agreements of the four powers, but these suggestions were immediately opposed by the representatives of the Three Powers.

　　Gromyko continued: The Soviet delegation still insists on including the implementation of the Trieste part of the Italian peace treaty as a separate item on the agenda. Because as a result of the Western Three Powers illegally turning Trieste into a U.S.-British military base, the Italian peace treaty has been violated.

　　Gromyko then refuted the implication of the Three Powers in proposing to study "levels of armaments" that the Soviet army seemed to be excessively large. Gromyko pointed out: A few days ago, U.S. President Truman issued a statement, stating clearly that the current U.S. military has 2.9 million personnel and is still continuing to increase. This proves that the purpose of the Three Powers' suggestion to study "levels of armaments" is to allow the Three Powers to freely carry out a larger-scale arms expansion movement.

　　On March 27th, the Four-Power Assistant Foreign Ministers' meeting continued, chaired by the British representative, Davies.

　　Davies and the U.S. representative, Jessup, spoke at the meeting, opposing the inclusion of the most important and pressing issues of safeguarding peace, as suggested by the Soviet delegation, on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Their speeches once again proved that the Western Three Powers are violating the Potsdam Agreement and implementing a policy of remilitarizing West Germany.

　　Jessup, representing the Three Powers, proposed including the issue of implementing the peace treaties with Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria on the agenda, and wantonly slandered these People's Democratic countries.

　　In his speech, the Soviet representative, Gromyko, exposed the slanderous nature of the speeches by the U.S. and British representatives, who insisted that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries were increasing their armaments, attempting to use this as an excuse for the Western countries' policy of remilitarizing West Germany, expanding their armaments movement, and preparing for a new war.

　　The next meeting is scheduled for the 28th.

　　四国外长助理会议继续开会
    葛罗米柯斥责美国代表歪曲苏联建议
    坚主讨论履行波茨坦协定及四国裁军等主要议案
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：四国外长助理会议于三月二十一日继续开会，由苏联代表葛罗米柯任主席。
    在上次会议上，苏联代表团曾就关于裁减四国军队的一项议案提出新的措辞。这次会议上，西方三国代表对于苏联的这个建议并没有表示明确的态度。法国代表巴罗第一再想以关于“军备水平”的含糊措辞来代替关于裁减四国军队问题的明白而具体的议案。英国代表戴维斯表示苏联的新建议“不能作为协议的基础”。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在发言中斥责美国代表耶塞普故意歪曲苏联建议的含义，指出西方三国代表之所以一再表示把肃清德国军国主义和裁减四国军队问题列入议程实质上就会预先确定关于这些问题的决定，是想要借此来欺骗舆论，使人们不明白苏联建议的真正意义。
    葛罗米柯发言完毕后，会议即行休会。
    三月二十三日，四国外长助理举行秘密会议。但会议丝毫也没有改变准备议程的局面，因为三国代表还是无意与苏联的建议取得折衷。他们在会上重弹老调，坚持只能列入三国的建议，而不愿列入苏联代表团所提出的紧迫而急要的问题——履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定与裁减四国军队问题。
    三月二十四日，四国外长助理会议继续开会，由法国代表巴罗第任主席。
    会上西方三国代表竭力想规避讨论议程中的主要议案——裁减四国军队和履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定。美国代表耶塞普和英国代表戴维斯再次提出对奥和约的问题，并反对把履行对意和约中关于的里雅斯特条款的问题列入议程。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在发言中指出：许多事实证明，拖延对奥和约准备工作的是美英法三国政府。苏联代表建议真正实施莫斯科宣言中关于奥国问题的原则并实施四国的其他协议，但是，这些建议立即受到三国代表的反对。
    葛罗米柯接着说：苏联代表团仍然坚持把履行对意和约中关于的里雅斯特的部分作为单独一项列入议程。因为西方三国把的里雅斯特非法地变成美英军事基地的结果，对意和约已被破坏。
    葛罗米柯随后驳斥三国在提出研究“军备水平”的建议时暗示苏联军队好像过于庞大的说法。葛罗米柯指出：几天以前美国总统杜鲁门发表声明，明白说出目前美国军队有两百九十万兵员，而且还在继续增加。这证明了三国代表关于研究“军备水平”的建议的目的，在于使三国放手进行更大规模的扩张军备运动。
    三月二十七日，四国外长助理会议继续举行，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。
    戴维斯和美国代表耶塞普在会上发言，反对把苏联代表团所建议的最重要而迫切的保障和平的问题列入外长会议议程。他们的发言再一次证明：西方三国正在违反波茨坦协定而执行使西德重新军国主义化的政策。
    耶塞普代表三国提议把关于履行对匈牙利、罗马尼亚与保加利亚各国的和约问题列入议程，并对这些人民民主国家大肆毁谤。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在他的发言中揭露了美英两国代表发言的诽谤性质，他们硬说苏联与人民民主国家增加军备，企图借此为西方国家所进行的使西德重新军国主义化的政策、扩张军备运动与新战争准备辩解。
    下次会议定于二十八日举行。
