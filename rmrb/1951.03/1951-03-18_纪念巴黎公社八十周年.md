　　Commemorating the 80th Anniversary of the Paris Commune
     Zhang Zifan
     I
    Eighty years ago, on the morning of March 18, 1871, Paris was awakened by the thunderous cry of "Long Live the Commune!"
    On this day, the proletariat of Paris overthrew the rule of the big bourgeoisie and landlords, and for the first time in world history established a government that was essentially of the working class—the Paris Commune (La Commune de Paris).
    As a result of the Franco-Prussian War from July 19, 1870, to January 28, 1871, Napoleon III was captured, France was defeated, and the careerist Thiers seized state power. After colluding with Bismarck, he turned around and attempted to disarm the National Guard, which was mostly composed of workers, to eliminate a hidden danger.
    On March 18, 1871, the Thiers reactionary traitorous government sent troops to seize the workers' cannons. Not only did this not achieve its goal, but it turned the entire Paris upside down. Soldiers united with each other. The workers occupied the entire Paris. The Central Committee elected by the National Guard became the provisional revolutionary government, and the first red flag was raised over the city hall. The Thiers government fled to Versailles. On February 26, Paris elected the Commune, and on the 28th, a solemn ceremony for the establishment of the Commune was held amidst the cheers of the people of the city.
    The reactionaries who fled to Versailles, in order to overthrow the Commune and restore their reactionary rule, tried every possible means to gain time and gather strength. From the remaining troops who had withdrawn, plus a large number of French prisoners of war released by Bismarck, they reorganized a counter-revolutionary army and began attacking Paris on April 2. On May 12, they launched a fierce general offensive with superior forces. All members of the Commune, all the working people of Paris, regardless of gender or age, rose up to defend the Commune desperately. On May 21, due to the internal response of spies, the Versailles army broke into the city of Paris. Thus, every street, every house, every door and window, every obstacle became a fortress for the Commune fighters to defend and kill the enemy. They fought the enemy for a whole week. Countless heroes sacrificed heroically in the cry of "Long Live the Commune!" By the 28th, Paris, which had been liberated by the Commune, was finally captured by the enemy. During this bloody week, the number of deaths was estimated to be over 30,000. After that, 38,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, punished, and exiled, including more than 1,000 women and 650 children.
    The Commune created by the workers of Paris was finally defeated under the frenzied invasion of Thiers' reactionary armed forces and Prussian interventionists. Paris fell again under the bloody rule of reactionary forces.
    Although the Paris Commune failed, Marx wrote the following at the end of the First International's address to European and American members three days later: "The workers' Paris, with its Commune, will forever be celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined forever in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators history has already nailed to the pillory from which all the prayers of their priests will not avail to redeem them." ("The Civil War in France," Liberation Press Edition, p. 106)

    Although the Commune existed for only seventy-one days, during these short days of battle, the heroes of Paris launched a revolutionary historical upheaval, creating a glorious revolutionary model for later generations, and leaving us with many valuable bloody experiences and lessons.
    The Commune first smashed the old state machinery and established new organs of power. All officials were elected by universal suffrage by the people and could be replaced at any time. Their treatment was the same as ordinary workers, without privileges. Legislation and administration were united, creating the principle of democratic centralism. The Commune Committee was a working organ serving the people, and each department had a committee of five to eight people. At the same time, the Commune also announced the separation of church and state and confiscated the illegal property of the church.
    Secondly, the Commune promulgated and implemented many revolutionary economic decrees, and implemented new social policies and worker welfare facilities. Ordered the organization of industry. State-owned enterprises formulated production plans, established military supply clothing factories, prohibited night work for bakers, prohibited wage reductions under various excuses, paid living expenses to unemployed workers on a daily basis and established employment agencies, handed over factories and workshops of fleeing households and those that stopped work to worker cooperatives for operation, formulated compensation methods for military dependents, confiscated the houses of fleeing households for suffering workers to live in, dealt with beggars and prostitution, and established public canteens, etc.
    Thirdly, the Commune also made great creative work in education. It announced the principles of compulsory primary education and non-religious compulsory education. All schools were separated from the influence of the church, and children could attend school for free. The status of teachers was improved, salaries were also increased, and male and female teachers were treated equally. At the same time, a plan to establish kindergartens was also formulated. Artists were also organized to form an artists association, etc.
    In addition, the Commune also had an important characteristic, which fully demonstrated the internationalist spirit of the proletariat. They demolished the triumphal column in the Place Vendôme, which Napoleon I had cast in 1809 with the cannons of the enemy, symbolizing national aggression and national hatred. It also united representatives from Poland, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Belgium, Russia and other countries. For example, the Austrian worker Frankel was appointed as a member of the Commune and Minister of Labor, the famous Polish revolutionary hero Dombrowski served as an important leader guarding Paris, and the Russian female revolutionary Dmitrova was one of the leaders of the Commune women, and so on. Workers of the world are one family, because the banner of the Commune is the banner of the world republic. As Comrade Dimitrov said: "The decrees of the Commune, all its activities, its composition, its existence, its slogans, the ardent cries of its fighters, their last wills - all this is filled with the spirit of internationalism." ("Selected Works of Dimitrov," Liberation Press Edition, p. 438)
  III
    The main reasons for the failure of the Commune were the lack of truly unified proletarian leadership and the commission of some serious political errors in the revolutionary struggle. The most fundamental reason was the lack of a truly unified working-class party, the leadership of the vanguard of the proletariat—the Communist Party.
    At that time, the leaders of the Paris Revolution were Blanquists and Proudhonists, neither of which were communists. The former was mainly responsible for politics, and the latter was mainly responsible for economics. And the influence of true Marxism in France at that time was still relatively small. The two factions disagreed on such an important issue as political power. In this way, the proletariat of Paris could not be fully prepared and trained, and even did not have a correct understanding of the huge tasks before them and the methods of completing them. Thus, it could not become the organizer and leader of revolutionary action, and could not win over the vast peasant reserves to fight together.
    Comrade Stalin wrote: "In short, the exclusive leadership of a party, namely the Communist Party, is the basic point in the preparation of the October Revolution... This is where the October Revolution differs from and is superior to the French Revolution of 1871, because in the French Revolution of 1871, the leadership of the revolution was shared by two parties, and neither of them could be called a Communist Party." ("Problems of Leninism," Moscow Chinese Edition, pp. 141-142)
    Although many actions taken by the Commune were "often completely correct" due to the strength of the masses and the requirements of the situation, the Commune did not have a clear program of action, a correct line, or a strong alliance between workers and peasants. Because it did not have the leadership of such a strong party, the Commune finally failed.
    The experience of the Paris Commune vividly illustrates this revolutionary truth: the leadership of a revolutionary unified proletarian party armed with Marxism-Leninism and connected with the broad masses is the primary condition for the victory of the revolution and the true and thorough liberation of the proletariat and the working masses.
    In addition, the Paris Commune also made the following important political errors.
    When the enemy fled, the Commune not only did not close the city gates, but allowed them to be wide open, allowing the soldiers of the reactionary government's army to be driven out of the city in groups by the gendarmerie, and these soldiers could have joined the revolution with a little effort at that time. More importantly, when the enemy fled to Versailles, as Marx pointed out: "They should have marched on Versailles at once. They lost the critical moment because of conscience scruples. They did not want to start a civil war, as if that malicious goblin Thiers had not already started the civil war by attempting to disarm Paris." ("The Civil War in France," Liberation Press Edition, p. 108) In this way, the enemy gained a respite, and after a large number of French prisoners of war were released to strengthen their forces, they put down the mask of peace and attacked Paris.
    "The second mistake," Marx wrote, "The Central Committee surrendered its power too soon, in order to make way for the Commune. This was again due to being 'too upright' to the point of being suspicious!" (Ibid.) Originally, the Central Committee elected by the entire army was suitable to take control of the Paris government under the circumstances at that time, but in order to avoid the suspicion of usurping power, ignoring the true needs of the revolutionary interests, and ignoring the important fact that the Thiers fleeing government still existed outside the city of Paris, it hastily handed over power to the elected Commune, whose components were not as good as the Central Committee. Moreover, this election also had shortcomings and was not carried out in accordance with the principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The Commune did not carry out timely and necessary suppression of reactionary elements such as enemies, traitors, spies, and secret agents who remained in the city of Paris, and these class enemies were able to remain safely in Paris to conspire to sabotage and spread rumors. For example, on March 22, the "rich young masters" of Paris, under the instigation of relatives of the royal family such as Haikeren, held a secret armed so-called "peaceful" demonstration to the Commune, insulting and disarming National Guard inspectors and sentries wherever they went. When they arrived at the Place Vendôme, they shouted reactionary slogans such as "Down with the Central Committee!" "Down with the Paris Commune!" and attempted to attack the headquarters of the National Guard. On May 17, secret agents created the explosion at the Rapp Street ammunition factory, etc. At the same time, the Commune was too late to seal off reactionary newspapers, and even if they were closed, they did not investigate their printing locations and arrest their staff, so that they could continue to be published after changing their names.
    The Commune did not confiscate the lifeline of the French ruling class - the Bank of France. Engels wrote about this matter: "What we cannot understand in particular is the Commune's lenient attitude towards the Bank of France, which was also a very serious political mistake." (Ibid., p. 13) At that time, the Commune not only did not confiscate it, but borrowed 16 million francs from the bank in a situation of extreme financial difficulty, but the bank supplied Versailles with 257 million francs in cash within two months, more than fifteen times the amount used by the Commune. At that time, the bank had 3 billion francs, of which 1.3 billion was in gold and cash, and the rest was in securities. Even more so, the Commune only sent a political commissar, which was actually equivalent to protecting the bank's treasury for Versailles, and the bank's old guards were still maintained.
    The Commune also had a major oversight in military affairs, which was that it overly believed in Prussia's neutrality and did not defend the northern part of the city well. Marx had warned them about this in advance, but unfortunately the Commune did not accept this advice, and finally allowed the enemy to take advantage of this weakness and attack Paris.
    There was internal discord within the Commune. The struggle between the Blanquists and the Proudhonists began shortly after the Commune elections. On April 30, serious differences of opinion arose between the two factions over the issue of setting up a social security committee that should hold broad powers. It even led to twenty-two Commune members publishing a statement resigning from the Commune. Although they later returned to the Commune, this greatly weakened the Commune's strength.
    In addition, the Commune also made a mistake in not listening to Marx's advice to make good use of the important documents left behind by the Thiers government when it fled in a hurry to expose the enemy's conspiracies and crimes.
    The Paris Commune finally failed due to the above reasons and various internal and external conditions at that time. But the historical significance of the Commune is very great. Marx said: "The struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie and its state has entered a new phase because of the struggle in Paris. Regardless of its immediate outcome, a new starting point of world-historic importance has been gained." (Ibid., pp. 111-112)
    Lenin and Stalin had extremely high evaluations of the historical significance of the Commune. Lenin believed that the Commune was "the first step of world-historic significance" in the development of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and "the Soviet is the second step" (see "Modern History Course" compiled by the History Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Xinhua Bookstore Edition, Volume 3, p. 62). Comrade Stalin also said: "The Paris Commune is the germ of this form. Soviet power is the development and completion of this form." ("Problems of Leninism," Moscow Chinese Edition, p. 64)
  IV
    The entire history of the Paris Commune can prove that Marx was the true leader of the greatest proletarian revolution in the world. Six months before the Paris uprising, when the situation was not yet suitable for the uprising, Marx warned the French workers in this way: "When the enemy (referring to the Prussians - Zhang Note) is knocking on the gates of Paris, any attempt to overthrow the new government (referring to the Thiers government - Zhang Note) is an unwise and desperate act of foolishness." But when the workers had already risen up, the great Marx not only did not, like the sermons of some mediocrities, give them a bureaucratic reprimand, but moved forward with them and learned together in the struggle. Living in exile in London, Marx was always keenly concerned about this historical event. From his letters to Commune members Frankel and Warron, "Regarding your cause, I have written hundreds of letters to all parts of the world where we have branches (referring to the First International branches)," it can be seen how much Marx cared about the Paris Revolution. At the same time, Marx never ignored any mistakes of the Commune, and of course he cherished the positive historical significance of this great event even more. From the entire history of the Commune, it can be known that Marx was truly the greatest and most profound thinker and revolutionary mentor.
  V
    The world history has undergone rare and great changes in these eighty years. The rapid development and growth of the Communist Party in various countries, the surging worker revolutionary movements in various countries, the victory of the Russian October Socialist Revolution, the rise of many people's democratic countries in the Eurasian continent, the birth of the great People's Republic of China, and the unprecedented growth of the world-scale peace forces, all fully demonstrate that today's old world headed by American imperialism for war and aggression is even more weakened and isolated, and will inevitably move towards death in the end, while the new world of peace and democracy headed by the socialist Soviet Union is even stronger, and will inevitably win permanent victory in the end.
    Today, the French working class, under the leadership of the French Communist Party, inheriting the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, has always been at the forefront of the struggle, making heroic and unremitting struggles for the liberation of the French people.
    As we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Paris Commune, we must remember the bloody lessons left to us by the Commune revolution. Let us arm ourselves with the great Marxist thought, under the leadership of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, closely unite with international friends, and bravely fight to smash the enslavement rule of American imperialism in various parts of the world and its frenzied aggression in Korea, to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, and for a better new society!
    The martyrs of Paris, the first proletarian revolutionary heroes in history, created extremely valuable experiences and lessons and immortal examples for the revolutionary cause of all mankind. Their great role is by no means limited to Paris and France, but to the whole world. The influence of the Paris Commune is by no means temporary, but runs through the entire new history.

　　纪念巴黎公社八十周年
    张子凡
     一
    距今八十年前，一八七一年三月十八日晨，巴黎被如雷的“公社万岁！”的喊声惊醒了。
    巴黎的无产阶级在这一天，推翻了大资产阶级大地主的统治，在世界历史上第一次建立了本质上是工人阶级的政府——巴黎公社（La Eommune de Paris）。
    一八七○年七月十九日到一八七一年一月二十八日普法战争的结果，拿破仑第三被俘，法国战败，钻营禄位的野心家梯尔窃取了国家大权，与俾斯麦媾和后，回转头来想解除以工人占多数的国民军的武装，铲除他的心腹之患。
    一八七一年三月十八日，梯尔反动卖国政府派军队来夺取工人的大炮，结果不但没有达到目的，反使整个巴黎翻了身。兵士彼此联合了起来。工人占领了整个巴黎。由国民军选出的中央委员会成了革命的临时政府，市政厅上升起了第一面红旗。梯尔政府逃往凡尔赛。二月二十六日巴黎选举了公社，二十八日在全市人民的欢呼声中举行了庄严的公社成立典礼。
    逃到凡尔赛的反动派，为了推翻公社，恢复其反动统治，便千方百计争取时间，收集力量，由撤出的一部分残余军队，加上俾斯麦释放回来的大批法军俘虏，重新组成反革命的军队，在四月二日就开始了对巴黎进攻，五月十二日又以优势的兵力发动了猛烈的总攻。公社的全体社员，巴黎的全体劳动人民，不分男女老少都起来拚命保卫公社。五月二十一日由于奸细的内应，凡尔赛的军队闯进了巴黎城。于是每一条街道，每一座房屋，每一扇门窗，每一个障碍物都成了公社战士们防守和杀敌的堡垒。就这样与敌人搏斗了整整一星期，无数的英雄在“公社万岁！”声中壮烈牺牲了，到二十八日为公社所解放的巴黎终于被敌人攻陷了。在这流血的一星期内，死亡的人数据估计总在三万人以上。而以后被捕入狱受刑和流放的又有三万八千人，其中有一千多妇女和六百五十个儿童。
    巴黎工人所创造的公社终于在梯尔反动武装和普鲁士干涉者疯狂进犯之下失败了，巴黎又跌到反动势力的血腥统治之下了。
    巴黎公社虽然失败了，但是马克思于三天之后在第一国际告欧美会员书的结束时这样写道：“工人的巴黎与他们的公社将永远是被敬为新社会光荣的先驱者。它的被难者，将永远被记在工人阶级伟大的心坎之中。它的刽子手，已被历史钉上了耻辱牌，任何他们牧师的祷告都不能把他们取下来。”（《法兰西内战》，解放社版、第一○六页）
  二
    公社虽然只存在了七十一天，可是在这短短的战斗的日子里，巴黎的英雄展开了翻天覆地的历史大革命，给后世创造了光辉的革命范例，给我们留下来许多宝贵的血的经验教训。
    公社首先粉碎了旧的国家机器并建立了新的政权机关。一切官吏由人民普选，并可以随时撤换。他们的待遇和普通工人一样，没有特权。立法与行政合而为一，创立了民主集中制的原则。公社委员会就是为人民服务的工作机关，每一部门都设有由五人到八人组成的委员会。同时公社还宣布了政教分离，并没收教会的非法财产。
    其次，公社颁布并实行了许多革命的经济法令，实行了新的社会政策和工人福利的设施。命令把工业组织起来。国营企业制定了生产计划，建立了军需被服厂，禁止面包工人夜工，禁止各种借口减低工资，按日发给失业工人生活费并设立职业介绍所，把逃亡户的和停工的工厂与作坊交工人合作社经营，制定阵亡军属的抚恤办法，没收逃亡户的住宅给受难工人居住，处置乞丐和卖淫，设立公共食堂等。
    再次，公社在教育方面也做了巨大的创造工作。宣布了强迫性的初等教育和非宗教的义务教育原则，一切学校脱离教会的影响，儿童可以免费上学。教员的地位提高了，薪金也增加了，男女教员待遇平等。同时还制定了成立幼稚园的计划。把艺术家们也组织起来，成立了艺术家协会等。
    此外公社还有一个重要的特点，就是充分表现了无产阶级的国际主义精神。他们拆毁了拿破仑第一在一八○九年，用敌人的炮所铸成的象征民族侵略主义和民族仇恨的凡尔登广场上的凯旋柱。还团结了波兰人、奥地利人、意大利人、匈牙利人、比利时人、俄罗斯人和其他国家的代表。如委任奥地利工人福兰克尔为公社委员兼劳动部长，著名的波兰革命英雄敦布罗夫斯基充任守卫巴黎的重要领袖，俄国女革命家季米特洛娃是公社妇女领袖之一等等。全世界工人是一家，因为公社的旗帜就是世界共和国的旗帜。正如季米特洛夫同志所说：“公社的法令，一切它的活动，它的成份，它的存在，它的口号，它的战士的热烈呼声，他们的最后遗嘱——这一切都充满着国际主义的精神。”（《季米特洛夫文集》、解放社版、第四三八页）
  三
    公社失败的主要原因是缺乏真正无产阶级的统一领导，以及在革命斗争中又犯了一些严重的政治错误。最基本的原因就是因为缺少真正工人阶级统一的政党，无产阶级的先锋队——共产党的领导。
    当时领导巴黎革命的是勃朗基主义者和普鲁东主义者，两者都不是共产党。前者主要负责政治，后者主要负责经济。而真正的马克思主义者在当时的法国影响还比较小。这两派之间在政权的这样重要的问题上，主张又很不一致。这样巴黎的无产阶级就不能得到充分的准备和训练，甚至对摆在面前的巨大任务和完成的方法也没有正确的认识。这样就不能成为革命行动的组织者与领袖，不能争取广大的农民后备军来一起战斗。
    斯大林同志写道：“总之，一个党，即共产党独占领导，是十月革命准备工作的基本要点，……这就是十月革命与法国一八七一年革命不同而优胜于它的地方，因为在法国一八七一年革命中，革命的领导是由两个党所分担，而且无论其中那一个党都不能称为共产党。”（《列宁主义问题》莫斯科中文版、第一四一——一四二页）
    由于群众的力量和局势所要求，虽然公社采取的许多行动“常常是完全正确的”。但是公社没有明确的行动纲领，没有正确的路线，没有造成工农的坚强联合，就因为没有这样一个强大政党的领导，所以公社终于失败了。
    巴黎公社的经验鲜明地说明了这一条革命的真理：为马克思列宁主义所武装的、联系广大群众的、革命的统一的无产阶级政党的领导，是革命胜利与无产阶级和劳动群众获得真正彻底解放的首要条件。
    此外巴黎公社还犯了下面这些重要的政治错误。
    在敌人逃跑时公社不但没有把城门关起来，反让城门大开着，允许反动政府的军队兵士成群被宪兵队逐出城去，而这些兵士当时只要稍加努力争取就可以参加革命的。更重要的是当敌人逃往凡尔赛后，正如马克思所指出的：“他们应该立即向凡尔赛进军。由于良心上的踌躇，他们丧失了时机。他们不愿发动国内战争，好象那恶毒的妖物梯亥尔还没有因企图解除巴黎武装而把内战发动起来似的。”（《法兰西内战》、解放社版、第一○八页）这样敌人就获得了喘息的时间，在大批法国俘虏放回来加强他们的力量后，便放下了和平的假面具，来攻打巴黎了。
    “第二个错误——马克思写道——中央委员会为要让位给公社，而把权力放弃得太早。这又是由于“太过端正”以至流于疑惧！”（同上）本来由全军选出的中央委员会在当时情况下是适合掌握巴黎政权的，但他们为了避免僭夺政权的嫌疑，不顾革命利益的真正需要，忽视了梯尔逃亡政府还存在于巴黎城外这样一个决不容忽视的重要事实，却匆忙把权力交给选出的成份还不如中央委员会的公社。而且这一选举也存在着缺点，没有依照无产阶级专政的原则进行。
    公社没有对留在巴黎城内的敌人、叛徒、间谍、特务等类反动分子实行及时和必要的镇压，竟使这些阶级敌人还能安然无事留在巴黎阴谋破坏和造谣诬蔑。例如三月二十二日，巴黎的“阔人少爷们”在海开伦一类皇亲国戚的指使下向公社举行了秘密武装的所谓“和平的”示威游行，所到之处侮辱并解除国民军巡查员和哨兵的武装。到凡尔登广场时竟狂喊出“打倒中央委员会！”“打倒巴黎公社！”等反动口号，并企图袭击国民军总司令部。五月十七日特务又制造了拉浦街弹药厂的爆炸事件等。同时公社对反动报纸查封得也太迟，即使封闭了也没追查其印刷场所和逮捕其工作人员，以致它们仍能在更名改姓之后继续出版。
    公社没有没收法国统治阶级的命根——法兰西银行。恩格斯提到此事时这样写道：“尤其使我们不能了解的，是公社对于法兰西银行的宽大态度，这也是非常重大的政治的错误。”（同上书、第十三页）公社当时不但没有把它没收，在财政极困难的情形下，反向该行借款一千六百万佛郎，可是该行却在两个月内接济了凡尔赛现款达二万万五千七百万佛郎之巨，比公社动用的多十五倍以上，当时该行存有三十万万佛郎，其中十三万万是黄金和现款，其余是有价证券。尤其甚者，公社只派去了一个政治委员，而实际上等于替凡尔赛保护钱库，该行旧有的卫兵也仍然保有着。
    公社在军事上还有一个重大的疏忽，就是过于相信普鲁士的中立，在城的北部没有很好设防，这一点马克思本来在事先就警告过他们，可惜公社没有接受这一劝告，终于让敌人利用了这一弱点，攻入巴黎。
    公社内部不和，勃朗基主义者和普鲁东主义者之间的斗争在公社选举后不久就开始了。四月三十日为了设置应握有广泛权力的社会治安委员会的问题，两派之间发生了严重的意见分歧。甚至闹到有二十二个公社委员登报声明退出公社的地步，虽然他们以后又回到公社里来，但这却大大地削弱了公社的力量。
    此外公社还有一个失策，就是没有听从马克思的劝告，将梯尔政府匆忙逃跑时丢下的重要文件善于利用，来揭露敌人的阴谋罪行。
    巴黎公社由于上述种种原因以及当时各种内部和外部的条件，终于失败了。但公社的历史意义是非常重大的。马克思说：“工人阶级反对资产阶级及其国家的斗争，因巴黎的斗争而进入一个新的阶段。不管其直接的结果如何，一个有世界历史重要性的新出发点是已经取得了。”（同上书、第一一一——一一二页）
    列宁和斯大林对公社的历史意义估价极高。列宁认为公社是无产阶级专政发展上“有世界历史意义的第一步”，“苏维埃是第二步”（见苏联科学院历史院编：“近代史教程”、新华书店版、第三分册、第六二页）。而斯大林同志也说：“巴黎公社是这种形式的萌芽。苏维埃政权是这种形式的发展和完成。”（《列宁主义问题》、莫斯科中文版，第六四页）
  四
    巴黎公社的全部历史可以证明马克思是全世界最伟大的无产阶级革命的真正领导者。马克思在巴黎起义前六个月，当时情况还不适于起义时，就这样警告法国工人说：“正在敌人（指普鲁士人——张注）敲着巴黎城门的时候，一切推翻新政府（指梯尔政府——张注）的企图，是不智的绝望的蠢举。”可是当工人们已经起义之后，伟大的马克思不但没有像一些庸人的说教一样，去向他们作一番官僚的训斥，而是同他们一起前进，一起在斗争中学习。在伦敦过着流亡生活的马克思时刻热切地关怀着这一历史的大事变。由他给公社社员福兰克福和瓦尔伦信中“关于你们的事业，我曾向凡设有我们支部（按指第一国际支部）的世界一切地方，写过几百封信”这几句话就可以看出马克思是多么关心巴黎的革命。同时马克思也决不忽视公社任何一个错误，当然他更珍视这一伟大事变积极的历史意义。从公社的全部历史中可以知道马克思是真正最伟大最渊博的思想家和革命的导师。
  五
    世界历史在这八十年里起了罕有的大变化，共产党在各国的迅速发展与壮大，各国工人革命运动风起云涌，俄国十月社会主义革命的胜利，欧亚大陆许多人民民主国家的兴起，伟大的中华人民共和国的诞生，世界规模的和平力量的空前增长，这些充分可以说明，今天以美国帝国主义为首的战争和侵略的旧世界是更加削弱和孤立了，最后必定要走向死亡，而以社会主义苏联为首的和平民主新世界是更加强大了，最后必定要取得永远的胜利。
    今天法国工人阶级在法国共产党的领导下，承继着巴黎公社的革命传统，始终走在斗争的前列，为法国人民的解放作英勇不懈的斗争。
    我们纪念巴黎公社八十周年，要好好记取公社革命所留给我们的血的教训。让我们以伟大的马克思主义的思想武装自己，在我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，紧密地与国际友人团结在一起，为打碎美帝国主义在世界各地的奴役统治和在朝鲜的疯狂侵略，为巩固我国的人民民主专政，为更美好的新社会而勇敢战斗！
    巴黎的烈士们，历史上第一批无产阶级革命的英雄们，为了全人类的革命事业创造了极为宝贵的经验教训和不朽的范例。他们的伟大作用决不只限于巴黎和法兰西，而是全世界。巴黎公社的影响决不是一时的，而是贯串着全部新历史的。
