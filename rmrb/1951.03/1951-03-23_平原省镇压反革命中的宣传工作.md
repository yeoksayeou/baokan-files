　　Propaganda Work in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries in Pingyuan Province
　　Gong Cai
　　Since October of last year, public security organs at all levels in Pingyuan Province have adopted various methods to carry out propaganda work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in urban and rural areas relatively universally, and have achieved many successes. The experiences are introduced as follows:
　　1. Holding Public Security Exhibitions. The Provincial Public Security Department and the Public Security Bureaus of Xinxiang and Anyang, as well as the Public Security Offices of six special districts including Liaocheng, and more than half of the counties in the province, held small-scale mobile public security exhibitions during the National Day, New Year's Day, especially at rural mule and horse fairs and market days, which were very popular among the masses. In Anyang City alone, the exhibition attracted 216,000 visitors in twenty days. After seeing the exhibits, the masses generally reflected: "Special agents are harming us, they must be suppressed!" Qin Wangshi, a female labor model from Xibojian Village, District 3, Anyang, actively promoted the exhibition to villagers after returning to the village, exposing the counter-revolutionary acts of unscrupulous landlords reversing settlements and the fraudulent inside stories of secret societies, and debunking their counter-revolutionary rumors, launching a mass anti-special agent propaganda campaign.
　　2. Convening Accusation Meetings. When Ye County executed Li Anguo and other eight counter-revolutionaries who had committed heinous crimes and were hated by everyone, a mass accusation meeting was held. The government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities was explained at the meeting. After the meeting, mass reporting and accusations increased greatly. Twenty-five primary school teachers voluntarily confessed to having had contact with the bandit Li and repented to the government. After the public trial of unscrupulous landlords in Yuanyang, the morale of the masses was high, and the cadres also felt that the work was easier to do. Landlords who had not reversed settlements believed: "It is fortunate that I have not reversed settlements, and I must be honest in the future." After Shan County announced the death penalty for the local tyrants Zhu Shengzhe and He Shengqin at the People's Representative Conference, more than 20 landlords returned the fruits of reversed settlements. Various counties mostly adopted the method of mass accusations when dealing with the counter-offensive and settlement reversal of unscrupulous landlords, which played a great role. Therefore, the counter-offensive and settlement reversal activities of landlords were basically stopped throughout the province.
　　3. Strengthening propaganda on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in newspapers and periodicals. Each time a major counter-revolutionary case is handled, the Provincial Public Security Department liaises with the newspaper and propaganda departments to issue announcements and compile various propaganda materials; at the same time, editorials are published in the Pingyuan Daily, and news reports are co-written with newspaper reporters. Since July of last year, 81 news items on the execution of bandits and special agents, the banning of reactionary secret societies, unscrupulous landlords, and the reversal of settlements, etc., have been published on the front page, along with five editorials and short commentaries. In addition, many mass reading materials have been compiled. The Provincial Public Security Department has compiled teaching materials for the masses to oppose spies, and the Anyang Special District Public Security Office has written propaganda brochures on eliminating bandits and special agents and banning secret societies.
　　4. Organizing awakened members of secret societies to use their own experiences to speak to the public. The Anyang Special District Public Security Office used former members who had withdrawn from the societies to play the roles of "Taoist priests" and "fairy maidens" to expose the fraudulent inside stories of the societies. They went to the countryside village by village to give personal accounts, and the masses surrounded them in groups after chasing them through six or seven villages, saying: "So that's what secret societies are like, we can't be fooled by them." In December of last year, the Anyang Special District Public Security Office mobilized 7,000 members to withdraw from the societies through 230 trained members who went back to publicize.
　　From the above work, we have gained the following insights:
　　1. Handling counter-revolutionary cases with greater educational significance and wider impact on the masses must be combined with extensive, in-depth, and lively propaganda and education work. Carry out propaganda freely, and educate the masses to raise their vigilance. Facts have proved that only by carrying out propaganda work correctly and appropriately can we mobilize the broad masses to guard against spies and special agents. Such propaganda work will not only not hinder investigation and case detection, but will also greatly benefit the investigation and case detection work of specialized agencies.
　　2. Holding exhibitions should be combined with festivals and with mass gatherings in rural markets and mule and horse fairs. Holding small-scale mobile exhibitions is easy to implement, and the written explanations are best compiled in popular and lively folk forms such as clapper talk and doggerel. The writing should be clear and in regular script so that the general public can understand it. In large-scale exhibitions, the collection of special case materials should be comprehensive, with a beginning and an end, and the main links of the case should be clearly highlighted. Evidence and physical objects such as documents, stamps, and official seals are most concerned and focused on by the masses and have the greatest educational effect on the masses. This inspires us to consciously take photos of the key links of the case when investigating and solving typical cases, collect all the evidence, and compile and organize it at any time to prepare for propaganda so that we can carry out propaganda in a timely and rapid manner.
　　3. Mobilize various propaganda forces in urban and rural areas. In cities, public security organs should take the initiative to cooperate with newspapers, news agencies, reporters, and cultural and educational and art departments, regard publicizing the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities in newspapers as regular work, and compile more teaching materials, create artistic works, and mass reading materials; in rural areas, propaganda forces such as primary school teachers, village theater troupes, and folk artists should be organized to deepen the propaganda on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries among the peasant masses.

　　平原省镇压反革命中的宣传工作
    公材
    去年十月份以来，平原省各级公安机关采取各种方式，在城市和乡村较为普遍地开展了镇压反革命的宣传工作，并取得了不少成绩，兹介绍其经验如下：
    一、举办公安展览。省公安厅及新乡、安阳两市公安局与聊城等六个专员公署公安处，以及全省半数以上的县份都分别于国庆节、元旦，特别是在农村的骡马庙会和集市上举行了小型的巡回公安展览，极受群众欢迎。仅安阳市在展览二十天中观众即达二十一万六千人。群众看过展览品后普遍反映：“特务祸害我们，非镇压不可！”安阳三区西柏涧村女劳动模范秦王氏等参观展览回村后，自动积极地向村民宣传，揭破不法地主的倒算等反革命行为及会道门的骗人内幕，并揭穿其反革命谣言，展开了群众性的反对特务宣传工作。
    二、召开控诉大会。邺县处决罪大恶极、人人痛恨的李安国等八名反革命分子时，举行了群众控诉大会，会上讲明了政府镇压反革命活动的政策，会后群众密告检举者大为增加，有二十五名小学教员自动声明曾和李匪发生过联系，向政府坦白悔过。原阳公审不法地主大会开过后，群众情绪很高，干部也觉得工作好做了，未倒算的地主认为：“没有倒算是侥幸，今后可得老实。”单县在人民代表会上宣布了恶霸地主朱圣哲、何圣钦死刑后，有二十多个地主退回了倒算果实。各县在处理不法地主的反攻倒算时，多采取了群众控诉的方式，起了很大的作用。因此在全省范围内基本上停止了地主反攻倒算活动。
    三、在报纸刊物上加强对镇压反革命的宣传。每次处理重大的反革命案件，都由省公安厅与报社、宣教部门联系，颁发布告，编写各种宣传品；同时在平原日报上发表社论，与报社记者合作写消息通讯。自去年七月份以来，以头版登载的处决土匪、特务案件，取缔反动会门、不法地主及反倒算等新闻八十一件，社论、短论五篇。此外并编写了许多群众读物，省公安厅编写了群众反对奸细的教材，安阳专区公安处写了肃清土匪特务、取缔会道门的宣传手册。
    四、组织觉悟了的会门道徒，活人活事、现身说法。安阳专区公安处以退道的道徒扮演“道长”“仙姑”拆穿其骗人内幕，到农村逐村现身说法，群众撵过六七个村庄团团围看，说：“原来会道门是这样，可不能上它的当”。安阳专区公安处于去年十二月份通过集训过的二百三十名道徒回去宣传，发动了七千名道徒退道。
    从以上工作中，我们得到几点体会：
    一、处理对群众教育意义较大、影响面较宽的反革命案件，必须与广泛深入、活泼多样的宣传教育工作结合进行。放手宣传，并从中教育群众提高警觉。事实证明：只有正确地适当地进行宣传工作，才能够发动广大群众防备奸细特务，这样的宣传工作不仅不会妨碍侦察破案，而且大大有利于专门机关的侦察破案工作。
    二、举行展览会，要以结合节日，结合农村集市、骡马会等群众聚会的场所与时间为宜。举办小型巡回展览，易行易办，文字说明最好以快板、顺口溜等通俗生动的民间形式编写，写字要清笔正楷，使一般群众能听懂看懂。大型展览中，专案材料的搜集要全面，有头有尾，案情的主要环节要明确突出。文印、戳记、官防等证据、实物，最为群众关心注目，对群众教育作用最大。这启示了我们在侦察破获典型案件时，必须有意识地将案情紧要环节抓紧拍照，搜集全部证据，并随时编写整理，为宣传做好准备，以便及时地迅速地展开宣传。
    三、动员城市、农村的各种宣传力量。在城市，公安机关要主动与报纸、通讯社、记者及文教、艺术部门合作，把在报纸上宣传镇压反革命活动当做经常工作，并多多编写教材，创作艺术作品和群众读物；在乡村则应组织小学教员、村剧团、民间艺人等宣传力量，使镇压反革命宣传深入到农民群众中去。
