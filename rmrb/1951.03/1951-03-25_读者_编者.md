　　Readers and Editors
    Strengthening the Scientific Accuracy of Popular Science Illustrations
    After this journal published Mr. Wang Kuike's opinions on one book in the "Popular Science Illustrations" published by the East China Bookstore, namely "From Ape to Man" (drawn and written by Zuo Ben and Yun Quan), Mr. Xue Mingda, the editor-in-chief of "Illustrations," wrote to express that this "is the first formal criticism we have read." He also said, "We have referred to Comrade Wang's opinions and carefully reviewed the content of 'From Ape to Man,' and decided to re-edit it and redraw all the pictures." The letter also mentioned that more than a dozen types of "Illustrations" have been published, and more than twenty types are being compiled and drawn. The sales volume reflects that this type of book "is urgently needed by the public," but "because the editors and illustrators are doing the work on a trial basis," "we hope readers will offer more criticism," which "will be more helpful for our progress."

    The publication of this series of books should be welcomed. We suggest that this series of books should be closely linked with experts when compiling and drawing, and attention should be paid to popularization, but also to strengthening its scientific and systematic nature.
            Attaching Importance to Manuscript Editing
    This journal published Mr. Ding Chuanxin's opinions on the book "Taxation and Industry and Commerce" in the first issue. We have now received a letter from the publisher of the book, the Central South People's Publishing House, expressing their acceptance and reviewing the reasons for the errors in the book, which were due to insufficient clarity in the original manuscript and a lack of understanding of the importance of collation of political and legal documents. The publishing house has now stipulated that a dedicated person is responsible for manuscript editing.

    Many errors occur due to poor manuscript editing, which is a common phenomenon in the publishing industry. We hope that all publishing institutions will pay attention to improving this shortcoming.
            Editing Legal Documents Requires Attention to Time Recording
    Mr. Xie Huaishi wrote to put forward the following opinion: All publications concerning legal documents, including translated foreign legal documents, must indicate the date on which the legal document was passed or promulgated. If the document has been amended, the date of the last amendment must also be indicated. This is very important for legal documents. For example, the "Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic" and the "Constitution of the Albanian People's Republic," edited by the Legal System Committee and published by Xinhua Bookstore, do not indicate the year and month in which the constitution was passed and promulgated (formulated). The same is true of the "Constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic" published by the Era Publishing House. (The Mongolian People's Republic has formulated two constitutions and has made many amendments, but none of these are stated in this book). We agree with Mr. Xie Huaishi's opinion and take this opportunity to call the attention of public and private publishers.
            "New Children" Printed Wrong National Flags
    Mr. Li Benzhao wrote and said: "The cover of the 42nd issue of 'New Children' (published on January 1st) published by Tianjin Knowledge Bookstore printed 'Twelve National Flags of Peaceful and Democratic Countries,' and the national flags of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia were all printed in reverse. Among them, a pattern was omitted in the yellow part in the middle of the Romanian flag. In addition, the Albanian flag with a purple background, black eagle, and red star was printed as a dark red background with a yellow star; the pattern on the white part of the Bulgarian flag was omitted; and the pattern on the Hungarian flag was also printed incorrectly. I think this mistake in 'New Children' is equally worthy of serious attention by those who print national flags. This kind of error should be eliminated."

    加强科学图说的科学性
    本刊第六号发表了王奎克君对华东书店版《大众科学图说》中的一本书——《从猿到人》（编绘者左本、云泉）的意见后，《图说》的主编人薛鸣达先生来信表示：这“还是我们所读到的第一篇正式的批评”，“我们已参考了王同志的意见，把《从猿到人》的内容详细检讨一番，决定重新改编，并重绘全部的图画。”来信也说到《图说》已出版了十几种，还有二十多种正在编绘中，从销数上看可以反映这一类书“是大众急切需要的读物”，但“因为编者与绘者都在尝试地做着工作”，“希望读者多提出批评”，“那是对于我们的求进步更有帮助的”。
    这一套书的出版是应该受到欢迎的。我们建议这一套书在编绘时应该和专家们密切联系，要注意到通俗性，同时也应该加强其科学性、系统性。
            重视原稿整理工作
    本刊第一号曾经登载丁传信君对《税收与工商业》一书的意见。顷接该书出版者中南人民出版社来信，表示接受，并检讨该书发生错误的原因，是原稿整理不够清楚，以及对政令文件的校勘工作的重要性认识不足。该社现已规定有专人负责原稿整理工作。
    因原稿整理不好而发生许多错误，是出版界常有的现象，我们希望所有出版机构都要注意改进这一缺点。
            编辑法律文件须注意时间著录
    谢怀栻君来信提出下面一个意见：凡是关于法律文件的出版品，包括翻译的外国法律文件，务须注明该法律文件通过或公布的年月日。如该文件经过修改，并须注明其最后的修改年月日。——这对于法律文件是非常重要的。例如新华书店出版、法制委员会编的《匈牙利人民共和国宪法》、《阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国宪法》都没有注明该宪法是在何年何月通过公布（制定）的。时代出版社出版的《蒙古人民共和国宪法》也是一样。（蒙古人民共和国曾制定过两次宪法，又曾有多次修正，这册书内均未说明）。我们同意谢怀栻君的意见，并借此唤起公私出版家的注意。
            《新儿童》印错了各国国旗
    李本昭君来信说：“天津知识书店出版的《新儿童》四十二期（一月一日出版）封底面印了‘十二面和平民主国家的旗帜’，把我国、苏联、朝鲜、蒙古、罗马尼亚和捷克五面国旗都印反了，其中罗马尼亚的国旗中间黄色部分漏印了一个图案。此外，把紫地、黑鹰、红星的阿尔巴尼亚国旗印成了暗红地、黄星；把保加利亚国旗白色部分上的图案漏印；把匈牙利国旗上的图案也印错了。我以为《新儿童》的这一错误同样值得凡印制各国国旗者加以深刻注意。这类错误是应该消灭的。”
