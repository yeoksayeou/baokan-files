　　Currency Devaluation in Capitalist Countries and China's Exchange Rate Problem
    Xia Ming

    In the past two months or so, exchange rates have been lowered four times in succession. Some overseas Chinese, not understanding the overall situation, felt that the exchange rate was lowered too much, causing them to suffer losses, and raised some opinions. They believe that domestic prices have not fallen that much, so why has the exchange rate been lowered so much? Sometimes the black market rate for Hong Kong dollars is higher than the official rate, and they believe that it is a loss to remit money from the bank. Is the current exchange rate too low? Are overseas Chinese suffering losses? This question can be answered from the following situations.
            Since Last Year, China's Prices Have Fallen by More Than Four Percent
            US Prices Have Risen by Nearly Fifty Percent

    Since last March, the imperialist countries headed by US imperialism and their vassal states have been frantically preparing for war, leading to inflation and a sharp rise in prices, especially after US imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea. According to the Moody's Commodity Price Index, if the US price in March of last year is taken as 100, it reached 149.5 by mid-February of this year, an increase of nearly 50% (an increase of 33% in the six months after the launch of the war of aggression against Korea); according to the U.K. Commodity Price Index, British prices rose by 30.4% during the same period; the rise in prices in Hong Kong was even more intense. Taking the price of Chinese imports to Hong Kong, which has risen the most, as an example, in December of last year it rose to 193.7% of the March figure, an increase of almost one time; according to official Japanese figures, prices have risen by more than 50% from the time US imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea to February 9 of this year; the Nanyang region, where many overseas Chinese are concentrated, is also suffering from rising prices, for example, Indonesian prices in October of last year were 60% higher than in December of the previous year. Therefore, even a United Nations report entitled "World Economic Report" cannot but admit: "The economic problems faced by the whole world (referring to the capitalist world) are mainly the threat of inflation and the ever-approaching shortage of goods."

    Thus, overseas Chinese living in the US and British imperialist countries and their colonies have had much of their hard-earned income taken away invisibly by the imperialist governments through inflation in one year. This is something that many relatives of overseas Chinese in the country cannot deeply appreciate.

    The situation in China is exactly the opposite. Since the unification of financial and economic work in March of last year, prices have turned stable. The national wholesale price index, with March of last year as 100, was 95.5 in mid-February of this year, not only did it not rise, but it fell by 4.5%, and the real savings deposit rate index reflecting the cost of living fell by 10% during the same period.

    Therefore, in order to get rid of the impact of currency devaluation in imperialist countries on China, consolidate the stability of China's finance and prices, and increase the external purchasing power of our currency, it is very necessary to lower the exchange rate in a timely manner. To this end, the Bank of China lowered the exchange rate four times in April of last year (the US dollar rate fell from 42,000 yuan to 37,500 yuan). From July of last year to the present, China's prices have remained stable, while the currencies of capitalist countries have continued to depreciate sharply. Therefore, the exchange rate has been lowered eight more times (the US dollar rate has fallen from 37,500 yuan to 22,890 yuan). A total of twelve reductions have been made, the US dollar rate has fallen from 42,000 yuan to 22,890 yuan, a decrease of 45%, and the Hong Kong dollar rate has fallen from 6,460 yuan to 3,880 yuan, a decrease of 40%.

            Timely Lowering of Exchange Rate
            Eliminate the Impact of Foreign Currency Depreciation

    Timely lowering of the exchange rate has played a great role in eliminating the impact of foreign currency depreciation and consolidating the value of our currency. This can be seen very clearly from the successive reductions in the exchange rate. For example, in early September of last year, the rise in foreign prices affected domestic prices, which also rose. However, after the exchange rate was lowered by 3.7% on September 6, domestic prices not only immediately stopped rising, but also fell by 6%. The price of imported goods in Tianjin last year (based on the price of 21 imported items such as tinplate, copper wire, medicines, and rubber at the end of December 1949) rose from 68.1 in June to 152.3 in December, an increase of 123%. In Tianjin, during the same period, it rose from 154.4 to 277.9, an increase of only 80%. In January of this year, hardware in Hong Kong rose sharply, affecting Guangzhou, which also rose. However, after the exchange rate was lowered on January 20, the rise in hardware prices in Guangzhou stopped. These are all good examples.

    After US imperialism imposed a comprehensive embargo on China and froze China's funds in the United States in December of last year, the decline in the exchange rate was relatively large: it was reduced by more than one-quarter in two months. Was it lowered too much, causing overseas Chinese to suffer losses? Our research shows that the current exchange rate is not too low. On the contrary, from the current import and export situation, it is still somewhat too high. This can be seen from the following aspects:

    From the perspective of import profits: The size of import profits is one of the signs for measuring the height of the exchange rate. If there is no profit in imports, it means that the exchange rate is too high. Conversely, if the import profit is too large, it means that the exchange rate is too low. Since December of last year, the foreign prices of my imported goods have risen sharply, especially in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong import price index rose from 168.9 in early December of last year to 230 in early February of this year, an increase of 37.3%, and the highest, such as Western medicine, rose by more than five times; while domestic import prices rose by only 7.4% during the same period (Tianjin), far behind foreign prices, resulting in reduced import profits. Therefore, it is manifested in the current barter trade, reversing the past situation of imports subsidizing exports to exports subsidizing imports. For example, in Tianjin's barter trade, Category A subsidy (exports subsidize imports, the same below) is 5%, Category B is 3% to 4%, Category C is 2%, and the highest, such as Shanghai's menthol, subsidy once reached 15%.

            Encourage Exports and Take Care of Overseas Chinese
            The Current Exchange Rate is Slightly High

    From the perspective of export profits: The relationship between export profits and the exchange rate is exactly the opposite of import profits. Since the end of last year, due to the transformation of China's foreign trade, exports have decreased, and at the same time, the foreign capitalist market is experiencing a shortage of raw materials, resulting in unprecedentedly high foreign prices for my exported goods: the foreign prices of general exported goods have risen by about 20%, and the highest, such as gallnuts, have risen by 72%, peanut kernels have risen by 39%, and carpets have risen by 25%; while domestic prices have fallen due to reduced exports, and the Tianjin export price index has fallen by 14% during the same period. Some materials have fallen by 30%. Therefore, the average export profit in various places is slightly less than 13%, and Qingdao and Tianjin have reached 17%, and some materials have reached 37%. When the National Bank decides on the exchange rate, it takes into account that most of the exported materials can obtain profits. Therefore, exporters can subsidize importers in barter trade. This shows that the current exchange rate is not too low.

    From the perspective of taking care of overseas Chinese: At present, most of the overseas remittances from overseas are remitted to the country through Hong Kong. If we measure the height of the exchange rate by comparing the prices of daily necessities in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, we can see that the current exchange rate is not low but high. The following is a comparison table of the purchasing power of Hong Kong and Guangzhou currencies on February 1:

    Item      Hong Kong Price (Yuan)   Unit        Quantity that can be bought with the equivalent Hong Kong dollars after remittance to Guangzhou
    Rice          68.31        One dan      2.30 dan
    Raw Oil            1.92        One jin      1.13 jin
    Vegetables            0.25        One jin      1.62 jin
    Pork            3.25        One jin      1.94 jin
    Eggs            0.20        One      1.55
    Pine firewood            7.50        One dan      1.46 dan
    Soap            2.20        One bar      2.54 bars
    Rent          50.00        One room      1.62 rooms
    Cloth            85.00        One bolt      0.61 bolt
    White sugar            0.54        One jin      0.32 jin
    Water              0.80        One cubic meter  1.38 cubic meters
    Electricity              0.33        One unit          0.52 unit

    From the comparison of the above twelve daily necessities, it can be seen that: according to the current exchange rate, the same amount of money can buy more goods in Guangzhou than in Hong Kong, which fully shows that the current Hong Kong dollar exchange rate not only conforms to the price levels of the two places, but is also slightly higher. If calculated by the weighted average index, the current Hong Kong dollar exchange rate should be reduced to 3,094 yuan, which is 20% lower than the current exchange rate. It can be seen that the current exchange rate fully takes care of the lives of relatives of overseas Chinese. At the same time, the Bank of China's current promotion of RMB remittances (that is, converting foreign remittances into RMB remittances when they are remitted from abroad, and paying out in RMB domestically) can exempt overseas Chinese from the impact of exchange rate declines in the remittance process. The RMB remittances handled by the Bank of China in various places now account for 30% to 70% of the total remittances, and are continuing to increase, which shows that this method has been supported by overseas Chinese.

    From the above aspects of exports, imports, and overseas remittances, the current exchange rate is not too low, but fully takes care of the interests of overseas Chinese. In the midst of the increasing devaluation of imperialist currencies, in order to stabilize domestic prices and protect the interests of all the people, lowering the exchange rate is a completely necessary measure. The losses suffered by overseas Chinese were already taken away by the imperialist and colonial governments due to foreign currency devaluation before the remittances were made from abroad. Therefore, the lowering of the exchange rate is the result of foreign currency devaluation; and the National Bank has protected the actual income of overseas Chinese in the country from the moment the remittances began. This is not only the case when the exchange rate declines, but also when the exchange rate rises before April of last year. For example, when the exchange rate rose before April of last year, in order to take care of overseas Chinese, in addition to the general exchange rate, a preferential exchange rate for overseas remittances, which was usually about 5% higher than the general exchange rate, was also established. All of this shows that the People's Government, on the issue of exchange rates, as in many other issues, has consistently implemented the policy of facilitating overseas remittances as stipulated in the Common Program.

　　资本主义国家的货币贬值和我国的外汇牌价问题
    夏鸣
    最近两个多月以来，外汇牌价又连续降低四次。有些侨胞因为不明了整个情况，认为牌价降得过低，使他们吃亏，曾提出一些意见。他们认为：国内物价没有落那样多，牌价为什么调低那样多呢？有时港币黑市高过牌价，他们便认为牌价过低了，从银行汇款吃亏了。现在的外汇牌价是否偏低？侨胞是否吃了亏？这个问题可以从下面这些情况中得到解答。
            年来我国物价下降百分之四强
            美国物价上涨近百分之五十
    去年三月以来，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义及其附庸国家，由于疯狂备战，通货膨胀，物价急剧上涨，特别在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，上述国家的物价上涨尤速。根据莫迪氏物价指数，美国物价以去年三月份为一百，今年二月中旬已达一百四十九点五，上涨近百分之五十（在发动侵略朝鲜战争后的半年内即上涨百分之三十三）；英国物价，根据Ｕ·Ｋ·物价指数，同期内上涨百分之三十点四；香港物价涨风更见炽烈，如以上涨最猛的我国在港进口物价来说，去年十二月份涨达三月份的百分之一百九十三点七，上涨几近一倍；日本官方发表，自美帝国主义发动侵朝战争到今年二月九日，物价上升百分之五十以上；华侨集中的南洋地区，也饱受物价上涨的痛苦，例如印尼去年十月份物价即比前年十二月份涨百分之六十。所以连联合国发表的一篇《世界经济报告》也不能不承认：“全世界（指资本主义世界）所碰到的经济问题，主要是通货膨胀的威胁和日益逼近的货物荒。”
    这样，生活在美、英帝国主义国家及其殖民地的侨胞，他们辛勤劳动所得，一年中就被帝国主义政府在通货膨胀中无形攫取了很多。这一点，是国内许多侨眷所不能深切体会的。
    我国情况恰好相反，自去年三月统一财政经济工作以后，物价即转趋稳定。全国批发物价总指数，以去年三月份为一百，今年二月中旬为九十五点五，非但没有上涨，而且下跌百分之四点五，反映生活费的折实储蓄牌价指数，同期内下降百分之十。
    因此，为了摆脱帝国主义国家货币贬值对我国的影响，巩固我国金融物价的稳定，提高本币对外的购买力，及时降低外汇牌价是十分必要的。为此，中国银行在去年四月份降低外汇牌价四次（美汇从四万二千元降至三万七千五百元），去年七月份起至目前止，我国物价始终保持平稳，而资本主义国家货币继续急剧贬值，因此，外汇牌价又陆续降低八次（美汇从三万七千五百元降至二万二千八百九十元）。前后共降低了十二次，美汇从四万二千元降至二万二千八百九十元，降低百分之四十五，港汇从六千四百六十元降至三千八百八十元，降低百分之四十。
            及时降低外汇牌价
            摆脱外币落价影响
    及时降低外汇牌价，对摆脱外币落价影响，巩固本币币值，是起了很大作用的。这从历次牌价降低中可以看得很明显。如去年九月初国外物价上涨，影响到国内物价也随着上涨，但在九月六日汇价降低百分之三点七后，国内物价不仅立即停止上涨，而且下跌百分之六。去年天津进口货在港价格（以一九四九年十二月底为基期，根据马口铁、紫铜丝、药品、橡胶等二十一种进口物品价格编定的指数）由六月份的六十八点一涨至十二月份的一百五十二点三，上涨百分之一百二十三，在天津，同期内由一百五十四点四涨至二百七十七点九，仅涨百分之八十。今年一月间香港五金大涨，影响广州也随着上涨，但自一月二十日降低汇价后，广州五金涨风就告停止。这些都是很好的例证。
    去年十二月美帝国主义实行对我国全面禁运与冻结我国在美资金后，外汇牌价下降幅度较大：两个月内降低了四分之一以上。是否降得太多，使侨胞吃亏呢？我们研究的结果是：目前汇价并不偏低，反之，从目前的进出口情况说，还有些偏高。这可从以下几方面来看：
    从进口利润来看：进口利润的大小，是测量汇价高低的标志之一。如进口无利，即表示汇价偏高，反之，进口利润过大，即表示汇价偏低。去年十二月以来，我进口货物的国外价格上涨益烈，尤以香港为甚。香港进口物价指数从去年十二月上旬的一百六十八点九涨至今年二月上旬的二百三十，上涨达百分之三十七点三，最高如西药等上涨达五倍以上；而同期国内进口物价仅涨百分之七点四（天津），远远落在国外价格后面，以致进口利润减少。因此，表现在目前易货上，一反过去进口贴补出口而为出口贴补进口，如天津易货中甲类贴水（出口贴进口，下同）为百分之五，乙类百分之三至四，丙类百分之二，最高如上海薄荷脑贴水曾达百分之十五。
            鼓励出口照顾侨胞
            现行牌价略为偏高
    从出口利润来看：出口利润与外汇牌价的关系正好与进口利润相反。自去年年底以来，由于我国对外贸易正在转变之中，出口减少，同时国外资本主义市场又闹原料荒，以致我出口货的国外价格空前高涨：一般出口货的国外价格约涨百分之二十左右，最高如五倍子涨百分之七十二，花生仁涨百分之三十九，地毯涨百分之二十五；而国内则由于出口减少而落价，同期内天津出口物价指数落百分之十四。个别物资有落百分之三十者，因此，各地出口利润平均达百分之十三弱，青岛、天津均达百分之十七，个别物资有达百分之三十七者。国家银行决定外汇牌价时，是照顾到大部分的出口物资使能获得利润的。因此，出口商才能在易货中贴补进口商。这说明目前汇价并不偏低。
    从对侨胞的照顾来看：目前海外各地侨汇绝大部分是经香港汇入国内的，如果拿香港、广州两地人民生活必需品的价格对比来衡量汇价高低，可以看到目前汇价也不是偏低而是偏高的。下面是一张二月一日香港、广州货币购买力对照表：
    物品      港价（元）   单位        同值港币汇穗后可买数量
    大米          六八·三一        一担      二·三○担
    生油            一·九二        一斤      一·一三斤
    青菜            ○·二五        一斤      一·六二斤
    猪肉            三·二五        一斤      一·九四斤
    鸡蛋            ○·二○        一个      一·五五个
    松柴            七·五○        一担      一·四六担
    肥皂            二·二○        一条      二·五四条
    房租          五○·○○        一间      一·六二间
    布            八五·○○        一匹      ○·六一匹
    白糖            ○·五四        一斤      ○·三二斤
    水              ○·八○        一立方公尺  一·三八立方公尺
    电              ○·三三        一度          ○·五二度
    从上表十二种日用必需品的对比中，可以看出：按照现行牌价，用同样的钱在广州能买到的货物比香港要多，这完全说明现行港汇牌价不仅符合两地物价水平，而且略有偏高。如果以加权平均指数计算，目前港汇牌价应该降至三千零九十四元，比现行牌价还要降低百分之二十。由此可见，现行牌价是充分照顾了侨眷生活的。同时中国银行现在推行的人民币汇款（即从国外汇来时就折成人民币汇，在国内按人民币数兑付）是可以免除侨胞在汇兑过程中遭受汇价下降的影响的。各地中国银行办理的人民币侨汇已占整个汇款的百分之三十至七十，且在继续增加中，可见这一办法已得到侨胞的拥护。
    从上述出口、进口、侨汇等几方面看来，目前外汇牌价并不偏低，而是充分照顾了侨胞利益的。在帝国主义货币日益贬值声中，为稳定国内物价及保护全体人民的利益，降低汇价是完全必要的措施。而侨胞所受的损失，是在国外汇款之前，即已因外币贬值，不知不觉地被帝国主义及其殖民地政府攫取去了，所以汇价的挂低，乃是外币贬值后的结果；而国家银行从侨胞一开始汇款起，即保护了侨胞在国内的实际所得。这不仅在汇价下降时如此，即在去年四月以前汇价上升时也是如此。如去年四月以前汇价上升时，为了照顾侨胞，除一般汇价外，更订定经常高出一般牌价百分之五左右的侨汇优待牌价。所有这些都说明人民政府在外汇牌价问题上，也和在其他许多问题上一样，一贯执行着共同纲领所规定的便利侨汇的政策的。
