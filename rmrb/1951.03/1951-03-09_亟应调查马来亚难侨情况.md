　　Urgent Need to Investigate the Situation of Malayan Refugees

    The recently established Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees has now decided to organize a refugee investigation team to go to Malaya to investigate the suffering of overseas Chinese there. This is a just action by the people of the motherland who deeply care about overseas Chinese; we warmly support this just action.
    The more than 2.8 million overseas Chinese, who make up almost half of the entire population of Malaya, have a long history of pioneering and developing Malaya, and have a glorious record of fighting alongside the people of Malaya to resist the fascist Japanese invaders. But they have long suffered bloody persecution by the ungrateful British colonialists!
    The British imperialists' recent barbaric and appalling crimes of persecuting overseas Chinese in Malaya have aroused universal indignation among the Chinese people. Our people have unanimously demanded that the British colonialists immediately stop the persecution of overseas Chinese and guarantee all their legitimate rights and interests. However, the British colonial authorities, disregarding the repeated protests and warnings from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government and various democratic parties and people's organizations, have continued to adopt a criminal policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and persecution of overseas Chinese.
    Now the refugee investigation team organized by the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees is about to go to Malaya to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. We believe that any kind British person who is willing to live in peace with the Chinese people will share our hope for the success of this investigation team, and the British colonial authorities in Malaya must not use any excuse to obstruct the right of the investigation team formed by our people's organizations to conduct a full investigation.

　　亟应调查马来亚难侨情况
    最近成立的中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会，现在决定组织难侨调查团，到马来亚调查当地华侨受难的情况。这是祖国人民深切关怀海外侨胞的正义行动；我们热烈拥护这个正义行动。
    几乎占马来亚全部人口一半的二百八十余万华侨，有着披荆斩棘开拓马来亚的悠久历史，有着与马来亚人民并肩作战、抵抗法西斯日本侵略者的光荣功绩。但他们却长期地遭受着忘恩负义的英国殖民者的血腥迫害！
    英帝国主义最近迫害马来亚华侨的野蛮的和惨绝人寰的罪行，已经激起中国人民普遍的愤慨。我国人民曾一致要求英国殖民者立即停止对华侨的迫害，并保障华侨的一切正当权益。但英国殖民当局不顾我中央人民政府外交部和各民主党派、各人民团体多次提出的抗议和警告，竟继续采取敌视中国人民、迫害华侨的罪恶政策。
    现在中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会所组织的难侨调查团就要到马来亚进行实地调查去了。我们相信，任何愿意与中国人和平相处的善良的英国人，一定会和我们同样盼望这个调查团的成功，而马来亚的英国殖民当局，也决不能以任何借口来阻挠我国人民团体所组成的调查团进行充分调查的权利。
