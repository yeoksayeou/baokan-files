　　Swiftly Eliminate Animal Epidemics and Ensure Spring Plowing

　　Since the beginning of spring, various livestock epidemics have been spreading in vast areas. This is currently the biggest obstacle hindering our victorious spring plowing and deserves serious attention from party and government leading organs at all levels.

　　The livestock epidemics currently spreading are mainly foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, hemorrhagic septicemia, anthrax, and blackleg. Although the mortality rate of foot-and-mouth disease is not high (about 0.5%), infected cattle suffer from ulcerated mouths and hooves, rendering them unable to plow for about a month, and it spreads extremely quickly. The scope of its spread has now expanded to certain areas within the seven provinces of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Xikang, and Shanxi. Rinderpest, septicemia, anthrax, and blackleg have very high mortality rates and spread very rapidly. They have currently occurred in several areas in the provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou. If these livestock epidemics are not eliminated promptly, they will affect the cultivation of millions of acres of farmland. This is a major issue concerning the interests of millions of people. All people's governments in areas where livestock epidemics have occurred should immediately lead the local people to take the following emergency measures to swiftly eliminate the epidemics:

　　(1) Blockade epidemic areas to prevent the spread. In areas where livestock epidemics have occurred or are prevalent, epidemic areas (provinces, special districts, counties, districts, or villages) should be designated according to the scope of occurrence and prevalence. The masses should be mobilized to implement strict blockades to curb the spread and eliminate the epidemics locally. Quarantine stations should be established at the borders of epidemic areas to strictly prevent livestock from entering or leaving the borders. Cattle, sheep, pigs, camels, and their products such as fresh meat, hides, bones, and wool within the blockaded area should be prohibited from being transported out of the area, unless they have been injected, disinfected, and possess a quarantine certificate. In provinces with severe epidemics, such transportation should be designated to specific routes, and stations should be set up for strict inspection.

　　(2) Prevent infection and pay attention to livestock health. Livestock infected with epidemics should be immediately isolated, and hygiene and maintenance work should be strengthened. In epidemic areas and their adjacent border areas, livestock sheds, livestock equipment, livestock excrement, livestock stations, and livestock markets should be disinfected at all times (using lime water, wood ash, or the clear liquid from soaking animal manure ash). Livestock in epidemic villages that have not yet shown symptoms should also avoid contact with livestock from neighboring villages during plowing to reduce the possibility of introducing epidemics into neighboring villages. After the death of infected livestock, hides and bones are strictly prohibited from being thrown into rivers, and they should be disinfected. Meat and internal organs must also be cooked thoroughly on the spot, and manure must be fermented before it can be used.

　　(3) Actively carry out medical prevention and treatment. In addition to organizing Western veterinarians to inject for prevention and treatment, traditional Chinese veterinarians should also be mobilized and organized to actively participate in this work. Hold symposiums for traditional Chinese and Western veterinarians to exchange experiences, inspire the publication of ancestral secret formulas. Once effective and proven prescriptions are discovered in various places, they should be vigorously disseminated so that they can be introduced to other epidemic areas for learning and application.

　　(4) In order to complete the task of swiftly eliminating livestock epidemics, epidemic prevention committees or headquarters should be established in major administrative regions, provinces, special districts, counties, and even districts and villages where livestock epidemics have occurred. They should promptly issue livestock epidemic reports, uniformly direct prevention and treatment work, and especially organize all parties to cooperate in this serious task of blockading epidemic areas.

　　Spring plowing is imminent. Eliminating livestock epidemics in epidemic areas has become the most urgent and serious task in current agricultural production. It is hoped that the people's governments of all epidemic areas will immediately, according to local conditions, mobilize the masses and vigorously promote prevention and treatment work. Although the current livestock epidemics have a wide range of prevalence, it is believed that the current prevalent livestock epidemics can be completely overcome if the power of the broad masses of peasants is mobilized, and a livestock epidemic prevention and treatment movement is launched in a led, planned, and technically guided manner.

### 迅速扑灭畜疫，保证进行春耕

　　迅速扑灭畜疫，保证进行春耕
    入春以来，各种牲畜疫病在广大地区内流行，这是目前阻碍我们胜利进行春耕的一个最大障碍，值得各地党政领导机关严重注意。
    这次流行的畜疫，主要是口蹄疫、牛瘟、出血性败血症、牛炭疽和气肿疽。口蹄疫虽然死亡率不大（约千分之五），但疫牛口蹄溃烂，约有一月不能耕作，且传染极快，现蔓延范围已扩及新疆、青海、宁夏、陕西、绥远、西康、山西七省内某些地区。牛瘟、败血症、炭疽和气肿疽死亡率很大，传染也极迅速。目前在山西、绥远、河北、河南、湖北、湖南、广西、四川、贵州等省的若干地区均已发生。这些畜疫如不及早消灭，则将影响到千百万亩田地的耕种。这是一个关系着千百万人民利益的重大问题，一切发生畜疫地区的人民政府，应即领导当地人民采取如下紧急措施，迅速扑灭畜疫。
    （一）封锁疫区防止蔓延。凡畜疫发生或已流行地区，应根据发生和流行范围划定疫区（省、专区、县、区、或村），发动群众实行严密封锁，遏止蔓延，就地扑灭。在疫区边境应设立检疫站，严防牲畜出入边界。封锁区内的牛羊猪骆驼及其鲜肉皮骨毛等产品，除经注射消毒领有检疫证者外，应禁止运输出境。在疫情严重的省份，此类运输应指定路线，并设站严格检查。
    （二）防止传染，注意牲畜健康。牲畜染疫，应即隔离，并加强卫生保养工作。疫区和与其邻接的边缘地区，畜舍、牲畜用具、牲畜排出物、牲畜行栈、牲畜市场，均应随时进行消毒（可用石灰水，草木灰，或畜粪灰水浸沉清液）。畜疫村尚未呈露病征的牲畜，在耕作时也不要与邻村牲畜接触，以减少疫病传入邻村的可能。疫畜死后，皮骨严禁投入河中，应使之消毒，肉及脏腑也须就地煮熟，粪便须经发酵后方可利用。
    （三）积极进行医药防治。除组织西兽医注射防治外，并应动员和组织中兽医积极参加这一工作。召开中西兽医座谈会，彼此交流经验，启发公布祖传秘方。各地一经发现有效验方，应即大力传播。以便介绍给其他疫区学习运用。
    （四）为完成迅速扑灭畜疫的任务，发生畜疫的各大行政区、省、专区、县、以至区和村，均应成立防治畜疫委员会或指挥部，及时发出畜疫情报，统一指挥防治工作，特别是封锁疫区，更要组织各方力量配合这一严重任务。
    春耕迫在眉睫，在疫区扑灭畜疫已成为当前农业生产中最紧急最严重的任务。希望各疫区的人民政府立即根据当地情况，发动群众，雷厉风行地推进防治工作。这次畜疫虽然流行范围广阔，但如果把广大的农民群众的力量发动起来，有领导地有计划地并有技术指导地掀起畜疫防治运动，相信目前流行的畜疫是完全可以战胜的。
