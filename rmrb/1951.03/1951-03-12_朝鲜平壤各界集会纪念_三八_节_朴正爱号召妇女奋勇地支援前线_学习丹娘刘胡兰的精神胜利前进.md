Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 10th: A Pyongyang Municipal People's Gathering commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day was held on the evening of the 7th under the auspices of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union. Participants in the meeting included Korean Deputy Prime Minister Park Heon-young, Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Heo Ga-i, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Heo Heon, representatives of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, various democratic parties, social organizations, and organizations at all levels of the Korean Democratic Women's Union. Female combat hero Kim Kang-sook, who was awarded the third-class National Flag Medal, also participated in the conference and received a warm welcome from the audience.

Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, delivered a report to the conference. She pointed out that the women of the Republic have consistently carried out unremitting struggles in the Fatherland Liberation War. Since the beginning of the war, more than 344,200 women have signed up to join the army or participate in nursing work; 31,366 women have participated in wartime production. In the Hungnam area, 172 female workers were commended by the government of the Republic. Rural women replaced their husbands and children who went to the front lines, actively participating in agricultural production and rear area restoration and transportation. In the first two months of the war, women contributed more than 800,200 consolation items and a large number of non-staple foods to the People's Army.

Park Chung-ae continued: When the American aggressors and the Lee Seung-man bandit army temporarily invaded the northern region, they massacred labor party members, trade union members, members of the Democratic Youth League, and members of the Democratic Women's Union and their families everywhere, and massacred children in large numbers. However, the enemy's atrocities failed to conquer the Korean people and Korean women, but instead further increased the Korean people's and Korean women's hatred of the enemy. Park Chung-ae finally called on all Korean women to learn from the heroic struggle of the Soviet Union's Danya and China's Liu Hulan, hold high the banner of justice, closely unite around the government of the Republic, replace their husbands and sons who went to the front lines, participate in restoration work and spring plowing work, further expand the work of supporting the front lines, and strengthen unity with the Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people all over the world, and march forward victoriously.

When representatives of the Pyongyang Municipal Young Pioneers entered the venue waving red flags to congratulate the mothers, warm applause and cheers rang out throughout the venue.

The conference unanimously adopted congratulatory telegrams to General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin.

　　朝鲜平壤各界集会纪念“三八”节
    朴正爱号召妇女奋勇地支援前线
    学习丹娘刘胡兰的精神胜利前进
    【新华社平壤十日电】平壤市各界纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会，于七日晚在朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会主持下举行。参加大会者有朝鲜内阁副首相朴宪永、劳动党中央委员会副委员长许嘉谊、最高人民会议议长许宪及祖国统一民主主义战线、各民主政党、社会团体、朝鲜民主妇女同盟各级组织代表。荣获三级国旗勋章的女战斗英雄金刚淑也参加了大会，受到全场的热烈欢迎。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱向大会作了报告。她指出：共和国全体妇女，在祖国解放战争中，一贯进行着不懈的斗争。战争开始以来，已有三十四万四千二百余名妇女报名参加军队或参加看护工作；有三万一千三百六十六名妇女参加了战时生产工作。兴南地区有一百七十二名女工，荣获共和国政府的表扬。农村妇女代替了上前线的丈夫和孩子，积极参加农业生产和后方的恢复、运输工作。在战争的最初两个月中，妇女们献给人民军的慰劳品达八十万零二百余件及大批副食品。
    朴正爱继称：当美国侵略军和李承晚匪军暂时侵入北部地区后，他们到处屠杀劳动党员、工会会员、民主青年同盟盟员和民主妇女同盟盟员及其家属，并大批残杀儿童。但是，敌人的暴行未能征服朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女，反而更加提高了朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女的敌忾。朴正爱最后号召全朝鲜妇女学习苏联的丹娘和中国的刘胡兰英勇斗争的精神，高举正义的旗帜，紧紧地团结在共和国政府的周围，代替上前线的丈夫和儿子，参加恢复工作和春耕工作，进一步展开支援前线的工作，并加强与苏联、中国及全世界爱好和平的人民的团结，胜利前进。
    当平壤市少年团代表举着红旗，进入会场向母亲们祝贺的时候，全场响起了热烈的鼓掌声与欢呼声。
    大会最后一致通过了给金日成将军、毛泽东主席和斯大林大元帅的致敬电。
