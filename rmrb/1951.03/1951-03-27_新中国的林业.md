　　Forestry in New China
    Minister of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government Liang Xi

　　Great motherland! With a population of 475 million, exceeding the total population of all countries in North and South America; a land area of 9,597,000 square kilometers, second only to the Soviet Union; and a credible history of more than 3,000 years, it is a world-renowned ancient country.
　　Great mountains! Eighty-six percent of the country's land is above 500 meters above sea level, earning it the reputation of a "mountain country." The source of the Yangtze River, winding for tens of thousands of miles, is located in the west and south, where peaks rise and snow mountains overlap. Among them is the world's highest peak, higher than 8,800 meters, discovered by the Chinese as early as 1717, but 175 years later, the British wrote their own name on it and called it "Everest" – the Holy Mother of Water Peak (Mount Everest). People who go to Sichuan or Xikang, standing beside the Yangtze River or the Jinsha River, can proudly sing Du Fu's poem: "The window frames the Western Mountains' snow for a thousand autumns, the door faces the ships sailing ten thousand miles to Eastern Wu."
　　Great forest plants! On our motherland's land, there are two forest plant belts, vertically distributed in central Taiwan and horizontally distributed from Hainan Island in the south to Heilongjiang in the north, including tropical, warm, temperate, and cold zones. There is the Taiwan fir, whose height is second only to the world's sequoia, and the red cypress, whose trunk is second only to the world's sequoia (both compared among the world's conifers). There is the "Sacred Tree" of Alishan, which is three thousand years old and still alive, longer than the Han cypress, Tang pine, Six Dynasties pine, and the "Tree King" conferred by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty on Tianmu Mountain. There are more than 5,000 species of woody plants growing throughout the country, exceeding the number of tree species in any other country in the world. There are about 50 species of trees unique to China and not found in other countries, such as golden larch, Taiwan fir, dawn redwood, dove tree, eucommia, and Davidia involucrata. Even in the last seven or eight years, a new species has appeared in Wanxian, Sichuan, which is the dawn redwood, jointly published by Professor Zheng Wanjun of Nanjing University and Professor Hu Xiansu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and has become famous overseas. In addition, tung oil trees, oil-tea camellias, lacquer trees, Chinese tallow trees, white wax trees, camphor trees, lychee trees, etc., which produce special forest products, have significant economic value.
　　Vast land, ancient history, large population, many mountains, many tree species, and abundant products. As a people, growing up on the land of such a great motherland, climbing a thousand-ren cliff, overlooking ten thousand miles of flowing water, what a magnificent view, what a broad mind, how lovable is the motherland.
　　The people's motherland should be governed by the people, the people's rivers and mountains should be managed by the people, and similarly, the people's forests should be protected by the people, and the people's tree species should be cultivated by the people.
　　No one will steal the trees cultivated by the people, and no one will destroy the forests managed by the people, just as no one dares to lay a finger on the rivers and mountains controlled by the people, and no one dares to invade the country governed by the people.
　　The people refer to independent, autonomous people, not semi-feudal and semi-colonial people. If they are semi-feudal and semi-colonial people, then 80% or 90% of the vast majority are exploited and oppressed, groaning under the tyranny of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, struggling in the face of corrupt officials, local tyrants, evil gentry, knives, soldiers, water, drought, wind, sand, pests, and other natural and man-made disasters. Every year, countless farmers are forced to flee to the source of water and the top of mountains, desperately burning wasteland, recklessly cultivating land, planting buckwheat, growing corn, digging grass roots, destroying precious forests, and damaging fertile soil. In turn, this exacerbates the disasters of water, drought, wind, and sand in downstream areas, creating millions of displaced victims again, who are forced to burn wasteland and recklessly cultivate land in the mountains. This cycle repeats itself, the mountains become increasingly bare, the poor become more and more numerous, and what mood is there to protect and plant forests?
　　Forestry in New China has suffered a great loss from this congenital deficiency. What the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek government left us, apart from some surviving natural forests in sparsely populated areas, were: more than 400 million mu of boundless barren mountains, timber merchants who speculated and manipulated the timber market, headmen who exploited the mountain people by trickery and coercion, and even the bad habits of indiscriminate felling, theft, burning mountains, and cultivating mountains. We have taken over this mess, and the responsibility is very heavy, and the work is very arduous.
　　For example, in February 1950, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, at the National Forestry Business Conference, assigned a national afforestation task of more than 1.77 million mu. By the end of the year, 1.63 million mu had been completed, plus 334 million scattered trees had been planted, which had exceeded the task. We cannot but say that cadres at all levels have worked very hard. However, compared with the vast area of barren mountains, the afforestation achievements are insignificant.
　　Forest protection work is even more inadequate. In 1950, the country lost 2.6 million cubic meters of timber due to fires. Compared with the 4 million cubic meters of standing timber destroyed in 1949, although it has been reduced by 35%, reducing only 35% from such a shockingly large number is still a serious problem.
　　Forestry survey is the basic work of forestry. In 1950, in addition to the Northeast mobilizing more than 2,000 forestry cadres to complete the forest land survey of more than 4 million cubic meters of stock volume, Inner Mongolia in the Greater Khingan Mountains, North China in Tuoling and the Yongding River Basin, Northwest in the Tao River, Xiaolong Mountain, the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains, and the Tianshan Mountains, and other regions such as Central South, East China, and Southwest also combined with other agencies and schools to do more or less survey work and obtained a lot of information. However, the biggest questions facing us are: Is China's suitable afforestation land more than 400 million mu? Is the total forest area more than 1.39 billion mu? Is the total timber stock volume more than 51 billion cubic meters? We still cannot answer. If we cannot answer, how can we make a nationwide management plan? Therefore, the forest survey work is still far from our goal.
　　Logging and timber transportation occupy an extremely important position in the Northeast. In 1950, more than 128,000 farmers used 93,991 head of livestock to complete the task of felling more than 4 million cubic meters of timber ahead of schedule. Including Inner Mongolia and Shanxi, the total amount of timber felled by state-owned enterprises in 1950 was 4.5 million cubic meters. These timber stocks are currently in short supply, not to mention that the construction upsurge in New China is about to arrive, and the consumption of timber will inevitably increase by leaps and bounds. How can we supply it?
　　Looking at these problems in such a great era, the above work and figures do not amount to any achievements.
　　It is worth pointing out that: For more than a year, cadres at the central and major regional and provincial levels, based on long-term practical work, have exchanged experiences through numerous meetings, reached a consensus, and found a way to develop forestry in New China, which is the mass line that Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us. Because everyone has realized that: in China, the earlier the liberation, the faster the land reform, the higher the masses' awareness, the easier it is to persuade, mobilize, and organize them, and to exert great ability and show great achievements in a vigorous manner. This is true for forest protection, afforestation, and logging.
　　(1) Relying on the masses for forest protection: In 1950, fire accounted for 92.8% of the total timber loss of 2.8 million cubic meters due to forest destruction. Fire is the most terrible thing in the forest. The land is vast, the wind is strong, and the trees themselves are fuel. It is true that "a single spark can start a prairie fire." Last year, the fire in Arshan, Inner Mongolia, burned for more than ten days, and the fire in the Bayan Forest Area burned for twelve days. It is not easy to extinguish without relying on the masses. In 1950, the number of people mobilized to fight fires ranged from a thousand to tens of thousands. For example, in April, fires broke out simultaneously in the mountainous areas of seven counties in Jilin Province. The chairman of the provincial government personally led 200 cadres and mobilized 20,000 people to finally put out the fire. The fire in Yabuli District, Shangzhi County, Songjiang, was entirely rescued by more than 400 people, and the forest was not burned, which shows the strength of the masses. Recently, the Northeast and Inner Mongolia have done further work to rely on the strength of the masses, from "fire fighting" to "fire prevention." In addition to deploying a series of political and technical measures, they have strengthened publicity and education, improved forest protection organizations, and formulated fire prevention covenants to make the masses regard fire prevention as their own task. Therefore, the loss from mountain fires in 1950 was reduced by 35% compared with 1949, and even the Oroqen people, who were historically accustomed to burning wasteland, have gradually changed.
　　(2) Relying on the masses for afforestation: Forestry in New China has changed from the old style of "defending isolated strongholds and relying on a few workers" in old forest farms to mobilizing the masses. This is a major shift. Under the principle of combining the interests of the masses, we first carry out publicity and education, followed by meticulous organization, plus technical guidance, and more reliance on party and government leadership and labor models to take the lead, to launch a wide range of competitions and make the masses act consciously and voluntarily. In 1950, western Henan did a good job in afforestation on sandy wasteland in this way; Jiaodong did a good job in afforestation on barren mountains in this way; western Hebei used this method to mobilize more than 102,000 people in the spring to complete more than 60,000 mu of protective forest networks; western Liaoning used this method to mobilize 250,000 people and achieved afforestation of more than 16 million trees in the province. The strength of the masses is amazing: from the annual Arbor Day in the old China to the afforestation in three seasons of the year in the new China, from planting trees in front of each house to developing cooperative afforestation, from scattered tree planting in villages to improving to large-scale afforestation. This has given hope to thousands of mu of suitable afforestation land.
　　(3) Relying on the masses for logging: Because the workers in New China appear with the attitude of masters, because the feudal headman exploitation system has been completely overthrown, because the workers' welfare undertakings have been improved year by year, and more because of the adoption of the Soviet Union's new system of engineering quotas and production quotas, more than 100,000 workers have issued unparalleled enthusiasm, used the greatest strength, and emerged many labor models such as Li Guoyou and Liu Jingui, thereby increasing output and reducing costs. In 1950, there were brilliant achievements. The working period was shortened: the logging task was completed on March 10, earlier than in previous years. The transportation task was only 77% completed in 1949, while in 1950 it was all transported out by mid-August. The logging method has also been improved: In the past, workers were afraid of suffering and stood to fell trees, and the felling roots were as high as 70 cm, which was wasteful. In 1950, they knelt down to fell trees, and the felling roots were lowered to 30 cm above the ground, thereby saving 250,000 cubic meters of timber. In the past, workers did not cherish the top wood and cut it off casually. In 1950, it was stipulated that tree tops above 6 cm must be utilized, saving 50,000 cubic meters of timber. In addition, the increase in the amount of work, the reduction in the loss rate of transportation, and the increase in the amount of timber transportation by forest railways are certainly closely related to political leadership and technical improvement, but without the high efforts of the working masses, there could be no such achievements.
　　Forestry in 1950 was the first step on a long journey. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's mass line, be down-to-earth, and walk accurately, steadily, and closely step by step, all good conditions belong to us. Abundant products require us to improve varieties and methods. Many forest plants allow us to select the most economical and suitable local tree species for afforestation everywhere. Many mountains allow forestry workers to have great use of their abilities, even if they are barren mountains. And a large population is the source of great labor force, and the conditions are even better.
　　Let's go! Let us move forward steadily, let us aim at the target. In front of us are:
　　Four major tasks: Forest protection, afforestation, forest management, and forest utilization.
　　A bright avenue: The mass line.
　　A beautiful vision: To make every mountain green, every river clear, flowers fragrant in all seasons, birds singing in ten thousand valleys, to dress the rivers and mountains into brocade, and to paint the country into a masterpiece. The foresters of New China are also the artists of New China.

　　新中国的林业
    中央人民政府林垦部部长  梁希
    伟大的祖国！人口四亿七千五百万，超过南北美洲各国人口的总和；国土九百五十九万七千平方公里，仅次于苏联；信实的历史三千多年，为世界有名的古国。
    伟大的山！全国百分之八十六的土地都在海拔五百公尺以上，以“山国”名于世。而蜿蜒万里长的长江上游水源地的西面和南面，则峰峦起伏，雪山重叠，其中更有高过八千八百公尺，在一七一七年早被中国人发现，而过了一百七十五年，反被英国人写上了自己的名字叫做“额非尔士”的这样一座高高无比的世界第一高峰——圣母之水峰（珠穆朗玛峰）。人们到了四川或西康，站在沿长江或金沙江旁边的地方，可以骄傲地歌唱杜甫的诗：“窗含西岭千秋雪，门对东吴万里船”。
    伟大的森林植物！在我们祖国的国土上，有垂直分布于台湾中部，更有水平分布于南自海南岛北至黑龙江的热、暖、温、寒的两种森林植物带。有树身之高仅次于世界爷（Sequoia）的台湾杉，树干之大仅次于世界爷的红桧（以上两种均就世界针叶树比较）。有树龄已到三千年而现在还活着的阿里山“神木”，比民间相传说的汉柏、唐松、六朝松和清帝乾隆在天目山所封的“树王”还寿长。有生长在全国的木本植物五千多种，超过世界上任何一国的树种数目。有外国所无而中国独有的乔木约五十种，例如金钱松、台湾杉、水松、珙桐、杜仲、香果树等；即在最近七、八年，四川万县还出现了新种，这就是由南京大学郑万钧教授和中国科学院胡先骕教授共同发表而扬名海外的水杉。此外，出产特种林产品的油桐、油茶、漆树、乌桕、白蜡树、樟树、荔树0等，经济上都有重大的价值。
    地大，历史古，人多，山多，树种多，物产多。作为一个人民，生长在这样伟大的祖国的国土上，上登千仞冈，下瞰万里流，洋洋大观，气魄何等雄壮，胸襟何等宽阔，祖国何等可爱。
    人民的祖国要人民来治，人民的江山要人民来管，同样，人民的森林要人民来保护，人民的树种要人民来栽培。
    人民栽培出来的树木没有人盗伐，人民保管起来的森林没有人破坏，正像人民掌握的江山谁也不敢染指，人民治理的国家谁也不敢侵犯一样。
    人民，指的是独立，自主的人民，而不是半封建半殖民地的人民。如果是半封建半殖民地的人民，则百分之八十或九十以上的绝大多数被剥削，被压迫，呻吟于封建主义帝国主义和官僚资本主义的淫威之下，挣扎在贪官污吏、土豪劣绅、刀、兵、水、旱、风、沙、病虫害等天灾与人祸之中，历年有无数农民被迫流亡到水之源山之顶，走头无路地烧荒、滥垦、种荞麦、栽包谷、挖草根、毁灭宝贵的森林，破坏肥沃的土壤。反过来又助长了下游地方的水、旱、风、沙的灾害，重新造成千百万流离失所的灾民，又被迫向山上烧荒和滥垦，如此循环反复，山皮越剥越光，穷人越来越多，那有什么心情来护林和造林？
    新中国的林业，就吃了这个先天不足的大亏，腐败的蒋介石政府所留给我们的，除掉人迹罕到的地方还有一些残存的天然林外，剩下来的是：四十多万万亩茫无边际的荒山，投机倒把操纵木市的木商，巧取豪夺剥削山民的把头，更留下滥伐盗伐烧山垦山的不良习惯。我们接收了这个烂摊子，责任非常重大，工作是非常艰巨的。
    譬如说，一九五○年二月，林垦部在全国林业业务会议上，布置了全国造林任务一七七万多亩，到年底完成了一六三万亩，再加上零星植树三亿三千四百万株，已经超过了任务，我们不能不说各级干部非常努力。但是这个数字，和广大的荒山面积相比较，则造林成绩渺不足道。
    护林工作更做得不够。一九五○年全国因火灾而损失的木材二百六十万立方公尺，与一九四九年烧毁立木四百万立方公尺相比，虽已减少了百分之三十五，可是从这样一个大得惊人的数目中，仅仅减少百分之三十五，问题还是严重。
    林野调查，是林业的基本工作。在一九五○年，除东北动员二千多林业干部，完成了四百多万立方公尺蓄积量的林地调查外，内蒙在大兴安岭，华北在驼岭和永定河流域，西北在洮河，小陇山，秦岭北坡及天山，此外如中南华东与西南也结合了其他机关、学校做了或多或少的调查工作，获得了不少资料。然而，摆在我们面前的几个最大的问题：中国宜林地是否四十多万万亩？森林总面积是否十三亿九千多万亩？木材总蓄积量是否五十一万万多立方公尺？我们仍然不能回答。不能回答，如何作出全国性的施业案来？所以，森林调查工作，离我们的目标也差得很远。
    伐木和运材，在东北占着极其重要的地位。一九五○年，有十二万八千多农民，使用九万三千九百九十一万头牲口，提前完成了四百余万立方公尺木材采伐的任务。加上内蒙和山西，总计一九五○年国营采伐的材量四百五十万立方公尺。这些材积在目前已感供不应求，何况新中国建设高潮快要到来，木材消费量势必突飞猛进，我们如何供应？
    在这样一个大时代里来看问题，上面这些工作，这些数字，都谈不到什么成绩。
    值得指出的是：一年多以来，中央和各大区、省各级干部，根据长时期的实际工作，经过无数次的会议，交流了经验，已得到一致的认识，找出了一条发展新中国林业的途径，这就是毛主席再三教导我们的群众路线。因为大家体会到：在中国，那里解放得早，那里土地改革得快，那里的群众觉悟就高，就容易说服、发动和组织起来，发挥出极大的能力，表现出轰轰烈烈的成绩，护林如此，造林如此，伐木也如此。
    （一）依靠群众护林：一九五○年因森林破坏而损失的二百八十万立方米总材量中，火灾占百分之九二·八。火，在森林中是最可怕的。地广，风大，树木本身就是燃料，真是“星星之火可以燎原”。内蒙阿尔山去年烧了十多天，巴彦林区烧了十二天，如果不依靠群众，是不易扑灭的。一九五○年为救火而动员的人数，少则一千人，多则数万人，例如吉林省在四月间有七个县的山区同时起火，省政府主席亲自率领二百干部，动员了二万人，终于把火扑灭。而松江尚志县牙不力区的火灾，则全靠四百多人紧急抢救，没有烧着林子，这说明了群众的力量。近来，东北和内蒙作了更进一步的工作，要靠群众的力量，从“救火”做到“防火”，除布置了一系列的政治上和技术上的措施外，更加强宣传教育，健全护林组织，订立防火公约，使群众把防火当作自己的任务。因此，一九五○年山火损失比一九四九年减少百分之三十五，连历史上习惯烧荒的鄂伦春人也渐渐改变过来。
    （二）依靠群众造林：新中国的林业，从旧时林场的“死守孤立据点，依赖少数工人”那一套旧作风，改变到发动群众，这是一个大转变。在结合群众利益的原则下，先进行宣传教育，继之以细密组织，加之以技术指导，更依靠党政领导，劳动模范带头，展开广泛的竞赛，使群众自觉自愿地行动起来。一九五○年，豫西就是这样搞好沙荒造林；胶东就是这样搞好山荒造林；冀西就是用这个方式在春季发动了十万二千多人，完成防护林网六万余亩；辽西就是用这个方式发动了二十五万人，获得了全省一千六百多万株的造林成绩。群众的力量是惊人的：从旧中国一年一度的植树节，进步到新中国一年三季造林，从各家的门前植树，发展到合作造林，从村庄零星植树，提高到整片造林。这就使得千千万万亩宜林地有了希望。
    （三）依靠群众采伐：由于新中国的工人以主人翁姿态出现，由于封建式把头剥削制根本推翻，由于工人福利事业逐年改进，更由于工程定额和生产定额那一套苏联新制度的采用，所以十多万工人发出了无比热忱，用出了最大力量，涌现出了李国有和刘金贵等许多劳动模范，从而产量增，成本减，一九五○年有了辉煌的成就。工作时期缩短了：伐木任务在三月十日完成，比往年提早。流送任务，在一九四九年只完成了百分之七十七，而一九五○年则在八月中旬已全部流出。伐木方式也改良了：过去工人怕吃苦，站着伐，伐根高到七十公分，浪费，而一九五○年则跪着伐，伐根降低到离地三十公分，由此节省木材二十五万立方米。过去工人不爱惜梢头木，随便砍去，一九五○年规定六公分以上的树梢必须利用，节省木材五万立方米。此外，如工程量的增高，流送损失率的减少，森林铁道木材运输量的加增等，固然与政治领导和技术改进都有密切关系，但没有劳动大众的高度努力，决不能有这样成就。
    一九五○年的林业，是万里征途上的第一步，只要依着毛主席的群众路线，脚踏实地，一步一步地走得准，走得稳，而且走得紧，则一切良好条件都是属于我们的。物产多，正需要我们来改良品种和制法。森林植物多，正好到处选出最经济最适合的乡土树种来造林。山多，林业工作者才大有用武之地，那怕是荒山。而人多正是伟大劳动力的来源，条件更好。
    走吧！让我们稳步前进，让我们对准目标，在我们面前有：
    四大任务：护林，造林，森林经理，森林利用。
    一条光明的大道：群众路线。
    一幅美丽的远景：要无山不绿，有水皆清，四时花香，万壑鸟鸣，替河山装成锦绣，把国土绘成丹青，新中国的林人，同时是新中国的艺人。
