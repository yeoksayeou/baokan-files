Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 14th – A group of 279 captured officers and soldiers of the American and British invading forces in a certain area of northern Korea, after a short period of education by the Chinese People's Volunteers, have begun to recognize the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea and expressed their willingness to strive for lasting world peace. On February 11th, they voluntarily held a Peace Advocacy Conference and adopted an appeal to the United Nations. The appeal condemned the disasters caused by American and British imperialism in Korea and protested the United Nations' illegal passage of a resolution slandering the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor."

These officers and soldiers, originally belonging to the 1st Marine Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 3rd Infantry Division of the American invading army, and the 41st Independent Commando of the British Royal Marines, quickly realized, under the influence of the lenient policy of the Korean People and the Chinese People's Volunteers towards prisoners of war, that they had been fooled by the American and British warmongers in the past and felt ashamed of their participation in this bloody crime. At an evening party, Staff Sergeant Olsen, of the 1st Battalion, 31st Regiment of the former US 7th Infantry Division, said with great sorrow: "Our hands are stained with the blood of innocent people. How should we repay the generosity of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people towards us? We can never repay the terrible losses they have suffered, but we can still do our best to make some compensation: First, we should strive to learn the truth, and second, we can write a peace appeal asking the United Nations to accept the proposals for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue put forward by the government of the People's Republic of China. This is the only road to peace in the Far East." His proposal was quickly echoed by all the prisoners. Corporal Driver Maffeoli, of the Logistics Company of the 1st Tank Battalion of the former US Marine 1st Division, said: "For peace, for our own happiness, we must participate in the call for peace." Subsequently, they studied the "Declaration to the People of the World" of the Second World Peace Congress and the Stockholm Peace Appeal and unanimously requested to hold a Peace Advocacy Conference. They democratically elected a preparatory committee to actively prepare.

On February 11th, the Peace Advocacy Conference was held. The conference was presided over by Hammond, a Private 2nd Class of the 69th Chemical Smoke Screen Company of the former US Tenth Corps. Major McLaughlin, a liaison officer of the former US Tenth Corps, spoke at the meeting. He first asked: "How many people really know the real reason why we were sent to Korea?" The whole audience shouted: "No one knows!" Then he described the process of his ideological change after being captured. He said, "The Chinese People's Volunteers have educated us with the truth: the Third World War brewing in the United States is increasingly threatening humanity. We should take action." British soldier Coundren said: "Signing for peace is only our first step." Then many people spoke enthusiastically. They were extremely angry at the warmongers for sending them to Korea to carry out a war of aggression and expressed their willingness to strive for lasting world peace. Finally, all 279 prisoners present unanimously passed the appeal to the United Nations and signed it. In his final speech, the staff of the Volunteer Army, in addition to encouraging their progress, hoped that they would continue to work hard for the cause of peace from now on. After the representative of the Volunteer Army finished speaking, the prisoners stood up and cheered.

　　在我志愿军教育下开始认识侵略罪恶
    侵朝美英军俘虏一部举行拥护和平大会
    致书联合国谴责美英帝国主义侵朝罪行
    抗议非法通过污蔑我国为“侵略者”的决议
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】在朝鲜北部某地的美、英侵略军俘虏官兵一部二百七十九人，经过中国人民志愿军短期教育之后，已经开始认识了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的罪恶，并表示愿为争取世界持久和平而努力。他们于二月十一日自动举行了拥护和平大会，并通过致联合国的呼吁书。呼吁书谴责美英帝国主义在朝鲜所造成的灾难，并抗议联合国非法通过污蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的决议案。
    这些原来隶属于美国侵略军陆战第一师、步兵第七师、第三师和英国自豪海军陆战队第四一独立突击队的官兵们，在朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军对待俘虏的宽大政策的感化之下，很快觉悟到他们过去是受了美、英战争贩子的愚弄，对他们自己参加了这种血腥罪行感到羞愧。在一次晚会上，前美步兵第七师三十一团一营上士欧森沉痛地说：“我们手上都沾着无辜人民的鲜血。我们应该如何报答中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民对我们的宽大？我们永不能偿还他们所遭受的惨痛损失，但我们还能尽自己的力量多少做些补偿的事：首先我们应当努力学习真理，第二我们可以写一封和平呼吁书，要求联合国接受中华人民共和国政府所提出的和平调处朝鲜问题的各项建议，这是远东和平的唯一道路。”他的提议很快得到全体俘虏的响应。前美军陆战第一师第一坦克营后勤连下士驾驶员马菲奥利说：“为了和平，为了自己的幸福，我们必须参加和平的呼吁。”随后，他们学习了第二届世界和平大会的《告全世界人民的宣言》和斯德哥尔摩和平呼吁书，一致要求举行拥护和平大会。他们民主选举了一个筹备委员会，积极进行筹备。
    二月十一日，拥护和平大会举行了。大会由前美第十兵团六十九化学烟幕连二等兵汉蒙德主持。前美十兵团少校联络官麦克劳林在会上讲话。他首先问道：“有几个人能真正知道我们被送到朝鲜来的真正理由？”全场高喊道：“没有一个人知道！”接着他叙述了自己被俘以后的思想变化过程。他说“中国人民志愿军已经用真理教育了我们：美国所酝酿的第三次世界大战在日益威胁着人类。我们应该有所行动。”英籍士兵康德伦说：“和平签名仅是我们的第一步行动。”接着有许多人热烈发言。他们对战争贩子们把他们送到朝鲜来进行侵略战争，极为愤怒，并表示愿为争取世界持久和平而努力。最后，全体到会俘虏二百七十九人一致通过致联合国呼吁书，并在上面签了名。志愿军工作人员在最后讲话中除勉励他们的进步外，并希望他们从现在起继续努力为和平事业而奋斗。志愿军代表讲话毕，俘虏们全场起立欢呼。
