The declarations adopted by the First World Peace Council regarding the conclusion of a peace pact, the United Nations, the peaceful resolution of the German question, the peaceful resolution of the Japanese question, the unjust decision passed by the United Nations condemning the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in Korea, and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, propose the only correct solutions to the international conflicts and crises currently caused by the aggression and provocations of the imperialist camp. We firmly support these resolutions and believe that efforts should be made to widely publicize them among the people nationwide and mobilize all forces to achieve their realization.

The Chinese people have always supported world peace and opposed world war. The Chinese people resolutely advocate the conclusion of a five-power peace pact among China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, and the peaceful resolution of the German, Japanese, and Korean questions. However, the American aggressors and their accomplices not only refuse to peacefully resolve the Korean question, but also actively prepare to rearm Germany and Japan, and forcibly pass the shameless decision in the United Nations so-called condemning our country as an "aggressor" in Korea. These facts prove that they are the greatest enemies of peace in the Far East and world peace. The American aggressors and their accomplices are now continuing their ferocious aggression against Korea and continuing to arrogantly occupy our country's Taiwan. On the Korean front, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting heroically against the American aggressors and their accomplices, and have achieved great victories. The Chinese and Korean people have inflicted serious blows and setbacks on the enemy, and will certainly lead to their complete and final defeat. However, in any case, to completely eliminate this group of imperialist bandits who invaded Korea and completely liberate Korea, it will undoubtedly be necessary to go through a considerably long period of resolute, courageous, and resourceful combat. Therefore, our compatriots nationwide must continue to persist in the sacred struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country; strive to popularize and deepen the practical work and propaganda and education work of resisting America, aid Korea, so that every place and every person in the country is educated patriotically and can actively participate in this patriotic action. Only with the victory of resisting America, aid Korea, can we, together with the people of the world, stop the imperialist war plans, strive for the realization of the five-power peace pact, and defend world peace. Therefore, intensifying the resist America, aid Korea movement is the most important way for the Chinese people to support the various resolutions of the World Peace Council.

In order to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement nationwide, and to publicize and respond to the call of the World Peace Council, we suggest the following to all people's organizations and compatriots across the country:

(1) All trade unions, farmers' associations, the New Democratic Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Democratic Women's Federation, student unions, federations of industry and commerce, religious organizations, and other people's organizations should, within the next month, formulate plans for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement within their respective scopes this year, and begin to implement them. Such plans should focus on popularization before May 1st this year and on deepening after May 1st. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, it is necessary to link it to responding to the World Peace Council's resolutions, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and defending world peace, and at the same time, it should be linked to the specific tasks of various localities.

(2) People's representative conferences at all levels throughout the country should, at their next meeting, refer to the above principles, discuss and approve plans for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement within their respective scopes this year.

(3) In late April, people in urban and rural areas across the country should convene small-scale meetings as universally as possible. At these meetings, they should denounce the crimes of Japanese and American aggression and the crimes of Japanese and American running dogs and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents persecuting the people, hold signature campaigns in support of the conclusion of a peace pact, and hold voting on the Japanese question. Masses who have not signed patriotic pacts can use such meetings to sign patriotic pacts. In short, such meetings should be used to mobilize all compatriots from all walks of life across the country to unite as one, intensify the practical work of resisting America, aiding Korea, eliminate all remaining imperialist influences in China, eliminate all remaining American Chiang secret agents and bandits, promote patriotic enthusiasm, work hard in production, work hard, study hard, support the Korean front, stop the war of aggression, and defend world peace.

(4) On May 1st, people in urban and rural areas across the country should hold large-scale demonstrations as universally as possible, with resisting America, aiding Korea, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and defending world peace as the main content of the demonstrations, to further promote the Resist America, Aid Korea movement among the people across the country.

(5) All propaganda, education, and cultural institutions across the country, including schools, night schools, cultural centers, libraries, literacy groups, newspaper reading groups, newspapers, radio stations, pictorial magazines, publishing houses, bookstores, literary groups, music groups, art groups, drama and ballad singing groups, literary and art work troupes, film studios, film and slideshow projection teams, cinemas, theaters, amusement parks, etc., as well as all public places across the country, including factories, shops, markets, hotels, stations, trains, transportation hubs, parks, scenic spots, temple fairs, etc., should formulate propaganda work plans for this year to meet the needs of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and defending world peace movement.

　　中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    为响应世界和平理事会决议并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告
    第一届世界和平理事会所通过的关于缔结和平公约的宣言，关于联合国、关于以和平方式解决德国问题、关于以和平方式解决日本问题、关于联合国通过谴责中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的不公正的决定、关于和平解决朝鲜问题等项决议，对于目前由帝国主义阵营的侵略挑衅所造成的国际间的冲突和危机，提出了唯一正当的解决方案。我们坚决拥护这些决议，并认为应当努力把这些决议在全国人民中广为宣传，并动员一切力量争取其实现。
    中国人民从来是拥护世界和平而反对世界战争的。中国人民坚决主张缔结中、苏、美、英、法五国和平公约，和平解决德国问题、日本问题和朝鲜问题。但是美国侵略者及其帮凶们不但拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，而且积极准备重新武装德国和日本，并且强制联合国通过这所谓谴责我国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的无耻决定。这些事实，证明他们是远东和平和世界和平的最大敌人。美国侵略者及其帮凶们现在正在继续凶恶地侵略朝鲜，继续蛮横地侵占我国的台湾。在朝鲜前线，我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，正在继续向美国侵略者及其帮凶们进行英勇的战斗，并且已经得到伟大的胜利。中朝人民已经使敌人受到严重的打击和挫败，并必将使敌人最后完全失败。但是无论如何，要彻底消灭这一伙侵略朝鲜的帝国主义强盗，全部解放朝鲜，当然还必须经过一个相当长时期的坚决、勇敢和机智的作战。因此，我全国同胞必须继续坚持抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争；努力普及和深入抗美援朝的实际工作和宣传教育工作，务使全国每一处每一人都受到这个爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国行动。只有抗美援朝的胜利，我们才能和世界人民在一起，制止帝国主义的战争计划，争取五国和平公约的实现，保卫世界和平。所以加紧抗美援朝，就是中国人民拥护世界和平理事会各项决议的最重要方法。
    为了在全国普及和深入抗美援朝运动，宣传并响应世界和平理事会的号召，我们向全国各人民团体和全国同胞建议如下：
    （一）全国各工会、农民协会、新民主主义青年团、民主青年联合会、民主妇女联合会、学生联合会、工商界联合会、宗教团体及其他人民团体，均在最近一个月内分别就所属范围制订在今年内普及和深入抗美援朝运动的计划，并着手执行起来。这种计划在今年五一节以前应着重于普及，在五一节以后应着重于深入。在抗美援朝运动中，应当联系到响应世界和平理事会决议，反对武装日本，保卫世界和平，同时应当联系到各地当前的具体任务。
    （二）全国各级人民代表会议，均在最近一次会议中，参照上项原则，讨论和通过所属范围在今年内普及和深入抗美援朝运动的计划。
    （三）在四月下旬，全国城乡人民尽可能普遍召集小型的会议，在这些会议上应当控诉日美侵略的罪行以及日美走狗蒋匪特务迫害人民的罪行，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名，举行日本问题的投票。没有签订过爱国公约的群众，可以利用这样的会议签订爱国公约。总之，应当经过这样的会议动员全国各阶层全体同胞万众一心，加紧抗美援朝的实际工作，肃清帝国主义在华一切残余影响，肃清一切残余的美蒋特务匪徒，大家发扬爱国热情，努力生产，努力工作，努力学习，支援朝鲜前线，制止侵略战争，保卫世界和平。
    （四）在五月一日，全国城乡人民尽可能普遍举行大示威，以抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平为示威的主要内容，推动全国人民抗美援朝运动更进一步。
    （五）全国各宣传教育文化机构，包括学校、夜校、文化馆、图书馆、识字组、读报组、报社、广播台、画报社、出版社、书店、文学团体、音乐团体、美术团体、戏剧曲艺团体、文艺工作团、电影厂、电影幻灯放映队、电影院、剧院、游艺场等，以及全国各公共场所，包括工厂、商店、市集、旅馆、车站、列车、交通要道、公园、名胜区、庙会等，均制订今年内的宣传工作计划，来配合普及和深入抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平运动的需要。

        （简称中国人民抗美援朝总会）
              一九五一年三月十四日
