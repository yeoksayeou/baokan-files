　　The Troops Cheered with "Long Live!"
    (Our reporter Li Zhuang)
    Among the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea, there emerged a troop that was cheered with "Long Live!" This troop defended staunchly and attacked fiercely. Over the past few months, they have established immortal feats for the Chinese and Korean people, winning praise from the entire army.
    It should be said that every unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army deserves to be cheered with "Long Live!" We are fighting against enemies armed to the teeth with almost entirely light weapons. We must overcome all kinds of difficulties far beyond what ordinary people can endure. We live day and night in the snow-covered mountains, hungry, sometimes only tightening our belts; thirsty, eating a few handfuls of accumulated snow; cold, running around with rocks in our arms if the environment permits. We have achieved amazing victories in various harsh environments, and we have defeated the most ferocious enemies of the people of the world.
    What is written here is only one of the many excellent volunteer units.
    The soldiers of the Volunteer Army come from all regions of the motherland. Many of them were still reclaiming wasteland in the vast fields of the motherland last spring, their sweat flowing into the black fertile soil. In summer, they planted rice seedlings in the warm paddy fields. In autumn, as the harvest days approached, the Americans suddenly attacked the Yalu River. They bid farewell to the crops they had cultivated with their own hands and joined the People's Volunteer Army. Everyone knew why they were fighting in Korea. I was chatting with a squad of the Volunteer Army somewhere on the Han River front. The soldiers talked and laughed freely. Finally, the topic naturally focused on one point: boasting about the beautiful rivers and mountains of our great motherland. A Sichuan soldier hoped that after the war, everyone would visit his hometown. "We Sichuan," he said, "has everything. Known as the Land of Abundance, it is truly a top-notch place." A Yunnan soldier said: "Our Yunnan is different from this (referring to winter) Korea. It is spring all year round. It is easy to do anything." A soldier from the Northeast said: "What is cold! We have inexhaustible coal there. There is wood everywhere on the mountains. You are guaranteed not to freeze." Soldiers from the Taihang Mountains missed their persimmons, and soldiers from Shandong praised the silkworms that "reel an ounce of silk from twenty cocoons"... Thinking of our great motherland and looking at the land of Korea ravaged by the U.S. military, everyone sang from the bottom of their hearts the glorious and sacred task: "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation."
    Everyone knows that the Warsaw market is watching us, the American mothers are watching us, the revolutionaries in Vietnam and Malaya are watching us, and the whole world is watching us. Everyone knows their sacred and glorious mission to fight for world peace.

    　　　　Such a Battle
    In late November of last year, this troop that was cheered with "Long Live!" dispatched a capable detachment to penetrate the enemy's depth and block the retreating enemy from Xinxingdong. That was the beginning of the second annihilation battle in northern Korea.
    The troops marched rapidly through the snow-covered mountains where no one lived. When their shoes broke, they wrapped their feet with blankets. When the blankets broke, they walked barefoot. The blood of the Chinese People's Volunteers sprinkled the white snow of Korea, drop by drop. The U.S. military's 2nd, 24th, and 25th Divisions departed from Xinxingdong and fled south in cars. Our Volunteer Army unit followed from Xinxingdong, climbing mountains and chasing south on foot. They chased to the vicinity of Shutang Station (southwest of Gunuri), already bypassing the enemy and setting up a net.
    The 3rd Company of this unit occupied a position on a half-stone, half-earth hill beside the highway. The enemy's motorcade came hastily like a giant python. They would never have thought that a powerful enemy was ambushing them behind their own lines. When the cars reached a few dozen meters in front of the 3rd Company's position, machine gunner Yang Wenming aimed at the first car and fired fiercely. The 5th and 6th Squads quickly rushed into the enemy's formation, throwing grenades fiercely at the groups of cars. Dozens of cars simultaneously spewed thick black and red smoke, and the enemies on the cars scattered and fled. The motorcade was paralyzed on the narrow highway.
    After a period of chaos, the enemy began to realize that their retreat had been cut off, and if they did not break through this barrier, they would be in danger of complete annihilation. The enemy then counterattacked desperately. The 3rd Company launched a heroic blocking battle.
    The enemy's first counterattack was carried out under the cover of aircraft and mortars, but it was quickly repelled by the 3rd Company.
    At this time, eight Mosquito aircraft came from the air, and seven or eight tanks and dozens of howitzers came from the ground. Bombs and shells were poured onto the 3rd Company's position all at once. The soldiers silently guarded their fortifications, covering their machine guns with blankets and their rifles with their bodies, resisting the dust like smoke that flew everywhere. Shrapnel hit the forehead of the 7th Squad Leader Pan Zhizhong, and blood flowed down his cheeks, freezing into ice as it flowed. Pan Zhizhong declined the advice of his comrades and simply said, "A Communist Party member cannot go down," and continued firing.
    The 3rd Company's casualties continued to increase. Instructor Yang Shaocheng and Deputy Company Commander Yang Wanhai accurately assessed the situation and went to every most dangerous place in time, instructing and encouraging everyone to persevere and persevere again. The soldiers always calmly said: "Leaders, don't worry, as long as I am here, the position will be here."
    After the artillery bombardment, more than 300 enemies besieged them from three sides. The soldiers, who had endured a long period of concentrated bombardment, were all gritting their teeth. Now, they saw the enemy's infantry. The soldiers waited for the enemy to advance to 30 to 40 meters in front of the position, concentrated all their firepower, and carried out a surprise attack. The smoke of grenades rose into a black cloud, and machine gun bullets were as dense as a string of pearls. Most of the enemies began to flee in defeat, and several recklessly broke into the 2nd Squad's position. Deputy Squad Leader Sui Jinsheng met them with a bayonet, and the enemies ran away with their heads in their hands. The fourth counterattack was also crushed. More than 300 American corpses were piled up in front of the 3rd Company's position. The 3rd Company's commander, deputy commander, and instructor gloriously sacrificed in this battle, and only more than 20 comrades remained in the entire company.
    The fifth counterattack was the most ferocious. They had been fighting for four hours, and the enemies understood the importance of time to them. Now, they concentrated 32 aircraft, 18 tanks, and dozens of howitzers to bombard this small hill at the same time. Within 20 minutes, 300 to 400 shells landed on the position. Enemy aircraft dropped a large number of "Napalm" (gasoline bombs), and even the moss-covered rocks were scorched. The position became a veritable sea of ​​fire. The soldiers firmly remembered the heroic words they said to the instructor before his sacrifice—"As long as I am here, the position will be here!"—and continued to hold on. Only the wounded 7th Squad Leader Pan Zhizhong and soldier Zhang Xuerong remained on the 3rd Platoon's position. They encouraged each other while shooting: "In order to defend the motherland, we will never retreat a step." "Napalm" landed on the heavy machine gun of the 1st Platoon's position. The clothes of gunner Li Chunfa were completely burned, his face was blistered, and he could not even open his eyes, but he still insisted on shooting.
    After the artillery bombardment, a battalion of enemies charged from three sides. Only six people remained in the 2nd Platoon. They had already run out of grenades, and only a little ammunition remained; but the enemies were coming up. Xiong Guangquan fired the last burst of machine gun bullets, and Li Yu'an fired the last row of submachine gun bullets. The two men picked up their guns without bullets and rushed into the enemy ranks. The six comrades wrestled and fought with the enemies, killing and wounding dozens of them, and finally all gloriously sacrificed.
    The entire position was filled with shouts of killing that frightened the enemies, and a chaotic life-and-death struggle unfolded. The enemies continued to reinforce, trying to drown the 3rd Company's position. The soldiers used their gun butts to hit, stones to smash, feet to kick, mouths to bite, and used every method to defend their position.
    From 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM, six uninjured people remained in the 3rd Company. The enemy deaths exceeded 600. The ratio of enemy to our losses was about six to one. The 3rd Company successfully completed its glorious mission. At this time, friendly forces had converged from all directions, trapping the enemy in a pocket of death.

  Such a Soldier
    In this troop cheered with "Long Live!", there was a young soldier named Guo Qingyun, nicknamed Erhu (Second Tiger). Only during roll call did the platoon leader call "Guo Qingyun." Usually people called him "Erhu, Erhu," very affectionately.
    Guo Qingyun is 22 years old this year, a liberated peasant from Xinmin County, Northeast China. He has big eyes, red cheeks, and is never idle all day, full of energy. At first glance, he is a tiger-like young man, but he is both rough and meticulous when fighting. He likes to say: "We are the assault team." "After crossing the Qingchuan River, we are the assault team, three times in a row as the assault team." The best assault troops are often excellent grenade throwers, and excellent grenade throwers must have fearless spirit and extraordinary perseverance. Guo Qingyun possesses these virtues of the Volunteer Army soldiers. It is not accidental that he has made great contributions on the Korean battlefield.
    When crossing the Qingchuan River, Guo Qingyun's company received the task of penetrating the enemy's lines. At this time, "the enemy had already been beaten into a mess by us, there were enemies everywhere, and we were everywhere. It was more lively than anything else." Guo Qingyun said: "We took off our cotton pants to cross the Qingchuan River. The water was ice-cold. The enemy was shooting, but we didn't care. After crossing the river, I took a grenade and rushed into the enemy ranks. I wasn't wearing cotton pants yet - who could care about wearing cotton pants at this time? Our grenades were thrown where there were many people. The enemy was scared by us. After fighting for a full hour, the battle ended. We put the prisoners in a pile before we put on our cotton pants. Our company captured a total of 135 prisoners."
    In Sansuoli, Guo Qingyun's company was ordered to touch the enemy's artillery. He carried an automatic rifle, with four grenades slung across his shoulder, and walked in front with the deputy squad leader. The sky was pitch black. The two men drilled into the highway from Dechuan to Jiachuan along a small ditch full of shrubs. There were enemies everywhere. In this emergency situation, Guo Qingyun comforted himself: "We are walking in the middle of the enemy. We are surrounded by enemies, and the enemies are surrounded by our people. The enemy may be able to hold up the two of us, but our people will definitely hold up all the enemies." The more he thought about it, the braver he became, and he kept inserting into the top of the highway. There were twenty or so enemies gathered around a fire, still talking and laughing. Guo Qingyun quietly approached the fire and threw two grenades in a row. Several enemies fell to the ground, and the rest scattered and fled. Guo Qingyun and the deputy squad leader took advantage of the situation to chase after them. Before they had taken a few steps, a bullet hit the deputy squad leader's head. In the midst of the panic, the enemy's motorcade came from north to south. Obviously, it was an extremely unfair battle for one person to deal with a motorcade.
    He quietly crawled beside the highway. When the enemy's cars came close, he threw a grenade at the first car, and the car immediately caught fire. The second car could not be closed in time and followed up close. Guo Qingyun threw out the last grenade, and the car was also burned. The enemy was confused about how many people were here, and suddenly became a mess. Guo Qingyun's comrades arrived at this time. Everyone hurriedly eliminated this cowardly enemy and captured more than 20 brand-new cars.
    In Wadong, Guo Qingyun's company was divided into three arrows to touch the artillery on the highway. From the residence to the highway, you had to slide down a winding hillside. Guo Qingyun's assault platoon was quickly discovered by the enemy. The enemy used the anti-aircraft machine gun on the tractor to block all the passages, and the star shells released various rainbow-colored rays. Guo Qingyun cleverly rushed through the enemy's fierce fire net and drilled into a small ditch a dozen meters away from the highway. There were many heavy tractors parked on the highway, dragging heavy howitzers behind them. Guo Qingyun aimed at the wind shield of a tractor and threw a grenade. The glass shattered, the fuel tank caught fire, and the tractor spewed out intense flames. This method was very effective. Guo Qingyun immediately tested it in the same way and burned the second one. He reached into his bag again, but the grenades were gone. Guo Qingyun liked to use grenades the most. "This guy pulls with his left hand and throws with his right hand, and a large area is blown up at once." He said: "This is much better than shooting, shooting at night also exposes the target!" Now, however, he had to use a gun. He took off his American automatic rifle from his shoulder and used a star shell to shoot at the third tractor. Eight bullets set the tractor on fire. When crossing the Qingchuan River, he was still very unfamiliar with this new toy. Before long, he had mastered it skillfully and could "use American guns to fight Americans" with ease.
    Guo Qingyun fought on his own for a while, and his comrades had already rushed from all directions, eliminating this group of Americans and capturing 15 heavy howitzers.
    Guo Qingyun - this cheerful, fearless and carefree young man is bravely fighting on the Han River front. He is not satisfied with a single great contribution. When he joined the People's Volunteer Army and entered Korea, he was determined to make several more contributions. While fighting in Korea, Guo Qingyun never forgot his beloved motherland. He said to the reporter: "Comrade, you see, if the Korean War were to be fought in China, it must start from the Northeast. That crime would be too bad." Therefore, Guo Qingyun does not allow the Americans to invade our country. He said: "We will work hard to fight. We will definitely defeat the Americans. Our China, our Northeast, my Xinmin County, must be safe."

　　被人们欢呼“万岁”的部队
    （本报记者李庄）
    在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军中，出现了一支被人们欢呼“万岁”的部队。这支部队守得硬，打得猛，几个月来，替中朝人民树立了不朽的战功，获得全军的赞誉。
    应该说，中国人民志愿军的每个部队，都是应该被人们欢呼“万岁”的。我们几乎完全以轻武器和武装到牙齿的敌人作战。我们必须克服各种各样远非平常人所能忍受的困难。我们日夜生活在白雪皑皑的深山中，饿了，有时候只能紧紧腰带；渴了，吃几把积雪；冷了，如果环境许可，抱着石头跑步。我们是在各种艰苦环境中得到惊人的胜利，我们打败了世界人民的最凶狠的敌人。
    这里所写的，只是许多优秀的志愿部队中间的一个。
    志愿军的战士们来自祖国的各个地区。他们之中的很多人，去年春天，还在广阔的祖国原野上垦荒，汗水流进了黑色的沃土。夏天，在微温的水田中插上稻秧。秋天，收获的日子近了，美国人忽然打到鸭绿江边。他们辞别亲手培植的庄稼，参加了人民志愿部队，他们每个人都知道自己为什么到朝鲜来作战。我在汉江前线某地，曾和志愿军某部一个班闲谈。战士们海阔天空，纵谈情笑。最后，话题十分自然地集中到一点：夸耀我们伟大祖国的美丽河山。一个四川战士希望战争结束以后，大家都到他的故乡看看。“我们四川，”他说：“啥子都有。人称天府之国，真是个顶好的地方。”一个云南战士说：“我们云南和这个（指冬天）朝鲜不一样，一年四季都是春天。作什么都便易。”东北一个战士说：“冷算个什么！我们那里煤炭用不完。山上到处是木头。保险冻不着你。”太行山的战士怀念自己的柿子，山东的战士夸奖“二十个茧缫一两丝”的山蚕……。想想自己伟大的祖国，看看朝鲜被美军蹂躏的土地，每一个人都从心里歌颂自己光荣神圣的任务：“抗美援朝，保家卫国。”
    每一个人都知道华沙的市场上看着我们，美国的母亲们看着我们，越南、马来亚的革命者看着我们，全世界都看着我们。每一个人都知道自己为世界和平而战的神圣光荣任务。
    　　　　这样的战斗
    去年十一月下旬，这支被人们欢呼“万岁”的部队，派遣了一支精干的小部队，插入敌人的纵深，堵击从新兴洞后退的敌人。那正是朝北第二次歼灭战的开始。
    部队在没有人迹的高山峻岭中，雪夜急行军。鞋子破了，用一块毯子包着脚走。毯子破了，赤着脚走。中国人民志愿军脚上的鲜血，点点滴滴地洒在朝鲜洁白的雪地上。美军第二师、二十四师、二十五师的部队，从新兴洞出发，坐着汽车向南跑。我们这支志愿军部队跟着从新兴洞出发，徒步爬山向南追。追到书堂站（军隅里西南）附近，早已绕到敌人前面，布置了一个天罗地网。
    该部三连在公路旁一个半石半土的山岗上占领了阵地。敌人的汽车纵队像一条巨蟒，匆匆而来。他们决不会想到，在他们自己的战线后面，竟然埋伏了一支劲敌。汽车进到三连阵地前沿几十米处，机枪手杨文明对准第一辆猛烈射击。五、六班迅速冲入敌阵，向成群的汽车猛掷手榴弹。几十辆汽车同时喷出黑中透红的浓烟，车上的敌人四散滚逃，汽车队瘫痪在窄狭的公路上。
    一阵混乱之后，敌人开始明白他们的退路已被切断，不冲过这一关，就有全军覆没的危险。敌人于是拚死反扑。三连就展开了一场壮烈的阻击战。
    敌人第一次反扑是在飞机和迫击炮掩护下进行的，很快就被三连打退了。
    这时，空中来了八架蚊式机，地上开来七、八辆坦克，榴弹炮摆开几十门。炸弹和炮弹一齐倾泄到三连的阵地上。战士们不声不响地守在工事里，用毯子盖住机枪，用身子掩住步枪，抵御纷纷乱飞的烟幕一样的尘土。弹片打在七班长潘治中的额头上，鲜血沿着脸颊流下来，流着流着冻成了冰。潘治中谢绝了战友们的劝告，简单地说了一句“共产党员，不能下去”，继续射击。
    三连的伤亡不断增加。指导员杨绍成，副连长杨万海看准火候，及时跑到每一个最危急的地方去，指示，鼓动，要大家坚持，再坚持。战士们总是从容不迫地说：“首长放心，有我，就有阵地。”
    炮击过后，三百多敌人从三面围攻上来。战士们忍受了长时期的集中轰击，都在咬牙切齿。现在，他们看见敌人的步兵了。战士们等敌人进到阵地前沿三、四十米，集中一切火力，实行突然射击，手榴弹的硝烟腾起一片黑色的云雾，机枪弹密如连珠。大部敌人开始溃逃了，有几个冒死闯入二班的阵地。副班长隋金声端着刺刀迎上去，敌人抱头就跑。第四次反扑又被粉碎。三连的阵地前沿，堆起三百多个美国死尸。三连的连长、副连长、指导员都在这次战斗中光荣牺牲，全连还剩下二十多个同志。
    第五次反扑是最凶恶的。已经打了四小时，敌人很懂得时间对于他们的意义。现在，他们集中了三十二架飞机，十八辆坦克，几十门榴弹炮，同时向这个不大的山岗轰击。二十分钟以内，阵地上落了三、四百发炮弹。敌机投下大量“纳巴姆”（汽油弹），长着藓苔的岩石都被烧焦，阵地变成真正的火海。战士们牢牢记着在指导员牺牲以前大家对他说的豪语——“有我，就有阵地！”而继续坚守着。三排阵地上只剩下负了伤的七班长潘治中和战士张学荣，两个人一面射击，一面互相鼓励：“为了保卫祖国，决不后退一步”。“纳巴姆”落在一排阵地的重机枪上，射手李春发的衣服全被烧坏，脸上起了水泡，眼都睁不开了，仍然坚持射击。
    炮击过后，一营敌人从三面平拥冲锋。二排只剩了六个人，手榴弹早已打光，子弹只剩了一点点；而敌人上来了。熊光全打完最后一梭子机枪子弹，李玉安打完最后一排冲锋枪子弹，两个人端起没有子弹的枪支，冲入敌人群中。六个同志和敌人一起摔跤、扭打，杀伤几十个敌人，最后全部光荣牺牲。
    整个阵地上充满使敌人破胆的杀声，展开一场混乱的生死搏斗。敌人不断增援，企图淹没三连的阵地。战士们用枪托打，用石头砸，用脚踢，用嘴咬，用尽一切方法，坚守自己的阵地。
    从上午六时打到中午十二时，三连剩下六个没有负伤的人，敌人死亡六百余，敌我损失约为六与一之比。三连胜利地完成了光荣的任务。这时候，友军已从四面八方合拢，把敌人圈到了死亡的口袋中。
  这样的战士
    在这支被人们欢呼“万岁”的部队中，有一个青年战士，名郭庆云，绰号二虎。只在点名的时候，排长才喊“郭庆云”，平常人们总叫“二虎，二虎”，十分亲热。
    郭庆云今年二十二岁，东北新民县的翻身农民。大眼睛，红脸蛋，成天永不闲着，浑身充满精力。乍一看他是个虎里虎气的青年人，打起仗来却是粗中有细。他喜欢说：“我们是突击组”。“过了清川江就是突击组，一连三回突击组。”最好的突击员往往是优秀的投弹手，优秀的投弹手必须有无畏的精神和超人的毅力。郭庆云具备着这些志愿军战士的美德，他在朝鲜战场上立了大功，实在不是偶然的。
    抢渡清川江时，郭庆云的连队领受了穿插敌人的任务。这时候，“敌人已经被我们打得乱七八糟，到处都有敌人，到处都有我们。真是比什么都热闹。”郭庆云说：“我们脱下棉裤过清川江。水冰凉凉的。敌人打枪，我们不管。过了江，我拿着手榴弹，一下子冲到敌人队伍里。我还没有穿棉裤，——这时候谁顾得上穿棉裤呢？我们的手榴弹净找人多的地方甩。敌人被我们吓蒙了。足足打了一点钟，战斗结束，把俘虏归成一堆，我们才穿棉裤。我们这个连，一共抓住一百三十五个俘虏。”
    在三所里，郭庆云连奉命去摸敌人的大炮。他提着一支自动步枪，挎着四颗手榴弹，和副班长走在前面。天墨黑墨黑，两个人顺着条长满灌木的小沟，钻到德川到价川的公路上。到处都有敌人。遇到这种紧急的情况，郭庆云自己安慰自己：“我们是在敌人中间走咧。我们外面是敌人，敌人外面又是我们的人，敌人也许可以卡住我们两个人，我们的人一定会卡住全部敌人。”越想胆子越壮，一直插到公路上面。有二十几个敌人围在一起烤火，还在说说笑笑呢。郭庆云悄悄走近火堆，接连丢进两个手榴弹。几个敌人倒在地上，其余的四散逃跑。郭庆云和副班长两个人乘势猛追，追了没有几步，一颗子弹恰恰打中副班长的头颅。正在慌乱之间，敌人的汽车队由北南来。一个人对付一个汽车队，显然是个极不公平的战斗。
    他静静地爬在公路旁边。敌人的汽车开到跟前，他向第一辆车投出一颗手榴弹，汽车立时起火。第二辆车一时来不及闭火，跟着冲到跟前。郭庆云投出最后一颗手榴弹，汽车又被烧着。敌人弄不清这里有多少人，顿时乱成一团。郭庆云的战友们恰在这个时候赶到了，大家七手八脚，消灭了这股怯懦的敌人，缴获了二十多部崭新的汽车。
    在瓦洞，郭庆云的连队分成三个箭头，摸到公路上去摸炮。从驻地到公路，要滑下一个迂缓的山坡。郭庆云的突击排，很快被敌人发现了。敌人用牵引车上的高射机枪，封锁了所有的通路，星光弹放出各种虹彩的光芒。郭庆云巧妙地冲过敌人炽盛的火网，钻到距公路十几米的一个小沟里。公路上停着许多重型牵引车，车后拖着重榴弹炮。郭庆云瞄准一辆牵引车的遮风板，甩过一颗手榴弹，玻璃粉碎，油箱燃着，牵引车吐出浓烈的火焰。这个方法很有效果。郭庆云立刻如法试验，又烧着第二辆。他再去袋子里摸，手榴弹完了。郭庆云是最喜欢用手榴弹的，“这家伙左手一拉，右手一甩，一炸一大片。”他说：“这比打枪好得多，夜里打枪还暴露目标呢！”现在，他却不得不用枪了。他从肩上摘下美国自动步枪，用星光弹向第三辆牵引车射击。八发子弹，把牵引车打得烧起熊熊大火。过清川江时，他对于这种新玩艺还很生疏。为时不久，他已经熟练地掌握了它，能得心应手地“用美国枪打美国人”。
    郭庆云自己打了不大一会儿，战友们已从四面赶来，消灭了这批美国人，缴获了十五门重榴弹炮。
    郭庆云——这个愉快的、不怕困难而又无忧无虑的青年人，正在汉江前线上英勇地战斗着。他不以一次大功为满足。当他参加人民志愿军，进入朝鲜时，就决心多立几次功。郭庆云一面在朝鲜作战，一面念念不忘亲爱的祖国。他对记者说：“同志，你看，朝鲜战争如果打到中国去，一定先从东北开始，那个罪就糟大了。”因此，郭庆云是不允许美国人侵略我国的。他说：“我们会努力作战，我们一定能打败美国人。我们中国，我们东北，我的新民县，一定要是安全的。”

    这支被人们欢呼“万岁”的志愿部队，一直从鸭绿江打到汉江，从来没有休息。现在，这支英雄部队正在汉江南岸顽强奋战。他们保卫着汉江，但是眼看着锦江和洛东江。他们将要继续前进，最后的胜利召唤着他们。
              二月三日于汉江前线
