Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 14th: A group of 279 American and British invading soldiers and officers captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers, at a conference supporting peace held on February 11th, passed an appeal to the United Nations, the full text of which is as follows:

To the United Nations:

We, personnel serving in the US, British, and Syngman Rhee puppet armies, are victims of the Korean War. We have personally experienced the terror and devastation of war suffered by the people. We have witnessed with our own eyes the painful expressions in the eyes of the homeless, frightened civilians. When towns were bombed, we saw old people, women, and children being innocently slaughtered. We saw babies crying on the chests of their dead mothers.

We have seen too much of things like this. This pain and misfortune occurred because the US-British bloc manipulated the voting of the United Nations and violated the UN Charter.

The people of Asia have heard, and can still hear, the roar of cannons and the heart-stopping shriek of falling bombs. If this war is not stopped immediately, the whole world will echo with these terrible sounds, and many countries will be completely reduced to ruins.

We have learned a bitter and poignant truth, and we believe that the only way to eliminate the threat of another world war is to use the following documents and policies, which we unanimously endorse and support:

I. The "Declaration to the People of the World" of the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw.

II. Accept the three-point proposal of Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations to immediately stop the Korean War.

The first document mentioned above contains the only way to solve the problem of lasting world peace, and with the participation and cooperation of all nations of the world, this glorious goal can be achieved.

The policies and proposals in the second item above provide the only true answer of peace to the people of Asia, especially to the 475 million Chinese people who have endured hardships and fought for peace for more than a century.

In support of the 600 million peace-loving people around the world who signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, we demand the unconditional abolition of atomic weapons as instruments of mass slaughter, and urge their realization with a strict international control organization.

We demand that the first government to use the atomic bomb be condemned as a war criminal.

We strongly protest the recent illegal UN resolution declaring the People's Republic of China as an aggressor in Korea. Based on our personal contact and experience with the Chinese People's Volunteers, we have become deeply convinced of the righteousness of their actions and have begun to understand that they are true representatives of a peace-loving nation.

With this effort, we join the resolute struggle of the people of the world to achieve lasting world peace.

The signatories to the appeal are Hammond, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Peace Conference, Harrison, Secretary, and committee members Murphy, Estes, McLaughlin, Olsen, Phillips, Weiler, Dana, Roes, and Adams, Barber, Walter, and a total of 279 people.

　　美英俘虏拥护和平大会
    致联合国呼吁书
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】被中国人民志愿军俘虏的美、英侵略军官兵一部二百七十九人，于二月十一日举行拥护和平大会时，通过致联合国呼吁书一份，全文如下：
    “致联合国：
    我们这些在美、英军和李承晚伪军中服务的人员，是朝鲜战争中的牺牲品。我们亲身经历了人民所遭受到的战争的恐怖与摧残。我们亲眼目睹了无家可归的、受惊的平民眼光中所流露的痛苦表情。当城镇被轰炸时，我们看到了老年人、妇女、小孩子被无辜屠杀。我们看到了婴儿们在死去了的母亲的胸前号哭。
    诸如此类的事情，我们都看得多了。这种痛苦与不幸之所以发生，是因为美英集团操纵了联合国的投票，并违反了联合国宪章。
    亚洲人民曾经听到，并且现在还能听到大炮的轰鸣，与炸弹落下时夺人心魄的尖啸声。假使这个战争不能立刻制止，则全世界就将回响起这些可怕的声音，许多国家将要被完全毁为废墟。
    我们已领会到惨痛辛酸的真理，我们相信解除这种另一次世界大战威胁的唯一方法，是用我们所一致拥护和支持的下列文件与政策：
    一、在华沙举行的第二届世界和平大会的《告全世界人民的宣言》。
    二、接受中国外交部周恩来部长致联合国的三点建议，立即停止朝鲜战争。
    上述第一项中的文件中包含有解决世界持久和平问题的唯一方法，而在世界各民族的参与和合作之下，将能达到这一光荣目的。
    上述第二项中的政策与建议，提供了给予亚洲人民、特别是对百多年来历尽艰苦为和平而斗争的四亿七千五百万的中国人民以唯一的真正和平的答案。
    为了支持在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名的全世界六万万爱好和平的人民，我们要求无条件废止作为大规模屠杀的工具的原子武器，并以严格的国际管制组织促其实现。
    我们要求谴责第一个使用原子弹的政府为战争罪犯。
    我们坚决抗议最近联合国宣布中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的侵略者的非法决议。根据我们亲身和中国人民志愿军的接触与体验，我们业已深信他们行为的正义性，并且业已开始了解他们是一个爱好和平的民族的真正代表者。
    我们以我们的这一份努力，加入到全世界人民为争取世界持久和平所作的坚决的斗争中去。”
    在呼吁书上签名者有拥护和平大会筹委会主席汉蒙德，秘书赫里逊，委员莫菲、埃斯蒂斯、麦克劳林、欧森、菲立浦斯、魏勒、丹纳、罗埃斯，及亚当斯、巴伯、华特等共二百七十九人。
