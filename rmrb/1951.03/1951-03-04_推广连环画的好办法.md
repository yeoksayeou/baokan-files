　　Good Ways to Promote Comic Books
　　Yang Qiushi
　　In order to actively promote good comic books, replace some books containing feudal and superstitious toxins in street comic book stalls, and help develop good comic book stalls, the Taiyuan Municipal Cultural Center and Xinhua Bookstore have jointly carried out a meaningful work in a planned manner.
　　There are seventeen comic book stalls in Taiyuan City, with 1,900 picture books. Many of them have been operating since the period of the Yan puppet regime and still retain most of the comic books containing toxins. On the one hand, the Cultural Center has added children's reading rooms, and on the other hand, it has carried out transformation and education for the stall vendors, correcting their purely profit-making viewpoints and developing the idea of serving the people. At the same time, it helps them to review old books, persuade them to automatically stop reading forty kinds of books containing toxins, and the Cultural Center will lend 400 comic books to the stalls free of charge to reduce their losses, and advise them to purchase a large number of new books. The Cultural Center and Xinhua Bookstore have agreed to give the book stalls a discount on purchases and preferential treatment for payment one month after the purchase. This has greatly helped the development of the book stall industry and united them.
　　Regarding the promotion of comic books in schools, the City Cultural Center and Xinhua Bookstore also took the following steps to conduct preliminary experiments: First, each school was given a certain number of books for rent in the school. The reading fee was uniformly 100 yuan per book, which was 200 to 400 yuan cheaper than the street comic book stalls. Second, when the fee is full to the selling price, the book fee is handed over to Xinhua Bookstore, and the book belongs to the school. Children's reading will no longer be charged, and then a certain number of books will be added.
　　The experiment was successful. In one elementary school, the income in two months was 442,600 yuan, with a total of 4,426 readings. The school has a total of 1,200 children, with an average of 3 to 4 readings per person. This method not only takes care of the school's financial difficulties, but also helps children to read books at a low price, and the bookstore can also use this to promote good books in a planned way.
　　Now seventeen schools have done it in the same way. In addition, private bookstores are entrusted with considerable profits to promote it in fifteen schools.
　　After the successful promotion of new comic books in schools, it has further developed to other areas. Xinhua Bookstore also used the same method to cooperate with the district government to first try it out in a bathroom. The method used is also to borrow books in advance. After the reading fee is paid to clear the book price, the income will be owned by the labor and management of the bathroom. In the one month of the trial, more than 800 people in this bathroom read comic books. After the trial was successful, it was promoted, so in December last year, it increased to five bathrooms to promote comic books.
　　On the other hand, in mid-November last year, the Cultural Center separated a part of its manpower to conduct mobile reading in factories, and completed the reading tasks of three factories in three weeks. Seventy to eighty percent of the two thousand workers have read it, and one of the workers used his rest time to finish reading eighteen books in three days.
　　In order to meet the actual needs and develop the promotion of comic books in the future, Taiyuan Xinhua Bookstore, in addition to continuing to develop on the existing basis, plans to promote it to every household through residents' representatives or private schools and women's literacy classes. The Cultural Center plans to strengthen the work of the reading room in the museum, and set up two cultural stations in the city to circulate book reading and handle lending.

　　推广连环画的好办法
    杨秋实
    为了积极地推广良好的连环画，代替街头小人书摊中部分含有封建迷信毒素的书籍，帮助发展良好的小人书摊，太原市文化馆与新华书店有计划地共同进行了一项有意义的工作。
    太原全市共有小人书摊十七家，拥有画册一千九百本，其中许多都是在阎伪统治时期营业一直继续至今的，他们仍然保留有大部分含有毒素的连环画册。文化馆一方面增设儿童阅览室，一面对书摊商贩进行改造教育，纠正其单纯营利观点，发展为人民服务的思想。同时帮助他们进行审查旧书，说服他们将其中有毒素的四十种自动停止阅览，另由文化馆无偿借给连环画四百册，分配给书摊，减少他们的损失，并劝告他们大量增购新书。文化馆与新华书店商定对书摊进货予以减价和在购书一个月后付价的优待。这样，大大地帮助了书摊业的发展，并团结了他们。
    关于在学校方面推广连环画，该市文化馆与新华书店也采取了如下的步骤，先行试验：一、交给每个学校一定数量的书，在学校中办理出租，每册一律收阅览费一百元，比较街头小人书摊每册便宜二百至四百元。二、收费至满了售价时，书款交给新华书店，书便归学校所有，以后儿童阅览便不再收费；然后再添配一定数量的书。
    这个办法试验结果得到成功了。在一个小学里，两个月中收入四十四万二千六百元，计阅览四千四百二十六次，该校共一千二百个儿童，平均每人阅览三至四次。这种办法，既照顾了学校的经费困难，又帮助了儿童廉价阅书，书店方面也借此可以有计划地推广好书。
    现在已有十七个学校用同一办法作了。另外还委托私营书店，给以相当利润，推行了十五个学校。
    新连环画的推广，在学校中取得成功以后，更进而向其他方面发展。新华书店又用同一办法，配合区政府首先在一个浴室内试办推行。所用的方法也是预借书籍，俟阅览收费至缴清书价后，以后收入即归浴室劳资两方所有。在试办的一个月中，这个浴室内有八百多人看了连环画。试办成功后即加以推广，所以在去年十二月份便增加到有五家浴室作推广连环画的工作。
    另一方面文化馆在去年十一月中分出一部分人力到工厂作巡回阅览，三周内完成三个工厂的阅览任务。两千个工人中的十分之七八都阅览了，其中一个工人利用休息时间在三天中看完了十八册书。
    为了满足实际需要和开展今后推广连环画工作，太原新华书店除继续在现有基础上发展外，并拟通过居民代表或民校、妇女识字班推行到各家各户去。文化馆计划除加强馆内的阅览室工作外，再在市区分设两个文化站巡回图书阅览，办理出借。
