　　Conscientiously Mobilize Social Forces to Do a Good Job in Regular Preferential Treatment
    There are over thirty million family members of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary servicemen, and revolutionary workers nationwide, and over seven hundred thousand disabled revolutionary soldiers (excluding those in active service). The government has the responsibility to allocate a certain amount of resources to solve their difficulties, but relying solely on the government's strength is far from enough. Therefore, the government should promote, guide, and mobilize social forces to jointly carry out this work. Some cadres tend to overlook the power of society, and when faced with difficulties, they are either at a loss or expect higher authorities to solve them. In fact, as long as social forces are mobilized, the difficulties can be appropriately resolved. The achievements of the army support and preferential treatment campaign during the New Year period is a proof; last winter, the national campaign to collect winter clothing for disaster victims completed more than 6.7 million sets, which is also a proof.
    Mobilizing social forces to carry out regular preferential treatment work includes the following contents: (1) Mobilize the people to respect and learn from the spirit of the martyrs. Regular memorial services for martyrs can be held to publicize their heroic deeds, etc. (2) Mobilize the people to love the people's armed forces and care about armed work. Mobilize the people to regularly provide various assistance to the people's army. Wherever troops are stationed, good military-civilian relations should be established. (3) Cherish and care for the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary servicemen, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. In rural areas, the work of substitute farming must be done well, so that it becomes a voluntary act of the masses; in cities, mobilize social forces to solve the employment problems of the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary servicemen, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. Mobilize private industrial and commercial enterprises to provide job opportunities to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen who are familiar to them or have relatives. (4) The preferential treatment committees and preferential treatment groups in various regions must be improved. The upcoming representative conferences of disabled revolutionary soldiers or representative conferences of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen must be made into conferences that the masses care about and that can educate the masses. Attention should be paid to organizing the masses to regularly inspect the preferential treatment work, especially the substitute farming work in rural areas.

　　认真发动社会力量  做好经常的优抚工作
    全国约有革命烈士家属、革命军人家属及革命工作人员家属三千余万人，革命残废军人七十余万人（不包括在职的），政府有责任拿出一定的力量来解决他们的困难，但单靠政府的力量是很不够的，因此，应由政府提倡指导和发动组织社会的力量，共同进行这一工作。某些干部容易忽视社会的力量，一遇到困难，就束手无策，或指望上级解决，其实只要发动起社会的力量，困难便可获得适当解决。新旧年关拥军优属运动的成绩是一个证明；去年冬季全国募集灾民寒衣运动完成六百七十余万套，也是一个证明。
    发动社会力量进行经常的优抚工作，包括下列的内容：（一）发动人民尊敬和学习烈士风气。可定期举行烈士纪念会，宣扬烈士的英勇事迹等。（二）动员人民爱戴人民武装并关心武装工作。动员人民经常给人民军队以各种帮助，凡有军队驻扎的地方，应搞好军民关系。（三）爱护和关心革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人。在农村，代耕工作必须作好，使之成为群众的自愿行为；在城市，发动社会力量来解决革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的就业问题，动员私营工商业给予和他们熟识的或有亲戚关系的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属以工作岗位。（四）各地的优抚委员会及优抚小组，必须使之健全起来，即将召开的各地革命残废军人代表会议或革命烈士家属、革命军人家属代表会议，必须使之成为群众所关心又能教育群众的会议。要注意组织群众经常来检查优抚工作，特别是农村的代耕工作。
