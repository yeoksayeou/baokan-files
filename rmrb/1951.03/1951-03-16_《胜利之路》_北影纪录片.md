    "The Road to Victory"
    Beijing Film Studio Documentary
    Edited by: Wang Shui
    The Railway Corps – They are a part of the People's Liberation Army.
  Just as the revolutionary situation was developing victoriously, our various field armies were pursuing the enemy on a large scale. The counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek, in order to save his fate of death, dreamed of stopping our liberation army from advancing and carried out inhumane and frenzied destruction of the railways and bridges on our marching routes.
  The Railway Corps – In order to guarantee the task given to them by Commander-in-Chief Zhu, they quickly repaired and opened the traffic, so that the people's trains could continuously drive to the front, and the strong resources of the rear could be supplied to the various field armies in time; so that the front and rear could be quickly connected into one; so that the materials of the cities and the countryside could be exchanged.
  Under the political slogan of "Where the front fights, the railway repairs to," the heroic People's Railway Corps is active on the vast land of the motherland. They are still wearing single clothes and bare feet in the weather of minus forty degrees. In the south, they are under the hot sun, but in the north, they are in the icy rivers, regardless of day and night, regardless of ice and snow, and they are carrying out combat-intensive repairs on the advancing railway lines.
  In the repair work – on the one hand, they are fighting against the enemy on the land, and on the other hand, they are fighting back against the strafing and bombing of enemy planes.
  In order to ensure the early completion of the task, they overcame all difficulties and insisted on working under the difficult conditions of enemy planes strafing and bombing and the untimely supply of materials.
  This lofty spirit of self-sacrifice and the heroic spirit of high labor enthusiasm have created amazing and immortal heroic deeds in every task, and countless people's heroes have emerged.
  The American imperialists and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek's ilk of lackeys! Once absurdly said that the Chinese could not build without the United States, and that it would take eight to ten years to rebuild the railways and bridges they had destroyed!
  What are the facts?
  Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's construction thought, the People's Railway Corps repaired the Beining Railway with a selfless work spirit, supporting the Pingjin Campaign.
  The revival of the Jinpu Railway has paved the way for the million-strong army eager to go south.
  The early repair of the three major trunk lines of Longhai, Jinghan, and Yuehan, which run vertically and horizontally through the east, west, north, and south of the motherland, not only accelerated the liberation of the Northwest, Central China, Southeast, and Great Northwest, but also has extremely important significance in prospering the economy.
  The national railway network destroyed by the counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek was completely repaired in only one and a half years, powerfully hitting the mad clamor and shameless rumors of American imperialism and its lackeys. Thirteenth film of the new film exhibition month, showing on March 20th

    铁道兵团——他们是人民解放军的一部分。
  正当革命形势胜利的发展，我各路野战部队，大规模的向敌人长驱追击。反革命的蒋介石为了挽救他的死亡命运，梦想阻止我解放大军前进，把我们进军道路上的铁路、桥梁，进行了无人性的、疯狂的破坏。
  铁道兵团——他们为了保证朱总司令所给予他们的任务，迅速抢修通车，使人民的列车，源源的开往前方，把后方的雄厚资源及时供应各路野战大军；使前后方，迅速连成一片；使城市与城市，城市与乡村的物资，得以交流。
  在“前方打到那里，铁路抢修到那里”的政治口号下，英勇的人民铁道兵团，活跃在祖国的辽阔大地上。他们在零下四十度的天气里，还穿着单衣，赤着足。在南方正处在炎热的太阳下，在北方却在结了冰的河川里，不问白天黑夜，不顾冰雪寒霜，在进军的铁路线上，进行战斗紧张的抢修。
  在抢修中——一面对着陆地上的敌人，进行战斗，一面还要反击敌机的扫射轰炸。
  为了保证任务的提前完成，在敌机扫射轰炸和材料不能及时供应的困难条件下，他们克服了一切困难，坚持着工作。
  他们这种崇高的自我牺牲精神，发挥高度的劳动热忱的英雄气概，在每一个任务中，都创造了惊人不朽的英雄事迹，涌现出无数的人民英雄。
  美帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石之流的奴才们！曾荒谬的说中国人没有美国，就无法建设，要想把他们破毁的铁路、桥梁重新建设起来，非得八年到十年不可！
  事实怎么样呢？
  人民的铁道兵团，在毛主席的建设思想指导下，以忘我的工作精神，修复了北宁路，支援了平津战役。
  津浦路的复活，又为急待南下的百万雄师，铺平了大道。
  纵横贯串祖国东西南北的陇海、京汉、粤汉三大干线的提前修复，不只加速了西北与华中、东南、大西北的解放，而且在繁荣经济上，也有着极其重要的意义。
  被反革命蒋介石破毁的全国铁路网，仅用一年半的时间全部修复，有力的打击了美帝国主义和他的奴才们的疯狂叫嚣和无耻造谣。新片展览月第十三部三月二十日上映
