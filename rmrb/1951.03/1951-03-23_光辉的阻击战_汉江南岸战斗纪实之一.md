　　Glorious Blocking Action
    ——A Record of the Battle on the South Bank of the Han River, Part 1
    By Our Correspondent Li Zhuang
    From January 25th to February 11th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army conducted an eighteen-day and night blocking action on the south bank of the Han River. More than 10,000 American aggressor troops were annihilated on this front. The Volunteer Army and the People's Army, with a small force, resisted enemy forces with absolute superiority in personnel and equipment. The enemy advanced at an average rate of less than one and a half kilometers per day, suffering heavy casualties. This blocking action created important conditions for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army's eastern offensive on February 11th, which annihilated more than 12,000 enemy troops and liberated Hengcheng.
    The enemy's attempt to invade the Han River this time was very arrogant. MacArthur attempted to cross the Han River in one fell swoop, reoccupy Seoul, and once again burn the flames of aggressive war north of the "38th Parallel," in order to restore MacArthur's increasingly bankrupt prestige and increase the confidence of the mutually cursing aggressive bloc. In the battle to liberate Seoul in early January, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army launched an offensive against the enemy on a 500-li wide front. Several hours later, they broke through the enemy's permanently fortified "38th Parallel," routed a large number of enemy troops, and liberated Seoul in one fell swoop. The enemy retreated hundreds of miles from the "38th Parallel" to the south of Suwon, fleeing from Line A to Line D. (At that time, the enemy had built several lines of defense, with the original "38th Parallel" as Line A, the Uijeongbu to Taechon line as Line B, the Han River as Line C, and the area south of Suwon as Line D.) At that time, the imperialist aggressor group was in an uproar, with London, Paris, Angola... all cursing Washington, and MacArthur being called a "fool" and a "madman." Therefore, MacArthur launched this new offensive before he had even caught his breath.
    In this risky offensive, MacArthur used more than 90% of his forces in Korea, a total of about 230,000 men. MacArthur's main force in Korea consisted of seven American divisions. Except for the so-called "Ace" 1st Marine Division, which had suffered heavy losses in the Changjin Lake area and whose combat effectiveness had not yet recovered, the remaining six American divisions, namely the 1st Cavalry Division, the 2nd Division, the 3rd Division, the 7th Division, the 24th Division, and the 25th Division, all advanced to the front line in this offensive. In addition, MacArthur also used two British brigades, ten Syngman Rhee divisions, a battered Turkish brigade, and aggressor troops from the Netherlands, France, the Philippines, Greece, and other countries. This time, the vanguard was not the puppet army but the American army.
    Having suffered three defeats in a row, MacArthur adopted a steady and simultaneous advance tactic in this offensive. He focused his offensive on the western front, that is, on the 80-kilometer front between Suwon and Yeoju. On this line, his main offensive prongs were two: one starting from Suwon, attacking Seoul along the railway, and the other starting from Icheon and Yeoju, attacking Gyeongan-ri south of the Han River along two highways. For these two routes, he used four American divisions, two British brigades, two Rhee puppet divisions, a Turkish brigade, and auxiliary troops from Greece, the Philippines, and other countries. In the Wonju area east of Yeoju, MacArthur used more than six divisions; on the east coast, MacArthur used about four divisions, echoing the enemy on the western front.
    In order to "quickly cross the Han River," MacArthur poured a large amount of steel and equipment into the south bank of the Han River. The Volunteer Army soldiers said: "He used everything except the atomic bomb. But what's the use of the atomic bomb?" Indeed, the enemy used all kinds of "new weapons." It dropped one-ton bombs on the Volunteer Army's earth and wood field fortifications, dropped cluster bombs tied with parachutes on Volunteer Army combat groups of two or three soldiers, it used napalm (jellied gasoline bombs) to scorch the grass and moss-covered rocks on the mountains, and its artillery turned the mountain positions defended by the Volunteer Army into honeycombs. However, the imperialism's steel could crush the rocks on the mountains, but it could not frustrate the invincible will of the Volunteer Army and People's Army soldiers. In the eighteen-day and night blocking action, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought bravely against the enemy entirely with light weapons, and effectively defeated MacArthur's war machine.
    The terrain on the south bank of the Han River was not conducive to defense. The Volunteer Army and the People's Army were fighting with their backs to the water, holding a bridgehead position with a depth of only sixty or seventy li. At that time, the frozen Han River had begun to thaw, with solid ice still lining the banks on the 500-meter-wide river surface and floating ice floes in the middle of the river. The two large bridges over the Han River had long been destroyed by the American army, and the temporary pontoon bridges built by our army on the ice had been submerged by the spring floods. From Seoul to Suwon, the southern part is a winding and undulating hill, and the northern part is the Han River plain, which is very favorable for the enemy's tank operations. From Icheon and Yeoju to the Gyeongan-ri line, most of the mountain gullies run from south to north, which also facilitates the entry and exit of enemy tanks and heavy artillery. The cliffs on the south bank of the Han River here also increased the difficulty of our army's transportation and supply. The Han River divides into north and south sources east of Gyeongan-ri, with the South Han River coming from the southeast and the North Han River coming from the northeast. Hengcheng, between the North and South Han Rivers, was now occupied by the enemy, so the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army south of the Han River were operating deep behind enemy lines.
    The mission of the small number of Volunteer Army and People's Army troops on the south bank of the Han River was arduous. But they gloriously completed the arduous task.
    Day and night, the battle on the south bank of the Han River was earth-shattering. The fields and mountains on both sides of the Han River were shaken day and night by the sound of steel explosions. During the day, enemy planes bombed and strafed in groups, and the artillery was like a rapidly firing machine gun. At night, flares lit up the sky, and the giant cannons emitted dazzling flames and deafening roars, just like the violent thunder and lightning in midsummer.
    In this extremely unfair battle of strength, the enemy used howitzers against us, and we used hand grenades against the enemy. However, our soldiers defended optimistically and with full confidence. During the most intense periods of the battle, the soldiers passed the word to each other in the fortifications: "Stay calm. Anyway, the higher-ups have a plan. It looks like another Second Campaign." What does the Second Campaign mean? The Second Campaign represents the enemy's great defeat in late November and early December of last year, with a loss of 30,000 to 40,000 men. In the command posts at all levels, people heard a common voice: "The Yingzishen position must not be lost." "Hill 584 must be held." A certain company near Hill 303 northeast of Gyeongan-ri had only five or six men. The second platoon leader came to ask the company commander: "Should we still defend this position?" The company commander said to him: "We are not defending, but attacking!" At night, the five or six soldiers of this company voluntarily asked to join the battle ranks of the friendly army and launched a surprise attack on the enemy, regaining the position lost during the day.
    During these eighteen days and nights of fierce fighting, countless letters of determination were sent to command posts at all levels. Without exception, the letters of determination were filled with these glorious words: "I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and I guarantee to hold my position." "I am a soldier of the Korean People's Army, and the position I defend will not be lost." Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Korean People's Army, these are two glorious names. These two glorious names mean: we can attack and we will win; we can defend and we will succeed. This magnificent spirit had already crushed the insignificant enemy. Here, I would like to mention the names of two fearless soldiers, He Deyuan and Qian Shujun. He Deyuan is a 46-year-old veteran who has traveled all over half of China and personally participated in the glorious wars that defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. After the victory of the Liberation War, He Deyuan was ordered to retire and return to his increasingly prosperous hometown. After the American aggressor army reached the Yalu River, He Deyuan shouldered his machine gun for the second time and joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Before the start of the defensive battle on the south bank of the Han River, He Deyuan was ordered to conduct reconnaissance in Jiangnan. When wading across the river, he was knocked down by a drifting ice floe, and the machine gun pressed on his left arm, breaking his strong wrist. When the defensive battle on the south bank of the Han River began, the instructor asked He Deyuan if he could still go to the position. He Deyuan said: "Instructor, don't worry. I am a Communist Party member. Since joining the army, I have never been absent from a battle. Even if my wrist is injured or my arm is broken, I will go to fight." Qian Shujun is an excellent machine gun shooter. In the blocking battle on the front line of Xiulishan north of Suwon, he killed more than 100 enemies by himself. The enemy charged his machine gun twelve times, and each time they were defeated. After the enemy's five unsuccessful charges, they used a guy who could speak Chinese to shout at him: "Chinese, surrender! Your light weapons are useless." Qian Shujun squatted in the fortifications and cursed: "Chinese people don't surrender. Come on, you little bastards! We don't have people, but we have plenty of bullets." After failing to deceive him, the enemy bombarded him with artillery. Qian Shujun was buried in the soil several times, but he did not panic. While shooting, he repaired the fortifications. The enemy's twelve charges were all repelled, and Qian Shujun was neither injured nor did he lose his position. That day, Qian Shujun fired more than 1,300 bullets, killing an average of one enemy for every ten bullets.
    In the face of such high morale and fearlessness of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, many difficulties were gradually being overcome. Food was sometimes difficult to obtain, so the soldiers tightened their belts during the day and waited for the heroic laborers to deliver supplies at night. These laborers walked from the north bank of the Heilongjiang River to the south bank of the Han River. Water was difficult to obtain, so the soldiers grabbed a handful of snow and put it in their mouths. Sometimes the snow was tainted by the smoke and gunpowder of the artillery fire, so the soldiers picked up two smooth pebbles, induced saliva, and moistened their parched throats. Ammunition was difficult to obtain, so the soldiers automatically stipulated: "We don't fire machine guns unless there are four enemies, and we don't throw grenades unless there are three enemies." The enemy's artillery fire was strong, so the soldiers carefully constructed their own fortifications. Many fortifications were equipped with warm straw mats and could withstand dozens of directly hit shells.
    It was these few but brave and invincible soldiers who fought the world's most despicable and barbaric enemy for eighteen days. In the blocking action, the Volunteer Army and the People's Army often voluntarily gave up some positions during the day and then took them back at night. Giving up these positions during the day was to avoid losses that should be avoided. Launching counterattacks at night was to annihilate the enemy's living forces at the most favorable time for us. We were completely in control. As for the enemy, it had been frightened out of its wits by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. On the Gyeongan-ri line, the Americans first launched a full-scale offensive, but failed to take it after a long time. Later, they replaced them with Syngman Rhee's puppet army, but they still failed to take it. Later, they replaced them with the British 29th Brigade, but they still failed to take it. After the Volunteer Army and the People's Army voluntarily withdrew from certain positions, the enemy often did not dare to occupy them for several days. On the Han River to Suwon line, the main force of the Volunteer Army and the People's Army withdrew to the north of the Han River on February 9th, leaving only less than one-tenth of the enemy's strength to deal with the enemy. The enemy did not dare to advance rashly to the Han River within ten days.
    Our soldiers ridiculed the enemy, saying: "Our superiors have a plan. Whatever they tell the enemy to do, they do. The enemy is really obedient."

　　光辉的阻击战
     ——汉江南岸战斗纪实之一
    本报记者  李庄
    从一月二十五日至二月十一日，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在汉江南岸进行了一场历时十八昼夜的阻击战。在这一战线上歼灭美国侵略军一万多人。志愿军和人民军系以少数兵力，抗击人员、装备占绝对优势的敌军。敌军以重大伤亡，每天前进平均不及一公里半。这次阻击战，为中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军二月十一日东线出击，歼敌一万二千余人，解放横城之战造成了重要条件。
    敌人这次进犯汉江的企图是很狂妄的。麦克阿瑟这次企图一举强渡汉江，重占汉城，再把侵略战火烧向“三八”线以北，借以挽回日益破产的麦克阿瑟的威信，并增加正在互相咒骂的侵略集团内部的信心。在一月初解放汉城之战中，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在五百里宽正面上对敌发起进攻，数小时后，突破了敌人筑有永久工事的“三八线”，击溃了大量敌军，一举解放汉城。敌人从“三八线”到水原以南，一泄数百里，从Ａ线逃到了Ｄ线。（当时敌军筑有数道防线，以原“三八线”为Ａ线，议政府至泰川一线为Ｂ线，汉江为Ｃ线，水原以南为Ｄ线）当时，帝国主义侵略集团内部群情大哗，伦敦、巴黎、安哥拉……纷纷咒骂华盛顿，麦克阿瑟被称为“傻瓜”和“疯子”。因此，麦克阿瑟在喘息未定的时候，又发起了这次新的进攻。
    麦克阿瑟在这次冒险进攻中，使用了他在朝鲜百分之九十以上的兵力，共约二十三万人。麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的主力，计有美军七个师，除了所谓“王牌军”陆战一师，因在长津湖一带损失过重战力未复，尚未继续作战外，其余的美军六个师，即骑兵第一师、第二师、第三师、第七师、二十四师、二十五师，都在这一攻势中进到了第一线。此外，麦克阿瑟还使用了两个英军旅、十个李承晚师、一个被打得残缺不全的土耳其旅及荷兰、法国、菲律宾、希腊等国的侵略部队。这次打头阵的，不是伪军而是美军。
    连吃了三次败仗的麦克阿瑟，在这次进攻中，采取了稳扎稳打、齐头并进的战术。他把进攻重点放在西线，即水原至骊州间——八十公里的正面上。在这一线上，他的主要进攻矛头有两个，一从水原出发，沿铁路攻汉城，一从利川与骊州出发，沿着两条公路，攻汉江以南的京安里。在这两路，他使用了四个美军师、两个英军旅、两个李伪军师、一个土耳其旅及希腊、菲律宾等帮凶部队。在骊州以东的原州地区，麦克阿瑟使用了六个多师；在东海岸，麦克阿瑟使用了约四个师，和西线之敌遥相呼应。
    为了“迅速渡过汉江”，麦克阿瑟在汉江南岸投入大量的钢铁和装备。志愿军的战士们说：“除了原子弹，他把什么都使出来了。可就是原子弹，又有什么用处呢？”真的，敌人是把各种“新武器”都使出来了。它对着志愿军的土木野战工事，投掷一吨重的炸弹，对着包括两三个战士的志愿军战斗小组，投掷用降落伞拴系的集团炸弹，它用纳巴姆（凝固汽油弹）烧焦山上的草木和长满藓苔的岩石，它的大炮把志愿军据守的山峦阵地打成了蜂窝。但是，帝国主义的钢铁可以击碎山上的岩石，却不能挫折志愿军和人民军战士无敌的意志。十八昼夜的阻击战，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军完全以轻武器与敌奋战，并有效地打败了麦克阿瑟的战争机器。
    汉江南岸的地形，并不是利于防御的。志愿军和人民军是背水作战，扼守着一个纵深不过六、七十里的桥头阵地。那时候，冰冻的汉江已经开始融化，在五百多米宽的江面上，两岸还结着坚冰，江心浮着流动的冰块。汉江上的两座大桥早已被美军炸毁，我军在冰上架的临时浮桥，已经为春水所浸没。从汉城至水原，南部是迂回起伏的邱陵，北部是汉江平川，非常有利于敌人坦克的活动。从利川、骊州至京安里一线，山沟多是从南往北，也便利于敌人坦克、重炮的进出。这里的汉江南岸，峭壁矗立，也增加了我军运输供应的困难。汉江在京安里以东，分成南北两源，南汉江自东南来，北汉江自东北来。南北汉江之间的横城，此时已为敌军占领，因此，汉江以南的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，是深入敌人的侧后方作战。
    汉江南岸志愿军和人民军少数部队的任务是艰巨的。但是他们光辉地完成了艰巨的任务。
    日日夜夜，汉江南岸的战斗惊天动地地进行着。汉江两岸的原野和山峦，昼夜为钢铁的爆炸声所震动，白天，敌军成群结队地轰炸扫射，排炮就和猛烈速射的机枪一样，入夜，照明弹把天空打得通红，巨炮发出耀眼的火光和震聋耳鼓的轰声，俨如仲夏时分狂暴的雷鸣和电闪。
    在这个力量极不公平的战斗中，敌人用榴弹炮打我们，我们用手榴弹打敌人。但是，我们的战士是乐观而又充满信心地防御着。在战斗十分激烈时期，战士们在工事中互相传语：“沉住气。反正上级有名堂，看样子又是个二次战役。”二次战役是什么意思呢？二次战役表示敌人在去年十一月底至十二月初的大失败，三、四万人的大损失。在各级指挥所，人们听到一种共同的声音：“莺子深阵地决不能让。”“五八四高地必须守住。”某连在京安里东北的三○三高地附近，只有五、六个人，二排长走来问连长：“这阵地还守不守呢？”连长对他说：“我们不是要守，而是要攻！”夜里，这个连的五、六个战士，自动要求参加友军的战斗行列，对敌人展开了一个出其不意的攻击，夺回了白天失去的阵地。
    在这十八昼夜的激战中，无数决心书送到各级指挥所里。决心书上无一例外地写着这种光辉的字句：“我是中国人民志愿军，我保证守住我的阵地。”“我是朝鲜人民军，我守的阵地是不会丢的。”中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军，这是两个光荣的名字，这两个光荣的名字表示：我们进可以攻，攻则必克；退可以守，守则必成。这种气壮山河的伟大气概，早已把渺小的敌人压碎了。这里，我愿意提出何德元、钱树俊这两个无畏战士的名字。何德元是个四十六岁的老战士，曾经走遍半个中国，亲自参加了打败了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的光辉的战争。解放战争胜利之后，何德元奉命退伍，回到生活日趋富裕的故乡。美国侵略军打到鸭绿江边以后，何德元第二次扛起机枪，参加了中国人民志愿部队。汉江南岸守备战开始以前，何德元奉命到江南侦察，在涉水过江时，被流冰撞倒，机枪压在左臂上，轧断了他那坚强的手腕。汉江南岸守备战开始了，指导员问何德元，还能不能到阵地上去，何德元说：“指导员放心。我是共产党员，参军以后，没有脱离过一次战斗，不要说手腕子受了点伤，就是胳膊断了，我也要去打仗。”钱树俊是个优秀的机枪射手，在水原以北修理山前沿阵地阻击战中，一个人击毙一百多敌人。敌人向他这挺机枪冲锋十二次，每次都被打垮了。敌人五次冲锋不逞，即以会说中国话的家伙向他喊话：“中国人投降吧！你那轻武器是不行的。”钱树俊蹲在工事中骂道：“中国人没有投降的。小子们来吧！要人没有，要子弹头有的是。”敌人欺骗不成，再以排炮轰击。钱树俊几次被埋到土中，但他毫不慌张，一面射击，一面修理工事。敌人十二次冲锋全被打退，钱树俊既未负伤，更未丢失阵地。这一天，钱树俊打了一千三百多发子弹，平均十发子弹打死一个敌人。
    在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军这种高昂无畏的士气之前，许多困难正被逐渐克服着。粮食有时困难，战士们白天勒勒腰带，等夜里由英勇的民工送来给养。这些民工是从黑龙江北岸走到了汉江南岸的。喝水困难，战士们抓两把积雪放在嘴里。有时积雪被炮火硝烟薰坏了，战士们检两颗光滑的石子，引出口水，湿润枯喉。弹药困难，战士们自动规定：“不够四个敌人不打机关枪，不够三个敌人不打手榴弹。”敌人炮火较强，战士们精心构筑自己的工事，许多工事备有温暖的稻草垫褥，能挡几十发笔直命中的炮弹。
    就是这些为数不多但是英勇无敌的战士，和世界上最卑鄙蛮横的敌人鏖战了十八天。在阻击战中，志愿军和人民军往往在白天主动让出一些阵地，到夜间又把它拿回来。白天让出这些阵地，是为了避免应该避免的损失。晚上发起反击，是为了在这对我最为有利的时机，歼灭敌人的有生力量。我们是完全主动的。敌人呢，它已被中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打得丧魂落魄了。在京安里一线，先是美国人全力进攻，久攻不下。以后换了李承晚的伪军，照样是攻不下。以后又换了英国二十九旅，还是攻不下。在志愿军和人民军主动撤出某些阵地后，敌人则常常几天不敢占领。汉江至水原一线，志愿军与人民军主力于二月九日撤到汉江以北，只留下不及敌方十分之一的兵力与敌周旋，敌人在十天之内未敢冒进到汉江。
    我们的战士嘲笑敌人说：“我们的上级有名堂，叫敌人怎么办，他就怎么办，敌人是真正听话的。”
