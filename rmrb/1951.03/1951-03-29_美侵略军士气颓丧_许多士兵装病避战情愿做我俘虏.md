Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 27th: The morale of the U.S. aggressor troops, who recklessly advanced north, is declining under the heavy blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. According to Derringers, a private first class in the first platoon, first squad, second company, first battalion, 24th Regiment, 25th Division of the U.S. Army, who was captured by a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on March 18, his squad has suffered four casualties since the reckless offensive. U.S. soldiers are very afraid of the strong defenses of the Korean and Chinese people's forces. Derringers said: "Whenever we attack a hill, the only hope of our soldiers is that there are no people from your side on the hill. If we find someone, then we quickly roll down the hill, otherwise we will be killed on the hill. When we advance, our hearts are pounding, not knowing where bullets will come from. Although it is already spring, we still feel that the nights are too long, we are terrified and dare not sleep peacefully, not knowing when a grenade will explode next to us." Derringers mentioned the growing pessimism within the aggressor troops. Soldiers sigh and hope to return home, and there are many cases of self-injury and feigning illness. A soldier named Ordiz in Derringers' squad broke three bones in his foot with a carbine in order to return home. U.S. soldiers often try to raise their body temperature to pretend to be sick and avoid combat.

Many U.S. soldiers, after learning about the lenient policy of the Korean and Chinese people's forces towards prisoners, are willing to be prisoners in order to save their lives. On the night of March 18, several warriors of a volunteer army unit discovered two U.S. sentries fast asleep in an area northeast of Seoul. The warriors woke these two guys up and asked them to follow. These two American soldiers obediently followed down the mountain. As soon as they arrived at the volunteer army's position, they eagerly asked for food and clothing. One of them said, "I know you don't beat or kill prisoners, and you even give them food." These two soldiers from the U.S. 25th Division had full beards, were covered in mud, and looked haggard. They said, "We fight during the day, running around, and at night we are so tired that we fall asleep." Roykin, a telephone operator from the Fourth Company, 19th Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, was very happy after being captured by the Volunteers. He had participated in three battles and was not injured. He said: "Because I didn't want to die, I ran very fast backwards every time, so I was not injured." Now he is very fortunate to be a prisoner of the Volunteers, because he will no longer have to flee in panic during combat as he used to.

　　美侵略军士气颓丧
    许多士兵装病避战情愿做我俘虏
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】冒险北犯的美国侵略军，在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军痛击之下，士气颓丧。据在三月十八日被中国人民志愿军某部俘虏的美军二十五师二十四团一营二连一排一班上等兵德里更斯供称，他的这个班自从冒险进攻以来，已经伤亡了四个人。美军士兵对朝、中人民部队的坚强防御，十分害怕。德里更斯说：“每逢进攻一个山头，我们士兵们的唯一希望就是山上没有你们的人。如果发现有人，那我们就赶快滚下山来，不然就会被打死在山上。我们向前开进时，心中蹦蹦乱跳，不知道什么地方会有子弹射来。现在虽然已是春季，我们还是感觉夜太长，提心吊胆，不敢安心睡觉，不知道什么时候就会有手榴弹在身边爆炸。”德里更斯提到侵略军内部日益增长着悲观情绪。士兵们唉声叹气，盼望回国，自伤和装病的很多。德里更斯同班有一个名叫欧第斯的士兵，用卡宾枪自己打断了三根脚骨，以达到回国的目的。美军士兵们常常想办法提高自己的体温，装作有病，躲避战斗。
    许多美军士兵在了解了朝、中人民部队的俘虏政策以后，情愿做俘虏，以便保全自己的性命。三月十八日晚，志愿军某部的几个勇士在汉城东北某地发现有两个正在呼呼大睡的美军哨兵。勇士们推醒了这两个家伙，要他们跟着走。这两个美国兵就很驯服地跟着走下山来。他们一到志愿军阵地后，就急着要饭吃，要衣穿。其中一个说：“我知道你们对俘虏不打不杀，还给饭吃。”这两个美军第二十五师的士兵满腮胡须，浑身泥土，憔悴得不像个人样子。他们说：“我们白天打仗，东奔西跑，一到夜晚就疲倦得倒头大睡。”美军第二十四师十九团四连的电话员罗以金，在被志愿军俘虏以后，非常高兴。他曾参加过三次战斗，都没有负伤。他说：“我因为不愿意送死，每一次都向后跑得很快，所以没有负伤。”现在他很庆幸他当了志愿军的俘虏，因为以后可以不用再像从前那样在作战中仓惶逃命了。
