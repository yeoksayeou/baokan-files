　　Egg Products
    In rural China, almost every household raises chickens as a side occupation. Farmers often sell their eggs to exchange for oil, salt, and daily necessities. The provinces with the highest egg production nationwide are Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangxi, Hebei, Chahar, and the Northeast regions. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in 1950, there were approximately 205.6 million chickens in the country, capable of producing over 16.4 billion eggs annually. If four eggs are equivalent to one jin of rice, this could be exchanged for 4 billion jin of rice. If all were sold, it would significantly increase the income of the masses.

    Throughout the years, exports of fresh eggs and processed egg products from China have consistently ranked third or fourth among exported goods. Egg exports began after the Qing Dynasty opened up to foreign trade. Initially, fresh eggs, preserved eggs, and salted eggs were shipped to Japan for re-export to Britain and the United States. After 1901, German and British merchants successively established factories in major cities such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou to manufacture dried and frozen egg products for export. After 1911, Chinese industrial and commercial circles also established factories inland for manufacturing. The number of egg factories increased from about 30 to around 100. In 1936, exports reached 47,826 tons of frozen eggs, 9,073 tons of dried eggs, and 38 million fresh eggs. If all converted to fresh eggs, this would be equivalent to 272.208 million eggs. This was the year with the highest egg product export value before the War of Resistance Against Japan. From the War of Resistance until liberation, the egg industry constantly suffered under the oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capital due to the devastation caused by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, lacking opportunities for development. In 1947, only 30 tons of dried eggs and 70,000 fresh eggs were exported, totaling 3.07 million eggs when converted to fresh eggs, only 1.1% of the 1936 figure, illustrating the overall decline of the egg industry.

    In 1949, with the basic liberation of the country, the foreign trade developed rapidly with the strong support of the People's Government. The foreign sales of Chinese egg products became active again. Egg product manufacturers across the country resumed operations one after another. Nine companies resumed operations in the spring of 1949, increasing to 23 by the end of the year, and then surging to 55 by the end of 1950. Including the four frozen egg factories that resumed operations in Tianjin and Qingdao, there were a total of 59 factories. The egg factories that had already started production manufactured 35,000 tons of frozen eggs and approximately 20,000 tons of dried eggs. In terms of export volume, egg products equivalent to 53 million fresh eggs were exported in 1949. In 1950, exports included 6,995 tons of dried eggs, over 21,000 tons of frozen eggs, and approximately 200 million fresh eggs, totaling nearly 1.7 billion fresh eggs (including those exported in January this year), representing a tremendous development compared to 1949. This not only demonstrates the expansion of China's egg industry, allowing industrial and commercial operators engaged in the egg industry to operate with peace of mind, but also resolves part of the farmers' livelihood issues. Based on an average of four eggs per jin of rice, farmers earned nearly 400 million jin of rice in income last year, which not only solves the need for oil, salt, and daily necessities, but also addresses the clothing needs of farmers in colder regions. According to a survey by the Suiyuan Egg Products Company, the province needs 2 million bolts of homespun cloth annually. In 1950, the currency invested by the Egg Products Company in purchasing eggs was equivalent to 400,000 bolts of homespun cloth, enabling farmers who could not afford warm clothing to obtain clothing. At the same time, purchasing eggs in disaster areas also resolved the livelihood issues of some disaster victims.

    Last year, the China Egg Products Company also began establishing egg product trade relations with Eastern European People's Democratic countries, creating new markets for China's egg products. In the future, in addition to striving for foreign markets, domestic sales in major cities should be organized. Under this new situation, Chinese public and private manufacturers and exporters must change their past blind production and export methods, and leverage various relationships to actively seek sales channels. In order to implement planned production and marketing, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has decided to convene a national conference on the production and sales of public and private egg products in the near future to further address production and sales issues.

　　蛋品
    我国农村中家家户户都把养鸡当作副业，农民常以所产的鸡蛋，出售后换回油、盐和日用必需品。全国各地鸡蛋产量最多的属江苏、安徽、湖南、湖北、四川、广西、河北、察哈尔及东北各地。据中央人民政府农业部一九五○年统计，全国共约二亿零五百六十多万只鸡，每年可以产鸡蛋一百六十四亿多枚。如以四个蛋换一斤米折算，可以换四十亿斤米。如果全部销售了，则能给群众增加不少的收入。
    我国历年鲜蛋及制蛋品的出口，差不多常占输出物资的第三位和第四位。从满清对外通商后，蛋类即开始出口。由鲜蛋、皮蛋、咸蛋输往日本转销英、美开始，至一九○一年以后，德、英商相继在天津、青岛、汉口等大城市设厂制造干蛋品、冻蛋品以经营出口。一九一一年以后，我国工商业界亦相继在内地设厂制造，蛋厂由三十家增加到百家左右，一九三六年曾出口冰蛋四七、八二六吨，干蛋九、○七三吨，鲜蛋三八、○○○万枚。如全部折成鲜蛋，即等于出口了鲜蛋二七二、二○八万枚。这是我国抗战前蛋品出口额最高的一年。抗战以后到解放以前，由于日寇及国民党反动派的摧残，使蛋业经常呻吟在帝国主义与官僚资本的铁蹄下，没有发展的机会。一九四七年仅出口干蛋三○吨，鲜蛋七万枚，全部折合鲜蛋共三○七万枚，仅等于一九三六年的百分之一点一，可见蛋业凋蔽的一般。
    一九四九年，全国基本解放，由于人民政府的大力扶助，对外贸易的相继开展，我国蛋品的外销又见活跃。全国蛋业的厂商纷纷复业，一九四九年春复业的九家，到年底增到二十三家，到一九五○年底已经开工生产的激增至五十五家，连同天津、青岛开工生产的冰蛋厂四家，共五十九家。已经开工的蛋厂，生产冰蛋三五、○○○吨，干蛋约二○、○○○吨，在外销数量上，一九四九年出口蛋品折合鲜蛋计五三、○○○万枚，一九五○年出口干蛋六、九九五吨，冰蛋二一、○○○多吨，鲜蛋约在两亿枚以上，共折合鲜蛋将近十七亿枚（包括今年一月出口的），较一九四九年有了飞跃的发展。这不仅可以看出我国蛋业的扩展，使从事蛋业的工商业者得以安心经营，而且也解决了农民的部分生活问题。如以平均斤米四蛋计，去年一年农民可获得将近四亿多斤米的收入，不但可以解决吃油吃盐和解决日用必需品的需用问题，而且在寒冷地区也解决了农民穿衣问题。据绥远蛋品公司调查，该省全年需土布二百万匹，一九五○年蛋品公司收购鸡蛋投放的货币折合土布达四十万匹，使穿不暖的农民获得了穿衣。同时在灾区，经收购鸡蛋后，也解决了部分灾民的生活问题。
    去年中国蛋品公司又开始建立了与东欧人民民主国家的蛋品贸易关系，为我国的蛋品创造了新的市场。今后的蛋品销路，除争取国外市场外，应组织各大城市的内销。在这一新的情况下，我国公私厂商、出口商除利用各种关系、多方寻找销路外，过去的那种盲目的自行生产出口的方式，则须改变。中央人民政府贸易部为了实行有计划的生产推销，已决定于最近召开全国公私营蛋品产销会议，以进一步解决产销问题。
