　　Review of "Distant Village"
　　Chen Boping
　　"Distant Village" reflects the great rural struggles during our People's Liberation War. It is set in a village in Northeast China. It was May 1947, and the Northeast People's Liberation Army was conducting a fierce summer offensive on the front lines, achieving great victories. At that time, in the vast liberated rural areas, many cadres, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, went to the countryside to mobilize and organize farmers, raise their political awareness, carry out land reform, develop agricultural production, and change the social landscape and the psychological outlook of the vast number of farmers. This was a very complex and intense struggle.

　　Wang Hanlong—the protagonist of the film "Distant Village"—and his lover, Zhang Juan, were sent by the Provincial Chairman to Taohuachuan, a remote, backward, and complex new district, to work. The Provincial Chairman made their task very clear: "...Today, the farmers have already obtained land from the landlords. The issue now is how we lead the farmers to develop production. A country like ours can only accumulate capital for industry through agricultural production, and only then can we transform our agricultural country into a modern industrial nation..."

　　However, the backward and complex reality of Taohuachuan presented a huge obstacle to completing the aforementioned task. Landlord Dong Batian and the Kuomintang reactionary agent Li Jiantou, etc., exploited the farmers' living difficulties and ideological backwardness, carrying out insidious provocations and undermining production and construction. To grasp this situation and change it, our leading cadres had to possess a firm revolutionary stance, clear policy viewpoints, rich work experience, correct work methods, and excellent work style. All of this is very clearly embodied in Wang Hanlong, the District Party Secretary and District Head. From the first day of his arrival, in the face of a severe and complex struggle, he consistently relied on the masses, mobilized them through key figures, and isolated the landlords and agents. He first understood the actual situation, considered problems from the perspective of the actual situation, took the masses as his teachers, and in turn, influenced the masses, educated them, and led them forward. He not only used words but also used the masses' own actions and work achievements to enlighten their consciousness and raise their political and ideological level and revolutionary enthusiasm. He did not separate himself from the masses, nor did he tail after them. This is the fundamental reason why he was able to lead the masses to overcome various obstacles and achieve final victory.

　　This film is a vivid and lively educational material for both cadres and the masses. It uses fleshed-out images to tell us how to effectively raise the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, how to deal with die-hard evil landlords and agents, and how to be an excellent revolutionary cadre.

　　In terms of character development, Old Stubborn is the most prominent. In the old society, in remote villages, such old men were often encountered. He was backward, stubborn, and persistent. He measured and judged everything based on his old experiences. He viewed new people and new things with old eyes. The persecution of the old society had made him hot-tempered. A provocative word could turn him into a ball of fire. Such a person, of course, could easily fall prey to the tricks of reactionary elements and be exploited by them. Under Dong Batian's secret instigation, Old Stubborn opposed the construction of the dam, disrupted meetings, and even led violent actions, causing great damage. He was practically deaf to persuasion and warnings. Only iron-clad facts, only visible practical benefits, could start his brain and change his attitude. When the gurgling water flowed out of the sluice gate of the newly built dam, a spring-like smile appeared on his wrinkled old face. At the Taohuachuan harvest celebration a year later, when the Provincial Chairman called on everyone to continue developing production, supporting the front lines, and striving to completely defeat American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, he and everyone else raised their powerful arms and cheered together. This is a truly fleshed-out, characteristic image, and his impression on us is so profound! Compared to this vivid image, other images appear dim. The character of Zhang Juan is unnecessary. If the author attempted to portray the transformation process of a female cadre from a petty-bourgeois background through this character, it clearly did not achieve its purpose.

　　This film is basically successful. It appears simple, natural, and realistic. It makes people realize: this is our country's distant village!

　　The revolutionary struggle and great victory of the distant village are of great significance to the nationwide struggle and construction cause. Our glorious Communist Party and the People's Government's revolutionary policies, as well as the revolutionary cadres who correctly implement those policies, once combined with the masses, become an invincible force for transforming society, transforming nature, and transforming the thinking of the masses. This force can turn backwardness into progress, deserts into fertile fields, and agricultural countries into industrial countries! The changes in Taohuachuan a few years ago, as well as the current new face of Northeast China and even the whole of China, are not eloquent proof of the power of this force, showing the brilliant future of new China?

　　评《辽远的乡村》
      陈卜平
    《辽远的乡村》反映了我国人民解放战争中的农村伟大斗争。它是以东北农村为背景的。那是一九四七年五月，东北人民解放军正在前方进行着剧烈的夏季攻势，而且取得了伟大的胜利。当时，在已经解放了的广大的农村中，许多干部，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，下乡发动与组织农民，提高其政治觉悟，进行土地改革，发展农业生产，改变乡村的社会面貌和广大农民的心理面貌。这是一场非常复杂而剧烈的斗争。
    王汉龙——影片《辽远的乡村》中的主角和他的爱人张娟，被省主席派到偏僻落后、情况复杂的新区桃花川去工作。关于他们的工作任务，省主席说得非常清楚：“……今天农民已经从地主手里取得土地，今后的问题，就看我们如何领导农民发展生产。像我们这样的国家只能以农业生产给工业积累资本，将来才能把我们的农业国家变为现代化的工业国。……”
    然而桃花川的落后复杂的实际情况，乃是完成上述任务的巨大阻力。地主东霸天和国民党反动派的特务李尖头等利用农民的生活困难和思想落后，进行了险毒的挑拨离间，破坏生产建设。我们的领导干部要掌握这种情况，改变这种情况，就得有坚定的革命立场、明确的政策观点、丰富的工作经验、正确的工作路线和优良的工作作风。而这一切都非常鲜明地表现在区委书记兼区长王汉龙的身上。他从到任的第一天起，在严重的复杂斗争过程中，始终依靠群众，通过骨干分子带动群众，孤立地主和特务。他首先了解实际情况，从实际情况出发考虑问题，拜群众为老师，而又回过来影响群众，教育群众，领导群众前进。他不但用言语而且用群众自己的行动和工作成绩来启发群众的自觉，提高群众的政治思想水平和革命的热情。他不脱离群众，也不做群众的尾巴。这就是他能够领导群众克服了种种障碍而获得最后胜利的基本原因。
    这部影片对于干部、对于群众，都是生动活泼的教育材料，它用血肉丰满的形象告诉我们如何有效地提高农民群众的政治觉悟和生产热情，如何对付至死不悟的恶霸地主和特务，如何做一个优秀的革命干部。
    在人物的塑造上，倔老头是最凸出的一个。在旧社会里，在偏僻的乡村，这样的老头是常常可以碰到的。他落后、固执、顽强。他根据自己的老经验衡量一切，推断一切。他用旧眼光看新人新事。旧社会的迫害给他造成一个火性子。一句挑拨的话能够使他变成一团火。这样的人，当然很容易中反动分子的毒计，被他们所利用。在东霸天的暗中煽动下，倔老头反对修坝，捣乱会场，甚至领头动武，起了很大的破坏作用。对于劝说和警告，他简直是个聋子。只有铁一般的事实，只有看得见的实际福利，才能开动他的脑筋，改变他的态度。从新修的堤坝的闸门放出潺潺水流的时候，他的打皱的老脸上才出现了春阳般的微笑。在一年后桃花川庆祝丰收大会上，当省主席号召大家继续发展生产，支援前线，为彻底打垮美帝国主义和国民党反动派而奋斗时，他和大家一同举起了有力的臂膀，一同欢呼。这是一个真正有血、有肉、有性格的形象，他给我们的印象是那样深刻！跟这个鲜明的形象比较起来，其他形象都显得黯淡了。张娟这个人物是不必要的。如果作者企图通过这个人物来表现小资产阶级出身的女干部的改造过程，那显然没有达到目的。
    这部片子基本上是成功的。它显得朴素，自然，真实。它使人认识到：这才是我们祖国的辽远的乡村！
    辽远的乡村的革命斗争及其伟大的胜利，对全国范围的斗争和建设事业来说，是有很大意义的。我们光荣的共产党和人民政府的革命政策以及正确执行政策的革命干部，一旦与群众结合起来，就成为改造社会、改造自然、改造群众思想的无敌力量。这种力量能使落后变为进步，沙漠变成良田，农业国变成工业国！几年前的桃花川的改变以及目前东北乃至全中国的崭新的面貌，不是雄辩地证明了这种力量的强大，显示了新中国的光辉远景吗？（附图片）
