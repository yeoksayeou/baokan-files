    The Northwest Region's Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is Developing

    Since the launch of the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we have gained in all aspects:

    First, it has improved the cadres. Before the Korean War, many cadres had muddled ideas, mainly a sense of complacency. One was: they thought the world was at peace; however, the sound of the U.S. imperialists' cannons made them doubt their own strength. Another was: they not only ignored the crisis of international imperialist war, but also the complacency regarding specific enemies (bandits, special agents). Even more widespread was the neglect of ideological problems existing among the masses, overestimating the achievements of our political education after liberation, underestimating the influence of imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary propaganda over the years, and belittling the rumors spread by special agents and secret societies. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Korean War, especially after the U.S. imperialists landed at Incheon, people were shaken for a time, and bandits and special agents took advantage of our initial propaganda of a quick victory in the Korean War to carry out activities on a large scale and spread rumors everywhere. Only then did we discover that many problems in the masses that we thought had been resolved (such as fear of war, fear of the U.S., and fear of the atomic bomb) had not been resolved, and even individual cadres and League members were afraid and did not work. This was all the result of the Party's propaganda work being divorced from the actual thinking of the masses. Since the unfolding of current affairs propaganda, the sense of complacency has been broken, and with the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers, confidence in the victory of the struggle against U.S. imperialism has also increased, resolving the purely peaceful construction thinking of some comrades. They all felt that there was still an arduous struggle with U.S. imperialism ahead, which means their political awareness has been further enhanced.

    Second, it has great educational significance for the broad masses of people. Now the movement has begun to penetrate from government offices, schools, and factories to the business community, religious circles, and other strata, from large and medium-sized cities to the countryside, and has progressed from general lectures and reports and forums to parades and demonstrations by all ethnic groups and sectors, to workers' great production competitions, youth joining the army, the business community enthusiastically paying taxes, and the signing of patriotic pacts, and is continuing and developing. Reports from various places all mention this point, that is, the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War and the victory of Wu Xiuquan's struggle at the United Nations General Assembly have had a great impact. Some people even quoted classics saying: "I have not found in the history of the past three hundred years that the Chinese can defeat foreigners. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, I have seen it with my own eyes." (A teacher in Lanzhou) Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses is extremely high. In Xi'an City, after the students' independent parade on December 9, the business community, education sector, church schools, and workers followed suit, each with more than 5,000 people participating; the same was true in Lanzhou, Dihua, Xining and other cities. The original mobilization of 1,500 people to join military cadre schools resulted in more than 15,000 people signing up. Many women also competed to sign up for their children. Lei, an old lady in Lianhua Street, Xi'an City, sent all seven of her children to the revolution. From December 11 to 25, women in Xi'an City voluntarily made more than 2,800 comfort bags for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, wrote 3,000 comfort letters, and various other items. The total amount of condolences from all sectors of the city was 230 million yuan. At present, production competitions are being carried out in various places, and new records have emerged. For example, in the patriotic competition of the Chengfeng Flour Mill in Xi'an, the daily output increased by 930 bags compared to before, the task of ten days was completed in nine days, and 15 tons of coal were saved. The Yumen Oil Mine and the Xi'an Power Plant completely relied on workers to repair machines that could not be completed during the enemy and puppet era. When a machine in the Dahua Yarn Factory malfunctioned, it was originally planned to be repaired in two days, but the workers completed it in three hours. The Chang'an Wuxingzhong shunting team created a new record of 312 safe hooks within eight hours, and the Baoji Locomotive Depot completed 100,000 safe kilometers of travel, and locomotive No. 702 has been accident-free for 300 days. Many workers donated their production bonuses to the soldiers of Korea and China. Recently, in the organization of the Korean comfort delegation, democratic figures from various places are competing to go. In short, wherever the propaganda for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea penetrates deeply, whether in cities or rural areas, there is momentum, and there are fewer rumors. As the railway workers in Chang'an said, "Since October, the United States has become stinky."

    Third, it has enhanced the concept of loving the motherland among ethnic minorities. In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionary clique's Han chauvinist policy and the result of creating ethnic disputes, especially among ethnic minorities in the border areas, the concept of the motherland was not strong enough. Since liberation, because we have implemented the correct ethnic policy and paid attention to the interests of ethnic minorities in economic and trade aspects, and since the outbreak of the Korean War, all localities have paid more attention to the work of current affairs propaganda among ethnic minorities, convened forums for various ethnic groups, absorbed upper-level figures and activists from ethnic minorities, as well as imams and lamas to participate, and organized various forms of propaganda teams to inspire them to express their attitudes. Representatives of various ethnic groups in Qinghai and Xinjiang have issued declarations, making them feel that they have the opportunity to express their opinions on national affairs, which is really very different from the past. In addition, the frequent victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers have also increased the confidence of various ethnic groups. They also demand the same as what the Han people want to achieve. For example, the people who signed up for the army in Dihua City included nine ethnic groups: Han, Uygur, Hui, Tajik, Kazakh, Mongolian, Uighur, Manchu, and Russian. This situation was unimaginable during the Kuomintang rule.

    After several months of work, the problems that can be seen are:

    1. Current affairs propaganda is sometimes cold and sometimes hot. Since the turning of the Korean War situation, the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has slackened in various places. Many comrades are not consciously raising the political awareness of the people step by step through the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, creating an unprecedented patriotic upsurge. Some comrades also do not pay attention to this movement, and regard it as merely the business of the propaganda organs. Therefore, many places have failed to integrate the anti-imperialist movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea with the anti-feudal and counter-revolutionary suppression movement, carrying out this movement in isolation, which reduced the profound, rich, and vivid content of the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    2. The development of the movement is extremely uneven. Cities are better, rural areas are worse. Nearby is better, far away is weaker. Government offices, schools, and factories are better, other sectors are worse. Taking Xi'an City as an example, according to statistics on November 19 last year: 65,000 people had listened to special current affairs reports, and about 300,000 people had directly heard the propaganda, and a regular lecture class of more than 30 responsible cadres was formed. Xi'an factories conducted more than 50 reports. However, the situation in other regions is worse. Recently, Gan Yifei, the Minister of Propaganda of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, went to Huaxian County for inspection, and some villages still did not know what Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was all about, and some people even asked: "I heard that China is fighting again, I don't know if it's true or false?"

    3. The propaganda methods are simple, not in-depth, not combined with action, and have formalistic problems. The broad masses of activists have not been truly organized, that is, many patriotic covenants are still mostly handled by cadres or a few activists, and are not truly carried out by the masses consciously and voluntarily. Therefore, in many places, the masses still have a phenomenon of not caring about Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    Recently, we plan to improve this work from the following aspects:

    (1) Improve the organization. At present, the Northwest Region and the branches of the Peace Preservation and Anti-American Aggression Committee and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various provinces do not have full-time and capable cadres. Some even regard it as a group for sending documents, making telegrams, and making social engagements. People cannot be invited to the meetings, and no one is responsible for doing things. The Peace Preservation and Anti-American Aggression Committee and other groups are the best organizational forms for uniting people from all walks of life to carry out Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and current affairs propaganda. The past neglect must be corrected.

    (2) Seize the establishment of a propaganda network. Oppose the view of some comrades who are indifferent to this work, and strive to establish a propaganda员 system universally within this year. First of all, it is the reporter system.

    (3) The Party committee should lead the entire movement and regularly check and discuss this work. At present, we focus on correcting the shortcomings of propaganda being divorced from reality and one-sidedness, and establishing a long-term view of current affairs education.

    (4) Strengthen the editing and distribution of propaganda员 manuals. 50,000 copies of the propaganda员 manual have been issued, and according to the population ratio, it is already a mass publication. Doing a good job in this publication and improving the distribution work is of great significance to promoting the entire current affairs propaganda.

    (5) Launch a movement against the U.S. imperialists' unilateral peace treaty with Japan and launch a movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in ethnic minority areas. (The situation reflected in this article is based on materials from February)

### 西北区抗美援朝运动在发展中

专栏：为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争

    西北区抗美援朝运动在发展中
    抗美援朝运动展开后，我们的收获是各方面的：
    首先是提高了干部。在朝鲜战争以前，干部中有许多糊涂思想，主要是太平观念。一种是：以为天下太平了；但是，美帝国主义炮声一响，却又怀疑起自己的力量来。一种是：不仅忽视国际帝国主义战争的危机存在，而且更忽视具体敌人（土匪、特务）的麻痹思想。而更大量普遍存在的则是忽视群众中存在着的思想问题，过高估计解放后我们政治教育的成就，过低估计帝国主义、国民党反动派多年欺骗宣传的影响，轻视特务、会道门的谣言活动，因而朝鲜战争爆发，特别是美帝国主义登陆仁川后，一时人心波动，土匪特务利用我们朝鲜战争初期宣传速胜的缺点，大肆活动，谣言四起，才发现群众中好些我们以为已经解决了的问题（如恐战、恐美、恐原子弹问题），还未解决，甚至个别干部、团员有害怕而不工作者，这都是党的宣传工作脱离群众思想实际的结果。自时事宣传展开后，打破了太平观念，而随着中国人民志愿军的胜利，对于和美帝国主义斗争的胜利信心也增高了，解决了某些同志单纯和平建设的思想，都感到还有着和美帝国主义的艰巨斗争在前面，也就是政治觉悟更提高了一步。
    其次，对于广大人民群众的教育意义很大。现在运动已经从机关、学校、工厂开始深入向工商界、宗教界及其他阶层，从大城市、中小城市深入向农村，已经由一般作讲演报告、开座谈会到各族各界游行示威，到工人生产大竞赛，青年参军，工商界踊跃纳税，纷纷订立爱国公约的行动中，并在持续和开展。各地报告都提到这一点，即中国人民志愿军在朝鲜作战的胜利，伍修权在联合国大会斗争的胜利，影响极大，有的人竟引经据典的说：“中国人能打败外国人，我在三百年以来历史上都没有找到，今天在中国共产党领导下，我亲眼看到了。”（兰州一教员）因而群众情绪极高，西安市自十二月九日学生单独游行后，紧接着工商界、教育界、教会学校、工人都单独举行，每次都在五千人以上；兰州、迪化、西宁等城市也如此。参加军事干部学校原动员一千五百名，报名一万五千余名。许多妇女也争着替儿女报名，西安市莲花街雷老太太，把七个儿女都送来革命，自十二月十一日至二十五日西安市妇女自动为中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军赶做慰问袋二千八百余个，写慰问信三千封，其他物品多种。全市各界慰问金二亿三千余万元。目前各地正开展生产竞赛运动，都有新纪录出现，如西安成丰面厂在爱国主义竞赛中，产量每日夜较前增九百三十袋，十天任务九天完成，还节省煤十五吨。玉门油矿及西安电厂，完全依靠工人修好了敌伪时代不能完成的机器。大华纱厂机器发生毛病，原计划两天修好，结果工人花了三小时即完成。长安吴兴中调车组，完成八小时内创造三一二安全钩的新纪录，宝鸡机务段完成十万安全行走里，七○二机车已三百天无事故。许多工人将生产奖金捐赠朝中战士。最近组织朝鲜慰问团，各地民主人士均争着要去。总之，凡是抗美援朝宣传深入的地方，无论城市农村都有了劲，谣言也少了，正像长安铁路工人说“自十月份起，美国就臭了”。
    第三、在少数民族中增强了爱祖国的观念。过去，由于国民党反动派大汉族主义政策及制造民族纠纷结果，特别是边疆少数民族，对于祖国观念是不够强烈的。自解放后，由于我们执行了正确的民族政策，在经济贸易方面注意了少数民族利益，以及自朝鲜战争发生后，各地都比较注意了在少数民族中时事宣传的工作，召开了各民族座谈会，吸收少数民族上层人士及积极分子以及阿訇、喇嘛参加，组织各种样式的宣传小组，启发他们表示态度。青海、新疆各民族代表都发表了宣言，使他们觉得国家大事可以有他们发表意见的机会，果真与前大不相同，加之，中国人民志愿军捷报频传，各民族中信心亦为增高，各地凡是汉族要作到的，他们也要求一样，如迪化市参军报名的人，就包括汉、维、回、塔、哈、蒙、乌、满、俄九个民族，此种情况，是在国民党统治时代想象不到的。
    几个月工作以后，可以看得出的问题是：
    一、时事宣传，时冷时热。自朝鲜战局扭转后，各地抗美援朝运动就松了劲。许多同志不是有意识地经过抗美援朝运动，一步一步地提高人民政治觉悟，造成一个空前的爱国主义高潮。也有同志不重视此一运动，把他看成仅仅是宣传机关的事。因而，许多地方就没有能使抗美援朝的反帝运动和反封建镇压反革命的运动很好结合起来，孤立地去进行此一运动，减少了抗美援朝运动的深刻丰富的生动内容。
    二、运动的发展极不平衡。城市好一些、农村差一些。近处好一些，远处淡一些。机关、学校、工厂好一些，其他阶层差一些。以西安市来说，去年十一月十九日统计：听过专门时事报告有六万五千人，直接听到宣传的群众约三十万人，并形成经常的三十余负责干部的演讲班，西安各工厂就进行了五十余次报告。但是其他地区情形就差些，最近陕西省委宣传部长甘一飞同志到华县去检查，有的乡村还不知抗美援朝是怎么回事，有的人还问：“听说中国又在打仗，不知是真是假？”
    三、宣传方式简单，也不深入，未与行动结合和有形式主义毛病。没有真正把广大的群众积极分子组织起来，即是许多爱国公约，大多还是干部或少数积极分子包办，并不是真正通过群众自觉自愿，由群众自己动手来搞的。因而，许多地方，群众对抗美援朝仍有不关心现象。
    最近打算从这几方面，改进此项工作：
    （一）健全机构。目前西北区及各省保卫世界和平反美侵略委员会分会、中苏友好协会，均无专职有力干部。有的甚至只把他看成发文通电、交际应酬团体，开会请不来，作事无人负责。保卫世界和平反美侵略委员会分会等团体，是团结各界人士进行抗美援朝、时事宣传的最好组织形式，过去不重视，是要纠正过来的。
    （二）抓紧建立宣传网。反对某些同志对此工作冷淡的观点，务须争取年内普遍建立宣传员制度。首先是报告员制度。
    （三）党委要领导整个运动，定期检查与讨论此一工作。目前着重纠正宣传脱离实际与片面性的缺点，建立长期的时事教育观点。
    （四）加强宣传员手册编辑和发行。宣传员手册已发行五万份，按人口比例，已是一群众性刊物。办好这一刊物与改善发行工作，对推进整个时事宣传有重大意义。
    （五）开展反对美帝国主义片面对日和约运动和掀起少数民族地区抗美援朝运动。（本文所反映的情况是根据二月份的材料）
