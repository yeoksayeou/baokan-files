　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 30th: The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the battles to resist the invasion of the US-led aggressor troops and the Li Syngman puppet army on both sides of the Han River, have achieved the brilliant result of annihilating 50,000 enemy troops in 49 days due to their adherence to the operational policy of annihilating the enemy's effective strength.

　　From October 25th of last year to January 5th of this year, in 73 days, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers annihilated more than 62,000 enemy troops. However, the troop losses of the US, British, and other invading forces and the Li Syngman puppet army in the 49 days from January 25th to March 14th of this year reached 50,000, equivalent to six-fifths of the total troop losses in the past three campaigns. Among them, the US invading forces suffered even more severe losses, with an estimated 25,000 troops annihilated. This figure exceeds the total number of US troops annihilated in the first three campaigns.

The main captures included 433 artillery pieces of various types, 11,691 guns of various types, 13 tanks, 658 vehicles of various types, more than 30,000 artillery shells of various types, and more than 460,000 bullets of various types.
