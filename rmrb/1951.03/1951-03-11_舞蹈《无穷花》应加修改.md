　　The Dance "Mugunghwa" Should Be Modified
    To the Editors:
    The Central Academy of Drama recently performed some new-style dance pieces, such as "The Little Bugler" and "Harvest Time," which were very popular with the audience. But I have some opinions on one of the programs, "Mugunghwa," which I am writing down now.
    This dance depicts a Korean girl picking morning glories in the field, dancing happily and gracefully. Later, an American soldier comes along and wants to insult her. The chasing scenes are also expressed through dance: a twist, a hug, a pounce, a dodge. Finally, the girl is caught by the American soldier, and she takes the opportunity to pull out his pistol from behind and kill the beast. The theme of this dance—opposition to U.S. imperialism—is certainly good, but I think its method of expression is inappropriate. Is there no other way to express it? How can the crimes of American beast soldiers raping women be narrated through lyrical dance? How incongruous it is to use such a couple's dance to express such a story! Moreover, the subsequent chasing scenes completely destroy people's sense of beauty from the original dance of the girl's labor. Especially in the twists, hugs, pounces, and dodges, the actress fully expresses the girl's soft and beautiful figure, and the movements are in harmony with the melody. The more beautiful it is, the more disgusting it is.
    I think that if you want to keep this program, you should modify it.
    I am a layman, but I felt very unhappy after watching it, and I straightforwardly put forward the above opinions for the reference of the Central Academy of Drama Dance Troupe.

### 舞蹈《无穷花》应加修改

　　舞蹈《无穷花》应加修改编辑同志：
    中央戏剧学院最近演出一些新型的舞蹈小品，如《小司号员》、《收割的时候》等，很受观众欢迎。但我对其中的一个节目《无穷花》有一些意见，现在写在下面。
    这舞蹈描写一个朝鲜的女郎在田野中采摘牵牛花，她愉快地优美地舞蹈着。后来来了一个美国兵，要侮辱她。那些追逐的场面也是用舞蹈来表现的：一扭、一搂、一扑、一躲，后来终于给美国兵搂住了，女郎乘隙在美国兵的背后拔下他的手枪，把这兽兵打死。这舞蹈的主题——反对美帝国主义，当然是很好的，可是我觉得它的表现方法不妥当。难道没有别的方法来表现吗？美国兽兵强奸妇女的罪行怎么能用抒情的舞蹈来叙述呢？用这样的男女对舞来表现这类故事是多么不调协呵！而且后来的追逐场面，也根本破坏了人们对于原来的女郎的劳动的舞蹈的优美感。尤其是在一搂、一扭、一扑、一躲之间，演员充分表现了那女郎的柔美的体态，与动作的合乎旋律。越是美丽越是令人作呕。
    我认为，如果要保留这个节目，便应该加以修改。
    我是个外行，但看了后很不愉快，直率地提出上面的意见，以供中央戏剧学院舞蹈团的参考。
