　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: Chinese People's Volunteers and Korean People's Army demonstrated a high degree of friendship, unity, and mutual assistance during nearly two months of joint operations in the Suwon-Hanseong area. The US invading forces advancing north along both sides of the Suwon to Hanseong highway suffered serious blows under the coordinated and fierce attacks of the Korean and Chinese People's forces.

　　Before each battle, the Korean and Chinese People's forces sent representatives to jointly study how to coordinate operations. During the fighting, the two armies frequently exchanged information about the enemy situation in a timely manner; news of victories on both sides spread quickly to each other; and a surge of competition to annihilate the enemy unfolded among the Korean and Chinese warriors.

　　On one occasion, the Korean People's Army took over a position on the east side of the highway from a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Before the handover, the enemy had occupied a high ground that threatened the position. In order to prevent their Korean comrades from being threatened, the Chinese Volunteers launched a fierce attack on the enemy and did not officially hand over the position until they had recaptured the high ground. After taking over the position, the Korean People's Army warriors immediately used powerful firepower to cover the Chinese Volunteers' attack and withdrawal.

　　In battle, the Korean and Chinese warriors provided mutual fire support and protected each other's flanks. One day, a unit of the Korean People's Army crossed the Han River to the south and attacked the enemy. When they returned victoriously, the road was blocked by the enemy. The Chinese Volunteer soldiers on the bridgehead position on the north bank of the Han River immediately used powerful firepower to kill and wound the enemy, supporting the safe return of the Korean People's Army attacking force. On another occasion, when a unit of the Chinese Volunteers was fighting at a bridgehead on the south bank of the Han River and was suppressed by enemy fire, the Korean People's Army gunners immediately opened fire to bombard the enemy, suppressing the enemy's firepower and covering the Chinese Volunteers' victorious counterattack.

　　The Korean and Chinese heroes also frequently exchanged operational experience in shooting down planes and tanks. The anti-aircraft units and anti-aircraft gunners of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army created a brilliant record of shooting down and damaging 74 enemy planes in one month and seven days. A certain unit of the Chinese Volunteers once created the glorious achievement of completely annihilating a British Royal Heavy Tank Battalion in a battle. In these battles, mutual learning, research, and encouragement between the Korean and Chinese comrades played a significant role.

　　In the great struggle to eliminate the American invading forces, the blood of the Korean and Chinese people flowed together, and victory was jointly created.

　　中朝人民部队在水原汉城一带
    互相协助打击美军表现高度友爱精神
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在水原汉城一带将近两个月的并肩作战中，表现了高度的友爱团结、互相协助的精神。沿着水原到汉城公路两侧向北进犯的美国侵略军，在朝、中人民部队协同痛击之下，遭到了严重的打击。
    朝、中人民部队在每一次战斗前，都曾派出代表共同研究如何协同作战。作战中两军经常及时互通敌情；双方作战的捷报也迅速互相传播；朝、中勇士之间展开了歼敌竞赛的热潮。
    某次，人民军接防公路东侧志愿军的一个阵地。在换防前，敌人攻占了足以威胁这个阵地的一处高地。志愿军的勇士们为了使人民军战友们不至受到威胁，向敌人展开了猛烈的攻击，直到把高地夺回后才正式换防。人民军勇士们在接防后，也立即以强大火力掩护志愿军出击和转移。
    在战斗中，朝、中勇士们互相用火力支援，互保侧翼的安全。有一天，朝鲜人民军一部南渡汉江，袭击敌人。当他们凯旋归来时，道路被敌人阻断了。汉江北岸桥头阵地上的志愿军战士立即用强大火力杀伤敌人，支援人民军出击部队安全北返。另一次，志愿军一部在汉江南岸桥头堡作战，受到敌人火力压制，人民军的炮手们马上开炮轰击敌人，压倒敌人的火力，掩护志愿军进行胜利的反击。
    朝、中英雄们还经常互相交流打飞机、打坦克等作战经验。人民军某部的防空部队和对空射击手们，在一个月零七天中，创造了击落、击伤敌机七十四架的光辉纪录。志愿军某部在一次战斗中曾创造全歼英国皇家重坦克营的辉煌战绩。在这些战斗中，朝、中战友们互相学习、研究以及激励，都起了很大的作用。
    在消灭美国侵略军的伟大斗争中，朝、中人民的血流在一起，胜利也是共同缔造的。
