Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 22nd: Over 50,000 people from religious circles in Shanghai held a demonstration and parade on the 21st to oppose the US arming of Japan. Participants included Christians, Catholics, Buddhists, and Muslims, as well as teachers, students, and staff from over 130 church schools. Twenty-six Korean Christians also joined the parade.

The marching contingents from various religious units gathered at the Racecourse (跑马厅) in the city center. Hu Wenyao, President of Aurora University, addressed the assembly. He said: "Today, we, the religious circles of Shanghai, have formed a well-organized, solemn, and powerful patriotic force. This action clearly tells the American imperialists and their lackeys that we, the vast number of Christians, Catholics, Buddhists, and Muslims in China, as well as all the teachers, students, and staff of church schools, love our great motherland and resolutely oppose the US rearming of Japan. We are determined to thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialist cultural aggression and sever all ties with imperialism. We loudly tell the imperialist elements: your妄想 (wàngxiǎng - wild attempts) to continue aggression by using religious and cultural undertakings will completely fail." Dou Shaoqi, a representative of the returning volunteers from the Korean War, was invited to speak at the assembly, and the whole audience responded with thunderous applause. After passing telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, the demonstration parade began.

The parade was led by a huge portrait of Chairman Mao. In the Christian contingent of over 9,000 people, the followers held aloft many cartoons exposing the aggressive crimes of US imperialism, some with titles such as: "US Imperialism – A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!" In the Catholic contingent of over 2,800 people, more than 80% had never participated in an assembly or parade before, including over 200 female followers in their sixties. In the ranks of over 2,500 Buddhists were monks and nuns from over 100 temples and monasteries in Shanghai. The marching contingents of teachers, students, and staff from church schools numbered over 35,000 people. Hong Lanyou, a 63-year-old professor from Soochow University, and Diao Deren, a 64-year-old professor from St. John's University, also participated in the parade along with the students. The marching masses held aloft banners reading "Eliminate the Influence of US Imperialist Cultural Aggression" and continuously shouted slogans such as "Oppose the US Arming Japan" and "Sever All Ties with Imperialism."

The parade of religious circles received a warm welcome from people of all walks of life in Shanghai. At important street corners, citizens temporarily set up many propaganda stations to cheer and pay respects to the parade.

    【新华社上海二十二日电】上海市宗教界五万余人于二十一日举行反对美国武装日本的示威大游行。参加游行的包括基督教、天主教、佛教、回教的教徒和一百三十多所教会学校的师生员工。有二十六位朝鲜基督徒也参加了游行行列。
    各宗教单位的游行队伍在市中心跑马厅会场集合。震旦大学校长胡文耀向大会致词。他说：“我们上海市宗教界今天组成了一支整齐、严肃、壮大的爱国队伍。这一行动明白地告诉了美帝国主义者和它的走狗，我们中国基督教、天主教、佛教、回教和所有宗教的广大教徒以及教会学校的全体师生员工们是热爱我们伟大的祖国的，是坚决反对美国重新武装日本的。我们有决心彻底肃清帝国主义文化侵略的影响，割断与帝国主义的一切关系。我们响亮地告诉帝国主义分子们：你们妄想利用宗教和文化事业继续进行侵略，那是完全办不到的。”志愿军归国代表窦少毅应邀到大会讲话，全场报以暴风雨般的欢呼。大会在通过向毛主席致敬电、向中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬电后，开始示威游行。
    游行队伍以毛主席的巨幅画像为前导。在九千多人的基督教大队中，教徒们高举着许多幅揭露美帝国主义侵略罪行的漫画，有的漫画的标题是：“美帝国主义——披着羊皮的豺狼！”在二千八百多人的天主教大队中，有百分之八十以上的人从未参加过大会或游行的，其中有二百多个六十多岁的女教友。在二千五百多个佛教徒的行列中，有上海市一百多个寺庵的僧尼。教会学校师生员工的游行队伍有三万五千多人。东吴大学六十三岁的老教授洪兰友、圣约翰大学六十四岁的老教授刁德仁等，也都和学生们一道参加了游行。游行群众高举着写着“肃清美帝国主义文化侵略影响”的旗帜，并不断地高呼“反对美国武装日本”、“割断与帝国主义的一切联系”等口号。
    这一宗教界的游行队伍受到上海市各界人民的热烈欢迎。在重要的街口，市民们临时设立了许多宣传站，向游行队伍欢呼致敬。
