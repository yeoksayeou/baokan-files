Cherish the Motherland's Beautiful Forests
		Songjiang Province Dailing Experimental Forest Farm – Careless Logging Destroys Trees
To the Editor:
	Liu Xiquan, director of the Dailing Experimental Forest Farm under the Forestry Administration Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government, failed to implement the regulations for clearing the forest farm, resulting in a serious waste of timber, and also felled many excellent trees and mother trees. In early December 1950, Comrade Liu Xiquan led workers into the mountains to clear the forest farm. Because he did not follow the regulations for clearing the forest farm, he did not thoroughly remove "sugar pockets," "ant nests," "standing poles" (various tree diseases), decayed wood, stumps, and obstructed timber, but instead felled most of the strong, excellent trees, disease-free seed-bearing mother trees, and well-shaped mature trees; he also felled the embankment protection trees on both sides of the river.
	The felled trees were not harvested according to regulations. The stumps (the part of the tree trunk left on the ground after felling) were between 30 and 70 centimeters high (should not exceed 20 centimeters); the tree tops were scattered all over the mountains. This not only wasted timber, but also hindered the growth of young trees. Many of the felled trees were mother trees left over from the past. When producing timber, they should have been made into first-class long timber (i.e., 8-meter-long shipbuilding material); however, he sawed all the felled timber into 6-meter, 5-meter, and 4-meter general materials, and put them in the same lumberyard (a place for storing timber) regardless of quality; some of them were military industrial materials (Amur cork tree, Manchurian ash), which were also indiscriminately cut into short pieces, making them unable to be used for more valuable materials. Moreover, many excellent materials were sawn into 1-meter-long pieces of wood and then split into halves. This caused a serious waste of materials.
	We have criticized the Dailing Forest Farm for not conducting the clearing according to regulations. Although the Forestry Administration Department of the Provincial People's Government has expressed its acceptance; however, this phenomenon of not conducting the clearing according to regulations is still continuing. Therefore, we are telling you this situation, hoping to attract the attention of relevant parties.

	Editor's Note: The behavior of Liu Xiquan, director of the Dailing Experimental Forest Farm, in destroying mountains and forests and wasting timber is detrimental to the interests of the people and should be immediately corrected and subjected to a deep self-criticism. The Forestry Administration Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government is also wrong in failing to stop this behavior that harms the interests of the people in a timely manner.

			Some Opinions on Clearing Forest Farms
To the Editor:
	I am a forestry worker. After I came to the Northeast, I saw some shortcomings in the clearing work of two or three forest farms, and I would like to offer some opinions.
	The work of clearing forest farms is an important part of nurturing forest regeneration and growth. When carrying out this part of the work, it is first necessary to clarify the specific purpose of the clearing work, which is to nurture forest regeneration and growth. In the clearing work, it should be combined with logging and utilization, but this combination is to achieve the clearing purpose more economically. As far as I know, the clearing work of a certain forest farm in the Northeast is not like this. They used the slogan of combining clearing with logging and utilization to cover up the erroneous practice of emphasizing logging and underemphasizing clearing from a purely profit-making point of view. Therefore, the phenomenon of the forest farm changing its appearance due to excessive clearing has occurred, which weakens the role of clearing and even endangers the growth of the forest farm. Therefore, my opinion is that before clearing a forest farm, a thorough plan must be made, and the clearing work must be carried out strictly in accordance with the plan, and cannot be decided arbitrarily by individual leaders and those in charge of the clearing.

　　爱护祖国美丽的森林
            松江省带岭试验林场  采伐无方林木受摧残编辑同志：
    松江省人民政府农林厅林政处带岭试验林场主任刘喜权，不执行清理林场的规定，造成了木材的严重浪费，并将许多优良林木和母树都砍伐了。一九五零年十二月上旬，刘喜权同志率领工人入山清理林场。因为他没有按照清理林场的规定，将“红糖包”、“蚂蚁哨”、“站杆”（树的各种病态），朽木以及伐根、困山木等进行彻底的清除，而是将健壮的优良树、无病的能结籽的母树和树形良好的成年树大部砍光；并且把河边两岸的护堤树也砍光了。
    已伐的树木，也没有按照规定进行采伐，伐根（树木被伐以后留在地上的树干）都在三十公分至七十公分（应不超过二十公分）之间；稍头木扔的满山都是。这样，不仅是浪费了木材，而且要妨碍幼树的成长。已伐树木中，很多是过去留下的母树。造材时，本应造成一等长材（即八米长的造船材料）；但是他却将已伐的木材都锯成了六米、五米、四米的一般材料，并且不分好坏地归在一个楞场（堆存木料的场所）；其中有一些是军工用材（黄波罗、水曲柳），也都没有区别地截成了短件子，使之不能作更有用的材料。更有很多优良材料被锯成一米长的木头后，又被劈成两半的大柈子。造成了材料的严重浪费。
    我们对带岭林场不按规定进行清理的现象曾提出批评，省人民政府农林厅林政处虽已表示接受；但是，这种不按规定进行清理的现象，现在还在继续着。因此，我们将此情况告诉你们，希望能引起有关方面的注意。
             东北森林工业总局带岭分局  吕运昌、李平、曹健民
    编者按：带岭试验林场主任刘喜权这种破坏山林、损失木材的行为，是损害人民利益的，应该立即纠正并进行深刻的检查。松江省人民政府农林厅对此种损害人民利益的行为未能及时制止，也是不对的。
            对清理林场工作的一点意见编辑同志：
    我是一个林业工作者。我到东北以后，看到两三处林场的清理工作中存在一些缺点，特提出一点意见。
    清理林场的工作，是抚育森林更新成长过程中一个重要部分。在进行这部分工作时，首先要明确清理工作的具体目的，是为了抚育森林更新成长。在清理工作中应该与采伐、利用相结合，但是这种结合是为了更经济的达到清理目的。就我所知，东北的某林场的清理工作却不是这样的，他们以清理与采伐利用相结合的口号掩护了从单纯营利观点出发的重采伐轻清理的错误作法，因此，产生了因过度清理而使林场变了相貌的现象，这就减弱了清理的作用，甚至危害了林场的成长。因此，我的意见就是：在清理林场以前，必须作出周密的计划，清理工作必须严格地依照计划进行，而不能由个别的领导与指挥清理的人自作主张。
