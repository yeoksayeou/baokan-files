　　Women Comrades of the Volunteer Army Directly Subordinate Units Send a Telegram to Cai Chang to Congratulate the "March 8th" Festival

[Reported by this newspaper] All the women comrades of the directly subordinate units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front sent a telegram to Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, to congratulate her on the "March 8th" Women's Day. The telegram is as follows:

　　"The 'March 8th' International Women's Day has arrived. This great festival is a memorial day for women's struggle for freedom and equality. For many years, we have been persisting in the struggle for peace. Today, the imperialists are carrying out a frenzied war of aggression, attempting to occupy Korea, arm Japan and West Germany, and then enslave the whole world. We, all the women comrades of the directly subordinate units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, stand on the forefront of resisting aggression today, and resolutely use practical actions to smash the conspiracy of the warmongers and defend lasting world peace. We guarantee that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will study hard, improve our skills, unite women of all strata, give full play to our positive leading role, and strive for the liberation of Korean women and oppressed women all over the world."

    【本报讯】在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军直属队全体女同志致电中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅，祝贺“三八”妇女节。电文如下：
    “三八”国际妇女节到了，这伟大的节日，是妇女争取自由平等的纪念日。多少年来，我们一直在为和平而坚持斗争，今天，帝国主义者又在进行疯狂的侵略战争，企图侵占朝鲜，武装日本和西德，进而奴役全世界。我们中国人民志愿军直属队的全体女同志，今天站在反抗侵略的最前线，坚决以实际行动来粉碎战争贩子的阴谋，保卫世界持久和平。我们保证在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，努力学习，提高业务，团结各阶层妇女，发挥积极带头作用，为朝鲜妇女、为全世界受压迫的妇女争取解放而斗争。
