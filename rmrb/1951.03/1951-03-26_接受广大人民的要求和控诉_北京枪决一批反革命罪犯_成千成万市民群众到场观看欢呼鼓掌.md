[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Beijing Municipality, accepting the demands and accusations of the broad masses of the people, and based on the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolution" of the Central People's Government, executed a batch of KMT (Kuomintang or Nationalist Party) spies, heads of reactionary secret societies, habitual bandits, and despots on the 25th. These counter-revolutionary elements all served as traitors and spies during the periods of Japanese puppet rule or KMT rule, brutally killing the people. After liberation, they persisted in their evil ways, sabotaged factories and enterprises, and plotted armed rebellions. Some, after being arrested and treated with leniency, still resisted reform, developed spy organizations, and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. They were all counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes, deserving death.

Among the counter-revolutionary criminals executed this time, a large number were the chief culprits who had committed evil deeds for many years, long engaging in slaughtering the people, burning down houses, sabotaging revolutionary work, and suppressing workers' and students' patriotic movements. Among them, Li Suhou, a KMT Major General special agent, once used machine guns to shoot and kill more than 1,000 people in Yishui County, Shandong. KMT special agent Ji Shian was a veteran special agent who colluded with imperialists to arrest and kill revolutionary martyrs such as Li Dazhao twenty-four years ago. KMT special agent Zhu Shilin arrested more than 200 revolutionary workers and progressive people in Baoding, and personally strangled 15 people. KMT special agent Zhou Jun, the Colonel Director of the Shangrao Inspection Office, arrested and killed large numbers of patriotic people who escaped from the Shangrao concentration camp. Bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek personally gave him twelve blank "handwritten orders" to encourage him to massacre the people at any time and any place. KMT special agent Shi Songquan burned down more than 400 houses and captured and killed six people's guerrillas. Dou Deyao was a special envoy of the bandit Yan Xishan's special agent organization, the "National Revolution Comrades Association," and developed more than 6,000 fascist special agents, killing 23 revolutionary cadres. Li Xiaoyu served as a KMT special agent for more than ten years and was one of the "Four King Kongs" of the bandit leader Ma Hansan. When he was the section chief of the military service section of the puppet civil affairs bureau, he forcibly conscripted more than 10,000 citizens of Beijing from February 1947 to June 1948 to serve as cannon fodder for the KMT bandits. Jiang Hongtao was a KMT colonel team leader and the head of the reactionary secret society, Xiantian Dao, who had stolen more than 2,000 pieces of intelligence from the liberated areas and killed four revolutionary cadres. KMT special agent Tian Bihua was the president of the bandit Beiping Special Criminal Court. More than 200 patriotic people were sentenced to death by him. KMT special agent Zhao Zhenlun worked as the judicial team leader of the Beiping bandit Criminal Police Team, and, together with Liao Renzhao, the director of the KMT "Beiping Detention Center," interrogated revolutionary workers such as Yu Xinqing and Meng Xiangong using various tortures. KMT special agent Ma Zhenyuan was a big traitor in the working class. Before liberation, he actively suppressed the workers' movement. He once colluded with the bandit garrison headquarters and arrested more than 20 progressive workers from the Beijing Tram Company at one time. Leng Shaoying, a commissioner of the KMT North China District Office, Zhao Zhongrong, deputy minister of the KMT Youth Department, Zhang Minzhi, deputy chairman of the KMT Beiping Municipal Party Department, and Lü Ping, a member of the Municipal Party Department Executive Committee and head of the Organization and Training Section, were all the chief culprits in suppressing the Beijing student patriotic movement before liberation. They repeatedly directed special agents and thugs to beat student marching teams, arrest more than a hundred patriotic teachers and students, and break into schools such as Peking University, Normal University, Chaoyang University, Hebei High School, and Huiwen Middle School to commit atrocities, causing many major bloody incidents such as "May 18th" and "April 9th". Yang Binlou was the head of a Beijing gang. At the time of liberation, he colluded with the bandit leader Zhang Yinwu to organize the "North China People's Self-Rescue Association," gathering more than 200 landlords who had fled in fear of punishment, plotting to obstruct the liberation of Beijing.

There was a group of special agents and bandits who, after liberation, lurked in Beijing, sabotaging factories and enterprises, stealing state secrets, seriously endangering social order and damaging the safety of people's property. Among them, Dong Huachang, a KMT special agent who infiltrated the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau, served as the head of the directly subordinate group of the first brigade of the bandit "Tianjin Road Hidden Sabotage General Team" after liberation. He had planned to sabotage locomotives three times, destroy trade union organizations, and incite employees to be passive and slow down work. Tian Feng, a KMT special agent who infiltrated the Fengtai Locomotive Factory, continuously sabotaged train boilers and Locomotive No. 1586 after liberation, making it impossible for the train to run frequently. KMT special agent Li Zhixiang, who had severely tortured revolutionary cadres, lurked in the Changxindian Railway Factory after liberation and personally sabotaged ten locomotive wind gauges and many other equipment such as wind pumps and water pumps. KMT special agent Yu Tingbo secretly carried a radio station into Zhangjiakou after the liberation of Beijing and served as the colonel leader of the Zhangjiakou Group of the KMT Military Intelligence Bureau, specializing in stealing military and political secrets of the People's Government and reporting them to the bandit side. KMT special agent Xie Wenxuan colluded with KMT special agents Li Xumin and Luo Lifu, who were sent back from Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek, after liberation to open stores as special agent bases and shelter radio stations in Mentougou, plotting sabotage. Fu Zhongyi, a KMT special agent who lurked in Beijing after liberation, was a notorious despot in Qinghe Town. Before liberation, he led the bandit "Anti-Communist Pioneer Team" to beat patriotic marching students. After liberation, he forged the seal of the 19th District People's Government and fled to Xuzhou, seeking contact with the bandit side. After returning to Beijing, he forged a migration certificate, lurked, and carried out sabotage. Ji Haoran, a district captain of the puppet Central Police Academy, forged RMB after liberation to disrupt finance and forged the official seal of the People's Government to privately make northeast freight certificates, disrupting the national economy. Liu Wenhai, a lieutenant communications officer of the KMT North China Headquarters, collected photos of the leaders of our People's Government after liberation in an attempt to carry out assassinations. Fu Fengwu, the leader of the Beijing West Suburbs Intelligence Group of the puppet North China Headquarters, had captured and killed 14 members of the Communist Party. After liberation, he refused to register and planned assassination work for cadres.

There was also a group of special agents and bandits who still persisted in their evil ways after liberation who were executed yesterday. They either resisted registration, organized reactionary armed forces, and plotted to subvert the People's Government, or colluded with habitual bandits, held guns to rob, and injure the victims. Among them, KMT special agent Chen Gongfu organized the "North China Guerrilla Column Headquarters" after liberation, collected guns, and prepared to establish a guerrilla base in the Taihang Mountains, gathering bandits and scattered soldiers from Daqingshan to carry out riots. KMT special agents Du Qingpu, Chen Zidan, Wang Wenhai, and others refused to register after liberation and sneaked to the northwest to organize the "North China Anti-Communist Allied Army." Bandit Du also served as the "Commander of the Fifth Column," developing special agent organizations, plotting armed riots. Long Chao, a colonel commissioner of the KMT Military Intelligence Bureau's Beiping Station, was an old special agent who had committed evil deeds for more than 20 years. At the time of the liberation of Beijing, he had deployed two hidden radio stations and organized more than 30 special agents, plotting to wait for an opportunity to riot. KMT special agent Wang Fengchao was one of the thugs led by bandit leader Diao Huaren, a notorious gunman in Hejian area, Hebei. He had served as a traitor, killing more than 400 people and burning down more than 1,500 houses. After liberation, he lurked in Haidian Town in the western suburbs of Beijing, and colluded with special agent habitual bandits Chen Junmin, Wang Xiufeng, Liu Wenxuan, Wang Fenghui, etc. to rob eight times and injure the victims. KMT special agent Liu Yingnan refused to register after liberation, posing as the People's Liberation Army and robbed seven times, and burned the victims with red-hot iron bars.

There was also a batch of special agent bandits who were executed this time who, after liberation, accepted the lurking tasks arranged by the bandit side, infiltrated agencies, enterprises, and organizations to steal state secrets and supply spies to the bandit side. For example, KMT special agent Wu Hongyou, who served as a lieutenant colonel researcher at the International Issues Research Institute of the Puppet Ministry of National Defense before liberation, specialized in stealing Soviet intelligence. After liberation, he refused to register and lurked in our military agency as a translator, waiting for an opportunity to carry out sabotage. KMT Military Intelligence Bureau "Serving the Country Corps" special agent Li Guiming infiltrated our public security organs after liberation to steal secrets, secretly released four KMT special agents, and colluded to rob and injure the victims. Zhou Jidao, a member of the puppet Youth Party Central Committee, served as a commissioner of the bandit's downstream of the Yangtze River Advancing Army, destroying revolutionary armed forces. After liberation, he refused to register and attempted to sneak into the People's Political Consultative Conference. Wang Shuhua, the head of the student movement group of the KMT Tianjin Municipal Party Department, had arrested a large number of progressive students in Tianjin before liberation. After liberation, he infiltrated the southward working group to carry out sabotage. KMT special agents Hu Jinwen and Pang Hao were both special agents with blood debts. After liberation, they refused to register and attempted to continue to carry out sabotage.

Among the counter-revolutionary elements executed, there was a batch of chief culprits of reactionary secret societies. Before liberation, they were not only traitors, special agents, and puppet baojia chiefs, but also local despotic landlords who had seized land, forced people to death, raped women, extorted money from the people, and committed all kinds of evil. After liberation, they sheltered special agents, incited disciples, and attempted to organize armed riots, and created rumors to undermine the policies and laws of the People's Government. Among them, Deng Yangshan and other reactionary leaders of the Jiugongdao gathered more than 10,000 bandits and plotted to carry out armed riots in June last year. Jin Hankui, the head of the Jiugongdao altar, specialized in creating rumors against the government, insulting the government, and advocating for U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Seven large books and more than ninety kinds of anti-revolutionary rumors were found that were personally created and written by him. Zhao Ziguang, the head of the Yiguandao altar, was a KMT special agent who had suppressed student movements and injured students in the past. After liberation, he organized an intelligence network in the western suburbs to steal intelligence for the KMT Military Intelligence Bureau. Zhang Zhenchuan, the head of Yiguandao, used the trick of "crossing the great immortal" to defraud disciples of fifty taels of gold for his own evil deeds. He also sewed U.S. national flags and the false national flags of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, dreaming of welcoming the U.S. and Chiang bandit gang to make a comeback. Lü Shanting, the head of the Yiguandao altar, was a traitor, a special agent, a puppet baojia chief, and a despotic landlord. He had forced the daughter of villager Xiao Liu to be his daughter-in-law, angering Xiao Liu to death. He also seized ten houses and ten acres of land from the widow Lü Wang. Lin Dianbin, the "genius" of Yiguandao, harbored Zhang Wufu, a key traitor and special agent of Yiguandao, after liberation. A year later, he sheltered Zhang Wufu's escape.

A batch of despotic landlords were among the counter-revolutionary elements executed this time. For example, Wang Tingshu, the notorious despot of Nancaoyuan in the southern suburbs of Beijing, nicknamed "Southern Overlord" and "King of Hell," had served as a special agent for the Japanese military police and was also the head of the Yiguandao altar. He had arrested more than 40 patriotic students and forced twelve farmers to commit suicide. In the southern suburbs, he ran rampant, seizing land from farmer Xia Tonghe and severely beating farmer Wang Yan and others. He also forced to death the mothers of farmers Li Yongxi and Wang Jiahe. After liberation, he secretly organized Yiguandao disciples to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, repeatedly transmitting reactionary documents and spreading reactionary rumors. Shuang Deli, a despotic landlord who had served as a puppet baojia chief for thirteen years, was a traitor and a special agent. He had kicked tenant farmer Gao Shun to death and forced to death farmers Zhao Binggeng, Gao Wenyuan, and hired laborer Han Dezhen. He seized the house of poor peasant Zhao Binggeng. He arbitrarily hanged farmers. When farmers met him, they had to bow to him and shout: "Third Master Shuang," otherwise they would be beaten by him. Special agent despots Lu Huanshan, Lu Huanzhong, and Li Tiebao had shot and buried alive twenty revolutionary cadres and masses. They had raped young girls. After liberation, they hid a machine gun, five rifles, and a box of bullets, plotting a riot.

There was also a batch of special agent bandits whose crimes were originally serious, not only committing many evils before liberation, but also continuing to refuse to repent after the government's excessive leniency after liberation, resisting reform, and insisting on counter-revolutionary activities, who were also executed this time. Among them, KMT Major General special agent Feng Lanting had deployed hidden special agent organizations in Siping, Shenyang, and Beijing. After liberation, during his arrest and detention, he organized the so-called "Association of Comrades in Distress," appointed a commander of the "Guerrilla Army," and attempted to seize weapons to fight "guerrilla warfare" in the Taihang Mountains. KMT special agent Han Zhiqing colluded with special agent Li Chaofan while being released on bail for medical treatment and plotted to escape to Suiyuan to organize special agent armed forces. KMT special agent Ye Yun refused to register after liberation. When he was arrested and placed under control and training, he resisted reform, disrupted production, and incited fellow prisoners, plotting a riot. KMT special agent Zhu Zhenzong escaped from prison after being arrested and resisted reform.

These counter-revolutionary criminals were escorted to the suburban crime areas in batches yesterday afternoon for on-the-spot sentencing, or executed after the victims held accusations. The Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Beijing Municipality posted announcements at each execution site, listing the names and crimes of each criminal in detail. Tens of thousands of citizens came to watch, and they all gnashed their teeth at these counter-revolutionary elements. Some cheered and applauded the execution of these counter-revolutionary elements, and some cursed the counter-revolutionary elements, saying "execution is too good for them" and "they should be torn apart".

    在这次伏法的反革命罪犯中，有一大批是作恶多年，长期屠杀人民、烧毁民房、破坏革命工作、镇压工人和学生爱国运动的反革命首恶分子。其中，像军统少将特务李肃侯，曾经在山东沂水县用机关枪射杀过一千多人。军统特务吉世安是二十四年前勾结帝国主义捕杀先烈李大钊等二十人的老牌特务。军统特务朱士林在保定逮捕过二百多革命工作人员和进步群众，并亲手勒死了十五个人。军统特务、上饶检查所上校所长周俊，曾大批捕杀从上饶集中营逃出的爱国志士，匪首蒋介石曾因此亲手给他十二张空白“手谕”，鼓励他随时随地屠杀人民。军统特务石松泉，曾烧毁民房四百多间，又捕杀六个人民游击队员。窦德耀是匪首阎锡山特务组织“民族革命同志会”的特派员，曾发展法西斯特务六千多人，杀害过二十三个革命干部。李效愚当过十多年军统特务，是匪首马汉三的“四大金刚”之一，他当伪民政局兵役科长时，从一九四七年二月到一九四八年六月曾强抓北京市一万多市民，为蒋匪充当炮灰。江洪涛是军统上校组长，又是反动会道门先天道总会长，曾刺探解放区情报二千多件，杀害革命干部四人。中统特务田璧华是匪北平特刑庭庭长，经他判决杀害的爱国志士有二百多人。军统特务赵振纶做过北平匪刑警队司法组长，和军统“北平看守所”所长廖人钊一起用各种酷刑审问过余心清、孟宪功等革命工作人员。中统特务马振源，是一个大工贼，解放前，积极镇压工人运动，曾勾结匪警备司令部，一次便抓走北京电车公司进步工人二十多个。中统华北区办事处专员冷少颖、国民党青年部副部长赵仲容、国民党北平市党部副主任委员张民治、市党部执行委员兼组训科长吕坪等，都是解放前镇压北京学生爱国运动的首恶分子。他们屡次指挥特务暴徒，毒打学生游行队伍，逮捕爱国师生百余人，并冲入北京大学、师范大学、朝阳大学、河北高中、汇文中学等校行凶，造成“五、一八”、“四九”等大血案多起。杨宾楼是北京流氓头子，解放时与匪首张荫梧合谋组织“华北民众自救会”，纠合畏罪逃亡地主二百多人，阴谋阻挠北京的解放。
    有一批特务匪徒，是在解放以后，潜伏北京，破坏工厂、企业，刺探国家机密，严重地危害社会秩序和破坏人民财产的安全。其中如混入京津铁路局的中统特务董化昌，解放后任匪“平津路潜伏破坏总队”天津第一大队直属分组长，曾有计划地破坏机车三次，破坏工会组织，煽动职工消极怠工。混入丰台机车厂的中统特务田丰，解放后连续破坏火车锅炉和一五八六号机车，使得该车经常不能行驶。中统特务李志祥，曾严刑拷打革命干部，解放后，潜伏在长辛店铁路工厂，亲手破坏机车风表十个和风泵、水泵等许多设备。军统特务于听波，在北京解放以后，暗带电台潜入张家口任匪军统局张家口组中校组长，专门刺探人民政府军政机密，报告匪方。国民党特务谢文煊，解放后勾结蒋匪自台湾派回的特务李许民、罗励甫等开设商店作为特务据点，在门头沟掩护电台，阴谋破坏。解放后潜伏在北京的中统特务傅仲义，是清河镇有名的恶霸，在解放前曾率领匪“清共先锋队”毒打过爱国游行学生，解放后伪造十九区人民政府印信，潜逃徐州，向匪方寻找联系，返北京后又伪制迁移证，潜伏、进行破坏。伪中央警校区队长姬浩然，解放后伪造人民币破坏金融，并伪造人民政府公章，私制东北运货证明，破坏国家经济。军统华北总部中尉通讯员刘文海，解放后搜集我人民政府各首长照片，企图进行暗杀。伪华北总部北京西郊谍报组长傅凤梧，曾捕杀过中共党员十四人，解放后拒不登记，策划暗杀工作干部。
    解放后仍旧怙恶不悛的特务匪徒，昨日也有一批伏法。他们或是抗拒登记，组织反动武装，阴谋颠覆人民政府，或是伙同惯匪，持枪抢劫，伤害事主。其中，如军统特务陈公黻，在解放后组织“华北游击纵队司令部”，收罗枪枝，准备在太行山建立游击根据地，收罗大青山的土匪散兵，进行暴乱。中统特务杜清浦、陈子丹、王文海等，解放后拒不登记，潜往西北，组织“华北剿共联军”，杜匪并充当“第五纵队司令”，发展特务组织。阴谋武装暴乱。匪军统局北平站上校专员龙超，是作恶二十多年的老特务，北京解放时，曾布置潜伏电台两部，组织特务三十余人，阴谋待机暴动。军统特务王凤巢，是匪首刁化仁所领导的暴徒之一，河北河间一带有名的黑枪手，当过汉奸，杀过四百多人，烧毁民房一千五百多间，解放后潜伏北京西郊海淀镇，与特务惯匪陈俊民、王秀峰、刘文轩、王凤会等结伙抢劫八次，并伤害事主。中统特务刘英男，解放后拒不登记，冒充人民解放军，结伙抢劫七次，并用烧红通条烫伤事主。
    还有一批在这次处决的特务匪徒，是在解放以后，接受匪方所布置的潜伏任务，打入机关、企业、团体内部，窃取国家机密，供给匪方的间谍。如军统特务吴鸿猷，解放前充任伪国防部二厅国际问题研究所中校研究员时，专门刺探苏联情报，解放后拒不登记，竟潜伏在我军事机关当翻译，伺机进行破坏。匪军统局“报国团”特务李桂明，解放后打入我公安机关刺探机密，暗中放跑四个中统特务，并结伙抢劫，伤害事主。伪青年党中委周济道，曾任匪长江下游挺进军专员，破坏革命武装力量，解放后拒不登记，企图钻入人民政协会议。国民党天津市党部学运组头子王书华，解放前曾大批逮捕天津进步学生，解放后，潜入南下工作团进行破坏。军统特务胡锦文、庞浩都是负有血债的特务，解放后拒不登记，企图继续进行破坏。
    在伏法的反革命分子中，有一批是反动会道门首恶。他们在解放前不仅是汉奸、特务、伪保甲长，也是当地的恶霸地主，曾经霸占土地、逼死人命、强奸妇女、勒索民财，无恶不作。解放以后，又掩护特务、煽惑道徒，企图组织武装暴乱；并制造谣言，破坏人民政府的政策、法令。其中，如九宫道反动头子邓养山等聚集匪徒万余人，阴谋在去年六月进行武装暴乱。九宫道坛主金汉魁专门制造反对政府、侮辱政府、为美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮张目的谣言，由他亲手制造写成的反革命谣言，被搜出来的就有七大本、九十多种。一贯道坛主赵子光，是中统特务，过去曾镇压学生运动，打伤学生；在解放后，又在西郊组织情报网，为匪军统局刺探情报。一贯道头子张镇川曾用“渡大仙”的鬼计诈骗道徒黄金五十两，供自己作恶；并缝制美国国旗和蒋匪帮伪国旗，梦想欢迎美蒋匪帮卷土重来。一贯道坛主吕善庭，是汉奸、特务、伪保甲长，也是恶霸地主，他曾逼迫村民萧六的闺女做儿媳妇，气死萧六；他还霸占寡妇吕王氏的房十间，地十亩。一贯道“天才”林殿斌，解放后曾窝藏一贯道匪首重要汉奸特务张五福，一年之后，又掩护张五福逃跑。
    这次处决的反革命分子中有一批是恶霸地主。如北京市南郊南菜园大恶霸王廷枢，外号“南霸天”，“阎王爷”，曾经当过日寇宪兵队特务，又是一贯道坛主，曾抓捕爱国学生四十多人，逼得十二个农民自杀。在南郊一带，横行霸道，霸占农民夏同河的土地，毒打农民王阎氏等多人。更逼死农民李永熙的母亲、王嘉禾的母亲等人。解放后，又秘密组织一贯道徒，进行反革命活动，屡次传递反动文件，散布反动谣言。当过十三年伪保长的恶霸地主双德立，是汉奸，也是特务。曾经踢死长工高顺，逼死农民赵秉庚、高文元、和雇农韩德祯。霸占贫农赵秉庚的房子。随便吊打农民，农民遇见他，都得向他鞠躬喊：“双三爷”，不然就遭他毒打。特务恶霸路焕山、路焕仲、李铁宝，曾经枪杀和活埋过革命干部及群众二十人。强奸过幼女，解放后，隐匿机关枪一挺、步枪五枝、子弹一箱，阴谋暴乱。
    还有一批特务匪徒，罪恶本来严重，不仅在解放前作恶多端，并且在解放后经过政府过分宽大处理以后，仍旧不知悔改，抗拒改造，坚持反革命活动，这次也执行枪决。其中军统少将特务冯兰亭，曾经在四平、沈阳、北京布置潜伏特务组织，解放后在逮捕关押期间，又组织所谓“蒙难同志会”，委派“游击军”司令，企图夺取武器，到太行山打“游击”。军统特务韩志清，逮捕后于保释在外就医期间，竟勾结特务李超凡，图谋逃往绥远，组织特务武装。军统特务叶云，解放后拒不登记，逮捕管训时，抗拒改造，破坏生产，并煽动同监犯人，阴谋暴乱。军统特务朱振宗，被捕后越狱逃跑，抗拒改造。
    这批反革命罪犯，是在昨日下午分批押解城郊犯罪地区当场宣判，或由受害群众举行控诉之后执行枪决的。北京市军事管制委员会军法处在各行刑地点，均张贴布告详列各犯名单及其罪行。市民成千成万到场观看，他们对这些反革命分子无不咬牙切齿，有的对处决这些反革命分子欢呼鼓掌，还有的痛骂反革命分子，说“枪决是便宜了他们”，“应该千刀万剐”。
