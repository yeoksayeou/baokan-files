[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Beijing Municipality, accepting the demands and accusations of the broad masses of the people, and based on the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolution" of the Central People's Government, executed a batch of KMT (Kuomintang or Nationalist Party) spies, heads of reactionary secret societies, habitual bandits, and despots on the 25th. These counter-revolutionary elements all served as traitors and spies during the periods of Japanese puppet rule or KMT rule, brutally killing the people. After liberation, they persisted in their evil ways, sabotaged factories and enterprises, and plotted armed rebellions. Some, after being arrested and treated with leniency, still resisted reform, developed spy organizations, and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. They were all counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes, deserving death.

Among the counter-revolutionary criminals executed this time, a large number were the chief culprits who had committed evil deeds for many years, long engaging in slaughtering the people, burning down houses, sabotaging revolutionary work, and suppressing workers' and students' patriotic movements. Among them, Li Suhou, a KMT Major General special agent, once used machine guns to shoot and kill more than 1,000 people in Yishui County, Shandong. KMT special agent Ji Shian was a veteran special agent who colluded with imperialists to arrest and kill revolutionary martyrs such as Li Dazhao twenty-four years ago. KMT special agent Zhu Shilin arrested more than 200 revolutionary workers and progressive people in Baoding, and personally strangled 15 people. KMT special agent Zhou Jun, the Colonel Director of the Shangrao Inspection Office, arrested and killed large numbers of patriotic people who escaped from the Shangrao concentration camp. Bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek personally gave him twelve blank "handwritten orders" to encourage him to massacre the people at any time and any place. KMT special agent Shi Songquan burned down more than 400 houses and captured and killed six people's guerrillas. Dou Deyao was a special envoy of the bandit Yan Xishan's special agent organization, the "National Revolution Comrades Association," and developed more than 6,000 fascist special agents, killing 23 revolutionary cadres. Li Xiaoyu served as a KMT special agent for more than ten years and was one of the "Four King Kongs" of the bandit leader Ma Hansan. When he was the section chief of the military service section of the puppet civil affairs bureau, he forcibly conscripted more than 10,000 citizens of Beijing from February 1947 to June 1948 to serve as cannon fodder for the KMT bandits. Jiang Hongtao was a KMT colonel team leader and the head of the reactionary secret society, Xiantian Dao, who had stolen more than 2,000 pieces of intelligence from the liberated areas and killed four revolutionary cadres. KMT special agent Tian Bihua was the president of the bandit Beiping Special Criminal Court. More than 200 patriotic people were sentenced to death by him. KMT special agent Zhao Zhenlun worked as the judicial team leader of the Beiping bandit Criminal Police Team, and, together with Liao Renzhao, the director of the KMT "Beiping Detention Center," interrogated revolutionary workers such as Yu Xinqing and Meng Xiangong using various tortures. KMT special agent Ma Zhenyuan was a big traitor in the working class. Before liberation, he actively suppressed the workers' movement. He once colluded with the bandit garrison headquarters and arrested more than 20 progressive workers from the Beijing Tram Company at one time. Leng Shaoying, a commissioner of the KMT North China District Office, Zhao Zhongrong, deputy minister of the KMT Youth Department, Zhang Minzhi, deputy chairman of the KMT Beiping Municipal Party Department, and LÃ¼ Ping, a member of the Municipal Party Department Executive Committee and head of the Organization and Training Section, were all the chief culprits in suppressing the Beijing student patriotic movement before liberation. They repeatedly directed special agents and thugs to beat student marching teams, arrest more than a hundred patriotic teachers and students, and break into schools such as Peking University, Normal University, Chaoyang University, Hebei High School, and Huiwen Middle School to commit atrocities, causing many major bloody incidents such as "May 18th" and "April 9th". Yang Binlou was the head of a Beijing gang. At the time of liberation, he colluded with the bandit leader Zhang Yinwu to organize the "North China People's Self-Rescue Association," gathering more than 200 landlords who had fled in fear of punishment, plotting to obstruct the liberation of Beijing.

There was a group of special agents and bandits who, after liberation, lurked in Beijing, sabotaging factories and enterprises, stealing state secrets, seriously endangering social order and damaging the safety of people's property. Among them, Dong Huachang, a KMT special agent who infiltrated the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau, served as the head of the directly subordinate group of the first brigade of the bandit "Tianjin Road Hidden Sabotage General Team" after liberation. He had planned to sabotage locomotives three times, destroy trade union organizations, and incite employees to be passive and slow down work. Tian Feng, a KMT special agent who infiltrated the Fengtai Locomotive Factory, continuously sabotaged train boilers and Locomotive No. 1586 after liberation, making it impossible for the train to run frequently. KMT special agent Li Zhixiang, who had severely tortured revolutionary cadres, lurked in the Changxindian Railway Factory after liberation and personally sabotaged ten locomotive wind gauges and many other equipment such as wind pumps and water pumps. KMT special agent Yu Tingbo secretly carried a radio station into Zhangjiakou after the liberation of Beijing and served as the colonel leader of the Zhangjiakou Group of the KMT Military Intelligence Bureau, specializing in stealing military and political secrets of the People's Government and reporting them to the bandit side. KMT special agent Xie Wenxuan colluded with KMT special agents Li Xumin and Luo Lifu, who were sent back from Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek, after liberation to open stores as special agent bases and shelter radio stations in Mentougou, plotting sabotage. Fu Zhongyi, a KMT special agent who lurked in Beijing after liberation, was a notorious despot in Qinghe Town. Before liberation, he led the bandit "Anti-Communist Pioneer Team" to beat patriotic marching students. After liberation, he forged the seal of the 19th District People's Government and fled to Xuzhou, seeking contact with the bandit side. After returning to Beijing, he forged a migration certificate, lurked, and carried out sabotage. Ji Haoran, a district captain of the puppet Central Police Academy, forged RMB after liberation to disrupt finance and forged the official seal of the People's Government to privately make northeast freight certificates, disrupting the national economy. Liu Wenhai, a lieutenant communications officer of the KMT North China Headquarters, collected photos of the leaders of our People's Government after liberation in an attempt to carry out assassinations. Fu Fengwu, the leader of the Beijing West Suburbs Intelligence Group of the puppet North China Headquarters, had captured and killed 14 members of the Communist Party. After liberation, he refused to register and planned assassination work for cadres.

There was also a group of special agents and bandits who still persisted in their evil ways after liberation who were executed yesterday. They either resisted registration, organized reactionary armed forces, and plotted to subvert the People's Government, or colluded with habitual bandits, held guns to rob, and injure the victims. Among them, KMT special agent Chen Gongfu organized the "North China Guerrilla Column Headquarters" after liberation, collected guns, and prepared to establish a guerrilla base in the Taihang Mountains, gathering bandits and scattered soldiers from Daqingshan to carry out riots. KMT special agents Du Qingpu, Chen Zidan, Wang Wenhai, and others refused to register after liberation and sneaked to the northwest to organize the "North China Anti-Communist Allied Army." Bandit Du also served as the "Commander of the Fifth Column," developing special agent organizations, plotting armed riots. Long Chao, a colonel commissioner of the KMT Military Intelligence Bureau's Beiping Station, was an old special agent who had committed evil deeds for more than 20 years. At the time of the liberation of Beijing, he had deployed two hidden radio stations and organized more than 30 special agents, plotting to wait for an opportunity to riot. KMT special agent Wang Fengchao was one of the thugs led by bandit leader Diao Huaren, a notorious gunman in Hejian area, Hebei. He had served as a traitor, killing more than 400 people and burning down more than 1,500 houses. After liberation, he lurked in Haidian Town in the western suburbs of Beijing, and colluded with special agent habitual bandits Chen Junmin, Wang Xiufeng, Liu Wenxuan, Wang Fenghui, etc. to rob eight times and injure the victims. KMT special agent Liu Yingnan refused to register after liberation, posing as the People's Liberation Army and robbed seven times, and burned the victims with red-hot iron bars.

There was also a batch of special agent bandits who were executed this time who, after liberation, accepted the lurking tasks arranged by the bandit side, infiltrated agencies, enterprises, and organizations to steal state secrets and supply spies to the bandit side. For example, KMT special agent Wu Hongyou, who served as a lieutenant colonel researcher at the International Issues Research Institute of the Puppet Ministry of National Defense before liberation, specialized in stealing Soviet intelligence. After liberation, he refused to register and lurked in our military agency as a translator, waiting for an opportunity to carry out sabotage. KMT Military Intelligence Bureau "Serving the Country Corps" special agent Li Guiming infiltrated our public security organs after liberation to steal secrets, secretly released four KMT special agents, and colluded to rob and injure the victims. Zhou Jidao, a member of the puppet Youth Party Central Committee, served as a commissioner of the bandit's downstream of the Yangtze River Advancing Army, destroying revolutionary armed forces. After liberation, he refused to register and attempted to sneak into the People's Political Consultative Conference. Wang Shuhua, the head of the student movement group of the KMT Tianjin Municipal Party Department, had arrested a large number of progressive students in Tianjin before liberation. After liberation, he infiltrated the southward working group to carry out sabotage. KMT special agents Hu Jinwen and Pang Hao were both special agents with blood debts. After liberation, they refused to register and attempted to continue to carry out sabotage.

Among the counter-revolutionary elements executed, there was a batch of chief culprits of reactionary secret societies. Before liberation, they were not only traitors, special agents, and puppet baojia chiefs, but also local despotic landlords who had seized land, forced people to death, raped women, extorted money from the people, and committed all kinds of evil. After liberation, they sheltered special agents, incited disciples, and attempted to organize armed riots, and created rumors to undermine the policies and laws of the People's Government. Among them, Deng Yangshan and other reactionary leaders of the Jiugongdao gathered more than 10,000 bandits and plotted to carry out armed riots in June last year. Jin Hankui, the head of the Jiugongdao altar, specialized in creating rumors against the government, insulting the government, and advocating for U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Seven large books and more than ninety kinds of anti-revolutionary rumors were found that were personally created and written by him. Zhao Ziguang, the head of the Yiguandao altar, was a KMT special agent who had suppressed student movements and injured students in the past. After liberation, he organized an intelligence network in the western suburbs to steal intelligence for the KMT Military Intelligence Bureau. Zhang Zhenchuan, the head of Yiguandao, used the trick of "crossing the great immortal" to defraud disciples of fifty taels of gold for his own evil deeds. He also sewed U.S. national flags and the false national flags of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, dreaming of welcoming the U.S. and Chiang bandit gang to make a comeback. LÃ¼ Shanting, the head of the Yiguandao altar, was a traitor, a special agent, a puppet baojia chief, and a despotic landlord. He had forced the daughter of villager Xiao Liu to be his daughter-in-law, angering Xiao Liu to death. He also seized ten houses and ten acres of land from the widow LÃ¼ Wang. Lin Dianbin, the "genius" of Yiguandao, harbored Zhang Wufu, a key traitor and special agent of Yiguandao, after liberation. A year later, he sheltered Zhang Wufu's escape.

A batch of despotic landlords were among the counter-revolutionary elements executed this time. For example, Wang Tingshu, the notorious despot of Nancaoyuan in the southern suburbs of Beijing, nicknamed "Southern Overlord" and "King of Hell," had served as a special agent for the Japanese military police and was also the head of the Yiguandao altar. He had arrested more than 40 patriotic students and forced twelve farmers to commit suicide. In the southern suburbs, he ran rampant, seizing land from farmer Xia Tonghe and severely beating farmer Wang Yan and others. He also forced to death the mothers of farmers Li Yongxi and Wang Jiahe. After liberation, he secretly organized Yiguandao disciples to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, repeatedly transmitting reactionary documents and spreading reactionary rumors. Shuang Deli, a despotic landlord who had served as a puppet baojia chief for thirteen years, was a traitor and a special agent. He had kicked tenant farmer Gao Shun to death and forced to death farmers Zhao Binggeng, Gao Wenyuan, and hired laborer Han Dezhen. He seized the house of poor peasant Zhao Binggeng. He arbitrarily hanged farmers. When farmers met him, they had to bow to him and shout: "Third Master Shuang," otherwise they would be beaten by him. Special agent despots Lu Huanshan, Lu Huanzhong, and Li Tiebao had shot and buried alive twenty revolutionary cadres and masses. They had raped young girls. After liberation, they hid a machine gun, five rifles, and a box of bullets, plotting a riot.

There was also a batch of special agent bandits whose crimes were originally serious, not only committing many evils before liberation, but also continuing to refuse to repent after the government's excessive leniency after liberation, resisting reform, and insisting on counter-revolutionary activities, who were also executed this time. Among them, KMT Major General special agent Feng Lanting had deployed hidden special agent organizations in Siping, Shenyang, and Beijing. After liberation, during his arrest and detention, he organized the so-called "Association of Comrades in Distress," appointed a commander of the "Guerrilla Army," and attempted to seize weapons to fight "guerrilla warfare" in the Taihang Mountains. KMT special agent Han Zhiqing colluded with special agent Li Chaofan while being released on bail for medical treatment and plotted to escape to Suiyuan to organize special agent armed forces. KMT special agent Ye Yun refused to register after liberation. When he was arrested and placed under control and training, he resisted reform, disrupted production, and incited fellow prisoners, plotting a riot. KMT special agent Zhu Zhenzong escaped from prison after being arrested and resisted reform.

These counter-revolutionary criminals were escorted to the suburban crime areas in batches yesterday afternoon for on-the-spot sentencing, or executed after the victims held accusations. The Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Beijing Municipality posted announcements at each execution site, listing the names and crimes of each criminal in detail. Tens of thousands of citizens came to watch, and they all gnashed their teeth at these counter-revolutionary elements. Some cheered and applauded the execution of these counter-revolutionary elements, and some cursed the counter-revolutionary elements, saying "execution is too good for them" and "they should be torn apart".
