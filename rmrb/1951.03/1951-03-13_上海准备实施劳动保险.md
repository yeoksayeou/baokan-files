　　Shanghai Prepares to Implement Labor Insurance
    The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and other organizations are actively carrying out various preparatory works for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting on the 7th of this month with the chairmen of the trade unions and labor insurance cadres of various units in the city that are preparing to implement the Labor Insurance Regulations. Specific arrangements were made for this preparatory work. Currently, relevant grassroots trade unions are beginning to conduct publicity and education among employees. The city-wide labor insurance cadre training class is scheduled to begin on March 15th, with more than 700 labor insurance cadres from various industrial trade unions and relevant grassroots trade unions participating in the study. After the training class ends at the end of March, relevant grassroots trade unions will hold short-term amateur study classes to train the working backbone of each union group within their units. Relevant grassroots trade unions will establish labor insurance committees and fund review committees before the end of March, and will complete the registration of all employees within their units who are entitled to labor insurance benefits before April 20th. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has also instructed relevant grassroots trade unions to urge the administrations or capitalists of their respective units to strengthen medical facilities and to report the casualties, illnesses, and births of employees in their respective units in 1950.
    From March 1st to 10th, 566 units in Shanghai have received application registration forms from the Labor Bureau for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations. The Labor Bureau is working hard to complete this registration work before March 15th. The Public Treasury Department and its branches and service offices of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China have also universally collected labor insurance premiums paid by approved and registered units since March 10th.

　　上海准备实施劳动保险
    上海总工会等正积极进行实施劳动保险条例的各项准备工作。上海总工会于本月七日曾召集全市准备实行劳动保险条例各单位的工会主席及劳保干部开会。具体布置了这一准备工作。现各有关基层工会，正在开始对职工展开宣传教育。全市劳动保险干部训练班定三月十五日开学，各产业工会及有关基层工会的劳动保险干部将有七百余人参加学习。该训练班于三月底结束后，各有关基层工会将再分别举行短期的业余学习班，以培养本单位中各工会小组的工作骨干。各有关基层工会，将在三月底以前分别成立劳动保险委员会及经费审核委员会，并将在四月二十日以前全部完成本单位内应享受劳动保险待遇的职工的登记工作。上海总工会还责成各有关基层工会，督促各该单位行政或资方加强医务设备，并将各该单位职工在一九五零年中的伤亡、疾病、生育等情况上报。
    自三月一日至十日止，上海全市已有五百六十六个单位向劳动局领取实行劳动保险条例的申请登记书。劳动局正努力争取在三月十五日以前全部完成此项登记工作。中国人民银行上海分行所属公库部及各办事处、服务处，亦自三月十日起，普遍代收已核准登记单位所缴纳的劳动保险金。
