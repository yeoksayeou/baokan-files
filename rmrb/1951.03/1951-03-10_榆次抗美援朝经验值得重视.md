　　The Yuci Anti-American and Aid-Korea Experience Deserves Attention
　　Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
　　The great patriotic Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement has spurred the work of Yuci County, Shanxi Province, increasing the political enthusiasm of cadres and the masses a hundredfold, and demonstrating a new dynamism in all areas of work. The Anti-American and Aid-Korea appeals of the democratic parties concentrated the common interests of the people. The people of Yuci put it well: if we don't resist America and aid Korea, then "the American imperialists will come in, the Second War Zone will return, the landlords will rise up, and the common people will suffer."
　　The Yuci County Party Committee successfully grasped the common demands of the masses and elevated them to the level of Party policy. They systematically carried out the Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda movement, mobilizing the masses to denounce all the crimes committed against the people by American and Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, while at the same time comparing life before and after liberation, clearly delineating the ideological boundaries between the masses and the enemy, igniting the people's hatred for the enemy and their desire for revenge, and also awakening the people's deep love for the motherland and for life after liberation. On this ideological basis, the Yuci County Party Committee consciously guided the movement to combine with practical work. Under the slogan of political struggle, they mobilized cadres and the masses to rise up and participate in production, pay public grain, establish militia, and other tasks. This made the mass Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement a driving force for all work, and a decisive factor that constantly played a role in transforming Yuci County.
　　There are still many places that have not universally launched the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement. Comrades in these places often treat Anti-American and Aid-Korea merely as a matter of holding meetings, parades, and demonstrations for a while, which is completely wrong. The Yuci experience proves that the leadership strength of the Party organization lies in being able to ideologically mobilize the masses through the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement, systematically forming a conscious mass movement, and relying on the power of the masses to deeply instill the patriotic Anti-American and Aid-Korea ideology into the hearts of every person, so as to raise the people's awareness and thereby promote the development of all work.
　　Of course, the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement in Yuci should be further deepened. As of January, the number of people mobilized in the county only accounted for 45 percent of the total population. We await reports of their in-depth movement experience. At the same time, we welcome Party committees across the country to publish the situation and experience of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement under their leadership in this newspaper.

　　榆次抗美援朝经验值得重视
    中共山西省委会宣传部
    伟大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动推动了山西榆次县的工作，干部和群众政治积极性百倍提高，各项工作都表现了新的活跃。各民主党派的抗美援朝号召集中了人民共同利益。榆次人民说得好，不抗美援朝，便要：“美帝进来，二战区回来，地主起来，老百姓倒霉”。
    榆次县党委成功地抓住了群众的共同要求，并把它提高到党的政策水平。他们有步骤地进行了抗美援朝宣传运动，发动群众控诉美、日帝国主义和国民党反动派加在人民身上的一切罪行，同时进行解放前后的生活的对比，划清了群众敌我的思想界限，燃烧起人民仇恨敌人要求复仇的怒火，同时也唤起人民对祖国，对解放后的生活的亲切的热爱。在这一思想基础上，榆次县党委有意识地引导运动同实际工作结合，他们在政治斗争口号下，动员干部和群众奋起参加生产，缴公粮，建立民兵等项工作。使抗美援朝的群众运动成了一切工作的推动力。成为在转变榆次县工作中经常起作用的决定因素。
    现在还有很多地方没有普遍地掀起抗美援朝运动，这些地方的同志常常把抗美援朝只当作是开会游行示威热闹一阵了事，这是完全错误的。榆次经验证明：党组织的领导力量，就在于能通过抗美援朝运动从思想上发动群众。有步骤地形成群众自觉的运动，依靠群众的力量把抗美援朝爱国主义思想深入到每一个人心上，以提高人民的觉悟，从而推动一切工作的开展。
    当然，榆次的抗美援朝运动还应进一步深入。截至一月份为止，该县发动的人数只占全县人口百分之四十五。我们等待着他们深入运动经验的报道，同时，我们欢迎全国各地党委都将所领导的抗美援朝运动的情况和经验在本报上发表。
