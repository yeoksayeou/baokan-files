　　Nearly Three Million Women in Southwest China Gloriously Join Farmers' Associations

The broad masses of rural women in Southwest China have been initially organized and have become an important force in social reform movements such as rent reduction and agricultural production.

According to incomplete statistics, women account for more than 2.8 million of the over 10 million Farmers' Association members in the entire region. In the North Sichuan Administrative Region, nearly one million women have joined the Farmers' Association. All 35 counties under the jurisdiction of this administrative region have held women's representative conferences and established preparatory committees for the Democratic Women's Federation. Other regions also have women's organizations in most areas. In the Xikang Province, which was liberated later, there are already 90,000 organized women, and more than 15,000 women have participated in self-defense forces.

In social reform movements such as rent reduction, peasant women who had suffered cruel feudal oppression have engaged in reasoning and legal struggles with landlords. When fighting against the local tyrant Zhou Shiqing in Jilin Village, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, more than 30 women accused Zhou Shiqing. In Huayang County, West Sichuan Administrative Region, there were 420 women's groups that participated in propaganda, investigation, and the recovery of rent reduction fruits during the rent reduction movement. The county now has 80 women's armed groups, totaling 12,000 people. They stand guard, monitor the activities of illegal landlords, and defend their victorious achievements.

In the production movement, approximately more than half of the total number of women in the West Sichuan Administrative Region participate in agricultural and sideline production. In Langzhong County, North Sichuan Administrative Region, four women were selected as representatives to attend the North Sichuan Administrative Region Labor Model Conference. Wu Erniang, a woman from Songbai Township, Changshou County, East Sichuan Administrative Region, sold the fruits of rent reduction, bought four hoes and fifteen loads of manure, and deposited the remaining money in the People's Bank, preparing to invest it in production during the spring plowing season.

Rural women in various places actively assisted the troops in suppressing bandits. Gao Mousao, from Jiayong Township, Neijiang County, South Sichuan Administrative Region, organized women and children in the township to assist the troops in suppressing bandits when bandits were rampant last year, forcing more than 400 bandits to surrender and seizing more than 300 guns. Ren Shuzhen, the female township head of Xiaolian Township, Ya'an County, Xikang, led the self-defense team through thirty miles of snowy mountains and captured Li Mingkang, the notorious local bandit leader.

As rural women in various places actively participated in various social activities, their social status has also significantly changed. Many women have been elected to power organs by the masses. In the rural power organs of the North Sichuan Administrative Region, there are three female district heads, one hundred and fifty-four female township heads and village heads. In the West Sichuan Administrative Region, more than 16,900 women have been elected as Farmers' Association cadres. Yang Shujun, a women's representative from Wangjia Township, Jiangbei County, East Sichuan Administrative Region, wrote to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily: "We can work and manage everyone's affairs. We are no longer looked down upon. In the land reform, we will participate in the major event of land distribution alongside men." (Xinhua News Agency) (Picture attached)

　　西南近三百万妇女光荣参加农民协会
    西南广大农村妇女，已初步组织起来，并成为减租等社会改革运动和农业生产中的重要力量。
    据不完全统计：在全区一千万以上的农民协会会员中，妇女即占二百八十余万人。川北行政区有近百万妇女加入了农民协会，该行政区所属三十五个县都召开过妇女代表会议，并成立了民主妇女联合会筹备委员会。其他各地区也大都有了妇女组织。解放较晚的西康省，有组织的妇女也已达九万人，并有一万五千多个妇女参加了自卫队。
    在减租等社会改革运动中，遭受过残酷的封建压迫的农妇们，向地主进行了说理、说法斗争。贵州省贵筑县吉林村斗争恶霸周世卿时，控诉周世卿的妇女有三十多人。川西行政区华阳县有四百二十个妇女小组，在减租运动中参加了宣传、调查和追收减租果实等工作。该县现有八十个妇女武装小组，共一万二千人。她们站岗放哨，监视不法地主的活动，保卫自己的胜利果实。
    在生产运动中，川西行政区参加农业、副业生产的妇女约占全区妇女总数一半以上。川北行政区阆中县有四名妇女被选为出席川北行政区劳动模范大会的代表。川东行政区长寿县松柏乡妇女邬二娘把减租果实卖了，买进四把锄头、十五挑大粪，并将余款存在人民银行准备在春耕时投入生产。
    各地农妇并积极协助部队剿匪。川南行政区内江县贾永乡高么嫂在去年匪势猖獗时，组织该乡妇女和儿童协助部队剿匪，迫使四百多名土匪投降，并缴枪三百多枝。西康雅安县孝廉乡女乡长任淑贞带领自卫队经过三十里的雪山，活捉了当地罪恶昭彰的匪首李明康。
    由于各地农妇积极地参加了各项社会活动，她们的社会地位也已经显著地改变了。不少妇女被群众选入政权机关。在川北行政区的农村政权中，有三个妇女区长，一百五十四个女乡长和女村长。川西行政区有一万六千九百多名妇女被选为农民协会干部。川东行政区江北县王家乡妇女代表杨淑君投书给重庆新华日报说：“我们能劳动，也能管理大家的事。我们已不再受人轻视。在土地改革中，我们将和男子并肩参加分田的大事”。（新华社）（附图片）
