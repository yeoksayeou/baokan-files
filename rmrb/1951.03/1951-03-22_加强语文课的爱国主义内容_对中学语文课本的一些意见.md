Strengthening the Patriotic Content of Chinese Language Classes
    ——Some Opinions on Middle School Chinese Textbooks
    Jiang Shanye
    This article refers to the following two sets of Chinese textbooks:
    I. Junior Middle School Chinese Textbook Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6
    Edited by Song Yunbin et al., published by Xinhua Bookstore, People's Education Press
    II. Senior Middle School Chinese Textbook Volumes 1 to 6
    Edited by Zhou Zumo et al., published by Xinhua Bookstore, People's Education Press
    For over a hundred years, imperialists and domestic reactionaries oppressed and slaughtered our people on Chinese soil, strangled the people's wisdom and culture, and created poverty and ignorance; then they turned around and said that China was backward, that we were no good at this or that.
    However, we finally defeated the imperialists and their running dogs and liberated our country. Facts have proved that our people are great, intelligent, brave, and hardworking. In these hundred years, how many inspiring heroic figures has our motherland produced! Our heroic people, generation after generation, have fought unyieldingly.
    It is the imperialists and their running dogs, the domestic reactionaries, who are barbaric.
    It is our motherland and our people who are heroic.
    We must tell all this to young people and children, so that they deeply understand that our motherland has always been lovable, and especially today, this new democratic motherland is even more lovable, so that they have deep feelings for every blade of grass and tree in the motherland, and will not allow imperialists and their running dogs to touch it again.
    We must educate our students with the spirit of patriotism. This set of Chinese textbooks has done some of this, but it is far from enough.
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    First, let's look at how this set of textbooks uses the heroic figures and creations in our motherland's history to educate students.
    The junior middle school textbook only has five articles related to historical figures: "Xuanzang's Journey to the West" (Volume 1), "Qu Yuan" (Volume 2), "Ximen Bao" (Volume 3), "Zhan Tianyou" (Volume 4), and "Non-Aggression" (Volume 6).
    The senior middle school textbook doesn't have a single one in the vernacular. In classical Chinese, there are nine articles related to historical figures: "Wang Dan," "Zou Ji Advises King Qi to Accept Advice," "Ballad of Mulan," "Three Anecdotes of Fan Zhongyan," "Biography of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru," and "You Meng."
    This is far from enough. The quantity is small, and the selection lacks a clear intention and plan. Just look at the titles and content listed above, and you will know that they are few and fragmented. Moreover, some of the above-mentioned articles are not all praising great historical figures; some are just short stories. The purpose of selecting these is definitely not all to cultivate patriotic enthusiasm and national pride.
    Our motherland's history has countless figures worthy of praise. Chairman Mao taught us long ago, saying:
    "In the history of the Chinese nation, mainly the Han nationality, there is a well-developed agriculture and handicraft industry, many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians, and military strategists, and rich cultural classics."
    He also said: "In the thousands of years of history of the Chinese nation, many national heroes and revolutionary leaders, revolutionary military strategists, politicians, writers, and thinkers have emerged. Therefore, the Chinese nation is also a nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition and excellent historical heritage." (The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party)
    Educating young people with the great figures and events in our motherland's history is an indispensable part of patriotic education in cultivating national self-esteem. Neglecting this is inappropriate.
    Is it the case that because there is a history class, the Chinese language class can ignore this matter? No. The history class needs to be conducted systematically, and the Chinese language class must also be conducted. Because it can use vivid, image-rich, and soul-stirring descriptions to express a historical figure or a historical event. Just imagine, if all the content related to ancient and modern history were removed from the Chinese language class, how impoverished would the Chinese language class be? This is impossible.
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    Next, we need to talk about our motherland's cultural heritage, especially its literary heritage.
    We have a long history of culture and literary works that are no less impressive than those of any other country in the world. Our Chinese language class, at least in high school, should make a systematic introduction.
    Some of this is introduced in this set of textbooks. But it is still relatively fragmented. Taking poetry as an example, there are only seven poems by Bai Juyi and Du Fu combined, plus Su Shi's "Visiting Lanxi," which includes a short song of six lines, and a "Ballad of Mulan." How many great poets are there in our history, and how many beautiful poems have they created! If only a few articles are selected like this, in the future, only university literature students or experts will know that our motherland's history originally had so many poets.
    Of course, it is difficult to introduce our motherland's literary heritage to middle school students today. First, there has not yet been time to evaluate these historical figures and works with a correct historical perspective. Second, there are difficulties in teaching classical Chinese. But, difficulties should and can be overcome. We need to properly re-study our motherland's history, especially its literary history. Then, through introduction, retelling, or other appropriate methods, we can make students understand and love our motherland's literature.
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    Now, we want to talk about our motherland's nature.
    Chairman Mao wrote:
    "Our China is one of the largest countries in the world, its territory exceeding the area of ​​the entire Europe. On this vast territory, there are vast fertile fields, giving us the source of food and clothing; there are large and small mountains, plateaus, and plains across the country, giving us a large growth of forests, storing rich mineral resources; there are many rivers and lakes, giving us the benefit of boats and irrigation; there is a long coastline, giving us the convenience of communication with overseas ethnic groups. From very ancient times, the ancestors of our Chinese nation have labored, lived, and multiplied on this vast land."
    Every time we think of the vastness of our motherland, and of the magnificent buildings left behind by our ancestors on this vast land, how excited we are! Loving the motherland is inseparable from loving the land on which our ancestors have labored, lived, and multiplied for thousands of years.
    However, there are too few such teaching materials selected in the Chinese language class. There are only a few articles such as "The Yellow River" (Junior Middle School Volume 1, which is still a narrative), "Diary of a Visit to Yandang Mountain," and "Notes on the Shiku Temple in Wuzhou, Datong" (Senior Middle School Volume 4). Even in other articles, there are not many such passages.
    It's not just that the quantity is small, but the content of these few articles is far from enough to express the greatness of our motherland's mountains and rivers, and some even carry sorrowful emotions. For example, the last sentence of "Diary of a Visit to Yandang Mountain" is: "I see the clouds and rain on the four mountains are bleak, and I cannot help but worry about tomorrow." The last few sentences of "Breaking Ice on the Yellow River" (Junior Middle School Volume 1) also write: "Old Can, facing the scenery of snow and moonlight, thought of Xie Lingyun's poem, 'The bright moon shines on the accumulated snow, the north wind moves and is sad,' if you have not experienced the bitter cold of the north, how would you know that the word 'sad' in 'the north wind moves and is sad' is so well used?" It is inappropriate to use such places without criticism. We must cultivate majestic, heroic, and vigorous emotions through articles praising the nature of our motherland. But some vulgar and boring landscape writing is meaningless.
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    Then, if we say that there are too few teaching materials praising the historical figures and the nature of our motherland in the Chinese language textbook, is it a good choice to praise the teaching materials of our new country? Quite a few have been selected, and some are very good, but still not enough.
    First, let's take a look at the articles praising our great leader Chairman Mao. On this theme, there are only two in junior high school: "Chairman Mao and the Workers" (Volume 1) and "Chairman Mao's Youth" (Volume 2). There is also an article about "Chairman Mao's Words" (Volume 4). What about high school? There is not a single one. It may be that the editors selected a few articles by Chairman Mao, and felt that through these to educate students to understand Chairman Mao's thought and Chairman Mao's greatness, there is no need to select other articles praising Chairman Mao. However, this reason is obviously insufficient.
    Chairman Mao is the greatest and most outstanding leader of our motherland. Leaving aside or ignoring the cultivation of students' high love for Chairman Mao to carry out patriotic education is soulless patriotic education. Treating this content on par with other content is also wrong.
    Of course, cultivating students' love for our great leader Chairman Mao is not done only through one course or a few articles, nor can it be done alone by one course or a few articles. Precisely because of this, we should strengthen it from all aspects, and the Chinese language class should strengthen it even more.
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    Then, let's take a look at the other aspects of teaching materials praising our new country.
    Generally speaking, all articles that write about new people and new things are praising our new country. For example, writing about the People's Liberation Army, writing about land reform, writing about labor production, etc., these themes are all related to patriotism. But the problem is that not all of these articles can inspire patriotic enthusiasm.
    There are many such articles in the textbook, some of which are better, such as some stories of the War of Resistance Against Japan or the War of Liberation, such as "A Record of the Voluntary Labor of Beijing Youth" (Junior Middle School Volume 3) and "A Visit to Tongbei Farm" (Junior Middle School Volume 6), which can all inspire patriotic enthusiasm.
    In addition, there are also some that are not good. For example, the last lesson of Junior Middle School Volume 6, "The Masses Are There," the theme is to criticize young students' poor mass viewpoint. But it uses most of the space to describe the "dirtiness" of the peasants and the "dislike of dirt" of the young students; and the positive portrayal of the peasants' diligence, bravery, and other excellent qualities is not enough. In this way, it will not be able to vigorously praise our great motherland and people, and inspire deep love; on the contrary, it will have a bad effect.
    This is also one of the reasons why the textbooks have selected many articles about new people and new things, but still cannot run through the full spirit of loving the motherland.
    Secondly, there are few articles that positively and explicitly take praising our new country as the theme, such as Feng Zhi's "Moscow" (Senior Middle School Volume 2) that write about our new country. There is one article "In New China" written by Dubrovinina.
    At the time of the birth of the People's Republic of China, and in the year since then, there have been many works that warmly praised the beginning of this great historical era and the victory of the Chinese people. For example, if one or two such works could be selected after Chairman Mao's "Opening Speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" in the first volume of high school, how good would it be!
              ×            ×            ×            ×
    The above is what I think are some of the missing contents in the Chinese language textbook.
    In addition to this, what other shortcomings are there? Also, there are too many translated articles and articles describing foreign things. Seriously, like Junior Middle School Volume 6, there are a total of twenty lessons, half of which are translated articles and articles describing foreign things (six translated articles, accounting for about one-third of the whole textbook).
    For example, in Senior Middle School Volume 5, six of the nine vernacular articles are translated articles and articles about foreign things (four translated articles).
    It can also be seen that the content that powerfully expresses the deep love for our great motherland is insufficient.
    This is a bias, it is not that there are too few things to write about in our motherland and people who can write good articles.
    This is not to say that we oppose translated articles in general, oppose introducing and praising the articles of our great friend and mentor, the Soviet Union, and oppose exposing the brutality and corruption of American imperialism. Carrying out patriotic education must be combined with internationalist education, otherwise it is wrong. The other side of carrying out patriotic education is to cultivate hatred for the enemies of the motherland—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—especially contempt, disdain, and scorn for American imperialism. However, the proportion of various articles should be properly handled. Our Chinese language class should focus on positively depicting the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, so that this content runs through the entire textbook.
            ×              ×              ×              ×
    In summary, this set of textbooks, as written in its editorial outline, still attaches importance to political and ideological education and contains patriotic content. However, this kind of education is not just a matter of selecting a few articles to form a unit; but to make the spirit of loving the motherland run through the entire textbook like a red line.
    This point is not clear enough in the editing.
    Will this make the content monotonous? Absolutely not. On the contrary, it will make the content truly rich. Loving the motherland will never be monotonous. Loving the motherland can be expressed in various ways.
    Then, will the style of writing be restricted? No. Expository writing, argumentative writing, narrative writing, lyrical writing, landscape writing, poetry, novels, dramas, etc., can all express patriotic content.

　　加强语文课的爱国主义内容
    ——对中学语文课本的一些意见
    江山野
    本文是就下列两部语文课本来说的：
    一、初级中学语文课本第一、二、三、四、六册
    宋云彬等编、新华书店、人民教育出版社出版
    二、高级中学语文课本第一至六册
    周祖谟等编、新华书店、人民教育出版社出版
    一百多年来，帝国主义和国内反动派在中国的土地上压迫和屠杀我们的人民，绞杀人民的智慧和文化，制造贫穷和愚昧；又反过头来说中国是落后的，说我们这也不行那也不行。
    但是，我们终于战胜了帝国主义者及其走狗，解放了我们的国土。事实证明了我们的人民是伟大、智慧、勇敢而勤劳的。这一百多年来，我们祖国不知产生了多少可歌可泣的英雄人物啊！我们英雄的人民，一代继承一代，始终不屈不挠地战斗着。
    野蛮的是帝国主义者及其走狗国内反动派。
    英雄的是我们的祖国和人民。
    我们一定要将这些告诉青年和孩子们，让他们深深懂得我们的祖国从来就是可爱的，特别在今天这个新民主主义的祖国是更加令人可爱了，使他们对祖国的一草一木都具有深厚的感情，不许帝国主义者及其走狗再来动一动。
    我们一定要以爱国主义的精神教育我们的学生。这一套语文课本是做了一些，但却很不够。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    首先看一看这一套课本是怎样以祖国历史上的英雄人物及其创造来教育学生的呢？
    初中课本只有《玄奘的西游》（第一册）、《屈原》（第二册）、《西门豹》（第三册）、《詹天佑》（第四册）、《非攻》（第六册）五篇是有关历史人物的。
    高中课本的白话文里一篇也没有。文言文中有《王旦》、《邹忌讽齐王纳谏》、《木兰辞》、《范仲淹事三则》、《廉颇蔺相如列传》、《优孟》第九篇是有关历史人物的。
    这是很不够的，数量少，并且在选择上缺乏明确的意图和计划。看一看上列的题目和内容就知其少而零碎了。不仅如此，上列的一些文章并非都是歌颂历史上的伟大人物的，有些只是一些小故事。选择这些的目的也决不都是为了培养爱祖国的热情和民族自豪感。
    我们祖国的历史上有无数值得歌颂的人物，毛主席早就这样教导我们，说：
    “在中华民族主要是汉族的开化史上，有素称发达的农业和手工业，有许多伟大的思想家、科学家、发明家、政治家与军事家，有丰富的文化典籍。”
    又说：“在中华民族的几千年的历史中，产生了很多的民族英雄与革命领袖，产生了很多的革命军事家、政治家、文学家与思想家。所以中华民族又是一个有光荣革命传统和优秀历史遗产的民族。”（中国革命与中国共产党）
    以祖国历史上的伟大人物与事迹教育青年，是爱国主义教育中培养民族自尊心的不可缺少的部分。忽略这一点是不应当的。
    是不是有了历史课，语文课就可以不管这件事呢？不可以的。历史课需要有系统地来进行，语文课也必须进行。因为它可以用生动，形象，动人心灵的描述来表现一个历史人物或一件历史事迹。试想如果把所有有关古今历史的内容全从语文课中除掉，语文课将多么贫乏了呢？这是不可能的。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    进一步要谈到我们祖国的文化遗产，特别是文学遗产了。
    我们有悠久的文化，有比世界上那一国家也不逊色的文学作品。我们语文课，至少在高中，应作有系统的介绍。
    在这套课本中是介绍了一些的。但仍比较零碎。就以诗为例来说，只有白居易和杜甫两人的作品共计七首，另外还有苏轼的一篇游兰溪，其中有短歌六句，和一篇木兰词。我们历史上有多少伟大诗人，创造了多少美丽的诗歌啊！如果只这样选上几篇，将来就只有大学文学系学生或专家才知道我们祖国历史上原来还有这样许多诗人了。
    当然，今天向中学生介绍我们祖国的文学遗产是有困难的。第一是还没有来得及以正确的历史观点来评价这些历史人物和作品。其次就是文言文在进行教学上有困难。但，困难是应当并且可以克服的。我们需要好好的重新研究一下祖国的历史，特别是文学史。然后通过介绍、重述或其他适当的方法来使学生们懂得并且热爱我们祖国的文学。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    现在，我们要谈谈我们祖国的大自然了。
    毛主席这样写道：
    “我们中国是世界上最大国家之一，他的领土超过了整个欧洲的面积。在这个广大领土之上，有广大的肥田沃地，给我们以衣食之源；有纵横全国的大小山脉、大小高原、平原，给我们生长了广大的森林，贮藏了丰富的矿产；有很多的江河湖泽，给我们以舟楫与灌溉之利；有很长的海岸线，给我们以交通海外各民族的方便。从很早的古代起，我们中华民族的祖先就劳动、生息、繁殖在这块广大土地之上。”
    每一想到我们祖国的辽阔广大，想到在这辽阔广大的土地上，我们祖先遗留下无数雄伟的建筑，使我们多么兴奋啊！热爱祖国是和热爱我们祖先几千年来在上面劳动、生息、繁殖的土地分不开的。
    但是，语文课上这样的教材选得太少了。只有《黄河》（初中第一册，还是一篇记叙文）、《游雁宕山日记》、《记大同武州石窟寺》（高中第四册）等寥寥几篇。就是在其他文章中，这样的段落也不多。
    还不只是数量上少，这几篇的内容也远不能表现祖国山河的伟大，并且有的还带有哀伤的情感。比如《游雁宕山日记》的最后一句是：“余见四山云雨凄凄，不能不为明晨忧也。”《黄河上打冰》（初中第一册）最后几句也写道：“老残对着雪月交辉的景致，想起谢灵运的诗，‘明月照积雪，北风动且哀’两句，若非经历北方苦寒的景象，哪里知道‘北风动且哀’的‘哀’字下得好呢？”像这些地方没有批判地选用就不妥当了。我们要通过歌颂祖国大自然的文章来培养雄壮的豪迈的朝气勃勃的情感。但有些庸俗无聊的写景文是没有意义的。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    那么，如果说语文课本中编选的歌颂祖国历史人物和祖国大自然的教材太少了，是不是很好的选择了歌颂我们新的国家的教材了呢？是选了不少，其中也有些很好的，但还很不够。
    先看一看歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的文章吧。以此为主题的，在初中，只有两篇：《毛主席和工人》（第一册）、《毛泽东同志的青年时代》（第二册）。另外还有一篇是写《毛主席的话》的（第四册）。高中呢？就一篇都没有了。可能是编者因为选了几篇毛主席的文章，觉得通过这些来教育学生领会毛主席的思想和毛主席的伟大，就不必另外再选歌颂毛主席的文章了。但是，这理由显然是不充足的。
    毛主席是我们祖国最伟大最杰出的领袖。离开了或忽略了培养学生对毛主席的高度热爱，来进行爱国主义教育是没有灵魂的爱国主义教育。把这一内容和其他内容平列起来处理，也是错误的。
    当然，培养学生对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，不是只通过一种课程或几篇文章来进行，也不是一种课程或几篇文章所能够单独做到的。正因为如此，我们才应当从各方面来加强它，语文课也就更应加强它了。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    然后，再看一看歌颂我们新的国家的其他方面的教材吧。
    一般说，凡是写新人物、新事物的文章，都是歌颂我们新的国家的。比如写解放军，写土地改革，写劳动生产等等，这些主题都是和爱国主义有关的。但，问题是并不是所有这些文章都能激发爱祖国的热情。
    课本里这一类文章很多，有的比较好，如一些抗日战争或解放战争的故事，如《记北京青年的义务劳动》（初中第三册）《通北农场访问记》（初中第六册）等等，都能够激发爱祖国的热情。
    另外，则也有一些是不好的。如初中第六册的最后一课《群众在那里》，主题是批判青年学生的群众观点差。但它用了大半篇幅描写农民的“脏”，与青年学生的“嫌脏”；而正面表现农民的勤劳、勇敢和其他优秀品质是不够的。这样也就不能有力地歌颂我们伟大的祖国与人民，激发深刻的爱情；相反，到会有不好的作用。
    这也就是课本中虽然选了不少的写新人物新事物的文章，但还不能贯穿饱满的爱祖国的精神的原因之一。
    其次，正面的显明的以歌颂我们新的国家为主题的文章，如像冯至写《莫斯科》（高中第二册）那样写我们新的国家的文章是少的。有一篇《在新中国》是杜伯洛维娜写的。
    在中华人民共和国诞生的时候，以及这一年多以来，有不少热烈歌颂这一伟大历史时代的开端和中国人民的胜利的作品。比如，假若在高中第一册毛主席的《中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议开幕词》后面，能够选一两篇这样的作品是多么好啊！
              ×            ×            ×            ×
    以上，就是我觉得语文课本中所缺少的一些内容。
    除此以外，还有什么缺点呢？还有，就是翻译文章和描写国外事物的文章多了一些。严重的像初中第六册，一共有二十课，其中就有一半是翻译文章和描写国外事物的文章（翻译六篇，占全课本约三分之一）。
    再如高中第五册，九篇白话文中，就有六篇是翻译文章和写国外事物的文章（翻译占四篇）。
    从而也可见有力地表现我们伟大祖国深切可爱这方面的内容是不够的了。
    这是一个偏向，并不是我们祖国可写的事和写好文章的人太少。
    这不是说我们一概反对翻译文章，反对介绍与歌颂我们伟大的朋友和导师苏联的文章，反对暴露美帝国主义残暴和腐朽的文章。进行爱国主义教育必需与国际主义教育结合，否则就是错误的。进行爱国主义教育的另一面，是培养对祖国的敌人——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的仇恨，特别是对美帝国主义的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。但各种文章的比重应有适当的处理。我们的语文课应该以正面描写我们祖国的伟大可爱为中心，使这一内容贯穿在全部课本中间。
            ×              ×              ×              ×
    总起来说，这一套课本，正如其编辑大意中所写的，还是重视了政治思想教育的，有爱国主义的内容的。但是，这种教育不仅是选择几篇文章组成一个单元的问题；而是要使爱祖国的精神，像一条红线一样贯穿在整个课本之中。
    这一点，在编辑上是不够明确的。
    这样是不是会使内容单调了呢？绝对不会的。恰恰相反，到会使内容真正的丰富起来。爱祖国是永远不会单调的。爱祖国是可以从各方面表现的。
    那么，文章体裁是否会受到限制呢？不会的。说明文、议论文、记叙文、抒情文、写景文，诗歌、小说、戏剧等等都同样可以表现爱国主义的内容。
