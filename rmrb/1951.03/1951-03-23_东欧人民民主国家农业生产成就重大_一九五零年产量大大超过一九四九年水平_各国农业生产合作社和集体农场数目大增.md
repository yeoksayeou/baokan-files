Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, achieved significant success last year in developing agricultural production, promoting agricultural mechanization, and carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The agricultural production of all People's Democratic countries in 1950 greatly exceeded the levels of 1949. Poland's total agricultural production increased by 13 percent, crop production increased by 6 percent, and livestock increased by 24 percent. Cultivated land area reached 15.18 million hectares, an increase of 2.5 percent compared to 1949. Czechoslovakia's agricultural production increased by 14 percent compared to 1949, with harvests of wheat, oats, flax, rye, sugar beets, and hemp reaching or exceeding the levels stipulated for 1953 in the Five-Year Plan. Various products of the livestock breeding industry also approached or exceeded the 1953 levels. Hungary's grain harvest increased by 9.2 percent compared to 1949, and the number of livestock also increased significantly. Romania's output of major crops exceeded that of 1949, and the number of various livestock on state farms increased by 21 to 48 percent. Bulgaria's output of wheat, rye, rice, cotton, and tobacco increased by 10 to 30 percent compared to 1949. Albania's crop planting area in 1950 increased by 3 percent compared to 1949, potato production increased by 36 percent, and cotton production increased fourteenfold.

The mechanization of agriculture in various countries has developed significantly. In 1950, Polish machine tractor stations had 38 percent more tractors than in 1949, 96 percent more combine harvesters, and 24 percent more machines used by cooperatives' machine and tractor stations. The number of tractors in Czechoslovakia increased by 8 percent compared to 1949, harvesters and balers increased by 6 percent, and combine harvesters increased by 21 percent. Hungary added 3,171 tractors and 390 threshing machines in 1950. Bulgaria established seven new machine and tractor stations in 1950, bringing the total to ninety-five. Romania had 138 agricultural machine stations in 1950, 30 of which were established after May 1950.

In 1950, the number of agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms in various countries greatly increased. Large numbers of poor and middle peasants joined production cooperatives. Poland's agricultural cooperatives increased more than ninefold in one year, totaling 2,200. Agricultural cooperatives and state farms now own 13 percent of the country's cultivated land. Czechoslovakia has one agricultural cooperative or cooperative preparatory committee for every two villages, and one advanced agricultural cooperative for every four villages. Cooperative farmland has exceeded one million hectares, and together with state farms, accounts for more than 22 percent of the country's cultivated land area. Hungary's socialist agricultural sector now owns 13.1 percent of the country's arable land, a twofold increase compared to 1949. By October 1950, Bulgaria had 2,562 agricultural cooperatives nationwide, uniting more than 525,000 farm households, accounting for 48 percent of the country's farm households; the land owned by cooperatives accounted for 43.6 percent of the country's arable land. In 1949, Romania had only 56 collective farms, but by the end of 1950, it had more than 1,000. Albania's socialist agricultural sector accounted for 7 percent of the country's cultivated land at the end of last year.

This year, the People's Democratic countries will further increase agricultural production. Poland's agricultural production is expected to increase by 10 percent, the output of Hungary's state farms and agricultural production cooperatives will double, Romania plans to establish fifty machine and tractor stations this year, and Bulgaria's agricultural production will increase by 44 percent.

    各国农业生产合作社和集体农场数目大增
    【新华社二十二日讯】东欧的波、捷、匈、罗、保和阿尔巴尼亚等人民民主国家，去年在发展农业生产、促进农业机械化和进行农业的社会主义改造等方面，获得了重大的成就。
    各人民民主国家一九五○年的农业生产都已大大超过了一九四九年的水平。波兰农业生产总量增加了百分之十三，农作物增产百分之六，牲畜增加百分之二十四。耕地面积已达一千五百一十八万公顷，比一九四九年增加了百分之二点五。捷克斯洛伐克农业生产量比一九四九年增加了百分之十四，小麦、燕麦、亚麻及裸麦、甜菜和大麻等的收获量，已达到或超过五年计划为一九五三年规定的水平。牲畜饲养业的各种产品也接近或超过了一九五三年的水平。匈牙利的谷物收获量比一九四九年增加了百分之九点二，牲畜头数也有显著增加。罗马尼亚主要农作物的产量都超过一九四九年，国营农场的各种牲畜数量增加了百分之二十一到四十八。保加利亚的小麦、裸麦、稻谷、棉花、烟草的产量，比一九四九年增加了百分之十到百分之三十。阿尔巴尼亚一九五○年农作物播种面积比一九四九年增加百分之三，马铃薯产量增加百分之三十六，棉花产量增加十四倍。
    各国农业的机械化已有显著发展。一九五○年波兰的机器拖拉机站拥有的拖拉机比一九四九年增加了百分之三十八，联合机增加了百分之九十六，合作社的机器与拖拉机站使用的机器增加了百分之二十四。捷克斯洛伐克拖拉机的数目比一九四九年增加了百分之八，收获机和捆扎机增加百分之六，联合机增加百分之二十一。匈牙利在一九五○年增加了三千一百七十一辆拖拉机，三百九十台打谷机。保加利亚一九五○年新成立了七个机器和拖拉机站，总数已增至九十五个。罗马尼亚一九五○年已有农业机器站一百三十八处，其中三十处是在一九五○年五月以后建立的。
    一九五○年各国的农业生产合作社和集体农场的数目大为增加。成批的贫农和中农参加了生产合作社。波兰的农业合作社在一年内增加了九倍以上，总数达二千二百个。农业合作社与国营农场已拥有全国耕地的百分之十三。捷克斯洛伐克每两个村庄便有一个农业合作社或合作社筹备会，每四个村庄有一个高级的农业合作社。合作社耕地已超过一百万公顷，加上国营农场占全国耕地面积百分之二十二以上。匈牙利的社会主义农业部分已拥有全国可耕地的百分之十三点一，比一九四九年增加一倍。保加利亚到一九五○年十月为止，全国已有二千五百六十二个农业合作社，团结了五十二万五千多农户，占全国农户百分之四十八；合作社拥有的耕地占全国可耕地百分之四十三点六。罗马尼亚在一九四九年时只有五十六个集体农场，到一九五○年底已有一千多个。阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义农业部分在去年年底占全国耕地的百分之七。
    今年，各人民民主国家将进一步增加农业生产。波兰的农业生产预计增加百分之十，匈牙利的国营农场和农业生产合作社的生产量将增加一倍，罗马尼亚计划在今年建立五十个机器与拖拉机站，保加利亚的农业生产将增加百分之四十四。
