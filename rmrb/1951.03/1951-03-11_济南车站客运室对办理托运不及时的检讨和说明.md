Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

To the Editor:

After reading Comrade Ma Yushan's opinion in the "Reader's Letters" column of your newspaper on February 16th, "Jinan Railway Administration Jinan Station Should Improve Cargo Consignment Procedures," we express our sincere gratitude for Comrade Ma's concern and care for our station. The actual situation of our station is briefly explained as follows:

(1) Our station handles passenger consignment of parcels, and when there are fewer goods, they are accepted and inspected upon arrival. However, due to the small size of the parcel room at our station, the only storage location is a section of the platform within the station. If the goods under the platform are full, the subsequent goods cannot be immediately weighed and inspected.

(2) There are only four trains going north from our station every day. Three of them pass through our station. Each train has a maximum stop time of fifteen minutes at our station. During the stop time, the goods must be unloaded first and then loaded. Therefore, the amount unloaded each time is not large, and the amount loaded is not large either. Especially during the Spring Festival, the cargo transportation business is busy, and the amount of consignment goods that our station can accept is even less. The situation mentioned by Comrade Ma Yushan occurred on January 25th, which was around the Spring Festival. At that time, there were the most consignment packages, and the baggage cars of each train were often full. Our station did not have spare baggage cars to add, so a consignment congestion occurred. Although we have used freight cars to transport goods instead of baggage cars several times, this method can only be used when there are enough packages to fill an entire car, otherwise it is a waste of vehicles.

(3) Regarding the staff's meal time. The system at our station is that all on-duty personnel use their spare time to eat at the station. From 5:10 PM to 6:15 PM on January 25th, our station did not handle consignment procedures because some people changed shifts to go to the cafeteria for meals, and some people went outside to load trains Nos. 111 and 112 bound for Harbin.

The untimely handling of consignments at our station this time, failing to receive goods upon arrival and wasting the consignor's time, although there are the above-mentioned objective reasons, we did not think of ways to overcome them, nor did we explain it well to the passengers. This shows that there are many shortcomings in our work, which deserve our self-criticism. In the future, in addition to suggesting that the Railway Bureau frequently set up spare baggage cars at our station for use when the consignment business is busy, we will try our best to use covered wagons for transportation, and often explain the consignment situation to the consignors to avoid wasting their time. The service spirit of our station staff is far inferior to that of Beijing Station. In addition to strengthening our study and learning from Beijing Station and other stations, we also hope that all passengers will frequently provide opinions to our station to help us overcome our shortcomings, so as to better serve the people.

### 济南车站客运室对办理托运不及时的检讨和说明

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    济南车站客运室对办理托运不及时的检讨和说明编辑同志：
    读了贵报二月十六日《读者来信》栏马玉山同志对《济南铁路管理局济南车站应改善货物托运手续》的意见后，我们对马同志对本站的关心与爱护表示万分感激。兹将本站实际情况简略说明如下：
    （一）本站办理旅客托运包裹，在货件较少时是随到随验收的。但由于本站包裹房狭小，唯一的堆货地点只有站内一段雨棚。如雨棚内的货件装满了，后来的货件便无法立时过磅验收。
    （二）从本站北去列车，每天只有四趟。其中三趟是从本站经过的。每趟车在本站停站时间最长为十五分钟。在停站时间内必须先行卸货，然后再装货。所以每次卸的不多，装的也不多。特别是在春节期间，货运业务繁忙，本站能够收的托运货物就更少了。马玉山同志所谈的情况是发生在一月二十五日，正是春节前后。那时托运包件最多，各列车的行李车是经常满载的。我们站内又无备用行李车可以加挂，因而发生托运拥挤现象。虽然我们曾利用货车代替行李车装运数次，但这种办法必须包裹够一整车时方可采用，否则又浪费车辆。
    （三）关于工作人员的吃饭时间问题。本站的制度是凡值班人员全部利用空余时间在车站吃饭。一月二十五日下午五点十分至六点十五分的时间，本站没有办理托运手续，是由于一部分人换班到食堂吃饭，一部分人到外面装一一二次开往哈尔滨的列车。
    此次我站办理托运不及时，没有做到随到随收，浪费托运人时间，虽然有上述客观原因，但我们没有想办法去克服，也未向旅客很好地解释，这说明我们在工作中是存在着很多缺点，是值得我们检讨的。今后我们除建议路局经常在本站设立备用行李车，以供托运业务繁忙时随时加挂外，我们将尽量利用篷车疏运，并经常把托运情况向托运人解释，以免浪费他们的时间。本站工作人员服务精神远不如北京站这一点，我们除了加强学习，向北京站和其他站看齐外，并希望各位旅客经常地对本站提出意见，帮助我们克服缺点，以便更好地为人民服务。
