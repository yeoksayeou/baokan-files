　　Volunteer Army Homecoming Representatives Write to Frontline Commanders and Soldiers
    People Throughout the Motherland Praise the Volunteer Army
    [Our Newspaper] Chinese People's Volunteer Army homecoming representatives Chai Chuanruo and others have recently gone to various parts of the country to report on the heroic battles of our People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front, in order to further promote the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Before leaving Beijing, they wrote a letter to the leaders and all commanders and soldiers of the Volunteer Army on the Korean front, reporting on their work in Beijing and the love and gratitude of people from all walks of life in the capital towards the Volunteer Army. The original letter is as follows:
To the leaders of the Volunteer Army and all commanders and soldiers:
    After arriving in Beijing, from February 2nd to 28th, we have made 45 reports to central government agencies, democratic parties, people's organizations, cultural circles, business and industry, religious circles, and workers, students, children, etc., with an audience of over 100,000 people.
    After listening to our reports, Comrade Liu Yingyuan, a national special-class labor hero, specially sent us his own photo to express his respect; the workers of Mentougou automatically proposed that "the factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon, one more can of coal produced is equivalent to killing one more American beast soldier, and carry out the patriotic production competition with the spirit of the Volunteer Army bravely killing the enemy"; Mr. Shen Junru was moved to tears and held Comrade Chai Chuanruo's hand tightly for four or five minutes; Mr. Ma Yinchu, an economist who returned from Poland last December, told us that when he attended the World Peace Congress in Warsaw, when the news of the liberation of Pyongyang reached the venue, more than 3,000 representatives from more than 80 countries immediately cheered "Long Live Mao Zedong" to the Chinese delegation and applauded enthusiastically for as long as fifteen minutes; students from the Third District of Beijing, upon hearing that the front lacked cultural nourishment, immediately raised and donated more than 1,300 books, magazines, picture albums, etc.; Soviet friend Elira (female) delivered a eulogy to the Volunteer Army; Romanian male and female students (at Tsinghua University), in order to express their gratitude for the victory of the Volunteer Army, warmly embraced and kissed Comrade Ji Bingqian and sent more than 100 international commemorative badges; after listening to the report, a staff member of the Second Cultural Center of Beijing wrote twelve letters of comfort to combat heroes Zhou Degao, Luo Liangshi, etc. overnight; in addition to giving their precious red scarves to the Volunteer Army, the children's team members scrambled to offer us their beloved commemorative badges and school badges such as "Good Student" and "Learning Model", and in one report alone, they pinned 75 badges on Comrade Dou Shaoyi's chest; Wang Wenyi, a district cadre, sent a family photo to Comrade Chai Chuanruo, with the inscription on the photo: "My family's happy life is given by the Volunteer Army. I am a retained personnel, and I will transform myself well in the future to repay the Volunteer Army"; when a staff member of the People's Bank heard about the hard struggle on the front, he immediately took off the gloves he was wearing and asked Comrade Dong Lefu to bring them to the front....
    Now, all sectors of the capital are singing and praising the great victory and heroic combat stories of the Volunteer Army, and expressing unlimited love and gratitude to the Volunteer Army. This is the supreme glory of all our Volunteer Army comrades! At the same time, in order to cooperate with the victory on the front, the people of the motherland have resolutely expressed their determination to be the backing of the Volunteer Army in the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland. The worker brothers have launched a patriotic production competition; the farmers guarantee to hand in good grain and plant the land well; the students are stepping up their studies; the businessmen have signed patriotic covenants one after another, paying taxes in advance and exceeding the original amount; the religious circles have also participated in political activities and taken to the streets to demonstrate... In short, the people of the whole country have entered the patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland!
    Accepting the warm invitations of major cities, we will immediately take trains or planes to all parts of the country to introduce the heroic combat situation of the Volunteer Army through broadcasting, reports, seminars, etc., in order to deepen the propaganda of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The victory of the Volunteer Army and the names of the heroes will spread throughout China and throughout the world!
    Finally, let us wish the leaders and all comrades of the Volunteer Army to create more glorious and greater victories on the existing honor. Together with the people of the motherland, the people of Korea, and the people of the world, we will fight to the end to finally eliminate the American aggressors!
        With the highest revolutionary salute!
                                        Chai Chuanruo  Ji Bingqian  Dong Lefu
                                          Li Weiying  Zhang Fu  Dou Shaoyi
                                                  February 28th

    祖国人民到处赞颂志愿军
    【本报讯】中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若等，已于日前分赴全国各地报告我人民志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇战斗情形，以深入开展抗美援朝运动。他们在离京前，曾写信给朝鲜前线志愿军首长及全体指战员，报告在京工作情况及首都各界人民对志愿军的热爱和感激的情形。原信如下：志愿军首长并转全体指战员同志们：
    我们到达北京后，从二月二日到二十八日，已向中央各机关、各民主党派、各人民团体、文化界、工商界、宗教界及工人、学生、儿童等作了四十五次报告，听众约十万余人。
    听了我们的报告以后，全国特等劳动英雄刘英源同志，特以自己的照片送给我们，表示敬意；门头沟工人自动地提出了“工场就是战场，机器就是武器，多出一罐煤就等于多打死一个美国兽兵，以志愿军英勇杀敌的精神开展爱国主义生产竞赛”；沈钧儒老先生感动的热泪盈眶，把柴川若同志的手紧紧地握了四、五分钟之久；去年十二月由波兰回国的经济学者马寅初先生告诉我们：他在华沙出席世界保卫和平大会，当解放平壤的捷报传到会场时，八十多个国家的三千多名代表，立即向中国代表团欢呼“毛泽东万岁”，并热烈鼓掌达十五分钟之久；北京三区学生听到了前方缺乏文化食粮时，当即募集捐送了书籍、杂志、画报等一千三百余本；苏联友人伊丽拉（女）向志愿军致颂辞；罗马尼亚男女留学生（在清华大学）为了表示感激志愿军的胜利，向嵇炳前同志热烈拥抱，接吻，并送国际纪念章百余枚；北京市第二文化馆一个职员听了报告后，一夜给战斗英雄周德高、罗良士等写了十二封慰问信；儿童队员除把自己宝贵的红领巾送给志愿军外，并将自己的“好学生”、“学习模范”等心爱的纪念章和校徽争先恐后地献给我们，在一次报告中即给窦少毅同志胸前挂了七十五个；区干部王文义把自己全家合摄的照片送给柴川若同志，照片上写着：“我一家人的幸福生活是志愿军给的。我是一个留用人员，今后要很好地改造自己，来报答志愿军”；人民银行一个职员听到前方艰苦奋斗的情况时，立即把自己手上带的手套脱下来，托董乐辅同志捎到前方去……。
    现在首都各界到处歌颂与赞扬着志愿军的伟大胜利与英勇作战故事，并对志愿军表示了无限的热爱与感激。这是我们全体志愿军同志的无尚光荣！同时，祖国人民为了配合前线的胜利，都坚决表示在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中做志愿军的后盾。工人弟兄们展开了爱国主义生产竞赛；农民们保证缴好粮、种好地；学生们正在加紧学习；商人们纷纷订立爱国公约，提前纳税并超过了原定数目；宗教界也参加了政治活动到街头示威……总之，全国人民都已进入了抗美援朝保家卫国爱国主义的运动！
    接受各大城市热烈的邀请，我们将立即乘火车或飞机到全国各地，以广播、报告、座谈等方式，介绍志愿军英勇战斗情形，以深入抗美援朝的宣传。志愿军的胜利和英雄们的名字将传遍全中国，传遍全世界！
    最后让我们预祝志愿军首长和全体同志们在现有的荣誉上创造更辉煌更伟大的胜利。和祖国人民，朝鲜人民，全世界人民在一起，为最后消灭美国侵略者而奋斗到底！
        此致崇高的革命敬礼！

                                                  二月二十八日
