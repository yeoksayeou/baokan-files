Avenging the Martyred Heroes
    Xikang Provincial Government Executes Special Agent Yang Qiushan

Yang Qiushan, one of the murderers who plotted to kill General Yang Hucheng and his family, the deputy warden of the Chongqing "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" General Guardhouse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and a well-known executioner of the Kuomintang secret service, was captured in Xichang County. He has been sentenced to death by the Xikang Provincial People's Government and executed in Ya'an on February 27.

Beginning in 1939, Yang was fostered by bandit leader Dai Li's Xifeng Training Class and the "Sino-American Cooperation Training Class." With his counter-revolutionary brutality, he became Chiang Kai-shek's bodyguard and Dai Li and Mao Renfeng's trusted henchman. He served for a long time as Chiang Kai-shek's guard group leader, the head of the Kuomintang secret service Chongqing Action Group, and the warden and deputy warden of the Chongqing "White Mansion" and "Zhazidong" detention centers of the Chiang bandit and U.S. imperialist large-scale counter-revolutionary organization, the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." He personally murdered more than one hundred democratic figures. In August 1949, he collectively murdered more than sixty patriotic revolutionaries with machine guns at the "White Mansion" in one go. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, this bandit personally went to Guiyang to kidnap General Yang Hucheng to the Chongqing "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," where he guarded him. During the Chongqing massacre, he murdered General Yang's family and instructed his accomplices to shoot and kill General Yang Hucheng. After the liberation of Chongqing, this bandit sneaked into Xichang County, Xikang Province, and colluded with Tan Rongzhang, the chief of the Kuomintang secret service Xichang Inspection Office, to plot the assassination of Wu Peiying, the commander of the 136th Division of the Kuomintang 24th Army, who was preparing to revolt. When Commander Wu revolted, this bandit served as the vanguard assault group leader of the Kuomintang secret service armed forces, attacking the revolting troops. This bandit also participated in Hu Zongnan's "China Revolutionary Comrades Association," serving as the deputy captain of the bandit Yuexi Special Agent Brigade, colluding with well-known secret service bandits to shoot and kill local progressive figures and expand the bandit armed forces. Under Hu's instructions, he vainly attempted to remain an enemy of the people for a long time, and was finally captured by the People's Liberation Army last spring.
