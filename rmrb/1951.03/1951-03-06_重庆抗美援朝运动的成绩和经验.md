　　The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Chongqing was conducted in conjunction with major commemorative festivals and various specific tasks. The movement vigorously carried out propaganda and systematic ideological education, closely integrating mass parades and demonstrations with accusations of American imperialist crimes, thus creating a broad and in-depth mass anti-American and patriotic movement.

　　In the early stages of the Korean War, the general public's thinking was mainly characterized by fear of world war, fear of the atomic bomb, and fear of Chiang Kai-shek and the Americans staging a comeback. Special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors and create fear, causing anxiety. After widespread explanations and propaganda, especially after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war and its significant victories, the rumors spread by special agents were effectively countered, and people's minds were stabilized. The masses believed that we would certainly be able to defeat American aggression, but they also feared "getting burned." Industrialists, businessmen, and some democratic figures showed a "mixture of joy and fear," with unstable emotions. To further deepen the movement, focused on organizing systematic anti-American patriotic political and current affairs education, in conjunction with the specific situations and practical work of people from all walks of life. Generally, various forms of propaganda were first carried out among organized masses to stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, and then demonstrations in support of Resist America, Aid Korea were organized. In this way, many backward masses who had not paid much attention to politics in the past were also drawn into the struggle, making the movement's momentum magnificent and its scale increasingly large. For example, during the August 1st Army Day celebrations, in the central district of Chongqing City and the Jiangbei and Beibei districts alone, 709 current affairs reports and mass meetings, 2,312 discussion meetings, 285 street propaganda events, 2,295 wall posters, and 24,662 cartoons were held in half a month, as well as a large number of leaflets and slogans, promoting the glorious combat history of the People's Liberation Army and its invincible power to defeat the aggressive forces of American imperialism. During the August 1st parade and demonstration, a total of 255,400 people participated, and the number of people signing for peace increased by more than 145,900. For the National Day celebration, 718 propaganda teams were dispatched in the central district of the city and Beibei, with the participation of 10,800 people. Districts 1 and 2 held more than 1,600 large and small discussion meetings and celebrations, promoting the great achievements of Chairman Mao's leadership of the People's Government in the past year and the strengthening of national power. A total of 336,000 people participated in National Day activities, accounting for more than a quarter of the city's population. During the anniversary of the liberation of Chongqing, 914 propaganda groups were dispatched, with the participation of 30,000 people, and 1,825 discussion meetings were held. A total of 146,400 people from the city center and suburban farmers participated in parades in the city (workers and students held separate events in the suburbs). In this way, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of the people was greatly improved, their enthusiasm for loving the motherland, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army was greatly enhanced, and their national self-esteem and self-confidence were greatly improved.

　　To consolidate and develop the movement, organized and systematic current affairs studies and widespread current affairs reports were conducted after the mass parades and demonstrations and discussion meetings, allowing everyone to freely express their opinions, conduct discussions, debates, and accusations of American imperialist aggression in groups. The more in-depth the movement, the more ideological problems were exposed, and the more urgent the need for ideological education. Therefore, a month of current affairs study was conducted among all cadres and all organized masses, systematically studying documents such as "How to Understand America," giving free rein to thought, and conducting discussions and criticisms of various pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American erroneous ideas, and answering various questions. Democratic figures and business circles also conducted special political studies, and the business circles mobilized 58 industries and established more than 40 study groups. After such studies, pro-American and fear-American remarks were greatly reduced, and special agent rumors were greatly dissipated. However, from an ideological point of view, the movement was not deep enough, mainly because it only obtained general theoretical and temporary answers, lacked perceptual and specific knowledge, and lacked systematic knowledge of basic theories. Therefore, fluctuations occurred again when new situations were encountered; at the same time, the ideological education of unorganized masses was very poor. Efforts to deepen the movement mainly involved focusing on the masses' ideological situation and separately unfolding accusations of American imperialist aggression, which easily touched people's hearts and aroused the hatred and indignation of the broad masses, and made the masses willing to consciously conduct ideological self-examination and criticism. Among students, the conscious accusation of American imperialist cultural aggression was launched in conjunction with applications to military cadre schools; among religious circles, the accusation of imperialism's use of religion to invade and poison the Chinese people was launched in conjunction with the religious reform movement; and in the business circles, the accusation of American imperialism's destruction of China's national industry and commerce was launched. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement was closely integrated with the masses' own interests, stimulating a high tide of patriotism among the masses.

　　Chongqing's Resist America, Aid Korea movement has achieved considerable success: it has initially eliminated erroneous ideas of fearing, worshiping, and being pro-American; basically overcome the fear of world war and the atomic bomb; initially established the correct concept of hating, despising, and scorning America; and greatly improved national self-esteem and self-confidence. The prestige of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army among the masses has been further enhanced. People who were deliberately alienated from the People's Government in the past due to fear of an American-Chiang comeback are now actively approaching the People's Government. The patriotic fervor of resisting America has impacted all democratic classes and transformed into the actual actions of the broad masses. The vast numbers of workers and students are enthusiastically signing up to join military cadre schools. Chongqing Xinhua Daily alone received more than 10,000 letters from people signing up to voluntarily join military cadre schools within half a month. Fifty-six thousand letters of comfort were sent to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The number of students applying to military cadre schools accounted for more than 90% of eligible students. In addition to making a large number of comfort bags, many women encouraged their sons to join the army. The workers' patriotic production competition is surging in various factories. The business circles held a demonstration parade of more than 45,000 people the day after hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, fearing to be left behind in patriotism. Subsequently, more than 80 industries joined together to establish patriotic covenants, realizing "annual tax clearance" to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The Young Pioneers held a demonstration parade of more than 12,000 people against America and special agents, accusing the American-Chiang special agents of harming children. Areas that were previously considered difficult to carry out work are now also enthusiastically carrying out the anti-American patriotic movement. For example, Christian, Catholic, and their affiliated schools, hospitals, relief agencies, and other organizations have actively and enthusiastically held anti-American patriotic demonstrations, donating money, writing letters to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and opposing Austin's slanders. Heads of churches and many priests and nuns who had never participated in mass political activities participated in the parade. Many students from church schools realized that they had been poisoned by American cultural aggression, tearfully accusing the Americans of their crimes, recognizing that their thoughts had long been those of subjugated slaves, and that they were fortunate to have been liberated by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, so that their souls could return to the embrace of the motherland. Young male and female believers who previously thought that following Chairman Mao would prevent them from following Christ now felt that Chairman Mao was their savior and that they should follow Chairman Mao forever. The general public said that they were not afraid of anything with Chairman Mao, and that following Chairman Mao would not be wrong. Therefore, the implementation of various policies of the People's Government has been smoother than before. People from all walks of life have begun to implement their patriotic enthusiasm into their actual actions.

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Chongqing has made us deeply aware of the profound extent to which American imperialism has culturally invaded and poisoned the minds of the Chinese people, which was beyond our expectations. In the movement to accuse American imperialism of its crimes in various schools, ordinary believers and many students reflected: "In the past, we not only lost our national self-esteem and self-confidence, but also had no concept of the country at all." Some said that they used to wish they could become Americans, complaining that their parents were not Americans, and some even hoped to die sooner to be reincarnated as Americans. Previously, a graduate of Qiujing Middle School who went to the United States to study committed suicide because he was insulted and thought the Chinese were shameful. Some people thought that everything in America was good, and only regarded the American insults to Chinese women as romantic affairs. Some said that they used to hope that China would become America so that they could live the American way of life. Some said that they admired the "Western heroes" in American movies for their gangster-like lives and hoped that the mayor of Chongqing would be an American. In the past, many schools had a group of students who organized pirate clubs, specializing in learning the American gangster dress and fighting everywhere and molesting female students. Some said that they almost became beasts after watching American pornographic movies. This was not only the case in church schools, but also in general schools, especially in so-called Westernized schools.

　　In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, it can be seen that the ideological development of our cadres often differs from that of the masses. When the Korean War broke out, the masses were panicked, but the cadres were indifferent; after the American invading army landed in Incheon and occupied Pyongyang, the cadres' thoughts fluctuated more than those of the masses. Due to differences in awareness, the ideological development of the masses is also inconsistent. Therefore, propaganda to the masses must be based on the thoughts and reactions of the masses, and cannot be based on the cadres' subjective assumptions and made out of thin air. When the masses consciously express their opinions and expose their thoughts, it is necessary to distinguish the backward thoughts of the masses from the rumors of special agents. In order to involve all kinds of masses with different levels of awareness in the movement, on the one hand, it is necessary to combine the specific situations and practical work of the masses, and on the other hand, it is necessary to use patriotic actions that everyone can do as a general requirement, and not use a few vanguards as the standard. For example, in the early stage, some people thought that only joining the People's Volunteer Army counted as resisting America and loving the country, which affected the promotion and deepening of the movement.

　　To make the Resist America, Aid Korea movement unfold, deepen, solidify, and last, and become a regular task, it is first necessary to conduct propaganda and education universally and systematically. In propaganda and education, it is also necessary to combine the various actual situations of the masses, and raise perceptual understanding to rational understanding, in order to completely solve ideological problems. In the past, many people lacked a perceptual understanding of American imperialism, and they felt that American imperialism was hateful in their hearts, but they could not hate it. They said that it was easy to establish hatred of America, but it was not easy to establish hatred of American feelings. After accusing American imperialism of its crimes, everyone's hatred of American imperialism was aroused, and at the same time they felt that American imperialism was despicable. Situation maps and charts comparing the strength of the enemy and ourselves have a great propaganda effect on the general public. In the past, many workers did not believe that America's invasion of Korea was to invade China. After reading the situation maps of China, Korea, and the United States, they suddenly realized and said: "America is so far away from Korea, and Korea is so small, why bother to fight so hard? Obviously, it is because Korea is connected to China, and occupying Korea will make it easier to attack China."

### 重庆抗美援朝运动的成绩和经验

　　重庆抗美援朝运动的成绩和经验
    重庆市的抗美援朝运动，是结合着重大的纪念节日和各种具体的工作进行的。运动中大力进行了宣传鼓动和有系统的思想教育，将广大群众性的游行示威和控诉美帝国主义罪行密切配合起来，因而造成了广泛而深入的群众性的反美爱国的运动。
    在朝鲜战争初期，一般群众的思想情况，主要是怕世界大战，怕原子弹，怕蒋美卷土重来，特务分子乘机造谣恐吓，人心不安。经过普遍的宣传解释，特别是中国人民志愿军参战后获得重大的胜利，有力地打击了特务分子的谣言，安定了人心，群众相信我们一定能战胜美国侵略势力，但又怕“惹火烧身”。工商业者和部分民主人士表现“一则以喜，一则以惧”，情绪动荡不稳。为使运动继续深入发展，结合各界人民的各种具体情况和实际工作，着重于组织有系统的反美爱国的政治时事教育，一般的，是先对有组织的群众进行各种形式的宣传鼓动，激发人民群众的爱国热情，然后号召组织抗美援朝的示威游行。这样，把许许多多过去不多过问政治的落后群众，也吸收到斗争的行列里来了，使运动的声势雄壮，规模日见巨大。例如：八一建军节纪念，仅重庆市中心区及江北、北碚两区在半个月中，即举行了时事报告与群众大会七○九次，座谈会二、三一二次，街头宣传二八五次，出墙报二、二九五份，漫画二四、六六二幅，以及大量的传单、标语等，宣传人民解放军光荣的战斗历史，战无不胜的强大力量，可以打败美帝国主义的侵略势力。到八一节游行示威时，参加群众共达二十五万五千四百人，同时和平签名人数又增加十四万五千九百余人。国庆纪念节，仅市中心区及北碚即出动宣传队七一八队，参加人数一万零八百人，一、二区开大小座谈会和庆祝会一千六百余次，宣传毛主席领导人民政府一年来的伟大成就与国家力量的增强，参加国庆活动的群众共有三十三万六千余人，占全市人口四分之一强。重庆解放周年纪念时，出动宣传组九一四个，参加者达三万人，开座谈会一、八二五次，市中心区及郊区农民参加市内游行的（工人学生在郊外单独举行）共十四万六千余人。这样，使广大人民群众的思想觉悟大大提高了，他们热爱祖国，热爱人民政府与人民解放军的热情大大提高了，民族的自尊心与自信心大大提高了。
    为使运动巩固与发展下去，在广大群众性的游行示威与座谈会之后，即抓紧时机进行了有组织的有系统的时事学习与普遍的时事报告，让大家在小组中自由发表意见、进行讨论、争辩与控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行，结合群众切身利益，运动愈深入，思想暴露的问题愈多，迫切要求思想教育。因而在全体干部和一切有组织的群众中，进行一个月的时事学习，系统地学习《怎样认识美国》等文件，发挥自由思想，进行讨论、批判各种亲美、崇美、恐美的错误思想，解答各种疑难。民主人士和工商界还专门进行政治学习，工商界发动了五十八个行业，成立了四十多个学习小组。经过这样学习后，恐美亲美的言论是大为减少了，特务谣言也大为消散了。但从思想上看，运动还不够深入，主要是只得到一般的理论的暂时的解答，缺乏感性的具体知识，也缺乏基本理论的系统知识。所以一遇到新的情况又发生了波动；同时无组织群众的思想教育很差。努力使运动深入一步，主要办法是结合群众思想情况，分别展开控诉美帝国主义侵略的罪行，容易打动人心，激起广大群众的仇恨与愤慨，且使群众乐于自觉的思想检查与批判。在学生方面，结合投考军事干部学校展开自觉控诉美帝国主义文化侵略的罪行；在宗教界方面，结合宗教革新运动，展开控诉帝国主义利用宗教侵略毒害中国人民的罪恶；工商界方面，控诉美帝国主义摧残中国民族工商业的罪行。使抗美援朝运动和群众自身利益密切结合起来，激发了群众的爱国主义的高潮。
    重庆的抗美援朝运动已经获得相当大的成绩：初步扫除了恐美崇美亲美的错误思想，基本上克服了害怕世界大战，害怕原子弹的恐美心理，初步建立了仇美鄙美蔑美的正确观念，大大提高了民族的自尊心与自信心。共产党和人民政府以及人民解放军在群众中的威信更加提高了，过去害怕美蒋卷土重来而故意与人民政府疏远的人们，现在积极向人民政府靠拢了。抗美爱国的热潮已经冲激着各民主阶层，变成为广大群众的实际行动。广大工人学生踊跃报名参加军事干部学校。仅重庆新华日报在半个月内，即有一万余人签名投书自愿报名参加军事干部学校。慰问朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的信件五万六千封。学生投考军事干部学校，报名人数占适龄学生百分之九十以上。妇女除大量做慰问袋外，许多妇女勉子投军。工人的爱国生产竞赛，正在各厂澎湃着。工商界在听到平壤解放消息的第二天，就举行四万五千余人的示威游行，唯恐爱国后人。随着集合了八十多个行业展开订立爱国公约，实现了“年税年清”以支援中国人民志愿军。少年儿童队举行了一万二千多人的抗美反特务的游行示威，控诉美蒋特务陷害少年儿童的罪恶。过去认为较难开展工作的地方，现在也热烈地开展抗美爱国运动。例如基督教、天主教及其所办之学校、医院、救济机关等团体，都积极热烈举行抗美爱国的示威游行，捐款、写信慰问中国人民志愿军，反对奥斯汀的诬蔑。教会的首脑分子与许多从未参加群众政治活动的神父、修女等，都参加了游行的行列。许多教会学校的学生都觉悟到自己受了美帝的文化侵略所毒害，痛哭流涕地控诉美帝的罪恶，认识了自己思想上早已成了亡国奴，今天幸蒙毛主席共产党将自己解放出来，灵魂才又回到祖国的怀抱。过去认为跟着毛主席走，就不能跟基督走的男女青年教徒，现在觉得毛主席是自己的救星，要永远跟毛主席走了。一般群众都说有了毛主席，什么也不怕，跟毛主席走是不会错的。因此，人民政府的各种政策的贯彻都比以前顺利。各阶层人民都开始将自己的爱国热情贯彻于自己的实际行动中。
    在重庆的抗美援朝运动中，使我们深深地感到美帝国主义对我国文化侵略及毒化中国人民思想的深重程度，是非我们所预料的。各学校在开展控诉美帝国主义罪行的运动中，一般教徒和许多学生都反省说：“过去不但失去民族自尊心与自信心，而且根本无国家观念。”有的说过去恨不得变为美国人，埋怨自己父母不是美国人，甚至有人希望早死些去投胎变为美国人。以前求精中学有个毕业生到美国留学，受了侮辱认为中国人可耻而自杀。有些人认为美国什么都好，对美国人侮辱中国妇女只当作风流事情看待。有的说过去希望中国变成美国，好过美国的生活方式。有的说羡慕美国电影上的“西部英雄”那种强盗式的生活，希望重庆市长由美国人来当，以前许多学校有一批学生组织海盗社，专学美国强盗的装束到处打架和调戏女学生就是从此而来的。有的说过去看了美国的色情电影，简直要变成禽兽。不只教会学校如此，一般学校特别是所谓洋化的学校都有类似情形。
    在抗美援朝运动中，可以看到我们干部的思想发展往往和群众不一致的。朝鲜战争发生时，群众思想发生恐慌，干部却满不在乎；美国侵略军在仁川登陆占领平壤之后，干部思想又较群众波动为大。由于觉悟程度的不同，群众思想发展亦不一致，因此对群众宣传，必须根据群众的思想和反应，不可按干部的主观推想而凭空去作。在群众自觉发表意见，暴露思想的时候，要把落后的群众思想和特务的谣言区别开来。为要把各种觉悟不同的群众都卷入运动，一方面要结合群众的具体情况与实际工作，一方面要以人人都能作到的爱国行动作为一般的要求，不能以少数先锋队作为标准。例如初期有些人以为只有参加人民志愿军才算抗美爱国的偏向，结果影响运动的推广与深入。
    要使抗美援朝运动展开、深入、坚实、持久，成为一个经常的工作，首先要普遍地系统地进行宣传教育。在宣传教育中，又要结合群众的各种实际情况，通过感性的认识提高到理性的认识，才能彻底解决思想问题。过去有许多人由于缺乏对美帝国主义的感性认识，心中觉得美帝国主义可恨，但恨不起来；他们说仇美思想容易建立，仇美的情感不容易建立，到了控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行后，大家对美帝国主义的仇恨激发起来了，同时也觉得美帝国主义可鄙了。形势地图与敌我力量对比的图表，对一般群众的宣传作用很大。过去许多工人不大相信美国侵略朝鲜，就是要侵略中国的道理，待看了中国朝鲜与美国的形势地图之后，都恍然大悟说：“美国离朝鲜那么远，朝鲜又那么小，为什么要费那么大的气力去打呢？很显然的，就是因为朝鲜接连中国，占了朝鲜，就好打中国。”
