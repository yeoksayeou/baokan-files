　　Private Individuals Can Invest in the Construction of Farms and Ranches

　　To the Editor:

　　I have experience in raising livestock and managing farms, and I also have some capital. I hope to operate an experimental farm or a small livestock ranch. I don't know what the People's Government's policy is toward such ventures. Where can I rent (or purchase) land? What are the specific procedures? I would appreciate it if you could answer these questions.

Mr. Qi Zhongming:

Regarding your questions about operating farms and ranches, the relevant authorities have provided the following information:

The Chahar Provincial People's Government, in order to develop the Sanggan River silted irrigation area in Yanbei and the Chabei grassland area, and to increase agricultural and livestock production, formulated the "Chahar Province Silted Irrigation Area Farm Reclamation Measures" and the "Chahar Province Chabei Grassland Investment and Construction Ranch Measures" in January and February of this year. Some of the contents of these two measures are:

　　(1) Farms and ranches are divided into three types: those operated by individual investment, those operated by private joint investment, and those operated by public-private joint ventures. There are no restrictions on the size.

　　(2) Application procedures: You must first determine the business plan, and then register with the Chahar Provincial People's Government.

　　(3) Land use: The lease term is 30 years, and it can be renewed upon expiration. During the lease term, it can be transferred, reduced, or expanded as needed.

　　(4) In order to encourage private investment, the People's Government not only stipulates preferential measures, but also can provide necessary assistance—including loans, investment, and various kinds of help in business and technical operations.

If you need to know more detailed information, you can write directly to the Chahar Provincial People's Government to inquire.

　　私人可以投资建设农场、牧场编辑同志：
    本人有牧畜和经营农场的经验，并且有一部分资金，我希望能经营一处试验农场或小型牧畜场之类的事业，不知道人民政府对这类事业的政策如何？何处可以租（或购）到土地？其具体办法又如何？均请惠予解答。
                                       天津  祁仲鸣祁仲鸣先生：
    来信所问有关经营农场、牧场的事情，经有关机关介绍了以下的情况：
    察哈尔省人民政府，为了开发雁北桑乾河淤灌区及察北草原地带，以增加农、牧生产，曾于今年一、二月间，制定了“察哈尔省淤灌区农场招垦办法”及“察哈尔省察北草原招资建设牧场办法”。这两项办法中的一部分内容是：
    （一）农、牧场分三种：个人投资经营者，私人合资经营者，公私合营者。规模大小不限。
    （二）申请手续：须先确定经营计划，然后向察哈尔省人民政府办理登记。
    （三）土地使用：租期为三十年，期满可以续约。租期中如因故须要转让、缩小或扩充都可以。
    （四）人民政府为了鼓励私人投资，除规定有优待办法；并可以给予必要扶助——包括贷款、投资以及经营业务技术上的各种帮助。
    你如果需要知道更详细的情形，可直接写信向察哈尔省人民政府询问。
                                               编者
