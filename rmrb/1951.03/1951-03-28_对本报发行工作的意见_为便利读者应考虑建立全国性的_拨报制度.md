    Opinions on the Newspaper's Distribution Work
    Considering Establishing a Nationwide "Newspaper Transfer System" to Facilitate Readers
    Comrades Editors:
    I saved my February allowance to subscribe to the People's Daily for my family (living in Shanghai) at the Qingdao Post Office's distribution department. However, the comrades at the post office said, "This won't work. The newspaper would have to be forwarded from Qingdao Post Office to Shanghai, which would not only be slow, but we would also have to pay remittance fees." Later, I had to remit one month's subscription fee of 18,000 yuan from Qingdao to the Shanghai Post Office's distribution department to subscribe to the newspaper. This cost me an additional 500 yuan in remittance fees and 2,000 yuan in registered postage, while also increasing the trouble and time wasted on remittance and registration.
    Currently, there are many comrades working in Shandong who are from other provinces. Although we are on the supply system and cannot have many savings, many comrades are willing to save some money to buy some inexpensive and educational books and periodicals for their families, loved ones, or friends, so that they can also make progress together. However, the remittance fee and registered postage for subscribing to a newspaper are too high, which is a considerable burden for readers like us who cannot subscribe for a long time due to economic constraints.
    I suggest that the post office should find a way to allow readers to pay at a post office in location A, and the post office in location B can also send newspapers and periodicals. If this is done, even if there are any remittance fees or the like, they can be paid by the readers (of course, it won't be much). I believe that this will be convenient for many readers.

    Editor's Note: This subscription method of the Qingdao Post Office is indeed very inconvenient for readers, and this phenomenon probably exists in more than just Qingdao. Comrade Zhao Cisheng's opinion is very noteworthy, and it is hoped that the General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will consider it.

### 对本报发行工作的意见  为便利读者应考虑建立全国性的“拨报制度”

　　对本报发行工作的意见
    为便利读者应考虑建立全国性的“拨报制度”编辑同志：
    我节省了二月份的津贴去青岛邮局发行科给家里（住上海）订人民日报。但邮局的同志说：“这样不行。这样报纸就得经青岛邮局再转寄上海，不但时间慢，我们还要贴汇费。”后来我只好把一个月报费一万八千元，由青岛汇到上海邮局发行科去订报。如此使我多花了五百元的汇费和二千元的挂号邮资，同时还增加了我一些邮汇挂号的麻烦和时间上的浪费。
    目前在山东的外省工作同志很多，虽然我们是供给制，不能有很多积蓄，但很多同志都愿意节省些钱，买些价廉而有教育意义的书刊给家里、爱人或朋友，让他们也一同进步。但订一次报的汇费和挂号邮资太多，这对于我们因经济限制不可能长期订阅的读者来说，确是一个不小的负担。
    我建议邮局应设法做到读者在甲地邮局付费，乙地邮局也能发寄报刊。这样做就是需要什么汇费之类，也可由读者付给（当然不会很多的），我相信这样做是会使很多读者感到便利的。
                                   人民解放军某部  赵慈生
    编者按：青岛邮局这种订报办法对读者确是很不方便的，目前这种现象恐怕还不只青岛一地存在着。赵慈生同志的意见是很值得注意的，希望邮电部邮政总局对此加以考虑。
