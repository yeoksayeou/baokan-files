Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 7th: The preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held its second meeting on March 6th, chaired by British representative Davies. It is revealed that the meeting heard statements from US representative Jessup, French representative Parrot, and British representative Davies.

News sources say that these three representatives supported the draft agenda for the Foreign Ministers' Conference that they jointly proposed. They attempted to create the impression that, based on such an agenda, the specific issues raised by the Soviet delegation at this meeting and the Foreign Ministers' Conference could be discussed. The representatives of the three Western countries were particularly keen to oppose including the proposal on implementing the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and preventing the resurgence of German militarism on the agenda. They tried to prove that this issue could not be discussed separately from the overall tension in today's world. In order to prevent the discussion of this issue and other clear and concrete proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation (the solution of which is dependent on eliminating the current international tension and guaranteeing European peace and security), the representatives of the three countries even insisted that the wording of these proposals predetermined the solutions to these issues.

In response to the representatives of the three Western countries, Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out that their insistence that the agenda they proposed made it possible for the Soviet representative to discuss all issues of concern to the Soviet government was absolutely unfounded. Gromyko pointed out that the purpose of this statement was to avoid adopting the purposeful and clearly defined specific proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, and to replace them with other proposals that did not present the Foreign Ministers' Conference with any clear tasks, the completion of which would truly help guarantee peace in Europe and improve the European situation. Gromyko pointed out that the draft agenda proposed by the Soviet delegation—especially the proposal on eliminating German militarism and preventing the resurgence of German militarism—was in line with the task of consolidating peace and security in Europe.

The next meeting will be held on March 7th.

　　四外长预备会议第二日
    美、英、法固执原提案
    竟反对把履行波茨坦协定的议案列入议程
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎七日讯：苏、美、英、法四国外长会议预备会议于三月六日举行第二次会议，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。据透露：会议听取了美国代表耶塞普、法国代表巴罗第和英国代表戴维斯的发言。
    新闻界人士得到的消息说，这三个代表都支持他们共同提出的外长会议议程草案。他们企图制造出一种印象，似乎根据这样的议程，苏联代表团在这个会议和外长会议上提出的具体问题都可以得到讨论。三个西方国家代表特别热中于反对把关于履行肃清德国军国主义和防止德国重新军国主义化的波茨坦协定的议案列入议程。他们竭力想证明不能离开今日世界的整个紧张局势来单独讨论这个问题。为了阻止讨论这个问题以及苏联代表团提出的其他明确具体的提案（要消除目前国际紧张局势并保障欧洲和平与安全是有赖于这些问题的解决的），三国代表竟然硬说这些议案的提法预先就确定了这些问题的解决办法。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在回答三个西方国家代表时指出：他们硬说他们所提出的议程已使苏联代表有讨论苏联政府所关心的一切问题之可能，这种说法是绝对没有根据的。葛罗米柯指出这种说法的目的在于不采纳苏联所提出的目的性明确的具体建议，而代之以另外一些建议，这种建议并不向外长会议提出任何明确清楚的任务，而这种任务的完成，将真正有助于保证欧洲的和平和改善欧洲局势。葛罗米柯指出：苏联代表团提出的议程草案——特别是关于肃清德国军国主义和防止德国重新军国主义化的议案——是符合于巩固欧洲的和平与安全的任务的。
    下次会议将于三月七日举行。
