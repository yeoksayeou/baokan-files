　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 22nd: TASS, New York, March 22nd: The New York Post and the New York Times published news stories falsely claiming that the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik, had held negotiations with the so-called "Good Offices Committee" and Trygve Lie.

　　Regarding this, Malik issued the following statement to the press on the 21st: "Concerning the news stories published by the New York Post and the New York Times, we consider it necessary to state that I have not held any negotiations with members of the so-called United Nations Good Offices Committee, nor with Mr. Trygve Lie. Such news stories published by the aforementioned newspapers are without foundation."

　　马立克发表声明斥纽约两家报纸造谣
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：纽约邮报和纽约时报刊载消息，硬说苏联驻联合国组织的代表马立克曾与所谓“斡旋委员会”和赖伊进行谈判。
    关于这一点，马立克在二十一日向报界发表下列声明：“关于纽约邮报和纽约时报所刊载的消息，我们认为有必要声明：我并没有与所谓联合国斡旋委员会的委员，也没有与赖伊先生进行过任何谈判。上述报纸所刊载的这种消息是没有根据的。”
