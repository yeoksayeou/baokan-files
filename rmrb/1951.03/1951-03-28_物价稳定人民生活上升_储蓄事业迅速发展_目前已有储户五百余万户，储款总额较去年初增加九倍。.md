　　Stable Prices, Rising Living Standards
    Rapid Development of Savings         
    Currently There are Over Five Million Depositors, with Total Savings Increasing Ninefold Compared to the Beginning of Last Year.
    The savings business developed by the People's Bank in various regions has achieved remarkable results in the past year. As of the end of February this year, the number of depositors has increased to more than five million, and the total amount of savings has increased ninefold compared to the beginning of last year. The rapid development of people's savings is fundamentally due to the rapid recovery of production in vast liberated areas, the stabilization of prices, and the gradual growth of people's savings capacity. In order to meet the needs of the broad masses, the People's Bank has adopted the following various measures to promote the development of savings.
    First, various savings deposits are organized based on the needs of the masses. Different methods were adopted at different times. In the past, when prices were rising, value-linked savings were offered to protect depositors from the impact of price fluctuations and to reduce speculation in the market. After prices stabilized in April last year, capital-protected and value-guaranteed savings were introduced (value guaranteed based on real value when prices rise, and capital guaranteed based on the original currency when prices fall). This method allows depositors to not worry about price fluctuations and fully takes care of the interests of depositors. In September last year, the People's Bank convened a national savings conference. After careful study, it was decided to universally increase fixed-amount savings and prize-winning capital-protected and value-guaranteed savings throughout the country. Fixed-amount savings, due to their simple deposit and withdrawal procedures, have collected over 60 billion in savings in Shanghai alone within a month and a half since their introduction. Prize-winning savings have small denominations, and in addition to guaranteeing capital and paying interest, there is also the opportunity to win prizes, which greatly encourages the public's interest in saving. The savings situation in various regions is even more enthusiastic. For example, in Beijing, three phases have been held, and hundreds of thousands of numbers in each phase have been fully subscribed before the deadline, and many factory workers have made reservations and registered for storage in advance.
    Secondly, savings institutions are universally established to facilitate depositors' deposits and withdrawals. Banks at all levels across the country generally handle savings business. Small savings offices have been set up in large numbers in factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and important market towns in rural areas. In southern Jiangsu, Zhenjiang, Wuxi and other places, many savings pavilions have been set up in important streets, and active members of staff, teachers and students who are enthusiastic about savings have been invited to serve as special business personnel as a bridge between banks and depositors. In rural areas, favorable conditions have been created for carrying out savings business due to the increasing prosperity of farmers' lives. According to statistics from the Chahar Provincial Bank, farmers' savings currently account for more than 70% of the total savings in the province. In addition, post offices and cooperatives are widely entrusted to handle savings, so that savings institutions can extend to every corner. At the same time, mobile patrol groups and neighborhood service groups are also organized in various places to regularly go to various places to handle door-to-door collection and payment of savings deposits, changing the past practice of banks waiting for customers to come to the door, which has been welcomed by the majority of depositors.
    Thirdly, strengthening service work and improving the work system also have a great effect on the development of savings business. For example, banks issue salaries on behalf of industrial and commercial enterprises, institutions, and groups, which on the one hand reduces the trouble of salary-paying units, and also facilitates employee savings. Some units have more than 80% of their employees participating in savings when paying salaries. In addition, they also act as agents for depositors to pay taxes, rent, water and electricity bills, tuition fees, and remittances. As the scope of bank services expands, the number of depositors also increases. At the same time, due to the improvement of handling procedures and work systems, work efficiency has been improved, and the difficulty of employees and depositors not being able to deposit and withdraw money during working hours has been solved.

　　物价稳定人民生活上升
    储蓄事业迅速发展         
    目前已有储户五百余万户，储款总额较去年初增加九倍。
    人民银行在各地开展的储蓄业务，在过去一年中已取得显著的成绩。至今年二月底止，储户已增加到五百多万户，储存总额较去年初增加了九倍。人民储蓄之所以得到飞跃发展，基本上是由于广大地区解放后生产迅速恢复，物价趋于稳定，人民的储蓄能力逐渐滋长。人民银行为了满足广大人民的需要，采取了以下多种办法，推动储蓄事业的发展。
    首先是从群众需要出发举办各种储蓄存款。在不同时期采用了不同的方式。过去在物价上涨情况下曾办理折实储蓄，使储户免受物价波动的影响，也减少了市场上的投机活动。在去年四月间物价趋稳后又举办了保本保值储蓄（物价上涨按折实保值，物价下落按原存货币保本）这种办法储户可以不必顾虑物价的涨落，充分的照顾到储户的利益。去年九月人民银行召开了全国储蓄会议，经审慎研究后决定在全国各地普遍增办定额储蓄及有奖的保本保值储蓄。定额储蓄由于存取手续简便，举办以来上海一地在一个半月中即已收储了六百余亿。有奖储蓄，面额小，除了保本付息外，又有得奖的机会，大大地鼓舞了群众的储蓄兴趣，各地收储情况更为踊跃，例如北京，现已举办三期，每期数十万号都在收储截止前收储足额，而且有许多工厂职工在事先纷纷进行预约登记存储。
    其次是普遍设立收储机构，便利储户存取。全国各级银行都普遍办理储蓄业务。在工厂、企业和机关、学校以及在农村的重要集镇都大量的设置了小型的储蓄所。在苏南、镇江、无锡等地，选择重要街道设置了不少储蓄亭，并聘请职工、教员、学生中热心储蓄的积极分子，担任特约营业员作为银行与储户间的桥梁。在农村中由于农民生活日渐富裕，为开展储蓄业务创造了有利条件，据察哈尔省行的统计，目前该省的农民储蓄已占全部储蓄总额的百分之七十以上。另外又广泛的委托邮局、合作社代办储蓄，使储蓄机构普遍伸到每个角落里去，同时各地还组织了巡回流动小组，及里弄服务小组，经常赴各处办理登门收付储蓄存款，转变了过去银行坐等顾客上门的作风，受到了广大储户的欢迎。
    再次是加强服务工作，和改进工作制度，对储蓄业务的开展也有很大的作用。如银行代工商企业、机关团体等单位发放薪资，一方面减少了发薪单位的麻烦，同时也便利了职工储蓄，有些单位在发薪时有百分之八十以上职工都参加了储蓄。此外还代理储户缴纳税捐、房租、水电、学费以及代理汇款等工作，随着银行服务面的扩大，储户也增多了。同时由于改进办事手续和工作制度，提高了工作效率，解决了职工储户在工作时间不能存钱取钱的困难。
