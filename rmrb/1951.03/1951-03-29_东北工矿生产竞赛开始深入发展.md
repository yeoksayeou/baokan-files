The patriotic production competition movement, involving over one million workers in Northeast China, is beginning to develop in-depth. The current characteristics of the movement are: (1) Trade unions in various regions are universally promoting advanced production experiences according to industrial systems or within the same type of work, in order to overcome and prevent the tendency of purely physical competition; (2) Most workshops and teams have formulated competition conditions that are beginning to be linked with solving the key problems of current production in their units, thus significantly reducing the phenomenon of formalism; (3) Major industries have begun to actively rectify grassroots trade union organizations within the competition movement. These characteristics show that the competition movement in various regions is gradually developing towards becoming a regular practice.

In the past four months or so, factories and mines have seen the emergence of over ten thousand advanced producers, several thousand advanced production teams, and many advanced workshops. However, in the early stages of the competition movement, many factories and mines did not promptly summarize and promote various advanced experiences, making it difficult to correct the purely overtime-focused tendency that commonly occurred in the initial stages of the movement. Recently, after trade unions at all levels emphasized the promotion of experiences in improving labor organization, operating methods, and developing rationalization proposals, many factories no longer adopted the method of working overtime, but instead adopted other advanced methods. For example, after the clothing, rubber, leather, and other eight industries promoted the experience of changing labor organization from Jiang Wanshou of the Northeast Clothing Factory No. 1, production efficiency increased by more than 20% compared to the past.

The methods adopted by factories and mines when promoting advanced experiences are: inviting advanced producers to give reports, holding technical seminars, organizing advanced producers to demonstrate techniques, or organizing employees to visit the work sites of advanced producers. Among these, organizing technical demonstrations and on-site visits have yielded the greatest results.

Another serious deviation in the past competition movement was that the competition plans of many factories and mines lacked specific central goals. In particular, the competition conditions for teams were not formulated based on the key problems in production during each period in their units, thus hindering the progress of the movement. Recently, due to the attention paid by trade unions at all levels to correcting this problem, the competition conditions of many units have conformed to the needs of current production. For example, the No. 4 branch of a certain machinery factory used to list many clauses in its competition conditions, resulting in the competition becoming a mere formality. Later, the foundry team of the branch, focusing on its most serious shortcoming—the waste of artificial sand—proposed the competition condition of guaranteeing "saving 20 jin of artificial sand and two nails per sand box," and the loss rate quickly decreased. Since late February, the scrap rate of the branch has also decreased by 40% compared to before, and the output has increased by more than three times.

The long-term unsoundness of grassroots trade union organizations in many factories and mines is one of the important reasons that the production competition movement cannot develop normally. Recently, in order to solve this problem and improve the ability of grassroots trade union cadres, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has opened various training classes to train grassroots trade union chairmen, committee members, and section-level cadres of provincial and municipal trade unions and industrial trade unions. Many industrial trade unions and local trade unions are also actively carrying out the work of rectifying grassroots trade unions. For example, the trade union of the No. 3 workshop of a certain factory in Jinzhou City used to not care about production at all, and only engaged in cultural and recreational activities. Not only did the administration say that the trade union was ineffective, but the workers were also dissatisfied. After rectification, the trade union cadres went to the work site to lead the workers in doing a good job in production, and as a result, the production efficiency of the entire factory increased by more than one time, and the cost decreased by 46%.

In order to make production competition a regular movement, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions requires trade unions at all levels to closely cooperate with factory and mine administrations in future production competitions, based on the different situations of factories, mines, and workshops, so that the production competition movement is closely integrated with improving the regular work of enterprises. The main problems to be solved at present are: (1) To accurately formulate production plans for factories, mines, workshops, teams, and even individuals from top to bottom. (2) To establish a systematic production management system, such as technical operating procedures, regular maintenance of equipment, supply and inspection of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, standardization of product technical specifications, formulation of technical standards for various different types of work, and rational organization of production processes. These systems must be continuously improved in the production competition movement in the future. (3) On the basis of formulating relatively reasonable quotas and establishing a systematic production management system, to promote the piece-rate wage system, establish a regular reward system, and improve workers' welfare facilities and safety conditions.

### 东北工矿生产竞赛开始深入发展

　　东北工矿生产竞赛开始深入发展
    全东北百余万职工参加的爱国主义生产竞赛运动，开始深入发展。目前运动的特点是：（一）各地工会都普遍地按产业系统或在同一工种中推广先进生产经验，以克服和防止单纯体力比赛的偏向；（二）大部分车间及小组订立竞赛条件，已开始与解决本单位当前生产的关键问题结合起来，因而形式主义的现象显著减少；（三）各主要产业已开始在竞赛运动中积极整顿基层工会组织。这些特点显示：各地的竞赛运动正在逐步向经常化发展。
    过去四个多月中，各厂矿曾涌现了万余名先进生产者、数千个先进生产小组和不少先进车间。但竞赛运动初期，许多厂矿并未及时总结和推广各种先进经验，致使运动初期普遍发生的单纯加班加点的偏向不易及时得到纠正。最近各级工会重视了推广改进劳动组织、操作方法和开展合理化建议的经验后，许多工厂就不再采用加班加点的方法，而采用其他先进的方法。如被服、橡胶、皮革等八个行业推广了东北被服一厂姜万寿的改变劳动组织的经验后，生产效率都比过去提高百分之二十以上。
    各厂矿在推广先进经验时所采取的办法是：邀请先进生产者作报告，召开技术座谈会，组织先进生产者表演技术，或组织职工到先进生产者的工作现场参观。其中以组织技术表演和实地参观两者收效最大。
    过去竞赛运动中的另一严重偏向，是许多厂矿的竞赛计划缺乏具体的中心目标，特别是小组的竞赛条件没有根据本单位每个时期生产中的关键问题来制订，因此障碍了运动的前进。最近，由于各级工会注意纠正这一问题，很多单位的竞赛条件已符合于当前生产的需要。如某机械工厂第四分场过去所订的竞赛条件总是罗列很多条文，结果使竞赛流于形式；后来该分场的翻砂班针对本身最严重的缺点——浪费人造砂的现象，提出保证“做一箱砂省二十斤人造砂及两个钉子”的竞赛条件，损耗率即迅速减少。二月下旬以来，该场的废品率也比以前降低了百分之四十，产量提高了三倍多。
    许多厂矿基层工会组织长期地不健全的现象，是使生产竞赛运动不能正常发展的重要原因之一。最近，东北总工会为解决这一问题，提高基层工会干部的能力，已开办了各种训练班，训练基层工会主席、委员及各省市工会、产业工会的科级干部。许多产业工会和地方工会也正积极进行整顿基层工会的工作。如锦州市某厂第三车间工会过去根本不问生产，单纯进行文化娱乐工作，不但行政上说工会不起作用，工人也都不满。经过整顿以后，工会干部下现场领导工人作好生产，结果全厂生产效率提高一倍以上，成本降低百分之四十六。
    为使生产竞赛成为一个经常性的运动，东北总工会要求各级工会根据各厂矿、车间不同情况，在今后生产竞赛中与厂矿行政密切配合，使生产竞赛运动与改进企业的经常工作密切结合起来。目前要解决的主要问题是：（一）自上而下地比较准确地订定厂矿、车间、小组以至个人的生产计划。（二）建立系统的生产管理制度，如技术操作规程、设备的定期检修、原材料半成品和成品的供应与检验、产品技术规格的统一、各个不同工种的技术标准的制定，以及合理地组织生产工序等。今后并须在生产竞赛运动中继续不断地改进这些制度。（三）在制订了比较合理的定额和建立了系统的生产管理制度的基础上，推行计件工资制度，建立经常的奖励制度以及改善工人福利设备和保安条件等。
