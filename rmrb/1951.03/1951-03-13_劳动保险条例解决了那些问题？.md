　　What Problems Does the Labor Insurance Regulations Solve?
       Meng Zhaohua
    The "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China," passed by the 73rd Government Affairs Council meeting of the Central People's Government on February 23rd and promulgated on February 26th, has come into effect on March 1st. Workers and staff will receive their entitled labor insurance benefits starting May 1st. This is unprecedented in China's history and is a new and important legal act in labor policy of the People's Democratic Dictatorship, following the Trade Union Law.
    Since 1922, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China's working class has struggled to achieve labor insurance! After thirty years of continuous efforts, they finally established a new democratic regime led by the working class, realizing the labor insurance program won through struggle. This new legislation is one of the fruits of revolutionary victory won with blood and lives. Therefore, the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations is a great joyous event for the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country.
    The Labor Insurance Regulations stipulate that the administration or the capitalist shall pay monthly labor insurance funds equivalent to three percent of the total wages of all workers and staff in the enterprise. This is certainly not as good as the Soviet Union's 3.8 to 10.7 percent, but it is superior to and far exceeds the insurance of capitalist countries, which is one of their methods of exploitation. Moreover, given the current limitations of the state's financial and economic situation, a large proportion of people are still living a hard life of supply. To be able to do this is already extremely difficult. So, what problems does the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations solve?
    First, it solves the problems of illness, injury, and disability. When workers and staff are injured at work, all treatment costs, medicine costs, hospitalization costs, meal costs during hospitalization, and travel expenses for medical treatment are borne by the enterprise administration or the capitalist. During the medical treatment period, wages are also paid as usual. When it is determined to be a disability, disability pensions of 75 percent and 60 percent of the wages are paid from the labor insurance fund, according to the severity of the disability, and disability subsidies of 5 to 20 percent of the wages.
    In case of illness or non-work-related injury, treatment is provided at the enterprise's medical institutions. If it is necessary to transfer to other hospitals due to the inability to treat, the administration or the capitalist shall also bear the costs, except for expensive medicines, travel expenses for medical treatment, and meal costs during hospitalization, which shall be borne by the individual. When the worker becomes disabled, unless there are other sources of income to maintain life, a relief payment of 20 to 30 percent of wages is given according to the length of service until death. Not only that, but also the relatives of workers and staff can enjoy free diagnosis and treatment at the enterprise's medical institutions or designated hospitals and half-price treatment for ordinary medicines, except for expensive medicines, travel expenses for medical treatment, hospitalization costs, meal costs during hospitalization and all other expenses which shall be borne by the individual.
    Second, it solves the problems of death and related matters. In case of death due to work, a funeral allowance of two months' average wage of the enterprise is paid, and a pension of 25 to 50 percent of the worker's wage is paid to the dependents, depending on the number of dependents who meet the conditions. In case of death due to non-work-related injury or death after retirement due to work-related injury leading to disability, a funeral allowance of one month's average wage of the enterprise is paid, and a relief payment of three to twelve months' wage of the worker is given to the family according to the length of service. In the case of death after retirement due to "old age" or "non-work-related disability that completely loses the ability to work", a funeral allowance of one month's average wage of the enterprise is given. If a direct relative dies, a funeral allowance of "one-third" and "one-quarter" of the average monthly wage of the enterprise is given for those "over ten years old" and "over one year old and under ten years old" respectively.
    We can clearly understand these problems by simply opening the old accounts and comparing them. Here, let's use a vivid example from Minister Li Lisan's "Several Explanations on the Draft" to illustrate: "My father worked as a handyman on the railway and was crushed to death by a train. We couldn't afford a coffin. My mother took me to the bureau to kowtow and beg, and we only got a few wooden boards to make a coffin. We didn't get half a cent of pension."
    Third, it solves the problem of old-age care. The ancient Chinese proverb "raise children to guard against old age, store grain to guard against famine" illustrates the situation in the old society where "people have no social security in old age" and "people are deeply concerned about living problems after they get old and their labor force declines." In the old society, there was only heavy oppression and exploitation, which inevitably led to the problem of old-age care, even more so than the problem of death. In the old society, it would be better if one "really died," but the problem was "being old and not dying." The saying "being old and not dying is being a thief" reflects how much the reactionary rulers of the old society hated the elderly!
    The Labor Insurance Regulations solve the problem of old-age care. Those who "are male and 60 years old, have worked for 25 years, are female and 50 years old, have worked for 20 years, and have worked in the enterprise for 10 years" can retire. They can enjoy a "pension subsidy of 35 to 60 percent of their wages" per month until death. If the work requires and the individual agrees to stay on the job, then in addition to the "deserved salary," they will receive an additional "on-the-job pension subsidy of 10 to 20 percent." In addition, in order to take care of those who work in environments harmful to the body, the regulations also stipulate that those who work underground, in high-temperature, low-temperature climates, or in chemical, ordnance, and other places harmful to health, should appropriately shorten their retirement age and the calculation method of their length of service.
    Fourth, it solves the maternity problems of women workers. The regulations stipulate: "Female workers and staff are given 56 days of leave before and after childbirth. During the maternity leave period, wages are paid as usual." and they enjoy "maternity subsidies." At the same time, appropriate care is also given to those who are still unable to work after the end of the maternity leave. It can be seen that, in addition to the principle of "distribution according to work", the People's Government has made this special and reasonable provision in order to take care of the special physiological state of women and to protect the second generation.
    Fifth, it solves the problems of collective insurance and preferential enjoyment. The regulations stipulate that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will be responsible for organizing collective insurance undertakings such as "sanatoriums, disability homes, nursing homes, orphanages, sanatoriums, and others." All workers and staff in enterprises implementing labor insurance have the right to enjoy benefits. "Labor models" and transferred "combat heroes" who have made special contributions to the enterprise have preferential rights. At the same time, there are preferential provisions for "illness", "non-work-related injury", "work-related injury", "disability", "pension for direct relatives of those who die due to work", and retirement and on-the-job pension subsidies. These provisions reflect how the People's Government respects and cares for the people's heroes who have made contributions to the people and the country.
    The implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations will solve the difficulties encountered by employees in enterprises, institutions, and schools in matters such as birth, old age, illness, and death. However, the labor insurance undertaking is a new undertaking. Therefore, we must deeply publicize and earnestly study the Labor Insurance Regulations in order to do the labor insurance work correctly and enable the broad masses of employees to devote themselves to production and work, so as to strengthen the economic and defense capabilities of our great motherland.

　　劳动保险条例解决了那些问题？
       孟昭华
    二月二十三日中央人民政府政务院第七十三次政务会议通过并于二月二十六日公布的《中华人民共和国劳动保险条例》，已于三月一日起生效实施了。工人和职员将于五月一日起领取应得的劳动保险费用。这是我国历史上空前的，也是人民民主专政的新中国在劳动政策上继工会法之后的又一个新的重要法案。
    我国工人阶级从一九二二年起即在中国共产党的领导下为争取实现劳动保险而奋斗了！三十年来前仆后继地终于建立起由工人阶级领导的新民主主义政权，实现了用奋斗争取来的劳动保险纲领。这种新的立法是用鲜血、头颅换来的革命胜利果实之一，因此劳动保险条例之实施，是中国工人阶级和全国人民的一件大喜事。
    劳动保险条例中规定由行政或资方按月缴纳相当于各该企业全部工人与职员工资总额的百分之三作为劳动保险金，比起苏联的百分之三·八到百分之一○·七的数字来固然不如，但与资本主义国家作为剥削方法之一的保险相比，确是优异而远远地超过了他们。况且目前受国家财政经济情况限制，很大一部分人尚过着艰苦的供给生活，能够如此，已是极不容易。那么实行了劳动保险条例，究竟解决了那些问题呢？
    首先，它解决了疾病、负伤与残废的问题。当工人与职员因工负伤时，其全部治疗费，药费，住院费，住院时的膳费与就医路费均由企业行政方面或资方负担。在医疗期间并照发工资，至确定为残废时，则按其轻重程度，从劳动保险基金项下，分别给以百分之七五、百分之六十的因工残废抚恤费，百分之五至百分之二十的因工残废补助费。
    疾病，非因工负伤时，在该企业的医疗机关治疗。其因无法治疗而转送其他医院的，除贵重药品，就医路费及住院膳费由本人自理外，亦由行政或资方负担。成为残废时除有其他经济来源可以维持生活外，则按工龄的长短给以百分之二十至百分之三十的救济费，直至死亡时止。非但如此，即工人与职员的亲属患有疾病除贵重药品，就医路费，住院费，住院时的膳费及其他一切费用由本人自理外，亦可享受在该企业的医疗机关或特约医院免费诊治与普通药费减半的待遇。
    其次，它解决了死亡及善后诸问题。因工死亡发给两个月额的该企业平均工资的丧葬费，并按照有条件的供养人数给以本人工资百分之二十五至百分之五十的供养亲属抚恤费。非因工负伤死亡或因工负伤成为残废而于退职后死亡时，给以该企业平均一个月额的丧葬补助费，并按工龄的长短给其家属以三至十二个月本人工资额的救济费。其因“养老”及“非因工残废完全丧失劳动力不能工作”退职后死亡时，给以该企业平均一个月工资数的丧葬补助费。直系亲属死亡按其年龄在“十周岁以上”及“一周岁以上十周岁以下”分别给以该企业一个月平均工资的“三分之一”及“四分之一”的丧葬补助费。
    这些问题，我们只要翻开老账对照一下便清清楚楚地明白了。这里引李立三部长在“关于草案的几点说明”中一个生动的例子来说明：“我的父亲在铁路上当小工，被火车压死了，买不起棺材，母亲带着我到局里叩头求告，才求得几块木板做棺材，半个钱的抚恤也没有。”
    第三，它解决了养老问题。我国古谚“养儿防老，积谷防饥”，是说明了在旧社会中“人到老年没有社会保障”和“上了年纪，劳动力减退后对于生活问题深加顾虑”的情况。在旧社会中，只有重重的压迫剥削，因而必然地产生出养老问题，甚至养老甚于死亡的问题。在旧社会中，假如“真的死了”那还好办，问题就怕“老而不死”，所谓“老而不死是为贼”，这句话就反映出旧社会的反动统治者是多么地讨厌老年人！
    劳动保险条例就解决了养老问题。在“男子满六十岁、工龄满二十五年，女子满五十岁，工龄满二十年，其本企业年龄又均满十年”的可以退休。每月并可享受“本人工资百分之三十五至百分之六十的养老补助费”直至死亡为止。如因工作需要而本人又同意留在岗位工作时，则除“应得工资”外，另得“百分之十至百分之二十的在职养老补助费”。此外，为了照顾在有害身体的环境下进行工作，条例中又规定：在井下、高温、低温气候或化学、兵工等有害身体健康之处工作者适当的缩短他们的退休年龄和工龄的计算方法。
    第四，它解决了妇女工作者的生育问题。条例中规定：“女工人与女职员生育，产前产后共给假五十六日，产假期间，工资照发。”并享受“生育补助费”。同时对产假期满仍不能工作者，亦与以适当的照顾。可以看出，人民政府在依照“按劳取酬”原则之外，为照顾妇女的生理特殊状态及保育第二代起见，又作这一特殊的合理的规定。
    第五，它解决了集体保险和优异享受的问题。条例中规定，将由中华全国总工会统筹举办“疗养所、残废院、养老院、孤儿保育院、休养所及其他”的集体保险事业。凡在实行劳动保险的各企业内的工人与职员均有权享受利益。在企业中有特殊贡献的“劳动模范”及转入之“战斗英雄”并有优先权利。同时，在“疾病”、“非因工负伤”、“因工负伤”、“残废”、“因工死亡供养直系亲属之抚恤费”及退职、在职之养老补助费上都有优异的规定。这些规定，反映了人民政府对于有功于人民国家的人民功臣是如何地尊重和照顾。
    劳动保险条例的实施，将解决企业、机关、学校中的职工们在生、老、病、死等问题上所发生的困难，但劳动保险事业，却是一种新的事业，因而对劳动保险条例必须深入地宣传，认真地学习，才能正确地把劳动保险工作作好，而使广大职工致力于生产和工作，以加强我们伟大祖国的经济力量和国防力量。
