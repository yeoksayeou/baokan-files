　　Record of the "Acupuncture Therapy" Symposium of the Central Ministry of Health
　　Bo Sheng

　　"Acupuncture therapy" has attracted the attention and importance of the Chinese medical community. In order to guide the research and experimentation of acupuncture therapy and exchange opinions on acupuncture therapy between Chinese and Western medicine, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government invited more than 20 Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in Beijing to hold a symposium on acupuncture therapy on the 7th.

　　Huang Dingchen, Director of the Medical Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Health, pointed out that acupuncture therapy is one of the important heritages of our country's medicine. It has a long history. Experiments have proved that it does have its unique effectiveness, and it has been widely promoted among the people. However, because it lacks systematic scientific research in terms of theory, although it has rich practical experience, it has not been summarized and refined with scientific theory. Today, under the leadership of the People's Government, due to the demands of the broad masses of the people, the government attaches great importance to the research work on acupuncture therapy, which has achieved certain results in practice.

　　At the meeting, both Chinese and Western medicine practitioners expressed many valuable opinions. Everyone agreed that the research work of acupuncture should be done seriously, and the unity of Chinese and Western medicine should be strengthened in this practical work, so that acupuncture therapy can be improved in scientific experiments and analysis, so as to give play to its contribution to Chinese medicine.

　　Chinese medicine practitioners Hu Yinpei, Gao Fengtong, Xie Huidong, Jiao Huiyuan and other doctors have been studying acupuncture for many years. They excitedly thanked the People's Government for its emphasis on the valuable heritage of Chinese medicine and its concern for the health of the people. Based on his own practical experience, Hu Yinpei described his opinions and feelings on acupuncture therapy. He said: In the past, we did not have the conditions to study and promote acupuncture therapy well. No one valued our work at that time. It is even more difficult to establish a scientific theory if Chinese and Western medicine are not united. But today, under the leadership of the People's Government, our acupuncture therapy can be combined with the scientific theories of Western medicine to further improve it. We should affirm the simplicity of acupuncture therapy and its unique effects on neurasthenia and other aspects. Some diseases that Western medicine cannot cure for a while have achieved good results after acupuncture is performed. He cited an engineer surnamed Sun and a patient from the Beijing Machine Factory who both suffered from joint diseases and were bedridden, but were later cured by his acupuncture therapy. Finally, he hoped that Western medicine can help them use scientific methods to check the changes in the patient's condition before and after acupuncture.

　　Chinese medicine practitioner Xie Huidong said: When it comes to acupuncture therapy, I think the main function of acupuncture is to activate the blood in the meridians. Acupuncture on nerve fibers stimulates local nerves, which can promote blood flow and promote metabolism. Moxibustion mainly uses mugwort leaves or ginger to burn the skin, absorb the moisture in the skin, and make the blood active. Moxibustion is simpler than acupuncture. They all have great effects in clinical treatment. He also talked about the fact that during the rule of the reactionary government, they only knew how to learn acupuncture by themselves. Although they had also run acupuncture training classes, they were not taken seriously, and there was no question of research, improvement and development. He hoped that every Chinese medicine practitioner will learn acupuncture in the future, and strive to study and promote it, and cooperate closely with Western medicine to relieve diseases for the people.

　　Then, several Western medicine practitioners Xu Yingkui, Liang Duo, Zhang Guangyan, Quan Ciguang, etc. also spoke successively, putting forward their opinions on acupuncture therapy. Dr. Xu Yingkui is a professor of the Department of Neurology of Peking University School of Medicine. He said that Peking University School of Medicine proposed to study acupuncture last year, but it has not been done until recently when the People's Daily published several articles on acupuncture in a row, which aroused the high attention of professors of the School of Medicine. He believes that acupuncture therapy is indeed worthy of attention in Chinese medicine; however, first of all, Chinese acupuncture experts should put forward rich clinical experience, so that medical colleagues can collect materials together, carefully study them, and then promote and apply them according to actual efficacy. In the process of research, Chinese and Western medicine can learn from each other. He also expressed his willingness to help Chinese medicine analyze and study acupuncture therapy with scientific theories. He said that there are many patients with nervous system diseases in the Western medicine clinic. If acupuncture therapy can be used in cooperation with Chinese medicine, it would be of great convenience. He believes that the method of inhibition, excitation, and induction of acupuncture pointed out by Comrade Zhu Lian in her article on acupuncture therapy is in line with Pavlov's principle of reflection. Regarding the anatomy of acupoints in acupuncture, he said that it is worth further study. He still has some doubts about what Comrade Zhu Lian said that acupuncture at a distance is stronger than acupuncture at the affected area for certain diseases. Regarding the direction of needle rotation, he believes that it should be determined according to the nerve state of the acupuncture site.

　　Liang Duo, a doctor of X-ray Department of Peking University School of Medicine, said: I have heard of acupuncture therapy before, but I don't understand its actual content. Recently, after reading the article about acupuncture therapy published in the People's Daily, I learned that Yang Xiurong, the patient with schizophrenia who was cured by acupuncture therapy, had undergone fluoroscopy in the X-ray Department of Peking University and was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the fourth lumbar vertebra. He hoped to study this patient carefully and take another X-ray after acupuncture therapy to see if the patient's bone tuberculosis has changed.

　　Zhang Guangyan, professor of the Department of Dentistry of Peking University School of Medicine, said: Past practice has proved to us that acupuncture has medical value, but we must still conduct in-depth research before promoting it today. I think it is even more necessary for us Chinese and Western medicine to have close contact and cooperation. He sincerely expressed his willingness to study acupuncture therapy hard. He said that there are many patients with trigeminal neuralgia in the dental clinic of Peking University Hospital. Although they have used alcohol injection or nerve resection and other therapies, they have failed to satisfy the patients, and they themselves are not satisfied. Because after the operation, the patient's face loses sensation and there is a possibility of recurrence. Therefore, he hopes to cooperate with Comrade Zhu Lian to treat trigeminal neuralgia patients with acupuncture, on the one hand, to analyze the condition in detail and cure the patients, and on the other hand, to study together.

　　After everyone spoke enthusiastically, Zhu Lian, Deputy Director of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Central Ministry of Health, who enthusiastically advocated acupuncture therapy, made a speech. She said that the government's convening of this meeting today shows that the government attaches importance to this work. As for herself, although she has done some acupuncture treatment, she has not been able to absorb a lot of experience because of the small scale. Today, the government attaches so much importance to this work, everyone should study it more deeply and analyze it scientifically. She said that since the acupuncture therapy was published in the newspaper, she has received 558 letters from readers in two weeks, which shows that acupuncture is valued by the broad masses of the people. The readers' letters generally believe that acupuncture therapy is economical and saves money, and should be seriously studied and promoted. Comrade Zhu Lian said: To do a good job in the research and improvement of acupuncture, Chinese and Western medicine must unite well and cooperate under the leadership of the government.

　　Finally, He Cheng, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Health, spoke. He said that everyone's emphasis on acupuncture therapy at today's meeting is a very correct attitude. He pointed out that acupuncture has been proven in practice to be one of the various medical therapies, whether it is the main treatment or the combination treatment, it has a certain efficacy. Therefore, it is needed by the broad masses of the people. But on the other hand, it has not yet been raised to the height of theory, and applied scientific methods to research and analysis. At the same time, due to the failure of many good acupuncture experiences to be passed down, and the overuse of acupuncture by some Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, it has not been able to obtain the medical status it deserves. He hoped that everyone must apply it prudently in the future, study and improve it well, especially to achieve cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, learn from each other, and help each other, so that acupuncture can be raised to a scientific level, have a scientific basis, and get the best development and true promotion and application. Finally, he emphasized that everyone should seriously pay attention to this research work. Both the Chinese Medicine Research Institute and Peking University School of Medicine should organize acupuncture research groups to conduct research. The Central Ministry of Health will also entrust Comrade Zhu Lian to be responsible for guiding and assisting, so that this valuable medical heritage of China can be well developed.

　　记中央卫生部“针灸疗法”座谈会
    柏生
    “针灸疗法”已引起中国医学界的注意与重视。中央人民政府卫生部为指导研究和实验针灸疗法，交换中西医对针灸疗法的意见，于七日邀请在京中西医二十余人举行了针灸疗法座谈会。
    中央卫生部医政局黄鼎臣局长首先指出：针灸疗法为我国医学上的重要遗产之一，已有很长的历史，在实验中证明，确实有它独特的效能，而且早在民间广泛推行。但因为它在学理上缺乏系统的科学研究，虽有丰富的实际经验，但一直没有用科学理论加以总结和提炼。今天，在人民政府的领导下，由于广大人民的要求，对这在实践中已经取得一定成效的针灸疗法的研究工作，政府是十分重视的。
    会上中西医都发表了许多宝贵的意见。大家一致认为应认真做好针灸的研究工作，在这一实际工作中加强中西医的团结，使针灸疗法在科学的实验与分析中得到提高，以发挥它对中国医学上的贡献。
    中医胡荫培、高凤桐、谢惠东、焦会元等大夫对针灸已有多年的研究，他们兴奋地感激人民政府对中国医学宝贵遗产的重视和对人民健康的关心。胡荫培根据自己的实际经验，述说了对针灸疗法的意见和感想。他说：过去我们没有条件来好好研究和推广针灸疗法。那时没有人重视我们的工作。中西医不团结，更难建立科学的理论。但今天在人民政府的领导下，我们的针灸疗法可以和西医的科学理论相结合，使它进一步的提高。我们应该肯定针灸疗法的简便和对神经性疼痛病等方面的特有功效。有些西医一时医不好的病症，施行针灸后，取得了良好的效果。他举出一个姓孙的工程师和北京机器厂一位病人都得了卧床不起的关节病，但后来经他施行针灸疗法，都医治好了。最后，他希望西医能帮助他们用科学的方法，在施行针灸前后，检查病人病情的变化。
    中医谢惠东说：谈到针灸疗法，我认为针的主要功能是活经血，针扎到神经纤维上，刺激局部神经，可以促进血液流动，起新陈代谢的作用。灸法主要是用艾叶或生姜来烧灼皮肤，吸去皮肤内的水分，使血液活动。而灸法比针法更简便些。它们在临床治疗上都有很大的功效。他又谈到过去在反动政府统治时期，他们只知自己学针灸，虽然也曾办过针灸速成班，但并未得到重视，谈不上研究提高和发展。他希望今后每一个中医都学会针灸，并且努力研究和推广，与西医密切合作，为老百姓解除疾病。
    接着，几位西医许英魁、梁铎、张光炎、全慈光等也相继发言，提出他们对针灸疗法的意见。许英魁大夫是北大医学院神经系的教授，他说去年北大医学院就提出要研究针灸，但一直没有做到，直到最近人民日报一连发表了几篇有关针灸的文章后，才引起了医学院教授的高度注意。他认为针灸疗法的确是中国医学上值得十分重视的；不过首先应该请中医针灸专家提出丰富的临床经验，以便医学界同仁共同收集材料，认真加以研究，然后再根据实际效能推广应用。在研究过程中，中西医可以互相学习。他并表示十分愿意帮助中医用科学理论来分析研究针灸疗法。他说在西医门诊部中看神经系统病症的病人很多，如能够与中医合作使用针灸疗法，那是很大的方便。他对朱琏同志关于针灸疗法的文章中所指出的针治的制止法、兴奋法、诱导法，他认为这是合乎巴夫洛夫的反射原理的。对于针灸学中关于穴位的解剖，他说这是值得做进一步的研究的。对于朱琏同志说的某些疾病在远处施针比在疾患处施针作用强这一点，他还有些怀疑。对于转针的方向，他认为是要根据施针处的神经状态如何而决定的。
    北京大学医学院Ｘ光科梁铎大夫说：以前也听到过针灸疗法，但不懂得它的实际内容。最近看到人民日报刊登的关于针灸疗法的文章后，知道那位被针灸疗法医好精神分裂症的病人杨秀容，曾在北大Ｘ光科进行过透视，被判断为第四腰椎体结核。他希望把这个病人认真研究一下，施针灸疗法后，能再照一次Ｘ光，看看病人的骨结核是否起了变化。
    北京大学医学院牙学系教授张光炎说：已往的实践向我们证明，针灸是有医疗的价值的，但今天在推广之前。我们一定还要深入的研究。我觉得我们中西医更有密切连系合作的必要。他诚恳地表示愿意努力研究针灸疗法。他说在北大医院牙科门诊部里，有许多三叉神经痛患者，虽然经过他们施用酒精注射或神经切除等疗法，但未能使患者满意，他们自己也不满意。因为在施手术后，患者面部失去知觉，而且有复发的可能。因此他希望与朱琏同志合作，为三叉神经痛患者作针灸治疗，一方面可详细分析病情，医好病人，一方面也可共同研究。
    大家热烈发言后，热心提倡针灸疗法的中央卫生部妇幼卫生局副局长朱琏发表了谈话。她说，今天政府召开这个会，表明了政府是重视这个工作的。至于她自己，虽作了一些针灸治疗，但因为规模小，未能吸收很多的经验。今天政府这样重视这工作，大家就要更深入的研究，并加以科学的分析。她说自针灸疗法在报纸上发表后，两个星期中她已接到五百五十八封读者来信，由此可见针灸被广大群众所重视。读者来信中大致认为针灸疗法经济省钱，应该认真加以研究与推广。朱琏同志说：要做好针灸的研究与提高工作，中西医必须很好的团结起来，在政府的领导下，分工合作。
    最后，中央卫生部贺诚副部长发言。他说今天会上大家一致重视针灸疗法，这是极正确的态度。他指出针灸在实践中已证明是各种医学疗法中的一种，不论是主治或配合治疗，都曾有一定的效能。因此为广大人民所需要。但另一方面，它还没有提高到理论的高度，应用科学方法来研究分析。同时由于过去许多好的针灸经验不能留传，以及某些中西医的泛用针灸，使它没有能得到应有的医学地位。他希望今后大家必须审慎应用，很好地研究提高，特别要做到中西医合作，互相学习，互相帮助，才能使针灸提高到科学的水平，有科学的根据，得到最好的发展与真正的推广和应用。最后他着重指出，要大家认真重视这一研究工作。不论中医研究所或北大医学院都应组织针灸研究小组进行研究。中央卫生部也将委托朱琏同志负责指导辅助，使中国这一宝贵医学遗产得到很好的发扬。
