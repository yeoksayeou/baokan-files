Column: Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Beijing General Labor Union Seventh District Office
    Self-Criticism Regarding Failure to Actively Support Worker Li Yuliang
    Comrades Editors:
    The People's Daily published an article by Comrade Li Yuliang titled "Why Did Jianxing Construction Firm Fire Me?" on December 23rd of last year. The editor's note stated: "The Seventh District Labor Union disregarded the worker's opinion and failed to actively support the worker, causing the problem to drag on for five months without resolution." The course of events was as follows: Comrade Li Yuliang was hired by Jianxing Construction Firm to work at the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters on July 3rd of last year. When he discovered that workers were sawing purlins, he protested to the foreman of the firm. On July 6th, he reported this situation to the Seventh Branch of the Construction Workers' Union. On July 8th, the branch committee sent cadre Wang Zhixiang to investigate. Chu Shuzhong, chairman of the Construction Branch, reported this issue to the Municipal General Labor Union's Construction Workers' Union on July 19th. Thereafter, the issue was directly negotiated and handled by the Municipal General Labor Union's Construction Workers' Union and Jianxing Construction Firm.
    Our self-criticism on this matter is: Although we immediately sent someone to the site to investigate after hearing Li Yuliang's report, we only reported it to the Municipal General Labor Union's Construction Workers' Union after the matter was verified, and we did not report it to the Municipal General Labor Union ourselves. There was also a delay of seven days in between. This shows that we did not pay enough attention to this matter ideologically. Secondly, although we assisted during the direct handling process by the Municipal General Labor Union's Construction Workers' Union, we did not offer active suggestions. This further proves that there is serious bureaucratism in our work, and we should indeed conduct a profound self-criticism.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    北京市总工会七区办事处
    对未积极支持工人李玉良的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报去年十二月二十三日刊载李玉良同志的《建兴营造厂为什么解雇我》一文，其中编者按语称：“七区工会漠视工人意见，未积极支持工人，因而使问题拖延了五个月尚未解决。”查事情经过是这样：去年七月三日李玉良同志被建兴营造厂雇到防疫总队作活，当他发现工人锯檩时，即向该厂工头提出抗议。七月六日他并将这一情况反映到建筑业工会七区分会。七月八日，分会委员会即派干部王致祥前往调查；建筑业分会主席褚寿仲并于七月十九日将这个问题报告给市总工会建筑业工会，此后问题遂由市总工会建筑业工会与建兴营造厂直接交涉处理。
    我们对这件事的检讨是：我们听到李玉良的反映后，虽曾立即派人到现场调查，但当事情证实后，只反映给市总工会建筑业工会，并未亲自向市总工会汇报，其间并拖延了七天之久。这说明我们对这件事情思想上重视不够。其次，当市总工会建筑业工会直接处理过程中，我们虽加以协助，但并未提出积极的建议。这就更证明我们工作上存在着严重的官僚主义，确实应当深刻检讨。
