Academician Filatov's Great Contributions to Medicine
   ——Celebrating Filatov's Seventy-Sixth Birthday
    Ge Shaolong
    Academician Filatov celebrated his seventy-sixth birthday on February 28th. He is a world authority on ophthalmology and was the first to complete the surgical method of corneal transplantation, performing the most surgeries. Many blind patients have been cured by his surgery, and the completion of this method means that most blind people can be saved in the future. This is an immortal achievement in academics.
    Academician Filatov, in his research on methods of treating blindness, finally made a major new discovery: tissue therapy. Recently, two or three places in New China have utilized tissue therapy and achieved amazing results. In the exchange of Chinese and Soviet culture, especially in science, this is a very gratifying thing. Therefore, on the occasion of his seventy-sixth birthday, I will give a brief introduction to his attitude towards life and his scientific achievements.
    Filatov's father was a village doctor. After Filatov decided to study medicine, he soon chose ophthalmology as his lifelong specialty. He was greatly influenced by his father in making this decision, as his father had instilled in him an interest in ophthalmology from an early age. After graduating from university, he was very fond of the profession of ophthalmology specialist he had chosen. Originally, among the various specialties in medicine, there was often a tendency to think that surgery and internal medicine were more important and complex subjects, while ophthalmology was regarded as a secondary subject. Or some people even thought that physiology, biochemistry, anatomy, etc., were of greater significance. But Filatov, after graduating from university and becoming a young ophthalmologist, all the way to becoming the most famous ophthalmology expert in the world, always valued the profession of ophthalmology and devoted all his efforts to its development. He once said:
    "Don't say that there are beautiful trees growing over there, with strange fruits hanging, decorated with various mathematical formulas in splendid beauty, so they should be regarded as real science. It is true that the sciences of our neighbors, such as physiology and morphology, seem very beautiful and fruitful when studying the eye and other parts. But you cannot think that the science of ophthalmologists is narrow. Physiologists take a different route and can master their own specialty, but that is all they can do. When they do research, they use higher mathematics to deeply charm you, but can they make the blind see the light of day again? To you, ophthalmology seems narrow, so you want to seek a broader field of scientific research. However, is there anything more important than the task of making the blind see the light again?"
    He gave this advice to his students, because some people often hold feelings of envy for the success of others in other fields.
    Filatov held this belief and expressed this opinion in his writing and speaking. He was convinced that this did not violate the truth. He was faithful to this belief and also possessed a spirit of courage and enthusiasm to overcome many difficulties in specialized research. Because of this strong and unyielding spirit to pursue the realization of his goals, he finally completed the technology of corneal transplantation in ophthalmology, became one of the greatest ophthalmology experts in the world (perhaps the number one ophthalmology expert in the world today), greatly increased the happiness of blind people around the world, and also won great honor for Soviet science, which proves the correctness of his academic research approach.
    Filatov's greatest achievement in science is the completion of the method of treating pterygium. Originally, the part commonly called the black eyeball is anatomically called the cornea, and the center of the cornea is where the pupil is located. If a part of the cornea becomes cloudy due to various diseases, such as corneal ulcer, trachoma, smallpox, or other diseases, then so-called pterygium white spots are formed. If pterygium grows on the pupil, the patient will become blind. The number of people in the world who are blinded by this is very large.
    More than 130 years ago, German ophthalmologists had already advocated removing pterygium and creating an artificial corneal pupil. However, these first few decades were an experimental period, that is, using animal corneas as transplantation materials. It was not until 1905 that the German doctor Zirm reported a successful example of using human corneal transplantation. In 1908, Professor Elschnig of Czechoslovakia began to study this problem and achieved considerable success. By 1931, Professor Elschnig and his school had performed this surgery 203 times, with 31 successful cases.
    Filatov began his work on corneal transplantation in 1913. But it was not until after the October Revolution that his research made active gains. From 1922 to 1950, Filatov and his school performed more than 1,700 corneal transplants, which is more than the number of corneal transplants performed in all countries of the world for a century. At the same time, we must remember that in the Soviet Union, in addition to this surgery performed by Filatov himself and his students, other Soviet experts performed corneal transplants 1,500 times, which means that the total number of surgeries performed in the Soviet Union reached 3,200, which is almost twice the sum of the number of such surgeries performed in all countries of the world.
    Filatov has made some significant contributions to the completion of corneal transplantation technology. First, is the improvement of instruments used for corneal transplantation. According to Academician Filatov himself, he spent a lot of effort to improve surgical instruments. After thinking about it for thirteen years, he one day accidentally came up with a new instrument on the tram, which is the Filatov-style trephine, which is a relatively safer surgical instrument. Second, when using instruments to remove pterygium, there is often a great risk that a transparent substance inside the eyeball called the vitreous body will flow out, and the surgery is bound to fail. Filatov came up with a surgical method that can prevent the vitreous body from escaping, which is also a major advancement. Third, after years of painstaking thought and experimentation, Filatov solved a very significant problem in corneal transplantation, which is the use of cadaver corneas as transplantation materials. Originally, when corneal transplantation was performed, it was necessary to wait for patients who needed to have their eyeballs removed due to eye diseases, and after surgery, the cornea of the removed eyeball was taken and transplanted to patients with pterygium. This opportunity was very rare, which is obvious. Filatov then decided to use cadaver corneas as transplantation materials. The initial surgeries also had many difficulties, but they were subsequently successful, and thus the problem of transplantation materials was solved. Because Filatov overcame these difficulties in technology and materials, corneal transplantation truly became an effective method for ophthalmologists to use in practice. His academic achievements have had a great impact on European and American specialists, so he can be regarded as the first person to complete corneal transplantation among ophthalmology specialists in the world. Countless people have been directly or indirectly treated by his methods and made to see the light of day again, which is a great contribution to science. What we need to pay more attention to is that due to the completion of corneal transplantation, Filatov has made an even more important scientific discovery, which is tissue therapy.
    How was tissue therapy discovered? Filatov's discovery of this therapy was also due to his keen observation and solid research heart. After performing corneal transplantation, the cloudiness (i.e., pterygium) in the surrounding part of the transplanted part would gradually disappear, especially if the transplanted material used for the pupil part had been refrigerated (two degrees above zero). The cloudiness around the transplanted part disappeared quickly. It is obvious that after the cornea taken from the corpse has been refrigerated, after being supplied to the transplantation operation, not only can it itself replace the original cloudy part, but it also has a therapeutic effect on the still existing cloudy part around it, so that the cloudy part can also be restored to light. What is the thing that exerts this therapeutic effect, this is the initial question of the discovery of tissue therapy.
    In order to solve this problem, Filatov did a lot of diagnosis and treatment experiments, and finally proved that this therapeutic substance exists, and thus got the discovery of tissue therapy. What is worth our attention is that the fact that the original cloudy part around the cornea would also heal after transplantation was a well-known fact long ago, but as Filatov said, strangely, no one had ever paid special attention to it. Only Filatov paid attention to this meaningful fact, and successively did many experiments, thus becoming the foundation for the discovery of tissue therapy, so it can be seen that for any phenomenon in nature, we need keen observation and a persevering research heart, which is an important condition for the success of invention and discovery.
    Filatov had already published a report in 1933, explaining the effectiveness of using tissue therapy. In 1934, he began to use refrigerated cadaver corneas not only to treat corneas that had already become cloudy, but also to treat other eye diseases. This attempt also had a huge effect. Later, Filatov had a new idea, wanting to use this method to treat diseases of other parts of the body, especially skin diseases. This attempt also achieved amazing effects. Here is an example:
    Figures 1 and 2 above are photographs of a patient's right hand. The first picture is the back of the right hand. The patient's palms and backs of hands all had tuberculous ulcers, which had been treated for many years without effect. Filatov transplanted refrigerated cadaver skin under the patient's forearm skin. After inoculation. All the ulcers closed quickly. The second picture is the fully healed back of the patient's hand three months after tissue therapy.
    Due to a large number of clinical diagnoses, treatments and experimental results, Filatov came to a conviction that: 1. The tissue and material used for tissue treatment can be any tissue of humans or animals; 2. The tissue material used does not need to be anatomically the same as the diseased tissue; 3. The tissue used for treatment does not necessarily need to be transplanted near the diseased part; 4. If the tissue material used is refrigerated, its effect is greater than the effect of fresh tissue.
    Due to the results of various experimental studies, Filatov came to a very important conclusion: any tissue, when in the refrigerator, is subject to conditions that are extremely unfavorable to tissue survival. For example, a cut piece of tissue in the refrigerator cannot receive the nourishment of blood like it does in a living organism, and low temperature also has a great obstacle effect on the tissue piece. As is well known, the cells in a small piece of skin or a small piece of muscle do not die instantly when the tissue piece is cut off from the human body or animal body, but still maintain vitality for a certain period of time. When this tissue is refrigerated, it is affected by the adverse conditions of cold and lack of nutrients, and in order to maintain survival, it will produce a special substance that has the ability to continue to maintain survival. Filatov called this substance biogenic stimulant, that is: this is a stimulant originating from biology, which stimulates biological tissue under adverse conditions to prolong life. At the same time, Filatov also called this hypothetical substance resistin, which means a substance that resists all conditions that are unfavorable to the survival of biological tissue.
    Filatov said: Transplanting fresh tissue into the bodies of animals and humans can also show a therapeutic effect. Because fresh tissue, after being cut off from an animal, even for a short time, is already under unfavorable conditions, it will cause the production of biogenic stimulants; if such fresh tissue is transplanted into another person or animal body, it will have a therapeutic effect; but to repeat, the therapeutic effect of this fresh tissue is far less than the therapeutic effect of refrigerated tissue. It can be imagined that under refrigerated conditions, the tissue produces a larger amount of biogenic stimulants for this unfavorable condition of cold, so it has a greater therapeutic effect.
    What needs more attention is that after the refrigerated tissue is soaked in water, this biogenic stimulant also exists in the leachate, so subcutaneous injection with this leachate has the same effect as transplantation with the tissue itself.
    Filatov further studied whether the same biogenic stimulants could be produced in plant tissue. He took plant leaves, such as aloe leaves, and placed them in the dark, because the important conditions for the perfect survival of leaves are the combined action of chlorophyll and sunlight. After the leaves are taken off and placed in a dark place, this is a condition that is not conducive to the survival of the leaves. After various plant leaves placed in the dark are extracted with water, biogenic stimulants also exist in the leachate, so this leachate also has the effect of treating diseases, and this therapeutic effect is stronger than the leachate of plant leaves that have not been placed in the dark.
    Due to these research data, Filatov came to a very important conclusion, that is, all living tissues (human, animal, plant), after being separated from the individual, if placed under unfavorable conditions, if the unfavorable conditions are not destructive to the tissue, then biochemical changes will occur, forming special substances, that is, forming the so-called biogenic stimulants. If these biogenic stimulants are introduced into other biological individuals by methods such as transplantation or injection, they will stimulate the vitality of the organism and strengthen the vitality.
    When used in actual medical treatment, the tissue containing biogenic stimulants is either transplanted under the patient's skin, or the leachate containing biogenic stimulants is injected under the patient's skin. The sources of these materials can be distinguished as follows:
    A. Various different tissues of the human body, such as cornea, vitreous body, sclera, retina, optic nerve, crystalline lens, skin, subcutaneous tissue, spleen, liver, peritoneum, cartilage, bone, muscle, bone marrow, testicles, nerves, placenta, etc. These tissues are either obtained during surgery, such as skin and peritoneum, or taken from corpses, or obtained from the patients themselves.
    These tissues obtained from animals can also be used for treatment in the same way.
    The refrigeration time and disinfection of these materials, as well as the transplantation method, are omitted for the time being.
    B. Use biological tissue to make leachate for injection. Many tissues are used for leachate production, such as 1. Human placenta, 2. Cadaver skin, testicles, muscles, bone marrow, peritoneum, etc., 3. Animal tissues, such as skin, nerves, bone marrow, testicles, peritoneum, crystalline lens, etc. of cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits, 4. Plants, such as aloe leaves, agave, plantain, beet stems, etc., are stored in a dark place for a certain period of time before being made into leachate for use.
    C. Liquid substances in living organisms, such as cadaveric (human or animal) crystalline lens, human or animal myelitis, human blood, etc., are refrigerated and disinfected before use.
    The use of tissue therapy, Filatov initially used tissue therapy to treat eye diseases, with remarkable results. He has successively published many reports on the application of this method to treat ophthalmology. For keratitis, myopic choroiditis, optic nerve atrophy, pigmentary retinitis, trachomatous pannus, crystalline lens turbidity, there are thousands of cases, most of which can be effective. Later, Filatov used this method outside of ophthalmology for other types of diseases, and it was also quite successful. In his report last year (1950), he cited lupus, tuberculous skin ulcers, cicatricial stenosis (esophagus, urethra), cutaneous Leishmaniasis, scleroderma, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, eczema, peripheral neuritis, bronchial asthma, gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers, chronic gynecological inflammation, post-traumatic joint immobility, incomplete fracture healing, spontaneous gangrene, spotted fever, Brucella neuritis, syphilitic gumma, pellagra, epilepsy, schizophrenia, pediatric diseases and hypertension, etc.
    It should be noted that Filatov once pointed out that this method must be applied with special care for laryngeal tuberculosis and pulmonary tuberculosis. At first, a small amount of tissue leachate (0.1 to 0.2) was injected, and the dose was gradually increased. After a long period of preparation for injection, transplantation can be used, otherwise it is not appropriate.
    Filatov's tissue therapy is undoubtedly an important discovery in therapeutic medicine. In 1950, the Surgical Research Institute of the Academy of Medical Sciences, the highest medical research institution in the Soviet Union, because it was ordered by the Soviet government to re-evaluate the efficacy of Filatov's tissue therapy, published a report. The report only included 207 patients with various different diseases, and the results obtained were somewhat different from the results reported by Filatov himself, but the number of patients treated with tissue therapy by the Surgical Research Institute was very small, and a considerable number of patients also achieved considerable results.
    Since 1933, when Filatov published tissue therapy, it has been sixteen years. Now tissue therapy is used in more than 150 cities and villages in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Socialist Republic, and the Ministry of Health of the Ukrainian Republic all support the promotion of tissue therapy. In 1948, the Ministry of Health of the Ukrainian Republic organized a special committee on tissue therapy to pay special attention to the research and promotion of this issue. Filatov himself was awarded the Stalin First Class Prize for his achievements in the discovery of tissue therapy.
    Tissue therapy has been implemented in several places in New China, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. In Shanghai, surgeons Qiu Fazhu and Tong Erchang of Tongji University Hospital have begun to use tissue therapy to treat hundreds of patients with various diseases, and ophthalmologists Chen Qian and Liang have used this method to treat nearly 100 patients with eye diseases. The Shanghai Railway Hospital has also recently used this method to treat more than 40 patients with various diseases. Because the time of starting tissue therapy is not long, the number of patients treated is still very small, so it is impossible to make a very general conclusion, but some cases have had special effects. For example, here are one or two examples from the report of the Department of Surgery of Tongji University Hospital:
    1. Patient Wang Zhiqiang, 22 years old, worker, developed ulcers on his lower leg after being injured two years ago. He was first treated in Hongren Hospital for more than a month, and then in Tongji University Hospital for more than three months, but all were ineffective. Last September, skin was cut from the patient's thigh and used as a material for tissue therapy, transplanted to the ulcerated part of the lower leg, and it closed completely in only two weeks.
    2. Patient Wei Shihuang, 23 years old, worker. In mid-November last year, his right forearm was injured by a machine. A part of the wound left a large scar, and a part still did not close for a long time. He had undergone two normal surgical skin grafts in Hangzhou without success. When he was treated at Tongji, his right forearm could only bend to 160 degrees. On January 9 this year, he received tissue therapy (refrigerated spleen) at Tongji Hospital. Three days later, his forearm could be fully straightened and could perform an 180-degree movement. All the surgeons in the hospital were amazed and increased their confidence in tissue therapy.
    The Department of Surgery of Tongji University used this method to treat more than 50 patients with asthma. After the operation, more than two-thirds of the patients had significant effects. Other cases such as urethral stricture and postoperative intestinal obstruction have also been treated with this method with good results. After ophthalmology patients are treated with this method, most of the results are very satisfactory. For example, it is very effective for trachomatous pannus, iridocyclitis, glandular keratitis, optic nerve atrophy, retrobulbar optic neuritis, etc.
    The Department of Ophthalmology of Shanghai Railway Hospital treated about 40 patients with eye diseases with tissue therapy, and also achieved great results. There have also been reports in Tianjin proving the effectiveness of tissue therapy for eye diseases.
    Although only about 300 patients have used tissue therapy in China, the effect of this therapy has proven that it is necessary to promote it on a large scale. The advantages of this method are its simplicity and wide range of treatment. From a medical point of view, it is worth further application and research.
    Academician Filatov has made great achievements in medicine. The corneal transplantation and tissue therapy mentioned in this article are just a very simple introduction to his most important contributions. He has reached the age of seventy-six this year, and he is still working tirelessly to seek progress in Soviet science. He receives immense respect and honor in the Soviet Union. There are two films about his corneal transplantation, one is "Corneal Transplantation" and the other is "Return to Light", which won a prize at the Czech International Film Competition.
    Academician Filatov's contribution to medicine is so great, of course, due to his talent and efforts, but the biggest factor for success is due to the Soviet government's emphasis on science and encouragement of science. He only published 12 research papers before the revolution, while he has published more than 250 papers after the October Revolution. In a socialist country, the future of a patriotic scientist is always broad and magnificent. This is a proof. Academician Filatov, his school, and other Soviet ophthalmology experts performed more than 3,200 corneal transplants last year, which is almost twice the number of similar surgeries performed by the entire Europe and the United States. This shows how easily science can develop in socialist countries.
    At the end of this article, I would like to wish Academician Filatov a long and healthy life, to promote his research on tissue therapy, and at the same time hope that the colleagues in the medical field of our country in the Mao Zedong era will learn from Academician Filatov's continuous efforts in medicine for more than 50 years, improve the level of medicine in New China, and serve the people of the motherland.

　　费拉托夫院士在医学上的伟大贡献
   ——祝费拉托夫七十六岁诞辰
    戈绍龙
    费拉托夫院士于二月二十八日过他的七十六岁生日。他是世界眼科学的权威，在角膜移植术方面，是完成手术方法的第一人，所做的手术也最多。许多盲目的病人都受了他的手术而能治愈，并且该方法的完成，使盲人将来大部分都可以获救，这是学术上一种不朽的业绩。
    费拉托夫院士在研究医治盲目的方法的时候，终于得到一个重大的新发现。这就是组织疗法。新中国最近已有两三处地方，利用组织疗法而获得惊人的效果，在中苏文化的交流上，特别在科学方面，这是一件很可喜的事情。因此在他的七十六岁高寿的今日，关于他的生活态度和科学上的成绩，作一简单的介绍。
    费拉托夫的父亲是一个乡村医生。当费拉托夫决心研究医学以后，不久就选定眼科做他的终身专门事业。他在决定以前，很受了他父亲的影响，因为他父亲老早就使他对于眼科发生了兴味。他在大学毕业以后，非常喜爱他所选择的眼科专家的职业。本来在医科各专门之中，往往有一个倾向，就是以为外科内科是比较重大而复杂的科目，而把眼科当做次要的科目。或者更有些人，以为生理学，生物化学，解剖学等等更具有重大的意义。但是费拉托夫在大学卒业以后，成为一个青年的眼科医生，一直到以后成为全世界最有名的眼科专家止，他始终是重视眼科这个职业，而尽全力以使眼科发展的。他曾经说过：
    “你们不要说，在那边长着美丽的树木，悬着奇异的果实，有数学的种种公式装饰得辉煌美观，所以应该当做真正的科学看待。不错，我们邻人的科学，如生理学和形态学等等，在研究眼及其他部分的时候，似乎是非常美丽而富于成果的。可是不能以为眼科医生的科学是狭窄的。生理学者们走着另外一个路线，能够掌握他们自己的专门，可是他们只能这样做。他们做研究的时候，应用高等数学，使你们深受魅惑，可是他们能使盲人重见天日吗？对于你们，眼科似乎是狭窄的，因此想寻觅科学研究更广大的天地。然而比盲人重见光明的任务，有更重要的事情吗？”
    他对于他的学生做过这样忠告，因为有些人对于他人在其他方面的成功，往往是抱着羡慕之情的。
    费拉托夫抱了这种信仰，在写作和说话的时候，都发表这样意见。他确信着，这是不违反真理的。他忠实于这个信念，同时还具有勇往迈进的热情，以克服专门研究上许多的困难。因为有这种坚强不屈的精神，以求目的的贯彻，所以他终于在眼科学方面，完成角膜移植术的技术，成为全世界眼科最大专家之一（也许是现在全世界眼科的第一人），为全世界盲人增进了莫大的幸福，并且也为苏联的科学争取了绝大的名誉，就可以证明他的学问研究方针的正确了。
    费拉托夫在科学上的最大成绩，就是医治眼翳方法的完成。本来，普通所谓黑眼珠的部分，在解剖学上就叫做角膜，角膜的中心是瞳孔所在的地方。如果角膜的一部分，因为种种的疾病，譬如因为角膜溃疡，砂眼，天花或其他疾病而发生溷浊的时候，就生成所谓眼翳的白斑。如果瞳孔部分生翳，病人就会失明。全世界上因此而失明的人的数字是很大的。
    在一百三十余年前，德国眼科医生已经主张除去眼翳而造成人工的角膜瞳孔部。不过这最初数十年内是一种实验时期，就是说：用动物的角膜，做移植的材料。直到一九○五年德国医生澈尔姆才报告一个利用人的角膜移植而成功的例子。在一九○八年捷克爱儿须尼格教授着手于这个问题的研究而获得相当的成功。到一九三一年止，爱儿须尼格教授及其学派做这种手术二百零三例，其中成功的例子是三十一。
    费拉托夫从一九一三年就开始做角膜移植术的工作。但在十月革命以后，他的研究才有积极的收获。从一九二二年起至一九五○年止，费拉托夫及其学派所施行的角膜移植术共一千七百个以上，这就比百年以来全世界各国所做的角膜移植术的数字，还要多一些。同时我们要记着，在苏联，费拉托夫本人及其学生所做的这种手术以外，还有其他苏联专家所施行的角膜移植术一千五百次，就是说，在苏联所做的手术，总共达到三千二百的数字，这几乎等于全世界各国所做的这种手术数字的总和的两倍。
    费拉托夫在角膜移植术的技术完成方面，有一些重大的贡献。第一，是角膜移植用的器械的改良。据费拉托夫院士自己的话，他为手术器械改良，费尽种种苦心。考虑了十三年，有一天偶然在电车上想出一种新的器械，就是费拉托夫式的穿凿器，这是比较最安全的手术器械。第二，在用器械除去眼翳的时候，往往有一个很大的危险，就是眼球内部一种叫做玻璃体的透明物质，会流出来，因而手术就必定失败。费拉托夫想出了一种手术方法，可以预防玻璃体的冲出，这也是很大的一种进步。第三，费拉托夫多年苦心思素和实验的结果，解决了角膜移植术的一个极重大的问题，就是用尸体的角膜做移植的材料。本来，在角膜移植术施行的时候，必须等候有因为眼病而需要将眼球摘出的病人，在手术后，采取其被摘出的眼球的角膜，移植于有眼翳的病人，这种机会很为稀少，是显然易见的。费拉托夫于是决心利用尸体的角膜做移植的材料。最初的这种手术，也有许多困难，但以后陆续成功，于是移植材料，才不发生问题。由于费拉托夫在技术上和材料上，克服了这些困难，角膜移植术才真正成为眼科医师实际上应用有效的办法。他的学术上的成绩，对于欧美专门家的影响很大，因此他在世界眼科专门家里，可以算是完成角膜移植术的第一人。直接间接地受他的方法处置而使盲人重见天日者极多，这是他对于科学上很大的一个贡献。我们更需要注意的是，由于角膜移植术的完成，费拉托夫更得到一个重要的科学上的发现，这就是组织疗法。
    组织疗法是怎样发现的？费拉托夫发现这个疗法，也是由于他观察力的锐敏和研究心的坚固而成功的。在施行角膜移植术以后，移植部周围部分的溷浊（即翳）也会渐渐消失，特别是，如果所用的瞳孔部移植材料，受过冷藏（零度上两度）的时候，移植部周围的溷浊的消失很快。显而易见的，由尸体取下的角膜经过冷藏以后，在供给于移植手术以后，不但它本身可以代替原有的溷浊部分，并且对于周围依然存在的溷浊部分，都具有一种治疗的作用，所以使溷浊部分也恢复光明。发挥这种治疗作用的东西是什么，这就是组织疗法发现的初步问题。
    费拉托夫为了解决这问题，就做了极多的诊疗实验，终于证明这种治疗性物质是存在的，因而就得到组织疗法的发现。值得我们注意的，在角膜移植以后周围原有溷浊部分也会痊可的事实，本是老早周知的事实，但正如费拉托夫说过的，很奇怪地，无人曾经对此加以特别的注意。只有费拉托夫注意于这富于意义的事实，陆续做许多实验，因而成为发现组织疗法的基础，所以可见对于自然界的任何现象，我们需要锐敏的观察和坚忍的研究心，这是发明和发现的成功的重要条件。
    费拉托夫在一九三三年已经发表一个报告，说明利用组织疗法的有效。在一九三四年开始利用于冷藏尸体角膜，不但医治已经溷浊的角膜，而且医治眼科其他的疾病。这个尝试也发生很巨大的效果。以后费拉托夫更有了一个新的想法，想用这个方法治疗身体其他部分的疾病，特别是皮肤病。这个尝试又获得了惊人的奇效。试举一例如下：
    上图１和２，是一个病人右手的照相。第一图是右手背，该病人的手掌和手背都生了结核性溃疡，医治多年无效。费拉托夫用冷藏尸体皮肤移植于病人前手膀皮下。接种以后。溃疡的全部收口很快。第二图，是该病人经过组织疗法三个月以后手背完全治愈的情形。
    由于大量临床诊疗和实验的结果，费拉托夫得到一个确信，就是：一，用于组织治疗的组织，材料，可以采取人类或动物的任何组织；二，所用的组织材料，在解剖学上，并不需要与有病的组织相同；三，该医疗用的组织，并不一定需要移植于有病部分的附近；四，所用的组织材料，如果是冷藏的，其效力比新鲜组织的效力还更大。
    由于种种实验研究的结果，费拉托夫得到一个很重要的结论：任何一种组织，在冰箱里的时候，受着极不利于组织生存的条件。譬如一片切下的组织，在冰箱里，就不能像在生物体中接受血液的营养，并且低温对于该组织片也有很大的障碍的影响。众所周知的，一块皮肤小片或肌肉小片里的细胞并非在该组织片从人体或动物体切离的瞬间就即刻死亡，而是依然保持生活力若干时间的。这种组织在冷藏的时候，受了寒冷和营养质缺乏的不良条件的影响，为了保持生存起见，就会产生一种特别的物质，具有继续保持生存的能力。这种物质，费拉托夫称为生物原性刺激素，就是说：这是起源于生物的一种刺激素，是对于不利条件下的生物组织，加以刺激，以延长生命的一种物质。同时费拉托夫又把这种假定的物质，叫做抵抗素，这就意味着一种生物组织抵抗一切不利于生存条件的物质。
    费拉托夫说：用新鲜的组织移植于动物和人的身体内，也能够显出治疗的作用。因为新鲜的组织从动物被切离以后，即使是短时间，也已经是在一种不利的条件之下，所以会引起生物原性刺激素的产生；如果这样的新鲜组织被移植于其他的一个人或动物体内，就会发生治疗作用；可是重复地说：这种新鲜组织所具有的治疗作用，远远不及于冷藏组织的治效作用之大。可以想象，在冷藏的条件之下，组织对于这寒冷的不利条件，更加产生大量生物原性刺激素，所以具有更大的治疗作用。
    更需要注意的，冷藏组织用水浸过以后，在浸出液中也有这种生物原性刺激素的存在，所以用该浸出液做皮下注射，就具有与用该组织本身移植相同的效果。
    费拉托夫以后更进一步研究，要证明在植物组织里，能否有同样生物原性刺激素的产生。他把植物，譬如芦荟的叶子取下，放置于黑暗之中，因为叶子的完美生存的重要条件是叶绿素和太阳光线的共同作用。叶子取下以后，放置在黑暗的地方，这就是一种不利于叶子生存的条件。在黑暗中放置以后的种种植物的叶子，用水浸出后在其浸出液中，也有生物原性刺激素的存在，所以这种浸出液也具有治疗疾病的作用，并且这种治疗作用比不曾放置于黑暗中的植物叶子的浸出液还更强。
    由于这些研究的资料，费拉托夫得到一个很重要的结论，就是一切活的组织（人的，动物的，植物的），从该个体分离以后，如果被放置于不利的条件之下，如果该不利条件并非对于该组织是毁灭性的，就会发生生物化学的变化，构成特殊的物质，即构成所谓生物原性刺激素。如果将这种生物原性刺激素用移植或注射等等的方法，引入于其他生物的个体里，就会刺激该生物的生活力，使生活力加强。
    利用于实际医疗的时候，或者把含有生物原性刺激素的组织移植于病人的皮下，或者把含有生物原性刺激素的浸出液注射于病人的皮下。关于这些材料的来源，可以区别如下：
    甲、人体的各种不同的组织，譬如角膜，玻璃状体，巩膜，网膜，视神经，水晶状体，皮肤，皮下组织，脾，肝，腹膜，软骨，骨，肌肉，脑髓，睾丸，神经，胎盘等等。这些组织或者在手术的时候取得，譬如皮肤和腹膜就是，或者从尸体取下，或者从病人本身取得。
    从动物取得的这些组织，也同样地可以利用于治疗。
    关于这些材料冷藏时间和消毒，以及移植的方法，姑且略而不谈。
    乙、用生物的组织，制成浸出液，施行注射。用于浸出液制造的组织很多，譬如１．人类的胎盘，２．尸体的皮肤，睾丸，肌肉，脑髓，腹膜等，３．动物的组织，譬如牛，羊，马，兔的皮肤，神经，脑髓，睾丸，腹膜，水晶状体等等，４．植物，譬如芦荟叶，龙舌兰，车前子，甜菜茎等，藏于无光线的地方若干时期以后，制成浸出液使用。
    丙、生物体内的液体物质，譬如尸体的（人或动物）水晶体，人或动物的脊髓炎，人血等等，冷藏和消毒后使用。
    组织疗法的用途，起初费拉托夫使用组织疗法医治眼科疾病，很有卓著的成绩。他先后发表关于眼科应用本法治疗的报告很多。对于角膜炎，近视性脉络膜炎，视神经萎缩，色素性网膜炎，砂眼性血管翳，水晶状体溷浊的症例，合计数千以上，大部分都能奏效。以后费拉托夫更在眼科以外，利用于其他种类的疾病，也颇有成绩。在去年（一九五○）他的报告里，他举出狼疮，结核性皮肤溃疡，瘢痕性狭窄（食道，水道），皮肤利虚曼病，皮硬化症，红斑性狼疮，牛皮癣，湿疹，末梢神经炎，支气管性喘息，胃溃疡及十二指肠溃疡，妇科慢性炎症，外伤后关节运动不全症，骨折愈着不全，自发性坏疽，斑疹伤寒，布氏杆菌神经炎，梅毒瘤，陪拉克病，癫病，精神分裂症，小儿科疾病及高血压症等等。
    需要注意的，费拉托夫曾经指明过：对于喉结核和肺结核，必须特别小心地应用本法。起初用小量组织浸出液（○·一至○·二）注射，逐渐增加分量。经过长期准备注射以后，才可以使用移植，否则不妥。
    费拉托夫的组织疗法，无疑地，在治疗医学上是一个重要的发现。一九五○年，苏联的最高医学研究机关，医学研究院的外科研究所，因为曾经奉苏联政府命令，追试费拉托夫组织疗法的效力，发表了一个报告。该报告仅仅包括了二百零七名的各种不同疾病的病人，所得的成绩与费拉托夫本人报告的成绩，不无若干的出入，但该外科研究所所用组织疗法处置的病人数字极小，并且也很有一部分病人获得了相当的效果。
    从一九三三年，费拉托夫发表组织疗法以来，已经有十六年之久。现在在苏联已经有一百五十个以上的城市和乡村使用组织疗法。苏联政府卫生部，俄罗斯社会主义共和国卫生部及乌克兰共和国卫生部，都支持组织疗法的推行。乌克兰共和国卫生部在一九四八年，组织了一个组织疗法专门委员会，特别注意这个问题的研究和推广。费拉托夫本人由于组织疗法发现的功勋，受了斯大林一等奖。
    组织疗法在新中国已经有几处施行，这是很可喜的现象。在上海方面，同济大学医院的外科裘法祖和童尔昌两医师已经开始用组织疗法医治各种病人百数十名，眼科陈钱两医师用本法医治眼科疾病将近百人，上海铁路医院最近也用本法医治各种病人四十余名。因为开始组织疗法时间不长，所治的病人数字还是很少，不能作很普遍的结论，但是若干的症例已经有特异的效果。譬如：同济大学医院外科的报告中试举一两则如下：
    １病人王智强，二十二岁，工人，二年前受外伤以后，下腿发生溃疡。先在宏仁医院医治月余，以后在同济大学医院医治三个月以上，都无效果。去年九月，由病人大腿切去皮肤，当做组织疗法的材料，移植于下腿溃疡部，只过两星期就完全收口。
    ２病人卫世煌，二十三岁，工人。去年十一月中旬右前膀受机器外伤。创口一部分，贻留疤痕很大，一部分仍然久不收口。在杭州曾施行通常外科植皮术两次无效。在同济受治疗的时候，右手膀仅能弯曲到一六○度。本年一月九日在同济医院受组织治疗法的处置。（冷藏脾脏）。过三天后，手膀完全能够伸直，可以做一八○度的运动，全院外科医师都很感惊异，更增加对组织疗法的信心。
    在同济外科用本法医治气喘病人五十余名，手术后，三分之二以上的病人都有显著的效果。其他如尿道狭窄，手术后的肠梗阻，也用本法治疗而有效果。眼科病人用本法治疗后，大部分的成绩，很能满意。譬如对于沙眼性血管翳，虹膜睫状体炎，腺质性角膜炎，视神经萎缩，球后视神经炎等等，效果非常显著。
    上海铁路医院眼科用组织疗法处置眼科疾病四十名左右，也很有成绩。天津也有了报告，证明组织疗法对于眼科疾病的有效。
    在中国，组织疗法的应用，虽不过才有三百名左右的病人，但本疗法的效果已经证明有大量推广的必要。本方法的优点，在于方法的简单和治疗范围的广泛，从医疗实际而言，这是值得更进一步的应用和研究的。
    费拉托夫院士在医学方面的成就很大，本文所举的角膜移植术和组织疗法，不过是只就他的最重要的贡献，做了一个极简单的介绍。他今年已经达到七十六岁的高寿，还是孜孜不倦地为苏联科学求进步。他在苏联所受的尊敬和名誉是莫大的。关于他的角膜移植术，有两个电影，其一是《角膜移植术》，另一个是捷京国际电影比赛获得奖金的《重见光明》。
    费拉托夫院士在医学上的贡献如此巨大，固然由于他的天才和努力，而最大的成功因素，却是由于苏联政府的重视科学，奖励科学。他在革命以前所发表的研究论文不过十二篇，而在十月革命以后所发表的论文却有二百五十篇以上。在社会主义的国家里，一个爱国的科学家的前途，总是广大而壮丽的，这就是一个证明。费拉托夫及其学派和苏联其他眼科专家所做的角膜移植术，在去年已经达到三千二百名以上，这就几乎达到欧美全体所做同样手术的两倍，这更可见科学在社会主义国家中是如何容易发达。
    在本文的最后，谨祝费拉托夫院士的高年康健，光大他的组织疗法的研究，同时更希望毛泽东时代的我国医学界的同人，学习费拉托夫院士五十年以上在医学方面不断的努力，提高新中国医学的水准，为祖国的人民服务。
