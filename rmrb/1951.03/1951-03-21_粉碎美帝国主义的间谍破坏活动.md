　　Crush the American Imperialists' Espionage and Sabotage Activities
　　After a long period of investigation, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau cracked an espionage organization of the American imperialist "Army Strategic Intelligence Service" lurking in Tianjin, and removed an important stronghold of American imperialism for carrying out espionage activities in China. This is another great victory for the Chinese people in the great struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.
　　The cracking of this case once again proves that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. As early as World War II, American imperialism, under the guise of an "ally," carried out large-scale espionage activities in various parts of China. At that time, its espionage headquarters sent a large number of American spies to China to assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in training spies, and openly established the US-Chiang joint espionage organization - "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" in 1942. On the one hand, it brutally murdered Chinese patriots, creating the bloody massacre in the Chongqing concentration camp where more than 300 patriots were slaughtered overnight. On the other hand, it cultivated its pawns for aggression against China. In 1944, the American imperialist espionage organization "Strategic Intelligence Bureau" established an open agency in China - the "Strategic Services Office" headquarters, as one of the central organizations for American imperialism to carry out espionage activities in China, and stole a large amount of important information from our country. After the end of World War II, American imperialism replaced the German, Italian, and Japanese aggressive groups, collected German, Italian, and Japanese fascist spies, and continued to carry out espionage activities, attempting to pave the way for annexing Korea, invading China, and attacking the Soviet Union. This is as Chairman Mao said: "All these counter-revolutionary activities are instigated behind the scenes by imperialism, especially American imperialism." The funds and equipment for the espionage activities of these American imperialist running dogs of different nationalities were all provided by American imperialism and were uniformly under the command of American imperialism, serving the war policy of American imperialism. With the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the American imperialist espionage organization went into hiding and successively set up underground radio stations in various places to continue collecting important information from China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and other countries, in preparation for launching a war of aggression. The Beijing Municipal People's Public Security Bureau cracked the "Peiping General Branch of the Army Strategic Intelligence Service" in 1949. These facts nakedly expose the criminal face of American imperialism.
　　This case makes us see more clearly that the American imperialist spies are ubiquitous. They use various disguises to infiltrate our state organs, factories, mines, and schools, and occupy important positions such as the chief of the reporting section of the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau; in addition, they also open stores to cover up their criminal activities. Therefore, all cadres and staff of all agencies and people from all walks of life across the country must be vigilant at all times, block all gaps that may be exploited by the enemy, and completely eliminate the American imperialist spies in China. We firmly advocate that American imperialist spies must be severely punished. At the same time, we must continue to be vigilant against the continued wrongdoing of the American-Chiang secret agents. Only in this way can we eliminate their counter-revolutionary activities and protect the security of our motherland and the happiness of our people. All their criminal activities will inevitably be completely crushed by the power of the people.

### 粉碎美帝国主义的间谍破坏活动

　　粉碎美帝国主义的间谍破坏活动
    天津市人民政府公安局经过长期侦察，破获了美帝国主义“陆军战略情报处”在天津潜伏的间谍组织，拔除了美帝国主义在中国进行特务活动的一个重要据点。这是中国人民在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大斗争中的又一巨大胜利。
    这次破获的案件，再次证明了美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。远在第二次世界大战时期，美帝国主义就挑着“盟国”的幌子，在中国各地进行大规模的特务活动。当时它的特务大本营曾派遣了大批的美籍特务来华，协助蒋介石匪帮训练特务，并于一九四二年明目张胆地建立了美蒋的联合特务组织——“中美特种技术合作所”，一面残杀我国爱国志士，造成了重庆集中营一夜屠杀我三百多位爱国志士的大血案，一面培养其侵略我国的爪牙。一九四四年，美帝国主义特务组织“战略情报局”，在中国建立了公开机关——“战略服务处”总部，作为美帝国主义在中国进行特务活动的中心组织之一，大量窃取我国的重要情报。第二次世界大战结束后，美帝国主义代替了德、意、日侵略集团，搜罗了德、意、日法西斯特务，继续进行特务活动，企图借此为吞并朝鲜、侵略中国、进攻苏联铺平道路。这正如毛主席所说的：“所有这些反革命活动，都有帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在背后策动。”这些不同国籍的美帝国主义走狗的特务活动的经费和器材都是由美帝国主义供给的，统一在美帝国主义指挥下，为美帝国主义的战争政策效劳。随着中国人民解放战争的胜利，美帝国主义在中国的特务组织隐蔽起来，先后在各地设立了潜伏电台，继续搜集中国、苏联、朝鲜等国的重要情报，为其发动侵略战争作准备。北京市人民公安机关即曾于一九四九年破获美国“陆军战略情报处北平总支部”。这些事实都赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义的罪恶面目。
    这个案件，使我们更清楚地看到，美帝国主义的特务是无孔不入的。他们利用各种伪装打入我们的国家机关、工厂、矿山、学校，并窃据了象天津电信局一分局报务主任那样的重要职位；此外，他们并开设商店以掩护其罪恶活动。因此，所有机关的干部人员及全国各界人民必须时时刻刻提高警惕，堵塞一切可能被敌人利用的空隙，把美帝国主义在中国的特务分子完全肃清。我们坚决主张对于美帝国主义的间谍分子，必须予以严厉的惩治。同时，我们一定还要继续警惕美蒋特务分子的继续作恶。只要如此，我们就一定能够消灭他们的反革命活动，保卫我们祖国的安全和人民的幸福。它们的一切罪恶活动必然会被人民的力量所彻底粉碎。
