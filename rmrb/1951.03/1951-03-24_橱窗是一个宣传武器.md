　　The Shop Window Is A Propaganda Weapon
    Shop assistants in various industries in Shanghai used shop windows to conduct current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the masses. The shop window of Lihua Company on Nanjing Road displayed "The Embarrassing Situation of American Soldiers in Korea," which was crowded with viewers from morning to night, and many people made a special trip of more than ten miles to see it. Shao Wansheng South Goods Store arranged "Truman's Year-End Account" in the shop window to illustrate the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of American imperialism. Hengfeng Silk and Cloth Store had so many viewers that the evening closing time was delayed from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
    When arranging the shop windows, the shop assistants used their brains and came up with various methods. For example, the shop assistants of Lihua Company cut the original old puppets in the company into two sections, the upper body as wounded American soldiers, and the lower body as American soldier corpses buried in the snow. They also borrowed military uniforms, leather shoes, steel helmets, etc. to dress the puppets. It was originally estimated that it would cost 300,000 yuan to arrange a shop window, but it only cost 90,000 yuan.
    Before the arrangement of the shop window, the trade union of Sanyou Industrial Society first mobilized employees to see the shop window arranged by Lihua Company. When they came back, they organized discussions to make employees realize that this was indeed a good method to publicize current affairs and that it was helpful to business. So the employees arranged the shop window. Some shop assistants were also educated in the process of arranging the shop windows. A shop assistant in Lihua Company who designed shop windows used to think that the United States was good in everything. The trade union mobilized him to arrange the shop window, which gradually made him realize that American imperialism was just a paper tiger that looked strong but was actually weak. When he heard that new content was going to be arranged again, he took the initiative to visit shop windows of other units to learn from experience, and also selected appropriate cartoons from newspapers and magazines as reference materials for arranging shop windows.
    After the shop windows were arranged, many people watched them, and newspapers published news photos, which made the business of the stores better. Shunchangtai Hardware Store originally had a slow month in January, but after the shop window was arranged, the business was very good, and the turnover was almost the same as the busiest month. The capitalists of Hengdali Watch Store saw that the Lihua Company opposite had increased its operating income due to the arrangement of the shop window, and also took the initiative to ask employees to design and arrange it. Many stores began to use shop windows for current affairs propaganda after the Shanghai Municipal Store Employees Union mobilized them in late December last year. In order to enable the shop window arrangement of various units to continuously play the role of educating the masses, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Store Employees Union recently wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, hoping that it would be forwarded to the capitalists of various industries to pay attention to combining current affairs education content to arrange shop windows.

### 橱窗是一个宣传武器

　　橱窗是一个宣传武器
    上海市各业店员利用橱窗向群众进行了抗美援朝时事教育。南京路丽华公司的橱窗布置了“美国兵在朝鲜的狼狈相”，每天从早到晚挤满了观众，许多人特地跑了十多里路来看。邵万生南货店在橱窗里布置了“杜鲁门年关结账”，说明美帝国主义的外强中干。恒丰绸布庄观众太多，把晚上上门的时间从下午六点延迟到七点。
    店员们在布置橱窗时，都开动脑筋，想出各种办法。如丽华公司店员把公司里原有的旧木偶截成两段，上身作美国伤兵，下身作了被雪掩埋的美国兵尸体，大家并借来了军服、皮鞋、钢盔等物穿在木偶身上，原来估计要花费三十万元才能布置好一个橱窗，结果只花了九万元。
    三友实业社在布置前，工会先发动职工去看丽华公司布置的橱窗，回来时又组织漫谈，使职工认识了这确是宣传时事的好方法，并且对业务有帮助。于是职员们便把橱窗布置了起来。有些商店店员在布置橱窗的过程中，自己也得到了教育。丽华公司有一个设计橱窗的店员，过去以为美国样样好，工会动员他来布置橱窗，渐渐使他认识到美帝国主义不过是个外强中干的纸老虎。当他听到又要布置新内容的时候，就主动到别的单位橱窗去参观，吸取经验，又在报纸杂志上，选择适当的漫画作为布置橱窗的参考材料。
    橱窗布置以后，看的人多，各报又刊载了新闻照片，使商店的营业也好起来。顺昌泰五金号一月份本来是淡月，但布置了橱窗以后，生意很好，营业额与最旺月相差无几。亨达利钟表行资方看见了对面的丽华公司因布置了橱窗，营业收入增加，也主动要求职工设计布置。许多商店利用橱窗进行时事宣传是去年十二月下旬经过上海市店员工会动员后开始的。为使各单位的橱窗布置能经常起教育群众的作用，店员工会上海市委员会最近已写信给上海市工商联合会，希望转请各业资方重视结合时事教育内容来布置橱窗。（新华社）
