　　A factory in Anshan City, Northeast China, has strengthened the publicity and education of the Trade Union Law. Workers have generally gained a more correct understanding of trade unions. At the same time, because trade union cadres have earnestly improved their work in accordance with the spirit of the Trade Union Law, the prestige of the trade union among the workers has gradually increased, and the organization of the trade union itself has been consolidated and expanded accordingly.

　　The factory has a total of 2,388 employees, of whom 1,836 are trade union members, and 552 are not trade union members. Most of those who have not joined the trade union do not know what the trade union does. For example, sand molder Ge Shouquan said: "Joining the trade union only takes membership fees, it's not worth anything! Whether you join or not, you still have to work." Many technicians and staff members claim that they "do not meet the requirements" and are unwilling to join the trade union. Among the trade union members, many joined without really understanding what the trade union is. Some even feel that joining the trade union is a burden and are unwilling to pay membership fees.

　　In order to change the above situation and consolidate and develop the trade union organization, after the factory trade union carried out a democratic re-election under the leadership of the Communist Party General Branch, it conducted a general and systematic education on the Trade Union Law among trade union members and workers, and inspected and improved trade union work in accordance with the spirit of the Trade Union Law. As a result, significant results were achieved: In February, 39 workers joined the union, and in the first two weeks of March, 43 new members were developed. The proportion of trade union members paying membership fees has also increased unprecedentedly. In February, 96 percent of the total number of members paid membership fees, while the best time in the past year was only 84 percent of the total number of members. Sand molder and trade union member Dai Chenglin not only did not pay his membership fees in the past, but also incited other members not to pay. After studying the Trade Union Law this time, he realized that the trade union is the working class's own organization, openly reviewed his past erroneous views, and voluntarily paid off the five months of membership fees he owed in one lump sum.

　　Several people from the factory's trade union chairman and organization committee had just returned from the Workers' Political University and the CCP Party School and attach great importance to the mass line. In addition to focusing on trade union law education, they also paid attention to improving the trade union's own work style and methods, focusing on workshops, strengthening the work of workshop branches, promoting democracy, and extensively absorbing trade union members and workers to participate in trade union work. For example, the seven specialized work committees of a certain workshop branch united more than 100 employees around it to carry out various tasks. In the past, because most of the work was taken on by the factory-level trade union, the factory-level trade union cadres felt too busy, while the branch cadres felt they had nothing to do and did not know how to work. Now the situation has changed. Because the factory-level trade union allows the branch cadres to do the work, many branch committee members have been trained through practical work. Take the subsidy and mutual aid fund work as an example. In the past, it was directly controlled by the factory-level trade union. Because the factory-level trade union cadres did not understand the situation well enough, unreasonable phenomena often occurred, such as those who should have been subsidized were not subsidized, and those who should not have been subsidized were subsidized. Moreover, the monthly mutual aid fund was often insufficient, and the workers had many opinions, such as: "Anyway, I can't borrow it! The money has been borrowed by people I know!" They expressed dissatisfaction with the trade union's work. Since this work was handed over to the mutual aid committee members of each branch to directly control, and the subsidy objects and amounts were assessed based on the actual situation of the workshop and the opinions of the masses, the mutual aid fund was sufficient, and even had a surplus. Because the money was used appropriately, the workers generally had no objections. The number of workers participating in the mutual aid association has increased significantly, with an increase of 40 in February, and 75 in the first two weeks of March alone.

　　The factory's trade union law education is expected to end in mid-April. Their teaching methods are mainly based on the "Explanation of the Trade Union Law" compiled and published by the Northeast Labor Daily, and explain it chapter by chapter in conjunction with the ideological problems of the employees, and organize discussion meetings by unit to enable employees to deeply understand the content of the Trade Union Law. At the same time, they pay attention to practical education. For example, in addition to using one hour a day (three or four times a week) for general education, they also run amateur training classes for group leaders to enable the most basic-level cadres of the trade union to learn how to use the Trade Union Law to carry out their work.

### 鞍山某工厂加强工会法宣传教育  职工认识提高、工会组织随着巩固和扩大

　　鞍山某工厂加强工会法宣传教育
    职工认识提高、工会组织随着巩固和扩大
    东北鞍山市某工厂工人经过工会法的学习，普遍地对工会有了比较正确的认识；同时，由于工会干部根据工会法的精神，认真地改进了自己的工作，使工会在工人群众中的威信逐渐提高，工会本身的组织也随着巩固和扩大了。
    该厂职工总数是二千三百八十八名，工会会员共有一千八百三十六名，没有参加工会的有五百五十二名。这些没有参加工会的多数不知道工会是干什么的。例如：翻沙工人葛守全说：“参加工会光拿会费，不顶什么事！参加也干活，不参加也干活。”好多技术人员和职员则推说自己“条件不够”，不愿参加工会。在工会会员中，有不少人是糊里糊涂地进来的，对工会并没有确切的认识，有的甚至感到参加工会是个负担，不愿意缴纳会费。
    为了改变上述情况，巩固和发展工会组织，该厂工会在共产党总支领导下实行民主改选后，即在工会会员和职工群众中普遍地、有系统地进行了工会法的教育，并根据工会法的精神检查和改进工会工作，结果收效很大：二月份有工人三十九名入会，三月份上中两旬又发展了新会员四十三名；工会会员缴纳会费的比例也空前地提高了，二月份缴纳会费的占全体会员人数百分之九十六，而去年一年中最好的时候也只占会员总数的百分之八十四。翻沙工友、工会会员戴成林过去不仅自己不缴纳会费，还怂恿别的会员不缴纳会费，这次学习了工会法，知道工会是工人阶级自己的团体，公开检讨了个人过去的错误看法，自动将旧欠的五个月的会费一次缴清。
    该厂工会主席、组织委员几个人，是刚从工人政治大学和中共党校毕业回来的，对群众路线都很重视，他们除了抓紧工会法教育，并注意改进工会本身的工作作风和工作方法，把工作重点放到车间去，加强车间分会的工作，发扬民主，广泛吸收工会会员和职工群众参加工会工作。例如某车间分会七个专门工作委员会，就团结了一百多位职工在它周围进行各种各样的工作。过去因为大部工作都揽在厂级工会身上，厂级工会干部感到忙不开，而分会干部却觉得无事可做，也不知道该怎么工作。现在情况变了，因为厂级工会放手让分会干部做工作的结果，很多分会委员都从实际工作中锻炼出来了。就以补贴互助金这项工作来说吧，过去由厂级工会直接掌握，因为厂级工会干部对情况了解得不够，往往发生该补贴的没有补贴，不该补贴的却补贴了等不合理现象，而且每月的互助金常不敷用，职工意见很多，如说：“反正我是借不着！钱都叫认识的人借去了！”对工会工作表示不满。自从把这项工作交由各分会互助委员直接掌握，根据车间实际情况和群众意见评定补助对象和数目，互助金就够用了，甚至有节余的，因为钱用得恰当，职工群众一般都没有意见，参加互助会的职工有显著的增加，二月份增加四十名，三月份仅上中两旬即增加了七十五人。
    该厂工会法的教育，预计四月中旬结束。他们的教学方法，主要是根据东北劳动日报编载的“工会法讲解”，结合职工思想问题逐章逐节地讲解，按单元组织讨论会，使职工深刻了解工会法的内容，同时并注重实践的教育，例如他们除了利用每天一小时（每周三、四次）进行一般教育外，并开办小组长业余训练班，使工会最基层的干部学会运用工会法开展工作。
