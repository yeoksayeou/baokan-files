　　People's Representative Conferences in East China Over the Past Year
    People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life have been widely held in provinces, cities, and counties throughout the East China region in the past year. All provinces (regions) except Fujian, thirty-nine cities with populations over 30,000, and over 97% of counties in the region have held People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life. Among them, the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life in Shandong Province and the cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, and Qingdao also exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the People's Government Committees of the respective provinces and cities.
    In the past year, People's Representative Conferences at all levels and from all walks of life have resolved many major issues based on the central tasks of various regions and the common demands of the broad masses of people. Last spring, Shanghai's industry and commerce suffered serious difficulties. The city's People's Representative Conference from all walks of life focused on discussing this issue and jointly agreed on methods to maintain production and overcome difficulties, greatly strengthening the unity of people from all strata and enhancing their confidence in overcoming difficulties. At the first People's Representative Conference of all circles in Northern Anhui Administrative Region, representatives reflected the urgent demands of millions of people along the Huai River to control the Huai River's floodwaters once and for all, and immediately discussed it. The representatives guaranteed to assist the government in mobilizing two million laborers to participate in the Huai River control project and specifically discussed methods of providing work as relief. Many disaster victims who had gone to other places heard about the Huai River control project and returned one after another to participate in the work.
    The People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life universally discussed resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, promoting the development of this patriotic movement. When the US imperialists expanded their war of aggression, seriously threatening the security of our people, at conferences in various regions, people's representatives from all strata brought forward proposals to resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and conducted heated discussions. From cities to villages, people from all walks of life signed patriotic covenants or patriotic action programs to resist America and aid Korea. After Shanghai held the People's Representative Conference from all walks of life with resisting America and aiding Korea as the central topic, an unprecedented anti-American patriotic movement quickly unfolded. People from all walks of life continuously held anti-American patriotic demonstrations and parades, and many representatives took the lead in sending their children to military cadre schools. Due to the patriotic production competition initiated by worker representatives, the output per spindle per twenty hours of twenty yarns in sixteen state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai increased from less than one pound to over one pound. After Qingyun County, Shandong Province, held the People's Representative Conference from all walks of life, the movement to resist America and aid Korea deepened in the countryside. After the people's representatives from all walks of life returned to their villages, they actively conducted anti-American and patriotic propaganda and education; slogans supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers were written everywhere on the blackboards in various villages.
    The convening of the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life promoted democracy and strengthened the connection between the People's Government and the people. Many industrialists and businessmen and neighborhood residents in Shanghai put forward suggestions to the city's People's Representative Conference from all walks of life, requesting the government to help them further organize. Representatives in various regions not only made criticisms and suggestions regarding the government's work and cadre style at the meetings, but also actively assisted the government in carrying out its work after returning to their posts. After the People's Representative Conference from all walks of life in Taining County, Fujian Province, studied the issue of suppressing bandits and eliminating secret agents, three farmer representatives assisted the government in capturing nine secret agent bandits and won over twelve bandits to start anew.
    In the past year, People's Representative Conferences at all levels and from all walks of life have generally been convened on schedule, and many cities and counties have held them three to four times. The People's Democratic United Front has also been increasingly consolidated and expanded. The Second First People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Shanghai expanded not only in the number of representatives by 25% compared to the First First Conference, but also increased representatives from neighborhood residents and ethnic minorities. At the same time, the methods of generating representatives for the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life have also been gradually improved. In places where mass organizations have a foundation, direct elections by the masses are generally the main method, supplemented by consultative nomination. Many regions also used various methods to solicit the people's opinions on specially invited representatives.

　　华东各地一年来的人民代表会议
    华东区各省、市、县一年来已普遍举行各界人民代表会议。全区除福建以外的各省（区）、三十九个三万人口以上的城市和百分之九十七以上的县，都已举行各界人民代表会议。其中，山东省和上海、南京、济南、青岛等市的各界人民代表会议并代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了各该省、市的人民政府委员会。
    各级各界人民代表会议一年来根据各地中心工作及广大人民群众的共同要求，解决了许多重大问题。去春上海工商业遭受严重困难，该市各界人民代表会议便集中讨论了这个问题，共同协议了维持生产、度过困难的办法，大大加强了各阶层人民的团结，提高了各界人民战胜困难的信心。皖北行政区首次各界人民代表会议上，代表们反映了淮河沿岸的千百万人民对根治淮河水患的迫切要求，并立即加以讨论。代表们保证协助政府动员二百万民工参加治淮工程，并具体讨论了以工代赈的办法。很多到外地去的灾民，听说要治淮河，纷纷回来参加工作。
    各界人民代表会议普遍讨论了抗美援朝保家卫国，推动了这一爱国运动的展开。当美帝国主义扩大侵略战争严重威胁我国人民安全的时候，在各地会议上，人民代表从各个阶层带来了抗美援朝保家卫国的提案，进行了热烈的讨论。从城市到乡村，各界人民纷纷订立了抗美援朝爱国公约或爱国行动纲领。上海市开过以抗美援朝为中心议题的各界人民代表会议后，空前规模的反美爱国运动迅速展开，各界人民连续举行了反美爱国示威游行，不少代表带头送自己的子女参加军事干部学校。由于工人代表带头发起了爱国主义的生产竞赛，上海十六个国营棉纺织厂二十支纱每锭二十小时产量，由过去的不及一磅提高到一磅以上。山东省庆云县开过各界人民代表会议后，抗美爱国运动深入到农村。各界人民代表回村后，积极进行抗美爱国的宣传教育；各个村的黑板报上到处都写着支援中国人民志愿军的标语。
    各界人民代表会议的召开，发扬了民主并加强了人民政府与人民间的联系。上海市很多工商业家和里弄居民向该市各界人民代表会议提出建议，要求政府帮助他们进一步组织起来。各地代表不仅在会议上对于政府工作和干部作风提出了批评和建议，并且回到自己的岗位上积极协助政府进行工作。福建省泰宁县各界人民代表会议研究了剿灭土匪与肃清特务的问题以后，有三个农民代表协助政府捕获了九名特务匪徒，并争取了十二名土匪自新。
    一年来，各级各界人民代表会议大都能按期召开，不少市、县已开过三次至四次。人民民主统一战线也日益巩固和扩大。上海市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议较第一届第一次会议，不但在代表名额上扩大了百分之二十五，并且增加了里弄居民及少数民族代表。同时，各界人民代表会议代表产生的方式，也逐步有所改进。在群众组织有基础的地方，一般以群众直接选举为主，协商推选为辅。不少地区也用各种方式征询了人民对特邀代表的意见。
