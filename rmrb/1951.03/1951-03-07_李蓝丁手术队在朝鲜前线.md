　　Li Landing Surgical Team on the Korean Front
    Xiaohai
    Since arriving on the Korean front, the Shanghai Military Medical University volunteer surgical team, led by Comrade Li Landing, has continuously worked in coordination with various field medical teams on a rotating basis. In the past, Team Leader Li had coughed up blood due to long hours working on wounded soldiers, and had even twisted ligaments while rescuing wounded soldiers crossing a river. Now, she is working day and night again. She needs to examine the wounds of the injured, arrange the progress of the operations, organize X-ray examinations... Under her leadership, the surgical team is reducing the pain of the wounded at the fastest speed, healing their injuries, and enabling the soldiers to return to the front lines.
    All the working comrades in the team are taking Team Leader Li as an example and working selflessly. In the ward, Comrade Dai Suyu, in addition to completing general work tasks, automatically bathes the wounded and cuts their nails. She gets up before dawn every day to go to work in the ward, and doesn't return to eat dinner until everyone has quieted down for the night. She is particularly concerned about the seriously wounded, often buying them fruit. Therefore, the wounded all love and respect her, saying: "She takes care of us even better than our own sisters!"
    Comrade Ruan Hanqing repeatedly requested to donate blood to the seriously wounded. When a wounded soldier undergoing surgery needed a blood transfusion, she unhesitatingly donated 200 CC, and repeatedly told the transfusion comrades: "I can draw another 200 CC if needed." Trainee laboratory technician Wang Jinrong works during the day and also checks blood types, looks for bacteria, and does tests at 12 o'clock every night. She often runs back and forth on the frozen ground in the biting cold wind.
    Surgeon-in-charge Dr. Zhang Zhong insisted on working even though he had diarrhea. Dr. Wang Haoran has been suffering from stomach problems, but he is not only responsible for the medical care of more than one hundred wounded soldiers, but also participates in surgery. Dr. Chen Houyi of internal medicine, seeing that other doctors were busy, automatically helped with the X-ray work.
    In their practical work, the entire team studied the characteristics of field medical work and brought their technical abilities into full play. In a month and a half, they performed more than 300 procedures, including lumbar and thoracic sympathetic ganglionectomy and ligation and removal of aneurysms. No wound festered after the surgery.
    In the midst of their intense work, the volunteer surgical team also completed the teaching tasks of short-term training courses in nursing, anesthesia, surgical management, plaster casting, blood transfusion, and pharmacy. Doctors and nurses are busy with treatment and nursing work during the day, performing surgery, and preparing teaching materials at night.
    Due to the selfless work of all the comrades in the surgical team, a close relationship has developed between the surgical team and the wounded. During the New Year, the wounded specially held a banquet to entertain the volunteer surgical team comrades. Deputy Team Leader Professor Gu Yuequan said with emotion: "I have been a surgeon for more than ten years, and this is the first time I have participated in a banquet for the wounded. When I see batches of heroic volunteer soldiers being discharged from the hospital, I feel that we medical workers have finally made some contribution to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement!"

　　李蓝丁手术队在朝鲜前线
    啸海
    以李蓝丁同志为队长的上海军医大学志愿手术队，到了朝鲜前线以后，即不断地在各野战医疗队中，巡回配合工作。李队长过去曾因长期为伤员工作而吐过血，为挽救过河的伤员而扭断了筋骨，现在，她又不分白天黑夜地工作着。她要检查伤员的伤口，布置手术的进行，组织Ｘ光检验……。在她带领下，手术队以最快的速度，减少伤员的痛苦，治好创伤，使战士们重回前线。
    全队的工作同志，都以李队长为榜样，忘我地工作着。戴素玉同志在病房里，除了完成一般的工作任务外，自动替伤员擦澡，剪指甲，每日天不亮就起床上病房工作，晚上人都睡静了才回来吃晚饭。她对重伤员特别关心，时常给他们买水果。因此，伤员都爱戴她，说：“她照顾我们比亲姐妹还要好！”
    阮涵清同志数次要求给重伤员输血。当一个正在施行手术的伤员需要输血时，她毫不犹疑地献出了二百ＣＣ，并再三对输血同志说：“需要的时候我还可以抽出二百ＣＣ。”见习化验员王金荣，白天工作，每天深夜十二时还要检查血型，找细菌，做化验。她经常冒着刺骨的寒风，在冻裂的地面上来回地跑着。
    外科主治医师张忠大夫，虽然泻肚子仍坚持工作。王浩然大夫一直患着胃病，但他不仅负责一百多个伤员的医疗工作，还要参加做手术。内科陈厚贻大夫，看见别的大夫工作忙，自动帮助Ｘ光工作。
    全队队员在实际工作中研究学习了野战医疗工作的特点，发挥了自己的技术能力。一个半月来，他们进行了腰与胸交感神经节摘除术，动脉瘤的结扎与摘除术等共三百多次，伤口在施行手术后未发生过化脓的现象。
    在紧张的工作中，志愿手术队又完成了护理、麻醉、手术管理、石膏、输血、药剂等短期训练班的教学任务。医生护士们白天忙着治疗护理工作，进行手术，夜里准备教材。
    由于手术队全体同志们的忘我工作，手术队与伤员之间产生了一种亲密的感情。新年时，伤员们特地设宴招待志愿手术队同志，副队长顾越泉教授感动地说：“我做了十几年外科医生，参加伤员的宴会还是第一次。当我看到英勇的志愿战士一批批地出院的时候，我觉得我们医务工作者对抗美援朝运动总算有了一些贡献！”
