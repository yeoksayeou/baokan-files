            Some Problems in *A Brief History of American Aggression Against China*
    In our publications, the first book to comprehensively and systematically summarize the American policy of aggression against China and historical facts over the past 100 years with a correct viewpoint is Liu Danian's *A Brief History of American Aggression Against China*, written in November 1948. Since the first edition of this book in November 1949, the cumulative number of copies printed nationwide has reached 238,800 as of January of this year (Beijing's sixth edition) and the publishing figures for other regions in December 1950. This shows how popular it is among the vast readership and the important role it has played in educating the Chinese people in the struggle against America. Judging from its influence on the writing community, the viewpoints and materials in several books discussing the history of American aggression against China, which were published successively last year and in January and February of this year, are largely based on this book. To this day, it is still one of the better books of its kind.
    However, because of the difficult conditions when this book was originally written, it still has some shortcomings. Since the subsequent books largely used this book as a blueprint, the errors in this book have become repeated errors, which must be pointed out.
    (1) "In 1862, American warships bombarded Maguan, obtaining Japan's compromise" (page 8). According to various historical records, the American warship Wyoming bombarded Maguan once alone in 1863; the reference here should be to the joint fleet of the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and France bombarding Maguan, forcing Japan to open the Maguan Strait, recognize the Treaty of Commerce of 1858, and allow British and French troops to be stationed in Japan. The time should be 1864.
    (2) "By 1868, Pire and Harris had helped Japan open up commerce and plan the Restoration Movement" (same page). The author here notes that this information is quoted from "Kolesky, USA, USSR, translated by Zhao Gongjiao: American Far Eastern Policy, Diplomacy Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 3." The writer did not check this source, but the fact is that Pire died in New York in March 1858, and Harris served as the U.S. Consul to Japan for six years from 1856, also returning to the United States in April 1862. Therefore, this sentence is incorrect. However, if it is said that Pire and others had an influence on the opening of commerce in Japan and even the Restoration Movement of 1868, that is acceptable.
    (3) "In 1872, the United States... sent warships to Korea to force it to sign a treaty of commerce with the United States." (same page) The correct year should be 1871.
    (4) "In 1873... Li Xiande, the former U.S. Consul in Fujian... actually led American troops to attack Taiwan" (same page). The correct year should be 1867. Chen Gonglu's *Modern History of China* has a record, and Cai Meibiao's *The Anti-American War of National Defense of the Gaoshan People of Taiwan in 1867* was published in the eighth issue of the Progressive Daily Historical Studies Weekly on March 2, 1951, detailing this event.
    (5) "In 1874... the United States and Japan jointly sent troops to Taiwan on a large scale." (page 9) This does not entirely conform to historical facts. Li Xiande participated in this matter and introduced two Americans to the Japanese as consultants, but it is not correct to say that the United States "had army participation." In several later books, it is even said that they "organized a joint US-Japan army," which is even further from the truth.
    (6) "In 1874..., Taiwan was opened as a commercial port," (page 9) is incorrect. There is no such provision in the "Three Articles on Special Funds for Taiwan Affairs." Taiwan was designated as a treaty port as early as in the Sino-American Tianjin Treaty of 1858, and the United States had already obtained this privilege from then on. Therefore, the following statement that "the United States used Japan to gain a foothold in Taiwan and open up markets" (page 10) is also superfluous.
    (7) "British national Detring, Customs Commissioner of Tianjin..." (page 16), Detring was German.
    (8) "The famous American oil trust (i.e., Standard Oil Company) was established in 1900." (page 26), according to various records, Standard Oil Company was established in 1870, and it had the nature of a trust from the very beginning. Although Liu's book has some basis, 1870 is more certain.
    (9) "... Stader was the US Consul General in Fengtian (originally a Reuters correspondent in Korea, who was promoted to this position for his merits in invading China)..." (page 28), Stader served in Chinese customs in Nanjing and Beijing from 1902 to 1904, and was the private secretary of the US minister to Korea in 1905. It would be better to point out this experience, because this can serve as an explanation for the phrase "meritorious service in invading China."
    (10) "In February 1929, the American Kemmerer obtained 'financial advisor,' and prior to this, the American Gamel had obtained the chairman of the Design Committee of the Ministry of Finance and a special committee member of banking and currency..." (page 55), Kemmerer and Gamel were originally the same person (i.e., E.W. Kemmerer). This person was hired by the Chiang regime in 1928 to serve as an advisor to the pseudo-Ministry of Finance, and he organized a "Financial Design Committee" with twelve other so-called financial experts, and proposed a so-called currency reform plan in 1930.
    (11) There are also some translation names that need to be corrected in the book: (1) For example, on page 4, Major Shaw is translated as "Meyer Shaw." This person was a major during the American Revolutionary War. Major should be translated literally as major; (2) "Murray Hume" appears twice on pages 54 and 55. According to the transliteration, it should be "Mac Murray". It used to be translated as "Markham" in diplomatic documents; "Sino-American 'Tungsten' loan" should be generally referred to as "Tungsten Sand Loan."
            Opinions on Five Books Including *A History of American Imperialist Economic Aggression Against China*
    The works to be discussed in this section include books two through six in the book list above. Among these works, Wang Minzhi's *A Short History of American Aggression Against China* (hereinafter referred to as Wang's book) and Qin Benli's *A History of American Imperialist Economic Aggression Against China* (referred to as Qin's book) are the better two. Qin's book and Wang's book were both published earlier. In addition to adopting some historical materials and viewpoints from Liu's book, both books also adopted some materials from Hu Sheng's *Imperialism and Chinese Politics*. The two books also individually unearthed some new materials (such as Wang's book on early Sino-American trade and materials after 1948, and Qin's book on some materials on economic aggression against China). Qin's book gives a more systematic narrative of economic aggression. Wang's book and Qin's book also generally achieved the requirement of "narrating and analyzing historical events in chronological order." However, Wang's book and Qin's book both inherited most of the errors in Liu's book. Wang's book has fewer other errors (but not none), and Qin's book had many unique errors in the first edition to the third edition. Although the fourth edition in January 1951 has made most of the revisions, it still retains some errors.
    Qin's and Wang's books can be regarded as "pioneers" second only to Liu's book in terms of publication time among their similar books. Therefore, some of the errors in Qin's book were retained by later books. Examples can be found in Wang Chun's *Historical Tales of American Aggression Against China* (referred to as Wang's book). Wang's book uses relatively popular and lively writing to describe the historical facts of American aggression against China, and it is highly motivating and suitable for general workers and peasant cadres to read. It is also a good book. However, in addition to the general historical errors of similar books, there are also some individual errors. A book of the same nature as Wang's book is Shi Ying's edited *Romance of American Imperialist Aggression Against China*, which is adapted from Liu's materials in the form of a chapter novel. Because it is "narrating rather than creating," there are few unique errors, but there are some shortcomings in the writing.
    The *Historical Stories of American Imperialist Aggression Against China*, compiled by the History Department Group of the Trade Union of Beijing Normal University, was written as a learning material in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, based on the propaganda outline in the second issue of *Current Affairs Handbook*. There are some errors in the historical materials, and there are also a few inappropriate usages.
    The errors and shortcomings in writing in the above-mentioned books will be specifically pointed out below. Errors in Liu's book that are repeated by these books will no longer be cited here.
    (1) Qin's book (based on the fourth edition in January 1951): (1) "Cheng Yu, Governor-General of Liangguang" (page 2), should be Cheng Yucai. (2) "China newly gives commercial convenience to the people of other countries..." (same page), the word "newly" is a mistake for the word "given". This difference in words is very large and cannot be changed randomly. (3) "The United States supplied British and French salaries for a month" (page 4), the fact is that Britain and France supplied the US warships with salaries for a month. This error was accepted by Wang's book (see page 12 of Wang's book). (4) "The number of treaty ports increased by eight" (page 4), according to the Sino-American Tianjin Treaty, the number of treaty ports increased from five to seven. (5) "By 1899, Britain had occupied the port of Weihaiwei" (page 7), should be 1898. (6) "After the Hay Note was issued, British Prime Minister Chamberlain replied..." (page 9), the British Prime Minister at that time was Marquis of Salisbury (Bobert Ceeil), who formed a cabinet three times between 1885 and 1902. Joseph Chamberlain was then the Colonial Secretary of Salisbury's cabinet. (7) "...American merchants did a large arms deal with Wu Peifu, 10,000 rifles and 20 million bullets..." This historical material is quoted from Liu's book, which states "2 million bullets". This error in Qin's book was also followed by Wang's book (page 58 of Wang's book). (8) The Shanghai silver reserves in 1935 (4?) were mistakenly recorded as "4.6 billion yuan" in the first edition of the book (page 50). The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's "Reading and Publishing" pointed this out, Wang's book changed it to "460 million yuan" (page 77), and Qin's revised edition changed it again to "600 million yuan", but this number is still incorrect. According to the statistics of Shanghai silver reserves from 1929 to 1934 recorded in the "Shanghai Yearbook" (24th edition), the highest amount was 547,446,000 yuan at the end of 1933. About one-third flowed out in the second half of 1934, and the amount of silver reserves at the end of that year was only 334,997,000 yuan. Based on this, it can be judged that "600 million yuan" is conjecture. The author believes that if there is no reliable basis, casually changing it during the revision is not advisable.
    (2) Wang's book: (1) "US Envoy Frederic T. Ward..." (page 36) Fsederic T. Ward was the rogue and pirate Wall who organized the Foreign Rifle Team during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The US Envoy referred to here should be John E. Ward, which is generally translated as John Ward in historical documents. Here, the names of the robbers were mixed up. (2) "The 1930s were the decade in which the United States took an offensive in China" (page 109), "The expansion of American power was severely frustrated when it began in the 1940s" (page 110), according to the usual saying now, "1930s" and "1940s" should be mistakes for "1920s" and "1930s." (3) There is a "note" on page 32 of Wang's book, stating "see Chiang Gong (misprinted as 'Fa') Sheng's 'Summary of Sino-American Relations', page 64," and there is only one "note" on page 38, stating "same as above". Which "above" does "same" refer to? After checking Chiang's book, it was found that the footnote on page 32 should have been moved to page 38, and the source of the note on page 32 could not be found. Moreover, Wang's book is unfaithful to this quotation because it has changed and deleted the words of Gui Liang that were quoted. For example, the original text "when he asked to change the treaty" was changed to "when he asked to sign the treaty" (page 37), which has a different meaning.
    (3) *Historical Stories of American Imperialist Aggression Against China*: (1) "In 1874, the Taiwanese savages killed fifty-four Ryukyu refugees who were drifting..." (page 9), first, the year is inconsistent, and second, the term "Taiwanese savages" is too inappropriate. (2) "Li Xiande... sold the 'New York Maru' and 'Sheryo Maru' ships to Japan to transport troops..." (same page) is also inconsistent with the facts. (3) "In 1784, Li Xiande openly served as Japan's special envoy and plenipotentiary to negotiate with Tianjin..." (same page), Li Xiande accompanied Japan's plenipotentiary minister Okubo Toshimichi to China, but he did not "openly serve as Japan's plenipotentiary minister". (4) "In June 1931, Chiang Kai-shek launched the fourth 'encirclement'." (page 22), "It was in 1931 that the United States helped Chiang Kai-shek make the fourth 'encirclement' of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army..." (page 24), the fourth "encirclement" was in June 1932, and both are wrong here.
    (4) Wang's book: (1) "The United States sent a person named Berg, who, together with the British and French, re-submitted the contents of the revised treaty..." (pages 10-11), the author put forward four points, but the first point (regarding the protection of US ships patrolling freely in various ports) has been included in Article 32 of the Treaty of Wangxia, the second point (consular jurisdiction) has been included in Articles 21 and 25 of the same treaty, and the fourth point (equal benefits) has also been stipulated in the same treaty. The author himself said on page 21 of the same book about the fourth point "...the first is to demand 'equal benefits', which was successful from the beginning..." In fact, the three other things that the US government wanted Berg to demand at this time were: 1. US diplomats stationed in Beijing; 2. Unlimited expansion of the scope of commerce; 3. Abolition of all prohibitions restricting the personal freedom of American people in China (see Hu Sheng: *Imperialism and Chinese Politics*, page 24, quoted from Li Baohong: "Sino-American Diplomatic Relations"). (2) "But American imperialism refused to give up, ... the result was forcing the Qing government to open Taiwan as a commercial port and also pay an indemnity of 50 million taels" (page 20), "50 million taels" is a mistake for "500,000 taels", and these 500,000 taels were paid to Japan. Here, the meaning is unclear. (3) "Originally, when American imperialism invaded the Philippines, it was caught in a war of plunder with Spain" (page 21), which is inconsistent with historical facts. During the Spanish-American War, the resistance of the Spanish army collapsed immediately. The United States was caught in the resistance of the Philippine people, not in "a war of plunder with Spain". (4) "The Tianjin Treaty of 1857 stipulates..." (page 46) is a rewriting of the original sentence in the note "...our country insists on the policy of peace towards China initiated by our country in 1857..." (see Wang Yunsheng: *Sixty Years of China and Japan*, Volume 4, page 16), but this rewriting is wrong, because the Tianjin Treaty was concluded in 1858. (5) "The traitor Yuan... truly became emperor on January 1, 1916. This shameless emperor reigned for a total of six months and six days..." Yuan Shikai accepted the "Letter of Recommendation to become Emperor" on December 12, 1915, and formally proclaimed himself emperor the next day. He had planned to "ascend the throne" on January 1, 1916, but it never happened. He was forced to abolish the imperial system on March 22 of the same year. The explanation here is inconsistent with historical facts. (6) "In 1908... two invading robbers signed the... 'Gao Ping, Lutter' Agreement" (page 33), "...as a result, the US representative Luther changed it to four articles..." (page 54), this Lutter who signed the "Gao Ping, Lutter Agreement" in 1908 and the "Luther" who drafted the four principles at the Washington Conference are the same person (Elihu Root), why are they translated into two names? Incidentally, Wang's book often changes some relatively common personal names, such as changing Gu Xing (Gu Sheng) to "Ku Xing", Berg to "Bergia", and Rheins to "Rains", which is really unnecessary, because the characters "Gu", "Berg" and "Rhe" still appeared in the same book.
    (5) Shi's book: "There was a Ryukyu sea boat that was blown by wind and waves to the coast of Taiwan. The stranded Ryukyu sailors landed to take shelter, and before they could even stand firm, a group of savages rushed out of the mountains and forests and, without saying a word, killed the Ryukyu sailors like chopping melons and vegetables..." (page 28), although this description is "vivid" (which is the author's intention), it is vivid to the point of being harmful. The author used his imagination of "savages", but this imagination may have come from the influence of the American barbaric Western movies slandering "redskins", which can no longer be used to spread to readers.

Editor's Note: This article points out some errors in historical materials and individual viewpoints in several histories of American imperialism's aggression against China. It should be admitted that although *A Brief History of American Aggression Against China*, *A History of American Imperialist Economic Aggression Against China*, and *A Short History of American Aggression Against China* provide us with some historical facts about American imperialism's aggression against China, they are not ideal works in terms of viewpoints and material collection; so far, we do not yet have a typical work on the history of American imperialism's aggression against China with correct content and rich materials, and such a work is urgently needed by us. From some pamphlets describing the history of American imperialism's aggression against China, a bad tendency in the writing community can be seen, that is, some authors are too unserious and not serious enough, do not patiently collect historical materials, do not patiently analyze problems, copy each other repeatedly, distort information, and write hastily. Typical examples of this attitude are Xuan Di's work, *One Hundred Years of American Imperialism's Aggression Against China* published by World Knowledge Press, and Xie Mu's compiled *A Century Summary of American Imperialist Aggression Policy* published by Chao Feng Publishing House. We plan to organize another article to be published in the next issue. It should also be added that *Early Historical Facts of American Imperialist Aggression Against China* by Gao Yihan et al., published by Guangming Daily Press, although it is a compilation of several fragmentary articles, can correctly expose some of the main historical facts of American imperialism's early aggression against China. This type of article is helpful to readers.

　　评六种美帝侵华史
    王大白
    一、刘大年著《美国侵华简史》新华书店一九四九年十一月初版
    二、钦本立著《美帝经济侵华史》  世界知识社一九五○年四月初版，一九五一年一月修订四版
    三、汪敏之著《美国侵华小史》  三联书店一九五○年八月初版
    四、北京师范大学工会历史系小组编著《美帝侵略中国史话》光明日报一九五○年十二月初版
    五、王春著《美国侵华史话》  工人出版社一九五一年一月初版
    六、施瑛编著《美帝侵华演义》  通联书店一九五一年一月初版
            《美国侵华简史》中的一些问题
    在我国出版物中，以正确观点全面地、系统地总结了一百余年来美国侵华政策和史实的第一本书，是刘大年在一九四八年十一月写成的《美国侵华简史》。本书从一九四九年十一月初版以来，截至本年一月北京六版和其他地区一九五○年十二月出版数字的统计，在全国范围内的累积印数达二三八、八○○册。这说明它是怎样受着广大读者的欢迎，它在中国人民的抗美斗争的教育中，起了怎样重要的作用。就它对著作界的影响来看，去年和本年一二两月陆续出版的几种讨论美国侵华历史的书籍中的观点和材料，极大部分是以本书为依据的。直到今天为止，在同性质的书籍中，它还是比较好的一种。
    然而本书因为最初写作时条件的困难，也还存在着若干缺点。后出的若干种书籍既然大体以本书为蓝本，本书中的错误就成为一再重复的错误了，这是不能不指出的。
    （一）“一八六二年美舰炮轰马关，取得日本的妥协”（书八页）。据各种史料纪载，美舰维奥明号在一八六三年曾单独轰击马关一次；此处所指应为美英荷法四国联合舰队轰击马关，迫使日本开放马关海峡、承认一八五八年的通商条约并允许英法在日本驻军这一事件，时间应为一八六四年。
    （二）“至一八六八年先后由皮雷与哈利斯帮助日本开辟商务和策划维新运动，”（同上页）作者在这里注明这一资料是引自“美苏考勒斯基著，赵公皎译：美国远东政策，外交月报，三卷三期。”笔者没有查考这一资料来源，但事实是：皮雷在一八五八年三月已死于纽约，哈利斯从一八五六年起任驻日领事六年，也在一八六二年四月回到美国。因此，这句话是不正确的。但如果说皮等对日本的开辟商务乃至一八六八年的维新运动有影响，是可以的。
    （三）“一八七二年美国……派军舰至朝鲜强迫与美国订立通商条约。”（同上页）正确的年份应为一八七一年。
    （四）“一八七三年……美国前驻福建领事李仙得……竟率领美军向台湾进攻，”（同上页）正确的年份应为一八六七年。陈恭禄著《中国近代史》有记载，一九五一年三月二日进步日报史学周刊第八期蔡美彪作《一八六七年台湾高山族的抗美卫国战争》，详细记述了这一件事。
    （五）“一八七四年……美日联合向台湾大举出兵。”（书九页）与史实不尽相符。李仙得曾参与此事，也曾介绍了两个美国人给日本人做顾问，但说美国“有陆军参加”就不正确。在若干后出的书中更说成“组织美日联军”，那就离事实更远了。
    （六）“一八七四年……，便辟台湾为商埠，”（同上页）是错误的。“台事专款三条”没有这一条。台湾之辟为通商口岸早在一八五八年的中美天津条约里就规定了，从那时起，美国已经获得了这一特权。因此，接下去所说的“美国利用日本达到了插足台湾，开辟市场的目的。”（书十页）也是多余的。
    （七）“天津海关税务司英人德璀琳……”（书十六页），德璀琳是德国人。
    （八）“美国著名的煤油托辣斯（即美孚油公司）是一九○○年成立的。”（书二十六页），依据各种记载，美孚油公司是在一八七○年成立的，它一开始即具有了托辣斯的性质。刘书虽有所据，但一八七○年是更确实的。
    （九）“……司戴德为美驻奉天总领事（原为路透社驻朝鲜访员，以侵华有功累升至此），……”（书二十八页），司戴德在一九○二——○四年间，曾在南京、北京我国海关任职，一九○五年任美国驻朝鲜公使私人秘书，指出他这一经历是更好的，因为这可以作为“侵华有功”一语的说明。
    （十）“一九二九年二月美国人克末勒获得‘财政顾问’，前此又有美国人甘梅尔获得财政部设计委员会主席兼银行币制专门委员，……”（书五五页），克米（末？——笔者）勒和甘梅尔原是一个人（即E.W.Kemmer），此人在一九二八年应蒋政权之聘来华，担任伪财政部顾问，并与其他所谓财政专家十二人组织了“财政设计委员会”，在一九三○年提出了一个所谓币制改革计划。
    （十一）书中另外也还有些需要改正的译名：（１）如书四页把Major Shaw译为“梅耶·萧”，这人是美国独立战争时一名少校，Major应义译少校；（２）“马瑞慕”在书中五四页和五五页凡二见，照音译，应为“马慕瑞”（Mac Murray），过去外交文献上译为“马克谟”；“中美‘汤格斯坦’借款”宜通称为“钨砂借款”。
            对《美帝经济侵华史》等五书的意见
    在这一节要进行讨论的著作，包括了文前书目顺序二至六等书。在这些著作中，汪敏之著《美国侵华小史》（以下简称汪著）和钦本立著《美帝经济侵华史》（简称钦著）是比较好的两本。钦著、汪著都出版较早，两书除采取了刘著若干史料和观点外，兼采了胡绳著《帝国主义与中国政治》一书的若干材料。两书也个别掘发了一些新的材料（如汪著关于早期中美通商和一九四八年以后的材料，钦著关于经济侵华的若干材料）。钦著在经济侵华方面作了较系统的叙述。汪著和钦著大体也做到“按照历史年代的顺序，讲述并分析了历史事件”的要求。但汪著、钦著都沿袭刘著的大部分错误。汪著的其他错误较少（但不是没有），钦著初版本以至三版本特有的错误很多，一九五一年一月的第四版虽已经作了大部分的修正，然而还保留了一些错误。
    钦、汪二著在与其同类的读物中，在出版时间上可以算是仅次于刘著的“先行者”，因此钦著有些错误又为后出的书所保留，例证可以从王春著《美国侵华史话》（简称王著）中找到。王著是把美国侵华史实，用比较通俗化的活泼生动的文笔加以纪述，鼓动性强，适合一般工农干部阅读，也是一本好书。但除了同类书的一般性史料错误外，也还有些个别错误。与王著同性质的书是施瑛编著的《美帝侵华演义》，这是依据刘著材料，用章回小说体改写的，因为是“述而不作”，特有的错误很少，但文字上有些缺点。
    北京师范大学工会历史系小组编著的《美帝侵略中国史话》是在抗美援朝运动中，依照《时事手册》第二期中的宣传提纲，作为学习资料而写成的，史料有些错误，用语也有几处不妥。
    下面将具体指出上举几本书中的错误和写作上的缺点。刘著中的若干错误为这些书所重复的，这里不再引证。
    （一）钦著（以一九五一年一月四版为据）：（１）“两广总督程矞”（书二页），应为程矞彩。（２）“中国新施与他国人民商业上的便利……”（同上页），“新”字为“所”字之误，这一字差别很大，是不能乱改的。（３）“美国供给英法薪饷一个月”（书四页），事实是：英法供给了美国军舰薪饷一个月，这个错误为王著所接受了（见王著十二页）。（４）“通商口岸增加八处”（书四页），依据中美天津条约，是通商口岸从五处增加到七处。（５）“到了一八九九年，英国已占有威海卫港口”（书七页），应为一八九八年。（６）“海约翰的照会提出后，英国首相张伯伦答复说，……”（书九页），那时的英国首相是在一八八五至一九○二年间三度组阁的沙律士伯雷（Marquis of Salisbury，即Bobert Ceeil），约瑟夫。张伯伦那时是沙律士伯雷内阁的殖民大臣。（７）“……美商和吴佩孚做了一笔大军火的买卖，步枪一万支，子弹二千万发……”，这一史料是从刘著引来的，刘著为“子弹二百万发”，钦著这一错误也为王著所沿用了（王著五八页）。（８）该书初版将一九三五（四？）年上海存银误为“四六亿元”（书五○页），曾经上海大公报“读书与出版”指出，王著改为“四亿六千万元”（书七七页），钦著修订本又改为“六亿元”，但这数字还是不正确的。据“申报年鉴”（二十四年版）所载一九二九年至一九三四年间上海存银的统计，最高量为一九三三年底之五四七、四四六、○○○元，在一九三四年下半期流出约三分之一，这一年底的存银量仅为三三四、九九七、○○○元。据此，可以判断“六亿元”是臆度的。笔者以为：如果并无确实根据，在修订时随便更改，这种修订也是不足取的。
    （二）汪著：（１）“美使华德（Frederic T.Ward）……”（书三六页）Fsederic T.Ward是在太平天国时组织洋枪队的流氓兼海盗华尔，这里所指的美使应该是John E.Ward，一般历史文献中译为华约翰，这里是搞错了强盗们的名字了。（２）“二十世纪三十年代是美国在中国采取攻势的十年”（书一○九页），“美国势力的扩展，到了四十年代开始时受到严重的顿挫”（书一一○页），按照现在通常的说法，“三十年代”和“四十年代”应为“二十年代”和“三十年代”之误。（３）汪著三十二页有一个“注”，说明“见蒋恭（误排为‘发’）晟著‘中美关系纪要’第六十四页”，三十八页只有一个“注”，注明“同上”，“同”哪一个“上”呢？经查对蒋书，原来三十二页的脚注应该移到三十八页，三十二页的注还查不出来源。而且汪著在这一个引文上是不忠实的。因为它把所引的桂良的话有改动，有删节，譬如把原文“当其请换约”改为“当其请约”（三十七页），这意义是不同的。
    （三）《美帝侵略中国史话》：（１）“一八七四年台湾的生番杀了五十四名琉球漂流的难民……”（书九页），第一是年代不符，第二“台湾的生番”一词太不妥。（２）“李仙得………卖‘纽约丸’及‘社疗丸’两条船给日本运兵………”（同上页）也不符事实。（３）“李仙得在一七八四年还公然作日本特命全权大使向天津办交涉………”（同上页），李仙得曾随日本全权大臣大久保利通来华，可是他并没有“公然作日本全权大使”。（４）“一九三一年六月，蒋介石又举行第四次，‘围剿’。”（书二十二页），“就在一九三一年美国帮助蒋介石对工农红军作第四次‘围剿’的时候………”（书二十四页），第四次“围剿”是在一九三二年六月，这里两次都说错了。
    （四）王著：（１）“美国又派了一个叫伯加的人，联合英人、法人重行提出修改条约的内容………”（书一○——一一页），著者提出了四点，但第一点（关于保护美船在各海口自由巡逻）已经列入望厦条约的第三十二条，第二点（领事裁判权）已列入同约第二十一及二十五等条，第四点（利益均沾）也在同约中有了规定，对第四点著者也在同书第二十一页自己说过“………第一是要求‘利益均沾’，这一开头就成功了，………”。其实这时美国政府要伯加提出要求的是另外三件事：一、美国外交官入驻北京；二、通商范围无限制扩大；三、废止一切限制美国人民在华活动的个人自由的禁令（见胡绳著：《帝国主义与中国政治》，页二十四，转引李抱宏：“中美外交关系”）。（２）“可是美国帝国主义却不肯白完，………结果是强迫满清政府开台湾为商埠，还赔款五千万两”（书二十页），“五千万两”是“五十万两”之误，而且这五十万两是赔给日本的，这里语意不明。（３）“原来美帝国主义侵略菲律宾的时候，陷入了和西班牙的抢夺战争”（书二十一页），这是与史实不符的，在美西战争时，西班牙军队的抵抗一下就垮了，美国陷入的是菲岛人民的抵抗不是“和西班牙的抢夺战争”。（４）“一八五七年天津条约规定……”（书四十六页）一句，是将原通牒的原句“……我国坚执一八五七年我国倡始之对华和平……政策”（见王芸生：“六十年来中国与日本”卷四，十六页）改写的，可是这样的改写就错了，因为天津条约是订于一八五八年。（５）“袁贼……便真正在一九一六年一月一日做起皇帝来了。这无耻的皇帝共做了六个月零六天，……”，袁世凯在一九一五年十二月十二日接受“皇帝推戴书”，次日便正式称帝了，预定在一九一六年一月一日“登极”却一直未成，到同年三月二十二日被迫撤销帝制，这里的说明是与历史不相符合的。（６）“一九○八年……两个侵略强盗签定了……‘高平、卢特’协定”（书三十三页），“……结果由美国代表路德替改为四条，……”（书五四页），这在一九○八年签订“高平、卢特协定”的卢特和华盛顿会议时拟订四原则的“路德”正是一个人（Elihu Root），为什么译成了两个人名呢？顺便可以提到的，王著常把一些比较通用的人名加以更改，如把顾兴（顾盛）改作“苦兴”，伯驾改成“伯加”，把芮恩思改成“瑞恩思”，实在并无必要，因为“顾”、“驾”、“芮”等字在同书中还是出现了的。
    （五）施著：“有一艘琉球海船，被风浪打到台湾海岸上，那批遭难的琉球水手登岸躲避，尚未站定脚跟，谁知山林里冲出一伙生番，不由分说，就把那批琉球水手，杀得砍瓜切菜一般，……”（书二十八页），这段描写虽是“生动的”（这是作者的企图），然而却生动到有害的地步了。作者运用了他对“生番”的想像，可是这想像可能是从美国野蛮的西部电影诬蔑“红番”的影响中得来的，这就不能再用来传播给读者了。
    编者按：这篇文章中指出了几本美帝国主义侵华史中的一些史料上的及个别观点上的错误。应当承认，《美国侵华简史》、《美帝经济侵华史》、《美国侵华小史》等书虽然提供给我们一些美帝国主义侵略中国的史实，但是无论就观点上及材料搜集上来说，都还不是理想的著作；到现在为止，我们还没有一本内容正确、材料丰富的典型的美帝国主义侵华史的著作，而这种著作，是我们所迫切需要的。从一些叙述美帝国主义侵华史的小册子中看出一个著作界的不良倾向，那就是有些作者太不严肃，太不认真，不耐心搜集史料，不耐心分析问题，辗转传抄，以讹传讹，顺笔一挥，潦草从事。这种态度的典型例子是宣谛之作，世界知识社出版的《美帝侵华一百年》及谢牧编著，潮锋出版社出版的《美帝侵华政策的百年总结》，我们打算另组织一篇文章在下期发表。还应该补充一点，高一涵等著、光明日报社出版的《美帝侵华初期史实》，虽然是编集了几篇零碎的文章，但能正确地揭发了美帝国主义早期侵略中国的一些主要史实，这类文章对读者是有帮助的。
