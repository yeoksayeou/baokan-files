　　Over Ten Thousand Women Participate in Railway Construction This Year

　　Over the past year, the number of women participating in the construction of the people's railways has reached more than 14,000, an increase of 60% compared to the end of 1949. Among them, in the Northeast Railway alone, there are more than 970 female workers directly involved in production, including drivers, stokers, repair workers, lathe operators, milling machine operators, gas workers, train electricians, crane operators, etc. In 1950, the number of female technicians in the Dalian Branch of the China Changchun Railway increased by 100% compared to 1949.

　　The women participating in railway construction have already achieved many outstanding results. In addition to the nationally renowned deeds of the Tian Guiying train crew, the female train crew on the Beijing-Tianjin line frequently receives praise from passengers for their responsible work. Wang Jingbin, a female telephone operator at the Andong Railway Branch, not only took the lead in persevering with her work under enemy bombing but also created the "6-3 system" of communication, which greatly improved the efficiency of telecommunications work. Qi Guizhi, a female milling machine operator who was once rated as a model worker in the entire Northeast Railway, has now begun to take on apprentices. In her remarks commemorating this year's March 8th International Women's Day, she said: "I never dreamed before that I could learn heavy industrial technology. Now I understand that if women want true liberation, they must learn technology." (Xinhua News Agency)

　　年来万余妇女参加铁路建设
    一年来参加人民铁路建设事业的妇女已达一万四千多人，较一九四九年底增加了百分之六十。其中仅在东北铁路直接参加生产的女工就有九百七十余人，包括司机、司炉、修车工、旋盘工、车床工、瓦斯工、车电员、吊车工等。中长铁路大连分局一九五○年的女技术人员，较一九四九年增加了一倍。
    参加铁路建设的妇女们，已经创造了不少优异的成绩。除田桂英乘务组的事迹已经闻名全国以外，京津线上的女车务包乘组，又以工作负责等事迹，经常获得旅客好评。安东铁路分局女电话员王静彬，不但在敌机轰炸下带头坚持工作，还创造了“六三制”通话办法，使电务工作效率提高了很多。曾被评为全东北铁路劳动模范的女旋盘工戚桂枝，现在已开始带徒弟了。她在纪念今年三八节的感言中说：“我从前做梦也想不到我能学会重工业技术。现在我懂得了妇女要求真正翻身，必须学会技术。”        （新华社）
