How to Understand the Korean War Situation
     Cao Liang
    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to fight the enemy more effectively, after dealing a severe blow to the American invading army and the Li Syngman bandit army that ventured north, took the initiative to withdraw from Seoul on the 14th of this month.
    The American aggressors' re-invasion of Seoul began on January 25th. The American invading army, which had been repeatedly defeated, scraped together all the forces it could find on the Korean battlefield, totaling 230,000 men, and also equipped them with a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks, vainly hoping that by relying on its superior equipment, it would be able to quickly recapture Seoul and then re-invade the area north of the 38th parallel. However, under the heroic and skillful resistance of the Chinese and Korean people's forces, the enemy's progress was extremely slow, and its losses were enormous. It took more than 40 days, lost more than 30,000 officers and soldiers, and consumed a large number of weapons, vehicles, and ammunition. Finally, it was only after the Chinese and Korean people's forces took the initiative to withdraw that it was able to invade Seoul.
    The American aggressors' reoccupation of Seoul has no impact on the overall war situation in Korea. Based on the rich experience of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War and the experience of the Korean War of Liberation, we know that the victory or defeat of a war is not determined by the gain or loss of a single city or place, but by the increase or decrease of living forces. In order to completely defeat the American aggressor army in Korea, it is necessary to make the annihilation of the enemy's living forces the main goal. Since the Chinese People's Volunteers began fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, they have been guided by the principle of annihilating the enemy's living forces in their operations. In the first campaign, from the end of October to the beginning of November last year, after the Chinese and Korean people's forces won the victory of annihilating more than 13,000 enemy troops, in order to annihilate the enemy in greater numbers, they took the initiative to retreat and withdraw from some areas, luring the enemy to advance rashly. As a result, they achieved the great victory of annihilating more than 34,000 enemy troops in the second campaign from the end of November to December last year. In the recent fourth campaign from late January to mid-February this year, the Chinese and Korean people's forces first withdrew from the Hengcheng area at the beginning of the campaign, and soon launched a counterattack, annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops in the Hengcheng area. Therefore, in order to achieve the main goal of annihilating the enemy's living forces, it is not only permissible, but also necessary, to take the initiative to withdraw from some cities and areas. Because in this way, we can fully grasp the initiative and create more favorable conditions for annihilating the enemy's living forces, and annihilate the enemy in mobile warfare.
    The gain or loss of Seoul has no meaning militarily, and it also has no meaning politically now. Because Seoul has now become an empty city with only tens of thousands of people. Even the head of the American aggressor army, the warmonger MacArthur himself, admitted with fear not long before the invasion of Seoul (March 7) that the advance of the American army was meaningless. He said: "If our army (referring to the American invading army) advances further in the future, then this action will be more beneficial to the enemy (referring to the Chinese and Korean people's forces) militarily than to our army." He also said: "As our front line moves north, the enemy's supply line will gradually shorten, thus making their numerical superiority on the ground more and more significant on the battlefield."
    Of course, the American aggressors' re-invasion of Seoul also shows that the Korean War is still a fairly long-term war, because although the American aggressors have suffered several major defeats in a row, they have not given up and are still stubbornly pursuing their policy of expanding aggression. Therefore, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army must be prepared to continue to annihilate the enemy's forces again and again in future operations, until the enemy can neither advance nor defend. Under such conditions, the people of our whole country must continue to popularize and deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, vigorously support the Chinese and Korean people's forces, and fight for the final and complete elimination of the American aggressor army in Korea.

　　怎样认识朝鲜战局
     操良
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，为了更有利地与敌人作战，在给了向北冒险侵犯的美国侵略军和李匪军以严重的打击以后，已于本月十四日主动地撤离汉城。
    美国侵略者这次对汉城的再度侵犯，是在一月二十五日开始的。已经一败再败的美国侵略军，又搜罗了在朝鲜战场上可以搜罗到的全部兵力，共计有二十三万之众，还配备了大量的飞机、大炮和坦克，妄想依靠他的优势装备，一定可以很快地重占汉城，并进而重新侵入北纬三十八度以北地区。但是在中朝人民部队的英勇而巧妙的抵抗下，敌人进展极慢，损失极大，花了四十多天的时间，损失了三万以上的官兵，消耗了大量的武器、车辆和弹药，最后还是在中朝人民部队主动撤离以后，才得以侵入汉城。
    美国侵略者的重新侵占汉城，对朝鲜的战争形势，是不起什么作用的。我们根据中国人民革命战争的丰富经验，以及朝鲜解放战争的经验，知道战争的胜败，不决定于一城一地的得失，而决定于有生力量的消长。为了在朝鲜完全打败美国侵略军，就必须以歼灭敌人的有生力量为主要目标。中国人民志愿军自从跟朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来，就是以歼灭敌人的有生力量为作战的指导方针。远的如在去年十月底到十一月初，中朝人民部队在得到歼敌一万三千多人的第一次战役的胜利以后，为了更大量地歼灭敌人，曾主动地后退了一些，撤离了一些地方，诱敌冒进；从而又于去年十一月底至十二月间取得了第二次歼敌三万四千多人的大胜利。近的如在今年一月下旬至二月中旬的第四次战役中，中朝人民部队在战役之初，先退出了横城地区，不久即举行反攻，就在横城地区歼灭了敌军一万多人。因此，为了达到歼灭敌人有生力量的这个主要目的，主动地撤离一些城市和地区，不仅是可以的，而且也是必要的。因为这样，就可以完全掌握主动，创造更多地歼灭敌人有生力量的有利条件，在运动中歼灭敌人。
    汉城的得失，不仅在军事上没有什么意义，在政治上现在也没有什么意义。因为汉城现在已成为一座只有几万人的空城了。甚至美国侵略军首脑战争贩子麦克阿瑟自己，在侵占汉城前不久（三月七日）也恐惧地承认美军的前进是无意义的。他说：“今后我军（指美国侵略军）如再前进的话，那么这种行动在军事上对敌军（指中朝人民部队）有利的程度，将比对我军为甚。”他又说：“随着我军战线的北移，敌军的补给线将逐渐缩短，因而使它们的地面部队的数量上的优势在战场上的意义，越来越大。”
    当然，美国侵略者再度侵占汉城的行动，也说明了朝鲜战争还是一场相当长期的战争，因为美国侵略者虽然已经接连吃了几次大败仗，但是并没有死心，它还一意孤行，继续冒险进犯，坚持扩大侵略的政策。因此，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军就必须准备在今后的作战中，一次又一次地继续歼灭敌人的力量，直到敌人既不能进又不能守的时候为止。在这样的条件下，我全国人民必须继续普及深入抗美援朝的爱国运动，大力支援中朝人民部队，为最后彻底消灭在朝鲜的美国侵略军而斗争。（转载《时事手册》第十一期）
