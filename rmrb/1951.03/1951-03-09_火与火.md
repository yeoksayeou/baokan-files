　　Fire and Fire
　　Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Wei Wei

　　In Korea, if you are someone who has never been to Korea before, you can no longer see what Korea originally looked like. So many towns and villages have been turned into scorched earth mixed with white snow under the indiscriminate bombing of American planes. These places, built and inhabited by hardworking Koreans for generations, where their children sang and danced, now only remain as names on military maps. But, I want to tell you that what this gives the Korean people is definitely not fear and desolation, but something else. This thing, like the stubborn, endless mountains of Korea, stands in every piece of land in all of Korea, and its name is "Hatred."

　　On a snowy night, we rushed to Huichon. It used to be a bustling city, but now, on the scorched earth covered with white snow, only a solitary clock tower and a few broken walls can be seen. Even so, it is said that American planes still bomb it several times a day. I really don't know what else they want to bomb here!

　　In order to find a place to rest, we had to find a family in a nearby gully. This "home" was a temporary shelter made by refugees from Huichon, who dug a few pits on the hillside and built them with branches and straw.

　　Here, we met a child named Liu Binglie. Although this child was only thirteen years old, he sat silently beside us like an adult. Before the war, his father was a worker, and he studied at a nearby middle school. In those golden days, he had sweetly thought about studying hard and becoming a useful person to build his country into a country without poor people. But his school was bombed, and he lost his education. Then, his home was bombed. On the day it was bombed, he saw for the first time more than thirty scattered corpses lying around him. Speaking of this, his eyes shot out fire. He said fiercely: "They destroyed our cities and villages, and even bombed small children who can't speak. I want to kill all those guys, bite them all to death!" Why does he hate the American aggressors so much? He pointed to Huichon and said, "Look!" When we asked him about his hopes for the future, he said without hesitation: "I want to be a soldier in the People's Army." But we said, "You're not old enough!" He lowered his head in depression. Hatred has matured this thirteen-year-old child. His eyes shone on us, so somber and firm. It made us not dare to believe that the one sitting next to us was a child.

　　Twenty miles north of Sunchon, in a small village called Jinguli, I met a seventy-year-old mother. On the night we stayed there, she held her grandson in her arms, sitting up all night, covering us with the coats that had slipped off our bodies. When we woke up the next day, she was still guarding us like a mother. She was wearing white clothes and a white skirt, and her hair was already white.

　　When we asked her if there were any other people in her family, the old mother leaned closer to me, looking at us with an extremely painful expression. She said: Her twenty-seven-year-old son was killed by the American devils. They found him from a gully, beat him until his eyes didn't turn, and then smashed him to death with stones. She used her two withered hands to gesture the scene of her son's tragic death. She recalled and narrated that her son was such a smart and honest person, working in harmony and laughing every day. Their family lived such a happy life. But now, only his old mother, a daughter-in-law, and a child who cannot speak are left. Speaking of this, the old mother leaned forward, grabbed my two hands deeply with her two dry hands, and said loudly to my face: "Children! Avenge me, quickly catch the murderer who killed my son, beat them to death, tear them to pieces!" She seemed afraid that we could not hear clearly, and grabbed everyone's hands, patted everyone's chest and said it again. In the dry eye sockets of her old age, there were a few tears that seemed to flash with fire, dripping onto our cotton-padded sleeves. I know that these are not ordinary tears, these are fire beads of hatred.

　　Near Pyongyang, I also met a Korean journalist. His name is Kim No-ting. His injured hand is still bandaged, and there are bullet marks on his boot. When he was retreating, he was with the refugees and trekked for twenty-five days, traveling one thousand seven hundred li, and was surrounded twenty times, but he is still alive. When we asked about his family, he said that he had a young and lovely wife and two children. His wife is a famous singer in Korea. But until now, he still doesn't know the news of his wife and children. When he narrated the situation of his family, although he was smiling, he is now in pain. He also said: "We worked hard to build for five years, but now it has been destroyed by the enemy. I now only have a gun, a pen, and a notebook. I don't want to go home now, and I don't want to think about my lover and children. There is only one thing in my heart, and that is revenge and victory." This is the voice of a Korean intellectual. It is a strong voice containing painful hatred.

　　On the Korean battlefield, the foolish enemy thought that they could conquer this white-clothed nation with their bombs and fire. But they don't know that every bomb they drop, every drop of blood dripping from their shrapnel, has turned into boundless hatred. The flame of hatred in the hearts of the Korean people is much stronger than the invaders' incendiary bombs. It is this fire that drives every soldier of the People's Army and the Volunteer Army to advance regardless of life and death. It is this fire that makes countless Korean women and old people, wearing thin clothes and straw sandals, repair roads, transport supplies, and support the army in the icy and snowy weather, annihilating the American aggressors. It is this fire that makes thousands of Korean mothers dedicate their sons. I saw with my own eyes: In Wenjing, a mother who had sent two sons to the army, in front of me, pointed to her sixteen-year-old son and an eighteen-year-old girl, and wanted to send them to the People's Army as well. It is this fire, this fire that will keep burning the invading beasts to death. This is not a spark, this is an boundless fire, an overwhelming fire, a fire that no force can extinguish.

　　火与火
    本报特约记者  魏巍
    在朝鲜，倘若你是一个从前并没有到过朝鲜的人，你已经再也不能看到朝鲜原来是什么样子了。多少城镇和乡村，在美机滥炸下，已经成了混着白雪的焦土。勤劳的朝鲜人，他们世世代代建筑的居住的这些地方，他们的子女歌唱过舞蹈过的这些地方，现在只是在军用地图上留下了一个名字。可是，我要告诉你，这给朝鲜人民的，决不是恐惧和凄凉，而是另一种东西。这种东西，像朝鲜那些倔强的无尽的峰峦一样，站立在全朝鲜的每一块地方，它的名字叫做“仇恨”。
    在一个雪夜，我们赶到了熙川。它过去曾是热闹的城市，现在，在拥着白雪的焦土上，只能看到一座孤零零的钟楼和几扇断墙。即使这样，据说美机每天还要轰炸几次。我真不知道它们还要在这里轰炸什么东西！
    为了找一个歇脚处，我们不得不在附近的山沟里找了一个人家。这个“家”，是熙川的难民临时在山坡上挖了几个坑，用树枝和稻草搭成的窝棚。
    在这里，我们遇到了一个名叫刘秉烈的孩子。这个孩子，虽然只有十三岁，但却像成年人一样地沉默着坐在我们的身边。战前，他的父亲是工人，他就在附近的中学校里读书。在那些黄金色的日子里，他曾甜蜜的想过，要好好学习，成为一个有用的人，把自己的国家，建设成为一个没有穷人的国家。但是，他的学校被炸毁了，他失了学。接着，他的家又被炸毁了。在被炸的那一天，他第一次看到了三十多具零乱的尸体，倒在他的周围。说到这里，他的眼睛射出火光。他狠狠地说：“他们毁灭了我们的城市和乡村，连不会说话的小孩子也炸。我要把那些家伙，全打死，全咬死！”他为什么这样仇恨美国侵略者呢？他用手指着熙川说：“你们看吧！”当我们问到他今后的希望的时候，他毫不犹豫地说：“我要当一个人民军战士。”可是我们说：“你的年龄是不够的呀！”他愁闷地低下了头。仇恨，使这个十三岁的孩子成熟了。他的眼光照射着我们，是这样地沉郁和坚强。使我们不敢相信，坐在我们身边的是一个孩子。
    在顺川北二十里，一个叫金谷里的小庄，我遇到了一个七十岁的老妈妈。当我们住在那里的那天夜里，她怀里抱着她的孙子，一整夜坐着，给我们盖好从身上滚落的大衣。等到第二天我们醒来的时候，她还像母亲般地守着我们。她穿着白衣白裙，头发也已经白了。
    当我们问到她家里还有什么人时，老妈妈往我身边凑了凑，眼睛望着我们，带着极痛苦的表情。她说：她的二十七岁的儿子，被美国鬼子杀死了。他们是把他从山沟里找出来，打得眼珠都不转的时候，又用石头砸死的。她用两只枯老的手比划着她儿子惨死时的情形。她回想着，叙说她的儿子是那样一个又聪明又老实的人，一天和和气气地、有说有笑地劳动着。她们家是那样幸福地生活着。可是现在，只剩下了他的一个老娘，一个媳妇和一个不会说话的孩子。说到这里，老妈妈身向前倾，两只干枯的手深深的抓住我的两只手，对着我的脸大声地说：“孩子们！你们给我报仇呀，你们快抓住杀我儿子的凶手吧，你们把他们打死，撕碎吧！”她好像怕我们听不清楚，又抓住每个人的手，拍着每个人的胸口说了一遍。她的老年人的干枯的眼窝里，有几粒似乎闪着火光的眼泪，滴到我们的袄袖上。我知道这不是普通的眼泪，这是仇恨的火珠。
    在平壤附近，我还遇到一个朝鲜的新闻记者。他的名字叫金路丁。他的炸伤的手现在还缠着绷带，他的靴筒上还有着弹痕。他在撤退的时候，和难民在一起，徒步跋涉了二十五天，走了一千七百里路，被包围了二十次，但他还活着。当我们问到他的家庭时，他说，他有着一个年轻可爱的妻子和两个孩子。他的妻子是朝鲜一个有名的歌手。可是直到现在还不知道他妻子和孩子的消息。当他叙述他的家庭的情形时，虽然他是在笑着说着，但是现在他是痛苦的。他又说：“我们辛苦建设了五年，但现在却被敌人炸毁了。我现在只有一支枪，一支笔，一个本子。我现在也不想家，也不想我的爱人和孩子，我心里只有一个东西，就是复仇和胜利。”这是一个朝鲜知识分子的声音。是包含着痛苦的仇恨的刚强的声音。
    在朝鲜战场上，愚蠢的敌人，以为用他的炸弹和火可以征服这个穿白衣的民族。但他们不知道，他们扔下的每一颗炸弹，从他们的弹片上滴落的每一滴血，都变成了无边的仇恨。朝鲜人心里的仇恨的火焰，比侵略者的烧夷弹更要强烈得多。就是这种火，推动着每一个人民军和志愿军的战士，不顾生死地前进。就是这种火，使得无数的朝鲜妇女和老人，穿着单薄的衣服和草鞋，在冰天雪地里修路、运输、支援军队，歼灭美国侵略者。就是这种火，使得千千万万朝鲜的母亲们，献出她们的儿子。我亲眼看到：在温井，一个送过两个儿子参军的母亲，当着我的面，指着她的一个十六岁的儿子和一个十八岁的姑娘，也要把他们送到人民军去。就是这种火，这种火要一直把侵略的野兽们烧死为止。这不是星星之火，这是无边的火，排山倒海的火，任何力量不可能扑灭的火。
