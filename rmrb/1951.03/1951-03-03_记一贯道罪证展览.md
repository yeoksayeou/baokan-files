Record of the Exhibition of Evidence of the I-Kuan Tao's Crimes
    Mao Zhifan Zhang Zongde

    Since the "Exhibition of Evidence of I-Kuan Tao Crimes" in Beijing began on January 14th, long lines of visitors have filled the walkway to the Water Pavilion in Zhongshan Park every day. In this line, there are citizens, peasant women, shop assistants, people from Tianjin, Baoding, Tongxian and other places, as well as personnel from factories, organizations, and schools who come in groups. All these people want to see what the I-Kuan Tao really is and how it deceives people.

    As the lines of people gradually enter the exhibition halls, the mystery of how the I-Kuan Tao deceives people is gradually revealed.

    In the first and third exhibition halls, countless properties, gold bars, silver dollars, gold bracelets, and precious antiques are displayed, as well as opium smoking sets and fruit squeezers. The visitors are suddenly surprised by this unexpected discovery: "So much gold, silver, and property!" In fact, the properties displayed here are only a small part of the wealth that the I-Kuan Tao leader Zhang Guangbi swindled from his followers under the names of "joining the Tao fee" and "merit Tao fee." In 1947, when Zhang Guangbi and Sun Suzhen went from Beijing to Chongqing, they took away more than 15,000 taels of gold in one trip. But from the current exhibits, it can also be seen how licentious, shameless, and extravagant the I-Kuan Tao culprits were. They formulated "Tao rules" prohibiting Taoists from smoking or drinking, but they themselves indulged in alcohol and opium, and there were erotic paintings on their smoking sets. They were too lazy to chew fruit, so they squeezed out the juice with fruit squeezers to drink.

    People crowded into the second exhibition hall. Here are displayed various proofs of the I-Kuan Tao's counter-revolutionary activities. As early as the period of the Japanese puppet regime, the I-Kuan Tao leaders colluded with the Japanese invaders and traitors, promoting "Sino-Japanese friendship" and "East Asian Co-prosperity." The I-Kuan Tao criminal Zhang Guangbi served as an advisor to the puppet Wang Jingwei government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time; the big traitors Chu Minyi, Zhou Fohai, Wang Yitang, Jiang Chaozong and others were I-Kuan Tao point transmitters or altar leaders. They colluded with each other to harm the Chinese people. The exhibition hall has a total of thirty-nine "letters of appointment" stamped with Chiang Kai-shek's seal, given to the I-Kuan Tao leaders, and some special agent training certificates. This is clear evidence of the I-Kuan Tao's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in carrying out counter-revolution. Before the liberation of Beijing, the "Repentance Class" run by I-Kuan Tao leader Sun Suzhen even used the "Twelve Articles of Conduct for Kuomintang Members" to train Taoists, asking them to serve as Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs wholeheartedly. After the liberation of Beijing, the I-Kuan Tao continued its anti-people activities. Displayed here is Sun Suzhen's "handwritten order." The content of the "handwritten order" is to instigate Taoists to resist the People's Government and lurk to carry out special agent activities. Many of the reactionary rumors after liberation came from the I-Kuan Tao. After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the I-Kuan Tao leaders fabricated rumors such as "the world war has begun" and "the American and Chiang's troops are coming to Beijing." These criminals also dreamed of restoration. Altar leader Liu Yongfu made a Kuomintang national flag, and point transmitter Zhang Zhenchuan also prepared an American flag. After the Beijing Municipal People's Government explicitly banned the I-Kuan Tao on December 19 last year, the criminals formulated "Nineteen Articles for Responding to Demonic Tests," fooling Taoists to deal with the "big exam"; they told Taoists to rather be their victims and even sacrifice the lives and properties of their entire families to preserve the "Tao," and not to reveal the names of the Tao leaders and the "Three Treasures." The narrator in the second exhibition hall introduced the above materials in detail to the audience and pointed out the pistols, bullets, and radio transmitting and receiving sets that were searched from the Tao leaders' homes. The reactionary nature of the I-Kuan Tao has now been fully exposed to the masses.

    "What exactly is 'planchette writing'? How can a child write rhyming oracles with their eyes closed and holding a planchette?" The visitors walked into the square south of the Water Pavilion with a belly full of doubts. A mat shed was set up against the east side of the square. At the bottom of the shed, on a platform, was a "Buddhist Hall." The luxurious tables, chairs, and utensils were all confiscated from the I-Kuan Tao's Beijing general altar and are now displayed as they were. This is a mobile exhibition, where "point transmitters," "altar leaders," and "three talents" who have repented take turns performing every day, exposing the tricks of the "Three Treasures" and "planchette writing," and exposing the I-Kuan Tao leaders' crimes of deceiving people, swindling money, raping women, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. Many Taoists in the audience, when they saw the ugly state of "transmitting the Three Treasures," recalled their own ignorance and ridiculousness when they first entered the Tao. In the past, they had kowtowed a lot, just like the performers, before the point transmitter passed on the "Gate, Secret, and Seal Three Treasures." They really believed that the "Three Treasures" could bring good fortune in times of trouble, and that speaking about them would result in "being struck by lightning," but now they have figured it out. When the "three talents" performed "planchette writing," they wrote: "The I-Kuan Tao is full of evil deeds..." They revealed to the audience: "...The oracles I wrote in the past were all things that the point transmitter, altar leader, and I had investigated in advance, and then compiled into verses, which I wrote down with my eyes closed. I have been practicing "three talents" for six or seven years, and I have never felt a "god" possessing me..."

    The performers' personal testimonies aroused great anger among the audience towards the I-Kuan Tao. An old lady named Li Xiuqing was so angry that her whole body trembled. She went on stage to accuse the Tao leader of how he had deceived her husband (Zhang Fuqing) into joining the Tao, how the altar leader said that he had a connection with the immortals, how her husband had sold all four of their houses and gave the money to the altar leader as a "Tao transmission fee," and how the "Old Mother" instructed him to go to the southwest mountains to cultivate Buddhism, and he has never been heard from since. Many Taoists also recounted on the spot their experiences of being deceived and the damages they had suffered.

    The true nature of the I-Kuan Tao is thus shamefully exposed to the masses. Since the I-Kuan Tao crime evidence exhibition began, it has been extended repeatedly. As of the February 15th statistics, in one month, the number of visitors has exceeded 200,000. Many Taoists have written in the opinion book: "I was deceived in the past," "I am now awakened," and hope that a withdrawal point will be set up at the exit. In addition, "extending the exhibition time" and "making films and propaganda manuals" have become common demands of the masses. The relevant authorities are studying and dealing with these opinions of the masses. The enthusiastic situation during the exhibition not only shows the wisdom of the People's Government's measures to thoroughly destroy reactionary Taoist societies, but also educated the masses and raised their vigilance against the enemy through this exhibition.

　　记一贯道罪证展览
    毛之范　张宗德
    北京市“一贯道罪证展览”，自一月十四日开始以来，中山公园内通往水榭的走道上，每天都排满了长长的观众行列。在这个行列里，有市民、农妇、店员，有从天津、保定、通县等地赶来的外地人，也有集体前来的工厂、机关、学校的人员。这些人都想看一看一贯道到底是个什么东西，它怎样骗人。
    人的行列，一段段地卷入展览室，这个一贯道骗人的谜也就被一段段地揭破了。
    在第一、第三展览室里，陈列着数不尽的财物、金砖、银元、金手镯、珍贵的古玩，还有大烟具、榨果器。参观的人们为这意外的发现而突然一惊：“这么多金银和财物！”实际上，这里陈列的财物，还仅是一贯道头子张光璧用“入道费”、“功道费”等名目，骗取道徒的财物的一小部分。一九四七年，张光璧与孙素真由北京去重庆，一次曾带走了一万五千多两黄金。但从现在的陈列品中也可以看出，一贯道的罪魁们是怎样荒淫无耻和挥霍无度。他们制订了“道规”，不许道徒们吃烟、喝酒，他们自己却酗酒，抽鸦片，而且烟具上还有春宫画。他们吃水果懒得用牙嚼，用榨果器榨出汁来喝。
    人们拥进了第二展览室。这里陈列着一贯道进行反革命活动的种种罪征。早在日伪时期，一贯道头子即与日寇、汉奸相互勾结，宣传“中日亲善”、“东亚共荣”。一贯道罪魁张光璧，当时充任汪精卫汉奸政府外交部的顾问；大汉奸褚民谊、周佛海、王揖唐、江朝宗等又是一贯道的点传师或坛主。他们狼狈为奸，残害中国人民。展览室里共有三十九件有着蒋匪中正戳记的给一贯道道首的“委任状”和一些特务训练证明书。这是一贯道勾结蒋匪帮进行反革命的明证。北京解放之前，一贯道头子孙素真开办的“忏悔班”，更以“国民党党员守则十二条”来训练道徒，要他们死心蹋地地充当蒋介石的走狗。北京解放后，一贯道仍继续其反人民的活动。这里陈列着孙素真的“手谕”。“手谕”的内容是：策动道徒对抗人民政府，并潜伏进行特务活动。解放后的反动谣言，很多都是从一贯道中散出。美帝国主义发起侵朝战争之后，一贯道头子们制造了“世界大战已起”，“美蒋军要来北京”等谣言。这些罪犯还梦想复辟，坛主刘永福制成了一幅国民党国旗，点传师张镇川也准备了一幅美国国旗。去年十二月十九日，北京市人民政府明令取缔一贯道以后，罪魁们又制订了“应付魔考十九条”，愚弄道徒应付“大考”；让道徒宁肯作他们的牺牲品乃至牺牲全家的生命财产，来保全“道”，不许说出道首和“三宝”。第二陈列室里的说明员，向观众详细介绍了上述材料，并指点给观众看从道首家中搜出来的手枪、子弹和收、发报机。一贯道的反动本质，至此已完全暴露在群众面前了。
    “‘扶乩’是怎样一回事呢？一个小孩子怎么能闭目横书，写出押韵的乩语来？”参观者满腹狐疑地走进了水榭以南的广场。靠广场东边搭着一个席棚，棚底台上，是一个“佛堂”。豪华的桌椅用具，都是从一贯道北京总坛那里查抄来的，现在又原样陈列起来。这里是活动展览，每天由悔悟了的“点传师”、“坛主”、“三才”轮番表演，揭露“三宝”与“扶乩”的鬼把戏，揭露一贯道道首骗人、骗财、强奸妇女及从事反革命活动的罪行。观众中有很多道徒看见“传三宝”的丑态时，想起自己入道之初的愚昧可笑。过去自己也像表演者一样，磕了不少头，点传师才传给了“关、诀、印三宝”。自己也真认为“三宝”可以使人遇难成祥，说了便遭“五雷轰顶”，现在才弄了个清楚。“三才”表演“扶乩”时写了：“恶贯满盈一贯道……。”他们向观众揭发说：“……从前我写的乩语都是点传师、坛主和我，事先调查好的事情，编成诗句，由我迷着眼背着写下来的。我练“三才”已经六、七年了，从来也没有觉出“神”来附体……。”
    表演者的现身说法，引起观众对一贯道的极大愤恨。一个叫李秀卿的老太太，气得混身抖成一团，上台控诉了道首如何骗她丈夫（张福清）入道，坛主如何说他有仙缘，丈夫如何把四所房子都卖光，把钱送给坛主做了“传道费”，如何“老母”指示他到西南山去修佛，一去无音信。有不少道徒也当场诉说了被骗经过及所受的损害。
    一贯道的真实本质，就这样丑恶地裸现在群众面前。一贯道罪证自开始展览以来，一再延期，截至二月十五日的统计，一个月内，观众已超过二十万人。许多道徒曾在意见簿上写着：“我过去受骗了”，“我现在觉悟了”，并希望在出口处设立退道处。此外，“延长展览时间”、“拍成电影，制成宣传手册”等已成为群众的普遍要求。群众的这些意见，有关机关正研究处理。从展览时期的热烈情况，不但说明了人民政府彻底摧毁反动道会门措施的英明，且通过这次展览，教育了群众，提高了群众对敌人的警惕。
