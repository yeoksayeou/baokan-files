　　Tianjin's Experiences in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Worth Learning From
　　Zhèn Kūn

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Tianjin has entered a more widespread and in-depth phase since the city-wide Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference on March 1st. Tianjin's experiences are worth learning from for other cities.

　　The Tianjin Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference was convened on the basis of work carried out in the period before March. A total of two thousand two hundred and fifty-five representatives attended, including representative figures from all walks of life, as well as many activists who emerged from the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The conference summarized the gains of the past four months of the movement and put forward future tasks, passed a resolution to mobilize people from all walks of life throughout the city to universally formulate and implement patriotic pacts, and decided to continue in-depth patriotic education on this basis, with opposing the United States' arming of Japan, supporting the resolutions and declarations of the Peace Council, and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship as the specific content of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the future. The conference elected the second committee of the Tianjin Resist America, Aid Korea Association, expanding the number of original members, and expanding and consolidating the patriotic united front. Thus, the conference became a very broad and powerful mobilization to promote and expand the city-wide Resist America, Aid Korea movement. This experience proves that convening large-scale Resist America, Aid Korea representative conferences is a very effective method of mobilizing the masses.

　　At this representative conference, the speeches of representatives from all aspects were very enthusiastic. Zhu Jisheng, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles, said: "Industrial and commercial people are originally members of the bourgeoisie, and they have always been apprehensive. However, after two years of study since liberation, their political consciousness has also been raised. Moreover, seeing that today's government is a truly people's government, and all policies represent the interests of the people, they will never lag behind in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement." Wan Fuen, captain of the Tianjin Volunteer Medical Team, reported on the work of the medical team. He pointed out that the members of the volunteer medical team at the front were very hardworking because they realized that it was an honor to serve the soldiers resisting America and aiding Korea. He guaranteed that Tianjin medical workers would continue to go to the front one after another until the American aggressors were driven out of Korea. Of particular educational significance to everyone was the report given at the meeting by Ji Bingqian, a representative of the returning volunteers. He used concrete facts to illustrate how arduous and heroic the Chinese People's Volunteers were in combat. Many people were moved to tears, saying, "It's like seeing relatives we haven't seen for many years." After the meeting, many representatives conveyed the message to the masses to which they belonged, and "failure to step up the resistance to America and aid to Korea would let down the volunteer soldiers" became an important driving force for promoting various tasks.

　　After this conference, in places where the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has already been carried out, the movement is being further deepened into practical work and life, and those who were not involved in the movement in the past have also begun to actively participate. The results of the conference proved that it is very effective to adopt such an organizational form to promote and expand the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

　　On March 4th, women from all walks of life in the city held a demonstration and parade of more than 50,000 people resisting America, aiding Korea, and opposing the United States' arming of Japan. This was an unprecedented gathering of women in Tianjin. Many old ladies who never went out were also excited to participate in the parade, shouting slogans together with young girls. At the meeting, women from all walks of life in the city passed a common patriotic pact. After the meeting, women from all factories, schools, agencies, and streets in the city formulated their own patriotic pacts. Everyone proposed to commemorate "March 8th" with practical actions to strengthen the resistance to America and aid to Korea, and "to implement the Resist America, Aid Korea movement into practical life."

　　After universally denouncing the crimes of the United States in arming Japan, workers throughout the city expressed their patriotic determination by strengthening patriotic competitions and responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. Workers in each factory also put forward production guarantees and patriotic pacts for their groups. Even private enterprises that were generally not easy to carry out competitions in the past, especially small and medium-sized factories among them, after the publicity and education on resisting America, aiding Korea, and opposing the United States' arming of Japan, the concerns of the capitalists were dispelled, the workers' awareness and production enthusiasm were further improved, and competitions were also launched one after another. Of the twenty industrial trade unions in the city, nine already have seven hundred and eighty-five groups that have responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. Recently, in conjunction with the implementation of labor protection regulations, various factories and enterprises have launched a broad patriotic propaganda campaign, and are preparing to gradually deepen the impact of the propaganda and education to every factory, every person, and every family member.

　　On March 11th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin and more than 30,000 students from Tianjin held a demonstration against the United States rearming Japan. Soldiers and students formed nine large teams to carry out activities before the meeting. In order to make regular patriotic education more in-depth, schools are now preparing to further strengthen the content of political classes.

　　On March 9th, the Federation of Industry and Commerce convened the chairmen of 122 trade associations, conveyed the resolution of the city-wide Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference, and immediately established a committee to oppose the U.S. imperialists arming Japan and to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Since mid-February, Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles had universally denounced the various abuses and persecutions they suffered during the past Japanese occupation, as well as the exploitation and suppression encountered after the U.S. imperialists came along with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Under the unified leadership and auspices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, denunciations are now being carried out by industry, and then a large-scale city-wide representative conference of thousands of people will be held for large-scale denunciations. In conjunction with the denunciations, Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles are enriching the four guarantees that were previously put forward and holding "determination meetings" to ensure their implementation.

　　On March 11th, Tianjin's literary and art circles held a city-wide mobilization meeting, attended by more than 2,000 literary, music, art, and drama workers. They unanimously passed a patriotic pact, guaranteeing to use various forms of literature and art to cultivate the people's patriotism and internationalism, strengthen criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, and strive to create new people's literature and art. More than 1,000 members of the performing arts circles, who had suffered from the bullying of the Japanese, American, and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, also unanimously passed a patriotic pact after listening to the transmission of the representative conference and denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. They guaranteed to actively carry out patriotic propaganda activities and not to perform dramas and performing arts that violate the interests of the people.

　　The patriotic reform movement in religious circles also made new progress in March. Huo Peixiu, a representative of Christianity, proposed at the city-wide Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference that religious circles should oppose the United States' arming of Japan by strengthening the self-reliance reform movement, which is a general goal. To be self-reliant, it is first necessary to sever ties with imperialism, which inevitably leads to an exceptionally fierce struggle. The struggle in the Tianjin Catholic self-reliance reform movement is particularly intense and has now made significant progress. All Chinese priests in the city have signed the declaration of the self-reliance reform movement. Many believers, priests, and church school students and teachers have launched denunciation movements, exposing the crimes of imperialism in using religion for aggression. In the past, some Catholic students who were not very active in resisting America and aiding Korea have gradually realized the hideous face of imperialism and awakened, and have waged a head-on struggle with imperialist foreign bishops and foreign priests. This experience is worth learning from nationwide. More than 300 Buddhists in the city also signed patriotic pacts. Taoists within the jurisdiction of the Xiaohongqiao Police Station in the Seventh District also proposed to participate in the resistance to America and aid to Korea with practical actions.

　　After participating in the city-wide medical community demonstration, the traditional Chinese medicine community held a conference of more than 600 people on March 12 and formulated five patriotic pacts.

　　In addition, all districts in the city also conveyed the resolutions of the Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference at representative conferences of various circles held in March, and formulated or supplemented district-wide patriotic pacts. After the conference, the representatives of the Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference, district representatives, and resident representatives convened mass meetings or representative meetings of industries or regions in many places in the district to convey the resolutions of the representative conferences of various circles, and at the same time study how they should implement the pacts. This method of conducting education step by step through conferences is also proving to be very effective for unorganized masses and street residents.

　　Under the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, the masses of all strata, industries, and organizations in the city are currently being further mobilized. In order to ensure that every place and everyone receives patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea, to further popularize and develop the city-wide movement, and to welcome the "May 1st" grand demonstration, the Tianjin Resist America, Aid Korea Association has formulated a new plan, deciding to prepare at the end of March and fully launch in April to welcome the arrival of a new upsurge in the city-wide resistance to America and aid to Korea.

　　天津市抗美援朝运动的经验值得学习
    镇坤
    天津市的抗美援朝运动，在三月一日全市抗美援朝代表会议以后，开始了一个更加普及与深入的阶段。天津市的经验值得旁的城市学习。
    天津市抗美援朝代表会议是在三月以前一个时期工作开展的基础上召开的。到会的共有二千二百五十五名代表，除各阶层各方面的代表人物外，还有许多在抗美援朝运动中涌现出来的积极分子。这次会议总结了过去四个月运动的收获并提出了今后的任务，通过了发动全市各界人民普遍订立和贯彻爱国公约的决议，同时决定在这一基础之上继续进行深入的爱国教育，以反对美国武装日本、拥护和平理事会的决议和宣言及坚决镇压反革命、巩固人民民主专政作为今后抗美援朝运动的具体内容。会上选出了天津抗美援朝会的第二届委员会，扩充了原有委员名额，扩大和巩固了爱国统一战线。这样，会议就成为推动和扩大全市抗美援朝运动的一次非常广泛而强有力的动员。这个经验，证明召集大规模的抗美援朝代表会议是一个极有效力的动员群众的方法。
    在这次代表会上，各方面的代表的发言都十分热烈。工商界代表朱继圣说：“工商界人士本是资产阶级，向多顾虑。但自解放两年来经过学习，政治觉悟亦已提高。而且眼看今日的政府是真正人民的政府，一切政策乃是代表人民利益的政策，所以在抗美援朝爱国运动中决不肯落在人后。”天津志愿医疗队队长万福恩报告了医疗队工作情况。他指出，志愿医疗队的队员们在前方，由于认识到为抗美援朝的战士服务是光荣的，工作都很努力。他保证天津医务工作者今后将一批接着一批地开往前线，直到把美国侵略者赶出朝鲜为止。对大家教育意义特别大的是志愿军归国代表稽炳前在会上的报告。他用具体的事实说明中国人民志愿军在作战中，是如何艰苦，又是如何英勇。许多人感动得流了泪，说“就像看见多少年未见的亲人”。会后很多代表向所属群众作了传达，“不加紧抗美援朝就对不住志愿军将士”，成了推动各种工作的一个重要动力。
    经过这次会议，在抗美援朝运动已经开展的地方，正在进一步把运动深入到实际工作和生活中去，过去没有卷入运动的人，也开始积极参加。会议的结果，证明了采取这样的组织形式来推动和扩大抗美援朝运动是很有效的。
    三月四日，全市各界妇女举行了抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的五万余人示威大游行。这是天津空前的妇女大集会。许多一向不出门的老太太也兴奋地参加了游行行列，和年青的闺女们一齐喊口号。会上，全市各界妇女通过了共同的爱国公约。会后，全市各工厂、各学校、各机关、各街道妇女又纷纷订立了自己的爱国公约。大家都提出要以加强抗美援朝的实际行动来纪念“三八”节，“把抗美援朝运动贯彻到实际生活中去”。
    全市的职工在普遍控诉美国武装日本罪行后，纷纷以加强爱国竞赛、向马恒昌小组应战等实际行动来表示爱国决心，各厂职工并分别提出生产保证和小组爱国公约。就是一般过去不易开展竞赛的私营企业特别是其中的中小工厂，经过抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的宣传教育，资方的顾虑打消了，职工的觉悟和生产积极性更提高了，也都陆续展开了竞赛。全市二十个产业工会，其中九个已有七百八十五个小组向马恒昌小组应战。最近结合实行劳保条例，各工厂企业又展开了一次广泛的爱国主义宣传，并且准备将宣传教育的影响逐渐深入到每一厂、每一人和每一个家属去。
    三月十一日，人民解放军驻津某部与津市学生共三万多人举行了反对美国重新武装日本示威大会。战士和学生在会前分别组成了九个大队进行活动。为了使经常性的爱国主义教育更加深入，现在各校正准备进一步加强政治课内容。
    工商联合会三月九日召集一百二十二个行业公会的主任委员，传达了全市抗美援朝代表会议的决议，随即成立了反对美帝武装日本、控诉日寇暴行委员会。二月中旬以后，天津工商界即曾普遍控诉过去日寇占领时所受到的种种摧残与迫害，以及美帝国主义随蒋匪俱来后所遭遇的剥削和压制。现在正由工商联合会统一领导和主持，进行以行业为单位的控诉，然后将再集中举行一次几千人的全市代表大会进行大规模的控诉。与控诉相结合，天津工商界正在对过去提出的四项保证再加以充实，举行“决心会”，保证加以贯彻。
    天津文艺界在三月十一日举行了全市性的誓师大会，到会的文学、音乐、美术、戏剧工作者共二千多人。他们一致通过了爱国公约，保证要运用各种文艺形式，培养人民爱国主义与国际主义精神，加强批评自我批评，加强团结，努力创造新的人民文艺。过去饱受日、美、蒋匪帮欺凌的曲艺界一千余人，在听了代表会议的传达和控诉日寇暴行后，也全体通过爱国公约。他们保证积极进行爱国主义宣传活动，不演唱违反人民利益的戏剧与曲艺。
    宗教界的爱国革新运动三月份也有了新的开展。基督教代表霍培修在全市抗美援朝代表会上提出，宗教界要以加强自立革新运动来反对美国武装日本，这是个总的目标。要自立，首先必须斩断与帝国主义的联系，而这就不可避免地引起异常激烈的斗争。天津天主教自立革新运动中的斗争，特别紧张，现在已经有了重大的发展。全市中国神父都已在自立革新运动的宣言上签名。许多教徒、神父及教会学校学生教员纷纷展开控诉运动，揭露帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的罪恶。过去一部分对抗美援朝不甚积极的天主教徒学生，现在也逐渐认识到帝国主义的狞狰面目而觉悟起来了，并与帝国主义分子外国主教外国神父进行了正面的斗争。这个经验，值得全国学习。全市佛教徒三百多人也签订了爱国公约。七区小红桥派出所管界内的道士，也提出以实际行动参加抗美援朝。
    中医界在参加全市医药界示威大游行后，三月十二日又召开了六百余人的大会，订立了五项爱国公约。
    此外，全市各区也分别在三月内先后召开的各界代表会议上传达了抗美援朝代表会的决议，并订立或补充了全区性的爱国公约。在会后，又通过抗美援朝代表会议的代表和区代表、居民代表等，在区内很多地方都召开了行业或地区的群众会或代表会，传达各界代表会决议，同时研究自己应该怎样来实现公约的办法。对于无组织群众和街道市民，这种通过会议逐级进行教育的方式，也证明很有效。
    在抗美援朝总会号召之下，目前全市各阶层、各行业、有组织和无组织的群众都正在进一步地动员起来。为使每一处、每一个人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，更加普及发展全市的运动，为了迎接“五一”大示威，天津市抗美援朝会已订立了一个新的计划，决定在三月底进行准备，四月内全面展开，以迎接全市抗美援朝新高潮的到来。
