To the Editorial Staff regarding "Opposing Incorrect Literary Criticism":

　　We have read the article "Opposing Incorrect Literary Criticism" in your journal, issue 86, and we strongly agree with your editor's note. Naturalism and formalism tendencies in literary criticism should indeed be opposed.

　　However, when a reader quoted several passages from the Russian Communist Party Central Committee's resolution on literary policy, such as, "Marxist criticism should expel from its midst arrogant, half-baked, and sanctimonious Communist Party airs," "The Party should eradicate by all means attempts at arbitrary and incompetent administrative interference in literary affairs," and then said, "How familiar these guidelines are to us today! We also need the same guidelines." These words easily give people the illusion that such "arrogant, half-baked, and sanctimonious Communist Party airs" already exist in current literary criticism, and that the Party has already made "attempts at arbitrary and incompetent administrative interference in literary affairs." Therefore, the reader exclaimed, "How familiar these guidelines are to us today! We also need the same guidelines." This statement, in our opinion, is one-sided and does not conform to the facts. We wonder from where the reader obtained the factual basis for raising this urgent request.

　　Secondly, because Mr. Lao She mentioned "admonitions from friends," the reader sensitively suspected, "Are there among Mr. Lao She's friends some who display the Communist Party airs mentioned here?" They also said: the shortcomings of this play were "caused by incorrect literary criticism," and finally demanded, "Speaking solely in terms of responsibility...the critics who enthusiastically advised Mr. Lao She to change his creative plans...should also answer his questions." We also disagree with these opinions. We have read "Discussing Fang Zhenzhu's Play" several times. Mr. Lao She said, "Friends advised me not to write it that way," "I accepted this advice," "I do not blame my friends for being meddlesome. Their suggestions were well-intentioned." From these words, we are surprised that the reader would sensitively generate the above suspicions. Moreover, advice is different from orders. If the advice is incorrect, the author can refuse to adopt it. Having been adopted, it indicates that the author also agrees with the opinion. Even if it is later proven that the opinion was actually wrong, the responsibility cannot be borne by the advisor, nor is there any need to pursue responsibility or demand a response, let alone rashly question whether the advisor is "displaying Communist Party airs." These demands, on the surface, seem like sharp criticisms, but in reality, they will block avenues of expression and hinder mass exploration and research into creation, because no one can guarantee that their opinions are 100% correct.

　　In the movement to develop literary criticism and self-criticism, it is inevitable that some opinions will be inadequate or even completely wrong. To correct these shortcomings, on the one hand, critics can be asked to consider carefully and make specific demands based on the specific circumstances of the writers, but more importantly, readers, writers, and critics should all be mobilized to participate in the discussion. If a work is not good, readers and critics can offer opinions. If the criticism is incorrect, readers and writers can also criticize the criticism. To thoroughly understand the issues, everyone should participate in the debate and seek correct conclusions from the debate. Otherwise, any accusations, questions, or labeling of literary criticism will hinder the development of literary criticism and also hinder the improvement of creation.

　　I am not engaged in literary criticism, and the above opinions may not be correct. I hope you will provide guidance.

Editor's Note: Issue 86 of this journal published a letter from a reader, "Opposing Incorrect Literary Criticism," written after reading Mr. Lao She's "Discussing Fang Zhenzhu's Play" in the "Literary Gazette." The reader regretted that Mr. Lao She, in the process of creation, accepted incorrect criticism, which damaged the integrity of the play and thus affected the political and artistic effect of the work. We believe that the reader's opinion of opposing this incorrect literary criticism is correct. Naturalistic tendencies and formulaic tendencies proceeding from concepts, which exist in literary criticism, are harmful to creation. The particular danger of this incorrect criticism lies in the fact that it often invokes "political" reasons that make it difficult for the author to resist. Therefore, Party literary critics, especially leading cadres in literary work, must adopt an extra cautious and responsible attitude when specifically helping writers create or criticizing works, and must not adopt a rash and reckless attitude. The reader's main point was directed at the Party's literary leading cadres, so quoting some words from the Russian Communist Party Central Committee's resolution on literary policy is meaningful. Some readers have written to express the opinion that many of the reader's words derived from the resolution give the feeling that there are already serious phenomena of "Communist Party airs" and "arbitrary administrative interference" in the current literary circle, and the reader's letter does not cite factual basis. We believe that this phenomenon exists in some places, or at least it is worth being vigilant about.

　　We are now publishing the letter from readers Chen Wenliang and Xiao Tang, along with Mr. Lao She's supplementary opinion on this issue, namely the article "Learning Comes First," in this issue. From the letters of Chen and Xiao and other comrades, it can be seen how urgently the broad masses of readers need literary criticism, how enthusiastically they cherish literary criticism, and also provide useful opinions on the methods of criticism.

　　Mr. Lao She's proposal of the slogan "Learning Comes First" is very good. "Learning" is indeed the main key to solving all problems, not only for authors but also for critics. His opinions, such as demanding that critics not "blame the author for extra-textual thoughts and effects," are also worthy of attention.

### 关于《反对不正确的文艺批评》
陈文良　肖堂

专栏：读者来信

　　关于《反对不正确的文艺批评》编辑同志：
    读贵刊八十六期的《反对不正确的文艺批评》一文，我们很同意你的按语，文艺批评中的自然主义及公式主义等倾向，确实应该反对。
    但是一读者在摘引了俄共中央关于文艺政策的决议中的几段文字，如：“马克思主义批评应当从自己中间驱除狂妄的、半通的和神气十足的共产党员架子”，“党应当用一切办法根除对文学事业的专横的和不胜任的行政干涉的尝试”等等之后，接着说：“这些方针，对于我们今天是多么亲切啊！我们也需要同样的方针。”这些话很容易给人一种错觉，好像目前的文艺批评中已经存在着这种“狂妄的，半通的和神气十足的共产党员架子”，好像党已经有了“对文学事业的专横的和不能胜任的行政干涉的尝试”所以一读者才大叫“这些方针，对于我们今天是多么亲切啊！我们也需要同样的方针”。这种说法，我以为是片面的而且不符合事实的，不知道一读者从什么地方得到他提出这迫切要求的事实根据？
    其次，一读者因为老舍先生“友人们嘱告”这一句话，便敏感地怀疑“老舍先生的友人们中间是不是也有这里所提的摆共产党员架子的人们？”又说：这个剧本的缺点是“不正确的文艺批评造成的”，最后并要求“单从责任上说……曾经热心地劝告老舍先生改变创作计划……的批评家们，也就应当来答复他的问题”。我们也不同意这些意见，“谈方珍珠剧本”我们看过几遍了，老舍先生说：“友人们嘱告我不要那样写”，“我接受了这个劝说”，“我并不怪友人们多嘴。他们的建议是善意的”，从这些话里面，我们奇怪一读者怎么会敏感地产生上面那些怀疑？而且，劝告与命令不同，如果劝告不正确，作者可以拒绝采纳。既经采纳，就表示作者也同意这个意见，即使事后证明这意见实际上是错误的，责任也不能要劝告者负担，也没有追究责任，要求答复的必要，更不能轻率质问劝说者是不是“摆共产党员架子的人们”。这些要求，表面看似乎很像尖锐的指摘，实际上都会起着闭塞言路，阻止群众性的对创作进行探讨研究的作用，因为谁也不敢保证他的意见一定十二分的正确。
    在开展文艺的批评与自我批评的运动当中，不可避免地会有一些意见不够惬当，甚至是完全错误。要纠正这些缺点，一方面固然可以要求批评家慎重考虑，根据作家的具体情况提出具体要求，但更重要的还是发动读者、作家、批评家都来参加讨论。作品不好，读者与批评家可以提出意见。批评不对，读者与作家也可以对批评提出批评。为了彻底弄通问题，大家参加论争，从论争中求得正确结论，这才是根本办法，此外任何对文艺批评的指责，质问，戴大帽子等现象，都会妨碍文艺批评的开展，同时也妨碍创作的提高。
    我不是搞文艺批评的，上面意见不一定正确，希望你们指示。
                                  陈文良、肖堂
    编者按：本刊第八十六期发表了一读者从《文艺报》上读到老舍先生《谈方珍珠剧本》一文后所写的《反对不正确的文艺批评》的一封信。一读者惋惜老舍先生在创作过程中，由于接受了一种不正确的批评，以致损害了剧本的完整性，因而也影响了作品的政治的与艺术的效果。我们认为一读者反对这种不正确的文艺批评的意见是对的。存在于文艺批评中的自然主义倾向，和从概念出发的公式主义倾向，对创作是有害的。这种不正确批评的特别危险性，是在它往往借口于使作者难以拒抗的“政治”的理由。因此党的文艺批评者，特别是文艺工作的领导干部，在具体帮助作家创作或对作品进行批评的时候，必须采取格外谨慎的负责的态度，而不能采取轻率的鲁莽的态度。一读者的主要意思是对党的文艺领导干部说的，因此引用俄共中央关于文艺政策决议中的一些话，是有意义的。有些读者来信提出意见，认为一读者由决议引伸出来的许多话给人一种感觉，好像目前文艺界已存在着摆“共产党员架子”及“专横的行政干涉”的严重现象，而一读者的信中又没有举出事实根据来。我们认为，这种现象在某些地方是存在的，至少是值得加以警惕的。
    现在把读者陈文良、肖堂两同志的信和老舍先生对这一问题的补充意见即《学习当先》一文一起在本期发表出来。从陈、肖两同志及其他同志同样的来信中，可以看出广大的读者如何迫切需要文艺批评，又如何热烈爱护文艺批评，并且在批评的方法上也提供了有益的意见。
    老舍先生提出了“学习当先”的口号，是很好的。“学习”，的确是解决一切问题的主要关键，不但对于作者，对于批评者也是如此。他要求批评者不要“用题外的思想与效果来责难作者”等等的意见也是值得重视的。
