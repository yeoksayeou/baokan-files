　　The China Relief Goods General Association today issued a statement, expressing its firm support for the measure taken by the China Committee for Relief to Malayan Displaced Compatriots to organize an investigation team to go to Malaya to investigate the situation of displaced compatriots. The full text of the statement is as follows:
　　The British colonial authorities in Malaya, disregarding the repeated solemn statements and protests of our entire people and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, are hostile to the Chinese people and persecute our Malayan compatriots. Since the British colonial authorities in Malaya announced its first so-called "Emergency Ordinance" on June 18, 1948, and issued the so-called "New Emergency Regulations" and "Malayan New Emergency Law" on January 10, 1949, and April 29, 1950, respectively, the inhuman persecution, abuse, and expulsion suffered by our Malayan compatriots have been countless. According to the accusations of several groups of compatriots who were deported back to the country, the British colonial authorities even used barbaric arrests, beatings, rapes, "collective punishment," the forced relocation of tens of thousands, and imprisonment in concentration camps, as well as various inhuman tortures once used by the Japanese fascist bandits during their rule of Malaya. All these barbarous atrocities of British imperialism show how hostile it is to the Chinese people.
　　Our entire people have reached the limit of their tolerance for the above-mentioned persecution inflicted on our compatriots by the British colonial authorities in Malaya, and we must not ignore it. Therefore, the Committee for Relief to Malayan Displaced Compatriots was organized to express solidarity and decided to send an investigation team to Malaya to investigate the situation of displaced compatriots. This decision to express solidarity and send an investigation team is completely just and necessary. We firmly support this decision and will support this timely action with practical work. Malayan compatriots who are suffering, the people of the motherland are your backing, and the brutal imperialist colonialists will surely receive the punishment they deserve.

　　中国人民救济总会发表声明
    坚决拥护派遣调查团调查马来亚难侨情况
    【新华社十日讯】中国人民救济总会今日发表声明，对中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会组织调查团赴马来亚调查难侨情况的措施，表示坚决拥护。声明全文如下：
    马来亚英国殖民地当局，不顾我全国人民和中央人民政府外交部一再的严正声明和抗议，与中国人民为敌，迫害我马来亚侨胞。自马来亚英国殖民地当局一九四八年六月十八日宣布其第一个所谓“紧急法令”、一九四九年一月十日及一九五○年四月二十九日分别发布所谓“新紧急条例”、“马来亚新紧急法”等一连串反动法令以来，我马来亚侨胞所受非人迫害、虐待和驱逐，已罄竹难书。据被逐返国的几批侨胞的控诉，英殖民地当局竟使用了野蛮逮捕、毒打、强奸、“集体惩罚”、成千累万的被迫迁移以及关入集中营等毒辣手段，及日本法西斯强盗统治马来亚时期所曾使用过的种种惨无人道的酷刑。英帝国主义的这一切野蛮暴行，说明着它是如何的敌视着中国人民。
    对马来亚英国殖民地当局加于我侨胞身上的上述种种迫害，我全国人民已忍无可忍，决不能置之不顾，因此组织了马来亚难侨委员会予以声援，并决定派遣调查团前往马来亚调查难侨情况。这种声援和派遣调查团的决定是完全正义和必须的。我们坚决拥护这一决定，并将以实际工作支持这一适时的行动。马来亚受难的侨胞们，祖国的人民是你们的后盾，残暴的帝国主义殖民者是一定会得到他们应得的惩罚的。
  中国人民救济总会  一九五一年三月十日
