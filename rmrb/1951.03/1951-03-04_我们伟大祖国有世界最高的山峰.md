Editor's Note: The main peak of the Himalayas, towering on the southwestern border of our country, was formerly called "Mount Everest," which is an incorrect name. It should be called "Mount Qomolangma." In the picture caption of "Our Great Motherland" in our newspaper on January 9th, the name "Everest" was mistakenly used and should be corrected. In the 66th issue of the "Kaiming Juvenile" magazine published on February 16th of this year, Mr. Ju Hou's article "Big and Small, High and Low" was published, which includes a paragraph explaining this issue. It is now excerpted and reprinted here for everyone's attention.

"Our motherland has the world's highest peak." When you hear this sentence, you will definitely think that I am talking about Mount Everest in the Himalayas. But the title of this section mentions Mount Qomolangma. Why is this?

It turns out there is a story here, a story of imperialist aggression against us in academics and culture.

You may not know the origin of the name "Everest," as ordinary geography textbooks rarely mention this issue. Let me briefly tell you.

"Everest" is translated from the English word Everest. This was the name of a British man who served as the Director of the Indian Survey in the mid-19th century. In 1852, he secretly measured the Himalayas and discovered this highest peak in the world, and put his own name on it. Since then, the name "Mount Everest" has been adopted by Europeans and Americans. Since then, people have generally recognized that this highest peak in the world was discovered by the British Everest. Our Chinese scholars seem to be too polite, and they have tacitly accepted this name, as if this highest peak in the world was really first discovered by Everest. The names "Mount Everest" have also appeared in our geography textbooks and maps.

In fact, this mountain peak was discovered by the Chinese themselves. As early as 1717, 135 years before Everest discovered this peak, when the Qing Dynasty emperor sent many people to survey and map the entire country, it had already been discovered. Later, when the map was drawn, the name "Qomolangma" had already been filled in at the location of the current "Mount Everest". This name was given to it by the local Tibetan people. The meaning is "Holy Mother Water". It's just that these maps were locked in the deep palace after they were drawn, and no one outside knew about them. Therefore, Everest was able to seize the honor of discovering the world's highest peak.

We have an old saying, "The name follows the owner." Therefore, we should correct the name of this world's highest peak. We should abolish the name "Mount Everest" and replace it with "Mount Qomolangma" or "Holy Mother Water Peak"!

The height of this world's highest peak is 8,882 meters above sea level.

### 我们伟大祖国有世界最高的山峰

　　我们伟大祖国有世界最高的山峰
    编者按：耸立在我国西南边疆上的喜马拉雅山的主峰，过去曾被称为“额非尔士峰”，这是错误的名称。它应该叫做“珠穆朗玛峰”。本报一月九日《我们伟大的祖国》的图片说明中错误地沿用了“额非尔士”的名称，应予更正。本年二月十六日出版的《开明少年》杂志第六十六期上，发表了鞠候先生的《大小高低》一文，其中有一段是说明这个问题的，现摘录转载在这里，请大家注意。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    “祖国有世界最高的高峰”。你们听到了这句话，一定会想起，我要说到喜马拉雅山中的额非尔士或者埃佛勒斯峰了。但是这一节的题目上却说起了珠穆朗玛峰。这是为了什么呢？
    原来这里面有一个故事，一个帝国主义者在学术文化上侵略我们的故事。
    你可能不知道“额非尔士”或者“埃佛勒斯”这个名字的来源，普通地理教科书里是不大谈到这个问题的。现在让我来简单地告诉你。
    “额非尔士”或者“埃佛勒斯”都是从英文Everest翻译过来的。这原是一个英国人的名字，他在十九世纪中叶担任印度测量局的局长。一八五二年，他偷偷地测量了喜马拉雅山，发现了这一座世界上最高的高峰，就把自己的名字放上去了。从此，“额非尔士峰”或是“埃佛勒斯峰”这个名字就被欧美人所采用了。从此，人们公认这一座世界的最高峰是英国人额非尔士所发现了。我们中国的学者们似乎太客气了，也就默认了这个名字，好像这世界最高峰真是额非尔士首先发现的。我们的地理教科书、地图上也就出现了“额非尔士峰”或者“埃佛勒斯峰”的名字。
    其实，这座山峰是我们中国人自己发现的。早在一七一七年，也就是额非尔士发现这山峰之前一百三十五年，清朝皇帝派出许多人去测绘全国地图的时候就已经发现了。后来绘成了地图，在现今“额非尔士峰”所在的地方，已经填上了“珠穆朗玛”的名字。这个名字是当地藏族人民给它取的。意义是“圣母之水”。只是这些地图绘成以后就被锁在深宫里，外间无从知道。因此让额非尔士抢去了发现世界第一高峰的荣誉。
    我们有句老话，叫作“名从主人”。所以我们应该把这一个世界第一高峰的名字纠正过来。我们应该取消“额非尔士峰”或者“埃佛勒斯峰”的名字，把它换上了“珠穆朗玛”，或者“圣母之水峰”！
    这一座世界第一高峰的高度是海拔八千八百八十二公尺。
