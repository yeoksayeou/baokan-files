To the Editor:

	West of Zhengjia Village, Xinbin County, Liaoning Province, on the grassland, there is a large grave containing the remains of twenty-eight kind Chinese farmers who were massacred by the Japanese invaders. The people of the surrounding villages, in order to ensure that their children and grandchildren will never forget the hatred of the Japanese bandits who slaughtered the Chinese people, have named it the "Mound of Flesh" grave.

	In May 1943, the Japanese "punitive force" went to Xinbin County to conduct "punitive expeditions," but were ambushed by the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in the mountains. As the Japanese returned in defeat, they saw some wild opium poppies by the roadside and wanted to make trouble for the Chinese people. Later, they encountered Zhao Mazi, a farmer hoeing in the field, and the Japanese went up and asked: "Where is your home? Where are the opium poppies planted?" Without waiting for Zhao Mazi to explain, the Japanese tied him up. Then they surrounded Xiaoxigou Village and searched every house. All twenty-eight men over the age of ten in the village were taken away. Zhao Mazi was publicly stuffed into a sack and beaten to death. After they were taken to Zhengjia Village, the Japanese forced people to dig a large pit outside the village and made the twenty-eight bound men kneel around the pit. The Japanese then drew their knives and slashed wildly as if they were insane. Some were still crying and cursing when they were pushed into the pit. The next morning, someone passed by the pit and saw that the soil on top of the pit was still moving. Because Japanese troops and puppet police were stationed in the village, no one dared to move. Twenty-eight kind Chinese people were buried in the pit just like that. Later, the local people called this killing field the "Mound of Flesh" grave. To forever remember this hatred, people sang a folk song: "Japanese devils, demonic monsters, killing people indiscriminately for no reason. Tongjia Village burned to the ground, twenty-eight people killed in Xiaoxigou. Leaving behind elderly mothers and wives and children, crying and longing for the 'Mound of Flesh' grave every day. When will these suffering days end? Who can escape the 'Mound of Flesh' grave? The Chinese people must unite and quickly join the Anti-Japanese Army."

	The Japanese invaders buried countless such "Mound of Flesh" graves throughout China. Today, American imperialism wants to arm Japan again and come to kill the Chinese people again. The Chinese people must never allow American imperialism to do this.

### 决不许美帝武装日本再来制造“肉丘坟”

    决不许美帝武装日本再来制造“肉丘坟”编辑同志：
    辽东省新宾县郑家村西边的草地上，有一个很大的坟墓，里面埋着被日寇所屠杀的二十八个善良的中国农民。周围各村的老百姓，为了使自己的儿孙后代永远不会忘记日本强盗屠杀中国人的仇恨，把它起名叫“肉丘坟”。
    一九四三年五月间，日寇的“讨伐队”到新宾县去“讨伐”，结果在山里又被抗日联军打了个埋伏战。日寇在败兴回走的时候，在路旁看见了几棵野生的大烟，就想在中国老百姓头上找是非。后来，碰上在地里锄地的农民赵麻子，鬼子就上去问：“你的家那边？种大烟的那边？”没等赵麻子分说，鬼子就把他绑上。接着就把小西沟村子包围起来，挨家搜查。全村十岁以上的二十八个男子都被绑走。并当众把赵麻子装在麻袋里，活活摔死。他们被带到郑家村后，鬼子就抓人在村外挖了一个大土坑，让被绑的二十八个人跪在坑周围。鬼子就抽出刀来，象发疯一样，胡乱砍杀。有的还在哭喊叫骂着，就被推进坑去。第二天早上，有人从坑旁路过，只见坑上面的土还在动弹。因为村里驻着日寇和伪警察，谁也不敢去动。二十八个善良的中国人民，就这样被埋进土坑里。以后，当地老百姓就把这杀人场叫作“肉丘坟”。人们为永记这一仇恨，曾唱出一只歌谣：“日本小鬼丧魔神，无缘无故乱杀人。佟家村一把火烧个净，小西沟杀死二十八个人。家留老母和妻儿，天天哭望‘肉丘坟’。受罪的日子何时了，谁能躲过肉丘坟？中国人民团结起，赶快参加抗日军。”
    日寇在中国各地不知埋下了多少这样的“肉丘坟”。今天，美国帝国主义又想武装日本再起，再来杀害中国人民，中国人民决不能允许美国帝国主义这样作。
