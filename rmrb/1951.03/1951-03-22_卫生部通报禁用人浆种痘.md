Xinhua News Agency, March 20th – The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has issued a notice to local health administrative organs to strictly prohibit the use of human lymph for inoculation.

The Ministry received a report from the Health Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee stating that Shen Junyi, a resident of Jiazizhu Garden, Huangjin District, Gong'an County, Hubei Province, indiscriminately used human lymph to inoculate others, causing a smallpox epidemic and the death of six children. A similar incident also occurred in the Fifth District of Qingjiang County, Jiangxi Province.

The Ministry pointed out in the notice that the use of human lymph for inoculation not only cannot prevent smallpox but will instead expand the spread of smallpox. This method should be resolutely stopped. In carrying out inoculation work in various regions, in-depth publicity should be conducted to correct the unscientific views of some people. Special attention should be paid to uniting, persuading, and educating local "inoculation practitioners" to improve their skills.

　　卫生部通报禁用人浆种痘
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府卫生部通报各地卫生行政机关，切实查禁使用人浆种痘。
    该部接到中南军政委员会卫生部报告：湖北省公安县黄金区夹竹园居民沈俊义在当地滥用人浆为他人种痘，引起天花流行，死亡小儿六人。江西省清江县第五区也有同样事件发生。
    该部在通报中指出：使用人浆种痘，不但不能预防天花，反而会扩大天花的传染。此种办法应切实制止。各地在开展种痘工作中，应深入宣传，纠正部分群众不科学的看法；对于当地“种痘先生”尤应注意团结、说服与教育，以提高他们的技术。
