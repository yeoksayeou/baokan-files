　　Suiyuan Animal By-Products Open Up Sales Channels, Farmers and Herdsmen's Purchasing Power Gradually Increases

    Suiyuan Province achieved success in promoting the sale of hides, furs, and local products last year. According to statistics from six fur and pelt distribution markets, including Gui Sui, Baotou, Jining, Zhuozi Mountain, and Fengzhen, the total annual output of wool and down was over 23.27 million catties, and various animal hides totaled 600,000 pieces, accounting for about 90 percent of the province's total output, with a total value of over 130 billion yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the total output value of local products in the province. After farmers and herdsmen's hides and furs found sales channels, their purchasing power gradually increased. In agricultural areas, many farmers have changed into new clothes and spread new mats on their kangs (traditional brick beds); Mongolian people in pastoral areas are also buying more boots, brick tea, and fried rice than in previous years, and merchants traveling to Mongolia in various places feel that goods are in short supply and cannot meet the needs of customers.

    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the output of wool and down in Suiyuan Province accounted for more than half of the country's exports and was extremely popular in international and domestic markets. In terms of leather goods, there was also the saying "Suzhou and Hangzhou silk, West Exit leather jackets." Later, due to the various destructions of animal husbandry by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, coupled with traffic blockages and stagnant exports, the output sharply decreased. According to statistics from Gui Sui and Baotou, the amount of wool and down on the market in 1948 decreased by 80 percent compared with 1933. The destruction of the tanned leather industry was even worse. Taking Gui Sui City as an example, there were more than 40 tanned leather shops before the war, exporting no less than 400,000 pieces of goat, badger, fox, and other hides every year; by 1946, there were only two tanned leather shops left, and the export volume was less than 5,000 pieces.

    After the liberation of the province, the state-owned fur and pelt company purchased large quantities of hides and furs and appropriately increased the prices of hides and furs. For example, in the past, 100 catties of sheep's wool could only be exchanged for one bolt of white cloth, but in 1950, it could be exchanged for four bolts. At the same time, the state-owned fur and pelt company cooperated with cooperative organizations at all levels to organize supply and marketing teams to directly bring industrial products to the countryside for exchange purchases; branches of the People's Bank in various places also handled export exchange and purchase loans in producing areas on a large scale; the industry and commerce bureaus of various counties and cities also vigorously organized joint operations by private merchants to go deep into producing areas for purchases or consignment purchases. This stimulated the large-scale export of hides and furs in the province and the smooth exchange of urban and rural materials, and the market tended to be active. The number of private fur and pelt shops in Gui Sui and Baotou alone has increased from 46 in 1949 to 88 last year, and the number of tanned leather shops also increased by more than 30 last year. At the same time, there are also many merchants stationed in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places for long-term purchases. (Han Feng)

　　绥远皮毛土产打开销路
    农牧民购买力逐渐提高
    绥远省在去年推销皮、毛土产上获得成绩。据归绥、包头、集宁、卓资山、丰镇等六个皮毛集散市场统计，全年共输出绒毛两千三百二十七万余斤，各种兽皮六十万张，占该省总产量的百分之九十左右，总值一千三百余亿元，占全省土产输出总值的百分之六十。农民、牧民的皮毛获得销路后，购买力逐渐提高。在农业区不少农民都换了新衣，炕上铺了新席；牧区的蒙民购买靴子、砖茶、炒米的亦较往年为多，各地旅蒙客商均感货缺不能满足顾主的要求。
    绥远省所产的毛、绒，抗战前产量占全国出口的半数以上，极受国际国内市场欢迎。在皮货上也有“苏杭绸缎、西口皮袄”的称号。其后由于日寇、蒋匪对畜牧业的种种破坏，加之交通阻塞，出口停滞，致产量锐减。据归绥、包头两市统计，一九四八年上市，绒毛量与一九三三年相比减少百分之八十。熟皮业破坏更甚，以归绥市为例，战前有熟皮店四十余家，每年出口只羊、獾、狐等皮不下四十万张；到一九四六年熟皮店仅剩两家，出口量不到五千张。
    该省解放后，国营皮毛公司即大量收购皮毛，并适当地提高皮毛价格，如羊毛过去每百斤只能换一匹白市布，一九五○年已能换到四匹，同时国营皮毛公司配合各级合作社组织供销小组直接带工业品下乡换购；人民银行各地支行亦大量办理出口押汇与产区采购贷款；各县、市工商局亦大力组织私商联营，深入产区收购或代购。这样就刺激了该省皮毛的大量出口和城乡物资的畅旺交流，市场趋向活跃。仅归绥、包头两市私营皮毛店已由一九四九年的四十六家上升至去年的八十八家，熟皮店在去年亦增加三十多家，同时北京、天津、上海等地长年驻购的商人也很多。（寒风）
