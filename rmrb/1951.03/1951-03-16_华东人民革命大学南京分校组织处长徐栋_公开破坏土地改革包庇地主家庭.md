Party Life

Xu Dong, Head of the Organization Department of the East China People's Revolutionary University Nanjing Branch,
    Openly Sabotages Land Reform and Shelters Landlord Families

Xu Dong, Head of the Organization Department of the East China People's Revolutionary University Nanjing Branch, joined the Party in 1938. During the land reform movement, he attacked the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, sheltered his own landlord family, and openly sabotaged land reform. Xu Dong's father, Xu Juchu, was a landlord who was capable of everything—gambling, whoring, eating, and dressing—before the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Xu Juchu became a bandit. In 1938, Xu Juchu organized a puppet self-defense force and killed Wang Asan and his mother, innocent poor peasants in Nanfangquan. Later, he refused the New Fourth Army's advice to reorganize and joined the "Loyal National Salvation Army" under the command of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Zhang Xiaoguang, serving as Zhang's advisor and director of the office, commanding an assassination team that specialized in counter-revolutionary activities, and murdered Dong Hongji and Gu Yunchu, two cadres of the Taihu Tax Office. In addition, Xu Juchu often led his bandit troops to rob passengers and cargo ships on Taihu Lake, injuring nine people. For example, after robbing a cargo ship of the Xihu Transportation Company, he sank the ship and its passengers into the lake. He also colluded with the Guangdong gang to manufacture poison pills and provided armed protection for trafficking. In 1942, Xu Juchu became a Japanese spy and served as the puppet mayor of Nanfangquan. At this time, Xu Juchu relied even more on the enemy's power to kidnap and extort, seize land and occupy houses, doing everything evil. In 1944, Xu Juchu went to the anti-Japanese base area in northern Jiangsu and met with Xu Dong. After Xu Juchu returned home, he became a double-dealer. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Kuomintang reactionary government sentenced Xu Juchu to ten years in prison for treason, but released him in 1948 and appointed him as the deputy head of the local puppet self-defense corps. Xu Juchu continued to act recklessly and harm the people. After Wuxi County was liberated, when rent reduction was carried out, Xu Juchu violated the law and said to the tenants, "Those who farm my land are unlucky, I cannot reduce rent." After the land reform began, his activities became even more intense. Xu Juchu instructed his confidant lackey Xu Rongpei to steal the position of director of the village peasant association in order to prevent the peasants from evaluating him as a landlord. Xu Juchu also gathered landlords such as Xu Jianhe to conspire to deny their status and evade land reform. At the same time, he instructed Xu Rongpei's wife to deliberately make noise at the class designation meeting in order to disrupt the class designation work. Xu Juchu also threatened the masses, saying, "Don't be smug, be careful of eating hemp seeds in the future." The broad masses could no longer tolerate Xu Juchu's oppression and exploitation and reported him to the People's Government. Therefore, the Wuxi County People's Government accepted the people's opinions and arrested Xu Juchu. The Wuxi County People's Government sent a copy of all the materials on Xu Juchu's crimes against the people to Xu Dong, first seeking Xu Dong's opinion on how to handle this issue. (Editor's note: It is wrong to seek Xu Dong's opinion first.)

    Before the land reform in the county, Xu Dong had brought his landlord father to work at the East China People's Revolutionary University Nanjing Branch in order to escape mass struggle, but he was streamlined back to his hometown because his father could not work. Xu Dong wrote a letter to the local township and village cadres saying that his father was "returning home on a temporary assignment." When Xu Dong learned that his father had been arrested, instead of supporting the peasants' just actions and the government's correct handling, he went home privately on November 17, 1950, to the Wuxi County Party Committee to defend his father. He said that the materials of the Wuxi County People's Government were not true, that his father had not committed any crimes, that he was a good man, and that the government should not arrest him; and he requested that a mass meeting be held to discuss this matter. At this time, Xu Dong took his father out of the prison and talked to him in the reception room of the Wuxi County Party Committee. (Editor's note: By what authority did Xu Dong arbitrarily extract a prisoner from the government's prison, especially to talk to him in the reception room of the Wuxi County Party Committee? The Wuxi County People's Government and the Wuxi County Party Committee should also be held responsible for this matter.) On the 19th, the County People's Government held a mass meeting in Nitouqiao to mobilize the masses to give their opinions on Xu Juchu. Cadres who had been persecuted by Xu Juchu were the first to come forward to accuse him of his crimes. At this time, Xu Juchu's three lackeys came out to defend Xu, and with Xu Dong present, the masses did not dare to raise any more opinions.

    On December 3, Xu Dong sent his mother and wife to the Wuxi County People's Government to appeal, and requested the Wuxi County Party Committee to write a letter approving the removal of the furniture from his home, but the County Party Committee did not agree. At this time, Xu Dong accepted a handgun given to him by the landlord Zhang, an old woman. When he left, he took Zhang with him, helping her to evade land reform.

    After returning to Nanjing, Xu Dong maintained contact with his father's confidant lackeys, regularly listening to their reports and directing them to carry out illegal activities. At the same time, he constantly wrote letters to the Wuxi County Party Committee, making unreasonable accusations. Soon, Xu Dong used the school's typewriter to type an eighteen-page report that slandered the People's Government, slandered the masses, and resolutely sheltered his landlord family, and distributed this report to relevant cadres and the masses, undermining the leadership prestige of the Wuxi County Party Committee and the Wuxi County People's Government, in order to achieve his goal of sheltering his landlord family. The report mainly stated that the Wuxi County People's Government had made mistakes in implementing policies and distorted the land reform decrees of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the East China Military and Political Committee, and repeatedly stated, "I still retain military status, and my younger siblings have also joined the army, so my family should be regarded as a revolutionary military family; moreover, the composition of my family is basically poor middle peasant." Xu Dong also unreasonably demanded that the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China establish a "temporary three-person group" (one person from the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office, one person from the Wuxi County Party Committee, and Xu Dong) to handle the Xu Juchu issue.

    In order to uphold Party discipline and maintain the purity of our Party, and with the approval of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China announced on February 17 that Xu Dong would be expelled from the Party; and entrusted the Wuxi County Party Committee to announce this decision to the local people. The school also dismissed him from his post and transferred him to the court for punishment according to law.

　　华东人民革命大学南京分校组织处长徐栋
    公开破坏土地改革包庇地主家庭
    华东人民革命大学南京分校组织处长徐栋，一九三八年入党，在土地改革运动中，打击党与人民政府威信，包庇自己的地主家庭公开破坏土地改革。徐栋的父亲徐菊初，在抗日战争前，就是一个嫖赌吃穿全能的地主。抗日战争爆发后，徐菊初就当了土匪。一九三八年徐菊初又组织伪自卫队，杀死南方泉无辜贫农王阿三母子。以后又拒绝新四军劝他改编的忠告，投到蒋匪特务“忠义救国军”章晓光部下，当章的参谋兼办事处主任，指挥暗杀队，专门进行反革命活动，曾杀害我太湖税所干部董洪基与顾云初二人。此外徐菊初还经常率领他的土匪队伍在太湖抢劫旅客与货船，并伤过九条人命。例如有一次抢劫西湖运输公司的货船后，又把该船和乘客一起沉入湖内。并勾结广东帮制造毒丸，且武装掩护贩运。一九四二年，徐菊初又当了日寇的密探，并担任南方泉伪镇长。这时徐菊初更是倚仗敌人势力，绑架勒索，霸地占房，无所不为。一九四四年，徐菊初去苏北抗日根据地和徐栋见过一次面。徐菊初回家后，便成为两面派人物。一九四五年日本投降后，国民党反动政府曾以汉奸罪名判徐菊初十年徒刑，但至一九四八年又将徐释放，并委徐为当地的伪自卫团副团长。徐菊初即继续胡作非为，残害人民。无锡县解放后，进行减租时，徐菊初即违抗法令，对佃户说：“种我田的倒霉，我不能减租。”土地改革开始后，活动更甚，徐菊初就指使他的亲信狗腿徐荣培窃取村农会主任的职务，以阻止农民评他为地主成份。徐菊初又纠合地主徐建和等阴谋抵赖成份，逃避土地改革。同时指使徐荣培妻在划阶级时故意吵闹会场，以扰乱划阶级工作。徐菊初并对群众威胁说“不要神气，将来留心吃麻线子。”广大群众再也不能忍受徐菊初这种欺压剥削，即向人民政府控告。因此无锡县人民政府接受人民意见逮捕了徐菊初。无锡县人民政府，曾将徐菊初残害人民的一切罪行材料寄给徐栋一份，首先征求徐栋对这问题处理的意见。（编者按：先征求徐栋的意见是不对的）
    徐栋在该县土地改革前，曾将他的地主父亲拉入华东人民革命大学南京分校工作，以逃避群众斗争，后因他父亲不能工作被精简回乡。徐栋即写信给当地乡、村干部说他父亲是“临时任务回家”。当徐栋知道他父亲被捕后，不但不支持农民的此种正义行动与政府的正确处理，反而在一九五○年十一月十七日私自回家，到中共无锡县委会，替他父亲进行辩护。他说无锡县人民政府的材料是不确实的，他父亲没有犯罪，是个好人，政府不应逮捕；并要求召开群众会议讨论这件事情。此时徐栋把他的父亲从监狱中提出来在无锡县委会会客室谈了一次话。（编者按：徐栋凭什么权力随便从政府的监狱中提取犯人，尤其是提到无锡县委会会客室中谈话，无锡县人民政府与无锡县委会对此事亦应负责。）十九日县人民政府就在泥头桥召开群众大会，发动群众对徐菊初提意见。会上曾受过徐菊初迫害的干部首先起来控诉徐的罪状，这时徐菊初的三个狗腿就出来替徐辩护，再加徐栋在座，群众就不敢再提什么意见。
    十二月三日，徐栋又派他母亲与妻子去无锡县人民政府申辩，并要求无锡县委会写信批准搬运他家里的用具，县委未予同意。徐栋这时又接受地主张老太婆送给他的一枝手枪。走时，他便把张老太婆带走了，帮助她躲避了土地改革。
    徐栋回南京后，还和他父亲的亲信狗腿保持联系，经常听取这些人的汇报，并指挥这些人进行非法活动。同时不断地给无锡县委会写信，进行无理责难。不久，徐栋又用学校的打字机，打了一份诬蔑人民政府，诬蔑群众，而坚决包庇他地主家庭的十八页多的报告书，并将此报告书分寄给有关的干部与群众，破坏无锡县委和无锡县人民政府的领导威信，达到他包庇地主家庭的目的。这报告上面主要是说无锡县人民政府执行政策有错误，和歪曲中央人民政府政务院和华东军政委员会的土地改革法令，并再三提出“我还保留军籍，弟妹又已参加军队，故家庭应以革命军人家属论；何况我家成份基本上是贫苦中农”。徐栋并向中共南京市委无理要求成立“临时性的三人小组”（苏南行署一人无锡县委会一人和徐栋）以处理徐菊初问题。
    中共南京市委会为了严肃党的纪律与保持我党的纯洁，并经中共中央华东局批准，于二月十七日宣布开除徐栋党籍；并委托无锡县委会，向当地人民宣布这一决定。学校方面，亦撤销他的职务并移送法院，依法惩办。
