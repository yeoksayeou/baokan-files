　　Program of the Vietnam Workers' Party
    ——Passed by the National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party
            Chapter I: The World and Vietnam
    (1) After the Second World War, the fascism of Germany, Italy, and Japan collapsed, capitalism entered a serious crisis, the Soviet Union became increasingly prosperous and powerful, and the democratic movement developed daily. The world is divided into two camps: one is the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union against imperialism, and the other is the anti-democratic imperialist camp led by the United States.
    The democratic camp is growing stronger, and the imperialist camp is weakening. Due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the balance of power has shifted in favor of the democratic camp.
    Currently, US imperialists and their accomplices are frantically preparing for a third world war and attempting to expand their wars of aggression. Therefore, the central task of the working class and the people of the whole world is to fight to safeguard peace. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the world peace camp is strongly opposed to imperialist warmongers. The peace movement has grown unprecedentedly and extensively. For imperialists to launch a third world war is tantamount to suicide.
    (2) After the Second World War, the socialist movement has overwhelmed fascism. In Eastern Europe and the Far East, people's democratic revolutions have developed and triumphed in many countries. Many people's republics have been established and have broken away from the imperialist system. People's democratic regimes are becoming increasingly consolidated and are paving the way for socialism. Under the current world historical conditions, people's democracy is a bridge to socialism for many countries.
    (3) After the Second World War, the most significant characteristic of the world is the universal development of national liberation movements. This movement is growing stronger and shaking the entire imperialist system. It has become an inseparable part of the worldwide movement to fight for peace and democracy and against imperialist warmongers.
    British, French, Dutch, and other imperialists are using cunning schemes to deceive the people of the colonies, giving them false independence, buying off reactionary feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie, and dividing the people of these countries. They attempt to maintain their rule in these countries. Meanwhile, US imperialists are using all possible means to turn the colonies of other countries into markets for American goods and military bases for aggression.
    However, the people of the colonies and semi-colonies have increasingly recognized that the only path to national liberation is: national unity, close alliance with the people of other countries in the world, and the waging of a relentless and persistent armed struggle under the leadership of the working class. Experience shows that any oppressed nation that takes this path will surely achieve victory.
    (4) Vietnam is the outpost of the democratic camp in Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese revolution is a part of the world's national liberation and the movement to defend peace and democracy. The Vietnamese people are fighting for their own independence and freedom and are also helping to maintain world peace and develop people's democratic regimes in Southeast Asia. Thanks to the efforts of all the Vietnamese people and the progress of the democratic camp, especially the great victory of the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people's revolution will surely succeed.
            Chapter II: Vietnamese Society and the Vietnamese Revolution
    (1) Before being conquered by the French imperialists, Vietnamese society was a feudal society. Since the establishment of French rule, Vietnam became a market monopolized by French colonialists, a source of raw materials and manpower, a territory for usurious exploiters, and a military base.
    After the First World War, France began to operate mining and small-scale industry in Vietnam. The Vietnamese feudal system collapsed. The Vietnamese working class formed and matured rapidly. Vietnamese capitalism emerged, but failed to develop due to the oppression of French capitalism.
    The French colonial policy made Vietnam completely dependent on France. It hindered the development of Vietnam's productive forces. It combined capitalist forms of oppression and exploitation with feudal forms of oppression and exploitation, plunging the Vietnamese people, especially workers and peasants, into the darkest and most miserable situation. Therefore, the Vietnamese people have never stopped fighting for independence and democracy.
    The Indochinese Communist Party was established in 1930. Since then, the leadership of the revolution has been in the hands of the leaders of the Vietnamese working class.
    During the Second World War, the Japanese invaded Vietnam. Under the yoke of French and Japanese fascists, the Vietnamese people suffered greatly, and many uprisings broke out, establishing and developing guerrilla bases. After the incident launched by the Japanese in March 1945, the people's regime was established in the liberated area of ​​the Northern Highlands of Vietnam.
    Overall, Vietnamese society at this time was still a colonial and semi-feudal society.
    In 1945, under the deadly blows of the Soviet Red Army, the Japanese fascists surrendered. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Indochinese Communist Party, the Viet Minh Front and the Vietnamese people held a general uprising and achieved victory, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    However, the French imperialists invaded Vietnam again, attempting to reimpose their old colonial rule. The Vietnamese people then began a nationwide, comprehensive, and protracted war of resistance.
    US imperialists have been trying their best to help the French colonialists. However, due to the unity and concerted efforts of our people and the heroic combat of our army, the French colonialists can only occupy a part of our territory. In the struggle for liberation and democratic reforms in the economic, political, cultural, and social fields, Vietnam has embarked on the path of people's democracy.
    Therefore, the current society in Vietnam is a society of a people's democratic nature, and partly a colonial and semi-feudal society.
    (2) People's democracy is what the Vietnamese people yearn for, while the colonial system is a major disaster for them. The remnants of feudalism and semi-feudalism hinder the progress of the new Vietnam and subject most of the Vietnamese people, especially the peasants, to heavy oppression. All the Vietnamese people need independence and freedom and are determined not to be enslaved again. Most of the Vietnamese people—the peasants—need land.
    Therefore, the primary tasks of the Vietnamese revolution are to expel the imperialist aggressors, to achieve complete independence and unity for the people; to eliminate the colonial system in the enemy-occupied areas, to eradicate the remnants of feudalism and semi-feudalism, to give land to the tillers; to develop the people's democratic regime, and to lay the foundation for socialism.
    The driving force of the current Vietnamese revolution is the Vietnamese people, including workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, as well as patriotic and progressive people and patriotic and progressive landlords. The basic components of the people include workers, peasants, and intellectuals (intellectuals belong to all strata of the people, most of whom belong to the petty bourgeoisie). The leading class of the Vietnamese revolution is the working class.
    Judging from the basic tasks that the Vietnamese revolution must accomplish, and from the fact that the driving force of the Vietnamese revolution is the people led by the working class; the Vietnamese revolution is a national people's democratic revolution.
    This kind of national people's democratic revolution will lead the Vietnamese people towards socialism. The road to socialism is a road of long-term struggle that requires going through several stages.
    At the present stage, the spearhead of the Vietnamese revolution is directed against the imperialist aggressors. Its aim is to unite all the forces of the people, consolidate the national united front, and resolutely fight the imperialist aggressors and their lackeys. At the same time, it is also necessary to find ways to improve the living conditions of the people, especially the working masses, so that they can more actively participate in the war of resistance.
    The main task at the present stage is to oppose imperialist aggression. Other work must serve this task.
            Chapter III: The Policies of the Vietnam Workers' Party
    The Vietnam Workers' Party is determined to accomplish the cause of the liberation of the Vietnamese people, to restrain the forces of feudalism, to advance towards the road of eliminating feudal and semi-feudal remnants, to develop people's democracy, to build an independent, unified, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam, and to guide Vietnam towards socialism.
    During the liberation war and immediately after the end of the liberation war, in order to make the war of resistance achieve complete victory as soon as possible and to lay the foundation for building a prosperous and strong country, the Vietnam Workers' Party plans to implement the following policies:
        (1) Continue the war of resistance until complete victory
    All the Vietnamese people are determined to fight the war of resistance to the end in order to eliminate the French colonialists, defeat the American interventionists, punish the traitors, and make the motherland completely independent and unified. The Vietnamese people's war of liberation is a people's war, a comprehensive and protracted war on a national scale. It must go through three stages: the defensive stage, the attrition stage, and the counter-offensive stage. From now on until the final victory of the war of resistance, the central task of the Vietnamese people is to complete the preparation for the general counter-offensive and launch a victorious general counter-offensive. In order to win complete victory, they must mobilize manpower, material resources, and financial resources for the war of liberation in accordance with the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for victory," and constantly replenish the forces of combat. They must bear in mind the following strategic principles of the war of resistance:
    All political, economic, and cultural work must be aimed at guaranteeing military victory, and military struggle must be coordinated with political, economic, and cultural struggle.
    Frontline combat against the enemy must be closely coordinated with guerrilla warfare and sabotage work behind enemy lines.
    The Vietnamese people's war of liberation must be closely coordinated with the armed resistance of the people of Laos and Cambodia and the struggle of the people of the world for peace and democracy.
        (2) Consolidate the people's regime
    Our regime is a people's democratic regime, that is, a regime of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, patriotic and progressive people, and patriotic progressive landlords. The form of this regime is a people's democratic republic. Its essence is the people's democratic dictatorship: democracy for the people, dictatorship for imperialist aggressors and reactionaries.
    The people's regime relies on the national united front led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.
    The organizational principle of the people's regime is democratic centralism.
    The strength of our people's regime comes from the active participation and support of the people, from the leadership of the working class, and from the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. Therefore, in order to consolidate our people's regime, we must:
    Continuously strengthen the ties between the state regime and the broad masses of the people;
    Increase the number of workers, peasants, and women participating in government organizations, especially in the People's Committees;
    Formulate a truly people's democratic constitution;
    Strengthen the Party's leadership in government organizations at all levels;
    Strengthen the ties between Vietnam and the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.
            (3) Consolidate the national united front
    The Vietnamese national united front unites all political parties, people's organizations, and patriotic people, regardless of their class, nationality, religion, or gender, to jointly engage in the struggle for liberation and national construction.
    The national united front is one of the pillars of the people's regime. Its task is to mobilize, organize, educate, and lead the people to implement the government's policies, and to convey the people's wishes and opinions to the government. The Vietnam Workers' Party and the various political parties, people's organizations, and individuals within the national united front closely cooperate in accordance with the following principles: sincere unity with each other, conducting friendly criticism to promote common progress, cooperation and consultation, and striving to implement a common program for long-term cooperation during the protracted war of resistance and after the end of the war of resistance. In order to strengthen the national united front, we must complete the merger of Viet Minh and Viet Lien; consolidate the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals to make it a solid foundation for the united front; mobilize the bourgeoisie and landlords to actively participate in Viet Lien; develop the organization of the united front in enemy-occupied areas, areas of religious belief, and areas of ethnic minorities; and consolidate the Party's leadership within the united front.
        (4) Establish and develop the People's Army
    The Vietnamese army is a people's army composed of the people, supported and assisted by the people, and fighting for the interests of the people. It has a national, popular, and democratic nature.
    Its discipline is a very strict and conscious discipline. In combat, it also conducts extensive political work, strengthens the unity between the army itself and between the army and the people, and strives to carry out propaganda work in the enemy army to demoralize the enemy.
    In order to establish and develop the People's Army, we must develop the People's Army local forces, militia, and guerrillas in the countryside, and select mercenaries who have been captured by us or who have surrendered to us in order to constantly replenish our regular army. At the same time, we must seize the enemy's weapons, ammunition, and food supplies in order to partially solve the problem of equipment and supplies.
        (5) Develop the economy
    Our current economic policy is to give consideration to both public and private interests, to benefit both labor and capital, to increase production, to meet the needs of the war of liberation, and to improve the living standards of the people.
    At present, it is necessary to pay attention to the development of agriculture, industry, handicrafts, and domestic trade, to establish trade relations with other countries, to lay the foundation for the state-owned economy, and to develop the cooperative economy. As for the national bourgeoisie, our Party should try to encourage, assist, and guide their operations.
    In terms of finance, we advocate increasing revenue by increasing production, reducing expenditure, strengthening thrift, and democratic donations.
    Regarding the enemy's economy, we advocate carrying out planned destruction and blockade under conditions that are beneficial to the war of liberation and beneficial to the people; confiscating the property of imperialist aggressors and traitors, and letting the people's regime control it.
        (6) Implement land reform
    Our current land policy is to implement rent reduction, interest reduction, and other reforms, such as: adjusting the tenant system; temporarily distributing land formerly belonging to imperialists and traitors to poor peasants, disabled soldiers, and families of martyrs; redistributing public land; and rationally utilizing land belonging to absentee landlords and wasteland, etc. These reforms must be thoroughly implemented in order to improve the living conditions of the peasants, to enable the people of the whole country—most of whom are peasants—to participate in the armed resistance on a larger scale, to increase production, and to guarantee supplies.
    In order to systematically implement these reforms, our Party must organize and awaken the peasant masses and steadily lead the peasant movement.
    We must implement this land policy step by step according to local conditions. Land is more concentrated in South Vietnam than in North and Central Vietnam, so this policy should be implemented at a greater pace in South Vietnam.
    We must prepare the conditions so that every peasant can gradually get his own land.
        (7) Develop culture and education
    In order to cultivate new talents and new cadres and to promote the war of liberation and national construction, it is necessary to eliminate the remnants of colonial and feudal culture and education and to develop a national, scientific, and popular culture and education.
    Therefore, the tasks of Vietnamese culture and education at the present stage are:
    To inspire the people's hatred for the imperialist aggressors and promote their patriotism and internationalism;
    To promote the essence of people's culture while learning from the world's progressive culture, especially the culture of the Soviet Union and China;
    To develop the culture of ethnic minorities;
    To develop the people's science, technology, and art;
    To mobilize the people to implement a new way of life;
    To eliminate illiteracy, reform the education system, and develop vocational schools.
        (8) The Party's attitude towards religion
    The Vietnam Workers' Party respects and guarantees the people's freedom of religious belief and opposes the policy of the French imperialists to use religion to deceive the people and divide the Vietnamese national united front.
        (9) The Party's policy towards ethnic minorities
    All ethnic groups within Vietnam are equal in rights and obligations; they must unite and help each other to carry out armed resistance and national construction.
    Our Party resolutely opposes narrow nationalism and resolutely smashes the conspiracy of imperialists and traitors to sow seeds of hatred and divide ethnic groups. Our Party will try to improve the living standards of ethnic minorities, assist them in making progress in all aspects of their activities, and guarantee their participation in the people's regime. Each ethnic minority will study in its own national language.
        (10) The Party's policy towards enemy-occupied areas and newly liberated areas
    We attach equal importance to work in enemy-occupied areas and work in liberated areas. Work in enemy-occupied areas includes implementing broad unity among people of all strata, strengthening guerrilla warfare, establishing and consolidating the people's regime, destroying the puppet regime, disintegrating the mercenaries, mobilizing the people to engage in the struggle against enemy oppression and exploitation, and coordinating the activities of the enemy-occupied areas and the activities of the liberated areas.
    As for the enemy's lackeys, we advocate punishing the most heinous traitors who refuse to repent, and implementing a lenient policy towards those misguided people who are willing to reform themselves and return to the motherland.
    Regarding newly liberated areas, we advocate implementing unity among the people, maintaining law and order, strictly guarding against and eliminating spies, and restoring the economy.
        (11) Foreign policy
    Vietnam's foreign policy must be based on the principles of mutual respect for national independence and territorial integrity, equality of rights, and defending world peace and democracy.
    Our Party advocates strengthening friendly relations between Vietnam and the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, actively supporting the national liberation movements of colonial and semi-colonial countries, establishing diplomatic relations with all countries that are willing to respect Vietnamese national sovereignty on the basis of freedom, equality, and mutual benefit. We advocate expanding people's diplomacy and protecting overseas Vietnamese.
        (12) Our policy towards Laos and Cambodia
    The Vietnamese people must closely unite with the people of Laos and Cambodia and give them full assistance in the common struggle against imperialist aggression in order to complete the liberation of Indochina and maintain world peace. On the basis of the common interests of the three peoples, the Vietnamese people are willing to cooperate with the people of Laos and Cambodia for a long time and strive to achieve sincere unity among the three peoples.
        (13) Our policy towards foreigners
    All foreigners who respect Vietnamese laws are protected in their lives and property. They have the right to reside in Vietnam and engage in business. Foreigners belonging to people's democratic countries, especially overseas Chinese in Vietnam, can enjoy the same rights and fulfill the same obligations as Vietnamese citizens if they are willing and are approved by their national government and the Vietnamese People's Government.
        (14) Struggle for world peace and democracy
    Fighting to defend world peace and democracy is the international task of the Vietnamese people. Fighting the imperialist aggressors is the most active means for our people to accomplish this task.
    We advocate that the Vietnamese people combine their war of liberation with the struggles of the people of other countries in the world, especially the French people and the people of the French colonies.
        (15) Patriotic emulation
    The patriotic emulation movement is a nationwide movement carried out in various sectors of activity, the main purpose of which is to defeat the three enemies—illiteracy, famine, and foreign aggression.
    The military, villages, state-owned enterprises, schools, and government agencies are the main places for carrying out the emulation movement.
    We advocate commending heroes and labor fighters in the emulation to mobilize all the people to participate in the war of liberation and national construction.

### 越南劳动党纲领——越南劳动党全国代表大会通过

专栏：

　　越南劳动党纲领
    ——越南劳动党全国代表大会通过
            第一章  世界与越南
    （一）第二次世界大战以后，德国、意大利和日本的法西斯主义已经崩溃，资本主义进入严重的危机，苏联日益繁荣与强大，民主运动日益发展。世界分裂为两个阵营：一个是以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的民主阵营，一个是以美国为首的反民主的帝国主义阵营。
    民主阵营日益强大，帝国主义阵营日益削弱。由于中国人民的革命获得胜利和德意志民主共和国的建立，力量的对比已有利于民主阵营。
    目前美帝国主义者及其同谋者正在疯狂地准备第三次世界大战，并企图扩大侵略战争。因此，全世界工人阶级与人民的中心任务就是为维护和平而斗争。在苏联领导之下，世界和平阵营正在强烈地反对帝国主义战争贩子。和平运动已经空前壮大与广泛。帝国主义者要发动第三次世界大战就等于自杀。
    （二）第二次世界大战以后，社会主义运动已经压倒了法西斯主义。在东欧和远东，人民民主革命已在许多国家内发展并获得胜利。许多人民共和国已经建立并脱离了帝国主义的体系。人民民主政权日益巩固，并正在为社会主义铺平道路。在目前世界历史条件之下，人民民主是许多国家走向社会主义的桥梁。
    （三）第二次世界大战以后，世界的显著特点就是民族解放运动的普遍发展，这种运动正在日益壮大，并震撼着整个帝国主义的体系。它已成为全世界争取和平与民主以及反对帝国主义战争贩子运动的不可分的一部分。
    英国、法国、荷兰及其他帝国主义者正在使用狡计，欺骗殖民地人民，给他们以假的独立，收买反动的封建地主和买办资产阶级，分化这些国家的人民。他们企图保持他们在这些国家的统治。而美帝国主义者则使用一切可能的手段，把其他国家的殖民地变为美国商品的市场和侵略的军事基地。
    然而，殖民地与半殖民地的人民已日益认识民族解放的唯一道路是：全国团结，与世界其他各国人民密切联合，在工人阶级领导之下进行无情的坚持的武装斗争。经验表明：任何被压迫民族只要采取这条道路，就一定能取得胜利。
    （四）越南是民主阵营在东南亚的前哨。越南革命是全世界民族解放与保卫和平及民主运动的一部分。越南人民为争取他们自己的独立与自由而斗争，也帮助了世界和平的维持与东南亚人民民主政权的发展。由于越南全体人民的努力和民主阵营的进步，特别是中国人民的伟大胜利，越南人民的革命一定会成功。
            第二章  越南社会与越南革命
    （一）在被法帝国主义者征服以前，越南社会是一个封建社会。自从法国的统治建立以后，越南成为法国殖民主义者所独占的市场、原料和人力的来源、高利贷剥削者的地盘和军事基地。
    在第一次世界大战以后，法国就开始在越南经营矿业和小型工业。越南的封建制度崩溃了。越南工人阶级形成了并迅速地成熟。越南资本主义虽已产生，但由于法国资本主义的压迫而未能发展。
    法国的殖民政策使得越南完全依附法国。它阻碍了越南生产力的发展。它把资本主义的压迫与剥削方式和封建的压迫与剥削方式结合在一起，把越南人民特别是工人与农民陷入最黑暗的悲惨境地。因此，越南人民从未停止过争取独立与民主的斗争。
    一九三○年印度支那共产党建立。从此以后，革命的领导权一直在越南工人阶级领导者的手里。
    第二次世界大战期间，日本人侵入越南。在法、日法西斯的枷锁之下，越南人民饱受痛苦，于是爆发了许多次的起义，并建立和发展了游击战根据地。在一九四五年三月日本人所发动的事变以后，人民政权就在北越高原的解放区内成立。
    整个来说，越南社会这时仍然是殖民地与半封建社会。
    一九四五年，在苏联红军的致命打击之下，日本法西斯分子投降。在胡志明主席与印度支那共产党领导之下，越盟阵线与越南人民举行总起义并取得胜利，建立了越南民主共和国。
    但是，法帝国主义者又侵入越南，企图重新实行旧的殖民统治。越南人民就开始了全国规模的全面而持久的抗战。
    美帝国主义者竭力帮助法国殖民者。然而由于我国人民的团结一致和同心协力以及我们军队的英勇作战，法国殖民者只能占据我国领土的一部分。在争取解放与在经济、政治、文化和社会各方面的民主改革的斗争过程中，越南已经走上人民民主的大道。
    因此，越南目前的社会是人民民主性质的社会，而一部分又是殖民地与半封建的社会。
    （二）人民民主是越南人民所渴望的，而殖民制度却是他们的一大灾害。封建主义与半封建主义的残余阻碍了新越南的进步，使越南大部分人民，特别是农民，受到沉重的压迫。越南全体人民都需要独立与自由，决不愿再被奴役。越南的大部分人民——农民——需要土地。
    因此，越南革命的首要任务就是要驱逐帝国主义侵略者，使人民得到完全的独立与统一；消灭敌占区内的殖民制度，根绝封建主义与半封建主义的残余，使耕者有其田；发展人民民主政权，并为社会主义奠定基础。
    目前越南革命的动力是越南人民，包括工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级，以及爱国的和进步的人士与爱国的及进步的地主。人民的基本组成，包括工人、农民和脑力劳动者（脑力劳动者属于各阶层人民，大部属于小资产阶级）。越南革命的领导阶级是工人阶级。
    从越南革命所要完成的基本任务来看，以及从越南革命的动力是由工人阶级所领导的人民的这一事实来看，越南革命是一个民族的人民民主革命。
    这种民族的人民民主革命，将引导越南人民走向社会主义。走向社会主义的道路，是一条须要经过若干阶段的长期斗争的道路。
    在目前阶段，越南革命的矛头是针对着帝国主义侵略者。它的目的是要团结人民的一切力量，巩固民族统一阵线，坚决地对帝国主义侵略者及其走狗们战斗。同时，它还要设法改善人民的、特别是劳动群众的生活条件，好使他们更积极地参加抗战。
    目前阶段的主要任务，是反对帝国主义的侵略。其他工作必须服务于这一任务。
            第三章  越南劳动党的政策
    越南劳动党决心完成越南人民的解放事业，抑制封建主义的势力，向着消灭封建与半封建残余的道路前进，发展人民民主，建立一个独立、统一、民主、繁荣和强大的越南，并引导越南走向社会主义。
    在解放战争期间及解放战争一结束以后，为了使得抗战早日获得完全的胜利，并为建设繁荣而强大的国家奠定基础，越南劳动党计划实行下列的政策：
        （一）继续抗战直到完全胜利
    越南全体人民都决心抗战到底，以便肃清法国殖民者，击败美国干涉者，惩办卖国贼，使祖国得到完全的独立和统一。越南人民的解放战争是人民的战争，是一个全国规模的全面的和持久的战争。它必须经过三个阶段：防御阶段，消耗战阶段，反攻阶段。越南人民从今以后一直到抗战最后胜利为止的中心任务，是完成总反攻的准备并发动胜利的总反攻。为了赢得完全的胜利，他们必须依照“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号，动员人力、物力和财力以供解放战争之用，并不断地补充战斗的力量。他们必须牢记以下的抗战战略原则：
    一切政治、经济与文化的工作，必须以保证军事胜利为目的，军事斗争必须得到政治、经济与文化斗争的配合。
    前线的对敌战斗，必须与敌后的游击战斗及破坏工作密切配合。
    越南人民的解放战争，必须与老挝及柬埔寨人民的武装抗战以及全世界争取和平与民主的斗争密切配合。
        （二）巩固人民政权
    我国的政权是人民民主政权，也就是工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、爱国的与进步的人士以及爱国的与进步的地主的政权。这种政权的形式是人民民主共和国。它的本质是人民民主专政：对人民实行民主，对帝国主义侵略者与反动派实行专政。
    人民政权所依靠的是以工人阶级为领导的，以工人、农民与脑力劳动者的联盟为基础的民族统一阵线。
    人民政权的组织原则是民主集中制。
    我们人民政权的力量来自人民的积极参加和支持，来自工人阶级的领导，来自苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的帮助。因此，为了巩固我们人民政权，我们就必须：
    不断加强国家政权与人民大众间的联系；
    增加参加政府组织的特别是参加人民委员会的工人、农民与妇女的人数；
    拟定真正的人民民主的宪法；
    加强党在各级政府组织中的领导；
    加强越南与苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家间的联系。
            （三）巩固民族统一阵线
    越南民族统一阵线团结各政党、人民团体和爱国人士，而不论其阶级、民族、宗教与性别，以共同从事解放斗争与国家建设的斗争。
    民族统一阵线是人民政权的支柱之一。它的任务是动员、组织、教育和领导人民实行政府的政策，并把人民的愿望与意见转达给政府。越南劳动党与民族统一阵线内的各政党、人民团体及人士，依照下列原则密切合作：彼此真诚团结，进行友谊的批评，以促进共同的进步、合作与协商，为实行在持久抗战期间及抗战结束以后长期合作的共同纲领而奋斗。为了加强民族统一阵线，我们必须完成越盟与越联的合并工作；巩固工人、农民和脑力劳动者的联盟，使其成为统一阵线的巩固基础；动员资产阶级和地主积极参加越联；在敌占区、信仰宗教的民族的地区及少数民族地区发展统一阵线的组织；巩固党在统一阵线内的领导。
        （四）建立和发展人民军
    越南军队是由人民所组成、受到人民的拥护和协助、并为人民的利益而战斗的人民军队。它具有民族的、人民大众的和民主的性质。
    它的纪律，是非常严格的自觉的纪律。在作战的时候，它还进行广泛的政治工作，加强军队本身和军队与人民之间的团结，努力在敌军中进行宣传工作，瓦解敌军士气。
    为了建立和发展人民军，我们必须在农村中发展人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队，并选拔被我们俘掳的或向我们投诚的雇佣兵，以便不断地补充我们的正规军。同时，我们必须缴获敌军的武器、弹药和粮食供应，借以部分地解决装备与给养问题。
        （五）发展经济
    我们目前的经济政策是公私兼顾，劳资两利，增加生产，以适应解放战争的需要，提高人民的生活水平。
    目前必须注意发展农业、工业、手工业和国内的贸易，与其他国家建立贸易关系，奠定国营经济的基础，发展合作经济。至于民族资产阶级，我党要设法鼓励、协助和指导他们的经营。
    在财政方面，我们主张用增加生产、减少开支、加强节约和民主捐献的方法来增加收入。
    关于敌人的经济，我们主张在有利于解放战争和有利于人民的条件下，进行有计划的破坏和封锁；没收帝国主义侵略者与卖国贼的财产，由人民政权支配。
        （六）实行土地改革
    我们目前的土地政策是实行减租、减息及其他改革，例如：调整租佃制度；将以前属于帝国主义者与卖国贼的土地暂时分配给贫农、残废军人和烈士家属；重新分配公共的土地；合理地利用属于不在地主的土地和荒地等。这些改革必须彻底实行，以改善农民的生活条件，使全国人民——大部分是农民——更多地大批参加武装抗战，提高生产并保证供应。
    为了有系统地实行这些改革，我党必须组织与唤醒农民群众，并稳步地领导农民运动。
    我们必须根据当地的情况，有步骤地实行这种土地政策。南越的土地比较北越与中越的土地更为集中，在南越，就应以更大的速度实行这种政策。
    我们必须准备各种条件，使每个农民都能逐渐得到他自己的土地。
        （七）发展文化与教育
    为了培养新的人材和新的干部，并推进解放战争和国家建设，必须肃清殖民地的和封建的文化与教育的残余，并发展一种民族的、科学的和人民大众的文化与教育。
    因此，越南文化与教育在目前阶段的任务是：
    启发人民对帝国主义侵略者的仇恨，发扬他们的爱国主义和国际主义精神；
    发扬人民文化的精华，同时学习世界的进步文化，特别是苏联和中国的文化；
    发展少数民族的文化；
    发展人民的科学、技术和艺术；
    动员人民实行一种新的生活方式；
    消除文盲，改革教育制度，发展职业学校。
        （八）党对宗教的态度
    越南劳动党尊重并保障人民信仰宗教的自由，反对法帝国主义者利用宗教来欺骗人民和分化越南民族统一阵线的政策。
        （九）党对少数民族的政策
    越南境内的一切民族，在权利与义务上一律平等；他们必须团结互助，以进行武装抗战与国家建设。
    我党坚决反对狭隘的民族主义，坚决粉碎帝国主义者与卖国贼在各民族间散布仇恨种子和分化各民族的阴谋。我党要设法提高少数民族的生活水平，协助他们在各方面的活动获得进步，保证他们参加人民政权。每一少数民族都将用他们自己民族的语文去学习。
        （十）党对敌占区和新解放区的政策
    我们对敌占区的工作和解放区的工作同样重视。敌占区的工作包括实行各阶层人民的广泛团结，加强游击战争，建立和巩固人民政权，摧毁伪政权，瓦解雇佣兵，动员人民从事反对敌人压迫和剥削的斗争，使敌占区的活动和解放区的活动互相配合。
    至于对敌人的走狗，我们主张惩办怙恶不悛的首恶的卖国贼，对于愿意改过自新并回到祖国方面来的误入歧途的人们，则实行宽大政策。
    关于新解放地区，我们主张在人民中实行团结，维持治安，严防并肃清特务，恢复经济。
        （十一）外交政策
    越南的外交政策，必须根据互相尊重国家独立与领土完整、权利平等及保卫世界和平与民主的原则。
    我党主张加强越南与苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家间的友好关系，积极支持各殖民地与半殖民地国家的民族解放运动，在自由、平等与互利的基础上，与一切愿意尊重越南国家主权的国家建立外交关系。我们主张扩大人民的外交，保护国外的越侨。
        （十二）我们对老挝和柬埔寨的政策
    越南人民必须与老挝及柬埔寨人民密切团结，并在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中给他们以全力的援助，以完成印度支那的解放和维护世界和平。在三国人民共同利益的基础上，越南人民愿与老挝及柬埔寨人民长期合作，并努力实现三国人民间的真诚团结。
        （十三）我们对外侨的政策
    尊重越南法律的一切外侨，他们的生命财产都受到保护。他们有在越南境内居住和经营商业的权利。属于人民民主国家的外侨，特别是在越南的华侨，假若他们愿意并得到他们本国政府和越南人民政府的批准，可以像越南公民一样地享受同样的权利和尽同样的义务。
        （十四）为世界和平与民主而斗争
    为保卫世界和平与民主而斗争是越南人民的国际任务。对帝国主义侵略者战斗，是我国人民完成这种任务的最积极的手段。
    我们主张越南人民将他们的解放战争与世界其他国家的人民特别是法国人民与法国殖民地人民的斗争配合起来。
        （十五）爱国主义竞赛
    爱国主义竞赛运动是一种在各种活动部门中进行的全国规模的运动，其主要目的是击败三个敌人——文盲、饥荒和外国的侵略。
    军队、乡村、国有企业、学校和政府机关是进行竞赛运动的主要场所。
    我们主张表扬竞赛中的英雄和劳动战士，借以动员全体人民参加解放战争与国家建设。
