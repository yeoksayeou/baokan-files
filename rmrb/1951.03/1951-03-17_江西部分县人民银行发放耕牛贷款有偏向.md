    Partiality in People's Bank of China's Loan Issuance for Draft Cattle in Some Counties of Jiangxi

To the Editor:

    Since the agricultural loan conference held in Jiangxi Province last November, over 5.484 billion yuan in draft cattle loans has been issued, enough to purchase more than 15,870 head of draft cattle, solving the difficulty of lacking cattle for more than 30,000 poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants.

    However, we have also discovered some partiality in the issuance of loans. For example, Guangfeng County in eastern Jiangxi does not lack draft cattle, and the price of cattle is very low. However, the county's People's Bank of China issued loans for 76 head of draft cattle at high prices. I believe this is a significant waste. Another example is the rough and careless work of the Fengcheng County People's Bank of China branch. They completed the loan issuance work for three administrative villages in one day, and most of the loans were given to village cadres, while the masses who urgently needed loans did not receive them, causing dissatisfaction among local farmers. Based on the above situation, I hope that banks in various regions will conduct thorough investigation work beforehand when handling loans. When determining loan recipients, it should be done through democratic appraisal to truly solve the difficulties of households lacking cattle. If the number of loans is too small to universally meet the needs of farmers, priority lending must be given to solve the problem and gain the support of the farmers.

### 江西部分县人民银行发放耕牛贷款有偏向

    江西部分县人民银行发放耕牛贷款有偏向编辑同志：
    江西省自去年十一月召开农业贷款会议以来，已发放耕牛贷款五十四亿八千四百多万元，可购耕牛一万五千八百七十余头，解决了三万多户贫雇农和中农缺牛的困难。
    在发放贷款中，我们也发现了一些偏向。如赣东广丰县耕牛本来就不缺乏，牛的价格也很低，但该县人民银行却以高价贷出七十六头耕牛的贷款，我认为这是一笔很大的浪费。又如丰城县人民银行支行工作粗枝大叶，一天之内发放了三个行政村的贷款工作，而大部分款是贷给了村干部，迫切需要贷款的群众反而没有得到，引起了当地农民的不满。根据上述情况，我希望各地银行办理贷款时，应该在事前做好充分的调查工作；而在确定发放贷款户时，应该通过民主评议的方式，这样才能真正解决缺牛户的困难。如果贷款数过少，不能普遍满足农民需要时，必须重点贷放，才能解决问题和取得农民的拥护。
