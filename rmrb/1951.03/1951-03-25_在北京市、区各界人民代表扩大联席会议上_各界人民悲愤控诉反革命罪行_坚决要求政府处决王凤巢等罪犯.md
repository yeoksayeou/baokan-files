At the Enlarged Joint Conference of People's Representatives from All Circles in Beijing Municipality and Districts
People from All Circles Indignantly Accuse Counter-Revolutionary Crimes
Firmly Demand the Government to Execute Criminals such as Wang Fengchao

At the enlarged joint conference of people's representatives from all circles in Beijing Municipality and Districts, Sun Hongquan, a worker from Hongxing Factory, Su Deping, a farmer, Shang Linshi, a woman, Xu Yingchao, a professor at Beijing Normal University, and Liu Pengzhi, a student from Hebei High School, and 13 others who had personally suffered from the poisonous harm of counter-revolutionary elements, indignantly accused the heinous crimes of Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs, military and central bureau secret agents, habitual bandits, and leaders of reactionary secret societies, Wang Fengchao, Wang Tingshu, Leng Shaoying, and others. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government sentence these bandits to the ultimate penalty.

The first to step onto the stage was Sun Hongquan, a worker from Hongxing Factory, who had been strangled eight times by the notorious black gunner and secret agent bandit Wang Fengchao. He said: "Around 7 o'clock one evening in March 1949, the Wang bandit Fengchao and his son Wang Xiufeng, under the false pretense of the Beijing Municipal Military Control Commission, sneaked into my house and used a pistol to my chest, demanding gold. When they didn't get it, they stuffed my mouth with cloth, tied my feet, and strangled me eight times with a rope. It wasn't until 5 o'clock the next morning that the two bandits took my bicycle, watch, gold ring, and many clothes and swaggered away. The People's Government must severely punish a counter-revolutionary element as heinous as Wang bandit, in order to avenge me and the more than four hundred compatriots who were killed by him in Hejian area of Hebei Province."

Secret Agent Shi Yuling Leads the Home-Returning Corps, Killing More Than Forty Revolutionary Cadres

Wang Zhanlong, a farmer from Qiaohuying Village, Outer Thirteenth District, Mentougou, a suburb of Beijing, said: "Shi Yuling is a well-known secret agent and local tyrant. During the period of Japanese occupation, he exchanged 160 yuan of puppet currency for 160 silver dollars from me. In 1944, when our area was liberated and rent reduction and interest rate reduction were implemented, I asked the Shi bandit to return this old debt and got back three mu of land. Later, the Shi bandit secretly ran to Beiping, colluded with the reactionary landlord Liu Hongrui to organize the Home-Returning Corps. In 1946, when our area was reoccupied by the Chiang bandit army, the Shi bandit returned with the Home-Returning Corps, raping, pillaging, and killing, committing all kinds of evil deeds. More than forty revolutionary cadres were killed by them and thrown into the yellow earth pit. I was captured by the bandits, suffered countless beatings, and was force-fed five pots of cold water, experiencing death and resurrection several times. My wife was about to give birth at that time, but she was viciously kicked by the Shi bandit, and the child died after being born. Honorary soldier Li Zhong and General Ye Jianying's communicator Lao Peng were both buried alive by the Shi bandit. Once, the Shi bandit led a group of bandits to Changxindian, intercepted ten transport vehicles of the People's Liberation Army, and also shot and killed three cadres. If we add the three fellow villagers who were oppressed to death by the Shi bandit during the Japanese puppet period, he killed a total of nine people. After liberation, the Shi bandit was arrested by the People's Government, but the People's Government only sentenced him to fifteen years in prison. All twenty-nine households in our village demand that he be skinned alive."

Leng Shaoying Creates the "April 9th" Bloodshed, Brutally Beats University Students, Arrests Professors

Xu Yingchao, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said: "In 1948, under the direction of Leng Shaoying, the intelligence section chief and student movement section chief of the Central Bureau secret agent's North China office, the "April 9th" bloodshed occurred at Normal University. I witnessed the bandits' atrocities of brutally beating students and saw the blood all over the room and on the ground. I once indignantly launched professors to petition the reactionary government. Therefore, I forged a hatred with the secret agents. One night, a dozen secret agents surrounded my dormitory, with four guns pointing at me from all directions, and even my children were pointed at with guns. After I was arrested, the secret agents insisted that I was a member of the Democratic League and forced me to hand over the list and radio stations, etc. I am not a member of the Democratic League, so what list can I hand over. The secret agents tortured me severely, applying levers and pouring cold water. I fainted six times in succession. When I woke up, I found myself sleeping on the ground in a room with ventilation on all four walls, and my legs could no longer move. The next day, another secret agent called "Human Cook" continued to interrogate me. They tied my hands behind my back, hung me on the beam, and then two military policemen kicked me with their feet and branded me with red-hot iron, leaving me covered in scars all over my body. How vicious and cruel were the methods of the secret agent bandits! I have been at Normal University for more than twenty years, and the entire faculty and students know that I honestly teach and never interfere in politics, but I never expected to suffer such poisonous harm from the secret agents. Today, I demand that the People's Government shoot these heinous bandits and resolutely implement the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. As many counter-revolutionary elements as this, no matter how many there are, should be killed, and no leniency should be shown. Because if this is not done, kind-hearted ordinary people will continue to suffer their harm."

"Rather Kill a Hundred by Mistake Than Let One Go" Chen Zidan Opposes the People Heart and Soul

Liu Pengzhi, a student from Hebei High School, said: "Not long after the "April 9th" bloodshed at Normal University in 1948, one night, many secret agents holding pistols, grenades, wooden sticks, iron bars, and even large war knives used by Japanese soldiers suddenly rushed into the auditorium of our school. The entire faculty and students who were holding a get-together were immediately thrown into chaos, and I was surrounded by several secret agents. A secret agent named Chen Zidan struck me on the head with a knife, and blood immediately stained my whole body and soaked my clothes. As soon as I turned my head, I was hit again with a stick, three teeth were broken, and two cuts were opened on my head. I fainted immediately. The next day, I and fifteen classmates were sent to the special agent company of the puppet Hebei Provincial Security Command, where we were detained for three and a half months, and then sent to the Kuomintang artillery bureau's prison, where we were detained for another three months. The cruel situation in which the secret agents tortured us is truly unimaginable. A classmate named Fu Zongshun was made to stand on a brick, holding his hands up, and not allowed to drink water for seventy-two hours. On the third day, Fu Zongshun couldn't hold on any longer, closed his eyes, and fell down, but the secret agents used wet, thick hemp ropes to beat him viciously. In this way, the nerves in half of classmate Fu Zongshun's body were damaged and have not yet recovered. Today we are here to accuse the secret agents of their crimes, and I still clearly remember what the secret agent Chen Zidan said to me: "There are many high school students in the country, so what does it matter if we kill sixteen of you. We would rather kill a hundred by mistake than let one Communist go." How vicious are the secret agent bandits! But today they have finally fallen into the hands of the people, and the secret agent Chen Zidan, who personally beat me, will also be sanctioned by the people. I am very happy in my heart."

Wang Yuzhong, a worker from the streetcar company, accused Ma Zhenyuan, a Chiang bandit central bureau secret agent, of the atrocities he committed against him. He said: "On March 24, 1947, Ma Zhenyuan arrested twenty-seven of our workers, insisting that we were Communists and torturing us in every possible way. Ma Zhenyuan inserted bamboo sticks into my finger gaps, used the tip of a bullet to draw on worker Ji Wentian's ribs, and used a lever to press worker Li Ziquan unconscious several times. Even now, he still has scars on his legs." At this time, the perpetrator of the workers, Ma Zhenyuan, was escorted to the venue. All the representatives showed the greatest indignation, and Wang Yuzhong excitedly pointed at the Ma bandit and said: "It's this bastard! It was he who arrested twenty-seven of us, wanting to curry favor with Chiang Kai-shek and become a puppet national representative." As he said this, his face turned pale with anger. Su Deping, a resident of Shijia Village in the southern suburbs, and his family of three came to accuse Wang Fengchao of his crimes. Su Deping accused: "My family was robbed by Wang Fengchao three times in ten years, causing my whole family to have no clothes or food. The first time he robbed my daughter, and I spent a lot of money to redeem her. The second time he kidnapped my wife and daughter again, and I bankrupted myself to redeem them. The third time Wang Fengchao robbed my mother and there has been no news of her. It wasn't until a few days ago that the People's Government found my mother's body in a pit two zhang deep in Wang Fengchao's house, with a rope still tied around her neck. I demand that the government shoot him and avenge my deceased mother!"

Shang, an old lady from the Fifth District of Changxindian, walked tremblingly onto the stage, pointed at the secret agent element Li Tiebao standing at the corner of the stage and scolded: "My son Shang Dexiang's life was lost in your hands! That year, he carried a load of salt, and you saw it. The salt load was taken away, and the person was arrested. You have lost all conscience and used a pickaxe to chop my son. Who knows how many people you have chopped?!" The old lady was so grief-stricken that she couldn't continue speaking and was helped off the stage.

Fan Zhong, a farmer from the northern suburbs, accused the crimes of the central bureau secret agents, local tyrants and habitual bandits Lu Huanzhong and Lu Huanshan, brothers, saying: "My father was treated to death with fire tongs by the two brothers. The family couldn't afford one thousand catties of old corn for the burial money, and pitifully my father's body was dragged away and eaten by wild dogs. Seven lives in the nearby three villages were lost in the hands of these two guys. They also raped ten or so women in the village. And once, they secretly harmed a dozen or so procurement personnel of the Eighth Route Army. The people of the northern suburbs can't wait to chop the two brothers into meat paste!"

Wang Fa and Wen Yongjiu, workers from the People's Printing Factory, accused Wang Tingshu, a secret agent, gangster, and leader of Yiguandao altar with the nicknames "Southern Tyrant" and "Living阎王." He arrested and killed more than forty revolutionary workers, and more than a dozen workers from the People's Printing Factory alone died in his hands. Wen Yongjiu's younger brother was treated to death by him. There were more than a dozen households that were ruined by him. Wang Fa's father was so angered by him that he died. "Drag him to the southern suburbs and shoot him!" Wang Fa shouted out the voice of the people in the southern suburbs.

Deng Xiao, a student from Peking University who participated in the "May 20th" student movement in 1947 and was surrounded and beaten by secret agents in Xidan, sadly narrated the situation at that time when secret agents were rampant, chasing after unarmed students with iron bars and spiked "Zhongzheng sticks." He shouted: "Now that we have the People's Government to support us, we will resolutely punish these counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people!"

Those who accused the counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes at the meeting also included Qiu Xien, a graduate of Normal University, and He Jianzhang, a former student of Chaoyang University. During the accusations, more than 5,000 representatives attending the meeting and people from various agencies and organizations attending as observers shouted in unison: "Blood debts must be paid in blood!" "Avenge the victims!" "Demand that the government resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!" The counter-revolutionary elements Wang Fengchao, Wang Tingshu, Leng Shaoying and other counter-revolutionary elements who were escorted to the front of the stage, all looked pale. Countless angry eyes, huge accusations and demonstrating roars, made these counter-revolutionary criminals lower their heads and await the final judgment of the people.

　　在北京市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议上
    各界人民悲愤控诉反革命罪行
    坚决要求政府处决王凤巢等罪犯
    在北京市市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议上，亲身遭受反革命分子毒害的，洪兴工厂工人孙鸿全、农民苏德平、妇女尚林氏、北京师范大学教授徐英超、河北高中学生刘鹏志等十八人悲愤控诉国民党反动匪帮军统、中统特务、惯匪、反动会道门匪首王凤巢、王廷枢、冷少颖等的万恶罪行，一致要求人民政府判处这些匪徒以极刑。
    第一个走上台去的，是被特务匪徒著名黑枪手王凤巢用绳子勒死过去八次的洪兴工厂工人孙鸿全。他说：一九四九年三月某天晚上七点钟，王匪凤巢和他儿子王秀峰假冒北平市军事管制委员会名义溜到我家，用手枪逼着我的胸口要黄金。没有结果。就用布塞住我的嘴，绑住我的双脚，用麻绳把我勒死过去八次。直到第二天早上五点钟，两个匪徒才拿了我的自行车、手表、金戒指和许多衣服扬长而去。像王匪这样罪大恶极的反革命分子，人民政府必须严厉惩办，才能给我和以前在河北省河间一带被他杀害的四百多个同胞报仇。
    特务史玉龄带领还乡团  杀死革命干部四十多人
    京郊门头沟外十三区桥户营村农民王占龙说：史玉龄是有名的特务恶霸。在日寇统治时期，他用一百六十元伪币换了我一百六十块大洋。一九四四年，我们那一带获得解放，实行减租减息，我向史匪讨还这笔旧账，要回了三亩地。以后史匪偷偷地跑到北平，勾结反动地主刘鸿瑞组织还乡团。一九四六年我们这一带被蒋匪军重占，史匪带着还乡团回来，奸淫烧杀，无恶不作，被他们杀死后扔在黄土坑的革命干部就有四十多人。我被匪徒抓去，挨了无数次毒打，被灌了五壶凉水，死去活来好几次。我老婆那时快要生孩子，被史匪恶狠狠地踢了一脚，结果孩子生下来就死了。荣誉军人李忠和叶剑英将军的通讯员老彭，都是被史匪活埋的。有一次，史匪带着一伙匪徒到长辛店去，拦劫了人民解放军的十辆运输车，还枪杀了三个干部。若是加上日伪时期被史匪欺压致死的三个老乡，他一共杀害了九条人命。解放后，史匪被人民政府逮捕了，但是人民政府只判了他十五年徒刑。我们全村二十九户都要求要活剥他的皮。
    冷少颖制造“四九”血案  毒打师大学生逮捕教授
    北京师范大学教授徐英超说：一九四八年，在中统特务华北办事处情报组长兼学运组长冷少颖的主持下，师范大学发生了“四九”血案，我目睹匪徒们毒打学生的暴行，看见满屋满地的鲜血，我曾激愤地发动教授们向反动政府请愿。因此，和特务结下了仇恨。有天晚上，十几个特务围住了我的宿舍，四支手枪前后左右地对着我，甚至我的孩子也被他们用枪指着。我被抓去以后，特务硬说我是民主同盟的盟员，逼着我交出名单和电台等物。我不是民主同盟的，有什么名单可交。特务们就严刑拷打我，压杠子，灌凉水。我先后晕死过去六次。醒来的时候，我发现自己睡在一间四壁通风的屋子的地上，腿已经不能动了。第二天又有一个叫“人厨子”的特务继续审问我，他们把我的双手反绑，吊在梁上，然后两个宪兵用脚踢我，并用烧红了的铁烙我，烙得我浑身上下满是伤痕。特务匪徒的手段是多么毒辣和残忍啊！我在师范大学二十多年，全校师生都知道我老老实实教书，从不过问政治，但想不到也居然遭到了特务这样的毒手。今天我要求人民政府枪毙这些十恶不赦的匪徒，坚决执行镇压反革命的政策。像这样罪大恶极的反革命分子，有多少就要杀多少，一点也不要留情。因为不这样作，善良的老百姓就要继续受到他们的残害。
   “宁错杀一百不放走一个”  陈子丹死心塌地反对人民
    河北高中学生刘鹏志说：一九四八年，师范大学“四九”血案发生不久，一天晚上，许多特务拿着手枪、手榴弹、木棍、铁棒，还有日本兵用的大战刀，突然冲进我们学校的礼堂。正在举行联欢大会的全校师生立刻乱成一团，我被几个特务围了起来。有个叫陈子丹的特务照着我的头上就是一刀，鲜血立刻染满了我全身，湿透了衣服。我刚一回头，又被打了一棍，三个牙齿被打碎，头上也打开了两道口。我当时就昏过去了。第二天我和十五个同学被送到伪河北省保安司令部特务连，在那里被关了三个半月，又被送到国民党炮局的监狱，又关了三个月。特务拷打我们的残酷情形，真是难以令人想像。有个叫傅宗舜的同学，特务让他站在砖上，举着双手，不许喝水，一直站了七十二小时。到第三天时，傅宗舜实在支持不住了，双眼一闭倒了下去，特务们却又用浸湿了的粗麻绳去毒打他。就这样，傅宗舜同学的半个身体的神经受了损害，直到现在尚未恢复。今天我们在这里控诉特务的罪行，我还很清楚地记得特务陈子丹对我说过的话：“全国有很多高中学生，杀死你们十六个人，算得了什么。我们错杀一百人，也不能放走一个共产党。”特务匪徒是多么狠毒！但是今天他们终于落到人民的手里，亲手毒打过我的特务陈子丹也将受到人民的制裁，我心里非常高兴。
    电车公司工人王玉忠控诉蒋匪中统特务马振源惨害他的罪行。他说：“一九四七年三月二十四日，马振源捕去我们二十七个工人，硬说我们是共产党，百般拷打我们。马振源用竹签子刺入我的指缝，用子弹尖划工人季文田的肋骨，用杠子压得工人李子权晕过去好几次，直到现在他的腿上还带着伤痕。”这时，残害工人的凶手马振源被押到会场上全场代表表现了最大的激愤，王玉忠激动地指着马匪说：“就是这个王八蛋！就是他把我们二十七个人捉起来，想在蒋介石面前买好，当伪国大代表。”他说到这里，气得脸色都变了。南郊石家村的居民苏德平一家三口来控诉王凤巢的罪行。苏德平控诉说：“我家在十年内被王凤巢抢劫了三次，害得我全家无衣无食。第一次把我女儿抢走，我花了很多钱把她赎回来。第二次又把我老婆和女儿架走，我倾家荡产把她们赎回来。第三次王凤巢又把我母亲抢走一直没有音信。直到前些天，人民政府才在王凤巢家里一个两丈深的坑里发现了我母亲的尸首，脖子上还绑着绳子。我要求政府枪毙他，给我死去的母亲报仇！”
    长辛店第五区的尚老太太颤巍巍地走到台上，指着站在台角的特务分子李铁宝痛骂：“我儿子尚德祥的命送在你手里！那年他挑了一担盐，就被你看在眼里。盐担子给挑走，人也逮走，你丧尽了良心，用铁镐把我儿子劈了。被你劈了的人还不知有多少？！”老太太痛哭得讲不下去，被人从台上扶了下来。
    北郊农民范忠控诉中统特务、恶霸兼惯匪路焕仲、路焕山兄弟二人的罪行，他说：“我父亲是被他们兄弟两个用火筷子治死的。家里出不起一千斤老玉米收尸钱，可怜我父亲的尸首也被野狗拖吃了。附近三村有七条人命送在这两个家伙的手里。他们在村里还强奸了十来个妇女。还有一次就暗害了十几个八路军的采买员。北郊老百姓恨不得把他们兄弟两个剁成肉酱！”
    人民印刷厂工人王发、温永久控诉外号“南霸天”、“活阎王”的特务流氓兼一贯道坛主王廷枢的罪行。他逮捕杀害革命工作人员四十多名，光人民印刷厂工人就死在他手里十几个。温永久的弟弟就是被他治死的。被他弄得家败人亡的有十几户。王发的父亲活活地被他气死。“把他拉到南郊去枪毙！”王发喊出了南郊人民的声音。
    参加一九四七年“五·二○”学生运动，在西单遭特务围打的北京大学学生邓霄，悲愤地叙说着当时特务逞凶、以铁棒，有刺的“中正棍”追打手无寸铁的学生的情形。他高叫着：“现在有人民政府给我们作主，坚决惩办这些危害人民的反革命分子！”
    在会上控诉反革命分子罪行的，还有师范大学毕业生邱锡恩和前朝阳大学学生贺建章等，控诉时，到会的代表及各机关、团体列席人士五千多人纷纷高呼：“血债血还！”“为受害人民复仇！”“要求政府坚决镇压反革命！”被押解到台前的反革命分子王凤巢、王廷枢、冷少颖等反革命分子一个个面无人色。无数愤怒的眼睛，巨大的控诉和示威的吼声，使得这些反革命罪犯低下头来，等候着人民的最后宣判。
