Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 20th: General Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, on March 17th, congratulating the second anniversary of the signing of the Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Mutual Assistance Agreement. The telegram is as follows:

Respected Marshal Stalin:

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between Korea and the Soviet Union, I, on behalf of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people, and in my own name, extend my deep respect and infinite gratitude to the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the liberator and closest friend of the Korean people, our respected you.

The Korean people are welcoming the second anniversary of the signing of this agreement, which laid the foundation for the development of the Korean national economy and culture, in the midst of the fierce struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys. The Korean People's Army is engaged in a heroic struggle against the most ferocious and cunning enemy armed with tanks and airplanes. The People's Army has overcome many difficulties and is selflessly fighting to defend every inch of Korean territory. The Korean people have fresh memories of the enslavement by the Japanese imperialists, and today they absolutely do not want to be slaves of the so-called "civilized master" American imperialists. We believe that no difficulties and sacrifices can stop the glorious struggle of the Korean people for freedom and independence. The Korean people and their army, with the fraternal support of the peace-loving people of the world headed by the great Soviet people, are full of the firm determination to carry the war of liberation to the end.

Long live the great friendship and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and Korea!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of progressive humanity!

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, March 17th
