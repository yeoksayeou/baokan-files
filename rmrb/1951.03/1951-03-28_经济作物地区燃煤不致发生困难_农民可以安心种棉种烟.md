Response to Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

　　No Fuel Difficulties in Economic Crop Areas; Farmers Can Confidently Plant Cotton and Tobacco
    To the Editors:
    We sincerely accept the suggestion made by Comrade Wang Fushan in the "Readers' Letters" section of your newspaper on March 21st, regarding the lack of fuel in the cotton-producing area of Ding County, Hebei, and his suggestion that our company should resolve this issue. We would like to briefly respond below regarding the reasons for the fuel shortage in the Ding County area and the solutions being implemented:
    After the Mentougou Coal Mine reduced production last year due to flooding, the supply of anthracite coal in Beijing and Tianjin was insufficient. To ensure the coal supply for the capital, our company specially transferred large quantities of coal from Yangquan and Jiaozuo to the north. As a result, the coal reserves near Shijiazhuang and Ding County were not abundant, leading to a supply-demand imbalance. This has now been resolved through joint negotiations with the Hebei Provincial People's Government. In 1951, one of the main tasks of our company is to ensure the coal supply for large and medium-sized cities and economic crop areas (cotton and tobacco producing areas). Similar situations should not occur in the future, and cotton farmers in various regions can confidently plant cotton.

　　经济作物地区燃煤不致发生困难
    农民可以安心种棉种烟编辑同志：
    贵报三月二十一日“读者来信专页”，刊登王福山同志提出河北定县产棉区一带缺乏燃料，建议我公司予以解决的意见，我们愿意诚恳接受。并将定县一带缺乏燃料的原因及解决的情形，简略答复于下：
    去年门头沟煤矿因遭水淹减产后，北京、天津一带无烟煤供应不足，本公司为保证首都用煤，特将阳泉、焦作煤大量北调。因此，石家庄、定县附近一带存煤不丰，致发生供求失调现象。后经与河北省人民政府共同洽办，已获解决。我公司一九五一年即以保证大中城市及经济作物地区（棉、烟产区）用煤为主要任务之一。今后当不致发生类似情况，各地棉农可以安心栽种棉花。
