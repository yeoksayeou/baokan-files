The State Council has taken action regarding the Lianhuasi Quarry incident of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, where contractors damaged farmers' crops and severely exploited workers. This action follows a thorough investigation based on a report from the Central People's Supervisory Committee. This newspaper previously published criticisms of the incident's events and the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau's inadequate acceptance of criticism on June 14th and August 26th of last year. The Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau's letter accepting criticism and conducting a further review was also published in this newspaper on October 12th of last year. The Central People's Government State Council's People's Supervisory Committee, therefore, separately requested the Ministry of Railways and the Northwest People's Supervisory Committee to send personnel for a thorough investigation. Now, the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau has compensated farmers for their losses, settled accounts with the contractors, organized workers to elect their own group leaders, self-manage their meals, and established a production pact. The Deputy Director of the bureau, Wang Zhiheng, and the Propaganda Minister of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, Qin Ying, have both made self-criticisms at mass meetings of farmers and workers, and apologized to the farmers and workers. The most heinous contractors, group leaders Li Qiang, Zhao Rongguang, Miao Desheng, Shi Jinsheng, and others, have been handed over to the Huaxian People's Government for legal action. The bureau has also dispatched capable cadres and formed a joint office with units such as the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, the Northwest Labor Department, and the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, determined to completely eliminate feudal exploitation. The bureau reviewed the main reason why the incident was not resolved for a long time: the lack of a perspective relying on the masses of workers. It has resolved to change its style in the future and actively safeguard the interests of workers. The above situation has been reported by the Ministry of Railways and the Northwest Supervisory Committee to the Central People's Government Supervisory Committee for forwarding to the State Council. The State Council, considering that the acting director of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, Yuan Boyang, and the political commissar, Yang Shusheng, were still able to make profound self-criticisms, humbly accept criticism, and that the final handling of the incident was still appropriate, decided to give them a lenient warning; the remaining relevant personnel will be appropriately punished by the Zhengzhou Railway Administration under the instruction of the Ministry of Railways, depending on the severity of their involvement; as for the contractors who cruelly exploited the workers, they will be dealt with appropriately by the Xi'an Municipal People's Government.

　　政务院处理莲花寺石场事件
    西安铁路分局深刻检讨决心依靠工人维护工人利益
    西安铁路分局莲花寺石场包商毁坏农民青苗、严重剥削工人事件，政务院已根据中央人民监察委员会转报彻查情形，予以处理。该事件经过及西安铁路分局接受批评不够严肃等情形，本报在去年六月十四日、八月二十六日曾先后提出批评。西安铁路分局接受批评、进行再度检查的来信，亦经本报于去年十月十二日刊登。中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会，为此曾分别函请铁道部及西北人民监察委员会派员彻查。现在西安铁路分局已赔偿农民损失，向包商清算账目，并组织工人自选小组长，自管伙食，订立了生产公约。该局副局长王志恒和郑州铁路局宣传部长秦瀛在农民群众大会、工人大会上都作了检讨，并向农民、工人道歉。罪大恶极的包商大组长李强、赵荣光、苗德胜、师金声等，已交华县人民政府法办。该局并已派出有力干部与中共中央西北局、西北劳动部、西北总工会等单位组成了联合办公室，决心彻底消灭封建剥削。该局检讨了事件久不解决的主要原因，是没有依靠工人群众的观点，并决心在今后改变作风，积极维护工人利益。以上情形，已由铁道部、西北监察委员会报中央人民政府监察委员会转报政务院。政务院以西安铁路分局代理局长袁伯扬、政治委员杨树生尚能深刻检讨，虚心接受批评，最后对事件的处理亦尚适当，决定从轻予以警告处分；其余有关人员由铁道部饬由郑州铁路管理局负责按情节轻重予以适当处分；至于残酷剥削工人之包商，则由西安市人民政府酌情处理。
