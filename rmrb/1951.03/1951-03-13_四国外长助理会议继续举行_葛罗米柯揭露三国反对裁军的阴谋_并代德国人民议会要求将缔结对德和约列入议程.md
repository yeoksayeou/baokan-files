Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 11th - According to TASS, the Fourth Assistant Foreign Ministers' Meeting held its fifth session on the 9th, chaired by the French representative, Parrot.

At the meeting, Parrot and the British representative, Davies, routinely repeated their long-bankrupt old "arguments," using the excuse that they could not agree with the "wording" and "phrasing" of the Soviet proposal for the agenda to mask their actual fear of discussing issues such as the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and preventing the re-militarization of Germany, the four countries' reduction of armaments, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the withdrawal of occupying forces in accordance with the treaty at the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The Soviet representative, Gromyko, then stated that the Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the four countries' implementation of the Potsdam Agreement. This issue is of great importance to improving the situation in Europe and maintaining international peace. But now Davies is proposing to replace this issue with the level of troops, and is stubbornly describing all measures to re-militarize Germany and join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc as "defensive" measures. Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet delegation cannot consider any agenda that does not include the above issues as satisfactory.

Gromyko further pointed out that the representatives of the Western countries are stubbornly opposing the inclusion of the issue of reducing the four countries' armies in the agenda. The American representative, Jessup, tried to make people feel that the Soviet Union only suggested considering the reduction of the armies of the United States, Britain, and France, without touching the Soviet army; but this is completely unfounded. This argument is merely to deceive public opinion.

Gromyko read a statement from the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic requesting that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany this year be included in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to the four governments. He accused the United States, Britain, and France of rejecting the Soviet proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, which not only runs counter to strengthening peace in Europe, but also violates the interests of the German people. Finally, Gromyko requested the three countries' representatives to express their opinions on the wording of the second item of the revised Soviet agenda, which was revised to read: On the issue of restoring Germany's unity, accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and withdrawing the occupying forces from Germany in accordance with this treaty.

The next meeting is scheduled for the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 11th - The Fourth Assistant Foreign Ministers' Meeting continued on March 10th, chaired by the British representative, Davies.

The American representative, Jessup, spoke first. He stubbornly said that adopting the agenda proposed by the Soviet delegation "would mean adopting the Soviet point of view." He stubbornly opposed including issues such as the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and preventing the re-militarization of Germany, the four countries' reduction of armaments, the restoration of Germany's unity, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the withdrawal of occupying forces in accordance with the treaty in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. At the same time, he reiterated that he disagreed with including the issue of reducing the four countries' armaments in the agenda, and he did not conceal the United States' intention to continue expanding its military. This exposed the true face of the United States' determination to prepare for a new war in violation of the people's interests. The French representative, Parrot, had to vaguely admit in his speech that the first item of the U.S., British, and French proposal regarding the so-called review of the causes of tension in the European international situation was empty and abstract, and proposed some vague revisions and supplements to this item. He also opposed discussing the issue of reducing armaments at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The British representative, Davies, who spoke next, argued sophistically that the supplemented first item of the three countries' proposal had "included" the Soviet proposals.

The Soviet representative, Gromyko, pointed out that the new wording of the first item of the three countries' proposal was actually an attempt to replace the first and third items of the Soviet draft agenda, namely, the items on eliminating German militarism, preventing the re-militarization of Germany, and improving the situation in Europe and the four countries' disarmament. People cannot agree with this attempt to "include" the Soviet proposals without a trace.

The next meeting is scheduled for March 12th.

### 四国外长助理会议继续举行  葛罗米柯揭露三国反对裁军的阴谋  并代德国人民议会要求将缔结对德和约列入议程

　　四国外长助理会议继续举行
    葛罗米柯揭露三国反对裁军的阴谋
    并代德国人民议会要求将缔结对德和约列入议程
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：四国外长助理会议于九日举行第五次会议，由法国代表巴罗第任主席。
    巴罗第和英国代表戴维斯在会上照例重复他们早已破产了的老“论据”，借口不能同意苏联建议的议程的“提法”和“措辞”，以掩饰他们实际上害怕在外长会议中讨论关于履行肃清德国军国主义、防止德国重新军国主义化的波茨坦协定的问题和四国裁减军备、缔结对德和约并依照和约撤退占领军等问题。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯随后发言称：苏联一直非常重视四国履行波茨坦协定的问题。这个问题对于改善欧洲局势和维持国际和平有极大重要性。但现在戴维斯竟提议用关于军队的水平问题来代替这个问题，并硬把使德国重新军国主义化并加入北大西洋侵略集团的一切措施说成是“防御”措施。葛罗米柯着重指出：任何不包括上述问题的议程，苏联代表团都不能认为满意。
    葛罗米柯进一步指出：西方国家的代表们正顽固地反对把裁减四国军队的问题列入议程中。美国代表耶塞普力图使人们觉得苏联只建议考虑裁减美、英、法三国的军队，而不动苏联的军队；但这是完全没有根据的。这种论断，不过是为了欺骗舆论而已。
    葛罗米柯宣读了德意志民主共和国人民议会主席团要求把在今年缔结对德和约一事列入外长会议议程致四国政府的声明。他指责美、英、法三国拒绝苏联要求从速缔结对德和约的建议不仅与加强欧洲和平背道而驰，而且违反了德国人民的利益。葛罗米柯最后并要求三国代表对修改后的苏联议程第二项的措辞表示意见，该项议程修改后的措辞为：关于恢复德国统一、加速缔结对德和约以及遵照这个和约从德国撤退占领军的问题。
    下次会议定于十日举行。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：四国外长助理会议于三月十日继续开会，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。
    美国代表耶塞普首先发言。他硬说采取了苏联代表团所提出的议程“就意味着采取了苏联的观点”。他执拗地反对把关于履行肃清德国军国主义、防止德国重新军国主义化的波茨坦协定的问题和四国裁减军备、恢复德国的统一、缔结对德和约并按照和约撤退占领军等问题列入外长会议议程。同时，他再度声明不同意把裁减四国军备的问题列入议程，他毫不隐讳美国打算继续扩军。这就暴露了美国决心违反人民利益而准备新战争的真面目。法国代表巴罗第在发言中不得不隐隐地承认，关于所谓审议欧洲国际局势紧张的原因的美、英、法三国建议第一项议案是空洞而抽象的，并对这一项议案提出了一些意义不明的修改与补充。他也反对在外长会议中谈裁减军备的问题。继起发言的英国代表戴维斯强辞夺理地说：补充后的三国建议第一项议案已“包括”了苏联的建议。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯指出：三国建议第一项议案的新措辞实际上是企图代替苏联议程草案中第一项与第三项议案，即关于肃清德国军国主义、防止德国重新军国主义化以及改善欧洲局势和四国裁军等议案的。人们不能同意这种把苏联的建议“包括”得无影无踪的企图。
    下次会议定于三月十二日举行。
