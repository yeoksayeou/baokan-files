　　My Fellow Overseas Chinese in Thailand and the Thai People
    Protest the Thai Government's Persecution of Quan Min Bao
    The illegal arrest of Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong, responsible persons of Quan Min Bao here, and the conspiracy for further large-scale persecution of overseas Chinese in Thailand by the reactionary Thai government, increasingly and clearly expose that it is being carried out under the direct command of American imperialism. After the incident occurred, the Director-General of Police of the reactionary Thai government, Luan Cha, issued a statement saying: "If the authorities do not resolutely implement this measure, it will not be possible to obtain so much military aid from the United States at present." These lackeys of American imperialism completely obey the instructions of their American masters, and they shamelessly admit that today's Thailand is no longer able to survive independently as it did in the past, and that it has firmly leaned towards the group headed by the United States.
    The Cai-Wu incident has made the Chinese and Thai people clearly recognize the true face of the reactionary Thai government. Our approximately three million overseas Chinese in Thailand and the local people are all extremely angry and extremely concerned. Workers in various industries, hawkers, students, housewives, Thai youths, and even Thai active-duty soldiers have sent letters to the Quan Min Bao and the Immigration Bureau to express their sincere condolences to Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong, who were illegally detained. Representatives of the victims of the Huangqiao compost fire area and representatives of the rice mill workers in Thonburi were the first to bring goods and flowers to the Immigration Bureau to visit Cai and Wu. Old ladies also brought apples and went to express their condolences in turn. The righteous actions of Quan Min Bao have won the widespread support of the Chinese and Thai people.
    The overseas Chinese unanimously believe: "This unreasonable measure by the Thai government is not only related to the fate of two people, but also to the fate of the vast number of overseas Chinese." In their letter of condolence, the dockworkers indignantly stated: "We worker brothers want to support Quan Min Bao from the unreasonable persecution it has suffered, and resolutely support Cai and Wu."
    Now the wave of support for Quan Min Bao has resounded throughout various parts of the Thai interior. Chinese and Thai people in North Standard, Suphan and other places have sent letters of protest or condolence. In a letter signed by Ding Wushi and others, it said: "Workers who serve the masses are accused of crimes, then the broad masses may also be guilty!" They also rebuked the Thai government, saying: "This kind of disposal is a violation of human rights."
    Elementary school students have associated this with the pain of closed schools and loss of schooling, so they are extremely hostile to the Thai government's barbaric actions. Elementary school student Fang Shiyuan and others said in a letter to Quan Min Bao: "Thousands of our children have suffered unreasonable harm. We are out of school, wandering the streets... Today, the authorities are intensifying their persecution of our overseas Chinese, which is becoming increasingly serious." The letter also said: "We are growing up day by day, and one day we will settle accounts with the evil reactionary rulers."
    The Thai letters of condolence written by Thai youths further demonstrate the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Thai people. They earnestly stated: "We – the peace-loving Thai people, are willing to firmly stand by your side and resolutely oppose this unfair action." They clearly pointed out that this action by the Thai government "violates the provisions of the United Nations Charter on human rights... and is not what the Thai people need. This is a most despicable action." They further stated: "We will always unite and cooperate with you to fight against injustice and our common enemy – American imperialism and its servants, and achieve final victory."
    Now Quan Min Bao and all of us overseas Chinese and the Thai people are adhering to a just struggle. We must further unite and fight to the end for our own legitimate rights and interests!

### 我旅泰侨胞与泰国人民  抗议泰政府迫害全民报

　　我旅泰侨胞与泰国人民
    抗议泰政府迫害全民报
    泰国反动政府非法逮捕此间全民报负责人蔡志宏吴建中与阴谋进一步大规模迫害旅泰华侨的事件，日益清楚地暴露出它是在美国帝国主义的直接指挥下进行的。事件发生后，泰国反动政府的警察总监銮察即发表谈话说：“如果当局不坚决执行这一措施，目下也不能获得这么多的美援军火的。”这帮美帝国主义的奴仆们，完全听命于美国主子的指使，他们毫不顾羞耻地承认：今日的泰国已非如昔日般的单独生存，它已坚决投靠于以美国为首的集团了。
    蔡吴事件的发生，更使中、泰人民清楚地认识了泰国反动政府的真面目。我们约三百万旅泰华侨以及当地人民，无不万分愤怒与极端关切。各业工人、小贩、学生、家庭妇女、泰国青年、甚至泰国现役兵士等，均纷纷致函全民报社及移民局向被非法扣押的蔡志宏及吴建中两人致以亲切的慰问。黄桥土粪堆火灾区的灾民代表和吞府的火砻工人代表最先带了物品和鲜花，去移民局探视蔡吴二君。老太太们也拿着苹果挨着次序前去慰问。全民报的正义行动已获得了广大的中、泰人民的声援和支持。
    侨胞们一致认为：“泰国政府这个不合理的措施并不是仅仅关系到两个人的命运，而是关系到广大侨胞的命运的。”航业工友在慰问信中愤慨地表示：“我们工人兄弟要声援全民报所遭受的不合理的迫害，坚决支持蔡吴二君。”
    现在支援全民报的声浪，已响彻泰国内地各埠。北标、素攀等地的中泰人民都驰函抗议或慰问。在丁乌士等签名的信中说：“为群众服务的工作者，竟被指为犯罪，那么广大群众或许亦会同样有罪吧！”他们还斥责泰国政府说：“这种处置，实是侵犯人权。”
    小学生们由此而联想到封闭学校失学的痛苦，因此他们对于泰国政府的野蛮行动，更是极端仇视。小学生方世远等在写给全民报的信中说：“我们千万个孩子，曾遭受无理的残害。我们失学、流浪街头……今天当局对我们侨胞加紧迫逼，已日见厉害。”信中又说：“我们一天天在长大，总有一天要向万恶的反动统治者算账。”
    泰国青年所写的泰文慰问信中，更表明了牢不可破的中泰人民的友谊。他们恳切地表示：“我们——爱好和平的泰国人民，愿意坚决站在你们的一边，彻底反对这种不公平的行动。”他们明确地指出，泰国政府这种行动是“违反了联合国宪章关于人权的规定的………并不是泰国人所需要的。这是一种最卑鄙的行动。”他们更进一步表示：“我们始终与你们团结合作来对抗不公平和我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义和它的仆从，取得最后的胜利。”
    现在全民报和我们全体华侨以及泰国人民，正坚持着正义的斗争。我们更要进一步的团结，为了我们自己的正当权益而斗争到底！
