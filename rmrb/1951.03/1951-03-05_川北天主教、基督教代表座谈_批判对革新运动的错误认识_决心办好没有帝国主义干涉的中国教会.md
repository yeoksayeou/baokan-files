Sichuan North Catholic and Christian Representatives Hold Symposium
    Criticizing Erroneous Understandings of the Reform Movement
    Determined to Run Chinese Churches Well Without Imperialist Interference
    Representatives from seventy-one Catholic and Christian church organizations in the Sichuan North Region held an anti-America, aid-Korea, self-reliance, and reform symposium in Nanchong City from February 2nd to 9th. Attendees included Wang Wencheng, Bishop of the Nanchong National Catholic Diocese; Zhou Zuomin, Vicar General of Dazhou; Wang Liangzuo, Priest of Guangyuan Catholic Church; Chen Jing'an, Priest of Santai Catholic Church; Cai Fuchu, Bishop of the East Sichuan Diocese of the Chinese Holy Catholic Church; He Huiyuan, District Head and Pastor of Suining, and other representatives, totaling seventy-one people. At the symposium, the representatives exposed the criminal facts of imperialism using the church to carry out aggression. The meeting discussed and passed a reform declaration, implementation measures for the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation movement, a patriotic pact, and a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The representatives unanimously expressed that they would bring the spirit of the symposium back to their respective regions, convey it to every believer, carry out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement to the end, and were determined to run a Chinese church without imperialist interference.

    The declaration passed by the symposium stated: Since the launch of the reform movement in the Sichuan North Region, many believers still have some undue concerns, or their understanding of this movement is not clear enough. They think that missionaries sent by imperialist countries are “good people” who run churches, schools, and charitable undertakings, which, as the American imperialist Austin said, is a kind of “friendship” and “favor.” Therefore, they believe that severing relations with them and opposing them is almost an act of xenophobia. Some even think that self-reliance and reform is an act of “schism.” At this symposium, representatives from various regions exposed the facts of imperialism using the church to carry out cultural aggression and espionage activities. For example, British missionary Mi Huai’ren reported the shipping situation on the upper reaches of the Jialing River to the former British consulate; American missionaries Ke Yide and Su Xuezhen of the Suining Church secretly hid radio stations; two years ago, American pastor Zhuo Weixuan of Chengdu sent a group of Chinese youth students aged sixteen to twenty with high school education to the United States to learn radio technology; the local British doctor Lu Huadi measured and filled out wind direction and climate tables every day; in the seminary run by French people in Chengdu, Chinese people were not allowed to read Chinese books, and Chinese students had to tear Chinese books into single pages and secretly read them in the toilet. Dr. Du Shunfu, who studied in the United Kingdom, said: British missionaries had to undergo more than a year of special training before coming to China, and the graduation certificate was printed with the words "Serving the King." These facts show that the missionaries sent by imperialist countries all have political purposes. They use the church as a sugar coating and as a shield for carrying out aggressive conspiracies; they are evil spirits disguised as sheep, hiding jackals inside. They injected terrible ideological toxins into the Chinese people. Some Chinese people have been poisoned by this, and as a result, they worship and envy them in culture, thought, and material aspects, and even forget that they are Chinese, or resent being Chinese. This kind of invisible aggression is even more severe than their foreign guns and cannons. How can we one-sidedly only see the little favors of imperialist missionaries and not expose their vicious disguise?

    The declaration said: Catholicism has been introduced into China for more than 300 years; Christianity also has a history of more than 140 years. If these foreign missionaries really wanted to help the Chinese people establish their own churches, how could they continue to strengthen their control over the administrative and economic power of the Chinese church after more than 300 years or 140 years without any relaxation? Why do they send more missionaries and spend a lot of money to China to "preach"? Obviously, they have ulterior motives and purposes.

    The declaration said: The self-reliance and reform movement we are carrying out this time is to promote patriotism, arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of believers, eliminate the erroneous ideas of worshiping, envying, and fearing imperialism, especially American imperialism, resolutely sever all relations between the church and imperialist countries, and truly become a Chinese church of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. This is in line with the teachings and is the urgent requirement of all patriotic believers in China, and it is by no means an act of "schism." Our opposition to imperialism is not xenophobia. We believe that we must not confuse the use of the church by imperialism for aggressive conspiracy activities with the church itself, and we cannot tolerate activities that endanger the motherland in the church under the pretext of protecting religious freedom.

    The declaration finally called on every patriotic believer to unite closely in the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front led by Chairman Mao, establish a new Chinese church of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, defend the home and country, and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China!

　　川北天主教、基督教代表座谈
    批判对革新运动的错误认识
    决心办好没有帝国主义干涉的中国教会
    川北区天主教、基督教七十一个教会团体的代表，于二月二日至九日在南充市举行抗美援朝自立革新座谈会。到会代表有天主教南充国籍教区主教王文成、达县总铎周佐民、广元天主堂神父王良佐、三台天主堂神父陈静安、基督教中华圣公会东川教区会督蔡复初、遂宁教区长兼牧师何辉远等七十一人。座谈会上，代表们纷纷揭露了帝国主义利用教会进行侵略活动的罪恶事实。会上讨论和通过了革新宣言、自治自养自传运动实施办法、爱国公约和向毛主席致敬电。代表们一致表示要把座谈会的精神带回各个地区，传达给每一个教徒，把三自运动进行到底，决心办好一个没有帝国主义干涉的中国教会。
    座谈会通过发表的宣言说：我们川北区自展开革新运动以来，有不少信徒还存在着一些不应有的顾虑，或者对这个运动的认识还不够明确，以为帝国主义国家派来的传教士是办教会、办学校、办慈善事业的“好人”，正如美帝国主义分子奥斯汀所说的是一种“友谊”、“恩惠”，因此认为与他们断绝关系，反对他们，是近乎排外的行为。甚至有人认为自立革新是一种“裂教”行为。在这次座谈会上，来自各地的代表纷纷揭露了帝国主义利用教会进行文化侵略和间谍活动的事实。例如：英国传教士米怀仁替前英国领事馆查报嘉陵江上游的航运情形；遂宁教堂的美国传教士克依德、苏学贞等暗藏无线电台；二年前，成都美国教士卓伟选派一批十六岁至二十岁、具有高中文化程度的中国青年学生送到美国去学无线电技术；当地的英国医生陆化地天天测填风向气候表；成都法国人主办的修院里面，不许中国人读中国书，中国学生只好把中国书撕成单页，偷着在厕所里看。曾留学英国的医生杜顺福说：英国传教士在来中国以前，要受一年多的特别训练，毕业证书上印有“为国王服务”的字句。这些事实说明帝国主义国家派来的传教士都怀有政治目的，他们利用教会作糖衣，作进行侵略阴谋活动的护身符；他们是外面披着羊皮、里面藏着豺狼的恶鬼。他们给中国人注射了可怕的思想毒素。有一些中国人中了这种毒，于是在文化、思想、物质各方面都崇拜、羡慕他们，竟忘了自己是中国人，或者怨恨自己成为中国人。这种无形的侵略更胜过他们的洋枪洋炮。我们怎能片面地只看见帝国主义传教士的一点小恩小惠，竟不去拆穿他们恶毒的伪装呢？
    宣言说：天主教传入中国已有三百多年的历史；基督教也有一百四十多年的历史了。这些外国传教士果真为了帮助中国人建立自己的教会，岂有经过三百多年或一百四十多年之后，仍然继续并且加强把持中国教会的行政权、经济权而不肯丝毫放松呢？为什么他们要更多地增派传教士，开支大量的经费，到中国来“传教”呢？这显然有他们不可告人的企图和目的。
    宣言说：我们这次进行的自立革新运动，是为要提倡爱国主义，激起信徒的爱国热情，消除崇拜、羡慕和恐惧帝国主义尤其是美帝国主义的错误思想，坚决地使教会与帝国主义国家断绝一切关系，真正成为自治、自养、自传的中国教会，这是合乎教义也是全中国爱国信徒的迫切要求，决不是“裂教”行为。我们反对帝国主义，并不是排外。我们认为：决不能把帝国主义利用教会作侵略阴谋活动与教会本身混为一谈，不能因为保护宗教信仰自由而容忍那些危害祖国的活动在教会中存在。
    宣言最后号召每一个富有爱国热情的信徒紧密地团结在毛主席所领导的反帝爱国的统一战线中，建立起自治、自养、自传的新中国教会，以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国，为建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗到底！
