　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st: People in Europe and the United States continue to support the Spanish people's heroic struggle against the Franco regime.

　　The Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia, on behalf of more than three million members, expressed fraternal sympathy to the Spanish working people on the 17th, and expressed deep conviction that their cause would be victorious. The statement emphasized: "The general strike in Barcelona shows that the Spanish people have full determination to fight for human rights and freedom, and to fight for the independence of their country."

　　Students of Warsaw University in Poland held a mass meeting on the 17th to condemn the Franco regime's brutal suppression of the Spanish people. The meeting also resolved to write letters to the students of the University of Barcelona, which had been closed by Franco, to pay tribute to these students who are still persisting in the struggle and to cheer them.

　　The National Standing Committee of the French Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace specially passed a resolution on the 18th to pay tribute to the Spanish Republicans. Franco's brutal suppression of the Spanish people has aroused widespread anger among people of various persuasions in France. Many writers and journalists have jointly appealed to public opinion, expressing solidarity with the Spanish people and protesting against the Franco government. The Uruguayan General Confederation of Labor called on its affiliated trade unions to support the Spanish people and wrote to the Spanish Embassy to protest against Franco's atrocities. On the 16th, various democratic groups in Uruguay held a grand rally in Montevideo, the capital, to support the Spanish people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The general strike of 300,000 workers in Barcelona has shaken Franco's rule in Spain, exposing the fragility and instability of this fascist regime.

　　In view of the fact that the various bloody means adopted since the general strike still cannot subdue the angry tide of popular resistance, Franco hastily transferred Corunna on the 18th, who was notorious for the massacre of Oviedo miners in 1934, to the governor of Catalonia, and transferred Ielo to the chief of armed police in Barcelona, and appointed his capable henchman, Falangist Gaddaran, as chairman of the Catalonia Trade Union, attempting to maintain his dying rule with further high pressure. At present, hundreds of arrested striking workers are still imprisoned in Barcelona's prisons, and warships sent to suppress the strike are still docked in the port of Barcelona.

　　However, even Agence France-Presse's Barcelona dispatch could not but admit: Although "the authorities have taken all measures to prevent the re-emergence of strikes and demonstrations, the rising cost of living and food shortages that caused the strike have not been resolved." The incurable weakness of the Franco regime has greatly discouraged the American and British imperialist elements who are keen to conclude a war alliance with it. The conservative London "Observer" sadly admitted on the 18th that "it is now very clear that the Franco government can only continue to rule by force," and then cried out that the United States, Britain, and France can only "allow Spain to join the Western bloc and give Spain economic aid" if Franco can guarantee to strengthen its domestic rule, because "without this guarantee, giving aid to Spain... is a useless investment."

　　欧美人民纷纷集会、写信  声援西班牙人民斗争
    佛朗哥的统治日益脆弱不稳
    美英帝国主义分子大为丧气
    【新华社二十一日讯】欧美各国人民继续声援与佛朗哥政权英勇斗争的西班牙人民。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会于十七日代表三百余万会员对西班牙劳动人民表示兄弟的同情，并深信他们的事业必将获得胜利。声明着重指出：“巴塞罗那的总罢工，表明了西班牙人民具有充分的决心来争取人类的权利和自由，争取他们国家的独立。”
    波兰华沙大学的学生们于十七日举行了群众大会，谴责佛朗哥政权残暴镇压西班牙人民。会上并决议写信给已被佛朗哥封闭的巴塞罗那大学的学生，向这些仍在坚持斗争的学生们致敬。向他们欢呼万岁。
    法国争和平自由战士协会全国常设委员会十八日特通过决议，向西班牙共和分子致敬。佛朗哥对西班牙人民的残酷镇压，已在法国各种倾向的人士中激起了广泛的愤怒。好些作家和新闻记者联名向舆论界呼吁，表示与西班牙人民团结一致，并对佛朗哥政府发出抗议。乌拉圭总工会号召所属各工会声援西班牙人民，并致书西班牙大使馆，抗议佛朗哥的暴行。十六日，乌拉圭各民主团体在首都蒙得维的亚举行了声援西班牙人民的盛大集会。
    【新华社二十一日讯】巴塞罗那三十万工人的总罢工已动摇了佛朗哥在西班牙的统治，暴露了这个法西斯政权的脆弱与不稳。
    鉴于大罢工以来所采取的种种血腥手段仍然不能压服人民反抗的怒潮，佛朗哥在十八日慌忙地把因一九三四年屠杀奥维多矿工而臭名远扬的科伦加调任加泰罗尼亚省省长，把伊埃洛调任巴塞罗那武装警察总监，并任命其得力爪牙、长枪党的加达兰为加泰罗尼亚工会主席，企图以进一步的高压来维持其垂危的统治。现在，巴塞罗那的监狱中仍然囚禁着数百名被捕的罢工工人，开来镇压罢工的军舰仍然在巴塞罗那港内停泊。
    但是，甚至法新社巴塞罗那消息也不能不承认：虽然“当局已采取一切措施，以防止罢工和示威重新爆发，但是引起罢工的生活费用上涨和粮荒仍未解决。”佛朗哥政权这种不可救药的孱弱，已使热中于与它缔结战争同盟的美英帝国主义分子大为丧气，伦敦保守的《观察家》报在十八日黯然承认“现在已经很明白，佛朗哥政府只是靠武力才能继续当政”之后，大声哀号美、英、法三国只有在佛朗哥能保证加强其国内统治的情况下，“才能允许西班牙加入西方集团，才能给西班牙以经济援助”，因为，“如果没有这种保证，给西班牙以援助……就是一种无益的投资。”
