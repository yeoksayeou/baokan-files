Xinhua News Agency, March 19th dispatch from Chengdu: Wang Zimin, the main culprit in the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo five years ago in Kunming, and a Kuomintang secret agent, has been executed in Chengdu.

In 1946, the Kuomintang bandit gang, with executioner Huo Kuizhang as the bandit “Commander-in-Chief of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters,” and Wang Zimin as the bandit unit’s “Major General Director of the Kunming Investigation Office,” attempted to further suppress the democratic movement in Kunming. Between April and May of that year, Bandit Wang submitted a blacklist of more than forty people, including professors and students from various universities in Kunming and democratic figures from all walks of life, which was submitted to bandit Chiang Kai-shek by bandit Huo Kuizhang for designation for assassination or arrest. In July of the same year, Bandit Wang personally deployed his subordinates to form action teams, and on the 11th and 15th of the month, successively assassinated Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo with American-made silenced pistols. After 1947, Bandit Wang was transferred to the bandit “Deputy Commander of the Fourth District Security of Hubei Province” and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Hubei Province, Bandit Wang fled to Xindu, Sichuan, hiding under an assumed name, but was eventually captured by the public security organs of the Sichuan Western District People's Government and brought to justice.

The Chengdu People's Court convened a mass public trial attended by more than 38,000 people on January 10th of this year. At the meeting, Zhang Songtao, representative of the Chengdu Temporary Working Committee of the China Democratic League, denounced Bandit Wang's heinous crimes. At the unanimous request of the participants, the People's Court immediately sentenced Bandit Wang to death, and with the approval of the higher-level People's Government, the execution by shooting has been carried out.

　　暗杀李公朴闻一多的主犯
    王匪孑民在成都伏法
    【新华社十九日讯】成都消息：五年前在昆明暗杀李公朴和闻一多的主犯、国民党特务分子王孑民已在成都市伏法。
    一九四六年，国民党匪帮以刽子手霍揆彰任匪“云南省警备司令部总司令”，王匪孑民任该匪部“昆明稽查处少将处长”，企图进一步镇压昆明的民主运动。是年四、五月间，王匪提出了包括昆明各大学教授、学生及各界民主人士在内的四十余人的黑名单，经由霍匪揆彰交蒋匪介石圈定暗杀或逮捕。同年七月，王匪即亲自部署其下属组成行动小组，于十一、十五两日连续以美制无声手枪暗杀了李公朴和闻一多。一九四七年后，王匪调任匪“湖北省第四区保安副司令”，继续进行反革命活动。湖北省解放后，王匪逃至四川新都，化名潜伏，但终被我川西区人民政府公安机关捕获归案。
    成都市人民法庭于本年一月十日召开了三万八千余人参加的群众公审大会。会上，中国民主同盟成都市临时工作委员会代表张松涛控诉了王匪的万恶罪行。在与会群众的一致要求下，人民法庭当即判处王匪死刑，经上级人民政府批准，已执行枪决。
