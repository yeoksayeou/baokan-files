Business circles in East China are further launching a collective tax payment campaign, universally achieving on-time or early tax payment.

The collective tax payment campaign in the East China region was launched during the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and oppose the U.S. arming of Japan. For example, the collective tax payment campaign in Shanghai was actively promoted by industrial and commercial households in districts that suffered heavily from Japanese aggression and U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek air raids, such as Tilanqiao, Zhabei, Yangsi, and Xinjing. It quickly developed from a phased collective tax payment of around a thousand people at the beginning to a city-wide collective tax payment of nearly ten thousand people. By March 15, nearly 1,500 tax payment groups in the city had participated in the collective tax payment competition. After participating in various rallies denouncing the crimes of Japan and U.S. imperialism, industrial and commercial operators in five districts of Nanjing collectively prepaid their January business tax. In Xiamen, Lianjiang, Changle, Pingtan and other places in Fujian Province, business circles held collective tax payment parades. In towns and cities in the province that had previously had more instances of tax evasion and underreporting, the business turnover reported by the business circles in January and February this year was generally much higher than in the winter of last year. Under the slogan of "Not a Single Penny Owed," the business circles in Pingtan City paid off their January business tax within two hours.

In order to make the collective tax payment campaign a regular movement to ensure that national tax revenues are deposited into the treasury on schedule, business circles in East China have automatically formulated various specific methods for collective tax payment. Business circles in Shanghai are continuing to improve tax payment groups and promote collective tax declaration and payment, as well as mutual aid savings methods. Industrial and commercial operators in many districts have begun to collectively inspect the implementation of the Patriotic Pact and have submitted specific guarantees to the tax bureau by industry or group, in phases, to ensure collective tax payment forever in the future. In southern and northern Jiangsu, many cities' business circles have also established collective tax payment as a regular system. For example, the business circles in Qingpu County stipulate that the 5th of each month is Collective Tax Payment Day. The Suzhou business circles have specially established a Collective Tax Payment Committee to strengthen leadership over the collective tax payment movement.

    进一步展开集体纳税运动
    普遍做到按期或提前交纳税款
    华东各地工商界进一步展开集体交税运动，普遍做到按期或提前交纳税款。
    华东区的集体交税运动是在抗美援朝反对美国武装日本运动中展开的。如上海市的集体交税运动，由于遭受日寇蹂躏和美蒋飞机轰炸较重的提篮桥、闸北、杨思、新泾等区工商业户积极推动，便从开始时分段的千人左右的集体交税很快地发展到近万人的全区集体交税。至三月十五日止，全市已有近一千五百多个纳税小组参加了集体交税的竞赛。南京市的工商业者参加了各种控诉日本和美国帝国主义罪行的集会后，便有五个区的工商业户集体预交了一月份营业税。福建省厦门、连江、长乐、平潭等地的工商界举行了集体纳税游行。该省过去滞纳漏报现象较多的城镇，今年一月和二月工商界自报的营业额，也较去年冬季普遍增加很多。平潭城区的工商界在“无一尾欠”的口号下，两小时内就交清了一月份营业税。
    华东各地工商界为使集体交税运动成为经常的运动，以保证国家税收如期入库，自动订出了各种集体交税的具体办法。上海市工商界正继续健全纳税小组、推广集体报税交税与互助储金的办法。不少区的工商业户开始集体检查爱国公约的执行情况，并且分业或分组分段向税务局提出今后永远集体交税的具体保证。苏南、苏北也有不少城市的工商界将集体交税定为经常的制度，如青浦县工商界规定每月五日为集体纳税日。苏州市工商界特成立集体纳税委员会，以加强对集体纳税运动的领导。
