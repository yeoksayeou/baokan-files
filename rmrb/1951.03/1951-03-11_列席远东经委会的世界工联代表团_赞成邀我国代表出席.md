Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 8th – The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) attending the seventh session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in Lahore, Pakistan, submitted a written statement to the acting chairman of the conference, expressing full support for the Soviet Union's proposal to expel the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang and invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the conference.

The statement began by declaring: "The World Federation of Trade Unions is the true representative of the working class worldwide. Among the national trade union organizations affiliated with the WFTU is the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of the People's Republic of China – the largest and most powerful trade union group in the Asian region. Therefore, in this respect, the WFTU represents the interests, will, and determination of an important class of people in China. The WFTU believes it has an obligation to express its opinion on the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China."

The statement pointed out: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the Chinese people. The Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, eking out a living under the military protection of the United States, cannot represent the Chinese people and is nothing more than a group of criminals.

The statement emphasized: "Since this commission is an organization that studies the economies of Asia and the Far East, its members should include one of the most powerful countries in Asia – the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China has 475 million people, accounting for nearly half of the population in the region studied by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East; and possesses a quarter of the land in this region. If this commission excludes representatives of the People's Republic of China, it would mean that the commission would lose its representativeness and make it impossible for it to effectively carry out its work."

The statement concluded by requesting the commission to immediately pass the Soviet Union's proposal.

However, under the manipulation of the United States, the commission illegally rejected the legitimate proposal of the Soviet Union.

　　列席远东经委会的世界工联代表团
    赞成邀我国代表出席
    【新华社新德里八日电】列席在巴基斯坦拉合尔举行的联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第七次会议的世界工会联合会代表团，在苏联代表提出驱逐国民党残余匪帮的所谓代表并邀请中华人民共和国代表出席会议的议案后，向会议代理主席提出书面声明，表示完全支持苏联的提案。
    声明首先宣称：“世界工联是全世界工人阶级的真正代表。在世界工联所属的全国性工会组织中，有中华人民共和国的中华全国总工会——亚洲地区最大的和最强有力的工会团体。因此，在这方面，世界工联代表了中国一个重要阶层的人民的利益、意志和决心。世界工联认为它有义务在中华人民共和国的代表权问题上发表它的意见。”
    声明指出：中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法的政府。在美国的军事卵翼下苟延残喘的国民党残余匪帮不能代表中国人民，只不过是一群罪犯。
    声明着重指出：“这个委员会既然是一个研究亚洲和远东经济的组织，它的成员就应该包括亚洲最强大的国家之一——中华人民共和国在内。中华人民共和国拥有四亿七千五百万人民，几占亚洲暨远东经济委员会所研究的地区中人口之半数；并拥有这个地区的四分之一的土地。假如这个委员会排除中华人民共和国的代表，那就意味着委员会将失去它的代表性，并使它不可能有效地进行它的工作。”
    声明最后要求该委员会立即通过苏联的提案。
    但是，在美国的操纵下，该委员会竟非法地否决了苏联的正当提案。
