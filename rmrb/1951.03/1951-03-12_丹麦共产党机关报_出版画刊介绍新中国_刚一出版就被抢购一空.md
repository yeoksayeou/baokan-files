Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th: Copenhagen dispatch: In view of the Danish people's boundless concern for the People's Republic of China, the Danish Communist Party newspaper "Land og Folk" recently published a special illustrated supplement dedicated to introducing China. The newspaper's first illustrated magazine was published in 1949 to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday. The second illustrated magazine was printed in a unprecedented edition of 35,000 copies, but it sold out immediately upon publication. The entire magazine has sixteen pages, with a photo of Chairman Mao Zedong among the masses on the cover. In addition, a full page is printed in color with a map of China, the Chinese national flag, and the national emblem. Among the more than one hundred photos and woodcuts are various scenes of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the recent movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. There are also historically significant photos about the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's 25,000-li Long March, the founding of the People's Republic of China, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and Chinese representative Wu Xiuquan's activities at the United Nations, as well as paintings introducing the lives of the Chinese people, Chinese ethnic minorities, and Chinese industry and agriculture.
