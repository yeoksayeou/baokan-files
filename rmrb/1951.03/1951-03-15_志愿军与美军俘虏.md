　　The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and American POWs
       Chai Chuanruo
    (I)
    After the Battle of San So-ri (south of Kunuri), the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units continuously searched out batches of American officers and soldiers from deep in the mountains, forests, and crevices. Their faces were covered in dirt, their expressions haggard. Some had no shoes or hats, others had lost their clothes, and some had just crawled out of haystacks, covered in straw. The officers tore off their rank insignia and put on enlisted men's uniforms; the soldiers were sniffling and shivering. Added to this were three to five days of hunger, thirst, and cold, which had made them unrecognizable.
    Like the puppet soldiers of Li Chengwan, they were completely unfamiliar with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's policy on prisoners of war. They had been deceived by American imperialism into thinking that "becoming a prisoner means death." When our soldiers instructed them to move their positions, they were frightened and looked at each other in dismay. Some even stretched their necks, closed their eyes, and made a sorrowful pre-death posture; some simply sat on the ground and refused to move, indicating that "it's better to die here!" Only after we explained our policy on prisoners of war would they change this ridiculous attitude. However, we did not have enough translators, so the commanders and fighters often had to first make a "kill" gesture with their hands, and then wave their hands to indicate "no" to explain that we do not kill prisoners. Or they would give them their best dry rations to eat and boil water for them to wash their faces and quench their thirst, using practical actions to influence and educate them, so that they could understand our policy on prisoners of war. In this way, they would happily drive American-made cars on the highway for us.
    The Security Section of the Political Department of a certain regiment received two wounded American prisoners of war. One was wounded in the foot and could move slowly with a crutch; the other was wounded in the waist, had lost a lot of blood, and was lying on the kang, his face pale. His wound throbbed with pain, and he kept reaching out and shouting weakly, "Tan--bai..." (In Korean, cigarettes are called "Tanbai.")
    The young messenger knew that smoking could relieve pain, so he rolled dozens of cigarettes, handing them to him one after another, and carefully lighting them for him. Comrade Zhang Guangyu, the head of the Security Section, saw that this seriously wounded prisoner could not eat ordinary food, so he took his only two jin of health-care flour to make thin noodles and pancakes, which the messenger fed him, sometimes adding coffee and chocolate. This continued for three days.
    Now, the work of a certain regiment to take in wounded prisoners has been widely carried out. The Political Department of the regiment has also specially organized a reception team, led by Comrade Feng Shiyu, a security officer, with a detachment from the propaganda team, nine stretchers from the stretcher team, two nurses, two cooks, and one clerk. Obviously, this is already a small field hospital.
    On a mountain near the logistics department of a certain regiment, an American wounded soldier crawled down the mountain every day to secretly scout, wanting to see what kind of people these troops with great courage and skilled in the art of war were, and what they were doing here. When he was peeking, he was filled with fear and his nerves were very tense. However, for several days, what he saw were kind people wearing coarse cloth clothes and eating cornmeal mush. They carried grenades and automatic rifles just seized from the American army, and constantly husked rice, ground flour, fetched water, and swept the courtyard. When they had free time, they formed groups of three or five to hold group meetings. Other than that, he did not find anything terrible. He gradually became less afraid and wanted to muster the courage to go down the mountain to beg for food. But because of blood loss and thirst, he could only crawl on the ground, waiting to die. At this moment, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army appeared in front of him. He patted his stomach and held up four fingers, indicating that he had not eaten for four days. The soldiers of the Volunteer Army helped him onto a stretcher.
    Feng Shiyu's reception team successively took in nine wounded prisoners, including four blacks and five whites. Adding the original two, there were eleven in total. The nurses and cooks took care of these eleven wounded prisoners as if they were their own wounded soldiers. As the days passed, the prisoners often reached out and held the hands of the Volunteer Army soldiers tightly, unwilling to let go, expressing their gratitude.
    The troops were about to set off. This was a great march towards the 38th parallel, and all personnel had to participate in this great action. The regiment leaders sent Comrade Qiao Jun to deliver a farewell speech to the wounded prisoners. Because there was no English translator, Comrade Ma Xiaotang, the education officer who knew Japanese, translated the Chinese into Japanese, and then a Li Chengwan prisoner of war who knew both English and Japanese translated it into English. Comrade Qiao Jun began his speech in this temporary sickroom through two layers of translation:
    "Dear American brothers! We are the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, soldiers who defend our own country and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. We oppose the American imperialists' aggression against Korea and the Wall Street war-mongers' launching of new wars of aggression. The people of China and Korea will join hands with the peace-loving people of the world to crush any attack by American imperialism! But we do not oppose the American people. You have been deceived by the Wall Street war-mongers and driven to Korea to be cannon fodder. We, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sympathize with you and hope that you will wake up and oppose the common enemy of all mankind—the American imperialists..."
    These novel words stimulated the minds of the American prisoners of war one by one. This was the first time in their lives that they had heard such words. The doubts lingering in their minds began to be resolved. The seriously wounded also struggled to sit up, expressing their gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and expressing their determination to withdraw from the war. But when they heard that our army was about to advance, they felt the threat of death coming again. They were afraid of being killed, afraid of starving to death, freezing to death, and afraid of dying because their wounds were not treated. We then discussed the matter with the local people's government, and Comrade Qiao Jun, our army representative, and the village chief of Xincang Station jointly announced: First, ensure their safety; Second, guarantee that they would have food to eat and houses to live in; Third, try our best to request the People's Army and the follow-up troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to provide treatment on our behalf. In addition, the Volunteer Army also gave each wounded prisoner 300 Korean won as medical expenses.
    After the translator explained, the small temporary sickroom was boiling. Jack, a soldier of the U.S. Second Division who was released, shouted, "I understand, you are true peace fighters and true friends of the American people. When I return to my country, I will definitely tell the American people about your great deeds. We will jointly oppose the Wall Street war-mongers!"
    Vack, a nineteen-year-old young soldier, said angrily, "After my injury heals, I will definitely join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight this war-monger MacArthur!"
    Thomas, an old soldier who was seriously injured and lying under the cupboard, said, "I have been a soldier for eighteen years, traveled to more than twenty countries, and fought some battles, but I have never seen an army as capable of fighting as you, and I have never seen an army that treats prisoners of the enemy country like you. I will never forget you!" As he spoke, he struggled to reach out his hand and held the hand of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier tightly. Tears filled his eyes.
  (II)
    When the American imperialist aggressor troops were frantically advancing towards the Yalu River, and when the American soldiers did not yet understand the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's policy on prisoners of war, they were reluctant to surrender. This is why the number of killed and wounded was often more than three times the number of captured in our first few battles. However, based on a great revolutionary sense of justice, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army finally overcame various difficulties and increased the proportion of prisoners of war each time.
    In the Battle of Gunuri, our prisoner-of-war management brigade received 869 captured soldiers from the U.S. Second Division, Twenty-fifth Division, and First Cavalry Division. In addition to Americans, there were also Mexicans, Turks, and Filipinos. It was not easy for the soldiers to capture this group of enemy soldiers, but rather it was done after a serious battle. This group of soldiers was deceived by the American imperialists: "Fighting in Korea is implementing the United Nations resolution" and "Fight to the 38th parallel and go home for Christmas." Although the average soldier did not quite believe these deceptive propaganda, they were finally driven to Korea for the sake of $300 a month, serving as cannon fodder for the invaders.
    After more than a month of our patient education, they began to wake up.
    Walter Duncan (SFCW yat Duncon), Quartermaster Sergeant of the 2nd Engineer Battalion of the U.S. 2nd Division, said: "Before being captured, I didn't understand the character of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. Now I know: you are the bravest in battle and the kindest to prisoners."
    James H. Jackson (Pfc James H. Jackson), a private first class gunner of the 503rd Field Artillery Battalion of the 2nd Division, said: "We don't need war. Being captured this time saved our lives. After returning home, I will never participate in any war again."
    James Maywell (SFC James Maywell), the group leader of the 3rd Company of the battalion, said: "On the front line, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army officer used his own emergency kit to wrap our wounds, which I will never forget."
    When we asked who should be held responsible for this war, they all hated MacArthur and said in unison: "This war-monger MacArthur hides thousands of miles away and asks us to die for the capitalists. But he is drinking champagne and dancing in Japan. We hope you will catch this old guy as soon as possible and punish him."
    In the prisoner-of-war management brigade, there was a 72-person officer company, including three lieutenant colonels, seventeen majors, twenty-four captains, nineteen lieutenants, five second lieutenants, and four warrant officers. These officers were more confused than the average soldier, but they were more afraid of death than the average soldier.
    Clack Cumpbell, a lieutenant colonel and senior advisor to the 7th Division of the puppet 2nd Army Corps, was the most stubborn of these 72 officers. He laid down his weapon along with his six majors after a seven-minute hand-to-hand combat led by Comrade Wang Shiye, the heroic company commander of a certain Volunteer Army unit's 8th Company.
    The education of this group of officers was naturally more difficult. But justice and truth ultimately belong to the people, not to any reactionaries or any distorted fallacies. Now, after a month of study and inner struggle, Lieutenant Colonel Clark finally took the lead in expressing his previously unwilling but more truthful opinions.
    "I am very fortunate to be a prisoner of the Chinese army. I understand very well that the treatment we receive here is the best treatment you can achieve. We live in the same houses as you, eat the same food, and have not been subjected to any insults. I couldn't have imagined all of this before I was captured."
    Regarding the annihilation of the 7th Division of the puppet army, he said: "The reason for the failure of the puppet 7th Division is first that the morale of the puppet soldiers was low, and the relationship between officers at all levels was bad. But most importantly, your soldiers are brave in combat, have good individual training, are not afraid of cold, not afraid of hunger, are good at fighting alone and in mountainous areas, are good at night battles and close combat, and are good at flanking attacks and cutting off the rear. Your tactics are very superior. You lack airplanes and artillery, but you are able to defeat airplanes and artillery. I believe that with such superior mountain warfare tactics, you can defeat the enemy in any area."
  (III)
    After the "New Year Offensive" was launched, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army struck the American aggressor troops and Li Chengwan's bandit army with the force of a thunderbolt. In the past two battles, the Americans believed that there was "no fixed front" and "irregular fighting", otherwise they would not have been so embarrassed. This time, it was a regular battle on a fixed battlefield on the "38th parallel," but the result was that the American-Li bandit army was even more embarrassed, the four-hundred-mile-wide frontal defense system collapsed, and thousands of airplanes and thousands of artillery pieces lost their effectiveness. As the American aggressors admitted: "Under the bombardment of airplanes and artillery, those well-trained soldiers who only carried submachine guns and grenades still surged forward," "Even a volcanic eruption can't stop them!"
    After breaking through the "38th parallel," the vanguard troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army successively broke through three lines of defense of the enemy and advanced more than a hundred miles. None of the enemy's "depth deployments" could resist our army. As the Volunteer Army soldiers said: "The characteristics of the Americans are that they have many airplanes, many artillery pieces, many tanks, many cars, and they run fast."
    "Because the enemy ran fast and we chased closely, we didn't have time to set up a radio station within thirty hours." This was the report of the vanguard troops to the headquarters.
    In a day and night of pursuit, the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army climbed mountains and ridges, waded through icy rivers, built bridges, endured hunger and thirst, and overcame great difficulties, finally catching up with the fleeing American army near Su-rak Mountain north of Seoul and cutting off the retreat of thousands of Li-American bandits.
    An American soldier who was captured was deeply moved by our policy of giving preferential treatment to prisoners of war and volunteered to write a letter of persuasion to surrender:
    "American soldiers!
    This is written by a captured American soldier. I believe you will avoid unnecessary sacrifice if you surrender to them.
    They are the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and they treat me and other captured people very generously.
          First Cavalry Division  McDuffal
        January 1, 1951"
    Before this letter of persuasion was sent out, batches of American troops surrendered in another place. More than 200 people from the 19th Regiment of the U.S. 24th Division carried their guns on their backs, waved white flags, and lined up in orderly rows to surrender to us. Obviously, they were more orderly than when they were fleeing.
    Suddenly, rows of artillery and batches of airplanes fiercely bombarded and strafed this surrendered army, and machine guns also opened fire. This was the most vicious means. But the surrendering were very determined, and they risked their lives to break through the fire net. Except for the dead and wounded, 109 people reached the Volunteer Army's reception brigade.
    Among these 109 people, except for two Indians, one German, and one Italian (all of whom were overseas Chinese in the United States), the rest were Americans. They were all used as cannon fodder for the invaders under the threat of unemployment and the temptation of $300 a month. Now, under the severe blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they have completely lost their will to fight. Their common goal is only one, to save their own lives. Dang Li-gang, a lieutenant platoon leader of the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 19th Regiment of the U.S. 24th Division, surrendered and kissed his wife's letter, saying: "This is a letter from my lover wishing me well before Christmas. She is very worried about my safety. If she knew that I had come to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army side, she would definitely turn her sorrow into joy." Grace, a soldier from a working-class background, said happily: "I was arrested by the government on August 16th last year. I was initially unwilling, but the officials said '300 yuan a month, guaranteed no unemployment'. Now you are being asked to kill so many people every day, we all want life and don't want this 300 yuan."

　　志愿军与美军俘虏
       柴川若
    （一）
    三所里（军隅里南）战斗以后，中国人民志愿军各部，不断地从深山丛林和岩缝中，搜出成批的美军官兵。他们满面污垢，形容憔悴，有的没有鞋帽，有的丢了衣服，有的刚从草堆里钻出来，全身都是稻草。军官们撕掉了肩章，换上士兵服装；士兵们淌着鼻涕，打着哆嗦。加上三五天的饥渴寒冷，已使他们不成人样子。
    和李承晚的伪军一样，他们对于中国人民志愿军的俘虏政策是完全陌生的。他们受了美帝国主义的欺骗，认为“当了俘虏就要死”。当我们的战士指示他们移动一下位置时，他们心惊胆怕，面面相觑。有的居然伸长脖子，闭起眼睛，做出死前的悲哀姿态；有的干脆坐在地上不动，表示“就死在这里算了吧！”只有在我们说明了我们的俘虏政策以后，他们才会改变这种可笑的态度。但是，我们没有足够的翻译员，于是指战员们常常要用手先做出“杀”的姿势，然后再摆手做出“不”的姿势来说明我们不杀俘虏。或者把自己最好的干粮送给他们吃，给他们烧水洗脸止渴，以实际行动感化教育，使他们懂得我们的俘虏政策。这样，他们就会替我们开着美造汽车在公路上飞驰，而感到愉快。
    某团政治处保卫股收到两个美军伤俘。一个伤在脚部，拄一根拐杖，可以慢慢行动；另一个伤在腰部，失血较多，躺在炕上，脸色苍白，伤口一阵阵发痛，他就不断地伸出手来，用微弱的声音喊着“坦——白………”（朝鲜话把香烟叫“坦白”）
    小通讯员知道吸烟可以止痛，便卷了几十枝烟，一枝接一枝地递给他吸，并且小心地给他点火。保卫股长张广玉同志，看到这个重伤的俘虏不能吃普通的饭，便把自己仅有的两斤保健面拿来作稀面条和面饼，由通讯员喂着吃，有时还加些咖啡和巧克力糖。这样一直继续了三天。
    现在，某团收容负伤俘虏的工作已经普遍开展起来，团政治处又专门组织了一个收容队，由保卫干事冯时雨同志率领宣传队一个分队，担架队九付担架，两个护士，两个炊事员，一个事务员组成。显然，这已经是一个小小的野战收容所了。
    在某团后勤处驻地附近的山上，有一个美军伤兵每天匍匐着向山下暗暗探望，要想看看这些具有大勇和熟谙战争艺术的队伍，到底是些什么样的人物，他们在这里究竟干些什么。在他偷看的时候，满怀着恐惧，他的神经是十分紧张的。可是，几天以来映入他眼睑的，都是些穿着粗布衣服吃着包米渣子的和善人物。他们带着手榴弹和刚从美军手里夺获的自动步枪，不停地打米磨面打水扫院，有了闲空，就三五成群去开小组会。除此以外，没有发现任何可怕的东西。他逐渐不害怕了，想鼓起勇气下山讨饭吃。但是因为流血和饥渴的缘故，他已经只能爬在地上奄奄待毙了。就在这时候，他的面前出现了人民志愿军。他用手拍着肚子，伸出四个指头，表示四天没有吃东西了。志愿军的战士把他扶在担架上。
    冯时雨的收容队，陆续地收容了九个负伤俘虏，包括四个黑人和五个白人，加上原先的两个，共是十一个人了。护士和炊事员像对自己的伤兵一样地照护这十一个负伤俘虏。日子一天天地过去了，俘虏们常常伸出手来，紧握着志愿军战士的手不肯释放，表示感谢。
    部队要出发了。这是向三八线大进军，所有的人员都要参加这一伟大的行动。团首长派乔军同志向负伤俘虏致告别词。因为没有英文翻译，由会日文的教育干事马晓堂同志把中语译成日语，再由一个兼通英日两国语言的李承晚俘虏兵译成英语。乔军同志就在这临时病室里通过两层翻译，开始了他的演讲：
    “亲爱的美国弟兄们！我们是中国人民志愿军，是保卫自己祖国、保卫远东及世界和平的战士。我们反对美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，反对华尔街的战争贩子们发动新的侵略战争。我们中朝两国人民将与全世界爱好和平的人民一道，粉碎美帝国主义的任何进攻！但是我们并不反对美国人民。你们受了华尔街战争贩子的欺骗，被赶到朝鲜来当炮灰。我们中国人民志愿军是同情你们的，希望你们觉悟过来，反对全人类的公敌——美帝国主义者……”
    新颖的话语一句句地刺激着美国战俘的心灵，这是他们有生以来第一次听到这样的话。盘旋在他们心头的疑难开始解决了。重伤员也挣扎着坐起来，向中国人民志愿军表示感谢，并表示自己退出战争的决心。但是当他们听到我军要前进时，他们感到死的威胁又降临了。他们害怕被人杀害，怕饿死冻死，怕因创伤无人治疗而死。我们便与当地人民政府研究办法，并由我军代表乔军同志与新仓站村长共同宣布：第一、保证他们的生命安全；第二、保证有饭吃有房子住；第三、尽量请求人民军和中国人民志愿军后续部队代为治疗。此外，志愿军还发给负伤俘虏每人三百元朝币，作为养伤费。
    经过翻译员解释之后，这小小的临时病室沸腾了。被释放的美二师士兵杰克大呼：“我明白了，你们是真正的和平战士，是美国人民的真正朋友。我回国去，一定把你们的伟大行动，告诉美国人民知道。我们共同反对华尔街的战争贩子！”
    十九岁的青年士兵瓦克愤怒地说：“我伤好之后，一定和中国人民志愿军一起去打这战争贩子麦克阿瑟！”
    负了重伤的老兵汤姆斯躺在柜子下面说：“我当了十八年兵，走过二十多个国家，也打过一些仗，但从来没有见过像你们这样能征善战的军队，更没有见过像你们这样款待敌国俘虏的军队。我将永远忘不了你们！”他一面说着，一面挣扎着伸出他的手来，紧握着中国人民志愿军战士的手。他的眼泪涌满了眼眶。
  （二）
    当美帝国主义侵略军向鸭绿江疯狂进攻的时候，当美军士兵还不了解中国人民志愿军的俘虏政策的时候，他们是不大肯缴枪的。这就是我们在最初几次作战中，毙伤数目常在生俘数目的三倍以上的原因。但是中国人民志愿军基于伟大的革命正义感，终于克服种种困难，使生俘的比例一次比一次加大起来。
    在军隅里战役中，我们的一个俘虏管理大队，就收到美军第二师、二十五师、骑一师等部被俘士兵八百六十九人。其中除了美国人以外，还有墨西哥人、土耳其人和菲律宾人。战士们生俘这批敌兵，不是轻而易举的，而是经过了严重的战斗的。这群士兵受了美帝国主义者的欺骗：“到朝鲜打仗是执行联合国决议”，“打到三八线回家过圣诞节”。一般士兵对于这些欺骗宣传，虽也不很相信，但为了每月三百元美金，他们终于被赶到朝鲜，充当了侵略者的炮灰了。
    经过我们一个多月的耐心教育，他们开始觉悟了。
    美二师第二工兵营军需上士瓦特·邓肯（SFCW yat Duncon）说：“在被俘以前我不了解中国人民志愿军战士们的性格。现在我知道：你们作战最勇敢，对待俘虏最和善。”
    美二师第五○三中野炮营一等兵炮手詹姆士·杰克生（Pfc James H.Jackson）说：“我们都不需要战争。这次被俘，总算保全了生命。回国以后，再也不参加任何战争了。”
    该营第三连组长詹姆士·美威尔（SFC James Maywell）说：“在前线一个中国人民志愿军军官，曾经用他自己的救急包替我们裹伤，使我永世难忘。”
    当我们问到谁应负这次战争责任时，他们一致痛恨麦克阿瑟，齐说：“麦克阿瑟这战争贩子躲在数千里之外，叫我们来替资本家送死。他却在日本大喝其香槟，大跳其舞。希望你们早些抓住这老家伙，罚他受罪。”
    在俘虏管理大队里，有一个七十二人的军官中队，包括中校三名，少校十七名，上尉二十四名，中尉十九名，少尉五名，准尉四名。这些军官的头脑比一般的士兵更糊涂，而他们却比一般的士兵更怕死。
    伪二军团第七师团高级顾问克拉克根波中校（Clack Cumpbell）是这七十二名军官中最顽固的一个。他是在我志愿军某部英雄连长王世业同志所率领的第八连英雄战士经过七分钟的徒手格斗以后才同他的六个少校一起放下武器的。
    对于这批军官的教育，自然更加困难些。但是正义和真理终久是属于人民，而不属于任何反动派和任何歪曲的谬论。现在克拉克中校经过一个月的学习和内心斗争，终于带头发表了他原先所不愿意说而却是比较真实的意见了。
    “我很幸运能做中国军队的俘虏。我很明白，我们在这里所受的待遇是你们所能达到的最高待遇了。我们和你们住同样的房子，吃同样的伙食，没有受过任何侮辱。这一切都是我被俘以前所不能想像的。”
    对于伪军第七师团的被歼，他说：“伪七师失败的原因，首先是伪军士兵情绪低落，各级军官关系恶劣。但是最重要的，还是你们士兵作战勇敢，个别训练很好，不怕寒冷，不怕饥饿，善于单独作战和山地作战，善于夜战近战，善于侧面攻击和背后切断。你们的战术十分优越。你们缺少飞机大炮，但却能够战胜飞机大炮。我相信有如此优越的山地战术，在任何地区都能制胜敌人。”
  （三）
    “新年攻势”发起之后，中国人民志愿军以雷霆万钧之势，打击在美国侵略军和李承晚匪军的头上。美国人在过去两次作战中，认为是“没有固定的战线”，“打的不正规化”，否则不致那么狼狈。这一次是在“三八线”的固定战场上进行正规化的作战了，结果却是美李匪军更加狼狈，四百里宽正面的防御体系土崩瓦解了，上千架的飞机和上千门的大炮失去了效用。正如美国侵略者所供认：“在飞机大炮轰击下，那训练得很好的只带冲锋枪和手榴弹的士兵仍然汹涌前进”，“就是火山爆发也挡不住他们啊！”
    中国人民志愿军的先头部队于突破“三八线”之后，连续突破敌人三道防线，前进一百余里。敌人的“纵深配备”，没有一处能够抵挡我军。正如志愿军战士们所说：“美国人的特点是飞机多，大炮多，坦克多，汽车多，逃得快。”
    “由于敌人跑得快，我们追得紧，因此，在三十小时内，没有来得及架设电台。”这是先头部队向指挥部的报告。
    中国人民志愿军的英勇战士们，在一昼夜的追击中，爬山越岭，徒涉冰河，架设桥梁，忍受饥渴，克服了巨大的困难，终于在汉城以北的水落山附近，追上了逃跑的美军，并且切断了数千名李美匪军的退路。
    一个被俘的美军士兵，在我优待俘虏政策下深受感动，自告奋勇写了这样一封劝降信：
    “美国士兵们！
    这是一个被俘的美国兵写的。我相信你们如向他们投降，将会避免无谓的牺牲。
    他们就是中国人民志愿军，他们非常宽大地对待我和其他被俘的人。
          骑兵第一师  麦克道佛纳尔
        一九五一年一月一日”
    这封劝降信还没有发出去，成批美军投降的事情却在另一个地方发生了。美二十四师十九联队二百余人倒背着枪，打着小白旗，排着整齐的行列向我投降。显然，他们比溃逃时有次序得多了。
    突然，成排的大炮和成批的飞机，向这投降的队伍猛烈炸射了，机关枪也开火了。这是最凶恶的手段。但是投降者是很坚决的，他们冒死突出火网。除了死伤者以外，有一百零九个人到了志愿军的收容大队。
    这一百○九个人中，除了两个印度人、一个德国人和一个意大利人（都是在美国的侨民）外，其余都是美国人。他们都是在失业的威胁下，在每月三百元美金的诱骗下来充当侵略者的炮灰的。现在，他们在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的严重打击下，完全丧失了战斗意志。他们的共同目的只有一个，就是保全自己的生命。美军二十四师十九联队一营二连中尉排长党立刚投降过来，就吻着他老婆的信说：“这是我的爱人在圣诞节前给我祝福的信，她非常耽心我的生命安全。如果她知道我已经到了中国人民志愿军方面来，她一定会把悲痛变成庆幸的。”工人出身的士兵格雷斯愉快地说：“我是去年八月十六日被政府抓来的。我最初不愿意，但是当官的却说“每月三百元，保险不失业”。现在每天叫你们打死这样许多人，我们都愿意要性命，不愿意要这三百元了。”
