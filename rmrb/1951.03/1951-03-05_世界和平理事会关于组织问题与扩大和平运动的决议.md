　　Following a satisfactory review of the work accomplished in implementing the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress at its meeting in Berlin in February 1951, the World Peace Council deems it necessary to carry out these activities on a wider scale.

　　The World Peace Council recommends that the National Peace Committees disseminate the "Letter to the United Nations" with greater effort and promote it on a broad scale, so that it spreads to every place and penetrates the hearts of every people. The World Peace Council calls on all people to actively carry out this work on a national and international scale.

　　The World Peace Council notes with satisfaction that bills against war propaganda have been passed in several countries. The Council calls on the National Peace Committees to take measures to formulate bills to defend peace and oppose war propaganda, and to submit them to the national parliaments. The National Peace Committees should announce this matter to public opinion in order to win broad popular support for these measures. The Council calls on the National Peace Committees to mobilize public opinion to expose and resist all publications, declarations, speeches, films, and radio broadcasts, etc., that contain war plots.

　　The World Peace Council recommends that the National Peace Committees conduct extensive educational activities involving millions of good people who will tirelessly expose the lies that favor preparations for war in various countries.

　　The World Peace Council instructs the Executive Bureau to take measures to establish a press bureau within the Secretariat to publish objective news and factual materials, exposing false and distorted reports aimed at inciting war psychology.

　　The World Peace Council notes with satisfaction that the contacts established with many societies and groups in order to implement the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress have made it possible to develop and further expand the peace movement. The Council specifically adopts the following resolutions: (1) Continue negotiations with the "World Government Movement" in various countries in order to determine on what issues agreement can be reached and joint action can be taken, and encourage mutual participation in meetings and congresses. (2) Meetings proposed by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) should be organized according to the principle of equality and based on documents and resolutions, in order to seek conditions for joint action. (3) It is important to familiarize churches with the resolutions passed by the Council at this session and to request their support for these resolutions. Chairman Joliot-Curie, on behalf of the Executive Bureau, has sent a letter to the highest church authorities, informing them of the resolution on disarmament adopted by the Second World Peace Congress. The many replies already received have proven the attention that this notification has aroused. (4) It is necessary to develop contacts with the neutrality movements in various countries so that they can truly work to defend peace. (5) Seek to cooperate with the anti-war movement and all other groups, as long as this contact and cooperation can contribute to the cause of peace.

　　The World Peace Council notes with satisfaction the initiatives and recommendations regarding the organization of international conferences that would enable authoritative public representatives of various countries to exchange opinions and jointly resolve certain issues for the benefit of world peace. Such conferences make it possible to establish new contacts and further expand the movement to defend peace. The Peace Council advocates: (1) Convening a meeting of the people of the European signatory states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Paris or Brussels as soon as possible by the Franco-Belgian Committee against the Remilitarization of Germany, and inviting the German people to participate. The purpose of the meeting is to study the struggle against the remilitarization of Germany and the peaceful resolution of the German question. (2) Adopting the recommendation to organize a conference of Asian and Pacific countries, the main purpose of which is to discuss the struggle against the rearmament of Japan and the peaceful resolution of ongoing conflicts; at the same time, discuss the issue of holding a referendum on the remilitarization of Japan and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan this year in the relevant countries in Asia and the Pacific. (3) Instructing the Executive Bureau to assist in organizing regional conferences: (a) Regional conference of countries in the Near East and North Africa; (b) Regional conference of Scandinavian countries. (4) The Secretariat is recommended to consider organizing the following conferences: (a) Conference of countries in Black Africa; (b) Conference of countries in North America and Latin America (this conference may be held in Mexico in August). The World Peace Council urges the Peace Committees of the countries concerned to do their utmost to ensure the greatest success of these conferences.

　　The World Peace Council decided to convene an international economic conference in the Soviet Union in the summer of 1951, which will be attended by economists, technical experts, industrialists, businessmen, and trade union leaders from all over the world in order to restore economic relations between countries and improve the living standards of the people of all countries. The agenda of the conference will include: (a) the possibility of improving the living conditions of the people of all countries in the mid-twentieth century when peace is maintained; (b) the possibility of improving international economic relations.

　　The World Peace Council, in accordance with the decision of the Second World Peace Congress on cultural relations, instructs the Executive Bureau to provide all assistance to organize the conference of medical personnel proposed by prominent medical figures from France and Italy. This conference will be held in Italy this year and will focus on the struggle against the harmful effects of preparations for war on the public health of the masses. The Council also instructs the Executive Bureau to instruct the Secretariat to study and assist in holding an international conference to discuss how to develop national culture and international cultural cooperation when peace is maintained, and writers and artists, scientists, and filmmakers will participate in this conference. A conference of writers and artists will be held in 1951. The World Peace Council instructs the Secretariat to support the idea of convening conferences of educators, journalists, sports circles, etc. in the future. The Council recommends considering how to support the initiative of youth and student groups to launch a grand World Peace Defense Youth Festival in Berlin from August 5th to 19th, 1951.

　　The World Peace Council decided to establish an International Cultural Relations Committee under the Council, and the committee will hold regular meetings. The Council recommends that the National Peace Committees immediately establish Cultural Relations Committees, which should promote tourism (possible mutual tourism) in order to consolidate the cause of peace, and should promote the exchange of regular publications and cultural exhibitions. The Council instructs the Executive Bureau to study the following issues: establishing a film center responsible for encouraging and coordinating the production and promotion of films defending peace, and doing everything possible to expose the use of films for war propaganda.

　　The Council recommends that the Secretariat make all necessary efforts to ensure that all peace-loving scientists agree to include the requirement that they hope their scientific inventions will only be used for peaceful purposes in the regulations of international and national scientific organizations.

　　The Council calls on the National Peace Committees to give the most serious attention to raising the World Peace Fund. The success of this movement will once again prove that the people of all countries are loyal to the cause of peace. This will enable our movement to more effectively fulfill its mission.

　　The implementation of all these measures will indeed promote the expansion of our movement, and we should carry out extensive educational activities among the people of all walks of life in various countries, based on the resolutions that define our attitude towards peace issues, to promote our movement. These activities should create a foundation for free and sincere discussions and joint action to defend peace.
