Answering Readers' Questions Regarding Soybean Cake Issues

Recently, the different colors of black soybean cake and yellow soybean cake have caused many questions. This is because folks in provinces like Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi are accustomed to using black soybeans and black soybean cake, and not accustomed to using yellow soybean cake. This has led to incorrect notions such as black soybean cake being more potent than yellow soybean cake, and black soybeans having more oil than yellow soybeans. This year, in order to meet the needs of farmers, the government has transferred some yellow soybean cake from the Northeast, but some folks, influenced by habit, are hesitant to use it. In fact, yellow soybeans and black soybeans only differ in surface color, while their oil and protein content are not significantly different. The fertilizer efficacy of soybean cake mainly depends on the amount of nitrogen nutrients it contains, not on whether the color is black or yellow; nor does it depend on the amount of oil (using oil as fertilizer is a wrong habit; oil itself has no fertilizer effect).

The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute took locally produced black soybean cake and Northeast-produced yellow soybean cake from the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative on March 13th of this year for chemical analysis. The results are as follows:
		       Nitrogen Percentage	   Phosphoric Acid Percentage
Yellow Soybean Cake (Northeast)	6.36			1.37
Black Soybean Cake (Hebei Province)	6.40			1.23
(Yellow soybean cake contains more phosphoric acid, but the difference is only 2 liang, 2 qian, and 4 li, per 100 jin, which is extremely small.)

The Gongzhuling Agricultural Experiment Station once analyzed 421 varieties of soybeans, including 320 varieties of yellow soybeans, 49 varieties of green soybeans, 11 varieties of black soybeans, and 41 varieties of brown soybeans. The composition of yellow soybeans and black soybeans is listed as follows:
	  Crude Protein	 Crude Fat	 Soluble Nitrogen-Free Matter	Crude Fiber	Crude Ash
Yellow Soybean 	42.36		20.36		26.15			6.02		5.11
Black Soybean 	41.62		19.69		27.56			5.94		5.17

According to these chemical analyses, the chemical composition of yellow soybeans and black soybeans, yellow soybean cake and black soybean cake, is not significantly different. That is to say, the fertilizer efficacy of yellow soybean cake and black soybean cake is similar.

In fact, Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have the habit of using Northeast soybean cake. In the past, Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, and other provinces imported a large amount of soybean cake from the Northeast every year, which was very popular among farmers. Even in Hebei Province, some regions have the habit of using yellow soybean cake. Therefore, the current demand for black soybean cake and rejection of yellow soybean cake among the masses in Hebei, Henan, and other provinces is entirely due to habit, and has no scientific basis. Leaders and cadres should explain and persuade them in detail so that they can adopt it with confidence.

In tobacco-producing areas of Henan, another soybean cake issue has arisen. Henan commonly uses sesame cake for planting tobacco, and the masses demand a large supply. The China Native Produce Company and the Cooperative General Office only purchase and allocate a small portion. Folks also have concerns about using soybean cake. According to them, sesame cake has a long-lasting effect, and the growth of tobacco leaves is uniform, allowing the top and root tobacco leaves to be similar in size and quality. Soybean cake is strong and fast-acting. After application, the tobacco leaves grow rapidly, the bottom leaves grow very large, and the top becomes weak, which reduces the quality of the tobacco leaves. In fact, this is also a matter of habit. Shandong uses yellow soybean cake to grow tobacco, and there are also areas in Henan that use yellow soybean cake. In those places, the quality of tobacco leaves is also the same excellent. Furthermore, chemically analyzing the composition of soybean cake and sesame cake does reveal some differences. According to past data, the composition of sesame cake (produced in Shandong) and soybean cake is as follows:
	      Nitrogen Percentage	Phosphoric Acid Percentage	Potassium Oxide Percentage
Sesame Cake	4.90			2.00			0.92
Yellow Soybean Cake	6.25			1.79			1.40
(According to this table, the nitrogen and phosphoric acid content of yellow soybean cake differs slightly from the yellow soybean cake (produced in Northeast) in the table above. This is because of different soybean varieties.)

Based on the comparison of the two compositions, if 50 jin of soybean cake is applied per mu of tobacco land, compared to applying 50 jin of sesame cake, the nitrogen content increases by 25 percent, while phosphoric acid and potassium oxide decrease and increase slightly. We know that tobacco land in the Xuchang area is not very deficient in phosphorus and potassium nutrients. Changing from sesame cake to soybean cake and reducing the weight of soybean cake by 20 percent can ensure that the nitrogen content does not decrease, and the phosphorus and potassium content does not change much, so there is no impact. It is hoped that the leadership will also actively educate the masses to boldly adopt it. If it is to make the top and root of the tobacco leaves develop evenly, then the soybean cake can also be applied in two or three times.

    关于豆饼问题答读者问
    最近因为黑豆饼和黄豆饼的颜色不同，引起了许多疑问。这是因为河北、河南、山西、陕西等省老乡们有施用黑豆和黑豆饼的习惯，没有施用黄豆饼的习惯。因而有黑豆饼劲大黄豆饼劲差，黑豆油多黄豆油少等错误观念。今年政府为了大量供应农民需要，从东北调来了一些黄豆饼，可是有一部分老乡们因受习惯影响，不敢使用。其实黄豆和黑豆只是表面颜色不同，它们所含的油分和蛋白质成分却没有很大分别。豆饼的肥料效验，主要的在乎所含氮素养分的多少，不在乎颜色的黑或黄；也不在乎油分的多少（把油做肥料，是一种错误的习惯，油的本身，没有肥料效用）。
    华北农业科学研究所在本年三月十三日由石家庄供销合作社取来本地产的黑豆饼和东北产的黄豆饼进行化学分析，其结果为：
                 含氮百分数                  含磷酸百分数
    黄豆饼（东北产）      六·三六              一·三七
    黑豆饼（河北省产）    六·四○               一·二三
    （黄豆饼含磷酸较多，可是一百斤中只差二两二钱四厘，极其微小。）
    公主岭农事试验场曾经分析过四百二十一种大豆，包括黄豆三百二十种，青豆四十九种，黑豆十一种，褐豆四十一种，现将黄豆和黑豆的成分列举如次：
          粗蛋白      粗脂肪    可溶无氮物      粗纤维      粗灰分黄豆  四二·三六    二○·三六  二六·一五      六·○二 
   五·一一黑豆  四一·六二    一九·六九  二七·五六      五·九四    五·一七
    根据这些化验证明：黄豆和黑豆、黄豆饼和黑豆饼的化学成分，没有很大差别。就是说黄豆饼和黑豆饼的肥料效验是相仿的。
    实际上，在山东、苏南、苏北、浙江等省都有施用东北豆饼的习惯，广东、福建、台湾等省，在过去每年都从东北大量输入豆饼，极受农民欢迎，就是在河北省，也有些地区有施用黄豆饼的习惯。所以目前河北、河南等省群众要求黑豆饼而不欢迎黄豆饼，完全是因为习惯关系，没有科学的根据，领导上和干部应详为解释劝导，使他们放心采用。
    在河南产烟地区发生另外一个豆饼问题。河南种烟普通用芝麻饼，群众要求大量供应。中国土产公司和合作总社只收购和调拨一小部分。对于施用豆饼，老乡们也有顾虑。据老乡们说芝麻饼劲长，烟叶生长均匀，可以使得顶部和根部的烟叶大小和品质相似；豆饼劲大而快，施用以后烟叶迅速长大，底部的叶子长的很大而顶部瘦弱，这样便降低了烟叶的品质。实在这也是一个习惯问题。山东种烟都用黄豆饼，河南境内也有用黄豆饼的地区，那些地方，烟叶的品质也是同样的优良。再从化学上分析豆饼和芝麻饼的成分，确是有一些不同。根据过去资料芝麻饼（山东产）和豆饼的成分为：
                  含氮百分数      含磷酸百分数      含氧化钾百分数
    芝麻饼        四·九○          二·○○         ○·九二
    黄豆饼        六·二五          一·七九         一·四○
    （按此表黄豆饼与上表黄豆饼（东北产）含氮和磷酸的成分，都有微小出入，这是因为豆种不同。）
    根据两种成分比较，若是每亩烟地施用豆饼五十市斤，比施用芝麻饼五十市斤，氮的成分增多了百分之二十五，磷酸和氧化钾略有减少和增多。我们知道许昌一带烟地，磷钾养分不太缺乏，由芝麻饼改用豆饼减少豆饼重量二成，可以使氮分不减，磷钾成分亦改变不多，更无影响。希望领导上也积极教育群众，大胆采用。如果为使烟叶顶部根部发育均匀，则豆饼分二次三次施用亦可。
