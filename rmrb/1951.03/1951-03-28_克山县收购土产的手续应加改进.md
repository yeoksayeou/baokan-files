To the Editor:

The procedures for purchasing and selling local products handled by the Keshan County Tax Bureau and the Local Products Company in Heilongjiang are extremely cumbersome and unreasonable. This is very detrimental to the exchange of local products. Farmers who want to sell their products must first ask the Local Products Company if they want them; then go to the Tax Bureau to buy a shipping invoice; after filling it out, return to the Local Products Company to open another type of invoice; then take this invoice to the Tax Bureau to pay taxes and get a stamp; and finally go to the Local Products Company to collect payment. Each time the stamping procedure takes half an hour or an hour. Once, an old lady brought some pig bristles to the Local Products Company to sell, but when she learned about these many troublesome procedures, she left without selling her goods. What is even more unreasonable is that in January, when the Local Products Company transported two large carts of white pork, they had to pull the pigs to the Tax Bureau to stamp them with a "verified" mark, otherwise they could not be transported out.

Therefore, I would like to make two suggestions: First, when the Local Products Company purchases local products, it can deduct the tax payable by the seller in advance and pay it uniformly by the company at the end of the month, which can save farmers some unnecessary procedures; second, for the transportation of large quantities of local products, it is hoped that the tax bureau personnel will personally inspect the site, which can reduce the handling of goods and also reduce the cost of local products.

Editor's note: The Keshan County Local Products Company and the Tax Bureau should simplify procedures and improve work efficiency.

### 克山县收购土产的手续应加改进

专栏：来信摘要

　　克山县收购土产的手续应加改进编辑同志：
    黑龙江克山县税务局和土产公司办理土产收购和运销的手续极为繁琐和不合理。这对土产的交流工作是很不利的。农民要出售自己的产品，首先得到土产公司问好是否要；然后去税务局买一张发货票；填好以后，再回到土产公司开另一种货票；又拿这货票到税务局缴税盖章；最后到土产公司取款。而每次办理盖章手续总要等上半点钟或一个钟头的时间。有一次一个老太太拿了一些猪鬃到土产公司去卖，当她知道有这样许多麻烦手续时，货也不卖就走了。更使人感到不合理的事情是：在一月份土产公司向外运两大车白条猪，却一定要把猪拉到税务局门前打“验讫”图记，否则就运不出去。
    因此，我提出两点建议：第一、土产公司收购土产时，可将售货者应纳税款先行扣下，到月末由公司统一缴纳，这样可以省去农民的一些不必要手续；第二、贩运大批土产，希望税局人员亲自到现场验查，这可以减少货物的搬运，也可减低土产的成本。

    编者按：克山县土产公司与税务局应简化手续，提高工作效率。
