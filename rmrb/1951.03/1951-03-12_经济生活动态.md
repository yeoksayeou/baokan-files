　　Fujian's Large Quantities of Native Products Shipped and Sold Outside the Province
　　With the vigorous support of the People's Bank and state-owned trading organizations for private merchants to transport and sell Fujian's native products, the situation where it was difficult to transport and sell outside the province due to the blockade of seaports by US imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, has been broken. According to statistics of the reported output figures from private merchants, from September to the end of December last year, various native products such as fir wood, dried bamboo shoots, mushrooms, longan, sugar, tea, etc., totaling more than 29.7 million jin, worth approximately 30 billion RMB, were shipped out. In January of this year, the situation of shipping and selling native products outside the province was even more active. Private merchants requested the issuance of export certificates one after another. In Fuzhou city alone, the request to export fir wood reached more than 49,000 pieces, totaling more than 2.2 million chi, greatly exceeding the city's previous monthly timber export volume.
  
　　Guizhou's Paper Industry Gradually Develops
　　Before liberation, the Guiyang Qian Yuan Paper Mill produced about 900 reams of single-sided glossy paper per month. After liberation, with improved technology, production increased by 15%, and the quality was also finer and whiter than before. This year, it is planned to massively produce typing paper and newsprint, with the output in the first half of this year alone increasing by more than 80% compared to the entire last year. Moreover, the Tongzi Hongsheng Paper Mill was threatened by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's inflation before liberation, and faced capital shortages, often suspending work. After liberation, with the support of the People's Government and loans from the People's Bank, production has increased by 150% compared to the past. The typing paper and kraft paper produced are finer and more uniform than before, and the toughness has increased. Currently, the rough-edged paper and white paper made by handmade workshops in Zunyi, Duyun, Anshun and other places are sufficient for the daily needs of the people in the province.

　　经济生活动态
    福建大量土产运销省外
    福建省土产在人民银行及国营贸易机构大力扶助私商运销下，已打破了因美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮封锁海口而造成难以运销省外的状况。根据私商所报输出数字统计，去年九月至十二月底已运出各种土产如杉木、笋干、香菇、桂圆、糖、茶叶等共达二千九百七十多万市斤，约值人民币三百亿元。今年一月，该省土产运销省外的情形更是活跃，私商纷纷请求发给输出证明书，仅福州一市请求输出杉木一项就达四万九千多件，计达二百二十多万尺，大大超过以往该市每月木材输出量。
  贵州造纸业逐渐发展
    贵阳市黔元造纸厂解放前月产单面光纸九百令左右，解放后改进技术，产量提高了百分之十五，品质也较前细白。今年更计划大量生产打字纸和新闻纸，仅今年上半年即将比去年全年产量增加百分之八十以上。又桐梓鸿盛造纸厂解放前受蒋介石匪帮通货膨胀威胁，资金短绌，时常停工，解放后得到人民政府的扶助和人民银行的贷款，产量已比过去增加百分之一百五十，所产打字纸和牛皮纸较前细匀，且韧性加大。现遵义、都匀、安顺等地手工作坊所制毛边纸、白皮纸等已足够该省人民日常需用。
