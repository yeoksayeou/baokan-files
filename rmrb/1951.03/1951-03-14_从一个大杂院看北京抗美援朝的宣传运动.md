To the Editor:

　　The people of Beijing have made significant progress in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. However, the extent of this movement's development among various strata of the people is quite uneven. As far as I know, among many working people, especially unorganized working people, the depth of this patriotic movement is insufficient.

　　Take the case of a "big courtyard" at the back gate of No. 10, Er Tiao, Wo Fo Si, Seventh District, Beijing: this courtyard houses fourteen households, totaling forty-seven people. Among the men, eight are pedicab drivers (all members of the trade union), while the others are mostly unorganized laborers, petty traders, or small handicraftsmen. The women and children mostly go out to collect coal, with only two children attending elementary school. Most of them are illiterate, and no one in the courtyard can read a newspaper. They are generally poor and preoccupied with making a living, and they do not pay much attention to national affairs. This type of mass is relatively common in the Seventh District and accounts for a considerable number in the entire city of Beijing.

　　Amid the high tide of the national movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the residents of this "big courtyard" have more or less come into contact with this movement. Everyone knows the four characters "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea." Even the sixty-year-old Li Chen, a military dependent who rarely leaves the house, knows about "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea," but she doesn't know if the war is still going on in Korea. The pedicab drivers who have joined the trade union know that the United States is a paper tiger and that the United States is invading our Taiwan.

　　However, from the perspective of this "big courtyard," in the propaganda and educational work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, it is still far from meeting the requirement of "making every citizen consciously and actively participate in this movement; enabling everyone to receive education in the anti-American struggle and patriotism" (Peng Zhen's opening speech at the First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress). No one in the "big courtyard" has participated in demonstrations against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The public security pact passed by the Second Session of the Seventh District People's Congress (the content of which is to report household registration accurately, prevent sabotage by special agents, investigate rumors, and prevent fire and theft, etc.) is a pact for the residents of the Seventh District to participate in practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; however, the residents of the "big courtyard" say they "don't remember it." The pedicab drivers have all donated comfort items, but they don't really understand the meaning of the comfort efforts. They said: "The trade union called on everyone to donate voluntarily. We trust the trade union, so we donated." Many muddled ideas, such as the "Korean Stick" theory and the American "relief flour" issue, have not been thoroughly resolved.

### 从一个大杂院看北京抗美援朝的宣传运动

　　从一个大杂院看北京抗美援朝的宣传运动编辑同志：
    北京市人民的抗美援朝运动已经有了很大的发展。但是，这个运动在各阶层人民中发展的程度是很不一致的。据我所知，在许多劳动人民中，尤其是无组织的劳动人民中，这个爱国运动发展的深度是很不够的。
    以我所了解的北京市第七区卧佛寺二条十号后门的一个大杂院为例：这个大杂院中住有十四户，四十七个人。男人中，有八个是三轮工人（都参加了工会），其他则大部是做小工、做小买卖或做小手工业的无组织的劳动者。妇女和小孩大部出去捡煤，只有两个孩子在小学念书。他们大部是文盲，全院没人能看报。他们都比较贫苦，整日忙于生活，对国家大事不太关心。这一类型的群众，在第七区是比较多的，在全北京市也占相当数量。
    在全国人民抗美援朝爱国运动的高潮中，这个大杂院的居民或多或少地接触了这个运动。提起“抗美援朝”这四个字，大家都是知道的。很少出大门的六十多岁的军属李陈氏也知道了“抗美援朝”，但她不知道现在朝鲜是否还在打仗。参加了工会的三轮工人们则知道美国是纸老虎、美国侵略我国台湾等道理。
    但是，从这个大杂院看，在抗美援朝的宣传教育工作上，距离“使每个市民都自觉地积极地参加这个运动；使每一个人都能够受到反美斗争和爱国主义的教育”（彭真同志在北京市三届一次各界代表会议的开幕词）的要求还很远。大杂院中，没有人参加过抗美援朝的示威游行。第七区二届各界人民代表会议所通过的治安公约（内容是不漏报户口，防止特务破坏，追查谣言，防火防盗等），是七区居民参加抗美援朝实际行动的一个公约；但大杂院的居民对此都说“不记得了”。三轮工人们都捐过慰劳品，但他们对慰劳的意义却不很了解。他们说：“工会号召大家自愿捐。我们相信工会，就捐了。”许多糊涂思想，如“高丽棒子”论、美国“救济面粉”等问题，还没有彻底解决。
