The cooperatives at all levels in Hebei Province, in order to welcome the 1951 large-scale production movement and use practical actions to "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Home and the Country," have actively launched preparations to support spring planting production for cooperative members, including adjusting fertilizer, planning seeds, preparing agricultural tools, and exchanging livestock. After active planning by cooperatives at all levels, as of now, according to incomplete statistics, the province has prepared a total of 1.47 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds, 1 million jin of spring wheat seeds, 120,000 jin of peanut seeds, 5.61 million jin of coarse grain seeds, 200,000 jin of barley seeds, and 60,000 jin of kenaf seeds. In order to solve the difficulty of fertilizer shortage for cooperative members before spring planting, the provincial cooperative expects to exchange for more than 100 million jin of bean cake and more than 2 million jin of fertilizer powder, which are currently being transferred and distributed. In addition, the special district and county cooperatives have prepared more than 20 million jin of fertilizer, 1.98 million jin of black beans, and 11.32 million jin of manure; and collected and processed 51.2 million jin of cottonseed, which is pressed for oil and made into cakes for production. In order to protect seedlings, kill insects, and prevent diseases, 10,000 jin of pesticides and 25,200 jin of arsenic are also prepared. In addition, a total of 778,000 various agricultural implements were also prepared. Secondly, in order to solve the serious difficulty of lack of animal power in spring planting for cooperative members, the cooperative of Hebei Province is also preparing to transport the native cloth produced by the cooperative members to Chahar and Suiyuan to exchange for 4,000 heads of livestock, which will be sold to the cooperative members at low prices for spring planting. In disaster areas, they vigorously promote the agricultural and sideline products of cooperative members, exchange coarse grains for fine grains, and adjust early-maturing crop seeds so that they can concentrate on production and get through the spring famine.
    This work of the cooperatives in Hebei Province has not only created favorable conditions for the increase in cotton and grain production in the province this year but also encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cooperative members. For example, in order to solve the difficulty of lack of animal power for spring planting for cooperative members, the Zhanghuoshaofo Village Cooperative in Leting County mobilized cooperative members to collectively raise 4.55 million yuan and obtained a loan of 5.35 million yuan from the bank to purchase 11 large and small cattle and 5 donkeys from Lingyuan, Rehe. Cooperative members reflected, "The cooperative can really solve difficulties," "With these more livestock in our village, everyone can benefit from planting this spring."

　　河北省合作社为社员服务  准备大批春耕生产资料
    河北省各级合作社为了迎接一九五一年大生产运动，用实际行动来“抗美援朝，保家卫国”，积极展开了调剂肥料，筹划籽种，准备农具，换取牲口等支持社员春耕生产的准备工作。经各级合作社积极筹划，截至目前，据不完全统计，全省共准备了优良棉种一四七万斤，春麦种一百万斤，花生种十二万斤，粗粮种五六一万斤，大麦种二○万斤，洋麻种六万斤。为了解决春耕播种前社员缺乏肥料的困难，省社预期换购豆饼一亿余斤，肥田粉二百余万斤，目前正在转运分发中。此外，专区、县社准备的肥料亦有二千余万斤，黑豆一九八万斤，大粪一一三二万斤；征收加工棉籽五千一百二十万斤，榨油打饼，用于生产。为了保苗杀虫，防止病害，并准备了农药一万斤，信石二万五千二百斤。此外，还准备了各种农具共七十七万八千件。其次，为解决社员春耕中缺乏畜力的严重困难，该省合作社并准备将社员生产的土布，运往察哈尔和绥远换取牲口四千头，低价售予社员春耕使用。在灾区则大力推销社员农、副业产品，以粗粮换细粮，调剂早熟作物籽种，使能安心生产，度过春荒。
    该省合作社这一工作，不仅对该省今年棉粮增产创造了有利条件，并且鼓舞了广大社员生产情绪。如乐亭县张火烧佛村社为了解决社员春耕缺乏畜力的困难，发动社员集体凑资四五五万元，并由银行贷款五三五万元，赴热河凌源购来大小牛十一头，驴五头。社员反映说：“合作社真能解决困难”、“咱村多添这些牲口，今春种地大家都能沾点光”。
