A Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

　　The Qingyuan County Branch of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association, Shanxi Province
    A Self-Criticism Regarding the Problem of Stockpiled慰问品

To the Editor:

    We fully accept the criticism made by Comrade Ding Heling in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 19 regarding the stockpiling of large quantities of慰问品 in Qingyuan County without timely processing.

    The reason for this problem is mainly that our Qingyuan County Branch of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association failed to resolve the issue of transportation costs for the慰问品 in a timely manner. The person responsible for handling the慰问品 was Jia Gongji, the Deputy Secretary-General of this Association (also the curator of the county's Cultural Center). He requested instructions from the Chairman of this Association, Duan Qingping (Secretary of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party), the Vice-Chairman Wang Dalun (Magistrate of Qingyuan County), and the Secretary-General Qiang Zhihui (Director of the Propaganda Department of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party) regarding the issue of transportation costs for the慰问品, but received no resolution. As a result, these慰问品 were left in the Cultural Center. It was not until the criticism was published in the newspaper that we sent someone to transport the慰问品 to Taiyuan.

    This matter demonstrates that we have serious bureaucratic tendencies in our work. Although there were no explicit instructions from higher authorities regarding the expenditure of transportation fees for the慰问品, this was not an insurmountable problem. Due to our fear of trouble and reluctance to take responsibility, the problem was not resolved in a timely manner. We sincerely accept the newspaper's criticism and will correct this error in our future work.

                           Qingyuan County Branch of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　山西清源县中国人民抗美援朝分会
    对堆集慰劳品问题的检讨编辑同志：
    二月十九日人民日报《读者来信》栏所载丁鹤龄同志对清源县堆集大批慰劳品未及时处理的批评，我们完全接受。
    发生这一问题的原因，主要是我们清源县中国人民抗美援朝分会没有及时解决慰劳品的运输费用问题。负责处理慰劳品的是本会副秘书长贾拱极（本县文化馆馆长）。他为慰劳品的运输费用问题曾先后向本会会长段青平（中共清源县委会书记）、副会长王大伦（清源县县长）及秘书长强智慧（中共清源县委会宣传部长）请示，但都无结果。于是，这些慰劳品就这样放在文化馆。直到报纸上提出了批评，我们才派人把慰劳品送到太原。
    这件事情说明我们在工作中有着严重的官僚主义作风。慰劳品运输费开支问题虽然上级没有明文指示，但这并不是不能解决的。由于我们怕麻烦、怕负责，所以问题没有及时解决。我们诚恳接受报纸的批评，并在今后工作中改正这种错误。
