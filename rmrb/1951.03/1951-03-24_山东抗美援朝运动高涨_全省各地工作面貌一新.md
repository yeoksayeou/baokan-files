The Anti-American, Aid-Korea, and Defend-the-Homeland movement in Shandong Province began in November of last year and has lasted four and a half months. In this movement, various localities generally conducted anti-imperialist patriotic ideological education repeatedly through methods such as recounting suffering, recalling the past, and holding demonstrations. For example, in Jinan City, from December of last year to January of this year, nine anti-American patriotic demonstrations were held successively by youth and students, workers, business circles, scientific, medical, and engineering circles, Hui Muslims, women and children, religious groups and church schools, performing arts circles, and people from all walks of life over the age of sixty, with a total of over 120,000 participants. On February 18, another city-wide demonstration of 150,000 people was held, focusing on opposing the United States' rearmament of Japan. Qingdao City also held grand demonstration activities for youth and students, business circles, workers, religious circles, women's circles, and military families during the same period, with over 130,000 people from organized masses, organizations, and groups alone. Many unorganized masses, white-haired elderly, and elderly women with bound feet also actively participated in the ranks of this movement. Nearly 30,000 people from business circles and women's circles in Xuzhou held a demonstration rally on December 31 of last year. On January 9, more than 9,000 people from religious groups and church schools, including teachers and staff, braved the snow to hold a demonstration against Austin's slander and insult to the Chinese people. Religious figures in Yantai City conducted education among believers through the celebration of the liberation of Seoul, focusing on anti-American patriotism, obedience to the leadership of the People's Government, religious reform, and severing ties with imperialism. The Yantai City Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression convened a meeting of industrial and commercial managers to conduct education on hating America, despising America, and scorning America, and on this basis, initiated a movement to establish patriotic pacts. Other small and medium-sized cities and towns such as Xin Hailian, Weifang, Yidu, Jining, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Zichuan, Boshan, Dezhou, Jiaoxian, Laiyang, and Tai'an also held various symposiums and demonstration rallies for different representatives and the masses, combining with various work tasks to carry out anti-American, aid-Korea, defend-the-homeland, oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan, and sever ties with imperialism and other anti-imperialist patriotic ideological education. In some counties of the Wendeng Special District, lantern parades were also held during the Lantern Festival. Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Yantai, Jining, and other cities also organized large-scale current affairs propaganda activities, using various methods such as Yangko dances, living newspapers, waist drums, lantern slides, street plays, dramas, cartoons, blackboards, speech contests, current affairs talks, and discussion meetings to conduct anti-American, aid-Korea ideological education. For example, in Jinan City, in the primary school sector alone, from December 15 to 26, a period of twelve days, a huge propaganda team of more than 21,800 people was organized, including 166 drama troupes, propaganda teams, and street cartoon propaganda groups, and 1,151 family visit groups, living newspaper groups, and singing teams, which went to the streets and suburbs for mobile propaganda activities. The literary and art circles also organized thirteen Quyi (folk art forms) propaganda groups, which took turns performing in various cinemas, theaters, and propaganda stations every day. In addition, four permanent propaganda stations were established in People's Park, Youth Park, Baotuquan Cultural Center, Huangting and other places, attracting 120,000 spectators in just twelve days. In addition, the city held an anti-American, aid-Korea garden party in People's Park during the Spring Festival. A system of propagandists was also established among organized masses to conduct propaganda and education to the surrounding masses on a regular basis. Various agencies and garrison troops also organized resident work teams to conduct propaganda among residents. All of the above gatherings, demonstrations, and propaganda activities not only had a profound education on the participants themselves, but also had a profound education and impact on the broad masses of residents. In Jinan, several demonstrations also organized street residents to cooperate and provide tea and water, which had a very large impact on the scattered citizens. In rural areas, in close conjunction with the central task of completing land reform, more decentralized methods such as recounting suffering and recalling the past were used to raise the political awareness of the broad masses of peasants and their hatred for American imperialism. Many places also convened people's representative conferences, cadre meetings, activist meetings, and party representative conferences at all levels, first organizing the study of the People's Daily New Year's Day editorial "Consolidate Our Great Motherland Under the Great Banner of Patriotism" among cadres at all levels, and solving the confused ideas such as "anti-American, aid-Korea has no content." Then, it was linked to the personal interests and experiences of the peasant masses, from the shallow to the deep, from the near to the far, using the method of recalling the emancipation and making comparisons, from the relationship between the landlord feudal class and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the relationship between American imperialism and Japanese fascism, the relationship between the working people and their own motherland and world peace, the relationship between the Chinese people and Korea and the Soviet Union, clearly distinguishing between the two major camps, and concentrating the interests of all people on the goal of anti-American, aid-Korea, defending and building a great motherland. After education, the broad masses of peasants realized that "the land certificate is stained with blood, and many of the compatriots who died in the past were killed by American bullets," and that "Chiang Kai-shek is the backing of the landlord class, and American devils are Chiang Kai-shek's father," and that only the actual strength of the people can stop American aggression plots. This promoted various tasks, such as solving many complex problems of land reform, and actively promoting production, democratic construction of villages, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Wendeng Special District also developed more than 10,000 propagandists through winter schools and established a strong propaganda network in the development of current affairs propaganda. Many areas also universally carried out recreational activities and conducted large-scale and magnificent anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda activities by celebrating the victory of land reform. People's representative conferences at all levels and representative conferences of youth, women, peasants, and others for anti-American, aid-Korea and defending the homeland were also universally convened from top to bottom. At these meetings, a movement of recounting suffering was launched, from denouncing the disasters of the landlord class, Japanese invaders, and Chiang bandits, to linking them to the disasters of the Korean people, tracing the root to the heinous crimes of American imperialism, which greatly enhanced the anti-American patriotic thinking of the broad masses of peasants. For example, in the six new districts of Jimo County alone, 4,800 young people signed up to join the People's Liberation Army, proposing to "defeat the American devils' invasion and build a strong national defense." At the people's representative conference in Jimo County, women representatives rose up to demand to go to Korea to resist the US and participate in the national defense army, and asked the county head: "Isn't there gender equality? Why let men go and not women?" Some women representatives at the people's representative conference in Jiaoxian County even shaved their heads to join the volunteer army to defeat the American devils' invasion.

Because various localities have conscientiously and repeatedly carried out anti-imperialist patriotic ideological education, the movement has now converged into a surging new patriotic torrent in many areas, its momentum is unprecedentedly magnificent, and it has become a huge force to promote the entire production, work and study, and has given the province a new look. Some believers and teachers and staff of church schools who have been deeply influenced by imperialist cultural aggression for a long time have publicly exposed and reviewed their long-standing wrong ideas. Many priests and believers said: We resolutely cut off ties with imperialism and will no longer eat foreign milk from now on. For example, many people in business circles have changed their past wrong attitude of "doing business with whoever comes," and encourage each other to overcome difficulties: "Don't forget to resist the US and aid Korea." Through their own experiences, the broad masses of peasants have realized that the landlord class relies on the Chiang bandits to carry out counter-settlement, and the Chiang bandit gang relies on American imperialism to oppress and massacre the people, which has raised the awareness of armed forces, strengthened the will and determination to resolutely destroy feudal forces and suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and overcome the ideological tendencies of peace paralysis and slackness. For example, some peasants in Huimin Special District and other places publicly reviewed their past thoughts of complaining about the heavy public grain this time. They said: "If we had known it was because of American aggression, we should have given more." In some villages in Bin County and Huimin and other places where public grain had not been paid off for several years, it was quickly paid off through this movement. During the New Year and Spring Festival, revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers were universally given honorary plaques, honorary lamps, as well as flour, meat, and vegetables. Young women swept yards, carried water, picked up firewood, and washed clothes for revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers. Change teams checked the shortcomings in the previous substitute farming and formulated future substitute farming systems and plans. Many peasants rushed to participate when they heard that a meeting to resist the US and aid Korea was being held in the village. When Jinan held a city-wide demonstration against the United States' arming of Japan on February 18, some peasants came from places thirty or forty miles away to participate. One old lady over seventy years old also insisted on participating. When others dissuaded her, she firmly replied: "This is to oppose the arming of Japan. One more person means one more strength. You can't represent me." The broad masses of workers in various places enthusiastically carried out production competitions, and new production records and various innovations and inventions continued to emerge. For example, in Jinan alone, 49 public and private factories and more than 21,000 workers participated in the intense patriotic production competition. Street working women completed the military production tasks of 350,000 sets of cotton clothes and 110,000 pairs of shoe soles ahead of schedule. The city's business community donated nearly 1.3 billion yuan in Renminbi in less than three days to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Forces and provide relief to Korean refugees. In various places, the number of young students who volunteered to enroll in military cadre schools was one-third and one-half of the eligible students, and in some schools the number of applicants reached more than 80%. In addition to completing the donation of 1 billion yuan in Renminbi to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Volunteers and provide relief to Korean refugees, Qingdao's business community also launched a red flag competition for tax payment in order to ensure the completion of the state's tax revenue tasks, and proposed to resolutely clear up arrears. Many industries achieved early tax payment. Among them, the knitting industry with 250 households took only two days from deployment to tax payment, and the business tax of more than 900 households in Gaomi urban area was also fully paid in three days. The suburbs of the county had a backlog of more than 250,000 jin of public grain in the autumn of last year. After the anti-American, aid-Korea movement was launched, except for 3,000 jin that could not be paid due to actual difficulties, the rest were paid off. Teng County's urban business tax was also completed in thirteen days.

An important experience has been gained in carrying out the anti-American, aid-Korea, and defend-the-homeland movement in various places. This is: repeatedly popularizing in-depth anti-imperialist patriotic ideological education and universally establishing and constantly inspecting and implementing patriotic pacts. First of all, based on the personal interests and experiences of the people, through recalling suffering, using various specific facts to make the broad masses of people realize the aggressive nature of American imperialism, and closely combining it with the current actual struggles, to stimulate their anti-American patriotic thinking. This is the ideological foundation of the anti-American, aid-Korea, and defend-the-homeland movement. On this ideological basis, patriotic pacts are universally established according to the specific circumstances of different classes and groups, and the broad masses of people's high anti-American patriotic thinking is closely combined with their own practical actions, which is the best way to make the anti-American, aid-Korea, and defend-the-homeland movement lasting and in-depth. Constantly inspecting and implementing patriotic pacts and promoting them to be put into action is an important link in further improving and deepening the anti-American, aid-Korea, and defend-the-homeland movement.

At present, although the anti-American, aid-Korea, and defend-the-homeland movement in various places has achieved unprecedentedly wide and in-depth development, and has become a huge driving force for promoting the entire production and work in many places, there are still great phenomena of lack of popularization, lack of depth, and imbalance in some areas. In particular, in many places, after the establishment of patriotic pacts, no further organization was carried out to inspect and implement them, so that some patriotic pacts were reduced to formalities. In addition, the work of urban street residents, suburban farmers, housewives, as well as small mountain villages and areas with inconvenient transportation is quite weak, and some have not even been affected by this movement. It is urgent to strengthen leadership and truly enable every place and everyone to receive anti-American, aid-Korea education.

　　山东抗美援朝运动高涨
    全省各地工作面貌一新
    山东省抗美援朝保家卫国运动是在去年十一月份开始的，历时四个半月。各地在这一运动中，一般都通过诉苦、回忆、示威游行等方式，反复进行了反帝爱国思想教育。如济南市自去年十二月至今年一月两个月中，即曾先后举行了青年学生、工人、工商界、科学医务工程界、回民、妇女儿童、宗教团体与教会学校、曲艺界、各界六十岁以上老人等九次反美爱国示威游行，参加人数达十二万余之众。二月十八日又举行了一次以反对美国重新武装日本为中心的全市性的十五万人的大示威游行。青岛市也在同一时间内分别举行了青年学生、工商界、工人、宗教界、妇女界、军属等盛大的示威游行活动，其中仅有组织的群众和机关、团体等即达十三万余人。许多无组织的群众，白发老人，小脚老年妇女亦均踊跃参加了这一运动行列。徐州工商界与妇女界近三万人，在去年十二月三十一日举行了示威游行大会。一月九日，宗教团体与教会学校师生员工九千多人又冒雪举行反奥斯汀毁谤与侮辱我国人民的示威游行。烟台市宗教界人士通过庆祝汉城解放，在教徒中进行了抗美爱国、服从人民政府领导、革新宗教和割断与帝国主义联系等教育。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会烟台市分会召开了工商业经理会议，进行仇视美国、鄙视美国、蔑视美国的教育，并在这一基础上发起了订立爱国公约运动。其他各中小城镇如新海连、潍坊、益都、济宁、张店、周村、淄川、博山、德州、胶县、莱阳、泰安等地亦均先后举行了各种不同代表人物与群众的座谈会和示威游行大会，结合各项工作任务，进行抗美援朝保家卫国、反对美国重新武装日本、割断与帝国主义联系等反帝爱国思想教育。在文登专区有的县并利用灯节举行了提灯游行。济南、青岛、徐州、烟台、济宁及其他一些城市并有组织地开展了大规模的时事宣传活动，通过秧歌、活报、腰鼓、幻灯、街头剧、戏剧、漫画、黑板报、讲演竞赛会、时事漫谈会、讨论会等各种方式进行抗美援朝思想教育。如济南市仅小学方面自十二月十五日至二十六日十二天，即组织了二万一千八百余人的庞大宣传队，共组织话剧团、宣传队、街头漫画宣传组等一百六十六个，家庭访问组、活报组、歌咏队等一千一百五十一个，分往街头、郊区进行巡回宣传活动。文艺界亦组织了十三个曲艺宣传小组，每天轮流到各影剧院和宣传站演唱。此外，还在人民公园、青年公园、趵突泉文化馆、皇亭等地建立了四个经常性的宣传站，十二天中仅以上四处即有观众十二万人。此外，该市并在春节中于人民公园举行了抗美援朝的游园大会。在有组织的群众中更建立了宣传员制度，经常向周围群众进行宣传教育。各机关、驻军亦组织了驻地工作组，对居民进行宣传。所有以上各种集会、示威游行和宣传活动，不但对参加者本身有着很深刻的教育，同时并使广大居民群众也受到了很深的教育和影响。在济南有几次示威游行并组织了街头市民的配合行动与茶水招待，对分散市民的影响作用也非常大。各地农村，在与结束完成土地改革中心任务紧紧结合下，则采用了较为分散的诉苦回忆等方式提高广大农民的政治认识与对美帝国主义的仇恨，很多地方并召开了各界人民代表会议、干部大会、活动分子会与党代表会议，首先在各级干部中组织学习了人民日报元旦社论《在爱国主义伟大旗帜下巩固我们的伟大祖国》，解决了认为“抗美援朝没有内容”等糊涂观念。进而又和农民群众的切身利益与经验联系起来，由浅入深，由近及远，运用回忆翻身对比的方法，从地主封建阶级与蒋匪帮、美帝国主义的关系，美帝国主义与日本法西斯的关系，劳动人民与自己祖国与世界和平的关系，中国人民与朝鲜及苏联的关系，划清两大阵营，把一切人民的利益都集中到抗美援朝、保卫与建设伟大祖国这一目标上。经过教育，广大农民认识了“土地证是血染的，过去死难的同胞不少是让美国子弹打死的”，“蒋介石是地主阶级的靠山，美国鬼子又是蒋介石的爸爸”，只有用人民的实际力量才能制止美国侵略阴谋。从而推动了各项工作，如土地改革许多复杂问题都迎刃而解了，生产、民主建乡、镇压反革命等工作也主动了。文登专区并在开展时事宣传中，通过冬学发展了一万余宣传员，建立了强大的宣传网。很多地区并通过庆祝土地改革的胜利，普遍开展了文娱活动，进行了大规模的声势壮阔的抗美援朝宣传活动。又自上而下地普遍召开了各界人民代表会议以及青年、妇女、农民等抗美援朝保家卫国代表会议。在这些会议上，展开了诉苦运动，从控诉地主阶级、日寇、蒋匪的灾害，联系到朝鲜人民的灾难，追根联系到美帝国主义的滔天罪行，大大提高了广大农民群众的仇美爱国思想。如仅即（墨）东县六个新区即有四千八百青年报名参加解放军，提出“打败美国鬼子侵略建设强大国防”。在即墨县各界人民代表会议上，妇女代表蜂起要求赴朝抗美和参加国防军，并问县长：“不是男女平等吗？为什么让男的去不让女的去？”胶县各界人民代表会议有的妇女代表更剃光了头发，要去参加志愿军打败美国鬼子的侵略。
    由于各地认真反复进行了反帝爱国思想教育，目前，这一运动已在很多地区汇成了高涨的新爱国主义洪流，其声势空前壮阔，成为推动整个生产、工作与学习的巨大力量，使全省面貌为之一新。过去长期受帝国主义文化侵略影响的一些教徒和教会学校师生员工，公开揭发与检讨了自己长期存在的错误思想。许多神甫与教徒表示：坚决和帝国主义割断联系，从此不再吃洋奶。再如很多工商界人士改变了过去“谁来都是做生意”的错误态度，相互勉励克服困难：“不要忘了抗美援朝。”广大农民通过自己的亲身经历，认识了地主阶级依靠蒋匪进行倒算，蒋匪帮又依靠美帝国主义压迫屠杀人民，提高了武装观念，加强了坚决摧毁封建势力镇压反革命活动的意志和决心，克服了和平麻痹、松懈等思想倾向。如惠民专区等地有些农民这次公开检讨了自己过去埋怨公粮重的思想。说：“早知道是因为美国侵略咱，再多拿些也应该。”滨县、惠民等地有几年来未交清公粮的乡村，通过这次运动迅速地交齐了。各地在新年和春节期间更普遍地给革命烈士、革命军人家属送了光荣牌光荣灯以及面、肉、菜，青年妇女为革命烈士、革命军人家属扫院子、挑水、拾柴火、洗衣服等，变工组检查了以前代耕中的缺点，订出了今后的代耕制度和计划。很多农民听说村里召开抗美援朝大会，争着前往参加，二月十八日济南举行全市反对美国武装日本示威游行大会时，有的农民从三四十里以外的地方赶来参加，其中有一七十余岁老太太也坚决要来参加，当别人劝阻她时，她坚定地回答：“这是反对武装日本，多一个人就多一份力量，你们去代表不了我去。”各地广大职工热烈开展生产竞赛，不断涌现新的生产纪录和各种革新发明创造。如济南一地即有四十九个公私营工厂二万一千余职工投入了紧张的爱国生产竞赛运动。街道劳动妇女提前完成了三十五万套棉衣和十一万双鞋底的军需生产任务。该市工商界在不到三天的时间中，即捐献人民币近十三亿元，慰问中朝人民部队与救济朝鲜难民。各地青年学生志愿报名参加军事干部学校者均在适龄学生的三分之一和二分之一以上，有的学校报名人数竟达百分之八十以上。青岛工商界除完成十亿元人民币捐款慰劳中朝人民战士和救济朝鲜难民外，为了保证国家税收任务的完成，并开展了缴税红旗竞赛，提出坚决清除尾欠，许多行业做到提早交清税款。其中拥有二百五十户的针织业，从布置到缴税仅费时两天，高密城区九百多户营业税三天时间也全部交齐。该县郊区在去年秋季公粮尾欠二十五万余斤，抗美援朝运动开展后除三千斤因实在困难无法交上外，其余也都交清。滕县城区冬季营业税也在十三天内完成了任务。
    各地在开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动中已取得一项重要经验。这就是：反复普及深入反帝爱国思想教育和普遍订立与不断检查贯彻爱国公约。首先，根据人民群众的切身利益和其亲身经验，通过回忆诉苦，采用各种具体事实使广大人民认识美帝国主义的侵略本质，并和当前各项实际斗争密切结合起来，激发其仇美爱国思想。这是抗美援朝保家卫国运动的思想基础。在这一思想基础上，分别按照不同阶层和团体的具体情况，普遍订立爱国公约，把广大人民群众的高度仇美爱国思想与各人的实际行动密切结合起来，这是使抗美援朝保家卫国运动持久深入下去的最好的方法。而不断检查贯彻爱国公约并促其付诸行动，则是进一步提高与深入抗美援朝保家卫国运动的重要一环。
    目前，各地抗美援朝保家卫国运动虽已获得空前广泛与深入的发展，并已在许多地方成为推动整个生产与工作的巨大动力，但部分地区仍存在很大的不普及，不深入，不平衡的现象。特别是许多地方在订立爱国公约以后，未进一步组织检查贯彻，以致有的爱国公约流于形式。另外，城市街道居民、郊区农民、家庭妇女以及农村小山庄和交通不便地带的工作相当薄弱，有的甚至还未受到这一运动的波及。亟应加强领导，真正使每一处、每一人都能受到抗美援朝教育。
