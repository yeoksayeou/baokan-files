Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 8th: The meeting of the four Assistant Foreign Ministers, convened to draft the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting, continued its work on March 7th, chaired by Soviet representative Gromyko.

According to information obtained, Gromyko stated at the meeting that the Soviet delegation would not object to including the Austrian treaty issue as a separate item on the agenda, meaning that the issue of fulfilling the relevant parts of the Italian treaty concerning Trieste would also be included. Gromyko pointed out that the US, Britain, and France had illegally transformed Trieste into a US-British military base, thus violating the Italian treaty. Because the Western three governments continue to fail to fulfill their obligations under the Italian treaty, there is no guarantee that they will fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Austrian treaty, nor is there a guarantee that, after the treaty is concluded, they will not use the same pretext to turn Austria into a US-British military base, as they did with Trieste.

US representative Jessup insisted on including only the Austrian treaty issue on the agenda and expressed disagreement with the suggestion to include the issue of Trieste on the agenda simultaneously. He groundlessly asserted that the two issues were not interconnected.

French representative Parrot and British representative Davies successively expressed agreement with the US representative's attitude.

In response to the representatives of the Western countries, Gromyko cited various facts to prove that the Western countries are responsible for delaying the Austrian treaty because they are trying to prepare an Austrian treaty that would place Austria under the control of Austrian accomplices who helped Hitler launch a war of aggression against European countries.

Gromyko said that it is completely unfounded to say that the Austrian treaty has nothing to do with the Trieste issue. Representatives of Western countries cannot deny the fact that, due to Western countries' violation of the Italian treaty, Trieste has become a US-British military base. Gromyko asked, where is the guarantee that Austria will not become a second Trieste?

After Jessup and Parrot delivered speeches insisting on their attitudes, the meeting decided to reconvene on March 8th to continue the discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 9th: The meeting of the four Assistant Foreign Ministers continued its work on the 8th, chaired by US representative Jessup.

French representative Parrot and British representative Davies successively spoke at the meeting, repeating all the "arguments" they had used in previous meetings, stubbornly insisting that the meeting adopt their proposed draft agenda, which could only lead the four Foreign Ministers' meeting to fruitless and empty discussions, while avoiding discussing the specific and urgent issues that concern the people of Europe according to the agenda suggested by the Soviet Union, such as the elimination of German militarism and the prevention of German re-militarization, as well as the issue of the four countries reducing their troops.

Subsequently, Soviet representative Gromyko stated that the so-called statement in the speeches of Parrot and Davies that the agenda items proposed by the Soviet delegation could be discussed "incidentally" when discussing the issues raised by the three Western countries is unfounded. There is an essential difference between the Soviet delegation's suggestion to discuss pressing issues that are of concern to all countries and must be resolved, and the three countries' draft agenda, which ignores these issues.

In response to Jessup's statement that the second item on the Soviet agenda—regarding accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing occupation troops from Germany—did not mention the unification of Germany, Gromyko said: The Soviet delegation believes that the solution to the issue of a peace treaty with Germany simultaneously means the solution to the issue of unifying Germany and restoring the unified peace-loving German Democratic Republic. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, the Soviet delegation believes that the wording of its second agenda item can be amended to: On the issue of restoring the unification of Germany, accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and withdrawing occupation troops from Germany in accordance with this treaty.

Gromyko pointed out that the so-called argument that the third item on the Soviet proposed agenda, regarding improving the European situation and immediately starting to reduce the troops of the four countries, is not worth discussing as an independent item has fallen flat. He said: It is well known that the tense situation in Europe is caused by the frantic arms race being carried out by certain countries, primarily by the three Western countries participating in this meeting. The representatives of the Western three countries advocate that this issue should be discussed in the United Nations, but it is precisely in the United Nations that representatives of certain countries, especially the United States, are doing everything possible to stifle all proposals aimed at genuine disarmament.

In conclusion, Gromyko said: Although Parrot requested that the meeting proceed along a constructive path, the representatives of the three Western countries have not shown any significant change sufficient to make the realization of this request possible.

US representative Jessup also spoke at this meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for the 9th.

### 四国外长助理会议继续举行  苏联代表葛罗米柯斥三国疯狂扩军  美英法故意闪避讨论重要问题

　　四国外长助理会议继续举行
    苏联代表葛罗米柯斥三国疯狂扩军
    美英法故意闪避讨论重要问题
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎八日讯：为草拟外长会议议程而召开的四国外长会议助理会议于三月七日继续工作，由苏联代表葛罗米柯担任主席。
    根据能够获悉的消息，葛罗米柯在会上演说称，苏联代表团将不反对把对奥和约问题当作一个单独的议案列入议程，意思是说履行对意和约中有关的里雅斯特的部分的问题也将被包括在内。葛罗米柯指出，美、英、法非法地把的里雅斯特变成美英军事基地，因此已违反了对意和约。由于西方三国政府继续不履行它们在对意和约中所担负的义务，因此并不能保证它们将履行对奥和约规定的义务，也不能保证：在和约缔结后，它们不会以同样的借口把奥地利变成美英的军事基地，象对付的里雅斯特一样。
    美国代表耶塞普坚持要求只把对奥和约问题列入议程，并表示不同意同时把关于的里雅斯特问题的议案列入议程的建议。他毫无根据地断言，这两个问题不是相互关联的。
    法国代表巴罗第及英国代表戴维斯相继表示同意美国代表的态度。
    在答复西方国家代表时，葛罗米柯引证各种事实，证明西方国家要负拖延对奥和约的责任，因为它们力图准备一种对奥和约，来把奥地利置于帮助希特勒对欧洲国家发动侵略战争的奥地利帮凶的支配下。
    葛罗米柯说，说对奥和约与的里雅斯特问题没有关系，是十分没有根据的。西方国家代表不能否认这一事实：由于西方国家违反对意和约，的里雅斯特已经成为美英的军事基地了。葛罗米柯问道，奥地利不会成为第二个的里雅斯特的保证在那里呢？
    在耶塞普和巴罗第发表了坚持他们的态度的演说后，会议决定至三月八日再开会继续讨论。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎九日讯：四国外长助理会议于八日继续工作，由美国代表耶塞普任主席。
    法国代表巴罗第和英国代表戴维斯在会上相继发言，重复他们在前几次会议上所使用的所有“论据”，硬要会议采纳他们所提出只能把四外长会议引上不得要领的空洞讨论的议程草案，而避免按照苏联建议的议程来讨论引起欧洲人民焦虑的具体的急迫的问题，例如肃清德国军国主义与防止德国重新军国主义化问题以及四国裁减军队问题等。
    随后，苏联代表葛罗米柯发言称：巴罗第与戴维斯发言中所谓苏联代表团建议的议程项目可以在讨论三个西方国家所提出的问题时“附带”加以讨论的说法，是没有根据的。苏联代表团建议讨论引起各国焦虑并必须予以解决的迫切问题，而三国代表团的议程草案却把这些问题搁置不顾；这两者之间有着本质上的区别。
    葛罗米柯在答复耶塞普所称苏联议程第二项——关于加速缔结对德和约并撤退驻德占领军问题中没有提到德国的统一时说：苏联代表团认为关于对德和约问题的解决，同时就意味着关于统一德国及恢复统一的爱好和平的德意志民主共和国的问题的解决。为了避免任何误解，苏联代表团认为可以将它的议程草案第二项措辞修改为：关于恢复德国的统一，加速缔结对德和约以及遵照这个和约从德国撤退占领军的问题。
    葛罗米柯指出：所谓苏联建议议程中第三项关于改善欧洲局势和立即开始裁减四国军队的问题不值得作为独立项目来讨论的说法，已经破产。他说：尽人皆知，欧洲的紧张局势是由于某些国家、首先是由于参加这个会议的三个西方国家正在进行的疯狂的军备竞赛所造成。西方三国代表主张这一问题应在联合国中讨论，但是，恰恰是在联合国中，某些国家特别是美国的代表，正在千方百计地力图扼杀以真正裁军为目的的一切建议。
    葛罗米柯在结语中说：虽然巴罗第要求使会议沿着建设性的途径进行，但是，三个西方国家的代表们却没有表现足以使这个要求之实现成为可能的任何重大转变。
    美国代表耶塞普也在这次会议上发言。下次会议定于九日举行。
