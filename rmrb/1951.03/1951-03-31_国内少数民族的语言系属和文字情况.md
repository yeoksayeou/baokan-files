　　The Linguistic Affiliations and Writing Systems of Ethnic Minorities in China
　　Luo Changpei, Director of the Institute of Linguistics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

　　(I) Linguistic Affiliations of Ethnic Minorities

　　According to the records of old local chronicles and the names used by local people, the categories of ethnic minorities in China are indeed numerous, which can be confusing to hear. In reality, if classified according to linguistic affiliation, there are only three families, seven groups, and nineteen branches; the languages under each branch are merely dialects of different subgroups within the same branch:

　　A. Sino-Tibetan Language Family

　　I. Kam-Tai Language Group (or Dong-Tai Language Group), mainly distributed in Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan Island, etc.

　　1. Kam-Sui Branch—A. Kam Language B. Sui Language C. Mak Language D. Yanghuang Language

　　2. Tai Branch—A. Zhuang Language (Nong Language) B. Zhongjia (Tujia) Language C. Gelao Language (Qelaot, Tulao, Mulam) D. Tai Language (Paiyi, Shan, Lü, Sa) E. Li Language

　　II. Miao-Yao Language Group, mainly distributed in the mountainous areas of western Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and western Guangdong.

　　1. Miao Branch

　　2. Yao Branch

　　III. Tibeto-Burman Language Group, mainly distributed in Tibet, Xikang, Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc.

　　1. Tibetan Branch—A. Western Dialect (Balti, Ladakhi) B. Central Dialect (Lhasa) C. Eastern Dialect (Xikang, Gyarong) D. Qiang, Nusu Languages

　　2. Jingpho Branch (or Kachin Branch)

　　3. Burman Branch—A. Achang Language B. Lashi Language

　　4. Yi Branch—A. Yi Language (Nasü, Lisu, Lolo, Sani, Axi, Akha, Honi, etc.) B. Naxi Language (Mosuo) C. Minjia Language (Baifan, Bai, Nama) (Attached)

　　B. Austro-Asiatic Language Family

　　I. Mon-Khmer Group, mainly distributed in the so-called "Hulu King Area" in the far west of Yunnan, and between the Lancang River and the Nujiang River, south of 27 degrees north latitude.

　　1. Wa-Palaung Branch—A. Palaung Language B. Riang Language C. Wa Language

　　2. Pumi Branch (or Prinmi)

　　(Note) Some say that the languages of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples belong to the Austronesian language family. Before a definitive conclusion is reached after investigation and research, it is temporarily listed here.

　　C. Altaic Language Family

　　I. Turkic Language Group, mainly distributed in most of Xinjiang, the northwestern corner of Mongolia, and part of Gansu.

　　1. Tuvinian Branch—Only the Salar language is found domestically.

　　2. Uyghur Branch—A. Uyghur Language B. Uzbek Language C. Tatar Language

　　3. Kazakh Branch—A. Kazakh Language B. Kyrgyz Language

　　(Note) The Tajik language, distributed in Puli County in southern Xinjiang, belongs to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family and does not belong to the Altaic language family.

　　II. Mongolian Language Group, mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and various provinces in North China.

　　1. Eastern and Southern Dialects

　　2. Khalkha Branch

　　3. Kalmyk Branch

　　4. Buryat Branch

　　III. Tungusic Language Group, mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia, the northeastern corner of Heilongjiang, and the lower reaches of the Songhua River.

　　1. Southern Branch—A. Manchu Language B. Xibe Language C. Solon Language D. Daur Language E. Hezhe Language

　　2. Northern Branch—A. Oroqen Language B. Manegir Language C. Birar Language

　　From the above classification, it can be seen that nationalities that were once considered very complex can be grouped into these families and branches by distinguishing them according to the language system, which is not to the extent of being "impossible to sort out." However, the grouping here is only a preliminary opinion, and further investigation and research are necessary for accurate analysis.

　　(II) Writing Systems of Ethnic Minorities

　　According to the Common Program's policy on nationalities, "All ethnic minorities have the freedom to develop their languages and writing systems, and to maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs. The People's Government should help the broad masses of ethnic minorities develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings" (Article 53). If we want to help ethnic minorities develop various construction undertakings, we must first study their languages and writing systems. Stalin said, "Minorities are dissatisfied not because of the lack of national alliances, but because of the lack of the right to use their own languages. Once they have the right to use their own languages, this dissatisfaction will naturally disappear." However, to enable the languages of all ethnic groups to play a broad role in helping to improve the cultural level of the masses, writing systems that record spoken language are especially needed. Among the various ethnic languages mentioned above, only a very small number have self-created writing systems, and most have no writing systems, which is a major obstacle to the development of culture, education, and even political and economic construction undertakings. After the success of the October Revolution, the new Soviet government determined that ethnic minorities should use their own languages and writing systems among themselves. Article 40 of the new constitution promulgated in 1936 clearly stipulates that "laws passed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR shall be published in the languages of the constituent Republics." Article 110 also states that "legal proceedings shall be conducted in the languages of the constituent Republics, Autonomous Republics and Autonomous Regions; and persons who do not understand the common language are guaranteed the right to be fully acquainted with the materials of the case through an interpreter and the right to use their own language in court." Many of the ethnic groups belonging to the Soviet Union also had no writing systems. Therefore, after the success of the revolution in 1917, Soviet linguists designed alphabets, edited grammars and dictionaries for forty ethnic minorities who only had languages but no writing systems. In addition, more than thirty other ethnic groups, mostly Turks and Tatars, adopted simplified alphabets to replace the complex Arabic scripts they had previously used. Some Mongols and Chinese in some areas did the same. This shows how important the current task of Chinese linguists is on this issue. To solve this problem, we must first start by analyzing the writing systems of various ethnic groups. The writing systems of ethnic minorities in China can be roughly divided into the following categories:

　　A. Existing Writing Systems That Do Not Need Improvement or Can Be Improved Later

　　I. Tibetan Script: Tibetan has had written records since the 9th century. Its alphabet was created in the 7th century when Thonmi Sambhota consulted the Devanagari script of India and the Khotanese script, and combined them with the Tibetan phonetic system. Many literary works and Buddhist scriptures are still preserved today. Although Yu Daoquan, Jin Peng, and others have recently proposed a set of Tibetan Latinization schemes, whether they can be improved depends on the wishes of the ethnic group itself.

　　II. Mongolian Script: The Mongolian people adopted the Uyghur script to record their language in the early 13th century. Between the mid-13th century and the mid-14th century, they also created a Phags-pa script derived from Tibetan script as the official script, but it was ultimately not implemented due to its complex form. Since then, the Uyghur script has been used until now. What we now call Mongolian script is actually not significantly different from the original Uyghur script, except that it has more angles when writing, and its lines run from top to bottom, starting from the left. In the 17th century, the Western Mongols supplemented the Uyghur script by adding seven new additional symbols, thus avoiding the inaccuracies of the traditional Uyghur script. The Mongolian People's Republic has now formulated a set of Slavicized new Mongolian script, which is being actively promoted in various parts of Inner Mongolia.

　　III. Manchu Script: The Manchu script was transformed from the Mongolian script originating from Uyghur in the 16th century, and some additional symbols were added later. Apart from these symbols, Manchu and Mongolian scripts are only slightly different in calligraphy. The oldest printing of Manchu script, as far as we know, can be traced back to 1647. Now, the places where the Manchu language is truly prevalent are only in Aihui, Nenjiang, Qiqihar and nearby villages in Heilongjiang Province, as well as Sanchakou, Ning'an, and Yongji in Jilin Province. In addition, a small number of Manchus, Xibe, and Solon who speak Manchu are stationed in Yili, Tacheng, and Dihua in Xinjiang. They are descendants of the garrison troops of the Qing Dynasty. These ethnic groups use Manchu script to write their languages and publish newspapers. Other languages belonging to the Tungusic language family also use Manchu script to some extent.

　　IV. Uyghur Script: Because of their adherence to Islam, the Uyghur people, like other Turkic peoples, use the script of the Quran, in other words, the Arabic script slightly modified by the Persians (before adopting the Arabic script, they also used the Nordic-style Orkhon script and Uyghur script). What is now called Uyghur script is actually this horizontal phonetic script that runs from right to left. Because the letters of this script have different forms when used at the beginning, middle, end, or independently, each letter can have four forms. Vowels are often omitted in spelling. In 1927, the Soviet Union convened a Turkic language conference in Baku, which passed a resolution to abolish the Arabic alphabet and use a Latinized scheme to spell the languages of various ethnic groups. In 1937, Uyghur scholar Yibaode and others also felt that the Arabic alphabet could not fully encompass all the phonemes of the Uyghur language, so they added some additional symbols to remedy the lack of vowels in the Arabic alphabet. Although Latinization was not implemented at that time, the Uyghur script itself became more precise. These additional symbols on vowel letters were also adopted by the Kazakhs. In 1940, the Turkic peoples of Soviet Central Asia abolished the Latin alphabet and adopted a Slavic-style alphabet suitable for the phonetic characteristics of each ethnic group, while not prohibiting the printing of readings written in Arabic-style phonetic alphabets. Now, in addition to the original Uyghur script, the Uyghurs in Xinjiang also have a Slavic-style phonetic script that runs from left to right. In addition, the Uzbek and Tatar ethnic groups of the Turkic language family and the Tajik ethnic group of the Iranian language family of the Indo-European language family also use Uyghur script to spell their own languages. The situation of the Uzbek and Tatar scripts within the Soviet Union is the same as that of the Uyghur script mentioned above.

　　V. Kazakh Script: The so-called Kazakh script is the same as the Uyghur script in form, but slightly different in pronunciation. The Kyrgyz, who are closely related to the Kazakhs, also use Kazakh script. The situation of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz scripts within the Soviet Union is the same as that of the Uyghur script mentioned above, in addition to the Arabic-style Kazakh script, there is also a Slavic-style phonetic script.

　　These various scripts are all systematic phonetic scripts and have a relatively long history. At present, there seems to be no urgent need for reform. If reform is to be carried out, it must wait until the people of their own ethnic groups have a conscious demand before it can be carried out in a step-by-step manner, otherwise it may cause adverse effects. For example, whether the Mongolian script should be reformed must take the same steps as the Mongolian People's Republic and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Whether the Manchu script should exist must be determined after the languages of the Manchu, Xibe, and Solon peoples in Xinjiang and the various Tungusic peoples in Northeast China have been thoroughly investigated. The history of the Tibetan script is relatively long, and more documents have been preserved. Before the liberation of Tibet, influential Tibetans and lamas should be convened for careful consultation before a script policy can be decided. As for the scripts of the ethnic groups belonging to the Turkic language family, they have undergone several reforms themselves. The currently used Arabic-style alphabet runs horizontally from right to left, which is inconsistent with the habits of various scripts in the world, and the scripts of the various ethnic groups have never been standardized. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the All-Union Committee for the Promotion of New Alphabets initially created a set of Latinized alphabets for these ethnic groups using the Arabic script, but later, in response to the requirements of the various ethnic groups, it was changed to a standard Slavic alphabet. If we now want to reform the scripts of the ethnic groups belonging to the Turkic language family in China, we must first see how the people of the ethnic groups themselves consciously demand it, and we must also consider the actual situation of the relevant federations of the Soviet Union. What we need to do now is first to investigate whether the various ethnic groups using Uyghur or Kazakh script can represent the actual phonemes of their own languages, and then standardize and unify them. Second, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission or the Chinese Academy of Sciences should ask the Soviet government and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, through the Soviet Embassy, to donate as many grammars and dictionaries related to the languages of the ethnic groups in northwestern and northeastern China to the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as possible for reference.

　　B. Existing Writing Systems That Need to Be Reformed

　　I. Yi Script: The Yi people have their own independent monosyllabic script, but its form is complex and difficult, and it is only used for classics. Only a few shamans called "Bimo" can understand it, and it cannot be popularized among the people. The current Yi stone inscriptions are no earlier than the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. In the early 20th century, Pan’Uial, a French Catholic priest living in Lunan, Yunnan, proposed a set of phonetic scripts for the Sani language, but it was not precise enough. Recently, Fu Maoji, Ma Xueliang, Gao Huanian, Chen Shilin, and others have each proposed a set of phonetic schemes for the Yi language in the Greater Liang Mountains, Yunnan, and other places. Yuan Jiahua has also analyzed the phonetic systems of Honi and Axi. In the future, various schemes can be combined to create a unified scheme, and then tested in the Yi areas for supplementation and revision. For the Lisu language belonging to this branch, F.O. Frozer, a British missionary, also created a so-called Lisu script, which was later revised by Luo Changpei, Rui Yifu, Zhao Yuying, and others, and can also be used as a basis for experimentation.

　　II. Naxi Script or Mosuo Script: The Naxi people have created two types of scripts: one is pictographic, called "Doba script," and the other is phonetic, called "Geba script." These two scripts have been compiled into two dictionaries by Li Lincan, Zhang Kun, and He Cai respectively, and published by the former Central Museum in 1944 and 1945. However, these two scripts are still for the Naxi shamans "Doba" and cannot serve the people. Recently, Ma Xueliang and Li Yaoshang are jointly drafting a new scheme for a phonetic script.

　　III. Tai Script: Most of the languages belonging to the Kam-Tai language family in China do not have their own scripts. Only some parts of Yunnan use the Shan script transformed from Burmese, or the Southern Tai alphabet transformed from Siamese. Now, we should not only create phonetic scripts for the ethnic groups without scripts, but also improve the scripts that borrow Shan or Southern Tai alphabets. Regarding this work, Luo Changpei has drafted a scheme for the Paiyi language in western Yunnan, Xing Gongwan has drafted a unified scheme for the Tai-Zhong language, Li Fanggui has analyzed the Mak language family, and Chen Shuyong and Yu Shichang have engaged in the investigation and research of the Gelao language. In addition, there is also a phonetic script scheme for the Zhuang language drafted by Wei Qingwen (a Zhuang). Li Fanggui and Zhang Kun have collected a lot of Tai language materials, but unfortunately they are not in China now, and we can only hope to get in touch with them through correspondence.

　　IV. Miao Script: The Miao people originally had no script. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, S. Pollard, a British missionary, proposed a so-called Miao script (Pollard Script), which is very similar to the Zhuyin alphabet and is not easily accepted by the people. Recently, Ma Xueliang and Wang Fushi are preparing to formulate a phonetic script scheme for the Miao language. In addition, Zhang Kun, Chen Sansu, and others have also conducted investigations on the Miao language.

　　V. Jingpho Script: The Jingpho people originally had no script. In the early 20th century, O. Hanson, a British missionary, proposed a set of phonetic scripts for the Jingpho language and compiled a dictionary. The British used this script to print many books and newspapers as tools for cultural aggression. Not only did the Jingpho people use it, but also the Achang, Lashi, and other ethnic groups on the Yunnan-Burma border also used it in disguise. In 1943, Luo Changpei, after three months of investigation and research, corrected Hanson's shortcomings and proposed another phonetic scheme, which can be experimented and promoted in the Jingpho area after further revision.

　　The items listed in this section include traditional scripts that serve the privileged class, and not very accurate phonetic scripts formulated by imperialist missionaries. They all need to be reformed now. In addition to the various scripts mentioned above that have already undergone preliminary investigation and research or have draft phonetic script schemes, we should also step up investigation and research on the Zhongjia, Shui, Yanghuang, Nong, Sa, Kam, and Li languages of the Tai family, and the Akha, Lolo, and other languages of the Yi family, and formulate phonetic schemes separately, and then link them with the various scripts mentioned above according to linguistic affiliation, and create unified schemes separately. In this way, the culture of the various ethnic groups will undoubtedly develop very rapidly.

　　C. Those Who Have No Writing Systems and Need to Create New Ones

　　I. Wa-Palaung Languages: Our past knowledge of the Kawa, Riang, and Palaung languages belonging to the Mon-Khmer group of the Austro-Asiatic language family is very insufficient. Kawa and Riang are now distributed in the area called Wa States by the British, which is the so-called "Hulu King Area" in the old chronicles. It is bounded by the Nujiang River in the west and the watershed between the Nujiang River and the Mekong River in the east, and the north and south boundaries are between 22 and 24 degrees north latitude. Palaung is distributed in the far west of Yunnan, west of 99 degrees east longitude, and south of 25 degrees north latitude. Regarding the linguistic knowledge of these ethnic groups, in addition to some vocabularies recorded in H.R. Davies's Yunnan and G.A. Grieson's Linguistic Survey of India, there is also Mrs Leslie Milne's An Elementary Palaung Gram-mar Oxford 1921. During the Anti-Japanese War, we were unable to conduct in-depth investigations due to inconvenient transportation and because these ethnic groups still maintained the primitive custom of "headhunting." In the future, with the assistance of the People's Government and the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, we will surely have satisfactory results.

　　II. Pumi Language: The Pumi, also known as "Puman" or Prinmi. In the past, the Pumi were distributed in a wide area, but recently, due to faster assimilation, the area has been shrinking. According to the Qing Zhigong Tu Shuo: "The Pu people are the Puman, traditionally said to be descendants of the Baiyue and Miao. Before the Song Dynasty, they did not communicate with China. They first became attached during the Taiding period of the Yuan Dynasty, with the local chieftain Meng as the prefect. This continued in the early Ming Dynasty. During the Xuande period, the Tusi system was abolished, and officials were appointed by the central government. Now, the seven prefectures of Shunning, Zhenjiang, Zhenyuan, Puer, Chuxiong, Yongchang, and Jingdong have this kind of people." This ethnic group is not only assimilated into the Han, but also assimilated into the Paiyi, so some people mistakenly regard the Pumi language as a kind of Paiyi. According to Davies's report and what Ling Chunsheng saw of the Pumi in Mengyun, Yunnan, their language, physique, and culture are similar to those of the Kawa. Their original residence was between the Lancang River and the Nujiang River, south of 27 degrees north latitude. Later, they moved east and southeast across the Lancang River. When we were in Yunnan before, we did not obtain reliable materials on the language and writing systems of this ethnic group. In the future, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations.

　　III. Yao Language: The Yao people are distributed in the mountainous areas of western Guangdong, southern Guizhou, and many places in Guangxi and Yunnan. Their language is greatly influenced by Chinese and Tai languages, and some dialects simply adopt Chinese or Tai languages. The Yao language has no writing system of its own, except for occasionally borrowing Chinese characters. The Guangs Yao folk songs recorded by Zhao Yuanren contain too many Chinese characters. To create a phonetic script for them, a systematic investigation is needed.

　　IV. Qiang and Nusu Languages: The Qiang and Nusu are distributed in the Gaoligong Mountains and the Jiangxinpo area in the northwestern corner of Yunnan. Their languages have some similarities with the Nepali dialects of the Himalayan family. Neither of these languages has a writing system. In the spring of 1942, Luo Changpei conducted a preliminary investigation, and the materials obtained were sufficient as a basis for formulating a phonetic script.

　　V. Minjia Language: The Minjia are distributed in several counties along the coast of Erhai Lake in Yunnan Province. Regarding the linguistic affiliation of them, some say it belongs to the Mon-Khmer, and some say it belongs to the Tai family. According to our investigation and research, we believe that it is a mixture of Yi and Chinese languages. This language contains 70% of Chinese components, and the rest, in addition to Yi, is mixed with some other language components, so everyone feels confused about its affiliation. This language has no writing system of its own. The "Ciji Shanhua Stele" stored in the Shengyuan Temple in Dali uses Chinese characters to record the Minjia language. In 1941, Luo Changpei conducted a systematic investigation of this language, and the materials obtained can be made into a unified scheme for Minjia script.

　　VI. Aboriginal Languages: During the period of Japanese rule in Taiwan, they tried their best to eliminate the languages of the Taiwanese aborigines and forced them to speak Japanese. Of course, they would not formulate writing systems for them. It is said that this language is similar to the Malay language of the Austronesian language family, but it has not been actually investigated and studied by us. Before the liberation of Taiwan, we hope to get the help of the Nationalities Affairs Commission to invite the aboriginal speakers in Beijing, so that we can prepare the writing tools, so that this long-oppressed brotherly nation by imperialism and feudal remnants can obtain cultural liberation at the same time when they are politically liberated.

　　D. Those Who Have No Writing Systems and Do Not Need to Create New Ones

　　In addition to the ethnic groups listed in item C who have no writing systems, there are also some small ethnic groups, either because the number of people is too small or because they can be incorporated into other ethnic groups, there is no need to create new writing systems for them. For example, the Salar scattered in Xunhua and Hualong counties in Qinghai Province and within the Jishi Pass west of Linxia in Gansu is actually a dialect of the Turkic language. The number of people who speak this language is also very small, so it should be handled in the same way as other Turkic languages, and there is no need to create a new script. There are also more than 2,000 Dongxiang people scattered in Linxia, Ninding, and Zheng, Shuijing counties in Gansu who believe in Islam and speak Mongolian. This should be handled in the same way as other ethnic groups who speak Mongolian. The small ethnic groups in the Northeast who belong to the Tungusic language family but do not use Manchu script should be treated in the same way as the Manchu, Xibe, and Solon ethnic groups. In addition, Qinghai, western Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan all have so-called "Tu ethnic groups." This is just a general term used by local people for ethnic groups whose affiliations are unclear. We should investigate clearly and classify them according to linguistic affiliation, and there is no need to create new writing systems for them.

　　国内少数民族的语言系属和文字情况
    中国科学院语言研究所所长  罗常培
            （一）少数民族的语言系属
    国内各少数民族的种类，按旧日方志的记载和本地人的称谓，的确名目繁多，听着令人迷惑。实际上要照语言的系属来分类，也不过是三系、七族、十九支；每支下所属的语言，不过是同支异派的方言罢了：
    甲、汉藏语系
    一、黔台语族（或称峝台语族），主要分布在广西、云南、贵州、海南岛等处。
    １黔水语支—Ａ黔语  Ｂ水语  Ｃ莫语  Ｄ羊黄语
    ２台语支—Ａ僮语（侬语）  Ｂ仲家（土语）  Ｃ牢语（仡佬、土佬、木佬）  Ｄ台语（摆彝、掸语、吕语、沙语）  Ｅ黎语
    二、苗徭语族，主要分布在湘西山地、广西、贵州、云南和广东西部山地。
    １苗语支
    ２徭语支
    三、藏缅语族，主要分布在西藏、西康、四川、青海、云南、贵州等处。
    １藏语支—Ａ西部方言（巴拉地、拉打克）Ｂ中部方言（拉萨）  Ｃ东部方言（西康、嘉戎）  Ｄ俅、怒语。
    ２山头语支（或称卡亲语支）
    ３缅语支—Ａ茶山语  Ｂ浪速语
    ４彝语支—Ａ彝语（纳苏、傈僳、倮黑、撒尼、阿细、阿卡、窝尼等）Ｂ拿喜语（么?）  Ｃ民家语（僰、白子、那玛）  （附）
    乙、南亚语系
    一、猛吉蔑族，主要分布在云南极西的所谓“葫芦王区”，和澜沧江与怒江之间，北纬二十七度以南。
    １瓦崩龙语支—Ａ崩龙语  Ｂ卡拉语  Ｃ卡瓦语
    ２濮语支（或称本人）
    （附注）台湾高山族的语言，有人说属于南岛语系，在没经过调查研究得出确定结论以前，暂且附列在这里。
    丙、阿尔泰语系
    一、突厥语族，主要分布在新疆的大部分，蒙古西北角和甘肃的一部分。
    １唐努乌梁海语支—在国内的只有撒拉语
    ２维吾尔语支—Ａ维吾尔语  Ｂ乌孜别克语  Ｃ塔塔尔语
    ３哈萨克语支—Ａ哈萨克语  Ｂ柯尔吉斯语
    （附注）分布在新疆南部蒲犁县境内的塔吉克语属于印欧语系的伊兰语族，并不属于阿尔泰语系。
    二、蒙古语族，在国内主要分布在内蒙古、新疆及华北各省。
    １东部和南部方言
    ２喀尔喀语支
    ３喀尔玛克语支
    ４布利亚特语支
    三、通古斯语族，在国内主要分布在内蒙古、黑龙江的东北角和松花江的下游。
    １南支—Ａ满洲语  Ｂ锡伯语  Ｃ索伦语  Ｄ达呼尔语  Ｅ赫哲语
    ２北支—Ａ鄂伦春语  Ｂ玛涅克尔语  Ｃ毕拉尔语
    从上面的分类来看，一向传说很复杂的民族，照语言的系统来区别，仅仅归纳成这些族属，还不到“纷不可理”的程度。不过这里所归纳的只是初步的意见，要想精确分析还有继续调查研究的必要。
            （二）少数民族的文字情况
    按照共同纲领的民族政策“各少数民族均有发展其语言文字，保持或改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由。人民政府应帮助各少数民族的人民大众发展其政治、经济、文化、教育的建设事业”（第五十三条），咱们要想帮助各少数民族发展种种建设事业，首先就得研究他们的语言文字。斯大林说：“少数民族并不是不满意于缺乏民族联盟，而是不满意于缺乏本族语言使用权。当他们一旦拥有本族语言使用权时，这种不满就会自然消失下去的了”。不过要使各族语言发挥广大的作用帮助提高大众文化水平，尤其需要记录口语的文字。在上面所举的各种民族语言里有自造文字的占极少数，大多数都没有文字，这对于发展文化教育以至于政治、经济等建设事业是有绝大阻力的。苏联自十月革命成功新政府建立后，就确定各少数民族间自己使用其语言文字。在一九三六年颁布的新宪法第四十条明白规定着：“全国苏维埃通过的法案用各种语言发表。”第一一○条也说：“法律程序要以各种语言发表，如各联邦共和国，各自治共和国或各自治区有不能了解普通语言的人们，保证在任何机会把案情给他们明白的译述，并可以用自己的语言在法庭上说话。”苏联所属的各民族也有很多是没有文字的，因此苏联的语言学者自一九一七年革命成功后就为四十个只有语言而无文字的少数民族设计了字母，编辑了文法和字典。此外还有三十种以上的民族，大多数是土耳其、鞑靼人，改用了简明字母来代替他们从前使用的繁难的阿剌伯文，有些地方的蒙古人和中国人也如此。由此可见中国语言学者对于这个问题的当前任务是怎样重要了。我们要解决这个问题先得从分析各民族的文字情况开始。国内各少数民族的文字情况大约可分下列几项来说明：
    甲、已有文字无须改进或从缓改进者
    一、藏文  西藏语从第九世纪起就有文字记载，它的字母是第七世纪时通密伞布剌参酌印度的天城书跟和阗字母，配合西藏的语音系统，制造成功的。有很多的文学作品和佛经现在还都保存着。最近于道泉、金鹏等虽然各自拟了一套藏语拉丁化方案，可是能否改进要看本民族的意思来决定。
    二、蒙文  蒙古族从十三世纪初才采用回纥文来记录自己的语言。在十三世纪中叶到十四世纪中叶之间，他们也曾经创造了一种从藏文演变来的巴思八文作官方文字，终于因为形体繁难，没能实行。从此以后，仍然沿用回纥文一直到现在。咱们现在所谓蒙古文，实际上与原来的回纥文并没有重要的区别，不过写起来角度多些，而且它的行款是从上到下，由左边起头儿罢了。十七世纪中西蒙古人曾经把回纥文补充过一次，他们增加了七个新的附加符号，传统回纥文的不精确地方，因此得以避免。现在蒙古人民共和国制订了一套斯拉夫化的新蒙文，内蒙各处也在积极地推行着。
    三、满文  满洲文字是十六世纪时从源出回纥的蒙古文改造成的，后来又添加了一些附加符号。除了这些符号以外，满蒙文只在书法上不大一样罢了。满文最古的印刷，就现在所知道的可以推溯到一六四七年。现在真正满洲话流行的地方只在黑龙江省爱珲、嫩江、齐齐哈尔等城和附近的村落，还有吉林省的三姓、宁安、永吉一带。此外还有一小部分说满洲话的满洲、锡伯、索伦各族，分驻在新疆的伊犁、塔城、迪化各地，那都是清朝屯戍部队的后裔。这些民族都用满文书写他们的语言，并发行报纸。其他属于通古斯族的语言也有一部分用满文。
    四、维文  维吾尔族因为信奉回教的缘故，跟其他突厥族一样，都采用可兰经的文字，换言之，就是经过波斯人略加增改的阿剌伯文（在采用阿剌伯文以前他们也曾经用过北欧式的鄂尔浑文和回纥文）。现在所谓维文实际就是这种自右而左的横行拼音文字。这种文字的字母因为用在字首、字间、字尾或独立而形式不同，所以每个字母可以有四种写法。拼音中往往在元音方面有所省略。一九二七年苏联在巴库台召开了一个突厥语系大会，会中通过了废弃阿剌伯字母改用拉丁化方案拚写各民族语言的议案。一九三七年维族易包德等五人也感觉阿剌伯字母不能完全包括维族所有的语音，增加了一些附加符号来补救阿文字母元音的缺乏。那时虽然没有实行拉丁化，可是维文本身比较精密些了。这些元音字母上的附加符号同时也为哈萨克诸族所采用。一九四○年苏联中亚突厥语系诸民族又废弃了拉丁字母改用适合各族语音特征的斯拉夫式字母，同时还没有禁止用阿拉伯式拼音字母写印的读物。现在新疆的维族除了原有的维文以外也还有一套斯拉夫式的自左而右的拼音文字。此外突厥语族的乌孜别克、塔塔尔两族和印欧语系伊兰语族的塔吉克族也都用维文拚写他们自己的语言。苏联境内的乌、塔两族文字跟上述维文的情形相同。
    五、哈文  所谓哈文跟维文形式上是一样的，只是发音上略有不同。跟哈萨克族相近的柯尔吉斯族也通用哈文。苏联境内的哈、柯两族文字也跟上面所说维文情形一样，在阿剌伯式的哈文以外还有一套斯拉夫式的拼音文字。
    此项各种文字本身都是有系统的拼音文字，而且各有相当长久的历史，目前似乎还不怎样迫切的需要改革。如果要改革必须等待他们本族人民有了自觉的要求，才能有步骤的进行，否则反而可能引起不好的影响。比方说蒙文应否改革得要跟蒙古人民共和国和内蒙自治区取一致的步骤，满文应否存在得要把新疆的满洲、锡伯、索伦三族以及东北各种通古斯族语言调查清楚才能决定。藏文的历史比较最长久，文献也保留的较多，在西藏解放前应当召集藏族有威望的人士和喇嘛慎重协商，才可以决定文字政策。至于突厥语族所属各民族的文字自己已然经过好几次改革，现在通用的阿剌伯式字母横行自右至左，跟世界各种文字的习惯不合，而且各族间的文字始终也没有定型化。苏联十月革命以后全苏联邦新字母推行委员会起初曾经给这些使用阿剌伯文的民族造了一套拉丁化字母，后来为应合各民族的要求，又改成标准的斯拉夫式字母。咱们现在要想改革国内突厥语族所属的各民族文字首先得要看本族人民自觉要求如何，并且还得斟酌苏联有关各联邦的实际情况。我们当前所要作的事，第一先得调查使用维文或哈文的各民族是否能代表他们自己语言的实际语音，然后加以定型化和统一化。第二应该由文委或科学院通过苏联大使馆或苏联对外文化协会，要求苏联政府和科学院把所有跟中国西北、东北各民族语言有关的文法、字典、尽量赠送我国科学院语言研究所，以资参考。
    乙、已有文字而需要改革者
    一、彝文  彝族自己有独立的单音节文字，不过形体繁难，专用于经典，只有少数的巫师“毕摩”能够懂，并不能通行于人民大众。现在的彝文石刻没有早过明朝嘉靖以前的。二十世纪初年，住在云南路南的法国天主教神父邓明德（Pan’Uial）曾经拟了一套撒尼语的拼音文字，但是还不够精确。最近傅懋绩、马学良、高华年、陈士林等对于大凉山、云南等处的彝语各自拟了一套拚音方案，袁家骅也分析过窝尼和阿细的语音系统，将来可以把各种方案集合起来作成一套汇通方案，然后再拿到彝区实验，加以补充修订。这一支所属的傈僳语从前英国传教士傅能仁（F.O.Frozer）也造过一套所谓傈僳文，后来经罗常培、芮逸夫、赵毓英等加以修正，将来也可作为实验的根据。
    二、拿喜文或称摩?文  拿喜族自造的两种文字：一种象形的叫“多巴字”，一种表音的叫“哥巴字”。这两种文字已经由李霖灿、张琨、和才三人合作分别编成两部字典，于一九四四、一九四五两年先后由前中央博物院出版。不过这两种文字还都是为拿喜族的巫师“多巴”用的，并不能给人民大众服务。最近马学良跟李耀商合作正在起草一种拼音文字的新方案。
    三、台文  中国境内属于黔台语族的各种语言多数没有自己的文字，只有在云南的一部分或者用从缅文变来的掸文，或者用从暹文变来的南泰字母。现在我们不单对于没文字的各族应该赶造拼音文字，就是对于借用掸文或南泰字母的也有从事改良的必要。关于这部分工作，罗常培已经拟有滇西摆彝语方案，邢公畹已经拟有台仲语汇通方案，李方桂已经分析了莫语言系，陈舒永、喻世长已经从事仡佬语的调查研究，另外还有韦庆稳（僮族人）自拟的僮语拼音方案。李方桂、张琨所搜集的台语材料很多，可惜他们现在不在国内，只能希望从通信中取得联系。
    四、苗文  苗族本来没有文字，清朝末年英国传教士柏应理（S.Pollard）曾经拟了一套所谓苗文（Pollard Script），形象很近于注音字母，不容易为人民大众所接受。最近马学良、王辅世都在从事拟定苗语拼音方案的准备。此外张琨、陈三苏等也曾经作过苗语的调查工作。
    五、山头文   山头族本来没有文字，二十世纪初年英国传教士韩孙（O.Hanson）曾经拟了一套山头语的拼音文字，并且编有字典。英国人就利用这套文字印了好些书报作为文化侵略的工具，不单山头族应用它，就是附近滇缅边境上的茶山、浪速等族也都变相的使用它。一九四三年罗常培经过三个月的调查研究，改正韩孙的缺点，曾经另拟了一套拼音方案，再度修正后就可到山头区实验推行。
    这一项所列举的，有的是为特权阶级服务的传统文字，有的是帝国主义传教士所制定的不很精确的拼音文字，他们现在都有改革的必要。除了上面所说已然经过初步调查研究或者已然拟有拼音文字草案的以外，咱们对于台族的仲家、水户、羊黄、侬、沙、黔、黎等语，彝族的阿卡、倮黑等语，还得加紧调查研究，分别拟定拼音方案，然后再按语言系属跟上面所举各种文字联系，分别作成汇通方案。这样一来，各族的文化无疑地就可以很迅速地发展了。
    丙、本无文字须另造新文字者
    一、瓦崩龙语  属于南亚语系猛吉蔑族的卡瓦、卡拉、崩龙等语，我们过去的知识很不充分。卡瓦、卡拉现在分布在英人所谓卡瓦地（Wa States），也就是旧志所谓“葫芦王区”。西以怒江，东以怒江跟湄公河的分水岭为界，南北界限在北纬二十二度至二十四度之间。崩龙分布在云南的极西，东经九十九度以西，北纬二十五度以南一带。关于这些民族的语言知识我们除了英人戴维斯（H.R.Davies）云南和葛利尔孙（G.A.Grieson）印度语言调查（LinguisticSurvey of India）里所记的一些词汇外，还有米邻（Mrs Leslie Milne）所著的一本崩龙文法初步（An Elementary Palaung Gram-mar Oxford 1921）。抗日时期我们因为交通不便，又因为这些民族还保持“猎首”的原始风俗，所以没能深入调查。今后靠着人民政府以及西南民族事务委员会协助，一定会使我们有满意的收获。
    二、濮语  濮族或称“蒲蛮”也叫作本人。从前濮族分布的区域很广，近来因为同化较快，区域也日见缩小。据清职贡图说：“蒲人即蒲蛮，相传为百濮苗裔，宋以前不通中国。元泰定间始内附，以土酋猛氏为知府，明初因之，宣德中改土归流，今顺宁、征江、镇沅、普洱、楚雄、永昌、景东等七府有此种。”这种民族不单同化于汉人，也同化于摆彝，所以有人把濮语误认作摆彝的一种。据戴维斯的报告和凌纯声在云南猛允所见的濮人，他们的语言？体质和文化都跟卡瓦相近。他们原住的区域在澜沧江与怒江之间，北纬二十七度以南。后来越过澜沧江向东及东南移殖。我们以前在云南时对于这一族的语言文字都没有得到可靠的材料，今后有深入调查的必要。
    三、徭语  徭族分布在广东西部山地、贵州南部和广西、云南许多地方。他们的语言受汉语和台语的影响很大，有些方言简直采取汉语或台语。徭语除去偶然借用汉字外，自己并没有文字。赵元任所作的广西徭歌记音包含汉字的成份太多，要给他们造拼音文字还须经过系统的调查。
    四、俅语和怒语  俅子和怒子分布在云南西北角高黎贡山和江心坡一带地方。他们的语言跟喜马拉亚系的尼泊尔方言有些类似的地方。这两种语言都没有文字。一九四二年春天罗常培曾经作过初步的调查，所得材料尽够作拟订拚音文字的根据。
    五、民家语  民家族分布在云南省洱海沿岸的几县，关于他们的语言系属，有的说属于猛吉蔑族，有的说属于台语支，据我们调查研究的结果认为它是彝语和汉语的混合物。这种语言含有百分之七十的汉语成份，其余的除了彝语以外还掺杂着一些别种语言成份，所以大家对于它的系属感觉混淆不清。这种语言并没有自己的文字，在大理圣源寺所存的“祠记山花碑”就是用汉字来记录民家语的。一九四一年罗常培曾经对这种语言作过一番系统的调查，所得材料可以作成一种民家文字的汇通方案。
    六、高山语  台湾的高山族在日本统治时期尽量想消灭他们的语言，强迫他们改说日本话，当然更不会给他们制订文字了。这种语言据说跟南岛语系的马来语类似，不过还没经过我们实际的调查研究。在台湾解放以前我们希望得到民族委员会的帮助，替我们约请在京的高山族发音人，好让我们准备好了文字工具，使这种久被帝国主义和封建残余压迫的兄弟民族在政治得到解放的时候，同时也可得到文化解放。
    丁、本无文字并无须另造文字者
    除了丙项所举本无文字的民族以外，还有些个小民族，或者人数太少或者可以并入其他族属，就没有给他们另造文字的必要了。例如散布在青海的循化、化隆两县境内和甘肃临夏西边积石关以内的撒拉族实际就是突厥语的一种方言，说这种话的人数也很少，就应该跟其他各种突厥语一律办理，无须另造文字。还有甘肃临夏、宁定、和政、水靖等县散布着一种东乡族只有两千多人，信回教，说蒙古话，这就应该跟其他说蒙古话的民族一律办理。东北属于通古斯族而不用满文的各小民族，应该跟满州、锡伯、索伦等族同样处理。此外青海、湘西、贵州、云南都有所谓“土族”，这只是当地人对于这种民族系属分不清楚的一种笼统的称呼，我们应该分别调查清楚了，按照语言的系属各归其类，不必给他们另造新文字。
