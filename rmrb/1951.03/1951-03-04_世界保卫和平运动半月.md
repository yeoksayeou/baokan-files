　　Stalin's Great Call
    Amidst the tense international situation created by the war-mongering elements' conspiracy to expand the war, at a time when the world's forces for peace are engaged in a fierce struggle with the forces of aggression, Stalin, the helmsman of the world's peace and democracy camp, delivered an important speech on the current international situation. Stalin's speech thoroughly exposed the schemes and intrigues of the American and British aggressor forces to deceive the people and drag them into a new war, and clearly pointed out the path to victory for the forces of peace over the forces of aggression. He told the people of all countries that if the people take up the cause of defending peace and defend it to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. Stalin's great call, in a profound sense and on a vast scale, mobilized the people of all countries to actively participate in the struggle to defend world peace, and greatly boosted their confidence in victory. The people of the Soviet Union, China, the people's democracies, as well as the capitalist countries and colonies and dependencies, all supported Stalin's speech with great enthusiasm and took Stalin's instructions on how to prevent a new war as their program of action.
            The Great Achievements of the First Session of the World Peace Council
    The first session of the World Peace Council, held in Berlin from February 21st, successfully concluded on February 26th. With the support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, this conference achieved great success.
    After discussing the implementation of the program of the Second World Peace Congress, the current international situation, and how to strengthen the movement to defend peace and other important issues, the meeting unanimously adopted ten documents: “Resolution on the United Nations,” “Declaration on the Conclusion of a Peace Pact,” “Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the German Question,” “Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the Japanese Question,” “Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question,” “Resolution on the Unjust Decision of the United Nations to Condemn the People's Republic of China as an 'Aggressor' in Korea,” “Resolution on Organizational Issues,” “Resolution on the Struggle of Colonies and Dependencies for Peace,” “Resolution on 'Peace' Magazine,” and “Resolution on International Peace Prizes.” These ten documents are an extremely great contribution to the world movement for the defense of peace made by this conference. This fully proves that the Peace Council, elected by the representatives of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people, has become a powerful organization capable of realizing the peace aspirations of the people of the world, and has in fact gained the trust of the people that the United Nations has already lost.
    The resolutions of the first session of the World Peace Council solemnly condemned the United Nations for disregarding the "Appeal to the United Nations," which expressed the will of the peace-loving people of the world, and condemned the United Nations for illegally passing the shameful decision to falsely accuse the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor." The World Peace Council decided to send representatives to the United Nations to request the United Nations to consider the recommendations in the "Appeal to the United Nations" and the resolutions of this conference, and to request the United Nations to restore the tasks stipulated in the United Nations Charter and not to act as a tool of any dominant group.
    The declaration of the World Peace Council has stipulated the main task for the world peace advocates – to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and to call on all good people and all groups who desire peace in the world to sign in support of this declaration. As Nenni said, this declaration "will help to save the world from the danger of a new war and unite all those who do not want war around it."
    The resolutions of the conference demanded a peaceful solution to the German and Japanese questions, demanded the convening of a conference of all relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean question, and demanded that the United Nations cancel the illegal decision to falsely accuse the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor."
    The historic declaration and resolutions of the first session of the World Peace Council have been unanimously endorsed and enthusiastically supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The peace fighters of all countries will take these resolutions as the basis for their future activities, and more broadly mobilize the people of the world to participate in the movement to defend peace and stop imperialism from persisting in aggression and rearming West Germany and Japan, and will push this movement to a higher stage.
            Oppose Imperialist Enslavement of Colonies
    February 21st was the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," and the democratic youth of the world unanimously commemorated this festival by strengthening their combat actions against imperialist aggression.
    Youth of all circles and ethnic groups in more than 30 major cities in our country held grand rallies and demonstrations on this day to protest against the aggression of American imperialism. The young masses who participated in the rallies and demonstrations all unanimously expressed their determination to continue to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in defeating the American aggressors, oppose the American rearmament of Japan, and support the struggle of the oppressed nations of the East against colonialism with the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. At the same time, the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent letters to the youth of Asian countries, calling on them to unite to oppose imperialist rule and American aggression. This will be a major encouragement to the struggle of the people of Asian countries against imperialist aggression and for national liberation.
    Nguyen Chi Thanh, Chairman of the Vietnam Youth Federation, issued a statement on "February 21," calling on Vietnamese youth to work hard in production, actively join the army, and intensify their studies to fight to defeat French imperialism and American interventionists.
    On this day, the All-India Students' Federation sent telegrams to the Chinese youth and Soviet youth to pay tribute, guaranteeing to further strengthen the friendship between Chinese-Indian and Soviet-Indian youth, and expressed the determination of Indian youth to fight against imperialist aggression and defend world peace.
    Japanese youth, Burmese youth, and Indonesian youth also held grand rallies. They firmly expressed their determination to fight against colonialism, stop the imperialist plot to provoke a world war, and defend world peace. In particular, the Japanese youth held rallies under the heavy obstruction of the American occupation authorities and the Japanese reactionary government. They firmly opposed the collusion between the Japanese reactionary government and the American aggressor army in Korea, opposed the colonization of Japan, and opposed the signing of a unilateral peace treaty and rearmament.
    In Bucharest, the capital of Romania, young people held a commemorative meeting and sent a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, expressing that the Romanian youth are connected with the sacred cause of the people of various colonies to break free from the oppression of the colonial system.
            The Movement Against American Rearmament of Japan Continues to Surge
    The movement against the American rearmament of Japan has become the focus of the struggle for peace by the Chinese people, including the Japanese people, and the people of Asia.
    The patriotic movement of the Chinese people to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the American rearmament of Japan is now unfolding universally. Many cities and some rural areas in the country have successively held demonstration rallies against the American rearmament of Japan and rallies to denounce the crimes of the Japanese invaders. Workers, peasants, students, industrialists and businessmen, religious people, and returned overseas Chinese have actively participated in this anti-American patriotic movement. The people of the whole country have fresh memories of the enormous trauma inflicted on our country by Japanese imperialism. The old blood debts have not yet been repaid, and American imperialism is even attempting to re-support Japanese militarists to launch aggression again. This is absolutely intolerable to us Chinese people. This vigorous anti-American patriotic movement of our Chinese people has seriously hit the conspiracy plans of American imperialism and its Japanese running dogs, and at the same time has powerfully supported the patriotic struggle of the Japanese people against rearmament. The All-Japan Industry-Specific Labor Union Conference's letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 27 clearly expressed their gratitude for the support of the Chinese people. They firmly stated in their letter: "The Japanese people are determined not to fight against the Chinese people again, but to fight to the end against the imperialists and their running dogs who want to make the people of China and Japan kill each other and benefit from it." The great power of the unity of the Chinese and Japanese people will give the greatest blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism to rearm Japan.
    The signature campaign demanding a comprehensive peace treaty is being carried out in various parts of Japan and has achieved considerable results. According to Kazuo Kawamura, the Japanese representative attending the World Peace Council, various democratic parties and democratic groups have launched a campaign to collect 10 million signatures. The youth symposium of the "Shibaura Employment Security Office" in Tokyo began collecting signatures on January 17, and had collected more than 1,500 signatures by the 25th. The housewives of the Mineoka Housing Dormitory of the Hodogaya Factory in Yokohama collected more than 700 signatures in a very short period of time. Even at a current affairs lecture meeting held by Hitoshi Ashida, a reactionary leader who advocated fascist war, on February 4 in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, half of the audience refused his instigation and signed their names on the vote for a comprehensive peace treaty.
    Democratic groups, progressive trade union organizations, and citizens in various parts of Japan have combined the great task of "striving for a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing rearmament" with the struggle for democracy and the rights to life. The fourth provisional meeting of the Japan National Council of Government and Public Corporation Workers' Unions, held in Tokyo on January 25, unanimously passed a resolution demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing rearmament. The Central Committee of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, overcoming the conspiracy of splitters, decided to include "opposing rearmament" in its struggle policy. The Central Committee meeting of the Japan Teachers' Union, held in Tokyo on January 25, issued a statement pointing out that the Central Committee "reaffirmed the historical mission of 500,000 teachers and decided to combine all struggles with the struggle for demanding a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing rearmament." In Kanagawa Prefecture, the Youth Women's Department of the Shipbuilding Trade Union Branch decided at its meeting on January 13 to combine the struggle to increase wages with the struggle against rearmament.
    The first session of the World Peace Council has adopted the "Resolution on the Peaceful Settlement of the Japanese Question." This resolution is fully in line with the interests of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the Japanese people, and it will surely become the common struggle program of the Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world against the American rearmament of Japan.
            Unified Action of the European Working Class
    The working class, which occupies a leading position in the European movement to defend peace, has fully realized that in order to completely defeat the conspiracy plan of the United States to arm West Germany and launch a new war, the working classes of European countries must unite and act in unison. The workers of the "Gasperhutte" Metallurgical Factory in West Germany took the lead in proposing the convening of a European Workers' Congress in order to further launch the struggle against the American conspiracy to rearm West Germany. This proposal quickly received a warm response from various enterprises in West Germany. The joint meeting of workers' representatives from France and Germany established a preparatory committee based on this proposal, calling on workers from European countries to hold a European Workers' Congress in Berlin from March 23 to 25 this year to discuss the "unified action of the working people and trade unions of European countries against the remilitarization of Germany."
    The signature campaign against the rearmament of West Germany in various parts of France has developed greatly. In the first ten days of February alone, 2 million people in 35 provinces voted against the American rearmament of West Germany. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party also passed a resolution on February 15, calling on all party members to participate in the signature campaign protesting against the arming of West Germany and opposing the American conspiracy to "turn Germany into a second Korea tomorrow to expand the war." The demonstration parade of 75,000 people in the capital of the Netherlands on February 25 to protest against the rearmament of Germany was jointly led by the Dutch Communist Party and the "February Strike Commemoration Committee." These powerful and extensive actions have fully demonstrated that the movement against the American arming of West Germany has become the center of the European people's movement to defend peace.

　　世界保卫和平运动半月
    斯大林的伟大号召
    在战争贩子阴谋扩大战争所造成的紧张的国际局势当中，在世界和平力量正和侵略势力进行着激烈的搏斗的时刻，世界和平民主阵营的舵手斯大林，就当前国际形势发表了重要的谈话。斯大林的谈话，彻底地揭露了美、英侵略势力欺骗人民并把他们拖入新战争的阴谋诡计，清楚地指出了和平力量战胜侵略势力的胜利道路。他告诉世界各国人民，如果人民把维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。斯大林这一伟大的号召，在极深刻的意义上和极广大的规模上动员了世界各国人民积极参加保卫世界和平的斗争，并大大地振奋了他们的胜利信心。苏联、中国、各人民民主国家以至各资本主义国家和殖民地、附属国的人民，都以极兴奋的心情拥护斯大林的谈话，并把斯大林关于如何制止新战争的指示当作他们的行动纲领。
            世界和平理事会第一届会议的伟大成就
    自二月二十一日起在柏林举行的世界和平理事会第一届会议，已于二月二十六日胜利闭幕。在全世界亿万爱好和平人民的支持下，这次会议获得了伟大的成就。
    会议在讨论了第二届世界和平大会纲领执行情况、目前国际形势和如何加强保卫和平运动等重要问题后，一致通过了《关于联合国的决议》、《关于缔结和平公约的宣言》、《关于以和平方式解决德国问题的决议》、《关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议》、《关于和平解决朝鲜问题的决议》、《关于联合国通过谴责中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的不公正的决定之决议》、《关于组织问题的决议》、《关于殖民地与附属国争取和平斗争的决议》、《关于“和平”杂志的决议》和《关于国际和平奖金的决议》十项文件。这十项文件是这次会议给世界保卫和平运动做出的极其伟大的贡献。这充分证明：为亿万爱好和平人民的代表们选出的和平理事会，已成能够实现世界人民和平意愿的强大组织，它实际上已取得了为联合国所业已丧失的人民的信任。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议的决议，严正地谴责了联合国竟漠视表达全世界和平人民意愿的《致联合国书》，谴责了联合国非法通过诬指中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的可耻决定。世界和平理事会决定派代表到联合国，要求联合国考虑《致联合国书》中的各项建议和这次会议的各项决议，要求联合国恢复执行联合国宪章所规定的任务，不应作为任何居统治地位的集团的工具。
    世界和平理事会的宣言，给世界和平拥护者规定了当前的主要任务——要求五大国缔结和平公约，号召全世界一切善良的人民和所有希望和平的团体签名支持这个宣言。正如南尼所说，这个宣言“将有助于把世界从新战争的危险中拯救出来，并把所有不希望战争的人们团结在它的周围。”
    会议的决议要求以和平方式解决德国和日本问题，要求召开一切有关国家的会议和平解决朝鲜问题，要求联合国取消诬指中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的非法决定。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议的历史性的宣言和各项决议，已获得全世界爱好和平人民的一致拥护与热烈支持。各国的和平战士们将以这些决议为其今后活动的基础，更广泛地动员全世界人民参加保卫和平与制止帝国主义坚持侵略和重新武装西德和日本的运动，并将把这一运动推向更高的阶段。
            反对帝国主义对殖民地的奴役
    二月二十一日是“反对殖民制度斗争日”，全世界的民主青年们一致以加强反对帝国主义侵略的战斗行动来纪念这个节日。
    我国三十余大城市各界、各族的青年在这一天举行了盛大的集会和示威游行，抗议美帝国主义的侵略。各地参加集会及示威的青年群众，都一致地表示要继续支援朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军打败美国侵略者，反对美国重新武装日本，并以抗美援朝的胜利支援东方被压迫民族的反对殖民制度的斗争。同时，我国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国民主青年联合总会致函亚洲各国青年，号召他们团结起来反对帝国主义统治，反对美国侵略。这对于亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族解放的斗争，将是一个重大的鼓舞。
    越南青年联合会主席阮奇山于“二、二一”发表声明，号召越南青年努力生产、踊跃参军、加紧学习，为击败法帝国主义和美国干涉者而斗争。
    在这一天，印度全印学生联合会特致电中国青年和苏联青年致敬，保证进一步加强中印、苏印青年友谊，并表示了印度青年为反对帝国主义侵略及保卫世界和平而斗争的决心。
    日本青年、缅甸青年、印尼青年也纷纷举行盛大集会。他们坚决表示要为反对殖民制度、制止帝国主义挑起世界大战的阴谋，为保卫世界和平而斗争。特别是日本青年，他们在美国占领当局和日本反动政府的重重阻挠下举行了集会。他们坚决反对日本反动政府与在朝鲜的美国侵略军勾结，反对日本殖民地化，反对签订片面和约与重新武装。
    在罗马尼亚的首都布加勒斯特，青年们举行了纪念大会并致电世界民主青年联盟表示罗马尼亚青年与各殖民地人民挣脱殖民制度压迫的神圣事业是联系在一起的。
            反对美国重新武装日本运动继续高涨
    反对美国重新武装日本的运动，已成为中国人民、包括日本人民在内的亚洲人民争取和平斗争的中心。
    中国人民的抗美援朝、反对美国武装日本的爱国运动，现正在普遍展开中。国内许多城市与部分乡村，先后举行过反对美国武装日本的示威游行大会及控诉日寇罪行大会。工人、农民、学生、工商业者、宗教徒及归国华侨，都积极参加了这个抗美爱国运动。全国人民对于日本帝国主义所加于我国的巨大的创痛，记忆犹新。旧的血债尚未偿还，而美帝国主义竟又企图重新扶植日本军国主义者重起侵略，这是我们中国人民所绝不能容许的。我们中国人民这一蓬勃高涨的抗美爱国运动已经严重地打击了美帝国主义及其日本走狗的阴谋计划，同时也有力地支援了日本人民反对重新武装的爱国斗争。全日产业别劳动组合会议于一月二十七日写给我全国总工会的信中，就已明显地表示了他们对中国人民支援的感谢。他们在信中并坚决地表示：“日本人民决不愿再与中国人民作战，而要对想使中日两国人民互相残杀、自己从中得利的帝国主义者及其走狗斗争到底。”中、日两国人民团结的伟大力量，必将给予美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋以最大的打击。
    要求全面媾和的签名，正在日本各地开展中，而且已取得相当的成绩。据出席世界和平理事会的日本代表河村一夫说，各民主党派与各民主团体已发起了征集一千万个签名的运动。东京的“芝浦职业安定所”的青年座谈会于一月十七日开始征集签名，至二十五日已征集到一千五百名以上。横滨市峰冈地方保土谷工厂宿舍的主妇们于很短时间内即征集了七百名以上。甚至在鼓吹法西斯战争的反动头子芦田均于二月四日在宫城县仙台市的时事讲演会上也有一半听众拒绝了他的煽动而在全面媾和的票上签上名字。
    日本各地的民主团体、进步工会组织、市民，均把“争取全面媾和，反对重新武装”这一伟大任务与争取民主及生活权利的斗争结合起来进行。一月二十五日在东京举行的日本全国官厅工会协议会第四次临时会议，全体通过要求缔结全面和约、反对重新武装的决议。日本国营铁路工会中央委员会，克服了分裂分子的阴谋，决定将“反对重新武装”列入斗争方针中。一月二十五日在东京举行的日本教职员工会中央委员会议发表声明，指出该中央委员会“再度确认了五十万教职员的历史任务，决定把一切斗争与要求全面和约及反对重新武装的斗争结合起来”。在神奈川县，造船工会分会的青年妇女部于一月十三日的会议中，决定将增加工资的斗争与反对重新武装的斗争结合进行。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议已通过了《关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议》，这一决议是完全符合于中国人民、亚洲人民和日本人民的利益的，它必将成为亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民反对美国重新武装日本的共同斗争纲领。
            欧洲工人阶级的统一行动
    在欧洲保卫和平运动中居于领导地位的工人阶级，已经充分认识到要彻底击败美国武装西德、发动新战争的阴谋计划，欧洲各国工人阶级必须团结起来，一致行动。西德的“加斯贝羽特”冶金工厂的工人首先提出召开欧洲工人代表大会，以便进一步展开反对美国重新武装西德阴谋的斗争。这一建议迅速获得了西德各企业的热烈响应。法、德两国工人代表的联合会议且根据这一建议成立筹委会，号召欧洲各国工人于今年三月二十三日至二十五日在柏林举行欧洲工人代表大会，讨论“欧洲各国劳动人民及各工会反对德国重新军国主义化的统一行动的问题”。
    法国各地为征集反对重新武装西德的签名，已经有了巨大的发展，仅二月初旬在三十五省中即有二百万人投票反对美国重新武装西德。法国共产党中央委员会并于二月十五日通过决议，号召全党党员参加抗议武装西德的签名运动，反对美国“明天把德国变做第二个朝鲜以扩大战争”的阴谋。荷兰京城人民七万五千人于二月二十五日举行的抗议德国重新武装的示威游行，由荷兰共产党及“二月罢工纪念委员会”联合领导。这些有力的广泛的行动已充分说明反对美国武装西德的运动已成为欧洲人民保卫和平运动的中心。
