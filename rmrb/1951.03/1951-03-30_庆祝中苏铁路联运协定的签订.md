　　Celebrating the Signing of the Sino-Soviet Railway Through Transport Agreement
    The Sino-Soviet Railway Through Transport Agreement, after three months of thorough preparation and sincere negotiations, was formally signed on March 14, 1951. This agreement includes through transport for passengers, luggage, and goods. That is to say, according to the agreement, passengers and cargo owners only need to complete travel and consignment procedures once to reach their destination station and receive their consigned goods. This reduces the many complex procedures of the past. Therefore, it greatly facilitates the travel of people and the exchange of goods between China and the Soviet Union, and also facilitates the travel of people and the exchange of goods between various new democratic countries. Therefore, the signing of this agreement will further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and the various new democratic countries, and further strengthen economic, cultural, and other ties. It is one of the specific implementations of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This is a new contribution to consolidating the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. It is also a powerful blow to the world's aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism.
    Prior to this agreement, China had never had international through transport of this nature and scale. Therefore, for us, this is still a new task. We must learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in this area, strive to implement this agreement, use vehicles more rationally and systematically, improve the efficiency of railway work, and undertake new tasks. The Soviet government has provided us with a great deal of assistance in the conclusion of this agreement. We warmly thank the Soviet government and the people for their kindness.

　　庆祝中苏铁路联运协定的签订
    中苏铁路联运协定经过三个月来的周密准备及诚挚的谈判后，已于一九五一年三月十四日正式签字了。这一协定包括旅客、行李及货物的联运。这就是说，根据协定的规定，旅客及货主只须办理一次旅行及托运手续后，即可到达目的地车站及领取所托运之货物。这就减少了过去许多复杂手续。因而大大便利了中苏两国人民的往来及货物的交流，同时也便利了各新民主主义国家人民的往来与货物的交流。因此，这一协定的签订将更加强中苏两大民族及与各新民主主义国家间的友好合作，更加密切了经济、文化以及其他方面的连系。它是中苏友好同盟互助条约的具体设施之一。这对巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营是一个新的贡献。对以美帝国主义为首的世界侵略集团又是一个有力的打击。
    在这一协定之前，中国从来不曾有过像今天这样性质与规模的国际联运。因此对我们来说，这还是一件新的工作。我们必须学习苏联在这方面先进的经验，努力实现此一协定，更加合理地有计划地运用车辆，提高铁路工作的效率，担负起新的任务。在订立这一协定时，苏联政府对我们有很多帮助，我们热忱地感谢苏联政府及人民的盛意。
