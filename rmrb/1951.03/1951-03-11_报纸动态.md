    Newspaper Updates
    Improvement Plan of Masses Daily
    On March 1st, the Xi'an Masses Daily published a long article by Hu Jiwei titled "How to Improve Masses Daily," which is a summary of the newspaper's work after checking the national news work conference since December last year, and the discussion of studying the meeting documents and Soviet newspaper management experience.

    The summary pointed out that the goal of the Masses Daily should be: to have distinctive Northwest local characteristics, fully reflect and promote the actual work in the Northwest; to deeply promote current affairs and policy propaganda to the broad masses; to meet the readers' requirements for literature, art, science, etc. In order to achieve these goals, the summary proposed that "the most important issue is to pay attention to strengthening the connection between the newspaper and the masses." It decided to "mobilize and organize a large number of worker-peasant correspondents to participate in newspaper work," "the newspaper editorial department actively participate in social activities"; "draw a portion of editors and comrades to send to various parts of the Northwest to be responsible for uniting and organizing a broad number of activists, ... strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the people of the Northwest." The summary also discussed and decided on improving writing style and layout allocation.
  《Agricultural Technology School》
    Following 《Workshop Work》 and 《Rural Work Symposium》, the Northeast Daily added a new column 《Agricultural Technology School》 on February 24th, publishing four articles related to soil improvement, such as 《Four Thousand Mu of Sandy Land Turns into Fertile Fields》, 《Waterlogged Lowland Makes a Great Turnaround》, and 《Four Examples of Soil Improvement》. The editors stated that this column will "introduce advanced experiences in improving technology and increasing production of grain and special products from various places at any time, as well as basic production knowledge related to improving technology."
  Experience of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    On March 1st, the Liberation Daily published a full-page article including 《Preliminary Summary of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Southern Jiangsu》, an excerpt of the summary speech by Liu Jiping, Deputy Director of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office, at the Southern Jiangsu Urban Work Conference, and articles such as 《Several Experiences in Carrying out Patriotic Movements in the Linyi Prefecture Rural Areas》. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement is being further deepened and popularized, and it is of great significance to summarize the existing experience in a timely manner and publish it.

    In order to meet the different requirements and purchasing power of readers in Shanghai and East China, the Liberation Daily has divided into "Local Edition" and "Outlying Edition" from March 1st. The content is slightly different depending on the needs of the region, and the price of the "Outlying Edition" is 300 yuan cheaper than the "Local Edition" because the "Outlying Edition" has eliminated unnecessary advertisements in places other than Shanghai. This is beneficial for readers in Shanghai and various parts of East China.
  Promote the Wisdom of the Masses
    The Shandong Rural Masses Daily's 《Rural Garden Column》 published a reader's letter on December 5th last year, raising the question of "how to solve the problem of village cadres holding multiple positions, having many meetings, and delaying production," and asking everyone to discuss it. As a result, it received seventy-two letters from one hundred and two readers distributed in more than forty counties in Shandong, and most of the participants in the discussion were village cadres, farmers, and some county and district cadres. The letters reported some factors that cause this phenomenon, and pointed out solutions: village cadres participate in production and lead production. This discussion is of great value.

　　报纸动态
    群众日报的改进计划
    西安群众日报三月一日发表了胡绩伟著的长文《怎样改进群众日报》，是该报去年十二月起检查全国新闻工作会议后的报纸工作，学习会议文件和苏联办报经验的讨论会的总结。
    总结中指出群众日报的努力目标是：应具有鲜明的西北地方色彩，充分反映并推动西北的实际工作；把时事宣传和政策宣传深入到广大群众中去；满足读者对文学、艺术、科学等的要求。为了达到这些目标，总结中提出“最重要的问题就是注重加强报纸和群众的联系”。决定“发动和组织广大工农通讯员参加报纸工作”，“报纸编辑部积极参加社会活动”；“抽出一部分编辑同志派到西北各地去，负责团结和组织广大的积极分子，……加强报纸与西北人民的联系”。总结中对于改进文风和版面配备也有所讨论和决定。
  《农业技术学校》
    东北日报继《车间工作》、《农村工作笔谈会》之后，二月二十四日又增辟了一个新专栏《农业技术学校》，发表了《四千亩沙地变良田》，《涝洼地大翻身》，《改良土壤四范例》等有关土壤改良的四篇文章。编者表示，这个专栏将“随时介绍各地改进技术，增产粮食、特产的先进经验和有关改进技术的基本生产知识”。
  抗美援朝运动的经验
    解放日报三月一日以整版篇幅，发表了《苏南抗美援朝运动的初步总结》，苏南行署副主任刘季平在苏南城市工作会议的总结发言摘要和《临沂专区农村开展爱国运动的几点体验》等文章。抗美援朝运动正在进一步深入和普及，及时总结已有的经验并加以发表是有很重大的意义的。
    为了适应上海和华东地区读者的不同的要求和不同的购买力，解放日报从三月一日起分出“本市版”和“外埠版”两种，内容因地区的需要而稍有不同，售价则因“外埠版”减去了上海以外各地不必要的广告等，比“本市版”便宜三百元。这对于上海和华东各地的读者都有好处。
  发扬群众的智慧
    山东农村大众报《农村园地栏》去年十二月五日发表了一篇读者来信：提出“村干兼职多，会议多，耽误生产怎样解决”的问题，要求大家讨论，结果收到了分布在山东各地四十余县的一百零二个读者写来的七十二封信，参加讨论的大部分是村干部、农民和部分县区干部。来信中报道了产生这种现象的一些因素，并指出了解决办法：村干部参加生产、领导生产。这个讨论是有很大的价值的。
