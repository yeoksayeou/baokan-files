　　The incident in Lingling County, Hunan Province, where counter-revolutionary secret agents deliberately set fire, causing a massive conflagration, has once again served as a severe warning to all the people and the People's Government. This warning is that the counter-revolutionary elements lurking throughout the country have not automatically ceased operations or been eliminated; they remain highly rampant. Therefore, it is imperative to resolutely implement the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries promulgated by the Central People's Government and thoroughly eliminate those incorrigible bandits. Otherwise, the people will be unable to live and work in peace. The notion that counter-revolutionaries have been suppressed to the point where we can relax our efforts is utterly wrong. Tolerance of counter-revolutionaries is cruelty to the people.

　　The Lingling counter-revolutionary arson incident demonstrates that the secret agent bandits, as running dogs of imperialism, are irreconcilable enemies of all good people in China. They not only seek to subvert the People's Government but also directly harm the people with the most vicious means. Their feelings, thoughts, and actions are different from ordinary people; they have forfeited their right to be human. We ask, what did the merchants and residents of Lingling City do to offend them, yet they secretly set fire to harm people while residents were celebrating the Lantern Festival, rendering one-tenth of the city's population homeless and destroying years of hard-earned savings in a single blaze. Are the secret agent bandits in other places any different? They always murder people's lives, rob people's property, sabotage people's production, and endanger people's freedom, preventing people from living in peace and stability. Therefore, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is a grave measure concerning the lives and property of millions of people. The broad masses of people so hate the secret agent bandits, repeatedly calling on the government not to be too lenient, and warmly applauding the government's resolute measures to punish counter-revolutionaries, precisely because they have learned a truth from their own experience: the line between the enemy and us cannot be eliminated; there is no coexistence. If those blood-soaked fellows are allowed to go unpunished, the evildoers will continue to do evil, the victims will continue to suffer, and the people's liberation will become empty words.

　　The Lingling incident teaches us that we must constantly heighten our vigilance and strictly guard against the sabotage and assassination of counter-revolutionary elements, so as not to cause losses to the people and their property. The reason why counter-revolutionary secret agents' conspiracies have succeeded in the past is often when people lacked vigilance and preparedness. The fact that the secret agents lurking in Lingling chose the Lantern Festival to commit arson on a large scale was certainly not without reason. It is regrettable that precisely at this time, the local People's Government and the military organs lost the noble quality of revolutionaries—political vigilance. They were engrossed in celebration and neglected the anti-espionage work that should never be neglected. But this problem of carelessness and negligence does not exist only in Lingling. Evidence of counter-revolutionary activities is discovered in public places but not investigated, political sabotage occurs in factories but the reasons are sought solely from a technical perspective, people are hired and retained without thoroughly investigating their backgrounds, allowing them to be exploited by reactionaries… are such phenomena rare? Every organ and every individual should learn some beneficial lessons from the Lingling incident, increase their political sensitivity a hundredfold, and never allow disasters similar to the Lingling incident to repeat themselves on our land.

　　From the Lingling incident, it can also be seen that the education on preventing counter-revolutionary activities in the broad masses of people and the army is still very weak, so counter-revolutionary secret agents were able to buy flammable materials and set fires in eight or nine places simultaneously without being detected beforehand. Trade unions, peasant associations, federations of industry and commerce, women's federations, as well as news, publishing, cultural, educational, and artistic organs and organizations, should constantly tell the masses what bad things counter-revolutionary elements have done, what harm they pose to the nation and the people, why they must be resolutely suppressed, and how everyone should assist the government in eliminating spies and preventing espionage. This propaganda and education work is not enough to do once or twice but must be carried out repeatedly and continuously. In particular, we must be good at seizing the counter-revolutionary sabotage and assassination incidents that occur at that time and place, seizing the evidence of the crimes of counter-revolutionary bandits related to the local people, and the trials of counter-revolutionary bandits, to enhance the people's understanding with vivid facts. This is an important political education that must be carried out among the people of the whole country at present.

### 对于反革命的宽容就是对人民的残忍

　　对于反革命的宽容就是对人民的残忍
    湖南省零陵县反革命特务分子有计划地纵火造成巨大火灾的事件，再一次地给了我们全国人民和人民政府一个严重的警告。这个警告就是：潜伏国内各地的反革命分子并没有自动地休息和消灭，他们依然十分猖獗。因此，必须坚决地执行中央人民政府所颁布的惩治反革命条例，把那些怙恶不悛的匪徒彻底消灭。否则，人民就无法安居乐业。那种认为反革命已被镇压得差不多了，可以放松一些了的想法，是完全错误的。对于反革命的宽容就是对于人民的残忍。
    零陵反革命纵火事件表明，作为帝国主义走狗的特务匪徒，是中国所有善良人民的不共戴天的死仇。他们不仅图谋颠覆人民政府，而且直接地以最狠毒的手段来残害人民。他们的感情、思想、行为和一般人不一样，他们已经丧失了做人的资格。试问，零陵城的商民有什么对不起他们的地方，然而他们却乘居民欢庆元宵的时候，偷偷摸摸地干下了放火害人的勾当，使得全城十分之一的人口无家可归，多少年来辛辛苦苦积蓄的财产被一烧而光。其他地方的特务匪徒又何尝两样。他们总是杀害人民的生命，抢劫人民的财物，破坏人民的生产，危害人民的自由，使人民不能安安稳稳地过日子。所以，镇压反革命活动，是关系千千万万人民生命财产的严重措施。广大人民如此地仇恨特务匪徒，一再呼吁政府不要再太过宽大，而对政府坚决惩办反革命的措施热烈欢呼，就是因为他们已经从切身经验中体会到了一个真理：敌我之间的界限是无法消除的，有敌无我，如果任令那班满手人血的家伙逍遥法外，作恶的依然作恶，受害的依然受害，人民的翻身就会成为一句空话。
    零陵事件教训我们必须时时刻刻地提高警惕性，严密防范反革命分子的破坏和暗害，勿使人民和人民的财产遭受损失。历次反革命特务分子阴谋之得以实现，往往是在人们缺乏警惕和戒备的时候。这次零陵潜藏的特务分子之所以挑选元宵佳节来大肆纵火当然不是没有原因的。可痛心的是恰恰正是这时候，当地人民政府和驻军机关丧失了革命者的高尚品质——政治警觉性。他们热中于欢庆，而疏忽了无论何时都不能疏忽的防奸工作。可是这种麻痹大意的毛病，并不是仅仅在零陵一个地方存在。公共场所发现反革命活动的证据不追究，工厂里发生了政治性破坏的事故一味从技术上找原因，用人留人不查清来历，以致被反动派所利用，……难道这种现象还少吗？每一个机关每一个人都应该从零陵事件中吸取到一些有益的教训，百倍地提高自己的政治嗅觉，决不要让类似零陵事件的灾祸在我们的国土上重复出现。
    从零陵事件中还可看到，我们在广大人民和军队中关于防止反革命活动的教育还是十分薄弱的，因此反革命特务分子能够买了引火物同时在八九处放火，而事前竟未被发觉。各地工会、农民协会、工商界联合会、妇女联合会以及新闻、出版、文化、教育、艺术机关和团体，应该经常地告诉人民群众，反革命分子作了些什么坏事，对国民和人民有什么危害，为什么必须坚决镇压，大家应该怎样来协助政府除奸防谍。这种宣传教育工作不是作一次两次就够了，而要反复不断地进行。特别要善于抓住当时当地所发生的反革命暗害破坏事件，抓住与当地人民有关的反革命匪徒的罪证和对于反革命匪徒的审判，以活生生的事实，来提高人民群众的认识。这是当前在全国人民中所必须进行的重要政治教育。
