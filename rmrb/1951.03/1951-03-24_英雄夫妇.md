　　Heroic Couple
　　Li Shuiyi and Li Xiude, a poor peasant couple from Limu Village, Pyonggang County, Kangwon Province, Korea, are a famous sharpshooting pair.
　　After the Soviet army liberated North Korea on August 15, 1945, they were allotted more than 5,000 "ping" of land. Their life was like this every year: during the spring, summer, and autumn, they diligently and happily worked their land together; in the winter, the couple went to the towering mountains of the Kangwon Province region, hunting wild animals in the freezing snow. By the end of the lunar year, they returned laden with their catch, celebrating the Spring Festival joyfully. Their life was pleasant and happy. In the winter of 1947, Li Xiude presented a large white wild boar she had hunted to the beloved leader General Kim Il-sung, which became a widely told story.
　　Last June, the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, disrupting the happy and wonderful life of Li Shuiyi and his wife. When the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops occupied Pyonggang, they immediately took up arms, mobilized other local peasant activists, and jointly organized a guerrilla隊.
　　One gloomy morning in late October last year, their guerrilla隊 received a report from scouts: a truck convoy of Syngman Rhee's bandit army was about to pass through Limu Village heading north. The Li Shuiyi guerrilla隊 members quickly ambushed on both sides of the road. As the motorcade was about to enter the village, Li Shuiyi gave the order, and a burst of grenades destroyed all six enemy trucks. The goddess sharpshooter Li Xiude's first bullet killed the bandit army's transportation captain. In an instant, the guerrillas wiped out all seventy-seven Syngman Rhee bandit soldiers. This was the guerrilla隊's first victorious battle.
　　On October 29, the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops set up an execution ground in Xianzai District, Pyonggang County, preparing to massacre eight patriots, including Liu Wenhao, the head of the People's Government district. After hearing the news, Li Shuiyi and his wife led the guerrillas to rescue them. They not only rescued the eight patriots but also captured thirteen Syngman Rhee bandit soldiers on the spot, and opened the warehouse to return the grain looted by the enemy to the local residents.
　　The strength of the Li Shuiyi guerrilla隊 gradually grew with the enthusiastic support of the people behind enemy lines, and its area of operation also expanded day by day. Li Shuiyi and his wife became more well-known and loved by the local people.
　　When the Korean and Chinese People's forces launched a counter-offensive and fought to Pyonggang County, the Li Shuiyi and Li Xiude guerrilla隊 had sixty-four members, equipped with American-made weapons seized from the enemy. In the battle to liberate Pyonggang County by the Korean and Chinese People's armies, the Li Shuiyi and Li Xiude guerrilla隊 cooperated with the main force to intercept the fleeing enemy, wiping out more than thirty enemy soldiers, and won the praise of the leaders of a certain unit of the People's Army.
　　Now, all members of the Li Shuiyi and Li Xiude guerrilla隊 have joined the People's Army units. Li Shuiyi has become a company commander, and Li Xiude has also become a platoon leader, continuing to fight for the liberation war of the motherland. The heroic deeds of Li Shuiyi and Li Xiude have spread throughout Korea.

　　英雄夫妇
    朝鲜江原道平康县梨木村贫农夫妇李洙一和李秀德是一对有名的神枪手。
    在一九四五年“八一五”苏军解放北朝鲜后，他俩分得了五千多坪土地。他们每年是这样生活的：春夏秋三季，他俩勤奋而愉快地在自己的土地上一块耕作；到了冬天，夫妇二人就走到江原道地区的崇山峻岭间，在冰天雪地里猎取野兽。直到农历年底，他俩带着猎物满载而归，欢度春节。他们俩的生活是愉快而幸福的。一九四七年冬，李秀德曾把自己猎获的一只大白野猪，献给敬爱的领袖金日成将军，一时传为佳话。
    去年六月，美帝国主义发动的侵朝战争，破坏了李洙一夫妇的幸福而美好的生活。当美、李匪军侵占平康后，他俩就立即拿起武器，发动当地其他的农民积极分子，共同组织了游击队。
    去年十月下旬的一个阴沉的清晨，他们的游击队得到了侦察员报告：李承晚匪军的卡车队将要经过梨木村向北开。李洙一游击队队员们迅速地埋伏在公路两旁。当汽车队刚要进村时，李洙一一声号令，一阵手榴弹就把敌人的六辆卡车全部炸毁。女神枪手李秀德的第一颗子弹就射死了匪军的运输队长。游击队在刹那间就全部歼灭李匪军七十七名。这是游击队旗开得胜的第一仗。
    十月二十九日，美、李匪军在平康县岘在区布置刑场，准备屠杀人民政府的区长柳文浩等八位爱国者。李洙一夫妇闻讯后即率领游击队前往抢救。他们不但解救了八位爱国者，当场还活捉十三名李匪军，并且打开仓库，把敌人掠夺的粮食还给了当地居民。
    李洙一游击队的力量在敌后人民的热烈支持下逐渐壮大，活动范围也日益扩展，李洙一夫妇也更为当地人民所熟知与热爱了。
    当朝、中人民部队发动反攻，打到平康县时，李洙一、李秀德游击队已拥有队员六十四人，配备了从敌人手中夺来的美造武器。在朝中人民军队解放平康县的战斗中，李洙一、李秀德游击队配合主力截击逃敌，歼敌三十余名，荣获人民军某部首长的表扬。
    现在，李洙一、李秀德游击队全体队员参加了人民军部队，李洙一当了连长，李秀德也当了排长，继续为祖国的解放战争而战斗。李洙一和李秀德的英勇事迹，传遍了朝鲜各地。
