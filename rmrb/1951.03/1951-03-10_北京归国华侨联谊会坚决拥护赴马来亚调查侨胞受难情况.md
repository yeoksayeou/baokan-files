　　Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association Firmly Supports Investigation of the Suffering of Overseas Chinese in Malaya

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: A spokesperson for the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association recently issued a statement firmly supporting the decision of the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees to organize an investigation team to go to Malaya to investigate the situation of the refugees, stating:

　　Our country's charitable organizations and people's organizations, accepting the suggestion of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Anti-American Armed Japan Demonstration Parade, organized the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees and decided to send an investigation team to various parts of Malaya to investigate the suffering of overseas Chinese. This righteous action fully demonstrates the concern of the people of the motherland for the overseas Chinese in Malaya who are persecuted by British imperialism. This kind of concern can only be shown in the great people's motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

　　We returned overseas Chinese firmly support and actively support this righteous action. We firmly believe that this action will also receive the support and sympathy of peace-loving and democratic people all over the world.

　　We will never forget the destruction and discrimination that imperialists have inflicted on our overseas Chinese. In particular, the bloody massacre and trampling of 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya by the British colonial authorities is even more infuriating. We cannot sit idly by and ignore our compatriots being subjected to long-term humiliation. We must take active action to support the efforts of overseas Chinese living in dire straits to strive for survival and defend their legitimate rights and interests.

　　北京归国华侨联谊会坚决拥护赴马来亚调查侨胞受难情况
    【新华社九日讯】北京归国华侨联谊会发言人顷发表谈话，坚决拥护中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会关于组织调查团赴马来亚调查难侨情况的决定称：
    我国慈善团体及各人民团体，接受北京归国华侨反对美国武装日本示威游行大会的建议，组织了中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会，并决定派调查团赴马来亚各地调查侨胞受难情况。此一正义行动，充分证明了祖国人民对远处海外在英帝国主义迫害下的马来亚侨胞的关切。这种关切，只有在毛主席领导下的伟大的人民祖国才能表现出来。
    我们归国华侨坚决地拥护并积极地支持这一正义行动。我们深信，这一行动也必将获得全世界爱好和平与民主的人民的支持与同情。
    帝国主义者对我海外侨胞的摧残与歧视，我们是永远不会忘记的。特别是马来亚二百八十万侨胞遭受英国殖民当局的血腥屠杀与蹂躏，更令人愤慨万端。我们不能坐视自己同胞长期地横遭凌辱而置之不顾。我们一定要积极地行动起来，支援海外侨胞在水深火热下为争取生存、保卫自己正当权益的努力。
