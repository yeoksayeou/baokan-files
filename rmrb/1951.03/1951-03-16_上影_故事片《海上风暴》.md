    The boundless ocean under a clear sky, countless sailboats billowing in the wind, and melodious, joyful songs resonating across the sea. “To liberate Taiwan and complete China's final unification”—the People's Liberation Army soldiers are practicing naval combat day and night on the turbulent ocean, and thus the story unfolds.

  A unit of the PLA, consisting of forty-two soldiers led by Company Commander Guo, sets out to sea for combat exercises. When the ship reaches the deep sea, a storm suddenly arises. Company Commander Guo's ship is battered by giant waves, tossing and turning in the ocean. Soon, the ship's mid-cabin leaks, the anchor is swept away by the waves, and the main mast is broken. At this point, the ship is no longer under human control, at the mercy of the wind and waves.

  Late at night, they drift to a deserted island. On this island lives only one family, three generations—an elderly fisherman, his middle-aged daughter-in-law, and his granddaughter, Xiao Feng, who now depend on only two mu of sweet potatoes for survival.

  That night, these forty-two soldiers land on the island. Suddenly, gunshots are heard, indicating enemy activity nearby. The company commander assigns guard duties and sets up camp on the island, waiting for the wind to calm down the next day to return to the unit.

  Due to a lack of sailing experience, the ship is destroyed by seawater and reefs during the night.

  The next morning, as they joyfully prepare to board the ship and return to camp, they encounter this unfortunate event. Company Commander Guo quickly exchanges opinions with branch committee member Platoon Leader Zheng, Deputy Platoon Leader Xia, Squad Leader Xu, and others, and convenes an enlarged meeting of the Party's temporary branch to explain the future path and call on comrades to make long-term plans. Under the leadership of the Communist Party members, these forty-two soldiers begin a new life on this deserted island.

  Near the deserted island is a large island called Black Shirt Island, which is occupied by a relatively strong force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. They attempt to use their superior forces to attack the forty-two people's soldiers by boat, and they coerce two sailors to deliver a letter to induce surrender. However, due to the calm and resourcefulness of the people's soldiers, the enemy ship turns tail and flees.

  They have been living on the island for five days. Because there are no ships coming and going, the way out remains bleak. Although they have a good relationship with the island's inhabitants, staying like this is not a long-term solution. Therefore, they decide to convert the large ship into a raft, led by Platoon Leader Zheng, along with Little Yang and two sailors, to return home to send a message for help.

  It is the seventh night. Platoon Leader Zheng's raft departs, and the soldiers pin their greatest hopes on it, waiting for their victorious return.

  Ever since Company Commander Guo's ship drifted away, all the comrades of a unit of the PLA, from leaders to cadres, from the people to the soldiers, have been concerned about the fate of these forty-two people's soldiers at all times. The military headquarters sent Battalion Commander Song to search in the sea, but to no avail. The senior political commissar of the military headquarters convened a meeting for this matter, saying: "Soldiers are the treasures of the country. In order to eliminate the enemy, any sacrifice is worth it during wartime, but in peacetime, even if the soldiers scratch their skin, the leaders will feel distressed. We should do everything possible to continue to search."

  During this time, Platoon Leader Zheng, sailing on a raft in the ocean, encounters another storm, drifting for four days and four nights. After enduring unbearable hunger and pain, he finally sees the mainland coast and the five-star red flag. With the help of fraternal units, he returns to his own ranks. Senior Political Commissar warmly receives them and assigns Battalion Commander Song to rescue the forty-two people's soldiers from danger.

  Company Commander Guo's troops have been living on the deserted island for twelve days. All the edible wild vegetables and weeds on the deserted island have been eaten. The enemy is constantly attacking them, and the soldiers are already weak and emaciated. These forty-two people's soldiers are facing a "life-or-death crisis." Therefore, under the leadership of Company Commander Guo, the entire platoon of soldiers faces the ocean and makes a solemn oath to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the people of the whole country. They swear: "We would rather die fighting than starve to death!" The day after the oath, they decide to build another raft and launch a surprise attack on the enemy island to seize a ship and return home. This time, Deputy Platoon Leader Xia leads the mission. The old fisherman on the island, who hates the enemy for their atrocities against him, volunteers to lead the way.

  The battle thus begins. Deputy Platoon Leader Xia and others complete the mission of seizing a ship and return to the island. The enemy pursues them, forcibly landing on the small island with their superior forces. The forty-two people's soldiers, in hunger and exhaustion, persist in fighting the enemy. However, due to being outnumbered, Company Commander Guo leads the entire platoon to transfer to the eastern hilltop, holding onto the last position. When they are out of ammunition and food and in a desperate situation, Battalion Commander Song, Platoon Leader Zheng, and others arrive with reinforcements. The enemy shamefully surrenders and becomes prisoners of the People's Liberation Army.

  Under the victorious "August 1st" military flag, the battalion commander and the forty-two people's soldiers have a victorious reunion on the island.

  These forty-two people's soldiers, under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, under the care and love of their superiors, and amidst the boiling welcome of the masses, finally return in triumph, filled with honor, and holding high the banner of victory.

    万里晴空的海洋，无数的帆船迎风飘荡，悠扬愉快的歌声在海洋上而彻响。“为了解放台湾，完成中国最后统一”——人民解放军的战士们，日日夜夜的在怒涛澎湃的海洋上演习着航海作战，于是故事就这样展开了。
  解放军某部四十二个战士，在郭连长率领下，出海演习作战。船到深海的时候，突然起了暴风，郭连长的船被巨浪撞击着，在海洋里颠簸。稍许，船的中舱漏洞了，锚也被巨浪卷走，大桅也折断了，这时船已失去了人力的掌握，听命于风浪的摆布。
  深夜，他们飘到了一个孤岛。这岛上只有一家老百姓，祖孙三代——年迈的老渔夫，中年的儿媳及孙女小凤，他们现在依靠仅有的两亩山芋为生。
  当晚，这四十二个战士，在这小岛登陆。突然传来枪声，知道附近有敌情，连长就分配警戒任务，露营在岛上，等第二天风平了回队。
  由于缺乏航海经验，船在夜间被海水和礁石撞毁。
  翌晨，当他们兴高采烈地预备登船回营的时候，突然遭遇这不幸的事件，于是郭连长很快的找支部委员郑排长、夏排附、徐班长等交换了意见，召开了党的临时支部扩大会议，说明了今后的出路问题，并号召同志们作长期计划。由于共产党员的领导，这四十二位战士便在这孤岛上展开了新的生活。
  孤岛的附近有个大岛名叫黑衫岛，为相当强大的蒋匪军盘据着，出没无常。他们想以其优势兵力，乘船向四十二位人民战士进攻，并威逼水手二人前来送信诱降。可是由于人民战士的沉着机智，敌船便掉头鼠窜而逃。
  他们在岛上已经住了五天，由于没有船只来往，出路仍然渺茫，虽然在岛上和老百姓的关系处的很好，但这样住下去总不是办法，于是决定把大船改造成木筏，由郑排长率领小杨及两个水手回家送信求援。
  是第七天夜晚。郑排长的木筏出发了，战士们寄赋了最大的希望，等待他们胜利归来。
  自从郭连长的船只飘走后，解放军某部的全体同志从首长到干部，从人民到战士，时时刻刻在关怀着这四十二位人民战士的命运。军部曾派宋营长到海里去寻找，但始终没有下落。军部的高级政委为此事召开了会议，他说：“战士是国家的财宝，为了消灭敌人，在战时任何牺牲在所不惜，可是在平时，战士们那怕擦破了一块皮，做首长的也会感到心疼的，我们应想尽一切办法继续去追寻。”
  这期间，在海洋里乘着木筏的郑排长，又遇到了风暴，飘了四天四夜，经过难以忍受的饥饿和痛苦，终于看到大陆的海岸，看见了五星红旗，经过兄弟部队的帮助回到自己的队伍来。高政委热忱的接见他们，并指派宋营长前去营救这四十二位人民战士出险。
  郭连长的部队在荒岛上已经生活十二天了，荒岛上所能吃的野菜荒草都吃光了，敌人不断向他们进攻，战士已经瘦弱不堪，这四十二位人民战士已面临“生死的关头”，于是在郭连长率领之下，全排战士面对海洋，向党、向毛主席、向全国人民举行了庄严的宣誓，他们宣誓：“宁拚死，不饿死！”宣誓后的第二天，决定再造木筏，前往偷袭敌岛，抓船回家。此次由夏排附带领。岛上的老渔夫憎恨敌人对他的残害，他自告奋勇的愿意前去带路。
  战斗就这样开始了。夏排附等完成了抓船任务回岛，敌人尾追过来，以其优势的兵力强行在小岛登陆，四十二位人民战士在饥饿疲困之下，坚持与敌人斗争。但因寡不敌众，郭连长率领着全排同志往东山头转移，坚持着最后的阵地。当弹尽粮绝万分危急的关头，宋营长郑排长等的援兵赶到。敌人狼狈的缴枪投降，做了人民解放军的俘虏。
  在胜利的“八一”军旗下，营长与四十二位人民战士在岛上胜利的会师了。
  这四十二位人民战士在共产党、人民解放军的培养教育下，在上级的关怀与爱护之下，在群众沸腾的欢迎之下，终于载满了荣誉，高举着胜利的旗帜凯旋归来。
