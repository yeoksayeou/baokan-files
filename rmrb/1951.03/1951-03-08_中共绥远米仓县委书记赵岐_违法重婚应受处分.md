Comrade Editor:

My husband, Zhao Qi, was originally the Deputy Secretary of the CCP Shulu County Committee in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province. We were married in December 1945, when I was working in the Women's Federation of the Seventh District of that county. At the end of December 1949, Zhao Qi was transferred to Suiyuan Province and appointed as the Secretary of the Micang County Committee of that province. At that time, I was pregnant and did not go with him. In early February 1950, Zhao Qi sent a courier, Chen Mancang, from Suiyuan to my home (I had not yet given birth and was resting at home) to persuade me not to go to Suiyuan; and secretly took his new lover, Liu Mian (who was working in the Shulu County Women's Federation at the time), to Suiyuan. After Liu Mian went to Suiyuan, she married Zhao Qi. In March of the same year, Zhao Qi wrote to me proposing a divorce. He was afraid that I would look for him, so he didn't even tell me his address. I believe that Zhao Qi's marriage to another person without divorcing me is a violation of the Marriage Law.

After I gave birth and returned to my original job, I asked Comrade Li Jianxiu, the Minister of the County Party Committee's Organization Department, about this matter. Minister Li said, "I won't hide it from you, Zhao Qi was engaged to Liu Mian before he was transferred." He also admitted that the County Party Committee already knew about this matter at that time. I believe that Comrade Li Jianxiu's practice of condoning comrades' mistakes is also unprincipled.

I appealed to the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee about this matter. The Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee notified me on July 25, 1950, that it had reported this issue to the Hebei Provincial Committee. The Provincial Committee agreed to discipline Zhao Qi and sent the materials to Zhao Qi's superior authorities, asking them to handle this issue. However, more than half a year has passed and I have not received a reply. Therefore, I am telling you about this matter in the hope that you will help me resolve this issue.

Editor's note: Zhao Qi, the Secretary of the Micang County Committee in Suiyuan Province, married another person without divorcing his wife, Wang Fengwei. This constitutes bigamy. Although the fact of Zhao Qi's bigamy occurred before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the marriage regulations promulgated and implemented in various liberated areas have always prohibited bigamy. Zhao Qi is a Communist Party member and a leading cadre of the county party committee. This behavior not only violates government decrees but is also intolerable by party discipline and should be subject to party discipline and national law.

### 中共绥远米仓县委书记赵岐  违法重婚应受处分

　　中共绥远米仓县委书记赵岐
    违法重婚应受处分编辑同志：
    我的爱人赵岐，原为中共河北省石家庄专区束鹿县委副书记。我和他在一九四五年十二月间结婚，当时我在该县七区妇女联合会工作。一九四九年十二月底，赵岐被调到绥远省，任该省米仓县县委书记。当时我因怀孕，故未同行。一九五○年二月初，赵岐派交通员陈满仓从绥远来到我家（那时我尚未生育，在家休养）劝我不要到绥远去；并暗中把他的新爱人刘勉（当时在束鹿县妇女联合会工作）接到绥远去。刘勉去绥远后，就和赵岐结了婚。同年三月间，赵岐才来信向我提出离婚。他怕我去找他，还不把他的地址告诉我。我认为赵岐没有和我离婚就和旁人结婚，是违犯婚姻法的。
    当我分娩后，回到原工作岗位时，即向县委组织部长李建修同志询问此事。李部长说：“我不瞒哄你，赵岐临调走时即与刘勉订了婚。”他并承认那时县委已知道此事。我认为李建修同志这种纵容同志犯错误的做法也是无原则的。
    我为此事到石家庄地委会申诉。地委组织部在一九五○年七月二十五日通知我：已将此问题报告河北省委。省委同意给赵岐处分。并将材料寄给赵岐所属上级，请他们处理这一问题。但至今已经半年多，还没得到答复。因此，我特把此事告诉你们，希望你们帮助我解决这个问题。

    编者按：绥远省米仓县县委书记赵岐未与其妻王凤委离婚，便与他人结婚，这是重婚行为。赵岐重婚的事实虽然发生在婚姻法公布以前，但历来各解放区所公布施行的婚姻条例都是禁止重婚的。赵岐是共产党员，且为县委机关的负责干部，这种行为不但违反政府的法令，也为党纪所不容许，应该受到党的处分和国家法律的制裁。
