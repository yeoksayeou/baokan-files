Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 27th: A large number of Korean workers, farmers, and students who recently joined the ranks of the Korean People's Army for revenge have been tempered into strong and fearless people's warriors in the fierce battles against the American invading army on the Han River front.

In the battle of Mt. Su-ri on the south bank of the Han River, Shin Cheong-gyun, a new warrior from a coal mine, and his comrades repelled 29 enemy assaults. Although he was wounded in four places, he and three comrades finally defeated the enemy's last attack. New warrior Yun Chang-in led his comrades through layers of enemy fire, fearlessly jumped into the Han River, and aimed and fired at the enemy advancing from the south bank. With the coordination of artillery fire, they finally defeated a batch of enemies who were attempting to cross the river. At the position of anti-aircraft gunner Heo Seop, enemy planes dropped more than 70 bombs and strafed more than 700 bullets, but Heo Seop fought bravely with six American planes for three full hours, finally shooting down two enemy planes.

The will to defend the motherland and avenge the people has enabled these new warriors to quickly learn how to fight the enemy. Every commander and fighter deeply understands the importance of learning. Everyone participates in learning in front of the enemy. They adopted various methods such as learning while fighting and learning from each other, and also used the gaps between battles to visit the positions of the Chinese People's Volunteers to continuously improve their combat skills. Kim Seung-woon, a Hero of the Republic, was originally a kind farmer. After joining the army, he practiced hard day and night and finally mastered anti-aircraft gunnery skills, thus creating an outstanding record of shooting down five enemy planes. Similarly, artilleryman Woo Yong-dae, who was a student, used seven shells from the north bank of the Han River to destroy four American tanks on the south bank of the Han River, and used five shells to kill an enemy platoon attempting to cross the Han River in the river.

In more than a month of heroic fighting on the Han River front, a certain unit of the People's Army produced ten "Heroes of the Republic" who repeatedly performed extraordinary feats, and more than four thousand resourceful and brave commanders and fighters won medals and awards at all levels.

　　朝鲜人民军大批新战士
    在汉江前线作战中已锻炼成坚强战士
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】不久以前才参加朝鲜人民军复仇行列的大批朝鲜工人农民和学生，已经在汉江前线打击美国侵略军的激烈战斗中，锻炼成为坚强无畏的人民战士。
    在汉江南岸修理山战斗中，煤矿工人出身的新战士申清均，和他的战友们一道击退了敌人的二十九次冲锋。他自己虽然也受了四处伤，但最后还和三个战友打垮了敌人的最后一次进攻。新战士尹昌仁带着他的战友们穿过敌人的层层火网，奋不顾身地跳进汉江，在水中向由南岸进犯的敌人瞄准射击，在炮火的配合下，终于击溃了一批渡江进犯的敌人。在对空射击手许摄的阵地上，敌机投下了七十多枚炸弹，扫射了七百多发子弹，可是许摄毫不畏惧地同六架美国飞机整整搏斗了三个钟头，终于将两架敌机击落。
    保卫祖国和为人民复仇的意志，使这些新战士们很快学会了怎样和敌人作战。每一个指挥员和战斗员都深深了解学习的重要性。人人参加了敌前学习。他们采取了边打边学、你打我学等种种办法，更利用战斗空隙到中国人民志愿军阵地上去参观，不断提高自己的战斗技术。共和国英雄金承云，原是个善良农民。入伍以后，他日夜不停地苦练，终于掌握了对空射击的技术，因而创造了击落敌机五架的优异纪录。同样，学生出身的炮手禹龙台，从汉江北岸用七发炮弹击毁汉江南岸的四辆美国坦克，又用五发炮弹把企图偷渡汉江的敌人一个排打死在江里。
    在汉江前线一个多月的英勇作战中，人民军某部就涌现了十名屡建奇功的“共和国英雄”，并且有四千多名智勇双全的指挥员和战斗员获得了各级勋章和奖章。
