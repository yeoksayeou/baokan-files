　　Heilongjiang Province's Achievements and Experiences in Promoting New Agricultural Tools
　　Jin Langbai, Deputy Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry

　　In 1950, the province promoted a total of 1,244 sets of Soviet horse-drawn agricultural implements and 3,875 various types of cultivators and harrows. We have learned that promoting and using new agricultural tools is a revolutionary task and the beginning of an agricultural production revolution:

　　First, using new agricultural tools can reduce the labor intensity of farmers: In the early stages of preparing for spring plowing in 1950, we first promoted hay rakes. This hay rake can be used not only by male laborers, but also by female laborers when more are promoted in the future, and both people and horses are less tired. An old farmer in Nehe County, who was sixty years old, said, "I have been farming all my life, and today is the first time I have seen people and horses separated." Farmers at a agricultural tool symposium in Keshan County reflected on how easy and labor-saving hay rakes were to use. In Keshan's Taiping Village, two hay rakes competed with sixty old-fashioned rakes, and the result was that the two hay rakes could rake eighteen carts of firewood a day, while the sixty rakes could only rake a little over one cart a day. The same is true for cultivators and harrows; three horses and one person can cultivate and harrow in one go, and there is no need to bend over. Harvesting is the hardest work in farming, especially wheat harvesting when the weather is hot and bitter. With old agricultural tools, one person leads the way, and the people behind have to hurry to keep up, and their backs cannot straighten up. After working all day, they really want to "crawl onto the kang on the cat's tail" at night.

　　Second, using new agricultural tools can increase productivity and expand cultivated land area: The Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry lent Wang Zhentang's group two sets of Soviet horse-drawn agricultural implements. In 1950, the entire group reclaimed 97 hectares, equivalent to 1,185 mu. The group's cultivated land area in 1950 exceeded the cultivated land area in 1949 by more than 88%, and more than doubled that of 1946, 1947, and 1948, saving the entire group a total of 1,410 workdays. Wang Zhentang's village was originally barren and poor, but because they organized themselves to use new agricultural tools, Wang Zhentang's group had a surplus of 700 shi of grain, with each laborer responsible for 114 mu of cultivated land. Because of the use of new agricultural tools, Wang Zhijian's group in Nehe County has increased the total land area from 84 hectares to 165 hectares, with each laborer responsible for 150 mu of cultivated land.

　　Third, it has opened up broad avenues for the construction of a new democratic countryside: Because the new agricultural tools harrow finely and cultivate evenly, they can not only produce more grain, but also reduce pests and diseases. The use of seeders has increased the number of seedlings from five per two and a half *long* of land to ten. The use of new agricultural tools has guaranteed intensive cultivation. Many mutual aid teams have achieved four cultivations and four harrowings, or even eight cultivations and eight harrowings, by using cultivators and harrows. Harvesters cut quickly and evenly. Harvesting one hectare of crops generally requires five workdays, but a harvester with six people and four horses can harvest five hectares a day. Due to the promotion of new agricultural tools, farmers generally demand strong and powerful draft animals, and of course, the current conditions also allow them to raise good cattle and horses. For example, Wang Zhentang's group has already bred twenty horses and plans to buy twenty-five more horses this year, including one foreign-breed horse and one foreign-breed cow. With new agricultural tools, farmers have the surplus labor to engage in sideline occupations, fully utilizing the labor of laborers and semi-laborers, and combining agriculture and sideline occupations. The division of labor in agriculture and sideline occupations in various mutual aid teams has resulted in sideline income of more than 40 billion Northeast currency.

　　Based on the experience and lessons learned from promoting new agricultural tools over the past year, we have the following preliminary understandings:

　　First, the promotion of new agricultural tools must focus on quality, unified specifications, and centralized manufacturing: We did not grasp this point well and made mistakes in the past. The cultivated land in the province accounts for about 27% of the arable land, and the arable land that has not been cultivated still accounts for 60%. There is less labor, and each laborer has to bear 60 mu of cultivated land. The frost-free period throughout the year is 120 to 130 days. In order to not violate the farming season and increase production, it is necessary to solve the cultivation and harrowing problem in order to carry out intensive cultivation and expand the cultivated land area. Last year, our thinking was to do everything, and the quality was not good, and the specifications were not uniform. More than 30 factories were manufacturing eleven kinds of agricultural tools, and they were competing with each other, each coming up with its own ideas, and some could not even be used. Some farmers reflected that these were "deceitful machines" and a "horse-drawn plan." Accepting this lesson, in the second half of last year, after one or two hundred experiments, we developed a comprehensive cultivator and harrow, which was generally welcomed by farmers.

　　Second, there must be a focus when starting to promote: If new agricultural tools are promoted on a large scale from the beginning, the work is not easy to grasp, and the masses are also more difficult to accept. It is better to start with a focus on promoting them from mutual aid teams. For example, Wang Zhentang's group reclaimed more than 90 hectares at the beginning, and the effect naturally came significantly. In addition, the leadership must personally grasp and specifically lead the promotion, and first of all, focus on breaking down the ideological concerns of the masses and cadres. Farmers will naturally be willing to use them when they see the actual benefits. Suihua, Keshan, and Nehe have done a better job in this regard. The county party secretaries and agricultural section chiefs have personally taken action, especially in Keshan County, where it was put forward as a political task.

　　Third, one must learn and master the technology: There are many technical issues in the use of any new agricultural tool. Last spring, we trained more than 500 machine operators and tried our best to ensure that the comrades participating in the promotion work understood the performance of the new agricultural tools.

　　Fourth, the form of labor mutual aid should gradually adapt to the characteristics and effectiveness of new agricultural tools: New agricultural tools must be used on land of more than 1,500 mu to fully exert their effectiveness and require continuous use. Mutual aid teams must solve several important problems when using new agricultural tools: First, the team leader must be capable in order to do a good job in the division of labor. Second, it is necessary to solve the problem of mutual benefit between the two groups. The ownership of agricultural tools should be determined as private. For smaller-priced tools such as cultivators and harrows, private purchases can be encouraged. For complete sets of agricultural tools, joint purchases with individual contributions can be encouraged. When repairing, the costs should be shared equally based on the land contribution. Third, the private ownership of reclaimed land should also be determined. Fourth, in order to eliminate farmers' concerns about "losing grain" when using new agricultural tools on mature land, it can be compensated for from the grain harvested from wasteland, thus creating conditions for the use of new agricultural tools on mature land. It is also necessary to promote the rental of agricultural tools to expand the scope of use of new agricultural tools to outside the group. As for the division of labor within the group, there should be two team leaders, the primary team leader to lead the division of labor and the deputy team leader to solve other problems. In addition, there should be dedicated personnel responsible for the safekeeping of agricultural tools and bookkeeping.

　　Fifth, the government's incentive policies have given us confidence in promoting new agricultural tools: The Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry gave Wang Zhentang's group two sets of horse-drawn agricultural implements, stipulating that if the effect is good after three years of use, they can be given to them free of charge, which encouraged their interest in using new agricultural tools. Due to the rewards and support of the Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has great confidence in promoting new agricultural tools. In the future, the organizational form of mutual aid teams should be determined by the use value of agricultural tools, and the effectiveness of new agricultural tools should not be limited by the form of mutual aid teams. This year, we plan to continue to promote Soviet new agricultural tools, including 2,500 to 3,000 units of corn threshers in addition to plows and harrows, and 2,500 to 3,000 units of comprehensive cultivators and harrows. We also plan to open training classes, and the manufacturing department has decided to unify specifications and centralize manufacturing.

　　黑龙江推广新式农具的成就与经验
    黑龙江省农林厅副厅长  金浪白
    一九五○年本省共推广苏联马拉农具一千二百四十四台，各种铲趟机三千八百七十五台。我们体会到推广与使用新农具是一项革命任务，也是农业生产革命的开始：
    第一、使用新农具可以减轻农民劳动强度：一九五○年准备春耕初期，首先推广搂草机。该搂草机，不但男劳力可以用，将来推广多了女劳力亦照样可以使用，并且人马不累。讷河县一个六十岁的老农说：“我种了一辈子的地，今天才看到人马分家”。克山县农具座谈会上农民纷纷反映搂草机的好使和省力。克山太平村有两台搂草机与旧农具六十辆大耙比赛，结果两台搂草机一天可搂柴十八车，六十辆大耙一天只搂一车多。铲趟机也是如此，三马一人连铲带趟一次就行，而且用不着弯腰。农事工作中以收割最苦，尤其麦收时天气苦热，用旧农具收割一人打头，后面的人紧赶，腰都直不起来，干了一天，晚上真是要“捉猫尾巴上炕”了。
    第二、使用新农具可以提高生产力，扩大耕地面积：东北农林部曾贷给王振堂组两套苏联马拉农具，一九五○年全组开荒九十七垧，合一千一百八十五亩，该组一九五○年耕地面积超过一九四九年耕地面积一百一十垧的百分之八十八强，比一九四六、一九四七、一九四八三年超过了一倍多，并使全组一共省了一千四百一十个工。王振堂那个村本来地瘠民贫，由于组织起来使用新农具，王振堂组可余粮七百石，每个劳力负担耕地一百一十四亩。讷河县王治俭组由于使用新农具，全组土地已由八十四垧增加到一百六十五垧，每个劳力负担耕地一百五十亩。
    第三、给新民主主义农村建设开辟了广阔的道路：由于新农具耙的细，铲的匀，不但可多产粮食，而且可以减少病虫灾害。播种机的使用，使二个半垅地只能播种五个苗眼，增加到十个苗眼。使用新农具给精耕细作做了保证，好多互助组由于使用铲趟机做到了四铲四趟，甚至八铲八趟。收割机割的快而齐，收割一垧（按：每垧合十五市亩）作物一般须五个工，但收割机六人四马一天可割五垧。由于新农具的推广，农民普遍要求身高力壮的耕畜，当然现在的条件也允许他们养好牛马。如王振堂组已繁殖了二十匹马，今年想买进二十五匹马，其中包括一匹洋种马，一头洋种牛。有了新农具，农民就有余力来搞副业，充分发挥劳力与半劳力的劳动，使农副业结合起来，各互助组中农副业分工，副业收入共已达东北币四百多亿元。
    根据一年来推广新农具的经验教训，我们初步的有以下几点体会：
    第一、推广新式农具必须注重质量，统一规格，集中制造：在这点上我们掌握不够，曾经犯过错误。本省已耕地约占可耕地百分之二七，可耕而未耕者尚占百分之六十，劳力较少，每一劳力须负担耕地六十亩，全年无霜期为一百二十天到一百三十天，为了不违农时，增加生产，必须解决铲趟问题，以便进行精耕细作与扩大耕地面积。去年我们的思想上是样样都想搞，质量既不好，规格又不统一，十一种农具有三十多个工厂在制造，并且争奇斗妍，各出心裁，有的竟不能使用。部分农民反映这是“坑人机”“马拉计划”。接受了这个失败的教训，去年后半年经过一、二百次的试验，研究出综合号的铲趟机，才普遍受到农民的欢迎。
    第二、开始推广时必须有重点：新农具一开始即大量推广，工作既不易掌握，群众也较难接受，不如先有重点的由互助组推广起，如王振堂组一开荒就是九十多垧，效果自然来的显著了。还有推广时领导上须亲自掌握具体领导，首先要着重打破群众与干部的思想顾虑，农民见到实利自然愿意使用。这方面以绥化、克山、讷河做的较好，县委书记与农业科长都亲自动手，特别在克山县是作为政治任务提出的。
    第三、必须学会技术，掌握技术：无论那一种新式农具的使用都有很多技术问题，去年春天我们训练了五百多个机手，并尽量使参加推广工作的同志，至少能懂得新式农具的性能。
    第四、劳动互助形式应逐渐适应新农具的特点与效能：新式农具必须在一千五百亩以上的土地上，才能充分发挥其效能。并且要求连续使用。互助组使用新农具时必须解决几项重要问题：首先领导的组长能力要强，以便搞好分工。其次要解决小组的两利问题，农具所有权方面应确定为私有，价格小的如铲趟机等可以提倡私人购买，成套农具可提倡各人出资合股购买，修理时按地作股按股均摊。其次开荒也应确定私人所有权。再次在熟地上使用新农具时为消除农民“怕少打粮食”的顾虑，可以由荒地所打粮食中补足，这样给新农具在熟地使用上创造了条件。还要提倡农具出租，使新农具的使用范围扩大到组外去。至于组内的分工应当有两个组长，正组长领导分工，副组长解决其他问题。还有农具保管与记账都要有专人负责。
    第五、在政府奖励政策下推广新农具有了信心：东北农林部给王振堂组两套马拉农具，规定使用三年如效果良好可无代价赠给，这样鼓励了他们使用新农具的兴趣。由于东北农林部的奖励与扶植，本省农林厅对推广新农具已有很大信心。此后应当由农具的使用价值来确定互助小组的组织形式，不应由互助组的形式来限制新农具的效能。今年准备继续推广苏联新式农具，除犁耙外还想推广苞米脱粒机等二千五百台到三千台，综合号铲趟机二千五百台到三千台。并计划开办训练班，自己制造部决定统一规格集中制造。
