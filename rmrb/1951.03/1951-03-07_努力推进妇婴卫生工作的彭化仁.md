Peng Huaren's efforts to promote maternal and child health work

The maternal and child health work in the first district of Lixian County, Hebei Province, has made great achievements. Many women in the district have adopted new methods of delivery. According to statistics from 1950, the 14 newly trained and old midwives in the district delivered a total of 112 babies. Only four of these babies died. Many farmers said, "The new method of delivery is really good, both the child and the mother are much safer." The great success of maternal and child health work in this district is inseparable from the efforts of Peng Huaren, the director of the district's Democratic Women's Federation.

Peng Huaren is very enthusiastic about maternal and child health work. In the autumn of 1949, she invited 14 people, including advanced women and old midwives from the village, to teach them new methods of delivery. After learning, these midwives were in high spirits and often took the initiative to deliver babies for people. Initially, some people did not believe in the new methods, and their work often encountered obstacles, which affected the work enthusiasm of some midwives. At this time, Peng Huaren constantly comforted and encouraged them, and helped them check their work. During the inspection, they found that the reason why the work could not be carried out smoothly was that there was not enough publicity to the masses. Therefore, they improved their skills on the one hand, and explained the benefits of the new method of delivery to everyone on the other. As a result, the work was developed and the midwives also increased their confidence. Some midwives said: "We must work hard to relieve the pain of our sisters." The maternal and child health work in the district has gradually developed in this way.

Peng Huaren also united and reformed many other old midwives. She often talked to the old midwives and explained the policies to them; sometimes she also acted as an assistant to the old midwives. She learned from the old midwives' work experience on the one hand, and helped them improve their delivery methods on the other. Therefore, the old midwives were very willing to cooperate with her. For example, Meng Ti, a 60-year-old woman in Leid Village in the district, was very experienced in delivering babies; but she had a high air and asked for many gifts for delivering babies. Peng Huaren persuaded her to participate in a health training class. After learning the new delivery method, Meng Ti's skills have been greatly improved. Her political consciousness has also been raised. She no longer asks for many gifts when delivering babies. The masses therefore welcome her even more. Now she has been elected as the health committee member of the village's Democratic Women's Federation. (Attached picture)

　　努力推进妇婴卫生工作的彭化仁
    河北省蠡县第一区的妇婴卫生工作，有很大成绩。该区许多妇女已经采用新法接生。据一九五零年统计，该区十四个受过训练的新旧助产员，共接生小孩一百十二个。这些小孩中仅有四个死亡。许多农民说：“新法接生真好，孩子和大人都平安多了。”该区妇婴卫生工作这样大的成绩，是和该区民主妇女联合会主任彭化仁的努力分不开的。
    彭化仁对妇婴卫生工作很热心。一九四九年秋，她邀集村里的先进妇女和旧接生婆等十四人，教授她们新法接生。这些助产员经过学习以后，情绪很高，常主动地替人家接生。最初有些人不相信新办法，她们的工作常常遇到阻碍，以致有些助产员的工作情绪受影响。这时，彭化仁就不断地安慰和鼓励她们，并帮助她们检查工作。她们在检查中找出工作不能顺利开展的原因是对群众宣传不够。因此，她们就一方面提高技术，一方面向大家解释新法接生的好处。于是，工作得到发展，助产员也增加了信心。有的助产员说：“咱们一定好好地去工作，给姐妹们解除痛苦。”该区的妇婴卫生工作就这样逐步地开展起来。
    彭化仁还团结和改造了其他不少旧接生婆。她常找旧接生婆谈话，并向她们解释政策；有时还给旧接生婆当助手。她一方面学习旧接生婆的工作经验，一方面帮助她们改进接生法。因此旧接生婆很愿意和她合作。如该区累德村六十岁的孟体老大娘，接生很有经验；但架子很大，替人家接生要许多礼物。彭化仁劝她参加了卫生训练班。孟体老大娘学习了新接生法后，技术上得到很大改进。她的政治觉悟也提高了。接生时她也不要许多礼物了。群众因此也更加欢迎她。现在她已被选为该村民主妇女联合会的卫生委员。（附图片）
