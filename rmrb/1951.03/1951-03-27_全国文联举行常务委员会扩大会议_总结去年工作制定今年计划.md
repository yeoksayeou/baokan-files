The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Held an Expanded Meeting of the Standing Committee to Summarize Last Year's Work and Formulate This Year's Plan

The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held its seventh expanded meeting of the Standing Committee on March 5th. The meeting was attended by Vice Chairmen Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, and more than 20 standing committee members and national committee members in Beijing. The meeting summarized the main work of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1950 and adopted the main points of the work plan for the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1951.

Regarding the work of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1950, the meeting's summary is as follows:

First, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles promoted the establishment of literary and art organizations in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities. Currently, all major administrative regions (except East China) have successively established federations of literary and art circles. More than 60 regions at the provincial and municipal levels have established federations of literary and art circles or preparatory organizations. The representatives' conferences of literary and art workers convened in various places and the federations of literary and art circles produced by these conferences have been able to achieve consistency in basic principles, affirmed the practical achievements of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, determined the common direction of efforts for all literary and art workers; broadly united people from all aspects of the literary and artistic circles, forming a united front on literary and artistic work; emphasized the popularization of literature and art, paying attention to promoting mass literary and artistic activities; strengthened creation, and launched criticism. Some regions, such as the Northwest, Southwest, and Inner Mongolia, particularly emphasized the development of the literature and art of fraternal ethnic groups.

Second, the "Call for Launching Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Work in Literary and Art Circles" issued by the Sixth Expanded Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles received an extremely wide response. Under this call, literary and art circles in various places carried out large-scale propaganda work, promoting the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles established an organization for the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Committee, compiled and printed the "Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Literary and Art Pamphlet Series," and held joint performances of Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea operas through the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

Third, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles promoted the publication of literary and art periodicals. There are currently 74 literary and art publications in the country, of which popular publications focusing on popularization account for about seven-tenths. The production and publication of various literary and artistic works are increasing day by day, and the quality is also improving. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' official newspaper, "Literary Gazette," as well as the official newspapers of the national associations of literary, art, drama, and music workers: "People's Literature," "People's Fine Arts," "People's Drama," and "People's Music," have also played different degrees of role in improving literary and artistic thought, selecting works, launching criticism, expanding the connection between literature and art and the masses, and guiding local literary and artistic publications.

Fourth, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles carried out various social and political activities, such as protesting against various reactionary measures of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, and in 1950 adopted various forms to issue instructions to the national literary and art circles regarding defending world peace, strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship, organizing literary and art workers to participate in land reform, and assisting in the work of the National Congress of Labor Heroes and Combat Heroes.

Fifth, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in coordination with the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, prepared and established the Central Institute of Literature.

Sixth, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent its representatives to attend the World Peace Congress; and gradually established regular exchanges and connections in literature and art with countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, North Korea, Hungary, and Japan.

The main shortcomings in the work of 1950 were the lack of regular and effective ideological guidance for the national literary and artistic movement, such as not doing enough in literary and artistic criticism, organizing literary and art workers to carry out creation and learning, studying and guiding the popularization movement of literature and art, and enriching the content of literary and art publications.

Regarding the work of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1951, the main points of the plan adopted by the meeting are as follows:

(1) Deeply carry out patriotic propaganda in literature and art, study and summarize the achievements and experiences of the national literary and art circles in the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda; continue to compile and select excellent literary and artistic works for Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea.

(2) Convene the Second Meeting of the National Committee in May or June to summarize the situation and experience of literary and art work in various places since the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, focusing on summarizing creation issues and literary and artistic thought issues.

(3) Strengthen and adjust literary and art publications to give various literary and art publications clear tasks and divisions of labor.

(4) Check the implementation of the creation plans by literary and art workers in 1950; and strengthen the organization of literary, drama, and film creation. Award prizes for outstanding literary and artistic works in 1950.

(5) Strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought by literary and art cadres; organize the study of Chairman Mao's "On Practice"; organize regular symposiums on political and literary and artistic thought.

(6) Assist in the preparation for the work of the Literature Publishing House to promote the planning of the national literary publishing industry.

(7) Strengthen the connection with the national associations of literary, drama, film, art, music, dance, opera, and ballad workers and the federations of literary and art circles in major administrative regions and directly subordinate provinces and cities; rectify the internal organization of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and strengthen the work of the research office and other departments.

　　全国文联举行常务委员会扩大会议
    总结去年工作制定今年计划
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会于三月五日举行第七次常务委员会扩大会议，到有副主席茅盾、周扬及在京的常务委员与全国委员会委员共二十余人。会议总结了全国文联一九五零年的主要工作，并通过了全国文联一九五一年工作计划要点。
    关于全国文联一九五零年的工作，会议的总结如下：
    首先，全国文联推动了各大行政区、各省市文艺团体的成立。现在各大行政区（除华东外）均先后成立了文联，省市一级以上已有六十几个地区成立了文联或文联筹备机构。各地所召开的文学艺术工作者代表大会和由这些大会所产生的文联都能在基本方针上达到了一致，肯定了毛主席文艺方针的实践成果，确定了全体文艺工作者共同的努力方向；广泛地团结了文学艺术界各方面人士，结成文艺工作上的统一战线；强调文学艺术的普及工作，注意推动群众性的文艺活动；加强创作，展开批评。有些地区，如西北、西南、内蒙等地特别强调了发展兄弟民族的文艺。
    其次，全国文联第六次常务委员会扩大会议决议发布的“关于文艺界展开抗美援朝宣传工作的号召”获得了极为广泛的响应。各地文艺界在这一号召下进行了大规模的宣传工作，推动了反帝爱国运动。全国文联成立了抗美援朝宣传委员会的组织，编印了“抗美援朝文艺小丛书”等，并通过北京市文联举办了抗美援朝戏曲联合公演等活动。
    第三，全国文联推动了文艺报刊的出版。全国现有七十四种文艺刊物，其中以普及为主的通俗刊物约占十分之七。各种文艺作品的产生与出版，正在一天天地增多起来，质量亦有提高。全国文联的机关报《文艺报》，以及全国文学、美术、戏剧、音乐等工作者协会的机关报：《人民文学》、《人民美术》、《人民戏剧》、《人民音乐》等刊物，在提高文艺思想，选拔作品，展开批评，扩大文艺与群众的联系，指导地方文艺刊物等等方面，也起了不同程度的作用。
    第四，全国文联进行了各种社会、政治的活动，如对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的各种反动措施提出了抗议，并在一九五○年中采用各种形式向全国文艺界发出关于保卫世界和平，加强中苏友好，组织文艺工作者参加土地改革，和协助进行工农兵劳动模范大会和战斗英雄大会的工作等指示。
    第五，全国文联与中央人民政府文化部协同筹备与创办了中央文学研究所。
    第六，全国文联选派了自己的代表出席了世界保卫和平大会；并和苏联、捷克、波兰、朝鲜、匈牙利、日本……等国家逐渐建立了文学艺术方面经常的交流与联系。
    一九五○年工作中的主要缺点是对全国文艺运动还缺乏经常的有力的思想指导，如对文艺批评，组织文艺工作者进行创作和学习，研究与指导文艺普及运动，充实文艺刊物的内容等工作，都作得不够。
    关于全国文联一九五一年的工作，会议通过的计划要点如下：
    （一）深入开展文艺上的爱国主义宣传，研究与总结全国文艺界抗美援朝宣传的成果和经验；继续编选抗美援朝的优秀文艺作品。
    （二）于五、六月间召开全国委员会第二次会议，总结全国文学艺术工作者第一次代表大会以来各地文艺工作的情况和经验，着重总结创作问题和文艺思想问题。
    （三）加强与调整文艺刊物，使各种文艺刊物有明确的任务和分工。
    （四）检查一九五○年文艺工作者执行创作计划的情况；并加强组织文艺、戏剧、电影等创作。评奖一九五○年优秀文艺作品。
    （五）加强文艺干部对马列主义与毛泽东思想的学习；组织关于毛主席的《实践论》的学习；组织定期的有关政治、文艺思想的座谈会。
    （六）协助筹建文学出版社的工作，以促进全国文学出版事业的计划化。
    （七）加强对全国文学、戏剧、电影、美术、音乐、舞蹈、戏曲、曲艺等工作者协会与各大行政区、中央直属省市文学艺术界联合会的联系；整顿全国文学艺术界联合会内部组织，加强研究室和其他各部门工作。
