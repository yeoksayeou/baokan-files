Comrades Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and People's Representatives from all circles:

The First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress of All Circles has earnestly discussed and passed a special resolution on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and handling counter-revolutionary criminals. Recently, it was specifically discussed again at an enlarged meeting of the Consultative Committee, and today we are holding another meeting to discuss and deliberate. Why are we discussing this issue repeatedly? Because this is not an ordinary small matter, but a major issue. We must adopt a serious and cautious attitude, and we must have thorough discussions and consultations with people's representatives from all circles to solicit opinions from all sides, so that the major task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries becomes a joint action of the People's Government and the broad masses of the people.

Our capital, Beijing, has been liberated for more than two years. Are there still counter-revolutionaries in Beijing? Yes, there are. What about counter-revolutionary activities? Counter-revolutionary elements are still rampant, and our people and our regime are still often harassed and sabotaged by counter-revolutionary elements. This situation is something our People's Government and the two million people of Beijing cannot and should not tolerate any longer.

Recently, the Central People's Government promulgated the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, which is a legal weapon for suppressing counter-revolutionary elements. The Central People's Government has given us clearer regulations on how to be lenient and how to suppress counter-revolutionaries. We must use this weapon to strike at counter-revolutionary elements and take these regulations as the standard for sentencing counter-revolutionary criminals. In the past, we have achieved successes in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, but there were also shortcomings and mistakes. Some of the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionaries, and those who stubbornly continued to do evil after liberation, were treated too leniently. Those who should not have been treated with leniency were, those with serious crimes were given lighter sentences, and those who should have been sentenced to death were not resolutely executed. In other words, our mistake was "one-sided leniency" and "boundless leniency." This was not only dissatisfactory to the people, hindering their enthusiasm for fighting against counter-revolutionaries, but also objectively encouraged and emboldened the counter-revolutionary elements, enabling them to continue their sabotage activities. If we do not correct the mistake of "one-sided leniency" or "boundless leniency," the people will no longer forgive us. They said, "We have not truly stood up even after liberation." Indeed, those extremely heinous counter-revolutionary elements who used to oppress the people have not received the punishment they deserve, and the hidden counter-revolutionary elements have not been thoroughly eliminated. If we allow these counter-revolutionary elements to continue to be rampant and go unpunished, how can the safety of the people be guaranteed?

Judging from some of the counter-revolutionary cases we have recently uncovered, there are many extremely heinous counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to be enemies of the people and the People's Government, who have not yet been dealt with. Some are ringleaders who have been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities all along, and they all have a long history of harming the people. For example, military secret agent Li Suhou once used machine guns to shoot and kill more than 1,000 people in Yishui County, Shandong Province. Zhu Shilin arrested more than 200 revolutionary workers and progressive people in Baoding and personally strangled 15 of them. Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) agent Leng Shaoying was the culprit who beat Professor Chen Jinkun and other patriotic people and severely tortured more than 60 patriotic students in Zhongshan Park in Beijing in 1946. Military secret agent and Chief of the Military Service Section of the Puppet Civil Affairs Bureau, Li Xiaoyu, forcibly conscripted more than 10,000 soldiers for the Kuomintang reactionaries from February 1947 to June 1948. Are these guys ringleaders? I think they are. If they are not ringleaders, then we won't be able to find any even with lanterns and torches. Moreover, it would be too unfair if these counter-revolutionary elements were not considered ringleaders.

Some are counter-revolutionary elements who have continued to do evil and persist in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, specializing in sabotage, robbery, and assassination. For example, military secret agent Wang Fengchao is a well-known gun-for-hire who has killed more than 400 people in Hejian and burned down more than 1,500 houses. After liberation, he hid in this city and continued to do evil, having committed robberies eleven times. Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) agent Liu Yingnan committed robberies continuously after liberation, and burned the victims with red-hot iron bars during the robberies. Military secret agent Wang Yuheng was the mastermind behind the arson planned for National Day last year on Roosevelt Road in Tianjin and the East Railway Station in Beijing. CBS agent Dong Huachang was the leader of the Tianjin First Brigade's directly affiliated group of the "Hidden Sabotage Brigade of the Pingjin Railway," and sabotaged locomotives three times in a row. Are these people not considered incorrigible since they are still carrying out counter-revolutionary activities after liberation?

Some are bandits who conspired to organize armed riots. For example, military secret agent Chen Gongfu, after liberation, organized the "North China Guerrilla Column Headquarters," recruited traitors, habitual bandits, and stragglers, organized reactionary armed forces, and prepared to establish a guerrilla base in the Taihang Mountains, attempting to subvert the people's regime by force.

Some are leaders of reactionary secret societies who used feudal secret societies to carry out counter-revolutionary espionage activities. For example, Li Taisheng, the reactionary leader of the Jiugong Tao sect, gathered more than 5,000 followers and conspired to launch riots on February 2nd and March 3rd last year. Jin Hankui, the altar leader of the Jiugong Tao sect, specialized in creating rumors against the government, insulting the government, and advocating a third world war to promote the interests of American imperialism. He personally created and wrote seven volumes and more than 90 kinds of counter-revolutionary rumors that were seized. Wang Dianrong, the altar leader of the Yiguandao sect, was a secret agent of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), and also a traitor and puppet Baojia chief. He had arrested more than 100 young people and handed them over to the enemy during the enemy's puppet rule.

Some are local bullies. For example, Wang Tingshu, a local bully in Nancaoyuan, nicknamed "Southern Tyrant" and "King of Hell," had served as a secret agent for the Japanese Military Police, arrested more than 40 patriotic students, seized Xia Tonghe's land, forced people to death, and beat local residents. The bully Yan Wenhui was one of the three major hooligans in the western suburbs, a member of the Kuomintang, and had joined the Bafangdao and Yiguandao sects. He served as the Baojia chief and military service squad leader for the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. He had grabbed more than 80 civilians for the Japanese invaders and conscripted soldiers three times for the Jiang bandits, and raped nine women. Can we tolerate such counter-revolutionary bully elements?

Some are habitual bandits who have consistently committed robberies with guns. For example, the habitual bandit Cai Jixian gathered people to commit robberies four times after liberation, strangling two victims to death. The habitual bandit Yang Xingshou committed robberies four times, strangling one victim to death and stabbing one victim to death. Some habitual bandits committed robberies seventeen times in a row, and some habitual bandits committed robberies thirty-two times in a row.

Many counter-revolutionary elements continue to engage in sabotage after being treated leniently. For example, Qin Peng, one of the bandits from the "North China Guerrilla Column Headquarters," participated in a military intelligence organization and engaged in criminal activities while on bail for labor. Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) agent Zhang Youmin was captured in Northeast China and released to Beijing. After that, he contacted military secret agent Han Fang and secretly wrote intelligence to supply the Jiang bandits. Some counter-revolutionary elements are still engaged in sabotage in prisons and labor camps. Some collude with detained secret agents and bandits in prison to organize a "Martyr Comrades Association" and develop military secret agent organizations. Some conspire to seize guns and launch riots. Some, during detention, not only do not repent, but also dream of how to treat our staff, who are now painstakingly working with them, with "machine gun roll calls" when the US-Chiang forces return in the future. Some do not write in their diaries how to repent and bow their heads to the people, but write that they must "fight to the end" with us. Some sabotage production tools and machines during labor reform. Some of those under control also take advantage of our one-sided leniency to make false registrations, hide guns and radios, and insist on continuing counter-revolutionary activities. At the same time, some of these counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated our factories and schools to carry out sabotage. For example, two secret agents who had been "major generals" became our drivers and cooks. American imperialist spy Zhu Liangyun infiltrated the Ministry of Trade as a recorder to steal our state secrets. Military secret agent and major general group leader of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, Xie Quecheng, infiltrated the Normal University to carry out sabotage activities. Yang Shoud, commander of the "Ji-Cha-Re Border Region Advance Column," who attempted to launch an armed rebellion, also pretended to be progressive and infiltrated our democratic parties. Counter-revolutionary elements have already infiltrated our ranks, infiltrated our factories, schools, and organizations. Some have been discovered, and some have not yet been discovered. They have burrowed into our bellies. Their intentions are despicable, but also vicious and insidious.

Comrades, you probably feel that I have said a lot already, but I have only mentioned a part of the many criminals.

These counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to be enemies of the people and the People's Government are all extremely hated secret agents, bandits, and counter-revolutionary elements. Moreover, many of them continue to do evil after liberation, or even after being treated with leniency, and engage in various sabotage activities. Almost every one of them has several criminal identities, having served as traitors, secret agents, bandits, and puppet Baojia chiefs, and at the same time, they are all dregs such as bullies, landlords, thugs, and hooligans. They trample on the people, commit all kinds of evil deeds, commit countless sins, kill countless people, seize land and houses, conscript soldiers and laborers, rape women, defraud money, and spread rumors to confuse the public, causing great losses to the lives and property of the people. Therefore, the people of Beijing constantly accuse these counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes to the government. They say, "If we are lenient again, we will not be able to survive," complaining that the government "Why doesn't the government stand up for us," "Why is it always lenient," and reminding the government, "If we are lenient again, the counter-revolutionary elements will rebel." We believe that the people's opinions are correct. If we are lenient again, the counter-revolutionaries will really rebel. We cannot tolerate it any longer. (Applause)

Fellow representatives! Shouldn't we immediately accept the opinions of the broad masses of the people and act according to their opinions? Shouldn't we give the most severe punishment to those extremely heinous and incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements? We should resolutely and mercilessly punish those counter-revolutionary criminals. Everyone's opinion is right, we should resolutely suppress them. If we don't suppress them, we will suffer even more. Comrades! If we want to consolidate the victories that the people have already achieved, if we want to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, if we want the construction work of Beijing to proceed smoothly, if we want the broad masses of the people to live and work in peace and contentment, then we must thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities (slogan). And resolutely suppressing the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionaries is a necessary step to thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities (applause). At the same time, those counter-revolutionary elements who continue to do evil after being treated with leniency should also be severely punished, and there should be no more leniency (slogan, applause), because further leniency will only embolden the counter-revolutionaries and make our country and people pay a greater price in blood and sacrifice. Can we do this? We have to do this. Everyone knows that the Chinese people have shed countless blood in order to liberate themselves and overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This victory was won by the heroic struggle of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. After liberation, when the people and the People's Government lacked experience in fighting the hidden enemies, were not vigilant enough, and the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements was not resolute enough, our people paid a considerable price in blood again. Haven't we shed enough blood now? Should we still tolerate counter-revolutionary elements killing the people and harming the country? Should we still be lenient to those counter-revolutionary elements with wolfish ambitions? No! We can't do that! We can't be lenient! On the contrary, we should resolutely overthrow the counter-revolutionaries! Thoroughly eliminate them! (Applause, slogans) Then, does our current policy towards counter-revolutionaries only talk about suppression and not about leniency? No, it doesn't. It is said that some people have had this view, but in fact this is an unnecessary misunderstanding. Our policy has always been a combination of suppression and leniency, and it is still a combination of suppression and leniency now. This is our basic policy. For those who have committed serious crimes but have now sincerely repented and performed meritorious service for the people, for those who were coerced into participating in counter-revolutionary activities, or for those whose counter-revolutionary crimes before liberation were not serious, and who have indeed repented after liberation and severed ties with counter-revolutionary organizations, they were treated with leniency in the past, and they are still treated with leniency now. In this respect, today is still the same as in the past, and there is no change. For example, we are about to release more than 100 people, and we have already lifted the control of a large number of controlled elements. In the future, we will still give lenient treatment to those general reactionary elements who sincerely repent and bow their heads to the people and admit their guilt. According to Chairman Mao's instructions: We should work on them and work very hard to transform them into new people. But we can only and should only be lenient to these people. For those counter-revolutionary ringleaders who have committed heinous crimes, for those secret agents and spies who have continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, for those counter-revolutionary elements who have committed evil again after being treated with leniency, for the habitual bandits, bullies, and reactionary secret society leaders with serious crimes, for these extremely heinous, incorrigible, and incurable counter-revolutionary elements, we cannot be lenient to them, and we should severely suppress them. Because if we are lenient to them, our country will suffer and the people will suffer. But in the past, we mistakenly treated them leniently, which objectively amounted to condoning them to do evil, condoning them to harm the people and endanger the fruits of the revolution. We must resolutely suppress these counter-revolutionary elements and must quickly correct the bias of boundless leniency.

There is another question: Will suppression cause panic? In the past, when the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," Comrade Peng Zhen's report had already answered it. The actual facts in Beijing have also proved that his answer was completely correct. The people's reaction after the execution of 58 counter-revolutionary criminals not long ago is the best answer to this question. Not only did the people not panic, but they unanimously praised the government for doing a good job. They said, "The government is eliminating violence for the people, and it is very satisfying." "The matter was handled well, but it was handled late." "These people should have been killed long ago." "The 58 people who were shot were all extremely heinous." They also asked, "Why haven't some other extremely heinous counter-revolutionary elements been executed yet?"

Are there people who are panicking? We say yes. Who is panicking? Secret agents and bandits are panicking. Under the power of resolute suppression, they are "pale as earth and trembling all over." We are "radiant with joy and cheering for ten thousand years." Is it good that they are "pale as earth and trembling all over"? I say it is a good thing. They should tremble. It would be bad if they were radiant with joy and cheering for ten thousand years. Some secret agents and bandits who had refused to repent in the past have handed over their hidden guns, bullets, and radios. This is the benefit of being "pale as earth and trembling all over"! Some who were determined to fight to the end with the people in the past now say that they will honestly perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Not only has it forced some counter-revolutionary elements to repent and reform, reducing their harm to the people and society, but also, by voluntarily handing over weapons and radios, etc., they have obtained lenient treatment with lighter penalties. If there were no suppression, these people would still be continuing to use radios, sending telegrams, and engaging in anti-people activities. If they continued to do so, they would not be able to obtain lenient treatment with lighter penalties in the future, and might be beheaded. Therefore, resolutely suppressing the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionaries is a good thing, first of all for the people, and also for those general reactionary elements who have turned back in panic. Isn't it? Some of those who are panicking because the government is resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries are general party and league members and coerced elements of reactionary parties and groups. They are coerced elements, but they still did not bow their heads or admit their guilt in the past, and were still hiding and evading, pretending that nothing was wrong. This time, as a result of their panic, they hurriedly went to the government to register and guarantee that they would "break away from the counter-revolutionaries." This reduced the chances of them being used by the counter-revolutionaries and saved a group of coerced elements who could have been saved. Isn't this also a good thing?

Some people are afraid that the people's secret reports will wrong good people and implicate innocent people. This concern is necessary, well-intentioned, reasonable, and legitimate, but it is also unnecessary. The purpose of the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries is to protect the people, and the attitude towards handling counter-revolutionary cases is serious and cautious, and we will never wrong good people. We attach great importance to the people's secret reports, but we will never arrest people or kill people based on one or two anonymous letters. We mainly rely on investigation and research, and rely on evidence to handle cases. The people's secret reports are only one aspect. At the same time, we will also prevent counter-revolutionary elements from harming good people. Therefore, we carefully investigate and review all secret reports, and will never handle them carelessly. Of course, our public security personnel at all levels must do this with a very responsible attitude and a serious and cautious attitude, and we must never allow carelessness. At the same time, we also ask people from all walks of life to supervise our work and make suggestions at any time. If we do this, I believe that there will be no major deviations. In short, we will never implicate a good person, nor will we let go of a counter-revolutionary element.

The purpose of our resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries is to protect the fruits of the revolution, protect the safety of the people's lives and property, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and prepare the necessary conditions for defending economic construction and for the large-scale construction work in our country in the future. Therefore, we must resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary elements that should be suppressed. Those who have already been treated with leniency but continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities will no longer be treated with leniency. Only by doing so can we meet the interests of all the Chinese people and the interests of the 2.2 million people in the capital. Therefore, I request the representatives attending the meeting to fully assist us in completing this major task. I believe that the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the 2.2 million people will work together and will definitely be able to thoroughly eliminate the sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries. Let those counter-revolutionaries panic in front of us! Let those counter-revolutionaries tremble in front of us!

    彻底肃清反革命的破坏活动
    ——北京市公安局罗瑞卿兼局长在市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议上的报告市长、副市长、各界人民代表同志们：
    关于镇压反革命和处置反革命罪犯问题，北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议，曾经切实地讨论过，并且作出了专门的决议，最近，在协商委员会扩大会议上又专门讨论了一次，今天再一次请大家开会，来商量，来讨论。为什么我们翻来覆去地讨论这个问题呢？因为这不是一件普通的小事情，而是一个重大的问题，我们必须采取既严肃又谨慎的态度，必须与各界人民代表进行充分的讨论与商量，征求各方面的意见，使镇压反革命这样一件重大的工作，成为人民政府与广大人民的共同行动。
    我们的首都北京，已经解放两年多了，北京还有没有反革命呢？还有。反革命活动怎么样呢？反革命分子仍然很猖獗，我们的人民和我们的政权，仍然常常受到反革命分子的骚扰和破坏。这种情况，我们人民政府和北京市二百万人民，实在不能够、也不应该再容忍了。
    最近中央人民政府公布了惩治反革命条例，这是一个镇压反革命分子的法律武器。对反革命分子怎样宽大、怎样镇压，中央人民政府给我们规定得更明确了，我们要拿这个武器来打击反革命分子，拿这个条例作为我们惩治反革命罪犯量刑的标准。过去我们在镇压反革命分子的工作上，是有成绩的，但是也有缺点，有错误，对有些反革命的首要分子，和解放后仍然坚决继续作恶的反革命分子，处理得太轻，把不应该宽大的宽大了，有重罪的判轻了，应当处死刑的没有坚决处死，就是说我们的错误是“片面宽大”和“宽大无边”，这不但为人民群众所不满，妨害了人民群众对反革命进行斗争的积极性，在客观上，对反革命分子是一种纵容和鼓励，助长了他们的气焰，使他们能够继续进行破坏活动。如果我们再不纠正“片面宽大”或“宽大无边”的错误，人民群众就再不能原谅我们了。他们说：“解放了，我们还没有真正翻身。”的确，过去那些压在人民头上的罪大恶极的反革命分子，还没有得到应有的惩罚，潜伏的反革命分子，还没有彻底清除，如果任凭这些反革命分子继续猖獗，逍遥法外，人民的安全如何能够保障呢？
    从我们最近清理出来的一些反革命案件来看，就有许多坚决与人民为敌、与人民政府为敌的罪大恶极的反革命分子，到现在还没有处理。有些是一贯进行反革命活动的首恶分子，他们都有长期残害人民的罪恶历史。例如军统特务李肃侯，曾经在山东沂水县用机关枪射杀过群众一千多人。朱士林在保定逮捕过二百多个革命工作人员和进步群众，并亲手勒死了十五个。中统特务冷少颖是一九四六年在北京中山公园殴打陈瑾昆教授和其他爱国人士，严刑拷打爱国学生六十多人的凶手。军统特务、伪民政局兵役科长李效愚在一九四七年二月到一九四八年六月，为国民党反动派强迫抓兵一万多人。这些家伙们，算不算首恶分子呢？我想是算的，假如他们不算首恶，那么打着灯笼火把也找不到了，而且这些反革命分子如果都不算作首恶也未免太不公平了吧。
    有些是解放后仍然怙恶不悛、继续进行反革命活动的反革命分子，专门从事于破坏、抢劫与暗杀。例如军统特务王凤巢是一个有名的黑枪手，曾经在河间杀害过四百余人，烧毁过民房一千五百多间，解放以后潜伏本市，继续作恶，曾经结伙行抢十一次；中统特务刘英男，解放后连续行抢，并在行抢时用烧红的铁条烙伤事主；军统特务王玉恒，是去年国庆节准备在天津罗斯福路和北京东车站放火的主谋人；中统特务董化昌是“平津路潜伏破坏总队”天津第一大队直属分组长，一连三次破坏机车。像这些人在解放后仍然进行反革命的活动，难道不算是怙恶不悛吗？
    有些是阴谋组织武装暴动的匪首。例如军统特务陈公黻，在解放后组织“华北游击纵队司令部”，搜罗汉奸、惯匪、散兵，组织反动武装，准备在太行山建立游击根据地，企图以武装颠覆人民政权。
    有些是利用封建会道门进行反革命特务活动的道首。例如九宫道反动道首李泰成，纠合道徒五千余人，阴谋在去年二月二日、三月三日举行暴动；九宫道坛主金汉魁专门制造反对政府、侮辱政府、鼓吹三次大战为美帝国主义张目的谣言，由他亲手制造写成的反革命的谣言，被搜出来的就有七大本、九十多种；一贯道坛主王殿荣是中统特务，又是汉奸、伪保甲长，曾经在敌伪统治时期抓捕青年百余人，交给了敌人。
    有些是恶霸。例如南草园恶霸王廷枢，外号“南霸天”、“阎王爷”，曾经当过日本宪兵队特务，抓捕爱国学生四十余人，霸占夏同和的土地，逼死人命，毒打当地居民；恶霸阎文辉是西郊三大流氓之一，是国民党员，加入过八方道、一贯道，充当日寇和国民党反动派的保甲长和兵役分队长，曾经给日寇抓去民夫八十余人，给蒋匪抓兵三次，强奸过九个妇女。像这样反革命的恶霸分子，我们还能容忍他们吗？
    有些是一贯持枪行抢的惯匪。例如惯匪蔡继贤，解放后聚众行抢四次，勒死事主两人；惯匪杨星寿行抢四次，勒死事主一人，扎死事主一人；有的惯匪一连行抢十七次，有的惯匪一连行抢三十二次。
    有许多反革命分子经过宽大以后，还继续进行破坏。例如“华北游击纵队司令部”匪犯之一的秦鹏，在保释在外的劳动期间又参加了军统特务组织进行罪恶活动；中统特务张友民在东北被俘，释放来北京后，又与军统特务韩放取得联系，密写情报供给蒋匪。有些反革命分子在监狱中、在劳动改造中还在进行破坏；有的在监狱内串通在押的特务匪徒组织什么“蒙难同志会”，发展军统特务组织；有的阴谋夺枪暴动；有的在拘禁期间，不但不悔改，而且梦想什么在将来美蒋重来时，要“用机关枪点名”的手段来对待现正在苦口婆心地向他们进行工作的我们的工作人员。有的日记本上不是写着怎样悔过，怎样向人民低头，而是写着一定要与我们“周旋到底”；有的在劳动改造中破坏生产工具、机器。管制的分子中也有一些利用我们片面宽大，进行假登记，隐藏枪支、电台，坚持继续进行反革命活动。同时，这些反革命分子有的已经混入了我们的工厂、学校，进行破坏。例如有两个当过“少将”的特务做了我们的司机和厨子；美国帝国主义间谍朱良云混入贸易部当了记录员窃取我们的国家机密；军统特务、中美合作所少将组长谢厥成混入了师范大学进行破坏活动；企图进行武装暴乱的“冀察热边区挺进纵队”司令杨守德，也假充进步，混到我们民主党派里来了。反革命分子，已经打到我们的队伍里面，混进我们的工厂、学校、机关，有些已经被发现，有的还没有被发现。他们钻到我们的肚子里来，他们的企图是可耻的，但是也是毒辣的、阴险的。
    同志们，你们大概已经感到我已经讲得很多了，但我只是说了许多罪犯中的一部分事例呢。
    像这样坚决与人民为敌、与人民政府为敌的反革命分子，都是人民极为痛恨的特务、匪徒反革命分子，而且其中有很多人在解放后甚至在经过宽大后还继续作恶，还进行各种破坏活动。他们几乎每一个人，都兼有几种罪恶的身份，当过汉奸、当过特务、当过土匪、当过伪保甲长，同时又都是一些恶霸、地主、兵痞、流氓等败类，他们踩在人民头上，为非作歹，造下了无数的罪恶，杀害了无数的人民，霸占了土地房屋，抓兵抓夫，强奸妇女，诈骗钱财，造谣惑众，使人民的生命财产遭受了很大的损失。因此，北京市的人民不断向政府控诉这些反革命分子的罪行，他们说：“如果再宽大，我们就活不了了”，埋怨政府“为什么不给我们作主”，“为什么总是宽大”，并且提醒政府说：“要是再宽大，反革命分子就要造反了”。我们认为人民的意见是正确的。我们如果再宽大，反革命就真造反了，我们是不能够再忍受了。（⑴⑶）
    各位代表同志们！难道我们不应该马上接受广大人民的意见并按照他们的意见办事吗？难道我们不应该给那些罪大恶极怙恶不悛的坚决反革命分子，以最严厉的惩治吗？我们应该坚决地毫不容情地惩治那些反革命罪犯。大家的意见是对的，应该坚决镇压，如果不镇压他们，我们就要吃更大的苦。同志们！如果要巩固人民已经取得的胜利，要巩固我们的人民民主专政，要使北京的建设工作得以顺利进行，要使广大人民得以安居乐业，那我们就必须彻底肃清一切反革命的破坏活动（口号）。而坚决镇压反革命的首恶分子，则是彻底肃清一切反革命破坏活动的必要步骤（鼓掌）。同时对于那些经过宽大仍然作恶的反革命分子也要严厉惩治他们，绝不能再宽大了（口号、鼓掌），因为再宽大下去只会助长反革命的气焰，只会使我们的国家和人民付出更多的流血和牺牲的代价。我们能不能这样办呢？我们不能不这样办。大家都知道，中国人民为了自求解放，为了推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，已经流了无数的鲜血，这个胜利，是千千万万中国人民优秀的儿女的英勇斗争换得来的。解放以后，当着人民和人民政府对隐藏的敌人还缺乏斗争经验、警惕不高、对反革命分子镇压不够坚决的时候，我们的人民又付出了不少血的代价，难道我们现在血流得还不够吗？难道还应当容忍反革命分子来杀害人民危害国家吗？难道我们对那些狼子野心的反革命分子还要宽大吗？不！不能这样！我们不能宽大了，相反地我们应该坚决地打倒反革命！彻底地肃清他！（掌声、口号）那末，我们现在对待反革命的政策，是不是只讲镇压，不讲宽大了呢？不是的。据说有些人曾经有此看法，其实这是一个不应该有的误解。我们的政策从来就是镇压与宽大相结合的，现在也还是镇压与宽大相结合的，这乃是我们的基本政策。对于那些虽然有过严重罪行，而现在确已真诚悔改并为人民立功的分子，对于那些曾经被迫参加反革命活动的胁从分子或者解放前反革命罪行并不重大，解放后又确已悔改，并与反革命组织断绝联系的分子，过去是宽大处理，现在还是宽大处理，在这方面，今天和过去仍然一样，并无改变。譬如说：我们就要释放一百多人，过去已经解除了一大批被管制的分子，今后对于那些诚心悔改并向人民低头认罪的一般反动分子，我们还是要给他们以宽大处理。依照毛主席的指示：向他们做工作并且做得很用心，把他们改造成为新人。但是我们只能够也只应该宽大这些人，对于那些罪大恶极的反革命首要分子，对于解放后怙恶不悛继续进行反革命活动的特务间谍分子，对于那些经过宽大后又再作恶的反革命分子，对于罪恶严重的惯匪、恶霸、反动会道门头子，对于这些罪大恶极死有余辜不可救药的反革命分子，是不能宽大的，是应该予以严厉镇压的。因为宽大了他们，我们国家就要受害，人民就要遭殃。但过去却错误地宽大处理了，客观上等于纵容他们为恶，纵容他们残害人民，危害革命的胜利果实，我们必须对这些反革命分子实行坚决的镇压，必须迅速纠正宽大无边的偏向。
    还有一个问题：镇压会不会引起恐慌？过去中央人民政府颁布《惩治反革命条例》的时候，彭真同志的报告已经回答过了。北京的实际事实，也证明了他的回答是完全对的。不久以前处决了五十八个反革命罪犯以后，群众的反映就是对于这个问题最好的回答。人民不仅没有恐慌，而且一致地称赞政府做得好，他们说：“政府为人民除暴，大快人心。”“事情办得好，就是办迟了。”“这些人早就该杀。”“枪毙的五十八个，都是罪大恶极的。”他们并问：“还有一些罪大恶极的反革命分子为什么还不处决？”
    有没有人恐慌呢？我们说有。什么人恐慌呢？特务匪徒是恐慌的。在坚决镇压的威力下面，他们“面如土色，混身发抖”。我们是“满面红光，欢呼万岁”。他们“面色如土，混身发抖”好不好呢？我说是好事，他们应该发抖，他们要是满面红光，欢呼万岁就坏了。有些过去死不悔改的特务匪徒，把隐藏的枪支、子弹、电台缴出来了，这就是“面如土色，混身发抖”的好处！有些过去抱定主意要和人民周旋到底的，现在表示要老老实实立功赎罪了。不仅迫使一些反革命分子悔过自新，减少了他们对人民和社会的危害，而且由于自动缴出武器、电台等，获得从轻处置的宽大待遇。如果没有镇压，这些人还是继续搞电台，发电报，从事反人民的活动。他们这样搞下去，将来就不可能获得从轻处置的宽大待遇，也许会杀头。所以坚决镇压反革命的首恶分子，这是一件好事，首先对于人民是好事，对于这些恐慌得回了头的一般反动分子，也是好事。难道不是吗？还有一些因为政府坚决镇压反革命而发生恐慌的，是一些反动党团的一般党、团员和胁从分子，他们是胁从分子，但他们过去还是不低头，不认罪，还躲躲闪闪，表面装没事，这一回，他们恐慌的结果，是急忙到政府来登记，保证“与反革命一刀两断”，这样就减少了他们被反革命所利用的机会，挽救了一批本可挽救的胁从分子。这岂不也是一件好事吗？
    有人恐怕群众密告会冤枉好人，牵连无辜，这种关心是应该的、善意的、有理由的、正当的，但又是不必要的。人民政府坚决镇压反革命的目的，是为了保护人民，处理反革命案件的态度是严肃的，谨慎的，绝不冤枉好人。人民的密告，我们是很重视的，但是，决不会根据一两封告密信去捉人，去杀人，我们主要是依靠调查研究，依靠证据来办事的，人民的密告仅是一方面。同时，我们还会防止反革命分子伤害好人，因此，我们对于告密的信件都是慎重地加以调查研究与审查，绝不会草率处理。当然，我们各级公安工作人员必须以十分负责的态度、严肃谨慎的态度来这样做，绝不准许粗心大意。同时我们也要求各界人民监督我们的工作，随时提出意见。这样做，我相信就不会发生大的偏差。总之，我们是决不牵连一个好人，也决不放走一个反革命分子。
    我们坚决镇压反革命的目的是在于保卫革命的胜利果实，保护人民生命财产的安全，巩固人民民主专政，并为保卫经济建设，为我国今后大规模的建设工作准备必要的条件。所以必须坚决镇压一切应该镇压的反革命分子。有的已经宽大，又继续进行反革命活动的，决不再宽大了，这样做才符合全中国人民的利益和首都二百二十万人民的利益，因此我请求到会的代表全力协助我们完成这个重大的任务。我相信北京市人民政府和二百二十万人民，共同行动起来，一定能够彻底肃清反革命的破坏活动，叫那些反革命在我们面前恐慌吧！叫那些反革命在我们面前发抖吧！
