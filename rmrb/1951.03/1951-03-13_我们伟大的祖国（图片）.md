    Our Great Motherland
    This is the largest bronze ding (鼎) unearthed from the Yin Dynasty in Anyang, Henan. It is currently housed in the Nanjing Museum. It weighs over 1,400 jin (approximately 700 kg), is 137 cm tall with handles (one handle is missing), 110 cm long, and 77 cm wide. The four sides of the ding are decorated with thunder patterns as the background, with coiled dragon patterns above, and taotie (饕餮)纹 patterns at the four corners. Inside the ding, there is an inscription of three characters: "Si Mu Wu" (司母戊). It is one of the great works of art created by our people three thousand years ago.
