  In early 1948, the Chinese People's Liberation Army had already launched a nationwide offensive. However, Shanghai, the largest city in the Far East, was still under the rule of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. At this time, the so-called "U.S. Military Advisory Group" was still here supporting the collapsing Kuomintang reactionaries; while Chairman Mao's great proclamation, "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and the PLA's victorious advance, powerfully shook the "U.S. Military Advisory Group" and the puppet rulers here.
  The PLA's offensive situation, coupled with the intensifying oppression of the people by the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, led to a climax in the mass movement in the enemy-occupied areas. Shanghai residents, suffering from the brutal oppression of the U.S. military and the puppet government, witnessed a series of "Dance Tides," "Student Tides," and "Labor Tides." The contradictions within the enemy also became increasingly acute, with mutual attacks, further exposing their frantic struggles. At the same time, they showed that they were very afraid of the revolutionary forces among the workers.
  At this time, the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai was always breathing with the workers, concerned about their interests, watching and leading their struggles. Under such circumstances, the Party estimated that the People's Liberation Army had begun its offensive and that victory would come soon. However, to achieve victory, it was necessary to go through a more arduous process. Therefore, it was necessary at this time to raise the political consciousness of the workers, further strengthen their unity, avoid all unnecessary losses, accumulate strength, and prepare to coordinate with the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, welcome liberation, protect factories, and welcome the victorious tomorrow.
  Zhang Shifang (played by Sun Zheng), the Communist Party branch secretary of a certain Shanghai textile factory, met with the comrade (played by Zhou Lai) who led her at her home and received the above work instructions. Upon leaving, she met Peng Xiaomei (played by Li Ming), the younger sister of worker Peng A'mei (played by Bai Yang), who had been released from the puppet police station in the Dance Tide case. They discussed at Peng A'mei's house and decided to introduce Xiaomei back to the factory to resume her work.
  However, the enemy's exploitation intensified daily. At this time, the secret agent leader Zhou Gaoming used the meager rationed rice and coal briquettes that workers depended on for survival as his "campaign funds" in order to "run for" a seat in the puppet Legislative Yuan, and tricked workers into handing over their ID cards to conduct "voting," which aroused the anger of the workers. A sharp struggle began: after their minimum demands were not met, the workers resolutely went on strike.
　　　The masses' struggle was so irrepressibly enthusiastic and high-spirited. Under such enthusiastic struggle sentiments of the masses, the worker leader Zhang Shifang, according to the Party's instructions, resolutely and rapidly organized and united the masses, led and supported the masses in this struggle, and also made some arrangements to strictly prevent enemy suppression, striving to prevent the workers from suffering losses. The Party's prediction was correct: the enemy's cruel offensive indeed began! The bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek ordered a bloody suppression of the workers, with armored vehicles, flying fortresses, armed troops and police launching a full-scale attack on unarmed workers. Faced with such a situation, the worker mass leader Zhang Shifang had two paths: one was to more calmly persuade the workers, use her "legal status" in front of the puppet city party department party hack Zhou Gaoming to strive for negotiations, and use the greatest force to avoid losses to the workers; the other was to immediately lead the masses to resolutely resist. As a result, driven by the enthusiasm of the mass revolutionary struggle at that time, Zhang Shifang quickly took the latter path, immediately leading the workers to bravely resist. After a short battle, workers were killed and injured, and suffered losses. The young sister of the female worker Peng A'mei, Xiaomei, bravely used her body to block the enemy's armored vehicle and sacrificed herself under the wheels. Zhang Shifang's younger brother, Xiao Zhang (played by Zhang Yan), and the worker Lao Fang (played by Tie Niu), as well as other workers, were also arrested.
  However, the Shanghai underground organization of the Communist Party immediately launched a sympathetic strike by Shanghai workers to rescue the workers who were massacred in Zhang Shifang's factory. This united action by workers inside and outside the factory forced the enemy to retreat in panic! At the same time, because of the reactionary faction's bloody massacre of workers, it aroused widespread anger among the people of Shanghai. The people of Shanghai broadly expressed their condolences and support for these workers, and strongly protested against the Kuomintang reactionaries' mad slaughter. These actions powerfully educated the entire working masses and made the workers and students even more united. Through this incident, all the people more clearly recognized the cruel crimes of the Kuomintang bandits, and the executioner bandits were completely isolated in front of the people of Shanghai. Instead, the mass movement and revolutionary forces grew stronger!
  The Party led Zhang Shifang and the worker comrades and students, enabling the masses' revolutionary movement to advance victoriously, and step by step realized the general policy of accumulating strength to await the opportunity in the workers' movement in the enemy-occupied city of Shanghai at that time. In the summer of 1948, Shanghai launched an anti-American and pro-Japanese movement, led by students. The huge parade demonstration, shouting slogans of "Oppose the U.S. Imperialists' Support for Japan!" and "U.S. Imperialists Get Out of China!" The magnificent mass action once again hit the deceptive policies of the U.S. State Department here. "Nothing can divide the unity of the Chinese people -- a frightened U.S. military advisor was forced to urgently report to the State Department in Shanghai -- a huge change is happening and developing in China!"
  Next, in the spring of 1949, the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and advanced to the outskirts of Shanghai. The Chiang-American bandit gang was shamefully thrown into chaos. They妄想 wanted to carry out the last and most cruel plundering and destruction in Shanghai, attempting to occupy factories with arms, transport and loot, and sabotage them. However, what they encountered at this time was none other than the Shanghai worker comrades, who had always been under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party: they had long accumulated and prepared their strength, established their own mass armed and semi-armed organizations—the People's Security Team, smashed the enemy's conspiracy, and completely protected their factories.
  At the meeting of the People's Liberation Army and the Shanghai workers, the Shanghai Party organization of the Chinese Communist Party, which had been leading the workers' struggle, pointed out to everyone: "Since the Shanghai people, with a long revolutionary tradition and a high degree of awareness, have been able to unite, fight bravely and stubbornly, and achieve victory in the past under difficult circumstances; in the future, under the people's own regime, they will certainly be able to overcome difficulties, not rely on imperialism, and build our own country well! Today, as the People's Security Team, we cooperate with the Liberation Army to liberate Shanghai; tomorrow, when we return to our production posts, we will be a great production army, and we will definitely be able to continue to complete our glorious task for strengthening our national defense and building our prosperous motherland!"

    《团结起来到明天》
    上影·故事片

  一九四八年初，中国人民解放军早已转入了全国规模的进攻，但远东最大的城市——上海，还在被美帝国主义的走狗蒋匪帮统治着。这时候，所谓“美军顾问团”，还在这里支持快要崩溃的国民党反动派；而毛主席发出的伟大文告“目前形势和我们的任务”，和解放军的胜利进军，都有力的震动了“美军顾问团”，和这里的敌伪统治者。
  解放军进攻的形势，美蒋反动派对于人民加紧的压迫，引起了敌占区群众运动进入高潮。上海居民因受到美军和伪政府的残酷压迫，“舞潮”、“学潮”、“工潮”迭起。他们内部的矛盾也日益剧烈，互相攻击，另一面更暴露了他们疯狂的挣扎。同时也显出他们对工人方面的革命力量是非常害怕。
  这时候，中国共产党上海党的地下组织，随时都和上海的工人们呼吸在一起，关切工人的利益，注视和领导着工人的斗争。在这样情况下，党估计了人民解放军开始转入了进攻，胜利不久就会到来，但达到胜利，还必须经过一段更加艰苦的过程，因此，就必须在这个时候，提高工人的政治觉悟，进一步加强工人的团结，避免一切无谓的损失，积蓄力量，准备配合人民解放军的胜利进攻，迎接解放，保护工厂，迎接胜利的明天。
  中国纺织厂某厂的共产党支部书记张世芳（孙琤饰），在她家与领导她的同志（周来饰）碰头，得到以上工作指示后，出门，碰见了工友彭阿妹（白杨饰）的妹妹彭小妹（李明饰）在舞潮案里被伪警局释放出来。她们在彭阿妹家商量，决计把小妹介绍回工厂，恢复做工的职业。
  可是敌人的压榨却日胜一日。此时，特务头子周高明为了“竞选”伪立法委员，把纱厂工人赖以活命为数甚微的配给米和配给煤球拿去做他的“活动经费”，并且骗缴工人的身份证去进行“投票”，引起了工人的愤怒，尖锐的斗争开始了：工人们在提出最低要求没有答复以后，就坚决的罢了工。
　　　群众的斗争情绪是那样难以遏止的热烈和高涨，工人领袖张世芳，在群众这样热烈的斗争情绪下，根据了党的指示，一面坚决迅速地组织和团结群众，领导和支持群众进行这次斗争，同时也做一些严防敌人镇压的布置，力使工人不遭受损失。党的预见是正确的：敌人残酷的进攻果然就开始了！匪首蒋介石命令向工人无情地展开血腥镇压，装甲车，飞行堡垒，武装的军队和警察向徒手的工人全面进攻，在这样的情势面前，工人群众领袖张世芳有两条路：一条路是要更冷静的说服工友，利用自己在伪市党部党棍周高明面前“合法的身份”，去争取谈判，用最大的力量去避免工人的损失；另一条路，是即时领导群众坚决抵抗；结果，当时他被群众革命斗争的热情所推动，张世芳迅速地走了后一条路，即刻领导工人英勇的进行了反抗，在短短的战斗后，工人有了死伤，遭受到损失，女工彭阿妹的妹妹小妹，英勇的以自己身体挡住敌人的铁甲车，牺牲在车轮下。张世芳的弟弟小张（张雁饰），和工人老方（铁牛饰）还有其他的工人们，也被捕了。
  可是共产党上海地下组织，即刻就发动了上海工人同情性的罢工，来援救了张世芳工厂被惨杀的工人。厂内外工人们这一个团结的行动，打得敌人只得仓惶地撤兵了！同时，由于反动派这样对工人血腥的屠杀，引起了全上海人民普遍的愤怒，上海人民对这些工人们广泛的慰问和支援，对国民党反动派的疯狂屠杀表示了强烈的抗议，这些行动都有力地教育了全体工人群众，并且使工人学生们更加团结起来了。经过这一事件，全体人民更加清楚地认识到国民党匪徒的残酷罪行，刽子手匪徒们完全在上海人民面前孤立了，群众运动和革命力量反而壮大起来！
  党领导着张世芳和工人同志们以及学生们，使群众的革命运动胜利前进，便在当时上海这敌占城市的工人运动中步步实现了积蓄力量，以待时机的总方针。四八年夏，上海又以学生为首展开了反美扶日运动，巨大的游行示威的行列，高喊着“反对美帝扶植日本！”“美帝滚出中国去！”的口号。波澜壮阔的群众行动，又一次地打击了美国国务院在这里的欺骗政策。“没有任何东西可以分裂中国人民的团结——惊惶失措的美军顾问在上海这样被迫地向国务院紧急报告道——一个巨大的变化在中国发生，发展！”
  接着，一九四九年春人民解放军百万雄师胜利渡长江，推进到上海近郊，蒋美匪帮可耻的乱成一团，他们妄想在上海进行最后也是最残酷的一次掠夺和破坏，企图武装占领工厂进行搬运抢夺和破坏，可是他们这时候碰到的却不是别人，而是历来在中国共产党坚强领导下的上海工人同志们：他们早已积蓄和准备了力量，建立了自己群众性的武装和半武装的组织——人民保安队，粉碎了敌人的阴谋，完整的保护下自己的工厂。
  在人民解放军与上海工人胜利会师的大会上，一直领导工人斗争的中国共产党上海党组织，向大家指出：“有长久革命传统和高度觉悟的上海人民，过去既然在艰苦的环境之下，能够团结一致，英勇顽强地坚持斗争，取得了胜利；今后在人民自己的政权之下，也一定能够克服困难，不依赖帝国主义，建设好我们自己的国家！我们今天作为人民保安队，配合解放军，解放了上海；明天，我们回到生产岗位，就是一支生产大军，一定能够为增强我们国防力量，为建设我们富强的祖国，继续完成光荣的任务！”
