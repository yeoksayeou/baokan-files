Capital Youth Students and Young Workers Actively Report Hidden Special Agents

[Our Newspaper] After studying the reports and documents on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the vast number of young people in schools and factories in Beijing have generally raised their vigilance, overcome complacency, and actively reported hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

The teachers and students of Fu Jen Catholic University unanimously supported the government's arrest of Li Lunying, a hidden special agent in the school. The students said, "In the past, two special agents at Fu Jen Catholic University were discovered by the Public Security Bureau, and we didn't know about them. We must be more vigilant in the future!" Students and members of the Communist Youth League at Labor Middle School did not pay attention to reactionary elements singing Kuomintang party songs or seeing reactionary slogans and pictures on campus in the past. Recently, everyone has become more vigilant. Communist Youth League members such as Zhang Xiaolian took the lead in reporting the special agent Li Zhenru and found pocket-sized secret bomb drawings and many secret letters. Students from Northern Jiaotong University and Beijing Railway Institute actively participated in the school's picket team. Students from the Heavy Industry School suggested that the school administration inspect the laboratory, strictly implement the entry and exit and visitor system, and organize a school picket team to ensure school safety. Some young workers at the Waterworks Company spent half an hour after get off work to inspect the workshops. Some students and workers from Beijing Normal University proposed: "Strengthen anti-theft, fire prevention, and anti-poisoning work." After seeing the special agent crimes published in the newspaper, especially the arson case by special agents in Lingling, Hunan, and the special agent's conspiracy to shell Tiananmen Square during last year's National Day, the majority of students and workers in schools and factories deepened their hatred of counter-revolutionary elements and realized that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is not just a matter for the public security department, but also for the broad masses of the people.

Many young people have taken the initiative to report the activities of counter-revolutionary elements to relevant parties, and many members of the Communist Youth League have reported counter-revolutionary elements among their relatives. Wang Shaoan, a member of the Communist Youth League at Tsinghua University, had a father who served as a high-ranking official in the Chiang Kai-shek police bureau. Recently, he was arrested by the government. Wang Shaoan wrote a report about his father's past counter-revolutionary behavior and sent it to the local public security bureau. Another member of the Communist Youth League had an older brother who was a special agent. He recently ran away. He wrote to his brother, asking him to confess his crimes to the government, and also reported the matter to the public security bureau. A fourth-year student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, a member of the Communist Youth League, persuaded his father to hand over his guns. Niu Rujiang, a member of the Communist Youth League at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, found that after the government strengthened the suppression of counter-revolutionary work, a worker suddenly became negative in production. As a result, he learned that he had done intelligence work for the Kuomintang special agent organization and quickly reported it to the public security department. Wang Sheng, a member of the Communist Youth League at the Telecommunications Bureau, assisted the people's police in catching a saboteur who cut the power lines. In addition, Communist Youth League members or students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Heavy Industry School, Xinsheng Boys' and Girls' Middle School, Hebei Provincial Normal School, Hebei High School, Labor Middle School, and Yenching University have all reported or persuaded counter-revolutionary elements among their relatives and friends to surrender themselves.

　　首都青年学生青年工人积极检举暗藏特务
    【本报讯】北京市各学校、工厂广大青年学习了有关镇压反革命的报告和文件后，普遍提高了警惕，克服麻痹思想，积极检举暗藏的反革命分子。
    辅仁大学师生一致拥护政府逮捕该校暗藏特务分子李伦英。同学们说：“过去辅仁大学的两个特务，都是公安局发现的，我们并不知道，今后一定要提高警惕！”劳动中学的同学和青年团员，过去听到校内反动分子唱国民党党歌，看到反动标语、图画，都不注意；最近大家提高了警惕，青年团员张效联等并带头检举了特务李振茹，搜出袖珍秘密炸弹图样和秘密信件多封。北方交通大学北京铁道学院的同学积极参加了校内的纠察队；重工业学校同学建议学校行政方面检查实验室，严格执行进出门及会客制度，组织学校纠察队以保障学校安全。自来水公司一些青年工人下班后，还花半小时的时间去检查工房。北京师范大学有些同学、工友提出：“加强防盗、防火、防毒工作”。多数学校、工厂的学生和工人看到报上发表的特务罪行，特别是湖南零陵特务放火案和去年国庆节特务阴谋炮击天安门等消息后，都加深了对反革命分子的仇恨，认识到镇压反革命不只是公安部门的事，而且是广大人民群众的事。
    许多青年都主动向有关方面报告反革命分子的活动情况，很多青年团员检举了自己亲属中的反革命分子。清华大学青年团员王少安的父亲曾任蒋匪警察局要职，最近被政府逮捕，王少安便写了一份材料报告他父亲过去的反革命行为，寄给当地公安局；另一位青年团员的哥哥是个特务，最近逃跑了，他便一面写信给他哥哥，要他向政府认罪，一面又把这事报告公安局；该校电机系四年级一个青年团员劝自己的父亲交出枪支。石景山钢铁厂青年团员牛如江发现当政府加强镇压反革命工作以后，一位工友忽然生产消极起来，结果了解到他曾为国民党特务组织做过情报，便迅速报告了公安部门。电信局青年团员王升协助人民警察捉到了一个割电线的破坏分子。此外，中央美术学院、重工业学校、新生男、女中学、河北省立师范、河北高中、劳动中学、燕京大学等校都有青年团员或同学对自己亲属朋友中的反革命分子，加以检举或劝其自首。
