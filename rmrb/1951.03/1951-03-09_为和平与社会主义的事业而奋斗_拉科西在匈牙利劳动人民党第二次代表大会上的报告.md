　　Strive for the Cause of Peace and Socialism
     -- Rakosi's Report at the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, Budapest] Budapest dispatch: The following is a summary of the report by Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, at the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party:
    The characteristic of the current international situation is the increasing advantage of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union against the US imperialists and their lackey states. US imperialism and its lackey states are afraid of peaceful competition with socialism; in the Far East, they have adopted a policy of open military aggression, while the Soviet Union is making rapid progress in all aspects.
    The achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have further developed the struggle of the working people in capitalist countries against their own capitalism and against the instigators of imperialist wars. The victory of the Chinese revolution is clear evidence of the growth and consolidation of the peace camp.
    The life-and-death struggle of the Korean working people against the American aggressors not only proves that the people are able to defend freedom, but also proves that the colonial era has come to an end, and a new era has begun for the oppressed in colonies and semi-colonies.
    The Hungarian people have expressed in various ways their sympathy for the Korean working people, standing with them in the struggle against the imperialist barbarians, and are confident that the Korean people will win in this just war.
    We are particularly concerned about Yugoslavia and Germany within the imperialist camp. For hundreds of years, the fate of the Yugoslav people has been the same as that of the Hungarian people, and the instigation of the oppressors has made us hostile to each other. The Hungarian people once imagined that after the Horthyites were eliminated, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, they could build a socialist future together with the Yugoslav people in peace and brotherhood.
    When the Hungarian people learned of the criminal policies of the Yugoslav leaders from the resolution of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau in the summer of 1948, they were deeply shocked. The Tito elements immediately colluded with the Greek royalist fascists to drown the Greek people's liberation struggle in blood. The Tito group also maliciously slandered the victorious Chinese revolution and the Korean people's war of liberation, released the Yugoslav fascists, canceled the Five-Year Plan, and gradually handed over the Yugoslav army to the US imperialists.
    We fully sympathize with the Yugoslav patriots who are fighting against the Tito gang, and their struggle will sooner or later eliminate the Tito gang.
    For hundreds of years, our motherland has been a victim of plunder by German conquerors. The Hitler bandit occupiers plundered our country, but every Hungarian welcomed the establishment of the German Democratic Republic with joy and excitement, hoping that this would be the beginning of the development of the entire German people and the entire country along the path of democratic progress. On the other hand, we are dissatisfied with the attempts of the Western imperialists to restore militarism and fascism in West Germany.
    Since last October, Hungary has conducted more than a hundred diplomatic activities. We have jointly protested with the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in Prague against the imperialist conspiracies in Germany. We will continue to struggle unremittingly on the peace front and will not hesitate to sacrifice for the cause of peace.
    The characteristic of our domestic situation is the unity of the Hungarian working people, which is the result of a long and unwavering struggle against the remnants of the old exploiters. The elections of people's representative conferences at all levels demonstrated the complete unity of the national and democratic forces of our country's working people.
    Now our industrial production has doubled compared to 1938, and we are able to produce many things that Hungary has never produced before. In 1950, the output of our socialist industry increased by 35 percent compared to 1949, which means that the development in one year was greater than the development in twenty years during the capitalist period. The living standards of workers and staff have increased by 87 percent compared to 1938. The wage fund increased by 3 billion forints (Hungarian currency unit) in 1950, and the average wage of workers in December 1950 increased by 59 forints compared to 1949. National income increased by 20 percent in 1950, which means that the increase in one year was greater than the increase during the twenty years of Horthy's rule. The basic investment in the first year of the Five-Year Plan was almost equal to the total basic investment during the Three-Year Plan. We originally planned to allocate 51 billion forints for the basic investment of the Five-Year Plan, but this was too low. We have formulated a new plan, which requires basic investment to reach 80 to 85 billion forints. In 1950, we overfulfilled the already expanded plan by 109.6 percent. Labor productivity increased by 20 percent, which is twice as much as originally stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. According to the new plan, the basic investment in heavy industry, steel industry, and electrical industry will increase many times. We invested 37 to 38 billion forints in heavy industry, which is more than double the original plan.
    In 1949, we planned to increase industrial production by 86.4 percent during the Five-Year Plan. According to the new plan, industrial production will double, and heavy industry will almost quadruple. In the light industry sector, the original plan stipulated an increase of 73.9 percent, but now it has increased by 150 percent. Our new plan stipulates an increase of 40 percent in the basic investment in agriculture, which is an increase of 10 billion forints, part of which will be used to build 220,000 new houses. Our revised plan requires an increase of 600,000 to 650,000 new workers and staff, including 11,000 engineers (this number is more than all the engineers we had at the beginning of the Five-Year Plan) and 17,000 technicians.
    The new plan stipulates that national income will increase by 120 percent, while the original plan only stipulated an increase of 63 percent.
    In the construction of modern enterprises, the Soviet Union has assisted us, providing us with the latest machines, telling us the latest working methods, and sending the best technicians and workers to help us work. We review the production achievements of our working class with gratitude and pride, and we should also give due evaluation to the excellent work of our intellectuals. Socialist construction has begun in agriculture. Today, more than 250,000 people are participating in the work of the socialist sector in agriculture. This number is increasing rapidly. At present, there are 361 agricultural machinery stations. At the end of 1950, we had 6,895 agricultural production cooperatives. 29,000 people work at agricultural machinery stations. State-owned farms have increased by 53 percent since last year, with a total cultivated area of 570,000 holds. This year, 119,000 farmers (a total of 160,000 people) have established 206 new agricultural production cooperatives on 826,500 holds of cultivated land.
    Our working people feel and recognize that the regime belongs to them and that the state serves their interests.
    The First Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party was the starting point of our people's democracy and socialist construction. New tasks are now before us, and we have all the basis for achieving greater success. We will do everything in our power to use all our possibilities to strive for the happiness of our people and to better strive for the cause of peace and socialism.

　　为和平与社会主义的事业而奋斗
     ——拉科西在匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会上的报告
    【新华社讯】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西在匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会的报告摘要如下：
    目前国际形势的特点，是以苏联为首的反对美帝国主义者及其仆从国家的和平阵营的优势日益增长。美帝国主义及其仆从国家害怕与社会主义进行和平竞赛；在远东，它们已采取了公开军事侵略的政策，苏联却在各方面都在飞速地进步着。
    苏联及人民民主国家的成就，促使资本主义各国劳动人民反对本国资本主义、反对帝国主义战争挑拨者的斗争获得了进一步的发展。中国革命的胜利是和平阵营的壮大与巩固的明证。
    朝鲜劳动人民反对美国侵略者的生死斗争，不仅证明人民是能够保卫自由，并且证明了殖民时代已告结束，殖民地与半殖民地被压迫者的历史新纪元开始了。
    匈牙利人民以各种方式表示：他们同情朝鲜劳动人民，与朝鲜人民站在一起进行反对帝国主义野蛮人的斗争，并且确信朝鲜人民在这一正义的战争中必将获得胜利。
    我们特别关心帝国主义阵营中的南斯拉夫和德国。数百年来，南斯拉夫人民的命运都是与我们匈牙利人民相同的，压迫者的煽动曾使我们互相敌视。匈牙利人民曾经设想在霍尔梯分子被消灭后，在苏联领导下可以与南斯拉夫人民共同在和平与兄弟友善的情况中建立社会主义的将来。
    当一九四八年夏天匈牙利人民从共产党与工人党情报局的决议中得知南斯拉夫领导者们的犯罪政策时，他们深感惊愕。铁托分子立即与希腊保皇法西斯分子勾结，把希腊人民的解放斗争淹没在血泊中。铁托集团并对胜利的中国革命和朝鲜人民的解放战争进行了恶意的诽谤，释放了南斯拉夫的法西斯分子，取消了五年计划，逐渐地把南斯拉夫的军队交给美帝国主义者。
    我们完全同情对铁托匪帮进行斗争的南斯拉夫爱国分子，他们的斗争迟早会把铁托匪帮消灭掉。
    我们的祖国，在数百年来一直都是德国征服者掠夺下的牺牲者。希特勒匪帮占领者曾掠夺了我们的国家，但每一个匈牙利人都欢欣兴奋地欢迎德意志民主共和国的成立，期望这将是德国全体人民与整个国家沿民主进步的道路发展的开端。另一方面，我们不满地注视着西方帝国主义者要在西德恢复军国主义与法西斯主义的企图。
    自去年十月起匈牙利进行了一百次以上的外交活动。我们曾在布拉格与苏联及人民民主国家的代表共同抗议过帝国主义在德国的阴谋，我们将在和平阵线上继续不断地努力斗争，并将不惜牺牲为和平而斗争。
    我们的国内形势是以匈牙利劳动人民的团结为其特点，这个团结是长期坚持不渝地反对旧剥削者残余的斗争的结果，各级地方人民代表会议的选举表现了我国劳动人民的民族、民主力量的完全团结一致。
    现在我们的工业生产已比一九三八年增加了一倍，我们已能出产许多匈牙利从未生产过的东西。一九五○年我们的社会主义工业的产量较一九四九年增加百分之三十五，这就是说一年之间比在资本主义时期二十年的发展还大。职工生活水平已比一九三八年提高了百分之八十七，工资基金在一九五○年间增加了三十亿福林（匈币制单位），一九五○年十二月份工人的平均工资比一九四九年增加了五十九福林。一九五○年国民收入增加了百分之二十，就是说一年中比霍尔梯统治二十年的时期中增加的还多。五年计划第一年基本投资几乎等于三年计划时基本投资的总数。我们原拟拨作五年计划基本投资的五百零十亿福林太低了，我们制定了新的计划，这计划要求基本投资达八百到八百五十亿福林。我们在一九五○年以百分之一百零九点六的比例超额完成了已经扩大了的计划。劳动生产率增加了百分之二十，这比原先五年计划所规定的多一倍。依照新的计划，重工业、炼钢工业、电气工业的基本投资将增加许多倍，我们以三百七十至三百八十亿福林投入了重工业，即比原先的计划多一倍。
    一九四九年我们曾计划工业生产在五年计划期间增加百分之八十六点四，按照新计划，工业生产将增加二倍，重工业则几乎增至四倍。在轻工业方面，原先的计划规定增加百分之七十三点九，现在则增加了百分之一百五十。我们的新计划规定农业的基本投资增加百分之四十，即是增加一百亿福林，其中一部分将用来建筑二十二万所新住宅。我们修正了的计划要求增加六十到六十五万新的职工，其中一万一千人为工程师（这数目比五年计划开始时我们所有的工程师为多），一万七千人为技师。
    新计划规定国民收入增加百分之一百二十，原定的计划只增加百分之六十三。
    在建设现代化的企业中，苏联给我们以协助，供给我们最新式的机器，告诉我们最新的工作方法，派最好的技师与工人帮助我们工作。我们满怀感激与骄傲的心情来检阅我国工人阶级的生产成就，同时也应该对我们知识分子的优良工作给以应有的评价。社会主义建设已在农业中开始了。今天已有二十五万多人参加了农业中的社会主义部分的工作。这一数目正在急剧增加中。目前农业机器站已有三百六十一个，一九五○年底我们已有了六千八百九十五个农业生产合作社。农业机器站有二万九千人工作，国营农场自去年起增加了百分之五十三，其耕地共有五十七万霍尔特。今年有十一万九千户农民（共十六万人）在八十二万六千五百霍尔特的耕地上建立了二百零六个新的农业生产合作社。
    我国劳动人民感到并认识到政权是属于他们的，并且国家是为他们的利益服务的。
    匈牙利劳动人民党第一次代表大会是我们人民民主及社会主义建设的起点。现在摆在我们面前的是新的任务，我们有着获致更大的成功的一切基础。我们将竭尽全力，以便利用我们所有的可能来争取我们人民的幸福，更好地为和平与社会主义的事业奋斗。
