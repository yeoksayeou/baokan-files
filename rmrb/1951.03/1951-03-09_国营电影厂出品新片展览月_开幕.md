　　"National Film Studio New Film Exhibition Month" Opens
　　The opening ceremony of the "National Film Studio New Film Exhibition Month" in Beijing was solemnly held on the 7th under the auspices of Minister Shen Yanbing of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. More than 1,000 people, including cultural and artistic figures in Beijing, representatives of various agencies and organizations, and foreign guests, attended the ceremony.
　　Minister Shen Yanbing delivered the opening speech first. He said: In 1950, the three state-owned film studios in Northeast China, Beijing, and Shanghai overfulfilled the original plan by producing 26 feature films, 3 animated films, 2 joint Sino-Soviet color documentaries, 13 large and medium-sized documentaries each, 26 short documentaries, 43 translated feature films, 42 translated educational shorts, and 60 issues of New China News. This is a major event in the cultural construction of New China. These films all have correct and positive ideological themes, and they have all grasped the creative method of neo-realism. Because of the ideological and artistic advantages of our films, American films, which used to dominate the Chinese film market, were completely eliminated by the end of last year. This is a great victory in the struggle against American imperialist cultural aggression.
　　Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, also spoke at the meeting. He particularly praised the spirit of hard struggle of the people's film workers in overfulfilling their tasks, and encouraged them to continue to work hard to improve their ideological, political, and technical levels.
　　Film music programs were also performed at the meeting, and the excellent film "New Children's Heroes" of 1950 was screened.
　　After the opening of the exhibition month, from March 8th, 26 new films will be screened one by one in 60 cinemas in 20 cities across the country, one film per day. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　“国营电影厂出品新片展览月”开幕
    北京“国营电影厂出品新片展览月”开幕典礼，七日在中央人民政府文化部沈雁冰部长主持之下隆重举行。参加典礼的有在京的文化艺术界人士、各机关、团体代表以及各国来宾等一千余人。
    沈雁冰部长首先致开幕词。他说：国营东北、北京、上海三个电影制片厂一九五○年超过原计划制作了故事片二十六部，美术片三部，和苏联合制的五彩记录片二部，大型及中型记录片各十三部，小型记录片二十六部，翻译故事片四十三部，翻译教育短片四十二本，新中国简报六十号。这在新中国文化建设事业上是一件大事。这些影片都具有正确的积极的思想主题，也都把握住了新现实主义的创作方法。由于我们影片在思想上和艺术性上的优点，使过去曾经在我国电影市场上占优势的美国影片，到去年底已经完全被肃清了。这在反对美国帝国主义文化侵略的斗争中，是一个很大的胜利。
    政务院文化教育委员会马叙伦副主任也在会上讲话。他特别表扬了人民电影工作者艰苦斗争超额完成任务的精神，并勉励他们继续努力提高思想、政治及技术水平。
    会上亦演奏了电影音乐节目和放映了一九五○年的优秀影片“新儿女英雄传”。
    展览月开幕后，自三月八日起，将有二十六部新片逐一在全国二十个城市的六十家电影院中放映，每天一部。（新华社讯）
