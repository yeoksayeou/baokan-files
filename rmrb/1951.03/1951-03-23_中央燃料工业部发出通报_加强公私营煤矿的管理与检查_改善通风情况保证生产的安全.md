Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry issued a circular on the 20th to the coal mine management departments of all levels of people's governments, to strengthen the management and inspection of public and private coal mines. The circular pointed out that as the weather warms up, natural ventilation mines are prone to pressure balance between the inside and outside of the mine, which leads to ventilation difficulties and makes them most susceptible to gas accidents. In order to ensure the safety of coal mine production, the coal mine management departments of the people's governments at all levels should order the persons in charge of various public and private coal mines to implement the "Key Points for Safety Production Management of Public and Private Coal Mines" approved and promulgated by the Central Finance and Economics Committee on October 20, 1950, and should immediately strictly inspect and conscientiously implement the following regulations:

	I. Each mine must have at least one exhaust shaft and one intake shaft, otherwise it should be suspended. It shall not resume work until it is connected with other mines to establish a ventilation system.

	II. Each working face underground must have an intake airway and a return airway, and always maintain sufficient air volume. The air volume shall be based on the principle of three cubic meters per minute per underground worker.

	III. In order to prevent spontaneous combustion and air leakage, the mined-out areas must be sealed with stone, brick, lime and other materials.

	IV. Organize a safety production committee or inspection team to be responsible for the inspection and treatment of methane and coal dust, ventilation control, and pay special attention to ventilation and gas conditions when the temperature and pressure change. Necessary measures should be taken in case of wind reversal.

	V. For all permitted earth kilns, if the natural ventilation volume is insufficient, a local hand-cranked fan should be added.

　　中央燃料工业部发出通报
    加强公私营煤矿的管理与检查
    改善通风情况保证生产的安全
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部于二十日通报各级人民政府煤矿管理部门加强对公私营煤矿的管理与检查。通报指出，目前天气转暖，自然通风矿井容易发生矿井内外气压平衡现象，以致通风困难，最易发生瓦斯事故。为保证煤矿生产的安全，各级人民政府的煤矿管理部门应责成各公私营煤矿主管人，贯彻执行一九五○年十月二十日中央财政经济委员会批准颁布的《公私营煤矿安全生产管理要点》并应立即严格检查和认真执行下列规定：
    一、各矿井至少须有一个出风井及一个入风井，否则应予停工。在未与其他矿井接透建立通风系统之前，不得复工。
    二、井下每一工作面必须具有进风道及回风道，经常保持足够风量，风量以井下工作人员每人每分钟三立方公尺为原则。
    三、为防止自然发火及漏风，对已采区必须用石、砖、石灰等物施行封闭。
    四、组织安全生产委员会或检查小组，负责沼气、煤尘之检查处理，通风管制，特别注意气温气压变化时的通风情况及瓦斯情况，遇有倒风现象应采取必要措施。
    五、凡准许开采之土窑，自然通风风量不足者，应增设局部手摇扇风机。
