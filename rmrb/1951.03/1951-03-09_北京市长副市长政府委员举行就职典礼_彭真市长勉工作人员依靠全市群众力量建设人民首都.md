[Beijing City News Agency Report] The Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and Government Committee Members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, elected by the Third Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, have taken office in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. An inauguration ceremony was held at 2:00 PM on March 8th in the Zhongshan Hall of Zhongshan Park. Attending the ceremony were Mayor Peng Zhen, Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, and Government Committee Members Xiao Ming, Shu Sheyu, Xue Zizheng, Wang Wenbin, Ma Yuhuai, Weng Dujian, Liu Ren, Wang Feiran, Chai Zemin, Xu Chubo, Liang Sicheng, Mou Zexian, Cheng Hongyi, Li Yonglu, Lei Jieqiong, Yan Jingqing, Xue Yu, Li Guorui, Le Songsheng, Zheng Yun, Jiao Huanwu, and more than 800 cadres above the section chief level from all units of the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

The ceremony began with the solemn national anthem. After Mayor Peng Zhen, Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, and Government Committee Members officially took office amidst warm applause, Mayor Peng Zhen delivered an inaugural speech.

In his speech, Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out: The Third First Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference has already decided on the work guidelines and tasks for the Municipal People's Government this year. In the future, the work of the Municipal People's Government will be to specifically implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference and gradually realize these resolutions. Subsequently, Mayor Peng Zhen explained some of the urgent matters to be addressed, including: (1) Formulating a preliminary plan for urban construction; (2) Further developing democratic political power; (3) Resolutely eliminating all counter-revolutionary remnants; (4) Further reorganizing industry and improving agricultural production, strengthening urban-rural exchange; (5) Addressing housing issues; (6) Launching spring epidemic prevention work and guiding and assisting factories and workshops in establishing health clinics. Mayor Peng said: The people of Beijing believe that the Municipal People's Government has made great achievements in its work last year. Carrying out this year's work on the basis of last year's work is a favorable condition for this year's work. On the other hand, although this year's fiscal revenue will be more than last year, due to the fact that the revolutionary war has not yet ended and national defense construction needs to be strengthened, this year's urban construction funds will be less than last year, which is a difficult aspect of this year compared to last year. Therefore, in order to successfully complete the arduous tasks assigned to us by the People's Representative Conference, we must require all staff to be meticulous in their calculations, put in more effort, and implement the principle of "spending less money and doing more things." Regarding the working system and working style of the Municipal People's Government, Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out: The daily work of the Municipal People's Government is under the leadership of the Mayor and the Government Committee, with the heads of each department responsible, that is, implementing the principle of "unified leadership, division of labor and responsibility, collective leadership, and individual responsibility," so that every staff member can work freely under the unified leadership of the higher authorities, so as to make our work truly vigorous. He emphasized: The staff of the People's Government are the servants of the people and also the leaders of the people. They must use various methods to listen to the opinions, demands, and calls of the people of this city, establish close ties with the people, and rely on the strength of all the people, especially the strength of the working class, to carry out various tasks. Mayor Peng Zhen called on all staff to pay attention to eliminating the remnants of bureaucracy and red tape, and to fully utilize the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, to give full play to their creativity, to constantly promote their strengths, correct their shortcomings, and improve all aspects of their work, so as to better fulfill the glorious task of building a people's capital.

Subsequently, six committee members, including Shu Sheyu, Li Guorui, Lei Jieqiong, Le Songsheng, Liang Sicheng, and Xue Yu, spoke in succession. In his speech, Committee Member Shu Sheyu enthusiastically praised Beijing as the most lovely and beautiful city in the world, and now she is the great capital of the new China. He said: The people of Beijing elected us as government committee members, which has given us infinite strength. It makes us feel that we must do more things, and it makes us have to think of every way to do a good job in the various tasks of this greatest and most democratic People's Government. Committee Member Li Guorui said: I am a worker at the Beijing Tap Water Company. Before liberation, we were "stinking workers." But now our working class is the leading class of the country. My being elected as a government committee member also signifies a major change in the old and new societies. He pointed out: Today, there are still many special agents and spies who are trying every means to sabotage our revolutionary cause. Our People's Government must severely suppress them and must eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. The six committee members who spoke at the meeting all said: They felt very honored to be elected by the people of the capital as members of the Municipal People's Government Committee. They unanimously expressed that under the leadership of Mayor Peng Zhen, Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu, and Wu Han, they will definitely strive to serve the people of the capital, live up to the trust and entrustment of the people of the capital, and successfully complete the various construction undertakings of the capital this year.

At 4:00 PM, the ceremony ended with the music of "Unity is Strength."

    彭真市长勉工作人员依靠全市群众力量建设人民首都
    【京市新闻处讯】由北京市第三届各界人民代表会议选出的北京市人民政府市长、副市长和政府委员已遵照中央人民政府政务院的批示，先行到职视事；于三月八日下午二时在中山公园中山堂举行就职典礼。参加典礼的有彭真市长、张友渔副市长、吴晗副市长、政府委员萧明、舒舍予、薛子正、王文斌、马玉槐、翁独健、刘仁、王斐然、柴泽民、徐楚波、梁思成、牟泽衔、程宏毅、李永禄、雷洁琼、严镜清、薛愚、李国瑞、乐松生、郑芸、焦寰五和北京市人民政府所属各单位科长以上干部八百余人。
    典礼在庄严的国歌声中开始。彭真市长、张友渔副市长、吴晗副市长和政府委员们在热烈的掌声中正式就职后，彭真市长发表了就职演说。
    彭真市长在演说中指出：北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议已经决定了市人民政府今年的工作方针和任务；今后，市人民政府的工作就是具体执行各界人民代表会议的决议，把各项决议逐步加以实现。接着彭真市长就当前急需举办的一些事情作了说明，其中包括：（一）拟定都市建设的初步计划；（二）进一步建设民主政权；（三）坚决肃清一切反革命残余；（四）进一步改组工业和提高农业生产，加强城乡交流；（五）关于房屋问题；（六）开展春季防疫工作，指导、帮助工厂和作坊设立卫生所问题。彭市长说：北京市人民认为市人民政府去年的工作有很大的成绩。在去年的工作基础上来开展今年的工作，这就是今年工作的有利条件。另一方面，今年的财政收入虽会比去年多，但由于革命战争尚未结束，国防建设需要加强，今年的城市建设经费将比去年少，这是今年比去年困难的一方面。因此，要胜利完成各界人民代表会议交给我们的艰巨任务，必须要求全体工作人员精打细算、多出力量、贯彻“少花钱、多做事”的方针。关于市人民政府的工作制度和工作作风，彭真市长指出：市人民政府的日常工作是在市长和政府委员会领导之下由各部门首长负责，即贯彻“统一领导，分工负责，集体领导，个人负责”的原则，使每一个工作人员在上级的统一领导下放手工作，才能使我们的工作真正朝气勃勃。他着重地说：人民政府的工作人员是人民的勤务员，又是人民的领导者；必须用种种方法听取本市人民群众的意见、要求和呼声，与人民建立密切的联系；依靠全体人民的力量，首先是工人群众的力量来进行各项工作。彭真市长号召全体工作人员注意肃清文牍主义、官僚主义的残余，并充分运用批评和自我批评的武器，发挥高度的创造性，不断地发扬优点、纠正缺点改进各项工作；更好地执行建设人民首都的光荣任务。
    接着，舒舍予、李国瑞、雷洁琼、乐松生、梁思成、薛愚等六位委员相继讲话。舒舍予委员在讲话中热情地歌颂北京是世界上最可爱、最美丽的城市，而现在她是新中国伟大的首都。他说：北京人民选举我们作政府委员，这就给了我们无穷的力量；它使我们感到非多做些事情不可，使我们不得不想尽办法来做好这最伟大、最民主的人民政府的各项工作。李国瑞委员说：我是北京市自来水公司的一个工人。解放前，我们是“臭工人”。而现在我们工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，我当选为政府委员，这也表明了新旧社会的一大变化。他指出：今天还有很多特务、间谍在千方百计地破坏我们的革命事业，我们人民政府必须严厉地镇压他们，必须肃清一切反革命分子。在会上讲话的六位委员都说：这次被首都人民选举为市人民政府委员会的委员，感到十分光荣。他们一致表示：在彭真市长、张友渔副市长、吴晗副市长领导之下，一定努力为首都人民服务，不辜负首都人民的信任和委托，胜利完成首都今年各项建设事业。
    下午四时，典礼在“团结就是力量”的乐声中结束。
