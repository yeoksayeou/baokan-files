　　Kunming County, Yunnan Province, Establishes Joint Government of All Ethnic Groups
    The Kunming County People's Joint Government Committee of All Ethnic Groups was established on the 19th of last month at the Second People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles in the county. This is the first county in Yunnan Province to establish a people's joint government of all ethnic groups. The county is inhabited by eight ethnic groups, including Han, Yi, Hui, Miao, and Minjia, totaling 230,000 people. In the year since the county's liberation, the revolutionary order has been consolidated, and the people's political awareness has significantly improved. The county has also cultivated outstanding cadres from minority ethnic groups. 517 farmers' association branches have been established throughout the county, with more than 50,000 members. Therefore, this conference exercised the functions and powers of the County People's Congress and, according to the population proportion of each ethnic group, elected the county head, four deputy county heads, and 25 government committee members. The meeting also discussed issues such as ethnic unity and resolved to establish ethnic regional autonomous governments in areas or townships with ethnic groups in compact communities, and to establish people's joint governments of all ethnic groups in areas or townships where ethnic groups live in mixed communities.

　　云南省昆明县成立各族联合政府
    昆明县各民族人民联合政府委员会，已于上月十九日在该县第二届各民族各界人民代表会议上成立。这是云南省第一个建立各民族人民联合政府的县。该县杂居着汉、彝、回、苗、民家等八个民族共二十三万人。该县解放一年来，革命秩序已趋巩固，人民政治觉悟显著地提高。该县并培养了少数民族的优秀干部。全县成立了五百一十七个农民协会分会，会员已达五万多人。因此，这次会议代行了县人民代表大会职权，依照各民族人口比例，选出县长、副县长四人和政府委员二十五人。会议并讨论了民族团结等问题，决议在该县民族聚居的区或乡成立区、乡的民族区域自治政府，在民族杂居的区或乡成立区、乡各民族人民联合政府。
