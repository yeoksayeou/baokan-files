Readers' Letters

　　Regarding the issue of improving the theoretical and cultural level of veteran cadres:

　　Editor:

　　According to our understanding, some veteran cadres, especially worker-peasant cadres, are feeling low in morale, always feeling that they have no future and that returning home late is not as good as returning home early.

　　The main reason for this phenomenon is that some veteran cadres have a low level of theoretical and political understanding and lack education, resulting in slower progress in their work and a lack of confidence. However, these comrades possess a certain level of political awareness and working ability, and they are enthusiastic about the revolution. They also hope to strengthen their learning and improve themselves. As some people say, "The higher authorities run some schools, but we can't go to them. Besides, there are too many cadres; how can it be our turn?" Especially cadres working at the grassroots level have heavy tasks and very little time to study. The documents issued by the higher authorities are mostly instructions and circulars. Only one copy of the *Chinese Revolution Reader* is issued every six months, and there are no reference books, making it difficult to study. Therefore, criticizing veteran cadres for being backward, holding meetings for self-criticism, or even giving them disciplinary action cannot solve the problem. I suggest that the Central Committee should pay attention to improving the theoretical and cultural level of veteran cadres, formulate cadre training plans in a planned way, and universally improve their culture and theory, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and the national construction cause.

            Editor's Reply

　　Comrade Hong Yang:

　　It is very good that you have reflected the ideological situation of worker-peasant cadres and suggested paying attention to improving the theoretical and cultural level of veteran cadres. Since the old cadres of worker-peasant origin were deprived of the opportunity to receive education before participating in the revolution, and after participating in the revolution, they could not study well due to the long-term arduous and intense revolutionary war environment, therefore, the cultural and theoretical level of most of them is not high. This situation hinders their progress. The Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government have begun to pay attention to solving this problem, such as running the Renmin University of China, worker-peasant rapid secondary schools, worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools, institution schools, and after-work worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools, etc. Last year, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government also specially convened a worker-peasant education conference. The State Council issued instructions on December 14th of last year regarding the establishment of worker-peasant rapid secondary schools and worker-peasant cadre cultural supplementary schools. At the same time, the Party has continuously called for strengthening the theoretical and cultural learning of cadres on the job. Although worker-peasant rapid secondary schools and worker-peasant cadre cultural supplementary schools have not been established on a large scale at present due to the limitations of financial conditions and cadre situation, it is entirely possible and necessary to gradually increase and expand its scale in the future, so that every worker-peasant cadre has the opportunity to learn. On the other hand, these old cadres of worker-peasant origin should also appreciate the actual situation of the Party and the country today. Comrades who can stay in school should work hard to study, but those who cannot leave their jobs due to various reasons should also work with peace of mind and try to squeeze time to study. Complaining about the organization is wrong, and thinking that "I have no future, and it is better to go home early than to go home late" is even more wrong. It is hoped that these comrades themselves will have the spirit of overcoming difficulties and "forging ahead" forever, and the Party organization will give them all kinds of help.

            The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Established a Middle School Class in its After-Work School to Improve the Cultural Level of Cadres

　　Editor:

　　I am a cadre of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. In order to improve my cultural level, I am very happy to participate in the middle school class of the after-work cultural supplementary school for institution cadres; but some cadres had ideological concerns about participating in cultural learning at first. Now I will tell you about the establishment of the middle school class.

　　The middle school class officially started on February 15. There are about 200 students. Most of them have attended elementary school and have undergone long-term revolutionary struggle and hard self-study. The general situation is: the level of Chinese language is higher, arithmetic is very poor; the ability to understand is strong, the memory is poor; the reading ability is strong, the writing ability is poor.

　　When initiating the establishment of the middle school class, some cadres could not put down their airs, emphasizing that they were old and their memory was not good; or they one-sidedly emphasized work and neglected the importance of cultural learning. After the leaders repeatedly mobilized and pointed out that improving culture is the main key to improving theory and doing a good job; at the same time, the branches and administrative leaders also conducted persuasive education separately, which opened up the cadres' thinking on learning culture and they automatically signed up.

　　When the class placement test was about to be held, the students universally launched a warm-up movement, and the cultural textbooks that no one had ever cared about in the library were almost all borrowed.

　　At present, the students' learning enthusiasm is very high, and they generally use the slogan "Don't be afraid of being slow, just be afraid of standing still" to alert themselves. Now the middle school class has established strict formal systems such as classroom attendance, leave, homework, make-up classes, exams, and promotion and demotion. It is also stipulated that student representative meetings will be held once a month in order to absorb mass opinions and improve teaching methods in a timely manner. (Yin)

            Fujian's Various Institutions Attach Importance to Cadre Cultural Learning

            The Biggest Difficulty at Present is Insufficient Funding

　　After-work schools for institutions in various parts of Fujian Province were generally officially established between July and August last year. According to statistics from seven special districts, eleven after-work schools for institutions have been opened, with 59 classes and 1,578 students, accounting for one-third. All schools have implemented the system of attending classes for two hours a day and twelve hours a week. The courses mainly focus on Mandarin and arithmetic.

　　The situation of the students is complex, including worker-peasant cadres and support staff. There are Party members with more than ten years of Party membership, and there are county-level cadres, but those of worker-peasant origin account for the vast majority. Most of these comrades feel the difficulty of lacking culture in their work and urgently require to learn culture, so they show positive enthusiasm in learning. A few comrades, carrying the baggage of conceit and arrogance, take a wait-and-see attitude towards learning, and there are also individuals who hold the attitude of "it doesn't matter whether I learn or not, I am just support staff anyway," and subjectively do not work hard to learn.

　　After a period of study, comrades of general worker-peasant origin have further valued cultural learning, and from practice, they have criticized the failure emotions of "we old roughs can't learn culture," and have initially established learning confidence. For example, Comrade Wei Ligong of the Minhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office After-work School reflected: "At first, I thought learning arithmetic was more difficult than climbing to the sky, so I gave it up. After the teacher's persuasion and explanation, I tried it myself, and now I think learning arithmetic is as interesting as learning general knowledge of Chinese language." Many people who were originally illiterate are now able to recognize one or two hundred characters and can write short notes. For example, Comrade Wei Shengjun of the Provincial Government Institution After-work School wrote such a leave slip when he went on a business trip and could not come to school: "Mr. Ding, I am going to Shanghai, please take a month's leave." Although "a month's leave" is wrong, it shows that he has begun to use written language. Some comrades said that they wanted to write a letter to Chairman Mao to thank him for his concern for improving the culture of worker-peasant cadres.

　ánsito The biggest difficulty currently existing in after-work schools for institutions in various places is the issue of funding. It is not enough for the institutions to rely solely on tuition fees (without engaging in production) and subsidies, which makes it impossible to solve the problems of school buildings, teaching aids, reference materials, etc.

            While Hunting Wolves, Promoting Resistance Against America and Aid Korea

　　Editor:

　　I am telling you about my recent work.

　　Since returning from attending the National Model Workers Representative Conference, I have actively responded to the call of the local People's Government, diligently improved my wolf hunting skills, and taken on apprentices to hunt wolves, in order to eliminate harm for the local people. Now our Huai'an County (Chahar Province) has organized 30 hunting teams, with a total of 120 people. From September last year to February this year, we have killed 120 wolves, 90 badgers, and 130 weasels. Since July last year to now, there have been no incidents of wolves hurting people.

　　While hunting wolves, I also promote Resistance Against America and Aid Korea. The masses here all know that American devils are the same as the Japanese devils of the past, and they are also like the wolves in our mountains, who specialize in wanting to eat people. But our volunteers are really good at hunting wolves. As soon as they arrived in Korea, they beat the American wolves very badly. When the masses heard the news of the volunteers' victory in annihilating the enemy, whether they were sending manure to the fields, hunting wolves, or leveling wasteland, their energy increased.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　National Model Workers Representative Yu Chang (written by Zhi Zhong)

　　Editor's Note: Comrade Yu Chang's simultaneous wolf hunting and promotion of Resistance Against America and Aid Korea is a very good experience. In this way, not only can the propaganda be full of encouragement and imagery, but more importantly, it combines Resistance Against America and Aid Korea with actual work, thereby mobilizing the political enthusiasm of the masses. Comrade Yu Chang's propaganda method should arouse widespread attention.

    关于提高老干部理论文化水平问题编辑同志：
    据了解现在有某些老干部特别是工农干部情绪不高，总感觉自己没有前途、晚回家不如早回家。
    这种现象的产生，主要是由于有些老干部理论政治水平不高，没有文化，工作上进步较慢，所以信心不足。但这些同志都有一定的政治水平和工作能力，他们对革命是有热情的，他们也希望加强学习提高自己。如有人说：“上级办一些学校没有咱去的。同时干部太多，那能轮着咱呢？”特别在下层工作的干部，任务很重，学习时间很少，上级发的文件除掉指示，即是通报，中国革命读本半年发一本，还无参考书，学习是有困难的。因此对老干部光批评其落后或开会检讨，甚至给予处分，都不可能解决问题。我建议中央应注意提高老干部的理论文化水平，有计划地制订干部轮训计划，普遍地提高其文化和理论，为巩固人民民主专政和国家建设事业而努力。
                                                洪洋
            编者的答复洪洋同志：
    你反映了工农干部的思想情况并建议注意提高老干部的理论文化水平，这是很好的。党内工农出身的老干部在其未参加革命前，既然被剥夺了受教育的机会；而在参加了革命后，又因长期艰苦紧张的革命战争环境，不能很好的学习，因此他们大多数人的文化、理论水平是不高的。这种情况阻碍了他们的进步。党中央及中央人民政府已开始注意解决这个问题，如开办中国人民大学、工农速成中学、工农文化补习学校、机关学校、业余工农文化补习学校等。去年中央人民政府教育部还专门召开了工农教育会议。政务院去年十二月十四日发布了关于举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的指示。同时在党内也不断号召加强在职干部的理论与文化学习。纵然工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校在目前因受着财政状况和干部状况的限制未能大量举办，但在今后一定时间内，完全有可能和必要来陆续增加并扩大它的规模，以便每个工农干部都有得到学习的机会，另一方面，这些工农出身的老干部也应体会到今天党和国家的实际情况，能住学校的同志固然要努力学习，但如因故不能离开工作岗位的，也要安心工作并设法挤时间学习；抱怨组织是不对的，认为“自己没有前途，晚回家不如早回家”更是错误的。希望这些同志本身要有克服困难永远“勇往直前”的精神，党的组织是会给他们以种种帮助的。
            中共中央华北局为提高干部文化水平
            机关业余学校成立中学班编辑同志：
    我是中共中央华北局的一个干部。为了提高自己的文化水平，我是非常高兴地参加了机关干部业余文化补习学校的中学班；但也有一部分干部对参加文化学习，在最初是有思想顾虑的。现在把中学班成立的经过告诉你们。
    中学班在二月十五日正式开课。约有学员二百人。其中大部是入过小学，经过长期革命斗争锻炼和刻苦自学的同志。一般情况是：国文程度较高，算术很差；理解能力强，记忆力差；阅读能力强，写作能力差。
    在发起开办中学班时，一部分干部放不下自己的架子，强调自己年岁大了，记忆力不行；或者是片面地强调工作，忽视文化学习的重要性。经过领导上一再动员，指出提高文化是提高理论，做好工作的主要关键；同时，各支部及行政领导干部也分别进行说服教育，这才打通了干部学习文化的思想，自动地报了名。
    在将要举行编班测验时，学员们普遍地展开温课运动，图书馆里过去从来无人问津的文化课本，几乎抢借一空。
    目前学员们学习情绪非常饱满，普遍以“不怕慢，只怕站”的口号来警惕自己。现在中学班已制定了严格的课堂、请假、堂上作业、补课、考试及升降级等正规制度。并规定每月开一次学生代表会，以便及时吸收群众意见，改进教学方法。 （茵）
            福建各机关重视干部文化学习
            目前最大困难是经费不足
    福建省各地机关业余学校，在去年七、八月间一般均先后正式成立。据七个专区统计，已开办机关业余学校十一座，设五十九班，学员一千五百七十八人，占三分之一。各校均执行了每日上课二小时，每周十二小时的制度。课程以国语算术为主。
    学员情况是复杂的，其中包括了工农干部和勤杂人员。有十几年党龄的党员，有县级干部，但以工农出身的占绝大多数。其中绝大部分同志因在工作中感到缺乏文化的困难，迫切要求学习文化，因而学习中表现积极热情。有少数同志因背着自高自大的包袱，对学习是抱着观望的态度，也有个别人抱着“学不学反正是勤杂人员”的态度，主观上就不努力学习。
    经过了一阶段的学习后，一般工农出身的同志都进一步重视了文化学习，并从实践中批判了“咱老粗学文化学不来”的失败情绪，初步树立了学习信心。如闽侯专署机关业余学校卫立功同志反映：“起头我以为学算术比登天还难，所以就把它放弃了。经过老师说服解释，自己也就试试看，现在我觉得学算术和学国语常识一样有趣。”有许多原来是文盲的，现在已能识到一两百字，会写便条了。比如，省政府机关业余学校尉生俊同志出差不能到校时，自己写了这样一张请假条：“丁先生，我要去上海，请假一月天”。虽然“一月天”错了，但说明他已经开始会运用文字了。有的同志表示要写信给毛主席，谢谢他对提高工农干部文化的关心。
    现在各地机关业余学校存在的最大的困难，是经费问题。各机关只靠学习费（没有搞生产）与补贴是不够的，致使校舍，教学用具，参考资料等没法解决。

            一面打狼一面宣传抗美援朝编辑同志：
    我把最近的工作情况告诉你。
    自从出席全国劳动模范代表会议回来以后，我就积极地响应了当地人民政府的号召，用心提高打狼技术，并带徒弟打狼，为本地人民除害。现在我们怀安县（察哈尔省）已组织了打猎小组三十个，共有一百二十人。从去年九月到今年二月，已打狼一百二十只，獾子九十只，黄鼠狼一百三十只。从去年七月到现在，就没有发生过狼伤人的事情。
    我一面打狼，一面宣传抗美援朝。这里的群众都知道美国鬼子和过去的日本鬼子一样，也都像我们山中的狼，专门想吃人。但是我们志愿军打狼的本领真不差，他们一到朝鲜就把美国狼打得很惨。群众一听到志愿军消灭敌人的胜利消息，无论是往地送粪，打狼，整荒滩，劲儿都加大了。
                        全国劳动模范代表  俞昌（致忠代笔）
    编者按：俞昌同志，一面打狼一面宣传抗美援朝，是一个很好的经验。这样，不仅能使宣传富于鼓动性和形象性，更重要的是使抗美援朝与实际工作结合起来，从而发动了群众的政治积极性。俞昌同志的宣传方法应当引起大家普遍的重视。
