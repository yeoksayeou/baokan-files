　　Don't Let the Enemy Find Loopholes
    After Watching "The Hermit"
    Wei Ren
    The film "The Hermit" depicts the ideological transformation of Professor Miras, a famous scientist from Estonia. This renowned scholar was greatly disappointed because his carefully crafted plan to "transform the country's swamps into fertile land" was not adopted by the bourgeois government. During World War II, he secluded himself, rarely went out, and avoided discussing politics, treating his home as a "fortress" to isolate himself and his family from the outside world. However, man-made walls could not withstand the impact of the times. After the liberation of Estonia, the "hermit's" youngest son, Karl, finally broke out of the "fortress" to become a Red Army soldier, and his daughter and wife also left him. No one agreed with his "detached" attitude. Only his eldest son, Laif, who had just returned from abroad, and his nephew, Lygil, were most able to agree with and flatter him, making him feel that only this eldest son, who had studied in Germany, was truly a good assistant and conversationalist in his scientific research. In reality, he did not know that these two "refined" and "non-political" scholars were loyal lackeys of the fascist German bandits, traitors deliberately sent by the German bandits to hide in his residence and carry out anti-people activities. His "detached" attitude was being exploited by the enemy, objectively helping the enemy and causing immense harm to the people of the motherland.
    It was not until the day when the Estonian people warmly welcomed their liberators—the Soviet Red Army—marching west that the long-secluded old man, Professor Miras, finally stepped out of his "fortress" and came into contact with the world because he was seeing his daughter, Lydia, off on a train to study far away. On the way back, he saw his younger son, Karl, had become a Red Army cavalryman, braving the storm to march towards the lair of the fascist bandits. The old man was still lamenting, "The war has taken my son!" In that instant, explosions suddenly erupted in the public square. The bandits, jealous of the people's joyous celebration of victory, shamelessly destroyed countless lives and properties with explosives. This cruel crime of fascist assassins aroused the old hermit's indignation. He hurried back to his "fortress," and because the door was locked, he angrily broke it down with his shoulder. When Professor Miras, whose nerves were extremely tense, walked back to his study, the room was silent, and boundless emptiness greeted him. Later, he slowly walked into Laif's "study" and inadvertently discovered a large amount of US dollars, jewelry, and many gold teeth from dead people, and even explosive coal. At this moment, he suddenly realized that this "study" was the command center of all the evils he had seen. His "law-abiding" eldest son and nephew were the heads of the German concentration camps, traitors to the Estonian people. His "detachment" brought him not "peace," but more regret and sadness. When he could no longer bear it and decided to question his son and report to the government, he almost lost his life at the hands of his own son. Fortunately, the Soviet officer Kuslav arrived and rescued him.
    Through the education of these many vivid facts, the old man finally recognized his path, stepped out of the "fortress," and dedicated himself to the construction of the people's motherland. His great plan to "transform swamps into fertile land" was also realized under the people's regime.
    This fact tells us that the "detached" idea of scientists not asking about politics is wrong. Some people may think, like Professor Miras, that as long as they do not associate with imperialism, they will not become counter-revolutionaries and be exploited by imperialism. However, Professor Miras's experience should deeply alert people. Imperialism and reactionary bandits are ubiquitous. In this time of revolutionary upsurge, one of the places where counter-revolutionaries can best hide and do evil is this kind of secluded fortress. The reason why religions and secret societies are often exploited by imperialists and counter-revolutionaries is precisely because some people believe that religious belief is unrelated to politics, as a result, the enemy can better conceal themselves, just as Laif concealed himself in his father's "fortress." Counter-revolutionaries like the traitorous executioners Laif and Lygil are very difficult to distinguish because they are not only hidden in the "detached" "fortress," but also wear the guise of scholars and the mask of charitable doctors. Therefore, we should be very vigilant against such people and be careful not to become enemy air-raid shelters, harming the motherland and the people.

　　不要让敌人钻空子
    《世外老人》观后
    维仁
    《世外老人》这部影片是描写爱沙尼亚的一位著名科学家米拉斯教授的思想转变的。这位名学者，由于自己精心制作出来的“变祖国的沼泽为良田”的计划，没有被资产阶级的政府所采用而大失所望。在二次大战期间，他闭门读书，深居简出，绝口不问政治，把自己的家当作一个“堡垒”，使自己和家人都与外界隔绝起来。但是，人造的围墙，那里抵挡得了时代潮流的冲击呢？当爱沙尼亚解放后，这位“世外老人”的小儿子卡尔，终于冲出“堡垒”去当了红军战士，女儿及妻子也都离开了他。谁也不赞成他的“超然”世外的处世态度。只有他的新从外面回来的长子莱福及侄子李吉尔最能附合他，逢迎他，因此，使他感到只有这位在德国留学的大儿子，才真正是他科学研究工作中的好助手和谈话的对象。其实，他何尝知道：这两位既“清高”而又“不谈政治”的学者，正是法西斯德寇的忠实奴才，是德寇故意派来隐伏在他的宅院，进行反人民活动的叛徒。而他的“超然”的处世态度正为敌人所利用，使他在客观上帮助了敌人，予祖国人民以莫大的损害。
    直到爱沙尼亚人民在热烈欢送自己的解放者——苏联红军向西进军的那一天，这位长久幽居的老人米拉斯教授才因为送自己的女儿丽吉雅上火车到远方去学习，走出了他的“堡垒”，接触了人间世。归途中，他看到了小儿卡尔已成了红军骑兵战士，迎着暴风雨向法西斯匪徒的巢穴远征去了。这位老人尚在慨叹：“战争夺去了我的儿子！”就在那一刹那之间，群众广场上，突然爆炸声四起。匪徒们嫉恨这个人民胜利狂欢的日子，他们用炸药无耻地毁灭了无数人民的生命财产。这种法西斯暗害分子的残酷罪行，激起了这位世外老人的愤恨。他匆匆地赶回他的“堡垒”，由于房门紧闭，便愤激地用肩撞破大门。当这位神经极度紧张的米拉斯教授，走回书房时，屋内一片静寂，无边的空虚迎接着他。后来他缓缓走进莱福的“研究室”，无意中发现了大批美钞、珠宝及许多死人的金牙，甚至有爆炸性的煤块。这时，他才恍然大悟，这间“书房”正是他所看到的一切罪恶的司令部。他的“安分守己”的大儿及侄子，正是德寇集中营的首脑人物，爱沙尼亚人民的叛徒。他的“超然”带给他的不是“安静”，而是更多的悔恨和伤感。在他忍无可忍决定去质问儿子，并要报告政府时，几乎把生命断送在他亲生儿子的手里。幸而苏联军官库斯拉甫赶到，才解救了他。
    经过这许多活生生的事实的教育，这位老人终于认清了自己的道路，走出了“堡垒”，献身于人民祖国的建设事业。他的“变沼泽为良田”的伟大计划，也在人民的政权下实现了。
    这样一个事实告诉我们：科学家不问政治的“超然”思想是错误的。有些人也许和米拉斯教授一样，主观上以为只要不和帝国主义来往，就不致于使自己成了反革命，受帝国主义所利用。可是，米拉斯教授的遭遇，应深深引起人们的警惕。帝国主义及反动匪帮是无孔不入的。在这革命高涨的时候，最能使反革命隐藏作恶的地方之一，就是这种世外堡垒。宗教、道会门之所以常为帝国主义者及反革命分子所利用，其原因也正是由于有些人认为宗教信仰与政治无关，结果敌人就更好借此隐蔽自己，正如莱福借他父亲的“堡垒”隐蔽自己一样，像叛徒刽子手莱福及李吉尔这样的反革命分子，十分难以分辨，因为他们不仅是隐蔽在“超然”的“堡垒”里，而且还穿着学者的外衣，戴着慈善家医生的面具，因此，对这样的人，我们应该十分警惕，当心不要做了敌人的防空洞，贻害祖国和人民。
