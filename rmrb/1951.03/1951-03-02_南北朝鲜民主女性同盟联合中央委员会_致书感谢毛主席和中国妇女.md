　　Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union
    Sends Letter of Thanks to Chairman Mao and Chinese Women
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union (now known as the Korean Democratic Women's Union) sent letters to Chairman Mao and Chinese women respectively, thanking the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Chinese women for their assistance and encouragement. The full text of the two letters is as follows:
            Letter to Chairman Mao Zedong
    Great Leader of the Chinese People, Dear Friend of the Korean People, Chairman Mao Zedong:
    Today, the Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union, convened in Pyongyang, which has been permanently liberated from enemy occupation thanks to the heroic battles of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, respectfully extends our highest regards and heartfelt gratitude to the great you.
    Our peaceful life was shattered one morning in June, by countless American bullets suddenly flying in through the fog. Many of our cities and homes were destroyed in flames, and beloved husbands and precious children also lost their lives in the flames.
    Korean women, turning their hatred and determination for revenge against the barbarity of the American imperialist bandits on our motherland into sharp bayonets, are dedicating themselves to the honor of the motherland in assault groups and guerrilla units in the fighting ranks.
    Today, the North and South Korean women are gathered here, also symbolizing the will of every woman, that is, to oppose the devilish atrocities of American imperialism that attempts to turn the Korean people and Korean women into their slaves by occupying our motherland, to unite all women around the alliance, and to concentrate all our strength to absolutely guarantee the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War.
    Under your guidance, the Chinese people, cultivated and tempered, have extended a brotherly helping hand to us, making our strong will and determination, which only the victor possesses, even stronger. We are exerting the greatest patriotic enthusiasm, accompanying the offensive of the brave warriors, supporting the front lines, transporting ammunition, and strengthening production in the rear.
    In the capacity of the mothers of this nation, we assure you: We resolutely support the precious People's Army and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, especially those volunteers who were gloriously wounded in the war to resist America and defend the country. We will wholeheartedly treat and care for them, so that they can return to their own ranks.
    Victory belongs to us!
    We will further consolidate the unbreakable friendship between the peace-loving women of the world, headed by the great Soviet women, and the Chinese women.
    Finally, for the lasting freedom and happiness of Asian women, we wish you boundless longevity!
                              Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union
                                          January 20, 1951, in Korea
            Letter to the Chinese Women
    Dear friends from our warm neighbor, who intimately care for the suffering of Korean mothers, share our sorrow and joy:
    After the great Soviet army liberated our motherland, the Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union, which all Korean women have been hoping for for five years, has been convened. We, on behalf of all the women of Korea, extend our warm gratitude and congratulations to all the women of the People's Republic of China.
    Chinese women and mothers, who have become even closer to us in the struggle against the common enemy of the people of China and Korea—the American imperialist aggressors! The war launched by American imperialism in Korea, arrogantly following the vicious aggressive steps of invading Korea today, annexing China tomorrow, and then further ruling all of Asia, has brought unprecedented misfortune and disaster to the Korean people and mothers. American cannibal beasts and the traitor Syngman Rhee barbarously destroyed the achievements of the democratic reforms that the Korean people had earned with noble labor and sweat after liberation; they murdered countless sons and daughters of Korean mothers, carrying out bestial atrocities rarely seen in past wars. They did not leave us with anything.
    Countless corpses of our brothers and sisters scattered in the ruins and on the roadsides, which one of them is not related to Korean women, Korean mothers?
    The American imperialist bandits vainly hoped that we would wait in the harsh cold and desolate ruins, exhausted by hunger and hardship, and succumb due to loss of courage. Although cold and hunger caused some of our unfortunate compatriots to die cursing the enemy; but none of us succumbed because of this.
    Today, Korean women in the People's Army or in the People's Guerrilla, will bravely fight, taking the heroic spirit of selfless sacrifice, tenacity, and bravery that the Soviet women and you have displayed for the motherland and the people, as an example.
    In particular, the relationship between Korea and China is as close as lips and teeth, with houses adjacent to each other. Your sons and daughters and husbands, who resolutely rose up to oppose our common enemy, are today holding hands tightly with our husbands and sons, beginning a fierce offensive, and magnificent victories are reported to every mother every day on every battlefield. This has already determined the inevitability of the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War.
    We have Premier of the Cabinet of the Republic, Supreme Commander of the People's Army—General Kim Il-sung, who guides us towards victory and happiness; we have the support of Chinese women and women all over the world, led by the Soviet Union, our strength is endless. Without a doubt, we will be the victors.
    Dear friends! At this solemn meeting of the historically significant Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union, convened to further consolidate the seething strength of Korean women hating the enemy, we once again vow to you: Bearing in mind the various aids you have given us in the struggle for the liberation of the motherland, for the happiness of beloved parents, brothers, husbands, and children, we will strive to further consolidate the flesh-and-blood, sisterly friendship between Korean and Chinese women.
    For the freedom and happiness of women and the future of future generations, in order to continue to strengthen support for the front and consolidate the rear, we will comprehensively mobilize the women's alliance organizations and women, launch a tenacious and indomitable struggle, and vow to win the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War. We believe that you will continue to support and help us.
                            Joint Central Committee of the North and South Korean Democratic Women's Union
                                          January 20, 1951

　　南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会
    致书感谢毛主席和中国妇女
    【新华社讯】南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会（现在名称为朝鲜民主妇女同盟）分别致书毛主席和中国妇女，感谢中国人民志愿军和中国妇女所给予的帮助与鼓励。两信全文如下：
            致毛泽东主席的信中国人民伟大的领袖，朝鲜人民亲近的朋友毛泽东主席：
    今天，由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的英勇战斗，而从敌人暂时强占之下永远解放了的平壤，召开的南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会，谨向伟大的您致以崇高的敬礼和深切的感谢。
    我们的和平生活，被六月的一个清晨，在大雾里突然飞来的无数的美国子弹给打破了。我们的许多城市和住宅在火焰中毁灭了，亲爱的丈夫和宝贵的孩子也在火焰里丧失了他们的身躯。
    朝鲜妇女，把对于美帝国主义强盗对我祖国兽行的憎恶，和复仇的决心，用在尖锐的枪尖上，正在战斗队伍中的突击组和游击队里为祖国的荣誉献出了自己。
    今天，南北朝鲜妇女在这里集会，也是象征着每个妇女的意志，即反对妄图变朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女为自己的奴隶而强占我祖国的美帝国主义的魔鬼般的暴行，团结全体妇女于同盟的周围，并集中全部力量绝对保障祖国解放战争的最后胜利。
    在您的指导下培养和锻炼出来的中国人民，向我们伸出了兄弟的援助之手，使我们这种只有胜利者才拥有的坚强意志和决心更为坚固。我们正发挥最大的爱国热情，伴随着勇士们的进攻，支援前线，输送弹药和加强后方生产。
    我们以这国家的母亲的身份谨向您保证：我们坚决支持宝贵的人民军队和英勇的中国人民志愿部队，特别是对于为了援朝卫国光荣负伤的志愿军。我们一定热心地治疗和看护他们，使他们能回到自己的队伍里去。
    胜利是属于我们的！
    我们要进一步巩固以伟大的苏联妇女为首的全世界爱好和平的妇女和中国妇女之间永远不灭的友谊。
    最后，为了亚洲妇女永久的自由幸福，祝你万寿无疆！
                              南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会
                                          一九五一年一月二十日于朝鲜
            给中国妇女们的信亲切地关怀着朝鲜母亲们的痛苦，和我们一同悲愤，一同喜悦的热情的邻国朋友们：
    在伟大的苏联军队解放了我们祖国之后，五年来全体朝鲜妇女所共同希望着的南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会已召开了。我们代表全朝鲜的妇女向中华人民共和国的全体妇女致以热烈的感谢和祝贺。
    在反对中朝两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者的斗争中，和我们更加亲密起来的中国妇女和母亲们！美帝国主义狂妄的按照今天侵略朝鲜，明天吞并中国，再进一步统治全亚洲的凶恶的侵略步骤，在朝鲜发动的战争给朝鲜人民和母亲们带来了史无前例的不幸和灾难。美国吃人野兽和李承晚叛徒们，野蛮地破坏了解放后朝鲜人民用高贵的劳动血汗换来的民主改革的成果；杀害了朝鲜母亲们的无数儿女，进行着历代战争中所稀有的野兽暴行。他们没有给我们留下任何一点东西。
    散弃在废墟中和路旁的我们兄弟姊妹们的无数尸体，他们那一个不是同朝鲜妇女，朝鲜母亲关联着的人呢？
    美帝国主义强盗妄想等待我们在严寒和荒凉的废墟上，因饥饿和困难而疲惫，因丧失勇气而屈服。虽然寒冷和饥饿使我们中间不幸的一部分同胞诅咒着敌人死去了；但是我们中间却没有一个人因此屈服。
    今天，朝鲜妇女在人民军队里或在人民游击队里，都将以苏联妇女和你们为了祖国和人民所发挥的不惜牺牲的英雄精神、坚韧性和勇敢性，当作榜样而勇敢地战斗着。
    特别是朝中之间的关系，有如唇齿相依，堂户相连。为了反对我们的共同敌人毅然奋起的您们的儿女和丈夫，今天与我们的丈夫和儿女紧拉着手，开始猛烈的进攻，在各个战场上每天都有辉煌的胜利快报传给我们每个母亲。这就已经决定了祖国解放战争的最后胜利的必然性。
    我们有引导我们走向胜利和幸福的共和国内阁首相、人民军最高司令官——金日成将军；有以苏联为首的中国妇女和全世界妇女的声援，我们的力量是无穷无尽的。毫无疑问，战胜者一定是我们。
    亲爱的朋友们！在为了更加巩固朝鲜妇女憎恶仇敌的热血沸腾的力量而召开的具有历史意义的南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会这一严肃的会议上，向你们再一次的宣誓：牢记在为了祖国的解放，为了亲爱父母、兄弟、丈夫、儿女的幸福的斗争中，你们给与我们的各种援助，为更加巩固朝中妇女血肉相连的、姊妹的友好关系而努力。
    为了妇女的自由幸福和后代的将来，为了继续加强支援前线和巩固后方，我们将全面发动女性同盟组织和妇女们，展开顽强的、百折不挠的斗争，誓必争取祖国解放战争的最后胜利。相信您们将会继续不断地声援与帮助我们。
                            南北朝鲜民主女性同盟联合中央委员会
                                          一九五一年一月二十日
