　　A Group Achieving Success in Researching and Applying "Tissue Therapy"
　　　　Wang Ping
　　Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published the article "Tissue Therapy" on February 11th, it aroused widespread attention from people in the domestic medical and health fields. On February 27th, the Northeast Daily introduced the situation of research and application of tissue therapy at China Medical University in Shenyang, which is now reprinted as follows:
　　The editor's note in the People's Daily when publishing the article "Tissue Therapy" pointed out that a small number of people in China's medical field have conducted research and application of tissue therapy. Among this "small number of people," six are from China Medical University in Shenyang. Since September 1950, under the leadership of the university, they have begun to research and apply tissue therapy and have achieved significant results.
　　These six people are:
　　Doctors – Wang Sufu, Wang Jianmin, Zhou Bochi, Liu Yongji.
　　Nurses – Yang Wenxiu, Wang Zhenpin.
　　They collected as many Soviet articles and books related to tissue therapy as possible, and tried their best to understand from a political perspective how tissue therapy originated in the Soviet Union and not in the United States, as well as the positive significance of tissue therapy for biology and the broad masses of people. They realized that this great invention of tissue therapy could only originate in the socialist Soviet Union and could never originate in the corrupt capitalist system of the United States, because the American social system needs to make money instead of seeking welfare for mankind. The medicines they invented, such as "Streptomycin," can only passively treat diseases and are not necessarily reliable, but the price is shockingly expensive, which is very beneficial to capitalists; while the great invention of tissue therapy, in line with scientific principles, is simple and easy to implement. Animals, plants, and corpses can all produce "biogenic stimulators," the effect of which can not only passively treat diseases, but also actively enhance the health of the human body and improve the human body's resistance to external harsh conditions (climate, bacteria...), thereby achieving preventive effects.
　　Dr. Wang Sufu and his colleagues realized this, thereby consolidating their interest in research and confidence in success. They often said: If tissue therapy is successfully researched and applied, it can first save the country a huge expenditure on tonics and precious medicines; veteran cadres who have lost their health and contracted various chronic diseases during the long revolutionary struggle can gradually recover their health simply by "burying" or "injecting" biogenic stimulators (tissue therapy is particularly effective for various chronic diseases), not to mention the benefits to the people.
　　They manufactured biogenic stimulators according to the methods introduced by the Soviet Union. In order to test whether the manufactured biogenic stimulators were effective and whether there were any side effects, the six of them first experimented on their own bodies, and then on their relatives. People who were tested—whether "buried" or "injected"—had the following characteristics: their weight increased; the amount of stool decreased (a sign of enhanced absorption); they were full of energy at work; and they had fewer colds or no colds at all (the Northeast winter is most prone to colds). No one experienced any side effects.
　　In this way, they gradually applied it clinically, treating nearly one hundred people (most only "buried" once. According to Soviet experience, the effect is significant only after three or more times). Here are a few examples with significant effects:
　　Huang Youwu, 27 years old, male, intractable headache, thin, weighed 56.5 kg before surgery. Three grams of buried chicken spleen (the thing that produces biogenic stimulators, same below). Seven days later, his mind gradually cleared, the headache disappeared, and his overall nutritional status changed significantly. His weight increased by two kilograms in three weeks, and he has now returned to work.
　　Jin Boqun, 28 years old, male, thin, weighed 56 kg. Three grams of buried dog spleen. One week after the surgery, his weight increased by two kilograms, his eyes were bright, his sleep was sufficient, his appetite was strong, his nutritional status improved, and he never caught a cold.
　　Li Jinshan, 40 years old, male, carbuncle on the neck, untreated for more than a month. Five grams of buried chicken gizzard fat. The carbuncle "necrosed" (meaning local death), all the tissue fell off, fresh granulation grew, and it healed in two weeks.
　　Li Guimin, deputy section chief of the medical university's secretariat, suffered from gastric ulcer. Hearing that tissue therapy was very effective, he requested a trial. After 20 injections (20 days), the gastric ulcer healed, and his weight increased from 120 jin to 137 jin, that is, an increase of 17 jin in 20 days.
　　The therapeutic efficacy of tissue therapy has been affirmed from their research and application. Now they are further studying the application of tissue therapy to prevention. This motivation is inspired by strong patriotism. When they learned in January this year that Chinese People's Volunteers were freezing to death and being injured by frostbite on the harsh Korean battlefield; when they realized and accepted the idea that "prevention first" is the way to strengthen the country and the body in their medical activities; when the leadership called on them to appropriately shift the focus of their research—they began to study the application of tissue therapy to prevention.
　　They searched through all the Soviet books on tissue therapy they could find and found no materials in this regard. They decided to experiment on site. They thought: People who are buried or injected with biogenic stimulators have reduced or eliminated colds, which proves that they can prevent colds; if colds can be prevented, frostbite may also be preventable. Therefore, on the one hand, they still used themselves as experimental subjects. After burying or injecting biogenic stimulators, they walked in the cold wind bareheaded to test their frost resistance. Experience proved that they were indeed less afraid of the cold than ordinary people; on the other hand, they experimented with the most cold-intolerant white mice. Two groups of white mice were placed in freezing ground at minus 15 degrees Celsius at the same time. The group injected with biogenic stimulators died on average after four hours and thirty-four minutes, while those not injected died on average after two hours and twelve minutes; one mouse that was injected five times actually survived for seven hours and fifty-seven minutes at minus 20 degrees Celsius before dying.
　　From this, it can be seen that it is possible to apply tissue therapy to prevention. They are continuing to research, and once its role in prevention is confirmed, it will undoubtedly add important content to tissue therapy.
　　A progressive and creative research attitude makes them dissatisfied with their existing achievements. They understand the principle that tissue therapy has opened up broad prospects for the biological and medical fields, and they want to study how to use biogenic stimulators to prevent some of the most prevalent and stubborn diseases in the Northeast, such as Keshan disease, chronic infectious diseases, etc., according to this principle. The formula is—to find some animals and plants that are most resistant to Keshan disease (or other diseases) and not affected by Keshan disease (or other diseases), and to take their tissues after they have been exposed to the environment to manufacture and produce biogenic stimulators, and then bury or inject this biogenic stimulator into the human body, which may achieve the purpose of prevention.
　　This research spirit should be supported and helped. The research results that have been achieved should be "carefully promoted as much as possible." (People's Daily Editor's Note)
　　However, some people have not paid enough attention to tissue therapy and the research on tissue therapy. Some even said incorrect things like "If you succeed in your research, doctors will have to lose their jobs." The People's Daily editor has powerfully pointed out: "This conservative phenomenon should not exist in our country today!" And there should be "the necessity to vigorously promote this scientific new invention."

　　一个研究和应用《组织疗法》获得成绩的小组
    王坪
    编者按：本报二月十一日发表《组织疗法》一文后，引起了国内医药卫生界人士的普遍注意。二月二十七日，东北日报介绍了沈阳中国医科大学研究和应用组织疗法的情形，现转载如下：
    人民日报在发表《组织疗法》一文时的编者按语中指出，我国医药界已经有少数人进行了组织疗法的研究和应用。在这“少数人”中，沈阳中国医科大学占去六个。他们自一九五○年九月起，在校方的领导下，着手研究和应用组织疗法并已有了显著成绩。
    他们六个人是：
    大夫——王素孚、王健民、周波池、刘永吉。
    护士——杨文秀、王振品。
    他们尽可能地搜集了苏联有关组织疗法的文章和书籍，并尽可能地从政治方面去认识组织疗法如何产生在苏联而不产生在美国，以及组织疗法对于生物学及广大人民群众的积极意义等问题。他们认识到：组织疗法这个伟大的发明只能产生在社会主义制度的苏联，决不可能产生在资本主义腐朽制度的美国，因为美国的社会制度需要的是赚钱而不是为人类谋福利，他们发明的“连霉素”之类的药品，只能消极地治病且不一定有把握，但价钱却贵得惊人，这对资本家却是非常有利的；而组织疗法这样伟大的发明，合乎科学原理，方法简便易行，动物、植物、尸体都可以制造出“生物原刺激素”，其功效不单可以消极的治病，还可以从积极方面增强人类身体的健康，提高人类肉体对外界恶劣条件（气候、病菌……）的抵抗力，因而能达到预防的功效。
    王素孚大夫他们认识到这一点，从而巩固了研究的兴趣和成功的信心。他们常说：组织疗法要是研究和应用成功了，首先可以替国家省却属于滋补品及宝贵药品的一笔巨大开支；在长期革命斗争中损失了健康、染上了各种慢性病的老干部，只需“埋藏”或“注射”生物原刺激素就可以逐渐恢复健康（组织疗法对各种慢性病特别有效），对于人民的造福那就不用说了。
    他们按照苏联介绍的方法，把生物原刺激素制造出来了。为了试验制造出来的生物原刺激素是否有效及是否有副作用，他们六人首先以自己的躯体作试验，再在自己的亲人中作试验。被试验的人——不论是“埋藏”或“注射”都有这样几个特征：体重增加了；大便的量减少了（吸收力增强的表现）；工作精力饱满了；感冒减少了或根本不感冒了（东北的冬天最容易感冒）。大家都没有任何副作用现象发生。
    这样，他们便逐步临床应用，做了近一百人（多数只“埋藏”一次。据苏联经验三次以上效果才显著）。这里有几个收效较著的例子：
    黄友伍，二十七岁，男，顽固性头痛，瘦弱，手术前体重五六·五公斤，埋藏鸡脾（即产生出生物原刺激素的东西。下同）三克，七天后，头脑逐渐清新，头痛消失，全身营养状况显著改变，体重在三周后增加二公斤，现已恢复工作。
    金伯群，二十八岁，男，瘦弱，体重五十六公斤，埋藏狗脾三克，手术后一周增加体重二公斤，眼发光亮，睡眠充足，食欲旺盛，营养状态改善，从未感冒。
    李金山，四十岁，男，项部痈，近月余未治，埋藏鸡肌肾脂肪五克，痈“坏死”（局部死亡的意思），组织全部脱落，新鲜肉芽生出，两周痊愈。
    医大秘书科副科长李桂民患胃溃疡，听说组织疗法很有效，请求试验，注射二十次（二十天），胃溃疡痊愈，体重由一百二十斤增加为一百三十七斤，就是说，在二十天内增加了十七斤。
    组织疗法在治疗上的功效已经从他们的研究与应用中肯定下来了。现在他们在更进一步研究把组织疗法应用到预防方面。这一动机是激发于强烈的爱国主义。当他们今年一月知道中国人民志愿军在酷寒的朝鲜战场上有冻死冻伤的；当他们在医务活动中体会和接受了“预防为主”才是强国强身之道的思想；当领导上号召他们把研究重点适当转移的时候——他们便着手研究把组织疗法运用到预防上。
    他们找遍了所能找到的苏联关于组织疗法的书籍，没有看到有这方面的材料。他们决定实地试验。他们想：埋藏或注射生物原刺激素的人减少或消灭了感冒，这就证明可以预防感冒；感冒可以预防，冷冻未必不能预防。因此，他们一方面仍然以自己为试验，埋藏或注射了生物原刺激素后，光着头在寒风里走，试试抗冻性能怎样，经验证明，确比平常人不怕冷；另一方面，他们以最不耐冻的小白鼠来试验，把两组小白鼠同时放在零下十五度的冻地，注射了生物原刺激素的一组平均四时三十四分才死亡，未经注射者平均二时十二分便死亡了；其中有一只注射的次数达五次，它竟在零下二十度经过七时五十七分以后才死亡。
    由此可见，把组织疗法运用到预防上是可能的。他们正继续研究，一旦肯定了它在预防中的作用，毫无疑问是给组织疗法增添了重要的内容。
    带着进取性和创造性的研究态度使他们不满足于既得的成绩。他们理解到组织疗法给生物界和医药界开辟了广阔前途的原理，他们要根据这原理去研究如何用生物原刺激素去预防东北最流行的和顽固的一些疾病如克山病，慢性传染病等。其公式是——找出某种最能抵抗克山病（或其他病），不受克山病（或其他病）侵害的动物和植物，把它们给与环境的作用而将其机体组织拿来制造产生出生物原刺激素，再用这种生物原刺激素去埋藏或注射在人的肌体内，那就可能达到预防目的。
    这种研究精神是应该得到支持和帮助的。已经研究出来的成果，应该“认真地加以尽可能的推广。”（人民日报编者按语）
    但也有某些人对组织疗法及对组织疗法的研究并没有引起足够的重视，有的还说什么“你们研究成功，医生只好失业”之类不正确的话。人民日报编者曾有力地指出：“这种保守的现象在今天的我国不应该存在！”并且应该“有尽力提倡这种科学的新发明的必要。”
