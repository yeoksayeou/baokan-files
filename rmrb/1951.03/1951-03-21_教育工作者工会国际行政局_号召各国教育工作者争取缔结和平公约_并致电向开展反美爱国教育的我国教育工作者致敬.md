(1) Letter from the International Administrative Bureau of the Education Workers' Union to Education Workers of All Countries Regarding Striving for the Conclusion of a Peace Pact
To teachers, professors, and scientific workers worldwide:

The American imperialists, stained with the blood of Korean women, the elderly, and children, are attempting to expand the flames of war to the entire world, plunging humanity into a new world war.

You must already feel the tragic consequences of the rearmament race, the renewed undermining of fundamental rights, and the heavy burden placed on you by the renewed cuts in public education and health budgets.

War brings unprecedented poverty.

The work of striving for peace is the work of all good people around the world, regardless of their party, profession, religion, or skin color.

We agree with the declarations and resolutions of the Peace Council: demanding that the five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—sign a peace pact; sending a delegation to the United Nations to request discussion of the Peace Council's declaration and all resolutions related to defending peace.

We must actively promote the Peace Council's declaration on the signing of a peace pact by the five powers, sign the declaration, and promote and explain this declaration and all resolutions of the Peace Council to parents, citizens, and students.

Let us form a strong united front against the common enemy of mankind—the instigators of a new war.

We demand reductions in military spending and armaments, and increases in budgets to meet the living needs of the working people and in budgets for people's education.

We must condemn attempts by certain countries to use schools to serve preparations for a new war. Oppose the establishment of militaristic youth organizations in schools, and oppose educating children with a spirit of hatred of humanity, racial discrimination, and militarism.

All democratic forces must strongly protest the use of radio, literature, film, and all other mass propaganda tools to train young people for war. We must educate children with mutual love and friendship among all nations, making them true warriors for peace!

(2) Telegram of Respect from the International Administrative Bureau of the Education Workers' Union to Chinese Education Workers Regarding Carrying Out the Patriotic Education Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea
Dear Comrades:

The International Administrative Bureau of the Education Workers' Union listened with particular excitement to Comrade Fang Ming's description at the meeting held in Sofia at the end of February of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people to defend peace and oppose American imperialism. We learned that on December 14, 1950, three thousand professors from various universities in Shanghai organized a demonstration against American imperialism, unprecedented in China. They shouted the slogans "Support the Korean People's Army, support the Chinese People's Volunteers," "Resolutely oppose American aggression, defend the security of the motherland, and defend world peace."

At the same time, we are particularly pleased that in your demonstration ranks, there are not only presidents and professors, but also dozens of comrades who are over sixty or seventy years old. We are especially moved by the high degree of patriotism shown by some comrades who participated in the march despite being ill.

Sixty professors and assistant teachers personally took the lead in encouraging their children and students to devote themselves to the great work of national defense construction, and also initiated a campaign to donate airplanes. This example is worthy of learning. The propaganda movement launched by 30,000 teachers and students in Beijing is indeed a powerful method of opposing the enemy's attempts to deceive the Chinese people. The fighting slogans of Professor Hua Luogeng, "Today is not the time to talk, it is the time to act. The enemy's bayonet is pointing at our chest. We must drive away our enemy," not only inspired the Chinese youth who are fighting against imperialism, but also have the same significance for the democratic and progressive youth around the world who hold firm confidence in winning the victory of defending peace and opposing new war-mongers.

The struggle of Chinese professors and teachers to win the political, economic, and cultural development of the motherland and to oppose American aggression is a major contribution to consolidating world peace and exposing and thwarting the aggressive plans of the American and British war-mongers.

Your own example of high patriotism, as well as your scientific and educational activities, for educating Chinese youth to love the people, love the motherland, establish true patriotism, and use all their strength to build a democratic New China, defend the fruits of victory, and defend the freedom and independence of the People's Republic of China, so that it will no longer be attacked by imperialism, is indeed the best method.

Dear Comrades: The Administrative Bureau extends warm greetings to you for your success in the struggle for peace. Your success is also our success, because peace is indivisible, and defending peace is the common cause of progressive people all over the world.

We wholeheartedly wish you new victories in the struggle against American imperialist aggression, completely and thoroughly crushing the war plans of American imperialism and its subservient tools.

    教育工作者工会国际行政局
    号召各国教育工作者争取缔结和平公约
    并致电向开展反美爱国教育的我国教育工作者致敬
    【新华社二十日讯】中国教育工作者工会最近收到教育工作者工会国际行政局关于为争取缔结和平公约告各国教育工作者书和关于开展抗美援朝的爱国主义教育运动向中国教育工作者的致敬电。在上述文件中署名的计有：教育工作者工会国际行政局主席瓦隆（法国），总书记德拉努（法国），副主席格里夫科夫（苏联），委员：斯·加诺夫斯基（保加利亚），依·阿保尔尚（罗马尼亚），达皮也罗（意大利），波科拉（波兰），克·爱耳勃利歇（德意志民主共和国），斯德克兰恩（捷克），克拉依歇耳（奥地利）。这两项文件全文如下：
   （一）教育工作者工会国际行政局为争取缔结和平公约告各国教育工作者书全世界的教员、教授、科学工作者：
    染满了朝鲜妇女、老人、儿童鲜血的美国帝国主义者正在企图把战争的火焰扩张到全世界，把人类投入新的世界大战。
    你们一定已经感到重整军备竞赛的悲惨的后果，感到基本权利重新遭受摧残，感到公共教育、卫生预算的再度削减所加给你们的重负。
    战争带来了空前无比的贫困。
    争取和平的工作是全世界一切善良人民的工作，不论他们所属的党派、职业或宗教，也不论他们的肤色。
    我们同意和平理事会的宣言和决议：要求五大强国——美、苏、中、英、法——签订和平公约；派遣代表团前往联合国要求讨论和平理事会的宣言及一切有关保卫和平的决议。
    我们要积极宣传和平理事会关于五强签订和平公约的宣言，在宣言上签名，向家长、市民和学生宣传解释和平理事会这一宣言和一切决议。
    让我们结成一条坚强的统一战线，反对人类的公敌——新战争挑拨者。
    我们要求缩减军费、裁减军备，要求增加满足劳动人民生活需要的预算，增加人民教育的预算。
    我们要谴责某些国家使学校为准备新的战争服务的企图。反对在学校内成立军国主义性的青年组织，反对以仇视人类、种族歧视及军国主义的精神来教育儿童。
    一切民主力量要严重抗议利用无线电、文学、电影以及一切其他群众宣传工具来训练青年准备战争。我们要以各民族相互热爱和友谊来教育儿童，使他们成为真正的和平战士！
   （二）教育工作者工会国际行政局关于开展抗美援朝的爱国主义
        教育运动向中国教育工作者的致敬电亲爱的同志们：
    教育工作者工会国际行政局，以特别兴奋的情绪，听取了方明同志于二月底在索菲亚召开的会议上，叙述关于中国人民保卫和平反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争的经过。我们知道了在一九五○年十二月十四日，上海各大学的三千位教授组织了中国以前从未见过的反对美帝国主义的示威游行。他们喊出了“支援朝鲜人民军，支援中国志愿军”，“坚决反对美帝侵略，保卫祖国安全，保卫世界和平”的口号。
    同时我们特别感到高兴的是，在你们的示威队伍中，不仅有校长和教授，并且还有几十位年逾六、七十岁的同志。尤其使我们感动的是有几位同志抱病游行所表示的高度爱国主义。
    六十位教授及助教亲自带头鼓励自己的子女及学生投入祖国国防建设的伟大工作，并且还发起了捐献飞机的运动，这种范例是值得学习的。北京三万教员及学生所展开的宣传运动，在反对敌人企图欺骗中国人民的阴谋上，的确是一种有力的方法。“今天已经不是说话的时候了，应该是行动的时候了，敌人的刺刀已指向我们的胸膛，我们当赶走我们的敌人。”华罗庚教授这几句战斗的口号，不仅鼓舞了正在向帝国主义作斗争的中国青年，而且对于争取保卫和平、反对新世界战争贩子的胜利持有坚决信心的全世界民主进步青年也有同样的意义。
    中国教授及教员们争取祖国政治、经济和文化的发展及反对美国侵略的斗争，对于巩固世界和平，暴露并挫败美英战争贩子的侵略计划是一个重大贡献。
    你们自己的高度的爱国主义的榜样，以及你们的科学与教育活动，对于教育中国青年，使其热爱人民，热爱祖国，确立真正的爱国主义，用他们一切力量，建设民主新中国，保卫胜利果实，保卫中华人民共和国的自由与独立，使之不再受帝国主义的攻击，确实是一种最好的方法。
    亲爱的同志们：行政局对你们在和平斗争上所获得的成功，敬致热情的敬礼。你们的成功也就是我们的成功，因为和平是不可分的，保卫和平是全世界进步人士的共同事业。
    我们衷心地祝你们在反对美国帝国主义侵略的斗争中，取得新的胜利，完全地彻底地粉碎美帝国主义及其顺从工具的战争计划。
