Xinhua News Agency, March 17th – The American aggressors are deeply perplexed and uneasy about the proactive and temporary withdrawal of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies from Seoul. Their already low confidence has not been strengthened by this. Reuters correspondent Bacheler, who is with the US Eighth Army headquarters in Korea, admitted that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "completed an orderly retreat plan" before withdrawing from Seoul, and the advancing US troops encountered only "empty foxholes and trenches." Even under these circumstances, the American invading forces, which had repeatedly suffered heavy blows, had to proceed "slowly" under the cover of armored units, with trepidation. According to UPI correspondent Carichel at the US Eighth Army headquarters, "American military commanders" are "now trying to find an explanation" for the "enigma of the mysterious withdrawal" of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies.

Even MacArthur, the head of the US invading forces in Korea, dared not express optimism after the American invading forces entered the empty city of Seoul. In his reply to the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, he admitted that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies had "retreated in an orderly manner." He said in a bewildered tone, "From a military point of view, the fall of Seoul is merely an accidental event in the war. The future of Seoul cannot be considered secure." Therefore, MacArthur warned Syngman Rhee, "I don't think it is wise to move your government back to Seoul immediately."

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 16th – An anti-aircraft unit and a ground artillery unit of the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Seoul front, inflicted heavy blows on the air force and ground forces of the American invading forces advancing on Seoul.

On the morning of March 3rd, enemy artillery on the south bank of the Han River first bombarded Seoul wildly with heavy artillery. At 9:00 a.m., more than 20 enemy jet, Mustang fighters, and light bombers came to Seoul and strafed and bombed indiscriminately. An anti-aircraft unit of the Korean People's Army bravely fought against the enemy planes. Hundreds and thousands of shells and bullets fired from the ground into the sky formed a tight net of fire, closely chasing the aerial bandits. The warriors of the fourth company of a certain high-射炮 unit excitedly said, "We have only seen our brother units perform meritorious deeds in the past few days. Today, it's our turn!" Zhu Kong-su, a shooter in the second platoon of the second squad, set a record by hitting a jet fighter. The plane immediately crashed on the south bank of the Han River. The first good news quickly spread throughout the units. In order to compete with the anti-aircraft units, the ground artillery units also bombarded the American bandits moving back and forth on the opposite bank of the Han River, killing more than 20 people at once, and then destroyed two enemy artillery positions. At this time, the observer reported, "The enemy has dispatched 20 trucks and several tanks from the Incheon direction and has entered the Gaehwasan area of Yeongdeungpo." The artillerymen said happily, "Let it bloom in Gaehwasan!" The shells whistled towards the enemy, and a burst of fire rose with a loud noise. Two enemy tanks and six vehicles were destroyed.

While the artillerymen were laughing, good news of shooting down enemy planes came again. Che Yun-can, an anti-tank machine gunner of a certain unit of the People's Army, aimed his anti-tank gun at a Mustang fighter circling over his position and fired three bullets. The "Mustang" immediately turned into a "fire horse" and crashed on the south bank. A burst of cheers rang out on the position: "Learn from Che Yun-can!"

The first batch of enemy planes had been beaten and fled in all directions, when suddenly more than 20 enemy planes flew in again. Li Zhen-yu, the leader of the "anti-aircraft shooting team" of the second battalion of a certain unit of the People's Army, quickly organized all the heavy machine guns, light machine guns, anti-tank guns, and rifles of his team and launched an air-land battle with the enemy planes. A "Mustang" enemy plane was shot down, and the remaining enemy planes dared not circle over this position again. However, the shooters refused to give up their prey. They moved to another position and shot down another "Mustang" plane.

While the anti-aircraft shooters were constantly shooting down enemy planes, the artillery units also stepped up their hunting of land targets. A train of enemies coming out of Yeongdeungpo had two carriages destroyed by the artillerymen. Four vehicles of the enemy at Gimpo Airport were also destroyed. By 8:00 p.m., the artillery units of this unit of the People's Army had destroyed four enemy tanks, two train carriages, and 23 vehicles, and the anti-aircraft shooting units had shot down nine enemy planes, while the unit itself had no casualties.

　　美军对中朝人民军队主动转移深感惶惑
    朝人民军防空部队炮兵部队曾重创进犯汉城美军
    【新华社十七日讯】美国侵略者对于朝中人民军队主动地暂时撤离汉城，深感惶惑不安，其低落的信心并未因此稍见加强。路透社随侵朝美军第八军总部记者巴契勒承认：朝、中人民部队在撤离汉城之前，“曾完成了井然有序的撤退计划”，进犯的美军所遇到的尽是“空无一人的单人壕和堑壕”。即使在这种情况下，曾经一再遭受到惨重打击的美国侵略军，仍不得不提心吊胆地在装甲部队掩护下，“缓缓前进”。据合众社驻美军第八军总部记者卡里歇尔透露：“美国军事指挥官们”对朝、中人民部队“神秘撤退的哑谜”，“现在正试图找寻解释”。
    美国侵略军进入汉城空城后，甚至侵朝美军首脑麦克阿瑟也不敢表示乐观。他在给朝鲜的卖国贼李承晚的复信中承认：朝、中人民部队是“井然有序地撤退的”。他惶然地说：“汉城的易手，由军事观点上看来，不过是战事中的一个偶然事件。汉城的前途，尚不能认为是稳固的。”因此，麦克阿瑟对李承晚提出警告说：“我认为：立即将你的政府迁回汉城，并非明智之举。”
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】在汉城前线和我国人民志愿军并肩作战的朝鲜人民军某部防空部队和地面炮兵部队，曾给予向汉城进犯的美国侵略军的空军与地面部队以惨重打击。
    三月三日早晨，汉江南岸敌人炮兵先以重炮向汉城疯狂轰击。上午九点钟，又来敌喷气式、野马式战斗机及轻轰炸机二十多架，对汉城狂射滥炸。朝鲜人民军某部防空部队便英勇地和敌机展开了搏斗。从地面射向天空的千百颗炮弹和子弹，构成了严密的火网，紧追着空中强盗们。某部高射炮第四连的勇士们兴奋地说：“前几天只见兄弟部队立功，今天要看我们的了。”第二排第二班射手朱空洙首创纪录，将一架喷气式机击中。该机立即坠落在汉江南岸。这首次的捷报马上传遍了各个部队。地面炮兵部队为了和防空部队竞赛，也对汉江对岸来往蠢动的美国强盗进行轰击，一下就打死了二十多人，接着又摧毁了敌人两个炮兵阵地。这时观察员报告说：“敌人从仁川方向开来了二十辆卡车和几辆坦克，已进入永登浦开花山地区。”炮手们高兴地说：“就让它在开花山开花吧！”炮弹呼啸着向敌人飞去，随着巨响飞起一片火光。敌人的两辆坦克和六辆汽车被击毁了。
    炮兵们正在欢笑，忽然又传来打落飞机的捷报。人民军某部反坦克机枪手车允参，用他的反坦克枪瞄准一架在他阵地上空盘旋的野马式战斗机，打了三发子弹，这架“野马”就随即变成了“火马”，坠落到南岸去了。阵地上响起了一片欢呼声：“向车允参学习！”
    第一批敌机已经被打得东逃西窜，忽然又飞来了二十多架敌机。人民军某部第二营“对空射击组”组长李真玉，迅速地把本组的重机枪轻机枪反坦克枪和步枪全部组织起来，和敌机展开了陆空大战。一架“野马”式敌机被打下去了，其余的敌机再不敢在这一阵地上空盘旋。射击手们却不肯放弃他们的猎物，他们转移到另一个阵地去，又打下了一架“野马”式机。
    与对空射击手不断击落敌机同时，炮兵部队也加紧猎取陆上的猎物。从永登浦开出来的一列敌人的火车，被炮兵们击毁了两节车厢。金浦机场敌人的四辆汽车也被击毁了。到下午八时止，该部人民军的炮兵部队已击毁敌军坦克四辆，火车车厢两节，汽车二十三辆，对空射击部队击落敌机九架，而该部自己却无一伤亡。
