Xinhua News Agency, March 19th:

　　The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the First National Conference on Secondary Education on March 19th. The central tasks of this conference are to resolve: (1) the direction and tasks of secondary education; (2) the nature, tasks, curriculum, teaching materials, and public-private relationship of ordinary middle schools; and (3) student health issues.

　　Minister of Education Ma Xulun said in his opening speech that secondary education is an important link in our national education construction. Our country's national defense construction, economic construction, cultural construction, and other tasks urgently need a large number of intermediate technical personnel, primary school teachers, and general cadres with an intermediate level of education. This must rely on secondary education to cultivate and supply. At the same time, the country's senior construction talents also need to be cultivated through secondary education first. He also pointed out that due to the country's current financial difficulties and the limitations of objective conditions such as manpower and material resources, we should focus on the work of adjustment and consolidation for general secondary schools, to prepare conditions for future development. The government adopts a policy of actively supporting and strengthening the leadership of private secondary schools, and encourages private donations to establish schools. He also emphasized that school education in various regions must implement the spirit of "health first." This conference should study some specific methods, make decisions, and solve the problem of students' health.

　　Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, spoke at the meeting. He first pointed out that secondary education has made great progress in the past year. However, the current state of secondary education in the country is still far from meeting the actual needs of the people and the needs of national construction. On the other hand, we cannot yet increase the number of schools and accommodate a large number of students. Therefore, we should focus on improving quality to remedy this problem. We must run secondary schools better under the existing conditions and cultivate more outstanding talents for the country. Vice Premier Guo also pointed out that the period when young students receive secondary education is a very important stage in their lives. This has a profound impact on the future of young people. We must cultivate young people in secondary schools so that they have rich knowledge and skills, noble morals and sentiments, and healthy physiques.

　　Xu Teli, a member of the Central People's Government, also spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that drafting curriculum standards is not an easy task and must be done with caution. First, we must formulate curriculum standards suitable for our own needs based on the principles of the Soviet secondary school curriculum standards and in combination with our country's actual situation. He suggested that the representatives attending the meeting fully exchange experiences and conduct thorough research so that the meeting can solve this problem in a pragmatic manner.

　　The attendees of this conference included representatives from the education (culture and education) departments of major administrative regions, the culture and education department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, and the culture and education bureaus of various provinces and cities, as well as local experts, teachers, student representatives, and representatives from relevant central agencies and organizations, totaling 243 people, with 157 people attending as observers.

　　第一次全国中等教育会议开幕
    将解决中等教育的方针、任务等问题
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府教育部于三月十九日召开第一次全国中等教育会议。这次会议的中心任务是要解决：（一）中等教育的方针、任务问题；（二）普通中学的性质、任务、课程、教材以及公私关系等问题；（三）学生健康问题。
    教育部部长马叙伦在开幕词中说：中等教育是我们国家教育建设的重要环节。我们国家的国防建设、经济建设和文化建设等各项工作迫切地需要大量的中等技术人才、小学教师和有中等文化水平的一般干部。这是必须依靠中等教育来培养和供给的。同时，国家的高级建设人才，也需要先经过中等教育来培养。他并指出：由于国家目前财政还有困难，以及人力、物力等客观条件的限制，我们对于一般的中等学校应该注重调整和巩固的工作，为今后的发展准备条件。政府对私立中等学校采取积极扶植、加强领导的方针，并鼓励私人捐资兴学。他又强调地指出各地学校教育必须贯彻“健康第一”的精神。这次会议应该研究出一些具体办法，作成决定，解决学生的健康问题。
    政务院副总理兼文化教育委员会主任郭沫若到会讲话，他首先指出一年以来，中等教育有很大的进步。但是全国中等教育目前的状况，对于人民的实际的需要和国家建设事业的需要来说，还是很不够的。另一方面，目前我们还不能增办很多的学校，容纳大量的学生。因此，我们应着重以提高质量的办法来补救这个问题。我们要把中等学校在现有的条件下办得更好。为国家培育出更多的优秀人材。郭副总理并指出：青年学生在受中等教育的时期是一生很重要的阶段。这对青年一生的前途有极深刻的影响。我们要在中等学校培养青年，使他们具有丰富的知识和技术，高尚的道德和情操，以及健康的体格。
    中央人民政府委员徐特立也到会讲话，他着重指出：拟订课程标准不是容易的事，必须慎重。首先要根据苏联中等学校课程标准的原则，结合我国实际的情况，来拟定适合于我们自己需要的课程标准。他建议与会的代表充分地交换经验，充分地研究，以便使会议能够实事求是地解决这个问题。
    出席这次会议的有各大行政区教育（文教）部、内蒙古自治区人民政府文教部及各省市文教厅、局的代表，各地专家、教师、学生代表及中央有关机关团体代表二百四十三人，列席一百五十七人。
