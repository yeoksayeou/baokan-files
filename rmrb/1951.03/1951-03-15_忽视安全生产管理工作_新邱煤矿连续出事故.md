    Neglecting Safety Production Management Work
    Xinqiu Coal Mine Continues to Have Accidents
    The Xinqiu Coal Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau has recently experienced a series of major accidents. On January 24th, a workmate was killed by a roof fall; on February 8th, a winch three-axis fracture accident occurred; on February 11th, a coal transport train ran over and killed worker Zhang Yuanyou; on February 18th, another child was run over and killed; on February 26th, worker Wang Hanqing was electrocuted in the water source area's power grid. The occurrence of these accidents has caused serious losses to workers' lives and state property, and has affected the Fuxin Mining Bureau's plan to reduce accidents by 70 percent this year.
    Why have so many accidents occurred at the Xinqiu Mine? The main reason is bureaucratic leadership. Mine Director Li Ming never goes down into the pit and does not understand the situation below. There is a lack of safety equipment on site, and the security system is not strict. For example, the accident on the evening of February 21st, in which Zhang Yuanyou was crushed to death by a train on the bridge, occurred because there were no prior regulations prohibiting people from walking on the train bridge. Although there is a highway bridge nearby that can be used, the workers are greedy for shortcuts and walk on the train bridge, and no one has ever stopped them. Even in the days after the accident, workers were still walking on the train bridge, which fully demonstrates the chaos of the mine's security system. The electrocution of Wang Hanqing was mainly due to the lack of safety equipment. The water source area is equipped with a power grid, which was originally scheduled to energize the current at 7:00 pm every night and de-energize it at 6:20 am the next morning. However, there was no electric bell or signal light on the door of the power grid. On the day of the accident, worker Wang Hanqing was taking over the shift at 8:00 am, and entered the factory at 7:40 am. Because the workmate forgot to de-energize on time, Wang Hanqing was unfortunately electrocuted and sacrificed.
    The mine leaders not only failed to humbly examine such serious continuous accidents, but also shirked their responsibilities, claiming that Wang Hanqing's death was due to his own carelessness. I believe that the mine leaders' seriously bureaucratic behavior of being irresponsible to the workers is an intolerable mistake. I hope that they will learn from these bloody lessons, quickly establish a security system, improve safety equipment, and resolutely fight against accidents.

    Editor's Note: Mine Director Li Ming of the Xinqiu Mine often fails to go deep into the site, neglects safety production management, and is irresponsible for the safety of workers' lives. This behavior is a serious mistake. It is hoped that the mine will conduct a comprehensive inspection in accordance with the "Key Points of Safety Production Management for Public and Private Coal Mines" promulgated by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry on November 20th last year, improve safety production management, and strengthen employee safety education to protect the safety of workers. At the same time, a thorough examination must be made of the serious losses suffered in previous continuous accidents in order to learn from experience and lessons.

### 忽视安全生产管理工作  新邱煤矿连续出事故

    忽视安全生产管理工作
    新邱煤矿连续出事故
    阜新矿务局新邱煤矿，最近接连发生重大事故。一月二十四日因冒顶砸死工友一名；二月八日发生绞车三轴折断事故；二月十一日运煤火车压死工人张元友；二月十八日又压死一个小孩；二月二十六日水源地电网电死工人王翰清。这些事故的发生，使工人的生命和国家财产遭受严重损失，并且影响到阜新矿务局今年减少事故百分之七十的计划的实现。
    新邱矿为什么会发生这许多事故呢？主要是领导上的官僚主义。矿长李明平时根本就不下坑，对下面情况不了解。现场缺乏安全设备，保安制度也不严格。如二月二十一日晚，火车在桥上压死张元友的事故，就是因为事先没有规定火车桥不许走人。附近虽然有公路桥可以通行，但工友贪近，都在火车桥上行走，从来也无人制止。甚至在肇事后的几天，还依然有工友在火车桥上走，这充分说明该矿保安制度的紊乱。电死王翰清事故主要是因为缺乏安全设备。水源地设有电网，原规定每晚七时通电流，次晨六时二十分撤电。但电网门上无电铃，无信号灯。发生事故那天，王翰清工友是上午八点接班，七点四十分进厂，因工友忘了按时撤电，因而王翰清不幸触电牺牲了。
    该矿领导上对于这样严重的连续事故，不但未能虚心检讨，反而推卸责任，他们认为王翰清的死，是由于他自己的马虎大意。我觉得该矿领导上这种对工人不负责任的严重官僚主义的行为，是不能容忍的错误，希望他接受这些血的教训，迅速建立保安制度，改进安全设备，坚决向事故作斗争。
                读者  张月亭
    编者按：新邱矿矿长李明经常不深入现场，忽视安全生产管理工作，对工人生命安全毫不负责的行为，是严重的错误。希望该矿根据中央燃料工业部去年十一月二十日所颁布的《公私营煤矿安全生产管理要点》进行全面的检查，改进安全生产管理工作，加强职工安全教育，以保障工人的安全。同时，对以往连续发生事故所遭受的严重损失，必须作深刻的检查，以接受经验教训。
