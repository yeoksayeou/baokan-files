　　Xin'an Cotton Farmers Request Fertilizer Supply
To the Editor:
    Last year, farmers in Xin'an County, Henan Province, made considerable profits from growing cotton. This year, many farmers are preparing to expand their cotton fields, but the fertilizer problem has not been resolved. It is said that the county supply and marketing cooperative sent people to various districts to purchase fertilizer, but so far they have only bought more than 60,000 jin of oilseed cakes, which is far from meeting the needs of the masses. Loans have now been distributed to the masses in various townships, who are trying to purchase fertilizer themselves, but this does not solve the fundamental problem. Farmers in Sundu Township posted advertisements to purchase fertilizer, but they were unable to buy it. I hope that relevant authorities can help farmers solve this specific difficult problem, so as not to reduce cotton planting due to lack of fertilizer.
                                                      Li Fan
    Editor's Note: The task of planting cotton this year is particularly heavy, and the cotton planting season is very short. In order to ensure the realization of the national cotton planting plan, relevant leading authorities in cotton-producing areas should make every effort to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for cotton farmers as soon as possible.

### 新安棉农要求供应肥料

专栏：来信摘要

　　新安棉农要求供应肥料编辑同志：
    河南新安县农民去年栽种棉花收益颇大。今年有不少农民都准备扩大棉田，但肥料问题却得不到解决。据说县供销合作社曾派人到各区收购，至今只买到六万多斤油饼，距群众需要相差甚远。现在已将贷款分发给各乡群众，自己设法购买，但这也解决不了根本问题。孙都乡的农民张贴了购买肥料的广告，也未能买到肥料。我希望有关机关能帮助农民解决这一具体困难问题，不致使农民因缺乏肥料而减少种棉。
                                                      李璠
    编者按：今年种棉的任务特别繁重，而棉花的播种期很短。为了保证全国植棉计划的实现，产棉区有关领导机关应该多方努力，及早解决棉农缺乏肥料的困难。
