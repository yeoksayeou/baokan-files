　　Dong Biwu, Vice Premier, Donates Antiquities
　　Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, donated to the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture a "Decree" scroll given by Emperor Xizong of the Ming Dynasty to Zhao Nanxing and his wife, and a "Iron Ruyi" scepter of Zhao Nanxing. These two antiques were given to Elder Dong by General Chen Yi, Commander of the East China Military Region, in the winter of 1947. At that time, General Chen was commanding the People's Liberation Army in Shandong to fight against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, traversing thousands of miles. In the midst of military affairs, he did not forget the importance of cultural relics, preserving them and sending them to Elder Dong. Elder Dong valued historical and cultural heritage and was unwilling to keep them as private treasures, so he donated them to the public. It is reported that the two antiques will soon be sent to the History Museum for display, so that the general public can have the opportunity to view them.
　　The Broad Masses of Northeast China Love Progressive Films

Soviet films with high ideological and artistic value, thanks to the dubbing in Mandarin, are even more loved by the masses, with the audience increasing tenfold compared to the original version. Conversely, the audience for backward films is gradually decreasing.
