　　Yanjing University Gathers All Teachers, Students, and Staff to Accuse American Imperialist Cultural Aggression

　　Over 1,300 teachers, students, and staff members of Yanjing University held an accusation rally on the 8th of this month, accusing American imperialism of its crimes of cultural aggression at Yanjing University.

　　Since Yanjing University was taken over by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on February 12th, it has launched a patriotic ideological education movement on campus. Departments and grades have held group discussion meetings one after another. The whole university has also held four large-scale discussion meetings. Through these discussion meetings, teachers and students across the university have gained a further understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism. Many people who were unknowingly poisoned by American imperialist cultural aggression in the past have realized the maliciousness of American cultural aggression after this ideological review. Based on this ideological awakening of teachers and students, the Yanjing University Labor Union and the Student Union convened a school-wide accusation rally.

　　Professor Jiang Yin'en, chairman of the conference, said in his opening speech: "We must accuse American imperialism of how it used cultural aggression to make us unknowingly lose our patriotism and self-confidence, and develop the idea of 'America first, China second.' We must resolutely eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression." Then, many professors, students, and workers mournfully recounted the harm that American imperialist cultural aggression had done to them.

　　Student Shen Yusheng said that during the Anti-Japanese War, he saw the corruption of the Kuomintang in the interior, so he was very pessimistic about the future of the country. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he thought that it was only a victory won by the Americans. When the civil war broke out, he felt that there was even less hope for the future of the country. At that time, he lived in Shanghai, and he loved to watch American yellow tabloids, pornographic movies, and novels and magazines about abnormal psychology. As a result, he dreamed of the "American way of life" every day. He became a prisoner of American movies. After seeing the heroine in the movie "Waterloo Bridge" die under the tires of a car, he felt that such a death was very poetic. Several times when he saw a car coming, he wanted to rush over. Speaking of this, Shen Yusheng's face was full of tears, and his voice was hoarse. He said: "If there were no Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I would either lose my conscience and do things that are not human, or die under a car. If Chinese youth were all like me, imperialism would not have to spend a single bullet to destroy China."

　　Student Zhu Yuanjue then took the stage to accuse. She said that due to her father's influence, she had always thought that the United States was a country that upheld justice. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, she saw American soldiers playing "Jeep girls". She did not hate those shameless American soldiers, but hated the "Jeep girls" for being too cheap. After liberation, although she knew that the United States was invading China, and she knew that she should love her country, she also signed up to join the Volunteer Army; but she always felt that the United States had given her something. She once said to others: "You can't say that the United States is all bad. How can you be so unfair? Without the United States, how could I study anatomy at Yanjing University?" Zhu Yuanjue cried and said: "What is this! If someone killed my father and left a knife, how can I say: 'The murderer is not bad after all. He even gave me this knife?!'"

　　Professor Nie Chongqi of the History Department signed a public letter in February 1948 in the so-called "Eighteen Professors of Peiping and Tianjin Calling for 'American Aid'" and slandering the Chinese Communist Party. At the meeting, he read the letter again and said sadly: "I consider myself a person with national integrity. During the occupation, I refused the invitation of the puppet Peking University. But until recently, I realized that calling for 'American aid' is calling for the United States to help Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people and destroy the cause of liberation. Isn't this letting a wolf into the house? Isn't this an act of treason against the people?"

　　Professor Yan Jingyao of the Sociology Department said sadly in his accusation that he worked as a warden in a prison with more than 8,000 prisoners in the Shanghai Public Concession in 1935. He believed that he studied criminology and penology, and working there was putting what he learned into practice. He thought it was glorious that he was "neither humble nor arrogant" to foreigners in prison and received the same salary as foreigners. He said: "In fact, wasn't I just a running dog of imperialism, suppressing the resistance of the Chinese people for imperialism?" Before liberation, most of the reference books he assigned to students were in English. He hoped that they could go to American universities. He said: "Not only have I been deeply poisoned by American imperialist cultural aggression, but I have also passed on these poisons to young people. This is such a serious crime!"

　　Student Li Bingning accused American imperialism of poisoning his personality. From middle school, he devoted himself to reading American books on utilitarianism such as "The Shortcut to Success," "Mental Training," and "Education in Dealing with People." He said: "According to the 'guidance' of these books, I just wanted to be a great man, to control others, to manipulate others, and I never had real feelings for my friends. Dealing with people was like acting in a play. I read these books every day, just thinking about how to climb on top of others, and I forgot all about the motherland and the people." He hated that American imperialist cultural aggression had degraded his personality to this point.

　　Professor Qi Sihe, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, also signed the public letter of "Eighteen Professors of Peiping and Tianjin Calling for 'American Aid'." At that time, he still thought it was a patriotic thing to do. Now he knows that this is recognizing the enemy as a friend and betraying the motherland. He hates that he was a prisoner of American imperialist thought without realizing it. He said: "I am beginning to realize it now. I hate these bloodthirsty executioners!"

　　The accusation meeting has continued for more than four hours, and the participants' emotions have continued to rise. More and more people are asking to speak, but due to time constraints, the meeting cannot be extended any further. Finally, the chairman of the Student Union, Xia Ziqiang, spoke. He pointed out: Everyone realizes that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. In the future, we must strengthen unity and thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression at Yanjing University. The participants were extremely excited. "Down with American imperialism!" "Thoroughly eliminate American cultural aggression!" "All teachers, students and staff unite and run the people's Yanjing University well!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and other slogans shook the entire Yanyuan!

### 燕京大学全校师生员工集会  控诉美帝国主义文化侵略

　　燕京大学全校师生员工集会
    控诉美帝国主义文化侵略
    燕京大学全校师生员工一千三百余人于本月八日举行控诉大会，控诉美帝国主义在燕京大学的文化侵略罪行。
    燕京大学自二月十二日经中央人民政府教育部接管后，即在校内展开爱国主义的思想教育运动。各系、级纷纷召开了小组座谈会。全校并举行了四次大规模的座谈会。经过这些座谈会，全校师生对美帝国主义的侵略本质有了进一步的认识。很多人过去身受美帝国主义文化侵略的毒害而不自觉，经过这次思想检讨后，已认识到美国文化侵略的恶毒。在师生们这种思想觉悟的基础上，燕京大学工会和学生会就召开了全校控诉大会。
    大会主席蒋荫恩教授在致开会词时说：“我们要控诉美帝国主义怎样用文化侵略的手段，使我们在不知不觉中丧失了爱国心、自信心，养成了‘美国第一、中国第二’的思想。我们要坚决肃清美帝国主义文化侵略的影响。”接着许多教授、学生、工友悲愤地诉述了美帝国主义文化侵略给他们的毒害。
    学生沈裕生说，抗战时期，他在内地看见国民党贪污腐化，因此，对国家前途很悲观。抗战胜利了，他以为这只是美国人打胜的。内战爆发了，他觉得国家前途更没有希望了。当时他住在上海，他爱看美国的黄色画报、色情电影、变态心理的小说、杂志。结果，他每天梦想着“美国生活方式”。他做了美国电影的俘虏，他看见《魂断蓝桥》影片里的女主角死在汽车轮胎底下之后，觉得这样的死去很有诗意。有几次他看见汽车过来，就想扑过去。说到这里，沈裕生悲痛得脸上流满泪水，声音也嘶哑了。他说：“如果没有共产党、毛主席，我不是昧了良心去做不是人干的勾当，就是死在汽车底下了。如果中国青年都像我这样，帝国主义要灭亡中国就不必费一枪一弹了。”
    学生朱元珏紧接着上台控诉。她说，她因受父亲的影响，从小就以为美国是维护正义的国家。抗战胜利后，她看见美国兵玩“吉普女郎”，她不恨那些无耻的美国兵，却恨“吉普女郎”太贱。解放后，她虽然知道美国侵略中国，也知道要爱国，她也报名参加志愿军；可是她总觉得美国给了她一些东西。她曾对人说：“你们不能说美国什么都不好，怎么可以这样不公平呢？没有美国，我怎么能在燕京大学念解剖学呢？”朱元珏痛哭失声地说：“这是什么话呵！假如有人杀了我爸爸，留下一把刀子，我怎能说：‘凶手毕竟不错，他还送了这一把刀子给我？！’”
    历史系教授聂崇岐在一九四八年二月曾在所谓平津十八教授呼吁“美援”、污蔑中国共产党的公开信上签过名。会上，他将这封信念了一遍，沉痛地说：“我自认是有民族气节的人。沦陷时，我曾拒绝过伪北京大学的聘请。可是直到最近我才明白呼吁“美援”，就是呼吁美国帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民，摧残解放事业。这不是引狼入室吗？这不是背叛人民的卖国行为吗？”
    社会系教授严景耀在控诉时沉痛地说，他在一九三五年在上海公共租界一个有八千多犯人的监狱里作典狱官。他认为他是学犯罪学和监狱学的，在那里工作正是学以致用。他以为他在监狱里同外国人“不卑不亢”，和外国人拿同等的薪水，是很光荣的。他说：“实际上我不正是做了帝国主义的走狗，为帝国主义镇压中国人民的反抗吗？”解放前，他给学生指定的参考书大多数是英文本子的。他希望他们能上美国大学。他说：“我不仅自己深受美帝国主义文化侵略的毒害，而且还把这些毒害传授给青年。这是多么严重的罪恶！”
    学生黎秉宁控诉美帝国主义毒化了他的人格。他从中学起就专心致意地阅读美国的什么《成功的捷径》、《心理锻炼》、《处世教育》一类的功利主义的书。他说：“根据这些书的‘指导’，我只是想做个伟人，想控制别人，操纵别人，对朋友从来没有真实的感情，对人处世像是在演戏。我每天看这些书，只是想怎样使自己爬到别人头上，把祖国和人民都忘得精光了。”他痛恨美帝国主义文化侵略使他的人格堕落到这种地步。
    文学院院长齐思和教授也曾在平津十八教授呼吁“美援”的公开信上签过名。当时，他还以为那是爱国爱民的事。现在才知道这是认敌为友，是背叛祖国的行为。他恨他自己作了美帝国主义思想俘虏而不自觉。他说：“我现在开始觉悟了，我痛恨这些杀人不见血的刽子手！”
    控诉会已经继续了四个多小时，参加者的情绪不断高涨，要求发言的人愈来愈多，但因受时间限制，大会不能再延长下去。最后由学生会主席夏自强讲话。他指出：大家都认识到美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，今后我们更要加强团结，彻底肃清美帝国主义在燕京大学的文化侵略的影响。与会的人情绪激昂万分。“打倒美帝国主义！”“彻底肃清美国文化侵略！”“全校师生员工团结起来，办好人民的燕京大学！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号震撼了整个燕园！
