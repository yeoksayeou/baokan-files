Great Victory of Mao Zedong's Nationalities Policy!
    — A Review of the Film "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities"
    Bai Sheng

    October 1, 1950, was the first National Day celebration after the birth of New China. The Central People's Government invited representatives of all fraternal nationalities to Beijing to participate in the celebration of this great festival. This was an unprecedented grand gathering of all fraternal nationalities in Chinese history. The documentary film "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," produced by the Beijing Film Studio, is a vivid record of these joyous scenes. These great scenes fully demonstrate the love of all fraternal nationalities for the motherland and the people's leader Chairman Mao, proving the great victory of Mao Zedong's nationalities policy!

    The film first depicts the vastness and beauty of the motherland, allowing you to concretely feel the dignity of the Chinese nation. Then, from the distant borders of the motherland—from the southwest, from the northwest, from the grasslands, from the mountains… the people's representatives of our 42 fraternal nationalities, including Mongolians, Hui, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Miao, and Yi, arrived in the people's capital, Beijing, with boundless joy, amid the earth-shattering cheers of the welcoming crowds. The Young Pioneers of the capital, wearing red scarves, presented bouquets of flowers, smiling and jumping, handing the flowers to the representatives. The waist drum team used loud gongs and drums to express the warmest feelings, welcoming the brothers and sisters of all nationalities. Li Weihan, Chairman of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, personally welcomed them at the station. This was a historic meeting of all nationalities.

    The brothers and sisters of all fraternal nationalities told Chairman Mao about their freedom and happiness after liberation. On the evening they presented gifts to Chairman Mao, they personally offered their most cherished gifts—the clothing and valuable products of their own nationalities—to Chairman Mao. Among them were the beautiful Tibetan saffron and purple pulu, the precious golden umbrella of the Thai people, and various beautiful and exquisite national costumes. When many representatives of different nationalities put on the most precious clothes, hats, and costumes of their own nationalities on Chairman Mao, a great national feeling moved everyone. These brothers and sisters had long lived under the cruel rule and discrimination of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but today they stood up proudly. Look, in front of the glorious five-star red flag, Chairman Mao cordially shook hands with every representative who presented gifts. The countless red brocade banners presented to Chairman Mao were embroidered with words of gratitude: "Chairman Mao! You are the red sun of the eastern nationalities," "Chairman Mao, you are the great savior of the oppressed nationalities," "Like the sun, you are a treasure of light!"

    On the eve of National Day, Chairman Mao held a grand banquet to celebrate the great unity of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China.

    While the representatives of all nationalities were joyously gathering in the people's capital, the news of the flames of aggression by American imperialism nearing our border arrived, arousing the anger of the representatives of all nationalities. They unanimously signed the declaration to defend peace, expressing their determination to resist aggression and defend the motherland.

    On National Day, October 1, 1950, on the square in front of the magnificent Tiananmen Gate, these representatives of outstanding people from all remote areas of the motherland, and the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—outstanding combat heroes and model workers—met warmly. The representatives, wearing colorful national costumes, reviewed our mighty armed forces and the people's parade with Chairman Mao, and indescribable excitement and emotion were expressed on the faces of every national representative. They cheered the great victory of the people's motherland!

    Amidst the cheering and inspiring great celebration of the National Day of New China, the capital held a 40,000-person grand gathering of Chinese nationalities. In the parade around the field, the sons and daughters from the Inner Mongolian grasslands of the motherland passed by; the brothers and sisters from the northwestern corner of the motherland passed by; the brothers and sisters from the remote deep mountains of the southwest passed by; the Korean brothers and sisters from the northeastern border of the motherland passed by. They all wore the costumes of their own nationalities and passed by amidst bursts of warm applause and cheers. This is a microcosm of the great unity of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China. This great national unity is the copper wall and iron bastion that defends the motherland and the powerful force that guarantees peace in the Far East and the world.

    The representatives of all fraternal nationalities also used folk songs and dances with national characteristics to express their thoughts and feelings. They sang about their liberation, sang about their new life after liberation, sang about the great motherland, and sang about the people's leader Chairman Mao!

    Listen, the brothers and sisters of the Southwest Nationalities Cultural Troupe are singing about the freedom and joy of being liberated from the national oppression of the Han chauvinism of the Kuomintang reactionaries. How intimate and moving the song is:

    Last October 1st,
    New China was established,
    The people of the southwest were still suffering,
    Hoping for liberation,
    Hoping for liberation,
    Thinking of Chairman Mao day and night.

    This October 1st,
    The southwest has changed,
    Representatives of fraternal nationalities come to Beijing,
    To celebrate National Day,
    To see our benefactor Chairman Mao.
　
    Then, on a vast grassland, the Tibetan men and women from Xikang danced the "Xianzi Dance." The Yi people from the Daliang Mountains of Xikang danced the "Friendship Dance." The Miao people from the Qingshui River area of eastern Guizhou also danced the "Square Dance" to the sound of drums. The Axi and Sani people from the western and Guishan areas of Yunnan danced the beautiful folk dance—"Jumping the Moon." The Lusheng flute sounded, and two Miao children played the Lusheng flute and danced the "Lusheng Dance." The outstanding actors of the Xinjiang Cultural Troupe from the northwest corner sang the rich life and customs of the fraternal nationalities living in the vast and fertile land of the Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, and the Ili River basin in Xinjiang. The songs and dances of the Uyghur and Kazakh people fully demonstrate the happy and beautiful life of the people of Xinjiang today. A group of vigorous sons and daughters from the Mongolian grasslands also brought the art and national scenery of the Mongolian people. They brought the happiness of the grasslands after liberation and the respect of the people of Inner Mongolia. The magnificent "Saber Dance" vividly depicts the life of the heroic cavalry of the Inner Mongolian people. The outstanding actors of the Yanbian Cultural Troupe from Jilin Province, on the northeastern border of the motherland, also brought the gratitude and love of the 1.5 million Korean people in the northeast to Chairman Mao. This series of wonderful, outstanding, and moving performances received warm applause from the audience. Each program was full of high national ideological feelings and genius wisdom.

    At the end of the film, the representatives of all nationalities, gloriously wearing the new uniforms given to them by Chairman Mao, left Beijing by special train with joy and excitement.

    "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" is not an ordinary documentary, but a magnificent scroll depicting the great unity of Chinese nationalities. The entire structure of the film is not monotonous, with vivid and prominent shots and many realistic portrayals of details. The arrangement and treatment, in general, is appropriate. This documentary is very educational for the audience, demonstrating the great victory of Mao Zedong's nationalities policy and the invincible power of the great unity of all nationalities in New China!

　　毛泽东民族政策的伟大胜利！
    ——《中国民族大团结》影片评介
    柏生
    一九五○年十月一日，是新中国诞生后的第一个国庆纪念节。中央人民政府邀请了各兄弟民族的代表来京参加这个伟大节日的庆祝典礼。这是中国历史上空前未有的各兄弟民族大欢聚。北京电影制片厂摄制的纪录片《中国民族大团结》，就是这些欢聚场面的生动的纪录。这些伟大场面充分表现了各兄弟民族对祖国和人民领袖毛主席的热爱，证明了毛泽东民族政策的伟大胜利！
    影片首先描绘了祖国的辽阔和美丽，使你具体感觉到中华民族的尊严。于是从祖国遥远的边疆——从西南，从西北，从草原，从山区，……我们蒙、回、藏、维、苗、彝等四十二个兄弟民族的人民代表，带着无限的喜悦，在欢迎队伍的惊天动地的欢呼声中，来到了人民的首都北京城。结着红领巾的首都少年儿童队员们，捧着一簇簇的鲜花，笑着、跳着，把鲜花送到代表们的手里。腰鼓队用响亮的锣鼓声来表现最亲切的感情，迎接着各民族的兄弟姊妹们。中央民族事务委员会主任李维汉和北京市人民政府副市长吴晗亲自在车站欢迎。这是各族人民的历史性会见。
    各兄弟民族的兄弟姊妹们，都把翻身后的自由和幸福告诉毛主席。在他们给毛主席献礼的那个晚上，他们亲手把最珍重的礼物——自己民族的服饰和名贵的产品——敬献给毛主席。其中有藏族美丽的藏红花、紫氆氇，泰族的贵重的金伞，以及各种美丽精致的民族服装。当许多不同民族的代表把自己民族最珍贵的衣帽服饰穿戴到毛主席的身上时，一种伟大的民族感情感动了每一个人。这些兄弟姊妹们曾经长期生活在国民党反动派的残酷统治和歧视下，今天他们骄傲地站起来了。你看，在光辉的五星国旗前，毛主席亲切地和每一个献礼的代表握手。那献给毛主席的无数面红色锦旗上，都绣着感激的字句：“毛主席！你是东方各民族的红太阳”“毛主席，你是被压迫民族的大救星”“像太阳一般，你就是光明的宝藏！”
    在国庆节的前夜，毛主席举行了盛大的宴会来庆祝中华人民共和国各民族的大团结，
    当各族代表正热烈地欢聚在人民首都的时候，美帝国主义的侵略火焰烧近我国边境的消息传来了，引起了各族代表的愤怒。他们一致起来在保卫和平的宣言上签名，表示了反抗侵略、保卫祖国的决心。
    在一九五○年十月一日的国庆节，在雄伟壮丽的天安门前的广场上，这些来自祖国辽远地区的各族优秀人民的代表，和中国人民的优秀儿女们——出色的战斗英雄和劳动模范们热烈地会见了。代表们穿着各色的民族盛装，和毛主席一起检阅了我们雄壮的武装队伍和人民的游行行列，说不出来的兴奋和感动，表现在每一个民族代表的脸上。他们欢呼着人民祖国的伟大胜利！
    在欢呼鼓舞的新中国国庆节的大庆祝声中，首都举行了四万人的中华各民族联欢大会。在绕场游行的行列中，那来自祖国内蒙古草原上的儿女们走过去了；那来自祖国西北角的兄弟姊妹们走过去了；那来自僻远的西南深山里的兄弟姊妹们走过去了；那来自东北边疆朝鲜族兄弟姊妹们走过去了。他们都穿着自己民族的盛装，在人们一阵阵热烈的掌声和欢呼声中走过去了。这是中华人民共和国各民族大团结的缩影。这民族大团结就是捍卫祖国的铜墙铁壁，是保障远东和世界和平的强大力量。
    各兄弟民族的代表们还用富有民族特色的歌舞来表现自己的思想感情。他们歌唱自己的解放，歌唱解放后的新生活，歌唱伟大的祖国，歌唱人民领袖毛主席！
    你听，西南各民族文工团的兄弟姊妹，歌唱着他们从国民党反动派的大汉族主义的民族压迫下解放出来的自由和愉快，歌声是多么亲切，多么动人：
    去年十月一，
    新中国建立起，
    西南人民还在苦难里，
    盼望着翻身，
    盼望着解放，
    日夜想念毛主席。
　
    今年十月一，
    西南变了样，
    兄弟民族代表来北京，
    庆祝国庆节，
    来见咱们恩人毛主席。
    ……
    接着，在一片广阔的草原上，那来自西康的藏族男女，跳起了“弦子舞”。来自西康大凉山上的彝族跳起了“朋友舞”。来自黔东清水江一带的苗家，也随着鼓声跳起了“四方舞”。云南西山区和圭山区的阿西族和撒尼族，跳起了美丽的土风舞——“跳月”。芦笛响了，两个苗族孩子一边吹着芦笛一边跳起了“芦笙舞”。那来自西北角的新疆文工团的优秀演员们，唱出了居住在新疆天山、阿尔泰山和伊犁河流域的广阔肥沃土地上的各兄弟民族丰富的生活情调。维吾尔族人民和哈萨克人民的歌声和舞蹈，充分地显示了今天新疆人民的幸福美好的生活。从蒙古草原上来到的一群矫健的儿女，也把蒙古人民的艺术和民族风光带来了。他们把翻身后的草原上的幸福带来了，把内蒙古人民的敬意带来了。雄壮的“马刀舞”生动地描绘了内蒙古人民英勇骑兵的生活。那来自祖国东北边疆的吉林省的延边文工团的优秀演员，也带来了东北境内的一百五十万朝鲜族人民对毛主席的感激和热爱。这一连串的精彩优秀动人的表演节目，受到了广大观众的热烈掌声。每一个节目都充满了高度的民族思想感情和天才智慧。
    在影片的末尾，各族代表光荣地穿着毛主席赠送给他们的新制服，带着满怀的喜悦和兴奋，乘着专车离开了北京城。
    《中国民族大团结》不是一部普通的纪录片，而是一部描绘中国民族大团结的辉煌画卷。影片的全部结构穿插，并不显得单调，有生动突出的镜头，也有许多细节的真实写照，编排和处理，一般说来，是适当的。这部纪录片给与观众的教育是很大的，它说明了毛泽东民族政策的伟大胜利，说明了新中国各民族大团结的无敌力量！（附图片）
