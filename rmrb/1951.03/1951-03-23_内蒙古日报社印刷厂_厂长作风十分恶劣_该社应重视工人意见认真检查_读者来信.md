Inner Mongolia Daily Printing Factory
Director's extremely bad work style
The company should pay attention to workers' opinions and conduct careful inspections
Comrades Editors:
	The director of the Inner Mongolia Daily Printing Factory and secretary of the factory's CCP branch, Li Jie, has a serious non-proletarian work style in his leadership, which has affected the factory's work and reduced the Party's prestige among the workers.
	1. Director Li Jie's work style is extremely improper. He consistently suppresses democracy. Anyone who offers opinions to the director will be retaliated against, even dismissed. He frequently engages in improper relationships with women. The workers in the factory are very dissatisfied. Comrades Wang Wenhua and Fan Wuchen were dismissed on trumped-up charges because they gave the director their opinions. Apprentice Lu Yusheng, unable to withstand the director's threats, bought 10,000 yuan worth of mercury to commit suicide by poisoning. The head and deputy head of the casting section disagreed, but Director Li did not take correct measures to resolve the issue, leading the deputy head Huang Chunxue to attempt suicide by hanging. Recently, because workers were dissatisfied with Director Li Jie's leadership, no less than twenty people have left the factory, causing great losses to the work. But on the other hand, those who are willing to flatter him have been promoted to leadership positions. For example, Wang Xichang, whose skills were not high and who had no prestige among the masses, is now the chairman of the trade union and a member of the factory management committee. Shang Zhicheng bought the director a few drinks, and he became the trade union's production committee member. As long as someone is a sycophant of the director, not only can their wages be increased, but their organizational problems can also be solved. Wang Shufang was admitted to the Party because she introduced a spouse to Director Li Jie. Therefore, unprincipled people surround the unprincipled director, forming the factory's leadership group. Upright workers have developed concerns, trembling in fear that the director will take away their jobs. This has caused the factory's leadership to be seriously detached from the masses.
	2. In production, Director Li Jie, in order to pursue quantity, only asks workers to work overtime, so the quality of the products is poor, the printing is blurred, and errors are rampant. Because the labor force is not organized reasonably, the production of each section is disjointed and unconnected. Sometimes the typesetting section is busy, while the machines are idle. When it is time to print, if it can't be done, they work overtime. Section head Zhao Jingfang forced the sick Zhang Haishan to work the night shift, which worsened Zhang Haishan's condition. He does not inspire workers to unleash their enthusiasm for production, but simply assigns work tasks every month, simply requiring completion and exceeding the quota. The director himself does not study, so he is indifferent to the workers' studies. The newspaper office has a workers' spare-time school, but workers attend classes very few times each month, as most of the time is taken up by meetings and overtime. Regarding workers' mistakes, he does not adopt a method that combines education and punishment, but rather mechanically stipulates: being late three times results in one day's wage being deducted, being late fifteen minutes is considered one day's absence, and spoiled items are compensated for at a discount. But the director himself can be late due to drinking, and the director's cronies can spoil items without compensation.
	3. In his work, Director Li Jie likes to exaggerate achievements and cover up shortcomings. The achievements created by the workers have all become his "effective leadership." Conversely, when there are undeniable shortcomings in the work, he either attributes them to objective reasons or puts them on the workers, so everyone says: "The merit is Li Jie's, and the mistakes and shortcomings are other people's." At the model worker selection conference held in Chahar Province in February of this year, he fabricated a set of model worker deeds for himself. He said that he "formulated clear and detailed production plans," "implemented the mass line of coming from the masses and going to the masses," and "implemented a patriotic production competition in December, with production exceeding the plan by 218%." These are completely inconsistent with the facts.
	The above is only the main part of Director Li Jie's work style, and there are many other problems. If this leadership style is not quickly corrected, it will cause serious losses to the printing factory's work.

Editor's note: The work style of Li Jie, the director of the Inner Mongolia Daily Printing Factory, has completely lost the proletarian standpoint and has no Communist Party member's spirit whatsoever. We suggest that the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Daily should pay attention to the readers' reflections, launch a mass inspection of the leadership's work, and give Li Jie the punishment he deserves according to the severity of the errors he has committed. Only in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm of the factory's workers, can we run the factory well, and can we restore the Party's prestige among the masses.

　　内蒙古日报社印刷厂
    厂长作风十分恶劣
    该社应重视工人意见认真检查编辑同志：
    内蒙古日报社印刷厂厂长兼该厂中共支部书记李捷在领导上存在严重的非无产阶级的作风，影响了工厂的工作并降低了党在工人中的威信。
    一、李捷厂长作风极不正派，一贯压制民主，谁给厂长提意见，谁就会遭受他的报复，甚至被解雇开除，他经常搞不正当的男女关系。厂里工人很不满意。工友王文华、范戊臣因为给厂长提意见，便被借故开除了。学徒吕玉生因不堪厂长威胁，买了一万元的水银欲服毒自杀。铸造股正副股长意见不和，李厂长不采取正确的方法来解决，致使副股长黄春学欲悬梁自缢。最近工人因为对李捷厂长的领导不满，前后离厂者不下二十余人，使工作遭受了很大的损失。但在另一方面，肯于奉承他的人都被提拔到领导地位。如王锡昌本来技术不高，在群众中毫无威信，现在当了工会主任和工厂管理委员会的委员。尚志成请厂长喝了几回酒，就成了工会的生产委员。只要是对厂长拍马屁的人，不但工资能提高，还能解决组织问题。王淑芳就是因为给李捷厂长介绍了爱人，所以入了党。因此，无原则的人围绕着无原则的厂长，就形成了工厂的领导集团。正派的工人都产生了顾虑，战战兢兢的怕厂长打了自己的饭碗。这就使工厂的领导严重地脱离了群众。
    二、在生产上，李捷厂长为了追求数量，只要求工人加班加点，因此产品质量不佳，印刷模糊，错误百出。因为劳动力组织不合理，各股生产脱节，互不衔接，有的时候做版忙，而机器闲着，到时印不出来就加班加点。机器股长赵景芳强迫有病的张海山加夜班，结果使张海山的病加重了。不启发工人发挥其生产积极性，只是每月分配工作任务，单纯的要求完成和超过。厂长自己不学习，因此对工人的学习也漠不关心。报社设有工人业余学校，但工人每月上课的次数很少，大多数时间都被开会和加班占用了。对待工人的错误，不是采取教育和处罚相结合的方法，而是机械的规定：迟到三次扣一天工资，迟到十五分钟就算旷工一天，印坏了东西就折价赔偿。但厂长自己却可以因饮酒而迟到，厂长的亲信印坏了东西也可以不赔。
    三、李捷厂长在工作上好夸大成绩，掩饰缺点。工人所创造的成绩尽成了他的“领导有方”。相反地工作上有不可掩藏的缺点时，不是推到客观原因就是加在工人头上，因此大家都说：“功是李捷的，错误和缺点是人家的”。在本年二月察哈尔省召开评选模范大会时，他给自己捏造一套劳动模范事迹。说他“订出了明确周密的生产计划”、“执行了从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线”、“在十二月份实行了爱国主义生产竞赛，生产超过了计划百分之二百一十八”这些完全与事实不符。
    以上说的，仅是李捷厂长作风的主要部分，其他问题还多。这种领导作风如不迅速纠正，将使印刷厂的工作遭受严重的损失。
    读者  张海山、额为敦阿古拉、额为巴拉、武录、潮克、农乃、铁柱、白锐、苏和、满都、黄守仁
    编者按：内蒙古日报社印刷厂长李捷的作风，完全丧失了无产阶级的立场，没有丝毫共产党员的气息。我们建议内蒙古日报社领导上要重视读者的反映，开展一个群众性的检查领导工作，并根据李捷所犯错误的严重程度，给以应得的处分。只有这样，才能发动起该厂工人的积极性，才能把工厂办好，也才能挽回党在群众中的威信。
