Central People's Government Ministry of Railways
    Report on the Summary of Work in 1950 and the Plan for 1951
    (Report by Minister Teng Daiyuan at the 68th Executive Meeting of the Government Administration Council on January 19, 1951, and approved by the same meeting)
            First, the work situation in 1950:
    The guiding principle for railway work in 1950 was to reinforce and improve operational lines, develop planned transportation, and survey new lines, with partial construction. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the assistance and supervision of governments at all levels, the military, and the broad masses of the people, and the efforts of all railway workers, the Railway Engineering Corps, and the railway public security forces over the past year, overcoming various difficulties, the annual transportation plan was completed 21 days ahead of schedule, fulfilling the railway work tasks given by the state in 1950.
            (1) Railway Equipment:
    In 1950, the total operational mileage increased by more than 1,000 kilometers compared to 1949. Maintenance of lines, bridges, culverts, as well as the restoration of double tracks, increasing the number of tracks within stations, building branch lines, water towers, water cranes, etc., were all better than in 1949. Railway factories performed well in repairing rolling stock, and the number of locomotives and vehicles also increased, ensuring the required number of vehicles in operation.
    In 1950, the average train speed increased by 5 to 25 kilometers per hour compared to 1949, and passenger train travel speed increased by 13.8 percent. The national freight train travel speed increased by 7.1 percent compared to the puppet Manchukuo railway in 1941. Train density increased by 2.4 percent to 100 percent. After adjustments, train densities on all lines gradually moved towards equilibrium.
    Communication construction and signal repair allowed all railways in the country, except for the Southwest region and new lines, to hold telephone conferences; major trunk lines had traffic signals. This fundamentally changed the poor conditions that had existed on the railways for decades and ensured the early completion of the state transportation tasks. However, due to long-term war damage, these poor conditions have not been (and could not be) completely changed within one year.
            (2) Transportation Plan:
    The annual transportation plan formulated at the beginning of 1950 focused on shortening the turnaround time of vehicles, requiring the average turnaround time in 1950 to be shortened from 4.38 days in December 1949 to 3.72 days. However, due to vigorous efforts to rectify transportation order, the actual turnaround time was shorter than the original plan. The average daily number of loaded wagons throughout the year exceeded the plan by 7.4 percent, the total freight tonnage for the year exceeded the plan by 2.8 percent, and the total number of passenger trips for the year exceeded the plan by 5.8 percent. At the same time, passenger car equipment and passenger order were improved. Train departures and arrivals were most punctual in June. Passenger trains departing on time accounted for 99.4 percent, and arrivals accounted for 96.9 percent; freight trains departing on time accounted for 97.7 percent, and arrivals accounted for 92.7 percent. In winter, the weather was cold, and we were a little lax in our leadership, so the on-time ratio decreased, which shows that mastering railway transportation is a constant and intense combat task, and we cannot relax for a moment.
            (3) Business Revenue and Expenditure:
    In 1950, the railway's operating income and non-operating income exceeded the original plan by 17 percent, while expenditures only exceeded the original plan by 4 percent (the excess in expenditure was mainly due to material price issues).
            (4) Employee Statistics:
    According to statistics in November 1950, the number of employees increased compared to 1949 (not including the Engineering Bureau). However, in terms of personnel ratio, technical and business employees were three to four compared to non-technical and business employees, with more non-technical personnel and insufficient technical personnel. Taking locomotive drivers as an example, if calculated based on the contracted crew system (including drivers, assistant drivers, and instructing drivers), there is a shortage of several thousand people. In view of the gradual development of railways, training technical workers is an urgent task to be solved.
            (5) General Review:
    In the work of 1950, the principle of relying on workers and focusing on production was emphasized. Through the call and mobilization of the "February 7th" National Railway Trade Union Representatives Conference, rationalization proposals and new record creation movements were launched. The Iron Ox movement was launched in the Northeast, the Model Locomotive Team movement was launched in Guannei (areas inside the Shanhaiguan Pass), and recently, a patriotic production competition movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has been launched throughout the railway system. In the technical departments, advanced Soviet experiences were widely adopted, such as the responsibility system, new road maintenance methods, new shunting methods, new tank cleaning methods, and new maintenance systems. The level of awareness of workers nationwide has also generally improved, resulting in a large number of model heroic deeds. The Mao Zedong and Iron Ox locomotives have always maintained their heroic titles and broke the record of safe mileage of 200,000 kilometers. Under their influence, there are already 148 locomotives nationwide that have broken the safe mileage of 100,000 kilometers. In 1950, each freight locomotive averaged 336.7 kilometers, an increase of one-quarter compared to 1949, and more than one-third compared to the Northeast Railway during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1942. The six railway bureaus in Guannei saved about 310,000 tons of coal, saving the country about 400 million catties of millet. In terms of complying with regulations, Taian Station had no accidents for 734 consecutive days, and Chunyang Station had no accidents for 1,055 days. The Changchun Railway utilized spare labor time and collected materials to repair 92 freight cars. A mass movement to collect and inventory materials was carried out nationwide, and inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals were widely launched on-site. As for the troops participating in the construction of new lines, they created a record of completing an average of four cubic meters of earthwork per day in mountainous areas, which further demonstrated the excellent qualities and organization of the People's Army.
    In the past year, in cooperation with the trade union, some work has also been done in the areas of employee welfare and labor protection. At present, there are a total of 269 supply stores nationwide, including 202 trainman apartments (including reorganized old ones), 171 canteens, 401 bathhouses, 287 barbershops, and sanatoriums and rest homes with a total of 1,660 beds, as well as clubs, nurseries, etc. At the same time, more than 130,000 employees were organized for after-work cultural studies, and an award system was implemented for employee overproduction, new record creation, and rationalization proposals. Railway work in 1950 achieved such great results precisely because we implemented the correct principle of "relying on workers and focusing on production" and obtained strong cooperation from the trade union, which is the fundamental aspect.
    However, on the other hand, from our leadership's perspective, there are still many shortcomings and errors. At the beginning of last year, several major accidents and the Zhengzhou water tower contracting corruption case occurred, reflecting the serious bureaucracy in our work, and the more specific the problem, the less responsibility was taken. The tasks of each bureau in the annual plan were excessively light or heavy, and adjustments were not made until August. Although seasonal balanced transportation was proposed, there was a lack of effective organizational work, resulting in an average daily retention of several thousand in-use cars in the summer. There was a common problem of only looking at quantity and not quality, completing tasks without accounting, and not doing design plans and budgets before construction, and not doing final accounts after completion, not asking about costs, which is basically a "supply" mentality. When the leadership's inspection of the number of loaded wagons and turnover rate was insufficient, there were also cases of counting mid-way ticket changes as loaded wagons, and the quality of locomotive and vehicle maintenance was not good; locomotives after major repairs were required to run 300,000 kilometers, but the national average in the first half of last year was only 92,000 kilometers. The situation of rework was serious, with some trial runs reaching as many as 18 times. In terms of line repair, some areas transported too much ballast, unloaded it, and then transported it away again; some sleepers that could still be used for one or two years were replaced, and the efficiency of major and medium line repairs was wasted, exceeding the standard by more than two times. The unified rules and regulations were not strictly grasped and implemented throughout the railway system, resulting in many accidents caused by violations of regulations and discipline. In December, not only did it not decrease, but it also showed an upward trend, indicating that our ability to fight accidents is not strong. The work was characterized by egalitarianism in the use of forces, without focus, with many documents and meetings, creating a situation of busyness above and chaos below. To cite the investigation materials of Jinan Locomotive Depot in November as an example: the depot held 156 meetings in the whole month, there were 178 kinds of reports, 221 documents, and 17 reports to superiors. Many leading cadres spent their limited energy and time on unprepared meetings and in wastepaper baskets.
    Why did these problems occur? First, because some of our leading cadres are accustomed to accepting abstract tasks and arranging work abstractly, they are not accustomed to realizing leadership through concrete organizational work. The task is contracted out, but the concrete organization of the masses to realize it is done very poorly, especially the experience of advanced elements among the masses is often ignored, or only mentioned verbally and rewarded, lacking timely summarization and promotion, so the production enthusiasm of the masses fluctuates, or self-generated and self-extinguished. In the first half of the year, the phenomenon of working overtime was more common, which wasted the enthusiasm of the masses and harmed their health. According to extremely incomplete statistics from January to October 1950 (only three or four months of figures for individual bureaus), the national railways had a total of 996,487 man-days of work-related injuries and sick leave, indicating that the waste of labor force was very large. Second, it is easy to be dazzled by superficial achievements and ignore the unreliable and unconsolidated things that occur at all times in the process of advancement. For example, it is emphasized that the progress of on-time train operation is very fast, but at the same time, freight trains are using limited-point changes to create on-time performance. The number of loaded wagons and turnaround time also have false situations. Third, using the experience of repairing old lines to engage in new construction projects, therefore, the complex process of design, planning, and organization is ignored, and thus cost accounting is not carried out, which not only causes waste of manpower and materials, but also fails to complete the task.
    In summary, in terms of leadership methods, there is a bureaucratic work style that is divorced from reality. After rectification for the past six months since May last year, some improvements have been made and are continuing to be made; but thoroughly improving the work style is still a long-term and continuous struggle.
    The above is the work situation of the national railways in 1950.
            Second, the guiding principles and tasks for 1951:
    According to the central financial and economic guiding principles and the current situation of the national railways, we believe that the guiding principle for railway work in 1951 should be: continue to carry out patriotic ideological education to resist US aggression and aid Korea, further mobilize the mass movement to create new records; universally establish the concept of economic accounting, and implement it with emphasis; focus on giving full play to human resources on business and lines, carry out road maintenance, and complete transportation tasks; continue surveying and designing on new construction lines, and carry out key construction with preparation; in financial work, strive to increase income, save expenses, and strictly implement the budget and final accounts system.
    According to the above guiding principles, the outline of the 1951 work plan is as follows:
    (1) National Transportation Plan:
    The total freight tonnage will increase by 7.35 percent compared to 1950, the total extended ton-kilometers will increase by 25.3 percent compared to 1950, and the average daily number of loaded wagons will increase by 10 percent. Passenger transport will be more than 151 million people, and the total extended passenger-kilometers will be 20 billion kilometers. The total average turnaround time of freight cars for the whole year will be 3.33 days, shortening by 0.39 days compared to 1950, and eliminating some false turnover figures. At the same time, a large number of direct trains will be organized to lengthen the turnaround distance. Operating income should increase by 10 percent compared to 1950.
    (2) Basic Construction Plan (omitted).
    (3) Strengthen cost calculation, establish statistical work in grassroots units through mass movements to determine standard quotas, in preparation for the full implementation of the economic accounting system, and conduct key trials in various bureaus, with a plan to implement the economic accounting system nationwide within two years.
    (4) New construction lines should strengthen preparation work and start construction after thorough preparation. Ongoing new road projects should strengthen organization and leadership. The plan for 1952 should be prepared early.
    (5) Strengthen supervision and auditing work, universally carry out the study of regulations, rules, and laws, cultivate the habit of all railway employees to abide by them, and resolutely implement labor discipline and financial discipline.
    (6) Continue to carry out the patriotic production competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea, promote rationalization proposals, new record movements, model locomotive team movements, and implement the responsibility system and contract system. Prepare to convene a railway hero model conference in 1951 in conjunction with the National Railway Trade Union to summarize the creative experience of the workers and masses, promote it to the national railways, and further advance the national railway work.

　　中央人民政府铁道部
    关于一九五零年工作总结与一九五一年计划的报告
    （滕代远部长一九五一年一月十九日在政务院第六十八次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
            第一、一九五○年的工作情况：
    一九五○年铁路工作的方针，是补强通车线路，开展计划运输，并勘测新路，部分施工。由于毛主席和中央人民政府的领导，各级人民政府、军队和广大人民的协助与监督，经过全体铁路职工、铁道兵团和铁路公安部队一年来的努力，克服各种困难，提前二十一天完成了年度运输计划，完成了一九五○年国家所给与的铁路工作任务。
            （一）铁路设备：
    一九五○年总通车里程较一九四九年增加一千多公里。在维修线路、桥梁、涵洞以及修复复线、增加站内股道、修建支线、水塔、水鹤等等方面，均较一九四九年为佳，铁路工厂修车成绩很好，机车车辆也有增加，保证了运用车的需要数量。
    一九五○年行车速度每小时平均较一九四九年提高了五至二十五公里，客车旅行速度提高了百分之十三点八。全国货车旅行速度较一九四一年伪满铁路提高了百分之七点一。行车密度提高了百分之二点四到百分之百。各线行车密度经过调整，都逐渐走向平衡。
    通信建设和号志的修理，使全国铁路，除西南区及新线外，均可举行电话会议；主要干线都有了行车号志。基本上改变了铁路上几十年来所存在的恶劣状况，并保证了提前完成国家运输任务。但由于长期战争的破坏，这种恶劣状况还没有（而且也不可能）在一年之内完全改变过来。
            （二）运输计划：
    一九五○年初制定的年度运输计划，着重在缩短车辆的周转时间，要求一九五○年的平均周转时间从一九四九年十二月份的四点三八天，缩短为三点七二天。但由于大力整顿运输秩序，实际周转时间较原定计划缩短。全年平均每日装车数超过计划百分之七点四，全年货运总吨数超过计划百分之二点八，全年客运人数超过计划百分之五点八。同时改善了客车设备及旅客秩序。列车正点发车、到达，以六月份情况为最好。客车正点出发占百分之九九点四，到达占百分之九六点九；货车正点出发占百分之九七点七，到达占百分之九二点七；冬季天寒，加以我们领导上抓的松了一点，正点比例下降，这就说明掌握铁路运输是一个经常的紧张的战斗任务，一时一刻也松懈不得。
            （三）营业收支：
    一九五○年度关内铁路营业收入及营业以外的收入，超过原定计划百分之十七，而支出仅超过原定计划百分之四（支出超过主要是由于材料价格问题）。
            （四）员工统计：
    根据一九五○年十一月份统计，较一九四九年增加了（尚不包括工程局在内）。但在人员的比例上，技术业务员工与非技术业务员工为三比四，非技术人员有多，而技术人员不足。以司机人员论，如以包乘制计算（包括司机、副司机、指导司机），尚缺好几千人，鉴于铁路的逐年发展，培养技术职工是当前急需解决的任务。
            （五）总的检讨：
    在一九五○年工作中，强调了依靠工人、面向生产的方针。通过“二七”全国铁路工会代表会的号召和动员，开展了合理化建议和创造新纪录运动，在东北开展了铁牛运动，在关内开展了模范机车队运动，最近全路又开展了抗美援朝的生产竞赛运动。在技术部门中则广泛地采取了苏联先进经验，如负责制、新养路法、新调车法、新洗罐法、新检修制等。全国职工觉悟程度也普遍提高，产生了大批模范英雄事迹，毛泽东号、铁牛号机车始终保持英雄的称号，并且突破了安全走行二十万公里的纪录，在他们的影响之下，全国突破安全走行十万公里的机车已有一四八台。每台货物机车一九五○年平均走行三三六点七公里，比一九四九年增加四分之一，比一九四二年伪满时期的东北铁路超过三分之一。关内六个路局节省煤约合三十一万吨，为国家节省小米约四亿斤。在遵守规章方面，泰安车站连续七三四天无事故，春阳车站一、○五五天无事故。中长路利用剩余劳动时间和搜集材料，修复了九十二辆货车。全国进行了群众性的搜集清查材料运动，在现场普遍展开了发明创造与合理化建议。至于部队参加新线修建，曾在山陵地区创造每日平均完工四个土方的纪录，更表现了人民军队的优良品质和组织性。
    一年来与工会合作，对于职工的福利与劳动保护方面也作了若干工作。现全国前后共设供给商店二六九个，包括整理旧有的在内有行车公寓二○二处，食堂一七一个，浴池四○一所，理发所二八七个，疗养院及休养所共有床位一、六六○个，其他尚有俱乐部、托儿所等。同时组织了十三万余职工的业余文化学习，对职工的超额生产、新纪录创造与合理化建议实行了奖励制度。一九五○年的铁路工作，正由于我们执行了“依靠工人，面向生产”的正确方针，并取得工会方面的有力配合，使全国铁路获得这样巨大的成绩，这是基本的一面。
    但另一方面，从我们领导上检查，还存在很多缺点和错误。去年初曾发生了几件重大事故及郑州水塔包工贪污案，反映我们工作中存在着严重的官僚主义，越是具体问题，越是负责不够。年度计划中各局任务畸轻畸重，拖到八月才加以调整。季节平衡运输虽经提出，而缺少切实的组织工作，以致在夏季平均每日保留使用车达数千辆。只看数量不问质量，完成任务不算账，是普遍的毛病；施工前不做设计计划预算，竣工后不做决算，不问成本，基本上是一种“供给”思想。装车数与周转率领导上检查不够时，也发生中途换票也算装车，机车车辆的检修质量不好；大修后的机车规定走三十万公里，而全国去年上半年平均仅为九万二千公里。反工情况严重，有的试运达十八次之多。线路补修方面，有些地区石碴运去太多，卸下后重又运走；枕木有的还能用一两年的也换下来，线路大中修工率浪费，有超过标准两倍的。对统一的规章制度掌握不严，没有在全路上加紧学习，贯彻执行，以致违反规章破坏纪律发生事故很多。在十二月份不仅没有减少，且有上升之势。表现我们对事故斗争的能力不强。工作上平均主义使用力量，没有重点，公文多，开会多，造成上忙下乱现象。只举济南机务段十一月份调查材料为例：该段全月开会一五六次，表报有一七八种，公文二二一件，向上报告十七件，许多领导干部把有限的精力时间，消耗在无准备的会议上和字纸篓里边。
    为什么会发生这些毛病？第一、因为我们若干领导干部习惯于接受抽象的任务与抽象地布置工作，不习惯于从具体的组织工作中实现领导。任务包下来了，具体地组织群众去实现做的很差，特别是群众中先进分子的经验时常被忽视，或者只在口头上提一提，奖励一番，缺乏及时总结，加以推广，因此群众的生产积极性忽高忽低，或自生自灭，在前半年加班加点的现象是较多的，既浪费群众的积极性，又侵害群众的健康。一九五○年一月至十月根据极不完全的统计（个别局仅有三、四个月的数字），全国铁路公伤病假共计九九六、四八七人日，可见劳动力的浪费是很大的。第二、容易被表面的成绩所炫惑，忽略了前进过程中时时刻刻所发生的不牢靠、不巩固的东西。例如强调列车正点运行进步很快，但同时发生货物列车以限点改点来制造正点。强调省煤，机车就减少供给客车暖气。装车数与周转时间也同样有虚假情形。第三、以抢修旧线工程的经验从事新建工程，因此就忽略了设计、计划、组织工作的复杂过程，因而也就不会去进行核算成本，既造成人力、材料的浪费，又不能完成任务。
    总结起来，在领导方法上，存在着脱离实际的官僚主义作风。去年五月以后，经过半年来的整风，有了若干改进，并在继续改进中；但彻底改进作风，还是一个长期的继续斗争的过程。
    以上就是一九五○年全国铁路的工作情况。
            第二、一九五一年的方针和任务：
    根据中央财政经济的总方针和全国铁路目前的情况，我们认为一九五一年铁路工作方针应该是：继续开展抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育，更进一步发动群众性的创造新纪录运动；普遍建立经济核算思想，并重点实行；在业务上和线路上着重发挥人力，进行养路维修，完成运输任务；在新建线路上，继续勘测设计，有准备地重点施工；财务工作上，则要求努力增加收入，节省开支，严格实行预决算制度。
    根据上述方针，拟定一九五一年工作计划轮廓如下：
    （一）全国运输计划：
    货运总吨数较一九五○年增加百分之七点三五，总延吨公里较一九五○年增加百分之二十五点三，平均每日装车数增加百分之十。客运一亿五千一百余万人，总延人公里二百亿公里。货车周转时间全年总平均为三点三三天，较一九五○年缩短零点三九天，并消灭若干虚假周转数字。同时大量组织直达列车，加长周转距离。营业收入应较一九五○年增加百分之十。
    （二）基本建设计划（从略）。
    （三）加强成本计算，通过群众运动查定标准定额，建立基层单位的统计工作，以为全面实行经济核算制的准备，并在各局重点试行，拟在两年内在全国铁路实行经济核算制。
    （四）新建线路要加强准备工作，经过周密准备后再行开工。正在进行的新路工程，应加强组织领导。对一九五二年度的计划，应提早编制。
    （五）加强监察和稽核工作，普遍开展规程、条例、法令的学习，养成全路员工遵守的习惯，坚决执行劳动纪律和财政纪律。
    （六）继续开展抗美援朝爱国主义的生产竞赛，推行合理化建议、新纪录运动、模范机车队运动，贯彻负责制、合同制。准备在一九五一年协同全国铁路总工会召开铁路英雄模范大会，以便总结职工群众的创造经验，推广到全国铁路上，把全国铁路工作推进一步。
