　　Shanghai and Qingdao Basically Complete Labor Insurance Factory Enterprise Registration Work
    Tianjin Formulates Plan to Prepare for Implementation of Labor Insurance Regulations
    The application and registration work for public and private enterprises in Shanghai and Qingdao implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations has been basically completed. From March 1st to 15th, 703 units in Shanghai submitted registration applications to the Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, and 23 units are in the process of filling out applications. The Labor Bureau is now reviewing and approving the submitted applications separately. The application and registration work for public and private enterprises and factories in Qingdao implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations has also been completed. Excluding the railway and telecommunications industries, a total of 64 public and private factories and enterprises applied for registration, with nearly 40,000 employees. The Qingdao Branch of the People's Bank of China has decided to collect labor insurance funds paid by registered units starting from the 17th. The Qingdao Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have separately convened administrative and capitalist representatives of public and private enterprises, as well as grassroots trade union cadres, to make specific arrangements on how to keep, use, and allocate labor insurance funds. The labor insurance cadre training class, which started on the 12th of this month, is expected to end at the end of the month. After the end, the grassroots trade unions will establish labor insurance committees and start preparing for registration, statistics, and other work.
    Currently, trade unions in various factories are vigorously carrying out publicity and mobilization among employees. Employees of factories approved to implement the Labor Insurance Regulations are extremely excited. Employees of various textile factories under the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, Qilu Rubber Factory, private Huaxin Yarn Factory, Continental Tobacco Company, and other units held celebration meetings.

    The Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on the 15th, and adopted a plan for preparatory work for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China. Based on the experience of implementing the Tianjin Municipal Labor Insurance Regulations last year, the meeting decided that March 20th to 26th will be the city's Labor Insurance Propaganda Week. Last year, due to insufficient publicity to the broad masses of employees, many employees did not fully understand the role and significance of implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations, and some factories even abused labor insurance funds to run general welfare services for employees such as hairdressing and bathing. The meeting stipulated that during the propaganda week, trade unions at all levels should conduct publicity to the broad masses of employees through celebration meetings, symposiums, labor insurance lectures, recollection meetings, and the use of various forms of propaganda such as cartoons, radio, wall newspapers, blackboards, singing, clapper talks, limericks, slides, and movies, so that the broad masses of workers and cadres can understand the spirit and content of the Labor Insurance Regulations, so as to facilitate future implementation. In order to train cadres for the implementation of labor insurance, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has decided to open a labor insurance cadre training class, transferring and training about 500 administrative and trade union personnel in charge of labor insurance from various factories.
    The meeting also decided that units implementing labor insurance should quickly improve medical institutions, replenish medical equipment, and educate medical personnel.
    In addition, the meeting also discussed the various tasks of ending the implementation of the Tianjin Municipal Labor Insurance Regulations.

　　上海青岛实行劳动保险工厂企业
    登记工作初步结束
    天津拟定计划准备实施劳动保险条例
    上海、青岛两市实施劳动保险条例的公私营企业，申请登记工作已初步结束。上海市于三月一日到十五日中，有七百零三个单位将登记申请书送到市人民政府劳动局，有二十三个单位的申请书正在填写中。现劳动局正对已送到的申请书分别进行审查和批准。青岛市实施劳动保险条例的公私企业工厂的申请登记工作亦已完毕。除铁路、电信两产业系统外，申请登记的公私营工厂企业共六十四个单位，共有职工近四万人。中国人民银行青岛分行已决定自十七日起代收已登记单位所缴纳的劳动保险基金。青岛市劳动局及市总工会并对如何保管、动用支配劳动保险金等问题，分别召集了公私营企业的行政、资方代表以及基层工会干部作了具体布置。于本月十二日开学的劳动保险干部训练班，预计月底结束。结束后，基层工会即成立劳动保险委员会，着手办理登记、统计等准备工作。
    目前各厂工会正大力向职工进行宣传动员。被批准实施劳动保险条例的工厂职工，都兴奋异常。华东纺织管理局青岛分局所属各纺织厂、齐鲁橡胶厂、私营华新纱厂、大陆烟草公司等单位的职工都举行了庆祝大会。

    天津市总工会于十五日召开常务委员扩大会议，通过了实施中华人民共和国劳动保险条例的准备工作计划。根据去年实施天津市劳动保险条例的经验，会议决定本月二十日到二十六日为全市劳动保险宣传周。去年，因对广大职工群众的宣传不够深入，以致很多职工不完全了解实施劳动保险条例的作用和意义，某些工厂甚至滥用劳动保险金举办理发、洗澡等职工一般生活福利事业。会议规定在宣传周中，各级工会均应通过庆祝大会、座谈会、劳动保险讲座、回忆会及利用漫画、广播、墙报、黑板报、歌唱、快板、顺口溜、幻灯、电影等各式各样的宣传方式，向广大职工群众进行宣传，使广大工人和干部了解劳动保险条例的精神和内容，以利于以后的实施。为培养实行劳动保险的工作干部，市总工会已决定开办劳动保险干部训练班，调训五百名左右的各工厂行政和工会负责劳动保险的工作人员。
    会议并决定，实施劳动保险的单位应迅速地把医疗机构健全起来，充实医药器材，并对医务人员进行教育。
    此外，会议并讨论了结束实施天津市劳动保险条例的各项工作。
