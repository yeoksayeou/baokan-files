The French Communist Party had to go through a severe political struggle to become a true communist party. It should be emphasized that the struggle to win the united front was the first priority.

The Communist International called for the slogan of "Go to the masses!" and the establishment of a united front of the proletariat.

This call from the Communist International met with strong resistance from some party leaders, who insisted that it might be possible to use the united front strategy in other countries, but not in France.

Thus, two fundamentally different concepts arose within the party. One concept was to regard the party as a propaganda group, while the other was to turn the party into a fighting mass organization.

The united front policy was all the more necessary because the working class was not only politically divided, but also divided along trade union lines (due to the split of the French General Confederation of Labor by the Stone House in 1921).

Many party members did not understand the strategy of the united front. This lack of understanding was exacerbated by the fact that there were still enemies of the working class and enemies of communism within the party; they were later exposed.

While the party's leaders were being persecuted for declaring a fraternal alliance with the German proletariat and opposing the occupation of the Ruhr, Frossard and his followers withdrew from the party. They returned to social democracy. Even when they remained in the Communist Party, they were already mouthpieces and representatives of social democracy.

Our party bravely fought against the colonial policy during the war against Morocco. Thorez served as the chairman of the action committee that organized this struggle. Our party proved to the laborers that they must realize that their expectations and interests are opposed to the interests of their exploiters, and our party implemented the policy of "class against class."

Because the party wanted to make every effort to become a true communist party, a party of the working class, it transformed its organizational foundation in accordance with the experience of the Bolshevik Party.

Branches in various production departments were established. The 12th Party Congress held in April 1950 pointed out that these branches should work better and better explain the party's policies to the workers in the enterprises.

Thorez played a leading role in implementing the policy of rooting the party in the working masses. He exposed the Babu-Selo police group, which sabotaged the party's work and acted in concert with Doriot, who was later proven to have betrayed the party.

When the working classes of all countries deeply mourned the death of Lenin in January 1924, Thorez was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the party at the Lyon Party Congress. The following year, in July 1925, he was elected as a member of the Political Bureau and served as the secretary in charge of organizational issues.

After assuming a more important leadership position, Thorez devoted himself to building a truly new type of party inspired by the example and experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik).

It was difficult to resolutely make the Communists win over the masses because of the sabotage of enemies within the party who distorted the party's line.

In 1930, Thorez, as the general secretary, led the party and made a profound change in the party's policy.

He emphasized that "resolutely improving the attitude towards the working masses" is the only way to overcome the current difficulties.

He pointed out the danger of belittling the demands that are common or unique to a certain enterprise, and firmly emphasized the fact that the united front strategy was forgotten.

Thorez insisted that a struggle between two lines must be carried out: against the danger of opportunism and against the "left" leaning of sectarianism. He cleverly pointed out that these two views that distorted the party's line were caused by the same reason—the difficulties at the time—which on the one hand made some people try to evade responsibility, and on the other hand made some people loudly sing the high-pitched tune of revolution.

After becoming the leader of the French Communists and becoming an instructor who cultivated them in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, Thorez did not neglect the organizational issues of the party, the selection and training of cadres, the necessity of criticism and self-criticism, and revolutionary vigilance.

Thorez's goal was to establish "a new, combatant, revolutionary party, which has the courage to carry out the struggle for the proletariat to seize power; which has sufficient experience to understand the complexity of the revolutionary situation; and which is flexible enough to avoid all the reefs on the road of struggle."

In order to attract all party members and the working class to the cause of building a truly communist party, Thorez launched a persistent struggle to "abide by the principles of democratic centralism, oppose ideological ambiguity and castrating ideology." "There should be no walking corpses in the party! Let them speak freely!"

Our general secretary thus prepared the party to shoulder the arduous responsibility that fell on its shoulders when the fascists attempted to carry out a violent coup on February 6, 1934.

The leadership of the Socialist Party, headed by Blum and Frossard, adopted a hostile attitude towards the establishment of the united front. However, the Communist Party, which fought under the leadership of Thorez, widely implemented the policy of united action at the lower levels.

The working masses—Socialists and Communists—united in the face of the fascist danger. The leadership of the Socialist Party had to succumb to this desire for unity and signed a united action convention, thereby promoting the establishment of the later Popular Front.

When Dimitrov talked about this policy, he said: "The merit of the French Communist Party lies in the fact that it understands the work that needs to be done today, and does not listen to those sectarianists who hinder and obstruct the party from forming a united front in the anti-fascist struggle, but bravely, in the spirit of Bolshevism, concluded a joint action convention with the Socialist Party, created the united front of the proletariat, and made it the foundation of the anti-fascist Popular Front. Due to this action that is in line with the vital interests of all working masses, the French workers, Communists, and Socialists have re-led the movement of the French people to the leading position in capitalist Europe, showing that they are worthy of being the descendants of the Paris Commune, and worthy of being the keepers of the glorious precepts of the Paris Commune."

The French Communist Party, which has become a mass party, has begun to play a huge role in French life.

The French group of big capitalists placed their class interests above the interests of France and became supporters and accomplices of Hitler's rule, because they believed that Hitler's rule was a guarantee of their privileges. Thorez's central idea was that the working class must realize that the first place in the country belongs to and should belong to the working class, and that the propertied class should be abolished.

In this way, the French Communist Party, which grew up under the banner of proletarian internationalism and was consolidated in the struggle against chauvinism and colonial policy, as the vanguard of the working class, assumed the responsibility of defending the current and future interests of the country.

Thorez explained this great policy in his book "Son of the People" as follows:

"In my report, I stated: Communists are internationalists, but they are unashamedly proud of the great past of their country, proud of their great ancestors—the warriors of 1793, proud of the participants in the February and June events of 1848, and proud of the heroes of the Paris Commune.

"Communists are deeply grateful to all the peasants, proletarians, and intellectuals who have added glory to our motherland.

"Communists expose and fight against those who slander and turn French national culture towards degeneration. We are the legitimate heirs of the revolutionary ideas of the 18th-century encyclopedists, the legitimate heirs of the materialism of philosophers such as Diderot, Helvétius, and Feuerbach. We inherit the cause of those who fought at the forefront of mankind, while the increasingly decadent bourgeoisie praises the articles of aesthetes who are descendants of the dandies under the old regime.

"We fight for the unity of the French nation, against parasites and traitors. We seized the 'Marseillaise' from the hands of the descendants of the Koblenz exiles. The 'Marseillaise' is the heart of the French Revolution of 1792, the Jacobins and Girondins who rose up against the emperor and nobles of France. The 'Marseillaise' is the enthusiastic expression of the people's revolutionary will, high spirits, and heroism. It is the revolution itself."

Thorez sought to unite the broad masses of the people around this national salvation policy, and he often emphasized the important task of the Communist Party in implementing the cause of united action with the Socialist Party's laborers.

For example, when Thorez raised this basic issue again at the 12th Party Congress in Janville, he said:

"Socialist Party workers should join in common action. The Communists have never confused the right-wing Socialist Party leaders with the laborers of the Socialist Party. The Communists call on the laborers of the Socialist Party to rise up and fight against the enemies of the people together. The Communists pointed out that there is a significant consensus among the leaders of the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Party, and the Gaullists on all basic issues, especially on the issue of making France subordinate to the American imperialists; however, the Communists do not adopt Lassalle's fallacy about 'reactionary masses' in any occasion. We must also often deeply sympathize with the workers of the Socialist Party and strive to understand their mental state."

The policy of uniting the broad masses of the people implemented by Thorez was by no means only considering the laborers of the Socialist Party. He had repeatedly emphasized the importance of reaching out to Catholics when implementing the policy. Everyone should be reminded of how he clarified this policy when he delivered that widely responded speech in 1936:

"We reach out to you—Catholics (workers, staff, craftsmen, farmers); we, atheists, reach out to you, because you are our brothers and have the same concerns as us.

"We reach out to you—former front soldiers of the 'National Volunteers' and former members of the 'Fighting Cross Group'—because you are the sons of our people and suffer from chaos and corruption like us, because you, like us, want to prevent the collapse and demise of France.

"We are members of the great Communist Party. The Communist Party is a party of loyal and incorruptible revolutionary activists. Their names have never been associated with any speculative affairs, and it is impossible to be associated with any corruption. We are the defenders of the purest and most sublime ideals of mankind."

The question at that time was how to unite all the French people to oppose the increasingly rampant threat of fascism and to oppose Hitler and Mussolini who, with the help of Blum, attacked the Spanish Republic. The question at that time was how to isolate Hitler's spies scattered in France, the "Fifth Column."

Everyone knows that the French rulers, starting from the interests of their class, betrayed the interests of France, signed the shameful Munich Agreement, caused serious damage to the Franco-Soviet alliance, and carried out a "subtle war" that ended with Petain's surrender.

　　法国共产党的诞生和发展（中）
    法国共产党中央委员会书记 杜克洛
    法国共产党为了成为真正的共产主义政党，还要经过严酷的政治斗争。应当着重指出，其中首先是争取统一战线的斗争。
    共产国际号召实现“到群众中去！”的口号，并建立无产阶级的统一战线。
    共产国际的这一号召，遭到党若干领导者的强烈抵抗，他们硬说运用统一战线的策略在其他国家或许有可能，但在法国却是不可能的。
    这样，党内便发生了两种本质上完全不同的概念。一种概念是把党看作宣传团体，而另一种概念是要把党变成战斗的群众性的组织。
    由于工人阶级不仅在政治上是分裂的，而且在工会路线上也是分裂的（这是由于石屋在一九二一年进行了法国总工会的分裂），所以，统一战线政策就越发必要了。
    许多党员还不了解统一战线的策略。这种不了解因为有下面的情形而更加严重了，那就是党内还存在着工人阶级的敌人，共产主义的敌人；后来他们都被揭露了。
    正当党的领导人员因宣布和德国无产阶级结成兄弟联盟、反对占领鲁尔而遭受迫害的时候，福罗萨及其左右便退出了党。他们回到社会民主主义方面去了。甚至当他们留在共产党里面的时候，他们就已当了社会民主主义的传声筒和代表了。
    我们的党在反对摩洛哥战争时曾勇敢地进行了反殖民政策的斗争。多列士曾任组织这种斗争的行动委员会的主席。我们的党向劳动者证明必须意识到他们的期望和利益是与他们的剥削者的利益对立的，我们的党实行“阶级反对阶级”的政策。
    党因为要以全力使自己成为真正的共产主义的党、工人阶级的党，便依照布尔什维克党的经验改造了自己的组织基础。
    各生产部门的支部建立起来了。一九五○年四月举行的党第十二次代表大会曾经指出：这些支部应该更好地工作，更好地向各企业中的工人解释党的政策。
    多列士在实行使党在工人群众中生根的政策上起了头等作用。他揭露了巴布——塞洛警察集团；这一集团破坏党的工作，并与后来证明已背叛的多里欧一致行动。
    在一九二四年一月各国工人阶级深深哀悼列宁逝世的时候，多列士在里昂党代表大会上被选为党的中央委员。次年，一九二五年七月，他被选为政治局的委员，并担任负责组织问题的书记。
    多列士担任了更重要的领导职务后，便致力于建立一个受苏联共产党（布）的榜样和经验鼓舞着的真正新型的党。
              ×                ×                ×
    由于党内有歪曲了党的路线的敌人进行破坏工作，结果就难以坚决地使共产党人争取群众。
    一九三○年，多列士以总书记的身份领导党，使党的政策有了深刻的改变。
    他着重指出：“坚决改善对工人群众的态度”，乃是克服当前困难的唯一方法。
    他指出轻视一定企业所共有或特有的要求会有怎样的危险，并坚定不移地着重指出所谓忘却统一战线策略的这一事实。
    多列士力主必须进行两条路线的斗争：反对机会主义的危险和反对宗派主义的“左”倾。他很巧妙地指出：这两种歪曲党的路线的观点，都是由同一原因——当时的困难——产生的，这些困难一方面使某些人企图逃避责任，而另一方面则使一些人大唱革命的高调。
    多列士在成为法国共产党人的领导者，成为以马克思列宁主义精神培育他们的教导者以后，丝毫也没有忽视党的组织问题，没有忽视干部的选拔和培养、批评与自我批评的必要和革命的警觉性。
    多列士的目的，是建立“新的、战斗的、革命的党，这个党要有充分的勇气，足以进行无产阶级夺取政权的斗争；要有充分的经验，足以了解革命形势的复杂情况；而且要非常灵活，足以在斗争的道路上避开所有一切的暗礁。”
    多列士因为要把全体党员和工人阶级吸引到建立真正共产主义的党的事业中来，便展开了“遵守民主集中制的原则、反对思想含糊和阉割思想”的坚持不渝的斗争。“党内不应有行尸走肉！让他们无拘无束地说话吧！”
    我们的总书记就这样使党有所准备，以便担当在一九三四年二月六日法西斯分子企图实行暴力政变时落在自己肩上的艰巨责任。
    以勃鲁姆和福罗为首的社会党领导机构，对建立统一战线采取敌对态度，可是，在多列士领导下进行斗争的共产党，却在下层广泛地执行了统一行动的政策。
    劳动群众——社会党人和共产党人——在法西斯危险的面前团结起来了。社会党领导机构不得不屈服于这一盼望统一的渴求，而签订了统一行动公约，从而促进了后来人民阵线的建立。
    季米特洛夫在谈到这一政策时曾经说过：“法国共产党的功绩，就在于它了解今天所需要做的工作，不听从那些牵掣并阻挠该党在反法西斯斗争中组成统一战线的宗派主义者，却勇敢地本着布尔什维克的精神，和社会党缔订了共同行动公约，创建了无产阶级的统一战线，使它成为反法西斯人民阵线的基础。由于这个符合一切劳动群众切身利益的行动，法国工人、共产党人、社会党人，便把法国人民的运动重新引到资本主义欧洲的首要主导地位，表明他们不愧为巴黎公社的后裔，不愧为巴黎公社光荣箴规的保持者。”
            ×                ×                    ×
    已成为群众性政党的法国共产党，在法国的生活中开始起着巨大的作用。
    法国大资本家集团把自己的阶级利益置于法国的利益之上，作了希特勒统治的拥护者和帮凶，因为他们认为希特勒的统治是自己特权的保障。多列士的中心思想，就在于必须使工人阶级觉悟到国家中的第一位将属于而且也应该属于工人阶级，觉悟到要废除有产阶级。
    这样，在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下成长起来，在反对沙文主义与殖民政策的斗争中巩固起来的法国共产党，作为工人阶级的先锋队，便担负起了保卫国家现在的利益和将来的利益的责任。
    多列士在《人民的儿子》一书中对这个伟大的政策作了如下的阐明：
    “在我的报告中，我曾声明：共产党人是国际主义者，但他们毫无愧色地以自己国家伟大的过去而自豪，以自己伟大的祖先——一七九三年的战士而自豪，以一八四八年二月和六月事件的参加者而自豪，以巴黎公社的英雄们而自豪。
    “共产党人对于为我们祖国增光的一切农民、无产者、知识分子怀着深挚的感谢。
    “共产党人揭露了诽谤法国的民族文化并把它折向堕落的那种人，而且和他们斗争。我们是十八世纪百科全书派革命思想的合法继承者，是狄德罗、海尔维茨亚、费尔巴哈等哲学的唯物论的合法继承者。我们继承着那些站在人类最前列进行斗争的人们的事业，而日趋堕落的资产阶级却颂扬旧政体下的纨袴子弟的后裔——唯美主义者的文章。
    “我们为争取法国民族的团结、反对寄生者和奸贼而奋斗。我们从科不林士流亡者的徒子徒孙的手中夺取了《马赛曲》。《马赛曲》是一七九二年革命的法国，起义反对帝王和贵族的雅可宾派及济龙德派的法国内心深处的流露。《马赛曲》是人民革命的意志、高昂的情绪和英雄主义的热烈的表现，它就是革命的本身。”
    多列士力求把广大人民群众团结在这种民族救亡政策的周围，他经常强调共产党在实行与社会党劳动者统一行动的事业上所担当的重大任务。
    例如多列士在让维勒第十二次党代表大会上再度提起这一基本问题时说：
    “社会党工人应该加入共同行动。共产党人从来没有把右翼社会党领导人和社会党的劳动者混淆起来，共产党人号召社会党的劳动者起来共同反对人民的敌人。共产党人指出：在社会党、人民共和党以及戴高乐派的领导人之间，对一切基本问题，首先是对使法国隶属于美帝国主义者的问题，存在着显著的一致；但是，共产党人在任何场合也不采取拉萨尔主义者关于“反动群众”的谬论。我们也要经常对社会党工人深深同情，并力求了解他们的精神状态。”
    多列士所实行的团结人民大众的政策，决不是仅仅考虑到社会党劳动者的。他曾经不止一次地强调实行政策时向天主教徒伸手的重要性。应该提醒大家注意他在一九三六年发表那得到广泛响应的演说时是怎样阐明这一政策的：
    “我们向你们——天主教徒们（工人、职员、手工业者、农民）伸手；我们，无神论者，向你们伸手，因为你们是我们的兄弟，并且有着和我们一样的挂虑。
    “我们向你们——‘民族义勇军’、曾为‘战斗十字团’团员的过去的前方将士——伸手，因为你们是我们人民的儿子，而且和我们一样遭受着混乱和腐败的痛苦，因为你们也和我们一样想要防止法国的崩溃和灭亡。
    “我们是伟大共产党的党员、共产党是忠诚而廉洁的革命活动家的党，他们的名字从来就和任何投机情事无关，而且不可能与任何腐败的事有关。我们是人类最纯洁、最崇高的理想的保卫者。”
    那时的问题，是如何团结全体法国人民来反对日益嚣张的法西斯主义的威胁，反对在勃鲁姆协助之下进攻了西班牙共和国的希特勒和墨索里尼。那时的问题，是如何孤立希特勒散布在法国的奸细“第五纵队”。
    大家都知道，法国统治者从自己阶级的利益出发，叛卖了法国的利益，签订了可耻的慕尼黑协定，使法苏联盟遭受严重的打击，并进行了以贝当投降作收场的“微妙的战争”。
