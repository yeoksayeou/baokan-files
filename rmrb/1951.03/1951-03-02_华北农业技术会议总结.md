　　Summary of the North China Agricultural Technology Conference

　　Editor's Note: The North China Agricultural Technology Conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the North China Affairs Department from January 23rd to February 2nd. More than 220 people attended. Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng and Minister of the North China Affairs Department Liu Lantao attended and spoke, clearly pointing out the significance of carrying out the agricultural production movement in the current situation. At the meeting, production experts Liang Jiarui, Guo Yu'en, and others reported their "secrets" for producing more grain, which they had always believed in; technical experts Zhu Hongfu, Huang Ruilun, Cai Xu, and others presented their research reports combined with the actual situation in rural areas for discussion, and believed that raising the production experience of experienced farmers to a scientific level was the current specific task. At the same time, they unanimously expressed their support for the call made by the conference to launch a mass movement to improve agricultural technology. Zhang Linchi, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Agriculture, made a summary report of the conference. The full text of the report is as follows:

　　Part One: Achievements and Experiences of 1950

　　With the completion of land reform in North China, the liberation of productive forces, victory in the war, and a stable environment, coupled with the implementation and implementation of various policies, the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for production has been unprecedentedly high. The region's agricultural production has reached or is close to the pre-war level. If technology is not improved, it will be difficult to further increase production. In addition, various natural disasters occur year after year. In the previous year, disaster caused a reduction of about 5 billion catties (of raw grain), and last year, the reduction due to disaster was almost equal to the total amount of public grain. Therefore, improving technology to prevent and eliminate disasters has become an urgent demand of the vast number of farmers in North China. In 1950, North China provinces achieved great success in improving agricultural production technology; a mass movement was formed, the inherent excellent experience of farmers was promoted, many scientific technologies suitable for the needs of the masses were popularized, and the great creativity of the masses was demonstrated.

　　1.  A tremendous struggle was waged against diseases, insect pests, and natural disasters. The basic principle of "prevention is more important than cure" was implemented. The masses were organized to carry out seed disinfection, winter plowing, gleaning, weeding, digging up insect eggs, seed selection, and catching, beating, and burning. For example, in Chahar Province, 60% of households carried out seed soaking and mixing. A large-scale movement to glean was launched during autumn plowing. In Chahar South alone, 110,000 people were mobilized, collecting 1.44 million catties of gleanings, greatly reducing the damage caused by millet borers. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, 210,000 mu of weeds were removed from the fields to prevent and control cotton aphids. More than 50,000 sprayers and 900,000 catties of pesticides were distributed throughout the region, mobilizing and organizing 8.37 million people, with a prevention and control area of approximately 25 million mu. It is estimated that grain loss was reduced by about 500 million catties alone.

　　2.  A mass seed selection competition was launched, and a large number of high-yielding, high-quality, and disease-resistant fine varieties were selected, such as Xuzhou 438 and Pingyuan 50 wheat. In the summer and autumn seasons, the five provinces of North China popularized a total of 24.71 million catties of fine grain varieties, which can be sown on an area of 3.25 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 41%. The masses selected approximately 100 million catties of seeds, which can be sown on more than 20 million mu, which can increase production by approximately 300 million catties in 1951. 1.5 million catties of fine cotton varieties were popularized, and 1.8 million mu were sown, accounting for 10% of the cotton field area; the average yield per mu increased by 10 to 20 catties. Based on 10 catties alone, 180,000 dan of seed cotton can be increased. During the autumn harvest, in addition to the self-retained seeds by the masses in the popularization area, 26.83 million catties of fine cotton varieties were selected and collected, which can increase the production of 330,000 dan of seed cotton in 1951.

　　3.  There has also been a great improvement in cultivation techniques, and many high-yield models have emerged. For example, cotton cultivation is more meticulous than in previous years. Generally, four to six times of intertillage and weeding have been carried out. A series of technologies such as fertilization, pruning, and seed selection have been gradually improved. As a result, the average yield per mu in Hebei has increased by 5 to 6 catties of ginned cotton compared with 1949. Liuying Village in Shijiazhuang Prefecture produced an average of 293 catties of seed cotton per mu for the entire village. Liang Jiarui's six mu of paddy fields yielded an average of 480 catties of seed cotton per mu. Zhou Shun's dry land in Linqing yielded 450 catties of seed cotton per mu (before the war, the average yield per mu in North China was 90 catties). In terms of food crops, many farmers have greatly increased the yield per unit area by improving cultivation techniques. Guo Jiaxiang in Xushui, Hebei, produced 900 catties of millet per mu (before the war, the average yield per mu in North China was 160 catties), Ma Guorong in Changli produced 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes per mu, Wang Xihe in Nanwang, Pingyuan, produced 900 catties of wheat per mu (before the war, the average yield per mu in North China was 100 catties), Yang Jianshan produced 800 catties of millet per mu, and Guo Yu'en's mutual aid group in Pingshun, Shanxi, combined with the improvement of technology, made the yield per mu in the entire village exceed 7.5 dou before the war. The emergence of a large number of high-yield experts has further increased the demand and confidence of the vast number of farmers in improving cultivation techniques and increasing production.

　　4.  Over the past year, many disease-resistant and high-yielding varieties have been tested and researched. Some rust-resistant varieties have been selected for wheat, some of which can be propagated immediately, and some of which can be determined within two or three years. The newly bred spring wheat varieties are of good quality, early-maturing, disease-resistant, and high-yielding, and have shown superiority in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi. The newly bred Pingmian No. 3 and No. 1 for cotton are suitable for planting in Tangshan and north of Baoding, and Fu 57-15 is suitable for planting in the north and south of Shijiazhuang, with better quality and yield than S cotton. In terms of miscellaneous grains, China Agricultural No. 4 has become a high-yield variety of millet, and Border Area No. 1 is early-maturing, high-yielding, and has a very wide adaptability. In terms of disease and insect pest control, cotton aphid parasitism was discovered, a safe cotton oil emulsion was developed, a method for identifying white hair disease seedlings was found from the experience of the masses, lime emulsion was used to soak seeds to prevent and control millet black smut disease, especially peanut rhizobia seed mixing is less labor-intensive and more effective. More than 50,000 mu were mixed this year, increasing the yield by 700,000 catties of peanut kernels. In addition, there have been many achievements in soil improvement, livestock breeding, and the popularization of new agricultural tools.

　　The main reasons and experiences for achieving the above results are as follows:

　　1.  The basic direction of technology serving the people and the combination of agricultural scientific theory and the production experience of the vast number of farmers has been implemented. Many leading organs and rural cadres have realized that they cannot lead farmers' production without understanding technology. Therefore, they actively requested to open training classes to learn the technology that the masses urgently need. Last year, Hebei trained 26,000 cadres, Chahar 57,000, and Shanxi trained more than 10,000 in the spring alone. Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan trained about 400,000 cadres, representatives from all walks of life, and the masses. In addition, the region added more than 500 agricultural technicians and a large number of newly graduated students; the vast number of agricultural technicians went deep into the countryside to help farmers and also received training themselves. Through the leadership and help of these cadres, model experts have organized a large number of technical committees, technical groups, and established many small farmers' farms (more than 2,000 in Anyang Prefecture), and organized a large number of small-scale exhibitions. This has turned the improvement of technology into a broad mass movement. However, some people still cannot proceed from reality, and some people still despise technology. Therefore, the scientific sorting and improvement of farmers' production experience and then popularizing it to farmers is not done well enough. Some experimental sites still blindly conduct experiments regardless of the current needs of the masses. These biases must be corrected.

　　2.  The combination of technological improvement and organization not only enriched the content of organization and consolidated and improved mutual aid groups, but also made the improvement of technology more smooth and rapid. Because organization and collective production can save labor, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, brainstorm ideas, exchange experiences, give play to the creativity of each member, and easily accept the guidance of science and technology, such as the construction of water conservancy projects, the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and the use of new agricultural tools, which far exceeds the individual farming of farmers. This is the superiority of organization.

　　3.  The appraisal movement is the mass line for improving technology. It can bring together the production wisdom of the vast number of farmers to summarize their production achievements, stimulate farmers' interest in improving technology, and encourage farmers' confidence in increasing production. The appraisal movement is a mass production inspection and mutual teaching and learning among the masses in agricultural technology. In the appraisal movement, comparisons were widely carried out in technology, insect extermination struggle, seed selection and soaking, fertilization, and cultivation. Through these comparisons, the masses deeply realized that to obtain a bumper harvest, it is not only necessary to have plenty of manure and water, but also to further pay attention to technology.

　　4.  The efforts of agricultural farms and experimental research and promotion institutions at all levels. In 1950, the number of provincial, prefectural, and county farms increased from 217 to 313. Most farms and other specialized institutions began to understand the importance of combining research and experimentation with the production experience of the vast number of farmers. Some have actually combined and made preliminary achievements. In terms of demonstration, many farms have paid attention to the combination of cultivation technology and the application of fine varieties, thus achieving high yields. According to the statistics of the prefectural and county farms attending the meeting, the cotton harvest generally exceeded the masses by 50% to 80%, and the grain exceeded by 40% to 60%. Handan Farm harvested 608 catties of seed cotton per mu, creating a new record for cotton yield per unit area in the country. Shijiazhuang Farm guided Beidu Village to improve technology, increasing the village's production by 500,000 catties, thus enhancing the farm's prestige among the masses. However, some farms are either poorly managed or have a tendency to operate purely, which greatly hinders the close relationship between the farm and the local masses and the development of farm work, which must be corrected.

　　Part Two: Tasks for Improving Agricultural Technology in 1951

　　The agricultural production task in North China in 1951 is to restore and exceed the pre-war production level, requiring an average increase of 10% per mu. To this end, in addition to correctly implementing policies and organizing, it is necessary to launch a mass movement to improve technology to ensure the completion of the production increase task. In terms of improving technology, water conservancy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, agricultural tools and fertilizers have been or will be discussed at meetings. This meeting discussed and resolved the following issues, which are the main tasks for improving agricultural technology in 1951.

　　1.  Prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Continue to implement the basic principle of "prevention is more important than cure." Organize the masses to carry out seed disinfection, field seed selection, improved cultivation methods, launch autumn plowing movement, weeding movement, mining insect egg masses, and complete various preparations for disease and insect pest prevention and control before spring plowing in a timely manner. Once insect pests occur, immediately organize catching and killing to prevent spreading, and ensure that several serious diseases and insect pests, such as cotton aphids, locusts, armyworms, underground pests, wheat black smut, and millet white hair disease, do not cause disasters. The method of eliminating diseases and insect pests should still focus on organizing the masses to catch, beat, and burn. The promotion of scientific drugs and machinery should first focus on cotton, specialty orchards, and vegetable areas. Insufficient research has been done on domestic pesticides in the past, and attention must be paid to development and promotion in the future.

　　(1) In cotton-producing areas, weeds should be cleared and destroyed before sowing. Once cotton aphids occur, the masses should be immediately organized to continuously eliminate them. For the prevention and control of red spiders, it is necessary to keep abreast of information and establish a field inspection system. Once discovered, they should be immediately eliminated to prevent spreading. The main agents are the promotion of cotton oil soap, cotton oil emulsion, tobacco water, lime sulfur mixture, and other effective agents.

　　(2) In addition to calling for catching and killing, the masses should be organized to purchase red arsenic and sodium fluorosilicate for the prevention and control of underground insect pests. These pesticides should be prepared before sowing in spring and autumn.

　　(3) For locusts and armyworms, the current emphasis should be on organizing the masses to catch, beat, and collect eggs. After the occurrence, they should be immediately eliminated to prevent them from causing disasters. In sparsely populated areas, key points should be selected in a planned way to use 666 to kill locusts.

　　(4) For other insect pests, such as twenty-eight-spotted ladybugs, millet borers, grubs, rape worms, flea beetles, fruit worms, and vegetable worms, prevention and control should be carried out based on the successful experiences already available in various places.

　　(5) In terms of diseases, focus on preventing and controlling wheat black smut and millet white hair disease, and strengthen research on wheat yellow rust disease. Drug seed mixing and warm water immersion should be popularized or focused on popularization in different regions, and help farmers purchase thermometers (one in each village is sufficient) to accurately grasp the seed soaking temperature.

　　2.  Improve cultivation techniques. Advocate deep plowing and fine harrowing, and strive to achieve three plowing and four harrowing in areas with conditions. Improve fertilizer quality and study fertilization techniques. Advocate appropriately widening row spacing and shortening plant spacing on the existing basis to improve intertillage methods.

　　(1) Wheat: In order to achieve the goal of increasing wheat production in 1951, special attention should be paid to topdressing, irrigation, and weeding in spring. The introduction of winter wheat in Chahar and Suiyuan is still in the experimental stage and should be treated with special caution. We must actively study cultivation techniques and introduce excellent wheat varieties.

　　(2) Cotton: We should vigorously promote: (1) deep plowing in autumn, fine harrowing in early spring, careful selection of seeds, seed soaking and early thinning, dense seedlings, and late settling of seedlings to ensure that there are no missing seedlings in cotton fields; if there is a drought, vigorously launch drought-resistant sowing. (2) American cotton should widen row spacing, implement intertillage and soil cultivation, and adjust plant spacing according to soil fertility. (3) Break the erroneous view that cotton fields cannot be fertilized too much and cannot be topdressed. We should guide the masses to apply more base fertilizer and early topdressing. (4) On the basis of careful cultivation and fertilization, American cotton must be appropriately pruned.

　　(3) Miscellaneous grains: Millet is a high-yielding crop suitable for arid areas in North China. In addition to widening row spacing and concentrated fertilization (strip application), special attention should be paid to weeding and intertillage. Weeding should be done early, and intertillage should be done three or four times. For corn, the masses should be mobilized to select seeds and organize intervarietal hybridization. Sweet potato Nonglin No. 4 and Victory No. 100 can be planted without turning vines. High ridge cultivation should be promoted in paddy fields and areas with more autumn rain.

　　(4) Alkaline land is very large in North China, and farmers have created many cultivation techniques for improving alkaline land, which should be promoted. In Chahar and Suiyuan, where the land is vast and sparsely populated, and the soil is barren and lacks fertilizer, attention should be paid to the rational use of land, such as crop rotation and fallowing, to cultivate soil fertility and increase yields. In areas prone to water and drought disasters, attention should be paid to promoting the cultivation techniques of drought resistance and flood prevention among the masses.

　　3.  Popularize fine varieties. Launch a seed selection movement in summer and autumn, and widely mobilize the masses to select seeds, exchange seeds, and retain seeds. Generally, seeds should not be transferred over long distances, and the selection of fine varieties of various major crops should be completed in stages within five years. Each province should formulate plans according to specific circumstances. In seed selection, special attention should be paid to wheat rust resistance seed selection. Through comparison, not only should the excellent varieties be compared, but also the best techniques should be compared, so that the seed selection movement is closely combined with cultivation techniques.

　　Implement the fine grain and cotton seed breeding system: In terms of grain, take the prefecture and county farms as the center to organize a breeding and promotion network, and widely develop farmers' small farms and seed retention land, and establish fine seed breeding areas according to the needs of fine seed evaluation and promotion. Except for corn and vegetable seeds, which need to be isolated for breeding, the remaining crops do not need to be centrally bred. In water and drought disaster areas, attention should be paid to the planned transfer and promotion of early-maturing and disaster-resistant seeds. In terms of cotton, a fine seed breeding area should be established for centralized breeding, centralized promotion by region, and avoid mixing. Hebei and Pingyuan promote the varieties S cotton 2B and No. 4, and strive to popularize them on the existing basis. Jin Southwest promotes S cotton No. 4. Other regions promote Jinzi cotton. In areas where it has not been promoted, it is required to strengthen seed selection and improve it on the original basis.

　　4.  Experimental research work. Experimental research work is an important link in improving technology, but it must be studied in combination with the production experience of the vast number of people. It is opposed to only conducting closed-door experiments without combining with the masses. The main experimental research projects in 1951 are: wheat yellow rust, spring wheat stem rust, cotton and wheat vernalization application, cotton boll shedding, corn intervarietal hybridization, cultivation, farm manure making, fertilization, sweet potato rot disease, potato late blight and toxin disease, cotton, wheat, miscellaneous grains, kenaf selection and breeding experiments, etc., but do not be greedy for more and give up halfway. There must be a beginning and an end. The experimental research methods should be carried out in accordance with the decisions of the 1950 agricultural technology conference, "Selection and breeding test methods," "Variety comparison test methods," and "Corn improvement methods" for hybrid breeding. The materials must be selected according to the purpose, and the methods should be separated from the second generation, that is, single ear or single plant breeding, and the superior should be selected and the inferior should be eliminated year by year.

　　In order to ensure the successful completion of the above tasks, we must strengthen organizational leadership and launch a mass movement to improve agricultural technology.

　　First, all rural workers must attach importance to technology, regard leading farmers to improve technology as an important task, strengthen the study of agricultural technology, and all agricultural technicians must go deep into the masses, understand the actual situation of farmers, and combine theory with practice.

　　Second, we must strengthen the publicity and education of agricultural technology, and open short-term training classes and rotational training classes in a planned way so that county, district, and village cadres can receive technical training within three years. Compile and print popular agricultural science reading materials to improve the technical knowledge of rural cadres. Increase agricultural vocational schools and special training classes to train a large number of junior agricultural technical talents, and cooperate with education departments to run agricultural schools to train higher agricultural technicians to enrich farms and agricultural institutions.

　　Third, we must strengthen the leadership of agricultural administrative departments at all levels over farms and specialized institutions at all levels. Under their unified leadership, they should divide their work and cooperate, each with its own responsibilities. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and provincial farms are responsible for breeding and other more advanced experiments. The task of prefectural farms is to breed fine varieties and conduct cultivation experiments, and conduct variety comparison and regional experiments under the unified plan of higher-level farms. The main tasks of county farms are demonstration, breeding and promotion, and to conduct observation and comparison experiments conditionally.

　　Fourth, in order to exchange mass experience and promote mass creation, we must develop farmers' technical organizations in a planned way, such as technical committees, technical groups, small farms, etc., and strengthen their leadership and help.

　　Fifth, promote the experience of combining technology improvement with organization, launch a high-yield competition movement, and promote the wider development of technology improvement through rewarding labor models and appraisal movements.

　　华北农业技术会议总结
    编者按：华北农业技术会议，是一月二十三日至二月二日，由中央人民政府农业部和华北事务部联合召开的。出席者二百二十余人。农业部李书城部长和华北事务部刘澜涛部长，曾先后出席讲话，明确地指出了在当前形势下开展农业生产运动的意义。会上，生产能手梁家瑞、郭玉恩等都将自己一向认为多打粮食的“秘诀”作了报告；技术专家朱弘复、黄瑞纶、蔡旭等都将他们结合农村实际情况的研究报告，提出讨论，并认为把老农生产经验提高到科学水平，是当前的具体任务。同时一致对大会所提出的开展群众性提高农业技术运动的号召，表示拥护与支持。会议由农业部办公厅主任张林池作总结报告。报告全文如下：
            第一部分：一九五○年的成绩与经验
    华北土地改革完成，生产力解放，战争胜利，环境安定，加之各种政策的推行与贯彻，广大农民生产情绪空前高涨，全区农业生产已达到或接近战前水平，如不改进技术，则很难进一步的提高产量。加之各种自然灾害连年发生，前年因灾减产约五十亿斤（原粮），去年因灾减产几等于公粮的全部数字。因此改进技术防除灾害，便成为华北广大农民的迫切要求。一九五○年华北各省在改进农业生产技术上获得了很大成绩；形成了群众运动，发扬了农民固有的优良经验，推广了许多适合群众需要的科学技术，并表现了群众的伟大创造。
    一、向病虫灾害作了巨大的斗争。贯彻了“防重于治”的基本方针。组织群众进行了种籽消毒、冬耕、拾谷茬、锄草、挖虫卵、选种以及捕打烧杀等工作，如察哈尔省有百分之六十的户进行了浸种、拌种，在秋耕中发动大规模拾谷茬运动，仅察南十一县就发动十一万多人，拾谷茬一四四万斤，使粟螟为害大大减轻。石家庄专区为了防治棉蚜拔除田间杂草二一万亩。全区推广了喷雾器五万余架，农药九十余万斤，发动与组织了八三七万人，防治面积约达二千五百余万亩，估计仅减少粮食损失约五亿斤。
    二、开展了群众性的选种竞赛，选出了大批丰产、质优、抗病害力强的优良品种。如徐州四三八，平原五○麦等。夏秋两季华北五省共推广粮食良种二、四七一万斤，可播种面积三二五万亩。超过原计划百分之四十一。群众选种约一亿斤，能播种二千余万亩，可使一九五一年增产三亿斤左右。推广棉花良种一、五○○万斤，播种了一八○万亩，占棉田面积百分之十；平均每亩增收十斤至二十斤，仅以十斤计，即可增产籽棉十八万担。秋收时除在推广区群众自留种外，又选收了棉花良种二、六八三万斤，可使一九五一年增产籽棉三三万担。
    三、在耕作技术上，也有很大的提高，涌现出不少的丰产典型。如棉花栽培均比往年细致，中耕锄草一般做到了四至六次，施肥、整枝打杈、选种等一系列技术，均逐步提高，因而河北每亩平均较一九四九年增产皮棉五到六斤。石家庄留营村全村每亩平均产籽棉二九三斤。梁家瑞六亩水地，平均每亩收籽棉四八○斤。临清周顺旱地每亩收籽棉四五○斤（战前华北每亩平均产籽棉九十斤）。在粮食作物方面，不少农户因为改进了耕作技术，大大提高了单位面积的产量，河北徐水郭家祥每亩谷子产九百斤（战前华北每亩平均产一六○斤），昌黎马国荣每亩甘薯产一万斤，平原南旺王希河每亩小麦产九百斤（战前华北每亩平均产一百斤），杨见善每亩谷子产八百斤，山西平顺郭玉恩的互助组与提高技术相结合，使全村每亩产量超过战前七斗五升。由于出现了大批的丰产能手，更提高了广大农民改进耕作技术的要求与增产的信心。
    四、一年来试验研究出不少抗病丰产的品种。在小麦上选出了一些抗锈品种，有的即可繁殖，有的二、三年内即可决定，新育成的春麦品种，质优、早熟、耐病、产量大，在察、绥、晋都有优越表现。在棉花上新育出的平棉三号、一号，适于在唐山及保定以北种植，富５７—１５在石家庄南北地区种植，品质、产量均优于斯字棉。在杂粮上华农四号成为大谷丰产品种，边区一号早熟丰产，且适应性极广。在病虫害防治上发现了棉蚜寄生，制出安全棉油乳剂，从群众经验中找出了白发病幼苗鉴定法，用石灰乳浸种防治谷子黑穗病，特别是花生根瘤菌拌种费力小而收效大，今年拌了五万多亩，即增产七十万斤花生仁。此外，在改良土壤，繁殖牲畜，推广新农具等技术上，亦有不少成就。
    获得上述成绩的原因和经验主要的有以下几点：
    一、基本上贯彻了技术为人民服务，农业科学理论与广大农民生产经验相结合的方向。不少领导机关和农村干部已经体会到，不懂技术就不能领导农民生产的道理。因而积极要求开办训练班，学习当前群众迫切要求的技术。去年河北训练干部二万六千人，察哈尔五万七千人，山西仅春季训练即达万余人，平原安阳专区训练干部、各界代表和群众约四十万人。另全区增加了五百多农业技术人员和大批新毕业的学生；广大农业技术人员深入农村，帮助了农民，自己也得到了锻炼。通过这些干部的领导与帮助，模范能手们大量地组织了技术委员会、技术小组，建立了许多农民的小农场（安阳专区有两千多个），组织了大量的小型展览会。这就把提高技术形成了广大的群众运动。但是有些人还不能从实际出发，有些人还轻视技术，因而对农民生产经验加以科学的整理提高，再向农民去推广便做得很不够。某些试验场所，仍有不顾群众的当前需要，盲目地进行试验。这些偏向均须加以纠正。
    二、改进技术与组织起来相结合，不但充实了组织起来的内容，使互助组得到巩固与提高，而且使提高技术得到更顺利、更迅速的开展。因为组织起来，集体生产，可以节省劳力，取长补短，集思广益，交流经验，发挥每个组员的创造性，并容易接受科学技术的指导，如兴修水利、防治病虫害、使用新式农具等，均远超过单独耕作的农民，这就是组织起来的优越性。
    三、评比运动是提高技术的群众路线，它可以荟萃广大农民的生产智慧，以总结其生产成果；激发农民提高技术的兴趣，鼓励农民增产的信心。评比运动是群众性的生产大检查，是群众在农业技术上的互教互学。在评比运动中普遍进行了比技术、比灭虫斗争、比选种浸种、比施肥、比耕作等，经过这些比较，使群众深刻体会到要获得丰产，不仅要粪大水勤，还要进一步讲求技术。
    四、各级农场及试验研究推广机构的努力。一九五○年省、专、县农场由二一七个发展到三一三个，多数农场及其他专业机构，开始懂得研究试验必须与广大农民生产经验相结合的重要性，有些已实际结合起来，并做出初步成绩。在示范作用上，许多农场注意了栽培技术和应用良种相结合，因而获得了丰产。据到会的各专县农场统计，棉花收成一般超过群众百分之五十到八十，粮食超过百分之四十到六十。邯郸农场每亩收籽棉六零八斤，首创全国棉花单位面积产量的新纪录。石家庄农场指导北杜村改进技术，使全村增产五十万斤，因而提高了农场在群众中的威信。但也有若干农场不是经营管理的不好，便是存在着单纯经营的偏向，对密切农场与当地群众的关系和农场工作的开展，有极大妨害，必须纠正。
            第二部分：一九五一年改进农业技术的任务
    一九五一年华北的农业生产任务是恢复并超过战前生产水平，要求平均每亩提高一成。为此除正确贯彻政策和组织起来以外，必须开展群众性的提高技术运动，以保障增产任务的完成。在提高技术工作上，水利、畜牧兽医、农具肥料等已召开或将召开会议讨论，此次会议讨论解决了如下几个问题，也就是一九五一年提高农业技术的主要任务。
    一、防治病虫害。继续贯彻“防重于治”的基本方针。组织群众进行种子消毒，田间选种，改良耕作方法，开展秋耕运动，除草运动，采掘害虫卵块，并在春耕以前，及时完成防治病虫害的各种准备工作，虫害一旦发生立即组织捕打，严防蔓延，保证棉蚜、蝗虫、行军虫、地下害虫及小麦黑穗病、谷子白发病等几种为害严重的病虫害，不致成灾。消灭病虫害的办法，目前仍应以组织群众捕打烧杀为主。推行科学药械，首先应集中于棉花特产果园和蔬菜区。过去对国产农药研究不够，今后必须注意发展与推广。
    １、在棉产区于播种前，普遍进行清除并销毁杂草。棉蚜一旦发生，立即组织群众连续扑灭。对防治红蜘蛛，要随时掌握情报，建立田间检查制度，一经发现立即除治，严防蔓延。药剂主要是推广棉油皂、棉油乳剂、烟草水、石灰硫磺合剂及其他有效药剂。
    ２、对地下虫害，除号召捕杀外，并应组织群众购买红砒及氟矽酸钠进行防治。此项农药应于春、秋两季播种以前预备好。
    ３、对蝗虫与行军虫，目前应着重组织群众捕打及采卵。发生后，应立即扑灭，使其不能成灾，在地广人稀地区，有计划地选择重点，使用六六六毒杀蝗虫。
    ４、对其他虫害如二十八星瓢虫、粟螟虫、蛴螬、油菜虫、金花虫、果虫、菜虫等应根据各地已有成功经验，进行防治。
    ５、在病害方面，着重防治麦类黑穗病及谷子白发病，对小麦黄锈病亦应加强研究工作。药剂拌种及温汤浸种，应分别地区，普遍推广或重点推广，帮助农民购买温度计（一村有一个即可），以便准确掌握浸种温度。
    二、提高耕作技术。提倡深耕细耙，有条件地区争取做到三耕四耙。提高肥料质量，研究施肥技术。提倡在现有基础上适当加宽行距，缩短株距，改善中耕方法。
    １、小麦：为了达到一九五一年小麦增产目的，特别注意春季施追肥、灌溉和锄麦。察绥引种冬小麦还在试验阶段，应特别慎重。要积极研究栽培技术，引种优良麦种。
    ２、棉花：应大力推行：（１）秋季深耕，早春细耙，精选种子，浸种及早间苗，密留苗，晚定苗，保证棉田不缺苗；如遇天旱，大力发动抗旱点种。（２）美棉应加宽行距，实行中耕培土，并视地力肥瘦，调整株距。（３）打破棉田不能多施肥和不能施追肥的错误观点，应指导群众多施基肥，并早期加施追肥。（４）在精耕施肥的基础上美棉须适宜地整枝打杈。
    ３、杂粮：谷子是适合华北干旱地区的丰产作物，除加宽行距，集中施肥（条施）外，应当特别注意锄苗中耕，锄苗要早，中耕要三、四次。玉米应发动群众选种，组织异品种间杂交。甘薯农林四号，胜利百号可以不翻蔓，水地及秋雨较多地区，提倡高畦栽培。
    ４、碱地在华北数量很大，农民已有很多改良碱地耕作技术的创造，应注意推广。在察、绥地广人稀，土瘦肥缺的地区，应注意土地的合理利用，如轮作、休闲，以培养地力，提高产量。易闹水旱灾害地区，应注意推广群众中抗旱防涝的耕作技术。
    三、普及良种。开展夏秋两季选种运动，普遍发动群众选种，换种，自留种，一般地不应进行远距离调剂种籽，并要求在五年内分期完成各种主要作物良种的评选工作，各省根据具体情况制定计划。在选种中要特别注意小麦抗疸选种工作。经过评比，不但要把优良的品种比出来，同时也要把最好的技术比出来，使选种运动与栽培技术密切结合。
    贯彻粮食棉花良种繁殖制度：在粮食方面，以专区及县农场为中心，组织繁殖推广网，并普遍发展农民的小农场，留种地，根据良种评选和推广需要建立良种繁殖区。良种繁殖除玉米及蔬菜种子需要隔离繁殖外，其余作物优良品种，无需集中繁殖。在水旱灾区应注意有计划地调剂及推广早熟抗灾种子。在棉花方面，应建立良种繁殖区，集中繁殖，分区集中推广，避免混杂。河北、平原推广种为斯字棉二Ｂ及四号，就现有基础力求普及。晋西南推广斯字棉四号。其他地区推广金字棉。未推广到的地区，要求加强选种，在原有基础上提高一步。
    四、试验研究工作。试验研究工作是提高技术的重要一环，但必须结合广大群众生产经验去研究，反对只关门试验，不结合群众。一九五一年试验研究的主要项目为：小麦黄锈病，春麦杆锈病，棉、麦春化应用，棉花落蕾落铃，玉米品种间杂交，耕作栽培，农家造肥，施肥，甘薯腐烂病，马铃薯疫病与毒素病，棉花、小麦、杂粮、洋麻选优育种等试验，但不可贪多，半途而废，要有始有终，要分别轻重缓急，明确分工，统一步调，避免重复，以提高工作效率。试验研究方法，应依照一九五○年的农业技术会议决定，“选优育种试验方法”，“品种比较试验方法”，及“玉米改进方法”进行杂交育种，必须依据目的选择材料，进行方法自第二代起，即单穗或单株分离繁殖，逐年选优汰劣。
    为了保证上述任务的胜利完成，必须加强组织领导，开展群众性的提高农业技术运动。
    第一、一切农村工作者必须重视技术，把领导农民改进技术当作重要任务，加强对农业技术的学习，一切农业技术人员必须深入群众，了解农民的实际情况，把理论与实践结合起来。
    第二、必须加强农业技术的宣传教育，有计划地开办短期训练班、轮训班，使县、区、村干部在三年内都能受到技术训练。编印通俗的农业科学读物，以提高农村干部的技术知识。增加农业职业学校及专修班，大批训练初级的农业技术人材，配合教育部门办好农业学校训练较高的农业技术人员，以充实农场及农业机构。
    第三、必须加强各级政府农业行政部门，对各级农场及专业机构的领导。在其统一领导下，分工合作，各有专责。华北农业科学研究所及省农场负责育种及其他较高深的试验，专区农场的任务为繁殖良种及栽培试验，并在上级农场统一计划下进行品种比较及区域试验等。县农场主要任务为示范、繁殖与推广，有条件地进行观察比较试验。
    第四、为交流群众经验，发扬群众创造，要有计划地发展农民的技术组织，如技术委员会、技术小组、小农场等，并加强对其领导与帮助。
    第五、发扬提高技术与组织起来相结合的经验，开展丰产竞赛运动，通过奖励劳动模范，评比运动，使提高技术得到更广泛的发展。
