Xinhua News Agency, March 14th -- A strike movement, the most vigorous since the end of the civil war, has broken out in Spain in resistance to fascist rule.

The prelude to the strike movement was a boycott by the people of Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city, two weeks ago to protest the rise in tram fares. The boycott lasted for several days and eventually forced the local government to cancel the fare increase. On March 12, 300,000 industrial workers in Barcelona held a general strike to protest rising living costs. The general strike received widespread support, with all public and private institutions, shops, and vegetable markets in Barcelona striking and closing their doors. Even many factory owners and shopkeepers joined the ranks of the strikers. The city of Barcelona, with a population of 2.2 million, was completely paralyzed. Trams, buses, and taxis all stopped running, garbage was not collected, and even water, electricity, and gas were cut off for several hours. Long lines of worker pickets appeared for the first time in front of factories and public buildings. Angry crowds also gathered in front of the city hall and the grain price control bureau to demonstrate.

After the general strike and demonstration of the people of Barcelona broke out, Franco frantically convened an emergency cabinet meeting. Subsequently, the Spanish fascist government threatened to deal severely with the people engaged in heroic struggle. Large numbers of military police began to implement forceful suppression, and the trade unions controlled by Franco also coerced workers, factory owners, and shopkeepers to resume work, reopen factories, and reopen shops. However, the workers not only persisted unyieldingly, but also, this general strike spread like wildfire to the surrounding industrial cities of Sabadell, Badalona, and Tarrasa.

In discussing this heroic struggle of the Spanish people, Moscow Radio's broadcast on the evening of the 12th commented: "The root cause of this strike lies in the greatly deepened suffering of the Spanish workers and Franco's policy of selling Spain out to American imperialism for war." Moscow Radio, in mentioning Franco's recent warmongering speeches, declared: "The 300,000 workers of Barcelona have already given a response to his talk, they have shown the world's people the anger of the Spanish workers." The anti-fascist "Independent Spain" radio station declared on the evening of the 12th: The strike in Barcelona shows the Spanish people's resistance to the fascist regime. The radio station called on all Spanish workers to support the strikers.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th – The strike movement of the Spanish people against fascist rule and against high living costs is still heroically persisting as of the 14th. Although Franco has exhausted all means of suppression, 150,000 workers in Barcelona and nearby cities are still on strike. They resolutely declared: They will not resume work until the arrested strike leaders are released.

In the face of the heroic resistance of the Spanish people, the Franco reactionary government has completely fallen into panic. In Barcelona, Sabadell and other strike areas, the reactionaries are frantically arresting striking workers. As of the 14th, more than a thousand people have been arrested. In order to carry out the suppression, Franco even dispatched a large number of troops, and even sent five warships, fully loaded with marines, to Barcelona to assist the local military police. Barcelona has become an armed barracks. The Franco gang is truly in a state of extreme anxiety and suspicion; it even preemptively dispatched a large number of military police to the large mining areas of Oviedo province, fearing that the miners there, who have a tradition of heroic struggle, would follow in the footsteps of the Barcelona pioneers.

The heroic struggle of the Spanish people not only frightened Franco, but also frightened his American masters across the Atlantic. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 13th, "U.S. officials are watching the Barcelona incident with great attention." Even American politicians, who are trying their best to pull Franco into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, cannot help but worry about their plans, because "the Barcelona incident may prove the fact that when the living conditions of a country cause extreme dissatisfaction among the people, controlling the country with elite government police may sometimes not be enough."

### 西班牙人民反法西斯运动声势浩大  巴塞罗那三十万工人总罢工  罢工浪潮正冲破佛朗哥镇压向周围城市扩展中

　　西班牙人民反法西斯运动声势浩大
    巴塞罗那三十万工人总罢工
    罢工浪潮正冲破佛朗哥镇压向周围城市扩展中
    【新华社十四日讯】西班牙爆发了自内战结束以来声势最为浩大的反抗法西斯统治的罢工运动。
    罢工运动的先声是两周前西班牙第二大城巴塞罗那人民抗议电车票涨价的抵制运动。抵制运动持续了好几天，曾终于迫使当地政府取消了涨价的命令。三月十二日，巴塞罗那的三十万产业工人又举行抗议生活费用上涨的总罢工。总罢工得到广泛的支援，巴塞罗那全城各公私机关、商店和菜市纷纷罢工、罢市，甚至许多工厂的厂主和商店的店主都参加了罢工者的行列。拥有二百二十万人口的巴塞罗那城完全瘫痪了，电车、公共汽车和出租汽车全部停止行驶，垃圾无人清除，甚至水、电和煤气都中断了数小时。长长的工人纠察队第一次出现在工厂和公共建筑物面前。愤怒的群众并齐集在市政厅和粮价管制局面前示威。
    巴塞罗那人民的总罢工和示威运动爆发后，佛朗哥手忙脚乱地召集了内阁紧急会议。接着，西班牙法西斯政府便威吓说要以严厉手段对付英勇斗争的人民。大批军警开始实行强力镇压，佛朗哥控制下的工会也胁迫工人、厂主和店主们复工、开厂及开市。然而工人们不但坚持不屈，而且，这个总罢工还像野火一样向周围的工业城市——萨巴德尔、巴达隆纳、达拉沙蔓延着。
    在论及西班牙人民的这一英勇斗争时，莫斯科电台十二日晚的广播评称：“这次罢工的根源，在于西班牙工人的苦难大大加深以及佛朗哥把西班牙出卖给美帝国主义的战争政策。”莫斯科电台在提到佛朗哥最近兜售战争的演说时宣称：“巴塞罗那三十万工人已经对他的谈话给予了一个答复，他们向世界人民显示了西班牙工人的愤怒。”反法西斯的“独立西班牙”电台于十二日晚宣称：巴塞罗那的罢工显示了西班牙人民对于法西斯政权的反抗。该电台号召全体西班牙工人声援罢工者。
    【新华社十五日讯】西班牙人民反对法西斯统治、反对生活费用高涨的罢工运动，至十四日仍在英勇坚持中。虽然佛朗哥用尽一切镇压手段，巴塞罗那及附近各城市仍有十五万工人在罢工。他们坚决宣布：在被捕罢工领袖未获释放以前决不复工。
    在西班牙人民的英勇反抗面前，佛朗哥反动政府完全陷入了惊慌失措。在巴塞罗那，萨巴德尔等罢工地区，反动派正在疯狂地逮捕罢工工人，迄十四日止，被捕者已在千人以上。为了进行镇压，佛朗哥竟出动了大量军队，甚至派了五艘军舰，满装海军陆战队赴巴塞罗那，协助当地军警。巴塞罗那已变成了武装的兵营。佛朗哥匪帮的处境真个是风声鹤唳，草木皆兵，它甚至预先派出了大批军警到奥维多省的大矿区去，害怕那里的具有英勇斗争传统的矿工步巴塞罗那先驱者的后尘。
    西班牙人民的英勇斗争不仅吓慌了佛朗哥，而且也吓慌了他在大西洋彼岸的美国主子。据法新社华盛顿十三日电透露：“美国官方人士以极大的注意注视着巴塞罗那事件”。就是竭力主张把佛朗哥拉入北大西洋侵略集团的美国政客们也不能不为他们的计划担心，因为“巴塞罗那事件可能证明一个事实：当一个国家的生活条件引起人民的极端不满时，以精锐的政府警察来控制这个国家也会有时不够的”。
