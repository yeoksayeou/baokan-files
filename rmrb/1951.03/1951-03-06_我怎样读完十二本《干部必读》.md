　　Recently, I took advantage of my sick leave to finish reading the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" compiled by Jiefang Publishing House. Because these works cover such a wide range, I often felt while reading that without a fairly broad theoretical knowledge, as well as general knowledge of foreign revolutionary history, Western philosophy history, and Chinese revolutionary history, it would be difficult to understand their entire content. For example, when studying the "Communist Manifesto," a general understanding of many historical facts in the mid-19th century and the various socialist trends of thought popular at that time is necessary; when studying "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," a deeper understanding of idealism and the 18th-century materialism system is also essential; when studying "Lenin and Stalin on China," even more extensive knowledge of Chinese revolutionary history is required; and when studying "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," sufficient common sense of political economy is also necessary. The book "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Methodology" was originally excerpted from many philosophical works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. If there is a lack of knowledge of dialectical materialism, it would be difficult to fully understand it. The two books, "Political Economy" and "A Short History of Social Development," are also not easy to thoroughly understand. In particular, when Lenin wrote "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," he had expected it "to be examined by the Tsarist government." Therefore, he "had to write in an extremely cautious tone, using hints, using Aesopian language" (Lenin: Preface to the Russian edition of "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism"), which made it even more difficult for beginners to understand the meaning of certain sentences in the book. Moreover, except for the relatively smooth translations of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" and some of Comrade Stalin's papers, the translations of other books are very difficult to understand. These situations have indeed increased the difficulty for readers. However, despite these difficulties, we cannot say that we should not read these books, nor can we say that we must first be proficient in Chinese and foreign revolutionary history, philosophy history, and dialectical materialism-historical materialism before we are qualified to read the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres." Take myself as an example, my conditions in these aspects are very insufficient, but in the process of reading, these difficulties did not stop my progress, and I was never intimidated by them. On the contrary, I continued to read, and after reading each chapter and section, I often couldn't bear to put it down, and often felt that these works would benefit everyone. This is because mastering Marxism-Leninism and even achieving certain accomplishments in the academic research of Marxism-Leninism will certainly be a long-term, lifelong career; and obtaining instructions from the classic works of Marxism-Leninism as a guide in our daily work is an urgent requirement of the objective situation for the broad masses of cadres today, and it is also an urgent matter that many cadres have subjectively realized. We can say with certainty that no matter what kind of work one is engaged in, as long as one is determined to read "Must-Read for Cadres," one will gain many valuable inspirations, and one will be able to immediately use them to improve or further do one's own work well.

    For example, in order to carry out the propaganda work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we should understand: Why is the complete liberation of the Chinese people inseparable from opposing imperialist aggression? What exactly is imperialism? How can it be defeated? Why can the Chinese people consciously launch the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending their homes and country in the current situation? Why is this movement a high expression of patriotism and internationalism? The two books "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" and "Lenin and Stalin on China" answer these questions very well. Understanding these questions will undoubtedly strengthen our understanding of this movement from a rational perspective, thereby helping us to further do a good job in propaganda work.

    For example, if you are a political worker with leadership responsibilities, you should grasp political principles at all times and in all places. Whether in the construction of state power, in the application of the people's democratic united front, or in daily leadership work, on the one hand, you should adhere to a clear class stand on the distinction between friends and enemies; on the other hand, you should have flexible leadership skills. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were great figures with high achievements in these areas. In many works of "Must-Read for Cadres," we have repeatedly seen how Lenin and Stalin deeply hated and criticized bureaucracy, commandism, and the petty-bourgeois hot and cold disease of leaning to the "left" or "right" in leadership. Stalin correctly taught us: "The art of leadership is a serious matter. It is impossible to fall behind the movement, because falling behind means being separated from the masses. But it is also impossible to run too far ahead, because running too far ahead means losing one's connection with the masses. Anyone who wants to lead the movement and at the same time wants to maintain his connection with millions of people should carry out the struggle on two fronts, both against those who fall behind and against those who run too far ahead." (Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction, Volume II, page 377) Such brilliant instructions can be found almost everywhere in "Must-Read for Cadres," and they have such a significant educational significance for us!

    For example, if you are an economic worker, you should have a full understanding of the basic principles of our country's economic construction, the interrelationship between the five economic components, and the policies of giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other between urban and rural areas, and exchanging goods between domestic and foreign markets. If you have a preliminary understanding of the basic principles of political economy and the basic construction experience of the Soviet Union during the New Economic Policy period, it will greatly help you understand these issues. What is the reason why we are vigorously restoring and developing agricultural production today, and in the preparation work for industrialization, we first focus on the construction of heavy industry? The Soviet Union, starting from 1921, in the first period of the New Economic Policy, first took the development of agriculture as the basic principle. Lenin had long pointed out: "In order to develop industry, we must start with agriculture." Because with the development of agriculture, it can promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, internal and external exchanges, and prepare conditions for industrialization. Subsequently, when the agricultural construction had already achieved the expected results, and the policy of accelerating industrialization had been placed on the work agenda, Stalin repeatedly pointed out: "The center of industrialization, its foundation, lies in the development of heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and in the final analysis, it is the development of the production of means of production, and the development of the country's machine manufacturing industry." Isn't the valuable experience of the Soviet Union an important reference for our country's economic construction?

    For example, if you are a financial worker, you should understand the great role of streamlining and saving in accumulating national production funds. At the beginning of the founding of the Soviet Union, it was in the encirclement of international imperialism, and the domestic famine was very serious. It could neither obtain loans from abroad nor issue a large number of public bonds, so it could only rely on streamlining and saving to accumulate funds for industrial construction. Moreover, throughout the entire construction process of Soviet socialism, saving was an important method of accumulating funds. Lenin and Stalin called this the "road of socialist accumulation." Although our country's conditions today are much better than those of the Soviet Union at that time, it is necessary to strive for streamlining and saving to restore and develop our various constructions, which is a very obvious principle.

    For example, if you are a diplomatic worker, you should understand the truth of "leaning to one side" and understand the great significance of the alliance between China and the Soviet Union. Originally, Lenin and Stalin had theoretically linked the national liberation movement of colonies and semi-colonies with the world proletarian revolution, and recognized the former as a part of the latter. Stalin emphasized even more when commemorating the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution: "The October Revolution established a powerful open center of the world revolutionary movement, which the world revolutionary movement had never had before, and now it can unite around this center and organize the unified revolutionary front of the proletarians and oppressed nations of all countries against imperialism." (Lenin and Stalin on China, page 333) This shows that uniting around the Soviet Union, consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship, expanding the international united front, and striving for world lasting peace have become our country's firm diplomatic policy, which is completely in line with the common interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world. After understanding these principles, we will be able to work even harder with full confidence to implement this policy.

    For example, if you are a military worker, you should know the importance of consolidating national defense and severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries for striving for a peaceful construction environment; if you are a party affairs worker, you should understand Lenin's theory of party building and absorb the struggle experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) in various periods; with these, reading the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" will naturally give you great education and help.

    Taking the daily specific work of various departments as an example, "Must-Read for Cadres" can also help us solve many specific problems. For example, in cooperative work, perhaps some people still underestimate its importance, but Lenin constantly emphasized the importance of cooperative work. Lenin believed that doing a good job in cooperatives can play a significant role in adjusting the relationship between industry and agriculture, consolidating the economic foundation of the worker-peasant alliance, and transitioning to the road of socialist national industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Another example is trade union work. There are also individual comrades who underestimate the role of trade unions in completing national construction tasks. They have not ideologically recognized that trade unions are the "closest and most necessary colleagues" of the state power led by the proletariat, a "school of communism," and a school for learning to manage "industry (and gradually also agriculture)" (Lenin's words). Therefore, they do not understand how to actively improve the cultural and political level and management skills of workers through trade union organizations. Some trade unions are almost nominal, which is the reason. If they have read "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," and discovered from it that Lenin originally attached so much importance to trade unions, and discovered that trade unions can play a huge role in implementing worker supervision, organizing production competitions, and uniting and educating the masses, it will be easy to correct their deviations.

    In short, the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" contain the basic knowledge of all aspects of Marxism-Leninism. In daily practical work, if one does not understand the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism, one can only blindly and passively engage in one's own work, and it is easy to create empiricism, bureaucratism, and various deviations in work. Even with good intentions and unrestrained enthusiasm, one often cannot produce good work results, and often things go against one's wishes, which is a fact that many people have experienced. Therefore, studying Marxism-Leninism, linking the guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism with each person's specific work, and actively guiding our work has become the direction that every cadre must strive for today, and systematically self-studying the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" has also become one of our directions of effort.

    Some people will say that I understand all the principles you have talked about, and I have long had the ambition to finish reading the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres," but I feel that my heart is willing but my strength is insufficient, and I feel that I cannot squeeze out time to read them. These comrades are worried about how much time it will take to read them once? Naturally, there are various degrees of reading. As mentioned earlier, if you want to master all the theories of "Must-Read for Cadres," it will take a lifetime of effort. If you only seek to read them relatively carefully once, and leave difficult questions to be solved slowly in the future, then, according to my experience, no matter how busy a person is, they can finish reading them in two or three years. In total, these twelve books ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" has two volumes) have 3,381 pages (each page is counted as two sides). I spent four months reading them this time, averaging three hours a day, about 30 pages, and averaging ten pages per hour. When reading, I often have to think about questions, ask questions, and there are some annotations after each article or each book. If calculated in this way, then reading for one hour (ten pages) a day can be completed in one year, reading for half an hour (five pages) a day can be completed in two years, and if you plan to complete it in three years, you only need to read for 20 minutes a day. Is there anyone who can't even do this? In fact, those who make excuses for being busy and do not engage in self-study can only be said to be showing a lack of perseverance, or showing that they are willing to be intellectual lazybones!

    In addition, some people, seeing such a large pile of "Must-Read for Cadres," do not know which book to start reading from? Yes, I also considered this question at first, and then I decided to start reading from "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." Because Chairman Mao instructed in the article "Reform Our Study": "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the highest synthesis of the world communist movement in the past 100 years, and is a typical example of the combination of theory and practice. It is still the only complete example in the world." Starting from this book, one can first obtain a relatively complete concept of the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism, and can remind oneself to prevent the most habitual dogmatic learning attitude of intellectuals from the vivid examples of Lenin and Stalin combining the universal truth of Marxism with the practice of the Soviet revolution, and initially understand that learning the theory of Marxism-Leninism should originally be linked to the practice of the Chinese revolution and to one's own specific work. Then, I considered that learning Marxism-Leninism should first establish a Marxist-Leninist world outlook, that is to say, one must first have a firm and clear understanding of the laws of development of human society and the economic structure of the five social forms. I decided to read "A Short History of Social Development," "Political Economy," "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and "On Socialist Economic Construction" in order. In this way, I really had a series of understandings of the developmental stages of the entire human society. With this understanding, I was able to more firmly establish the revolutionary outlook on life of the proletariat and work harder with more confidence. Then, I decided to read the representative works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in chronological order - "The Communist Manifesto," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," "The State and Revolution," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," and "On the Foundations of Leninism." In this way, one can roughly understand Engels' supplementary contributions to "The Communist Manifesto" in the work of criticizing utopian socialism and establishing scientific socialism; Lenin's development of Marxism in the issue of the state, the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the issue of the form of government, and the work of criticizing various fake Marxisms; Stalin's brilliant interpretation and development of Leninism in summarizing the work of Leninism. Finally, reading "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Methodology" and "Lenin and Stalin on China," the former can further recognize the consistency of Marxist-Leninist theory and revolutionary practice from the perspective of methodology; the latter can be more realistically linked to the problems of the Chinese revolution. After reading it once, I consciously felt that each book seemed to be related to the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and felt that it was necessary to reread it. Sure enough, when I reread it, I felt that this work was a great classic of Marxism-Leninism, and it was particularly refreshing and clear to read, and it seemed to be a comprehensive review of the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres." Therefore, I think that although the reading order does not matter too much, it is very meaningful to take the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" as the starting point and end point.

　　我怎样读完十二本《干部必读》
    邹树民
    最近，我利用病中休养的机会，读完了解放社所编的十二本《干部必读》。由于这些著作牵涉的范围太广，使我在阅读时常常感到，如果没有具备相当广泛的理论知识，以及关于外国革命史、西洋哲学史与中国革命史的一般知识，要想懂得它们的全部内容，是不容易的。例如研究《共产党宣言》，对上世纪中叶国际间的许多史实，以及当时流行的各派社会主义思潮，就须有概略的认识；研究《社会主义从空想到科学的发展》，对唯心论及十八世纪的唯物论体系，也非有较深的理解不可；研究《列宁、斯大林论中国》，更须具备相当丰富的中国革命史知识；研究《帝国主义论》，也非有足够的政治经济学常识不可。《马恩列斯思想方法论》一书，原是从马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的许多哲学著作中摘录而成的，如果原来缺少辩证唯物论的知识，也就很难完全理解。而《政治经济学》、《社会发展简史》二书，也不是容易透彻领会的。特别是列宁在写《帝国主义论》一书时，本就预计“要经过沙皇政府检查的”。因此“不得不用极其谨慎的口吻，用暗示的方法，用伊索寓言式的文字”来写（列宁：《帝国主义论》俄文版序言），这就使初学者更不易理解书中某些辞句的含义。而且，除《联共（布）党史简明教程》及斯大林同志的若干论文的翻译文字比较顺畅以外，其他各书，译文都很艰涩。这些情形，的确增加了读者不少的困难。可是，虽然有这些困难，我们并不能说，我们就不应该读这些书，也不能说，我们必须事先精通中外革命史、哲学史及辩证唯物论——历史唯物论，然后才有资格读十二本《干部必读》。拿我自己来说，我在这些方面条件就很不够，但在阅读过程中，这些困难并没有阻止我的前进，我也从没有被它们吓倒过，相反的，我读下去了，而且读完一章一节，往往不忍释手，往往感到这些著作，对每个人说来都将开卷有益。这是因为精通马克思列宁主义乃至在马克思列宁主义的学术研究上，获得某些成就，定将是长期的、毕生的事业；而从马克思列宁主义的经典著作中取得指示，作为我们在日常工作中的指南，却是今天的客观形势对广大干部的迫切要求，也是许多干部已经在主观上体认到的迫不及待的事。我们可以肯定地说，无论从事那一种工作的人，只要决心阅读《干部必读》，就将获得许多宝贵的启示，就能够即时地利用它们来改进或进一步做好自己的工作。
    例如，为了进行抗美援朝的宣传工作，我们就应该了解：中国人民的彻底解放，为什么与反对帝国主义的侵略分不开？帝国主义究竟是什么东西？要怎样才能把它打倒？中国人民为什么能够在今天的形势下，自觉地掀起抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动？这个运动为什么是爱国主义和国际主义的高度表现？《帝国主义论》和《列宁、斯大林论中国》二书，很好地答复了这些问题。理解这些问题，无疑地会从理性上加强我们对这个运动的认识，从而帮助我们进一步做好宣传工作。
    例如，你是一个负有领导责任的政治工作者，你就应该随时随地掌握政治原则性。无论在国家政权的建设工作上，在人民民主统一战线的运用上，在日常的领导工作上，一方面应该坚持敌友分明的阶级立场；一方面又应该有灵活的领导艺术。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林就正是在这些方面有高度造就的伟大人物。在《干部必读》的许多著作中，我们屡次见到列宁、斯大林曾是怎样深恶痛绝地揭露和批评了领导上的官僚主义、命令主义、以及忽“左”忽右的小资产阶级冷热病。斯大林这样正确地教导我们说：“领导的艺术是一件严重的事情。不可落在运动后面，因为落在后面，就是脱离群众。可是也不可跑得太前，因为跑得太前，就是丧失自己与群众的联系。谁愿意领导运动，同时又愿意保持自己与千百万群众的联系，那他就应进行两条战线上的斗争，既反对落在后面的分子，又反对跑得太前的分子。”（《列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设》下册三七七页）像这类英明的指示，在《干部必读》中几乎随手可摘，对我们不知有多么重大的教育意义！
    又如，你是一个经济工作者，你对于我国经济建设的基本方针，五种经济成份的相互关系，以及公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流等政策，就应该有充分的理解。假使你对政治经济学的基本原则，以及苏联在新经济政策时期的基本建设经验，有初步认识，就会大大地帮助你理解这些问题。我们今天正在大力恢复与发展农业生产，并在工业化的准备工作上，首先着眼于重工业的建设，这是什么道理呢？苏联从一九二一年开始，在新经济政策的第一个时期，便曾首先以发展农业为基本方针。列宁早就指出：“为了发展工业，就必须从农业着手。”因为有了农业的发展，就可促成城乡互助、内外交流，替工业化准备条件。随后，在农业建设已经获得预期的成绩，加速工业化的方针已经摆在工作日程上的时候，斯大林又屡次指出：“工业化的中心，其基础，是在于重工业（燃料、五金等）的发展，归根结底，是生产资料生产之发展，是在于本国的机器制造业之发展。”苏联的宝贵经验难道不是我国经济建设的重要借鉴吗？
    又如，你是一个财政工作者，你就应该懂得精简节约对于积累国家生产资金的重大作用。苏联建国之初，处在国际帝国主义的封锁包围中，国内饥荒又十分严重，既不能从国外取得借款，也不能发行大量的公债，就只有依靠精简节约，积累工业建设的资金。而且在苏联社会主义的整个建设过程中，节约都是积累资金的重要方法。列宁和斯大林把这称之为“社会主义积累的道路”。我国今天虽然比苏联当时的条件优越得多，可是要恢复与发展我国的各项建设，也必须努力精简节约，这是非常明显的道理。
    再如，你是一个外交工作者，你就应该懂得“一边倒”的真理，懂得中苏两国同盟的伟大意义。原来列宁、斯大林早就从理论上把殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动和世界无产阶级革命联系起来，而认前者为后者的一部分。斯大林在纪念十月革命十周年时更强调地指出：“十月革命建立了世界革命运动强大的公开的中心，这个中心是世界革命运动从来未曾有过的，而现在它却能团结在这个中心周围，组织世界各国无产者和被压迫民族的统一革命战线去反对帝国主义了。”（《列宁、斯大林论中国》三三三页）这就说明：团结在苏联的周围，巩固中苏友谊，扩大国际统一战线，争取世界持久和平，成为我国坚定不移的外交方针，这是完全符合中国人民和世界人民的共同利益的。明白了这些道理以后，我们便更能满怀信心地为贯彻这一方针而加倍奋斗。
    再如，你是一个军事工作者，便应该知道巩固国防，严厉镇压反革命，对于争取和平建设环境的重要性；你是一个党务工作者，便应该体会列宁的建党学说，吸取联共（布）党在各个时期的斗争经验；有这些，通过十二本《干部必读》的阅读，自然会给你极大的教育和帮助。
    就拿各部门日常具体的工作来说，《干部必读》也能够给我们解决许多具体问题。比如合作社工作，也许有人对它的重要性仍然估计不足，但是列宁不断强调合作社工作的重要。列宁认为办好合作社，无论在工农业的调剂关系上，在巩固工农联盟的经济基础上，在过渡到社会主义的国家工业化和农业集体化的道路上，都能起显著的作用。又如工会工作，也有个别同志，对职工会在完成国家建设任务中的作用，估计不足。他们没有从思想上认识职工会是无产阶级领导的国家政权的“最亲近和最必需的同事”，是“共产主义的学校”，是学习管理“工业（尔后也逐渐管理农业）的学校”（列宁语）。因此他们不懂得通过工会组织，积极地提高职工的文化政治水平和管理业务的技能。有些职工会，几乎形同虚设，便是这个道理。假使他们读过《列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设》，从里面发觉列宁对职工会原是这么重视，发觉职工会原来在实施工人监督、组织生产竞赛，团结与教育群众等方面，能够起极大的作用，也就很容易纠正自己的偏向了。
    总之，十二本《干部必读》，包含了马克思列宁主义各方面的基本知识。在日常的实际工作中，如果不懂得马克思列宁主义的基本理论，便只能是盲目地、被动地从事于自己的工作，便容易造成工作中的经验主义、事务主义和各种各样的偏向，即使有良善的动机，有奔放的热情，也往往不能产生良好的工作效果，往往事与愿违，这是许多人都已体验到的事实。所以学习马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义的指导原则，和每个人的具体工作联系起来，能动地指导我们的工作，已经成为今天每个干部所必须努力的方向，而有计划地自修十二本《干部必读》，也就成了我们努力的方向之一。
    有人会说，你讲的这些道理，我全都明白，我也早就有读完十二本《干部必读》的抱负，只是感觉心有余而力不足，感觉挤不出时间来读它们。这些同志担心着读完一遍，究竟需要多少时间？自然，有各种不同程度的读法，前面已经提到，如果要精通《干部必读》的全部理论，那是要花一辈子功夫的。如果说只求比较细心地读完一遍，疑难问题，留待以后慢慢解决，那么，根据我的经验，无论怎样忙的人，是可以在二、三年内读完它们的。总计这十二部书（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设有上下二册”）有三三八一面（每页以两面计），我这次花了四个月的时间读完，平均每天读三小时，约三十面，每小时平均读十面，读的时候，往往还要想问题、提问题，在每一篇文章或每一本书后面，还有些批注。假使按照这样来计算，那么，每天读一小时（十面），一年便可读完，每天读半小时（五面），二年可以读完，如果预定三年读完的话，就只需每天读二十分钟了。难道有人连这也办不到吗？实在说来，那些借口工作忙碌而不从事自修的人，只能说是没有恒心的表现，或者是甘愿做思想上的懒汉的表现！
    另外，也有一些人，看到这样一大堆《干部必读》，不知从那一本读起才好？是的，我在最初也曾经考虑过这一问题，后来我决定从《联共（布）党史简明教程》读起。因为毛主席在《改造我们的学习》一文中曾指示说：“联共党史是一百年来全世界共产主义运动的最高的综合与总结，是理论与实际结合的典型，在全世界上还只有这个完全的典型。”从这本书开始，对马克思列宁主义的理论与实际，可先获得一个比较完整的概念，可以从列宁、斯大林把马克思主义的普遍真理与苏联革命实践结合的生动事例中，提醒自己预防知识分子那种最习惯的教条主义学习态度，并初步懂得学习马克思列宁主义的理论，原是应该与中国的革命实践联系起来，与自己的具体工作联系起来的。然后，我考虑到，学习马克思列宁主义，应首先建立马克思列宁主义的世界观，这就是说，对人类社会的发展规律以及五种社会形态的经济结构，必须先有坚定明确的认识。我便决定按序读《社会发展简史》、《政治经济学》、《帝国主义论》、《论社会主义经济建设》。这样一来，果然对整个人类社会的发展阶段，有一系列的理解，有了这种理解便能够比较牢固地建立无产阶级的革命人生观，更有信心地努力于自己的工作。然后，我又决定按著作时间先后，依次读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的代表性著作——《共产党宣言》、《社会主义从空想到科学的发展》、《国家与革命》、《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》和《论列宁主义基础》等书。这样便可约略领会恩格斯在批判空想社会主义与树立科学社会主义思想的工作上，对《共产党宣言》的补充与发发；列宁在国家问题、无产阶级专政问题、政权形式问题以及批评各色各样的假马克思主义的工作上，对马克思主义的发展；斯大林在总结列宁主义的工作上，对列宁主义的光辉的阐释与发展。最后读《马恩列斯思想方法论》与《列宁、斯大林论中国》二书，前者可以更进一步从思想方法上体认马克思列宁主义理论与革命实践的一致性；后者可以更现实地联系到中国革命问题。这样读完一遍以后，我又自觉地感到每一本书都好像与《联共党史》有关连，感到有重读它的必要。果然，当我再读它时，便感觉这一部著作真是马克思列宁主义的伟大经典，读起来格外爽朗和明快，也好像对十二本《干部必读》，作了一次概括的复习。因此，我认为阅读顺序虽没有太大的关系，但以《联共党史》为始点和终点，却是很有意义的。
