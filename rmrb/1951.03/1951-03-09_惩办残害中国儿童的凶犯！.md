Short commentary:

    The facts of the Guangzhou "Holy Infant Infant Home," run by Canadian "nuns," harming Chinese children, thoroughly expose the nature of the so-called "charitable undertakings" of imperialism in China. These murderers wearing religious masks killed more than two thousand Chinese children in just over a year from the liberation of Guangzhou to the present. The infant mortality rate in the hospital reached as high as 94 percent. Similar situations have been found in the "Sacred Heart Children's Home" established by French imperialists in Nanjing. In the "Sacred Heart Children's Home," from January 1948 to June 1950, 372 out of 557 admitted children died, with a mortality rate of just under 65 percent. Recently, the "Nanjing Benevolent Infant Nursery" was discovered. Under the abuse of foreign nuns from the United States, Germany, Austria, and other countries, from July 1, 1949, to December 31, 54 out of 69 admitted infants died, with a mortality rate of just over 78 percent. These hypocritical imperialist elements are such vicious executioners and such inhuman beasts! In their eyes, Chinese children and the Chinese people can be trampled and ravaged by them at will.
    Their purpose in running so-called "charitable undertakings" in China is to kill Chinese people—including newborn babies—in various ways.
    All the hypocrisy of imperialism can no longer deceive the eyes of the Chinese people. The flames of anger of millions of Chinese mothers can no longer be extinguished! We demand that the People's Government thoroughly investigate the serious crimes committed by the Guangzhou "Holy Infant Infant Home" against the Chinese people. Those imperialist elements with heinous crimes must be tried and convicted by the people's court to avenge our children who died tragically at the hands of imperialist blood!

　　惩办残害中国儿童的凶犯！
    由加拿大“修女”所主持的广州“圣婴婴院”残害我国儿童的事实，彻底地暴露了帝国主义在中国的所谓“慈善事业”的本质。这些戴着宗教面幕的杀人罪犯们，仅仅在广州解放到现在的年余时间内，杀害了两千多个我国儿童。在该院中收容的婴儿死亡率高达百分之九十四，类似的情形已曾发现于法帝国主义者在南京设立的“圣心儿童院”中。在“圣心儿童院”里，从一九四八年一月到一九五○年六月为止，在五百五十七名入院儿童中，就有三百七十二名死亡，死亡率是百分之六十五弱。最近发现“南京慈爱育婴院”，在美、德、奥等外籍修女的虐待下，从一九四九年七月一日至十二月三十一日为止，在六十九名入院婴儿中，有五十四名死亡，死亡率是百分之七十八强。这些假冒为善的帝国主义分子就是这样狠毒的刽子手，就是这样毫无人心的禽兽！在他们的心目中，中国儿童和中国人民是可以任凭他们作践和糟蹋的。
    他们之所以在中国举办所谓“慈善事业”的目的，就是用各种方式来杀害中国人民——包括刚刚出生的婴儿在内。
    帝国主义的一切假冒为善，再也不能瞒住中国人的眼睛了。千万个中国母亲的愤怒的火焰，再也不能平息！我们要求人民政府彻查广州“圣婴婴院”对于中国人民所犯的严重罪过。那些罪大恶极的帝国主义分子，必须由人民法院加以审讯判罪，为我们惨死在帝国主义血手中的儿童们复仇！
