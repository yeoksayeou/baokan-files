Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

To the Editors:

We sincerely accept the criticism from Comrade Wei Ping published in the People's Daily on January 16 regarding the heating and dampness of public grain in our district. In addition to notifying all supply stations to be vigilant about this serious situation, we hope that the newspaper will continue to offer more criticisms of our shortcomings in our work, so that we can improve our work.

In December of last year, our headquarters discovered that 300,000 jin of brown rice was heating up and 300,000 jin of cooked rice was damp (this was rice that was received already damp, and it was put into storage without paying attention) in the Zhengyangguan Direct Grain Station warehouse. At Dianiangang, 140,000 jin of rice was adulterated with water by boatmen, of which 15,000 jin deteriorated (with a distiller's grains smell). At that time, in addition to reporting to higher authorities and requesting instructions on how to deal with it, we ordered the Zhengyangguan Direct Grain Station to immediately turn over the warehouse, and the Dianiangang Station to transport all the damp rice to Zhengyangguan for processing. However, dealing with this huge amount of grain was a new problem in our work. After research and discussion, we finally found a better way, which is: to wrap fresh lime in straw (using a package of 80 jin of lime for every 10,000 jin of grain), and bury it in the rice warehouse, which can absorb moisture and turn it into dry grain, so that it will no longer continue to heat up. If the moisture is very high due to water adulteration, and the temperature is too high, it is necessary to first empty the warehouse to let air in, and then use lime to absorb the moisture. Grain with poorer quality will be allocated in advance. This work is arduous, but through the efforts of our comrades, we finally rescued this large batch of grain that was about to be lost.

The Shou County Chengguan Grain Station received public grain from the Cao'an District, which originally contained 3% to 7% of ash and sand. The main reason for this was that the district leadership did not have a tight grip during the autumn grain collection work, especially since the work of handing over the grain to the warehouse was entirely handled by the township cadres, and they themselves did not check. Most of the village cadres had a simple task-oriented view, ignoring the quality of the grain, and some were even irresponsible. The county leadership has taken appropriate measures to deal with this matter, and has given criticisms and demerits to the derelict cadres, and has issued a notice to all districts and townships in the county to raise vigilance and prevent the grain from getting damp and damaged.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    使数十万斤受潮公粮免遭损失
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月十六日刊登卫萍同志对我区公粮发热受潮的批评，我们诚恳接受。除将这一严重情况通知各供应站提起警惕外；并希望报纸今后对我们工作上的缺点，尽多提出，以便改进工作。
    本部在去年十二月间即发现正阳关直属粮站仓存粮食有三十万斤糙米发热和三十万斤熟米受潮（这是接收的米，接收时即已发潮，未加注意就入了仓）；大店岗有十四万米斤被船户羼水，其中有一万五千斤变质（有酒糟味）。当时我们除向上级呈报，请示处理办法；并令正阳关直属粮站即时翻仓，大店岗站将受潮的米全部运正阳关处理。但处理这一巨大数目的粮食，在我们工作上是个新的问题，经过研讨，终于找到了一个较好的办法，即是：用稻草包扎新鲜石灰（每万斤粮使用八十斤重的石灰包一个），埋入米仓内，可以吸收潮气，使它变为干粮，即不致再继续发热。如因羼水潮气很大，温度太高时，就得先行倒仓出风，再以石灰吸收水分。成色较差的粮，则提前支拨。这些工作是繁重的，但经过同志们的努力，终于把这一大批将要遭受损失的粮食抢救出来。
    寿县城关粮站接收曹庵区之公粮，原即含有百分之三至百分之七的灰沙，这主要是在秋征工作中，该区领导上掌握的不紧，尤其是中途将缴粮归仓等工作全部交给乡干部办理，而自己又不加以检查。乡村干部则多存在单纯任务观点，忽视粮食的成色，有的甚至不负责任。该县领导上对此事已作适当的处理，对失职干部已分别轻重给予批评及记过处分，并通报全县各区乡政府提高警惕，防备粮食受潮损坏。    六安专区生产救灾治淮指挥部财务处
