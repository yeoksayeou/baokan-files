　　Chinese and Korean Women Inspire Us to Move Forward
    ——An Interview with Representatives of the Returning Chinese People's Volunteers

    On the Korean battlefield, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side, severely hitting the American aggressors and constantly achieving victories. These victories are inseparable from the Korean women, because they bravely and unyieldingly participated in the liberation war of their country, because they loved the Chinese People's Volunteers as if they were their own relatives. Similarly, these victories are also inseparable from the Chinese women, because they supported and encouraged the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to bravely advance!

    Ji Bingqian, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers who returned to the motherland, said excitedly and gratefully: The great power of Korean women in participating in transportation, stretcher-bearing, emergency repairs and other work during the war, and the active role of Chinese women in encouraging their husbands and sons to join the volunteer army, launching comfort activities, propaganda, etc. in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, inspired the brothers of China and Korea who fought side by side, and increased our courage to overcome difficulties and our confidence in defeating the enemy.

    The disasters brought to Korean women by the American aggressors were extremely serious. We personally saw many Korean women who died tragically. They were raped by the American bandits and then killed alive. Their naked, bloody bodies were thrown into the bandits' tanks, trucks, trenches, and barracks. We personally saw the children crying on the cold corpses of their mothers who had been bombed to death, their little hands and faces stained with their mother's blood. Seeing this scene, our soldiers with iron will could not help but shed tears. Everyone solemnly and angrily swore to avenge the mothers and children of Korea.

    The gratitude, love and care of Korean women for the Chinese People's Volunteers is meticulous. Ji Bingqian gave two vivid examples. He said: Once, our troops marched to Dadong, seventy miles north of Yunshan, and stayed in the home of an old woman. The soldiers were so tired and cold that they fell asleep on the kang after entering the house. The owner of the house, old woman Kim Yong-hwa, hurried to add firewood to warm the kang, and gently covered the soldiers' cold feet with blankets. In the middle of the night, the soldiers felt extremely warm. When they got up and looked, they saw that old woman Kim was still guarding the kang, constantly adding firewood. The firelight reflected the old woman's kind face, and it could be seen that she only had that kind of expression on her face when treating her own son who had just returned from afar.

    Korean women demonstrated tenacious combativeness in repairing roads and bridges, participating in transportation, stretcher-bearing, and other work to support the Chinese and Korean people's forces. Once, when our troops' transport vehicles were passing a large bridge near Taecheon, the bridge broke and the transport vehicles could not pass. Our troops were pursuing the enemy and could not stop to repair the bridge. At this time, eighty or ninety Korean women, mobilized by the local government and the Women's League, came to help us repair it. In the dark night of minus twenty degrees, the wind and snow filled the sky, and the women's hands and feet were frozen. But they did not flinch at all, and finally quickly repaired the bridge, ensuring smooth military transport.

    Another volunteer army returning representative, Dong Lefu, described the great encouragement given to the volunteer army commanders and fighters by the women of the motherland. He said: We are very concerned about the news of domestic women in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. When we heard that women were encouraging their husbands and sons to join the volunteer army, to participate in transportation, medical treatment and other work on the Korean front, or to launch comfort activities, propaganda and other movements, our excitement was indescribable. When we saw in the newspapers that this year's New Year in the motherland was more lively than in previous years, and that the folks in our hometown could wear warm new cotton-padded jackets for the winter, we were so happy that we shed tears. We are fighting bravely against the American aggressors in Korea, regardless of any hardships, precisely to defend our great motherland, to defend our mothers, wives and children and their peaceful and happy lives!

    Dong Lefu said: We received hundreds of thousands of comfort bags and letters of sympathy sent from the country. An old woman wrote in her letter: "In the evening, after my grandchildren are asleep, I put on my reading glasses and lean under the light to sew comfort bags for my beloved soldiers..." Many children wrote letters of sympathy to the volunteer army and sent comfort bags. They all called us "Volunteer Army Uncles". We were so happy. The child of a professor at Tsinghua University, who was only five years old, wrote naively in his letter: "My family made a total of seven comfort bags, but none of them were mine. I cried, and especially asked my mother to make one with my name embroidered on it..." When the volunteer army commanders and fighters read these letters, they were very moved and said: "We must use greater victories to answer the love of the mothers and children of the motherland for us!"

    Finally, Chai Chuanruo, the responsible comrade of the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, said: The support and encouragement given to us by the people of the motherland and thousands of mothers and women has enabled us to continuously achieve victories on the front lines. We hope that the mothers, wives and sisters in the motherland will continue to write more letters to the volunteer army commanders and fighters, telling us about the situation in the country and the situation in our hometowns. This will give the volunteer army commanders and fighters on the front lines greater encouragement and achieve greater victories. He also said particularly earnestly: "At the same time, we earnestly hope that the women of the motherland will more actively participate in production and construction work, resisting America and aiding Korea on the one hand, and building our motherland on the other, so that the Chinese people can obtain lasting peace and happiness."

### 中国与朝鲜妇女鼓舞着我们前进——访中国人民志愿军归国代表

　　中国与朝鲜妇女鼓舞着我们前进
    ——访中国人民志愿军归国代表
    在朝鲜战场上，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，严重地打击了美国侵略者，不断地取得了胜利。这些胜利是与朝鲜妇女分不开的，因为她们英勇不屈地参加了祖国的解放战争，因为她们像关心自己的亲人一样地热爱着中国人民志愿军。同样，这些胜利也与中国妇女分不开，因为她们支持与鼓励着中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军奋勇前进！
    回到祖国来的中国人民志愿军代表嵇炳前兴奋而感激地说：朝鲜妇女在战争中参加运输、担架、抢修等工作所发挥的伟大力量，和中国妇女在抗美援朝运动中鼓励丈夫儿子参加志愿军，发动慰劳、宣传等所起的积极作用，鼓舞着并肩作战的中朝两国的兄弟们，增加了我们克服困难的勇气和战胜敌人的信心。
    美国侵略者所带给朝鲜妇女的灾难是异常严重的。我们亲眼看到许多惨死的朝鲜妇女，她们被美国强盗奸污后又活活地被杀死了，她们赤裸着的血肉模糊的身子被丢在强盗们的坦克、卡车、战壕和兵营里。我们亲眼看到那些伏在被炸死的母亲的冰冷尸体上啼哭着的孩子，母亲的鲜血染满了孩子的小手和小脸。看到这种情景，我们有着钢铁意志的战士们，也都忍不住掉下了眼泪。大家沉痛激愤地宣誓要为朝鲜的母亲和孩子们报仇。
    朝鲜妇女对于中国人民志愿军的感激、热爱与照顾是无微不至的。嵇炳前随便举了两个生动的例子。他说：有一次，我们的部队行军到达了云山北边七十里地的大洞，住宿在一家老百姓的家里。战士们因为过分的疲乏和寒冷，进屋后就倒在坑上呼呼入睡了。这屋子的主人金永花老太太，就赶忙添着火把炕烧得暖暖的，又把毯子轻轻地盖在战士们冰冷的脚上。睡到半夜，战士们都觉得暖和极了。他们爬起来一看，只见金老太太还守在火炕旁不断地在添火，火光辉映着老太太慈祥的脸，可以看出她脸上只有对待刚从远方回家的亲生儿子才有的那种神情。
    朝鲜妇女在抢修公路、桥梁、参加运输、担架等各种支援中朝人民部队的工作中，表现了坚韧的战斗性。有一次，当我们部队的运输车经过泰川附近的一座大桥时，桥梁断了，运输车辆过不去。我们的部队正在追击敌人，不可能停留下来修桥。正在这时候，八九十个朝鲜妇女在当地政府和妇女同盟的动员之下来帮助我们抢修。在零下二十度的黑夜里，漫天风雪，妇女们的手和脚都冻僵了。可是她们没有一点畏缩，终于迅速地把桥修好，保证了军运畅通。
    另一位志愿军归国代表董乐辅叙述了祖国妇女所给予志愿军指战员们的极大鼓舞。他说：我们十分关心着国内妇女在抗美援朝运动中的消息。当我们听到妇女们在鼓励丈夫和儿子参加志愿军，参加朝鲜前线的运输医疗等各种工作或发动慰劳、宣传等运动时，我们的兴奋是无法形容的。当我们在报纸上看到祖国今年的新年过得比往年热闹，家乡的乡亲们都能穿上暖和的新棉袄过冬时，我们都喜欢得流泪。我们在朝鲜不顾任何艰苦，对美国侵略者奋勇作战，也正是为了要保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫我们的母亲、妻子和孩子们以及她们的和平幸福生活啊！
    董乐辅说：我们收到了好几十万份从国内寄到的慰问袋和慰问信。有一位老太太在她的信上这样写着：“晚上等我的孙儿们都睡熟了，我就戴上老花眼镜，凑在灯光下为我敬爱的战士缝慰问袋……。”许多孩子们给志愿军写了慰问信并送慰劳袋，他们都称我们“志愿军伯伯”，我们真高兴极了。有位清华大学教授的孩子，只有五岁，在他的信上天真地写着：“我家共做了七只慰问袋，就是没有我的份，我哭了，特地叫妈也做了一只绣上我的名字……”志愿军指战员们读到这些信的时候都非常感动地说：“我们一定要用更大的胜利来回答祖国的母亲们和孩子们对我们的热爱！”
    最后，志愿军归国代表团负责同志柴川若说：祖国人民和千千万万母亲和妇女给予我们的支援和鼓舞，使我们能在前线不断地取得胜利。我们希望在祖国的母亲、妻子和姊妹们继续多多地写信给志愿军指战员们，告诉我们国内的情况和家乡的情况。这将使前线的志愿军指战员们得到更大的鼓舞，取得更大的胜利。他又特别恳切地说：“同时，我们热切地希望祖国的妇女更加积极地参加生产建设工作，一面抗美援朝，一面建设我们的祖国，使中国人民获得持久和平与幸福。”
