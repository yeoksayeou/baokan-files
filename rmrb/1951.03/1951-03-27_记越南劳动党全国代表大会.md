　　On the National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party
    Gang Xin
    Those who have the honor of living through these epoch-making days of the National Congress, their first thought is to remember those martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the victory of the revolution. As President Ho Chi Minh said: "They were only a few, but their determination was great, and their hope was great. Their determination and hope have now become the determination and hope of all our people." This is a true National Congress in the seventh year of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    In the creative hands of the laboring men and women and artists who deeply love the Party, a vast forest has been transformed into a beautiful park. The National Congress hall is a large, simple, and beautiful building. This place will soon be recorded in history, just like Tân Trào, which witnessed the birth of the new Vietnam (in Tuyên Quang Province, 160 kilometers northwest of Hanoi – editor's note), and the Trần Hưng Đạo Forest (North Vietnam – editor's note) where the founding of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army was celebrated years ago.
    The Congress opened on February 11, 1951.
    Approximately 200 male and female delegates from all over the country attended. This Congress is a picture of the unprecedented greatness of the Vietnamese Revolution. Here we see: an old sailor who participated in the Black Sea uprising, an old comrade who worked under the banner of the Guangzhou Commune, a fighter who fought in the Nghệ An Soviet, a guerrilla fighter from Bắc Sơn, a comrade who spent part of his life in the prisons of Côn Lôn Island, a young army commander who won victories on the border front. They all reflect the most glorious page in our country's history. Some are comrades who established people's base areas in the Central and Northern Vietnamese highlands, some are people who established and defended the reed plains of South Vietnam, some are responsible persons of the people's administrative organs, some are women cadres who have become friends of many families in the countryside, some are people who are constantly struggling against the invaders in the occupied areas to protect the lives of the people, some have just captured several enemy mobile units, some are patriotic emulation heroes in arsenals, some are scientific workers whose laboratories are built in caves. All these men and women fight together with the people and lead them in battle.
    The National Congress is the mind of the people who are now fighting for liberation. The significance of this congress is very important, and we can clearly see that those who attended the meeting have a pure and simple temperament. This is a National Congress of the working people, a congress of brothers and sisters who are participating in production and armed struggle against the enemy. Due to their industrious way of life, sound way of thinking, and their simple Vietnamese souls, they have brought all the vitality of a growing nation here. This congress is very young and healthy, has a very diligent work spirit, and is very happy.
    This congress was filled with an intimate, joyful, sometimes noisy, and even sacred atmosphere, because this was the first time in a long time that all the people had gathered together. We are a big family headed by President Ho Chi Minh. His every opinion is a ray of light, his every action is a teaching, and his every word is an expression of love. The whole congress was filled with joy, because he was happy, and he was full of joy because he saw here the children he had educated and nurtured, who have now grown up, and the Vietnamese revolution he led has matured.
    The respect for President Ho Chi Minh is mixed with the respect for the leaders of the world's people. Under the portraits of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, hang the portraits of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong. The spirit of these world people's leaders is constantly active at the congress. More than once inspired by the spirit of proletarian internationalism, all the delegates stood up to pay their respects, expressing gratitude to the Soviet Union, the Chinese Revolution, and the French Revolution. The Congress was very pleased to feel that the relationship between the Vietnamese Revolution and the world revolution is closer than ever before, and that the world revolution is greater and more powerful than ever before. Under the shining star of the Soviet Union, our country is marching forward hand in hand with our great sister country China, the brave French people, and our Korean comrades-in-arms who are directly striking our common enemy, US imperialism. Our victorious cannons are roaring in unison with the rising tide of the peace and democracy movement. The entire Congress was bathed in an atmosphere of joy and glory. The Vietnamese Revolution will never fail the world's hopes. The Vietnamese people, closely united with the fraternal people of Laos and Cambodia, will advance side by side with the people of Southeast Asia and complete their tasks.
    Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Thorez, Premier Kim Il-sung, and the armies of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were elected as members of the honorary presidium. The Congress completed and decided on historic work. The work of the Party Congress is the work of the people and the country. All the delegates who participated in the Congress worked hard to complete their tasks and competed with each other to contribute to the common work. We discussed a political report, a program on the Vietnamese revolution, and reports on the Party's organization and regulations, the military situation, the National United Front, the people's regime, national economic construction, finance, education, ideological struggle, and the patriotic emulation movement. The Congress was intense during the days of the meeting, because the attention of all the delegates was focused on many issues that aroused debate. The discussion at the Congress was lengthy and harmonious, and during the discussion, those engaged in practical work and the soldiers worked very hard to pursue the truth.
    Comrade Trường Chinh (General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party – editor's note) delivered a document entitled "Completing National Liberation, Developing People's Democracy, and Advancing Towards Socialism," which summarized the experiences of the revolutionary movement over the past decades and pointed out the future of the people. This was the first time in history. After days of discussion on the above-mentioned document, the Congress added the views and opinions of the entire Party. In his closing speech, Comrade Trường Chinh pointed out that this was "a National Congress that summarized the experience of how to carry out the revolution and established a foundation for theory." Through struggle, action, and the practice of Marxism-Leninism, we have instilled basic political knowledge into the people, which is also the first time in our country's history. Our Party, as the vanguard of the people, is fighting alongside the people to create history and is the guide of history. Thanks to the brilliance of this Congress, Vietnamese society can see itself more clearly and decide what actions should be taken. The Vietnamese revolution is like a tireless traveler, pre-measuring a section of the long road to complete victory.
    The Congress answered the questions that the people of any country would ask themselves under the current international situation: "Is our country going to advance towards socialism? What should we do to advance towards socialism? What tasks should we complete now?" The Vietnamese working people have seen the vision of socialism, and they are convinced that socialism will bring them happiness, joy, and health, and will make their country prosperous and strong. They know that the road to socialism is through smoke and fire. In order to implement the revolution and promote social development, the Vietnamese people must crush the barbaric invaders who attempt to drag them back to the past under their feet. The tasks proposed by the Congress are: to complete the liberation of the people, directly strike the French imperialist aggressors, and expose the crimes of the American war-mongers.
    As President Ho Chi Minh said, "This Congress is first and foremost a Congress of Resistance." The Vietnamese working people are determined to put the war of resistance in the highest position, devote all their strength to the war of resistance, and continue the war of resistance until complete victory. We are not giving academic speeches at the Congress. We are only discussing practical work. What we say expresses the patriotism that is deeply rooted in our hearts. On all issues, the opinions of the People's Front are to play a decisive role. In addition to the Party's manifesto, the Congress also adopted the Congress's program, which points out the road to victory and the road to serving the motherland and the people. Thanks to this program, our united will and actions will be more consistent. With this program, our Party and people are even more masters of their own destiny, just as the soldier is the master of the gun. The Vietnamese working people are now working hard to strengthen the unity of the 20 million people of Vietnam, and will also work harder under the banner of the Party in accordance with this program to "further strengthen the National United Front and strive for complete victory." The sincere and strong will of our people has been clearly expressed in the report of Comrade Hoàng Quốc Việt (original editor's note: Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor). In order to strengthen unity and win victory, the working people of Vietnam must take the lead in implementing the Party's program. The Congress has reported, discussed, and absorbed the experience of how to carry out the revolution, and discussed the issue of building the Party into a strong, pure, and mass-based party. As President Ho Chi Minh pointed out, the Party's regulations will give it the strength necessary to "fight to the end and surely win victory." The ranks of the working people are unshakable ranks. The entire Party is inspired by the same will and determination, and every Party member is a well-trained soldier. The Party is deeply rooted in the broad masses of the people, and it is determined to become an inseparable part of the people, serving the people and fighting for the people. In order to lead the Party in the arduous struggle (this struggle will be even more arduous in the future), the Congress elected the best sons of the working class and the people – the best students of President Ho Chi Minh – to the Party's Central Executive Committee. Comrade Trường Chinh, General Secretary of the Party, received the unanimous trust of the Congress.
    The Vietnam Workers' Party had its manifesto, program, regulations, and leaders at the time of its founding.
    The Congress was convened at a time when the Central Front was about to win a victory like the Border Front, and the Congress repeatedly turned its attention to the front. Victory reports from various fronts were sent to the Congress, causing enthusiastic cheers at the Congress. The most moving scene was when the Congress welcomed the delegates who had participated in the victorious battle directly from the front, and when they bid farewell to those delegates who were called back to the fighting troops. How can we forget the moment when Comrade Hoàng Quốc Việt ran up to the podium and embraced Comrade Võ Nguyên Giáp – the old brother of the Vietnamese People's Army – who had just finished reading the military report! The Congress erupted in thunderous applause. After the applause stopped, President Ho Chi Minh stood up and praised the heroic spirit of the People's Army – the sons of the people, his sons – in extremely moving words. The Congress was extremely happy with him for the growth of the army, and proud of the theory of cultivating the true patriotism of our army. He said: "When we talk about our heroic Vietnamese army, we must think of its initial stage and its initial soldiers... It has developed from a twelve-man guerrilla team to a regular army now supported by militia and local troops of the People's Army." President Ho Chi Minh said in the applause: "This achievement is due to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism."
    President Ho Chi Minh then recounted the sacrifices made by our army and people: on the battlefield on the border, there are still traces of the heroic blood of our People's Army troops, who, in more than four days of hunger and torrential rain, held their positions and inflicted devastating blows on the enemy. He simply recounted the story of the heroic battle of a soldier of the People's Army: the soldier had a comrade cut off his seriously injured hand, and then rushed up to fight again. He recounted the tireless efforts made by the people, especially women, who volunteered to transport grain and ammunition for the army, and shared the difficulties and dangers of the front with the army. President Ho Chi Minh continued: "If all our people were not inspired by the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, how could there be such moving deeds? These people are anonymous heroes. Our people are a heroic people." Patriotic feelings were overflowing at the Congress. The Congress shouted: "Long live the heroism of the People's Armies of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia! Long live the People's Armies of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia!"
    At the Congress, the honor and responsibility of the troops were indeed great. The encouragement of the Congress will always inspire the soldiers.
    We cannot describe the great enthusiasm that permeated the Congress! We know that the war will still be long, and we will encounter new difficulties and new obstacles. But we are fully confident that we have seen victory. As a friend said: "The battle is arduous, but the revolution is great, and the future is bright."
    The enthusiasm of the Congress will spread to the Party and will expand to all the people. With the arrival of the spring of blooming flowers, the Congress will infuse fresh blood into the people and into the struggle for liberation. Due to the birth of our Party, the preparations for the general counter-offensive of our people will enter a new stage of competition, and will be carried out more actively and enthusiastically.
    In his closing speech, Comrade Trường Chinh issued the following call to the delegates:
    "The work of the Congress has been completed... After the comrades return to their localities, they should report the achievements of the Congress to all our comrades, so as to further strengthen their confidence, unity, wholeheartedness, and determination to complete the tasks entrusted to them by the Party... The resolutions of the Congress should be transformed into the invincible force of our millions of people, eliminate the invaders, and beat the French imperialists and American interventionists until they admit defeat."

　　记越南劳动党全国代表大会
    钢新
    那些能有荣幸生活在全国代表大会这划时代的日子里的人们，他们的第一个感想，就是想起那些为了革命的胜利而牺牲了自己的先烈们。正如胡志明主席所说：“他们只是少数的几个人，但是他们的决心是伟大的，他们的希望也是伟大的。他们的决心与希望，今天已经成了我们全体人民的决心与希望。”在越南民主共和国的第七年，这是一个真正的全国代表大会。
    在那些深深爱护党的劳动男女与艺术家们的创造性的手里，有一处广漠的森林已经变成了一座美丽的公园。全国代表大会会堂是一座大的、简单而又漂亮的房子。这个地方很快就要记载在历史上，正像那亲眼看到新越南诞生的新道（在河内西北一百六十公里的宣光省——原编者注）以及在数年以前庆祝越南人民解放军诞生的陈兴道森林（北越——原编者注）一样。
    大会于一九五一年二月十一日开幕。
    到会的约有来自全国各地的二百名男女代表。这次大会是一幅空前伟大的越南革命的图画。这里我们看到的有：曾经参加黑海起义的老水兵，曾在广州公社旗帜下工作的一位老同志，一位曾在义安苏维埃作战的战士，一位北山的游击队战士，一位曾在昆仑岛上的监狱里消磨了生命中一部分时光的同志，一位曾在边境前线上获得胜利的年轻的陆军指挥员。他们全都反映了我国历史上最光荣的一页。有的是曾在中越的高原上建立人民根据地的同志，有的是曾建立并保卫了南越芦苇平原的人，有的是人民行政机关的负责人，有的是已成为乡村中许多家庭的朋友的妇女干部，有的是在占领区内为保护人民的生命而与人民在一起对侵略者不断斗争的人，有的是刚刚活捉了好几队敌军机动部队的人，有的是兵工厂里的爱国主义竞赛英雄，有的是实验室建立在山洞里的科学工作者。所有这些男女们都和人民一起共同战斗，并在战斗中领导他们。
    全国代表大会是现在正为争取解放而战斗的人民的头脑。这次大会的意义非常重要，我们很清楚地看到那些参加会议的人都具有纯真质朴的气质。这是一次劳动人民的全国代表大会，是正在参加生产与对敌进行武装斗争的人民的兄弟姊妹们的代表大会。由于他们勤苦工作的生活方式、健全的思想方法、以及他们纯朴的越南人的灵魂，他们已把一个正在成长的民族的一切活力带到这里来。这次大会非常年轻而健康，具有非常勤苦的工作精神，而又非常快乐。
    这次大会充满了亲密的、快乐的、有时是喧嚷的甚至还是神圣的气氛，因为这是很久以来所有的人们第一次聚会在一堂。我们是以胡志明主席为首的一个大家庭。他的每一个意见都是一线光明，他的每一个动作都是一个教诲，他的每一句话都是一个爱的表现。整个大会都充满了快乐，因为他是快乐的，而他之所以充满了快乐，因为他在这里看到了他所教育和抚养的子弟们，现在都已成长，而他所领导的越南革命已经成熟。
    对胡志明主席的敬爱，是混合着对世界人民领袖们的敬爱的。在马克思、恩格斯和列宁的像片下面，悬有斯大林同志与毛泽东同志的像片。这些世界人民领袖们的精神，经常活跃在大会上。由于不止一次为无产阶级国际主义的精神所鼓舞，所有的代表们都起立致敬，表示感谢苏联，感谢中国革命和法国革命。大会非常高兴地感觉到：越南革命和世界革命的关系是比以前更为密切了，而世界革命也比以前更伟大、更强有力了。在苏联这颗光明的星辰照耀之下，我国正和伟大的姊妹国家中国、勇敢的法国人民、和正在直接打击我们的共同敌人美帝国主义的朝鲜人民战友们，携手前进。我们的胜利的大炮，正与和平民主运动高涨的浪潮一致地怒吼。整个大会浸浴在欢乐与荣耀的气氛中。越南革命绝不会辜负世界的希望。与老挝及柬埔寨的兄弟人民密切团结的越南人民，将与东南亚的人民并肩前进，完成他们的任务。
    斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席、多列士同志、金日成首相，以及越南、老挝与柬埔寨的军队，都被选为名誉主席团的委员。代表大会完成了并决定了历史性的工作。党的代表大会的工作，就是人民与国家的工作。参加代表大会的一切代表都努力完成他们的任务，并互相竞赛以贡献于共同的工作。我们讨论了一个政治报告，一个关于越南革命的纲领，以及关于党的组织与规章、军事形势、民族统一阵线、人民政权、国民经济建设、财政、教育、思想斗争、爱国竞赛运动等报告。代表大会在开会的几天里是紧张的，因为全体代表的注意力都集中在许多引起辩论的问题上。大会讨论得很长久很融洽，在讨论时，从事实际工作的人与战士们，都非常努力地追寻真理。
    长征同志（越南劳动党总书记——原编者注）宣读了一个题为“完成民族解放，发展人民民主，向社会主义前进”的文件，总结了数十年来革命运动的经验，指出了人民的前途，这在历史上还是第一次。对于上述文件经过多日讨论以后，大会又把全党的观点和意见加了进去。长征同志在闭幕辞中指出，这是“一个总结如何进行革命的经验并为理论建立基础的全国代表大会”。经过斗争、行动和马克思列宁主义的实践，我们已把基本的政治知识灌输给人民，这在我国历史上也是第一次。作为人民先锋队的我们的党，正和人民共同奋斗创造历史，并且是历史的指导者。借着这次代表大会的光辉，越南社会才能更明白地看清自己，并且决定应该采取什么行动。越南革命像一个不倦的行路者，预先测量着走向完全胜利的长途上一段的路程。
    代表大会回答了在目前国际形势之下任何国家的人民都一定会自问的问题：“我们的国家是不是要向社会主义前进呢？为了向社会主义前进，应该作些什么呢？现在应该完成一些什么任务呢？”越南劳动人民已经看见了社会主义的远景，并且他们确信：社会主义将给他们带来幸福、快乐和健康，并将使他们的国家兴盛而强大。他们知道：通往社会主义的道路，是要经过烽烟和战火的。为了要贯彻革命和促进社会的发展，越南人民必须把妄图将他们拖回到过去的野蛮侵略者，踏死在自己的脚下。代表大会提出的任务是：完成人民解放，直接打击法国帝国主义侵略者，并揭露美国战争贩子的罪恶。
    正如胡志明主席所说，“这次代表大会首先是抗战大会。”越南劳动人民决心把抗战置于至高无上的地位，把一切力量投入抗战中，继续抗战，直到完全胜利。我们并不是在代表大会中作学术演讲。我们只是讨论实际工作。我们所说的话，本身就表现了深深地扎根在我们心底里的爱国主义。在一切问题上，人民阵线的意见是要起决定作用的。代表大会除了党的宣言以外，又通过了大会的纲领，这项纲领指出了通往胜利的道路，为祖国及人民服务的道路。由于这项纲领，已经一致起来的我们的意志和行动将更为一致。有了这一项纲领，我们的党和人民，就更是自己命运的主人，正如兵是枪的主人一样。越南劳动人民现已在努力加强越南两千万人民的团结，还将要依据这项纲领，在党的旗帜下，更加努力，以“进一步加强民族统一战线，争取完全的胜利”。我国人民的诚恳而刚强的意志，已在黄国越同志（原编者注：越南总工会主席）的报告中明确地表示出来了。为了加强团结并赢得胜利，越南的劳动人民必须带头实施党的纲领。代表大会已报告了、讨论了、并吸收了怎样进行革命的经验，并讨论了把党建设为一个强大的纯洁的群众性的党的问题。正如胡志明主席所指出的，党的规章将给予它“战斗到底及一定赢得胜利”所必需的力量。劳动人民的队伍是动摇不了的队伍。整个党是由同一个意志和决心所鼓舞着的，每个党员都是训练有素的士兵。党深入在广大的人民群众中，它决心成为和人民血肉相关的一部分，为人民服务，为人民战斗。为了在艰苦的斗争中（这个斗争在将来还要更艰苦）领导党，代表大会把工人阶级和人民的最好的儿子——胡志明主席最好的学生，选入了党的中央执行委员会。党的总书记长征同志，受到代表大会一致的信任。
    越南劳动党在成立时就有了它的宣言、纲领、规章和首脑。
    代表大会是在中部前线正要赢得像边界前线那样的胜利的时候召开的，大会曾一再把它的注意力转向前线。各线的捷报纷纷传到代表大会，引起大会热烈的欢呼。最动人的场面，是在代表大会欢迎直接从前线来的参加过胜利战役的代表们的时候，和在送别那些奉召回到战斗部队去的那些代表们的时候。我们怎能忘记黄国越同志跑上讲台拥抱刚刚读完军事报告的武元甲同志——越南人民军的老大哥——的那一刹那呢！代表大会爆发了一阵雷动的掌声。掌声停止后，胡志明主席起立以极为动人的话，盛赞人民军——人民的儿子、他的儿子——的英雄气概。代表大会和他一道为军队的成长而极感高兴，并以培养我们军队的真正爱国主义的理论而自豪。他说：“谈到我们的英勇的越南军队，我们必须想到它的最初阶段和它的最初的士兵……它从十二个人的游击队发展到现在有民兵和人民军地方部队支持的一支正规军。”胡志明主席在掌声中说：“这个成就是由于有了马克思——列宁主义的指导。”
    胡志明主席接着追述我们的军队和人民所作的牺牲：在边境的战场上仍有我们人民军部队英雄的血迹，这些部队在四天多的饥饿和倾盆大雨中，坚守了阵地并予敌人以毁灭性的打击。他简单地追述了一个人民军战士英勇战斗的故事：这位战士让一位同志砍去他一只受重伤的手，然后又猛冲上去作战。他追述人民尤其是妇女们所作的不倦的努力，她们志愿为军队搬运粮食弹药，她们和军队分担了前线的困难和危险。胡志明主席继续说：“如果我们全体人民没有为马克思列宁主义的精神所感召，怎能有这样的动人的事迹呢？这些人是无名英雄。我国人民是英勇的人民。”爱国主义的感情洋溢在大会中。代表大会高呼：“越南、老挝、柬埔寨的人民军的英雄主义万岁！越南、老挝、柬埔寨的人民军万岁！”
    在大会上，部队的荣誉与责任的确是伟大的。大会的鼓励将永远鼓舞着战士们。
    弥漫在大会上的极大的热情，我们是无法形容的！我们知道战争仍将是长期的，我们也将会遇到新的困难与新的阻碍。但我们充分自信我们已经看到了胜利。诚如一位友人所说：“战斗是艰苦的，但革命是伟大的，前途是光明的。”
    大会的热情将传布到党里去，将扩大到全体人民里去。随着百花盛开的春天的到来，大会将以新鲜的血液灌输到人民中间去，灌输到解放斗争中去。由于我党的诞生，我们人民总反攻的准备将进入一个新的竞赛的阶段，并将更为积极而热情的进行着。
    长征同志在闭会演说中向各代表提出以下的号召：
    “大会的工作已经完毕……同志们回到各地方以后，要把大会的成就向我们全体同志们报告，好格外加强他们的信心、团结、全心全意和决心，以完成党所委托给他们的任务……要把大会的决议变为我们千百万人民的不可被战胜的力量，消灭侵略者，把法帝国主义者与美国干涉者打得承认失败。”
