To the Editor:

Some people read the newspaper, only looking at the headlines or political essays or domestic and foreign news; but they don't read the readers' letters published in the corner of the newspaper. They think the readers' letters are all small matters that can be ignored. I think this is wrong. Because the texts published in the readers' letters column are important issues discovered by the masses of readers in their actual lives. These opinions can help us correct errors and deviations in our work, enable us to learn many new things, and also inspire us to discover, recognize, and research new problems. We should read them, we should read them often.

After seeing Comrade Gu Zhongkai's "There Should Be No Enemy Characters in Yangko Teams" in the readers' letters column of the February 18th *People's Daily*, I believe that the raising of this opinion is extremely necessary and correct, and it is worthy of attention from relevant agencies and various cultural and entertainment groups. However, at the "Qinyang County's Spring Festival Literary and Art Propaganda and Celebration of the First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" held in Qinyang County on February 21st, there were still enemy characters participating in the various Yangko teams, and they were dancing triumphantly, blurring the distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and causing errors in political propaganda. I think the relevant authorities should attach importance to this issue! Don't make the same mistake again and again, repeating the error.

To the Editor:

We have seen Comrade Gu Zhongkai's criticism of us in the readers' letters column of your newspaper on February 18th, and we sincerely accept it.

After the Spring Festival Yangko team ended, we made a preliminary review and found many inappropriate things. But we did not publish it in the newspaper. Now that it has been raised by Comrade Gu Zhongkai, in addition to sincerely accepting it and making a profound review, we would also like to thank Comrade Gu Zhongkai!

　　再谈秧歌队中不应有敌人角色编辑同志：
    有些人看报，光看大标题或政治论文或国内外的消息；却不看在报角上所发表的读者信件。他们认为读者的信件都是些小事情，可以不看。我认为这是不对的。因为在读者来信栏里所刊载的文字，是读者群众在实际生活中所发现的重要问题。这些意见能够帮助我们纠正工作中的错误和偏向，能够使我们学习到很多的新鲜事物，也能够启发我们对新问题的发现、认识、与研究。我们应当看，应当经常看。
    在二月十八日的《人民日报》读者来信栏内，看到谷中凯同志写的《秧歌队中不应有敌人的角色》后，我认为这一意见的提出，是极需要和正确的，是值得各有关机关及各个文娱团体注意的。但在沁阳县于二月二十一日召开的“沁阳县各界春节文艺宣传暨庆祝中苏友好互助同盟条约签订一周年”的大会上，在各列秧歌队里，仍有敌人角色参加，并且扭得洋洋得意，弄得敌我不分，造成政治宣传上的错误。我认为有关机关，应把这一问题重视起来！不要一错，再错，重复地错误下去。
                                  沁阳省立中学附属小学  石磊编辑同志：
    我们已看到二月十八日贵报读者来信栏内，谷中凯同志对我们的批评，我们诚恳地表示接受。
    春节秧歌队结束后，我们曾作了初步检讨，发现有许多不妥之处。但我们没有在报纸上发表。今既由谷中凯同志提出，我们除万分诚意地接受与作深刻检讨外，并向谷中凯同志致谢！
