The Democratic Progressive Association, the China Zhi Gong Party, and the Jiusan Society
    Vehemently Denounce MacArthur's Absurd Remarks

    [This newspaper report] The China Association for Promoting Democracy, China Zhi Gong Party and the Jiusan Society issued written statements on March 29, denouncing the outrageous remarks of the chief culprit of American imperialist aggression, MacArthur. They all expressed their utmost anger at MacArthur's threat to expand the war of aggression to our territory.
    A spokesman for the China Association for Promoting Democracy pointed out in a statement: "The world has long recognized MacArthur, this demon, as a defeated general under the hands of the Chinese and Korean people. His most despicable and shameless repeated ravings have all gone bankrupt one by one. Now that this demon is dizzy with fantasy as our army takes the initiative to withdraw from Seoul, he is here again boasting wildly. The result will inevitably be the same as in the past – bankruptcy. It’s really not worth a knowing person's smile. MacArthur's shameless rant thoroughly exposes the ferocious face of the American aggressors and further proves that the U.S. imperialism’s deliberate plan to invade China is absolutely true, which cannot but arouse the close attention of the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country must heighten their vigilance, strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, and we will never stop until we drive the aggressors who are intent on invading our country out of Korea." It also stated: "The Chinese people were confident in defeating Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and today they are even more confident in defeating the American aggressors together with their Korean brothers."
    The China Zhi Gong Party sternly condemned the war-monger MacArthur's insane statement in a written statement. It stated: "He thinks that such a clamor can scare the Chinese people, but he has forgotten that the Chinese people who have stood up cannot be frightened or defeated. On the other hand, he pretends to be willing to negotiate an armistice on the battlefield, feigning a hypocritical mask of love for peace. We want to warn him that the Chinese people who have stood up cannot be deceived either. We are determined to continue to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and at the same time, we have the confidence and certainty to completely drive all invading forces out of Korea. MacArthur's crazy statement is just another instance of boasting gone bankrupt."
    The written statement issued by the Jiusan Society stated: "The Chinese people will never tolerate this kind of insult, and they will never be intimidated by any absurd remarks of imperialist war-mongers." The statement called on the members of the society to always remember the humiliation inflicted on our country by the British and American aggressors, to use all their strength to support the Chinese and Korean people's forces on the Korean front, to completely eliminate the British and American aggressors, to avenge our Korean brothers and sisters, and to avenge our compatriots across the country. It stated: "Each of our members must further strengthen the propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in their own work posts, and respond to all imperialist aggressor criminals with more powerful patriotic actions."

    痛斥麦克阿瑟狂言
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会、中国致公党和九三学社，分别于三月二十九日发表书面谈话，痛斥美帝国主义侵略罪魁麦克阿瑟的无耻狂言；并一致对麦克阿瑟要把侵略战争扩大到我国领土的恫吓，表示切齿的愤怒。
    中国民主促进会发言人在谈话中指出：“麦克阿瑟这个恶魔，世人早已认识他是中朝人民手下的败将，他的最卑鄙无耻的一再的梦呓，都早已一一破了产。现在这个恶魔趁着我军主动撤离汉城之际，给幻想冲昏了头脑，又来大吹其牛，那结果亦必然像过去一样地破产，实在是不值识者一笑的。麦克阿瑟的无耻狂言，彻底暴露了美国侵略者的凶狠面貌，再度证明了美帝国主义蓄意侵略中国的计划一些不假，不能不使我全国人民加以密切的注意。我全国人民务须提高警惕，加强抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争，非把蓄意侵略我国的侵略者赶出朝鲜，决不罢休。”并称：“中国人民过去有把握战胜日本帝国主义和国民党反动派，今天更有把握和朝鲜兄弟一同战胜美国侵略者。”
    中国致公党在书面谈话中严厉斥责了战争贩子麦克阿瑟的疯狂声明。并称：“他以为这样的叫嚣可以吓倒我们中国人民，他却忘记了已经站起来了的中国人民，是吓不倒的，也打不倒的；另方面，他又佯称愿在战地谈判停战，伪装一付爱好和平的假面目。我们要警告他，已经站起来了的中国人民也是骗不了的。我们决心要继续抗美援朝，同时，有把握、有信心将一切侵略势力彻底赶出朝鲜。麦克阿瑟这种疯狂声明只是又一次吹牛的破产。”
    九三学社发表的书面谈话称：“中国人民决不能容忍这种侮辱，也决不会被帝国主义战争贩子的任何狂言妄语所吓倒。”谈话号召该社社员永远记住美英侵略者所给予我国的侮辱，用一切力量支援朝鲜前线的中朝人民部队，彻底消灭美英侵略势力，为朝鲜兄弟姊妹复仇，为全国同胞复仇。并称：“我们每一个社员要在自己的工作岗位上更进一步加强抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，用更有力的爱国行动来答复一切帝国主义的侵略罪犯。”
