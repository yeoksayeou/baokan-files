Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 16th: The meeting of the four Deputy Foreign Ministers continued on March 15th, chaired by British representative Davies.

At the March 14th meeting, Soviet representative Gromyko had once again revised the first and third items of the Soviet draft agenda and expressed willingness to accept the three countries' proposal "on the question of restoring German unity and preparing a peace treaty." On the 15th, even the reactionary Parisian newspaper *Le Figaro* admitted that there had been progress in the meeting, and said that this progress "should be attributed to the Soviet representative."

However, at the March 15th meeting, the representatives of the Western countries still took a negative attitude towards the new wording suggested by the Soviet Union.

U.S. representative Jessup said that he could not accept the issue of reducing the armed forces of the four countries, his argument being that the issue of reducing the armed forces of the four countries was related to all countries. He also expressed opposition to the proposal on eradicating German militarism to implement the Potsdam Agreement, and tried to portray the three countries' measures to arm West Germany as "defensive."

Jessup, representing the three Western countries, put forward a new proposal, attempting to use it to replace the two proposals put forward by the Soviet Union. The new proposal of the three countries stipulated the study of the causes of the current tense situation in Europe, and the necessary measures to achieve a genuine and lasting improvement in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France, such as: the issue of existing levels of armaments and their impact on the eradication of German militarism, and methods of controlling and reducing armaments; measures to eliminate the fear of aggression, and fulfilling existing treaty obligations.

In his speech, British representative Davies admitted that the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the last meeting would indeed move the work of the meeting forward a big step, but he still opposed the Soviet proposal on eradicating German militarism to implement the Potsdam Agreement.

In his speech, Gromyko refuted Jessup's claim that the reduction of troops was related to all countries. He pointed out that disarmament obviously cannot start with small countries like Luxembourg and Haiti. Gromyko also pointed out that the measures taken by Western countries in West Germany have nothing in common with defense. These measures grossly violated the Potsdam Agreement.

Gromyko said that he could not agree that the new proposal of the three countries should replace the Soviet proposals on eradicating German militarism and reducing the armed forces of the four countries with meaningless and vague wording.

The next meeting was held on March 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 17th: The meeting of the four Deputy Foreign Ministers continued on March 16th, chaired by Soviet representative Gromyko.

The French and British representatives spoke first at the meeting. They defended the new proposal on the agenda put forward by U.S. representative Jessup on behalf of the three Western countries at the March 15th meeting, and tried their best to conceal the true essence of the wording of this proposal, namely: avoiding important international issues, and trying to forcibly confirm that it was in line with the Soviet delegation's proposal. French representative Parodi even insisted that their wording expressed the opinions of the Soviet proposal. British representative Davies attempted to put pressure on the Soviet delegation. He insisted that the Soviet Union's negative attitude towards the three countries' proposals gave reason to doubt whether the Soviet Union really hoped to successfully conclude this meeting.

Soviet representative Gromyko then spoke, and he thoroughly analyzed the proposals of the three Western delegations, thereby proving that: despite various assurances, the proposals of the three Western delegations were essentially unrelated to the proposals of the Soviet delegation.

Gromyko said: Although the wording of the three Western countries' proposals also mentioned the two issues of eradicating German militarism and reducing armaments; in fact, the three delegations had reduced these two issues to nothing, and replaced them with the issue of "armament levels." The purpose of the wording of the three countries' proposals was not to implement the eradication of German militarism, but to obstruct this work. Although the three countries' proposals allowed discussion of the issue of reducing armaments, their purpose was not to reduce armaments, but to increase armaments and strengthen the arms race.

Gromyko pointed out: If the three delegations really agreed that the Foreign Ministers' meeting should discuss the two issues of eradicating German militarism and reducing the armed forces of the four countries, then they would not oppose including the issues raised by the Soviet delegation on the agenda. However, the fact that the three delegations disagreed with these issues shows that they understood that the purpose of their wording was completely different from that of the Soviet delegation.

Gromyko continued: Not only the words of the three representatives, but also the actions of the three representatives proved that: they had no intention of preparing to discuss the issue of reducing the armed forces of the four countries. The measures being implemented by the Western countries to remilitarize West Germany proved this point.

Gromyko refuted Davies's claim that the Soviet delegation's rejection of the three countries' proposals proved that it was unwilling to reach an agreement, saying: Everyone knows that it was the Soviet government, not the British government, that proposed convening the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and put forward concrete proposals for the agenda of this conference. In order to strive for an agreement, the Soviet delegation had made several changes to its draft agenda. However, the agenda wording proposed by the three delegations in response to this step by the Soviet delegation did not consider the most important issues raised by the Soviet delegation. Davies also said that the three delegations had made the greatest concessions on the agenda wording. This means: either you accept our proposal, or there is no mutually agreed agenda. On this point, I would like to remind Davies that in some meetings, such as the North Atlantic Alliance Council meeting in Brussels, this language may be appropriate, but in negotiations with the participation of Soviet representatives, this language is inappropriate. The agenda we must formulate must be the result of the reconciliation of the positions of the countries participating in the meeting, and not a certain condition put forward by Britain or any group of countries.

Gromyko concluded: The new wording of the three countries' proposals was unsatisfactory and did not solve the problem. The Soviet delegation cannot hide the essence of the issues of fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eradicating German militarism and reducing the armed forces of the four countries behind the various vague and meaningless wordings proposed by the three representatives.

After U.S. representative Jessup spoke to defend the wording of the three delegations' proposals, the meeting adjourned and the next meeting was scheduled for March 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18th: The meeting of the four Deputy Foreign Ministers continued on March 17th, chaired by U.S. representative Jessup.

In their speeches, the representatives of the Western countries continued to defend the proposals they put forward at the March 15th meeting regarding the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' meeting, and intended to cancel the Soviet draft agenda's proposals for implementing the Potsdam Agreement on eradicating German militarism and reducing the armed forces of the four countries. French representative Parodi even reversed the facts, disregarding that the agenda draft put forward by the Soviet Union contained concrete and urgent issues, and insisted that the Foreign Ministers' meeting could only conduct discussions aimed at "propaganda." In his speech, British representative Davies shamelessly said that the Soviet delegation's proposals would hinder the three countries from implementing measures to rearm West Germany. He also stated that no agenda could change Britain's policy on this issue.

In response to the speeches of the three representatives, Gromyko severely criticized the three Western representatives for using unfounded and contradictory arguments to deliberately refuse to accept the essence of the two issues in the Soviet proposals—eradicating German militarism and reducing the armed forces of the four countries. Regarding Parodi's speech, Gromyko pointed out: Whenever there is unwillingness to adopt the Soviet Union's proposals aimed at consolidating peace, the myth of "propaganda" is used as a magic weapon. In the United Nations General Assembly, the Security Council, and other United Nations agencies, this magic weapon has been repeatedly used against Soviet representatives. However, eradicating German militarism is an extremely serious issue, and it is not possible to describe it as "propaganda." The solution to this issue is of great significance to maintaining international peace.

Gromyko pointed out: Davies's statement about the Soviet proposals hindering Western countries from rearming West Germany, and Jessup's statement of the same nature at the March 16th meeting, were very frank statements. They openly admitted that the Western countries intend to continue to implement the policy of rearming West Germany while discussing the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. Gromyko said: The Soviet government condemns this policy, which violates the Potsdam Agreement and aims to undermine peace and launch another war. In order to maintain peace and for the fundamental interests of the people of Europe and the German people themselves, German militarism must be eradicated and its resurgence prevented. This is the reason why the Soviet delegation suggested that this issue be included in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. However, when we accepted the main suggestion of the three countries, according to their own wording, to include the causes of the tense situation in Europe on the agenda, the three representatives resisted including the Soviet suggestions on eliminating German militarism and reducing the armed forces of the four countries on the agenda.

The next meeting was scheduled for March 19th.

### 四国外长助理会议继续举行  葛罗米柯揭露美、英、法武装西德阴谋   戴维斯等竟反对苏联关于履行波茨坦协定的议案

    四国外长助理会议继续举行
    葛罗米柯揭露美、英、法武装西德阴谋
    戴维斯等竟反对苏联关于履行波茨坦协定的议案
    十五日会议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：四国外长助理会议于三月十五日继续举行，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。
    在十四日会议上，苏联代表葛罗米柯曾经再度修改了苏联议程草案中的第一、第三项议案，并表示愿意接受三国“关于恢复德国的统一与准备和约的问题”的议案。十五日，甚至巴黎的反动报纸《费加罗报》也承认会议有进展，并说这种进展“应归功于苏联代表”。
    但是，在十五日会议上，西方国家的代表，对于苏联建议的新措辞仍然采取否定的态度。
    美国代表耶塞普表示不能接受裁减四国军队的问题，他的论据是因为裁减四国军队的问题和一切国家都有关系。他也表示反对关于肃清德国军国主义以履行波茨坦协定的议案，并力图把三国武装西德的措施说成是“防御性”的。
    耶塞普代表西方三国提出了新的建议，企图用它来代替苏联提出的两项议案。三国新建议规定研究造成目前欧洲局势紧张的原因，以及为达到苏联与美、英、法之间的关系真正而持久的改善所必需的措施，例如：现有的军备水平问题，这种军备水平对肃清德国军国主义问题的影响，以及管制和裁减军备的办法；消除对侵略的恐惧的措施，履行现有的条约义务等问题。
    英国代表戴维斯在发言中承认，苏联代表团在上次会议上提出的议案确实会使会议的工作迈进一大步，但是他却仍然反对苏联所提关于肃清德国军国主义以履行波茨坦协定的议案。
    葛罗米柯在发言时，驳斥了耶塞普所说裁减军队与各国都有关系的说法。他指出，裁军显然不能从卢森堡、海地这样的小国开始。葛罗米柯也指出，西方国家在西德所采取的措施与防御毫无共同之处。这些措施粗暴地违反了波茨坦协定。
    葛罗米柯表示不能同意，三国新建议以无意义而含混的措辞来代替苏联关于肃清德国军国主义和四国裁减军队的议案。
    下次会议于三月十六日举行。
　　十六日会议
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十七日讯：四国外长助理会议于十六日继续开会，由苏联代表葛罗米柯任主席。
    法英两国代表在会议上首先发言。他们辩解十五日会议上美国代表耶塞普代表西方三国所提出的关于议程的新建议，竭力掩饰这一建议的措辞的真实本质，即：避而不谈重要的国际问题，并图牵强附会地证实它是与苏联代表团的提案相吻合的。法国代表巴罗第竟硬说他们的措辞表达了苏联建议的意见。英国代表戴维斯企图对苏联代表团施以压力。他硬说：苏联对三国建议所持的否定态度，使人有理由怀疑苏联究竟是否希望成功地结束这次会议。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯随后发言，他透彻地分析了西方三国代表团的建议，从而证明：尽管有种种保证，但是，西方三国代表团的建议在本质上却与苏联代表团的建议毫无共同之处。
    葛罗米柯说：尽管西方三国建议的措辞中也提到肃清德国军国主义及裁减军备两项问题；但是，事实上，三国代表团已把这两个问题化归乌有，而代之以关于“军备水平”的问题。三国建议的措辞的目的，不是为了执行肃清德国军国主义，而是要阻挠这种工作。三国建议虽然允许讨论裁减军备问题，但其目的不是裁减军备，而是增加军备和加强军备运动。
    葛罗米柯指出：假如三国代表团真正同意外长会议讨论肃清德国军国主义和裁减四国军队这两个问题，那么，它们就不会反对把苏联代表团所提出的问题列入议程。但是，三国代表团不同意这些问题，由此可以看出他们了解他们的措辞的目的是和苏联代表团迥然不同的。
    葛罗米柯继称：不但三国代表们的言辞，而且三国代表们的行动也证明了：他们根本就没有打算准备讨论关于裁减四国军队的问题。西方国家所正在实施的使西德重新军国主义化的措施就证明了这一点。
    葛罗米柯驳斥戴维斯硬说苏联代表团拒绝接受三国的建议、证明它不愿意获致协议的说法称：大家知道：是苏联政府而不是英国政府提出了召开四国外长会议的问题，并为这个会议议程提出了具体建议。苏联代表团为了力求获致协议，曾对它的议程草案作了若干更改。但是，三国代表团在回答苏联代表团的这个步骤时所建议的议程措辞，却并不考虑苏联代表团所提出的最重要的问题。戴维斯还说，三国代表团在议程措辞上已作了最大的让步。这就是说：要么你们接受我们的建议，要么就没有大家同意的议程。关于这一点，我要请戴维斯注意，在某些会议上，象在布鲁塞尔北大西洋联盟理事会会议上，这种语言或许是适当的，但是，在有苏联代表参加的谈判中，这种语言就是不适当的了。我们必须拟订的议程，一定要是参加会议各国的立场调和的结果，而不是由英国或任何国家集团所提出的某种条件。
    葛罗米柯最后说：三国建议的新措辞是不能令人满意的，而且没有解决问题。苏联代表团不能把履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定和裁减四国军队这样的问题的实质，藏在三国代表所建议的各种含糊和无意义的措辞后面。
    在美国代表耶塞普发言辩护三国代表团建议的措辞后，会议即行休会，下次会议定于十七日举行。
　　十七日会议
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：四国外长助理会议于十七日继续开会，由美国代表耶塞普任主席。
    西方国家的代表们在发言中继续辩护他们在十五日会议上所提出的关于外长会议议程的建议，并打算取消苏联议程草案中履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定与裁减四国军队的议案。法国代表巴罗第竟颠倒事实，不顾苏联提出的议程草案包含着具体紧迫的问题，硬说外长会议将只能进行旨在据以“宣传”的讨论。英国代表戴维斯在发言中无耻地说，苏联代表团的建议将妨碍三国执行重新武装西德的措施。他并且表示：不论什么议程都不能改变英国在这个问题上的政策。
    葛罗米柯在答复三国代表的发言中痛斥西方三国代表利用毫无理由和前后矛盾的论据，别有用心地拒绝接受苏联建议中的两项问题——肃清德国军国主义和裁减四国军队——的实质。葛罗米柯就巴罗第的发言指出：凡是在不愿采纳苏联以巩固和平为目标的建议的场合，“宣传”的神话就被当作如意法宝来用。在联合国大会、安全理事会和其他联合国机构中，这种法宝曾一再被用来对付苏联代表。但是，肃清德国军国主义是一个极其严肃的问题，把它说成“宣传”是不行的，这个问题的解决对维持国际和平有着重大的意义。
    葛罗米柯指出：戴维斯关于苏联建议妨碍西方国家进行重新武装西德的发言和耶塞普在十六日会议上同样性质的发言，是十分坦白的说法。他们公开承认：西方国家打算在讨论外长会议议程的时候，继续执行重新武装西德的政策。葛罗米柯说：苏联政府谴责这种违反波茨坦协定、旨在破坏和平和发动另一次战争的政策。为了维持和平，为了欧洲各国人民和德国人民自身的基本利益，必须肃清德国军国主义并防止其再起。这就是苏联代表团建议把这一问题列入外长会议议程的原因。然而，当我们按照三国自己的措辞接受三国将关于欧洲紧张局势的原因列入议程的主要建议的时候，三国代表却抗拒将苏联关于肃清德国军国主义和裁减四国军队的建议列入议程。
    下次会议定于三月十九日举行。
