	CCP Jixian County Committee Propaganda Minister Liu Xiaojian's Self-Criticism on Suppressing Criticism.
	The CCP Jixian County Committee Decides to Launch a Study of Criticism and Self-Criticism Throughout the County.

To the Editors:

	The article "CCP Jixian County Committee Propaganda Minister Unprincipledly Attacks Critics," published in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on March 6th, gave me a great inspiration and education.

	Why did Comrade Fan Weijun believe that I was protecting the cadres of Loutou Village and adopting an attitude of attacking him? The main reason is that I did not understand the spirit of criticism and self-criticism sufficiently, and my understanding of the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" was inadequate. I did not realize that "conducting criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications is a necessary method to consolidate the Party's ties with the people, ensure the democratization of the Party and the country, and accelerate social progress." I mistakenly believed that writing critical articles stemmed purely from personal grievances, and I also feared that village cadres would stop working if they were criticized. At the time, I said to Comrade Fan Weijun: "The village cadres have made mistakes, but is it wrong for you to exaggerate the facts in your writing?" In my words, I emphasized finding the shortcomings of the critic and relaxed my scrutiny of the village cadres' mistakes, failing to grasp the principles and objectively recognize the problem. This not only prevented the critic from receiving political support but, on the contrary, subjected him to censure. My view on this issue was completely wrong.

	In the future, I will earnestly study the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," utilize the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and overcome shortcomings in my work. In addition to continuing to conduct deep self-examination, I will also assist Comrade Feng Deshui, the Secretary of the Second District Committee (erroneously written as Hu Shoudong in the original manuscript of March 6th - Editor), and other comrades in studying this decision of the Party Central Committee well, correcting erroneous thoughts, and further helping village cadres examine errors in their work.
					Liu Xiaojian, Propaganda Minister of the CCP Jixian County Committee, Hebei

To the Editors:

	After seeing the article in the "Letters from Readers" section of your newspaper on March 6th exposing Comrade Liu Xiaojian, the Propaganda Minister of the CCP Jixian County Committee, for suppressing criticism, we immediately convened the cadres of the County Committee Office and the Propaganda Department for detailed reading and discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that Comrade Fan Weijun's criticism was correct and should be encouraged and supported. In addition to having Comrade Liu Xiaojian make a public self-criticism, I plan to personally go to the Second District on the 13th and 14th of this month to assist the district cadres in understanding the situation in Loutou Village and handling this issue; we will promptly inform you of the results of the handling.

	In addition, in order to establish a style of criticism and self-criticism among Party cadres at all levels throughout the county, we plan to combine the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," Comrade Fan Weijun's written article, and Comrade Liu Xiaojian's self-criticism to conduct a study and launch a discussion, so that everyone can correctly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism.

     中共冀县县委会宣传部长刘晓建对压制批评的自我检讨
    中共冀县县委会决定在全县展开批评与自我批评的学习编辑同志：
    三月六日贵报“读者来信”栏所载“中共冀县县委宣传部长无原则的打击批评者”一稿，给了我一个很大的启示和教育。
    为什么使樊维钧同志认为我袒护垒头村干部，对他是打击态度呢？主要是由于我对批评与自我批评的精神领会不够，对党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”认识不足。没认识到“在报纸刊物上进行批评和自我批评是为了巩固党与人民群众的联系，保障党和国家的民主化，加速社会进步的必要方法。”错误地认为写批评稿件是单纯从私人闹意见出发，同时又怕村干部受了批评不干工作。当时我就对樊维钧同志说：“村干部有错误，你写的夸大事实是否是错误？”在言语上偏重了找批评者的缺点，放松了村干部的错误，而没有掌握原则，冷静客观地去认识问题。这样不仅使批评者得不到政治上的支持，相反的受到责难。我对这一问题的观点，是完全错误的。
    今后我一定要认真学习党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，运用起批评和自我批评的武器，克服工作中的缺点。除了我继续作深刻检讨外，还要协助二区区委书记冯德水（三月六日原稿中误为胡守栋——编者）等同志很好地学习党中央这一决定，纠正错误的思想，进而帮助村干部检查工作上的错误。
         中共河北冀县县委会宣传部长  刘晓建编辑同志：
    见到三月六日贵报“读者来信”内披露了中共冀县县委宣传部长刘晓建同志压制批评的稿子以后，我们当即召集了县委办公室与宣传部的干部，详细阅读与讨论。大家一致认为樊维钧同志提出的批评是对的，应该予以鼓励与支持。除了让刘晓建同志作公开的检讨外，我准备于本月十三、四日亲自去二区协助区干部到垒头村了解情况，处理这一问题；处理结果当迅速告诉你们。
    此外，为了在全县各级党员干部中树立起批评与自我批评的作风，我们准备以党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，结合樊维钧同志所写稿件及刘晓建同志的检讨，进行一次学习，并展开讨论，以使大家正确地掌握批评和自我批评的武器。
