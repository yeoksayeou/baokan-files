Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 18th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on February 19th that the Vietnam Workers' Party issued a declaration to the people of Vietnam.

The declaration first pointed out that the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union is becoming stronger than the imperialist war camp led by the United States, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people stand on the side of the democratic camp. French colonialists, with the full assistance of American imperialists, are plundering our land. Our people are determined to fight to defend our land and homes, and are preparing for a general counter-offensive at an early date.

The declaration stated: The strength of our resistance comes from the people. More than 90% of our people are working people, including workers, farmers and intellectuals. Therefore, working people are the main driving force for our armed resistance and national construction.

The central task of the Vietnamese working class and working masses at present is to unite all the people to carry the war of resistance to complete victory, to establish an independent, unified, democratic and prosperous Vietnam, to fully realize people's democracy, so as to advance towards socialism. In order to accomplish this task, the Vietnamese working class and working people must have a vanguard, a general staff, a strong, wise, resolute, pure and thoroughly revolutionary party: the Vietnam Workers' Party.

The Vietnam Workers' Party will include the most patriotic, most enthusiastic, and most revolutionary workers, peasants and intellectuals. It will include those who are determined to serve the motherland, serve the people, serve the working class, put the interests of the whole people above personal interests, and play an exemplary role in the war of resistance and national construction.

The Party's theory is the theory of Marxism-Leninism. The Party's organizational principle is democratic centralism. The Party's discipline is strict and conscious discipline. The purpose of the Party's policy is to serve the interests of the country and the people. The law of the Party's development is criticism and self-criticism.

The main task of the Vietnam Workers' Party at present is to unite and lead the Vietnamese working class, working masses and all the people to fight together, eliminate the French colonialists and defeat the American interventionists, achieve complete victory in the Vietnamese People's Liberation War, and make Vietnam a truly independent and unified country.

The Vietnam Workers' Party fully supports the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and closely unites and cooperates with the parties and groups within the Viet Minh Front (Vietnam National United Front) in order to fully implement the people's democratic system in politics, economy, society and culture.

The Vietnam Workers' Party advocates safeguarding the legitimate interests of people of all strata.

The Vietnam Workers' Party advocates paying special attention to improving the material and spiritual life of the army, who are fighting the enemy to defend the country and are enduring the greatest hardships.

Workers are production fighters in enterprises, and they must have the opportunity to continue to improve their living conditions and participate in the management of their own enterprises.

Farmers are production fighters in the countryside, and they must benefit from rent reduction, interest rate reduction and reasonable land reform.

Intellectuals must be encouraged and assisted to develop their talents.

Small merchants and small owners must be assisted to develop commerce and handicrafts.

Enterprises run by the national bourgeoisie must be encouraged, assisted and guided to benefit the development of the national economy.

Patriotic landlords should be guaranteed their right to collect rent according to law.

Minority nationalities should be given full assistance and made fully equal in rights and obligations.

Women must be given effective assistance to achieve equality between men and women.

Believers of all religions shall enjoy freedom of belief.

Overseas Vietnamese must be protected.

The lives and property of foreigners in Vietnam should be protected. Especially Chinese expatriates, if they wish, should be allowed to enjoy the same rights and fulfill the same obligations as Vietnamese citizens.

In terms of diplomacy, the Vietnam Workers' Party advocates that the Vietnamese people should closely unite with the people of Cambodia and Laos, help them in their struggle for independence, and jointly liberate the entire Indochina; actively support the national liberation movement of oppressed people; closely unite with the Soviet Union, China and other people's democratic countries; closely unite with the French people and the people of French colonies, and participate in the struggle against imperialism to defend world peace and democracy.

The declaration calls on the Vietnam People's Army, workers and farmers to actively launch competitions to annihilate the enemy and increase production. At the same time, the declaration calls on compatriots at home and abroad to unite closely around the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the leader of the Vietnamese working class and the working masses - President Ho Chi Minh.

The declaration concludes by pointing out that the Vietnam Workers' Party believes that with the efforts and support of all party members, male and female working people and all the people, the Party will surely be able to accomplish the following tasks: to achieve complete victory in the liberation war; to develop the people's democratic regime; to contribute to the defense of world peace and democracy; and to lead the Vietnamese people towards socialism.
