Editor's Note: The first repayment of principal and interest for the 1950 First Issue People's Victory Discount Public Bonds was conducted via a public lottery held in Beijing on February 1st, with redemption stipulated to begin on March 31st. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government announced the methods for repayment of principal and interest of public bonds on January 29th. Bondholders have raised many questions regarding specific redemption procedures, all of which the People's Bank of China has answered individually. To address the questions of the vast number of public bondholders nationwide, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China has compiled the following comprehensive explanation based on questions raised over the past two months and anticipated issues.

	I. Question: How can I verify the winning numbers for public bond repayment?
	Answer: Verifying the numbers involves comparing the last two digits of the number printed on your purchased public bond (whether it's one fen, ten fen, one hundred fen, or five hundred fen) with the two digits of the announced winning numbers. If they match, then you have a winning bond. For example, if the first round of winning numbers are 06, 11, 24, 33, 49, 55, 61, 75, 84, and 96, then any bond with the last two digits matching one of these ten numbers is a winning bond for the first repayment round and can be redeemed for principal and the first interest payment. If the last two digits do not match any of these ten numbers, then the bond has not won in the first repayment round and can only be redeemed for the first interest payment, not the principal.

	II. Question: What is the total redemption period for public bond repayment and interest payment?
	Answer: The repayment of principal for winning bonds in the first round and the payment of the first interest coupon will take place from March 31, 1951, to September 30, 1951. If redemption is not completed within this six-month period, it can be carried out during the supplementary redemption period from March 31 to September 30 of each year from 1952 to 1955. In effect, redemption is possible within the six months from March 31 to September 30 each year from 1951 to 1955. Furthermore, any unpaid principal and interest coupons from all periods will be paid from October 1, 1955, to March 31, 1956. If they are still not claimed by then, the redemption period will not be extended.

	III. Question: If the first round of winning bonds and the first interest coupon are not redeemed after March 31, 1951, but are redeemed as late as March 1952 or the final March 1956, will interest be added for the period from April 1, 1951, until the actual redemption date?
	Answer: Once a public bond is drawn for repayment, interest will no longer be calculated from the day following the start of the repayment date. For example, if the first round of winning bonds for principal repayment begins on March 31, 1951, then interest will be paid up to March 31, 1951. The interest coupons attached to the original bond, expiring on March 31 of the years 1952 to 1955, will no longer be redeemed and should be surrendered along with the bond when redeeming the principal. Because the principal has been repaid, no further interest should be paid. The extended redemption period is to accommodate bondholders who may not notice the winning numbers early or are too busy with work to redeem them promptly. However, the government prefers that bondholders redeem the principal and interest due as soon as the redemption period begins.

	IV. Question: If the first round of winning bonds and the first interest coupon are redeemed late, in March 1952 or March 1956, what will be the exchange rate used for conversion?
	Answer: The People's Victory Discount Public Bond Regulations stipulate that the repayment of principal and interest will be paid in Renminbi according to the discount amount per fen (i.e., the public bond price) announced by the People's Bank of China at the time of payment. This public bond price is calculated and announced every ten days. Bondholders, regardless of when they redeem within the specified redemption period, will have their bonds converted based on the public bond price for the ten-day period in which they redeem.

	V. Question: How are the principal and interest of winning bonds and the first interest payment of non-winning bonds redeemed?
	Answer: (1) All redemptions must be made by filling out an application form at local branches of the People's Bank of China and submitting it along with the bond for verification. (2) Whether redeeming principal and interest for winning bonds or redeeming interest for non-winning bonds, the entire bond sheet must be submitted to the bank for verification. Do not detach the interest coupons yourself.

	VI. Question: If a winning bond is damaged but can be pieced together as a whole sheet, is it still valid?
	Answer: Even if a bond is damaged, if it can be pieced together to form more than one-half of the whole sheet, the number is complete, and the face value can be identified, it can be submitted to the bank for verification and repayment of principal. However, if any of the second to fifth interest coupons are missing, they will be deducted from the principal, and the bank will issue a certificate of missing coupons for record-keeping. If the bondholder finds the missing coupons, they can present them to the original redemption bank along with the certificate for verification and a refund of the deducted amount.

	VII. Question: If an interest coupon is not detached but is damaged, is it still valid?
	Answer: If the degree of damage to an interest coupon is less than one-third and the period and face value can be identified, it can be submitted to the bank for verification and redemption. If the degree of damage is more than one-third, it will not be redeemed to prevent irregularities.

	VIII. Question: If a winning bond is damaged but the interest coupons are intact, is it still valid?
	Answer: Damaged bonds will be handled according to the answer in VI above. The attached interest coupons, if intact, can be submitted to the bank for verification and redemption along with the damaged bond.

	IX. Question: The repayment of principal and interest on public bonds is managed by the People's Bank of China. However, in rural and remote areas where there are no branches of the People's Bank, and bondholders are unable to travel to cities for redemption, how can they redeem their bonds?
	Answer: The Head Office of the People's Bank of China has notified all levels of banks to utilize mobile savings teams and agricultural loan teams to conduct on-site redemption of public bonds in rural or remote areas. If necessary, specialized teams will be formed to carry out on-site redemption work. Before redemption, local township governments will be asked to notify the masses to complete redemption on schedule. This is the current method. In the future, as the People's Bank expands its organization and establishes more branches and offices, redemption will become even more convenient.

	X. Question: If public bonds purchased in Xinjiang are brought outside Xinjiang Province or to the Northeast, how can the winning principal and first interest coupon be redeemed?
	Answer: Public bonds issued in Xinjiang are marked with the words "Xinjiang" and will be repaid at the public bond price announced by Xinjiang every ten days. If the purchaser takes the bonds outside Xinjiang Province or to the Northeast, the People's Bank branches in Lanzhou, Xi'an, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the Joint Office of the People's Bank of Shanhaiguan and the Northeast Bank have been designated as agent paying banks. If the bondholder is in one of these locations, they can present the whole bond sheet directly for redemption. If they are outside these five locations and Shanhaiguan, they can also take the bond to the local People's Bank or Northeast Bank to be forwarded for redemption, but the calculation will be based on the public bond price for the ten-day period in which the agent paying bank receives the bond.

	XI. Question: If public bonds issued outside Xinjiang Province and the Northeast are brought into Xinjiang Province or the Northeast, how can the winning principal and first interest coupon be redeemed?
	Answer: If public bonds issued outside Xinjiang Province and the Northeast are brought into Xinjiang Province or the Northeast, the People's Bank of Dihua and the Joint Office of the People's Bank of Shanhaiguan and the Northeast Bank have been designated as agent paying banks. If the bondholder is in Dihua or Shanhaiguan, they can present the whole bond sheet directly for redemption. If they are outside Dihua and Shanhaiguan, they can also take the bond to the local People's Bank or Northeast Bank to be forwarded for redemption, but the calculation will be based on the public bond price for the ten-day period in which the agent paying bank receives the bond.

	XII. Question: If the People's Victory Discount Public Bond (including those issued in Xinjiang) is brought to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, how can the winning principal and first interest coupon be redeemed?
	Answer: If the above bonds are brought to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Zhangjiakou Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Bank has been designated as the agent paying bank, and the various levels of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Bank will temporarily act as forwarding banks. Bondholders can submit the bond to any branch of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Bank to be forwarded for redemption and calculated based on the public bond price for the ten-day period in which the agent paying bank receives the bond.

　　中国人民银行总行关于公债还本付息的几个问题的答复
    编者按：一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债第一次还本付息已于二月一日在北京举行公开抽签，并规定自三月三十一日开始兑付。关于公债还本付息办法，中央人民政府财政部曾于一月二十九日公布。惟公债持有人对具体兑付手续等曾提出很多问题，均经中国人民银行逐一答复。为了解答全国广大持有公债群众的疑问，中国人民银行总行特根据两月来先后提出的问题及估计可能发生的问题作了下面的综合解释。
    一、问：公债还本中签号码怎样核对？
    答：号码的核对就是把所买得的公债票（不论是一分、是十分、是一百分、是五百分）上所列号码最末尾的两个字与公布的中签两个字的号码核对。如果是相同的即是中签。如第一次中签号码是０６、１１、２４、３３、４９、５５、６１、７５、８４、９６十个，若是所买的债票上号码最末尾的两个字与上列十个号码中的一个相同的，就是第一次中签债票，可以领取本金及第一期利息。如果与这十个号码没有一个相同的，就是第一次还本未中签的债票，只能向银行领取第一期利息，不能领取本金。
    二、问：公债还本付息兑取的期限共有若干时间？
    答：第一次中签债票的还本和第一期息票的付息，都是自一九五一年三月三十一日起至同年九月三十日止为兑付期间。在这六个月的期间内如果还未兑取，就要等到一九五二至一九五五年的三月三十一日起至九月三十日补行兑付。实际上就是自一九五一年至一九五五年每年在三月三十一日至九月三十日的六个月内都可兑付。同时并自一九五五年十月一日起至一九五六年三月三十一日止补付所有各期未付的本息票。倘届时仍不领取，即不再延期兑付。
    三、问：第一次中签债票及第一期到期息票，如在一九五一年三月三十一日开始兑付后不来兑取，直等到一九五二年或最后一九五六年三月才来兑取，是否加给一九五一年四月一日以后至实际兑取时的利息？
    答：公债一经中签还本，即在开始还本的日期之次日起不再计息。即如第一次中签还本的债票是一九五一年三月三十一日开始兑付本金，则债票的利息即付至一九五一年三月三十一日为止，原债票上所附带的一九五二年至一九五五年三月三十一日到期的息票不再兑付，并在兑取本金时应一并随同缴销。因本金既还清，就不应再给利息。至于兑付期限定得很宽，是照顾公债持有人，恐其未能早日注意中签号码，或因工作忙无暇兑取。但在政府方面是情愿持有人在开始兑付时即将应得本金及到期利息如数兑去。
    四、问：第一次中签债票及第一期到期息票如迟至一九五二年或一九五六年三月兑取，是照何时牌价折算？
    答：人民胜利折实公债条例规定：还本付息按付款时中国人民银行公布每分之折合金额（即公债牌价）以人民币支付之。此项公债牌价每十日计算公布一次。持有人在所定兑付期限内，不论何时兑取，即按兑取日当旬的公债牌价折算。
    五、问：中签债票的本息及未中签债票的第一期利息如何兑取？
    答：（一）一律向各地中国人民银行填写申请书连同债票交验兑取。（二）中签债票取本息及未中签债票取利息都要将全张债票交银行查验，万勿将息票自行剪下。
    六、问：中签债票如有破损，但可拼凑成张，是否有效？
    答：债票虽破损，如可拼凑在全张二分之一以上，号码完整面额分数能以辨认者，送交银行查验兑付本金。但第二至第五期息票如有短缺，应在本金内扣除，由银行填给短缺息票证明书存查。如持票人寻获所缺息票，可连同证明书到原兑付行请求查验，并退还原扣款额。
    七、问：到期息票虽未剪下，但已残破，是否有效？
    答：息票残破程度如在三分之一以下，期次分数能以辨识者，可送交银行验兑。倘残破程度在三分之一以上，则不予兑付，以防流弊。
    八、问：中签债票残破，但到期息票完整，是否有效？
    答：债票残破，照前列第六答案办理。其附带的到期息票如属完整，可一并送交银行验兑。
    九、问：公债还本付息由中国人民银行经理，农村及边远地区尚未设有人民银行办事机构，而公债持有人又无暇远赴城市兑取的，如何办理？
    答：中国人民银行总行已通知各级行，对于农村或边远地区的公债还本付息，由各地人民银行利用流动储蓄小组及农业贷款小组等前往就地兑付。必要时并组专门小组前往办理就地兑付工作。在兑付之前，先请当地区乡政府通告群众定期办理兑付，这是现在的办法。今后人民银行扩充机构，分支行处普遍设立，那时更可便利兑取了。
    十、问：在新疆购买的公债携到新疆省外或东北的，其中签的本金及第一期息票的利息如何兑取？
    答：新疆发行的公债印有“新疆”二字字样，应照新疆每旬公布的公债牌价付还本息。如果购买人带往新疆省外或东北的，已指定兰州、西安、北京、天津、上海五地人民银行及山海关人民银行东北银行联合办事处为代付行。持有人如在上列各地，可持全张债票迳请兑付，如在该五地及山海关以外者，亦可持往就地人民银行或东北银行转为兑取，但要按代付行收到债票日的当旬牌价计算。
    十一、问：在新疆省及东北以外发行的公债，如果购买人带往新疆省内或东北的，其中签的本金及第一期息票的利息如何兑取？
    答：新疆省及东北以外发行的公债，如果购买人带往新疆省内或东北的，已指定迪化市人民银行及山海关人民银行东北银行联合办事处为代付行。持有人如在迪化或山海关者，可将全张债票迳请兑付，如在迪化及山海关以外者，亦可持往就地人民银行或东北银行转为兑取，但要按代付行收到债票日的当旬牌价计算。
    十二、问：人民胜利折实公债（包括新疆发行者）如携到内蒙古自治区时，其中签债票的本金及第一期息票的利息如何兑付？
    答：上项债票如携到内蒙古自治区，已指定张家口内蒙古自治区人民银行为代付行，并暂以内蒙古自治区人民银行各级行为转办行。持有人可将债票交由内蒙古自治区人民银行中任何一行转为兑取，并按代付行收到债票日的当旬牌价计算。
