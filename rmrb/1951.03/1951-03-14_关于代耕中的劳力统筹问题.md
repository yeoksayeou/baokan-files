　　On the Problem of Labor Coordination in Mutual Aid Farming

　　Question: The instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on strengthening mutual aid farming work state: "Mutual aid farming should be carried out by agricultural labor and animal power in rural areas, in principle based on the village or district as a unit, and the method of unified planning at the county level should not be adopted rashly." Please explain: Does this unified planning refer to labor coordination or material coordination?

　　Answer: Labor coordination and material coordination are actually the same thing. In short, it means using the village, township, or district as a unit to uniformly calculate the labor required for mutual aid farming, in order to achieve fairness and reasonableness in the burden of mutual aid farming. It is generally referred to as labor coordination.

　　Question: If labor coordination is implemented, according to our district's experience, it is difficult even to use the township as a unit, let alone the district. It is not only inconvenient to transfer labor from Village A to Village B, which are three to five miles apart, to help with farming, but it also wastes labor. We wonder if our understanding is correct?

　　Answer: It is inconvenient and wasteful to transfer labor from Village A to Village B for mutual aid farming, and the results are not significant, so it should not be adopted. When implementing labor coordination, the difference between households within a village, or the difference between villages within a township or district, can generally be compensated with grain. That is, if Household A participates in more mutual aid farming work and Household B participates in less, Household B should provide grain to Household A; if Village A participates in more mutual aid farming work and Village B participates in less, Village B should provide grain to Village A, to achieve a balanced burden.

　　Question: Is the method of unified planning for mutual aid farming grain being tested in the Dezhou area universally applicable?

　　Answer: In areas where there are not too many and not too concentrated families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, especially in new areas, it is feasible to collect mutual aid farming grain according to the labor force that should perform mutual aid farming, and then hand it over to those who should enjoy mutual aid farming to hire workers or as remuneration. However, it is not suitable for implementation in mountainous areas, disaster areas, and areas where the masses have little grain but a lot of idle labor. In areas where unified planning for mutual aid farming grain is implemented, attention should also be paid to the following points: (1) The scope of unified planning should be small, and the township as a unit is sufficient. If the scope of unified planning is too large, it is easy to develop village-level localism, which is difficult to control. (2) Mutual aid farming is a social mutual assistance behavior between the masses and the families of martyrs and soldiers, and the masses should be constantly educated to understand the meaning and role of mutual aid farming. This alternative method of collecting mutual aid farming grain should be voluntary on the part of the masses and should be discussed and decided upon at the township people's representative conference, and managed by a special committee under the leadership of the township people's government.

### 关于代耕中的劳力统筹问题

　　关于代耕中的劳力统筹问题
    问：中央人民政府内务部加强代耕工作的指示中说：“代耕由农村从事农业生产的劳力畜力执行，原则上以村，或以区为单位，不应冒然采用以县为单位的统筹办法”。请问：这里所说的统筹是指的劳力统筹还是指的物力统筹？
    答：所谓劳力统筹或物力统筹实际上是一回事。总之是以村、乡、或以区为单位，统一计算应服代耕的劳力，以求代耕负担的公平合理。一般的通称为劳力统筹。
    问：如实行劳力统筹，根据我区经验，别说以区为单位，即以乡为单位，也是有困难的。从相隔三、五里的甲村拨工到乙村去帮耕，不仅工作上有很多不便，而且也浪费了劳力。我们的认识不知是否正确？
    答：甲村拨工到乙村去代耕，工作不便且浪费劳力，收效不大，不应该采用。在实行劳力统筹时，以村为单位的户与户之间的差额，或以乡、区为单位的村与村之间的差额，一般可以用粮食来偿付。即甲户参加代耕的工多，乙户参加代耕的工少，乙户即应找给甲户粮食；甲村参加代耕的工多，乙村参加代耕的工少，乙村即应找给甲村粮食，以求负担平衡。
    问：德州地区试行统筹代耕粮的办法是否可以普遍推行？
    答：在革命烈士家属和革命军人家属不太多且不集中的地区，特别是在新区，按应服代耕的群众劳力收集代耕粮，然后交给应享受代耕者去雇工，或作为报酬的办法，是可以试行的。但在山地、灾区及群众粮食不多，而闲余劳力不少的地区，则不宜实行。在实行统筹代耕粮的地区，亦应注意下列各点：（一）统筹的范围要小，以乡为单位即可。统筹范围大了，容易发生村本位现象，不好掌握。（二）代耕是群众和烈、军属的社会互助行为，应经常教育群众了解代耕的意义和作用。这种收集代耕粮的变通办法，要出于群众的自愿，并应在乡人民代表会议上讨论决定，由在乡人民政府领导下的专门委员会来管理。
