　　Soviet Union at the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East
    Proposes Inviting Our Representative to Attend
    Proposal is Rejected by Representatives from the United States, Australia, and Others
    [Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, 5th] According to TASS, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its seventh session in Lahore on February 28th.

    At the afternoon session, the head of the Soviet delegation, Nemchina, requested that the Kuomintang representatives be expelled from the meeting and that representatives of the People's Republic of China be invited to attend. The Soviet delegation submitted a proposal to this effect.

    The Soviet delegation's proposal was put to a vote. Representatives of five countries – the Soviet Union, India, Burma, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom – voted in favor; eight countries, including the United States, Australia, France, Thailand, and Kuomintang elements, voted against it.

    Nemchina issued a statement on this point, saying: "The Soviet representative deems it necessary to state that the Committee's decision to reject the Soviet proposal to expel the Kuomintang representatives and not to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the seventh session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is incorrect and illegal, because the representatives of the People's Republic of China are truly qualified to participate as Chinese representatives in the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East."

　　苏联在联合国远东经委会上
    提议邀请我代表出席
    提案竟被美、澳等代表否决
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社拉合尔二日讯：联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会于二月二十八日在拉合尔举行第七次会议。
    苏联代表团团长涅姆钦纳在下午的会议上要求将国民党代表逐出会议，并邀请中华人民共和国的代表前往出席。苏联代表团并为此提出了提案。
    苏联代表团的提案被提付表决。五国代表——苏联、印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦和英国的代表——投赞成票；八个国家，包括美国、澳大利亚、法国、泰国和国民党分子等投反对票。
    涅姆钦纳就这一点发表声明称：“苏联代表认为必须声明，委员会所通过的否决苏联关于开除国民党代表的提案、并不邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表出席联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第七次会议的决议，是不正确而且不合法的，因为中华人民共和国的代表是真正有资格参加联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会的中国代表。”
