　　Experiences in Holding Public Security Exhibitions in Various Places

　　Public security exhibitions are one of the best ways to publicize the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and expose the crimes of special agents.

　　In recent months, public security organs in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Jinan, Shantou, and Xining have successively held large-scale or small-scale public security exhibitions. According to incomplete statistics, the audience at these exhibitions has reached over 2.2 million people.

　　The audience received the most vivid and profound education at the public security exhibitions, and universally strengthened their hatred and vigilance against the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents. The audience also clearly saw the achievements of the people's public security work and the strength of the people's public security forces. Many viewers expressed a general willingness to assist public security organs in eliminating bandits and special agents. The audience in Guangzhou earnestly put forward more than a hundred suggestions to the city's public security bureau on preventing spies and eliminating special agents. After seeing the National Public Security Exhibition, many cadres in Beijing discussed and formulated measures to prevent special agents and maintain confidentiality. Within three days, the public security organs in Xining City, Qinghai Province, received more than a dozen letters from citizens reporting and exposing the crimes of bandits and special agents. Some exhibitions, especially those held in conjunction with local current public security work, have played a role in educating the deceived masses, coerced elements, and promoting work. The Beijing Yiguandao Crime Evidence Exhibition is a good example. Many Yiguandao followers, after seeing the exhibition, realized that "planchette writing" and the "Three Treasures" were all deceptive tricks, and recognized that Yiguandao was a reactionary organization that deceived the masses to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. More than 170,000 followers in Beijing quickly withdrew from Yiguandao, and the exhibition played a role in promoting this.

　　The main experiences of holding public security exhibitions in various places are:

　　(1) Public security exhibitions can be roughly divided into two types: one is a large-scale comprehensive exhibition, which systematically and comprehensively exhibits all aspects of public security work, and has a great educational effect. However, this type of exhibition is often limited by manpower, material resources, time, and other conditions, and cannot be held frequently. The other is a small-scale special or thematic exhibition (Beijing and Tianjin have held several times), which is to exhibit materials of a major case or a specific issue in coordination with current work. The advantage is that the publicity is timely, it is easier to hold, and it is convenient for touring exhibitions. The disadvantage is that the exhibition content is not comprehensive. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and can be adopted according to needs and objective conditions.

　　(2) The exhibition should focus on the current public security work situation, the characteristics of the enemy situation, and the ideological state of the masses, and clearly solve one or several main problems. For example, in the work of banning Yiguandao, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that many followers and citizens did not understand the crimes of Yiguandao in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, and many followers were deeply superstitious about the deceptive tricks such as "planchette writing" and the "Three Treasures." Therefore, the Yiguandao Crime Evidence Exhibition focused on exhibiting the criminal facts of Yiguandao defrauding the masses and carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, and used repentant Sancai (planchette writers) and Diantranshi (initiators) to perform "planchette writing" and transmit the "Three Treasures" in public, nakedly exposing these deceptive tricks.

　　(3) Physical objects, photos, familiar cases, especially the "personal accounts" of self-rehabilitated special agents or reactionary secret society members, are most welcomed by the audience and have the greatest effect. For example, after seeing the American flag secretly prepared by Zhang Zhenchuan, a Diantranshi of Yiguandao, and the Kuomintang flag found in the home of Zhao Junfu, the altar head, the citizens of Beijing generally said angrily: Hmph, they still expect the American devils and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to come back and oppress us!

　　(4) The exhibition materials should have a beginning and an end, the titles and explanatory texts should be appropriate, the font should be upright and generous, and the photos should be large and clear. During the exhibition, sufficient explainers should be provided to help the audience (especially workers and peasants) understand the exhibition content. Explainers must first have a clear understanding of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, public security work, or case details; secondly, they must be good at explaining in different ways according to different audiences (such as explaining in more detail to those with low education levels; guiding students and intellectuals to read the written explanations).

　　各地举办公安展览会的经验
    公安展览会是宣传镇压反革命政策和揭露特务罪恶的好方法之一。
    最近几个月来，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、济南、汕头、西宁等城市公安机关，曾先后举办了大型或小型的公安展览会。据不完全统计，各地展览会观众已达二百二十万人以上。
    观众们在公安展览会中受到了最生动最深刻的教育，普遍加强了对美蒋特务分子的仇恨与警惕。观众们也清楚地看到了人民公安工作的成绩和人民公安力量的强大。许多观众普遍表示要协助公安机关肃清土匪、特务。广州市观众恳切地向该市公安局提出百余条防止奸细，肃清特务的意见。北京市许多机关干部看过全国公安展览后，回去即讨论制订了防止特务和保密办法。青海省西宁市公安机关三天内即收到市民群众控告、检举土匪、特务罪行的信件十多封。有的展览会，特别是配合当地当前公安工作所举办的展览，更起了教育被骗群众、胁从分子和推动工作的作用。北京市一贯道罪证展览会是一个很好的例子。许多一贯道徒看过展览后，知道“扶乩”、“三宝”都是骗人的鬼把戏，认清了一贯道是欺骗群众进行反革命活动的反动组织。北京市十七万多道徒迅速退出一贯道，展览会是起了推动作用的。
    各地举办公安展览会的经验主要是：
    （一）公安展览大致可分为两种：一种是大型的综合性的展览，把公安工作的各个方面都较有系统、较全面地展览出来，教育作用很大。但这种展览会往往受人力、物力、时间等条件的限制，不可能经常地举办。一种是小型的专案或专题展览（北京、天津已举办过数次），就是配合当前工作，把一个重大案件或专门问题的材料展览出来。优点是宣传及时，举办也较容易，又便于巡回展览。缺点是展览内容不全面。二者各有短长，可以根据需要与客观条件采用。
    （二）展览会要针对当前公安工作情况、敌情特点和群众思想状况，明确解决一个或几个主要问题。如北京市公安局在取缔一贯道工作中，了解到很多道徒和市民不明白一贯道进行反革命活动的罪行，许多道徒对“扶乩”、“三宝”等鬼把戏迷信极深。于是一贯道罪证展览会便集中展览了一贯道诈骗群众，进行反革命活动的罪恶事实，并用悔悟较好的三才（乩手）、点传师当众表演“扶乩”和传“三宝”，赤裸裸地揭穿了这些骗人鬼把戏。
    （三）实物、照片、群众熟悉的案件，特别是自新特务分子或反动会道门分子的“现身说法”，最为观众欢迎，收效也最大。如北京市市民群众看过一贯道点传师张镇川秘密准备的美国旗和从坛主赵俊福家中搜出的国民党旗帜之后，普遍愤恨地说：哼，他们还指望美国鬼子和蒋匪帮回来压迫我们呢！
    （四）展览的材料要有头有尾，标题、说明文字要恰当，字体要端正大方，照片要大而清楚。展览期间要配备足够的说明员帮助观众（特别是工农群众）了解展览内容。说明员必须首先对镇压反革命政策、公安业务或案情了解得很明确；其次要善于根据不同的对象用不同的方式讲解（如对文化水平低的，讲详细些；对学生、知识分子就引导他们看文字说明。
