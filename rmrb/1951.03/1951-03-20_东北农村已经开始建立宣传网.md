　　In many rural areas of Northeast China, Communist Party propaganda networks have already been established, playing a significant role in publicizing current events and policies, and promoting agricultural production. This shows that in the vast countryside, provided there is a Party foundation, it is possible to establish Party propaganda networks.

　　Among the rural areas of Northeast China, Heilongjiang Province has developed relatively extensive propaganda networks. In Zhaodong County, the province has 239 administrative villages, only 16 of which have not established propaganda networks; in Zhaoyuan County, 99 out of 198 administrative villages have established propaganda networks, with a total of 1,065 propagandists. Other provinces also have propaganda networks in rural areas. In Qianqi Village, Lalin County, Songjiang Province, there are 19 propagandists for 580 households; in Juren Village, Bin County, there are 18 propagandists for 382 households.

　　The Party branches in many counties' rural areas have accomplished much through the work of propagandists. At the time of the outbreak of the Korean War, the peasant masses in Minzhu Village, Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, were ideologically confused due to a lack of clear understanding of the current situation, and their enthusiasm for production was not high. After active publicity and mobilization by the propagandists, they understood the direction of the development of the current situation. Last winter, their enthusiasm for sideline production was very high. Up to now, the village has earned a total of 923.6 million Northeast currency, and has added 18 carts, 4 horses, and 1 cow, laying a good foundation for this year's spring plowing production. Rural propagandists are actively working in preparing for spring plowing production. Yang Fa, a propagandist from Anju Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang, seized the time to test planting before the start of spring plowing. As a result, the bad bean seeds did not sprout, so he showed them to everyone, which aroused the whole village's attention to seed selection. Liu Yuzhang, a propagandist from Shuangquan Village, Xiuyan County, discussed organizing mutual aid teams with other farmers as early as the third day of the lunar new year, and went up the mountain to collect firewood on the fifth day, which made those who planned to "play around in the first month and make trouble in the second month" anxious, and promoted the spring plowing preparation work of the whole village. In order to respond to the government's call to expand the planting area of cash crops, the sixteen propagandists in Zhaotun Village, Beizhen County, Liaoxi made efforts to publicize and explain to the masses during the Spring Festival. Propagandist Wang Shuqing said: "Our land here is alkaline, and kenaf loves to grow. This thing is not afraid of a little flooding (the village is often flooded). If you grow it well, you can strip more than one hundred catties per mu. Good hemp can be exchanged for twelve catties of sorghum per catty, which is more cost-effective than growing sorghum. In this way, our people can become prosperous and live a good life, and the country will have industrial raw materials. It's really killing two birds with one stone!" His residential group, a total of twenty-four households, planned to expand the planting area of hemp by ten mu after his publicity, and is now actively preparing seeds and fertilizers.

　　Due to the establishment of propaganda networks, publicity work has had a powerful effect in rural areas, making many Party members and cadres in rural areas have a new understanding of propaganda work. Cheng Wanshan, secretary of the Party branch of Minzhu Village, Wuchang County, said: "No matter what work it is, if you don't do a good job of publicity beforehand, and you don't understand the masses' thoughts, the work will not be done well!" Cao Fengshan, secretary of the Party Committee of the Eleventh District of Zhaodong County, said: "If you lead the propagandists well, all work will be easy to complete." Precisely because they recognized the effect of publicity work, many rural cadres changed their past style of coercion and command, and adopted methods of mobilization and persuasion.

　　东北农村已经开始建立宣传网
    东北的许多农村，已经建立了共产党的宣传网，在宣传时事政策和推动农业生产上，起了很大的作用。这说明在广大农村，只要有党的基础，是可以建立党的宣传网的。
    东北农村中党的宣传网，以黑龙江省发展得较为广泛。该省肇东县二百三十九个行政村，只有十六个行政村没有建立宣传网；肇源县一百九十八个行政村中，就有九十九个行政村建立了宣传网，共有一千零六十五名宣传员。其他各省农村也都有宣传网。松江省拉林县前棋村，五百八十户人家，就有十九名宣传员；宾县居仁村，三百八十二户人家，就有十八名宣传员。
    许多县份农村的党的支部，经过宣传员作了许多工作。朝鲜战争爆发时，松江省五常县民主村农民群众因对时局认识不清，思想混乱，生产劲头不大，经过宣传员积极的宣传鼓动，了解了时局发展的方向，去年冬天搞副业生产的劲头很大，到现在为止，全村共收入东北币九亿二千三百六十万元，添置了十八台大车、四匹马、一头牛，为今年春耕生产打下良好的基础。在准备春耕生产中，农村宣传员都积极活动。黑龙江肇东县安居村宣传员杨发，开春前抓紧时间试种，结果坏豆种不出芽，他便端给大家看，引起全村对选种工作的重视。岫岩县双泉村宣传员刘玉章，旧历大年初三便找别的农民讨论组织伴工组，初五就上山打柴，使得那些打算“耍正月，闹二月”的人都着了急，推动了全村的春耕准备工作。辽西北镇县赵屯村十六名宣传员为了响应政府号召，扩大经济作物的耕种面积，春节期间努力向群众宣传解释。宣传员王树青说：“咱们这里是碱地，种洋麻爱长，这玩艺涝一点（该村常遭水灾）也不怕。种好了一亩能扒一百多斤。好麻一斤换十二斤高粱，比种高粱合算多了。这样，咱们老百姓发家致富过好日子，国家又有了工业原料，真是一举两得！”他们居民小组共二十四户，经他这一宣传，计划扩大种麻面积十亩，现在正积极准备籽种和肥料。
    由于宣传网的建立，宣传工作在农村中发生了威力，使得农村中许多党员干部对宣传工作有了新的认识。五常县民主村党支部书记程万山说：“不管啥工作，事先不宣传好，群众思想不摸底！工作就做不好！”肇东县十一区党的区委书记曹凤山说：“把宣传员领导好了，啥工作都好完成。”正因认识到了宣传工作的效果，许多农村干部改变了过去的强迫命令作风，而采取动员说服的方法。
