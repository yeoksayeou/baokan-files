　　Conscientiously Carry Out This Year's Spring Water Conservancy Project

　　The large-scale spring water conservancy project of 1951 is about to begin. This project is of great significance to this year's agricultural production and the safety of people along the rivers. Party and government leading organs at all levels should attach great importance to it and devote sufficient strength to support this work. In some areas, water conservancy projects should be regarded as the central work for a certain period.

　　Last year's spring water conservancy project achieved great results. However, due to hasty preparations and lack of experience, many shortcomings occurred, resulting in considerable serious losses and waste. Although the major administrative regions and provincial water conservancy work conferences, and the national water conservancy conference have successively reviewed this, there have been phenomena of repeating past shortcomings in winter repairs. Now, the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government has issued instructions in response to these shortcomings, requesting the strengthening of project planning, increasing efficiency, improving quality, and avoiding losses and waste, so that the 1951 project can be improved on the basis of last year. Local leading organs should check their work based on this instruction and, in conjunction with the specific local conditions, carefully study improvement methods. Here, a few key issues will be specifically explained.

　　The first is how to properly combine spring repairs with spring plowing. According to the scale of this year's spring repair project, the total number of mobilized migrant workers nationwide should be at least over five million. In the spring, mobilizing such a huge labor force, how to combine spring repair and spring plowing well to solve the contradiction in labor allocation has become the primary issue in mobilization. In solving this problem, first of all, it is necessary to carry out publicity and explanation in coordination with the project plan, explaining the consistency of interests between spring repair and spring plowing in production. Without good water conservancy projects, agricultural production will lack guarantee, so as to overcome the ideological obstacles of "difficult to balance" among cadres and the masses. In non-disaster areas, it is especially necessary to break the masses' paralysis about possible water and drought disasters, and therefore their lack of concern for water conservancy projects. Secondly, it is necessary to carefully decide the number of migrant workers to be mobilized according to various conditions. On this issue, the local masses often worry about delaying spring plowing and planting, and require frequent shifts to shorten the working time for each person. Or they request to increase the number of mobilized people in order to quickly complete the spring repair project. However, according to actual experience, this is not an economical method. Because after the migrant workers arrive at the construction site, it always takes some time to arrange their lives and become familiar with the work. If more people are mobilized than actually needed for the project due to a blitz, resulting in a shorter construction period, the overall average efficiency will be reduced, and management difficulties will increase. Migrant workers mobilized from afar need time to travel, and if the construction period is too short, greater waste will inevitably occur. In the North Liu Tang River diversion project of the Subei Yi River diversion project in the past winter, the total amount of earthwork was 3.43 million cubic meters, and the actual number of migrant workers was over 126,000, with an average of only 27 cubic meters per person. The funds used for sheds, travel expenses, and rain work subsidies, even if evenly distributed to each cubic meter, would be more than one catty of grain. As a result, some counties experienced overdrafts of work grain on the one hand and losses for migrant workers on the other. Therefore, each region must carefully consider the number of migrant workers to be mobilized based on project needs, cadre situation, construction site size, tool preparation, mobilization scope size, and distance, to ensure that the project is completed on time and to avoid waste of manpower and material resources. The most important and fundamental method is to establish mutual aid organizations, organize labor by village, work according to fields, or work according to labor, so that the cadres and masses at home and the cadres and masses who go to work can divide their work, help each other, and guarantee each other, so as to achieve the purpose of not delaying both spring repair and spring plowing. In areas with a large number of workers, efforts should be made to mobilize women to participate in agricultural production to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor.

　　The second is the wage issue. This is also an important issue in migrant worker mobilization and project leadership. This year, the migrant workers participating in water conservancy work still have the nature of semi-obligatory labor, but the wage standard can still guarantee enough food and compensation for the consumption of migrant workers' clothing and tools, and as long as the work efficiency can reach a general level, there can also be a small amount of surplus. Therefore, in dealing with the wage issue, on the one hand, we must carry out extensive publicity and explanation to enlighten the masses' awareness of semi-obligatory labor. On the other hand, we must also try to improve work efficiency in the organization and leadership of the project to ensure that the migrant workers "have enough to eat and have something to gain." Regarding this point, the Ministry of Water Conservancy has already proposed in its instructions to adhere to the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, which is an important key to solving the wage problem. Because piece-rate wages are superior to daily wages in terms of stimulating labor enthusiasm, it is an undeniable truth. All construction units must overcome all difficulties to ensure the thorough implementation of this system. According to last year's experience, there are several difficulties and obstacles in the implementation of this system, which must be completely overcome this year. The first is the cadres' ideological concerns, because the piece-rate wage system is a more detailed work, and some cadres have a fear of trouble. Therefore, some areas still implement daily wages, and some areas, although implementing piece-rate wages, still adopt the "equal distribution" method within the team or group. This wage egalitarianism reduces work efficiency and makes wages that could have been sufficient become insufficient, ultimately causing greater difficulties. These lessons must be learned. Of course, piece-rate wages also have some practical difficulties, such as insufficient surveyors, inability to survey and account in time, or work grain is not controlled by the project organs, and the surplus grain obtained by migrant workers cannot be distributed in time. These problems will make the piece-rate wage system lose its clear meaning, thus reducing its effectiveness in stimulating production. These difficulties must also be solved this year. In the Huai River management project in Henan and northern Anhui in the past winter, surveyors were trained in advance, and migrant worker representatives jointly surveyed. For the Chaobai River project in North China, the Tangshan Special District paid the surplus wages of migrant workers other than food in Renminbi, surveyed and paid on time, which are all good experiences. In short, those who lead water conservancy projects must not regard the wage issue and surveying and grain distribution as simple administrative work, but must regard it as an important work in leading migrant workers, and it is a crucial work in motivating migrant workers' labor enthusiasm and improving migrant workers' labor efficiency. We must attach importance to this, and in conjunction with political propaganda and mobilization work, we can lead the migrant workers well.

　　In addition, doing a good job in preparatory work is another key to doing a good job in the spring repair project. A large part of the errors and wastes that occurred in last year's spring repairs were due to preparations that were not detailed, not factual, and not thorough. This year, we must pay close attention to planning to avoid repeating past mistakes. In this regard, the errors committed last year can be roughly classified into the following types: One is that the project plan is too large, the number of mobilized people is too large, and the cadre allocation, administrative preparations, etc. cannot keep up; one is that the project plan is not mature, and the project is temporarily changed or added, resulting in passivity; one is that the leadership does not grasp the preparatory work tightly, does not adequately estimate various unexpected difficulties, or lacks investigation and research, and the estimated situation does not match the actual situation, resulting in panic and difficulty; in individual projects, there have even been unfortunate phenomena of a large number of migrant workers getting sick and even dying, which is an unforgivable mistake. Among them, lack of experience, and lack of detailed preparation and organization are relatively common shortcomings. In response to these shortcomings, the Ministry of Water Conservancy has already issued detailed instructions, and in addition to conducting thorough inspections according to specific circumstances, each region should currently focus on two aspects: One aspect is the mobilization and organization work mentioned earlier, which should lay a good foundation from the mobilization of the masses. The other aspect is the preparation of technical and administrative matters, such as the transportation and preparation of grain and materials, the measurement and alignment of the project, the division of work sections, the layout of the construction site, and the arrangement of migrant workers' food and accommodation, to ensure that construction can start on time.

　　In short, millions of migrant workers participating in the spring water conservancy project is a very big thing. Time is very tight. I hope that the cadres and people in the relevant areas will mobilize, bravely take on this huge task, work hard, and strive to overcome floods, avoid disasters, protect production, and strive for greater harvests.

### 认真作好今年水利春修工程

　　认真作好今年水利春修工程
    一九五一年大规模的水利春修工程就要开始了。这个工程对今年的农业生产和沿河人民的安全，具有重大的意义，各地党政领导机关都应给以高度重视，拿出足够的力量支持这一工作，有些地区在一定时期内并且需要把水利工程看作是中心工作。
    去年的水利春修工程，成绩很大。但是因为准备仓促，经验不足，也曾发生许多缺点，造成相当严重的损失浪费。虽然先后经过各大行政区及各省水利工作会议，和全国水利会议的检讨，但在冬修中仍有重复过去缺点的现象发生。现在中央人民政府水利部又针对这些缺点发布指示，要求加强工程的计划性，增加效率，提高质量，避免损失浪费，使一九五一年的工程能在去年的基础上提高一步。各地领导机关应当根据这个指示，检查自己的工作，并结合地方具体情况，详细研究改进的办法。这里特就其中几个关键性的问题，加以说明。
    首先是春修与春耕如何适当结合问题。根据今年春修工程的规模，全国动员民工的总额，至少当在五百万人以上。在春季，动员这样巨大的人力，怎样使春修与春耕很好地结合，以解决人力分配上的矛盾，便成为动员当中首要的问题。在解决这个问题当中，首先要配合工程计划进行宣传解释，说明春修与春耕在生产上利益的一致性，不修好水利工程，农业生产便缺乏保障，以克服干部和群众在思想上“难于兼顾”的障碍。在非灾区，尤其要打破群众对于可能的水旱灾害的麻痹因而不关心水利工程的思想。其次，要根据各种条件，慎重决定需要动员民工的数量。在这个问题上，当地群众往往因为顾虑耽误春耕播种，要求勤换班，以缩短每人工作的时间。或者是要求增加动员人数，以图迅速突击完成春修工程。但是，根据实际经验，这是不经济的办法。因为民工到工地后，安排生活，熟悉工作，总要费去一些时间。若因突击而动员了超过工程实际需要的人数，因而使工期过短，也都会使总的平均效率降低，而且增加管理上的困难。远地动员的民工，来往需时，若工期过短，必然发生更大浪费。去冬苏北导沂附属工程中的北六塘河改道工程，土工总计三百四十三万公方，实到民工十二万六千余人，平均每人仅做二十七公方，其用于工棚、路费、雨工津贴的经费，即使每公方平摊一斤粮以上，以致各县发生一方面工粮透支及另一方面民工亏累的现象。所以各地区对于动员民工的数量，必须根据工程需要、干部情况、工地广狭、工具准备、动员范围大小和距离远近等条件慎重考虑，一方面要保证工程按时完成，另一面，要避免人力物力的浪费。而最重要最根本的办法，还是要建立互助组织，以村为单位把劳力组织起来，按田出工，或按劳出工，使在家的干部群众，与出工的干部群众，分工互助，互相保证，以达春修春耕两不耽误的目的。在出工多的地区应着重发动妇女参加农业生产，以解决劳力不足的困难。
    其次是工资问题。这也是民工动员和工程领导中的重要问题。今年参加水利工作的民工，仍带有半义务劳动的性质，但是工资的标准，仍然可以保证够吃和补偿民工衣服工具的消耗，并且只要工作效率能够达到一般水平，还可有少量的剩余。因此我们对于工资问题的处理，一方面要进行广泛的宣传解释，以启发群众对于半义务劳动的自觉自愿，另一面，还必须在工程的组织领导上，尽量设法提高工作效率，以保证民工“有吃有得”。关于这一点，水利部的指示中已经提出，要坚持执行按方给资的工资制度，这正是解决工资问题的重要关键。因为计件工资，在启发劳动情绪上优于计日工资，已经是无待证明的真理。各施工单位，必须克服一切困难，以保证这一制度的彻底实施。根据去年的经验，在实施这一制度中有几种困难和障碍，今年必须彻底加以克服。首先是干部思想上的顾虑，因为按方给资制度是较细致的工作，部分干部存在着怕麻烦的思想，所以个别地区仍有实行计日工资的，有的地区虽然实行按方给资，可是在中队或小组之内仍然采取“平摊”的办法，这种工资上的平均主义，都使工作效率降低，使本来可以够吃的工资变成了不够吃，最后造成更大的困难，这些教训必须记取。当然，按方给资也有一些实际困难，如收方人员不够，不能及时收方算账，或者是工粮不由工程机关掌握，民工所得的余粮不能及时发放，这些问题都将使按方给资的制度失去了它的明确意义，因之减低了它刺激生产的效能。这些困难，今年也必须设法解决。去冬河南皖北治淮工程，都曾事先训练收方人员，并由民工代表共同收方。对于华北潮白河工程，唐山专区对民工食用以外的剩余工资，发给人民币，按时收方，按时发款，都是很好的经验。总之，领导水利工程人员不能把工资问题和收方、发粮，看作是单纯的事务工作，而要把它看作是领导民工的重要工作，是激励民工劳动热情，提高民工劳动效率的具有关键性的工作。必须对此加以重视，再配合政治宣传鼓动工作，才能把民工领导好。
    此外，做好准备工作是做好春修工程的另一个关键。去年春修所发生的错误浪费，由于准备工作不细密、不确实、不周到者，占很大部分。今年要切实注意计划性，以避免重复过去的错误。在这一方面，去年所犯的错误，大约有下述几种类型：一种是工程的规划过大，动员的人数过多，而干部配备，事务准备等等配合不上；一种是工程的计划不成熟，临时改变或增加工程，以致造成被动；一种是领导上对准备工作抓得不紧，对各种意外的困难估计不足，或者是缺乏调查研究，估计的情况与实际不符，以致临事仓皇，造成困难；个别工程中，甚至发生大量民工的疾病以至于死亡的不幸现象，更是不可原谅的错误。其中，经验不足，准备与组织不细密，则是比较普遍的缺点。针对这些缺点，水利部的指示中已经有详细的指示，各地区除去应根据具体情况，切实检查以外，目前尤其要抓紧两个方面：一方面是前面所说的动员组织工作，应从群众动员起，便打下良好的基础。另一面是技术与事务的准备工作，如粮食料物的运备、工程的测量定线、工段划分、工地布置和民工食宿的安排，以保证能够按时开工。
    总之，几百万民工参加水利春修工程，这是一件极大的事情。时间很紧迫了，希望有关地区的干部和人民，动员起来，勇敢地负起这个巨大的任务，努力奋发，为战胜洪水，避免灾荒，为保卫生产，争取更大的丰收而奋斗。
