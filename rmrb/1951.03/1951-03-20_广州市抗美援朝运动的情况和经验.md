　　The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Guangzhou:

    The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Guangzhou began after the Third Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress in November of last year. Following the meeting, the city launched a large-scale political study and propaganda campaign, with a total of approximately 300,000 cadres, organized masses, and residents of various districts participating. At that time, there was a surge in applications to join the volunteer army, factories launched production competitions, and the business community established patriotic covenants. However, there was no unified leadership or plan at the time, so the movement was not very deep, and its development was extremely uneven (only schools were better).

    On November 27th, the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression was established. From December 1st to 20th, a Resist America, Aid Korea movement week was launched, focusing on ideological education to establish an attitude of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism among the masses, in order to promote further progress in all aspects of work. The steps of the movement were: (1) extensively organizing various units and sectors to hold accusation meetings; (2) mobilizing propaganda; (3) holding anti-American demonstrations and parades in districts throughout the city.

    On the basis of the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and organizational work in November, an accusation movement was launched. After December 1st, the accusation movement unfolded comprehensively, gradually reaching a climax. A total of 300 accusation meetings of various sizes were held throughout the city, with 100,000 people participating (40,000 middle school teachers and students, 25,000 residents, more than 20,000 from the business community, women, religious circles, returned overseas Chinese, and primary school teachers, and nearly 10,000 workers). Afterwards, in conjunction with celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang and commemorating "December 9th" ahead of schedule, parades and demonstrations were held in districts throughout the city, with a total of more than 120,000 people participating. 30,000 members of the business community held a separate parade. 15,000 people participated in demonstrations and parades held by church schools and church groups. Prior to this, the Catholic Church had not expressed its stance on the Resist America, Aid Korea and Three-Self Patriotic Movement, but this time more than 1,000 believers participated in the parade. Starting on December 11th, students, teachers, and literary and art groups mobilized separately to conduct continuous three-day propaganda activities in the streets, factories, and rural suburbs, with schools alone mobilizing more than 30,000 people.

    During the movement, workers expanded production competitions; the business community actively carried out year-end tax payment work; and young people enthusiastically signed up to join military cadre schools (by the end of last year, the city totaled 13,000 people). During this stage, donations for comfort totalled 430 million yuan, 8,154 letters of comfort, and a batch of goods. A day of voluntary labor organized by female workers, housewives, and female teachers was attended by 7,485 people, engaged in processing work to support the front lines, completing 78,700 cotton quilts and 87,000 pairs of socks. In addition, the medical community organized blood transfusion groups and surgical medical teams. New and old literary and art workers were widely mobilized in the movement and actively engaged in creation. The printed propaganda materials alone reached more than 81 kinds, totaling more than 270,000 copies. Songs created by music workers, such as "Down with the American Devils," have become widely popular, with 100,000 people able to sing them. Stage performances by music teachers and Cantonese opera troupes attracted 58,000 viewers, street performances in five districts totaled 406 times, with 73,000 viewers, and Cantonese opera actors performed the skit "Jeans" 54 times, with approximately 60,000 viewers.

    Starting on New Year's Day this year, in coordination with celebrating the victory of the liberation of the eastern front of Korea and Seoul, the movement was pushed to a new climax. During this period, a large-scale review was held for the 10,000 young people who had signed up to join military cadre schools, and a large-scale movement to comfort the volunteer army was launched (while also preparing for the Spring Festival's support-the-army and preferential treatment-to-families movement). Cantonese opera actors were the first to respond to this movement, holding a charity performance for two days. By January 15th, the business community alone had donated more than 800 million yuan. Other sectors launched the thousand-yuan comfort movement and organized various charity performances and singing events, launching a mass voluntary donation movement, with cadres, teachers, and workers responding enthusiastically.

    Religious circles also gradually took action in the movement. Through parades, lower-level believers recognized the significance of the Resist America, Aid Korea and Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Many church schools and church hospitals issued statements declaring their separation from American imperialism. For example, at Lingnan University, after a city-wide accusation meeting, students shouted angrily, "When American imperialism falls, Lingnan rises." The vast majority of teachers and students were involved in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. After the Government Administration Council issued the decision to control American property within our country, all church groups in the city issued statements in support and established the Anti-American Patriotic Three-Self Promotion Committee.

    During the movement, the thinking of citizens underwent tremendous changes, initially eliminating the ideological poison that imperialism had instilled for a long time, and initially establishing a view of hating, despising, and disdaining the United States. The masses have mostly recognized the strength of the motherland and the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea, enhanced their national self-esteem and confidence in victory, and have felt the glory and pride of being a Chinese. Now, in the church schools, the views of "super-class, not asking about politics" have also been largely eliminated, and many professors have become more active in the movement.

    The working class, because of its deep patriotic ideology and anti-imperialist tradition, has shown great enthusiasm in political study and other concrete actions to resist America and aid Korea wherever the leadership has paid attention. At the same time, in all factories where production competitions have been launched, the competitions are gradually improving. However, the Resist America, Aid Korea work has not been widely and deeply carried out in most factories, and the depth of penetration is even more insufficient, and the production competition has not been well integrated with Resist America, Aid Korea ideological education.

    The above is a general overview of the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Guangzhou. The gains and experiences obtained in the movement are as follows:

    1. From the widespread mobilization of various strata, from the full enthusiasm of the masses in political study, accusations, parades, celebrations, and donations, and from the improvement of the masses' thinking, it can be said that the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is more universal and in-depth than any mass movement since liberation, and it is a continuous series of climaxes. Because the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement has truly become the city's primary task and mainstream of work, and has achieved the expected results, other arduous tasks, such as land reform in suburban areas, collecting winter clothes, preventing spies and special agents, household registration, and registration of reactionary party and league members, can also be carried out smoothly.

    2. Accusation meetings are the best method of self-education for the masses, and also an important method of improving middle elements, winning over backward elements, and pushing the movement to a climax. Accusation meetings generally start with accusing the atrocities of the US military, then accusing the economic aggression, cultural aggression, espionage activities, and persecution of overseas Chinese by American imperialism, and in conjunction with accusing the atrocities of the Japanese bandits, an patriotic movement against the rearmament of Japan by the United States is launched. Experience has proved that the form of accusation meetings is most easily accepted by the masses, and therefore it is also the most touching and effective.

    3. The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is a profound process of mass ideological education, a serious process of ideological struggle, and a process in which the masses' anti-imperialist and patriotic ideas are put into practice; therefore, ideological leadership must be clear, unified, and planned. In propaganda, attention must be paid to investigating and studying the dynamics of the thinking of the masses of various strata, analyzing and criticizing them separately, which is a necessary method to realize concrete ideological leadership and break through the ideological resistance of the masses. In this movement, the city answered more than 20 important ideological questions existing among the masses and printed them into small booklets as the main reference documents for speakers and propagandists, making propaganda more powerful and effective than before.

### 广州市抗美援朝运动的情况和经验

　　广州市抗美援朝运动的情况和经验
    广州市的抗美援朝运动，是从去年十一月第三届市人民代表会议以后开始的。会后，全市展开了大规模的时事学习和宣传工作，总计参加的干部和有组织的群众以及各区居民约三十万人。当时，报名参加志愿军成为热潮，工厂则展开了生产竞赛，工商界则订立了爱国公约等。但当时尚没有统一的领导和计划，因而运动很不深入，发展也极不平衡（仅学校较好）。
    十一月二十七日，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会广州市分会成立。十二月一日至二十日展开了抗美援朝运动周，以在群众中建立对美帝国主义的仇视、鄙视、蔑视观点的思想教育为中心，以推动各方面的工作前进一步。运动的步骤是：（一）广泛组织各单位各界举行控诉会；（二）出动宣传；（三）全市分区举行反美示威游行。
    在十一月抗美援朝宣传和组织工作的基础上，展开了控诉运动。十二月一日以后，控诉运动即全面展开，步步推向高潮。总计全市共开大小控诉会达三百次，参加群众十万（中学师生四万，居民二万五千，工商界、妇女、宗教界、归国华侨、小学教师等二万多，工人近万）。之后，即结合庆祝平壤光复，提前纪念“一二、九”，全市分区举行了游行示威，参加群众共达十二万余人。工商界三万人则单独举行了游行。教会学校、教会团体所举行的示威游行，有一万五千人参加。在这以前，天主教对抗美援朝和三自运动未作表示，此次则有千余教徒参加游行。十二月十一日起，学生、教师和文艺工作团体分别出动到街头、工厂、郊区农村进行了连续三天的宣传活动，仅学校即出动三万多人。
    运动中工人扩大了生产竞赛；工商界积极进行年终完税工作；青年则热烈报名参加军事干部学校（至去年年底止，全市共达一万三千人）。在这一阶段中，各界慰劳捐款共四亿三千万元，慰问信八千一百五十四件，物品一批。女工、家庭妇女及女教师组织的一天义务劳动，共有七千四百八十五人参加，从事支援前线的加工工作，计完成棉被七万八千七百床，袜八万七千双。此外，医务界组织了输血团和手术医疗队。新旧文艺工作者则在运动中广泛动员起来，积极从事创作。单是印发的宣传品即达八十一种，计二十七万份以上。音乐工作者创作的《打倒美国鬼》等歌曲已广泛流行，会唱者达十万人。音乐教师和粤剧班的舞台演出，吸引观众达五万八千人，五个区的街头演出共四百零六次，观众七万三千人，粤剧艺人演出《牛仔裤》活报剧五十四次，观众约六万。
    今年元旦起，配合庆祝朝鲜东线及汉城光复胜利，运动更推向新高潮。在此期间，曾对报名参加军事干部学校的万余青年举行了大检阅，并展开了大规模的慰劳志愿军的运动（同时准备春节拥军优属）。粤剧艺人首先响应这一运动，举行义演大会两天。至一月十五日止，仅工商户即捐八亿多元。其他各界则展开千元慰劳运动以及组织各种义演、义唱，展开群众性的志愿捐献运动，干部、教师、工人，均热烈响应。
    宗教界在运动中也逐渐行动起来，经过游行，使下层教徒认识了抗美援朝和三自革新运动的意义。不少教会学校和教会医院，纷纷声明与美帝国主义脱离关系。如岭南大学，经过全校控诉大会，学生们发出“美帝倒下去，岭南站起来”的怒吼。绝大多数师生卷入了抗美援朝运动。政务院发布管制美国在我国境内的财产决定后，全市教会团体均声明拥护，并成立了反美爱国三自促进委员会。
    运动中市民群众的思想起了巨大变化，初步扫除了帝国主义长期灌输的思想毒害，初步确立了仇美、鄙美、蔑美的观点。群众多已认识祖国力量的强大和抗美援朝的意义，提高了民族自尊心和胜利信心，已感到做一个中国人的光荣和自豪。现在在教会学校的学生中，“超阶级、不问政治”的观点，亦大部消除，许多教授在运动中变得积极起来。
    工人阶级因有深厚的爱国主义思想和反帝传统，凡是领导方面重视的地方，工人的时事学习及其他抗美援朝具体行动都表现得非常热烈。同时，凡发动生产竞赛的工厂，竞赛都在逐步提高中。但是，抗美援朝工作在大多数工厂还未广泛深入的展开，深入程度就更显得不够，生产竞赛也多未与抗美援朝思想教育很好地结合起来。
    以上是广州市抗美援朝运动开展以来的大概情况。在运动中所取得了的收获和体验有如下几点：
    一、从各阶层动员的广泛程度，从群众在时事学习、控诉、游行、祝捷、捐献中的饱满情绪以及群众思想的提高方面看来，可以说，抗美援朝运动的开展较解放以来任何时期的群众运动都更为普遍与深入，而且是一个高潮接着一个高潮，持续不断。由于抗美援朝运动真正成为全市首要任务和工作主流，而且又已取得预期的效果，因而其他繁重的任务，如郊区土地改革，捐募寒衣，防备奸细防备特务，户口登记，反动党团分子登记等也都能够顺利地进行。
    二、控诉会是群众自我教育的最好方法，也是在运动中提高中间分子，争取落后分子和将运动推向高潮的重要方法之一。控诉会一般是由控诉美军暴行，进而控诉美帝国主义的经济侵略，文化侵略，间谍活动，以及对华侨的迫害等，并结合对日寇暴行的控诉，展开了反对美国重新武装日本的爱国运动。经验证明，控诉会的形式，最易为群众所接受，因而也感人最深，收效也最大。
    三、抗美援朝运动是一个深刻的群众思想教育过程，也是一个严重的思想斗争过程，又是群众反帝爱国思想见诸实践的过程；因此思想领导必须明确、统一和有计划。在宣传上，必须注意调查研究各阶层群众思想的动态，分别加以分析批判，这是实现具体思想领导、打破群众思想阻力的必要方法。在这次运动中，全市曾解答了二十多个群众中存在的重要思想问题，并印成小册子，作为演讲员、宣传人员的主要参考文件，使宣传较前有力，收效也较前为大。
