Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS news: Public opinion in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria warmly supports the declarations and resolutions adopted by the First Session of the World Peace Council.
	The Polish United Workers' Party's official newspaper, *People's Tribune*, published an editorial entitled *The Voice of the World's Conscience*, stating: The World Peace Council, representing all people from eighty countries who safeguard peace and international security, has issued a call from Berlin. The Polish people unanimously support the World Peace Council's proposal for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. They believe that if all the people of the world follow Stalin's instructions, take on the cause of defending peace, and defend it to the end, the heroic struggle to defend peace will surely be victorious. The editorial of *Labor Voice* pointed out: Geographical boundaries, differences in religious or political beliefs, and national differences cannot prevent all good people from uniting to fight for the maintenance of peace. The Stockholm Peace Appeal clearly stated that governments that first use atomic weapons should be declared war criminals, and the World Peace Council's declaration also clearly stipulates the issue of responsibility for launching a new world war. The Polish people, who suffered greatly in the last war, will greet the World Peace Council's declaration with redoubled efforts, just as they welcomed the Stockholm Appeal.
	Czechoslovak newspapers prominently published the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact and other resolutions. The headlines of the newspapers unanimously emphasized that the historic resolutions adopted by the World Peace Council will further unite and mobilize more people around the world to fight against the threat of a new world war.
	Romanian newspapers published the resolutions adopted by the World Peace Council prominently on February 28th and published commentaries. *Free Romania* stated: The Romanian people, who are building socialism, wholeheartedly support these historic resolutions of the World Peace Council and have mobilized to fight for the realization of these resolutions. *Trade Union Life* pointed out: The unity of the people of all countries has never been as strong as it is today in the face of the war danger created by the imperialists. Representatives of people of all countries with extremely different political and religious beliefs have never cooperated as successfully as they did at the meeting of the World Peace Council. *Spark* published many letters from people's representatives, who expressed their complete agreement with the resolutions of the World Peace Council.
	Bulgarian newspapers and the people unanimously hailed the resolutions of the World Peace Council. *Fatherland Front* published an editorial entitled *The Cause of Peace is in the Hands of the People*, stating: The World Peace Council has not disappointed the expectations of hundreds of millions of people around the world. The declaration and resolutions of the meeting expressed the demands of the overwhelming majority of mankind who are concerned about peace and are ready to fight for peace in simple and moving words, concisely and clearly. These resolutions mobilize millions of peace advocates to fight further. Kalaslavov, Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the Bulgarian National Peace Committee, Dimitrov Prize winner, and writer, pointed out: This declaration is fully in line with the demands of all progressive human beings and all hard-working people in Bulgaria. Pavlov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, declared: Bulgarian scientific workers and all intellectuals fully support the declaration of the World Peace Council. They will sign this declaration to stop the Third World War. There is no doubt that if we consistently defend the cause of peace to the end and consolidate our sacred friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in every possible way, war is not inevitable. Bishop Aiola, Secretary-General of the Bulgarian Orthodox Holy Synod, said: I firmly believe that the people of all countries will keep the declaration of the World Peace Council in mind and unanimously support it with concrete actions.

　　各人民民主国家舆论
    拥护和平理事会决议
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社消息：波、捷、罗、保四国舆论热烈拥护世界和平理事会第一届会议所通过的宣言及决议。
    波兰统一工人党机关报《人民论坛》报以《世界良心的呼声》为题发表社论称：世界和平理事会代表着八十个国家的所有维护和平与国际安全的人们从柏林发出了呼声。波兰人民一致拥护世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的建议。他们认为：如果全世界人民都遵照斯大林的指示，将维护和平的事业担当起来并将它保卫到底，保卫和平的英雄斗争一定会取得胜利。《劳动之声》报的社论指出：地域的界限、宗教或政治信仰的分歧以及民族的差别都不能阻碍一切善良的人民团结起来为维护和平而斗争。斯德哥尔摩和平宣言曾明确地提出了要宣布首先使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯，世界和平理事会的宣言也明确地规定了发动新世界战争的责任问题。曾在上次大战中备受痛苦的波兰人民，将像迎接斯德哥尔摩宣言一样以加倍的努力来迎接世界和平理事会的宣言。
    捷克斯洛伐克各报以显著地位刊载了世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言及其他各项决议。各报在标题中一致强调指出：世界和平理事会所通过的历史性决议，将进一步团结与动员全世界更多的人民为反对新世界战争的威胁而斗争。
    罗马尼亚的各报于二月二十八日以显著地位刊登了世界和平理事会所通过的各项决议并发表了评论。《自由罗马尼亚报》称：正在建设社会主义的罗马尼亚人民衷心拥护世界和平理事会这些历史性的决议，并已动员起来为实现这些决议而斗争。《工会生活报》指出：各国人民的团结从来没有像今天在帝国主义者所制造的战争危险面前表现得这样强有力。一切国家具有极不相同的政治与宗教信仰的人们的代表，从来没有像在世界和平理事会会议上合作得这样成功。《火花报》发表了许多人民代表的来信，他们表示完全赞同世界和平理事会的决议。
    保加利亚的报纸和人民一致欢呼世界和平理事会的决议。《祖国阵线》报发表题为《和平事业掌握在人民手上》的社论称：世界和平理事会没有辜负全世界亿万人民的期望。会议的宣言与决议以简单而动人心魄的词句，扼要而明确地表达了占人类压倒多数的关心和平而且准备为和平而斗争的人民的要求。这些决议动员了千百万和平拥护者去作进一步的斗争。保加利亚全国和平委员会执行局主席、季米特洛夫奖金获得者、作家卡拉斯拉渥夫指出：这一宣言完全符合目前一切进步人类及保加利亚全体勤劳人民的要求。保加利亚科学院主席巴夫洛夫宣称：保加利亚科学工作者及一切知识分子完全支持世界和平理事会的宣言。他们将在这项宣言上签名，以制止第三次世界大战。毫无疑问地，如果我们一致维护和平事业到底，并以一切方法来巩固我们与伟大的苏联及各人民民主国家的神圣友谊，战争就不是不可避免的。保加利亚正教圣议会秘书长艾俄拉主教说：我坚定地相信各国人民都将把世界和平理事会的宣言牢记在心，并一致用具体的行动来支持它。
