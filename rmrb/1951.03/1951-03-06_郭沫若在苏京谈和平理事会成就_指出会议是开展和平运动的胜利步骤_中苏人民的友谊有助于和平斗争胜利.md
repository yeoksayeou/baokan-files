Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th. According to TASS Moscow: Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and head of the Chinese delegation to the First Session of the World Peace Council, upon arriving in Moscow on his way back to China from Berlin, gave an interview to a reporter from Izvestia on the 4th, discussing the achievements of the First Session of the World Peace Council. He stated that this meeting was another victorious step towards further developing the movement to defend peace. In the short period since the closing of the Second World Peace Congress, developments have shown that the vast majority of people around the world desire peace, and only a small handful of warmongers – the big monopoly capitalists – are trying to launch another world war in order to profit from the war. This is the reason why the struggle to defend peace has recently developed so magnificently. The current Council meeting shows that the resolutions of the Second Peace Congress are being implemented, and the number of council members has increased by thirty-eight. Representatives from countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand participated in the work for the first time, all of which are proof that the strength and scale of the peace movement are growing day by day.

Guo Moruo continued: Those who participated in the First Session of the World Peace Council were deeply encouraged by Stalin's recent interview with a reporter from Pravda. Because this interview simply and clearly explained the current international situation and defined new tasks for further developing the struggle to defend peace, it greatly helped the work of the Berlin meeting. This is the reason why all the epoch-making documents passed at the meeting reflected Stalin's wise words.

Guo Moruo then pointed out: The various resolutions passed at the Berlin meeting are of great importance for expanding and consolidating the peace front. Concluding a peace pact is a perfect and concrete way to determine who supports peace and who needs war. The scale of the movement to collect signatures on this declaration will certainly exceed the movement to collect signatures on the Stockholm Appeal. Guo Moruo emphasized: Our purpose is to make everyone understand the great significance of concluding a peace pact. Concluding a peace pact by the five major powers is not their privilege, but their responsibility and obligation. Because peace-loving people of all countries have the right to question whether the five major powers advocate peace or advocate war, because the solution to this problem mainly depends on these five countries. The Chinese people must work together with the Soviet people to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact with all our strength, and strive to get the broadest masses of the Chinese people to sign the declaration.

Guo Moruo emphasized: The World Peace Council's resolutions on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, on resolving the issues of Japan and Germany peacefully, on the struggle for peace in colonial and dependent countries, and on the resolution condemning the unjust decision of the United Nations to condemn the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in Korea, are fully in line with the interests and desires of the Chinese people. These resolutions are completely consistent with the recommendations made by the Chinese delegation at the meeting. All of these documents will give the Chinese people great encouragement to carry out the struggle to defend peace and security in the Far East and the world. The Berlin meeting once again proved that the people of all countries enthusiastically support their Asian brothers in the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence. The World Peace Council's resolution on the unjust decision of the United Nations to condemn the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" most powerfully proves that this shameful decision has aroused the universal indignation of people all over the world. The people of the Far East have always believed that the struggle to defend peace will surely be victorious, and this belief has now been further strengthened.

Guo Moruo finally emphasized: The success of the Berlin meeting was largely due to the unanimous action of representatives from all countries around the world. But I would like to especially thank the great Stalin for his help and support. For the safety of mankind and for the happiness of our future generations, we must crush the criminal plans of the warmongers. The strong brotherly friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people greatly contributes to achieving this victory. Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　郭沫若在苏京谈和平理事会成就
    指出会议是开展和平运动的胜利步骤
    中苏人民的友谊有助于和平斗争胜利
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：世界和平理事会执行局副主席、中国出席世界和平理事会第一届会议代表团团长郭沫若，在由柏林返国途中道经莫斯科，于四日向消息报记者发表谈话，论述世界和平理事会第一届会议的成就称：这次会议是走向进一步开展保卫和平运动的又一胜利步骤。在第二届世界和平大会闭幕以后的短短时期内，事态的发展表明了全世界绝大多数人民都希望和平，只有一小撮战争贩子——大垄断资本家才力图发动另一次大战，以便从战争中获取利润。保卫和平的斗争最近之所以发展得这样波澜壮阔，原因就在这里。本届理事会议表明第二届和平大会的决议正在付诸实施，理事会的理事又增加了三十八人，日本、菲律宾、泰国等国的代表第一次参加了会议的工作，这都是和平运动的力量与规模与日俱增的明证。
    郭沫若继称：参加世界和平理事会第一届会议的人，都深深受到斯大林最近对真理报记者所发表的谈话的鼓舞。因为这个谈话简单而明了地说明了目前的国际局势，并确定了进一步开展保卫和平斗争的新任务，从而大大帮助了柏林会议的工作。会议所通过的一切划时代的文件之所以都反映了斯大林的英明的谈话，其原因就在这里。
    郭沫若继而指出：柏林会议所通过的各项决议，对于扩大与巩固和平阵线具有巨大的重要性。缔结和平公约就是确定谁拥护和平、谁需要战争的完善而具体的方法。征集在这一宣言上签名的运动的规模，必定会超过斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动。郭沫若强调称：我们的目的便是要使每一个人都明了缔结和平公约的重大意义。五大国缔结和平公约并不是它们的特权，而是它们的责任和义务。因为爱好和平的各国人民都有权质问五大国是主张和平还是主张战争，因为这一问题的解决主要是取决于这五个国家。中国人民一定要和苏联人民在一道以全力争取缔结和平公约，并且努力使最广大的中国人民在宣言上签名。
    郭沫若强调称：世界和平理事会关于和平解决朝鲜问题、关于以和平方式解决日本和德国问题的决议，关于殖民地与附属国争取和平斗争的决议，以及关于联合国通过谴责中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的不公正的决定之决议，是完全符合中国人民的利益和愿望的。这些决议和中国代表团在会上所提出的建议完全一致。这一切文件都会给中国人民以极大的鼓舞，去进行保卫远东与世界和平与安全的斗争。柏林会议再一次证明所有国家的人民都热烈支持他们的亚洲兄弟们争取和平、自由和民族独立的斗争。世界和平理事会通过关于联合国谴责中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的不公正的决定之决议，最有力地证明了这个可耻的决定已引起了全世界人民的普遍愤慨。远东人民一向相信保卫和平的斗争必定胜利，现在这种信念已更为加强了。
    郭沫若最后强调称：柏林会议的成功大部分由于全世界各国代表的一致行动。但是我愿意特别感谢伟大的斯大林给予我们的帮助和支持。为了人类的安全，为了我们后代子孙的幸福，我们要粉碎战争贩子的犯罪计划。苏联人民和中国人民之间的坚强的兄弟友谊大大有助于取得这一胜利。中苏友好万岁！
