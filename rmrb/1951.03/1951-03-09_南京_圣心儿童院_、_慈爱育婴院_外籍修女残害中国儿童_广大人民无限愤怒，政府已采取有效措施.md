Imperialist "charity" has created extreme evils in China. Nanjing City has successively exposed the criminal facts of the "Nanjing Sacred Heart Orphanage" and the "Nanjing Loving Mother Infant Home" in abusing Chinese children.

　　The "Nanjing Sacred Heart Orphanage" was founded in 1937, sponsored by the Catholic Church, with Irish nun Lan Yide as the director. In November 1947, the orphanage added a foster home, headed by French nun Hua Ande. Children sent to the orphanage for fostering had to pay five dou of white rice, two jin of white sugar, and a bar of soap per month; and other expenses could be added at any time. However, the orphanage did not take care of the fostered children at all, resulting in a very high mortality rate. According to the investigation, from January 1948 to June 1950, a total of 557 children were admitted to the orphanage, with 372 deaths. A health check of 103 infants in the orphanage in March 1950 revealed that as many as 89 were sick. This shocking mortality and disease rate was due to the orphanage's attempt to profit under the guise of "charity," disregarding the health and safety of the children. As early as May 17, 1950, Nanjing citizen Liu Jiahe exposed in the Nanjing Xinhua Daily the orphanage's negligence of life, causing the infant Liu Beibei to be scalded to death, which aroused infinite indignation among the people of Nanjing. Many parents who fostered their children in the orphanage successively filed lawsuits, and the Nanjing Municipal People's Court upheld justice and accepted the trial. However, Lan Yide and Hua Ande argued that Liu Beibei's death from scalding was due to "pneumonia," and widely distributed leaflets, distorting the facts and covering up their guilt. After an autopsy revealed that the infant's death was not due to pneumonia, Lan Yide and Hua Ande admitted that it was caused by scalding. During the trial, citizen Ma Shuyuan accused the orphanage of abusing infants and starving Li Maomao to death. After investigation and examination, it was confirmed that Li Maomao died of long-term malnutrition, falling into a state of extreme hunger. The Nanjing Municipal People's Court accepted the people's accusations and, after a detailed investigation into the orphanage's disregard for children's lives, sentenced the orphanage director Lan Yide and the foster home director Hua Ande to six months in prison each, suspended for one year, and permanently expelled from the People's Republic of China; and compensated the plaintiffs for a loss of 2 million yuan in Renminbi.

　　The "Nanjing Loving Mother Infant Home" was founded in 1945 by the Kuomintang bandit gang Jiang Jingguo, Mao Qingxiang, etc., with Mr. and Mrs. Rukes, the leaders of the U.S. advisory group to the puppet Nationalist government, as advisors, and Mao Qingxiang's wife, Qiu Shanying, as the director. Before the liberation of Nanjing (winter of 1948), as the reactionaries were busy evacuating, the director of the orphanage was changed to Catholic nun Xue Guangxiu. Later, the Catholic Shengshenghui and Shengyanhui successively introduced 16 foreign Catholic nuns from the United States, Germany, and Austria to work in the orphanage, with German nun Fu Huifang as the deputy director. Under the leadership of the foreign nuns, the abuse and killing of infants was extremely serious. According to Xue Guangxiu's own admission, from January 1949 to June 1950, a total of 242 infants were admitted, with 153 deaths, a mortality rate of 63%. However, according to the orphanage's infant admission, discharge, and death registration books, the mortality rate was even more alarming. From July 1 to December 31, 1949, 69 infants were admitted, with 54 deaths, a mortality rate of 78.26%. The foreign nuns in the orphanage, wearing the cloak of "charity," after killing Chinese children, even said to the Chinese believers and the orphanage staff: "We should be happy for their death, because they have now ascended to the happy 'heaven'!" These foreign nuns ate milk, fruit, ham, and sausage themselves, while feeding the children pea flour and rice soup. Even eating a little lard was cancelled for the reason that "it will cause diarrhea." When the children were sick, they did not care. Almost every child in the orphanage had red, swollen, and ulcerated buttocks. According to an inspection in August 1950, 97% of the 56 infants at that time suffered from malnutrition, and one-third of them were extremely malnourished, making it difficult to save their lives; the 56 infants suffered from 18 kinds of diseases; 98% suffered from skin diseases; the most seriously ill infant suffered from nine diseases. All the infants were dying, looking like skeletons. The infant Ai Dai was over one year old, but weighed only 5 jin and 14 liang (municipal jin). The nuns in the orphanage also treated the children as commodities, charging each applicant for adoption one shi of white rice per infant. From Fu Huifang's accounts, it was found that the income from selling infants in five months reached 4.285 million yuan. The orphanage has been thoroughly investigated by the Nanjing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau and is currently being strictly dealt with.

　　南京“圣心儿童院”、“慈爱育婴院”
    外籍修女残害中国儿童
    广大人民无限愤怒，政府已采取有效措施
    帝国主义的“慈善事业”，在中国制造了极大的罪恶。南京市曾先后揭发了“南京圣心儿童院”、“南京慈爱育婴院”残害中国儿童的罪恶事实。
    “南京圣心儿童院”成立于一九三七年，由天主教主办，爱尔兰籍修女兰义德任院长。一九四七年十一月该院添设寄养院，负责人为法籍修女华安德。送该院寄养的儿童，每名每月须缴白米五斗，白糖二斤，肥皂一条；并得被随时增收其他费用。但该院对寄养儿童，毫不照顾，造成极大的死亡率。据调查，一九四八年一月至一九五○年六月，入院儿童共五百五十七名，死亡三百七十二名。一九五○年三月对该院一百零三名婴儿进行健康检查的结果，患病者竟达八十九名之多。这种惊人的死亡、疾病率，乃是由于该院假借“慈善”幌子图谋营利，漠视儿童健康及生命安全所致。早在一九五○年五月十七日，南京市市民柳嘉禾曾在南京新华日报揭露该院玩忽人命、烫伤婴儿柳贝贝因不治致死一事，激起南京市各界人民的无限愤慨。很多寄养该院儿童的家长，相继提出控诉，南京市人民法院主持正义，接受审理。但兰义德和华安德对柳贝贝烫伤致死一事，狡辩为“肺炎”致死，并广散传单，歪曲事实，掩饰罪责。后经剖验检查婴尸，确定并非肺炎，兰义德、华安德始承认烫伤致死。在审理期中，复有市民马淑媛控告该院虐待婴儿，饿死李毛毛事件。后经调查及检验结果，李毛毛确系长期营养不良，陷于极度饥饿状态致死。南京市人民法院接受人民的控告，对该院草菅儿童生命，进行详细调查后，已判决该院院长兰义德及寄养所负责人华安德二人各处徒刑六个月，缓刑一年，永远驱逐出中华人民共和国国境；并赔偿原告损失人民币二百万元。
    “南京慈爱育婴院”成立于一九四五年，原系国民党匪帮蒋经国、毛庆祥等创办，以美国驻伪国民政府顾问团团长鲁克斯夫妇等为顾问，毛庆祥之妻邱珊英为院长。南京解放前（一九四八年冬），该院在反动派忙乱撤离中，院长改为天主教修女薛广秀担任。以后并由天主教圣神会及圣言会先后介绍美、德、奥外籍天主教修女十六人入院工作，以德籍修女傅慧芳任副院长。该院在外籍修女主持之下，虐杀婴儿情形极为严重。据薛广秀自己承认：自一九四九年一月至一九五○年六月，共收进婴儿二百四十二名，死亡一百五十三名，死亡率达百分之六十三。但根据该院婴儿入院、出院、死亡登记簿统计，死亡率更为惊人。一九四九年七月一日至十二月三十一日，入院婴儿六十九名，死亡五十四名，死亡率竟为百分之七十八·二六。该院外籍修女，披着“慈善”的外衣，残杀中国儿童之后还对中国教徒及该院员工们说：“我们应该为他们的死亡而快乐，因为他们现在已升到快乐的‘天堂’去了！”这批外国修女自己吃牛奶、水果、火腿、香肠，而给孩子们吃豌豆粉，喝米汤，连吃一点猪油也以“吃了会拉肚子”的理由被取消了。孩子生病，他们不管，几乎全院没有一个孩子不是臀部红肿溃烂的。据一九五○年八月检查，在当时五十六个婴儿中有百分之九十七患营养不良症，其中极度营养不良，致难挽救生命者，占三分之一；五十六个婴儿中患有十八种疾病；患皮肤病者占百分之九十八；最严重的一个婴儿一身患有九种疾病。所有婴儿都奄奄一息，形同骷髅。婴儿爱玳，一岁多了，才只有五斤十四两（市斤）。该院修女并把孩子当作商品，向申请领养者，每名婴儿索价白米一石。从傅慧芳的账目中，查出五个月中共收进卖婴费达四百二十八万五千元之多。该院已经南京市民政局详细调查，现正进行严格处理中。
