　　Against US Rearmament of West Germany
　　Increasing Number of Signatures in France

　　【Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow】TASS, Paris, 28th - *L'Humanité* reports: The number of signatures in France against the rearmament of West Germany is constantly increasing. In 184 residential areas of Seine-et-Oise, 181,554 signatures have been collected. In the Gard department, 115,928 residents have signed; in the Hautes-Pyrénées department, 30,000 people have signed.

　　*L'Humanité* states: One hundred and twenty prominent figures in Amiens, Somme, issued a declaration protesting against the arming of West Germany and Japan and the release of Hitler's war criminals. The declaration calls for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War, the cessation of the war in Indochina, and universal disarmament.

　　In several provinces of France, administrative authorities continue to obstruct the protest movement against the arming of West Germany. *L'Humanité* reports: A local authority in Haute-Vienne has ordered the mayor of Séreilhac, Martin, to be suspended from his post for one month because declarations calling for strengthening the struggle against the arming of West Germany were posted on the walls of the town hall building.
