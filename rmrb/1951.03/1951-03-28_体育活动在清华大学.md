　　Sports Activities at Tsinghua University

　　Since the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement began, Tsinghua University has listed sports activities as an important part of the Student Union's work. Students also universally demand to improve their physical fitness in preparation for dedicating themselves to the construction of New China in the future.

　　Every day from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, students pour from the laboratories, classrooms, libraries, and dormitories to the large playground and gymnasium to participate in group exercises, collective dances, basketball, soccer, volleyball, track and field, parallel bars, horizontal bars... Over five hundred people participate in cross-country running alone. Female students are not lagging behind their male counterparts. In the beginning, they only did some gentle exercises, but later they also started playing on vaulting horses and parallel bars. They also play basketball with the male students.

　　The entire Tsinghua campus is immersed in a wave of sports activities.

　　Many sports groups have emerged throughout the school, and everyone is organizing to encourage and help each other. The Youth League members and students of the Geology Department's first grade are united and persistent in exercising. At the same time, they organize physically weak students and let them participate in gentle exercises. This gradually cultivates everyone's habit and interest in sports, and often 80% of the class can be found on the playground. Students in the fourth grade of the Electrical Engineering Department criticized a few students who neglected sports activities through blackboards.

　　The Sports Department and the Student Union have formulated "Labor and National Defense Elementary Standards" to help students exercise with goals and plans. They also called on students to strive to meet these standards and become healthy young people who can undertake productive labor and national defense construction.

　　体育活动在清华大学
    清华大学通讯组
    自抗美援朝运动开始以后，清华大学把体育活动列为学生会工作的重要部分。同学们也普遍要求将自己的身体锻炼好，准备在将来献身于新中国的建设工作。
    每天下午五时到六时，同学们从实验室里、课堂里、图书馆里、宿舍里涌向大操场和体育馆，参加团体操、集体舞、篮球、足球、排球、田径赛、单双杠……。单只越野赛跑一项，就有五百多人参加。女同学们也不落后于男同学。她们在开始时只做一些和缓的运动，到后来也玩起木马、单双杠来了。还和男同学们一起打篮球。
    整个清华园都沉浸在体育活动的热潮里了。
    全校又出现了许多的体育小组，大家组织起来互相鼓励互相帮助。地质系一年级青年团员和同学团结在一起，坚持运动。同时还把体弱的同学组织起来，让他们参加动作和缓的运动。这样就使大家渐渐地培养起爱好体育的习惯和兴趣，全班经常有百分之八十的同学都能到操场上去。电机系四年级同学通过黑板报批评了少数忽视体育活动的同学。
    体育部和学生会则订出了“劳动国防初级标准”，帮助同学们有目标、有计划地锻炼身体。并号召同学们争取达到这个标准，做一个能担负起生产劳动和国防建设的健康青年。
