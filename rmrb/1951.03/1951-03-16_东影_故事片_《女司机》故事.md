    The Dalian Locomotive Depot of the Sino-Soviet Railway is starting to train female train drivers. Soviet technician Seyedov is personally in charge of the education plan. Party member Sun Guilan is the last to sign up, completing the group of ten female comrades. A new life and arduous learning begin. The first stage is coal shoveling practice. Sun Guilan works hard, but because Master Lu, who leads her group, lacks confidence in women learning to drive trains, he is unwilling to help patiently. Therefore, the progress of Sun Guilan, Song Guixiang, and Wang Lanying is very slow. Late at night, Sun Guilan practices hard at the coal shoveling yard alone. With the help of activist Xiao Zhang, mobilized by the Party branch, she finally meets the standard. She immediately goes to tell her partners the tricks she has learned.
    Theoretical study begins. Sun Guilan still studies diligently, but because her educational level is too low, she faces more difficulties. As a result of the exam, Feng Xiaomei achieves the best results and is quite complacent. Sun Guilan fails the exam and is deeply self-reproachful, but she is not discouraged. She is determined to overcome all difficulties and persist in learning. The Party leadership sees her strong will and encourages her to continue her efforts.
    The train speeds across the wilderness, and the progress of female driver training is also advancing rapidly, receiving encouragement and condolences from all over the country. At the eight-month summary, Sun Guilan is praised, while Feng Xiaomei's arrogance and complacency gradually develop. She proposes to challenge Sun Guilan in the inspection locomotive exam competition. For the sake of everyone's progress, Sun Guilan agrees to a group collective competition. As a result, because Sun Guilan can unite and help others, her group wins, while Feng Xiaomei only cares about her personal achievements, and the entire group falls behind.
    In the final individual locomotive operation exam, thanks to Sun Guilan's calmness and courage, she saves a dangerous accident almost caused by Feng Xiaomei, and finally arrives at the terminal station on time, ending the entire training process. After the Party's education and help, and touched by Sun Guilan's sincere and steadfast qualities, Feng Xiaomei recognizes the shortcomings of individualism. Master Lu also corrects his view of underestimating women.
    A warm departure ceremony is held on the platform. A sea of people cheer, and the song "People's Train Attendant" resounds through the sky. Three trains, carrying the first batch of female train drivers in New China, head towards the wilderness of the motherland! The tenth feature film will be released on March 17th.

    中长铁路大连机务段训练火车女司机的工作正在开始，苏联技师谢道夫亲自主持教育计划。党员孙桂兰最后一个报到，恰巧凑足十个女同志新的生活和艰苦的学习开始了，第一阶段是投炭实习，孙桂兰刻苦用功，但由于领导她小组的陆师傅对于妇女学习开火车没有信心，不肯耐心帮助。所以孙桂兰、宋桂香、王兰英三人的进度很慢。深夜里，孙桂兰独自在投炭场苦练，经党支部动员积极分子小张加以帮助，终于达到了标准数，她立刻把学得的窍门去告诉她的伙伴们去了。

  火车在原野里飞快的奔驰，女司机训练的进度也在突飞猛进，获得了全国各地的鼓励和慰问。在八个月的总结时，孙桂兰受到了表扬，而冯小梅的骄傲自满也逐渐发展，提出在检查机车的考试竞赛里，向孙桂兰挑战。孙桂兰为了大家的进步，同意分组集体竞赛，结果因为孙桂兰能团结和帮助别人，她领导的小组获得优胜，冯小梅只顾个人的成绩全组落了后。
  在最后一次单独掌握机车的考试里，由于孙桂兰的沉着和勇敢，挽救了冯小梅险些造成的危险事故，终于准点到达终点车站，结束了全部的训练过程。冯小梅经过党的教育帮助，和孙桂兰诚朴坚靷的品质所感动，认识了个人主义的缺点，陆师傅也纠正了轻视妇女的观点。
  月台上举行着热烈的出车典礼，人山人海的群众在欢呼，“人民乘务员”的歌声响彻云霄，三辆火车带着新中国的第一批火车女司机，奔向祖国的原野！第十部·故事片三月十七日上映
