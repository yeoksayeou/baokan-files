Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai, February 18th to 22nd - Shanghai held a city-wide representative meeting of industrial and commercial circles. At the meeting, the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce was formally established. In light of the current situation, combined with the patriotic movement and the country's general tasks for this year, the future direction and steps of efforts were determined. The participating representatives accused the Japanese invaders of atrocities and resolutely opposed the United States arming Japan.

The meeting elected Sheng Peihua as the chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Wu Xuezhi, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Yiren, and Xiang Shuxiang as vice-chairmen. The meeting also elected 115 executive committee members, 35 supervisory committee members, 27 alternate executive committee members, and 9 alternate supervisory committee members. The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce was formally established.

Shanghai's industry and commerce suffered deeply from the devastation of the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, all representatives expressed unparalleled anger at the US unilateral reconciliation with Japan and the conspiracy to rearm Japan. Many people recounted their personal experiences to the assembly. Xie Renbing, manager of the Commercial Press, a representative of the publishing industry, said: "The destruction of the Chinese publishing industry by the Japanese invaders was devastating. The large-scale Commercial Press printing and manufacturing plant was completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft on the 'January 28th' incident. Opposite the printing plant, the Oriental Library, with the most complete equipment in the country and a collection of more than 460,000 Chinese and foreign books, was also burned down."

Chen Fenghao, manager of Zhonghua Pharmaceutical Factory, on behalf of the ten light industrial units of the 17th group of the meeting, accused all representatives: "In order to dump Japanese porcelain, the Japanese invaders bombed and destroyed more than 100 porcelain kilns in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province. China's glass industry, enamel industry, and aluminum industry also suffered serious losses during the Japanese invasion. The glass factory opened in Zhabei District was completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders' artillery fire. After the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese invaders dismantled the machinery and equipment of Shanghai's only remaining Jinghua Glass Factory. The large-scale Yitai Steel Essence Factory was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and even the remaining parts were looted by the Japanese invaders. More than 95% of Shanghai's industry had been devastated by the Japanese invaders."

Wu Renji, a representative of the metal printing and canning industry, and Wang Gengsan, a representative of the shipping industry, also resentfully accused all the representatives of the crimes committed by the Japanese invaders. Wang Gengsan was given the crime of not following traffic rules by the Japanese Marine Corps on May 8, 1945, and his left hip bone was broken by a rifle butt, leaving him disabled. Wang Gengsan accused the Japanese invaders of his oppression and poisoning, as well as the fact that the Japanese invaders plundered, bombed, and sank a total of more than 293,000 tons of shipping losses in China.

All the representatives at the meeting unanimously resolved: "We swear to take concrete and effective actions to smash the US conspiracy to unilaterally reconcile with and rearm Japan." At the end of the meeting, the letter to Chairman Mao, the telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and the telegram to the national industrial and commercial circles were adopted.

　　上海工商界举行代表会议
    许多代表愤怒控诉日寇罪行
    成立工商联，加强抗美援朝的斗争。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市于二月十八至二十二日举行全市工商界代表会议，会上，正式成立了上海市工商业联合会，并针对目前形势，结合爱国运动和本年度国家总任务，确定今后努力的方向和步骤。与会代表纷纷控诉日寇暴行，坚决反对美国武装日本。
    会议推选盛丕华为工商业联合会主任委员，吴雪之、刘鸿生、荣毅仁、项叔翔为副主任委员。会议并选举执行委员一百一十五人，监察委员三十五人，候补执行委员二十七人，候补监察委员九人。上海市工商业联合会至此正式成立。
    上海市工商业抗战期间遭受日寇深重的摧残，因此，全体代表对美国对日片面媾和、重新武装日本的阴谋，表示无比的愤怒。许多人向大会控诉他们的切身经过。出版业代表商务印书馆经理谢仁冰说：日寇对中国出版业的摧残是惨重的。规模宏大的商务印书馆印刷制造总厂，就是在“一二八”那天全部被日寇飞机炸毁的。在印刷厂对面，全国设备最完善，藏有中外图书四十六万多册的东方图书馆也同遭焚毁。
    中华制药厂经理陈丰镐代表会议第十七组的十个轻工业单位向全体代表控诉道：日寇为了倾销日本的瓷器，曾炸毁了江西省景德镇一百多座瓷窑。中国的玻璃工业、搪瓷工业、铝器工业，也都在日寇侵略期间遭到了严重损失。开设在闸北地区的玻璃工厂，被日寇的炮火摧毁无遗。上海沦陷后，日寇拆走了上海仅存的晶华玻璃厂的机器设备。规模很大的益泰钢精厂遭受日机轰炸后，连残余机件都被日寇抢走。上海有百分之九十五以上的工业，都曾遭受日寇摧残。
    金属印刷制罐工业代表吴人骥和轮船商业代表王更三也都怨愤地向全体代表控诉日寇的罪行。王更三在一九四五年五月八日被日本海军陆战队冠以不守交通规则的罪名，用步枪托打碎了左腿胯骨，成了残废。王更三控诉了日寇对他的压迫和毒害以及日寇掳掠、炸毁、炸沉我国航业界的船舶损失总计达二十九万三千多吨等事实。
    会上全体代表一致决议：誓以具体有效的行动，粉碎美国片面对日本媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋。会议最后通过了上毛主席书、向中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军致敬电和致全国工商界电。
