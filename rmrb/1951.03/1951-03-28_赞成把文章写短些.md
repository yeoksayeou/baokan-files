　　In Favor of Writing Shorter Articles
　　To the Editor:
    I have seen the People's Daily suggest writing shorter articles twice recently, and I wholeheartedly agree. The reason is that I really enjoy reading the newspaper, but whenever I see lengthy and long-winded pieces, I often put them aside due to time constraints or my own lack of patience. I often examine myself: I believe it's because my position is not firm, my old consciousness is deep-rooted, and I start from my own interests, but ultimately, I can't keep it up. This time, seeing the People's Daily openly raise this issue—shorter, even shorter—I seem to understand that this is not just my personal problem, but indeed a waste of words and a waste of time.
    Of course, we cannot emphasize deliberately shortening all articles, but we should never intentionally or unintentionally make articles so long. In the past, a certain newspaper advocated: try to make the news on the front page very concise, so that people who are busy with work, or people with less education, can get a concrete understanding in a short time. If you want to get some detailed information or specialized issues, it should be arranged on the second, third, or fourth page. This not only avoids omitting important issues, but also saves time, which is a win-win situation. So my opinion is:
    1. The editorial department has the right to shorten any article to make it concise to meet the requirements of readers;
    2. Articles that are unwilling or unable to be shortened should be published with increased space;
    3. Publicly request contributors to save words as much as possible, because it saves a little effort for one person, and reduces the trouble of tens of thousands of readers, which is what should be done;
    4. Specialized or longer articles should be published in regular publications, and make those publications as common as possible.

    Editor's Note: In order to strengthen the propaganda role of newspapers, in addition to strengthening the ideological content of articles, it is very important to make them concise, popular, lively, and more in line with the requirements of the majority of readers in form. We have begun to pay attention to this issue and are working hard to improve it.

### 赞成把文章写短些

　　赞成把文章写短些编辑同志：
    近来两次见到人民日报提议把文章写短些，我真赞成极了。原因是我很喜欢读报，只是每逢看到大论长篇的东西，限于时间，或者自己的耐心不够，往往就搁下了。我也常常自行检讨：认为是自己的立场不稳，旧意识深，从兴趣出发，可是归结起来，还是不大能保持下去。这次看到人民日报公开提出这一问题——短些，再短些。我彷佛明白了这不单是我个人的问题，也的的确确是一个文字浪费和时间浪费的问题。
    自然，我们不能强调把所有的文章都故意截短，但也绝不该把文章有意或无意地拉得那么长。过去在某报曾提倡过：尽可能地把第一版上的新闻，编得很精简，使工作忙一些的人们，或文化程度浅些的人们，在不多长的工夫内，就可以得到一个具体的领会。要打算得到一些详实的资料或专门问题就排在第二或第三、四版，这样既不遗漏重要问题，又节约了时间，真是一举两得。所以我的意见是：
    一、编辑部有权删短任何文章，使之精简，以符合读者的要求；
    二、不愿或不能删节的文章，应增加篇幅刊登出来；
    三、公开要求撰稿人员，尽量节省文字，因为费他一个人的一点精力，减少成千成万读者的麻烦，这是应该的；
    四、专门化或较长的文章，应该在定期刊物上发表，尽可能地使那种刊物也普遍起来。		王怡若
    编者按：为了加强报纸的宣传作用，除加强文章内容的思想性外，使其在形式上也能做到精短、通俗、活泼，和更符合广大读者要求，这是一件很重要的工作。我们已开始重视这一问题，并正努力改进。
