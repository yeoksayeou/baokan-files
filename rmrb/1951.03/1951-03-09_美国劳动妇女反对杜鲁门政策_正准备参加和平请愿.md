Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 7th: American women are increasingly participating in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the Truman administration's aggressive policies.

American women actively collected signatures for the Stockholm Appeal, participated in the American National Labor Conference for Peace, and helped establish peace propaganda stations. Currently, working women are preparing to participate widely in the peace petition scheduled for March 15th.

The Women's Peace Committee has played a significant role in the peace movement. It organized three large-scale demonstrations to defend peace last year. In the past few months, thousands of American women have written to members of Congress and local newspapers, expressing their great desire for peace. Recently, women in Los Angeles participated in demonstrations to defend peace with their children, chanting the slogan "We raise our children not to make them murderers." Female members of the National Farmers Union firmly oppose the militarization of the United States. The Women's Committee of Massachusetts protested the remilitarization of West Germany.

American working women, who are subjected to oppression by monopoly capitalists, actively participated in the workers' struggle to increase wages. Currently, 70,000 wool textile workers are on strike in the United States, most of whom are women.

Female members of the Communist Party of the United States are the most active participants in the peace movement, and they are subjected to cruel persecution by reactionaries. Joan Jones, secretary of the Women's Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, recently wrote an article pointing out that American women have a great responsibility to millions of sisters around the world because the threat to world peace comes from American imperialists. She called on American women to strengthen the peace movement.

　　美国劳动妇女反对杜鲁门政策
    正准备参加和平请愿
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社纽约七日讯：美国妇女已越来越多地参加保卫和平以及反对杜鲁门政府侵略政策的斗争。
    美国妇女曾积极地为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名，参加美国全国劳工拥护和平大会，帮助建立和平宣传站。目前，劳动妇女们正在准备广泛地参加定于三月十五日举行的和平大请愿。
    妇女和平委员会在和平运动中起了显著的作用。它在去年组织了三次大规模的保卫和平示威。在过去几个月中，曾有数千美国妇女致函国会议员和地方报纸，表示她们对和平的伟大愿望。最近，洛杉矶的妇女曾带着孩子们参加保卫和平的示威游行，她们高呼“我们抚养子女并非要使他们成为杀人犯”的口号。全国农民协会的女会员坚决反对美国军国主义化。马萨诸塞的妇女委员会曾抗议西德重新军国主义化。
    横遭垄断资本家压迫的美国劳动妇女，积极地参加了工人为提高工资而进行的斗争。现在，美国有七万毛织工人在罢工，其中大多数是妇女。
    美国共产党女党员都是和平运动最积极的参加者，她们受到反动派的残酷迫害。美国共产党妇女委员会书记琼恩斯最近著文指出：美国妇女对于全世界千千万万的姊妹负有极大的责任，因为对于世界和平的威胁是出自美国的帝国主义者。她号召美国妇女加强和平运动。
