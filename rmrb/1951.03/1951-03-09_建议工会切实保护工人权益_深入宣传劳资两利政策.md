　　Suggest Trade Unions Effectively Protect Workers' Rights
    Thoroughly Publicize the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit
    I was very indignant when I saw the "Letters from Readers" column in the People's Daily publishing about the manager of Beijing Mingming Glasses Company, Du Zechen, and the capitalists in private enterprises in Xi'an, Liaodong, and other places oppressing workers. Standing on the proletariat's position, I call on workers across the country to unanimously support these persecuted comrades. Recalling the suffering we workers endured during the reactionary period, it is impossible to finish talking about it. Finally, after liberation, workers have their own government and their own trade unions to protect workers' interests. The Common Program stipulated the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit, which the people of the country unanimously support and implement. But now there are still a few lawless capitalists who still treat workers with feudal and barbaric methods in defiance of the People's Government's decrees, which is intolerable. In addition to asking the government to punish these lawbreakers according to the law, I would like to offer two points for the attention of trade unions in various places: (1) The feudal exploitation of workers by lawless capitalists is historical and universal. It is estimated that this kind of situation still exists in large quantities in various cities after liberation. It is hoped that trade unions in various places can pay close attention to investigation and regularly understand the living conditions of employees in private enterprises, especially small businesses with small scale and few workers and apprentices. (2) Conduct in-depth publicity of the labor-capital mutual benefit policy stipulated in the Common Program and the "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China" in private enterprises, so that capitalists have a correct understanding of this and no longer treat workers with feudal oppression methods.

　　建议工会切实保护工人权益
    深入宣传劳资两利政策
    我看到人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登京市明明眼镜公司经理杜泽臣和西安、辽东等地私营企业资方压迫工人的事件，我非常愤慨。我站在无产阶级的立场，呼吁全国工人一致来支援这些被迫害的同志。回想反动派统治时期，我们工人所受的苦难就谈也谈不完。好容易熬到解放，工人有了自己的政府，有了自己的工会来保障工人的利益，共同纲领中就制定了劳资两利政策，全国人民一致拥护这一正确的政策，执行这一政策。但现在还居然有少数不法的资本家，竟仍以封建野蛮的手段虐待工人，违抗人民政府法令，这是不能容忍的。我除了要求政府对这些犯法分子依法惩治外，并提出两点意见，希望各地工会注意：（一）不法资方对工人的封建剥削是有历史性和普遍性的，解放后这类情形在各城市里估计还是大量存在着。希望各地总工会能够切实注意调查，经常到各私营企业中了解职工的生活情况；特别是应注意规模不大，工人学徒不多的小企业。（二）把共同纲领中所规定的劳资两利政策及《中华人民共和国工会法》在私营企业中进行深入的宣传，使资本家对此有正确的认识，不要再以封建压迫手段来对待工人。
