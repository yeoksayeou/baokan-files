　　Editor's Note: The author of this article raises excellent points regarding the publication of songs in newspapers. He reflects the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers with the current state of song creation. The opinions of the masses are sharp and correct, and their demands are entirely reasonable, deserving the attention of newspaper editors, music workers, and poetry workers. In addition to hoping that local music groups, composers, and writers will recommend excellent song works to us, this publication hopes that national music workers will create more and better songs that truly meet the needs of the masses and promote them through various media such as radio, film, newspapers, and periodicals in a planned manner. This is the primary and serious task facing the national music community today.
　　The vast people of the country often pay close attention to the songs published in newspapers, unanimously believing that singing songs from newspapers will not only align with current political tasks but also quickly provide access to the songs. No matter how rapidly the situation changes, newspapers will provide us with appropriate song materials. As a result, the masses have a deep faith in the songs in newspapers, singing them more and more each day. Some even consider it an honor to be the first to sing songs from newspapers. Thus, in factories, schools, military units, radio stations, and relevant administrative leadership departments, newspapers are consulted first when selecting new songs. In this situation, newspapers have become disseminators of new songs. Especially in the vigorous movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and people from other strata are eager to learn new songs that combine with the current political situation; on the one hand, to sing out their strong will to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country, and on the other hand, through the power of singing, to energize them to complete their work tasks more effectively. Therefore, they want to learn promptly whenever they see a new song in the newspaper. However, some of our newspapers' selected songs have not further met the needs of the masses. As a result, in recent months, fewer and fewer people are singing songs from newspapers. Although those responsible for teaching songs still mostly choose songs from newspapers, those learning the songs either sing without enthusiasm or are unwilling to sing them again after learning them. For the past two years, I have been in charge of the new song teaching program at the Xuzhou People's Broadcasting Station and have gained some understanding of the situation. Below are some reactions from workers, peasants, and soldiers:
　　Workers: "To resist America and aid Korea, the working class across the country has launched a patriotic production competition, responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang advanced team. Why aren't there any songs like that in the newspapers? If there were, we would sing with more enthusiasm, boosting production morale, increasing output and quality, and demonstrating the workers' practical actions while increasing the strength to resist America and aid Korea."
　　"The songs in the newspapers aren't as good as before. The tunes are difficult to learn, and the lyrics are mostly the same, as if they are specifically published for young students. Workers can learn them, but they feel that there is a considerable distance from their own work, so they don't like to sing them."
　　"To resist America and aid Korea, we must take practical action. Recently, the songs in the newspapers have been too exhortative, such as: Advance, Oppose Aggression, Cross the Yalu River, Fight, Fight, Fight, Eliminate the invading beasts in the Pacific... For those of us workers who haven't gone to Korea yet, what actions should we take now to accomplish the above tasks? The lyrics don't specify this very concretely. Occasionally, there are good sentences like 'Machines are weapons, factories are battlefields,' but they account for very little of the entire song."
　　Soldiers: "Of course, some of the songs in the newspapers are good, but when we sing them, we either go out of tune or change the key, so the more we sing, the less enthusiastic we become."
　　"Our troops have begun to move towards regularization. It would be best if the newspapers published songs that combine with tasks such as large-scale training, learning culture, strengthening combat will, strengthening the study of science and technology, and building a strong national defense force. Not only would our millions of regular troops be willing to sing them, but also the nearly ten million militiamen would need these kinds of songs to sing."
　　"Currently, the songs that the nation's soldiers can sing in relative unison are still many old songs from the War of Resistance Against Japan, such as 'The People's Liberation Army March' and 'The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention.' Comrades hope that the newspapers can publish military songs that combine with military tasks and suit the character of soldiers, and it would be even better if they were divided into army, navy, and air force songs. The song 'We Are a Tank Unit' published in the People's Daily on December 13th last year was a good song for comrades learning about tanks."
　　Farmers: "We relied on the leadership of the Communist Party to turn ourselves over, distribute land, and become masters of our own homes. Everyone is very happy in their hearts, and everyone wants to learn a few tunes to sing. We feel a bit tired of the old ones we used to know, like 'Little Cowherd' and 'Sawing the Big Jar,' and we want to learn new songs, but we can't always find suitable ones. We often see songs about resisting America and aiding Korea in the newspapers, and everyone is willing to learn them, but they have too much of a foreign flavor. In a large village of hundreds of households, you can't find a few people who can sing them."
　　"When we were fighting the Japanese devils before, the newspapers often published songs that our farmers could sing. Now the American devils want to invade us again, why don't the newspapers publish songs that our farmers can sing? Sometimes we see songs that seem like farmers' songs, but we can only ask the students in the city to sing them for us to listen to. We can't sing them ourselves."
　　The above reflections of the masses are entirely correct. In the future, when selecting songs for our newspapers, in addition to publishing some songs that are specifically for students, women, or the general public, we should publish a large number of songs that reflect the actual lives and struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and that they can sing. However, in the songs on the theme of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country that have been published in newspapers in various places in recent months, most of them are songs for "all directions," which seem like everyone can sing. But what is the actual situation? Eighty percent of the singers are students, and only twenty percent are workers, soldiers, and other people. Why do so few workers, peasants, and soldiers sing them? The first reason is that the tunes of some songs are difficult to learn and sing. For example, the big song "Peaceful Anger," which occupied most of the supplement in the Shanghai Liberation Daily on November 18th last year, would be very suitable if it were published in a specialized music publication for people with higher musical levels to sing, but it is not appropriate to publish it in a newspaper. In Xuzhou, with a population of nearly 400,000, no one has been heard singing this song. In this way, the political role of newspapers in introducing songs is lost. On the contrary, the masses consider "Comfort Letters Fill the Sky," which was published in the same newspaper on January 14th of this year, to be a good song that combines with their own actions. The second reason is that the lyrics of some songs are empty, generalized, and have too many slogans, which the masses don't like and can't sing with enthusiasm. It is certainly necessary to publish these kinds of songs for "all directions" that everyone can sing in the newspapers, but if there are too many, the masses will feel that they are not intimate. Workers feel that they are not workers' songs, soldiers feel that they are not soldiers' songs, and farmers feel that they are not farmers' songs, which makes it difficult to arouse interest. Due to the above two reasons, although our newspapers have published many songs, very few of them can be widely circulated throughout the country.
　　This proves that the songs in newspapers should start from the actual needs of the masses and pay attention to the singing level of workers, peasants, and soldiers. A work has its own specific object and its own standards of different levels. Newspapers should pay attention to these objective conditions. Therefore, I think that the selection of songs for newspapers should focus on popular works. Generally, attention should be paid to the popularization of tunes, which should be easy to learn and sing, suitable for the tastes of the masses, and the tunes should not be too long and the range should not be too wide. Songs for farmers should pay more attention to the use of folk tunes and ditties. It is best if one person learns it and others can sing it after listening to him sing it a few times. In terms of lyrics, they should be vivid and popular, and strive to express the actual lives and thoughts and feelings of the working people. Pay special attention to selecting songs that praise the great power of the Chinese people, praise combat heroes and labor models, praise patriotic large-scale production to resist America and aid Korea, and praise the new life and new appearance of the countryside. As for songs that are time-sensitive, such as "March 8th," "May 1st," "July 1st," and "August 1st," it is best to publish them several weeks in advance, so that more people can sing them when the time comes. At the same time, attention should be paid to both the tune and the lyrics. In general, not enough attention is paid to the tune. Some very good lyrics cannot be widely circulated because of the influence of the tune.
　　The proofreading of songs must strive for correctness. For example, there are many errors in the tune of the song "Express Our Heart," which was reprinted by Dazhong Daily, and the masses have no way to learn and sing it, which cannot achieve the purpose of publishing songs.
　　Finally, if you are not sure whether to publish a certain song, in addition to consulting music workers, you can also take it to the masses for a test sing first. The masses can provide good opinions. For songs that have been published, it is best to frequently go deep into the masses to understand the situation, which ones are popular and which ones are not, so that we can improve our song selection work in a timely manner.
　　The above points are very likely to be inappropriate, and I hope everyone will study and correct them. Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Korean People's Army's meet.

### 谈谈报纸上登载歌曲的问题

　　谈谈报纸上登载歌曲的问题
    编者按：本文作者对报纸上刊登歌曲的问题提出了很好的意见。他反映了广大工农兵群众，对于目前歌曲创作状况的不满。群众的意见是尖锐的，也是正确的，他们的要求是完全合理的，值得报纸编者、音乐工作者和诗歌工作者的重视。本刊除希望各地音乐团体与作曲家、文学家将优秀的歌曲作品向我们推荐外，更希望全国音乐工作者创作更多更好的、真正适合群众要求的歌曲，并通过各种媒介，如广播、电影、报纸、刊物等，有计划地加以推广，这是目前全国音乐界首要的严重的任务。
    全国广大人民，对于报纸登载的歌曲，经常是很注意的，一致认为今后唱报纸上的歌，既能结合当前的政治任务，又能很快地把歌子拿到手中来，不论形势变化多么快，报纸会给我们一些适当的歌唱材料。由此，群众对报纸上的歌曲，有了深刻的信仰，唱的是一天比一天多，有些人更以先会唱报纸上的歌曲为光荣。于是工厂里，学校里，部队中，电台上，以及有关部门的行政领导干部，每当选择新歌的时候，都是先找报纸，在这样情况下，报纸又成了新歌曲的传播者。尤其在抗美援朝保家卫国这轰轰烈烈的运动中，不论是工人、农民、战士、学生或其他阶层的群众，他们都迫切要求学会几支与当前政治形势相结合的新歌；一方面是为了唱出他们内心对抗美援朝保家卫国的坚强意志，另一方面是通过歌唱的力量，使他们更有劲地完成工作的任务。因此，见到报纸上一旦有了新歌，便想及时学会。可是我们的某些报纸所选登的歌曲，并没有进一步达到群众的要求。因此，近几个月来，唱报纸上歌曲的人，日渐减少，虽然负责教歌的人，仍多选择报纸上的歌，而学歌的人，不是唱不起劲来便是学会后不愿再唱。两年来我在徐州人民广播电台担任教唱新歌曲的节目，了解一些情况。下面是工农兵群众的一些反应：
    工人：“为了抗美援朝，全国工人阶级，都展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，与马恒昌先进小组应战，怎么报纸上没有这样的歌呢？要是有，咱唱起来才对劲，又能鼓舞生产情绪，更能提高产量质量，既表现了工人的实际行动又增加了抗美援朝的力量。”
    “报纸上的歌不如从前好了，曲调不易学，歌词多半相同，好像专为青年学生们登的。工人虽然也可以学，总觉得与本身的工作，有相当大的距离，因此，也就不爱唱了。”
    “要抗美援朝，就得实际行动，近来报纸上的歌，号召性的太多，如：前进，反对侵略，跨过鸭绿江，打打打，把侵略的野兽消灭在太平洋……等，像咱们这些还没到朝鲜去的工人，现在应该用什么行动，才能完成以上的任务呢？歌词就没有很具体的说明，偶而有“机器就是武器，工厂就是战场”这样的好句子，在整个歌词的分量来说，也仅占极少的一点。”
    战士：“报纸上的歌曲，当然有些是好的，可惜到咱嘴上一唱，不是走了音，便是转了调，因此越唱越没情绪。”
    “我们的部队已开始走向正规化，报纸上最好登几支结合大练兵，学文化，加强战斗意志，加强科学技术学习，建设一支强大的国防军等任务的歌子，不仅我们几百万的正规军愿意唱，就是近千万的民兵，也须要这类的歌子唱。”
    “当前全国军人比较统一会唱的，仍然是抗日时期的许多老歌，例如《解放军进行曲》、《三大纪律八项注意》等，同志们都希望报纸上，能登几支结合军事任务的，适合军人性格的军歌，如能分陆军的、海军的、空军的，那就更好。人民日报去年十二月十三日登载的《我们是坦克部队》那个歌对学习坦克的同志们来说，就是一个好歌子。”
    农民：“咱依靠共产党的领导翻了身，分了地当了家，人人心里都是非常的高兴，谁都愿学几个小曲唱唱，从前会的那些新《小放牛》、《锯大缸》等，觉得有点腻了，想学新歌，却总是找不到合适的。常见报上登着些抗美援朝的歌，大家有心要学，可就是洋味道太重，几百户的一个大庄子，找不到几个能唱的人。”
    “从前打日本鬼子的时候，报上常登咱农民能唱的歌，现在美国鬼子又想侵略咱们了，报上怎么不登咱农民能唱的歌了呢？有时见到好像农民的歌，但是那只有请城里的学生们唱给咱听，咱自己唱不了。”
    以上群众的反映，完全是正确的。我们的报纸，在今后选择歌曲上，我认为除了登一些专为学生、妇女，或一般群众都能唱的歌曲外，应大量地登载反映工农兵的实际生活与斗争的，并且是他们能唱的歌曲。但数月以来各地报纸所登载以抗美援朝保家卫国为题材的歌曲中，绝大部分都是《四面八方》的歌子，看起来人人可以唱。而实际情形呢？唱的人百分之八十为学生，仅有百分之二十为工人、战士和其他群众。为什么工农兵群众唱的少呢？第一个原因是某些歌的曲子难学难唱，如：上海解放日报，去年十一月十八日占了副刊大半篇幅的《和平的愤怒》这个大歌，如果发表在专门的音乐刊物上，供给音乐程度较高的人唱，是很合适的，但登在报纸上就不相宜了。以徐州来说，近四十万人口，唱这个歌的，还没听说有那几个人。这样，便失去报纸介绍歌曲的政治作用。反之，在该报今年一月十四日登的《慰问信飞满天》，群众即认为是结合自身行动的好歌子。第二个原因是某些歌的歌词空洞，一般化，标语口号太多，群众不喜欢，唱不起劲来。在报上登些这类《四面八方》的人都能唱的歌子，固然需要，倘数量太多了，就会使群众感到不亲切，工人觉得不是工人的歌，战士觉得不是战士的歌，农民更觉得不是农民的歌，不易引起兴趣。由于上述两个原因，所以我们的报纸虽然登载了不少歌曲，但能在全国普遍流传开的却实在不多。
    由此证明了报纸上的歌曲，应从群众的实际要求出发，应注意工农兵唱歌的水平。一个作品有它一定的对象，也有它一定高低深浅的标准，报纸是应当注意到这些客观条件的。因此我对报纸选择歌曲应以普及的作品为主，一般应注意曲调大众化，易学易唱，适合群众口味，曲子不可太长，音域不可太宽。给农民唱的歌曲，更要注意采用民歌小调，最好有一个人学会了，别人听他唱几遍也能会唱了。在歌词方面应生动通俗，力求表现劳动人民的实际生活与思想情感。特别注意选择歌颂中国人民伟大力量，歌颂战斗英雄和劳动模范的歌子，歌颂抗美援朝的爱国主义大生产，歌颂农村新的生活与新的面貌的歌子。至于有时间性的歌子，如“三八”、“五一”、“七一”、“八一”等，最好提前数星期发表，这样到时候有更多的人能唱。同时应当注意曲词并重。一般情形是对曲子重视不够，有些很好的歌词，因受曲子的影响，所以不能广泛流传。
    歌曲的校对工作必须力求正确，如大众日报转载的《表表咱的一片心》这个歌子的曲子，错误很多，群众实在没法学唱，不能达到刊载歌曲的目的。
    最后，如对某个歌曲是否发表的问题没有把握作决定时，除了请教音乐工作者外，还可以先拿到群众中去试唱一下，群众可以提供很好的意见。对于发表过的歌曲，最好也经常深入群众中了解情况，那些是受欢迎的，那些是不受欢迎的，这样便能使我们的选歌工作能及时改进。
    以上几点意见，很可能有不当之处，希望大家研究指正。中国人导志愿军和朝鲜人民军的会师
