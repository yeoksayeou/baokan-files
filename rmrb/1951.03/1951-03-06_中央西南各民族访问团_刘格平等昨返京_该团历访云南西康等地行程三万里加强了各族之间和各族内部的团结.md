Sixty to seventy members of the first and third sub-delegations departed from Guiyang on the 2nd of this month and returned to Beijing by land. The second sub-delegation, led by deputy head Wang Lianfang, is currently staying in Yunnan for work.

The visiting delegation left Beijing on July 2nd of last year to visit the Southwest region. During their visit, the delegation conveyed the care of Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Central People's Government to the people of all nationalities and presented them with various gifts and banners. The delegation successively visited the people of various nationalities in the Baoshan, Lijiang, Dali, Wuding, Yiliang and other regions of Yunnan Province, 21 counties (cities) including Guiyang, Zunyi, and Zhenyuan in Guizhou Province, and the vast areas of Ya'an, Ganzi, Kangding, Lihua, Xichang, Zhaojue, and others in Xikang Province. The delegation traveled a total of more than 30,000 li in the Southwest region, lasting seven months.

During the visit, in addition to gaining an in-depth understanding of the lives of the people of all nationalities and expressing their condolences, the delegation also assisted local people's governments in organizing training classes for minority cadres and providing medical treatment for minority people. The delegation also directly helped the Tibetan people in the Kangding area of Xikang Province, the Yi people in the Hongmaomagu area of Xichang County, and the Miao people in the Kaili area of Lushan County, Guizhou Province, to establish autonomous regional people's governments. The first sub-delegation also assisted the Yi people in Xikang Province in designing new writing, laying a good foundation for the development of language and writing for the Yi people. Due to the delegation's strict implementation and promotion of the national policies in the Common Program over the past few months, the unity among and within the various nationalities has been strengthened. In Xichang Prefecture, Xikang Province alone, more than 580 Yi people's disputes were mediated by the delegation.

Wherever the delegation went, it was warmly welcomed by the people of all nationalities. Compatriots of all nationalities also entrusted the visiting delegation to bring their precious gifts and banners to Beijing to present to Chairman Mao.
