Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch from New York: Following the illegal execution of seven innocent Black men in Martinsville, Virginia, USA, another innocent Black man, McGee, in Mississippi, has been forcibly charged with "raping" a white woman and sentenced to death on March 20th. This new atrocity has aroused angry protests from people at home and abroad.

A widespread movement to rescue McGee has been launched in the United States. In Washington, American progressives are holding a week-long mass demonstration. The demonstration began on the 13th and will continue until the 20th. The American Civil Rights Congress issued "An Appeal to the Conscience of Americans," urging citizens from all walks of life to participate in this mass demonstration. The appeal stated: "We must awaken the moral conscience of Americans and the world. Americans must no longer stand idly by and watch evil men kill innocent Black people in order to maintain their power. Every act of these evil men violates constitutional freedom and human rights."

In New Orleans, Black and white people jointly held a demonstration to protest.

The Methodist Episcopal Church's Council of Bishops, representing more than two million Black Methodists in various states of the United States, and many prominent Black and white pastors in Boston, have supported the movement to rescue McGee.

Local branches of the United Auto Workers (UAW) of the CIO within the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, local branches of the independent Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, the independent Electrical Workers Union, the Fur Workers Union, and the Warehouse and Distribution Workers Union, have also actively participated in the struggle to rescue McGee.

Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, sent a telegram to Truman on the 14th on behalf of 90 million women in 60 countries, protesting the "particularly cruel and astonishing" sentence against McGee. The Czechoslovak Lawyers Association also sent a protest telegram.

　　美反动派又非法判处一黑人死刑
    美国人民示威抗议
    【新华社十八日讯】纽约消息：继美国弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔七名无辜黑人被非法处死以后，密士失必州的一个无辜黑人麦基，又被强加以“强奸”白人妇女的罪名，被判于三月二十日处死。这一新的暴行已激起美国国内外人民的愤怒抗议。
    美国国内已广泛展开营救麦基的运动。在华盛顿，美国进步人士正在举行为期一周的群众示威。示威已于十三日开始，将一直继续到二十日为止。美国民权保障大会发表《对美国人良心的呼吁书》，敦促各界公民参加这个群众示威。呼吁书说：“我们必须唤起美国人和全世界的道德方面的良心。美国人决不能再袖手旁观地看着邪恶的人们为了维持他们的权力而杀害无辜的黑人们的生命，这些恶人的每一个行为都侵犯了宪法自由和人权。”
    在新奥尔良，黑人与白人联合举行了示威游行，表示抗议。
    代表美国各州二百余万黑人美以美教徒的主教会议以及波士顿许多著名的黑人和白人牧师，都支持营救麦基的运动。
    底特律福特汽车公司内的产联汽车工人工会分会，独立的开采、碾磨及熔炼工人工会各地方分会，独立的电气工人工会，毛皮工人工会，仓库和分配工人工会，也纷纷积极参加营救麦基的斗争。
    国际民主妇联总书记瓦扬——古久里夫人十四日代表六十个国家中的九千万妇女致电杜鲁门，抗议对麦基的“特别残酷而令人惊讶的”判决。捷克斯洛伐克律师协会也发出抗议电文。
