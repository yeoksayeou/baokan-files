　　Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon
    -- Abstract of a Broadcast by Chai Chuanruo, Representative of Returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on the Central People's Broadcasting Station
            I. A Glorious Heroic Story
    After the American invading army suffered its first blow from the combined Chinese and Korean People's forces in northern Korea in October of last year, they were unwilling to give up and continued their offensive. On November 24th, the American invading army, along with its accomplice forces and the Li pseudo-army, a total of over 200,000 troops, launched the so-called "general offensive to end the war," declaring their intention to occupy all of Korea before Christmas (December 25th). The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a counter-offensive on the western front on the 25th, initiating the second strike against the enemy, achieving a great victory. In the battles that secured this victory, Chinese and Korean soldiers created many glorious heroic stories. The story of the Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon is one of the most outstanding of these.
    As the main force of the U.S. Eighth Army was frantically retreating towards Pyongyang, our Volunteer Army suddenly cut off the enemy's retreat south of Gunuri. Thus, an earth-shattering battle ensued. The enemy, with tens of thousands of troops, hundreds of aircraft, over a thousand artillery pieces of various types, and hundreds of tanks, launched a fierce assault on our flanking forces for three days and nights. However, the heroic soldiers of our Volunteer Army, with astonishing bravery and wisdom, defeated the enemy, annihilating and capturing over 10,000 U.S. troops and their accomplice forces, seizing 136 field howitzers, over 300 other artillery pieces, over 4,000 automatic weapons, over 2,000 vehicles and tanks, and large quantities of supplies.
    On November 30th alone, the enemy dropped thousands of artillery shells and bombs on the narrow 300-meter position held by the heroic Guo Zhongtian Platoon, hundreds of aircraft strafed at low altitude, and machine gun fire from enemy tanks and dozens of machine guns completely severed the dense dwarf pine forest. After this, over 300 American soldiers launched three consecutive assaults. But the heroes of the Guo Zhongtian Platoon steadfastly held their ground, continuously repelling enemy attacks, eliminating over 200 enemy soldiers, and then launching a counter-attack, capturing six artillery pieces and fifty-eight intact vehicles loaded with military supplies. They fought for a whole day amidst flying steel and burning smoke, yet suffered no casualties, consuming only 1,305 bullets and 14 grenades.
    Now, let me tell this heroic story from the beginning.
            II. Requesting Combat Missions
    The platoon led by Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian had been in Korea for a month without engaging the enemy. The soldiers were deeply angered by the enemy's acts of burning, killing, raping, and plundering. Each squad and group spontaneously studied political issues in air-raid shelters or during night marches, such as "Truman and Syngman Rhee signed the U.S.-South Korea alliance treaty, preparing to invade and occupy Northeast China and implement U.S.-South Korean co-governance. What should we do?" "We all volunteered to come to Korea to put out the fire. Seeing this fire burning at the doorstep of our motherland, what are we waiting for?"
    In late November, the enemy advanced to Mount Myohyang near Huichon. Further advance would mean crossing the Yalu River. The soldiers could no longer restrain themselves and demanded combat missions to strike the invaders.
    On the morning of November 23rd, soldier Yan Zhenzhang suggested to the entire platoon: "The battalion commander is going to the regimental headquarters for a meeting today, certainly to accept a mission. We had better intercept the battalion commander and ask to fire the first shot."
    After dark, the sentry, who had been waiting for the battalion commander to return, brought him to the platoon from the darkness. The soldiers were overjoyed and asked the battalion commander to assign them the main combat task. But the battalion commander's reply disappointed them. He was not accepting a combat mission at the regimental headquarters today. The naive soldiers continued to plead. The battalion commander was delighted in his heart, but could only patiently persuade them. He said, "Comrades! You are sure to have your chance to fight."
    The battalion commander finally broke through the soldiers' encirclement and returned. The soldiers were still unwilling to give up. They then elected five representatives to go to the battalion headquarters and company headquarters in the middle of the night.
    When the representatives returned to the squad, the battalion leaders had already written a letter, which read: Dear Comrades! Your active request for combat missions is a conscious expression of your patriotism and internationalism, and we are satisfied. We believe that you will be able to complete the arduous and glorious combat mission. Please rest assured that if a combat mission comes, it will be assigned to you. We hope you will do a good job in preparation.
    After the battalion leaders' letter was read, the entire platoon cheered. Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian immediately stated: "I am determined to lead everyone in combat and create a heroic platoon for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country!" The deputy platoon leader, squad leaders, and all the soldiers expressed their determination to kill the enemy.
            III. Overcoming Difficulties is Victory
    After the second strike began, a unit of our Volunteer Army rapidly outflanked towards Tokchon. After two days and nights of rapid march, they crossed more than a dozen large and small mountains. But a larger mountain appeared ahead, with cliffs at an angle of 70 or 80 degrees. There was no road at all, and the mountain was full of thorns and brambles, the habitat of wildcats and beasts. The soldiers knew that they could not achieve a surprise victory without climbing this mountain, so they carried their guns and grabbed the thorns with both hands to climb upwards. Torn clothes and pierced hands were common. Because the formation was dense, those who lost their footing often crushed the people behind them. Sometimes stones rolled down, which was even more dangerous. Chen Xiwu, the fourth squad leader of the Guo Zhongtian Platoon, fell from the most dangerous place and was injured in several places. He gritted his teeth and persisted for more than an hour, finally climbing to the top of the mountain. But like everyone else, his cotton uniform was completely soaked with sweat, his tongue was dry, his mouth was parched, his head was burning, and his scratched skin stung like needles because of the sweat. But he did not complain. He took a deep breath and said excitedly: "Good! I finally climbed to the top of the mountain!" But going down the mountain was no easier than going up, because it was still a steep cliff and you had to face backwards and slide down slowly. If you were not careful, you would still crush a pile of people. Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian's clothes had been torn in more than twenty places, but he continued to encourage everyone: "Comrades! This is the time to test us. Overcoming difficulties is victory!"
    After three hours of crawling and climbing, the vanguard had successfully crossed the high mountain. After going down the mountain, the outside of the cotton uniforms, soaked with sweat, had frozen into ice. The only way to overcome the cold was to run forward. Suddenly, the Taedong River blocked the way ahead. The river was about 300 meters wide, and a thin layer of ice had formed on the surface of the water. Commanders and fighters took off their cotton trousers and waded across the river. From the division commander and regimental commander to the soldiers, everyone had dozens of small cuts on their legs from the thin ice, but no one felt any pain. Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian said: "I don't even know if my legs are still mine."
    After crossing the river, the beach was covered with pebbles. The water flowing down from the legs immediately froze to the bottom of the feet along with the pebbles.
    At this time, the enemy discovered them, and the sound of gunfire rang out from all directions. The Li pseudo-army in the Tokchon area concentrated four regiments of troops, cooperating with 24 aircraft, attempting to annihilate our army. But after two days and nights of fierce fighting, it was not us who were annihilated, but the main force of the Li pseudo-army's Second Army Corps, the 7th Division. Our army annihilated more than 6,000 enemy soldiers, seized all its heavy weapons and a large number of vehicles, and all seven American military advisors were captured.
    The Guo Zhongtian Platoon, like all the units, had not closed their eyes for five days and five nights. Added to this were two days and two nights of fierce fighting, so they should have rested even more. But the soldiers knew that this was only a preliminary victory, and greater victories were still waiting for them. Therefore, with the spirit of a race, they advanced rapidly towards the rear of the U.S. Eighth Army.
    After twelve hours of running forward overnight, they finally arrived at Samin-ri and Ryongwon-ri, 30 li south of Gunuri, at eight o'clock on the morning of the 28th.
    Units of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division were retreating towards Pyongyang in vehicles when our machine gun bullets suddenly hit the enemy's heads. A fierce battle ensued. The enemy bombed and strafed our positions with 62 aircraft, concentrating dozens of artillery pieces and tanks to attack us fiercely. At the same time, the enemy attacking northward from Pyongyang also launched a pincer attack on us with the same firepower and strength. This was an extremely dangerous moment. The enemies from the north and south were only a little more than a mile apart and were about to converge. The enemy poured a large amount of steel on our narrow position. But the fighting will of our great soldiers was stronger than steel. Finally, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, they repelled the enemies from the north and south, and on the evening of the 29th, launched a counterattack to the north.
            IV. Defeating Aircraft and Artillery
    The Guo Zhongtian Platoon had been participating in the battle for a full week. At around one o'clock on the night of the 30th, the troops returned to Ryongwon-ri to continue to build fortifications, preparing to strike the enemy reinforcing from Pyongyang to the north. Four hours later, the fortifications of each squad were completed. This was after seven days and nights of fighting. The soldiers were hungrier and weaker the more they dug, and the more they dug, the more they sweated and the thirstier they became. After finally digging the fortifications, they should have rested. But the soldiers saw the battalion commander looking around in the morning light with binoculars. At this time, the battalion commander had already seen in the binoculars that a large number of vehicles and tanks were driving south from the direction of Gunuri, a dark mass that stretched as far as the eye could see. "Comrades! Quickly move the positions and build fortifications to the north. The enemy from Gunuri is coming again!" Under the urgent orders of the battalion commander, the soldiers forgot their hunger and thirst, and gasped for breath as they dug new fortifications, wishing they could use one shovel as several. Before the new fortifications were completed, enemy tanks and vehicles, one closely following the other, full of American soldiers, covered in smoke and dust, rolled in. The soldiers did not say a word, but continued to dig fortifications in the woods. The enemy's tank unit stopped near the hundreds of vehicles that had been destroyed by our army yesterday. Our soldiers continued to dig fortifications.
    After about half an hour, the enemy began a large-scale movement. It was clear that every three to five vehicles were interspersed with a tank. The comrades of the Guo Zhongtian Platoon suppressed their breathing, and after some of the enemy's vehicles and tanks had passed, a burst of gunfire came from the left, and the machine gun of the Guo Zhongtian Platoon also fired simultaneously, hitting the enemy's vehicles. The enemy's vehicles and tanks were cut into three sections, and hundreds of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and those who were alive only drilled under the vehicles. The soldiers ridiculed happily, "Hit them, the Americans are using meat shield tactics!" Some vehicles were hit and caught fire, and the Americans could be heard screaming.
    Half an hour later, the enemy occupied the high mountain opposite and returned fire, while firing at our positions with machine guns and machine cannons on 80 tanks. Airplanes and artillery also came together. Our position was submerged in smoke. The company commander shouted in the smoke: "Comrades of the Second Platoon, today we will see who can defend more stubbornly, you or the First Platoon!" Guo Zhongtian immediately replied: "As long as I am here, the position of the Second Platoon will be here!" Deputy Platoon Leader Sun Lingtao and all the squad leaders and soldiers expressed their determination to carry out a competition to kill the enemy to the company commander.
    The enemy's tanks rushed forward again. They crushed or pushed the damaged vehicles into the ditch, allowing the vehicles behind to continue to pass. Our fire also continued to fall on the dense enemy. The American soldiers were hit and cried like ghosts and howled like wolves. Suddenly, the enemy's artillery came over. Zhang Xiangzhong, the sixth squad leader of the Guo Zhongtian Platoon, aimed at the enemy's ammunition vehicle and hit the fuel tank. In an instant, the entire vehicle was on fire. Fifteen-centimeter howitzer shells exploded continuously in this mountain valley for two hours. The enemy's vehicles and tanks dared not advance any further.
    Around twelve o'clock, the enemy fired fiercely on our position, cooperating with a large number of aircraft to bomb and strafe frantically, and flying low for reconnaissance. An hour later, the enemy thought that his artillery fire had leveled the mountain, and more than fifty enemies, carrying automatic rifles and carbines, searched and advanced towards our position. Zhang Xiangzhong, the sixth squad leader, was at the forefront. When he saw the enemy coming, he told the whole squad, "Everyone, hold your breath. Wait for them to get close. At my command, riflemen, machine gunners, and grenade throwers fire together!" Sure enough, when the enemy was only about 20 meters away from the position, the soldiers fired a barrage, annihilating all fifty enemies, without letting one go back. The soldiers happily said, "Another meat shield tactic!" Everyone applauded and sang to celebrate the victory.
    The enemy's charge was defeated, and the aircraft and artillery became even more rampant. Hundreds of aircraft dropped a large number of bombs and strafed, also firing rockets and dropping gasoline bombs. Our position was completely turned into a sea of fire. The enemy's aircraft and artillery increased without end. This continued until 2:30 in the afternoon, when more than 200 enemy soldiers launched another fierce attack on us in three directions. This was the most critical moment. Because the enemy was attacking the First Platoon with even greater force, the company commander ordered the Fifth Squad of the Guo Zhongtian Platoon to defend the position of the First Platoon. The number of people in the Guo Zhongtian Platoon's position was therefore reduced by another squad. At the same time, the enemy also fired wildly with machine guns and smoke bombs, as if they wanted to eat this platoon of people in one bite.
    The regimental leaders saw clearly through the binoculars and hurriedly called: "Comrades of the Second Platoon of the First Company, this mountain is related to the overall situation. We hope that you will resolutely hold it and create a heroic platoon for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country!" The battalion leaders immediately sent a messenger to convey this order. Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian, Fourth Squad Leader Chen Xiwu, and Sixth Squad Leader Zhang Xiangzhong unanimously expressed their determination to the battalion and regimental leaders: "As long as I am here, the position of the Second Platoon will be here!" When the enemy approached, Yan Zhenzhang, a crack marksman, aimed and fired, killing nine enemies with eleven shots. Zhang Xiangzhong, the sixth squad leader, immediately proposed the slogan: "Learn from the crack marksman Yan Zhenzhang, kill an enemy with one bullet!" When the enemy advanced to only about 50 meters from our main position, Zhu Gaopin, a 17-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, bravely advanced 30 meters to the right front and chose a more favorable position. When Zhu Zhenwu saw this, he shouted: "Learn from the Communist Youth League member Zhu Gaopin, only advance, no retreat!" Zhu Gaopin immediately shouted back: "We Communist Youth League members must test ourselves in battle and learn from the Communist Party members!" It was in this chorus of slogans that the enemy had rushed to within about 30 meters of us. At Guo Zhongtian's command, all the firepower was unleashed, more than half of the 200 enemies were killed or wounded, and they retreated in panic again. Our guns were firing more accurately. The Americans were suppressed under our firepower and dared not even lift their heads. The soldiers became even happier and shouted in unison: "This group of meat shield tacticians are here to die again!" Our position became more active.
    The soldiers of the Fifth Squad, who reinforced the First Platoon's position, were warmly welcomed by the comrades of the First Platoon. The soil blown up by the bombs buried the Fifth Squad Leader Ma Yi. He crawled out of the soil and shouted: "Don't be afraid of airplanes! Annihilate the enemies on the ground!" The slogan "Learn from the Fifth Squad of the Second Platoon!" immediately rang out on the First Platoon's position.
    The enemy launched a third major bombing, and the artillery fire was even more concentrated. By four o'clock, the enemy launched a third attack. This time, the enemy was obviously losing confidence and advanced very slowly. But as before, dozens of enemy soldiers were wiped out.
    The Guo Zhongtian Platoon fought fiercely with the enemy under intense firepower and repeated attacks for a whole day. After dark, the commanders came to the position of the Second Platoon to understand the situation of the Second Platoon and see if they could continue to fight. But when Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian gathered his entire platoon and called their names, he said happily: "Reporting to the leaders, we have not lost a single person; except that the Fifth Squad Leader's ears are a little deaf, there are no casualties!" He also checked the consumption of today, a total of 1,305 bullets and 14 grenades were fired.
    They exchanged a very small consumption for the enemy's consumption that was a thousand times greater than their own. In front of their position lay more than 200 American corpses, not counting those who were killed in the vehicles and dragged away.
            V. Victory! More Victory!
    After the battle, Guo Zhongtian led the entire platoon to hold a battle review meeting. From the practical experience, the soldiers came to the conclusion about the enemy: "Before, we only heard that the American soldiers were paper tigers, but we were not sure in our hearts. Now we have finally broken the paper tiger." "The Americans have many airplanes, many artillery pieces, many tanks, many vehicles, and they run fast; these are their characteristics. But they lack a spirit of sacrifice, and each one is more afraid of death than the other; they are afraid of close combat, afraid of night combat, afraid of encirclement, afraid of outflanking, afraid of machine guns, and afraid of grenades; they can neither attack nor defend, they are a group of cowards."
    Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian's comment on the entire platoon was: "Every soldier is brave, like a little tiger, and will devour the enemy as soon as they are released." The soldiers' comment on the platoon leader was: "Our platoon leader commands well, chooses the positions well, digs the fortifications well, organizes the firepower well, has strict shooting discipline, and combines command and encouragement, which makes us fight more and more vigorously."
    But at the same time, the soldiers of the Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon also reviewed two major shortcomings in this battle: The first shortcoming was: "After fighting for eight or nine days, we did not capture a good prisoner of war, and those we captured were all half-dead guys." The company commander said: "You fought a defensive battle, so not capturing prisoners is not a shortcoming." No one in the entire platoon agreed with the company commander's words, and everyone unanimously resolved: "The entire company plans to capture 50 to 100 American soldiers this time, and our platoon did not capture even one, so we must make up for it in the next battle." The second shortcoming was: "We did not completely destroy or completely capture the tanks." So the entire platoon immediately signed up to join the tank-fighting daredevil team, determined to strive for greater victory. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　郭忠田英雄排
    ——中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若在中央人民广播电台的广播词摘要
            一、一个光辉的英雄故事
    美国侵略军去年十月间在朝鲜北部遭受了中朝人民部队的第一次打击之后，不肯死心，还要继续进攻。十一月二十四日，美国侵略军纠合其帮凶军及李伪军二十多万人，发动所谓“结束战争总攻势”，声言要在圣诞节（十二月二十五日）前占领全朝鲜。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军于二十五日在西线发动反攻，发动了对敌人的第二次打击。获得了伟大胜利。在获得这个胜利的战斗中，中朝战士们创造了许多光辉的英雄故事。郭忠田英雄排的故事，就是这些英雄故事中特出的一个。
    当美第八军主力慌忙向平壤总溃逃的时候，我志愿军某部突然在军隅里以南切断了敌人的退路。于是惊天动地的战斗便发生了。敌人以数万之众，附飞机数百架，各种炮千余门，坦克车数百辆，向我迂回部队猛攻三昼夜。我志愿军英雄的战士们，却以惊人的勇敢和智慧，打败了敌人，歼俘美军及其帮凶军一万多人，夺获野榴炮一百三十六门，其他炮三百余门，自动火器四千余件，汽车、坦克车两千余辆及大批供应品。
    在十一月三十日一天之内，敌人光是对英雄的郭忠田排所扼守的三百米狭小的阵地上，就投下大炮弹和炸弹数千颗，成百架飞机低飞扫射，敌人坦克车上的机关炮和数十挺机关枪，把密集的矮松林全部腰斩，汽油弹把阵地烧焦。在这之后，就是三百多美军连续发动三次冲击。但是郭忠田排的英雄们始终坚守着阵地，屹然不动，连续打退敌人进攻，歼敌二百多人，接着又发起反击，夺获大炮六门及满载军用品的完好汽车五十八辆。他们在钢铁飞迸和烟火焚烧中整整打了一天，自己却无一伤亡，仅消耗子弹一千三百零五发，手榴弹十四枚。
    现在让我把这个英雄故事，从头说起。
            二、要求战斗任务
    郭忠田排长所率领的一个排，到朝鲜一个月了，没有与敌人交手。战士们每天看到敌人烧、杀、淫、掠的暴行，非常激愤。各班各组在防空洞里或在夜行军中，都自发地研究着政治问题，例如“杜鲁门与李承晚签定美韩同盟条约，准备侵占中国东北，实行美韩共管，咱们应该怎么办？”“咱们都是志愿到朝鲜来救火的，眼看着这火烧到祖国的大门口了，咱们还待在这里干什么？”
    十一月下旬，敌人进犯到熙川附近的妙香山，再往前进就是鸭绿江了。战士们实在忍不住了，纷纷要求战斗任务，予进犯者以打击。
    十一月二十三日早晨，战士阎镇章向全排建议：“营长今天到团部去开会，一定是接受任务，咱们最好接住营长，要求先打头一炮。”
    天黑以后，专等营长回来的哨兵从黑暗里把营长请到排里。战士们高兴极了，要求营长交给主要作战任务。但是营长的答复使他们失望，他今天到团部去，并不是接受战斗任务的。天真的战士们，还是继续要求。营长心里很欢喜，但只有苦口婆心地慢慢地说服他们。他说：“同志们！保险有你们打的。”
    营长终于突出战士们的重围回去了。战士们依然不能甘心。他们又推选五位代表，黑天半夜到营部和连部去。
    代表们回到班里，营首长们已经写来一封信，信里面说：亲爱的同志们！你们积极要求战斗任务，这是你们爱国主义与国际主义的自觉表现，我们感到满意。我们相信你们能够完成艰巨的光荣的战斗任务。请你们放心，如果战斗任务来到，一定交给你们。希望你们做好准备工作。
    营首长们的信宣读了以后，全排欢呼。排长郭忠田立即表示：“我决心率领大家作战，创造抗美援朝保家卫国英雄排！”副排长、正副班长和全体战士都表示了杀敌决心。
            三、克服困难就是胜利
    第二次打击开始以后，我志愿军某部向德川迅速迂回。经过两昼夜急行军，翻过十几道大山小岭，但前面却又出现一座更大的山，都是斜度七八十度的悬崖峭壁，根本没有路，满山荆棘丛生，是山猫野兽出没的所在。战士们知道非爬过这座大山不能出奇致胜，便都背着枪，两手抓住荆棘，往上攀登。衣服被扯烂，两手被刺破，是普遍的现象。由于队形密集，失足者常常把后面的人压成一堆。有时石头滚了下来，更加危险。郭忠田排的四班长陈锡武从最危险的地方跌下去了，负伤数处。他咬着牙，经过一个多钟头的坚持，终于爬上山顶。但他和所有的人一样，棉衣已给汗水全部浸湿，舌干口渴，头顶冒火，被擦破的皮肤，因为出汗的关系，和针刺一样发痛。但他没有叫苦。他长呼一口气，兴奋地说：“好！我总算爬上了山顶！”但是下山并不比上山容易，因为仍是悬崖陡壁，必须把脸朝后慢慢地向下滑，一不小心，仍要压倒一堆人。排长郭忠田的衣服，已经扯破二十几处，但是他仍不断地鼓励大家：“同志们！这是考验我们的时候，克服困难就是胜利！”
    经过三个钟头的匍匐攀登，前卫部队已胜利地越过高山。下山以后，被汗水湿透的棉衣外部，又冻成了冰。克服寒冷的唯一办法，就是跑步前进。忽然前面大同江挡住了进路。江宽约三百米，河水表面已结成一层薄冰。指战员们脱掉棉裤涉水过河。从师长团长直到战士，每个人的腿上都被薄冰划破几十条小口子，却没有一个人感觉疼痛。郭忠田排长说：“我已经不知道我的腿还是自己的了。”
    过了大河，河滩上遍地都是小石头。从腿上淌下去的水，马上连小石头一起冻结在脚底上。
    这时，敌人发觉了，枪炮声从四面八方响起来。德川一带的李伪军集中四个团的兵力，配合二十四架飞机，妄想将我军消灭。但是经过两昼夜激战，结果被消灭的不是我们，恰好是李伪军第二军团主力第七师团的大部。我军共歼灭敌人六千多名，夺获它的全部重武器和大批汽车，七个美军顾问也全被俘虏了。
    郭忠田排和所有的部队一样，五天五夜没有合眼了。加上中间两天两夜的激战，似乎更应该休息了。但是战士们知道这只是初步的胜利，更大的胜利还在等待着，因此便以赛跑的精神，向美第八军的后方急进。
    经过一夜十二个钟头的跑步前进，终于在二十八日早晨八时，到达军隅里以南三十华里的三新里和龙源里。
    美第二师部队正在坐上汽车向平壤撤退，我们的机关枪子弹，忽然打在敌人的头上。激战便展开了。敌人以六十二架飞机炸射我阵地，集中数十门大炮和坦克车向我猛攻。同时，南边由平壤向北进攻的敌人，也以同样的火力兵力向我夹击。这是万分危险的时候。南北两面的敌人，只剩下一里多路，就要会师了。敌人以大量的钢铁，倾泻在我们这个狭窄的阵地上。但是我伟大战士的战斗意志，比钢铁还要坚强。终于经过两昼夜激战，打退了南北两面的敌人，并且在二十九日黄昏向北发起反击。
            四、战胜飞机大炮
    郭忠田排参加战斗整整一个星期了。三十日夜晚一点钟左右，部队回到龙源里继续加修工事，准备打击由平壤向北增援之敌。四个钟头以后，各班的工事都修好了。这是经过七昼夜作战以后的事情。战士们越挖越饿，越饿腰越软，越挖越出汗，越出汗越渴。好容易挖好了，应该休息一下了。但战士们却看见营长拿望远镜在晨曦中四处张望。这时营长已经在望远镜中，看见军隅里方向的敌人，向南开来大批的汽车和坦克，黑压压的一片，一眼望不到头。“同志们！赶快转移阵地，加修向北的工事，军隅里的敌人又来了！”在营长的紧急命令下，战士们忘记了饥渴，喘着粗气又挖掘新的工事，恨不得把一柄锹当几柄锹来用。新工事还没挖好，敌人的坦克车加汽车，一辆紧接着一辆，满坐着美国兵，乌烟瘴气，滚滚而来。战士们一个也不作声，只管在树林里继续挖工事。敌人的坦克部队，走到昨天被我军打坏的百十辆汽车附近，忽然停了下来。我们的战士，仍然继续挖工事。
    约莫过了半个钟头，敌人开始大规模运动了。看得很清楚：每三辆到五辆汽车中间，夹着一辆坦克。郭忠田排的同志们都压制着气息，等到敌人的汽车和坦克开过一些后，一排的枪声从左方传了过来，郭忠田排的机关枪，也同时射出火鞭，落到敌人的汽车上。敌人的汽车和坦克。被切成了三段，兽兵死伤数百人，活着的也只管向汽车下面钻。战士们高兴地嘲笑着说，“打吧，美国人是肉蛋子战术！”有些汽车被打得燃烧起来，只听见美国人在惨叫。
    半个钟头以后，敌人占领了对面的高山，以火力向我还击，同时以八十辆坦克车上的机关炮和机关枪，向我阵地射击，飞机大炮也一齐来了。我阵地被淹没在烟雾中。连长在烟雾中大叫：“二排的同志们，今天看你们和一排谁守得顽强！”郭忠田立即答复：“有我在就有二排的阵地在！”副排长孙凌涛以及所有的班长战士，都向连长表示了进行杀敌竞赛的决心。
    敌人的坦克车，又向前冲了。他们把已经打坏的汽车压碎或推进沟里，让后面的汽车继续开过。我们的火鞭，也继续落在密集的敌人身上。美国兵被打的鬼哭狼叫。忽然敌人的炮队开过来了。郭忠田排六班长张祥忠瞄准敌人的炮弹车，把汽油箱打着了，霎时间全车燃烧起来。十五公分的榴弹炮弹，在这山沟里连续爆炸起来，延续了两个钟头。敌人的汽车和坦克车都不敢前进了。
    十二点左右，敌人以炮火向我猛击，配合大量飞机疯狂炸射，低飞侦察。一个钟头以后，敌人以为他的炮火已经把山头打平了，五十多个敌人，端着自动步枪和卡宾枪，向我阵地搜索前进。六班长张祥忠在最前面，他看到敌人来了，告诉全班，“大家沉住气，等他到跟前，听我的命令，步机枪手榴弹一齐开火！”果然等到敌人离阵地只有二十米左右的时候，战士们一阵猛打，把五十多个敌人全都消灭了，没有放回一个。战士们高兴地说：“又是肉蛋子战术！”大家鼓着掌，唱着歌，庆祝胜利。
    敌人的冲锋被打垮了，飞机大炮更加猖狂起来。成百架的飞机，大量投弹扫射，还打火箭炮，丢汽油弹。我阵地完全变成火海。敌人的飞机大炮有增无已，这样持续到下午二时半，二百多敌兵，又分三路向我实行猛攻。这是最危急的时候。因为敌人以更大的兵力向一排攻击，连长命令郭忠田排的第五班调守一排阵地。郭忠田排的阵地上，因此又减少了一班人。敌人同时又用机枪和烟幕弹狂射，好像要一下子把这排人吃了似的。
    团首长在望远镜中看得清楚，连忙打电话：“一连二排的同志，这个山头关系全局，希望你们坚决守住，创造抗美援朝保家卫国英雄排！”营首长立即派通讯员传达这个命令。排长郭忠田，四班长陈锡武，六班长张祥忠，一致向营团首长表示决心：“有我在，就有二排的阵地在！”当敌人接近的时候，特等射手阎镇章，瞄准射击，十一枪打死了九个敌人。六班长张祥忠立即提出口号：“向特等射手阎镇章看齐，一发子弹打死一个敌人！”当敌人进到离我主阵地只有五十米达左右时，十七岁的青年团员朱高品，向右前方勇敢前进三十米，选择了一个更加有利的阵地。朱振武看见了，便喊：“向青年团员朱高品学习，只有前进，没有后退！”朱高品立即答喊：“我们青年团员要在战斗中考验自己，向共产党员看齐！”就在这此起彼落的口号声中，敌人已冲到离我三十米左右了。郭忠田一声号令，所有的火力全部怒放，二百多敌人，死伤过半，又狼狈回窜了。我们的枪打得更准了。美国人被压在我火力网下，连头也不敢抬。战士们更加高兴起来，一齐喊：“这群肉蛋子战术家又来送死了！”。我们的阵地上，更加活跃起来。
    增援一排阵地的五班战士们，受到一排同志们的热烈欢迎。炸弹炸飞的泥土把五班长马义埋住了，他从土里钻出来，大喊：“不要害怕飞机！消灭地上的敌人！”一排阵地上随即响起口号：“向二排五班学习！”
    敌人又来第三次大轰炸，炮火更加集中。到四点钟，敌人又发动第三次进攻，这回敌人显然已经失去信心，进得非常迟缓。但是和前两次一样，几十个兽兵又被消灭殆尽。
    郭忠田排在敌人强烈火力下与反复冲击的敌人激战一整天。天黑以后，指挥员们都到二排的阵地上来了解二排的情况，看看他们能不能继续战斗。但是当郭忠田排长把他全排集合起来点名以后，他很高兴地说：报告首长，我们一个人也没有少；除了五班长的耳朵有些震聋而外，没有一个伤亡！”他又清查了一下今天的消耗、共打了一千三百零五发子弹和十四个手榴弹。
    他们以很小的消耗，换取了敌人千百倍于自己的消耗。在他们的阵地面前，躺着二百余具美军尸体，打死在汽车上被拉走的还没有计算在内。
            五、胜利！再胜利！
    战斗结束以后，郭忠田领导全排举行战斗检讨会。战士们从实战经验中，得出了对敌人的结论：“以前光听说美国兵是纸老虎，但是心里没有底，现在总算把纸老虎打破了。”“美国人飞机多，大炮多，坦克多，汽车多，跑得快；这些算是他的特点。但是他们缺乏牺牲精神，一个比一个怕死；他们怕近战，怕夜战，怕包围，怕迂回，怕机关枪，怕手榴弹；他们既不能攻，又不能守，是一群怕死鬼。”
    排长郭忠田对全排的评论是：“战士们个个勇敢，都像小老虎似的，一放出去就要吃掉敌人。”战士们对排长的评论是：“我们的排长指挥得好，阵地选择得好，工事挖得好，火力组织得好，射击纪律严格，还有指挥与鼓动结合，使我们越打越起劲。”
    但同时，郭忠田英雄排的战士们对这次战斗又检讨出两大缺点：第一个缺点是：“打了八九天，没有捉到一个好俘虏兵，捉到的都是些半死不活的家伙。”连长说：“你们打的是守备战，没有俘虏不算缺点。”全排没有一个人同意连长的话，大家一致决议：“全连这次计划活捉五十个到一百个美国兵，我们这一排连一个都没有捉到，下次战斗一定要补上来。”第二个缺点是：“没有把坦克车完全打坏或完全缴到。”于是全排当即全体报名，参加打坦克奋勇队，决心争取更大的胜利。【新华社】
