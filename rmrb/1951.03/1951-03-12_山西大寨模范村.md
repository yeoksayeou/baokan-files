Introducing Production Increase Plans

　　Shanxi Dazhai Model Village

　　Last year already exceeded the pre-war level by thirty-six percent, this year striving to raise it by another twelve percent.

　　Dazhai Village in Yushe, Shanxi, a famous model village that overfulfilled its production increase task last year and whose production level has already exceeded the pre-war level by more than thirty-six percent, has formulated this year's agricultural production plan, requiring a further increase in output of twelve percent on the existing basis.

　　Dazhai Village is one of the famous model villages in Shanxi Province. Last year, the village produced a total of 1,306 shi and 3 dou of grain, with an average grain yield per mu exceeding 2 dou and 7 sheng before the war. Farmers have generally become prosperous. Now, out of the 53 households in the village, 24 households have a total of 330 shi of grain in storage, and 5 households have enough grain to eat for three years. Based on this foundation, this year's agricultural production plan mainly aims to further increase the yield per unit area, requiring the village average to increase by twelve percent compared to last year, with better land increasing by 2 dou of grain per mu. In addition, the farmers in the village also plan to reclaim 550 mu of beach wasteland and fallow land this year, plant trees and afforest 50 mu, and plant 30,000 trees for protecting banks and fields. The village plans to breed 39 young livestock from 39 cows and donkeys and raise 15 more sows.

　　The specific measures taken by the village to achieve this plan are as follows: (1) Further improve farming techniques: The village plans to improve 600 mu of soil, adding 300 dan of soil per mu (sand soil for alkaline land, red soil for white land), repair 300 mu of land, and build 650 mu of new embankments. All village land will be plowed three times and harrowed four times on average, and wheat fields will be hoed once. Labor mutual aid teams will universally use new-style farm tools, aiming to cultivate 30 percent of the village land with new-style farm tools. (2) Prevent and control diseases and insect pests: All kinds of seeds will be universally soaked in warm water and medicine, removing weeds and insect eggs from the edges of fields and embankments to prevent or reduce the occurrence of diseases and insect pests. The village supply and marketing cooperative plans to purchase more than 2,000 jin of various pesticides. (3) Continue to promote improved varieties: The village plans to sow 950 mu with improved varieties of grain such as "811" and "Bailiusa," as well as "812" sorghum and foreign white beans. Labor model Zhang Zhiquan is responsible for establishing a 1.5 mu "small farm" to conduct fertilizer application and improved variety experiments, and 30 farm households are specially invited to conduct variety promotion experiments. A technical guidance team will be established to strengthen technical guidance to the village. (4) Increase fertilizer application: Except for a small portion of black bean land that will not be fertilized, an average of 85 dan of fertilizer per mu is required, an increase of 5 dan compared to last year. Wheat fields will be universally top-dressed once.

　　Editor's Note: The production increase plan of Dazhai Village in Shanxi is the beginning of the old liberated areas' farmers responding to this year's call for striving for a bumper harvest with practical actions. All rural areas with conditions should arrange this year's production increase within a certain plan, so that when combined, a nationwide production increase movement can gradually be formed. We welcome various regions to submit various typical plans to this newspaper for publication.

专栏：增产计划介绍

　　山西大寨模范村
    去年已超过战前百分之三十六，今年争取再提高一成二。
    超额完成去年增产任务、生产水平已超过抗战前百分之三十六以上的山西榆社大寨村，已制订了今年农业生产计划，要求在现有基础上，提高产量一成二。
    大寨村为山西省著名模范村之一，去年全村共产粮一千三百零六石三斗，每亩平均产粮超过抗战前二斗七升，农民已普遍走向富裕。现在，全村五十三户中，有二十四户共存粮三百三十石、有五户存粮足够三年食用。在这样基础上，今年该村农业生产计划主要为进一步提高单位面积产量，要求全村平均比去年增产一成二，较好的土地每亩增产二斗粮。此外，该村农民并计划今年开垦滩荒和熟荒五百五十亩，植树造林五十亩，植护岸林、护田树三万株。全村计划从三十九头母牛、母驴中繁殖幼畜三十九头，并增养母猪十五口。
    该村实现这一计划的具体措施如下：（一）进一步提高耕作技术：全村计划改良土壤六百亩，每亩垫土（碱地垫沙土，白土地垫红土）三百担，修地三百亩，打新埝六百五十亩。全村土地平均作到耕三耙四，麦地普遍锄一次。以劳动互助组为单位，普遍使用新式农具，要达到在全村百分之三十的土地上用新式农具耕种。（二）防治病虫灾害：各种种籽普遍用温汤和药剂浸拌，铲除地边、地埝杂草、虫卵，防止或减少病虫害的发生。村供销社计划购买各种农药二千余斤。（三）继续推广优良品种：全村计划播种“八一一”、“白榴沙”谷种和“八一二”高粱、洋白豆等优种九百五十亩。由劳动模范张志全负责，建立一亩半的“小农场”，进行施肥、改良品种试验，并特约三十户农家作推广品种实验。成立技术指导小组，加强对全村技术的指导。（四）增施肥料：全村除少部黑豆地不施肥外，要求每亩平均施肥八十五担，比去年增加五担。麦地普遍施追肥一遍。
    编者按：山西大寨村的增产计划，是老解放区农民以实际行动响应今年争取丰收号召的一个开始。凡是有条件的农村，均应将今年的增产安排在一定的计划之内，这样汇合起来，可以逐渐形成全国性的增产运动。我们欢迎各地将各种典型的计划寄交本报发表。
