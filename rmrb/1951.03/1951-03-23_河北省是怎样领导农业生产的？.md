Editor's Note: At the National Agricultural Work Conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government from February 14th to 27th, representatives from major administrative regions and provinces reported on typical experiences and actual situations in various regions. These experiences are of great significance for promoting the patriotic production movement and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture nationwide this year. We now publish excerpts of the reports from regional representatives, organized as follows:

How does Hebei Province lead agricultural production?

Zhang Jiguang, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Hebei Province

I. On the issue of technology promotion

I. In the process of gradual recovery and development of the rural economy, the masses have a very urgent need for technology. This is reflected in two aspects:

	1. The masses demand strengthened technical guidance and warmly welcome technical cadres. Cadres in various places have reported that leading production without technical knowledge is no longer feasible. The masses are more affectionate towards technical cadres than towards general administrative cadres; it is more difficult for ordinary administrative cadres to convene a meeting in the countryside, while it is easy for technical groups, technical research committees, etc., to convene a technical research meeting, and participation is very enthusiastic. The head of the Dingxian Special District farm frequently goes to the countryside to guide technology and has a close relationship with the farmers, enjoying high prestige among the masses. This shows that connecting with the masses through production technology can gain their sincere support.

	2. The masses demand new technologies. Through the technology promotion work in 1950, especially the results of promoting new scientific pesticides and machinery in the prevention and control of diseases and pests, farmers have a new understanding of pesticides and sprayers. Jiliuying Village in Shijiazhuang City alone requested 100 sprayers. At the recent Provincial People's Congress, representatives from various places requested loans to purchase 45,000 sprayers. Beidu Village in Shijiazhuang City even requested 10,000 jin of fertilizer. The technical pamphlets that labor models brought back from the provincial conference were highly cherished by the masses and almost impossible to retrieve once circulated.

II. In order to meet the needs of farmers, various methods should be used to bring technology to the countryside and improve the technical level of farmers.

	1. The first is to train technical cadres. Since December 1950, various places have launched the work of universally training cadres, village cadres, and labor models who lead production. By the end of January, incomplete statistics from only Handan, Xingtai, Baoding, Dingxian, and other special districts showed that more than 20,000 people had been trained. The training content mainly included pest and disease prevention and control, as well as farming techniques. Our preliminary experience is: (1) Break away from the old book learning circle and focus on practical operation. Through everyone's actual operation, such as preparing lime-sulfur mixture, cotton oil emulsion, etc., achieve the requirement that everyone can speak, do, and teach, thus achieving good results. (2) For the training of village cadres and labor models, the best method is to conduct roving training in Piancun (a unit composed of several nearby villages for easy production leadership), which can save expenses, reduce disruption to production, and is welcomed by the masses, achieving great results. (3) Grasp the season to carry out technical training. Technology cannot be learned at once. In each production season, combine with real objects and operations to conduct training, so that trainees can truly master the technology and immediately promote current work. (4) Charts and small cards are the best training materials. And practical teaching is most welcomed by the masses. For example, currently, more than 2,000 agricultural construction assistants from special districts and county farms have gone down, holding corn stalks damaged by borers and various insect pest charts, explaining the damage caused by borers, and splitting the corn stalks to let the masses see the insects inside, effectively promoting the work of burning corn stalks and corn stalks for pest control. Once scientific and technological methods are understood and mastered by the masses, they can play a great role in pest control and increased production.

	2. Strengthen the leadership of professional organizations, educate technical extension personnel to face the masses, and promptly summarize the technical experience of the masses. In the past, experimental research institutions such as farms did not pay enough attention to the technical requirements of the masses, so many valuable experiences of the masses could not be summarized in time. For example, wide-row sparse planting of cotton is better than dense planting, and Handan and Linqing farms and the masses have good experience; another example is that in the past, only sandy loam soil was suitable for cotton planting, but now the masses have created the experience of planting cotton in alkaline land and planting cotton in clay soil. These experiences are very good, but no specific summary has been made.

	3. Be good at using and giving play to the strength of technical cadres and labor models. Technical cadres are different from administrative cadres, and the two must be combined, but there must be some differences in use. Last year, in the pest control movement, some areas fixed technical cadres in certain villages to do organizational work like administrative cadres, which prevented them from playing a good role in technical guidance. Some areas did better, with technical cadres roving to guide and help various places establish drug distribution stations, and after teaching the technology in one area, they switched to another area. After the technical cadres taught the technical team or labor models in a Piancun, the administrative cadres did the organizational work and widely let the labor models promote the technology, which yielded the greatest results.

II. Launch emulation campaigns and establish high-yield banners

The emulation campaign is a mass line working method for leading production. It is also an important method for establishing high-yield banners and encouraging the broad masses of farmers to carry out high-yield competition movements.

Last year, various places competed to plant cotton, which made the masses realize that planting cotton is profitable. A village in Shahe became a rich village because of promoting cotton planting. This played a great role in planting wheat and retaining cotton fields and expanding cotton fields after autumn last year.

Some areas compared mutual aid, which fully proved that mutual aid is stronger than individual farming. For example, the Li Xianglin mutual aid group in Huangjiatun, Xingtai, gave full play to labor efficiency, hoeing cotton seven times and millet and sorghum four times, and the crops grew very well. Farmer Li Boxiang in the village did not join the mutual aid. He did not have time to harvest the wheat when it was ripe, and it suffered from wind disasters. He also could not hoe the autumn seedlings, resulting in two acres of land being barren. Mutual aid groups such as Liu Qingyun in Shahe and Zhang Xishun in Daming combined sideline businesses, improved technology, and increased output, making the broad masses have a conscious mutual aid requirement.

Some areas realized from the evaluation that it is necessary to pay attention to technology when planting crops. Those who prune and top crops are stronger than those who do not, and those who select seeds grow very uniformly, thus greatly promoting seed selection and wheat soaking techniques.

Various places select various model figures through evaluation, and high-yield banners can be widely established among the masses, so that the local masses have a goal to strive for, who has the highest crop yield, why is it the highest, find the reasons and experience, and let everyone learn how to achieve the purpose of high yield. High-yield banners cannot be inserted in reverse on the land of farms, because farmers will say: farms have good conditions, big manure and diligent water, we cannot compare. The enthusiasm of farmers to compare with farms is small. If mass production increase banners can be established, the masses will be jealous, and the enthusiasm for comparison is great. Only model demonstrations selected by the masses have a large demonstration effect, are more in line with mass productivity, and have the best promotion efficiency. And the labor models selected after evaluation are most convinced by the masses. Last year, Shahe selected 119 labor models on the basis of evaluation. The masses reflected: "This year's selection is good and fair," showing great conviction, and the enthusiasm of the labor models was also very high.

III. Production issues in different regions

In the past, we only took care of the production of general areas and ignored the production problems in areas with special conditions such as cash crop areas, mountainous areas, and water areas. For example, in cotton-producing areas, there were problems of insufficient supply of food, livestock feed, and fertilizers. If these problems can be effectively solved, they will definitely play a role in promoting the development of cotton production. Generally speaking, in cotton-producing areas, it is necessary to promote the planting of high-yielding crops, such as Okinawa No. 100 sweet potatoes, which generally yield 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, and as much as 9,000 jin, which can be used as a non-staple food to replace some staple food, and can also be used to raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer; it can also be promoted to plant alfalfa, which yields 3,000 jin per mu per year, to solve livestock feed (now some farmers in cotton-producing areas buy livestock when planting cotton, and sell them after the agricultural work is over because there is no grass to feed, which affects fertilizer accumulation), and can also accumulate more fertilizer; it is possible to improve the yield of wheat in many ways, such as pest control, prevention of wheat scab, more fertilization, and irrigation, in order to increase the yield per unit area of wheat and reserve more cotton fields; in addition, the fuel problem must also be solved by supplying a large amount of coal through supply and marketing businesses.

The main problem of production in mountainous areas is that there are many people and little land, and the soil is thin and stony. Therefore, it is also necessary to promote high-yielding crops, such as sweet potatoes and potatoes; the promotion of mountain goods and material exchanges, such as black dates, persimmon cakes, and medicinal materials in some mountainous areas cannot be brought out of the mountains, and should be properly resolved to stimulate the development of their reproduction. Some mountainous areas that can develop cash crops should develop them in large quantities. Improve economic strength and improve farmers' lives, such as Fuping produces tobacco leaves, but the planting technology and varieties are poor, and the problem of changing to good varieties and tobacco curing technology should be solved. Now each jin of cured tobacco leaves is worth eight jin of millet, and each mu can yield at least 150 jin of tobacco leaves, which is equivalent to 1,200 jin of rice. Excluding the cost of planting cured tobacco, each mu can yield 700 or 800 jin of rice, which is equivalent to the production of several mu of other crops. This can be exchanged for daily necessities and improve life. In addition, for areas where agricultural development is very difficult, their main source of livelihood should be shifted to the development of animal husbandry, and organizing cattle and sheep to go down the mountains to exchange for necessities of life is also a method. In addition, some can develop mountain silkworms, domestic silkworms, mining, and medicinal herb picking, which can also solve some of the people's lives in mountainous areas. In short, a way out should be found from various production methods. The main reason for the poverty of mountain people is that material exchanges have not been developed, and a large number of mountain goods, medicinal materials, and minerals have not had more sales channels and cannot be exchanged for living materials. The people's production enthusiasm has been reduced and they have fallen into a long-term poverty-stricken life. It is not simply that the land is barren and the people are poor, the mountains are poor and the water is bad, and the natural conditions are not good, but how to develop material exchanges between mountain and plain areas and arrange mountain production according to local conditions.

Water areas should promote the development of various aquatic crops, such as rice, reeds, cattails, lotus roots, and water chestnuts. In some areas, such as Anxin, some villages have been flooded for many years, but they are rich in reeds, and the lives of the masses are very good, higher than in general areas. These undertakings need government promotion and material support. In terms of sideline businesses, weaving, shipbuilding, fishing, and fish processing should be vigorously organized for the masses to develop.

专栏：

    编者按：在二月十四日至二十七日，由中央人民政府农业部召开的全国农业工作会议上，各大行政区和各省的代表，报告了各地典型经验与实际情况。这些经验对于推动爱国生产运动，争取今年全国农业丰收，有着极大的意义。现将各地区代表的报告，择要整理发表如下：
　　河北省是怎样领导农业生产的？
    河北省农林厅厅长  张继光
    一、关于技术推广问题
    一、在农村经济的逐步恢复与发展的进程中，群众对技术的要求是很迫切的。这表现在两方面：
    １、群众要求加强技术领导，对技术干部热烈欢迎。各地干部都反映了领导生产不会技术，已经吃不开了。群众对技术干部比对一般行政干部更亲切；普通行政干部下乡召集一个会议较困难，而技术小组、技术研究委员会等召集一个研究技术的会很容易，并且参加的很热烈。定县专区农场场长经常下乡指导技术，与农民的关系很密切，在群众中威信很高。这说明从生产技术上联系了群众，便能得到群众的热诚拥护。
    ２、群众要求新的技术。经过一九五○年的技术推广工作，特别是防除病虫中推广新的科学药械的结果，农民对农药、喷雾器有了新的认识。石家庄市只留营村一个村即要求喷雾器一百架，在最近的省人民代表会议上，各地代表要求贷买喷雾器四万五千架。石家庄市北杜村一个村更要求肥田粉一万斤，各地劳动模范自省开会回去后，带的技术小册子，群众非常热爱，传出去几乎收不回来。
    二、为了满足农民的需要，要通过各种办法使技术下乡，提高农民技术水平。
    １、首先是训练技术干部。自一九五○年十二月开始，各地展开了普训领导生产的干部、村干部和劳动模范工作。到一月底统计，仅邯郸、邢台、保定、定县等几个专区不完全统计，已训练两万多人。训练内容主要是病虫害防除及耕作技术等。我们的初步经验是：（一）打破旧的书本学习的圈子，着重实际操作。通过每个人的实际操作，如配制石灰硫磺合剂、棉油乳剂等，达到每个人都会说会作会教的要求，因而成绩很好。（二）村干劳动模范的训练，以片村（按系几个靠近的村子所组成的便于领导生产的单位）巡回训练方式最好，既可节省开支，又可少误生产，群众欢迎，收效很大。（三）要掌握季节，开展技术训练。技术不可能一次学会，要在每个生产季节，结合实物及操作，进行训练，使受训者切实掌握技术，并能立即推动当前工作。（四）训练材料，以挂图与小型卡片最好。并且实物教学群众最欢迎，如目前各专区、县农场及区农业建设助理员已有两千余人下去，拿着受钻心虫害的谷楂，和各种虫害挂图，一面讲钻心虫的为害情况，并将谷楂劈开，让群众看其中的虫子，有效地推动了烧谷楂玉米秸进行防虫工作。科学技术方法，一旦为群众所了解所掌握，便可在防虫增产上发挥极大作用。
    ２、加强专业组织的领导，教育技术推广人员面向群众，并及时总结群众的技术经验。过去农场等试验研究机关，对群众中的技术要求注意不够，因而有许多群众的宝贵经验，不能及时予以总结。例如植棉宽垄稀植比密植好，邯郸临清两农场和群众都有很好的经验；又如过去只有砂质壤土适宜植棉，现在群众又创造了碱地植棉和在粘土中植棉的经验，这些经验都很好，但未能作出具体总结。
    ３、善于使用与发挥技术干部和劳动模范的力量，技术干部与行政干部不同，二者必须是结合的，但在使用上又必须有所区别。去年在防虫运动中，有些地区技术干部与行政干部一样，被固定在一定的村子作组织工作，这样使他不能很好发挥技术指导作用。有的地区作的较好，技术干部巡回指导，帮助各地建立配药站，在一个地区教会了技术之后，又换一个地区。技术干部在一个片村教会技术小组或者劳动模范后，即由行政干部作组织工作，广泛放手运用劳动模范来推广技术，收效最大。
            二、开展评比运动、树立丰产旗帜
    评比运动是领导生产的群众路线的工作方法。也是树立丰产旗帜鼓舞广大农民群众开展丰产竞赛运动的重要方法。
    去年各地比种棉，使群众认识到种棉收益大，沙河某村因提倡种棉，穷村变成了富村。这对去年秋后种麦留棉田，扩大棉田面积上起了很大作用。
    有的地区比互助，充分证明了互助比单干强，如邢台黄家屯李相林互助组，发挥了劳动效率，棉花锄了七遍，谷子、高粱都锄了四遍，庄稼都长得很好。该村农民李伯祥没加入互助，麦子熟了来不及割，遭了风灾，秋苗也锄不过来，结果荒了二亩地。沙河刘清云、大名张希顺等互助组，结合副业，提高了技术，增加了产量，使广大群众有了自觉的互助要求。
    有些地区从评比中认识到种庄稼必须讲技术，整枝打杈的就比不打杈的强，选过种的就长得很齐，因而大量推广了选种及种麦浸种等技术。
    各地通过评比选出各种模范人物，在群众中就可广泛的树立丰产旗帜，使当地群众有个奋斗目标，谁的庄稼产量最高，为什么最高，找出原因和经验，让大家学会如何才能达到丰产目的。丰产旗帜不能反插在农场的土地上，因为农民会说：农场条件好，粪大水勤，我们不能比。农民和农场来比的劲头要小，如能树立了群众的增产旗帜，群众就要眼红，比的劲头很大。只有群众选出的模范示范作用大，与群众生产力更切合，推广效能也最好。而经过评比后选出的劳动模范，群众最服气。去年沙河在评比的基础上选出劳动模范一一九人，群众反映：“今年选的好，真公平”，表现了很服气，劳动模范们的情绪也十分高涨。
            三、不同地区的生产问题
    过去我们只照顾了一般地区的生产，忽略了经济作物区及山区、水区等特殊条件地区的生产问题。如在产棉区发生了粮食、牲口草料、以及肥料的供应不足的问题。这些问题若能得到有效的解决，对发展棉花生产上，定能起推动作用。一般地说，在产棉区应提倡种多产作物，如冲绳百号甘薯，每亩一般收三、四千斤，多的到九千斤，可以作为副食品，代替一部食粮，又可养猪积肥；也可提倡种苜蓿，每亩年产三千斤，解决牲口草料（现在棉区有些农民种棉时买牲口，农活过去因无草喂就卖掉，这就影响了积肥），同时也能多积肥料；可以从多方面提高小麦的产量，防虫、防疸、多施肥、灌水等，求得小麦单位面积上增产，以多留出棉田；此外燃料问题也须通过供销业务大量供应煤炭。
    山区的生产，主要是人多地少石厚土薄，故也应提倡多产作物，如甘薯、马铃薯等；山货的推销，物资交流，如有些山区黑枣、柿饼、药材出不了山，应予以适当解决，刺激其再生产的发展。有的山区能发展经济作物的，应大量发展。提高经济力量，改善农民生活，如阜平产烟叶，但种植技术及品种差，应解决改换良种与烤烟技术问题。现在每斤烤烟叶合小米八斤，每亩至少能收一百五十斤烟叶，合米一千二百斤，除去种植烤烟成本外，每亩收七、八百斤米，也等于好几亩其他作物的生产，这样便可换回日用必需品，得到生活的改善。此外发展农业很困难的地区，其生活主要来源即应转向畜牧的发展，组织牛羊下山换回生活必需品也是一个办法。此外有的可以发展山蚕、家蚕、开矿、采药，也可解决山区人民生活一部问题。总之应从各种生产方式方法中找出路。山地人民生活贫困的主要原因，是物资交流没有开展起来，大批山货药材、矿石等还没有较多的销路，不能换回生活资料，人民生产情绪降低，而陷于长期贫困的生活，并不单纯的是地瘠民贫，穷山恶水，自然条件不好，而是如何开展山地平原物资交流，与因地制宜的按排山区生产的问题。
    水乡区应提倡发展各种水产作物，如种稻、苇、蒲、藕、菱角等，有的地区如安新，有些村子多年水淹，但盛产苇，群众生活很好，比一般地区生活还要高些。这些事业需要政府提倡，并予以物质支持。在副业方面的编织业、造船、打鱼、鱼类加工等均应大力组织群众开展。
