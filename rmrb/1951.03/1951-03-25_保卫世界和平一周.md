　　Week of Defending World Peace
　　Indian and Ceylonese Youth Volunteer to Resist America and Aid Korea
　　The U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea has aroused widespread anger among the Asian people. Following the righteous action of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting America and aiding Korea, young people from India and Ceylon have expressed their willingness to go to Korea to fight alongside the Korean and Chinese People's forces against the American aggressors.
　　Recently, in Bombay, about fifty young people told the All-India Student Federation that they were willing to go to Korea to fight against the American aggressors; in East Punjab Province, twelve university students requested the Indian government to provide them with facilities to go to Korea and participate in the Korean people's struggle against American aggression. Twenty-five young people from Ceylon wrote to the All-India Student Federation, expressing their "burning anger and unbearable indignation" at the crimes of U.S. imperialism in its insane slaughter and destruction in Korea, and prepared to fight alongside their Asian brothers on the Korean battlefield for the freedom of the Asian people.
　　Prior to this, in December of last year, three hundred Indian youths, including veterans, students, and workers, jointly wrote to the Delhi Democratic Youth League, requesting to volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war of resistance against America. In January of this year, twenty-five prominent figures, including Harkishan Singh Yadava, the chief writer of the United Provinces (India) "Lachina" newspaper, wrote to the Indian government, requesting facilitation to go to Korea immediately to fight against the likes of MacArthur. Their letter stated: "Asia can no longer silently listen to the cries of the slaughtered Korean women and children."
　　The righteous act of Indian and Ceylonese youth volunteering to resist America and aid Korea demonstrates the Asian people's strong hatred for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia and their firm will to resist the American aggressors. The Chinese people and the Asian people's active support for the Korean people's struggle for liberation will surely shatter U.S. imperialism's dream of conquering Korea and Asia.
　　Japanese People Sign Petition for Overall Peace Treaty
　　The signature campaign demanding the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and opposing rearmament has been enthusiastically launched throughout Japan. As of March 7, Kyoto Prefecture had collected 300,000 signatures. In Tokyo alone, the number of signatories had reached 500,000 by the end of February. When collecting signatures in various places, Japanese democratic parties, trade unions, student groups, religious groups, and people from all walks of life participated in this movement with great enthusiasm. In the factories in the Tokyo-Yokohama area, workers participating in the Social Democratic Party also jointly conducted the signature collection movement with members of the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party.
　　Burmese People Strengthen the Struggle for Peace
　　With the rise of the world peace movement, on March 11 of this year, the Burmese Peace Defense Conference held a peace demonstration rally of more than a thousand people in Rangoon. The participants in the conference firmly expressed their determination to safeguard the cause of peace, and unanimously passed three resolutions protesting the slander of the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor," defending world peace, and opposing the militarization of Burma. At the same time, the conference called on all the people of Burma to fight against U.S. imperialism's launching of a war of aggression.
　　U.S. "Peace Crusade" Petition Movement
　　The U.S. government's insistence on its criminal policy of aggression and expansion of aggression is increasingly arousing the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people. The American people's movement against the war of aggression against Korea and demanding peace is growing.
　　On March 15, 2,500 representatives from thirty-six U.S. states participating in the "Peace Crusade" gathered in Washington. Representatives speaking at the meeting all demanded that the United States hold negotiations with the Soviet Union and China to maintain peace.
　　One thousand five hundred participants in the "Peace Crusade," wearing white dove badges, visited the U.S. Congress, demanding that the U.S. government end the Korean War and withdraw U.S. troops from Korea.
　　The "Peace Crusade" also sent a delegation to petition the U.S. government and congressmen, demanding the defense of peace. On the evening of the 15th, the delegation met with Russell, a representative of U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, handed over a peace petition, and strongly protested the U.S. aggression and arbitrary behavior towards Korea, China, and Germany, while demanding negotiations with China and the Soviet Union.
　　Those participating in the peace petition included about three hundred union leaders, about five hundred members of the American Women's Association for Peace, and representatives from groups such as the American Slavs, the Labor Youth League, the American Jewish Labor Conference, and the "American Veterans for Peace Association."

　　保卫世界和平一周
    印度和锡兰青年志愿抗美援朝
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的罪行，激起了亚洲人民的普遍愤怒。继中国人民志愿抗美援朝的正义行动之后，印度和锡兰的青年纷纷表示志愿去朝鲜和中朝人民部队并肩作战，抗击美国侵略者。
    最近，在孟买约有五十名青年向全印学生联合会表示，愿意到朝鲜去抗击美国侵略者；在东旁遮普省有十二名大学生请求印度政府给予便利，使他们能到朝鲜去，参加朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的斗争。锡兰的二十五名青年致书全印学生联合会，表示对美帝国主义在朝鲜疯狂屠杀和破坏的罪行，“怒火中烧，忍无可忍”，准备在朝鲜战场上和亚洲兄弟们并肩为亚洲人民的自由而战。
    在此以前，去年十二月，包括退伍军人、学生和工人的三百名印度青年，曾联名写信给德里民主青年联盟，要求志愿去朝鲜参加朝鲜人民的抗美战争。今年一月，印度联合省《拉契挪》报主笔哈健姆辛格·耶达夫等二十五位著名人士写信给印度政府，要求给予便利，立即去朝鲜对麦克阿瑟之流作战。他们的信里写道：“亚洲再也不能无言地听着被屠杀的朝鲜妇女们和儿童们的呼喊了。”
    印度和锡兰青年志愿抗美援朝的正义行为，表明了亚洲人民对美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略的强烈憎恨，和抗击美国侵略者的坚强意志。中国人民和亚洲人民积极支援朝鲜人民解放斗争，必将粉碎美帝国主义妄图征服朝鲜和亚洲的迷梦。
    日本人民签名争取全面和约
    要求缔结全面和约和反对重新武装的签名运动，在日本各地已经热烈展开。京都府至三月七日止已征集到三十万个签名。东京一地在二月底签名者已达五十万人。在各地征集签名时，日本民主党派、工会、学生团体、宗教团体及各界人民都以极大的热情参加了这一运动。在东京——横滨地区的工厂中，参加社会民主党的工人也与共产党和劳农党的党员共同进行征集投票运动。
    缅甸人民加强争取和平的斗争
    随着世界和平运动的高涨，今年三月十一日，缅甸保卫和平大会在仰光举行了一千余人的和平示威大会。参加大会的人坚决表示了他们维护和平事业的决心，并一致通过抗议诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”、保卫世界和平和反对缅甸军事基地化三项决议。同时，大会号召全缅甸人民为反对美帝国主义发动侵略战争而斗争。
    美国“和平十字军”请愿运动
    美国政府坚持侵略与扩大侵略的罪恶政策，日益引起美国广大人民的不满。美国人民反对侵朝战争要求和平的运动，正在成长中。
    三月十五日，美国三十六州参加“和平十字军”的二千五百名代表，在华盛顿集会。会上发言的代表都要求美国与苏联和中国举行谈判保持和平。
    一千五百名佩带着白鸽徽号的“和平十字军”参加者，访问了美国国会，要求美国政府结束朝鲜战争，自朝鲜撤退美国军队。
    “和平十字军”并派出代表团向美国政府及议员请愿，要求保卫和平。代表团于十五日晚会见了美国国务卿艾奇逊的代表鲁塞尔，递交了和平请愿书，强烈地抗议美国对朝鲜、中国和德国的侵略与专横行为，而要求与中苏两国举行谈判。
    参加和平请愿的有工会领袖约三百人，美国妇女争取和平协会会员约五百人，美籍斯拉夫人、劳动青年联盟小组、美国犹太劳工会议与“美国退役军人争取和平协会”等团体的代表。
