OPEC crude oil production decreases

	Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 3

	According to figures released by the International Energy Agency on February 3, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produced an average of 19.4 million barrels of crude oil per day in January this year, a decrease of 3.4 million barrels per day compared to December last year, which had a daily production of 22.8 million barrels.

	However, this production level is still 900,000 barrels per day higher than the 18.5 million barrels per day limit set by the OPEC ministerial meeting in November last year.

	Statistics from the International Energy Agency show that Iran and Iraq, which had long been in dispute over production quotas, both complied with their respective quotas in January this year, each producing 2.6 million barrels per day. Except for countries like the United Arab Emirates, Gabon, and Ecuador, most other OPEC member countries also did not exceed their allocated production quotas.

　　欧佩克原油产量下降
    新华社巴黎２月３日电  据国际能源机构３日发表的数字，石油输出国组织（欧佩克）今年１月份的原油平均日产量为１９４０万桶，比去年１２月份的日产２２８０万桶减少３４０万桶。
    但是，这一产量仍比去年１１月欧佩克部长级会议确定的日产１８５０万桶的限额高出９０万桶。
    国际能源机构的统计显示，过去曾因产量配额问题长期争执不下的伊朗和伊拉克两国，在今年１月份都遵守了各自的配额，即每天２６０万桶；除阿拉伯联合酋长国、加蓬和厄瓜多尔等国外，欧佩克大多数其他成员国的原油产量也未超出规定的配额。
