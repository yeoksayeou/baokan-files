Since the outbreak of the international debt crisis in 1982, many developing countries have hoped to resolve the debt issue through economic development. The introduction of the U.S. "Baker Plan" in 1985 marked the recognition by the major Western creditor countries of this claim by developing countries. However, after the "Baker Plan" was proposed, commercial banks did not increase their loans to debt-ridden countries, and the debt burden of developing countries remained very heavy. Despite significant efforts by the broad debt-ridden countries in economic adjustment, their economies still struggled to achieve healthy development. Under this situation, the call for debt relief from many debt-ridden countries has been very strong. Some enlightened individuals in Western countries and international financial institutions have also begun to seriously consider this issue.

Finding practical and feasible ways to alleviate the debt burden of the broad debt-ridden countries is currently the focus of the international debt problem.

The prominent feature of the current international debt situation is the stark contrast between the long-term economic stagnation of debt-ridden countries and the significant reduction in debt exposure by international creditor banks.

In 1988, the external debt of the major debt-ridden countries in developing countries began to decrease, but the countries were still far from escaping the prolonged economic predicament. The main manifestations are long-term low economic growth, resurgent inflation, heavy repayment burdens, and the reversal of capital flows. According to a report released by Morgan Trust Bank at the end of last year, compared to 1987, the total debt of the 15 heavily indebted countries mentioned in the "Baker Plan" (proposed in 1985) decreased from $509 billion to $505 billion. However, economic growth fell from 2% to 0.8%, the inflation rate rose from 116% to 223%, and the interest payments of the 15 countries increased from $38 billion in 1987 to $41 billion, more than double the amount of loans signed by international commercial banks to the 15 debt-ridden countries since 1985.

The economic situation in Latin America, the region with the heaviest debt burden, is also severe. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the region's total debt decreased from $410 billion in 1987 to $401 billion in 1988, but the inflation rate increased significantly compared to 1987, reaching a record high of 470%, while economic growth was 0.7%. Last year, Latin American countries paid $30 billion in principal and interest to industrialized countries, exceeding the trade surplus. This outflow of funds hindered economic growth and affected domestic accumulation and investment. In response to this situation, the finance ministers of the eight Latin American countries proposed at their meeting in November that reducing the outflow of funds to the outside world has become an indispensable condition for correctly implementing economic policies and starting sustained economic growth.

In contrast to the difficulties faced by debt-ridden countries, the economic situation of international commercial banks has been improving. A Federal Reserve official recently testified before the House Banking and Financial Services Committee that the risk faced by the U.S. banking system due to the massive debt owed by developing countries has significantly decreased. Statistics show that the outstanding loans of U.S. commercial banks to the 15 major debt-ridden countries have decreased from $90 billion in 1982 to $76 billion in 1988. Due to high bank profits, major banks have increased their loan risk reserves. The total capital of nine U.S. banks has increased from $32 billion in 1983 to $65 billion. The chairman of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation believes that it is now seemingly unlikely that U.S. banks will go bankrupt due to the debt of developing countries.

How to reduce the debt burden? Many people internationally have proposed the idea of commercial banks waiving part of their claims, but commercial banks will not accept this. The idea of the eight Latin American countries is to have the debt-ridden countries, creditor countries' governments, and international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank jointly raise funds to form a multilateral institution. By utilizing the current discount in the debt market, old debts can be purchased, new debts issued, and the nature of the debt changed, thereby reducing the debt burden. Western countries' governments are also unwilling to adopt this proposal. The reason is that they cannot use taxpayers' money to purchase these debts, transferring the risk that originally belonged to commercial banks to the public.

However, many people in the U.S. have already noticed that the long-term deterioration of the economy in debt-ridden countries, especially in Latin American countries, has affected the political stability of these countries. It is now time to consider the debt issue from a political perspective. In fact, the U.S. government's policy has shown some subtle changes. Last year, the U.S. government provided Mexico with a $3.5 billion emergency loan and pressured the World Bank to provide Argentina, which could not repay its debt on time, with a $1.25 billion loan. Some people believe that this move indicates that Washington's immediate priority seems to have shifted from helping major banks stabilize their positions to maintaining political stability in Latin America. After Bush was elected, he expressed that he would re-examine the debt issue. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. debt policy may undergo further relaxation. Of course, the debt issue is complex and involves many aspects, and how to reduce the debt burden will be a tortuous process.

　　减轻负担：国际债务问题的焦点
    本报记者  朱满庭
    自１９８２年国际债务危机爆发以来，许多发展中国家曾希望通过发展经济解决债务问题。１９８５年美国“贝克计划”的提出，标志着西方主要债权国承认了发展中国家的这一主张。但“贝克计划”提出后，商业银行并没有增加对债务国的贷款，发展中国家的债务负担仍然十分沉重。广大债务国尽管在经济调整方面作出了极大努力，经济仍难以走上健康发展的道路。在此形势下，不少债务国要求减轻债务负担的呼声十分强烈。一些西方国家和国际金融机构的有识之士也开始认真考虑这个问题。
    寻求切实可行的办法减轻广大债务国的债务负担，是目前国际债务问题的焦点。
    当前国际债务形势中的突出表现是，债务国的经济长期停滞与国际债权银行的债务奉献大大减少形成了鲜明的对照。
    １９８８年，发展中国家主要债务国的外债虽然开始下降，但各国远未摆脱旷日持久的经济困境。其主要表现是，经济长期低速增长，通货膨胀压而复起，支付负担依然沉重，资金逆向流动不见扭转。据美国摩根信托银行去年底发表的一份报告，与１９８７年相比，１９８８年美国“贝克计划”（１９８５年提出）中提到的１５个重债国外债总额从５０９０亿美元下降到５０５０亿美元。但经济增长却从２％跌落到０．８％，通货膨胀率由１１６％升至２２３％，１５国的利息支出由１９８７年的３８０亿美元上升到４１０亿美元，是１９８５年以来国际商业银行向１５个债务国签署提供的贷款额的两倍多。
    债务负担最沉重的拉美地区经济形势也较严峻。据联合国拉美经委会的统计，１９８８年全地区债务由１９８７年的４１００亿美元降至４０１０亿美元，但通货膨胀率较之１９８７年大幅度上升，高达创纪录的４７０％，而经济增长为０．７％。去年拉美国家向工业国家偿还本息的纯资金高达３００亿美元，超过了外贸顺差。这种资金外流阻碍了经济增长，影响了国内的积累和投资。针对这一情况，去年１１月拉美８国集团财长会议提出，减少资金向外部转移已成为正确贯彻经济政策，使经济开始持续增长的必不可少的条件。
    与债务国的困难局面相反，国际商业银行经济情况却不断好转。美国联邦储备委员会的一位官员最近在众议院银行和金融委员会上作证时说，美国银行系统因发展中国家积欠的巨大债务所遭受的风险已大大减少。据统计，美国商业银行对１５个主要债务国的未清偿借款已从１９８２年的９００亿美元下降到１９８８年的７６０美元。由于银行利润高，各大银行纷纷提高了贷款风险储备金。美国９家银行的总资金已从１９８３年的３２０亿美元增加到６５０亿美元。美国联邦储蓄保险公司董事长认为，现在（美国银行）因发展中国家的债务而破产已似乎不太可能。
    债务负担怎么减？国际上不少人士已提出让商业银行放弃部分债权的主张，商业银行当然不会接受。拉美８国集团的设想是，由债务国、债权国政府以及国际货币基金组织、世界银行等国际金融机构共同筹集资金，组成一个多边机构，利用当前债务市场上的折扣，收购旧债务，发行新债权，改变债务的名目，这样债务负担才能减下来。对这个主张，西方国家政府也不愿采纳。理由是不能用纳税人的钱购买这些债务，把本来是商业银行的风险转嫁到公众头上来。
    不过，目前美国朝野许多人士已经注意到，债务国特别是拉美国家经济长期恶化，已影响到这些国家的政治稳定，现在是从政治角度考虑债务问题的时候了。实际上，美国政府的政策已出现某些微妙的变化。去年，美国政府向墨西哥提供了３５亿美元的紧急贷款并向世界银行施加压力，向不能如期还债的阿根廷提供了１２．５亿美元贷款。一些人士认为，此举表明华盛顿的当务之急似乎已从帮助各大银行稳住阵脚转向保持拉美地区的政治稳定。布什当选后表示，他将重新检查债务问题。由此看出，美国的债务政策可能发生进一步的松动。当然债务问题牵涉面很广，情况很复杂，债务负担如何减下来，将是一个曲折的过程。
