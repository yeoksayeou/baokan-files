Rice Becomes a Staple in the Homes of Heilongjiang People

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 27th - (Reporter Liu Changjin) The residents of various cities and towns in Heilongjiang Province, who have long relied on coarse grains as their staple food, now consider rice a common part of their daily meals.

Entering the 1980s, with the continuous improvement of agricultural water conservancy facilities and the rapid development of agricultural science and technology, the province's rice research personnel have promoted the large-scale application of cold-region rice dryland seedling techniques. Through the use of plastic film covering and chemical measures, they have solved key problems in rice production such as low-temperature cold damage, pest and disease infestations, and weed control in rice paddies. This has resulted in a steady annual increase in the province's rice yield per unit area.

　　大米成黑龙江人家常饭
    据新华社哈尔滨２月２７日电  （记者刘常金）一直以粗粮为主食的黑龙江省各城镇居民，如今把大米当成了家常便饭。
    进入８０年代，随着农田水利设施的不断改善和农业科学技术的迅速发展，这个省的水稻科研人员大面积推广寒地水稻旱地育苗等技术，并通过地膜覆盖和药物措施，解决了水稻生产中低温冷害、病虫害和稻田草害等关键问题，使全省水稻单产逐年稳步增长。
