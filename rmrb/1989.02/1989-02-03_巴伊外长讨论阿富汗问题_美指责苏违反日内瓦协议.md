The Pakistani Foreign Minister discusses the Afghanistan issue. The U.S. accuses the Soviets of violating the Geneva Agreement.

	New York, February 1 - The U.S. State Department spokesman, Redman, said today that the Soviet Union's intensified bombing in Afghanistan violates the Geneva Agreement on Afghanistan, and the U.S. expresses concern over this.

	Redman, at a press conference, said that Soviet fighter jets frequently bomb Afghanistan, escalating the conflict. He accused the Soviet military of destroying numerous Afghan villages along the withdrawal route and killing many civilians. He said this is unprecedented.

	Redman said that the Soviet Union's military actions during its withdrawal violate the assurances it gave to the U.S.

During the talks, the two foreign ministers also discussed bilateral relations and some regional and international issues. They expressed satisfaction with the cooperative relationship between the two countries in all aspects and hoped that this cooperation could be further expanded.
