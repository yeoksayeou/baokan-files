This incident, although it happened nearly a year ago, is still fresh in the minds of the police officers of the Laiyang Public Security Bureau in Shandong Province. During the Snake Year's Spring Festival, they were still reading the "two letters" from the Dragon Year's Spring Festival. One was written by farmer Gong Benzhen to the bureau chief Jiang Shoumin, and the other was written by Jiang Shoumin to the heads of various departments, stations, and squads in the bureau.

Jiang Bureau Chief:

I am Gong Benzhen from Heitouzhuang Town, Yexi County. On February 6, 1988, I and another person carried two boxes of firecrackers on bicycles to Laiyang to sell. When passing through the north of Yujiazhuang Village in Chengxi, they were confiscated by Clam Zhenjun of Bailinzhai Police Station. He asked me to pay 200 yuan to get the firecrackers back, but I had no money. After confiscating the firecrackers, there was no receipt or other procedures. Later, through someone's mediation, only one box was returned to me, and the other large box was not returned. They planned to use it themselves. My large box of firecrackers has 40,000 heads, worth 400 yuan. This is the hard work of my whole family! Is there such a regulation from higher authorities? I hope Bureau Chief Jiang will give a reply and handle this matter.

Farmer Gong Benzhen

To all department, station, and squad heads:

Yesterday, I received a letter from the people, reflecting the problem of the Bailinzhai Police Station's officers seizing and confiscating items without issuing receipts or turning them in. This must be seriously noted by all officers in the bureau. Otherwise, we will damage the image of the public security organs and public security officers, and even make mistakes or fall into the pit of crime. Strictly demanding of officers is, in my opinion, a true show of care.

Of course, the letter writer's private production and sale of firecrackers are illegal. But here, I mainly emphasize that seized and confiscated items cannot be privately handled, and it is not allowed to confiscate without proper procedures.

Please pass this spirit on to all officers and conduct a thorough check on any problems in this regard. Because we have reached the time to shout loudly.

Jiang Shoumin

Upon investigation, it was found that Clam Zhenjun indeed did not provide legal procedures to Gong Benzhen for the confiscated firecrackers, and did not properly manage the confiscated firecrackers, which were taken away by local village cadres. However, there were no other disciplinary violations.

The bureau's party committee decided to hold a meeting of all officers to read the "two letters" and report to the entire city's public security system for criticism; the bureau's disciplinary inspection group and relevant leaders ordered Clam Zhenjun to write a deep self-criticism; the missing part of the confiscated firecrackers will be compensated by Clam Zhenjun; the results of the handling will be informed to Gong Benzhen, and the confiscation procedures will be supplemented.

Afterward, some officers thought this matter was overblown and the handling was too severe. Some even whispered behind his back: "Jiang Shoumin is quite ruthless."

Regarding this, Comrade Jiang Shoumin said: "If someone dares to do this, it's not ruthless; if not ruthless, one would forget what one is doing!"

Since Jiang Shoumin's "ruthlessness," there has not been a single case of law-breaking or disciplinary violation among the officers in the entire bureau. Last year, the city's criminal case clearance rate reached 87%, with a clearance rate of over 95% for major cases. As for Clam Zhenjun, his work has also shown significant improvement. When the city's public security bureau brought back the award for the city's advanced unit at the end of last year, even those who initially thought Jiang Shoumin was "ruthless" couldn't help but smile...

　　两封信引起的……
    金言
    这事儿，虽然过去快一年了，但山东省莱阳市公安局的干警们却一直不敢忘记。蛇年春节期间，他们仍在读龙年春节时那“两封信”。一封是农民宫本贞写给公安局长江守民的，一封是江守民写给本局各科、所、队长的。江局长：您好！
    我叫宫本贞，莱西县河头店镇也洙泊村人。１９８８年２月６日，我和另一人用自行车带两箱鞭炮，准备到莱阳卖。路过城西于家店村北，被柏林庄派出所袁振军没收了，他让我交２００元钱就还我鞭炮，可是我没有钱。没收鞭炮后也没有什么扣留单和别的手续。后我托人说情才还给我一箱，另一大箱没有还给，他们准备自己用。我那箱大鞭有４万个头，价值４００元，这是我们一家老少的心血啊！难道上级有这样的规定吗？希望江局长给予答复和处理。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　农民
　宫本贞各科、所、队长同志：
    昨天我收到一封人民来信，反映柏林庄派出所有的干警扣压没收东西不打收条、不上交的问题。必须引起全局干警的严重注意。否则，我们就要损害公安机关和公安干警的形象，甚至犯错误或者跌到犯罪的泥坑里去，对干警从严要求，我认为这是真正的关心。
    当然，来信人私自生产、经售鞭炮是违法的。但我这里主要是强调扣压没收东西不能私自处理，更不允许没有手续就随便没收。
    请各科、所、队长同志将这个精神传达到全体干警，并认真检查一下在这方面还有些什么问题。因为我们现在到了大喊一声的时候了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　江守民
    经查，袁振军的确未给被没收人宫本贞以合法手续，对没收的鞭炮保管不妥，被当地的村干部拿走一部分，但别无其他违纪行为。
    局党组决定，开全局干警大会，宣读这“两封信”，并向全市公安系统通报批评；局纪检组和有关领导责成袁振军作出深刻书面检讨；被没收鞭炮的短缺部分，由袁振军包赔；将处理的结果面告宫本贞，并补发没收手续。
    事后，干警中个别人认为此事有些小题大作，处理过重。甚至有人在背后嘀咕：“江守民够歹毒的。”
    对此，江守民同志说：“歹毒”还有人敢这样干呢，不歹毒更忘了自己是干什么吃的了！
    自从江守民那次“歹毒”之后，全局干警至今无一违法违纪的；去年全市刑事案件破案率达８７％，其中重大案件破案率达９５％以上；袁振军呢，工作也有了明显进步。去年底，当市公安局又捧回了全市先进单位的大奖状时，连当初认为江守民“歹毒”的人也情不自禁地笑了起来……
