Afghan resistance forces' seven-party alliance chairman Ahmad Ghelani said in a press conference held in Islamabad on February 2 that the seven-party alliance is still in consultations with the eight-party alliance on the issue of establishing an Afghan consultative committee.

The consultative committee will be composed of representatives from various resistance parties, guerrilla commanders, refugees, intellectuals, and "upright Muslims" from the Kabul regime. The committee's responsibility will be to approve the interim government proposed by the seven-party alliance, so that after the Soviet Union withdraws from Afghanistan, the interim government can manage the country.

The consultative committee was originally scheduled to be formally established on February 1, but due to the eight-party alliance's demand for 120 seats, while the seven-party alliance only agreed to give it 60 seats, the committee could not be established as planned.

Ghelani said that the seven-party alliance leader Hekmatyar did not reach any agreement on this issue during his recent visit to Iran with the leaders of the eight-party alliance based in Iran. However, he expects that the consultative committee will hold a meeting in Pakistan on or around February 10.

　　阿抵抗力量继续磋商成立协商委员会问题
    新华社伊斯兰堡２月２日电  阿富汗抵抗力量７党联盟现任主席艾哈迈德·盖拉尼２日在伊斯兰堡举行的记者招待会上说，７党联盟就成立一个阿富汗协商委员会问题仍在同８党联盟磋商。
    协商委员会将由抵抗力量各党派、游击队指挥官、难民、知识分子和喀布尔政权中“正直的穆斯林”代表组成。委员会的职责是批准７党联盟提出的临时政府，以便在苏联从阿富汗撤军后，由临时政府来管理阿富汗。
    协商委员会原计划于２月１日正式成立，但由于８党联盟要求１２０个席位，而７党联盟只同意给它６０个席位，委员会未能如期成立。
    盖拉尼说，７党联盟领导人希克马蒂亚尔在最近访问伊朗期间同以伊朗为基地的８党联盟领导人就此问题未达成任何协议。但他预计，在２月１０日或此后的几天内，协商委员会将在巴基斯坦举行会议。
