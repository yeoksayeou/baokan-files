Once struggling, China's nuclear technology industry is now on the path to recovery. Officials from the Nuclear Industry Corporation stated that after several years of reform and adjustment, the development direction of the nuclear industry has become clear, and a layout focusing on nuclear technology and diversified operations is taking shape. Due to changes in the international situation, China has significantly reduced the production of military nuclear technology products, leading the nuclear industry to embark on a "second entrepreneurial journey," adjusting its product and production structures.

Officials mentioned that currently, China's nuclear industry is primarily engaged in the production of new energy equipment, such as nuclear power plants, and the development of energy-saving products. Additionally, leveraging the technological advantages of the nuclear industry, products related to fine chemicals are being developed.

In 1988, the construction of nuclear power plants progressed rapidly. Major technical challenges, such as the safety dome and pressure vessel of the Qin Shan Nuclear Power Plant, were completed on schedule. The main pipelines began welding, with excellent quality. The civil engineering of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong is in full swing, with the steel lining of the safety dome of the first reactor exceeding 22 meters.

The development of civilian products is also showing positive trends. Utilizing nuclear technology advantages, oil well logging technology and equipment for oil wells deeper than 3000 meters can enter mass production. The plasma spraying technology developed by the 585th Institute can make products appear golden or silvery, indistinguishable from the real thing. In 1988, the output value of such civilian products reached 500 million yuan, accounting for 33% of the total output value of the nuclear industry. Micro nuclear reactors and metallic calcium products have already entered the international market.

　　以生产新能源设备和研制节能产品为主
    我核技术工业形成新格局
    本报北京１月３１日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：曾经一度处于困难境地的我国核科技工业，正在从谷底走出来。核工业总公司有关人士说，经过几年改革和调整，核工业的开拓发展方向已经明朗，以核技术为主多种经营的格局正在形成。由于国际形势的变化，我国大量压缩核技术工业军用产品的生产，使核工业开始了“第二次创业”，进行产品结构和生产结构的调整。
    有关人士说，目前，我国的核工业格局主要是从事核电站等新能源生产设备和节能产品的研制。同时，发挥核工业的技术优势，研制精细化工等有关产品。
    １９８８年，核电站建设的进展较快。秦山核电站的安全壳穹顶和核岛压力容器等几项技术难度大的工作，已按期完成，主管道开始焊接，质量良好。广东大亚湾核电站的土建工程已进入高峰，一号反应堆安全壳钢衬里超过２２米。
    民用产品的开发出现好势头。利用核技术优势研制的石油测井技术、３０００米以下石油深井设备可以进入批量生产；５８５所开发的等离子喷涂技术，可使产品黄似金、白似银，以假乱真。１９８８年，这类民品产值达到５亿元，占核工业总产值的３３％。微型原子能反应堆、金属钙等产品已经进入国际市场。
