In recent years, various "wars" have frequently occurred in economic life, such as the wool war, the cotton war, and the cocoon silk war, resulting in mutual damage. People detest these wars, and relevant central departments have repeatedly ordered their cessation, but relevant production areas, enterprises, and units still get drawn into such vortexes. People ask: How did these wars come about? Will they happen again in the future? The answers are not easy. Our reporter attempts to use the cocoon silk war as an example, from the main battlefield to macro decision-making, to provide a review and reflection, allowing the broad readership to understand the situation and also providing a reference for the relevant departments and localities in improving their work.

The wounds from last year's "Silkworm Cocoon War" have not yet healed, and the spring cocoon procurement season will begin in a few days.

Will this year repeat past mistakes, or will a new order be established according to new policy thinking? This is a question of concern to everyone.

What are the underlying causes of these wars, which are often described as "everyone hates them, everyone curses them, but everyone engages in them"?

To find the answers, let us revisit the intense atmosphere and review the "battle" once more.

"The Main Battlefield" - A Glimpse

The most intense battle of the 1988 Silkworm Cocoon War took place at the end of August and the beginning of September during the early autumn cocoon procurement period. The main battlefield was located in the border area where Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces intersect.

In Jiangsu, the key player was Wuxiang County, known far and wide for its strong silk reeling and weaving capabilities. Its shape resembles a wedge, pointing directly at the heart of Zhejiang's key silkworm production area. Wuxiang produces about 100,000 piculs of silkworm cocoons annually, but it needs 200,000 piculs for reeling and 500,000 piculs for weaving, meaning its processing capacity far exceeds its cocoon resources.

Adjacent to it are Huzhou, Jiaxing, and Tongxiang in Zhejiang. These three areas produce 700,000 piculs of cocoons annually, and with the surrounding Deqing and Haining, the annual production exceeds 1 million piculs, accounting for 70% of the province's cocoon procurement. The cocoon resources and processing capabilities of these three areas are roughly balanced.

Wuxiang believed it was surrounded on three sides and should adopt a firm stance. Huzhou, Jiaxing, and Tongxiang, on the other hand, believed they should defend vigorously and fight fiercely.

In 1988, the determination of the provincial party and government leaders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to prevent the war from recurring was undoubted. As a Zhejiang agricultural official put it, they exhausted their brains, hearts, and all 18 kinds of martial arts.

There were repeated special meetings. Soft approaches included the provincial governor's persuasive education. Hard approaches included demotions, dismissals, newspaper naming, and high fines for administrative and economic rewards and punishments. Inter-provincial agreements were made to coordinate prices and not invade each other's territories. Within the province, cities, counties, and various levels implemented cocoon procurement responsibility systems. Silk companies and supply and marketing cooperatives almost entirely focused on cocoons. Commercial, tax, price, and transportation departments all joined the battle. Layer upon layer of defenses were set up, ready for battle, but a large-scale melee still erupted.

The cocoon news cycle is at most three to five days. Due to differences in silkworm varieties and climate, the maturation periods of Jiangsu and Zhejiang cocoons differ by about six to seven days. Both sides had agreed on the start date and procurement price, but on August 26, Wuxiang County, citing the early maturation of some Zhejiang silkworm varieties, started weighing and purchasing five days earlier, raising prices and snatching cocoons.

The cocoon procurement order in Zhejiang immediately fell into chaos. Farmers who were originally selling cocoons normally turned around, carrying, pulling, and shipping cocoons by land and water, surging towards Wuxiang, creating a scene of crowds. Meanwhile, Zhejiang's cocoon stations, which should have been bustling until early September, were deserted, with some even having no cocoons to collect.

There Were No Winners

Wuxiang County was severely criticized by the State Council and ordered to return 10,000 piculs of high-priced cocoons it had snatched. Zhejiang, which adopted a restrained attitude, did not raise prices in retaliation and maintained the unity of state orders, also suffered heavy losses.

Silk and cocoons are crucial export-earning products for Huzhou, Jiaxing, and Tongxiang. The loss of early autumn cocoons is estimated to be over 40,000 piculs, causing serious difficulties for the industrial production, foreign trade exports, and fiscal revenues of the three areas. It is estimated that the impact on output value is 30 million yuan, tax revenue is 2.8 million yuan, and foreign exchange earnings are reduced by 10 million US dollars.

In the rush to collect cocoons, quality was ignored, leading to a great waste of resources. Immature and hairy cocoons were quite common, with some cocoon stations reaching 90%. The unraveling rate and silk yield rate significantly decreased. There were also serious issues of adulteration and mixing. Cocoons were mixed with water, lime, glutinous rice flour, and sand. Some were even boiled, with one cocoon and a basket of water.

The constant prevention and battles disrupted the normal administrative and economic order, and the prestige of the Party and the government declined. In a year with five cocoon seasons, many departments and many leading cadres were involved. Someone described the scene during the war as "farmers selling cocoons running around, commercial cadres chasing around, township and village cadres busy running around, departments arguing with each other, and cocoons flowing around."

From a macro perspective, the harm of the cocoon war is not limited to this.

Firstly, the cocoon prices were driven up, increasing financial pressure. Just for the spring cocoon season, the state had to spend an additional 470 million yuan on cocoon purchases.

Secondly, the poor quality and high price of cocoons seriously affected export credibility. Experts lamented, "If this chaos continues, China's silk industry, which is at the forefront internationally, may be ruined in our hands."

Who Is Right and Who Is Wrong?

Looking back at the inter-provincial war during Zhejiang's early autumn cocoon season, not only did the State Council's red-headed documents fail, but even the governors' control was limited. The real players were the county and city-level "warlords."

Surprisingly, as the victim of the war, Zhejiang had quite a few people who understood Wuxiang County's actions: "The problem is not about who fired the first shot, nor is it about who subjectively wanted to fight, but rather the policies and mechanisms. Whoever is the county magistrate has to snatch!"

Those holding this view believe that the current fiscal policy of separate kitchens, foreign trade contract responsibility system, and the leadership term target responsibility system ultimately fall to the counties and cities as the specific implementation units. This creates a "block economy" and "feudal economy." The cocoon war escalated because, in addition to some regions using preferential policies for unfair competition, the essence is that each "block" uses price increases to compete for industrial raw materials. For the county and city leaders of the main cocoon-producing areas, losing the cocoons means everything else is meaningless.

Since the reform, through the central government's concessions and decentralization, the "vertical management" situation has been broken, and the highly centralized planned economy that has lasted for decades has been impacted. "Blocks" have gained vitality, and local economies have developed unprecedentedly. However, this decentralization has only replaced vertical management with horizontal management. With the increase in local autonomy and the diversification of interest subjects, in the absence of a well-established new order for commodity economy, it has brought about regional blockades, resource monopolies, repeated investments, and low efficiency. The cocoon war has sounded the alarm for us: under the condition of not wanting "vertical" management, how to stop "horizontal" management?

　　来自主战场的报告
    ——对“蚕茧大战”的回顾与反思
    本报记者  刘霄
    近年来，在经济生活中，常发生各类大战，例如羊毛大战，棉花大战，茧丝大战等，其结果是几败俱伤。人们讨厌这些大战，中央有关部门也三令五申加以制止，但有关产地区、有关企业、有关单位还是卷入了这样的旋涡。人们要问：这种大战是怎么产生的？今后还会不会再发生？回答并不容易。本报记者试以茧丝大战为例，从主战场到宏观决策，作一些回顾与反思，让广大读者了解实情，也供主管部门和地方在改进工作中参考。　　　　　　——编者　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    去年“蚕茧大战”造成的创伤尚未愈合，今年的春茧收购过些时日又将开始。
    今年是重蹈覆辙，还是按照新的政策思路建立起新的秩序？这是人们关切的问题。
    被人称为“人人恨，人人骂，人人干”的这类大战究竟诱因何在？
    为了寻找答案，还是让我们重新走进那白热化的氛围，进行一次“战例”回顾吧。
    　　　　“主战场”掠影
    １９８８年蚕茧大战最激烈的一役，发生在８月底９月初早秋茧收购期间，主战场就位于江浙两省犬齿交错的边界地带。
    交战的双方，在江苏，是以缫丝织绸能力强而远近闻名的吴江县。它的形状如同一只楔子，直指浙江蚕桑重点产区的心脏部位。吴江每年自产蚕茧１０余万担，然而缫丝要茧２０万担，织绸要茧５０万担，就是说加工能力远远超过蚕茧资源。
    与之毗邻的，是浙江的湖州、嘉兴和桐乡。三地每年产茧７０万担，加上外围的德清、海宁，每年产量百万担之多，占全省收茧量的７０％。三地的蚕茧资源和加工能力基本持平。
    吴江认为自己三面“受敌”，应采取强硬姿态。而湖嘉等地，则认为防要严防，战要猛战。
    １９８８年，江浙两省党政首脑防止战事重演的决心是无可怀疑的。用浙江农口一位干部的话说，可谓绞尽脑汁，呕尽心血，使尽了１８般武艺。
    一次又一次的专门会议。软的，有省长语重心长的说服教育。硬的，有罢官、降职，报纸点名，征收高额调节基金等行政经济奖惩条例。省际之间，订立了不止一份协调价格、互不侵犯的君子协议。省内，地市县各级落实收茧责任制。丝绸公司和供销社几乎全系统脱产管茧。工商、税务、物价、交通，一起上阵。层层设防，严阵以待，岂料还是爆发了一场大规模的混战。
    一期茧讯，最多三五天光景。由于蚕种、气候不同，江浙两省茧的成熟期前后约差六七天。两家本已商定开灶日期和收购价格，然而８月２６日，吴江县借口蚕农手中部分浙江茧种成熟，提前５天全面开秤，抬价抢购。
    浙江方面的收茧秩序顿时大乱。本来正常投售的蚕农掉过头，肩挑车载船运，水陆并进，涌向吴江，一时人山人海。而应持续旺灶到９月初的浙江茧站却门庭冷落，有些甚至颗茧无收。
    　　　　没有胜利者
    吴江县固然受到国务院严厉批评并被责令退回高价抢购的蚕茧１万担，而采取克制态度，没有抬价杀回马枪，维护了国家政令统一的浙江，也蒙受了惨重的损失。
    茧丝绸是湖嘉桐举足轻重的出口创汇产品。早秋茧流失估计在４万担以上，给三地的工业生产、外贸出口、财政税收带来了严重困难。据匡算，影响产值３０００万元，税收２８０万元，减少创汇１０００万美元。
    为了抢收蚕茧，不顾质量，造成资源的极大浪费。嫩茧、毛脚茧相当普遍，有些茧站甚至达到９０％，解舒率、出丝率大为下降。掺假施杂现象也很严重，茧里掺水、石灰、糯米粉、黄沙，有的干脆下锅浸煮，一颗茧子一兜水。
    不断的防范不断的大战打乱了正常的行政经济秩序，党和政府威信下降。一年五期茧，牵扯了许多部门、许多领导干部的精力。有人形容大战中的情景是“卖茧农民跑来跑去，工商干部追来追去，区乡干部忙来忙去，部门之间骂来骂去，茧子流来流去。”
    从宏观看，蚕茧大战的恶果还不仅止。
    首先，茧价你哄我抬，扶摇直上，高出原定收购价格１倍多，加大财政压力。仅春茧一季，国家就多支出茧款４．７亿元。
    其次，蚕茧质次价高，严重影响出口信誉。专家们痛心疾首：“再这么混战下去，在国际上独占鳌头的中国茧丝绸产业很可能要葬送在我们这一代手里。”
    　　　　孰是孰非
    反观浙江早秋茧期间的省际大战，不仅国务院的红头文件失灵，就是省长们的控制能力也是有限度的，真正起作用的是县市一级的“诸侯”。
    出乎意料的是作为大战受害一方的浙江，竟然有相当的人士对吴江县表示理解：“问题不在谁放第一枪，也不是哪一个主观想战，而是政策、机制使然，谁当县长谁得抢！”
    持这种观点的同志认为，现行的财政分灶吃饭政策、外贸包干政策以及领导任期目标责任制，最终以县市为具体落实单位，它造成的是“块块经济”“诸侯经济”。蚕茧大战之所以愈演愈烈，除某些地区凭借优惠政策进行不公平竞争外，其实质，是各个“块块”用抬价的方式，争夺工业原料。对蚕桑主产区的县、市长来说，失去了蚕茧，一切都无从谈起。
    改革以来，通过中央对地方的让利放权，“条条专政”的局面被打破，几十年高度集权的统制经济受到冲击，“块块”获得活力，地方经济获得空前发展。但是这种放权，只不过用块块式的统制经济取代了条条式的统制经济。随着地方自主权的加大和利益主体多元化而形成的，在商品经济新秩序没有很好建立的情况下，它带来的不是资源最佳配置、企业公平竞争、市场畅通无阻的商品经济，而是滋生了地区封锁、资源垄断、投资重复、效益低下。蚕茧大战为我们敲响了警钟：在不要“条条”统制的条件下，如何遏止“块块”统制？
