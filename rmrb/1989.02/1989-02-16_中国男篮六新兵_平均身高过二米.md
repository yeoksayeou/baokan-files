The China men's basketball team has six new players, all with an average height exceeding two meters.

Gong Xiaobin is 19 years old, 2.02 meters tall, and comes from the national youth team. He previously played as a defender and center for the Shandong football second team before switching to basketball. He is known for his speed, good jumping ability, and agile body, making him a key center player for the Shandong men's basketball team. His outstanding performance in the City Games earned him the titles of Best Rebounder and Best Basketball Player.

Ma Jian is 20 years old, 2 meters tall, and also from the national youth team. He has been selected for the national youth team twice. He is a versatile player with speed, agility, and excellent skills in breaking through for layups, grabbing rebounds, and finishing with alley-oops. His mid-range shots and defense are also outstanding. As a key player for the Hebei team, he contributed significantly to Hebei's achievements, including second place in last year's national league, third place in the "Basketball Association Cup," and third place in the "Top Eight Tournament."

Wang Li is 24 years old, 2.01 meters tall, and comes from the Liaoning team. This northeastern giant is known for his daring and fighting spirit, serving as a key center player for the Liaoning team. He excels in rebounding and has strong interior scoring ability, with accurate mid-range shots. Liaoning's recent success, including winning the national league championship, second place in the "Basketball Association Cup," and second place in the "Top Eight Tournament," is largely due to Wang Li's contributions.

Shan Tao is 19 years old, 2.12 meters tall, and comes from the national youth team. He is the tallest player in this men's basketball team and the youngest member. He has speed, high jumping ability, strong interior scoring, and excellent defensive control with a large coverage area. He is also skilled in blocking shots. However, he lacks competition experience and strength, which was evident during his time with the Beijing team.

Ou Yang Guijing is 20 years old, 2 meters tall, and comes from the national youth team. He is known for his agile body, quick reactions, high jumping ability, and excellent dunking skills. He is also proficient in rebounding. As the captain of the Guangdong men's basketball team, he has developed a high and agile style under the influence of the southern basketball culture. His youth and potential make him highly moldable.

Zhang Tao is 22 years old, 1.96 meters tall, and comes from the Nanjing Army team. He is known for his speed, bravery, and agility, excelling in breaking through for layups and blocking shots. Over the past two years, he has been a key player for the Nanjing Army team, showing outstanding performance on the court. In last year's "Basketball Association Cup" matches against Hebei and the Beijing Army team, he scored over 30 points in each game, playing a crucial role in the Nanjing Army team's victory.

　　中国男篮六新兵  平均身高过二米
    巩晓彬１９岁，２．０２米，来自国家青年队。他曾在山东足球二队踢过后卫和中锋，后操起篮球行当。他速度快，弹跳好，身体灵活，是山东男篮的主力中锋。他在城运会的出色表现，使他荣膺最佳篮板球奖和最佳篮球运动员称号。
    马健　２０岁，２米，来自国家青年队。他曾两度入选国家青年队。他是一个技术全面的选手，速度快，身体灵活，善长突破上篮、抢篮板球和空中补篮，中投和防守也出色。他作为河北队主力，为河北队获去年全国联赛第二、“篮协杯”第三和“八强赛”第三，立下赫赫战功。
    王力　２４岁，２．０１米，来自辽宁队。这位东北大汉，敢打敢拚，是辽宁队的主力中锋。他善抢篮板，内线进攻能力强，中投准。辽宁队近年成绩突出，去年获全国联赛冠军、“篮协杯”第二、“八强赛”第二，王力功不可没。
    单涛　１９岁，２．１２米，来自国家青年队。他是本届男篮的第一高度，也是全队最年轻的选手。他速度快，弹跳高，内线进攻能力强，防守控制面大，封盖好，是国内少见的身体条件出众的选手。但他比赛经验不足，力量也嫌不够，这在他效力北京队时已有表现。
    欧阳贵景　２０岁，２米，来自国家青年队。身体灵活，反应敏捷，弹跳高，扣篮好，善抢篮板球，属于这位中锋的特点。他是广东男篮主将，在南派风格的熏陶下，具备了高而灵活的条件，加之年轻，可塑性很大。
    张涛　２２岁，１．９６米，来自南京部队队。他速度快，勇猛灵活，擅长突破上篮和封堵盖帽。这两年，他作为南京部队队主力，敢打敢拚，场上表现不凡。去年“篮协杯”赛在对河北和北京部队队的比赛中，他每场都得３０多分，为南京部队队夺魁，立下汗马功劳。
