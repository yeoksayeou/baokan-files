The Great Prayer Festival in Tibet has seen various sects participating in religious activities and prayers for the Panchen Lama.

Tashilhunpo Monastery, Jampaling Monastery, and Choden Monastery have hosted over 30,000 monks and laypeople for their annual grand prayer gatherings over the past month and a half. In Shannan, Sangyey Monastery, in Gyantse, Pelkor Chode Monastery (a composite sect), Sakya Monastery (Kagyu sect), Namling's Drepung Monastery, Metok Monastery (Nyingma sect), and in Chamdo, Kundeling Monastery (Gelug sect) and other main monasteries have each held various forms of religious activities lasting from three days to half a month.

In Lhasa, although the major monasteries did not convene at the Jokhang Temple for the grand prayer gathering, they each arranged religious activities and prayers for the Panchen Lama from the eighth to the fifteenth day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar.

During this period, leaders from the Autonomous Region's Ethnic and Religious Affairs Commission visited the monks and nuns at Sera Monastery, Drepung Monastery, and Trashi Lhunpo Monastery. The Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China sent over 2,000 pounds of butter to various monasteries. The Autonomous Region's People's Government, in accordance with the previous year's standards for the Lhasa grand prayer gathering, distributed offerings to the monks and nuns of the monasteries holding the grand prayer gatherings.

　　西藏大神变节佛事形式多样
    有关部门按惯例向寺庙僧尼发放布施
    新华社拉萨２月２４日电  （通讯员周敦友、记者皮德义）西藏大神变节期间许多教派参加了佛事活动和为班禅大师的祈祷活动。
    扎什伦布寺、强巴林寺、孝登寺近半个多月来，共有３万多名僧俗群众参加了本寺一年一度的大法会。山南的桑鸢寺、江孜的白居寺（综合教派）、萨迦寺（花教）、南木林的热拉拥宗、墨如寺（笨布教）和昌都的类鸟齐寺（白教）等祖寺及主寺，分别用三天至半个月的时间，举行多种形式的佛事活动。拉萨的各大寺庙，虽然未在大昭寺集中举行传召大法会，但是都从藏历元月初八至十五日在本寺安排了大神变节期间的佛事活动和为班禅大师的祈祷活动。
    这期间，自治区民族宗教事务委员会的领导同志，到哲蚌寺、色拉寺、热堆寺等寺庙看望了广大僧尼；中国佛教协会西藏分会给各寺庙送去２０００多斤酥油；自治区人民政府按照往年拉萨传召大法会的布施标准，给举行大法会的寺庙僧尼发给布施。
