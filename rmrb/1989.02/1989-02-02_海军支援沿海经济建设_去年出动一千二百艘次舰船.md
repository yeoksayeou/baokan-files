The navy dispatched 1,200 ship trips in 1988 to complete 414 key projects in coastal regions, becoming a marine rapid-response team for supporting coastal economic construction.

Navy ship units leveraged their advantages in water-based construction and marine transportation. They actively participated in the investigation of continental shelf resources, coastal surveys, harbor and channel dredging, port and wharf construction, reservoir and dam construction, underwater cable laying, large-scale material marine transportation, and water-based and underwater construction for various large-scale projects such as bridges and power plants. A certain engineering unit of the South Sea Fleet successively undertook projects like the Maoming Water East Port Wharf, the Zhanjiang Xiahai Foreign Trade Container Wharf, the Zhuhai Wanzi Water Supply to Macau, and the Guishan Island Wharf Breakwater. Navy units participating in the construction of the second phase of the Shanghai Baosteel project, the Huangpu River Tunnel, and the Fujian thermal power plant completed their engineering tasks with high quality and speed despite the high technical requirements and difficulties. Navy personnel from the North Sea Fleet participating in the construction of the Yellow River Estuary Wharf project in the Shengli Oilfield have completed nearly one million cubic meters of port soil and stone work, built a 1,840-meter-long guide pier, and two temporary wharves made of steel pipe piles.

Since mid-November last year, the navy dispatched ship units to help Zhejiang Province transport 40,000 tons of relief grain, receiving praise from relevant leaders of the State Council.

　　海军支援沿海经济建设
    去年出动一千二百艘次舰船
    新华社北京２月１日电  （记者黄彩虹）海军１９８８年出动舰船１２００余艘次，完成沿海地区重点工程４１４项，成为支援沿海经济建设的海上突击队。
    海军各舰艇部队发挥水上施工和海上运输的优势，积极参加沿海地区大陆架资源的调查，岸线测量，港区、航道扫测，港口、码头建设，水库、大坝施工，海底电缆铺设，大型物资海上运输，以及桥梁、电站等各种大型工程的水上水下施工。南海舰队某工程部队先后承担了广东茂名水东港码头、湛江霞海外贸集装箱码头、珠海湾仔对澳门供水、桂山岛码头防波堤等工程。参加上海宝钢二期工程、黄浦江隧道和福建火力发电厂工程建设的海军部队，在施工难度大、技术要求高的情况下，高质量、高速度地完成了工程任务。参加胜利油田黄河口码头工程施工的北海舰队官兵，目前已完成建港土石方近百万立方米，建成１８４０米的引堤和两座钢管桩临时码头。
    去年１１月中旬以来，海军派出舰艇部队帮助浙江省抢运救灾粮４万余吨，受到国务院有关领导的好评。
