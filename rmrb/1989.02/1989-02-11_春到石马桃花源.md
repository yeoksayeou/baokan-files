Spring has arrived at the Peach Blossom Spring of Shima. The two lines of poetry describe the new town of Shima in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou. Not long ago, more than 60 poets, calligraphers, and painters, including Qin Mu and Guan Shan Yue, gathered here for an annual literary and artistic gathering amidst the blooming peach blossoms.

Standing at the village entrance, one can see peach trees in full bloom, their flowers covering the branches, shining like a bright red sunset.

The literary and artistic celebrities who gathered at the Peach Blossom Spring of Shima are mostly over sixty years old. Although it was a chilly day after a recent rain, they were still in high spirits, walking through the muddy paths and fields, entering the peach groves, and admiring the peach blossoms.

"The long history of peach cultivation in Shima is unclear to anyone," said the village head, Huang Beihe. He recounted a beautiful legend: It is said that in ancient times, a Taoist from Mount Wutai in Shanxi traveled south and came to Shima Village. He ate peaches and drank fine wine, and then spat out more than ten white peach pits, which he bestowed upon the villagers. The villagers treasured them as precious gems, planting them in the ground, and thus the peach trees have been passed down through generations. The fields of Shima Village have since become a Peach Blossom Spring.

Planting peach blossoms during the Spring Festival is a local custom in Guangzhou, symbolizing the replacement of old with new. Therefore, every year during the Guangzhou Lantern Festival, peach blossoms are the most popular. The peach blossoms in Shima are harvested just before the Spring Festival, accounting for 60% of Guangzhou's total peach blossom supply, with a significant portion also exported.

Today, Shima Village has over 3,300 acres of land planted with more than 90,000 peach trees, creating a picturesque scene. Beneath the peach groves, the vegetable fields are lush and green, providing a continuous supply of seasonal vegetables. This is another scenic spot in Shima Village.

The lives of the people in the Peach Blossom Spring have been improving year by year. Last year, the village's total income exceeded 18 million yuan, with agricultural income alone reaching over 12 million yuan, of which 20% came from peach blossoms. The village's population of over 5,000 people has an average annual income exceeding 2,000 yuan. The former mud houses have been transformed into small villas. Chen Can Yun, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Writers Association and a famous writer, who once tilled the fields and planted peach blossoms in the village, revisited his hometown this day and wrote a poem: "Year after year, the peach blossoms bloom, keeping the hometown's affection; the hometown adds new colors, celebrating the revival with white wine."

As they left the peach groves, it was already lunchtime. The poets, calligraphers, and painters, still full of enthusiasm, entered a small villa hidden among the peach blossoms in the village. Some left their calligraphy, while others painted, all saying that this trip was not in vain.

　　春到石马桃花源
    本报记者  梁兆明
    “桃源今日数石马，花如繁星灿若霞”。这两句诗，写的是广州北郊的新市镇石马村。前不久，秦牧、关山月等６０多位诗书画家一起来到这桃花初开的地方，参加一年一度的文艺雅集。
    站在村头，只见满目桃林，树花满枝，灿若明霞。
    共聚石马桃花源的文艺界名流，大都年过花甲。这天虽然冷雨刚过，还是兴致勃勃地踩着泥泞，走田埂，入桃林，赏桃花。
    “石马种桃花的悠久历史，谁也说不清了。”村长黄北和讲了一段美丽的传说：相传在古时候，山西五台山有位仙人南游，来到石马村吃仙桃饮美酒，把吐出来的１０多个白色桃核赐给了村民。村民如获至宝，栽种地上，从此世代繁殖。石马村田野遂成桃花源。
    春节插桃花是五羊城的民间习俗，取“新桃换旧符”之意。所以，岁岁羊城除夕花市，又以桃花最抢手。石马桃花集中在春节前上市，占广州桃花总供应量的６成，还有大量供应市外和出口。
    今日石马村，３３００多亩土地，种下桃树９万多株，美景如画。桃林之下，菜田青青，四时瓜菜上市不绝。这是石马村的又一景。
    桃花源中人的日子一年比一年好。去年，全村总收入１８００多万元，其中农业总收入１２００多万元，桃花的收入占农业总收入的２成。全村５０００多人口，人均收入超过２０００元。昔日泥屋茅舍农家，如今变成小楼别院。祖居石马村的广东省作协主席、著名作家陈残云，少时在村中耕过田种过桃花。这天，他故园重游，有感作诗一首：“岁岁桃花会，长留故乡情；家乡添异彩，白酒庆中兴。”
    步出桃林，已是午饭时候。诗书画家们余兴未尽，进入村中桃花掩映的一座小楼别院，有的挥毫留墨宝，有的泼墨绘丹青，都说这才不枉此游。
