The Twelve Zodiac Animals (Hubei Paper Cutting)

The twelve zodiac animals are a significant part of Chinese culture, each representing a year in a twelve-year cycle. This particular artwork is a beautiful example of Hubei paper cutting, a traditional Chinese folk art. The intricate designs and vivid colors capture the essence of each animal, from the rat to the pig, showcasing the craftsmanship and artistic talent of the Hubei region. This art form not only reflects the rich cultural heritage but also serves as a reminder of the deep-rooted traditions that continue to thrive in modern China.
