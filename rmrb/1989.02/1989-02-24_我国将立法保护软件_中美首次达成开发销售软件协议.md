China has once again stated that it will take various measures, including legislation, to protect intellectual property rights.

The Sixth Research Institute of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics and the American company Ansys Inc. signed an agreement yesterday to jointly develop and market the Chinese version of Ansys Inc.'s Dbase-4 database software.

An official from the Computer Department of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics told a reporter: "This is the first time that a foreign company has cooperated with a Chinese company in the development and marketing of database software. It shows the Chinese government's determination to promote the healthy development of the software industry and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties involved in software products."

Because computer software is difficult to develop but easy to copy, the development of China's software industry has been hindered in the absence of corresponding intellectual property protection laws, and the interests of some foreign software industries have also been affected.

It is reported that the National Law Office has authorized the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics and relevant departments of the State Council to jointly draft the Computer Software Protection Law. Soon, software management regulations will be issued first.

　　我国将立法保护软件
    中美首次达成开发销售软件协议
    本报北京２月２３日讯  记者猛子报道：中国再次表明，它将采取种种措施，包括通过立法，来保护知识产权。
    机械电子工业部第六研究所与美国安信达公司昨日就合作开发与经销安信达公司迪贝斯—４等数据库软件的中文版达成协议。
    机械电子工业部计算机司一位官员对记者说：“这是中外首次数据库软件开发和经销合作。它表达了我国政府促使软件产业健康发展，维护软件产品中外各方合法权益的决心。”
    由于计算机软件有着难以开发而又极易复制的特点，在没有相应的知识产权保护法的情况下，我国的软件产业发展困难，国外软件行业的一些利益也受到影响。
    据透露：国家法制局已授权机械电子工业部及国务院有关部委共同草拟计算机软件保护法。不久，将先期产生软件管理规定。
