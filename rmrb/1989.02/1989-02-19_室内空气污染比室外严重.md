Indoor air pollution is more severe than outdoor pollution. According to investigations, the harmful chemicals in indoor air are 100 times more concentrated than outdoors. Moreover, the air pollution is most severe in the first six months after a building is completed.

The investigation found that buildings contain carcinogenic substances such as trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, and P-dichlorobenzene. These harmful chemicals are released from carpet glue, linoleum, ethylene, rubber decorative strips, telephone wires, and particleboard walls. Many people experience symptoms such as headaches, nasal irritation, fatigue, and nausea after moving into new buildings.

Therefore, it is important to pay attention to ventilation frequently after moving into a new building.

　　室内空气污染比室外严重
    据调查，室内空气中所含的有害化学物质比室外多１００倍，而且在建筑物建成后最初６个月空气污染最严重。
    在调查中发现，建筑物内含有能使人致癌的三氯甲烷、四氯化碳以及Ｐ——二氯苯。有害化学物质是从地毯胶、油毡、乙烯、橡胶装饰线条、电话线和颗粒隔墙中散发出来的。许多人住进去后就有头疼、鼻子受刺激、疲倦、恶心等病症。
    因此，搬进新建筑物后要经常注意通风。
