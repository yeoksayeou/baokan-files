Farmers in Fuzhou Build Over a Thousand Parks

Farmers in the suburban areas of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, have built 1,024 parks of various sizes. These parks were constructed over the past decade with an investment of over 40 million yuan. The parks, which are either nestled among mountains, situated by water, or located within banyan tree groves, each have their unique characteristics and are scattered throughout the entire suburban countryside. Some villages even have more than two parks.

Most of the rural parks do not charge entrance fees, and the management costs are mainly covered by the local village finances. The farmers take great care of the parks they have built, and there are rarely instances of stolen plants or damaged scenery.

　　福州农民兴建千座公园
    本报讯  福建省福州市郊区农民拥有一千零二十四座大小不一的公园。这是他们在近十年内投资四千多万元建成的。这些公园，或依山，或傍水，或在榕树丛中，各具特色，遍布整个郊区乡村，有的村还有两个以上。
    乡间公园大多不卖门票，公园管理费多由乡村财政支出。农民对自己办的公园十分爱惜，很少出现丢失花木或破坏景观的现象。
