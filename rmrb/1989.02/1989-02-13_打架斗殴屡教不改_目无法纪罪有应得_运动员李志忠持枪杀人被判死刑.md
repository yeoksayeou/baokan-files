Repeatedly Fighting and Disregarding the Law, Deserving of Punishment: Athlete Li Zhizhong Sentenced to Death for Shooting and Killing

    The People's Daily, Fuzhou, February 11 - Reporter Zhang Mingqing reports: Li Zhizhong, an athlete from the Fujian Provincial Sports Team, was convicted of murder and robbery. Today, the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court handed down a first-instance verdict sentencing him to death and depriving him of political rights for life.

    On the afternoon of January 29, around 5 PM, Li and Shang Weidong, each carrying a short knife and a shortened small-caliber rifle, broke into the room of the victim Wu Ping (a self-funded student in Japan) at the Fuzhou Hot Spring Hotel. During a conversation, Shang and Wu had an argument, and Shang shot Wu in the head, causing Wu to suffer brain damage and bleed to death on the spot. Shang then shot at Sun (female) and Yang (female) who were present, and Li Zhizhong stabbed Sun and Yang with a knife, killing both of them on the spot. After killing the three, Shang and Li looted money and valuables worth over 4,500 yuan. As Shang and Li attempted to flee the scene, they encountered Yang, Li (female), Chen, and Lin (female) who came to look for Wu Ping. To cover their tracks, Shang Weidong shot and killed Yang and Li, injuring Chen and Lin. Li Zhizhong stabbed Chen in the abdomen, causing her severe injuries. After the crime, Shang and Li returned to the athlete's dormitory of the provincial sports team. On the morning of January 30, Li Zhizhong was captured in the insulation layer on the roof of the dormitory building, while Shang Weidong was shot and killed while resisting arrest.

    It is understood that Li and Shang had been investigated by the public security authorities last September for fighting and were placed on probation by the provincial sports team for six months. The two committed the crime during this probation period. They habitually disregarded laws and regulations, had a lax attitude, and were even hired by others to participate in fights.

    After the first-instance verdict, Li Zhizhong appealed, requesting an appeal.

　　打架斗殴屡教不改　目无法纪罪有应得    
    运动员李志忠持枪杀人被判死刑
    本报福州２月１１日电  记者张铭清报道：犯有杀人抢劫罪的福建省体工队田径运动员李志忠，今天由福州市中级人民法院作出判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身的一审判决。
    １月２９日下午５时许，李、商卫东分别携带短刀和锯短了的小口径步枪，窜入被害人吴平（自费留日学生）租住的福州温泉大厦客房。商与吴在谈话时发生争执，便向吴头部射击，致吴脑损伤出血当场死亡。接着商又向在场的孙某（女）、杨某各开一枪，李志忠持刀朝孙、杨二人猛刺，致二人当场死亡。商、李杀死三人后，即行抢劫钱物，总值达人民币４５００多元。当商、李二人欲逃离现场时，恰遇杨某、李某（女）、陈某、林某（女）四人来找吴平。为了灭口，商卫东开枪打死杨、李，打伤陈、林，李志忠用刀猛刺陈的腹部，致陈重伤。作案后，商、李二人逃回省体工队运动员宿舍。１月３０日凌晨，李志忠在宿舍楼顶隔热层内被抓获归案，商卫东拒捕被当场击毙。
    据悉，李、商二犯曾于去年９月因打架斗殴被公安机关审查过，被省体工队留用察看半年。二犯是在留用察看期间作案的。二犯平时无视法纪，作风散漫，还受雇于人参与打架斗殴。
    一审判决后，李志忠对判决不服，要求上诉。
