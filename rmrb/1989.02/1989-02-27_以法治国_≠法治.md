The phrase "rule by law" was mentioned by the pre-Qin legalist Guan Zhong, and Han Fei also discussed it. Their proposal was a response to the Confucian idea of "rule by virtue," and in that era, it had historical progressive significance. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, in response to the long-term prevalence of legal nihilism, the legal community vigorously promoted the idea of "rule by law," which also played a positive role. Even now, the concept of "rule by law" has aspects worth learning from.

However, we must also recognize that "rule by law" and "rule of law" are not interchangeable terms. The fundamental characteristic of the rule of law is the supremacy of law. Any individual, when compared to the law, the law possesses higher authority. A society under the rule of law is definitely a democratic society where the law is above all individuals. On the other hand, "rule by law" does not possess these characteristics or implications.

The "law" in "rule of law" and the "law" in "rule by law" represent different wills. The "law" in "rule of law" represents the will of the people. Although the composition of "the people" varies in different countries and different historical periods of the same country, and the scope is also different, it ultimately represents the collective will of a nation in different historical periods, rather than the will of any individual. It is enacted by the legislative body, not decreed by emperors, kings, or monarchs. The "law" in "rule by law," however, represents the will of the monarch or king. Guan Zhong's statement, "the creator of laws is the ruler," clearly illustrates this point. In the idealized "rule by law" society of Guan Zhong and Han Fei, the monarch or king can change the laws at will, both enacting and abolishing laws with a single word.

The subjects of "rule of law" and "rule by law" are also different. The subject of the rule of law is the people. The people, through the legislative body, enact laws and authorize administrative and judicial organs through the law. The subject of "rule by law," however, is the monarch or king, who uses the law to govern the country. Legalists advocate for extreme monarchical autocracy. In their view, the law is merely a "tool of the emperor," and the monarch or king can completely disregard the law's provisions, rewarding and punishing arbitrarily according to their moods and desires (as stated in the "Han Shu · Chao Cuo Zhuan").

To implement the rule of law, of course, one must use the law to govern the country; but advocating for the use of the law as a method of governance does not necessarily mean advocating for the rule of law. Pre-Qin Confucians emphasized virtue over law, and post-Han Confucians advocated for "virtue as the mainstay and punishment as a supplement," although they were all advocates of personal rule, they did not completely deny the role of law. Legalists, although they emphasized the special importance of law in governing the country and advocated for "rule by law," this advocacy is not the same as advocating for the rule of law. As Rousseau said: "A tyrant is someone who intervenes in the government against the law but rules according to the law; a despot is someone who places himself above the law itself." ("The Social Contract," page 116) From this, it can be seen that "someone who rules according to the law" can also be a tyrant who intervenes in the government against the law, or a despot who places himself above the law itself. The "rule by law" advocated by the legalists is exactly this.

The rule of law is contradictory to personal despotism, while "rule by law" is compatible with personal despotism. We should use the concept of implementing socialist rule of law, use the terms "rule by law" and "administration by law," to replace "rule by law." The difference between "rule by law" and "rule by law" is significant, and we must not use "rule by law" to replace "rule by law."

### “以法治国”≠法治

　　“以法治国”≠法治
     王礼明
    “以法治国”这句话，先秦法家管仲说过，韩非也说过，他们的这个主张，是针对儒家的“德治”提出来的，在当时的那个时代，是有历史进步意义的。党的十一届三中全会以后，针对长期泛滥的法律虚无主义，法学界大力宣传“以法治国”，也曾起过积极作用。就是在现在，“以法治国”的提法，也仍然有值得我们借鉴的地方。
    但是，我们也要认识到：“以法治国”与“法治”之间，既不能划等号，也不能相混淆。法治的基本特征是法律至上。任何个人与法律相比，法律都具有更高的权威。法治社会，一定是一个民主的社会，法律面前人人平等的社会。而“以法治国”，则不具有上述特征或涵义。
    “法治”的“法”与“以法治国”的“法”，体现的意志是不同的。“法治”的“法”，体现的是人民的意志。尽管这里的“人民”，在不同的国家以及同一国家的不同历史时期，构成不同，范围大小也不一样，但它体现的，毕竟是一个国家的不同历史时期的群体意志，而不是哪一个个人的意志。它是由立法机关通过的，而不是由国君、国王、皇帝钦定的。而“以法治国”的“法”，体现的则是国君或国王的意志，管仲所说的“生法者君也”，就很能说明这一点。在被管仲和韩非理想化了的“以法治国”的社会里，国君或国王是可以随心所欲“变其令”，既可以一言兴法，也可以一言废法的。
    “法治”的主体与“以法治国”的主体，也是不同的。法治的主体是人民。由人民通过立法机关制定法律，通过法律授权给行政机关和司法机关。而“以法治国”的主体，则是国君或国王，由国君或国王运用法律去治理国家。法家是主张极端君主专制的。在法家看来，法律不过是“帝王之具”，国君或国王完全可以不管法律的规定，“妄赏以随喜意，妄诛以快怒心”的（《汉书·晁错传》）。
    实行法治，当然要运用法律来治理国家；但主张把法律作为一种治国方法的，并不一定就是主张法治的。先秦儒家重德轻法，汉代以后的儒家主张“德主刑辅”，虽然都是主张人治的，但也没有完全否定法的作用。法家虽然强调法律在治理国家中有特别重要的作用，主张“以法治国”，但这种主张也不是法治主张。正如卢梭所说的那样：“暴君是一个违背法律干预政权而依照法律实行统治的人；专制主则是一个把自己置于法律本身之上的人。”（《社会契约论》第１１６页）由此可知，“一个依照法律实行统治的人”，也可以是一个“违背法律干预政权”的暴君，或者是一个“把自己置于法律本身之上的”专制主。法家主张的“以法治国”，正是如此。
    法治与个人专断是矛盾的，“以法治国”与个人专断是相通的。我们应当用实行社会主义法治的提法，用“依法治国”、“依法行政”的提法，代替“以法治国”。“以”“依”不同，切不可以“以”代“依”。
