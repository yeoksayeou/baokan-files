Shandong Issues Greenification Reward and Punishment Measures

Jinan, February 24 (Xinhua) — To uphold the seriousness of the greenification targets agreed upon by the provincial governor and municipal mayors and prefectural chiefs, the Shandong Provincial Government recently issued reward and punishment measures.

The measures stipulate that for cities and prefectures that fully complete the five-year afforestation and greenification targets as specified in the responsibility system on time, a certificate of qualification will be awarded, and they will be commended in a public announcement. For those that complete the targets one year ahead of schedule, a greenification reward of 200,000 yuan will be granted, and the main responsible persons will each be credited with one meritorious deed.

For those whose responsibility statements are not completed by the deadline, the main responsible persons will be criticized in a public announcement.
