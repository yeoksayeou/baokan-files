The second National Youth Games, to be held in September in Shenyang, will no longer feature a large-scale gymnastics display. This was announced by Zhu Jiaxuan, deputy director of the Youth Games Organizing Committee and vice governor of Liaoning Province, at the conclusion of the second Youth Games conference for mayors of host cities and some department heads yesterday.

For many years, large-scale gymnastics displays have been a traditional part of the opening ceremonies of major sports events. Although these displays are impressive and inspiring, they are also costly. Moreover, they require thousands of schoolchildren to practice intensively for several months before the games, which disrupts their normal studies. The organizing committee of the second National Youth Games has decided to replace the gymnastics display with a high-level football exhibition match, which will save more than 1.5 million yuan.

Zhu Jiaxuan also mentioned that, with the approval of the State Sports Commission, the championship trophies for individual events at this competition will be allowed to bear the names of enterprises.

　　第二届青运会开幕式改革传统作法
    不搞大型团体操　节约一百五十万
    新华社沈阳２月２１日电  （记者王健民）今年９月在沈阳举行的全国第二届青少年运动会，将不再搞大型团体操表演。这是青运会筹委会副主任、辽宁省副省长朱家甄在昨天结束的第二届青运会赛区市长、部分厅局长会议上宣布的。
    多年来，团体操表演一直是大型运动会开幕式的传统项目。大型团体操虽然气势宏大、鼓舞人心，但耗资较大，而且在赛前几个月就要集中几千名中小学生进行操练，使他们的正常学习受到影响。第二届青运会筹委会决定，开幕式将由一场较高水平的足球表演赛取代团体操表演，这项改革可节约１５０多万元的经费。
    朱家甄还说，征得国家体委同意，这次赛会的单项冠军杯，允许以企业的名称命名。
