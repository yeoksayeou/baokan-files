Notable participants include American track and field stars Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner, Soviet pole vault champion Sergey Bubka, and China's outstanding divers, including Xu Yanmei and Gao Min.

The Goodwill Games, held every four years since its inception in 1986, features 21 competition events, with each event limited to 8 participants (or teams). Participants are selected based on their performances and rankings in the Olympic Games and other major international competitions. The 1990 Games, scheduled to take place from July 20 to August 5 in Seattle, USA, will see the participation of approximately 2,500 athletes from over 50 countries and regions. The largest delegations are expected to come from the Soviet Union (174 athletes), the United States (149 athletes), and East Germany (134 athletes). Other significant delegations include West Germany (67 athletes), the United Kingdom (51 athletes), Bulgaria (48 athletes), China (47 athletes), and Canada (46 athletes).

It is understood that the final list of participants will be confirmed later this year, and the Seattle organizing committee will extend invitations to them. Invitees are required to respond by January of next year.
