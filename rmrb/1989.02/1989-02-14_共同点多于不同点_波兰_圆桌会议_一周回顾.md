Representatives from various parties and social forces in Poland have participated in the "Round Table Conference" for a week. In the plenary sessions, the representatives have articulated their respective positions on major domestic issues. They have also expressed their views in three subcommittee meetings on economic and social policies, the pluralization of trade unions, and political reforms.

From the perspective of a week's worth of conference proceedings, the reporter's initial impression is that the commonalities in the participants' positions on various issues outweigh the differences. Although the government and Solidarity Trade Union have significant disagreements on some key issues, it is also evident that the participants in the "Round Table Conference" have converging or similar views on many issues. Therefore, the possibility of the participants resolving differences through dialogue and negotiation and ultimately reaching national reconciliation exists.

Firstly, the commonalities are reflected in the willingness of both the government and Solidarity Trade Union, after eight years of conflict and confrontation, to move towards reconciliation. Interior Minister Kiszczak welcomes the constructive opposition to participate in the dialogue and discuss state affairs. Former Solidarity Trade Union leader Lech Wałęsa believes that "Poland needs stability" and is willing to sit down for negotiations.

Secondly, the commonalities are reflected in the participants' positive attitude towards the government's economic restructuring plan. Although the representatives have proposed some modifications and reservations, they generally believe that the plan is beneficial for improving market supply and curbing inflation. Government spokesman Urban predicts that the "prospects for reaching a consensus on economic issues are extremely optimistic."

Thirdly, the participants have similar views on the direction and methods of political reform. Kiszczak emphasizes that political reform should follow the direction of socialist democratization and adopt a gradual approach. He believes that dragging one's feet or being impulsive "can only hinder reform and make it more complicated." Solidarity Trade Union advisor Grzegorz Geremek also believes that political reform must lead to the establishment of a democratic system, and that political reform is a gradual process.

Fourthly, the representatives all support the pluralization of trade unions and unanimously believe that allowing more new trade unions, including Solidarity Trade Union, to exist legally and compete with each other is in line with Poland's future reality. Therefore, the legalization of Solidarity Trade Union is no longer a problem in principle, but the path to legalization is still under discussion.

Fifthly, on the issue of parliamentary reform, the participants seem to have more common ground. The proposal by the Central Committee member of the Polish United Workers' Party, Ryszard Rewkowski, to establish a presidential system and expand parliamentary representation has received general approval from the representatives.

In the subcommittee meetings, there are also many disagreements. The legalization of Solidarity Trade Union is the most contentious issue. Government representatives insist that Solidarity Trade Union should be "re-established" according to the trade union charter, in compliance with the constitution, and without disrupting social stability. However, the representatives of Solidarity Trade Union demand that the government "restore the legality of Solidarity Trade Union." The focus of the disagreement is the interpretation of the martial law in 1981 (Solidarity Trade Union was banned during the martial law). The government affirms the martial law, while Solidarity Trade Union holds the opposite view.

Additionally, on the issue of the scope of trade union activities, Solidarity Trade Union and the Polish Trade Union Council have differing opinions. The former advocates that "a factory can have several trade unions," while the latter emphasizes that "a factory can only have one trade union."

The representatives have divergent views on the issue of parliamentary elections, especially on the allocation of seats and the election date. Most representatives support the three allied parties—Polish United Workers' Party, United Peasants' Party, and Democratic Party—occupying 60% of the seats in the next parliament, but Solidarity Trade Union proposes that the three allied parties can only occupy 40% to 50% of the seats. As for the motion to hold parliamentary elections ahead of schedule, the United Peasants' Party and the Christian Social Union have expressed opposition.

Polish Prime Minister Rakowski recently expressed an optimistic attitude towards the prospects of the "Round Table Conference." Wałęsa also expressed the same view in an interview yesterday. He said that he is "more confident than ever" in the successful conclusion of the "Round Table Conference."

On February 13, the subcommittee meetings of the "Round Table Conference" began substantive discussions on specific issues. This is a critical stage for the "Round Table Conference" because it will determine whether the second plenary session of the "Round Table Conference" in mid-March can announce "good news" to the Polish people.

### 共同点多于不同点——波兰“圆桌会议”一周回顾

　　共同点多于不同点
    ——波兰“圆桌会议”一周回顾
    新华社记者  汤德乔
    波兰各党派和社会力量代表参加的“圆桌会议”已进行一周。代表们在全体会议上就国内重大问题阐明了各自立场，也在经济和社会政策问题、工会多元化问题、政治改革问题３个小组会议上发表了看法。
    综观一周的会议情况，记者的初步印象是：与会者对各种问题所持立场的共同点多于不同点。尽管当局与团结工会在一些关键问题上分歧严重，但参加“圆桌会议”的各方在不少问题上观点相吻合或接近也是明显的。因此，与会各方通过对话协商消除分歧，进而达成民族谅解的可能性是存在的。
    首先，共同点表现在经历了８年冲突、对抗的当局和团结工会双方愿意走向和解。内务部长基什查克欢迎建设性反对派参加对话，共商国是。前团结工会主席瓦文萨认为“波兰需要安定”，并愿意坐下来谈判。
    其次，共同点表现在与会者对政府制定的经济整顿计划持肯定的态度。尽管代表们提出一些修改和保留意见，但普遍认为，计划有利于改善市场供应、制止通货膨胀。政府发言人乌尔班预测，各方对经济问题取得一致观点的“前景极为乐观”。
    第三，与会者在政治改革的方向和方法上观点相同。基什查克强调，政治改革应遵循社会主义民主化方向，采取循序渐进的方法。他认为，拖泥带水或头脑发热“只能阻碍改革并使改革复杂化”。团结工会顾问葛莱梅克也认为，政治改革必须导致民主制度的建立，政治改革是一个渐变的过程。
    第四，代表们都赞成工会多元化，并一致认为，允许包括团结工会在内的更多新工会合法存在，促使它们相互竞争，符合波兰今后的客观实际。因此，团结工会合法化在原则上已不成问题，只是在合法化途径上尚待商榷。
    第五，在议会改革问题上，与会者似乎有更多的共同语言。波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员雷伊科夫斯基提出的关于设立总统制、扩大议会代表性等建议受到代表们的普遍赞同。
    在小组会上，代表们的分歧也不少。团结工会如何合法化问题是争议最大的问题。当局代表坚持团结工会按照工会章程、在遵守宪法、不破坏社会安定等条件下“重新成立”，而团结工会代表则要求当局“恢复团结工会合法性”。双方分歧的焦点是如何看待１９８１年的军管（团结工会是在军管期间被取缔的）。当局肯定军管，而团结工会则持相反的态度。
    此外，在工会活动范围方面，团结工会与波兰工会协议会意见不一。前者主张，“一个工厂可以有几个工会”；而后者却强调，“一个工厂只能有一个工会”。
    各方代表对议会选举问题，尤其是议席分配和选举日期问题意见纷纭。多数代表赞成统一工人党、统一农民党和民主党３个盟党占下届议会６０％席位，但团结工会则提出３个盟党只能占４０％至５０％席位。至于对提前举行议会选举的动议，统一农民党和基督教社会联盟表示反对。
    波兰政府总理拉科夫斯基最近在谈到“圆桌会议”的前景时表示了乐观的态度。瓦文萨昨天在接受记者采访时也发表了同样的看法。他说，他对“圆桌会议”的圆满成功“比过去更充满信心”。
    ２月１３日，“圆桌会议”各小组会议开始对具体问题进行实质性讨论。这是“圆桌会议”的关键性阶段，因为它将决定３月中旬举行的“圆桌会议”第２次全体会议能否向波兰人民宣布“好消息”。
