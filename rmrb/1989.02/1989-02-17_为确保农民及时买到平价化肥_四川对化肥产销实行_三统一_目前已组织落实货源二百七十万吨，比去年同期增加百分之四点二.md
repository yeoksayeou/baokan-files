To ensure that farmers can purchase subsidized fertilizer on time, Sichuan Province has implemented the "three unifications" for fertilizer production and sales. Currently, 2.7 million tons of fertilizer have been organized and secured, an increase of 4.2% compared to the same period last year.

Our reporter, Luo Maocheng, reports from Chengdu: Recently, Sichuan Province has taken measures to ensure that farmers can purchase subsidized fertilizer on time by continuing to implement unified allocation, unified pricing, and unified operation for fertilizers, which has been well-received by the farmers.

In the past, Sichuan Province had multiple channels for fertilizer sales, leading to chaotic pricing and severe issues of buying and reselling. The government's policy of providing fertilizer in exchange for grain could not be fulfilled, and farmers were very dissatisfied. In 1987, there were over 2,300 incidents of farmers rushing to buy fertilizer across the province, resulting in 6 deaths and 70 injuries, with 247,000 farmers participating in these incidents.

Given these circumstances, Sichuan Province changed its policy in 1988 to have the Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (供销社) take over the unified operation of fertilizers. This increased the available supply and ensured that the subsidized fertilizer for farmers could be provided on time. Simultaneously, the provincial government mandated that all fertilizers be managed by the agricultural resources department, leading to a significant increase in the amount of small-scale fertilizers collected by this department. In 1987, the agricultural resources department's collection volume accounted for 74.5% of the total, which increased to over 90% in 1988. This measure effectively curbed the activities of buying and reselling, price gouging, and additional fees, and initially rectified the operational channels.

To ensure a smooth fertilizer supply this year, various levels of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Sichuan Province have established agricultural resources specialized management groups or offices. They have publicly announced the types, quantities, prices, supply methods, and supply times of fertilizers, accepting public supervision. Currently, the province has organized and secured 2.7 million tons of fertilizer, an increase of 4.2% compared to the same period last year. The subsidized fertilizer supplied to farmers will be guaranteed to be delivered in installments according to the plan.

　　为确保农民及时买到平价化肥    
    四川对化肥产销实行“三统一”    
    目前已组织落实货源二百七十万吨，比去年同期增加百分之四点二
    本报成都电  记者罗茂城报道：最近，四川省为保证农民能够及时买到平价化肥，采取措施对化肥继续实行统一分配、统一定价、统一经营，受到农民欢迎。
    四川过去对化肥实行多渠道经营，价格混乱，倒买倒卖现象严重，政府给农民的粮挂肥不能兑现，农民意见很大。１９８７年，四川全省发生大小抢购化肥事件２３００多起，死６人、伤７０多人，参与抢购化肥的农民达２４．７万多人次。
    根据这些情况，四川去年改由供销社统一经营化肥，使可供分配的货源增加，给农民的平价肥能及时兑现。同时，省政府规定，化肥统归农资部门经营，使农资部门收购的小化肥数量迅速增加。１９８７年农资部门收购量占总量的７４．５％，去年上升到９０％以上。这一措施有效地刹住了平转议、乱收费、乱涨价等倒买倒卖活动，初步理顺了经营渠道。
    为搞好今年的化肥供应，四川省各级供销社均成立了农资专营领导小组或办公室，张榜公布供应化肥的品种、数量、价格、供应办法和供应时间，接受群众的监督。目前，全省已组织落实了化肥货源２７０万吨，比去年同期增加４．２％。对农民供应的平价肥将能保证分期按计划兑现。
