Cloud Dream County is located in the northern part of the Jianghan Plain and is a small county with convenient transportation and a vibrant economy. According to statistics from April 1988, 9.8% of junior high school students and 2.1% of primary school students have dropped out. The dropout of junior high and primary school students is a crisis facing basic education in the new situation and is a major issue related to the implementation of the Compulsory Education Law and the improvement of national quality. To quickly eliminate this crisis, we believe that we must first effectively address the prominent issues currently existing in basic education.

The basic characteristic of students dropping out midway is that junior high school has a more severe situation than primary school, and some general junior high schools are on the verge of closure due to a large number of students dropping out. Why are general junior high schools facing such a crisis? The root cause lies in the incorrect guiding ideology of running schools and the one-sided pursuit of admission rates. Some leaders still use the admission rate as the sole criterion for evaluating the quality of a school. Students and parents believe that the teaching level of general junior high schools is low, the teaching quality is poor, and students can't get out of the "farm gate" even after studying for a few years, so it's better not to study. Under the pressure of public opinion from all sectors of society, the enthusiasm of teachers in general junior high schools is dampened, and their initiative cannot be fully utilized. Coupled with poor school conditions, teaching quality continues to decline. Some teachers try to send a few students to key high schools and vocational schools to "save face." As a result, in teaching, they only focus on a few excellent students and neglect or even discriminate against poor-performing students. Tracking surveys of dropouts have found that 70% of them have lost confidence in learning due to poor grades.

This situation indicates that general junior high schools are in a state of continuous decline: the more they pursue admission rates one-sidedly, the less they get fair evaluation and treatment; the less they get fair evaluation and treatment, the more teaching quality declines, and the more severe student dropout becomes.

To address this, the following measures should be taken: First, the county education administrative department should establish and improve the supervision mechanism to check, guide, and supervise the full implementation of the Party's educational policies and the implementation of the Compulsory Education Law. A scientific evaluation system should be established to guide public opinion to free schools from the shackles of one-sided pursuit of admission rates. Second, key schools should be abolished, and efforts should be made to create equal competition conditions in terms of human, financial, material resources, and student enrollment. The vitality of all schools should be universally enhanced to promote a large-scale improvement in teaching quality, so that students can enter, stay, and learn well. Through reform, the quality education concept of the whole society should be continuously strengthened, the admission education psychology should be gradually weakened, and the situation of "thousands of soldiers and horses rushing through a single plank bridge" should be changed. The pressure of admission on teachers and students should be reduced to ensure the full implementation of educational policies.

　　湖北省云梦县教委——
    农村初中生何以严重流失？
    片面追求升学率使大部分学生丧失学习信心
    云梦县地处江汉平原北部，是一个交通便利，经济活跃的小县。据１９８８年４月统计，全县有９．８％的初中生，２．１％的小学生辍学。中、小学生辍学是新形势下基础教育面临的一种危机，是关系到能否实施义务教育法、提高国民素质的一个重大问题。要想迅速消除这种危机，我们认为首先必须切实解决好目前基础教育中存在的突出问题。
    学生中途停学的一个基本特点是初中比小学严重，个别一般初中因学生大量停学濒于关闭。一般初中为何面临此种危机呢？从中作祟的是办学指导思想不端正，片面追求升学率。有些领导仍然以升学率高低作为衡量一所学校好坏的标准。学生和家长认为，一般初中教师水平低，教学质量差，学生读几年也跳不出“农门”，不如不读。在来自社会各方面的舆论压力下，一般初中的教师情绪低落，积极性得不到发挥，加上办学条件差，致使教学质量不断下降。一些教师想通过送几个学生上重点高中和中专，以挽回“名声”。结果，在教学中只重少数优等生，放弃甚至歧视差等生。从对辍学的学生追踪调查发现，７０％是因为功课差对学习失去了信心。
    这一情况表明，一般初中正处在不断下滑的状态：越片面追求升学率，越得不到公正的评价和待遇；越得不到公正的评价和待遇，教学质量就越下降，学生流失就越严重。
    为此，应该采取以下对策：一是县教育行政部门要建立和健全督导机构，负责检查指导和督促党的教育方针的全面落实和义务教育法的贯彻实施，建立科学的评价体系，引导社会舆论把学校从片面追求升学率的桎梏中解放出来。二是取消重点学校，努力在人力、财力、物力和生源等方面创造平等的竞争条件，普遍增强学校活力，促进教学质量大面积提高，从而使学生进得来，留得住，学得好。通过改革使全社会的素质教育观念不断强化，升学教育心理逐步淡化，改变千军万马挤独木桥的局面，减轻师生的升学压力，保证教育方针的全面贯彻。
