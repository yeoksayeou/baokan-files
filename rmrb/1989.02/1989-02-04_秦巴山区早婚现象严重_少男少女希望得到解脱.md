Edition: 5

The Qinling and Daba Mountains are located in the border region between Sichuan and Shaanxi. This area is one of the poorest regions in China. For many years, young men and women here have been bound by the tradition of "parental commands" that are difficult to defy, leading to absurd and distorted marriage practices. In recent years, the rate of early marriages in this region has been rising again. In Pingli County, rural areas have seen a trend of arranging "childhood marriages," with some children under 15 years old already engaged. In one village, out of 192 young men and women aged 15 to 20, 133 have already been engaged. Even more astonishingly, in another village, 80% of children aged two or three have had their "childhood marriages" arranged. Among the 38 young men and women who have registered for marriage, 25 are under the legal marriage age.

It is suggested that relevant departments strengthen the propaganda and education of the Marriage Law among the villagers, to liberate many young men and women from poverty, ignorance, and sadness.

　　秦巴山区早婚现象严重  少男少女希望得到解脱
    秦岭、大巴山山区位于川陕交界地带。这一带是我国贫困地区之一。多年来，这里的青年男女由于“父母之命”难违，荒唐、畸形的婚姻形式十分普遍。近年来，这一地区早婚率又呈回升趋势。平利县农村订“娃娃亲”成风，一些不到１５岁的孩子都订了婚。一个村１５至２０岁的青年男女１９２人，已订婚的有１３３人。更有甚者，有个村二三岁小孩中，订“娃娃亲”的竟占８０％；登记结婚的３８名男女青年中，就有２５人不到法定婚龄。
    建议有关部门加强对村民进行婚姻法的宣传教育，把众多的少男少女从贫困、愚昧和悲哀中解脱出来。
