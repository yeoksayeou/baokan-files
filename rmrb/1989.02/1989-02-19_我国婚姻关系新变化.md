What are the new changes in marital relations among the Chinese population today?

According to experts, in 1987, the widower rate among married individuals in China decreased by 1.09 percentage points compared to 1982. This is mainly due to a reduction in the proportion of widows and widowers aged 50 and above. This is directly related to the increase in their lifespan and the number of remarriages. Statistics show that currently, among every 100 married individuals over the age of 50, approximately 15 men and 35 women have lost their spouses. The divorce rate in 1987 decreased by 0.14 percentage points compared to 1982. The age group of 35 to 39 seems to be a "danger period," with a noticeable upward trend in divorce rates. Officials from the National Bureau of Statistics believe that currently, marital relations in Chinese families are relatively stable, and the primary cause of marital dissolution is widowhood.

The increase in early marriages and the lowering of the initial marriage age are the most prominent changes in the current marital structure in China. In 1987, the average initial marriage age for men in China was 23.66 years, and for women, it was 21.01 years, a decrease of 1.83 years and 1.79 years respectively compared to 1982. The custom of early marriage has resurfaced in recent years. In 1987, among the population aged 15 to 21 for men and 15 to 19 for women who had not yet reached the legal marriage age, 4.91% were already married, an increase of 1.67 percentage points compared to 1982. Currently, the peak childbearing age for women in China has advanced from 25 to 23 years old, which means that approximately 40 million women may give birth earlier. This is extremely detrimental to controlling population growth.

The proportion of older unmarried individuals and those who remain unmarried for life in China is decreasing, but the numbers are still significant.

　　我国婚姻关系新变化
    当今我国人口婚姻关系有何新变化？
    据专家们分析，１９８７年我国已婚人口中丧偶率比１９８２年下降１．０９个百分点，主要是５０岁及５０岁以上人口的丧偶比重减少。这与他们的寿命延长和再婚人数增加有直接关系。统计数字表明，目前全国每１００名年过半百的已婚公民中，约有１５个男性和３５个女性失去了妻子或丈夫。１９８７年离婚率比１９８２年下降０．１４个百分点。３５至３９岁年龄仿佛是“危险期”，离婚率上升趋向明显。国家统计局人士认为，目前我国家庭婚姻关系稳定，造成婚姻解体的主要原因是丧偶。
    早婚现象增加，初婚年龄降低，是目前我国婚姻构成中最突出的变化。１９８７年我国男性平均初婚年龄为２３．６６岁，女性为２１．０１岁，比１９８２年分别下降１．８３岁和１．７９岁。早婚习俗近年重有抬头。１９８７年，在尚未达到法定婚龄的男１５岁至２１岁、女１５岁至１９岁人口中，已婚者占４．９１％，比１９８２年上升１．６７个百分点。目前我国妇女的生育峰值年龄已由２５岁提前到２３岁，这意味着全国大约有４０００万妇女可能提前生育，这对控制人口增长是极其不利的。
    我国大龄未婚和“终身不婚”人口比重在下降，但人数仍然不少。
