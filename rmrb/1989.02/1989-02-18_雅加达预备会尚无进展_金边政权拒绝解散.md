	Jakarta Preparatory Meeting Makes No Progress
	Phnom Penh Regime Refuses to Dissolve

	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The second preparatory meeting for the Jakarta informal conference on the Cambodian issue opened in Jakarta on Feb. 16. No progress was made on the first day.

	Representatives from the three factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, the Phnom Penh regime, Vietnam, Laos, and six ASEAN countries attended the meeting, which was held to prepare for the second informal conference to be held on Feb. 19.

	After the first day's meeting, a Thai representative said the meeting ended in serious disagreements. The representatives did not reach any actual peace agreement but only discussed the "technical aspects" of peace in Cambodia.

	The Democratic Kampuchea side distributed Prince Sihanouk's five-point peace plan during the meeting.

	Before the meeting, the three factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea held a 45-minute talk with the Phnom Penh regime. In a press conference after the meeting, a representative from the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea said the Phnom Penh regime "still insists on its past rigid attitude, which is not conducive to a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue."

	The statement further said, "Without dissolving this illegal (Phnom Penh) regime's administrative and military organizations, it is impossible to hold fair and free elections in Cambodia."

	HANOI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A statement by the spokesperson of the Phnom Penh regime's foreign ministry, published in Hanoi newspapers today, indicates that the Phnom Penh regime has formally rejected the proposal made by Prince Sihanouk, chairman of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, in Beijing last week, which called for the dissolution of the Phnom Penh regime.

	The statement by the Phnom Penh regime's foreign ministry spokesperson claims that the proposal is "extremely unfair" given the insistence on establishing a four-party government led by Prince Sihanouk and a four-party army commanded by him.

	The statement said that if external assistance to all warring factions within Cambodia is stopped, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia this year. If no solution to the Cambodian conflict is found, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops by 1990.

	Observers here believe that the statements made by Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime on the eve of the second Jakarta informal conference indicate that they are seeking excuses to delay the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.

　　雅加达预备会尚无进展
    金边政权拒绝解散
    新华社北京２月１７日电  雅加达消息：关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议预备会１６日在雅加达开幕。第一天的预备会没有取得任何进展。
    参加会议的有民柬联合政府３方、金边政权、越南、老挝和东南亚国家联盟６国的代表。会议是为２月１９日举行第二次非正式会议作准备的。
    第一天会议结束后，泰国代表说，会议是在严重分歧中结束的，各方代表没有达成任何实际的和平协议，而只是讨论了有关柬埔寨和平的“技术方面”的问题。
    民主柬埔寨方面在会上散发了西哈努克的五点和平计划。
    另外在会前，民柬３方同金边政权单独举行了４５分钟会谈。民柬代表在会后举行的记者招待会上发表声明说，金边政权方面“仍坚持过去僵硬的态度，这种态度无助于柬埔寨问题的全面解决。”
    声明又说：“在未解散这个（金边）非法政权的行政和军事组织的情况下，（在柬埔寨）举行公正和自由的大选是不可能的。”
    新华社河内２月１７日电　河内报纸今天刊载的柬埔寨金边政权外交部发言人声明表明，金边政权正式拒绝了由民主柬埔寨联合政府主席西哈努克亲王上周在北京提出的关于要求解散金边政权的建议。
    金边外交部发言人的声明声称，在对方坚持必须建立以西哈努克为首的四方政府和以西哈努克为总司令的四方军队的时候，上述建议显然是“极为不公正”的。
    声明说，如果外界停止对所有柬埔寨内部交战各方的援助，那么，越南将于今年全部从柬撤军。如果没有找到一项解决柬埔寨冲突的办法，越南将于１９９０年全部从柬撤军。
    此间观察家认为，越南和金边政权在关于柬埔寨问题第二次雅加达非正式会议即将召开前夕发表的言论表明，它们正在为推迟越南全部从柬埔寨撤军制造借口。
