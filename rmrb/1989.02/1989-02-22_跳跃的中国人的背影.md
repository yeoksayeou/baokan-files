	The Leaping Back of the Chinese People
	Laoyu

	To live is such a wonderful thing. After the clamor of youth has passed, I shouted this out.

	The poet Blue once vividly described the heavy backs of the Chinese people—

	Chinese people, ah, the backs of the Chinese people
	Do the Chinese people only have backs?
	They are always hurriedly leaving
	Never turning their heads back
	Even at midnight, many heavy backs
	Flash before you

	Several years ago, on an autumn night, reading these lines made my spirit tremble; this is the Chinese people. My back has also left a heavy impression on passersby. My father's back, my grandfather's back, every day they flash heavily before my eyes, so heavily that I want to cry out loud!

	In this winter's open space, I begin to be stirred and moved by the backs leaping freely around the ancient plaza; I begin to be cleansed and intoxicated by a breath of life! Among the crowd of heavy figures, a few, a few dozen, a few hundred restless backs turn around, looking at us, leaping alone!

	I am a genuine Chinese person. My hometown is located in the birthplace of Han culture—Qinchuang. Twenty-five years of wandering and struggle have made me deeply aware of the difficulty of breaking free from ancient traditions and modern traditions! I am very clear that all my dreams and beliefs are nurtured by this land. From a six-and-a-half-pound baby to a man covered in dust, how many times have I been trimmed by scissors, kneaded by old hands? Fortunately, from the age of five, in that evening when I gazed at the red sun, I understood: life is something that no force can destroy!

	Life may be fragile, love may be even more difficult, expressing yourself may require the price of blood, ... but compared to the death that is approaching us day by day, what is more worth trying than living, loving, and expressing oneself?

	I can be a good person, a person everyone likes, but imagine, under the gaze of the crowd, that me who fits the audience's taste, suppressing all desires and impulses of life, smiling mechanically, turning my body for them to admire, I would shiver with cold! Around me, there are those who hide, there are those who are clever in all directions, knowing my lack of skill, I might as well walk naked to the grass by the moat, bask in the warm sun, let those refined gazes inspect me, I am myself, an irreplaceable, uncopyable life! Nothing is more delightful than being myself, nothing is more worthy of pride than doing what I want to do and saying what I want to say!

	After the noise of the day subsides, how many souls can quietly enter a dream? Under the dim desk lamp, my teacher and I sit side by side, page by page, understanding the depth of thoughts of Fromm, who has long fallen asleep. Starting from the familiar phenomena of daily life, he discovers with keen insight the sadness hidden deep in the hearts of modern people—proclaiming the self while gradually losing the true self. In the last days of the 20th century, marked by refrigerators, color TVs, VCRs, and dollar signs of self-worth, chewing on words, one by one, on wasted or unwasted past events, trying to find the rare meaning of individual life in the memories of falling leaves, this may also have something worth rejoicing about in a somewhat mysterious and gloomy courtyard in Beijing.

	After several rounds of tea, the house gradually turns white. The light that has burned all night should be extinguished in this clearness.

　　跳跃的中国人的背影
    老愚
    活下去是多么美妙的一桩事情。青春期的喧嚣过去之后，我这么喊了一声。
    诗人蓝色曾传神地描绘了中国人沉重的背影——
    中国人，唉，中国人的背影
    难道中国人只有背影
    他们总是在匆匆地离去
    从不把头回过来
    即使深夜，也有很多沉重的背影
    在你面前闪过
    几年前的一个秋夜，读到这样的诗句我的灵魏不禁一颤；这就是中国人。我的背影也曾经留给路人沉重的印象。我父亲的背影，我父亲的父亲的背影每天沉重地从我眼前闪过，沉重得使我想放声恸哭！
    在这个冬天的开阔地带，我开始被飘逸地跳跃于古老广场四周的背影所激动，所撩拨；我开始被一股生命的气息所洗涤，所陶醉！在成群沉重的行列里，有几个几十个几百个不安分的背影潇洒地转过头，望着我们独自跳跃了！
    我是一个地道的中国人，我的家乡坐落于汉文化的发祥地——秦川；２５个春秋的跋涉与抗争，使我深知挣脱古老传统及现代传统的艰难！我很清楚，我的一切梦呓和信念全由这土地所孕育，从一个六斤半重的小生命转瞬而为一个披满灰尘的男人，其间被多少把剪刀修剪过，被多少双老手揉捏过？庆幸的是；从五岁那个凝望红太阳的黄昏起，我就明白；生命是什么力量也毁灭不了的！
    生命或许很脆弱，爱或许更艰难，表达你自己甚至要付出血的代价，……但相对于一天天向我们逼近的死亡来说，又有什么比生活着爱着表达着更值得去尝试的呢？！
    我能做一个好人，一个大家都喜欢的好人，但想象在众人的注视下，那个合乎观众口胃的我，压抑着生命的一切渴望和冲动，面含笑容机械似地翻转身躯，任他们赏玩，我就不寒而栗！在四周有的是隐蔽者，有的是八面伪装的智者，自知于功力的欠缺，我索性赤身裸体走到护城河的草地上，晒温和的太阳，任那些精致的目光审视吧，我就是我，是一个不可替代不可复制的生命！没有什么比我是我自己更令人欣喜的了，没有什么比我做我想做的事说我想说的话更值得骄傲的了！
    白天的喧闹沉寂之后，有几个灵魂能悄然而入梦呢？在昏黄的台灯下，我和我的老师并排而坐，一页一页领会早已安睡的弗罗姆的思想深度。他从日常生活里司空见惯的现象出发，独具慧眼地发现了深藏于现代人心底的悲哀——标榜自我却又日胜一日地丧失了真正的自我。在电冰箱、彩电、录像机、美元标志自我价值的２０世纪最后的日子里，一字一句咀嚼荒废或未曾荒废的往事，企图于一片片落叶的回忆里，追寻个体生命难得的意蕴，这在略显神秘阴森的北京一个大院里，亦或有值得欣喜之处。
    几巡饮茶，屋子渐近于白了，燃了一宿的灯光，在这晴明里，该熄了。
