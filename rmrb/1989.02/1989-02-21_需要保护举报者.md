It is reported that in Zhejiang's Sheng County, an accountant from a pharmaceutical factory was dismissed for exposing the factory director's problems and was left unemployed for 23 months. Even after the provincial leaders intervened, the issue was not properly resolved.

Such news is regrettable. No wonder in some places where "spring winds do not blow," people hesitate to blow the whistle. Even in places where whistleblowing is relatively active, there are more anonymous whistleblowers than those who reveal their true identities.

It is no surprise that the masses are not enthusiastic. After all, those being reported often hold significant power, and if things go wrong, the whistleblowers will have a hard time. Therefore, the key is not how to mobilize the masses to blow the whistle, but how to protect the whistleblowers after they do.

To achieve this, there should be a "Whistleblower Protection Law." In my opinion, it should include the following: keeping the whistleblower's name, workplace, and the content of the report confidential, and punishing those who violate this rule, with severe cases being prosecuted for dereliction of duty; if the reported person retaliates, they should be dealt with seriously according to the severity of the offense; problems reported should be addressed one by one, and major issues should be promptly reported to the relevant authorities; leaders at all levels should adhere to discipline and respect the law, not allowing them to write letters or make phone calls to "pull strings," and should insist on facts and the law, not showing favoritism. Of course, there should also be a clause that if someone uses the opportunity to slander and defame, once the truth is revealed, they should be seriously dealt with and held legally responsible.

　　需要保护举报者
     李兴文
    报载：浙江嵊县一个药厂会计因揭发厂长的问题，竟被解聘，“晾”在一边２３个月。虽经省里主要领导人过问，仍未得到妥善解决。
    这样的消息令人慨叹。难怪在一些“春风不度”的“玉门关”里，人们望“举报”而却步。即使是一些举报工作比较活跃的地方，也出现了匿名举报者多，真名举报者少的现象。
    莫怪群众不积极不踊跃，须知被举报者，相当多数都是有权之辈，搞不好，举报者没好日子过。因而问题的关键不在于如何发动群众举报，而是举报之后如何保护举报者。
    要做到这一点，应有一个“举报法”。以愚之见，应包括以下内容：对举报人的姓名、工作单位及举报内容予以保密，违者给以处分，后果严重的要按渎职罪追究责任；被举报者如有打击报复行为，要视其情节轻重严肃处理；举报出来的问题要争取件件有着落，重大问题要及时将查处情况向主管部门回复；各级领导要遵守纪律、尊重法律，不准写条子打电话“走后门”说情，要坚持以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，不徇私情，等等。当然，还应包括一条，如有借举报之机造谣中伤者，一俟查清也要严肃处理，依法追究其责任。
