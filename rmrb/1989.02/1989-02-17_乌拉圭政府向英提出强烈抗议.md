The Uruguayan government on February 14 lodged a strong protest with the British government over a British Royal Air Force plane that flew from Uruguay back to the Malvinas Islands.

The plane, carrying 137 passengers and 8 crew members, took off from the British mainland on February 10 bound for the Malvinas Islands, which are disputed between Argentina and Britain. Due to bad weather on the islands, the plane made an emergency landing in Uruguay with the approval of the Uruguayan government. According to the agreement reached between Uruguay and Britain, the plane was only allowed to fly back to the British base on Ascension Island. However, after flying for 1,000 kilometers, the British plane suddenly changed course and flew back to the Malvinas Islands.

　　乌拉圭政府向英提出强烈抗议
    乌拉圭政府十四日就英国皇家航空公司的一架军用飞机从乌拉圭飞回马尔维纳斯群岛一事向英国政府提出强烈抗议。
    这架载有一百三十七名乘客和八名机组人员的飞机二月十日从英国本土起飞前往阿根廷和英国之间有争议的马尔维纳斯群岛。由于马岛气候不好，经乌拉圭政府同意在乌拉圭紧急降落。根据乌、英双方达成的协议，这架飞机起飞后只能飞回英国的阿森松岛。但是，英国飞机在飞行一千公里后，突然转变航向，飞回马尔维纳斯群岛。
