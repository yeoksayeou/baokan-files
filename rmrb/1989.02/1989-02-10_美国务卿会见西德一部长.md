U.S. Secretary of State Meets West German Minister

U.S. Secretary of State James Baker met with visiting West German Chancellor's Office Minister Wolfgang Schäuble on February 8 to discuss the control of exports of technology and equipment used to manufacture nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.

State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that Baker was encouraged by Schäuble's stance on this issue during their talks. West Germany announced last month that it would strictly control the export of technology and equipment used to produce nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
