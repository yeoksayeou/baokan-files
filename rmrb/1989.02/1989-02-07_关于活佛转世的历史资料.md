The reincarnation system of Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism began with the Karmapa of the Kagyu sect (commonly known as the White Hat sect). The founder of the Kagyu sect, Dusum Khyenpa, passed away in 1193. In 1204, the first Karmapa was born. As a child, the first Karmapa studied the teachings of the White Hat sect established by Dusum Khyenpa and became very proficient. His followers revered him as the reincarnation of Dusum Khyenpa, making the first Karmapa the first Living Buddha in Tibetan Buddhism. This marked the beginning of the reincarnation system of Living Buddhas. After Tsongkhapa established the Gelug sect (commonly known as the Yellow Hat sect), he also adopted the reincarnation method. Tsongkhapa's two major disciples, the first Dalai Lama and the first Panchen Lama, were both reincarnated. From the first Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup, to the current Tenzin Gyatso, there have been 14 Dalai Lamas. From the first Panchen Lama, Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, to the recently deceased Choekyi Gyaltsen, there have been 10 Panchen Lamas.

The reincarnation of the Panchen Lama generally involves five procedures:

1. **Searching for the Reincarnated Child**: This process begins one year after the previous Panchen Lama's death, conducted by the monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. First, divination or invoking a protective deity is performed to determine the direction, distance, and characteristics of the reincarnated child's birthplace. Then, the monks follow these clues and search in different directions. Sometimes, only one child is found, while other times, two or more children are found. For example, during the reincarnation of the fifth and sixth Panchen Lamas, only one child was found. For the seventh Panchen Lama, four children were found, for the eighth, two children, for the ninth, three children, and for the tenth, one child.

2. **Identifying the Articles**: Items that the previous Panchen Lama frequently used and favored are collected, along with similar items of the same shape and quantity. These items are mixed together, and the child is asked to identify them. If the child picks out the items used by the previous Panchen Lama, it is believed that the child is the reincarnation of the previous Panchen Lama.

3. **Divination and Inquiry**: Tashilhunpo Monastery invokes a protective deity to ask which child is the reincarnation of the previous Panchen Lama. If the deity's response matches the result of the article identification, the child becomes a candidate for reincarnation.

4. **Golden Urn Drawing**: During the Qing Dynasty, the results of the identification and divination were reported to the emperor by the Imperial Resident in Tibet for approval. If only one candidate was found, the emperor would approve without drawing lots. If two or more candidates were found, the emperor would order a golden urn drawing.

5. **Approval for Succession**: The result of the golden urn drawing is reported to the emperor, who then approves the succession of the new Panchen Lama.

In the seventh year of the Kangxi reign (1668), the Kangxi Emperor approved Lobzang Yeshe as the fifth Panchen Lama. In the fifth year of the Qianlong reign (1740), the Qianlong Emperor approved Padma Yeshe as the sixth Panchen Lama. In the forty-seventh year of the Qianlong reign (1782), the Qianlong Emperor approved Danba Nimma as the seventh Panchen Lama. In the seventh year of the Xianfeng reign (1857), the Xianfeng Emperor approved Danba Wangchuk as the eighth Panchen Lama. In the fourteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1888), the Guangxu Emperor approved Chokyi Nyima as the ninth Panchen Lama.

The golden urn drawing system was established by the Qianlong Emperor. The golden urn is kept in the Potala Palace in Lhasa. The drawing is conducted by the Imperial Resident in Tibet. The method is as follows: if the identification and divination results yield two or more candidates, their names are written on ivory slips, one for each candidate, and placed into the golden urn. Lamas recite the Golden Urn Scripture for seven days, and then one slip is drawn from the urn. The name on the slip determines the reincarnated child, who is then reported to the emperor for approval.

The tenth Panchen Lama was approved by the then Central Government (the National Government) on June 3, 1949. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　关于活佛转世的历史资料
    藏传佛教的活佛转世制度是从噶举派（俗称白教）的噶玛巴希开始的。噶举派创始人堆松钦巴于公元１１９３年去世。公元１２０４年噶玛巴希降生。噶玛巴希幼年出家研习堆松钦巴创立的白教教义，造诣很深，信徒们推崇他为堆松钦巴的转世继承人，噶玛巴希乃成为藏传佛教的第一个活佛，从此也就有了活佛转世制度。宗喀巴创立格鲁派（俗称黄教）后，也沿用了活佛转世办法。宗喀巴的两个大弟子即一世达赖和一世班禅就用转世办法继承。达赖从第一世根敦朱巴到现在的丹增嘉措，经历了１４世。班禅从第一世克珠杰到刚刚去世的确吉坚赞，经历了１０世。
    班禅转世一般要经过五道程序。
    一，寻访灵童。在前世班禅去世一年后开始进行，由日喀则扎什伦布寺僧官执行。首先打卦或请护法神降神，确定灵童出生地的方向、路程及地方特征等，然后由僧官们按此线索分路寻访。寻访的结果，有时只找到一位灵童，有时找到两位和两位以上。如五世与六世班禅转世时只找到一位灵童，七世班禅四位灵童，八世班禅两位灵童，九世班禅三位灵童，十世班禅一位灵童。
    二，辨认器物。取前世班禅生前常用的最喜欢的器物，再取相同形状和数量的其它器物，将二者混在一起，真伪相杂，然后让灵童辨认。如果灵童抓到的都是前世班禅生前用过的器物，就认为该灵童系前世班禅转世。
    三，降神询问。由日喀则扎什伦布寺请护法神降神，询问哪一个灵童是前世班禅转世，请神降谕。如果护法神答复的同辨认器物的结果一致，则该灵童成为候选灵童。
    四，金瓶掣签。辨认和降神的结果在清朝时期由驻藏大臣向清朝皇帝报告，请求批示。如果只有一位候选灵童，则批示免予掣签。如果有两位或两位以上灵童，则批示进行金瓶掣签。
    五，批准继位。金瓶掣签的结果上报皇帝，由皇帝批准继承班禅名号，为新一世的班禅。
    康熙七年（１６６８年），康熙皇帝批准罗桑益喜为五世班禅。乾隆五年（１７４０年），乾隆皇帝批准巴丹益喜为六世班禅。乾隆四十七年（１７８２年），乾隆皇帝批准丹白尼玛为七世班禅。咸丰七年（１８５７年），咸丰皇帝批准丹白旺秋为八世班禅。光绪十四年（１８８８年），光绪皇帝批准曲吉尼玛为九世班禅。
    金瓶掣签制度是乾隆皇帝制定的。金瓶放在拉萨市布达拉宫。掣签由驻藏大臣执行。方法是，如果辨认和降神的结果有两个或两个以上的候选灵童，就将他们的名字都写在象牙签上，每人一签，都投入金瓶内。喇嘛念７天金瓶经后，从金瓶中掣出一签，签上写着谁的名字，谁就是转世灵童，即可以上报皇帝审批。
    十世班禅就是经当时的中央政府（即国民政府）于１９４９年６月３日批准的。（新华社发）
