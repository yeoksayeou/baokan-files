According to the introduction by the elderly commission of Shanxi Province Fangshan County, Li Yue Sheng, the secretary of the Party branch of Shikuang Village, Madi Hui Township, Fangshan County, Shanxi Province, has voluntarily taken care of 11 elderly people who are widowed and childless since 1958. This has been a story of virtue for 30 years.

Li Yue Sheng, 52 years old, has been a village cadre for more than 30 years. In the mid-1950s, he befriended Hu Yu Xi, an elderly man without children from Donggou Village, Guxian Town, in the same county. Hu Yu Xi was a folk artist, and Li Yue Sheng became his apprentice. The relationship between master and apprentice deepened over time. In 1967, when Hu Yu Xi was old and sick, he lost the ability to work. Li Yue Sheng cultivated the old man's private plot, ground flour, and looked after his medicine. This continued until 1970 when the old man passed away. In 1976, Li Yue Sheng voluntarily took care of Yan Zhi Shan, an elderly man from his own village. The old man was over 70 years old, his wife had passed away early, leaving only a 15-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old grandson adopted from outside. Li Yue Sheng took on the responsibility of taking care of the old man. He arranged for the old man to do some light work and also took 10 yuan from his monthly salary to support the old man until 1982 when the old man passed away. Li Yue Sheng also helped the old man's daughter get married and the grandson get a wife.

In 1984, the township Party committee sent Li Yue Sheng to Fengjiazhuang Village for a down-to-the-countryside assignment. After arriving at the village, he visited poor households, widowed and childless elderly people, and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. He also took on the responsibility of taking care of Ren En Fu, a 72-year-old widowed and childless old man, until the old man passed away.
