To save the troubled U.S. savings and loan industry, President Bush today announced a major plan in the White House.

The plan consists of four main points. 1. To rescue insolvent savings and loan associations, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which supervises the nation's 13,000 banks, will also supervise savings and loan associations, but the insurance funds for the banking industry and the savings and loan industry will remain separate. 2. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will work together with the Federal Reserve Board and the General Accounting Office to conduct joint supervision, and the Treasury Department will also participate in the management of savings institutions. 3. The government will establish a special agency to sell $500 billion in government bonds to assist troubled savings and loan associations. The $400 billion cost of closing hundreds of savings and loan associations over the past 80 years will also be paid by the government. Commercial banks and savings and loan associations will increase their savings insurance premiums, and the funds raised will be used by the government to pay off the bond interest. 4. The government will allocate an additional $50 million to the Department of Justice to investigate and punish the illegal activities of savings and loan association managers nationwide.

Bush said that the purpose of implementing the above plan is to maintain the existing financial system in the United States and prevent savings and loan associations from experiencing similar crises again. He assured that without increasing the savings costs of depositors, "the entire savings insurance system will be fully restored," and urged congressional leaders to "permanently solve this threat to the U.S. financial system" without delay.

　　为挽救美国储蓄信贷业
　  布什总统宣布一项重要方案
    本报华盛顿２月６日电  记者仓立德报道：为挽救处于困境的美国储蓄信贷业，布什总统今天下午在白宫宣布了一项重要方案。
    该方案主要有４项内容。１，为挽救失去偿债能力的储贷机构，负责监督全国１．３万家银行的联邦储蓄保险公司将同时监督储贷机构，但为银行业和储贷业的保险基金将互相分离；２，联邦储蓄保险公司、联邦储贷保险公司将同联邦储备委员会、审计署一道实行共同监督，财政部也将参与储蓄机构的管理；３，政府将成立专门机构，出售５００亿美元的公债以资助陷于困境的储贷机构。８０年以来关闭的数百家储贷机构所需的４００亿美元费用也将由政府支付。商业银行和储贷机构将增加储蓄保险金，所得款项由政府用以偿还公债利息；４，政府将向司法部增拨５０００万美元经费，由司法部负责在全国调查并惩处储贷机构管理人员的违法行为。
    布什说，实施上述方案的目的是为了维护美国现存的金融体系，防止储贷机构重新出现类似的危机。他保证在不增加储户储蓄费用的情况下“将全部储蓄保险制度完全康复”，并敦促国会领导人毫不拖延地“永久解决这一对美国财政体系的威胁”。
