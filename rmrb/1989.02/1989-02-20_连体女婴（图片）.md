In the early hours of February 17, a female worker in Urumqi gave birth to conjoined twin girls via cesarean section at the city's 23rd Hospital. The two girls together weighed 5.5 kilograms, with lengths of 47 and 48 centimeters respectively. The twins are joined from above the navel to the front of the chest, appearing as if in an embrace. They share one heart and one lung. Both girls have fully developed limbs. Currently, the mother and her twin daughters are all in good health.
