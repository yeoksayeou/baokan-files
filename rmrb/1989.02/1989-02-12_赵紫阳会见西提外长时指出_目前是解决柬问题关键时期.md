    Zhao Ziyang met with Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila today and pointed out that the current period is crucial for resolving the Cambodian issue.

    Today is the ninth anniversary of my tenure as foreign minister. It is a pleasure to meet with the General Secretary at this time," said Siddhi, who is on his 15th visit to China. Zhao Ziyang smiled and said, "Being a foreign minister is a very busy job."

    "During your tenure as Thailand's foreign minister, Thailand's diplomacy has been very active and has played an important role in international affairs. These nine years have also been the best period for friendly cooperation between our two countries," Zhao Ziyang said.

    Zhao Ziyang pointed out that the current period is crucial for resolving the Cambodian issue. Siddhi's visit this time is particularly important. The two foreign ministers exchanged views on the Cambodian issue during their talks and reached a completely consistent opinion. In the future, China, Thailand, and other ASEAN countries should cooperate better to resolve the Cambodian issue well.

    Zhao Ziyang said that the international and domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue cannot be separated. Vietnam emphasizes separating these two aspects to shirk responsibility. Hun Sen's rigid attitude is related to Vietnam. Vietnam must truly withdraw its troops from Cambodia and establish a four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk. These are two important aspects of resolving the Cambodian issue.

    When discussing Sino-Vietnamese relations, Zhao Ziyang expressed that our position is: Sino-Vietnamese relations should first resolve the Cambodian issue, including its international and domestic aspects. If the Cambodian issue is not resolved, Sino-Vietnamese relations cannot be improved.

    Siddhi expressed that Thailand and China have completely consistent views on the Cambodian issue. The Thai side will make greater efforts and work with ASEAN and other countries to push for a resolution to the Cambodian issue as soon as possible.

    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was present during the meeting.

　　赵紫阳会见西提外长时指出
    目前是解决柬问题关键时期
    本报北京２月１１日讯  记者温宪报道：“今天正好是我担任外长九周年。在这个时候见到总书记感到很高兴。”已是第１５次访问中国的泰国外长西提今天上午在中南海一见到赵紫阳总书记就高兴地说。赵紫阳笑着说，“当外长是非常繁忙的”。“在阁下担任泰国外长期间，泰国的外交很活跃，在国际事务中发挥了重要作用。这九年也是我们两国友好合作关系最好的时期。”
    赵紫阳指出，现在正处于解决柬埔寨问题的关键时期。西提外长这次来访十分重要。两国外长在会谈中就柬埔寨问题交换了意见，取得了完全一致的看法。今后，中、泰以及各东盟国家应更好地配合，把柬埔寨问题解决好。
    赵紫阳说，柬埔寨问题的国际、国内两方面不能分开解决。越南强调把这两个问题分开是为了推卸责任。洪森的态度如此僵硬，是同越南有关的。越南必须真正从柬埔寨撤军和建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府，这是解决柬埔寨问题的两个重要方面。
    在谈到中越关系时，赵紫阳表示，我们的立场是：中越之间应该首先解决好柬埔寨问题，包括其国际、国内两方面。柬埔寨问题解决不了，中越关系也就不能够得到改善。
    西提外长表示泰国和中国在柬埔寨问题上看法完全一致。泰国方面将做出自己更大的努力，同东盟以及其它国家一起，推动柬埔寨问题尽快得到解决。
    外交部长钱其琛会见时在座。
