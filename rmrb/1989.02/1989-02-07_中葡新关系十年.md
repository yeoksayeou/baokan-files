The governments of China and Portugal signed a joint communiqué establishing diplomatic relations in Paris on February 8, 1979. This marked a new starting point in Sino-Portuguese relations. The towering stone monument at the Cape of Roca in Portugal bears the grand poetic lines of the great poet Camões: "Here the land ends, and the sea begins." I feel those two lines can be aptly borrowed to describe the centuries-long exchanges between China and Portugal. The establishment of diplomatic relations in Paris marked the end of the old relationship and the beginning of a new one. Now, the first decade of this new relationship has come to a close.

Over the past 10 years, Sino-Portuguese relations have developed in a climate of warmth and prosperity. The mutual visits of the leaders of the two countries in 1984 and 1985 were of great significance in promoting political relations and bilateral friendly cooperation. The visits of the Chinese People's Congress delegation and the Portuguese Republic Parliament delegation in 1987 and 1988 strengthened the friendly ties between the parliaments and peoples of the two countries. Cultural, educational, sports, news, broadcasting, television, science and technology, publishing, and cultural exchanges between the two countries have been frequent and uninterrupted, and bilateral trade volume has steadily increased. The new relationship between the two countries is full of vitality, which is evident in all aspects.

The old Sino-Portuguese relationship left behind a problem, namely the Macao issue. With the establishment and continuous development of the new relationship, the time to resolve this historical legacy has become fully ripe. Between 1986 and 1987, the two governments held four rounds of talks on the Macao issue and reached an agreement. In April 1987, the two prime ministers signed the Joint Declaration on the Macao Issue in Beijing, which attracted worldwide attention. According to law and custom, major agreements concerning national interests must be approved by the respective legislative bodies before they can take effect. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China approved the declaration in June 1987. The Portuguese Parliament also debated and unanimously approved the joint declaration in December of the same year. On January 15 of the following year, the two sides exchanged instruments of ratification, completing all legal procedures in a solemn and dignified manner. The Joint Declaration stipulates that Macao will enter a transitional period from the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification. China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999. One country, two systems, for 50 years without change. This is the top priority in the history of Sino-Portuguese relations. The ancient Chinese historians valued the "calligraphy" in writing history. Now we should write in large letters: Sino-Portuguese cooperation has created great achievements, and the friendship between the two countries will last forever.

Westerners who came to China after Marco Polo, the Portuguese were among the earliest. However, the Chinese people did not have much understanding of that country's culture over a long period. Portugal is bordered by Spain to the east and faces the ocean to the west. Although it is located on the periphery of Europe, its culture has always been a part of the main European culture. The Moorish Saint George Castle in Lisbon and the Arab Hall in the Palace of the Bolsa in Porto, designed with great care, have attracted people's attention but have not affected the distinctive European character of the country's culture. But this is from the perspective of cultural origins and religious beliefs. The core of culture is people's ideological tendencies and values. Portugal's history is not lacking in famous figures related to cultural affairs and thought. For example, the navigator Magellan led the expedition that circumnavigated the globe, proving the roundness of the Earth for the first time, and made great contributions to the development of science. However, in history, it was not Magellan and others who shaped Portugal's cultural thought and values. In this regard, the outstanding poet Luís de Camões, who was basically unknown during his lifetime, made a unique contribution.

After graduating from university, Camões joined the military and lived in India and other Eastern countries for 17 years. After returning to Portugal, he lived on a meager military pension, but soon after his death, the value of his literary creations was discovered. Camões' "The Lusiads" and other works have been increasingly praised by people. "The Lusiads" takes the real-life navigator Vasco da Gama's voyage to India as its theme, interspersed with the intervention of gods from Greek mythology in human affairs, and praises the wisdom and bravery of the Portuguese people. His works also expose the corruption of the nobility and the court, disregard religious doctrines, affirm people's creation and enjoyment of real life. Nationalism and humanism constitute the strong characteristics of his works. Classical artistic techniques, linguistic features, and ideological characteristics are closely combined. Therefore, his works have been listed by later generations as outstanding humanist works of the Renaissance, praised and sung to this day. If Dante, Shakespeare, and Cervantes are of great importance to Italy, Britain, and Spain respectively, Camões is the same to Portugal. In 1880, the Portuguese government held a reburial ceremony for Camões and placed his remains in a famous monastery in Lisbon. The day of Camões' death was finally designated as National Day, and the state's respect for its great figures could not be higher than this. From this, one can get a glimpse of the main ideological content and values of Portuguese culture.

The current Portuguese state power is established by the people of all strata through arduous struggles, overthrowing the 40-year fascist rule of Salazar and Caetano. They emphasize decolonization and the democratic process, and they are advancing on the path of democratization. They are proud of the achievements they have made in this regard. This is, of course, an important manifestation of cultural thought and values. Modern Portuguese culture is not a simple copy or projection of the thoughts and ideas of the past. Modern and contemporary life has nurtured and formed modern national and democratic consciousness. History is indeed inseparable, but it is the modern people of Portugal who are the embodiment of this country's modern culture. Knowing its past and present is necessary for us to deepen our understanding, broaden our exchanges, and learn from its strengths.

In December 1987, I visited Portugal as a member of the Chinese People's Congress delegation for nearly a week. The mountains and rivers there are magnificent, and the people are outstanding. The Lisbon Cathedral, the nearby Bena Palace, and modern scientific and cultural facilities coexist in harmony. The Isturil and Cascais described in Herman Wouk's "The Winds of War" are scenic spots with beautiful scenery, not false beauties. The first vice-president of the Portuguese Parliament, Mrs. Manuel Aquiar, Mr. Antonio Motta, and the director of the Parliamentary Public Relations Bureau, Mr. Pires, accompanied the delegation on its visit. Our topics were very broad, and sometimes we talked about purely academic matters. They were knowledgeable and spoke with authority.

The Chinese "Ming Veritable Records" refers to Portugal as "Fulangji" or "Puduliya." Zhang Weihua's "Annotations on the History of Four European Countries in the Ming Dynasty" says: "Fulangji is the name used by the Ming people for the Portuguese and Spanish people," but believes that this is a translation based on the habits of Arab merchants and is not credible. I happened to ask Mr. Pires and Mrs. Aquiar: The ancient Chinese books refer to Portugal as "Fulangji." From the perspective of Portuguese documents, I wonder if there is any basis? After a moment's thought, Mr. Pires said that Fulangji might refer to a sect. The name of this sect is Francisco (FRANCISCO). It originated in Spain, and in the 15th and 16th centuries, it was very influential in both Spain and Portugal. Many believers emphasized their sect's name to both internal and external audiences, and the Chinese people might have thought that this was the name of their country. Mrs. Aquiar agreed very much. She especially added that the people of Goa in India also call Portugal Francisco. Their conversation made me think of a Chinese proverb: "A single conversation with you is better than reading ten years of books." A case that has been disputed for hundreds of years, I think their conversation solved it. The reason why the Ming people used the same name for the people of Spain and Portugal is also explained here. As for "Puduliya," during our visit to the second-largest city in Portugal, Porto, our friends there proudly told us: There was Porto (PORTO) first, and then Portugal (PORTUGAL). The first four letters of the two names are the same. Porto means port, and the later Porto or Portugal is obviously derived from the ancient port city. When it was transmitted to distant China, it became "Puduliya," which is quite close to the current name. This visit made Portugal's humanities and scenery concrete and vivid to me. It is no longer the "Fulangji" or "Puduliya" in the "Ming Veritable Records."

The new Sino-Portuguese relations opened by the Paris Agreement are about to enter the second decade. The cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields over the past decade has brought real benefits and honor to both sides, and each side has sufficient reason to be satisfied. Since the signing of the Joint Declaration on the Macao issue, Macao has been stable and the economic situation has been good, proving that it is a good declaration that reflects the will of the people. "Heaven's time is not as good as the local advantage, and the local advantage is not as good as the harmony of the people." Harmony is friendship and cooperation. Adhering to this will surely bring new benefits and new honor to both sides in the future. We warmly welcome the arrival of the second decade of the new Sino-Portuguese relations.

　　中葡新关系十年
　　刘大年
    中葡两国政府1979年2月8日在巴黎签署建交联合公报。这是中葡关系的新起点。葡萄牙罗卡角巍峨的石碑上，刻着大诗人卡蒙斯这样的雄奇诗句：“地尽于此，海始于斯”。我觉得那两句诗很可以借来形容中葡两国间几个世纪的交往。巴黎建交，旧的关系尽于此，新的关系始于斯。现在，这种新关系的第一个10年已经届满。
    10年来，中葡新关系是在阳光和煦、百木争荣的气候中发展的。1984年、1985年两国元首进行互访，对增进两国政治关系、推动双边友好合作，有重要意义。中国人大代表团与葡萄牙共和国议会代表团，于1987年、1988年互相访问，密切了两国议会和人民间的友好联系。双方文艺、教育、体育、新闻、广播电视、科学技术、出版、文化界团组来往频繁，文化交流连绵不断，双边贸易额稳步上升。两国新关系充满了生命力，这在各个方面都有所显示。
    旧的中葡关系中遗留下了一个问题，那就是澳门问题。新关系建立并不断得到发展，解决这个历史遗留问题的时机，臻于完全成熟了。1986年至1987年，两国政府就澳门问题举行四轮会谈，达成协议。1987年4月两国总理在北京签署关于澳门问题的联合声明，举世瞩目。根据法律和惯例，事关国家利益的重大协议，必须由各自的立法机关批准，方能生效。中国人大常委会于1987年6月批准了声明。葡萄牙议会同年12月也就批准联合声明进行辩论，一致通过。去年1月15日双方互换批准书，有关的法律手续至此全部办理完毕，庄严郑重。联合声明中规定，自互换批准书之日起，澳门进入过渡时期。中国于1999年12月20日对澳门恢复行使主权。一国两制，50年不变。这是中葡两国关系史上的头等大事。中国古人写历史看重
  “书法”。现在我们应该大书特书：中葡合作创建伟绩，两国友好长展鸿篇。
    西方人到中国，马可·波罗以后，葡萄牙人是来得最早的。但是中国人在长时间里对那个国家的文化说不上太多的了解。葡萄牙东面毗连西班牙，西冲大洋。虽然地处欧洲边陲，它的文化一向是欧洲主体文化的一部分。里斯本摩尔人留下的圣若热古堡、波尔图博尔沙宫精心设计的阿拉伯大厅，受到人们的注意，却不影响这个国家的欧洲文化的鲜明性格。但这是从文化渊源、宗教信仰等来说的。文化的核心是人们的思想倾向、价值观念。葡萄牙历史上不缺少与文化事业和思想有关的知名人物。例如航海家麦哲伦领导的航行环绕地球一周，第一次证明地圆说，对科学发展建立了伟大功绩。不过在历史上塑造了葡萄牙文化思想、价值观念的并非麦哲伦等人。在这方面作出了独特贡献的，是路易斯·瓦斯·德·卡蒙斯那位生前基本上是默默无闻的杰出诗人。
    卡蒙斯自大学出来以后从军，先后生活于印度等东方国家17年。回到葡萄牙以后靠微薄的退伍军人年金养老，然而卡蒙斯死后不久，他的文学创作的价值被人发现了。卡蒙斯的《卢济塔尼亚人之歌》和其他诗作，越来越受到人们的称赞。《卢济塔尼亚人之歌》以实有人物航海家瓦斯科·达·伽马远航印度为线索，穿插希腊神话中诸神对人间的干预，歌颂葡萄牙人民的聪明才智、勇敢精神。他的诗作也揭露贵族和宫廷的腐败，不顾宗教教义，肯定人对现实生活的创造和享受。民族主义、人文主义这种双重思想构成他的作品的强烈特色。古典的艺术手法、语言特点和思想特色紧密结合在一起。那些作品因此被后人列入文艺复兴时期杰出的人文主义作品之林，赞扬传颂至今。如果但丁、莎士比亚、塞万提斯对意大利、英国和西班牙各自具有极大的重要性，卡蒙斯对葡萄牙也是一样。1880年葡萄牙政府重新为卡蒙斯举行葬礼，把他的遗体安置在里斯本一个著名的修道院里。卡蒙斯去世的日子最后被定为国庆日，国家给予它的伟大人物的敬礼不能比这更崇高了。葡萄牙文化的主要思想内含、价值观念如何，人们从这里不难窥见个梗概。
    现在的葡萄牙国家政权，是各阶层人民经过艰苦斗争，推翻了萨拉查、卡埃塔诺40多年的法西斯统治以后建立起来的。他们强调非殖民化和民主进程，他们正在民主化的道路上前进。他们为这方面所取得的成就而感到自豪。这当然是文化思想、价值观念的重要表现。葡萄牙的现代文化，也并非前人思想观念的单纯复制、投影，近代、现代生活，孕育、形成了现代的民族、民主意识。历史固然不可分割，葡萄牙的现代人才是这个国家现代文化的体现者。知道它的过去和现在，对于我们增进了解，广泛开展交流，吸收其中之所长，都是需要的。
    1987年12月，我作为中国人大代表团的一员访问葡萄牙将近一周。那里山川壮丽，人物俊彦。里斯本主教堂、不远的贝纳宫与现代科学文化设施并峙兼美。赫尔曼·沃克《战争风云》中描写的伊斯图里尔以及卡斯卡伊斯等海滨胜地，景色宜人，信非虚美。葡第一副议长曼努埃尔·阿基亚尔女士、安东尼奥·莫塔议员、议会公共关系局局长皮雷斯先生陪同代表团访问。我们的话题很广，有时谈起纯粹书本子上的事，他们知识渊博，谈吐有根有据。
    中国《明实录》上称葡萄牙为“佛郎机”或“蒲都利加”。张维华的《明史欧洲四国传注释》说：“佛郎机为明朝人对于葡萄牙人与西班牙人之称呼”，但认为这是回回商人根据自己习惯翻译而成，殊不足以取信。我偶然问起皮雷斯先生和阿基亚尔女士：中国古书上称葡萄牙为“佛郎机”，从葡萄牙文献上看，不知有何根据？皮雷斯先生略加思索后说，佛郎机可能是指的一个教派。这个教派名佛郎西斯科（FRANCISCO）。它创始于西班牙，15、16世纪，在西葡两国势力极盛。众多的教徒对内对外都要强调自己教派的名子，中国人可能以为这就是他们国家的名称了。阿基亚尔女士表示很同意。她特别补充说，印度果阿人也称葡萄牙为佛郎西斯。他们两位的回答，使我不觉想起中国一句俗语：“同君一席话，胜读十年书”。几百年来其说不一的一个疑案，我认为他们的谈话把它解决了。明朝人其所以对西葡两国人使用同一称呼，也从这里得到了可靠解释。至于“蒲都利加”又是怎么来的，在葡第二大城市波尔图访问中，那里的朋友很自豪地告诉我们：先有波尔图（PORTO），后有葡萄牙（PORTUGAL）。两个名称中前面四个字母相同。波尔图的意思是港口，后来的波图加尔即葡萄牙，显然是由古老的港口城市演变而来。传到远方的中国，就成为“蒲都利加”，相当接近现在的称呼了。这次访问，对我来说，葡萄牙的人文景物，都变得具体生动了。它再也不是《明实录》上的“佛郎机”或“蒲都利加”。
    巴黎协定开辟的中葡新关系，就要跨进第二个10年了。过去10年政治、经济、文化等领域的合作，给双方带来了实在的利益和荣誉，各自有充分理由感到满意。澳门问题联合声明签署以来，澳门社会稳定，经济形势很好，事实证明那是一个好的声明，反映了人心之所向。“天时不如地利，地利不如人和”。人和即友谊与合作。坚持这一条，日后必将给双方带来新的利益，新的荣誉。我们热烈地迎接中葡新关系第二个10年的光临。
