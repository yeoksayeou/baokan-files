In recent years, as China's arable land area has been decreasing, many far-sighted individuals have repeatedly called for the protection of arable land. Various news media have continuously criticized the phenomenon of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land, and the state promulgated the Land Management Law two years ago. However, the situation of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land has not shown significant improvement.

In October 1988, we received 34 letters from readers in 12 provinces (autonomous regions) reflecting this problem: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Hubei, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, Henan, Guangxi, Anhui, and Liaoning. We used a letter inquiry method to investigate most of these letters.

	You take, I take, bit by bit, swallowed whole

These letters and replies reflect that the methods of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land are varied. Some exceed their authority in approvals, or approve less but occupy more; some arbitrarily encroach, or seize on a large scale; some even openly buy and sell or rent out land.

In Yizhou Town, Yixian County, Hebei Province, each person has only half a mu of arable land for food. The village sold dozens of mu of arable land to more than 30 households to build private houses. The income from this half mu of land, after paying taxes, public grain, and various fees, still has to bear the taxes and public grain for the dozens of mu of arable land that have been sold. How can farmers live like this?

In Koushan Town, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, each person has only 7 fen of arable land. Without approval from relevant departments, 22 households occupied several hundred meters of fertile land on both sides of a public road to open restaurants. The government of Qiaotou Township, Taizhou County, Jiangsu Province, built a brick kiln and occupied nearly 70 mu of arable land. It is understood that in 1987, 437,000 mu of arable land in Jiangsu Province was occupied, of which 170,000 mu was occupied without approval.

	Leaders lead the way, creating public nuisances

These letters and replies reflect a noteworthy problem: the situation of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land by grassroots cadres is relatively prominent. Especially in large-scale illegal occupation of arable land incidents, it is often the cadres who lead the way, with the masses following suit.

In Annang Village, Nandang Township, Yicheng County, Hubei Province, the Party branch secretary, Zhu Xiuben, originally had a house with an area of 253 square meters. He privately built a small villa on a fertile vegetable field, covering 757 square meters, citing the original house as too narrow. Because he led the way in violating regulations to occupy land, some villagers followed suit. In more than a year, this village had 9 households of farmers building private houses without approval.

In Longshan Village, Wozhen Town, Pingtan County, Fujian Province, there are more than 1,000 people, but only 266 mu of arable land and a piece of woodland. In July 1988, more than 50 county and town cadres, including Lin Wanli, deputy director of the county land management bureau, destroyed forests and occupied land in Longshan Village, seizing more than 50 plots of land. Lin Wanli already had a house in Gangcheng Township of the same county but still occupied 130 square meters of land in Xibao Village, Chengguan Town, and had laid the foundation stones for the house. Now he has built a two-story villa in Longshan Village, covering 600 square meters. The other more than 50 cadres who occupied land also originally had houses, and some even had two or three houses.

The land management bureau of Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, once investigated the relevant illegal land occupation cases in Yongjia County and found that among the people who illegally occupied land, there were many leading cadres. For example, 9 section-level and bureau-level cadres in the county government and 8 Party committee members in Shangtang Town all had problems with illegal land occupation. More seriously, some of these cadres had multiple land occupations and repeated house building.

	Knowing the law but breaking it, fearless

Previously, people often blamed the lack of corresponding legal regulations for the problem of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land. However, the Land Management Law has been implemented for two years. Why are there still so many incidents of illegal occupation of arable land? This is a question worth considering and paying attention to.

It is understood that the propaganda of the Land Management Law by relevant departments, whether in terms of the speed of dissemination or the scope of dissemination, has exceeded the propaganda of some laws in the past. In these letters reflecting the problem of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land, almost all letter writers quoted specific clauses from the Land Management Law, and the vast majority of letter writers are ordinary farmers. It can be seen that the key to the problem of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land lies in the fact that some people know the law but break it.

Some grassroots leading cadres dare to know the law but break it, which is related to the fact that law enforcement is not strict, and the obstacles to law enforcement often come from outside the land management departments. Chen Yongxin, deputy mayor of Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, bought 82.55 square meters of land in Qinghuibu in the name of his father. After the county agricultural bureau made the decision to "demolish the foundation and return the land," the Qinghuibu Town government arbitrarily changed the decision to a fine of 240 yuan.

According to the relevant provisions of the Land Management Law, state functionaries involved in illegal land occupation cases should be subject to administrative sanctions. However, some illegal cadres have not been subject to administrative sanctions, and the land management department is powerless because the power of administrative sanctions lies with the superior departments of the parties concerned.

In addition, several of our letter inquiries have not been replied to so far. For example, relevant personnel reflected that Zhang Chunfang, the Party branch secretary of Xiangzhuangzi in Xicheng District, Dingzhou City, Hebei Province, sold 150 mu of arable land, and the buyers included 217 people, including the head of the organizational department of Dingzhou City Committee; Li Bingzhao, the Party branch secretary, and Wu Jinwang, the village head of Xichengzhuang Village, Chengguan Town, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, arbitrarily expropriated more than 200 mu of land, etc.

We hope that relevant departments can provide a response.

### 对十二省区读者来信的函调表明  乱占滥用耕地情况严重

　　对十二省区读者来信的函调表明    
    乱占滥用耕地情况严重
    近年来，针对我国耕地面积减少的趋势，许多有识之士一再呼吁保护耕地，各种新闻媒介不断批评乱占滥用耕地的现象，国家也于两年前颁布了土地管理法，但是乱占滥用耕地的情况仍无明显好转。
    １９８８年１０月，我们收到江苏、浙江、山西、湖北、福建、山东、河北、湖南、河南、广西、安徽、辽宁１２个省（自治区）反映这一问题的读者来信３４封，我们采用函调的方法，对其中的大多数信件作了了解。
    　　　　你占我占　蚕食鲸吞
    这些来信和回函反映出，乱占滥用耕地的手段五花八门。有的越权审批，或少批多占；有的肆意蚕食，或大规模抢占；有的还公开买卖、出租。
    河北易县易洲镇东市村人均半亩口粮田，村里还把几十亩耕地卖给３０多户农民建私房。这半亩田的收入除了要交税款、公粮和各种费用外，还要承担已经卖掉的几十亩耕地的税款和公粮。这样下去，农民怎样生活？
    江苏泰兴县口岸镇人均７分耕地，未经有关部门审批，２２家农民占用了几百米公路两侧的良田开饭店。江苏泰县桥头乡政府建砖窑，便占用耕地近７０亩。据了解，１９８７年，江苏省耕地被占用４３．７万亩，其中未经批准和占用的为１７万亩。
    　　　　干部带头　酿成公害
    这些来信和回函中，反映出一个值得注意的问题：基层干部乱占滥用耕地的情况较为突出。尤其是在那些大规模的乱占耕地事件中，往往是干部率先，群众效仿。
    湖北宜城县南党乡安垴村党支部书记朱秀本，原有一处住宅，面积为２５３平方米。他以窄小为由，私自在一块肥沃的菜田里盖了一座小楼，占地７５７平方米。由于他带头违反规定占地，一些村民争相效仿。一年多的时间里，这个村就有９户农民不经批准，盖了私房。
    福建平潭县沃前镇龙山村有１０００多人，但只有耕地２６６亩和一片林地。１９８８年７月，县土地管理局副局长林万里等５０多名县、镇干部在龙山村毁林占地，占了５０多处房基地。林万里在本县岗城乡已有住房，还在本县城关镇西宝庄占地１３０平方米，并已砌了房基石，现又在龙山村盖了一栋二层小楼，占地６００平方米。其他５０多名占地的干部原先也都有住房，有的甚至有两三处住房。
    浙江温州市土地管理局曾对永嘉县有关违法占地的事件作过调查，发现乱占土地的人中，有不少是领导干部。如县机关９名科局级干部、上塘镇８名党委成员，都有违法占地的问题。更为严重的是，其中少数干部属多处占地，重复建房。
    　　　　知法犯法　无所顾忌
    以往，人们对乱占滥用耕地的问题，往往归咎于没有相应的法律规范。可是，土地管理法已经实施两年了，为什么仍有这么多乱占耕地的事件发生呢？这是一个值得思考和重视的问题。
    据了解，有关部门对土地管理法的宣传，无论从传播的速度还是传播的范围来说，都超过了以往对一些法律的宣传。在这些反映乱占滥用耕地问题的来信中，几乎所有的来信人都引用了土地管理法中的具体条款，而来信者绝大多数是普通农民。可见，乱占滥用耕地问题的关键，还在于一些人知法犯法。
    一些基层领导干部之所以敢知法犯法，同执法不严有关，而执法的阻力往往来自土地管理部门之外。浙江永嘉县副县长陈用欣以他父亲的名义，在清水埠买了８２．５５平方米房基地。县农业局作出“拆基还田，退回土地”的决定后，清水埠镇政府却擅自把决定改为处以２４０元的罚款。
    按照土地管理法的有关规定，对违法占地事件中的国家工作人员应给予行政处分，但是一些违法干部并没有受到行政处分，土地管理部门对此无能为力，因为行政处分的权力在当事人的上级主管部门。
    此外，我们发出的几份函调至今没有回复。例如，有关人员反映河北定州市西城区扬庄子党支部书记张春芳出卖耕地１５０亩，买地者有定州市委组织部部长等２１７人；山西襄垣县城关镇西城庄村党支部书记李丙兆，村长武金旺擅自征用土地２００多亩，等等。
    我们希望有关部门能给予答复。
