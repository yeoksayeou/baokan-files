In 1988, our county experienced 311 incidents of damage and theft of rural power equipment. Among the stolen electrical equipment, the most numerous were aluminum wires. On November 26, during winter irrigation in Liangjiazhuang Village, Yujiazhuang Township, over 1,000 meters of power transmission aluminum wires were stolen, causing the entire village's power lines to immediately fail. More than 500 acres of wheat fields that urgently needed winter irrigation could only look at the water in vain. This situation is common throughout the rural areas of our county.

　　蓬莱农村电力设备破坏严重
    １９８８年，我县发生３１１起破坏和盗窃农村电力设备的案件。被盗窃的农电设备中，数量最大的是铝线。１１月２６日，于家庄乡梁家庄村正在冬灌时，输电铝线被盗割１０００多米，全村农电线路立即瘫痪，５００多亩急需冬灌的麦田只能望水兴叹。这一情况在我县农村普遍存在。　　　山东蓬莱　梁军新
