In March 1988, I was invited by the "International Artists Exchange Program" in Basel, Switzerland, to participate in an art exchange. At the same time, Switzerland also sent a painter to Beijing. This mutual exchange of artists was the first of its kind between China and Switzerland.

In May, my solo exhibition opened in Basel. Unfortunately, the newspaper reporting the event that day made a mistake, printing "18:00 start" as "18:00 end." As a result, many visitors arrived early, saw the paintings, and left before the opening. The host feared there would be a "cold scene." However, to everyone's surprise, the opening was more grand and lively than any other exhibition held there. Swiss artists, art lovers, scholars, professors, businessmen, and even painters from neighboring countries filled the exhibition hall. After brief speeches, they enthusiastically appreciated the works, saying many words of praise. I knew this was not flattery. Before coming to Switzerland, they did not know me, so there was no need to flatter me. I also knew that they knew almost nothing about Chinese painting and had few opportunities to appreciate it. This time, they came out of curiosity. In the end, they were not disappointed. They saw an ancient, mysterious, and yet vibrant Eastern art that was completely different from European painting. An unfamiliar genre could still resonate with their souls, and they were intoxicated by the free-flowing ink on Chinese paper. All this was not because of me, but because of "Chinese painting."

I was proud to be a Chinese and a Chinese painter. The students who helped me prepare for the exhibition were excitedly calling this exhibition a "victory for the Chinese people!"

The next day, I called my wife in Beijing to tell her about all this.

She, in turn, told me a story:

The Swiss female painter who "exchanged" with me and her daughter and grandson visited our home. Afterwards, my wife accompanied them to Wangfujing Street for sightseeing. The 5-year-old Swiss boy was thirsty, and my wife wanted to buy him cola, but he said, "I don't want Chinese cola; I want to go to the Beijing Hotel to buy American cola." My wife then let him be!

"A foreign child looks down on China like this!" she angrily told me over the phone.

International long-distance calls are expensive, and I had to pay for them myself. The timer on the phone was ticking, but I quietly listened as she finished telling this not-so-short story, regardless of how many Swiss francs I had to pay!

That night, I couldn't sleep for a long time. The stark contrast between "Chinese painting" and "Chinese cola" kept me restless.

"Going global" is now the loudest slogan among Chinese people. But how do we "go"? Buying large amounts of foreign luxury cars, TVs, and refrigerators with foreign exchange does not necessarily make us "global citizens." Borrowing a foreign brand to make something and exporting it in large quantities does not necessarily mean "entering the international market." Foreigners know exactly how strong China's economy is, and even a young foreign child already has this "mental set." In recent years, it is China's culture and art that have first stepped out of the country and made foreigners take notice. Films, theater, literature, and fine arts are all examples. They dare to look down on your "cola," but they do not dare to look down on your art. The "red sorghum" growing on the "yellow earth" makes the blondes and blue-eyed people take a step back: the Chinese really have some skills!

I talked with my foreign counterparts, and their interest in Chinese painting was so intense that it moved me. They also envied Chinese artists for having stable jobs and basic incomes, unlike them who "live off the land." Unfortunately, what they appreciate is precisely what we want to "change." There are always some people in the country who think it is not "worth it" for the state to "support" a group of artists, considering them a "burden," always wanting them to "seek their own livelihood" and "self-sufficient," using commercial enterprise methods to create "art." Little do they know that these few artists play an irreplaceable role in building "spiritual civilization" at home and enhancing China's international prestige abroad, worth more than tons of "cola"!

China has a 5,000-year "civilization" tradition and is very eager to join the ranks of modern "civilized" countries. So, let's be "civilized"!

　　中国画与中国可乐
　　王为政
    １９８８年３月，我应瑞士巴塞尔“国际艺术家交流计划”之邀，前往进行艺术交流，同时，瑞士也派一位画家来北京，这种互派画家的交流形式，在中瑞之间还是第一次。
    ５月，我的个人画展在巴塞尔开幕。很不凑巧，当天的报纸在报道这一消息时忙中出错，把开幕式“１８：００开始”印成了“１８：００结束”。于是许多观众早早地来了，看过画，不等开幕便走了。主持人担心待会儿要“冷场”。但是出乎预料，开幕式却比以往在这里举行的所有画展都隆重而热烈，瑞士的艺术家和艺术爱好者以及学者、教授、企业家，还有从邻国赶来的画家，把展厅挤得满满的。简短的讲话之后，他们便极有兴致地欣赏作品，说了许多赞美的话。我知道，这不是捧场。在我来瑞士之前，他们根本不认识我，用不着捧我的场。我还知道，他们对中国画几乎一无所知，很少有欣赏的机会，这次是抱着猎奇心理来的。结果，他们没有失望。他们看到了与欧洲绘画迥异的古老、神秘而又有着新的生命力的东方艺术，一个陌生的画种却又能与他们心灵相通，他们为中国宣纸上的淋漓水墨而陶醉。这一切都不是因为我，而是因为“中国画”。
    我为自己作为一个中国人、一位中国画家而自豪。帮助我准备画展的留学生们则兴奋地将这次画展称之为“中国人的胜利！”
    次日，我给在北京的妻子打了个电话，告诉她这一切。
    而她，则给我讲了个故事：
    那位与我“交换”的瑞士女画家和她的女儿、外孙到我家作客，之后，妻子陪他们到王府井大街观光。那个５岁的瑞士小男孩渴了，妻子要给他买可乐，他却说：不要喝中国的可乐，要到北京饭店去买美国的可乐。妻子便撒手不管了！
    “一个外国小孩子都这么看不起中国！”她在电话里愤愤地对我说。
    国际长途电话的费用是昂贵的，而且要我自己负担。电话机上的计时器在跳字，我静静地听着，听她讲完这个并不算短的故事，不管要付多少瑞士法郎了！
    当晚，我久久不能入睡。“中国画”和“中国可乐”如此不同的境遇搅扰得我不得安宁。
    “走向世界”，如今是中国人叫得最响的口号。但怎么“走”呢？抛出大笔外汇购进外国豪华型汽车、彩电、冰箱，未见得就能成为“世界公民”。借个洋字号造点儿什么，“薄利多销”地往外送，也未见得就等于“打入国际市场”。中国的经济实力如何，外国人了如指掌，连一个乳臭未干的黄发小儿也已经具备了这种“思维定势”。近年来，倒是中国的文化艺术率先迈出了国门，并且让洋人刮目相看，电影、戏剧、文学、美术都不乏其例。人家敢于小看你的“可乐”，却不敢小看你的艺术。“黄土地”上长出的“红高粱”让金发碧眼们一愣：中国人还真有两下子！
    我和外国同行交谈，他们对中国绘画兴趣之浓厚，令我感动。他们并且羡慕中国的艺术家有固定的职业和基本收入，不像他们“靠天吃饭”，挺新鲜。可惜，他们欣赏的，正是我们要“改”掉的。国内总有那么一些人，觉得国家花钱“养活”一批艺术家不“合算”，是个“包袱”，总想让他们“自谋出路”、“自负盈亏”，用工商企业的办法去制造“艺术”。岂不知，这些为数不多的艺术家为在国内“建设精神文明”、在国外提高中国的国际威望，发挥了用钱买不来的作用，抵得上多少万吨“可乐”！
    中国有五千年“文明”传统，并且非常想跻身于现代“文明”国家之列，那就“文明”些吧！
