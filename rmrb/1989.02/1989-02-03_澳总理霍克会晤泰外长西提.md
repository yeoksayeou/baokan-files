Australian Prime Minister Hawke, who is visiting Thailand, met with Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi in Bangkok on the 2nd and exchanged views on issues such as Cambodia.

After the meeting, Siddhi responded to reporters' questions, saying that during the meeting, the two sides also discussed the issue of the expanded meeting after the Jakarta informal meeting on the Cambodian issue and the issue of establishing an international supervisory body to resolve the Cambodian issue. However, Siddhi said, "It is still unknown which countries will participate, and what their responsibilities and roles will be."

Siddhi also introduced Hawke's views. Hawke believes that, given the increasingly easing stance of the major powers, "even if the second Jakarta informal talks do not achieve complete success, some results will be achieved."

　　澳总理霍克会晤泰外长西提
    正在泰国访问的澳大利亚总理霍克，二日在曼谷同泰国外长西提进行会晤，并围绕柬埔寨等问题交换了意见。
    西提在会见后回答记者提问时说，双方在会晤时还谈到了关于柬埔寨问题的雅加达非正式会议之后的扩大会议问题以及为解决柬埔寨问题组织国际监督机构的问题。但是西提说，现在“还不知道将有哪些国家参加，也不知其职责和作用是什么。”
    西提还介绍了霍克的看法，霍克认为，鉴于大国的立场正越来越缓解，“即使第二次雅加达非正式会谈不能取得完全的成功，也会取得一定的成果。”
