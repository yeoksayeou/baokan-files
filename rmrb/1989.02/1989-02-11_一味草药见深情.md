A Single Herb Reflects Deep Affection

My daughter, within her first year, suffered from a severe cold and was injected with four doses of gentamicin, resulting in deafness. Despite prolonged treatment, there was no improvement. Recently, I came across a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that can treat deafness caused by medication. However, one of the herbs in the prescription is very difficult to obtain.

After consulting relevant books, I learned that this herb is produced in Sichuan. I then wrote letters to both the Sichuan Daily and the Sichuan Chinese Medicinal Materials Company seeking help. Half a month later, I received replies from both. I learned that after receiving my letter, the Sichuan Daily immediately contacted the Chengdu Chinese Medicinal Materials Company; the Sichuan Chinese Medicinal Materials Company, not having the herb, also dispatched someone to contact the Chengdu Chinese Medicinal Materials Company. Soon after, the Business Department of the Chengdu Chinese Medicinal Materials Company sent me the herb.

I only spent 3.93 yuan to purchase this herb, but within this price is the deep affection of the relevant comrades from the Sichuan Daily, the Sichuan Chinese Medicinal Materials Company, and the Chengdu Chinese Medicinal Materials Company!

　　一味草药见深情
    我女儿在周岁内，因患重感冒，注射了４支庆大霉素，造成了耳聋，而且久治无效。最近，我看到一个中药方，能治由用药引起的耳聋，可其中一味中草药十分难买。
    经查阅有关书籍，我得知这味中草药产地在四川。我便给四川日报社和四川中药材公司同时写信求援。半个月后，我先后收到了他们的来信，得知四川日报社接到我信后，立即与成都市中药材公司联系；四川中药材公司因无此药，也派人与成都市中药材公司联系。不久，成都市中药材公司业务科给我寄来了这味中草药。
    我买这味药只花了３．９３元，但是，这里面饱含着四川日报社、四川中药材公司和成都市中药材公司有关同志的深情厚意！ 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　内蒙古包头市二冶筑炉
