Twelve precious Tang Dynasty stone carvings were recently unearthed in Huguang County, Shanxi Province. Two of the statues are of Buddhas seated on lotus-shaped pedestals with their hands resting on their laps. One is a statue of Manjushri Bodhisattva seated on a lion-shaped pedestal with a lotus flower. The rest are of the triad style, featuring one Buddha flanked by two Bodhisattvas. These statues have full faces, high arched eyebrows, ears that reach the shoulders, and a dignified demeanor, all characteristic of the Tang Dynasty style.
