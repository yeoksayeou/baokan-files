	Future society will need five types of talent. The most authoritative futurists in the United States and West Germany have pointed out that in the next 20 years, the most needed talents, in order, are:

	Computer programmers. As computers and robots become more widely used in people's lives, there will be a great demand for programmers who can write computer programs.

	Next are health technicians. With the advancement of science and technology and the improvement of people's health, there is an increasing demand for health technicians.

	Third are engineers who can manufacture robots. Various countries will use robots extensively in production to reduce costs and increase output.

	Fourth are jet and energy technicians. The applications of jets will be as widespread as transistors. Energy technicians will be involved in energy measurement, circulation, and demand forecasting, as well as finding new energy sources.

　　未来需要五种人才
    美国和西德最有权威的未来学家撰文指出：未来２０年前后最需要的人才依次是：电脑程序师。由于电脑和机器人更广泛地进入人们的生活，需要大量能编制电脑程序的程序设计师。
    其次是健康技师。由于科技水平和人们健康水平的提高，人们都希望健康长寿，因而对健康技师的需求量增加。
    第三位是制造机器人的工程师。各国将在生产中大量使用机器人，以便降低成本，增加产量。
    第四位的是射流和能源技师。射流的用途将和晶体管一样广泛。能源技师将从事能源计量、循环和需求预测等工作，还要寻找新的动力资源。
    第五位是废物处理工程师和基因工程师。
