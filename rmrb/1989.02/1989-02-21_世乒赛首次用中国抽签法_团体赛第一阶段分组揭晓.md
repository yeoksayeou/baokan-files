ITTF President Ichiro Uchiyama and others attended the draw ceremony. Cheng Jianyang told our reporter that this is the first time the World Championships have adopted China's "self-service card" drawing method, with the aim of increasing scientificity and trust. Yesterday, he randomly invited reporters, staff, and ITTF personnel present to draw. Our reporter was also fortunate to participate in the women's team draw, resulting in the Netherlands Antilles and El Salvador being placed in groups F and G. It is reported that the draw for the 5 championships will be held on the eve of the competition opening. The championships are scheduled to open on March 29th and close on April 9th.
