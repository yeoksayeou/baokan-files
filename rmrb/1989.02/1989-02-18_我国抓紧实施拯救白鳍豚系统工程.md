The baiji dolphin, listed by the World Wildlife Fund as one of the 10 endangered species in China that are on the verge of extinction, is currently undergoing systematic protection efforts including in-situ conservation, relocation protection, and artificial breeding.

It is understood that in the section of the Yangtze River where the baiji dolphin population is approximately one-quarter of the total, the Hubei Provincial Government has approved the establishment of a baiji dolphin nature reserve.

The Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is currently constructing a modern aquarium in Wuhan City to conduct artificial breeding experiments and research.

    被世界野生动物组织列为我国近期行将灭绝的１０种珍稀动物之一的白鳍豚，就地保护、迁移保护和人工繁殖等系统工程，目前正在抓紧实施。
    据了解，在白鳍豚分布总量约占１／４的长江洪湖江段，经湖北省政府批准设立了一个白鳍豚自然保护区。
    中国科学院水生生物研究所，正在武汉市修建一座现代化的白鳍豚水族馆，用以开展人工繁殖实验研究。
