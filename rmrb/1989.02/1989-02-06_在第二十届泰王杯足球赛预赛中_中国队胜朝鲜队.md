　　中国队胜朝鲜队
    新华社曼谷２月４日电  （记者黄勇）中国队今晚在这里进行的第２０届泰王杯足球赛预赛中，以３∶１战胜朝鲜民主主义人民共和国队。
    朝鲜队攻防转换快，进攻凶猛，队员渗透意识强，在上半时比赛中给中国队的后防造成了一定困难。第２６分钟时，朝鲜队从边路发起进攻，中路包抄队员接球后射门得分。中国队的反击也多次给对方造成威胁，但由于对手逼得太紧而未能得分。上半时比赛结束前１分钟时，中国队在前场获得一次任意球机会。后卫范志毅接球后猛射破网，将比分扳平。
    下半时比赛，中国队加强了进攻。第２３分钟时，中国队利用角球机会，由二号范志毅再添一分。３分钟后，中国队反击成功又下一城。
    在今晚进行的另一场比赛中，丹麦队以２∶０战胜泰国Ｂ队。
    至此，在Ａ组中泰国Ａ队和南朝鲜队均为３战３胜积６分，小组出线已成定局。Ｂ组的苏联队３战１胜２平积４分，丹麦队３战２胜１平积５分，中国队３战２胜１平积５分。６日晚，苏联队将与泰国Ｂ队交锋，中国队与丹麦队对阵。
