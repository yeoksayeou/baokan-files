Title: Cherish Our Language and Script

In some places, in television and radio news, people often encounter phenomena of linguistic chaos and illogical writing. Here are a few examples, not very typical:

This match was “both thrilling and a feast for the eyes.”

Anyone can be elected to ××, “with no distinction between high and low positions, seniority, or age.”

“We need to take necessary measures.”

The word “conduct” is overused. Whenever there is an opportunity, it’s “conduct.” However, “conducting a cleanup of those who illegally trade scrap metal in the city” is obviously not as simple and clear as “cleaning up those who illegally trade scrap metal in the city.” “It is necessary to conduct a large-scale reduction” is not as forceful as “it is necessary to reduce on a large scale.”

Additionally, colloquial language is pursuing written language expressions. Terms like “the said company,” “this factory,” and words such as “all,” “still,” “the,” and “his” which are usually used in written language, frequently appear in broadcasts. “This is the first time” has been heard countless times. There was even such an expression: “At that time, it will be announced separately.” It is hard not to laugh. I doubt our illiterate compatriots can adapt to this trend of “elegance” in colloquial language.

Colloquial language has a tendency towards written language, while written language has a tendency towards classical and Westernized styles. Moreover, the lower the level of the publication, the more pronounced this tendency. “Putting on airs to intimidate people.” Many comrades have thoroughly analyzed this. I just want to reiterate one point: for the purity and health of our national language, I hope our authors use standard language and regard this as a social responsibility; rather than deliberately pursuing obscurity, or collecting fashionable vocabulary from translations to create seemingly profound but actually empty articles.

From language, I think of characters. Many products like shirts, pants, and bags have labels written in Pinyin or foreign languages, seemingly in a “foreign exchange earning” style (“earning foreign exchange” has to be like this?). There is a type of baby clothing where the Chinese label “happiness” is hidden under the collar, while the front displays three large letters: “USA.” I also heard my daughter say that there is a type of celebrity calendar where the signatures are all written in cursive Pinyin.

I do not oppose the use of Pinyin or even the use of foreign languages in design. What I fear is that this trend reflects a mentality: using Pinyin that looks like foreign language for labels to be close to foreign goods; using cursive Pinyin for signatures, as if one has completely shed the “rustic” air.

It is a fact that we lag behind in many aspects, but our characters do not lag behind. Square characters are an excellent chapter in Chinese culture. The only script that can give birth to a unique art—calligraphy—is Chinese characters. More importantly, it is ancient yet full of vitality, showing amazing adaptability in the process of technological leaps.

During my time working abroad, I heard many foreigners sincerely praise the wonders of Chinese characters, enthusiastically talking about our many dialects and “unified script.” Chinese characters have also entered the field of design abroad. I once took a photo with a little boy, and the pattern on his shirt was composed of cursive Chinese characters. I saw a young woman whose loose sweater had three elegant Chinese characters: “grow tall,” each character being 20 centimeters high. It can be seen that foreigners regard Chinese characters as a kind of art. Even when it comes to labels or design patterns, Chinese characters have true, grass, seal, and clerical scripts, providing a broader scope than Pinyin. If we do not explore in this direction but are keen on using Pinyin, and even lack the courage to use square characters, it may reflect a weak sense of national self-love.

It seems necessary to appeal: increase a sense of self-love, correctly use our language; eliminate inferiority complex, boldly use our square characters. The foundation of the Four Modernizations lies in invigorating the national spirit. We might as well start by cherishing our national language and script.

### 爱护我们的语言和文字

　　爱护我们的语言和文字
    马为民
    在我们有些地方电视、广播的新闻中，人们经常可以发现一些语言混乱与文理不通的现象。随手记下几例，不算典型：
    这场比赛“既扣人心弦，又令人大饱眼福”。
    任何人均可当选××，“没有职位高低、资历深浅、年龄大小的差别”。
    对于……“我们有必要采取必要措施”。
    “进行”一词用滥了，动不动就“进行”。然而，“对于在本市进行非法倒卖废金属的人进行了清查”，显然不如“清查了在本市非法倒卖废金属的人”简单明确。“对……必须进行大规模的削减”，哪有“必须大规模削减……”铿锵有力？
    另外，口语在追求书面语言的说法。“该公司”、“此工厂”以及“均”、“尚”、“之”、“其”等通常用于书面的副词和代词，在广播中经常出现。“尚属首次”，听过不知多少次了。还出现过这样的说法：“届时，将另行公布”。令人忍俊不禁。我怀疑我们的文盲同胞能适应这种口语“雅化”的趋向。
    口语有书面语言化的倾向，而书面语言的文言化和欧化倾向又日益严重。而且，越是层次低的出版物，这类倾向就越盛。“装腔作势，藉以吓人”。许多同志对此作过周到的分析。只想重复一点：为了祖国语言的纯洁和健康，希望我们的作者都使用规范的语言，并把这当作一种社会责任；而不去刻意追求艰涩、或搜罗译著中的时髦词汇，以炮制貌似博大高深、实则空洞无物的花架子文章。
    从语言又想到文字。上衣、裤子、提包等许多商品的商标用的是拼音汉字或外文，俨然是一副“创汇”的派头（“创汇”就非得这样吗？）。有一种婴儿装，汉字商标“快乐”躲在领口下面，胸前则是赫然三个大写字母：“ＵＳＡ”。又听小女说，有一种影星挂历，上面的签名全是用“飞体”书写的拼音。
    我不反对使用拼音汉字，甚至不反对在美工中用外文。怕的是这股风反映着这样一种心态：用貌似洋文的拼音做商标，跟洋货攀近乎；用“飞体”拼音汉字签名，似乎自己就彻底抖掉了“土气”。
    我们在许多方面落后是事实，但汉字并不落后。方块汉字是中华文化中优秀的篇章。唯一能够派生出一门独特的艺术——书法的文字就是汉字。更可贵的是，它古老而充满活力，在科技飞跃发展的过程中表现出惊人的适应性。
    在国外工作期间，我听到过许多外国人由衷地称赞汉字的美妙神奇，津津乐道我们的方言多而“书同文”。汉字在国外也进入了美工设计领域。我跟一个小男孩合过影，他的上衣的图案是龙飞凤舞的草体汉字组成的。我见过一位女青年，她的宽松的套头衫上印着三个秀丽的汉字：“长大高”，每个字都有２０厘米高。可见，外国人是把汉字当作一种艺术看待的。即使说到商标或图案设计，汉字有真草隶篆诸体，比拼音文字有更广阔的天地。不朝这个方向去开拓，而热衷于用拼音，甚至缺乏勇气用方块字，恐怕是民族自爱心薄弱的一种反映。
    看来，似有必要呼吁：增长点自爱心，正确使用我们的语言；扫除掉自卑感，大胆使用我们的方块字。实现四化之本在于振奋民族精神，我们不妨从爱护祖国的语言和文字做起。
