	Anonymous Remittances for Six Years: Quietly Assisting the Elderly

	In 1981, Wuqiao Market worker Cai Qiu Lin passed away due to illness. His elderly and ailing mother, who lived in the countryside, and his blind father faced difficulties in their lives. Market worker Yuan Zhengxing learned about this and discussed with his wife the matter of assisting Cai Qiu Lin's parents. His wife readily agreed. At that time, Yuan Zhengxing and his wife had a total monthly income of only 70-plus yuan, and they also had to raise a son. They squeezed out 10 yuan from their meager income each month and sent it to Cai Qiu Lin's parents in the name of Wuqiao Market. During festivals and holidays, they would send an additional few dozen yuan. Cai Qiu Lin's parents always thought that the money was sent by Wuqiao Market.

	In September 1988, Yuan Zhengxing was on a business trip to Zhejiang and Shandong provinces and failed to send the money to Cai Qiu Lin's parents on time. Cai Qiu Lin's parents thought that the market had forgotten to send the money and asked someone to inquire at Wuqiao Market, leaving the market's responsible person puzzled. A month later, Cai Qiu Lin's parents received a remittance of 50 yuan from Wuqiao Market. They took the remittance slip and, through relevant departments, found out that the money was sent by Yuan Zhengxing.

	The honest and simple Yuan Zhengxing is 40 years old this year and is a refrigeration machine repairman at Wuqiao Market. He has been repeatedly named an advanced worker of Wuxi City Vegetable Company.

　　六年匿名寄款  悄然资助老人
    我市吴桥菜场职工蔡秋林１９８１年因病去世时，他那住在乡下年迈多病的母亲和双目失明的父亲的生活发生了困难。菜场职工袁正兴知道后，便与妻子商量接济蔡秋林父母的事。他妻子爽快地同意了。那时，袁正兴夫妻每月的收入总共才７０多元，还要抚养一个儿子。他们每月从微薄的收入中挤出１０元钱，以吴桥菜场的名义按时寄给蔡秋林的父母，逢年过节还要多寄去几十元。蔡秋林的父母一直以为这钱是吴桥菜场寄给的。
    １９８８年９月，袁正兴因到浙江、山东等地出差而没有按时给蔡秋林的父母寄钱。蔡秋林的父母以为菜场漏寄了钱，便托人到吴桥菜场询问，弄得菜场负责人不知道怎么回事。一个月后，蔡秋林的父母又收到署名吴桥菜场寄来的５０元汇款。他们拿着汇款单，通过有关部门才查到这款是袁正兴寄的。
    憨厚朴实的袁正兴今年４０岁，是吴桥菜场的冷冻机修理工，多次被评为无锡市蔬菜公司的先进工作者。
