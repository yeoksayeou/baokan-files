The People's Daily reports that Mudanjiang City in Heilongjiang Province has taken various measures to address the significant funding gap in its primary and secondary schools, creating favorable conditions for the development of education.

In the past two years, the city's leaders have conducted multiple inspections of schools and held special meetings to comprehensively discuss the development of education, making corresponding decisions:

- Increase the education surcharge rate. Starting from January 1, 1989, the education surcharge rate in the entire city will be raised from 1% to 2%.

- For the additional fees collected from social groups purchasing controlled commodities, at least 50% will be allocated to education. The municipal finance department will return all the budgetary funds collected from the education department to education.

- Establish an education foundation. For individuals who make significant contributions, schools can be named after them, and their children will receive preferential treatment in terms of admission and employment.

- The various fee regulations issued by the municipal government, if they involve primary and secondary schools, will be reduced or exempted by the relevant departments.

- Establish a fund for part-time work and study, and implement the advance allocation of educational funds. The taxes collected from industrial enterprises run by primary and secondary schools will be fully returned by the financial department when arranging the next year's budget expenditure, and the education department will allocate and use them.

- Improve the method of collecting 2% of the investment in urban housing construction for the construction of teachers' housing, and have the Municipal Urban Construction Comprehensive Development Office collect it. No one is allowed to open any exemptions. When the spouse's unit allocates housing, the spouse of a teacher should be given priority in the same conditions.

- To encourage teachers to dedicate their lives to the education cause, retired primary and secondary school teachers who have taught for more than 30 years will continue to receive 100% of their retirement salary.

　　牡丹江采取特殊措施扶持教育事业
    本报讯  黑龙江牡丹江市针对中小学经费缺口较大的实际，采取多种渠道筹措经费，为发展教育创造良好的条件。
    近两年来，这个市的领导多次到学校调查，并召开专门会议，全面研讨教育发展，做出相应决定：
    ——提高教育费附加征收比例。从１９８９年１月１日开始，全市的教育费附加由１％提高到２％。
    ——对社会集团购置专控商品征收的附加费专项用于教育事业的部分不低于５０％，市财政从教育部门分成筹集的预算外资金全部返还教育。
    ——建立教育基金会。对贡献卓著者，可用个人名义命名学校，对其子女在升学、就业等方面给予照顾。
    ——市政府制定的各项收费规定，凡涉及中小学的，有关部门执行时给予减免。
    ——建立勤工俭学周转金，实行教育经费提前预拨。对中小学校办工业企业所征收的税金，财政部门在安排下年预算支出时，全部返回，由教育部门统筹安排使用。
    ——改进在城市住宅建设投资中提取２％用于中小学教师住房建设的征集办法，由市城市建设综合开发办公室代征，任何人不得开减免口子。教师配偶所在单位分配住房时，在同等条件下要优先分配给教师配偶住房。
    ——为鼓励教师终身从事教育事业，对从教３０年以上的中小学教师，退休后工资１００％照发。
