	New Swallows

	The newly married swallows
	Have eyes filled with
	The music of spring blossoms
	Though still dressed in purple-black attire
	Their demeanor is much more modern
	Each feather
	Combed towards joy
	Perched on a branch, they make the buds
	Realize: Spring is at hand
	They make the unforgettable landscapes emerge from whispers
	Fresh and vibrant
	Full of life

	Warm Apricot Blossoms

	There is no gray time in budding
	Each petal of thought
	Opens warmly
	Like the blush on my cheeks
	Borrowed by you
	The hum of life
	Buzzes around in bee-like chatter
	Even if it does not go out of the wall
	It will quietly gaze at your branches in the clear sky

　　春在眉睫（二首）
　　华万里
    新燕
    新婚归来的燕子
    两眼录满
    春暖花开的音乐
    虽然仍穿着紫黑的衣裳
    但气派却现代得多了
    每一片羽毛
    都梳向欢乐
    停在枝上，使朵朵蓓蕾
    觉察到：春在眉睫
    使过目难忘的山水走出呢喃
    神韵鲜嫩
    意态活泼
    　　　　暖杏
    没有灰色的时间含苞
    每瓣心事
    暖烘烘地开放
    恰似我颊上的飞红
    被你借去
    嗡嗡的人生
    绕来绕去地作蜂式的谈论
    即使不再出墙
    伊也会在心窗
    悄悄望你的枝枝晴朗
