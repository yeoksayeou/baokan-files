With the arrival of the Spring Festival, the 1989 Beijing International Tourism Promotion Year has begun.

A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Tourism revealed at a press conference on February 3 that although Beijing's tourism industry is developing rapidly, compared to places like Hong Kong and Singapore, there is still a significant gap in terms of the number of tourists received and tourism revenue. One of the main reasons for this is that foreign tourists know very little about Beijing. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen publicity to promote the development of Beijing's tourism industry.

　　北京国际旅游宣传年拉开序幕
    本报讯  记者刘霄报道：随着春节的到来，１９８９北京国际旅游宣传年拉开了序幕。
    北京市旅游局负责人在２月３日的新闻发布会上透露：目前，尽管北京的旅游业发展迅速，但比起香港、新加坡等地，无论接待人数、旅游创汇均有不小的差距，其中一个重要的原因，就是国外游客对北京很不了解。为此，要加强宣传，推动北京旅游业发展。
