The forgery and sale of fake invoices are becoming more prevalent. Relevant departments should take measures to strengthen management.

A report from our correspondent Wang Jinhu: The supply and marketing cooperative of Longhui County in Hunan Province privately sold 15 blank invoices to a villager named Deng for 200 yuan each. Deng used these fake invoices to evade taxes amounting to 320,000 yuan during the transportation of timber. Currently, phenomena such as using invoices for tax evasion, illegal business operations, and violating financial regulations are quite common, and some are quite serious.

During the third and fourth quarters of last year, the tax authorities conducted a nationwide invoice inspection. Out of 7,592,000 taxpaying units that were inspected or self-inspected, 1,133,000 were found to have various problems with their invoice usage and management, accounting for 14.92% of the inspected units. Among these, 210,000 units were fined, and 277,000 units were required to pay back taxes, totaling 170 million yuan in fines and back taxes.

The prominent issues in invoice usage and management include private printing and selling, lending, forging, altering, and using non-standard invoices or blank receipts instead of standard invoices for accounting. In some places, criminal gangs specializing in forging and selling fake invoices have emerged.

　　伪造炒卖假发票愈演愈烈
    有关部门应采取措施加强管理
    本报讯  记者王锦鹄报道：湖南省隆回县供销社将１５份空白发票以每份２００元的价格私自售给村民邓某，邓某在木材贩运中，利用这些假发票偷漏税款３．２万元。目前，像这种利用发票做手脚，偷税漏税、非法经营、违反财务制度的现象相当普遍，有的还十分严重。
    去年三、四季度，税务机关在全国范围内进行了一次发票大检查，经对７５９．２万纳税户重点检查或自查，查出在发票使用和管理中有这样那样问题的达１１３．３万户，占被查户数的１４．９２％，其中２１万户被处以罚款，２７．７万户补税，罚款补税金额共计１．７亿元。
    发票使用和管理中的突出问题，是私印私售、转借代开、涂改伪造以及用非统一发票和白条代替统一发票入帐。有的地方出现了专事伪造、炒卖假发票的犯罪团伙。
