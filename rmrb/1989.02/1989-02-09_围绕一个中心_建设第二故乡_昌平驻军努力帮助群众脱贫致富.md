The military units stationed in Beijing's Changping County love Changping and are dedicated to building it as their second home. They focus on economic development and have won the hearts of the local people. Four units in the county have been named "National Advanced Units for Supporting the Government and Loving the People," and 17 units have been commended by the Beijing municipal government.

The Changping military units leverage their strong technical capabilities, extensive external connections, and timely information to help local residents develop commercial economies. Liu Village Township, a semi-mountainous area lacking in agricultural science and technology and management talent for township enterprises, is relatively poor. The nearby engineering corps unit invited experts and professors from Beijing Agricultural University, their joint construction unit, to hold training classes on fruit tree cultivation, livestock veterinary medicine, enterprise management, planting, breeding, and accounting. They trained 160 agricultural science and technology personnel. During the fruit tree pruning training class, the experts and professors from Beijing Agricultural University demonstrated their skills on the spot. Scientific pruning increased the yield of the township's 3,500 mu of fruit trees from 1.35 million kilograms the previous year to 2.15 million kilograms. Zhang Shihua, a poor resident from Wangyu Village in Gaokou Township, was encouraged and helped by the soldiers of the First Battalion of the Engineering Maintenance Brigade of the General Staff Department to start a tofu shop, pig farm, and convenience store, utilizing his skill in making tofu. Zhang Shihua earned 14,000 yuan that year, becoming the township's "wealth model." The First Battalion promptly helped the village party branch summarize and promote Zhang Shihua's wealth-creation experience, turning 75% of the households in the village into specialized households in pig, cattle, bee, chicken raising, transportation, and commerce. Among them, more than 30 households earned over 5,000 yuan, and 10 households earned over 10,000 yuan.

The Changping military units understand the principle that "without industry, there is no wealth." Therefore, while actively helping local residents develop planting and breeding industries, they also vigorously assist in the development of township enterprises. The Yanfeng Water Tank Factory in Liu Village Township was originally a farm machinery repair factory on the verge of bankruptcy. The soldiers of the engineering corps regiment saw this and felt compelled to act. They said, "Changping is our second home. Helping the Changping people develop production is our duty." They invited Engineer Liu Linpei from the Fourth Institute of Engineering Corps Research to design a new type of pressure water tank for the factory and provided strong support in production management, technical guidance, product sales, and raw material supply. This new type of pressure water tank, which can replace water towers and solve the problem of water supply to high-rise buildings, was highly regarded by relevant departments and included in Beijing's "Spark Program" upon its release. The product was well-received by users nationwide after it hit the market. In 1987, it created a production value of over 500 million yuan, and in the following year, it surpassed 100 million yuan, becoming Changping County's flagship product. The armored forces unit of the General Staff Department is stationed in Xiaodian Village, a poor mountain village that relied on grain returns, production loans, and relief for living. Since 1982, the unit has carried out military-civilian joint construction activities with Xiaodian Village. The unit saw that the village's original dial processing factory had a small production scale and low economic benefits, so they proactively suggested expanding the processing scope of the dial factory and trial-operating a paint factory. They also contacted Beijing Radio Factory and signed a production contract for the painting and processing of radios. The unit promptly provided some equipment and invited technicians to quickly establish the paint factory, earning over 40 million yuan that year. Over the years, the unit has also helped Xiaodian Village establish sand and gravel plants, detergent factories, and other enterprises. In 1982, the per capita income of Xiaodian Village was only 300 yuan, but it reached 1,300 yuan last year, making it one of the advanced units in Beijing's two civilizations construction. Statistics show that in recent years, all military units in the county have helped residents establish 34 township enterprises, with an annual production value of over 270 million yuan.

　　围绕一个中心　建设第二故乡
　　昌平驻军努力帮助群众脱贫致富
    本报讯  北京市昌平县驻军驻昌平，爱昌平，围绕经济建设中心，努力建设第二故乡，深受人民群众的欢迎。全县驻军有４个单位被评为“全国拥政爱民先进单位”，有１７个单位受到北京市政府的表彰。
    昌平驻军充分利用自身技术力量强和对外联系广、信息灵的优势，大力帮助驻地群众发展商品经济。流村乡是个缺乏农业科学技术和乡镇企业管理人才的半山区，比较贫困。驻在附近的工程兵某部就请来共建单位北京农业大学的专家、教授，帮助乡里办了果树栽培、畜牧兽医、企业管理、种植养殖和财会等培训班，共培训各类农科技术人才１６０人。举办果树培训班时，正赶上果树春剪。农大的专家、教授现场传授技艺。科学剪枝，使全乡３５００亩果树的产量从上年的１３５万公斤猛增到２１５万公斤。高口乡王峪村的张士华是个贫困户。总参工程兵维护总队一大队的指战员就鼓励和帮助他发挥会做豆腐的一技之长，办起了豆腐房、养猪场和小卖部，使张士华当年就收入１４０００元，成为全乡的“致富标兵”。一大队及时帮助村党支部总结、推广张士华的致富经验，使全村７５％的人家成为养猪、养牛、养蜂、养鸡和运输、经商等专业户，其中年收入５０００元以上的有３０多户，超过万元的有１０户。
    昌平驻军深知“无工不富”的道理，因此他们在积极帮助驻地群众发展种植、养殖业的同时，大力帮助驻地群众发展乡镇企业。流村乡燕峰水罐厂原来是个濒临倒闭的农机维修厂。工程兵某旅指战员看在眼里，急在心上。他们说：“昌平是我们的第二故乡，帮助昌平群众发展生产是我们义不容辞的责任。”他们请工程兵科研四所的工程师刘林沛为该厂设计了一种新型压力水罐，并在生产管理、技术指导、产品销售和原材料供应等方面给予了大力支持。这种能代替水塔、可解决高层楼房供水难问题的新型压力水罐一经问世，便引起了有关部门的重视，被列入了北京市的“星火计划”。产品投放市场后，深受用户欢迎，畅销全国各地。１９８７年创产值５００多万元，去年突破１０００万，成为昌平县的拳头产品。总参装甲兵某部驻地下店村是个“吃粮靠返销、生产靠贷款、生活靠救济”的穷山村。从１９８２年起，这个部队与下店村开展了军民共建活动。部队见村里原来的表盘加工厂生产规模小，经济效益低，就主动建议村里扩大表盘厂的加工范围，试办喷漆厂，并与北京无线电厂联系，签订了收录机的喷漆加工生产合同。部队不失时机地提供了部分设备，又请来技术员，很快办起了喷漆厂，当年就收入４０多万元。几年来，部队还先后帮助下店村办起了砂石厂、清洗剂厂等企业。１９８２年，下店村人均收入只有３００元，去年达到１３００元，成为北京市两个文明建设的先进单位。据统计，近年来，全县驻军各单位共帮助群众兴办乡镇企业３４个，年创产值达２７００多万元。
