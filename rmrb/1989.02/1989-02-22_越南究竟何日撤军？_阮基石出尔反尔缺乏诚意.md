Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach recently reiterated that Vietnam will delay its complete withdrawal from Cambodia until the end of 1990.

Nguyen Co Thach made this statement on February 19th in Jakarta after the first day of the second informal meeting on the Cambodian issue. He told reporters that if a political solution to the Cambodian problem is reached, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year. However, if no such solution is reached, Vietnam will delay its complete withdrawal until the end of 1990.

Prior to this meeting, Nguyen Co Thach had hinted that even if no agreement on the composition of the future Cambodian government is reached, Vietnam would still withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by midnight on September 30th of this year.

Observers believe that Nguyen Co Thach's flip-flopping attitude indicates that Vietnam is playing tricks on the withdrawal issue and lacks sincerity.

　　越南究竟何日撤军？
    阮基石出尔反尔缺乏诚意
    新华社雅加达２月２０日电  越南外长阮基石１９日在这里重弹越南要拖到１９９０年底才从柬埔寨全部撤军的老调。
    阮基石在关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议第一天会议以后对记者们说，假如柬埔寨问题达成一项政治解决方案，越南将在今年９月底从柬埔寨撤出全部军队；如果达不成这个方案，越南就要拖到１９９０年年底才全部撤军。
    在这次会议召开前夕，阮基石曾经放风说，如果不能就柬未来政府组成问题达成协议，越南也将在今年９月３０日午夜前从柬全部撤军。
    观察家认为，阮基石出尔反尔的态度表明，越南在撤军问题上玩弄花招，缺乏诚意。
