A jobless man in India, who had been unemployed for a long time, was forced to mutilate his own feet in desperation.

This man, named Jihan Xin, is 35 years old and has five children. Since he was laid off by a factory two years ago, he has not found a formal job and has been doing odd jobs to make ends meet. His life has become increasingly difficult. To support the family, his two older sons resorted to theft and were eventually caught. His wife and daughter had to beg on the streets.

Recently, the Indian government implemented a plan to provide vocational training and guaranteed employment for the disabled. Jihan Xin applied, claiming he had difficulty moving his limbs, but his application was rejected. In a fit of anger, he lay down by the railway tracks and extended his feet into the path of an oncoming train. The train driver noticed him too late and was unable to stop in time. The wheels of the moving train crushed his feet to pieces.

After recovering from his injuries, Jihan Xin finally "achieved his goal" and secured a job caring for the disabled. However, many people believe that sacrificing healthy feet for a job is also a tragic tale of human suffering.

　　自毁双脚的失业汉
    印度一位失业多时的男子，苦于长期找不到工作，被迫忍痛自毁双脚。
    这位名叫吉汉·辛的男子现年三十五岁，育有五个儿女。自从两年前他被一家工厂解雇后，就再也没有找到正式职业，一直在外打零工，日子过得一天比一天艰难。为了维持生计，他的两个稍大一点的儿子便铤而走险加入了小偷的行列，不久失手被捕。其妻子和女儿则不得不沿街乞讨。
    最近，印度政府推行了一项包括职业培训和保证受雇的伤残人就业计划，吉汉·辛趁机也以四肢行动不便为由提出申请，结果被有关部门拒之门外。为了弄假成真，他一气之下竟身卧铁路旁，将双脚伸入轨道内，这时，一列火车正疾驶而来，当司机发现吉汉·辛时已经刹车不及，滚动的车轮无情地将他的双脚碾得粉碎。
    吉汉·辛伤愈后，总算“如愿以偿”，获得了一个照顾残疾人谋生的职业，但不少人认为，以失去健全的双脚为代价去换取职业，亦是人间的一出悲剧。
