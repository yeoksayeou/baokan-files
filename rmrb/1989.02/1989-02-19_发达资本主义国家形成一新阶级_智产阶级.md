The knowledge class, also known as the intellectual class, refers to a social group in developed capitalist countries who do not own the means of production but possess knowledge and intelligence, using these as their "capital." They are employed by enterprises and the state, primarily earning a living by selling their intellectual labor in exchange for wages. The knowledge class includes six strata: first, managers; second, technical personnel; third, research scientists; fourth, educators; fifth, government employees; and sixth, freelancers such as journalists, writers, artists, doctors, and lawyers.

Since the 1950s and 1960s, the knowledge class has rapidly formed in various developed capitalist countries. One reason is that the number of people in the knowledge class has rapidly increased, ultimately becoming the largest social group by population. Another reason is that the knowledge class has transitioned from being a dependent, non-independent stratum attached to other classes into an independent class. Their social status has been steadily rising, and their social influence has been growing.

　　发达资本主义国家形成一新阶级——智产阶级
    知产阶级也叫智产阶级。是指在发达资本主义国家中，本身没有生产资料，只有知识和智能，以此作为自己的“资产”，被企业和国家所雇佣，主要靠出卖脑力劳动而领取工资生活的社会集团。知产阶级包括六个阶层，即：一、管理人员，二、技术人员，三、科研人员，四、教育人员，五、国家职员，六、记者、作家、艺术家、医生、律师等自由职业者。
    ５０、６０年代以后，知产阶级所以在各发达资本主义国家迅速形成，一是知产阶级在人数上迅速增加，并最终成为社会上人数最庞大的一个阶级；一是知产阶级已经由过去的没有独立的、依附于其他阶级的阶层变成一个独立的阶级，其社会地位日益提高，其社会作用日益增大。
