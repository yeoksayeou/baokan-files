On November 25, 1988, our province's textile industry bureau allocated over a thousand kilograms of spandex yarn to our factory according to the plan. On November 30, our factory's supply and marketing department head took the allocation notice and retrieved the goods. When the truck passed through Liu Village Township in Shenzhou County, it was stopped by the Liu Village Township Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau, which demanded to see the business license. The supply and marketing department head who accompanied the goods showed his work ID and the accompanying note issued by the provincial textile company. However, the industrial and commercial administration staff said, "No business license, fine of 100 yuan." Despite repeated arguments from our side, we were still fined 50 yuan. Can such a fine be imposed on a passing cargo truck?

　　有这样罚款的吗？
    一九八八年十一月二十五日，我省纺织工业总公司按计划调拨给我厂一千多公斤锦纶弹力丝。十一月三十日，我厂供销科长持调拨单将货提回。当汽车经过深泽县留村乡时，被留村乡工商管理所挡住，责令交验营业执照。随行的我厂供销科长出示了工作证和省纺织公司签发的随货同行单。但工商人员说：“无营业执照，罚款一百元。”我方再三争辩，还是罚了五十元。对过路的货车，有这样罚款的吗？
