South Korea announced the holding of a joint military exercise.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, South Korea's "Minister of Defense" formally announced on February 1 the "Spirit of Cooperation 89" joint military exercise.

The report said that the South Korean authorities, despite strong opposition from the North, blatantly announced the military exercise on the eve of the North-South dialogue, not only casting a shadow over the North-South dialogue but also proving that the United States and the South Korean authorities "do not genuinely want peace and peaceful reunification for Korea."

　　南朝鲜宣布举行联合军事演习
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：南朝鲜“国防部长官”二月一日正式宣布举行“协作精神八九”联合军事演习。
    报道说，南朝鲜当局不顾北方的强烈反对，公然在北南各渠道对话行将举行的前夕，宣布举行军事演习，不仅给北南对话投下了阴影，而且证明美国和南朝鲜当局“并不希望朝鲜的和平及和平统一”。
