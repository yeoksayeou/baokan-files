　　胡启立、李锡铭、芮杏文慰问首都公交战线职工
    据新华社北京２月６日电　（记者夏俊生）中共中央政治局常委胡启立、中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭和中共中央书记处书记芮杏文，今天上午先后来到北京市３３７路公共汽车象来街站和前门公共汽车站，看望公共交通行业节日坚持工作的职工。
    胡启立在给大家拜年时向全国公交战线上的千百万职工表示感谢和敬意。他说，今天，我们来看望大家，是表示对战斗在第一线同志们的感谢与尊敬，这不仅是我们几个人的心意，也是全市人民、全国人民的心意。
    李锡铭同志关切地询问司机、售票员们有没有吃上饺子，什么时候下班。在前门车站，曾经担任过建设部部长的芮杏文说：“我又回老家了。”他指着会议室里“全心全意为人民服务”的标语说，公交战线的老传统好，全心全意为人民服务还得提倡。
