Five Taiwanese fishermen spent the first day of the New Year on the mainland after their boat ran aground and was rescued. They celebrated the New Year happily on Dazhongshan Island.

The Taiwanese fishing boat "Xinxiangfa" ran aground off Xiaozhongshan Island in the waters outside the Pearl River estuary. On February 2, the boat had purchased goods in Zhapo Town, Yangjiang City, Guangdong Province, and was returning to Taiwan. Around 3 a.m., due to the darkness and rough seas, the boat's hull was punctured by a reef and began to sink. The five crew members immediately took measures to beach the boat on the nearby Xiaozhongshan Island. The Taiwanese fishermen endured hardships on this desolate island, awaiting rescue. At 4 a.m. on the 4th, soldiers stationed on Dazhongshan Island and local fishermen discovered the grounded Taiwanese fishing boat and promptly rescued them from the island. The boat has now been towed to a shipyard on Dazhongshan Island for repairs, and the five Taiwanese fishermen have been warmly received by local government officials and residents.

The island's military and civilians have also prepared sufficient food and fuel for the fishing boat. It is expected that the Taiwanese fishermen will be able to return to Taiwan in the coming days.

　　台湾五遇险渔民在大陆过年
    新华社广州２月７日电  （记者吴东峰、通讯员高宽郊）台湾渔轮“新乡发”号触礁遇险后获救。５名台湾渔民在大万山岛高高兴兴地度过了新春第一天。
    这艘台湾渔轮是在珠江口外的小万山岛洋面上触礁遇险的。２月２日，该轮从广东省阳江市闸坡镇购买货物后返回台湾。凌晨３点左右，由于天黑浪大，驾驶不慎，船底被礁石触了个洞，渐渐下沉。５名船员立即采取措施，将船靠上了附近的小万山岛。台湾渔民在这座人迹罕至的孤岛上艰难度日，等待救援。４日上午，大万山岛驻军和当地渔民发现了这条触礁的台湾渔轮，及时将他们救出孤岛。现在，渔轮已被送往大万山岛船厂修理，５名台湾渔民受到当地政府和群众的热情接待。
    岛上军民还为渔轮准备了充足的食品、燃料，预计台湾渔民近日便可返回台湾。
