The CPSU Central Committee held a meeting on February 3 and 4 with central and local officials responsible for ideological work to discuss urgent issues in current ideological work.

According to TASS, the meeting noted that during the process of economic and political reforms, phenomena such as national and group egoism have emerged. Some people have taken extreme views in evaluating history, reality, and the country's future prospects, and there are certain extreme views that are incompatible with socialist principles and ideals.

The meeting believed that under such circumstances, the methods of ideological work must be greatly improved. Political propaganda and daily explanations to the people should be based on reality and should take into account the difficulties in the economy, culture, and life.

The meeting demanded strengthening the propaganda role of public opinion tools. While ensuring the diversity of opinions and views, newspapers, radio, and television should first report on the matters and phenomena that determine the course of reform.

　　苏共中央讨论意识形态工作
    新华社莫斯科２月４日电  苏共中央３日和４日召集中央和地方主管意识形态工作的负责人会议，讨论了当前意识形态工作中的迫切问题。
    据塔斯社报道，会议指出，在经济改革和政治改革进程中，随之产生了民族利己主义和集团利己主义的现象，一些人对历史、现实和国家的发展前景作评价时走向极端，并存在着与社会主义原则和理想格格不入的某些极端看法。
    会议认为，在这种形势下，意识形态工作的方式方法必须大大改进，政治宣传和对人们的日常解释工作要以现实为依据，要考虑到经济、文化和生活中存在的困难。
    会议要求加强舆论工具的宣传作用，在确保意见和观点多样化的同时，报刊、广播和电视应首先报道那些决定改革进程的事情和现象。
