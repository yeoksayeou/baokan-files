Another batch of key power stations, coal mines, railways, postal and telecommunications, ports, and scientific research projects were completed and put into operation nationwide last year. These completed construction projects have added strong follow-up capabilities to China's modernization drive.

Statistics show that 203 key projects, organized by the state according to reasonable construction periods last year, completed an investment of 42.1 billion yuan, an increase of one and a half times over the previous year. Nationwide, 78 large and medium-sized basic construction projects and 138 single-item projects of large and medium-sized projects were completed and put into operation. From the perspective of the proportion of basic construction investment from state-owned enterprises, the proportion of production-oriented investment has increased, while the proportion of non-production-oriented investment has decreased.

Among the 22 national key projects completed and put into operation last year, the majority are projects that strengthen China's basic industries, with 10 being power projects. The total installed capacity is 271.5 million kilowatts. The largest hydropower project since the founding of the nation, the Gezhouba Hydropower Station, and the Jinwatian Hydropower Station, as well as the Fuzhou, Dalian, Shiheng, Jinzhou, Datong, and Jilin Changshan 6 thermal power plants, and the Xuzhou to Shanghai and Luohe via Pingquan to Fuchang two 500,000-volt transmission lines have been completed and put into operation, which will play an important role in alleviating the power shortage in the future. The opening of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Xuzhou-Yangzhou section, which was completed and accepted at the end of last year after more than six years of construction, has increased the water transport capacity for "north coal south" by more than 10 million tons per year. In addition, the completion of projects such as the Hengyang-Guangzhou double-track railway, Tianjin railway hub, Beijing 40,000-line program-controlled telephone exchange, Shanghai program-controlled telephone production line, Baotou aluminum plant, Qingtongxia aluminum plant, Shanxi fertilizer plant, Changsha artificial board plant, and Tianjin soda plant have effectively compensated for the weak links in China's national economy.

It is understood that due to the completion and operation of large and medium-sized projects and single-item projects last year, the new production capacity added nationwide is: 9.99 million kilowatts of power generation capacity, 30.9 million tons of raw coal mining, 15.77 million tons of crude oil mining, 600,000 tons of ethylene, 2.46 million tons of cement, 7.92 million metric tons of flat glass, 419 kilometers of railway operational mileage, 820 kilometers of double-track railway mileage, 1,487 kilometers of electrified railway mileage, and 8.78 million tons of coastal port throughput capacity.

　　又一批基础工业项目竣工投产   
    去年建成大中型项目七十余个，单项工程一百余个
    新华社北京２月１７日电  （记者徐克洪）去年全国又有一批重点电站、煤矿、铁路、邮电、港口及科研的项目建成，已投入生产运转的这些基本建设项目为我国的现代化建设增添了强劲的后续能力。
    资料表明，去年国家按合理工期组织建设的２０３个重点项目共完成投资４２１亿元，比上年增长了一成半多。全国建成投产的大中型基本建设项目７８个，大中型项目单项工程１３８个。从全民所有制单位基本建设投资的比重来看，生产性建设投资比例有所上升，非生产性投资比重下降。
    去年全部建成投产的２２个国家重点项目中，绝大部分是加强我国基础工业的项目，其中电力项目就占了１０个。总装机容量２７１．５万千瓦，建国以来最大的水电建设项目葛洲坝水电站以及金水滩水电站，福州、大连、石横、锦州、大同、吉林长山６个火电厂，徐州至上海、洛河经平圩至繁昌的两条５０万伏输变电线路的建成投产，将为今后缓解电力紧张局面发挥重要作用。经过６年多建设于去年底通过验收的京杭运河徐（州）扬（州）段的开通，使“北煤南调”的水运能力增加了年千万吨以上。此外，衡广复线、天津铁路枢纽、北京４万门程控电话交换机、上海程控电话生产线、包头铝厂、青铜峡铝厂、山西化肥厂、长沙人造板厂、天津碱厂等项目的建成，都有效地弥补了我国国民经济中的薄弱环节。
    据了解，由于去年建成的大中型项目和单项工程投入生产，全国新增加的生产能力有：发电装机容量９９９万千瓦，原煤开采３０９０万吨，原油开采１５７７万吨，乙烯６０万吨，水泥２４６万吨，平板玻璃７９２万重量箱，铁路交付营业里程４１９公里，铁路复线里程８２０公里，铁路电气化里程１４８７公里，沿海港口吞吐能力８７８万吨。
