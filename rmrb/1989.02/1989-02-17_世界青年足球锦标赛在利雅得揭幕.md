The World Youth Football Championship opens in Riyadh

New China News Agency, Riyadh, February 16 – (Reporter Wu Yihong) The final stage of the fifth World Youth Football Championship began today in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The 16 teams that have advanced to the finals will compete over the next 16 days, and the outcome is highly anticipated.

According to the competition rules, the 16 teams will be divided into 4 groups and will compete in Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Taif, four cities in Saudi Arabia.

The host team, Saudi Arabia, and Portugal are slightly favored in Group A. Both teams have strong defensive capabilities and powerful attacking lines. However, Saudi Arabia has the advantage of home field and familiarity, which may allow them to exceed expectations.

Group B is similar to Group A, with Costa Rica and the Soviet Union having the upper hand in tactics, individual skills, and physical fitness. Their style of play is practical and efficient. Costa Rica, which has entered the World Youth Championship finals for the first time with an undefeated record, is considered by local media to have the potential to be the "dark horse" of this tournament. The Soviet team is tall and strong, with fast running speeds and aggressive tackling, making them a team with the potential to win the championship.

Group C's situation is more complex, with Brazil, Mali, the United States, and East Germany each representing different styles of play from Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The world's powerhouse, Brazil, plays with finesse and emphasizes individual coordination. However, in the South American preliminary round of this championship, they had mediocre results, finishing second in their group with a 3-1 record behind Colombia. There are still doubts about whether Brazil can advance to the next round.

Group D's Argentina is the team with the highest chance of winning the championship this year. In the South American preliminary round, they won all five matches without conceding a goal and finished first in their group.

　　世界青年足球锦标赛在利雅得揭幕
    新华社利雅得２月１６日电  （记者吴毅宏）第五届世界青年足球锦标赛决赛阶段比赛今天在沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得开幕，进入决赛的１６强将展开为期１６天的角逐，谁能夺魁令人注目。
    根据比赛规程，１６支球队将分为４个小组分别在沙特阿拉伯的利雅得、达曼、吉达和塔伊夫４个城市进行较量。
    东道主沙特阿拉伯和葡萄牙队在Ａ组略占优势。这两队水平接近，都具有防守严密、锋线攻击力强的特点。但沙特队占有地利、人和，有可能超水平发挥。
    Ｂ组情况与Ａ组雷同，哥斯达黎加队和苏联队在战术打法、个人技术和身体素质方面占有优势。他们的打法讲究实效，不拖泥带水。哥队以不败的纪录首次进入世青赛决赛圈，此间舆论认为它有可能成为本届比赛的“黑马”。苏联队队员身高体壮，奔跑速度快，拚抢积极，是一支具有夺冠实力的队伍。
    Ｃ组的形势较为复杂，巴西队、马里队、美国队和民主德国队分别代表欧洲、非洲和美洲的不同流派打法。世界劲旅巴西队打法细腻，讲究个人配合，但在本届锦标赛南美赛区预赛第二组比赛中，成绩平平，以３胜１负的成绩列哥伦比亚队之后出线。人们对巴西队能否进入复赛还存有疑问。
    Ｄ组的阿根廷队是本届比赛夺标呼声最高的队伍，在南美赛区预赛中５战皆捷不失一球，获小组第一名。
