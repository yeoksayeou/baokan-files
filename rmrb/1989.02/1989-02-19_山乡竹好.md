It had been raining continuously for days, but today the rain had turned into a light drizzle. We decided to go to the bamboo sea. The journey was bumpy, and after several hours, we finally saw Wanlingqing—the bamboo country of southern Sichuan, covering over a hundred square miles. It stretches across the counties of Jiang'an and Changning. There are over 40 hills, some of which are gentle slopes, deep valleys, or flat plains. Now, they are all covered with towering bamboo.

I asked the boatman what kind of bamboo the boat pole was made from. He replied, "Luan bamboo." The props for the small coal mines are also made from Luan bamboo. The bamboo baskets that the women carry on their backs, in which the children are so accustomed to the mountain roads that they happily bounce along, are also made from Luan bamboo. The boat covers, whether they have faded or are newly painted, have sailed through countless mountains and rivers. Naturally, they are made from Luan bamboo. The bamboo is not ancient, nor are its branches weak. In terms of character, it is sturdy and upright, and in the misty atmosphere of the mountains, it appears even more verdant and lush. I am not trying to paint a picture with my eyelids, but rather, my soul is so close to this dense forest: I can smell the autumn air; I can smell the fresh mushrooms; I can smell the new bamboo forest—the warmth of the earth rising, the dampness of the forest when it is weeded. There are butterflies flying by, bees sucking nectar, and perhaps snakes slithering nearby, all drenched by the rain. This scent is green, sweet, and belongs to the quiet moments of life. I walked along the winding stone path, but I didn't encounter any wild rabbits jumping out of the pits. Instead, a pheasant, with its colorful feathers reflecting the light, flew away with a "pfft" sound.

At that time, I was still a teenager. I lay with her on the soft bamboo leaves. I remember it was spring, the time of scattered willow catkins. We couldn't afford anything else, so we each held a few pieces of fruit candy. Even if the candy wasn't sweet, it didn't matter. With her by my side, we walked along the narrow path, passed through a wilderness, and then through a sparse thicket, strolling to the purple bamboo grove (it was smaller than the Luan bamboo grove, with green and deep purple stalks). Although sometimes we would bump into bamboo whips or thorny bushes, we still rolled over twenty or so places covered with soft, dream-like leaves. The sackcloth-like upper garment was originally old, and now it was even more tattered, but what did that matter? Even things that have been eroded have a kind of flawed beauty. She still took out the needle and thread from her bag, "Come, let me sew it up. You'll have to take care of yourself from now on..." No matter how low her voice was, I still heard it. I didn't dare to ask, and the snow and wind had stripped away all the flower buds. Suddenly, everything in front of me was a gray, desolate winter. I thought she had considered my request and decided not to leave, but now...

"Let me tell you the truth, I am already a married woman." "Why didn't you tell me earlier?" "I only recently found out. In a battle, he was martyred. They say that on a hailstorm day, he and several other Long March comrades were buried under the snow mountain. I have to go to his grave and find my orphaned child..."

Tears clung to the bamboo leaves. I was stunned. "You go with the other students to eat. You'll get used to it, and it will be lively. Here is some money, buy meal tickets. Be careful not to burn yourself with hot water. The water fee I gave to the old man in the water room is enough to last until you graduate." In the early days of the war of resistance, I felt like I had an older sister. No, how could someone two years older than me have such maternal love? In her calmness, there was a burning passion?

That was a moonlit night. I walked down several dozen steps and saw her off on the boat. I didn't say a word and walked away, afraid to hear the ship's whistle... I had seen the unbearable sorrow of those who see off loved ones. In a vast, distant wilderness, I cried. Several months later, I heard that her child had been lost in a village. The grave of her beloved was not found, and it was hard to say whether it had collapsed or been dug up. She herself had contracted a condition similar to blood clots and vertigo. On a postcard, she wrote: I am a hurried traveler, I don't know if this world, this homeland, still needs me. Please encourage me...

Now I am in the Luan bamboo grove. What a beautiful, fresh gallery! I have the desire but not the strength to record the halo of the bamboo. The waves of bamboo leaves under the gentle breeze, rustling and harmonious, so pure and simple. With the memory of last night's heavy rain and broken dreams, it seems to have washed away the mist and rain—with today's feelings, I am strangely calm. I feel as if I am in the fresh morning light, in a warm, floating circle, in the small house of a sincere friend who speaks from the heart, making me unable to suppress my excitement. I gaze at the mountains, and the mountains whisper to the distant blue-green sky, to the birds with wise eyes on the red vines. The grass flowers named Honghualanglang are even more charming.

Soon, the thick mist drifted in, truly like a spirit, rising from the lowlands to the highlands. The stone-carved Earth Store Bodhisattva shrine, carved from the green rocks, extends to the opposite mountain. Gradually, everything became hazy and gloomy, and everything that could be hidden was hidden. It was as if my companion in the curve and depth was calling me. I also called out to my companion.

The mist is not a flame, but it has a melting power. The round and long joints, even if covered with a light veil and a silk net, are not pale and lifeless, but transparent, feeling more distant and deeper; the leaves intertwined with spirits are more refreshing than ink floating on water.

However, the bamboo shoot diggers were still swinging their hoes, occasionally looking around, but they didn't notice that the mist was like the wings of a weary bird, slowly folding...

Outside the fence of the bamboo grove, on the ground, there were trays of dried bamboo shoots and tips. This was an individual peddler selling them. On the long table were neatly packaged, also dried, tooth bamboo shoots, being sold by a state-owned salesperson. The bamboo shoot diggers came before the small snow festival, taking advantage of the mist to sneak in. Some say they are like snakes coiled up, moving slowly and stopping, trying not to attract attention.

I saw a stone-carved Bamboo Buddha (a work by a stoneworker from the late Ming dynasty, now moved to the folk museum), carved with a kind of simple beauty, honest and sturdy. It makes you feel that the god is not eternal, but a real memory of a farmer's daily life. I met the guard of the Luan bamboo grove next to the bamboo seller. He was as honest as the Bamboo Buddha, "Many leaves mean the branches are bent, few leaves mean the branches are upright." He really looked a bit like bamboo. He said he was bored when he was idle and had energy when he was busy; he asked me, "Do you smoke black-stemmed tobacco? It can dispel phlegm without coughing." I took a puff, and my throat itched, making me cough. I asked him, "Can't you stop them from digging bamboo shoots?" "A hungry dog climbs a wall, its hind legs can't hold on, we can't grab them to the end..." "Once the new shoots are gone, the child bamboo won't grow!" Someone next to me interrupted, "We dig the male bamboo shoots!" I said, "You're lying, only female bamboo shoots produce more shoots... You tell me, haven't you dug up the unspouted tooth bamboo shoots? How can you tell the difference between a single-stemmed male bamboo and a double-stemmed female bamboo?" They laughed, "Master craftsmen get a discount on bamboo shoots..." "With your brains, the bamboo will bloom, and the whole forest will be ruined!" I knew my words couldn't enlighten their hearts. I told our Bamboo Buddha, "Completely rely on you to protect it seriously. A little less wind and rain would be good!"

The bamboo reed factory dispelled some of our unpleasant thoughts (they weren't removing the old shoots in March and April, but rather a nest of winter shoots). Here, the spring flowers and autumn harvests, the repeated shapes, condensed the beauty of the bamboo sea into an art workshop. The factory director insisted that I leave a poem, so I had to write one on the spot: "Wanling lies green in southern Sichuan, the yellow color is bright and painted in Jiang'an. The carving and cutting techniques of the bamboo flowers, support the colorful jade sky." But writing a poem is not as good as nature. In the art gallery, there is a legend: Su Dongpo once wrote bamboo with a red pen, which made him transcend the bamboo by his side. A friend asked: Have you ever seen mirror-sand bamboo? Dongpo retorted: Painted bamboo is everywhere, but have you ever appreciated the ink-colored bamboo? The joints and leaves of the mountain bamboo are truly good! I hope it's not like this October day, but rather a summer morning when every village is dressed in new clothes, and then go to see Wanlingqing again. The small female bamboo garden should be lush with sprouting bamboo everywhere. The bamboo stalks must be much more lush. The sunlight penetrates the atmosphere, and unknowingly, the orange-red light flickers, and countless bamboo shoots should be like green silk...

Grass plants are always prosperous at night, and by evening, they will be even more so. Under the bright moonlight, in the light of the colors, looking at the side, back, and front are all high and refreshing pillars...

　　山乡竹好
    骆文
    天天阴雨连绵，这一天算是遇到个小雨转阴天，我们决定去竹海。车程颠簸，数小时后，终于见到万岭箐——蜀南这片百多里方圆的楠竹之乡。它横卧在江安、长宁两个县境。有４０多匹山岭，或中丘，或缓坡，或高岩深谷，也有有坎有洼的平坝，如今已遍布凌云直干。
    我问过船家，篙杆是啥竹作的？答曰：楠竹。小煤窑的锚杆也是楠竹的。大嫂背篓里背的娃娃，习惯了山路了，小东西颠着颠着还是像衔住奶嘴那么高兴。一问，被艳阳照得娇黄的娃娃背篓里全是楠竹簧、楠竹青编成的。退了漆色或者是新上漆色的船篷，迎过多少山接过多少水呀，它自然也是扎簰作舟的楠竹材料了。楠竹干不古朴，枝不柔弱；论其性格，坚挺而修立，在山的云气氛围中，更显得青青苍苍。我不是用眼帘对画布在试油彩，而是心灵和这带蓊翳密林贴得如此之近：我闻到了收秋天的气息；闻到了一个个鲜蘑菇的气息；闻到新竹上林——地温回升、薅林时的潮湿味；有蝶飞过，有蜂吮吸过，也许有蛇在周边游弋过被天落水淋过的雨花雨叶味。——这味道是绿色的，甘甜的，是属于恬静时刻的生命的。我朝着延伸碎石路走去，没遇到从陷窟窜出的野兔，倒是一只雉鸡，披着从菱境映出的那种多彩羽毛“扑”的一下飞走了……
    那时候我还是少年。我和她躺在松软的竹叶上。记得是春天，是柳花飏散的仲春时节，我们吃不起什么别的东西，一人手里拿着几颗水果糖，糖即便不甜也不要紧，有她和我走在细路上，过了一片荒林，又过了一片疏丛，信步来到紫竹林（反正比楠竹林小，竿青而深紫）。尽管有时会碰到竹鞭，会碰到棘丛，可我们两个还是滚过一二十处铺撒着梦样的娇柔的茸叶。麻袋片似的上衣原本是破旧的，这会儿越发褴褛了，但这又算得什么，被剥蚀了的东西不也有缺陷之美吗？还是她拿出提包里的针线，“来，给你缝上。可以后就要自己照应自己了……”不管她说的声音多低，我还是听到了，我不敢提问，雪折风噬，所有的花蕊都掐去了。眼前立刻是灰蒙蒙的残冬。我原以为她考虑了我的要求不再说走了，而现在……“实说了吧，我已经是有家的人。”“为什么不早告诉我？”“最近我才知道，一次战斗中他牺牲了。说是一个下雹子天和其他几位长征同志在雪山下埋了。我要去上坟，还要寻找我的孤儿……”箬叶上粘着她的泪水。我木然。“你和别的同学一起去吃饭，会习惯的，总会热闹起来的。这里还有点钱，买饭票。打水别烫着。水房老头那里我给的水费足够用到毕业了。”抗战之初的苦难时代，我像遇到个姐姐了。不，长我两岁的人怎么会有慈母样的爱？于沉稳中蕴含着炽烈的感情？
    那是个月夜，走下几十级台阶，我送她上了船，我什么也没说，怏怏地走了。生怕听见开船的汽笛……我曾见过送行人的止不住的悲辛。在很远很远的旷野，我哭泣了。几个月之后，知道她的孩子在一个村里丢失了。爱人的墓也没寻到，很难说是塌了还是叫人挖了。自己却得了竟与血栓相匹的晕旋症。在一张明信片上她说：我是匆忙赶路的人，不知道这世界，——这故土还要不要我，请鼓励我吧……
    如今我是在楠竹林里。多美的新鲜的画廊呵，我有这个欲望，却没有这力量把竹的光环记下来。微风吹动下的竹叶之波，潇潇瑟瑟，如此和谐而纯朴。带着昨天急雨梦断的记忆，好像浣净了岚云瘴雨了——怀着今天的感觉，我反倒很安详。我仿佛置身于清新的晨光中，置身于一个浮动的温暖的圆簸里，置身于道出心声的恳挚朋友的小屋，使我终于抑制不住激情。我瞻望群山，山在向微黄碧色的天际絮语，向朱藤上有慧眼的鸟儿絮语。名叫红花浪浪的草花更妩媚了。
    不一会，沉沉雾气澹然飘来，真的有如气韵，从低处漫上高处。从翠岩凿出的地藏神龛延向对山。渐渐浑茫惨黯，能被隐没的都隐没了。有如在曲处在深处我的旅伴叫着我。我也叫着我的旅伴。
    雾非火焰，可有它的熔化力。不过圆而且长的竿节，尽管蒙上轻纱，披上丝网，并不苍白并不呆滞，透视过去，感到更远更深；叶叶交加的精灵比之以墨浮水的水画还要清润。
    然而掘笋人却在挥动着锄头，时而张望着什么，可就是没有想到雾像倦怠的鸟的翅膀正在收敛……在林子栅栏外，地摊上摆着一盘盘干笋笋尖，这是个体小贩在兜售。搁在长条桌上则是包装整齐了的，也是晒干的牙笋，由公家售货员在叫卖。掘笋人不到小雪节令就趁雾罩升时溜来了，有人说他们像蛇盘着的黾，慢走慢停，竭力不惹人们注意。
    我见到一座石雕的竹公菩萨（明末某位石工的作品，如今已经移到民俗博物馆了），镂镌得有种单纯美，敦厚、粗壮。它让你对神的感觉并不具有永恒性，而是日常生活中庄稼人给你的实际的记忆。我在卖笋人旁边碰上楠竹林的守林人，他竟像竹公菩萨那样憨厚，“叶多则枝伏，叶少则枝昂”，真的和竹子有些相近，他说他闲的时候发闷，忙的时候有劲；问我：“抽不抽黑杆烟？不咳嗽还能祛痰。”我吸了一口，嗓子一痒就咳起来了。我问他：“叫他们不挖笋不行？”“饿狗子上墙，后爪不得力，我们没有一抓到底……”“新笋一去，子竹不就不长了？”旁边的人冲着我插嘴了：“我们挖的是公竹笋！”我说：“你想谎人，只有雌竹出笋多……你说说，没出土的牙笋你们刨了挖了，又怎辨得出单枝的公竹、双枝的母竹？”他们打起哈哈了：“老师傅要笋打个八折……”“有了你们这些脑壳，竹子就要开花，满林遭殃！”我知道我这样说一点也不能透亮他们的心。我对我们的竹公菩萨讲：“完全靠你们保护认真了。少点风枝雨竿就好！”
    竹簧工艺厂消除了我们有些不快的思绪（他们不是三四月天搞的退笋，而是一窝窝冬笋芽芽）。这里春花秋熟的景致，重现再现的造型，把竹海之美浓缩在一个艺术车间了。厂长一定要我留诗，我只好随想随写这么一绝：“万岭青青卧蜀南，娇黄色丽画江安。镗功刃技雕花竹，托起斑斓翡翠天。”而赋诗，怎么也不及自然。画苑中有个传说：苏东坡曾用朱笔写竹，可见庭侧之竹使他神魂飞越了。友人相问：你何曾见过镜面砂竹？东坡反诘：画幅墨竹比比皆是，君何曾赏鉴过墨彩之竹？山乡的竿节枝叶真好！但愿不像这十月天，而找个村村都着新妆的夏晨，再去看看万岭箐，四处生笋的小母竹园该要繁茂起来了，竹株一定茂盛得多。阳光穿透大气，不知不觉间，橙红色光影闪动了，千万竿竹筠，该会像青青绢绸一样吧。禾科植物总是朝荣夜舒，一到晚间它会更加超拔，皎皎月夜，在光的彩调中看侧面背面和正面都是高爽的廊柱……
