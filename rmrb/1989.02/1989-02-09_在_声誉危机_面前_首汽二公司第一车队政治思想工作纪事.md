In the face of a reputation crisis

— A Record of Political and Ideological Work in the First Team of Beijing Automobile Company Second Branch

Recently, Beijing's streets saw a crisis with TAXI (taxis), a genuine reputation crisis. For a time, newspapers and radio stations competed to expose the issue, sparking much street gossip, causing the once-glamorous "princesses" to become "Cinderellas" in people's minds.

How are things now? We visited the First Team of the Second Branch of the Capital Automobile Company. According to comrades from the Party Committee Office of the Second Branch, this team has focused on strengthening ideological and political work during the deepening of enterprise reforms, improving the quality of employees, and relatively well completing various tasks.

In a row of small houses west of the Kunlun Hotel in Beijing, the team leaders recounted the ordinary deeds of two Communist Party members.

Story One: On a rainy morning, Communist Party member and driver Zhang Yongnong set out early. Every day, he takes a public bus from Haidian District's Zhongguancun for over an hour to get to work. The bus stop was crowded with anxious people, and the pouring rain made the usually calm Zhang anxious. The customers were waiting, and he couldn't afford to be delayed by the rain. In a moment of urgency, he quickly hailed a taxi and explained the situation. When the driver learned that this colleague was taking a taxi to get to work on time, he was deeply moved and promptly got him to his post. The story of "a taxi driver taking a taxi" quickly became a popular tale.

Story Two: Not long ago, Communist Party member Li Dawu drove a foreign guest to a hotel. A group of thugs swarmed around the disembarking guest, demanding to exchange foreign currency and using foul language towards the female guide. Upon hearing this, Li, who had jumped out of the car, bravely intervened, pushing away the crowd and scolding the criminals. Unexpectedly, he was overwhelmed and beaten unconscious. When he came to, despite his injuries, he immediately reported the incident to the public security authorities, ensuring that the group of criminals was brought to justice and justice was served.

Just as they were speaking, we saw a large sedan drive into the yard. The team leader gave a signal, and several administrative staff rushed over, wiping the car and changing the seat covers, busy at work. In the First Team, this has become a routine. According to the team leader, the purpose of this is to strengthen communication between leaders and drivers, and to smooth out the drivers' emotions. The driver who had just gotten off the car said, "This is very natural because we are a family."

Indeed, the First Team has a harmonious atmosphere, which is the result of the team leaders and the Party branch's efforts. While emphasizing the exemplary role of Communist Party members, they also focus on detailed ideological and political work, given the characteristics of a high proportion of young workers and dispersed personnel. They changed the simple method of large-scale lectures and rote recitation, adopting various forms such as visiting points, individual chats, home visits, parent-teacher meetings, virtuous spouse commendation meetings, and consultation meetings, closely linking cadres with employees and employees' families with team management. To address the concerns of employees, they also established a family emergency hotline and formed a living guarantee group. When employees are on duty outside and their families encounter difficulties, they can call the team, and the service group composed of team leaders, deputy team leaders, and Party branch secretaries will step in to help, replacing gas, buying coal, buying chimneys, buying medicine, accompanying family members to the hospital, repairing leaky roofs, and covering roofs during the rainy season, doing everything and anything.

The ideological and political work has yielded significant results, allowing the team to fully engage in various tasks. They established the service tenet of "sincerely serving guests" for the entire team, supplemented by strict standardized management, and built a strong team of employees. Driver Li Jingdong, during the task of the Second National Military Model Conference, drove for Shi Guangzhu, Liu Zhuang, and Zhang Yaping, among others, seven severely disabled military models. During the conference, in the midst of the scorching summer, he insisted on carrying the military models in and out of the car. When visiting the Great Wall, he carried Liu Zhuang up, his sweat soaking his clothes several times. How about treating ordinary people? Look at the letter of thanks from three blind people who took four hours, helped each other, and changed cars four times, specially from Xiangshan to the team to give to young worker Gao Zhimin: ... We are not heroes or famous figures, just three ordinary blind people. Gao Zhimin's thoughtful care drove away the darkness in front of us, as if we saw his kind face and sincere heart ...

The First Team of Beijing Automobile Company Second Branch, due to its effective ideological and political work, has aroused the enthusiasm of employees, and the social and economic benefits of the enterprise have significantly improved. The "window" industry is seeing the light again.

　　在“声誉危机”面前
　　——首汽二公司第一车队政治思想工作纪事
　　马岑　刘福明
    前一时期，北京街头，ＴＡＸＩ（出租汽车），发生了危机，一场名副其实的声誉危机。一时间，报纸电台争相披露，招来不少街谈巷议，致使漂亮豪华的“公主”们在人们心目中变成了“灰姑娘”。
    现在，他们的境况如何呢？我们走访了首都汽车公司第二分公司第一车队。据第二分公司党委办公室同志介绍，这个车队在深化企业改革中，注重加强思想政治工作，职工素质得到提高，较好地完成了各项工作。
    在北京昆仑饭店西边的一排小平房里，车队领导讲起两位共产党员平凡的事迹。
    故事之一：一个大雨倾盆的早晨，共产党员、司机张永农提前出发，他每天都要从海淀区中关村乘公共汽车赶一个多小时的路上班，车站上挤满了焦急的人群，如注的大雨使一向沉稳的张师傅心急如焚，客户在等，千万不能被大雨耽搁。情急智生，他急忙拦住一辆出租车讲明情况，当司机得知这位同行因为赶任务自费乘出租时，深受感动。及时送他上了岗位。一时，“出租车司机乘出租车”传为佳话。
    故事之二：前不久，共产党员李大武驾车送外宾到某饭店。一群不法分子蜂拥围住下车的客人，强行索换外汇，还对导游小姐污言秽语，闻讯跳下车来的李师傅见义勇为，分开众人斥责歹徒，不料，竟被歹徒一拥而上，打昏在地。当他醒来时，不顾伤痛向公安部门及时报案，终使这群不法之徒落入法网，伸张了正义。
    正说之间，我们看到一辆大轿车驶进车场。只见队长一声招呼，几位内勤一哄而上，擦车、换座套，忙碌起来。在一队，这已成为惯例。据队长说，此举目的在于加强干群之间的沟通，调理顺畅司机的情绪；而刚走下车的司机则说：“这很自然，因为我们是一家人。”
    的确，一队有一种和谐的氛围，这是车队领导和党支部耕耘的结果，在强调共产党员的模范作用的同时，针对青工多，人员分散等特点，做细致的思想政治工作。他们改变大会宣讲、照本宣科的简单方式，采用下点走访、个别谈心、家访、家长会、贤内助表彰会、恳谈会等多种形式，使干部与职工、职工家庭与车队管理紧密联系在一起。为解决职工后顾之忧，他们还建立家属急难电话，成立生活保障小组。职工出勤在外家里有困难，打电话给车队，由正副队长、党支部书记等人组成的服务小组迎难而上，换煤气、买煤、买烟囱、买药、家属看病，雨季里修漏房、苫房顶无所不能、无所不做。
    思想政治工作大见成效，使车队得以在各项工作中放开手脚，他们在全队确立“真心为宾客服务”的服务宗旨，辅之以严格的标准化管理，建成了一支过得硬的职工队伍。司机李敬东在执行第二届全军英模会任务中，为史光柱、刘庄、展亚平等七位特残英模开车。大会期间，时值酷暑，他始终坚持背英模上、下车。游览长城，他背负刘庄登上了长城，汗水几遍湿透衣衫。对待英模如此，对待普通人呢？请看三位盲人历时四小时，相互搀扶，换车四次专程从香山到车队送给青工高志明的感谢信：……我们不是什么英雄人物，知名人士，只不过是三个普普通通的盲人，而高志明同志体贴入微地照顾我们，他的热诚服务驱散了我们眼前的黑暗，仿佛看到了他那和蔼可亲的面庞和那颗赤诚的心……
    首汽二公司一队，由于思想政治工作做到了实处，唤起了职工的工作热情，企业的社会效益和经济效益明显提高，“窗口”行业再见光明。
