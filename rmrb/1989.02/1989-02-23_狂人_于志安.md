The Madman Yu Zhi'an

By Xinhua reporters Deng Quanshi and Yang Zhengwen

"An entrepreneur should be a Sun Wukong who can leap ten thousand eight thousand miles, not a monkey in the hands of a monkey trainer." This bold statement comes from Yu Zhi'an, the director and party secretary of Wuhan Steam Turbine Generator Factory. No wonder some people say Yu Zhi'an is quite the madman.

Yu Zhi'an does have a bit of a mad streak. In 1982, he became the director of Wuhan Steam Turbine Generator Factory. Just one year later, this factory, which was the biggest loser in the industry nationwide, turned its losses into profits. As the factory grew more prosperous, Yu Zhi'an started to make waves again. In 1986, he established a company without a "mother-in-law" — "Changjiang Power Company." This company is only registered with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce; it does not rely on or belong to any ministry, commission, province, or city. It has merged and combined with over 130 member factories across 18 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, employing 140,000 workers. On January 18 of this year, Yu Zhi'an made another shocking move: Changjiang Power Company took over 23 enterprises under the Wuhan Municipal Materials Bureau, employing over 10,000 workers.

Yu Zhi'an is "mad" and "disrespectful to superiors." Take, for example, when he first became the director of Wuhan Steam Turbine Generator Factory. There were over 1,000 unemployed children of the factory workers. The factory decided to first solve the employment of a few hundred children as "collective workers" to ease the worries of some workers. When they went to the higher authorities to handle the procedures, the supervising department actually demanded 10% of the employment quota, otherwise, they would not approve it. Yu Zhi'an sent people to repeatedly explain the factory's difficulties, hoping the higher authorities would understand. But the "mother-in-law" just wouldn't listen and wouldn't stamp the approval. Yu Zhi'an got serious. He told the office staff: "If they don't approve, I will approve it! Not a single quota will be given!"

"Of course," Yu Zhi'an told the reporter, "after that, I didn't get a few pairs of small shoes. But we are not afraid. We will kick through glass shoes and cut through steel shoes with a welding torch. Whoever thinks they can come here to seek personal gain, forget it!" Yu Zhi'an continued with his "mad" talk: "If you really want to run a business, the director cannot be yes-man, kowtowing to temples and burning incense to gods. As long as your own ass is clean, what are you afraid of? You are an entrepreneur, a legal representative!"

Yu Zhi'an is so "mad" that sometimes he is very frugal with money, calculating to the penny. The director of this factory with an annual output value of over 200 million yuan, the commander of a 140,000-strong army, does not have a luxurious foreign car, and his office does not have an air conditioner. The factory's guesthouse, except for two rooms for receiving foreign guests, does not install air conditioners or place color TVs in other rooms. Entertaining guests is a set meal, ensuring they are full and have enough calories, but absolutely not allowing a big feast. The office staff told the reporter that Yu Zhi'an is very restrained with "advertising" and has no enthusiasm for "sponsorship" activities. Some "monks" who know Yu Zhi'an is an "iron rooster" also lose the courage to come to the door. The previous year, "Changjiang Power Company" held an annual meeting, inviting the heads of various member factories to Wuhan. Yu Zhi'an gave a report and then discussed. The two-day meeting did not have a banquet and did not issue souvenirs, only spending 2,000 yuan on printing documents and materials.

### “狂人”于志安

　　“狂人”于志安
    新华社记者  邓全施  杨正文
    “企业家应是一个筋头翻十万八千里的孙大圣，不能是耍猴人手里牵的猴子”。“狂言”出自武汉汽轮发电机厂厂长兼党委书记于志安之口。怪不得有人说于志安够狂的。
    于志安真有点狂劲。１９８２年他任武汉汽轮发电机厂厂长。一年后，这个全国同行业的亏损冠军就扭亏为盈。工厂越办越兴隆，于志安又折腾开了。１９８６年，他组建起一个无“婆婆”的大公司——“长江动力公司”。这个公司只在国家工商行政管理局注册，它既不挂靠也不隶属于任何一个部、委或省、市。它兼并、联合的成员厂家有１３０多个，跨全国１８个省市区，职工１４万。今年１月１８日，于志安又来了惊人之举：长江动力公司承包了拥有１万多名职工的武汉市建材局所属的２３个企业。
    于志安“狂”得“不尊重领导”。就说他刚到武汉汽轮发电机厂当厂长那时吧，厂里有１０００多职工子女待业。厂里决定先解决几百名子弟当“集体工”，以解除部分职工的后顾之忧。当他们到上级办理手续时，主管部门竟然提出要拿走１０％的就业指标，否则不予批准。于志安派人反复讲明企业的困境，希望上级谅解。但“婆婆”就是不听，不给盖章。于志安认真起来了。他对厂办公室同志说：他们不批，我来批！指标一个也不给！
    “当然罗”，于志安对记者说：“此后小鞋没给少穿。但我们不怕。玻璃小鞋就踢破它，钢丝小鞋我们有电焊枪割裂它。谁想到我们这里搞以权谋私，没门！”于志安继续口出“狂言”：“要真真格格地办企业，厂长就不能唯唯诺诺，见庙磕头，见神烧香。只要你自己屁股没有屎，你有什么可怕的？你是企业家，是法人代表嘛！”
    于志安如此之“狂”，有时花钱却很胆小，精打细算得抠门。这个年产值超过２亿元的工厂厂长，这个统帅１４万大军的公司总经理，却没有豪华型的洋轿车，办公室也没有空调器。厂里的招待所，除两间接待外宾的客房有空调外，别的房间一律不装空调，不摆彩电。招待客人是份饭制，保证吃饱，热量足够，但绝不允许十碟八碗大吃海喝。厂办同志告诉记者，于志安对“广告”宣传很节制，对“赞助”活动无热情，有些“化缘”的“和尚”知道于志安是“铁公鸡”，也就没了上门来的勇气。前年，“长江动力公司”召开年会，请各成员厂家负责人到武汉。于志安作个报告，然后讨论。两天会议，既不会餐，也不发纪念品，只是打印文件资料花了２０００元钱。　　　　　　　　（新华社供本报专稿）
