Liling Handles Illegal Detention of Citizens
Former Deputy Police Chief Indicted

LONGSHAN, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) — On Feb. 23, the Liling City People's Procuratorate in Hunan Province filed an indictment against the former deputy police chief of Liling City, Cheng Chuming, for the crime of illegal detention. On the same day, the procuratorate decided to drop charges against the former police chief, Yi Dacheng, who was also involved in the illegal detention but whose actions were deemed less severe.

In April 1987, villagers from Xiaodong Village in Hongyuan Township, including Huang Yongfu and Huang Yongshu, repeatedly complained to relevant authorities about discrepancies in the accounts of a village-owned firecracker factory. The township and city governments sent personnel to audit the accounts but did not disclose the results to the villagers. This led to dissatisfaction among Huang Yongfu and Huang Yongshu, who subsequently engaged in some extreme behaviors.

On the morning of Aug. 21, 1987, Cheng Chuming and 17 other police officers and security personnel went to Xiaodong Village to summon Huang Yongfu but failed. They then arbitrarily ordered another villager, Huang Yongquan, to do some work. When Huang refused, one officer grabbed his wrist while another security personnel struck him with a large electric baton, provoking public outrage and leading to a scuffle between the villagers and the officers.

At around 1 a.m. on Aug. 22, during a meeting convened by the former police chief Yi Dacheng, Cheng Chuming reported the situation, concealing the fact that the police officers and security personnel had forced the villagers to work and had struck first. He also distorted the facts, proposing to detain Huang Yongfu and six others. In the afternoon, Yi Dacheng convened another meeting and, without any evidence or formal case filing, decided to detain Huang Yongfu and six others on charges of disrupting collective production and obstructing public duties.

Subsequently, over 120 police officers and security personnel, led by Yi Dacheng and Cheng Chuming, arrived in Xiaodong Village in 15 vehicles and detained 22 villagers. During this process, Cheng Chuming beat and verbally abused several villagers. Yi Dacheng ordered all the detained individuals to be taken to the Nanqiao Township government. After interrogating them individually, based solely on their statements, the police decided to educate and release seven, and to detain eight for further investigation. The 22 detained villagers had their personal freedoms illegally deprived to varying degrees: five for 72 days, three for 53 days, three for 15 days, three for 10 days, one for 7 days, and seven for 9 hours.

　　醴陵处理非法拘禁公民事件
    市公安局原副局长被依法提起公诉
    本报长沙２月２６日电  记者吴兴华报道：２月２３日，湖南省醴陵市人民检察院依法对犯有非法拘禁罪的原醴陵市公安局副局长程楚明提起公诉。同日，向犯有非法拘禁罪，但情节轻微的原醴陵市公安局长易达成宣布免予起诉的决定。
    １９８７年４月，醴陵市洪源乡小洞村黄永福、黄永书等村民，为村办鞭炮厂的帐目不清等问题，多次向有关领导机关投诉，要求查处。洪源乡、醴陵市两级政府先后派人查帐，但未向村民公布结果。为此，黄永福、黄永书等村民有意见，并采取了一些过激行为。
    １９８７年８月２１日上午，程楚明等公安干警和联防队员１７人去小洞村，拘传黄永福未成，又任意指使村民黄永全干活。遭拒绝后，一干警扭住黄的手腕，另一联防队员用大号电警棍击黄，引起民愤，出现村民扭扯干警的行为。
    ８月２２日凌晨一时左右，程楚明在公安局原局长易达成召开的会议上汇报情况时，隐瞒了公安干警及联防队员强令村民干活、先动手打人的真实情况，并歪曲事实，提出要拘传黄永福等７人。当日下午３时半，易达成又召集会议，在无任何证据、又未立案的情况下，以破坏集体生产与妨害公务为由决定拘传黄永福等７人。
    于是，１２０余名公安干警和联防队员在易达成、程楚明等人的带领下，分乘１５辆汽车，到达洪源乡明南桥后步行进入小洞村，共抓村民２２人。在这过程中，程楚明殴打、辱骂村民多人。对此，易达成下令将所有被抓人员押送南桥乡政府。待公安干警逐个讯问后，仅凭口供，决定教育、释放７人，收容审查８人。上述被抓的２２名村民，均被不同程度地非法剥夺了人身自由，其中７２天的５人，５３天的３人，１５天的３人，１０天的３人，７天的１人，９小时的７人。
