Title: On Those Like Licorice

Among traditional Chinese medicines, there is one called licorice. The Ben Cao Jing Annotated states: "Licorice is of a neutral nature, with a sweet and bland taste, non-toxic, and harmonizes all medicines..." Generally, the four properties of medicines: ascending, descending, floating, and sinking, all harmonize with licorice. Thus, in the eyes of mediocre doctors, this can be considered the saint of medicines. When diagnosing and treating symptoms of yin and yang, exterior and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess, they often do not omit it, with the most being half a liang (15 grams), and the least being one qian (3 grams). Even more so, when doctors are at a loss with medicines and have no strategy for the disease, they resort to licorice to fulfill their duty. If a patient happens to recover, the credit goes to licorice; if the symptoms worsen, or even if the patient dies, licorice bears no great responsibility. It can enter and exit freely, advance and retreat with ease, a marvel indeed.

However, in the eyes of skilled doctors who can revive the dying, licorice is by no means as favored. Precisely because it is bland, it lacks the ability of Scutellaria and Coptis to expel heart and liver evils; precisely because it is neutral, it lacks the fierce power of Rhizoma Corydalis and Perilla to soften hardness and promote water flow; precisely because it is non-toxic, it has no power to attack evils with poisons. Therefore, it is seen as ordinary, and often not used.

In society, there is a type of person quite similar to licorice. In Jiang Zi Long's short story "Paying New Year's Call," the character Hu Wan Tong is of this type.

Hu has a sweet face and a soft temperament, harmonious and fair, flattering and obsequious; he is unlearned and mediocre, worldly and vulgar, avoiding anything that harms harmony, and staying away from reforms. Workers gave him a review:

"Everywhere the radius of curvature is equal, the coefficient of friction is zero at every point—round and slippery."

Though he "has a dull head, clumsy hands, and was not born to be a blacksmith," he managed to succeed in everything, always smooth and fortunate, and resourceful; while someone like Leng Zhan Guo, who has the courage and wisdom to reform and manage a factory well, often encounters setbacks and obstacles.

Is this strange? No, it is not. This is because reform is a new path, involving all aspects of the economic base and superstructure, and it is bound to touch the interests of some people. Our reformers are not "gods," and it is inevitable that they will make some mistakes in their work. Thus, they often face ridicule and slander, and if someone wants to accuse them, there will be no shortage of words. If we do not focus on the virtues, abilities, diligence, and achievements of the reformers, and look at the main aspects and the big picture, then it is easy to let people like Hu Wan Tong succeed, and let pioneers be tarnished, hindering the great cause of reform.

The economy needs to develop, and China needs to prosper. The urgent task is to adhere to the standard of productive forces, and to rectify and improve the economic order and environment, deepen reforms, and forge ahead. The road is difficult, and the tasks are heavy. Relying on people like Hu Wan Tong, who are like licorice, not only will it be difficult to achieve results, but it will also be detrimental to the cause!

　　且说甘草者流
    王承典
    中药里面有一味叫作甘草的。本草经注：“甘草，平性，味甘淡，无毒，调和诸药……”大凡药之四性：升、降、浮、沉，甘草莫不与之附合。于是在庸医眼里，此可谓药中之圣。凡诊治阴阳表里，寒热虚实之症，每每不肯或缺，多则半两，少则一钱（３克）。甚而尤之，医者于药束手，于病无策，遂付之甘草，敷衍以塞其责。偶遇患者痊愈，功劳当属甘草；倘或症状加剧，乃至人命呜呼，甘草亦无大责。出入自如，进退有地，妙之所在。
    然而在回春之名医眼里，甘草决非受宠如是。唯其淡，故无芩连祛心肝邪盛之能；唯其平，故无川军木通软坚利水之猛；唯其无毒，断无以毒攻毒之力。由是，视若平平，每每弗用。
    人群里有一种颇似甘草者。蒋子龙在他的短篇小说《拜年》里刻划的胡万通即属此类。
    胡氏甜甜的脸子，绵绵的性子，调和公允、阿谀奉迎；不学无术，平庸世俗，伤和气的事躲得远，改革之举不沾边，好事成了他有份，出了麻烦他无缘。工人们送他一纸评语：
    “曲率半径处处相等，磨擦系数点点为零——又圆又滑。”
    别看他“脑瓜子不玲珑，手脚笨得出奇，生来就不是打铁的材料”，然而就凭了深得甘草之三昧，竟一直事事通达，处处春风，左右逢源；而有胆有识，敢于改革，善于治厂的冷占国却屡屡吃“瘪”，步履坎坷。
    怪吗？不怪。这是因为，改革是新路，涉及到经济基础和上层建筑的各个方面，必然会触动某些人的利益，而我们的改革者又都不是“神”，难保在工作中不发生一点失误，于是往往会讥讽沓来，谤妒横生，欲加之罪，词出不穷。如果我们不是着眼于改革者的德、能、勤、绩，看主流，看大节，那就难免让胡万通式的老好人得逞，让开拓者蒙垢，使改革大业受阻。
    经济要发展，中华要振兴，当务之急是要坚持生产力标准，整顿和治理好经济秩序、经济环境，深化改革、开拓前进。道路艰难，任务繁重，靠了胡万通式的甘草者们非但难能奏效，而且会败事有余的呢！
    草成此文。甘草者戒。庸医者戒。
