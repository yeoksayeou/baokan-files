The State Council held its 35th executive meeting on February 17, presided over by Premier Li Peng. The meeting discussed the division of responsibilities between the State Council's relevant departments and national specialized investment companies, and made corresponding decisions.

The meeting noted that in the past, we used administrative methods to allocate investments, with various departments sharing a "big pot," often leading to waste. Last year, the State Council decided to reform the investment management system, establishing six national specialized investment companies in the fields of energy, transportation, raw materials, machinery and textiles, agriculture, and forestry. This reform allows the investment companies and relevant departments to check and balance each other in fixed asset investments, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, thus facilitating the scientific decision-making of projects and improving investment efficiency.

The meeting emphasized that the State Planning Commission should pay attention to coordinating the work between investment companies and departments. Industry-specific departments should transform their functions, focusing on industry management and the formulation of industrial policies, and conducting macro-management. In the near term, investment companies should focus on policy-based investments, accepting supervision from industry-specific departments and guidance from industry development plans.

The meeting discussed and made decisions on issues related to investment plans, project management, and the leadership of investment companies.

Eight people attended this executive meeting, and six were absent with leave.

　　国务院举行常务会议    
    讨论有关部门和投资公司职责划分
    新华社北京２月１８日电  ２月１７日，李鹏总理主持国务院第３５次常务会议，讨论了国务院有关部门与国家专业投资公司的职责划分问题，并作出了相应的决定。
    会议认为，过去我们用行政办法分配投资，各部门吃“大锅饭”，往往造成浪费。去年国务院决定对投资管理体制进行改革，成立了能源、交通、原材料、机电轻纺、农业和林业六个国家专业投资公司。这一改革，使得各投资公司与各有关部门在固定资产投资方面互相制约，取长补短，从而有利于实现项目决策的科学化，提高投资效益。
    会议要求国家计委注意做好投资公司与部门之间的协调工作。各行业归口部门要转变职能，搞好行业管理和产业政策的制订，进行宏观管理。投资公司近期应以政策性投资为主，接受行业归口部门的监督和行业发展规划的指导。
    会议经过讨论，对有关投资计划、项目管理、投资公司的领导关系等问题作出了决定。
    出席这次常务会议的８人，请假的６人。
