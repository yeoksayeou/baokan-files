Recently, during construction work by the Qingdao Railway Repair Section between Xindian and Tai'an, many screws on the railway sleepers had not yet been tightened when they disappeared. It turned out that 25 students from Cuijian, Beiliu, and Dongzhang villages in Linqiu Town, Zibo City, had taken them. The oldest among them is 15 years old, and the youngest is only 6.

These students explained that the school required each student to turn in 5 kilograms of scrap metal. They removed the screws to meet this requirement. Of course, the school's initiative for students to work and save, and to collect scrap metal, is commendable, and the school would not instruct children to go to the railway to "steal." However, within this small area, it is not realistic to require each student to turn in 5 kilograms of scrap metal. As teachers and parents of students in schools along the railway, they should frequently educate their children to protect the railway.

　　学校要求交废铁  学生偷盗谁之过
    近一段时间，青岛铁路大修段在辛店至泰安间的铁路线上施工时，许多枕木上的螺丝还没有来得及紧固，便不翼而飞了。原来，是淄博市临淄区南仇镇崔碾、北流、东张等村的二十五名学生所为，他们中最大的十五岁，最小的仅六岁。
    这些学生说，学校要求每个学生上交废铁五公斤。他们拆卸螺丝是为了完成任务。当然，学校勤工俭学，收缴废铁，无可非议，学校也不会让孩子到铁路上去“揩油”。但是，在这狭小的区域内，让每个学生上交五公斤废铁是不现实的。作为铁路沿线学校的教师和学生家长，应经常教育孩子爱护铁路。
