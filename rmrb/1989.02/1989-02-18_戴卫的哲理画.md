In recent years, some artists have become more concerned with the cultural value and philosophical implications of their works, more consciously pursuing the deeper "meaning beyond the painting" and entering the philosophical realm of thought-provoking art.

Dai Wei, known for his installation art, has been exploring Chinese painting for many years. However, it was only in recent years that he began to create philosophical paintings. As a middle-aged artist with an extraordinary life experience and a rich understanding of human suffering, he has a deep sense of life's experiences and profound reflections on them. Because of this, he is not satisfied with merely serving as a passive carrier for any current cultural concepts or philosophical propositions. He wants to elevate various complex and enriching human insights into art that transcends the self and is filled with historical significance. Thus, his unique philosophical paintings emerged, and from the beginning, they have shown a distinctive style of being rich in emotion and deep in thought, rich in meaning and precise in form.

From works such as "Reunion," "The Sage," and "The Bell," one can see that Dai Wei's philosophical paintings are somewhere between realism and expressionism, seeming to have a narrative yet also seeming to lack one. The characters appear both ancient and modern, both real and illusory. However, he pays great attention to the inner emotions and mental states of the characters, striving to evoke philosophy through intense, heart-stirring experiences that transcend historical and spatial boundaries.

Taking "Reunion" as an example, he depicts characters whose postures and gestures reveal a mix of great joy and great sorrow. But why are the reunited individuals so overwhelmed? What unimaginable tragedies have they experienced? The artist leaves these questions to the viewer. In the case of "The Bell," Dai Wei paints people of various ethnicities and races, showing their bewilderment and anxiety in the face of the awakening bell. Some might think the artist is expressing a sense of crisis, but he clearly depicts these people as standing together like mountains. Is he reminding people that in the face of imminent danger, they should scatter like birds and be destroyed one by one? Or should they stand together, unite their strengths, and face the destructive challenge head-on? Regardless, he is using the language of art to compel viewers to engage in deep reflection and to understand the philosophy the artist has grasped. It is clear that appealing to form, moving with emotion, guiding with thought, and enlightening with reason is the brilliance of Dai Wei's philosophical paintings.

　　戴卫的哲理画
    薛永年
    这几年，一些画家更加关心作品的文化价值和哲学意蕴，更自觉地追求深层的“画外意”，进入启人深思的哲理的画境。
    以装祯艺术家闻名的戴卫，虽从事中国画探索多年，但开始画哲理画，还是近年的事。作为一个经历不凡备尝人间甘苦又不甘放弃初衷的中年艺术家，他有着丰富的人生体验，更有着从切实的人生体验中触发而来的深沉思索。唯其如此，他便不会满意于为任何时下流行的文化观念和哲学命题充当被动的载体，他要把各种复杂的激盈人心又益人心智的人生感悟升华为超越自我并充满了历史感的艺术。于是，他的别具一格的哲理画出现了，并且一开始就初步形成了饶于情而深于理、富于意而精于形的特点。
    从《重逢》、《智者》和《钟声》可以看出，戴卫的哲理画在写实与写意之间，似乎有情节又似乎没有情节，人物则似古而今，似真而幻。不过，他十分注意于人物内在感情与内心世界的开掘，非常着力于在激动人心又超越历史时空的强烈感悟中引发哲理。
    以《重逢》为例，他描写的是由人物的身姿和手势体现出大喜大悲交织为一的人物关系，但何以重逢者如此不能自已？他们经历了什么样的难以设想的人生惨剧？画家把这些问题留给了观者。再以《钟声》为例，戴卫画的是各民族各种族的人们面对着令人猛醒的钟声所呈现的惶惑不安，也许有人以为作者表现的是一种忧患意识，可是，他分明把这些人处理成并立于兹的山岳；他是否在提醒人们，是在行将灭顶的严重危机面前作鸟雀散以致逐一灭亡？还是并肩合力众志成城地迎击毁灭性的挑战？不管是否如此，总归他是在以艺术的语言迫使观者去进行深沉的思索，去领会作者所悟及的哲理。不难看出，诉诸于形、动之以情、导之以思、晓之以理正是戴卫哲理画的高明之处。
