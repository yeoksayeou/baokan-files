According to the United Nations' population statistics released at the end of 1988, the world population in 1988 had already exceeded 5.1 billion, an increase of 1.7% compared to 1987. If this rate of growth continues, then in ten years—by 1998—the world population will surpass 6 billion. By the year 2000, it will reach 6.25 billion, and by 2025, it may reach 8.4665 billion.

The report titled "Population Statistics and Future Projections" provides a set of comparative data: compared to 1987, the population growth rate in industrialized countries was only 0.5%, while in developing countries, it was 2.1%. Currently, the average life expectancy worldwide is 61 years. In industrialized countries, it is 73 years, while in developing countries, it is only 60 years.

　　十年后，世界人口将超过六十亿
    据联合国１９８８年底公布的世界人口统计数字表明，１９８８年的世界人口已超过５１亿，比１９８７年增加了１．７％。如果按此速度发展，那么十年后——１９９８年世界人口将突破６０亿，而２０００年将达到６２．５亿人，２０２５年可达到８４．６６５０亿人。
    这份《关于人口统计和今后预测报告书》提供了一组对比数据：与１９８７年相比，工业先进国家的人口增长仅为０．５％，而发展中国家的增长率为２．１％。目前世界人口平均寿命为６１岁。其中工业先进国家为７３岁，发展中国家仅为６０岁。
