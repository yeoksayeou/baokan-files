The Shanxi Provincial Government has established a system for collecting suggestions from the people, which has received enthusiastic support from various sectors of society over the past year, achieving good results in building socialist democratic politics.

As of January 10, the Shanxi Provincial Government has received over 2,200 suggestions from experts, scholars, workers, peasants, cadres, people's representatives, members of the Political Consultative Conference, and retired cadres. Of these, over 1,800 have been adopted or referenced by the provincial government and relevant departments. The Shanxi Daily has opened a "Letter to the Government" column, publishing more than 20 suggestions. Over 200 suggestions have attracted the attention of the provincial government and National People's Congress leaders, who have promptly responded and adopted them. Senior engineer of the Forestry Department, Mr. Zhān Zhāoníng, suggested establishing a responsibility system for afforestation and greening at all levels of government. Governor Wáng Shēnhào has issued instructions twice, directing the Provincial Forestry Bureau to adopt and implement this suggestion. A forestry reform plan, primarily based on the term-of-office responsibility system, has been drafted and will soon be submitted to the Provincial Government's Standing Committee for review. The Xiaocheng County Letters and Visits Office, in response to the frequent disputes over rural contract management, proposed drafting a regulation to handle such disputes. This suggestion has been noted by Deputy Governor Guó Yùhuái, and a draft regulation has been prepared by the Provincial Legal Affairs Bureau in collaboration with relevant departments. Senior engineer and Director of the Science and Technology Committee of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Zhuāng Guóshēn, proposed nine suggestions on scientific and technological issues related to revitalizing Shanxi's economy while on his sickbed. These suggestions have been adopted by the provincial government. Mr. Wáng Xiùqīng, a cadre from Xiyang County, suggested that leading cadres should not rely solely on local leaders' reports during inspections but should instead widely consult with the masses to understand the situation. This suggestion has been re-emphasized by the provincial government and is now being implemented.

The Shanxi Provincial Government has opened its doors to criticism and widely solicited public opinion, making the government's major decisions more scientific and democratic. Every suggestion received from the public has a response, and every letter receives an answer. The pursuit of practical results, rather than empty fame, ensures that this work truly achieves the effect of the leading organs listening to the people's voices.

　　山西省政府征集群众建议二千余件
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：山西省人民政府建立征集人民群众建议制度，一年来得到社会各界群众的热情支持，为建设社会主义民主政治取得良好效果。
    截至１月１０日，山西省政府已收到专家、学者、工人、农民、干部、人民代表、政协委员、离（退）休干部送来的建议２２００余件，已有１８００余件被省政府及有关部门采纳或参考。山西日报开辟“议政信函”专栏，已刊登建议２０多件。有２００多件建议引起省政府、省人大主要领导同志重视，并及时批示、采纳实施。林业部高级工程师詹昭宁关于建立各级政府造林绿化责任制的建议，王森浩省长两次批示，责成省林业厅采纳实施。现已起草一个以各级政府任期责任制为主要内容的林业改革方案，即将提请省政府常务会研究。交城县信访局针对农村承包合同纠纷多的情况，建议制定一个处理农村承包合同纠纷的法规，这一建议引起郭裕怀副省长重视，已由省法制局会同有关部门拟定一项法规草案。高级工程师、省政协科技工作委员会主任庄国绅，在病床上就有关振兴山西经济的科技问题，提出９项建议，被省政府采纳。昔阳县干部王秀清建议领导干部下去视察工作不能只听当地领导干部汇报，要广泛接触群众了解情况，这一建议再次提醒省政府领导，并已在实行。
    山西省政府开门纳谏，广征民意，使省政府的重大决策更具有科学性民主性。凡征集到的群众建议，件件有着落，信信有答复。追求实效，不图虚名，使这一工作真正收到领导机关倾听民意的效果。
