In yesterday's parliamentary session, Prime Minister Takeshita responded to opposition parties' questions regarding the responsibility and nature of World War II by stating: "The declaration of war in the last war was issued under the advice of the cabinet ministers. Whether it was an aggressive war should be evaluated by future historians."

Additionally, it was reported that Yajiro Muramatsu, the Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, responded to questions about the war responsibility of Emperor Showa in the parliament yesterday. He stated that, according to both domestic and international law, Emperor Showa bears no responsibility for the war. Local media believe this is the first time the Japanese government has explicitly stated that Emperor Showa is not responsible for the war.

    本报东京２月１５日电  记者于青报道：在昨天的国会上，竹下首相回答在野党关于第二次世界大战的责任和性质的质询时说：“上次大战的宣战布告是在国务大臣的辅弼下发布的。是不是侵略战争，应该由后世历史学家来评价。”
    另据报道，日本内阁法制局长官味村治昨天在国会就昭和天皇战争责任问题进行答辩时说，无论是根据国内法，还是国际法，昭和天皇对战争不负有任何责任。此间报界认为，这是日本政府第一次表明昭和天皇不负有战争责任的见解。
