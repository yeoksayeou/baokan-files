Many Tianjin residents are no longer satisfied with just abundant food and fashionable clothing; the rise of family cultural activities has brought more joy to an increasing number of households.

Tianjin's family cultural activities began in 1986. Many families, based on their own conditions and interests, frequently organize singing performances, story-telling sessions, get-togethers, and game competitions. The activities cover a wide range of topics including drama, music, folk arts, dance, calligraphy, painting, photography, horticulture, breeding, and clothing design and making.

To promote family cultural activities, many district-level cultural departments have held family cultural competitions. Participants include extended families, couples performing together, sisters-in-law singing duets, and mothers-in-law dancing with daughters-in-law. In the Hedong District, 74-year-old retired teacher Dou Wencong's family of 25 members has been organizing family cultural activities for three years. Every other Sunday, the grandchildren gather at the elderly's residence to sing, dance, and enjoy family time. They also recite poetry, paint, and practice calligraphy. This family has participated in the district's family cultural competitions for three consecutive years and has won multiple awards.

According to Tianjin's cultural department, out of the city's more than 1 million households, about half are engaged in family cultural activities. This self-entertaining family culture has helped Tianjin residents gradually establish a scientific, civilized, and healthy lifestyle.

Vice Minister of Culture Gao Zhanxiang, after inspecting Tianjin's family cultural activities, gave high praise. He believes that the family is the basic unit of society, and the rise of family culture is a sign of social cultural development.

　　生活改善之后追求艺术享受
    天津５０万户居民开展家庭文化活动
    据新华社天津电  （记者张淑英、窦合义）许多天津人现在已不满足丰盛的佳肴，以及讲究的穿着等物质享受了，家庭文化活动的兴起给越来越多的家庭带来了更多的乐趣。
    天津家庭文化活动是从１９８６年开始的。许多家庭根据各自的条件和爱好，经常举办演唱会、故事会、联欢会、游艺比赛等活动。内容涉及戏剧、音乐、曲艺、舞蹈、书法、绘画、摄影、花卉、养殖、服装设计制做等。
    为了促进家庭文化活动的开展，市区许多群众文化工作部门多次举办家庭文化大奖赛。参加比赛的有四世同堂的大家庭，有夫妻、父女同台表演，姑嫂对唱，婆媳共舞等。河东区７４岁的退休教师窦文淙一家２５口人，３年前就开始组织家庭文化活动。每隔一周的周日，儿孙们便在老人住地聚会，或唱歌跳舞，尽享天伦之乐。或朗诵诗歌，或绘画练书法，这家人曾连续３次参加区里举办的家庭文化比赛，并多次获奖。
    据天津市群众文化工作部门介绍，目前全市１００多万户居民中，开展家庭文化活动的约占一半。这种以自娱为主的家庭文化的兴起，使天津人逐步建立起科学、文明、健康的生活方式。
    文化部副部长高占祥在考察天津开展家庭文化活动情况后，给予高度评价。他认为，家庭是社会的细胞，家庭文化的兴起是社会文化发展的标志。
