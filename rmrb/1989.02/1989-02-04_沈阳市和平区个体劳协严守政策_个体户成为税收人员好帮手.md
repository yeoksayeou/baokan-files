The individual labor cooperative in Shenyang's Heping District has, over the past two years, actively cooperated with the tax authorities, assisting tax collectors in propagating tax laws and collecting taxes, thus becoming good assistants to the tax collectors.

The Nan Station Wholesale Market is where the individual labor cooperative is located. In this market, some vendors often conduct transactions after tax collectors have gone off duty, evading a large amount of taxes. After learning of this situation, members of the individual labor cooperative notified the market gatekeepers not to let vendors who have not paid taxes pass through. Once, a vendor sold 60,000 kilograms of fresh peaches after the tax collectors had gone off duty. Upon learning of this, the individual labor cooperative immediately sent someone to collect the tax according to regulations, amounting to 470 yuan. In 1988, they collected and withheld a total of 50,000 yuan in taxes.

The 40 members of this district's individual labor cooperative are all individual householders. They are familiar with market conditions and proficient in their business, fully aware of some vendors' tax evasion tactics. Last June, a merchant from Shandong Province brought in a large truckload of pears. He told the tax collectors that the truck had only 3,000 kilograms of pears. Members of the individual labor cooperative, based on their own experience, immediately saw that the reported quantity was inaccurate. After re-examining, the merchant admitted to underreporting by 3,000 kilograms and paid an additional 650 yuan in taxes.

### 沈阳市和平区个体劳协严守政策　个体户成为税收人员好帮手

　　沈阳市和平区个体劳协严守政策
　　个体户成为税收人员好帮手
    沈阳市和平区个体劳动者协会近两年来主动配合税务部门工作，协助税收人员宣传税法，代征税款，成为税收人员的好帮手。
    南站批发市场是和平区个体劳协所在地。在这个批发市场上，常常有些商贩乘税收人员下班后进行交易，逃漏大量税款。个体劳协会员掌握这一情况后，通知市场大门门卫，对没有交税的商贩不准放行。一次，一个商贩趁税务人员下班后卖出了６万公斤鲜桃。个体劳协得知此事后立即派人按章征收税款４７０元。１９８８年，他们代征代扣的税款达５万元之多。
    这个区个体劳协的４０个成员都是个体户，他们行情熟，业务精，深知一些商贩的偷漏税手段。去年６月，山东省一货主拉来一大车梨，他对税务人员说，这车梨只有３０００公斤。个体劳协成员根据自己的经验，一眼就看出申报数量不实，经重新查证，货主承认少报了３０００公斤，补税６５０元。
