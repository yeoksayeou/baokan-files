This morning, 30 students from the National Training Class for Teachers of the Mentally Handicapped at Beijing Normal University sat with great interest in the broadcast studio of the Institute of Modern Educational Technology. They watched as Professor Lin Wen from New York University, an expert in educational psychology, delivered a lecture from the Carter Center in Atlanta, across the Pacific. This long-distance teaching was conducted using a PC-based distance education system.

The students were able to see and hear the professor clearly through the use of advanced technology. The professor's lecture was interactive, allowing the students to ask questions and receive immediate responses. This innovative approach to education is part of a broader effort to improve the quality of special education in China.

The training class is one of several initiatives aimed at enhancing the skills of special education teachers in China. The program is designed to provide teachers with the latest knowledge and techniques in special education, with a focus on practical applications. The use of distance learning technology allows for greater flexibility and accessibility, enabling teachers from different regions to participate in the training.

The collaboration between Chinese and American educators is a significant step forward in the development of special education in China. By leveraging the expertise of international experts and advanced technology, the program aims to create a more inclusive and supportive educational environment for students with special needs.

The students expressed their enthusiasm for the program, highlighting the value of learning from international experts and the convenience of distance learning. They noted that the interactive nature of the lectures made the learning experience more engaging and effective.

This initiative is part of a broader effort to improve the quality of education in China, with a particular focus on special education. The use of distance learning technology and international collaboration is seen as a key strategy for achieving this goal. The program is expected to have a positive impact on the development of special education in China, providing teachers with the skills and knowledge they need to support students with special needs.
