A new type of microcomputer-controlled pulse-modulated medium-frequency electrotherapy machine, which combines traditional Chinese medicine's moist heat therapy with electrical stimulation, recently underwent a product technical appraisal in Beijing.

Experts, based on clinical efficacy analyses from over 10,000 cases provided by Beijing Friendship Hospital, Jishuitan Hospital, and Xuanwu Hospital, confirmed that this comprehensive treatment device has the effects of improving tissue function, relaxing spasms, reducing inflammation, and relieving pain. It has a total effective rate of 93.5% for conditions such as acute contusions, various types of arthritis, periarthritis of the shoulder, neuralgia, and expelling stones.

This safe, comfortable, and fast-acting new type of medium-frequency electrotherapy machine is suitable for use in medical institutions at all levels in both urban and rural areas, as well as in general households.
