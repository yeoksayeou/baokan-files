A veteran journalist and founder of the *Xinmin Daily*, Chen Mingde, has completed his life journey.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 22nd, the family of Chen Mingde, a veteran journalist and founder of the *Xinmin Daily*, quietly placed his ashes in Room 1 of the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery in Babaoshan this afternoon. In front of the urn were two bouquets of flowers: one was a silk bouquet from his relatives, and the other was a fresh bouquet from the Central Committee of the China Democratic Revolutionary Party.

Chen Mingde passed away in Beijing on February 11th due to illness, at the age of 92. This veteran journalist left a will in his final moments: "Donate the body for medical research, do not hold a funeral, and do not hold a memorial service." His wife, Deng Jixian, and relatives, along with relevant organizations, respected the old man's wishes.

Before his passing, Chen was a member of the Standing Committee of the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the China Democratic Revolutionary Party, and advisor to the *Xinmin Evening News* in Shanghai.

Chen Mingde, born in Changshou County, Sichuan Province, began his career as a journalist in the early 1920s. In 1929, he initiated the founding of the *Xinmin Daily*, which gained attention for its innovative layout, distinctive articles, and clear stance against Japanese aggression. During this period, Chen pursued progress and became a close friend of the Communist Party of China. On the first anniversary of the July 7th Incident, Comrade Zhou Enlai personally inscribed a message for the *Xinmin Daily*: "National Unity, Prolonged Struggle. Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in Nation-Building."

Chen Mingde and his wife, Deng Jixian, worked tirelessly under extremely difficult conditions to establish the newspaper. A group of outstanding talents and famous progressive writers became long-term contributors and editors of the *Xinmin Daily*. Under his leadership, the *Xinmin Daily* took on the mission of reflecting the suffering of the people, advocating for democracy, supporting progressive student movements, and dedicating many pages to the hardships of people's lives, exposing the darkness of the old society, and making the *Xinmin Daily* one of the most influential newspapers in the rear areas.

After the founding of New China, Chen dedicated himself to socialist construction and the patriotic united front work. Even in adverse circumstances, he maintained a calm and steadfast belief.

In a notice issued today, the General Office of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference described Chen Mingde as a "famous patriot and democrat, a social activist, and a loyal friend of the Communist Party of China," in recognition of his lifelong achievements.

　　报坛耕耘　一生追求进步  丧事从简　更见高风亮节
    老报人陈铭德走完人生历程
    据新华社北京２月２２日电  中国老一辈报业巨子、《新民报》创始人陈铭德先生的家人，今天下午静静地将他的骨灰安放到八宝山革命公墓骨灰堂一室。骨灰盒前有两束小花：一束是他的亲属献的绢花，一束是民革中央献的鲜花。
    陈铭德先生是今年２月１１日因病在北京逝世的，终年９２岁。这位报界前辈在弥留之际留下遗言：“将遗体捐献，供医学研究，不搞遗体告别仪式，不开追悼会。”他的老伴邓季惺和亲属，有关组织，遵循了这位老人的遗愿。
    陈铭德老人生前是七届全国政协常委、民革中央监察委员会副主席、上海《新民晚报》顾问。
    出生于四川省长寿县的陈铭德先生在２０年代初叶便开始了新闻记者的生涯。１９２９年他发起创办的《新民报》以版面新颖、文章富有特色和鲜明的对日抗战的态度，引起读者的注意。在此期间，陈先生不断追求进步，成为中国共产党的挚友。在“七七”事变１周年时，周恩来同志为《新民报》亲笔题词：“全民团结，持久斗争。抗战必胜，建国必成。”
    陈铭德先生和夫人邓季惺在十分困难的条件下，呕心沥血，艰苦创业。一批优秀的人才，一批著名的进步作家，成了《新民报》的长期撰稿人和版面主编。在他的主持下，《新民报》以反映民间疾苦，争取民主为己任，支持进步学生运动，并用很多篇幅反映人民生活的苦难，揭露了旧社会的黑暗，使《新民报》成为大后方有较大影响的报纸。
    新中国成立后，陈先生全力投身于社会主义建设和爱国统一战线工作，即使在身处逆境时，他仍保持着坦然而坚定执著的信念。
    全国政协办公厅在今天发出的讣告中用“著名的爱国民主人士、社会活动家，中国共产党的忠诚的朋友”，作为对陈铭德先生一生功绩的评价。
