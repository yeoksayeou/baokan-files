After receiving a report about the rampant illegal fishing of eel fry in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the night shift editors of this newspaper immediately conducted a telephone interview with relevant officials from the Ministry of Agriculture. They unanimously pointed out that such behavior, which destroys resources and domestic fishery production, completely violates national and local regulations and must be resolutely stopped.

Li Wanlu (Deputy Director of the Fisheries Administration Bureau): Eel fry is a precious fish species in our country and should be strictly protected. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian have clearly stipulated that the fishing, purchasing, exporting, and transporting of eel fry all require permits. In recent years, some units, in pursuit of "high efficiency," raise prices during the eel fry migration season and buy in large quantities for export. This has led some people, blinded by money, to disregard regulations and engage in rampant fishing. We support the newspaper's public disclosure of this matter. It is very necessary for the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Nantong Municipal Government to take measures to stop illegal fishing.

Feng Ruifeng (Director of the Fisheries Administration Office): Currently, in some places, the purchasing price of eel fry is as high as 10,000 yuan per kilogram, making fisheries management very difficult. This requires relevant departments to strengthen coordination, strictly implement the permit system, and resolutely shut down illegal fishing and purchasing activities.

She Dashu (Director of the Fisheries Bureau): The state's guiding principle for developing eel production is to focus on domestic breeding and to export fewer or no fry. One kilogram of eel fry can produce one ton of adult eels, and exporting them after breeding is more profitable than selling the fry. The current rampant fishing is destroying resources, affecting domestic production, and causing significant losses to the country. We hope that all localities will stop price hikes and panic buying, and crack down on smuggling activities.

　　农业部有关部门负责人发表谈话    
    非法捕捞鳗鱼苗必须制止
    本报北京２月１９日讯  接到长江下游鳗鱼苗遭到狂捞滥捕的电讯后，本报夜班编辑立即电话采访了农业部有关方面负责同志。他们一致指出：这种破坏资源、破坏国内渔业生产的行为完全违反了国家和地方有关规定，必须坚决制止。
    李万禄（渔政局副局长）：鳗鱼苗是我国的一种珍贵鱼苗，应当严加保护。江苏、浙江、福建等省明确规定，捕捞、收购、出口、运输鳗鱼苗都要有许可证。近二三年，有些单位为了追求“高效益”，每到鳗鱼苗回游季节就抬价收购，大量出口。使那些见钱眼开的人，无视法规，狂捞滥捕。我们赞成报纸公开披露此事。江苏省和南通市政府采取措施制止非法捕捞是十分必要的。
    冯瑞峰（渔政处处长）：现在有些地方收购鳗鱼苗价格高达１公斤１万多元，渔政管理十分困难。这需要有关部门加强协调，严格执行许可证制度，对无证捕捞、收购者坚决取缔。
    佘大奴（水产局局长）：发展鳗鱼生产，国家的指导方针是立足国内养殖，少出或不出口鱼苗。１公斤鳗鱼苗可养１吨成鳗，养成后出口比卖鱼苗要合算。现在这种狂捞滥捕，破坏资源，影响国内生产，给国家造成很大损失。希望各地制止抬价抢购，打击走私活动。
