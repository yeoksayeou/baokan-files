Qian Qichen, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated today that China supports and strives to promote the early convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Middle East problem.

In the morning, he held talks with Farouk Kadoumi, the Head of the PLO Political Department, emphasizing that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China is willing to make positive contributions to the promotion of the Middle East peace process.

He said that the PLO and Arab countries have proposed reasonable, realistic, and flexible proposals and suggestions for the political resolution of the Middle East problem in the past year, which have been widely welcomed by the international community and public opinion.

Kadoumi introduced in detail the situation in the Middle East and the series of proactive measures taken by the PLO for the struggle of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories against Israeli occupation and for the peaceful resolution of the Middle East problem.

He said that in order to adapt to the new situation in the Middle East region, the relevant parties should adjust their respective policies. In order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, the conflicting parties, including Arab countries, Palestine, and Israel, should, on the basis of ensuring the balance of interests of all parties, guarantee the national independence and rights of the Palestinian people and the right of all parties to live in peace and stability, based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338.

　　钱其琛与巴解组织政治部主任会谈
    新华社北京２月１４日电  外交部长钱其琛今天说，中国支持并努力推动早日召开联合国主持下的中东和平国际会议，以实现中东问题的全面、公正和持久的解决。
    他在上午与巴解组织政治部主任法鲁克·卡杜米举行会谈时强调，中国作为联合国安理会常任理事国，愿为推动中东和平进程作出积极贡献。
    他说，巴解组织和阿拉伯国家在过去一年里为了政治解决中东问题不时提出合理、现实、灵活的主张和建议，得到了国际社会和舆论的普遍欢迎。
    卡杜米详细介绍自被占领土巴勒斯坦人民开展反对以色列占领的斗争以来的中东形势和巴解组织为争取巴勒斯坦的民族权利和中东问题的和平解决而采取的一系列主动行动。
    他说，为了适应中东地区的新形势，有关各方应调整各自的政策。为了在中东实现公正全面的和平，冲突各方，包括阿拉伯国家、巴勒斯坦和以色列，应在联合国２４２、３３８号决议的基础上，在保证各方利益均衡的基础上，保障巴勒斯坦人民的民族独立和权利和各方安定生活的权利。
