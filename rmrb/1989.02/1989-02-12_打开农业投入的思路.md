	Expanding the Pathways for Agricultural Investment
	Xinhua News Agency reporters: Wang Yi, Yang Li, Xu Bo

	As people have come to realize the urgency of increasing agricultural investment and are determined to do so as soon as possible, a "shadow" accompanies this realization: the scarcity of funds and agricultural materials makes it difficult to increase agricultural investment.

	Sichuan, this major agricultural province, is tackling this issue with what kind of approach?

	Vertical Investment + Horizontal Investment

	In Sichuan, the shortage of investment is almost ubiquitous, and the demand for agricultural inputs is enormous:

	In Leshan, Guangyuan, and eight other grain-producing regions, the supply of plastic film meets only one-third of the demand;
	In Chengdu, Deyang, and seven other prefecture-level cities, the supply of pesticides meets only half of the demand;
	In the "Rain City" of Ya'an, which is prone to insect disasters, 500 tons of pesticides are urgently needed, but currently, there is almost no stock;
	In Neijiang, Panzhihua, and six other prefecture-level cities, more than 60% of the paddy fields and dry fields urgently need fertilizer but have none to apply…

	The decision-makers in Sichuan Province believe that one of the main reasons for the shortage of agricultural investment is that during the transition from the old to the new system, the government's ability to invest in agriculture through the vertical allocation method is weakening, while the new horizontal investment mechanism relying on society to operate agriculture has not yet been formed. To solve the current agricultural investment problem, it is necessary to combine vertical and horizontal investments, addressing both immediate and root causes.

	Following this approach, Sichuan, on the one hand, strengthens vertical investment to alleviate current contradictions. Despite financial difficulties, it has decided to allocate an additional 20 million yuan for agriculture this year, use all 100 million cubic meters of newly produced natural gas for fertilizer production, and allocate $12 million from last year's foreign exchange earnings to import urgently needed agricultural materials such as plastic film.

	On the other hand, it encourages horizontal investment. For enterprises or individuals investing in agriculture and engaging in agricultural product compensatory trade, the government opens the green light and acts as a matchmaker, promoting more urban funds to flow into rural areas. Currently, in Chengdu, Leshan, and other places, this type of horizontal investment between industry and agriculture, commerce and agriculture, and urban residents and agriculture is taking shape. According to statistics from Leshan City alone, more than 10 million yuan of urban funds have been used to develop agriculture.

	The government strongly advocates for the establishment of "cooperative funds" by the people to raise agricultural funds, respects their autonomy, and protects their legal interests. Such "funds" are developing rapidly across the province, with a total raised amount of over 130 million yuan, of which more than 70 million yuan has been invested in agriculture, equivalent to nearly three years of new agricultural investment by Sichuan's financial department.

	High-Efficiency Investment > Low-Efficiency Investment

	Sichuan Provincial Party Secretary Yang Ruidai once calculated the "oil cake account" as follows: Due to the shortage of chemical fertilizers, Sichuan had to use oil cake, which is relatively low-priced on the international market, to exchange foreign currency and then use the foreign currency to purchase chemical fertilizers. In fact, this is not cost-effective. The fertilizer effect of oil cake can last for three to four years, while chemical fertilizer needs to be applied every year; oil cake is also good feed for pigs, and after selling it at a low price, high-priced corn from other places has to be bought back as feed. Yang Ruidai said that ignoring the benefits of agricultural investment is a relatively common phenomenon.

	Some county magistrates and party secretaries said that to increase grain production, a lot of money was spent on land reclamation and expansion, but in the existing cultivated land, 70% is still medium- and low-yield land. If these fields can be transformed into medium- and high-yield fields, only a small amount of investment is needed to increase grain production by hundreds of billions of kilograms each year. Everyone agrees that the benefits of investment must be highly valued, and in times of limited resources, the limited funds and materials must be used effectively. Therefore, Sichuan this year particularly emphasizes avoiding low-efficiency investment to the greatest extent possible, and has taken corresponding measures for some obviously low-efficiency investment behaviors that currently exist: Starting now, immediately stop the export of oil cake and return it to the farmers; focus on medium- and low-yield fields, concentrate funds and materials, and first transform 700,000 mu.

	Tangible Investment and Intangible Investment in Parallel

	In addition to increasing the input of production materials, this type of "tangible investment," the thinking of Sichuan people continues, considering the provincial situation and another type of investment that can go hand in hand with tangible investment—"intangible investment."

	Sichuan has a large population, accounting for 1/10 of the national total, but little land, with cultivated land accounting for 1/16 of the national total; the already large population is increasing by 2 million each year, and the already small cultivated land is decreasing by more than 500,000 mu each year. Facing the reality, the decision-makers in Sichuan Province link population, cultivated land, and agricultural investment together for comprehensive consideration and draw the following conclusion: Plugging the two major "leaks" of population increase and land decrease is equivalent to adding a huge investment to agriculture. For this purpose, Sichuan recently took two measures:

	Establish a provincial land supervision agency to supervise the implementation of the Land Law and focus on investigating and dealing with a number of serious cases of encroaching on cultivated land.

	The 42 main responsible persons of 21 prefectures, cities, and states in the province signed "military orders" and "family planning responsibility books" with Governor Zhang Haoruo, respectively, promising that the population growth in each place would not exceed the control index, and by the end of this century, the total population of the province would not exceed 120 million.

	Starting from the provincial situation to expand the thinking, people also saw another intangible investment that cannot be ignored, that is, the enthusiasm of 80 million farmers. The province explicitly proposed that all levels of government, relevant departments, and a large number of cadres must deepen their understanding of the fundamental role of agriculture, do everything possible to do a good job in various services for agriculture and farmers, and strictly prohibit any harm to agriculture and farmers; if any occurs, it must be corrected and dealt with seriously. For example:

	—Immediately prohibit the practice of forcing down the price of pigs. The government's protection price is the baseline, allowing it to float upwards but not downwards, and violators will be investigated.

	—Farmers must purchase fertilizers, which must be delivered to them by the factory in full. If farmers have to transport it themselves, the factory must bear the cost.

	—Party cadres must go deep into the grassroots and among the farmers, tell them the truth, do practical things, and solve practical problems. The performance of cadres will be assessed based on the evaluation of farmers.

	The demand for agriculture is enormous, and the shortage is a "shadow," but it is also an opportunity. It forces people to give agriculture new impetus with a new investment concept.

### 打开农业投入的思路

　　打开农业投入的思路
    新华社记者  王毅  杨力  徐波
    当人们已经认识到增加农业投入的紧迫性，并决心尽快增加投入时，一个“阴影”却相伴而来：资金、农用物资等短缺的现实，使增加农业投入这篇文章很不好做了。
    四川，这个农业大省，是以什么样的思路做这篇文章呢？
    　　　　纵向投入＋横向投入
    在四川，投入短缺的现象几乎随处可见，农业需求的“胃口”很大：
    乐山、广元等八个产粮地区，农膜的供应量只足需求量的１／３；
    成都、德阳等７个地市，农药的供应只能保证需求的一半；
    “雨城”雅安是个易发虫灾的地区，急需农药５００吨左右，但眼下却基本没有库存；
    内江、攀枝花等六地市，急待施肥却无肥可施的水田旱地竟占到６０％以上……
    四川省的决策者们认为，农业投入短缺的重要原因之一，是在新旧体制转轨期间，政府对农业以配给方式纵向投入的能力开始减弱，而新型的靠社会办农业的横向投入机制尚未形成。当前要解决好农业投入问题，就必须纵向与横向投入相结合，治标治本双管齐下。
    缘着这一思路，四川一方面强化纵向投入以缓解当前矛盾，在财政困难的情况下，仍然决定：今年财政增拨２０００万元投入农业，新增产的１亿立方米天然气全部用于化肥生产，从去年外汇收入中拿出１２００万美元，进口农膜等急需的农用生产资料。
    另一方面鼓励横向投入，对于一些企业或个人向农业投资，开展农产品补偿贸易，政府大开绿灯，并牵线搭桥，促使更多的城市资金流向农村。目前，成都、乐山等地，这种工与农、商与农、城市居民个人与农之间的横向投入初具规模。仅据乐山市的统计，已有１０００余万元城市资金用于发展农业。
    政府大力倡导为筹集农用资金而建立的民间性“合作基金会”，尊重其自主权，保护其合法利益。全川这种“基金会”发展迅速，筹资总额已达１．３亿多元，其中已有７０００多万元投向农业，相当于四川财政近三年新增农业投资的总数。
    　　　　高效投入＞低效投入
    四川省委书记杨汝岱曾算过这样一笔“油枯（即饼粕）账”：由于化肥不足，四川只得用在国际市场价格较低的油枯去换外汇，再用外汇购买化肥。其实，这样做是很不合算的。油枯的肥效能管三、四年，而化肥则需年年都施；油枯还是喂猪的好饲料，低价卖掉后，又不得不从外地买回高价玉米作饲料。杨汝岱说，忽视农业投入的效益，是一个较为普遍的现象。
    一些县长、书记们说为了增加粮食产量，开荒扩地花了不少钱，而在现有耕地中，还有７０％是中低产田。若能把这些田改造为中高产田，只需不多的投资就可每年增产粮食上百亿公斤。大家认为——必须十分重视投入的效益，在家底不殷实的情况下，更应使用好有限的资金和物资。因此，四川今年特别强调最大限度地避免低效投入，对当前明显存在的一些低效投入行为，作出了相应对策：从现在开始，立即终止油枯出口，返还给农民；眼睛盯着中低产田，抓紧集中资金和物资，先改造７０万亩。
    　　　　有形投入与无形投入并重
    增加农业投入，除了增加生产资料这类“有形投入”之外，四川人的思路还在延续，想到了省情，想到了与有形投入并行不悖的另一种投入——“无形投入”。
    四川人多，为全国的１／１０，地少，耕地占全国的１／１６；本来就多的人口每年还在以２００万的数量继续增多，本来就少的耕地每年又在以５０多万亩的数量继续减少。面对现实，四川省的决策者们把人口、耕地与农业的投入联系起来通盘考虑，得出了这样的结论：堵住人增地减两大“漏洞”，就等于给农业增加了一笔巨大的投入，为此，四川最近采取了两项措施：
    建立全省土地监察机构，以监督《土地法》的执行，并对一批严重侵占耕地的案件进行重点查处。
    全省２１个地、市、州的４２位主要负责人，分别向省长张皓若立下“军令状”，签订“计划生育责任书”，保证各地人口增长不得超过控制指标，到本世纪末全省人口不得突破１．２亿。
    从省情出发拓展思路，人们还看到了另一个不可忽视的“无形投入”，那就是８０００万农民的积极性。省里明确提出，各级政府、有关部门和广大干部必须深化对农业基础地位认识，千方百计做好为农业、农民服务的各项工作，不允许损农、坑农事件发生；如有发生，坚决纠正，严肃处理。如：
    ——立即禁止压价收猪。以政府的保护价格为基线，允许上浮，但不准下压，违者必究。
    ——农民购买化肥必须由工厂如数送到，如果农民自运，费用由工厂承担。
    ——党的干部必须深入基层，到农民中去，对他们讲实话办实事，解决实际问题。干部的政绩，将依据农民的评估进行考核。
    农业的需求是巨大的，短缺是“阴影”，但更是契机，它逼着人们以新的投入观给农业以动力。
