The technology for net cage culture of Nile tilapia in reservoirs and wintering breeding using hot springs in Gu Cheng County, Hubei Province, has been successfully researched for the first time in the country.

The Nile tilapia grows rapidly, has a high yield, and good meat quality, making it suitable for intensive net cage farming. However, this species cannot naturally overwinter in China, which has limited its development and reservoir net cage farming. The Gu Cheng County Water Resources Bureau, in collaboration with the provincial fisheries research institute, utilized the hot springs in the county's Wenping area and the Nanhe Reservoir to conduct research on reservoir net cage farming of Nile tilapia and wintering breeding technology using hot springs, successfully solving this problem.

Over the past five years, they have used 7.38 mu of hot spring water to cultivate 383,300 overwintering Nile tilapia, breeding 8.8 million fingerlings and 653,000 large-sized fish. With the availability of fish seeds, the Gu Cheng County Water Resources Bureau has initiated reservoir net cage farming of Nile tilapia. Last year, they produced 8,007.5 kilograms of fish in 196 square meters of net cages, achieving the integration of large-sized fish cultivation in hot spring ponds and reservoir net cage farming of market-sized fish.

　　谷城县水库网箱养殖罗非鱼    
    温泉越冬育种配套技术成熟
    本报讯  湖北省谷城县水库网箱养殖罗非鱼及温泉越冬育种配套技术，首次在国内研究成功。
    尼罗罗非鱼生长快，产量高，肉质好，适宜集约式网箱密养，是农民发展养鱼的优良品种。但是，这种鱼在我国还不能自然越冬，限制了开发和水库网箱养殖。谷城县水利局在省水产研究所的配合下，利用本县温坪温泉水和南河水库，进行水库网箱养殖罗非鱼及温泉越冬育种配套技术研究，终于解决了这个难题。
    ５年来，他们利用７．３８亩温泉培育越冬罗非鱼３８．３３万尾，繁殖鱼苗８８０万尾，育成大规格鱼种６５．３万尾。有了鱼种，谷城县水利局又开展水库网箱养殖罗非鱼。去年，他们在１９６平方米的网箱里产鱼８００７．５公斤，实现了温泉鱼池培育罗非鱼大鱼种与水库网箱养殖成鱼配套。　（帅瑜）
