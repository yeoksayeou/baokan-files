	Grasp Both Propaganda and Rectification
	Black Dragon River's Situation Education Emphasizes Persuasiveness
	Hot Topic Discussions Guide the Masses to Analyze the Situation Correctly

	Xinhua News Agency reporters Xie Jinhu and Xu Jiangshan report: In the situation education in Heilongjiang Province, both propaganda and rectification are emphasized, enhancing the persuasiveness of the situation education.

	The situation education in this province began in October last year. Through investigations, they found that the opinions of the masses were quite concentrated, intense, and open, and there was even resentment towards the situation education. They believed that this situation indicated that the situation education was being conducted under special circumstances, and it was necessary to grasp both situation education and rectification. If the two were disconnected, the situation education would not only fail to be heard and understood but could also further exacerbate the masses' rebellious psychology and dissatisfaction.

	Therefore, as soon as the situation education in this province was launched, it emphasized both aspects. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government repeatedly inspected the rectification work throughout the province, requiring various places to firmly complete the rectification tasks according to the requirements of the Central Committee and the deployment of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. Jiamusi City, based on a comprehensive cleanup of ongoing projects, reduced 17 non-production projects and saved over 11 million yuan. This city took the price issue, which people generally cared about, as the core of the rectification, organizing 1,100 people to participate in price inspections, and formulated corresponding systems such as price reporting and no double wholesale within the same city, effectively controlling price increases. In October, the month when the situation education began, the price index was 1.4% lower than in September. Wuchang County introduced eight rectification measures during the situation education, protecting the legal rights of farmers and promoting grain procurement. Especially, the ban on extravagant spending throughout the province was significantly enforced, enhancing the persuasiveness of the situation education.

	This province also noted that in enterprises like Daqing and Linshui Oil Refinery, which had good reforms and high efficiency, hot issues were not hot, difficult issues were not difficult, and the workers' tolerance was relatively high, making the situation education relatively smooth. Therefore, it required various departments and units to formulate rectification measures based on their actual situations to manage their own small domains and build small environments. Mudanjiang Woodworking Machinery Factory, in response to the situation where some department personnel were dissatisfied with unfair distribution and did not work wholeheartedly, conducted ideological education and deepened enterprise internal reforms, stabilizing the workforce.

	The situation education in this province was diverse. Mudanjiang City and its affiliated counties held "hot topic debate" activities, organizing the masses to debate hot topics and speak freely. Some large and medium-sized enterprises in Qiqihar City held "everyone talks" activities, guiding workers to raise questions and have everyone answer, with the masses saying: it was more satisfying than listening to reports. Yilan County, during the grain procurement process, many farmers were dissatisfied with the low grain prices and the sharp increase in production material prices. The cadres first let the farmers voice their opinions, then acknowledged to the farmers that there were indeed unreasonable factors here, and then explained the reasons and countermeasures, stating that the government was doing everything possible to stabilize the prices of agricultural production materials, rectify the market, and hoping that the farmers would share the country's worries. In this way, the farmers began to feel better, and the grain procurement progress in the entire county was even faster than originally expected.

	The situation education in this province also had many problems. The masses' dissatisfaction with price increases and the tight supply of daily necessities had somewhat eased, but not completely. Some cadres did not take the situation education seriously, believing that situation education was abstract, while the problems raised by the masses were concrete. They were afraid that if they talked too much about achievements, the masses would not believe it and become resentful; afraid that if they talked too much about problems, it would affect the prestige of the Party and the government; afraid that if they talked too much about rectification measures, they would not be implemented in the future.

### 一手抓宣传　一手抓整治  黑龙江形势教育讲求说服力  开展热门话题讨论引导群众正确分析形势

　　一手抓宣传　一手抓整治
    黑龙江形势教育讲求说服力   
    开展热门话题讨论引导群众正确分析形势
    本报讯  新华社记者谢金虎、徐江善报道：黑龙江省在形势教育中，一手抓宣传教育，一手抓整顿治理，增强了形势教育的说服力。
    这个省的形势教育从去年１０月开始。通过调查，他们发现群众的意见相当集中、激烈和公开，对形势教育甚至有反感。他们认为这种情况说明这次形势教育是在特殊形势下进行的，必须一手抓形势教育，一手抓整顿治理。如果两者脱节，形势教育非但不能入耳入脑，反而可能进一步激化群众的逆反心理和不满情绪。
    因此，这个省的形势教育一展开，就突出了两手抓。省委、省政府多次对全省整治工作进行检查，要求各地坚决按照中央要求和省委、省政府的部署完成整治任务。佳木斯市在全面清理在建项目的基础上压缩非生产项目１７项，资金１１００多万元。这个市把人们普遍关注的物价问题作为整治的核心来抓，组织１１００多人参加物价检查，并相应制定了物价申报、同一城市不准流通环节搞两次批发等制度，有效地控制了物价上涨，１０月份形势教育开始的当月物价指数就比９月份下降１．４％。五常县在形势教育中出台８项整治措施，维护了农民的合法利益，促进了征购粮工作。特别是全省范围吃喝风的明显收敛，增强了形势教育的说服力。
    这个省还注意到，在大庆林源炼油厂等一些改革好、效益高的企业，热点问题不热，难点问题不难，职工承受能力较强，形势教育比较顺利，于是要求各部门、各单位结合实际，制定管好小天地、建设小环境的整治措施。牡丹江木工机械厂针对本厂部分科室人员由于对分配不公不满而不安心工作的情况，既进行思想教育，又深化企业内部改革，稳定了职工队伍。
    这个省的形势教育形式多样，牡丹江市及其所属各县开展了“热门话题辩论会”活动，组织群众就热门话题开展辩论，畅所欲言。齐齐哈尔市一些大中企业开展“大家谈”活动，引导职工自己提问题大家作答案，群众反映说：比听报告解渴。依兰县在征购粮过程中，许多农民对粮价低、生产资料价格猛涨不满意，干部们先让农民提意见，然后向农民承认这里确有不合理的因素，进而讲清原因和对策，说明政府正在千方百计稳定农业生产资料价格，整顿市场，希望农民为国分忧。这样一来，农民开始顺气了，全县征购粮进度比原来预料的还快。
    这个省的形势教育也存在不少问题。群众对物价上涨与对日用生活品供给紧张的不满情绪有所缓解，但还没平抑。有些干部对形势教育不够重视，认为形势教育是虚的，群众反映的问题是实的，怕把成绩讲多了，群众不信服，引起反感；怕把问题讲多了，影响党和政府的威信；怕整治办法讲多了，今后落实不了。
