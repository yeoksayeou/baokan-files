Air Force leaders, including Commander Wang Hai and Political Commissar Zhu Guang, conducted situation education in the troops from January 9 to 25. They abandoned the practice of relying on headquarters for preparation and reading from scripts during speeches. Instead, they connected with the troops' actual thoughts, prepared their own materials, deepened their understanding, and enhanced their ability to resolve doubts and answer questions during the education sessions, achieving excellent results.

Before visiting the troops, the Air Force leaders did not rely solely on the materials provided by the headquarters. Instead, they focused on studying relevant documents, listing 20 questions related to correctly understanding the current situation and the military's situation, and discussing each one thoroughly. They aimed to understand both the theory and practice, ensuring they were well-prepared to give situation lectures to the troops and correctly answer the questions raised by the troops.

The Air Force leaders visited 16 aviation brigades, academies, training bases, and 25 regiment-level units, extensively interacting with the masses, understanding the situation, and addressing some common thought recognition issues. They gave 19 situation reports to the troops and held 105 various types of meetings to face-to-face answer the questions raised by the officers and soldiers.

　　王海等空军领导深入部队搞形势教育
    本报讯  １月９日至２５日，空军司令员王海上将、政委朱光中将等６名领导同志深入部队进行形势教育，摒弃那种教育准备靠机关、做起报告照稿念的做法，联系部队思想实际，自己动手学习准备，既加深了认识，又增强了教育中解疑释难的能力，收到了很好的教育效果。
    空军领导同志深入部队之前，不满足机关提供的各种资料，而集中时间认真学习有关文件，围绕如何正确认识当前和军队的形势，列出２０个问题，逐个研究讨论，力求从理论和实践结合上弄通，为下部队讲好形势课，正确回答部队提出的问题，做了充分的思想理论准备。
    空军领导同志先后深入到１６个航空兵师、院校、训练基地和２５个团级单位，广泛接触群众，了解情况，针对一些带普遍性的思想认识问题，给部队作了１９场形势报告；针对个别同志的思想认识问题，召开了１０５次各类人员座谈会，面对面地解答官兵提出的一些问题。
