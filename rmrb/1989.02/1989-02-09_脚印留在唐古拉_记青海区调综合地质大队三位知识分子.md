People know that Tanggula is the "Roof of the World," and it is called the "Forbidden Zone of Life." In reality, this place, with an average elevation of over 5,000 meters, has its unique charm. From the three ordinary intellectuals of the Qinghai Comprehensive Geological Survey Team, we might be able to see their pursuits and aspirations.

Hot Blood in the Highlands

Wang Yunshan is over 50 years old, of medium height. Perhaps because he has been carrying a heavy geological bag filled with rock samples for many years, he looks a bit hunched. In 1955, Wang Yunshan graduated from Changchun Geological Institute and spent a year in the Tanggula region of northern Tibet. After that, he was transferred to the Qinghai Geological Bureau and went out to the field every year, from the mountainous areas of eastern Qinghai to the deserts of Qaidam, from the glaciers and forests of the Qilian Mountains to the source of the Tanggula River, deep in the clouds. If Qinghai Province is compared to a large white rabbit lying on the map, then the routes Wang Yunshan has traveled in Qinghai for mapping and mineral exploration over the past 30 years are like the blood vessels spreading throughout the body of the white rabbit. And Wang Yunshan, like all geological team members, is the hot blood flowing in these blood vessels. In 1978, his two research achievements won the Qinghai Provincial Science Conference Award. In 1982, the research project "China's Sinian Boundary" led by Wang Yunshan won the third prize in the National Natural Science Awards. His more than 20 papers have been published in important professional journals nationwide. The Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources Comprehensive Geological Survey Team is responsible for the research project "Metamorphic Belts and Metamorphic Actions in Qinghai Province and Adjacent Regions" assigned by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. Wang Yunshan, with his geological bag, went deep into the key areas for field investigations, and together with his companions, collected and identified more than 500 types of rock and mineral samples, reviewed more than 20,000 rock and mineral identification materials, and re-examined 3,000 rock and mineral identifications. In 1985, this project passed the review and acceptance in Beijing.

The harsh natural environment has tempered Wang Yunshan into a strong physique. At over 50 years old, his figure, carrying the geological bag, still often appears in the vast deserts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

She Cherishes Tanggula

Not everyone's body can withstand the harsh trials of nature like Wang Yunshan. Dr. Zhang Yi Bai, who graduated from Beijing, discovered symptoms of bloody stools soon after arriving in Tanggula in early 1985; in 1986, during her second trip to Tanggula, the bloody stools became more severe. She thought this was just a common high-altitude reaction and continued to work until winter came, when she returned to Xining with everyone else.

One night, while writing her application to join the Communist Party, Zhang Yi Bai suddenly experienced uncontrollable bloody stools. Zhang Yi Bai was diagnosed with rectal cancer. Just over 40 years old, with children who had not yet grown up, and a husband who had been injured at work... there were so many things waiting for her! She cried out in pain and shed tears whenever she saw someone.

The leadership decided to send someone to accompany Zhang Yi Bai to Beijing for treatment. On the day of departure, many people came to see her off, most of whom were comrades who had shared life and death in Tanggula. As the train started, the eyes of those tough men who had been tempered in Tanggula were also filled with tears. However, in April 1987, after being discharged from the hospital, Zhang Yi Bai immediately returned to Xining. She said, "'The Cultural Revolution' wasted our best years. I am at my prime, how can I lie down and do nothing?" In 1988, Zhang Yi Bai and Zhao Suixin, wife of Wang Yunshan, took over the clinic that no one wanted to manage. She worked hard to improve the quality of medical care while strictly enforcing the rules. Many seriously ill patients received proper treatment. The medical expenses, which were over 120,000 yuan the previous year, were reduced to 90,000 yuan the following year.

In October 1987, Zhang Yi Bai joined the Communist Party of China.

"Coming to Qinghai, You Must Study Tanggula"

On November 7, 1987, Wuhan Geological Institute celebrated its 35th anniversary. The school held a scientific report meeting and invited 10 alumni, 9 of whom were renowned experts and professors at home and abroad, while only one was a 25-year-old young man. He was Zhang Zunqi, the "Young Tanggula" of the Qinghai Comprehensive Geological Survey Team. During his school days, Zhang Zunqi was an outstanding student and the first in his class to be admitted to the Communist Party. His graduation thesis was highly praised and was recommended for publication in the "Stratigraphy and Paleontology Journal." In 1984, when he graduated and was assigned a job, the school intended to keep him on campus. Zhang Zunqi thought: "Studying geology, how can you succeed without going to the field?" He decided to go to Qinghai, where the land is vast and the research level is relatively low. The Qinghai Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources assigned him to teach at a geological vocational school. Zhang Zunqi complied, but he was not happy: "If you don't go to the field, why come to Qinghai?" In early 1985, Zhang Zunqi requested to go to the front lines of the field. The leadership agreed and transferred him to the Comprehensive Geological Survey Team, assigning him to the Tanggula squad. From then on, Zhang Zunqi began his arduous pursuit in Tanggula and on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. He once proudly said, "Coming to Qinghai, you must study Tanggula!"

For three consecutive years, Zhang Zunqi went to the field in Tanggula every year.

In 1987, Zhang Zunqi went to Tanggula for the third time, working in the area known as "Ghost Gate" in Wuduoliang. Two mountain ranges form a "wind gap" here. On the afternoon of April 27, as soon as Zhang Zunqi and his team got off the car, they were greeted by a blizzard that felt like knives cutting into their exposed skin. Everyone felt the effects of high-altitude sickness, with their chests feeling like they had a wad of cotton, making it difficult to breathe. On the night of May 4, the temperature suddenly dropped to below -20 degrees Celsius, and the wind force exceeded 8 levels. The door was blown open by the wind, and snow poured into the tent, blowing onto the beds and into the blankets, melting and then freezing again. Everyone had to put on their clothes and huddle in the ice-cold tent all night. The next day, they found that the hot water bottles, toothpaste, and pearl cream they had placed before sleeping had all frozen into ice lumps.

There was very little fresh water here. They had to live by a saline lake. Every day they drank salty water, and drinking a cup of water was like drinking a cup of medicine. Under such harsh conditions, Zhang Zunqi and his teammates remained undaunted. While completing the mapping task with high quality, they also discovered several valuable mineral points.

　　脚印留在唐古拉
　　——记青海区调综合地质大队三位知识分子
　　马今有
    人们都知道唐古拉是“世界屋脊”，称它为“生命的禁区”。其实，这块平均海拔５０００多米的地方，自有独特的魅力。我们从青海区调综合地质大队三位普通知识分子身上，或许能看出他们的追求和向往。
　  高原上涌动的热血
    王云山５０多岁了，中等身材。也许是常年背着沉重的、装满岩石标本的地质包的缘故，看上去有点驼背。１９５５年，王云山刚从长春地质学院毕业，便在藏北的唐古拉地区跑了一年。此后，他调到青海地质局，更是年年出野外，从青海东部农业区的丛山峻岭到柴达木的戈壁沙滩，从祁连山的冰川、密林到唐古拉江河源头的白云深处。如果把青海省比作一只卧在地图上的大白兔，那么，王云山３０年来在青海填图、找矿走过的路线，就如同遍布这只白兔全身的血管。而王云山和所有地质队员一样，是在血管中流动的热血。１９７８年，他的两项科研成果获青海省科学大会成果奖。１９８２年，以王云山为负责人的科研项目《中国震旦亚界》获全国自然科学三等奖。他的２０余篇论文在全国重要的专业刊物上发表。青海省地矿局区调综合地质大队承担了地矿部下达的编制与研究《青海省及毗邻地区变质地带与变质作用》的科研项目。王云山背起地质包深入重点地区，在野外作实际调查，和同伴们一起采集、鉴定了各类岩矿样品５００多个，查阅了两万余分岩矿鉴定资料，复查岩矿鉴定３０００多个。１９８５年，这个项目在北京通过了评审验收。
    严酷的自然环境，为王云山锤炼出坚强的体魄。５０多岁的人了，他背着地质包的身影，还常常出现在青藏高原无边的荒漠上。
　  她依恋着唐古拉
    并非所有人的身体都像王云山那样经得住大自然的严酷磨练。从北京毕业的女医生张意白１９８５年初上唐古拉，就发现便血的症状；１９８６年二上唐古拉，便血越来越厉害。她认为这只是一般的高山反应，照常坚持自己的岗位，直到冬天降临，才和大伙一起返回西宁。
    一天晚上，正在写入党申请书的张意白，忽然便血不止。张意白患了直肠癌。刚刚４０出头，未成年的儿女，受工伤的丈夫……有多少事等着她呢！她失声痛哭，见人就流泪。
    领导决定派人送张意白去北京治疗。上车那天，好多人都来送行，不少是唐古拉生死相依的战友。列车开动的时候，那些在唐古拉磨练出的硬汉子眼中也噙满了泪水。然而，１９８７年４月出院后，张意白立即返回了西宁。她说：“‘文革’耽误了我们最好的时光。我正是出力的时候，怎能躺着不动呢？”１９８８年，张意白和王云山的爱人赵随馨承包了没人愿意出头的队医务所。她一面努力提高医疗质量，一面认真坚持执行制度。许多重病号得到了妥善的治疗。医药费也从前年的１２万多元，降到去年的９万元。
    １９８７年１０月，张意白加入了中国共产党。
　  “来青海，就要研究唐古拉”
    １９８７年１１月７日，武汉地质学院纪念建校３５周年。校方举办科学报告会，邀请了１０名校友，其中９位是国内外享有盛誉的专家、教授，只 有一位是年仅２５岁的青年。他就是青海省区调综合地质大队的“青年老唐古拉”张尊启。在校攻读硕士研究生的同班同学向他祝贺说：“你的报告证实，经历也是一种宝贵的财富。”
    在学校，张尊启是三好学生，在１９８０级第一个被吸收入党。他的毕业论文受到好评，被推荐到《地层古生物学报》上发表。１９８４年毕业分配时，学校有意让他留校工作。张尊启想：学地质，不跑野外怎能有出息？他决定到地广人稀、研究水平较低的青海去。青海地矿局把他分到条件相对优越的地质专科学校教书。张尊启服从了，但心里不是滋味：“不出野外，何必来青海！”１９８５年初，张尊启提出了到野外第一线去的要求。领导同意了，把他调入区调综合地质大队，编在唐古拉分队。从此，张尊启开始了他在唐古拉、在青藏高原的艰苦追求。他曾自豪地说：“来青海，就要研究唐古拉！”
    连续三年，张尊启年年在唐古拉跑野外。
    １９８７年，张尊启三上唐古拉，在人称“鬼门关”的五道梁一带工作。东西两条山脉在这里形成了一个“风口”。４月２７日下午，张尊启他们一下车，便见漫天风雪刀子般地刺向人们裸露着的皮肤。每个人都感到了高山反应，胸口像塞着一团棉花，呼吸十分困难。５月４日夜，气温骤然下降到零下２０多摄氏度，风力也超过了８级。门被大风吹开了，雪灌进了帐篷，吹到床上，钻进被窝，融化了，又结成冰。大伙只好穿上衣服，在冰窖似的帐篷内蹲了一夜。第二天一看，睡前放的热水袋、牙膏、珍珠霜都冻成了冰疙瘩。
    这里淡水很少。他们不得不住在一个咸水湖边。每日饮用咸水，喝一杯水，犹如喝一杯药。在这样艰苦的条件下，张尊启和队友们仍然斗志不减，在高质量地完成填图任务的同时，还发现了多处有价值的矿点。
