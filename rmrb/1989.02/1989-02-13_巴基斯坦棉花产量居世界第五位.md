Pakistan's cotton production now ranks fifth in the world. In the 1987-1988 fiscal year, the country produced 8.9 million bales of cotton (one bale equals 170.2 kilograms), accounting for 7.4% of the world's total cotton production. The export value of raw cotton accounted for 11.3% of the world's total raw cotton exports, ranking third. The export value of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other cotton textiles in the 1987-1988 fiscal year accounted for 33.7% of Pakistan's total foreign trade exports.

During the sixth five-year plan period (July 1983 to June 1988), Pakistan's average annual cotton planting area was 2.38 million hectares, accounting for 12% of the total agricultural planting area. The average annual production of raw cotton was 6.53 million bales, with the highest production in the 1987-1988 fiscal year reaching 8.9 million bales. The value of cotton production accounted for an average of 23.3% of the total agricultural output value, with the highest in the 1987-1988 fiscal year reaching 29.6%. During this period, Pakistan averaged an annual export of 2.51 million bales of raw cotton, with the highest in the 1986-1987 fiscal year reaching 3.77 million bales. The average annual foreign exchange earnings were $3.96 billion, with the highest in the 1987-1988 fiscal year reaching $6.1 billion. The average annual cotton export value accounted for 12.3% of Pakistan's total foreign trade export value.

To increase cotton production, the Pakistan Central Cotton Committee has implemented a series of scientific and economic measures. First, it promoted the experience of rational dense planting in high-yield fields, which has now been extended to 90% of cotton fields. Second, in addition to providing comprehensive agricultural loans each year, it also provides special cotton research loans to cultivate high-yield cotton varieties. So far, 23 excellent varieties have been cultivated, of which the NIA-B-78 variety cultivated by the Faisalabad Agricultural and Biological Nuclear Research Institute has been planted in 58% of cotton fields. Third, it increased the use of fertilizers, with an average of 640 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare in the 1985-1986 fiscal year. The government provides direct fertilizer subsidies to farmers, with an average subsidy of 0.93 rupees per kilogram of fertilizer over the past decade (1 rupee equals 0.2052 yuan). Fourth, the government formulated a cotton price support policy, such as setting the purchase price of NIA-B-78 cotton at 12.6 rupees per kilogram. In addition, a series of technical training programs have been carried out. This has enabled Pakistan's cotton production per hectare to exceed the world average of 512 kilograms for many years, reaching 582 kilograms in the 1987-1988 fiscal year.

The cotton spinning industry is Pakistan's largest industry, with a production value of 27% of the total industrial output value in the 1987-1988 fiscal year. Pakistan currently has 225 registered cotton spinning mills, with a total installed capacity of 4.46 million spindles. The cotton yarn production in the 1987-1988 fiscal year was 686,000 tons, and the cotton cloth production was approximately 1.78 billion square meters. In the 1987-1988 fiscal year, Pakistan exported 210,000 tons of cotton yarn, earning $520 million, accounting for 11.9% of the total foreign trade export value for that year. It exported 850 million square meters of cotton cloth, earning $480 million, accounting for 10.9% of the total foreign trade export value. The export value of other cotton textiles was $481 million, also accounting for 10.9% of the total foreign trade export value.

　　巴基斯坦棉花产量居世界第五位
    金明礼
    巴基斯坦的棉花产量现在居世界第五位，一九八七至一九八八年度产棉八百九十万包（一包等于一百七十点二公斤），占世界棉花总产量的百分之七点四，原棉出口额占世界原棉总出口额的百分之十一点三，名列第三。棉纱、棉布及其他棉织品一九八七至一九八八年度出口额占巴基斯坦外贸总出口额的百分之三十三点七。
    巴基斯坦在第六个五年计划期间（一九八三年七月至一九八八年六月），棉花播种面积年平均二百三十八万公顷，占农作物播种面积的百分之十二，年平均产原棉六百五十三万包，最高年度一九八七—一九八八产棉八百九十万包，棉花产值占农业总产值年平均的百分之二十三点三，最高年度一九八七—一九八八年棉花产值占农业总产值为百分之二十九点六。这期间，巴平均每年出口原棉二百五十一万包，最高年度一九八六至一九八七出口三百七十七万包，平均每年创汇三点九六亿美元，最高年度一九八七至一九八八创汇六点一亿美元，年平均棉花出口额占巴外贸出口总额的百分之十二点三。
    为增加棉花产量，巴基斯坦中央棉花委员会采取了一系列科技经济措施。首先是推广高产田的合理密植经验，目前已推广到百分之九十的棉田。第二，每年除提供农业综合贷款外，还专门提供棉花科研贷款，用以培育棉花高产良种，到目前为止已培育二十三个优良品种，其中由弗萨拉堡农业和生物核研究所培育的ＮＩＡＢ—７８良种已在百分之五十八的棉田上播种。第三，增加化肥用量，一九八五至一九八六年度平均每公顷用化肥六百四十公斤，政府为农民提供直接化肥补贴，十年来平均每公斤化肥补贴○点九三卢比（一卢比等于○点二○五二元）。第四，政府制定了棉花价格支持政策，如规定ＮＩＡＢ—７８子棉收购价为每公斤十二点六卢比。此外，还进行了一系列的技术培训工作。这样，使巴基斯坦棉花每公顷单位面积产量多年来超过五百一十二公斤的世界平均产量，一九八七至一九八八年度达到五百八十二公斤。
    棉纺业是巴工业的最大行业，一九八七至一九八八年度产值占工业总产值的百分之二十七。巴基斯坦现有注册的棉纺厂二百二十五个。总装机能力为四百四十六万纱锭，一九八七至一九八八年度棉纱产量为六十八点六万吨，棉布产量约十七点八亿平方米。一九八七至一九八八年巴基斯坦出口棉纱二十一万吨，创汇五点二亿美元，占当年外贸出口总额的百分之十一点九，出口棉布八点五亿平方米，创汇四点八亿美元，占外贸出口总额的百分之十点九，其他棉织品出口额为四点八一亿美元，也占外贸出口总额的百分之十点九。
