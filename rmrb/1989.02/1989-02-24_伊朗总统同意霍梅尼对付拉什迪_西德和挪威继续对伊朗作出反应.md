Iranian President Agrees with Khomeini on Handling Rushdie; West Germany and Norway Continue to Respond to Iran

    New York Times, Belgrade, February 22 (Reporter Wang Sen) Iranian President Khamenei today stated at a press conference here that there is no disagreement between him and Khomeini on the issue of Rushdie. When discussing the decision by EEC countries to recall their ambassadors to Tehran, he said, "Iran will naturally respond."

    New York Times, Bonn, February 22 - The West German government today announced the cancellation of visits by two cabinet members to Iran to protest against the Iranian leader Khomeini's refusal to withdraw the death sentence on Rushdie.

    Government spokesman Ost said today that Chancellor Kohl called on "all civilized nations" to oppose Iran's threat. He said the West German government has suspended the implementation of the German-Iranian cultural agreement and halted preparations for the next meeting of the German-Iranian Economic Commission.

    Federal Foreign Office State Secretary Adam Schwaetzer also said that it is important now to work with other countries that have good relations with West Germany to influence Iran.

    New York Times, Stockholm, February 22 - Oslo reports that the Norwegian government recalled its ambassador to Iran on the 21st to protest against the Iranian leader Khomeini's death sentence on British writer Rushdie.

    This is the first time since 1905 that Norway has indefinitely recalled an ambassador to express opposition to the host country. Before making this decision, the Norwegian government had consulted with the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland. This decision has been approved by the Norwegian Parliament.
