Last year, the Soviet Union's *Izvestiya* Sunday Supplement Issue 12 and *Soviet Soldier* Issue 10 successively published articles recounting the true story of the death of Stalin's eldest son, Yakov.

In July 1941, in the Nazi concentration camp, a provocative leaflet was distributed:

“Soviet Lieutenant, Artillery Battalion Commander Yakov Zhugashvili wrote a letter to his father, Joseph Stalin. The letter said: 'Dear Father, I have been captured. But I am being treated well and am in good health. Soon I will be transferred to a German officer camp. Wish you good health. Greetings to the whole family, Asya!'

Learn from Stalin's son! He surrendered and became a prisoner of war.”

At the same time, the Hitler gang also used propaganda tools to widely publicize Yakov's alleged "surrender" process. The news reached the Soviet Union, undoubtedly causing a great stir. Some people who were not aware of the truth actually believed that Yakov had surrendered and betrayed his country. Later, there were many legends about Yakov Zhugashvili's death. It was not until 1970 that *Literaturnaya Gazeta* reporter Yona Andronov, based on the "File 176" from the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration's Foreign Documents Division, published an article titled "Prisoner of Sachsenhausen" in the *Literary Georgia* magazine, that many historical facts were clarified.

In September 1938, Yakov entered the Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy, graduating with excellent results, obtaining the rank of lieutenant, and joining the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). On June 22, 1941, Yakov, with the steady steps of a soldier, came to his father's office: requesting to go to the front line. This was the last time he saw Stalin.

On July 6, 1941, the German Third Tank Group launched a fierce attack on the Soviet defense line where Yakov was stationed. On July 15, when Yakov raised his submachine gun and shouted towards the enemy, a shell suddenly exploded near him, and he immediately lost consciousness. On July 16, Yakov was captured by the Germans while in a coma. Due to the betrayal of a traitor, the enemy knew that he was Stalin's eldest son.

On July 18, German Army Lieutenant Colonel Walter Holt presided over the first interrogation of Yakov. The result was nothing.

In the autumn of 1941, Yakov was brought to the headquarters of the "Central" Army Group Commander, Field Marshal Gunter, for a second interrogation. During this time, Yakov Zhugashvili firmly denied that there could be any compromise between capitalism and communism, and believed that the Soviet people would definitely win the war.

In December 1941, Yakov was transferred to the 13-D Officer Camp in Hamburg, where he was tortured to the point of death, but the enemy could not shake his strong will. After that, he was moved to the 13-B Camp in Nuremberg and a camp near Lübeck. Finally, Hitler personally ordered Ribbentrop to send Yakov to the death camp—Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.

Yakov Zhugashvili was locked in a special "A" camp. Perhaps many people know that anyone who enters the "A" camp does not come out alive. But Yakov, with his special identity, could find a way out. At that time, as long as he wrote a letter or made a statement, he could escape death, but he never did so.

According to former Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp prisoner Leon Vishinsky, "I learned some details about Yakov in prison from a guard. At that time, people knew that Stalin had rejected the German fascists' proposal to exchange Yakov for German Field Marshal Paulus. The fascists were angry and wanted to execute Yakov, and they wanted to film the execution process and then send it to Stalin, wanting Stalin to witness his son's tragic death and suffer a lifelong conscience punishment. The method they designed was: let Yakov Zhugashvili's 10 fingers and toes receive electric shocks one by one, slowly torturing him to death. On April 14, 1943, the day of the execution, several important figures from the German SS came to the camp. A table was placed not far from the electric fence, and they let Yakov sit behind the table, with the camera aimed at him. However, the clever Yakov did not let their plot succeed: he quickly rushed towards the electrified iron wire fence, and everyone present was stunned by his action. At this moment, someone suddenly shot him..." Thus, Yakov, at the age of 36, died a heroic death. But Stalin never found out the exact fate of his eldest son during his lifetime.

On October 28, 1977, Yakov's daughter Galina Zhugashvili received on behalf of her father the Order of the Patriotic War, First Class, awarded by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR stated: "This is to commend his heroic spirit and unwavering will in the fight against the Hitler invaders and in the fascist prison."

　　他没有背叛祖国
    ——雅科夫之死真相
    解红
    去年，苏联《消息报》星期日增刊第１２期和《苏联军人》第１０期相继发表文章，追述了斯大林长子雅科夫之死的真情。
    １９４１年７月，在德国法西斯军队的战俘集中营中散发着这样一份煽动性传单：
    “苏军上尉、炮兵连长雅科夫·朱加什维利写信给他的父亲约瑟夫·斯大林。信中说：‘亲爱的父亲，我被俘了。但我受到良好的待遇，身体很好。不久我将被转入德国的军官集中营。祝您身体健康。向全家问候，亚沙！’
    学习斯大林儿子吧！他投降作俘虏了。”
    与此同时，希特勒匪徒还利用舆论工具，大肆宣扬雅科夫的所谓“投降”经过。消息传到苏联，无疑引起了轩然大波，一些不明真相的人，当真认为雅科夫投降卖国了。后来关于雅科夫·朱加什维利之死的传说也很多。直到１９７０年《文学报》记者约纳·安德罗诺夫根据美国国家档案局外国文件处的“一百七十六号档案”，在《文学格鲁吉亚》杂志上发表了《萨克森豪森的囚犯》一文，才澄清了很多史实。
    １９３８年９月，雅科夫进入了捷尔任斯基炮兵学院，后以优异成绩毕业，取得上尉军衔，并加入了全联盟共产党（布尔什维克）。１９４１年６月２２日，雅科夫迈着军人坚定的步伐来到父亲办公室：请求上前线。这是他最后一次见到斯大林。
    １９４１年７月６日，德军第三坦克群向雅科夫所在的苏军防线发起猛烈进攻。７月１５日，当雅科夫端起冲锋枪、呐喊着向敌人冲去的时候，一颗炮弹突然在他身边爆炸，他顿时失去了知觉。７月１６日，雅科夫在昏迷状态中被德军俘获。由于叛徒的出卖，敌人知道了他就是斯大林的长子。
    ７月１８日，德国陆军少校瓦尔特·霍尔特主持了对雅科夫的第一次审讯。结果一无所获。
    １９４１年秋，雅科夫被带进“中央”集团军司令、陆军元帅贡特尔的总部，对他进行了第二次审讯。其间，雅科夫·朱加什维利断然否认资本主义和共产主义之间可以搞什么妥协，坚信苏联人民一定会赢得战争的胜利。
    １９４１年１２月，雅克夫被转入汉莫堡第１３—Ｄ军官集中营，在那里他被折磨得死去活来，但德寇还是没能动摇他那坚强的意志。这之后他又被转移到纽伦堡第１３—Ｂ集中营和吕贝克附近的一所集中营，最后，希特勒亲自指令里宾特洛甫将雅科夫送入死亡集中营——萨克森豪森集中营。
    雅科夫·朱加什维利被关进一个特殊的“Ａ”集中营。也许很多人知道，大凡进入“Ａ”集中营的人没有一个能活着出来。但雅科夫凭着自己的特殊身份是可以找到出路的，当时只要他写一封信或发表一个声明就会逃脱死神，可他始终没有那样做。
    据前萨克森豪森集中营的囚犯利昂·维谢斯基回忆道：“我从我们集中营的一个守卫人员那里打听到一些关于雅科夫狱中的细节。那时，人们知道斯大林拒绝了德国法西斯用雅科夫换取德军元帅保卢斯的建议。法西斯党徒发怒了，他们要处死雅科夫，并想把处死的经过拍摄下来，然后转给斯大林，想让斯大林亲眼目睹自己儿子的惨死，使良心受到永久的惩罚。他们设计的方法是：让雅科夫·朱加什维利１０个手指和脚指轮流受电刑，慢慢地把他折磨死。１９４３年４月１４日行刑那天，德国党卫军的几个要人来到了集中营。在离电网不远的地方放好一张桌子，他们让雅科夫坐到桌子后面，摄影机对准了他。然而机智的雅科夫没有让他们的阴谋得逞：他迅速扑向带电的铁丝网，在场的人都被他这一举动惊呆了。这时忽然有人朝他开了一枪……”就这样，年仅３６岁的雅科夫壮烈地牺牲了。但斯大林生前却一直未曾打听到他长子的确切下落。
    １９７７年１０月２８日，雅科夫的女儿加林娜·朱加什维利代领了苏联最高苏维埃主席团追授给她父亲的一枚金光闪闪的一级卫国战争勋章。苏联最高苏维埃主席团的授勋命令说：这是为了“表彰他在同希特勒侵略者的战斗中和在法西斯监狱中表现出的英勇气概和坚定不移的精神”。
