The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, with the approval of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, issued a notice on January 19 to all local youth league organizations regarding the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The notice outlines specific arrangements for the commemorative activities.

The Central Committee of the Youth League proposed in the notice that the theme for this year's May Fourth activities is "Patriotic, Reform, Entrepreneurship, Strive Forward." Through these activities, the revolutionary tradition and patriotic spirit of the May Fourth Movement will be further inherited, and the democratic and scientific spirit will be carried forward. The goal is to inspire and unite the strength of young people from all ethnic groups across the country, and under the guidance of the theory and line of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, to strive hard for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The Central Committee of the Youth League requires that local and grassroots commemorative activities should be oriented towards reform and towards youth.

It is understood that the Central Committee of the Youth League will hold a commemorative meeting for the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement in the Great Hall of the People on May 4. During the meeting, a group of outstanding young individuals will be honored.

During the May Fourth period, the curtain will also be raised on the "First China Youth Culture and Science Expo," inviting leaders and experts in the youth movement to hold a theoretical discussion on "The May Fourth Movement and the Youth Movement."
