Various countries have universally welcomed the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan on schedule, hoping that all factions in Afghanistan will exercise restraint, stop the civil war, and establish a stable government.

According to a compilation of Xinhua News Agency reports, the Soviet military withdrew from Afghanistan in accordance with the Geneva Agreement, ending its nine-year military occupation of the country. Countries around the world have expressed their welcome for this development.

Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto both issued statements on February 15, expressing their congratulations.

President Zia-ul-Haq stated in his message: "February 15 is a historic day. According to the Geneva Agreement, the Soviet Union has completely withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan. This is first and foremost a credit to the brave Afghan people who, through long-term struggle and sacrifice, have freed their country from foreign military occupation."

He said that for the freedom and independence of their homeland, more than a million Afghans have sacrificed their lives.

He said, "At this moment, we express our deep appreciation to all those who have provided moral and material support for the just cause of our Afghan brothers."

He said that the long night of foreign occupation has passed, but dawn is accompanied by conflict. Only by establishing a government with a broad base can peace be achieved.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in her statement that the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan is a historic moment for the brave Afghan people and the world's freedom-loving people.

She pointed out that the Soviet withdrawal also proves the correctness of Pakistan's policy of seeking a political solution to the Afghan problem.

Prime Minister Bhutto expressed her appreciation for the Soviet Union's significant change in policy, enabling it to complete the Geneva Agreement and successfully withdraw from Afghanistan.

U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said on February 15, "For the Afghan people, this is a long-awaited day. From now on, they can decide their own future." He emphasized that after the Soviet withdrawal, the U.S. policy towards Afghanistan is not to impose a blueprint on the Afghan people, but to help them "self-determine."

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky both welcomed the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan on February 15.

Kohl issued a statement saying that the Afghan conflict has the danger of continuing in the form of civil war. Therefore, the West German government calls on all parties involved in the conflict to take rational, realistic, and responsible actions.

Kohl said that West Germany and the European Community countries unanimously believe that the ultimate goal of resolving the Afghan problem is to achieve a democratic, independent, and non-aligned Afghanistan.

Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky believed that the Soviet withdrawal of all its troops from Afghanistan is an extremely important step towards completely resolving the conflict in the region.

He hoped that after the withdrawal of foreign troops, various factions in Afghanistan could exercise restraint and contribute to the stability of the country.

NATO also issued a statement on February 15, welcoming the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said that the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan "meets the requirements of the international community and greatly contributes to the easing and stabilization of East-West relations."

The official said that Japan is willing to provide economic aid to Afghanistan after the war, but he also said that Afghanistan can only receive genuine government development aid from Japan after establishing a stable government and ending the civil war. Before that, Japan can only provide humanitarian aid to refugees from a humanitarian perspective.

　　各国普遍欢迎苏联如期撤军    
    希望阿富汗各派克制停止内战建立稳定政府
    本报综合新华社消息：苏联军队按照日内瓦协议如期从阿富汗撤出，从而结束了对阿富汗长达９年的军事占领，世界各国对此普遍表示欢迎。
    巴基斯坦总统吴拉姆·伊沙克·汗和总理贝·布托１５日分别发表文告，表示祝贺。
    总统伊沙克在文告中说：“２月１５日是具有历史意义的一天。根据日内瓦协议的规定，苏联从阿富汗全部撤军。这首先应归功于经过长期斗争、不惜一切牺牲来使他们国家摆脱外国军队占领的英勇的阿富汗人民。”
    他说，为了他们祖国的自由和独立，１００多万阿富汗人献出了他们的生命。
    他说：“在此之际，我们对为我们阿富汗兄弟的正义事业在道义上和物质上给予了大力支持的所有人们深表赞赏。”
    他说，外国占领的长夜已过去，但黎明又伴随着冲突。只有建立有广泛基础的政府，和平才能实现。
    贝·布托总理在文告中说，苏联从阿富汗全部撤军对英勇的阿富汗人民和世界热爱自由的人民来说，是一个历史时刻。
    她指出，苏联撤军也证明巴基斯坦寻求政治解决阿富汗问题的政策的正确。
    布托总理对苏联对其政策进行重大改变，使之能够完成阿富汗问题日内瓦协议并成功地履行协议从阿富汗撤军表示赞赏。
    美国国务院发言人雷德曼１５日对记者说，“对于阿富汗人民来说，这是盼望已久的日子。从现在起，他们可以自己决定自己的未来了。”他强调苏联撤军后美国对阿富汗的政策不是给阿富汗人民“提出一个蓝图”，而是帮助他们“自决”。
    西德总理科尔和奥地利总理弗拉尼茨基１５日对苏军全部撤出阿富汗表示欢迎。
    科尔发表声明说，阿富汗冲突有着一种以内战形式继续下去的危险。因此，西德政府呼吁冲突各方采取理智的、现实的和有责任感的行动。
    科尔说，西德和欧洲共同体国家一致认为，阿富汗问题全面解决的目标是实现一个民主、独立和不结盟的阿富汗。
    奥地利总理弗拉尼茨基认为，苏联从阿富汗撤出其所有军队为彻底解决这一地区的冲突迈出了极其重要的一步。
    他希望，在撤出外国军队之后，阿富汗国内各派能够互相克制，为国家的稳定作出贡献。
    北约组织１５日也发表声明，对苏军撤出阿富汗表示欢迎。
    日本外务省人士认为，苏联从阿富汗撤军“符合国际社会的要求，大大有助于东西方关系的缓和与稳定”。
    这位人士说，日本愿意向战争结束后的阿富汗提供经济援助，但是，他又表示，阿富汗只有在建立了稳定政权和结束了内战以后，日本才能提供真正意义上的政府开发援助。在此之前，日本只能从人道主义立场出发，对难民进行援助。
