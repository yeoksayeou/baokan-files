Publishing serious political and theoretical works need not be a loss. Take a look at Random House: a success story.

By Cang Lidé, People's Daily Reporter

Can serious political and theoretical works be bestsellers? Indeed, they can. The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers by Paul Kennedy, a Yale University history professor, is a highly academic work, but since its publication at the beginning of last year, it has been a consistent bestseller, with over 260,000 paperback copies sold. At the beginning of this year, both the authoritative New York Times Book Review and Time magazine independently listed this book as one of the best books of 1988, and bookstores received a flurry of new orders. Will the United States inevitably repeat the historical tragedy of the Spanish maritime empire, the Napoleonic military empire, and the British colonial empire, which rose to greatness and then declined over the past 500 years? This thought-provoking question has captivated the hearts of many readers!

Random House, with its keen eye, published such an influential and widely appreciated masterpiece, which cannot help but make its American counterparts envious. In fact, this is just one of its many successes.

The English word "Random" means "chance" or "casual." The founding of Random House was indeed somewhat accidental.

In the early 1920s, there were two young men in New York who were full of ambition but had little interest in business. One was Bennett Cerf, a graduate of Columbia University who worked as a stockbroker at his uncle's firm on Wall Street; the other was Donald Klopfer, who dropped out of Williams College and worked in his father's diamond business. One morning, a friend of Cerf's called to ask if he would be interested in buying his position at a publishing house. Cerf, who loved literature, quit his job that very day. In August 1925, Cerf and Klopfer pooled $200,000 in capital to establish the Modern Library Publishing House. Two years later, they founded Random House with the intention of casually selecting some literary works to publish.

Random House's first-year revenue was a mere $25,000, with negligible profits. To accumulate funds and expand the business, for a long time, Cerf and Klopfer set very low salaries for themselves. More than 60 years later, Random House became the leading publishing company in the United States, with over 20 subsidiaries in adult, children's, and high school/college divisions, and annual revenue reaching approximately $400 million. How did Random House stand out among the strong competitors in the American publishing industry?

Seizing opportunities and having a far-sighted vision are key characteristics of Random House's operations.

Facing the growing interest of Americans in knowledge and art in the 1920s, Cerf and Klopfer initially published inexpensive literary works with low profits but high sales. Later, they released beautifully bound hardcover editions, and their selection of titles continued to expand. They traveled extensively between Europe and America, acquiring copyrights and finding authors. They published classic works by French Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire, as well as works by American modern writers like Theodore Dreiser, poets like Walt Whitman, journalist and writer Edgar Snow, French writer André Malraux, and Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud. By the outbreak of World War II, Random House had published over 400 medium-length works and 150 "big books" like Tolstoy's War and Peace.

Cerf and Klopfer frequently traveled and gave lectures, promoting Random House's catalog and authors while personally interacting with readers, understanding their tastes, and observing the changes in American society and culture. In 1947, Cerf keenly sensed that the American education and library industries were about to experience significant growth. He decisively invested $600,000 to publish the American College Dictionary and released a low-priced paperback edition, breaking the monopoly of the Webster's Dictionary at the time. This investment did not start to yield profits until six years later.

Browsing through Random House's catalog, you will find that, according to American standards, the vast majority of the content is serious and of high quality. This is because most readers are willing to buy books that satisfy their desire for knowledge and have lasting value. One example is that in the 1970s, memoirs about the Watergate scandal flooded the market, but Random House believed most were sensational and lacking in substance, so they did not follow this trend. Once, Random House published a large number of Roosevelt's public documents, but sales were very poor. Klopfer's view was: "Such books must be published. They don't necessarily all make money, but someone has to do it." Klopfer's requirement for his subordinates was that as long as they aimed for a break-even point, it was fine.

In Random House's view, maintaining quality is as important as protecting the company's interests and reputation.

Gottlieb, who has won the New York Best Editor award multiple times, said, "I don't plan book by book. If the overall result is good, then even if 30 books lose money, it doesn't matter." In Random House's current total revenue, literature, art, social sciences, natural sciences, textbooks, and children's educational materials account for the majority, with educational materials alone accounting for over 50%.

Bernstein, the chairman of Random House, often says, "The authors write the books, not Random House." "The human brain is the world's greatest natural resource." To develop this resource, Random House places great importance on discovering and nurturing authors, respecting and protecting the legal rights of authors. In 1949, American writer William Faulkner, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature, was just a young novice when he published with Random House in the 1920s. When Marchetti's The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence faced publishing obstacles, Random House spent $100,000 in legal fees, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court.

Random House also published works by Soviet dissidents like Sakharov and Medvedev, who were banned in the Soviet Union, without hesitation. In the mid-1980s, Random House's average advance payment for each work was as high as $100,000.

Maintaining a high-quality, efficient, and intellectually active editorial team is a crucial factor in Random House's thriving business.

Random House has a large number of editors who are experts in their fields and have broad interests. Its editor-in-chief, James Hillman, said, "If you let the editors think independently, the chances of success increase." The president of Warner Publishing Company remarked with deep feeling: "Random House not only hires the best talent in the publishing industry but also lets the horses run."

The pursuit of Random House's editorial department is endless. In recent years, they have turned their attention to other regions of the world, particularly Asia. They have published sociological works about China. It is reported that recently, they will collaborate with the China Foreign Languages Publishing Company to publish the English and Chinese versions of Selected Works of Chinese Youth Reportage, edited by Chinese writer Liu Binyan.

More than 60 years of ups and downs have passed, but Random House's strong sense of social responsibility and its original intention to satisfy readers' desire for knowledge with high-quality books have remained unchanged. Looking back at Random House's journey to becoming the number one "publishing kingdom" in the United States, who can say that Random's success is "accidental" or "casual"?

　　出版严肃的政治理论著作不一定就亏本，请看——
    蓝登書屋：一个成功的故事
    本报记者  仓立德
    严肃的政治和理论性著作也能畅销？不错。美国耶鲁大学史学教授保罗·肯尼迪的《强权的兴衰》，无论怎样衡量都是学术性颇强的作品，但自去年初问世后至今畅销不衰，单平装本已售出２６万余册。今年初，权威性的《纽约时报》每周书评和《时代》周刊不约而同将此书列入８８年全美最佳书目后，各书店新订单又纷至沓来。美国是否注定会重演５００年来西班牙海上帝国、拿破仑军事帝国、大不列颠殖民帝国盛极而衰的历史悲剧？这个引人深思的问题攫住了多少读者的心！
    蓝登书屋慧眼独具，出版了这样一本影响广泛、雅俗共赏的上乘之作，不能不令美国同业羡慕。其实，这只不过是它许多成功中的一例。
    英语Ｒａｎｄｏｍ（音译“蓝登”）一词，有偶然、随便的意思。说起蓝登书屋的草创，还确实有点偶然。
    ２０年代初，纽约有两位踌躇满志、对经商缺乏兴趣的小伙子。一位是哥伦比亚大学毕业生贝内特·瑟福，在叔叔的华尔街事务所当股票掮客；一位是威廉斯大学中途辍学的唐纳德·克洛法，干着父亲的钻石生意。一天上午，瑟福的一位朋友打电话问他是否愿意买下他在一家出版社的职位。酷爱文学的瑟福当天便辞去工作。１９２５年８月，瑟福拉克洛法凑了２０万美元资本，单独成立了现代图书馆出版社。两年后，创建蓝登书屋，意思是要随便选择一些文学作品出版。
    蓝登书屋头年的营业额只有区区２．５万美元，利润微不足道。为了积累资金、扩展事业，在很长一段时间里，瑟福和克洛法为自己规定了很低的工资。悠悠６０余载后，蓝登一跃成为美国首屈一指的出版公司，下辖成人、少儿、中学大学３个部门共２０多个分公司，年收入达到约４亿美元。在强手如林的美国出版业，蓝登书屋何以如此出类拔萃呢？
    　　　　善抓时机、目光远大是蓝登的一大经营特点。
    面对２０年代美国人对知识和艺术的兴趣愈益浓厚的潮流，瑟福和克洛法起先出版薄利多销的廉价文学作品，后来又推出外观华美的精装本，选题也不断扩大。他们不断奔波于欧美各地，购买版权，寻找作者。他们既出版法国启蒙思想家伏尔泰等古典名著选集，也出版美国现代作家西奥多·德莱塞、诗人惠特曼、记者兼作家埃德加·斯诺等人以及法国作家安德烈·马尔罗、奥地利心理学家弗洛伊德的作品。至二次大战爆发前，蓝登已出版４００余种中等篇幅作品，和１５０种像俄国托尔斯泰的名著《战争与和平》那样的“大部头”。
    瑟福和克洛法经常旅行并举行讲座，一方面宣传蓝登的书目和作者，一方面亲自接触读者，揣摸他们的口味，观察美国的社会文化变迁。１９４７年，瑟福敏锐地觉察到美国教育事业和图书馆业将面临大发展，毅然决定投资６０万美元出版《美国大学生辞典》，并推出低价平装本，打破了当时《韦伯斯特辞典》的垄断局面。这笔投资６年之后才开始创利。
    翻阅蓝登书屋的书目，你会发现，按照美国的标准，绝大多数内容是严肃的，质量是上乘的。因为大部分读者都愿意买那些能满足求知欲并具有保存价值的书籍。一个事例是，７０年代后，有关“水门事件”的回忆录充斥书市，但蓝登书屋认为大都是些重感情、少事实的哗众取宠之作，因此不愿追逐这股潮流。一次，蓝登大量出版了罗斯福总统的公开文件，但销路极差。克洛法的看法是：“这种书必须出版。不一定全都赚钱，但总得有人出。”克洛法对下属的要求是，只要争取不亏不盈就行。
    　　　　在蓝登看来，讲究质量与维护公司利益和信誉同等重要。
    连获纽约最佳编辑称号的戈特列布说，“我绝不一本书一本书地打主意。如果整个结果是好的，那么即便有３０本赔钱也无关紧要。”在蓝登书屋现在的总营业额中，文学、艺术、社会科学、自然科学、教科书、少儿启蒙读物等出版物占了绝大部分，其中仅教育类即占５０％以上。
    蓝登董事长伯恩斯坦常说，“写书的是作者，不是蓝登书屋。”“人类的大脑是世界上最伟大的自然资源。”为了开发这个资源，蓝登极为重视发掘和培养作者，尊重和保护作者的合法权益。１９４９年获得诺贝尔文学奖的美国作家福克纳，２０年代在蓝登出书时不过是个初出茅庐的青年。在马切蒂的《中央情报局和情报崇拜》出版受阻时，蓝登书屋花费１０万美元诉讼费，将官司一直打到最高法院。
    曾遭苏联禁止出版的不同政见者萨哈罗夫、麦德维捷夫兄弟等人的作品，蓝登也照出不误。８０年代中期，蓝登为每部作品预付给作者的定金平均高达１０万美元。
    　　　　保持一支素质高、效率高、思想活跃的编辑队伍，是蓝登事业蒸蒸
    　　日上的一个重要因素。
    蓝登拥有一大批学有专长、兴趣广泛的编辑。它的总编辑詹姆斯·希尔伯曼说，“如果你让编辑独立思考，成功的机会就多了。”美国华尔纳出版公司总裁颇有感触地说：蓝登书屋“不但雇用了出版业最棒的人才，而且让马儿跑起来。”
    蓝登书屋编辑部的追求是无止境的。近几年来，他们把目光伸向世界其他地区，尤其是亚洲。出版了有关中国的社会学专著。据悉，最近它将与中国中外文化出版公司分别出版由中国作家刘宾雁编选的《中国青年报告文学作品选》英、中文版。
    ６０余年的风风雨雨过去了，蓝登书屋强烈的社会责任感、用高质量书籍满足读者求知欲的初衷却始终如一。回首蓝登成长为饮誉全美的头号“出版王国”的历程，谁能说Ｒａｎｄｏｍ的成功是“偶然”、“随便”的呢？
