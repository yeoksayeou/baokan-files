Li Guixian, a member of the State Council and Governor of the People's Bank of China, visited the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China and the Bill Exchange Center this afternoon to extend New Year greetings and to learn about the recent savings deposit situation in the capital.

When the person in charge of the Beijing branch reported that the savings of urban and rural residents in Beijing had grown this January to the level of the first half of last year, Li Guixian happily said, "I have also observed several savings offices, and the amounts deposited are large, while the amounts withdrawn are small." He said, "Doing a good job in savings work is also about protecting the interests of the masses. We must insist on voluntary deposits and free withdrawals, and ensure payment. The bank's credibility is its lifeblood." He emphasized that this year, we must focus on savings work.

　　李贵鲜看望银行职工
    新华社北京２月５日电  （记者姜军）国务委员、中国人民银行行长李贵鲜今天中午来到中国人民银行北京分行和票据交换中心，先是拜年，进而了解了首都近来的储蓄存款情况。
    当北京分行负责人汇报说今年１月份北京城乡居民储蓄增长，已经达到了去年上半年的水平时，李贵鲜高兴地说，我也观察了几个储蓄所，存进去的都是大数，取出来的是小数。他说，做好储蓄工作也是保护群众利益，一定要坚持存款自愿取款自由，要保证支付。银行的信誉就是生命。他强调，今年要重点抓好储蓄工作。
