	To Our Readers

	The Ministry of Justice's Legal Propaganda Department has recently decided that the focus of legal propaganda and education this year will be on officials at all levels. Building on the completion of the study of the "Ten Laws and One Regulation," the emphasis will be on studying 16 laws and regulations, including the "Enterprise Law." To welcome the first anniversary of the promulgation of the "Enterprise Law," to implement the "Enterprise Law" during the rectification and to promote the deepening of the overall reform, the forthcoming "Enterprise Manager's Must-Read – Special Issue on the Enterprise Law" will be an excellent textbook.

	After the "Enterprise Law" was promulgated in April last year, from May to August, the second page of this newspaper opened a special column, successively publishing 20 articles on "Explanation of Articles" written by the Research Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. At that time, a wide range of readers, especially enterprise managers and department heads in charge of enterprises, responded strongly, sending letters and calls requesting the full set of explanatory texts for organizational study and training. To meet the needs of the majority of readers, in September and October, the Research Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Economic Department of this newspaper decided to jointly edit the "Special Issue on the Enterprise Law."

	During the editing of this book, considering the completeness of the article explanations, in addition to supplementing and revising the 20 articles that have been published, the original authors added 20 more articles, totaling 40 articles. The article explanations basically provide a detailed explanation of all the articles of the "Enterprise Law." This book also collects more than 20 related laws and regulations closely related to the "Enterprise Law," as well as important speeches by leaders of the Communist Party of China and relevant departments. This will help readers better grasp and implement the basic spirit of the "Enterprise Law" to promote reform and run enterprises well.

	This book will be published by the Book and Periodical Publishing House at the end of March. The Economic Department of this newspaper is handling mail-order subscriptions. The price per copy is 3.74 yuan (including postage). Factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, military units, schools, and individuals can all subscribe through the post office by remitting payment to Chen Qiu Lian at the Office of the Economic Department of the People's Daily, No. 2 Jin Tai Xi Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100733.

　　致读者
    司法部法制宣传司最近确定，今年法制宣传教育的重点是各级负责干部。要在已完成“十法一条例”学习的基础上，着重学习《企业法》等１６个法律、法规。为迎接《企业法》颁布一周年，在治理整顿中贯彻落实《企业法》，促进全面深化改革而即将出版的《企业经营者必读——〈企业法〉特辑》，不失为一本良好教材。
    去年４月《企业法》颁布后，５至８月间本报第二版开辟专栏，陆续发表了由全国人大常委会办公厅研究室撰写的２０篇《条文解说》。当时，广大读者特别是企业经营者和企业主管部门干部反应强烈，纷纷来函来电要求提供全套解说文本，以供组织学习和培训之用。为满足广大读者的要求，９、１０月间全国人大常委会研究室和本报经济部决定联合编辑《企业法特辑》一书。
    在本书编辑过程中，考虑到条文解说的完整性，除对已发表的２０篇作了补充修订，又由原作者增写了２０篇，合计４０篇条文解说基本上对《企业法》全部条款进行了详细阐述。本书还汇集了中共中央有关《通知》、《决定》，党和国家领导人及有关部门负责人的重要讲话，与《企业法》密切相关的配套法律法规２０多个。这将有助于读者更好地掌握和落实《企业法》的基本精神，以推进改革，办好企业。
    本书由书目文献出版社于３月底推出。本报经济部正在办理邮购征订，每册售价３．７４元（含邮资），厂矿企业、机关单位、部队、院校、个人订购一律通过邮局汇款至１００７３３北京朝外金台西路２号人民日报经济部办公室陈秋莲同志处。联系电话为５９６２３１转２６１０分机。　　　　——编者
