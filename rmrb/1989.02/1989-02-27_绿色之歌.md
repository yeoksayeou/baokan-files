Three-Du Water Miao Autonomous County is located in the southeastern part of Guizhou Province, in the southern part of the Miao Mountains on the Yun-Gui Plateau, at the upper reaches of the Douliujiang and Longjiang rivers. The area is crisscrossed by rivers and covered with lush forests, earning it the nickname of "a place as beautiful as a phoenix's feathers" among the local Water Miao people.

In this mountainous county, where "nine-tenths of the land is mountains, half of the remaining land is water, and the rest is farmland," wood is the primary source of revenue, and green is the dominant color.

Ten kilometers east of the county seat is the Lalan Forest Farm, a vast expanse of cypress and pine trees. Crossing mountains and valleys to visit this "hundred-mile sea of forests" with over 400 ridges and 2,400 peaks, one's heart is immersed in the deep green hues. Farm manager Liu Shunchang told me that over the past 30 years, Lalan Forest Farm has taken a difficult path of hard work and innovation. At its peak, the farm had 286 workers, but at its lowest, only 3 remained. Without dormitories, they built temporary huts; without draft animals, they relied on manual labor. In 1958, when the farm was established, they braved the cold and snow, working for 100 days to plant over 10,000 mu of trees. In 1961, when the farm was closed, they left 3 people to guard the site, preserving the buildings, draft animals, tools, and young trees. Over 30 years, 120,000 mu of saplings and young trees have been nurtured into lush forests. It is estimated that Lalan Forest Farm now has over 400,000 cubic meters of fast-growing, high-yield forests. In spring and summer, this place is a vibrant world: misty, with flowing water and birdsong.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Pan Guoqing and Pan Guozhu, two brothers from Banshan Village, Jiuquan Township, Jiuquan District, led the locals to establish a collective forest farm. In 1982, they planted 1,500 trees of Lichuan yellow fruit, and in 1983, they planted 34,000 trees of Wenzhou honey tangerines, along with 15,000 mu of timber forests. In 1988, the fruit farm alone earned over 100,000 yuan. The people of Banshan Village joyfully said, "The mountains that were once destroyed by indiscriminate logging are now green again."

In recent years, Three-Du Water Miao Autonomous County has placed great importance on afforestation. The county has planted 440,000 mu of trees, covering 30% of the barren mountain area. There are now 431 households specializing in forestry, planting 250,000 mu of trees. Among them, 15 households in Liupai Village, Shangjiang Township, planted 29,850 mu of fast-growing fir trees in 1984, and 3 households in Yangze'en, Puan Township, planted 13,440 mu of fir trees in 1985. The locals call them the "green heroes" of Three-Du County.

Just as I was singing praises for this green expanse, another melancholic and heavy melody began to intermingle.

According to the "Forestry Records" of Three-Du County, the forest coverage rate was 49.5% in 1957, but it dropped to 26.8% in 1975 and further plummeted to 18.84% in 1985. Over 28 years, the forest area on this 357,000 mu of land has been decreasing at a rate of 41,000 mu per year. Over the past 10 years, only 18.1% of the man-made forests have been preserved.

Some scholars and experts have warned: if this trend continues, the green forests of Three-Du County will one day disappear!

The Yao Mountain Nature Reserve is the gene bank of Three-Du County's forests, with tree species accounting for about 60% of the county's total. Twelve large and small streams originate from it, making it an important water conservation forest area. However, due to differing opinions among the province, prefecture, and county on the reserve's status, it has not been officially designated as a nature reserve. After the timber market was opened in 1985, allowing for negotiated purchases and sales, some people, disregarding the relevant regulations of the "Forest Law," entered the reserve to buy trees from farmers. According to a 1986 survey, 160 cubic meters of mixed fir logs were felled in the reserve in just one year.

The reasons for the indiscriminate logging and theft of forests can be traced back to the 1950s. At that time, farmers exchanged their private forests for collective ownership, making the forests collectively owned. The forests entered the collective, but the value was not returned to the farmers. Additionally, after the forests became collectively owned, there were no effective management measures, leading to frequent disputes over forest rights and land, which to some extent affected the farmers' enthusiasm for protecting and planting forests. On April 3, 1988, a forest fire occurred at the Jiuquan District Forest Farm. The district committee and government mobilized officials, staff, and nearby residents to put out the fire, but only 5 officials from the district government went to the mountain to extinguish the fire, resulting in the loss of over 14,000 mu of young forests.

Deputy Director Li Jizui of the County Forestry Bureau told me, "In 1988, the county felled 22,000 cubic meters of timber. Excluding the 8,000 cubic meters allocated by the state, the rest was used by the locals for building houses and fuel."

Forestry engineer Yang Xiu'nong said, "Here, civilian timber is not subject to planning, and many farmers find excuses to fell trees. Some sell timber without a license, and some district and township leaders have an ambiguous attitude towards the illegal sale of timber, even providing fake certificates. Three-Du County's agriculture, forestry, and sideline industries are relatively backward, and farmers lack money. When they need to build houses (Water Miao farmers' homes are mostly wooden), they have no firewood to burn and cut down big trees. Only felling and not planting, and the replanting of fallow land does not keep up, resulting in green mountains turning into barren hills."

Water Miao farmer Pan Hongjun from Sanhe District's Miaolong Township complained, "We live on the mountains. The government regulations state that slopes steeper than 25 degrees should be reforested, but we want to plant trees and have no money. They said that planting one mu of fir trees would be subsidized with 12 yuan, but this amount still needs to deduct the seedling fee. Now everything is increasing in price, and everyone needs money. We can't even afford rice, let alone trees!"

It is understood that the number of township and village forest farms in Three-Du County peaked in 1977, with a total of 54 farms covering nearly 120,000 mu. Ten years later, a survey found that the county only had 25 township and village forest farms left, with the number of closed farms accounting for 55% of the original number, and the management area reduced to 60,000 mu.

Facing such a decline, the decision-makers of Three-Du County can no longer be "optimistic." Shishi Mingqing, the county's deputy secretary in charge of forestry, said, "Forestry is related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Green symbolizes youth and peace. We cannot treat it lightly, nor can we miss this opportunity. The advantage of Three-Du County lies in its mountains, and its hope lies in its forests."

The old leaves have fallen, and the new buds have just sprouted. The nurturing and protection of green life have become the unanimous wish and common call of the entire county.

May the green of Three-Du, as beautiful as a phoenix's feathers, not become a "phoenix without feathers is not as good as a chicken"! (Accompanying photo)

The "water color" of Three-Du Water Miao Autonomous County is rich: rice, fruits, aquatic products, waterways, and the girls are as fresh as water. Look! The girls from Zhonghua Village smile so sweetly.

　　绿色之歌
    本报记者  郭嘉
    三都水族自治县，位于贵州省东南部，地处云贵高原苗岭山脉以南的都柳江和龙江上游。境内众水嵌流，群峰洗翠，林木葱茏，自古以来被水族群众誉为“凤凰羽毛一样美丽”的地方。
    在这“九山半水半分田”的山区县，木头是主要的财政来源，绿色主宰着这里的色彩世界。
    距县城东去１０公里，是遍生杉松的拉揽林场。翻山过坳，踏访这片拥有４００多条山岭，２４００多座山头的“百里林海”，心情便沉醉于那墨韵氤氲之中。场长刘顺昌告诉我，３０年来，拉揽林场走的是一条艰苦创业之路。职工最多时２８６人，最少时仅有３人。没有宿舍，搭茅屋暂住；缺少耕牛，靠人拉手刨。１９５８年林场上马，他们冒寒顶雪，苦战一百天，造林一万余亩；１９６１年林场下马，他们留下３人坚守岗位，保住了房屋、耕畜、工具和幼林。３０年来，经人工培育的１２万亩嫩苗幼树，而今郁葱蒙密。据估算，拉揽林场现有人工速生丰产林４０余万立方米。春来夏到，这里是一片水灵灵的世界：雾气霭霭，流水淙淙，雀鸣啾啾……
    党的十一届三中全会以后，九阡区九阡乡板南村水族农民潘国清和潘国柱弟兄二人，带领群众办起了联户林场。１９８２年栽荔波黄果１５００株，１９８３年栽温州蜜桔３．４万株，同时栽用材林１．５万亩。１９８８年仅果场收入就达１万多元。板南村群众高兴地说：“过去被滥砍毁坏的山林现在又泛新绿了。”
    近几年来，三都水族自治县很重视抓绿化工作。全县造林４４万亩，占整个荒山面积的３０％。现有各类林业专业户４３１户，造林２．５万亩。其中，上江乡柳排村田永清等１５户，１９８４年造杉木速生林２９８５亩，普安乡杨泽恩等３户１９８５年造杉木林１３４４亩。群众称他们是三都县的“绿林好汉”。
    正当我为这片绿色唱赞歌时，另一种抑郁而凝重的曲调也交叠袭来。
    据三都县《林业志》记载：１９５７年，三都县的森林覆盖率达４９．５％；１９７５年下降到２６．８％，１９８５年猛跌至１８．８４％。２８年间，在这块幅员３５７万亩的土地上，森林面积以每年４．１万亩的速度锐减。１０年来，只造不护的人工林，仅有１８．１％被保存下来。
    一些学者、专家惊呼：照此下去，三都县的绿色有朝一日将不复存在！
    瑶人山自然保护区是三都县的森林物种库，树木种类约占全县的６０％，１２条大小溪流从它那里发源，是重要的水源涵养林区。然而，多年来，由于省州县对这片林区的级别意见不一致，便一直没有正式确认为自然保护区。１９８５年木材市场放开实行议购议销后，一些人不顾“森林法”的有关规定，进入林区向农民点株购买。据１９８６年调查，１年时间砍伐保护区内的杉杂圆木竟达１６０立方米之多。
    山林遭受滥砍盗伐的原因，还要追溯到５０年代去。当时，农民将自己的山林折价入社，山林成为集体所有。林入了社，但“价”没有还给农民，加上山林归集体后没有切实可行的管理措施，致使林权、林地纠纷不断，在某种程度上影响了农民护林、育林的积极性。１９８８年４月３日九阡区区办林场发生森林火灾，区委区公所动员机关干部职工及附近群众救火，可是，仅有区机关干部５人到山场扑火，结果该林场１４００多亩幼林付之一炬。
    县林业局副局长李际最告诉我：“１９８８年全县共伐木材２．２万立方米，除国家调用８０００立方米以外，其余的都被群众建房、生火用掉了。”
    林业工程师杨秀农说：“我们这儿民用木材不申报计划，不少林农借故砍伐木材。有的无证销售，个别区乡领导对无证销售木材态度暧昧，甚至为其出具假证明。三都县农工副业比较落后，农民缺钱花了拆旧房（水族农民居舍多为木板房），没柴烧了放大树。只砍不栽，迹地更新造林又跟不上，致使一座座绿山变成了黄土坡。”
    三和区苗龙乡水族农民潘洪军抱怨说：“我们居住在山圪圪上，政府规定２５度以上的山坡退耕还林，我们愿意造林，就是没钱。上面说了造一亩杉树补助１２元，可是，这当中还要扣除种苗费。现在什么都涨价，哪方都要钱，我们米都买不起，还指望什么树呃？”
    据了解，三都县乡村林场发展最多时为１９７７年，共有５４个乡村林场，经营管理面积近１２万亩。１０年后调查时发现，全县只剩下２５个乡村林场，下马数占原林场数５５％，经营管理面积也减少到６万亩。
    面对如此颓势，三都县的决策人士再也不敢“乐观”了。主管林业工作的县委副书记石明卿说：“林业关系国计民生，绿色象征青春与和平，我们既不能等闲视之，更不能坐失良机。三都县的优势在山，希望在林。”
    老叶早已落尽，新芽刚刚萌生。绿色生命的孕育和保护已成为全县上下的一致愿望和共同呼声。
    但愿像“凤凰羽毛一样美丽”的三都绿色，不会成为“拔掉毛的凤凰不如鸡”！（附图片）
     三都水族自治县“水色”浓：水稻、水果、水产、水路，还有姑娘们长得水灵，瞧！中化村的姑娘笑得多甜。
