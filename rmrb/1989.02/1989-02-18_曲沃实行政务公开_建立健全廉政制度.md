The Communist Party of China's Quwo County Committee has, since last August, focused on issues that the public strongly cares about, such as taxation, household registration, electricity usage, and business license issuance. They have implemented administrative transparency in 19 administrative management departments, law enforcement departments, and public utility units across the county, achieving noticeable results.

The county leadership first conducted pilot programs in the industrial and commercial, taxation, and electricity departments. After gaining experience, they expanded the initiative to 89 grassroots service departments under the 19 administrative management departments, law enforcement departments, and public utility units. To date, the county has made public 200-plus items and 1,000-plus conditions across 19 aspects, including industrial and commercial, taxation, electricity, public security, finance, and prices. They have distributed and posted various promotional materials totaling 12,000-plus copies, held 360-plus public consultations, and fully disclosed the procedures for handling matters.

While establishing and improving the open administration system, Quwo County also strengthened both internal and external supervision mechanisms. The county's disciplinary inspection commission, procuratorate, and supervision bureau formed a joint inspection network. The county's economic commission, planning commission, agricultural commission, financial commission, and all townships established inspection groups. The county government's departments that manage personnel and finances set up inspection offices and inspectors, thus forming a supervision network. The county has set up 21 hotlines for reporting, 305 reporting boxes, issued 4,875 opinion solicitation letters, held 210 various symposiums, and appointed 586 volunteer supervisors. The county promptly investigates and handles public feedback and reports. For example, an electrician in Beiguanzhuang Village charged an extra 50 cents per meter when installing electricity meters for the public. After the Electricity Bureau verified the issue, they immediately had the electrician return the money and apologize door-to-door.

Administrative transparency has also promoted changes in the work style and efficiency of government agencies. The difficulty of handling matters at the county government departments has significantly improved. Previously, obtaining a new business license from the Industrial and Commercial Bureau required at least three to five visits, forcing applicants to seek help and give gifts. This year, when changing licenses, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau staff went to various townships, enterprises, and individual businesses to handle the process, greatly improving work efficiency.

### 曲沃实行政务公开  建立健全廉政制度

　　曲沃实行政务公开
    建立健全廉政制度
    本报讯  中共山西省曲沃县委从去年８月以来，抓住群众反映强烈的收税、转户、用电和发营业执照等问题，在全县１９个行政管理部门、执法部门和公用事业单位中实行政务公开，收到了明显的成效。
    曲沃县领导先在工商、税务、电业三个部门试点，取得经验后再推广到１９个行政管理部门、执法部门和公用事业单位下属的８９个基层办事部门。到目前为止，全县已向社会公开了工商、税务、电业、公安、金融、物价等１９个方面、２００多项、１０００多条办事制度，散发、张贴各种宣传资料１．２万多份，公开咨询问答３６０多次，全方位公开了办事制度。
    在建立健全办事公开制度的同时，曲沃县还注意加强内部和外部的监督机制。县委纪检委、县检察院、监察局组成联合监察网，县经委、计委、农委、财委和所有乡镇设立了监察组，县政府所属的管人财物的“实权”部门设立监察股和监察员，从而形成了监督网络。全县共设举报电话２１部，举报箱３０５个，发出征求意见书４８７５份，召开各种座谈会２１０次，聘请义务监督员５８６人。对群众的反映、举报坚持及时查处。北关村一名电管员给群众安装电表时每表多收５毛钱，电业局查实后，立即让其逐户登门退款、赔礼。
    政务公开还促进了机关作风的改变和工作效率的提高。到县政府部门办事难的现象明显转变。过去工商局换一个营业执照，至少跑三五趟，使办事人不得不到处请托，送礼“进贡”；今年换照时，工商局工作人员走出机关，到各乡镇、企业、个体户去办，工作效率大大提高。
