		A New Trend in Condolences
		By Xinhua News Agency reporter Jie Yan Zhen

		On the eve of the Spring Festival, various forms of condolence activities are taking place in military camps and urban and rural areas.

		"Condolences, condolences, feasting and welcoming."
		"Once the chopsticks are raised, it's all good."

		Such negative phenomena that were common in Spring Festival condolence activities in previous years have significantly decreased in some urban and rural areas in East China this year. Local authorities visiting the military do not drink "support-the-army wine," and the military visiting local areas do not drink "love-the-people wine." Both the military and civilians praise this new trend in condolences.

		In cities like Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Nanchang, military and political leaders held joint condolence meetings without any fruit or canned drinks, only a cup of light tea;
		In Nanjing, Hefei, and Hangzhou, military-civilian tea parties were held without any famous cigarettes, and there was no smell of alcohol.

		Some comrades who have been organizing this activity for many years told the reporter that in previous years, such condolence meetings and tea parties held in the form of Spring Festival condolences often turned into feasting events. After one meeting, just the cans and beer bottles would fill several baskets. It is rare to see a meeting like this year where there are no melon seed shells on the table and no empty bottles in the baskets.

		According to the reporter, some provinces and cities in East China have focused this year's Spring Festival condolence activities on doing practical things for the military, for the families of martyrs and veterans, and for the people. Taking Suzhou as an example, during the New Year, the military stationed there did 1,500 good deeds for the people, and the local government and people solved more than 90 problems related to military training and living conditions for the military. A local transportation company asked the military to help train their truck drivers and prepared two tables of lavish banquets to entertain the military leaders. The military leaders said, "Supporting local economic construction is our duty. We won't eat the banquet, but we will definitely help solve the problem."

　　慰问新风
    新华社记者　揭衍珍
    春节前夕，各种形式的慰问活动在军营、城乡展开。
    “慰问慰问，吃喝迎送。”
    “筷子一提，可以可以。”
    往年春节慰问活动中常见的这种不良现象，今年在华东一些城乡大为减少。地方慰问部队不喝“拥军酒”，部队走访地方不喝“爱民酒”，军民称赞这种慰问新风好。
    在上海、福州、南昌等城市举行的军政领导双慰问会上，没有摆水果和易拉罐饮料，只有一杯淡淡的清茶；
    在南京、合肥、杭州等地召开的军民茶话会上，看不到名烟，闻不到酒香。
    一些多年主办这项活动的同志告诉记者，往年这种以春节慰问形式举办的座谈会、茶话会，往往成了吃喝会，一次会后仅易拉罐壳、啤酒瓶就得装几筐。像今年这样会场没有瓜子壳，筐里没有空酒瓶，实在难得。
    据记者了解，华东一些省、市今年的春节拥军爱民慰问活动，着眼点主要放在为部队、为烈军属、为群众办实事上。以苏南为例，新年春节期间，驻这里的部队为群众做好事１５００余件，当地政府和人民群众为部队解决军事训练和生活等方面的困难问题９０多个。地方一个运输公司请求驻军帮助他们代训汽车驾驶员，并在饭店摆了两桌丰盛的酒菜款待部队领导。部队领导同志说：“支援地方经济建设是我们应尽的义务。酒菜咱不吃，问题一定帮助解决。”
