The Honest "God of Wealth"

— Bank of China's Poverty Alleviation in Ankang Receives Universal Praise

By Meng Xian, People's Daily

"Birds fly and leave a trace, people pass and leave a name." The officials from the Bank of China's headquarters in Ankang, Shaanxi, have left behind a reputation as the "honest god of wealth."

Not long ago, when the reporter arrived in the mountain city of Ankang, he heard an interesting story: During a regular meeting of the Ankang Municipal Government, there was a discussion about whether to bring some local specialties to Beijing to report on poverty alleviation industrial projects. The conclusion was: They don't go for that sort of thing.

"To get things done, gifts must come first": This tactic fails

Wang Zhiqu (Mayor of Ankang): In our eyes, the bank is the "god of wealth." Now that we are promoting a commodity economy, we need the "god of wealth" to help Ankang, but if we don't first invest in some "emotional capital" and send some gifts, it might not work. Last May, the Bank of China's headquarters held a meeting in Lintong to discuss selecting a poverty alleviation point in southern Shaanxi. Ankang is the poorest county in the province, and every year it needs a subsidy of over 6 million yuan from the state. Now that the "god of wealth" is at the doorstep, we must treat him well and strive to bring the poverty alleviation point to Ankang.

Ou Yaochang (Deputy Mayor): They say "to get things done, gifts must come first," so we prepared some local specialties and rushed to Lintong. But we found that other counties had already brought gifts and were turned down. It seems that people from Beijing and state agencies are different.

Wang Zhiqu: When we had lunch with Vice President Li Xiqiu of the Bank of China, we felt something unusual: there was no alcohol on the table, just a simple four-dish meal. Li Xiqiu said, "We have a rule when we come down: no feasts, no gifts." I heard this and quickly whispered to the county officials who came with us to take the "gifts" back untouched.

Ou Yaochang: Some places specially send people to "run to the ministries" to "achieve the four modernizations" (referring to going to central ministries to get money), but we are "not shouting, not begging." Now we can't even give gifts to people from above. Ankang being designated as a poverty alleviation point is likely to be in vain.

Wang Zhiqu: However, unexpectedly, after the Bank of China understood the situation, they abandoned their original plan to provide poverty alleviation in a relatively better-off county where poverty alleviation would be more effective, and decided to designate Ankang as the poverty alleviation point. We enthusiastically invited Vice President Li Xiqiu and his team to visit Ankang. Li Xiqiu agreed, but asked, "Can you guarantee three things when we go to Ankang: no banquets, no gifts, and no special receptions?" I used a "stalling tactic" and said, "We will definitely do it!" But in my heart, I thought, "We'll see when they get to Ankang!"

"Promote" and "test use," seizing the opportunity to give gifts: This tactic also fails

Cao Junwen (Deputy Mayor): Vice President Li Xiqiu and his team of seven arrived in Ankang on the evening of June 8, conducted on-site inspections of several industrial enterprises, visited the key national construction project Ankang Hydropower Station, and visited several impoverished households in the mountainous areas. When they saw a farmer's house with bare walls, lacking grain and firewood, and a family of four crowded on a single bed, everyone was deeply moved. Li Xiqiu told the Bank of China's staff: We must choose some projects that can quickly show results, enrich the county and the people, and avoid short-term gains. We must enhance the local "blood-making" function and help Ankang get out of poverty as soon as possible!

Wang Zhiqu: At that time, Ankang was experiencing continuous high temperatures, and the city was implementing a half-day work system, but they worked for about 18 hours a day. The city reported 22 projects that had not been reviewed as "brainstorming projects," but they personally inspected and calculated, and finally selected 4 industrial reform or development projects that could quickly show results based on local resources, adding 14.22 million yuan in new taxes per year, equivalent to half of Ankang's fiscal revenue in 1988! In the selection and reconstruction of the silk mill and printing plant, they calculated carefully, saving the state over 5 million yuan in investment!

Ou Yaochang: Seeing them work so selflessly, we felt guilty. Every time they inspected a factory, the factory would always prepare some good cigarettes, drinks, and fruits to entertain them, but they always took out their own cigarettes; they ate strictly according to the "four dishes and one soup." Once they had canned drinks. They insisted on having them removed; sometimes the dishes were large, so they only ate half, leaving the rest to be reheated for the next meal. Once I accompanied them to inspect a winery. When leaving the factory, the factory sent 4 boxes of Luokang Head Curve Wine (provincial excellence) and dried lychee wine (won the gold award at the National Food Expo), saying it was for them to taste and bring back to Beijing for "promotion," but they refused. These few boxes of wine were left in the room of the guesthouse where they stayed, and when they left, they didn't touch a single bottle.

Li Yucheng (Manager of the Bank of China's Ankang Branch): Ankang produces a type of "selenium-rich tea" with anti-cancer properties. When Vice President Li Xiqiu returned to Beijing, I let him take some to drink on the way, and if he didn't finish it, he could bring it back to Beijing for "promotion," but Li Xiqiu declined: "Old Li, every official has thousands of eyes watching them. We must not let the people point fingers at us when we pass by!" He truly did what he said, coming and going with empty hands.

It's difficult to give gifts locally, "tribute" to Beijing: This path is also blocked

Cao Junwen: If accepting gifts and banquets in Ankang is a bit of a problem, can it be different in Beijing, far from Ankang? On September 1, last year, we went to Beijing to confirm the poverty alleviation loan and took the opportunity to bring Ankang's specialty—true silk double-layer fabric, each piece 1.5 meters, a total of 20 pieces, of which 6 pieces were given to relevant department leaders, some of whom quietly accepted them, but at the Bank of China's headquarters, we encountered trouble.

Chen Guolong (Government Office Secretary): I took 14 pieces of fabric to the headquarters. I placed this white as jade, thin as cicada wings, true silk fabric on the table and said to Director Liang Ba'an, "This is a small token from the people of Ankang, please accept it!" Old Liang smiled and waved his hand, saying, "We can't accept this. Look, my short-sleeved shirt is not bad, right?" He also said, "Poverty alleviation cannot harm the poor, once a rule is established, it cannot be broken."

After a day, Deputy Mayor Cao wrote a letter to Director Liang, saying: This piece of fabric, please accept it, if you really don't accept it, please help to dispose of it locally. I took the letter and the fabric to find Director Liang again. Liang read the letter and reluctantly accepted the fabric, saying he would pay for it. I quickly said: Pay after disposal! I went downstairs, thinking: Finally, the gift was given out.

We returned to Ankang from Tianjin on the 14th. Who knew that as soon as we entered the office door, Secretary Xiao Liu said, "Why did the headquarters send 357 yuan? Did you only confirm this much funding in Beijing?" I quickly found the remittance slip and saw that the remarks section read: "Sending 14 pieces of true silk double-layer fabric." I calculated, each piece of fabric was paid 17 yuan, which is 2 yuan more than the factory price of 15 yuan in Ankang, exactly the retail price in Beijing! The comrades from the headquarters are straightforward, Ankang people didn't even get a penny! My heart warmed, as if the tide was surging from my eyes.

　　清廉“财神”   
    ——建行安康扶贫受到交口称赞
    本报记者  孟西安
    “鸟过留声，人过留名”。国家建设银行总行的同志在陕西安康扶贫，留下了清廉“财神”的美名。
    不久前，记者刚来到山城安康，就听到一桩“趣闻”：安康市政府在一次常务会议上，曾议论赴京汇报扶贫工业项目时，要不要给建设银行总行带些“土特产”，得出的结论是：人家不兴那一套。
    　　　　“办事要成，礼品先行”：此举失灵
    王志秋（安康市市长）：在俺们山区的干部群众眼里，银行是“财神”。现在搞商品经济，要让“财神”给安康解囊，不先来点“感情投资”，送送礼，恐怕行不通。去年５月下旬，国家建设银行总行在临潼开会研究在陕南选点扶贫，我们安康是全省最穷的县，每年要吃国家补贴６００多万元。现在“财神爷”走到门口，一定要敬好，把扶贫点争到安康来。
    欧耀昌（副市长）：人说“办事要成，礼品先行”，我们准备了安康的土特产，翻山越岭赶到临潼。谁知兄弟县已带着土特产去拜访，被谢绝。看来，从北京和国家机关来的人，就是不一样。
    王志秋：我们与总行李锡奎副行长共进午餐，就感到不寻常：桌上没上酒，简单的四菜一汤。李锡奎说，我们下来有个规矩：不吃请，不受礼。我一听，忙低声转告县上同来的人，把带来的“见面礼”原封不动地拉回去。
    欧耀昌：有的地方专门派人跑“部”搞“四化”（指到中央各部要钱），而我们是“不喊不到，不给不要”。现在对上边来人连礼品都送不出去。安康定为扶贫点，八成要泡汤。
    王志秋：但是，出乎意料，总行了解情况后，放弃了原先准备在一个条件相对优越、扶贫易于见效的县扶贫的打算，决定把扶贫点定到安康。我们兴奋地邀请李锡奎副行长一行到安康看看。李行长欣然应诺，但又问我：“我们去安康，你们能不能做到这三条：一不设宴；二不送礼；三不前呼后拥搞特殊接待？”我来个“缓兵之计”，说：“一定办到！”可心里却想：到安康再说吧！
    　　　　“宣传”“试用”，借机奉送：此计不从
    曹俊文（常务副市长）：李锡奎副行长一行７人，于６月８日晚来到安康，实地考察了一批工业企业，走访了国家重点建设工程安康水电站，访问了几户山区贫困户。当他们看到一户农民家徒四壁，缺粮少柴，一家四口人挤在一张单人床上时，个个心情十分沉重。李锡奎对建行的同志说：一定要选择些既富县，又富民、急功近利的“短、平、快”项目，增强当地“造血”功能，帮助安康尽早脱贫！
    王志秋：当时安康持续高温，市上实行半天工作制，可他们每天工作坚持在１８个小时左右。市上报了２２项没经过论证的“拍脑袋工程”，而他们亲自考察，算帐，最后筛选了４个依靠本地资源可迅速见效的工业科改或开发项目，每年新增利税１４２２万元，相当安康市１９８８年财政收入的一半！在绢纺厂和印刷厂的选址、改建工程上，他们精打细算，为国家节约５００多万元投资！
    欧耀昌：看到他们这样忘我工作，我们过意不去，每到一厂考察，厂方总是摆些好烟、上些饮料、水果招待，可他们总是从自己口袋摸，公家的烟从不动一根；他们吃饭，严格按“四菜一汤”。一次上了易拉罐饮料。他们硬让服务人员撤掉；有时菜盘子大，他们就吃半边，剩下了让下顿热热再吃。一次我陪他们到酒厂考察，离厂时，厂方送了４箱泸康头曲酒（省优）和猕猴桃干酒（获全国食品博览会金奖），说是让他们尝尝，并带回北京做“广告宣传”，他们拒绝了。这几箱酒一直放在他们居住的招待所房间里，临走时他们连一瓶也没动。
    李玉成（建设银行安康中心支行行长）：安康出产一种“富硒茶”，具有防癌功能。李锡奎副行长回北京时，我让他带些到路上喝，喝不完带回北京给“宣传宣传”，可李行长却谢绝了：“老李啊，我们每个干部身后都有千百双眼睛，咱走过去可不能让群众戳脊梁骨啊！”真正做到了风尘仆仆而来，两袖清风而归。
    　　　　当地难送，赴京“进贡”：此路不通
    曹俊文：如果在安康扶贫吃请受礼有点那个，在远离安康的北京，可不可另当别论呢？去年９月１日，我们到北京落实扶贫贷款，顺便捎了安康特产——真丝双绉面料，每块１．５米，共２０块，其中６块送给有关部门领导，有的不声不响地收下了，可在建设银行总行遇到了麻烦。
    陈国龙（政府办公室秘书）：我拿１４块面料去总行。我把这白如玉脂，薄如蝉翼的真丝面料放在桌上，对梁保安处长说：“这是安康人民的一点心意，请收下吧！”老梁笑着摆摆手，说：“这，我们不能收。你看，我穿的短袖衫不很好么？”他又说：“扶贫不能坑贫，立下规矩，就不能破。”
    过了一天，曹副市长给梁处长写了一封信，说：这点面料，请收下吧，实在不收，请帮忙就地处理。我带着这封信和面料又找到梁处长。梁看罢信，勉强收下面料，说着就要掏钱。我连忙说：处理完后再结帐！我一下楼，心想：总算把礼送出去了。
    我们１４日从天津赶回安康。谁知一进办公室的门，秘书小刘就说：“总行怎么汇来３５７块钱？你们到北京就落实了这么一点资金？”我连忙找到汇款单一看，附言处写道：“寄来１４件真丝双绉面料款。”我一算，每条面料交款１７元，比安康出厂价１５元高出２元，恰好是在京的零售价！总行的同志丁是丁，卯是卯，安康人民一分半文的光都没沾呀！我心中一热，好像心潮从眼眶里涌流出来。
