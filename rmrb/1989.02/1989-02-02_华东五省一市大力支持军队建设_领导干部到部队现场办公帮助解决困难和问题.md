The idea of "prosperity without forgetting national defense, strengthening the country requires a strong army" is becoming a conscious action among the people of the five provinces and one municipality in Eastern China.

According to incomplete statistics, the five provinces and one municipality in Eastern China have sent more than 1,000 department-level and above leaders to the military for on-site office work. They have helped the military solve more than 100 prominent difficulties and problems in training and daily life. There have been more than 50,000 good deeds of actively supporting the military from the public.

The five provinces and one municipality in Eastern China focus on the following aspects to care for and support military construction:

1. Provincial and municipal leaders insist on the "military discussion" system, regularly studying national defense education, militia construction, and supporting military families and veterans.

2. Doing a good job in recruiting new soldiers and ensuring the quality of recruits. Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces were the first in the country to achieve the goal of being a province without responsible deserters.

3. Establishing a network of military, local, and family thought work, assisting the military in doing a good job of soldiers' thought work.

4. Developing and utilizing military dual-use talents. Currently, the "dual-use talent introduction offices" established in the five provinces and one municipality total more than 34,000, ensuring that the vast majority of dual-use talents returning home after service are properly utilized.

5. Doing practical things for military families of martyrs and veterans, helping active-duty soldiers eliminate their worries. They have solved housing issues for more than 25,000 military families and helped more than 175,000 families of martyrs and veterans escape poverty. Jiangsu Province has changed the jobs or shifts of more than 11,000 military wives with actual difficulties in their families, and more than 23,000 children of military cadres have received priority in school enrollment and kindergarten placement.

6. Supporting the military in developing agricultural and sideline production. These provinces and municipalities have issued notices on supporting the military in developing agricultural and sideline production and allocated funds for assistance.

　　华东五省一市大力支持军队建设
    领导干部到部队现场办公帮助解决困难和问题
    新华社南京２月１日电  （记者揭衍珍）“富裕不忘国防，强国更需强兵”的思想，正在成为华东五省一市人民群众的自觉行动。
    据不完全统计，华东五省一市先后有１０００多名厅局级以上领导干部到部队现场办公，为部队解决训练和生活中较突出的困难和问题１００多个，群众中自觉拥军的好事达５万余件。
    华东五省一市着重从以下几个方面关心和支持部队建设：一、省市主要领导坚持“议军”制度，定期研究国防教育、民兵建设和拥军优属等工作。二、做好新兵征集工作，保证兵员质量。江西、安徽、浙江三省在全国首先实现无责任退兵省的目标。三、建立军队、地方、家庭思想工作网络，配合部队做好士兵思想工作。四、开发使用部队两用人才。目前，五省一市创办的“两用人才介绍所”有３．４万多个，使退伍回乡的两用人才绝大多数得到妥善使用。五、为军烈属办实事，帮助现役军人解除后顾之忧。共为２．５万多户军人家属解决了住房，帮助１７．５万多户军烈属家庭脱贫。江苏省为１．１万多名家庭有实际困难的军人妻子调换了工种或班次，２．３万名军队干部的子女得到优先入学入托的照顾。六、扶持部队发展农副业生产。这些省市分别下发了关于支持部队发展农副业生产的通知，并拨出资金给予支援。
