Thailand A Team Wins the King's Cup Football Tournament

Soviet Team Takes Second Place, Chinese Team Fourth

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, February 10 (Reporter Zhang Qiu Lai) Thailand A Team defeated the Soviet Union 3-1 tonight to win the 20th King's Cup Football Tournament. Under the cheers of tens of thousands of Thai spectators, Thailand A Team fully utilized their small, fast, and agile characteristics, daring to contest and fight. Thai star number 9 Piyapong and number 11 Batipon scored two goals in the first half, at the 9th and 36th minutes respectively. In the second half, at the 6th minute, Piyapong carried the ball past the Soviet defenders from midfield, advancing straight towards the Soviet goal. As the Soviet goalkeeper rushed out, Piyapong scored a goal. Subsequently, Soviet number 12 Alexei scored a goal for the Soviet Union at the 21st minute.

In today's match for the third place, the Chinese team lost 0-2 to South Korea. From the match situation, the Chinese players' ball control was not as good as the South Koreans. Frequent passing errors and lack of aggressive tackling were the main reasons for the Chinese team's loss.

　　泰王杯足球赛东道主捧杯    
    苏联队获亚军中国队第四
    新华社曼谷２月１０日电  （记者张秋来）泰国Ａ队今晚以３∶１胜苏联队，取得第二十届泰王杯足球赛冠军。泰国Ａ队在数万名泰国观众的助威下，充分发挥其小、快、灵的特点，敢抢敢拚。泰国著名球星九号披耶蓬和１１号巴提布分别在比赛上半时的９分钟和３６分钟时得两分。下半时第６分钟，披耶蓬从中场带球甩掉苏联后卫，直逼苏联队大门，在苏联队守门员迎出的情况下，起脚射门成功。接着，苏联队的１２号阿列克赞诺尔在进行到第２１分钟时为苏联队得一分。
    在今天举行的本届比赛第三名的争夺中，中国队以０∶２负于南朝鲜队，从比赛情况来看，中国队员的脚下功夫不如南朝鲜队。传球失误多，拚抢不够积极是中国队失利的主要原因。
