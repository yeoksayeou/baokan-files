Title: Reflections on "Inside and Outside the Realm of Qi"
Author: Yè Zhìshàn

Edition: 8

In the January 6 issue of the People's Daily, I read an essay titled "Inside and Outside the Realm of Qi." The author wrote about his experiences and observations from three times he enrolled in qi training classes. In the second instance, the author wrote about an elderly couple arguing in a small park. The wife was persuading her husband to practice qi, and she mentioned two anecdotes about qi emission, which seemed a bit too miraculous. The husband was adamant in his disbelief and even spoke disrespectfully. The old lady then challenged him, asking, "Isn't Ye Shengtao better than you? He originally did not acknowledge psychic abilities, but after seeing it with his own eyes, he eventually conceded, didn't he?"

The old lady spoke confidently, but what she said was still just hearsay. Ye Shengtao was my father. I lived with my father all the time and knew that until the end, he never "saw with his own eyes" a demonstration of psychic abilities. There were indeed well-meaning people who either called him or sent invitations, and some were even willing to perform at his home, but he politely declined all of them. Regarding psychic abilities, he did not make any further statements. Whether he "conceded" or not, he left no will, and as his son, I can only remain doubtful.

Although it was hearsay, there might have been a reason behind it. My father did have an encounter with qi. That was a couple of years ago. My father had a friend, also an old gentleman in his nineties. His secretary insisted on introducing a female qi master to treat my father, claiming she could cure any disease. The old gentleman's swollen legs were supposedly cured by her, and the secretary said the reason for introducing her was because the old gentleman had repeatedly asked. This made it difficult to refuse.

But what to treat? My father said to just have her treat his eyes, as the left eye, which had already gone blind, had started to feel swollen again those days.

On the appointed evening, the secretary accompanied the female qi master to our home. The qi master first spoke at length, saying she had practiced qi since she was young, and it was passed down from her ancestors. She also strictly followed the rules and maintained her virginity. She then recounted many of her successful cases, all of which were cured by her qi. She also took out a stack of photos to show us, all of which were photos of her treating famous people with qi. After her self-introduction, she began to emit qi, blowing on my father's left eye with "puff, puff, puff, puff." Although my father's left eye was blind, he still had some sensation, and he repeatedly answered that he felt it. At this moment, the secretary was taking photos beside him. After the photos were taken and the qi was emitted, the qi master said that it would be better after a night's sleep. She also said that although the old gentleman was still running around, his original qi was weak and he would not last until the autumn equinox. "Old Ye is much stronger, and I guarantee he can live past 100 years." This statement was quite bold. My father passed away last February, but the old gentleman is still running around. I saw him on television last night, and he still looked spirited.

As for my father's eyes, they were originally incurable, so it was not enough to prove that the female qi master's qi was not effective. I also do not intend to use this single piece of evidence to deny the intention of treating diseases with qi. My view is the same as the author of "Inside and Outside the Realm of Qi." I believe that practicing qi is beneficial. "A person who eliminates various distractions, calms the mind, and maintains a peaceful and balanced state of qi and blood is definitely beneficial to health." So, I have not practiced it. Saying I am busy is an excuse; deep down, I am just lazy. Perhaps one day I will follow the author's example and, with the enrollment fee, go to a small park to join a qi training class and become a student.

　　《功里功外》读后
    叶至善
    在１月６日《人民日报》的副刊上读到一篇散文，题目是《功里功外》，作者写他三次报名参加气功学习班的体验和见闻。其中第二次，作者写的两老夫妻吵嘴，是在小公园里听到的。作妻子的劝丈夫练气功，说了两则发功的传闻，未免神了点。那位丈夫硬是不信，还出言不逊。老太太就将了他一军，反诘说：“叶圣陶不如你？他原不承认特异功能，人家让他亲眼见了，临了还是服了不是？”
    老太太振振有辞，她说的其实还是传闻。叶圣陶是我的父亲。我和父亲一直在一起生活，知道他直到“临了”也没“亲眼见”特异功能的表演。“让他亲眼见”的好心人是有的，或者打电话来，或者寄请柬来，还有愿意上门来表演的，他都婉言谢绝了。对特异功能，他没有再次发表言论。是否“服了”，他没有留下遗言，我作儿子的也只好存疑。
    虽说是传闻，可能事出有因，父亲跟气功倒打过一回交道。那是前年的事。父亲有位朋友，也是９０出头的老先生了，他的秘书一定要介绍一位女气功师来给我父亲治病，说她什么病都能治，老先生的腿肿就是她给治好的，还说之所以介绍她来，是老先生的再三嘱咐。这就盛情难却了。可是治什么呢？父亲说就请她治眼睛吧，那只已经瞎了的左眼那些日子又有点儿发胀。
    到了约定的那天傍晚，那位秘书陪着女气功师来了。女气功师先说了许多话，说她从小练功，是祖上传下来的，并恪守清规，保持童贞；还说了许多她的诊例，都功到病除；又取出一叠照片来给我们看，都是她给知名人士发功治病的照片。自我介绍完毕，她发起功来，对我父亲的左眼“扑扑扑扑”喷气，问我父亲有没有感觉。父亲的左眼虽然看不见，感觉还是有的，他连连回答说有。就在这时候，那位秘书在一旁“咔咔”地拍照。照拍得了，功也发完了，女气功师说睡一晚上就能见好；又说别瞧那位老先生还在到处奔波，他本元虚，过不了立秋；叶老比他壮实多了，保证能活过１００岁。这句话可说豁了边，我父亲去年二月过世了，那位老先生却还在到处奔波，昨晚在电视上看到，他依旧神采奕奕。
    至于父亲的眼睛，本来是治不好的，不足以证明那位女气功师的功力不到家。我也决没有用这个孤证来否定发功治病的意图。我的看法跟《功里功外》的作者一个样，相信练气功会有好处，“一个人排除诸多杂念，心安神宁气血平和，肯定是有利于健康的。”所以没有练，说忙是推托，骨子里是懒。说不定有一天我会步作者的后尘，也带着报名费，去小公园加入气功学习班当一名学员的。
