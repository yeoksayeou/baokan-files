The 8th plenary (enlarged) meeting of the National Afforestation Commission was held this morning in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. Vice Premier and Chairman of the National Afforestation Commission, Tian Jiyun, pointed out at the meeting that the main purpose of this meeting is to analyze the situation, clarify tasks, propose measures, and deploy mobilization to further deepen the nationwide voluntary tree-planting movement, accelerate the development of forestry, and speed up the process of greening the motherland. Through on-site visits and introductions, we invite everyone to see the greening efforts in Guangdong and learn from Guangdong's experience.

The meeting reviewed and analyzed the national afforestation and voluntary tree-planting situation and concluded that over the past seven years, the broad masses of the people in various regions and departments have done a great deal of effective work to implement the resolution of the Fourth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress on launching the nationwide voluntary tree-planting movement. During the tree-planting season each year, many places have seen the inspiring scene of thousands upon thousands of people joining forces to plant trees and afforest. In seven years, 70 billion trees have been planted voluntarily nationwide. The first phase of the "Three-North" shelterbelt construction project has been completed, with 90 million mu of afforestation, and the second phase is being accelerated. There are 223 counties nationwide that have reached the plain greening standard. Nationwide, 160 million mu of grass has been planted and improved. Urban greening has developed rapidly, with the total area of park green spaces reaching 280,000 hectares, doubling in seven years.

Tian Jiyun presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. He said that the situation of afforestation and voluntary tree-planting is good, but it does not mean there are no problems. The development of the nationwide voluntary tree-planting movement is still unbalanced. Currently, about 10 billion trees are planted voluntarily each year, and the number of people participating in tree-planting is only about one-third of the statutory number. Some rural and urban units have not yet launched the nationwide voluntary tree-planting movement. Some places lack sufficient understanding of the long-term and arduous nature of the task of greening the land, and the momentum for afforestation and greening is not as strong as in previous years, leading to a relaxation of efforts and a sense of difficulty, causing the greening work to stagnate. These problems should be given high attention, and measures should be taken promptly to solve them as soon as possible.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that the fundamental to accelerating the development of forestry and greening the land is, first, the attention and practical efforts of leaders at all levels; second, the broad mobilization of the entire society to engage in greening. These two aspects are indispensable. He put forward clear requirements for the basic tasks of afforestation and greening in the next period, the establishment and improvement of the greening target responsibility system for leading cadres during their term of office, the careful formulation of afforestation and greening plans, the effective implementation of the "three defenses" in forestry, and the strengthening of publicity work. He enthusiastically praised Guangdong Province's experience of starting from the provincial party secretary Lin Ruo, with leaders at all levels taking the lead and vigorously promoting forestry.

Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary Lin Ruo and Vice Governor Ling Botang spoke at the meeting, providing a detailed introduction to how Guangdong has carried out afforestation and greening work.

Vice Chairmen of the National Afforestation Commission Gao Dezhan, Zhao Nanqi, and Lin Hanxiong, as well as the governors or deputy governors, chairpersons, or deputy mayors of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the directors of forestry bureaus, attended the meeting.

The National Afforestation Commission held a full meeting yesterday.

Tian Jiyun emphasized the fundamentals of greening.

Leadership attention—practical efforts

Broad mobilization—the whole society engages in greening

　　义务植树七十亿株
    大多数人尚未尽责
    本报广州２月１９日电  本报记者黄彩忠、新华社记者黄正根、张开机报道：全国绿化委员会第８次全体（扩大）会议今天上午在广东省广州市召开。全国绿化委员会主任、国务院副总理田纪云在会上指出，这次会议主要是分析形势，明确任务，提出措施，部署动员，把全民义务植树运动进一步引向深入，进一步加快林业发展，加快绿化祖国大地的进程；通过现场参观和介绍，请大家看一看广东的绿化，学一学广东的经验。
    会议回顾和分析了全国造林绿化和全民义务植树的形势后认为，７年来，各地区、各部门广大人民群众为贯彻五届全国人大四次会议作出的《关于开展全民义务植树运动的决议》，做了大量卓有成效的工作，每年植树季节，许多地方出现了千军万马齐上阵，大搞植树造林的动人场面。７年全民义务植树７０多亿株。“三北”防护林建设第一期工程已经完成，共造林９０００多万亩，第二期工程正在加紧进行。全国有２２３个县达到平原绿化标准。全国种草和改良草地已达１．６亿亩。全国城市绿化发展迅速，园林绿地的总面积已达２８万公顷，７年时间翻了一番。
    田纪云主持了这次会议并讲了话。他说，造林绿化和全民义务植树的形势好，并不是说没有问题。全民义务植树运动发展还很不平衡，现在每年大约义务植树１０亿株左右，参加植树的人数只相当于法定人数的１／３左右。有些乡村和城市的部分单位至今没有开展全民义务植树运动。有的地方对绿化国土任务的长期性、艰巨性缺乏足够的认识，造林绿化的劲头没有前几年那样大，产生了松劲和畏难情绪，绿化工作徘徊不前。这些问题应当引起我们的高度重视，迅速采取措施，及早加以解决。
    田纪云指出，加快林业发展，搞好国土绿化的根本，一是各级领导重视，真抓实干；一是广泛动员，全社会办绿化。这两个方面，缺一不可。他对今后一个时期造林绿化的基本任务和建立健全领导干部任期绿化目标责任制，认真制订造林绿化规划，切实做好林业“三防”，加强宣传工作等提出了明确要求。他热情赞扬了广东省从省委书记林若做起，各级领导亲自动手，狠抓林业的经验。
    广东省省委书记林若和副省长凌伯棠在会上发言，具体介绍了广东是怎样开展造林绿化工作的。
    全国绿化委员会副主任高德占、赵南起、林汉雄，各省、自治区、直辖市的省长或副省长、副主席、副市长以及林业厅局长参加了会议。
