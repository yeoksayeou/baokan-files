Europe is accelerating the development of the more powerful Ariane 5 rocket starting this year. This was announced by Jean Sollier, chairman of the European Engine Company, following the 28th successful launch of the Ariane rocket. He emphasized, "1989 will be a crucial year for the development of the Ariane 5 rocket."

The Ariane rocket is a large-scale launch vehicle developed by the European Space Agency, comprising 12 European countries including France, West Germany, and Italy. The currently used model is primarily the Ariane 4, which can launch multiple satellites into different orbits in a single mission. The Ariane 5 rocket, decided to be developed by the European Space Agency in November 1987, is a space launch vehicle for the 21st century. It is scheduled to conduct two test launches by 1995 and enter formal service in 1996.

According to the design, the Ariane 5 rocket is 50.5 meters high, with a diameter of 5.4 meters, and a total launch weight of 725 tons. It can send a 7-ton satellite into Earth orbit or transport a 21-ton "Hermes" spaceplane into a 500-kilometer low orbit.

Currently, the development work is fully underway. The main manufacturer of the Ariane rocket engines, the European Engine Company, has built a massive test stand and has conducted multiple tests on the low-temperature engines for the Ariane 5 rocket, which have a thrust exceeding 100 tons. Matra, responsible for all data processing and ground launch operations for this rocket and the "Hermes" spaceplane, has already formed a team of electronic engineers in Toulouse, France. Cryospace is developing a 5.4-meter diameter, 23-meter-high fuel tank that can hold 150 tons of fuel. The Italian company Snia is developing the ignition system and thermal insulation materials for the rocket engine. In French Guiana, construction has begun on a specialized launch base for this rocket.

The European Space Agency is now accelerating the development of the Ariane 5 rocket, considering that competition in the international space launch market will only intensify in the latter part of this century and the early part of the next. The French newspaper "Le Figaro" pointed out that in the future, the Ariane rocket will not only face competition from the United States and other European countries but also from countries like Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to have a more competitive new rocket. French Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Paul Quilès recently also emphasized that "Ariane rocket company and Europe must maintain their leading position in the face of potential competition."

　　欧洲加紧研制阿丽亚娜５型火箭
    预计１９９６年正式投入使用
    新华社巴黎１月３１日电  （记者茅瑞清）欧洲航天局自今年起将着手全面研制威力更大的新一代阿丽亚娜５型火箭。这是欧洲动力装置公司董事长让·索利埃在阿丽亚娜火箭第２８次成功发射后宣布的。他指出：“１９８９年将是研制阿丽亚娜５型火箭关键的一年”。
    阿丽亚娜火箭是法国、西德、意大利等１２个欧洲国家组成的欧洲航天局研制的大型运载工具。目前使用的主要是４型，它一次可运载多颗卫星并送入不同高度的轨道。阿丽亚娜５型火箭是欧洲航天局１９８７年１１月决定研制的２１世纪的航天运载工具，预计到１９９５年试射两次，１９９６年正式投入使用。
    根据设计，阿丽亚娜５型火箭高５０．５米，直径５．４米，起飞总重量达７２５吨，可把７吨重的卫星送入地球轨道，也可运送２１吨重的欧洲未来的“海尔梅斯号”航天飞机进入５００公里高的低轨道。
    现在，研制工作已全面展开。阿丽亚娜火箭发动机的主要生产厂家——欧洲动力装置公司已建成巨大的试验台，对用于阿丽亚娜５型火箭的、推力超过１００吨的低温发动机已进行多次试验。负责这种火箭和“海尔梅斯号”航天机的全部数据处理和地面发射事务的马特拉公司，已经在法国图卢兹市组成了有关的电子工程师小组。克里奥斯帕瑟公司正在研制直径５．４米、高２３米、可装１５０吨燃料的燃料罐，意大利斯尼亚公司则在研制火箭发动机的点火器和热绝缘材料，在法属圭亚那，为发射这种火箭的专门基地已开工兴建。
    欧洲航天局从现在起这样紧锣密鼓地研制阿丽亚娜５型火箭，是考虑到在本世纪末和下个世纪初这段时期里，国际航天运载工具市场上的竞争只会有增无减的形势。法国《费加罗报》指出，阿丽亚娜火箭在今后不仅要对付美国和其他欧洲国家的竞争，还将面临日本等国的挑战。因此，必须要拥有竞争力更强的新型火箭。法国邮电和航天部长保罗·基莱斯最近也强调“阿丽亚娜火箭公司和欧洲在可能出现的竞争面前必须保持其领先地位”。
