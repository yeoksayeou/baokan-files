The craze for billiards has swept into the mountains and villages of Xishuangbanna. It has brought new enjoyment to the ethnic minorities in our southwestern border regions, but it has also led some students to lose interest in their studies and fall into the trap of gambling.

    台球热风刮进了西双版纳的山野村寨。它给我国西南边疆的少数民族群众带来新的乐趣，可是也使一些小学生淡化了读书的兴趣，陷入了玩赌的泥潭。他们放下书包就泡在这台球桌上。
