The book "A Study on the Class Structure of China in the Primary Stage of Socialism" is a significant research outcome of the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" for social sciences in China. The book is edited by Gao Guang, Li Zhen, Ma Ming, and Wang Changyuan from the Central Party School, Jiangsu Provincial Party School, and Fujian Provincial Party School, and published by the Central Party School Press.

This work is a theoretical and practical book that is rare among similar works, and it is a scholarly monograph of high academic value. It reviews and reflects on the Marxist theory of class and its development in practice, examines the new explorations of contemporary socialist countries on this issue, and expands its scope to international experiences while focusing on the historical changes in China's economic and class structures during the primary stage of socialism. Based on the new economic structure of China, the authors propose that Chinese socialist society consists of the working class, collective farmers, intellectuals, and individual laborers, and they provide specific analyses of the historical changes, current status, and development trends of each class and stratum.

The authors point out: The working class has transformed from a previously oppressed and exploited class into the leading class of the state. The working class in a socialist society is composed of physical and mental laborers who collectively own the means of production and primarily rely on wages for their income. Its internal structure consists of the group of material producers, the stratum of intellectuals, and the stratum of managers. With the deepening of reforms, a part of enterprise leaders in the managerial stratum will gradually transform into entrepreneurs, forming a group of entrepreneurs in Chinese society. The peasant class in China has undergone three historical changes: land reform, collectivization, and rural economic system reform. With the transformation of the rural economy from a single public ownership form and management form to multiple management forms, and from a natural economy to a commodity economy, the peasantry is increasingly moving outward, with a large number of peasants entering the secondary and tertiary industries. Some of them have entered township enterprises and are in the process of transforming into the working class, forming a marginal stratum of "peasants-turned-workers" who have left the land but not the countryside. The intellectuals in China have achieved a historical transformation from a dependent position on a certain class to a part of the working class in a socialist society. The stratum of intellectuals is composed of three groups: those engaged in material production, those engaged in spiritual production, and those engaged in management and services. Intellectuals are the part of the working class with the highest cultural quality and play a special and important role in the modernization of socialist construction. Currently, individual laborers in urban and rural areas in China have formed an independent social stratum of laborers. Individual economy under socialist conditions is a form of personal ownership economy that complements socialist public ownership and is a necessary and beneficial supplement to the socialist economy. The authors have conducted detailed analyses of the social division of labor, labor methods, interest relationships, social functions, and value concepts of the above classes and strata.

It is particularly worth mentioning that in the monograph edited by Gao Guang and others, some chapters discuss issues that are entirely new situations and problems that have emerged in China's real life, with no previous works to refer to. For example, the issue of hired labor in the primary stage of socialism is one of them. The authors examine the phenomenon of hired labor, its historical evolution from ancient times to modern times, and the new characteristics of hired labor in the primary stage of socialism, as well as the pros and cons of this economic form and the attitude we should adopt towards it. In addition, the authors also discuss the new changes in the economic structure and class relations in economic special zones, open cities, and open regions, as well as the impact that the implementation of "one country, two systems" will have on China's social structure and national system, and present their independent views, demonstrating theoretical courage and innovative spirit.

The issue of class and stratum in Chinese socialist society is a very complex new topic, and its research has just begun. With the deepening of reform and opening up, new situations and new problems will continue to emerge. Therefore, we should not demand that the authors provide perfect explanations for all issues in this book, especially since changes in the economic structure and ownership structure will bring new changes to various classes and strata, which requires us to adapt to new situations and make new explorations. However, this monograph has indeed taken the first step in systematically investigating and deeply exploring this topic based on extensive surveys and research, and this pioneering research is worthy of full affirmation.

　　《中国社会主义初级阶段阶级结构研究》读后
    邢贲思
    《中国社会主义初级阶段阶级结构研究》一书，是我国社会科学“六五”规划一个重要课题的研究成果。该书由中共中央党校、江苏和福建省委党校高光、李真、马鸣、王昌远主编，中共中央党校出版社出版。
    这部著作，是一部理论联系实际的，在同类著作中不可多得的好书，是一部具有较高学术价值的专著。它回顾和反思了马克思主义关于阶级的理论及其在实践中的发展，考察了当代社会主义国家对这个问题的新探索，在把视野扩及到国际经验的同时，把研究的主要着眼点放在中国社会主义初级阶段经济结构和阶级结构所发生的历史性的新变化上。作者根据我国经济结构的新格局，提出了我国社会主义社会存在着工人阶级、集体农民、知识分子和个体劳动者等阶级和阶层，并且分别对各个阶级、阶层的历史变化、现状和发展趋势作了具体分析。
    作者指出：工人阶级已由过去被压迫被剥削的阶级变成了国家的领导阶级。社会主义社会的工人阶级是以社会或集体共同占有生产资料、以工资收入为主要来源的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者阶级。它的内部结构是由物质生产者群体、知识分子阶层和管理者阶层组成的。随着改革的深化，在管理者阶层中将有一部分企业的领导者转化为企业家，逐步形成中国社会的企业家集团。我国农民阶级经历了土改、合作化和农村经济体制改革三次历史性的变化。随着农村经济由单一的公有制形式和经营形式向多种经营形式、从自然型经济向商品型经济转变，农民队伍日益向外转移，大批农民进入第二、第三产业，其中一部分进入乡镇企业，正处于向工人阶级转化过程中，可以说形成了一个离土不离乡的“农民──工人”的边缘阶层。我国知识分子实现了从对某个阶级的依附地位到社会主义社会的工人阶级一部分的历史性转变。知识分子阶层由从事物质生产的知识分子群体、从事精神生产的知识分子群体和从事管理和服务的知识分子群体这三部分人构成。知识分子是工人阶级中文化素质最高的一部分，在社会主义现代化建设中具有特殊的重要作用。目前，我国城乡个体劳动者已经形成了一个独立劳动者的社会阶层。社会主义条件下的个体经济，是同社会主义公有制相联系的个人所有制经济，是社会主义经济的必要的有益的补充。作者对上述的阶级、阶层的社会分工、劳动方式、利益关系、社会功能以及价值观念等都作了详尽的分析。
    尤其值得提出的是，在高光等同志编写的这部专著中，有些章节所探讨的问题，完全是我国现实生活中出现的新情况和新问题，没有前人的著作可供参考。比如，社会主义初级阶段的雇工问题就是其中之一。作者考察了雇工这种现象，从古代到近代的历史演变和社会主义初级阶段的雇工的新特点，以及这种经济形式的利弊和我们对它应采取的态度。此外，对于经济特区、开放城市和开放地区的经济结构和阶级关系出现的新变化，以及“一国两制”实施后将给我国的社会结构和国家体制带来的影响等问题，作者也一一进行了探讨，提出了自己的独立见解，表现出了理论上的勇气和创新精神。
    我国社会主义社会的阶级、阶层问题，是一个极为复杂的新课题，对它的研究还刚刚开始，随着改革和开放的深入发展，新的情况和新的问题还会不断出现。因此，我们不能苛求作者在这本书中对各个问题的阐述都做到完美无缺，特别是由于经济结构和所有制结构的变动还会带来各阶级、阶层的新变化，这就要求我们适应新的形势不断作出新的探索。但这部专著毕竟在系统地调查研究基础上深入地探讨这个课题方面迈出了第一步，这种开拓性的研究是值得充分肯定的。
