The State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the management of international commercial loans, requiring all regions and departments to include foreign debt management in their agenda, seriously handle the use of foreign loans, ensure timely repayment, and maintain the country's international credit.

The main contents of the notice are as follows:

1. Strictly control the scale of foreign loans. All regions and departments must strictly implement the state's plan for utilizing foreign capital. Any department or unit that is not included in the state's plan for utilizing foreign capital and has not been approved by the People's Bank of China, is not allowed to borrow various forms of international commercial loans on their own, or to borrow from Chinese institutions and banks overseas. Without the approval of the foreign exchange management department, loans cannot be deposited overseas. If loans are signed without authorization, the contracts will not be effective, the foreign exchange management department will not handle the foreign debt registration, and banks will not open foreign exchange accounts for them. The principal and interest of the loans will not be allowed to be remitted out.

2. Implement balance management for short-term international commercial loans. Without state approval, the balance cannot exceed the approved amount. The excess part must be adjusted to within the approved limit within six months from the date of this notice; otherwise, the local foreign exchange management department will deduct the corresponding retained foreign exchange or the quota for medium and long-term international commercial loans, and force it to be used for repayment. Short-term foreign loans can only be used for working capital turnover and cannot be used for fixed asset investment projects.

3. Issuing bonds overseas must be within the state's plan for utilizing foreign capital and be approved by the People's Bank of China. The issuing unit must strictly follow the "Provisions on the Management of Issuing Bonds Overseas by Domestic Institutions in China" published by the People's Bank of China and report to the People's Bank of China for approval before issuing the bonds. Government departments issuing bonds in the international market must be approved by the State Council. Negotiations cannot be conducted without approval. The People's Bank of China should coordinate the work of domestic bond-issuing institutions entering the international market and carefully examine the conditions for issuing bonds overseas.

4. Strengthen the management of foreign exchange guarantees. The "Provisional Management Measures for Foreign Exchange Guarantees Provided by Domestic Institutions" published by the People's Bank of China must be strictly implemented. Enterprises providing foreign exchange guarantees must have sufficient self-owned foreign exchange as security, and the total amount of guarantees cannot exceed their self-owned foreign exchange funds. The total amount of foreign exchange guarantees provided by non-bank financial institutions and the total amount of foreign debts shall not exceed the limit specified by the People's Bank of China. Domestic institutions cannot provide foreign exchange guarantees to overseas institutions without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Government departments and public institutions are not allowed to provide foreign exchange guarantees.

5. Strictly review loan projects. For medium and long-term international commercial loan projects, the borrowing unit must conduct a feasibility study on the project's repayment capacity and economic benefits before borrowing, and clarify the repayment responsibility, which must be strictly evaluated by financial institutions. Projects that have not been approved by the state planning department, with matching RMB funds, energy supply, and transportation conditions not in place, are not allowed to borrow international commercial loans. Projects outside the state plan are not allowed to borrow international commercial loans. Domestic units' foreign loans generally cannot be used for foreign exchange-mortgaged RMB loans or enter the foreign exchange adjustment market. If there is a special need, it must be approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

6. Tighten the window for borrowing foreign debts. Except for the ten windows already determined by the state, namely, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the China Investment Bank, the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, the Fujian Investment Corporation, the Hainan International Trust and Investment Corporation, the Shanghai Investment Trust Corporation, the Tianjin International Trust and Investment Corporation, and the Dalian International Trust and Investment Corporation, no new windows for borrowing foreign debts will be approved in the future. Other regions, departments, and units borrowing international commercial loans must apply to the People's Bank of China on a case-by-case or special basis. The People's Bank of China should conduct a thorough cleanup and rectification of existing foreign loan units. All foreign loan windows and units approved by the People's Bank of China to borrow international commercial loans must handle foreign loan procedures in accordance with the relevant regulations of the People's Bank of China.

7. Further improve the foreign debt registration and statistical monitoring system. Whether directly borrowed from abroad or domestically transferred, all loans must be included in the national foreign debt statistical monitoring system for foreign debt registration to ensure that the state can implement macro-control over the scale and structure of foreign debts. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange should promptly formulate the registration and statistical monitoring methods for transferred loans. Those who do not handle or delay the registration procedures must be strictly punished in accordance with relevant regulations.

　　国务院发出通知    
    加强借用国际商业贷款管理
    新华社北京２月１４日电  国务院最近就加强借用国际商业贷款管理问题发出通知，要求各地、各部门把外债管理工作纳入议事日程，认真抓好对外借款的使用效益，保证债务能够按期偿还，以维护国家对外信誉。
    通知的主要内容是：一、严格控制对外借款规模。各地区、各部门要严格执行国家利用外资计划。凡未列入国家利用外资计划，未经中国人民银行总行批准，任何部门和单位不得自行对外借用各种形式的国际商业贷款，不得向我国在境外的机构和银行借款。未经外汇管理部门批准，不得将借款存放在境外。如擅自签约借款，其合同不能生效，外汇管理部门不予办理外债登记，银行不得为其开立外汇帐户，借款本息不准汇出。
    二、对借用短期国际商业贷款实行余额管理，未经国家批准，不得超过核准的余额。已超过部分，自本通知发出之日起，必须在半年内调整到核准的限额内，否则，由当地外汇管理部门扣减相应的留成外汇或借用中长期国际商业贷款指标，强制用于还款。短期对外借款只能用于流动资金周转，不得用于固定资产投资项目。
    三、在国外发行债券，必须在国家利用外资计划内，由中国人民银行批准发行债券的金融机构办理。发行债券的单位，必须严格按照中国人民银行公布的《关于中国境内机构在境外发行债券的管理规定》，在发债前报经中国人民银行批准。政府部门在国际市场上发行债券，须报经国务院批准。未经批准不得对外谈判。中国人民银行要做好国内发债机构进入国际市场发债的协调工作，认真审查在国外发债条件。
    四、加强对外汇担保的管理。必须严格执行中国人民银行公布的《境内机构提供外汇担保的暂行管理办法》。企业对外担保必须具备足够的自有外汇作保证，担保总额不得超过其自有外汇资金；非银行金融机构提供的外汇担保总额与对外债务总额之和，最高不得超过人民银行规定的限额。境内机构未经国家外汇管理局批准，不得为境外机构提供外汇担保。政府部门和事业单位不得对外提供外汇担保。
    五、严格审查借款项目。借用中长期国际商业贷款项目，借款单位在借款前，必须认真对项目的偿还能力和经济效益进行可行性研究，落实还款责任，并经金融机构严格评估。凡未经国家计划部门立项批准，配套人民币资金以及能源供应、交通条件等不落实的项目，不准借用国际商业贷款。国家计划外建设项目，不准借用国际商业贷款。国内单位的对外借款，一般不能用于外汇抵押人民币贷款，不能进入外汇调剂市场。如有特殊需要，须经国家外汇管理局审批。
    六、收紧借用外债的窗口。除国家已确定的中国银行、交通银行、中国国际信托投资公司、中国投资银行，以及广东国际信托投资公司、福建投资企业公司、海南国际信托投资公司、上海市投资信托公司、天津市国际信托投资公司、大连国际信托投资公司十个窗口以外，今后不再批准对外借用外债的窗口。其他地区、部门、单位对外债用国际商业贷款，需逐笔或专项向中国人民银行申请。中国人民银行要对现有对外借款单位进行认真清理整顿。各对外借款窗口，以及经中国人民银行批准的借用国际商业贷款的单位，必须按中国人民银行的有关规定办理对外借款手续。
    七、进一步完善外债登记和统计监测系统。不论是直接从境外筹借，还是国内转贷款，均要列入国家的外债统计监测系统，进行外债登记，以保证国家对外债规模、结构实行宏观监控。国家外汇管理局要尽快制定转贷款的登记和统计监测办法。对不办理或拖延办理登记手续的，必须严格按有关规定处罚。
