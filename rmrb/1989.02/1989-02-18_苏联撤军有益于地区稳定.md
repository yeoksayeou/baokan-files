The Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan provides an indispensable condition for the development of relations between the Soviet Union and its neighboring and surrounding countries. This region is predominantly composed of Islamic countries, which strongly condemn the Soviet Union's armed intervention in a Muslim brother country and support the Afghan people's struggle against the Soviets. Pakistan has provided strong support to the Afghan resistance movement and has taken in over 3 million Afghan refugees, bearing various pressures from the Soviet Union as a result. With the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, this grievance between the Soviet Union and Pakistan will be eliminated, and the two countries' relations will be able to develop more normally. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said after meeting with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vorontsov that once the Afghan conflict is resolved, Pakistan's relations with the Soviet Union will improve. There are reports that Pakistan will send a high-level delegation to the Soviet Union this year to sign economic, trade, scientific, and cultural agreements. Iran has taken in 2 million Afghan refugees and is the headquarters of the eight-party Shia alliance; Saudi Arabia provides financial aid to the Afghan resistance forces and one of the reasons it refuses to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is the Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan. Many countries in the Middle East hold similar views to Saudi Arabia. It can be foreseen that in the future, these countries' relations with the Soviet Union will also develop, which will be beneficial for the Soviet Union to expand its influence in the Middle East. As a neighboring country of Afghanistan, China has always been concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. With the resolution of the Afghan issue, one of the three major obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, Sino-Soviet relations will further improve.

The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan will also have some positive effects on the mutual relations between countries in the region. Afghanistan and Pakistan have shared hardships during the war, and their relations will be able to develop on a new basis after the war. India and Pakistan have taken diametrically opposed stances on the Afghan issue, and their conflicts have been exacerbated as a result. The elimination of this "hotspot" will naturally be beneficial to the already improving and easing relations between India and Pakistan.

As for the relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, they should be a new type of relationship different from the past. From the mid-1950s to the 1980s, over a span of 30 years, Afghanistan was the third-largest recipient of aid from the Soviet Union among developing countries. After the Soviet Union ends its occupation of Afghanistan, if the two countries' relations can be established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, they can be expected to develop healthily. However, the Soviet Union's adjustment of its policy towards Afghanistan is a slow, gradual process. Not long ago, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze said that if the fighting in Afghanistan does not stop after the Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union will continue to provide aid to the Kabul government. This shows that the Soviet Union is still unwilling to abandon its support for the Afghan People's Democratic Party. How the relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union will develop in the future will obviously depend on what policy the Soviet Union adopts towards Afghanistan.

　　苏联撤军有益于地区稳定
    中国国际问题研究所特约研究员  洪希诚
    苏联从阿富汗撤军，为苏联同其近邻和周边国家发展关系提供了不可缺少的条件。这一带大都是伊斯兰国家，它们强烈谴责苏联武装干涉一个穆斯林兄弟国家，支持阿富汗人民的抗苏斗争。巴基斯坦给阿抵抗运动以有力支援，收容３００多万阿富汗难民，为此承受了来自苏联的各方面的压力。随着苏军从阿富汗撤走，苏巴之间的这个芥蒂消除，两国关系将能较正常地向前发展。贝·布托总理在接见苏联副外长沃龙佐夫后说，一旦阿富汗冲突解决了，巴基斯坦同苏联的关系将得到改善。有报道说，巴年内将派高级代表团访苏签订经济、贸易、科学和文化协定。伊朗接纳了２００万阿难民，是阿什叶派八党联盟总部所在地；沙特阿拉伯向阿抵抗力量提供财政援助，它拒绝同苏联恢复外交关系的原因之一，即是苏对阿的军事占领。中东的许多国家都持与沙特相似的立场。可以想见，今后这些国家同苏联的关系亦将有所发展，从而有利于苏扩大其在中东的影响。中国作为阿富汗的一个邻国，一向关注阿的事态发展。作为中苏关系正常化三大障碍之一的阿富汗问题解决后，中苏关系将进一步改善。
    苏联撤军对地区各国间的相互关系也将产生某些积极作用。阿富汗和巴基斯坦在战争岁月，患难与共，战后两国关系将能在一个新基础上不断发展。印巴对阿问题的态度截然不同，两国的矛盾曾因之而有所加剧，这个“热点”的消除对业已开始走向缓和与改善的印巴关系自然也有助益。
    至于苏联和阿富汗的关系，按理说应是与过去不同的新型关系。从５０年代中期到８０年代中的３０年间，阿富汗在发展中国家里是苏联的第三大受援国。苏结束对阿占领后，两国关系如能建立在平等互利原则之上，可望得到健康发展。但是苏对阿政策的调整是个缓慢的渐变过程。前不久，苏联谢瓦尔德纳泽外长还说：苏撤军后如果阿境内战事依然不停，苏将继续向喀布尔政府提供援助。这说明，苏仍不肯放弃对阿人民民主党的支持。今后阿苏关系如何发展，显然将取决于苏对阿采取何种政策。
