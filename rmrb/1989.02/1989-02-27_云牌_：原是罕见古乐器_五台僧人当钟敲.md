The "Cloud Plaque" used by monks of Mount Wutai to strike as a bell has been found by experts to produce beautiful music. Professor Ding Shizhang of the Physics Department at Shanxi University and other experts and scholars have studied the "Cloud Plaque" and concluded that it is an ancient percussion instrument that conforms to the principles of acoustics.

Investigations reveal that the "Cloud Plaque" was cast in 1603. It is shaped like two interlocking long-life locks, standing 233.57 centimeters high, 173.5 centimeters wide, and 7.43 centimeters thick. It is composed of 31 iron plates of varying sizes and shapes, with 28 of these plates bearing designs of dragons playing with pearls, flowers, grass, and cloud patterns. Ding Shizhang and his team used instruments to test the "Cloud Plaque" multiple times and discovered that it has 13 different frequencies. Moreover, each frequency corresponds with the names of ancient Chinese musical scales and contemporary musical notes, meaning it can produce the modern musical notes "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol..."

The discovery of the "Cloud Plaque" instrument is of significant importance for the study of Chinese music and musical instruments. Currently, this research topic has been included in the national natural science fund project.

　　“云牌”：原是罕见古乐器  五台僧人当钟敲
    五台山和尚当钟敲的“云牌”，专家们却敲出了优美的乐曲。山西大学物理系副教授丁士章等专家、学者经研究认为，这个“云牌”原来是一种很符合声学原理的古代打击乐器。
    据考查，这个“云牌”铸造于１６０３年。它形如两个连在一起的长命锁，高２３３．５７厘米、宽１７３．５厘米、厚７．４３厘米，由大小不等、形状不同的３１块铁板拼铸而成，其中２８块铁板上铸有二龙戏珠、花、草、云纹等图案。丁士章等用仪器多次测试，发现整个“云牌”有１３个不同的频率。而且每个频率与中国古代音乐律名、当代音乐唱名基本吻合，即它可以敲出今日音乐唱名“多、来、米、发、梭……”。
    “云牌”乐器的发现，对于研究我国音乐、乐器等都有重要意义。目前，这个课题已列入国家自然科学基金项目。
