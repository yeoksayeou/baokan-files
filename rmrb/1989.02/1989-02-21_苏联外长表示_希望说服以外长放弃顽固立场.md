Soviet Foreign Minister Hopes to Persuade Israeli Foreign Minister to Abandon Stubborn Stance

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 20th - Egyptian President Mubarak held talks with visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze on the Middle East issue on the 20th.

Egypt is the third stop on Shevardnadze's Middle East tour, having previously visited Syria and Jordan.

Upon arriving in Cairo on the 19th, Shevardnadze told reporters at the airport: "Solving the Middle East problem requires the joint efforts of the UN Security Council and the relevant parties. I hope this issue can make progress."

He hopes to persuade Israeli Foreign Minister Arens to abandon his "stubborn stance" and reach a peace agreement with the Arabs during their meeting.

On the 18th, during his visit to Damascus, Shevardnadze proposed that the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council hold a special meeting to prepare for the international peace conference on the Middle East to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.

During his 10-day Middle East tour, Shevardnadze will also visit Iraq and Iran.

February 20th, Egyptian President Mubarak held talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in Cairo. This is the first time in 15 years that a Soviet foreign minister has visited Egypt.
