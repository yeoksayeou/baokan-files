The alleys are joyous with your silver attire.
The city is transformed into a pristine wilderness by you.
Majestic mountains say, you are an invitation to spring. The azure sea says, you are a captivating page from a Grimm fairy tale. The earth and the sky say, you are the world that eradicates germs.

Winter snow, as you tirelessly flit through the changing stars, covering the worn-out gullies, the fences no longer belong to this day or night. However, when fools lament that your endeavor seems pale, philosophers are coldly imagining the hot semen flowing in the anemic skull...

	Winter Song

It is the steep slope of the smooth road tilting downwards, the reddened fingers kneading out the waves, the boiling hot pot on the excited dining table, the robust song thrown by the thick cotton jacket and thin cotton pants...

Yesterday's gala presented a blaze of fire in the winter. Today's stage, should it not present a lock for the coldest days of the year? Lock away confusion, lock away hardships, but do not lock away the relentless pursuit of thought.

Indeed, the sun and the moon shine brilliantly as scheduled, and frost and snow also descend grandly as planned. In the Garden of Eden of life, there is cold and heat, confusion and choice. Everyone should go and listen to and sing the winter song of the snow city...

　　冬日雪（外一章）
    郑一
    街巷因你披挂银装的喜悦。
    都市因你弥漫成洁白的原野。
    巍峨的山说，你是寄往春天的请帖。蔚蓝的海说，你是格林童话精彩的一页。大地和天空说，你是扼杀菌孽的世界。
    冬日雪，当你在斗转星移中奔忙不歇，飘满憔悴了的沟堑，栅栏就不再属于这天这夜了。然而，当愚者感叹你从事着的似乎是苍白的事业，哲人却正冷峻地想象那贫血的颅腔里流淌着热腾的精液……
    　　　　冬季歌
    是光滑的路面倾斜下来的陡坡，是发红的手指揉搓出来的浪波，是兴奋的餐桌沸腾起来的火锅，是厚棉袄薄棉裤甩来的壮歌……
    昨天的晚会，捧出了冬天里的一把火。今天的舞台，是不是该推出三九天的一把锁。锁住迷惘，锁住坎坷，可别锁住一往无前的思索。
    的确，太阳和月亮如期辉煌的闪烁着，霜和雪也如期隆重地降落，人生的伊甸园里，有冷有热，有困惑也有选择。大家还是去听一听唱一唱雪城里的冬季歌吧……
