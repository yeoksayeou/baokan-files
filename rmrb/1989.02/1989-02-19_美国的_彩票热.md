The United States is currently experiencing a phenomenon where lottery winners often become overnight millionaires. Today, from adults to children, from black to white, everyone is caught up in the "lottery fever." All 28 states and the District of Columbia have lottery activities, and 4 more states will vote in November on whether to start similar activities. In 1987, the total lottery revenue nationwide reached $12.8 billion.

Opinions on lottery activities are mixed, with both supporters and opponents.

Supporters argue that lottery activities can provide new revenue for local governments with minimal risk. Of the total lottery income, 50% is used for prizes, 11% for management fees, and the remaining 39% can be used by local governments for education, transportation, public funds, and urban construction. In 1986, when California experienced a teachers' strike, the state government used 34% of the lottery revenue to significantly increase teachers' salaries and provide schools with computers and laboratory equipment.

Opponents, however, believe that lottery activities are not worth the trouble and will inevitably lead to a series of social problems. Economist Ronald Fischer of the University of Michigan points out that the claim that lottery activities are a panacea for increasing local government revenue is unfounded. In every dollar of national fiscal revenue, lottery income accounts for only a few cents. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, in 1986, the 22 states with lotteries had an average of only 1.9 cents per dollar of state revenue from lotteries.

Sociologists argue that the media and lottery advertisements promote the stories of a few people becoming millionaires overnight, while ignoring the majority who spend $100 a week on lotteries but never win a cent. Surveys show that the poorer people are, the more they spend on lotteries. For example, in California, the poor spend 2.1% of their income on lotteries, while the rich spend only 0.3%; in Maryland, blacks spend $4.5 more per week on lotteries than whites.

Statistics show that 4% of lottery buyers have developed a "lottery addiction." A man named Jack spends $300 to $400 a week on lotteries. To buy lotteries, he even embezzled $14,000 in public funds. He admitted, "The threats of being arrested, imprisoned, and losing my wife could not stop me from buying lotteries."

Now, educators are increasingly concerned that more and more young people are joining the lottery crowd. They point out that buying lotteries is a convenient and time-saving form of "gambling." It might be difficult for a 15-year-old to enter a racetrack or drive to Atlantic City, but he can easily walk into a store and buy a lottery ticket for $10.

What worries the states the most is that lotteries may lead to corruption and crime. In Pennsylvania, two men were arrested for using a computer to forge winning lottery tickets and attempting to claim $15 million in prizes. Even genuine lottery winners may commit crimes. In July, police in Florida arrested a $5 million winner for attempting to harm her daughter-in-law. Her son said she was so excited about winning such a large sum of money that she became somewhat mentally unstable.

### 美国的“彩票热”

　　美国的“彩票热”
    李松
    今日美国，经常流传着中彩者一夜之间成为百万富翁的故事。如今，从成人到孩子，从黑人到白人都卷入了“彩票热”，全国的２８个州和哥伦比亚特区都有抽彩中奖活动，还有４个州将于１１月表决通过是否也开展这一活动。１９８７年全国彩票收入高达１２８亿美元。
    人们对于抽彩中奖活动评价不一，众说纷纭，赞同者有之，反对者亦不少。
    赞同者认为：抽彩中奖活动可为地方财政增加新的收入，且很少风险。在彩票总收入中，除５０％用于奖金，１１％用于管理费之外，余下的３９％地方政府可用于教育、交通、公共基金和城镇建设等。１９８６年加利福尼亚州发生教师罢课游行，州政府为了将教师吸引回教室，拿彩票收入的３４％给教师大幅度增加了工资，并为学校添置了计算机、实验室设备等。
    反对者则认为，抽彩中奖活动得不偿失，它势必引起一系列社会问题。密执根大学经济学家罗纳德·费希尔指出：宣称抽彩中奖活动是增加地方财政收入的灵丹妙药的说法，是违背事实的。在每一美元的国家财政收入中，彩票收入不过仅占几分钱。根据美国统计局的数字，１９８６年有抽彩中奖的２２个州，在州收入的每一美元当中，彩票收入平均仅占１．９美分。
    社会学家认为，宣传媒介和彩票广告渲染了一日间成为百万富翁的少数人的故事，而避口不谈那些每周都拿出１００美元买彩票却一分钱也收不回来的大多数人。据调查表明，越是穷人却越是从收入中拿出较大份额购买彩票，如加利福尼亚州，穷人拿出工资的２．１％购买彩票，富人仅为０．３％；马里兰州的黑人每周比白人多付出４．５美元买彩票。
    据统计，在购买彩票的人中有４％已染上了“彩票瘾”。一位名叫杰克的人每周都要拿出３００至４００美元购买彩票。为买彩票，他甚至盗用了１．４万美元的公款。他坦白地说：“被捕、坐牢和失去老婆的威胁，都不能让我放弃买彩票的嗜好。”
    现在，令教育工作者感到十分忧虑的是，越来越多的青少年也加入了买彩票大军。他们指出：买彩票是一种方便省时的“赌博”。一个１５岁的孩子进入赛马场或开车去大西洋赌城，也许不是一件容易的事，然而他可以随便走进一家商店，花上１０美元购买一张彩票。
    令各州最为恐惧的是，抽彩中奖也许会引起腐败和犯罪。宾夕法尼亚州两名男子用计算机伪造中奖彩票，去冒领１５００万美元的奖金时被捕。就是真正的中彩者也有可能犯罪。７月，佛罗里达州的警方逮捕了一名５００万美元的中奖者，指控她企图谋害她的儿媳妇。她的儿子说她因得到这么一大笔钱而兴奋得有些神志错乱了。
