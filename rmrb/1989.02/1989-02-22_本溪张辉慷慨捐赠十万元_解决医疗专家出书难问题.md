Author: Sī Xiángchūn

Edition: 6

Zhang Hui, a folk doctor from Benxi, has learned many prescriptions and experiences for treating tumors from his maternal grandfather since he was young. More than ten years ago, he began practicing medicine in the countryside, specializing in late-stage cancers that hospitals do not treat. Due to his diligent study and bold exploration, he has achieved some results in treating "incurable diseases." However, he lacks a solid foundation in medical knowledge, so he has traveled to Shenyang and Beijing, seeking teachers and learning skills everywhere.

In October 1988, he learned that several dozen experts who had devoted their efforts to writing the first edition of "Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Oncology" in China encountered difficulties in publishing the book. This folk doctor, who usually dresses simply, saves money, and now lives with three generations and four people in a single room, immediately contacted the authors and expressed his willingness to contribute funds to complete this good deed. In a telegram sent to Chen Wenyi, the chief editor of the book and director of the Chengdu Military Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Oncology, he wrote: "Determined to conquer cancer; prioritize the cause, spare no expense." Through the efforts of many parties, Zhang Hui's wish came true.

On December 2, 1988, Zhang Hui personally handed over 100,000 yuan to Chen Wenyi. Chen Wenyi said that he plans to use half of the funds to publish the book and the other half as a reward fund for the Oncology Research Society.

　　本溪张辉慷慨捐赠十万元　解决医疗专家出书难问题
    我省本溪市民间医生张辉自小从外祖父那里学到了许多治疗肿瘤的药方和经验。１０多年前，他开始在民间行医，专攻一些医院不治疗的晚期癌症。由于他刻苦钻研，勇于探索，在治疗“不治之症”中取得了一些成果。但是，他苦于自己医疗基础知识底子薄，因此先后跑沈阳，进北京，四处求师学艺。
    １９８８年１０月，他得知几十名专家花费心血写成的我国第一部《中西医结合肿瘤学》出版遇到困难后，这个平时衣着简朴，省吃俭用，如今还三代４口人同居一个单室的民间医生，立即与著书者联系，愿意出资成全这桩好事。他在发给这本书的主编、成都军区中医肿瘤研究所所长陈文义的电报中说：“攻克癌症，矢志不移；事业至上，万金不惜。”经多方努力，张辉如愿以偿。
    １９８８年１２月２日，张辉亲手将１０万元巨款交给陈文义。陈文义说，打算用这笔款的一半出书，另一半将作为肿瘤研究会的奖励基金。
