In the Shanghai suburbs, where land is scarce, one often encounters patches of idle, uncultivated land. These patches may be hidden among crops, concealed within walls, or exposed along the sides of roads. The barren land around towns, near factories, around fishponds, and beside village houses is even more ubiquitous. Currently, arable land in our country is decreasing day by day, yet the phenomenon of abandoned farmland in many places is becoming increasingly severe.

The fundamental cause of idle land is the lack of a sense of land conservation, from urban to rural areas. For the units that requisition land, it seems that as long as they have paid the relevant fees, whether the land is abandoned or not has no impact on their interests. For village cadres and farmers, it is more profitable to invest time and energy in other money-making ventures than in farming. A little less farming and a little less harvest do not matter.

Experience shows that as long as the leaders of various levels of departments pay attention, the current phenomenon of abandoned farmland in rural areas is not an incurable or difficult-to-cure disease. In the autumn of last year, Chuansha County took different measures for different subjects: for township enterprise workers who did not cultivate their contracted land well, they were not allowed to go to work; for individual business owners who went out to work, the industrial and commercial departments would confiscate their business licenses if they did not cultivate their contracted land well; for households that truly lacked labor, the collective would provide assistance (cultivation); and they listed the elimination of idle land as an indicator for evaluating grassroots cadres, linking it with rewards and punishments. As a result, more than 20,000 mu of idle land in the entire county were all planted with wheat and rapeseed.

Some people engaged in rural work and studying rural economics in this area suggest that for those units that requisitioned land without proper conditions, resulting in long-term abandonment, the local government should also intervene with administrative and economic measures. Otherwise, it will not be possible to effectively stop the phenomenon of requisitioning land without using it or using it less.

### 上海一些农村工作者建议　用行政和经济手段制止撂荒

　　上海一些农村工作者建议
　　用行政和经济手段制止撂荒
    据新华社上海２月９日电  （记者孙洪祥）在寸土如金的上海郊区，人们每每可以发现一块块寸苗不长的闲荒地，或隐没于禾苗中，或藏匿于围墙内，或暴露于公路两侧；那集镇周围、工厂附近、鱼塘四周、村落宅基旁的空白地，更是随处可见。当前我国耕地日趋减少，而不少地方撂荒现象却越来越严重。
    造成闲荒地的根本原因是：从城市到农村普遍缺乏珍惜土地的思想。对征地单位来说，似乎觉得已交了有关费用，荒与不荒丝毫不影响他的利益；对村干部和农民来说，把时间和精力花到其它生财门路上远比种田合算，少种一点、少收一点无所谓。
    经验表明，只要各级部门领导重视，当前农村中的撂荒现象并非是不治或难治之症。川沙县在去年秋播中区别不同对象，对乡镇企业职工不种好承包田不准上班、对外出个体户不种好承包田由工商部门扣留营业执照、对确实缺乏劳动力农户由集体进行扶耕（种）；并且把消灭闲荒地列入考核农村基层干部指标，与奖罚挂起钩来。结果，全县两万余亩闲荒地都种了麦子、油菜。
    此间一些从事农村工作和研究农村经济的人士建议，对于那些未具备条件而先行征用耕地、导致长期闲荒的单位，当地政府也应该采取行政的和经济的手段加以干预，否则将不能有效地制止这种征而不用或多征少用现象的出现。
