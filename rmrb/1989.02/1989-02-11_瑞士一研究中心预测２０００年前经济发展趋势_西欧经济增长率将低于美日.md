A Swiss research center has predicted the economic development trends in Western Europe before the year 2000, stating that the annual average economic growth rate of the European Economic Community (EEC) will be 2.4% from 1987 to 1993, and 2.6% from 1993 to 2000, both of which will be lower than the growth rates of Japan and the United States (3.5% and 2.9%, respectively).

This prediction comes from the Prognos Economic Situation Research Center based in Basel, Switzerland. The center specializes in researching, analyzing, and predicting international economic situations, particularly those in Europe, and is highly regarded in the international economic community. In a report released yesterday, the center stated that the realization of a unified European market in 1992 will aid in the economic development of the EEC, but cautioned against being overly optimistic. The report noted that while measures such as the elimination of tariff controls and the standardization of trade practices will undoubtedly promote the economic and trade development of the EEC, it is uncertain whether all 300-plus related agreements will be implemented by the end of 1992.

The Delors Report published by the EEC Commission predicts that the EEC's annual average economic growth rate will be 5% from 1993 to 1998. The Prognos report, however, points out that this estimate is "overly optimistic." It believes that such a significant increase in the EEC's economy cannot be expected before the year 2000.

The Prognos report also states that countries in Western Europe with lower incomes, such as Spain, Portugal, and Greece, will experience faster economic growth from 1993 to 2000, with growth rates potentially reaching 3.5% to 4%. The report predicts that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark will have the slowest growth rates in Western Europe, possibly around 2% or less.

　　瑞士一研究中心预测２０００年前经济发展趋势    
    西欧经济增长率将低于美日
    新华社日内瓦２月１０日电  （记者向奎观）欧洲共同体经济年平均增长率在１９８７年至１９９３年期间将达到２．４％，１９９３年至２０００年期间将达到２．６％，低于日本和美国的增长率（３．５％和２．９％）。
    这是瑞士普罗尼奥斯经济形势研究中心在预测西欧各国２０００年前经济发展趋势时发表的看法。
    总部设在巴塞尔的普罗尼奥斯研究中心专门研究、分析和预测国际经济形势，特别是欧洲经济形势，颇受国际经济界重视。这家研究中心在昨天发表的报告中说，１９９２年实现欧洲统一市场有助于欧共体经济发展，但对此“不能过分乐观”。报告认为，取消关税控制、统一贸易标准等措施无疑能促进欧共体经济贸易的发展，但是它的３００多项有关协定到１９９２年底不一定都能生效。
    欧共体委员会发表的塞希尼报告预测，１９９３年至１９９８年期间欧共体的经济年平均增长率为５％。普罗尼奥斯研究中心报告指出，这种估计“过分乐观”。它认为，在２０００年前不能期待欧共体的经济有这样大的幅度的增长。
    普罗尼奥斯中心的报告说，西班牙、葡萄牙、希腊等西欧低收入国家在１９９３年至２０００年期间经济增长将较快，增长率可达到３．５％到４％。它预测比利时、荷兰和丹麦的增长速度将是西欧各国最慢的，可能只有２％左右。
