The Inner Mongolia Architectural School is a secondary vocational school under the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Construction Department. With the approval of relevant departments, the school started offering undergraduate and junior college programs in 1979. In February 1982, to solve the employment problem of the children of the school's faculty and staff, the Architectural School stipulated that children of faculty and staff who failed the college entrance examination could enroll in the school as transfer students. At that time, the original principal proposed that upon graduation, diplomas could be issued, but this was not approved by the relevant departments.

In October 1984, Zhao Xiangyi became the principal of the Architectural School. His two daughters did not pass the college entrance examination and were enrolled as transfer students in the architectural engineering major. According to the regulations of the State Education Commission, after completing the coursework and passing the exams, a certificate of completion could be issued. However, when his two daughters completed their studies, they were issued undergraduate diplomas and master's degree certificates. At the same time, Zhao Xiangyi's two daughters also completed the formal graduate registration procedures. To silence others, Zhao Xiangyi also issued diplomas to seven other transfer students.

Before enrolling as a transfer student, one of Zhao Xiangyi's daughters was an apprentice at the Inner Mongolia First Construction Company. After completing her studies, Zhao Xiangyi transferred her to the Architectural School as a teacher, increasing her monthly salary from over 40 yuan to 76 yuan, and she enjoyed all the school's benefits. Zhao Xiangyi also required the school's academic affairs office to pay his daughter 4 yuan per class for teaching, which was rejected by the original head of the academic affairs office. After completing her studies, Zhao Xiangyi's other daughter worked in the school's design office. Three months later, Zhao Xiangyi increased her salary from 58 yuan to 70 yuan.

In August 1987, two teachers from the Architectural School exposed Zhao Xiangyi's problems to the relevant departments. After an investigation by the Party Committee of the Construction Department of the Autonomous Region, it was found that the exposure materials of the two teachers were completely true. On April 18, 1988, the Construction Department of the Autonomous Region issued a document ordering Zhao Xiangyi to recall the nine diplomas he had issued by the end of June, declare the issued diplomas and degree certificates invalid, write a self-criticism, and make a public self-criticism at the school's faculty and staff meeting.

The Party Committee of the Architectural School held a meeting to study and implement the decision of the departmental Party Committee, but Zhao Xiangyi refused to participate. Zhao Xiangyi declared, "I would rather not be the principal than recall the diplomas." On June 30 and July 9, the leaders of the Construction Department had two talks with Zhao Xiangyi, pointing out that the departmental Party Committee's document must be implemented. However, Zhao Xiangyi not only refused to comply but also issued undergraduate diplomas to nine transfer students who had not taken the entrance examination by the end of July, and issued master's degree certificates to three of them; he also issued junior college diplomas to 17 people who had not taken the entrance examination and middle school diplomas to five people.

Most of these students who obtained diplomas without taking the entrance examination were children of the school's faculty and staff, and some were children of employees from other units who had personal relationships with Zhao Xiangyi. Among these students, some had several courses, even more than ten, with no grades or failing grades.

The son of a deputy director of the Higher Education Section of the Autonomous Region Education Department was enrolled in the school's undergraduate program in 1984. During his time at the school, he violated school rules multiple times. In early 1988, he was caught cheating on exams, and the school revoked his transfer student status and made it public. His father, in order to help him obtain a diploma, wrote a letter to Zhao Xiangyi and others on May 27, 1988, openly requesting the school leadership to "provide strong assistance." In the end, this deputy director's son obtained an undergraduate diploma.

Due to Zhao Xiangyi's refusal to implement the decision of the departmental Party Committee and continued issuance of diplomas, the Construction Department of the Autonomous Region decided on August 1, 1988, to transfer Zhao Xiangyi out of the Architectural School.

On August 9, the leaders of the Construction Department had a talk with Zhao Xiangyi, who expressed his willingness to follow the organizational decision but requested a delay. However, Zhao Xiangyi, without waiting for the formal announcement from the Construction Department, leaked the decision to relevant personnel. Some people who were unaware of the situation wrote letters to the relevant departments, requesting to retain Zhao Xiangyi. Zhao Xiangyi also used his personal connections to hold a press conference, claiming to be a reformer, and publicly refuted the department's decision, declaring that issuing diplomas was not wrong.

On the afternoon of August 11, the main leader of the Construction Department formally announced the decision to transfer Zhao Xiangyi's work at the Architectural School. However, less than an hour after the announcement, the Autonomous Region Labor and Personnel Department suddenly called, requesting that the decision not be announced. When the relevant departments learned that the decision had been announced, they notified the Construction Department to suspend the implementation. On August 25, the Party Committee of the Construction Department decided to suspend the transfer of Zhao Xiangyi's work.

The Construction Department made two decisions to handle and transfer the work of a subordinate department-level cadre, but neither was implemented. During the reporter's investigation, Zhao Xiangyi was still the principal of the Architectural School.

However, the lives of some colleagues who exposed Zhao Xiangyi's problems to the relevant departments were not easy.

The son of a worker returned to Hohhot in October 1987 after being demobilized and was arranged to work at the Architectural School according to policy and with the approval of the relevant departments. Because this worker had exposed Zhao Xiangyi's problems multiple times, Zhao Xiangyi refused to accept him. The Personnel Department of the Construction Department repeatedly notified, but Zhao Xiangyi still ignored it. To this day, this worker's son is still a "black person" with no household registration and no food rations.

After graduating from a vocational high school majoring in library science, the daughter of a worker worked in the library of the Architectural School. Because her father sent a letter exposing Zhao Xiangyi to the relevant departments, this girl, who had only worked for six months, had her salary stopped by Zhao Xiangyi.

On January 10, in the office of the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Architectural School, Zhao Xiangyi, in the presence of several key leaders of the school, scolded a senior lecturer and even threw a cigarette ashtray and used physical force. Naturally, this senior lecturer had also exposed Zhao Xiangyi's problems.

　　滥发大学毕业证之后
    本报记者  傅钉根
    弄虚作假　偷梁换柱
    内蒙古建筑学校是内蒙古自治区建设厅系统的一所中等专业学校。经有关部门批准，自１９７９年起，这所学校开办了大学本科班和专科班。１９８２年２月，为解决学校教职工子女的就业问题，建筑学校规定，高考落榜的本校教职工子女可以插班学习。当时，原校长提出，毕业后争取发给毕业证，但没有得到有关部门的批准。
    １９８４年１０月，赵向毅任建筑学校校长。他的两个女儿没考上大学，先后进入建筑学专业插班学习。按照国家教委规定，学习期满考试合格后，可发给结业证书。他的两个女儿结业时，竟取得了本科毕业证书，并获取了学士学位证书。同时，赵向毅的两个女儿还按正式学员办理了毕业生登记手续。为了堵别人的嘴，赵向毅又给另外７名插班生也发了毕业证书。
    赵向毅的一个女儿插班学习之前，原是内蒙古第一建筑公司学徒工，结业后，赵向毅将她借调到建筑学校任教员，月工资由原来的４０多元提到７６元，并享受学校的一切福利待遇。赵向毅还要求学校教务科按每节课４元钱给他女儿发讲课费，这一要求遭到了原教务科长的拒绝。赵向毅的另一个女儿结业后，留在学校设计室工作，３个月之后，赵向毅就将她的工资从５８元提到７０元。
    　　　　上级决定　拒不执行
    １９８７年８月，建筑学校两位教师向有关部门揭发了赵向毅的问题。经自治区建设厅党组调查，两位教师的揭发材料完全属实。１９８８年４月１８日，自治区建设厅下达文件，责令赵向毅在６月底以前收回擅自发出的９份毕业证书，宣布所发毕业证书和学位证书无效，让赵向毅写出书面检查，并在全校教职员工会上公开作检查。
    建筑学校党委曾召开党委会，研究贯彻厅党组的决定，但赵向毅拒绝参加。赵向毅扬言：“宁可不当校长，也不收回毕业证书。”６月３０日和７月９日，建设厅领导人两次找赵向毅谈话，指出厅党组的文件必须执行。然而，赵向毅不仅拒不执行，反而于７月底又给未经入学考试的９名插班生发了大学本科毕业证，同时给其中３人发了学士学位证书；另给未经入学考试的１７人发了大学专科毕业证书，给５人发了中专毕业证书。
    这些不经入学考试而得到毕业证的学生，大部分是建筑学校教职工的子女，个别人是与赵向毅有私人关系的外单位职工的子女。这些学生中，有的人有好几门课程，甚至１０多门课程无成绩或不及格。
    自治区教育厅高教二处一个副处长的儿子，１９８４年插入这所学校本科班学习，在校期间，他多次违犯校规，１９８８年初，又因考试作弊，学校取消了他的插班生资格，并公布于众。他的父亲为了使他获得毕业证，于１９８８年５月２７日给赵向毅等人写信，公开要求学校领导人“大力帮忙”。最后，这位副处长的儿子竟获得了大学本科毕业证书。
    　　　　暂缓执行　遥遥无期
    由于赵向毅拒不执行建设厅党组的决定，并继续滥发毕业证书，１９８８年８月１日，自治区建设厅决定将赵向毅调离建筑学校。
    ８月９日，建设厅领导同志找赵向毅谈话，赵表示服从组织决定，但要求缓一缓。然而，赵向毅没等建设厅正式宣布，便向有关人员透露了这一决定。一些不了解内情的人便联名向有关部门写信，要求挽留赵向毅。赵向毅还利用个人关系，召开记者招待会，称自己是改革家，并对建设厅的决定逐条驳斥，公开宣称发放毕业证没有错误。
    １９８８年８月１１日下午，建设厅主要领导人在建筑学校正式宣布了调动赵向毅工作的决定。但是，这一决定宣布之后不到１小时，自治区劳动人事厅突然打来一个电话，要求不要宣布这一决定。当有关部门得知这一决定已经宣布时，便通知建设厅暂缓执行。８月２５日，建设厅党组决定，暂缓调动赵向毅的工作。
    建设厅对下属的一个处级干部，先后两次作出处理和工作调动决定，但都没有得到执行。在记者调查时，赵向毅仍是建筑学校校长。
    然而，向有关部门揭发赵向毅问题的一些同志的日子就不好过了。
    一位职工的儿子１９８７年１０月复员回呼和浩特市后，按政策规定，并经有关部门批准，被安排在建筑学校工作。由于这位职工多次揭发过赵向毅的问题，赵向毅就是顶着不接收。建设厅人事处再三通知，赵向毅仍然置之不理。至今，这位职工的儿子还是无户口无粮吃的“黑人”。
    一位职工的女儿职业高中图书专业毕业后，在建筑学校图书馆工作。由于她父亲给有关部门送了一份揭发赵向毅的信，这个姑娘仅仅工作了６个月，赵向毅就停发了她的工资。
    今年１月１０日，在建筑学校党委副书记办公室，赵向毅当着学校几位主要领导同志的面，对一位高级讲师破口大骂，并操起烟缸，动起手脚。自然，这位高级讲师也揭发过赵向毅的问题。
