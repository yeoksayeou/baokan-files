	The Money View of Americans

	How much importance do Americans generally place on money? Can they do anything for money? The *USA Today* conducted a survey of 10,000 readers. The conclusion is: money is not everything; there are many things more precious than money in the world. A few people with money can do anything, but most people have some things they won't do no matter how much money is offered.

	When asked what to do if an ATM mistakenly dispenses an extra $1,000, 52% of respondents said they would immediately return the money to the bank; 23% said they would consider it but ultimately return the money; 16% said they would keep the money and be happy with their good luck; 9% said, after some hesitation, they would decide to keep the money without saying anything, but would feel guilty.

	When asked about the best investment of their lives, some people mentioned stocks, while others mentioned real estate. However, many men gave a more consistent answer: the best investment of their lives was finding a good wife.

	Most Americans, when buying things, first consider the quality of the product. Only 15% of respondents said they only consider the price when buying things.

	This survey shows that when choosing a partner, very few people consider how much money the other person makes. This proportion is 78%. They think that money is important, but this issue is not important to them when choosing a partner.

　　美国人的金钱观
    金钱在一般美国人心目中到底占多大比重？是不是为了金钱什么都可以干？《今日美国报》曾对一点一万名读者作了一次调查。结论是：金钱并不是一切，世界上还有许多东西比金钱更宝贵。少数人有了钱什么都可以干，但是，大多数人有些事给多少钱也不能干。
    当问及如果银行的自动取款机出了毛病，多付给你一千美元该怎么办时，有百分之五十二的人表示应该立即将钱还给银行；百分之二十三的人表示要考虑一下，但是最终要还给银行；百分之十六的人表示要将钱拿走，并庆幸今天交了好运；百分之九的人表示，经过犹豫之后，决定留下这笔钱而不声张，但是良心上要受谴责。当问及一生中所作的最好的投资是什么时，有人说是股票，也有人说是房地产。但是，许多男人比较一致的回答是：他们一生所作的最好的投资是找到一个好妻子。
    大多数美国人在买东西时所考虑的，首先是产品的质量。只有百分之十五的读者在买东西时只考虑便宜价格。
    这个调查表明，在找对象时，很少有人考虑对方挣钱多少，这个比例占百分之七十八。他们认为，钱是重要的，但是在找对象时，这个问题对他们并不重要。
