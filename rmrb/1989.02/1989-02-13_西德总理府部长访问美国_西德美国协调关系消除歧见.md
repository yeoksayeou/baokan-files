West German Chancellor's Office Minister Visits the U.S.
West Germany and the U.S. Coordinate Relations to Eliminate Discrepancies

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 11—West German Chancellor's Office Minister Schäuble, who has just concluded his visit to the United States, said that his talks with U.S. President Bush and Secretary of State Baker show that the West German government and the United States have the same views on decisive issues in the field of armaments.

Schäuble made these remarks during an interview with a reporter from the West Berlin *Morgenpost*. The *Morgenpost* will publish this interview tomorrow.

Schäuble said that West Germany and the United States both agree not to make a decision on the replacement of the "Pershing" missiles before 1991. Both sides also agree that "there should not be a third zero option." Both sides have expressed that NATO should formulate a comprehensive plan for security and arms control by the summer of this year.

Schäuble also said that the United States is "extremely satisfied" with West Germany's strengthening of controls on the export of chemical products and other weapons equipment. Schäuble was sent by West German Chancellor Kohl to the United States on February 8 for a three-day visit. Officials here believe that the purpose of Schäuble's visit to the United States was to exchange views with President Bush and Secretary of State Baker on a series of issues, including the "Libyan chemical factory incident," strengthening export controls, NATO security policy, and German-American cooperation, to eliminate discrepancies and coordinate understanding. The two countries had previously had differing views on some issues, especially after the U.S. media criticized West Germany for possibly participating in the construction of the "Libyan chemical factory," which had a noticeable impact on the relationship between the two countries.

　　西德总理府部长访问美国    
    西德美国协调关系消除歧见
    新华社波恩２月１１日电  刚结束对美国访问的西德总理府部长朔伊布勒说，他同美国总统布什和国务卿贝克的会谈表明，在军备领域的决定性问题上，西德政府同美国的看法是一致的。
    朔伊布勒这番话是在他接受西柏林《晨邮报》记者采访时说的。《晨邮报》将于明天发表这一讲话。
    朔伊布勒说，西德和美国都一致同意在１９９１年以前不就取代“长矛”导弹的问题作出决定。双方还一致认为，“不应有第三个零点方案”。双方都表示，北约应在今年初夏制定出安全和军备控制总体方案。
    朔伊布勒还说，美国对西德将强化化工品以及其他武器设备出口的控制表示“极大满意”。朔伊布勒是受西德总理科尔的委托，于２月８日到美国进行为期３天的访问的。这里的人士认为，朔伊布勒美国之行的目的是同布什总统、贝克国务卿就“利比亚化工厂事件”、加强出口控制、北约安全政策和德美合作等一系列问题交换看法，消除歧见，协调认识。德美双方前一段时间在一些问题的看法上调子不尽一致，特别是在美国新闻媒介借西德公司可能参与建造“利比亚化工厂”一事对西德大加指责后，两国关系明显受到影响。
