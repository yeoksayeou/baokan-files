During the Spring Festival, the district chief of Tianjin's Hedong District visited the "family of teachers," the home of Ren Bingjun, and saw that the living quarters were cramped. After discussion, it was decided to award them a two-bedroom apartment. Yesterday, Teacher Ren celebrated his move.

The Ren family, with four generations and 25 members all being teachers, often has students calling out "Teacher Ren" from outside, and everyone inside responds, welcoming them in. Yesterday, more than ten students, ranging from their teens to their sixties, came to help with the move. Ren Bingjun, who is 80 years old and has taught for 50 years, said: "These days, so much joy has come our way. The mayor received us, and the district awarded us a house." He wrote a scroll to give to the district chief: "Respect teachers and value education."

　　政府奖励房一套  教师世家庆乔迁
    本报天津２月２０日电  记者肖荻报道：春节期间，天津市河西区区长去“教师世家”任秉钧家拜年，见住房狭窄，经商定奖以两室一厅住房一套。昨天任老师喜庆乔迁。
    一家４代２５人当教师的任家，常常是学生在外一喊任老师，屋内个个答应，向外迎。昨天有从十几岁到六十几岁的十多个学生来帮忙搬家。８０高龄、曾任教５０载的任秉钧说：这几天多喜临门，市长接见，区里奖房。他挥笔写一横幅赠给区长：尊师重教。
