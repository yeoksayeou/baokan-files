Tianchi Mountain in Wuzhong is renowned for its towering trees, towering rocks that block out the sun, and its tranquil, picturesque scenery, reminiscent of a utopian paradise. The famous Ming Dynasty painter Tang Yin once wrote, "To ascend, one must go to Tianchi Ridge, where the fragrance of osmanthus from a thousand trees floats in the air." The poet Gao Qi also praised it with the lines, "The gate opens to a temple amidst red leaves, and the spring water seeps into the stone pool on the green mountain."

Tianchi Mountain is located in the western part of Suzhou City, within the jurisdiction of Cangshu Township in Wuxian County. It is famous for its three wonders: strange rocks, clear springs, and stone houses. As one ascends the winding mountain path, one sees the rugged and varied rocks along the way. There are rocks that cleverly combine to form "Shoustar Reading Scriptures," and rocks that peek out of the water like shy, bashful girls, known as "Xiaoniang Stone." The "Lianhua Peak" standing on the mountain top is composed of several rocks tens of feet high, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, precariously balanced like stacked eggs. It is said to be man-made but is actually natural. From afar, it resembles a lotus flower emerging from the water, earning it the title of "First Peak of Wuzhong." The mountain is filled with springs, including Beimo Spring, Hupao Spring, Yingying Spring, Dilie Spring, Xixin Spring, and Hanku Spring. The "Peach Blossom Gorge" flowing down the mountain slope is a perpetual spring, with water gurgling year-round. The Tianchi, formed by the convergence of mountain springs, "spans tens of feet and moistens the mountain's belly." The blue sky and white clouds are reflected in the pool, appearing like smoke and mist, ethereal and mysterious, known as "Watery Smoke and Clouds."

Near Tianchi, there are three stone houses at Jijian Temple, all built during the Yuan Dynasty from the 17th to the 23rd year of the Zhiyuan reign. These houses mimic wooden structures and have high historical and artistic value. Two of them are in the style of Buddhist niches, each containing a Buddha statue carved from a single piece of mountain rock; the other is in the style of a hall, known as "Xitian Temple," with six coffered ceilings on the roof, varying in size and form, and intricately carved.

According to the records of "Tianchi Jijian Chan Temple," this place was originally the private residence of Zhang Yu, the Governor of Kuaiji during the Liu Song Dynasty of the Six Dynasties period. During the Qian Dao reign of the Southern Song Dynasty, it became the villa of Zhang Tingjie, the Secretary of the Imperial Library. In the 17th year of the Zhizheng reign of the Yuan Dynasty, the Jijian Chan Temple was established here.

　　吴中天池有“三绝”
　　江宗荣
    吴中天池山，长林参天，苍岩蔽日，景色幽雅，宛如桃源。明代著名画家唐寅有诗曰：“登高须向天池岭，桂花千树天香浮。”诗人高启也有赞句：“门开红叶林间寺，泉浸青山石上池。”
    天池山坐落在苏州城西吴县藏书乡境内，以怪石、清泉、石屋“三绝”著称。沿着蜿蜒曲折的山道拾级而上，但见道旁山石嶙峋，形态各异，有以两石巧妙配合构成的“寿星读经”，有在水中探头探脑、神若羞羞怯怯少女般的“小娘石”。而那屹立于山巅的“莲花峰”，由几块数丈高的岩石组成，上宽下窄，危如累卵，疑为人凿，实为天然，远望似亭亭玉立的出水芙蓉，有“吴中第一峰”之誉。山中泉眼比比皆是，有钵盂泉、虎跑泉、盈盈泉、地雷泉、洗心泉、寒枯泉等。顺山坡奔流而下的“桃花涧”，泉水淙淙，终年不竭。由山泉汇蓄而成的天池，“横亘十数丈，润浸山腹”，蓝天白云倒映于池中，似烟如雾，缥渺神奇，谓之“水底烟云”。天池附近的寂鉴寺，有石屋三座，均建于元代至元十七年至二十三年，系仿木结构，有很高的历史和艺术价值。其中两座为佛龛式，屋内各有佛像一尊，以整块山岩刻凿而成；另一座为殿堂式，称“西天寺”，顶部有六个藻井，大小不一，形式不同，雕刻生动。
    据《天池寂鉴禅庵》记载，这里原为六朝刘宋时会稽太守张裕的私第，南宋乾道年间又为秘书监张廷杰的别墅，至元代至正十七年时在此创建寂鉴禅庵。
