South Korea: The "Kingdom" of Traffic Accidents

	Our reporter Xu Baokang reports from Pyongyang, February 13: In the five days before and after the Spring Festival, South Korea created a new world record for traffic accidents, with 2,250 car crashes resulting in 3,000 injuries and deaths.

	Traffic accidents in South Korea are rampant and have become a serious social issue. According to reports, last year alone, 10,294 people died in traffic accidents. Since 1978, the number of people killed in traffic accidents has reached 65,374, which is 16 times higher than in the United States, Britain, and Japan, making it infamous as the "Kingdom" of traffic accidents. The root cause of the surge in traffic accidents in South Korea is the chaotic management by the authorities, drivers' disregard for traffic rules, and drunk driving.

	The South Korean Broadcasting Corporation commented, "This means that while there are cars, there is fundamentally no car culture."

　　南朝鲜：交通事故“王国”
    本报平壤２月１３日电  记者徐宝康报道：南朝鲜春节前后５天内，创造世界交通事故新纪录，发生车祸２２５０起，死伤人数达３０００人。
    南朝鲜交通事故层出不穷，已成为严重的社会问题。据报道，仅去年因车祸就死亡１０２９４人。１９７８年以来，交通事故死亡人数达６５３７４人，是美国、英国、日本交通事故的１６倍，成为有名的交通事故“王国”。南朝鲜交通事故剧增，其根本原因是当局管理混乱，司机无视交通规则，酒后开车等造成的。
    南朝鲜文化广播评论说，“这意味着有了汽车，但根本没有汽车文化”。
