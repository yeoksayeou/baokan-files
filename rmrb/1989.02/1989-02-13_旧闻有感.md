Title: Reflections on Old News

I have been a journalist for over ten years. I recently read an article in *New Observer* about how, on December 12th of the previous year, just after taking office, Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru received two young reporters from the *Asahi Shogakusei Shinbun* at his private residence in Tokyo's Daizawa. The visitors were a ten-year-old boy from Yokohama's private Seikei Elementary School and a ten-year-old girl from Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward's public Komiyama Minami Elementary School. This interview was for a New Year's special issue. The topics covered were quite trivial. Questions like: "Prime Minister, you loved reading as a child. Did you enjoy Tetsu Yano's *Nora Inu*?" "I admire Mozart very much. What about you, Prime Minister?" "I was often teased in elementary school. Was it the same for you, Prime Minister?" Takeshita Noboru answered them all. When the topic turned to judo, he even showed off a bit: "You know, I'm a fifth-degree black belt!" He stood up and demonstrated a few moves, even rolling on the ground, completely without the demeanor of a prime minister. This incident made me, as a journalist, think about how difficult it is to gain access to certain places.

　　旧闻有感
    我作记者，十年有余矣。偶读《新观察》载文：前年十二月十二日，日本首相竹下登刚上台，就在东京代泽的私邸接待了《朝日小学生新闻》两位小记者的采访。来访者是横滨市私立成蹊小学的十岁男童和东京都叮田市市立小山田南小学的十岁女童。这次采访是为了出新年号特刊。内容尽是一些鸡零狗碎的话题。诸如：“总理，你幼年爱看书，不知是否喜欢田河水泡的《田野黑狗》？”“我很崇拜莫扎特，总理呢？”“我因为在小学常受戏弄，总理小时候也同样吗？”竹下登一一作答。谈及柔道时，此公竟露出得意之色：“你们知道吗？伯伯还是五段呢！”言毕竟起身拉了几个架势，还在地上打了一个滚，全然没有一点首相的架子。此事不由我这个从业于新闻的人想到一些门难进的状态。
