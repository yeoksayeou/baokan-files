The Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission recently reported to the entire military the handling of economic cases and issues involving the military that were exposed in news reports. The report emphasized the importance of correctly handling public opinion supervision, strengthening the education of relevant responsible cadres and personnel, and raising their awareness of discipline and law.

The report stated that since last October, several central news organizations have successively exposed 12 issues involving military units violating policies and regulations and engaging in illegal buying and selling. After these issues were exposed, the relevant units' party committees and discipline inspection commissions paid great attention and quickly organized forces to conduct thorough investigations.

The report listed the main economic cases and issues that have been handled:

On October 5 last year, the *People's Daily* reported on issues involving the military in vehicles seized by the Hunan Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce for illegal crossing. The Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission sent personnel to participate in a joint investigation team led by the State Supervision Department, investigated the issues exposed in the report, and handled them seriously according to relevant regulations. Some vehicles were confiscated, some were fined, and some personnel were held accountable.

On October 17 last year, the *People's Daily* exposed the issue of the Chengdu Veterans' Home of the General Staff Department selling fake "Wuliangye" and fake "Luzhou Laojiao" liquor. The relevant higher-level party committees and discipline inspection commissions quickly investigated the facts. The two main leaders of the Veterans' Home were given party disciplinary actions of demotion and administrative warnings, and the issue was reported to subordinate units.

On September 11 last year, a deputy director of the logistics department of a certain regiment in the Guangxi Military Region was caught by customs while transporting cigarettes for local speculators to Zhejiang. He was fined 3,000 yuan. On October 25, Central Television exposed this issue. After the Guangxi Military Region and the regiment's discipline inspection commission investigated the issue, the deputy director was given a serious party warning.

At the end of August last year, the logistics department of a certain unit in the Air Force purchased 15 sets of old car parts from the Dongguan Labor Industry Company in Guangdong, transported them to the Yinxian Material Reserve in Henan, and planned to assemble them for military use. The *People's Daily* reported on this. With the cooperation of local industrial and commercial management departments, the Air Force promptly sent personnel to investigate the issue, imposed a fine of 100,000 yuan, and decided to seal the stored complete car parts. The Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission has instructed the Air Force's Discipline Inspection Commission to investigate the responsibility of relevant personnel.

After the issue of the 210th Hospital of the Shenyang Military Region selling lamps and tables from the hospital's service society to inpatients under public funds was exposed on Central Television, the Shenyang Military Region's Discipline Inspection Commission immediately instructed the relevant units to handle the issue. Three responsible persons were given administrative serious warnings or administrative warnings.

The report pointed out that the Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission requires all military units to seriously implement the central government's policies on rectifying the economic environment, regulating economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. It emphasizes the importance of having a strong policy concept, legal concept, and overall concept, strictly enforcing the policies and regulations of the party, state, and military, and not engaging in illegal buying and selling, illegal assembly of vehicles, or renting and lending military vehicle plates. It also emphasizes not using military vehicles, ships, or aircraft for illegal transportation. All levels of party committees and discipline inspection commissions must pay high attention to major economic cases and issues in their units, strengthen investigation and handling work, and thoroughly investigate and handle each case discovered. For economic cases involving both military and civilian sectors, the military must actively investigate and handle internal problems and must not protect their own.

　　军委纪委重视舆论批评  查处经济案件决不护短
    本报揭露的三起案件均已查实处理
    据新华社北京２月２７日电  中央军委纪委日前向全军通报了新闻报道中涉及部队的经济案件和问题查处的情况，要求各单位正确对待舆论监督，加强对有关负责干部和工作人员的教育，提高遵纪守法的自觉性。
    中央军委纪委的通报说，去年１０月以来，中央一些新闻单位先后披露涉及部队一些单位违反政策规定、倒买倒卖问题１２件。这些问题披露后，有关单位的党委、纪委都比较重视，很快组织力量认真进行核查。
    通报列举了已经查处的主要经济案件和问题：
    去年１０月５日，《人民日报》报道了湖南省工商管理部门查扣违章过境汽车中涉及军队的问题。军委纪委派人参加国家监察部牵头的联合调查组，查清了报道揭露的问题，并按有关规定作了严肃处理。有的汽车被没收，有的被处以罚款，有的追究了有关人员的责任。
    去年１０月１７日，《人民日报》披露总参某部成都干休所推销假“五粮液”和假“泸州特曲”酒的问题后，有关上级党委、纪委，迅速查清了事实。分别给予干休所两名主要领导干部撤销党内职务、行政警告处分，并通报所属单位。
    去年９月１１日，广西军区某团后勤处副处长带车前往广州采购，途中为地方投机倒把分子往浙江运香烟被缉私站查获，罚款３０００元。１０月２５日，中央电视台披露了这一问题。广西军区和某师纪委查清问题后，给这名副处长党内严重警告处分。
    去年８月底，空军后勤某部从广东东莞市劳动实业公司购进日产“皇冠”、“蓝鸟”等旧车散件１５套，运到河南汲县物资库，准备组装供部队自用。对此，《人民日报》作了报道。空军在地方工商管理部门的配合下，及时派人查清了问题，依法处以罚款１万元，决定查封存放的成套汽车散件。军委纪委已责成空军纪委追究有关人员的责任。
    沈阳军区２１０医院假借医疗用品名义，向公费住院患者出售该院服务社滞销的台灯和茶几的问题，在中央电视台公诸于众后，沈阳军区纪委即责成有关单位作了查处，对三名有关责任者给予行政严重警告或行政警告处分。
    通报指出，军委纪委要求各部队认真贯彻中央关于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，树立坚强的政策观念、法纪观念和全局观念，严格执行党和国家的政策法令及军队的有关规定，不准违反规定买、卖进口汽车，不准非法拼装汽车，不准进行倒买倒卖活动，不准出租、出借军车牌号，不准用军用车、船、飞机搞非法运输。各级党委、纪委对本单位发生的重大经济案件和问题，务必高度重视，加强查办工作，做到发现一件，认真查办一件。对于军地互涉的经济案件，要主动查处部队内部的问题，决不能护短。
