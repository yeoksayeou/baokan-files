The party committee of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region has resisted unhealthy tendencies in camp construction. In recent years, this unit has undertaken the task of demolishing the dilapidated buildings from before liberation and rebuilding 38,000 square meters of camp facilities. The tens of millions of yuan in construction funds have attracted construction teams from all directions, all vying to take on the project. To ensure the quality of the project, the unit's party committee has formulated a clean governance agreement: it is forbidden to hire construction teams through the personal channels of officers and soldiers to employ relatives and acquaintances from their hometowns; a bidding process will be implemented for the contracting teams, and their technical capabilities, machinery, and financial resources will be investigated and verified; the hiring of construction teams cannot be decided by individuals, but must be decided through party committee discussions; it is strictly forbidden to accept gifts from the contracting teams, and if discovered, disciplinary and legal actions will be taken.

Recently, financial inspection personnel from the Shenyang Military Region have conducted multiple inspections of this unit's construction accounts, and among the more than 70,000 delivery tickets, not a single one violated financial regulations.

　　沈阳军区某团在营建中抵制歪风
    本报讯  沈阳军区某团党委在营建中抵制不正之风。近年，这个团接受了推翻解放前的危房，重建３．８万平方米营房的任务。上千万元的营建费用，吸引了八方建筑队，纷纷要求承包工程。为了确保工程质量，团党委制订了廉洁公约：不准通过干部战士私人途径招用家乡亲属熟人的施工队；对承包队实行招标，对其技术、机器、财力进行调查考证；招用施工队不能个人说了算，必须经党委研究决定；一律不许接收承包队礼物，一经查出给予纪律和法律制裁。
    最近，沈阳军区财务检查人员几次检查这个团营建帐，７万多张发货票，无一违反财经制度。
