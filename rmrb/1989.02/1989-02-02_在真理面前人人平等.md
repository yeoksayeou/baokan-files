Title: Everyone is Equal Before the Truth

Recently, a newspaper in Shanghai published a lengthy article by Wang Li discussing the "Cultural Revolution" over a full page, seemingly without any interference. I wonder if this is a signal that the "Cultural Revolution" is no longer a restricted topic for research.

The events of the "Cultural Revolution" are indeed very complex. At the end of Wang Li's Q&A, he stated that he is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and therefore has the right to publicly clarify the facts. This statement is not incorrect. However, what are the "facts" that he has revealed? It turns out that Wang Li seems to be a victim of the "Cultural Revolution" rather than a culprit (or at least a collaborator), that Wang Li and Kang Sheng are not allies but that Kang Sheng is his persecutor, that the term "Wang, Guan, Qi" is a "scientific and erroneous proposition" created by Jiang Qing, and that Wang Li's "thought level far surpasses that of Qu Yuan and Jia Yi" ... Is this the truth?

Of course, Wang Li's Q&A also has its advantages. It allows readers to understand Wang Li's current situation and thoughts. For example, his living conditions are better than those of many old cadres. "A beautiful small car," "his demeanor is still very elegant," "his home is bright and spacious," "with red carpets" ... These are not only things that ordinary cadres cannot enjoy, but even a high-ranking cadre like a former vice-director of the Propaganda Department of the South China Bureau in the early days of liberation, who was a vice-director of the People's Publishing House in 1957, cannot compare. Again, not only Wang Li, but also the author of the article, Comrade Ye Yonglie, is also advocating for Wang Li.

Someone once criticized Ba Jin in a Tianjin magazine, saying that Old Ba should not keep talking about the "Cultural Revolution" in his "Random Thoughts," but should talk about more realistic issues of right and wrong. Wang Li's speech proves that the "Cultural Revolution" is not an outdated topic.

The question is, since Wang Li and other "big shots" of the "Cultural Revolution" can talk about the "Cultural Revolution," then other people also have the right as citizens to talk about the "Cultural Revolution." If everyone is equal before the truth, that would be a good thing.

However, it seems that it is not possible. When talking about the issue of Dong Jianying's wrongful death and his argument with Dong Bian, Wang Li said: "The situation I know, Comrade Dong Bian may not know." In another place, he said: "Wang Li's problem involves some state secrets that have not been disclosed." This is equivalent to saying, since you do not know the situation, since you do not know the secrets, you, Comrade Dong Bian, had better step aside and mind your own business. I know the secrets, so let me comment on the "Cultural Revolution" and myself. Since even Dong Jianying's wife, Dong Bian, does not have the right to speak, how much less do we ordinary people! This is no surprise. Wang Li was one of the drafters of the "May 16th Notice," which criticized the principle of "everyone is equal before the truth"! At that time, there was no such thing as political transparency!

However, I still stubbornly insist on the principle of "everyone is equal before the truth." I am not advocating that everyone should dig up old accounts, but if Wang Li can talk about the "Cultural Revolution," then the thousands and millions of people who were persecuted in various forms and with different consequences during the "Cultural Revolution" have even more right to talk about the "Cultural Revolution." To use "secrets" to fire a blank shot and silence others, in a time when the Central Committee has made a decision to comprehensively negate the "Cultural Revolution," is this not a strange thing!

　　在真理面前人人平等
    牧惠
    最近，上海一家报纸用一大版的篇幅发表了王力答客问谈“文革”的宏文，似乎并没有遭到谁的干涉。不知这是不是“文革”不再是研究禁区的一个信号。
    “文革”的事情，确实很复杂。王力在答客问的结束中说，他是中华人民共和国公民，所以有权公开澄清事实。这句话不可谓错。可是，他所揭示的“事实真相”是什么呢？原来，似乎王力是“文革”的受害者而不是罪人（最少也应当是帮凶一类吧），王力同康生不是一伙而是康生的迫害对象，“王、关、戚”这个词是江青制造出来的“不科学、并且是错误的提法”，王力“思想境界远远超出屈原、贾谊之上”……这是事实吗？
    当然，王力的答客问也有一个好处，它让读者了解王力当今的处境和思想，例如，他的生活条件比许多老干部要好。“一辆漂亮的小轿车”，“风度仍十分潇洒”，“他的家明亮、宽敞”，“铺着红地毯”……这些，不仅是一般干部享受不到，就连像一位解放初期任华南分局宣传部副部长、１９５７年被“扩大”时任人民出版社副社长的八级高干也望尘莫及呀。又如，不仅王力，而且文章的作者叶永烈同志也为王力鸣冤叫屈。
    有人曾在天津一家杂志批评巴金，说巴老不该在《随想录》中没完没了地谈“文革”，应当谈一些更现实的是非问题。王力的发言证明，“文革”并不是一个过时的话题。
    问题是，既然王力等“文革”中的“猛人”都可以谈“文革”，那么，其他人也拥有公民权，更应当有权谈“文革”。如果真理面前人人平等，倒是件好事。
    然而，看来又不行。王力在谈到有关田家英含冤去世董边同他争论的问题时说：“我所了解的情况，董边同志不一定了解。”在另外一个地方又说：“王力的问题有一部分涉及到国家没有公布的机密”。这等于说，由于你们不了解情况，你们不了解机密，你董边最好还是靠边，少插嘴。我才了解机密，让我来评论“文革”和自己才合适。既然连田家英夫人董边都没有发言权，又何况我等平头百姓呢！这也难怪。批判“在真理面前人人平等”的《五·一六通知》，王力是起草人之一嘛！那时哪有什么政治透明度可言呢！
    我却仍然极不知趣地顽固坚持“在真理面前人人平等”这个原则。我并不是主张大家都来翻腾旧账，但是，如果王力可以谈“文革”，千千万万在“文革”中遭到形式不一、后果各异的被迫害者，就更有权谈“文革”。用什么“机密”来虚恍一枪堵别人的嘴，在中央已经作出决议、全面否定“文革”之后的今天，岂非咄咄怪事！
