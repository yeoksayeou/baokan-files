The Central Nationalities Orchestra has recently begun implementing a system where the artistic director is in charge, with composer Liu Wengin appointed as the artistic director and composer Yang Dacheng as the general manager, following approval by the Ministry of Culture.

The Central Nationalities Orchestra was established in 1960 and is currently the largest comprehensive national music performance troupe in both China and Asia. The orchestra has a full complement of over 100 musicians forming a large national orchestra and the only choir in the country specializing in performing Chinese classical and folk choral works. It also has a group of renowned lyricists, composers, conductors, and over 200 staff members.

Artistic Director Liu Wengin stated that during his three-year term, he will establish a management system centered on artistic production, with administrative management as a supporting role, to replace the previous bureaucratic management style. During the artistic production process, a competitive mechanism will be introduced, and a contract system will be implemented to change the old remuneration methods, conducting regular business assessments and performance evaluations. He will also work with the entire team and various sectors to reform the national music itself, including the orchestra's instruments, combinations, arrangements, and other aspects, using more scientific methods to develop national music. However, Liu Wengin also believes that since the overall environment for cultural system reform is not yet fully mature, they can only do their best under the current conditions, and people should not have high expectations.

　　中央民族乐团新体制形成
    作曲家刘文金出任艺术总监
    本报讯  记者陈原报道：最近，经文化部批准，中央民族乐团开始实行艺术总监负责制，《长城随想曲》作者、作曲家刘文金出任艺术总监，作曲家杨大成执掌总经理之职。
    中央民族乐团创立于１９６０年，是目前我国和亚洲规模最大的综合性民族音乐艺术表演团体。乐团拥有百名乐手组成的编制完备的大型民族管弦乐队和全国唯一的专门演唱中国古典和民族民间合唱作品的合唱队，还有一批知名的词曲作家、指挥家，演职人员共２００多人。
    刘文金总监表示，在他任职的三年内，将建立一套以艺术生产管理为中心、行政管理为辅线的机制，以取代过去衙门化的管理方式。在艺术生产过程中，将引入竞争机制，实行聘任制，改变旧的酬劳方法，进行定期的业务考核和劳绩考察。他还将和全团一起，联合各界力量，着手对民乐自身，包括乐队的乐器、组合、排列等加以改革，用更为科学的方法来发展民乐。但刘文金也认为，由于文艺体制改革的大环境尚未完全成熟，故他们只能在现有的条件下尽力为之，人们不必存有奢望。
