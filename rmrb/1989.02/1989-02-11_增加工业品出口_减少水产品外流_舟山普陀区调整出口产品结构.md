	Increasing industrial exports and reducing the outflow of aquatic products, Putuo District in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, has adjusted its export product structure. According to statistics, last year the district's aquatic product exports decreased by 38.5% compared to the previous year. In contrast, exports of industrial products such as clothing and toys increased by 16.4%.

	Putuo District, primarily known for its fishing industry, has a weak foundation in both industry and township enterprises. In the past few years, the district's foreign exchange earnings mainly relied on aquatic products, leading to the outflow of some domestically scarce resources. In recent years, the district has accelerated the construction of basic facilities such as island transportation, electricity, and communications, creating conditions for further developing industrial and township enterprise products for export. At the beginning of last year, the district government issued a special document encouraging enterprises to develop new export products and providing six types of preferential treatments, including funds, materials, electricity, coal, and diesel, to enterprises that earn foreign exchange through exports. Relevant departments in the district also actively support the export of industrial products, helping to establish connections, transmit information, and solve financial difficulties.

	In early July last year, the district's foreign trade company learned that a Hong Kong businessman dealing in toys was in Ningbo. They immediately went to invite the businessman to visit a township enterprise in the district that produces electric pandas. After carefully inspecting the factory's equipment, personnel, production capacity, and product quality, the businessman placed an order on the spot. In the second half of the year, the factory exported over 20,000 various electric panda toys, valued at over 260,000 yuan.

　　增加工业品出口　减少水产品外流    
    舟山普陀区调整出口产品结构
    本报讯  浙江舟山市普陀区针对近年水产资源下降、水产品出口不合算等实际情况，调整出口创汇产品结构。据统计，去年全区出口水产品比上年下降３８．５％；出口服装、玩具等工业品则比上年增长了１６．４％。
    普陀区以渔为主，工业和乡镇企业基础薄弱。前几年该区出口创汇主要依靠水产品，使部分国内市场紧缺的资源外流。近几年，区里加紧海岛交通、电力、通讯等基础设施建设，为进一步开发工业、乡镇企业产品出口创造了条件。去年初，区政府专门发文鼓励企业开发新产品出口，并对出口创汇企业在资金、材料、供电、煤、柴油等６个方面给予优惠。区有关部门也努力支持工业产品出口，帮助牵线搭桥、传递信息，解决资金不足等困难。
    去年７月上旬，区外贸公司得知一位经营玩具的香港客商在宁波，就立即赶去把港商请到本区一家生产电动熊猫的乡镇企业参观。那位客商仔细查看了工厂的设备、人员、生产能力及产品质量后，当场要求进货。下半年，该厂就出口各类电动熊猫玩具２万余件，价值２６万余元。
