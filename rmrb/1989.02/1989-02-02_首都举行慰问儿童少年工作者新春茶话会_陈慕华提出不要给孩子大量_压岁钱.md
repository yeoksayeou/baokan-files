More than 150 youth workers from the capital gathered at the China Children and Youth Activity Center today to attend a spring tea party hosted by the National Coordinating Committee for Children and Youth Work and the All-China Women's Federation. Song Renqing, Kang Keqing, and Chen Muxia were present.

Chen Muxia, chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the event and suggested that parents and relatives should not give children large amounts of "lucky money" during the Spring Festival. She emphasized that this practice should not be allowed to cultivate bad habits of extravagance and waste in children. Instead, she proposed giving children small gifts such as toys and books. She also expressed her hope that relevant departments would provide children with abundant material and spiritual nourishment for their healthy growth.

    全国妇联主席陈慕华在讲话中提出：家长和亲友在春节期间不要给孩子大量的“压岁钱”，不能使他们养成奢侈浪费的坏习气，可给孩子送点玩具、书籍等小礼物。她希望各有关部门能为儿童的健康成长提供丰富的物质和精神食粮。
