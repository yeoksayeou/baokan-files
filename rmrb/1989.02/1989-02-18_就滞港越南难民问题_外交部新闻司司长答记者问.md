The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Answers Questions from Reporters

New China News Agency, Beijing, February 17 - Today, a reporter from New China News Agency interviewed Li Zhaoxing, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the issue of Vietnamese refugees stranded in Hong Kong. Li Zhaoxing said: "According to reports from Hong Kong newspapers, the Vietnamese government recently sent officials to Hong Kong to screen the Vietnamese boat people stranded there. The result was that only a small number were willing to be repatriated. We are concerned about this."

He said, "The consistent position of the Chinese government is that the British government has the responsibility to take effective measures to resolve the issue of Vietnamese refugees stranded in Hong Kong before 1997. If this issue cannot be promptly and properly resolved, it will affect the smooth transition in 1997 and will impose an unnecessary burden on the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government."

Li Zhaoxing pointed out, "According to the relevant provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Vietnamese refugees and boat people stranded in Hong Kong, as well as their children born in Hong Kong, should not have the right of residence in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has already expressed this position to the British government through diplomatic channels and will continue to negotiate with the British government on this issue through appropriate channels."

　　就滞港越南难民问题
    外交部新闻司司长答记者问
    新华社北京２月１７日电  新华社记者今天就滞留在香港的越南难民问题采访了外交部新闻司司长李肇星。李肇星说：“据香港报纸报道，最近越南政府派人去香港，对滞港越南船民进行了审核，结果只有少数人愿意被遣返。我们对此表示担忧。”
    他说，中国政府的一贯立场是：英国政府有责任采取有效措施在１９９７年前解决滞留在香港的越南难民问题。如果这一问题不能及时得到合理解决，势将影响到１９９７年的顺利过渡，并会给未来的香港特别行政区政府带来不应有的负担。
    李肇星指出，“根据中英联合声明的有关规定，滞港越南难民和船民及其在港所生子女不应享有香港的居留权。中国政府早已通过外交途径向英国政府表明这一立场，并将继续通过适当途径就此问题同英国政府商谈。”
