Japanese prosecutors have arrested the main suspect in the "Riku" case. The former chairman of the Rikuruto Company, Etsuo Egawa, was arrested this afternoon by the Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of bribery. It is believed that this will have a significant impact on Japan's political landscape.

According to reports, this morning, officials from the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, Tokyo High Prosecutor's Office, Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office, and the Ministry of Justice held a joint meeting and concluded that Egawa's transfer of unlisted stocks constitutes a bribery act.

Arrested at the same time as Egawa were Shiba Eiichi and Toshihiko Nagawagaya, both directors of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company. Prosecutors suspect that the two provided business favors to Rikuruto Company in exchange for a large number of its unlisted stocks.

A former office manager of a subsidiary of Rikuruto Company, Hiroshi Matsubara, was arrested and indicted last November for bribing a Diet member.

Local opinion holds that the arrest of Egawa and others marks a breakthrough in the prosecutors' investigation into the "Riku" case. The prosecutors' next target is expected to be Fumio Takashi, the vice-minister of the Ministry of Education, and Takashi Kato, the vice-minister of the Ministry of Labor. Both government officials are suspected of having received certain benefits from Rikuruto Company in exchange for unlisted stocks.

　　日本检察当局逮捕“利案”主犯
    新华社东京２月１３日电（记者张可喜）利库路特公司前董事长江副浩正因有行贿嫌疑今天下午被东京地方检察院逮捕。据认为日本政局将因此而深受影响。
    据报道，今天上午，最高检察院、东京高等检察院、东京地方检察院和法务省等方面的官员联合举行会议，作出了江副浩正转让未公开股票属于一种行贿行为的结论。
    与江副浩正同时被捕的，还有日本电信电话公司董事式场英和长川谷寿彦。检察当局怀疑他们两人向利库路特公司提供业务方便，获得了大量该公司未公开发行的股票。
    利库路特公司的一家分公司的前总经理办公室主任——松原弘向国会议员行贿，已于去年１１月被捕和被起诉。
    此间舆论认为，江副浩正等人的被捕，使检察当局对“利”案的调查有了突破性进展，检察当局的矛头今后将指向文部省事务次官高石邦男和劳动省事务次官加藤孝元。因为这两名政府要员也都涉嫌给利库路特公司以某种好处而获得该公司未公开股票。
