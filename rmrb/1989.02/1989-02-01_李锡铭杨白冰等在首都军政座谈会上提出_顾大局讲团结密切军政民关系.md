Today in the afternoon, Beijing City and the General Staff, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, along with 14 other military units stationed in Beijing, held a military-political forum in the Beijing Hall of the Great Hall of the People.

The military and political leaders attending the forum, in a very harmonious atmosphere, discussed the deep bond between the military units stationed in Beijing and the local community since the reform and opening up. In 1988, the military units stationed in Beijing supported the construction of the Asian Games and assisted in local production, contributing 320,000 labor days. They also volunteered to plant 110,000 trees to green and beautify the capital. To share the financial and material burdens of the local government, many regiments, battalions, and companies established small vegetable gardens, pig farms, chicken coops, and fish ponds. The armored troops stationed in Changping County helped impoverished mountain villagers achieve prosperity through science and technology, receiving praise from the local people. Last year, Beijing City extensively carried out production and savings activities, ensuring the living supplies for the military units, institutions, and soldiers stationed in Beijing. The city settled all demobilized and transferred soldiers within 7 days, setting an example for the whole country. The city's leaders at all levels paid great attention to occasional friction in military-civilian relations, resolving them promptly and appropriately.

Li Ximing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, proposed at the meeting that in the new situation of reform and opening up, both the military and local authorities, especially the local authorities, should consider the big picture and promote unity to improve military-political and military-civilian relations. Yang Baibing, member of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department, said: The General Political Department is studying the issue of how the military should do local work in the relatively long period of peace ahead. Reform and opening up, developing a commodity economy, the military's work with the masses should do more practical things and support local economic construction. Currently, we should strictly manage the military, strengthen organizational discipline, observe local regulations, consider the big picture, overcome difficulties, and share the burdens of the country, the people, and the party.

Mayor Chen Xitong interjected: Some units or individuals in the local area extort money from the People's Liberation Army, and even disrespect the military. The local authorities should handle these issues.

　　李锡铭杨白冰等在首都军政座谈会上提出
　  顾大局讲团结密切军政民关系
    本报北京１月３１日讯  记者张书政报道：今日下午，北京市和解放军总参、总政、总后三总部等１４家驻京部队单位在人民大会堂北京厅举行首都军政座谈会。
    与会的军政领导在十分和睦的气氛中，畅叙了改革开放以来驻京部队与地方上的鱼水情谊。１９８８年，驻京部队支援亚运会工程建设和助民生产３２万个劳动日，为绿化美化首都义务植树１１万棵。为分担地方财力和物资供给方面的困难，许多团、营、连建起了小菜园、养猪场、养鸡场、养鱼池；驻昌平县装甲兵某部帮助贫困山区农民科技致富，受到群众赞扬。北京市去年广泛开展增产节约活动，保障了驻京部队、机关和指战员的生活供给。该市去年在７天内就把一批复员转业军人全部安置好，在全国起了示范作用。北京市各级领导十分重视军民关系中偶尔出现的一些磨擦问题，及时、妥善地予以解决。
    中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭在会上提出，在改革开放的新形势下，军地双方，特别是地方，要顾大局、讲团结，改善军政军民关系。中央军委委员、总政治部主任杨白冰上将说：总政治部正在研究今后相当长的和平时期里，部队如何作好地方群众工作问题。改革开放，发展商品经济，部队的群众工作应多做实事，支援地方经济建设。当前，应从严治军，加强组织纪律性，遵守地方各项法规，顾全大局，克服困难，为国、为民、为党分忧。
    北京市长陈希同插话说：地方上有的单位或个人向解放军敲竹杠，甚至发生比较严重的不尊重解放军的事情，地方上应处理。
