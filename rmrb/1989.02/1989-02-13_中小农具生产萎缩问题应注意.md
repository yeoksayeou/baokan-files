Recently, Zhang Chaoming, manager of the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Tools Company, told reporters that in the 1970s, every county in Zhejiang Province had agricultural tool factories, with a total exceeding 5,000. However, now there are only 2,000 left.

According to statistics from the provincial supply and marketing cooperatives, from 1978 to 1987, the supply and inventory of small and medium-sized agricultural tools decreased by about 60%. Now, in many places, farmers find it difficult to buy agricultural tools, and the supply-demand contradiction is very prominent.

However, some managers of small and medium-sized agricultural tool production enterprises told reporters that if it were not for the higher authorities treating the production of agricultural tools as a political task and imposing it on them, they would have long since shed this burden. The profit rate is less than 3%. In 1985, Zhejiang Province supplied nearly 30,000 tons of planned steel to the production of small and medium-sized agricultural tools, but in 1988, it dropped to 9,500 tons.

　　中小农具生产萎缩问题应注意
    最近，浙江省农具公司经理张朝明告诉记者，７０年代，浙江省乡乡都有农具厂，总数超过５０００家，可目前仅剩下２０００家了。
    据省供销社统计，从１９７８年到１９８７年的十年间，中小农具的供应量和库存量下降６０％左右。现在是许多地方农民买农具难，供需矛盾很突出。
    然而，一些中小农具生产企业的厂长经理对记者说，如果不是上边把生产农具当政治任务压我们，他们早把这包袱甩了，利润率还不到３％。１９８５年浙江省供应给生产中小农具的计划内钢材有近３万吨，１９８８年却下降到９５００吨。
