According to a meeting on sugar production from sugar beets and sugarcane, the sugarcane sugar production for this sugar-making period is expected to reach 3.77 million tons, and sugar beet production is expected to exceed 1 million tons. Therefore, the total sugar production for this sugar-making period is expected to be 4.8 million tons, an increase of 470,000 tons compared to the previous period.

It is understood that although sugar production has not yet returned to its historical peak, it can meet the market demand for sugar under the current urban and rural supply standards.

Currently, China's food industry and other industrial sectors face a significant shortage of sugar. The reason why the increase in sugar production, albeit substantial, still cannot meet the demand is that there is considerable waste in the industrial use of sugar. This is mainly due to the unreasonable price ratio between sugar and other commodities, leading many dairy factories to use sugar beyond the standard. To address the sugar shortage, in addition to increasing production, it is also necessary to boost the enthusiasm of sugar farmers to plant sugar crops. It is reported that sugar-producing regions have adjusted the prices of sugar crops and formulated preferential policies to encourage sugar cultivation.

### 食糖增产有望  工业用糖缺口仍较大

　　食糖增产有望
    工业用糖缺口仍较大
    本报讯  据甜菜和甘蔗糖生产会议预计，本制糖期甘蔗糖产量可达３７７万吨，甜菜制糖产量突破１００万吨，这样，本制糖期食糖产量预计有４８０万吨，比上个制糖期增产４７万吨。
    据了解，食糖产量虽还没有恢复到历史最高水平，但按目前城乡居民供应标准，满足市场食糖需要没有问题。
    目前我国食品工业和其他工业用糖缺口较大。食糖生产虽有大幅度增加仍然不能满足需要的原因，是工业用糖的浪费较大，这主要是食糖与其他商品的比价不合理，造成很多乳品厂超过标准使用糖料，解决食糖紧缺，除努力增产外，还应提高糖农种植糖料的积极性。据悉，产糖地区已调整糖料价格，并制定优惠政策以鼓励种糖料。
