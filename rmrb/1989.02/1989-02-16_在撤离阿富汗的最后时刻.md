In the final moments of withdrawal from Afghanistan

New China News Agency reporter Wang Xianhu

Today at noon, dozens of military vehicles carrying over 300 Soviet reconnaissance soldiers, with their headlights on and horns blaring, rumbled across the Amu Darya Bridge at the border between the Soviet Union's southwestern Uzbeki Republic and Afghanistan, returning to the Soviet border town of Termez.

At 9:55 Moscow time (noon local time), the last armored vehicle stopped just short of the bridgehead. Soviet Commander in Afghanistan, General Gromov, jumped down from the vehicle. His 14-year-old son ran up and tightly embraced his father. A group of reporters rushed forward, and the 45-year-old Gromov told them, "Behind me, there is not a single Soviet soldier. According to the Geneva Agreement, the complete withdrawal of troops has been accomplished."

Thousands of people gathered on the high embankment of the Amu Darya, waving to the returning soldiers.

Nikolayevna from the Tatar Republic cradled her son Igor's face in her hands, examining him closely. Her hands trembled slightly. Her son, 20 years old, had spent 9 months in Afghanistan. His mother had arrived here three days earlier to wait for him.

"How do you feel now?" the reporters asked her.

"Very happy, indescribably happy," she replied, tears welling up in her eyes.

An Uzbek woman searched through the ranks of soldiers for her son, tears streaming down her face. Her son had already died in Afghanistan, but she still did not believe it, hoping for a miracle today.

Sergei, a 21-year-old soldier from the Moscow suburbs, told reporters, "I have been looking forward to this day for a long time. Every day and every moment in Afghanistan, I longed to come back."

"What do you plan to do after returning home?" I asked.

"I want to be a dentist."

Olga, a student at Moscow University, and her mother traveled from Moscow to witness the withdrawal. Olga said, "Today is a 'holiday.' But wouldn't it be better if there were no 'holiday'? If we hadn't sent troops, there would be no withdrawal. Unfortunately, history cannot be reversed, and we can only learn from it."

A welcome ceremony was held on a wide, flat area by the Amu Darya. General Gromov and local leaders spoke. As the ceremony was about to end, Ganiev, a reporter from the Uzbek Broadcasting and Television Station, said, "I believe today's date will be written in the history of our country. This was a war that should not have been fought. Over 50,000 Soviet troops were killed or wounded there, and many prisoners of war have not returned. We should not have gone there; the Afghan people should decide their own fate. Why did we make such great sacrifices? Complete withdrawal is the only choice."

His words were very insightful and expressed what many Soviet people were thinking.

### 在撤离阿富汗的最后时刻

　　在撤离阿富汗的最后时刻
    新华社记者  王宪举
    今天中午，数十辆载着３００多名苏联侦察兵的军车开着车灯，鸣着喇叭，隆隆驶过苏联西南部乌兹别克共和国与阿富汗交界处的阿姆河大桥，回到苏联边境城镇铁尔梅兹。
    莫斯科时间上午９点５５分（当地时间为中午），最后一辆装甲车在快到桥头边时停住，苏军驻阿富汗司令格罗莫夫中将跳下车，他的１４岁的儿子跑上前去紧紧抱住了父亲。一群记者一拥而上，４５岁的格罗莫夫对记者们说：“我的背后已经没有一个苏联士兵，按照日内瓦协议，完成全部撤军任务。”
    数以千计的人们聚集在阿姆河畔高高的堤岸上向归来的士兵招手。
    来自鞑靼共和国的尼古拉耶夫娜双手捧着儿子伊戈尔的脸，仔细地瞧，她的双手在微微颤抖。儿子今年２０岁，在阿富汗度过了９个月，妈妈３天前就来到这里等候。
    “您现在的心情如何？”记者们问她。
    “非常高兴，说不出来的高兴。”她泪水盈眶。
    一位乌兹别克的妇女在战士队伍中含泪寻找自己的儿子，儿子早已在阿富汗阵亡，但她还是不相信，指望今天能有奇迹出现。
    战士谢尔盖今年２１岁，莫斯科郊区人。他对记者说：“我盼望这一天很久了。我在阿富汗每日每时都盼着回来。”
    “回家后打算做什么？”我问。
    “当牙科医生。”
    莫斯科大学学生奥列加和她的母亲专程从莫斯科赶来观看撤军情景。奥列加说：“今天是‘节日’。但不是没有这个‘节日’更好吗？不出兵也就没有撤军。遗憾的是历史不能倒退，我们只能从中吸取教训。”
    在阿姆河畔的一块宽阔平地上举行了欢迎仪式。格罗莫夫中将和地方领导人讲了话。仪式快结束时，乌兹别克广播电视台记者加尼耶夫说：“我相信今天的日子将写在我国的历史中。这是一场不应该打的战争。苏联部队在那里死伤５万多人，还有许多战俘没有回来。我们本来不应该去那里，应该由阿富汗人民自己来决定自己的命运。为什么我们要作出那么大的牺牲呢？全部撤军才是唯一的选择。”
    他的这席话极为中肯，也很有见地，说出了很多苏联人的心里话。
