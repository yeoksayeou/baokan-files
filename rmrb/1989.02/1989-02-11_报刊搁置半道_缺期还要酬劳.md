Newspapers Left Midway, Missing Issues Still Require Payment

Last year, our two villages collectively subscribed to 30 types of newspapers and magazines totaling 50 copies. The Yangping Town Post Office is only 6 kilometers away from us. Normally, the delivery personnel should deliver our subscribed newspapers and magazines to the village in a timely manner. However, since the second quarter of last year, the delivery personnel have been leaving the newspapers and magazines at some "newspaper relay point" along the way, and only after a few days does someone bring a bundle of them. If we urgently need to read the newspapers or letters, we have to send someone to the "newspaper relay point" to find them, often without success. Even if we find them, or if the delivery personnel have someone bring them, it is usually the case that one issue is missing or another is extra, and it is rare for all issues to be complete. The Donggang Village Waste Treatment Plant subscribed to the China Chemical Industry News and Northwest Information Guide, but these have not been seen for a long time. Instead, we often receive issues of the Southwest Information News and Qinghai Science and Technology News, which neither of our villages has subscribed to. Donggang Primary School subscribed to the Shaanxi Education Magazine, but out of the 12 issues for the year, only 3 were received. The delivery personnel of the Yangping Town Post Office are so irresponsible in their work, yet they still demanded 100 yuan in delivery fees from the Donggang Village Waste Treatment Plant.

Regarding the delivery of newspapers, we have repeatedly reported the issue to the Yangping Town Post Office and the County Post Office, and have also complained to the provincial and municipal newspaper offices, but to no avail. Instead, we were scolded by some delivery personnel: "The more you complain, the less I will deliver!" We sincerely hope that the postal departments in our area will quickly catch up with the reforms in various industries, improve service quality, and improve their work attitude.

　　报刊搁置半道　缺期还要酬劳
    去年，我们两个村共订有报刊３０种５０份。阳平镇邮电所离我们这儿仅６公里。按说，投递员应将我们订的报刊及时送到村里。然而，自去年第二季度以来，投递员竟将报刊搁在半路上的什么“捎报点”，过几天才有人捎来一捆。我们如急着要看报刊或信件，就得派人到“捎报点”去找，往往还找不到。即使我们找到了，或者投递员让人捎到了，也是这种多一份，或那种少一份，很少有齐全的时候。东港村消洗厂订的中国化工报和西北信息导报好长时间见不着，但却常常收到我们两个村都没订阅的西南信息报、青海科技报。东港小学订的《陕西教育》杂志，全年１２期，仅收到３期。阳平镇邮电所投递员的投递工作这样不负责任，竟然还向东港村消洗厂索要了１００元送报劳务费。
    为送报的事，我们曾向阳平镇邮电所和县邮电局反映多次，也向省、市报刊投诉过，但都无济于事。反而，遭到个别投递员的斥责：“你们越告，我越是不送！”我们衷心期望我们这里的邮电部门，尽快跟上各行各业改革的步伐，提高服务质量，改善工作态度。
