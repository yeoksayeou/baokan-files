The civilian product value of the Air Force Aviation Repair System has seen rapid growth. According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9, (reporter Qi Hanxiao) the Air Force Aviation Repair System has adjusted its product structure, and in 1988, the civilian product value accounted for 57% of the total product value, which is 16 times higher than in 1983 before the adjustment.

In the past, civilian production was mainly based on labor-intensive processing. In 1983, the civilian product value accounted for only 5.2% of the total product value for that year. With the deepening of reform and opening up, the Air Force Aviation Repair Factory has, while ensuring military product production, vigorously developed civilian product production, improved the operating mechanism, and adjusted the product structure. It has now formed production capabilities in five areas, including automobiles and their parts, textile machinery, and other aspects, with 250 main products.
