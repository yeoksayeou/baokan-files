Celebrities are individuals who stand out in various fields, achieve remarkable results, and have high recognition. A country with many celebrities indicates prosperity and development. An era with many celebrities shows rapid progress. During the Cultural Revolution, those who handed in blank papers were hailed as "heroes," while hoodlums became "respected figures." True contributors to society were labeled as "monsters and demons." The era when many celebrities were persecuted was also a time of national tears and bloodshed. That dark page of history has finally been turned. Now, celebrities and experts are emerging, and whether they are old or new celebrities, they are all respected by society.

Precisely because celebrities are renowned nationwide and even internationally, and have a significant influence on society, they should cherish their reputation, avoid tarnishing their honor, and not let their admirers be disappointed.

In my opinion, the first step for celebrities to cherish their reputation is to ensure that "their name is not empty." During the Southern and Northern Dynasties, Mao Zha of the Chen Dynasty was a scholar with extensive knowledge, praised as having no empty names under his fame. This means that a person of great renown must have real achievements, as the saying goes, "fame is not in vain." People respect celebrities for their achievements in academia and their careers. The more celebrities strive for excellence, seek self-improvement, and reach new heights, the more influential they become, and the more they are welcomed by society. This can be said to be the most proactive way to cherish one's reputation. If, after gaining fame, one becomes obsessed with attending meetings and giving speeches, neglecting self-improvement, over time, it is inevitable that people will feel that "great fame often does not live up to expectations."

The way to cherish one's reputation also lies in not easily lending one's name. Currently, the trend of establishing associations and societies is prevalent, covering almost every industry, and they want to invite some celebrities to be directors, chairpersons, or honorary chairpersons. Some publications also want to invite celebrities to be editors, advisors, or honorary presidents. For celebrities, these are not things they cannot do. But they should pay attention to the fact that some organizations just want to use your name for registration, obtaining "sponsorship," or even issuing news and advertisements. One should be vigilant and not let others use one's name as a "pass" or a "money tree." Even if someone sincerely invites you to be an advisor or director, it is not advisable to accept too many offers. After all, one is not omnipotent, and it doesn't mean much to have one's name everywhere!

Cherishing one's reputation means not doing anything that harms one's reputation. For example, if one is invited to be a judge for academic papers or literary works, one should not be influenced by personal relationships and fail to be objective and fair; if one is invited to evaluate a scientific achievement or product, one should not abandon principles for generous hospitality. This will tarnish one's image. As for giving a few comments or making some revisions to the works of juniors or subordinates and then rudely signing one's own name, and even placing it in front of the real author, or demanding exorbitant fees and harsh conditions for performances, that would be even more despised by people.

Celebrities are often invited to write inscriptions. But celebrities are not omnipotent; many celebrities are not proficient in calligraphy. A celebrity's handwriting and calligraphy are often two different things. Haven't you seen some celebrities' handwriting that is crooked and messy, with characters placed horizontally and vertically, not only failing to meet artistic standards but also lacking standardization, and even creating their own characters? Using such handwriting to write inscriptions, couplets, or plaques is bound to invite ridicule. For celebrities who are not proficient in calligraphy, "cherishing ink" and hiding one's shortcomings is the way to cherish one's reputation.

The above points may not all be accurate or appropriate. But I am writing out of sincere concern for celebrities, and I hope you will forgive any mistakes!

### 名人宜惜名

　　名人宜惜名
    钟怀
    名人，是指社会各界出类拔萃、做出了突出成绩、知名度很高的人物。一个国家出的名人多，说明这个国家兴旺发达。一个时代出的名人多，说明这个时代前进的步伐快。“文革”时期，交白卷的戴上“英雄”桂冠，地痞流氓成了“响当当”，真正对社会有贡献的名人名流，反而被当作“牛鬼蛇神”。大批名人横遭摧残之日，也是全民族流泪流血之时。那一页黑暗的历史终于翻了过去。现在，名人名家辈出，不论老的名人还是新的名人，都受到社会的尊重。
    正因为名人享誉全国乃至海外，对社会的影响大，所以名人应当十分珍惜自己的名声，不使自己的声誉蒙垢，不让倾慕的群众失望。
    窃以为，名人惜名之道，首先是做到“名下无虚”。南北朝时陈代的姚察，是个学艺优博之士，被人称赞为“名下定无虚士”。就是说负盛名的人必有实学，即所谓名不虚传。人们所以尊重名人，乃是尊重他在学术上、事业上的成就。名人越是兢兢业业，孜孜以求，不断“超越自我”，达到新水平，越具有影响力，越为社会所欢迎。这可以说是珍惜自己名声最积极的办法。如果成名之后，热衷于到处开会、演讲，而疏于充实自己，久而久之，难免使人产生“盛名之下，其实难副”之感。
    惜名之道，还在于不轻易借名。时下成立学会、协会之风很盛，几乎遍及各行各业，并想拉一些名人当理事、会长、名誉会长。还有一些报刊，也要拉名人当编委、顾问、名誉社长。对名人来说，这些事不是不可以干。但要注意，有一些单位借用一下你的大名，并不是真地让你去顾去问，去理它的事，参它的政，而是出于申请登记、获取“赞助”，乃至发消息、做广告的需要。对此不可不察，不要随便让别人把自己的名字当作“通行证”、“摇钱树”。即使人家真心实意请你去当顾问、理事什么的，也不宜允诺太多，又不是三头六臂，到处挂名有多大意思！
    惜名，决不能干有损自己名声的事。比方，受聘担任某项学术论文或文艺作品评奖活动的评委，碍于情面，不能做到客观公正；应邀参加某项科技成果或产品的鉴定，因款待优厚而抛弃原则，这都会玷污自己的形象。至于对后生、下属的论著提了点意见，或作了点修改，便不客气地署上自己的大名，并且排在真正作者的前面；自恃是“星”是“秀”，参加演出漫天要价，条件苛刻，那就更为人们所不齿了。
    名人常会被人邀请题字。但名人并非万能，许多名人并不精于书法。名人写字与书法艺术往往是两回事。君不见有的名人写字歪歪倒倒，横七竖八，非但不合艺术要求，连规范化也谈不到，甚至还有自己创造的字。以此题词、题签、题匾，不免贻笑大方。对于不谙书法的名人来说，“惜墨”藏拙即惜名。
    以上所云，不一定都确切妥当。但我是出于爱护名人的一片赤诚，失礼之处，尚希原谅！
